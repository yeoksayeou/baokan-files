　　《Same River》 is a deeply moving work of Vietnamese young film art. Its anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist theme is very clear, and the characters' personalities are also very well portrayed. Although the protagonists, Xiao Huai and A Yun, live on both sides of the Bian Hai River, and their love was formed in the guerrilla war against imperialism, on the day of their wedding, it was disrupted by the sudden blockade of the river by the reactionary regime on the south bank, which was a puppet of American imperialism. This couple, about to be married, was separated on both sides of the river, within sight but unable to unite. American imperialism has always been hostile to the socialist camp and has always carried out various activities to sabotage socialist countries. It instructed its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, to openly violate the Geneva Conference agreement. The fact that Xiao Huai and A Yun's wedding was blocked, even though it was a small matter, proves this point. Later, with the help of the working people on both sides of the river, Xiao Huai finally escaped to the north bank and was reunited. Therefore, it can be said that the real protagonists in the film, in addition to Xiao Huai and A Yun, are the working people on both sides of the Bian Hai River. The working people are the main driving force of all revolutions, especially the diligent and brave Vietnamese working people who have been tempered by revolution for a long time. Under the correct leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party headed by President Ho Chi Minh, they are even more invincible and unstoppable!

　　Ngo Dinh Diem, this vicious executioner who slaughtered the people of South Vietnam and divided the Vietnamese homeland, is actually just an instrument of aggression for the common enemy of the world, American imperialism, nothing more; American imperialism is truly the chief culprit in harming the Vietnamese people. This point is also clearly demonstrated in the film "Same River" from the negative characters such as the pseudo-police chief on the south bank who wanted to insult Xiao Huai, and the pseudo-officials who launched the anti-communist movement. Behind this small group of running dogs, the one pulling the strings is still the American imperialist. People feel the same way, whether they are the people of North and South Vietnam or the people of other countries, they will never be fooled by American imperialism. Therefore, the anti-communist movement could not be launched, and the agents sent to the north bank of the river were also caught. The despicable conspiracies of that small group of ugly reactionary elements were all thoroughly and devastatingly hit and failed, and the people finally won the final victory. However, is this just the story of this film? Did it only happen on both sides of the Bian Hai River? No, it is a symbol. After a long and arduous struggle, the Vietnamese people will surely drive away American imperialism and its running dogs, and achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland. Therefore, this film has a great educational effect on the people of all countries.

　　Vietnam, this diligent and brave, hard-working country, a country of poetry, a passionate country of the South, a rich and beautiful country, is also a country that is determined and brave in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. In the past struggles against France, Japan, and the United States, it is truly unknown how many outstanding socialist and communist heroes and heroines have been trained. From the film "Same River", we can see how those ordinary young people have grown and become strong. From them, we can clearly see the tomorrow of Vietnam.

　　As a friend of the Vietnamese people, I have had the opportunity to visit our heroic fraternal country, visit many provinces and cities and industrial and mining enterprises, and meet many Vietnamese friends. Whenever I think of them, I am really excited and fascinated! A mere river, of course, cannot separate the North and South Vietnamese people who are linked heart to heart; thousands of mountains and rivers, how can they separate the evergreen friendship and common determination to struggle between our Chinese and Vietnamese people! The American imperialists who are building military bases everywhere and trying to enslave the people of the world, their reckless actions only serve to provide more negative teaching material for the worldwide people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism.

    从越南影片《同一条江》谈起
    陈翔鹤
    《同一条江》是越南年轻的电影艺术感人甚深的作品。它的反帝国主义、反殖民主义的主题是十分鲜明的，人物个性也刻划得很突出。片中的主人翁小怀和阿运虽然同生活在边海河的两岸，而且他们的恋爱又是在反对帝国主义的游击战中所形成的，然而临到迎婚的那一天，却被南岸的甘为美帝国主义傀儡的反动政权突然封锁江面所破坏了；这一对行将新婚的夫妇被隔离在江的两面，可望而不得成亲。美帝国主义一贯与社会主义阵营为敌，一贯进行各种破坏社会主义国家的活动。它指使走狗吴庭艳集团，公然违反日内瓦会议的协定。从小怀和阿运的婚期被阻这件小事上，也证明了这一点。后来，由于江两岸劳动人民的援助，小怀终于逃到了北岸，得以团圆。因此，可以这样说：影片里真正的主人翁，除小怀、阿运两人外，就要算边海河两岸的劳动人民了。劳动人民是一切革命的主要动力，尤其是勤劳勇敢、久经革命锻炼的越南劳动人民，在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的正确领导下，更是能无坚不摧，锐不可当！
    吴庭艳这个穷凶极恶，残杀南越人民，割裂越南河山的刽子手，实际上也不过是全世界共同敌人美帝国主义的一种侵略工具，如此而已；美帝国主义实在是残害越南人民的首恶元凶。这一点，在《同一条江》影片中，从南岸的想侮辱小怀的伪派出所所长，发动反共运动的伪官员等等反面人物的身上，也表现得十分明白。在这一小撮走狗们的背后，担任牵线人的，仍是美帝国主义者。人同此心，心同此理，不论其为南北越的人民或其他国家的人民，都是决不会上美帝国主义的当的。因此，反共运动反不起来，派往江北岸的特务也被抓住，那一小群丑恶的反动分子的可耻阴谋，全都彻底地遭到毁灭性的打击，而归于失败，人民终于争得了最后的胜利。然而，这难道只是这一部影片的故事吗？难道只发生在边海河两岸吗？不，它是一个象征，在经过长期的、艰苦的斗争之后，越南人民一定会赶走美帝国主义及其走狗，使自己的祖国达到和平统一。因此，这部影片对于各国人民的教育作用是很大的。
    越南，这个勤劳勇敢，艰苦奋斗之国，诗歌之国、南方热情之国、富饶美丽之国，同时又是在反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义斗争中坚决勇敢之国，它在历来的反法、反日、反美的斗争中，真不知锻炼出了多少优秀的社会主义、共产主义的英雄儿女。从影片《同一条江》里，我们可以看到那些普通的青年人怎样成长锻炼得坚强起来。从他们身上，我们清清楚楚地看到越南的明天。
    作为越南人民的一个朋友，我曾有机会访问过我们的英雄的兄弟之邦，访问过许多省市和工矿，认识了不少越南朋友。每当一想起他们来，就实在太令人兴奋而为之神往不已了！区区的一条江水，当然不能隔断心连心的南北越人民；千重山万重水，又何尝能隔断我们中越两国人民万古常青的友谊和共同斗争的决心呢！那到处建立军事基地、企图奴役全世界人民的美帝国主义者，它的胡作非为，其作用只不过更多地供给锻炼全世界人民反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义斗争的反面教材罢了。（附图片）
