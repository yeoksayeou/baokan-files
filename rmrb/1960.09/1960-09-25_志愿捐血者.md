　　Voluntary Blood Donors
    In the Spassky district of the Primorsky Krai in the Soviet Union, residents suddenly heard an urgent appeal from the local hospital on the radio: "To save a critically ill patient, blood from someone who has suffered burns is urgently needed…."

    At that time, in the hospital, a thirteen-year-old boy named Vitya was struggling on the brink of death. He had used gasoline to light a samovar, which exploded, causing him severe burns. After being sent to the hospital, Vitya remained unconscious. Doctors and nurses actively rescued him, never leaving his bedside for a moment, but a day and a half passed, and the injured boy's condition continued to deteriorate. The attending physician, Maritskaya, determined that the patient must receive a blood transfusion immediately, and it had to be blood from someone who had been burned. However, the hospital could not find this type of blood, so they had to appeal to the general public for help.

    Less than a quarter of an hour after the appeal was issued, the first group of volunteer blood donors had arrived at the hospital.

    "Draw my blood immediately to save the child." The first to arrive at the hospital, a Komsomol member and weigher at the station, Glechuk, resolutely held out his hand. On his face and hands, one could see the marks of burns from his childhood.

    "My blood is the most suitable. I am the same age as Vitya," Yura Mitvedev, a student at the Sixth Middle School, told the doctor.

    "I also have a child, I understand the feelings of a mother, and I know the severity of burns, so I came to donate blood," said Maria Stavrova, a telephone operator.

    Within half an hour, twenty-five people had arrived at the hospital, including workers, collective farm members, students, and housewives.

    Vitya's condition finally gradually improved. The blood of those selfless Soviet people saved the boy's life.

　  志愿捐血者
    在苏联滨海区斯巴斯基地方，居民们从广播中突然听到当地医院的一个紧急呼吁：“为了拯救垂危的病人，迫切需要曾经受到火伤的人的血液……。”
    这时，在医院里，十三岁的男孩子维佳，正在死亡的边缘挣扎着。他由于用汽油来点燃大茶炊，结果茶炊爆炸，使他受到严重的火伤。送到医院后，维佳一直昏迷不醒。大夫和护士积极抢救，片刻不离病床，但是一天半过去了，伤者的情况继续恶化。主治医师玛利茨卡雅断定，必须马上给病人输血，而且非要曾被烧伤过的人的血液不可。但是医院里找不到这种血，因此只好向广大居民请求帮助。
    呼吁发出后不到一刻钟，第一批志愿输血者已经来到医院。
    “马上抽我的血救小孩。”首先赶到医院的车站过磅员、共青团员格列楚克坚决地伸出手来。在他的脸上和手上，可以看到他童年时代烧伤的痕迹。
    “我的血最合适不过了。我同维佳同年。”第六中学的学生尤拉·密特维杰夫向医生诉说。
    “我也有一个小孩，我了解做母亲的心情，我也知道烧伤的严重性，所以我跑来捐血。”电话接线生玛丽雅·斯塔夫洛娃说。
    在半小时内，已经有二十五人来到医院，其中有工人、集体农庄庄员、学生和家庭主妇。
    维佳的情况终于逐渐好转了。那些舍己为人的苏维埃人的血液，拯救了这个男孩子的生命。
