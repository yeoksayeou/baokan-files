　  Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 22nd: According to a report in today's "Akahata" newspaper, membership in the Japanese Communist Party is rapidly increasing throughout the country. As of September 21st, the number of prefectures where Communist Party membership has doubled has reached sixteen.
    Newly completed prefectures in achieving the goal of doubling membership include Aichi Prefecture, Gunma Prefecture, and Hyogo Prefecture.
    "Akahata" pointed out that the number of communist party members in Aichi Prefecture is now second only to Fukuoka Prefecture, which has the largest number of party members. Gunma Prefecture is a place where struggles against the "Security Treaty" are carried out on a broad basis. In addition, Hyogo Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture are Japanese industrial centers where many workers are influenced by the right-wing All-Japan Trade Union Conference.
    Prior to this, Saga, Ibaraki, Toyama, Fukui, Fukuoka, Niigata, Kochi and other prefectures had already overfulfilled their targets of doubling party membership. They are now working to further develop and consolidate the strength of the party.
