　　In Front of the Hotel Where Castro Resides
　　Tens of Thousands of New Yorkers Demonstrate in Support of the Cuban Revolution
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 22nd: According to a TASS report from New York, a large demonstration in support of the Cuban Revolution, attended by 10,000 people, was held on the evening of the 21st in front of the Theresa Hotel in Harlem, where the head of the Cuban delegation to the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Cuban Prime Minister Castro, was staying.
    The demonstrators carried Cuban flags and shouted slogans in support of Castro and Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba.
    Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, 21st: The Chilean newspaper "El Siglo" today published an editorial entitled "Anti-Cuban Provocation," condemning the U.S. government's harassment and unreasonable treatment of Cuban Prime Minister Castro, who is attending the United Nations General Assembly.
    The editorial said that the treatment Castro received in the United States once again proves the U.S. rulers' disregard for the principles of democracy and peaceful coexistence. The editorial said, "All of this ultimately shows the annoyance of U.S. imperialism because a small country in front of it can take actions with courage and dignity unparalleled in any country in the Americas."
    The editorial concluded that these foolish and dirty provocations against Castro and other members of the Cuban delegation once again demonstrate the moral and strength-based weakness of imperialism.

　　在卡斯特罗居住的旅馆门前
　　纽约万人示威支持古巴革命
    新华社22日讯  据塔斯社纽约讯：21日晚上在出席联合国大会第十五届会议的古巴代表团团长、古巴总理卡斯特罗居住的哈林姆区赛里萨旅馆前面举行了声援古巴革命的大示威，参加示威的有一万人。
    示威者拿着古巴的国旗，高呼声援卡斯特罗以及刚果总理卢蒙巴的口号。
    新华社圣地亚哥21日电　智利“世纪报”今天以反古巴的挑衅为题发表社论，谴责美国政府对出席联合国大会的古巴总理卡斯特罗的刁难和无理对待。
    社论说，卡斯特罗在美国所受到的待遇再次证明美国执政者对民主和和平共处的准则的漠视。社论说，“这一切归根结底表明了美帝国主义的恼怒，因为一个小国在它的面前能以在美洲任何国家中都不能比拟的勇气和尊严采取行动”。
    社论最后说，这些反对卡斯特罗及古巴代表团其他成员的愚蠢和肮脏的挑衅阴谋，再一次表明了帝国主义道义上和力量上的软弱。
