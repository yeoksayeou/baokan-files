Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch from Leopoldville: Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba held a press conference in Leopoldville on the 20th, reaffirming that he is still the Prime Minister of the Congolese government and that his government is still in power. Lumumba accused the United Nations of "standing by and watching" the "development of anarchy" caused by the coup launched by Mobutu.

Lumumba has previously pointed out that imperialism bought off Mobutu, and someone gave Mobutu five million francs to overthrow the Congolese government.

At the press conference, the first in nearly ten days, Lumumba said: "Colonel Mobutu's armed bandits are committing theft, kidnapping parliamentarians, looting, and raping women." He believes that the United Nations should "disarm these rebel troops."

Lumumba said that because he could not get transportation, he could not attend the United Nations General Assembly to state the truth about what happened in the Congo. Earlier, Lumumba had accused the United Nations of obstructing him from going to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly.

Lumumba also revealed to reporters the truth about forcing the Soviet and Czechoslovak embassies in the Congo to temporarily evacuate the Congo. He said that the action to force the diplomatic personnel of these two countries to leave the Congo was the result of planning by "a certain foreign country that hoped to drive the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia out (of the Congo)." Lumumba pointed out, "This is a very big country." Although Lumumba did not further name this country, people know that just after the embassies of these two socialist countries had just evacuated, some Western newspapers triumphantly declared: "This is a victory for American foreign policy."

Lumumba pointed out at the press conference that, apart from the army in Leopoldville being divided, the Congolese army in other places still supports him.

At the same time, Mobutu, who launched the rebellion, brazenly announced on the 20th the establishment of a so-called "Commission of Commissioners" to exercise government functions in order to step up the conspiracy to subvert the Congolese government. According to Agence France-Presse, the commission of about fifteen people was appointed by Kasavubu.

That morning, Mobutu also sent his reactionary troops to occupy the Congolese government building, rudely driving out officials of the legitimate Congolese government.

　　卢蒙巴举行记者招待会
　  重申他仍为刚果总理　他的政府仍然当政
    蒙博托悍然宣布成立所谓“专员委员会”行使政府职权
    新华社21日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果总理卢蒙巴20日在利奥波德维尔举行记者招待会，重申他仍然是刚果政府的总理，他的政府仍然当政。卢蒙巴指责联合国“正站在一旁看着”由蒙博托发动政变所引起的“无政府状态的发展”。
    卢蒙巴过去曾指出，帝国主义收买了蒙博托，有人给蒙博托五百万法郎，要他推翻刚果政府。
    卢蒙巴在近十天以来第一次举行的记者招待会上说：“蒙博托上校的武装匪帮进行盗窃、绑架议员，进行掠夺和强奸妇女”。他认为，联合国应当“解除这些叛军的武装”。
    卢蒙巴说，由于他得不到交通工具，他无法出席联合国大会陈诉刚果所发生的真实情况。早些时候，卢蒙巴曾指责联合国阻挠他去纽约出席联合国大会。
    卢蒙巴还向记者们揭露了迫使苏联和捷克斯洛伐克驻刚果大使馆暂时撤离刚果的真相。他说，强迫这两国驻刚果的外交人员离开刚果的行动，是由于“某一个希望把苏联和捷克斯洛伐克（从刚果）赶出去的外国进行策划的结果”。卢蒙巴指出，“这是一个很大的国家”。虽然卢蒙巴没有进一步说出这个国家的名字，但是，人们知道，就在这两个社会主义国家使馆刚刚撤离之后，一些西方报刊就曾得意地宣称：“这是美国外交政策的胜利”。
    卢蒙巴在记者招待会上指出，除了利奥波德维尔的陆军是分裂的以外，其他地方的刚果陆军仍然是支持他的。
    在这同时，发动叛乱的蒙博托为了加紧进行颠覆刚果政府的阴谋，20日竟悍然宣布成立一个所谓“专员委员会”来行使政府职权。据法新社报道，为数大约十五人的专员，是由卡萨武布任命的。
    当天上午，蒙博托还指派他的反动军队占领了刚果政府大厦，把刚果合法政府的官员粗暴地赶了出去。
