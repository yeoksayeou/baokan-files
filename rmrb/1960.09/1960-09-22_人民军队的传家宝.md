    During a visit to the Chinese People's Revolution Military Museum, I met Qiu Huiying, a family member of revolutionary martyr Li Bai from Shanghai, the beloved wife of the protagonist in the movie "The Eternal Radio Wave," a respected female soldier. She was leading her fifteen-year-old son, Li Hengsheng, on a tour, recounting the heroic stories of the revolutionary predecessors and the People's Army. When she stood before the portrait and relics of Li Bai, she emotionally said to her son: "Your father dedicated his life to the revolution, and all that remains of him is displayed here. This is the lofty honor given to him by the Party and the country. He was a Young Pioneer leader in the Soviet area when he was young, and you are a Young Pioneer now. You must learn from your father, learn from the People's Liberation Army uncles, learn their revolutionary will and hard-working, simple style, and always be a good soldier of Chairman Mao...."
    Since the opening of the Military Museum, I have seen thousands upon thousands of visitors, just like Qiu Huiying, using simple and emotional language, affectionately passing on the glorious traditions of the Party and the People's Army to their children, to the young generation of New China. They say that this is the family heirloom of the Chinese people's revolution.
    The large number of cultural relics in the Military Museum lead people into the arduous years of revolutionary war. With respectful hearts, we see the red flag that once fluttered on Jinggang Mountain, and the spear engraved with "Long Live Revolutionary Success" from the Autumn Harvest Uprising. The photos of the snow-capped mountains and grasslands that the Red Army traversed during the 25,000-li Long March, and the models of the Red Army's daring crossing of the Jinsha River and the Dadu River, remind us of Chairman Mao's magnificent lines, "The Red Army fears not the trials of a distant march; To them a thousand mountains, a myriad rivers, are nothing." During the most difficult days of the Long March, due to extreme lack of supplies, the Red Army once dug wild vegetables and grass roots to satisfy their hunger. Sometimes, when there were no wild vegetables, they would cut tree bark to eat, and even ate their own belts. Now, the knives and scissors that these revolutionary predecessors used to dig wild vegetables and cut tree bark, the broken copper ladles they used to cook food and boil water, the hemp vests they wore for warmth, and the specimens of wild vegetables and grasses they relied on to fill their stomachs: cat grass, elm bark, wanyangzi vegetables, kudzu root, and wild foxglove, are all displayed before us. "Wild vegetables are delicious, wild grass is fragrant, feeding the hungry intestines of the Red Army. What does it matter if there is no rice or noodles? The Red Army's granary is all over the mountains!" This was the battle song of the Red Army soldiers in the face of difficulties. It was with this noble revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism that they endured all kinds of hardships, broke through barriers, and killed tens of thousands of enemy troops who were pursuing and intercepting the Red Army, writing the brilliant history of the 25,000-li Long March.
    Also on display here are many cultural relics from the munitions factories and military hospitals that the Red Army and the people of the old Soviet areas built from scratch, through arduous struggle, under the enemy's tight blockade, shining with the light of infinite wisdom. The items used by the Red Army on Hainan Island more than twenty years ago: boiled reeds to be used as gauze, banana tree bark rolled up to be used as bandages, bamboo made into hot water buckets, coconut shells broken open to be used as rice bowls, sea buckthorn fruits strung together to be used as lamps, and coconut branches and trunks used to make slippers for the wounded and sick soldiers, as well as beautiful tear-stained bamboo used to make flutes and walking sticks, so that the wounded and sick soldiers could both support themselves and play music. ...
  "These are not ordinary exhibits, they are vivid teaching materials." Lu Baoqi, a medical worker who was visiting with me, said excitedly: "As long as I see them, I think of the great spirit of the Red Army. How many difficulties did the Red Army overcome for the revolution and for the people! And how much better are our conditions today, what difficulties can't we overcome with the spirit of the Red Army?!"
    The great victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan demonstrated the heroic spirit of the Chinese nation. The cultural relics in the War of Resistance Against Japan Museum tell us: during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were many difficulties. The military and civilians in the anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, not only used inferior weapons and equipment to resist the enemy, who had superior forces and equipment; moreover, the military and civilians in the base areas lived a very hard and simple life. On display here are the bedding and equipment used by the Eighth Route Army when crossing the Yellow River in 1938 - old coarse cloth military uniforms with patches, cloth satchels, broken bamboo hats, and straw sandals made by the soldiers themselves from strips of cloth and hemp rope. The food eaten by the military and civilians in the anti-Japanese base areas in North and Northwest China during extremely difficult times - black bean cakes, buckwheat husks, wheat bran, and sorghum stalk hearts.... The soldiers of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, fighting in the white mountains and black waters, often could not get food, and took acorns from the mountains, ground them into flour to satisfy their hunger, and persisted in marching and fighting day and night, heroically attacking the enemy and rescuing the great Chinese nation. When we recited General Li Zhaolin's posthumous work "Song of Camping" word by word, a lofty respect welled up in our hearts.
  "The north wind roars, the heavy snow flies, the war horses hesitate, the cold air attacks, it is difficult to sleep at night. The fire warms the chest, the wind chills the back, brave men, sincerely strive to sweep across the Nenjiang Plain...."
    Our great leader Chairman Mao, in 1942, when the War of Resistance Against Japan entered an extremely difficult year, in order to overcome difficulties, reduce the burden on the people, and persist in the War of Resistance, put forward the call to develop production. All troops, Party and government organs, and school personnel in the liberated areas started to work with their own hands, setting off a large-scale production upsurge. Now, in the War of Resistance Against Japan Museum, we see Chairman Mao's inscription for the army to carry out the large-scale production movement: "Rely on Ourselves," "Ample Food and Clothing." There are also photos of Chairman Mao working in production with the soldiers of the Eighth Route Army in Yan'an, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's sickle for cutting horse grass and firewood, Commander Chen Yi's wooden rake for planting vegetables, the iron rakes and hoes used by the 359th Brigade in Nanniwan for reclaiming wasteland and production, and the daily necessities such as military uniforms, cloth shoes, wool socks, and blankets produced by the Eighth Route Army, New Fourth Army, and guerrillas in the various anti-Japanese base areas during the large-scale production movement, as well as a large number of photos and documents reflecting the grand occasion of production at that time. The people's soldiers thus took up guns in one hand and hoes in the other, carrying out the tasks of combat and production. They declared war on the barren mountains, sometimes using armed cover, working under the stars and moon, drilling into the land not far from the enemy's bunkers to plant crops. Nanniwan in northern Shaanxi, which was once uninhabited, was transformed into the "Jiangnan of northern Shaanxi" under the joint reclamation of General Wang Zhen's 359th Brigade and fraternal troops, with crops everywhere and cattle and sheep everywhere. The museum displays a worn-out mattock and hoe used by Hao Shucai, an Eighth Route Army soldier who was selected as a special-class labor model in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, in Nanniwan's reclamation and production. He used this mattock to reclaim more than 100 mu of wasteland in one year and harvested 84 shi of millet; he used this hoe to hoe six mu of land a day and was praised as "angering the ox." Also on display here is the first wool blanket produced by the Eighth Route Army Wool Weaving Factory, which shows that the Eighth Route Army and Party and government organs, while carrying out agricultural production, regardless of men and women, cadres and soldiers, learned to use spinning wheels to spin yarn. People with high skills could spin several taels of cotton every day in their spare time. Those without spinning wheels used a bamboo chopstick with a wooden support attached to the bottom to twist yarn and wool, and with their own hands, they knitted wool socks and wool gloves, and wove coarse cloth and towels. Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Ren Bishi used spinning wheels sent by General Wang Zhen to learn to spin yarn, and the yarn they spun was even exhibited at the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region's Agricultural and Industrial Production Achievement Exhibition. The logistics department of the Eighth Route Army, in order to vigorously develop the textile industry, made its own earthen machine and wove beautiful and practical blankets from earthen wool.
    Walking into the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Museum, we saw that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army carried forward the fine tradition of hard work and thus defeated the most ferocious US imperialism together with the Korean People's Army. The heroic sons and daughters of China, on the Korean battlefield, were tenacious and unyielding, stepping into the breach as others fell, enduring hunger and starvation in the days of "a handful of fried noodles and a handful of snow," attacking the enemy; fighting continuously in the freezing cold of minus forty degrees Celsius, on high mountains with several feet of snow. On display here are the fried rice and fried noodles that the Volunteer Army ate in the early days of entering Korea, and various simple clothing items used for protection against the cold. There are also two withered leaves here, which come from the Feihu Mountain battlefield of that year. That was the difficult year of 1950, when a certain unit of the Volunteer Army held Feihu Mountain. In the three days and three nights of fierce fighting, the soldiers had no food to eat and no water to drink. They only licked the water droplets on the leaves with their dry and fiery tongues in the gaps between battles to moisten their throats filled with gunpowder, and then they continued to pick up their weapons, lift stones and fight the enemy, persisting until the victory of the battle. The life photos and objects of the Volunteer Army troops in the famous Battle of Shangganling, who fought hard, are even more moving. Among them, there is an iron bucket riddled with bullet and shrapnel holes, which was used by the brave soldiers who held the tunnels to snatch water from the ravines at night, braving the enemy's artillery fire, in the absence of water. For a bucket of water, they sometimes had to bleed, get injured, and even sacrifice their lives. I saw many visitors shed tears of emotion when visiting these cultural relics. A mother holding a baby constantly murmured the name "Huang Jiguang." She said to her child to herself, "This is the place where Uncle Huang Jiguang sacrificed his life. He used his body to block the enemy's gun holes so that the Volunteer Army uncles behind him could attack the top of the mountain and annihilate the American bandits."
    When we walked into the Museum for the Defense of Socialist Construction, what we saw was a moving picture of the People's Liberation Army building the country and the army with diligence and thrift. Generals served as soldiers, and cadres went down to the company. The "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" lived in the bustling city of Shanghai, but remained spotless. In order to reduce the burden on the country and the people and improve the lives of the troops, under the principle of not affecting duty and training, the entire army universally carried out agricultural and sideline production, and "Nanniwan" was everywhere. On display here are some of the fruits of production, including a 76-jin wax gourd, a 40-jin cabbage, and a 1,152-jin big fat pig. In 1958, the year when the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction began in the motherland, officers and soldiers of the entire army harvested more than 400 million jin of self-grown vegetables and raised more than 420,000 pigs. Many troops have since achieved partial or complete self-sufficiency in vegetables and meat. Also on display here are models of barracks built by the troops themselves. Most of the barracks were self-built, saving a lot of money for the country. In the movement to practice strict economy, the entire army also implemented a system of collecting and using old items, disassembling and washing the collected old military uniforms, and processing them into work clothes, cotton linings, and cloth shoe soles, and the collected old shoe rubber soles were made into recycled rubber. After the coal-saving stoves successfully transformed by the troops were promoted and used throughout the army, the standard for coal use was reduced from 1.5 jin per person per day to 1 jin. The people's soldiers cherish every gun, every bullet, every needle, and every thread of the motherland's people at all times.
    The audience saw the photos of Chairman Mao and the People's Liberation Army soldiers working together at the construction site of the Ming Tombs Reservoir with high respect, and the "Glorious Shovel" used by Chairman Mao. At the same time, we also saw a large number of pictures and objects showing that from the scorching sun of Hainan Island to the frigid "Great Northern Wilderness," from the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, the Kangzang Plateau to the Fujian Front, wherever there are sons and daughters of the people, there are large labor forces in military uniform. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps irrigated the dry Gobi Desert with their sweat for ten years as one day, turning it into the "granary" and "cotton warehouse" of the northwest border of the motherland. The Railway Corps, fighting in the mountains year after year, "moved mountains and filled the sea," building bridges and roads day and night, leading socialist trains in all directions. In the rich fields of the People's Commune, at the construction sites of reservoirs and on the front lines of vigorously developing iron and steel..., the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, together with the masses of the people, were close and intimate, fighting heroically, and became models on the construction front. The people praised: "The old Red Army is back!" "The old Eighth Route Army is back!"
    After visiting the Military Museum, the broad masses of the people said that this is the richest and most vivid university for revolutionary tradition education. (Attached picture)

    人民军队的传家宝
　　新华社记者　姜庆肇
    在参观中国人民革命军事博物馆的时候，我遇见从上海来的一位革命烈士家属裘慧英，她就是“永不消逝的电波”电影中的主人翁李白烈士的爱人，一位受人尊敬的女战士。她领着十五岁的儿子李恒胜，边参观边讲述革命前辈和人民军队的英雄故事。当她站在李白烈士的遗像和遗物前时，感情激动地向孩子说：“你爸爸一生为革命，剩下的东西都陈列在这里。这是党和国家给他的崇高荣誉。他小时候是苏区的少先队长，你现在也是少先队员了。要向爸爸学习，向解放军叔叔学习，学习他们的革命意志和艰苦朴素作风，永远做毛主席的好战士……。”
    从军事博物馆开放以来，我看到千千万万观众也和裘慧英一样，用那朴素和激动的语言，亲切地向自己的儿女，向新中国年青一代，传颂着党和人民军队的光荣传统。他们说，这是中国人民革命的传家宝。
    军事博物馆里的大量文物，把人们引进艰苦的革命战争年代。我们怀着崇敬的心情，看到那面曾经飘扬在井冈山上的红旗，看到那支刻着“革命成功万岁”的秋收起义的梭镖。红军在两万五千里长征中，走过的雪山、草地的照片和强渡金沙江、大渡河天险的模型，使我们想起毛主席的“红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲”的壮丽诗句。红军在长征最艰苦的日子里，由于物资极端缺乏，曾经挖野菜、草根充饥，有时候连野菜都没有，就割树皮吃，甚至吃掉了自己的皮带。现在，这些革命前辈当年挖野菜、割树皮用的刀子和剪子，煮食物和烧水用的破铜瓢，御寒穿的棕麻背心，赖以充饥的野菜、野草的标本：猫儿草、榆树皮、壪养子菜、山葛根、野地黄等，都陈列在我们面前。“野菜好吃野草香，喂饱红军饥饿肠，没米没面算什么？红军粮库遍山岗！”这是红军战士在困难面前的战歌。他们就是以这种崇高的革命英雄气概和革命乐观主义精神，历尽千辛万苦，斩关夺隘，杀退了数十万向红军围追堵截的敌军，写下了两万五千里光辉的长征史。
    这里还陈列着红军和老苏区人民当年在敌人层层封锁下，白手起家，艰苦奋斗，建设起来的许多兵工厂和军医院的文物，闪烁着无限智慧的光芒。海南岛的红军在二十多年前使用的物品：把篓毛叶煮过当纱布，芭蕉树皮卷起来当绷带，竹子做成了开水桶，椰子壳破开当饭碗，海棠果串起来当灯点，用椰子的枝叶和树杆给伤病员制拖鞋，还用美丽的泪斑竹做成箫笛手杖，使伤病员既可扶持又可吹奏。……
  “这不是普通的展览品，这是生动的活教材。”一位和我一起参观的医务工作者陆宝琪激动地说：“只要看到它们，就想到红军的伟大精神。红军为革命为人民，克服了多少困难！而我们今天的条件又有多好，有什么艰苦困难不能用红军的精神去克服呢？！”
    抗日战争的伟大胜利表现了中华民族的英雄气概。抗日战争馆里的文物告诉我们：在八年抗日战争的年代里，困难重重。敌后抗日根据地的军民，在党和毛主席领导下，不仅使用着低劣的武器装备，抗击着兵力和装备上占优势的敌人；而且，根据地的军民过着十分艰苦朴素的生活。这里陈列着八路军在1938年东渡黄河时用的被服和装具——带补钉的老粗布军装、土布挂包、破斗笠、战士们自己用布条和麻绳打成的草鞋。华北、西北等抗日根据地军民在极端困难时期吃的食物——黑豆饼、荞麦皮、麦麸和高粱秆心……。战斗在白山黑水间的东北抗日联军战士们，常常吃不上粮食，而采取山上的橡子磨成面充饥，日夜坚持行军作战，英勇地打击敌人，拯救着伟大的中华民族。当我们一字一句地朗诵着李兆麟将军的遗作“露营之歌”时，心头涌起崇高的敬意。
  “朔风怒吼，大雪飞扬，征马踟蹰，冷气袭人夜难眠。火烤胸前暖，风吹背后寒，壮士们，精诚奋斗横扫嫩江原……。”
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，在1942年当抗日战争进入极端艰苦的年头时，为了克服困难、减轻人民负担，坚持抗战，提出了发展生产的号召。解放区所有部队、党政机关和学校人员，都自己动起手来，掀起了大规模的生产热潮。现在，在抗日战争馆里，我们看到毛主席当年为军队开展大生产运动的题字：“自己动手”，“丰衣足食”。还有毛主席在延安和八路军战士一起生产劳动的照片，朱总司令割马草、打柴用的镰刀，陈毅军长种菜用的木耙，三五九旅在南泥湾开荒生产用的铁耙、锄头，各抗日根据地八路军、新四军和游击队在大生产运动中自己生产的军衣、布鞋、毛袜、毛毯等日用品和大量反映当时生产盛况的照片和文献。人民的子弟兵就是这样一手拿枪，一手拿锄，执行着作战和生产的任务。他们向荒山开战，有时用武装掩护，披星戴月，钻到离敌人碉堡不远的土地上种庄稼。曾经是荒无人烟的陕北南泥湾，在王震将军率领的三五九旅和兄弟部队的共同开垦下，变成了“陕北的好江南”，遍地是庄稼，处处是牛羊。博物馆里陈列着当年被选为陕甘宁边区特等劳动模范、八路军战士郝树材在南泥湾开荒生产中使用的一把磨秃了的镢头和锄头，他用这把镢头在一年中开荒一百多亩，打糜子八十四石；他用这把锄头一天锄地六亩，被誉为“气死牛”。这里还陈列着八路军毛织厂生产的第一条毛毯，它表明：八路军和党、政机关，在进行农业生产的同时，还不分男女，不分干部和战士，都学着使用纺车纺线，技术高的人每天在工余时间可纺几两棉花。没有纺车的人用一根竹筷下边扎一个木托来捻线、捻羊毛，凭着自己的双手，织出了羊毛袜子和羊毛手套，织出了粗布和毛巾。周恩来同志和任弼时同志用王震将军送给的纺车学纺线，纺的线还参加了陕甘宁边区农工业生产成绩展览会的展出。八路军后勤部门为了大搞纺织业，自己制造了一台土机器，用土羊毛织出了十分美观实用的毛毯。
    走进抗美援朝战争馆，我们看到了中国人民志愿军发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，从而和朝鲜人民军一起打败了最凶恶的美帝国主义。英雄的中华儿女，在朝鲜战场上，顽强不屈，前仆后继，在“一把炒面一把雪”的日子里忍饥挨饿，打击敌人；在零下四十度的冰雪寒天，在积雪数尺的高山上，连续作战。这里陈列着志愿军入朝作战初期吃的炒米和炒面，御寒防冻用的各种简单的服装用品。这里还有两片枯树叶，它来自当年飞虎山战场上。那是艰苦的1950年，志愿军某部坚守飞虎山，在三天三夜的激战中，战士们没有饭吃、没有水喝，只是在战斗的空隙，用干燥火辣的舌头，舔一舔树叶上的水珠，润湿一下被硝烟充塞的喉咙，然后，他们继续端起武器，搬起石头和敌人作战，一直坚持到战斗的胜利。著名的上甘岭战役中的志愿军部队艰苦作战的生活照片和实物，更加动人，它们当中有一个被子弹和炮弹皮打得千疮百孔的铁桶，是英勇坚守坑道的战士们在没有水喝的情况下，黑夜冒着敌人的炮火到山沟去夺水用的。他们为了一桶水，有时候不得不流血、负伤、甚至献出生命。我看见许多观众在参观这些文物时流下了感动的眼泪。一位怀抱着婴儿的母亲不断地叨念着“黄继光”的名字，她自言自语地向孩子说：“这就是黄继光叔叔牺牲的地方，他用身子堵住了敌人的枪眼，使后面的志愿军叔叔打上山顶，歼灭了美国强盗。”
    当我们走进保卫社会主义建设馆时，看到的是一幅人民解放军勤俭建国和勤俭建军的动人景象。将军当兵，干部下连。“南京路上好八连”身居上海闹市，一尘不染。为了减轻国家和人民的负担，改善部队生活，在不影响执勤和训练的原则下，全军普遍地进行了农副业生产，到处都是“南泥湾”。这里陈列着一部分生产果实，有七十六斤重的冬瓜，四十斤重的白菜，一千一百五十二斤重的大肥猪。1958年，在祖国社会主义建设大跃进开始的一年里，全军官兵共收获自种蔬菜四亿多斤，养猪四十二万多头。许多部队从此作到了蔬菜和肉食部分或全部自给。这里还陈列着部队自己动手兴建的营房的模型，全军大部分营房自建，为国家节约了大量资金。在厉行节约运动中，全军还执行了收旧用旧的制度，把收回的旧军装拆洗加工后，制成工作服、棉衣里和布鞋底，收回的旧鞋胶底制成再生胶。部队改造成功的节煤炉灶在全军推广使用后，使用煤标准由每人每天一斤半降低到一斤。人民战士无时无刻不珍惜着祖国人民的一枪一弹、一针一线。
    观众们怀着崇高的敬意看到毛主席和人民解放军战士一起劳动在十三陵水库工地上的照片，和毛主席用过的“光荣锨”。同时，我们还看到大量的图片和实物表明，从烈日炎炎的海南岛到严寒的“北大荒”，从天山南北、康藏高原到福建前线，哪里有人民子弟兵，哪里就出现了穿军装的劳动大军。新疆生产建设兵团十年如一日，用自己的汗水灌溉了干涸的戈壁，把它变成了祖国西北边疆的“粮仓”和
  “棉库”。终年战斗在崇山峻岭的铁道兵，日夜
  “移山填海”、架桥筑路，把社会主义列车引向四面八方。在人民公社富饶的田野上，在水库工地和大办钢铁的前线……广大的人民解放军官兵和人民群众一起，亲密无间，英勇奋战，成为建设战线上的模范。人民称道：“老红军回来了！”“老八路回来了！”
    广大群众参观军事博物馆以后，都说，这是一座最丰富最生动的革命传统教育大学。（附图片）
    红军在长征途中历经了千辛万苦，他们在长征途中曾经食用这样的野菜充饥。　　　　　　　　　新华社稿
