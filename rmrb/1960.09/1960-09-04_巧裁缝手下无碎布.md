    "Look, look! Master Zhuang is racking his brains again."
    "Quiet, quiet!"
    Late at night, two apprentices from the Nanping Sewing Factory in Fujian Province were peering through the window. They saw the old tailor, Zhuang Wenjin, with an old newspaper and a copy of "New Cutting Methods" spread out in front of him. He would rest his chin in his hand, deep in thought, then sketch on the paper, and then snip away with his scissors. Suddenly, he slapped his thigh and stood up, exclaiming, "Patch that triangular scrap over there! Add a seam, and we can save another three inches!" Hearing the noise outside the window, he knew it was his apprentices seeking his help again. He happily called out, "Why aren't you coming in!" The apprentices, worried about the late hour, urged the master to rest. But Master Zhuang wouldn't hear of it, so the three of them gathered together again to study the cutting.

    That's the kind of person Master Zhuang is. To save cotton cloth for the country, and to be economical for the customers, whether it's a cold night or a scorching noon, when others are resting, he's always racking his brains studying cutting methods. Master Zhuang often says, "Saving an inch of cloth for the country is ten times happier than wearing new clothes myself!"

    Whenever workers and farmers come to have clothes made, he always greets them with a smiling face, trying to make the clothes fit well. This spirit of wholeheartedly serving the customers has earned him universal praise. But some people disagree with his insistence on not wasting even an inch of cloth, saying, "Customers have money to make clothes, do they really care about those three or four inch scraps? Is it worth all that brain work!"

    "Three or four inch scraps!" Master Zhuang said slowly. "In the past, only the rich could afford good clothes, but it's different now. All six hundred and fifty million people in the country are wearing new clothes. If we save three or four inches on each garment, think how much cloth that will save!"

    The comrades at the sewing factory and the customers all say, "Master Zhuang measures for clothes even more carefully than a doctor examines a patient!" Indeed, it's true. When customers come to have clothes made, he always asks their age first. People might wonder, what does making clothes have to do with age? It does! He says that young people of seventeen or eighteen are like sugarcane after the White Dew season, growing taller every night, so their clothes should be made wider and longer. But people in their thirties and forties are like spring radishes and autumn melons, they won't grow any taller. He also patiently introduces different styles of clothes to the customers, explaining ways to save cotton cloth.

    One day, as a gentle rain was falling, Master Zhuang was cutting clothes when a young man burst in, saying he wanted to have clothes made. Seeing the young man's eagerness, Master Zhuang quickly grabbed a ruler to measure his height and chest width, examining the thickness of his neck and the size of his wrist, comparing and assessing everything carefully. The young man became impatient and said irritably, "What are you doing! This is so troublesome!"

    "Troublesome?" Master Zhuang raised his eyebrows and stared at him. "I just like to give you trouble!"

    The young man realized his attitude was wrong and quickly apologized, saying, "Just measure me! I usually use eight and a half feet, that's about right!"

    "Eight and a half feet? How wide is the fabric?" Master Zhuang asked.

    "Maybe two feet three inches!" The young man remembered clearly.

    "What about shrinkage?" Master Zhuang asked patiently again. "Well, I'm not sure, so it's better to cut a bit extra, nine feet should be enough." After hearing this, Master Zhuang patted him on the shoulder and said, "Comrade, you're very generous! You might not care about cutting an inch and a half extra, but there are six hundred and fifty million people in the country! That's no small amount!" Master Zhuang never forgot the six hundred million people, even over an inch and a half of cloth. What a dazzling communist ideology shone from this old tailor!

    One day, a middle-aged man of average height brought fifteen feet of cloth, asking him to cut a suit. Master Zhuang thought that if he cut it according to the customer's wishes, he would undoubtedly waste cloth. Could he make an extra garment? But he wasn't sure. He measured the customer's figure, worked his abacus, and even used old newspapers as patterns, drawing and tearing, tearing and drawing. After calculating for a long time, he ended up making one suit and two pairs of trousers. The customer had originally been afraid that saving cloth would mean the clothes wouldn't fit, but when he tried them on, they were just right in length and width. He was so happy that he kept calling him a skilled tailor. If he cut the cloth too short, Master Zhuang would find scraps to patch it up. If he cut too much, he would tell you not to cut the lining fabric and use the scraps for that. In order to save an inch or two of cloth, he would often rather give up his rest time and sew several extra seams.

    Using an inch and a half more or less of cloth for a garment or a pair of trousers was indeed a big deal in Master Zhuang's eyes. Not to mention the distant past, in the past year alone, Master Zhuang has saved the country more than one thousand eight hundred and seventy feet of cotton cloth by researching and promoting new cutting methods and doing everything possible to save cloth. People say Master Zhuang is a skilled tailor, and that's absolutely true.

    巧裁缝手下无碎布苏骏声
    “你看，你看啊！庄师傅又在动脑筋了。”
    “别吵，别吵！”
    深夜，福建省南平缝纫厂的两位徒工，趴在窗口往里看，只见老裁缝庄文锦面前铺着一张旧报纸和一本《新法裁剪法》，一会托腮沉思，一会拿笔在纸上画，一会又拿起剪刀嚓嚓地剪。忽然，他猛地一拍大腿站起来说：“把那块三角碎布补过来，加一条缝，又能节约三寸！”当他听到窗外的响声，料定又是徒弟找他解决难题了，就高兴地喊：“还不快进来！”徒弟们怕时间太迟了，就劝师傅早点休息。可是庄师傅哪里肯，于是师徒三人又围在一起研究起剪裁来了。
    庄师傅就是这样一个人。为了给国家节约棉布，为了给顾客精打细算，无论是严寒的深夜，或是酷暑的中午，当别人休息的时候，他总是绞尽脑汁在研究裁剪法。庄师傅常常对人说：“能为国家节约一寸布，比自己穿上新衣还乐十倍！”
    每当工人、农民络绎不绝地来作衣服时，他总是满脸堆笑地迎接他们，想法把衣服作得合身。他这种热心为顾客服务的精神，受到顾客们普遍的赞扬。但是对他这种寸布不让的精神，也有人不以为然地说：“顾客有钱作衣服，还在乎那三、四寸碎布头吗？值得那么伤脑筋！”
    “三四寸碎布头！”庄师傅慢悠悠地说：“过去能穿得上好衣服的都是有钱人，现在不同了。全国六亿五千万人民，大家都穿新衣服，一件衣服节约三四寸，这要节省多少布啊！”
    缝纫厂的同志和顾客都这么说：“庄师傅量体裁衣，比医生检查病还认真十倍！”的确不错。顾客来作衣服，他总是先问年龄。人们也许奇怪，作衣服和年龄有什么关系呢？有！他说十七、八岁的青年人就像白露后的甘蔗，一夜一节的长，衣服就要作得宽些长些。打春的萝卜，立秋的瓜，三、四十的人不会再高大。他还耐心地给顾客介绍衣服的样式，讲明节约棉布的办法。
    一天，细雨慢悠悠地下着，庄师傅正在剪衣服，猛地从外面闯进一个小青年，开口就说作衣服。看那架势，庄师傅料定是急的，就赶忙拿尺给他量体高、比胸宽，看他的脖子多粗，又握握他的手腕大小，比了又比，相了又相。青年人不耐烦了，急躁地说：“这是做什么啊！真麻烦死啦！”
    “麻烦？”庄师傅两条眉毛一耸，盯着他问：“我就喜欢找你麻烦啊！”
    青年人感到自己态度不好，连忙抱歉地说：“量量算啦，我过去都是用八尺半，差不离！”
    “八尺半？多宽的布面？”庄师傅问。
    “也许是二尺三吧！”青年倒记得很清楚。
    “缩水情况呢？”庄师傅又不厌其烦地问。“这，这倒不清楚了，那就宁可多剪些吧，九尺总够。”庄师傅听完一拍他的肩膀：“同志，你倒是个大方人！你多剪一寸半寸布不见得怎么样，可是全国有六亿五千万人啊！这就是一个不小的数目啊！”庄师傅为一寸半寸布的问题，也不忘六亿人民。在这位老裁缝的身上闪耀着多么耀眼的共产主义思想光辉啊！
    一天，一个中身材的老人，拿来一丈五尺布，叫他剪一套衣服。庄师傅想，如果按着顾客的意思剪，毫无疑问要浪费布，多剪一件能不能行呢？可是心中没有底。他一会量量顾客的身材，一会拨拨算盘，还拿来旧报纸当样本，画了撕，撕了画。这样算了半天，结果作了一件衣服和两条长裤。这位顾客原先怕节约了布穿着不合身，可是一穿不长不短，不宽不窄正合适。高兴得直叫他是巧裁缝。人家剪布剪得短了，庄师傅想办法找到碎布给他补上。也有人剪得多了些，他就叫你不要剪套布，把碎布用来做套布。为了节约一二寸布，他常常宁可挤掉休息时间，多缝好几道缝线。
    做一件衣服，一条裤子，多用或少用一寸半寸布，这在庄师傅看来的确是件大事。远的不说，光是在最近一年里，庄师傅由于研究推广新法剪裁和想尽一切办法节约布，就为国家节约棉布一千八百七十多尺。人们说庄师傅是巧裁缝，真是一点也不错。
