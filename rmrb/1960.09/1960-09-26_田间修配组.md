United in Heart to Serve the "Three Autumns"

　　Field Repair Group
To support the "Three Autumns" campaign, the factories of Shuangmiao Commune in Jiahe County, Hebei Province, dispatched more than seventy employees to form twenty-five repair groups, which went to the production teams to repair "Three Autumns" tools.

These repair groups went to the production teams, participating in labor while repairing agricultural machinery. They repaired what needed to be repaired promptly, and added what needed to be added immediately, which the commune members found very convenient. The three employees who went to the Beibali Production Team moved the red furnace to the high-yield area, repairing tools whenever they broke. Once, to rush the repair of a milling head, the three of them worked hard until 3:00 a.m. When the commune members went to work in the fields the next day, the milling was already repaired. The repair group that went to the Wulidian Production Team labored alongside the commune members in the fields. Suddenly, the double-shared plow being used to plow the wheat field broke, and the repair group hurried to repair it. By the time the commune members had finished smoking a pipe and were ready to plow again, the double-shared plow was as good as new.

In just seven days since the repair groups went down, they had repaired forty-six large carts and three hundred and twenty-five small carts, and also installed more than two thousand seven hundred pieces of small farm tools such as sickles. Seeing that the repair groups had repaired all kinds of farm tools so well in such a short period of time, the commune members were even more motivated to work.

专栏：齐心为“三秋”

　　田间修配组
    为了支援“三秋”，河北交河县双庙公社各工厂抽出了七十多名职工，组成了二十五个修配小组，分头到生产队修配“三秋”工具。
    这些修配小组到了生产队，一边参加劳动，一边修理农业机械。需要修的及时修，需要添的马上添，社员感到很方便。到北八里生产队去的三名职工，把红炉搬到丰产方里，什么时候工具坏了什么时候就修。有一次，为了赶修铣头，三个人一直奋战到深夜三点钟。第二天社员下地作活时，铣都修好了。到五里店生产队去的修配小组，和社员一起下地劳动，忽然耕麦地的双铧犁坏了，修配小组就赶忙修理。等社员吸了袋烟起来耕地时，双铧犁又像原来一样好用了。
    各修配小组下去了才七天，就修了大车四十六辆、小车三百二十五辆，还安装了镰刀等小农具两千七百多件。社员们见修配小组在很短时间内把各样农具都修得好好的，干活的劲头更大了。
