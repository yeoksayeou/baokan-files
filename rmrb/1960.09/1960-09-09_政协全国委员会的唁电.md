Telegram of Condolence from the National Committee of the CPPCC

To the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany:

We are deeply saddened to learn of the unfortunate passing of President Wilhelm Pieck on September 7th. With immense grief, we extend our deepest condolences to you and the German people. President Wilhelm Pieck's life of struggle was closely linked with the fight against imperialism and the cause of world peace and socialism. His death represents the loss of an outstanding fighter for the proletariat worldwide.

President Wilhelm Pieck was a close friend of the Chinese people. He tirelessly dedicated himself to strengthening and consolidating the fraternal friendship and friendly cooperation between the people of China and Germany, which makes us feel all the more infinitely saddened by his passing. In the future, the Chinese people will further consolidate and develop their fraternal friendship with the German people, and together with the German people, continue to oppose the aggression and war policies of the imperialist camp headed by the United States, oppose the revival of fascism in West Germany, consolidate the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and push the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism towards new victories.

President Wilhelm Pieck will live forever!

                National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, September 8, 1960

    政协全国委员会的唁电民主德国全国阵线全国委员会：
    惊悉威廉·皮克总统于9月7日不幸逝世，我们以万分沉痛的心情向你们和德意志人民致以深切的哀悼。威廉·皮克总统战斗的一生同反对帝国主义、争取世界和平和社会主义事业紧紧地联接在一起。他的逝世使全世界无产阶级失去了一位卓越的战士。
    威廉·皮克总统是中国人民亲密的朋友。他曾经不懈地致力于加强和巩固中德两国人民间的兄弟友谊和友好合作，这更加使我们对他的逝世感到无限悲痛。今后，中国人民将进一步巩固和发展同德国人民的兄弟友谊，同德国人民一道继续反对以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的侵略和战争政策，反对在西德复活法西斯主义，巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，把和平、民主和社会主义事业推向新的胜利。
    威廉·皮克总统永垂不朽！
                中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会　1960年9月8日
