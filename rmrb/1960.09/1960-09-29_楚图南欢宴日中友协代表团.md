Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, hosted a luncheon today to welcome the delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association headed by Shinichiro Omori.

　　At the banquet, Chu Tunan warmly praised the Japan-China Friendship Association for its great contributions to enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, and expressed his respect and gratitude to the Japanese friends. He said: "The brilliant victory of the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle has dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war, encouraged the people of the world to oppose imperialism and colonialism, and made great contributions to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world."

　　Chu Tunan said: "The Japanese people have closely combined the movement for Japan-China friendship and the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China with the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The Chinese people have also launched a massive movement to firmly support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the United States. The friendship between the two peoples has been constantly consolidated and developed in the struggle against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism."

　　Chu Tunan said: "We highly cherish this fighting friendship between us, which is unshakable. The Japanese people can believe that in the future struggle against the enemy of the people of the world—U.S. imperialism—the Chinese people will always be the Japanese people's loyal and reliable comrades-in-arms."

　　Shinichiro Omori said in his speech that as the Chinese people celebrate the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and continue to advance with epoch-making steps in the great socialist construction and the struggle to safeguard world peace, we, on behalf of the Japan-China Friendship Association, express our heartfelt congratulations. He said: "We will promote the Japan-China friendship movement; based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit, we will fight to crush all policies of U.S. imperialism and its follower, the Japanese reactionary forces, that are hostile to China, create 'two Chinas,' and hinder the normalization of Japan-China relations, and to realize the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations.

　　Shinichiro Omori said: "The Japanese people have launched a nationwide struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, which is aimed at aggression against China, the Soviet Union, and other Asian countries." He thanked the Chinese people for their firm support of this struggle. He also said: "We have overthrown the Nobusuke Kishi regime, the faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism, who sold out his own nation to the enemy. However, U.S. imperialism has not relaxed its control over Japan at all. Ignoring the Japanese people's strong calls for not recognizing the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, they are forcibly implementing this treaty and suppressing and deceiving the Japanese people, but the peace-loving Japanese people will never recognize this treaty."

　　He said: "We, the Japanese people, will broadly form a national united front and fight to the end to break the 'security guarantee' system and abolish the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. Our struggle must continue until U.S. imperialism is driven out of Japan and out of Asia. We are convinced that this national aspiration will be achieved." He also said: "The Japanese people oppose the plunder of Japan by U.S. monopoly capital under the guise of Japan-U.S. economic cooperation, oppose nuclear armament, demand the abolition of military bases, and the recovery of Okinawa Island, the U.S. imperialist's base of aggression in Asia, and fight to safeguard peace in Asia and the world."

　　Attending today's banquet were Yang Hansheng and Ding Xilin, Vice Presidents of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Zhou Erfu, Secretary General, Lin Lin, Deputy Secretary General, as well as Zhao Puchu, Shen Zijiu, Zhao Anbo, Xie Nanguang, Yang Zheng, Yang Chunsong, Wang Geng, Peng Yan, and Ding Tuo, and other relevant figures from various fields.

　　Koichi Saionji, a Japanese peace advocate in Beijing, Isaya Senda, Deputy Head of the Japanese Drama Troupe, and Hwang Bong-koo, a Korean peace advocate in Beijing, were also invited to attend the banquet.

　　Before the banquet, Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Vice Presidents Yang Hansheng and Ding Xilin met with all members of the delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association and had a cordial conversation.

　　楚图南欢宴日中友协代表团
    新华社28日讯　中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南今天中午设宴欢迎大森真一郎为首的日中友好协会访华代表团全体成员。
    楚图南在宴会上热烈赞扬日中友好协会为增进中日两国人民的相互了解和友谊作出了很大贡献，并对日本朋友表示敬意和感谢。他说：“日本人民的爱国正义斗争所取得的辉煌胜利，给了美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策严重打击，鼓舞了全世界人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义的斗争，为保卫亚洲和世界和平作出了巨大贡献。”
    楚图南说：“日本人民把日中友好、日中恢复邦交运动和反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争紧密结合了起来。中国人民也为坚决支持日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争，掀起了巨大规模的运动。两国人民的友谊，在反对我们共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中不断获得巩固发展”。
    楚图南说：“我们十分珍视我们之间的这种战斗友谊，它是不可动摇的。日本人民可以相信，在今后反对全世界人民的敌人——美帝国主义的斗争中，中国人民将永远是日本人民忠实可靠的战友”。
    大森真一郎在讲话中说，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在伟大的社会主义建设和保卫世界和平的斗争中以划时代的步伐继续前进的情况下，庆祝中华人民共和国成立十一周年，我们代表日中友好协会表示衷心祝贺。他说：“我们要促进日中友好运动；根据和平共处五项原则和万隆精神，为粉碎美帝国主义及其追随者日本反动势力敌视中国、制造‘两个中国’、妨碍日中关系正常化的一切政策，实现恢复日中邦交而斗争。
    大森真一郎说：“日本人民为反对针对中国、苏联和亚洲各国的，以侵略为企图的日美军事同盟条约，掀起了全民性的斗争”。他感谢中国人民对这一斗争给予的坚决支持。他还说：“我们打倒了美帝国主义忠实走狗、把自己的民族贩卖给敌人的岸信介政权。可是美帝国主义在日本的统治绝没有放松。他们无视日本人民不承认日美军事同盟条约的强有力的呼声，正在强迫执行这一条约，并对日本人民进行镇压、欺骗，但是爱好和平的日本人民绝对不会承认这个条约的”。
    他说：“我们日本人民广泛地结成民族统一战线，为打碎‘安全保障’体制，废除日美军事同盟条约而斗争到底。我们的斗争必须进行到把美帝国主义从日本、从亚洲赶出去为止，我们确信，这一民族的愿望一定会达到”。他还说：“日本人民反对在日美经济合作的幌子下的美国垄断资本对日本的掠夺，反对核武装，要求废除军事基地，夺回美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略据点冲绳岛，并且为保卫亚洲和世界和平而斗争”。
    出席今天宴会的，有中国人民对外文化协会副会长阳翰笙、丁西林、秘书长周而复、副秘书长林林，以及各方面有关人士赵朴初、沈兹九、赵安博、谢南光、杨正，杨春松、王耕、彭炎、丁拓等。
    日本在京和平人士西园寺公一，日本话剧团副团长千田是也，朝鲜在京和平人士黄凤九也应邀出席了宴会。
