American Farmers' Impoverishment
        The People Without Rights
    "From Florida, Texas, and southern California to the roads of the North, dirty, covered trucks rumble along. They carry half a million agricultural workers who have lost their land and have no settled lives. These workers harvest most of the nation's food, but until now, they have been people without rights, like 'the expelled' from the American nation, because the laws that guarantee a minimum wage to everyone else have not been extended to them." This is the "New York Times'" description of the current plight of American agricultural workers.
    There are approximately four million agricultural workers in the United States, about two million of whom are employed in agricultural labor for only about twenty-five days a year. They are the most insecure class of residents, known as "migrant workers." In 1957, their daily wage was only 29% of the daily wage of industrial workers. Among these "migrant" agricultural workers, about one-third are Black, and another half a million are seasonal workers from countries like Mexico. Their wages are even lower.
    Agricultural workers without fixed residences live a life of displacement. Early in the morning, they wander the streets looking for job opportunities. If they happen to encounter a farmer hiring temporary workers, they have a day's work. But they must deduct the fare for the farmer's truck that transports them to and from the city and the farm from their wages. The distance between the farm and the city can sometimes be as far as forty or fifty miles. The round-trip fare often amounts to as much as $1.50. And temporary cotton pickers must also pay 25 cents to purchase bags supplied by the farmer.
    During the busy agricultural season in California, the number of hired agricultural workers reaches a maximum of more than 400,000. The head of the California Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee once appealed to the California State Legislature, saying:
    "Agricultural workers do not enjoy equality under the law. They are virtually an untouchable class. They labor under a completely different and inferior standard than industrial workers. Agricultural workers are deprived of dignity. This is not because of something they did or did not do. They are deprived of dignity because the occupation they engage in is an occupation that is excluded from dignity in society."
    In the logging yards of the southern United States and in some cotton plantations in the South and Southwest, there are still agricultural workers who are paying off debts through labor. Capitalists force their employees to buy food and daily necessities at high prices in stores they own. Employees fall into debt. The inescapable debt makes them "slaves" paying off debts through labor.
    An agricultural worker in Florida who was forced to perform slave labor said, "They've pushed us to the end of the road. Some of the older people tell me that the only way out is death!"
        The Misfortune of Ruin
    Not only are agricultural workers struggling on the verge of death, but small and medium-sized farmers in the United States are also in unprecedented misfortune. More and more farmers are being ruined, leaving their homes and fleeing to the cities to find work.
    According to official American materials, in 1954, the agricultural population of the United States accounted for 18% of the total population, 13% in 1955, 12% in 1958, and has now fallen to 9%. The reduction in the agricultural population is the result of agricultural monopolies increasingly consolidating and merging small and medium-sized farmers. In the thirteen years from 1945 to 1958, the number of "independently operated" farms in the United States decreased by 1.2 million, equivalent to one-fifth of all farms. More than four million people have left the countryside because they could not maintain their livelihoods.
    In 1959, the number of farm auctions in the "agricultural belt" of fifteen states surged. Farmers auctioned off machines, tools, and livestock, leaving their hometowns to seek a living in the cities and on the west coast. According to surveys, the number of farms auctioned in the winter of 1959 increased by 50% compared to the same period in 1958.
    The concentration of land, the exclusion and annexation of small and medium-sized farmers by agricultural capitalists, and the establishment of monopolistic low prices for agricultural products by agricultural monopoly organizations, while setting monopolistic high prices for their own products, thereby obtaining most of the value created by agriculture, all contribute to the bankruptcy of small and medium-sized farmers. According to statistics in the American press, the big landlords and agricultural capitalists, who account for only 2.8% of the American rural population, account for as much as 31.3% of the total farm products sold annually in the United States, while the poor farmers and some middle peasants, who account for 56% of the rural population, account for only 9%.
    American bourgeois politicians and various bourgeois groups are also vigorously advocating the elimination of small and medium-sized farmers. American Secretary of Agriculture Benson has always firmly advocated abolishing all subsidies and other assistance to farmers due to low agricultural product prices. He advocates squeezing "inefficient" farms out of production. The US Chamber of Commerce publication "Nation's Business" recently published an article clamoring to reduce the number of American farms from the current four million to one million.
      Lost Hope for the Future
    The agricultural crisis has caused American farmers to be saddled with debt. In 1945, the total debt of American farmers was $7.6 billion. In 1960, it increased to $22.6 billion, a threefold increase. In 1959 alone, American farmers' debt increased by $1.8 billion.
    For sixteen years, the American government has been continuously increasing taxes on cultivated land. Agricultural income in 1958 was roughly equivalent to that in 1950, but the American government's tax on each acre of cultivated land increased by about 50%. This further accelerated the bankruptcy of farmers.
    Due to the continuous rise in production costs and living expenses, and the continued decline in agricultural product prices, American farmers' incomes have been greatly reduced. In 1959, American farmers' income decreased by 16% compared to 1958, and in the first quarter of 1960, it decreased by another 23% compared to the same period in 1959.
  "U.S. News & World Report" magazine said that although the average income of each American farmer is nominally 13% higher than in 1949, the cost of living has risen by 25% during this period.
    The agricultural crisis has brought profound disasters to American farmers. Now, even American officials and political figures no longer conceal the impoverishment and miserable living conditions of American farmers.
    The "Congressional Record" of March 17, 1960, page A2406, quoted a statement by Missouri Farmers Association President Hainki describing the situation of farmers, saying: "Many farmers are facing bankruptcy. Other farmers have or are trying to find non-agricultural jobs... Many rural women are also forced to find work in the city... As the economic crisis sweeping across rural America deepens, not only farmers, but also many small businessmen and rural communities who directly rely on agricultural income have lost hope for the future."

### 美国农民的贫困化

    美国农民的贫困化
        没有权利的人们
    “从佛罗里达州、得克萨斯州和加利福尼亚州南部到北方的道路上，肮脏的带篷的大货车辘辘地在作响。它们载着五十万失去了土地、没有定居生活的农业工人。这些工人为国家收获了大部分粮食，但是直到现在，他们还是没有权利的人，就像是美利坚民族中‘被开除的人’一样，因为保证所有其他的人能得到最低工资的法律，还没有推行到他们身上”。这是“纽约时报”对美国农业工人当前处境的描写。
    在美国约有四百万名农业工人，其中约二百万人每年受雇从事农业劳动只有二十五天左右。他们是生活最没有保障的居民阶层，被称为“流动工人”。他们每天的工资，在1957年只占产业工人每天工资的29％。这些“流动的”农业工人中，大约有三分之一是黑人，还有五十万名是来自墨西哥等国的季节工。他们的工资就更低。
    没有定居的农业工人，过着流离失所的生活。一清早，他们就在街头徘徊寻找工作机会。如果碰上农场主招雇临时工，他们就有一天的工作机会。可是他们必须从工资中扣除乘坐农场主的往返城市与农场之间的货车的车费。农场与城市的距离有时达四、五十哩之遥。往返的车费往往高达美金一元五角之多。而拣棉花的临时工人还要出二角五分钱购买农场主供给的布袋。
    在加利福尼亚州的农忙季节里，受雇佣的农业工人，最多时达到四十多万名。加利福尼亚的农业工人组织委员会的负责人曾经向加利福尼亚州州议会呼吁说：
    “农业工人没有享受法律的平等。他们实际上是不可接触的阶级。他们在一套与产业工人完全不同的、低劣的标准之下进行劳动。农业工人被剥夺了尊严。这并不是因为他们做了什么事或是没有做什么事。他们被剥夺了尊严，是由于他们所从事的职业在社会上是被排斥于尊严之外的职业。”
    在美国南部的伐木场和南部及西南部的一些棉花种植园里，还存在着用劳役偿债的农业工人。资本家强迫雇工以高价在他所开设的商店里购买食物和日用必需品。雇工陷入了负债的地位。永远摆脱不了的债务，使他们成了以劳役偿债的“奴隶”。
    佛罗里达州一个被迫进行奴隶劳动的农业工人说：“他们把我们逼得山穷水尽。一些年纪大的人告诉我，唯一的出路就是死亡！”
        倾家荡产的厄运
    不仅是农业工人挣扎在死亡线上，美国的中小农户也正处于空前的厄运中。愈来愈多的农民倾家荡产、离乡背井流入城市寻找工作。
    根据美国官方材料，1954年美国农业人口占总人口的18％，1955年为13％，1958年为12％，现已降为9％。农业人口的缩减，是农业垄断组织日益加强兼并中小农户的结果。从1945年到1958年的十三年里，美国“独立经营”的农场已经减少了一百二十万个，相当于全部农场数目的五分之一。由于无法维持生活而离开农村的人达四百多万名。
    1959年，“农业地带”十五个州的农场拍卖的数目激增。农户拍卖机器、工具和牲畜，离开故乡到城市和西部海岸去谋生。据调查，1959年冬季拍卖的农场数目比1958年同期增多了50％。
    土地的集中，农业资本家对中小农的排挤、吞并，农业垄断组织对农产品规定垄断低价，而对自己生产的商品又规定垄断高价从而获取了大部分农业所创造的价值、这一切促使中小农破产。据美国报刊的统计，只占美国农村人口2.8％的大地主和农业资本家，在美国全部农场每年出售的产品中，所占的比重高达31.3％，而占农村人口56％的贫农和一部分中农所占的分额只有9％。
    美国资产阶级政客和形形色色的资产阶级团体，还在大力鼓吹消灭中小农户。美国农业部长本逊，一向坚决主张废除由于农产品价格低而给予农民的一切津贴和其他援助。他赞成把“生产效率低”的农场从生产中排挤出去。美国商会刊物“全国商业”不久以前还发表文章，叫嚷要把美国农场的数目从目前的四百万个减少到一百万个。
      失去了对未来的希望
    农业危机造成美国农民的债台高筑。1945年，美国农民的负债总额是七十六亿美元。而1960年竟增加到二百二十六亿美元，即增为三倍。1959年一年间，美国农民的债务增加了十八亿美元。
    十六年以来，美国政府对耕地的征税不断地增加。1958年的农业收入与1950年的大约相当，可是美国政府对每英亩耕地的征税却增加了50％左右。这就进一步加速了农民的破产。
    由于生产成本和生活费用的不断上涨、农产品价格的继续下跌，美国农民的收入大大减少。1959年，美国农民的收入比1958年减少了16％，而1960年第一季度又比1959年同期下降了23％。
  “美国新闻与世界报道”杂志说，目前虽然平均每个美国农民的收入在名义上比1949年高13％，但是生活费用在这一期间却上涨了25％。
    农业危机给美国农民带来了深重无比的灾难。现在，连美国官方和政治人物都不再隐瞒美国农民的贫困化和生活的悲惨处境了。
    美国“国会记录”1960年3月17日第A二千四百零六页，摘引美国密苏里州农民协会主席海恩基描绘农民情况的一段谈话说：“许多农民正在面临破产。另外一些农民已经或正在设法寻找非农业的工作……许多农村妇女也被迫去寻找城市的工作……随着遍及美国农村的经济危机的日益加深，不仅农民，就连直接依靠农业收入过活的许多小商人和农村团体都失去了对于未来的希望。”　（乐山）
