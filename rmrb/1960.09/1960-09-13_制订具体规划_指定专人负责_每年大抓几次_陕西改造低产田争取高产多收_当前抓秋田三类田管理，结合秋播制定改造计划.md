    Shaanxi Transforms Low-Yield Fields to Strive for High Yields and Increased Harvests
    Currently Focus on Management of Third-Category Autumn Fields, Combine with Autumn Planting to Formulate Renovation Plans
    (Our newspaper, Xi'an, 12th Dispatch) The broad masses of commune members in the rural people's communes of Shaanxi Province are carrying out a movement to transform low-yield fields, striving for high yields and increased harvests of autumn crops.

    At present, the central task of transforming low-yield fields is to focus on the management of third-category autumn fields. In the movement to transform third-category autumn fields, various localities have adopted different measures based on the different causes of low-yield fields. The third-category autumn fields in Wangqu Commune, Chang'an County, were all caused by being far from the village and not being managed in a timely manner; therefore, each production team established production points in the remote autumn fields, implementing labor, eating, resting, and livestock pens at the fields, completing the weeding, thinning, soil cultivation, and fertilization of the remote autumn fields in a timely manner, changing the face of the remote third-category autumn fields. The Shangluo Prefectural Committee organized more than 20,000 cadres from the special district, county, commune, and production team levels, leading more than 340,000 commune members to transform the autumn fields on remote mountain slopes and steep slopes. Based on the characteristics of the inconvenience of transporting fertilizer on slopes, they moved large numbers of pig pens and sheep pens to the mountains, building large numbers of compost pools and smoked fertilizer pits in the slopes, and some even built local chemical fertilizer plants on the mountains, accumulating and applying fertilizer locally. According to surveys in Zhen'an and Shangxian counties, many communes have achieved one compost pool per slope plot, and the amount of fertilizer applied has more than doubled compared to previous years. In order to transform low-yield fields, the Hu County Party Committee convened a forum of production team cadres, technicians, and veteran farmers to find out the causes of low yields in local saline-alkali soil, sandy gravel land, and other fields, mobilizing the masses to "prescribe the right medicine." For example, commune members in the Dingzhou Management Area of the Dawang Commune specifically applied hot fertilizer to the alkali beach land, which is low-lying and has cool soil properties; and applied cool fertilizer to the sandy land, which has hot soil properties. By frequently applying topdressing according to different soils, the seedlings in the entire management area's more than 5,000 mu of sandy-alkali beach land quickly changed from weak to strong. Along the Great Wall in northern Shaanxi, many third-category autumn fields have been attacked by wind and sand. At present, in the movement to transform third-category autumn fields in Jingbian, Dingbian, and other counties, more than 7,600 zhang of barriers have been built to prevent wind and sand damage.

    In the spirit of focusing on both this autumn and next year, various localities have formulated plans for transforming low-yield fields in conjunction with the current autumn planting preparations. Areas lacking water will solve water conservancy problems, areas lacking fertilizer will prepare to increase fertilizer application, and areas with uneven ground and poor soil will combine deep plowing with land leveling and soil improvement. In addition, low-yield wheat varieties that are not suitable for local planting will be replaced with high-yielding, high-quality varieties suitable for local planting.

    In the movement to transform low-yield fields, various localities have widely summarized and applied past experiences. For example, after the summer harvest this year, Dali County and various communes generally held on-site meetings on the transformation of low-yield fields, summarizing the experiences of transforming sandy land, loess land, and steep slopes over the past few years, and immediately took action. At present, 30,000 mu of low-yield fields have been transformed (excluding the 70,000 mu that have been transformed over the years), and the preliminary transformation of another 100,000 mu of low-yield fields will be completed before autumn planting. The Bayu Brigade of the Qiangbai Commune in this county has 5,000 mu of low-yield fields, some of which are coarse yellow sandy land and some of which are loess land. Ma Qinghai, a national labor model and production brigade leader, led 500 people into the sand to establish a production point, pulling loess to press the sand and pulling sand to cover the loess, covering the sandy soil with a layer of loess to transform the loose nature of the sandy soil and improve fertility. According to experience, after covering each mu of sandy land with ten large carts of loess, the wheat yield per mu can be increased from the original forty jin to two hundred jin. They also mixed loess with fertilizer and used it as base fertilizer for wheat fields. While pressing the sand with loess, they used carts to pull sand to cover the loess in return, in order to reconcile the viscosity of the loess soil and promote the formation of aggregate structure. At the same time, the loess land was generally deeply plowed about eight inches, with fertilizer applied in layers to promote soil ripening and deepen the cultivated layer. The county has established 50,000 mu of high-yield fields and 10,000 mu of demonstration plots in low-yield fields.

    Low-yield fields in Shaanxi Province account for about 40% of the cultivated land area. These low-yield fields are either poor in soil or frequently drought-stricken, resulting in very low yields, which seriously affects the total grain output of the province. Therefore, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has always attached great importance to the work of transforming low-yield fields, regarding it as a major measure to develop grain production. Recently, the Provincial Party Committee instructed Party committees at all levels to further strengthen their leadership over the transformation of low-yield fields, requiring Party committees at all levels to assign dedicated personnel to be responsible, formulate specific plans, and focus on several campaigns each year, and requiring all departments to make supporting the transformation of low-yield areas a key point in supporting agriculture.

    陕西改造低产田争取高产多收
    当前抓秋田三类田管理，结合秋播制定改造计划
    本报西安12日电　陕西农村各人民公社广大社员，开展改造低产田的运动，争取秋作物高产多收。
    目前，改造低产田的中心工作是抓三类秋田的管理。各地在改造三类秋田的运动中，针对形成低产田的不同原因，采取了不同的措施。长安县王曲公社的三类秋田都是离村较远，管理不及时所造成的；因此各生产队就在边远的秋田里，普遍建立了生产点，实行劳动、吃饭、休息、牲畜圈到田，及时完成了对边远秋田的除草、间苗、培土、施肥等管理工作，使边远的三类秋田改变了面貌。商雒地委组织了专区、县、公社和生产队的干部共二万多人，率领三十四万多名社员，改造远山坡地陡坡地的秋田。他们根据坡地运肥不便的特点，把大批的猪圈、羊圈搬上山，在坡地里大量修沤肥池和熏肥坑，有的还在山上修建了土化肥厂，就地积造，就地施肥。据镇安、商县调查，已有许多公社实现了一块坡地一个沤肥池，施肥量较往年增加了一倍以上。鄠县县委为了改造低产田，召开生产队干部、技术员、老农座谈会，找出了当地沙碱土、沙石地等田的低产原因，发动群众“对症下药”。如大王公社定舟管理区社员针对碱滩地低潮、土性凉的特点，专门施热性肥；沙地土性热，就施凉性肥。这样按不同土壤勤施追肥，很快就使全管理区五千多亩沙碱滩地的禾苗由弱变强。陕北长城沿线，很多三类秋田遭风沙袭击，目前，靖边、定边等县在改造三类秋田的运动中，搭起了七千六百多丈障蔽，防止风沙为害。
    各地本着一手抓今秋，一手抓明年的精神，结合当前的秋播准备工作，制定了改造低产田的计划。缺水的地区就解决水利问题，缺肥的地区就准备增施肥料，地不平的和土壤不良的，就结合深翻地平整土地，改良土壤。并且把那些不适宜当地种植的低产的小麦品种，调换适宜当地种植的产量高的优良品种。
    在改造低产田运动中，各地普遍总结和运用了过去的经验。如大荔县在今年夏收以后，县和各公社就普遍召开了改造低产田的现场会议，总结了几年来改造沙地、垆土地和陡坡地的经验，并且立即行动，目前已改造好三万亩（历年已改造过的七万亩在外）低产田，秋播前将再完成十万亩低产田的初步改造。这个县的羌白公社八鱼大队有五千亩低产田，其中一部分是粗黄沙地，一部分是垆土地。全国劳动模范、生产大队长马清海带领五百人进沙建立了生产点，拉垆土压沙和拉沙盖垆，在沙土上盖上一层垆土，改造沙土的松散性质，提高肥力。根据经验，每亩沙地盖上十大车垆土后，小麦亩产就能由原来的四十斤提高到二百斤。他们并且把垆土与肥料混合，作为麦田的底肥。在以垆压沙的同时，回车拉沙盖垆，来调和垆土地的粘性，促使形成团粒结构。同时对垆土地普遍深翻八寸左右，分层施肥，促进土壤熟化，加深耕作层。全县已在低产田中建立了丰产方五万亩，样板田一万亩。
    陕西省低产田约占耕地面积40％。这些低产田不是土壤不良，就是经常干旱，产量很低，严重地影响着全省粮食的总产量。因此，中共陕西省委历年来都非常重视改造低产田的工作，把它作为发展粮食生产的一项重大措施。最近，省委又指示各级党委进一步加强对改造低产田的领导，要求各级党委指定专人负责，制定具体规划，每年大抓几次，并要求各个部门把支援改造低产地区工作作为支援农业的一个重点。
