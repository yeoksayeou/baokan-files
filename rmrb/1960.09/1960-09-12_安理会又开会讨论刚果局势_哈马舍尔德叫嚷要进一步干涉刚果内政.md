Xinhua News Agency, September 11th: New York dispatch: At the request of United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, the United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting in New York on the afternoon of September 9th (New York time) to discuss the situation in Congo.

　　Hammarskjöld issued his fourth report on the situation in Congo. In the report, he described the Congolese central government's struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity against the secessionist groups in Katanga Province and Kasai Province as "violating the spirit of the Security Council resolution." He remained silent about the criminal activities of the "UN forces" in actively splitting Congo under the manipulation of the United States, but instead claimed that these conflicts "have particularly serious characteristics because all parties rely on and receive some kind of external assistance."

　　Hammarskjöld was clearly uneasy about the Congolese central government's righteous action of sending troops to suppress the secessionist groups in Katanga Province and Kasai Province, etc., which were under the protection of the "UN forces" and Belgian colonialism, in order to safeguard national unity and territorial sovereignty. He viciously slandered this action as "having the nature of genocide" and "appearing to be aimed at eliminating a specific race." He brazenly clamored for "disarming the (Congolese) army," saying that these forces were "an obstacle to restoring law and order."

　　Hammarskjöld made no secret of the fact that the purpose of his vicious attack on the Congolese government was to create an excuse for the US-controlled "UN forces" to further interfere in Congo's internal affairs and the conspiracy to disarm the Congolese army that was being prepared. In his report, he clamored that the Congolese government's actions to suppress the traitorous groups obviously could not "simply be regarded as examples of domestic political conflict." He fiercely yelled, "Can't...the United Nations take action in these cases?"

　　Hammarskjöld then enthusiastically praised the recent arrogant actions taken by the American controlled “UN forces” which violated Congo's national sovereignty, such as closing Congo's radio stations and airports. He stated that although he had not been consulted in advance, he "fully agreed with this action" and was willing to "take full responsibility." Hammarskjöld also blatantly interfered in Congo's internal affairs, expressing his support for the "removal" of Prime Minister Lumumba by Congolese President Kasavubu, saying that Kasavubu had the right to do so under the constitution. And Lumumba "had no right" to dismiss the president.

　　Hammarskjöld then clamored that no matter how the domestic situation in Congo develops, "the activities of the United Nations must continue...because there is a great danger of the Congo crisis spreading to the entire African continent." He also threatened the Guinean military headquarters in Congo because it announced that it would temporarily withdraw Guinean troops from the "UN forces" in protest of the "UN forces" interfering in Congo's internal affairs. Hammarskjöld threatened that if a country's troops withdraw from the "UN forces," "they will have to be treated as foreign troops entering Congo."

　　During the meeting, the President of the Security Council for September, Italian representative Ottona, announced that he had received a telegram from Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba protesting the United Nations' interference in Congo's internal affairs. In the telegram, Lumumba demanded that the United Nations "stop all direct or indirect interference in our republic." Lumumba also requested the Security Council not to pass any more resolutions regarding Congo.

　　In another telegram, Lumumba also requested the Security Council to temporarily suspend the meeting so that the Republic of Congo could send a delegation to participate in the meeting. Lumumba's request was supported by the Soviet delegation. Soviet representative Kuznetsov pointed out that this would allow the Security Council to discuss the Congo situation more carefully and fully. Although the Western countries headed by the United States did not dare to openly express their opposition, they attempted to take the opportunity to force the Republic of Congo to accept such conditions, that is, during this period, give United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld unlimited power to interfere in Congo's internal affairs.

　　During the meeting, the President of the Security Council also announced that he had received a telegram from Congolese President Kasavubu. In the telegram, Kasavubu requested the United Nations not to cooperate with the legitimate government of Congo headed by Lumumba. Kasavubu also stated that he was willing to conduct "full and complete cooperation" with such an "international organization" as the United Nations.

　　The meeting will continue on the 12th.

### 安理会又开会讨论刚果局势  哈马舍尔德叫嚷要进一步干涉刚果内政

    安理会又开会讨论刚果局势
    哈马舍尔德叫嚷要进一步干涉刚果内政
    据新华社11日讯　纽约消息：在联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的要求下，联合国安全理事会在纽约时间9日下午举行紧急会议，讨论刚果局势问题。
    哈马舍尔德发表了关于刚果局势的第四个报告。他在报告中把刚果中央政府为维护国家主权完整而对加丹加省和开赛省的分裂集团进行的斗争说成是“违反安理会决议的精神”，他闭口不谈“联合国军”在美国操纵下积极分裂刚果的罪恶活动，却说什么这些冲突“由于各方依靠和获得外界的某种援助而具有特别严重的性质”。
    哈马舍尔德对刚果中央政府派军队去讨伐受到“联合国军”和比利时殖民主义庇护的加丹加省和开赛省等地的分裂集团以维护国家统一和领土主权完整的正义行动显然惴惴不安，他恶毒诬蔑这种行动“有种族灭绝罪行的性质”，“看来是要消灭一个具体的种族”。他悍然叫嚷“有必要解除（刚果）军队的武装”，说什么这些部队是“恢复法律和秩序的一个障碍”。
    哈马舍尔德毫不掩饰，他对刚果政府进行这种恶毒攻击的目的是在替美国所控制的“联合国军”进一步干涉刚果内政和正在准备的解除刚果军队武装的阴谋制造借口。他在报告中叫嚣，刚果政府讨伐叛国集团的行动显然不能“仅仅看作国内政治冲突的例子”。他凶恶地叫嚷说，“难道……联合国在这些事例中不能采取行动吗？”
    哈马舍尔德接着热烈地颂扬由美国控制的“联合国军”最近所采取的封闭刚果的广播电台和飞机场等侵犯刚果国家主权的蛮横行动。他表示，虽然他事先未被征求意见，但是他“完全同意这种行动”，并愿意“担当全部责任”。哈马舍尔德还露骨干涉刚果内政，他表示支持刚果总统卡萨武布所采取的“罢免”卢蒙巴总理的行动，说根据宪法卡萨武布是有这个权利的。而卢蒙巴“没有权利”罢免总统。
    哈马舍尔德接着叫嚣，不管刚果国内局势如何发展，“联合国的活动必须继续……因为存在着刚果危机蔓延到整个非洲的巨大危险”。他还威胁刚果的几内亚军司令部，因为它宣布把几内亚军队暂时从“联合国军”里撤出来以抗议“联合国军”干涉刚果内政。哈马舍尔德扬言，如果一个国家的军队脱离了“联合国军”，“他们将不得不被当做进入刚果的外国军队”。
    在会议进行过程中，安理会9月份主席、意大利代表奥托纳宣布收到刚果总理卢蒙巴打来的抗议联合国干涉刚果内政的电报。卢蒙巴在电报中要求联合国“停止一切直接或间接的对我们共和国的干涉”。卢蒙巴还要求安理会不要再通过任何关于刚果的决议。
    卢蒙巴在另外一份电报中还要求安理会暂时中止会议，以便刚果共和国能派代表团参加会议。卢蒙巴这一要求得到苏联代表团的支持。苏联代表库兹?佐夫指出，这将使安理会有可能更仔细和充分地讨论刚果局势。以美国为首的西方国家虽然不敢公然表示反对，但是他们竟企图趁机强迫刚果共和国接受这样的条件，即在这个期间里给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德以无限权利来干涉刚果的内政。
    在会议进行过程中，安理会主席还宣布收到刚果总统卡萨武布的电报。卡萨武布在电报中要求联合国不要同以卢蒙巴为首的刚果的合法政府合作。卡萨武布还表示，他愿意同联合国这样的“国际组织”进行“充分的和完全的合作”。
    会议将于12日继续举行。
