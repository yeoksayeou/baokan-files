　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th: The work of inventions and rationalization proposals in Soviet industry has made significant new progress this year.

　　In the first half of this year, compared with the same period last year, the number of inventors and rationalization proposers in the Soviet Union increased by 301,000, the number of proposals submitted increased by 436,000, and the number of accepted proposals increased by 256,000. Due to the adoption of these proposals, the country saved 1.5 billion rubles.

　　Workers in many factories directly use rationalization proposals to increase the factory's seven-year plan fund. Workers in the Sverdlovsk region decided to submit as many rationalization proposals as possible in order to complete the task of accumulating the seven-year plan fund in five years. Workers in the Kuibyshev region decided to increase the seven-year plan fund accumulation from 1.5 billion rubles to 2 billion. Many workers have also made personal plans to submit rationalization proposals. For example, worker Fomin of the New Kramatorsk Machine Factory decided to add 1.5 million rubles to the factory's seven-year plan fund by submitting rationalization proposals. Due to the implementation of the three rationalization proposals he put forward, one million rubles has already been saved.

　　Workers in various places have created many new organizational forms to promote the development of rationalization proposal work. Many places have established associations of inventors and rationalization proposers. The Saratov region's association recently inspected the implementation of rationalization proposals in twenty large factories and actively helped these factories to promote rationalization proposals in the production process. Factories and enterprises in the Sverdlovsk region have established six hundred mass design groups to promote rationalization proposals within the factories. The Fourth Bearing Factory in the Kuibyshev region established sixty-five comprehensive work teams consisting of three hundred and fifty workers, engineers, and technicians. These work teams decided to submit at least four thousand five hundred rationalization proposals during the seven-year plan period. Many regions have also held competitions, exhibitions, and other activities to promote the rationalization proposal movement.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 17th: Poland's rationalization proposal movement is developing rapidly. In the first half of this year alone, workers in various places submitted more than 42,000 new rationalization proposals. The total number of rationalization proposals submitted by Polish industrial enterprises throughout last year was more than 56,000.

　　In the first half of this year, workers in various places also newly established five hundred technical and rationalization proposal clubs to carry out activities for studying technological innovation. Now the number of technical and rationalization proposal clubs across the country has increased to more than two thousand, with 110,000 people participating in club activities, half of whom are workers.

　　In order to strengthen the leadership of the rationalization proposal movement in various places, the Central Council of Polish Trade Unions convened a Polish Rationalization Proposers Conference at the Nowa Huta Lenin Metallurgical Combine on September 12th, mobilizing workers across the country to further develop the rationalization proposal movement. At the meeting, many speakers made assurances that they would implement increased production and savings by adopting rationalization proposals during the next five-year plan (1961-1965).

　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague: Czechoslovakia's industrial departments have achieved new results in all aspects of technological innovation. In the first half of this year, employees put forward 136,716 new proposals, an increase of 19% compared with the same period last year.

　　More than 54,000 of these proposals have been applied to production, an increase of approximately 25% compared with the first half of 1959.

　　More than 50% of these innovation proposals were put forward by workers in the heavy industry and general machine manufacturing industries. For example, in the first seven months of this year alone, workers at the Brno tractor and ball bearing factories put forward 1,400 proposals.

　　From July 1959 to July 1960, the national industrial sector actually saved more than 501 million crowns (Czech currency) due to the implementation of innovation proposals.

　　为国家节约大量资金使技术革新不断开展
　　苏波捷职工踊跃提出合理化建议
    新华社莫斯科20日电　苏联工业中的发明创造和合理化建议工作今年有了新的显著进展。
    今年上半年和去年同期相比，苏联发明家和合理化建议者的人数增加了三十万零一千人，提出的建议的数目增加了四十三万六千件，采纳的件数增加了二十五万六千件。由于采纳了这些建议，为国家节约了十五亿卢布。
    许多工厂的职工直接用合理化建议来增加工厂的七年计划基金。斯维德洛夫斯克州的职工决定要尽量提出合理化建议，以便用五年的时间完成七年计划基金积累的任务。古比雪夫州的职工决定将七年计划基金积累从十五亿卢布增加到二十亿。许多职工还订立了个人的提合理化建议的计划。例如：新克拉马托尔斯克机器厂的工人弗明，决定通过提合理化建议给工厂的七年计划基金增添一百五十万卢布。由于实行了他提出的三条合理化建议，现在已经节约了一百万卢布。
    各地职工创造了许多新的组织形式来促进合理化建议工作的开展。许多地方成立了发明家和合理化建议者协会。萨拉托夫州的协会最近检查了二十个大工厂实行合理化建议的情况，并且积极帮助这些工厂在生产过程中推行合理化建议。斯维德洛夫斯克州的工厂企业成立了六百个群众性的设计组，以推动工厂内的合理化建议工作。古比雪夫州第四轴承厂建立了六十五个包括三百五十名工人和工程技术人员的综合工作队，这些工作队决定要在七年计划期内至少提出四千五百条合理化建议。许多地区还举行竞赛观摩等活动来推动合理化建议运动。
    新华社华沙17日电　波兰的合理化建议运动日益开展。仅今年上半年各地职工就提出了四万二千多条新的合理化建议。而去年全年波兰各工业企业提出的合理化建议总数为五万六千多条。
    今年上半年各地职工还新成立了五百个技术和合理化建议俱乐部，进行研究技术革新的活动。现在全国的技术和合理化建议俱乐部已经增加到二千多个，参加俱乐部活动的达十一万人，其中一半是工人。
    为了加强领导各地的合理化建议运动，波兰工会中央理事会曾在9月12日在诺瓦胡塔列宁冶金联合企业召开了波兰合理化建议者会议，动员全国职工进一步开展合理化建议运动。会上，许多发言者都提出了保证：要在下一个五年计划（1961—1965年）期间以采用合理化建议的方法来实行增产节约。
    据新华社布拉格讯　捷克斯洛伐克工业部门各方面的技术革新获得了新成绩。今年上半年，职工们提出了十三万六千七百一十六条新建议。比去年同期增加了19％。
    其中有五万四千多条建议已运用于生产，这比1959年上半年增加约25％。
    这些革新建议50％以上是重工业和普通机器制造工业的工人提出的。例如，在今年头七个月里，单是布尔诺的拖拉机和滚珠轴承制造厂的工人就提出了一千四百条建议。
    从1959年7月到1960年7月，全国工业部门由于实行革新建议而实际节约了五亿零一百多万克朗（捷币名）。
