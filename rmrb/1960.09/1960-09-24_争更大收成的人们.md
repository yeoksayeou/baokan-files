　　People Striving for Even Greater Harvests
　　*Qin County Daily* Reporter Li Chunyuan, *People's Daily* Reporter Yang Yi

    Guo Village Management Area of Guo Village Commune, Qin County, Shanxi Province, this mountain village entrenched in the hilly area, has Li Fulin, the model first-class disabled veteran of Shanxi Province and secretary of the management area branch, Wang Dongguo, the Shanxi Province "Red, Diligent, Skillful, and Frugal" female pacesetter and their Red Flag Girls' Team, and Liu Fenwu, the militia hero who attended the National Militia Heroes' Congress and their "Ten Tigers" team. I had long heard that this advanced management area, rich in the glorious revolutionary traditions of the old liberated areas, always strives for better and better, seeking perfection in everything they do, from cadres to commune members.

    This year, their crops are already growing well enough. Like the corn in the eighth team of this management area, some are as tall as eleven feet, and generally around ten feet, more than a foot taller than the low houses by the village; some corn cobs are as long as a foot; the early-maturing yams yield one and a half catties per nest, with cracks along the roots. Because this management area's small and large field production has developed in a balanced way this year, it has become a benchmark for the masses in Qin County to chase after and compete with.

    People generally recognize that the autumn crops in Guo Village Management Area are growing well, but the commune members still feel dissatisfied. Encouraged by the slogan of launching a production increase and economy campaign centered on grain and steel, the commune members deeply realized the principle of adding one more level of work and reaping one more level of grain, and put forward the slogan of doing the autumn field processing to the end, and guaranteeing a bumper harvest by exceeding production in everything.

      Breaking Conventions and Working in the Rain
    The new task has inspired new enthusiasm among cadres and commune members. In the past, when it rained heavily, people always ran back to the village, but now it's very different. People are running to the fields in the rain.

    Not long ago, the commune members were eating lunch in the canteen when a torrential downpour suddenly began. Wang Dongguo, the captain of the eleventh team, saw the water flowing down the slope on the street in the yard and was reminded of something. She immediately called on the commune members to take their shovels and brave the rain to divert the water. Some dug, some blocked, starting with six people, increasing to more than ten in a moment, and then to more than twenty. In no time, they repaired a temporary canal from the village to the fields, collecting the overflowing floodwater and directing it straight to the fields of their team. The rain got heavier and heavier, and the water got stronger and stronger. Wang Dongguo proposed building a canal for the ninth team to divert water. The commune members immediately rushed to repair the water delivery canal for the ninth team, and notified the ninth team to come and receive water to irrigate the fields. When the commune members of the ninth team arrived, dozens of acres of cornfields were already filled with floodwater. The two teams gathered together, digging and blocking, everyone irrigating as much as they could, without caring which team belonged to which. This rain-soaked battle, without orders, lasted for six hours, enabling more than 400 acres of autumn fields in the management area to be universally irrigated by floodwater.

    While the management area received the good news that the commune members braved the rain to block water and irrigate the fields, they also received the good news that the commune members braved the rain to complete the universal application of chemical fertilizer. The course of events was as follows: since the implementation of the late-stage processing of autumn fields, everything else was easy to handle, but the commune members felt that the application of chemical fertilizer was very difficult. If the fertilizer was applied to the roots when the weather was dry and the ground was dry, the crops would not easily absorb it; at the same time, if the fertilizer was accidentally sprinkled on the branches and leaves, it would cause the branches and leaves to turn yellow. Just at this time, they encountered this rain. The operation teams and commune members who were assigned to apply chemical fertilizer in each production team set out at the same time, braving the rain and wading through the mud for a whole day, applying chemical fertilizer to more than 700 acres of land, completing the task several days ahead of schedule.

          Expedition
    The dawn in the early autumn on the Taihang Mountains has a touch of cold. As soon as it was light, Li Fulin, the secretary of the branch, personally led the youth shock team out of the village and headed for Shizhu Mountain, fifteen miles away.

    Back in the summer, while actively completing the summer planting tasks, the Guo Village Management Area formed a remote farming team to open up 37 acres of wasteland on Shizhu Mountain and sow buckwheat, small black beans, yams, and foreign kidney beans in order to expand the planting area. Because the commune members were constantly organized to go up the mountain for processing, the whole process ensured the full growth of seedlings. In the later stage management of various autumn crops, some commune members suggested launching an expedition to rush to process the wasteland reclaimed on Shizhu Mountain. Eighteen young women volunteered for this task.

    These young women, carrying tools, luggage, and chemical fertilizers, sang mountain songs and rushed up Shizhu Mountain. They set up camp in two old cave dwellings and immediately launched a battle to seize the autumn harvest in the 37 acres of late autumn land, pulling out weeds when they saw them, removing insects when they found them, and hoeing the land plot by plot. When the yam seedlings turned yellow, they adopted the method of foliar fertilization, applying phosphorus fertilizer twice. Other late autumn crops were not suitable for applying phosphorus fertilizer, so they organized six women to pick up sheep manure along the slopes, dig fertilizer ponds at the edge of the fields, and make green fertilizer in large quantities to give the buckwheat and foreign kidney beans a special meal, attack the seeds and pods, and promote the early maturity and increased harvest of late autumn crops. Things became different as soon as they were in the hands of young people. The task originally assigned by the management area was to be completed in ten days, but these shock troops completed the task in only six days. The meticulousness of the women's work could be seen everywhere. In September, when the buckwheat flowers bloomed, a fragrance filled the air. Guo Juxian, known as the "Millet Hill Forest," even brought two boxes of bees from the nursing home with her sisters when she went up the mountain, put them in the buckwheat field, let the bees collect honey and pollinate, and let the buckwheat increase production even more.

      Third-Class Fields Become Great Leap Forward Fields
    According to the usual practice, commune members always hope that people will visit their high-yield fields, but here, commune members always want people to see the original third-class fields. Not far to the east of the village, there are 30 acres of cornfields and 9 acres of millet fields that are all third-class fields. According to the commune members, because they were planted too densely, the ears had emerged in other fields, while most of the seedlings in these two plots had not sprouted ears by the "End of Heat." "End of Heat" is a critical point for the success or failure of autumn crops. There is a saying: "If the head doesn't emerge by the End of Heat, cut it down and feed it to the cattle." But this year, under the new situation, after discussion between the cadres and the commune members, they all believed that they must not bear this loss and quickly took a series of remedial measures, applying mixed fertilizer twice in a row, first green fertilizer, then chemical fertilizer, closely combined with hoeing and plowing, and diverting floodwater for irrigation when it rained, combining water and fertilizer. As a result, small ears emerged universally in a few days and grew rapidly. Because these two plots of land grew well, they were rated by the management area as a model field for the Great Leap Forward in late-stage processing.

                        ＊　＊　＊
    According to the latest summary by Wang Niuhai, the statistician of the management area, the labor attendance rate in the entire management area reached 95% during the autumn field management, and 80% of the labor force was invested in the front line of production. So far, the 3,000 acres of autumn fields in the entire area have been universally top-dressed with fertilizer three times, basically completing the target of increasing the application of 10 loads of fertilizer per acre; the area of autumn fields that have been irrigated with floodwater in the later stage has doubled compared with previous years; the earthing up of tall crops such as corn and sorghum has been done with large and round piles; the millet has been diligently and carefully hoed, and the record of no weeds in the fields has been maintained from the beginning to the present.

　　争更大收成的人们
　　沁县报记者　李春园　本报记者　杨义
    山西沁县郭村公社郭村管理区，这个盘踞在丘陵地带的山村庄，有荣获山西省一等残废军人模范、管理区支部书记李富林，山西省“红、勤、巧、俭”妇女标兵王东果和她们红旗姑娘队，还有出席过全国民兵群英会的民兵英雄刘奋武和他们“十虎”队员。老早就听说，这个富有老解放区革命光荣传统的先进管理区，从干部到社员，无论作什么事情，总是好上加好，精里求精。
    今年他们的庄稼已经长得够好了。像这个管理区第八队的玉米，高的达一丈一尺，一般的一丈上下，比村边小平房还要高一尺多，玉米穗有的长达一尺；红旗姑娘队的丰产谷，几十个姑娘在谷地操作，看不见人迹影；早熟山药蛋，一窝挖一斤半，顺着根裂开了龟纹缝。因为这个管理区今年的小田大田生产平衡发展，便成了沁县群众追赶竞赛的标兵。
    人们都公认郭村管理区的秋禾长得好，可是郭村社员却还是感到不满足。在开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动的口号鼓舞下，社员们深刻体会到多加一成工，多收一成粮的道理，提出了秋田加工干到头，样样超产保丰收的口号。
      打破常规冒雨干
    新任务激发了干部和社员们的新干劲。过去遇到下大雨，人们总是往村里跑，可是现在大不相同，人们却是冒着雨往地里跑。
    不久前，社员们正在食堂吃午饭，霎时间下开了倾盆大雨。十一队队长王东果看到院内街上的水顺坡而流，触景生情想起了一件事，马上招呼社员拿上铁锹，冒雨拨水。挖的挖，堵的堵，开始时六个人，一会增加到十多个，一会又增加到二十多人。不大一会工夫，修好了一道由村通往田间的临时渠，把漫流的洪水汇集起来，直流到他们队里的田地。雨越下越大，水越来越旺，王东果提出要为九队修渠分水。社员们马上一方面突击为九队整修送水渠，一方面通知九队来接水浇地。九队社员闻讯赶来的时候，数十亩玉米地已灌满了洪水。两支队伍汇集到一起，抢挖抢堵，大家能多浇一亩算一亩，谁也不计较你队我队。这场没有命令的浴雨战一直持续了六小时，使管理区四百多亩秋田普遍受到洪水灌溉。
    管理区接到社员们冒雨拦水浇地喜报的同时，还收到了社员们冒雨完成了普施化肥的捷报。事情的经过是这样的：自从开展秋田后期加工以后，别的事情都好办，唯有施化肥这件事社员们感到很难办。天旱地干把化肥施在根部，庄稼不易吸收；同时不小心把化肥撒在枝叶上，会引起枝叶枯黄现象。正在这个时候遇上这场雨，各个生产队分工施化肥的作业小组和社员不约而同地出动了，冒雨淌泥整整干了一天，在七百多亩地里施了化肥，提前好几天完成了任务。
          出师远征
    太行山上初秋的拂晓，颇有寒意。天麻麻亮，支部书记李富林亲自率领的青年突击队，出了村，奔往十五里以外的石柱山。
    还在夏天，郭村管理区在积极完成夏种任务的同时，为了扩大播种面积，组成了一支远耕队，跑到石柱山上开出荒地三十七亩，播种了荞麦、小黑豆、山药、洋小豆。由于不断组织社员们上山加工，前一段保证了苗全苗旺。在后期管理各种秋作物中，有的社员提出远征突击加工石柱山开垦荒地的建议后，十八个青年妇女们自报奋勇担任了这一任务。
    这些青年妇女带着工具、行李、化肥，唱着山歌奔上了石柱山。在两个旧窑洞里，安营下寨，马上在三十七亩晚秋地里，展开了夺秋大战，见草就拔，有虫就除，逐块加锄。山药蛋苗子黄，她们就采取根外施肥的办法，施了二次磷肥。其它晚秋不宜施磷肥，她们就组织了六个妇女，沿坡拾羊粪，地头挖沤肥池，大造青肥，给荞麦、洋小豆吃了偏饭，攻籽攻荚，促晚秋早熟多收。事情一到了青年手里，就显得不一样，原来从管理区领的任务是十天完成，可是这伙突击手们只用了六天就完成了任务。妇女们作活那股细心劲儿处处可见，9月天荞麦花开，一片清香，被称为“小米丘林”的郭菊先在上山时，还和姐妹们抬来敬老院两箱蜜蜂，放在荞麦地里，让蜜蜂采蜜授粉，让荞麦更多增产。
      三类田成了跃进田
    按照通常的习惯社员们总是希望人们参观他们的丰产田，可是在这里社员们总要人们去看看原来的三类田。村东不远有三十亩玉米地和九亩谷子地都是三类田。据社员们说，由于种得较密了一些，别的地里都出了穗，而这二块地绝大部分株苗，到“处暑”还没有绣穗。“处暑”对秋庄稼来说是个成败的关口，有句农谚：“处暑不出头，割下喂了牛”。可是今年在新形势下，干部、社员一商议，都认为绝不能承受这份损失，迅速采取了一系列的补救措施，连续上了两次混合肥料，先施青肥，后施化肥，紧密结合锄耧，下了雨就引洪水灌溉，水肥并施。结果不几日普遍孕出了小穗，迅速成长起来。因为这两块地生长良好，被管理区评为后期加工跃进标兵地。
                        ＊　＊　＊
    根据管理区统计员王牛孩最近汇总的结果，在秋田管理中全管理区劳动出勤率达到了95％，有80％的劳动力投入了生产第一线。到目前为止，全区三千亩秋田已普追三次肥，基本上完成了每亩地增施十担肥的指标；进行了后期洪水灌溉的秋田比往年扩大了两倍；玉米高粱等高秆作物培土，做到堆大堆圆；谷子勤锄细锄，从开始到目前，一直保持了田间无杂草的纪录。
