	News in Brief
	
	Tangshan Steel Plant Reduces Pig Iron Consumption
	In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, Tangshan Steel Plant in Hebei Province, after mobilizing the masses to calculate the "three accounts" (calculating the advanced indicator account, calculating the account of improving steel ingot quality and reducing molten iron spillage, and calculating the savings account), did everything possible to tap potential, significantly reducing pig iron consumption in converter steelmaking. In mid-September, the plant's average pig iron consumption per ton of steel decreased from 1,331 kilograms in August to 1,117 kilograms, reaching the advanced level of pig iron consumption in large-scale converter steelmaking nationwide. The Wang Yiyuan steelmaking group also created an excellent record of using only 885 kilograms of iron to make one ton of steel.
	
	Using Coke Breeze to Make More Iron
	Workers at the Guanghua Iron and Steel Plant in Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province, used coke breeze—coke waste—to make coke balls to replace lump coke for ironmaking. From May to September 15, they used a total of 480 tons of coke balls, equivalent to saving more than 1,300 tons of coal. Using these coke balls, they increased pig iron production by more than 390 tons.
	
	Timely Completion of Steel Equipment Sets
	Jiangxi Province's machinery industry concentrated its crack troops to vigorously grasp the production of complete sets of equipment for steelmaking, steel rolling, and coking. The Provincial Machinery Industry Administration organized working groups to go deep into several key machinery plants to understand the situation of blanks, processes, drawings, matching, and collaboration. They took effective measures in a timely manner to solve problems, ensuring that all key products were produced according to schedule and delivered in complete sets as planned. From July 1 to September 10, the steel equipment produced in 70 days increased by more than nine times compared to the first half of the year, strongly supporting the increase in steel production.
	
	Focusing on Both Coal Production and Transportation
	Yangmeishan Coal Mine in Hunan Province, while vigorously increasing coal production, also focused on coal transportation. They mobilized the masses and adopted a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to manufacture many local devices. They also organized a large-scale competition within the mine and carried out large-scale collaboration with the railway department, effectively improving transportation efficiency. In the week since mid-September, short-distance collection and transportation in the mining area exceeded the plan by more than 100 tons.
	
	Everyone Saves Raw Coal and Increases Coke Production
	In order to promote a substantial increase in steel production, the workers of Sanyuan Coking Plant in Shaanxi Province launched an activity to save one jin of raw coal and increase one jin of coke production per person per day. The workers adopted many measures to increase production and save resources, such as using muddy coal for coking, and developed a habit of picking up discarded coal and collecting scattered coke. According to statistics from September 1 to 5 alone, the plant saved 3,000 jin of raw coal and increased coke production by 20,000 jin.
	
	Self-Made Parts Improve Vehicle Transportation Efficiency
	The Second Transportation Team of the Nanchong Special District Transportation Company in Sichuan Province implemented the "three-in-one" approach of driving, manufacturing, and repairing. They made full use of available resources and established many repair and manufacturing factories to produce a large number of auto parts to equip themselves. From June to August this year, the entire team has established eight small factories for parts repair and processing, tire repair, etc., producing more than 92,000 various auto parts. Now, the team has achieved self-sufficiency in most of the parts and spares used by all vehicles. Relying on their own efforts, they have equipped all old and outdated vehicles. All new and old vehicles have achieved trailer transportation, and the average ton-kilometer monthly output per vehicle has increased from 5,000 ton-kilometers to 20,000 ton-kilometers.

    要闻快报
    唐山钢厂降低生铁消耗
    河北唐山钢厂在增产节约运动中，经过发动群众算“三笔账”（算先进指标账，算提高钢锭质量、减少跑铁等事故账，算节约账），千方百计挖掘潜力，使转炉炼钢的生铁消耗显著降低。九月中旬，全厂平均每吨钢的生铁消耗由八月份的一千三百三十一公斤，降低到一千一百一十七公斤，达到全国大型转炉炼钢生铁消耗的先进水平。王益元炼钢小组还创造了只用八百八十五公斤铁炼一吨钢的优异成绩。
    利用焦屑多炼铁
    江苏省常州市广化钢铁厂职工利用焦炭下脚——焦屑，做成焦球，代替块焦炼铁。从五月到九月十五日，共用焦球四百八十吨，相当于节约煤炭一千三百多吨。利用这些焦球，增产了三百九十多吨生铁。
    及时把钢铁设备配成套
    江西省机械工业集中精兵猛将，狠抓炼钢、轧钢、炼焦设备配套产品的生产。省机械工业管理局组织工作组，深入几个重点机械厂，了解毛坯、工艺、图纸、配套和协作等方面的情况，及时采取有效措施解决问题，使各种重点产品全部按照进度生产，保证如期成套。从七月一日到九月十日，七十天生产的钢铁设备，比上半年完成数字增长九倍多，有力地支援了钢铁增产。
    一手抓产煤一手抓调运
    湖南杨梅山煤矿在大抓煤炭增产的同时，大抓煤炭调运。他们发动群众，采取土洋结合的办法，制造了许多土设备，并在矿内组织大竞赛，同铁路部门开展大协作，有效地提高了运输效率。九月中旬以来的一周内，矿区短途集运超过计划一百多吨。
    人人节约原煤增产焦炭
    陕西省三原炼焦厂职工为了促进钢铁大幅度增产，掀起了每人每天节约一斤原煤和增产一斤焦炭的活动。职工们采取了泥煤炼焦等许多增产节约措施，并养成了见丢掉的煤块就拣、见抛撒的焦块就拾的风气。仅据九月一日到五日的统计，全厂就节约原煤三千斤，增产焦炭二万斤。
    自制配件提高汽车运输效率
    四川南充专区运输公司汽车二队实行驾驶、制造、修理“三合一”，因陋就简，大办修造工厂，生产大量汽车配件装备自己。从今年六月到八月份，全车队已办起部件修配加工、轮胎修补等八个小型工厂，生产了各种汽车配件九万二千多件。现在全队车辆所用配件、备件已做到大部分自给。他们依靠自己的力量装备了所有陈旧超龄汽车，新车、老车全部实现了拖挂运输，平均车吨月产量已从五千吨公里上升到二万吨公里。
