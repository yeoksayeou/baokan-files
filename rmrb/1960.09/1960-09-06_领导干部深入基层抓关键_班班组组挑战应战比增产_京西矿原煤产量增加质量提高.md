Leading Cadres Go Deep into the Grassroots to Grasp Key Issues; Shifts and Teams Challenge and Respond to Increase Production
Jingxi Mine's Raw Coal Output Increases and Quality Improves
Pingxiang Coal Mine Launches a "Individual Guarantees Group, Group Guarantees Shift, Shift Guarantees District" Chain Competition

(By this newspaper) A drive to seize high coal production in the increase production and practice economy movement is unfolding vigorously in the Jingxi Mining Bureau. From August 21, when the bureau's employees began discussing the plan for increasing production and practicing economy, to September 3, the average daily output of raw coal and the daily footage of tunneling increased by 3.7% and 19% respectively, compared with the first twenty days of August. The quality of coal has improved. The overall efficiency, pit timber consumption, and costs have all reached or exceeded the planned targets.

The bureau's entire staff recently reviewed the completion of the production plan this year. Each mine, section, and team carefully calculated accounts, tapped potential, and formulated further production increase targets and specific measures, throwing themselves into the battle to seize high coal production with greater enthusiasm. In recent days, mines have been sounding gongs and drums, sending each other battle reports. The socialist labor competition between mining areas, shifts, teams, and individuals is in full swing. The No. 1 Team and No. 11 Team, the two largest teams in the Chengzhi Coal Mine, launched a counterpart competition. The No. 1 Team workers, who had overfulfilled the Great Leap Forward plan, challenged the No. 11 Team on August 23. The No. 11 Team workers immediately calculated accounts carefully. They strengthened the preparatory work during work shifts, promoted the advanced experience of deep-hole blasting, and formulated two sets of coal mining methods for normal and abnormal coal seams. Competitions were also launched between various shifts within the team. After a week of hard work, they also completed the August Great Leap Forward plan ahead of schedule. Such scenes of chasing and catching up with each other to ensure high coal production are seen everywhere in the Jingxi Mining Bureau's mines. The No. 34 tunneling team of Mentougou Coal Mine changed the "one-time slot pulling" method to the "two-time slot pulling" method, increased the number of switches on the transport rail, and increased the footage efficiency by 30%. The number of cars loaded per shift increased from twenty to thirty-six. The No. 22 tunneling team quickly caught up, examining the previous thinking that they were afraid of trouble when promoting advanced experiences, and re-adopted the "relay slotting" method. The shift footage also quickly increased from the original two meters to 6.2 meters.

The employees of auxiliary departments such as material supply, machine repair, canteen, and sanitation in the bureau's mines also fully invested in the increase production and practice economy movement, trying every means to ensure high coal production. In the Chengzhi Coal Mine, the employees of the electrical and mechanical departments used to repair electric drills on the surface, but now they repair them underground. The materials section used to issue materials on the surface only once a day, but now it issues them underground four times a day, so that miners can receive materials in a timely manner during each shift. The coal chute of the Dayu No. 20 team of Mentougou Coal Mine used to be repaired little by little when it was damaged, and there were often leaks, which affected coal transportation. This time, the machine repair department carried out a thorough overhaul, increasing the average daily coal transport volume from 210 tons to 380 tons.

In the vigorous battle to seize high coal production, the bureau's cadres left their offices and rushed to the production front lines, which not only greatly boosted the workers' enthusiasm for labor, but also enabled many key problems to be solved in a timely manner. Accelerating tunneling and increasing the coal mining work face is the key to the continuous leap forward in coal mine production. After the Anjiatan Mine Party Committee discovered that tunneling was lagging behind coal mining, a deputy secretary of the Party Committee led a group of cadres to go deep into the grassroots. In response to the thinking of some employees who emphasized coal mining over tunneling, they organized special discussions to help everyone further understand the importance of tunneling to the entire coal production. They immediately took measures to strengthen the cooperation of the electrical and mechanical, transportation, and material departments with the tunneling work, and inserted red flags and set up pacesetters in the tunneling teams, promoting advanced experiences, which greatly accelerated the tunneling progress. Yue Fenglin, the section chief of the Chengzhi Coal Mine tunneling section, was sent to work in the No. 23 team. Li Tiancheng, the small team leader, studied and improved the coal digging method and promoted deep-hole operations, which increased the shift footage by 20% and saved explosives. Then, Yue Fenglin helped Gao Yurun's team promote this experience, which also accelerated the tunneling progress.

Recently, the Jingxi Mining Bureau issued a proposal to coal mine employees across the country to launch a socialist competition to ensure the early completion of the annual state plan. The measures proposed in the proposal to ensure the early completion of the plan are: First, adhere to putting politics in command, continue to vigorously carry out mass movements, vigorously carry out the increase production and practice economy movement centered on grain and steel, and continue to widely carry out the large-scale high-yield red flag competition movement. Second, continue to deeply carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. For the innovation projects that have emerged in the previous period, under the leadership of the Party Committee, adopt the method of combining leading cadres with workers and technicians to sort out and appraise them. Summarize, improve, and quickly promote those innovation projects that have the greatest effect and are of universal significance, and speed up the construction of coal storage and line transformation projects so that the transportation capacity can adapt to the new situation of continuous leap forward. Third, further improve the leadership style and working methods, and improve enterprise management. Fourth, while striving to complete the state production plan ahead of schedule, arrange the lives of employees well.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 5th - Employees of the Jiangxi Pingxiang Coal Mine have launched a vigorous high tide of producing more coal and good coal in order to guarantee the increase in steel production.

In the increase production and practice economy movement centered on grain and steel, the employees of Pingxiang Coal Mine conscientiously summarized past production experience, discussed plans from mine to district, from team to individual at each level, and put forward many measures aimed at the key and weak links in production. The employees' enthusiasm became more and more high, they were full of confidence, tapped potential in a big way, and launched a vigorous high tide of producing more coal and good coal in the competition. The workers of the youth team of the No. 3 mining area of ​​Qingshan Mine changed the organizational form of one team and one group in the competition to three groups in one team, which can not only make full use of working hours, but also better carry out the competition between groups. After changing the organizational form, the production appearance quickly changed: before August 21, the average daily output was only 123 tons, and after August 21, the average daily output reached 150 tons, exceeding the plan by 9.4%. The workers in the Xipingxiang mining area of ​​Anyuan Mine put forward many methods to speed up the cycle and improve the underground transportation measures, so that the monthly plan was overfulfilled.

In order to compete for speed and seize time, many workers in the production area also carried out a chain competition of "Individual Guarantees Group, Group Guarantees Shift, Shift Guarantees District" and a new record creation movement. The workers of Wangjiayuan Mine created more than 70 new production records on August 24 and 25, the highest record exceeding the plan by more than 180%. The workers in the Sanqiutian District of Anyuan Mine completed the August production plan ahead of schedule on August 24, and then joined the battle to complete the production increase plan ahead of schedule. The workers in the Dachao District of Anyuan Mine recently launched a "Capture Shangganling" competition activity in order to open up a work face supplying coking coal for Wuhan Iron and Steel Company as soon as possible, and the shift output has more than doubled compared with the original. The Shuikou No. 4 District of Qingshan Mine, which has won the title of advanced production unit in the province for several consecutive times, has recently achieved higher and higher daily output under the difficult conditions of poor roof and frequent breakage of the electro-sliding bar, reaching a maximum of 147 tons, which is more than three times higher than the plan.

    领导干部深入基层抓关键　班班组组挑战应战比增产
    京西矿原煤产量增加质量提高
    萍乡煤矿开展“个人保小组、小组保班、班保区”的连环赛
    本报讯　一个夺取煤炭高产的增产节约运动，正在京西矿务局轰轰烈烈地展开。全局职工从讨论增产节约计划的8月21日开始到9月3日的十四天中，原煤平均日产量和掘进日进尺，分别比8月前二十天提高3.7％和19％。煤的质量有了提高。全员效率、坑木消耗、成本等也都分别达到和超过了计划指标。
    这个局的全体职工，最近检查了今年以来完成生产计划的情况，各矿、各个工段和班组，都算细账，挖潜力，订出了进一步增产的指标和具体措施，以更大干劲投入了夺取煤炭高产的战斗。连日来，各矿鸣锣击鼓，互送战表，采区与采区、班与班、组与组、个人与个人之间的社会主义劳动竞赛进行得热火朝天。城子煤矿两个最大的小组——一组和十一组展开了对口赛。超额完成跃进计划的一组工人在8月23日向十一组提出了挑战。十一组工人立刻算了细账。他们加强了工作交替时的准备工作，推广了深孔爆破的先进经验，订出了煤层正常和不正常时的两套采煤方法，全组各班之间也展开竞赛，经一周奋战，也提前完成了8月份跃进计划。像这样你追我赶，保证煤炭高产的热烈场面，在京西矿务局所属各煤矿中，到处可见。门头沟煤矿掘进三十四队把“一次拉槽”法改为“二次拉槽”法，增加了运输铁轨的道岔，进尺效率提高30％，每班装车由二十次增加到三十六次。掘进二十二队急起直追，检查了以前推广先进经验怕麻烦的思想，重新采用“接力掏槽”法，班进尺也由原来的二米，迅速增加到六点二米。
    全局各矿材料供应、机修、食堂、卫生等辅助部门的职工，也全力投入增产节约运动，千方百计保证煤炭高产。城子煤矿机电部门的职工以前小修电钻都是在井上修，现在下井检修。材料科过去在井上发料，一天只发一次，现在改为在井下每天发四次，每班矿工都可以在井下及时领到材料。门头沟煤矿大峪二十队的溜煤道，以前坏一点修一点，经常有漏眼，影响运煤，这次机修部门进行了彻底检修，使平均日运煤量由二百一十吨提高到三百八十吨。
    在轰轰烈烈的夺取煤炭高产的战斗中，这个局的广大干部纷纷离开办公室，奔赴生产第一线，不仅大大鼓舞了工人的劳动热情，也使很多关键问题得到及时解决。加快掘进增加采煤工作面是煤矿生产持续跃进的关键。安家滩矿党委发现掘进落后采煤的情况以后，由一位党委副书记率领一批干部深入基层，针对部分职工重回采、轻掘进的思想，组织专题讨论，使大家进一步认识了掘进工作对整个煤炭生产的重要意义。他们立即采取措施，加强机电、运输、材料等部门对掘进工作的配合，并在掘进小组中插红旗、树标兵，推广先进经验，结果大大加速了掘进进度。城子煤矿掘进段段长岳风林下放到二十三组劳动，小班长李天成研究改进掏煤方法，推行深孔作业，使班进尺提高了20％，并节省了火药。接着，岳风林又帮助高玉润班推广了这项经验，也加快了掘进进度。
    最近，京西矿务局向全国煤矿职工发出了开展社会主义竞赛的倡议书，保证提前完成全年国家计划。倡议书中提出的保证提前完成计划的措施是：第一、坚持政治挂帅，继续大搞群众运动，大闹以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动，继续广泛开展大面积高产红旗竞赛运动。第二、继续深入开展技术革新和技术革命运动。对前一时期涌现出的革新项目，在党委领导下，采取领导干部同工人、技术人员三结合的办法，加以整理和鉴定，对那些收效最大和有普遍意义的革新项目，加以总结、提高并迅速推广，加快煤仓、线路改造工程的速度，使运输能力适应持续跃进的新形势。第三、进一步改进领导作风和工作方法，改进企业管理。第四、在努力提前完成国家生产计划的同时，安排好职工生活。
    新华社南昌5日电　江西萍乡煤矿职工掀起了轰轰烈烈的多产煤、产好煤，以保证钢铁增产的竞赛高潮。
    在以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中，萍乡煤矿职工认真地总结过去的生产经验，从矿到区、从小组到个人层层讨论计划，针对生产关键和薄弱环节，提出了许多措施。职工们干劲越鼓越足，信心百倍，大挖潜力，掀起了轰轰烈烈的多产煤、产好煤的竞赛高潮。青山矿回采三区青年班的工人在竞赛中把原来一个班一个大组的组织形式，改为一个班三个小组，这样不仅可以充分利用工时，而且可以更好地开展组与组的竞赛。改变组织形式以后，生产面貌迅速起了变化：8月21日以前，平均日产量仅一百二十三吨，21日以后平均日产量达到一百五十吨，超过计划9.4％。安源矿西平巷采掘区工人提出许多加快循环进度的办法和改进井下运输的措施，从而使月计划超额完成。
    为了争速度，抢时间，许多生产区的工人，还开展了“个人保小组、小组保班、班保区”的连环竞赛和创造新纪录运动。王家源矿的工人在8月24日和25日两天，创造了七十多次生产新纪录，最高纪录超过计划180％以上。安源矿三丘田区工人在8月24日就提前完成了8月份生产计划，紧接着又投入了为提前超额完成增产计划的战斗。安源矿大槽区的工人，为及早开辟供应武钢炼焦煤的工作面，最近开展了“攻上甘岭”的竞赛活动，班产量比原来提高了一倍多。连续获得省先进生产单位称号的青山矿水口四区，最近在顶板不好、电溜子镀条经常断的困难情况下，日产量越来越高，最高达到一百四十七吨，比计划提高三倍多。
