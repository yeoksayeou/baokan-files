Envoys of the Japanese Theater World
The Japanese visiting theater troupe, consisting of seventy-one members, led by the head of the delegation, the famous playwright Tomoyoshi Murayama, and deputy heads Koreya Senda, Osamu Takizawa, Yaeko Yamamoto, and Haruko Sugimura, arrived in our country on September 16 with the deep friendship of the Japanese people for the Chinese people. Soon, they will meet the Chinese audience on stage.

The Japanese theater troupe visiting our country this time is jointly composed of five famous Japanese theater groups: Tokyo Art Troupe, Mingei Theater, Haiyuza Theater, Budokai Theater, and Bungakuza Theater. In addition to the heads and deputy heads of the delegation, who are all famous figures in the Japanese theater world, the delegation also includes famous directors and actors such as Tetsuji Matsuo, Teruko Mine, Junji Kinoshita, Ichiro Inui, and Koji Yazaki. The Japanese theater troupe's visit to China marks the first overseas performance in the fifty-four years since the birth of Japanese drama, and therefore has received attention from the art circles in Japan and abroad.

The five theater groups that make up the Japanese visiting theater troupe have continuously strengthened their unity through several joint performances and through the nationwide struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Law" and especially against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The organizational process of the Japanese theater troupe also embodies their fighting unity. All members of the Japanese theater troupe unanimously believe that they should not only promote cultural exchange between the Chinese and Japanese peoples, but also strive to promote the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, to realize Japan's peace and independence, and to consolidate world peace. Deputy head of the Japanese theater troupe, Koreya Senda, said: "Up until now, drama, including the proletarian drama that once existed, seems to have only an abstract understanding of the masses. However, through struggles such as the opposition to the revision of the 'Police Duties Law' and the opposition to the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty,' the drama world has seen the first great unity in the history of Japanese drama, and at the same time has been able to break away from abstract concepts and have a personal and concrete feeling for the masses. We want to introduce this new experience to China."

Before coming to China, the Japanese theater troupe not only conducted intensive rehearsals, but also formed a study committee to conduct relevant studies. They listened to reports on "The History of Sino-Japanese Relations" and "Chinese Classical and Modern Drama," and also studied Chinese. Among the self-study reference books listed by the study committee were: Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China," and Shigeki Kaizuka's "Mao Zedong," and other documents. The study committee also decided to compile a publication "Study Notes" when the visit to China for performance is completed.

The Japanese theater troupe will stage three large-scale plays in our country. Tomoyoshi Murayama, the head of the theater troupe, wrote a new work "Dead Sea" specifically for this visit to China, which depicts the story of Japanese fishermen participating in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." "Yuzuru," written by Junji Kinoshita, a member of the theater troupe, is a play based on folk mythology. There is also "A Woman's Life" by the playwright Kaoru Morimoto.

In addition, the Japanese theater troupe has also prepared several living newspaper recitations such as "The Record of the Struggle to Stop the Revision of the 'Security Treaty'," "Miike Coal Mine," and "Okinawa Island." (Feng)

    日本戏剧界的使者
    日本访华话剧团一行七十一人，在团长、著名剧作家村山知义、副团长千田是也、泷泽修、山本安英和杉村春子率领下，带着日本人民对中国人民的深厚友谊，于9月16日来我国进行访问。不久，他们就要在舞台上同我国观众见面了。
    这次来我国访问的日本话剧团，是由日本著名的东京艺术座、民艺剧团、俳优座、葡萄会、文学座五个话剧团体联合组成的。这个代表团除正副团长都是日本话剧界著名人士外，代表团还有松尾哲次、峰辉子、木下顺二、戌井市郎、屋崎宏次等名编导、名演员。日本话剧团到中国访问，是日本话剧产生五十四年以来第一次的海外公演，因此受到日本国内外艺术界的重视。
    组成日本访华话剧团的五个话剧团，经过数次联合演出，经过反对“警职法”修正案，特别是反对日美“安全条约”的全民性斗争，不断地加强了团结。日本话剧团的组织过程也体现了他们战斗的团结。日本话剧团的全体人员一致认为，不仅在中国人民与日本人民之间促进文化交流，并且要为促进日中邦交的恢复和实现日本的和平与独立、为巩固世界和平而努力。日本话剧团副团长千田是也说：“迄今为止的话剧，包括曾经有过的普罗戏剧在内，似乎对于群众只有抽象的了解。但是，经过反对‘警职法’修正案和反对日美‘安全条约’等斗争，话剧界出现了日本话剧史上第一次的大团结，同时能够打破了抽象的观念，对于群众有了切身的具体感受。我们要把这种新的体验向中国作一番介绍。”
    日本话剧团在来中国之前，不仅进行了紧张的排练，而且组成学习委员会进行有关的学习。他们听了“日中关系史”、“中国古典和现代戏剧”的报告，并且学习汉语。在学习委员会开列的自修参考书目中有：毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”、“中国共产党三十年”、贝冢茂树著“毛泽东”等文献。学习委员会还决定到访华演出完毕时编一个刊物“学习札记”。
    日本话剧团将在我国上演三个大型话剧。话剧团团长村山知义特为此次访华演出而写的新作“死海”，描写日本渔民参加反对日美“安全条约”斗争的故事。话剧团团员木下顺二作的“夕鹤”，是以民间神话为题材的剧目。还有剧作家森本熏作的“女人的一生”。
    此外，日本话剧团还准备了“阻止修改‘安全条约’斗争的纪录”、“三池煤矿”和“冲绳岛”等几个活报朗诵剧。（峰）
