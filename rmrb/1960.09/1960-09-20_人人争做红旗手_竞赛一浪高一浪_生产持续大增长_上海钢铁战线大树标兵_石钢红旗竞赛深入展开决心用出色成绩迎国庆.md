Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 19th: Shanghai's steel plants have established a large number of model workers in the production increase and economy campaign, promoting a competitive upsurge that is developing wave upon wave, thereby promoting the continuous leap forward in steel production. Since September, the city's steel production has continued to increase significantly.

To plant more red flags, establish more model workers, and have everyone strive to be a red banner bearer, is a sign that the mass movement on Shanghai's iron and steel front has developed more deeply. Since the beginning of this year, competition activities between plants and plants, workshops and workshops, have never stopped. Among the city's five major converter workshops, there are small evaluations every five days and large evaluations every month, making the atmosphere of striving for excellence particularly intense. Within each factory, the competition between furnaces, shifts, sections, and groups is even more heated. The city's steel production has leaped again and again, with new records appearing one after another. In August, various factories studied and caught up with the city's model furnace – No. 1 molten iron furnace of the No. 2 converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 – pushing the competition movement to a new stage. After the factories seriously promoted the experience of "politics to the front of the furnace" of No. 1 molten iron furnace, the revolutionary consciousness of the broad masses of workers was further enhanced, and the communist style of large-scale collaboration between upper and lower levels and left and right was growing stronger and stronger. Red banner furnaces, red banner work sections, red banner groups, and red banner shock workers (model workers) are increasing in number. In brick-making, furnace building, charging, material transportation, small trains, winches, warehouses, and various departments and positions in offices, model workers are in abundance. After mass appraisal in August, several large steel plants such as Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 and Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 established more than 3,200 model workers, who, together with the broad masses, actively took the lead in working hard, practically, and cleverly in different positions. Some have improved the melting rate, some have shortened the smelting time, some have further improved the quality, and many advanced levels have quickly become universal levels. At present, the melting rate and desulfurization rate of the No. 1 molten iron furnace of the No. 1 molten iron workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 and the No. 3 molten iron furnace of the No. 2 converter workshop, the No. 1 molten iron furnace of the No. 2 converter workshop of Plant No. 1, and the No. 4 molten iron furnace of the No. 3 converter workshop are approaching or catching up with the level of the model No. 1 molten iron furnace.

The movement of planting more red flags and establishing more model workers is an important aspect of mobilizing the masses to do political and ideological work and agitation work. When evaluating model workers, not only are operations and techniques compared, but also thoughts, styles, and cooperation are compared, which can better motivate morale, inspire fighting spirit, and enhance unity and cooperation among various types of work. After the No. 1 molten iron furnace of the No. 2 converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 was rated as a model furnace in the workshop, when the furnace experienced "iron clotting" in the later stage, the charging workers waited by the material line, and the material yard workers carefully performed "coarse material fine work" for the molten iron furnace; the furnace workers insisted on diligent ventilation eyes to keep the ventilation eyes round, bright, and unobstructed. All workers worked tirelessly to cherish collective honor, so that the melting rate, desulfurization rate, and furnace life of this furnace have always maintained a high level. The workers of the open hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, which won the national red flag for high production of small open hearth furnaces, conducted shift-by-shift and daily evaluations in the competition, promptly overcame shortcomings, and promoted advantages. They summarized and summarized the main advanced experiences of the workshop into 34 articles, promoting them into production without any omissions, thus further shortening the smelting time of each furnace of steel, generally only about 4 hours and 30 minutes since September.

Each factory and workshop not only plants red flags among the advanced levels, but also pays attention to grasping the advanced seedlings in the backward workshops, work sections, and groups, and establishing model workers, so that everyone has an object to catch up with and everyone has a model worker to learn from. This further promotes the backward to catch up with the advanced, forming a new atmosphere of continuous emergence of latecomers. The converter workshop of a steel plant under the Municipal Metallurgical Bureau had relatively backward production before August, and the melting rate of molten iron furnaces was low. Later, the leading cadres of the workshop discovered that the safety bricks of No. 6 molten iron furnace had been used for 63 furnaces without damage, and the leading cadres and the masses of workers established No. 6 furnace as a model furnace. At that time, some cadres believed that the service life of safety bricks in molten iron furnaces in some factories had exceeded 100 furnaces, so what was 63 furnaces worth as a red banner furnace. However, the workshop leaders insisted on planting a red flag on No. 6 furnace, because the level of 63 furnaces was the advanced level under the specific conditions of the workshop at that time. After the red banner furnace was established, it further promoted the development of mass competition. On the one hand, the masses of workers conscientiously learned from the advanced experience of brother factories, and on the other hand, they helped their model furnace to break through technical bottlenecks and accumulate operating experience in many ways. As a result, the life of the safety bricks of No. 6 furnace quickly rose from 63 furnaces to a higher level, and the service life of the safety bricks of other furnaces also gradually increased. The No. 4 molten iron furnace among them also created a record of reaching 320 furnaces in the recently concluded production cycle, entering the advanced ranks of the city's large molten iron furnaces.

When the factories establish model workers, they are closely combined with solving key production problems, so many outstanding technical bottlenecks are quickly broken through, and many advanced experiences are quickly promoted and implemented. Now, wherever there are difficulties, wherever the key is, model workers are established there. The operation of ventilation eyes, iron tap plugging, and slag tapping on molten iron furnaces are key to prolonging furnace life, maintaining furnace temperature, and improving the melting rate. These tasks are very difficult, and the operating requirements are accurate and strict; now, model workers have been established in these positions. They strictly and accurately implement operating procedures, setting a good example for the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, September 18th: A red flag competition movement centered on high yield, high quality, low consumption, and safe production has been enthusiastically launched in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company. Workers around the company's production increase and economy plan, each group has set specific targets, everyone has a key topic to tackle, and they are making great efforts in technical innovation and technical revolution everywhere, and holding daily evaluations, so that steel production has risen rapidly. In September, in addition to the main equipment being overhauled in the first five days, the average daily output of steel and iron from the 6th to the 15th increased by 20.44% and 12.38% respectively compared with the same period in August, creating the highest record this year, and the quality pass rate also reached 98% and 96% or more respectively.

In the competition, organizations at all levels mobilize the masses every week to discuss and formulate advanced plan targets that can be achieved through hard work, so that everyone has a goal to strive for and can show their skills in the competition. Therefore, from production departments to auxiliary departments, from steel workers to living service personnel, everyone is boosting their enthusiasm and striving to be the first, making this competition movement more universal and in-depth than any previous one, both enthusiastic and solid.

Now, before going to work every day, workers discuss the plan for the day at the pre-shift meeting, study ways to tackle the key, make great efforts in technical innovation and technical revolution, and exchange advanced experiences in a timely manner to promote continuous improvement in production levels. Chen Liang and Zhao Baozhong groups of No. 1 electric furnace and No. 2 electric furnace in the electric furnace steelmaking workshop calculated that they must each increase the production of one furnace of steel to complete the daily production increase plan when they were on duty on the 9th. After the two groups studied the measures, they started the competition as soon as they went to work. When smelting the first furnace of steel, the Chen Liang group adopted the method of patching the furnace and charging materials in cross operation, shortening the production auxiliary time by eight minutes; the Zhao Baozhong group promoted the advanced experience of "salt desulfurization," shortening the steelmaking time by twenty minutes. After the initial evaluation results were announced, the Chen Liang group immediately held a pre-furnace meeting and vigorously pursued, implementing the innovative measures of "early slag making" and "rational oxygen blowing" when smelting the second furnace of steel, shortening the steelmaking time by twenty-six minutes. Hearing the news, the Zhao Baozhong group immediately sent people to No. 1 electric furnace to learn from experience, and improved the operation of "manual collapse of materials," creating the method of "zoning collapse of materials," which shortened the time by twenty-four minutes compared with the first furnace of steel. On this day, both groups achieved their competition conditions, overfulfilling the production increase and economy plan by 9% for the whole day. On the 13th, the workers of Class B of No. 1 blast furnace created a new record of 90 batches of charging materials per shift. Then, the workers of Class A surpassed Class B with a new achievement of 96 batches of charging materials per shift. After Class C took over, the workers immediately made a technical analysis of the blast furnace smelting situation. In the past, the workers of various groups outside the furnace were called the "nurses" of the blast furnace, and their task was limited to doing a good job in the operation of their own positions. Now, the workers actively analyze the smelting situation inside the furnace, acting as both "nurses" and "doctors." The furnace workers judged that the furnace was cold based on the color of the molten iron slag liquid and immediately reported it to the duty room. At this time, the hot blast furnace workers also reported to the duty room that the hot air temperature could still be increased. The duty foreman Liu Xiaozhen immediately studied with them and increased the blast furnace wind temperature. As a result, the whole class unloaded 102 batches of materials, breaking the record of Class A and Class B again. The worker competition member Liu Ming, who was in charge of the competition, immediately went to the hero's stage and posted another new good news, reporting the good news that the red flag of this blast furnace changed hands three times a day. This blast furnace, which was only recently overhauled, has overfulfilled the production increase and economy plan for four consecutive days after shift-by-shift competition.

While carrying out internal competition, each department and each type of work also launched collaborative competition between departments and processes. Transportation, repair, and testing workers have served to the front of the furnace, cooperating with steel workers in production. The gate of the material warehouse of No. 3 blast furnace failed, affecting the charging speed. The repair technician Han Bingyu, who participated in the labor here, immediately sent a group to repair it. The testing workers also vigorously carried out rapid analysis, so that the steel workers could judge the smelting situation in a timely and correct manner. When they sent the good news of high production to No. 3 blast furnace, the furnace chief excitedly praised the testing workers for bringing them "a pair of more sharp eyes." When the converter steelmaking workshop was the most tense, the four converters were successively tapping steel, and the crane could not handle it. The shift leader, the crane group leader, and two dispatchers jointly dispatched the crane to cooperate with the tapping, slag removal, and iron water loading in a timely manner. When the molten iron furnace could not supply materials, the furnace repair workers and slag cleaning workers took the initiative to help transport materials, and the logistics personnel also sent meals to the site. The converter steelmaking workshop has overfulfilled the production increase plan in eight of the recent ten days.

In this fiery competition upsurge, nearly 10,000 workers who hold various management positions are constantly calculating the completion of the various indicators listed by each group, assisting the masses to fully complete the plan from all aspects, and achieving high quality and low consumption while maintaining high production. Zhang Chengkui, the steelmaking worker who serves as the group quality supervisor, and the workers of the group not only use the method of observing the flame to judge the quality of the steel, but also take slag samples and steel samples for judgment before tapping steel, and check the preparation of the steel water bag and the steel ingot mold, and do not produce steel without assurance. This group has continuously produced more than 400 furnaces of high-quality steel in the past month or so. Li Tingquan, the charging worker of No. 3 blast furnace who serves as the group accountant, calculates in detail the various expenses of each month. He found that the lubricating oil used in the winch room accounted for 70% of the monthly expense plan, so he studied with the workers of the whole group and quantitatively refueled the equipment according to the furnace temperature and the number of charging batches, so that the group's expenses in August were reduced by 7% compared with the production increase and economy plan. The slag ditch overpass of No. 1 blast furnace was burned out. Yang Xuefang, the furnace worker who was selected as the safety officer, immediately used the sand bed in front of the furnace to cast an overpass, making the operation convenient and production safe for the workers of the whole furnace.

In the competition, the company has established an evaluation system at each level. Groups are evaluated shift by shift, factories are evaluated day by day, and the entire company is evaluated once a week, so that the red flag competition becomes a mass movement that is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

The employees of the company are now riding the wind and waves and continuing to move forward, determined to greet the National Day with even more outstanding achievements.

    人人争做红旗手　竞赛一浪高一浪　生产持续大增长
    上海钢铁战线大树标兵
    石钢红旗竞赛深入展开决心用出色成绩迎国庆
    新华社上海19日电　上海各钢铁厂在增产节约运动中树立起大批标兵，促进你追我赶的竞赛热潮一浪高过一浪地向前发展，从而推动了钢铁生产的持续跃进。9月份以来，全市钢产量继续大幅度上升。
    在竞赛中大插红旗、大树标兵、人人争做红旗手，是上海钢铁战线群众运动更加深入发展的标志。今年以来，全市各钢厂的厂与厂、车间与车间竞赛活动从未间断。全市五大转炉车间之间，五天一小评，一月一大评，力争上游的气氛特别热烈。各厂内部，炉与炉、班与班、工段与工段、小组与小组之间的竞赛更是热火朝天。全市钢产量一跃再跃，新纪录一个接一个出现。8月份，各厂学习追赶全市标兵炉——上钢三厂第二转炉车间一号化铁炉，将竞赛运动推到了一个新的阶段。各厂认真推广了一号化铁炉“政治上炉前”的经验之后，广大职工革命自觉性进一步高涨，上下左右大协作的共产主义风格越来越高，红旗炉、红旗工段、红旗小组和红旗突击手（标兵），越来越多。在制砖、砌炉、上料、运件、小火车、卷扬机、仓库以及科室等各部门、各岗位上，都是标兵成列。上钢一厂、上钢三厂等几个大的钢铁厂，8月份经过群众评比，就树立了三千二百多名标兵，他们在不同的岗位上，同广大群众一起，积极带头苦干、实干和巧干，有的提高了熔化率，有的缩短了吹炼时间，有的进一步提高了质量，并且使许多先进水平很快成为普遍的水平。现在上钢三厂第一化铁炉和第二转炉车间的三号化铁炉，一厂第二转炉车间一号化铁炉，第三转炉车间四号化铁炉等炉的熔化率和去硫率，都已接近或赶上标兵一号化铁炉的水平。
    大插红旗、大树标兵运动，是发动群众人人做政治思想工作、鼓动工作的重要方面。评选标兵时，不但比操作、比技术，而且比思想、比风格、比协作，因而更能激励士气、鼓舞斗志，更能增强各工种之间的团结和协作。上钢一厂第二转炉车间一号化铁炉被评为车间标兵炉以后，当炉子晚期发生“结铁”毛病时，上料工人守候在料线旁看料线，料场工人精心为化铁炉进行“粗料细作”；炉前工人坚持勤通风眼，保持风眼只只圆亮畅通。所有工人为爱护集体荣誉，不辞辛苦地工作，使这只炉子的熔化率、去硫率和炉龄一直保持较高的水平。获得全国小型平炉高产红旗的上钢一厂平炉车间，职工们在竞赛中，班班评比，天天评比，及时克服缺点，发扬优点，把车间主要先进经验总结归纳成三十四条，点滴不漏地推广到生产中去，因而使每炉钢的冶炼时间进一步缩短，9月份以来一般只有四小时三十分左右。
    各厂、各车间不仅在先进水平中间插红旗，同时注意在后进的车间、工段、小组中间抓先进苗头，大树标兵，使人人有对象可赶，个个有标兵好学。这样就更促进了后进赶先进，形成不断出现后来居上的新气象。市冶金局所属的一个钢铁厂的转炉车间，8月份以前生产比较落后，化铁炉熔化率低。后来，车间领导干部发现六号化铁炉保险砖用了六十三炉还不坏，领导干部和工人群众就将六号炉树为标兵炉。当时部分干部认为，有些厂化铁炉保险砖使用寿命已超过一百炉了，六十三炉算啥红旗炉。但是，车间领导方面坚持在六号炉上插红旗，因为六十三炉的水平是当时这个车间具体条件下的先进水平。树立红旗炉后，更促进了群众竞赛的开展。工人群众一方面认真学习兄弟厂的先进经验，一方面从多方面帮助自己的标兵炉首先突破技术关键，积累操作经验。这样做的结果，六号炉保险砖寿命很快从六十三炉上升到更高水平，其它炉子保险砖使用寿命也逐渐上升；其中的四号化铁炉在最近结束的一个生产周期内，还创造了炉寿达到三百二十炉的纪录，进入了全市大型化铁炉的先进行列。
    各厂大树标兵时，紧紧结合解决生产关键问题，因而许多突出的技术关键很快被突破，很多先进经验迅速得到推广和贯彻。现在哪里有困难、哪里是关键，哪里就树立起标兵。化铁炉上通风眼、堵铁口、流渣操作，是延长炉子寿命、保持炉内温度、提高熔化率的关键，这些工作很艰苦，操作要求准确、严格；现在，这些岗位上都树立了标兵。他们严格、准确地执行操作规程，为群众树立了好榜样。
    新华社18日讯　一个以高产、优质、低耗和安全生产为中心的红旗竞赛运动，已经在石景山钢铁公司热烈展开。工人们围绕着全公司的增产节约计划，组组都订立了具体指标，人人都有攻打关键的课题，到处大闹技术革新和技术革命，并且天天举行评比，使钢铁产量迅速上升。9月份，除头五天主要设备进行检修以外，6日至15日钢、铁的平均日产量分别比8月同期提高了20.44％和12.38％，创造了今年以来的最高纪录，质量合格率也分别达到了98％和96％以上。
    竞赛中，各级组织每周都发动群众讨论和制定经过努力可以达到的先进计划指标，使人人都有奋斗目标，都能在竞赛中大显身手。因此从生产部门到辅助部门，从钢铁工人到生活服务人员，个个大鼓干劲，人人奋勇争先，使这次竞赛运动比以往任何一次都更加普遍和深入，既热烈又扎实。
    现在，工人们每天上班以前，都在班前会上讨论当天计划，研究攻打关键的办法，大闹技术革新和技术革命，及时交流先进经验，促使生产水平不断提高。电炉铸钢车间一号电炉陈亮和二号电炉赵保忠两个小组，在9日当班的时候，计算出必须各增产一炉钢，才能完成全日的增产计划。两个小组研究了措施以后，一上班就展开了竞赛。炼第一炉钢的时候，陈亮小组采取了补炉、装料交叉作业的办法，使生产辅助时间缩短了八分钟；赵保忠小组推广了“食盐脱硫”的先进经验，使炼钢时间缩短了二十分钟。初评结果宣布以后，陈亮小组立即举行炉前会，奋起直追，炼第二炉钢的时候，实行了“提前造渣”和“合理吹氧”的革新措施，使炼钢时间缩短二十六分钟。赵保忠小组闻讯立即派人到一号电炉学习经验，并且改进“人工塌料”的操作，创造了“分区塌料”的方法，又比第一炉钢缩短了二十四分钟。这一天两个小组都实现了自己的竞赛条件，全日超额9％完成了增产节约计划。一高炉乙班工人13日创造了每班上料九十批的新纪录，接着甲班工人又以每班上料九十六批的新成绩超过乙班。丙班接班以后，工人们立即对高炉冶炼情况作了技术分析。过去炉外各个小组的工人被称作高炉的“护士”，任务只限于作好本岗位的操作。现在工人们主动分析炉内的冶炼情况，既当“护士”又当“大夫”。炉口工人根据铁水渣液的颜色，判断出炉内较冷，立即到值班室报告，恰好这时热风炉工人也向值班室反映热风温度还可以提高，值班工长刘晓珍立即同他们一起研究，提高了高炉风温，结果全班下料一百零二批，又刷新了甲乙两班的纪录。管竞赛的工人竞赛员刘铭立刻走到英雄台前，贴出另一张新的喜报，向人们报道这个高炉红旗一日三易人的喜讯。这个不久前才检修的高炉，经过班班竞赛，已经连续四天超额完成了增产节约计划。
    各单位在开展内部竞赛的同时，各个部门和各个工种也展开了部门之间和工序之间的协作竞赛。运输、修理、化验工人，纷纷服务到炉前，配合钢铁工人生产。三号高炉的料仓闸门失灵，影响上料速度，在这里参加劳动的修理技师韩秉玉立即派来一个小组加以修理。化验工人也大搞快速分析，使钢铁工人及时正确判断冶炼情况。当他们把高产喜报送到三高炉的时候，炉长兴奋地称颂化验工人给他们带来了“一双更加锐利的眼睛”。转炉炼钢车间最紧张的时候四座转炉接连出钢，天车忙不过来，值班长、天车组长和两名调度员共同调度天车，及时配合出钢、运渣和装铁水。化铁炉供不上料，修炉工、清渣工主动来帮助运料，后勤人员也把饭菜送来现场。转炉炼钢车间在最近的十天中，有八天超额完成了增产计划。
    在这个如火如荼的竞赛热潮中，担任各种管理员职务的近万名工人，时刻计算着各小组所列各项指标的完成情况，从各方面协助群众全面完成计划，在高产的同时作到了优质、低耗。担任小组质量监督员的炼钢工张成奎同小组的工人不仅用观察火焰的方法判断钢的质量，而且在出钢前取渣样和钢样进行判断，检查钢水包和钢锭模的准备情况，不出无把握的钢。这个小组最近一个多月来连续生产了四百多炉优质钢。担任小组核算员的三高炉上料工人李廷全，详细计算每月的各项费用。他发现卷扬机室所用的润滑油占全月费用计划的70％，便同全组工人研究，根据炉况温度和上料批数给设备定量加油，使小组8月份的费用比增产节约计划降低了7％。一高炉渣沟过桥烧坏了，被选为安全员的炉前工杨学方，立即利用炉前的砂床铸了一个过桥，使全炉工人操作方便，生产安全。
    这个公司在竞赛中，逐级建立了评比制度，小组班班评比，厂级日日评比，全公司一周一评比，把工人的劳动成果及时公布出来，使红旗竞赛成为一个深入人心的群众运动。
    这个公司职工，现在正乘风破浪继续前进，决心用更加出色的成绩迎接国庆节。
