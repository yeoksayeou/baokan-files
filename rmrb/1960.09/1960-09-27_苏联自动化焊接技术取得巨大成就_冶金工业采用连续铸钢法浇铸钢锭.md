Xinhua News Agency, Moscow dispatch: According to Soviet newspapers, the Soviet Union has recently made great achievements in welding technology. In terms of the level of automation of welding work, the Soviet Union is now the first in the world.

There are now about 12,000 automatic and semi-automatic arc welding machines and more than 40,000 resistance welding machines in various sectors of the Soviet national economy, which is far more than any other country in Europe. In terms of the scale of mechanized arc welding, the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States. At present, in the construction of Soviet trunk pipelines, the automation level of pipeline welding has reached 70%, while in other countries it is only 5%-10%.

The Soviet Union also has many new creations in welding methods and welding technology. In addition to the well-known electric slag welding method, glue welding is also widely promoted in the Soviet Union. The firmness of the welds made by this method is one to two times higher than that of welds made by ordinary welding methods.

Latvian scientists have developed a welding method. According to this method, any ductile metal can be welded with a special press without additional heating, and the firmness of the weld even exceeds the firmness of the weldment itself.

Recently, experts from the Ukrainian Electric Welding Institute and the Chelyabinsk Steel Pipe Plant jointly created a new electric welding method. Using this method to weld gas pipes with a diameter of 82 centimeters, the welding speed can reach 210 meters per hour, which has never been achieved in European countries and the United States.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to TASS, Stalino: The scale of using continuous steel casting method to cast steel ingots in Soviet industry has greatly exceeded that of other countries.

At present, there are already six sets of continuous steel casting devices in the Soviet metallurgical industry. Not long ago, an automated continuous steel casting device at the Stalino Steel Plant was put into production. Its production capacity is unmatched in the world. The entire production cycle takes only 40 to 60 minutes, which is half to one times faster than casting steel ingots by ordinary methods. The steel casting bucket of this device can hold 40 tons of molten steel, which is more than twice the volume of the largest steel casting bucket of existing continuous steel casting devices abroad.

Using the continuous steel casting method to cast steel ingots can save a lot of funds. The "Red Sormovo" Steel Plant in Gorky saved 3.5 million rubles in 1959 alone by using this method to cast flat steel ingots for steel plates and section steel.

　　苏联自动化焊接技术取得巨大成就
　　冶金工业采用连续铸钢法浇铸钢锭
    据新华社莫斯科讯　据苏联报纸报道，最近时期，苏联在焊接技术方面取得了很大的成就。在焊接工作的自动化水平方面，苏联现在已经居世界第一位。
    苏联国民经济各部门中现在约有一万二千台电弧焊接自动机和半自动机、四万多台接触电焊机，这大大超过了欧洲任何一个国家。就电弧机械化焊接的规模来说，苏联已超过了美国。目前，苏联干线管道的敷设工作中，管道焊接的自动化水平已达70％，而其他国家不过是5％—10％。
    苏联在焊接方法和焊接技术上也有很多新的创造。除了久已闻名的电力矿渣焊接法以外，胶焊法也在苏联广泛推行，用这种方法焊接的焊缝，其牢固程度比一般焊接法焊接的焊缝高一倍到两倍。
    拉脱维亚科学家研究出了一种焊接方法。根据这种方法，凡是有可塑性的金属不必另外加热就可以用专门的压力机进行焊接，其焊缝牢固程度还超过焊件本身的牢固程度。
    最近，乌克兰电焊研究所和车里雅宾斯克钢管厂的专家共同创造了一种新的电焊方法。用这种方法焊接直径为八十二厘米的瓦斯管，其焊接速度每小时可以达二百一十米，欧洲各国和美国从来还没有达到过这样高的速度。
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社斯大林诺讯：苏联工业中采用连续铸钢法浇铸钢锭的规模，已经大大超过其他国家。
    现在，苏联冶金工业中已经有六套连续铸钢装置。不久以前斯大林诺钢铁工厂有一套自动化连续铸钢装置投入生产，它的生产能力是举世无匹的，整个生产周期只用四十到六十分钟，比用普通方法浇铸钢锭要快半倍到一倍。这套装置的铸钢桶能装四十吨钢水，比外国现有连续铸钢装置的最大铸钢桶的容积大一倍以上。
    用连续铸钢法浇铸钢锭可以节约很多资金。高尔基市的“红色索尔莫沃”钢铁厂由于用这种方法浇铸制钢板和型钢用的扁钢锭，在1959年一年中就节约了三百五十万卢布。
