Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 12th: According to Soviet press reports, the vast number of workers on the steel and mining industry front in the Soviet Union have been continuously creating new production records and new production achievements this year, striving to produce more steel and iron ore for the country.

    In the steel industry bases across the Soviet Union, blast furnaces burn day and night, and steelworkers are striving to exceed the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan this year, producing at least 2.9 million tons more steel and a large amount of pig iron for the country, bringing pig iron production to over 47 million tons, and steel production to break through the 60 million ton mark for the first time, reaching around 65 million tons. At the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, the largest metallurgical industrial enterprise in the Soviet Union, workers at the No. 2 blast furnace have already greatly surpassed the level of labor productivity in the United States last year. Since the beginning of this year, they have continued to increase smelting speed, and even completed their annual increased production guarantee ahead of schedule in April, producing 6,000 tons of pig iron for the country above the plan. Open hearth furnace workers are constantly breaking production records. In May, they created the shortest empty furnace (empty furnace after tapping) record in the Soviet Union, shortening the empty furnace time for every 400 to 500 heats of steel from the past three to seven days to two to six days, thereby accelerating steel production. Steelworkers Tvorogov, Kochagin, and others smelted an average of 10.75 tons of steel per square meter of overloaded open hearth furnace area in July, creating the highest all-Soviet and worldwide record for overloaded open hearth steelmaking. At the Nizhny Tagil Iron and Steel Works in the Urals, steelworkers in the No. 1 open hearth furnace workshop are also constantly climbing new production peaks. The Zashliapin team and the Obraztsov and Ploskonenko teams completed the annual target for over-planned steel production ahead of schedule by June 8th. In total, they produced 1.5 times more steel for the country in the first five months than they had produced over the plan for the entire year last year. Steelworkers at the Cherepovets Iron and Steel Works, an important steel industry center in the northwestern region of the Soviet Union, also recently completed the annual task of over-planned pig iron production ahead of schedule. In August, they reduced the utilization coefficient of the effective volume of the blast furnace from 0.588 in the first half of the year to 0.542, breaking the original highest record in this regard in the entire Soviet Union and all Western countries.

    The Soviet Union's total iron ore production has already greatly exceeded that of the United States last year, ranking first in the world. In order to support the development of the steel industry with more raw materials, Soviet iron ore workers will further push the total iron ore production from 94.4 million tons last year to a new height of over 100.5 million tons this year. Since the beginning of this year, the mining speed in the Krivoy Rog iron ore region (in Ukraine) has been accelerating every day. By the beginning of August, the miners had already created four production records. In January, the Denisenko fast tunneling team of the Liebknecht Mine first created the highest record for flat tunnel excavation in the Soviet Union, tunneling 403.4 meters in the entire month. In April, the Rostani team of the Dzerzhinsky Mine broke the previous record, tunneling 421.8 meters in the entire month. In July, the Kachura team of the "20th Party Congress" Mine, due to improved labor organization, created an even higher record, bringing the monthly tunneling speed to 441 meters. In early August, the miners of the famous "Giant" mine in this mining area created the highest record for labor productivity in the entire Soviet mining industry. They extracted an average of 52 tons of iron ore per worker in one work shift (six hours), which also greatly exceeded the level achieved by the best iron ore mines in the United States and France. In the Kazakh Republic, the red star was also lit on the top of the drilling machine of the Leninogorsk Mine in East Kazakhstan on August 27th, telling people that the miners here had completed the original production task of the Seven-Year Plan more than five years ahead of schedule. Currently, the average daily iron ore extraction for the steel industry in various iron ore regions of the Soviet Union is about 280,000 tons. The No. 2 blast furnace of the Kazakhstan Magnetic Anomaly Zone in the Kazakh Republic is under construction.

### 苏联钢铁生产战线不断出现新纪录  钢铁工人力争今年钢产量超过六千万吨

    苏联钢铁生产战线不断出现新纪录
    钢铁工人力争今年钢产量超过六千万吨
    新华社莫斯科12日电　据苏联报刊报道：钢铁、采矿工业战线上的苏联广大职工，今年来不断创造新的生产纪录、新的生产成就，努力为国家生产更多钢铁和铁矿砂。
    苏联各地钢铁工业基地上炉火日夜熊熊不息，钢铁工人们力争在今年超过七年计划控制数字，最少要多为国家冶炼二百九十万吨钢和大量生铁，使生铁产量达到四千七百万吨以上，使钢产量第一次突破六千万吨大关，达到六千五百万吨左右。在苏联最大的冶金工业企业——马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂，二号高炉的工人去年已使劳动生产率大大超过美国的水平。今年以来，他们继续提高了冶炼速度，还在4月间就提前完成了他们今年全年的增产保证，为国家超计划生产了六千吨生铁。平炉工人更不断刷新生产纪录，他们在五月间创造了苏联最短的空炉（出钢后的空炉）纪录，使每炼四百至五百炉钢的空炉时间由过去的三至七昼夜缩短为二至六昼夜，从而加速了钢的生产。炼钢工人特沃罗戈夫、科查金等人在7月间平均从每平方米超负荷平炉面积上冶炼了十点七五吨钢，创造了超负荷平炉炼钢的全苏联和全世界最高纪录。在乌拉尔的下塔吉尔钢铁联合工厂，第一平炉车间的炼钢工人也在不断攀登新的生产高峰。扎什梁平工作队以及奥布拉佐夫、普洛斯科年科等工作队到6月8日这一天就提前完成了超计划产钢的全年指标，总计头五个多月为国家多生产的钢比去年全年超计划生产的钢还多一点五倍。苏联西北地区重要钢铁工业中心切列波维茨钢铁工厂的炼钢工人也在最近提前完成了超计划生产生铁的全年任务。他们在8月份把高炉有效容积利用系数从今年上半年的零点五八八降低到零点五四二，突破了全苏联和所有西方国家这方面原有的最高纪录。
    苏联的铁矿砂总产量已在去年大大超过美国，而居世界第一位。为了以更多的原料支援钢铁工业的发展，苏联铁矿工人今年将进一步把铁矿砂总产量从去年的九千四百四十万吨推向新的高度——一万零五百万吨以上。今年以来，克里沃罗格铁矿区（在乌克兰）的采矿速度每天都在加快，到8月初矿工们已经连创了四个生产纪录。在1月间，李卜克内西矿井的杰尼谢科快速掘进队首先创造了全苏平巷掘进最高纪录，全月掘进了四百零三点四米。4月间，捷尔任斯基矿井的罗斯达尼工作队突破前一纪录，全月掘进了四百二十一点八米。7月间，“二十次党代会”矿井的卡楚拉工作队由于改进了劳动组织，结果又创造了更高的纪录，使全月掘进速度达到四百四十一米。在8月初，这个矿区著名的“巨人”矿山的矿工又创造了全苏联采矿工业劳动生产率的最高纪录。他们在一个工作班（六小时）内，平均每个工人要开采五十二吨铁矿砂，这也大大超过了美国和法国最好的铁矿所达到的水平。在哈萨克共和国，东哈萨克斯坦的列宁诺戈尔斯克矿山的钻探机顶上于8月27日也亮起了红星，它告诉人们这里的矿工已经提前五年多完成了七年计划原订的生产任务。目前苏联各铁矿区平均每天已经可以为钢铁工业开采约二十八万吨铁矿砂。苏联哈萨克共和国哈萨克斯坦磁力区的二号高炉正在建造中。（附图片）
