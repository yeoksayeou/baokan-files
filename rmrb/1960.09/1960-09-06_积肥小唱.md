    Little Song of Manure Collection
    Zeng Chuanjing, Longnan, Jiangxi

    The grass of July is gold, the grass of August is silver.
    Brothers and sisters go to the mountains to collect manure,
    Songs rise everywhere in the deep mountains.
    The mountains are covered in green grass, the nests are full of tender fertilizer,
    Brothers and sisters swing their sickles to cut grass,
    Collecting manure to increase production fills them with energy.

    Brothers and sisters cut grass for fertilizer, like swallows flying,
    Swallows circling around the green mountains,
    The mountains are full of grass fertilizer piled high.

    Cut the grass from the mountains, good fertilizer for the late rice seedlings,
    Brothers and sisters sing songs down the mountain,
    To make the barren fields yield gold.

    积肥小唱
    江西龙南　曾传景七月草是金，八月草是银，哥妹积肥走上山，深山处处起歌声。山山百草青，窝窝草肥嫩，哥妹挥镰把草割，积肥增产满身劲。哥妹割草肥，好似燕子飞，燕子绕着青山转，满山草肥堆打堆。割下山上草，好肥晚禾苗，哥妹唱歌下了山，要让瘦田出金宝。
