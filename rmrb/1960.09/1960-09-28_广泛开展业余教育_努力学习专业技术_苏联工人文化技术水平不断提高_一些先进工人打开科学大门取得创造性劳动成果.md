Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 27th: According to Soviet press reports: In the Soviet Union, approximately 2.5 million workers master new professions each year, more than 5 million further improve their professional skills, and more than 4 million study in general schools, technical schools, and universities without interrupting their work. These figures show that Soviet workers are constantly striving to improve their cultural and technical level.

Due to the widespread development of amateur education, workers not only improve their own professional skills but also master a variety of technologies. According to the results of surveys conducted in five enterprises in different industrial sectors, 31% to 44% of workers have mastered two professions, and 12% to 23% have learned three or more professions. At the Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical Combine, more than half of the workers can perform several jobs concurrently. A Communist Youth League youth work team of the Gorlovka City Housing Construction Project Trust, due to everyone mastering several skills, greatly improved work efficiency and quality, completing at least 170% of the plan each month, and is therefore welcomed everywhere.

Workers have opened the door to science in production and study and have achieved creative labor results. Workers at the Upper Pyshma Electrolytic Copper Plant, together with scientists from the Ural Polytechnic Institute, jointly developed a new method for obtaining powdered copper and stabilizing it. Because this method is newly created in chemical technology, they won the Mendeleev First Class Prize. Innovator workers at the Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical Combine, with the assistance of scientific workers, created a new layout diagram for the complete automation of open hearth furnace heat treatment. Advanced workers in Sverdlovsk enterprises have written many books, pamphlets, and papers on science and technology. For example, Ponomarev, a gear milling worker at the Ural Machine-Building Plant, wrote a manual for gear milling workers, and worker Makhonzev wrote a book introducing the advanced experience of turning workers.

Soviet workers are not only limited to improving their technical level but also care about learning. According to a survey conducted by the editorial department of "Banner of Lenin" among one hundred workers at the Kolomna Heavy Machine Tool Plant, these one hundred workers read two hundred and four various newspapers. Eighty of them read several new books every month. At the same time, workers account for a large proportion of students attending cultural universities, for example, reaching 60% in the Sverdlovsk region.

Now, many factories have formulated seven-year plans to further improve the cultural and technical level of workers.

    广泛开展业余教育　努力学习专业技术
　　苏联工人文化技术水平不断提高
    一些先进工人打开科学大门取得创造性劳动成果
    新华社莫斯科27日电　据苏联报刊报道：苏联现在每年有大约二百五十万工人掌握新专业，五百多万人进一步提高自己的业务水平，四百多万人不脱产地在一般学校、技术学校和高等学校学习。这些数字说明，苏联工人正在不断努力提高自己的文化和技术水平。
    由于业余教育的广泛开展，工人们不仅提高了本行业务，而且掌握了多种技术。根据在不同工业部门的五个企业进行的调查结果，31％到44％的工人掌握了两种专业，12％到23％的工人学会了三种或三种以上的专业。下塔吉尔冶金联合厂半数以上的工人能兼做几种工作。戈尔洛沃城住宅建设工程托拉斯的一个共青团员青年工作队由于人人掌握几种技能，大大提高了工作效率和质量，每月至少完成计划170％，因而到处受到欢迎。
    工人们在生产和学习中打开了科学的大门，并且取得了创造性的劳动成果。上皮什马电解铜厂的工人同乌拉尔工学院的科学家共同研究出了一种获得粉状铜并加以稳定化处理的新方法。由于这个方法在化学工艺学中是新创的，他们荣获了门德雷叶夫一等奖金。下塔吉尔冶金联合厂的工人革新者在科学工作者的协助下，创造出了平炉热处理全盘自动化新配置图。斯维尔德洛夫斯克企业的先进工人写出了不少有关科学技术的书籍、小册子和论文。例如，乌拉尔机器制造厂的齿轮铣工波诺马列夫写成了一部齿轮铣工手册，工人麦洪泽夫写成了一部介绍旋工先进经验的书。
    苏联工人并不仅局限于提高技术水平，而且关心学习。据“列宁旗帜报”编辑部在科洛姆纳重型机床制造厂的一百个工人中间进行的调查，这一百名工人阅读着二百零四份各种报纸。其中八十人每月要读几本新书。同时，在文化大学听课的学员中，工人所占的比例也很大，例如，在斯维尔德洛夫斯克州达到60％。
    现在，许多工厂都拟定了进一步提高工人文化和技术水平的七年计划。
