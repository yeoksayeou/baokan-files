Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, September 28th: On the eve of National Day, officers and soldiers of the three services on the Fujian Front wrote letters to their relatives on the industrial and agricultural production and construction fronts, congratulating them on the great achievements they have made in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, focusing on grain and steel, and thanking them for their care and concern for the frontline troops.

　　The officers and soldiers of the 3rd Company of a certain artillery unit, who had been awarded the collective third-class merit for their performance in the artillery battles, wrote a National Day congratulatory letter to all the workers of the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel, warmly congratulating the steelworkers for recently attacking the key to production, shortening the smelting time of each furnace of steel, and achieving the great victory of producing 100 to 600 tons more steel per day. The letter said: "When we hear your production news from newspapers and radios, we jump for joy, because we know that producing one more ton of steel means one more point of strength in defending peace." After hearing the good news that the Huang Jiguang Youth Fast Tunneling Team of the Zhugemiao Coal Mine in Pingdingshan, Henan Province, had increased the monthly footage by 66.5% in August compared to July, and that September was also a daily red banner, the soldiers of the 3rd Platoon of a certain artillery company immediately wrote to congratulate the fast tunneling team, encouraging them to maintain their honor, carry forward their honor, and create even greater production achievements.

　　These days, the soldiers have also been writing to the people's commune members who are vigorously developing agriculture and grain production to greet the National Day. The soldiers of the radio squad of a certain unit said in a letter to the Weiken Jinpen Lake Production Team of the Huayang People's Commune in Wangjiang County, Anhui Province: "Originally, Jinpen Lake was a place where there was heavy flooding in heavy rain, minor flooding in light rain, and drought when there was no rain, and the harvest was not guaranteed. Under the leadership of the commune Party committee, you turned the barren lake into paddy fields with the spirit of overwhelming mountains and seas, and produced a large amount of grain for the country. We are learning from your spirit of overcoming nature and improving our skills to defend the motherland."

　　The young officers and soldiers of various units also wrote letters to express their respect to the young people who left the cities and participated in rural construction. Dai Xue, a gunner of a certain naval gunboat, enthusiastically praised Xing Yanzi for her broad vision and great ambition in his letter to the Xing Yanzi Assault Team of the Sijiazhuang Production Team of the Zhongzhuang People's Commune in Hebei Province, for staying in the countryside and working with the people of the whole village to change the face of the poor team and build a new socialist countryside. The telephone squad of the 2nd Company of a certain artillery unit said in a festival congratulatory letter to Wang Yulan, the leader of the East Wind Ten Sisters Assault Team of the Shantang People's Commune in Teng County, Shandong Province, who insisted on rural production, that your spirit of loving the countryside, wholeheartedly serving the community and the collective, practicing diligence and thrift, and striving for self-improvement, is worth learning from. Let us contribute our beautiful youth to the defense and construction of the motherland in different posts.

    福建前线官兵国庆节前夕纷纷写信
　　祝工农战线的巨大成就
    据新华社福建前线28日电　国庆节前夕，福建前线三军官兵纷纷写信给祖国工、农业生产建设战线上的亲人，祝贺他们在以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中取得的巨大成就，并感谢他们对前线部队的关怀和慰问。
    在炮战中立过集体三等功的炮兵某部第三连的官兵，在写给鞍钢第二炼钢厂全体职工的国庆节贺信中，热烈祝贺钢铁工人最近猛攻生产关键，缩短每炉钢的熔炼时间，取得每天多产钢一百到六百吨的伟大胜利。信中说：“当我们从报纸上和收音机旁听到你们的生产捷报时，都高兴得跳起来，因为我们知道多生产一吨钢，就多一分保卫和平的力量。”炮兵某连第三排的士兵，听到河南省平顶山诸葛庙煤矿黄继光青年快速掘进队，为了保证钢铁生产不断跃进，8月份月进尺比7月份猛增66.5％，9月份又是日日红的喜讯后，立即写信祝贺这个快速掘进队，勉励他们保持荣誉，发扬荣誉，创造更大的生产成绩。
    这几天，战士们也纷纷写信给正在大办农业，大办粮食迎接国庆的人民公社社员。某部无线电班的战士在写给安徽省望江县华阳人民公社围垦金盆湖生产队的信中说：“原来金盆湖是大雨大涝，小雨小淹，不雨即旱，收成没有保障的地方。你们在公社党委的领导下，以排山倒海的精神，把荒湖变成了稻田，为国家生产出大批粮食。我们正在学习你们战胜自然的精神，提高本领，保卫祖国。”
    各部队的青年官兵还写信向离开城市，参加农村建设的青年表示敬意。海军某炮艇瞄准手戴学在给河北省钟庄人民公社司家庄生产队邢燕子突击队的信中，热情赞扬邢燕子眼光开阔，胸有大志，留在农村，和全村人民一起，为改变穷队面貌，建设社会主义新农村做出了成绩。炮兵某部第二连电话班在写给坚持农村生产的山东滕县山亭人民公社东风十姐妹突击队的队长王玉兰的节日贺信中说，你们热爱农村，一心为社、为集体，克勤克俭，发愤图强的精神，值得我们学习。让我们在保卫祖国和建设祖国不同的岗位上贡献我们美好的青春。
