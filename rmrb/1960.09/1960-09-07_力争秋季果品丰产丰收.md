Strive for a Bumper Harvest of Autumn Fruits
    By People's Daily Commentator

Fruits are a non-staple food in the lives of the broad masses of people, as well as a raw material for the food processing industry and an important national export commodity. Striving to increase fruit production can both meet the needs of the people's lives and support national construction. It is currently the peak growing season for autumn fruits, and we should make every effort to strengthen orchard management and strive for a bumper harvest of autumn fruits this year.

Autumn fruit production plays a very important role in the year's total fruit production, accounting for about two-thirds or more of the total annual output. Major fruits such as apples, citrus, and pears in autumn fruits are not only of good quality and resistant to storage and transportation, but are also the main fruits to supply the autumn market, as well as the main fruits to supply the winter and next spring markets. Therefore, strengthening autumn orchard management and striving for a bumper harvest of autumn fruits is of particular importance.

In the first half of this year, orchard management work in various places was generally better than in previous years. The growth and fruiting of fruit trees in most parts of the country is vigorous, which has laid a good foundation for striving for a bumper harvest of autumn fruits this year. However, there are still two to three months from now until the main fruit harvesting season. During this period, fruits may still be subjected to natural disasters such as windstorms, frosts, and diseases and insect pests. Therefore, only by continuously strengthening orchard management and overcoming various natural disasters can we achieve a bumper harvest of autumn fruits.

In a year, the growth of fruit trees can be roughly divided into two stages: spring is the period of branch and leaf growth, flowering and fruit setting; autumn is the period of fruit enlargement and differentiation of flower buds and formation of fruit branches for some fruit trees. Grasping the current critical period of rapid fruit enlargement and strengthening fertilizer and water management in orchards will not only have a significant effect on increasing production in the current year, but also lay the foundation for increasing fruit production next year. According to experiments in Hunan Province in 1959, the weight of citrus fruits increased significantly when multiple topdressing and irrigation were used during the fruit enlargement period, and the fruit increased by 11.8% compared with those without strengthened later management. Apples, pears, citrus and other fruits still have two to three months before the harvest season. During this period, we should focus on increasing the application of fruit-strengthening fertilizer, combined with drainage, irrigation, and cultivation and weeding, and pay attention to disease and pest control. All localities should seize the opportunity to apply a comprehensive application of quick-acting fruit-strengthening fertilizer. In dry areas, fertilizer application should be combined with irrigation. In waterlogged areas, accumulated water should be drained first, and then fertilizer should be applied, combined with cultivation and weeding to loosen the soil.

Continuing to carry out disease and pest control is the main link to ensure fruit yield and quality. All localities should first make forecasts of insect conditions, seize favorable opportunities, and carry out timely prevention and control. In addition, we must do a good job in preparing for harvesting, and carry out harvesting in batches to achieve large fruits, good quality, and high yields.

In recent years, many new orchards have been developed in various places, and the number of young trees is very large. This is a new force in fruit tree production. We should take practical measures to do a good job in the management of young trees and strive to achieve the requirements of fruiting in three years and achieving full production in five years.

At present, all kinds of farm work are very busy. Leading departments at all levels should pay attention to rationally arranging labor, implement the "three guarantees and one reward" system, and strengthen fruit tree management while managing food crops well, and strive for a bumper harvest of autumn fruits.

    力争秋季果品丰产丰收
    本报评论员
    果品，是广大人民生活中的一种副食品，也是食品加工工业的原料和国家重要的出口物资。努力增加果品生产，既可以满足人民生活的需要，又可以支援国家建设。目前正是秋季果品生长旺盛时期，我们应该千方百计加强果园管理，力争今年秋季果品大丰收。
    秋季果品生产在全年果品生产中占很重要的地位，其产量约占全年总产量的三分之二以上。秋季果品中像苹果、柑桔、梨等主要水果，品质既好，又耐贮存和运输，不仅是供应秋季市场需要的主要水果，而且也是供应冬季和明年春季市场需要的主要水果。所以，加强秋季果园管理，争取秋季果品丰收，具有特别重要意义。
    今年上半年，各地果园管理工作一般比往年开展得好，全国大部分地区果树生长和结果是旺盛的，这给争取今年秋季果品丰收，已经打下良好的基础。但是，从现在到主要果品采收时期，尚有两三个月，在这期间内果品仍可能遭受风灾、霜冻、病虫等自然灾害的侵袭，因此，只有不断加强果园管理，战胜各种自然灾害，才能取得秋季果品丰收。
    一年之中，果树生长大体上可分为两个阶段：春季是果树枝叶生长和开花座果时期；秋季是果实膨大和部分果树花芽分化和果枝形成时期。抓住当前果实迅速膨大的关键时期，加强果园的肥培管理，不仅对当年增产有显著效果，而且可以为明年果品增产奠定基础。据湖南省1959年试验：壮果期间采用多次追肥和灌水，柑桔果实体重有显著增加，同未加强后期管理的相比，果实增大11.8％。苹果、梨、柑桔等果品距采收时期尚有两三个月，在这个时期，应以增施壮果肥为中心，结合排水、灌溉和中耕、除草，并注意病虫防治工作。各地要抓紧时机全面施一次速效性壮果肥，干旱的地区在施肥的同时要结合灌水，受涝的地区应先排除积水，然后追施肥料，结合中耕除草，疏松土壤。
    继续开展病虫防治工作，是保证果品产量和质量的主要环节，各地应先作好虫情预报，抓住有利时机，及时防治。另外，要做好采收准备工作，分期分批进行采收，以达到果实大，质量好，丰产又丰收。
    近几年来，各地发展了不少新果园，幼树数量很大，这是果树生产中的一支新生力量。我们应该采取切实措施，做好幼树的管理工作，争取达到三年结果，五年丰产的要求。
    目前，各种农活都很忙，各级领导部门要注意合理安排劳力，贯彻三包一奖制，在管好粮食作物的同时，加强果树管理，争取秋季果品丰产丰收。
