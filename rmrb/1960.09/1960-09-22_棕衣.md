　　Palm-Fiber Raincoat
　　Xiǎo Bái
　　This is a dual-purpose cold-weather and rain-proof garment woven from palm fibers by Red Army soldiers.

　　During the Long March, the Red Army faced daily reconnaissance and bombing from dozens of enemy aircraft in the sky, and encirclement and interception by hundreds of thousands of enemy troops on the ground. They encountered countless hardships and obstacles along the way. Look, they had no cloth, no cotton, and no fur. They used locally produced palm fibers to weave unique palm-fiber raincoats to overcome rain, snow, and bitter cold. As Chairman Mao depicted in his poem "The Long March," the Red Army soldiers, with the heroic spirit of "count[ing] nothing the myriad mountains and rivers," overcame unimaginable difficulties. In twelve months, each person traveled over 20,000 li on foot, traversing eleven provinces, and victoriously concluded the Long March under the leadership of Chairman Mao.

　　This palm-fiber raincoat is a revolutionary heirloom. Who can see this palm-fiber raincoat without being moved by the revolutionary optimistic spirit of the Red Army soldiers' arduous struggle! Let us pass on the Red Army's style of work from generation to generation! (Attached image)

    这是红军战士用棕编织的防寒御雨两用衣。
    长征路途中的红军，天上每日有敌人几十架飞机侦察轰炸，地上有几十万敌军围追堵截，路上遇着了说不尽的艰难险阻。请看，他们没有布，没有棉，也没有皮毛，就用当地出产的棕编织出奇特的棕衣来，战胜了雨雪严寒。这正如毛主席的七律《长征》中所描绘的那样，红军战士们以“万水千山只等闲”的英雄气概，克服了难以想像的种种困难，在十二个月的时间里，每人用两只脚，长驱二万余里，纵横十一个省，跟着毛主席胜利地结束了长征。
    这件棕衣是一件革命的传家宝，谁看到这件棕衣不为红军战士艰苦奋斗的革命乐观的精神所感动！我们让红军作风代代相传下去吧！（附图片）
