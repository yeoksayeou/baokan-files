Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 19th: Radio Pathet Lao Combat Forces broadcast today that the Preparatory Committee of the Joint Struggle Committee for Peace, Neutrality, and National Harmony in Sam Neua Province issued a statement supporting the Phouma government's policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, and stating that it would fight alongside the people to overthrow the Phoumi Nosavan clique.

The members of the Preparatory Committee of the Joint Struggle Committee for Peace, Neutrality, and National Harmony in Sam Neua Province include representatives of various nationalities, troops, and administrative organs from the Kingdom side, the Lao Patriotic Front, and other patriotic parties.

The preparatory committee held a meeting on September 16. The head of the preparatory committee said that the policies of the Joint Struggle Committee for Peace, Neutrality, and National Harmony are: to fully agree with the peace, neutrality, and national harmony policies of the Souvanna Phouma government; to thoroughly support the realization of the above-mentioned policy line of the Phouma government; to firmly cooperate with the people and the patriotic army of the Kingdom, and to completely overthrow the rule of the traitorous Phoumi Nosavan clique, the running dogs of U.S. imperialism, in Sam Neua Province.

The head of the preparatory committee denounced to some cadres, Kingdom military officers, and people from all walks of life attending the meeting the crimes of the U.S. imperialist running dogs in violating the Geneva Accords, carrying out "sweeps" one after another in Sam Neua Province, massacring patriots, arresting hundreds of people, burning villages and houses, and plundering the people's property in large quantities. He said that the people of Sam Neua Province are extremely angry at the actions of these reactionaries and are determined to rise up against them.

The head of the preparatory committee also said that the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le overthrew the Somsanith-Phoumi government and established the Phouma government, which declared a policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony. The people of Sam Neua Province are extremely excited about this, hoping that the government will bring peace and national harmony to the people of Sam Neua Province and the people of the whole country. However, the troops of the Phoumi Nosavan clique in Sam Neua Province are stubbornly opposed to the Phouma government's policy line and continue to carry out terrorist "sweeps," arresting and shooting Lao Patriotic Front members and Lao people. From August 9 to the present, they have carried out five "sweeps," arresting twenty-two people. They have also clamored to occupy Sam Neua Province as a springboard for overthrowing the Phouma government and attacking Vientiane.

The head of the preparatory committee said that at present, the people of Sam Neua Province, with unparalleled anger, have unanimously risen up to fight against the reactionary running dogs of U.S. imperialism. Patriotic staff and soldiers in various counties have also participated in the above-mentioned struggle. Many places have been freed from the rule of the Phoumi Nosavan reactionary clique. The head of the preparatory committee said that the people of Sam Neua Province will contribute to peace and national harmony, to the realization of the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and to Laos' policy of peace and neutrality.

　　坚决同美帝国主义走狗作斗争
    支持富马政府实现和平中立和民族和睦政策
    新华社河内19日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天广播：桑怒省和平中立和民族和睦联合斗争委员会筹备委员会发表声明，支持富马政府的和平中立和民族和睦政策，并且表示，将同人民一起，为打倒富米·诺萨万集团而斗争。
    桑怒省和平中立和民族和睦联合斗争委员会筹委会的成员包括：王国方面、老挝爱国战线党以及其他爱国党派的各民族、部队和行政机构的代表。
    9月16日筹委会召开了会议。筹委会负责人说，和平中立和民族和睦联合斗争委员会的政策是：完全同意梭发那·富马政府的和平中立、民族和睦的政策；彻底支持富马政府上述政策路线的实现；坚定地同人民和王国爱国军队紧密合作，并且在桑怒省彻底推翻美帝国主义走狗富米·诺萨万叛国集团的统治。
    筹委会的负责人向参加会议的一些干部、王国军官和各界人士，控诉了美帝国主义走狗破坏日内瓦协议，在桑怒省接二连三地进行“扫荡”，惨杀爱国者，逮捕成百人民，烧毁村庄和房子，大量掠夺人民财产的罪行。他说，桑怒省人民对这些反动分子的行动无比愤怒，并坚决起来反对他们。
    筹委会的负责人还说，以贡勒大尉为首的政变委员会推翻了松萨尼特—富米政府，成立富马政府，这个政府宣布奉行和平中立、民族和睦政策。桑怒省人民对此感到无比兴奋，希望政府将给桑怒省人民和全国人民带来和平和民族和睦。但是在桑怒省的富米·诺萨万集团的军队死心蹋地反对富马政府的政策路线，继续进行恐怖“扫荡”，逮捕和枪杀老挝爱国战线党党员和老挝人民。仅从8月9日到现在，他们共进行了五次“扫荡”，逮捕二十二人。他们还扬言要占领桑怒省，作为推翻富马政府、攻打万象市的跳板。
    筹委会负责人说，目前，桑怒省人民怀着无比愤怒的心情，一致起来同美帝国主义反动走狗们展开斗争。各县爱国职员和士兵也参加了上述斗争。许多地方已经摆脱了富米·诺萨万反动集团的统治。筹委会负责人说，桑怒省人民将为和平和民族和睦，为实现祖国的和平统一和老挝的和平中立政策作出贡献。
