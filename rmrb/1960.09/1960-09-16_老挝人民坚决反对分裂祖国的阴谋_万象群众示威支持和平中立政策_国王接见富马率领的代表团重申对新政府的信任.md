He delivered a speech at the rally, saying that the government hopes to realize the King's aim of unity among the Lao people. He emphasized that everyone must understand that splitting the country is a matter of life and death for the motherland. He said he would send representatives to Luang Prabang to negotiate with the "Revolutionary Committee" in Savannakhet.

After the meeting, the masses held a demonstration.

Another report from Vientiane Radio on the 14th stated that the Lao Civil Servants' Federation recently sent a resolution to the Lao government, stating that the Federation thoroughly supports the Kingdom Government, opposes acts that split the country and disrespect the law, and supports a genuine policy of peace and neutrality and peaceful coexistence.
