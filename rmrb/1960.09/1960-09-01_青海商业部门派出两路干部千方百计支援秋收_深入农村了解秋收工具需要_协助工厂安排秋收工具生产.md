(Our dispatch from Xining, September 31st) The commercial front in Qinghai Province has transferred a large number of cadres, dividing them into two groups to advance deeply into the front lines of agricultural and industrial production. They are organizing the production, transfer, and supply of autumn harvest farm tools, striving by every possible means to meet the needs of the autumn harvest.

This year, the harvest area of autumn crops in Qinghai Province has increased by about one time compared to last year. The demand for autumn harvest farm tools in various regions has not only increased many times over but also requires a wider variety, better quality, complete sets, and higher work efficiency. To ensure supply in terms of quality, quantity, and time, the province's commercial departments, under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, drew out over 60% of their cadres as early as one quarter prior and formed two large teams to delve into the production front lines, focusing on the supply of autumn harvest farm tools. One team went deep into rural people's communes and production teams, eating, living, and working alongside the masses. They used methods such as visiting homes, holding field discussions, and calculating detailed accounts to understand the needs of communes and production teams for autumn harvest farm tools, and helped formulate procurement and usage plans for farm tools. The other team went deep into factories, and based on the needs of the autumn harvest, they coordinated with relevant departments by holding industry-commerce symposiums and signing supply and sales contracts to arrange farm tool production. To enable these two teams to launch separate attacks while also coordinating with each other, many county commercial bureaus also established autumn harvest support headquarters, and central stores established command groups. Through extensive contact between commercial staff and industrial and agricultural production departments, and vigorous organization of farm tool production, the total value of autumn harvest farm tools supplied from July 1st to August 20th this year increased by 1.9 times compared to the same period last year, with harvesters alone increasing by four times.

After going deep into the factories, the cadres of the Qinghai Provincial Commercial Department actively participated in the factories' production. In organizing the production of farm tools, they grasped both "foreign" and "local"; both large and small; both semi-mechanized and mechanized farm tools, as well as old-fashioned iron, wood, and stone farm tools, resulting in a significant increase in the variety of autumn harvest farm tools this year, and the production of a large number of new farm tools suitable for the different needs of deep mountainous areas, low mountainous areas, and river valley areas. At the same time, commercial departments in various regions also focused on key issues in production and vigorously helped factories solve difficulties in raw materials, technology, blueprints, and samples. They vigorously purchased scrap iron and steel and old timber, ensuring the supply of raw materials for the production of autumn harvest farm tools.

In order to provide more and better farm tools for the autumn harvest, commercial departments in various regions, combined with the mass technical innovation and technical revolution movements, further assisted local industries and commune-run industries in creating and imitating various high-efficiency farm tools. The Xining Municipal Commercial Bureau transferred carpenters, ironworkers, electricians, and fitters from its system to form a technical innovation institution, producing urgently needed rapid harvesters, winnowing machines, threshing machines, and the like for the autumn harvest. After the Gonghe County Commercial Department learned about the members' opinions on farm tools, it promptly reported them to the local agricultural machinery factory and jointly studied them with the factory, creating hand-pushed harvesters and foot-operated threshers, which generally increased work efficiency by eight to ten times. In July, the Minhe County Commercial Department helped factories arrange and produce a large number of windmills and ball bearings, making the work efficiency of autumn harvest transportation and threshing tools higher, and saving a lot of labor and animal power.

While firmly grasping the organization of sources of goods inside and outside the province, commercial departments at all levels in Qinghai Province adopted the method of producing, purchasing, transferring, and supplying simultaneously, and cooperated extensively with grain, banking, industry, transportation and other departments to deliver goods to the countryside in batches, ensuring that materials arrived before the season. By mid-August this year, the autumn harvest farm tools in the eastern Huangshui and Yellow River basin areas had been basically transferred; the transfer time of autumn harvest farm tools in pastoral areas was also one month earlier than last year. Many farmers and herdsmen, because the autumn harvest area had increased this year, were originally afraid that harvesting would be difficult and timely completion would be impossible. Now, seeing a large number of various farm tools being transported early, they couldn't help but smile and thank the industrial and commercial workers for their support. Duo Ji Cailang (Tibetan), director of the Jiarang Commune Central Store in Jianzha County, braved the rain and crossed three mountains overnight to transport more than 200 farm tools to the countryside in time. After receiving these urgently needed autumn harvest farm tools, the farmers and herdsmen were so excited that they held his hand tightly for a long time.

While ensuring the supply of autumn harvest farm tools, commercial departments in various regions also coordinated with industrial and agricultural units to organize professional farm tool repair teams, carrying various parts to help repair and assemble a large number of farm tools.

    青海商业部门派出两路干部千方百计支援秋收
    深入农村了解秋收工具需要
    协助工厂安排秋收工具生产
    本报西宁31日电　青海省商业战线抽调大批干部分两路进军，深入农业、工业生产第一线，组织秋收农具的生产、调运和供应工作，千方百计地满足秋收需要。
    今年青海省秋收农作物的收获面积比去年增加了一倍左右，各地对秋收农具的需要量不仅成倍增长，而且要求的品种多、质量好、配套齐、工效高。为了保证按质按量按时供应，全省商业部门在各级党委统一领导下，早在一个季度以前就抽调了约60％以上的干部组成两支大军深入生产第一线，狠抓秋收农具的供应工作。一支大军深入农村人民公社、生产队，和群众同吃同住同劳动，用登门访问、田间座谈、算细账等办法，了解公社、生产队对秋收农具的需要情况，帮助制订了农具的购置和使用计划。一支大军深入工厂，根据秋收的需要，协同有关部门用召开工商座谈会，签订供销合同的办法，安排农具生产。为了使这两支大军既能分头出击，又能相互配合，不少县商业局还成立了支援秋收指挥部，各中心商店成立了指挥小组。通过商业职工与工农业生产部门广泛联系和大力组织农具生产，今年7月1日到8月20日供应的秋收农具总金额，比去年同时期增加了一点九倍，其中仅收割机就增加了四倍。
    青海省商业部门干部在深入工厂以后，都积极参与工厂的生产。在组织农具生产中，既抓“洋”的，又抓“土”的；既抓大的，又抓小的；既抓半机械化机械化农具，又抓旧式的铁木石农具，因而使今年秋收农具的品种大大增加，生产出了大批适合深山区、低山区及川水地区不同需用的新农具。同时，各地商业部门还针对生产中的关键问题，大力帮助工厂解决原材料、技术、图纸和样品的困难。他们大力收购废钢铁、旧木材，保证了生产秋收农具的原材料的供应。
    为了给秋收提供更多更好的农具，各地商业部门结合群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，进一步协助地方工业、社办工业创制、仿制出了各种高工效的农具。西宁市商业局抽调本系统的木工、铁工、电工和钳工组成一个技术革新机构，生产出秋收急需的快速收割机、扬场机、脱谷机等。共和县商业部门了解了社员对农具的意见以后，及时反映给当地的农业机械厂，并与厂方共同研究，制成了手推收割机、脚踏脱粒机等，一般可提高工效八至十倍。民和县商业部门在7月份帮助工厂安排和生产了大批风车和滚珠轴承，使秋收运输、打碾等工具的工效更高，节省大量劳力和畜力。
    青海省各级商业部门在抓紧组织省内外货源的同时，采取边生产、边收购、边调运、边供应的办法，与粮食、银行、工业和交通运输等部门大搞协作，成批送货下乡，做到了季节未到，物资先行。今年8月中旬，东部湟水、黄河流域地区的秋收农具已基本调运完毕；牧业区秋收农具的调运时间也比去年提早了一个月。许多地区的农牧民因为今年秋收面积增大，原来怕收割难以及时完成，现在见到大批各式农具提早运到，不禁眉开颜笑，感谢工商业职工对他们的支援。尖扎县加让公社中心商店主任多吉才郎（藏族）连夜冒雨翻过三座大山，把二百多件农具及时运送到农村，农牧民接到这些急需的秋收农具后，激动得紧紧拉住他的手久久不放。
    在保证秋收农具供应的同时，各地商业部门还协同工业农业等单位组织了专业的农具检修队，携带各种零件帮助修配了大批农具。（附图片）
