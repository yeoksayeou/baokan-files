Xinhua News Agency, Nanning. Guangxi is launching a mass movement to prevent and control field pests. At present, some areas have basically controlled the spread of pests.

Since mid-August, Guangxi has had more rainfall. Some areas have experienced varying degrees of pest damage. In order to eliminate pests in their early stages, various localities immediately launched mass pest control movements. After Guiping County discovered pests in late rice, it quickly organized pest control teams to carry out a comprehensive sweep. From August 18th to 20th, Hechi County organized a group of cadres and commune members, divided into districts with individual responsibility, to conduct a sudden inspection of the pest situation, checking and treating them simultaneously. On the evening of August 18th, Wuxu Commune set up many oil lamps and torches to lure and kill pests. On the morning of the 19th, they sprayed 666 powder, lime, and indigenous pesticide solution. By August 20th, the county had eradicated pests over 95% of the affected area. Bobai County regarded pest control as an outstanding task in field management, organized forces, divided responsibility areas, assigned individual responsibility, and launched a sudden encirclement and annihilation campaign. Currently, all pest-affected rice fields in the county have been treated once. Rong County applied topdressing fertilizer in time after pest control to ensure that both pesticides and fertilizers were applied universally, so not only were pests eliminated, but the rice seedlings also recovered quickly. According to the farm inspection of Xian Di Commune, after the farm adopted the combined method of pesticide and fertilizer application on the 40 mu of rice seedlings that were most severely affected, the mortality rate of pests reached more than 95%, and new leaves sprouted on the rice seedlings after three days, restoring their original growth.

In pest-affected areas, all walks of life actively supported the pest control movement. After Hechi County discovered pests, the county's commercial departments allocated insecticides such as "666," "1059," and DDT in time to supply the pest-affected areas of the commune. After hearing about the pests in late rice, the store employees of Zhangmu Commune in Yulin County immediately cleared the warehouse and delivered the stored "666" powder to each team overnight, and in one day they treated more than 3,000 mu of late rice once. Now, the late rice seedlings in this commune are lush green.

Nanjing, September 2nd (By Our Own Correspondent) "Kill one more insect, grow one more ear of rice." The people's communes in Suzhou Prefecture, mainly focused on late rice, seized the critical opportunity, with greater enthusiasm, and launched the second battle against stem borers to prevent white ears of late rice and ensure an over-production of autumn grain.

In mid-August, Suzhou Prefecture launched the first battle against stem borers, mainly focused on medium rice planted later, and achieved significant results, greatly reducing the damage of stem borers. At present, most of the early-planted late rice is about to head, and ant borers are also hatching in large numbers. It is the critical period for the larvae to drill into the rice hearts and cause white ears. The people's communes seized the critical period and launched the second battle against stem borers with greater enthusiasm than the first battle. Many places have also launched mass summaries and inspections to learn from the experiences and lessons of the first battle.

In order to meet the larger-scale second battle, all localities have strengthened leadership, organized prevention and control teams, further prepared sufficient pesticides, and repaired pesticide machinery. The entire region trained 200,000 pest control backbones this summer. Through the practical exercises of the first battle, the number was expanded to 250,000 in the second battle. By strengthening leadership and rectifying the organization, the Guli Commune in Changshu County increased the daily labor force from 400 to 4,500 people, and the pest control effect was several times higher than in the past. The supply of pesticides was also increased to fully meet the needs of prevention and control. After August 25, the district's commercial departments transferred one million catties of 666 powder from other places and quickly allocated them to the production teams.

In the second battle, all localities learned from the experience of the previous battle, grasped the key points, and worked hard and skillfully to fight accurately and fiercely. The late rice and double-cropped rice were inspected and ranked block by block, and pesticide prevention and control were carried out in batches according to the heading time to ensure that the right medicine was prescribed, neither letting go of a stem borer nor wasting pesticides. Generally, to prevent white ears of late rice, 666 powder is added to water and poured. To prevent dead heart seedlings of double-cropped late rice, 666 pesticide-containing soil is sprinkled, and the insecticidal effect is very good.

At the critical moment of preventing and controlling stem borer damage, cadres at all levels personally went into battle, divided up areas of responsibility, participated in the battle, and commanded the battle. Lu Renfu, the secretary of the Lüdu Commune in Kunshan, led the production team cadres and technicians deep into the fields to check for stem borers, observe the seedling situation, eradicate weeds first, and then apply pesticides. The 13,000 mu of late rice in the entire commune were treated in three batches, and the double-cropped late rice seedlings were treated once every five days. Wenlin Commune in Jiangyin County sent out 32 cadres to 14 large teams to specifically direct pest control, achieving three leadership roles, namely, taking the lead in preparing pesticides, taking the lead in spraying pesticides, and taking the lead in maintaining quality, to ensure the complete victory of the stem borer control battle.

    开展群众性运动力保农作物不受损害
    广西突击歼灭田间虫害
    苏州专区总结经验加强领导抓紧消灭稻螟虫
    据新华社南宁讯　广西各地掀起防治田间虫害的群众运动。目前有些地区已基本控制了害虫的蔓延。
    8月中旬以来，广西雨水较多。一些地区发生了不同程度的虫害。为了把害虫消灭在幼龄阶段，各地立即开展群众性的除虫灭虫运动。桂平县发现晚稻有害虫后，迅速组织了除虫队伍，全面扫荡。河池县从8月18日到20日，全县组织了一部分干部和社员，分片包干，突击检查虫情，边检查，边除治。五墟公社8月18日晚上，设置了多盏油灯和火把，进行诱杀扑捉。19日早上，又喷撒了六六六粉、石灰和土农药水。全县到8月20日，灭除虫害面积已达受害面积的95％。博白县把灭虫当作田间管理中的突出工作来抓，组织力量，划分责任区，分工包干，突击围歼。目前全县受虫害的稻田已全部防治一遍。容县在除虫后，都及时施了追肥，做到药肥普施，因此不仅扑灭了虫害，禾苗也得到迅速复原。据县底公社农场检查，这个场在对受害最严重的四十亩禾苗采取药肥兼施办法后，害虫死亡率达95％以上，而且三天后，禾苗已抽新叶，生长恢复原状。
    在虫害发生地区，各行各业都积极支援除虫运动。河池县发现有虫害后，县的商业部门就调拨“六六六”、“一○五九”以及滴滴涕等杀虫药，及时供应公社的虫害区。玉林县樟木公社的商店职工，听到晚稻有虫害后，立即清理仓库，把库存的“六六六”粉连夜送到各小队，一天内就把三千多亩晚稻虫害除过一次。现在，这个公社的晚稻禾苗已一片葱绿。
    本报南京2日电　“多灭一条虫，多成一条穗”，苏州专区以晚稻为主的各人民公社，抓住关键时机，以更大干劲，开展治螟第二战役，防止晚稻白穗，确保秋粮超产。
    苏州专区在8月中旬，以晚栽的中稻为主，开展了治螟的第一战役，取得了显著的成果，大大减低了螟虫的危害。目前，大部分早栽的晚稻快要抽穗，蚁螟也在大量孵化，正是幼虫钻稻心、造成白穗的紧要时期，各人民公社抓住关键时期，以比第一个战役更大的劲头，开展了治螟第二战役。许多地方还开展了群众性的总结检查，吸取第一战役的经验教训。
    为了迎战规模更大的第二战役，各地都加强了领导，组织了防治队伍，进一步备足了农药，整修了药械。全区在今年夏季训练了二十万个治虫骨干，通过第一战役的实践锻炼，在第二战役中扩大到二十五万人。常熟县古里公社通过加强领导，整顿组织，每日投入劳力由四百人增至四千五百人，治虫效果比过去成几倍地提高，对农药也增加了供应，充分满足防治需要。专区商业部门在8月25日后，又从外地调运了六六六粉一百万斤，迅速调拨到各生产队。
    在第二战役中，各地都吸取前一战役的经验，掌握关键，猛攻巧干，打准打狠。对晚稻和双季稻进行逐块检查排队，根据抽穗先后，进行分期分批喷药防治，做到对症下药，既不放过一个螟虫，又不浪费农药。一般防止晚稻白穗，用六六六粉加水泼浇，防治双季晚稻枯心苗，用六六六农药毒土撒施，杀虫效果很好。
    在防治螟害的紧要关头，各级干部都亲自上阵，划片包干，参加战斗，指挥战斗。昆山绿葮公社书记陆仁福带领生产队干部和技术员深入田间，查螟虫，看苗势，先莠先打药，全社一万三千亩晚稻，先后分三批防治，对双季晚稻苗隔五天打一次。江阴县文林公社抽出干部三十二人，分头到十四个大队具体指挥治虫，做到了三带头，即带头配药、带头喷药、带头坚持质量，保证治螟战斗的彻底胜利。（附图片）
