    In the face of reactionary enemies who are ten or a hundred times stronger, as long as we adhere to the revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism, we will be invincible, no matter how bad the conditions or how harsh the environment.
    In the face of arduous and challenging socialist construction tasks, as long as we adhere to the revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism, we will be invincible even if the foundation is "poor and blank."
    In the struggle to conquer nature, as long as we adhere to the revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism, we will be invincible even in the face of peaks like Mount Everest or floods that occur once in a century.
    So, what about in the face of disease? What about in the face of tuberculosis or various chronic illnesses? Comrade Deng Yingchao's speech answered this question: as long as we adhere to the revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism, we can greatly enhance the curative effect.
    Overcome disease with a revolutionary spirit! Only revolutionaries can put forward such a slogan, and only revolutionary proletarian fighters can do so. Overcoming disease with a revolutionary spirit can only become a reality when Marxism has armed people's minds, the communist spirit has inspired people's will, and the socialist system has created the necessary conditions for people's health. In order to rescue sixty-one class brothers from critical condition, the people from Beijing to Pinglu displayed such a noble communist style! In order to rescue worker brother Qiu Cai Kang from incurable burns, the people of Shanghai wrote such brilliant poems!
    With a revolutionary spirit, people will not be intimidated by illness and will overcome it ideologically. The reason why Qiu Cai Kang was able to come back to life was due to the people of Shanghai displaying a high degree of communist style and making every effort to rescue him; it was also due to Qiu Cai Kang himself having an extraordinary revolutionary willpower, never losing confidence in his own life and health. Only by first establishing a revolutionary spirit, believing that a cure is certain, and combining fully leveraging subjective initiative with medical measures, can we enhance our physical fitness and win health for the cause of communism. Conversely, if one is frowning all day long, overwhelmed with sorrow, shedding tears in the wind, and grieving at the moon, even with the best medical conditions, one may not be able to overcome the disease.
    To overcome disease, medical treatment is an important factor, and treating disease with a revolutionary spirit is another important factor. Having a revolutionary spirit in turn promotes medical treatment to play its maximum role.

    把主观能动性和医疗措施结合起来
　　　陈思
    在十倍、百倍强大的反动敌人面前，只要我们坚持马克思列宁主义的革命精神，即使条件再坏，环境再苦，也是战无不胜的。
    在繁重艰巨的社会主义建设任务面前，只要我们坚持马克思列宁主义的革命精神，即使基础是“一穷二白”，也是战无不胜的。
    在征服大自然的搏斗中，只要我们坚持马克思列宁主义的革命精神，即使像珠穆朗玛那样的高峰，像百年不遇那样的洪水，也是战无不胜的。
    那么，在疾病面前呢？在肺结核或者这样那样的慢性病面前，又怎样呢？邓颖超同志的讲话，回答了这个问题：只要我们坚持马克思列宁主义的革命精神，也就可以大大增强疗效。
    用革命的精神战胜疾病！只有革命者才能提出这样的口号，只有革命的无产阶级战士才能这样去做。用革命的精神战胜疾病，只有在马克思主义武装了人们的头脑、共产主义精神鼓舞了人们的意志、社会主义制度又为人们的身体健康创造了必要的条件，才有可能成为现实。为了从病危中抢救六十一个阶级弟兄，从北京到平陆的人们，发扬了多么崇高的共产主义风格！为了从不治的烫伤中抢救工人兄弟丘财康，上海的人民写下了多么灿烂的诗篇！
    有了革命精神，人们就能够不被病魔所吓倒，从思想上战胜它。丘财康之所以能起死回生，是上海人民发扬了高度的共产主义风格，全力抢救；也是由于丘财康自己有着非凡的革命意志力，对自己的生命和健康，从没有失去信心。只有首先树立革命精神，相信一定能治好，把充分发挥主观能动性和医疗措施结合起来，就能够增强体质，为共产主义事业赢得健康。反过来，如果整天愁眉苦脸，不可终日，临风落泪，对月伤心，纵使有最好的医疗条件，也未必能战胜疾病的。
    战胜疾病，医疗是重要因素，用革命的精神对待疾病是另一个重要因素。有了革命精神又反转来促使医疗发挥最大限度的作用。
