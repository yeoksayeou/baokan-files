From our newspaper, Xi'an, September 17th: Members of the Xinfeng Commune in Lintong County, Shaanxi, are seizing the crucial opportunity to manage the fields, to rush through field management and harvest crops, to ensure early autumn ripening and strive for early and good autumn planting.
　　
The 100,284 mu of autumn fields planted by the Xinfeng Commune this year are generally growing well. However, due to less rain in the early stage and more rain in the later stage, the autumn fields have generally experienced excessive vegetative growth, posing a risk of delayed maturity. Failure to control this will affect the timely sowing of wheat. The Party branches of each production team have grasped the favorable situation in current production and mobilized the masses to discuss this crucial issue. During the discussion, the Wanli Production Team shared their experience from last year in promoting early maturity of 55 mu of corn, shortening the maturity period from 115 days to 98 days, achieving a yield of 180 jin per mu, while ensuring timely sowing of subsequent wheat crops. This year, the yield of this wheat crop reached 275 jin per mu. Conversely, the 30 mu of corn planted on the river滩, although with better land conditions, only yielded 175 jin per mu because no measures were taken to promote early maturity. The autumn crops matured late, and the wheat fields were sown ten days late, resulting in a yield of only 150 jin per mu this year. After the discussion, the commune members generally believed that, "Farming depends on seizing the right time, it is not too late now, it depends on how well we do it." The commune members specifically analyzed the conditions of each plot of land and proposed methods to promote early maturity. Cadres and veteran farmers of the Mingjia Production Team, based on their experience over the years, proposed methods of "one fertilizer for two uses" and "one hoe for two gains" to promote autumn crops. "One fertilizer for two uses" means increasing the amount of fertilizer applied to autumn fields in the later stage to raise the ground temperature and promote early maturity of corn. After harvesting, it can be turned over as base fertilizer for wheat fields, which can save labor and advance the time of wheat planting. "One hoe for two gains" means meticulous and deep hoeing, weeding and picking up weeds at the same time, which loosens the soil and clears weed roots and seeds for wheat sowing.
　　
As soon as these two methods came out, everyone praised them, and teams came to learn them. Soon, they spread throughout the commune. With clear main targets and endless good methods and measures, the commune members' confidence greatly increased, and their enthusiasm was high. A vigorous campaign to promote early autumn ripening was launched throughout the commune. Teams competed with teams, people competed with people, those doing the same work competed with each other, those fertilizing competed with those weeding, and those accumulating and delivering fertilizer competed with those fertilizing. The more they competed, the higher their enthusiasm, and the more methods were developed. The efficiency of each type of work was higher than ever before. The Zhujia Team and the Xiyan Team of the Sanyu Production Team were old rivals in competition. In this competition, they continued to compete fiercely. The members of the Zhujia Team discussed measures and prepared tools overnight. On the day of the competition, 85% of the full and semi-labor force of the team, a total of seventy-eight people, participated in autumn field management. Therefore, the progress of all types of work was at the forefront. The Xiyan Team, with better conditions in all aspects, saw that they were about to fall behind. Deputy Captain Yan Maocai, member Yan Shenggui, and others secretly went to the Zhujia Team's field for "reconnaissance," carefully inspecting the quality of the Zhujia Team's inter-tillage and fertilization. They believed that the Zhujia Team had indeed surpassed their own team, the weeding was meticulous, the fertilization was sufficient, and the quality was also better than their own. The situation was pressing, and the members of the Xiyan Team discussed and deliberated while working, and they came up with many ways to catch up with the Zhujia Team. In this way, the number of people participating in autumn field management doubled compared to before. In addition, quota management was implemented, and labor was rationally allocated according to the weight of the work and the level of technology. The next day, the fertilizing and inter-tillage efficiency of this team increased by more than double compared to before, catching up with the Zhujia Team.
　　
During the competition, the autumn field management movement on adjacent fields became even more intense. The 128 mu of corn of the Xiyan Team and the 69 mu of corn of the Zhujia Team were adjacent to each other from north to south. The Xiyan Team managed this corn meticulously, and the corn grew vigorously, with cobs as long as a foot. The Zhujia Team's corn, due to late planting and poor initial processing, was higher in the south and lower in the north, greener in the south and yellower in the north, thicker in the south and thinner in the north, compared to the Xiyan Team. In this situation, the Zhujia Team was not discouraged. They humbly learned from the experience of the Xiyan Team and mobilized 26 Party members, League members, and activists in the team to form a specialized group to focus on this corn, accelerate the speed of fertilization. Now, the corn stalks are strong and the leaves are green, as tall and good as the Xiyan Team's corn.
　　
In the movement to promote early ripening and high yield of autumn fields, cadres of the commune and management area have gone deep into the backward teams and established offices in the fields, which has greatly promoted the autumn field management movement of the backward teams. At the same time, in the competition, the communist spirit of advanced teams helping backward teams has been further promoted, ensuring the overall leap forward of the autumn promotion movement. The Wanzigou Team of the Sanyu Production Team fell behind in inter-tillage. After completing their own tasks, the Wangjia and Shahe Teams sent 20 laborers with tools to actively help the Wanzigou Team eliminate weeds, so that the backward caught up with the advanced.
　　
Currently, the competition to promote early ripening and high yield of autumn fields in the Xinfeng Commune is continuing to develop in depth. Advanced production teams are not complacent, and backward teams are not discouraged. Who wins and who loses cannot be determined at present. However, the effect of promoting early autumn ripening and high yield is very significant. According to investigations, late corn generally tassels two days earlier, and five days after processing, the corn cobs are about two inches away from the main stem. The barren stalk rate of corn has also decreased from 5% last year to 2%, and the double cob rate has increased from 40% last year to over 60%. It is estimated that late autumn can mature one week earlier, which provides ample time for timely sowing of wheat.

    促秋田早熟　争冬麦早种
    新丰公社争分夺秒突击管理晚秋作物
    本报西安17日电　陕西临潼县新丰公社社员，抓住当前争一时抢两季的关键时机，开展了争分夺秒的田间管理突击运动，促秋田早熟多收，争秋种种早种好。
    新丰公社今年播种的十万零二千八百四十亩秋田，目前普遍生长良好。但是，由于今年前期雨少，后期雨多，秋田普遍发生贪青现象，有推迟成熟的危险。如果不加控制，将会影响小麦的适时下种。各生产队党支部抓紧当前生产的有利形势，发动群众针对这一关键性的问题，进行了讨论。在讨论中，湾李生产队提出了他们去年对五十五亩玉米采取促早熟的经验，使这块玉米成熟期由一百一十五天缩短到九十八天，亩产一百八十斤，同时保证了回茬小麦适时下种，今年这块回茬小麦亩产达到二百七十五斤。与此相反，种在河滩的三十亩玉米，虽然土地条件好，就因为没有采取促早熟的措施，亩产才一百七十五斤，秋田熟的晚，麦田迟下种十天，今年亩产只有一百五十斤。经过讨论，社员们普遍认为，“务庄稼就在赶农时，现在时间不算晚，就要看干的怎样了。”社员们具体分析了每块地的情况，提出了促早熟的办法。明家生产队的干部和老农根据他们历年的经验，提出了“一肥两用”、“一锄两得”的促秋办法。“一肥两用”是加大秋田后期施肥量，提高地温，促玉米早熟，收获后，即可翻过作为麦田底肥，这样既能节省劳力，又能提前种麦时间。“一锄两得”是精细深锄，边锄草边拾草，这既疏松了土壤，又为麦田下种清除了草根、草籽。
    这两个办法一出来，人人说好，队队来学，很快就传遍了全社。主攻目标明确，好办法好措施层出不穷，社员们信心大增，干劲十足。一个促秋早熟的竞赛运动在全社轰轰烈烈地展开了。队与队赛，人与人赛，同活路的赛，施肥的和锄草的赛，积肥、送肥又和施肥的赛，越比干劲越高，办法越来越多，各工种效率一时高过一时。三育生产队的朱家小队和西严小队是竞赛的老对手。这次竞赛中，他们继续大比大赛。朱家小队的社员们连夜讨论措施，准备工具。在竞赛的当天，全小队85％的全半劳力共七十八人都参加了秋田管理。因此，各项活路进度都走在最前头。各方面条件较好的西严小队眼看就要落在后面，副队长严茂才、社员严生贵等暗里跑到朱家队地里进行了“侦察”，仔细地查看了朱家小队的中耕、施肥的质量。他们认为朱家小队的确超过了自己小队，草锄的细，施肥足，质量也比自己好。形势逼人，西严小队的社员一边劳动，一边议论，商量了许多赶朱家小队的办法。这样，参加秋田管理的人数比原来增加了一倍。并且实行了定额管理，按活路轻重、技术高低，合理搭配劳力。第二天，这个小队的施肥、中耕工效比原来提高一倍以上，赶上了朱家小队。
    在竞赛中，连畔地的秋田管理运动，更加激烈。西严小队的一百二十八亩玉米和朱家小队的六十九亩玉米南北连畔。西严小队对这块玉米管理细致，玉米生长茁壮，棒子足有一尺长。朱家小队的玉米，由于播种迟，前期加工不细，和西严小队相比，南畔高北畔低，南畔绿北畔黄，南畔粗北畔细，两种景色。就在这种情况下，朱家小队仍不灰心，虚心学习西严小队的经验，并且调动了队里的党、团员和积极分子二十六人编成专业组，专攻这块玉米，加快施肥速度，现在这块玉米株壮叶绿，和西严小队长的一般高，一样好。
    在促使秋田早熟多收的运动中，公社和管理区的干部都深入到后进队，并在田间建立了办公室，大大促进了后进队的秋田管理运动。同时在竞赛中，先进队帮助后进队的共产主义风格得到进一步发扬，保证了促秋运动的全面跃进。三育生产队湾子沟小队在中耕中落了后，汪家、沙河两个小队在完成自己的任务后，抽出二十名劳力带着工具，主动帮助湾子沟小队消灭草荒，使后进赶上了先进。
    现在，新丰公社的促使秋田早熟多收的竞赛运动正继续深入发展。先进生产队不自满，后进队不气馁，谁胜谁负目前还不能决定。但是，促秋早熟、多收的效果却非常显著。据调查，晚玉米普遍提前两天吐穗，加工后五天玉米棒就离开主秆二寸左右。玉米的空秆率也由去年的5％下降为2％，双棒由去年的40％增加到60％以上。预计晚秋可提前一周成熟，这给适时播种小麦提供了充裕的时间。
