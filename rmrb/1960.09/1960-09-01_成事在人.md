    Success Depends on Human Effort
    Gang Ren
    In "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," Zhuge Liang is depicted as a resourceful and influential figure. However, after his meticulously planned ambush in the Valley of Fallen Phoenixes, intended to annihilate Sima Yi, was ruined by rainfall, he became discouraged. He sighed and said, "Planning lies with man, success lies with Heaven, it cannot be forced!"—We will not attempt a comprehensive evaluation of Zhuge Liang for now; what we want to discuss is his notion that "success lies with Heaven." This idea seems to resonate with what we have observed in the current intense and arduous struggle against drought.
    Does "success" truly "lie with Heaven?" As dialectical materialists, we must first respect the facts. In the United Production Team No. 3 of the Tielu Management District of the Jian'su People's Commune in Hong'an County, Hubei Province, thirty-five mu of intermediate rice paddy were on the verge of drying up due to the drought. The distant water was unable to quench the immediate thirst, and some people were disheartened, saying, "It looks like what we are about to get cannot be harvested; there is really nothing we can do about the heavens!" Is this the case? The answer from Jiang Yanqiao, the secretary of the general branch of this management district, is negative: "Who says we can't harvest? We won't let a single grain be lost!" With determination, he immediately mobilized the masses, set up eight waterwheels, and took the lead in drawing water to fight the drought. Finally, the water climbed up to Hujiagang; finally, the grain was fully watered. As a result, those who were originally discouraged now had some joy: "When cadres take the lead, drought turns into no drought. People, after all, are more ruthless than heaven!" Practice yields truth: people have subjective initiative; therefore, in the final analysis, people are ultimately more ruthless than heaven. This scientific concept is a powerful refutation of the notion that "success lies with Heaven"; truth should be that success lies with "human effort," not "with Heaven."
    "Success depends on human effort" and "success depends on Heaven" may seem only a word apart, but they clearly mark two different worldviews: Are people ultimately slaves to nature, or masters of nature? Admittedly, humanity has not yet reached the point where it can command the heavens to rain or not to rain, so floods and droughts still bring us disasters. However, as humanity has developed to this day, in the process of fighting against nature, it has gradually come to know nature and master its laws, and thus has been able to control nature to a certain extent. To resign oneself to fate in the face of natural disasters is to be a complete slave to nature; to resolutely fight against natural disasters is to be the master of nature. Under the socialist system, especially with the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, we have a huge force to overcome natural disasters and can turn major disasters into minor ones, and minor disasters into no disasters. I remember Mayakovsky once wrote these famous lines of poetry:
    "We will surely have a good harvest,
    Earth,
    You must triple your output!"
    How much sense of ownership overflows within! Nature, you must bow your head and obey! In our great motherland, especially in the glorious era of the Great Leap Forward, this feeling has been sublimated. Do the Chinese working people still have that slave-like appearance of the past? No, they have become masters. "The working people on the nine million six hundred thousand square kilometers of the People's Republic of China have now truly begun to rule this land." (Chairman Mao: "Introducing a Cooperative") Therefore, success depends entirely on human effort!

    成事在人

    在《三国演义》上，诸葛亮是个足智多谋、叱咤风云的人物。可是，上方谷一役，当他所精心设计的火歼司马懿的圈套，遭到天雨的毁坏之后，竟也泄气了。喟然叹曰：“谋事在人，成事在天，不可强也！”——对于诸葛亮，我们暂且不去全面评价他；现在我们所要议论的，就是他的这种“成事在天”的说法。因为这种说法，在目前紧张艰巨的抗旱斗争中，我们好像见过面。
    “成事”果真“在天”么？作为一个辩证唯物主义者，首先应当尊重事实。湖北红安县建苏公社铁炉管理区联合生产队三小队旱情一发生，胡家岗的三十五亩中稻田就快干白了；远水难救近田，有人丧气得很：“眼看快到手的东西收不上，对老天爷真是没办法！”情况是不是这样？这个管理区总支书记姜焱樵的回答是否定的：“谁说收不上？一粒不让丢！”决心一下，马上就发动群众，架起八节水车，带头车水抗旱。水，终于爬上胡家岗了；谷，终于吃饱喝足了。这一来，那些原来丧气的，现在又有几分喜色了：“干部带头干，有旱变无旱。人呀，还是比天狠！”实践出真理：人有主观能动性，因此，归根到底，人终究比天狠些。这个科学的概念，对于“成事在天”的说法，就是一个有力的驳斥；真理嘛，应当是成事“在人”，而不“在天”。
    “成事在人”和“成事在天”，看来仅是一字之差，却明显地标志着两种不同的世界观：人，究竟是自然的奴隶，还是自然的主人？诚然，人类在今天还没有达到叫天下雨天就不敢不下雨、叫天不下雨天就不敢下雨的地步，因而雨涝干旱还会带给我们灾害。但是，人类发展到今天，在和大自然作斗争的过程中，逐步地认识自然，掌握自然的规律，因而已经能够在一定程度上驾驭自然。在自然灾害面前听天由命，是十足的自然的奴隶；在自然灾害面前坚决作斗争，就是自然的主人。在社会主义制度下，特别是我们有了总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝，我们就有了战胜自然灾害的巨大力量，可以变大灾为小灾，变小灾为无灾。记得马雅可夫斯基曾经写下这样有名的诗句：
    “我们一定会得到丰收，
    大地啊，
    你要三倍地增产！”
    这里边，洋溢着多少主人翁的自豪感！大自然啊，你一定要俯首听命！在我们伟大的祖国，特别是在大跃进的光辉的年代，这种感情，得到了升华。中国劳动人民还有过去那一副奴隶相么？没有了，他们做了主人了。“中华人民共和国九百六十万平方公里上面的劳动人民，现在真正开始统治这块地方了。”（毛主席：《介绍一个合作社》）因此，成事全在于人！
