Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 4th: The Pathet Lao Fighting Units Radio broadcast on the evening of the 3rd that the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on the 3rd regarding Prince Souvanna Phouma's expression on the 2nd of wanting to negotiate with the Pathet Lao Fighting Units. The statement said that resolving issues between both sides through consultation is the Lao Patriotic Front's deep desire and consistent position.

But as the coup committee has confirmed many times, there are no favorable conditions for holding negotiations as long as the lackeys of US imperialism, the Phoumi Nosavan Group, remain in the government.

The people of the whole country still clearly remember the previous painful lessons, so they demand that this negotiation must have real guarantees. Therefore, the Lao Patriotic Front puts forward the following suggestions, and believes that these suggestions are very necessary minimal conditions for carrying out negotiations to achieve true and consolidated national harmony and national unity:

(1) Expel the Phoumi Nosavan Group from the government.
(2) Immediately stop the civil war. Immediately order a halt to the terror "sweeps" being carried out by reactionaries everywhere.
(3) Immediately release former Pathet Lao Fighting Units personnel and other patriotic, peace-loving people who are currently being illegally imprisoned throughout the country. And announce the restoration of the people's free and democratic rights as stipulated in the Constitution.
(4) Pursue a genuine policy of peaceful neutrality, immediately establish diplomatic relations with all countries with different social and political systems; quickly request economic assistance from all countries willing to assist Laos without any political and military strings attached.

The Lao Patriotic Front hopes that Prince Souvanna Phouma and the Royal Government should actively create the above conditions so that the consultations can achieve the good results that the coup committee and the people of the whole country hope for.

The statement condemned the US imperialists and the Phoumi Nosavan Group for breaking their promises, tearing up the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreement, dissolving the coalition government, persecuting and arresting the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front and the Pathet Lao Fighting Units, and carrying out brutal "sweeps" against the patriotic people. The statement pointed out that the Phoumi Nosavan Group, supported by US imperialism, has now regained its position in the government and parliament. Negotiations and consultations under these conditions will not only encounter serious obstacles, but even be sabotaged. It may also restore the previous situation, and may mislead the people into believing that the crisis of aggression by US imperialism, which is seriously threatening our motherland, and the treasonous conspiracy of the Phoumi Nosavan Group, no longer exist.

The Lao Patriotic Front finally called on the people to continuously heighten their vigilance against the new and vicious conspiracies of US imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan Group; to continue to strengthen unity and struggle.

    老挝爱国战线党发表声明提出同富马谈判的条件
    要求驱逐诺萨万集团立即停止内战
    号召人民加强团结斗争警惕美帝国主义和诺萨万集团的恶毒阴谋
    新华社河内4日电　寮国战斗部队电台3日晚上广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会3日就梭发那·富马亲王2日表示要同寮国战斗部队谈判的问题发表声明说，通过协商方法来解决双方之间的有关问题是老挝爱国战线党的深切愿望和一贯的立场。
    但正如政变委员会多次确认的，无论什么时候在政府中还有美帝国主义的走狗富米·诺萨万集团的地位，那么就没有举行谈判的顺利条件。
    全国人民仍然清楚地记得以前的沉痛教训，所以要求这次谈判必须具有确实的保障。因此，老挝爱国战线党提出以下建议，并认为这些建议是进行谈判来实现真正的和巩固的民族和睦和国家统一的非常必要的起码条件：
    （一）把富米·诺萨万集团从政府中驱逐出去。
      （二）立即停止内战。立即下令停止反动分子正在各地进行的恐怖“扫荡”。
    （三）立即释放目前正在全国被非法监禁的前寮国战斗部队人员和其他爱国、爱和平的人士。并且宣布恢复宪法中所规定的人民的自由民主权利。
      （四）奉行真正的和平中立政策，立即同一切不同社会和政治制度的国家建立外交关系；迅速向一切愿意援助老挝而不附带任何政治和军事束缚条件的国家，请求经济援助。
    老挝爱国战线党希望，梭发那·富马亲王和王国政府，应该积极地创造上述条件，以便使协商的进行取得像政变委员会和全国人民所希望那样的良好结果。
    声明谴责了美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万集团背信弃义撕毁日内瓦协议和万象协议，解散了联合政府，迫害和逮捕老挝爱国战线党和寮国战斗部队的领导人，并对爱国人民进行残酷“扫荡”的种种罪行。声明指出，目前美帝国主义所扶植的富米·诺萨万集团又恢复了其在政府和议会中的地位。在这种条件下进行谈判协商，不但会遇到严重障碍，甚至遭到破坏。也可能恢复以前的情况，并且会使人民误认为目前正在严重威胁我们祖国的美帝国主义的侵略危机和富米·诺萨万集团的卖国阴谋已经不复存在了。
    老挝爱国战线党最后号召人民对美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万集团的新的恶毒阴谋要不断提高警惕；要继续加强团结斗争。
