    Harder Than Steel

    What is the hardest thing in the world? Some say it's steel. No, revolutionary will is harder than steel.

    Look at the heroes on the steel front, which one is not a steely, iron-boned man! When the Party called for increased steel production, the response was thunderous, and the steel warriors replied, "We must muster all our energy; not an ounce of steel can be spared." Sure enough, we see that steel plants in many places have fulfilled their steel production increase tasks to the letter.

    This is a "hard energy"!

    Where does the hardness lie?

    The hardness lies in the heroes' steel will that fears no difficulty, and the hardness lies in their revolutionary drive to overcome any difficulty.

    Steel is forged, and "hard energy" is also forged. To change the face of "poverty and blankness," it is impossible without revolution and hard work. Overcome difficulties—achieve victory—overcome new difficulties—achieve greater victory. On the road forward, withstand the wind, withstand the waves, be unyielding, and move forward courageously. Thus, that "hard energy" is also tempered into steel in the furnace of revolutionary thought, becoming increasingly hard.

    Like Climbing a Mountain

    The No. 6 furnace of Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant is old. The leadership gave No. 6 furnace the task of forty tons, which is quite arduous. However, steel furnace chief Yang Yuqi said, "We guarantee that No. 6 furnace will complete forty tons!" How heroic Yang Yuqi was when he said this! No difficulty is insurmountable. But when he specifically completes the task, he is meticulous and resourceful, and as a result, a furnace designed for ten tons actually loads thirty-one tons of molten iron.

    Steelmaking is a tough battle. To fight a tough battle, you must not only have a strong ambition, but also effective methods. The so-called effective methods are effective measures, specific methods, steady and sure, invincible, and any difficulty will be solved easily when encountered.

    Like climbing a mountain. You must have the ambition to climb the peak and the heroic spirit of not fearing any difficulties, but also a down-to-earth and cautious attitude, seriously treating the difficulties on the way forward, and not being careless in every step. Aim for the peak, act step by step, implement step by step, climb higher step by step, and you can reach the ideal peak.

    比钢还硬
    世界上什么东西最硬？有人说是钢。不，革命的意志比钢还硬。
    请看：钢铁战线上的英雄们，哪一个不是钢筋铁骨的硬汉子！党号召增产钢铁，振臂一呼，山鸣谷应，钢铁战士们回答说：“劲，要鼓得十足；钢，要一两不少。”果然不错，我们看到许多地方的钢铁厂硬是不折不扣地完成了增产钢铁的任务。
    这是一股子“硬劲”！
    硬在哪里？
    硬就硬在英雄们具有不怕任何困难的钢铁意志，硬就硬在他们有着战胜任何困难的革命干劲。
    钢，是炼出来的，“硬劲”，也是炼出来的。要改变“一穷二白”的面貌，不革命，不硬干是不行的。克服困难——取得胜利——克服新的困难——取得更大的胜利。在前进的道路上，顶得住风吹，经得起浪打，百折不挠，勇往直前。于是，那股子“硬劲”在革命思想的熔炉中也就百炼成钢，越来越坚硬了。
    譬如登山
    天津第二钢厂六号炉已经老了。领导上给六号炉的任务是四十吨，这任务是够艰巨的。可是，炼钢炉长杨玉琦说：“我们保证六号炉完成四十吨！”杨玉琦说这句话的时候，多么豪迈！任何困难都不在话下。可是当他具体完成任务的时候，却又心细如发，足智多谋，结果一个设计十吨的炉子竟然装到三十一吨铁水。
    炼钢，是打硬仗。打硬仗，不仅要有硬志气，而且还要有硬办法。所谓硬办法，就是措施有效，办法具体，稳扎稳打，攻无不克，任何困难碰到它都会迎刃而解。
    譬如登山。要有攀登高峰的雄心壮志和不怕任何困难的英雄气概，也要有踏踏实实的谨慎态度，认真对待前进途中的困难，每走一步都不能粗心大意。志在高峰，行在足下，步步落实，步步登高，才能攀上理想高峰。
