Xinhua News Agency, September 4th: The vast number of soldiers in the Chinese People's Liberation Army have been carrying out phonetic literacy and Mandarin learning, achieving remarkable results in a short period.

The PLA troops have always attached great importance to Mandarin training for new recruits inducted each year. However, the new recruits come from all over the country, and dialects are very complex. Before the adoption of phonetic literacy, it took a lot of time and could not quickly adapt to the needs of training. This year, the General Political Department issued instructions on learning the phonetic alphabet and promoting Mandarin. Since various units adopted the method of combining phonetic literacy, cultural learning, and Mandarin promotion, this process has been greatly shortened. Some new soldiers who joined the army this year learned the phonetic alphabet after only thirty or forty hours. Then, they used the phonetic alphabet to carry out literacy and promote Mandarin. Significant results have been achieved in just a few months, which has promoted the training and work of the troops. For example, Wang Huizhou, a new soldier in a certain unit, was extremely happy when he arrived at the company and saw the shiny guns and cannons, and couldn't wait to learn how to use them. However, when the platoon leader gave a lesson on weapon performance, Wang Huizhou didn't understand Mandarin. He listened for two hours but didn't understand. After learning the phonetic alphabet and Mandarin, it was much easier for him to learn military lessons, and he made rapid progress.

When various units organized soldiers to carry out phonetic literacy and promote Mandarin, they adopted the mass line and launched a vigorous mass movement. A certain PLA unit stationed in Hebei Province initially faced many difficulties, such as a shortage of teachers, textbooks, and experience. The Party Committee proposed: if there are no teachers, find them among the masses; if there are no textbooks, let the masses compile them; if there are no solutions, mobilize the masses to think. Through recommendations from various units and intensive training by business departments, more than twenty teachers were quickly cultivated. A certain unit of the Chengdu area troops adopted the method of "soldiers teaching soldiers," selecting a group of soldiers with a primary school education and good Mandarin from various companies, training them for four days, and cultivating them into small teachers who could spell, write, and teach.

The promotion of Mandarin in the troops has been warmly welcomed by the majority of soldiers. However, some soldiers are not used to changing their native dialects. Based on these situations, the Party committees of various units organized everyone to study the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Political Department, as well as the experience of phonetic literacy in Wanrong County, Shanxi. They widely publicized the benefits of carrying out phonetic literacy and promoting Mandarin, creating an atmosphere in which everyone learns Mandarin and everyone speaks Mandarin. The soldiers' cultural schools in many companies have become the basic front for promoting phonetic literacy and Mandarin.

In organizing the majority of soldiers to carry out phonetic literacy and promote Mandarin, various companies have paid attention to starting from reality, figuring out the corresponding rules between soldiers' dialects and Mandarin, and then prescribing the right remedy. A certain unit of the Guangzhou area troops specifically investigated the soldiers' origins and pronunciation characteristics. After finding out the rules, the language was no longer changed word by word, but in batches, which greatly facilitated teaching. Many units also provided individualized instruction based on the different characteristics of soldiers from different regions, correcting them one by one. And they paid attention to connecting with reality, closely combining phonetic literacy with military and everyday language, and completely changing dialects. Yuan Shilian, the radio platoon leader of a certain unit stationed in Guangxi, created the "flexible tongue" teaching method based on the soldiers' inaccurate pronunciation: he enlarged the human oral cavity diagram, and according to the shape of the tongue rotating when each letter is pronounced, he placed various "tongues" cut out of paper on the oral cavity diagram to demonstrate the position and method of pronouncing each letter, allowing everyone to practice, with very good results.

### 采取群众路线　结合军事用语和日常用语  解放军开展注音识字和学习普通话

    采取群众路线　结合军事用语和日常用语
    解放军开展注音识字和学习普通话
    据新华社4日讯　中国人民解放军广大士兵开展注音识字和学习普通话，在短时间内有了显著成绩。
    解放军部队历来都十分重视对每年应征入伍的新兵进行普通话训练，但新兵来自全国各地，方言土语十分复杂，在没有采用注音识字以前，费时很多，不能很快适应训练的需要。今年总政治部发布了学习拼音字母和推广普通话的指示，各部队采取注音识字、学文化、推广普通话三结合的办法以来，这个过程大大缩短了。今年入伍的一些新战士，有的经过三、四十个小时，就学会了拼音字母，然后利用拼音字母进行扫盲和推广普通话，短短几个月就收到了显著效果，对部队的训练和工作起了促进作用。如某部队新战士王辉洲，一到连队看到油光闪亮的枪炮，高兴极了，恨不得马上学会使用。可是排长上课讲武器性能时，王辉洲不懂普通话，听了两个钟头，没有听懂，学习了拼音字母和普通话后，他学习军事课，比过去方便多了，进步也快了。
    各部队组织士兵开展注音识字和推广普通话时，采取了群众路线、大搞群众运动的方法。驻河北省某部队一开始缺教员、少教材、没经验，困难不少，党委提出：没有教员到群众中找，没有教材由群众来编，没有办法发动群众去想。由各单位推荐，业务部门集训，很快培养出二十多名教员。成都地区部队某部采用“以兵教兵”的方法，从各个连队选出一批有高小程度的、普通话讲得好的战士，进行了四天的训练，培养成会拼、会写、会教的小教员。
    部队推广普通话，受到广大士兵的热烈欢迎。但也有一些战士，一时不习惯改变家乡话。各部队党委根据这些情况，组织大家学习了中共中央和总政治部的指示，以及山西万荣县注音识字的经验。广泛宣传了开展注音识字和推广普通话的好处，造成人人学普通话，人人说普通话的风气。许多连队的士兵文化学校，成了推广注音识字和普通话的基本阵地。
    在组织广大士兵开展注音识字和推广普通话中，各连队都注意从实际出发，摸清士兵方言与普通话的对应规律，然后对症下药。广州地区部队某部专门调查了士兵的籍贯和发音的特点，找出规律后，改变语言就不再采取一字一字地改，而采取成批地改，大大便利了教学。许多单位还针对不同地区战士的不同特点，因人施教，逐个纠正。并且注意联系实际，紧密结合军事用语、日常用语的注音识字，彻底改变方言。驻广西部队某连无线电排长袁士廉根据战士发音不准的情况，创造了“活舌头”教学法：把人的口腔图形放大，按照各个字母发音时舌头转动的形态，将纸剪成的各种各样“舌头”安在口腔图形上，演示出各个字母发音的部位和方法，让大家练习，效果很好。
