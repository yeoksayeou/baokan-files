Based on Large-Scale Mass Movement and Strengthened Political Work
Shanghai Steel Plants' Production Management Undergoes Major Reform
Adopting a "Furnace-Team Competition and Vertical-Horizontal Management" System that Suits the Characteristics of Steelmaking Production
Strengthening Responsibility, Strengthening Collaboration, Strengthening Leadership; Workers' Labor Enthusiasm Soars, Competition is Intense
(Our Shanghai dispatch, September 5) On the basis of vigorously launching mass movements and strengthening political and ideological work, Shanghai's steel plants have recently universally implemented a "furnace-team competition, vertical-horizontal management" system, developing the original three-shift system for production and management in workshops into a new system that organizes production vertically by furnace and strengthens management horizontally across the three shifts. This major change in production management is better suited to the characteristics of steelmaking production, which involves multiple and continuous links. It is conducive to more fully leveraging the initiative of the working masses and better promoting a style of unified coordination from top to bottom and left to right, thus powerfully promoting further development of production.

This year, Shanghai's steel plants have strengthened political and ideological work in the process of vigorously launching mass movements, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers has soared. They have created many experiences in production, technology, and management. This "furnace-team system" is an important experience they have explored. It was first started by the iron-melting furnace of the Second Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 at the end of May, and then gradually promoted to iron-melting furnaces in converter workshops throughout the city. Now, this system has been universally implemented in various furnaces and sections of converter, open-hearth, and other workshops in various factories. Originally, each workshop adopted a three-shift system, with each shift uniformly managing everything from the iron-melting furnace and converter to casting, and conducting competitions between the three shifts. However, this form could not well adapt to the strong continuity of steelmaking production. At the same time, after the converter workshop's iron-melting furnace in various factories were converted to alkaline, hot-air operation and underwent comprehensive technological transformation, the technology became more complicated, and the operational requirements for workers became stricter. If workers do not protect the furnace well in the previous shift or even in the previous hour, production may suffer losses in the next shift or the hour after. The three-shift production system could no longer adapt to this new situation.

In order to make the organizational form better adapt to the requirements of production development, the workers of the iron-melting furnace in the Second Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 first implemented the "furnace-team system," in which a group of workers was specifically responsible for the production of one iron-melting furnace around the clock, and took full responsibility from beginning to end. At the same time, some of the technical management powers originally held by the workshop were also delegated to these workers themselves. After the implementation of this "furnace-team system," the workers of the three shifts on this furnace seat strengthened collaboration, consciously unified operations, and new operating techniques such as high wind and high pressure were rapidly implemented, and production increased significantly. In the first production cycle of the No. 1 iron-melting furnace after the implementation of the furnace-team system, the average hourly melting rate increased from less than ten tons to more than fifteen tons. This "furnace-team system" solved the "vertical" contradiction of shift changes, and the collaboration between shifts became better. However, steelmaking production is also a large-scale collaborative production of various links, requiring close cooperation between various sections and various types of work, from charging, iron-melting furnace, converter to casting. If one link is disconnected, the entire production will be affected. Therefore, "horizontal" collaboration is also very important. When Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1's Second and Third Converter Workshops promoted the "furnace-team system," they developed the experience of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 based on this production feature. While organizing production by furnace, each of the three shifts in the workshop also had its own specific targets, and production plans were implemented shift by shift. In this way, the mass competition activities were carried out in a crisscross manner, production collaboration became closer, and new records continued to emerge. Now, various factories have generally adopted this "furnace-team competition, vertical-horizontal management" method.

The emergence of this crisscross "furnace-team system" is a new change in production organization that has emerged with the vigorous development of the mass movement on Shanghai's steel front. Its rapid promotion has further stimulated the labor enthusiasm and consciousness of the masses, and further promoted the communist style of close collaboration between the three shifts and between the various sections on the left and right. Because a group of workers is specifically responsible for each furnace, the workers of the three shifts within this group are ideologically consistent, have the same goals, and operate in a unified manner. Every move is made from the perspective of the entire furnace's production and the collective's honor. The previous shift proactively creates conditions for the next shift, and keeps the furnace in good condition before going off duty, and often pays attention to maintenance. They also conscientiously explain the situation and problems during shift handover. Once, when the night shift workers of the No. 1 iron-melting furnace in the Second Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 were handing over the shift, they found that the tapping hole was blocked. Worried that the workers taking over were not familiar with the situation, they stayed in front of the furnace after handing over the shift and unblocked the tapping hole together with the workers taking over before going back to rest, so that production was not affected. At the same time, due to the strengthening of "horizontal" collaboration, the various types of work in the shift are united and concentrated to ensure that the shift produces more molten iron and more steel. The workers in the material yard work tirelessly and insist on "making fine food from coarse grains," sifting out small pieces of lime and breaking up large ones. The workers transporting the material proactively watch the material line in front of the furnace to ensure that the furnace is well-fed. Various sections such as furnace lining and hot air do their jobs well and create conditions for the furnace front in many ways. Due to the good collaboration between the various sections and the three shifts, the average hourly melting rate of the No. 1 iron-melting furnace in the Second Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 reached 18.1 tons, and the furnace life reached 276 heats, becoming a red banner among Shanghai's large iron-melting furnaces.

After the implementation of the "furnace-team system" and the delegation of some management work, the power of workers to participate in technical management has been further expanded. Therefore, the production enthusiasm and consciousness of the masses have been further enhanced, and the sense of responsibility has been greatly strengthened. They have come up with many ways to improve the output and quality of the furnace and actively adopt new operating techniques and advanced experience. In order to improve the furnace operation rate and give full play to the potential of the equipment, workers cherish their furnace like their own eyes. The furnace workers not only operate strictly and conscientiously, but also do maintenance work, and also discuss methods with bricklayers and furnace builders to help them make the bricks strong and the furnace lining evenly bricked to extend the life of the iron-melting furnace and converter. The No. 1 converter in the Second Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 also implemented the methods of "package brickmaking," "package lining," and "package steelmaking," and the furnace life was six heats higher than the average level of other converters in the workshop. After the management power of air volume, air pressure, slag, and coke ratio was delegated from the workshop level to the furnace seat, the furnace leaders of each furnace flexibly grasped and adjusted them at any time according to the production situation. For example, once a "hanging material" problem occurred in an iron-melting furnace in the Second Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, the furnace leader immediately asked the blower room workers to lower the air pressure. After a while, they asked them to increase the air pressure. After repeating this "rising" and "falling" several times, the "hanging material" was flushed down. This was more timely than solving the problem in the past. Now, the melting rate and desulfurization rate of the iron-melting furnaces in various factories are steadily increasing. In the converter workshops of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, No. 3, and No. 5, the average hourly output of molten iron from large iron-melting furnaces has generally increased from about 10 tons to more than 14 tons, and many iron-melting furnaces have reached about 18 tons, even when the sulfur content of the iron is around 0.7%.

On the basis of vertical and horizontal management, the factories also organize labor competitions between shifts and furnaces, making the mass movement develop more vigorously and solidly. In such competition activities, the factories set up models, conduct test furnaces, and strive to catch up and strive for the top. Since late August, the First, Second, and Third Converter Workshops of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 have successively created the highest daily output record since this year. After the six iron-melting furnaces in the converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5 started competition, the average melting rate increased by 30% to 40% compared with the past, and the desulfurization effect increased by about 20%.

After the implementation of the "furnace-team system," the workshop leaders also changed the past situation of one person bearing the heavy burden. Many technical problems are solved by the workers themselves, and they have more time to go deep into the front line of production to help solve key problems. The main leaders of the converter workshops of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, No. 3, and No. 5 all have test furnaces. They constantly summarize experience through test furnaces to promote overall work; they go down to grasp key problems and solve key problems. Each workshop also changed the original party branches established by shifts to party branches established by sections such as iron-melting furnace, converter, machine repair, and steel casting, closely combining political and ideological work with professional production leadership.

    在大搞群众运动和加强政治工作的基础上
    上海各钢铁厂生产管理大改革
    适应炼钢生产特点普遍实行“班炉竞赛纵横管理”的包炉制
    加强责任心　加强协作　加强领导　职工劳动热情高涨　竞赛热烈
    本报上海5日电　上海各钢铁厂炼钢车间，在大搞群众运动加强政治思想工作的基础上，最近普遍实行了“班炉竞赛、纵横管理”的“包炉制”，把原来车间生产、管理分上下三班的组织形式，发展为既按炉座纵的组织生产、又按上下三班横的加强管理的新制度。这一生产管理工作上的大变革，更能适应炼钢生产环节多、连续性强的特点，有利于更充分发挥工人群众的积极性，便于更好发扬上下左右协调一致、万众一心的风格，从而有力地促进了生产的进一步发展。
    今年，上海各钢铁厂在大搞群众运动中，加强了政治思想工作，广大职工的革命热情高涨，在生产、技术、管理上创造了很多经验。这种“包炉制”就是他们摸索到的一项重要经验。5月底，它由上钢三厂第二转炉车间化铁炉首先开始，以后逐步在全市各转炉车间化铁炉上推广；现在，各厂的转炉、平炉等车间的各种炉子、各个工段已普遍推行了这一制度。原来，各车间都是采用上下三班的组织形式，每班从化铁炉、转炉到浇铸都统一管理，上下三班之间开展竞赛。但这种形式不能很好适应炼钢生产连续性很强的特点。同时，各厂转炉车间化铁炉改为碱性、热风操作，进行全面技术改造以后，技术更复杂了，对工人的操作要求更严格了。工人在上一班、甚至在前一小时，不保护好炉子，就有可能在下一班、后一小时使生产受到损失。按上下三班组织生产的形式，更加不能适应这种新的形势。
    为了使组织形式更好适应生产发展的要求，上钢三厂第二转炉车间化铁炉工人首先实行“包炉制”，一座化铁炉日夜三班的生产划给一批职工专门负责，从头到尾全部包下来；同时，原来归车间掌握的有些技术管理权力，也下放给这批职工自己掌握。实行了这种“包炉制”以后，这个炉座的三班工人之间加强了协作，自觉地统一操作，大风、高压等新的操作技术迅速得到贯彻，生产显著提高。一号化铁炉实行包炉制的第一个生产周期，平均小时熔化率就从原来的十吨以内上升到十五吨以上。这种“包炉制”解决了交接班“纵”的矛盾，上下班之间协作更好了。但炼钢生产又是各个环节的大协作生产，要求从上料、化铁炉、转炉到浇铸的各个工段、各个工种相互密切配合，一环脱节，整个生产就要受到影响，因此，“横”的协作也十分重要。上钢一厂第二、第三转炉车间，在推行“包炉制”时，又根据这一生产特点，发展了上钢三厂的经验。他们在按炉座包生产的基础上，车间上下三班每班又都有自己的具体指标，生产计划班班落实。这样，群众的竞赛活动便纵横交错地展开了，生产协作也更密切了，新纪录不断涌现。现在，各厂一般都采用了这种“班炉竞赛、纵横管理”的办法。
    这种纵横交错的“包炉制”的出现，是随着上海钢铁战线群众运动蓬勃开展的新形势，在生产组织上产生的一个新变化；它的迅速推广，又进一步激发了群众的劳动热情和自觉，更加发扬了上下三班和左右各工段之间密切协作的共产主义风格。由于每个炉座的一批职工专门负责，因此，这批职工内部的三班工人思想一致、目标一致、操作一致，一举一动都从整个炉子的生产、集体的荣誉出发。上一班主动为下一班创造条件，下班前都把炉子搞得很正常，并且经常注意维护。在交班时还做到认真交情况、交问题。上钢一厂第二转炉车间一号化铁炉，有一次夜班工人在交班时，发现出铁眼堵塞，他们耽心接班的工人情况不熟悉，交班以后，仍守候在炉前，和接班工人一起打通了铁眼，然后才回去休息，使生产没有受到影响。同时，由于加强了“横”的协作，班内各个工种之间团结一致，集中力量保证本班多出铁水、多炼钢。料场工人不辞辛苦，坚持“粗粮细作”，把石灰块子小的筛去，大的敲碎；运料工人主动到炉前看料线，保证炉子吃饱吃好；砌炉、热风等各个工段都把自己工作做好，多方面为炉前创造条件。上钢三厂第二转炉车间一号化铁炉由于各个工段、上下三班协作好，平均小时熔化率达到了十八点一吨，炉龄达到二百七十六炉，成为上海大型化铁炉中的一面红旗。
    推行“包炉制”，把有些管理工作下放以后，进一步扩大了工人参加技术管理的权力，因此，群众的生产积极性、自觉性更为高涨，责任感大大加强。他们想出许多办法来提高炉子的产量质量，积极采用新的操作技术和先进经验。为了提高炉子作业率，充分发挥设备潜力，工人爱护自己的炉子像爱护自己的眼睛一样。炉前工人不仅操作时严格、认真，人人做维护工作，而且还和打砖、砌炉的泥工一道商量办法，帮助他们把砖打得结实，炉衬砌得砖缝均匀，以延长化铁炉、转炉的寿命。上钢三厂第二转炉车间一号转炉，还实行了“包打”、“包砌”、“包炼”的办法，炉龄比车间内其它转炉的平均水平高出了六炉。风量、风压、渣料、焦比等的管理权力由车间一级掌握下放给炉座以后，各炉炉长都随时根据生产情况灵活掌握调整。如上钢三厂第二转炉车间一只化铁炉有次发生了“挂料”毛病，炉长马上要鼓风房工人把风压降低；停了一会，又要他们把风压升高，这样反复“上升”、“下降”了几次，就把“挂料”冲了下来。这比过去解决问题更加及时了。现在，各厂化铁炉的熔化率、去硫率都稳步上升。上钢一厂、三厂、五厂转炉车间的大型化铁炉，在铁的硫磺配到0.7％左右的情况下，平均每小时出的铁水普遍由十吨左右提高到十四吨以上，有不少化铁炉已达到十八吨左右。
    在纵横管理的基础上，各厂又组织班与班、炉与炉之间的劳动竞赛，使群众运动开展得更轰轰烈烈扎扎实实。在这样的竞赛活动中，各厂大树标兵，大搞试验炉，你追我赶，力争上游。8月下旬以来，上钢一厂第一、第二、第三转炉车间都连续创造了今年以来日产量最高纪录。上钢五厂转炉车间的六座化铁炉之间开展竞赛以后，平均熔化率比过去提高了30％到40％，去硫效果提高了20％左右。
    实行“包炉制”以后，车间领导干部也改变了过去千斤担子一人挑的情况，不少技术问题由工人自己动手解决，他们就有更多的时间深入生产第一线，帮助解决关键问题。上钢一厂、三厂、五厂各转炉车间的主要领导干部，人人有试验炉，通过试验炉不断总结经验，推动全面工作；下去抓住关键问题，解决关键问题。各车间还把原来按班成立党支部改为按化铁炉、转炉、机修、浇钢等工段成立党支部，把政治思想工作和专业生产领导紧紧结合起来。（附图片）
