    Heroic Soldiers in Flood Fighting and Rescue
    Underwater Battle
    On the evening of August 4th, the bridgehead of a large iron bridge in the Liaoyang area was in critical condition. The raging floodwaters rose to within half a meter of the bridge deck, and the stones and soil of the bridgehead embankment were collapsing. If the bridgehead were washed away by the flood, the entire city of Liaoyang would be submerged, and transportation on the Shenyang-Dalian line would be interrupted.
    Two hundred and sixty-eight officers and soldiers from a cadre training battalion of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army organized a flood fighting and rescue team and rushed to the bridgehead overnight in the wind and rain. Standing in waist-deep water, they drove stakes and piled sandbags, building a new levee overnight.
    Suddenly, a new situation arose: the water level rose fifteen centimeters, and there was a place on the outside of the dam where water was gushing upwards, and it couldn't be blocked no matter what. Some people said that there might be a problem with the foundation of the bridgehead embankment. Song Huanxiang, the political commissar of the assault team, immediately convened a Party committee meeting on the bridgehead and made the decision to dive and explore.
    With the flood raging, the assault team had no diving suits or lifebuoys, and diving exploration was a difficult task. However, two hundred and twenty-four Communist Party members in the assault team surrounded Political Commissar Song and scrambled to ask for permission to dive: "I have twenty years of experience in the water, and I can walk back and forth across this river!" "I can stay underwater for an hour while catching fish!" "I am a marathon runner and cross the river at home without a boat!" "I am from Harbin and have swum across the Songhua River!" "I have crossed the Yangtze River!" "..."
    Seventeen comrades with good swimming skills were approved for diving exploration. Xie Kui, the deputy instructor, and Xu Jiulan, a new soldier, were the first to go into the water. After tying their safety ropes, they jumped into the huge waves. Hundreds of pairs of eyes from the officers and soldiers and civilians on the bridgehead and riverbank were watching the surface of the water. Political Commissar Song looked at his watch from time to time. Three minutes, ten minutes... fifteen minutes passed. Xie Kui had dived into the water and hadn't come out yet. The water was too fast, and Xu Jiulan couldn't dive down and was still floating on the surface, which was so worrying! Suddenly, after a huge wave, Xu Jiulan plunged into the water, and Xie Kui also emerged from the water. Xie Kui, treading water, reported to the shore: "Most of the embankment slope has been washed away, and you can touch the stones and grass on the embankment foundation, but some parts are not clear." When Political Commissar Song asked him to go ashore and change people to go down, Xie Kui said, "Let me do it again!" and plunged into the water again. At this time, Xu Jiulan also appeared on another water surface and supplemented some information about the embankment foundation being washed away. After the second and third groups of soldiers diving down and coming up, the information they reported was exactly the same as Xie Kui and Xu Jiulan reported.
    The danger was scouted clearly. The soldiers and civilians stood at the forefront, and together with more than nine hundred men and women, used tens of thousands of sacks filled with stones and soil to block the pits and reinforce the embankment foundation. The rapid whirlpool under the bridgehead was finally subdued.
    The train, loaded with passengers and materials, whistled and sped safely across the large iron bridge and sped away into the distance.
    A Small Boat in the Waves
    Ma Wei, the instructor of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, led several soldiers in the "Iron No. 1" boat, braving the wind and rain, fighting the flood for more than ten hours, and rescued more than sixty people trapped by the water. Now, before they had time to drink a sip of tea, they broke through the rolling flood and headed for Yuyuchi Village in the Shaling People's Commune.
    The boat stopped beside a large courtyard in the village with a high terrain. Ma Wei jumped off the boat and helped the disaster-stricken people onto the boat. In a short while, the boat was crowded with forty-seven adults and children. The boat had exceeded the specified load. What to do? Should some of the villagers who boarded the boat go down first, and then come back to pick them up? Ma Wei thought in his heart: "No! We must do everything possible to rescue them all from this dangerous area!" He shouted loudly: "Folks, we are about to set sail. Please sit tight and don't move around. No matter what happens, we must get you to a safe place." He took the lead and pushed the boat into the water with several soldiers, while organizing four members of the Communist Youth League, including Chen Youde, to pull the towline along the telephone poles on the river bank. It was dark and rainy, and they were going against the current, so the comrades pulling the towline had to grope their way forward.
    When the boat was thirty meters away from the landing point, they suddenly heard the flood roaring along the breach, and the boat shook violently. Some of the commune members on the boat were panicked. This was the deepest part of the water. If the boat could not pass through smoothly and quickly, it could be swept away by the flood. Instructor Ma stood on the bow of the boat and said, "Folks, as long as everyone sits tight, the boat can move forward smoothly. Don't worry, folks, as long as we, the People's Liberation Army, are here, we will definitely rescue you."
    The boat stabilized, and Instructor Ma directed the soldiers to fight the flood calmly. The "Iron No. 1" boat finally broke through the flood and reached the landing point victoriously.
    In the Rapids
    The rain was getting heavier and heavier, and some places had turned into a vast ocean. Du Xican, the deputy squad leader of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, and gunner Chen Xinshan, rescued the last batch of things from the commune's production team and were preparing to move to high ground.
    At this moment, several black spots appeared in the churning flood.
    "Quick, go into the water to save people!" Du Xican shouted to Chen Xinshan, grabbed a bamboo pole, and jumped into the water. Squad Leader Ren Hongxuan also arrived, and the three of them rushed towards the workers who had fallen into the water. When they were about to approach the drowning people, they were swept back by the emptying waves. The flood was getting bigger and bigger, and the waves were turning more and more violently. However, the soldiers had only one thought: "Paddle over there, saving people is the most important thing." But, paddle up, get swept back, paddle up, get swept back... The white waves, one after another, sometimes pushed them into the air, and sometimes threw them into the deep valley. At this time, Platoon Leader Miao Chuanting also arrived. Despite the fact that he was running a high fever, he immediately jumped into the water to rescue the masses and soldiers.
    Three workers were rescued ashore. However, Miao Chuanting and three soldiers were swept away by the rapids...
    They met on a swaying apricot tree. Communist Party member Miao Chuanting convened a group meeting. He was the first to speak: "The situation is serious. We are surrounded by floods. Only by being brave, calm, and united can we overcome the flood..." "As long as there is a breath, we must fight the flood to the end and rescue the people!" Communist Party member Ren Hongxuan said. Then, Communist Youth League members Du Xican and Chen Xinshan said: "Wherever the platoon leader points, we will go there. We will never spare our lives, and it is glorious to sacrifice for the interests of the people!" A gust of wind set off fierce waves, and the apricot tree was knocked down. Some of the four people hugged the big tree, and some held the lifebuoy they had just picked up, drifting away with the overlapping waves.
    A day and a night passed. After eating some elm leaves they had picked in the water to satisfy their hunger, the three soldiers were washed by the rapids onto a beach. Platoon Leader Miao Chuanting drifted for more than eighty miles and was also rescued near the Taizi River Iron Bridge. Their heroic deeds of rescuing the people in the face of danger have been spread everywhere among the people in the驻地.

    抗洪抢险中的英雄战士
    水下的战斗
    8月4日晚上，辽阳地区一座大铁桥的桥头堡告急，凶猛的洪水涨到离桥面只有半米，桥头堡堤岸的石块、泥土哗哗下泻。如果桥头堡被洪水冲垮，辽阳全城就会被淹，沈（阳）大（连）线交通运输就会中断。
    人民解放军某部干部训练大队二百六十八名官兵，组织了一支抗洪抢险大队，冒着风雨连夜赶到了桥头堡。他们站在没腰深的水中一面扎桩，一面垒砂袋，一夜间就筑起了一道新的堤坝。
    突然，出现了一个新的情况：水位上涨十五厘米，坝外地区有一处向上冒水，怎么也堵不住。有人说，这可能是桥头堡堤基有问题。突击队政治委员宋焕祥立即在桥头堡上召开了党委会，做出了潜水探险的决定。
    洪水滔滔，突击队没有潜水衣和救生圈，潜水探险是件困难的事。但是，突击队里二百二十四名共产党员围着宋政委争先恐后地要求批准潜水：“我有二十年水龄，在这条河上可以走个来回！”“我在水底下摸鱼可以呆一个小时！”“我是马拉松运动员，在家过河不坐船！”“我是哈尔滨人，游过松花江！”“我横渡过长江！”“……”
    十七个水性好的同志被批准潜水探险了。第一批下水的副指导员谢奎和新战士徐久兰，拴好保险绳后就跳进巨浪里。桥头堡上、河堤上，官兵和民工们数百双眼睛都在注视着水面，宋政委不时的望着手表，三分钟、十分钟……十五分钟过去了。谢奎潜入水底还没有出来，水太急，徐久兰扎不下去还浮在水面上，叫人多么焦急啊！忽然，一个巨浪过后，徐久兰扎进水中，谢奎也钻出了水面。谢奎踩着水向岸上报告：“堤坡大部被冲垮，能摸着堤基上的石头和青草，还有一部分没摸清楚”。当宋政委叫他上岸换人下去时，谢奎说了一句“让我再来一次！”就又扎入水底。这时，徐久兰也在另一处水面出现，补充了一些堤基被冲情况。第二批、第三批潜水的官兵下去上来后，报告的情况完全和谢奎、徐久兰报告一样。
    险情侦察清楚了，子弟兵们站在最前列，和九百多名男女民工一起，用成千上万条装着石头和土的麻袋，堵住了坑洞，加固了堤基，桥头堡下的急流漩涡终于被制伏了。
    满载着旅客和物资的火车，鸣着汽笛，安全地穿过大铁桥，向远方飞驰而去。
    波涛中的小船
    人民解放军某部指导员马威，率领几个战士驾着
  “铁一号”船，冒着风雨，在洪水中搏斗了十多个钟头，救出了六十多名被水围困的群众，现在，他们还没来得及进一口茶饭，又冲破滚滚洪峰向沙岭人民公社养鱼池村驶去。
    船在村中地势较高的一个大院旁停下。马威跳下船，扶着受灾群众上船。不一会，船上就挤满了四十七个大人和小孩。船已经超过规定的载重量了。怎么办？叫上船的老乡先下去一些，回来再接他们？马威心里想：“不能！要想尽办法把他们都救出这危险地带！”他高声喊道：“乡亲们，现在就要开船了，请大家坐好，不要乱动，不论遇到什么情况，我们一定要把大家送到安全地方。”他一面带头和几个战士下水推船，一面组织共青团员陈友德等四人，沿着河岸电线杆拉纤。天黑雨大，又是逆水行舟，拉纤的同志只好摸索着前进。
    船行到离登岸点还有三十米时，忽听洪水顺着决口呼呼吼叫，船也随着激烈地摇摆起来。船上的社员们有些惊慌了。这里是水最深的地方，如果船不能平稳，迅速通过，就有被洪流卷走的可能。马指导员站在船头上，说：“乡亲们，只要大家坐稳，船就能平稳前进。乡亲们放心，只要有我们解放军在这里，就一定把你们救出来。”
    船稳定下来了，马指导员指挥着战士沉着地与洪水搏斗。“铁一号”船终于冲破洪流，胜利到达登岸点。
    在激流中
    雨越下越大了，有的地方变成了一片汪洋。解放军某部副班长杜希灿和炮手陈新山，从洪水中救出公社生产队的最后一批东西出来，准备向高地转移。
    这时，翻腾的洪水中出现了几个黑点。
    “快，下水救人！”杜希灿向陈新山喊了一声，手执竹竿，跳下水里。班长任洪轩也到了，三个人就一起扑向落水的工人。当他们将要接近落水者时，却被排空的波浪卷了回来。洪水越来越大，浪头越翻越猛。然而，战士们只有一个念头：“划过去，救人要紧。”但是，划上去，卷回来，划上去，又卷回来……。白花花的浪头，一个紧跟着一个，一会儿把他们推上半空，一会儿又抛下深谷。这时候，排长苗传廷也赶来了，他不顾自己正发着高烧，也立即跳进水中抢救群众和战士。
    三个工人被救上岸了。可是，苗传廷和三个战士却被急流冲走……。
    在一棵摇晃着的杏树上，他们四个人相遇了。共产党员苗传廷召开了一次小组会。他首先发言：“情况是严重的，我们四面都是洪水，只有勇敢、沉着、团结一致，才能战胜洪水……。”“只要有一口气，就要和洪水斗争到底，就要抢救人民群众！”共产党员任洪轩说。接着，共青团员杜希灿、陈新山表示：“排长指到哪里，我们就到哪里，决不吝惜生命，为人民利益牺牲是光荣的！”一阵狂风，掀起猛烈的波浪，杏树被冲倒了，四个人有的抱着大树，有的扶着刚拾来的救生圈，随着重重叠叠的浪涛漂去。
    一天一夜过去了，三个战士在水中摘了些榆树叶充饥以后，被激流冲到了一个沙滩上，排长苗传廷漂流了八十多里，也在太子河铁桥附近遇救。他们见义勇为抢救人民群众的英雄事迹，在驻地人民中到处传诵着。　（新华社沈阳31日电）
