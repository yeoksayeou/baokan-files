Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang Electric Dispatch: Guizhou Province's basic construction system, in the production increase and economy movement centered on grain and steel, adopted the method of "five concentrations" of leadership, labor, materials, equipment, and transportation capacity to accelerate the construction progress of key projects. The total investment in key projects completed in August increased by 16% compared to July. Due to the accelerated construction progress, thirty-five key sub-projects were completed and put into production throughout the month, and thirty-one completed civil engineering work and entered the equipment installation phase.

The "five concentrations" construction method is a relatively systematic experience explored by basic construction units in the Guiyang area in order to concentrate forces and ensure key projects. The specific content and practices are: (1) Under the guidance of the idea of ​​treating the whole country as a coordinated chess game, ensure that leadership is concentrated on key projects based on the importance and urgency of basic construction projects. (2) All basic construction labor should adopt quotas and staffing methods, be uniformly arranged and rationally allocated, and at the same time minimize non-production personnel to ensure that superior forces are used for key projects. (3) Strengthen the management and dispatch of steel, wood, cement and other materials required for basic construction, and clean up building materials or equipment in warehouses, stations, docks, and construction sites, first to meet the needs of key projects. (4) Each basic construction unit must carry out civil engineering construction only when the main equipment is in place, and at the same time designate special personnel to be responsible for material transportation and equipment supporting work to ensure that construction materials and equipment are transported to the construction site in a timely manner. (5) Transportation departments and construction units at all levels should properly arrange the transportation capacity for transporting basic construction materials and equipment, implement them to the designated locations, and meet the needs of construction. Construction units, without increasing or slightly increasing personnel and equipment, set up factories near the construction site to produce building materials in accordance with local conditions, so as to save transportation capacity.

Since the implementation of the "five concentrations" construction method by basic construction units in the Guiyang area, the role of manpower and materials has been fully utilized, and the construction progress of key projects has been accelerated. In the short forty days from the beginning of July to the beginning of August, the steel basic construction projects completed ahead of schedule alone were equivalent to 112.2% of the actual projects completed in the first half of the year, and the quality was good.

The Guizhou Provincial Basic Construction Committee attached great importance to the "five concentrations" construction experience in the Guiyang area, and from the beginning of August, promoted this experience to basic construction units throughout the province. The Kaili County Construction Company of the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture used all the construction forces for building service buildings and offices for the construction of the agricultural machinery factory, so that two of the three workshops of this factory were built in August. Many iron and steel "small foreign groups" bases in Qiannan, Bijie, Tongren and other prefectures and special zones have implemented the "five concentrations" construction method, and the number of small blast furnaces put into production in August increased by 3.4 times compared with July, adding fresh troops to the iron and steel industry.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Electric Dispatch: Shenyang City has concentrated manpower and material resources to build key projects, which has greatly accelerated the progress of key projects. The key projects completed in July by various construction companies under the Municipal Construction Engineering Administration were equal to three times the total number of key projects completed in the first half of the year.

Since the beginning of July, under the leadership of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, basic construction units in Shenyang have concentrated manpower, material resources, and transportation capacity on construction projects to promote steel and agricultural production. Construction, construction, transportation, and other units in the city have extensively carried out large-scale collaborations to jointly accelerate the construction progress of key projects. Many units have taken out their temporarily unused materials to support key units. Construction units undertaking key projects have also changed their past practice of waiting for construction units to supply materials before starting construction, and have taken the initiative to allocate materials for key projects. The Municipal First Construction Engineering Company, after consultation with relevant units, allocated 133 tons of cement, more than 10 tons of steel bars and steel pipes for a key project, thereby accelerating the construction progress of the project. The Municipal Third Construction Engineering Company took the initiative to open its warehouse and took out materials that were not urgently needed for the construction of key projects, so that the key projects were completed quickly.

Under the leadership of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, basic construction units in Shenyang also formed twenty-two party committees with the participation of both parties to jointly lead construction and arrange plans. This has played a good role in speeding up the progress of the project. In the construction of the Sixth Construction Site of the Municipal Second Construction Engineering Company, due to the unified mobilization of the construction forces on the construction site by the construction unit and the construction unit, the construction forces originally scattered in six places were concentrated for use. At the same time, rapid construction was carried out on a large scale. As a result, the construction tasks that originally required more than seventy days to complete were completed in forty days, and the project quality also met national requirements.

### 集中基本建设人力物力　满足重点单位施工需要  贵州沈阳重点工程进度加快

    集中基本建设人力物力　满足重点单位施工需要
    贵州沈阳重点工程进度加快
    据新华社贵阳电　贵州省基本建设系统在以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中，采用领导力量、劳动力、材料、设备和运力“五集中”的方法，加速了重点工程项目的建设进度。8月份完成重点工程投资总额比7月份增长16％。由于建设进度加快，全月有三十五个重点分项工程完工投入生产，三十一个完成土建工程进入设备安装阶段。
    “五集中”的施工方法，是贵阳地区基本建设单位为了集中力量、保证重点而摸索出来的一套比较系统的经验。具体内容和作法是：（1）在全国一盘棋的思想指导下，根据基本建设项目的轻重缓急，保证把领导精力集中用于重点工程。（2）所有的基本建设劳动力，采取定额、定员的办法，统一安排和合理调配，同时尽量减少非生产人员，保证把优势力量用于重点工程。（3）加强对基本建设所需钢材、木料和水泥等材料的管理和调度，清理仓库、车站、码头、工地的建筑材料或设备，首先满足重点工程的需要。（4）各基建单位必须在主要设备落实的情况下才进行土木建筑，同时指定专人负责物资运输和设备配套工作，保证施工的材料、设备及时运到工地。（5）各级运输部门和施工单位，妥善安排运输基建材料、设备的运力，落实到点，满足施工的需要。施工单位在不增加或少增加人员、设备的情况下，因地制宜地在工地附近设厂生产建筑材料，以节约运力。
    贵阳地区基建单位实行“五集中”施工方法以来，充分发挥了人力、物力的作用，加快了重点工程的建设进度。从7月初到8月上旬的短短四十天中，仅提前竣工的钢铁基建项目，就等于上半年实际完成项目的112，2％，而且质量良好。
    贵州省基本建设委员会对贵阳地区的“五集中”施工经验极为重视，从8月初起，把这一经验向全省各地的基本建设单位推广。黔东南苗族侗族自治州凯里县建筑公司，把修建服务大楼和办公室的施工力量全部用于农业机械厂的建设，使这个厂的三个车间在8月份就建成了两个。黔南、毕节、铜仁等州、专区的许多钢铁“小洋群”基地，由于实行“五集中”施工方法，8月份投入生产的小高炉比7月份增长三点四倍，给炼铁工业增加了生力军。
    据新华社沈阳电　沈阳市集中人力、物力建设重点工程，使重点工程进展大大加快。市建筑工程管理局所属各建筑工程公司7月份竣工的重点工程，就等于上半年竣工的重点工程总数的三倍。
    从7月初以来，沈阳市各基本建设单位在中共沈阳市委的领导下，把人力、物力、运力集中用于促进钢铁和农业生产的建设项目。全市的建设、施工、运输等单位，广泛地开展了大协作，共同加快重点工程的施工进度。不少单位把自己暂时不用的材料拿出来支援重点单位。担任重点项目的施工单位，也改变了过去只等建设单位供应材料再施工的作法，主动地为重点工程调剂材料。市第一建筑工程公司经过同有关单位协商，就为一项重点项目调剂一百三十三吨水泥，十多吨钢筋和钢管，从而加速了这项工程的施工进度。市第三建筑工程公司主动打开自己的仓库，拿出不急用的材料用于重点工程的建设，使重点工程迅速竣工。
    沈阳市各基本建设单位在中共沈阳市委领导下，还组成了二十二个由甲乙双方参加的党委会，共同领导施工和安排计划。这对加快工程进度起了良好的作用。市第二建筑工程公司第六工地在施工中，由于建设单位和施工单位统一调动了工地施工力量，将原来分散在六个地方的施工力量集中起来使用，同时大搞快速施工，结果四十天内就完成了过去需要七十多天才能完成的施工任务，工程质量也符合国家要求。
