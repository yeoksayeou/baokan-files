Accumulate Base Fertilizer for Autumn-Sown Crops
    People's communes in Nantong Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, are vigorously building water fertilizer reservoirs, grass mud ponds, and manure pits in the fields, collecting weeds, aquatic plants, and using crop stalks to compost fertilizer on the spot, in order to prepare base fertilizer for autumn-sown crops such as wheat, rapeseed, and broad beans. Currently, the entire prefecture has established more than 1.46 million water fertilizer reservoirs and grass mud ponds (an average of one for every six mu of land), and more than 146,000 field manure pits. Many reservoirs, ponds, and pits are already filled with fertilizer.

Launch an Autumn Fertilizer Accumulation Campaign
    Various regions in Hunan Province are seizing the current favorable opportunity of lush foliage, abundant weeds, high temperatures, and ample fertilizer sources to launch a mass autumn fertilizer accumulation campaign. More than 680,000 laborers in the three prefectures of Xiangtan, Chenxian, and Hengyang have been put into fertilizer accumulation. Xiangtan Prefecture has already accumulated an average of more than 20 dan of fertilizer per mu for late rice and miscellaneous grain crops throughout the prefecture. At present, 77 percent of the late rice fields in the province have been top-dressed once, and the seedlings are growing well.

    In the fertilizer accumulation campaign, all regions have vigorously carried out tool reforms, continuously improving work efficiency. Shuangfeng County has promoted tools such as cableways, slides, carts, and wooden boats for transporting fertilizer according to local conditions, and promoted earth cranes, mud boats for applying fertilizer, and ash boats for top-dressing in fertilizer production, generally improving work efficiency by one to two times.

Large Quantities of City Manure Transported to Rural Areas
    Various cities and towns in Fujian Province are actively accumulating and transporting fertilizer to the countryside to support the autumn field over-production campaign launched by the rural people's communes. Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Nanping cities, combined with a major cleanup to accumulate fertilizer, have transported more than 980,000 dan of various fertilizers to the countryside in seven days. Residents of Lixin Town in Jianning County, after two days of concentrated effort, transported more than 21,000 dan of human excrement, sewer mud, garbage, and other fertilizers to the countryside, and helped apply fertilizer to the fields.

    Shenyang City is rapidly transporting large quantities of city manure to rural fields to support increased production of grain and vegetables in the suburbs. From August 31 to September 2, the city has transported more than 10,000 tons of manure. The autumn vegetables in the suburbs have now all been planted with protective coverings, and the fertilizer sent is just in time for top-dressing needs.

    In the campaign to send city manure to the countryside, all sectors of Shenyang City enthusiastically responded to the Party's call and actively participated in this movement.

Organize the Production of Local Chemical Fertilizer
    Gansu Province is vigorously organizing the production of local chemical fertilizer and local pesticides to support agriculture.

    The Gansu Provincial Petroleum and Chemical Industry Bureau organized the production of local chemical fertilizer and local pesticides as early as the beginning of the year; in May, it organized a 300-person work group and inspection team to provide specific guidance for this production in prefectures and counties. The small chemical fertilizer plants built in Shandan, Longxi, Tianshui, and other places began construction in early April, and due to the vigorous rapid construction, they were put into production in just over a month.

    In order to supply the raw materials needed for the production of chemical fertilizer and pesticides, chemical fertilizer plants and pesticide plants throughout the province have adopted various methods.

### 抓肥如抓粮肥多粮食多

    抓肥如抓粮肥多粮食多
    为秋播作物备底肥
    江苏南通专区各县人民公社，在田头大搞水肥库、草泥塘、大粪池，就地采集杂草、水草和使用农作物秸秆等沤制肥料，为麦子、油菜、蚕豆等秋播作物准备底肥。现在，全区已建立水肥库和草泥塘一百四十六万多个（平均每六亩田一个），田头大粪池十四万六千多个。许多库、塘、池里已经积满了肥料。
    开展秋季积肥运动
    湖南省各地抓住当前树叶野草茂盛，气温高，肥源广的好时机，开展了群众性秋季积肥运动。湘潭、郴县、衡阳等三个专区投入积肥的劳动力达六十八万多人。湘潭专区已为全区晚稻和杂粮作物平均每亩积足了二十多担肥料。目前，全省晚稻田已有百分之七十七追肥一次，禾苗生长良好。
    各地在积肥运动中都大搞工具改革，不断提高工效。双峰县在运肥方面因地制宜推广了索道、滑道、车子、木船等工具，制肥方面推广了土起重机、下肥用泥船、追肥用灰船，工效普遍提高一两倍。
    大批城粪运到农村
    福建省各地城镇纷纷积运肥料下乡，支援农村人民公社开展的秋田超包产运动。福州、泉州、南平三市结合大扫除积肥，七天中已赶运各种肥料九十八万多担下乡。建宁县里心镇居民经过两天突击，运送了两万一千多担人粪尿、阴沟泥、垃圾等肥料下乡，并帮助施肥下田。
    沈阳市迅速把大批城粪运往农村田间，支援郊区增产粮食和蔬菜。从八月三十一日到九月二日，全市已运出粪肥一万多吨。市郊秋菜目前已全部出齐罩垅，送去的肥料正赶上追肥需要。
    在赶送城粪下乡中，沈阳市各行各业热烈响应党的号召，踊跃参加这一运动。
    组织土化肥生产
    甘肃省大力组织土化肥和土农药的生产，支援农业。
    甘肃省石油化工局早在年初就组织了土化肥、土农药的生产；五月份又组织三百人的工作组和检查团，到专区和县具体指导这项生产。山丹、陇西、天水等地兴修的小化肥厂，四月初开始建设，由于大搞快速施工，一个来月就投入了生产。
    为了供应化肥、农药生产所需的原料，全省各地化肥厂、农药厂采取了多种办法。
