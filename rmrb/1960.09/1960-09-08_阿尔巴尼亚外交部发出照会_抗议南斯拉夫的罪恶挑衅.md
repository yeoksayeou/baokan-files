Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 6th. According to the Albanian News Agency on the 6th, the Albanian Foreign Ministry, in a note to the Yugoslav government, lodged the strongest protest against the provocative activities of Yugoslav armed saboteurs who invaded Albanian territory on August 30th of this year.

The note has been delivered to the Yugoslav Legation in Albania.

The note stated that the criminal act of August 30th was not the first, nor was it an isolated incident. Yugoslav authorities have made hostile activities against the People's Republic of Albania a system. They have repeatedly violated Albania's borders, fired on Albanian border guards from Yugoslav territory, and carried out countless attacks and sabotage activities to hinder the peaceful labor of the Albanian people.

The note pointed out that Yugoslav authorities murdered Hassan Spata, an Albanian citizen who, according to the amnesty decree issued by the Presidium of the Albanian People's Assembly and with official documents, was returning to the country, in Belgrade in August 1958. The note continued, now, they have committed even more serious crimes, this time not in Belgrade, but within the borders of Albania, thereby infringing upon Albania's territorial integrity.

It is well known that the Yugoslav government harbors Albanian criminals who collaborated with the fascists and Nazi occupiers, harbors spies from foreign intelligence agencies, people who conspire against the Albanian people and the People's Government, as well as thieves and other common criminals. These criminals are organized and trained in Yugoslavia for the purpose of carrying out hostile activities against the People's Republic of Albania. Many published documents and the trials of subversives, spies, and saboteurs sent from Yugoslavia to Albania by the People's Republic of Albania have exposed all these hostile activities of the Yugoslav authorities to world opinion.

The note pointed out that the Albanian government has, on various occasions, called the attention of the Yugoslav government to the above situation and requested it to take the necessary measures to stop these hostile actions by the Yugoslav authorities, which are incompatible with normal relations between neighboring countries and blatantly violate the norms of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. However, the heinous provocation of August 30th shows that the Yugoslav authorities have not abandoned their hostile actions against the People's Republic of Albania and the Albanian people.

In the protest note, the Albanian government pointed out the grave responsibility of the Yugoslav government for this new heinous provocation and once again demanded that it take measures to stop such dangerous activities. The Albanian government reserves the right to demand compensation from the Yugoslav government for the losses suffered by the victims of the aforementioned provocation.

    阿尔巴尼亚外交部发出照会
    抗议南斯拉夫的罪恶挑衅
    新华社地拉那6日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社6日报道：阿尔巴尼亚外交部在一份给南斯拉夫政府的照会中，就南斯拉夫武装破坏分子在今年8月30日侵入阿尔巴尼亚领土进行挑衅活动，提出最严厉的抗议。
    这份照会已经交给南斯拉夫驻阿尔巴尼亚公使馆。
    照会说，8月30日的犯罪行动并不是第一次，也不是一次偶然的事件。南斯拉夫的机关已经把对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国进行敌对活动当作一种制度。他们一再侵犯阿尔巴尼亚的国境，从南斯拉夫领土上向阿尔巴尼亚边防军人开枪，进行了无数次的袭击和破坏活动，来妨碍阿尔巴尼亚人民的和平劳动。
    照会指出，南斯拉夫的机关曾于1958年8月在贝尔格莱德杀害了根据阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团颁布的大赦令、并带有正式文件回国的阿尔巴尼亚公民哈桑·斯帕塔。照会接着说，现在，它们又犯下了更加严重的罪行，这一次不是在贝尔格莱德，而是在阿尔巴尼亚国境之内，从而侵犯了阿尔巴尼亚的领土完整。
    众所周知，南斯拉夫政府窝藏着曾同法西斯和纳粹占领者勾结的阿尔巴尼亚罪犯，窝藏外国特务机关的特务、阴谋反对阿尔巴尼亚人民和人民政府的人，以及盗窃犯和其他普通罪犯。这些犯罪分子在南斯拉夫被组织起来并加以训练，为的是对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国进行敌对活动。许多业经公布的文件以及阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国对从南斯拉夫派到阿尔巴尼亚来的颠覆分子、间谍和破坏分子所进行的审讯，已经向世界舆论揭露了南斯拉夫机关的这一切敌对活动。
    照会指出，阿尔巴尼亚政府，曾经在不同的场合提请南斯拉夫政府注意上述情况，并要求它采取必要的措施，以便使南斯拉夫的机关停止这些同邻国间的正常关系不相容的、而且公然违背国际法准则和联合国宪章的敌对行动。但是，今年8月30日的罪恶挑衅表明，南斯拉夫的机关并没有放弃它们对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国和对阿尔巴尼亚人民的敌对行动。
    阿尔巴尼亚政府在抗议照会中指出了南斯拉夫政府对这一新的罪恶挑衅所负的重大责任，并再一次要求它采取措施来制止这种危险的活动。阿尔巴尼亚政府保留为上述挑衅的受害者向南斯拉夫政府要求赔偿损失的权利。
