Liu Ningyi Sends Telegram to the Cuban Workers' Federation

The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cuba marks a new stage in the friendship developed between our two peoples in the common struggle to resolutely safeguard national independence and peace and resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism. It marks a new development in the friendly relations between China and the people of Latin America and is also the most powerful rebuff to the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to undermine the unity between China and Cuba and the people of Latin America. Facts have once again proved that any conspiracy of imperialism can be defeated and will inevitably be defeated by the united struggle of the people.
