Xinhua News Agency, Khara Khorin, September 27th. The handover ceremony for the Khara Khorin canal irrigation project in the Front Hangai Province of Mongolia, and a rally celebrating the completion of the project, were held today at the Khara Khorin State Farm.

　　This irrigation project was constructed with China's gratuitous assistance to Mongolia.

　　The head of the Chinese government delegation, Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia Xie Fusheng, and the head of the Mongolian government delegation, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry of Mongolia, Dambadarjaa, signed the handover certificate.

　　In the afternoon of the same day, employees of the Khara Khorin State Farm held a celebration meeting. Among those attending the meeting were Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Mongolia, Maidar, Minister of Industry Damdin, and Chinese experts and employees who helped build the water conservancy project.

　　Maidar and Xie Fusheng spoke at the meeting successively.

　　Maidar said that on the eve of the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, during the "Mongolia-China Friendship Week" activities being carried out in various parts of Mongolia, the handover ceremony of the Khara Khorin canal irrigation project is a great happy event. This irrigation project is one of the major projects that China has helped Mongolia establish. The participation of Chinese engineering technicians and workers in Mongolia's socialist construction has greatly encouraged the Mongolian people.

　　Speaking about Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Mongolia, he said that it has taken the common cause of the two countries a big step forward, and at the same time, it is of great significance in consolidating the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and consolidating world peace. He said that the Chinese people's brotherly assistance to the Mongolian people has made a great contribution to promoting Mongolia's socialist construction. He finally expressed his gratitude to the Chinese technicians and workers who helped Mongolia build the water conservancy project.

　　Ambassador Xie Fusheng expressed in his speech the hope that the Khara Khorin canal irrigation project would play its due role in Mongolia's agriculture and socialist construction. He said that the Mongolian people have made brilliant achievements in socialist construction with their diligent labor. Chinese workers feel very honored to be able to contribute to Mongolia's socialist construction. This is our bounden internationalist duty. The Chinese and Mongolian peoples are sincerely supporting and helping each other for the common goal and the common cause. He wished the people of the two countries to make greater contributions in the struggle for the socialist construction of the two countries, for strengthening the strength of the socialist camp, and for opposing imperialism and defending world peace.

　　Finally, Maidar cut the ribbon. As the gate opened, the river water flowed through the canal. The Orkhon River has since been tamed and serves agricultural production. It will be able to irrigate more than 8,000 mu of farmland.

　　Today, the Presidium of the Great People's Hural of Mongolia and the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry awarded medals, badges, and certificates to 250 Chinese employees who participated in the construction of the water conservancy project.

    迈达尔和谢甫生先后在会上讲了话。
    迈达尔说，在中国建国十一周年前夕，在蒙古各地开展“蒙中友好旬”活动的期间，哈拉和林渠道灌溉工程举行交接仪式，这是一件大喜事。这个灌溉工程是中国帮助蒙古建立的大工程项目之一。中国工程技术人员和工人参加蒙古社会主义建设，给了蒙古人民以很大鼓舞。
