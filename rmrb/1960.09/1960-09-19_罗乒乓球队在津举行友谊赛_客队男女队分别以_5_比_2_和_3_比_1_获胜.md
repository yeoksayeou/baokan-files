Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 18th. The Romanian men's and women's table tennis teams held friendly matches with the Hebei Province men's and women's table tennis teams in Tianjin on the evening of the 17th. As a result, the visiting women's team won 3-1 and the men's team won 5-2.

The matches were tense and exciting. In the women's team event, three matches were decided after three games. Hebei's newcomer Ma Guanghong defeated Pitica 2-1 first. In the second match, Hebei's He Yunfu played against Alexandru. He Yunfu won the first game with a fierce offensive. The experienced Alexandru immediately changed her tactics, taking the opportunity to attack after steady chops, eventually turning defeat into victory and winning two games in a row. In the doubles, Ma Guanghong and He Yunfu cooperated well in the first game, leading all the way to victory. Alexandru and Pitica responded calmly, giving full play to their skills in both attack and defense, and won two games in a row. In another match, Pitica defeated He Yunfu 2-0.

In the men's team event, the visiting team featured the famous players, national champion Negulescu, third-place finisher Popescu, and junior champion Reti, who demonstrated skillful and varied techniques in the match. Hebei's team consisted of Wang Zhiliang, Xu Guoxing, and Wang Jiasheng. Wang Jiasheng, only seventeen years old and participating in an international competition for the first time, played relatively well in this match. Wang Jiasheng defeated the visiting team's veteran Popescu with his backhand fast push block combined with a sidespin forehand attack. Wang Jiasheng's match against Negulescu was also very close. In the first game, Negulescu won 21-9. Wang Jiasheng, having adapted to the opponent's style, took the initiative at the start of the second game, using long smashes and short lobs to force the opponent to run left and right, eventually winning 21-19. In the decisive third game, Wang Jiasheng led for most of the game, but after Negulescu successfully executed several smashes to tie the score at 14-14, Wang Jiasheng became somewhat impatient, making continuous errors in receiving the ball, and finally lost to the opponent 16-21.

    罗乒乓球队在津举行友谊赛
    客队男女队分别以5比2和3比1获胜
    新华社天津18日电　罗马尼亚男、女乒乓球队17日晚在天津与河北省男、女乒乓球队举行友谊比赛。结果客队女队以3比1和男队以5比2获胜。
    比赛紧张而又精采。在女子团体赛中，有三场都是打了三局才决定胜负。河北队新手马光泓先以2比1胜皮蒂卡。第二场河北队的何运富对亚历山德鲁时，何运富先以凌厉的攻势胜了第一局，经验丰富的亚历山德鲁立即改变打法，在稳削、稳搓当中伺机起板扣杀，结果转败为胜，连胜两局。在双打中，马光泓和何运富第一局合作较好，一路领先获胜，亚历山德鲁和皮蒂卡沉着应战，充分发挥了能攻善守的技巧，结果连胜两局。另一场，皮蒂卡以2比0胜何运富。
    在男子团体赛中，客队登场的是著名的选手、全国冠军内古莱斯库，季军波佩斯库和少年冠军雷蒂，他们在比赛中表现了熟练多变的技巧。河北队应战的是王志良、许国兴和王家声。第一次参加国际比赛的年仅十七岁的王家声，在这次比赛中打得比较出色。王家声以反手快速推挡配合侧身抢攻打法，战胜了客队老将波佩斯库。王家声对内古莱斯库的一场也打得难解难分：第一局；内古莱斯库以21比9取胜。开始适应了对方球路的王家声，第二局一开始就先发制人，长扣短吊，迫使对方左右奔跑，结果以21比19扳回一局。在决定胜负的第三局中，开始王家声一直领先，当内古莱斯库几次起板成功追至14平以后，由于王家声有些急躁，接球连续失误，最后16比21败给对方。
