    New Recruit's Diary (Two Poems)
    Li Ying
    Today I am so happy, the target loves me, I love the target, twice I hit the target dead center. After joining the army for a few months, I have developed good marksmanship. Today I climbed the target platform three times, the mountains applauded and laughed. The red flag indicating the target score waved up and down, I know what it's saying. Songs fly over the loess ridge, gunshots travel far and wide to my home. Stepping down from the target platform, I look up, and the red sun in front of me is like a fresh flower. The platoon leader smiled at me from afar, asking me to write a letter to my mother. I said not to rush, but in my heart—I really want to send her the good news quickly!
    Issuing Uniforms
    The whistle blows "di di", the whole team goes to collect new uniforms. Dense stitches, large pieces of cloth, the people's affection is immeasurable. The northern commune members plant cotton, the southern workers spin the yarn, cut them, make them, and send them thousands of miles to the barracks. Liberation shoes, pair after pair, sponge soles, like springs, rows of air vents are lovely, convenient for long marches. How many people shelter us from wind and rain, how many people work day and night for us, how many hands, how many drops of sweat, how many eyes are fixed on our sights. You look at me, I look at you, happily put them on. Wearing the uniform, we go in all directions, the people's kindness will never be forgotten. Ha, there's also a sewing kit in the pocket, and the pocket is full of the sound of knives and rulers; I straighten my chest and stomp my feet, shaking the earth and mountains!

    新兵日记（二首）
    李瑛今天我多么高兴靶爱我，我爱靶，两次打靶靶开花，入伍几个月，练就一身好枪法。今天三次登靶台，群山拍手笑哈哈，示靶的红旗飘上下，我知道它在说什么。歌声飞过黄土岭，枪响迢迢传到家，走下靶台昂头看，面前红日作鲜花。排长见我老远就笑，要我写信给妈妈，我说不忙，可心里呀——真想快把喜讯捎给她！
    发军装哨子吹得嘀嘀响，整队去领新军装，密密的针脚大大的布，人民的情意难估量。北方的社员种棉花，南方的工人把线纺，裁起来，做起来，千里万里送营房。解放鞋，一双双，海绵底，像弹簧，排排的气眼惹人爱，长途行军好便当。多少人为咱挡风雨，多少人为咱日夜忙，多少双手，多少滴汗，多少只眼盯在咱们准星上。你看看我，我看看你，欢欢喜喜穿身上，穿起军装走四方，人民的恩情永不忘。哈，口袋还有个针线包，口袋还装满刀尺响；我挺挺胸脯一跺脚，震得地动山摇晃！
