    Living Together	Sang Ji
    Since the implementation of the “two-five system” leadership method, a large number of cadres from counties, communes, and management districts have gone deep into the production teams, not only working and eating the same food as the masses but also settling down in farmers’ homes and living with them. They generally live in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, thereby establishing closer ties with the Party’s basic masses in the countryside.
    Cadres living with the masses is by no means a mere overnight stay; rather, it requires truly achieving a relationship “as close as family.” Many cadres who go down to the countryside live with the masses, treating the affairs of the masses’ families as their own and regarding the difficulties of the masses as their own. They help them arrange their lives and manage household affairs. When someone is sick, they seek medical treatment and deliver medicine, offering care and concern with meticulous attention. In their shared lives, the masses see that every word and deed of the cadres is genuinely for everyone’s benefit, just like for their own relatives, without the slightest hint of bureaucratic airs. At this time, the masses will also regard the cadres as confidants; they will treat the cadres even more warmly than their own relatives. The hearts of the cadres and the hearts of the masses melt together, and the masses will tell the cadres their innermost thoughts.
    Through living with the masses, cadres can gain a more in-depth and detailed understanding of the various issues facing the masses. We know that the masses include young people, adults, the elderly, women, and children. The practical problems of the masses are diverse, and their opinions and demands will also be diverse. Cadres working together with the masses can learn more about the ideological situation of young people and adults and can learn more about the problems in production; living with the masses, on the other hand, can help cadres gain a deeper understanding of the masses’ production sentiments from another perspective, can hear more reflections from the elderly, women, and children, and discover some problems in the actual lives of the masses, such as health and hygiene issues, childcare issues, housing issues, marriage issues, and even mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationships, sister-in-law relationships, and so on. Timely assistance to the masses in solving these practical problems will enable them to devote all their energy to production with greater ease of mind.
    Cadres eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses, learning about various aspects of the situation from all sides, will be more comprehensive, in-depth, and meticulous when thinking about problems, considering not only the needs of young people and adults but also some of the special needs of women, the elderly, and children; considering not only production issues but also not neglecting the diverse practical life issues of the masses. In this way, the methods and measures they propose will inevitably be more practical, production can be done better, and life can be arranged better.

    同住	桑基
    推行“二五制”领导方法以来，大批县、公社、管理区的干部深入到生产小队，不仅和群众一起劳动，吃一样的饭，而且还到农民家里落户，和群众同住。他们一般都住到贫农、下中农的家里，从而同党在农村中的基本群众建立起更密切的联系。
    干部和群众同住，决不是一般的借宿，而是要真正做到“亲如家人”。许多下去的干部和群众生活在一起，把群众家里的事情当成自己的事情，把群众的困难看作自己的困难，帮助他们安排生活，料理家务，有人生病，就求医送药，问寒问暖，照顾的无微不至。在共同生活中，群众看到干部的一言一行一举一动，无不是真心实意为大家，就像对自己的亲人一样，没有半点干部架子。这时，群众也就会把干部当成知心人，他们对待干部甚至会比自己的亲人还亲。干部的心和群众的心溶化在一起，群众也就会把知心话告诉干部。
    通过和群众同住，可以帮助干部更加深入细致地了解到群众各方面的问题。我们知道，群众有青年、壮年，也有老人、妇女、小孩。群众的实际问题是多种多样的，意见和要求也会是多种多样的。干部和群众一起劳动，可以更多地了解到青年、壮年的思想情况，可以更多地了解到生产中的问题；和群众同住，则可以帮助干部从另一个方面深入了解群众的生产情绪，可以更多地听到老人、妇女和小孩的反映，发现群众实际生活上的一些问题，如疾病卫生问题，托儿问题，住房问题，婚姻问题，甚至婆媳关系，妯娌关系，等等。及时地帮助群众解决这些实际问题，就能使群众更加心情舒畅地把自己的全部精力放到生产上去。
    干部和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，从各个侧面了解到多方面的情况，思考问题的时候就会更加全面、深入、细致，既考虑到青年、壮年的需要，也考虑到妇女、老人和小孩的一些特殊需要；既考虑生产问题，也不忽视群众多种多样的实际生活问题。这样，他们提出的办法、措施就必然更加切合实际，生产就可以搞得更好，生活也可以安排得更好。
