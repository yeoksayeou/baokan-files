Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 5th. The Yutianpu Coal Mine in Chongqing has been carrying forward the spirit of continuous revolution, solving the new problems that have arisen one by one after the implementation of the "Underground Office" system, so that the new system has been further consolidated and improved, and has powerfully promoted production. The mine's coal mining, tunneling, and coke production in August all increased significantly compared to July.

At the beginning of the implementation of the "Underground Office" system, more than 90% of the mine's cadres rushed to the front line of production, strengthening leadership over production. However, some departments and offices did not properly arrange their business work because too many people went down, and the second-line work once lagged behind the first-line production. In order to solve this problem, the mine party committee readjusted the cadres on the second and first lines. One secretary and two members of the mine party committee, along with 20% of the cadres from departments and offices, took turns dealing with daily business on the second line, so that the second-line work was closely linked with the first-line work. In order to do a good job on the second line with fewer people and more work, various departments and offices vigorously reformed their business according to the characteristics of underground production. For example, since the Production Technology Section delegated part of the authority to formulate and approve operating procedures to the work groups, it reduced a lot of administrative work. After 80% of the cadres went to the front line of production, the remaining cadres working on the second line also excellently completed their tasks.

While solving the problems in the second-line work, the mine also adopted the method of "going down (to the work groups for fixed settlement), contracting (contracting a working face), and pushing production up within a time limit," following the principle of business alignment and specialized use, with departments and offices as units, to implement "four guarantees" (guarantee production, guarantee ideology, guarantee technological innovation, guarantee safety) on one working face. The cadres of each department and office have all formulated plans to go deep into the front line of production, and earnestly solve the key problems in the front line of production. After the deputy secretary of the mine party committee and the cadres of the propaganda department went to the No. 2 mine, they studied with the workers to address the problem of electric chutes being prone to accidents and established a regular inspection and maintenance system. The "three fixings" (fixed personnel, fixed location, fixed motor) were implemented among electric chute drivers to strengthen the sense of responsibility of electric chute drivers, turning the sixteen electric chutes in the No. 2 mine into a group of safely operating electric chutes. Since July, the coal output of this mine has increased a lot compared to before, and two working faces have successively reached the level of red flag working faces.

The cadres of various departments and offices contracted a working face each, eating, living, working, and discussing with the workers, which not only improved production but also created concrete experiences for the work of each department and office, which also played a great role in improving the business level of the offices. For example, in participating in and leading production, the cadres of the Finance Section helped the key work groups create experience in economic accounting. After it was promoted throughout the mine, a mass-based economic accounting network for the mine, well, group, and shift was established and improved, which further improved the financial work of the mine, and the cost of raw coal decreased month by month. Cadres from the Geological Survey Section, combined with their own business, went to the fifth coal mining group with the worst geological conditions, consulted with the workers, found the laws of bad geological conditions, actively improved roof management methods, improved operating procedures, and timely summarized a set of roof management experience, which has great guiding significance for the safe production of various working faces in the mine.

    一个一个切实解决推行新制度后的新问题
    鱼田堡煤矿井下办公制日益完善
    干部深入基层经常化  一线、二线工作井井有条  煤焦生产持续增长
    据新华社重庆5日电　重庆市鱼田堡煤矿发扬不断革命精神，一个一个地解决推行“井下办公”制度以后出现的新问题，使新制度得到进一步巩固和提高，有力地推动了生产。全矿8月份采煤、掘进和焦炭生产都比7月份增长很多。
    这个煤矿在实行“井下办公”制度初期，全矿90％以上的干部都奔赴生产第一线，加强了对生产的领导。可是有些部门和科室由于下去的人太多，业务工作没有妥善安排，第二线工作一度出现跟不上生产第一线现象。矿党委为了解决这个问题，把在第二线和第一线的干部重新作了调整。矿党委有一个书记、两个委员，科室有20％的干部轮流在第二线处理日常业务，使第二线工作同第一线工作紧密结合。各部门和科室在人少工作多的情况下，为把第二线工作搞好，根据井下生产特点，大力改革了科室业务。例如生产技术科自从把制定和审批作业规程的部分权力下放给小组以后，减少了许多事务性工作，80％的干部深入生产第一线以后，其余在第二线工作的干部也出色地完成了任务。
    这个煤矿在解决第二线工作中的问题的同时，还采取“放下去（到小组去定点落户）、包起来（包一个工作面）、把生产限期突上去”的办法，按照业务对口、专长专用的原则，以部门和科室为单位，分别到一个工作面实行“四包”（包生产、包思想、包技术革新、包安全）。各部门和科室的干部都订了深入生产第一线的规划，扎扎实实地解决生产第一线的关键问题。矿党委副书记和宣传部的干部下到二井以后，针对电溜子容易发生事故的问题，跟职工群众一道研究，建立了定期检修和维护制度。在电溜子司机中实行“三定”（定人、定点、定机头），加强了电溜子司机的责任心，把二井十六部电溜子变成了安全运转的电溜子群。7月份以来，这个矿井的煤产量比以前提高很多，有两个工作面先后达到了红旗工作面的水平。
    各部门和科室干部分别包一个工作面，跟工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，既搞好了生产，又创造了各个部门和科室工作的具体经验，对提高科室的业务工作水平也起了很大作用。例如财务科的干部在参加生产、领导生产中，帮助重点小组创造了经济核算工作的经验，在全矿推广后，建立、健全了群众性的矿、井、组、班经济核算网，使全矿财务工作进一步改进，原煤成本月月下降。地质测量科的干部结合本身业务，深入地质条件最坏的第五采煤小组，跟工人共同商量，找到地质条件坏的规律，积极改进顶板管理方法，健全了操作规程，并及时总结出一套管理顶板的经验，对全矿各工作面的安全生产有很大指导作用。（附图片）
