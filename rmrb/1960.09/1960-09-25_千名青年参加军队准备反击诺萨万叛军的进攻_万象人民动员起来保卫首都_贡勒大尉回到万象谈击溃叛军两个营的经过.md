　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 24th – According to a broadcast today by the Lao Fighting Forces Radio, people from all walks of life in Vientiane, the capital of Laos, are enthusiastically participating in actions to defend Vientiane. One thousand young people have joined the army, and office workers are voluntarily guarding their institutions to prevent sabotage.

　　The radio station said that the people of the whole country warmly welcome the heroic spirit of the Vientiane troops and people in resolutely fighting and defeating the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak reactionary group and defending the capital.

　　The radio station also said that after the Phoumi Nosavan rebel army was defeated in Pakxan, it fled across the river to Peng Khan County in Thailand. The government army in Vientiane is now prepared to counter the offensive of the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak group.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 23rd – According to a broadcast by Vientiane Radio tonight, Captain Kong Le, who recently returned to Vientiane after directing the victory in the Battle of Pakxan, told reporters today that the Second Parachute Battalion under his command defeated two battalions of troops led by the traitor Phoumi Nosavan with only two companies of soldiers.

　　He said that in the battle to recover Pakxan, in addition to many deaths, seventy rebels were captured. The government army seized a large number of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies.

　　Kong Le said that when the rebel army retreated from the area north of Pakxan towards Pakxan, they destroyed bridges. The government army crossed the river in pursuit and launched a four-sided encirclement. He said that part of the defeated rebel army had crossed the Mekong River and fled into Thailand, and part had fled into the forests.

　　It is reported that the Lao Royal Army ended the battle to recover Pakxan in the early morning of the 22nd after forty-eight hours of fighting. It was previously reported that the Phoumi Nosavan group rebels, with the support of Thailand, occupied Pakxan through Thai territory.

　　According to Western news agencies, citing Phoumi Nosavan's radio broadcast, the rebel army has retreated to Muong Kieu, east of Pakxan. Unwilling to accept defeat, Phoumi Nosavan has ordered this defeated army to prepare for a counterattack against Pakxan.

　　Vientiane Radio also broadcast today an appeal issued by the General Headquarters of the Lao Royal Army on the 22nd, calling on the rebel officers and soldiers who were deceived by certain policies and occupied Pakxan in preparation for attacking Vientiane to surrender to the local authorities with their weapons. The appeal stated that the General Headquarters of the Royal Army will guarantee their safety. The appeal also stated that in order to enable them to see the facts clearly, the General Headquarters of the Royal Army and the Phouma government have called on the Royal Army and the Lao Fighting Forces, as well as local authorities in various regions, to be ready to receive them at any time and provide them with preferential treatment and convenience in all aspects.
