　　Same Labor

The more than 3,700 county, commune, and brigade cadres and masses in Fengcheng County, Jiangxi, have implemented the "Four Same's," leading the masses to manage the autumn fields more meticulously, proving that "same labor" in participating in production and leading production is an important "same" among the "Four Same's."

　　Same labor is both a matter of mass viewpoint and a matter of leadership method. The purpose of same labor is to improve leadership style, improve working methods, go deep among the masses, go deep into reality, and through participating in production, promptly discover problems, promptly solve key problems in production, and effectively lead production. Sun Longfu, Deputy Secretary of the Fengcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, discovered when working alongside commune members in Shitan Commune that some people were still weeding the fields by hand and that some were not actively using weeding tools. After further investigation, he found that the weeding tools had the disadvantage of not weeding cleanly. After a crash modification, a palm-shaped weeding tool that could weed two or three rows at a time was made. This tool not only weeded quickly and cleanly, but was also flexible and easy to use, greatly accelerating the progress of weeding. The reason why Sun Longfu was able to discover and improve the weeding tool was mainly because he engaged in "same labor" with the masses. Without same labor, he would not have discovered that the masses were weeding by hand, and he would not have been able to improve the tools in time to accelerate the weeding progress. Therefore, the masses gave a lot of praise to the cadres who were sent down for participating in production and leading production through same labor. The masses said: "When the leaders come down, production goes up," "When cadres go to the fields, the crops undergo great changes"; this is a vivid illustration of same labor.

　　From the facts of the vast number of cadres and masses in Fengcheng County, Jiangxi, implementing the "Four Same's" and fighting hard in the fields, we can gain a very important experience. That is, leading cadres must first take off their shoes and go to the fields, so that their feet are in the fields, their hands are in the fields, and their brains are also "in the fields." If they only eat and live with the masses, but cannot participate in production labor with the masses, then the masses will feel that they have not completely integrated with them, and of course it will be impossible to truly understand the key problems in production, and it will be impossible to solve the key problems in production. However, taking off shoes and going to the fields does not mean that the key problems in production have been solved. There are also two situations of taking off shoes and going to the fields: one is that the feet are in the fields, the hands are also in the fields, but the brain is not "in the fields," so they cannot discover problems and solve problems. This is an incomplete removal of shoes and going to the fields. The other is that the feet and hands are in the fields, and the brain is also "in the fields," closely contacting the masses, listening to, analyzing, and concentrating the opinions of the masses, actively supporting the advanced, publicizing the advanced, and effectively mobilizing and organizing the masses, effectively solving the ideological and practical problems of the masses. This is a complete "taking off shoes and going to the fields," a true going deep among the masses and deep into reality. The cadres of Fengcheng County, Jiangxi, have adopted the latter method of taking off shoes and going to the fields, so they can effectively participate in production and lead production in the same labor. This style of "taking off shoes and going to the fields" should be greatly promoted and developed in the current situation of vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain production.

　　同劳动
　　桑基
    江西丰城县三千七百多名县、公社、大队干部和群众实行“四同”，领导群众更细致地搞好秋田管理，证明参加生产领导生产中的“同劳动”是“四同”中的重要一“同”。
    同劳动既是一个群众观点问题，也是一个领导方法问题。同劳动的目的是，改进领导作风，改进工作方法，深入群众，深入实际，通过参加生产，及时发现问题，及时解决生产中的一个个关键问题，切实领导好生产。中共江西丰城县委副书记孙隆富在石滩公社和社员同劳动时，发现部分人仍旧用手耘田和有人使用耘禾工具不够积极的问题。他深入一了解，原来是耘禾工具有耘草不净的缺点。经过突击改装，制成了一种一次能耘两三行的掌形耘禾工具。这种工具不仅耘草又快又净，而且使用灵活轻便，大大加快了耘田进度。孙隆富所以能够发现和改进耘禾工具，主要是因为他和群众“同劳动”。如果没有同劳动，那就不会发现群众用手耘田，也就不能及时改进工具，加快耘田进度。因此，群众对于下放干部通过同劳动切实地参加生产领导生产，给予了很多赞扬。群众说：“领导下来，生产上去”，“干部到田间，庄稼大变样”；这就是对于同劳动的生动说明。
    从江西丰城县广大干部和群众实行“四同”，奋战田间的事实中，我们可以获得一条很重要的经验。这就是领导干部首先要脱鞋下田，做到脚下田，手下田，脑也“下田”。如果只是和群众同吃、同住，而不能和群众一起参加生产劳动，那么，群众会认为没有和他们完全打成一片，这当然就不可能真正地了解生产中的关键问题，也就不可能解决生产中的关键问题。但是，脱鞋下田，并不等于解决了生产中的关键问题。脱鞋下田也有两种情况：一种是脚下了田，手也下了田，脑没有“下田”，因而不能发现问题和解决问题。这是不完全的脱鞋下田。另一种是脚、手下田，脑也“下田”，密切地联系群众，倾听、分析和集中群众的意见，积极支持先进，宣扬先进，切实地发动和组织群众，有效地解决群众的思想问题和实际问题，这是完完全全的“脱鞋下田”，是真正的深入群众，深入实际。江西丰城县的干部采取的是后一种脱鞋下田的办法，所以能够在同劳动中做到切实参加生产，领导生产。这种“脱鞋下田”的作风，在当前大办农业、大办粮食的情况下，应该大大地加以提倡与发扬。
