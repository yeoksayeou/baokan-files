Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 25th: The Lao Fighting Forces Radio published a commentary on the 24th, pointing out that the Lao issue must be resolved by the Lao people themselves, and if foreign interference occurs, it must be resolved on the basis of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. The commentary also called on the people to be vigilant against the conspiracies of US imperialism to interfere in Laos through the United Nations and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

　　The commentary pointed out that the fundamental reason for the frequent unrest in Laos since 1954 is that US imperialism and its running dogs have tried every possible means to undermine the Geneva Accords and destroy Laos' policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony.

　　The commentary said that since the coup on August 9th overthrew the reactionary government of US imperialist running dogs, Phoumi Nosavan-Somsanith, and established the legitimate Phouma government, the Phouma government and the Lao Patriotic Front were prepared to hold peaceful negotiations in order to implement national harmony and unify the motherland on the basis of the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. However, US imperialism and the running dogs of its aggressive bloc in Southeast Asia, especially the reactionary governments of Thailand and South Vietnam, have greatly interfered in Laos. They instigated the Phoumi-Nosavan group to attack Vientiane; conspired to unilaterally establish a so-called "National Assembly" to draft a "constitution" in line with their intentions; and clamored to abandon the Kingdom's Constitution and establish a Phoumi-Boun Oum dictatorial system to serve as a powerful tool for US imperialism.

　　The commentary emphasized that in the face of the above situation, the Royal Government and the people must unite as one. The Royal Government must rely on the united strength of the people to crush any attacks by the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous group and oppose the interference of US imperialism and the Thai government. The Royal Government and the people should demand that the International Supervisory and Control Commission established in accordance with the 1954 Geneva Accords resume its activities in Laos to help Laos stop the interference of US imperialism. Only in this way can it be guaranteed that Laos follows the path of peace and neutrality, maintains Laos' independence and unity, and thus satisfies the wishes of all the Lao people.

　　In exposing the US imperialism and the Thai reactionary government's attempt to interfere in Laos through the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the commentary pointed out that it is well known that the Southeast Asia military aggressive bloc is a tool for US imperialism to realize its aggressive conspiracy in the Southeast Asian region, and it must not be allowed to interfere in Laos' internal affairs. Therefore, the Lao people support the Royal Government's opposition to the Phoumi-Boun Oum rebellious group's behavior of paving the way for the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc to invade Laos.

　　The commentary emphasized that the intention to request "UN forces" to enter Laos to stop the invasion of the Thai reactionary government and help negotiate with the Phoumi-Boun Oum group is very dangerous. The commentary said that introducing "UN forces" into Laos is equivalent to tearing up the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, which will make it impossible for the Phouma government's policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony to be realized.

　　The commentary said that everyone knows that the United Nations is a place for US imperialism to carry out its activities, and it will use some member states of the United Nations to oppose the interests of weak countries. The commentary cited the fact that US imperialism carried out conspiracies in the United Nations Security Council last year and sent a United Nations "Investigative Subcommittee" to interfere in Laos' internal affairs, saying that it was US imperialism that used this subcommittee as a means to import a large number of weapons and hundreds of military advisers into Laos, thereby controlling the Kingdom's army. The United Nations "Investigative Subcommittee" and the United Nations Secretary-General did not say a word about this interference by US imperialism. Therefore, it can be said that the United Nations organization sings the same tune as US imperialism, and the United Nations' interference in Laos will inevitably make the situation in Laos more serious and make Laos subject to more severe control by US imperialism.

　　The commentary said that the current situation in the Congo is precisely a lesson for the Lao people to learn from. Imperialism took advantage of the opportunity of "UN forces" entering the Congo to help Belgian colonialists and their running dogs split the Congo, oppose the legitimate Lumumba government and its peaceful and neutral line, and subvert the Lumumba government, causing the situation in the Congo to become increasingly serious.

　　The commentary pointed out that if the conspiracy of US imperialism and the Phoumi-Nosavan group to attack Vientiane and introduce the troops of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc into Laos fails, they will also use the United Nations to help them interfere in Laos. Therefore, allowing United Nations forces to enter Laos is undoubtedly falling into the enemy's trap. Once this trick succeeds, the situation in Laos will worsen, and the Phouma government's policy of peace and neutrality will be threatened as a result.

　　The commentary pointed out that if Laos is to restore peace, it must be resolved on the basis of fully implementing the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, and at the same time, a firm struggle must be waged against all reactionary forces that threaten and violate these agreements. It said that in accordance with the spirit of these agreements, the affairs of the Lao people themselves must be resolved through peaceful consultations among themselves. If it cannot be resolved peacefully, especially when it is subject to foreign interference, it must be resolved with the help of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, the signatory countries of the Geneva Accords, and the International Commission established in accordance with the Geneva Accords. Any method of solving the Lao problem that deviates from the Geneva Accords is incorrect and unfavorable to Laos.

    寮国战斗部队电台评老挝局势
　　必须依靠人民力量粉碎叛乱
　　强调吸取刚果局势教训警惕美国假手联合国进行干涉
    新华社河内25日电　寮国战斗部队电台24日发表评论，指出老挝问题必须由老挝人自己来解决，如果遭到外来干涉，就必须在日内瓦协议和万象协议的基础上加以解决。评论还呼吁人民警惕美帝国主义企图通过联合国和东南亚条约军事集团干涉老挝的阴谋。
    评论指出，自1954年以来老挝局势经常动荡不安的根本原因，是由于美帝国主义及其走狗千方百计地破坏日内瓦协议，破坏老挝的和平中立和民族和睦政策。
    评论说，自8月9日政变推翻了美帝国主义走狗松萨尼特—诺萨万反动政府，成立了合法的富马政府后，富马政府和老挝爱国战线党便准备举行和平谈判，以便在日内瓦协议和万象协议的基础上，实行民族和睦和统一祖国。但是美帝国主义及其在东南亚侵略集团的走狗，特别是泰国和越南南方的反动政府却大肆干涉老挝。它们唆使富米·诺萨万集团进攻万象；阴谋片面成立所谓“国民议会”来起草符合它们意图的“宪法”；扬言背弃王国宪法，建立富米—文翁独裁制度，以充当美帝国主义的得力工具。
    评论强调说，面对上述情况，王国政府和人民必须团结一致。王国政府必须依靠人民的团结力量来粉碎富米—文翁叛国集团的任何进攻，反对美帝国主义和泰国政府的干涉。王国政府和人民应该要求根据1954年日内瓦协议成立的国际监督和监察委员会恢复它在老挝的活动，帮助老挝制止美帝国主义的干涉。只有这样，才能保证老挝遵循和平中立的道路，维护老挝的独立和统一，从而满足全体老挝人民的愿望。
    评论在揭露美帝国主义和泰国反动政府企图通过东南亚条约组织干涉老挝时指出，众所周知，东南亚军事侵略集团是美帝国主义对东南亚地区实现它的侵略阴谋的工具，决不能允许它干涉老挝的内部事务。因此，老挝人民支持王国政府反对富米—文翁叛乱集团为东南亚侵略集团侵略老挝开辟道路的行为。
    评论强调指出，关于要求“联合国军队”进入老挝以制止泰国反动政府的入侵，并帮助同富米—文翁集团进行谈判的意图，是非常危险的。评论说，把“联合国军”引进老挝，就等于撕毁日内瓦协议和万象协议，这将使富马政府的和平中立和民族和睦政策无法实现。
    评论说，大家都知道，联合国是美帝国主义活动的场所，它将利用联合国某些会员国来反对弱小国家的利益。评论举出去年美帝国主义在联合国安全理事会中进行阴谋活动，派遣联合国“调查小组委员会”干涉老挝内政的事实说，正是美帝国主义利用这个小组委员会作为一种手段，向老挝输入大量武器和成百名军事顾问，从而控制了王国军队。对于美帝国主义的这种干涉行为，联合国“调查小组委员会”和联合国秘书长却只字不提。因此可以说，联合国的组织同美帝国主义是一个鼻孔出气的，联合国对老挝的干涉必将使老挝局势更加严重，使老挝受到美帝国主义的更严重的控制。
    评论说，当前的刚果局势正是老挝人民要好好吸取经验的借镜。帝国主义利用“联合国军”进入刚果的机会，帮助比利时殖民者及其走狗分裂刚果，反对合法的卢蒙巴政府及其和平中立路线，并且进行颠复卢蒙巴政府，促使刚果局势日益严重。
    评论指出，在老挝，美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万集团攻打万象和把东南亚侵略集团的军队引进老挝的阴谋如果遭到失败，它们也会利用联合国帮助它们干涉老挝。因此，让联合国军队进入老挝，无疑是中了敌人的诡计。这种诡计一旦得逞的话，老挝局势将会更加恶化，富马政府的和平中立政策也会因此而受到威胁。
    评论指出，如果要老挝恢复安宁，必须在充分履行日内瓦协议和万象协议的基础上加以解决，同时必须对威胁和侵犯这些协议的一切反动势力采取坚决斗争的态度。它说，按照这些协议的精神，老挝人自己的事情必须经过自己和平协商的途径来加以解决。如果不能和平解决，特别是受到外国的干涉时，就必须借助于日内瓦会议两主席、日内瓦协议签字国和根据日内瓦协议设立的国际委员会加以解决。离开日内瓦协议来解决老挝问题的一切办法都是不正确的，都是不利于老挝的。
