Xiaotun Brigade Manages Autumn Vegetables Meticulously, Resulting in Good Growth

Main experiences:

I. Measures are implemented down to the individual, organizing old farmers, technicians, and cadres to brainstorm, find solutions, and take action.
II. Brigade leaders go deep into the front lines, summarizing experiences with the masses during labor and promoting them promptly.

According to a Beijing Daily report, people who have visited Xiaotun Brigade of Lugouqiao Commune in Fengtai District, Beijing, praise their meticulous management and good growth of autumn vegetables. Although there has been no thorough rain for a long time, all 5,600 mu of autumn vegetables are adequately watered; the vast majority of plots have complete and strong seedlings, and weeds and pests are eliminated in a timely manner; where there are individual cases of missing seedlings, the commune members are hurrying to replant. The commune members are determined to ensure complete and strong seedlings, striving for good growth and high yields per mu for every autumn vegetable plant.

Why is the large area of autumn vegetables in this brigade managed relatively well? The main experiences are two: one is to boldly mobilize the masses, organizing old farmers, technicians, and cadres to meet in the fields for regular inspections and evaluations; the other is that brigade leaders go deep into the front lines, summarizing field management experiences with grassroots cadres and commune members during labor and promoting them promptly. In particular, they have strengthened leadership over individual backward teams, helping them to brainstorm ideas, formulate measures, and fully unleash the enthusiasm of the vast numbers of commune members, so that their work can quickly catch up with the level of advanced teams.

After the basic completion of autumn vegetable sowing, the brigade immediately launched a field management campaign centered on ensuring complete and strong seedlings. Up to now, three mass inspections have been carried out. Each inspection has a main focus, and according to the growth of autumn vegetables at each stage, specific content for the next evaluation and inspection is proposed, so that each team has clear goals, resolute actions, meticulousness, and tight links in management. In the first inspection on August 8, pests were found in more than 300 mu of vegetable fields, so it was decided that the second inspection should check the elimination of pests. The next morning, the commune members went to the fields to spray pesticides, taking the method of focusing on controlling and preventing universally. Except for the autumn vegetables intercropped in the cornfields, which were inconvenient to spray, more than 2,000 mu were sprayed in two days. By the time of the second comprehensive inspection on August 18, the original pests had been completely eliminated; at this time, it was discovered that some Chinese cabbages intercropped in the cornfields had also been infested with pests, so a pest control blitz day was launched on the 19th.

During each inspection, old farmers, technicians, and cadres at all levels responsible for vegetable fields are organized to participate. The three parties face each other, discover problems on the spot, analyze the causes on the spot, come up with solutions, and solve them on the spot, without letting problems "overnight." For example, when checking seedling emergence for the first time, it was found that 25 mu of upland Chinese cabbage in the Dawayao Production Team had not been watered immediately after sowing, resulting in many missing seedlings and severe pest damage. It was decided on the spot to replant all of them, with Lu Ying, the secretary of the Party branch, participating. It was completed in one day, and now the seedlings are complete and strong again.

Since the autumn vegetable sowing, the brigade's leading cadres have consistently gone deep into the twelve production teams, laboring with the commune members on the front line, summarizing past management experiences together, and proposing a complete set of management measures, especially mastering the seedling spacing and water and fertilizer "timing" according to local conditions. For example, in the sandy soil of Dawayao, which is prone to water and fertilizer leakage, the Chinese cabbage does not grow large, and more seedlings must be retained, watered frequently, and top-dressed frequently to achieve high yields. After full discussion by the commune members, it was decided to thin the Chinese cabbage to 2,800 to 2,900 plants per mu; apply fertilizer five or six times, and water eight or nine times. In the yellow soil and black soil of Xiaowayao, the soil quality is good and the fertility is sufficient. If the seedlings are left too densely, it will affect the growth of large plants. After discussion by the commune members, it was decided to thin the Chinese cabbage to 2,300 to 2,400 plants per mu, water seven or eight times in a timely manner, and apply fertilizer four or five times. In thinning and other management activities, each team has implemented the method of assigning responsibilities to groups, implementing measures to the fields, and fixing quotas to the end, so that each vegetable field has a special group and a special person responsible, and each activity has quantity and quality requirements. In order to ensure the quality of the activities, commune members often inspect each other and exchange experiences. Currently, they generally thin and set seedlings in the afternoon to avoid exposure to the hot sun at noon, which can cause root damage and disease in the Chinese cabbage.

Because the brigade cadres promptly listened to the opinions of the masses and summarized and promoted these experiences, the vegetable seedlings grew better and better, and the commune members became more and more motivated. The Xiaowayao Production Team's autumn vegetable management was not good enough in the past. After several inspections and evaluations, the autumn vegetables are now generally complete and strong, and the Chinese cabbage has already formed heads, becoming one of the top production teams in the entire brigade.

### 小屯大队秋菜管得细长得好

    小屯大队秋菜管得细长得好
    主要经验：
    一，措施落实到人，组织老农、技术员、干部一起出主意、想办法、动手干
    二，大队领导干部深入第一线，在劳动中同群众一起总结经验，及时推广
    据北京日报消息　到过北京市郊丰台区芦沟桥公社小屯大队的人，都称赞他们的秋菜管得细、长得好。这里虽然较长时间没下过透雨，可是五千六百多亩秋菜，块块不缺水；绝大部分地块苗全苗壮，杂草和病虫害都被及时消灭掉；个别地方有缺苗现象，社员们正在抓紧补栽。社员们决心保证苗全苗壮，力争秋菜棵棵长得好，亩亩高产丰收。
    这个大队的大面积秋菜为什么管理得比较好？主要经验有两条：一条是放手发动群众，组织老农、技术员和干部会师田间，定期检查评比；一条是大队领导干部深入第一线，在劳动中和基层干部、社员一起总结田间管理经验，及时推广。尤其是加强了对个别后进队的领导，帮助他们出主意、订措施，充分发挥广大社员的积极性，使他们的工作迅速赶上先进队的水平。
    这个大队在秋菜播种基本结束以后，立即开展了以保证苗全、苗壮为中心的田间管理运动。到现在，已经进行了三次群众性的大检查，每一次检查都有一个主要内容，同时根据各个时期的秋菜生长情况，提出下一次评比检查的具体内容，使各队在管理上目标明确、行动坚决，一丝不苟，环环扣紧。在8月8日第一次检查中，有三百多亩菜田发现虫害，于是决定第二次就要检查消灭虫害的情况。第二天清晨，社员们就顶着露水下田喷药，采取重点除治、普遍预防的方法，除了玉米地套种的秋菜不便打药外，两天喷药两千多亩。到18日第二次全面检查的时候，原有的虫害已经全部消灭；这时又发现有些玉米地套种的大白菜也发生了虫害，于是又在19日开展了灭虫突击日。
    在每次检查的时候，都组织老农、技术员和各级管菜田的干部参加，三头对面，现场发现问题，就地分析原因，拿出办法，当场解决，不使问题“过夜”。如第一次检查出苗情况的时候，发现大瓦窑生产队有二十五亩高岗地大白菜没有随种随浇，缺苗很多，虫害较重，就当场决定全部重种，由党总支书记芦英参加，一天种完，现在菜苗又齐又壮。
    这个大队的领导干部，从秋菜播种到现在，始终分别深入到十二个生产队，在第一线上和社员一起劳动，一起总结往年的管理经验，提出了一整套管理措施，特别是因地制宜地掌握留苗规格和水、肥“火候”。像大瓦窑一带容易漏水漏肥的沙土地，白菜不长大棵，必须多留苗、勤浇水、勤追肥才能高产；经过社员充分讨论，决定每亩大白菜定苗二千八、九百棵；追五、六次肥，浇八、九次水。像小瓦窑一带的黄土地和黑土地，土质好、肥力足，如果留苗过密，反而影响长大棵，经过社员讨论，决定每亩大白菜定苗二千三、四百棵，适时浇水七、八次，追肥四、五次。在定苗和其它管理活动中，各队都实行了责任到组、措施到田、定额一包到底的办法，使块块菜田都有专组专人负责，样样活茬都有数量、质量要求。社员们为了保证活茬质量，经常互相检查和交流经验，当前一般的都在下午间苗、定苗，避免中午烈日曝晒，使大白菜伤根受病。
    由于大队干部及时倾听群众意见，总结和推广了这些经验，所以菜苗越长越好，社员越干劲头越足。小瓦窑生产队以前的秋菜管理不够好，经过几次检查评比，现在秋菜普遍苗全苗壮，大白菜已经团棵，一跃成为全大队的上游生产队。
