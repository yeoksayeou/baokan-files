Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 4th: Workers and staff of all factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company are systematically summarizing and promoting advanced operational experiences. Through technical innovation and technical revolution, they are vigorously tackling the current key to production, so that the production increase and economy practice plans are rapidly implemented in every furnace and every shift. A climax of production increase and economy practice competition centered on increasing steel production is rapidly forming in various factories and mines.

At the beginning of this production increase and economy practice campaign, workers and staff of all factories and mines in Anshan set off a wave of checking and summarizing the work experience of the previous seven months and discussing and formulating production increase targets and specific measures for the next four months. During the days of discussing the plans, the workers were in high spirits. Many people automatically gathered around the furnaces, rolling mills, and power shovels after work, without even taking off their work clothes, to study equipment potential and key production issues, and to find measures to solve key problems. Many units' key production challenges were immediately taken up as soon as they were posted on the "attack" boards; many shifts sent representatives to advanced furnaces and advanced shifts to "learn from the scriptures" and issue "battle reports," launching head-to-head competitions. After extensive, in-depth, and detailed discussions, Anshan's production plans for the next four months have been implemented in every open-hearth furnace and blast furnace, every power shovel and rolling mill. Every shift and individual has formulated measures to achieve the plans on a shift-by-shift and day-by-day basis and has quickly launched the competition.

Many factories and mines, open-hearth furnaces, and blast furnaces have summarized and promoted a number of effective advanced experiences. The workers and staff regard these advanced experiences as a reliable guarantee for fulfilling and over-fulfilling the production plans for the next four months. The workers of the No. 9 open-hearth furnace of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, due to their persistence in carrying out the "relay race" between the four shifts in the first half of the year, made the four shifts unite and over-fulfill the plan every month. This time, when they discussed the plan, they implemented a system of "fixed personnel, fixed parts" to maintain the furnace bottom, further supplementing and enriching the experience of the four-shift "relay race," further increasing the output of each furnace of steel, and realizing the double leap forward of "more charging" and "faster smelting." As soon as this experience appeared, it attracted the workers of all open-hearth furnaces in the plant, immediately setting off a competition craze to learn from, catch up with, and surpass the No. 9 open-hearth furnace. Almost all open-hearth furnaces quickly promoted the advanced experience of the No. 9 open-hearth furnace's "fixed personnel, fixed parts" maintenance of the furnace body and the four-shift "relay race."

Workers and staff of all factories and mines, through technical innovation and technical revolution, are vigorously tackling the current key to production, clearing the way for achieving production increase and economy practice targets. After overcoming the floods and restoring production, the workers and staff of the Ironmaking Plant launched a vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution, targeting the key problem of the slow turnover of molten iron tank lids. Liu Diansheng, the leader of the Class A furnace front group of the No. 4 blast furnace, and Liu Mokai, the deputy leader of the Class D furnace front group, researched a method to prevent slag and sand from running into the molten iron tank, effectively overcoming the key to molten iron tank lid condensation. After this technical innovation achievement was quickly promoted on all blast furnaces in the plant, it guaranteed the on-time tapping of iron from the blast furnaces. In production, the "Fierce Tiger" drilling team of the East Anshan Iron Mine, on the one hand, seized the three hours of blasting to make all preparations and shorten the auxiliary time as much as possible; on the other hand, they improved the distribution position of the blast holes to give full play to the power of each blast, reducing the number of holes per blast from six to five in the past. In this way, twenty minutes can be saved for each blast. After such hard and skillful work, they can now complete the eight-hour task in only five hours. Therefore, since the implementation of the production increase and economy practice plan, they have been able to over-fulfill the drilling plan shift by shift.

    增产节约计划迅速落实  增产节约竞赛形成高潮
    鞍钢炉炉订计划班班订措施
    据新华社鞍山4日电　鞍山钢铁公司各厂矿职工系统地总结和推广先进操作经验，通过技术革新和技术革命猛攻当前生产关键，使增产节约计划迅速落实到每座炉子每个班组。各厂矿以增产钢为中心的增产节约竞赛高潮，正在迅速形成。
    这次增产节约运动一开始，鞍钢各厂矿职工就掀起了检查总结前七个月工作经验、讨论制订今后四个多月的增产指标和具体措施的热潮。在讨论计划的日子里，工人们情绪很高，许多人下班后连工作服都顾不得脱，就自动聚集在炉旁、轧钢机和电铲旁边，研究设备潜力和生产关键，寻找解决关键问题的措施。许多单位的增产关键课题，刚刚贴在攻关牌上，马上就被人抢了去；很多班组纷纷派代表到先进炉、先进班组去“取经”、下“战表”，展开对手赛。经过广泛、深入和细致的讨论，鞍钢今后四个月的生产计划，已经落实到每一座平炉和高炉、每一台电铲和轧钢机。每个班组和个人都订出了按班、按日实现计划的措施，并且迅速地展开了竞赛。
    许多厂矿、平炉和高炉分别总结和推广了一批行之有效的先进经验。职工们把这些先进经验看成是完成和超额完成今后四个月生产计划的可靠保证。第一炼钢厂九号平炉职工，上半年由于坚持开展四班之间的“接力赛”，使得四班团结一致，月月超额完成计划。这次他们在讨论计划时，又实行了“定人员、定部位”维护炉底的制度，进一步补充和丰富了四班“接力赛”的经验，使每炉钢的产量进一步提高，实现了“多装”、“快炼”双跃进。这个经验一出现，就吸引了全厂各个平炉的职工，立刻掀起一场学九号平炉、赶九号平炉、超九号平炉的竞赛热潮，几乎所有平炉都迅速推广了九号平炉的“定人员、定部位”维护炉体和四班“接力赛”的先进经验。
    各厂矿职工通过技术革新和技术革命，猛攻当前生产关键，为实现增产节约指标扫清道路。炼铁厂职工在战胜水灾、恢复生产之后，针对铁水罐凝盖周转不开的关键问题，大闹技术革新和技术革命。四号高炉甲班炉前组长刘殿生、丁班炉前副组长刘莫开两人，研究出不让渣子和沙子跑进铁水罐里去的办法，有效地攻克了铁水罐凝盖的关键。这一技术革新成果很快在全厂高炉上推广以后，就保证了高炉的正点出铁。东鞍山铁矿“猛虎”凿岩班在生产中，一方面抓紧放炮的三小时作好一切准备工作，尽可能缩短辅助时间；一方面改进炮眼分部位置，发挥每炮的威力，每遍炮由过去打六个眼减少到五个眼。这样，每放一遍炮就可节约二十分钟。经过这样苦干巧干，现在只用五个小时就可以完成八个小时的任务。因此，执行增产节约计划以来，他们已经作到了班班超额完成凿眼计划。
