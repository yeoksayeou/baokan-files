Several Experiences of Professional Performing Arts Groups Serving Agriculture
　　Wū Xīlíng

Since 1958, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, driven by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and guided by the Party's policy of literature and art serving proletarian politics, socialist construction, and workers, peasants, and soldiers, over three thousand professional artistic performing groups across the country have gone to the mountains, to the countryside, to the factories, and to the troops, delivering performances to the doorsteps, going deep among the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and launching large-scale performance activities. Through performance activities deep in the grassroots, professional artistic performing groups have conducted socialist and communist ideological education for the broad masses, greatly inspired the labor enthusiasm of the masses, promoted production, and enlivened the cultural and recreational life of the masses.

    Strengthening the Planned Nature of Rural Touring Performance Activities

Since the beginning of this year, most artistic performing groups in various regions have gone to the forefront of agriculture more than once; moreover, in order to adapt to the new situation on the agricultural production front and to better serve agricultural production, many artistic performing groups have paid attention to overcoming blindness and strengthening planning in arranging rural touring performance activities. The "four fixeds" method created by some theater troupes during touring performance activities in rural areas last year, which involved fixed routes, fixed points, fixed times, and fixed tasks, has been widely adopted by many artistic performing groups since the beginning of this year. This means that when a performing group arrives at a commune, it asks the commune Party committee to delineate a performance route including all production teams of the commune, fix several performance central points, stipulate the performance time at each central point, and determine the number of performances as well as propaganda, labor, and guidance tasks.

For artistic performing groups, the "four fixeds" method allows for smooth performance activities and greater effectiveness because the commune and production brigades have unified arrangements and the propaganda center is clear. For the commune, the Party committee takes the initiative in arranging the performance activities of artistic performing groups, knowing what to expect in advance. Thus, not only can it better arrange the work and rest life of commune members, but it can also use the opportunity of the masses gathering to watch performances to promote production work in the commune. The leaders of some commune Party committees in many regions first convene mass meetings before the performances to arrange production tasks, mobilize production, or carry out propaganda and education work on current affairs and policies. This method of combining watching performances, holding meetings, and listening to reports not only allows the masses to watch performances and receive education, but also promotes production work and saves a gathering time. Because of this, some places call it a method that satisfies the Party committee, the masses, and the theater troupe.

The benefits of adopting the "four fixeds" method are even more significant during the busy farming season; it not only prevents the phenomenon of performances affecting production labor, but also, if arranged properly, allows commune members to have the opportunity to watch performances even during the general busy farming season, better inspiring the enthusiasm of the masses for production labor.

          Performing While Laboring

All artistic performing groups have adhered to the practice of performing while laboring during their stay in rural areas. In the countryside, wherever one can see artistic groups carrying out performance and propaganda activities, one can see artistic performers participating in production labor. Since the beginning of this year, the idea that the development of the national economy must be based on agriculture has become increasingly deeply rooted in people's hearts; in addition to more actively using artistic weapons to serve agriculture, professional artistic performers have also become increasingly conscious of supporting agricultural production with the practical action of personally participating in physical labor. Especially during busy farming seasons such as spring plowing and sowing, summer harvesting and planting, or in the crash movements of agricultural drought resistance, many artistic performing groups have also devoted more time than usual to participating in production labor. In terms of activity arrangements, they generally disperse during the day in the fields and construction sites, working with the masses to rush harvest and planting, resist drought and disaster relief, or tamp earth and transport soil; at the same time, they go deep into the masses through labor, timely compile programs reflecting new people and new things in the local area, and carry out propaganda and mobilization work on the spot during the masses' labor intervals. In the evening, they gather together to perform for the masses or carry out guidance activities without affecting production.

In recent years, many artistic groups and artistic workers have been praised by local Party committees and the masses for their labor, and have even been named advanced labor units and production experts.

      Performing Wherever, Guiding Wherever

With the new situation of the great development of agricultural production, the demand for propaganda and mobilization work in the form of literature and art in rural areas has become increasingly widespread and urgent. This demand cannot be met by professional artistic performing groups alone and must rely on the widespread development of mass amateur activities to be solved. "Performing wherever, guiding wherever" is the universally consistent slogan of action for all professional artistic performing groups since the Great Leap Forward. This year, in the performance activities of going to the mountains and countryside to support agriculture, professional artistic performing groups in various regions have also actively carried out guidance work for mass amateur artistic activities, taking advantage of the masses' production gaps and spare time. The content of guidance is diverse and determined by the needs of the masses; the guidance methods are flexible and convenient and follow the production situation in the commune. Through guidance work, professional artistic knowledge is sent to the countryside, thereby improving the quality of commune amateur artistic activities, enlivening the cultural and recreational life of the masses, and strengthening field propaganda and mobilization activities.

In this year's guidance activities, new phenomena worthy of attention have also appeared. That is: after a period of guidance, some professional artistic workers and activists in commune amateur artistic activities are carrying out propaganda and mobilization activities side by side in the fields. Adopting this method can not only further consolidate teaching achievements and exchange activity experience with each other, but more importantly, it can encourage members of commune amateur literary and art organizations to engage in the work enthusiasm and confidence of performance and propaganda activities, so that artistic weapons can play a greater role in serving agriculture.

    Actively Carrying Out Mass Movements to Support Agriculture

With the widespread development of mass movements to support agriculture in all walks of life across the country, the activities of artistic performing groups going to the mountains and countryside to perform have also undergone new developments. This year, in addition to more actively and systematically arranging for performing groups to conduct regular performance activities in rural areas than in previous years, cultural leadership departments at all levels in various regions have also taken the method of vigorously carrying out mass movements to mobilize and organize a large number of artistic performing groups, dividing into areas and batches to go deep into the front line of agriculture to carry out performance and propaganda activities, according to the needs of different central tasks in various periods on the local agricultural front. In April this year, when the people's communes in the suburbs of Chengdu were making a big spring plowing movement, the various artistic performing groups belonging to the city went to the front line of spring plowing production in separate areas and batches to carry out consolation performances in order to vigorously support agriculture. For example, the professional artistic groups in Shandong Province and its various prefectures, cities, and counties, in order to powerfully support the mass movement of rural drought resistance, spring planting, and drought resistance irrigation of wheat, timely set off a wave of literary and artistic performance and propaganda activities serving drought resistance throughout the province.

This kind of performance and propaganda activities carried out in the form of movement is combined with actively participating in agricultural production labor, and the latter accounts for a large proportion. Especially in recent months, it has often taken participating in production assaults as the main content of the activity, while performances are carried out without occupying the production time of the masses or increasing the fatigue of the masses. Therefore, professional artistic performing groups going deep into the front line of agriculture are now not only a literary and artistic army, but also a production army. The thirteen artistic performing groups directly under Qinghai Province and Xining City have reclaimed more than 2,000 mu of wasteland in the upsurge of supporting agriculture since this year. The forty-five performers and staff of the Hengshan Flower Drum Opera Troupe in Hunan completed 5,500 work points in a month during the performance activities of supporting rice transplanting, and also accumulated more than 45,000 jin of fertilizer. Wherever they go, they also widely spread the technology of operating rice transplanters and other technologies learned at the recent agricultural technology innovation on-site conference. In this way, they are not only actors, but also laborers and promoters of new agricultural technologies.

As mentioned earlier, in order to cooperate with the central assault tasks on the agricultural front, carrying out a mass movement of professional artistic performing groups supporting agriculture in a certain period, its advantages are that it has a large momentum, a clear purpose (serving production and directly participating in production), diverse content and forms, and prominent propaganda center, so it has a far-reaching impact, a significant effect, and can play a timely and powerful role in promoting production. The promotion working group jointly formed by twelve professional groups in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, timely compiled and performed new people and new things in the local area to promote production wherever they went. When the second performance team of the group performed in a production brigade, they widely spread the advanced deeds of Chen A'mao, the deputy captain of the production team and a rice transplanting expert, and the advanced experience of transplanting rice seedlings in the form of performing arts. After hearing this, the commune members said, "If the captain can transplant rice seedlings, we can also transplant them." On the spot, it set off a competition upsurge for everyone to learn and catch up with Chen A'mao.

        Double Harvest of Ideology and Art

Through a series of performances, propaganda, guidance, and labor activities in going to the mountains and countryside to support agriculture, professional artistic performing groups have not only strengthened the socialist ideological position and promoted agricultural production in the countryside, but also brought themselves a double harvest of ideology and art. Because of the close contact with the masses in their work and the implementation of the principle of combining professionalism with amateurism, artistic workers have found the source of creation, enriched the repertoire of performances, and improved the quality of artistic performance. Therefore, they have a deeper understanding and understanding of Chairman Mao's policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and their ideological feelings have gradually changed. Professional artistic performers have seen with their own eyes the incomparable superiority of the people's communes, the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants in the struggle for production, and the bright prospects for rural development in the countryside. Therefore, they have a further understanding of the Party's great call of "all walks of life supporting agriculture," and the revolutionary enthusiasm for supporting agriculture has become more and more sufficient.

　　专业表演艺术团体为农业服务的几点经验
　　邬析零
      1958年以来，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在工农业生产大跃进形势的推动和党的文艺为无产阶级政治、为社会主义建设、为工农兵服务的方针指导下，全国三千多专业艺术表演团体纷纷上山、下乡、下厂、下部队，送戏上门，深入工农兵群众，展开了声势浩大的演出活动。专业艺术表演团体通过深入基层的演出活动，对广大群众进行了社会主义、共产主义思想教育，大大地鼓舞了群众的劳动热情，推动了生产，也活跃了群众的文娱生活。
    加强农村巡回演出活动的计划性
    今年以来，各地大部分艺术表演团体已经不止一次地深入到农业最前线；而且，为了适应当前农业生产战线上的新形势，为了更好地为农业生产服务，许多艺术表演团体在安排农村巡回演出活动的工作上，都注意到了克服盲目性，加强计划性。去年由某些剧团在农村进行巡回演出活动中所创造的定线、定点、定时、定任务的四定办法，今年以来已为许多艺术表演团体普遍采用。这就是：表演团体一到公社，就请公社党委划定一条包括公社各生产队的演出路线，固定若干个演出中心点，规定在每个中心点的演出时间，确定演出场数以及宣传、劳动和辅导任务。
    四定办法对艺术表演团体来说，由于公社和生产大队有了统一布置，宣传中心又明确，因此，演出活动可以顺利进行，收效也更大。对公社来说，由于党委在安排艺术表演团体的演出活动上掌握了主动权，事先心里有数，因此不但可以借此更为妥善地安排社员群众的劳逸生活，而且还能利用群众集合看戏的机会来推动社里的生产工作。有不少地区的公社党委领导，在演出开始前先召开群众大会，布置生产任务、进行生产动员或进行时事政策等方面的宣传教育工作。这种看戏、开会、听报告结合起来的办法，既使群众看了戏、受到了教育，又推动了生产工作，而且还节省了一次集合时间。因为这样，有些地方把它称为党委、群众、剧团三满意的办法。
    在农忙季节进行演出活动时，采用四定办法的好处更为显著；不但可以防止因演出而影响生产劳动的现象，而且，如果安排得法，还可以让社员即使在一般的农忙时候也能有看戏的机会，更好地鼓舞群众的生产劳动热情。
          边演出　边劳动
    所有艺术表演团体在深入农村期间，都坚持了边演出、边劳动的做法。在农村里，凡是能看到艺术团体进行演出宣传活动的地方，就能看到艺术表演工作者在那里参加生产劳动。今年以来，发展国民经济必须以农业为基础的思想日益深入人心；专业艺术表演工作者除了更加积极地以艺术武器来为农业服务外，也越来越有意识地以亲身参加体力劳动的实际行动来支援农业生产。特别是在春耕春播、夏收夏种等农忙时节，或者在农业抗旱的突击运动中，许多艺术表演团体还抽出了比往常更多的时间参加生产劳动。在活动安排方面，一般的是白天分散在田间、工地，一面和群众共同抢收抢种、抗旱灭灾或打夯运土等等；一面通过劳动深入群众，及时编排反映当地新人新事的节目，并利用群众劳动间歇时间当场开展宣传鼓动工作。一到晚上，就集合起来，在不影响生产的情况下为群众演出或开展辅导活动。
    这几年来，有不少艺术团体和艺术工作者在劳动中受到了当地党委和群众的表扬，甚至被评为劳动先进单位和生产能手。
      演出到哪里　辅导到哪里
    随着农业生产大发展的新形势，在农村里对以文艺形式进行宣传鼓动工作的需求也日益普遍而迫切。这种需求，如果单靠专业艺术表演团体是远远不能满足的，必须依靠广泛开展群众业余活动才能得到解决。“演出到哪里，辅导到哪里”，这是大跃进以来各专业艺术表演团体普遍一致的行动口号。今年各地专业艺术表演团体在上山、下乡支援农业的演出活动中，也利用群众生产空隙和业余时间积极地开展了群众业余艺术活动的辅导工作。辅导内容多种多样，随群众需要而定；辅导方式灵活简便，随社里生产情况而行。通过辅导工作，把专业艺术知识送到了农村，从而提高了公社业余艺术活动的质量，活跃了群众的文娱生活，也加强了田间的宣传鼓动活动。
    在今年的辅导活动中，也出现了值得注意的新现象。这就是：经过一定时期辅导以后，有些专业艺术工作者和公社业余艺术活动的积极分子在田间、地头并肩开展宣传鼓动活动。采用这一种办法，不仅可以进一步巩固教学成绩，相互交流活动经验，更重要的是，借此可以鼓舞公社业余文艺组织成员从事演出宣传活动的工作热情和信心，使艺术武器在为农业服务中发挥出更大的作用。
    积极开展支援农业的群众运动
    随着全国各行各业支援农业的群众运动的广泛开展，艺术表演团体的上山、下乡演出活动也有了新的发展。今年各地各级文化领导部门，除了比往年更积极更有计划地安排了表演团体到农村进行经常的演出活动外，许多地区还根据当地农业战线上各个时期不同中心任务的需要，采取大搞群众运动的办法，动员和组织了大批艺术表演团体，分片分批地深入到农业第一线开展演出宣传活动。今年4月间，成都市郊区各人民公社正在大闹春耕运动的时候，市属的各个艺术表演团体为大力支援农业，分片分批地奔赴春耕生产第一线进行慰问演出。又如山东省和该省各专区、市、县的专业艺术团体，为了有力地支援农村抗旱春播、抗旱浇麦的群众运动，在全省范围内及时地掀起了文艺演出宣传活动为抗旱服务的热潮。
    这种以运动方式大搞演出宣传活动，是与积极参加农业生产劳动结合进行的，而且后者占比重很大。特别是近几个月来，还常常以参加生产突击为活动的主要内容，而演出则是在不占用群众生产时间、不增加群众疲劳的情况下进行的。因此，深入到农业第一线的专业艺术表演团体，这时候已不只是一支文艺大军，也是一支生产大军。青海省和西宁市直属的十三个艺术表演团体，今年以来在支援农业的热潮中已开出荒地二千多亩。湖南衡山花鼓戏剧团的四十五名演职员，在支援插秧的演出活动中，一个月里完成了五千五百个劳动工分，另外还积肥四万五千多斤。他们每到一处，还将新近在农业技术革新现场会议上学到的操作插秧机等技术广为传播。这样，他们就既是演员，是劳动者，又是农业新技术的推广员。
    如前面所说的，为配合农业战线上的中心突击任务，在一定时期内开展一个专业艺术表演团体支援农业的群众运动，它的好处是声势浩大、目的明确（既为生产服务，又直接参加生产）、内容形式多样、宣传中心突出，因而影响深远，效果显著，对生产能起及时而有力的推动作用。由浙江省杭州市的十二个专业团体联合组成的促进文工团，他们每到一个地方，就及时编演当地的新人新事推动生产。该团第二演出队在一个生产大队演出时，把生产队副队长兼插秧能手陈阿毛的先进事迹和插补秧的先进经验，用表演艺术形式广泛传播。社员们听了之后都说：“队长能插补秧，我们也能插。”当场就掀起人人学赶陈阿毛的竞赛热潮。
        思想与艺术双丰收
    通过上山、下乡支援农业一系列的演出、宣传、辅导和劳动等活动，专业艺术表演团体不仅在农村中加强了社会主义思想阵地，推动了农业生产，而且也为自己带来了思想与艺术双丰收。由于在工作中密切联系了群众，贯彻了专业与业余相结合的原则，艺术工作者找到了创作的源泉，丰富了上演节目，提高了艺术表演质量，因而对毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务的方针有了更深刻的体会和理解，思想感情也逐渐起了变化。专业艺术表演工作者在农村里亲眼看到了人民公社的无比优越性，看到了广大农民群众在生产斗争中的冲天干劲，和农村发展的光明前景，因此，对党的
  “各行各业支援农业”的伟大号召有了进一步的认识，支援农业的革命劲头也就越鼓越足了。
