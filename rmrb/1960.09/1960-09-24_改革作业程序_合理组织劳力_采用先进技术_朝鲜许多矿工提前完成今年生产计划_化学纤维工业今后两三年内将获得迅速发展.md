Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang:

    Reform Operating Procedures, Rationally Organize Labor, Adopt Advanced Technology
    Many Korean Miners Fulfill This Year's Production Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Chemical Fiber Industry Will Achieve Rapid Development in the Next Two to Three Years
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: Miners in northern Korea are creating even greater labor achievements to accelerate the country's socialist construction.
    The Female Bok-gyu Work Team of the No. 5 Coal Mining Area, Section Three, of the Awooji Coal Mine, greatly improved coal mining efficiency by reforming operating procedures, rationally organizing labor, and adopting chain mining machines and continuous blasting methods. In the first ten days of September, this work team produced 4,170 tons of coal, equivalent to the output of twenty days in August. They are currently striving to produce 15,000 tons of coal this month.
    Miners in northern Korea are constantly learning from advanced experiences, resulting in daily improvements in production performance. The An Chang-seon Work Team of the Dongfang Mine in Jagang Province improved their tunneling speed from 20 meters per month to 100 meters per month by preparing their work in advance and selecting drilling positions based on the rock conditions, increasing the number of blasts per shift from one to three on one working face. The Zhang Hao-nan Work Team of this mine creatively learned from the advanced experience of the An Chang-seon Work Team, increasing drilling speed by 30% compared to before and completing 150% of the daily plan. After the leading cadres of the Dongfang Mine widely promoted these advanced experiences, the amount of tunneling gradually increased. Taking the average speed as an example, it was 266 meters in January, rising to 646 meters in July and 680 meters in August.
    Many miners have already fulfilled this year's annual production plan ahead of schedule, but they are not satisfied with their current achievements and are striving to complete new production plans. The Kim Sang-bo Mining Work Team of the Hwaphong Mine completed its annual plan as early as July 20. In order to overfulfill the annual mining plan by 170% by the end of the year, they have launched a vigorous labor competition.
    On the 17th, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a decree awarding the title of "Meritorious Miner of the Republic" and the First Class National Flag Order to twenty outstanding miners, including Kang Seon-il, Kang Soo-won, and Kim Kwang-ho.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: Korea is vigorously developing its chemical fiber industry to increase the annual output of various textiles to 300 million meters in the next two to three years.
    In the past fifteen years, the textile industry in northern Korea has developed rapidly. Last year, 150 million meters of textiles were produced, reaching 115 times that of 1944.
    However, due to the limitations of climate and geographical conditions in northern Korea, relying solely on cotton cultivation cannot fully meet the growing needs of the people for clothing. Therefore, the Korean Workers' Party has decided to vigorously develop the chemical fiber industry, using the abundant timber, reeds, calcium carbide and other raw materials in northern Korea to produce chemical fibers.
    In Chongjin, a rayon fiber plant with an annual output of 20,000 tons of rayon and rayon staple fiber, using wood pulp as raw material, has been restored and expanded.
    The Sinuiju Integrated Textile Factory, currently under construction, uses reeds and corn stalks as raw materials. The scale of this factory is equivalent to the Pyongyang Textile Factory, Kilju Pulp Mill, and Chongjin Rayon Fiber Plant combined. It can produce 60 million meters of cloth per year.
    Korea is also building a vinylon chemical fiber plant in the Hungnam area. Northern Korea has abundant calcium carbide resources, so it is very economical to develop the vinylon chemical fiber industry, which uses calcium carbide for manufacturing. This chemical fiber can be woven into high-grade textiles that are strong and beautiful. The builders of this factory are determined to complete the first phase of the project before the "May 1st" International Labor Day next year, and to complete the entire project by the end of next year. The total construction area of this factory is 56,000 square meters. After completion, it can produce 20,000 tons of vinylon annually, which can be woven into 140 million meters of textiles.
    Recently, Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of Korea, inspected the construction site of this factory, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the construction workers, who are launching a labor competition to strive to complete the factory ahead of schedule.

### 改革作业程序　合理组织劳力　采用先进技术  朝鲜许多矿工提前完成今年生产计划  化学纤维工业今后两三年内将获得迅速发展

    改革作业程序　合理组织劳力　采用先进技术
    朝鲜许多矿工提前完成今年生产计划
    化学纤维工业今后两三年内将获得迅速发展
    据新华社平壤讯　朝鲜北部的矿工们正在创造更大的劳动成果，来加速祖国的社会主义建设。
    阿吾地煤矿龙岩井三区五号采煤场的女福奎作业班，由于改革作业程序、合理地组织劳动力以及采用链式开采机和连续爆破法，大大提高了采煤效率。这个作业班在9月份头十天生产了四千一百七十吨煤，等于8月份二十天的产量。目前他们正在努力争取在本月生产一万五千吨煤。
    朝鲜北部的矿工们不断学习先进经验，使生产成绩日日刷新。慈江道东方矿山安昌善作业班由于事先作好作业准备，又根据岩石的状况选择打眼位置，在一个掌子面由从前一班一次爆破提高到三次爆破，一个月的掘进速度由二十米提高到了一百米。这个矿山的张浩男作业班创造性地学习安昌善作业班的先进经验，使打眼速度比以前提高了30％，每天完成计划的150％。东方矿山的领导干部把这些先进经验普遍推广以后，掘进量步步上升。拿平均速度来看，1月份是二百六十六米，7月份提高到六百四十六米，8月份是六百八十米。
    许多矿工已经提前完成了今年全年生产计划，但是他们并不满足于现有的成绩，正纷纷为完成新的生产计划而奋斗。和丰矿山金相宝采矿作业班早在7月20日就完成了今年的全年计划；为了在年底前超额完成全年采矿计划的170％，他们又展开了热火朝天的劳动竞赛。
    17日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会发布政令，授予优秀矿工姜善日、姜洙元、金光浩等二十人以共和国“功勋矿工”称号和一级国旗勋章。
    据新华社平壤讯　朝鲜正在大力发展化学纤维工业，以便在二、三年内将各种纺织品的年产量增加到三亿米。
    十五年来，朝鲜北部的纺织工业有了迅速的发展。去年生产了一亿五千万米纺织品，达到1944年的一百一十五倍。
    但是由于朝鲜北部受到气候和地理条件的限制，仅靠种植棉花不能充分满足日益增长的人民穿衣的需要，因此，朝鲜劳动党决定大力发展化学纤维工业，利用朝鲜北部十分丰富的木材、芦苇、电石等原料生产化学纤维。
    在清津，已经恢复和扩建起来一座以木材纸浆作原料、年产二万吨人造丝和人造棉的人造纤维厂。
    正在兴建中的新义州综合纺织工厂是以芦苇和玉米秸为原料的。这个工厂的规模等于平壤纺织工厂、吉州纸浆厂和清津人造纤维厂等三个工厂那样大，一年能生产六千万米布匹。
    朝鲜还在兴南地区兴建一座维尼龙化学纤维厂。朝鲜北部的电石资源很丰富，因此，发展用电石制造的维尼龙化学纤维工业是很经济的。这种化学纤维可以织成高级纺织品，又牢固又美观。这个工厂的建设者们决心要在明年“五一”国际劳动节以前完成第一阶段工程，到明年年底全部竣工。这个工厂的总建筑面积有五万六千平方米，全部建成后每年能生产二万吨维尼龙，织成一亿四千万米纺织品。
    最近，朝鲜内阁首相金日成视察了这个工厂的建设工地，大大地鼓舞了建筑工人的热情，他们正展开劳动竞赛，为提前建成这个工厂而努力。
