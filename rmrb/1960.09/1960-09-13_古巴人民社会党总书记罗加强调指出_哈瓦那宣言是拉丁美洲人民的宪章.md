Xinhua News Agency, Havana, September 11th: Cuban People's Socialist Party General Secretary Blas Roca stated today in a television program of the "People's University Lecture" that the Havana Declaration adopted by the Cuban People's National Assembly has world-historical significance.

He emphasized that, in response to the "Declaration of San José" that subjugates Latin American countries to the United States, the Havana Declaration puts forward a program for Latin American people to strive for freedom, land reform, and the development of trade with all countries in the world. The Latin American people regard the Havana Declaration as their own charter. When the Latin American people begin to implement this program, it will generate extremely important world significance.

In his speech entitled "Social System and Freedom," Roca theoretically refuted the slander spread by the United States that Cuba has no freedom. He pointed out that convening the foreign ministers' meeting of the Organization of American States is an effort by imperialism to create conditions for slandering the Cuban revolution and preparing to crush the Cuban revolution. However, because the Latin American people have already mobilized, the imperialists were unable to obtain everything they hoped for at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, San José, September 6th: The Havana Declaration adopted by the Cuban People's National Assembly on September 2nd has aroused great sympathy from all sectors of the people in Costa Rica.

A mass rally was held last night in the workers' residential center in San José, the capital of Costa Rica. Manuel Mora, General Secretary of the People's Vanguard Party, expressed his full support for the Havana Declaration in his speech at the meeting.

The Costa Rican Women's League decided today to send a telegram to Cuban women in support of the Havana Declaration.

    古巴人民社会党总书记罗加强调指出
    哈瓦那宣言是拉丁美洲人民的宪章
    新华社哈瓦那11日电　古巴人民社会党总书记布拉斯·罗加今天在“人民大学讲座”的电视节目中说，古巴人民全国大会通过的哈瓦那宣言具有世界范围的历史意义。
    他强调指出，针对使拉丁美洲国家屈从于美国的“圣约瑟宣言”，哈瓦那宣言提出了拉丁美洲各国人民争取自由、土地改革和同世界各国发展贸易的纲领。拉丁美洲各国人民把哈瓦那宣言看成是他们自己的宪章。当拉丁美洲各国人民开始实现这个纲领的时候，它将产生极其重要的世界意义。
    罗加在这篇题为“社会制度和自由”的演说中，从理论上驳斥了美国散布的所谓古巴没有自由的诽谤。他指出，召开美洲国家组织成员国外长会议，是帝国主义为诽谤古巴革命和准备击溃古巴革命的条件所作的努力。但是，由于拉丁美洲各国人民已经动员起来，帝国主义者在会上没有能够获得他们所希望的全部东西。
    据新华社圣约瑟6日电　古巴人民全国大会2日通过的哈瓦那宣言激起了哥斯达黎加各阶层人民的巨大同情。
    在哥斯达黎加首都圣约瑟的工人居住中心，昨晚举行了群众集会。人民先锋党总书记曼努埃尔·莫拉在会上的发言中表示完全支持哈瓦那宣言。
    哥斯达黎加妇女联盟今天决定致电古巴妇女，支持哈瓦那宣言。
