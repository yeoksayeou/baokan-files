Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, August 31st: According to a press release issued by the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party and published in today's and yesterday's Jakarta "People's Daily," the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party has sent letters to President and Supreme War Administrator Sukarno, relevant departments of the central government, the Cooperation Parliament, and the war administrators of the South Kalimantan, South Sumatra, Jambi, and South and Southeast Sulawesi military regions, raising the issue of the Indonesian Communist Party being banned from activities in the aforementioned military regions by the three war administrators. A delegation from the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, led by Indonesian Communist Party Vice Chairman Lukman, also visited First Minister Djuanda regarding this matter.

According to the announcement, the Indonesian Communist Party raised political and legal arguments in the letter, demanding the cancellation of the decisions made by the three war administrators regarding the ban on Indonesian Communist Party activities. The Central Committee of the Communist Party believes that Presidential Decision No. 7 and Decree No. 23 of 1959 regarding the state of emergency do not authorize local war administrators to take such measures.

According to the announcement, the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party believes that the reasons given by the war administrators of South Sumatra and Jambi for banning Indonesian Communist Party activities are not in accordance with the facts. The press release pointed out that the Indonesian Communist Party has consistently provided obvious assistance to the war administrator of the military region in the process of restoring national security. The press release also pointed out that the decision of the war administrator of South and Southeast Sulawesi is legally untenable.

Jakarta "People's Daily" reported that the Third National Congress of the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union Federation telegraphed the war administrator of South Kalimantan, protesting against his decision to ban the union's activities in South Kalimantan and demanding the cancellation of his decision.

The All-Indonesia Central Trade Union Federation also telegraphed the President, requesting him to resolve the issue.

The People's Youth League also telegraphed the President, requesting him to take measures to revoke the decisions of the war administrators of South Sumatra and Jambi regarding the ban on the People's Youth League's activities.

    印度尼西亚共产党函苏加诺并访问朱安达
    指出禁止共产党活动毫无理由
    一些地区的工会和人民青年团竟被禁止活动
    新华社雅加达31日电　据印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会书记处发表并刊载在今天和昨天的雅加达“人民日报”上的新闻公报说，印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会已致函总统兼最高战时掌权者苏加诺、中央政府有关部门、合作国会和南加里曼丹、南苏门答腊、占碑及南和东南苏拉威西军区的战时掌权者，向他们提出了印度尼西亚共产党被上述三个战时掌权者禁止在上述各军区活动的问题。由印度尼西亚共产党副主席鲁克曼率领的印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会代表团还就这件事访问了第一部长朱安达。
    据宣布，印度尼西亚共产党在信中提出了政治和法律的论据，要求取消这三个战时掌权者所作出的关于禁止印度尼西亚共产党活动的决定。共产党中央委员会认为，总统第七号决定和1959年关于紧急状态的第二十三号法令都未授权地方战时掌权者采取这种措施。
    据宣布，印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会认为，南苏门答腊和占碑战时掌权者对于禁止印度尼西亚共产党活动的理由是不符合事实的。新闻公报指出，印度尼西亚共产党在恢复国家安全的过程中不断给该军区的战时掌权者以显而易见的帮助。新闻公报还指出，南和东南苏拉威西战时掌权者的决定在法律上是站不住脚的。
    雅加达“人民日报”报道，全印度尼西亚中央职工会第三次全国代表大会致电南加里曼丹战时掌权者，对他作出的禁止这个职工会在南加里曼丹活动的决定提出抗议，并要求取消他的决定。
    全印度尼西亚中央职工会还致电总统要求解决这个问题。
    人民青年团也致电总统，要求他采取措施，撤销南苏门答腊和占碑战时掌权者关于禁止人民青年团活动的决定。
