    They have helped Xingdian Commune manufacture a complete set of implements suitable for garden cultivation, including 23 new tools for various purposes from plowing, loosening soil, and building ridges to sowing, weeding, and harvesting. These tools are characterized by simple structure, easy to use and light, saving materials, low cost, and high efficiency, and are relatively easy for commune-run industries to manufacture.
    (Our dispatch from Tianjin, September 4) The Tianjin Agricultural Machinery Procurement and Supply Station conscientiously implements the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods. While supplying tractors, harvesters and other agricultural machinery to rural areas, it actively synthesizes and compares the new information on farm tool reforms collected from various places, selects "complete sets" with high work efficiency, low cost, and ease of manufacture, compiles and prints agricultural machinery reform materials for various places to reference, and vigorously runs farm tool innovation "experimental fields" in rural people's communes to support agricultural technical transformation.
    In response to the fact that garden production occupies a large amount of labor, the station first established a garden machinery "experimental field" in the Xingdian People's Commune in the suburbs of Tianjin. They adopted methods such as supplying technical materials and equipment, and helping to solve problems in production, to assist the commune-run industry in manufacturing a set of 23 machines for garden production, including plowing, loosening soil, building ridges, sowing, weeding, and harvesting. These machines all have the characteristics of simple structure, easy to use and light, saving materials, low cost, and high efficiency, which are convenient for commune-run industries in various places to manufacture and promote. For example, the garden harrow used for turning and loosening the soil can be pulled by two people, and can harrow 30 mu of garden land a day, which is more than 30 times more efficient than manual labor with a four-pronged rake. The four-row seeder used for sowing Chinese cabbage, tomatoes, eggplants and other vegetables connects the four processes of digging ditches, sowing seeds, covering soil, and compacting at one time, which is 14 to 15 times more efficient than manual labor. The carrot seeder not only completes the three processes of sowing seeds, covering soil, and leveling at one time, but also solves the problem that carrot seeds cannot be sown due to their light weight and fluffiness, or cannot be sown well due to poor technology. Among these machines, there are also close-planting seeders and universal seedling transplanters suitable for close-planting of vegetables. These earth-made machines used for garden production have been widely promoted in the Xingdian People's Commune, and have shown great advantages in the recent rush to plant autumn vegetables. This year, the planting area of Chinese cabbage in Yixingbu Management Area has expanded from more than 600 mu last year to more than 1,600 mu. According to the planting situation in previous years, more than 1,500 laborers would be needed, and it would take a month to complete the planting. Due to the use of new machines, only more than 100 people took 20 days to complete the planting. At the same time, the seeds are evenly spread, the row spacing is appropriate, the sowing quality is high, and one-third of the seeds are saved.
    The task of this procurement and supply station is to be responsible for supplying tractors, diesel engines and other agricultural machinery produced by the Tianjin agricultural machinery industry to rural areas according to the national plan. Since the beginning of this year, all employees have established the idea of ​​"being proud to support agriculture." In order to better support agriculture, they often go deep into rural areas to investigate the needs of the people's communes for agricultural machinery. They saw that rural areas need a large number of agricultural machinery in order to accelerate agricultural technical transformation, but the modern agricultural machinery currently supplied to rural areas in various places cannot meet the needs for a while. The party and government leaders of the station took the initiative to specially transfer seven cadres in March to set up an office to support agricultural technical transformation, responsible for helping the people's communes to vigorously carry out farm tool reform and research and manufacture semi-mechanized machinery. After the establishment of the office to support agricultural technical transformation, on the one hand, people were sent to many places to learn and collect the semi-mechanized agricultural machinery manufactured locally, and on the other hand, they gave play to the advantages of the commercial department's wide contact surface, and actively contacted more than 100 agricultural machinery production and research departments in Jilin, Liaoning, Gansu and other places. Established an exchange relationship for information on agricultural machinery innovation, and collected more than 2,100 technical materials on improved agricultural tools in just over a month. They adopted the method of collecting, researching, trial-producing, and appraising at the same time, linking up with rural people's communes, establishing machinery innovation "experimental fields," and vigorously carrying out farm tool reform experiments. According to the three different types of dry land, paddy fields, and gardens in agricultural production, they established three "experimental fields" in Xingdian People's Commune, Weinan People's Commune in the suburbs of Tianjin, and Baodian Commune in Ningjin County. In these "experimental fields," they assisted the commune industry to "match into dragons" the agricultural machinery and innovation results collected from various places, and then promoted them. At present, in addition to helping Xingdian People's Commune to realize semi-mechanization of garden production, they have also helped Baodian Commune to manufacture a three-purpose tractor. This tractor can not only pull agricultural implements and deeply cultivate the land, but also be used as power machinery, so that one machine can be used for multiple purposes. They also assisted Weinan Commune in manufacturing a paddy field harrowing machine, which can harrow 100 mu of land a day, which can replace 30 people and 20 livestock. This paddy field harrowing machine is matched with rice transplanters, rice rakes, and rice harvesters, which can basically realize semi-mechanization of rice field production. (Attached picture)

    广泛收集技术资料　大办新农具“试验田”
    天津农业机械采购供应站帮助公社改革农具配套成龙
    他们已帮助兴淀公社制造出一整套适用园田耕作的机具，包括从耕地、松土、筑畦到播种、除草、收割等各种新工具共二十三种。这些工具都具有构造简单、使用轻便、用料省、成本低、效率高的特点，社办工业也比较容易制造。
    本报天津4日电　天津农业机械采购供应站认真贯彻土洋并举的方针，在供应各地农村拖拉机、收割机等农业机械的同时，主动把从各地收集来的农具改革的新资料，加以综合比较，选择其中工效高、成本低、易于制造的“配套成龙”，编印成农业机具改革资料，供给各地参考，并在农村人民公社大办农具革新“试验田”，支援农业技术改造。
    这个站针对园田生产占用劳动力多的情况，首先在天津市郊区兴淀人民公社建立了园田机具“试验田”。他们采取供应技术资料、器材和帮助解决生产中的问题等办法，协助这个公社的社办工业制造出一套从耕地、松土、筑畦垠到播种、除草、收割等用于园田生产的机具共二十三种。这些机具都具有构造简单、使用轻便、用料省、成本低、效率高的特点，便于各地社办工业制造推广。像用于翻地松土的园田耙，由两个人牵引，一天可耙园田三十亩，比人工用四齿耙刨效率高三十多倍。播种大白菜、西红柿、茄子等蔬菜用的四行播种器，把挑沟、撒种、盖土、踩实四道工序连接起来一次完成，比用人工效率高十四、五倍。胡萝卜播种器不仅把撒种、盖土、压平三道工序一次完成，而且解决了胡萝卜种籽因体轻有毛、有风不能撒或技术不好不能撒的问题。这些机具中还有适于蔬菜密植播种的密植播种器和万能补苗器等。这些用于园田生产的土机械已在兴淀人民公社普遍推广，并且在最近抢种秋菜中显示出了很大的优越性。宜兴埠管理区今年大白菜播种面积由去年的六百多亩扩大到一千六百多亩，如按往年的种植情况，需要一千五百多名劳动力，播种一个月才能完成；由于使用了新机具，仅用了一百多人、二十天的时间就完成了。同时，撒种均匀，行距适当，播种质量高，还节约了三分之一的种籽。
    这个采购供应站的任务，是根据国家计划，负责把天津市农业机械工业生产的拖拉机、柴油机等供应给各地农村。今年以来，全体职工树立了“以支援农业为荣”的思想，为了更好地支援农业，他们经常深入农村，调查人民公社对农业机具的需要情况。他们看到农村为了加速农业技术改造，需要大量的农业机械，而目前供应各地农村的现代化农业机械一时还不能满足需要，这个站的党政领导便主动在3月间专门抽调七名干部，成立了支援农业技术改造办公室，负责帮助人民公社大搞农具改革，研究制造半机械化的机具。支援农业技术改造办公室成立以后，一方面派人到许多地方学习和收集当地制造的半机械化农业机具，一方面发挥商业部门联系面广的长处，主动和吉林、辽宁、甘肃等地的一百多个农业机械生产和研究部门联系，建立了有关农业机具革新资料的交换关系，在一个多月里就搜集到二千一百多种改良农具的技术资料。他们采取了边搜集、边研究、边试制、边鉴定的办法，同农村人民公社挂钩，建立机具革新“试验田”，大搞农具改革试验。他们根据农业生产当中旱田、水田、园田三种不同的类型，分别在天津市郊区兴淀人民公社、卫南人民公社和宁津县的保店公社建立了三处“试验田”。在这些“试验田”里，他们协助公社工业把搜集到的各地农业机具和革新成果“配套成龙”，然后推广。目前，他们除帮助兴淀人民公社园田生产实现了半机械化以外，还帮助保店公社制成一种三用拖拉机。这种拖拉机，既能牵引农具，深耕土地，又能作为动力机械使用，作到一机多用。他们还协助卫南公社制成一架水田耙地机，每天可耙地一百亩，能代替三十个人力和二十头牲畜。这架水田耙地机与插秧机、挠秧器、稻谷收割机配套，可使稻田生产基本实现半机械化。（附图片）
