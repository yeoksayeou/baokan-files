Joint Statement of the All-China Youth Federation and the Japanese General Council of Trade Unions Youth and Women's Delegation

At the invitation of the All-China Youth Federation, the Japanese General Council of Trade Unions Youth and Women's Delegation visited the People's Republic of China in August 1960. During the visit, they held cordial and friendly talks with the All-China Youth Federation and issued the following joint statement:

Since the visit of the Japanese Youth and Women's Delegation to China in May 1959 and the signing of a joint statement with the All-China Youth Federation, the friendship between the youth and women of the two countries and the cause of opposing imperialism and defending peace have made great progress. The struggle to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in Japan has achieved a major victory. This struggle is a struggle to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary cabinet, which attempted to revive Japanese militarism and submit to the United States, and it is also a struggle to prevent U.S. imperialism from intensifying its military aggression system and to strive for Japan's independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality. In the past year or more of struggle, the youth and women of the two countries have supported each other, strengthened their unity, and successfully thwarted the conspiracies of the common enemy—U.S. imperialism.

Both sides believe that the national democratic independence movements against imperialism and colonialism headed by the United States, which have emerged in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other regions, are unprecedentedly surging. These broad mass struggles support and encourage each other, develop a powerful force to defend Asian and world peace, and give imperialism a heavy blow. However, U.S. imperialism is still occupying Okinawa Island and the Ogasawara Islands, which belong to Japanese territory, and is occupying Taiwan, which belongs to Chinese territory. It is actively carrying out arms expansion and war preparations, setting up military bases, and continuing to strengthen its aggression system. Both sides believe that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of China and Japan, and also the common enemy of peace-loving people in Asia and the world. The youth and women of the two countries must continue to strengthen their unity, support each other, and wage a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism.

The Japanese General Council of Trade Unions Youth and Women's Delegation affirms that Taiwan is forever an inalienable part of Chinese territory, opposes the aggressive conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and all reactionary forces to create "two Chinas," and firmly supports the Chinese people's struggle to safeguard their territorial sovereignty and liberate Taiwan. In order to promote friendly exchanges between the youth and women of China and Japan and restore diplomatic relations between China and Japan, they will fight against reactionary forces that adopt a hostile policy towards China and attempt to obstruct the friendship between the people and youth of the two countries. The All-China Youth Federation stated that Chinese youth resolutely support the Japanese people and youth in their struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, against U.S. military bases, and for the recovery of Okinawa; and resolutely support the Japanese youth and women in their struggle to realize Japan's independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality.

In order to oppose imperialism, defend peace, and strive for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, both sides have reached complete agreement on the following points:

1.  Uphold the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference;
2.  Persist in carrying out the struggle for comprehensive disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and the abolition of all foreign military bases;
3.  Support Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal for Asian and Pacific countries to sign a mutual non-aggression peace treaty and make this region a nuclear-weapon-free zone;
4.  Support the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism, and for the attainment and defense of national independence.

The Japanese General Council of Trade Unions Youth and Women's Delegation stated that Japanese youth and women are continuing to work to abolish the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism, to oppose reactionary education that attempts to revive Japanese militarism, and to oppose the forced implementation of "enterprise rationalization" that infringes upon the lives and rights of workers, and to oppose reactionary bills that suppress peaceful democratic movements, further strengthen unity, actively carry out struggles, and stand at the forefront of the struggle.

Both sides affirmed that in the common struggle against imperialism and for the defense of peace, the youth and women of China and Japan will continue to respect and support each other, and the understanding, friendship, and unity between the two organizations will be further deepened and developed through mutual visits and frequent exchanges of activity documents and materials.

    中华全国青年联合会同日本总评青年与妇女代表团的共同声明
    日本总评青年与妇女代表团应中华全国青年联合会的邀请，于1960年8月来中华人民共和国访问。在访问期间同中华全国青年联合会进行了亲切友好的会谈，并发表共同声明如下：
    自1959年5月日本青年与妇女访华代表团访问中华人民共和国，同中华全国青年联合会签订共同声明以来，两国青年与妇女的友谊和反对帝国主义、保卫和平的事业有了很大进展。在日本开展的废除日美“安全条约”的斗争取得了重大的胜利。这一斗争，是打倒企图复活日本军国主义和屈从美国的岸信介反动内阁的斗争，同时也是阻止美帝国主义加紧军事侵略体系和争取日本的独立、民主、和平、中立的斗争。在这一年多的斗争中，两国青年与妇女相互支持，加强团结，成功地挫败了共同敌人——美帝国主义的阴谋。
    双方认为：在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲等地区出现的反对以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义的民族民主独立运动空前高涨，这些广泛的人民群众斗争是相互支持，相互鼓励，发展了保卫亚洲和世界和平的强大力量，给了帝国主义以沉重的打击。但是，美帝国主义至今仍在占领着属于日本领土的冲绳岛、小笠原群岛，并侵占着属于中国领土的台湾，积极在进行扩军备战，设置军事基地，继续在加强着侵略体系。双方认为：美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人，也是亚洲和全世界爱好和平人民的共同敌人，两国青年与妇女必须继续加强团结，相互支持，同美帝国主义进行坚决斗争。
    日本总评青年与妇女代表团确认：台湾永远是中国领土的一部分，反对美帝国主义和一切反动势力制造“两个中国”的侵略阴谋，坚决支持中国人民维护自己领土主权完整解放台湾的斗争。为了促进中日两国青年与妇女的友好往来、恢复中日邦交，对采取敌视中国政策、企图阻挠中日两国人民和青年友谊的反动势力进行斗争。中华全国青年联合会表示：中国青年坚决支持日本人民和青年反对日美军事同盟条约、反对美国军事基地和收复冲绳的斗争；坚决支持日本青年和妇女为实现日本独立、民主、和平、中立的斗争。
    为了反对帝国主义、保卫和平、争取不同社会制度国家的和平共处，双方对下列各点取得了完全一致的看法：
    1、拥护和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则；
    2、坚持开展争取全面裁军、禁止核武器和撤销一切外国军事基地的斗争；
    3、支持周恩来总理提出的关于亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国签订一个互不侵犯的和平公约，并且使这个地区成为无核武器区的建议；
    4、支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民的反对帝国主义、殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立的斗争。
    日本总评青年与妇女代表团表示：日本青年与妇女正在继续为废除新日美“安全条约”，为阻止复活日本军国主义，反对企图复活日本军国主义的反动教育和反对强迫实行侵犯工人生活和权利的“企业合理化”，反对镇压和平民主运动的反动法案，进一步加强团结，积极进行斗争，并站在斗争的前列。
    双方确认：在反对帝国主义、保卫和平的共同斗争中，中日两国青年与妇女将继续相互尊重和支持，两个组织之间的了解、友好和团结，通过互相访问和经常交换活动的文献和资料，将进一步加深和发展。
