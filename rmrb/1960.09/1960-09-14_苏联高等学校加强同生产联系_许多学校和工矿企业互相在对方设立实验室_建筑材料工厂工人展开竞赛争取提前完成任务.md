Xinhua News Agency, Moscow dispatch: According to Soviet press reports: The connection between Soviet institutions of higher learning and production units, as well as the coordination between scientific research work and national economic construction tasks, is being strengthened and its forms are becoming more diverse.

Many institutions of higher learning have signed economic contracts with factories and construction enterprises to carry out relevant scientific research. The Moscow Higher Technical School, the Leningrad and Gorky City Engineering Colleges are engaged in research on the program control and automation of machine tools. Professors and teachers from some other universities are also working on the overall automation of blast furnace operation, automatic coal mining equipment, and remote control devices. In order to link scientific research with the task of improving labor productivity, the Ural Institute of Technology has established a laboratory responsible for studying how to organize production and practice thrift. In a short period of time, it has carried out a great deal of work to unify the technical, industrial, and financial plans of enterprises, and studied how to rationally allocate working hours in chemical plants. Many production projects have adopted the scientists' suggestions, which have already produced economic benefits.

The Kuibyshev Institute of Technology adopted a new form of scientific research: establishing a laboratory in the State Fourth Bearing Factory, responsible for designing and promoting advanced cutting tools used by automatic machine tools in production. The research work is carried out according to the plan approved by the college and the factory. The laboratory staff work with the factory's workers and engineers to conduct experiments and production tests. Some research work is carried out directly in production. The laboratory's exploration has reduced the unit consumption of cutting tools in automated turning workshops by two-thirds, saving a lot of material and financial resources.

Some enterprises have also established laboratories in universities. In 1958, the Kuibyshev National Economic Council organized six scientific research laboratories in a university. These laboratories have been of great help to the machine manufacturing enterprises in the economic zone. Due to the success of this experience, ten more laboratories were organized in some universities last year. This year, the number of such laboratories has increased to thirty. Learning experimental factories have also been organized in universities.

Under the initiative of the Party organization, the Department of Architecture of the Ural Institute of Technology has set up a two-year technical innovation university for construction workers. The Sverdlovsk District Committee of the Party held a college to impart advanced experience for workers in small enterprises, with university teachers giving lectures on a voluntary basis. Professors and teachers from various universities also regularly go to enterprises to give reports. Scientists from the Ural Institute of Technology have given more than 2,000 reports in industrial enterprises and held 350 scientific seminars with practitioners in the past year.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th Telegram Soviet Union pays attention to developing the production of building materials industry, so as to speed up the construction.

The Soviet Union's investment in the development of the construction industry and the building materials industry this year amounts to 17 billion rubles; many new building materials industrial enterprises will be completed. The most important of these are: more than 100 large-panel housing construction factories, 19 cement factories with strong production capacity, and some factories producing reinforced concrete components.

With the completion of new enterprises and the improvement of the productivity of existing enterprises, the Soviet Union's output of prefabricated reinforced concrete components this year will increase to 29 million cubic meters, cement output will reach 45 million tons, and glass output will reach 14.5 million square meters, all of which will exceed the previous year's output. At present, construction workers in building materials factories all over the Soviet Union are launching a competition to strive for early completion of factory construction tasks; workers in existing building materials factories are also making guarantees in the competition to produce more building materials for the country than planned.

    苏联高等学校加强同生产联系
    许多学校和工矿企业互相在对方设立实验室
    建筑材料工厂工人展开竞赛争取提前完成任务
    新华社莫斯科电　据苏联报刊报道：苏联高等学校同生产单位之间的联系，以及科学研究工作同国民经济建设任务间的配合正在日益加强，其形式也越来越多样化。
    许多高等学校同工矿企业和建筑企业签订了经济合同，进行有关的科学研究。莫斯科高等技术学校、列宁格勒和高尔基市的工科院校正在从事关于机床的程序控制和自动化的研究工作。其他各地的一些高等学校的教授和教师们也在着手研究高炉操作全盘自动化、采煤自动装置和遥控装置等类问题。为了把科学研究同提高劳动生产率的任务联系起来，乌拉尔工学院设立了一个负责研究如何组织生产和厉行节约的实验室。它在很短的期间内，便进行了大量的工作来使企业的技术、工业、财政计划统一化，研究了在化学工厂如何合理支配工作时间的问题。许多生产项目采用了科学家们的建议，已经产生了经济效果。
    古比雪夫工学院采用了这样一种科学研究工作的新形式：在国家第四轴承厂建立了一个实验室，负责设计和在生产中推广自动机床使用的先进切削工具。研究工作是按照这个学院和工厂批准的计划进行的。实验室的工作人员同企业的工人和工程师共同进行试验和生产检验。部分研究工作是直接在生产中进行的。实验室进行的探讨使自动化镟工车间切削工具单位消耗量减少了三分之二，节约了大量物力财力。
    有些企业单位也在高等学校建立了实验室。1958年古比雪夫国民经济委员会在一个高等学校组织了六个科学研究实验室。这些实验室对本经济区的机器制造企业有不少帮助。由于这个经验很成功，去年又在一些高等学校组织了十个实验室。今年，这种实验室已增加到了三十个。在高等学校还组织了学习实验工厂。
    乌拉尔工学院建筑系在党组织的倡议下，给建筑业工作人员设立了为期两年的技术革新大学。斯维德洛夫斯克区党委为小型企业的工作人员举办了一个传授先进经验的学院，由高等学校的教师义务讲课。各高等学校的教授和教师还经常到企业去作报告。乌拉尔工学院的科学家一年来在工业企业中作了两千多次报告，同实际工作者举行了三百五十次科学讨论会。
    据新华社莫斯科11日电　苏联注意发展建筑材料工业的生产，以加快建设速度。
    苏联今年用在发展建筑工业和建筑材料工业方面的投资达一百七十亿卢布；将有许多新的建筑材料工业企业建成。其中最主要的是：一百多座大块板房屋建筑工厂，十九座生产能力强大的水泥工厂，以及一些生产钢筋混凝土构件的工厂。
    随着新企业的建成和原有企业生产力的提高，今年苏联的钢筋混凝土预制构件的产量将增加到二千九百万立方米，水泥产量将达四千五百万吨，玻璃产量将达一万四千五百万平方米，产量都将超过往年。目前，苏联各地建筑材料工厂的建筑工人正在展开竞赛，争取提前完成建厂任务；现有的建筑材料工厂的工人也在竞赛中提出保证，要超计划为国家生产更多的建筑材料。（附图片）
