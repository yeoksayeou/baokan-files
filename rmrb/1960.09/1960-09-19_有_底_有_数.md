Having a "Bottom Line" and "Numbers"	Xu Jiachang

The masses call our grassroots cadres "good family managers," which is a glorious title. A "family manager" should not only have a sincere "red heart" to serve the people but also a clear and intelligent mind, managing internal and external affairs, offering advice, being good at calculations, and having a clear "bottom line" and "numbers" in mind for the "family" they manage.

Recently, I met such a person who had numbers in his mind. This person is Comrade Zhang Shoukai, who was the first to implement the "two-five" system in Wuqiao County, Hebei Province. He was originally the First Secretary of the Wuqiao County Chengguan Commune Party Committee. He was very clear about the commune's assets and knew them like the back of his hand. It is said that the commune's accountants and statisticians were often left speechless by his questions. He usually paid close attention to the investigation and research of various figures. He not only recorded the figures in his notebook but also kept them in his mind, speaking with irrefutable evidence and presenting a pile of figures. During the summer harvest estimation this year, the Zhang Chao Temple Management Area reported the expected yield per mu. Comrade Zhang Shoukai said that they underestimated it, and presented his reasoning, laying out the wheat situation in the three major areas of the management area: south, north, and west, which team's wheat was growing how, how many mu were there, how sparse or dense the seedlings were, and how many catties could be produced. Everyone present nodded in agreement. Sure enough, the actual yield per mu exceeded the management area's estimated yield. The commune members praised Comrade Zhang Shoukai for having a "great memory" and being an "iron abacus." They said, "Secretary Zhang's words come from the cracks of the abacus, with deep roots and accuracy in every sentence. He considers everything for the commune, truly a good family manager for our commune members."

However, I have also seen individual comrades who disregard investigation and research of the actual situation. He said: "I have 'politics' here, but as for numbers, that's trivial, go find the accountant and statistician!" This is wrong. Although accountants and statisticians are the ones who master the figures, a leader who doesn't have the necessary numbers in mind shows that he doesn't "bottom out" the actual situation, and his work is not thorough and meticulous. Without knowing the family assets and having no "numbers" in mind, it is impossible to manage the family and lead. Stalin once sharply satirized those leaders who like to talk nonsense, saying that they would sink any living thing into a torrent of endless nonsense and could not undertake practical leadership work. Our leadership work must be based on investigation and research of specific situations. Taking Comrade Zhang Shoukai as an example again, he kept a diary when participating in labor, recording and statistically analyzing the number of cadres from production teams and management areas participating in labor. When he discovered from the numerical ratio that there were too many meetings, too little learning, and too little labor, and that some cadres were even attending twenty days of meetings in a month, he felt the problem was serious and gradually came up with the leadership method of implementing the "two-five" system, correctly arranging the time for cadres' labor, learning, and meetings. You see, thanks to Comrade Zhang Shoukai's thorough and meticulous work style, he discovered so much "politics" from the figures!

Going deep among the masses, going deep into reality, and going deep into the front line are the working styles that our Party has consistently advocated and adhered to. Being on the front line is certainly better than sitting in the office all the time; but being on the front line is not the same as already going deep. This requires solid work. If you don't have a bottom line or numbers for the actual situation at the grassroots level, you can't be considered to have truly gone deep into the front line, and you can't solve practical problems. Practical work requires real swords and guns, with no room for falsehoods; practical work requires revolutionary pragmatists, not empty politicians. To promote work, we must "bottom out" and have numbers in mind. This requires us to make our work style more and more thorough and meticulous.

    有“底”有“数”	徐家常
    群众称我们的基层干部是“好当家人”，这是一个光荣的称号。“当家人”嘛，不止要有一颗赤诚的为人民服务的“红心”，也要有一个清楚的智慧的头脑，管里管外，出谋划策，善于计算，对自己当的“家”心里有
  “底”有“数”。
    最近我见了这样一个心中有数的人，这人就是河北省吴桥县最早试行“二五”制的张寿凯同志，他原是吴桥县城关公社党委第一书记。他对公社的家底一清二楚，了如指掌。据说社里的会计和统计员们，往往被他问个张口结舌。他平常很注意各种数字的调查研究，他不只是把数字记在本本上，而且记在心头上，一说话就铁证如山，摆出一堆数目字。今年夏收估产，张朝寺管理区汇报预计亩产产量，张寿凯同志说他们估的少，摆理摆据，把这个管理区南部、北部、西部三大片麦子情况摆一遍，哪个队上的哪块麦子长的怎么样，有多少亩，苗稀苗密，能产多少斤，直说的与会人点头称是。果然，收获的结果每亩实产量超出了管理区的估产量。社员夸张寿凯同志“记性大”，是“铁算盘”；他们说：“张书记的话，是从算盘缝里响出来的，根底深，句句准，为社盘算的周到，真是咱社员的好当家人。”
    但是，我也见过个别无视对实际情况调查研究的同志，他说：“要‘政治’我这里有，要数字，那是琐事，去找会计、统计员！”这话错了，固然会计员、统计员是掌握数字的人，但是，一个领导者对必要的数字心中无数，正说明对实际情况的不摸“底”，工作的不深入，不细致。不摸家底，心中无“数”，当家主事做领导是不成的。斯大林就曾尖锐地讽刺过那些爱说废话的领导人，说他们会把任何一件活的事情都沉没到滔滔不断的废话里去，不能担任实际的领导工作。我们的领导工作必须建立在对具体情况的调查研究上。还是以张寿凯同志为例，他参加劳动的时候记日记，日记上记录和统计了很多生产队、管理区干部参加劳动的数字，当他从数字比例上发现会议太多，学习太少，劳动太少，甚至有的干部一月当中开二十天的会时，他就感到问题严重，就逐步想出了执行“二五”制的领导方法，正确地安排了干部劳动、学习和开会的时间。请看，由于张寿凯同志深入细致的工作作风，从数字里发现了多么大的“政治”！
    深入群众，深入实际，深入第一线，是我们党一贯提倡和坚持的工作作风。身在第一线，当然比老坐办公室好；但到了第一线，也还不等于已经深入。这里需要扎扎实实的工作。如果对基层的实际情况无底无数，是算不得真正深入第一线，也解决不了实际问题的。实际工作需要的是真刀真枪，掺不得半点虚假；实际工作需要的是革命的实干家，而不是空头的政治家。要推动工作，必须摸“底”，做到心中有数。这就一定要使我们的工作作风深入又深入，细致又细致。
