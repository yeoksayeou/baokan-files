Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: The Beijing Railway Bureau is promoting the communist style of putting others and the collective before oneself, and the outside before the inside. It is dispatching sufficient empty cars daily to support neighboring railway bureaus in transporting coal, while also actively completing its own coal transportation tasks. Compared to late August, in early September, this railway bureau increased the average daily number of empty cars supporting neighboring bureaus by 156, and the number of cars loaded by the bureau itself also increased by 440.

Currently, nearly half of the goods transported by the Beijing Railway Bureau are coal, most of which is coking coal for supply to major steel bases. At the same time, a large number of empty cars must be dispatched daily to support neighboring railway bureaus in transporting raw materials needed for increased steel production. Therefore, how to simultaneously ensure both loading cars and dispatching empty cars has become a particularly important issue for this bureau in comprehensively completing its transportation tasks. During discussions on the increased production and conservation plan for the last four months of this year, all employees further clarified that they must strengthen the overall concept and resolutely implement the principle of putting others and the collective before oneself, and the outside before the inside, making every effort to improve transportation efficiency, so as to prioritize completing the task of dispatching empty cars to neighboring bureaus while also successfully completing the bureau's own loading tasks.

To this end, the employees of the Beijing Railway Bureau have taken a series of measures. They have formulated comprehensive transportation operation plans on a ten-day basis. The operation plans not only specifically stipulate the number of empty cars capable of loading coal to be dispatched to neighboring bureaus each ten-day period and each day, but also make specific arrangements for the departure locations, operating routes, and delivery times of these empty cars. They stipulate that within the 24 hours of a working day, half of the empty cars must be sent out according to the daily plan in the first 12 hours. Even if the bureau itself loads fewer cars, it must actively send empty cars to neighboring bureaus according to the plan, so that neighboring bureaus can arrange coal loading tasks in a balanced manner. The bureau's Party Committee Secretary and the heads of its subordinate units also personally inspect each group and each car every day to ensure that the task of dispatching sufficient empty cars to neighboring bureaus is completed with quality, quantity, and on time.

The situation of needing to ensure loading for neighboring bureaus while also ensuring loading for oneself is driving the employees of the Beijing Railway Bureau to actively give play to their subjective initiative, seize the central link of unloading cars, and strive to expand the source of empty cars. On the one hand, they are strengthening internal organizational work, transporting cars loaded with goods to unloading locations as quickly as possible. On the other hand, they are vigorously collaborating with factories and enterprises at unloading locations to improve unloading capacity. At present, this bureau has specifically designated fixed operating lines for trains arriving at stations unloading goods in large cities, ports, and steel mills, so that over 70% of important materials such as coal, ore, and limestone are transported using organized direct train methods, and fixed locomotives, vehicles, and sources of goods are used. In this way, when loading, cars are loaded in groups and in order of usage time; there is no need to stop at stations for reorganization en route; there is only one unloading location, and upon arrival, they can be unloaded in groups and in order. This greatly shortens transportation and loading and unloading time. Coal trains from Beijing's Jingxi Coal Mine directly to Tianjin are now five hours faster than before. The time saved is almost enough for a round trip between Beijing's Fengtai Station and Tianjin Station. Tianjin Station and the factories and enterprises in Tianjin City are collaborating to carry out technical modifications to the lines, which has also shortened the station operation time for unloading cars by about five hours compared to the past.

    发扬先人后己先外后内风格　共同完成炼钢物资运输任务
    北京铁路局优先调出空车支援外局
    新华社14日讯　北京铁路局发扬先人后己、先外后内的共产主义风格，每天排出足够空车支援邻近铁路局运煤，同时积极地完成本局的运煤任务。9月上旬和8月下旬比较，这个铁路局平均每天支援邻局的空车增多了一百五十六辆，本局完成的装车数也增多了四百四十辆。
    北京铁路局目前每天运出的货物中，将近一半是煤炭，其中大部分是供应各主要钢铁基地用的焦煤。同时，每天要排出大量空车支援邻近的铁路局，运输增产钢铁所需的原料材料。因此，如何使装车和排空车同时兼顾，就成为这个局在全面完成运输任务中的一个特别重要的问题。在讨论今年最后四个月的增产节约计划时，全局职工进一步明确了必须加强整体观念，坚决贯彻先人后己、先外后内的原则，千方百计提高运输效率，以便在优先完成排出空车给邻局的任务的同时，也能很好地完成本局的装车任务。
    为此，北京铁路局职工采取了一系列的措施。他们按旬编制了运输综合作业方案。作业方案不仅具体规定了每旬、每天向邻局调出能装煤的空车的数量，而且对这些空车发车的地点、运行线路和交车时间都作了具体安排。他们规定，在一个工作日的二十四小时内，必须在前十二小时按日计划送出一半的空车，宁可本局少装车，也要积极向邻局按计划送出空车，使邻局能均衡地安排煤炭装车任务。局党委书记和所属各单位负责人每天还亲自按组按车辆检查，保证按质按量按时地完成给邻局排足空车的任务。
    既要保证邻局装车，又要保证自己装车，这个形势推动着北京铁路局的职工们积极发挥主观能动作用，抓紧卸车这一中心环节，努力扩大空车来源。他们一方面加强企业内部的组织工作，把满载着货物的车辆尽快地运送到卸车地点，一方面同卸车地点的工厂企业大搞协作，提高卸车能力。目前，这个局已经专门给到达大城市、港口和钢铁厂的车站卸货的列车指定固定的运行线，使70％以上的煤炭、矿石、石灰石等重要物资都采取组织直达列车办法运输，并且固定机车、车辆和货源。这样，在装车时就做到成列成组地装，按照使用时间的先后装；中途不需要停站改编；只有一个卸车地点，到达后可以立刻成列成组地卸下。因而大大缩短了运输和装卸时间。由北京京西煤矿直达天津的运煤列车，就比以前快了五个小时，节省下的时间，差不多够在北京丰台车站和天津车站之间跑一个来回。天津车站和天津市卸车的工厂企业协作，大搞线路技术改造，也使卸车的车辆停站作业时间比过去缩短了五小时左右。（附图片）
