Improving the Leadership Level of Production Teams
——An Investigation of the Management Work and Leadership Methods of the Xuejing Brigade, Weitang Commune, Wuxian County
Rural Work Department of the Suzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
Recently, we investigated the management work and leadership methods of production teams in the Xuejing Brigade, Weitang Commune, Wuxian County, Jiangsu. This brigade has ten production teams, 325 households, 1,297 people, 549 full and semi-able-bodied laborers, and 2,049 mu of cultivated land. From the investigation, the second, fourth, and fifth teams are doing better in terms of management, production, and livelihood; the third, seventh, and eighth teams are doing average; and the first, sixth, ninth, and fourteenth teams are not doing so well.

    Having a Strong Leadership Core
    The production teams that are doing well all have a strong leadership core dominated by poor and lower-middle peasants.

    The cadres have a thorough and meticulous work style, and have a set of collective leadership and division of labor system. For example, the second team has a total of five team committee members. The team leader, deputy team leader, and two team committee members are all poor and lower-middle peasants, and only the women's team leader is an upper-middle peasant. With the poor and lower-middle peasants in the dominant position, they always conscientiously implement the Party's policies in their work, closely connect with the masses, and proceed from the interests of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in everything. Taking the establishment of public canteens as an example, there was no accountant when the canteens were first established, and many upper-middle peasants suggested that Dai Guanyuan, an upper-middle peasant commune member, should do the job, saying that he was eloquent, could write and calculate, and would definitely do a good job. But team leader Qin Dabang didn't think so. He knew that Dai Guanyuan liked to take petty advantages. Although he was good at writing and calculating, he could not serve the masses wholeheartedly. Finally, according to the opinions of the majority of the masses, Qin Qiaofu, a poor peasant commune member with a low level of education but honest and diligent, was elected to do the job. At the same time, he actively helped Qin Qiaofu to study culture and improve his professional skills. Although Qin Qiaofu had some difficulties at the beginning, he quickly became familiar with his work, the accounts were clear, and the masses called him "reassuring accountant, satisfactory treasurer," which greatly promoted the consolidation of the canteen.

    Team leader Qin Dabang and other team committee members are all loyal, active, and willing to work, connect with the masses, and are good at collective leadership. In addition to the team leader's overall command, the other committee members are clearly assigned to take charge of production technology, livelihood, women's affairs, and economic affairs. The team committee meets every other day to study the situation and arrange work, and then go down to implement it separately. Team leader Qin Dabang does not take over everything in his work, and gives full play to the role of each committee member. His working method is: "One look, two leads, three turns, and four helps." Look early in the morning to see whether the commune members' attendance and the assignment of farm work by the work group are in line with the production plan; take the lead and set an example in accordance with the quality and quantity of farm work stipulated in the plan; turn around at dusk to check the completion of production tasks and problems of the work group; and help the team committee members and work group leaders to understand and solve problems according to the situation and problems grasped during the day. Qin Dabang's own work is also methodical, without any confusion, and he participates in labor well and contacts the masses frequently.

        Short-term Arrangement and Long-term Planning

    "Seven days of queuing up for three shifts, and three days of skillful arrangement" is the experience of the second and fourth teams in formulating short-term plans. Every seven days, they conduct a queuing up of farm work, a queuing up of labor, and a queuing up of the quantity, quality, and time of task completion, so as to determine labor according to farm work, determine work points according to labor skills, and revise quota remuneration according to the quality requirements of farm work. Then the team makes arrangements every other day, and flexibly arranges the production tasks for two days according to the changing weather conditions, so that the plan is more realistic and easier for the commune members to grasp and implement.

    They grasp the following five aspects in the formulation and implementation of the plan:

    (1) The production plan must be submitted to the commune members for democratic discussion, supplementation, and revision, so that each commune member knows clearly what work to do in these seven days, who will do it, to what extent, when to complete it, and how many work points to get as remuneration. Make the production plan of the team based on the masses.

    (2) The production plan should not only guarantee the tasks and requirements put forward by the brigade, but also link up with the specific situation of the team, adapt to local conditions and times, and flexibly arrange for implementation. For example, the brigade requires that 30 dan of manure per mu of paddy field should be accumulated from July 5th to 25th, and weeding, harrowing, and weeding should be carried out once, and the re-threshing of wheat should be completed. The proportion of labor input is stipulated as 40% each for weeding and harrowing, and manure accumulation, and 20% for wheat re-threshing. The second team arranges according to the actual situation of the team: 414 work points are required for weeding and harrowing 138 mu of paddy fields, 3 work points per mu, and 22 laborers need to be invested every day before the 25th, accounting for 75% of the total labor force; the total task of manure accumulation is 3,638 dan, 1,500 dan have been accumulated, and 2,138 dan are still lacking. Two boats and five working days can accumulate 150 dan of refined fertilizer, which can be completed in 14 days, and only five laborers need to be invested, accounting for 18% of the total labor force; the re-threshing of 43 mu of wheat requires 28 work points, as long as two laborers are arranged, accounting for 7% of the total labor force. Such flexible arrangement can not only complete the task of the brigade, but also meet the actual situation.

    (3) In formulating the production plan, it is necessary to check and revise the labor quota at the same time. The team cadres must personally try out the quota standards posted by the brigade, conduct on-the-spot surveys, and revise the difference quota according to the specifications and requirements of various tasks, the difficulty of operation, the types of tools, the distance of the route, and different natural conditions, so that the quota is more realistic. For example, for manure accumulation, the quota of the brigade is two people and one boat, accumulating 120 dan of river mud per day, and 2 li work points per dan. The team made revisions according to the different seasons: in winter, there is less mud, the time is short, and the weather is cold, completing 100 dan per day, and 1.5 li work points per dan; in summer and autumn, the days are long, and there is more mud, completing 150 dan per day, and 1.8 li work points per dan. Another example is weeding. The quota of the brigade is 3 mu of field per work point, and 3 work points per mu. The team formulates the difference quota of 2 mu of field, 3 mu of field, 4 mu of field, and 5 mu of field per work point according to the actual situation of different fields and the amount of weeds. On the basis of reasonable quota, the quota remuneration is promoted to the field and to the person, and work points are recorded by the piece, avoiding the trouble of holding collective meetings every day to evaluate work and record points.

    (4) In formulating the production plan, it is necessary to have both short-term arrangements and long-term plans, so as to arrange for the next season in the previous season, and to plan for the next year this year. The team cadres reflected: "With such a proactive step, every step is proactive, production is no longer flustered no matter how busy, and farm work is no longer chaotic no matter how much." For example, the second team raises two cows. In the past, during the busy farming season, they had to arrange a laborer to specially graze the cows and cut grass to feed them, which wasted manpower and the efficiency of the cows was not high. The team launched non-essential laborers to cut and store 4,000 to 5,000 catties of dry grass during the slack farming season in the summer and autumn of the previous year, and kept it to feed the cows during the busy farming season of the next year, which can save a laborer who raises cows and put him into field production, and the efficiency of the cows is greatly improved. Another example is weeding and manure accumulation. The general teams have to wait until the transplanting is all over before starting, but they always look ahead and behind, and plan for the long term. After most of the transplanting is completed, they draw 5 to 7 laborers to organize manure accumulation and weeding. As a result, everything is proactive, everything is ahead of schedule, and production is getting better and better.

    (5) Implement "four preventions" and "one reliance" to ensure the realization of the production plan. First, prevent climate change, and have two sets of plans for sunny and rainy days in advance; second, prevent sloppy work, and strengthen inspection and acceptance work; third, prevent the brigade from temporarily drawing labor, and arrange for labor to leave room for maneuver; fourth, prevent accidents involving labor, livestock, and tools, and conscientiously do a good job in labor protection and tool maintenance and management. One reliance is to fully rely on the masses. For example, at the beginning of summer planting this year in the second team, according to the production plan, 10 mu of fields had to be transplanted every day, but due to the lack of laborers for pulling and picking seedlings, the pulling and picking seedlings could not keep up with the needs of transplanting. The team leader spread the problem out and launched the masses to solve it. The masses consciously proposed to draw on the spare time after eating dinner every day, and each person pulled 100 bunches of seedlings, and each person carried a load of seedlings to the field three times a day. After doing this, the transplanting progress was suddenly increased to 13 mu per day.

          Division of Labor and Specialization, Making the Best Use of Talents

    The ten teams of this brigade have reasonably determined the form of labor organization to ensure that production is carried out in an orderly manner. For example, the fourth team has 30 households and 30 laborers. According to the amount of land, the strength of labor, the level of technology, and the backbone force, they are divided into two permanent fixed farming groups, one group has 11 laborers and 71 mu of fields; the other group has 11 laborers and 75 mu of fields. Each group is responsible for the basic farm work in the field from planting to harvesting. The team implements the method of "six unification, six fixation, and three combination" for the two fixed farming groups. The six unification are: unified three guarantees, unified arrangement of life, unified production plan, unified labor quota, unified farming cattle and agricultural implements, and unified manure application; the six fixation are: fixed tasks, fixed land, fixed labor, fixed time, fixed quality, and fixed work points; the three combination are: the combination of team leader and group leader, the combination of regular production and emergency tasks, and the combination of feeder and plowman. At the same time, arrange 8 laborers to do other work: 2 laborers to raise cattle, 2 laborers to plant vegetable fields, 2 laborers to cook, and 2 laborers to engage in handicraft industry, implement professional management, and establish a basic responsibility system; if there are sudden farm work, laborers are drawn from each farming group to form a temporary commando team, and after completing the temporary commando task, they still return to the original farming group to participate in production. The fixed farming group is usually headed by the deputy team leader, and when organizing temporary commando teams, the team leader should also serve as the team leader to strengthen leadership. In this way, the regular work and the temporary work are closely combined.

    The team leaders of the production teams that are doing well all know how to use people. Their experience is "political command in selecting cadres, and making the best use of talents in using labor." For example, the several backbones selected by Chen Honggen, the team leader of the fourth team, are all active activists who are active in their work, selfless, and connect with the masses, and they are all placed in important and appropriate positions according to their specialties. Chen Shanqing, a 56-year-old poor peasant commune member, has been raising cattle for landlords since he was a child, and has decades of rich experience in raising cattle. He was a model cattle raiser during the primary and advanced cooperatives. Team leader Chen Honggen arranged for him to be a feeder. The team originally had a feeder who raised a yellow cow, which was so thin that only 60% of its fat remained, its back bones protruded, and its fur was peeled off. The masses called it "scabby, lazy cow". But when this cow arrived in Chen Shanqing's hands, it was carefully cared for and carefully fed. In three months, it was raised to 90% of its fat, its body was fat and strong, and its fur was shiny. It is precisely because the labor force is used reasonably that the production of this team has always been in the lead, the morale of the masses has always been high, and the commune members praised the team leader for being able to manage the family and plan, and using troops is better than Zhuge Liang.

            Double Leap in Production and Life

    The cadres of the second and fourth teams, which are doing well in production, all attach great importance to arranging the lives of the commune members. As a result, the lives are well arranged, and the production is also leading in every season and over-produced every year. For example, the team leaders of the second and fourth teams personally took charge of strengthening the leadership of the canteen, helping the canteen to improve management and improve the system, and highlighted the development of the canteen's non-staple food production base to ensure that the commune members are well-fed and well-fed. Last year, the canteen of the fourth team also planted two mu of vegetables, but because there was no special arrangement for labor to manage it, the land was wasted and there was no harvest. This year, the team leader learned from the lessons of last year and decided in the spring to draw two special people to plant the canteen's vegetable fields. At that time, some people opposed doing so, saying, "Stealing a chicken and losing rice, affecting agricultural production is no small matter." However, after repeated consideration, the team committee still insisted on drawing a male full laborer with experience in vegetable planting and a female laborer to plant vegetables. This is originally a low-lying area, and there is not much dry land. The team leader and team committee personally inspected the land and made plans, "seizing every inch of land", and used all the 10-sided gaps around the large and small roads, the sides of the canals, and the surrounding of wasteland graves. They planted three mu of pumpkin fields, 3.6 mu of yam fields, taro, weng choy, amaranth, water bamboo, eggplant, long beans, watermelon, and cantaloupe, achieving everywhere melons and vegetables, and continuous seasons. The commune members reflected, "The team leader is concerned, we are at ease, and we are of one mind to improve production."

    The cadres of the production teams that are doing well also pay great attention to the combination of work and rest in production, care about the health of the commune members, and are good at organizing rhythmic labor.

                        × × ×

    Judging from the situation of this brigade, the key factor in doing a good job in the management of the production team depends on the leadership of the brigade. If the work of the production brigade is not organized, changes erratically, and is grasped haphazardly, the work of the production team cannot be done well. After discussions and research with the team cadres, everyone unanimously agreed that the brigade must conscientiously achieve "eight wants and eight don'ts" in leadership methods and management work:

    (1) It is necessary to formulate production plans by season and by period, and assign tasks to the team in a step-by-step and purposeful manner. Do not do whatever you think of, and change erratically.

    (2) Within the scope of the plan, the team should be allowed to plan production and arrange labor according to its own situation. Do not interfere too much or stipulate too rigidly.

    (3) The land, labor, cattle, and tools should be fixed and handed over to the production team for use. Do not draw or transfer them randomly.

    (4) Coordination should be organized according to actual needs. Do not randomly transfer the team's labor without a plan, without preparation, or even regardless of the team's production.

    (5) Rely on the team cadres and the masses to determine all work plans and production measures of the brigade. Do not make subjective decisions without investigation and research.

    (6) Reasonably determine the labor quota for each production after field trials, so that the production team has something to follow. Do not let it go, and let each do its own thing.

    (7) Be good at using the working method of grasping both ends and leading the middle. Do not only grasp the advanced and not help the backward.

    (8) Advocate looking first, then listening, and then discussing, and inspiring and helping the team cadres to come up with ideas. Do not just listen and not look, just instruct and not discuss, take over everything, and be aloof.

　　提高小队的领导水平
　　——吴县渭塘公社雪泾大队经营管理工作和领导方法的调查
　　中共苏州地委农村工作部
      最近，我们到江苏吴县渭塘公社雪泾大队调查了生产小队的经营管理工作和领导方法。这个大队共有十个生产小队，三百二十五户、一千二百九十七人，整半劳力五百四十九人，耕地面积二千零四十九亩。从调查情况看，经营管理、生产、生活搞得较好的有二、四、五三个小队；搞得一般的有三、七、八三个小队；搞得不大好的有一、六、九、十四个小队。
    有一个坚强的领导核心
    生产搞得好的小队，都有一个贫农下中农占优势的坚强的领导核心。
  干部的作风深入细致，有一套集体领导分工负责的制度。如第二小队共五个队委委员。队长、副队长以及两个队委委员都是贫农、下中农，只有妇女队长是上中农。在贫农、下中农占优势的情况下，他们在工作中总是认真执行党的政策，密切联系群众，处处从广大贫农、下中农的利益出发。以办公共食堂来说，开始办食堂没有会计，不少上中农提议叫上中农社员戴关元干，说他能说能道，会写会算，准能干得好。小队长秦大邦却不这样看，他了解戴关元爱占小便宜，写写算算虽好，但不能全心全意为群众办事。最后根据多数群众的意见，推选文化水平不高，但为人忠厚和勤恳的贫农社员秦巧福来干。同时，积极帮助秦巧福学习文化，提高业务水平。秦巧福开始时虽然有些困难，但很快就熟悉了自己的工作，账目弄得清清楚楚，群众都称他为“放心会计，称心账房”，大大促进了食堂的巩固。
    小队长秦大邦和其他几个队委委员在工作中都是忠心耿耿，积极肯干，联系群众，并且善于集体领导。五个队委委员除队长掌握全面以外，其他委员明确分工掌管生产技术、生活、妇女、经济四方面的工作。队委会隔天碰一次头，研究情况，布置工作，然后分头下去贯彻执行。小队长秦大邦在工作中不包办代替，充分发挥各委员的作用。他的工作方法是：“一看、二带、三转、四帮”。清早看，看社员出勤和作业组支配农活是否和生产计划对头；带头干，按照计划规定的农活质量数量带头树立榜样；黄昏转，检查作业组完成生产任务的情况和问题；晚上帮，根据白天掌握的情况和问题，帮助队委委员和作业组长认识问题，解决问题。秦大邦自己的工作也是有条不紊，丝毫不乱，而且参加劳动好，联系群众多。
        短　安　排　　长　计　划
    “七天三站队，三天巧安排”，是第二、第四小队制订小段计划的经验。他们每隔七天进行一次农活站队，劳力站队，完成任务的数量、质量、时间站队，做到因农活定劳力，因劳力技术定工分，因农活要求质量修订定额报酬。然后小队隔日一安排，根据天时变化等条件灵活布置两天的生产任务，使计划更加切合实际，更加容易为社员掌握而付诸实现。
    他们在制订执行计划中，抓住以下五个环节：
      （1）生产计划必须交给社员民主讨论，补充修正，每个社员都明确知道这七天要干哪些活，谁去干，干到什么程度，什么时间完成，得多少工分报酬。使小队生产计划建立在群众的基础上。
      （2）生产计划既要保证大队提出的任务和要求，又要联系小队的具体情况，因地因时制宜，灵活安排执行。如大队要求7月5日到25日完成每亩水稻田积肥三十担，耘、耥、拔草一遍，结束小麦复打。规定劳力投放的比例是耘耥、积肥各40％，小麦复打20％。第二小队联系本队情况来安排：一百三十八亩水稻的耘耥拔草，每亩三工，需要四百十四工，25日以前完成每天需投放二十二个劳力，占总劳力数75％；积肥总任务为三千六百三十八担，已积一千五百担，尚缺二千一百三十八担，两只船五个劳动日积精肥一百五十担，十四天即能完成，只需投放五个劳力，占总劳力18％；四十三亩小麦的复打，需要二十八个工，只要安排两个劳力，占总劳力7％，如果利用四个等外劳力七天就可完成。这样灵活安排，既完成大队的任务，又切合实际情况。
      （3）制订生产计划，必须同时检查修订劳动定额。大队挂牌的定额标准，小队干部必须亲自试工，实地勘察，根据各项任务的规格要求，操作难易、工具种类、路途远近以及不同的自然条件，因地制宜修订差别定额，使定额更加切合实际。如积肥，大队的定额两个人一条船，每天积一百二十担河泥，每担二厘工。小队根据不同季节情况作了修订：冬季泥少、时短、天冷，每天完成一百担，每担一点五厘工；夏秋季日长，泥多，每天完成一百五十担，每担一点八厘工。又如拔草，大队的定额每工拔三亩田，每亩三分工。小队根据不同田块、杂草多少的实际情况，分别制订每工拔二亩田、三亩田、四亩田、五亩田的差别定额。在合理定额的基础上，推行定额报酬到田、到人，按件记工，避免天天集体开会评工记分的麻烦。
      （4）制订生产计划，既要短安排，又要长计划，做到前季为后季安排，今年为明年打算。小队干部反映：“这样一步主动，步步主动，生产再忙也不慌，农活再多也不乱。”如第二小队养两条牛，过去每年农忙时要安排一个劳力专门放牛、割草喂养，这样既浪费人工，耕牛耕作效率也不高。小队就在隔年夏秋农闲时，发动等外劳力割储四、五千斤干草，留到次年农忙时喂养耕牛，可以节省一个养牛的劳力，投入田间生产，耕牛的耕作效率也大大提高。又如耘耥、积肥，一般的队都要到蒔秧全部结束才开始，但他们总是瞻前顾后，长远打算，在莳秧完成大部分以后，就抽出五至七个劳力组织积肥、耘耥，结果事事主动，样样抢先，生产越搞越好。
    （5）实行“四防”“一依靠”，保证生产计划实现。一防气候变化，事先有晴雨两套打算；二防干活马虎草率，切实加强检查验收工作；三防大队临时抽调劳力，安排劳力留有余地；四防劳力、耕畜、工具发生事故，认真做好劳力、耕畜的劳动保护和工具的检修保管。一依靠是充分依靠群众。如二小队今年夏种开始时，按生产计划每天要移栽十亩田，但由于拔秧挑秧的劳力太少，拔秧挑秧跟不上栽秧的需要，莳莳等等，断断续续，一天只莳了三亩九分。小队长就把问题摊开，发动群众来解决，群众自觉提出每天抽吃完晚饭的空隙，每人拔一百把秧，一天三次出工时，每人挑一担秧下田。这样做了以后，使莳秧进度一下子提高到每天莳十三亩。
          分工分业　人尽其才
    这个大队的十个小队，都合理确定了劳动组织形式，保证生产有秩序地进行。如第四小队，三十户，全队三十个劳力，根据土地多少、劳力强弱、技术高低、骨干力量划分为两个常年固定耕作组，一个组十一个劳力，七十一亩田；另一个组十一个劳力，七十五亩田。划片包干负责田间基本农活，从种到收，一管到底。小队对两个固定耕作组实行“六统一，六固定，三结合”的方法。六统一是：统一三包，统一安排生活，统一生产计划，统一劳动定额，统一耕牛农具，统一积肥施肥；六固定是：定任务，定土地，定劳力，定时间，定质量，定工分；三结合是：队长与组长结合，经常生产与突击任务结合，饲养员和犁田手结合。同时安排八个劳力干其他工作：两个劳力养牛，两个劳力种蔬菜地，两个劳力烧饭，两个劳力从事手工业，实行专业专管，建立起基本的责任制度；如遇到突击性的农活，便从各耕作组抽调劳力组成临时性的突击组，完成临时性的突击任务以后，仍回原耕作组参加生产。固定耕作组平时一般由副队长兼任组长，在组织临时突击组时，也要由队长担任组长，切实加强领导。这样就把经常性的工作和临时性的工作密切结合起来。
    生产搞得好的小队，小队长都很懂得怎样用人，他们的经验是“挑选干部政治挂帅，使用劳力人尽其才”。如第四小队队长陈洪艮选拔的几个骨干，都是工作积极、大公无私、联系群众的积极分子，而且都根据他们的特长，把他们放在既重要又恰当的位置上。五十六岁的贫农老社员陈善庆，从小就给地主放牛，养牛有几十年的丰富经验，初级社高级社时期他都是养牛模范，队长陈洪艮就安排他当饲养员。小队里原来一个饲养员养的一条黄牛，瘦得只剩六成膘，背骨凸出，皮毛脱光，群
  众称它“癞皮贪懒牛”。但这条牛到了陈善庆手里，精心护理，细心饲养，三个月就养到九成膘，身子又肥又壮，皮毛又光又亮。正因为劳
  力使用得合理，这个队生产始终领先，群众情绪始终高涨，社员称赞小
  队长会当家，会打算，用兵胜过诸葛亮。
            生产生活双跃进
    生产搞得好的第二、第四小队的干部，都十分重视安排社员的生活，结果生活搞好了，生产也是季季领先，年年超产。如第二、第四小队的队长都亲自挂帅加强食堂的领导，帮助食堂改进管理，健全制度，并突出抓住了发展食堂的副食品生产基地，保证社员吃饱吃好。去年四小队食堂也曾种过二亩地蔬菜，但因为没有专门安排劳力去管理，结果荒了地，种了没有收。今年队长接受去年的教训，在春天就决定抽出两个专人种植食堂的蔬菜地。当时有人反对这样做，说什么：“偷鸡不着蚀把米，影响农业生产了不起。”但是队委会经过反复考虑，仍旧坚持抽出一个种菜有经验的男整劳力和一个女劳力来种蔬菜。这里原是低洼地区，旱地不多，队长、队委就亲自察看土地，进行规划，“见缝插针，寸土不让”，把大小路边、渠道两旁、荒坟周围的十边隙地全部利用起来，种了三亩田南瓜、三亩六分田山芋、芋艿、翁菜、苋菜、茭白、茄子、长豆和西瓜、香瓜，做到了遍地瓜菜，季季不断。社员反映“队长操心，我们放心，搞好生产一条心”。
    生产搞得好的小队，干部还十分注意生产中的劳逸结合，关心社员的身体健康，善于组织有节奏的劳动。
                        ×　　　 ×　　　×
    从这个大队的情况来看，要搞好生产小队的经营管理工作，很大因素取决于大队的领导。如果生产大队的工作没有头绪，朝令夕改，乱抓一通，生产小队的工作也就不能搞好。经过和小队干部座谈研究，大家一致认为大队在领导方法和管理工作上，必须切实做到“八要八不要”：
      （1）要分季分段制订生产计划，有步骤有目的地向小队交代任务，不要随想随做，朝令夕改。
      （2）要在计划范围内，允许小队根据自己的情况计划生产、安排劳力，不要干涉过多，规定过死。
      （3）要把土地、劳力、耕畜、工具固定交给生产小队使用，不要随便乱抽乱调。
      （4）要根据实际需要组织协作，不要无计划、无准备，甚至不顾小队的生产，乱调小队的劳力。
      （5）要依靠小队干部和群众来确定大队的一切工作计划和生产措施，不要不经调查研究，主观作出决定。
    （6）要经过实地试验，合理确定各项生产的劳动定额，使生产小队有所遵循，不要放任自流，各搞一套。
      （7）要善于运用抓两头、带中间的工作方法，不要只抓先进，不帮落后。
    （8）要提倡先看后听再商量，启发帮助小队干部出主张，不要光听不看，光指示不商量，包办代替，高高在上。
