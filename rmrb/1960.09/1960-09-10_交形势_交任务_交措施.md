Editor's Note

    Explain the Situation, Explain the Tasks, Explain the Measures
    In the movement to increase production and practice economy, how can we fully unleash the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and rapidly translate it into production? The experience of the Kailuan Zhao Gezhuang Coal Mine is: We must focus on political and ideological work. And the main content of political work should first pay attention to: explaining the situation, explaining the tasks, and explaining the measures.

    China's socialist construction, whether on the agricultural front or the industrial front, presents a vigorous and prosperous scene everywhere. This is an excellent situation. Tell the masses about this excellent situation, and then explain to the masses the great significance of launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy by taking advantage of the excellent situation, vigorously developing agriculture, vigorously developing grain production, and substantially increasing steel production, and point out the specific paths and specific measures for realizing increased production and practicing economy. When the broad masses accept this task, their vigorous fighting spirit will be closely combined with the current specific goals of struggle, forming a huge force to promote production.

    To achieve this step, the tasks and measures must be explained to the masses in detail and thoroughly. To explain in detail means to earnestly, comprehensively, and meticulously tell the masses the tasks and the objective and subjective conditions for completing the tasks, the favorable and unfavorable conditions, the human and material conditions, to mobilize and organize the masses to conduct in-depth and meticulous research and discussion, to raise questions, to find contradictions, and to think of ways and find measures. To concentrate the opinions of the masses and then implement them among the masses, so that the broad masses of workers and staff have a clear understanding of the production situation and are as familiar with it as the palm of their hand. To explain thoroughly means to tell the masses the specific plans allocated by the state, so that the workers and staff of each tunneling team, each working face, each workshop, blast furnace, and converter, and the workers and staff of each work area, construction site, and work team understand the tasks of the entire enterprise and also understand their own tasks, so that each task can be implemented to the individual. At the same time, it is also necessary to do a good job in the work of family members, explain the current situation and tasks to the families of workers and staff, so that all families have a deep understanding of righteousness, are well-known to every family, and actively participate in the movement to increase production and practice economy, creating better conditions for workers and staff and doing a good job in production.

    Explaining the situation, explaining the tasks, and explaining the measures to the masses is only the beginning of the movement to increase production and practice economy. As for how to effectively implement the various measures and ensure the completion of production tasks, leading cadres at all levels must go to work with the masses to tackle key problems and formulate practical and detailed methods to ensure that each measure is earnestly implemented and that the level of production continues to increase.

### 交形势　交任务　交措施

    交形势　交任务　交措施
    在增产节约运动中怎样把群众的积极性和创造性充分发挥出来，并且，迅速地反映到生产中去？开滦赵各庄煤矿的经验是：要抓政治思想工作。而政治工作的主要内容，首先要注意：交形势、交任务、交措施。
    我国的社会主义建设事业，不论在农业战线或工业战线，到处都呈现着蓬蓬勃勃的兴旺景象，这是一派大好形势。把这一派大好形势告诉给群众，再向群众讲明乘着大好形势开展增产节约运动。大办农业、大办粮食以及大幅度增产钢铁的重要意义，指出实现增产节约的具体道路、具体措施，广大群众接受了这个任务，他们的旺盛斗志就会同当前的具体奋斗目标密切结合起来，形成一股推动生产的巨大力量。
    要做到这一步，必须把任务、措施向群众交细、交透。交细，就是认真地、全面地、细致地把任务和完成任务的客观条件、主观条件、有利条件、不利条件、人的条件、物的条件都告诉群众，发动和组织群众深入细致地研究讨论，提问题，找矛盾；想办法，找措施。把群众的意见集中起来，再贯彻到群众中去，让广大职工群众对生产的情况一清二楚，了如手掌。交透，就是要把国家分配的具体计划告诉群众，使每个掘进队、每个掌子面、每个车间、高炉、转炉的职工，每个工区、工地、工作队的职工都明了整个企业的任务，也明了自己的任务，使项项任务都能落实到人。同时，还要做好家属工作，把当前的形势和任务，向职工家属交代清楚，让所有家属深明大义，家喻户晓，积极投入增产节约运动，为职工创造更好的条件，搞好生产。
    向群众交形势、交任务、交措施，还只是增产节约运动的开始，至于如何切实有效地贯彻执行各项措施，保证生产任务的完成，还必须要各级领导干部同群众一道到劳动中去攻关键，订出切实细致的办法来，保证每一项措施认真实行，保证生产水平不断增长。
