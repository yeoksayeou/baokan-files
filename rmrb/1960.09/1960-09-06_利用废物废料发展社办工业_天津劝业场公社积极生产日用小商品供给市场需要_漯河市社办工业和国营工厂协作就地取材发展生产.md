Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 5th: The first people's commune in Tianjin centered on a large department store – the Quan'yechang People's Commune – actively develops community-run industry by utilizing the scraps and waste materials from large factories, according to market needs, and actively produces daily-use small commodities, playing a role of "picking up the slack" in market supply, while also developing its community-run industry.

This commune is located in Tianjin's commercial center, including Tianjin's two larger department stores – Quan'yechang and Women and Children's Goods Store – as well as 216 shops and outlets. Since its establishment in April this year, the commune has made the development of small commodity production its important task according to the needs of the market. Taking the two major department stores as the center, and linking up with more than ten purchasing stations and wholesale departments for general merchandise, cultural supplies, hardware, and electrical appliances, regular meetings are held. The commercial departments put forward the small commodities needed by the market, and the commune tries every means to organize production. Community-run factories regularly supply more than 100 kinds of small commodities to the two major department stores, meeting market needs in some daily-use small commodities.

In developing production, the Quan'yechang Commune mobilized the masses to utilize the scraps and waste materials from large factories as raw materials, and established 45 small comprehensive utilization factories and workshops, producing more than 40 kinds of small commodities. For example, the scraps of yellow wax cloth used for oil pump gaskets were woven into handbags, the scraps of woolen clothing were combined into blocks to make variegated corduroy clothes and toys, broken iron pieces were used to make stove racks, and various scraps and waste materials were used to produce mops, rackets, etc., which were of good quality and low price, and very popular.

In producing small commodities, the Quan'yechang People's Commune first focused on the problem that a large number of housewives who had joined social labor did not have much time to sew clothes and shoes, and established factories for casual wear, children's clothing, children's shoes, children's bibs, and hats, etc., using raw materials supplied by the department stores to produce a large number of women's and children's clothing in various colors and varieties. In addition, according to the rapid development of childcare organizations and the greatly increased demand for children's woodenware, a children's woodenware factory was established to produce small beds, small chairs, rocking horses and other woodenware for children to supply the market.

Thanks to the support of community-run factories, the source of small commodities needed by the two major department stores was guaranteed. In the past, some of the small commodities operated by the two major department stores needed to be purchased from other places, and due to difficult production and transportation conditions, they often could not be supplied normally. Now the commune sets up special factories or workshops to produce according to the needs of the department stores, which basically guarantees the supply. Because community-run factories can utilize scraps and waste materials from large factories and arrange production in a planned way according to the needs of large department stores, the raw materials and sales channels are guaranteed, and the output and output value of small commodity production have been rising month by month, and the varieties have increased from more than 90 in the past to more than 200, and the quality of products has also been continuously improved, realizing an all-round leap forward.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 5th: The community-run industry in Luohe City, Henan Province, has found an inexhaustible source of raw materials and broad production avenues by cooperating with state-owned factories and vigorously promoting comprehensive utilization of waste materials. In the second quarter of this year, the number of community-run factories in the city increased from 29 to 120, and production developed rapidly.

Luohe City is a small city with a population of more than 70,000. There are many state-owned factories in the urban area, and there are abundant scraps and waste materials that can be utilized. Waste materials such as slag, charcoal slag, ore powder, and bluestone powder left over from steel plant production have piled up into three small hills. The leather and shoe factories alone leave about one ton of broken leather scraps and waste hair every day. However, many community-run factories in the city used to produce large products with high output value, ignoring the utilization of local materials and waste materials. They often felt that there was a shortage of raw materials, and even sent people to purchase raw materials from outside the province, or waited for the state to allocate them, so that production could not develop normally. In view of the above situation, the Luohe Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China called on community-run factories to actively serve state-owned factories and establish satellite factory groups with the larger state-owned factories in the area as the core. After more than two months, more than 70 satellite factories were established throughout the city, actively serving state-owned factories in terms of products and labor, ensuring that state-owned factories better completed the state production plan. State-owned factories also strongly supported community-run satellite factories in terms of technology and equipment, and supplied scraps and waste materials to community-run factories for utilization, charging only a low material cost.

The workers in Luohe City's community-run factories diligently studied and learned in the process of utilizing waste materials. Under the thatched sheds, in the open spaces, and next to the red furnaces of community-run factories, experimental products of technical groups could be seen everywhere. Every time they made one, they would test it on the spot or send it to a state-owned factory for testing. If it failed, they would do it again, and after it was done, they would test it again. Once it succeeded, it would be put into production. The workers also visited and learned technology inside and outside the city, and state-owned factories also gave them a lot of help, so now they have mastered many technologies for using indigenous methods to vigorously utilize waste materials.

The workers in the community-run factories not only turned useless things into useful things, but also achieved multiple uses for one thing and utilization of everything. They first selected the large pieces of scrap iron left over from the state-owned machinery manufacturing factory and cut them into iron spoons, and then successively made lock stops, thimbles, and trouser hooks until they could no longer be used, then they were returned to the furnace. In terms of cotton stalk utilization, they first peeled off the cotton stalk skin, which could be used to make fiber woven twill cloth and extract starch, and the remaining residue could also be used to feed pigs. The waste liquid after extracting starch was also used to make soy sauce, tannin, and chemical raw materials. In this way, every 100 jin of cotton stalk skin can yield a net profit of 30 to 40 yuan. The workers in the state-owned tannery's community-run satellite factory utilized the loose hair scraped from the leather, the tender meat of the pasted leather, and the scraps of leather of different thicknesses and sizes to make more than ten products such as gelatin, fertilizer, felt, woolen cloth, shoe soles, schoolbags, tote bags, and travel bags. The quality is very good and is deeply loved by the majority of customers.

    利用废物废料发展社办工业
    天津劝业场公社积极生产日用小商品供给市场需要
    漯河市社办工业和国营工厂协作就地取材发展生产
    据新华社天津5日电　天津市第一个以大商场为中心的公社——劝业场人民公社，根据市场需要，利用大工厂的下脚料、废料发展社办工业，积极生产日用小商品，在市场供应方面起到了“拾遗补缺”的作用，社办工业也得到发展。
    这个公社在天津市商业集中的地区，包括天津市较大的两个商场——劝业场和妇女儿童用品商店，以及二百一十六个商店和门市部。公社从今年4月份成立以后，就根据商场需要把发展小商品生产当作自己的重要任务，以两大商场为中心，并同百货、文化用品、五金交电等十多个采购站和批发部挂钩，定期召开会议，商业部门提出市场需要的小商品，公社就千方百计组织生产。社办工厂经常供应两大商场的小商品达一百多种，在一些日用小商品方面满足了市场需要。
    劝业场公社在发展生产中，发动群众利用大工厂的下脚料、废料作原料，建立了四十五个综合利用小厂和车间，生产出了四十多种小商品。例如利用作油泵垫的黄腊布的下脚料编成了手提篮，用绒衣下脚料并成块做成杂色的条绒衣和玩具，用碎铁片制成炉架，用各种下脚料、废料生产墩布、球拍等，物美价廉，很受欢迎。
    劝业场人民公社在生产小商品中，首先针对大批家庭妇女参加社会劳动以后，没有很多时间缝作衣、鞋的问题，建立了便服、童装、童鞋、小孩围嘴、帽子等工厂，用商场供给的原料，大量生产多种花色品种的妇女儿童服装。另外，根据托儿组织迅速发展，儿童木器需要量大大增加的特点，建立了儿童木器厂，生产小床、小椅、摇马等儿童用的木器，供应市场。
    由于社办工厂的支持，两大商场所需的小商品来源有了保证。过去，两大商场经营的一部分小商品，需要从外地进货，由于生产、运输等条件困难，往往不能正常供应。现在公社根据商场的需要，设专厂或车间生产，基本上保证了供应。由于社办工厂能利用大工厂下脚料、废料，根据大商场的需要有计划地安排生产，原料和销路有了保证，小商品生产的产量和产值逐月上升，品种由过去的九十多种增加到二百多种，产品质量也不断提高，实现了全面跃进。
    新华社郑州5日电　河南省漯河市社办工业通过和国营工厂协作，大搞废物综合利用，找到了取之不尽的原料来源和广阔的生产门路，在今年第二季度内，全市社办工厂由二十九个增加到一百二十个，生产迅速发展。
    漯河市是一个拥有七万多人口的小城市，市区范围内国营工厂林立，有丰富的边角废料可以利用。钢铁厂生产剩下来的炉渣、炭渣、矿石末和青石末等废料，已经垛起了三座小山。仅制革制鞋工厂每天就要剩下一吨左右的碎皮废毛等。但市内许多社办工厂过去生产一些产值高的大产品，忽视就地取材、废物利用，经常感到原料不足，甚至派人到省外去采购原料，或是坐等国家调拨，使生产不能正常地发展。根据以上情况，中共漯河市委号召社办工厂积极为国营工厂服务，以当地较大的国营工厂为核心，建立卫星厂群。经过两个多月时间，全市共建立起七十多个卫星工厂，从产品和劳力等方面积极为国营工厂服务，保证国营工厂更好地完成国家生产计划，国营工厂也从技术、设备等方面大力扶持社办卫星工厂，并把下脚废料供给社办工厂利用，只收较低廉的材料成本费。
    漯河市社办工厂工人们在废物利用过程中，苦心钻研、学习。社办工厂的麻棚下、空地上、红炉旁，到处都可以看见技术小组的试验品，他们每制成一项就实地检验或送到国营工厂化验，失败了再做，做了再检验，一旦成功便投入生产。工人们还到市内外参观学习技术，国营工厂也给了他们很多帮助，因而现在掌握了许多用土法大搞废物利用的技术。
    社办工厂的工人们不仅变无用为有用，并且作到了一物多用和样样利用。他们把国营机械制造工厂用剩的废铁片，先选择其中大的剪制铁勺，然后再依次制锁档、做顶针、做裤勾，直到实在不能再用时才回炉；在棉秆利用方面，他们先剥下棉秆皮，用秆皮可以制纤维织斜纹布，提取淀粉，剩下的残渣还可以喂猪；又用提取淀粉后的废液制取制作酱油、栲胶和化工原料。这样，每百斤棉秆皮可以净得收益三、四十元。国营制革厂的社办卫星工厂的工人们把皮革上刮下来的乱毛、贴皮嫩肉，以及剪裁剩下来的厚薄大小不等的碎皮革，利用起来制成了明胶、化肥、毛毡、呢子、鞋底、书包、提兜、旅行袋等十多种产品，质量很好，深受广大顾主的欢迎。
