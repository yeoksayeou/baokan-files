Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 23rd. The flames of struggle against the US-Ngo clique by the people of Southern Vietnam, who have the tradition of the "September 23rd" Resistance, have burned across the South. The slogans "Down with the US-Ngo Clique" and "US Imperialism Get Out of South Vietnam" can be heard everywhere in the South.

According to reports from Southern Vietnam, from the beginning of this year to the present, from Quang Tri province near the southern end of the military demarcation line to Ca Mau Cape, millions of South Vietnamese people have participated in the struggle against the US-Ngo clique. They distributed countless leaflets and slogans against the US-Ngo clique in various places, and even planted revolutionary red flags on the roofs of the US-Ngo clique's bunkers, public security organs, governor and district chief residences, barracks, and prisons. Anti-US-Ngo clique leaflets also appeared in cities such as Saigon, the center of US-Ngo clique rule.

During this period, the people of Southern Vietnam held tens of thousands of rallies and demonstrations to oppose the fascist rule of the US-Ngo clique. Sometimes, as many as thousands of people participated in the rallies, including not only workers, peasants, small vendors, and intellectuals, but even some patriotic capitalists. Some demonstrations were held at night.

The rivers of Southern Vietnam have become convenient conditions for the Southern people to oppose the US-Ngo clique. On the Saigon River, the Tien River, the Hau River, Dong Thap Muoi, West Thap Muoi, Dong Nai River, and the Perfume River passing through Hue city, rafts made of banana trees often appear, with bright red flags planted on them and slogans against the US-Ngo clique posted. In July of this year, many satirical cartoons of Ngo Dinh Diem selling out the country to his American masters also appeared at traffic arteries and crossroads in many areas of Southern Vietnam.

In the countryside of many provinces in Southern Vietnam, the broad masses of peasants, regardless of the US-Ngo clique's brutal "sweeps" and suppression, resolutely opposed the US-Ngo clique's "strategic hamlet" policy. The people in these areas forced the soldiers of Ngo Dinh Diem's army to evacuate the "strategic hamlets," burned down the "strategic hamlets," and returned to their hometowns. In some areas, such as the western part of Quang Ngai province, the people even used force to oppose the US-Ngo clique's military "sweeps" that forced the people to concentrate, and defeated the US-Ngo clique's henchmen. The people in many areas recovered the land plundered by the US-Ngo clique.

The heroic struggle of the South Vietnamese people has dealt a severe blow to the US-Ngo clique, making them increasingly panic-stricken and disintegrating. Many of Ngo Dinh Diem's running dogs and commandos in many areas, intimidated by the momentum of the people's struggle, confessed their crimes to the people or abandoned their posts and fled. The phenomenon of desertion from Ngo Dinh Diem's army is also increasing. In April alone, nearly 600 soldiers deserted from the Quang Trung military training center; from July 10 to 27, two incidents occurred in a certain barracks in which soldiers shot and killed their commanders and defected to the people.

At present, the struggle of the South Vietnamese people against the US-Ngo clique is developing more vigorously with the US-Ngo clique's frenzied suppression.

　　反对美吴集团的怒火遍燃越南南方
　　各地群众纷纷集会示威反对吴庭艳集团法西斯统治
　　广大农民英勇反击军事“扫荡”并烧毁“稠密区”
    新华社河内23日电　具有“九·二三”抗战传统的越南南方人民的反对美吴集团的斗争火焰已遍烧南方各地，“打倒美吴集团”、“美帝国主义滚出越南南方”的口号在南方到处可以听到。
    据来自越南南方的消息报道，自今年年初到现在，从靠近军事分界线南端的广治省到金瓯角，成百万越南南方人民参加了反美吴集团的斗争。他们在各地散发了无数的反对美吴集团的传单和标语，甚至在美吴集团的碉堡、公安机关、省长及郡长的官邸、兵营、监牢等屋顶上也插上了革命的红旗。在美吴集团统治的中心西贡等城市里也出现了反美吴集团的传单。
    在这期间，越南南方人民举行了成万次集会和游行示威，反对美吴集团的法西斯统治。参加集会的人有时多到成千人，其中不仅有工人、农民、小商贩、知识分子，甚至于包括一些爱国的资本家。有些示威游行是在晚上举行的。
    越南南方各条河流成了南方人民反对美吴集团的便利条件。在西贡河、前江、后江、东草湾、西草湾、同奈河以及经过顺化市的香河等河面上经常出现人民用芭蕉做成的筏子，筏子上面插着鲜艳的红旗，张贴着反对美吴集团的标语。在今年7月间，越南南部许多地区的交通要道和十字路口还出现了许多讽刺吴庭艳向美国主子卖国求荣的漫画。
    在越南南方许多省的农村中，广大农民不顾美吴集团的残酷“扫荡”和镇压，坚决反对美吴集团的“稠密区”政策。这些地区人民逼使吴庭艳军队的士兵撤离“稠密区”，把“稠密区”烧毁，并返回自己的家乡。有的地区，如广义省西部人民，还用武力反对美吴集团强迫集中人民的军事“扫荡”，把美吴集团的爪牙打得落花流水。许多地区人民夺回了被美吴集团掠夺的土地。
    越南南方人民英勇的斗争，给了美吴集团严重的打击，使它们日益陷于惊慌失措、分崩离析的困境。许多地区的吴庭艳集团的走卒和别动队等，慑于人民的斗争气势，纷纷向人民认罪或弃职逃跑。吴庭艳军队开小差的现象也越来越多。仅在今年4月份中，光忠军事训练中心就有近六百名士兵开小差；今年7月10日到27日，在某兵营内爆发了两起士兵开枪打死指挥官投靠人民的事件。
    目前，越南南方人民的反美吴集团的斗争，随着美吴集团的疯狂镇压，正在更加蓬勃的发展。
