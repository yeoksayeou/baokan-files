Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th. The Soviet government has temporarily recalled personnel from the Soviet Embassy in the Congo. The Soviet government issued a statement saying:

    In recent days, due to the conspiracies of colonialists and their running dogs, and the open interference of the "UN forces" headquarters in the internal affairs of the Congo, an extremely tense situation has formed in the Republic of the Congo. The republic's legitimate government and parliament have been abolished. Emissaries from the United States and Belgium, as well as representatives of foreign monopoly capital relying on extensive US support, are interfering more and more openly in the country's political life. In the republic's capital, Leopoldville, and in many major cities and regions across the country, national, political, and economic life has fallen into a state of disarray.

    The statement said that in the course of the Congo events, the undisguised hostile attitude of the leadership groups of the United States and other Western countries towards the Congolese people and their legitimate government has been exposed to the whole world. For the selfish interests of foreign monopoly capital, the colonialists used deception and bribery to put a puppet regime that obeys foreign powers in control. A situation has formed in Leopoldville in which colonialists, using their pawns and all kinds of political swindlers, are adopting dirty provocative means to damage the good relations established between the Soviet Union and the Republic of the Congo.

    The statement said that under these conditions, the Soviet Embassy in the Congo is no longer able to perform its functions normally. The inviolability of the embassy and the safety of embassy personnel have been threatened. Therefore, the Soviet government has decided to temporarily recall the personnel of the Soviet Embassy from the Congo. The statement said: The Soviet Union's attitude towards the young African Republic of the Congo remains unchanged, and remains friendly. In line with its principled policy of supporting the peoples of all countries in their struggle for independent development and freedom, and in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, the Soviet government will continue to fully support and assist the heroic, freedom-loving Congolese people in achieving complete and genuine independence, and oppose all attempts by colonialists to restore the already bygone shameful colonial system in any form on Congolese soil.

    苏联就召回驻刚果使馆人员发表声明
    今后仍将全力支援刚果人民
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科18日讯：苏联政府已暂时召回苏联驻刚果大使馆人员。苏联政府为此发表声明说：
    近几天来，在刚果共和国，由于殖民主义者及其走狗的阴谋，以及“联合国军”司令部对刚果内政的公开干涉，形成了极其紧张的局势。共和国的合法政府和议会被取消了。美国和比利时的密使以及依靠美国广泛支持的外国垄断资本的代表，又在越来越公开地干涉这个国家的政治生活。在共和国的首都利奥波德维尔和国内许多大城市和地区，国家生活、政治生活和经济生活陷入紊乱状态。
    声明说，在刚果事件的过程中，美国和其他西方国家的领导集团对刚果人民及其合法政府采取的不掩饰的敌视态度，已向全世界暴露无遗。为了外国垄断资本的自私利益，殖民主义者用欺骗和收买的办法使一个唯外国人之命是从的傀儡制度掌握政权。在利奥波德维尔形成了这样的局面：殖民主义者利用自己的走卒和形形色色的政治骗子，采取肮脏的挑衅手段来损害苏联同刚果共和国建立的良好关系。
    声明说，在这种条件下，苏联驻刚果大使馆已经不可能正常地履行职能。大使馆的不可侵犯性及使馆人员的安全遭到了威胁。因此，苏联政府决定暂时把苏联大使馆人员从刚果召回。声明说：苏联对年青的非洲共和国刚果的态度仍然不变，仍然是友好的。苏联政府本着自己的支持各国人民争取自立发展和自由的原则性政策，并根据联合国宪章的原则，今后仍将全力支持和援助英勇的、爱好自由的刚果人民取得完全和真正的独立，反对殖民主义者想在刚果土地上以任何形式恢复已经一去不复返的可耻的殖民制度的一切企图。
