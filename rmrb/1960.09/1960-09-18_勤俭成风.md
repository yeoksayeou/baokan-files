    Frugality Becomes a Habit
    By our reporters Gu Ping and Bao Chunguang

    Cadres and members of the Jinfeng Brigade of the Xizhang People's Commune in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, have developed a habit of frugality, working hard and diligently to promote production, and living a careful and thrifty life. Over the past few years, their output has increased year by year, their costs have decreased year by year, their family wealth has become thicker and thicker, and their lives have become better and better.

      Cadres Take the Lead in Diligence and Thrift
    Stepping into the fields of Jinfeng Brigade, you are met with green crops everywhere. The fields are full of rice, the river is covered with dark green and shiny water chestnut leaves, and groups of ducks are playing and competing for food. All kinds of vegetables are planted everywhere on the river banks, along the canals, and around the houses of the commune members. Some commune members are using grass cutters in the fields to chop up green grass and compost it as green manure. Other commune members collect poisonous weeds, mash them into juice, and use them as local pesticides. Here, you can see people paying great attention to careful calculation and thrift everywhere.

    Some members of the Seventh Team are applying fertilizer to the autumn fields. Standing on the ridge, vigorously pouring spoonfuls of manure water into the middle of the field to the farthest point is the brigade leader, Qian Jinbao. The cadres of Jinfeng Brigade, like Qian Jinbao, work with the commune members wherever they go to inspect the work. By the end of July, the brigade cadres had each worked an average of 178 workdays. The cadres not only take the lead in labor themselves, but also mobilize their families to take the lead in labor. The family members of the brigade cadres have each worked an average of 158 workdays, which is more than 10% higher than the average female commune member. The commune members said, "Our cadres know how to manage things, and the cadres' wives also know how to manage things."

    Speaking of Xu Junsheng, the secretary of the brigade's Party branch, the commune members say, "We are all at ease letting Junsheng manage this household." Xu Junsheng, who came from a poor peasant background, served as a soldier in the army for four years. From the day he returned home after being discharged, he devoted his heart and soul to this collective. He handed over the settlement allowance he brought back from the army to the team to develop production. He understood that only by improving collective production could personal life be guaranteed. After he became the branch secretary, he devoted himself even more to the collective. Once, all the cadres went to the county to attend a meeting. One of the cadres saw many colorful daily necessities on the street and wanted to borrow money to buy them. Xu Junsheng said to him: Every penny saved by the team comes from the hard work of the commune members, and we cadres have no right to use it privately. Under Xu Junsheng's influence and education, everyone took the collective interest as the most important thing. Usually, the team tries to save money as much as possible and never pays attention to ostentation. Since the establishment of the commune, except for buying a desk for the accountant, they have never bought any large office supplies. Opening the account book of this brigade, you cannot find a single debt under the names of the brigade cadres. Not only that, but they also save money and live frugally, depositing more than 300 yuan of their savings in the brigade. Among the twenty-one leaders and deputy leaders of the teams, except for two who borrowed some money from the brigade because their family members were sick, after discussion by the commune members and approval by the team leader, the remaining nineteen cadres did not have any advances and also saved more than 500 yuan. The commune members were very satisfied with this and learned from the cadres, living a rich life as if it were a poor one. 80% of the families in the brigade have savings, with a total of more than 2,000 yuan in cash, supporting collective production.

    People United as One, Managing the Big Family Well
    On the wall of the brigade office is posted the final account table for the summer distribution and the income and expenditure accounts for the first half of the year. The income and expenditure accounts for grain and cash for the previous month are also posted on the whitewashed walls of each canteen. During the summer and autumn distributions each year, the brigade shows the accounts to the masses, explaining the income and expenditure of grain and cash item by item to the commune members for review; at the same time, the next production plan and the plan for the use of funds are submitted to the commune members for discussion. When the brigade clears the accounts every quarter, it invites the team leaders, accountants, and commune member representatives to participate. They carefully check whether the receipts are in order, whether the income and expenditure figures are correct, and whether the various expenses are used reasonably. The brigade attaches great importance to every suggestion and criticism made by everyone. Last spring, the brigade bought a batch of salt for seed selection. The deputy secretary in charge of this work forgot to explain it when he went out to attend a meeting. By the time he remembered, the teams had already soaked the seeds, and this batch of salt could not be used. The commune members criticized this matter. The deputy secretary accepted the criticism from the masses and made a serious self-criticism at the mass meeting. This year, the brigade learned from last year's lesson and distributed the salt used for seed selection to the teams as early as possible, so that every grain of rice seed was carefully selected with salt water. The brigade cadres deeply realized that accepting mass supervision in financial matters is an important measure to implement thrift in running the commune and ensure reasonable use of money.

        Know How to Save and Know How to Use
    Rows of bungalows are neatly arranged in the fields. Going inside, you see! The sows are sleeping soundly, the piglets are running all over the pens, each one with a fat head and big ears; all fifty-eight pigsties are full. Several commune members are digging feed ponds in front of the houses.

    Last year, someone suggested using a batch of public accumulation from the brigade to build offices and canteens, buy loudspeakers, and hold meetings more comfortably, so that commune members could listen to records while working in the fields. In response to the emergence of this extravagance idea, the branch immediately organized cadres to study the instructions from higher authorities on running the commune thriftily again. In the end, it was decided to change this plan and use the money for building houses and buying loudspeakers to build fifty-eight simple pigsties and set up a pig breeding farm for the brigade. In addition, fifteen houses were built, eight as canteens, and seven for poor peasant commune members whose houses were dilapidated, so that every commune member said it was good.

    More than 2,000 mu of rice fields in this brigade can now be mechanically irrigated, but you can still see some cattle pulling waterwheels to irrigate. This is what they plan to do: Before the autumn harvest and autumn planting, the cattle are idle, so let them take turns scooping water, which can irrigate more than 600 mu of fields, not only saving production costs, but also reducing the country's diesel supply. This year, the brigade saved more than 5,000 yuan in the three production expenses of pumping fees, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides compared to last year.

    Everyone pays attention to saving, but the team is not stingy with the money that should be used for collective life and welfare. In the summer, there is a large gauze cover on each canteen's dining table. Except for the gauze, which was bought, the rest was made by mobilizing the commune members to use scrap wood and bamboo themselves. Each gauze cover cost only two jiao. The brigade also spent 400 yuan to buy four noodle cutting machines for the canteens. They also repeatedly calculated the accounts when spending this money. Using the noodle cutting machines in the canteens and using the labor saved for field production can earn more grain.

    In the cattle pen of the Fifth Team, a water buffalo is tethered. The herdsman, Zhang Tongsheng, is squatting there, patiently feeding the tender grass into the buffalo's mouth. This buffalo has been raised for twenty years. In other places, it would have been eliminated long ago, but here the herdsman takes special care of it, cutting the fodder into three-inch pieces, feeding it warm food in winter, and tender grass in summer. During the busy summer season, the team leader, Zhang Guiyue, personally uses this buffalo and does not let it get tired. As a result, this old buffalo does as much work as a strong buffalo. Cherishing farm cattle is a good tradition of Jinfeng Brigade. Since mutual aid and cooperation, no cattle have died, and all the cattle in the brigade are raised to be fat and strong.

  The Family Wealth is Getting Thicker and Thicker, and Life is Getting Better and Better
    The people here cherish grain even more. After the summer harvest, the Fifth Team had already sent the threshed wheat to the brigade. The team leader, Zhang Guiyue, found that there were still grains of wheat that had not been threshed clean on the ears of wheat. He mobilized the masses to re-dry and re-thresh, and threshed out more than eighty jin of wheat.

    We have eaten in several canteens in Jinfeng Brigade. There are many varieties of rice, including dry rice, porridge, noodles, and vegetable wontons. The vegetables are also very rich. A large bowl of braised cowpeas or fried chives costs only two fen, and a large bowl of steamed eggplant costs only three fen. The cooks explained: The little money collected is for seasoning fees. In fact, the vegetables are supplied free of charge. On the dining table of every commune member's household are several kinds of food and several large bowls of vegetables. Adults and children eat very happily. The comrades of the brigade calculated an account: The brigade used more than 120 mu of land along the edges of fields to plant melons and vegetables, and the canteen vegetable gardens also planted a large number of melons and vegetables. Eating these melons and vegetables together with grain not only adjusts the taste and improves life, but also saves several jin of grain per person per month. Because they are careful and thrifty, they eat well and save money, and grain reserves are constantly increasing. Now, new wheat and new rice have already been eaten, and the brigade's warehouse is still piled with old rice.

    The cadres and members of Jinfeng Brigade have adhered to the principle of running the commune thriftily for a long time and have achieved very good results. Last year, the brigade's management fee accounted for only 0.18% of the total income, and it will continue to decline this year. They deeply understand the importance of using abundance to make up for deficiency and saving to prevent famine. They are not satisfied with the prosperity of one brigade, but are concerned about the entire commune and the entire country. They sell more grain to the country year by year, and their loans from the country are less year by year. In 1958, they borrowed more than 8,000 yuan, but last year they only borrowed more than 2,000 yuan. This year, they not only did not borrow money from the country, but also have more than 9,000 yuan deposited in the state bank.

    勤俭成风	本报记者　古平　鲍春光
    江苏常熟县西张人民公社金丰大队的干部和社员，勤俭成风气，苦干穷干搞生产，精打细算过日子。几年以来，产量逐年提高，成本逐年降低，家底愈来愈厚，生活愈过愈好。
      干部带头　克勤克俭
    一踏上金丰大队的田野，满是绿色的庄稼。大田亩亩是水稻，河面上浮满乌绿发亮的菱叶，成群的鸭子在嬉游竞食。河坎上、渠道上、社员家前屋后，到处种着各种蔬菜。有些社员在田头用铡草器把青草铡碎，沤制绿肥。还有些社员把有毒的草收集起来，捣成汁，作土农药。在这里，到处可以看到人们十分注意精打细算，勤俭节约。
    第七小队有些人在给秋田追肥。站在田埂上把一勺勺粪水用力往田中间浇得最远的，就是大队长钱金保。金丰大队的干部，个个都像钱金保一样，到哪儿检查工作，就在哪儿和社员一同劳动。到7月底，大队干部平均每人已做了一百七十八个劳动日。干部们不仅自己带头劳动，而且动员家属带头劳动。大队干部家属平均每人已经做了一百五十八个劳动日，比一般女社员超过10％以上。社员们说：“我们的干部会做人家，干部娘子也会做人家。”
    提起大队支部书记徐俊生，社员们说：“让俊生当这个家，我们个个放心。”贫农出身的徐俊生，曾在部队里当过四年战士，从复员到家的那一天起，就把一颗红心交给了这个集体。他把从部队带回的安家费交给队里发展生产。他懂得，只有把集体生产搞好了，个人生活才有保障。他担任支部书记后，更是一心为集体。有一次，全体干部到县里开会，有个干部看到街上有不少花花绿绿的日用品，就想借钱去买。徐俊生对他说：队里存的每一分钱都是社员辛勤劳动得来的，我们当干部的没有权利私自动用。大家在徐俊生的影响和教育下，个个以集体利益为重。平时队里用钱也都是能省就省，从不讲究排场。办社以来，除了给会计买了一张办公桌以外，从未买过什么大的办公用具。打开这个大队的分户往来账，在大队干部名下，找不到一笔欠账。不仅如此，他们还省吃俭用，勤俭持家，把自己节余下来的钱在大队存了三百多元。二十一个正副小队长中，除两人因家人生病，经过社员讨论、队长批准，向大队借了一点钱以外，其余十九个干部也都没有借支过，还存了五百多元。社员们对此非常满意，都学习干部的样子，把富日子当穷日子过。全大队80％的人家有存款，共存现金两千多元，支持集体生产。
    上下一条心　管好大家庭
    大队办公室的墙上贴着夏季分配的决算表和上半年的收支账目。每个食堂的粉墙上也贴着上月份的粮食和现金收支账。大队每年在夏季和秋季分配时，都要向群众摊家底，把粮食和现金的收支情况，逐项向社员交代，让社员审查；同时把下一步的生产规划和经费使用计划交给社员讨论。大队在每季度清算账目时，吸收各小队的队长、会计和社员代表参加。他们认真地检查单据是否合乎手续，收支数字是否对头，各项经费用得是否合理。大家提出的每一项建议和批评，大队都非常重视。去年春天，大队为了选种买了一批盐。负责这一工作的副支书外出开会时忘了交代，等他想起来时，各小队已经浸好了种，这批盐就没能用上。社员们对这件事提出了批评。副支书接受了群众的批评，在群众大会上作了认真的检讨。今年，大队接受了去年的教训，选种用的盐及早发到各小队，使得每一粒稻种都经过了盐水精选。大队干部们深深体会到在财务方面接受群众监督，是贯彻勤俭办社、保证合理用钱的一个重要措施。
        会　省　会　用
    几排平房整齐地排列在田头。进去一看，嗬！母猪呼呼睡，小猪满栏跑，一个个肥头胖耳；五十八间猪舍全部是满圈。几个社员在屋前开挖饲料塘。
    去年，有人建议用大队的一批公共积累，盖办公室和食堂，买扩音器，开起会来舒服些，社员在田里劳动，也可以听听唱片。针对这种摆阔气思想的萌生，支部马上组织干部再一次学习了上级关于勤俭办社的指示，最后决定改变了这个计划，把盖房子、买扩音器的钱盖了五十八间简易猪舍，办起了大队的生猪繁殖场。另外，还盖了十五间房子，八间当食堂，七间给房屋破旧的贫农社员住，这样一来，社员个个说好。
    这个大队两千多亩稻田已经可以实行机械灌溉了，但还看到一些牛拉水车在灌水。他们是这样打算的：秋收秋种前，耕牛闲着没事，让它们轮流戽水，可以灌溉六百多亩田，不但节省了生产费用，还减少了国家的柴油供应。今年这个大队在抽水费、化肥、农药三项生产开支中就比去年节约了五千多元。
    大家都很注意节约，但集体生活福利方面当用的钱，队里也不吝啬。夏天到了，每个食堂的饭桌上都有一个大纱罩。除纱布是买的以外，其余是发动社员利用零碎木料和毛竹自己动手作的，每个纱罩只花了两角多钱。大队还花四百元给食堂买了四台切面机。他们花这笔钱时，也反复算过账，食堂使用切面机，把节省出的劳力用于田间生产，就可以拿到更多的粮食。
    第五小队的牛栏里，拴着一头水牛。饲养员张同生蹲在那里，耐心地把嫩草往牛嘴里送。这头牛已经养了二十年，在别的地方早就要被淘汰了，但在这里饲养员饲养得特别当心，草料一寸三刀，冬天喂温食，夏天喂嫩草。夏忙时，小队长张桂岳亲自使用这头牛，不让受累，结果这头老牛干的活也不少于壮牛。爱护耕畜，这是金丰大队的优良风气，自互助合作以来，没有死过一头牛，全大队耕牛头头都养得膘肥力壮。
  家底愈来愈厚　生活愈过愈好
    这里的人们对粮食更是视如珍宝。夏收后，第五小队已经把打下的麦子送到大队去了，小队长张桂岳发现麦穗上还有麦粒没打净，他又发动群众复晒复打，又打出八十多斤麦子。
    我们在金丰大队吃过好几处食堂，饭的花样多，有干饭、稀饭、面条、菜馄饨。蔬菜也很丰富，一大碗烧豇豆或炒韭菜只要两分钱，一大碗清蒸茄子也只要三分钱。炊事员解释说：收的一点钱是佐料费，实际上蔬菜是免费供应的。每一户社员的饭桌上都摆了好几种饭食和好几大碗蔬菜，大人和孩子们吃得都很香。大队的同志算了一笔账：全大队利用十边隙地种了瓜菜一百二十多亩，食堂菜地也种了大量瓜菜。这些瓜菜和粮食搭配起来吃，调剂了口味，改善了生活，每人每月还可以节省几斤粮食。他们由于精打细算，吃得好又吃得省，粮食储备不断增加。现在，新麦和新稻已经吃到嘴了，大队的仓库里还堆着陈稻。
    金丰大队的干部和社员长期坚持勤俭办社方针，取得了非常好的结果。去年大队管理费只占总收入的0.18％，今年还要继续下降。他们深深懂得以丰补歉、节约防荒的重要性，没有满足于一个大队的富裕，而是关心整个公社、整个国家。他们卖给国家的粮食一年比一年多，向国家的贷款一年比一年少。1958年贷款八千多元，去年只贷了两千多元，今年不仅没向国家贷款，还有九千多元存在国家银行里。
