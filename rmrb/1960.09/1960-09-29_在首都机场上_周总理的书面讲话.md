Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the Capital Airport to welcome Prime Minister U Nu is as follows:

　　Respected Prime Minister U Nu, Respected Burmese guests, Friends, Comrades:

　　We are very excited and pleased to welcome Prime Minister U Nu and his wife, as well as more than 300 distinguished Burmese guests, to our capital, Beijing. Yesterday, we welcomed General Ne Win and his wife. Prime Minister U Nu and General Ne Win have both visited our country and are friends familiar and respected by the Chinese people. Now, they have brought the kinship of the Burmese people to our people, which makes us feel particularly close. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I extend my sincerest respect and warmest welcome to the Burmese guests.

　　China and Burma are not only close neighbors but also relatives. The people of both countries share a common desire to safeguard peace and enhance friendship between the two countries. We jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and the friendly relations between our two countries have been developing and consolidating on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Our two peoples have forged a deep friendship in the common struggle against colonialism and have become very familiar friends. I also remember that Prime Minister U Nu once said: "True friends and neighbors always gather together during festivals." Yes, the leaders of our two countries have often gathered together during festivals. This year, General Ne Win celebrated the Chinese Spring Festival with us in Beijing, and Vice Premier Chen Yi and I celebrated the Burmese Water Splashing Festival in Rangoon. Today, Prime Minister U Nu, General Ne Win, and more than 300 distinguished Burmese guests have come to Beijing to celebrate our National Day with the Chinese people and will participate in the historic signing ceremony of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. The Chinese people are particularly happy.

　　We firmly believe that through the friendly visit of Prime Minister U Nu and other Burmese guests to our country and the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, will achieve even greater development on a new basis and will make new contributions to consolidating peace in Asia and the world. Please allow me to once again extend a warm welcome to you!

　　Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!

　　周总理的书面讲话
　  新华社28日讯　周恩来总理在首都机场欢迎吴努总理的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的吴努总理阁下，尊敬的缅甸贵宾们，朋友们，同志们：
  我们怀着非常兴奋和愉快的心情，欢迎吴努总理阁下和他的夫人以及三百多位缅甸贵宾们光临我国的首都北京。昨天，我们欢迎了奈温将军阁下和他的夫人。吴努总理阁下，奈温将军阁下，都曾经访问过我们的国家，是中国人民所熟悉和尊敬的朋友。现在，他们又给我国人民带来了缅甸人民亲戚般的情谊，使我们感到分外亲切。我代表中国政府和人民向缅甸贵宾们表示最诚挚的敬意和最热烈的欢迎。
    中缅两国不但是近邻，而且是亲戚。两国人民有着维护和平和增进两国友谊的共同愿望。我们共同倡导了和平共处五项原则，我们两国的友好关系，在和平共处五项原则的基础上，日益发展和巩固。我们两国人民在反对殖民主义的共同斗争中，结成了深厚的友谊，成为很熟悉的朋友。我还记得，吴努总理阁下曾经说过：“真正的朋友和邻居在节日的时候总是要聚会在一起的。”是的，我们两国领导人曾多次在节日欢聚在一起。今年，奈温将军阁下在北京同我们一起欢度了中国的春节，我和陈毅副总理在仰光欢度了缅甸的泼水节。今天，吴努总理阁下、奈温将军阁下和三百多位缅甸贵宾们前来北京同中国人民一起欢度我国的国庆节，并且将参加有历史意义的中缅边界条约的签字盛典。中国人民感到格外的高兴。
    我们深信，通过吴努总理阁下和其他缅甸贵宾们对我国的友好访问和中缅边界条约的签订，我们两国以和平共处五项原则为基础的友好合作关系，必将在新的基础上获得更加巨大的发展，并且将为巩固亚洲和世界和平作出新的贡献。请让我再一次向你们表示热烈的欢迎！
    中缅友好万岁！
