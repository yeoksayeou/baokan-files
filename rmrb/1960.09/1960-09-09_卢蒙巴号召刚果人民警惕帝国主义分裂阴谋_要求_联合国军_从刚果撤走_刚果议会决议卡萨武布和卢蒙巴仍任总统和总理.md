Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, 7th – Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba wrote to the UN Special Representative in the Congo, Mr. Dayal, protesting the UN authorities' closure of Congolese airports and the Congolese national radio station, and demanding the withdrawal of "UN forces" from airports and radio stations.

The letter stated: "I remind you that this letter I am writing to you today is to demand clarification of the actions of the UN forces, who occupied various airports on the territory of a country without the permission of the (Congolese) Republic."

"Furthermore, I have just learned that, in addition to this infringement of the territorial sovereignty of the Congolese Republic, you have, under the same circumstances, not only prohibited people from entering the broadcasting studios of our national radio station, but also occupied the equipment of the national radio station."

The letter stated: "Even our General (Lundula), returning from an inspection in the interior, was forbidden to land at (the capital) N'djili Airport and was forced to fly back, which involved various dangers. You will agree with me that the government of the Republic can no longer tolerate these measures."

In the letter, Prime Minister Lumumba demanded: 1. The "UN forces" withdraw from all the airports they have occupied; 2. Return the national radio station equipment to the Congolese people for their use.

Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, 7th – Congolese Minister of Information Kashamura announced to the press here today that the Congolese government had sent a delegation, including Deputy Prime Minister Gizenga, to "UN Headquarters" here to protest the "UN forces," manipulated by the United States, for forcibly occupying the Congolese national radio station.

The minister said that the facts prove that certain countries are plotting against the Congolese government under the guise of the United Nations. He said that the Congolese government will never allow the United Nations to interfere in the Congo's internal affairs.

The minister also said that if the UN authorities do not accept their demand to open the Congolese national radio station, they will appeal to the Security Council.

As everyone knows, while occupying the Congolese national radio station, the "UN forces" also closed Congolese airports under the pretext of "security." It is revealed that the "UN forces'" action was intended to prevent the Congolese government from transporting reinforcements to suppress the Tshombe secessionist group in Katanga and the Kalonji secessionist group in Kasai.

However, according to reports from Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga province, a plane carrying nine tons of weapons for the Tshombe group arrived at Elisabethville Airport from Belgium today without interference from the "UN forces." A spokesman for the Tshombe group revealed that these weapons are only part of the weapons airlifted to the group from Belgium.

According to Western news agencies, "UN forces" in Leopoldville today attempted to prevent Congolese Prime Minister and Member of Parliament Lumumba from entering the Palais du Peuple to attend a parliamentary meeting being held there. At the same time, "UN forces" also entered the parliament hall where the meeting was being held without authorization, and were driven out of the parliament building by Congolese Speaker of the House Kasongo. The speaker angrily said, "We cannot tolerate foreign troops in parliament."

Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, 7th – The Congolese Parliament passed a resolution today stating that President Kasavubu's decision to dismiss Prime Minister Lumumba and his government, as well as the Congolese Council of Ministers' decision to dismiss President Kasavubu, are both invalid.

The parliament also decided to establish a committee consisting of parliamentarians and cabinet members to study these decisions and propose solutions to this problem.

The resolution passed by parliament today was proposed by government members for the sake of unity. Prime Minister Lumumba and cabinet ministers voted in favor of the resolution. After the resolution was passed, Kasavubu and Lumumba remained president and prime minister respectively.

Prime Minister Lumumba said in parliament that the imperialists are trying every possible means to benefit from our mistakes and disunity. He emphasized that imperialism is still very vicious. The situation in the Congo is still very serious. The whole country should unite in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism.

In his speech, Lumumba strongly condemned the United Nations and demanded that "UN forces" withdraw from the Congo. Lumumba also accused the "UN forces" of depriving the Congo of its independence. He charged that the imperialist conspiracy is to overthrow him, create anarchy, and divide the country so as to place it under UN trusteeship. He also condemned the United Nations for illegally closing the Congo's capital, Leopoldville's airport and the Congo's national radio station, disregarding the sovereignty of the Congolese Republic.

In his speech, Prime Minister Lumumba called on the Congolese people to remain vigilant and be wary of imperialist conspiracies to create disunity in the Congo.

He criticized President Kasavubu for many actions that violated the national interest. In criticizing President Kasavubu's views, he firmly believed that military action should be used to eliminate the puppet regimes in Katanga and Kasai. He said that these traitors are fully supported by colonialism and imperialism, which are attempting to divide and enslave the Congo.

Lumumba said, "We asked the United Nations to give us weapons and other material assistance to defend our country, but the United Nations answered 'no.' But, on the contrary, the traitors Tshombe and Kalonji are getting everything we need, including weapons, radios and planes."

    卢蒙巴号召刚果人民警惕帝国主义分裂阴谋
    要求“联合国军”从刚果撤走
    刚果议会决议卡萨武布和卢蒙巴仍任总统和总理
    新华社利奥波德维尔7日电  刚果总理卢蒙巴写信给联合国驻刚果特派代表达雅尔，抗议联合国当局封闭刚果各机场和刚果国家电台，并要求“联合国军”撤出机场和电台。
    信中说：“我提醒您，我今天写给您的这封信是要求澄清联合国军的行动，他们没有得到（刚果）共和国的允许就占领了在一个国家领土上的各个机场。”
      “另外，我刚刚获悉，除了这种侵犯刚果共和国的领土主权的行为以外，您在同一情况下，不但禁止了人们进入我们国家电台的播音室，而且占领了国家电台的设备。”
    信中说：“甚至，我们的（伦杜拉）将军从内地视察回来，竟然被禁止在（首都）恩吉利机场降落，而被迫飞回去，而这样是有各种危险的。您将同意我的看法，即共和国政府再也不能容忍这些措施。”
    卢蒙巴总理在信中要求：一、“联合国军”撤出它所占领的一切飞机场；二、把国家电台设备还给刚果人民使用。
    新华社利奥波德维尔7日电刚果新闻部长卡沙谬拉今天在这里向报界宣布，刚果政府曾经派遣包括副总理基赞加在内的一个代表团前往在这里的“联合国总部”，抗议美国操纵下的“联合国军”强占刚果国家电台。
    这位部长说，事实证明，某些国家在联合国幌子下策划反对刚果政府的勾当。他说，刚果政府决不允许联合国干涉刚果内政。
    这位部长还说，如果联合国当局不接受他们开放刚果国家电台的要求，他们将向安全理事会呼吁。
    大家知道，“联合国军”在占领刚果国家电台的同时，还以“安全”为借口封锁了刚果各机场。据透露，“联合国军”的这一行动是想阻止刚果政府运送增援部队去讨伐加丹加的冲伯分裂集团和开赛省的卡隆吉分裂集团。
    但是，据来自加丹加省省会伊利沙伯维尔的消息说，一架装载着供给冲伯集团的九吨武器的飞机今天从比利时到达伊利沙伯维尔机场，没有受到“联合国军”的干预，据冲伯集团的一个发言人透露，这些武器还只是从比利时空运给这个集团的武器的一部分。
    据西方通讯社报道，在利奥波德维尔的“联合国军”今天曾企图阻止刚果总理、众议员卢蒙巴进入民族宫去参加在那里举行的议会会议。同时，“联合国军”还擅自进入正在开会的议会会场，结果被刚果众议院议长卡松戈赶出了议会大厦。这位议长愤怒地说，“我们不能容忍在议会里有外国军队。”
    新华社利奥波德维尔7日电刚果议会今天通过决议，认为卡萨武布总统宣布解除卢蒙巴总理和他的政府的职务的决定以及刚果部长会议宣布解除卡萨武布的总统职务的决定都是无效的。
    议会还决定由议会议员和内阁阁员成立一个委员会来研究这些决定和提出解决这个问题的办法。
    今天议会通过的决议是政府议员为了团结的意义而提出来的。卢蒙巴总理和内阁部长投票赞成这项决议。在决议通过以后，卡萨武布和卢蒙巴仍然分别担任总统和总理。
    卢蒙巴总理在议会中讲话时说，帝国主义者千方百计地想从我们的错误和不团结中得到好处。他强调指出，帝国主义仍然很凶恶。刚果的局势还很严重。全国在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中应该团结一致。
    卢蒙巴在讲话中强烈谴责联合国，并且要“联合国军”部队撤出刚果。卢蒙巴还指责“联合国军”正在剥夺刚果的独立。他指责说，帝国主义阴谋要推翻他，制造无政府状态，使国家四分五裂，以便把它交给联合国托管。他还谴责联合国不顾刚果共和国的主权非法封闭刚果首都利奥波德维尔的机场和刚果的国家电台。
    卢蒙巴总理在讲话中号召刚果人民保持警惕，小心提防帝国主义在刚果制造不团结的阴谋。
    他批评卡萨武布总统的许多行动是违反国家利益的。他在批评卡萨武布总统的观点时坚决认为，应该用军事行动来消灭加丹加和开赛的傀儡政权。他说，这些叛国分子得到企图分裂和奴役刚果的殖民主义和帝国主义的充分支持。
    卢蒙巴说，“我们要求联合国给予我们武器和其他物质援助来保卫我们的国家，联合国却回答说‘不给’。但是，相反地，叛国分子冲伯和卡隆吉却得到我们所需要的一切东西，包括武器、电台和飞机。”
