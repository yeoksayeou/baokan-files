Xinhua News Agency, September 28th - The full text of Premier U Nu's speech at the banquet hosted by Premier Zhou Enlai is as follows:

	Your Excellency Respected Premier Zhou Enlai, Madame Deng Yingchao, Friends,

	On behalf of all members of our delegation, General Ne Win, and in my own name, I would like to express my gratitude to Your Excellency and Madame for this grand and most sumptuous banquet you have hosted for us tonight.

	Your Excellency and other Chinese friends know that this is not my first friendly visit to China. I can still recall with great pleasure my previous visits, during which I made many friends, and now I eagerly look forward to not only renewing old friendships but also making new ones. Please allow me to take this opportunity to extend my warmest greetings to all these friends.

	Today, as I arrived in your most beautiful and lovely city with its great traditions—a city whose rapid development cannot but leave a deep impression—I was deeply moved by the warm friendship expressed by the people and leaders of the People's Republic of China.

	Many of us are visiting China for the first time, and many have visited China more than once. But for all of us, this is not a foreign land, nor a foreign people. Because deep in our hearts, we have the feelings of relatives, which can be expressed by the word "Paukphaw." Whenever we come to China, it feels like coming home. The traditional hospitality of the Chinese people truly makes one feel at ease.

	Your Excellency, we are also very pleased that our visit is on the eve of the 11th anniversary of your National Day, and all of China is now filled with a festive atmosphere. It is indeed a pleasant and honorable thing to share your joy and be with you and the Chinese people on such a happy and auspicious day. I would like to extend my most sincere and heartfelt congratulations to you, and through you to the government and people of the People's Republic of China, on behalf of the government and people of the Union of Burma.

	Your Excellency, our two countries have maintained a pleasant and sincere relationship throughout history. Since independence, our two countries have sincerely and unswervingly strived to further promote and consolidate this relationship. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, which we two had the honor of jointly initiating, have undoubtedly provided a new, better, and more solid foundation for strengthening and developing this fraternal friendship. In my personal experience, I believe that one of the most positive and satisfying results of adhering to and faithfully applying these principles is the elimination of bad things such as doubts, suspicions, and conjectures, and the development of a spirit of cooperation between the two countries.

	I can list many examples of our friendly cooperation and mutual accommodation, but I think the most notable example worth mentioning is that my dear and distinguished friend General Ne Win, during his tenure as Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, not only signed the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression but also signed the Agreement on the Sino-Burmese Boundary Question, which greatly contributed to the final resolution of this issue that had remained unresolved for nearly a century. By completing these, he laid a good and solid foundation for the "Friendship Mansion" that Your Excellency has so aptly mentioned. With the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, I will now be very pleased and honored to cut the ribbon for the opening ceremony of this mansion. Your Excellency, we are particularly grateful to you and the leaders of the People's Republic of China for giving us this unique opportunity to combine the Sino-Burmese Friendship Year with the National Day celebrations of your country. I believe that such a happy and auspicious festival can be combined into one, which is a first in the history of relations between the two countries.

	In concluding this speech, I cannot but pay the highest tribute to all members of the Joint Boundary Committee, which was established in accordance with the Zhou Enlai-Ne Win Agreement on the Boundary Question between the two countries and is responsible for drafting the Burmese-Chinese Boundary Treaty; their infinite loyalty to their duties, and their great efforts and self-sacrifice, enabled so few people to complete such a difficult and magnificent task in such a short period of time; they conducted friendly negotiations in a spirit of mutual understanding and concession, and in particular, maintained and developed the desire of the two governments to conduct sincere cooperation in accordance with the Five Principles.

	It would be an omission if I did not also mention here the generosity and foresight of Your Excellency and other Chinese leaders, who, like us, attach great importance to safeguarding, maintaining, and developing the friendship and national interests of the two peoples. I hope that our spirit of mutual accommodation and friendly cooperation based on the Five Principles will be applied on a larger scale, thereby promoting friendship between all countries and world peace.

	I ask everyone to join me in a toast:

	To the eternal friendship between the peoples of Burma and China,

	To the prosperity of the People's Republic of China and the happiness of its various ethnic groups,

	To the great victory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence,

	To peace in Asia and the world,

	To the health of Your Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai and Madame Deng Yingchao,

	To the health of His Excellency Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the People's Republic of China,

	To the health of His Excellency Chairman Mao Zedong,

	Cheers!

### 在周恩来总理举行的宴会上　吴努总理的讲话

　　在周恩来总理举行的宴会上
　　吴努总理的讲话
    新华社28日讯　吴努总理在周恩来总理举行的宴会上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的周恩来总理先生阁下，邓颖超夫人，朋友们，
    我代表我们代表团的全体成员，奈温将军并以我个人的名义向阁下和夫人表示感谢，感谢你们今晚为我们举行的这个盛大和最丰富的宴会。
    阁下和其他的中国朋友们都知道这并不是我第一次到中国来进行友好访问。我仍然能够非常愉快地回忆起我前几次的访问，那时候我结识了许多朋友，现在我迫切地期待着不仅重叙旧谊并且要结识新的朋友。请允许我借此机会向所有这些朋友们热烈致意。
    今天，当我到达你们最美丽可爱的、有着伟大传统的城市的时候——这个城市的迅速发展不能不给人留下深刻的印象——，中华人民共和国的人民和领导人所表示的热情的友谊使我深受感动。
    我们之中许多人是第一次到中国来，也有不少人不只一次地访问过中国。但是对我们所有的人来说，这不是一个陌生的国土，也不是一个陌生的人民。因为在我们的心坎深处有着谊同亲戚的感情，这种感情可以用“胞波”两字来表达。我们不论什么时候到中国来都好像是回到了家里一样。中国人民传统的殷勤好客也确使人感到心中毫无拘束。
    阁下，我们很高兴也是因为我们的访问是在贵国国庆十一周年庆典的前夕，整个中国现在正洋溢着一种节日的气氛。在这样喜庆吉祥的日子里，分享你们的欢乐，并同你和中国人民在一起，这的确是很愉快和荣幸的事。我谨代表缅甸联邦政府和人民向你，并通过你向中华人民共和国政府和人民致以最真挚的和衷心的祝贺。
    阁下，我们两国在整个历史中一直保持着愉快和真诚的关系。自从独立以来，我们两国真诚地始终不渝地为进一步促进和巩固这种关系而努力。我们两人很荣幸地共同创导的万隆精神和和平共处五项原则，无疑地已经为加强和发展这种兄弟般的友谊提供了新的、更好的、更稳固的基础。以我个人的经验来说，我认为，信守和忠实运用这些原则的最积极、最令人满意的结果之一是消除了疑虑、怀疑和猜疑之类的坏事而代之以两国之间合作精神的发展。
    我可以列举许多我们友好合作和互让的例子，但是我认为值得提出的最显著的例子是我的亲爱的和杰出的朋友奈温将军在他担任缅甸联邦总理的职务期间不仅签订了友好互不侵犯条约，而且还签订了中缅边界问题的协定，这个协定大大有助于这个将近一个世纪以来所未能解决的问题的最后解决。由于完成了以上这些，他为阁下所恰当地提到的“友好大厦”很好地和真正地打下了基础。随着中缅边界条约的签订，现在我将很愉快地和荣幸地为这座大厦的开幕仪式剪彩。阁下，我们特别感谢你和中华人民共和国的领导人给我们把中缅友好年和贵国国庆典礼合并起来的这个独一无二的机会。我认为这样愉快和吉祥的节日能够合而为一，这在两个国家的关系史中还是第一次。
    在结束这个讲话的时候我不能不对根据周恩来—奈温关于两国边界问题的协定而设立的，并且负有起草缅中边界条约的责任的联合边界委员会的全体成员表示崇高的敬意；他们对职责无限忠诚，并且作出了巨大的努力和自我牺牲，使得这么少的人能够在这么短的时间内完成如此困难和宏伟的任务；他们以互谅互让的精神进行了友好谈判，并且特别是根据五项原则，维护和发展了两国政府进行真诚合作的愿望。
    如果我不同时在此提到阁下以及其他中国领导人的慷慨和远见，他们同我们一样，对于保障、维护和发展两国人民的友谊和国家利益都给予极大的重视，那将是一种疏忽。我希望我们基于五项原则的互让精神和友好合作将在更大的范围内得到运用，从而促进各国之间的友谊和世界和平。
    我请求大家同我一起
    为缅中两国人民的永恒的友谊，
    为中华人民共和国的繁荣和它的各族人民的幸福，
    为和平共处五项原则的伟大胜利，
    为亚洲和世界和平，
    为周恩来总理阁下和邓颖超夫人的健康，
    为中华人民共和国主席刘少奇阁下的健康，
    为毛泽东主席阁下的健康，
    干杯！
