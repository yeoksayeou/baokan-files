    Gains on the Front Line
	Xu Shaohua, First Secretary of the CPC Shulu County Committee, Hebei

    The progress of the times inevitably brings many new things and generates many new problems. In order to closely integrate thought with practice, and leadership with the masses, leaders must frequently go deep into the front lines to adapt to the requirements of the new situation. Like many regions, Shulu County has seen great improvements in the work style of leaders at all levels after earnestly promoting Wuqiao County's "two-five system" of leadership.

    The change in leadership style has made the work of leaders at all levels closer to the masses and closer to reality, making guidance in work more timely, accurate, and effective. In June of this year, Comrade Tian Yi, Secretary of the County Party Committee Secretariat, discovered when he went to the Yi Jianfang Production Team that the reason for the slow irrigation was large furrow flooding and uneven land. Therefore, he personally helped the masses change the large furrows to small furrows and leveled the land, making irrigation faster, more even, and more water-saving. Through an on-site meeting, the masses accepted this experience, increasing irrigation from 400 mu to 1,000 mu per day. Comrade Yao Haiqi, Secretary of the Fanjiagang Commune, led the masses to use lights to lure and kill cotton bollworms in the Dongdachen Production Team, which was originally very effective, but the masses were unwilling to promote it. The masses said, "Using lights to lure and kill will attract moths from all over the place, and the number we kill is less than the number we attract." After he discovered this ideological problem, he educated the commune members with collectivist thought, cleared up the masses' thinking, and found a solution. He promoted "light trapping" and concentrated forces to fight a war of annihilation against the cotton bollworms. Such problems, which we have talked about a lot in meetings and documents in the past, have never been resolved very well. Once the leading comrades go deep, the problem is solved thoroughly. Therefore, facts constantly tell us that if leading comrades go down and delve in, and are good at using direct and concrete experiences to educate the masses, all work will achieve twice the result with half the effort.

    Strengthening the front line means moving leadership organs to the fields. This is an improvement in the leadership's deep dive into the front line, developing into a collective deep dive into the front line. Chairman Mao once instructed us: "The basic tasks of the Communist Party's leading organs lie in understanding the situation and grasping policies, the former is what is called understanding the world, and the latter is what is called transforming the world." If we want to understand the world, we must be familiar with the overall situation, have correct analysis and judgment, and then take corresponding correct measures to transform the world. How to become familiar with the overall situation? If we are limited to listening to reports and reading documents, it is not enough. Because in the context of the Great Leap Forward, the situation is changing rapidly, and new situations are often replaced by newer situations by the time they reach the organs. Also, because some problems, although reported to the leading organs in a timely manner, are not deeply felt due to lack of practical experience and on-the-spot observation, they cannot receive the attention they deserve. Now, we move the leading organs to the production team to work and hold meetings, leading cadres live in small teams, eat in the canteen, and face the fields, observing the changes in the situation in a timely manner, living among the commune members. In this way, things that could not be seen, heard, thought of, or touched in the past can all be obtained, and the county party committee can make correct decisions on major issues, thereby effectively leading the work of the entire county. For example, in June of this year, the Standing Committee of the County Party Committee moved to the Hemujing Commune to convene a meeting. They saw that the wheat was about to mature, but it was not yet fully ripe. According to the masses' habits, it would take a few more days to harvest. However, according to the weather forecast, there would be strong winds in the near future. If we did not act early, it would cause great losses. Therefore, we invited several production team branch secretaries and old farmers to participate in our Standing Committee meeting to jointly study the wheat harvesting issue and made a decision: "Cadres lead the team, all lines support, harvest as soon as it is ripe." As soon as the order was issued, the county started a major wheat harvesting campaign, and the County Party Committee also suspended the Standing Committee meetings to participate in the wheat harvesting. After five days of intensive efforts and three days of sweeping up, the wheat harvest was successfully completed.

    In order to strengthen cotton field management, we held a meeting of the County Party Committee Secretariat in Xiaoqiao Commune to summarize the cotton field management experience of Zhoujiazhuang. After looking at the on-site meeting, the 7,000 mu of cotton plants were one and a half feet high, with no missing seedlings, like a mat. Many people praised it and said, "I only heard it was good in the past, but I didn't know it was so good." Everyone expressed their determination to learn from Zhoujiazhuang and catch up with Zhoujiazhuang, and immediately launched a major upsurge in cotton field management throughout the county.

    Due to the improvement of the leadership style of the County Party Committee, the work style of the vast number of cadres in the county has also undergone great changes, and a solid atmosphere of improving the work style of the organs and going deep into the front line has been established. At present, more than 70% of the cadres in the county who are detached from production are often living and fighting on the front line. Offices at the county, commune, district, and production team levels have moved to small teams or fields, set up telephones, and put up tents. A widespread competition movement of going deep into the masses and deep into reality has been launched among the cadres. More than 95% of the 240 brigade cadres in Dongzhuosu Commune have participated in production and led production. This great change in leadership style not only guarantees the continuous development of agricultural production at present, but more importantly, cadres and the masses have further realized the correctness of the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation from practical activities. Because the understanding has been improved, a mass upsurge of all trades and professions consciously supporting the great development of agriculture has been launched. The industrial sector guarantees the timely completion of the repair and manufacture of irrigation and drainage machinery and all agricultural implements with guaranteed quality and quantity; the financial and trade departments have widely carried out the "five help" movement (helping to formulate plans, helping to organize people's economic life, helping to train technical personnel, helping to raise funds, and helping to manage finances), providing a large number of production and living materials and funds for agricultural production. They have also transferred a large number of people to production teams to work as accountants and administrators.

    Due to the improvement of leadership style and leadership methods, and because we have both gone deep into the points and promoted the surface, the relationship between the party and the masses has become closer, and the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members has become greater. This is the victory of the Party's General Line, the victory of the Great Leap Forward, and the victory of the Party's mass line.

### 第一线上的收获

    第一线上的收获	中共河北束鹿县委第一书记　徐少华
    时代的前进，必然带来许多新事物，产生许多新问题。为要使思想和实际，领导和群众紧密结合起来，领导必须经常深入第一线，适应新形势的要求。束鹿县像许多地区一样，在认真推广吴桥县“二五制”的领导方法之后，各级领导作风都有了很大的改进。
    领导作风的改变，使各级领导工作更加接近群众，接近实际，在指导工作上就更及时、更准确、更有力。今年6月间，县委书记处书记田义同志深入一间房生产队时，发现该队浇地慢的原因是大畦漫灌、土地不平整。于是，他亲手帮助群众，把大畦改为小畦，平整了土地，浇起来又快、又匀、又省水。通过现场会，群众接受了这个经验，从日浇四百亩提高到一千亩。范家庄公社书记姚海其同志，到东大陈生产队领导群众晚上用灯光诱杀棉铃虫，本来很有效，但是群众不愿意推广，群众说：“用灯光诱杀，就把各地的蛾子引来了，杀的不如引来的多”。他发现这个思想问题后，用集体主义思想教育社员，使群众思想搞通了，办法出来了，推行了“灯光诱杀”，集中兵力对棉铃虫打了个歼灭战。诸如此类的问题，我们过去无论在会议、文件上讲过很多，但总是解决得不大好。领导同志一深入，问题就解决得彻底了。因此，事实不断告诉我们，领导同志走下来钻进去，善于用直接具体的经验教育群众，什么工作都会取得事半功倍之效。
    加强第一线，领导机关到方田。这是领导人深入第一线发展到集体深入第一线的提高。毛主席曾指示我们：“共产党领导机关的基本任务，就在于了解情况和掌握政策两件大事，前一件事就是所谓认识世界，后一件事就是所谓改造世界。”我们要认识世界，就必须熟悉全面情况，有正确的分析判断，才能相应地采取正确的措施去改造世界。如何熟悉全面情况呢？如果仅仅限于听汇报、看文件，这是不够的。因为在大跃进的情况下，形势瞬息万变，新情况到了机关，往往被更新的情况所代替；又由于有些问题虽然及时地反映到了领导机关，因为没有实际体会，缺乏实地观察，感觉不深，就不能给予应有的注意。现在呢，我们把领导机关搬到生产队办公、开会，领导干部住小队，吃食堂，面对方田，及时观察着情况的变化，生活在社员之中。这样，过去看不到、听不到、想不到、摸不到的东西，都可以得到了，县委就可以在重大问题上作出正确的决策，从而有力地领导全县的工作。例如，今年6月间，县委常委会搬到和睦井公社召开，看到小麦即将成熟，但还不到十成熟，按群众习惯还得几天才能收割。然而，根据气象预报近期有大风，如不早动手，就会造成极大损失。于是，我们就邀请了几个生产队的支部书记、老农参加了我们的常委会，共同研究了收麦问题，并做出决定：“干部带班，各线支援，熟一块收一块”。命令一下，全县开始了麦收大突击，县委也停开常委会议参加了收麦。经过五天大突击，三天扫尾，胜利完成了麦收。
    为了加强棉田管理，我们在小樵公社召开了县委书记处会议，总结了周家庄的棉田管理经验。通过现场会一看，七千亩棉方棵高一尺半，根苗不缺，好像一领席，许多人看了都称赞地说：“过去只听说好，不知这么好。”一致表示要学周家庄、赶周家庄，立即在全县掀起了棉田管理大高潮。
    由于县委领导作风的改进，全县广大干部的作风也有了很大的转变，一个扎扎实实改进机关作风、深入第一线的风气树立起来了。目前全县有70％以上的脱离生产的干部经常生活战斗在第一线。县、社、区、生产队各级办公室搬到了小队或田间，架起了电话，搭起了帐篷。在干部中普遍掀起了深入群众、深入实际的竞赛运动。东卓宿公社二百四十名大队干部95％以上做到了参加生产领导生产。这种领导作风的大转变，不仅在现时保证了农业生产不断向前发展，更重要的是干部和群众从实践活动中已经进一步认识到以农业为基础这一方针的正确性。由于认识提高了，一个千行百业群众性的支援农业大发展的高潮自觉地开展起来了。工业部门保证按质按量及时完成排灌机械和一切农具的修配制造；财贸部门广泛开展了“五帮”运动（帮制定计划，帮组织人民经济生活，帮训练技术人员，帮筹措资金，帮管好财务），为农业生产提供了大批生产、生活资料和资金。并抽调了大批人员到生产队当会计和管理员。
    由于领导作风和领导方法的改进，由于既深入了点，又推动了面，党和群众的关系更加密切了，广大社员群众的干劲更大了。这是党的总路线的胜利，大跃进的胜利和党的群众路线的胜利。
