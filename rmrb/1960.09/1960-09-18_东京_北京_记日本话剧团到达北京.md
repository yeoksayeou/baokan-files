    Tokyo—Beijing
    —A Record of the Japanese Theater Troupe's Arrival in Beijing By Our Correspondent Zhu Shulan
    "Our Asian compatriots, brothers and sisters,
    Light torches, light the way, throughout Asia.
    Though the wind and rain rage fiercely, we will not bow our heads.
    Let our enthusiasm be like fire, bravely moving forward.
    Our friendship is noble, beautiful, and loyal,
    From Tokyo to Beijing, shoulder to shoulder,
    Through selfless friendship, united tightly with the people of the world,
    Fearing no hardship or obstacle, hand in hand our strength is even stronger,
    This is the symbol of friendship: Tokyo Beijing Tokyo Beijing."
    On September 16th, a parade holding flowers appeared on the streets of Beijing, singing with great enthusiasm the song "Tokyo—Beijing," which is very dear and beloved by the Chinese people. Every time we hear this song, we are reminded of the massive parades in front of the Tokyo Diet Building, where the Japanese people resolutely opposed the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and the scenes of persecution they suffered at the hands of the American imperialists' lackeys—gunshots, bayonets, water cannons... And this group from Tokyo, representing the millions upon millions of Japanese people who oppose American imperialist aggression—the Japanese Theater Troupe—upon arriving in Beijing, staged a demonstration against American imperialist aggression as they walked from the train station to their residence. Demonstrating against the U.S. in the capital of People's China, they didn't have to worry about bayonets or water cannons; they held flowers in their hands, and before them lay the peaceful and prosperous streets of Beijing. On the wide avenue, welcoming these comrades-in-arms were members of Chinese literary and art circles; cheering from the sidewalks were Beijing residents who support the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle; and maintaining order, ensuring the smooth passage of the Japanese friends' parade, were the Chinese People's Police. At the head of the parade was our common battle cry: "Oppose the Japan-U.S. Military Alliance Treaty," "Oppose American Imperialist Aggression, Defend World Peace." Wherever they went, they were met with the warm, comradely cheers of the Chinese people.
    The Japanese Theater Troupe is not only a messenger of the vast Japanese theatrical community, united under the common goal of opposing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"; it is also a cultural envoy of the Japanese people who, in just a year and a half, have carried out twenty-two magnificent national unified actions and achieved great victories. The Japanese people's heroic struggle has given the Chinese people great encouragement and support. The banner held high at the front of the Japanese Theater Troupe's parade, "Long Live the Solidarity of the Chinese and Japanese People," moved the Chinese literary and art circles and the masses on the roadside who welcomed the distinguished guests, and they joined the procession, advancing shoulder to shoulder with the Japanese friends; from Tokyo to Beijing, the ranks of the anti-American struggle grew longer and longer, forming an irresistible powerful torrent. Just like the inspiring slogan written on the huge cartoon held high in the welcoming procession, symbolizing the two peoples' two anti-American fighters holding hands, which terrified the American imperialists: "Our Common Enemy is American Imperialism." The mutual support of the Chinese and Japanese people will surely be able to defeat the enemy.
    Listen, in the midst of the Chinese people's cheers of "Warmly Welcome the Japanese Theater Troupe" and "Celebrate the Victory of the Japanese People's Anti-American Patriotic Struggle," the Japanese friends sang another battle-rousing song:
        It is time to stand up,
        Now is the crucial moment,
        For the future of our children,
        Before the fires of evil start to burn,
        Quickly stamp them out,
        Arise, arise, arise, arise!
    They sang in Japanese, and we don't understand all of it. But what does it matter? This is the true voice of the Japanese people. From this impassioned song, we can feel the Japanese people's incomparable pain and rebellious mood today under the iron heel of American imperialist aggression and the oppression of Japanese militarism. For a hundred years, the Chinese people have suffered deeply from the devastation and trampling of imperialism and reactionary rule. Look, those gray-haired Chinese literary and art warriors marching shoulder to shoulder with the Japanese friends, isn't their fighting life the most powerful proof! Now, the Chinese people have stood up, and the Japanese people will surely stand up too. We have many common languages.
        Let us all advance together,
        The "silent people" roar.
        Let us all advance together,
        Happiness is defended by our hands.
        Let us all advance together,
        The whole of Japan is united as one,
        Marching bravely forward.
    The song "Let Us All Advance Together" flies from the skies of Tokyo to the skies of Beijing, and this song will also fly to Africa, Latin America, to every corner of the world.
    The Japanese Theater Troupe arrived in the capital of China in this atmosphere of enthusiastic singing. Before seeing the Japanese friends' first performance, the audiences in the capital of China had already heard their heartfelt voices deeply and excitedly, and breathed together with them.

    东京——北京
    ——记日本话剧团到达北京	本报记者　朱树兰
    “我们亚洲的同胞们，兄弟姐妹们，
    在全亚洲燃起火炬，燃起光明。
    狂风暴雨虽然猛烈，我们不低头。
    让我们热情像火一般，勇敢向前。
    我们友谊高贵美丽忠诚，
    东京直到北京肩并肩，
    通过无私的友情，和全世界人民团结紧，
    不怕任何艰难困苦阻挡，手拉手儿力量更坚强，
    这是友谊的标志：东京北京东京北京。”
    9月16日的北京街头，出现了一支手捧着鲜花的游行队伍，他们充满热情地高声唱着《东京——北京》这首中国人民非常亲切和热爱的歌曲。每当我们听到这首歌，总会想起东京议会大厦前，日本人民坚决反对日美“安全条约”的广大游行队伍，和他们受到美帝国主义奴仆们枪杀、刺刀、水龙头……迫害的情景。而这一支从东京来的，代表着千千万万反对美帝国主义侵略的日本人民的文化使者——日本话剧团到达北京后，从车站步行到住处的时候，进行了反对美帝国主义侵略的游行示威。在人民中国的首都反美游行示威，他们用不着担心什么刺刀、水龙头，他们手里是鲜花，眼前是一片和平和繁荣的北京街道。在宽阔的大道上，迎接战友的是中国文艺界人士；夹道欢呼的是支持日本人民反美爱国斗争的北京居民；维持秩序、让日本朋友的游行队伍顺利通过的，是中国人民警察。在游行队伍的前列，是我们共同的战斗目标：“反对日美军事同盟条约”、“反对美帝国主义侵略，保卫世界和平”。他们走到哪里，哪里就响起了中国人民热诚的、战友般的欢呼。
    日本话剧团不仅是团结在反对日美“安全条约”共同目标下的日本广大戏剧界的使者；也是短短的一年半时间，进行了二十二次波澜壮阔的全国统一行动，获得了伟大胜利的日本人民的文化使者。日本人民的英勇斗争，给了中国人民很大的鼓励和支持。高擎在日本话剧团游行队伍前列的“日中两国人民的团结万岁”的旗帜，激动了欢迎贵宾的中国文艺界和路旁的群众，他们参加到队伍里来了，和日本朋友肩并肩地前进；从东京到北京，反美斗争的行列愈来愈长，形成了一道坚不可挡的强大巨流。就像欢迎的行列中高举的，象征两国人民的两个反美战士手挽手，使美帝国主义者吓破了胆的巨幅漫画上写着的、振奋人心的警句：“我们的共同敌人是美帝国主义”。中日两国人民的相互支持一定能够战胜敌人。
    你听，在中国人民“热烈欢迎日本话剧团”、“庆贺日本人民反美爱国斗争的胜利”欢呼声中，日本朋友又唱起了一支鼓舞斗志的歌：
        是站起来的时候了，
        现在到了紧要关头，
        为了孩子们的未来，
        趁着邪恶之火尚未燃烧，
        就快快把它踏灭，
        起来，起来，起来吧，起来吧！
    他们是用日本语言唱的，我们不全听得懂。但是，这又有什么关系呢？这是真正的日本人民的心声。从这激愤的歌声里，我们能够体会到日本人民今天在美帝国主义侵略的铁蹄和日本军国主义压榨下的无比痛苦和反抗心情。百年来，中国人民深受帝国主义和反动统治的摧残蹂躏。你看，那些和日本朋友并肩前进的、白发苍苍的中国文艺战士的战斗的一生，难道不是最有力的证明！如今，中国人民站起来了，日本人民一定也会站起来。我们是有许多共同的语言的。
        大家一道前进，
        “无声的人民”发出吼声。
        大家一道前进，
        幸福靠我们双手捍卫。
        大家一道前进，
        整个日本万众一心，
        奋勇前进。
    “大家一道前进”的歌声，从东京上空飞扬到北京上空，这歌声还会飞扬到非洲、拉丁美洲，到全世界的每一个角落。
    日本话剧团就在这慷慨高歌的气氛中来到中国的首都。中国的首都的观众们，在看到日本朋友的第一场演出之前，就已经十分深刻而又十分激动地听到他们的心声，并且同他们共呼吸了。
