Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1's Open Hearth Furnace Workshop Humbly Learns from Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3's Advanced Experience
Visited Six Times to Obtain Steelmaking "Secrets"
Put Politics in Command; Arouse the Masses; Strengthen Coordination; Average Daily Steel Production Increases Significantly

(According to a *Jiefang Daily* report) The workers of the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant have been humbly learning from the advanced and working hard to catch up. They have crossed the Huangpu River several times to learn from the advanced experience of the No. 1 pig iron furnace in the No. 2 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, and the production outlook has undergone significant changes. The melting rate per hour of the pig iron furnace has increased by 20%, and the average daily steel production from August 1st to 25th has increased by 42.8% compared with the same period last month.

This workshop is one of the most poorly equipped among the steelmaking workshops in Shanghai. After changing the acidic lining of the pig iron furnace to alkaline last year, new problems arose in steelmaking production: the melting speed of pig iron was slow, and the twelve-ton pig iron furnace could only produce about ten tons of molten iron per hour. Although the leading cadres were very anxious, they did not look for the reasons subjectively and rely on the masses of workers to solve the problems. Ideologically, they believed that the main reason was "poor equipment conditions." In July of this year, the No. 1 pig iron furnace in the No. 2 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant was rated as an advanced unit in the city's large open hearth furnace workshop evaluation. They went to the No. 2 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of the No. 3 Steel Plant for the first time to "learn and see" with the attitude of "let's learn and see." This time, they only saw that the style of the No. 1 pig iron furnace in the No. 2 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of the No. 3 Steel Plant was good and the stockyard was wide. After returning to the plant, they took advantage of the overhaul period to modify the style of the pig iron furnace to be exactly the same. The second time, the workshop sent cadres and workers to cross the river to "learn from experience," learning technical operation experience. After these two studies, the problem was still not resolved, and the iron melting speed was still slow. Later, they went to the No. 3 Steel Plant to study twice again, but production still did not improve much. It was not until the No. 1 pig iron furnace became a city-wide high-yield and high-quality pacesetter, and the experience of "politics on the furnace front" was introduced, that they realized that what they had learned in the past was not correct. When the representatives of the No. 1 pig iron furnace introduced to them the advanced experience of communist collaboration, everyone felt that it touched their hearts. The workshop leading cadres said: "In the past, the difficulties we suffered were not due to poor equipment conditions, but to the failure to put politics in command and not follow the mass line." The entire workshop, from top to bottom, found the key to changing the production outlook and clarified the direction of improving production. After a period of brainstorming, they realized that the decisive factor in improving production was people, not things. So, they regrouped and crossed the river for the fifth time to "learn from experience." All the workers worked alongside the workers in the No. 3 Steel Plant, learning "one-on-one": the furnace chief to the furnace chief, the charging worker to the charging worker. After two days and two nights of earnest and practical learning and rambling talks, the workers gained rich harvests, and also suggested that workshop directors, duty supervisors, and other cadres cross the river for the sixth time to learn the spirit of unity between cadres and the masses of the No. 1 pig iron furnace.

After six studies, the workshop leading cadres improved their leadership style and worked together with the workers on the production front line. On August 15, 1958, Shanghai newspapers published a newsletter entitled "Steel Must Be Refined, and People Must Also Be Refined," introducing the experience of the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant as one of the eight red flags on Shanghai's industrial front. On this day this year, the workshop reprinted and distributed that newsletter to every worker. The workers were deeply moved when they reread the newsletter. Some old workers recalled in their discussions that their workshop was one of the "eight red flags" on Shanghai's industrial front, but now it had fallen behind the No. 3 Steel Plant, and expressed that they must learn from the No. 3 Steel Plant and catch up with the No. 3 Steel Plant, so that the old red flag would shine brightly. The pig iron furnace workers said: "If the comrades of the No. 3 Steel Plant can do it, why can't we?"

With politics in command, a situation of mutual encouragement and hard work emerged in the entire workshop. The communist ideology of the masses of workers was further developed, and everyone took the initiative to strengthen collaboration and cooperation to solve production problems. The charging workers closely contacted the furnace workers. As soon as they heard that the sulfur content of the molten iron was high, they immediately came back to check whether there was a problem with the mixing of the flux; as soon as they heard that the vent on the furnace was blocked, they immediately checked whether there was ash powder in the lime and coke, and whether the materials were added evenly. They said: "When we cook at home, if the quantity and order of oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar are not properly matched, the dishes will definitely not taste good. Charging is like cooking. If various materials are added randomly, not only will good molten iron not be produced, but the pot will also be damaged. We charging workers must be good cooks." From all directions, everyone worked for the pig iron furnace and fought for steel. The mental outlook of the people has changed, and the production outlook of the entire workshop has also changed rapidly. The melting speed and desulfurization effect of the pig iron furnace have been greatly improved, thereby promoting the continuous increase in the daily output of converter steel.

### 上钢一厂第一转炉车间虚心学习上钢三厂先进经验  六次登门造访取得炼钢“真经”  政治挂帅  群情奋发  协作加强  钢的平均日产量显著增长

    上钢一厂第一转炉车间虚心学习上钢三厂先进经验
    六次登门造访取得炼钢“真经”
    政治挂帅  群情奋发  协作加强  钢的平均日产量显著增长
      据解放日报消息　上海第一钢铁厂第一转炉车间的职工，虚心学先进，发奋赶先进，几次过黄浦江到上钢三厂第二转炉车间学习这个车间一号化铁炉的先进经验，生产面貌起了显著变化。化铁炉的每小时熔化率提高了20％，8月1日到25日钢的平均日产量，比上月同期提高了42.8％。
    这个车间是上海市各炼钢车间中设备较差的一个，去年把化铁炉的酸性炉衬改为碱性之后，炼钢生产上出现了新的问题：化铁熔化速度慢，十二吨的化铁炉一小时只能出十吨左右的铁水。领导干部虽然很急，却没有从主观上去找原因，依靠工人群众去解决问题，思想上认为主要原因是“设备条件不好”。今年7月间，上钢三厂第二转炉车间一号化铁炉在全市大型转炉车间评比中，被评为先进单位。他们抱着“学学看”的态度，第一次渡江去三厂第二转炉车间“取经”。这一次学习只看到三厂二转炉车间一号化铁炉的式样好，料场宽，回厂后，就趁大修期间把化铁炉的式样改得一模一样。第二次，这个车间又派了干部和工人渡江“取经”，学习了技术操作经验。经过这两次学习，问题仍然没有解决，铁水熔化速度还是慢。后来他们又两次到三厂去学习，生产仍然没有多大起色。直到一号化铁炉成为全市高产优质的标兵，“政治上炉前”的经验被介绍以后，他们才知道过去学的不对头。当一号化铁炉的代表向他们介绍共产主义大协作的先进经验时，大家都感到说到了他们心里。车间领导干部说：“过去我们苦头不是吃在设备条件不好上，而是吃在政治不挂帅、不走群众路线上。”全车间从上到下找到了改变生产面貌的关键，明确了提高生产的方向。他们经过一番务虚，认识到提高生产的决定因素是人，不是物。于是重整旗鼓，五次渡江“取经”。所有的工人都在三厂跟班劳动，“一对一”对口学习：炉长对炉长，加料工对加料工。经过两天两夜认真、踏实的学习和漫谈，工人得到了丰富的收获，还建议工长、值班主任等干部六次过江，去学习一号化铁炉干群一致的精神。
    经过六次学习，车间领导干部改进了领导作风，在生产第一线同工人一起攻关。1958年8月15日，上海各报曾发表“钢要炼，人也要炼”的通讯，介绍上钢一厂第一转炉车间成为上海工业战线八面红旗之一的经验。今年这一天，车间里把那篇通讯重新加以翻印，分发给每一个工人。工人们重读了这篇通讯，大为感动。有些老工人在议论中，回忆起自己车间是上海工业战线的“八面红旗”之一，现在落在三厂后面了，表示一定要学三厂、赶三厂，叫老红旗大放光彩。化铁炉工人说：“三厂同志能做到的，我们为什么不能做到？”
    政治一挂帅，全车间出现了相互激励，发奋图强的局面。工人群众的共产主义思想更加发扬了，大家主动加强协作和配合，解决生产上的问题。加料工人同炉前工人密切联系，一听说铁水硫高，马上回来检查熔剂配搭是否有问题；一听说炉子上有风眼堵塞，马上检查石灰、焦炭是否有灰粉，料加的是否均匀。他们说：“我们家里烧小菜，油盐酱醋的数量和先后次序如果搭配不当，烧出的菜一定不好吃。加料就好比烧小菜，各种料如果乱加，不仅出不了好铁水，而且锅子也要烧坏。我们加料工人一定要当一名好厨师。”四面八方，人人为化铁炉出力，人人为钢而战。人的精神面貌发生了变化，整个车间的生产面貌也迅速变化，化铁炉的熔化速度和去硫效果都大大提高，从而促进了转炉钢日产量的节节上升。
