    Worker Ranks Gradually Grow; Political and Technical Levels Continuously Improve
    Mongolian Industrial Production Grows Annually
    Broad Masses of Youth Play a Significant Role in Production and Construction
    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 16th – According to a recent report in the Mongolian “Unen” (Truth) newspaper, the ranks of Mongolian workers are gradually growing and playing a major role in the development of Mongolia's national industry.
    Currently, the number of Mongolian workers and staff has reached 132,000. The number of workers has not only increased quantitatively, but has also undergone qualitative changes, with their political, cultural, and technical levels also rising. In many new factories that have recently commenced production, the number of workers with a high school education is constantly increasing.
    "Unen" pointed out that Mongolia's national industry has become an independent sector of the national economy. During the First Five-Year Plan period, industrial production increased by an average of 2.4% annually. During the Second Five-Year Plan, the average annual growth rate reached 13.1%. The industrial production plans for the first two years of the Three-Year Plan have been completed on schedule, and industrial production in the first half of this year increased by 21.2% compared to the same period last year.
    Mongolian workers practice thrift and economy, put forward many inventions and innovations and rationalization proposals in production, save large amounts of funds, and promote the development of socialist industry. In 1959 alone, 3.5 million Tugriks were saved for the state. Young workers in Mongolian industrial enterprises have recently launched a widespread movement to utilize waste products and collect metals. They are guaranteeing to save 30 million Tugriks before the 40th anniversary of the Mongolian Revolution.
    "Unen" said that Mongolia has surpassed countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Burma, Turkey, Iraq, and Libya in terms of industrial development.
    During the Third Five-Year Plan, which begins next year, Mongolian workers will make a greater contribution to the cause of building the material and technical foundations of socialism in the country. Their main task is to further enhance the links between industry and agriculture and animal husbandry, providing production and technical resources for agriculture and animal husbandry.

    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 11th – According to a report in the "Mongolian Youth Truth" newspaper, members of the Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League and young people are playing a significant role in national production and construction.
    According to reports, young people account for more than 70% of Mongolian workers, and they have always been at the forefront of adopting advanced production technologies. The competition to win the title of "Socialist Labor Team" was initiated by Youth League members. Currently, there are fifteen "Socialist Labor Teams" in the country, and five hundred and seventy-six production teams are striving for the title of "Socialist Labor Team," with a total of more than seven thousand team members, the vast majority of whom are young people.
    On the agricultural and pastoral front, Youth League members have made tremendous contributions to the socialist transformation of agriculture and animal husbandry. They were the first to respond to the call of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party to develop agricultural production and meet the needs of the domestic people for flour in recent years, and went to reclamation areas to open up wasteland. In the first year of reclamation (1959), young people reclaimed 40,000 hectares of wasteland. Now crops have grown on these newly reclaimed lands, and the fruits of the youth's labor are about to be harvested. In order to irrigate farmland and pastures, young people have dug more than 1,000 kilometers of canals in provinces such as Bayankhongor and Gobi-Altai, which can be used to irrigate more than 35,000 hectares of land. At the same time, young people in agricultural and pastoral cooperatives are working hard to increase livestock and improve the output of livestock products.
    The broad masses of Mongolian youth have begun to advance towards mastering several technologies. At present, there are already 6,995 young people in the agricultural and animal husbandry sectors who have mastered two specialized technologies, and more than 3,600 young people who have mastered three technologies.
    Since the beginning of this year, young employees have put forward more than 900 inventions, innovations and rationalization proposals, of which 80% have been put into practice.

    工人队伍逐步成长　政治技术不断提高
    蒙古工业生产逐年增长
    广大青年在生产建设中发挥重大作用
    新华社乌兰巴托16日电　据蒙古“真理报”最近报道，蒙古工人队伍正在逐步成长，对蒙古民族工业的发展起着很大作用。
    目前，蒙古工人和职员已经达到十三万二千人。工人数目不仅在数量上增多了，质量上也发生了变化，他们的政治文化和技术水平也提高了。在最近投入生产的许多新工厂中，中学毕业程度的工人不断增加。
    “真理报”指出，蒙古的民族工业已经成为国民经济的一个独立部门。在第一个五年计划期间，工业产品产量每年平均增长2.4％，第二个五年计划每年平均增长率达到13.1％，三年计划头两年的工业生产计划已按期完成，今年上半年工业产品产量比去年同期增长了21.2％。
    蒙古工人厉行节约，在生产中提出许多发明创造和合理化建议，节约大量资金，促进社会主义工业的发展。仅在1959年就为国家节约了三百五十万图格里克。蒙古工业企业中的青年工人最近广泛地展开了利用生产中的废物和收集金属的运动。他们保证在蒙古革命四十周年以前节约三千万图格里克。
    “真理报”说，蒙古在工业发展方面已经超过了巴基斯坦、阿富汗、缅甸、土耳其、伊拉克和利比亚等国家。
    在从明年开始的第三个五年计划期间，蒙古工人将在建设国家社会主义物质技术基础的事业中作出更大贡献。他们的主要任务是进一步增进工业和农牧业的联系，对农牧业提供生产和技术资源。
    新华社乌兰巴托11日电　据“蒙古青年真理报”报道，蒙古革命青年团的团员和青年们在国家生产建设方面发挥着重大的作用。
    据报道，在蒙古工人中，青年人占70％以上，他们一向走在采用先进生产技术的最前列。争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的竞赛，就是由青年团员发起的。现在，全国共有十五个“社会主义劳动队”，有五百七十六个生产队正在为争取“社会主义劳动队”称号而努力，它们共有七千多名队员，其中绝大部分是青年。
    在农牧业战线上，青年团员们在农牧业的社会主义改造方面作出了巨大的贡献。他们最先响应蒙古人民革命党提出的发展农业生产和在最近几年内满足国内人民对面粉的需要的号召，到开荒地区开荒。在垦荒的第一年（1959年），青年们就开垦了四万公顷荒地。现在这些新垦地上已经长出庄稼，青年们劳动的果实就要收到了。青年们为了灌溉农田和牧场，曾经在巴彦洪果尔和戈壁阿尔泰等省挖掘了长达一千多公里的渠道，可以用来灌溉三万五千多公顷土地。同时，农牧业合作社的青年正在努力增殖牲畜和提高畜产品的产量。
    蒙古广大青年已经开始向掌握几种技术进军。目前，在农牧业部门中已经有六千九百九十五个青年掌握了两种专门技术，有三千六百多个青年掌握了三种技术。
    今年以来，青年职工们已提出了九百多项发明创造和合理化建议，其中已有80％付诸实现。
