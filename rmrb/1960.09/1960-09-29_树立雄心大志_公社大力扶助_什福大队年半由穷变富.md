According to the Guangxi Daily, the 173 Yao and Han ethnic households of the Shifu Brigade in the Jiao You Commune of Ling Le County, Guangxi Province, have great ambitions, high aspirations, and sufficient drive to strive for self-improvement, transforming the barren stony mountains into treasure mountains that produce more grain. Last year, after a year of hard work, they caught up with the wealthy brigade adjacent to them, the Shangsan Brigade. Last year, the Shangsan Brigade had an average of 845 jin of grain per person and an income of 102 yuan per household; the Shifu Brigade had an average of 876 jin of grain per person and an income of 105 yuan per household.

This year, after another half-year of hard work, they have significantly surpassed the Shangsan Brigade: In the first half of the year, the Shangsan Brigade harvested an average of 516 jin of grain per person during the summer harvest, with a household income of 25.3 yuan; the Shifu Brigade harvested an average of 597 jin of grain per person during the summer harvest, 81 jin more than the Shangsan Brigade, with a household income of 47 yuan, 21.7 yuan more than the Shangsan Brigade.

The Shifu Brigade was originally the poorest of the fifteen brigades in the Jiao You Commune. This brigade is located in a stony mountainous area with seven parts stone and three parts soil, and the soil quality is poor. The entire brigade's 1,314 mu of land are scattered across 113 "dongchang" (mountain hollows), all of which are stony and rocky land. Moreover, due to the steep slopes and severe soil erosion, the yield was very low, with an average yield of only just over 130 jin per mu before collectivization. Before liberation, the entire brigade had an average of only 230 jin of grain per person per year, and even by 1957, before collectivization, the average grain per person was only just over 390 jin. Before 1957, they could only survive with continuous state relief. It was only in 1958, after collectivization, with the vigorous support of the commune, that the brigade was able to achieve grain self-sufficiency for the first time and sell some surplus grain to the state (in this year, the average grain per person increased to more than 600 jin). However, due to the weak foundation, the impoverished situation had not been completely changed. At this time, although the cadres and commune members had straightened their backs a little, few dared to think about what would happen next and whether they could catch up with the wealthy brigades in the commune. It just so happened that in this year, the neighboring Shangsan Brigade, after a year of hard work, caught up with the wealthy brigades, setting an example for poor brigades in the stony mountainous area to catch up with the rich.

The Shangsan Brigade catching up with the rich brigades had a very profound educational effect on the cadres and commune members of the Shifu Brigade. They were ambitious and full of fighting spirit, determined to learn from Shangsan and catch up with Shangsan. To change the impoverished situation, they had to implement the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations. Based on the specific conditions of their brigade, they adopted measures such as building rock walls, vigorously carrying out soil and water conservation, transforming rocky land, establishing expeditions, and vigorously engaging in intercropping and relay cropping, changing unfavorable natural conditions and increasing the unit yield of farmland.

While focusing on grain production, the brigade also developed industry and sideline occupations according to the principle of doing more during slack seasons and doing less or not at all during busy seasons, increasing the income of commune members. There are abundant iron ore resources here. During the period of the advanced cooperative, an iron smelting plant was established, but it was later shut down. Last year, they used their spare time to restore the iron smelting plant, burning charcoal to smelt iron and sand-casting agricultural implements, which increased income by 4,200 yuan in just over three months. They also used cat beans and wild feed to develop pig, sheep, and rabbit farming. Due to the continuous development of agriculture, industry, and sideline occupations in the brigade, the impoverished situation was rapidly changed.

    树立雄心大志　公社大力扶助
　　什福大队年半由穷变富
    据广西日报消息　广西凌乐加尤公社什福大队一百七十三户瑶、汉族社员，雄心大、志气高，干劲足，发愤图强，把贫瘠的石山，改造成为多产粮食的宝山，去年奋战一年，就赶上了和他们相毗连的富队——上伞大队。去年上伞大队平均每人有粮八百四十五斤，每户收入一百零二元；什福大队平均每人有粮八百七十六斤，每户收入一百零五元。
    今年再战半年，又显著地超过了上伞大队：上半年，上伞大队夏收粮食平均每人五百一十六斤，每户收入二十五元三角；什福大队夏收粮食平均每人五百九十七斤，比上伞大队多八十一斤，每户收入四十七元，比上伞大队多二十一元七角。
    什福大队原来是加尤公社十五个大队中最穷的一个队。这个队地处七分石三分土的石山区，土质贫瘠。全队一千三百一十四亩地，分散在一百一十三个峒场，全是石山岩颗地；而且由于地的坡度大，水土流失严重，产量很低，公社化前平均亩产才一百三十多斤。解放前全大队平均每人每年只有粮食二百三十斤，到公社化前的1957年，平均每人有粮也不过三百九十斤。1957年以前，连年都要国家救济才过得去。只是到了公社化的1958年，在公社大力扶助下，这个大队才第一次做到粮食自给，并有些余粮卖给国家（这一年全队平均每人有粮增加到六百多斤），毕竟由于底子太薄，还没有彻底改变穷困面貌。这时，干部和社员的腰杆子虽然挺起一些来了，但是，再往前怎么样？能不能赶上社里的富队呢？就很少有人敢去想了。恰巧就在这一年，相邻的上伞大队经过一年苦干，赶上了富队。给石山区的穷队赶富队树立了榜样。
    上伞大队赶上富队，对什福大队的干部社员教育非常深刻，他们雄心勃勃，斗志昂扬，决心学习上伞、赶上上伞。要改变贫困面貌，就必须贯彻执行以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营的方针，他们根据本队具体情况，采取了砌岩墙，大搞水土保持，改造岩颗地；建立远征队；大搞间种套种等措施，改变了不利的自然条件，提高了农田的单位产量。
    这个大队在狠抓粮食的同时，根据农闲多办、农忙少办或不办的原则，发展工业副业，增加社员收入。这里铁矿丰富，高级社时期，曾办过炼铁厂，后来停办了。去年他们利用农闲时间，把炼铁厂恢复起来，烧炭炼铁，翻砂制农具，三个多月就增加了四千二百元的收入。他们还利用猫豆和野生饲料，发展养猪，养羊，养兔。由于这个队农业和工业副业不断发展，迅速改变了贫穷面貌。
