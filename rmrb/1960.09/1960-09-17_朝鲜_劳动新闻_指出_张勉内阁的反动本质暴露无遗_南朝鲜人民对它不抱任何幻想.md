Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 14th: The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today pointing out that the reshuffle of the South Korean Chang Myon puppet "cabinet" on the 12th can neither ease the increasingly acute political crisis in South Korea, nor can it change the thoroughly reactionary nature of the Chang Myon "cabinet." The South Korean people cannot harbor any illusions about it.

The commentary said that the political foundation of the Chang Myon "cabinet" is the "Democratic Party." The upper echelons of the "Democratic Party," whether "new faction" or "old faction," are all reactionary conservative groups of pro-American, pro-Japanese elements, landlords, and comprador capitalists. There is no difference whatsoever between the "new faction" and the "old faction" in terms of "political views" and "policies." After the collapse of the Syngman Rhee group, the factional struggles between these two factions became apparent due to the scramble for power. This "reshuffle" merely resulted in a few "new faction" members being replaced by a few "old faction" members.

The commentary said that since the Chang Myon puppet government came to power, it has done nothing other than continue to implement Syngman Rhee's traitorous and anti-people policies and methods without any changes. If anything, it has become even more "pro-Japanese" than Syngman Rhee. Chang Myon is a pro-Japanese element who became infamous under the Japanese name "Okama Myeon." Later, he served under Syngman Rhee as "Ambassador to the United States," "Prime Minister," and "Vice President," becoming a pro-American ringleader who faithfully served American imperialism. The very fact that this kind of pro-American and pro-Japanese lackey is engaging in "politics" in South Korea today and organizing a cabinet in South Korea is an intolerable insult to the South Korean people and the entire Korean people.

The commentary said that Chang Myon recently colluded with Japanese Foreign Minister Kosaka in creating various political conspiracies against the Korean people, clamoring for "ROK-Japan friendship," and conspiring to obstruct the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan. These are all traitorous acts by Chang Myon, opening the way for the remnants of Japanese militarism to carry out aggression for his own dirty political ambitions.

The commentary said that Chang Myon's so-called "anti-communist policy" is nothing more than maintaining the American imperialist colonial rule in South Korea, suppressing the South Korean people's struggle for democratic freedom, the right to survival, and the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, making the artificial division of Korea permanent, and obstructing mutual contact and economic and cultural exchange between the North and South under the banner of "anti-communism," even hindering communication between parents, relatives, and friends separated in the North and South.

The commentary said that the Chang Myon "cabinet," as a tool for American imperialism to implement its imperialist enslavement policy in South Korea, has fully exposed its pro-Japanese and pro-American nature from the first day it came to power and has become the object of condemnation by the South Korean people. This "reshuffle" of the "cabinet" by Chang Myon cannot solve the serious political, economic, and social contradictions existing in South Korea today, nor can it deceive the people, and therefore it cannot stop the South Korean people's struggle for a new politics and a new life.

### 朝鲜“劳动新闻”指出  张勉内阁的反动本质暴露无遗  南朝鲜人民对它不抱任何幻想

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”指出
    张勉内阁的反动本质暴露无遗  南朝鲜人民对它不抱任何幻想
    新华社平壤14日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论指出，南朝鲜张勉傀儡“内阁”12日的改组既不能缓和南朝鲜日益尖锐的政治危机，更不能改变张勉“内阁”的彻头彻尾的反动性质。南朝鲜人民不能对它抱任何幻想。
    评论说，张勉“内阁”的政治基础是“民主党”，“民主党”的上层组织不论“新派”还是“旧派”都是亲美亲日派和地主、买办资本家的反动保守集团。“新派”和“旧派”在“政见”和“政策”上没有任何不同。李承晚集团垮台后，这两派间的派系斗争因争夺政权而表面化了。这次“改组”只是几名“新派”退出了，几名“旧派”代替了他们。
    评论说，张勉傀儡政府上台以来除了原封不动地继续实行李承晚的卖国反人民的政策和手法以外没有作任何事情。如果说作了的话那就是比李承晚更“亲日”。张勉是以“玉冈勉”的日本名字而臭名远扬的亲日派。后来又在李承晚手下充当“驻美大使”、“国务总理”、“副总统”，成为美帝国主义忠实服务的亲美派头子。这种亲美亲日走狗今天在南朝鲜搞什么“政治”，在南朝鲜组织什么内阁的事实本身，就是对南朝鲜人民和全体朝鲜人民的不可容忍的侮辱。
    评论说，张勉最近同日本外相小坂共同制造了各种反对朝鲜人民的政治阴谋，叫嚷什么“韩日亲善”，共谋阻挠旅日朝侨归国工作，这都是张勉为了他自己的肮脏的政治野心，而为日本军国主义残余开辟侵略道路的卖国行为。
    评论说，张勉所叫嚷的“反共政策”，只不过是维持美帝国主义在南朝鲜的殖民统治制度，镇压南朝鲜人民争取民主自由和生存权利、和平统一祖国的斗争，使朝鲜的人为的分裂永久化，在“反共”口号下阻碍南北间互相接触和经济、文化交流，甚至阻挠被分隔在南北两部的父母亲友间互通音讯。
    评论说，作为美帝国主义在南朝鲜实行其帝国主义奴役政策的工具的张勉“内阁”从它上台的第一天起就充分暴露了它亲日亲美的本质，成了南朝鲜人民谴责的对象。张勉这次“改组”“内阁”丝毫也不能解决今天在南朝鲜造成的严重的政治、经济、社会矛盾，也欺骗不了人民，因此也阻挡不住南朝鲜人民要求新政治和新生活的斗争。
