Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 17th. Qinghai, in the spirit of "take the current step, look at the next step, grasp the present with one hand, grasp the coming year with the other," is launching a mass selection and retention of superior seeds in conjunction with the summer and autumn harvests, to prepare sufficient seeds for expanded planting next year. According to incomplete statistics, the province has already selected and retained more than 4 million jin of various crop varieties by ear selection and block selection for next year.

As early as mid-July, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee issued a call to all parts of the province to "carry out a seed selection campaign," requiring that all seeds needed for seed fields next year be selected by ear, and all seeds needed for general fields be selected by block, ensuring that enough is selected, retained, and properly stored. According to this requirement and the production plan for next year, the province, prefectures, cities, counties, and people's communes, and state-owned farms, have all formulated plans for selecting and retaining superior seeds, and made specific arrangements in terms of labor, time, and seed warehouses. Many areas have also held seed selection technology training courses to vigorously impart seed selection, seed retention technology, and experience in storing seeds.

In order to effectively do a good job in the selection and retention of superior seeds, temporary institutions have been generally established in various places after the start of the summer and autumn harvests, to vigorously grasp the work of selecting and retaining superior seeds. The Qunke People's Commune of the Hualong Hui Autonomous County and its subordinate brigades and production teams have all established superior seed evaluation committees or seed selection and retention leading groups, and adopted the method of combining cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers, to go to the fields together to lead the commune members to harvest while selecting seeds. Every day, more than 200 commune members in the entire commune are involved in seed selection. While rushing to harvest the summer fields, the communes and brigades in Gonghe County organized cadres and experienced farmers to appraise the crops in the seed fields and high-yield plots one by one, and selected high-yield plots with tall plants, large ears, many grains, and full grains, to harvest and thresh separately, and retain them as seeds. The party secretaries of the Shatangchuan and Heerchuan communes in the Huzhu Tu Autonomous County went deep into the fields and greatly promoted the work of selecting and retaining superior seeds by holding on-site observation meetings for seed selection.

Under the guidance of the idea that the national economy is based on agriculture, Qinghai Province has reclaimed a large amount of wasteland this year, and the planting area will be greatly expanded next year. In order to prepare sufficient superior seeds of various types needed for expanded planting, all localities have paid great attention to the breeding of superior seeds this year. People's communes have generally selected production teams with better conditions for breeding superior seeds to establish superior seed breeding farms and seed breeding professional teams, forming a large number of superior seed breeding bases. The Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, with the original state-owned superior seed breeding farm as the core, has established thirteen commune superior seed breeding farms and one hundred and fifty-seven seed breeding professional teams, forming a complete superior seed breeding system. Huangzhong, Ledu, Datong and other counties have also established a large number of professional superior seed breeding institutions and seed bases. The establishment of these seed fields has provided favorable conditions for selecting and retaining sufficient superior seeds of various types needed for next year. (Attached picture)

### 走上步　看下步　一手抓当前　一手抓明年  青海选留良种运动搞的好  全省已经为明年穗选、块选各种作物良种四百多万斤

    走上步　看下步　一手抓当前　一手抓明年
    青海选留良种运动搞的好
    全省已经为明年穗选、块选各种作物良种四百多万斤
    新华社西宁17日电　青海本着走上步，看下步，一手抓当前，一手抓明年的精神，结合夏秋收，展开了一个群众性的选留良种运动，为明年扩种准备足够的种子。据不完全统计，目前全省已经穗选、块选各种作物良种四百多万斤。
    早在7月中旬，中共青海省委和省人民委员会就向全省各地提出了“开展选种运动”的号召，要求种子田明年所需的种子，全部经过穗选，一般田所需的种子，全部经过块选，保证做到选够、留足，保管好。根据这一要求和明年的生产计划，省、州、市、县和各人民公社、国营农场，都普遍制定了选留良种的计划，并在劳力、时间和种子仓库等方面作了具体安排。许多地区还举办了选种技术训练班，大力传授选种、留种技术和保管贮藏种子的经验。
    为了切实做好良种选留工作，各地在夏秋收开始后，普遍成立了临时机构，狠抓良种选留工作。化隆回族自治县群科人民公社和所属各大队、生产队都成立了良种评选委员会，或选种留种领导小组，并采取干部、技术员、老农三结合的办法，会师到田，领导社员一边收割，一边选种，全社投入选种的社员每天都在二百多人左右。共和县在抢收夏田的同时，各公社、大队都组织了干部、老农对种子田，丰产方的庄稼逐块进行鉴定，评选出株高、穗大、粒多、粒饱的丰产地块，单收、单打，留作种子。互助土族自治县沙塘川、贺尔川等公社的党委书记，深入田间，通过召开选种现场观摩会等办法，大大推动了良种选留工作。
    青海省在国民经济以农业为基础的思想指导下，今年开垦了大量荒地，明年播种面积将有很大扩大。为了备足扩种所需的各种良种，今年各地都十分注意良种繁育工作。人民公社普遍选择了繁殖良种条件较好的生产队，建立良种繁殖场和种子繁殖专业队，形成了大量的良种繁育基地。互助土族自治县以原有的一个国营良种繁殖场为核心，建立了十三处公社良种繁殖场，一百五十七个种子繁殖专业队，形成了一套完整的良种繁育系统。湟中、乐都、大通等县也都建立了大量的良种繁育专业机构和种子基地。这些种子田的建立，为选够留足明年所需的各种良种提供了有利的条件。（附图片）
