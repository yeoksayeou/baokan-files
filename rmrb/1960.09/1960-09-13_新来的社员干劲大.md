    New Commune Member Has Great Enthusiasm
    Wei Caiying, who worked at the Weijiazhuang Flour Mill in Changzhi, Shanxi Province, actively responded to the Party's call and returned to the agricultural production front. On the evening of her return to the village, the whole family held a meeting to welcome her. Caiying said at the meeting: "The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production is very timely. Grain is the most precious treasure, and no one can live without it. After returning to the agricultural production front, I will have a competition with Lao Er." As soon as she finished speaking, Wei Jingui rushed to say: "Challenge accepted, challenge accepted! Let's compete and see who has more enthusiasm in production." The next day, as soon as the east turned light, all the people in the family who could work went to the fields. Caiying and Jingui carried soil to level the land, chasing each other, both afraid of falling behind. During the break, Caiying went into the field to pull wild vegetables, and Jingui cut yellow wormwood on the edge of the ditch. At dinner, the production team leader announced their production achievements. Caiying earned fourteen work points, and also collected thirty catties of wild vegetables and picked up half a basket of manure; Jingui earned fifteen work points and cut thirty-five catties of yellow wormwood. Then Caiying publicly announced her production plan: to guarantee forty workdays within a month, and also collect two hundred catties of wild vegetables, and requested to start a competition with the female commune members of the whole team. The commune members applauded and welcomed her, saying: "The new commune member has great enthusiasm!"

    新来的社员干劲大
    在山西省长治魏家庄面粉加工厂作工的魏采英，积极响应党的号召，回到农业生产战线。回村的当天晚上，全家开会欢迎她。采英在会上说：“党中央、毛主席提出大办农业、大办粮食的号召正是时候，粮食是宝中宝，谁也离不了。我回到农业生产战线以后，要和老二开展对手赛。”她的话刚落音，魏金贵就抢着说：“应战，应战！咱们要比一比，赛一赛，看谁在生产中干劲大。”第二天，东方刚发亮，全家能劳动的人就都下地了。采英和金贵挑土垫地，你追我赶，谁都怕自己落在后边。休息的时候，采英钻到地里拔野菜，金贵在沟边割黄蒿。吃晚饭时，生产队长宣布了他俩的生产成绩，采英做了十四个工分，此外还采集野菜三十斤，捎带拾了半筐粪；金贵做了十五个工分，割了黄蒿三十五斤。接着采英当众宣布了自己的生产计划：保证在一个月内做四十个劳动日，还采野菜二百斤，并要求与全队的女社员开展对手赛。社员拍手欢迎说：“新来的社员干劲真大！”
