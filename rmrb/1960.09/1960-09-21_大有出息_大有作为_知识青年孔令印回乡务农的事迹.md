　　　　　　　The "College Student" Returns
　　One evening in April 1958, commune members from Qianying Village in Xian County were returning home after work when a young man carrying luggage appeared on the road northwest of the village. Several young people greeted him with joy, some rushing to help him carry his things, others patting him on the shoulder and asking:
　　“You’ve graduated, where have you been assigned to work?”
　　When he explained that he had returned to his village to participate in production, people looked at him with suspicion. Kong Linghuai, who had been his classmate since childhood, jokingly said:
　　“You’re the only ‘college student’ in our village (actually he was a student at an agricultural college), coming home to work?”
　　Kong Lingyin's return to his village to participate in agricultural production quickly caused a stir in the whole village. Some old people said:
　　“Our village has never produced a college graduate who has gone out to work in the big cities. This is great, our village will definitely change!” Others said: "He won't stay long, our village is small and poor, the water is too shallow to keep a big fish." Lingyin's father, Kong Xiangzhen, who had worked on boats for landlords since he was a child, and whose ancestors had labored in the countryside for generations, even mocked Lingyin, saying, "Our family hasn't had a literate person for generations. It was hard enough to 'ingratiate' you out, why do you have to be a farmer!"
　　In contrast to these opinions, the village cadres warmly welcomed and comforted him. As soon as Lingyin entered the village, the commune leader Kong Baoju (the current deputy production leader) greeted him with a beaming smile, took his hand and said: "Great! We've been looking forward to your return for a long time, you know how much our commune needs educated people." Party Branch Secretary Gao Lizhen, seeing that Lingyin's return had caused some different opinions among the masses, said at a Party and Youth League meeting: "Lingyin has returned to build our countryside. We need him now, and as the countryside develops in the future, we will need even more educated people. He won't be used to the work at first, so let him do lighter work….”
　　Kong Lingyin, a member of the Communist Youth League, went to work in the fields the day after he returned home. He joined the youth "Tiger Assault Team" and, together with the young men, carried red flags and went to the fields to carry water and plant seeds. He didn't show any weakness among these tiger-like youths, always choosing the biggest buckets to carry and walking ahead of everyone else. His shoulders became swollen, and his legs ached so much that he couldn't get on the bed. The cadres advised him to rest, and the assault team members hid his buckets, but he wouldn't listen, always saying, "Strength is forged, only through a hundred refinements can one become steel." The Party branch asked Lingyin to cultivate sweet potato seedlings. He felt that this was a very important task, so he took out the seedling cultivation lecture notes he had studied at school and studied them while working. He got up early every day to light the fire, get water, and test the temperature, and after breakfast, he went to the fields with the commune members, returning late at night to take care of the seedling beds. He worked like this for more than twenty days, and later became ill from exhaustion.
　　When the cadres and commune members learned that Lingyin was ill, they came to visit him one after another. On the first day of his illness, the Party Branch Secretary and the commune leader came to see him three or four times. Some villagers brought him snacks, and the mother of poor peasant commune member Kong Lingfu carried half a basket of eggs, saying to Lingyin's mother as she entered the door: "These are for Lingyin, to nourish the child and make him strong. Lingyin is both literate and capable, our village just lacks educated people!" Lingyin was so moved that tears streamed down his face. The old woman's words expressed the commune members' hope that Lingyin would stay. Lingyin lay in bed, full of thoughts, unable to calm down for a long time.

　　　　　　What Counts as Success?
　　More than three months later. One day, Lingyin returned from the low-lying area with sweat and mud on his face. As soon as he put down his hoe, his father said in a bad mood: "You'd better leave me quickly, if you keep doing this, people will laugh their heads off!" In recent days, Lingyin had constantly seen his father's unhappy face, and his mother and wife were also constantly hinting at him. His mother said: "Look, your two elder brothers didn't go to school, but they are still working outside. You went to school for more than ten years, but you became a farmer."
　　At this moment, Lingyin received six or seven letters from his classmates, some telling him that they had been admitted to railway schools, some had joined factories, some had become car drivers, and some even advised him to take the university entrance exam…
　　At this time, Lingyin's mood was very chaotic. He thought, carrying water, hoeing, emptying manure, doing tiring work, doing dirty work, these difficulties were nothing to worry about. But the fact that his parents, who had been constrained by the habits of the old society for so many years, did not support him, and the sarcasm and ridicule of a few individuals, could be understood. However, did the countryside really need him, or did it not need him? Was it only success to go to the city, or could he also achieve "success" in the countryside? These questions made him unable to resolve it.
　　He took out "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" and read the foreword to this book written by Chairman Mao several times in a row: "All such intellectuals who can work in the countryside should be happy to go there. The countryside is a vast world where they can make a big difference." The first time he read this foreword at school, he felt that Chairman Mao had pointed out a bright road for the vast number of educated youth. Today, when he revisited Chairman Mao's words, he felt even more cordial and wise.
　　He clenched his fists and secretly vowed: He would resolutely listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, take Xu Jianchun as an example, and contribute everything to building a socialist new countryside.

　　　　　　　Lingyin is Good at It!
　　When Kong Lingyin first returned home, he thought that he only needed to put down his student airs and take the lead in working hard. Later, through the education of the Party branch and his own practice, he realized that if he wanted to change the face of his hometown, it was not enough to just charge into battle in labor. Party Branch Secretary Gao Lizhen often encouraged him like this: "You must do more if you are capable. You must be a machine operator, an agricultural science researcher, a civil school teacher, and a pig expert."
　　Once, he returned from studying at the commune Party school and saw that the wheat seedlings west of the village were growing very well, but some were turning into patches of white alkali and had no seedlings. He began to think about how to treat the alkaline land. When he got home, he put down his luggage and went to discuss it with the branch secretary. He introduced the six or seven methods of transforming saline-alkali land that he had seen at the Beijing Agricultural Exhibition Hall in 1957, and the knowledge of saline-alkali land that he had learned at school, and put forward suggestions for transforming the alkaline land. The branch secretary supported him very much and called a meeting of team cadres that evening to study the matter. Everyone said that the method he proposed was good, and they decided to entrust this task to their youth Tiger Assault Team. After two springs of hard work, the entire team transformed more than 300 mu of heavily alkaline land, and the corn and wheat they planted grew better than in the past. After their experience was popularized throughout the management area, more than 4,800 mu of alkaline land have now been transformed.
　　When planting peanuts in March this year, the commune distributed a six-horsepower gasoline engine to the Qianying Production Team. The cadres and commune members were extremely happy, but people were just circling around it, and no one knew how to start it. Later, this task was entrusted to Lingyin, and a technician was invited from the Xicheng Farm to teach him. Kong Lingyin had learned about the installation and use of tractors and double-share plows at school and understood some basic knowledge. Under the guidance of this technician, he learned how to start the machine in half a day. Unfortunately, the gasoline engine roared to life, but the water pump couldn't suck up water, and the technician left again. Lingyin took out the "lecture notes" he had studied for reference and checked the various systems of the machine's power, combustion, and ignition, but there was nothing wrong with them. Later, he found that a screw on the water pump was loose. He tightened the screw, and it no longer leaked air. As soon as the machine started, water gurgled out of the faucet of the water pump, more than a person's height.
　　"Hey, the machine is pumping water!" Immediately a crowd of people gathered around, including old people in their seventies and eighties, as well as children of several years old, and the commune members planting in the fields also ran over. The young people jumped up and shouted: "Lingyin, the 'college student' is good at it!"
　　Originally, more than 20 people could only plant one mu of land in a day by carrying water, but using a machine to pump water, they could plant nine mu in a day. After planting peanuts, Lingyin brought the gasoline engine back to the team, and after painstakingly studying it, he attached a millstone and a hand-cranked straw cutter to the machine, and used the machine to cut straw and grind flour. From then on, Lingyin also changed in the eyes of some people who originally thought he was "unpromising."
　　On July 29th this year, Lingyin had just finished dinner at the canteen and was walking home when there was a flash of lightning in the sky, and a torrential rain began immediately, lasting for more than four hours. The house leaked so much that there was no place to stand, and the water in the yard was half a foot deep. Lingyin's wife, Wang Xiufen, was busy tidying up clothes and turning over furniture in the house. Lingyin, however, was staring out the window in a daze. His heart had long gone to the high-yield plot in Xiwai. He thought that it had just rained heavily a few days ago, and this time the corn and sweet potatoes in Xiwai must have been flooded… Before the wind and rain had stopped, he ran out, and this sudden action startled his wife. When she asked him what was going on and learned that he was going to Xiwai to see the crops, she draped a piece of oilcloth that was spread on the kang over him and said: "While worrying about the crops of the team, you must also pay attention to your own body!"

　　　　　　　This Road is the Right One
　　Lingyin is just like what the Party branch secretary expected. He contributed everything he had learned and everything he knew to the glorious cause of developing agriculture.
　　According to the instructions of the Party branch, he often conducted education for the young people on settling down in agricultural production and conducting communist future education. He often talked to his young friends about his own personal experience and said, "What is called promising? Listening to the Party and contributing to the cause of communism is the most promising. Building our team well, and when one team after another is good, the whole country will be good…." Now, when the young people in this village get together, they don't judge people and talk about trivial matters, but often talk about the bright future. The young people study the heroic deeds of the "Five Heroes" Youth Assault Team, the Iron Girls, and Xing Yanzi. The more they study, the broader their horizons become, the greater their ambition to be red and specialized in the countryside, and the stronger their will to change the poor face of the countryside. In recent years, not a single young person in this village has blindly gone out to work. Eight junior and senior primary school graduates are all working happily in the countryside.
　　Kong Lingyin has learned more solid knowledge through production practice. He not only brought the knowledge he had learned from school back to the countryside and sowed the seeds of scientific knowledge on the land of his hometown, but also tempered and improved himself. The botany and mechanics he had studied at school, after personally planting experimental fields and operating machines, were understood more deeply and truly became useful and living knowledge.
　　Kong Lingyin's Youth League branch has always been a red flag branch in the entire county. Because Lingyin often persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works and studying the Party's policies, he was recently rated as an activist in studying theory among young people in Tianjin.
　　The road that Kong Lingyin has taken proves that what Chairman Mao said about the countryside being a vast world is absolutely true. Young people who listen to the Party and Chairman Mao and settle down in the countryside to build a beautiful home, educated young people who happily return to the countryside to participate in construction, are all promising and accomplished. Now, Kong Lingyin's father also often says with a smile:
　　"Lingyin has taken the right road!" (Attached picture)

　　大有出息　大有作为
　　知识青年孔令印回乡务农的事迹
　　河北日报记者　辛心新　夯开　胡继洲
                “大学生”回来了
    1958年4月的一个傍晚，献县前营村的社员们收了工往家走，有一个背着行李的小伙子出现在村西北的大道上，几个小青年喜出望外地迎上去，有的抢着替他背东西，有的拍着他的肩膀问：
      “你毕业了，分配到哪去工作呀？”
    当他说明自己是回乡参加生产时，人们都用怀疑的目光瞅着他。小时候跟他同过学的孔令淮半打趣地说：
    “咱村就你一个‘大学生’（其实他是农业专科学校的学生），回家参加劳动？”
    孔令印回家参加农业生产的事，很快轰动了全村。有的老人说：
  “咱村从开天立地就没有出过走京闯府的大学生，这可好了，咱村非变个样不可。”也有的说：“人家呆不久，咱村又小又穷，水浅养不住大鱼。”令印的父亲孔祥振从小给地主弄船，祖辈几代都劳动在农村，今天竟也挖苦令印说：“咱家几辈子没有个识字的，好容易把你‘巴结’出来，怎么你非要当庄稼汉！”
    同这些意见相反的，是村干部们的热情欢迎和安慰。令印刚一进村时，社长孔宝巨（现在的生产副队长）就满面披笑地迎上来，拉住他的手说：“好哇！早就盼你回来，你知道咱们社里多需要有文化的人。”党支部书记高立祯，看到令印回家来在群众中引起了一些不同的议论，在一次党团员大会上说：“令印回家来是建设咱们的农村，现在需要他，将来农村发展了，更需要有文化的人。他乍干活不习惯，要让他干轻活……。”
    共青团员孔令印回家第二天，就下地干活了。他参加了青年“猛虎突击队”，跟青年小伙子们一起，扛着红旗，下地挑水点种。他在这些猛虎般的青年中，一点也不示弱，净拣大桶挑，走在别人前边。膀子磨肿了，腿疼得上不去炕，干部们劝他休息，突击队员们把桶藏起，他都不听，总是说：“力气是炼出来的，只有百炼才能成钢。”党支部叫令印培育甘薯秧，他觉得这是一项很重要的任务，便把在学校学过的育秧法讲义拿出来，边干边钻。天天起早烧火、上水、试温，吃过早饭就又跟社员们一起下地，天黑回来又照顾薯炕。这样干了二十多天，后来累病了。
    干部、社员们知道令印病了，纷纷来看望。在他得病的第一天，党支部书记、社长就跑了三、四趟来看他。有的老乡给送来点心，贫农社员孔令福的母亲挎来了半篮子鸡蛋，进门就对令印的母亲说：“是给令印送来的，让孩子养得壮壮实实的。令印能文能武，咱村就是缺少文化人呀！”当时感动得令印流出了热泪。这位老妈妈的话，表达了社员们盼望令印留下来的心愿。令印躺在床上，满腹心思，好久不能平静下来。
              怎样才算有出息？
    三个多月以后。一天，令印脸上带着汗水和泥巴从洼里回来，刚刚放下锄头，父亲就没好气地说：“你快给我走吧，这样干下去，还不叫人家笑掉大牙！”近些天来，令印不断看到父亲不高兴的脸色，母亲、妻子也不断转着弯说他。母亲说：“你看，你两个哥没上过学，还在外边工作，你上了这十几年学，倒当了庄稼汉。”
    在这当儿，令印又连着接到了六、七个同学的来信，有的人告诉他自己考上铁路学校了，有的人参加工厂了，有的人当汽车司机了，有的人还劝他去考大学……。
    这时，令印的心绪很乱。他想，挑水、锄地、掏屎、担尿，干累活，干脏活，这些困难都不在话下，多少年来受旧社会的习惯势力束缚着的父母对自己不支持，个别人的讽刺嘲笑，也可以理解。可是，农村到底需要自己，还是不需要自己？到城市去才算有出息，还是在农村同样也能干出“出息”来？这些问号使他解决不了。
    他翻出“中国农村的社会主义高潮”来，连着把毛主席写的这本书的按语看了好几遍：“一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”他在学校里第一次看这个按语时，就觉得毛主席为广大知识青年指出一条光明大道，今天重温毛主席这段话时，越发感到亲切、明智。
    他握紧拳头暗暗地表示：要坚决听党和毛主席的话，要以徐建春为榜样，为建设社会主义新农村贡献出自己的一切。
            还是令印行啊！
    孔令印刚回到家来，以为只要放下学生架子，带头苦干就行了。后来在党支部的教育和自己的实践中体会到，要想改变家乡的面貌，只在劳动上冲锋陷阵还不够。党支书高立祯常这样勉励他：“你要能者多劳，机器手、农业科学研究员、民校教师、猪先生，都得当啊。”
    一次，他从公社党校学习回来，看到村西的麦苗有的长得很好，有的泛起一片一片的白碱，没有苗，他就琢磨起治碱地的事来。到家把行李一放，便找支部书记去商量，他介绍了1957年在北京农业展览馆看的有关改造盐碱地的六、七种办法，和他在学校学过的盐碱地的知识，提出改造碱地的建议。支部书记很支持他，当晚就召开队干部会研究，大家都说他提出的办法好，决定把这个任务交给他们的青年猛虎突击队。经过两个春天的奋斗，全队共改造重碱地三百多亩，种的玉米、小麦都比过去长得好。他们的经验在全管理区推广以后，现已改造碱地四千八百多亩。
    今年3月点种花生时，公社分配给前营生产队一台六马力的汽油机。干部、社员们高兴极啦，可是人们干围着转，谁也不会开。后来把这个工作交给令印，又到西城农场请来一位技术工人教他。孔令印在学校里学过拖拉机、双铧犁的安装使用，懂点基础知识，在这位技术工人的指导下，半天他就学会了开机器。不巧的是，汽油机呜呜地转起来了，水泵吸不上水来，技术工人又走了。令印拿出学过的“讲义”来作参考，检查机器的原动、燃烧、点火各个系统，哪也没毛病。后来才发现水泵上有一个螺丝松动了，他把螺丝上紧，不再漏汽了，机器一开，水顺着水泵的龙头突突地冒出来一人多高。
    “嘿，机器抽上水来啦！”顿时围上来一群人，有七、八十岁的老人，也有几岁的孩子，在地里点种的社员们也都跑来了。青年们跳起来喊道：“还是‘大学生’行啊！”
    原来二十多人挑水一天才点种一亩多，使用机器抽水一天就种九亩。点完花生，令印把汽油机弄回队里，又经过苦心钻研，给机器挂上磨，挂上手摇铡草机，铡草、磨面都用机器。从此，令印在有些原来认为他“没出息”的人的眼里也变了样。
    今年7月29日，令印刚从食堂吃过晚饭走回家，天空一阵雷闪，立时下起了倾盆大雨，一气下了四个多小时，房子漏的没立脚之地，院里的积水有半尺深。令印的爱人王秀芬在屋里拾掇衣服、翻倒家什，忙个不停。令印却总望着窗外出神，他的心早就到西洼的丰产方里去了。他想，前两天刚下过透雨，这回西洼的玉米、甘薯非泡了不可……。风雨还没停下来，他撒腿就往外跑，这种突然的行动把他的爱人吓了一跳。等问清是到西洼看庄稼，就把铺在炕上的一块油布给他披在身上，说：“惦记着队里的庄稼，也得注意着自己的身子骨呀！”
              这条路走对了
    令印正像党支书期望的那样，他把自己所学到的一切，懂得的一切，都贡献给了发展农业的光荣事业。
    他按党支部的指示，常向青年们进行安心农业生产的教育，进行共产主义的前途教育；他常以自己的亲身体会和青年朋友们谈：“什么叫有出息？听党的话，为共产主义事业作出贡献，就是最有出息。建设好咱一个队，一个队一个队都好了，整个国家也就都好了……。”如今，这村的青年们到了一起，不是评人论事，谈男道女，而常常谈论灿烂的未来。青年们学习“五英”青年突击队、铁姑娘、邢燕子的英雄事迹。越学习，眼界越宽，红在农村专在农村的雄心越大，叫农村改变贫穷面貌的意志越坚。几年来，这村没有一个盲目外出的青年，八名初中、高小毕业生，都在农村干得很欢。
    孔令印通过生产实践，学到更牢固的知识。他不仅把自己从学校里学得的知识带回了农村，把科学知识的种子撒在了家乡的土地上，同时也锻炼提高了自己。他在学校里学过的植物学、机械学，经过亲手种试验田，开机器，理解得更深，真正成为有用的活知识了。
    孔令印他们的团支部，一直是全县的红旗支部。令印由于经常坚持学习毛主席著作，学习党的方针政策，最近被评为天津市的青年学习理论积极分子。
    孔令印走过来的道路证明，毛主席说的农村是一个广阔的天地，是千真万确的。听党和毛主席的话，安心在农村建设美好家乡的青年们，愉快地回到农村参加建设的知识青年们，都是大有出息、大有作为的。如今，孔令印的父亲也经常乐滋滋地说：
    “令印这条路走对了！”（附图片）
