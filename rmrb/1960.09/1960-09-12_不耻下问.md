“Not ashamed to ask” is a saying of Confucius, and it is very correct.

No one can be an “expert in everything” in this world. A revolutionary cadre is no exception. When our cause is advancing rapidly and things are constantly changing, and we don't understand or fully understand many tasks, but we have to lead and do them, what should we do? One way is for cadres to go deep into the front lines, so that they can learn knowledge and guide work through their own practice. However, we cannot personally practice everything, which requires another method at the same time, that is, to use indirect experience. We should adopt an honest attitude of knowing what we know and admitting what we don't, and when we don't understand something, we should ask, learn, and consult those who do understand.

For a revolutionary cadre, it is extremely important to ask when you don't understand. Because revolutionary cadres are to put forward opinions to guide work based on the actual situation. Any error in the opinion will bring losses to the work. Therefore, half-knowledge, self-righteousness, and pretending to know what you don't know are absolutely undesirable. Asking when you don't understand is not only not shameful, but on the contrary, it is a good and responsible work style, and this style must be promoted.

The method of the Communist Party of China Hubei Province Yuan'an County Committee to select outstanding members from grassroots cadres to form a county committee "advisory group" to strengthen leadership is very good. Outstanding members of grassroots cadres have both rich experience in mass work and rich knowledge of agricultural production. Inviting them to be "advisors" and the county committee comrades "humbly asking" these comrades in an organized and planned way will inevitably make the work better and achieve greater and more direct results. When rice entered the autumn management season, the Yuan'an County Committee adopted the experience of the rice "native experts," and the autumn fields were better managed. During land reclamation, an "advisor" put forward the principle of reclaiming the bottom of the mountain first and then the top of the mountain based on his own land reclamation experience, helping the county committee to make a correct decision. "Not ashamed to ask" has immense benefits.

In the process of "humbly asking" and learning, we must also analyze and study while listening. Indirect experience, like direct experience, is sometimes incomplete, sometimes has particularity or one-sidedness. Just as people say, "It is better to have no book than to completely trust a book," we must analyze the experience we hear and read. Different times, different places, and different conditions require different specific applications of policies, guidelines, and working methods. We cannot simply copy and paste what we hear without studying the specific situation. Whether it is direct experience or indirect experience, we must make a careful study and consideration and make creative decisions in accordance with local conditions and the times when adopting them.

"Not ashamed to ask" and humbly learning from the experience of the masses is a very important aspect of strengthening leadership and improving the level of leadership. The method of setting up an "advisory group" by the Yuan'an County Committee in Hubei Province is worth learning.

### “不耻下问”

    “不耻下问”	李梓
    “不耻下问”是孔夫子的一句话，这句话是很正确的。
    任何人对世界上的事物都不可能“万事通”。一个革命干部也不例外。当我们的事业正一日千里地前进，事物又都在千变万化，我们对许多工作还不懂或不完全懂，而又要去领导，要去作的时候，怎么办？办法之一是干部深入第一线，使干部通过自己的实践，学得知识，指导工作。但是我们又不可能事事都亲自去实践一番，这就需要同时有另一种办法，即利用间接经验。对自己不懂或不完全懂的事采取知之为知之、不知为不知的老老实实态度，有不懂的就问，去学习，去请教懂的人。
    不懂就问，对一个革命干部来说，是极其重要的。因为革命干部是要根据实际情况提出意见去指导工作的。意见有任何错误都会给工作带来损失。因此，一知半解，自以为是，强不知为知，是万万要不得的。不懂就问，这不但不可耻，相反，这是切实负责的好作风，这种作风必须提倡。
    中共湖北省远安县委员会选拔基层干部中的优秀分子成立县委“顾问小组”以加强领导的办法很好。基层干部中的优秀分子既有丰富的群众工作经验，又有丰富的农业生产知识，请他们来作“顾问”，县委的同志有组织有计划地“下问”这些同志，这就必然能使工作作得更好，收到更大、更直接的效果。当水稻进入秋季管理的时候，远安县委采纳了水稻“土专家”的经验，秋田就管得更好。在开荒时，有一位“顾问”根据自己开荒的经验提出了先开山下、后开山上的方针，帮助县委作出了正确的决定。“不耻下问”，好处莫大焉。
    在“下问”学习中，一面听，一面还要分析研究。间接经验和直接经验一样，有时是不完整的、有时是有特殊性或片面性的。正像人们说的“尽信书不如无书”一样，对听来的，和读来的经验，必须分析。不同时间、不同地点、不同条件，在方针政策、工作方法的具体运用上是不同的。不能不研究具体情况，只是听到一点就拿来照抄照作。不论直接经验和间接经验，在采用的时候，我们都必需因时因地制宜，作一番认真的研究考虑，创造性地作出决定。
      “不耻下问”，虚心学习群众的经验，是加强领导、提高领导水平的很重要的一个方面，湖北远安县县委设“顾问小组”的办法值得学习。
