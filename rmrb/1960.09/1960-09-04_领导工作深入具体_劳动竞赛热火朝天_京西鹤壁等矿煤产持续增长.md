    Leaders Work Deeply and Specifically, Labor Emulation is in Full Swing
    Coal Production Continues to Grow in Jingxi, Hebi and Other Mines

    Jingxi Coal Mine

    Xinhua News Agency News: The Jingxi Mining Bureau, which overfulfilled the state coal mining plan in the first seven months of this year, achieved new achievements in continued leap forward in August. The output of raw coal and the total footage of tunneling exceeded the state plan by 13.3% and 9% respectively.

    Since August, the mines under the bureau have widely mobilized the masses to review the production situation in the past seven months, discussed and formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy in the future, and specific measures for completing the plans. While discussing, the workers immediately took action. Labor emulations centered on technological innovation and the promotion of advanced experience were vigorously carried out between mining areas, work sections, and shifts and groups. The workers of the No. 24 tunneling team of the Mentougou Coal Mine repeatedly pondered and improved operations in the competition, adopting the method of "advanced slotting," and the tunneling efficiency increased by 30% compared with July. In the DaTai Coal Mine, the three teams in the No. 2 mining section learned from each other in the competition. When one team created new achievements, the other teams would beat gongs and drums to congratulate and learn from them, and then promote it in their own teams. As a result, each team exceeded production, and the entire month produced an additional 1,978 tons of coal for the state.

    During the movement, the bureau also transferred 376 cadres to strengthen the front line of production, participate in labor, and promptly solve the problems raised by the workers in the discussion of increasing production and practicing economy. The mines also vigorously improved production management, promoted mass management systems such as the "job responsibility system" and "labor cards" among workers, and further stimulated the enthusiasm and creativity of workers in production.

    Hebi Coal Mine

    According to Xinhua News Agency Zhengzhou dispatch: The Hebi Coal Mine in Henan Province achieved a large-scale bumper harvest in production in August. The entire mine overfulfilled the August raw coal production plan three days ahead of schedule on August 28. The total tunneling progress increased by 12.6% compared with the same period last month, and the overall employee efficiency exceeded the state-prescribed target by 26%.

    From January to July this year, the coal output of Hebi Coal Mine had completed 76% of the annual plan. Under this excellent situation, since August, all employees of the mine have generally checked the production situation in the first seven months, discussed the production increase and thrift plan for the next few months, and formulated specific measures. Each working face, each team, each group, and even each individual have arranged production targets for each quarter, each month, each ten-day period, and each day, and proposed measures to achieve these targets.

    While discussing, the employees of each mine took action and set off a new upsurge in increasing coal production. The employees of Chenjiazhuang Mine launched a "production sports meeting" to produce more coal and better coal, as well as labor emulation among shifts, groups, and individuals, so that the average daily output since August has increased by about 8.7% compared with the same period in July. The employees of Doumazhuang No. 2 mine actively innovated coal mining methods, increasing the raw coal recovery rate from 60% to over 80%, increasing the daily coal output from 500 tons to more than 800 tons, and greatly reducing the consumption of pit props.

    Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine

    Xinhua News Agency Fuxin dispatch: The employees of the Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine of Fuxin Coal Mine increased the production of raw coal by more than 58,000 tons in August compared with the state plan.

    August is a rainy season, which is not conducive to open-pit coal mining. However, in order to win high coal production, the employees of Haizhou Open-Pit Mine had already prepared for rain and flood prevention, such as building waterproof projects, increasing drainage equipment, reinforcing line foundations, and checking lightning protection measures. Therefore, it was possible to stop production during heavy rain and seize high production during light rain.

    After the leading cadres at all levels of the mine implemented office work in the well, they went deep into the front line of production to specifically grasp the work of the team, truly solve the key problems in production, and also promoted the continuous rise of production.

    Shandong Xinbo Coal Mine

    Xinhua News Agency Jinan dispatch: Shandong Zibo Xinbo Coal Mine has completed the coal production plan for August 1% ahead of schedule on the 25th. The average daily footage of main roadway tunneling increased by 2.5% compared with the plan; the raw coal gangue content and the consumption of pit props decreased by 19.3% and 2.6% respectively compared with the plan.

    Since August, the employees of Xinbo Coal Mine have conscientiously checked and summarized the production situation in the first seven months of this year, discussed and formulated future plans for increasing production and practicing economy, which greatly encouraged the employees. The mine also reformed the transportation system in response to the key problem of insufficient transportation capacity. After the upgrading system of Fengjialin Small Mine was reformed, the upgrading capacity increased by 67%.

    In order to strive for high production in September, the mine has now prepared four working faces; at the same time, it has carried out a comprehensive overhaul of coal conveying machines, coal cutting machines and other equipment, and renovated more than 400 meters of roadway.

    Shanxi Xuangang Coal Mine

    Xinhua News Agency Taiyuan dispatch: The employees of Xuangang Coal Mine in Shanxi Province tried every means to increase coal production. By August 30, the entire mine had completed the national raw coal production plan for August one day ahead of schedule. The monthly raw coal production increased by 5% compared with July.

    The coal produced by Xuangang Coal Mine is all coking coal, supplying key iron and steel enterprises in Shanghai, Hubei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian and other places. Entering August, the Party Committee of the Mining Bureau conscientiously mobilized the masses and handed over the mine's monthly, ten-day, and daily production plans to the workers for discussion. Each production team and each worker formulated their own production targets for each ten-day period and each day, and carried out competitions between pits, between shifts, and between groups.

    During the competition movement, all employees of the mine took many specific measures to address the key to production. They investigated the production capacity of each mining and tunneling working face, and focused on strengthening the development of main roadways. The mine also transferred more than 500 old technical workers, production team leaders and some cadres who had been transferred from production posts to the mining and tunneling working faces to strengthen the front line of production. The Party Committee of the mine implemented an office system in the well, promptly discovered and solved problems in production, and effectively ensured the early completion of the plan.

    Jilin Yingcheng Coal Mine

    Xinhua News Agency Changchun dispatch: The employees of Yingcheng Coal Mine in Jilin Province have launched a vigorous upsurge of production increase and thrift competition. The form of the competition is pit-to-pit, section-to-section, group-to-group, job-to-job, interlinking, and mutual comparison of energy.

    Six production pits first launched a hooking race. The employees of No. 8 pit proposed to compare with No. 7 pit. No. 7 pit immediately responded to the challenge. On the first day of the competition - August 25, No. 8 pit first surpassed No. 7 pit with a production performance of 1,140 tons per day. The employees of No. 7 pit immediately sent representatives to No. 8 pit to congratulate them on the second day, expressing their intention to catch up with them on that day. In order to catch up with and surpass No. 8 pit on that day, the employees of No. 7 pit conscientiously summarized the experience of the previous day, and found that the poor quality of the chute laying was the key factor affecting production. Therefore, the mine's leading cadres personally grasped the laying of the chute and established a professional team, so that the chute quickly operated normally. As a result, the entire mine surpassed No. 8 pit with a new performance of 1,153 tons of raw coal per day on the 26th.

    The head-to-head competition between the coal mining teams also carried out vigorously. Zhao Shushan team of 901 coal mining team and Li Yuting team of 902 coal mining team launched a head-to-head competition with the condition of 200 cars per shift. On the first day of the competition - August 25, Zhao Shushan team actually achieved 200 cars per shift, while Li Yuting team only produced 158 cars of coal. If calculated according to the original plan, the output of Li Yuting team has already doubled, and they should report the good news to the Party newspaper. However, the workers of this team unanimously proposed: they will not report the good news until they achieve 200 cars and surpass Zhao Shushan team. On the second day, the attendance rate of the workers in Li Yuting team reached 98%. At the beginning of the competition, Wang Zhansan, the secretary of the general Party branch of the well, also came to the team to work with the workers. They worked together and absorbed the advanced experience of Zhao Shushan team, changing from two people pushing one car to one person pushing one car, which greatly improved efficiency. As a result, the shift output reached 201 cars on this day, surpassing the shift output of Zhao Shushan team on the first day. The competition of catching up with each other promoted the general improvement of the production level. Since the late August, the average daily production level of 85% of the coal mining teams in the mine has increased by 30% to more than one time compared with the early and mid-August.

    领导工作深入具体　劳动竞赛热火朝天
    京西鹤壁等矿煤产持续增长
    京西煤矿
    新华社讯　在今年头7个月超额完成国家煤炭采掘计划的京西矿务局，8月份又取得继续跃进的新成就，原煤产量和掘进总进尺分别超额13.3％和9％完成了国家计划。
    8月份以来，这个局所属各矿广泛发动群众检查了过去7个多月的生产情况，讨论和制定了今后的增产节约计划和完成计划的具体措施。工人们一面讨论，一面立即行动，采区与采区、工段与工段、班组与班组之间，纷纷开展了以革新技术、推广先进经验为中心的热火朝天的劳动竞赛。门头沟煤矿掘进二十四队的工人们，在竞赛中反复琢磨，改进操作，采取了“超前掏槽”的方法，掘进效率比7月份提高了30％。大台煤矿回采二段三个小组在竞赛中互相学习，一组创造了新成绩，其他组就敲锣打鼓，前去祝贺、取经，然后在本组推广，结果组组超产，全月共为国家多生产了一千九百七十八吨煤。
    在运动中，这个局还抽调了三百七十六名干部充实生产第一线，参加劳动，及时解决职工在讨论增产节约计划中提出的问题。各矿还大力改进生产管理，在工人中推行“工种负责制”“劳动卡片”等群众管理制度，进一步发挥了职工的生产积极性和创造性。
    鹤壁煤矿
    据新华社郑州电　河南省鹤壁煤矿8月份获得生产大面积丰产。全矿在8月28日提前三天超额完成了8月份原煤生产计划；掘进总进度比上月同期提高12.6％，全员工效超过国家规定的指标26％。
    鹤壁煤矿今年1至7月份的煤炭产量已经完成了全年计划的76％。在这大好的形势下，全矿职工8月份以来普遍检查了前七个月的生产情况，讨论了今后几个月的增产节约计划和制订了具体措施。各个掌子面，各队、组，一直到各个人都安排了每季每月每旬每日的生产指标和提出了实现这些指标的措施。
    各矿职工一边讨论一边行动，掀起了增产煤炭的新高潮。陈家庄矿职工开展了多出煤、出好煤的“生产运动会”和班、组、个人之间的劳动竞赛，使8月以来的平均日产量比7月同期提高了8.7％左右。豆马庄二号井职工积极革新采煤方法，使原煤回采率由60％提高到80％以上，日产煤量由五百吨上升到八百多吨，坑木消耗也大大降低。
    阜新海州露天矿
    新华社阜新电　阜新煤矿海州露天煤矿职工8月份比国家计划多增产了五万八千多吨原煤。
    8月份，是多雨的季节，对露天采煤不利。但是，海州露天矿职工为了夺得煤炭高产，早就进行了防雨防汛的准备工作，如修筑防水工程，增加排水设备，加固线路基础，检查防雷措施等，因而做到了大雨不停产，小雨夺高产。
    全矿各级领导干部实行井下办公后，深入生产第一线具体抓小组工作，切切实实解决生产中的关键问题，也促进了生产的持续上升。
    山东新博煤矿
    新华社济南电　山东淄博新博煤矿已在25日超额1％提前完成8月份的产煤计划；主要巷道掘进平均日进尺比计划提高2.5％；原煤含矸率、坑木消耗量分别比计划降低19.3％和2.6％。
    新博煤矿职工8月份以来，认真检查和总结了今年头7个月的生产情况，讨论制订今后的增产节约计划，大大鼓舞了职工们的干劲。这个矿还针对运输能力不足的关键，改革了运输系统。冯家林小井的提升系统经过改革后，提升能力提高了67％。
    为了争取9月份的高产，现在这个矿已经准备好了四个工作面；同时，对运煤机、截煤机等设备进行了全面检修，并且修整了四百多米长的巷道。
    山西轩岗煤矿
    新华社太原电　山西省轩岗煤矿职工千方百计地增产煤炭，到8月30日全矿已提前一天超额完成了8月份国家原煤生产计划。全月原煤生产量比7月份增长5％。
    轩岗煤矿所产的煤，全部是炼焦煤，供应着上海、湖北、江苏、浙江、福建等地的重点钢铁企业。进入8月，矿务局党委认真发动群众，把全矿月、旬、日的生产计划，都交给工人进行了讨论，每个生产小组、每个工人都订出了自己每旬每日的生产指标，并且开展了坑与坑、班与班、组与组之间的竞赛。
    在竞赛运动中，全矿职工针对生产关键采取了许多具体措施。他们对各采掘工作面的生产能力进行了调查，着重加强了主要巷道的开拓。全矿还抽调了五百多名原调离生产岗位的老技术工人、生产班组长和部分干部，深入采掘工作面，加强了生产第一线。矿党委实行井下办公制度，及时发现和解决生产中的问题，有效地保证了计划提前完成。
    吉林营城煤矿
    新华社长春电　吉林省营城煤矿职工掀起了增产节约竞赛热潮。竞赛形式是井口对井口，段对段，组对组，工种对工种，互相挂钩，互比干劲。
    六个生产井口首先展开了挂钩赛。八井职工提出要和七井比比看。七井立即应战。竞赛开始的第一天——8月25日，八井以日产一千一百四十吨的生产成绩，首先超过了七井。七井职工第二天就派代表到八井祝贺，表示要在这一天撵上他们。七井职工为了在当天撵上并超过八井，认真地总结了前一天的经验，并且找出了溜子铺设质量不好是影响产量的关键。于是，井的领导干部亲自抓铺设溜子，成立了专业队，使溜子很快正常运转，结果全井26日以日产原煤一千一百五十三吨的新成绩撵过了八井。
    各采煤队之间的对手竞赛，也开展得轰轰烈烈。九零一采煤队赵树山小组同九零二采煤队李玉廷小组，都以班产二百车为条件开展了对手赛。竞赛第一天——8月25日，赵树山小组实际班产量达到了二百车，李玉廷小组只产煤一百五十八车。如果按原来的计划计算，李玉廷小组的产量已经翻了一番，应该向党报捷；但是这个小组的工人们一致提出：不实现二百车，不超过赵树山小组，就不报捷。第二天，李玉廷小组的工人出勤率达到了98％。竞赛一开始，井党总支书记王占三也来到小组，同工人们一起劳动。他们同心协力，并且吸取了赵树山小组的先进经验，把过去两个人推一车改为一个人推一车，大大提高了效率。结果，这一天班产量达到了二百零一车，撵过了赵树山小组头一天的班产量。你追我赶的竞赛，促进了生产水平的普遍提高。8月下旬以来，全矿有85％的采煤队的平均日产水平，比8月上、中旬增长了30％到一倍以上。
