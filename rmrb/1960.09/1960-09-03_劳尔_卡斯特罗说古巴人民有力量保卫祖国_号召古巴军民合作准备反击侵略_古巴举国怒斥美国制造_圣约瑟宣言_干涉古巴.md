Xinhua News Agency, Havana, September 1st. Revolutionary Armed Forces Minister Raúl Castro today called on workers to strengthen the militia, maintain vigilance, and work closely with the Rebel Army to repel enemy attacks at the closing ceremony of the National Sugar Workers' Federation Congress.

Raúl Castro emphasized that in order to cope with any unexpected event in any environment, it is very important to raise political awareness. He also called on workers to increase production and strengthen the unity of the working class.

Speaking of the support given by the Soviet Union when Cuba was faced with the threat of American aggression, he said that the Cuban people accept and thank the Soviet Union for its selfless assistance, but our enemies had better understand that we rely first and foremost on the strength of the Cuban people themselves. Regardless of the number of weapons, we have resisted, and regardless of whether we have the support of Soviet rockets, we have defended our homeland.

He condemned the resolutions of the Organization of American States Foreign Ministers' Conference to interfere in Cuba. He said, "We never thought that the Organization of American States would guarantee the rights of Cubans." He emphasized that in the face of this organization's hypocritical exploitative "Pan-Americanism," Cuba will hold high the banner of revolutionary Latin America.

He refuted the U.S.'s fabricated claim of "interference from outside the continent" and condemned the U.S. for interfering everywhere. He pointed out that the United States is exerting pressure through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to prevent Western European countries from selling weapons to Cuba, and the United States is also interfering everywhere in Taiwan, Korea, Japan and other places.

He condemned the United States for training Cuban war criminals at the Guantánamo Caimanera Naval Base. He said that Guantánamo will eventually be returned to Cuba.

He warned that the enemy should know that there are still 600 American companies in Cuba. "Let those who howl, howl, the Cuban revolution will never retreat a step."

He emphasized that any aggressor who dares to set foot on Cuban soil will either die on the battlefield or be shot while kneeling. He concluded, "We will win because we represent a just cause."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, September 1st. Cuban Foreign Minister Roa said in a television speech tonight that the so-called "Declaration of San José," which the United States forced the Organization of American States Foreign Ministers' Conference to adopt, will have the effect of uniting the people of Latin American countries. He said that the people of all countries will stand with Cuba.

Roa pointed out that the "Declaration of San José" was passed under the direction of U.S. imperialism. He said, "If it is illegal for the Organization of American States to maintain relations with socialist countries, then Cuba commits this crime."

Roa then condemned the U.S. government as a servant of American monopoly organizations, and Herter himself as someone who sold himself to these monopoly organizations. Roa said that Herter's tactics are reminiscent of Hitler's methods.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 30th. The Cuban public is angrily protesting against U.S. imperialism's forcing the Organization of American States Foreign Ministers' Conference to pass resolutions interfering in Cuba, attempting to replay the Guatemalan incident in Cuba and threatening the American continent.

The Cuban Revolutionary Directorate issued a statement yesterday afternoon condemning that "the imperialist Costa Rican resolution is the result of a series of aggressions against our country, and this resolution is not only aimed at our country, but also poses a serious threat to the continent."

The statement pointed out that the only interference and aggression in the Americas is U.S. imperialism. The statement emphasized that the shameful Costa Rican resolution is far from weakening the Cuban revolution and the strength of the Latin American people. After the Costa Rican conference, Cuba became a huge moral weapon in Latin America, which bravely and justly reaffirmed its national sovereignty.

The Revolutionary Directorate called on the Cuban people to maintain solid unity, further enhance vigilance and consolidate the revolution, in order to oppose the imperialist threats and military aggression that the Costa Rican resolution will inevitably lead to, and prepare for all necessary struggles to punish all invaders who set foot on our territory with imperialist and oppressive intentions. The statement also expressed unwavering support for the revolutionary government.

The National Shoe Workers' Congress passed a resolution yesterday condemning the U.S. interference in Cuba through the Organization of American States Foreign Ministers' Conference. The congress decided to raise revolutionary awareness and strengthen the militia in order to oppose any force that invades Cuba. The congress also decided to express its gratitude to socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, China, Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic for their assistance to Cuba, believing that this assistance has helped Cuba overcome difficulties and resist U.S. imperialist economic retaliation.

The Cuban Workers' Federation held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon and decided to mobilize the country to express the Cuban people's anger and protest against the interventionist resolutions of San José. At the same time, it has sent telegrams to trade unions around the world, calling on workers in various countries to support Cuba against U.S. interference. The telegram said that U.S. imperialist aggression is not only against Cuba, but against all the people of Latin America.

The Secretary-General of the National Sugar Workers' Federation, Baker, said, "The working class is now united more than ever in supporting the revolutionary government in the struggle against all kinds of aggressions by U.S. imperialism."

The Cuban Movement for Peace and National Sovereignty, the National Unity Movement, the Cuban Telephone Workers' Union Federation, the University Students' Federation, the Middle School Students' Federation, and the National Educators' Association have all protested against U.S. interference in Cuba.

It is reported that at the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo, Cuba, when the news of the "Declaration of San José" passed by the American Foreign Ministers Conference spread, tens of thousands of people ran to the streets, held demonstrations and mass meetings, supporting the Cuban delegation's attitude of withdrawing from the American Foreign Ministers Conference, and condemned the interventionist and aggressive resolutions imposed by U.S. imperialism.

    劳尔·卡斯特罗强调指出，为了能够在任何环境下应付任何意外事件，提高政治觉悟是十分重要的。他还号召工人增加生产和加强工人阶级的团结。
    他谈到苏联在古巴面临美国的侵略威胁时给予的支持，他说，古巴人民接受并感谢苏联大公无私的援助，但是我们的敌人最好要明白，我们首先依靠古巴人民自己的力量。不管武器的多少我们已经进行了抵抗，不管有没有苏联火箭的支持，我们已经进行了保卫祖国的工作。
    他谴责美洲国家组织外长会议干涉古巴的决议。他说，“我们从来不认为美洲国家组织会保证古巴人的权利。”他强调说，面对这个组织的虚伪的剥削者的“泛美主义”，古巴将高高举起革命的拉丁美洲的旗帜。
    他驳斥美国所捏造的“来自大陆以外的干涉”的说法，并且谴责美国到处进行干涉。他指出，美国通过北大西洋公约组织施加压力，使西欧国家不卖武器给古巴，美国还在台湾、朝鲜、日本等地到处干着干涉的勾当。

    他警告说，敌人要知道，在古巴还有六百个美国企业。“让那些嚎叫的人去嚎叫吧，古巴革命决不后退一步”。

    罗亚指出，“圣约瑟宣言”是在美帝国主义指使下通过的。他说，“假如对美洲国家组织来说，与社会主义国家保持关系是犯法的话，古巴就犯这个法”。
    罗亚接着谴责美国政府是美国垄断组织的仆从，而赫脱本人只是一个卖身投靠这些垄断组织的人物。罗亚说，赫脱的策略使人想起了希特勒的手法。
    新华社哈瓦那30日电　古巴公众愤怒地抗议美帝国主义强使美洲国家组织外长会议通过干涉古巴的决议，企图在古巴重演危地马拉事件和威胁美洲大陆。

    声明指出，美洲唯一的干涉和侵略势力是美帝国主义。声明强调指出，可耻的哥斯达黎加的决议远不能削弱古巴革命和拉丁美洲人民的力量，在哥斯达黎加会议后，古巴成了拉丁美洲巨大的道义上的武器，它勇敢和正当地重申了自己的国家主权。
    革命指导委员会号召古巴人民保持巩固的团结，更加提高警惕和巩固革命，以便反对哥斯达黎加决议必然导致的帝国主义的威胁和军事侵略，并准备进行一切必要的斗争，惩罚一切抱着帝国主义的和压迫的目的踏上我国领土的入侵者。声明还表示坚定不移地支持革命政府。
    全国鞋业工人代表大会昨天通过一项决议，谴责美国通过美洲国家组织外长会议对古巴进行的干涉行动。大会决定提高革命觉悟和加强民兵，以便反对侵略古巴的任何力量。大会还决定对苏联、中国、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国等社会主义国家对古巴的援助表示感谢，认为这种援助帮助了古巴克服困难和抵抗美帝国主义的经济报复。
    古巴工人联合会昨天下午召开了紧急会议，决定在全国进行动员，以便表示古巴全体人民对圣约瑟的干涉性的决议的愤怒的抗议。同时它已经致电世界各国工会，呼吁各国的劳动者支援古巴反对美国的干涉。电报说，美帝国主义的进攻不仅是为了反对古巴，而且是为了反对拉丁美洲全体人民。
    全国糖业工人联合会总书记贝克说，“工人阶级现在在支持革命政府反对美帝国主义的各种各样的侵略斗争中空前地团结起来了。”
    古巴争取和平与各国人民主权运动、全国团结运动、古巴电话工人工会联合会、大学生联合会、中学生联合会以及全国教育工作者协会都表示抗议美国对古巴的干涉。
    据报道，在美国在古巴的海军基地关塔那摩，当美洲外长会议通过“圣约瑟宣言”的消息传开时，成千上万的人跑到街上，举行示威游行和召开群众大会，支持古巴代表团退出美洲国家组织外长会议的态度，并且谴责由美帝国主义强加的干涉性和侵略性的决议。
