    How to Prevent Early Frost

    Frost damage refers to a kind of disastrous weather in which, during the crop growing season, the temperature drops to around 0 degrees Celsius, causing damage or death to crops.

    Frost is mostly generated along with the southward movement of cold air. Therefore, generally, the night after a cold wave, with clear, windless weather, is the most likely time for frost damage to occur.

    Judging from the average situation over the years, the first frost in China appears in the middle and late September in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia regions; the first frost in the North China Plain and Guanzhong area generally occurs in the middle and late October; the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River enter the frost season in late November and early December; and the first frost south of the Nanling Mountains is postponed to late December. The timing of the frost appearance is also closely related to geographical terrain; coastal areas are relatively late, while plateaus and low-lying areas are earlier.

    The harm caused by frost to crops is due to the formation of ice crystals from the water in the intercellular spaces of plant cells under low-temperature conditions, which destroys the cell tissue and prevents metabolism from taking place, thus causing damage and death to the crops. The severity of frost damage to crops depends on the intensity, suddenness, and duration of the frost. Different crop varieties and different stages of development have different degrees of cold resistance. To overcome the harm of frost, it is necessary to conduct specific research and treat the problem differently, combining the specific conditions of the local area, the time, and the crop. Generally speaking, the key to frost prevention is to improve the cold resistance of crops and increase the temperature of the crop field to prevent it from dropping to the point where frost occurs, based on timely frost forecasts. There are many methods of frost prevention, and the following are commonly used:

    Covering method: Before the arrival of frost, cover crops with grass and other materials to keep them warm and prevent frost. This method has a good effect and is suitable for economic crops with short plants, such as vegetables. However, this method requires a lot of labor and is not suitable for large-scale application.

    Irrigation method: The day before the frost, irrigate the crop fields to prevent the near-surface temperature of the field from dropping rapidly. This is a very good frost prevention method and can be used on a large scale in areas with sufficient water sources.

    Smoke screen frost prevention: Using burning straw and other materials to generate a large amount of smoke to increase the temperature in the field and reduce ground radiation is a widely used method. Last year, the masses in Henan created frost prevention cannons, using chemical drugs to generate smoke screens, which had a very good effect and are currently being widely promoted.

    Improving crop cultivation methods: Such as selecting cold-resistant varieties, timely sowing, and applying reasonable phosphorus and potassium fertilizers to promote early maturity, is also an effective measure to prevent frost.

    怎样预防早霜
    霜冻是指在作物生长的季节里，温度下降到摄氏零度左右，使作物受害或死亡的一种灾害性天气。
    霜冻多是伴随着冷空气南下而产生的。所以一般在寒潮过后的一天内，夜间晴朗、无风的天气，最容易出现霜冻。
    我国的初霜冻，就历年平均情况来看，东北、内蒙古地区大致出现在9月中下旬；华北平原和关中地区初霜冻一般在10月中、下旬；长江中下游11月下旬和12月上旬进入霜期；五岭以南的初霜冻要推迟到12月下旬。霜冻出现的早晚与地理地形也很有关系，滨海地区相对地较晚，高原和低洼地较早。
    霜冻对作物造成的危害，是由于在低温条件下，使作物体细胞间隙的水分形成冰晶，破坏了细胞的组织，使新陈代谢作用不能进行而引起作物受害和死亡。霜冻对作物危害的轻重，决定于霜冻的强度、突然性和持续时间。各种作物品种不同、发育期不同，耐寒的程度也不一样。要战胜霜冻的危害，需结合当地、当时和作物的具体情况，具体研究，分别对待。一般地说，及时根据霜冻预报，设法提高作物的抗寒能力和提高保持作物田间的温度，使之不降低到出现霜冻的程度，是防霜的关键所在。防霜的方法很多，普遍采用的有这样几种：
    复盖法：在霜冻来临前，用草和其他东西遮盖作物，以保温防霜。这种方法效果很好，适用于蔬菜等植株矮小的经济作物。但这种方法花费劳力较多，不适于大面积采用。
    灌水法：在霜冻前一天，将作物田间灌水，使田间近地层温度不至于很快下降。这是一种很好的防霜方法，在水源充足的地区可以大面积采用。
    烟幕防霜：利用燃烧蒿秆等产生大量的烟幕，以增加田间温度，减少地面辐射，这是目前广泛采用的一种方法。去年河南群众创造了防霜炮，利用化学药品，产生烟幕，效果很好，目前正在大量推广。
    改进作物的栽培方法：如选用抗寒品种、适时播种，合理施用磷钾肥料，促进早熟，也是防御霜冻的一种有效措施。
