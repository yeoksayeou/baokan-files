Xinhua News Agency, Havana, September 5th: Massive rallies were held yesterday in various parts of Oriente Province, Cuba, to express fervent support for the "Declaration of Havana" passed at the Cuban People's National Assembly in Havana last Friday.

The 850,000 workers, peasants, students, militiamen, self-employed individuals, and people from all walks of life who participated in the rallies in Santiago, Manzanillo, and Holguin enthusiastically and unanimously agreed, with thunderous cheers, to answer the so-called "Declaration of San Jose," which the U.S. State Department imposed on Latin American countries, with the "Declaration of Havana." They also continuously shouted slogans such as "Cuba yes, Yankees no!" and "Down with U.S. Imperialism!"

Half a million people participated in the Santiago rally. Participants carried signs with slogans such as: "We support the establishment of relations with socialist countries," "Yankee Go Home from Cuba!" and "The Organization of American States is an organization of American exploiters."

Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Olivares, speaking at the rally, said that the "Declaration of San Jose," which the United States forced the Costa Rican Foreign Ministers' Conference to adopt, was an attempt to isolate Cuba from the people of other American countries. The "Declaration of Havana," however, signifies the fraternal unity of Cuba and the people of other Latin American countries. He said that in response to the foolish "anti-communist" prejudices incited by the "Declaration of San Jose," the "Declaration of Havana" advocates the establishment of relations with all countries in the world. Olivares emphasized that the "Declaration of San Jose" meant seeking support for the puppet regime in Taiwan, while the "Declaration of Havana" recognized the People's Republic of China. He pointed out that the "Declaration of Havana" was adopted when the Cuban people were dedicating themselves to defending their sovereignty and burying imperialism. The "Declaration of Havana" was read out at the meeting. When the passage stating the establishment of relations with the People's Republic of China was read, enthusiastic cheers erupted from the crowd. Representatives of various trade union organizations handed over to the conference funds raised for the purchase of weapons and aircraft.

At the rally of 100,000 people in Manzanillo, Major Armando Acosta stated that the rebel army supported the "Declaration of Havana." He said that the Cuban people were prepared to sacrifice their lives to defend their motherland and fight against U.S. imperialist aggressors.

A mass rally of 250,000 people was held in Holguin to support the "Declaration of Havana." Montesino emphasized at the meeting that the people of Latin American countries must unite to liberate themselves from the rule of U.S. imperialism, which is exploiting them. After the meeting, militiamen held high fluttering national flags and held a grand parade accompanied by the Cuban national anthem.

    古巴85万人集会拥护“哈瓦那宣言”
    与会群众热烈欢呼中古建交坚决反对美国侵略
    新华社哈瓦那5日电　古巴奥连特省各地昨天举行了盛大的集会，表示热烈拥护上星期五在哈瓦那古巴人民全国大会上通过的“哈瓦那宣言”。
    在圣地亚哥、曼萨尼罗和奥尔金分别参加集会的八十五万工人、农民、学生、民兵、自由职业者和其他各界人民热情横溢，他们以雷鸣般的欢呼声表示一致同意以“哈瓦那宣言”来回答美国国务院强加于拉丁美洲国家的所谓“圣约瑟宣言”，并且不断高呼“要古巴，不要美国佬”，“打倒美帝国主义”等口号。
    有五十万人参加了圣地亚哥的集会，参加集会的人携带着这样的标语牌：“我们拥护和社会主义国家建立关系”、“山姆大叔从古巴滚出去！”、“美洲国家组织是美洲剥削者的组织”。
    古巴外交部副部长卡洛斯·奥利瓦雷斯在集会上讲话时说，美国强使哥斯达黎加外长会议通过的“圣约瑟宣言”是企图使古巴在其他美洲国家人民中孤立起来，“哈瓦那宣言”却意味着古巴和其他拉丁美洲国家人民的兄弟般的团结。他说，针对“圣约瑟宣言”所煽动的愚蠢的“反共”偏见，“哈瓦那宣言”主张同全世界所有的国家建立关系。奥利瓦雷斯强调指出，“圣约瑟宣言”意味着为台湾的傀儡政权寻找支持，而“哈瓦那宣言”承认了中华人民共和国。他指出，“哈瓦那宣言”是当古巴人民献身于卫护他们的主权和为帝国主义送丧的时候通过的。会上宣读了“哈瓦那宣言”，当读到“哈瓦那宣言”中表示和中华人民共和国建立关系的一段时，人群中爆发了热烈的欢呼声。各个工会组织的代表向大会交出了为购买武器和飞机而募捐的基金。
    在曼萨尼罗十万人的大会上，阿曼多·阿科斯塔少校表示起义军拥护“哈瓦那宣言”。他说，古巴人民准备为保卫祖国和反对美帝国主义侵略者而牺牲生命。
    在奥尔金举行有二十五万人参加的支持“哈瓦那宣言”的群众集会。蒙特森伊在会上强调指出，拉丁美洲各国人民必须团结起来，从剥削他们的美帝国主义的统治下解放自己。大会结束后民兵们高举着迎风招展的国旗，在古巴国歌的伴奏下举行了盛大的游行。
