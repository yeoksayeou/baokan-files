Xinhua News Agency, Luanda, 31st dispatch: Inspired by the patriotic struggle of the Congolese people, the Angolan people's anti-colonialist struggle is rising day by day. Residents of the city of Ghibala in Angola have recently demanded that the Portuguese colonialists get out.

Reports say that Angolan farmers opposing colonial rule are refusing to work on plantations run by colonialists. The "Angolan People's Union" has protested to the Portuguese government about its policy of "genocide" in Angola.

News also said that fearing that the Angolan people's anti-colonialist struggle would experience a new upsurge under the inspiration of the Congolese national independence movement, the Portuguese government had already dispatched a so-called "special punitive force" to land in Luanda, the capital of Angola, in mid-June, and dispatched special police to strengthen control of the border between Angola and the Congo.

At the same time, the Portuguese colonial authorities are stepping up suppression activities. In Luanda, fully armed colonial police patrol the streets all night in jeeps. In Nova Lisboa, three hundred miles southeast of Luanda, the colonial authorities have banned Angolan people from holding gatherings of more than three people.

News from Leopoldville, Congo, said that the "Congo Newspaper" recently published an appeal from an Angolan nationalist calling for Angola to be liberated from Portuguese occupation. The appeal stated that Portuguese colonialism is the most backward and barbaric colonialism.

    新华社31日讯　卢安达消息：在刚果人民爱国斗争的鼓舞下，安哥拉人民反殖民主义斗争日益高涨。安哥拉的吉巴拉城居民最近要求葡萄牙殖民者滚出去。
    消息说，反对殖民统治的安哥拉农民拒绝在殖民者经营的种植园里工作。“安哥拉人民联盟”已经向葡萄牙政府就它在安哥拉执行的“种族灭绝”政策提出抗议。
    消息还说，由于害怕安哥拉人民的反殖民主义斗争在刚果民族独立运动的鼓舞下会出现新的高涨，葡萄牙政府已经在6月中旬派遣一支所谓“特别讨伐队”在安哥拉首府卢安达登陆，并且出动特别警察，加强控制安哥拉同刚果接壤的边界。
    同时，葡萄牙殖民当局正在加紧进行镇压活动。在卢安达，全副武装的殖民警察乘着吉普车，通宵进行巡逻。在离开卢安达东南三百英里的诺瓦利日博厄，殖民当局禁止安哥拉人民举行三人以上的集会。
    来自刚果利奥波德维尔的消息说，“刚果报”最近刊载了一位安哥拉民族主义者的呼吁书，要求安哥拉从葡萄牙占领下解放出来。呼吁书说，葡萄牙殖民主义者是最落后和最蛮横的殖民主义。
