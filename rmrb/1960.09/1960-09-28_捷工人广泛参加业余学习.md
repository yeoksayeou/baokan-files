Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 27th: Czechoslovak workers are widely participating in spare-time study to improve their cultural and technical levels.

　　This year, in the major industrial systems alone, 280,000 workers are engaged in spare-time study in factory-run schools, various training courses, middle schools, or specialized schools. This is almost equivalent to one-fifth of the total number of workers. In addition, 20,000 workers have enrolled in spare-time industrial university programs.

　　More than 40% of the employees of the Kladno Coal Mine are engaged in study. In the Chemosvit factory in Svit, Slovakia, almost all workers have improved their technical levels through spare-time study.

　　At the ČKD Dukla Machine Manufacturing Plant in Prague, 20% of the workers have been tested and proven to have improved their technical level this year. František Spán, a thirty-six-year-old worker at this factory, graduated this summer with excellent grades from the six-year Electrical Industrial University after completing ten years of spare-time study. He currently manages the power machinery of a large workshop in the factory.

　　Generally speaking, workers progress faster in their studies than ordinary students. This is because workers have richer production and practical experience.

　　The Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government attach great importance to workers' spare-time study. All factories, enterprises, and educational institutions fully support their spare-time study. With the development of workers' spare-time study, the number of workers studying part-time in certain specialized schools has exceeded the number of ordinary students. For example, in the Prague Architectural Industrial School, thirty-three of the forty-six classes are spare-time classes for workers. Some larger factories or local people's committees have begun to establish two- to three-year workers' spare-time middle schools for young workers who have completed apprentice schools since last year. Due to the widespread demand from young workers, there are currently 137 such classes nationwide.

　　捷工人广泛参加业余学习
    新华社布拉格27日电　捷克斯洛伐克工人广泛地参加了业余学习，以提高文化和技术水平。
    今年，仅在主要工业系统中就有二十八万名工人在工厂办的学校、各种训练班、中学或专科学校等进行业余学习，这差不多相当于工人总数的五分之一。此外，还有二万名工人报名参加了工业大学的业余学习。
    克拉德诺煤矿40％以上的职工都在进行学习。在斯洛伐克地区斯维特地方的赫莫斯维特工厂，几乎全体工人都通过业余学习提高了技术水平。
    布拉格的捷卡德—杜克拉机器制造厂，今年已有20％的工人经过测验，证明技术水平有了提高。这个工厂的三十六岁的工人弗朗齐歇克·斯潘在完成了十年的业余学习后，今年暑期以优秀的成绩在六年制电气工业大学毕业。目前，他管理着工厂一个大车间的动力机械。
    工人们在学习上一般说来比普通学生进步得快。这是由于工人们都具有较丰富的生产和实际经验。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府很重视工人的业余学习。各工厂企业和教育机关全力支持他们的业余学习。随着工人业余学习的开展，某些专科学校的工人业余学习人数超过了普通学生。如布拉格建筑工业学校的四十六个班中，有三十三个班是工人业余学习班。一些较大的工厂或地方人民委员会从去年开始为已上完学徒学校的青年工人创办了二到三年的工人业余中学。由于青年工人的广泛要求，目前全国此类学校共有一百三十七个班。
