Carry forward the spirit of hard work and plain living of the revolutionary war period
Baode County cadres and the masses are intimately related

    (Our report) Baode County, Shanxi Province, a revolutionary old base area, has cadres who carry forward the fine traditions of the Party's hard work, plain living, diligence and thrift. They regularly go deep into reality, deep into the masses, share weal and woe with the masses, and are loved and supported by the people of the whole county.
    Baode County is a loess hilly area in northwestern Shanxi, with barren land. The broad masses of cadres continue to carry forward the spirit of hard work and simplicity of the Anti-Japanese War period. They go wherever there are difficulties and share food, housing, labor, and discussions with the masses, "fighting against the sky and demanding grain from the land," overcoming various disasters and ensuring a bumper harvest. The local people call them "the apple of our eye" and "old Eighth Route Army on the mountain."
    No matter what difficulties they face, the cadres of Baode County always stand at the forefront, lead the masses forward by setting an example. In July last year, Zhaizishan in Cao Hu Commune suffered a severe hail disaster, and the harvest seemed hopeless. Hu Shuitong, the secretary of the Party Committee, led the cadres with seeds on their backs, rushing there overnight. While helping the masses arrange their lives, they worked with the commune members to turn the land, scoop up manure, and rush to plant vegetables and replant late autumn crops. Through production and self-rescue, the lives of the masses were not greatly affected. The masses happily said: "Good cadres educated by Chairman Mao are our saviors." On another occasion, a flash flood broke out, and the flood flooded houses near Chengguan. The office cadres helped the masses move their homes in the flood day and night, and took the initiative to vacate their houses for the masses to live in, which moved the masses very much. Usually, wherever the vast number of cadres go, they eat and work there. Work during the day and work at night, or work in the morning and work in the afternoon, and insist on living and working with the masses. In the past few years, the five county party secretaries and fourteen county party committee members of Baode County have always insisted on implementing a system of spending 70% of their time in the countryside and 30% of their time in meetings and studying in the office. Since the implementation of the "two-five system," more than 98% of the cadres and the masses in the county have insisted on eating, living, working, and discussing together. As of the end of July, the average number of workdays done by cadres working in the county offices was more than 60, and the average number of workdays done by cadres who often went to the countryside and grassroots cadres was more than 100.
    Because cadres go deep into reality and deep into the masses, the relationship between cadres and the masses is intimate and seamless. The masses take the initiative and enthusiastically talk to the cadres about their inner thoughts and let the cadres help solve problems. The masses also take care of the cadres meticulously. When they see that the kang where the cadres sleep is cold, they burn the kang for them; if the accommodation is not good, they vacate their own houses for them to live in. The relationship between cadres and the masses is intimate and seamless.
    In terms of lifestyle, the cadres throughout the county have always maintained the fine traditions of diligence, thrift, hard work, simplicity, and selflessness. Cadres at all levels in the county sweep the yards, fetch water, and deliver letters themselves. Because the cadres can do this, the county-level organs alone have vacated thirteen clerical messengers and established a farm in Hejiashan, reclaiming more than 600 mu of land. The county party committee organs from the secretary to the general cadres personally acted as breeders, raising a total of eighteen pigs in seven months. The county party committee originally had two horses for leading cadres to ride when going to the countryside. Later, considering the country's need for horses, the horses were given to support production and construction. From then on, no matter whether it was the secretary or the county magistrate who went to the countryside, they carried their bedding and left just like everyone else. In addition to daily expenses and subscriptions to books and newspapers, the cadres deposited the surplus money in the bank every month. The frugality of the leading cadres in life has become an example for the masses to learn from. (Attached picture)

    发扬革命战争时期的艰苦朴素作风
    保德县干部和群众亲密无间
    本报讯　革命老根据地山西省保德县干部发扬党的艰苦朴素克勤克俭的优良作风，经常深入实际，深入群众，与群众同甘共苦，受到全县人民的拥护和爱戴。
    保德县是晋西北的一个黄土丘陵区，土地贫瘠。广大干部继续发扬了过去抗日战争时期那种艰苦朴素的作风，那里有困难就到那里，和群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，“与天斗争，向地要粮”，战胜了各种灾害的袭击，保证了丰收。当地群众称他们是“自己的心上人”，“山上的老八路”。
    保德县干部不论在任何困难面前，总是站在最前列，以身作则，带领群众前进。去年7月，曹虎公社寨子山受了严重的雹灾，眼看收成无望，党委书记胡水同就带领干部背着种籽星夜赶去，一面帮助群众安排生活，一面同社员一起翻地、掏粪，突击种菜和补种晚秋作物，经过生产自救，群众生活没有受到大影响。群众高兴地说：“毛主席教育下的好干部是我们的救命恩人。”又一次，山洪暴发，洪水漫了城关附近的房子，机关干部就没明没黑地在洪水中帮助群众搬家，并且主动腾出房子让群众居住，群众很受感动。平时，广大干部走到那里，就吃在那里，劳动在那里。白天劳动，晚上工作，或者上午劳动，下午工作，坚持同群众一起生活，一起劳动。几年来，保德县的五个县委书记和十四个县委委员一直坚持实行70％的时间下乡、30％的时间在机关开会和学习的制度。推行“二五制”以来，全县98％以上的干部和群众坚持同吃同住同劳动同商量。截至7月底，全县在机关工作的干部平均每人做劳动日六十个以上，经常下乡的干部和基层干部平均每人做劳动日一百个以上。
    由于干部深入实际深入群众，使干部和群众的关系亲密无间，群众都主动热情地向干部谈自己的心里话，让干部帮助解决问题。群众对干部的照顾也是无微不至，看见干部睡的炕冷了，就给烧炕；住的不好，就把自己的房子腾出来，干部和群众亲密无间。
    在生活作风方面，全县干部始终保持克勤克俭，艰苦朴素，大公无私的优良传统。全县各级干部自己扫院、打水、送信。由于干部都能这样做，仅县级机关就腾出了十三个事务通讯员，到贺家山办起了农场，开荒种地六百多亩。县委机关从书记到一般干部亲自当饲养员，七个月共养猪十八口，县委原来有两匹马，供领导干部下乡时骑用。后来考虑到国家需要马，就把马支援了生产建设。从那以后，不论书记还是县长下乡，都和大家一样背着铺盖说走就走。干部每月的工资，除了日常费用和订阅书报杂志外，多余的钱都存入银行。领导干部生活上的俭朴，已成为群众学习的榜样。（附图片）
