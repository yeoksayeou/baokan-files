　　Welcome, Envoys of the Heroic Algerian People!
　　Lu Xiaoxiu
    We are delighted to welcome the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, headed by Prime Minister Ferhat Abbas, to our country. How can we not be happy and delighted that Prime Minister Abbas has brought the friendship of the heroic Algerian people in their national liberation struggle, and the friendship of the African people marching towards independence and freedom!

    The Algerian novelist and historian Hammet Hafiz once described Algeria in this way: The scorching desert ends at the steep mountain walls of the Deran Mountains. Beyond the peaks, large expanses of vineyards, olive groves, pastures, apricot orchards, and wheat fields suddenly appear… Behind you, the sun occasionally pierces through the clouds, cleverly illuminating the layered peaks and majestic mountains that disappear endlessly into the billowing clouds. The warm, golden sunlight nourishes this rich land of North Africa… However, the people living on this rich land are not wealthy. Landlords and capitalists, who make up less than 10% of the national population, control all the social wealth. Colonizers and a handful of dignitaries favored by the colonial authorities occupy the most fertile land along the coast, seizing 90% of the grapes, fruits, and other mineral resources. The people live in pain and hunger. In the city of Algiers, on one side are modern buildings of more than ten stories, and on the other side are narrow, dirty slums—the Casbah, where you can encounter sick, naked children and ragged pedestrians at any time.

    Who has filled this beautiful country with suffering, and who has made the people of this rich country endure hunger? As long as you look at the history of the Algerian people's struggle over the past century, you can understand that imperialism is the creator of all these evils.

    As early as more than a thousand years ago, in order to resist the brutal rule of the Romans, Vandals, and Byzantines, the Algerian people, during the time of Masinissa and Jugurtha, had already organized and devoted themselves to revolutionary struggles. On June 14, 1830, the French colonizer Charles landed on the Sidi Ferruch peninsula with more than a hundred warships and 35,000 soldiers, and occupied the capital Algiers on July 5 (to this day, people still mourn the heroic martyrs who sacrificed in this war and name July 5 as National Disaster Day). Since then, the Algerian people have groaned under the bloody suppression of the colonialists for 130 years, and the people have become the beasts of burden of imperialism! But the people will not succumb to the tyranny of imperialism. In 1871, when the working class of the Paris Commune in France raised the banner of revolution, the Algerian national hero Muhammad Mokrani organized an organization to demand independence and autonomy; massive uprisings also broke out in 1881 and 1916. In 1943, the "Friends of the Manifesto" under the leadership of Abbas united the broad masses of the people to demand the establishment of the Algerian Republic. The French arrested Abbas and imprisoned him, but were forced to release him only after the struggle of the people's general strike. In 1945, the people of Setif put forward the demands for national independence and national self-determination while celebrating the demise of fascist Germany. The imperialist military police launched a massacre against unarmed residents, with thousands of people falling in pools of blood and more than 4,000 people being arrested and imprisoned… Six years ago, in the autumn, under the leadership of the "Revolutionary Committee of Unity and Action," a general armed uprising was launched. The Algerian people have carried out a heroic armed struggle.

    Despite the fact that the French colonialists, with the help of U.S. imperialism, have used all kinds of inhuman means to massacre Algerian civilians, burn villages and forests, and carry out assassinations... over the past six years, the National Liberation Army has grown from 3,000 to about 150,000 regular troops; over the past six years, a total of 250,000 French troops have been wiped out; the liberated areas have expanded from the Aurès Mountains to vast areas accounting for two-thirds of the country. One victory after another has inspired the anti-colonialist people of the world, especially the African people. With the support of the socialist camp, the African people, and all the righteous people in the world, today the Algerian people are entering the sixth year of their arduous war of resistance.

    In the struggle for independence and freedom, the Algerian people have seen clearly the true face of U.S. imperialism, which is trying every possible means to infiltrate Africa. U.S. imperialism is not only the enemy of the people of Asia and Latin America, but also the most insidious enemy of the African people. Algerians will never forget the peaceful residents who sacrificed under the American-supplied aircraft and artillery, and they will never forget the American airports and the Mers El Kébir naval base in Algeria.

    The Algerian people are fighting. News of their victories is constantly coming from Algeria. The struggle of the Algerian people is arduous, but they are on the side of justice. They will become stronger as they fight, and the final victory will surely belong to the heroic Algerian people! Our friendship with the Algerian people is being built in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The Algerian people can see clearly who their enemies are and who their true friends are. I cannot help but remember the words of the Algerian poet Saadallah:

    "As in the past, we will continue to be kind and loving people, but we will reward the enemy with dense bullets and grant them death!"

    This is the voice of the broad masses of the Algerian people! The armed Algerian people are tightly grasping the weapons in their hands and fiercely striking the enemy!

    The beautiful and rich land of Algeria will always belong to the Algerian people. The imperialists will get nothing!

### 欢迎您，英勇的阿尔及利亚人民的使者！

　　欢迎您，英勇的阿尔及利亚人民的使者！
　　陆孝修
    以费尔哈特·阿巴斯总理为首的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团来我国访问。我们感到高兴。阿巴斯总理带来了民族解放斗争中英勇的阿尔及利亚人民的友谊；带来了走向独立与自由的非洲人民的友谊，这怎能不使我们高兴和愉快呢！
    阿尔及利亚的小说家、历史家哈姆特·哈非兹曾这样描写过阿尔及利亚：炙人的沙漠终止在德兰山峻峭的山壁下，越过峰峦，眼前突然出现了大块大块的葡萄园、橄榄园、牧场、杏林、麦田……身后，太阳不时穿过云层，巧妙地投照着层峰叠嶂，险峻雄伟的群山隐现在朵朵行云中看不到尽头，温暖的金色的阳光滋育着北非这片富饶的土地……可是生活在这片富饶土地上的人民并不富裕，不到全国人口10％的地主、资本家控制了全部的社会财富，殖民者和一小撮殖民当局宠信的显贵占有了沿海最肥沃的土地，攫取了90％的葡萄、水果以及其他矿藏物资，人民生活在痛苦和饥饿中。阿尔及尔城里，一面是十几层的现代化大厦，另一面是狭窄、肮脏的贫民区——卡斯巴，在那里你随时会遇上患病的裸体的孩子，衣衫褴褛的行人。
    是谁使这个美丽的国家满布苦难，是谁使这个富饶国家的人民忍饥挨饿？只要你看看阿尔及利亚人民近百年来的斗争史，就可以明白，帝国主义是这一切罪恶的制造者。
    早在一千多年以前，阿尔及利亚人民为了反抗罗马人、汪达尔人、拜占庭人暴戾的统治，在马西尼亚和幼格勒脱时代，就已经组织起来，投身到革命斗争中去。1830年6月14日，法国殖民者沙勒以百余艘战舰和三万五千名士兵在萨易地半岛登陆，7月5日占领了首都阿尔及尔（至今人们还沉痛地悼念着这次战争中牺牲的英雄烈士，并把7月5日命名为国难日）。此后，阿尔及利亚人民就在殖民主义者的血腥镇压下呻吟了一百三十年之久，人民成了帝国主义的牛马！可是人民不会屈服在帝国主义的淫威下。1871年当法国巴黎公社工人阶级举起革命旗帜的时候，阿尔及利亚民族英雄穆罕默德·莫克腊尼组织了一个机构要求独立、自主；1881年和1916年也相继爆发了巨大的起义运动。1943年，阿巴斯领导下的“宣言之友”团结了广大人民要求建立阿尔及利亚共和国。法国逮捕阿巴斯下狱，后在人民大罢工的斗争下，才被迫释放阿巴斯。1945年赛梯夫城人民在庆祝法西斯德国灭亡的同时，提出了民族独立、民族自决的要求，帝国主义军警竟向手无寸铁的居民展开了大屠杀，数千人倒在血泊中，四千多人被捕入狱……。六年前的秋天，在“团结与行动革命委员会”的领导下发动了武装总起义。阿尔及利亚人民进行了英勇的武装斗争。
    尽管法国殖民者在美帝国主义的帮助下，用尽一切惨无人道的手段屠杀阿尔及利亚平民，烧毁村庄、森林，进行暗杀活动……可是六年来民族解放军从三千人发展到十五万人左右的正规军；六年来共歼法军二十五万；解放区从奥雷斯山区扩大到占全国三分之二的广大地区，一个接一个的胜利的消息鼓舞着全世界反殖民主义的人民，特别是非洲人民。在社会主义阵营、非洲人民和全世界正义人民的支援下，今天阿尔及利亚人民正进入第六个年头的艰苦抗战。
    阿尔及利亚人民在争取独立自由的斗争中，看清了正千方百计地渗入非洲的美帝国主义的真面目。美帝国主义不仅是亚洲、拉丁美洲人民的敌人，也是非洲人民最阴险的敌人，阿尔及利亚人绝对忘不了牺牲在美国供给的飞机、大炮下的和平居民，也绝不忘记美国设在阿尔及利亚的机场和曼埃凯比军港。
    阿尔及利亚人民在战斗中。从阿尔及利亚不断传来他们胜利的消息；阿尔及利亚人民的斗争是艰苦的，但是，他们是站在正义的方面，他们将越战越强，最后的胜利一定属于英勇的阿尔及利亚人民！我们跟阿尔及利亚人民的友谊，正是在反帝国主义、反殖民主义的共同斗争中建立起来的。阿尔及利亚人民看得清谁是他们的敌人，谁是自己真正的朋友。我不由得记起了阿尔及利亚诗人萨阿达拉的话：
    “跟过去一样，我们还要作善良慈爱的人，但是要赏给敌人密集的枪弹，赐给他们死亡！”
    这是广大阿尔及利亚人民的心声！武装起来的阿尔及利亚人民，正紧握手中的武器狠狠地打击着敌人！
    阿尔及利亚美丽富饶的土地永远是属于阿尔及利亚人民的，帝国主义者是什么也不会得到的！
