    This newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch of the 19th: The Datong Coal Mine railway branch line has implemented a major alliance of railway and mine for requesting cars, loading cars, and dispatching cars. Over 85% of coal transport vehicles operate "one-stop" trains directly from coal mines to coal-consuming enterprises, promoting coal mine production, ensuring the needs of coal-consuming enterprises, and economically using vehicles, satisfying coal mines, railways, and coal-consuming units. From January to August this year, outbound coal transport accounted for 100% of the total raw coal production in the eight months. The time trains spend at the station has also been reduced from over a dozen hours to just over eight hours.
    The vast majority of Datong coal is transported to key steel plants, power plants, and other enterprises in other areas via Kouquan Station. The 26-kilometer branch line from Kouquan Station to Qingyangwan is a major artery for coal transportation from the Datong Coal Mine. Almost every hour, a train loaded with raw coal departs from Kouquan Station, simultaneously sending empty cars to various coal loading points. In April of this year, in order to better complete the coal transportation task, the coal mine and Kouquan Station implemented a major alliance, jointly studying and unifying command from the formulation of car request plans to the direction of car dispatch. They also formulated the principle of "railways sending empty cars based on coal mine production, coal mines loading cars in accordance with railway car dispatch, and railway car dispatch conforming to jointly formulated operation plans to ensure coal supply for key enterprises," pushing railway-mine collaboration to a new stage.
    This kind of major railway-mine alliance enables the transportation department to more actively serve production and users. Since the beginning of this year, personnel from the railway and coal mine transportation departments have regularly gone deep into the mines to understand production conditions, coal storage conditions, and loading and unloading conditions. If a mine has high production, they will proactively increase the allocation of empty cars to support it. Dispatchers also adjust car delivery and loading plans at any time based on the conditions of each mine, so as to avoid vehicle backlog or shortage. When there are sufficient empty cars, they take the opportunity to rush the transportation of stored coal. Wajinwan Mine's Qingyangwan is a newly opened coal transportation point. In the past, coal storage reached 80,000 to 90,000 tons. Through the joint efforts of the railway and mine, the stored coal was all rushed out in just one month.
    The railway and mine cooperate to operate "one-stop" direct trains from coal mines to coal-consuming enterprises, which has great benefits. It reduces the work of railway intermediate marshalling, achieves economical use of vehicles, and delivers coal to users as quickly as possible. Recently, some trains have even developed into fixed-route, fixed-time operations, fixing the departure time and destination station every day, enabling all parties to cooperate more actively with each other. In order to increase the number of such trains, the joint office makes statistics on the direction of car flow every month based on the raw coal transportation task, and takes measures such as balancing coal types and concentrating destinations when preparing the operation plan according to the needs of various places for different coal types. The Transportation and Marketing Department of the Datong Mining Bureau has also sent people to contact coal-consuming enterprises to investigate the coal-consuming enterprises' loading and unloading capacity, coal consumption time, and other information, so as to organize direct trains.
    In order to transport coal to key coal-consuming enterprises as soon as possible, the workers of the Datong Mining Bureau's mines are carrying out a technical revolution in loading and unloading, improving loading efficiency, and reducing the time trains spend at the station. In addition to the three mines with modern coal bunker loading facilities, other mines have generally adopted indigenous methods to improve loading machinery and improve loading efficiency. Doudougou, Hujiawan, Huangshiyan and other three mines have also built indigenous coal bunkers. In the past, it took more than three hours to load a train of coal, but now it only takes 30 minutes. The coal mines have also saved more than 500 coal loading workers to support the front line of production.

    大同路矿大协作运煤速度快
    前八个月产煤全部及时运出　保证了钢厂、电厂等有关企业用煤
    本报太原19日电　大同煤矿铁路支线实行要车、装车、出车的路矿大联合，85％以上的运煤车辆开行了从煤矿直达用煤企业的“一条龙”列车，促进了煤矿生产，保证了用煤企业的需要，并能经济地使用车辆，作到了煤矿、铁路、用煤单位三满意。今年1至8月，全局外运煤占到八个月原煤总产量的100％。火车在车站的停留时间，也由十几个小时减少到八个多小时。
    大同煤绝大部分经过口泉车站，运往外地重点钢铁厂、电厂等企业。从口泉车站到青羊湾全长二十六公里的支线，是大同煤矿运煤的一条大动脉，几乎每小时就有一列满载原煤的火车从口泉车站开出，同时把空车送到各个运煤点去。今年4月，为了更好地完成运煤任务，煤矿和口泉车站实行了大联合，从编制要车计划到出车流向，都共同研究，统一指挥。他们还制订了“铁路送空车从煤矿生产出发，煤矿装车服从铁路出车，铁路出车服从共同编制的作业计划，保证重点企业用煤”的发运原则，把路矿协作推向了一个新的阶段。
    这种路矿大联合，使运输部门能更主动地为生产、为用户服务。今年以来，铁路和煤矿运输部门的人员，定期深入各矿了解生产情况、存煤情况和装卸情况。哪个矿高产，他们就主动增调空车支援。调度人员还根据各矿情况随时调整送车和装车计划，以免车辆积压或不足。在空车充足的时候，他们便乘机抢运存煤。挖金湾矿青羊湾，是个新通车的运煤点，过去存煤达八、九万吨。经过路矿双方共同努力，仅一个月时间就把存煤全部突击抢运出去。
    路矿双方共同协作，开行从煤矿到用煤企业的“一条龙”直达列车，好处很大。既减少了铁路中途编组的作业，做到了经济使用车辆，又尽快地把煤运给了用户。最近，一部分列车更发展到定线、定时间开行，把每天几点开车、去向车站都固定下来，使各方面能更主动地互相配合。为了增开这种列车，联合办公室每月根据原煤运输任务，做出车流方向的统计，按照各地对不同煤种的需要，在编制作业计划时就采取平衡煤种，集中去向等措施。大同矿务局运销处也曾派人到用煤企业联系，对用煤企业的装卸能力、用煤时间等作了调查，据以组织直达列车。
    为了尽快地把煤运到各重点用煤企业，大同矿务局各矿职工大搞装卸技术革命，提高装车效率，减少火车在车站的停留时间。除了三个矿有现代化煤仓装车处外，其他矿普遍采用土法上马的办法，改进装车机具，提高了装车效率。大斗沟、胡家湾、黄石岩等三个矿还建起了土煤仓。过去装一列车煤要三个多小时，现在只用三十分钟。各煤矿还节省出五百多名装煤工人支援了生产第一线。
