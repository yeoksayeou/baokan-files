Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang. The people of Liaoning Province, which suffered from the once-in-a-century extraordinary floods, have minimized the disaster brought by the floods with the heroic spirit of "If the flood rises by one foot, the enthusiasm rises by ten feet" and have rapidly restored production. Now the people of the whole province, with a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm, have plunged into the production increase and economization campaign centered on grain and steel, determined to make up for the disaster losses.

In late July and early August, the eastern region of Liaoning Province, centered on Fushun, Benxi, Liaoyang, and Andong, was affected by Pacific Typhoon No. 5. Torrential rains of 300 to 400 millimeters fell continuously within two or three days, and the water levels of the Taizi River, Hun River, and other tributaries of the Liao River and the Yalu River basin rose sharply, successively experiencing extraordinary flood peaks. According to historical data and records, the rainfall during this flood period was much greater than the rainfall during the two largest floods encountered in nearly a century, namely the floods of 1888 and 1929, thus causing disasters that were irresistible to human power. In the province, parts of farmland in seven cities and twenty-two counties were flooded, and some factories and mines were forced to stop production or operate at half capacity; individual sections of railways such as Shenyang-Dalian, Shenyang-Jilin, Shenyang-Andong, and Liaoyang-Benxi were also temporarily cut off.

Before the flood season arrived, Party organizations in various parts of Liaoning had made early ideological and material preparations for flood prevention. Before and after the arrival of the floods, leading cadres at all levels in the province went to the front line. Wherever there was a dangerous situation, they would appear there. After the disaster occurred, the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee immediately issued an emergency instruction, calling on the entire Party and the entire people to devote themselves wholeheartedly to the flood fighting struggle. The Party and the state were very concerned about the disaster situation in Liaoning, and the Central Government promptly sent a working group to guide and inspect. Responsible comrades from the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, as well as condolence groups and working groups headed by provincial Party secretaries and vice governors, went deep into the major industrial and mining enterprises and rural areas affected by the disaster to lead the masses in carrying out flood fighting and production recovery. The care and strong leadership of the Party greatly encouraged the morale of the masses, enabling them to overcome this flood attack, which was fierce and widespread.

The workers and staff of Fushun West Open-pit Mine persisted in production in the rainstorm, making their coal output exceed the level before the disaster in one go. The workers and staff of Anshan Iron and Steel's ironmaking plant and various steelmaking plants repaired equipment and rushed to transport raw materials day and night in shifts, so that the four blast furnaces and nine open-hearth furnaces that had once been forced to shut down quickly resumed production completely. In the struggle against the disaster, the broad masses showed the communist qualities of selflessness and mutual support, and a large number of advanced figures and advanced collectives emerged. The No. 2 Power Generation Workshop of the Power Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company once experienced a power outage in the entire workshop due to the water ingress and burnout of the pump cable being installed. There was no water replenishment in the boiler, and the steam pressure dropped from 29 kilograms to 8 kilograms, and then the generator stopped rotating. At this critical moment, under the leadership of the Party branch secretary and the workshop director, all the workers in the workshop quickly eliminated the fault, risking the danger of the boiler exploding at any time, and turned the power plant from danger to safety. In the case of water source cutoff, the workers of this plant, relying on the support of the people of the city, overcame the water shortage difficulties by carrying water with human shoulders, pumping water with water pumps, and other methods, persisting in power generation, and powerfully supporting the struggle of Benxi and Caitun two coal mines to prevent flood and restore production. In the struggle to protect the well from floods, 18 advanced collectives and 239 heroic models emerged from the Caitun Coal Mine. The broad masses of cadres and members of rural people's communes also demonstrated the noble qualities of heroism, tenacity, and care for public property in this struggle. Many cadres and Party members gave priority to rescuing public property and the property of the masses in the disaster relief, which was well received by the members. Communist Party members and cadres of the Xiaoxuan Production Brigade of Anping Commune in the suburbs of Liaoyang City contracted ten commune members each in the flood fighting and disaster relief, and were responsible for them to the end. Driven by the selfless spirit and actions of the Party members and cadres, all the people, livestock, grain, clothing, etc. of the entire team were evacuated within two hours. The troops stationed in Liaoning Province, the staff of cultural and educational, financial and trade departments, and people from all walks of life in non-disaster areas all actively supported the industrial and agricultural flood fighting and disaster relief and production recovery. The people of various cities helped the disaster-stricken rural areas harvest crops, restore production, and properly arrange their lives with manpower and materials.

The Party Central Committee and the State Council have given great concern and support to the recovery of production in the disaster areas of Liaoning, and brother provinces and cities across the country have also transferred a large number of materials and manpower to support Liaoning, thus accelerating the progress of production recovery. The State Council recently decided to allocate disaster relief funds and a large number of relief supplies to help the people in the disaster areas restore production.

After overcoming the extraordinary floods, in recent days the people in urban and rural areas of Liaoning Province have once again, under the leadership of the Party, plunged into the production increase and economization campaign centered on grain and steel. Many factories and mine workers quickly discussed and formulated production increase and economization plans for the next few months, and immediately launched a vigorous production increase and economization competition, determined to make up for the losses caused by the disaster. The workers and staff of Anshan Iron and Steel took the lead. After fully restoring production, they launched a key-tackling performance competition around the key to production, making steel production flourish. In the first four days of the key-tackling performance competition, the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant broke through 139 key items and created 121 new records. After the workers and staff of the No. 4 Blast Furnace of the Ironmaking Plant overcame many production keys, they produced 1,700 tons of pig iron more than planned in the second half of August. The workers and staff of the two major coal mines, Benxi and Fushun, have also launched a production increase and economization competition, striving to supply steel enterprises with more and better coking coal. In the production increase and economization competition, the workers and staff of Fushun Coal Mine carried out a major overall technical transformation of the coal mine, which greatly increased coal production. Compared with the middle and upper ten days, the average daily output of coal increased by 24.8%, and the average footage of tunneling increased by 19.1%. In the last ten days of August, coal production and tunneling footage have new growth.

The widespread production increase and economization campaign in rural areas is also in full swing. In the disaster-stricken areas, under the slogan of "rush to harvest one crop, plant one crop" and "where it is lost, find it there," efforts are being made to drain water and support seedlings, rescue crops, and rush to plant late autumn crops. At present, the province has drained accumulated water from 50% of the land area that was flooded, and has rushed to plant autumn vegetables and buckwheat. Together with the pre-disaster planting area, the province has overfulfilled the autumn vegetable planting plan by 47%. While grasping production, great efforts are also being made to arrange the lives of the disaster-stricken people. Five cities, including Anshan, Lushun-Dalian, Fushun, Andong, and Yingkou, have helped the disaster victims build and repair a number of houses. The disaster-stricken people of the province are stepping up production with high enthusiasm and full confidence, striving to turn severe disasters into light disasters and reduce production without reducing income.

People in non-disaster areas are grasping the late-stage management of field crops, striving to harvest more grain to support disaster areas.

    发扬大无畏的革命英雄主义　发扬人民群众的主观能动作用
    辽宁战胜特大洪水迅速恢复生产
    工矿企业和广大农村热烈开展增产节约运动弥补受灾损失
    据新华社沈阳讯　遭受百年未遇的特大洪水侵袭的辽宁省人民，以“洪水高一尺、干劲高一丈”的英雄气概，把这次洪水带来的灾害缩小到最低限度，并迅速恢复了生产。现在全省人民又以高度的革命干劲，投入了以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动，决心弥补受灾损失。
    7月底、8月初，以抚顺、本溪、辽阳、安东为中心的辽宁东部地区受太平洋第五号台风影响，先后在两、三天内连降暴雨三百到四百毫米，太子河、浑河等辽河支流和鸭绿江流域水位猛涨，相继出现特大洪峰。据历史资料和记载，这次洪水期间的降雨量比近百年来遇到的两次最大洪水，即1888年和1929年洪水期间的降雨量都要大得多，因而，造成了人力不可抗拒的灾害。全省七个市、二十二个县的部分农田被淹，有一些工厂和矿山被迫停止生产或半停产；沈（阳）大
  （连）、沈（阳）吉（林）、沈（阳）安（东）、辽（阳）本（溪）等铁路线的个别路段也都一度断绝通车。
    汛期来到以前，辽宁各地党组织就及早进行了防汛的思想和物资准备工作。在洪水到达前后，全省各级领导干部亲赴第一线，哪里有险情，他们就出现在哪里。灾情发生以后，中共辽宁省委又立即发出紧急指示，号召全党全民，全力以赴地投入抗洪斗争。党和国家十分关心辽宁的灾情，中央曾及时派出工作组前来指导和视察。水利电力部、铁道部、冶金部、煤炭部、交通部、内务部的负责同志和以省委书记、副省长为首的慰问团、工作组，深入受灾的主要工矿企业和农村，领导群众开展抗洪斗争和恢复生产。党的关怀和坚强领导，大大鼓舞了群众的斗志，使他们战胜了这次来势猛、范围大的洪水袭击。
    抚顺西露天矿全体职工在暴雨中坚持生产，一鼓作气，使煤炭产量超过受灾前的水平。鞍钢炼铁厂和各炼钢厂职工，日夜不断地轮流检修设备和抢运原料，使曾经一度被迫停产的四座高炉和九座平炉迅速全部恢复了生产。在抗灾斗争中，广大群众表现出了舍己为公、互相支援的共产主义品质，先进人物和先进集体大量涌现出来。本溪钢铁公司发电厂第二发电车间曾由于正在安装的水泵电缆进水被烧坏，一度引起全车间厂用电停电，锅炉里没水补充，汽压由二十九公斤降低到八公斤，接着发电机停转了。在这千钧一发之际，全车间职工在党支部书记、车间主任带动下，冒着锅炉随时可能爆炸的危险，迅速排除故障，使电厂转危为安。在水源断绝的情况下，这个厂的职工依靠全市人民的支援，用人担水、水泵打水等办法，战胜缺水困难，坚持发电，有力地支援了本溪和彩屯两煤矿防洪抢险、恢复生产的斗争。彩屯煤矿职工在防洪护井斗争中，就涌现出十八个先进集体和二百三十九名英雄模范。农村人民公社广大干部和社员也在这次斗争中，表现了英勇顽强和爱护公共财产的高贵品质。许多干部和党员在抗灾中，首先抢救公共财产和群众的财产，受到社员们的好评。辽阳市郊安平公社小漩生产大队的共产党员、干部在抗洪抢险中每人包干十户社员，负责到底，在党员、干部的忘我的精神和行动带动下，不到两小时，全队人、畜、粮食、衣物等全部脱险。辽宁省各地驻军，文教、财贸等部门工作人员，以及非灾区各界人民，都积极支援工农业抗洪抢险和恢复生产的斗争。各城市人民以人力和物力帮助受灾农村抢收庄稼，恢复生产和妥善安排生活。
    党中央和国务院对辽宁灾区恢复生产给予极大的关怀和支持，全国兄弟省、市也抽调大批物资和人力支援辽宁，因而加快了生产恢复进度。国务院最近决定调拨救灾款和大批救济物资，帮助灾区人民恢复生产。
    在战胜特大洪水以后，连日来辽宁省城乡人民又在党领导下，投入了以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动。许多工厂、矿山职工迅速地讨论和制定了今后几个月的增产节约计划，并立即掀起热火朝天的增产节约竞赛，决心弥补受灾的损失。鞍钢各厂矿职工一马当先，在全部恢复生产以后，围绕生产关键，开展了攻关表演赛，使钢铁生产蒸蒸日上。第一炼钢厂在攻关表演赛头四天就攻破关键一百三十九项，创造新纪录一百二十一次。炼铁厂四号高炉职工攻克许多生产关键以后，8月下半月比计划超产生铁一千七百吨。本溪、抚顺两大煤矿的职工，也都开展了增产节约竞赛，力争供应钢铁企业更多更好的焦煤。抚顺煤矿职工在增产节约竞赛中，大搞煤矿总体技术改造，使煤炭产量大幅度地提高，中旬和上旬比较，煤产平均日产量提高24.8％，掘进平均进尺提高19.1％，8月下旬，煤炭产量和掘进进尺又有新的增长。
    广大农村增产节约运动也正在轰轰烈烈地展开着。受灾区在“冲一茬、种一茬”，“哪里丢、哪里找”的口号下，大力排水扶苗、抢救庄稼和抢种晚秋作物。目前全省已经把占整个受涝土地面积50％的土地的积水排除，抢种了秋菜和荞麦，加上灾前播种面积已超额47％完成了全省秋菜播种计划。在大抓生产的同时，还大抓受灾人民的生活安排。鞍山、旅大、抚顺、安东、营口等五个市，已帮助灾民新建和修好一批房屋。全省受灾人民正在干劲冲天、信心百倍地加紧生产，力争重灾变轻灾，减产不减收。
    非灾区人民正在大抓田间作物后期管理。力争多收一些粮食，支援灾区。
