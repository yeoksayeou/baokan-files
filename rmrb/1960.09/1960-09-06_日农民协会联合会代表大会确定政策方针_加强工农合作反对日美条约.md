Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 3rd: The Third National Congress of the National Federation of Agricultural Associations of Japan issued a declaration stating that Japanese farmers are determined to strengthen the struggle to abolish the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and oppose the exploitation of farmers by monopoly capitalists. The congress concluded on the 2nd after holding four days of meetings.

The declaration called on all Japanese farmers to participate in the struggle against the government's announced trade liberalization and "basic agricultural policy," and to strengthen cooperation with the working class in the common struggle to win Japan's peace, democracy, and neutrality.

The policy guidelines adopted by the congress clearly stipulate that the spearhead of the Japanese farmers' struggle should be directed directly at their enemies – U.S. imperialism and Japanese reactionaries, demanding the removal of U.S. military bases from Japan, and strengthening these organizations by having more farmers participate in the existing joint struggle conferences against the "Security Treaty."

The policy guidelines also stipulate that farmers under the protection of the federation will strengthen the propaganda campaign to raise the government's purchase price of rice to match production costs, while lowering the price of fertilizers, agricultural machinery, and other agricultural production equipment, allocating funds from government funds to fully compensate for losses caused by typhoons and floods, striving to improve local administration to eliminate discrimination against certain classes of farmers, and opposing the government's plan to compensate former landlords.

The congress also passed a resolution stating that the federation should support the Socialist Party and the Communist Party in the upcoming general election. Many speakers at the congress emphasized the need to rapidly expand the organization of the National Federation of Agricultural Associations.

    日农民协会联合会代表大会确定政策方针
    加强工农合作反对日美条约
    新华社3日讯东京消息：全日本农民协会联合会第三届全国代表大会发表宣言说，日本农民决心加强争取废除新日美“安全条约”和反对垄断资本家剥削农民的斗争。代表大会在举行了四天会议后已于2日闭幕。
    宣言呼吁全体日本农民参加反对政府宣布的贸易自由化和“基本农业政策”的斗争，在争取日本的和平、民主和中立的共同斗争中加强同工人阶级的合作。
    大会通过的政策方针明确规定日本农民斗争的矛头应当直接指向他们的敌人——美帝国主义和日本反动派，要求从日本撤除美军基地，并且通过更多的农民参加现有的反对“安全条约”共同斗争会议来加强这些组织。
    政策方针还规定，在联合会保护下的农民，将加强宣传运动，争取提高政府对大米的收购价格以符合生产费用，同时降低肥料、农业机器和其他农业生产设备的价格，从政府资金中拨款充分赔偿台风和水灾所造成的损失，争取改善地方的行政管理以消除对某些阶层的农民的歧视并且反对政府赔偿前地主的计划。
    大会还通过决议说，联合会应当在即将举行的大选中支持社会党和共产党。许多在大会上发言的人着重指出需要迅速扩大农民协会联合会的组织。
