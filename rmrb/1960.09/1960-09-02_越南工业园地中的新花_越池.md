    The New Flower in Vietnam's Industrial Park - Việt Trì
    Yang Dan, Xing Yan, Zhou Sheng
    Driving northwest from Hanoi, crossing eighty kilometers of highway on the red soil plains, when crossing the Lô River Bridge, an enchanting scene immediately appears before your eyes: at the confluence of the Thao, Lô, and Đáy Rivers, on the highlands dotted with green betel palms and fan palms, there is a construction site stretching for several kilometers. Newly built factories, with their different styles and colors, form a harmonious and beautiful architectural complex. This is the industrial city of Việt Trì, which is under construction.
    The temperature in Vietnam in summer is very high, but the enthusiasm of the builders of Việt Trì is even higher. When we entered this construction site, we were immediately attracted by the vigorous labor scene. Workers carrying sand and gravel passed by us in long lines. On the path next to the concrete mixer, young men and women walked quickly, transporting concrete. On the road, trucks carrying materials sped by. Bulldozers moved back and forth, leveling the ground for future wharf warehouses. On the densely packed scaffolding of the paper mill construction site, young workers sang songs while working. Comrades on the construction site told us: "This group of young workers are the future technicians of the paper mill. They just finished their internship a month ago. In order to build the factory as soon as possible, they applied to the Party committee, requesting to participate in the construction immediately."
    Fourteen years ago, Việt Trì was a vast swamp. After the Vietnamese people drove away the Japanese fascist invaders, they gradually built a small town here. During the anti-French war, because Việt Trì faced three major rivers and was a transportation hub connecting the northern plains and mountainous areas of Vietnam, French imperialism occupied it as a military stronghold. Việt Trì was completely destroyed and became a ruin. After the restoration of peace, in 1958, the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party decided to call on the construction of Việt Trì into a modern industrial city. More than 5,000 builders enthusiastically responded to the Party's call and, in just over two years, built it into an industrial city with a preliminary scale.
    The construction of the Việt Trì industrial zone fully embodies the construction spirit of "fast, practical, and vigorous." Comrade Nguyen Suu of the Việt Trì Municipal Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party told us: "The industrial zone started construction on November 11, 1958. In just over a year, many factories have been basically completed. The sugar factory and rice mill were built in less than a year; the Việt Trì power plant with a power generation capacity of 16,000 kilowatts will also be completed in just over a year."
    Such a huge and complex project as the construction of the Việt Trì industrial zone, how many skilled workers and technicians would it require! However, when construction began, most of the workers were demobilized soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army. The entire construction site had neither engineers nor technical cadres, only one teacher who had taught at the Hanoi Construction School served as the technical director of the construction site. The builders of Việt Trì were not intimidated by the difficulties. They carried forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Vietnamese people and threw themselves into this new battle with confidence. Through hard work and persistent study, new technical forces have grown up. Now, more than a thousand skilled workers have been trained. Chen Wenxuan, the captain of the carpentry team, was a child who herded cattle for landlords before the August Revolution and was illiterate. After practical training, he can now master many types of work techniques and has been elected as a labor model five times in a row. Fitter Chen Dezu is even younger. When the August Revolution was victorious, he often went to Hoan Kiem Lake in Hanoi to play "anti-aggression" games. Today, he can skillfully operate various ironworking tasks. When we visited the sugar factory, a comrade who used to be a soldier of the Vietnamese People's Army explained it to us. Next to the brand-new machines and various pipes emitting the smell of paint, he started from the automatic cutting and automatic squeezing of sugarcane, all the way to evaporation, sedimentation, filtration, coagulation, crystallization... and explained the performance of various machines; he knew the entire production process like the back of his hand, we were clearly listening to a sugar industry expert lecturing. Vietnamese comrades, both technically and administratively, have been able to skillfully lead and manage the construction of this industrial zone.
    In order to welcome the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Republic, the labor competition on the construction site is in full swing. Everyone is determined to create the best results and dedicate them to the beloved motherland. Their bold slogan is: "Unless the water of the Lô River stops flowing, our labor efficiency will not improve!" New records on the construction site are like a hundred flowers blooming, one after another. The comrades who carry soil have increased from carrying two baskets each time to four baskets, from carrying fifty kilograms each time to one hundred and twenty kilograms. The screening machine they created increased work efficiency by two times. They also used various substitutes, saving a lot of materials... The workers responsible for the construction of the power plant, in order to complete the construction of the pump room before the Lô River rises, vowed "We must run ahead of the flood!" One day, groundwater emerged there, and the workers held hands, forming a "human wall", using their bodies to block the water. They worked in deep mud, three shifts in rotation, day and night. After such tense fighting for two months, they finally completed the task victoriously. Whether in the cold winter or the scorching summer, the builders on the entire construction site worked with great energy as usual. Just like they sang:
    We are not afraid of getting our faces tanned,
    Carry a few more loads of mud!
    Quickly flatten this mountain!...
    A Vietnamese comrade on the construction site took us to the bank of the rolling Thao River. He pointed to the sugar factory that had just been completed and said: "This giant will eat 350 tons of sugarcane a day. The sugarcane residue it spits out will be transported from there to the paper mill, which is a good raw material for papermaking." We looked in the direction he pointed, and saw a light railway leading from the sugar factory to the paper mill. The construction of the Việt Trì industrial zone reflects the "comprehensive utilization" policy, and the production of various factories is closely linked. The chemical plant can also supply the raw materials such as soda, sulfuric acid, and hydrochloric acid needed by the paper mill.
    According to the three-year plan of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from 1958 to 1960, Việt Trì will be built into one of the important industrial bases in northern Vietnam. Soon, this plan will be realized. At that time, it will have the largest power plant in northern Vietnam, a paper mill producing 2,000 tons of high-grade paper annually, a sugar factory producing more than 5,000 tons of sugar annually, as well as rice mills, sawmills, monosodium glutamate factories, and a total of more than ten factories. Each factory is like a newly opened flower, and each factory will bear fruitful results in the socialist industrial park.
    On our way to Phuc Tho after leaving Việt Trì, we climbed the Hung King Mountain, named after the first emperor of Vietnam. Standing in front of the Hung King Temple at the top of the mountain, looking east, the new flower of Việt Trì shone in the sun; around it, rivers and streams crisscrossed, and sugarcane fields and rice fields were scattered like stars. We silently thought: In the long years since the Hung King, how much suffering has this rich land endured! But the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, have now built it so beautifully, so unforgettable! (Attached picture)

    越南工业园地中的新花——越池
    杨丹　邢雁　周生
    从河内乘汽车向西北行进，越过红土平原上八十公里的公路，在跨上泸江大桥的时候，眼前立即出现令人神往的景色：在滔江、泸江、底江汇合的地方，在周围点缀着绿叶招展的槟榔和葵树的高地上，有一片伸延几公里长的工地，一座座新建的工厂，以各自不同的样式和色彩，构成和谐、美观的建筑群。这就是正在兴建中的工业城市越池。
    越南夏天的温度是很高的，可是越池的建设者们的劳动热情更高。当我们走进这片工地的时候，蓬蓬勃勃的劳动景象立刻吸引住我们。工人们挑着砂石，一队连着一队，从我们身旁穿过。在混凝土搅拌机旁边的小路上，小伙子和姑娘们迈着飞快的步子，运送混凝土。公路上，奔驰着运送材料的汽车。推土机进进退退，正为未来的码头仓库铲平地面。在造纸厂工地密密麻麻的脚手架上，青年工人一边劳动，一边唱着歌子。工地上的同志告诉我们：“这批年轻的劳动者是未来的造纸厂的技术人员，他们一个月以前刚结束了实习。为了早日把工厂建成，他们向党委提出申请，要求立即参加建设。”
    十四年以前，越池是一片茫茫的沼泽地。越南人民赶走了日本法西斯侵略者以后，逐渐在这里建设起一座小镇。在抗法战争的年代，由于越池面濒三大河流，又是越北平原地区和山区的交通要道，法帝国主义占据了它，作为军事据点，越池受到了彻底的破坏，成为一片废墟。和平恢复以后，1958年，越南劳动党中央作出决定，号召把越池建设成一座现代化的工业城市。五千多名建设者热烈地响应党的号召，在短短两年多时间，就把这里建成一座初具规模的工业城市了。
    越池工业区的建设，充分体现了“快速、落实、猛进”的建设精神。越南劳动党越池市委阮丑同志给我们说：“工业区是1958年11月11日开始动工的，一年多时间，许多工厂已经基本建成。糖厂和碾米厂，不到一年就建成了；发电能力为一万六千瓩的越池发电厂，也只需用一年多，就可以全部完工”。
    建设越池工业区这样巨大、复杂的工程，该需要多少熟练的工人和技术人员啊！可是，在动工兴建的时候，大部分工人是转业的越南人民军战士，整个工地既没有工程师，也没有技术干部，只有一位曾经在河内建筑学校教过书的教师，担任工地的技术总指导。越池的建设者并没有被困难吓倒，他们发扬越南人民光荣的革命传统，满怀信心地投入了这场新的战斗。经过艰苦的努力和顽强的学习，新的技术力量已经成长起来了。现在，培养出的技术工人已经有一千多名。木工队队长陈文玄，在八月革命以前是个给地主放牛的孩子，一字不识，经过实际的锻炼，现在已经能够掌握很多工种的技术，曾经连续五次当选为劳动模范。钳工陈德祖年纪更轻，八月革命胜利的时候，还常常到河内的还剑湖畔作“反侵略”游戏，今天已经能够熟练地操作各种铁工活了。在我们参观糖厂的时候，一位曾经是越南人民军战士的同志给我们讲解。在崭新的机器和散发着油漆香味的各种管道旁边，他从甘蔗的自动切削、自动压榨说起，一直说到蒸发、沉淀、过滤、凝固、结晶……并且说明了各种机器的性能；整个生产过程他都了如指掌，我们分明是在听一位制糖工业专家在讲课。越南同志无论从技术或行政上，都已经能够熟练地领导和管理这个工业区的建设了。
    为了迎接共和国成立十五周年，工地上的劳动竞赛开展得热火朝天。人人都决心创造最好的成绩，献给可爱的祖国。他们提出的豪迈口号是：“除非泸江的水不再流，我们的劳动效率才不提高！”工地上的新纪录像百花争艳一样，一个跟着一个。挑土的同志从每人每次挑两筐提高到四筐，从每次挑五十公斤，提高到一百二十公斤。他们创造的筛沙机使工效提高了两倍。他们还采用各种代用品，节约了大量材料，……负责建设发电厂的工人，为了赶在泸江涨水以前完成水泵房的工程，他们发誓“一定要跑在洪水前面！”有一天，那里冒出了地下水，工人们手挽着手，结成一堵“人墙”，硬是用身体把水堵住。他们在深深的泥浆中，三班轮流工作，日夜不停。这样紧张地战斗了两个月，终于胜利完成了任务。无论在寒风冷雨的冬天，或是烈日曝晒的夏季，整个工地上的建设者都是精神抖擞地照常工作。正像他们唱的：
    我们不怕晒黑了脸，
    多把泥土挑几担哟！
    赶快削平这座山！……
    工地上的一位越南同志带我们来到滚滚奔流的滔江的岸上，他指着刚刚完工的糖厂说：“这个巨人一天要吃下三百五十吨甘蔗。它吐出的甘蔗渣，将要从那里一直运到造纸厂，那是很好的造纸原料。”我们顺着他指的方向看去，只见一条轻便小铁道，从制糖厂一直通向造纸厂。越池工业区的建设体现了
  “综合利用”的方针，各个工厂的生产有着密切的联系。造纸厂需要的苏打、硫酸、盐酸等原料，化工厂也可以供给。
    按照越南民主共和国1958—1960年的三年计划，越池将建成为越南北方的重要工业基地之一。不久，这个计划就要实现了。那时候，这里将拥有越南北方目前最大的发电厂，年产两千吨高级纸张的造纸厂，年产五千多吨糖的制糖厂，还有碾米厂、锯木厂、味精厂等一共十多个工厂。每座工厂都像新开的花朵，每座工厂都将在社会主义的工业园地中结下累累的果实。
    在我们告别了越池前往福寿的路上，我们攀登上以越南第一个皇帝的名字命名的雄王山。站在山顶的雄王庙前面，向东远望，越池这簇新花在阳光下闪灼着光彩；在它的周围，江河交错纵横，蔗园和稻田星罗棋布。我们默默地想着：从雄王以来的漫长岁月中，这片富绕的土地经受了多少苦难啊！可是越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席领导下，现在把这里又建设得多么美好，多么让人留恋忘返啊！（附图片）
