　　Seeing "Big Things" from "Small Things"

　　What appears to be a "small thing" often becomes the precursor to a "big thing"; what seems to be an ordinary task often becomes the guide to a major innovation. Removing yellow vines (a type of weed) is one aspect of autumn management. Because yellow vines grow every year and are removed every year, people have become accustomed to it. However, cadres and members of the Lighthouse Commune in Zhongwei County put their minds to work on this problem: Can we fundamentally eliminate yellow vines and remove this trouble from agricultural production altogether? If we can do this, on the one hand, we can completely eliminate the harm of yellow vines to crops, and on the other hand, can't we also save a lot of labor spent on removing yellow vines every year? This problem is well thought out, and thoughtfully researched. Cadres participating in production and leading production should put their minds to work on these aspects. We should greatly promote this trend.

　　Associating from the "small thing" of removing yellow vines, are there other farm tasks in agricultural production besides yellow vines that should be fundamentally eliminated to save a batch of labor? Probably not. For example, can we fundamentally find ways to eliminate barnyard grass in rice paddies and wild oats in wheat fields? The labor we spend on pulling barnyard grass and wild oats every year is no less than that spent on removing yellow vines. At the same time, barnyard grass and wild oats seriously affect the yield and quality of rice and wheat. Is this kind of thinking just wishful thinking? No. The Lighthouse Commune's measures to eliminate yellow vines answer this question. As long as comprehensive measures are taken in terms of seed selection, crop rotation, plowing, pest control, etc., it is entirely possible.

　　From here, we can think even deeper. Are there any farm tasks now that can be "two-in-one"? For example, what used to be two or several procedures can now be turned into one procedure, which does not affect the quality of the farm work and has no impact on increasing production. This is indeed worthy of our great consideration and research. According to past habits, weeding, cultivating, and topdressing were generally carried out separately; now it is different. The original three procedures are merged into one, so you can weed, cultivate, and topdress at the same time, accomplishing the work that used to take "three times" to do. There are many such examples. This shows that production methods are advancing towards scientific and rational paths in the practice of the masses. These reforms may not seem like much at first, but when you calculate the detailed accounts of production and labor, you will feel that it is a remarkable thing.

　　Last year, the Guyuan Special District calculated this account: If the entire special district universally promotes livestock pens on the mountains and pure manure on the mountains, it can save 4.37 million labor days per year just on the transportation of manure to the mountains. These labor days can be used to build seven reservoirs. Slightly reforming the irrigation methods can not only make full use of the land's fertility, eliminate field headlands, and ensure full seedlings, but also save a large amount of labor for digging field headlands; slightly reforming the ramie retting method not only saves labor, but also uses the ramie retting pits to compost manure and use ramie retting water to fertilize the fields. From here, we can see that there is great potential for innovating the production process; some outdated production methods in agricultural production can also be greatly changed.

　　In agricultural production, some unreasonable production processes and production methods are mostly inherited from the small-scale peasant economy. The decentralized management of individual households as a production unit determines the specific methods of production. Although there are many of these unreasonable phenomena, due to the limitations of the small-scale peasant economy, this contradiction is difficult to resolve. With the change of ownership of the means of production and the development of productive forces, the contradiction between these old production methods and unreasonable production processes inherited from the past and large-scale collective production is becoming increasingly prominent and increasingly incompatible. Through the agricultural cooperation movement, especially after the people's commune, with the development of agricultural technical innovation and the technical revolution movement, we have already had many reforms. Every reform has not only powerfully promoted the development of production, but also greatly saved labor. However, we should also see that what is considered reasonable and unreasonable can only be relative, not absolute. With the development of productive forces, the production process must be continuously innovated, and production methods must be continuously improved. We must establish the thought of continuous revolution, conduct thorough investigation and research regularly, and continuously promote the rationalization of agricultural production processes and production methods according to the needs of continuous development of production.

### 从“小事”看“大事”

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    从“小事”看“大事”
    看来是一件“小事”，往往会成为“大事”的前因；看来是一项平凡的工作，也常常会成为一项重大革新的前导。摘黄藤子（一种杂草），是秋田管理中的一个内容。由于黄藤年年生、年年摘，人们已经习以为常了。但是，中卫县灯塔公社的干部和社员们却在这个问题上动了脑筋：能不能从根本上消灭黄藤子，从农业生产中一笔勾掉这项麻烦呢？如果能够这样办，一方面可以彻底消灭黄藤子对作物的危害，另一方面不是还可以节省每年花费在摘黄藤子上面的大量劳动吗？这个问题想得好，想得有学问。干部参加生产、领导生产，就应该多从这些方面动脑筋。我们应该大兴此风。
    从摘黄藤子这件“小事”联想起，在农业生产上的各项农活中，是不是光有黄藤子应该从根本上消灭掉，可以节省一批劳动力呢？恐非如此。比如说，水稻田里的稗子，小麦田里的野燕麦，能不能也从根本上想办法，把它消灭掉呢？每年我们用在拔稗子、拔燕麦上的劳动力，计算一下也不比摘黄藤子少多少，同时稗子、燕麦也严重影响着水稻和小麦的产量和质量。这种设想，是不是空想呢？不是。灯塔公社消灭黄藤子的措施回答了这个问题，只要从选种、倒槎、翻地、灭子等等方面，采取综合措施，是完全可能的。
    从这里，我们还可以再向深处联想一下，现在的各项农活中，有没有可以“二合一”的呢？比如说原来是两道工序或几道工序，现在把它变成一道工序，既不影响农活质量，对增产又毫无影响。这的确是值得我们大加思索、大加研究的。按照过去的习惯，除草、中耕、追肥，一般都是分别进行的；现在不同了，原来三道工序合并成一道，随薅草、随中耕、随追肥，一下子就干了过去“三下子”的活。这些例子是很不少的。这说明，生产方法在群众实践中，正在向着科学化、合理化道路前进。这些改革，起初看来似乎也算不了什么，可是从生产上、劳力上一算细账，就会感到是件很了不起的事。
                     ×  ×
    去年，固原专区曾经算过这笔账：如果全专区普遍推广畜圈上山、纯粪上山，光在每年往山地里运粪这一项上就可以节约四百三十七万个劳动工日，用这些劳动工日可以修筑七座水库。从淌水方法上稍微加以改革，不仅可以充分利用地力，消灭田嘴子，保证全苗，而且可以节约一大批挖田嘴子的劳动力；在沤麻方法上稍微加以改革，不仅节省了劳力，而且利用沤麻坑沤了粪，利用沤麻水肥了田。从这里我们可以看到，革新生产过程是大有可为的；农业生产中的一些过了时的生产方法也是大有改头的。
    在农业生产中，一些不合理的生产过程和生产方法，大都是从小农经济时期因袭下来的。一家一户为一个生产单位的分散经营，决定着生产的具体方法。尽管这些不合理的现象很多，但是，由于小农经济的限制，这个矛盾是很难解决的。随着生产资料所有制的改变和生产力的发展，过去因袭下来的这些旧的生产方法和不合理的生产过程和大集体生产之间的矛盾就越来越突出了，就越来越不能相适应了。通过农业合作化运动，特别是人民公社化以后，随着农业技术革新和技术革命运动的发展，我们已经有了很多改革。每一项改革，都不仅有力地促进了生产的发展，而且还大大节约了劳动力。但是，我们还应该看到，所谓合理与不合理，都只能是相对的，而不是绝对的。随着生产力的发展，生产过程就必须不断革新，生产方法也必须不断改进。我们要树立不断革命的思想，经常地进行周密的调查研究，按照生产不断发展的需要，来不断地促进农业生产过程和生产方法的合理化。
