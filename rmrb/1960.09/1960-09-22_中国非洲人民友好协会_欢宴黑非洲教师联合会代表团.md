Xinhua News Agency, September 21st—The China-Africa People's Friendship Association hosted a banquet this evening to welcome all members of the delegation of the Black African Teachers' Union, headed by N'Doh Amadou. The banquet was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere.

    Qu Wu, Vice President of the China-Africa People's Friendship Association, expressed his cordial respect to the African friends at the banquet. He said that through mutual visits, the African people and the Chinese people will be able to further enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese and African people.

    Qu Wu, who had just returned from a visit to Africa not long ago, said that the struggle of the people of African countries against imperialism and colonialism for the sake of maintaining and striving for independence has greatly encouraged the Chinese people. The Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the people of African countries, and believe that the struggle of the people of African countries against imperialism and colonialism will surely achieve a complete victory. Finally, he proposed a toast to the complete liberation of the African people who are still enslaved and oppressed.

    Head of the delegation, N'Doh Amadou, spoke at the banquet with warm and friendly feelings. He said that the African people, like the Chinese people, have been oppressed and exploited by imperialism, have suffered from racial discrimination, and have been humiliated by imperialism. He said that all this has promoted the African revolution. The common anti-imperialist struggle has linked us together. This is a friendship formed under a common destiny, and it is the most solid friendship.

    N'Doh Amadou said that there is an African proverb, "The enemy of our enemy is our friend." He said that the Chinese people regard imperialism as an enemy, and we also regard imperialism as our enemy. Therefore, the Chinese people are our friends. Imperialism attempts to deny the existence of China and attempts to undermine our friendship, but this will not succeed.

    This African friend finally said that the African people believe that their struggle is part of the world's struggle. China's victory has strengthened our struggle and weakened imperialism. He raised his glass and proposed a toast: to the friendship between the Chinese and African people, and to the elimination of imperialism—imperialism is the root cause of war.

    Zhou Erfu, Wu Qing, Chen Gongqi, Fang Ming, Cai Yingping, Liu Ziyu and others attended the banquet this evening.

　　中国非洲人民友好协会
　　欢宴黑非洲教师联合会代表团
    新华社21日讯　中国非洲人民友好协会今晚设宴欢迎以恩多·阿玛杜为首的黑非洲教师联合会代表团全体成员。宴会上充满了热烈友好的气氛。
    中非友协副会长屈武在宴会上向非洲朋友们表示亲切的敬意，他说，非洲人民和中国人民通过相互访问，将能进一步增进中非人民之间的相互了解和友谊。
    屈武在不久以前才从非洲访问回国，他说，非洲各国人民为维护和争取独立而对帝国主义和殖民主义展开的斗争，大大地鼓舞了中国人民。中国人民坚决支持非洲各国人民的正义斗争，并且相信非洲各国人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争，一定会取得彻底的胜利。最后他建议为还在受奴役受压迫的非洲人民的彻底解放而干杯。
    恩多·阿玛杜团长在宴会上怀着热烈的友好感情讲话，他说，非洲人民同中国人民一样受过帝国主义的压迫和剥削，一样地遭受过种族歧视，一样地受过帝国主义的侮辱。他说，这一切都推动了非洲的革命。共同的反帝斗争把我们连结在一起，这是在共同的命运下结成的友谊，这是最巩固的友谊。
    恩多·阿玛杜说，非洲人有一句俗语，“我们敌人的敌人，就是我们的朋友”。他说，中国人民把帝国主义当成敌人，我们也同样把帝国主义当成我们的敌人，因此，中国人民是我们的朋友。帝国主义企图否认中国的存在，企图破坏我们的友谊，这是达不到目的的。
    这位非洲朋友最后说，非洲人民相信自己的斗争是全世界斗争的一部分。中国的胜利加强了我们的斗争，削弱了帝国主义。他举杯建议：为了中非人民的友谊，为了消灭帝国主义——帝国主义是战争的根源——而干杯。
    出席今晚宴会的有周而复、吴青、陈公琪、方明、蔡英平、刘子余等人。
