　　The Heinous American Imperialism
　　Zhang Zhenya

　　In the fifteen years since the war, the United States has become increasingly reactionary in its domestic and foreign policies. Its endless outward expansion and its frantic arms race have become the most prominent phenomena in international affairs, and they are increasingly threatening world peace and human security. This situation is inseparable from the increasingly reactionary and decadent nature of the two major American bourgeois parties and successive governments after the war, and the increasing interference of American military personnel in government policies. But more importantly and fundamentally, the economic monopoly, parasitism, and moribund nature of American financial oligarchs have reached their peak. The contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces in American society are becoming increasingly unsolvable. Therefore, they are trying their best to find a way out by intensifying foreign plunder, foreign expansion, and the arms race.

　　Of course, apologists for the capitalist system will, as always, deny and cover up this most fundamental reactionary economic foundation of American imperialism. However, as long as we examine and analyze the situation of American monopoly capital, we can find that the comprehensive reactionary nature of American imperialism's policy is closely inseparable from its entire economic and social structure, and cannot be shifted and determined by any individual will.

　　Further Development of Monopoly and Concentration

　　The United States is the largest imperialist country in the current capitalist world. It has expanded unprecedentedly during and after World War II, and its monopoly of the domestic economy has become more significant. The share of the 200 largest U.S. manufacturing companies in total manufacturing sales has increased from 37.7% in 1935 to 40.5% in 1950 and 45.5% in 1955. Four aluminum companies monopolize the national aluminum industry, three automobile companies control 96% of car production, and the three largest steel companies monopolize 53.6% of steel production... The 200 largest American companies dominate the nation's economic life, and these 200 companies are controlled by the eight major financial groups led by Rockefeller and Morgan consortia. The assets controlled by the Rockefeller and Morgan consortia alone exceeded 127 billion U.S. dollars in 1955, equivalent to twice the annual budget expenditure of the U.S. federal government at that time! All this shows how firmly the American billionaires have controlled the entire national economic life in their financial clutches.

　　Despite the fact that the concentration of wealth and production in the United States has reached such an alarming level, the spokesmen of American monopoly capital have concocted a myth of "people's capitalism" that American "property is spreading." This myth takes American large joint-stock companies as an example, insisting that workers and small producers who hold shares in these large companies are also capitalists. Since the amount of shares issued by American large companies is particularly large, it is concluded that American large companies are "owned by the people," and thus American capitalism has become "people's capitalism."

　　But the absurdity of this myth is very obvious. Because people who hold a small amount of shares cannot become "capitalists" because of this. They are fundamentally incomparable to the large monopoly financial groups that control these companies. For example, although the "American Telephone and Telegraph Company" has 1.4 million shareholders, who other than a small group of capitalists from the Rockefeller and Morgan consortia can appoint the managers and directors of this largest American company and determine its policies? What's more, the shares of large companies are mostly in the hands of a few large families. The shares held by the DuPont family, one of the eight major financial groups, alone are ten times the total shares of all Americans who earn wages for a living.

　　The reason why American monopoly capital can expand so rapidly is related to the huge amount of super-profits they have continuously obtained from domestic and foreign markets in recent decades. In particular, the tens of billions of dollars in arms profits brought to the United States by the two world wars and the large amount of super-profits provided to them by the U.S. government's arms race after the war have greatly increased their capital accumulation, thereby promoting the concentration and monopoly of American production.

　　Capital accumulation is expanding more and more, and the domestic market is becoming increasingly unable to accommodate "surplus" capital. Therefore, American imperialism must expand outward and monopolize foreign markets. This has resulted in its increasingly large scale of capital export and its increasingly fierce competition for commodity markets and raw material producing areas.

　　For example, after World War I, American foreign investment increased from 7 billion U.S. dollars in 1919 to 17 billion U.S. dollars in 1930, with an annual increase of about 900 million U.S. dollars. In the thirteen years after World War II, American foreign investment increased from 16.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1945 to 59.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1958, with an average annual increase of more than 3.2 billion U.S. dollars, which is more than three times the pre-war speed.

　　In terms of the plunder of raw materials, before the war, American monopoly capital had already controlled 24.5% of the known oil reserves, 16.5% of the known iron ore reserves, 44.5% of the known copper ore reserves, and 20.8% of the known bauxite (raw material for aluminum production) reserves in the capitalist world outside the United States. According to statistics around 1952 after the war, the proportion of the above-mentioned raw materials controlled by the United States abroad increased to: about one-half of oil, more than one-fifth of iron ore, more than one-half of copper, and more than one-third of bauxite.

　　American imperialism has also not slackened in the competition for overseas markets and the trade war. It took advantage of the sluggish exports of Western European imperialist countries in the early post-war period to greatly increase its share in the international market. Before the war, in 1938, the proportion of the United States in the total exports of the capitalist world was 11%, which increased to 32% in 1947. In recent years, due to the rapid recovery of the Western European economy and the more prominent law of uneven capitalist development, the economic strength of American imperialism has greatly declined. Its share in the exports of manufactured goods in the capitalist world has decreased from 26% in 1953 to 21.3% in 1959, but despite this, its exports are still equivalent to twice the exports of Britain or West Germany, and it is still the largest exporter in the capitalist world. Moreover, in recent years, due to the increasing scale of American private capital exports, the products manufactured by American private companies overseas have exceeded twice its domestic exports. Therefore, its dependence on overseas markets cannot be measured by its exports. All this makes it the largest plunderer and the most powerful monopolist in the capitalist world, far exceeding the Western European imperialist countries.

　　Strengthen the Exploitation of Domestic Workers

　　While intensifying the plunder of overseas markets, American monopoly capital has also greatly strengthened the oppression and exploitation of its own working people: the "acceleration system" that squeezes workers' blood and sweat is being intensified in major factories, workers' working conditions are deteriorating day by day, they are aging and getting sick prematurely, their wages are growing far behind the growth of company profits, and their lives are becoming less and less secure.

　　Of course, responsible American officials will, as always, deny the cruel exploitation of the American working people. When Eisenhower visited Brazil in February this year, he said: "Marxist propagandists are trying to belittle the American system. They talk about 'exploited masses'. Indeed, those who have read history know that capitalism often had exploitation in its early stages, but it would be absurd to say that the situation in the 18th and early 19th centuries still exists in today's American economic life." When Nixon visited the Soviet Union last July, he also said: "The United States, the largest capitalist country in the world, is closest to the ideal of everyone enjoying prosperity in a classless society from the perspective of wealth distribution."

　　Propaganda that the United States is already close to a "classless society" and that "everyone enjoys prosperity," that American workers are "middle class," and that a "revolution" favorable to the lower classes has taken place in the United States in terms of national income are the main arguments of the so-called "people's capitalism" theory. But these lies can be easily exposed by quoting materials published by American officials and American bourgeois scholars.

　　The main basis for those who defend American capitalism to boast that the United States has "no exploitation" is nothing more than that the average weekly wage of American workers is 80 or 90 U.S. dollars, totaling more than 4,000 U.S. dollars a year, far exceeding the income of workers in some other capitalist countries. But when they blow their own horns like this, they completely ignore the high cost of living in American society; they do not mention that it is difficult for a worker in the United States to maintain his family's life even with an income of several thousand U.S. dollars a year. For example, the average family in the United States spends 60 to 70 U.S. dollars a month on rent alone, 17 to 40 U.S. dollars a day for a hospital room, and an average of 500 U.S. dollars to give birth to a child in the city... However, some statistical materials reveal what they are hiding. According to the survey materials of American bourgeois economist Heller in 1957, the minimum living expenses for a family of four in the United States are 5,830 U.S. dollars a year. However, according to the bulletin of the Federal Reserve Board in September 1958, 66% of American families did not reach this minimum income in 1957. The annual income of ordinary black families was even only 2,764 U.S. dollars, which is less than half of this minimum income.

　　In addition to the high cost of living, the extremely high labor intensity of American workers, their poor working conditions, and their lack of security are also things that apologists for the American capitalist system never mention. However, American monopoly capital mainly achieves the strengthening of the exploitation of workers through these means. For example, in order to squeeze more blood and sweat from workers, American capitalists are constantly carrying out so-called "time measurement, motion research, and work analysis" on workers' labor. Based on these studies, they have formulated a set of cruel "acceleration systems" and extremely high work quotas, which are widely promoted in various factories. This system not only greatly damages workers' nerves and physical strength, but also causes more and more work-related injuries due to poor working conditions. According to official U.S. statistics, there were 1.6 million work-related injuries in the United States in 1939, but in the first five years of the 1950s, it had increased to an average of 2 million per year. The number of deaths due to this each year is as high as 15,000.

　　But when American workers are thus strengthening their labor intensity, sometimes even paying with their lives, and creating more value for capitalists, the share they share from the value they create is getting smaller and smaller, and the share taken away by capitalists is getting larger and larger. According to official U.S. materials, from 1947 to 1957, the labor productivity of American industrial workers increased by 31%, but from 1945 to 1957, the real wages of American industrial workers only increased by 12% to 17%. During the same period, the profits of American companies after taxes almost doubled, from 8.3 billion U.S. dollars to 21.8 billion U.S. dollars. The increase in labor productivity, especially the increase in company profits, greatly exceeded the rise in workers' real wages. Isn't this proof that the degree of exploitation of American workers is more serious than before?

　　In summary, it is not difficult to see that both the relative impoverishment and the absolute impoverishment of the American working class are intensifying. Because the absolute impoverishment of the working class referred to by Marx does not mean that the absolute quantity of workers' food and clothing is shrinking, but that the increase in workers' wages is increasingly lagging behind the necessary expenses for workers to maintain their labor force, the degree of exploitation of workers is more serious, their lives and jobs are more insecure, and there are more cases of premature aging, disease, etc. This is the reality of American society.

　　Crises, Unemployment, and Economic Militarization

　　In fact, no matter how the heads of the U.S. government deny the impoverishment of the broad working people in American society, deny that social wealth is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few people, the contradiction between the huge productive forces of American monopoly capital and the increasingly relative shrinking of the domestic market is manifested in the most ruthless way. It is reflected in the fact that the productive forces possessed by American monopoly capital far exceed the purchasing power of the people in the domestic market, thus causing continuous production "surpluses"; causing long-term stagnation of social productivity in the United States, insufficient start-up of enterprises, continuous crises, and increasingly serious unemployment among workers. For example, from 1955 to 1959, the start-up rate of the American steel industry gradually decreased from 93% to a little over 60% on an annual basis. The civil aircraft manufactured by the aircraft manufacturing industry are only one-third of their output... In just fifteen short years after the war, the United States has experienced three economic crises: the crisis of 1948-1949, the crisis of 1953-1954, and the crisis of 1957-1958. After the war, not only did the number of crises in the United States exceed any other capitalist country, but its crisis cycle also became shorter and shorter. In the past six months, with the sharp drop in stocks on Wall Street, the decline in industrial production from stagnation, the drop in the start-up rate of the steel industry to about 50%, and the upcoming reduction in production in the auto industry, a new economic crisis is imminent.

　　Naturally, long-term economic stagnation will inevitably lead to chronic long-term unemployment and underemployment. For example, calculated according to the proportion of the number of unemployed to the total labor force, the unemployment rate in the United States has increased from an average of 3.9% in the ten years from 1946 to 1956 to more than 5% in recent years (the unemployment rate in August was 5.9%). Calculated according to the number of unemployed people, it has more than doubled compared with the early post-war period. Obviously, the development of unemployment will inevitably further shrink the domestic market, make the crisis more serious, and also make domestic class contradictions more acute.

　　In order to "get rid of" the crisis and maintain "prosperity," the American monopoly bourgeoisie uses the state machinery to desperately increase military expenditures and implement economic militarization. In the 1938-1939 fiscal year, the United States' direct military expenditure only accounted for 12.1% of the budget expenditure. However, since 1952, its direct military expenditure has accounted for about 60% of the budget expenditure. Calculated in U.S. dollars, it was 1.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1939, and about 400 to 45 billion U.S. dollars per year after 1952, an increase of forty times. This sharp increase in military spending has made the degree of militarization of the American economy incomparable to any imperialist country. As much as one-quarter of its industrial production is for military service.

　　Of course, this militarization of the economy will inevitably aggravate the imbalance of industrial development, greatly accelerate the development of military-related industrial sectors such as the electronics industry and the aircraft manufacturing industry, while the general civil industries such as textiles and food industries will be weak for a long time. Finally, many companies have to rely more and more on national military orders to maintain their business. Take the American aircraft manufacturing industry as an example, military orders generally account for more than two-thirds of their production. In individual companies such as "Boeing Aircraft Company" and "North American Airlines," military orders account for more than 90% of their total sales. Taking advantage of the generous profits provided by this military order, "General Dynamics Corporation," which manufactures electronic instruments, has expanded its assets and profits by nearly ten times in the ten years from 1945 to 1955! Other companies such as "General Motors Corporation" and "General Electric Company" have also made huge profits because they have a large number of military orders.

　　The militarization of the economy has thus further fattened the American large monopoly capital, but it has also made inflation in the United States more and more serious. The U.S. government's national debt broke through the 290 billion U.S. dollar mark at the beginning of this year, and the people's tax burden has become heavier and heavier. This has exacerbated domestic class contradictions and made the gap between the huge production capacity of monopoly capital and the narrow domestic consumer market more prominent.

　　Political Reaction and Decay

　　The rule of monopoly capital and the militarization of the economy will inevitably lead to political reaction and decay. In the United States, this is most obviously manifested in the fact that after the war, whether it was the Truman or Eisenhower government, all important positions related to foreign affairs, foreign economy, and military policy have been almost exclusively occupied by managers and chairmen of large companies. On the other hand, retired senior American military officers generally immediately take up positions as managers or chairmen of large companies after "retiring from officialdom." For example, the board of directors of the above-mentioned "General Dynamics Corporation" includes former U.S. Secretary of the Army Pace and six other former Deputy Secretaries or Assistant Secretaries of the Army. And 721 former generals of the U.S. armed forces are employed by the 100 largest arms companies. This close collusion between officials, generals, and big businessmen, with no distinction between them, will inevitably lead to favoritism and bribery within the government. The fierce infighting between the three branches of the U.S. military for budget allocations is also a reflection of the competition between large companies for military orders. The practice of financial oligarchs, arms magnates, etc. directly participating in government affairs has greatly strengthened the aggressiveness of American foreign policy.

　　In this case, it is not surprising that the U.S. government uses a series of economic methods such as gifts, subsidies, various tax exemptions, accelerated depreciation, loans, and export incentives to give monopoly capital various benefits and preferential treatment. But the situation is not just like this. In order to suppress the resistance of the domestic people, the reactionary state machinery of the United States also formulates various laws to suppress labor, and intensify fascist persecution, arrest communists and progressives. As soon as the war ended, the U.S. government announced the "Loyalty Order" in March 1947, passed the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law restricting workers' strikes in June of the same year, passed the Internal Security Act persecuting communists in 1950, established the Immigration and Naturalization Act in 1952, and passed the Landrum-Griffin-Kennedy Act suppressing and destroying trade unions in 1959. With the establishment of these fascist reactionary legislations, the U.S. ruling authorities carried out a series of suppressions, interrogations, imprisonments, deportations, loyalty tests, dismissals, and accusations of contempt of Congress and perjury to persecute American communist leaders and thousands of progressive or peace-advocating American citizens.

　　The Scale and Methods of Foreign Expansion

　　In order to get rid of difficulties, American monopoly capital is expanding outward more frantically. In this regard, it has not only established its huge economic empire through increasingly large capital exports, increasingly large raw material plunder, and occupation of commodity markets, increasing the proportion of its overseas profits in total profits from 9.2% in 1940 to 14.7% in 1956, but also its ambition to dominate the world has become stronger. Because it is impossible to ensure "global" plunder without establishing "global" hegemony.

　　On the eve of World War II, the total area of ​​territories, leased lands, and vassal states owned by the United States abroad was only 900,000 square miles, with a population of approximately 22 million. After the war, its sphere of influence abroad suddenly increased by more than ten times. There are more than 250 military bases occupied abroad alone. Almost the entire capitalist world is controlled by it to varying degrees. The number of troops stationed abroad has increased from less than 90,000 before the war to more than 1 million at present. It has not only forced Britain to hand over all its strategic bases in the Western Hemisphere, thereby gaining unique hegemony in this region, but also obtained maritime hegemony over the two oceans by occupying all important military strategic bases in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through its powerful two-ocean fleet (Sixth and Seventh Fleets). American military bases have been established and American armed forces stationed in all important strategic locations in Western Europe, North Africa, the Mediterranean, Central Africa, the Near East, South Asia, and the Far East. Even the British mainland has become its "unsinkable aircraft carrier."

　　The United States is not satisfied with establishing bases. It has also established four aggressive military blocs including more than 20 countries by establishing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Central Treaty Organization, and the ANZUS Council; plus the "Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance" including 20 Latin American countries and the Japan-U.S. "Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security," the United States has established military alliances with more than 40 countries and bound them to its chariot. It has signed so-called military "assistance" agreements with 42 countries.

　　While establishing military blocs, American imperialism also colludes with the most reactionary dark forces in the world and supports them as its puppets. Li Chengran of South Korea, Wu Tingyan of South Vietnam, Mendes of Turkey, Sakhidi of Iran, Somocha of Nicaragua, Batista of Cuba, Trujillo of Dominica... are the most prominent examples. Relying on these lackeys, American imperialism is even more rampant in harming people, carrying out colonial rule, and intensifying the plunder of foreign resources to expand its empire.

　　The huge colonial empire established by the American ruling authorities has thus reached an unprecedented level. Neither Caesar's ancient Roman Empire before Christ, nor Napoleon's Empire in the early 19th century, nor the British Empire later known as the "Empire on which the sun never sets," nor the Hitler Empire and Tojo Hideki's Japanese Empire during World War II can be compared with it. The American rulers also directly admit this. For example, former U.S. President Truman boasted: "Genghis Khan, Caesar, Napoleon, Louis XIV, and any other great leader, cannot be competent for the heavy responsibility that now falls on the U.S. President."

　　American imperialism is clearly carrying out the largest colonial expansion and colonial enslavement in history, but American officials have always tried their best to conceal this truth. As soon as World War II ended, former President Truman immediately announced in October 1945 that the direction of American foreign policy was "…no ambition to expand territory, and no selfish intentions. We have no plans to invade any country, large or small." When Eisenhower visited South America in March this year, he told U.S. embassy staff in Chile: "The United States has never increased an acre of territory at the end of World War II and the Korean War, and we have not sought benefits anywhere."

　　Why do the representatives of American imperialism dare to falsely claim that they are not robbers while they are robbing everywhere? Why do they dare to openly declare that they have never enslaved anyone while carrying out the most vicious plunder and oppression of other countries in history? This is because the new colonialism policy pursued by the United States after the war is indeed slightly different in form from the old colonialism policy. It does not use the naked direct colonial rule method, but uses "aid" as bait to carry out economic control, political bribery, and military treaty constraints to achieve the same purpose as the old colonialism. Therefore, it is not only more vicious, but also more insidious. Generally speaking, the aggressive methods of this new colonialism policy of the United States are nothing more than: (1) In the economic aspect, creating other countries' dependence on the United States, and then further controlling the economic lifeline of the other party. Here, the United States uses its monopoly position as the world's largest raw material importer (it consumes half of the raw materials in the capitalist world) and the largest exporter of manufactured goods to manipulate market prices, carry out unequal exchange, dump commodities, export capital, destroy other countries' national economy and national industries, and make them gradually fall into the backward situation of a single economy. Then, it uses the other party's poverty to provide enslaving "aid" loans, and takes the opportunity to sign various aggressive treaties such as "investment guarantee plans," "friendship, commerce and navigation treaties," and "exemption from double taxation" to guarantee and deepen the economic control of American private capital over them. (2) In the political aspect, it uses the urgent mood of the oppressed nations to demand independence and liberation, and raises beautiful signs such as "maintaining the democratic and free system," "maintaining independence," and "helping to get rid of poverty" to carry out political deception. At the same time, it misappropriates the name of the United Nations and interferes in the internal affairs of other countries with economic and military strength as its backing. When carrying out this interference activity, its consistent method is to support its own puppet regime and subvert governments that do not suit its taste. Finally, this formally independent country becomes its vassal state. (3) In the military aspect, it uses the pretext of preventing "communist threats" to carry out military occupation or semi-military occupation of other countries by providing military "assistance," signing military treaties, and establishing military bases, but on the surface it still allows the other party to retain formal "independence." This is very beneficial to the United States. It allows American imperialism not to bear the notoriety of colonialism in form, but to fully enjoy the benefits of colonialism, and not to annex an acre of land from the other party, but to be able to rampage on the other party's territory at will and obtain various privileges.

　　Endangering Peace and Adhering to the War Policy

　　The new colonialism policy of the United States thus mainly uses ruthless means of fighting without bloodshed to achieve its goals of aggression and expansion. But this does not exclude it from using war means when necessary to expand its territory and maintain its ruling position. Since the end of the war, the number of "local wars" openly conducted or secretly supported by American imperialism in other countries around the world is not small. For example, in order to realize its ambition to control Greece, American imperialism used a large number of weapons and materials to support the Greek reactionary authorities to suppress the revolutionary armed forces of the Greek people in the five years from 1944 to 1949. For the same purpose, it helped the Kuomintang reactionaries launch a civil war against the Chinese people in 1946. But this war finally ended in 1949 with the complete defeat of the Kuomintang reactionaries. From 1946 to 1954, in order to get involved in Indochina, the United States supported the French imperialists, who had repeatedly been on the verge of collapse, with weapons and materials in the French war of aggression against Indochina, which prolonged the war for eight years. From 1946 to 1949, for the same purpose, it supported the Dutch colonial army in launching a war against the Indonesian people, providing the former with all the weapons, equipment and training. But both wars ended in the defeat of the French and Dutch invading armies. In 1954, the United States armed and subverted the democratic government of Guatemala. In 1955, the United States instigated Nicaraguan troops to attack Costa Rica. In 1956, the United States secretly incited the Hungarian rebellion. In 1958, the United States carried out military provocations and war threats against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait. In the same year, the United States and Britain respectively dispatched armed forces to invade Lebanon and Jordan... What is particularly unforgettable is the three-year war of aggression waged by American imperialism in Korea. In this war, the United States dispatched one-third of its army, one-fifth of its air force, most of its navy, and the troops of its fifteen servant countries. On the Korean battlefield, American imperialism not only carried out the most barbaric burning, killing, and looting, but even carried out the inhumane bacteriological warfare. But despite this, this war still ended in the defeat of the United States. Of course, all this did not make American imperialism learn its lesson and abandon its means of aggression. Until recently, some American military and political leaders were still clamoring about not relaxing the expansion of military power for local wars while preparing for a full-scale war.

　　American imperialism has always regarded subverting and eliminating socialist countries as its basic national policy. The American ruling group does not hide this at all. Former U.S. President Truman announced the "containment policy" of militarily, economically, and politically blockading socialist countries as early as 1947. Later, this policy was further developed by Dulles into the "massive retaliation" policy and the "liberation" of Eastern Europe policy during the Eisenhower administration. The war of aggression against Korea, the armed occupation of Taiwan, our country's territory, and the incitement of counter-revolutionary rebellions in Hungary, all prominently demonstrated how hostile and hateful American imperialism is to the socialist camp. In order to prepare for the adventurous plan of destroying socialist countries, American imperialism has established a military encirclement circle from Europe, the Balkan Peninsula, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, to the Far East along the border of socialist countries, connected by one military base and missile launch site after another. For this purpose, it has not only organized military blocs in Western Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and the Far East, but has also expanded its military spending to the equivalent of twelve times that of Britain and thirteen times that of France. American imperialism is also actively reviving West German and Japanese militarism as its main accomplices in waging wars of aggression.

　　While actively preparing to launch an attack on socialist countries, American imperialism has never relaxed its activities of sabotage and subversion against socialist countries. The U.S. ruling authorities not only send a large number of spies and special agents into socialist countries every year to carry out sabotage activities through its Central Intelligence Agency, Naval Intelligence Agency, Army G-2 Bureau, Air Force Intelligence Agency, State Department Research Office, National Security Office, and other eleven global intelligence agencies, but also recently held a series of provocative activities such as "Captive Nations Week." This proves that American imperialism has been implementing Dulles' so-called "liberation" policy.

　　While trying to eliminate socialist countries, the American ruling group has consistently obstructed disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons after the war, opposed the settlement of outstanding international issues through peaceful consultations, and at the same time continuously intensified international tensions with "cold war" activities to create excuses for its intensified arms race activities. This makes American imperialism the main threat to world peace.

　　Since the situation of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind appeared in 1957, American imperialism began to change its diplomatic strategy. Especially since last year, the American ruling group has been trying its best to play the trick of false peace in order to confuse the people of all countries, but in fact it is intensifying the arms race under the cover of "peace." But American imperialism's trick of "false peace and real war" was exposed and completely dismantled not long ago due to its provocative act of U-2 aircraft invading Soviet territory and its crime of sabotaging the four-power summit. Since then, American imperialism has been even more blatantly engaged in arms expansion and war preparations. Some American military and political leaders have also advocated launching a "preemptive" war against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. And recently, the presidential candidates of the two parties in the United States have openly used clamoring for a "life-and-death struggle" with the socialist camp and guaranteeing that the United States will "achieve victory in the world" as their keynote.

　　However, this madness of American imperialism in foreign expansion does not indicate its strength, but its weakness. Because these aggressive activities appeared under the sign of the general crisis of capitalism, and were carried out against the background of the more developed decay and parasitism of American imperialism, its increasing isolation in the world, and its economic and political difficulties. Due to the increasing victories of socialist construction and socialist transformation in the socialist camp countries led by the Soviet Union, the strength of the socialist camp is booming, and the struggle for national independence, democratic freedom, and world peace is sweeping Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This makes it more and more difficult for American imperialism to carry out aggression and launch wars, and it is being beaten and bleeding everywhere. However, all reactionary forces will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history. The closer they get to death, the more frantic they will struggle. As the new economic crisis approaches, American imperialism has accelerated the pace of preparing for new adventures. However, parasitic, decadent, and dying American imperialism can never reverse its doomsday. The more it oppresses and exploits its people, the more it plunders and invades the world, and the more it pursues military adventures, the more it makes enemies for itself, and the more it forces more than 90% of the world's people to oppose it, thereby accelerating its own demise.

　　穷凶极恶的美帝国主义
　　张振亚
    战后十五年来，美国在国内外政策上的越来越走向反动，它的无止境的向外扩张，它的疯狂的扩军备战，已成为国际事务中最突出的现象，并日益严重地威胁着世界和平和人类的安全。这一情况同战后美国两大资产阶级政党和历届政府的更加趋向反动和腐朽、美国军人对政府政策的干预越来越大等分不开。但是更重要和更根本的还是美国财政寡头经济上的垄断性、寄生性和垂死性已发展到登峰造极的程度，美国社会的生产关系和生产力的矛盾越来越无法解决，因此竭力从加紧对外掠夺、对外扩张和扩军备战中寻找出路。
    当然，对于美帝国主义的这一最根本的反动经济基础，资本主义制度的辩护士照例总要矢口加以否认和掩饰。不过，只要对美国垄断资本的情况进行一番考察和分析，就可以发现美帝国主义政策的全面反动性是同它的整个经济和社会结构紧紧不可分的，绝不是任何个人意志所能转移和决定的。
      垄断和集中的进一步发展
    美国是当前资本主义世界最大的一个帝国主义国家。它在第二次世界大战中及其以后空前地膨胀起来，它对国内经济的垄断性也更加显著了。二百家最大的美国制造业公司在制造业的总销售额中所占份额已从1935年的37.7％增至1950年的40.5％及1955年的45.5％。四家制铝公司包办了全国的制铝工业，三家汽车公司控制了96％的小汽车生产，三大钢铁公司垄断了53.6％的钢铁生产……美国二百家大公司左右着全国的经济生活，而这二百家公司又为以洛克菲勒和摩根财团为首的八大财团所掌握。单是洛克菲勒和摩根两个财团1955年控制的资产就超过一千二百七十亿美元。相当于当时美国联邦政府一年预算支出的两倍！这一切都说明美国亿万富翁已怎样牢牢地把整个国家经济生活控制在自己的财政魔掌之中。
    尽管美国的财富和生产的集中已达到如此惊人的程度，美国垄断资本的代言人却编造出了一套美国“财产在扩散”的所谓“人民资本主义”的神话。这套神话以美国大股份公司作例，硬说握有这些大公司股票的工人和小生产者也是资本家。由于美国大公司发行的股票量特别大，于是就得出结论说：美国的大公司已属“人民所有”，从而美国的资本主义也就成了“人民资本主义”了。
    但是这种神话的荒唐却是很明显的。因为握有少量股票的人不可能因此就变成“资本家”。他们同掌握这些公司的大垄断财团根本不能同日而语。譬如“美国电话电报公司”虽然拥有一百四十万个股东，可是除了洛克菲勒财团和摩根财团的一小撮资本家以外，又有谁能任命这个美国最大的公司的经理和董事，并决定它的政策？何况，大公司的股票大都是掌握在少数大家族手中。单是八大财团之一的杜邦家族握有的股票就为所有美国靠挣工资为生的人的股票总和的十倍。
    美国垄断资本所以能异常迅速的膨胀是和他们在近几十年中从国内外市场上不断地获得大量的超额利润有关。特别是两次世界大战为美国带来的数以百亿计的军火利润以及战后美国政府扩军备战为他们所提供的大量超额利润，大大增加了他们的资本积累，从而促进了美国生产的集中和垄断。
    资本积累越来越膨胀，而国内市场又越来越无法容纳“过剩”资本，因此，美帝国主义就必然要向外扩张，垄断国外市场。这就造成了它的资本输出规模越来越大，对商品市场和原料产地的争夺也越来越凶猛。
    例如，第一次大战后美国国外的投资从1919年的七十亿美元增加到1930年的一百七十亿美元，每年对外投资增加约九亿美元。而在第二次大战后的十三年中，美国的国外投资从1945年的一百六十八亿美元增加到1958年的五百九十二亿美元，每年增加平均达三十二亿美元以上，即为战前的速度三倍强。
    就原料的掠夺来说，战前美国垄断资本本来已控制了美国以外资本主义世界已知石油蕴藏量的24.5％，已知铁矿蕴藏量的16.5％，已知铜矿蕴藏量的44.5％，已知铁矾土（制铝原料）蕴藏量的20.8％。而战后根据1952年前后的统计，美国在国外所控制的上述原料的比重分别增加为：石油约占二分之一，铁矿超过五分之一，铜占二分之一以上，铁矾土超过三分之一。
    在争夺海外市场、进行贸易战方面，美帝国主义也毫不松手。它利用战后初期西欧帝国主义国家出口一蹶不振的机会，大大增加了它在国际市场上的份额。战前1938年美国在资本主义世界总出口中所占的比重是11％，1947年增加到32％。近年来由于西欧经济迅速恢复，资本主义发展不平衡规律更为突出，美帝国主义的经济力量已大大下降，它在资本主义世界制成品出口中所占的比重已从1953年的26％下降到1959年的21.3％，但是尽管如此，它的出口量仍然相当于英国或西德出口的两倍，仍是资本主义世界最大的出口国。不仅如此，近年来由于美国私人资本输出的规模越来越大，美国在海外的私人公司制造的产品，已超过它本国出口的一倍，所以它对海外市场的依赖又绝不是它的出口所能衡量。这一切就使它成为远超过西欧帝国主义国家的资本主义世界最大掠夺者和最强大的垄断者。
    加强对国内工人的剥削
    美国垄断资本在加紧掠夺海外的同时，也大大加强了对本国劳动人民的压迫和剥削：各大工厂中加紧推行压榨工人血汗的“加快制度”，工人劳动条件日益恶化，他们过早的衰老和得病，他们的工资增长远落在公司利润增长之后，生活越来越没有保障。
    当然，有关美国劳动人民的遭受残酷剥削的情况，美国负责的官方人士照例总是要矢口加以否认的。艾森豪威尔今年2月访问巴西的时候就说：“马克思主义的鼓吹者企图贬低美国制度。他们说什么‘受剥削的群众’。的确，读过历史的人都知道，资本主义在初期是常常有剥削的，但是，如果硬说今天的美国经济生活中仍然存在着十八世纪和十九世纪初期的情况，那就荒谬可笑了。”尼克松去年7月访问苏联时也说：“世界上最大的资本主义国家美国从财富分配这个角度来看，最接近于在一个没有阶级的社会中大家都享受繁荣的理想。”
    宣传美国已经接近于是一个“没有阶级的社会”，“大家都享受繁荣”，美国工人已是“中产阶级”，美国在国民收入方面已发生了有利于低微阶层的“革命”，这都是所谓“人民资本主义”理论的主要论据。但是对于这些谎话，只要引用美国官方和美国资产阶级学者发表的材料，就能容易地加以拆穿。
    原来为美国资本主义辩护的人们吹嘘美国
  “没有剥削”的主要依据，无非是指美国工人的工资每周平均八、九十美元，合计一年达四千多美元，远超过其他一些资本主义国家工人的收入。可是他们在这样吹法螺的时候，完全不提及美国社会生活费用的昂贵；不提及在美国一个工人甚至一年有数千美元的收入也难于维持一家的生活。例如美国一般家庭每月仅房租费要六十到七十美元，住医院一天的房费要十七到四十美元，在城市中生一个孩子平均要花五百美元。……然而他们讳莫如深的事，却由一些统计材料所揭示出来。根据美国资产阶级经济学者海勒1957年的调查材料，美国四口之家一年的最低开支生活费用是五千八百三十美元，可是，根据美国联邦储备局1958年9月的公报，1957年美国66％的家庭达不到这个最低收入，普通黑人的家庭全年收入甚至仅为二千七百六十四美元，还不及这个最低收入的一半。
    除掉社会生活费用昂贵以外，美国工人的极高的劳动强度，他们的恶劣的劳动条件，他们的毫无保障等等也是美国资本主义制度的辩护人所绝口不提的。但是美国垄断资本加强剥削工人主要正是通过这些途径来实现的。例如，为了能从工人身上压榨更多的血汗，美国资本家对工人的劳动不断地进行所谓“时间测定、动作研究和工作分析”。根据这些研究他们制定了一套残酷的“加快制度”和极高的工作定额，在各工厂普遍加以推行。这种制度不仅使工人的神经和体力受到很大损耗，而且由于劳动条件不良造成越来越多的工伤事件。据美国官方统计，1939年美国工伤事件有一百六十万起，而在五十年代的头五年已增加到平均每年二百万起。每年因此而死亡者达一万五千人之多。
    但是当美国工人这样加强劳动强度，有时甚至付出他们的生命，为资本家创造出更多的价值的时候，他们从自己劳动所创造的价值中所分享的份额却越来越小，被资本家夺取的份额则越来越大。根据美国官方材料，从1947年到1957年十年中，美国产业工人的劳动生产率增加了31％，但是从1945年到1957年的十二年中，美国产业工人的实际工资只增加了12％到17％。同时期中，美国公司纳税后的利润竟增加了近两倍，从八十三亿美元增加到二百一十八亿美元。劳动生产率的增长，特别是公司利润的增长，大大超过了工人实际工资的上升，这难道不是正好证明美国工人受剥削的程度比以前更为加重了吗？
    综上所述，不难看出，美国工人阶级的相对贫困化和绝对贫困化都在日益加剧。因为马克思所指的工人阶级绝对贫困化并非指工人吃和穿的绝对数量在缩减，而是指：工人工资的增加日益落在工人维持劳动力的必要费用之后，工人受剥削的程度更为加重，他们的生活和职业更加没有保障以及更多地发生早衰、疾病等等。这就是美国社会的现实情况。
    危机、失业和经济军事化
    其实，不管美国政府首脑人物怎样否认美国社会中广大劳苦人民的贫困化，否认社会财富日益集中在少数人手中，美国垄断资本的庞大生产力同国内市场的日益相对缩小，这两者间的矛盾却以最无情的方式显示出来。它反映为美国垄断资本拥有的生产力大大超过国内市场人民的购买能力，从而造成不断的生产“过剩”；造成美国社会生产力的长期停滞，企业开工不足，危机不断发生，工人失业情况日趋严重等等。例如，从1955年到1959年，美国钢铁业的开工率，按年度计算，从93％逐步下降到60％多一点。飞机制造业所造的民用飞机，仅为其产量的三分之一……仅在战后短短的十五年中，美国就发生了三次经济危机：1948—1949年的危机、1953—1954年的危机和1957—1958年的危机。战后美国不仅发生危机的次数超过了任何其他资本主义国家，而且它的危机周期也越来越缩短。近半年中在华尔街股票猛跌、工业生产由停滞而下降、钢铁业开工率又跌到50％左右、汽车工业又要减产的情况下，新的经济危机已迫在眉睫。
    自然，长期的经济停滞必然造成慢性的长期失业和半失业。譬如按失业人数占全部劳动力的比例计算，美国的失业比例已从1946年到1956年十年中平均占3.9％增加到近几年来的一直超过5％（8月份失业比例为5.9％）。如按失业人口数字计算，目前已比战后初期增加了一倍多。显然，失业的发展必然使国内市场进一步缩小，使危机更为严重，同时也使国内的阶级矛盾更趋尖锐化。
    为了“摆脱”危机，维持“繁荣”，美国垄断资产阶级利用国家机器，拼命增大军事支出，实行经济军事化。1938—1939财政年度美国的直接军费支出只占预算支出的12.1％。但是，从1952年起它的直接军费支出一直占预算支出的60％左右。如果按美元数字计算，则1939年是十一亿美元，而1952年以后每年是四百到四百五十亿美元左右，计增加了四十倍。这种军费的激增使美国经济的军事化程度为任何帝国主义国家都不能与之比拟。在它的工业生产中竟有四分之一是为军事服务。
    当然，这种经济的军事化必然要加剧工业发展的不平衡，使同军事有关的工业部门，如电子工业和飞机制造业发展大大加速，而一般民用工业如纺织、食品等工业则长期疲弱。最后，造成许多公司不得不越来越依靠国家军事订货来维持它的业务。以美国的飞机制造业为例，军事订货一般要占它们生产的三分之二以上。个别公司像“波音飞机公司”和“北美航空公司”，军事订货竟占它们总销售额的90％以上。利用了这种军事订货所提供的优厚利润，制造电子仪器的“通用动力公司”在从1945到1955年的十年中，使自己的资产和利润扩大了近十倍！其他如“通用汽车公司”、“通用电气公司”也莫不因拥有大量军事订货而利市十倍。
    经济的军事化就这样更加养肥了美国的大垄断资本，但它也使美国的通货膨胀越来越加剧。美国政府的国债今年年初已突破了二千九百亿美元的大关，人民的税负也越来越沉重。这就加剧了国内的阶级矛盾，使垄断资本的庞大生产能力和国内狭隘的消费市场两者间的悬殊更形突出。
    政治上的反动和腐朽
    垄断资本的统治和经济的军事化必然要引起政治上的反动和腐朽，在美国，这最明显地表现为战后无论是杜鲁门或是艾森豪威尔政府，所有有关外交、对外经济和军事政策方面的重要职位已几乎全都清一色地由大公司的经理和董事长所包办。另一方面，美国的退职高级军人一般总是在“休官”之后就立刻出任大公司的经理或董事长。譬如在上述“通用动力公司”的董事会中就有美国前陆军部长佩斯和另外六个前国防部副部长或陆军部副部长。而一百家最大的军火公司则雇用着七百二十一名前美国武装部队的将军。这种官吏、将军和大商人的紧密勾结，混杂不分，就必然造成政府内部假公济私、贿赂风行。美国三军之间争夺预算拨款的激烈内讧，也正是大公司争夺军事订货的一种反映。金融寡头、军火大王等直接参与政府事务的做法，大大地加强了美国对外政策的侵略性。
    在这种情况下，美国政府通过奉送、补贴、各种免税条例、加速折旧、贷款、鼓励出口等一系列经济手法来给垄断资本以各种好处和优待，也就不足为奇了。但是情况还不仅这样。美国反动的国家机器为了镇压国内人民的反抗，还制订各种法令，对劳工实行镇压，并加剧法西斯迫害、逮捕共产党人和进步人士。战争一结束，美国政府1947年3月就公布了“忠诚法令”，同年6月通过了限制工人罢工的塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法，1950年通过迫害共产党人的国内安全法，1952年设立了移民和归化法，1959年又通过压制和破坏工会的兰德勒姆—格里芬—肯尼迪法案。随着这些法西斯性质的反动立法的建立，美国统治当局就进行了一连串的镇压、审问、监禁、放逐、忠诚测验、解雇以及提出有关蔑视国会和伪证罪的控告，来对美国共产党领袖以及成千上万的进步的或主张和平的美国公民进行迫害。
    对外扩张的规模和手法
    美国垄断资本为了摆脱困难，就更加疯狂地向外扩张。在这方面，它不仅通过越来越大的资本输出、越来越大的原料掠夺和商品市场的占有，建立了自己的庞大经济帝国，使它的海外利润在全部利润中的比重由1940年的9.2％增加到1956年的14.7％，而且它的称霸世界的野心也更加强烈了。因为不建立“全球性”的霸权，要确保“全球性”的掠夺自然是不可能的。
    第二次世界大战前夕，美国在国外拥有的领土、租借地和附庸国的总面积一共只有九十万平方英里，人口约二千二百万；战后，它的国外的势力范围一下子就增加了十几倍以上。单是在国外霸占的军事基地就有二百五十多个。几乎整个资本主义世界都在不同程度上受到它的控制。国外驻军从战前的不到九万人增加到目前的一百多万人。它不仅迫使英国在西半球交出了它的全部战略基地，从而使自己获得在这个地区的独一无二的霸权，而且还通过它的强大的两洋舰队（第六和第七舰队）和它对大西洋、太平洋上所有重要军事战略基地的占据取得了独霸两洋的海上霸权。在西欧、北非、地中海、中非、近东、南亚、远东等处所有重要的战略地点，都建立了美国的军事基地，并驻扎了美国的武装部队。连英国本土也变成了它的“不沉航空母舰”。
    美国并不以建立基地为满足，它还通过建立北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织、中央条约组织、美澳新理事会，成立了包括二十多个国家的四个侵略性军事集团；加上包括二十个拉丁美洲国家的“泛美联防公约”以及日美“共同合作和安全条约”，美国就同四十多个国家建立了军事同盟，把它们缚在自己的战车上。它同四十二个国家签订了所谓军事“援助”协定。
    在建立军事集团的同时，美帝国主义还勾结世界各国最反动的黑暗势力，扶植他们充当它的傀儡。南朝鲜的李承晚、越南南方的吴庭艳、土耳其的曼德列斯、伊朗的萨希迪、尼加拉瓜的索摩查、古巴的巴蒂斯塔、多米尼加的特鲁希略……就是其中最突出的例子。依靠了这些爪牙，美帝国主义就更加到处残害人民，进行殖民统治，加紧掠夺国外富源，以扩大它的帝国版图。
    美国统治当局所建立的庞大殖民帝国就这样达到了史无前例的程度。无论是纪元前凯撒的古罗马帝国，无论是十九世纪初的拿破仑帝国，以及后来号称“日不落帝国”的大英帝国，无论是第二次世界大战中的希特勒帝国和东条英机的日本帝国，远远不能与之比拟。对此，美国的统治者也直认不讳。譬如美国前总统杜鲁门就自吹自擂地说过：“成吉思汗、凯撒、拿破仑、路易十四以及其他任何一位伟大的领袖，都不能胜任现在落在美国总统身上的那样重大的责任。”
    美帝国主义明明是在进行着历史上规模最大的殖民扩张和殖民奴役，可是美国当权人物历来总是竭力掩饰这种真相。二次世界大战刚结束，前总统杜鲁门在1945年10月立刻宣布美国的对外政策方针是“……没有扩张领土的野心，也没有自私自利的企图。对于任何大小国家，我们俱无侵略的计划。”今年3月艾森豪威尔访问南美时在智利又对美使馆人员讲话说：“美国在两次世界大战和朝鲜战争结束的时候，从来没有增加过一亩领土，我们并没有在任何地方寻求好处”。
    美帝国主义的代表人物为什么竟敢在他们到处打家劫舍的同时，又诡称自己不是强盗呢？他们为什么在对其他国家进行历史上最凶恶的掠夺和压迫的同时，竟敢公然宣布自己从未奴役过任何人呢？这是因为美国战后推行的新殖民主义政策的确同旧殖民主义政策在形式上稍有不同。它不是用赤裸裸的直接殖民统治方式，而是以“援助”为诱饵来进行经济控制、政治收买、军事条约束缚以达到旧殖民主义所要达到的同一目的。因此它就不仅来得更凶恶，而且也更阴险。美国的这种新殖民主义政策的侵略手法一般说来，不外是：（一）在经济方面，造成其他国家对美国的依赖，然后进一步控制对方经济命脉。在这里，美国利用了它是世界最大原料进口国（它消费着资本主义世界一半的原料）和最大制成品输出国的垄断地位，操纵市场价格，进行不等价交换，倾销商品、输出资本破坏其他国家的国民经济和民族工业，使它们逐渐陷入单一经济的落后处境，然后利用对方的贫困，提供奴役性“援助”贷款，同时乘机与之签订各种“投资保证计划”“友好通商航海条约”“豁免双重税收”等侵略性条约来保证和加深美国私人资本对它们的经济控制。（二）在政治方面，是利用被压迫民族普遍要求独立和解放的急迫心情，打起“维护民主自由制度”、“维护独立”、“帮助解脱贫困”等漂亮招牌来进行政治欺骗。同时盗用联合国名义，以经济和军事实力为后盾，干涉别国内政。在进行这种干涉活动时，它的手法一贯是扶植自己的傀儡政权和颠覆那些不合它胃口的政府。最后使这个形式上独立的国家成为自己的附庸国。（三）在军事方面，是以防止“共产主义威胁”为幌子，通过提供军事“援助”、签订军事条约、建立军事基地的办法，对其他国家进行军事占领或半军事占领，但表面上仍允许对方保有形式上的“独立”。这对美国说来，好处是很大的。它使美帝国主义形式上可以不承担殖民主义者的恶名，但却完全享有殖民主义者的实惠，不吞并对方一亩土地，但却可以在对方领土上任意横行，取得各种特权。
    危害和平坚持战争政策
    美国的新殖民主义政策就这样主要是用兵不血刃的毒辣手段来达到它的侵略和扩张的目的。但是这并不排除它在必要时用战争手段来扩大自己的地盘和维持自己的统治阵地。战后以来，美帝国主义在世界各地公开进行或在背后暗中支持的对其他国家的“局部战争”，为数是不少的。譬如美帝国主义为了实现控制希腊的野心，在1944年到1949年的五年中曾用大量武器和物资支持希腊反动当局把希腊国内人民的革命武装镇压了下去。为了同样的目的，它在1946年又帮助国民党反动派发动了反对中国人民的内战。但这次战争终于在1949年以国民党反动派的全面失败而告结束。从1946年到1954年，美国为了染指印度支那曾在法国侵略印度支那的战争中以武器和物资支持了几度走到崩溃边缘的法帝国主义，使战争拖延了八年之久。1946年到1949年，为了同样的目的，它支持荷兰殖民军发动了反对印度尼西亚人民的战争，为前者提供了全部的武器装备和训练。但这两次战争都以法、荷侵略军的失败告终。1954年，美国又武装颠覆危地马拉民主政府。1955年，美国指使尼加拉瓜军队进攻哥斯达黎加。1956年，美国暗中煽动匈牙利叛乱，1958年，美国在台湾海峡对中国人民进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，同一年美国和英国又分别派遣武装部队侵犯黎巴嫩和约旦……特别不能令人忘记的是，美帝国主义在朝鲜进行的三年侵略战争。在这次战争中，美国出动了它的陆军的三分之一、空军的五分之一、海军的大部分，还有它的十五个仆从国家的军队。在朝鲜战场上美帝国主义不仅进行了最野蛮的烧杀抢掠、甚至还进行了绝灭人性的细菌战。但是尽管如此，这次战争仍以美国的失败告终。当然，所有这一切并没有使美帝国主义接受教训，放弃侵略手段，直到最近，美国的一些军政头子还是大事叫嚷：在准备全面战争的同时不要放松扩充进行局部战争的军事力量。
    美帝国主义从来就把颠覆和消灭社会主义国家作为它的基本国策。对于这一点，美国统治集团是毫不隐讳的。美国前总统杜鲁门早在1947年就宣布了从军事、经济和政治上封锁社会主义阵营国家的“遏制政策”。以后这个政策在艾森豪威尔政府任内又由杜勒斯进一步发展为“大规模报复”政策和“解放”东欧政策。侵略朝鲜的战争，武装霸占我国领土台湾和在匈牙利策动反革命叛乱，都突出地表现了美帝国主义对社会主义阵营是多么地敌视和仇视。为了给摧毁社会主义阵营国家的冒险计划作好准备，美帝国主义沿着社会主义阵营国家的边境建立了从欧洲、巴尔干半岛、地中海、中东直到远东的军事大包围圈，用一个接一个的军事基地、导弹发射场连接起来。为了这个目的它不仅在西欧、中东、东南亚和远东地区组织军事集团，而且还把自己的军费扩张到相当于英国军费的十二倍、法国军费的十三倍。美帝国主义还积极复活西德和日本军国主义作为它进行侵略战争的主要帮凶。
    在积极准备对社会主义国家发动进攻的同时，美帝国主义从来没有放松过对社会主义国家进行破坏和颠覆活动。美国统治当局不仅通过它的中央情报局、海军情报局、陆军G—2局、空军情报局、国务院调查研究室、全国安全处等十一个世界性的情报机构，每年派遣大批间谍和特务分子钻进社会主义国家大搞破坏勾当，而且最近还连续举行“被奴役国家周”一类的挑衅活动。这都证明美帝国主义一直是在执行杜勒斯的所谓“解放”政策。
    在力图消灭社会主义国家的同时，美国统治集团战后一贯阻挠实现裁军、禁止原子武器，反对通过和平协商解决悬而未决的国际问题，同时不断以“冷战”活动加剧国际紧张局势，以为它加紧进行扩军备战的活动制造借口。这就使美帝国主义成为世界和平最主要的威胁。
    自从1957年出现了东风压倒西风的形势以后，美帝国主义开始改变外交策略。特别是去年以来，美国的统治集团竭力玩弄假和平的把戏，以图迷惑各国人民，实际上则在“和平”烟幕掩盖下加紧扩军备战。但是美帝国主义的“假和平、真备战”的把戏，不久以前由于它的U—2飞机侵犯苏联国境的挑衅行为，以及它破坏四国首脑会议的罪行被揭露和完全拆穿了。从那以后，美帝国主义就更加明目张胆地进行扩军备战。一部分美国的军政头子还鼓吹要对苏联和其他社会主义国家发动“先发制人”的战争。而最近美国两党总统候选人在竞选中也公然以叫嚷同社会主义阵营进行“你死我活的斗争”、保证美国“在全世界取得胜利”作为他们的基调。
    可是，美帝国主义在对外扩张上的这种疯狂性，并不表明它的强大，而是表明了它的虚弱。因为这些侵略活动都是在资本主义总危机的标志下出现的，是在美帝国主义的腐朽性和寄生性更加发展，它在全世界日益陷于孤立，它在经济和政治上陷入重重困难的背景下发生的。由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造取得越来越大的胜利，社会主义阵营力量在蓬勃发展，而争取民族独立、民主自由、世界和平的斗争又席卷亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，这就使美帝国主义进行侵略和发动战争的困难越来越大，并到处碰得头破血流。但是，一切反动势力是不会自动退出历史舞台的。他们越接近死亡，就越要进行疯狂挣扎。随着新的经济危机日益迫近，美帝国主义更加紧了准备新冒险的脚步。然而，寄生的、腐朽的、垂死的美帝国主义绝不能挽回它的末路。它越是压迫和剥削本国人民、越是掠夺和侵略全世界、越是追求军事冒险，它就越为自己树敌，越加迫使全世界百分之九十以上的人反对它，从而加速自己的灭亡。
