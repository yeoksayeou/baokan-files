    Busy

    Now, we are busy every day, busy with innovation, busy with fighting drought, and busy with production. Why are we so busy? "Busy" means implementing the General Line and achieving high speed. High speed embodies the wishes of the people throughout the country and represents their most far-reaching interests. The people of the whole country have personally experienced the taste of poverty, and the backward situation has not been fundamentally changed. Backwardness leads to beatings and bullying. Who wants to slow down again? At the same time, imperialism still exists and occupies our Taiwan. They always want to bully us, so it is even more necessary to build our country into a great socialist power with modern industry, agriculture, science, and culture in the shortest possible time. Precisely because of this, not only am I "busy," and you are "busy," but the people of the whole country are "busy." This kind of "busy," illuminated by Mao Zedong Thought, for the high-speed realization of socialism, is an excellent phenomenon.
    This kind of "busy" was unimaginable in China's past and in capitalist countries. At that time, people were also "busy," but who were they "busy" for? Big capitalists and landlords were "busy" exploiting the working people, making their pockets "busy" and bulging. And the working people were also busy, but the result of their busyness was empty pockets, thin bones, and ultimately unemployment, bankruptcy, starvation, and a life worse than that of animals.
    But today our "busy" is the opposite of that in the old society and capitalist countries. We are "busy" for the establishment of a beautiful socialist and communist society. The result of our busyness is to bring ourselves a happier and more beautiful life.
    In socialist construction, all tasks are developing rapidly, but they will never be very balanced. Some are faster, some are slower. How should we view this? Should the fast ones be "busy" whipping the horse even harder, and the slow ones be "busy" catching up? Or should we hold back the fast ones to wait for the slow ones? There is no doubt that the fast ones should be busy whipping the horse even harder, and the slow ones should be even busier whipping the horse faster. In this way, the fast ones will be even faster, and the slow ones will catch up with the fast ones and surpass them. As long as everyone is so "busy," chasing after each other, and competing for advancement, it will continuously promote the high-speed progress of socialist construction. Conversely, if the fast ones are not "busy," they will slow down, and if the slow ones are not "busy," they will not be able to catch up with the fast ones. In this way, there will be no high speed.
    But being "busy" requires knowing how to be busy, not being busy in a chaotic way. If you are "grabbing at eyebrows and beard all at once, picking radishes and eggplants together" and are just busy in a confused manner, it will be counterproductive and you will not be able to achieve any results. So how should we be busy? In the midst of busyness, we must distinguish between the light, the heavy, the urgent, and the slow. That is to say, we must first be busy with the key tasks, distinguishing between the principal contradictions and the secondary contradictions. For example, there are many things that need to be done in the current production brigade, including raising pigs, accumulating manure, field management, arranging living arrangements, and grasping cultural, educational, and health work. To complete this and complete that, it is impossible not to be busy with any of them, and all of them must be moved forward. But there is always a center to things. We must first grasp the main contradiction—field management—because this is the issue of guaranteeing a bumper harvest in 1960. As long as you firmly grasp this center, no matter how busy you are, you will always be orderly, and the "busyness" will play a greater role.

    忙
    河北昌黎县卢龙城关公社社员  刘宝义
    现在，我们每天都在忙，忙革新，忙抗旱，忙生产。为什么要这样忙呢？“忙”就是要执行总路线，是为了实现高速度。高速度体现了全国人民的心愿，是全国人民的最长远利益。全国人民都亲身体会到贫困生活的味道，而且现在落后面貌也没有得到根本改变，落后会挨揍，会受欺侮，哪一个愿意再放慢速度呢；同时，现在帝国主义还存在着，还占领着我国的台湾，他们总想欺侮我们，就更需要用最短的时间把我国建设成具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义强国。正因为这样，不但我“忙”，你“忙”，而且全国人民都在“忙”。这种在毛泽东思想照耀下，为高速度实现社会主义的“忙”，正是极好的现象。
    这种“忙”，在中国的过去和资本主义国家是不敢想像的。那时人们也在“忙”，但那时在为谁“忙”？大资本家，大地主“忙”着剥削劳动人民，把腰包“忙”得鼓鼓的。而劳动人民也忙，但忙的结果是囊空如洗，骨瘦如柴，最后落个失业、破产，挨饥受饿，过着牛马不如的生活。
  　而今天我们的“忙”，同在旧社会和资本主义国家相反，我们是在为建立美好的社会主义和共产主义而“忙”。忙的结果，是给我们自己带来更加幸福、美好的生活。
    在社会主义建设中，各项工作都在迅速地发展，但是，总不会是很平衡的，有的快些，有的慢些，我们应当怎样看待呢？是快的“忙”着再加鞭，慢的“忙”着追上前呢？还是把快的拉住等慢的呢？毫无疑问，快的应该忙着再加鞭，慢的更要忙着快加鞭；这样一来，快的将会更快，慢的也会赶上快的，超过快的。只要大家都在这样“忙”着，你追我赶，互争先进，就会不断地推动社会主义建设高速度前进。反过来，如果快的不“忙”，就会慢起来，慢的不“忙”，更赶不上快的，这样，就不会有高速度。
    但“忙”的要会忙，不能乱忙。如果是“眉毛胡子一把抓，萝卜茄子一齐拿”瞎忙一顿，就会事与愿违，忙不出结果。那么怎么忙呢？在忙的当中要分清轻、重、缓、急，也就是说，要首先忙关键，分清主要矛盾和次要矛盾。如：当前生产大队的工作需要忙的事很多，既要搞养猪、积肥，又要搞田间管理，既要抓生活安排，又要抓文教卫生等等。要完成这个，又要完成那个，那个不忙也不行，那个都要往前闯。但是事情总有一个中心，首先要抓住主要矛盾——田间管理，因为这是保证1960年大丰收的问题。只要你狠狠地抓住这个中心，不管你千忙，万忙，总会有条不紊，就会使“忙”发挥出更大的作用。
