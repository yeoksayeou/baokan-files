Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 5th. Li Fuchun, representing the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a congratulatory speech at the Vietnamese Labor Party Congress today and read out the congratulatory telegram from the CPC Central Committee.

When Comrade Li Fuchun delivered his speech, the audience stood up and applauded thunderously. After Comrade Li Fuchun finished his speech, the audience stood up again and applauded warmly.

The full text of Comrade Li Fuchun's congratulatory speech is as follows: Respected Comrade President Ho Chi Minh, dear comrades:

Our delegation of the Chinese Communist Party, entrusted by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, on behalf of all members of the Chinese Communist Party and the entire Chinese people, extends the warmest fraternal congratulations to the Third Congress of the Vietnamese Labor Party, and through the Congress, expresses cordial greetings and high respect to all members of the glorious Vietnamese Labor Party and the heroic Vietnamese people.

The Vietnamese Labor Party is the inspirer, organizer, and leader of the Vietnamese people's revolutionary victory and the creation of a new life. Under the leadership of the Vietnamese communists headed by Comrade Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese working class, holding high the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism, united all the people and carried out a long-term, unyielding struggle for the Vietnamese national democratic revolution and socialist cause, and achieved great historical victories. The Vietnamese Labor Party has set a glorious example for the people's revolution in colonial countries.

The Vietnamese people had been oppressed by two great mountains of imperialism and feudalism for a long time. After experiencing a glorious and tortuous battle path, the heroic Vietnamese people overthrew the state power of the colonialists and feudal classes in August 1945 and established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This is the first nationally independent country in the colonial countries of Southeast Asia, led by a proletarian political party and established through armed uprising. This great victory greatly encouraged the fighting spirit of the oppressed nations all over the world and received their warm support.

The French imperialists and the counter-revolutionary forces of Vietnam were not reconciled to defeat. In order to re-establish the colonial system and feudal rule to enslave the Vietnamese nation, they launched a dirty war of aggression against the newly born Democratic Republic of Vietnam with the support of US imperialism. In order to defend national independence and democratic freedom, the Vietnamese communists mobilized all the people to take up arms and carried out a just war of self-defense. During the nine years of the sacred war of resistance, the Vietnamese Labor Party closely relied on the people, especially by launching and organizing peasants through land reform, consolidating and expanding the national united front, thus the revolutionary forces of the Vietnamese people greatly grew in the tempering of the flames of war, giving the French invaders an extremely heavy blow. The Vietnamese people shattered the conspiracy of American interventionists to expand the Indochina war and finally achieved the victory of reaching the Geneva Accords in July 1954, restoring peace in Indochina. The victory of the Vietnamese War of Resistance shows that under the leadership of a Marxist-Leninist party, an oppressed nation that has awakened and united is fully capable of defeating the reactionary forces of imperialism and defending its national independence!

After the restoration of peace in Indochina, the Vietnamese Labor Party advanced the revolution in North Vietnam, which was completely liberated, to a brand-new stage, which is to advance along the road of socialist transformation and socialist construction. Since 1958, on the basis of completing land reform and restoring the national economy, North Vietnam has implemented a three-year plan for developing and transforming the economy and developing culture. Socialist transformations of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce will be basically completed by the end of this year. With the development of socialist transformation and socialist construction, industry and agriculture in North Vietnam have greatly improved. At present, the total output of rice, the main crop in northern agriculture, has increased by more than double the highest output before the war, and the total output value of state-owned industries in 1959 increased sixteen times compared with the early days of the restoration of peace. Cultural, educational, and scientific undertakings in North Vietnam have developed rapidly, the people's awareness has greatly improved, and the people's lives have also been significantly improved. All of this shows the incomparable superiority of the socialist system over capitalism.

The Vietnamese Labor Party and the Vietnamese people have carried out unremitting struggles to realize the peaceful reunification of the country on the basis of independence and democracy. At present, South Vietnam is still under the rule of US imperialism and its running dog Ngo Dinh Diem clique. US imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique have tried every means to undermine the Geneva Accords, attempting to divide Vietnam for a long time and turn South Vietnam into a colony and military base of US imperialism. The people of South Vietnam, who are in a dire situation, have carried forward the glorious tradition of the August Revolution and the long-term war of resistance, and have taken various forms to carry out a heroic struggle for their own liberation and the reunification of the motherland. The Vietnamese Labor Party and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly oppose the struggle of US imperialism to undermine the Geneva Accords, and the great achievements made in consolidating socialist construction in the North have greatly promoted the national democratic revolutionary struggle of the people in South Vietnam, laying the foundation for the final realization of the peaceful reunification of the Vietnamese state.

The Vietnamese Labor Party and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have made significant contributions to the struggle against the imperialist policy of war, to the struggle to defend peace in Asia and the world, to the struggle to achieve peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and to the great struggle to support the national liberation of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The Chinese Communists are elated and encouraged by all the above-mentioned achievements made by the Vietnamese Labor Party.

Comrades! Your Congress is a congress for building socialism in North Vietnam and striving for the peaceful reunification of the country. The five-year plan discussed at this Congress shows that you will enter a new period of socialist construction. With the implementation of the five-year plan, North Vietnam will not only complete socialist transformation, but also initially realize socialist industrialization. At the same time, the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts will also be further developed. This will further strengthen and consolidate the strength of the North, and at the same time, it will lay a more solid foundation for the peaceful reunification of the entire country. Vietnam has always been a unified country. The Vietnamese people have lived on this unified territory for generations. The Vietnamese people will never allow imperialists and their running dogs to obstruct and undermine the reunification of the motherland. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique, which is willing to be commanded by US imperialism, will surely follow in the footsteps of the likes of Syngman Rhee, Menderes, and Nobusuke Kishi. The running dogs of imperialism have never escaped the fate of their demise. We firmly believe that through your Congress, the Vietnamese people will be more closely united around your Party, move in step, and with dauntless heroism and selfless labor spirit, carry out a tenacious struggle to build socialism, to realize the peaceful reunification of the entire Vietnam, and to build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic and prosperous Vietnam, and will surely achieve even greater victories.

Comrades! We, the Chinese people, are now under the inspiration of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the three magic weapons of the People's Commune. After achieving two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward in the national economy and completing the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, we are striving to achieve sustained, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in the future development of the national economy. Our goal is to build our country into a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in a not-too-long period of time. We firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people will be able to complete this great task. In the process of carrying out socialist construction in our country, we have continuously received the enthusiastic support of socialist countries and communist parties of various countries. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks for the support and assistance given to us by your Party and the Vietnamese people.

We are pleased to see that the friendly and cooperative relations between our two parties and countries have been further developed in recent years. Our two peoples have always had a long and traditional friendship. Both of our countries have been subjected to the brutal rule of imperialism in the past, and now some of our land is still occupied by US imperialism. Therefore, in the struggle against imperialism, especially against US imperialism, we always support and cooperate with each other. The relationship between our two countries is truly as close as lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe. In recent years, our mutual assistance and cooperation in political, economic, cultural, scientific and technological fields have been further expanded. At the same time, the unity of the two parties, based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, has also been greatly developed. We firmly believe that as time goes by, the unity and relationship between our two countries and two parties will become more and more developed and more and more consolidated.

Comrades! The current international situation is extremely favorable to us. The strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing stronger and stronger, the national democratic movement in Asia, Africa and Latin America is in full swing, the revolutionary struggle of the people in capitalist countries is rising, and the strength of the people of all countries in the world to defend peace is also increasing. On the contrary, there are many contradictions within imperialism and between them, and they are heading for disintegration. The fate of imperialism headed by the United States will not be too long. In the past year, in order to persist in promoting its policy of arms expansion and war preparation, US imperialism has tried to adopt more cunning deceptive tactics, releasing a smoke screen of peace, in an attempt to relax the vigilance of the people of all countries, paralyze and disintegrate the will of the people of all countries to fight against US imperialism. The Moscow Declaration pointed out that "the people of all countries in the world must maintain the greatest vigilance against the danger of war caused by imperialism." This is still of profound and great guiding significance to us. Of course, we steadfast Marxist-Leninists will not have any illusions about imperialism. As long as we communists constantly educate the masses, raise the masses, rely on the masses, unite all forces that can be united, and form a united front against imperialism headed by the United States and its running dogs, and wage a resolute struggle against imperialism and its running dogs, we will certainly be able to smash the imperialist policy of aggression and war, and defend world peace. The Moscow Declaration said: "The mighty forces of our time that are safeguarding the cause of peace are: the indestructible socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union; the peace-loving countries of Asia and Africa that stand on the anti-imperialist position and, together with the socialist countries, form a vast peace zone; the international working class, first of all its vanguard – the Communist Parties; the liberation movement of the colonial and semi-colonial peoples; the mass movement of the people of all countries for peace. Resolutely resisting the plotters of a new war are also the peoples of the neutral countries of Europe, the peoples of Latin America, and the masses of the people in the imperialist countries. The union of these powerful forces can prevent the outbreak of war."

In the current struggle against imperialism, it is extremely beneficial to recall Lenin's following teachings. Lenin told us that revisionist ideas are most likely to spread when the bourgeoisie changes its tactics. Lenin said, "The bourgeoisie's shift in tactics has caused revisionism to run rampant in the workers' movement, often turning differences within the workers' movement into open splits." The Yugoslav modern revisionists, in coordination with the tactics of US imperialism, are now desperately whitewashing US imperialism, frantically attacking Marxist-Leninists, and trying their best to provoke and alienate the unity between the communist parties of various countries, especially viciously slandering and vilifying all communist parties that adhere to Marxism-Leninism. This fact not only confirms once again Lenin's assertion that we have pointed out above, but also once again confirms the Moscow Declaration's point that modern revisionism is still the main danger in the current international communist movement and workers' movement. The Moscow Declaration said: "Modern revisionism attempts to slander the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, saying that it is 'outdated' and that it seems to have lost its significance for social development at present. The revisionists try to corrode the revolutionary soul of Marxism and undermine the confidence of the working class and the working people in socialism." Of course, Marxism-Leninism has always adhered to the struggle on two fronts. The Moscow Declaration said: "It is necessary to resolutely overcome revisionism and dogmatism in the ranks of the Communist and Workers' Parties." Dogmatism is divorced from the masses and divorced from reality. Without opposing dogmatism, it is impossible to guide our cause to victory. However, one must not abandon the basic theoretical position of Marxism-Leninism under the pretext of opposing dogmatism, and one must never allow revisionism to replace Marxism-Leninism. Marxism-Leninism is guiding us with its immense radiance from one victory to another, until the final complete victory. The great doctrine and revolutionary soul of Marxism-Leninism have not been outdated and will never be outdated.

Comrades! Our cause is great, our strength is strong, and our future is bright and wonderful. Let us hold high the banner of invincible Marxism-Leninism and the Moscow Declaration, and march heroically towards the bright tomorrow of all mankind – communism with full confidence!

Now, please allow me to read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Third Congress of the Vietnamese Labor Party. (See "Congratulatory Telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" in this column)

Congratulatory Telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

Dear Delegate Comrades:

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China hereby extends the warmest fraternal congratulations to the Third Congress of the Vietnamese Labor Party on behalf of all members of the Communist Party of China and the entire Chinese people, and expresses heartfelt sincere respect to all members of the glorious Vietnamese Labor Party and the heroic Vietnamese people through the Congress.

For thirty years, in order to overthrow the rule of imperialism and the oppression of feudalism, and to realize people's democracy and socialism, the Vietnamese people have closely united around the Vietnamese Labor Party headed by Comrade Ho Chi Minh, and have carried out unremitting heroic and extraordinary struggles against French and Japanese imperialists and their running dogs. In August 1945, the Vietnamese people victoriously overthrew the rule of imperialism and established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. When French imperialism made a comeback and launched a new offensive against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnamese Labor Party again led the Vietnamese people in a nine-year sacred war of resistance. The great Vietnamese people are invincible, and only imperialism can fail. In 1954, foreign aggressors finally had to agree at the Geneva Conference to restore peace in Indochina, and North Vietnam was completely liberated from then on.

After the restoration of peace in Indochina, the Vietnamese Labor Party actively led the people in North Vietnam to carry out a vigorous land reform movement and quickly restored the national economy, and then launched socialist revolution and socialist construction, and implemented socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, thus the industrial and agricultural production in North Vietnam has greatly increased, the people's mental outlook has changed rapidly, and the people's material life has also been significantly improved. During this period, the Vietnamese Labor Party also led the Vietnamese people in an unyielding struggle against US imperialism and its running dog Ngo Dinh Diem clique, for the peaceful reunification of Vietnam on the basis of independence and democracy. The Vietnamese Labor Party has made its own significant contribution to opposing US imperialism's undermining of the Geneva Accords, ensuring peace in Southeast Asia, to opposing US imperialism's policy of aggression and war, and defending world peace. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, like their own achievements, feel infinitely jubilant and encouraged by all the great achievements made by the fraternal Vietnamese people.

At a time when the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism surpass the forces of imperialism, we firmly believe that following the direction pointed out by the Third Congress of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the Vietnamese people will surely achieve even more brilliant achievements in the struggle to accelerate the socialist revolution and socialist construction in North Vietnam, in the struggle against US imperialism and its running dog Ngo Dinh Diem and to realize the peaceful reunification of the Vietnamese state, and in the struggle to defend peace in Asia and the world. The Vietnamese people's desire to build their motherland into an independent and unified country will surely be realized.

We congratulate the successful conclusion of the Congress and congratulate the Vietnamese Labor Party on making new contributions to defending the principles of Marxism-Leninism and to consolidating the unity of the international communist movement and the socialist camp.

Long live the unbreakable fraternal unity of the Chinese and Vietnamese parties and peoples!

Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    李富春代表中共中央在越南劳动党代表大会上致贺词
    越南劳动党为殖民地国家人民革命树立光辉榜样
    中越两国唇齿相依休戚与共，在反对美帝国主义斗争中互相支持和合作
    依靠群众，团结一切可以团结的力量，同帝国主义及其走狗坚决斗争，就能粉碎帝国主义的侵略和战争政策
    新华社河内5日电　李富春同志代表中国共产党中央委员会今天下午在越南劳动党第三次全国代表大会上致贺词，并宣读了中共中央的贺电。
    李富春同志致词时，全场起立，掌声雷动。李富春同志致词结束后，全场再次起立，热烈鼓掌。
    李富春同志的贺词全文如下：敬爱的胡志明主席同志，亲爱的同志们：
    我们中国共产党代表团，受中国共产党中央委员会的委托，谨代表中国共产党全体党员和全体中国人民，向越南劳动党第三次代表大会致以最热烈的兄弟般的祝贺，并且通过大会，向光荣的越南劳动党全体党员和英勇的越南人民表示亲切的问候和崇高的敬意。
    越南劳动党是越南人民取得革命胜利和创造新生活的鼓舞者、组织者和领导者。在以胡志明同志为首的越南共产党人的领导下，越南的工人阶级，高举起马克思列宁主义战无不胜的旗帜，团结了全体人民，为越南民族民主革命和社会主义事业，进行了长期的不屈不挠的斗争，并且取得了伟大的历史性的胜利。越南劳动党为殖民地国家的人民革命，树立了光辉的榜样。
    在越南人民的头上，曾经长时期地压着帝国主义和封建主义的两座大山。英勇的越南人民，经历了一段艰难曲折的光荣的战斗道路以后，在1945年8月，推翻了殖民主义者和封建阶级的国家政权，建立了越南民主共和国。这是在东南亚地区殖民地国家中由无产阶级政党领导的、经过武装起义而建立起来的第一个民族独立的国家。这个伟大的胜利，大大地鼓舞了全世界被压迫民族的斗争勇气，并且受到了他们的热烈支持。
    法帝国主义和越南的反革命势力并不甘心于失败。它们为着重新建立殖民制度和封建统治制度来奴役越南民族，就在美帝国主义的支持下，对刚刚诞生的越南民主共和国发动了肮脏的侵略战争。为着捍卫民族独立和民主自由，越南共产党人动员了全体人民拿起武器，实行了正义的自卫战争。在九年的神圣抗战中，越南劳动党紧紧地依靠人民，特别是通过土地改革，发动和组织了农民，巩固和扩大了民族统一战线，因而越南人民的革命力量在烈火的锻炼中大大地壮大起来，给予了法国侵略者以极其沉重的打击。越南人民粉碎了美国干涉者扩大印度支那战争的阴谋，终于在1954年7月，取得了达成日内瓦协议的胜利，恢复了印度支那的和平。越南的抗战胜利表明，在马克思列宁主义政党的领导下，一个已经觉醒和团结起来的被压迫民族，是完全能够战胜帝国主义的反动势力，保卫住自己的民族独立的！
    印度支那和平恢复以后，越南劳动党把完全解放了的越南北方的革命，推进到一个崭新的阶段，这就是沿着社会主义改造和社会主义建设的道路前进。从1958年开始，越南北方在完成土地改革和恢复国民经济的基础上，实行了发展和改造经济、发展文化的三年计划。农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，都将在今年底基本完成。随着社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业的发展，越南北方的工农业都有了很大的提高。现在北方农业的主要作物稻谷的生产总量，已经比战前最高年度的产量增长了一倍多，1959年国营工业的总产值比和平恢复初期增长了十六倍。越南北方的文化教育科学事业有了高速度的发展，人民的觉悟有了很大的提高，人民生活也得到了显著的改善。所有这一切，正是显示了社会主义制度具有资本主义无可比拟的优越性。
    越南劳动党和越南人民，为了在独立和民主的基础上实现国家的和平统一，进行了坚持不懈的斗争。现在，越南南方还处于美帝国主义和它的走狗吴庭艳集团的统治之下。美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团千方百计地破坏日内瓦协议，妄图长期分割越南，把越南南方变成美帝国主义的殖民地和军事基地。处于水深火热的悲惨境地中的越南南方人民，发扬了八月革命和长期抗战的光荣传统，采取各种方式，为争取自身的解放和祖国的统一进行了英勇的斗争。越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府坚决地反对美帝国主义破坏日内瓦协议的斗争，以及在巩固北方的社会主义建设事业上所获得的巨大的成就，都大大地促进了越南南方人民的民族民主的革命斗争，为最后地实现越南国家的和平统一打下了基础。
    越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府，在反对帝国主义的战争政策的斗争中，在保卫亚洲和世界和平的斗争中，在实现不同社会制度国家的和平共处的斗争中，在支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放的伟大斗争中，都作出了重大的贡献。
    中国共产党人对于越南劳动党所取得的上述的一切成就感到欢欣鼓舞。
    同志们！你们的这次代表大会，是在越南北方建设社会主义和为实现国家和平统一而斗争的大会。这次大会所讨论的五年计划显示，你们将进入社会主义建设的新时期。随着五年计划的实现，越南北方不仅将全部完成社会主义改造，并且将初步实现社会主义工业化。同时，政治战线和思想战线方面的社会主义革命，也将进一步发展。这样就将更加壮大和巩固北方的力量，同时也就为和平统一全国奠定了更为稳固的基础。越南向来是一个统一的国家。越南人民是世世代代生活在这个统一的国土之上的。越南人民绝不容许帝国主义者及其走狗阻挠和破坏祖国的统一。甘心受美帝国主义指挥的吴庭艳集团，一定会步上李承晚、曼德列斯、岸信介之流的后尘。帝国主义的走狗从来也逃不脱它的复亡的命运。我们深深相信，通过你们的这次代表大会，越南人民将更加紧密地团结在你们党的周围，整齐步伐，以大无畏的英勇气概和忘我的劳动精神，为建设社会主义，为实现全越南的和平统一，为建成一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南而进行顽强的斗争，并且必将取得更为伟大的胜利。
    同志们！我们中国人民，现在正在党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社三个法宝的鼓舞之下，在取得了国民经济连续两年的大跃进、提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标之后，努力争取在今后的国民经济的发展中实现持续的、更好更全面的跃进。我们的目的是要在不太长的时期内，把我们国家建设成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家。我们深信，在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的正确领导下，中国人民一定能够完成这个伟大的任务。在我国进行社会主义建设的过程中，我们曾经不断地得到了社会主义国家和各国共产党的热烈支持。我愿趁着这个机会，对于你们党和越南人民给予我们的支持和帮助，表示衷心的感谢。
    我们高兴地看到，近年来我们两党和两国的友好合作关系，有了进一步的发展。我们两国人民本来就有着悠久的传统的友谊。我们两国，过去都曾经受到帝国主义的残酷统治，现在都还有一部分土地，被美帝国主义侵占着。所以在反对帝国主义，特别是反对美帝国主义的斗争中，我们总是互相支持和互相合作的。我们两国之间的关系真正是唇齿相依，休戚与共的。最近几年以来，我们两国在政治、经济、文化和科学技术方面的互助合作是更加扩大了。同时，建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础之上的两党的团结，也有了更大的发展。我们深信，随着时间的转移，我们两国和两党的团结关系也将越加发展和越加巩固。
    同志们！当前的国际局势对我们是极其有利的。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量日益强盛，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动方兴未艾，资本主义国家人民的革命斗争正在兴起，世界各国人民保卫和平的力量也更加增强。相反的，帝国主义内部以及它们相互之间却矛盾重重，它们正在走向分崩离析。以美国为首的帝国主义的命运不会太长了。最近一年以来，美帝国主义为着坚持推行它的扩军备战政策，力图采取更为狡猾的骗人策略，施放和平烟幕，妄图借此来松懈各国人民的警惕，麻痹和瓦解各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争意志。莫斯科宣言指出，“世界各国人民对于帝国主义所造成的战争危险必须保持最大的警惕”。这对于我们仍然是富有深刻的重大的指导意义的。当然，我们坚定的马克思列宁主义者，对于帝国主义不会有任何幻想。只要我们共产党人不断地教育群众，提高群众，依靠群众，团结一切可以团结的力量，结成一个反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的统一战线，同帝国主义及其走狗进行坚决的斗争，我们就一定能够粉碎帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，保卫住世界和平。莫斯科宣言说：“维护着和平事业的是当代的这些强大的力量：不可摧毁的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营；站在反帝立场上并且同社会主义国家一起构成广大和平地区的亚非爱好和平的国家；国际工人阶级，首先是它的先锋队——共产党；殖民地和半殖民地人民的解放运动；世界各国人民争取和平的群众运动。坚决反抗新战争的策划的，还有欧洲宣布中立各国的人民，拉丁美洲的人民以及帝国主义国家的人民群众。这些强大力量的联合可以阻止战争的爆发。”
    在当前反对帝国主义的斗争中，回味一下列宁的下述教导是极其有益的。列宁告诉我们，当资产阶级变换它的策略的时候，最易引起修正主义思潮的泛滥。列宁说，“资产阶级策略上的转折，使修正主义在工人运动中间猖狂起来，往往把工人运动内部的分歧弄成公开的分裂。”南斯拉夫现代修正主义者配合美帝国主义的策略，现在正在拼命地为美帝国主义搽粉抹脂，疯狂地向马克思列宁主义者进攻，竭力挑拨和离间各国共产党人的团结关系，特别是恶毒地诽谤和污蔑一切坚持马克思列宁主义的共产党人。这个事实不仅是再一次地证实了我们上面所指出的列宁的论断，同时也再一次地证实了莫斯科宣言所指出的，现代修正主义仍然是当前国际共产主义运动和工人运动中的主要危险。莫斯科宣言说：“现代修正主义企图诽谤马克思列宁主义的伟大学说，说它是‘过了时的’，似乎目前对于社会发展已经丧失了意义。修正主义者力图腐蚀马克思主义的革命灵魂，破坏工人阶级和劳动人民对于社会主义的信心。”当然，马克思列宁主义向来是坚持两条战线的斗争的。莫斯科宣言说：“必须在共产党和工人党的队伍中，坚决克服修正主义和教条主义”。教条主义脱离群众，脱离实际，不反对教条主义，就不可能引导我们的事业达到胜利。但是，决不能够借口反对教条主义，而抛弃马克思列宁主义的基本理论阵地，决不允许以修正主义代替马克思列宁主义。马克思列宁主义正以它的万丈光芒引导着我们从一个胜利到另一个胜利，直到最后的完全的胜利。马克思列宁主义的伟大学说和革命灵魂没有过时，也永远不会过时。
    同志们！我们的事业是伟大的，我们的力量是强大的，我们的前途是光明美妙的。让我们高举起战无不胜的马克思列宁主义和莫斯科宣言的旗帜，满怀信心地向着全人类光辉灿烂的明天——共产主义英勇地迈进吧！
    现在，请允许我宣读中国共产党中央委员会致越南劳动党第三次代表大会的贺电。　（见本栏“中国共产党中央委员会的贺电”）
    中国共产党中央委员会的贺电
    亲爱的代表同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会谨代表全体中国共产党党员和全体中国人民，向越南劳动党第三次代表大会致以最热烈的兄弟般的祝贺，并且通过大会，向光荣的越南劳动党全体党员和英雄的越南人民表示衷心的诚挚的敬意。
    三十年来，越南人民为了推翻帝国主义的统治和封建主义的压迫，为了实现人民民主和社会主义，紧密地团结在以胡志明同志为首的越南劳动党周围，同法、日帝国主义者及其走狗进行了坚持不懈的英勇卓绝的斗争。1945年8月，越南人民胜利地推翻了帝国主义的统治，建立了越南民主共和国。当法帝国主义卷土重来，发动了对越南民主共和国新的进攻的时候，越南劳动党又领导了越南人民进行了九年的神圣抗战。伟大的越南人民是不可被战胜的，失败的只能是帝国主义。1954年，外国侵略者终于不得不在日内瓦会议上同意恢复印度支那的和平，越南北方从此获得了完全解放。
    印度支那和平恢复以后，越南劳动党在越南北方积极地领导人民进行了轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动和迅速地恢复了国民经济，接着又展开了社会主义革命和社会主义建设，实行了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，从而使越南北方的工农业生产，有了巨大的增长，人民的精神面貌有了迅速的改变，人民的物质生活也得到了显著的改善。在此期间，越南劳动党还领导越南人民，为反对美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳集团，为在独立和民主的基础上实现越南的和平统一，进行了不屈不挠的斗争。越南劳动党为反对美帝国主义破坏日内瓦协议，保障东南亚和平，为反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，保卫世界和平，作出了自己的重大的贡献。中国共产党和中国人民，对于越南兄弟人民所取得的一切伟大成就，就像对于自己的成就一样，感到无限的欢欣鼓舞。
    当此和平、民主和社会主义的力量超过了帝国主义力量的形势下，我们深信，遵循着越南劳动党第三次代表大会所指出的方向，越南人民必将在越南北方加速社会主义革命和社会主义建设的斗争中，在反对美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳和实现越南国家和平统一的斗争中，在为保卫亚洲和世界和平的斗争中，取得更为辉煌的成就。越南人民要求把自己的祖国，建设成为一个独立统一的国家的愿望，是一定能够实现的。
    我们祝贺大会的圆满成功，祝贺越南劳动党在为保卫马克思列宁主义的原则，在为巩固国际共产主义运动和社会主义阵营的团结事业中，作出新的贡献。
    中越两党两国人民牢不可破的兄弟团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结万岁！
                                  中国共产党中央委员会
