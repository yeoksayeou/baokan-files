(Our newspaper, Harbin, 17th dispatch) The people's communes in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, are seizing the time during the spare time of late-stage field management to prepare vegetables for this winter and next spring. They have already dried more than 200,000 jin of various dried vegetables.

Since the large-scale marketing of vegetables in early August, Baiquan County has adopted a method combining public canteens and the drying of vegetables by commune members' households, creating a mass upsurge in drying vegetables. The San Daozhen People's Commune in the county organized cooks, primary school students, and housewives to participate in the work of drying vegetables. In just three days, they dried more than 9,000 jin of dried vegetables such as zucchini, bean pods, and beet leaves. In order to speed up the progress of drying vegetables, the county also reformed and created more than 100 semi-mechanized tools such as vegetable peeling machines, seed removal machines, shredding machines, slicing machines, and dual-purpose slicing and shredding machines, which greatly improved work efficiency and accelerated the progress of drying vegetables.

    拜泉抓紧时机晒干菜
    本报哈尔滨17日电　黑龙江省拜泉县各人民公社抓紧后期田间管理的空隙时间，为今冬明春准备菜蔬，现已晾晒各种干菜二十余万斤。
    拜泉县从8月初蔬菜大量上市后，各地就采取了公共食堂晒和社员家家晒相结合的办法，掀起了群众性的晾晒干菜高潮。这个县的三道镇人民公社组织了炊事员、小学生、家庭妇女参加晾晒干菜的工作，仅三天时间，就晒出角瓜、豆荚、甜菜缨子等干菜九千多斤。为了加快晾晒干菜的进度，这个县还改革与创造了蔬菜去皮机、扣籽机、切丝机、切片机、丝片两用机等半机械化工具百多件，大大提高了工作效率，加快了晾晒干菜的进度。
