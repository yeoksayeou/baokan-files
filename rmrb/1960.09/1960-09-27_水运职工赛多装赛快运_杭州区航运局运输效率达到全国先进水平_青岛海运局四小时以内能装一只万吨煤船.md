Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 26th: Workers at the Hangzhou District Shipping Bureau in Zhejiang Province are engaged in a vigorous ship-to-ship competition. Since the beginning of this year, they have overfulfilled their transportation tasks of various production and construction materials every month. In August, the total ton-kilometers produced per horsepower of the bureau's ships reached 20,200, and the total ton-kilometers produced per ton of cargo barges reached 1,600, exceeding the target of 15,000 ton-kilometers per horsepower for inland river shipping advocated at the National Conference of Heroes, reaching advanced national levels.

The waterways in the Hangzhou District Shipping Bureau have many bends, shoals, and bridges, making it difficult to tow more and run faster. In order to catch up with advanced national levels under these poor conditions, the Bureau's Party Committee organized workers to go to Wuxi three times to learn from the advanced experience of the Wuxi Shipping Company, a national advanced unit, in carrying out ship-to-ship competitions. After returning, they immediately caught up. The No. 102 ship took the lead, proactively competing with the No. 6002 ship, a benchmark of the Wuxi Shipping Company. Cao Xingwen, the Party Committee Secretary, and Zhang Ming, the Bureau Chief, went to the No. 102 ship to experiment with new methods of inland towing transportation together with the crew. They experienced twenty-three experiments, overcoming difficulties such as shallow waterways, many shoals, and many bridges, creating "fast bridge crossing" and "side-slipping" towing methods. While ensuring the quality of transportation, the monthly horsepower production of the ship jumped from 28,000 ton-kilometers to 46,000 ton-kilometers, exceeding the monthly horsepower production of the Wuxi Shipping Company's No. 6002 ship by nearly one time, and completing the annual transportation plan six and a half months ahead of schedule. The Bureau's Party Committee immediately summarized the advanced experience of this ship in achieving high quality and high production, and a work team composed of leading cadres, technicians, and crew members from the No. 102 ship went to various ships throughout the bureau to impart advanced experience and conduct on-site technical demonstrations. The crews of the entire bureau launched competitions with the No. 102 ship, creating a wave of competition, learning, catching up, and helping each other between ships. After the ship-to-ship competition began, fourteen ships in the bureau caught up with and reached the advanced level of the No. 102 ship.

Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 26th: All staff of the Qingdao Maritime Bureau of the Shandong Provincial Department of Transportation, in the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel, have further strengthened port and station collaboration, and deeply carried out the socialist labor competition centered on improving loading and unloading and transportation efficiency and accelerating vehicle and vessel turnover, so that production has leaped again and again, and high production records have been constantly refreshed, with a 10,000-ton coal ship being loaded in no more than four hours.

Since the beginning of this year, the port's various production indicators have been rising rapidly. From January to August, the total number of employees decreased by 17% compared with the same period last year, but the port's throughput, freight volume, work team efficiency, and labor productivity have increased significantly; loading and unloading costs have decreased by more than 16% compared with the same period last year. Since the beginning of September, with the development of the movement to increase production and practice economy, various indicators have improved significantly again.

Since the beginning of this year, the bureau has mastered the method of comprehensive planning, breaking through key points, and driving the general, deeply mobilizing the masses, and widely carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution movements centered on "four modernizations," having already manufactured more than 3,900 pieces of various indigenous and foreign machinery, greatly improving labor efficiency.

After the launch of the movement to increase production and practice economy, the staff of the Qingdao Maritime Bureau immediately set specific indicators and launched a red flag competition centered on improving loading and unloading and transportation efficiency and accelerating vehicle and vessel turnover, and through the "three competitions a day" method of competing on plans and indicators before the shift, competing on methods and enthusiasm during the shift, and competing on results after the shift, the competition movement was rapidly pushed to a climax. The workers in the Dagang (Big Port) Operation Zone took the lead and first broke through the competition indicators. They used the "multi-way operation" method and on September 3rd created the latest record of loading a 10,000-ton coal ship in only 3.66 hours. The workers in the Zhonggang (Central Port) increased the average hourly loading capacity of salt from 45 tons to 85 tons, with a maximum of 116 tons, more than doubling loading and unloading efficiency, also creating a new record, through a joint performance competition. With the deepening development of the red flag competition, loading and unloading and transportation efficiency have been greatly improved.

　　水运职工赛多装赛快运
　　杭州区航运局运输效率达到全国先进水平
　　青岛海运局四小时以内能装一只万吨煤船
    据新华社杭州26日电　浙江省杭州区航运局职工开展轰轰烈烈的船与船竞赛。今年以来，他们月月都超额完成了各种生产建设物资的运输任务。8月份全局轮船马力月产二万零二百多吨公里，货驳船吨月产一千六百多吨公里，超过了有关方面在全国群英会倡议的内河航运每匹马力月产要达到一万五千吨公里的指标，达到了全国先进水平。
    杭州区航运局的航道湾多、滩多、桥多，不易多拖快跑。为了在这种条件差的情况下赶上全国先进水平，局党委组织工人三上无锡取经，虚心地学习了全国先进单位无锡轮船公司开展船与船竞赛的一整套先进经验。回来后，他们就急起直追。一○二号轮一马当先，主动和无锡轮船公司标兵船六○○二号轮对口竞赛。局党委书记曹兴文和局长张明，到一○二号轮船上与船员一起试验内河拖带运输新方法。他们先后经历了二十三次试验，冲破航道水浅、滩多、桥多等困难，创造了“快速过桥”和
  “边垮”拖驳法，在保证运输质量的前提下，轮船马力月产由二万八千吨公里跃进到四万六千吨公里，超过了无锡轮船公司六○○二号轮船马力月产量近一倍，并提前六个半月完成了全年运输计划。局党委立即总结了这艘轮船取得优质、高产的先进经验，并由领导干部、技术人员和一○二号轮船船员组成工作组，分赴全局各艘轮船传授先进经验，进行现场技术表演。全局船员纷纷与一○二号轮展开竞赛，掀起了船与船之间的比、学、赶、帮竞赛热潮。船与船之间开展对口竞赛后，全局有十四艘轮船赶上和达到了一○二号轮的先进水平。
    据新华社青岛26日电　山东省交通厅青岛海运局全体职工在以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中，进一步加强港、站协作，深入开展以提高装卸和运输效率、加速车船周转为中心的社会主义劳动竞赛，使生产一跃再跃，高产纪录不断被刷新，装一只万吨煤船不超过四小时。
    今年以来，这个港口的各项生产指标扶摇直上。1至8月份，职工总人数比去年同期减少17％，但是，港口吞吐量、货运量、工班效率和劳动生产率反而提高很多；装卸成本则比去年同期降低16％多。进入9月份以来，随着增产节约运动的发展，各项指标又有显著提高。
    今年以来，这个局掌握全面规划、突破重点、带动一般的方法，深入发动群众，广泛开展以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，已经制造了各种土洋机械三千九百多件，大大提高了劳动效率。
    增产节约运动展开以后，青岛海运局职工又立即订出具体指标，掀起了以提高装卸和运输效率、加速车船周转为中心的红旗竞赛，并且通过班前赛计划、指标，班中赛办法、干劲，班后赛效果的“一日三赛”的方法，使竞赛运动迅速推向高潮。大港作业区的职工一马当先，首先突破了竞赛指标。他们运用“多路作业”的方法于9月3日创造了装一只万吨煤船仅用三·六六小时的最新纪录。中港职工通过联合表演赛，使每小时盐的装舱量由四十五吨平均提高到八十五吨，最高达到一百一十六吨，装卸效率提高一倍以上，也创造了最新纪录。随着红旗竞赛的深入发展，装卸、运输效率都大大提高了。
