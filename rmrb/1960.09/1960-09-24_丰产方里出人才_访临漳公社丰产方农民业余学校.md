　　Talent Emerges from High-Yield Fields
　　A Visit to the Fengchanfang Farmers' Spare-Time School in Linzhang Commune
　　By Our Correspondent Huang Xiao

　　In August of this year, this reporter visited the Fengchanfang Farmers' Spare-Time School in the Linzhang People's Commune, Cixian County, Hebei Province. Their two years of experience have proven that the method of running schools by "fang" (squares or plots) closely integrates farmers' learning with production, and closely integrates the plan for cultivating agricultural talent with the needs of developing agricultural production. 72% of the land in the Linzhang People's Commune has been designated as high-yield "fang," and 98% of the young and middle-aged people have entered the "Red and Expert" schools in these "fang." In the past year alone, the commune has cultivated 120 agricultural talents with elementary technical skills. The development of running schools within the high-yield "fang" has promoted high yields of grain and cotton in the People's Commune, and produced a large number of talented people.

　　Scientific Activities in the "Fang" Fields

　　Let us start with the weather station in the "fang" fields. This small weather station is located in the middle of the high-yield experimental field of the "Red and Expert" school in the "fang." It can predict and record the temperature and humidity of the soil and air, the wind force, and the amount of rainfall. Then, through the commune's science station, it guides the field management of each "fang." In March, the weather station measured that the ground temperature had reached twelve degrees, and the sowing season for the entire commune began; in July, the rainy season was approaching, and the "fang" fields immediately carried out pruning, ditching, and repairing canals to prepare for drainage... Therefore, the commune members affectionately call it: "The weather station is the eye of the 'fang'."

　　Who is managing this "eye"? It is two students from the "fang" spare-time school, seventeen-year-old girl Li Shumei and eighteen-year-old young man Sun Bianjun. They are both graduates of higher primary school and, under the cultivation of the "Red and Expert" school in the "fang" fields, have now become "experts" in agricultural meteorology. Their learning method is not only to listen to lectures in the classroom, but more importantly to combine it with production practice and the production experience of veteran farmers, and learn in practice. The "fang" school, with the weather station as the center, holds a meteorological science conference every ten days. Participants in this conference include the "fang" leader, the head of the "fang" technical station, production pace-setters, and experienced veteran farmers. The young students of the "fang" school learn rich agricultural science and technology knowledge that is not available in books in such conferences, combining it with the practical problems of field management. In early July, students Li Shumei and Zhao Yu, during a cotton inspection in the Fengchanfang, discovered a small area of cotton leaves that were dry and withered. When they turned over the backs of the leaves, they found swarms of red spiders. They immediately followed the regulations of the "fang" for early treatment of pests and diseases: when red spiders are found, small patches should not be left untreated for more than a timely period, medium patches should not be left untreated for more than an afternoon, and large patches should not be left untreated for more than a day. They eradicated them on the spot, preventing the spread of red spiders in the ten-thousand-mu "fang" field.

　　Experimental Fields Combined with Scientific Research

　　Technical classes teach relevant basic knowledge in the classroom according to the needs of production, and then conduct operations, guiding practice with theory. The central "Red and Expert" school has designated one hundred and eighty mu of land as experimental fields for scientific research projects, high-yield fields, breeding new varieties fields, and model demonstration fields. This reporter entered a cotton experimental field, which contained various varieties of "Cotton King" - hybrid varieties of Duotao cotton and Daizi cotton, hybrid varieties of Sea Island cotton and Duotao cotton, grafted varieties of red cotton and Daizi cotton... and so on. These experimental varieties have now grown to more than one meter high and have produced twenty or thirty bolls. Small wooden signs were inserted here, marking the labor and learning achievements of the "Red and Expert" school students. One of the wooden signs read: "The experimental field of Dong Fengzhen and Secretary Yin." These three mu of cotton seem to be higher than the other nearby plots, the color is also deeper and greener, and the cotton bolls are more numerous and larger. Yin Jingxin is the agricultural secretary of the Linzhang Commune, one of the founders and supporters of the "fang" school. He and Dong Fengzhen, a student at the "fang" school, jointly planted this experimental field as a "base" for cultivating Dong Fengzhen. On the first day of entering the "dog days," Secretary Yin proposed topping the cotton. Dong Fengzhen saw that the cotton in other people's fields had not yet been topped, and said, "Is it too early to top?" "We can top in stages," Secretary Yin said, "Make several comparisons to see what happens. In the three mu of land, top part of it early and part of it late. If the land is strong and the cotton plants are growing vigorously, top early. Because the tip is the nutrient point and absorbs the most nutrients, if the nutrients are supplied to the tip, the cotton bolls will receive less nutrition and are prone to boll drop..." Dong Fengzhen followed Secretary Yin's advice and did so. Sure enough, the part of the cotton that was topped early had more bolls and less boll drop. During production, Secretary Yin told Dong Fengzhen in detail what the crazy branches and top tips of the cotton plants were; taught her how to cultivate, such as "first time digging pits, second time heaping soil, third time coming back and covering it all up," and "often peeling the bark in the dog days, plowing it again after autumn." These cotton-growing rhymes that summarized rich experience contain profound scientific principles. Dong Fengzhen not only learned production techniques and cotton-growing experience, but also combined these techniques and experiences with the scientific knowledge learned in the classroom, complementing and corroborating each other. In this way, Dong Fengzhen quickly became a cotton-growing expert with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience.

　　Students who are both Red and Expert

　　Qi Yuexia is a graduate of the first term of the "Red and Expert" school. After returning to her village, she served as the production team leader. Initially, when she requested to plant a cotton experimental field, some conservative people muttered secretly, saying, "What high yields can this young girl achieve after coming back from school for a few days?" Qi Yuexia ignored these comments and led seven sisters to plant five mu of experimental fields, putting all the skills she had learned in the "Red and Expert" school to use. By the time of the autumn harvest, the cotton had achieved high yields, thus gaining the trust of the masses in the first step. After the autumn, Qi Yuexia planted another five mu of high-yield wheat. This time, there were fewer people talking, but they were still waiting to see how capable the young people were. Qi Yuexia planted wheat in the same way as when she planted cotton, working carefully according to scientific principles, recording the growth of crops in each period, accumulating data, and summarizing experience. In early winter, when watering the wheat for frost prevention, the canal broke, and a torrent of water rushed towards the fields, towards the wheat fields. Qi Yuexia came to the canal break and immediately jumped into the water, regardless of her own safety, to block the breach. Large pieces of ice cut her legs like glass. She endured the cold and pain and fought against the ice water, finally leading the people to block the breach. This year, when harvesting wheat, Qi Yuexia's five mu of land again achieved high yields. This caused a sensation throughout the village, and they all said, "She didn't go to the 'Red and Expert' school for nothing; she is truly both red and expert!"

　　Soon, Qi Yuexia served as the deputy captain of the production brigade. The brigade captain had to manage the production and living problems of more than 2,600 people in the entire brigade, and had to manage more than 7,000 mu of land. Qi Yuexia ran from this canteen to that canteen, helping each canteen to arrange and plan for firewood, grain, oil, salt, and vegetables. How to ensure that the masses could eat their fill and eat well was a new task for Qi Yuexia. However, she enthusiastically cared for the lives of the masses. She went to each production team in turn, eating, living, working, and discussing with the masses. Soon, this daughter of a miner, a student trained by the "Red and Expert" school, and a female captain, became a cadre loved by the masses.

　　丰产方里出人才
　　访临漳公社丰产方农民业余学校
　　本报记者　黄晓
    今年8月，记者访问了河北省磁县临漳人民公社丰产方的农民业余学校。他们两年的经验证明：以方办校的方法，使农民的学习和生产紧密结合起来，使培养农业人才的规划，和发展农业生产的需要紧密结合起来。临漳人民公社72％的土地划进了丰产方，98％的青壮年进入丰产方的红专学校。仅在过去一年多的时间里，就为全社培养了一百二十名具有初级技术水平的农业人才。丰产方办学的发展，促进了人民公社粮棉高产，人才辈出。
    方田里的科学活动
    让我们先从方田的气象站说起吧。这个小小的气象站设在方田的红专学校高产试验田中间。无论土地、空气的温湿度，风力，雨量的大小，它都能预测和记录出来。然后，通过公社的科学站，指导各个方田的田间管理。3月，气象站测得地温已达十二度，全公社的播种期开始了；7月，雨季将要到来，方田立即进行了整枝打杈，挖沟修渠，作好排水准备……所以公社社员们亲切地称呼：“气象站是方田的眼睛”。
    是谁在管理着这双“眼睛”呢？是方田业余学校的两个学员，十七岁的姑娘李淑梅和十八岁的小伙子孙辨君。他们都是高小毕业生，在方田业余红专学校的培养下，如今成了农业气象学方面的“专家”。他们的学习方法，不仅是在课堂上听课，更重要的是结合生产实践，结合老农的生产经验，在实际中学习。方田学校以气象站为中心，举行每十天一次的气象科学会议。参加这种会议的有方田的方长，方田技术站的站长，生产红旗手，和经验丰富的老农民。年轻的方田学校的学员们，便在这种会议上结合田间管理的实际问题，学得了丰富的书本上没有的农业科学技术知识。7月上旬，学员李淑梅和赵玉在丰产方内进行棉花考察时，发现了一小片棉叶发干、萎黄，她们翻开叶的背面一看，有成群的红蜘蛛。她们立刻按照方田早治病虫害的规约：发现红蜘蛛时，小片不过时，中片不过晌，大片不过天的规定，就地消灭，防止了红蜘蛛在万亩方田内蔓延。
  和科学研究相结合的试验田
    技术课是根据生产的需要，在课堂上讲授有关的基本知识，然后进行操作，以理论指导实践的。中心红专学校将一百八十亩地，分别作为科学研究项目的试验田、高产田、培育新品种田和样板示范田等四大田。记者走进了一块棉花验试田，其中有各种品种的“棉花王”——多桃棉和岱字棉的杂交品种，海岛棉和多桃棉的杂交品种，红棉花和岱字棉的靠接品种……等等。这些试验品种，现在都已经长到一米多高，结了二三十个桃子了。这里插着各种小木牌，标明着红专学校学员们在这里劳动和学习的成绩。其中有一块木牌上写着：“董风珍和殷书记的试验田”，这三亩棉花看来要比其他邻近的高出一块来，颜色也更深，更绿，棉花也结得又多，又大。殷景新是临漳公社的农业书记、方田办学的创始人和坚持者之一。他和方田学校的学员董风珍一块种了这片试验田，作为培养董风珍的“基地”。入伏的头一天，书记就提出给棉花打顶了。董风珍看看人家地里都还没有打顶，便说：“打顶倒底早不早？”“咱们可以分期打顶”，殷书记说：“作几种对比试试看，三亩地里，早打一部分，晚打一部分。地有劲，棉株长得茂盛的，要早打顶。因为顶尖是营养点，是吸收养料最多的地方，养料供应了顶，棉桃就减少了营养，就容易落铃……”董风珍按照殷书记的意见作了，果然，早打顶的一部分棉花结桃多，落铃少。在生产时，殷书记详细地告诉董风珍那儿是棉株的疯杈，那儿是群尖、顶尖；教给她如何中耕，像什么“头遍坑，二遍壅，三遍过来一扑拢”呀，什么“伏天常剥皮，顶着秋后犁一犁”，这些总结了丰富经验的种棉的口诀，都包含着深刻的科学道理。董风珍不但学会了生产技术，种棉经验，还把这些技术和经验，和课堂上学的科学知识结合起来，互相补充，互相印证。这样，董风珍很快就成了一个既有理论知识，又有实际经验的种棉能手。
      又红又专的学生
    齐月霞是第一期红专学校的毕业生，回村后，担任了生产小队长。起初，她要求种棉花试验田，有些脑筋保守的人暗地里嘀嘀咕咕，瞧这个毛丫头，上几天学回来能创什么高产啊？齐月霞不听这些，她带领七姐妹种了五亩试验田，把在红专学校学会的本领全部施展出来了。到了秋收时，棉花获得了高产，这样，第一步取得了群众的信任。秋后，齐月霞又种了五亩高产小麦。这次，说话的人不多了，但还是等着看，到底年青人有多少本事？齐月霞种小麦也和种棉花时一样，按照科学的道理，精耕细作，记录下每一时期作物生长情况，积累资料，总结经验。初冬，给小麦浇冻水时，水渠决了口，眼看一股急流冲向田间，冲向麦地。齐月霞来到渠道口一看，立刻奋不顾身地跳下水去堵决口，大块的冰凌像玻璃一样把她的腿割破了。她忍着寒冷和疼痛和冰水奋战，终于带领人们，把决口堵住了。今年收割小麦时，齐月霞的五亩地又得到了高产。这一下，可轰动了全村，都说“人家可没有白上了红专学校，真是又红又专啊！”
    不久，齐月霞担任了生产大队副队长。大队长要管理全队二千六百多人口的生产、生活问题，要管理全队七千多亩地。齐月霞从这个食堂跑到那个食堂，挨个的帮助食堂安排、计划柴、粮、油、盐、菜。怎样使群众吃得饱，吃得好，这对齐月霞来讲是一件新的工作。但是，她热情地关心群众生活，她轮流到各个生产小队去，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。不久，这个矿工的女儿，红专学校培养出来的学生、女队长，就成了一个群众爱戴的干部。
