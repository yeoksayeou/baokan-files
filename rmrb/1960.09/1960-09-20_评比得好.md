	Emulation and Comparison Yield Good Results 	Wan Minglu

	The large-scale deployment of cadres to the front lines of agricultural production, and their settling down in production teams for a relatively long period, is a new phenomenon since the implementation of the "Two-Five" system in various regions. After the cadres went to the front lines, two situations emerged: one is that the cadres truly immersed themselves in the masses, and through eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses, they explored many good working methods and promoted the current tasks. The other is that although the cadres reached the grassroots level, they have not yet fully played their role due to insufficient understanding of the significance of going deep into the front lines of production or a lack of appropriate working methods. In such a situation, Party organizations should be good at adopting various methods to summarize the experiences of cadres who have done well in "four togethers" (吃、住、劳动、商量: eat, live, labor, and consult together) and motivate other cadres to continue moving forward. Timely inspection and comparison can achieve good results in this regard.

	To do a good job in the comparison and evaluation, it is necessary to mobilize cadres to start with checking and summarizing their work, examining their leadership style and working methods, and at the same time, it is necessary to widely mobilize the members to participate. Cadres who go deep into the front lines of production, labor and live with the members, so the masses see their advantages most clearly; the masses also understand their shortcomings best. Cadres who are praised by the masses will feel more honored, strive to develop their strengths, and continue to move forward; cadres with shortcomings will also be supervised by the masses, quickly correct their shortcomings, and quickly catch up with the advanced. At the same time, the participation of the broad masses in the comparison work will also educate the masses themselves, thereby enhancing their sense of ownership, making them love the cadres more, and further strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses.

	In the process of comparison, we must be good at developing various positive factors. It should be recognized that there are often some shortcomings in the advanced, rather than being perfect, and there are often some advanced factors in the backward, rather than being all bad. Therefore, cadres who are good in all "four togethers" and "five-good" cadres should of course be greatly commended and established as pacesetters; the achievements of cadres who have done well in "one together" or "two togethers," or "one-good" or "two-good" cadres, should also be affirmed, while pointing out their shortcomings so as to help them correct them. Only in this way can we, through comparison, more broadly mobilize the enthusiasm of cadres, so that they can participate in production and lead production with full confidence, and promote the continuous advancement of production and various tasks.

	With the deepening of cadres into the grassroots, more advanced figures and better experiences will continue to emerge, so the method of comparison should be used frequently to summarize and promote advanced experiences in a timely manner, so as to promote the advanced to become more advanced and the backward to quickly catch up with the advanced. Yi County has already created some good experiences in inspection and comparison, and it is believed that other places will also create new experiences in this regard.

    评比得好	万明鹿
    大批干部深入农业生产第一线，而且在一个比较长的时期内，在生产小队安家落户，这是各地推行“二五”制以来的崭新气象。干部深入第一线后，出现了两种情况：一种是干部真正深入群众，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量中，摸索出了许多好的工作方法，推进了当前的各项工作。一种是干部虽然到了基层，但因对深入生产第一线的意义认识不够，或者缺乏适当的工作方法，因而还没有充分发挥作用。在这样的情况下，党的组织就要善于采取各种办法，总结“四同”作得好的干部的经验，带动其它干部继续前进。及时地进行检查评比，就能在这方面收到良好效果。
    要把评比工作作好，需要发动干部从检查和总结工作入手，检查自己的领导作风和工作方法，同时，还必须广泛发动社员参加。深入生产第一线的干部，劳动、生活都和社员在一起，他们的优点，群众看得最清楚；他们的缺点，群众也最了解。受到群众表扬的干部，会感到更加光荣，努力发扬自己的长处，继续前进；有缺点的干部，也会受到群众的监督，尽快纠正自己的缺点，迅速赶上先进。同时，广大群众参加评比工作，对群众自己来说，也将受到教育，从而提高自己的主人翁感觉，更加热爱干部，使干部和群众的关系，进一步密切起来。
    在评比过程中，要善于发扬各种积极因素。应该认识，先进中也往往会有一些缺点，而不是完美无缺，后进中也往往会有一些先进因素，而不是样样都不好。因此，对于“四同”都好的干部、“五好”干部，当然应该大力表扬，树为标兵；对于“一同”、“两同”作的好的干部，或者是“一好”、“两好”的干部，也要肯定他们的成绩，同时指出其缺点，以便帮助改正。这样才能通过评比工作，更广泛地调动干部的积极性，使他们信心百倍地参加生产、领导生产，推动生产和各项工作不断前进。
    随着干部的深入基层，更多的先进人物和更好的经验还会不断出现，因此应当经常运用评比的方法，及时总结和推广先进经验，促使先进的更加先进，后进的迅速赶上先进。易县在检查评比中已经创造了一些好经验，相信其它的地方也将在这方面创造出新的经验。
