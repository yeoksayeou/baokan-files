　　A Bright Red Flag

　　The gongs and drums of the competition brought the good news of increased production: "The 4301 Youth Tunneling Team of the Jixi Chengzihe Coal Mine, holding high the red flag of high-speed tunneling, has completed this year's national plan 195 days ahead of schedule."

　　We warmly praise their brilliant achievements, and even more warmly praise their noble style: "Learn from the advanced and never be complacent, help the backward with all our might."

　　The level of style depends on the level of people's political and ideological consciousness and the attitude they take towards themselves and others.

　　In terms of attitude, towards oneself, no matter how great one's ability, how great one's achievements, how great one's creations, follow Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, be modest and prudent, and guard against arrogance and impetuosity at all times; this is the correct attitude, which can maintain a clear head and reach one victory after another. Towards others, no matter how difficult the object of assistance is, no matter how backward, be wholeheartedly loyal and do your best to help improve; this is the correct attitude, which can help other units raise their backward level to an advanced level.

　　All advanced ideas and advanced achievements are valuable assets of society, and their dissemination and popularization will bring progress to society. This is the reason why advanced individuals and advanced collectives receive social honor; this is also the reason why advanced individuals and advanced collectives are admired by people.

　　The style of the 4301 Youth Tunneling Team of the Jixi Chengzihe Coal Mine is one of countless noble styles on China's industrial front. A noble style will surely create brilliant achievements, and such a red flag will be even brighter and more glorious.

    一面鲜艳的红旗
    竞赛的锣鼓传来了增产的喜讯：“鸡西城子河煤矿四三零一青年掘进队高举高速掘进的红旗，提前一百九十五天完成今年的国家计划。”
    我们热忱地歌颂它们的辉煌成绩，更热忱地歌颂它们的高尚风格：“学先进永不自满，帮后进全力以赴”。
    风格的高低，取决于人们政治思想觉悟的高低和对自己、对别人采取什么样的态度。
    就态度而论，对于自己，不论自己有多大的本领、多大的建树、多大的创造，遵循毛泽东同志的教导，时时刻刻，谦虚谨慎、戒骄戒躁；这就是正确的态度，就能保持清醒的头脑，从一个胜利到达另一个胜利。对于别人，不论被帮助的对象有多大的困难，多么的落后，赤胆忠忱，全力以赴，帮助提高；这就是正确的态度，就能帮助别的单位把落后的水平提到先进的地步。
    一切先进思想和先进业绩，都是社会的宝贵财富，它的传播和普及，会给社会带来进步。先进人物和先进集体所以获得社会荣誉，原因在此；先进人物和先进集体所以受到人们的景慕，原因也在于此。
    鸡西城子河煤矿四三零一青年掘进队的风格是我国工业战线上无数崇高风格之一。崇高的风格必能创造辉煌的业绩，这样的红旗就更加鲜艳，更加光彩。
