　　Promote the Revolutionary Spirit of "Doing it Yourself"
　　Yu Zhangrui
　　"Self-reliance" and "ample food and clothing" are words inscribed by Comrade Mao Zedong for the Great Production Movement during the Anti-Japanese War. These eight characters have extremely profound political and economic significance. They centrally embody the revolutionary aspirations and spirit of the proletariat.
　　During the Anti-Japanese War, starting in 1941, the Party, government, army, and people launched a Great Production Movement of "doing it yourself," enabling the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the liberated areas behind enemy lines to achieve the goal of "overcoming difficulties" and "ample food and clothing," consolidating the liberated areas; and laying a material foundation for the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and subsequent Chinese People's Revolution, while also accumulating leadership experience for later economic construction, fully demonstrating the great revolutionary significance of "doing it yourself."
　　"Doing it yourself" means self-reliance and striving for progress. It is a working method and also a manifestation of revolutionary aspiration. Our revolution and construction should strive for external assistance as much as possible. This assistance was needed in the past and will be needed in the future. However, we are a country with a population of over 600 million. To build our country well, we cannot rely solely on assistance from others; we must rely on "doing it yourself." Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "We advocate self-reliance. We hope to have foreign aid, but we cannot rely on it. We rely on our own efforts, relying on the creativity of all our soldiers and civilians." ("Must Learn to Do Economic Work") From the perspective of an enterprise or a commune, we should, even more, adhere to the spirit of "doing it yourself," being diligent and thrifty, to build a socialist home and establish a socialist cause.
　　Marxism-Leninism believes that history is created by the people. Workers create social material wealth, thereby creating the foundation for the development of science, technology, and art. The people are not only creators of material wealth and spiritual culture but also the decisive force in social revolution. The contradiction between productive forces and relations of production, the contradictions between classes, the contradictions between the old and the new, and the contradictions between the advanced and the backward, drive human society forward. And the people play an active and decisive role in all these struggles of contradictions. In class society, the struggle of the exploited and oppressed people against the exploiting classes promotes the death of the old system and the establishment of the new system. Under socialism, the people have become conscious creators of history. The more the people's awareness and enthusiasm develop, the more socialist revolution and construction will develop. History proves that only revolutionary struggles in which the people actively participate can achieve victory. Therefore, Marxism-Leninism believes that the people liberate themselves. Believing that the people liberate themselves, believing in the endless creativity of the people, and therefore trusting the people and becoming one with them—this is the viewpoint of the historical materialist mass line, and precisely the basis for why we should especially emphasize "doing it yourself."
　　From the perspective of the origin of human knowledge, it has always been "doing it yourself." Knowledge comes from practice, or it can be said that it comes from "doing it yourself." If you don't go into the water yourself, you won't learn to swim; if you don't participate in productive labor, you won't know the actual situation of productive labor; if you don't personally participate in the practical struggle to transform reality, you won't understand the laws of social development and the laws of class struggle. Therefore, to lead a political movement well, leading cadres must go deep among the masses; to lead production well, leading cadres must go deep into production and participate in production. Countless vivid facts prove that participating in production, leading production, and discovering and solving problems from the practice of productive labor is the best and most important method of leadership. The reason why the "two-five system" leadership method of the Wuqiao County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hebei Province is correct, and the reason why their "learn, do, transform, help" work system has achieved very good results, is primarily because it conforms to the laws of human objective understanding.
　　Engaging in revolution and construction, whether it is "doing it yourself," working diligently, and striving for progress, or being a handout, only waiting for others to support, ultimately comes down to the question of whether one has revolutionary aspirations. Comrade Mao Zedong called on us: "Unite and struggle, and create a prosperous and strong country with our own hands." ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") People with revolutionary aspirations overcome difficulties with their own hands, turning poverty into prosperity. In the agricultural cooperativization and people's commune movements, in the large-scale establishment of people's communes and street industries in cities, and in the technical innovation and technical revolution movements centered on the "four modernizations," there are countless examples of "doing it yourself" and "starting from scratch."
　　The advancement of the revolutionary cause will always encounter various kinds of difficulties, large and small. The hands of revolutionaries are used to overcome these difficulties. In the face of difficulties, if one is bound hand and foot and evades reality, then one lacks revolutionary aspiration. Our country has a vast territory, and the north and south climates are very different. Every year, it is possible to suffer from several kinds of natural disasters of varying degrees. Some areas have suffered from drought this year. The broad masses of people with revolutionary aspirations have opened mountains and broken ridges, diverting water to irrigate fields, and have achieved significant victories in the struggle against drought. Sijiazhuang Village in Tangshan City, Hebei Province, suffered from floods last year, and production suffered losses, and life was somewhat difficult. Xing Yanzi, a member of the Communist Youth League in this village, was unwilling to see her production team always being poor and was determined to turn her disaster-stricken hometown into a land of fish and rice with her own hands. Finally, under the leadership of the Party, she overcame the disaster and changed the face of the poor team. It is precisely the millions upon millions of people with this high revolutionary aspiration who have propelled our socialist construction from victory to victory.
　　Our country has not yet escaped the situation of being "poor and blank," the enemy is still bullying us, and natural disasters are still threatening us. In

### 发扬“自己动手”的革命精神

　　发扬“自己动手”的革命精神
　　余章瑞
      “自己动手”，“丰衣足食”，是毛泽东同志在抗日战争时期为大生产运动题的字。这八个字具有极其深刻的政治意义和经济意义。它集中地表现了无产阶级的革命志气和革命精神。
    在抗日战争时期，从1941年开展了党政军民“自己动手”的大生产运动，使陕甘宁边区和敌后各解放区达到了“克服困难”、“丰衣足食”的要求，巩固了解放区；并为抗日战争乃至以后的中国人民革命的胜利奠定了物质基础，也为后来的经济建设积累了领导经验，充分显示了“自己动手”的伟大革命意义。
    “自己动手”，也就是自力更生，发愤图强的意思。它是一种工作方法，也是一种革命志气的表现。我们的革命和建设事业，应该尽可能争取外援。这种援助，过去需要，今后也是需要的。但是，我们是一个有六亿多人口的国家，要把我们的国家建设好，不能光靠别人援助，必须依靠“自己动手”。毛泽东同志曾经指出：“我们是主张自力更生的。我们希望有外援，但是我们不能依赖它，我们依靠自己的努力，依靠全体军民的创造力。”（《必须学会做经济工作》）从一个企业、一个公社来说，我们更应该本着“自己动手”的精神，克勤克俭，兴社会主义之家，立社会主义之业。
    马克思列宁主义认为，历史是人民群众创造的。劳动者创造了社会物质财富，从而为科学、技术和艺术的发展创造了基础。人民群众不但是物质财富和精神文化的创造者，也是社会革命的决定力量。生产力和生产关系的矛盾，阶级之间的矛盾，新旧之间的矛盾，先进和落后之间的矛盾，推动人类社会前进。而人民群众在所有这些矛盾斗争中，都起着积极的决定的作用。在阶级社会中，被剥削被压迫的人民群众起来反对剥削阶级的斗争，促使了旧制度的死亡，新制度的建立。在社会主义条件下，人民群众成了自觉的历史创造者。人民群众的觉悟性和积极性愈发展，社会主义革命和建设事业就愈发展。历史证明，只有人民群众积极参加的革命斗争，才能取得胜利。因此，马克思列宁主义认为：是人民群众自己解放自己。相信人民群众自己解放自己，相信人民群众的创造力无穷无尽，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，这就是历史唯物主义的群众路线的观点，也正是我们为什么要特别强调“自己动手”的根据。
    从人的认识起源来说，从来也是“自己动手”的。认识来源于实践，也可以说是来源于“自己动手”，自己不下水，就学不会游泳；不参加生产劳动，就不知道生产劳动的实况；不亲身参加变革现实的实践斗争，就不懂得社会发展的规律和阶级斗争的规律。因此，要领导好一项政治运动，领导干部必须深入群众；要领导好生产，领导干部就必须深入生产，参加生产。无数生动事实证明，参加生产，领导生产，从生产劳动的实践中，发现问题，解决问题，是最好最重要的领导方法。中共河北省吴桥县委的“二五制”领导方法之所以正确，他们所采取的“学、干、转、帮”的工作制度之所以取得很好的效果，首先正是由于符合人们认识客观的规律。
    干革命，搞建设，是“自己动手”，埋头苦干，发愤图强，还是当伸手派，专等别人支援，归根结底是一个有没有革命志气的问题。毛泽东同志号召我们：“团结奋斗，用自己的双手创造出一个富强的国家。”（《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》）有革命志气的人就是用自己的双手克服困难，变贫穷为富强的。在农业合作化和人民公社化运动中，在城市大办人民公社大办街道工业中，在以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动中，“自己动手”、“白手起家”的事例是多不胜数的。
    革命事业的前进，总会碰到各种各样大大小小的困难。革命者的双手就是用来克服这些困难的。在困难面前，如果束手束脚，逃避现实，那就是缺乏革命志气。我们国家幅员辽阔，南北气候有很大不同，每年都可能遭到若干种类程度不等的自然灾害。有的地区今年又遭到旱灾。广大有革命志气的人民群众开山破岭，引水灌田，使抗旱斗争取得了显著胜利。河北省唐山市司家庄去年遭到水灾，生产受到损失，生活有些困难。这个村的共青团员邢燕子不甘心自己的生产队老是受穷，决心要用自己的双手把连年遭灾的家乡变成鱼米之乡。终于在党的领导下，战胜了灾害，改变了穷队的面貌。正是千千万万具有这种高昂的革命志气的人，推动了我们的社会主义建设从胜利走向胜利。
    我们的国家还没有摆脱“一穷二白”的处境，敌人还在欺侮我们，自然灾害还在威胁我们。为了认真对付敌人的欺侮，为了有效地战胜自然灾害，把我国建设成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国，关键就是要继续发扬“自己动手”的革命精神，埋头苦干，发愤图强。过去，中国人民发扬这一精神，战胜了敌人，壮大了自己，达到了“克服困难”、“丰衣足食”等等目的。当前，全国人民正在响应党中央和毛主席的号召，埋头苦干，发愤图强，开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动。这就一定能够取得更加辉煌的胜利。
