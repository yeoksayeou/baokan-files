    Spend Money Where it Counts
    Sun Dade
    Not long ago, I saw a slogan next to an accountant's desk in a people's commune, which read: "Spend Money Where it Counts!"
    "Spend Money Where it Counts" is obviously derived from "Use Steel Where it Counts." Workers know that steel is hard-won and has special functions, so it should never be used for the back, handle, or body of a knife, but insisted on for the blade, so that steel can fully exert its strengths and also save the fruits of the steelworkers' labor. This accountant had a similar feeling to the workers, knowing that public funds, like precious steel, are the result of the masses' labor and must be cherished and spent frugally, so that every penny can play its due role. Therefore, he firmly put forward the requirement of "Spend Money Where it Counts" to himself.
    "Spend Money Where it Counts" and "Use Steel Where it Counts" are in line with the principles of Marxism-Leninism. Among the intricate and ever-changing contradictions, there must be a principal contradiction. Concentrating efforts to solve the principal contradiction is like grasping the main rope in a net; once the rope is lifted, all the meshes open. It is also like grasping the collar of a body; once the collar is lifted, the whole body rises. Therefore, grasping the principal contradiction and breaking through the principal contradiction is a principle that should be adhered to in all work. Spending money must also first serve the purpose of solving the principal contradiction, so that money can be spent where it is needed, and one penny can play the role of several pennies, and one penny can achieve the effect of several pennies. What we usually call the "blade" is precisely where the principal contradiction lies; "Spend Money Where it Counts" embodies the spirit of making fund expenditures serve the purpose of solving the principal contradiction. The "blade" is everywhere, but it also varies with time and place. Currently, the people of the whole country are carrying out a production increase and economy campaign centered on grain and steel. Concentrating all funds that can be concentrated to serve the increase of grain and steel production first should be an important symbol of "Spend Money Where it Counts."
    Regarding the benefits of "Spend Money Where it Counts," we will have specific experiences in our actual work and life. According to the accountant who posted the slogan next to his desk, he clarified this principle in practice. Before last autumn, there was no slogan like the present one next to his desk, and seeing that his brigade had harvested the autumn crops, he repeatedly suggested building a few spacious offices and buying a decent radio. However, the Party branch insisted on using the surplus funds to purchase sweet potato slicers, which were urgently needed by all the small teams. As a result, when digging sweet potatoes in the autumn, the entire brigade's sweet potatoes were sliced, dried, and stored in the warehouse in just a few sunny days. Starting from the very night when all the dried sweet potatoes were stored, there was a heavy rain for seven consecutive days. At this time, the commune members touched the snow-white dried sweet potatoes and said, "Fortunately, we spent the money where it counted, otherwise these dried sweet potatoes would have been sent to the dragon's mouth!" The words of the commune members took root in the accountant's heart. That night, he wrote the current slogan and posted it next to his desk, using it as a valuable experience to constantly warn himself and strictly demand that he act according to the slogan at all times. As a result, he has now become a "reliable accountant" praised by the masses.
    This accountant paid attention to summarizing experience from practice and used the valuable experience to guide his own practice. This spirit is commendable, and the experience he summarized is even more valuable. Because, in doing work and construction, some money must always be spent, and there is also a struggle of two ideas in spending money. Proletarian revolutionary fighters have always regarded thrift as an honor and waste as a disgrace. Not only in the hard years of revolutionary struggle did they insist on "saving every copper for the cause of war and revolution, for our economic construction, which is the principle of our accounting system," but also in the period of rapid economic construction, they still adhere to the principle that everything should be done diligently and frugally. Especially today, when the people of the whole country are striving to become stronger, burying themselves in hard work, being diligent and thrifty, and building the motherland, it is even more urgent and necessary to save every bit of fund that can be saved and use every penny on the "blade" of national construction. Therefore, the thousands upon thousands of accounting staff and the broad masses of cadres and people throughout the country should always think of the valuable experience summarized by that accountant, remember the clear slogan next to his desk, deeply imprint the words "Spend Money Where it Counts" in their hearts and put them into action, consciously oppose waste, promote thrift, and advocate using limited funds on the "blade" of national construction, so as to use the abundant fruits of our common savings to add more coal and gas to the rapidly developing socialist train and to continuously add bricks and tiles to the magnificent communist mansion.

### 把钱花在刀刃上

    把钱花在刀刃上	孙大德
    不久以前，曾在一位人民公社的会计桌旁，看到一条标语，上写：“把钱花在刀刃上！”
    “把钱花在刀刃上”，显然是由“把钢用在刀刃上”引伸而来，工人深知钢材来之不易，并具有特殊功能，因而决不用于刀背、刀柄和刀身，而坚持用于刀刃，使钢充分发挥它的特长，也节约了炼钢人的劳动结晶。这位会计也和工人有着相似的心情，知道公共资金和珍贵的钢材一样，都是群众的劳动成果，必须万分珍惜、节俭开支，使每分每文都起到应起的作用，因而坚定地向自己提出“把钱花在刀刃上”的要求。
    “把钱花在刀刃上”和“把钢用在刀刃上”一样，符合马克思列宁主义的原则。在错综复杂、变化多端的若干矛盾之中，必有一个主要矛盾，集中力量解决主要矛盾，犹如抓住网中之纲，纲一举而万目皆张；也如抓住全身之领，领一提而全身均起。所以，抓住主要矛盾，突破主要矛盾，是在各种工作中都应坚持的原则。花钱，也必须首先为解决主要矛盾服务，才能把钱花在当处，使一文钱起到几文钱的作用，一文钱收到几文钱的效果。而我们平时所说的“刀刃”，也正是主要矛盾所在；“把钱花在刀刃上”，也正体现了使资金开支为解决主要矛盾服务的精神。“刀刃”到处都有，却也因时因地而异。当前全国人民都在开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动，集中一切可能集中的资金，首先为粮、钢增产服务，应当是“把钱花在刀刃上”的重要标志。
    对于“把钱花在刀刃上”的好处，我们在实际工作和生活中都会有具体体会。据那位桌旁贴了标语的会计讲，他对这个道理就是在实践中明确起来的。去秋以前，他桌旁并没有现在的标语，而且看到他所在的大队秋收了，还一再建议盖几栋宽敞的办公室、买一架像样的收音机。党总支却坚持把节余的资金购买各个小队普遍急需的地瓜（甘薯）切片机。结果，秋刨地瓜时，几个晴天就把全大队的地瓜切好晒干入了库；而就从瓜干全部入库的当天晚上起，落了倾盆大雨，连下七天。这时社员摸着雪白的瓜干，都说：“幸亏把钱花在刀刃上，不然这瓜干还不都送进了龙嘴！”社员的话，在会计心里扎了根，当天夜里，就写了现在的这条标语，贴在桌旁，作为一条宝贵经验经常警诫自己，并严格要求自己时时都按标语行事，因而现在他也成了群众称赞的“放心会计”。
    这位会计注意从实践中总结经验，又以可取的经验指导自己的实践，这种精神是可贵的，而他所总结的经验就更为可贵。因为，做工作、搞建设，总要花一部分钱，而花钱中也有两种思想的斗争。无产阶级革命战士，一向都以节俭为荣，以浪费为耻。不仅在革命斗争的艰苦岁月里，坚持“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业，为着我们的经济建设，是我们的会计制度的原则”，而且在经济建设飞速发展的时期，仍然坚持一切事情都应当进行勤俭的原则。特别在今天，全国人民都在发愤图强，埋头苦干，克勤克俭，建设祖国，节省每一点可以节省的资金，把每一文钱都用在国家建设的“刀刃”上，这就更为迫切、更加需要。因此，全国千千万万的会计工作人员和广大干部群众，都应时刻想到那位会计总结的宝贵经验，记住他桌旁的鲜明标语，将“把钱花在刀刃上”这句话深印心底、见诸行动，自觉地反对浪费，提倡节俭，提倡把有限的资金用于国家建设的“刀刃”，以便用我们共同节约的累累果实，为风驰电掣的社会主义列车更多地添煤加气，为宏伟壮丽的共产主义大厦不断地增砖添瓦。
