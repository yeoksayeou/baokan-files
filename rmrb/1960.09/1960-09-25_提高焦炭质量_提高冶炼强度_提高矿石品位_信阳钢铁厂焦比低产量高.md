　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 24th: The employees of the Xinyang Iron and Steel Plant in Henan Province are doing everything possible to save coke. In August, the amount of coke consumed per ton of iron smelted by this plant decreased by 22.9% compared to July, and in the first half of September, it decreased by another 19.8% compared to August. In the first half of September, pig iron production increased by 30.9% compared to the same period in August, and the quality of pig iron also greatly improved. Various economic indicators have jumped to the forefront of the province's steel production.
　　This plant's reduction of the coke ratio starts from three aspects: improving coke quality, increasing smelting intensity, and improving ore grade. Guo Xingyuan, the secretary of the factory's Party committee, led department cadres to the front line to direct coking, solving the key problem of improving coke quality. In the past, this plant used circulating water to wash coal for coking due to insufficient water sources, and the washed coal still contained a lot of dust. Now they have dug a two-li-long water diversion ditch to draw clean water from afar to wash the coal, so that the ash content of the coking coal entering the furnace is reduced by 5% compared to the past. In coal blending, they also achieved skillful blending, hot charging, accuracy, and uniformity, thereby reducing coke ash content by 9.8%, sulfur content by 33%, and significantly improving the mechanical strength of coke. Due to the improvement in coke quality, the amount of coke consumed per ton of iron smelted has been greatly reduced. This plant has also improved the blast furnace's pipeline hot blast stove, increasing smelting intensity. In terms of ore, after ten selections from mining, sintering, and crushing, the grade has been improved. The plant strictly implements the raw material management system of "no sintering if the ore particle size is uneven, no furnace charging without testing, and no furnace charging if the ore is not clean and the grade is not high," thus achieving the goal of consuming less coke and smelting more iron.
　　The Xinyang Iron and Steel Plant has conducted ideological education for employees to love coal and coke as much as they love grain, establishing a fashion among employees of being proud of saving coking coal and not losing even an ounce. Recently, the employees dug out 4,000 tons of coal slurry from the sewage pool; used the coke powder saved since the establishment of the factory to make coke balls; the coking furnace used to use good coal to ignite the fire, burning 36 tons of good coal every day, but recently it was changed to burn coal slurry, saving 600 tons of good coal in half a month.

### 提高焦炭质量　提高冶炼强度　提高矿石品位　信阳钢铁厂焦比低产量高

　  提高焦炭质量　提高冶炼强度　提高矿石品位
　　信阳钢铁厂焦比低产量高
    新华社郑州24日电　河南省信阳钢铁厂职工千方百计地节约焦炭。这个厂8月份每炼一吨铁消耗的焦炭量比7月份降低了22.9％，9月上中旬又比8月份降低了19.8％。9月上中旬生铁产量比8月份同期提高30.9％，生铁质量也大大提高，各项经济指标已跃居全省钢铁生产的先进行列。
    这个厂降低焦比，是从提高焦炭质量、提高冶炼强度和提高矿石品位三个方面着手的。工厂党委书记郭兴源带领科室干部到第一线指挥炼焦，解决了提高焦炭质量的关键问题。过去这个厂由于水源不足，用巡回水洗煤炼焦，洗过的煤中仍含有许多灰尘。现在他们挖了一条二里长的引水沟，从远处引来清水洗煤，使入炉的焦煤灰分比过去降低5％。在配煤上又作到巧配、热装、准确、均匀，从而使焦炭灰分降低9.8％，硫分降低33％，焦炭的机械强度也有显著提高。由于焦炭质量提高，每炼一吨铁耗用的焦炭就大大减少。这个厂还改进了高炉的管道式热风炉，提高了冶炼强度。在矿石方面，从开采、烧结和破碎，也经过十次挑选，品位提高。全厂严格执行了“矿石粒度不匀不焙烧、不化验，矿石不干净、品位不够不入炉”的原料管理制度，因而达到了少耗焦多炼铁的目的。
    信阳钢铁厂对职工进行了爱煤爱焦如爱粮的思想教育，在职工中树立起了节约焦煤为荣、斤两不丢的风尚。最近，职工们从污水池中挖出煤泥四千吨；利用建厂以来存下的焦粉制成了焦球；炼焦炉过去用好煤引火，每天要烧好煤三十六吨，不久前改为烧煤泥，半个月就节约好煤六百吨。
