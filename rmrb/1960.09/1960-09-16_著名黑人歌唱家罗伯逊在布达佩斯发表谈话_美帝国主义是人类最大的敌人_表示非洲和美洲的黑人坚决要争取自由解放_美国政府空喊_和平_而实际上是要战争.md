Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, September 15th. The world-renowned Black singer Paul Robeson emphasized at a press conference in Budapest on September 14th that in recent years, he has come to realize even more profoundly that American imperialism is now the greatest enemy of mankind. He said that black people in Africa and America have long been enslaved by imperialism. Under the cruel plunder and oppression of imperialism, large numbers of black people have died. However, today, the people of Africa have awakened; they have had enough of imperialist oppression and enslavement.

He also said, "We are determined to strive for freedom and liberation today, not tomorrow. We are ready to dedicate ourselves to the cause of freedom at any time."

Answering questions from reporters, Robeson said that imperialism is doing everything possible to suppress the liberation movement of the African people, and people can clearly see through the imperialist conspiracy through the situation in the Congo. He pointed out that socialist countries and people all over the world love peace; while imperialism only shouts "peace" but in reality, the American Pentagon and NATO want war.

Speaking on the issue of disarmament, Robeson said that socialist countries advocate disarmament, but the problem is that imperialism will never do so. The American people want peace, but to achieve real peace, the current American government must be overthrown, and a government representing the interests of the people must be established.

Robeson said that he is a steadfast friend of socialist countries. In the future, he will spend six months of each year visiting and performing in various socialist countries.

He said very angrily: "My passport says that I am forbidden to go to the People's Republic of China, but I cannot tolerate this prohibition. I am determined to go to the greatest country in the world with more than 600 million people. Great China is building socialism and has always stood on our people's side. I will keep singing the song I sang, 'Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves...' (Reporter's note: he said this line in Chinese). I will break through all obstacles, no matter how they forbid me, I will go to China, to my homeland Africa, to Cuba..." Robeson also said that as an artist, he will always serve the cause of the people's struggle for freedom and liberation, and stand at the forefront of the people's struggle. He said that he will soon go to Africa for visits and performances.

Hungarian people from all walks of life, as well as Hungarian and foreign journalists, attended the reception. Robeson also sang folk songs from various countries at the press conference.

Robeson came to Hungary on September 9th for a visit and performance tour. The folk songs and revolutionary songs he sang in various parts of Hungary have been warmly welcomed by the audience.

    著名黑人歌唱家罗伯逊在布达佩斯发表谈话
    美帝国主义是人类最大的敌人
    表示非洲和美洲的黑人坚决要争取自由解放
    美国政府空喊“和平”而实际上是要战争
    新华社布达佩斯15 日电　世界著名的黑人歌唱家罗伯逊9月14日在布达佩斯的记者招待会上强调指出，最近几年来，他更加深刻地认识到，现在，美帝国主义是人类最大的敌人。他说，非洲和美洲的黑人长期被帝国主义奴役。在帝国主义的残酷掠夺和压迫之下，黑人大批地死亡。但是，今天，非洲人民觉醒了，他们受够了帝国主义的压迫和奴役。
    他又说，我们坚决要在今天争取自由和解放，而不是在明天。我们随时准备着为争取自由而献身。
    罗伯逊在回答记者向他提出的问题时说，帝国主义正在千方百计地镇压非洲人民的解放运动，人们通过刚果的局势，就可以清楚地看穿帝国主义的阴谋。他指出，社会主义国家和全世界人民是爱好和平的；而帝国主义只是空喊“和平”，实际上美国的五角大楼、北大西洋公约组织是要战争的。
    在谈到裁军问题时，罗伯逊说，社会主义国家是主张裁军的，问题是帝国主义绝不会这样做。美国人民是要求和平的，但是，要想取得真正的和平，就只有推翻现在的美国政府，建立一个代表人民利益的政府。
    罗伯逊说，他是社会主义国家坚定不移的朋友。今后他将每年用六个月的时间，到各个社会主义国家进行访问和演出。
    他非常气愤地说：在我的护照上写着禁止我去中华人民共和国的字样，但是，我不能忍受这种禁止，我坚决要到世界上最伟大的六亿多人口的国家去。伟大的中国正在建设社会主义，它一直是站在我们人民这一边。我要不断地高唱我唱过的“起来，不愿做奴隶的人们……”（记者按：这句歌词，他是用中文讲的）。我要冲破各种障碍，不管他们怎样禁止，我也要到中国去，到我的故乡非洲去，到古巴去……罗伯逊还说，作为一个艺术家，他将永远服务于人民为自由、解放而斗争的事业，站在人民斗争的最前线。他说，他不久以后将去非洲进行访问和演出。
    出席这次招待会的有匈牙利各界人士、匈牙利和外国的记者。罗伯逊在记者招待会上还演唱了各国的民歌。
    罗伯逊是9月9日来匈牙利进行访问演出的。他在匈牙利各地演唱的民歌和革命歌曲，受到广大听众非常热烈的欢迎。
