Commemorating the 15th Anniversary of the Victory over Japanese Militarism

    Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper, September 4th – Soviet newspapers published articles on September 3rd commemorating the 15th anniversary of the victory over Japanese militarism.

    The article stated that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, played a huge role in the struggle to defeat Japanese imperialism. The Chinese people carried out a long and heroic struggle against the invaders.
      Marshal Zakharov’s article, published in “Pravda,” stated that the United States is now doing everything it can to take Japan into its own hands and make it a tool of its aggressive policy in the Far East.
    The article emphasized that the historical lessons of World War II show that any intention of expansion is doomed to failure.
    Marshal Grechko’s article, published in “Izvestia,” stated that the Soviet army, the Chinese People's Armed Forces, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army, and the Korean guerrillas, in combat cooperation, defeated the Japanese army. This victory promoted the upsurge of the national liberation struggle of the Asian people.

    The article said that we have sufficient strength and means to repel any aggressor.
    An article published in the latest issue of "New Times" magazine said that the United States is using Japan's military machine and aggressive forces to carry out military adventures against the Soviet Union and China.
