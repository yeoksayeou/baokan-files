Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan – Workers at the Du'erping Coal Mine of the Taiyuan Xishan Mining Bureau are launching a "Four Advances" competition to ensure a sustained and even greater increase in production.

The content of the "Four Advances" is: preparation ahead of production, excavation ahead of extraction, transportation ahead of coal mining, and maintenance ahead of use.

In order to ensure that preparation and excavation work are ahead, the mine has drawn strength from all aspects and added three excavation teams. At the same time, machine and equipment installation forces were organized to prepare new working faces for two old working face coal mining teams that are about to finish mining, giving the extraction work initiative. For example, when the old working face of the Zhuangzhi Coal Mining Team in the West Mining Area was about to finish mining, the mechanical equipment on the new working face was installed.

In terms of maintenance, the entire mine recently conducted a mass inspection of machinery and equipment. Participating in the inspection were professional machine and equipment maintenance workers, as well as coal miners, excavators, and transporters. Liu Chengfu, the Party Committee Secretary of the mine, Yao Quanshui, the mine director, and section chiefs and other responsible cadres, all participated in the inspection of chain conveyor, belt conveyor, and electric vehicle transport lines together with the workers. Through this inspection, a large number of urgently needed machine equipment parts and components were replaced, and a spare parts system was established and improved. At the same time, each coal mining area also established small machine equipment spare parts warehouses and repair rooms in the well under sub-areas according to the requirements of the production teams, so that equipment maintenance work was ahead of use.

In the area of "transportation ahead," there have also been outstanding achievements. While not affecting unloading and loading, the workers improved the tippler equipment and extended the loading track at the fastest speed, so that the transportation department continued to play a leading role in the face of the surge in coal production.

　　杜儿坪煤矿开展“四赶前”竞赛
　　准备赶在生产前头　掘进赶在回采前头　运输赶在采煤前头　维修赶在使用前头
    新华社太原电　太原西山矿务局杜儿坪煤矿职工正在开展“四赶前”竞赛，以保证生产更大幅度地持续上升。
    “四赶前”的内容是，准备赶在生产前头，掘进赶在回采前头，运输赶在采煤前头，维修赶在使用前头。
    为了保证准备工作和掘进工作赶在前面，矿上已从各方面抽调力量，增加了三个掘进组。同时，又组织机器设备安装力量给两个将要采完的旧工作面采煤队准备好了新的工作，使回采工作取得了主动。如西采区的壮志采煤队当旧工作面快要采完的时候，新工作面上的机械设备就安装好了。
    在维修方面，全矿最近进行了一次群众性的机器设备大检修。参加检修的既有专业的机器设备维修工，又有采煤工，掘进工和运输工。矿党委书记刘成富、矿长姚泉水和科长等负责干部，都同工人一道参加了链板运输机、皮带运输机和电车运输线路等的检修活动。通过这次检修，更换了大批急需更换的机器设备零件、部件，并且建立和健全了备品备件制度。同时，各采煤区还根据生产小组的要求，在井下分区设立了小型机具备品备件库和修理室，使设备维修工作赶在了使用的前面。
    在“运输赶前”方面，也有了出色的成绩。职工们在不影响卸车装车的条件下，以最快的速度改进了翻车设备，延长了装车股道，从而在煤产量激增的情况下，运输部门继续发挥了先行的作用。
