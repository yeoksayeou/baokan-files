Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 23rd: The Lao Fighting Units Radio broadcast today that Sithon, a member of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, recently revealed the treasonous activities of the American imperialists in instigating Phoumi Nosavan to collude with Boun Oum Na Champassak to establish a so-called "Revolutionary Committee."

Sithon pointed out that "After the failure of the American imperialists' conspiracy to help the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group force the Phouma government to make concessions, they had to use Boun Oum Na Champassak as a new signboard." He said that the American imperialists believed that Boun Oum Na Champassak could deceive those who were already disgusted with Phoumi. This intention of American imperialism coincided with Boun Oum Na Champassak's dream of becoming emperor. Therefore, Boun Oum Na Champassak was willing to form the so-called "Revolutionary Committee" with Phoumi Nosavan.

Sithon said: When the Phoumi-Boun Oum rebel group is carrying out traitorous and harmful activities, they rely only on the weapons and money of American imperialism and some troops supported by Thai reactionaries and others. But in the struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys, we have the strength of the great unity of the whole people. The Lao territory is a whole, and the Lao nation is a whole. The Lao people will never allow them to split the motherland and alienate the Lao people of all ethnic groups.

Sithon said, "First of all, we must consolidate and expand the unity of the whole people. We must win over patriotic and peace-loving people among the people, soldiers, police, staff, and officials, and struggle for peace and neutrality, national harmony, and to crush the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak rebel group. The Lao Theung people (of Lower Laos) must carry forward the indomitable fighting tradition. The just struggle of the closely united Lao people will surely be victorious!"

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 23rd: According to a broadcast by Vientiane Radio, Lao Royal Government Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma told reporters on the 21st that Vientiane is still under economic blockade by Thailand. Lao goods are still being detained in Nong Khai (Thailand), and the rebel group's troops commanded by Lao reactionary officer Captain Siho are still scattered on the Mekong River bank belonging to Thai territory.

When talking about the situation in the provinces, Prince Souvanna Phouma said that almost all provincial governors and staff in Laos had telegraphed Vientiane to express their loyalty to the Royal Government.

According to a broadcast by Vientiane Radio, Phongsaly Provincial Governor Khamvan Boupha recently sent a telegram to congratulate the Phouma government and promised to be loyal to the Phouma government and to cooperate closely with the government.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 23rd: The Lao Fighting Units Radio revealed today the vicious conspiracy of the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak traitorous group to split Laos, overthrow the Royal Government, and usurp the throne.

The radio said that this traitorous group openly instructed provinces to send representatives to attend a meeting in Savannakhet to establish a "National Assembly" and formulate a "Constitution" separately.

The radio said that at the same time, they also forced provincial governors to establish so-called "Revolutionary Committees" in the provinces, and in particular to use their capable pawns - members of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" and some reactionary demobilized soldiers to form the so-called "Revolutionary Committees."

The radio pointed out that this behavior of the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak traitorous group is part of their conspiracy to split the motherland. They are plotting to overthrow the legitimate government of Phouma, abolish the constitution, and even usurp the throne.

The radio called on the Lao people to be vigilant and resolutely fight to prevent them from realizing this most brutal and dangerous conspiracy.

    老挝爱国战线党中央委员西吞发表谈话
　　谴责美国在老挝策动叛乱活动
    富马亲王指出泰国仍在支持诺萨万集团
    据新华社河内23日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员西吞最近揭露美帝国主义唆使文翁·纳占巴塞和富米·诺萨万狼狈为奸，成立所谓“革命委员会”的叛国活动。
    西吞指出，“美帝国主义在帮助富米·诺萨万叛乱集团迫使富马政府让步的阴谋失败之后，它不得不把文翁·纳占巴塞作为它所利用的新招牌”。他说，美帝国主义认为文翁·纳占巴塞能够欺骗那些已经厌恶富米的人。美帝国主义的这个意图同文翁·纳占巴塞要作皇帝的梦想正好相吻合。因此，文翁·纳占巴塞愿意和富米·诺萨万一起成立所谓“革命委员会”。
    西吞说：富米—文翁叛乱集团实行卖国殃民的勾当时，依靠的只是美帝国主义的武器和金钱以及为泰国反动派等支援的一些军队。但在进行反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争时，我们拥有全民大团结的力量。老挝国土是一个整体，老挝民族是一个整体。老挝人民绝不容许它们分裂祖国、离间老挝各族人民。
    西吞说，“我们首先必须巩固和扩大全民的团结，必须争取人民、士兵、警察、职员、官吏中的爱国爱和平的人，为和平中立、民族和睦，为粉碎富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛乱集团而斗争。（下寮的）寮厅族人民必须发扬不屈的斗争传统。紧密地团结的老挝人民的正义斗争一定会取得胜利！”
    新华社河内23日电　据万象电台广播，老挝王国政府首相富马亲王21日对记者说，万象仍然受到泰国方面的经济封锁，老挝的货物仍然被扣留在（泰国的）廊开，老挝反动军官西何大尉指挥的叛乱集团的军队仍然散布在属于泰国领土的湄公河岸。
    富马亲王在谈到各省情况时说，几乎老挝所有各省省长和职员都打电报给万象表示忠于王国政府。
    据万象电台广播，丰沙里省长坎万·布发最近电贺富马政府，并保证忠于富马政府，愿同政府密切合作。
    新华社河内23日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天揭露富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛国集团企图分裂老挝、推翻王国政府、篡夺王位的狠毒阴谋。
    电台说，这个叛国集团公然指示各省派代表参加在沙湾拿吉举行的会议，以便单独成立“国会”，制订“宪法”。
    电台说，同时，它们还硬要各省省长在各省成立所谓“革命委员会”，并且特别要起用它们得力的爪牙——“保卫国家利益委员会”会员和部分反动的复员军人组成所谓“革命委员会”。
    电台指出，富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛国集团这一行为，是它们分裂祖国阴谋的一部分，他们阴谋推翻富马合法政府，取消宪法，而且还要篡夺王位。
    电台号召老挝人民必须提高警惕，坚决斗争，以阻止它们实现这个最残暴、最危险的阴谋。
