Xinhua News Agency, September 24th, Vientiane dispatch: Following the setbacks suffered by the Phoumi Nosavan group's military offensive against Vientiane, the U.S. Embassy in Laos is intensifying its activities to directly interfere in Laotian internal affairs. According to the Associated Press, U.S. Ambassador to Laos Brown made a "hurried" "visit" to the King of Laos in Luang Prabang on the 23rd and sent two U.S. Embassy officials to Savannakhet, the headquarters of the Phoumi Nosavan traitor group, for a lightning "visit."

The United States' impatient actions to directly interfere in Laotian internal affairs are taking place while it is deploying troops in the South China Sea to threaten Laos and directing the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and Thailand to interfere in Laotian internal affairs.

According to the Associated Press, during Brown's so-called "purely routine" visit to the King of Laos in Luang Prabang, he had a "long conversation" with the King. Brown told the King that the U.S. government was "concerned" about the situation in Laos and expressed hope that a solution to the situation in Laos would be found in the near future.

It is revealed that on the same day, two U.S. Embassy officials colluded with the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Naciamphasak traitor group in Savannakhet to plot the overthrow of the Souvanna Phouma government.

Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: According to an Associated Press Vientiane dispatch, Lao Kingdom government officials announced that the Thai Embassy Counselor to Laos, Lun Hopong, was arrested on the evening of the 21st on the Laotian border adjacent to Thailand. He was carrying important military intelligence, including detailed information on the defense of Vientiane and suggestions for possible offensives.

This is further ironclad proof that the Thai reactionary government of Sarit Thanarat has recently stepped up its planning for armed intervention in Laos.

    泰国使馆参赞刺探老挝军情潜越国境已被逮捕
    新华社24日讯　万象消息：在富米·诺萨万集团军事进攻万象遭到打击之后，美国驻老挝大使馆正在加紧直接干涉老挝内政的活动。据美联社报道，美国驻老挝大使布朗23日到琅勃拉邦对老挝国王进行了一次“匆忙”的“访问”，并且派了两名美国大使馆的官员到富米·诺萨万叛国集团的总部沙湾拿吉进行了一次闪电式的“访问”。
    美国迫不及待的直接干涉老挝内政的行动，是在它陈兵南中国海对老挝进行威胁、指使东南亚侵略集团和泰国干涉老挝内政的同时进行的。
    据美联社报道，布朗去琅勃拉邦对老挝国王进行的所谓“纯粹是一次例行”的访问中，曾经同国王进行了“长谈”。布朗对国王说，美国政府对老挝局势“感到关切”，并且表示希望在最近将来将找到对付老挝局势的办法。
    据透露，同一天，两名美国大使馆官员在沙湾拿吉同富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛国集团共同策划了颠复富马政府的阴谋。
    据新华社24日讯　据美联社万象消息，老挝王国政府人士宣布，泰国驻老挝大使馆参赞仑·霍蓬21日晚上在同泰国接壤的老挝边境被捕，当时他身上带着重要的军事情报，其中包括万象防务的详细情况和可能进攻的建议。
    这是泰国乃沙立反动政府最近加紧策划武装干涉老挝的又一铁证。
