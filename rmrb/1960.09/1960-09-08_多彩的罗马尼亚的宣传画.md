	Propaganda posters are diverse. They can be inspiring battle songs for the people's progress, political essays for various struggles, or lyrical poems for propaganda work. The recent "Romanian Propaganda Posters and Pictures Exhibition" held in Beijing has taken us into a broad creative world with rich ideological content and novel and diverse artistic creations. The more than ninety works on display comprehensively represent the development of Romanian propaganda posters in recent years and the great achievements made by the artists in their creations. At the same time, it fully demonstrates the close and extensive connection between propaganda posters and the masses.
	As a weapon of political and ideological education, Romanian propaganda posters not only exert power in political struggles, but also have a profound and broad impact on people's economic and cultural life. On the one hand, the artists closely cooperate with various political movements in their creations. For example, works such as "We Will Enthusiastically Realize the Great Plan" (Nae Baflean), "We Build for Peace, for Socialism" (N. Constantin, B. Peter), "Our Era" (G. Iosif), "Bandung" (Tralko), "Dollar Diplomacy" (D. Cic), and "Imperialist 'Peace'" (G. Iosif), whether praising the prosperous and peaceful construction of the motherland, or praising the friendly unity of socialist countries and the people of the world, or exposing and attacking the imperialist war of aggression, all embody a clear Party spirit, and use vivid and powerful images to call on and encourage the masses to strive to complete current tasks and fight for a better tomorrow. On the other hand, the artists also do not relax in creating works related to the daily life of the masses, such as movie releases, theatrical performances, music competitions, exhibitions, and even propaganda posters for the rich products and beautiful scenic spots of the motherland. For example, the two works designed by Moise Iosif for the George Enescu International Music Competition were very successful. One depicts Enescu's head, cello, keyboard, sea, and white clouds; the other prominently uses the national flags of the participating countries to form a large musical note. The images in both paintings are cleverly arranged, and the colors are elegant and coordinated, filled with a strong poetic and musical atmosphere, which makes people's imagination run wild. Furthermore, the four propaganda posters designed by Vaflorica and G. Peter et al. for the Romanian folk art exhibition are also excellent works with novel style, decorative ingenuity, and folk colors. These paintings not only allow people to understand the content of the performance or exhibition, but also give people an aesthetic enjoyment, and posting them on the streets also has the effect of beautifying the city and improving the public's aesthetic interest.
	Many excellent works in the exhibition have such a power that they can immediately attract you and induce you to appreciate and understand them at a glance. This not only shows that the artists have a high artistic accomplishment, but also are proficient in the artistic language of propaganda posters. Although the themes, forms, and styles of the works are different, they all show the characteristics of refinement and generalization. The use of colors is less but does not feel monotonous, and is gorgeous without being vulgar, and can often form a specific mood according to the needs of the theme. The expressive techniques are diverse, such as contrast, symbolism, close-up, or setting, etc., all of which are used freely. For example, the expressive techniques of "Miner's Day" (G. Vencinţiu) and "New Address" (H. Nicolae, V. Radu) are completely different, one is clear at a glance, and the other has endless aftertastes, but both have achieved good results. The former uses a close-up technique to focus on portraying the firm image of miners in the new society. The composition is simple and powerful. The characters in the painting directly echo the audience outside the painting, which is exceptionally clear and eye-catching, making people believe that they will produce more coal for the motherland to welcome their holiday. The latter cleverly reflects the happy life of the Romanian people through the postman looking for a new address. The painting is full of a new atmosphere of construction. Truly, one building is completed and another is rising. Although the characters are not emphasized here, it is also very fascinating.
	This is the first time that Romanian propaganda posters have been introduced to our country in such a concentrated way, especially as we are celebrating the 16th anniversary of Romania's liberation, it is even more cordial to appreciate these wonderful works. I believe that through this exhibition, cultural exchanges between our two countries will be further promoted. (Attached picture)

    多彩的罗马尼亚的宣传画
    马克
    宣传画是多种多样的，它既可以是鼓舞人民前进的战歌，又可以是各种战斗的政论，也可以是宣传工作中抒情的诗篇。最近，在北京举行的《罗马尼亚宣传画、图片展览会》，就把我们带进到一个具有丰富思想内容和艺术创造新颖多样的广阔创作天地。展出的九十余幅作品，概括地表现了罗马尼亚宣传画近年发展的面貌和画家们在创作上取得的巨大成就，同时，也充分显示了宣传画和人民群众之间密切而又广泛的联系。
    罗马尼亚的宣传画，作为一种政治思想教育的武器，不仅在政治斗争中能发挥威力，而且在人民的经济和文化生活中，也有其深广的影响。画家们一方面紧密配合各项政治运动进行创作，例如《我们将热情地实现伟大的计划》（那·巴夫林）、《我们为和平、为社会主义建设》（尼·康司坦丁、贝·彼得）、《我们的时代》（郭·约瑟夫）、《万隆》（特拉尔郭）、《美元外交》（达·契克）、《帝国主义的‘和平’》（郭·约瑟夫）等作品，其内容不论是歌颂祖国欣欣向荣的和平建设事业，或是赞美社会主义国家和世界人民的友好团结，也不论是揭露和打击帝国主义的侵略战争，都体现着鲜明的党性，以生动有力的形象号召和鼓动群众努力完成当前的任务，并为更美好的明天而斗争。另一方面画家们也不放松创作和群众日常生活有关的作品，诸如电影上映、戏剧演出、音乐比赛会、展览会，以至于祖国富饶的物产和优美风景区的宣传画等等。例如摩·约瑟夫为伟大音乐家乔治·爱奈斯库国际音乐比赛会设计的两幅作品就很成功。一张描绘的是爱奈斯库的头像、大提琴、键盘、大海和白云；一张则突出地用参加比赛国家的国旗组成了一个大音符。两幅画的形象安排得都很巧，设色又很淡雅协调，充溢着浓郁的诗意和音境，看来令人浮想联翩。再如，瓦弗洛利卡和格·彼得等人为罗马尼亚民间艺术展览设计的四张宣传画，也是格调新颖、富有装饰匠意和民间色彩的佳作。这些画既能让人了解演出或展览的内容，又能使人得到一种美的享受，而且张贴街头还有美化城市和提高群众审美兴趣的作用。
    展出中的许多优秀作品，都具有这样一种力量，一着眼便能马上吸引你，诱使你去欣赏和了解它。这不仅说明画家们具有较高的艺术造诣，而且又谙练宣传画的艺术语言。作品的题材、形式和风格尽管各不相同，但都表现了洗炼和概括的特点。用色少而不觉单调，艳而不落俗套，常常能根据主题的需要构成特定的情调。表现手法多种多样，或对比或象征或特写或衬托等等，无不运用自如。举例来说，《矿工节》（格·文钦丘）和《新地址》（赫·尼古劳、维·拉杜）两幅画的表现手法就迥然不同，一个一目了然，一个有余不尽，但都收到了很好的效果。前者以特写的手法着重刻划了新社会矿工的坚定的形象，构图简洁有力，画中的人物直接和画外的观众相呼应，异常鲜明醒目，使人相信他们一定会为祖国增产更多的煤，来迎接自己的节日。后者通过送信的邮递员寻找新地址，巧妙地反映了罗马尼亚人民幸福的生活。画中充满着一片建设的新气象，真是一楼盖成一楼又起。这里虽没有着重表现人物，但也十分引人入胜。
    罗马尼亚的宣传画，还是第一次这样集中地介绍到我国来，尤其正当我们欢庆罗马尼亚解放十六周年的期间，能够欣赏这些精彩的作品更加感到亲切。相信通过这次展览，一定会更促进我们两国之间的文化交流。（附图片）
