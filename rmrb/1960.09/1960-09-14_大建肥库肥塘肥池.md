The people's communes in various counties of Nantong Special District, Jiangsu Province, are vigorously building water fertilizer reservoirs, grass mud ponds, and manure pools in the fields. They are collecting weeds, aquatic plants, and using crop stalks to compost fertilizer on the spot, preparing base fertilizer for autumn-sown crops such as wheat, rape, and broad beans. Currently, the entire special district has established more than 1.46 million water fertilizer reservoirs and grass mud ponds (an average of one for every six mu of land), and more than 146,000 field manure pools. Many reservoirs, ponds, and pools are already full of fertilizer.

Because Nantong Special District has a relatively large number of interplanted, relay planted, and multiple-cropped crops, agricultural work is particularly busy during the harvest and planting seasons. For example, during the autumn harvest and planting season, large quantities of grain, cotton, and special economic crops need to be harvested, the millions of mu of interplanted late autumn crops need to have their field management intensified, and winter crops such as wheat, rape, and broad beans need to be planted in a timely manner, so there is often a shortage of labor. In the past, large amounts of fertilizer could not be transported to the fields, and some autumn-sown crops had to be sown without any fertilizer. This year, in order to change this situation, Party organizations at all levels in the district, in accordance with the instructions of the district committee, have specifically studied local conditions, implemented the principles of short transportation distance, large fertilizer accumulation, low labor cost, and little or no land occupation, and carried out basic fertilizer construction in the fields to prepare base fertilizer for autumn-sown crops in advance. In the cotton-producing areas of Qidong, Haimen, Nantong, Rudong, and other coastal counties, small ditches and rivers are densely distributed in the fields, and there are a lot of aquatic plants in the water, so the conditions for accumulating fertilizer are very good. In addition, the by-products of crops and various weeds can be used to accumulate large quantities of high-quality water fertilizer. In these areas, the original small ditches and rivers are used, dams are built in the middle to build water fertilizer reservoirs, and aquatic plants and weeds are regularly collected and placed in the fertilizer reservoirs to compost water fertilizer for topdressing current autumn mature crops. When autumn planting comes, the fertilizer in the fertilizer reservoirs is taken out as base fertilizer, which has a higher fertilizer effect. In the main rice-growing areas of Hai'an Lixiahe, Nantong Shigang, and Rudong Tangyuan, ponds are dug in the fields, and aquatic plants, weeds, and fertile mud are used to compost grass pond mud as base fertilizer for autumn planting. In the sandy grain-producing areas of Rugao, Rudong, and Hai'an, water and grass are relatively scarce, so these areas build field manure pools and transport human and animal manure to the manure pools as early as possible. This eliminates the need for excessive labor to transport the fertilizer when it is applied.

    大建肥库肥塘肥池
    江苏南通专区各县人民公社，在田头大搞水肥库、草泥塘、大粪池，就地采集杂草、水草和使用农作物秸秆等沤制肥料，为麦子、油菜、蚕豆等秋播作物准备底肥。现在，全专区已建立水肥库和草泥塘一百四十六万多个（平均每六亩田一个），田头大粪池十四万六千多个。许多库、塘、池里已经积满了肥料。
    南通专区由于套种、间种、复种的作物比较多，每到收种季节，农活特别繁忙。例如秋收秋种期间，大批的粮食、棉花和特种经济作物要收上场，几百万亩套种的晚秋作物又要加紧田间管理，而麦子、油菜、蚕豆等越冬作物又要适时的抢种下去，因此常感劳动力不足，历年来有大批肥料无力运送下田，一部分秋播作物只好白田下种。今年，为了改变这种情况，全区各级党组织都根据地委指示，具体研究本地的条件，贯彻运距短、积肥多、花劳动力少、又不占或少占土地面积的原则，在田头进行肥料基本建设，为秋播作物提早准备底肥。在沿海启东、海门、南通、如东等县的产棉区，小沟小河密布田间，水里水草又特别多，积肥的条件很好，加上农作物的副产品和各种杂草，可以大量积优质水肥。在这些地方就利用原有的小沟小河，中段打坝筑水肥库，经常捞水草、铲杂草，放在肥库里沤制水肥，供当前秋熟作物追肥用，到秋种的时候，就把肥库里的肥料取上来作为基肥，肥效更高。在海安里下河、南通石港、如东汤元等主要水稻地区，即在田头挖塘，利用水草、杂草、肥泥沤制草塘泥，作为秋种的基肥。在如皋、如东、海安的沙质杂粮地区，水、草都比较少，这些地区即建筑田头粪池，把人畜粪及早运到粪池。这样施用的时候就不需要过多的劳动力去运。
