Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, 10th - African public opinion welcomes President Sékou Touré's visit to China. People hope to strengthen the friendship between China and Africa, China and Guinea in the struggle against the common enemy - imperialism.

    The Guinean News Agency published a commentary emphasizing the significance of President Touré's visit. The commentary said that this visit will strengthen the friendly and cooperative relations between the people of Guinea and the people of brotherly countries.

    Guinean Minister of National Education, Barry Diawandou, said: The Chinese people truly love peace, and the victories achieved by the Chinese people in the anti-imperialist struggle and in economic construction have greatly encouraged the Guinean people. He said: Touré's visit to China is a matter of great significance, because it is the first time that an African head of state has visited China, which has suffered exploitation and plunder like Africa for a long time. This visit is in the interests of both peoples.

    Kingué Abel, Vice-President of the Cameroon People's Union, said: All Africans believe that Sékou Touré's visit is a friendly visit. Such a visit would not have been possible if Guinea had not achieved true independence. China has shown with concrete actions that it is a true friend of Africans. He pointed out: The Great Wall built by the imperialists between China and Africa has been broken, thus enabling Asia and Africa to further strengthen friendly ties.

    Kagansa Hoji, the person in charge of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola, said: The Chinese people support the struggle of the African people because the Chinese people have been bullied by the same enemy and fought against this enemy.

    African figures here believe that only the joint action of the African and Chinese people can finally crush the actions taken by the collusion of the United States, Britain, France, Portugal, Belgium, and other imperialists. The imperialists' intention is to continue to cruelly and ruthlessly exploit the labor of colored people and plunder their resources.

    非洲舆论欢迎杜尔总统访华
    认为这次访问符合中几两国人民利益。希望加强中国和非洲人民在反对帝国主义斗争中的友谊
  新华社科纳克里10日电　非洲舆论欢迎塞古·杜尔访问中国之行。人们希望加强中国和非洲、中国和几内亚在反对共同敌人——帝国主义的斗争中的友谊。
    几内亚通讯社发表评论强调杜尔总统这次访问的意义。评论说，这次访问将是加强几内亚人民和兄弟的国家的人民之间的友好和合作关系。
    几内亚国民教育部长巴里·迪亚万杜说：中国人民的确热爱和平，中国人民在反帝斗争和在经济建设方面所取得的胜利，大大地鼓舞了几内亚人民。他说：杜尔访问中国是具有重大意义的事情，因为一个非洲国家元首访问曾经在长期间像非洲一样遭受剥削和掠夺的中国，这还是第一次。这次访问是符合两国人民的利益的。
    喀麦隆人民联盟副主席金格·阿贝尔说：全体非洲人都认为，塞古·杜尔的这次访问是一次友好的访问。如果几内亚没有获得真正的独立，这样的一次访问是不可能的。中国以具体的行动表明它是非洲人的真正的朋友。他指出：帝国主义者在中国和非洲之间筑起的长城已被突破，从而使亚、非两洲能进一步加强友好联系。
    安哥拉人民解放运动负责人卡甘萨·霍吉说：中国人民支持非洲各国人民的斗争，因为中国人民经受过同一个敌人的欺负，并同这个敌人作斗争。
    这里的非洲人士认为，只有非洲人民和中国人民的联合行动才能最后粉碎美、英、法、葡、比以及其他帝国主义者勾结起来采取的行动，帝国主义者的企图是继续残酷无情地剥削有色民族的劳动，掠夺他们的资源。
