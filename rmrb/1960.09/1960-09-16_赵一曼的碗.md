    Zhao Yiman's Bowl

    This coarse porcelain bowl is the rice bowl used by the anti-Japanese heroine Zhao Yiman when she was the political commissar of a regiment in the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army. Actually, Comrade Zhao Yiman only used this bowl once, but the old soldiers of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army could recognize that it was indeed the bowl used by Comrade Zhao Yiman. Because there is a touching story in it...

    After a battle to attack the Japanese invaders, a young communication orderly brought Comrade Zhao Yiman a bulging satchel. When opened, it turned out to be this coarse porcelain bowl. Because Comrade Zhao Yiman had already given a western-style enamel mug with a handle to a new soldier, the communication orderly had been wanting to get another bowl for Comrade Zhao Yiman, and only managed to get one in this battle. Comrade Zhao Yiman looked at the bowl and said:

    "Where did you get this? Please return it to where you got it!"

    "This... this... the devils have been wiped out, where can I return it to!"

    When it was time for the meal, the communication orderly filled the large bowl with sorghum rice for Comrade Zhao Yiman, thinking:

    "Now our political commissar should have a full meal."

    When Zhao Yiman saw this bowl of rice, she didn't know whether to criticize him or what to say. Obviously, it was brought from the infirmary. For many months, the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, fighting arduously against Japan, had been eating wild vegetables, digging up grass roots, and even grinding acorns into flour to fill their stomachs. Although they still had some grain that the villagers risked their lives to carry up from the mountains, it had to be reserved for the sick and wounded. The regiment commander, the political commissar, and the soldiers were all in the same situation, not having tasted grain for months. Looking at this bowl full of rice, she couldn't help but be moved by the heroic spirit and class love of the soldiers, and she couldn't criticize the young communication orderly; he was a strong little hero.

    When Comrade Zhao Yiman and others were not paying attention, she carried the bowl and gently walked into the cooking shed, poured the rice back into the pot, and personally scooped up half a bowl of wild vegetable porridge...

    Only the cook, Old Li, saw this. He didn't say a word, but his old eyes welled up with tears...

    The next day, when it was time for the meal, Comrade Zhao Yiman had no bowl again, making the young communication orderly shout:

    "My dear political commissar! A hundred bowls wouldn't be enough for you to 'lose' them like this!"

    Comrade Zhao Yiman smiled and whispered, "Not necessarily, a revolutionary rice bowl can never be lost!"

    According to later "investigation," this coarse porcelain bowl had already become the vegetable pot of the Seventh Platoon. (Xiaobai)

### 赵一曼的碗

    赵一曼的碗
    这一只粗瓷大碗，是抗联女英雄赵一曼同志在东北抗日联军担任团政治委员时用的饭碗。其实这个碗，赵一曼同志仅仅用过一次，但是抗联的老战士都能认出这确是赵一曼同志用过的碗。因为这里边有着一段感人的故事……
    在一次袭击日寇的战斗结束后，小通讯员提着个鼓鼓的挂包，给赵一曼同志送来，打开一看，原来是这只粗瓷大碗。因为赵一曼同志早就把一个有柄的洋瓷缸送给了新战士，通讯员一直想给赵一曼同志再弄一个碗，在这次战斗中才留心搞到一个。赵一曼同志看着这碗说：
    “哪里拿来的，请你还送还哪里去！”
    “这…这…鬼子都消灭了，这往哪送呀！”
    开饭时，通讯员用这大碗给赵一曼同志盛了满满一大碗高粱米饭，他心想：
  “这下子我们政委该吃顿饱饭了。”
    赵一曼看到这一碗饭，真不知道是批评他呢？还是说什么好，显然，这是从病号灶上盛来的。艰苦抗日的抗联部队，多少个月来，都是吃野菜、挖草根，甚至摘橡树子压成面来充饥。他们虽然手边还有些乡亲们冒着危险从山下背上来的粮食，但这得留给伤病员吃。团长、政委和战士一样，也是嘴边几个月没沾过粮食了。她再看看这满碗饭，不禁为英雄战士的艰苦精神和阶级友爱感动了，决不能批评小通讯员，他是个坚强的小英雄。
    赵一曼同志等人不防的时候，端着碗轻轻走进炊事栅，把饭又倒在锅里，自己亲手盛起半碗野菜粥……
    这些，只有炊事员老李看到了，他没有吭声，可是两只老眼涌满了泪花……
    第二天开饭时，赵一曼同志又没碗了，急得小通讯员直叫：
    “我说我的政委同志呀！给你一百个碗也架不住你这么‘丢’呀！”
    赵一曼同志笑着低声说：“可不见得，革命的饭碗一辈子也丢不了！”
    据后来“侦查”，这只粗瓷大饭碗早已成了七班的菜盆了。　（晓白）
