　　Capital Iron and Steel Front Reports Great Achievements
　　Monthly Completion or Over-Completion of State Plans, Daily Steel and Iron Production Reaches Highest Historical Levels

　　(Our Newspaper) This report says that the capital's iron and steel enterprises have achieved comprehensive and sustained leaps forward in production, with daily output of steel, pig iron, and steel materials reaching the highest levels in the city's history.

　　Since the beginning of this year, the capital's production of steel, pig iron, and steel materials has completed or exceeded the national plan every month. After overcoming high temperatures and the rainy season in July to seize high yields, a substantial and comprehensive increase began in August, and the situation has been even better since September. According to statistics from the responsible departments, in the first twenty-five days of September, the city's average daily output of steel, pig iron, and steel materials increased by 7.34%, 18.98%, and 15.43% respectively compared with the same period last month. The quality and variety of products have also improved and increased, respectively, and the consumption of pig iron and coke has decreased significantly. The pass rate of pig iron in the three small iron smelting plants in Shahe, Miyun, and Yanqing has increased by about one time by mid-September compared with August. The utilization coefficient of blast furnaces, converters, and electric furnaces in the city has also greatly improved. The utilization coefficients of the blast furnaces and converters of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company and the electric furnaces of the Beijing Steel Plant reached the advanced national level in August. September saw a greater increase than August.

　　In late July, the capital's iron and steel enterprises widely mobilized the masses to carry out great airing of views, great debates, and in-depth inspections of the first seven months of production, discussing further leap forward targets. Since September, they have launched a vigorous and solid campaign to increase production and practice economy. A large number of leading cadres have gone deep into the grassroots, focusing on the key and weak links of production, grasping key furnaces and teams, following shifts to work, and cultivating "experimental plots." The vast number of management cadres have also gone deep into the teams and linked up with relevant worker administrators to work together and solve problems on the spot. More than 1,200 cadres from various enterprises have been approved to work as workers in workshops or as grassroots leaders. Some veteran technical workers who had been removed from production have also returned to their production posts, greatly enriching the strength of the production front line.

　　After the cadres went deep into the grassroots, they focused on strengthening group work in three aspects: strengthening the political and ideological work of the group, mobilizing the masses to discuss group plans, and participating in management. Party member leading cadres of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, Beijing Steel Plant, Xuanwu Steel Plant, and other units have generally strengthened the leadership of grassroots Party groups to strengthen the political and ideological work of the group, improved organizational life, and mobilized Party members to do ideological work, giving full play to the role of the Party group as a fighting fortress. At the same time, the work of the Communist Youth League group and the trade union group, which serve as assistants to the group, has also been strengthened.

　　With the in-depth development of the group's political and ideological work, the vast majority of groups in the city's iron and steel enterprises have discussed and formulated group plans and guarantee measures based on the overall production tasks of the entire factory and workshop. These plans not only include indicators for output, quality, variety, material consumption, and safety, but also have specific requirements for each month, week, day, and shift. According to the group plan, each person has also formulated a personal action plan and guarantee measures. This ensures that everyone is clear about their responsibilities, individuals guarantee the group, groups guarantee the work section, work sections guarantee the workshop, and workshops guarantee the entire factory, so that the plan is implemented at all levels. The steelmaking workers of Class B of the No. 4 electric furnace of the Beijing Steel Plant carefully analyzed the characteristics of various steels and set indicators for shortening the smelting time of various steels, such as how many minutes each steel smelting takes for the melting period, oxidation period, and reduction period, and stipulated that each steel smelting should be checked once to create conditions for smelting the second steel. In order to ensure that the smelting time of each steel is implemented, each worker has formulated a personal guarantee plan. As a result, this class has achieved high yields in every furnace since September.

　　Through the formulation of leap forward plans, the production enthusiasm of the masses has been further heightened. Many units have taken advantage of the situation to establish and improve various production managers within the production group, who are workers. Worker managers are divided according to professional division of labor to assist the production team leader in managing the various indicators of the production increase and cost reduction plan. After the workers' election, the production groups of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company have established more than 13,000 worker management personnel for technology, equipment, safety, competition, cost accounting, quality, labor organization, education, and welfare. They are conscientious, responsible, and enthusiastic in their work. Technical administrators organize group workers to vigorously tackle various key production technologies, promote advanced experience, and formulate production increase measures; equipment administrators strengthen equipment maintenance management; competition members learn about the production situation of their own group and brother groups in each shift, organize competitions and evaluations between shifts and people, and education members organize everyone to read newspapers every day. In this way, the management work of the entire enterprise has been greatly strengthened.

　　After the group work was strengthened, in order to realize their leap forward targets, the workers quickly launched a red flag competition movement to catch up with each other, many key production points were quickly broken through, and a large number of advanced collectives, individuals, and new production records emerged.

　　The vigorous competition has enabled the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to develop more deeply, and many advanced experiences have been rapidly applied to production. The vast majority of blast furnaces in the city have widely adopted new technologies in increasing air volume and increasing furnace temperature, which has played an important role in increasing pig iron production and ensuring pig iron quality. The Beijing Steel Plant and the Beijing Special Steel Plant vigorously adopted new technologies to vigorously attack the desulfurization of iron-making furnaces, which rapidly increased the desulfurization rate by 25%, ensuring the supply of molten iron and the improvement of steel ingot quality.

　　In order to greet the great National Day with more outstanding achievements, and to achieve high production before the festival and a "good start" after the festival, the workers on the Beijing Iron and Steel front are making persistent efforts to further carry out the red flag competition movement, continue to vigorously adopt new technologies, attack key production points, actively manufacture spare parts, strengthen equipment maintenance and repair, and do a good job in raw material reserves and in-plant transportation, and strive to comprehensively complete and over-fulfill the annual production plan.

    首都钢铁战线喜报大面积丰收
　　月月完成或超额完成国家计划，钢、铁日产量达到历史上最高水平
    本报讯　首都各钢铁企业生产全面持续跃进，钢、生铁、钢材的日产量都达到了全市历史上的最高水平。
    今年以来，首都的钢、生铁和钢材的生产都月月完成或超额完成了国家计划。7月份战胜高温雨季夺得高产以后，8月份开始大幅度全面增长，进入9月以后形势更好。据主管部门统计，9月前二十五天，全市钢、生铁和钢材的平均日产量，分别比上月同期提高了7.34％、18.98％和15.43％，产品的质量、品种也都分别有了提高和增加，生铁、焦炭的消耗有了显著下降。沙河、密云、延庆等三个小型炼铁厂的生铁合格率，截至9月中旬，都比8月份提高一倍左右。全市高炉、转炉、电炉的利用系数也有很大提高。石景山钢铁公司的高炉、转炉和北京钢厂的电炉的利用系数，在8月份都达到了全国的先进水平。9月份比8月份又有很大提高。
    首都各钢铁企业，在7月下旬广泛发动群众开展了大鸣大放大辩论，深入检查了前七个月的生产，讨论了进一步跃进的指标，9月以来又开展了轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实的增产节约运动，大批领导干部纷纷深入基层，针对生产关键和薄弱环节，抓住重点炉子和班组，跟班劳动，种“试验田”；广大的管理干部也深入班组和各有关工人管理员挂钩，共同进行工作，现场解决问题；各企业共有一千二百多名干部被批准到车间当工人或做基层领导工作。一些脱产的老技术工人，也返回生产岗位，大大充实了生产第一线的力量。
    干部们深入基层以后，从加强小组政治思想工作、发动群众讨论小组计划和参加管理等三个方面，狠狠地抓小组工作。石景山钢铁公司、北京钢厂、宣武钢厂等单位的党员领导干部，为了加强小组的政治思想工作，普遍加强了对基层党小组的领导，健全了组织生活，并且发动党员人人做思想工作，充分发挥党小组的战斗堡垒作用。与此同时，也加强了作为小组助手的共青团小组和工会小组的工作。
    随着小组政治思想工作的深入开展，全市各钢铁企业的绝大多数小组，都根据全厂和车间总的生产任务，讨论制订了小组计划和保证措施。这些计划不但有产量、质量、品种、材料消耗、安全等指标，而且有每月、每周、每天和每班的具体要求。根据小组计划，每个人又制订了个人的行动计划和保证措施。做到了人人心中有数，个人保小组，小组保工段，工段保车间，车间保全厂，使计划层层落了实。北京钢厂四号电炉乙班的炼钢工人，认真分析了各种钢的特性，对缩短各种钢的冶炼时间，每炼一炉钢的熔化期、氧化期、还原期各用多少分钟等，都订出了指标，并规定每炼一炉钢就作一次检查，为炼第二炉钢创造条件。为了保证使每炉钢的冶炼时间落实，每个工人都订出了个人保证计划，结果，这个班9月以来，炉炉高产。
    通过制订跃进计划，群众的生产热情更加高涨。很多单位就因势利导，在生产小组内普遍建立和健全了由工人担任的各种生产管理员。工人管理员按专业分工，协助生产组长把增产节约计划的各项指标管理起来。石景山钢铁公司各生产小组，经过工人选举，已建立起技术、设备、安全、竞赛、成本核算、质量、劳动组织、教育、生活福利等各种工人管理人员一万三千多人，他们认真负责，积极热情地进行工作。技术管理员组织小组工人猛攻各个生产技术关键，推广先进经验，制订增产措施；设备管理员加强设备维修管理；竞赛员班班了解本组和兄弟组的生产情况，组织班与班、人与人的竞赛和评比，教育员每天组织大家读报。这样，使得整个企业的管理工作大大加强。
    小组工作加强以后，工人们为了实现自己的跃进指标，迅速开展起你追我赶的红旗竞赛运动，很多生产关键被迅速突破，先进的集体、个人和生产新纪录大量涌现。
    轰轰烈烈的竞赛，使技术革新和技术革命运动得到更加深入的发展，许多先进经验迅速在生产上得到应用。全市绝大多数高炉在加大风量、提高炉温等方面，普遍采用了新技术，对增加生铁产量和保证生铁质量起了重要的作用。北京钢厂、北京特殊钢厂用大力采用新技术猛攻化铁炉脱硫关，使脱硫率迅速提高25％，保证了铁水供给和钢锭质量的提高。
    为了用更加出色的成绩迎接伟大的国庆节，做到节前创高产，节后“开门红”，北京钢铁战线上的职工，正再接再厉，进一步开展红旗竞赛运动，继续大力采用新技术，攻打生产关键，积极制造备品备件，加强设备维护检修，做好原材料储备和厂内运输等工作，为全面完成和超额完成全年的生产计划而奋斗。
