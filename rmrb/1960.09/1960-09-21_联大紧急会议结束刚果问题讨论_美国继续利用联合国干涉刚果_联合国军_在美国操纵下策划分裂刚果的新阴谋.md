Xinhua News Agency, 20th dispatch from New York: The United Nations Emergency General Assembly, which discussed the Congo situation, continued its meeting on the 19th and ended the discussion on this issue in the early morning of today, New York time. The meeting passed a joint proposal submitted by seventeen African and Asian nations (Ethiopia later joined as a co-sponsor), led by Ghana, with a majority vote.

The proposal was adopted by a vote of seventy to zero, with eleven abstentions. The socialist countries, including the Soviet Union, as well as France and South Africa, abstained. Western countries, including the United States and Britain, actively supported the seventeen-nation proposal.

The proposal stipulates that the General Assembly authorizes and supports Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, who is opposing the Congolese central government on behalf of the Congolese rebels, to continue to "take vigorous actions to assist" the Congolese government "in restoring and maintaining law and order," requiring all United Nations member states to "provide funds" for the United Nations' activities in the Congo, and not to provide direct or indirect military assistance to the Congolese government during the United Nations' "assistance" to the Congo.

Albanian representative Mali Lie stated at the meeting that behind this convened UN Emergency General Assembly lies a new conspiracy by imperialism against the young Republic of the Congo. He believes that the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, which will be convened on the 20th, should seriously study the Congo issue proposed by the Soviet Union for inclusion on the agenda.

Gryaznov, representative of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, pointed out that the United States is trying every possible means to obstruct the 15th session of the General Assembly from conducting a broad discussion on the Congo situation. At the same time, with the direct support of the United States and its partners, the "UN forces" are encouraging conspiracies against the legitimate government of the Congo. They disarmed Congolese troops loyal to the central government.

After the General Assembly voted on the seventeen-nation African and Asian proposal, Soviet representative Zorin made a brief speech, pointing out that the Congo issue will be discussed again at the 15th session of the General Assembly convened today.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th dispatch from Leopoldville: The United Nations, which serves the sinister plot of the United States to swallow the Congo, announced on the 19th that it had established a so-called "neutral zone" thirty kilometers wide in the territory of Katanga Province along the border of Kivu Province in the Republic of the Congo, and that it would be controlled by "UN forces."

Sources say that the United Nations also wants to establish a "neutral zone" of the same width within Kivu Province.

As everyone knows, the vanguard of the Congolese government forces, who are campaigning against the secessionist group of the imperialist stooge Tshombe, has advanced 42 kilometers into Katanga Province from Kivu Province and is continuing to advance. At the same time, a large number of Congolese government troops are still gathering at the junction of Kivu Province and Katanga Province. Obviously, the purpose of the United Nations in establishing this so-called "neutral zone" is to relieve the siege of the collapsing Tshombe group and hinder the legitimate desire of the Congolese government to achieve the unification of the Congo.

As previously reported, when the Congolese government forces entered Katanga Province, the United Nations brazenly sent "UN forces" to obstruct them.

A United Nations spokesman in the Congo also declared on the 19th that if necessary, "UN Headquarters" could also establish similar "neutral zones" between Kasai Province and Katanga Province. Currently, the reactionary troops of the Kalonji rebel group are still stubbornly resisting the Congolese government forces in Kasai Province. And the conspiracy of "UN Headquarters" is to plan a "ceasefire" and to have the government forces withdraw to Luluabourg, the capital of Kasai Province.

　　联大紧急会议结束刚果问题讨论
　  美国继续利用联合国干涉刚果
    “联合国军”在美国操纵下策划分裂刚果的新阴谋
    新华社20日讯　纽约消息：讨论刚果局势的联合国紧急大会19日继续开会，到纽约时间今天清晨结束了关于这一问题的讨论。会议以多数票通过了由加纳领衔提出的亚非十七国（埃塞俄比亚后来加入发起国）联合提案。
    这项提案是以七十票对零票，十一票弃权获得通过的。弃权的是苏联等社会主义国家以及法国和南非。美国、英国等西方国家积极支持十七国提案。
    这项提案规定由大会授权，支持刚果叛乱分子反对刚果中央政府的哈马舍尔德继续“采取有力的行动协助”刚果政府“恢复和维持法律和秩序”，要求所有联合国成员国为联合国在刚果的活动“提供款项”，并且不要在联合国“援助”刚果期间直接或间接向刚果政府提供军事援助。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表马利列在会议上发言指出，在这次召开的联大紧急会议后面，隐藏着帝国主义反对年青的刚果共和国的新阴谋。他认为在20日召开的联合国大会第十五届会议应当认真研究苏联倡议列入议程的刚果问题。
    白俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国代表格里亚兹诺夫指出，美国千方百计地企图阻挠联大第十五届会议就刚果局势问题进行广泛的讨论。与此同时，在美国和它的伙伴的直接支持下，“联合国军”正在鼓励反对刚果合法政府的阴谋。他们解除了忠于中央政府的刚果军队的武装。
    在大会就亚非十七国提案表决以后，苏联代表佐林发表简单讲话，他指出，在今天召开的联大第十五届会议上将再次讨论刚果问题。
    新华社20日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：为美国鲸吞刚果的罪恶阴谋服务的联合国，19日竟宣布它已在刚果共和国沿基伍省边境的加丹加省境内建立了一个三十公里宽的所谓“中立区”，并将由“联合国军”来加以控制。
    有消息说，联合国还要在基伍省境内建立同样宽的一个“中立区”。
    人所共知，讨伐帝国主义走狗冲伯分裂集团的刚果政府军先头部队已从基伍省推进到加丹加省境内四十二公里远的地方，并在继续向前挺进。同时，大量的刚果政府军还在基伍省和加丹加省交界处集结。显然，联合国建立这个所谓“中立区”的目的，是为了给正在溃败中的冲伯集团解围，阻挠刚果政府军实现统一刚果的正当愿望。
    前已报道，在刚果政府军攻进加丹加省时，联合国就曾悍然派出“联合国军”前往阻挠。
    在刚果的联合国发言人19日还宣称，如果需要的话，“联合国总部”也可以在开赛省和加丹加省之间建立同样的“中立区”。目前，卡隆吉叛乱集团的反动军队仍在开赛省顽抗刚果政府军。而“联合国总部”的阴谋是策划“停火”，并要政府军撤回开赛省会路路阿堡去。
