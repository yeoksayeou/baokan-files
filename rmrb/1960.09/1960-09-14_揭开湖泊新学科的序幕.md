Unveiling the Prelude to a New Discipline of Lakes	Yang Xichen, Nanjing Institute of Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences

China is a country with extremely abundant lake resources. Whether along the fertile banks of the Yangtze River or on the snow-capped Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, there are lake groups distributed. The types of lakes in our country are very complex (such as glacial lakes, lagoons, karst lakes, tectonic lakes, etc.), and the resource reserves are extremely rich. Among them are many world-famous large lakes: such as Qinghai Lake, Dongting Lake, Poyang Lake, Taihu Lake, Jingpo Lake, Lop Nur, etc. According to incomplete statistics, the area of natural lakes in the country is more than 50,000 square kilometers, and the total area of lake depressions in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (Yichang to Datong) is about 20,000 square kilometers, accounting for about 10% of the area of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Plain. Since liberation, artificial lakes (reservoirs) have been built one after another. Especially since the national water conservancy movement, the number of reservoirs has increased rapidly.官厅 (Guanting), 佛子岭 (Foziling), 新安江 (Xin'anjiang), 三门峡 (Sanmenxia) and 丹江口 (Danjiangkou) are all large reservoirs in our country at present.

	The Role of Lake Resources in the National Economy

Lake resources play a significant role in the national economy. Lakes can provide farmland irrigation, industrial and drinking water sources, be used as transportation waterways, develop aquaculture, and regulate river runoff. Salt lakes in plateau areas contain large amounts of minerals and are important raw material bases for national defense industry, chemical industry, and salt-making industry. Some lakes also have abundant hydropower resources for power generation. It should be pointed out that the shores of lakes are often places with beautiful scenery. Utilizing the natural environment of lakes and opening up lakeside parks can provide laborers with sanatoriums and holiday recreation.

Taking flood regulation and aquatic products as examples, the economic benefits of lakes can be clearly seen. In 1954, the Yangtze River encountered an extraordinary flood, with a peak flow of 68,000 cubic meters per second, while the safe flood discharge of the middle reaches of the river was only 45,000 cubic meters per second. In the Jianli area, the river course is curved and the gradient is gentle, and the safe discharge capacity is only 35,000 cubic meters per second, accounting for only half of the flood of the Yangtze River main stream. It was precisely because of the flood storage function of the lake group depressions along the river and the consolidated dike measures that the Jianghan Plain and Wuhan area were guaranteed to be free from disasters, making beneficial contributions to the cause of socialist construction. Aquatic resources of lakes occupy a very important position. According to preliminary statistics, the annual output of fish in Taihu Lake alone reaches about 200,000 dan. If all the large and small lakes in the country are fully utilized, the total output of aquatic products will be even more considerable.

We cannot fail to see that the current degree of lake utilization is still very low, far behind the needs of the leap-forward development of production. At present, many lakes are still in the natural utilization stage. Even in lakes with high water production like Taihu Lake, the average yield per mu is only five to six jin. Due to the comprehensive effect of natural factors on lakes, some lakes are gradually declining, and with the passage of time, their ability to regulate river runoff will also gradually decrease. For example, the well-known Dongting Lake has retreated from the largest freshwater lake in the country to the second largest, and drought and flood disasters are still quite serious in many lake areas. "A vast expanse of water during floods, a single line of water during droughts," this is a true reflection of the water level changes in Poyang Lake. Although the situation of reservoirs is somewhat different, after reservoir impoundment, important issues such as reservoir bank evolution, reservoir siltation, water temperature changes, water surface evaporation loss, water quality salinization, and waves all urgently need to be studied. The task facing lake science is how to comprehensively transform the natural conditions of lakes and reservoirs, master the laws of various changes and developments, and fully exploit the production potential of lakes to better serve the national economy.

      Lake Science Must Follow the Direction of Comprehensive Research

The earliest researcher of lakes was Professor Forel of Switzerland. "Studies of Lake Geneva" is a typical masterpiece on lakes written based on his more than 30 years of experience. In the 19th century, Russia, Switzerland, and Germany had already begun systematic lake research. At the beginning of the 20th century, the lake research norms compiled by the Russian scholar Marllov were already published. Academician Berg's paper on the Aral Sea is a famous work in lake science research. And Professor Zaikov's "Introduction to Limnology" has described lake science very perfectly at the latest modern scientific level. In addition, the United States and Japan also have many works on lakes.

The content of Western limnology focuses on lake biology. Although there are more in-depth studies on individual problems in lakes, such as the problem of calculating the light and heat refraction of lake water by German scholars, it is not comprehensive in general. Their research space is mostly limited to the lakes themselves. Soviet limnology, however, pays attention to all aspects related to lakes. They regard lakes as part of a natural complex, studying the formation and evolution of lakes themselves and the relationship between them and the climate of the lake area and the natural conditions of the lake shore, especially research combined with production for transforming nature. The achievements of Soviet lake research far exceed those of all capitalist countries.

      Lake science is still a new discipline in our country. The development of limnology in our country should undoubtedly follow the socialist road, based on the needs of production and the requirements of national economic development. From the perspective of the multifaceted role of lakes, they must be regarded as unified comprehensive research objects. Single-objective research on the development and utilization of lakes violates the principles of socialist construction. The generation and changes of various complex phenomena and processes in lakes cannot be fully understood and explained by a single discipline. There is a close relationship of mutual influence and interdependence between the various phenomena and processes unified in the natural conditions of lakes. For example, the changes in the color and transparency of lake water are affected by the soil quality of the lake basin and plankton. To study the hydrological characteristics of lakes, the climate of the lake area, the natural geography of the lake shore, and even physics (optics, acoustics, thermodynamics), etc., become indispensable factors for understanding lake hydrological phenomena and processes. To study lake aquatic organisms, mainly to study the habitat of animals, plants and biological communities in lake water, then it must draw the information it needs from hydrology (including hydrochemistry) to a considerable extent. Through the aquatic organisms themselves, animal, plant, and organic matter distribution data, we can indirectly understand hydrological characteristics, such as lake flow distribution, water exchange between different lake areas, chemical action changes at different depths, and so on. In addition, when we study lakes, if we do not consider the nature of the lake basin, it is difficult to imagine all the lake phenomena, because the conditions of the size, shape, formation, evolution, and structural characteristics of the lake shore largely determine many characteristics of lake hydrology, biology, and chemistry. From the above simple analysis, it is not difficult to see the comprehensive characteristics of lake research.

It should be emphasized that studying lake characteristics requires simultaneously studying lake hydrology, geology, geomorphology, hydrochemistry, and aquatic biology, but limnology is not a simple combination of the above disciplines, but an independent comprehensive science.

According to the principle of the unity of natural phenomena in lakes, research on lakes can be roughly divided into two aspects:

      (1) Focusing on lake water bodies, study hydrological, biological, chemical, and physical phenomena and processes occurring in lake water.

      (2) Using the morphology of the lake basin as the object, study the natural environment of the lake water body, understand the causes, development, evolution, and mutual relationship with the water body.

Through these two aspects of research, we can obtain a complete concept of lake science and provide a comprehensive scientific basis for the transformation and comprehensive utilization of lake resources. Otherwise, lake science will not have research content if it leaves the water body, and if the study of the water body ignores its natural environment, it will lose its basic conditions for survival. The objective situation determines that lake science research must follow a comprehensive direction.

It should be pointed out that comprehensive lake research not only does not exclude the development of independent disciplines, but can only play a positive role in promoting their development. The principle of comprehensive research is by no means to disregard time, place and conditions, and mechanically list all research contents in parallel, but to determine research tasks according to the specific characteristics of lake distribution, with the purpose of serving production needs, and should focus on a certain most prominent production problem, with a certain discipline as the center for comprehensive research. For lakes along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the most urgent need may be to solve the problem of expanding the development and utilization of aquatic resources. Investigation and research in this area should focus on lake aquatic biology, and other work should revolve around this center to provide the information it needs, while taking into account other aspects of the lake, such as shipping, water supply irrigation, and lacustrine mineral deposits. As the region changes, the central task of scientific research will inevitably change accordingly. For lakes in plateau or arid areas, the main research content may be to explore mineral deposits, serve the chemical industry, find water sources, and change the climate; but it does not exclude research on other production problems. Lakes, like other natural resources, must adhere to the policy of comprehensive development and comprehensive utilization.
A combination of lake resource surveys, research station observations, and indoor experiments

To understand nature and transform nature, there must be complete scientific methods. For the various phenomena and processes occurring in lakes, it is required to grasp the laws of their changes and development, and to base the actual lake production problems to be solved on long-term, systematic, and comprehensive scientific data. Lake research work should not only adopt mobile short-term comprehensive surveys of lake resources and systematic observations at fixed field lake research stations, but also conduct indoor experiments to verify each other with field surveys and observations. Through the close combination of these three methods, it is possible to draw more correct conclusions for solving research topics with significant production value and scientific significance.

A comprehensive survey of lake resources is a temporary lake survey. Although lake science in our country is still in its initial stage, many national economic departments have already made demands on lake science. Therefore, organizing a comprehensive survey of lake resources first is an important way to serve the needs of the national economy, and it is also the best step for the rapid development of lake science.

The content of a comprehensive survey of lake resources should generally include the following aspects: lake hydrology, lake geology and geomorphology, natural geography of the lake shore, lake aquatic biology, hydrochemical characteristics of lakes, and economic surveys of lakes, etc.; and study the morphology of the lake basin and its formation and evolution laws, discover lacustrine mineral deposits, understand the storage and distribution of aquatic resources, the content and changes of lake water chemical composition, master lake hydrological characteristics, lake water regulation, lake water movement, investigate the current status of lake utilization, etc. Many actual topics with significant production value that need in-depth discussion in scientific research are put forward from comprehensive resource surveys.

The comprehensive survey of lake resources should be carried out as quickly as possible. As mentioned above, there are not only many lakes in our country, but also a wide distribution. If we rely solely on a small number of professional institutions to undertake this task, it will inevitably develop slowly. Lake science research, like other socialist construction undertakings, should also launch a large-scale mass movement and give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses and their infinite wisdom. Because the people living by the lake have a close relationship with the lake in their economic life, they deeply understand it and are familiar with it. The broad masses of the Poyang Lake area have mastered the characteristics of lake water level changes based on the rich experience of long-term life. Under the leadership of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, a large-scale movement to compete with the lake for land and advance towards the lake beach is currently underway. In addition, the people living by the lake have also accumulated extremely valuable experience in wind and wave forecasting, aquaculture, and fishing. It is firmly believed that by relying on the masses and learning from the masses, lake research work can definitely achieve better results. Scientific research units and relevant economic departments should assume the responsibility of technical consultants, select typical lakes in several different regions, conduct in-depth investigations and research with an experimental nature, explore a set of methods, and formulate relatively complete survey technical specifications that meet the actual situation, introduce and promote them, as technical guidance in the overall survey work.

Observation at fixed lake research stations refers to long-term observation and research work, which is the most important aspect of lake research work. It is an inseparable link with the comprehensive survey of lake resources, and it can also be said to be a combination of "points and surfaces". The objects selected by fixed research stations should be the establishment of comprehensive experimental research bases based on various types of large lakes in different regions of our country. The main research content of experimental stations is water balance, sediment balance, heat balance, chemical balance, and wave and lake flow conditions, lake climate regulation, aquatic biological ecological conditions, living habits, etc., and to theoretically explore the laws of change of various elements.

      Experimental research is an indispensable component of scientific work. Field observations often require a long time to find patterns, and in order to study the relationship between various natural factors and their influencing conditions, it is also necessary to supplement them with indoor experiments. For example, in the study of lake (reservoir) bank deformation, the formation and development of wind waves, model experiments can obtain results more quickly. The mutual verification of experimental data and observation data will help improve the quality of research, solve production problems, and make the arguments sufficient. Therefore, lake science should follow the principle of equal emphasis on qualitative and quantitative analysis, a combination of short-term surveys, long-term observations, and indoor experiments, so that theory truly has the universal significance of guiding production practice.

Because lake conditions and reservoir conditions have great similarities, the purpose of studying lakes is not only to effectively comprehensively utilize lakes, but also has important guiding significance for the operation of existing reservoirs and the design of proposed reservoirs. It is expected that in the next few years, carrying out research on reservoirs will become the most important part of lake science in our country.

At present, comprehensive surveys of lake resources have been carried out in some areas. For example, the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has investigated the aquatic biology of hundreds of large and small lakes. The Nanjing Institute of Geography of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has not only conducted a comprehensive survey of Jiangsu lakes, but also is preparing to build a comprehensive lake experimental station in Jiangsu. The Qinghai-Gansu Comprehensive Expedition Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has conducted a large number of investigations and research on salt lakes in the Qaidam Basin. In addition, relevant industrial departments, universities and local relevant units are also actively organizing and carrying out this work. Although the scale of lake investigation and research work is not large enough at present, experience is still very lacking, and the quality is not very high, we firmly believe that under the correct leadership and care of the Party, this new discipline of lake science will continue to develop with the leap-forward situation of rapid progress, with the growth and expansion of the scientific research team, and will quickly catch up with the advanced world level.

    揭开湖泊新学科的序幕	中国科学院南京地理研究所　杨锡臣
    我国是一个湖泊资源十分丰富的国家。无论在沃野千里的长江沿岸或是积雪终年的青、康、藏高原，都有湖群的分布。我国湖泊的类型十分复杂（如冰蚀湖、泻湖、喀斯特湖、构造湖等），资源蕴藏极为丰富。其中有许多闻名于世的大湖：如青海湖、洞庭湖、鄱阳湖、太湖、镜泊湖、罗布泊等。据不完全统计，全国天然湖泊面积在五万平方公里以上，而长江中、下游（宜昌至大通）湖泊洼地总面积即有二万余平方公里左右，几占长江中、下游平原区面积的10％左右。解放后，人工湖泊（水库）陆续兴建，特别是自全国水利化运动以来，水库数量迅速增加，像官厅、佛子岭、新安江、三门峡以及丹江口等都是我国目前的大型水库。
        湖泊资源在国民经济中的作用
    湖泊资源在国民经济中有着重大的作用。湖泊既可以提供农田灌溉、工业和饮用水源，用作交通航道，又可以发展水产养殖事业，调节河川径流。高原地带的盐湖，蕴藏大量矿产，更是国防工业、化学工业和制盐工业重要的原料基地。某些湖泊还具有丰富的水力资源，可供发电。应该指出，滨湖沿岸，常常又是山水秀丽，风景优美的地方，利用湖泊的自然环境，开辟湖滨公园，可供劳动人民疗养和假日游憩。
    以调节洪水和水产为例，就可以清楚地看出湖泊的经济效益。1954年长江遭遇特大洪水，其洪峰流量为六万八千秒公方，而中游河道的安全泄洪量只有四万五千秒公方。监利一带，河道弯曲，坡降平缓，安全泄量仅三万五千秒公方，只占长江干流洪水的一半。正是由于沿江湖群洼地的蓄洪作用，以及巩固的堤防措施，才保证了江汉平原和武汉地区免于灾害，对社会主义建设事业作出了有益的贡献。湖泊的水产资源占着十分重要的地位，据初步统计，仅太湖鱼的年产量即达二十万担左右，如果把全国大小湖泊充分利用起来，水产品的总产量更是十分可观。
    我们不能不看到，目前湖泊利用的程度还很低，远远落后于生产飞跃发展的需要。目前许多湖泊仍然处于天然利用阶段，即使像太湖这样水产量很高的湖泊，平均亩产亦不过五到六斤。由于湖泊受自然因素综合作用的影响，某些湖泊日趋衰亡，随着时间的增长，其调节河川径流的能力亦将日渐减小。如众所熟知的洞庭湖，已由全国第一大淡水湖而退居第二，许多湖区，旱涝灾害仍相当严重。“大水一片，枯水一线”，这就是鄱阳湖水位变化的真实写照。水库的情况虽有所不同，但水库蓄水以后，库岸演变、水库泥沙淤积、水温变化、水面蒸发耗损、水质盐化和波浪等重要问题，都亟待进行研究。摆在湖泊科学面前的任务是如何全面地改造湖泊水库的自然条件，掌握各种变化发展规律，充分发挥湖泊的生产潜力，更好地为国民经济服务。
      湖泊科学必须遵循综合研究的方向
    研究湖泊最早的是瑞士学者弗列尔教授。《日内瓦湖泊的研究》一书，是他积累了三十多年经验写成的湖泊典型巨著。十九世纪，俄国、瑞士、德国就已开始了系统的湖泊研究工作。二十世纪初俄国学者马尔洛夫所编写的湖泊研究规范即已问世。贝尔格院士关于咸海的论文，是湖泊科学研究的名著。而扎依可夫教授所著《湖泊学概论》，已用现代最新科学水平极完善地叙述湖泊科学。此外美国、日本也有不少湖泊方面的论著。
    西方湖泊学的内容，偏重于湖泊生物，对湖泊中的个别问题虽有较深入的研究，如德国学者曾研究过湖水光热折射计算问题，但总的来看是不全面的。他们研究的空间，多限于湖泊本身。苏联的湖泊学却注意到与湖泊有关的诸方面。他们将湖泊视为自然综合体的一部分，研究湖泊本身的形成、演变以及与湖区气候、滨湖自然条件之间的相互关系，特别是结合生产，为改造自然而进行的研究，苏联湖泊研究的成就远远超过了一切资本主义国家。
      湖泊科学在我国还是一门新学科。我国湖泊学的发展，无疑地应该沿着社会主义道路，以生产需要和国民经济发展要求为依据。从湖泊多方面的作用来看，必须把它作为统一的综合研究对象，单目标研究湖泊的开发利用，是违背社会主义建设原则的。湖泊中各种复杂的现象和过程的产生与变化，绝非某一门学科所能全面认识和解释的。统一在湖泊自然条件中的各种现象和过程之间，有着相互影响，彼此依存的密切关系。例如湖泊水色和透明度的变化，就受湖盆土质，浮游生物的影响。要研究湖泊水文特性，湖区气候，滨湖自然地理，甚至物理学（光、声、热学），等等，就成为认识湖泊水文现象和过程不可忽视的因素。要研究湖泊水生物，主要是研究湖水中动、植物和生物群的栖居问题，那么，它就不得不在颇大程度上从水文学中（包括水化学）吸取它需要的资料。而通过水生生物本身，动、植物，有机物分布资料，又可以间接了解水文特性，如湖流分布、各个不同湖区之间的水交换，不同深度化学作用变化过程等等。另外，当我们研究湖泊时，如果不考虑湖盆的性质，那么就很难想像所有的湖泊现象，因为湖盆大小、形状、成因、变迁，湖岸结构特点等条件，在很大的程度上决定着湖泊水文、生物、化学的许多特性。从上述简单分析中，不难看出湖泊研究工作所具有的综合性特点。
    应该强调指出，研究湖泊特性需要同时研究湖泊水文、地质、地貌、水化学及水生物等，但湖泊学并非上述学科简单的结合，而系一门独立的综合性科学。
    根据湖泊自然现象统一的原则，研究湖泊大致可分为两个方面：
      （1）以湖泊水体为主，研究发生在湖水中的水文、生物、化学、物理现象和过程。
      （2）以湖盆形态作为对象，来研究湖泊水体的自然环境，认识湖泊的成因、发育、变迁以及与水体之间的相互关系。
    通过这两方面的研究，就能获得湖泊科学的完整概念，为改造和综合利用湖泊资源提供全面的科学依据。否则，湖泊科学离开了水体，就不可能有研究内容，而研究水体忽视了它的自然环境，也就将失去其依存的基本条件。客观情况决定了湖泊科学研究必须遵循综合的方向。
    应该指出，湖泊综合研究不仅不排斥各独立学科的发展，而且只能是对它们的发展起积极促进作用。综合研究的原则，也绝非不考虑时间、地点和条件，生硬地将一切研究内容平行罗列，而是根据湖泊分布的具体特点，以服务于生产需要为目的来确定研究任务，并且应该以某一最突出的生产问题，以某一门学科为中心进行综合研究。像长江中、下游沿岸的湖泊，可能最迫切需要解决的是水产资源的扩大开发利用的问题。在这个地区进行调查研究就应该以湖泊水生物为重点，其他工作则环绕水生物这个中心，提供它所需要的资料，并兼顾湖泊的其他方面的问题，如航运交通，给水灌溉、湖积矿床等。随着地区的改变，科学研究的中心任务必将发生相应的变化。对高原或者干旱地区的湖泊，就可能以探索矿床、服务于化学工业、寻找水源、改变气候为主要研究内容；但也不排斥对其他生产问题的研究。湖泊也同其他自然资源一样，必须坚持综合开发、综合利用的方针。湖泊资源普查、研究站观测和室内实验三结合
    认识自然和改造自然，必须有完善的科学方法。对湖泊中发生的各现象和过程，要求掌握其变化、发展规律，要使所解决的实际湖泊生产问题，建立在长期的、系统的、全面的科学资料基础上。湖泊研究工作，既要采用流动性的短期湖泊资源的综合普查，野外固定湖泊研究站的系统观测，还须进行室内实验，以便与野外调查观测相互验证。通过这三种方法的密切结合，就可以为解决某些具有重大生产价值和科学意义的研究课题，得出比较正确的结论。
    湖泊资源综合普查，是一种临时性的湖泊查勘工作。尽管目前我国湖泊科学还处于初创阶段，但许多国民经济部门已经对湖泊科学提出了要求。因此，首先组织湖泊资源综合普查，是服务于国民经济需要的重要途径，而且也是湖泊科学迅速发展的最好步骤。
    湖泊资源综合普查的内容，一般应该包括下列几个方面：湖泊水文，湖泊地质、地貌，滨湖自然地理，湖泊水生生物，湖泊水化学特性，以及湖泊经济调查等方面；并研究湖盆形态及其形成、变迁规律，发现湖积矿床，了解水生资源蕴藏和分布，湖泊水化学成份的含量及其变化，掌握湖泊水文特性，湖泊水量调节，湖水运动情况，调查湖泊利用现状等等。科学研究工作上许多需要深入探讨的具有重大生产价值的实际课题，都是从全面综合的资源普查中提出的。
    湖泊资源综合普查工作，要求进行得愈快愈好。如前所述，我国湖泊不仅数量多，而且分布广，如果只依靠少数专业机构来承担这项任务，势必发展缓慢。湖泊科学研究，也应该和进行其他社会主义建设事业一样，要大搞群众运动，发挥群众的积极性和他们的无穷智慧。由于滨湖人民与湖泊有着密切的经济生活的关系，他们深切地了解它，熟悉它。鄱阳湖区的广大人民，根据长期生活的丰富经验，已经掌握了湖泊水位变化的特性。目前正在中共江西省委的领导下，开展大规模的与湖争地、向湖滩进军的运动。此外，滨湖人民对风浪预测、水产养殖、捕捞方面，也都积累了极为宝贵的经验。可以深信，依靠群众，向群众学习，湖泊研究工作一定可以得到更好的效果。科学研究单位和有关经济部门应当承担起技术顾问的责任，选择若干不同地区的典型湖泊，进行带有试验性的深入调查研究，摸索一套方法，拟定出比较完整的符合于实际的调查技术规范，介绍推广，作为全面普查工作中的技术指导。
    固定湖泊研究站的观测是指长期性的观测研究工作，它是湖泊研究工作中最主要的一个方面。它与湖泊资源普查，是不可分割的两个环节，也可以说是“点与面”的结合。固定研究站选择的对象，应该是根据我国不同地区的各类大型湖泊来建立综合性的实验研究基地。实验站研究的主要内容是水量平衡、沙量平衡、热量平衡、化学平衡，以及波浪、湖流状况，湖泊气候调节，水生生物生态条件、生活习性等，并从理论上探讨各种要素的变化规律。
      实验研究是科学工作中不可缺少的组成部门。野外观测常常需要较长的时间，才能找到规律，而为了研究各种自然因素之间的相互关系及其影响条件，还必须辅以室内实验。如研究湖（库）岸变形，风浪的形成与发展，模型实验能更快获得成果。实验数据与观测资料的相互验证，就有助于提高研究质量，解决生产问题，并使论据充分。因此湖泊科学应该遵循定性和定量分析并重，短期普查、长期观测、室内实验相结合的原则，使理论真正具有指导生产实践的普遍意义。
    由于湖泊状况和水库状况具有极大的相似性，因此研究湖泊的目的，不仅是为了有效地综合利用湖泊，而且对已建水库的运用和拟建水库的设计都具有重要的指导意义。可以预料，今后几年开展水库的研究工作，将会成为我国湖泊学最重要的组成部分。
    目前，湖泊资源普查已在一些地区进行，如中国科学院水生生物研究所，对数百处大小湖泊的水生物作了调查，中国科学院南京地理研究所，不仅进行了江苏湖泊的综合普查，而且还在江苏筹建了一处综合性的湖泊实验站。中国科学院青海、甘肃综合考察队对柴达木地区盐湖进行了大量的调查研究工作。此外，有关产业部门、高等学校和地方有关单位也都在积极组织开展这方面的工作。尽管目前湖泊的调查研究工作规模还不够大，经验还很缺乏，质量还不很高，但是我们坚信，在党的正确领导与关怀下，湖泊科学这一新学科，将随着一日千里的大跃进的形势，随着科学研究队伍的成长和壮大而不断发展，并迅速赶上世界先进水平。
