Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th: The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs' National Council meeting concluded in Tokyo today. The meeting, which lasted for two days, summarized the achievements of the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and, based on the conference's recommendations, decided to launch a "Joint International Action Month" across Japan from September 20th to October 30th.

    The meeting decided that the central demands of the "Joint International Action Month" are to prohibit the testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs, to prevent the flight of U.S. spy planes, to prevent the transport of nuclear weapons into Japan, to demand the withdrawal of foreign military bases, and to request that governments of all countries urge the UN General Assembly to make decisions promoting the conclusion of international agreements on complete disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing. The meeting decided to launch a movement during the Action Month to promote and study the various resolutions of the World Conference.

    The meeting also unanimously decided that during the Action Month, mass actions will be launched in Niijima, Tokaimura, Kita-Fuji, and Okinawa to demand the withdrawal of military bases and to oppose the entry of the U.S. Seventh Fleet into Japanese ports.

    The meeting heard reports from twenty-two representatives of the Ten Thousand Kilometer Peace March participants regarding the march. The meeting unanimously agreed that the march not only contributed to the success of the World Conference but also helped the future development of the peace movement.

    At yesterday's meeting, the Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, Kaoru Yasui, emphasized in his speech that the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs successfully pointed out the correct direction for the peace movement. Yasui said that the great significance of the World Conference lies in its drawing a clear line between the enemies of peace and the friends of peace. He emphasized that "the World Conference announced that only through resolute struggle against the enemies of peace can we open up prospects for the prohibition of nuclear weapons, complete disarmament, and peaceful coexistence. Clarifying this is a tremendous contribution of the conference to our movement."

    Yasui continued, "Because of the activism of the anti-imperialist fighters of Asia and Africa and the Japanese peace fighters tempered in the struggle against the 'Security Treaty,' the Sixth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs became a world conference worthy of being called militant."
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: The Culture Department of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) published a summary of the JCP's Joint Conference of National Propaganda and Education and Culture Ministers in the "Akahata" newspaper today, calling on cultural figures to strengthen the struggle to abolish the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

    In the summary titled "On the Activities of Intellectuals and Cultural Figures in the Struggle Against the Security Treaty," the JCP highly praised the role played by Japanese intellectuals and cultural figures in the struggle.

    The summary pointed out that they not only independently organized demonstrations, rallies, and signature campaigns, but also participated in the unified actions of the people nationwide, actively supporting the workers' strikes. They also used their own weapons to give a strong rebuff to the enemy's reactionary propaganda.

    The summary emphasized the basic principles for future struggle. The summary called for uniting the democratic forces among intellectuals and cultural figures, and combining the struggle to abolish the new "Security Treaty" with the struggle for creative freedom for cultural figures.

    据新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会全国理事会会议今天在东京闭幕。这次会议举行了两天，总结了第六届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会所取得的成就，并且根据世界大会的建议，决定从9月20日起到10月30日止在日本全国展开“国际共同行动月”。
    会议决定“国际共同行动月”的中心要求是禁止试验原子弹和氢弹、阻止美国间谍飞机飞行、阻止把核武器运进日本、要求撤销外国军事基地和要求各国政府促使联合国大会作出促进缔结彻底裁军和禁止试验核武器国际协定的决定。会议决定，将在行动月期间展开宣传和学习世界大会各项决定的运动。
    会议并一致决定，在行动月期间将在新岛、东海村、北富士和冲绳展开群众行动，要求撤销军事基地，并且反对美国第七舰队开进日本港口。
    会议听取了一万公里和平大游行参加者的二十二名代表关于大游行的报告。会议一致认为大游行不仅为促使世界大会取得胜利作出了贡献，并且有助于今后和平运动的发展。
    在昨天的会议上，日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁在讲话中强调说，第六届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会成功地指出了和平运动的正确方向。安井郁说，世界大会的重大意义在于，它划清了和平的敌人与和平的朋友之间的界线。他强调说，“世界大会宣布，只有通过反对和平的敌人的坚决斗争，才能为禁止核武器，全面裁军与和平共处开辟前景。阐明这一点是大会对我们的运动的巨大贡献。”
    安井郁接着说，“由于亚洲和非洲的反帝战士和在反对‘安全条约’的斗争中受到锻炼的日本和平战士的积极性，第六届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会才成为称得上战斗性的世界大会。”
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会文化部今天在“赤旗报”上发表了日共全国宣传教育、文化部长联席会议的总结，号召文化界人士加强废除日美军事同盟条约的斗争。
    日共在这个题为“关于在反对安全条约斗争中知识分子和文化人士的活动”的总结中对日本知识分子和文化界人士在斗争中所起的作用给予很高的评价。
    总结指出，他们不仅单独组织示威游行、集会和征集签名运动，并且参加了全国人民的统一行动，积极支持了工人的罢工。他们还利用自己的武器对敌人的反动宣传给予了坚强的回击。
    总结强调指出了今后斗争的基本方针。总结号召汇集知识分子和文化界人士中的民主力量，把争取废除新“安全条约”和争取文化界人士的创作自由的斗争结合起来。
