    "Second Team Leader"
    In our commune's Caojiagou Production Team, there's a poor peasant commune member named Pan Wen, whom everyone calls "Second Team Leader."

    During the spring plowing this year, the production team had six drags, which weren't working very well. Some people suggested buying new ones. At this time, Pan Wen said, "Our team is prosperous now, but we must live frugally even when we are rich. In 1958, we only had four drags, and we still managed to drag all the land. This year we have six, and even though they aren't working well, we can repair them! We've used even more broken ones in the past." Under his insistence, they finally used these six old drags to drag 3,500 mu of land.

    Currently, our commune is harvesting autumn crops. A young commune member, just trying to be quick, scattered some oat ears. He went to this commune member and carefully calculated the losses, and then said, "When your father was alive in the old society, he wore out his tongue trying to borrow two jin of flour from others, saying all sorts of nice things, but still couldn't borrow it. Now that we have a good life, we shouldn't throw away grain!" The young man blushed with shame and never dared to waste grain again. Eighteenth Brigade Commune, Hebei

### “二队长”

    “二队长”
    我们公社曹家沟生产小队，有个贫农社员叫潘文，人人都称他是“二队长”。
    今年春耕的时候，生产小队里有六块耱，不大好使，有的人主张买几块新的；这时，潘文说：“咱们队现在富裕了，富日子可得当穷日子过。1958年只有四块耱，也把地耱完了，今年有六块，虽说不好使，可以修理呀！过去比这个更破的咱们也使用过。”在他的坚持下，终于用这六块旧耱耱完了三千五百亩地。
    目前，我们公社正在收秋。有一个年轻的社员只图快，丢撒了一些莜麦穗。他过去就找这个社员算细账，末后又说：“旧社会你爹活着的时候，为向别人借二斤面，磨破了嘴，好话说了一大堆，还是借不到；如今有了好生活，可不该乱丢乱撒啊。”说得小伙子红了脸，很惭愧，再不敢丢撒粮食了。　河北十八顷公社
