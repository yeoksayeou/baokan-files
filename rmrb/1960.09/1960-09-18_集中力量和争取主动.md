Concentrate Strength and Strive for Initiative

    The Guiyang area adopted the method of "five concentrations" in construction, completing iron and steel infrastructure projects ahead of schedule in just forty days, equivalent to 112.2% of the actual projects completed in the first half of the year. The speed and the effectiveness fully demonstrate that concentrating basic construction strength to complete key projects is a very successful method.
    The "five concentrations" refer to concentrating leadership, concentrating labor, concentrating materials, concentrating equipment, and concentrating transportation capacity. In essence, it means concentrating the use of manpower and resources to accelerate the progress of construction. Old China left us with a state of "utter poverty," and almost everything had to be started from scratch. The faster the speed of basic construction, the faster the face of poverty and backwardness would change. Therefore, building more and building faster became the urgent demand of the people of the whole country. The method of concentrating strength and ensuring key projects in basic construction is precisely the method of achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results. Because of concentrated strength, the labor force, technical strength, raw materials, and materials necessary for engineering construction can be fully guaranteed. Because of concentrated strength, we can quickly start a batch, quickly complete a batch, and achieve quick victories. Because of concentrated strength, we can give full play to the role of manpower and material resources and prevent the waste of manpower and material resources.
    Concentrating the use of manpower and material resources in basic construction is both a construction policy issue and a leadership method issue. In running any undertaking, it is very important to put oneself in an active position at all times. Being passive is always unfavorable. For example, in war, being passive often makes it easy to be beaten. By striving for the initiative, it is easier to exert combat power and overcome the enemy to win. Strategically "one against ten" and tactically "ten against one" are the strategic thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong in guiding our revolutionary war to victory, and these ideas are equally applicable to the current socialist construction. In basic construction, starting everything at once may mean starting early, but it also means delaying the construction period and delaying completion, with manpower and material resources unable to play their role in a timely manner, which is passive. Concentrating strength, starting construction in batches and phases, completing one batch and then another, means that manpower and material resources are put in place and can produce immediate results and achieve rapid results, which is active. It can be seen that the construction method of concentrating manpower and material resources is an effective leadership method that puts our basic construction in an active position.
    Concentrating basic construction strength and accelerating the progress of key projects is an effective experience that has been followed by basic construction departments over the years. The reason why the construction progress of key projects in Guizhou, Shenyang and other places has been greatly accelerated is the result of making full use of this experience.

### 集中力量和争取主动

    集中力量和争取主动
    贵阳地区采用五集中的施工方法，在短短四十天中，提前竣工的钢铁基建项目，等于上半年实际完成项目的112.2％。速度之快，效果之大，充分证明集中基本建设力量，完成重点工程是一个十分成功的方法。
    五集中，是指集中领导，集中劳力，集中材料，集中设备，集中运力。实际上就是集中使用人力和物力，达到加速建设进度的目的。旧中国留给我们的是“一贫如洗”的局面，许多事情差不多要从头做起。基本建设的速度愈快，贫穷落后的面貌就改变得愈快。因此，多建设一些，快建设一些，就成了全国人民的迫切要求。基本建设中的集中力量、保证重点的方法，正是多快好省的方法。因为集中力量，工程建设必需的劳动力、技术力量、原料材料可以得到充分的保证。因为集中力量，可以迅速开工一批，迅速建成一批，速战速决，一气呵成。因为集中力量，可以充分发挥人力物力的作用，防止人力物力的浪费。
    在基本建设中集中使用人力物力，既是建设方针问题，也是领导方法问题。办任何事业，时时刻刻使自己立于主动地位，是一件十分重要的事情。被动总是不利的。比如打仗，被动了常常容易挨打。争取了主动，就易于发挥战力，克敌致胜。在战略上“以一当十”，在战术上“以十当一”，这是毛泽东同志百战百胜地指导我国革命战争的战略思想，这些思想同样适用于当前的社会主义建设。在基本建设中，一齐上马，开工虽早，但工期延缓，竣工很晚，人力、物力都不能及时发挥作用，这就被动了。集中力量，分批分期开工，干完一批，再干一批，人力、物力投进去，能立竿见影，速收实效，这就主动了。由此可见，集中人力物力的建设方法，是一种使我们的基本建设立于主动地位的有效的领导方法。
    集中基本建设力量，加速重点工程的进度，是基本建设部门历年来行之有效的经验，贵州、沈阳等地重点工程建设进度所以能够大大加快，就是充分运用这个经验的结果。
