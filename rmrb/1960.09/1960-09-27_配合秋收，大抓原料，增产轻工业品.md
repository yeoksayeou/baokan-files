Coordinating with the autumn harvest, vigorously seizing raw materials, and increasing the production of light industrial goods.

The fourth quarter is a season of decisive significance for light industry to complete and overfulfill the annual production plan, and it is also a good opportunity for light industry to substantially increase production. In the vigorous mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy centered on grain and steel, light industrial enterprises should, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, fully mobilize the masses, further boost their energy, seize the good opportunity after the autumn harvest, vigorously seize raw materials, and focus on quality, variety, and specifications, striving to comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill this year's national plan in order to further meet social needs.

On the basis of two consecutive years of great leaps forward in China's light industrial production, the first eight months of this year still maintained a good situation of continuous leap forward. The output of major products and small commodities increased significantly compared with the same period last year. Product quality has also improved to varying degrees. However, because the demand for light industrial products from 650 million people is growing rapidly, light industrial production must have even greater growth. To increase the production of light industrial products, we must first expand the source of raw materials, increase production, and conserve raw materials. The more abundant the reserves of raw materials, and the more raw materials are increased and saved, the greater the possibility and potential for increasing the production of light industrial products. Now is the season of autumn harvest and "small autumn harvest." About two-thirds of light industrial raw materials come from rural areas, and most of them are harvested in autumn and winter. Taking advantage of this opportunity to vigorously seize raw materials and prepare sufficient materials is not only related to the substantial increase in light industrial production this winter but also to the arrangement of next year's production. At the same time, helping the people's communes to collect, harvest, transport, store, process agricultural and sideline products and wild raw materials is also the greatest support for agriculture. Therefore, under the leadership of local Party committees, cooperating with agriculture, commerce, and transportation departments to actively participate in and do a good job in the collection, purchase, transportation, storage, and processing of agricultural products and wild raw materials is the most urgent task for the light industry sector to support agriculture and expand the source of raw materials. All light industrial enterprises that use agricultural and sideline products as their main raw materials should mobilize as many employees as possible to go to the countryside and help the people's communes do a good job in autumn harvest and "small autumn harvest" in terms of manpower and technology. While actively helping the people's communes prepare tools for harvesting and transporting sugar beets, the light industry department of Heilongjiang Province mobilized more than one-third of the employees of six major sugar factories to go to the countryside to help harvest, store, and transport sugar beets. This practice of supporting agriculture and vigorously seizing raw materials is worth greatly promoting. For general agricultural and sideline products, such as milk, eggs, pigskins, fruits, vegetables, etc., light industrial enterprises should also give play to their active spirit and cooperate with commercial departments to seize the purchase.

Wild raw materials are playing an increasingly important role in light industrial production. Light industrial enterprises should, through factory-commune ties or other methods, under the unified arrangement of the local Party committee, cooperate with the "small autumn harvest" movement to concentrate all wild plants that can be used as light industrial raw materials as much as possible. For those wild raw materials that are inconvenient to transport or easily deteriorate, processing should be organized locally. Light industrial enterprises should help the people's communes trial-produce and manufacture simple processing machinery for shelling, crushing, and peeling wild plants to save labor and increase the yield. This is not only beneficial to agricultural production but also beneficial to industrial departments to increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs. This year, the paper industry in various regions helped the people's communes use various grass resources to produce a large amount of local grass pulp, which not only increased the income of the people's communes but also increased the output of paper, which is a good thing that achieves two goals at once. Therefore, we should continue to help these small local groups of enterprises technically to improve production efficiency, improve quality, reduce costs, and provide more and better raw materials for the paper industry.

About one-third of the raw materials in light industry come from the metallurgical industry and the chemical industry. In addition to actively supporting the metallurgical and chemical industries to increase production, light industrial enterprises should also directly produce some themselves, striving to solve a part of the chemical and metal raw materials themselves. Under the leadership and unified arrangement of the local Party committee, many enterprises have actively relied on the masses to establish satellite factories or workshops for producing chemical raw materials and metal raw materials according to the needs of enterprise production, and have carried out diversified operations and comprehensive utilization, which has achieved practical results. For these small local and foreign groups of enterprises that produce chemical and metal raw materials, those that have not yet started normal production should seize the time to put them into production, and those that have already started production should vigorously rectify, consolidate, and improve them.

Increasing production and conserving raw materials are closely linked. If we only increase production without conservation, using more materials that should be used less, using good materials for those that should use inferior materials, and using whole materials for those that should use scrap materials, the actual effect of increasing production of raw materials will be greatly reduced. Only by increasing production and conserving at the same time can the effect be great. Therefore, rational and economical use of raw materials is a principle that must be adhered to at all times. Widely adopting substitutes can not only supplement the shortage of some raw materials but also, when the performance of the substitutes is suitable for the requirements of product manufacturing, the substitutes become the new raw materials for this product. On the basis of rational and economical use of raw materials, many factories have carried out comprehensive utilization. Without disrupting the original cooperative relationship, the factory's waste gas, waste water, waste residue, and waste materials are fully utilized, which not only increases the source of raw materials but also increases social wealth. All of these are practical and effective methods, and light industrial enterprises should, under the premise of strictly ensuring product quality, reduce raw material consumption, increase the yield of products, reduce losses in the production process, adopt substitutes, comprehensively utilize and recycle, as a regular and important task. In the current situation, this should be done especially.

In the process of solving the problem of raw materials, we must implement the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, making do with whatever is available, using indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and focusing on small scale, and avoid being greedy for large scale and foreign methods. At the same time, we must follow the principle of using local materials and adapting to local conditions, and find raw materials or substitutes locally or nearby as much as possible, instead of running thousands of miles to find them outside. Funds, equipment, and labor must also be solved by ourselves in order to be feasible and reliable. Combining indigenous and foreign methods, focusing on small scale, and solving the problem of raw materials by using local materials and adapting to local conditions can greatly shorten the transportation distance, reduce costs, and make the layout of China's light industry more reasonable, and closely combine the expansion of light industrial raw material sources with the development of local resources. This not only develops light industry but also develops local economic undertakings, achieving two goals with one arrow, which is of great benefit.

In the fourth quarter, the production task of light industry is very heavy. The current situation is very favorable. The light industry department must make full use of the current favorable opportunity, first of all, work with relevant departments to quickly obtain the raw materials that can be obtained, and at the same time actively increase production and conserve raw materials, striving for a greater increase in light industrial production in the fourth quarter and next year. This is a very important task. The leading departments and enterprises of light industry at all levels should have the main leaders take charge of raw materials, and tell the employees about the current production tasks and the current favorable situation, and tell the employees the key to completing the tasks, so that everyone understands the important significance of seizing raw materials currently, everyone thinks of ways, and everyone starts to do it. China has a vast territory and abundant resources, and raw material resources are very rich. As long as we truly mobilize the masses, go to the mountains and down to the countryside, seize the raw materials, prepare sufficient raw materials, and vigorously increase production and conserve raw materials, light industrial production will surely achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive sustained leap forward!

    配合秋收，大抓原料，增产轻工业品
    第四季度，是轻工业完成和超额完成全年生产计划具有决定意义的季节，也是轻工业大幅度增产的良好时机。在轰轰烈烈的以粮、钢为中心的增产节约全民运动中，轻工业企业应在各级党委的领导下，充分发动群众，进一步鼓足干劲，利用秋后良机，大抓原料，大抓质量、品种、规格，争取全面完成和超额完成今年国家计划，以进一步满足社会需要。
    我国轻工业生产在接连两年跃进的基础上，今年前八个月仍然保持着持续跃进的良好局面。主要产品和小商品的产量比去年同期增长很多。产品质量也有不同程度的改进。但是，由于六亿五千万人民对轻工业品的需要增长很快，轻工业生产就必须有更大的增长。要增产轻工业品，首先必须扩大原料来源，增产和节约原料。原料愈是储备得充足，增产和节约的原料愈多，轻工业品增产的可能性和潜力也就越大。现在，正是秋收和“小秋收”季节。轻工业原料有三分之二左右来自农村，其中绝大部分又是在秋冬两季收获的。趁此时机，大抓原料，把原料准备充足，这不仅关系到今冬轻工业的大幅度增产，而且关系到明年生产的安排。同时帮助人民公社把农副产品和野生原料采好、收好、运好、藏好、加工好，也是对农业的最大支援。因此，在地方党委领导下，配合农业、商业和交通部门，积极参加和做好农业产品和野生原料的采集、收购、运输、保管和加工工作，这是轻工业部门支援农业和扩大原料来源的当务之急。凡是以农副产品为主要原料的轻工业企业，都要动员尽可能多的职工，到农村去，从人力上、技术上帮助人民公社做好秋收和“小秋收”工作。黑龙江省的轻工业部门在积极帮助人民公社准备糖料收割和运输工具的同时，六个大糖厂又动员了三分之一以上职工下乡帮助收获、保管和运输甜菜。这种支援农业、大抓原料的做法，值得大大提倡。对于一般农副产品，如乳、蛋、猪皮、水果、蔬菜等等，轻工业企业也要发挥积极主动精神，配合商业部门抓紧收购。
    野生原料在轻工业生产中的作用愈来愈大。轻工业企业要通过厂社挂钩或其他方法，在当地党委的统一安排下，配合“小秋收”运动，把一切可以用作轻工业原料的野生植物尽可能地集中起来。对于那些不便运输或者容易变质的野生原料，要就地组织加工。轻工业企业应当帮助人民公社试制和制造野生植物的脱壳、粉碎、剥皮等等简易加工机械，以便节省劳动力和提高收得率。这不但有利于农业生产，也有利于工业部门增加产量，提高质量，降低成本。今年各地造纸工业帮助人民公社用各种草类资源生产了大量的土草浆，既增加了人民公社的收入，又增加了纸张的产量，是一举两得的好事，因此应当继续从技术上帮助这些小土群企业提高生产效率，改进质量，降低成本，为造纸工业提供更多更好的原料。
    在轻工业的原材料中，还有三分之一左右来自冶金工业和化学工业。轻工业企业除了积极支援冶金、化学工业增加产量而外，也应当自己直接生产一些，力求自己解决一部分化工和金属原材料。许多企业在地方党委的领导和统一安排下，积极依靠群众，根据企业生产的需要，建立生产化工原料和金属原料的卫星工厂或车间，开展多种经营和综合利用，已经收到了实际效果。像这样一些生产化工、金属原料的小土群、小洋群企业，尚未正常生产的要抓紧投入生产，已经开始生产的要大力整顿、巩固和提高。
    增产和节约原材料是密切联系着的。只增产而不节约，该少用料的多用了，该用次料的用了好料，该用零料的用了整料，增产原料的实际效果就会大大减小。只有又增产又节约，效果才大。所以，合理而节约地使用原材料是任何时候必须坚持的原则。广泛地采用代用品，不仅可以补充若干原材料供应的不足，而且当代用品的性能适合于产品制造的要求时，代用品就成为这种产品的新原料。不少工厂在合理而节约地使用原材料的基础上，开展了综合利用，在不打乱原有协作关系的原则下，把工厂的废气、废水、废渣、废物充分地加以利用，既增加了原料来源，又增加了社会财富。所有这些，都是切实可行的有效办法，轻工业企业都应当在严格保证产品质量的前提下，把降低原材料消耗，提高出品率，减少生产过程中的流失，采用代用品，综合利用和回收再用，作为经常的重要任务。在当前，尤其应当这样做。
    在解决原材料问题的过程中，必须贯彻执行勤俭办企业的方针，因陋就简，土法上马，土洋结合，小型为主，不要贪大求洋。同时要本着就地取材，因地制宜的方针，尽可能在当地或者附近找原料或代用品，而不要千里迢迢跑到外面去找。资金、设备和劳动力，也必须自己解决，才行得通，靠得住。土洋结合，小型为主与就地取材，因地制宜地解决原材料问题，就可以大大缩短运输里程，降低成本，又可以使我国轻工业的布局更加合理，把扩大轻工业原材料来源和开发地方资源紧密地结合起来，这样既发展了轻工业，又发展了地方经济事业，一箭双雕，好处很大。
    在第四季度，轻工业的生产任务很大。当前的形势十分有利。轻工业部门必须充分利用当前的有利时机，首先同有关部门，把可以到手的原料，都迅速拿到手，同时积极增产和节约原材料，争取第四季度和明年轻工业生产达到更大幅度的增产。这是一件十分重要的工作，轻工业各级领导部门和企业，要由主要的领导人来抓原料，并且要把当前的生产任务和当前的有利形势告诉职工，把完成任务的关键告诉职工，使大家都明白当前要狠抓原材料的重要意义，大家想办法，大家来动手。我国地大物博，原料资源是很丰富的，只要我们真正把群众发动起来，上山下乡，把原料抓好，把原料准备充足，同时大力增产和节约原材料，轻工业生产就一定能更大更好更全面地持续跃进！
