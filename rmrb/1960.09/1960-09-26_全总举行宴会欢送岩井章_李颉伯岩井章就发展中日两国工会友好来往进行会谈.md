Xinhua News Agency, September 25th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) held a banquet tonight to bid farewell to Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), and his accompanying secretary, Kami Tsuma Yoshiaki.

　　Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the ACFTU, spoke at the banquet. He said that the Chinese workers and people resolutely support the great anti-American patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people in the past, present, and future. He believes that the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism, demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and demanding the withdrawal of U.S. military bases will surely be victorious.

　　Liu Ningyi said that the Chinese and Japanese people should join hands closely and further strengthen the friendship between the two peoples, advancing shoulder to shoulder to oppose our common enemy, U.S. imperialism.

　　Iwai Akira spoke at the banquet, thanking Chinese friends for their support of the Japanese people's struggle. He said, "We deeply feel that in the future struggle to withdraw U.S. military bases and abolish the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, we must cooperate closely and fight together with Chinese friends."

　　Iwai Akira said that although his stay in China was short, he exchanged views on the current situation with Chinese trade union leaders. He said, "We will move forward with even greater confidence along our path in the future."

　　Iwai Akira said that during this visit, he saw that China had achieved a very great leap forward, and he hoped that the Chinese people would achieve an even greater leap forward.

　　The banquet was attended by Liu Changsheng, Zhu Xuefan, and Li Jiebo, Vice-Chairmen of the ACFTU; Li Zaizhi, Kang Yonghe, Secretaries of the Secretariat; heads of various departments and industrial trade unions of the ACFTU; heads of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions; and well-known figures from all walks of life in the capital: Liao Chengzhi, Chu Tunan, Yang Hansheng, Zhao Puchu, Xu Guangping, Hu Yuzhi, Liu Qingyang, Yang Haibo, Yang Zheng, and Yang Chunsong, among others.

　　Japanese peace activist Kinkazu Saionji, who was in Beijing, and Japanese friends visiting China were also invited to attend the banquet.

　　Before the banquet, the ACFTU held a cocktail party for Mr. Iwai Akira.

　　Xinhua News Agency, September 25th. Li Jiebo, Vice-Chairman of the ACFTU, Kang Yonghe, Secretary of the Secretariat, and Chen Yu, Director of the International Liaison Department, held talks with Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and his secretary, Kami Tsuma Yoshiaki, on September 23rd and 25th.

　　The two sides exchanged views on the current international situation and reached a consensus. Both sides expressed that in the future common struggle against U.S. imperialism, Chinese and Japanese workers will continue to support and encourage each other.

　　The two sides exchanged views on the further development of friendly exchanges between Chinese and Japanese trade unions, and unanimously agreed that not only should friendly delegations continue to be exchanged between the ACFTU and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, but also friendly delegations should continue to be exchanged between Chinese and Japanese industrial trade unions and local trade unions. The ACFTU welcomes Japanese grassroots trade unions and grassroots activists to visit China.
