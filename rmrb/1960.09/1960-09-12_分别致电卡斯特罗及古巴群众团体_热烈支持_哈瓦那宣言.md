Xinhua News Agency, 11th. The Secretariat of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee today sent a telegram to Cuban Prime Minister Castro, supporting the Havana Declaration. The text of the telegram is as follows: To Prime Minister Fidel Castro:

	We express our respect and support for the heroic stance taken by your government in the face of US imperialist attempts to interfere with the sacred rights of the Cuban nation. We wish, through you, to pay tribute to the Cuban people who formulated the Havana Declaration. It is a great contribution to the struggle for peace, independence, progress and equality among nations, and it is a heavy blow to the enemies of peace, US imperialist aggression and interference. The people of the Asian and Pacific regions, as well as the peoples of Africa and the world, see the unity and mutual support of the Latin American countries as a solid guarantee for defending peace and independence. We pay tribute to Latin American unity and mutual support, and to the Cuban people—the vanguard of this fighting alliance. We welcome Cuba's decision to establish relations with the People's Republic of China—the first link between Latin America and this country of 650 million people, and we believe that this is another step forward in striving to make the Pacific a region of peace, so that the people of all countries in this region can get rid of the plague of imperialist aggression and war and develop complete sovereignty.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th. The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace Defense today sent a telegram to the Cuban Movement for the Defense of Peace and the Sovereignty of All Peoples, and forwarded it to Prime Minister Castro, warmly endorsing and firmly supporting the "Havana Declaration."

	The telegram stated that this historic declaration is a solemn indictment by the Cuban and Latin American people of the US imperialist crimes of aggression. It demonstrates the determination of the Cuban people to defend their revolution and maintain their independence, and it also reflects the common will of the Latin American countries to oppose aggression and safeguard independence and sovereignty. The "Havana Declaration" greatly encourages the just struggle of the people of Latin America, Asia, Africa and the world against US imperialism and its running dogs and for the defense of world peace. The telegram said that the Chinese people express their warm welcome to the solemn announcement by the Cuban National Congress to sever all relations with the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime and establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. This is of great significance for strengthening the friendship between the Chinese and Cuban people, and between the Chinese and Latin American people.

	The telegram stated that the Chinese people will further strengthen solidarity and cooperation with the heroic Cuban people, and unremittingly strive to defeat the aggression and war policies of US imperialism, the common enemy of the Chinese and Cuban people, and the people of the world, and to defend world peace. The telegram concluded by wishing the Cuban people continuous new victories.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th. The China Federation of Literary and Art Circles recently sent a telegram to the Casa de las Américas in Cuba, warmly praising and supporting the "Havana Declaration."

	The telegram stated that the "Havana Declaration" represents the strong fighting will of the Cuban people and the people of Latin American countries, and is an indictment by the Cuban people and the people of Latin American countries against US imperialism. It points out the path of struggle for the Cuban people and the people of Latin American countries, and will powerfully encourage the struggle of the Cuban people and the people of Latin American countries to crush the US imperialist conspiracy of aggression.

	The telegram stated that the "Havana Declaration" solemnly announced the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cuba, and Chinese literary and art workers are very pleased about this. We would like to extend our warm congratulations to you. In the future, our two countries will unite more closely and support each other, and fight to the end against US imperialist aggression and to defend world peace. Victory will surely belong to us.
