Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement on the 5th, condemning the Ikeda government's "new policy" as "not touching upon major political issues and benefiting large enterprises."

    The Socialist Party pointed out that in terms of foreign policy, it is still tilting towards the United States as before. The policy shows that the Japanese government is acting in accordance with the United States on the issue of Sino-Japanese relations. The Socialist Party said that this shows that the government is overly dependent on the United States. The Socialist Party pointed out the difference between the government's demand for the Soviet Union to "return" South Sakhalin Island and its suppression of the demand for the United States to return Okinawa Island in its new policy.

    The Socialist Party pointed out that in terms of economic policy, the focus is on government investment, and the proposed tax cuts are to reduce the burden on large monopoly capitalists. Japan's industrial and mining output has increased threefold compared to pre-war levels, but the people's living standards have not improved accordingly, and the income gap between various classes in the country is widening.

    In addition, the Democratic Socialist Party supported the Socialist Party's views in a statement on the 5th. The Democratic Socialist Party said that the policy pursued by the Ikeda government is the same as that of Nobusuke Kishi, that is, over-reliance on the United States' policy.

    Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, pointed out in a statement that the Ikeda government's "new policy" shows that it will adhere to the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" system in its foreign policy. Regarding employment policy, no concrete measures have been taken for the 10 million unemployed, including potential unemployed.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 7th: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Akahata" published an editorial today, strongly condemning the Liberal Democratic Party's announcement.

    "Akahata" pointed out: "The new policy completely inherits Nobusuke Kishi's foreign policy, attacks neutralism, and reiterates Japan's adherence to the imperialist camp. Like Nobusuke Kishi's policy, the characteristic of the new policy announced by the Liberal Democratic Party headed by Ikeda is to maintain and strengthen the military alliance with the United States."

    "Akahata" emphasized when discussing domestic policy, "The Liberal Democratic Party wants to deny the people's right to launch mass actions and attempts to use 'parliamentary democracy' to maintain its reactionary rule forever."

    "Akahata" said, "'The 'new policy' emphasizes the need to accelerate the technological development of missile production."

    The editorial said when discussing the Liberal Democratic Party's economic and fiscal policies that the characteristic of this policy is to vigorously implement "enterprise rationalization" to enable monopoly capital to obtain more profits, and to strengthen state monopoly capital through state funds.

    日本社会党谴责政府“新政策”
    “赤旗报”说“新政策”的特点是加强同美国的军事联盟
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本社会党5日发表声明，谴责池田政府的“新政策”“没有触及主要的政治问题，并且有利于大企业”。
    社会党指出，在外交政策方面，仍旧是已往的向美国一边倒。政策表明，日本政府在中日关系问题上是顺从美国而行事的。社会党说，这表明政府过分依赖美国。社会党指出政府在新政策中要求苏联“归还”南库页岛，和压抑要求美国归还冲绳岛的态度之间的差别。
    社会党指出：在经济政策方面，重点放在政府的投资方面，而提出的减税是为了减少大垄断资本家的负担。日本的工矿业产量已经增加为战前的三倍，但是人民的生活水平并没有相应的提高，国内各阶层之间的收入的差别在扩大。
    另外，民主社会党5日在声明中支持社会党的看法。民主社会党说，池田政府奉行的政策同岸信介的政策是一样的，那就是过分地依靠美国的政策。
    日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章发表谈话指出，池田政府的“新政策”，在外交方面表示要坚持日美“安全条约”体制。关于就业政策方面，对包括潜在失业者在内的一千万名失业人员，并没有采取具体的措施。
    据新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，强烈谴责自由民主党发表的。
    “赤旗报”指出：“新政策原封不动地继承了岸信介的外交政策，攻击中立主义和重申日本坚持忠于帝国主义阵营的立场。同岸信介的政策一样，以池田为首的自由民主党所宣布的新政策的特点也是维护和加强同美国的军事联盟。”
    “赤旗报”在谈到国内政策时强调说，“自由民主党想否定人民展开群众行动的权利，企图利用‘议会民主’来永远保持反动统治。”
    “赤旗报”说，“‘新政策’强调需要加速导弹生产的技术发展。”
    社论在谈到自由民主党的经济和财政政策时说，这种政策的特点是厉行“企业合理化”以使垄断资本获得更多利润，并且通过国家资金来加强国家垄断资本。
