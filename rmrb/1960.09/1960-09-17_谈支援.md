    Talking About Support
      Deng Cao, Hu Xiaochun, Xinhua, Hunan

    Support. This is an ordinary noun, but today, it shines with the glory of the socialist system, and the glory of people's communist spirit. Whether it is industry supporting agriculture, cities supporting the countryside, or mutual support between various industries, all are for one purpose—to accelerate the building of socialism.
    Support is not a simple matter of you helping me and I helping you. Rather, under the unified leadership of the Party, based on the objective laws of high-speed and proportional development of the socialist economy, starting from the overall situation, and from the perspective of the whole country as one chess game, we must distinguish between primary and secondary, and between the important and the urgent. Local support for the whole, non-priority support for priority, slow support for urgent... That is to say, we must concentrate superior forces to support the key areas and the front lines. Currently, all industries must establish the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation, and must implement the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation, to ensure the high-speed development of agriculture. Only when agriculture is developed can industry obtain sufficient grain, raw materials, and a broad market, and accumulate a large amount of capital for socialist construction, driving the comprehensive development of other undertakings.
    Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and grain is the foundation of the foundation. Supporting agriculture can not only solve the big problem of feeding 650 million people, but it is also the foundation for developing industry, commerce, and all other undertakings. Since this is the case, supporting agriculture means supporting our own great cause of creating socialism. Therefore, everyone must forge ahead bravely and strive to be the first.

    谈支援
      湖南新化　邓操　胡小春
    支援，这是一个普通的名词，今天，却闪耀着社会主义制度的光辉，闪耀着人们共产主义风格的光辉，无论是工业支援农业，城市支援乡村，各行各业相互支援，都是为的一个目的——加速建成社会主义。
    支援，不是简单的你帮我、我帮你那种支援，而是在党的统一领导下，根据社会主义经济高速度、按比例发展的客观规律，从全局出发，从全国一盘棋的观点出发，分清主次，分清轻重缓急。局部支援整体，非重点支援重点，缓的支援急的……。也就是说要集中优势力量，支援重点，支援第一线。当前，各行各业都要树立以农业为基础的思想，都要贯彻以农业为基础的方针，保证农业的高速度发展。只有农业发展了，工业才能得到丰足的粮食、原料和广阔的市场，并为社会主义建设积累大量资金，带动其他事业全面发展。
    农业是国民经济的基础，粮食是基础的基础。支援了农业，不仅可以解决六亿五千万人吃饭的大问题，而且是发展工业、商业和其他一切事业的基础。既然这样，支援农业，也就是支援自己创社会主义的大业，因此，大家要勇往直前，争先恐后。
