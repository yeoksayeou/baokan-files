The Shucha People's Commune in Shucheng County, through continuous rectification, consolidation, and improvement of its management system, has rapidly embarked on a path of sound development, greatly promoting the development of agricultural production. Grain production has seen the fastest development, with the commune's total grain output in 1959 increasing by 24% compared to 1958. This year, the total wheat output increased by 28% compared to 1959, and the total early rice output increased by 34%. Grain production has leaped forward in the past two years, rapidly transforming this historically grain-deficient area into a grain-surplus area. In 1959, the commune sold a total of 11,260,000 jin of surplus grain; this year, as of August, it has sold another 10,064,000 jin of surplus grain. Tea production has also achieved increased production. In 1959, the total tea output of the commune increased by 11% compared to 1958, and this year's total output increased by 30% compared to 1959. Other diverse operations such as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fishing, and industry have also seen corresponding development.

The tremendous achievements of the Shucha Commune in the past two years prove that the people's commune, as a new production relation, is suitable for the development of productive forces in our country's rural areas. However, the people's commune has only been in existence for two years, and it cannot be said that its management and other aspects have reached a state of perfection. It must undergo a continuous process of improvement and upgrading in order to form a complete set of rules and regulations and advanced management methods. To improve the management level of the people's commune, it is necessary to grasp many aspects, one important aspect of which is production management. According to the experience of the Shucha Commune, to do a good job in production management, it is necessary to earnestly solve the following three problems:

	I. Implement the Policy of Taking Grain as the Key Link, Promoting All-Round Development, and Diversified Operations

Implementing the policy of "taking grain as the key link," promoting all-round development, and diversified operations is an important part of doing a good job in production management and promoting production development. According to the experience of the Shucha Commune, it is necessary to implement the policy of "taking grain as the key link" throughout the entire production management process, and under the guidance of this policy, formulate production plans and arrange the planting ratios of grain and economic crops according to national needs and the needs of the commune members, as well as the proportion of production investment. In the past two years, the Shucha Commune has adopted methods such as three-season cropping, expanding intercropping and mixed cropping, increasing the multiple cropping index, vigorously reclaiming wasteland, and expanding the area of cultivated land, which has greatly increased the planting area of grain crops and also expanded the area of economic crops. In 1959, the sown area of grain was 115,754 mu, accounting for 94% of the total sown area, an increase of 34,000 mu compared to 1958. This year, the sown area of grain reached 170,747 mu, an increase of 54,993 mu compared to 1959. At the same time, measures were taken such as planting peanuts on river sand beaches, sesame on reclaimed barren land, hemp in front of houses and behind villages, castor beans along roadsides, and sunflowers wherever there was space, so that the sown area of various economic crops reached 14,080 mu, an increase of 30.5% compared to last year. This has both expanded the planting area of grain crops and increased the planting area of various economic crops. In order to increase the yield per unit area of grain, the Shucha Commune also appropriately increased the cost of grain crops. In the "three guarantees," the amount of work for each mu of grain cultivated land was increased by four workdays, and the cost was increased by 1.8 yuan. This ensured the intensive cultivation and high yields of grain crops in terms of material strength. In order to increase the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members for producing grain, production teams that exceeded the grain contract output were given 10%-20% of the surplus grain as a reward. The labor remuneration for grain production and diversified operations should be reasonably assessed to achieve a general balance, so that commune members engaged in grain production and diversified operations can give full play to their initiative and enthusiasm.

	II. Taking Agriculture as the Center, Grain as the Focus, and Rationally Using Labor

The establishment of the people's commune has liberated a large amount of labor force, creating favorable conditions for fully mobilizing and rationally using labor, but it has also brought some new problems. The commune has a wide scope of operation and many production projects. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fishing, industry, and living welfare undertakings all need people. Under this new situation, how to ensure that agriculture is the center and grain is the focus, and how to rationally use labor, is an important issue in production management work. Since the Shucha Commune is a tea-producing area, the seasonality of tea production is very strong and is concentrated during the spring sowing and planting period. Therefore, how to rationally arrange and use labor, both to prominently ensure the key points, use the main labor force in agricultural production, especially grain production, and to take care of the general aspects, so that tea and other production can also be developed accordingly, is even more important. The Shucha People's Commune did this:

	First, take revolutionary measures to utilize all available labor and strengthen the agricultural front.

In the early days of the establishment of the Shucha Commune, some people did not fully understand the production policy of the people's commune, and mistakenly believed that the people's commune was a six-industry undertaking, and labor should be distributed evenly. As a result, the use of labor in some places was not concentrated enough. The labor force fixed in agriculture once accounted for only 64% of the total labor force. The commune party committee promptly checked and criticized the above-mentioned tendency, and in the spring of 1959 and 1960, in conjunction with the rectification of the commune, carried out two large-scale rectifications of labor organization. The commune successively transferred a total of 4,241 laborers to agricultural production, of which more than 80% were assigned to key grain-producing areas to participate in grain production. In this way, this year the commune fixed 82% of its total labor force in agricultural production, and more than 88% of them were strong laborers; in the use of labor in agricultural production, the use of labor in grain production accounted for 94.6%, which first guaranteed the production of grain. However, according to the survey, there are still unreasonable phenomena in the use of labor in individual links of the Shucha Commune, mainly because the quota management of enterprises such as livestock farms and agricultural machinery factories is poor, and there are too many people employed, and there is still great potential to be tapped. Recently, they have further checked and improved the use of labor, and drawn labor from all aspects into field production, so that the labor force participating in agricultural production has increased from 82% of the total labor force to 90%.

Since the Shucha Commune's adjustment of labor organization was not done by simply reducing personnel, but mainly focused on actively tapping labor potential, improving management, and improving labor efficiency, the result was that the agricultural front was strengthened and other undertakings were also developed. The commune's green tea primary processing factory is an example. This factory launched a "increase production without increasing people, increase production and reduce people" campaign this spring, implemented fixed personnel quota management, vigorously carried out technological innovation, and improved labor productivity. After transferring 29 workers to support agricultural production, the output still increased by 42% compared to last year.

	Second, flexibly dispatch labor according to the busy and slack seasons of farming.

In order to fully and rationally use rural labor, after the labor force in various aspects is basically fixed, it should also be dispatched flexibly according to the busy and slack seasons of farming, starting from the premise of being conducive to agricultural production. According to the experience of the Shucha Commune, it should mainly be carried out in the following three aspects:

	First, taking agricultural production as the main focus, flexibly dispatch the labor of commune-run industries and diversified operations such as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishing. Except for the agricultural machinery manufacturing plant which maintains year-round production, commune-run factories (farms) and enterprises generally combine with the agricultural production season. More are run during the slack season, less during the busy season, and none during the busiest season. During the busy season, they engage in agriculture, and during the slack season, they engage in industry. For example, last year, during the winter slack season, they ran nine factories such as a wild plant comprehensive utilization processing factory, a paper mill, and a brick and tile factory, creating 125,000 yuan of wealth for the commune. At the beginning of this year's spring plowing production, these factories were temporarily shut down, and the workers returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production. In the season of rushing to harvest early rice and rush-planting late rice this year, in order to ensure a complete victory in the "double rush," the commune party committee again ordered the temporary shutdown of eight factories such as feed processing factories and food processing factories, and all 253 employees were put into the "double rush." Livestock farms and horticultural farms, etc., also only left a few elderly breeders and foresters to stick to their jobs, and all other personnel were put into agricultural production. In this way, during the tense period of the "double rush," almost 100% of the commune's labor force was put into the "double rush," thereby ensuring that the "double rush" tasks could be completed on time, in quantity, and with quality. This commune also paid special attention to adopting the method of unified dispatch and coordinated production to solve the contradiction between grain and tea production in dispatching labor. Last winter slack season, more than 2,000 strong laborers were transferred from outside the mountains to dig tea gardens. This year, picking spring tea and spring sowing were squeezed together. The commune party committee transferred more than 2,500 auxiliary laborers from outside the mountains to pick tea, replacing more than 2,000 strong laborers in the mountains to help rush to plant early rice outside the mountains, thereby completing the tasks of rushing to plant and picking in a timely manner, and achieving that both grain and tea production were not delayed.

	Second, taking grain crops as the main focus, flexibly dispatch the use of labor for various economic crops. During the key periods of grain production, such as the harvest and planting seasons, the Shucha Commune adopts the method of advancing economic crops that can be advanced and postponing economic crops that can be postponed to stagger agricultural work and ensure that superior forces are used to grasp grain production.

	Third, taking current field production as the main focus, rationally arrange agricultural capital construction work such as water conservancy construction. In the past two years, the farmland capital construction of the Shucha Commune has been carried out during the winter slack season, and has been uniformly arranged with various winter field production, field management of wintering crops, especially grain crops, and winter manure accumulation campaigns. When the spring busy farming season arrived, the labor force used in water conservancy and other basic construction immediately turned to spring plowing and large-scale production, and agricultural production was not weakened because of agricultural capital construction.

	Third, arrange farm work rationally

Rationally arranging farm work is a very detailed and complex task, and it has a great relationship with improving labor efficiency. Now, the commune and team cadres of Shucha Commune have generally mastered the "five looks" method of looking at people, looking at work, looking at the weather, looking at the stubble, and looking at farm tools, and cleverly arrange farm work, thereby greatly improving labor efficiency and overcoming the phenomena of idling and wasting work. How did they master the "five looks" method? According to investigations in production teams such as Guowan and Shanbu, the main points are: First, rely on commune members to arrange farm work. The broad masses of commune members, especially the old farmers, are most clear about what work needs to be done in their team and group, what work should be done first or later, and how many people should be sent to what kind of stubble. Only by listening to the opinions of the masses can farm work be arranged reasonably. For example, in July of this year, after the Guowan production team had hoeed its 100-plus mu of corn once, the cadres planned to arrange for the entire labor force to accumulate fertilizer, while old commune member Wang Chaoduan proposed arranging some labor force to re-hoe the corn in sunny weather. In this way, not only is the hoeing faster, with one workday being worth three workdays, but one hoeing is worth three hoeings. The captain accepted this opinion and arranged for more than 40 laborers to finish hoeing the corn in two days, saving not only 80 workdays, but also preventing any weeds from growing on this piece of land due to timely re-hoeing. The cadres of this team drew a conclusion from their personal experience: "Arranging farm work requires five looks and also one 'listen,' listening to the opinions of the commune members." Second, diligently queue up and arrange farm work in short periods. The key to the "five looks" is to look at people and look at work. Looking at people is relatively easy, because the cadres and commune members of the production team are all grown up together, and they are very clear about the special talents of each commune member. However, farm work changes every day, so it is not so easy to grasp. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously and carefully queue up the farm work that should be done in each period, so that you can know it well and implement a long-term plan and a short-term arrangement, so that you can assign work reasonably and use it properly. Third, do it and turn it around. In addition to working with the commune members, the cadres of the production team should also take some time every day to turn around in the production area of their team and group to understand the overall situation, so that it is convenient to look at the work and assign people. The captains of production teams such as Guowan generally take a turn around every time a farm work is arranged to see the action of each group; they take another turn in the middle of this farm work to check the completion of the task by each group. The production team leaders take a turn around every day, depending on the situation, either early or late, to grasp the changes in production in a timely manner. In this way, farm work can be seen more accurately, and work assignment will be more reasonable.

	Fourth, Organize production teams

After communization, the scale of production teams expanded, which is in line with the needs of production development. However, from the perspective of Shucha Commune, production teams should also be established under the production team. Because the average production team has more than 200 laborers, covers an area of 2-3 kilometers, and has about 1,000 mu of land, if production teams are not divided, it is inevitable that there will be phenomena of idling and wasting work such as improper farm work arrangements and improper labor use. According to the experience of Shucha Commune, when dividing production teams, in addition to paying attention to the fact that the labor force in each team should not be too much or too little, the level of awareness of the team members, the strength of their physical strength, the level of their technology, and the farming cattle and farm tools should be appropriately matched, so that each production team has a certain number of key members, can form a team, and can pick up and do general farm work. Moreover, once the labor force, land, and farm tools are fixed, they should not be changed easily, in order to implement the production responsibility system and give full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the production team.

	III. We must strengthen the production responsibility system

Establishing and improving the production responsibility system, giving full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of commune members, and improving labor efficiency are the central links in doing a good job in production management. According to the experience of Shucha Commune, to do a good job in the production responsibility system, we must grasp three points:

	First, establish a production responsibility system at all levels. After the people's commune implemented the three-level management system based on the brigade, the responsibility of the production brigade has been greatly strengthened, and the enthusiasm for production has been greatly improved. At present, the main task is to further establish and strengthen the responsibility system of the production team and the production team, and more fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the production team and the production team. According to the survey in Shucha Commune, the main method of strengthening the responsibility system of the production team is to resolutely implement the policy of "three guarantees and one reward." The center of the "three guarantees" is the contract output. The contract output should be positive and reliable, and there should be room for surplus so that the production team can have a surplus. In the autumn of the first year, when formulating the production plan for the second year, they put forward a three-guarantee plan, and before the spring sowing of the second year, they inspected and revised it according to the situation; before the summer harvest and autumn harvest, they respectively estimated the output and implemented it; at the final verification of the annual distribution and settlement, the final verification was carried out. Because their contract output indicators have been repeatedly revised to ensure that the contract output is reasonable, implemented, and rooted, it has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the production team, and the vast majority of production teams can be rewarded for surplus production, so that the production plan can be completed and overfulfilled.

Establishing and strengthening the responsibility system of the production team is the basis for ensuring the smooth implementation of the responsibility system of the production team. Most of the production teams in Shucha Commune often adopt the three-fixed method for production teams throughout the year: setting production targets, setting planting plans, and setting technical measures; small-scale operations adopt the four-guarantee method of guaranteeing farm work tasks, guaranteeing quality, guaranteeing time, and guaranteeing work points. In this way, the production team has a clear goal for the annual production task and measures to complete the production task, and also has specific task requirements for the production in each period, so that the team's responsibility is strengthened, the work is more active, and the roots of the production team's "three guarantees" are also deeper.

The labor responsibility system of the commune members must also be strengthened in the same way. Shucha Commune generally adopts two fixes for the commune members throughout the year: fixing attendance and fixing base points; before going to the field to work every day, it is necessary to make three clarifications: the farm work task is clear, the quality is clear, and the work points are clear. After the farm work is completed, the work points are assessed according to the quantity and quality of each commune member's labor, and work tickets are issued. Under normal circumstances, after the commune members complete the day's farm work, no additional tasks are added, so that there is both labor and rest, and the broad masses of commune members are very welcome to this approach.

	Second, inspect and accept, and implement it throughout. The organizations at all levels of the Shucha Commune can generally earnestly implement the production responsibility system. According to the investigation in the Jinxing Brigade of Gougukou, the brigade inspects the implementation of the production responsibility system while inspecting production. The production team inspects the production team, and the production team inspects the commune members. Each time a task is guaranteed, there is inspection, acceptance after completion, and comparison in acceptance, so that good and bad are distinguished, and rewards and punishments are clear. It is absolutely necessary to strictly implement the production responsibility system, and it is also welcomed by the masses. Because only by doing so can production be done well, so that the lives of the commune members can be continuously improved, and they can better support national construction.

	Third, clarify powers and responsibilities, and both unify and release. After the production team and the production team establish the production responsibility system, they must have corresponding powers to ensure the realization of the responsibility system. After joint discussions by the commune and team cadres, Shucha Commune stipulated the "four unifications and four powers" method for the powers and responsibilities of the production team and the production team. "Four unifications" means: the commune and the production brigade unifies the planting plans for various crops, unifies technical measures for increasing production, unifies the use of water in larger water systems, and unifies labor and animal power cooperation. The four powers are: the production team and the production team have the power to arrange stubble in accordance with local conditions, the power to expand the planting area, the power to arrange the specific implementation of production increase measures, and the production team has the power to arrange small-scale farm work tasks, and the production team has the power to specifically arrange the work tasks for each day. After the powers and responsibilities of each level were clarified, not only was the enthusiasm for production of organizations at all levels mobilized, but also some specific affairs of the production brigade and production team were reduced, so that they could concentrate on solving key problems in production.

    加强生产管理　促进粮食增产
    ——舒茶人民公社生产管理情况的调查	中共安徽省六安地委会	中共安徽省舒城县委会调查组
    舒城县舒茶人民公社经过不断地整顿、巩固和改进经营
  管理制度，已经迅速地走上了健全发展的道路，大大促进了农业生产的发展。其中尤以粮食生产发展最快，1959年全社粮食总产量比1958年增长24％。今年小麦总产量又比1959年增长28％，早稻总产量增长34％。两年来粮食生产一跃再跃，使这个历史上的缺粮区迅速变为余粮区。1959年全社共出售余粮一千一百二十六万斤；今年截至8月止，又出售余粮一千零六十四万斤。茶叶生产也同样获得了增产。1959年全社茶叶总产量比1958年增长11％，今年的总产量又比1959年增长30％。其它如林牧副渔工等多种经营，也都有相应的发展。
    舒茶公社两年来的巨大成绩证明：人民公社这种新的生产关系是适合我国农村生产力发展的需要的。但是，人民公社只有两年的历史，在经营管理等方面，还不能说已达到尽善尽美的境地，还必须有一个不断改进提高的过程，才能形成一套完整的规章制度和先进的经营方法。而要提高人民公社的经营管理水平，需要抓很多环节，其中重要的一环是生产管理。根据舒茶公社的经验，搞好生产管理，必须认真地解决以下三个问题：
      一、贯彻以粮为纲，全面发展、多种经营的方针
    贯彻“以粮为纲”，全面发展、多种经营的方针，是搞好生产管理，促进生产发展的重要一环。根据舒茶公社的经验，就是要把“以粮为纲”的方针贯彻到整个生产管理过程中去，并在这一方针指导下，订好生产计划，根据国家需要和社员生活需要，因地制宜地安排粮食和经济作物的种植比例，以及生产投资的比例。舒茶公社两年来采取三季连作、扩大间种、套种、提高复种指数、大力开荒和扩大耕地面积等办法，使粮食作物种植面积大大增加，经济作物面积也有扩大。1959年粮食播种面积十一万五千七百五十四亩，占总播种面积94％，比1958年扩大三万四千亩。今年播种粮食面积达十七万零七百四十七亩，又比1959年扩大五万四千九百九十三亩。同时，采取河沙滩种花生，大开生荒种芝麻，庄前宅后种黄麻，道路两旁栽蓖麻，见缝扎针种葵花等等办法，使多种经济作物播种面积达一万四千零八十亩，比去年扩大30.5％。这样作，既扩大了粮食作物的种植面积，也增加了多种经济作物的种植面积。为了提高粮食单位面积产量，舒茶公社还适当地增加了粮食作物的工本费用，在“三包”中，每亩粮食耕地面积增加四个工，增加了一元八角的费用。这就从物质力量上保证了粮食作物的精耕细作和高产多收。为了提高广大社员生产粮食的积极性，对于超过粮食包产的生产队，从超产粮食中提取10％—20％用于奖励。对于粮食生产和多种经营生产的劳动报酬，要合理评定，做到大致平衡，使从事粮食生产和从事多种经营的社员都能充分发挥主动性和积极性。
      二、以农业为中心，粮食为重点，合理使用劳力
    人民公社的成立，解放了大批劳动力，为充分动员和合理使用劳动力创造了有利的条件，但同时也带来了一些新的问题。公社经营范围广，生产项目多，农林牧副渔工和生活福利事业都要人。在这种新的情况下，如何保证以农业为中心，以粮食为重点，合理使用劳动力，是生产管理工作中的一项重要问题。由于舒茶公社是个产茶地区，茶叶生产的季节性很强，而又集中在春播春种期间，因而如何合理地安排和使用劳动力，既能突出地保证重点，把主要的劳动力使用到农业生产、特别是粮食生产上，又能照顾一般，使茶叶以及其他生产也能得到相应的发展，就显得更加重要。舒茶人民公社是这样作的：
      第一，采取革命措施，把一切可以利用的劳动力利用起来，加强农业战线
    舒茶公社建立初期，有的人没有全面地理解人民公社的生产方针，错误地认为：人民公社是六业并举，劳动力应当平均分配，因而有的地方劳动力的使用不够集中。固定在农业上的劳动力，一度只占劳动力总数的64％。公社党委及时地检查和批判了上述倾向，在1959年和1960年春天，结合整社，对劳动组织进行了两次大规模的整顿。全社先后共调集四千二百四十一个劳动力投入农业生产，其中80％以上的人分配到重点粮产区，参加粮食生产。这样，就使今年全社固定在农业生产上的劳动力达劳动力总数的82％，而且其中强劳力占88％以上；在农业生产用工中，粮食生产用工占94.6％，首先保证了粮食的生产。但是根据调查，舒茶公社个别环节在劳动力的使用上也还有不合理的现象，主要是畜牧场、农业机械厂等企业的定额管理较差，用人较多，里面仍大有潜力可挖。最近他们对劳动力使用情况又进一步作了检查和改进，从各方面抽出劳动力投入了田间生产，使参加农业生产的劳动力又由占劳力总数82％增加到90％。
    由于舒茶公社调整劳动组织，不是采取单纯地裁减人员的办法，而是主要从挖掘劳动潜力，改善经营管理和提高劳动效率等积极的方面着眼，其结果是农业战线加强了，其他事业也有了发展。公社的绿茶初制厂就是一个例子。这个厂，今年春天开展了“增产不增人，增产又减人”的运动，实行定员定额管理，大闹技术革新，提高劳动生产率，在抽调二十九个工人支援农业生产以后，产量仍然比去年增加42％。
        第二，按照农事忙闲灵活调度劳动力
    为了充分合理地使用农村劳动力，在各个方面的劳动力基本固定下来以后，还应当从有利于农业生产的前提出发，按照农事忙闲，灵活调度劳动力。根据舒茶公社的经验，主要应从以下三个方面进行：
    一是以农业生产为主，灵活调度社办工业和林牧副渔等多种经营的劳动力。舒茶公社除农业机械制造厂维持常年生产以外，一般社办工厂（场）企业都和农业生产季节相结合，农闲多办，农忙少办，大忙停办，农忙务农，农闲务工。如去年就利用冬闲办了野生植物综合利用加工厂、纸厂、砖瓦厂等九个工厂，为公社创造了十二万五千元财富。今年春耕生产开始时，这些工厂就暂时停工，工人都回乡参加农业生产。在今年抢收早稻、抢栽晚稻的季节，公社党委为了确保“双抢”全胜，又让饲料加工厂、食品加工厂等八个厂暂时停工，二百五十三个职工全部投入“双抢”。畜牧场和园艺场等，也只留下几个年老的饲养员、林业员坚持工作，其他人员全部投入农业生产。这样，在“双抢”紧张时期，全社投入“双抢”的劳动力几乎达到百分之百，从而保证了“双抢”任务能够按时、按量、按质完成。这个公社在调度劳动力中，还特别注意采用统一调度、协作生产的办法，解决粮茶生产的矛盾。去年冬闲时期，就从山外抽调二千多个强劳动力上山挖茶园。今年采摘春茶和春播挤在一起，公社党委就从山外抽调二千五百多个辅助劳动力上山采茶，替换出山里的二千多个强劳动力到山外帮助抢栽早稻，从而及时地完成了抢栽和采摘任务，做到了粮茶生产两不误。
    二是以粮食作物为主，灵活调度多种经济作物的用工。舒茶公社在粮食生产的关键时期，如收、种季节，对各种经济作物用工，采取能提前的提前，能推后的推后等办法，错开农活，以保证用优势兵力抓好粮食生产。
    三是以当前田间生产为主，合理安排兴修水利等农业基本建设工作。两年来，舒茶公社的农田基本建设，都是利用冬闲时期进行的，而且是同冬季各项田间生产，越冬作物特别是粮食作物田间管理和冬季积肥运动等统一安排的。到了春季农忙时期，用在水利等基本建设上的劳动力，就立即转入春耕大生产，没有因为搞农田基本建设而削弱了农业生产。
              第三，合理安排农活
    合理安排农活，是一项十分细致复杂的工作，对提高劳动效率的关系很大。现在，舒茶公社的社队干部，一般都掌握了看人、看活、看天时、看活茬、看农具的“五看”方法，巧妙地安排农活，因而大大地提高了劳动效率，克服了窝工和浪费工的现象。他们是怎样掌握“五看”方法的呢？根据在过湾、山埠等生产队的调查，主要是：一、依靠社员安排农活。广大社员，特别是老农对本队本组哪些活要干，哪些活该先干或后干，哪些活茬该派多少人、应派什么人，是最清楚不过的。只有听取群众意见，农活才能安排得合理。如今年7月份，过湾生产队的一百多亩玉米锄了一遍以后，干部打算安排全部劳力积肥，而老社员王朝段却提出安排一些劳力，赶晴天把玉米再刨（复锄）一遍。这样，不仅刨的快，一工顶三工，而且一遍抵三遍。队长接受了这个意见，安排了四十多个劳力，两天就把这些玉米刨完了，不但节省了八十个劳动日，而且由于复锄及时，以后这一片地就没有长什么草。这个队的干部从亲身的体验中得出一个结论：“安排农活五看还要加一‘听’，听社员的意见。”二、对农活进行勤排队短安排。“五看”的关键是看人、看活。看人比较容易，因为生产队组的干部和社员都是在一块长大的，对每个社员的特长非常清楚。而农活却天天在变化，就不那么容易掌握了。因此，必须不断地对各个时期应做的农活进行细致的排队，作到心中有数，实行长计划、短安排，才能合理派工，使用得当。三、又干又转。生产队组的干部除应当和社员一同劳动以外，每天还应当抽出一定的时间到本队组的生产范围内转转，了解全面情况，便于看活派人。过湾等生产队的队长一般是在每一段农活安排以后，就到四周转一趟，看各组的行动情况；在这段农活的中间又转一趟，检查各组完成任务的情况。生产组长则根据情况或早或晚，每天转一趟，及时掌握生产的变化。这样，农活就能看得更准确，派工也就更合理。
              第四，组织生产小组
    公社化以后，生产队的规模扩大了，这是适应生产发展的需要的。但是，从舒茶公社来看，在生产队下面还应当设立生产小组。因为一般的生产队都有二百多个劳动力，有二、三公里范围，有千亩左右的土地，如果不划分生产小组，就难免发生农活安排不周、劳力使用不当等窝工浪费现象。根据舒茶公社的经验，在划分生产小组时，除应注意每个小组的劳动力不宜过多过少以外，对于社员觉悟程度的高低、体力强弱和技术高低以及耕畜和农具等都要作适当的搭配，使每个生产小组都有一定数量的骨干分子，能够形成一套班子，对一般农活能够拿得起、干得开。而且劳力、土地、农具等一经固定下来，就不要轻易变动，以利贯彻生产责任制，充分发挥生产小组的积极性和主动性。
      三、必须加强生产责任制
    建立和健全生产责任制，充分发挥社员的积极性、主动性，提高劳动效率，这是搞好生产管理的中心环节。根据舒茶公社的经验，搞好生产责任制，必须抓住三条：
    第一，层层建立生产责任制。人民公社贯彻了以大队为基础的三级管理制以后，生产大队的责任已大大加强，生产积极性大大提高。目前主要是要进一步建立和加强生产队和生产小组的责任制，更充分地调动生产队、生产组的积极性。根据在舒茶公社的调查，加强生产队责任制的办法主要是坚决贯彻执行“三包一奖”的政策。“三包”的中心是包产。包产要积极可靠，而且要留有余地，使生产队有产可超。他们在头一年秋天，结合制订第二年的生产计划时，就提出三包方案，到第二年春播前，又根据情况进行检查修订；在夏收秋收前分别进行估产落实；在全年分配决算时，最后核实。由于他们的包产指标经过反复修订，作到包产合理、落实、生根，因而极大地鼓舞了生产队的积极性，绝大多数生产队都能因为超产而受奖，使生产计划能够完成和超额完成。
    建立与加强生产组的责任制，是保证生产队责任制顺利贯彻的基础。舒茶公社大部分生产队，对生产组常年采取定生产指标、定种植计划、定技术措施的三定办法；小段作业则采取包农活任务、包质量、包时间、包工分的四包办法。这样，生产组对全年生产任务，完成生产任务的措施，就有了明确的奋斗目标，对每个时期的生产也有了具体的任务要求，从而使小组的责任加强了，工作主动了，生产队“三包”的根子也扎得更深了。
    社员的劳动责任制，也必须同样加强。舒茶公社一般采取对社员常年实行两定：即定出勤、定底分；在每天下田干活之前，做到三明：即农活任务明、质量明、工分明。农活完成之后，根据每个社员劳动的数量和质量，对照劳动定额，评定工分，发给工票。在一般情况下，社员完成一天的农活之后，不再加码，做到有劳有逸，广大社员对这种作法非常欢迎。
    第二，检查验收，贯彻始终。舒茶公社的各级组织，对生产责任制一般都能认真地贯彻执行。根据在沟沟口金星大队调查，大队在检查生产的同时，也检查生产责任制贯彻执行的情况。生产队对生产组，生产组对社员，每包一项任务，都有检查，干完验收，验中有比，做到好坏分清，奖惩分明。这样严格地执行生产责任制是完全必要的，也是为群众所欢迎的。因为只有这样作，才能搞好生产，使社员的生活能够不断改善，又可以更好地支援国家建设。
    第三，明确职权，又统又放。生产队、生产小组建立生产责任制以后，都必须有相应的权力，保证责任制的实现。舒茶公社对生产队、生产小组的职权问题，经过社、队干部共同讨论，规定了“四统四权”的办法。“四统”即：公社和生产大队一统各种作物种植计划，二统增产技术措施，三统较大水系用水，四统劳畜力协作。四权是：生产队和生产小组，一有权因地制宜安排茬口，二有权扩大种植面积，三有权安排增产措施的具体贯彻，四是生产队有权安排小段农活任务，生产小组有权具体安排每天的活路。各级职权明确以后，不仅调动了各级组织的生产积极性，而且减少了生产大队、生产队的一些具体事务，使他们能集中精力解决生产上的关键问题。
