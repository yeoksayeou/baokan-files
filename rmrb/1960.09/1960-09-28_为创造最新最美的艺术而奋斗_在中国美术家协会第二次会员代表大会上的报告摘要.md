    Striving to Create the Newest and Most Beautiful Art
    ——Excerpts from a Report at the Second Congress of Members of the Chinese Artists Association

　　Encouraged by the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and guided by the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the policies of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and "Weeding through the old to bring forth the new," the cause of art creation has developed even more than before the Second Congress of Literary and Art Workers. The ranks of artists have greatly expanded, the relationship between art and the working people has become closer, and the ideological and artistic levels of art creation have significantly improved. The themes and content of creation have become richer and more diverse, especially in achieving excellent results in portraying the new spiritual outlook of the working people. Forms and styles have also undergone creative development, with Chinese spirit and national characteristics becoming increasingly distinct. Art creation not only presents unprecedented prosperity but has also become an inseparable part of our people's cultural life. This tremendous achievement can be seen in a general outline from the following specific circumstances.

    First, art has achieved close integration with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The popularization of art among the working people is deepening and expanding daily, producing a positive impact and role in the spiritual lives of the broad masses.

    New Year pictures, comic strips, and propaganda posters are the most widely popularized works of art among the masses. These works mostly depict the ever-changing lives and struggles of the working people, expressing their life aspirations and revolutionary ideals, which meet the appreciation needs of the broad masses. Therefore, in recent years, there has been a greater development in the number of publications. The achievements of these kinds of artworks are, of course, not only reflected in quantity; the increase in the number of prints is related to the improvement of the quality of the works. In terms of New Year pictures, in addition to timely portraying the great leap forward in production and the new atmosphere of life of the workers and peasants, the artistic style is also more suitable for the tastes of the working people. For example, New Year pictures published in Shanghai, Shandong, Shaanxi, Hubei, Guangdong, and other provinces and cities in recent years have not only promoted the excellent traditions of New Year pictures but also promoted the original characteristics of New Year pictures in different regions, winning the universal love of the masses. There are also many good works in comic strip creation, such as "Child Laborer," "I Want to Study," "Reconnaissance Across the River," "The Great Change of Feldspar," "Wrath of Miaoshan," etc., all of which have won praise from the broad masses. Many excellent young authors have emerged in comic strip creation, and the achievements of comic strips cannot be separated from their hard work. Propaganda posters in Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin have higher artistic quality and are more closely coordinated with the publicity of mass movements; the "People's Commune is Good" wall chart published in Tianjin is warmly welcomed by the masses. Jiang Zhaohe's "Advancing Along the Socialist Road," Ha Qunwen's "Eternal Spring of Sino-Soviet Friendship," Qian Daxin's "Strive for Greater Harvest, Dedicate to Socialism," Yang Wenxiu's "More Pigs, More Fertilizer, Higher Grain Production," and Zhang Ruji's "Armed Intervention Cannot Scare People Who Strive for Independence" are all good works that have played a positive role in propaganda and mobilization. In addition, art slides and local pictorials have also developed greatly in recent years, becoming an indispensable part of the cultural life of workers, peasants, and soldiers and a good tool for uniting and educating the people.

    Secondly, on the other hand, in the close integration of art and the masses, the upsurge of amateur art activities of workers, peasants, and soldiers means that the working people are not only appreciators of art but also creators of art. The art cause has become the common cause of the broad masses of our people.

    Since 1958, with the development of the Great Leap Forward in production, amateur art activities of workers, peasants, and soldiers have also experienced unprecedented development. The military art activities with a longer history have inherited the glorious revolutionary tradition and played a great role in coordinating political propaganda. A large number of works praising the Three Red Banners and reflecting the life of the troops appeared in the 1959 "Military Art Exhibition," "Navy Art Exhibition," "Armored Corps Art Exhibition," and this year's "Second All-Army Art Exhibition," overflowing with patriotism and internationalism, demonstrating the heroic spirit of the people's soldiers. The worker art activities that flourished in the early days of liberation, especially cartoon creation activities, have played an active role in adhering to serving production and adhering to the self-education of the working class. The factory history paintings that began to appear in Tianjin and other places in 1958 are an important development in worker art creation, which is of great help to further improving the class consciousness of the working masses. With the wide development of worker art creation, the themes, forms, and styles of creation have gradually become diversified. For example, the works in the National Railway Workers Art Exhibition held in Beijing recently are a good illustration. The rural wall painting movement that first started in Pixian County, Jiangsu, Shulu and Zunhua in Hebei, Fuyang in Anhui, and Qingyang in Gansu in 1958, as well as the worker-peasant prints activities in Zhanjiang, Guangdong, later gradually formed a nationwide upsurge of rural art creation. Like the art creation of soldiers and workers, the works of peasants have played a huge role in publicizing the General Line and promoting the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune movement. Mass art realistically expresses the lofty ideals of communism and revolutionary enthusiasm, with a strong spirit of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. The upsurge of mass art activities of workers, peasants, and soldiers has added fresh blood to art creation and opened a new era in the history of Chinese art. It is unprecedented for art to become a cause mastered by the broad masses themselves. This is a major victory of the cultural revolution and a major victory for the worker-peasant-soldier orientation of literature and art.

    Arts and crafts are connected with the practical life of the broad masses of the people. They include the widest categories and develop the fastest. Whether in ceramics, dyeing and weaving, carving, embroidery, architectural decoration, book design, etc., art design and production technology have been significantly improved. Since the Great Leap Forward, arts and crafts have been further developed; folk artists, arts and crafts artists, and technicians of various ethnic groups and regions have displayed a high degree of creativity and cooperation, implemented the policy of "Weeding through the old to bring forth the new" in production and manufacturing, and created countless new products with national styles and local colors, presenting a scene of a hundred flowers blooming. The architectural decoration and interior design of the Great Hall of the People, as well as the National Arts and Crafts Exhibition held in Beijing last year, are a concentrated manifestation of the Great Leap Forward in our country's arts and crafts cause. The excellent achievements of arts and crafts are mainly due to the promotion of the excellent national traditions and the combination of the strong Chinese spirit and the novel era style, so they have won unanimous praise.

    Chinese painting creation has also achieved new achievements in the inheritance and innovation of national traditions. The painters have reached a proficient level in using traditional brush and ink to describe new real life; it is not only rich in national characteristics but also vividly expresses new ideological content. "The Country So Rich in Beauty" (Fu Baoshi, Guan Shanyue), which depicts the magnificent mountains and rivers of the motherland, "Moving Mountains and Filling Valleys" (Li Shuoqing) and "World-Renowned Innovation" (collective creation of the Art Training Department of Shandong Art Institute), which depict the laboring people conquering nature, have been universally praised by the masses. Other examples include "High Pine Tree" (He Xiangning), "Spring Splendor" (Pan Tianshou), "Peonies and White Doves" (posthumous work of Yu Feian), "The River Will Clear" (He Tianjian), "Fighting for Steel" (collective creation of Jiangsu Chinese Painting Academy), "Song of Labor" (Huang Zhou), "Delivering Meals on a Snowy Night" (Yang Zhiguang), "People's Commune is Good" (Shao Yu), "Cable Workers Tackling Cutting-Edge Technology" (collective creation of the Chinese Painting Department of Luxun Academy of Fine Arts), and "Every Grain is Hard-Earned" (Fang Zengxian), which are all good works. It should also be pointed out that many prestigious Chinese painters in our country, some of whom are old, are still diligently painting, some are devoted to sorting out painting theories and innovating techniques, some are passing on creative experience to younger generations, and some are going to factories and rural areas to participate in labor and guide amateur art creation by the masses. This hard work shows their high enthusiasm for protecting the socialist art cause. Although there are still some shortcomings in art creation and it cannot meet the growing demands of the broad masses, the creative path we have experienced is the most correct and broadest path. As long as we follow the Party's direction and policies for literature and art, we will surely achieve greater achievements. The Party's leadership guarantees the victory of the art cause. The achievements we have already made are the victory of the orientation of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the victory of the literary and art policies of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and "Weeding through the old to bring forth the new." In the final analysis, it is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

    II

    Serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers with literature and art is the direction pointed out to us literary and art workers by Comrade Mao Zedong eighteen years ago. Under the guidance of this direction, our art creation has also undergone fundamental changes. Art that used to serve a few people has been returned to the hands of the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving the interests of the revolution, serving the needs of the masses, and serving the socialist cause. This is a great revolution in art, opening a new era in the history of Chinese art.

    Since workers, peasants, and soldiers are the service objects of art, they cannot but be the objects of art's expression. To realistically and profoundly express workers, peasants, and soldiers through plastic arts, to express their new life and revolutionary struggle, is a new work, a work of great significance. Following the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, our country's artists actively integrated with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, gradually changed their old world outlook and artistic outlook, and through continuous creative practice, obtained some basic experience and achieved great achievements. Now, looking back, how does our art serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers? How does it express the workers, peasants, and soldiers? What are the differences between it and the art that served a few people in the past? What role and influence has it played among the broad masses? To clarify these questions, answers can only be found in the artworks.

    Judging from our artworks of the past ten years, the creative themes are very characteristic. The first obvious feature is that they reflect the revolutionary movements and revolutionary wars of the workers, peasants, and soldiers; they express the revolutionary heroic figures and their steadfast qualities. In the past, the working masses did not get their due status in artworks, and the revolutionary struggles of the working masses rarely appeared in artworks. Now, in our artworks, this situation has completely changed. Although the revolutionary themes adopted by the authors are different and the expressive techniques are also different, they have a common center of depiction, which is to express the firm image, the brave image, and the image of the victors of the revolutionaries. The revolutionary optimism of the people's soldiers depicted in "Hard Years" is precisely the common spirit of the working masses in our country when the revolution suffered setbacks. The heroic image of unyielding to death depicted in "Five Heroes of Langya Mountain" also expresses the spiritual strength of our people in winning the victory of the War of Resistance. "Blood-Stained Clothes" and "Speaking Bitterness" depict the fighting spirit of the awakened peasants. The solemn and majestic "Contemporary Heroes" is a picture depicting the Party leaders leading the people to victory. In other paintings and sculptures, what the authors deliberately depict is precisely the tenacious fighting spirit and unwavering confidence in victory of the revolutionary heroic figures. At the same time, it is also combined with love for the revolutionary leaders. This not only correctly reflects the revolutionary will of the working masses in our country but also correctly reflects the spirit of our era of great revolutionary development. From these works, we can see the path of the working masses liberating themselves, and we can see that revolutionary struggle is the master that determines the fate of mankind; it inspires revolutionary consciousness, enhances combat strength, and encourages the revolution to continue to move forward. This is the role of the art that expresses revolutionary struggle, and it is also the reason why these works have won the trust, love, and support of the broad masses.

    Another feature in our artworks is that they reflect the new labor spirit of the workers, peasants, and soldiers; they express the powerful force of the laboring people building socialism, and they express the magnificent picture of the Great Leap Forward in production. In the old days, when the working masses were still under the rule of the exploiting classes, labor was always linked to employment, enslavement, and the suffering of life. Only in a socialist country where the working masses have overthrown the rule of the exploiting classes and become the masters of their own affairs can the enthusiasm and creativity of labor be highly developed, creating endless beautiful scenery in socialist production and construction. The image of the female worker in "Female Power Distribution Worker," the image of the worker in "Cable Workers Tackling Cutting-Edge Technology," and the image of the laboring masses in "World-Renowned Innovation" all clearly depict this new spiritual outlook. In other works, the authors have depicted the joy and solemnity of our labor life from different perspectives; the joy of the harvest in "Winter Melon on High-Rise Buildings" and the collective singing of the peasants in "Song of Labor" all depict the victory song of the Great Leap Forward in production. "General's Field" expresses the noble qualities of our revolutionary generals who love labor. "At the Third Watch" expresses the high labor enthusiasm of the members of the People's Commune. "Moving Mountains and Filling Valleys" more strongly expresses the infinite power displayed by the laboring people in conquering nature. And "Shaanxi-North Jiangsu" and "Inside and Outside the Great Wall" depict the magnificent picture of nature that has been transformed. From these many works, we can see how different socialist labor is from the past. We can see the ambition of our people to change the face of the motherland, and we can see the powerful force of the working masses building socialism. These works are inspiring, inspiring, and arouse people's enthusiasm for loving labor and loving the motherland, playing a positive role and influence among the broad masses.

    In our artworks, there is another feature, which is that it expresses the new atmosphere of the life of the laboring people, expresses the new relationship between people based on socialist ideology, and expresses the new thoughts, new morality, and new qualities of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Jiang Yan's "Testing Mom" brilliantly reflects the determination of working women to learn culture, and at the same time, it portrays the excellent qualities of the working people from the mother who asks her daughter for advice. Hu Tilin's "Orphan" is a scene of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea in which soldiers are sewing clothes for wandering orphans, fully expressing the class friendship and internationalist spirit of our people's soldiers. Cai Liang's "Lodging" vividly expresses the deep affection of the Tibetan people for the state cadres through a scene of geological workers lodging in the homes of the Tibetan people, and it also reflects the class feelings of the laboring people. Yang Zhiguang's "Delivering Meals on a Snowy Night" expresses the mutual cooperation of the laboring people and the noble qualities of not being afraid of hardship and difficulties. Niu Wen's "The East is Red, the Sun Rises," Huang Zhou's "Outpatient Service," Shao Yu's "Sketches of the Capital," Yu Yuechuan's "Reading at Night," and many other works are all depictions of the new atmosphere of life, and they all focus on expressing the new thoughts, new morality, and new qualities of the laboring people. It can be seen here that the emergence of these new things is the newest and most beautiful flower cultivated in the socialist ideological garden, a very valuable spiritual wealth, and a clear sign that the advanced working-class ideology has defeated the old ideology and old habits. Our art expresses these new things, and it will definitely promote the growth and general development of new things. From these works, we can see the pace of the times moving forward, and we can see the beautiful future of life. It guides people's spirit upward and life upward, it fills people with confidence in the revolution, and it encourages people to move towards the great goal of communism.

    The content of our art creation is very rich. The above is just a few common themes in the works, which are the main aspects of expressing the life and struggle of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Leaving these themes, it is impossible to show the true face of life. Leaving these themes, it is impossible to play a huge role in serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Our artists have opened up such a correct creative path under the leadership of the Party, which should be a source of pride.

    However, modern revisionists have completely different views. They believe that socialist art is already "outdated" and that only abstract art is the freshest thing in the world. They tout "realism," but they oppose writing about the reality of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They believe that art should not have any purpose of propaganda and education, but they greatly praise bourgeois art, as if bourgeois art is without any purpose. Combining these views of the revisionists, it is not difficult to understand that their saying that socialist art is already "outdated" means asking all progressive art to retreat to the old path of bourgeois art. The "reality" they are talking about refers to the garbage in the "inner world" of the bourgeoisie. They oppose the purpose of propaganda and education in art, but only oppose the purpose of art for revolutionary propaganda and educating the people, and do not oppose the purpose of art deceiving the people, paralyzing the people, and propagandizing reactionary ideas. This is the real intention of modern revisionists.

    Under the political direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, the Party has also put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and "Weeding through the old to bring forth the new." This is a policy to promote artistic development and scientific progress, and it is a policy to promote the prosperity of our country's socialist culture. This policy has been warmly supported by art workers throughout the country, and they have worked hard to implement it in their creative practice. Facts have proved that the rapid development of the art cause and the increasing prosperity of creation, and the love and support of the broad masses for artworks, are the result of implementing this correct policy.

    The specific content of implementing this policy in art work is the inheritance and innovation of national art traditions, the free use of different themes and genres, the free development of different forms and styles, the combination of foreign forms and national characteristics, the combination of popularization and improvement, and the unity of the consistency of political direction and the diversity of artistic styles is the common principle of implementing this policy.

    In the inheritance and innovation of national art traditions, we started with folk art that has a close relationship with the broad masses.

    To transform folk art, to give folk art, which was originally understood and loved by the laboring people, new ideological content and make it suitable for the needs of today's laboring people, is the primary task of popularizing art among the broad masses. The transformation of New Year pictures and comic strips is a concrete example.

    New Year pictures in our country are the most widely circulated and deeply influential folk art among the broad masses of peasants. The content of New Year pictures is always nothing more than a good harvest of crops, prosperity of livestock, and stories of heroic figures; this reflects the simple life ideals of the peasants in our country, and New Year pictures are a portrayal of the ideals of the peasants in our country. New Year pictures have unique symbolic techniques and decorative meaning in terms of expressive techniques, which cannot be separated from the romantic spirit in content. When we transform New Year pictures, we do not abandon these advantages, but use new life content and ideological content to enrich and promote these advantages. The transformed New Year pictures are actually pictures that express the working masses realizing new ideals in the practice of labor and struggle. These new New Year pictures have not only won the warm praise of the peasant masses but have also been welcomed by all the working people, and they have produced a positive role in the spiritual life of the people.

    Comic strips are also one of the most widely spread folk arts in our country. The ideological content of past comic strips was very unhealthy, and the pictures were also very crude, which was of no benefit to the laboring people. Therefore, when we transform comic strips, we first change the reactionary, backward, and outdated content of comic strips, select literary works that are of educational significance to the laboring masses, adapt and create new comic strips, and improve the artistic level on this basis. The script writing work of comic strips is the main key to embodying the ideological content of the works and giving play to the expressive ability of art. All comic strips that have won the praise of the masses do not simply explain the story process, but focus on expressing the theme of the works through the depiction of characters' actions; the script writing work plays a decisive role here. At present, comic strips have become the most favorite reading material of the laboring people. Only by constantly improving the ideological level and artistic level can we meet the growing needs of the broad masses.

    The innovation of folk art is an important way for socialist art to closely connect with the masses. Ten years of work have proved that the road of combining popularization and improvement is a correct road for implementing the Party's literary and art policy.

    Secondly, we have adopted the themes and genres of our country's traditional art, expressing the new features of life and ideological features from various angles, so as to meet the diverse appreciation requirements of the broad masses of the laboring people and cadres.

    Traditional art in our country is classified according to the scope of themes such as figures, landscapes, and flowers and birds. In figure painting, portrait painting occupies a large proportion. In the feudal era, the field of portrait painting was completely occupied by figures such as emperors, nobles, landlords, and bureaucrats; it was difficult for laborers who created social wealth to gain a place in portrait painting. This unreasonable phenomenon continued for more than two thousand years. Only after the working people became the masters of the country did the laborers become the masters of portrait painting. In our new portrait paintings, there are ordinary workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as heroic models on the labor front, meritorious servants and leaders of the laboring people. The portrait works of painters Wu Zuoren, Wang Shikuo, Luo Gongliu, Dong Xiwen, Jiang Zhaohe, Li Hu, Zhang Zhenshi, etc., are often well received by the masses. The new portrait painting world has become the Qilin Pavilion of the laboring people, so that the heroic people who have emerged in thousands of ways can be admired forever, so as not to fail our great era of emerging heroes.

    Landscape paintings and flower and bird paintings, which depict natural beauty, have always occupied a large position in the history of art in our country. People appreciate nature and praise nature, often combined with life imagination and association; the characteristics of natural scenery are often regarded as mental mimics of people. People praise the majesty of the mountains, the vastness of the sea, the steadfastness of the pines, and the pride of the cranes, and at the same time they are praising people, praising the spirit of people that is consistent with the characteristics of nature. In landscape paintings and flower and bird paintings, objective beauty and subjective thoughts and feelings are thus integrated. The class colors in the works are often more implicit, tortuous, and weak. However, if we compare the works of different historical periods, we can see that the works that depict natural beauty also reflect the class requirements of an era (in the selection of themes and the attitude towards the objects of description, it is impossible not to include the author's subjective wishes), and the creation of expressing natural beauty cannot transcend class consciousness. The so-called truthfully describing reality, the so-called purely objectively expressing nature, simply does not exist. It is no exception in our new landscape and flower and bird paintings. There are many works that embody the thoughts and feelings of the laboring people through natural beauty, and embody the healthy, rich, and noble spiritual realm of the workers and peasants. When 600 million people are enthusiastically realizing their grand ideals, it is completely in line with the requirements of the broad masses to create newer and more beautiful landscape paintings and flower and bird paintings with a revolutionary romanticism spirit.

    In the inheritance and innovation of national forms and styles, artists have made many explorations in creative practice; critically inheriting, creatively innovating, promoting the general development of new national forms and new styles, and the revolutionary content and perfect forms have gradually become unified.

    The long-standing Chinese art has distinct national characteristics; it depicts life without mechanically imitating life, advocates the likeness of shapes without deviating from the likeness of forms; it particularly emphasizes the means of artistic generalization, emphasizing the expression of artistic conception from a high degree of generalization; it both describes things and expresses emotions, both realism and impressionism; the so-called "learning from nature externally, and gaining the source internally" is to organically combine the authenticity of reflecting objective objects and the subjective initiative of expressing thoughts and feelings. All the forms of expression and expressive techniques are generated from this general principle. With the development of history, the expressive forms and expressive methods of art are also developing along this path, constantly changing, and constantly enriching, and they are by no means immutable. Because the artists first understand the roots of the forms and techniques when they study the traditional forms and expressive techniques, they will not inherit them uncritically, and they can innovate and create on the original basis, so that they can adapt to the new ideological content. In recent years, the remarkable achievements of Chinese painting and printmaking lie in the fact that they do not unconditionally use traditional forms and expressive techniques, and they lie in the fact that they have given play to artistic originality on the basis of inheriting the tradition, so the forms and content of the works have gradually become unified, gradually forming new forms and new styles with national characteristics, presenting a prosperous scene of a hundred flowers blooming and a thousand purples and reds competing for beauty. In terms of sculpture and oil painting, the attempt to integrate foreign forms and national characteristics has achieved initial results, and a new type of national style is forming. Other examples, such as animated films, stage art, and illustrations of literary works, are also working hard to create new national forms, and a large number of original styles have emerged, reaching an unprecedented artistic prosperity. The nationalization and popularization of art cannot be separated. In order to meet the aesthetic tastes of the broad masses, our artists have adhered to the correct principle of promoting the national characteristics of art, and the new flowers of national art have been generally developed, grown, and radiate their brilliance in the socialist soil. This is a new atmosphere in our field of art creation that is worthy of rejoicing and encouragement.

    The above is a brief explanation based on the specific practice of art creation under the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and "Weeding through the old to bring forth the new." From the above specific examples, we can see that the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and "Weeding through the old to bring forth the new" has opened up an incomparably broad road for art creation and opened up a new world for socialist art, proving that the Party's literary and art policy is the most correct policy that can withstand the test of facts.

    Our "Let a hundred flowers bloom" is the "Let a hundred flowers bloom" under the political direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers; our "Weeding through the old to bring forth the new" is the "Weeding through the old to bring forth the new" under the service of the interests and needs of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The unity of the consistency of political direction and the diversity of artistic styles is our unwavering principle. However, modern revisionists and people with bourgeois artistic views distort this principle with various excuses. They distort "Let a hundred flowers bloom" to mean that bourgeois poisonous weeds can legally exist, and they oppose "Weeding through the old to bring forth the new." They one-sidedly emphasize improvement to oppose the popularization of art among the laboring people. They oppose the diversity of art and the consistency of political direction, thereby denying the consistency of political direction. Their purpose in doing so is nothing more than to separate art from the broad masses, nothing more than to replace socialist fragrant flowers with bourgeois poisonous weeds, and nothing more than to cancel the political direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Revisionists and bourgeois artists particularly tout the freedom of artistic creation; this is deception. People who do not recognize objective truth and do not obey objective truth will have no freedom. They only have the "freedom" to obey the money bags of their keepers, the freedom to trade art as a commodity, and the freedom to deceive the people, paralyze the people, and propagandize reactionary ideas with art. The artists in our country who have the advanced ideology of the working class have recognized the law of social development and seen the future of life development, and their brushes can gallop through the universe and depict all things. This is true creative freedom. Our flourishing art of "Let a hundred flowers bloom" eloquently illustrates this truth. Revisionists believe that the popularization of art among the laboring people is to pander to the masses; they say that although the laboring people do not understand abstractism now, they will definitely accept it in the future. This exposes their hypocrisy again. The laboring people will never want their "art" that insults mankind and is rotten to the core. As for the future, the laboring people have an infinitely wonderful future, and socialist art also has a bright future. Only modern revisionists who peddle bourgeois private goods will never have a future; this is destined by history.

    III

    Comrades, we are in an era when the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and colonialism is unprecedentedly high, and we are in an era when the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong and the socialist cause is constantly victorious. Our artists, like the warriors on all ideological fronts, in order to improve the people's socialist communist ideological consciousness and moral qualities, in order to inspire the people's revolutionary will and labor enthusiasm, in order to beautify the motherland and enrich the people's spiritual life, we must unswervingly follow the leadership of the Party and pay greater strength in the art cause and strive for new and greater victories. What are our tasks in the future?

    First, we must further develop creation under the political direction of adhering to serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving socialism and the literary and art policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and "Weeding through the old to bring forth the new," and create more and better works. This is the fundamental task of all our artists. The popularization of art among the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers is still in the primary position of creation. We must constantly improve the ideological level and artistic level of creation on the existing basis of art popularization work in order to meet the growing aesthetic requirements of the masses. We should also continue to carry out amateur art activities of workers, peasants, and soldiers, guide mass creation, and promote mass amateur art creation to greater prosperity. With the wide development of socialist cultural construction, the need for painting, printmaking, sculpture, and arts and crafts is increasing day by day. We must strengthen creative practice, critically inherit the heritage, improve the expressive skills of plastic arts, so that the correct ideological content and the beautiful artistic form can achieve a perfect combination, so that the creative purpose of educating the people and the corresponding artistic means can be consistent, so as to create works with Chinese style, profound ideological content, and artistic appeal. In addition, we should also strengthen the weak links in art creation, especially children's art reading materials, which play a major role in children's ideological education; we must vigorously develop art works suitable for children's reading, and closely combine the cultivation of aesthetic ability with communist education, so that the successors of building socialism can grow up healthily in aesthetic education. This is the most glorious and unshrinkable responsibility of our artists.

    Second, the development of art creation cannot be separated from the development of art theory; neglecting art theory will be detrimental to the healthy development of creation. Our art theory work must be closely linked to reality, must be combined with eradicating the influence of modern revisionist ideology and fighting against various bourgeois artistic tendencies, and oppose empty talk that is divorced from ideological struggle and does not help improve the level of creation and the level of appreciation. Our art theory work should be based on promoting the development of creation, carrying out commentary on works; summarizing creative experience, studying the excellent traditions of our country's art, and exploring the artistic methods of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism are the focus of theoretical construction in our art field. Especially in the aspect of commentary on works, we must resolutely implement the principle of putting political standards first, and at the same time we should distinguish between the basic tendency and local problems of the works, and oppose crude criticism that does not go through specific artistic analysis. We should encourage artistic originality and the diversity of styles in many ways, and we should especially support the emerging forces in creation, so that the commentary on works can not only become a powerful tool to promote the development of creation, but also become a reliable foundation for promoting theoretical learning and improving the theoretical level.

    Third, in order to lead art creation to a higher stage of development, our artists must strengthen their ideological cultivation, improve their ability to understand life, and uninterruptedly obtain the source of creation. On the one hand, we must often go deep into the life of the masses, mingle with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, participate in labor, participate in the heated struggle, and constantly transform and improve our own thoughts in labor and struggle, and timely summarize the experience of the ideological gains and creative material gains obtained in life, as a reference for further going deep into life. On the other hand, we must also redouble our efforts to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, arm ourselves with the advanced world outlook of the working class, so that we can become warriors in building socialism and defending world peace both ideologically and artistically.

    Fourth, the Artists Association and local branches should combine the above tasks and take the development of creation, the organization of theoretical learning, and the organization of members to go deep into the life of the masses as the center of the association's work. The Artists Association and its branches should not only unite art workers throughout the country to form a strong art team of the working class, but also stand closely with the artists of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, stand with the progressive artists of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, stand with the progressive artists of the world, form a broad united front against imperialism, and fight to the end for the common cause of striving for lasting world peace.

    Comrades, the brilliant socialist cause has opened up an infinitely broad future for our art creation, and the leadership of the Party guarantees that we will go from victory to victory. Our responsibility is very heavy, our confidence is incomparably strong, and we should unite closely under the banner of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, and unite closely on the victorious road of the general line of socialist construction, establish high ambitions, never forget to connect with the people's masses and revolutionary struggle at all times, and constantly strengthen ideological cultivation and artistic practice. We will surely create the newest and most beautiful works worthy of our great era, and we will surely continue to achieve new victories and continue to climb the artistic peak of communism.

    为创造最新最美的艺术而奋斗
　　——在中国美术家协会第二次会员代表大会上的报告摘要
　　蔡若虹
    一
　　在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞之下，在为工农兵服务的方向和百花齐放、百家争鸣和推陈出新的方针指导之下，美术创作事业比第二次文代大会以前有了更大的发展，美术的队伍大大地扩展了，美术与劳动人民的关系更加密切了，美术创作的思想水平和艺术水平有了显著的提高。创作的题材内容更加丰富多样，特别在表现劳动人民新的精神面貌方面取得了优越的成绩；形式和风格也有创造性的发展，中国气派和民族特色愈益鲜明。美术创作不仅呈现了空前未有的繁荣，而且成为了我国人民文化生活中不可分离的一个部分。这一巨大的成就，可以从下列的具体情况中看出一个大概的轮廓。
    首先，美术与工农兵群众取得了紧密的结合，美术向劳动人民的普及日益深入和日益扩大，在广大人民的精神生活中产生了积极的影响和作用。
    年画、连环画和宣传画，是美术向广大群众普及最广的作品。这些作品多半是表现劳动人民的日新月异的生活和斗争，表现劳动人民的生活愿望和革命理想，符合于广大群众的欣赏需要，所以近数年来在出版数量上有了更大的发展。这类美术作品的成就当然不仅表现在数量上，印数的增长是与作品质量的提高相联系的。在年画方面，除了及时地表现了工农群众的生产大跃进和生活新气象以外，在艺术风格上也更加适合劳动人民的口味。例如近年来上海、山东、陕西、湖北、广东等省市出版的年画，不仅发扬了年画的优良传统，而且还发扬了不同地区的年画的原有特色，赢得了群众的普遍喜爱。连环画创作也有不少的好作品，《童工》、《我要读书》、《渡江侦察记》、《长石的巨变》、《苗山怒火》等等作品，都博得了广大群众的好评。在连环画创作中涌现了很多优秀的青年作者，连环画所取得的成绩是和他们的辛勤劳动不能分开的。宣传画以上海、北京、天津三市的艺术质量较高，在配合群众运动的宣传方面也比较密切；天津出版的《人民公社好》挂图受到群众的热烈欢迎。蒋兆和的《沿着社会主义道路前进》，哈琼文的《中苏友谊万年长春》，钱大昕的《争取更大的丰收，献给社会主义》，杨文秀的《猪多肥多粮产高》，张汝济的《武装干涉吓不倒争取独立的人民》，都是在宣传鼓动中发挥了积极作用的好作品。除此以外，美术幻灯和地方画报近年来也有很大的发展，已成为工农兵文化生活中不可缺少的部分，是团结人民和教育人民的良好工具。
    其次，在美术与群众密切结合的另一方面，是工农兵业余美术活动的高涨，劳动群众不仅是美术的欣赏者，而且成为美术的创造者，美术事业已经成为我国广大人民的共同事业。
    从1958年开始，随着生产大跃进的开展，工农兵群众业余美术活动也出现了空前大发展的局面。具有较长历史的部队美术活动，继承了革命的光荣传统，在配合政治宣传方面，起了很大的作用。1959年的“军人画展”、“海军画展”、“装甲兵画展”和今年的“第二届全军美展”中出现的大量歌颂三面红旗和反映部队生活的作品，洋溢着爱国主义和国际主义精神，表现了人民战士的英雄气概。解放初期就蓬勃开展起来的工人美术活动，特别是漫画创作活动，在坚持为生产服务，坚持工人阶级的自我教育方面发挥了积极的作用。1958年在天津等地开始出现的工厂史画，是工人美术创作一个重要的发展，对于进一步提高工人群众的阶级觉悟，有很大的帮助。随着工人美术创作的广泛开展，在创作题材、形式和风格方面也逐渐多样化了；例如最近在北京举行的全国铁路职工美术展览会上的作品，就是很好的说明。1958年首先在江苏邳县、河北束鹿和遵化、安徽阜阳、甘肃庆阳等地开展起来的农村壁画运动，以及后来广东湛江的工农版画活动，逐渐形成了全国范围的农村美术创作高潮。和战士、工人的美术创作一样，农民的作品在宣传总路线、推动大跃进和人民公社运动中，起了巨大的作用。群众美术朴实地表现了共产主义的崇高理想和革命热情，具有强烈的革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的精神。工农兵群众美术活动的高涨，在美术创作中增添了新鲜的血液，在我国美术史上揭开了划时代的一页。美术成为广大群众自己掌握的事业，是空前未有的事情。这是文化革命的一个重大胜利，也是文艺的工农兵方向的重大胜利。
    工艺美术是和广大人民的生活实用相联系的，它包括的门类最广，发展也最快。无论在陶瓷、染织、雕刻、刺绣、建筑装饰、书籍装帧等等方面，美术设计和制作技术都有了显著的提高。自从大跃进以来，工艺美术又有进一步的发展；各民族各地区的民间艺人、工艺美术家和技术工人，都发挥了高度的创造性和协作精神，在生产制作方面贯彻了推陈出新的方针，创造了难以数计的富有民族风格和地方色彩的新产品，呈现出一片百花怒放的景象。人民大会堂的建筑装饰和室内用具设计，以及去年在北京举办的全国工艺美术品的展览，就是我国工艺美术事业大跃进的集中表现。工艺美术的优异成绩主要是发扬了民族的优良传统，把雄厚的中国气派和新颖的时代风格结合了起来，所以博得众口一辞的好评。
    中国画创作在民族传统的继承与革新方面，也取得了新的成就。画家们在运用传统的笔墨描写新的现实生活方面达到了熟练的程度；既富有民族特色，而又生动地表现了新的思想内容。描写祖国壮丽山河的《江山如此多娇》（傅抱石、关山月），表现劳动人民征服自然的《移山填谷》（李硕卿）和《举世奇创》（山东艺专美术专修科集体创作），都受到群众的普遍赞赏。其它如《高松图》（何香凝）、《春华》（潘天寿）、《牡丹与白鸽》（于非闇遗作）、《河清可俟》（贺天健）、《为钢铁而战》（江苏中国画院集体创作）、《载歌行》（黄胄）、《雪夜送饭》（杨之光）、《人民公社好》（邵宇）、《电缆工人攻尖端》（鲁迅美术学院中国画系集体创作）、《粒粒皆辛苦》（方增先）等，都是好作品。还应当提出的是，我国许多有声望的中国画家，他们有的年届高龄，仍然孜孜不倦地作画，有的致力于画论的整理和技法的革新，有的将创作经验传授给后辈，有的下厂下乡参加劳动并辅导群众业余美术创作，这种辛勤的劳动，表现了他们爱护社会主义美术事业的高度热情。
    我国的版画创作具有光荣的革命传统，近年来的发展更快，创作水平有了很大的提高，无论在题材内容和表现形式方面，都是万紫千红、丰富多彩，显示出无比繁荣的景象。以革命历史为题材的《刘志丹和赤卫军》（古元），以土地改革为题材的《诉苦》（组画，赵宗藻等作），以藏族人民的新生活为题材的《东方红、太阳升》（牛文）、《扬青稞》（李焕民）、《读》（正威），都具有独特的形式和风格。其它如《陕北江南》（张建文）、《长城内外》（刘旷）、《三更时分》（贾宜群）、《在淮北平原上》（易振生）等等作品，都是通过风景的描写，间接地歌颂了劳动人民改造自然和生产跃进的英雄业绩。《和时间比赛》（赵延年）、《最后一根钢梁》（武石）、《一楼盖成、一楼又起》（李桦），从不同角度上表现了社会主义建设的壮丽风貌。《哨所黎明》（徐琳、项而躬）和《将军田》（张晃），在描写部队生活上有独到之处。《枣园春色》（修军）、《蒲公英》（吴凡）、《雪后》（沈柔坚）和《春》（朱琴葆），在自然景色或人物的刻划上显示了不同的技巧。重庆版画家们创作的火柴盒子装饰和笺谱，是版画创作的新尝试，很值得我们提倡和推广。版画界一个突出的现象，是新人辈出。吴凡、张建文、李焕民、修军、赵宗藻、吴燃等等作者，都是其中优秀的代表。
    油画、炭画和水粉画，在表现历史题材和刻划英雄人物方面具有良好的功能，近年来也出现了不少优秀作品。《血衣》（王式廓）和《当代英雄》（中央美术学院附中教师合作），是两件巨型作品，前者生动地描写了我国农民控诉地主恶霸血腥罪行的斗争，后者精细地刻划了党的领袖和劳动人民杰出的代表人物；虽然这两件作品都是初稿，但在人物形象塑造上都获得了成功。其它如《佛子岭水库》（吴作人）、《毛主席在陕北》（高虹）、《狼牙山五壮士》（詹建俊）、《东渡黄河》（艾中信）、《毛主席和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民在一起》（伍必端、靳尚谊）、《幸福之路》（马常利）、《南下宣传》（蔡亮）、《女配电工》（张隆基）等等作品，不论在主题思想和人物精神面貌的刻划上面，在构图和色彩的运用方面，都具有深刻的意义、丰满的形象或雄厚庄严的气派。中国革命博物馆中的两幅壁画《中国人民大团结》和《世界人民大团结》（黄永玉、周令钊），尽管是作者们第一次的壁画试作，也比较完美地表现了新的时代精神。
    随着文化建设的广泛开展，雕塑创作也在迅速提高，塑造了不少具有历史意义的好作品，矗立在农业展览馆门前的两座雕塑群像《人民公社万岁》（鲁迅美术学院雕塑系集体创作），受到了广大群众的赞扬；作者们适当地吸取了我国传统雕塑的表现方法，强调了艺术的概括手段，着重刻划了我国农民在建立人民公社运动中那种意气风发的精神，达到了形象鲜明、寓意深远的境界。人民英雄纪念碑上的八面浮雕（刘开渠、滑田友、王临乙、萧传玖、张松鹤、曾竹韶、傅天仇等创作），是表现我国近代革命运动和革命战争的初次制作，在形象塑造上也各有特色。《艰苦岁月》（潘鹤），是以思想性深刻博得群众好评的作品。《方腊》的塑像（龙德辉）在民族新风格的探索上，也取得一定的成就。其它如《母女学文化》（袁晓岑）、《李秀成》像（黄立照）、《非洲妇女》（丁絜因）、《铁路工人》（赵树桐）、《移山造海》（中国雕塑工厂集体创作）等等作品，也都为群众所喜爱。
    作为犀利的战斗武器的漫画，在反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的斗争中，对于帝国主义的侵略政策和战争阴谋进行了及时而有力的揭露和打击。我国的漫画家如华君武、米谷、方成、英韬等，都是以漫画进行战斗的能手。在另一方面，漫画在歌颂新生事物的成长、歌颂先进思想的胜利方面，也取得了很好的效果；张乐平、吴耘、江有生以及其他作者们的作品，也都在群众中产生了积极的影响。
    文学书籍的插图也有新的收获。舞台美术装置也在飞速地跃进，无论是话剧、歌剧和舞剧的舞台装置，都在开辟新的舞台局面，创造了多种多样的舞台风格，而又具有鲜明的民族特色。
    我国动画电影的历史很短，但近年来进步很快，显示了峥嵘的头角；在发扬民族美术风格的基础上创造了剪纸动画、折纸动画和水墨动画，为动画电影的民族化和群众化开辟了广阔的道路，取得了优异的成绩。
    由于美术教育事业和群众美术活动的广泛开展，我们美术队伍更加壮大了。经过1957年的整风运动和反右派斗争，美术家积极地下厂下乡，参加了群众运动和劳动锻炼，进一步同工农群众相结合，生活方式和思想感情都起了变化，革命的世界观和艺术观日趋巩固。近两年来，美术家又努力学习毛泽东同志著作和文艺理论，加强了艺术修养和创作实践，批判地继承了民族美术遗产，提高了造型艺术的表现能力；这一切，都是美术创作取得巨大成就的主要因素。尽管美术创作还存在一些缺点，还不能满足广大群众日益增长的要求，但是，我们所经历的创作道路是一条最正确、最广阔的道路，只要我们遵循党的文艺方向和文艺方针，就必定会取得更大的成就。党的领导保证了美术事业的胜利。我们已经取得的成就，也就是为工农兵服务的文艺方向的胜利，也就是百花齐放、百家争鸣和推陈出新的文艺方针的胜利。归根到底，是毛泽东思想的胜利。
　　二
    文艺为工农兵服务，这是十八年前毛泽东同志为我们文艺工作者指出的方向。在这一方向的指导之下，我们美术创作也起了根本的变化，历来为少数人服务的美术归还到千千万万的工农兵群众的手里，为革命的利益服务，为群众的需要服务，为社会主义事业服务。这是美术的一次大革命，在我国美术史上开辟了新的纪元。
    工农兵既然是美术的服务对象，就不能不是美术的表现对象。以造型艺术真实地和深刻地表现工农兵，表现他们新的生活和革命斗争，这是一件新的工作，一件具有重大意义的工作。我国的美术家遵照毛泽东同志的指示，积极地与工农兵群众相结合，逐步改变了旧的世界观和艺术观，通过不断的创作实践，取得了一些基本经验，获得了巨大成绩。现在回过头来看看，我们的美术是怎样为工农兵服务的呢？是怎样表现工农兵的呢？和过去那些为少数人服务的美术有哪些不同呢？它在广大群众中起了什么作用和影响呢？要明确这些问题，只有在美术作品中去找得答案。
    从我们十多年来的美术作品看来，在创作主题方面是很有特点的。第一个明显的特点，是反映了工农兵群众的革命运动和革命战争；表现了革命英雄人物和他们坚贞不拔的品质。在过去的时代里，工农群众没有在美术作品中得到应有的地位，工农群众的革命斗争更是很少在美术作品中出现。现在，在我们的美术作品里，就完全改变了这种情况。尽管作者们所采取的革命题材不同，表现手法也不一样；但是，却有一个共同的描绘中心，这就是表现了革命者的坚定形象，勇敢的形象，胜利者的形象。《艰苦岁月》所刻划的人民战士的革命乐观主义精神，正表现了我国工农群众在革命遭受到挫折时的共同精神。《狼牙山五壮士》所描写的宁死不屈的英雄形象，也表现了我国人民取得抗战胜利的精神力量。《血衣》和《诉苦》，描绘了觉醒的农民的斗志。庄严雄伟的《当代英雄》，是描写党的领袖领导着人民向胜利前进的画图。在其它的绘画和雕塑作品中，作者们刻意描画的，也正是革命英雄人物的顽强斗志和坚定不移的胜利信心。同时，又和对于革命领袖的爱戴结合在一起。这不仅正确反映了我国工农群众的革命意志，而且也正确反映了我们这个革命大发展的时代精神。从这些作品里面，可以看出工农群众解放自己的道路，可以看出革命斗争是决定人类命运的主宰；它启发革命觉悟，增强战斗力量，鼓舞革命继续前进。这就是表现革命斗争的美术的作用，也是这些作品取得了广大群众的信任、爱护和支持的原因。
    在我们的美术作品里，另一个特点，是反映了工农兵群众新的劳动精神；表现了劳动人民建设社会主义的强大力量，表现了生产大跃进的雄伟图景。在旧时代，当工农群众还处在剥削阶级统治之下的年代，劳动又总是和雇佣、奴役、生活的苦难联系在一起。只有在工农群众推翻剥削阶级的统治、自己当家作主的社会主义国家里，劳动的积极性和创造性才得到高度的发扬，在社会主义生产建设中创造了层出不穷的美景。《女配电工》里的女工形象，《电缆工人攻尖端》里的工人形象，《举世奇创》里的劳动群众的形象，都明显地刻划了这种新的精神面貌。在另外一些作品里，作者们又从不同的侧面描画了我们劳动生活的愉快和庄严；《冬瓜上高楼》里的丰收的快乐，《载歌行》里集体农民的欢唱，都画出了生产大跃进的胜利凯歌。《将军田》表现了我们革命将领热爱劳动的高贵品质。《三更时分》是表现人民公社社员们的高度劳动热情。《移山填谷》更强烈地表现了劳动人民在征服自然中所显示的无穷威力。而《陕北江南》和《长城内外》，又描绘了被改造了的自然的壮丽图景。从这许多作品里面，可以看出社会主义的劳动和过去时代是多么不同。可以看出我国人民改变祖国面貌的雄心壮志，可以看出工农群众建设社会主义的强大力量。这些作品振奋人心，鼓舞人心，激发人们爱劳动爱祖国的热情，在广大人民中起了积极的影响和作用。
    在我们的美术作品里，还有一个特点，这就是表现了劳动人民生活的新气象，表现了建立在社会主义思想基础上的人与人之间的新关系，表现了工农兵群众的新思想、新道德和新品质。姜燕的《考考妈妈》，出色地反映了劳动妇女学习文化的决心，同时，又从向女儿求教的母亲身上，刻划了劳动人民的优良品质。胡悌麟的《孤儿》，是描写抗美援朝的战士为流落的孤儿缝补衣服的一个生活片断，充分表现了我们人民战士的阶级友爱和国际主义精神。蔡亮的《借宿》，是通过地质工作者在藏族人民家里借宿的一个场面，生动地表现了藏族人民对于国家干部的深情厚意，而又反映了劳动人民的阶级感情。杨之光的《雪夜送饭》，是表现劳动人民的相互协作和不畏辛苦不怕困难的高贵品质。牛文的《东方红、太阳升》、黄胄的《出诊》、邵宇的《首都速写》、于月川的《夜读》，以及其它很多作品，都是描写生活的新气象，都是着重表现劳动人民的新思想、新道德和新品质。这里可以看出，这些新生事物的涌现，是社会主义思想园地中培养出来的最新最美的花朵，是十分可贵的精神财富，是先进的工人阶级思想战胜了旧思想旧习惯的鲜明标志。我们的美术表现了这些新鲜事物，就必定促进新生事物的壮大和普遍发展。从这些作品里面，可以看出时代前进的脚步，可以看见生活的美好前途。它引导人们精神向上、生活向上，它令人对革命充满了信心，它鼓舞人们向共产主义的伟大目标前进。
    我们美术创作的内容是十分丰富的，以上提出的不过是作品中几种普遍的主题，是表现工农兵的生活和斗争的几个主要方面。离开这些主题，就不能显示生活的真实面貌。离开了这些主题，就不可能发挥为工农兵服务的巨大作用。我们美术家在党的领导之下开辟了这样一条正确的创作道路，是应当引为自豪的。
    可是，现代修正主义者却有完全不同的看法；他们认为社会主义美术已经“过时”了，只有抽象主义美术才是世界上最新鲜的东西。他们标榜“写真实”，可是又反对写工农兵的真实。他们认为美术不应当有什么宣传教育的目的，可是又大为资产阶级艺术捧场，好像资产阶级的美术是毫无目的的。把修正主义者这些看法联在一起，就不难明白，他们说社会主义美术已经“过时”的意思，就是叫一切进步的美术退回到资产阶级美术的老路上去。他们所说的“真实”，就是指资产阶级“内心世界”里的垃圾。他们反对美术的宣传教育的目的，也仅仅是反对美术为革命宣传和教育人民的目的，而并不反对美术欺骗人民、麻痹人民和为反动思想作宣传的目的。这就是现代修正主义者的真正意图。
    在文艺为工农兵服务的政治方向之下，党又提出了百花齐放，百家争鸣和推陈出新的方针。这是促进艺术发展和科学进步的方针，是促进我国的社会主义文化繁荣的方针。这一方针得到全国美术工作者的热烈拥护，并且在创作实践上努力地贯彻执行。事实证明，美术事业的迅速发展和创作的日益繁荣，美术作品得到广大群众的喜爱和支持，正是执行这一正确方针的结果。
    美术工作贯彻这一方针的具体内容，是民族美术传统的继承和革新，不同的题材和体裁的自由运用，不同的形式和风格的自由发展，外来形式与民族特点相结合，普及与提高相结合，而政治方向的一致性和艺术风格的多样性的统一，则是执行这一方针的共同原则。
    在民族美术传统的继承与革新方面，我们是先从与广大群众有着密切联系的民间美术着手的。
    改造民间美术，让本来为劳动人民所理解所喜爱的民间美术取得新的思想内容，适合于今天的劳动人民的需要；这是美术向广大群众普及的首要任务。年画和连环图画的改造，就是具体的例子。
    我国的年画，是在广大农民中流传最广、影响最深的一种民间美术。年画的内容，总不外是五谷丰收，人畜两旺，以及英雄人物的故事；这反映了我国农民朴素的生活理想，而年画就是我国农民理想的写照。年画在表现手法上，具有独特的寓意手法和装饰意味，这是和内容上的浪漫主义精神不能分开的。我们改造年画，并不抛弃它的这些优点，而是以新的生活内容和思想内容，来充实和发扬这些优点。经过改造的年画，实际上就是表现工农群众在劳动和斗争的实践中实现新的理想的图画。这些新的年画不仅赢得了农民群众的热烈赞赏，而且受到了一切劳动人民的欢迎，在人民的精神生活中产生了积极的作用。
    连环画，也是我国民间美术中传播最广的一种。过去的连环画在思想内容上很不健康，图画也非常拙劣，对劳动人民没有好处。所以我们改造连环画，首先是改变连环画的反动、落后和陈腐的内容，选择对劳动群众有教育意义的文艺作品，改编和创作出新的连环画，并在这一基础上提高艺术水平。连环画的脚本编写工作，是体现作品思想内容和发挥美术表现能力的主要关键。凡是博得群众好评的连环画，都不是简单地交代故事过程，而是通过人物行动的刻划，集中表现作品的主题思想；脚本的编写工作，在这里起着决定性的作用。目前连环画已经成为劳动人民最爱好的读物。只有不断提高思想水平和艺术水平，才能满足广大群众日益增长的需要。
    民间美术的革新，是社会主义美术密切联系群众的重要途径，十年的工作证明，普及与提高相结合的道路，是贯彻党的文艺方针的一条正确道路。
    其次，我们采用了我国传统美术的题材和体裁，从各个不同的角度表现新的生活风貌和思想风貌，从而适合广大劳动人民和干部的多方面的欣赏要求。
    我国传统的美术，是按照人物、山水、花卉等等题材范围分类的。在人物画方面，肖像画占有很大的比重。在封建时代里，肖像画的领域完全被帝王、贵族、地主、官僚之类的人物所独占；创造社会财富的劳动者，很难在肖像画中取得一席地位。这种不合理的现象继续了两千余年，只有在工农人民当了国家的主人公以后，劳动者才成为肖像画的主人公。在我们新的肖像画里，有普通的工人、农民和士兵，还有劳动战线上的英雄模范，劳动人民的功臣和领袖。画家吴作人、王式廓、罗工柳、董希文、蒋兆和、李斛、张振仕等等，他们的肖像作品经常得到群众的好评。新的肖像画坛，已经成为劳动人民的麒麟阁，让千千万万的人民英雄流芳万古，才不辜负我们这个英雄辈出的伟大时代。
    描写自然美的山水画和花鸟画，在我国美术史上一直占有很大的地位。人们欣赏自然，赞美自然，往往结合着生活的想像和联想；自然风物的特点，往往被看作人的精神拟态。人们赞美山的雄伟、海的壮阔、松的坚贞、鹤的傲岸，同时也是赞美着人，赞美与自然特点相吻合的人的精神。在山水画和花鸟画中，客观的美和主观的思想感情就是这样地融合在一起。作品中的阶级色彩，常常比较隐晦、曲折和微弱，但是，如果以不同的历史时期的作品来作比较，就可以看出，描写自然美的作品也同样反映一个时代的阶级要求（在选择题材和对待描写对象的态度中，不可能不包括作者的主观愿望），表现自然美的创作同样不能超脱于阶级意识以外。所谓如实地描写现实，所谓纯客观地表现自然，是根本不存在的。在我们新的山水、花鸟画中，也并不例外。有不少作品，都是通过自然美体现了劳动人民的思想感情，体现了工农群众那种健康的、丰富的、高尚的精神境界。当六亿人民正在精神焕发地实现自己的宏伟的理想的时候，以革命浪漫主义精神创作更新更美的山水画和花鸟画，是完全符合广大群众的要求的。
    在民族形式和风格的继承和革新方面，美术家在创作实践中作了多方面的探索；批判地继承，创造性地革新，推动了民族新形式、新风格的普遍发展，革命的内容和完美的形式逐渐趋于统一。
    历史悠久的我国美术，是具有鲜明的民族特点的；它描写生活而又不机械地模仿生活，主张造型的神似而又不脱离形似；特别重视艺术的概括手段，强调从高度的概括中表达意境；既状物而又抒情，既写实而又写意；所谓“外师造化，中得心源”，就是把反映客观物象的真实性和表现思想感情的主观能动性有机地结合在一起。一切的表现形式和表现手法，都是从这个总的原则产生的。随着历史的发展，美术的表现形式和表现方法也在沿着这条道路发展，不断地变革，不断地丰富，绝对不是一成不变的。美术家学习传统的形式和表现手法，由于首先理解了产生这种形式和手法的根源，才不至于无批判地继承，才能够在原有基础上进行革新和创造，才可以与新的思想内容相适应。近数年来，中国画和版画的显著成就，就在于不是无条件地搬用传统形式和表现手法，就在于从继承传统的基础上发挥了艺术的独创性，所以作品的形式和内容就逐步地趋于统一，逐渐形成了具有民族特点的新形式和新风格，呈现了一片百花齐放、万紫千红的繁荣景象。在雕塑和油画方面，外来形式与民族特点相溶合的尝试已得到初步的成效，新型的民族风格正在形成。其它如动画电影、舞台美术、文学作品的插图等等方面，也在创造民族新形式的道路上努力前进，独创性的风格大量涌现，达到了前所未有的艺术繁荣。艺术的民族化和群众化是不能分割的。为了满足广大群众的欣赏口味，我们美术家坚持了发扬美术的民族特点这一正确的原则，民族美术的新花朵，在社会主义的土壤中得到普遍的发育、成长，并放射异彩。这是我们美术创作领域中值得欢欣鼓舞的新气象。
    以上是根据美术创作在百花齐放、推陈出新的方针下具体实践情况的简略说明。从以上的具体事例中可以看出，百花齐放、推陈出新的方针，给美术创作打开了一条无比广阔的道路，开辟了社会主义美术的新天地，证明了党的文艺方针，是经得起事实考验的最正确的方针。
    我们的百花齐放，是在为工农兵服务的政治方向之下的百花齐放；我们的推陈出新，是在为工农兵的利益和需要服务之下的推陈出新。政治方向的一致性和艺术风格的多样性的统一，是我们坚定不移的原则。可是现代修正主义者和具有资产阶级艺术观点的人们却以种种借口来歪曲这一原则。他们把百花齐放曲解为可以让资产阶级的毒草合法存在，并且反对推陈出新。他们片面强调提高来反对艺术向劳动人民普及。他们把艺术的多样性和政治方向的一致性对立起来，借此否定政治方向的一致性。他们这样做的目的，无非是要美术脱离广大人民，无非是要将资产阶级的毒草来代替社会主义的香花。无非是想取消文艺为工农兵服务的政治方向。修正主义者和资产阶级美术家都特别标榜艺术创作的自由；这是欺骗，不认识客观真理、不服从客观真理的人哪里会有自由，他们只有服从于豢养者的钱袋的“自由”，只有把艺术当作商品买卖的自由，只有用艺术欺骗人民、麻痹人民的自由。具有工人阶级先进思想的我国美术家，认识了社会的发展规律，看清了生活的发展前途，他们的画笔就可以驰骋宇宙，描写万象，这才是真正的创作自由。我们百花齐放的艺术繁荣，就雄辩地说明了这一真理。修正主义者认为美术向劳动人民普及是迁就群众；说抽象主义虽然目前劳动人民看不懂，但将来一定会接受的。这就又暴露了他们虚伪的嘴脸，劳动人民是永远不会要他们这种侮辱人类、腐烂透顶的“艺术”的。至于说到将来，劳动人民是有着无限美妙的未来的，社会主义美术也有着远大的发展前途的。只有贩卖资产阶级私货的现代修正主义者，是绝对不会有将来的；这是历史注定了的。
　　三
　　同志们，我们处在全世界人民反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的革命斗争空前高涨的时代，我们处在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营空前强大、社会主义事业不断取得胜利的时代，我们美术家和各个思想战线上的战士一样，为了提高人民社会主义共产主义的思想觉悟和道德品质，为了鼓舞人民的革命意志和劳动热情，为了美化祖国和丰富人民的精神生活，我们必须坚定不移地遵从党的领导，在美术事业上付出更大的力量，争取新的更大的胜利。今后我们的任务是什么呢？
    第一，必须在坚持为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务的政治方向和百花齐放、百家争鸣、推陈出新的文艺方针下进一步地发展创作，创造更多更好的作品，这是我们全体美术家的根本任务。美术向工农兵群众普及，仍然是摆在创作的首要地位，我们必须在美术普及工作的现有基础上，不断地提高创作的思想水平和艺术水平，才能够满足群众日益增长的审美要求。我们还应当继续开展工农兵业余美术活动，辅导群众创作，促进群众业余美术创作走向更大的繁荣。随着社会主义文化建设的广泛开展，对于绘画、版画、雕塑和工艺美术的需要日益增加，我们必须加强创作实践，批判地继承遗产，提高造型艺术的表现技巧，使正确的思想内容和优美的艺术形式取得完满的结合，使教育人民的创作目的和相应的艺术手段求得一致，从而创作出中国气派的、具有深刻思想内容和艺术感染力量的作品。此外，我们还应当加强美术创作中的薄弱环节，特别是儿童美术读物，对于儿童思想教育起有重大作用；我们必须大力发展适合于儿童阅读的美术作品，并将培养审美能力和进行共产主义教育紧密地结合起来，让建设社会主义的接班人在美育中得到健康的成长，这是我们美术家最光荣的不可推卸的职责。
    第二，发展美术创作是不能和发展艺术理论分开的；对于艺术理论的忽视，将不利于创作的健康发展。我们的艺术理论工作必须密切地联系实际，必须和根除现代修正主义思想影响以及和各种资产阶级艺术倾向进行斗争结合在一起，反对那种脱离思想斗争、无助于提高创作水平和欣赏水平的空谈。我们的艺术理论工作应当建立在推动创作发展的基础之上，开展作品评论；总结创作经验，研究我国美术优良的传统，探讨革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的艺术方法，是我们美术方面理论建设的重点。特别在作品评论方面，我们既要坚决执行政治标准第一的原则，同时也应当将作品的基本倾向和局部问题加以区别，反对不通过艺术上的具体分析的粗暴批评。我们应当多方鼓励艺术的独创性和风格的多样性，对于创作中涌现的新生力量要特别加以扶植，使作品评论不仅成为促进创作发展的有力工具，而且成为推动理论学习和提高理论水平的可靠基础。
    第三，为了将美术创作引向更高的阶段发展，我们美术家就必须加强自己的思想修养，提高认识生活的能力，不间断地取得创作的源泉。我们一方面要经常地深入群众生活，和工农兵群众打成一片，参与劳动，参与火热的斗争，在劳动和斗争中不断地改造和提高自己的思想，及时地总结在生活中所取得的思想收获和创作材料的收获的经验，作为进一步深入生活的参考和借鉴。另一方面，我们还必须加倍努力地学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作，以先进的工人阶级世界观武装自己，使自己无论在思想上和艺术上都成为建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的战士。
    第四，美术家协会与地方分会，应当结合以上任务，将发展创作、组织理论学习、组织会员深入群众生活，作为协会工作的中心。美术家协会和各个分会，不仅要团结全国美术工作者，形成一支强大的工人阶级的美术队伍；而且要同苏联和其他兄弟国家的美术家亲密地站在一起，和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的进步美术家站在一起，和全世界的进步美术家站在一起，结成广泛的反对帝国主义的统一战线，为争取世界持久和平的共同事业而奋斗到底。
    同志们，光辉灿烂的社会主义事业给我们美术创作开辟了无限广阔的前途，党的领导保证了我们从胜利走向胜利，我们的责任是十分重大的，我们的信心是无比坚强的，我们应当在毛泽东思想的光辉旗帜下紧密地团结起来，在社会主义建设总路线的胜利道路上紧密地团结起来，树雄心立大志，时刻不忘地联系人民群众和革命斗争，不断地加强思想修养和艺术实践，我们就必定会创造出最新最美的无愧于我们伟大时代的作品，我们就必定会不断地取得新的胜利，一直攀登共产主义的艺术高峰。
