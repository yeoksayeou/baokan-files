    Educated Youth Love the Countryside, Love Agricultural Labor
    Wang Yulan Buries Herself in Hard Work to Build the Mountainous Region

    (Our report) Wang Yulan, a 21-year-old Communist Party member and secretary of the Communist Youth League branch in Woli Village, Shanting Commune, Teng County, Shandong Province, has, under the Party's guidance, been determined to become strong, burying herself in hard work. For three years, she has labored steadily and diligently, making outstanding contributions to building a new socialist countryside.

    After graduating from senior elementary school in July 1957, Wang Yulan originally planned to enter middle school. However, this relatively remote mountainous area was in great need of educated youth, and the Party committee called for some people to stay on the agricultural front. Wang Yulan has always listened to the Party, and she knew that following the path pointed out by the Party meant fulfilling the needs of the people and having a bright future. Therefore, she decided not to continue her education and stayed in the countryside. Because of her active labor and enthusiastic work, she was elected secretary of the Communist Youth League branch in the spring of 1958 and then participated in the county women's congress. At this meeting, the report by Fang Lin’s Wife from the "Railway Guerrilla" deeply moved her. When Fang Lin’s Wife spoke about how people endured unimaginable hardships during the difficult years of the struggle against the enemy, and finally achieved victory, she shed tears of excitement, thinking in her heart, "Although life in the countryside is not yet prosperous, it is like heaven and earth compared to the past. Precisely because the current standard of living is still low, we must work harder to build our hometown. The revolutionary predecessors shed blood and sacrificed themselves to open up the road to a happy life for us. How can we be worthy of them if we don't work hard!"

    That winter, Yulan was busy managing the high-yield wheat field in the team. Her sister, who was working in Jilin, sent her a letter offering to find her a job and enclosing travel expenses to go there. The whole family was preparing luggage and food for Yulan to go to the city, and her father even went to the city to have a small coat made for her, all thinking that Yulan would happily go to the Northeast. But she did not waver in the slightest. She said, "The commune needs me, so I shouldn't leave. City life is good, but we must build the countryside to be like the city." She politely declined her sister and family's "kind intentions." Her father and mother were both angry and said she was born to suffer, and Yulan replied, "Today's hardship is tomorrow's sweetness. If no one wants to suffer and everyone wants to enjoy the fruits of labor, how can the countryside be built well, and how can the country be built well!" And she used the fact that the lives of the whole village and her family had gradually improved over the years to convince her family.

    Wang Yulan knew that building a new socialist countryside was built on ordinary and specific labor, and it required constant struggle against difficulties, so she always took the lead in hard work, going wherever the difficulties were, and doing whatever work was heavy or dirty. The north side of Woli Village was a barren mountain. In the spring of 1958, Wang Yulan led all 21 members of the Communist Youth League and 70 young people in the village in a battle to close off the mountain for afforestation. At first, they were digging fish-scale pits. Every day before the sun rose, the young people would go up the mountain with dry rations, and only come down after the sun set. Wang Yulan was always at the forefront, and she dared to compete with any young man. The mountain was steep and the rocks were hard, but not as hard as the determination of the young people. The barren mountain finally bowed its head. In half a month, more than two thousand fish-scale pits were dug.

    They had fish-scale pits, but no saplings. Wang Yulan first pulled up jujube saplings and locust saplings from in front of and behind her own house, and then mobilized the youth to carry out sapling donation activities. Soon, they collected more than four thousand saplings and cut down more than three thousand willow and poplar saplings from the river滩, and all of them were planted on Xida Mountain. At the same time, they also carried out the "one jin of grain from each fish-scale pit" campaign, planting pumpkins, cowpeas, and other crops next to the fish-scale pits. To make the barren mountain green, how could they rely on just these saplings? Yulan proposed to establish a youth nursery. With the support of the Party branch, the commune gave them eight mu of poor land to use as a nursery, and Yulan led the youth to reclaim one mu of wasteland to cultivate a large number of seedlings. By autumn, the slopes of Xida Mountain were all planted with trees, and more than 450,000 saplings were cultivated. At the same time, they also harvested a large number of pumpkins, cowpeas, mung beans, soybeans, etc.

    After the communization, Wang Yulan participated in a delegation organized by the county. The deeds of the Steel Five Sisters of Shou Zhang County greatly encouraged her. "They are young people, and we are also young people. Our land is barren, but their land is not good either. Why can't we create high yields like them!" she asked herself. After returning from the visit, the commune was carrying out a large-scale high-yield wheat field campaign, so she connected nine girls and formed a "East Wind Ten Sisters Team" to carry out deep plowing. After plowing the land for a day, her hands were so sore in the morning that she couldn't clench them, so Yulan told them the story of the Steel Five Sisters to encourage everyone. Under their impetus, six hundred mu of high-yield fields were sown in a timely manner.

    To create high yields in mountainous areas, more fertilizer was essential. Yulan led the girls to find sources of fertilizer in every possible way. They first contracted the fifteen public toilets of the Dongjiang production team, digging manure every day to irrigate the wheat. Once, Chai Peixiang, a worker from the nearby open-pit coal mine, came home to visit his family and was greatly moved by the situation of Yulan and the girls accumulating and applying fertilizer. He said to her, "If you are not afraid of being tired and freezing, go to the coal mine to collect manure. There is a lot of manure there!" Yulan was overjoyed when she heard this, and the next day before dawn, she led the girls to the coal mine more than 30 li away, crossing mountains and rivers. As the girls pushed and carried carts and baskets full of manure back in the evening, their shoulders were swollen and their feet were blistered. When the Party Branch Secretary saw this, he told them to rest for a few days before continuing, but the next day Yulan led the girls to irrigate the fields again, and the third day they went to the coal mine to collect manure again…

    The hard work of Yulan, the East Wind Ten Sisters, and the vast number of commune members resulted in an unprecedented bumper harvest of 600 mu of high-yield fields.

    Wang Yulan is wholeheartedly for the commune and the collective. In her life, she is simple and frugal, hardworking and thrifty, enduring hardship first and enjoying later.

    Yulan often attends meetings at the provincial, county, and commune levels. Every time she attends a meeting, she only takes her own food rations and exchanges them for food stamps, and leaves with her own money, never asking the team for travel expenses. Sometimes the team and commune give her a few yuan, but she refuses them all. She said, "It doesn't cost money to attend meetings. Our family is poor now, so we should save as much as we can." Last year, when she went to the provincial people's hero convention, the commune wanted to buy her a new suit of clothes, but she firmly refused, saying, "It's enough to be dressed cleanly, we can't waste the country's money." To get from Woli to the county seat, one has to walk 50 li of mountain road. Every time she attends a meeting, she hurries back to the team as early as possible to engage in production. This July, when the county party congress adjourned, it was already after 7 PM, but she was worried about the farm work in the team and rushed back overnight. Before the roosters crowed the next day, she had rushed back to the production team. After breakfast, she went with the commune members to turn the land and control pests.

    Under the education of the Party, Comrade Wang Yulan is determined to become strong and puts all her energy into the cause of building a new socialist countryside. Over the past three years, she has grown from an ordinary rural girl into a glorious Communist Party member, has been loved by the commune members, and has been repeatedly praised and rewarded by the Party. She has been awarded the March 8th Medal, the May 4th Commemorative Medal, and the May 4th Medal by the country and the province.

    知识青年热爱农村热爱农业劳动
    王玉兰埋头苦干建设山区
    本报讯　山东省滕县山亭公社沃里村二十一岁的共产党员、团支部书记王玉兰，在党的教导下，发愤图强，埋头苦干，三年来，踏踏实实、勤勤恳恳地劳动，为建设社会主义新农村做出了优异的贡献。
    王玉兰1957年7月高小毕业后，本来打算升入中学。但是这个比较偏僻的山区非常需要知识青年，党委号召应当有一部分人留在农业战线。王玉兰一贯听党的话，她知道按照党所指引的道路走，就是人民的需要，就有光明的前途，所以决定不去升学，留在农村。由于她劳动积极，工作热心，1958年春被选为团支书，接着又参加了县妇代会。在这次会上，“铁道游击队”里的芳林嫂的报告深深感动了她。当芳林嫂讲到在对敌斗争的艰难岁月里，人们怎样忍受着难以想像的艰苦，终于取得了胜利时，她流下了激动的眼泪，心里想：“现在农村的生活虽然还不富裕，可是和过去比起来，真是天上地下。正因为现在的生活水平还低，才越要艰苦奋斗，建设家乡。革命前辈流血牺牲为我们开辟了通向幸福生活的大道，我们再不好好干能对得起谁！”
    这年冬天，玉兰正忙着管理队里的小麦丰产田，在吉林工作的姐姐给她来了封信，要给她找工作，并寄来了路费让她去。全家人都在为玉兰进城准备行装和路上的吃食，父亲还特地进城给她做了件小大衣，都以为玉兰会愉快地去东北。可是她丝毫没有动摇，她说：“社里需要我，我就不应当走。城市生活好，我们就要把农村建设得和城市一样。”她婉言谢绝了姐姐和家里人的一番“好意”。父亲、母亲都生气地说她是生就了的吃苦的命，玉兰回答说：“今天的苦就是明天的甜。都不想吃苦，想坐享清福，农村怎么能建设好，国家怎么能建设好！”她并且用全村和家庭几年来生活逐步提高的事实，说服了全家人。
    王玉兰知道建设社会主义新农村，是建立在一件件平凡而具体的劳动上，是要不断地向困难作斗争，所以她处处带头苦干，那里困难到那里去，什么活重活脏她就干什么。沃里村的北面是一片荒山。1958年春天，王玉兰就带领全村的二十一名团员和七十名青年，进行了封山造林的战斗。起初，是挖鱼鳞坑。每天太阳还没出，青年们就带着干粮上了山，太阳落了才下山。王玉兰一直干在最前头，那个小伙子她也敢和他赛赛。山陡石硬，但不如青年们的决心硬，荒山终于低头了，半个月时间，共挖好鱼鳞坑两千多个。
    有了鱼鳞坑，却没有树苗子，王玉兰首先从自己家的园前屋后拔来了枣树苗、洋槐苗，又发动青年开展了献树苗活动，很快就采集树苗四千多棵，又从河滩上砍来柳树、杨树苗三千多棵，全部栽到了西大山上；同时，还开展了“向每个鱼鳞坑要一斤粮”的活动，在鱼鳞坑的旁边种上了方瓜、豆角等。要绿化荒山，光靠这点树苗哪能行？玉兰提出要建立个青年苗圃。在党支部的支持下，社里给了八亩薄地当苗圃，玉兰又带领青年们开了一亩荒，大量育苗。到秋季，西大山坡上全栽上了树，培育树苗四十五万多棵，同时，还收获了大量方瓜、豆角、绿豆、大豆等。
    公社化后，王玉兰参加了县里组织的参观团，寿张县钢铁五姊妹的事迹给了她很大鼓舞。“人家是青年，咱也是青年，咱这里地薄，人家那里地也不好，为啥咱不能像人家一样创高产！”她自问自己。参观回来，公社正在搞大面积小麦丰产方，她就串连了九个姑娘，成立了一个“东风十姊妹队”，突击深翻地。翻一天地，早晨起来两手疼的不能攥，玉兰就讲钢铁五姊妹的故事给她们听，给大家鼓劲。在她们的带动下，六百亩丰产田适时播下了种子。
    山地要创高产非得多施肥不可。玉兰就带领姑娘们千方百计找肥源，她们首先包下了东江生产队的十五个公共厕所，每天挖粪肥，给小麦打眼灌稀。有一次，附近露天煤矿工人柴培祥回来看家，见玉兰和姑娘们积肥追肥的情形，大受感动，对她说：“要是不怕累，不怕冻，到煤矿去拾粪吧，那里粪多着哩！”玉兰一听，喜出望外，第二天天还没明就带领着姑娘们翻山涉水到三十多里地以外的煤矿去了。傍黑，当姑娘们推着、挑着满车满筐的粪肥回来的时候，肩膀压肿了，两脚磨起了泡。党支书见到这情况，让她们休息几天再干，可是第二天玉兰又带领着姑娘们打眼灌稀，第三天又去煤矿拾粪去了……
    玉兰和东风十姊妹以及广大社员的辛勤劳动，换来了六百亩丰产田的空前大丰收。
    王玉兰一心为社、为集体，在生活上，艰苦朴素，克勤克俭，吃苦在前，享受在后。
    玉兰常到省、县、公社出席一些会议，每次开会，她只是拿自己的口粮换点粮票，带着自己的钱就走了，从没向队里支过一次差旅费。有时队里和公社给她几元钱，也都被她拒绝了。她说：“开会用不着花钱。现在我们的家底子薄，能省的就省。”去年她到省开群英会，公社要给她买套新衣裳，她坚决不要，说：“穿的干干净净的就行了，可不能给国家浪费钱。”从沃里到县城，得走五十里的山路，每次开会，她都及早赶回队里投入生产。今年7月，县党代会散会时，已是晚上七点多了，她却挂记着队里的农活，连夜往回赶。第二天鸡还没叫，她就赶回了生产队。早饭后又和社员们一起翻地、治虫去了。
    王玉兰同志在党的教育下，发愤图强，把自己的身心全部用在建设社会主义新农村的事业上。三年来，她从一个普通的农村姑娘成长为一个光荣的共产党员，受到社员们的爱戴，受到党的多次表扬与奖励，曾荣获全国和省颁发的三八奖章、五四纪念章和五四奖章。
