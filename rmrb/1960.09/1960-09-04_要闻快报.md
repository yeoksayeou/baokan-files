Guizhou's Indigenous Coking Plants Implement Hydraulic Washing and Screening

Guizhou's various indigenous coking plants are vigorously implementing a hydraulic washing, screening, transportation "one-stop" system to produce more high-quality coke to support the iron and steel industry.

This technological reform is being carried out on the basis of already achieving simple coal washing. The method involves: constructing a water channel, connecting the coal accumulation area beside the coal kiln, the coal washing tank, screening equipment, and the fine coal settling pond; using mountain water or underground water as power to impact and wash the raw coal. After washing and screening, the raw coal is sent into the kiln to be dewatered automatically, and then ignited for coking. This process enables the entire coke production to form a "one-stop" system through hydraulic power. Currently, 90% of Guizhou's indigenous coking plants have realized hydraulic washing, screening, and transportation "one-stop" system. After the Shichangba Coke Plant in Tongzi County changed from manual washing, selection, transportation, and loading to hydraulic washing, selection, transportation, and loading, the monthly coke production increased more than twofold.

Tianjin Launches Large-Scale Coal Conservation Campaign

The broad masses of workers in various industries in Tianjin are launching a "Ten Comparisons" coal conservation campaign, with the consolidation, improvement, and promotion of coal gasification and the vigorous promotion of cyclic combustion as the main content. The ten comparisons are: comparing the progress and normal operation of coal gasification, comparing extensive use of raw coal, comparing reduced coal consumption, comparing reduced combustibles in ash, comparing the matching of advanced technology, comparing safety management, comparing improved working conditions, comparing comprehensive utilization, and comparing technical collaboration. In order to vigorously promote the progress of coal conservation work, recently many units exchanged and promoted more than thirty experiences in coal conservation.

Sichuan Strengthens Management of Late Autumn Crops

Since August, various parts of Sichuan have used vacant fields and soil and adopted intercropping and multiple cropping methods to plant more than ten kinds of late autumn grains such as autumn sweet potatoes, autumn potatoes, buckwheat, late corn, carrots, and a large number of late autumn vegetables. The planting area of late autumn crops and autumn vegetables has greatly increased compared with previous years. The temperature and sunshine in the Sichuan Basin in September and October are most suitable for crop growth. Timely and firm grasp of the field management of these late autumn crops is of great benefit to striving for increased production of late autumn crops and promoting the early maturity of late autumn crops, so as to vacate the land in time for planting wheat and rapeseed and other crops. Now, Nanchong, Neijiang, Wenjiang and other special districts, while vigorously grasping late autumn planting, are mobilizing the masses to formulate specific management measures by summarizing the experience of increasing late autumn production over the years, and organizing sufficient labor to be specifically responsible for late autumn management.

Heilongjiang Completes Harvesting of Spring Wheat

Heilongjiang Province, a major spring wheat producing area, has completely harvested its 14 million mu of wheat and is now hauling it back to the threshing grounds and threshing it. In August, when the wheat ripened, Heilongjiang was in the midst of an intense flood prevention struggle, and the maturity period of this year's wheat was relatively uniform. In order to rush the harvest, in mid-August, Heilongjiang Province mobilized thousands of combine harvesters, tens of thousands of animal-powered harvesters, and more than two million laborers. In addition, city workers, government cadres, troops, and schools in various places vigorously supported the people's communes in their rush harvesting work. After more than half a month of combat, all the ripe wheat in the province was successfully harvested.

    贵州土炼焦厂实行水力洗选
    贵州各土法炼焦厂大搞水力洗选运装一条龙，增产更多的优质焦炭支援钢铁工业。
    这项技术改革，是在已经实现了简易洗煤的基础上进行的。做法是：修好一条水槽，把煤窑旁的积煤场、洗煤槽、筛选机具、精煤沉淀池等连接起来，利用山水或井下水作动力冲击和洗选原煤；原煤经过洗、筛选等工序送入窑中自行脱水，然后点火炼焦，这样就使整个焦炭生产过程通过水力形成了“一条龙”。目前，贵州全省已有百分之九十的土法炼焦厂实现了水力选、运、装“一条龙”。桐梓县石场坝焦厂把人工洗、选、运、装改为水力洗、选、运、装以后，焦炭月产量猛增一倍多。
    天津开展节约煤炭大竞赛
    天津市各行各业广大职工正在开展以巩固、提高、推广煤气化和大力推广循环燃烧为主要内容的“十比”节约煤炭竞赛。这十比是：比煤气化进度和正常运转，比大吃白煤，比降低煤耗，比降低灰中可燃物，比先进技术配套，比安全管理，比改善劳动条件，比综合利用，比技术协作等。为了大力推动节约煤炭工作的进展，最近不少单位交流和推广了三十多项节约煤炭的经验。
    四川加强管理晚秋作物
    八月以来，四川各地利用空田空土和采取间作套作的办法，栽种了秋红苕、秋洋芋、荞子、晚玉米、胡萝卜等十多种晚秋粮食和大量晚秋蔬菜。晚秋作物和秋菜的栽种面积比往年大大增加。四川盆地九、十月份的气温、日照最适于农作物生长，及时抓紧这些晚秋作物的田间管理工作，为争取晚秋作物增产，和促进晚秋作物早熟，以便及时腾地种麦和种油菜等作物都有很大好处。现在，南充、内江、温江等专区，在大抓晚秋栽种的同时，正发动群众通过总结历年晚秋增产经验，制定具体管理措施，组织足够的劳力专门负责晚秋管理。
    黑龙江春小麦收割完毕
    春小麦主要产区黑龙江省的一千四百万亩小麦已经全部收割完毕，正在从地里拉回场院和打场。八月麦熟黑龙江各地正值防汛斗争紧张，而且今年小麦成熟期比较一致。为了抢收，在八月中旬黑龙江全省出动了成千台联合收割机、几万台畜力收割机和二百多万劳动力。此外，各地城市职工、机关干部、部队、学校都大力支援了人民公社的抢收工作。经过半个多月的战斗，全省成熟的小麦就全部拿到了手。
