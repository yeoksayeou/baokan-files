As the Chinese people joyously welcome the eleventh anniversary of the founding of our glorious People's Republic, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, Burmese Chief of Staff General Ne Win, and other distinguished guests of the Burmese government delegation, at the invitation of our Premier Zhou Enlai, have come to our country for a friendly visit and to celebrate the festival with the Chinese people. During this period, the governments of China and Burma will formally sign the historically significant Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. Accompanying Prime Minister U Nu's Burmese government delegation to China to attend our National Day celebrations are a Burmese military friendship delegation, a cultural delegation, a trade delegation, a sports delegation, and a press delegation; also, the Burmese delegation to the Sino-Burmese Boundary Committee, headed by Brigadier Aung Gyi, has already arrived in Beijing. The entire Chinese people warmly welcome the arrival of Prime Minister U Nu, Chief of Staff Ne Win, and other distinguished guests of the Burmese government delegation, and warmly welcome the envoys of peace and friendship sent by the Burmese government and people.

　　This time, the Burmese government and civilian representatives who came to our country for a friendly visit with Prime Minister U Nu numbered more than 370. Such a grand scale, such a wide representation of social life, and such rich and colorful friendly exchanges are not only unprecedented in the history of Sino-Burmese relations, but also a rare occurrence in the history of relations between countries around the world. We fully understand that this is the warm and profound friendship expressed by the Burmese government and the twenty million Burmese people towards the Chinese government and people. The Chinese people sincerely thank Prime Minister U Nu, Chief of Staff Ne Win, and other distinguished Burmese guests for bringing this most precious gift—the sincere and noble friendship of the Burmese people towards the Chinese people—to our National Day.

　　As we welcome the Burmese guests to visit our country, we happily recall the historic event six years ago when our Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister U Nu jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Since our two countries confirmed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the basic norms for handling relations between the two countries, the governments of China and Burma have adhered to the Five Principles, strived to promote friendly cooperation between our two countries, and consulted to resolve the complex issues left over from history between the two countries. The joint efforts of our two governments and peoples have blossomed and borne fruit. Now, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries, whether in political, economic cooperation, or cultural exchange, have achieved tremendous and satisfactory development. On January 28 this year, during General Ne Win's visit to Beijing, the Chinese and Burmese governments signed the Agreement on the Boundary Question Between the Two Countries and the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression Between the Two Countries. Prime Minister U Nu himself has always advocated resolving the Sino-Burmese boundary issue in the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Prime Minister U Nu's visit to China this time will be to formally sign the Boundary Treaty between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma with our Premier Zhou Enlai. We can fully believe that the signing of this treaty will make the Sino-Burmese border permanently a border of peace and friendship, and will bring the friendly relations between China and Burma and the traditional, kinship-like friendship between the two peoples to an unprecedented peak.

　　Asian and African countries suffered from imperialist and colonialist aggression and oppression for a long time. In the long historical era, even close neighbors like China and Burma did not have the conditions to develop friendly and cooperative relations with each other. Only today, after Asian and African countries have successively achieved independence, has the broad prospect of unity and cooperation among the peoples of Asian and African countries emerged. It cannot be overlooked that imperialism, especially American imperialism, is still trying in every possible way to undermine the unity of the peoples of Asian and African countries and implement the vicious policy of using Asians to fight Asians. However, the peoples of Asian and African countries who have newly gained independence from the shackles of imperialism and colonialism deeply understand that developing friendly cooperation between Asian and African countries is inseparable from the fundamental interests of these Asian and African countries in completely shaking off imperialist control and safeguarding and developing their national independence. The Chinese and Burmese peoples firmly support the cause of unity and cooperation among the peoples of Asian and African countries. Recently, when the Congolese people were subjected to aggression by imperialism headed by the United States, the Chinese government and people gave firm support to the just struggle of the Congolese people. On the Congo issue, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu also explicitly stated in a recent speech to the Burmese Parliament that he "recognizes and continues to recognize the Congo as a single country"; and believes that the internal affairs of the Congo "should be resolved by the Congolese people themselves" and that "the outside world, including the United Nations, should not interfere." The Chinese people fully agree with Prime Minister U Nu's above-mentioned stance of supporting Congolese independence and promoting the cause of unity among the peoples of Asia and Africa. Imperialism is also particularly keen on provoking relations between China and Asian and African countries. The further development and consolidation of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Burma cannot but be a heavy blow to the imperialist plot of provocation.

　　In recent years, with the continuous development of friendly relations between China and Burma, the national leaders of our two countries have conducted frequent friendly visits to each other, which has played an extremely important role in promoting the cause of Sino-Burmese friendship. Our Premier Zhou Enlai has paid four friendly visits to Burma since 1954. Most recently, in April this year, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi paid a friendly visit to Burma at the invitation of Prime Minister U Nu and achieved significant results. Every visit by Premier Zhou Enlai to Burma has continuously enhanced the friendship between the Chinese and Burmese peoples. Similarly, Prime Minister U Nu and General Ne Win are both old friends of the Chinese people. They are not visiting China for the first time. This is Prime Minister U Nu's fourth friendly visit to China; this is General Ne Win's third visit to China. Every visit they have made to China has made positive contributions to the development of Sino-Burmese friendship. This visit to China by Prime Minister U Nu, General Ne Win, and other distinguished guests will be magnificently recorded in the history of Sino-Burmese friendly relations due to the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty.

　　Today, the hearts of our two peoples are closer than at any time in history. Since China and Burma each shook off imperialist oppression and achieved independence, the governments and peoples of our two countries have unremittingly devoted themselves to building a friendly mansion between the two countries. Now this mansion is about to hold its completion ceremony. This is not only a great happy event between China and Burma, but also a great happy event between Asian countries. The Chinese people firmly believe that the Sino-Burmese Friendship Mansion is not only the crystallization of the precious friendship between the Chinese and Burmese peoples, but will also have a profound impact on the peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between Asian countries.

### 全中国人民热烈欢迎吴努总理

　　全中国人民热烈欢迎吴努总理
    在中国人民兴高彩烈地迎接我们光荣的人民共和国建国十一周年之际，缅甸总理吴努、缅甸国防军总参谋长奈温将军及缅甸政府代表团其他贵宾们，应我国周恩来总理的邀请来到我国进行友好访问，并同中国人民一道欢度佳节。在此期间，中缅两国政府将要正式签订具有历史意义的中缅边界条约。和吴努总理率领的缅甸政府代表团同来中国参加我国国庆盛典的，有缅甸军事友好代表团、文化代表团、贸易代表团、体育代表团和新闻代表团；还有已经到达北京的中缅边界委员会以昂季准将为首的缅方代表团。全中国人民热烈地欢迎吴努总理、奈温总参谋长和其他缅甸政府代表团的贵宾们的莅临，热烈地欢迎缅甸政府和人民派来的和平与友好的使者们。
    这一次与吴努总理同来对我国进行友好访问的缅甸政府和民间代表多达三百七十余人。规模如此盛大、代表社会生活领域如此广泛和内容如此丰富多彩的友好往来，这不仅在中缅两国的关系史上是空前的创举，就是在世界各国的关系史上也是罕见的盛况。我们完全理解，这是缅甸政府和两千万缅甸人民对中国政府和人民所表示的亲切而深厚的友好感情。中国人民衷心地感谢吴努总理、奈温总参谋长和缅甸其他的贵宾们为我国的国庆所带来的这件最珍贵的礼物——缅甸人民对中国人民的真诚而崇高的友谊。
    当我们欢迎缅甸贵宾们前来访问我国的时刻，我们愉快地回忆起六年以前我国周恩来总理和吴努总理共同倡导和平共处五项原则这一历史性的事件。自从我们两国确认和平共处五项原则作为处理两国关系的基本准则以来，中缅两国政府都信守五项原则，努力促进我们两国的友好合作关系，协商解决两国之间历史上遗留下来的复杂问题。我们两国政府和人民的共同努力已经开花结果。现在我们两国之间的友好合作关系，不论是在政治方面、经济合作方面和文化交流方面，都有了巨大的、令人满意的发展。今年1月28日，在奈温将军访问北京期间，中国政府和缅甸政府签订了两国边界问题协定和两国友好和互不侵犯条约。吴努总理本人从来就主张根据和平共处五项原则的精神来解决中缅边界问题。吴努总理这次来中国访问，将要同我国周恩来总理正式签署中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦的边界条约。我们完全可以相信，这个条约的签订，将使中缅边界永久地成为一条和平友好的边界，将使中缅两国的友好关系和两国人民传统的、亲戚般的友谊达到一个前所未有的高峰。
    亚非国家过去长时期地遭受帝国主义和殖民主义的侵略和压迫，在漫长的历史年代里，即使是像中国和缅甸那样的近邻，都没有条件发展彼此之间的友好合作关系。而只有在亚非各国相继取得独立以后的今天，才出现了亚非各国人民团结合作的宽广前途。不能不看到，帝国主义特别是美帝国主义，仍然在千方百计地企图破坏亚非各国人民的团结，推行用亚非人打亚非人的恶毒政策。然而，新从帝国主义和殖民主义羁绊下获得独立的亚非国家的人民，深深地懂得，发展亚非各国之间的友好合作关系，是同这些亚非国家彻底摆脱帝国主义的控制，维护和发展她们的民族独立的根本利益不可分割的。中缅两国人民都坚决支持亚非各国人民团结与合作的事业。最近当刚果人民遭到以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略时，中国政府和人民对于刚果人民的正义斗争给予坚决的支持。在刚果问题上，缅甸总理吴努最近在缅甸议会的讲话中，也明确地表示“承认而且继续承认刚果是一个单一的国家”；并认为刚果的内政问题，“应由刚果人民自己来解决”，“外界包括联合国不得加以干涉”。中国人民完全赞同吴努总理上述的支持刚果独立和有利于亚非人民团结事业的立场。帝国主义还特别热中于挑拨中国和亚非国家之间的关系，现在中缅两国友好合作关系的进一步发展和巩固，不能不是对于帝国主义挑拨阴谋的一个沉重打击。
    最近几年来，随着中缅两国友好关系的不断发展，我们两国的国家领导人进行了相互间的频繁的友好访问，这对促进中缅友好的事业起了极为重要的作用。我国周恩来总理从1954年以来，已经对缅甸进行过四次友好的访问了。最近一次是在今年4月间，周恩来总理和陈毅副总理应吴努总理的邀请对缅甸进行了友好访问，并且取得了重大的成就。周恩来总理对缅甸的每一次访问，都不断增进了中缅两国人民的友谊。同样，吴努总理和奈温将军都是中国人民的老朋友。他们也都不是第一次来中国访问了。吴努总理这次已是第四次到中国进行友好访问；奈温将军已是第三次来中国进行友好访问。他们每一次对中国的访问，也都在发展中缅友好的事业上作出了积极的贡献。吴努总理、奈温将军和其他贵宾们的这一次访问中国，将由于签订中缅边界条约，而辉煌地载入中缅友好关系的史册。
    今天，我们两国人民的心比历史上任何时候都更加亲近。自从中缅两国各自摆脱帝国主义的压迫，取得独立以来，我们两国政府和人民不懈地致力于建筑两国之间的友好大厦。现在这座大厦就将举行落成典礼了。这不仅是中缅两国之间的大喜事，也是亚洲国家之间的大喜事。中国人民深信，中缅友好大厦不仅是中缅两国人民珍贵友谊的结晶，而且将对亚洲各国之间的和平共处和友好合作发生深远的影响。
