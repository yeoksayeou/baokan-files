    Guinea Is in Its Prime	Zou Difan
    The palms of Africa are green and shady,
    The Republic of Guinea is in its prime.
    Come, the bananas are harvested, the rice ears sway like gold,
    The people of Guinea march forward, march forward!
    Your steps are so strong,
    Because you have independently embarked on the journey,
    Opening roads through mountains, building bridges over rivers,
    Hospitals bandage wounds, schools light the lamp of wisdom.
    Newly opened flower buds greet the morning sun,
    The Republic of Guinea is in its prime,
    The French "Mother" smiles again!
    The American "Father" recites scriptures!
    The people have already dissected the heart of imperialism,
    The "Mother" wants to cut off the orphan's intestines,
    The "Father" wants to strangle the infant's neck,
    The people of Guinea stand up and march forward.
    Remember those days, one hundred and thirty tons of raw materials
    Could only be exchanged for ten tons of finished products,
    Remember the French colonial bank
    Sucking the people's blood dry...
    The key to the motherland must be held in our own hands,
    The people of Guinea stand up and march forward!
    Formulate independent economic development plans,
    Establish the great ambition of self-reliance...
    Struggle ensures eternal youth,
    Friendship is seen in difficulties,
    Your anti-imperialism greatly helps the people who love peace,
    Peace-loving people all over the world support you.
    You open rice fields on the Atlantic coast,
    We build new villages on the Pacific coast.
    Conakry and Beijing,
    Although separated by thousands of miles, our hearts are close.
    Oppose imperialism and safeguard peace,
    The sea and sky are our sworn brotherhood to forge friendship.

    几内亚正当青春	邹荻帆
    非洲的棕榈绿成荫，
    几内亚共和国正青春。
    来呀，香蕉结采，稻穗摇金，
    几内亚人民向前进，向前进！
    你们的步子这么健劲，
    因为你们独立地走上了路程，
    遇山开路、遇水搭桥呀，
    医院包扎创口，学校点智慧的明灯。
    初开的花苞迎朝阳，
    几内亚共和国正青春，
    法国“圣母”又含笑！
    美国“神父”念经文！
    人民已经解剖过帝国主义的心，
    “圣母”要截断孤儿的肠，
    “神父”要掐断幼婴的颈，
    几内亚人站起向前进。
    回想那日子吧，一百三十吨原料
    才换回十吨制成品，
    回想法国的殖民银行
    把人民血髓都吸尽……
    祖国的钥匙要掌握在自己的手里，
    几内亚人站起来向前进！
    订独立发展的经济计划，
    树自力更生的伟大雄心……
    斗争长保青春在，
    困难之中见友情，
    你们反帝给爱和平的人民大帮助，
    全世界爱好和平的人民都支援你们。
    大西洋岸你们开稻田，
    太平洋岸我们建新村。
    科纳克里北京城，
    相隔万里心相近。
    反对帝国主义保和平，
    海天就是我们的金兰谱结友情。
