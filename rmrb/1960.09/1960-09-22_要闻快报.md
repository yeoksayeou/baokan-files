    Jilin Launches Crop Protection and Harvest Security Campaign

    In Jilin's rural areas, a vigorous "Everyone Participates in Crop Protection, Everyone Cherishes Food" campaign has been launched in the movement to increase production and practice thrift, centered on increasing grain production. This is closely integrated with the late-stage management of autumn fields, adopting a method that combines professional teams with mass crop protection. Currently, more than 6,000 specialized crop protection teams (groups) have been organized in various places, effectively preventing the phenomenon of birds, beasts, livestock, and poultry damaging grain.

    Various localities have formulated many necessary crop protection systems. To prevent livestock and poultry from harming crops, many areas stipulate that herders and feeders must strengthen the management of livestock and poultry; when grazing ends, the number of livestock must be checked, and large livestock must wear muzzles during return trips. Many areas have also mobilized the masses to formulate public pledges for protecting crops and cherishing grain, with everyone participating in the crop protection and harvest security campaign.

    Hunan Has Planted More Than Three Million Mu of Autumn Vegetables

    As of September 16, Hunan Province has sown more than three million mu of autumn vegetables. Various places are now seizing the season to continue planting.

    In the rush to plant autumn vegetables, leading comrades of Party committees at all levels in Hunan Province have gone deep into the front line to command, further accelerating the progress of planting. Many commune Party secretaries in the Changde, Xiangtan, and Shaoyang special districts have also established autumn vegetable experimental fields and command fields in production teams and work groups. Furthermore, some brigade Party branch secretaries and experienced vegetable-growing commune members have formed vegetable technology research groups to guide commune members in growing autumn vegetables well.

    Shandong Promotes Nine Types of Sweet Potato Harvesting Plows

    Through experimentation, appraisal, and comparison, the Shandong Provincial Agricultural Machinery Department has finalized nine types of sweet potato harvesting plows and is preparing to promote them widely throughout the province. These plows can be divided into two forms: one is modified from old plows, and the other is modified from seven-inch walking plows by removing the original moldboard and adding a soil-splitting shovel with soil-dividing teeth. Their characteristics are simple structure, low cost, easy to obtain materials, convenient use, good harvesting quality, and high efficiency. Two people and two animals can harvest about fifteen mu in a day, increasing work efficiency by about five times compared to manual digging.

    Xinhui County Increases Planting of Late Autumn Crops

    Xinhui County, Guangdong, mobilized the entire Party and all the people to reclaim wasteland on a large scale to increase the planting of late autumn crops. According to recent statistics, the county has expanded the planting of autumn sweet potatoes and corn to 275,000 mu, which is more than one-third of the county's late rice area and twice the area of autumn-sown coarse grains in the same period last year.

    In this campaign to expand the planting of late autumn crops, all people's communes have made full use of mountainous areas. Except for high mountains with low temperatures and rocky mountains, generally small and medium-sized mountains throughout the county have been reclaimed into sweet potato mountains. Wherever there are flat mountain tops, commune members carry out plowing, build ponds to store water, and open ridges for planting. In addition, commune members also use fruit tree nurseries and vegetable plots to intercrop corn.

    While rushing to plant, various places also attach importance to doing a good job in management.

    吉林农村在以增产粮食为中心的增产节约运动中，紧密结合秋田后期管理，采取专业队与群众护青相结合的办法，开展了一个声势浩大的“人人参加护青，人人爱惜粮食”的护青保收运动。目前各地已经组织起护青保收专业队（组）六千多个，有效地防止了鸟兽、家畜、家禽糟蹋粮食的现象。
    各地制订了很多必要的护青制度。为了防止家畜家禽祸害庄稼，很多地区规定：放牧员、饲养员要对牲畜和家禽加强管理；放牧结束时要查清牲畜头数，大牲畜往返途中一律带兜嘴。很多地区还发动群众订立护青爱粮公约，人人参加护青保收运动。
    湖南已种秋菜三百多万亩
    湖南省到九月十六日止已播种秋菜三百多万亩。现在各地正抢季节继续播种。
    在抢种秋菜中，湖南省各级党委领导同志都深入第一线指挥，更加加快了播种的进度。常德、湘潭、邵阳专区很多公社党委书记还在生产队、作业组建立了秋菜试验田、指挥田，还有的大队党总支书记和有种菜经验的社员组成蔬菜技术研究小组，指导社员种好秋菜。
    山东推广九种甘薯收获犁
    山东省农业机械厅通过试验、鉴定、评比，最后定型九种甘薯收获犁，准备在全省普遍推广。这些犁可分为两种形式，一种是在旧犁上改装，一种是在七吋步犁上改装，将原来犁镜卸去，加上一个带分土齿的入土铲便可使用，其特点是构造简单，成本低，取材容易，使用方便，收获质量好，效率高，二人二畜一天即可收十五亩左右，约比人工收刨提高工效五倍左右。
    新会县增种晚秋作物
    广东新会县发动全党全民大规模开荒增种晚秋作物。据最近统计，全县扩种的秋番薯和玉米已达二十七万五千亩，等于全县晚稻面积的三分之一强，比去年同期秋种杂粮面积扩大了两倍。
    在这次扩种晚秋作物的运动中，各人民公社都充分利用了山地，全县除气温低的高山和石头山以外，一般中小山头都被开垦成为番薯山。凡是平坦的山头，社员们就进行耕翻，建池蓄水，开畦种植。另外，社员们还利用果木苗圃地和蔬菜地间作玉米。
    各地在抢种的同时还重视做好管理工作。
