The key lies in determination
Cheng Pu

After a leading cadre goes deep into the forefront of agricultural production, how should he work, study, and live? The path taken by Comrade Zhao Dingliang, Secretary of the Jiangle County Party Committee in Fujian, provides us with profound enlightenment.

Since 1957, Comrade Zhao Dingliang has been active on the front lines of agricultural production. Taking the Shuinan Brigade of the Chengguan Commune as his base, he shared joys and hardships with the masses, worked alongside them, humbly learned from them, diligently conducted investigations and research, and vigorously summarized and promoted advanced experiences. Under his specific leadership and assistance, the Shuinan Brigade overcame various difficulties and achieved bumper harvests of grain year after year, becoming a red banner in the Nanping Special District. Comrade Zhao Dingliang successfully used the leadership methods consistently advocated by our Party—combining general appeals with specific guidance, participating in production, and leading production—to solve many key problems in the county's agricultural production, powerfully promoting the county's agricultural production.

Some comrades also want to go deep into the front lines of production, but they are often entangled in a myriad of affairs, spending their energy year after year on endless meetings and countless documents, unable to make the determination to go deep into the front lines of production; some, although they have reached the front lines, lack the determination to persevere for a long time. They have a problem in their thinking that has not been thoroughly resolved, which is: will long-term immersion in a base point hinder the leadership of overall work? Comrade Zhao Dingliang's practical experience answers this question well.

Comrade Zhao Dingliang went deep into the Shuinan Brigade, wholeheartedly and in every possible way managing this base point. However, he did not just squat at a point in isolation, but rather "started at the point, with an eye on the whole," breaking through at one point to guide the whole. Although he spent seven to nine months of the year working at the grassroots level, it did not hinder him from leading the county's agricultural production; on the contrary, it was precisely because he went deep into the front lines of production and did a good job of "dissecting the sparrow" that he was able to better guide overall work. The point and the whole are a unity of opposites. Each point has its own particularity; however, the whole is composed of points, and the point and the whole have commonalities. Going deep into the front lines of production, first spending the necessary time "dissecting" a "sparrow" may seem time-consuming, but in fact, it is precisely saving more time. Because familiarity with one point, understanding the laws of one point, makes it easier to understand more points, and easier to understand the entire whole; through the comparison of point and whole, it becomes easier to know which are the special problems of the point, and which are the common problems of the point and the whole, thereby determining different methods for solving problems. In the process of going deep into the front lines of production, Comrade Zhao Dingliang discovered that the contradiction between the excessive concentration of farm work and the shortage of labor during the summer harvest and summer planting period was a key problem related to the success or failure of grain harvests in the Shuinan Brigade and the entire county. He repeatedly consulted with grassroots cadres and commune members, found, and promoted the method of planting a combination of four rice varieties with different maturity periods. With the promotion of this experience, the early and mid-season rice planting area of ​​the Shuinan Brigade expanded by 450 mu in 1958, and the early and mid-season rice planting area in the county also expanded from 35,000 mu to 63,000 mu, which played a significant role in increasing grain production in the Shuinan Brigade and the entire county. In applying the method of combining points and the whole, Comrade Zhao Dingliang was not only good at using the point to "lead" the whole but also paid attention to using the whole to "promote" the point. When he organized inspection work, he always inspected both the point and the whole, so that the point and the whole could promote and reinforce each other. It was precisely because he cleverly used this method of combining points and the whole that he was able to both go deep into the base point and grasp the overall situation, guiding overall work. Of the county's 57 production brigades, he had been to 49 of them, and his footprints could be found in the most remote villages in the county. He knew the 3,000 mu of land in the Shuinan Brigade like the back of his hand and had a comprehensive understanding of the soil properties and crop types in the county. In long-term practice, he accumulated a complete set of experiences in implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture.

How exactly can we go deep into the front lines of production, and how can we successfully lead agricultural production on the front lines? There are questions of working methods, and there are questions of work experience, but the most fundamental thing is the question of determination. As long as we can combine soaring revolutionary drive with a spirit of seeking truth, be down-to-earth, honest, go deep among the masses, rely on the masses, work hard, persevere, and after a certain period of time, we will always have a rich harvest, just like Comrade Zhao Dingliang.

    关键在决心
    程浦
    一个领导干部深入农业生产第一线以后，应该怎样工作，怎样学习，怎样生活？福建将乐县委农业书记赵顶良同志走过的道路，给了我们深刻的启示。
    赵顶良同志从1957年以来，一直活跃在农业生产第一线。他以城关公社水南大队为基点，同群众共甘苦，同劳动，虚心向群众学习，认真作调查研究，大力总结和推广先进经验。在他具体领导和帮助下，水南大队克服了种种困难，连年获得粮食大丰收，成为南平专区的一面红旗。赵顶良同志成功地运用了我们党一贯提倡的一般号召和具体指导相结合、参加生产领导生产的领导方法，解决了全县农业生产上许多关键问题，有力地推动了全县的农业生产。
    有些同志也想深入生产第一线，但是，他们往往为千头万绪的事情纠缠着，终年累月把精力消耗在接连不断的会议和数不尽的文件上面，下不了深入生产第一线的决心；有的虽然到了第一线，却没有决心长期坚持下去。他们思想上有个问题还没有彻底解决，这就是：长期深入基点，到底会不会妨碍领导全面的工作？赵顶良同志的实践经验，很好地回答了这个问题。
    赵顶良同志深入到水南大队，全心全意地、千方百计地经营这个基点。但他不是孤立地蹲点，而是“着手在点，着眼在面”，突破一点，指导全面。虽然他一年有七到九个月活动在基层，但是没有妨碍他领导全县的农业生产；恰恰相反，正是因为深入了生产第一线，做好了“解剖麻雀”的工作，他才能更好地指导全面的工作。点和面是矛盾的统一。每个点都有它自己的特殊性；但是，面是由点构成的，点和面又有共同性。深入生产第一线，首先花必要的时间“解剖”一只“麻雀”，看来很费时间，其实，这正是节约了更多的时间。因为熟悉了一个点，摸清一个点的规律，就便于了解更多的点，便于了解整个的面；通过点和面的比较，就更容易知道哪些是点的特殊问题，哪些是点和面的共同问题，从而确定不同的解决问题的方法。赵顶良同志在深入生产第一线的过程中，发现夏收夏种期间农活过份集中和劳动力不足的矛盾，是关系水南大队和全县粮食收成好坏的一个关键问题，便同基层干部和社员反复商量，找到和推行了四种成熟期不同的水稻品种搭配种植的办法。推广了这个经验，1958年水南大队的早中稻种植面积扩大了四百五十亩，全县早中稻种植面积也由三万五千亩扩大到六万三千亩，这对水南大队和全县的粮食增产起了很大的作用。赵顶良同志在运用点面结合的方法中，不但善于以点“带”面，而且注意以面“促”点。他组织检查工作的时候，总是既查点，又查面，使点面互相推动，互相促进。他正因为巧妙地运用了这种点面结合的工作方法，所以既能深入基点，又能掌握全面情况，指导全面工作。全县五十七个生产大队，他就到过四十九个大队，全县最偏僻的村庄也有他的足迹。他对水南大队三千亩土地了若指掌，对全县的土壤属性和作物种类也有全面的了解。在长期实践中，他积累了一整套贯彻农业“八字宪法”的经验。
    究竟怎样深入生产第一线，怎样在第一线成功地领导农业生产？这里有工作方法问题，有工作经验问题，但最根本的是决心问题。只要能像赵顶良同志那样，把冲天的革命干劲和求实精神结合起来，脚踏实地、老老实实，深入群众、依靠群众，埋头苦干，持之以恒，经过一定时日，总会有丰盛收获的。
