    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 6th: Mitchell and Martin, employees of a highly classified US national security agency, issued a statement at a press conference in Moscow on the 6th, announcing their decision to sever ties with the United States and requesting political asylum from the Soviet government. The Soviet government has granted their request to become Soviet citizens.

    Mitchell read aloud in English the statement he and Martin had written. The original statement remains in locker number 174 at the "Laurel Bank" in Laurel, Maryland. This statement clarifies the reasons for their decision to leave the United States. They carried photographs of this document with them.

    They pointed out that since joining the National Security Agency in the summer of 1957, they had gradually become convinced that "the US government frequently and deliberately fabricates rumors and misleading statements, both in defending its own policies and in denouncing the actions of other countries."

    Mitchell and Martin pointed out that "the US government sometimes secretly uses money and weapons to attempt to overthrow certain governments if it considers those governments unfriendly to the United States." Such actions made them realize that the US government acts unscrupulously, despite often accusing the Soviet government of doing so.

    Mitchell and Martin pointed out that some anti-communists in the United States advocate a pre-emptive war against the Soviet Union. They went on to say that such a war "would, at best, make these people emperors of the churchyard."

    Martin said at the press conference that the US authorities had not published their statement left in the United States, even though they wanted that statement to be seen by the public. He said, "We can only explain this by saying that the Eisenhower-Nixon administration does not want some of its policy actions to be known to the American people."

    Martin and Mitchell said, "It seems that the ring of US military bases surrounding the Soviet Union is intended to show that the US government believes it can effectively combat communist ideology by means of war."

    Mitchell and Martin said that approximately ten thousand people work in the National Security Agency. The central agency at Fort Meade alone has an annual budget of approximately $100 million. The central agency is equipped with a large number of electronic computers. A network of radio eavesdropping stations spans the globe, with more than two thousand listening posts and eight thousand military radio intercept operators. In addition, a large number of operators are engaged in intercepting telex communications. Some intercept units are located on ships and aircraft. However, the main eavesdropping activities are carried out by military radio stations on US bases abroad. The annual cost of the eavesdropping network is approximately $380 million. Including the expenses of the US National Security and Central Agency, the United States spends approximately $500 million annually on telecommunications intelligence.

    According to Mitchell and Martin, the National Security Agency's central agency has four main directorates. The Operations Directorate has several departments responsible for studying the Soviet government's cipher systems and Soviet diplomatic codes, Soviet military codes, Soviet internal codes, the codes and ciphers used by Asian socialist countries, and the codes and ciphers of US allies and neutral countries.

    The US National Security Agency includes the British Special Communications Unit, composed of British personnel. In addition to the United Kingdom, the United States maintains close cooperation with Canada in intelligence matters. Mitchell and Martin pointed out that the United States deciphers the secret communications of more than forty countries (including its allies).

    In answering a reporter's question, Martin said that the United States deciphers the codes of Turkey, France, Italy, Yugoslavia, Uruguay, Indonesia, and the United Arab Republic.

    In answering a question about whether the US radio eavesdropping stations are only aimed at the Soviet Union or also at the countries in which they are located, Mitchell said that the overall US policy is to eavesdrop on the communications of all countries without exception, or, in his words, "equally."

    美国特务机构两职员申请在苏避难并发表声明
    揭露美国到处进行颠覆侵略活动
    他们揭露：美国政府用金钱和武器推翻某些政府、鼓吹对苏联进行先发制人的战争，美国的无线电窃听站网遍布全世界、窃取和研究社会主义国家和其他国家的密码
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科6日讯：美国的一个极其机密的国家安全机构的职员密契尔和马丁，6日在莫斯科举行的记者招待会上发表了声明，宣布已决定同美国断绝关系，并向苏联政府请求政治避难。苏联政府满足了他们要求加入苏联国籍的请求。
    密契尔用英语宣读了他和马丁的声明，这个声明的原本留在马里兰州洛列耳市“洛列耳银行”的第一百七十四号箱子里。这份声明阐明了他们决定离开美国的原因。这份文件的照片他们随身带着。
    他们指出，自从1957年夏季参加国家安全机构的工作以来，他们逐渐确信：“美国政府经常有意识地编造谣言和迷惑人心的言论，无论是在为它自己的政策辩解方面，还是在指责别国的行动方面，都是如此。”
    密契尔和马丁指出，“美国政府有时秘密地利用金钱和武器来企图推翻某些政府，如果它认为这些政府对美国是不友好的话。”这样的行动使他们觉悟到，美国政府行事是不择手段的，尽管它时常这样指责苏联政府。
    密契尔和马丁指出，美国某些反对共产主义的人鼓吹对苏联进行先发制人的战争。他们接着说，这种战争“至多也不过使这些人成为教堂墓地的帝王”。
    马丁在记者招待会上说，美国当局没有公布他们留在美国的声明，尽管他们希望那一声明能让社会公众看到。他说，“对这一点，我们只能解释为：艾森豪威尔—尼克松政府不希望它的政策的某些行动被美国人民知道。”
    马丁和密契尔说，“看样子，包围苏联的美国军事基地包围圈是为了表明：美国政府认为它能够用战争手段有效地同共产主义思想进行斗争。”
    密契尔和马丁说，在国家安全机构里工作的约有一万名工作人员。仅仅弥德炮台的中央机构的经费每年就大约达一亿美元。这个机构的中央机关设有大量的电子计算机。无线电窃听站网遍布全世界，拥有两千多个窃听哨、八千名军事无线电窃听报务员。此外，大批报务员从事窃听电传通讯的工作。有些窃听分队设在船只上和飞机上。不过，主要的窃听活动是由美国国外基地上的军事无线电站进行的。窃听站网每年的经费约达三亿八千万美元。连同美国国家安全和中央机构的经费，美国每年约有五亿美元用于侦察电讯上。
    据密契尔和马丁说，国家安全机构中央机构设有四个主要的管理局。作战局设有若干处，负责研究苏联政府的密码制和苏联外交的密码、苏联军队的密码制、苏联内部使用的密码制、亚洲社会主义国家使用的密码和密码制以及美国的盟国和中立国家的密码和密码制。
    美国国家保安机构包括了由英国人组成的英国特别电讯组。除英国以外，美国还同加拿大在侦察方面保持密切的合作。密契尔和马丁指出，美国读通了四十多个国家（包括它的盟国）的秘密通讯。
    马丁在答复记者的问题时说，美国读通了土耳其、法国、意大利、南斯拉夫、乌拉圭、印度尼西亚和阿拉伯联合共和国的密码。
    密契尔在答复美国无线电窃听站是只对付苏联，还是也对付它们所在的那些国家时说，美国的总政策是窃听一切国家的通讯，一无例外，或者，用他的话说，“一视同仁”。
