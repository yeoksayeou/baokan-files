　　Two years ago in September, the call from the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau's Beidaihe meeting to produce 10.7 million tons of steel spread throughout the cities and villages of the motherland. From the shores of the East China Sea to the foot of the Tianshan Mountains, from both sides of the Pearl River to outside Shanhaiguan, tens of millions of people launched a mass movement to produce steel, developing "small-scale native furnaces" and "small-scale modern furnaces" steel enterprises. It has now been proven that the "small-scale native furnaces" and "small-scale modern furnaces" steel enterprises have unlimited vitality.

　　Two years ago, when we built the first batch of "small-scale native furnaces" and "small-scale modern furnaces" steel enterprises, not everyone realized what an important beginning this was. Today, two years later, looking back at the magnificent scene of tens of millions of people smelting steel across the north and south of the country, inside and outside the Great Wall, we more deeply appreciate that every drop of sweat shed for building furnaces, producing iron, and refining steel was nurturing such a great life. The completion of each blast furnace, the steel production of each converter, and the subsequent transition of each "small-scale native furnace" steel enterprise to a "small-scale modern furnace" steel enterprise, not only made great contributions to completing the national plan at that time, but also opened up a broad road for the high-speed development of socialist construction in our country. This road is the one revealed by the "walking on two legs" policy of simultaneously developing large, medium, and small-scale enterprises proposed by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong.

　　On this road of high-speed development, people are using dragon-flying and phoenix-dancing strokes to depict a thriving construction scene of the steel industry. When the country was first liberated in 1949, there were fewer than twenty enterprises in our country that could produce steel or steel products, including large and small ones. These enterprises were mostly located in coastal areas, and most of the vast and fertile inland areas were "unarmed." When the first Five-Year Plan was completed, although the face of China's steel industry had undergone great changes, there were still twenty provinces and regions out of the twenty-eight in the country that did not produce steel at all or produced very little steel, and there were still sixteen provinces and regions that did not produce iron at all or produced very little iron. At that time, people once thought that it would take ten to fifteen years to solve the problem of the rational layout of China's steel industry. Now, to borrow a sentence from "Ode to the Red Cliff," it is truly "How short the days and months, the landscape is no longer recognizable!" In just two years, except for Tibet, all provinces and autonomous regions across the country have built their own steel industries. There are a total of 1,400 steel enterprises of different sizes; in addition, there are about 3,000 "small-scale native furnace" steel production points, forming a strong steel industry network on the great rivers and mountains of our motherland, covering more than 9.6 million square kilometers. This is the rich and abundant fruit of large-scale steel production two years ago.

　　However, all of this is just the beginning. For the "small-scale modern furnace" steel enterprises with unlimited vitality, it is just a preliminary display of their talent. The splendid future is yet to come. Today, what good news we read in the newspapers! A utilization coefficient reaching two tons, which was once considered impossible for small blast furnaces by some people, but the utilization coefficient of the small blast furnace in the Songzhuang Iron Works of Taiyuan has been stable at around two tons for eight months. All of the pig iron quality is up to standard, which was also once considered very difficult for small blast furnaces by some people, but in the Songzhuang Iron Works, the quality of pig iron has always been up to standard. These advanced banners make us see how vast a world there is in front of the "small-scale modern furnace" steel enterprises. Looking forward to the future, the "small-scale modern furnace" steel enterprises truly have a long way to go and a boundless future.

　　锦绣前程
　　吴滤
    两年前的9月，中共中央政治局北戴河会议关于生产一千零七十万吨钢的号召，传遍了祖国的城市乡村。从东海之滨到天山脚下，从珠江两岸到山海关外，几千万人开展了大办钢铁的群众运动，发展了“小土群”“小洋群”的钢铁企业，到如今已经证明了“小土群”“小洋群”钢铁企业的无限生命力。
    两年前，当我们建设第一批“小土群”“小洋群”钢铁企业的时候，并不是每一个人都意识到这是一个多么重要的开端的。两年以后的今天，再来回顾当时大江南北，长城内外，几千万人大炼钢铁的宏伟的图景，我们才更深刻地体会到，那时候为了建炉、为了出铁、为了炼出钢来所流下的每一滴汗珠，都在培育着一个多么伟大的生命。每一座高炉建成，每一座转炉出钢，以及后来每一个“小土群”钢铁企业向“小洋群”钢铁企业过渡，都不只在完成当时的国家计划中立下了汗马功劳，而且为我国社会主义建设高速度发展开辟了宽广的道路。这条道路就是党和毛泽东同志提出的大中小并举的“两条腿走路”的方针所揭示的道路。
    在这条高速度发展的道路上，人们正以龙飞凤舞的笔触，勾画着钢铁工业一派蓬勃的建设景象。当1949年全国刚解放时，我国能生产钢铁或钢材的企业，大大小小都算上还不到二十个，这些企业大都设在沿海地区，广阔而丰饶的内地大部分地区“手无寸铁”。当第一个五年计划完成的时候，我国钢铁工业的面貌虽然有了很大的改变，但是在全国二十八个省区中，仍有二十个省区根本不产钢或者钢的产量极少，仍有十六个省区根本不产铁或者铁的产量极少。当时，人们曾经以为，要解决我国钢铁工业的合理布局问题，需要十年到十五年时间。如今，借用“赤壁赋”中的一个句子，真是“日月几何，江山不可复识矣！”仅仅两年的时间，除了西藏以外，全国各个省和自治区都建设起自己的钢铁工业。总共有一千四百个大小不同的钢铁企业；另外还有三千个左右的“小土群”钢铁生产点，在祖国九百多万平方公里的大好河山上，构成了一个强大的钢铁工业网。这正是两年前大办钢铁的丰盛硕果。
    然而，这一切都还只是开始。对于具有无限生命力的“小洋群”钢铁企业说来，都不过是锋芒初露。锦绣前程，还在未来。今天，我们从报纸上读到的，都是一些多么好的消息呵！利用系数达到二吨，曾经被某些人认为，对于小高炉说来，是根本不可能的，但是，太原松庄炼铁厂的小高炉利用系数稳定在两吨左右已经达八个月之久了。生铁质量全部合格，也曾经被某些人认为，对于小高炉说来是很困难的，但是，在松庄炼铁厂，生铁质量却一直是全部合格的。这些先进的旗帜，使我们看到，在“小洋群”钢铁企业的面前，还有一个多么广阔的天地。展望未来，“小洋群”钢铁企业真是来日方长，前途无量。
