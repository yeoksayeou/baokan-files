　　Pang Guanxiang's Coal Mining Team Exceeds Production Targets Daily

　　The workers of the Red Flag Coal Mining Team, First Shift, Sixth District of the Fushun Tiger Platform Mine, where national advanced producer Pang Guanxiang works, have adapted to the ever-changing geological conditions of underground operations. They have firmly grasped the three fundamental links to guarantee a substantial increase in coal production: improving work hours, working face, and equipment utilization. They have integrated their existing fourteen major experiences, such as deep drilling, multiple blasting at once, segmented operations, and delivering goods to the blasting site, into a complete system and insist on using them as measures. They also summarize experiences daily by shift, identify weak links, and immediately organize the entire team to overcome them. As a result, from August 28th to early September, the average daily output of the entire team has consistently reached over 1,000 tons, exceeding the planned targets every day. The average recovery efficiency of the entire team reached 7.2 tons. Compared with coal mining teams under the same conditions, the output of one shift equals that of three shifts, and the work efficiency is equivalent to that of two people doing the work of three.

　　Dagu Mountain Mine Improves Equipment Efficiency

　　Since launching the "Ten Thousand Tons Shovel, Ten Thousand Tons Car, Thousand Meters Machine" (electric shovel producing 10,000 tons per day, electric locomotive transporting 10,000 tons per day, drilling machine advancing 1,000 meters per day) competition movement, the workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Dagu Mountain Iron Mine have closely integrated with production and vigorously engaged in technological innovation and revolution. They have realized many reforms in operation and machinery in all mining processes such as drilling machines, electric shovels, and electric locomotives. They have summarized a relatively complete set of advanced operating methods, which greatly improved equipment efficiency, not only promoting current production but also creating conditions for continuously improving ore production capacity. This mine has won the national Red Flag for large-scale open-pit mining for the third time.

　　"Mid-Shift Meetings" Are a Good Way to Promote Production

　　After leading cadres of the Second Iron and Steel Plant of Anhui Province's Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company went deep into the front line of production, they found a good working method to promote the comprehensive completion of shift work plans: "mid-shift meetings." Practice has proved that "mid-shift meetings" have many benefits: they can timely discover and solve some key production problems that cannot be foreseen before the shift, ensuring the comprehensive completion of the shift work plan; they can timely disseminate advanced experience and rapidly improve the technical level of cadres and workers; it is a good form of close integration of political work and economic work, which can better mobilize the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers and promote the in-depth development of labor competition; it can also further change the leadership style. The process of holding "mid-shift meetings" is the process of leading cadres further implementing the mass line and consulting with the masses. Recently, the CPC Ma'anshan Municipal Committee instructed the plant to carefully summarize this experience so that it can be widely promoted throughout the city.

　　Wenzhou City Organizes Fuel Conservation Promotion Group

　　The CPC Wenzhou Municipal Committee of Zhejiang Province transferred cadres, workers, and technicians to form a fuel conservation advanced experience promotion group, focusing on summarizing, matching, and promoting advanced fuel conservation experiences. By the end of August, the city had summarized ten sets of advanced fuel conservation experiences and twenty-eight single-item experiences. The widespread promotion of these advanced experiences has played a significant role in conserving fuel and ensuring increased steel production. For example, after the Wenzhou Power Machine Factory improved the cupola furnace, it increased the finished product rate of castings and reduced the coke consumption per ton of iron by 50%. Recently, they promoted these ten sets of advanced experiences, turning the cupola furnace into a "treasure furnace," further improving the quality of castings and reducing coke consumption by another 10%.

    要闻快报
    庞观祥采煤班天天超产
    全国先进生产者庞观祥所在的红旗采煤班——抚顺老虎台矿六区一班的职工，适应井下作业地质条件多变的特点，狠狠抓住提高工时、工作面和设备利用率等保证煤炭大幅度增产的三个根本环节。他们把已有的深打眼、一次多放炮、分段作业、货接炮送等十四项主要经验配套成龙，作为措施坚持使用；并且按班、按日及时总结经验，发现薄弱环节，立即组织全班工人突破。这样，就使全班生产从8月28日到9月上旬，平均日产量持续达到千吨以上，天天超额完成计划，全班回采效率平均达到七点二吨。和同等条件的采煤班相比，产量实现了一班顶三班，工效达到两人顶三人。
    大孤山矿提高设备效率
    鞍山钢铁公司大孤山铁矿自从开展“万吨铲、万吨车、千米机”（电铲日产万吨、电机车日运万吨、穿孔机日进千米）竞赛运动以来，职工们紧密结合生产大闹技术革新和技术革命，在穿孔机、电铲、电机车等全部采矿工序上实现了许多操作和机具的改革。他们总结出了一套比较完整的先进操作方法，大大提高了设备效率，不仅促进了当前生产，而且为不断提高矿石生产能力创造了条件。这个矿已第三次荣获全国大型露天采矿红旗。
      “班中会”是促进生产的好办法
    安徽省马鞍山钢铁公司第二钢铁厂领导干部深入生产第一线后，找到了一个促进班作业计划全面完成的好工作方法——“班中会”。实践证明，“班中会”的好处很多：可以及时发现和解决班前所不能预料到的一些生产关键问题，确保班作业计划全面完成；可以及时传播先进经验，迅速提高干部、工人的技术水平；它是政治工作和经济工作紧密结合的好形式，可以更好地调动广大职工的积极性，推动劳动竞赛更加深入地发展；它还可以进一步改变领导作风。开“班中会”的过程，就是领导干部进一步贯彻群众路线、与群众同商量的过程。最近，中共马鞍山市委指示这个厂认真总结这个经验，以便在全市普遍推广。
      温州市组织节约燃料促进团
    中共浙江省温州市委抽调干部、工人和技术人员，组成节约燃料先进经验促进团，狠抓节约燃料先进经验的总结、配套和推广工作。到8月底止，全市已总结出十套节约燃料的先进经验，和二十八项单项经验。这些先进经验的普遍推广，对节约燃料，保证钢铁增产起了显著作用。如温州动力机厂改进冲天炉后，提高了铸件成品率，使每吨铁的耗焦量降低50％，最近他们又推广了这十套先进经验，冲天炉成为“多宝炉”，铸件质量进一步提高，焦耗又降低了10％。
