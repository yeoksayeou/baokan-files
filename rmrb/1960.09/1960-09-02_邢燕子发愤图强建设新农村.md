Xing Yanzi, a twenty-year-old female member of the Communist Youth League, whose entire family works in the city, listened to the Party, resolutely stayed in the countryside, united the broad masses of young people, and worked diligently with the people of the whole village to overcome the disaster and made achievements in changing the face of the poor team.

Xing Yanzi's deeds encourage the broad masses of young people to strive to build a new socialist countryside. The Party needs thousands of young people like Xing Yanzi who have broad vision and great ambition.

Among the broad masses on both sides of the Jiyun River in Tangshan City, a very moving story is being told.

The story is as follows: There is a rural educated youth whose entire family works in the city - Xing Yanzi, a member of the Communist Youth League of Sijiazhuang Production Team, Dazhongzhuang Commune, Hangu City, and captain of the "Yanzi [swallow] Assault Team." This twenty-year-old girl, in order to change the face of the poor team, listened to the Party, and was not afraid of the difficulties brought about by last year's severe disaster. She resolutely stayed in the countryside. She was diligent and thrifty, worked hard, united the broad masses of young people, and worked with the people of the whole village to overcome the disaster and made great achievements in developing production. The Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that Xing Yanzi is a good daughter of the Party and a good example for young people, and calls on all Party members, cadres, young people, and the broad masses to learn from Xing Yanzi.

Is She Smart or a "Fool"?

Last autumn, Sijiazhuang suffered from a lixiviation disaster, and most of the team's more than 1,000 mu of crops were submerged. This was the second consecutive year that Sijiazhuang had suffered a disaster. In 1958, the team suffered a major flood, with little harvest. Under the leadership of the Party, the team members overcame the disaster by engaging in sideline occupations. Last year's disaster again resulted in little harvest, and it seemed that there would be no food to eat, and the land was not planted in time for the second year. The Party branch decided to mobilize the members to overcome the disaster and change the face of the poor team.

Late at night, the members' meeting was still going on. Party Branch Secretary Dong Delin discussed solutions with the members. The members knew that it was a critical moment, and they must not lose their energy, but must muster their strength to overcome difficulties.

There were indeed many difficulties in overcoming the disaster. When difficulties were mentioned, some members said, "Our village is so poor, and it has suffered disasters for two consecutive years. The foundation is weak, and there are few laborers. It's hard enough to eat in the winter, let alone talk about a good harvest next year and catching up with the rich teams?" Many members disagreed with this statement, but they could not find a suitable reason to refute these arguments for a while. Several young people who were not very interested in agricultural production took the opportunity to propose going to the city to find work. At this time, Xing Yanzi stood up, her big eyes shining, and looked at the branch secretary and said, "Secretary Dong, I am determined to stay in the countryside and dedicate my youth to changing the poor face of our village and building a new socialist and communist countryside."

Yanzi's attitude had a great impact on people. Because: Most of Yanzi's family members work in the city. Her father is the deputy director of a factory in Tianjin, and her mother also works in a sewing factory in Tianjin. Her uncle and aunt work in a cadre school in Beijing, and her brother works in a factory in Jiangsu Province. Only she and her grandfather are in the countryside. People originally thought that she had convenient conditions to find work in the city, especially in this serious disaster situation, but she resolutely stayed in the countryside, and everyone admired her very much.

Some people couldn't understand why Yanzi did this. Some people said, "Don't look at how determined she is at the meeting, she won't stay for three days and two mornings, she's sure to sneak into the city." Some old ladies also persuaded Yanzi, "You are literate, why are you willing to hold a hoe at home?" At this time, Yanzi's family members outside, hearing that the village had suffered a disaster, also wrote to Yanzi asking her to find work in the city. When Yanzi received the letter, she thought, "The village is really in trouble now. Should I go? Should I not go?" Her thoughts wavered a bit. Comrade Dong Delin, the Party branch secretary, found Yanzi and said, "You are a member of the Communist Youth League. This is the moment when the Party is testing you. To realize our grand ideals, we must not be afraid of difficulties. The greater the difficulties, the more motivated we should be. In this way, difficulties will turn into victories." After listening, Yanzi's determination to engage in agricultural production became even stronger, and she said to Secretary Dong, "You are right, I will definitely remember your words."

Participating in agricultural production was not as simple as Yanzi imagined. Therefore, she was once distressed and shed tears. When she first participated in production, the team assigned her to work as a teacher in the kindergarten. She was unwilling to do it and preferred to participate in field labor. She thought: Although labor is tiring, it is less worrying. But she also thought, this is the task assigned by the Party, and it must be done well. At the beginning, she had no experience in running a kindergarten. More than 30 children were disobedient, running east and west, and arguing at every turn. Yanzi was scolded when she tried to manage them. She thought: This job is not rewarding, I'm always getting scolded, so she went to the branch secretary and asked to participate in field labor. Dong Delin said, "How can that be? You are working as a teacher to encourage more women to participate in labor. The burden the Party has given you is not light! If you don't want to do it just because the children are noisy, what will you do if you encounter big difficulties?" Yanzi thought: That's right, how can I not do it if I encounter such a small thing? I should find ways to overcome difficulties. Later, Yanzi ran the kindergarten well, and the Party branch asked her to hand over the work to others and let her participate in field labor.

Sijiazhuang has few livestock and no machinery, so production is very difficult. Sometimes Yanzi was tired from work and wavered. Her grandfather gave her great encouragement at this time: "It's nothing to be tired from work. Work hard while you're young. If the commune is good, we will be good too." She thought: Grandpa is right, so she mustered her courage again. Yanzi also went to see her father, who took her to visit the factory. She saw so many machines and products like mountains. She was extremely happy for the leapfrog development of socialist construction: How wonderful! I must do a good job in agricultural production in the countryside to support industry. Her father asked her to stay for a few more days, but she refused and returned after a few days.

Yanzi was determined to stay in the countryside. The branch commended Yanzi. Yanzi's father also wrote to Yanzi to encourage her, asking her to resolutely listen to the Party, engage in agricultural production with peace of mind, and be a good daughter of the Party. The encouragement of the Party and the support of the masses made Yanzi even more confident. She actively went to the young people to discuss how to do a good job in production. Some young people who originally wanted to go to the city were also influenced by her and did not want to go out.

The More You Say We Can't, the More We Must Do It

The season for ice fishing arrived. At that time, the key to overcoming the disaster was whether or not we could do a good job in sideline fish production. If we did well, the problem of livelihood could be largely solved, and a foundation could be laid for agricultural production increase in the second year. However, the team could only draw eight male laborers. Many people thought that there were too few laborers to fish. When Yanzi learned about this, she felt that if we did not overcome the disaster, we could not win a great harvest in 1960, and we could not change the face of the poor team. She quietly contacted Communist Youth League members Wang Yongrong, Dong Weizhi, Liu Lianrong, Xing Xiufang, and young women Dong Lifen and others, and proposed to the Party branch to form a women's fishing team.

When the news spread, some people who discriminated against women began to discuss it: "I've never heard of women being able to pull winter nets. Even if there are fish, they will be scared away!" "Just wait and see, they'll freeze and come back when they get on the ice!" Some team members also felt discouraged after hearing these words. Yanzi said, "In order to overcome the disaster, we are not afraid of any difficulties, no matter how great they are. Others think we can't do it, but we must do a good job in production!" Everyone perked up again when they heard this.

The next day, the first women's fishing team in Beida Marsh came to the ice. This was a serious test for Yanzi and her team.

During the coldest days of winter, it was particularly cold to work on the ice. In a short while, their hands and feet were frozen, and everyone didn't know how to do it and felt unsure. Yanzi encouraged everyone while taking the lead. If they didn't know how to do it, they asked, and they did whatever work was tiring. The most tiring job was to make ice holes in the two-foot-thick ice. Yanzi rushed to do it. When water splashed on her body, it immediately turned into ice, but Yanzi ignored it.

The wind grew stronger and the weather grew colder. The more they worked, the more energetic they became. The first net was lowered, and it was time to raise the net. This was a tense moment. Yanzi worked hard to pound the net rope. The net rope froze into an ice stick as soon as it came out of the water, and it was bone-chilling to hold in her hand. Yanzi broke her hand and secretly wrapped it in cloth. Finally, the first net was pulled up, and white fish appeared in front of everyone. The sisters were so happy that they forgot the cold and worked even harder. It was with this tenacious perseverance that Yanzi and the women of the whole team overcame difficulties, learned to fish, and caught net after net of fresh fish.

At this time, the team also found the sideline occupation of making reed curtains, which would also be a large income if done well. However, the members were fishing during the day, and no one was making them. When Yanzi heard about it, she discussed it with her sisters and decided to make reed curtains at night.

At night, Yanzi lit a horse lantern to make reed curtains. Because she was tired from the day's work, she was now sleepy and exhausted, and her chapped hands were aching. Yanzi also wanted to rest. But she felt: I'm tired, and others are tired too. If I don't do it, how will it affect others? How can we overcome the disaster? At this time, she saw Communist Party member Wang Xuejuan, who ran into the house to drink some water when she was sleepy, and came back and shouted: "Sisters, let's do it, drink some water when you're sleepy and you won't be sleepy." Yanzi was very moved when she saw it. She thought: If a Communist Party member can do this, why can't I do this? She breathed on her hands and continued to work, and also encouraged others, telling everyone the stories of Dong Cunrui and Huang Jiguang. After listening to Yanzi's stories of heroes, the women said: Yanzi is working so hard for everyone, even though her hands are frozen like that. We must be like Yanzi. Some old ladies who had never worked before also participated in the production of reed curtains.

This is how Yanzi and the members of the entire production team persisted for three months. The total income from these two sideline occupations of the entire production team was more than 3,900 yuan, and the women's fishing team alone earned more than 2,600 yuan. These two productions played a great role in the entire village's successful overcoming of the disaster. The Party branch commended Yanzi and the women's fishing team at the mass meeting of the whole village. The team was named "Yanzi Assault Team," and the number of members was expanded from seven to sixteen. The entire team unanimously elected Yanzi as the captain.

We Must Grow Wheat Well Even When It's Freezing

The Sijiazhuang Party Branch adhered to the spirit of continuous revolution. After leading the people of the whole village to overcome the winter famine, it decided to lead the people of the whole village to win a great agricultural harvest in 1960.

At this time, the model deeds of the Iron Girls' Team of Xiaoyuzhuang, who had worked hard for a year to catch up with and surpass the rich team, were spread. Yanzi compared herself with the Iron Girls and felt that she had not done enough, so she decided to learn from them. She said: "They were so poor, but they caught up with the rich team in just one year. Sijiazhuang has better production conditions than Xiaoyuzhuang, and we can also catch up with the rich team this year." The members of the Yanzi Team proposed to the Party branch: "We guarantee to play the role of an assault team in changing the poor face of our team. What the Iron Girls can do, we must also do. Wherever the Party points, we will fight there!"

There are two keys for this production team to catch up with the rich team: one is to respond to the call of the higher-level Party and plant spring wheat on 430 mu of dehydrated land and strive for a bumper summer harvest; the other is to increase grain production by reclaiming wasteland. Rushing to plant spring wheat is the most important hurdle. If it is not planted, there will be problems with summer rations; if the sowing time is delayed, it will affect the completion of the wasteland reclamation plan. However, at that time, the team only had three cattle, two of which could not be used, and there were few laborers. It was difficult to finish planting in the dead of winter. The Party branch proposed: Race against time and plant wheat in the coldest days of winter. When some people heard that they were going to plant in the coldest days, they said: "The old people have always planted spring wheat in the early spring. It's freezing cold in the winter. It's a waste of seeds. It's better to eat the wheat seeds." Some also said: "There is a shortage of livestock and a lack of labor. It will be enough to plant 200 mu of spring wheat in the early spring." But Yanzi thought: Of all the conditions, the Party's leadership is the most important; of all the difficulties, relying on the masses is not difficult. There are difficulties in planting spring wheat in the winter, but if everyone thinks of a way, we will definitely be able to plant it well. The members of the Yanzi Assault Team also said: "If the ground is frozen, we will find a way. We will grow wheat even on rocky ground!" They took on the arduous task of rushing to plant spring wheat in the winter.

The ground was still frozen hard. The assault team members of the Yanzi Assault Team threw themselves into battle. When the plow went down, it only plowed up a thin layer of topsoil, and it was impossible to sow seeds. Team member Liu Lianfeng squatted on the ground and dug through the plowed furrows. Thinking and thinking, she suddenly shouted: "Yanzi, I have a solution. Look, the furrows plowed in the morning have thawed a layer of frost at noon. If we plow it again, wouldn't it be deeper?" Yanzi discussed it with the old man who was helping with the plow. The old man said: "It might work, let's try it." Using this method, they plowed it a second time, and the ground was indeed deeper than before. They plowed it a third time. After all, because it was freezing cold, there was still not much soil plowed up, and it was still uncertain whether the seeds could emerge fully after sowing. Yanzi went to consult the old farmers again. The old man Song Liandi originally opposed planting winter wheat, but was very moved when he saw this group of girls working so hard, and came up with the method of applying fertilizer along the furrows after sowing, so as to ensure full emergence of seedlings. This year, these wheat plants are growing very well and have received a good harvest.

Resolutely Turn Wasteland into Granary

When the river opens up after the coldest days of winter, and the wild geese return after the cold has subsided. After planting spring wheat, the struggle to get grain from wasteland was launched.

The team mobilized the members to discuss how to reclaim wasteland. According to the team's wasteland reclamation plan, it was 490 mu. The team had to plant 1,300 mu this spring, and it was already very tight with only three animals. It would be even more difficult to reclaim this wasteland. Some members said: "It is easy to reclaim 290 mu of familiar wasteland, which can be completed this year. It takes a lot of work to reclaim raw wasteland, let's talk about it next year!" Yanzi thought: We are an assault team, and we should take the lead when there are difficulties. Thinking of this, Yanzi stood up and said: "Please give the most arduous task to the assault team. We guarantee to complete the task on time!" Some people said to Yanzi: "This is not as easy as bragging. How much grain can you get from the wasteland you have worked so hard to reclaim?" Yanzi replied: "More grain is harvested for the country, for the commune, and for everyone; if the country has it, the commune has it, then we will have it!"

The seasons do not wait for people. While reclaiming wasteland, the sowing season had arrived. Production became even more tense. Yanzi considered how to arrange the lives of the members so that everyone could have both work and rest. After discussing with the members, it was stipulated that breakfast and lunch should be eaten in the fields, so as to save time and allow the members to rest. Yanzi tried her best to let the team members rest well. When others were resting, she went to carry water and pick up firewood to boil water. As soon as they finished eating dry food, they worked together with the team members again.

The way the Yanzi Assault Team worked boosted the greater enthusiasm of the male members. Male members Wang Xuezhi and others secretly increased their efforts and competed with the Yanzi Team, greatly accelerating the sowing progress, and the wasteland reclamation and sowing tasks were completed on time.

Only Spent Nine Cents

For the sake of the collective cause, Yanzi always proceeded from the collective interest, used the spirit of diligence and thrift of the "Poor Stick Cooperative" to restrain herself, took the lead in production, and was also diligent and thrifty in life, suffering before enjoying.

One day, Yanzi went to the commune to attend a cadre meeting. The team gave her one yuan for food expenses. Yanzi went to the restaurant and did not buy any dishes or soup. She only spent nine cents to buy some food and handed the remaining ninety-one cents back to the team. Someone asked her why she didn't buy any dishes to eat. She said: "The team is still in trouble. If we can spend less, we should spend less." This spring, Yanzi's father sent Yanzi 20 yuan and asked Yanzi to buy some clothes. Yanzi didn't make any clothes. She thought: "When everyone's life is still very difficult, I should also save some money." Coincidentally, the team was short of funds for production, so she voluntarily lent the money she had prepared to make cotton clothes last winter and the money her father had sent this time to the team. When some old ladies found out, they said to Yanzi with affection: "Girl! You have worked hard for the commune for a winter and a spring, and you haven't even made a new cotton-padded jacket. Why don't you buy a piece of clothing!" Yanzi said: "Grandma, I still have clothes to wear now. The team is still in trouble, so let the team use it first."

Sijiazhuang Has Changed

With the Yanzi Team, the whole village has changed. This is the unanimous reflection of the people of Sijiazhuang. Indeed, now the whole village presents a thriving scene everywhere. After the disaster, the team added six animals and purchased diesel engines and small steel mills. In particular, in this year of scarce labor, lack of livestock, and severe drought, it expanded the cultivated area by 490 mu compared to last year and won a summer harvest. People were even happier. Now, in addition to the more than 400 mu of irrigated wheat land in the river bend, the crops in more than 1,200 mu of large fields throughout the team are growing very well, and there is not a single mu of wasteland. The spring-sown sorghum is more than one person tall and is spitting out its ears, which are black and shiny. The paddy rice is like a green sea. People passing by are praising that Sijiazhuang has changed. Now, the members are even more enthusiastic and are strengthening field management in an effort to win an autumn harvest.

After a year of hard work, not only has the face of production changed greatly, but also the thinking of the people has changed greatly. The members recalled that the changes had been so great in just eight or nine months from the disaster relief last autumn to the present, which made them even more confident in the complete transformation of Beida Marsh. The three young people who had left the village have also returned. After Wang Shuhua returned to the village, she was very active in production and has been elected as the deputy captain of the Yanzi Assault Team by the team members. There is also a girl who had gone to Tangshan three times to find work, and now she is determined to stay in the countryside and change the face of Beida Marsh with Yanzi. Male member Song Renqing also ran to the city several times to find work, and none of the team cadres listened to his persuasion. He also came back and said to the branch secretary: "I was wrong in the past. Now I resolutely listen to the Party. Wherever the Party points, I guarantee to do it. I am determined to learn from Xing Yanzi."

Learn from Xing Yanzi

Yanzi's story has not only had a great impact on her commune and Hangu City, but also on other counties in Tangshan City. Learning from Xing Yanzi, catching up with Xing Yanzi, and contributing one's youth to building a new socialist countryside! has become the common slogan of the broad masses of young people. Some factory and mine workers who are linked to the commune have requested to go to the countryside to support agriculture.

Recently, Comrade Ma Li, First Secretary of the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, met with Xing Yanzi and praised and encouraged her. He encouraged her to work hard and diligently and make contributions to the development of agriculture. Yanzi firmly remembered the Party's cordial teachings. She felt that the work she had done for the Party and the people was only the beginning, and more arduous and glorious tasks given by the Party were still waiting for her. In order to completely change the face of her hometown and build a new socialist and communist countryside, she must work harder and make greater contributions to the Party and the people.

Hope the Yanzi Team Will Fly Over the Yellow River and the Yangtze River Soon!

### 邢燕子发愤图强建设新农村

    邢燕子发愤图强建设新农村
    二十岁的女共青团员——邢燕子，全家人都在城市工作，她听党的话，坚决留在农村，团结广大青年，和全村人民在一起，埋头苦干，战胜灾荒，为改变穷队面貌做出了成绩。
    邢燕子的事迹鼓励着广大青年发愤图强地建设社会主义新农村。党需要千千万万像邢燕子那样眼界宽阔而又有雄心大志的青年。
    在唐山市蓟运河两岸的广大群众中，传颂着一个十分感动人的故事。
    故事是这样的：有一位全家人在城市工作的农村知识青年——汉沽市大钟庄公社司家庄生产队共青团员、“燕子突击队”队长邢燕子，这个二十岁的姑娘，为了改变穷队面貌，听党的话，不怕去年严重灾害带来的困难，坚决留在农村。她克勤克俭，埋头苦干，团结广大青年，和全村人民在一起，战胜灾荒，为发展生产作出了巨大的成绩。中共唐山市委认为邢燕子是党的好儿女，青年的好榜样，号召全市党员干部、青年和广大群众向邢燕子学习。
    是聪明还是“傻子”
    去年秋天，司家庄遭受了沥水灾害，全队一千多亩庄稼，绝大部分被淹没了。这是司家庄接连第二年遭灾。这个队1958年遭到一场大水，收成无几，全队社员在党的领导下，搞副业战胜了灾荒。去年这一场灾，又没有多大收成，眼看吃粮就没有着落，第二年地也没及时种上。党支部决定动员社员战胜灾荒，改变穷队面貌。
    深夜，社员大会还在进行着。党支部书记董德林和社员们商量办法。社员知道当时是个紧要的关头，不能泄劲，一定要鼓着一股劲，克服困难。
    要战胜灾荒，困难确实不少。一提到困难，有的社员就说：“咱村这么穷，又连着两年遭灾，底子薄、劳力少，冬天吃的就够呛，还说得上明年丰收和赶上富队？”许多社员不同意这个说法，可是一时又找不到适当理由驳倒这些论调。有几个原来就不大安心农业生产的青年，就乘机提出要到城里去找工作。这时，邢燕子站起来，大眼睛闪闪地望着支部书记说：“董支书，我坚决留在农村，为改变咱村贫穷面貌，为建设社会主义、共产主义新农村，献出我的青春。”
    燕子的态度给了人们很大的影响。因为：燕子的一家人，大部分都在城市里工作，父亲在天津市一个工厂担任副厂长，母亲也在天津市一个缝纫厂作工。伯父伯母在北京市一个干部学校工作，哥哥在江苏省一个工厂工作。只有她和爷爷在农村。人们本来认为她到城市里找工作有方便条件，尤其是在这严重灾荒情况下，她却坚决留在农村，大家都很佩服她。
    燕子这样做，也有个别的人想不通。有的人就说：“别看在会上说的那么坚决，呆不了三天两早晨，准得溜进城里去。”有的老大娘还劝燕子说：“你识文断字的，为什么愿在家里拿锄把？”这时候，燕子在外边的家里人，听说村里遭了灾，也来信叫燕子到城市里去找工作。燕子接到来信，心想：“现在村里也真困难，是去？是不去呢？”思想上有些动摇了。党支书董德林同志知道了，找到燕子说：“你是个团员，这是党对你考验的时刻，要实现我们的远大理想，就要不怕困难，困难越大，我们干劲应该越足，这样，困难就会变成胜利。”燕子听了，安心农业生产的思想更坚定了，就对董支书说：“你说的对，我一定记住你的话。”
    参加农业生产并不像燕子想像的那样简单。因而她也曾经苦恼过，流过泪。刚参加生产的时候，队里派她去幼儿园当教养员。她不乐意干，喜欢参加田间劳动。她想：劳动虽累点，但省心。可是她又想，这是党交给的任务，一定要搞好。一开始办幼儿园没经验，三十多个孩子，不大听话，跑的东的东西的西，有的动不动就吵架，燕子一管就挨骂。她心里想：干这活不讨好，净挨骂，于是去找支部书记，要求参加田间劳动。董德林说：“那怎行？你当教养员正是让广大妇女去参加劳动。党给你这个担子不轻啊！小孩一吵就不想干，再遇见大困难怎办呢？”燕子心里想：对呀，碰见这点小事就不干怎行，有困难就应该想办法去克服。后来燕子把幼儿园搞好了，党支部叫她把工作交给了别人，让她参加了田间劳动。
    司家庄牲口少，没机器，生产很困难。燕子有时候干活累了一些，也曾动摇过，爷爷这时候给了她很大鼓励：“干活累点不算啥，趁着年轻多干点，社好咱也好。”她想：爷爷说的对，就又鼓起了勇气。燕子也曾去看过爸爸，爸爸领她参观过工厂。她看见那么多机器，产品像山一样，她为社会主义建设的飞跃发展高兴得了不得：多好啊！我一定要在农村搞好生产，支援工业。爸爸留她多呆几天，她怎的也不肯，几天就回来了。
    燕子决心留在农村。支部表扬了燕子。燕子的爸爸也给燕子写信鼓励她，要她坚决听党的话，安心农业生产，作党的好儿女。党的鼓励，群众的支持，使燕子的信心更高了。她积极地去找青年们，商量怎样把生产搞好。有的原来想到城市去的青年，受到她的影响，也不想外出了。
    越说咱不行越要干
    冰上治鱼的季节来到了。当时，能不能度过灾荒的关键，就是能不能搞好治鱼的副业生产。搞好了，生活问题可以大部解决，还可以给第二年农业增产打下基础。可是全队只能抽出八个男劳动力，许多人认为劳动力少没法治鱼。燕子知道了这件事，觉得要不战胜灾荒，就不能夺得1960年大丰收，就不能改变穷队面貌。她悄悄地串连了共青团员王永荣、董维芝、刘连荣、邢秀芳和青年妇女董立芬等七个人，向党支部提出组成妇女治鱼队。
    这个消息传开了，有些歧视妇女的人议论起来：“没听说过妇女能拉冬网，有鱼也得给吓跑了！”“看吧，到冰上就得冻回来！”有的队员听了这些话也有些泄气。燕子说：“为了战胜灾荒，困难再大也不怕，别人认为咱们不行，咱们就非把生产搞好了不可！”大家一听，又都鼓起了勇气。
    第二天，北大洼开天辟地头一个妇女治鱼队来到冰上。这是对燕子她们的一次严重考验。
  “三九”天，在冰上干活分外冷，不一会手脚就冻僵了，大家又不知道怎么干，心里都没有底。燕子一面鼓励大家，一面带头干，不会就问，什么活累就干什么。在二尺来厚的冰上打冰洞的活最累，燕子就抢着干。水溅到身上，立刻成冰，燕子也不去理会。
    风越刮越大，天气越来越冷。大家越干越来劲。第一网下去了，就要起网，这是紧张的时刻。燕子用力捣网绳，网绳一出水就冻成了冰棍，抓在手里刺骨寒。燕子把手冻破了，偷偷地用布裹起来。终于，第一网拉上来了，白花花的鱼出现在大家面前，姊妹们高兴地忘了寒冷，干得更欢了。就是凭这种坚韧不拔的毅力，燕子和全队的妇女，战胜了困难，学会了治鱼，捕上来一网网鲜鱼。
    这时，队里又找到了打苇帘的副业，搞好了也是一大笔收入。但是，社员们白天捕鱼，没有人打。燕子听说了，就和姊妹们商量，夜里再打一会苇帘。
    夜里，燕子点上马灯打苇帘。因为一天劳累，现在又困又乏，冻裂的双手，阵阵发疼，燕子也想歇一歇。可是她觉得：我累，别人也累，我要不干，怎么影响别人？怎样战胜灾荒？这时候，她看见共产党员王雪娟，困了跑到屋里喝口水，回来就喊：“姊妹们干哪，困了喝口水就不困了。”燕子看见很受感动。她想：共产党员能这样，我为什么不能这样？她用嘴呵一呵手，又接着干下去，还去鼓舞别人，给大家讲董存瑞、黄继光的故事。妇女们听了燕子讲的英雄事迹说：燕子为了大伙，手冻的那样还干，咱们也得像燕子一样才对。有些从来不干活的老大娘也参加了打苇帘生产。
    燕子就是这样和全生产队社员们坚持了三个月。全生产队这两项副业，共收入三千九百多元，光妇女捕鱼队就收入二千六百多元。这两项生产对全村胜利地度过灾荒起到了很大作用，党支部在全村群众大会上，表扬了燕子和妇女捕鱼队。给这个队命名“燕子突击队”，队员由七个人扩大到十六个人，全队一致选燕子当队长。
    天寒地冻也要种好麦
    司家庄党支部坚持不断革命精神，在领导全村群众战胜冬荒以后，决定领导全村群众夺取1960年农业大丰收。
    就在这时，传来了小于庄铁姑娘队苦干一年赶上超过富队的模范事迹。燕子把自己和铁姑娘作对比，感到自己还作得不够，下决心向她们学习。她说：“人家那么穷，只用一年，就赶上了富队，司家庄生产条件比小于庄还好，也能够在今年赶上富队。”燕子队的队员们向党支部提出：“我们保证在改变本队贫穷面貌中，起突击队的作用。铁姑娘们能作到的，我们一定也要作到，党指到哪里，我们就打到哪里！”
    这个生产队要赶上富队有两个关键：一个是响应上级党的号召，在四百三十亩脱水地里种上春麦，力争夏季大丰收；一个是开荒地增产粮食。抢种春麦是最重要的一关，如果种不上，夏季口粮有问题；如果播种时间拖长，就要影响开荒计划的完成。但是，当时全队只有三头牛，有两头还不能用，劳动力又少，在“七九”里很难种完。党支部提出：同时间赛跑，种“六九”麦。有人听说要种“六九”麦，说：“老辈子都是‘七九’种春麦，‘六九’天寒地冻，白糟蹋种，还不如把麦种吃了呢。”也有的说：“缺牲口，少劳力，在‘七九’里种上二百亩春麦就行了。”燕子却想：千条万条，党的领导是第一条；千难万难，依靠群众就不难。种“六九”麦是有困难，大家来想办法，就一定能种好。燕子突击队队员们也表示：“地冻想办法，是石头地也要种出麦子来！”她们把抢种“六九”麦的艰巨任务担当下来。
    地还冻得棒棒硬，燕子突击队的突击队员们一齐投入了战斗。耠子耠下去，只耠起了一层薄薄的土皮，不能下种。队员刘连凤，蹲在地上扒着耠过的垅沟，想着想着，忽然叫起来：“燕子，有了办法了。你看，上午耠过的沟，中午就化了一层冻，要是再耠一遍，不就深了？”燕子和扶耠子的老大爷商量，老大爷说：“可能行，咱们试试。”用这办法，耠了第二遍，地倒是比过去耠深了，她们又耠了第三遍。终究因为天寒地冻，耠起来的土还是不多，播上种能不能出全苗还是没有把握。燕子又去请教老农，宋连弟老汉本来反对种“六九”麦，但看到这群姑娘这么干，很受感动，想出了播种后顺沟施肥的办法，这样可以保证出全苗。今年，这些麦子长得很好，得到了好收成。
    坚决让荒洼变粮仓
    “七九”河开，“八九”雁来。种完春麦，展开了向荒洼要粮食的斗争。
    队里发动社员讨论怎样开荒。按照队里的开荒计划是四百九十亩。全队今年要春播一千三百亩，只有三头牲畜，种完这些地就已经很紧，要开这些荒，困难更大。有的社员就说：“二百九十亩熟荒好开，今年可以完成。开生荒费工费力气，明年再说吧！”燕子想：我们是突击队，有困难的时候，应该去打冲锋。想到这里，燕子站了起来说：“请支部把最艰苦的任务交给突击队，我们保证按时完成任务！”有的人对燕子说：“这可不像吹气容易啊，你们费劲巴力开出荒来，收了粮食又能分到多少？”燕子回答说：“多收了粮食，是为国家，为公社，为大家；国家有了，公社有了，我们就有了！”
    节令不让人，正开荒，播种季节已到。队里决定边开荒，边播种，生产更紧张了。燕子考虑到怎样把社员生活安排得好，使大家有劳有逸。经过和社员们商量，规定早晨、中午都在地里吃饭，这样省时间，社员又能休息。燕子尽量让队员们休息好，当别人休息的时候，她去担水、拣柴烧开水。刚刚吃完干粮，就又和队员们一起干起来。
    燕子突击队这样干，鼓起了男社员们的更大干劲，男社员王学芝等都暗暗加了劲，和燕子队赛起来，大大加快了播种进度，开荒播种任务按时完成了。
    只花了九分钱
    燕子为了集体事业，总是从集体利益出发，用“穷棒子社”克勤克俭的精神来约束自己，在生产上带头，在生活上也克勤克俭，吃苦在前，享受在后。
    一天，燕子到公社里参加干部会议，队里给了她一元钱的伙食费，燕子到饭馆里，菜、汤什么都没买，只花了九分钱买了点吃食，把剩下的九角一分钱交回队里。有人问她为什么不买菜吃，她说：“队里还有困难，能少花一文，就应该少花一文。”今年春天，燕子的父亲给燕子寄来了二十元钱，叫燕子添置一些衣裳。燕子没有做衣裳，她想：
  “在大家生活还很困难的时候，我也应该节省一些。”正巧队里搞生产缺资金，她就把去冬准备作棉衣的钱和这次父亲寄来的钱，自动借给队里使用。一些老大娘知道了，疼爱地对燕子说：“闺女！你为社苦干了一冬一春，连个新棉袄都没有做，你就添件衣裳吧！”燕子说：“大娘，我现在还有穿的，队里还有困难，就让队里先用吧。”
      司家庄变了样
    有了燕子队，全村变了样。这是司家庄群众的一致反映。的确，现在全村到处呈现出一片欣欣向荣的景象。灾后，队里增添六头牲畜，购置了柴油机、小钢磨。特别是在今年劳力少、牲口缺并且严重干旱情况下，比去年开荒扩种地四百九十亩，夺取了夏季丰收，人们更是高兴。现在全队除了河套里四百多亩一水一麦地以外，全队一千二百多亩大田庄稼长得很好，没荒一亩地。春播高粱，长了一人多高，黑油油的正在吐穗。陆稻像一片绿色的海洋。路过的人都夸司家庄变了样。现在，社员们劲头更足了，正在加强田间管理，力争秋季丰收。
    经过一年来的努力，不只是生产面貌发生了很大变化，人们的思想也发生了很大的变化。社员们回想从去秋抗灾，到现在只短短的八、九个月，变化却这样大，使北大洼彻底翻身的信心更足了。这个村外出的三个青年也都回来了。王淑华回到村里以后，生产很积极，已经被燕子突击队的队员推选为副队长。还有一个姑娘，曾经三下唐山找工作，现在决心留在农村，和燕子一起改变北大洼面貌。男社员宋任清，也几次跑到城市里去找工作，队干部谁劝说也不听，他也回来了，并且向支部书记说：“我过去想错了，现在我坚决听党的话，党指到哪里，我保证做到哪里，坚决向邢燕子看齐。”
        向邢燕子学习
    燕子的故事，不仅在她所在的公社、在汉沽市产生了很大影响，在唐山市其他县也产生了很大影响。向邢燕子学习，向邢燕子看齐，为建设社会主义新农村，贡献出自己的青春！成为广大青年们的共同口号。一些与公社挂钩的厂矿职工，纷纷要求到农村去支援农业。
    最近，中共唐山市委第一书记马力同志，接见了邢燕子，表扬和鼓励了她。勉励她发愤图强埋头苦干，为发展农业立功劳。燕子紧紧记住了党的亲切教导，她感到现在自己为党为人民作的工作，还仅仅是个开始，党给予的更艰巨、更光荣的任务还等待着自己。为了彻底改变家乡面貌，为了建设社会主义、共产主义新农村，要更加努力，为党为人民做出更大的贡献。
    盼燕子队早日飞过黄河、长江！
