    Functionary Personnel "Five Downs to the Front Line"
    The No. 2 Automotive Team of the Lanzhou Municipal Transportation Management Bureau has recently implemented a system of "Five Downs to the Front Line" for leading cadres, office personnel, and logistics personnel (statistics down to the front line, dispatching down to the front line, refueling and water refilling down to the front line, safety inspections down to the front line, and publicity and mobilization down to the front line). These personnel work jointly on the spot, shortening the shift handover time for drivers and increasing vehicle turnover.
    Transportation Department Three Grasps a Day
    In order to accelerate the transportation of coal, iron, ore, and coke, the Chengdu Railway Bureau implemented a method of "three grasps a day." Grasp the plan in the morning, grasp the completion of the plan at noon, and grasp the preparation work for the next day in the afternoon, and solve problems in a timely manner. They also opened up many direct trains. In the first twenty days of August, the bureau opened more than 230 direct trains, transporting much more key materials.
    Quickly Transport Coal to Produce More Coke
    The coke output in the Jining area of Shandong Province has recently increased significantly. The coke output in the entire region in the first ten days of August increased by 32 percent compared to the same period in July, and in the middle ten days of August, it increased by 48.5 percent compared to the first ten days. The quality of coke has also improved significantly. One of the important reasons for achieving this result is to seize the work of coal transportation to ensure that the coke plants have sufficient "food and grass." Railway and other departments organized loading and unloading commando teams to ensure that there is no coal stored at the station, no backlog in the plant, and coke is produced as soon as coal is available.
    Using Powdered Ore to Increase Pig Iron Production
    Since August, the sixteen steel plants in Wuhu City have been vigorously sintering powdered ore. The utilization rate of ore has increased from about 70 percent to 85 percent, which has powerfully promoted the increase in pig iron production. In the first half of August, the city's daily pig iron production increased by 11.3 percent compared to the same period in July.
    "Five-Good" Equipment Competition
    In order to strengthen equipment maintenance, the workers of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant launched a "Five-Good" equipment competition. The five goods are: safe operation without accidents; equipment wiping, lubrication, and cleanliness; early detection of problems, quick solutions, and frequent maintenance; good compliance with operating procedures and good equipment use; and good energy, fuel, and material savings. At the same time, the workers also launched "Red Machine Tool Hand" and "Red Duty Officer" appraisal competitions to more powerfully promote equipment maintenance work.
    Formulating New Machine Operation Regulations
    This year, the Qingdao Railway Station created 224 new machines and equipment. Now, the station is vigorously grasping the promotion of new machines and equipment. In the process of promotion, they have compiled easy-to-understand operating regulations for mechanized, semi-mechanized, and streamlined operations, which have improved the normal utilization rate of new machines and equipment.
    Multiple Uses for One Line, Multiple Functions for One Machine
    Workers at the Harbin Bearing Factory are vigorously upgrading "four transformations." Of the 58 automated production lines and 876 automated single machines that have been developed in the factory, 40 automated production lines have achieved multiple uses, and 864 automated single machines have achieved multiple functions, which has powerfully promoted the leap in production. After completing half of the annual national plan ahead of schedule and fully completing the July national plan, the factory's output in mid-August increased by 16 percent compared to the first ten days of the month.
