    Glorious Achievements
    Sports have class character. In capitalist countries, the working class and the laboring people have no right to participate in sports activities. Only in socialist countries under the dictatorship of the proletariat can the working class and the laboring people participate in sports activities most widely. Since the first day of liberation, Hungary has proposed carrying out mass sports activities. Under the leadership and care of the Party, with the increasing development of socialist construction, sports in Hungary are also developing vigorously.
    In the fifteen years since liberation, Hungarian sports have enjoyed a high reputation internationally. They have made brilliant contributions to socialist sports. Let's take a look at the records created by Hungarian athletes in international competitions in 1959: In 1959, Hungarian athletes participated in the World Championships in twelve sports, winning three championships, ten second places, and seven third places. In the European Championships in eleven sports, they achieved eleven championships, seven second places, and twelve third places. Last year, the Hungarian national team participated in 155 international friendly matches in nineteen sports, winning 79 times and drawing 12 times. Within one year, national athletes broke or created national records a total of 155 times, which means an average of almost once every two and a half days.
    In ball sports, Hungarian football is world-renowned. The Hungarian national football team has played 115 matches with excellent football teams from around the world, winning 82, drawing 16, and losing only 17. Last year, the Hungarian national football team won seven, drew one, and lost only to the Soviet national team by a score of 0-1 in nine matches against European football teams. Particularly sensational in the international sports world was the Hungarian football team's 6-3 victory over the British Royal Football Team, which had maintained its so-called "kingdom of football" for more than 90 years, in London in 1953; then in 1954, they defeated the British team for the second time in Budapest with an absolute advantage of 7-1. Six years later, on May 22nd of this year, the Hungarian national football team defeated the British football team for the third time in Budapest with a score of 2-0. In recent years, a large number of young and excellent football players have grown up in Hungary. This new force will create even better results. Hungary's basketball team is also very strong. Last May, it defeated the world's best Soviet basketball team. At the international tennis tournament held in Budapest last July, Hungarian athletes won four championships in five events. Hungarian table tennis is also famous internationally. They have won eleven men's team championships and nine men's singles championships. In the thirteen national team matches held in the first half of 1959, the Hungarian team won nine times; in the international table tennis tournament held in Budapest in the second half of the year, Hungarian players won three championships and three second places in five events. They have formed a strong table tennis team composed of veterans and newcomers, and are stepping up their training in preparation for the World Table Tennis Championships to be held in Beijing.
    Hungary is also a "nation good at fencing." Now there are more than 4,000 athletes with a very high level of fencing, and they are good at epee. In the twenty-eight World Fencing Championships held since 1904, the Hungarian epee team has won twenty team championships, including eight since 1951. Last year, at the World Fencing Championships held in Budapest, the epee individual championship was also won by a Hungarian athlete. Men's foil and sabre fencers have also been among the top in international competitions since liberation. They won the world team championship in sabre fencing last year. Female fencers are also famous. In the eighteen international competitions since 1932, they have won nine world championships; last year, at the World Fencing Championships, they won the women's team championship again.
    Rowing has also made great strides. Last year, at the international competition held in Poland, they won fourteen championships in fifteen events. In July, they won fourteen first places and eleven second places in two international competitions.
    In track and field, Hungarian athletes have also achieved good results. Last year, they broke the world record in the four-mile relay race; the discus thrower set the European record, approaching the world record.
    In addition, new achievements and new forces are constantly emerging in shooting, handball, swimming, gymnastics, boxing, wrestling and other sports.
    The reason why Hungarian sports can achieve such brilliant results is that the Party attaches importance to the leadership of sports work. The Hungarian National Sports Bureau and the Sports Commission have formulated an outline for sports work during the second Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), which plans to further develop mass sports activities and increase the number of athletes from 10% to 20% of the national population, that is, two million people. Hungarian comrades are happy to say that this is not a mirage, but a completely achievable plan.
    Nationwide Sports
    Extensive mass sports are an inexhaustible source for the continuous development and growth of Hungary's strong sports teams. Carrying out mass sports is precisely the characteristic of socialist countries in developing sports. The broad masses of people in Hungarian cities and villages have a very high interest in sports. Not only young men and women actively participate in sports activities, but also the elderly and children do not lag behind. This is a nationwide movement. There are now more than 6,000 sports organizations throughout the country. More than 2,000 sports organizations have been established in more than 3,300 township units. Factories, state farms, agricultural cooperatives, institutions, and schools all have their own sports organizations. These organizations lead and carry out national sports activities throughout the country and in all walks of life. Sports grounds are everywhere. Well-equipped sports grounds can be seen everywhere in villages, along roads, and in vacant lots in cities and factories. Parents of students are very concerned about enhancing their children's physical fitness. They often organize voluntary labor to help schools build sports grounds. Although the small sports grounds in urban open spaces and beside streets are not large, they are both necessary and convenient for teenagers and children.
    In such a national sports movement, a large number of athletes with considerable levels will inevitably emerge. There are more than one million such athletes in the country, which means that one in ten people is a good athlete. Among them, some are workers, some are farmers, and the most outstanding and talented athletes are constantly supplementing the national sports teams. The young and excellent newcomers of the national football team are mostly selected from the masses; the world-famous discus thrower Szegvari came from a farming family. His best result is 59.6 meters, only 0.31 meters away from the world record; the famous long-distance runner Iharosi is a worker and broke the world record in the 1,500 meters; the famous shot putter Voller is also a worker and ranks among the top in the world shot put record. Many factories have good production and also carry out sports activities well; they produce excellent products and also "produce" excellent athletes. The Ganz Machinery Factory in Budapest has good production and also has a famous basketball team. This team has visited France; the Gottwald Electric Motor Factory has good production, and its women's basketball team is also very famous; the New Pest United Bulb Factory has good production, and there are also many advanced athletes. Carrying out sports activities in production and construction creates conditions for the development of production, ensuring that workers are strong and healthy and better serve production.
    Continuously Improving Politically and Technically
    While extensively carrying out mass sports activities, Hungarian sports organizations attach great importance to improving athletes' political, technical, and sports moral standards, so that they can become well-rounded athletes with high levels. They often educate athletes with socialist ideas, and cultivate their collectivist spirit and revolutionary heroism. Sports schools train a large number of reserves for the sports teams, making athletes skilled, energetic, brave, tenacious, resourceful, and flexible.
    Hungarian sports organizations require all athletes to be advanced producers in factories, advanced workers in institutions, and good students in schools. People with poor moral character and those who do not do well in work, production, or academics cannot become formal athletes or participate in formal competitions. All athletes are required to have strict organization and discipline, a high sense of honor for winning glory for socialism, and to obey the supreme interests of the Party and the state. At the same time, it is also emphasized that coaches should set an example and use their exemplary actions to influence and educate their students. The world-famous discus thrower Szegvari voluntarily went to the countryside to work as a teacher for the needs of the country. Hungarian sports are developing vigorously in this way.

　　蓬勃发展的体育运动
　　胡若木　陈晓东
    光辉的成就
    体育运动也有阶级性，在资本主义国家里，工人阶级和劳动人民无权参加体育活动；只有在无产阶级专政的社会主义国家里，工人阶级和劳动人民才能最广泛地参加体育活动。匈牙利自解放的第一天起，就提出开展群众性的体育运动。在党的领导和关怀下，随着社会主义建设事业的日益发展，全匈体育运动也在蓬勃向前发展。
    解放后十五年来，匈牙利的体育运动在国际上享有很高的声誉。他们为社会主义体育事业作出了光辉的贡献。让我们看看匈牙利运动员在1959年参加国际性比赛中所创造的纪录吧：1959年匈牙利运动员参加了十二种体育项目的世界锦标赛，共获得三个冠军、十个亚军、七个第三名。他们在十一种体育项目的欧洲锦标赛中，取得了十一个冠军、七个亚军和十二个第三名。匈牙利国家队，去年共参加了十九种体育项目的一百五十五次国际友谊比赛，其中胜七十九次，平十二次。一年内，全国运动员打破或创造全国纪录共有一百五十五次，就是说，平均不到两天半就有一次。
    在球类运动中，匈牙利的足球运动是誉满全球的。匈牙利的国家足球队曾和世界上优秀的足球队进行过一百一十五次比赛，取胜八十二场，平十六场，只败十七场。去年，匈牙利国家足球队在与欧洲各国足球队进行的九场比赛中，胜七场，平一场，只以零比一之差输给苏联国家队。特别轰动国际体育界的，是1953年匈牙利的足球队在伦敦以六比三的优势，打败了保持九十多年的所谓“足球王国”的英国皇家足球队；接着1954年又在布达佩斯以七比一的绝对优势，第二次击败英国队。时间过了六年，就在今年的5月22日，匈牙利国家足球队又在布达佩斯以二比零的成绩，第三次战胜了英国足球队。近年来，匈牙利年青的优秀的足球运动员大批成长，这批新生的力量，将会创造更优异的成绩。匈牙利的篮球队实力也很强，去年5月，曾战胜世界上最优秀的苏联篮球队。去年7月在布达佩斯举行的国际网球比赛，匈牙利运动员在五项比赛中夺得四项冠军。匈牙利的乒乓球运动，在国际上也享有盛名。他们曾经获得十一次男子团体比赛冠军，九次男子单打冠军。在1959年上半年举行的十三次国家队之间的比赛中，匈牙利队九次获胜；下半年在布达佩斯举行的国际乒乓球比赛，匈牙利选手在五项比赛中取得三项冠军和三项亚军。他们以老将和新手组成了一支乒乓球劲旅，正在加紧锻炼，准备参加将在北京举行的世界乒乓球锦标赛。
    匈牙利也是一个“善于击剑的民族”，现在全国有四千多运动员具有很高的击剑水平，他们擅长重剑。自1904年起所举行的二十八次世界击剑比赛中，匈牙利重剑队曾夺得二十次团体冠军，其中1951年以来占八次。去年在布达佩斯举行的世界击剑锦标赛中，重剑个人冠军又为匈牙利运动员夺得。男子轻剑和花式剑选手在解放后参加的国际性比赛中，也是名居前列，他们在去年夺得了花式剑比赛团体世界冠军。击剑女将也是名扬四方，自1932年以来十八次国际性的比赛中，她们夺得九次世界冠军；去年世界击剑锦标赛中，她们又夺得女子团体冠军。
    划船运动也突飞猛进，去年在波兰举行的国际比赛中，他们获得十五个比赛项目的十四个冠军。7月份在两次国际比赛中，得了十四个第一名和十一个第二名。
    在田径运动方面，匈牙利运动员的成绩也很好，去年他们打破了四英里接力赛跑的世界纪录；铁饼选手创造了欧洲的最高纪录，接近世界纪录。
    此外，在射击、手球、游泳、体操、拳击、角力等各项运动中，也不断出现新的成绩和新的力量。
    匈牙利的体育运动所以能够取得如此光辉的成就，是由于党重视对体育工作的领导。匈牙利国家体育局和体委制订了第二个五年计划（1961—1965）期间体育工作纲要，计划进一步开展全民性的体育运动，把运动员由全国人口的10％增加到20％，即二百万人。匈牙利的同志们高兴地说，这不是海市蜃楼，这是完全能够实现的计划。
    全民性的体育运动
    广泛的群众性的体育运动，是匈牙利强有力的体育队伍不断发展壮大的无限源泉。开展群众性的体育运动，正是社会主义国家发展体育运动的特色。匈牙利城乡的广大人民，对体育运动都有极高的兴趣，不仅青年男女积极参加体育活动，就是老人、儿童，也不落后。这是一个全民性的运动。现在全国各种体育组织已有六千多个，三千三百多个乡的单位已有二千多个乡成立了体育组织；工厂、国营农场、农业合作社、机关、学校，都有自己的体育组织。这些组织在全国各地、在各行各业中，领导开展全民性的体育活动。运动场遍地皆是，在村头、公路两旁、城市和工厂的空闲地上，到处都可以看见有设备挺好的运动场。学生的家长们，很关心孩子们体质的增强，他们常常组织义务劳动，帮助学校修建体育场。城市空地和街道旁边的小小体育场虽然不大，但是对于青少年和儿童们来说，却是既需要又方便的。
    在这样一个全民性的体育运动中，就必然涌现出大批的具有相当水平的运动员，这样的运动员全国有一百多万，就是说，十个人当中就有一个水平不错的运动员。他们之中，有的是工人，有的是农民，其中最优秀最有才能的运动员，不断地补充国家体育队伍。国家足球队年青的优秀的新手，多数是从群众中挑选的；世界著名的铁饼运动员赛格瓦尼，就是农民出身，他的最好的成绩是五十九点六米，距离世界最高纪录只差零点三一米；著名的长跑运动员伊哈洛西，是工人，曾打破一千五百米的世界纪录；著名的铅球运动员沃尔勒，也是工人，在世界铅球纪录中，名居前列。许多工厂生产好，体育运动开展得也好；生产优良的产品，也“出产”优秀的运动员。布达佩斯的甘兹机械制造厂，生产好，也有一个著名的篮球队，这个队曾访问过法国；哥特瓦尔德电机工厂，生产好，女子篮球队也很出名；新佩斯联合灯泡厂，生产好，先进的运动员也很多。在生产建设中开展体育运动，体育运动又为发展生产创造了条件，保证了工人身强力壮，更好地为生产服务。
    从政治上技术上不断提高
    在广泛地开展群众性体育运动的同时，匈牙利体育组织十分重视提高运动员的政治、技术、体育道德水平，使他们成为具有很高水平的全面发展的运动员。他们经常以社会主义思想教育运动员，培养他们的集体主义精神和革命的英雄主义。体育学校为体育队伍训练大批后备军，使运动员成为技术纯熟、体力充沛、勇猛顽强、机智灵活的干才。
    匈牙利体育组织要求所有的运动员，在工厂里是先进生产者，在机关里是先进工作者，在学校是好学生。道德品质不好，和工作、生产、学业不好的人，都不能成为正式运动员，也不准参加正式比赛。要求所有运动员都有严格的组织性和纪律性，有为社会主义争光的高度荣誉感，服从党和国家的最高利益。同时，也强调教练员以身作则，用自己的模范行动，影响和教育学员。世界著名的铁饼运动员赛格瓦尼，就是为了国家的需要，自愿到农村任教师的。匈牙利的体育运动，就是这样地在提高中蓬勃发展着。（附图片）
