Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, 23rd: The "Movement for the Liberation of Angola" issued a statement today condemning the conspiracies of the US imperialists in the Congo. The statement pointed out that what is currently happening in the Congo is one of the most prominent examples of US imperialists using any means necessary to control the wealth of a country.

　　The statement pointed out that it is well known that the most important companies that exploit the mineral resources of this region of Africa, including the Congo, Angola, Rhodesia, and the Federation of South Africa, are subordinate to the most powerful Wall Street. For example, the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga (which controls the economic lifeline of the Congo) has very close ties with the American Oppenheimer Group, which also controls the Angola Diamond Company, the Rhodesia Trust Company, and other South African companies.

　　The statement further pointed out that US imperialism attempts to give Africans the false impression that it has "no intention of interfering" in the Congo's internal affairs, and therefore uses the United Nations as a guise to conceal and facilitate its activities. Under the cover of this international organization, it constantly plots to create anarchy in the Congo, thereby providing an excuse for "trusteeship" of the Congo, so that they can plunder the resources they control for a longer period.

　　The statement then pointed out that the people of African countries no longer have illusions about the promises of US imperialists. We know that the US delegation's claim in the United Nations that it would take an understanding position on the problems of the people of our countries is an attempt to undermine our unity and another conspiracy to undermine the unity of the people of Asia and Africa. The facts are also very clear, because the imperialist forces gathered around the North Atlantic aggressive treaty are conducting large-scale "military exercises" under the command of their American masters.

　　The statement concluded by pointing out that, faced with the various conspiracies of US imperialists, the African people cannot but regard them as a common enemy and wage a relentless struggle against them everywhere.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, 23rd: The Guinea News Agency published a commentary today condemning the new crimes committed by imperialists in the Congo. The commentary said: Belgian mercenaries carried out bloody suppression in Katanga Province. The massacre in North Katanga is the most brutal massacre that has occurred in the Congo to date.

　　The commentary said: Imperialists—not only Belgian imperialists, but imperialists from other countries—are responsible for this new crime. Imperialists, under the banner of "UN forces," are attempting to perpetuate the reign of terror. There is no doubt that Africa will one day make these executioners pay for their blood debt.

    新华社科纳克里23日电　“争取安哥拉人民解放运动”今天发表声明，谴责美帝国主义者在刚果的阴谋。声明指出，目前在刚果发生的事情是美帝国主义者为了控制一个国家的财富而不择手段的最突出的例子之一。
    声明指出，尽人皆知，剥削包括刚果、安哥拉、罗得西亚和南非联邦在内的非洲这一地区的矿藏资源的那些最重要的公司，都是从属于最有势力的华尔街的。如加丹加联合采矿公司（这家公司控制着刚果经济命脉）就同美国奥本海默财团有着非常密切的联系，奥本海默财团还控制着安哥拉钻石公司、罗得西亚拔萃信托公司和其他南非公司。
    声明进一步指出，美帝国主义企图使非洲人得到它“无意干涉”刚果内政的假象，因而用联合国作为幌子来掩盖和便利自己的活动。它在这一国际组织的掩护下，不断地策划阴谋，来在刚果制造无政府状态，从而为“托管”刚果提供借口，那样他们可以更长期地掠夺他们控制下的富源。
    声明接着指出，非洲各国人民不再对美帝国主义者的诺言抱有幻想。我们知道，美国代表团在联合国声称要对我们这些国家的人民的问题采取谅解的立场，是企图破坏我们的团结，是破坏亚非各国人民的团结的又一个阴谋。事实也非常明显，因为纠合在北大西洋侵略公约周围的帝国主义军队正在它们的美国主子指挥之下进行大规模的“军事演习”。
    声明最后指出，面对着美帝国主义者的种种阴谋，非洲人民不能不把他们当作共同的敌人而在一切地方对他们进行毫不留情的斗争。
    新华社科纳克里23日电　几内亚新闻社今天发表评论，谴责帝国主义者在刚果犯下的新罪行。评论说：比利时雇佣军在加丹加省进行了血腥的镇压。北加丹加发生的屠杀，是迄今在刚果发生的最残酷的屠杀。
    评论说：帝国主义者——不仅是比利时帝国主义者，还有其他国家的帝国主义者——应对这一新罪行负责。帝国主义者打着“联合国军”的招牌，企图使恐怖统治长久保持下去。毫无疑问，非洲有朝一日将使这些刽子手们偿还血债。
