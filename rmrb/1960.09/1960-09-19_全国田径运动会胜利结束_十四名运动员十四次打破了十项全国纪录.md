Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The 1960 National Track and Field Games concluded successfully today. In the afternoon's competition, three more athletes broke two national records, and one relay team tied a national record. As of now, over the past five days, fourteen athletes (nine men and five women) have broken ten national records (seven for men and three for women) fourteen times; two athletes and one relay team have tied three national records. The People's Liberation Army men's team and the Beijing women's team won the men's and women's team titles respectively. The runners-up and third places were the Beijing team and the Hebei team in the men's group, and the Shandong team and the Sichuan team in the women's group.

    The men's high jump final this afternoon was conducted at an unprecedented high level. When the bar was raised to 2.03 meters, Ni Zhiqin, an 18-year-old newcomer from Fujian, who is 1.84 meters tall, cleared the bar with a skilled "straddle" on his first attempt, winning the championship and breaking the national record of 2.02 meters held by Shandong athlete Shi Hongfan. Shi Hongfan, 19 years old and 1.84 meters tall, cleared this height on his third attempt, placing second. Duan Qiyan from Beijing and Kang Junpei from Guangdong both jumped over 2 meters. Chen Zhongyuan from Jiangsu, Yin Keying, a newcomer from Yunnan, and Tao Chenghong from Jiangsu all jumped over 1.95 meters. The eighth-place finisher, Pan Baowei from Jilin, achieved a height of 1.90 meters, while last year's first National Games eighth-place finisher only achieved 1.85 meters, and the champion's result was only 1.97 meters.

    The men's pentathlon also concluded this afternoon. Wang Furong from Shandong broke his own national record of 3,121 points with a score of 3,143 points. His specific scores for the five events were: Long Jump - 6.70 meters; Javelin - 48.03 meters; 200 meters - 22.7 seconds; Discus - 42.26 meters; 1500 meters - 4 minutes 34.3 seconds.

    The Beijing relay team, composed of Zhou Lianli, Xiao Xuelin, Li Fengxiang, and Liang Shiqiang, won the men's 1600-meter relay final with a time of 3 minutes 20.9 seconds, tying the national record for this event.

    The other five final champions this afternoon were: Liang Shiqiang from Beijing in the men's 200-meter low hurdles, 24.2 seconds; Li Henian from Hebei in the men's 3000 meters, 8 minutes 31.6 seconds; Wen Yunzhen from Guangxi in the women's 80-meter low hurdles, 11 seconds; Chong Xiuyun from Jiangsu in the women's shot put, 14.36 meters; and the Shandong team in the women's 800-meter relay, 1 minute 45.3 seconds.

    Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The 1960 National Track and Field Games concluded victoriously today. This sports meet was a fruitful one: over the past five days, 690 track and field athletes competed fiercely in 42 events, with fourteen athletes breaking ten national records fourteen times, and two athletes and one relay team tying three national records. Fifty-seven athletes (34 men and 23 women) reached the Master of Sports standard, and 219 athletes (126 men and 93 women) reached the first-class athlete standard. These facts indicate that our track and field athletes have made significant progress in the year since the first National Games last year. Compared with last year's National Games, the results of the top eight in all 42 events this time have mostly improved compared to the same rankings last year. For example, this time the top eight in the men's high jump all jumped over 1.90 meters, and the top four all jumped over 2 meters, while last year the eighth-place result was 1.85 meters, and the champion's result was 1.97 meters. This time, the top eight in the men's 100 meters all had results within 11 seconds, with the champion's result being 10.5 seconds, while last year only the top two had results within 11 seconds, and the champion's result was 10.8 seconds.

    The rapid progress of young newcomers and the continuous improvement of experienced veterans resulted in many exciting and intense competitions at this sports meet. It was difficult for even those most familiar with the state of track and field in China to predict who would win the championships in many events, reflecting the vigorous development of track and field in our country, with new talent emerging continuously. Zheng Fengrong, who once set a world record in the women's high jump, has been invincible domestically for three years, but this time she was seriously threatened by Wu Fushan, a 17-year-old newcomer from Beijing. Both of them finally jumped over 1.70 meters, with Zheng Fengrong winning only because she had fewer misses. Shi Hongfan, the national record holder in the men's high jump, was a newcomer only familiar to people last year, but this time he was defeated by another newcomer, Ni Zhiqin, an 18-year-old from Fujian, who was not yet well-known. This young athlete only jumped over 1.80 meters last year, but had already jumped over 2.05 meters in early September this year. This time, he and Shi Hongfan both jumped over 2.03 meters, but he succeeded on his first attempt.

    The general improvement in track and field results in various regions was particularly prominent at this sports meet. For example, the champions of all 42 events came from 16 different units. Even the Anhui team, which had never won a championship in a national track and field competition before, this time had Cheng Mingzhao, a 22-year-old long-distance running newcomer, win the men's 10,000-meter championship. Among the 30 units participating in this competition, except for Ningxia and Xinjiang, which had no athletes listed in the top eight of the 42 events, Gansu, which previously scored less frequently in national competitions, this time had one athlete - Zhu Shaotang - win fourth place in the most arduous men's marathon and 5,000-meter races, and two other athletes win fourth place in the men's pentathlon and seventh place in the 3,000-meter steeplechase, respectively. Qinghai also had one athlete - Xun Cunshun - win sixth place in the men's hand grenade throw.

    The results of many veterans participating in this competition have also improved. Nine national record holders broke their own national records. Tian Zhaozhong from Shandong improved his national record in the men's triple jump from 15.82 meters to 16.35 meters, reaching world-class level. Zheng Fengrong improved her own national record in the women's pentathlon from 4,302 points to 4,415 points, and her 80-meter low hurdles result also reached the Master of Sports standard (11.5 seconds), becoming the second female athlete in our country after Jiang Yumin to reach the Master of Sports standard in three sports events. Zhou Lianli, a hurdling expert from Beijing, also became the second "three hurdles" (high hurdles, intermediate hurdles, low hurdles) Master of Sports in our country, following Liang Shiqiang from Beijing. In the preliminary round of the 200-meter low hurdles this time, he passed the Master of Sports standard of 24.5 seconds for the first time with a time of 24.4 seconds.

    全国田径运动会胜利结束
    十四名运动员十四次打破了十项全国纪录
    新华社18日讯　1960年全国田径运动会今天全部结束，在下午的比赛中又有三名运动员打破了两项全国纪录，一个接力队平了一项全国纪录。至此，五天来共有十四名运动员（九男、五女）十四次打破了十项（男七、女三）全国纪录；两名运动员和一个接力队平了三项全国纪录。解放军男子队和北京女子队分别获得男、女团体总分冠军。亚军和第三名，男子组是北京队和河北队；女子组是山东队和四川队。
    今天下午的男子跳高决赛，是在空前的高水平上进行的。当横竿升到两米零三时，福建十八岁、身高一米八十四的新手倪志钦第一次试跳就以熟练的“俯卧式跃过了横竿，赢得了冠军，并且打破了山东选手史鸿范保持的两米零二的全国纪录。十九岁、身高一米八十四的史鸿范在第三次试跳时才越过这个高度，名列第二。北京段其炎、广东康驹培都跳过了两米。江苏陈钟元、云南新手尹可应、江苏陶承洪都跳过了一米九十五。第八名吉林潘宝威的成绩是一米九十，而去年第一届全国运动会第八名的成绩只达到一米八十五，冠军的成绩才达到一米九十七。
    男子五项全能运动也在下午结束，山东王福荣以三千一百四十三分的成绩打破了他自己保持的三千一百二十一分的全国纪录。他的五项具体成绩是：跳远——六米七十；标枪——四十八米零三；二百米——二十二秒七；铁饼——四十二米二六；一千五百米——四分三十四秒三。
    由周连立、萧学林、李凤祥、梁仕强四人组成的北京接力队，以三分二十秒九的成绩赢得了男子一千六百米接力决赛冠军，并且平了这项全国纪录。
    今天下午的其他五项决赛冠军分别是：北京梁仕强的男子二百米低栏，二十四秒二；河北李贺年的男子三千米，八分三十一秒六；广西文蕴珍的女子八十米低栏，十一秒；江苏崇秀云的女子铅球，十四米三六；山东队的女子八百米接力，一分四十五秒三。
    新华社18日讯　1960年全国田径运动会今天胜利地结束了。这次运动会获得了丰收：六百九十名田径健儿五天来在四十二个项目中经过激烈的角逐，有十四名运动员十四次打破了十项全国纪录，两名运动员和一个接力队平了三项全国纪录；有五十七名运动员（男三十四、女二十三）达到了运动健将标准，二百一十九名运动员（男一百二十六、女九十三）达到了一级运动员标准。这些情况说明了我国田径健儿自去年第一届全国运动会以后，一年来又有了长足的进步。如果同去年全运会比较，这次四十二个项目前八名的成绩，大都比去年同名次的水平有所提高。例如这次的男子跳高前八名都跳过了一米九十，前四名都跳过了两米，而去年第八名的成绩是一米八十五，冠军的成绩是一米九十七；这次男子百米前八名的成绩都在十一秒以内，冠军的成绩是十秒五，而去年只有前两名的成绩在十一秒以内，冠军的成绩是十秒八。
    年轻的新手的飞跃进步，有经验的老将的不断提高，使这次运动会出现了很多精彩、紧张的争夺场面。许多项目的冠军属谁，连最熟悉我国田径运动情况的人们都很难预料，这反映了我国田径运动新手辈出、生生不已的蓬勃发展景象。曾经创造女子跳高世界纪录的郑凤荣，三年来在国内所向无敌，但这次却受到了北京十七岁的新手吴浮山的严重威胁，她们两人最后都跳过了一米七十，郑凤荣仅以失误次数较少才赢得胜利。男子跳高全国纪录保持者史鸿范是去年才被人们所熟悉的新手，但这次他却又败给了另一名还不被人们熟悉的新手、福建十八岁的倪志钦。这位年轻的选手去年才跳过一米八十，今年9月初已跳过两米零五。这次同史鸿范都跳过了两米零三，但他是第一次试跳就获得成功的。
    各地田径运动成绩的普遍提高，在这次运动会上表现得十分突出，例如全部四十二个项目的冠军，分别属于十六个单位。连过去从来也没有在全国性田径比赛中取得过冠军的安徽队，这次也由二十二岁的长跑新手程明昭夺得了男子万米冠军。参加这次比赛的三十个单位中，除宁夏、新疆没有选手被列入四十二个项目前八名以外，过去较少在全国性比赛中得分的甘肃，这次有一名选手——朱绍唐获得了最艰苦的男子马拉松比赛和五千米比赛的第四名，另外还有两名选手分别获得了男子五项全能运动的第四名和三千米障碍第七名；青海也有一名选手——荀存顺赢得了男子手榴弹掷远的第六名。
    参加这次比赛的许多老将的成绩也有了提高。有九名全国纪录保持者打破了他们自己保持的全国纪录。山东田兆钟把他保持的男子三级跳远全国纪录由十五米八二提高到十六米三五，达到了世界水平。郑凤荣把她自己保持的女子五项运动的全国纪录由四千三百零二分提高到四千四百一十五分，其中她八十米低栏的成绩也达到了运动健将标准（十一秒五），成为我国继姜玉民后第二个达到三个运动项目的运动健将标准的女运动员。北京跨栏能手周连立也继北京梁仕强之后，成为我国第二个“三栏”（高栏、中栏、低栏）运动健将。他在这次的二百米低栏预赛中，第一次以二十四秒四的成绩通过了二十四秒五的运动健将标准。
