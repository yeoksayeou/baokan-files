　　Anhui Strives for Overall Increase in Late Autumn Crop Production
　　People's commune members in the vast rural areas of Anhui Province are continuing to vigorously manage late autumn grain crops and economic crops in their later stages, striving for an overall increase in autumn crops such as grain, cotton, oil, tea, and tobacco. In the areas along both banks of the Yangtze River and the Huainan region, which mainly produce rice, shallow water and moist irrigation and the application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers have been widely carried out in the later management of double-cropping late rice. This has not only prevented drought but also strengthened the rice stalks, effectively preventing lodging. In the mountainous areas of southern Anhui and the Dabie Mountains, where more wasteland was cultivated and more late autumn crops were planted this year, many commune members were mobilized to go to the mountains to set up camps and fertilize the late autumn crops.
　　While vigorously managing late autumn grain crops, various localities are also vigorously managing cotton and other economic crops.
　　Jiangxi Seizes Final Moment to Manage Autumn Fields
　　Various localities in Jiangxi are concentrating leadership and labor to seize the final crucial moment for managing autumn fields, weeding and applying fertilizer, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of autumn crops.
　　As of the 15th, about half of the double-cropping late rice in Jiangxi Province had been tilled and fertilized three times. Late sweet potatoes, late soybeans, and other miscellaneous grain crops have also been weeded and fertilized once or twice. Autumn crops are growing well. Currently, field management is in the final crucial moment around the "Autumn Equinox." In addition to leaving one secretary to take care of the daily work of the organs, local Party committees and county committees are led by the first secretary to go deep into the fields, divide up areas of responsibility, and lead the masses to further take measures to process and add fertilizer to autumn crops.
　　Recently, autumn fields in some areas of Jiangxi have experienced varying degrees of late drought and pests. Cadres and the masses in these areas are rising up to fight drought and eliminate pests.
　　Guangxi Launches Movement for Low-Yielding Fields to Catch Up with High-Yielding Fields
　　People's communes in rural Guangxi are launching a movement for low-yielding fields to catch up with high-yielding fields. At present, after fertilization and irrigation of the low-yielding fields with a large proportion of third-class seedlings, the proportion of first-class seedlings is rising rapidly. According to statistics from five counties including Guiping and Guixian on September 10, first-class seedlings accounted for more than half of the low-yielding fields, and third-class seedlings dropped to about 12%.
　　These low-yielding fields are generally far from the village, some are scattered in the mountain valleys, and some are newly converted paddy fields from barren dry land, so the seedlings are not as well grown as those near the village. While striving for increased production in high-yielding fields, all localities have concentrated a corresponding number of cadres, labor, fertilizers, and tools to promote low-yielding fields to catch up with high-yielding fields.
　　Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Strengthens the Autumn Harvest Front Line
　　The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is concentrating leadership and labor to strengthen the autumn harvest front line. The number of cadres at all four levels invested in the autumn harvest has reached 170,000, and the labor force has increased from 1.65 million to more than 1.8 million. The progress of autumn harvest and autumn plowing is faster than in previous years, and the area harvested has increased by more than 70% compared with the same period last year.
　　Extensively mobilizing all walks of life to support the autumn harvest is also one of the important measures taken by the Autonomous Region to strengthen the autumn harvest front this year. At present, more than 500,000 cadres from government offices, factory workers, officers and soldiers, teachers and students, and urban residents throughout the region have participated in the autumn harvest.
　　People's Communes in the Suburbs of Beijing Fight Drought and Plant Wheat
　　The broad masses of cadres and commune members in the suburbs of Beijing are vigorously exerting their efforts, giving full play to the superiority of the people's communes and the favorable conditions of water conservancy construction over the years, to fight drought and plant wheat. More than half of the farmland in Fangshan County is dry. Under the leadership of the county party committee, the county has established drought resistance command posts at all levels, and the entire county has organized more than 20,000 people to launch a drought resistance campaign. Currently, 70,000 mu of land have been irrigated to resist drought, more than 300,000 mu have been shallowly cultivated to conserve moisture, and more than 45,000 mu have been planted with wheat.
　　In order to ensure the need for water after wheat planting, areas that are temporarily not dry and can be planted are also starting to dig water sources, block and store water, repair projects, repair and install irrigation machinery, pay attention to leveling the ground and making ridges, and strive to irrigate every piece of wheat.
　　In the tense battle against drought and planting wheat, leading cadres at all levels in the suburbs have gone deep into the front line of wheat planting, working with the broad masses of commune members to find water sources, study measures, participate in drought resistance and rush planting, and specifically solve problems, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the masses.

    要闻快报
　  安徽力争晚秋作物全面增产
    安徽省广大农村人民公社社员，正在继续大抓晚秋粮食作物和经济作物的后期管理，力争粮、棉、油、茶、烟等秋季作物全面增产。主要出产水稻的沿江两岸和淮南地区，在双季晚稻的后期管理中，由于普遍进行了浅水湿润灌溉和追施了磷钾肥，因此，既防止了受旱，又使水稻秸秆健壮，有效地防止了倒伏。今年开荒扩种晚秋作物较多的皖南山区和大别山区，在田间管理中，抽调了许多社员，上山安营扎寨，给晚秋作物中耕追肥。
    各地在大抓晚秋粮食作物管理的同时，也大抓棉花和其他经济作物的管理。
  江西抓最后关头管理秋田
    江西各地集中领导、集中劳力，抓住秋田管理最后紧要关头锄草、追肥，力争秋季作物全面多收。
    江西省到15日止，双季晚稻已有一半左右三耘三追肥。晚红薯、晚大豆等杂粮作物也已锄草、追肥一遍到两遍。秋季禾苗生长良好。目前，田间管理正处于“秋分”前后的最后紧要关头。各地委、县委除留书记一人照顾机关日常工作外，都由第一书记率领干部深入田间，分片包干，领导群众进一步采取措施为秋季作物加工加肥。
    最近以来，江西部分地区的秋田发生不同程度的后期干旱和虫害。这些地区的干部和群众正奋起抗旱、灭虫。
      广西掀起低产田赶高产田运动
    广西农村人民公社正在开展低产田赶高产田的运动。目前，三类禾较多的低产田经过追肥、灌溉，一类禾所占比例正迅速上升。据桂平、贵县等五县9月10日统计，低产田的一类禾已占一半以上，三类禾下降到12％左右。
    这些低产田一般离村子较远，有的分散在山坳之间，还有的是刚由瘠薄的旱地改成的水田，因此禾苗没有近村田长得好。各地在力争高产田多增产的同时，都集中了相应数量的干部、劳力、肥料和工具，促使低产田赶高产田。
      内蒙古自治区加强秋收第一线
    内蒙古自治区集中领导力量、集中劳力加强秋收第一线。全区投入秋收的四级干部已达十七万人，劳力已由一百六十五万人增加到一百八十多万人。秋收、秋耕进度都比往年加快，已收面积比去年同期增加70％以上。
    广泛动员各行各业支援秋收，也是今年自治区加强秋收战线的重要措施之一。目前，全区各地参加秋收的机关干部、工厂职工、部队官兵、学校师生、城市居民已达五十多万人。
    北京郊区各人民公社抗旱种麦
    北京郊区广大干部和社员，正大鼓干劲，充分发挥人民公社优越性和历年水利建设的有利条件，抗旱种麦。房山县有一半以上的耕地干旱，在县委领导下，这个县逐级建立了抗旱指挥部，全县组织两万多人展开抗旱斗争。现已抗旱浇地七万亩，浅锄保墒三十多万亩，种麦四万五千多亩。
    为了保证小麦播种后用水的需要。目前暂时未旱能够播种的地区。也在着手挖掘水源，拦流蓄水，整修工程，检修、安装灌溉机具，注意平地作畦，力争块块小麦都能浇上水。
    在紧张的抗旱种麦战斗中，郊区各级领导干部纷纷深入种麦第一线，同广大社员一起寻找水源，研究措施，参加抗旱抢种，具体解决问题，大大鼓舞了群众的干劲。
