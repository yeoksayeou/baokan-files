Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 25th: TASS reports that Nikita Khrushchev, head of the Soviet delegation to the Fifteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, delivered a lengthy speech during the general debate on September 23rd.

　　The Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers addressed several important issues in modern international political life. He called for the condemnation and cessation of policies of preparing for war and infringing upon the sovereignty of nations, the complete and utter elimination of colonialism, the resolution of disarmament issues, and peaceful coexistence.

　　Khrushchev emphasized that the Soviet government believes that the time has come to raise the issue of the complete and final abolition of all forms of colonial rule, in order to end this shameful, cruel, and barbaric practice. The head of the Soviet delegation announced that the Soviet government is submitting a draft declaration for the consideration of the session, which solemnly proposes the following demands:

　　One, to immediately grant full independence to all colonial countries, trust territories, and other non-self-governing territories, and the freedom to build their national states based on the freely expressed will and desires of the people of these countries.

　　All kinds of colonial systems and colonial administration should be completely abolished so that the people of these countries can independently decide their own destiny and form of government.

　　Two, to eliminate all dominions and leased territories on foreign territories, these strongholds of colonialism.

　　Three, to call on governments to strictly and conscientiously abide by the United Nations Charter and the provisions of this declaration on the equality, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries without exception in international relations, and to not allow any manifestation of colonialism, nor allow any countries to have privileges or superior positions that undermine other countries.

　　Khrushchev condemned the United States and some other countries linked to the United States through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It is precisely because of their position that no progress has been made in resolving the issue of disarmament.

　　Therefore, the Soviet government submitted the disarmament issue to the United Nations General Assembly for consideration, because a considerable number of member states of the United Nations have no interest whatsoever in the arms race and sincerely hope to stop it.

　　Khrushchev said that the Soviet government believes that countries pursuing a policy of neutrality should also be included in the disarmament negotiations.

　　He said that the Soviet government has submitted the "Basic Provisions of the Treaty on General and Complete Disarmament" to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion. He pointed out that the provisions of the Soviet government's proposal submitted to the governments of the world on June 2, 1960, which in many respects catered to the position of Western countries, are the basis of this proposal.

　　Khrushchev said that despite various events that have occurred between the United States and the Soviet Union in the past few months, "the Soviet government remains ready to do everything possible to improve relations between our country and the United States in the future."

　　Khrushchev once again reminded that the Soviet government is "prepared to wait a little longer for the settlement of the German peace treaty issue, in order to try to reach an agreement on this treaty at the summit meeting proposed by the Soviet Union to be convened in the coming months."

　　He expressed hope that the Soviet Union's efforts in this regard would also be supported by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France.

　　Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev emphasized that in order to consolidate peace in the Far East and the world, "it is extremely necessary to solve the Korean issue." He expressed support for the proposal of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on establishing a federation of North Korea and South Korea.

　　Referring to the fact that allies of the United States accuse "us of being overly critical of the US government," Khrushchev said, "Those who pretend to be kind-hearted and pat the international instigator of provocations on the shoulder are doing a disservice to the cause of peace." Appeasement and tolerance of provocateurs will eventually lead to the outbreak of war.

　　Khrushchev emphasized that the flight of American spy planes shows how dangerous the network of American military bases, involving dozens of countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America, is to peace.

　　Khrushchev said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a special "Holy Alliance" of our time, which undertakes an ignoble mission, which is to expel the spirit of freedom everywhere, no matter where this spirit appears.

　　The head of the Soviet delegation called on the United Nations to do everything possible to free Cuba from the threat of foreign interference it faces. Khrushchev said: "If the situation is allowed to reach the point where another Guatemala occurs, it would mean provoking events whose consequences no one can foresee now."

　　Khrushchev compared the Congo incident to the Suez crisis in 1956 and exposed the true basis of the conspiracy against the Congo, which is that monopoly capitalists fear losing the raw materials for nuclear weapons in this country. Khrushchev said that the line of this conspiracy runs from Brussels all the way to the capitals of other major countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Khrushchev said that the situation in which the People's Republic of China has no representation in the United Nations is "a harm to the cause of peace and an insult to the United Nations."

　　He also said that the time has finally come when the Mongolian People's Republic should be admitted to the United Nations. Khrushchev pointed out that the executive bodies of the United Nations, especially the Secretary-General of the United Nations, often stand on the position of a certain group of countries to solve various problems.

　　He said that the time has come to take some measures and create conditions to make the work of the entire United Nations and the work of the executive bodies and working bodies of this organization more perfect.

　　The Soviet government proposes the establishment of a collective executive body of the United Nations to replace the Secretary-General, who is now the sole interpreter and executor of the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. This body will be composed of three people, each of whom will represent a group of countries.

　　Practice has shown that due to the United States' restrictions and infringements on the rights of representatives of the member states of the United Nations, the head of the Soviet delegation believes that another location should be chosen for the headquarters of the United Nations. Khrushchev said, "For example, such a place could be Switzerland or Austria."

　　He added, "If it is considered appropriate to locate the headquarters of the United Nations in the Soviet Union, then we guarantee to give it the best conditions for its work, and guarantee the complete freedom and safety of the representatives of all countries, regardless of their political views, religious beliefs, and skin color."

    赫鲁晓夫在联大发表演说
　　提出一项废除殖民统治的宣言草案；提出“全面彻底裁军条约的基本条款”；表示准备等待一下德国和约问题的解决；提出“极其需要解决朝鲜问题”；号召使古巴摆脱它所面临的外来干涉；揭露了西方国家反对刚果的阴谋；指出中国在联合国没有代表这种状况是对和平事业的危害；应当接纳蒙古人民共和国进入联合国；建议成立联合国集体执行机构来代替秘书长；提出是否应当给联合国总部选择另外一个地址。
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社纽约23日讯：参加联合国大会第十五届会议的苏联代表团团长赫鲁晓夫在9月23日一般性讨论时发表了长篇演说。
    苏联部长会议主席谈到现代国际政治生活中的一些重要问题。他号召谴责和中止备战和侵犯各国人民主权的政策，完全和彻底消灭殖民主义制度，解决裁军问题，和平共处等。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，苏联政府认为，现在已经到了提出完全和最后废除一切形式的殖民统治，以便结束这种耻辱、残酷和野蛮的行径这样一个问题的时候了。苏联代表团团长宣布，苏联政府提出一项宣言草案供会议研究，宣言中郑重地提出如下要求：
    一、立刻给予一切殖民地国家、托管地和其他非自治地区以充分的独立和根据这些国家人民自由表达的意志和愿望建设本民族国家的自由。
    各色各样的殖民主义制度、殖民主义管理都应该完全废除，以便使这些国家的人民有可能独立地决定自己的命运和政府的形式。
    二、消灭一切在别国领土上的属地和租借地这些殖民主义的支撑点。
  三、号召各国政府在国际关系中严格而认真地遵守联合国宪章和本宣言中关于各国一无例外地平等、尊重主权和领土完整的条例，不允许有任何殖民主义的表现、不允许任何一些国家有损害另一些国家的特权或优越地位。
    赫鲁晓夫谴责美国和其他一些通过北大西洋公约组织同美国相联系的国家，正是由于他们的立场，在解决裁军问题方面没有得到任何进展。
    因此苏联政府把裁军问题提交联合国大会审理，因为联合国相当大数量的成员国都对军备竞赛没有丝毫兴趣，并且真诚希望停止军备竞赛。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府认为，现在还应该吸收奉行中立政策的国家参加裁军谈判。
    他说，苏联政府把“全面彻底裁军条约的基本条款”提交给了联合国大会讨论。他指出，苏联政府1960年6月2日提交世界各国政府考虑的建议的条款是这一在很多方面迎合了西方国家立场的建议的基础。
    赫鲁晓夫说，尽管过去几个月中美国和苏联之间发生了种种事件，
  “苏联政府今后仍然准备尽一切办法来改进我国同美国之间的关系”。
    赫鲁晓夫再一次提醒说，苏联政府“准备稍微等待一下德国和约问题的解决，以便试试在苏联建议的将在最近几个月内召开的最高级会议上达成关于这个条约的协议”。
    他表示希望，苏联在这方面的努力也将得到美国、英国和法国政府的支持。
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫强调说，为了巩固远东和世界和平，“极其需要解决朝鲜问题”。他表示支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府关于建立北朝鲜和南朝鲜联邦的建议。
    在谈到美国的同盟者责难“我们对美国政府批评过严时”，赫鲁晓夫说，“假装好心肠的人，卑躬屈膝地拍拍国际挑衅策划者的肩膀，就意味着对和平事业帮倒忙”。对挑衅者的姑息和宽容终将导致发动战争。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，美国间谍飞机的飞行表明，牵连着欧洲、亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲数十个国家的美国军事基地网对和平有多么危险。
    赫鲁晓夫说，北大西洋公约组织是我们时代的特种“神圣同盟”，这个组织承担了一个不高尚的使命，就是到处驱逐爱好自由的精神，不论这种精神出现在什么地方。
    苏联代表团团长号召联合国尽一切努力，使古巴摆脱它所面临的外来干涉的威胁。赫鲁晓夫说：“如果使事态达到再发生一个危地马拉的地步，就意味着会挑起任何人现在难以预料其后果的事件。”
    赫鲁晓夫把刚果事件同1956年苏伊士危机作了比较，揭露了反对刚果的阴谋的真正基础，这个基础就是垄断资本家害怕失去这个国家的核武器原料。赫鲁晓夫说，这个阴谋的线从布鲁塞尔一直通到北大西洋公约组织其他大国的首都。赫鲁晓夫说，中华人民共和国在联合国没有代表这种状况是“对和平事业的危害和对联合国的侮辱”。
    他还说，终于是到了应当接纳蒙古人民共和国进入联合国的时候了。赫鲁晓夫指出，联合国执行机构、特别是联合国秘书长时常站在某一批国家的立场上来解决各项问题。
    他说，采取一些措施、创造条件使得整个联合国的工作和这一组织的执行机构、工作机构的工作更加完善的时候已经到来了。
    苏联政府建议成立联合国的集体执行机构来代替现在是大会和安全理事会决议的唯一解释者和执行者的秘书长，这个机构由三个人组成，每一个人将代表一批国家。
    实践表明，由于美国限制和侵犯联合国各会员国代表的权利，苏联代表团团长认为，是不是应当给联合国总部选择另外一个地址。赫鲁晓夫说，“例如这样的地点可以是瑞士或奥地利”。
    他补充说，“如果认为把联合国总部设在苏联是合适的话，那么我们保证给它的工作以最良好的条件，保证一切国家代表的完全自由和安全，不管他们的政治观点、宗教信仰和肤色如何”。
