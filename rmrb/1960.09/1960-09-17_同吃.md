Eating together is primarily aimed at promoting the fine tradition of hard work and plain living, strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses, and better realizing the Party's leadership over the masses. During the revolutionary war years, our cadres not only fought alongside the masses but also lived with them. When the masses ate chaff and wild herbs, the cadres also ate chaff and wild herbs. Now, the eating conditions have greatly improved compared to the past, but the Party's tradition of hard work, plain living, and complete integration with the lives of the masses has been maintained and carried forward. Eating together, being completely integrated with the lives of the masses, is an important condition for better realizing the Party's leadership over the masses, and it is our Party's glorious tradition. We must always maintain and carry forward this tradition.

Eating together is also aimed at effectively helping the canteens improve their work and manage the lives of the masses well. That is to say, we must both eat in the canteens and manage the canteens. There are currently 3.9 million canteens in rural China. With the consolidation and development of the people's communes, these canteens are also embarking on a path of sound development. However, things are constantly developing. When old problems are solved, new problems will arise. Our cadres, in eating together with the masses, must be good at discovering the problems existing in the canteens, study them carefully, and solve them to promote better and better canteen management. In eating together, we should also make many close friends, listen to their opinions on production, life, and other aspects, publicize the Party's various policies and guidelines, and use the canteen as a position to strengthen the Party's leadership over the masses.

To eat with the masses in the canteen, we must pay attention to eating from the same pot, eating at the same table, and eating according to the local rationing standards. Only in this way can we be integrated with the masses in thought and life, and be as close as family members. Only in this way will the commune members be unconstrained, thinking in their hearts, speaking their minds, saying everything, and offering ideas and suggestions, becoming confidants. If we eat in the same hall but not from the same stove, from the same stove but not the same quantity, or the same quantity but not the same quality, we still cannot truly integrate with the masses, and therefore cannot understand the problems existing in the canteen and help the canteen improve its work; nor can we widely listen to the various opinions of the masses and help improve other tasks.

So, which canteen should the cadres who go deep into the front line eat at? Generally speaking, the cadres who are responsible for a fixed team should eat in the canteen of the team they are responsible for. The cadres who are responsible for a section should work in that team and eat in that team. Canteens that are poorly run have more problems, and cadres should consciously go to these canteens to eat together in order to find the key to the problems and help solve them. Sometimes, in order to summarize advanced experience and promote the backward to catch up with the advanced, we should also go to the better-run canteens to eat together. In addition, we must also go to the canteen regularly to work as administrators, storekeepers, and cooks according to different situations, dissect sparrows, explore experience, and guide the general. At present, in accordance with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, we should educate the masses to establish the idea of diligence and thrift, help the canteen to make a plan for using grain, establish a family fortune, and establish and improve various systems to ensure that the commune members eat frugally, eat their fill, and eat cleanly and hygienically, so as to promote the continuous leap forward in production.

    同吃	桑基
    同吃的目的，首先在于发扬艰苦朴素的优良作风，密切党和群众的关系，更好地实现对于群众的领导。在革命战争时期，我们的干部不但和群众战斗在一起，而且生活在一起。当群众吃糠咽菜的时候，干部也吃糠咽菜。现在，吃的条件比起过去已经有了很大改善，但党的这种艰苦朴素、和群众生活完全打成一片的作风，却一直保持和发扬光大。同吃，和群众的生活完全打成一片，这是更好地实现党对于群众的领导的一个重要条件，这是我们党的光荣传统。我们要永远保持和发扬这一传统。
    同吃的目的，还在于切实地帮助食堂改进工作，管好群众生活。也就是说，既要吃食堂，还要办食堂。我国农村目前有三百九十万个食堂，随着人民公社的巩固发展，这些食堂也走上健全发展的道路。但是，事物总是不断地发展的，旧的问题解决了，新的问题还会出现。我们的干部在和群众同吃中，要善于发现食堂存在的问题，认真研究，予以解决，促使食堂办得好了更好。在同吃中，还应当广交知心朋友，听取他们对生产、生活等各方面的意见，宣传党的各项方针政策，把食堂作为加强党对群众领导的一个阵地。
    到食堂和群众同吃，必须注意和群众吃一锅饭，同桌吃饭，并按当地定量标准吃饭。因为只有这样，才能从思想上和生活上与群众打成一片，亲如家人。只有这样，社员才会无所顾虑，想在心里，谈在口上，无话不说，并为你出主意，想办法，成为知己。假若同堂不同灶，同灶不同量，或者是同量不同质，还是不能和群众真正打成一片，因而就不能洞悉食堂存在的问题，帮助食堂改进工作；也无法广泛听取到群众的各种意见，帮助改进其它各项工作。
    那么，深入第一线的干部，应当到那个食堂去同吃呢？一般说来，固定包队的干部，应当在所包小队的食堂吃饭。包片的干部，应当干在那个小队，吃在那个小队。办得较差的食堂，问题比较多，干部应该自觉地到这些食堂去同吃，以便找出问题的关键，帮助解决。有时为了总结先进经验，推动后进赶上先进，也应该到办得较好的食堂去同吃。此外，我们还要根据不同情况，定期到食堂去当管理员、保管员、炊事员，解剖麻雀，摸索经验，指导一般。目前，应当根据增产节约的精神，教育群众树立勤俭节约的思想，帮助食堂作好计划用粮，建立家底，建立和健全各种制度，保证社员吃省，吃饱，吃得干净卫生，促进生产持续跃进。
