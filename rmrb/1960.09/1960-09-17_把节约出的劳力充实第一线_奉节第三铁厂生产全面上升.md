    Transfer Saved Labor to Strengthen the Front Lines:
    Fengjie No. 3 Iron Plant Achieves Overall Production Increase
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Sichuan Daily News, the Fengjie County No. 3 Iron Plant in Sichuan Province, through technical innovation and the adjustment of labor organization, has strengthened the production front line – the mines – with the labor saved, which has powerfully promoted the rapid increase in the plant's overall production.
    The Fengjie No. 3 Iron Plant has relatively good natural conditions, but the improper allocation of labor and the insufficient supply of raw materials and fuel have seriously affected the plant's production. In mid-July of this year, Hou Rongqing, the First Secretary of the Fengjie County Party Committee, went to the plant to understand this situation. He immediately instructed the plant to fundamentally change its production outlook by vigorously carrying out technical innovation and adjusting labor organization, drawing labor from the second and third lines to support the front lines.
    According to this instruction, the plant's Party Committee immediately launched a vigorous propaganda campaign, emphasizing the importance of mine production and calling on workers to go to the most needed places – the mines. Workers in all workshops and departments immediately responded enthusiastically to the call, launching a movement to go up the mountains and down the wells. The living services department, using the residual water from the blast furnace water turbine, rushed to build three water mills, enabling the automation of all grain processing and extracting 146 strong laborers. The transportation line erected a 600-meter aerial ropeway, changing circuitous transportation to direct transportation and relay transportation to coordinated transportation, saving 265 laborers. The plant leadership implemented a system of contract responsibility divided among the four fronts of mining, coal and coke, smelting, and living services. Cadres worked together in coordinated offices, acting as accountants, cashiers, statisticians, and also living service managers. Thirty-four people were transferred from the forty-one cadres. In just three days, the plant transferred 512 laborers from various departments to go up the mountains and down the wells, increasing the number of mine workers to 68% of the total number of employees. After the front-line strength was strengthened, the production outlook immediately changed. From July 21st to 28th, the average daily output for eight days increased compared to the average daily output from the 1st to the 20th, with ore increasing by 25%, coke increasing by 24%, and pig iron increasing by 16%. By July 31st, the daily output of raw coal almost doubled, coke increased by 42%, and pig iron increased by 84%. For more than a month, production has been steadily increasing.
    For the workers transferred to the mountains and mines, the plant's leadership conducted safety production education in advance and organized old workers to contract and impart technology, mobilizing old workers to give good working faces and good tools to new workers. At the same time, they further arranged the lives of the workers. As a result, the new workers immediately went to the mountains with soaring enthusiasm and plunged into underground production, causing the production of raw coal, coke, and pig iron to rise rapidly.

    把节约出的劳力充实第一线
    奉节第三铁厂生产全面上升
    本报讯　据四川日报消息：四川省奉节县第三铁厂经过技术革新和调整劳动组织，把节约出来的劳动力加强生产第一线——矿山，有力地促进了全厂生产的迅速上升。
    奉节第三铁厂，自然条件比较好，但因劳动力配备不当，原料燃料供应不上，严重影响全厂生产。今年7月中旬，中共奉节县委第一书记侯荣卿深入这个厂了解这一情况后，立即指示通过大搞技术革新和调整劳动组织，从二、三线抽调劳力支援第一线，以便从根本上改变这个厂的生产面貌。
    根据这个指示，厂党委立刻开展了一个声势浩大的宣传运动，大讲矿山生产的重要意义，号召职工到最需要的地方——矿山去。各车间、科室职工立即热烈响应号召，掀起了上山下井运动。生活部门，利用高炉水轮机的余水，赶造了三台水磨，使粮食加工全部实现自动化，抽出了一百四十六名精壮劳力；运输线架起架空索道六百米，改迂回运输为直线运输，改接力运输为联运，节约劳力二百六十五人。厂部领导实行按矿山、煤焦、冶炼、生活四条战线分工包干，干部配套联合办公，既是会计，又是出纳统计，也是生活管理员，在四十一名干部中，抽调出三十四人。仅三天内，全厂从各部门抽出劳动力五百一十二人上山下井，矿山工人上升到占职工总数的68％。第一线的力量加强后，生产面貌立即改观。7月21日到28日，八天的平均日产量比1到20日的平均日产量，矿石上升25％，焦炭上升24％，生铁上升16％；到7月31日，原煤的日产量几乎增加近一倍，焦炭增加42％，生铁增长84％。近一个多月以来，生产情况一直稳步上升。
    对于抽调上山下井的工人，这个厂的领导方面都事先进行安全生产教育，并组织老工人包干传授技术，发动老工人把好的工作面好的工具让给新工人。同时进一步安排好职工生活。这样新工人一上山，立即干劲冲天地投入井下生产，使原煤、焦炭、生铁生产迅速上升。
