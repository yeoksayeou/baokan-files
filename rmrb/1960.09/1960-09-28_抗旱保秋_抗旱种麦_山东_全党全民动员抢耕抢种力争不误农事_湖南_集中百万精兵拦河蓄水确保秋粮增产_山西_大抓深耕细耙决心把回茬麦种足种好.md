Resisting Drought to Protect the Autumn Harvest; Resisting Drought to Plant Wheat
　　Shandong: The entire Party and all the people are mobilized to rush plowing and planting, striving not to miss the agricultural season.
    Hunan: Concentrating a million elite troops to block rivers and store water, ensuring increased autumn grain production.
    Shanxi: Grasping deep plowing and meticulous harrowing, determined to plant enough and plant well the replanted wheat.
    This dispatch from Jinan, September 27th: Shandong is mobilizing the entire Party and all the people, racing against time, to launch a drought resistance and autumn planting campaign, striving to plant enough winter wheat and plant it well in a timely manner. As of the 22nd, the area plowed for autumn reached 15,950,000 mu, and over 5,000,000 mu were planted while fighting drought. Counties and cities with faster progress, and many advanced people's communes, have already finished sowing the early wheat crop and are beginning to seize the opportunity of rainfall to rush planting the late crop.
    Since late August, most areas of Shandong have experienced autumn drought, with the drought situation being more severe in Zibo, Liaocheng, Yantai, Changwei, and Jinan, severely affecting autumn sowing. The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a notice to the entire Party and all the people to resist drought and plant wheat, calling on Party committees at all levels to further mobilize the masses, overcome difficulties, and defeat the autumn drought, striving to plant enough wheat and plant it well in a timely manner. All localities enthusiastically responded to the Party's call and have mobilized superior forces to participate in the drought resistance struggle. The Zibo and Liaocheng regions have formed a million-strong drought resistance army, adopting the method of bringing water from wells, rivers, reservoirs, ponds, and pits back to the fields, and using all kinds of water conservancy tools to rush drought resistance and planting. Shouzhang, Wudi, Gaomi, Linqing and other counties and cities, and many people's communes with relatively abundant water sources, have already finished sowing the early wheat crop and are beginning to rush plant the late crop.
    From the 25th to the 26th, most counties and cities in the province began to receive rainfall, and the drought situation has eased. However, this year's autumn harvest of sweet potatoes is large, and there are many late autumn plantings, with harvesting and planting squeezed together, making agricultural work heavy. In autumn plowing and planting, most agencies, schools, and military units at all levels have suspended work, classes, and drills to go all out to participate in autumn planting. Before the beginning of September, leadership organs at the provincial, regional, and county levels had already dispatched 80,000 cadres to the grassroots level. Factories, enterprises, and transportation departments have also dispatched labor, vehicles, and horses to participate in autumn planting.
    For counties (cities), communes, and teams with heavy autumn planting tasks and greater difficulties, support and large-scale collaboration are carried out in terms of labor, animal power, machinery, and tools. The Liaocheng region organized more than 9,800 cadres from the county to the commune level to go deep into key areas to help with rushing plowing and planting. Linqing City mobilized all factories, agencies, enterprises, and schools in the city, dispatched more than 5,630 employees, carrying a large number of machines, vehicles, and farm tools, to 71 units with large wheat planting tasks to help with autumn planting, watering 6,500 mu of land, plowing 1,500 mu of land, and sowing 2,170 mu of land in three days. Many cotton-growing communes and teams and grain-growing communes and teams in this city also adopted the method of exchanging labor for labor and paying fixed prices, based on their respective characteristics, to organize collaborative support.

    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Since the beginning of autumn, all parts of Hunan Province have mobilized 1.2 million elite troops to launch a fierce struggle against the autumn drought, ensuring a bumper autumn grain harvest. According to incomplete statistics, in the recent period, drought-stricken areas, after all kinds of efforts to broaden water sources and persist in drought resistance, have lifted the threat of drought from one-seventh of the drought-stricken area.

    The characteristic of the autumn drought in Hunan is mainly the interspersed situation. The areas with larger areas of crops affected by drought in the province are mainly in the Changde, Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Xiangtan, and Shaoyang regions. All localities have concentrated superior forces to fight a major annihilation war against drought. In lakeside and riverside areas, where water sources are generally not lacking, waterwheels are generally used to irrigate fields, rivers are blocked and dams are built, and mechanical irrigation is used; in hilly and plain areas far from water sources or where ponds have dried up, canals are generally opened to draw water, wells are dug to draw water, waterwheels are used to irrigate fields, and water is carried to sprinkle seedlings. More than 60,000 mu of single-season late rice and double-season late rice in the severely drought-stricken Xiqiaohe Commune in Yiyang were 75% affected by drought. The entire commune started 14 water pumps, erected more than 1,500 waterwheels, and irrigated day and night with manpower, vehicles, and machines. At the same time, more than 3,000 wells were dug, and water was carried to splash seedlings, so that all drought-stricken late rice was irrigated. More than 1,000 workers at the Xiangyin Quyuan Farm fought for three days, cutting off the Miluo River in the middle, so that the river water obediently flowed into the dam, completely solving the water source problem for 4,667 mu of late rice and 4,185 mu of dry land crops, and making all irrigation self-flowing.
    In order to make reservoirs, ponds, dams, etc. give full play to their irrigation benefits, all localities have given full play to the power of the people's communes with their large scale and high degree of public ownership, vigorously promoting the spirit of collaboration, unified planning of water sources, and trying to conserve water as much as possible without wasting a drop. The Ruyi and other seven brigades of the Zhimushan Commune in Shaoyang had surplus water, while the Gaogongqiao and Baidi and other eight brigades lacked water. They adopted the principle of "irrigating nearby, using water reasonably," taking the method of irrigating from far to near, from high to low, from urgent to slow, from active to passive, and supplementing deficiencies with surpluses, adjusting the irrigation system and solving the irrigation problem for 7,811 mu of paddy fields, and realizing self-flowing irrigation.

    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Many areas of Shanxi Province are resisting drought and planting wheat.

    This year's wheat sowing work in the Jinzhong area has been carried out faster and better than in any previous year. In just ten days from the beginning of sowing, more than 1.36 million mu were sown. Just at this critical juncture, most areas of the region were severely threatened by autumn drought. In addition, this year's wheat replanting area is large (the replanting area accounts for more than half of the plan in the entire region), and it is squeezed together with the autumn harvest. Therefore, the commune members in the entire region actively responded to the call of the regional party committee and launched a vigorous shock movement to resist drought and plant wheat. The number of people engaged in drought resistance and wheat planting has increased from 320,000 to more than 440,000, the number of animal power has increased from 100,000 to more than 125,000, and the daily sowing progress has increased from 100,000 mu to 160,000 mu.
    The 800,000 mu of first-crop wheat in the Jindongnan area have basically been sown. Drought has been encountered in planting replanted wheat. For example, in Tunchang County, the moisture content of general corn fields is about 17%, the moisture content of millet fields is 13%, and the moisture content of vegetable fields is even less, 10%-11%. The people of the entire region have taken emergency action, trying every possible means to deeply plow, finely plow, harrow more, and rake more, to preserve moisture and sow, determined to defeat the drought demon and plant replanted wheat well. According to statistics on September 16, the area of wheat sown in the entire region has reached more than 990,000 mu, of which 216,000 mu are replanted, accounting for 13.4% of the replanted wheat, and the quality of sowing is generally good.

　　抗旱保秋　抗旱种麦
　  山东　全党全民动员抢耕抢种力争不误农事
    湖南　集中百万精兵拦河蓄水确保秋粮增产
    山西　大抓深耕细耙决心把回茬麦种足种好
    本报济南27日电　山东全党全民总动员，争分夺秒，开展抗旱秋种运动，力争适时种足种好冬小麦。截至22日统计，秋耕面积已达一千五百九十五万亩，抗旱抢种五百多万亩，进展较快的县市和许多先进的人民公社，早茬麦已播完，开始趁雨突击抢种晚茬。
    从8月下旬以来，山东大部地区先后发生秋旱，旱情比较严重的淄博、聊城、烟台、昌潍和济南等地区，秋播受到严重影响。中共山东省委向全党全民发出抗旱种麦的通知，号召各级党委进一步发动群众，克服困难，战胜秋旱，力争适时种足种好小麦。各地热烈响应党的号召，都纷纷调集了优势力量投入抗旱斗争。淄博聊城两个地区，组成百万抗旱大军，采用井、河、库、塘、坑五水归田和各种水利工具一齐上阵的方法突击抗旱抢种。寿张、无棣、高密、临清等县市和许多水源较为充足的人民公社，早茬麦已经播完，开始突击种晚茬。
    从25到26日，全省多数县市开始落雨，旱情有了缓和。但是今年秋收红薯多，秋种晚茬多，收和种挤在一起，农活繁重。在秋耕秋种中，各级机关、学校、部队大部分停工、停课、停操，全力以赴，参加秋种。省、地、县三级领导机关，在9月上旬以前，已经抽调八万名干部放到基层。各工厂、企业、交通运输部门也都抽调劳力、车、马参加秋种。
    对秋种任务重、困难较大的县
  （市）、社、队，大都在劳力、畜力、机械、工具等方面进行支援和大协作。聊城地区从县到公社共组织九千八百多名干部深入重点帮助抢耕抢种。临清市发动全市各工厂、机关、企业、学校，派出五千六百三十多名职工，带着大批机具车辆和农具，分别到七十一个种麦任务大的单位帮助秋种，三天浇地六千五百亩，耕翻地一千五百亩，播种二千一百七十亩。这个市的许多种棉的社、队和种粮多的社、队也都根据各自的特点，采取以工换工、定价付酬的方法，组织协作支援。
    本报讯　入秋以来，湖南省各地调集一百二十万精兵，向秋旱展开了激烈的斗争，确保秋粮丰收。据不完全统计：最近期间，受旱地区，经过千方百计，广辟水源，坚持抗旱，已使七分之一的受旱面积解除了干旱威胁。
    湖南秋旱的特点主要是插花局势。全省以常德、湘西土家族苗族自治州、湘潭、邵阳地区作物受旱面积较大。各地集中优势力量，大打抗旱歼灭战。滨湖沿江地区，一般水源不缺，大都采用车水灌田、拦河堵坝和机械灌田；距水源较远或塘干水尽的丘陵平原地区，大都采用开渠架枧引水、打井取水、车水灌田和担水淋禾。在干旱比较严重的益阳新桥河公社六万多亩一季晚稻和双季晚稻，有75％受旱，全社开动十四台抽水机，架起一千五百多张水车，人车机灌，日夜不停。同时挖井三千多口，挑水泼苗，使受旱晚稻全部得到灌溉。湘阴屈原农场一千多工人奋战三天，将汨罗江拦腰斩断，使江水驯服地流入拦河大坝，彻底解决了四千六百六十七亩晚稻和四千一百八十五亩旱土作物的水源问题，并且使全部灌溉自流化。
    为了使水库、塘、坝等充分发挥灌溉效益，各地都充分发挥了人民公社一大二公的威力，大兴协作之风，统一规划水源，尽量做到节约用水，滴水不丢。邵阳梽木山公社的如意等七个大队有余水，而高巩桥、白地等八个大队缺水，他们便按照“就近灌溉，合理用水”的原则，采取先远后近、先高后低、先急后缓、先活后死、以余补缺的办法，调整灌溉水系，解决了七千八百一十一亩稻田的灌溉问题，并且实现了自流灌溉。
    本报讯　山西省许多地区正在抗旱种麦。
    晋中地区今年小麦播种工作比以往任何一年开展的既快又好，从播种开始仅仅十天的时间，就下种一百三十六万余亩。就在这个紧要关头，全区的大部地区受到了严重的秋旱威胁。加之今年小麦回茬面积大（全区回茬面积占计划一半以上），而且和秋收挤在一起。因此，全区公社社员积极响应地委的号召，开展了一个声势浩大的抗旱种麦突击运动。投入抗旱种麦的人数已由三十二万人增加至四十四万余人，畜力由十万头增加到十二万五千余头，播种日进度由十万亩增加到十六万亩。
    晋东南区八十万亩正茬小麦已基本下种结束，在种回茬麦中碰到了干旱，如屯长县一般玉米地含水量在17％左右，谷子地含水量13％，菜地更少，含水量10％—11％。全区人民已紧急行动起来，千方百计大抓深耕、细耕、多耙、多耢，保墒下种，决心战胜旱魔，把回茬小麦种好。到9月16日统计，全区已下种小麦面积达九十九万多亩，其中下种回茬二十一点六万亩，占回茬小麦13.4％，而且下种的质量普遍良好。（附图片）
