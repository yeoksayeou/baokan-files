Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 15th - People from all walks of life in Oriente Province, Cuba, warmly support the Cuban Revolutionary Government's decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.

According to the "Sierra Maestra" newspaper, a rally was held in Santiago, the capital of Oriente Province, on the 14th to support Cuba's decision to establish diplomatic relations with China. The rally was organized by the Cuban "July 26th Movement" and the Chinese Overseas organization, the New Democratic League.

Leaders of the "July 26th Movement," the People's Socialist Party, the Rebel Army, peasant organizations, women's organizations, militias, the Rebel Youth Organization, and friends from all walks of life in Cuba attended the meeting. The atmosphere of the meeting was friendly, and everyone shouted "Long live Mao Zedong."

After the national anthems of Cuba and China were played, Arcelio Vildas, liaison officer of the "July 26th Movement" in Oriente Province, delivered the opening speech. He emphasized the importance of establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and condemned U.S. imperialism for supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan. He then announced that the Oriente Province Cuba-China Friendship Association would be formally established on October 1st, Chinese National Day, to celebrate the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Rita Diaz, representing the National Federation of Cuban Women, gave a report on her visit to the People's Republic of China. In her report, she enthusiastically praised the achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction. She concluded by saying, "We support the Chinese people's desire to continue the struggle against U.S. imperialism and for world peace."

Representatives of the New Democratic League and the Frank País Farmers' Association of Oriente Province also spoke at the meeting.

A leader of the Frank País Farmers' Association recently told the "Sierra Maestra" newspaper that the Frank País Farmers' Association supports the proposal to establish the Oriente Province Cuba-China Friendship Association. He said, "We are enthusiastic admirers of the Chinese people. We cannot forget the assistance provided to us by the 650 million Chinese people when U.S. imperialism was frantically attempting to undermine our revolution."

In a resolution recently adopted at a special meeting, the Federation of University Students of Oriente Province stated, "The Federation of University Students of Oriente Province strongly supports Cuba's establishment of relations with our brothers in People's China, because People's China is the faithful representative of the interests of the Chinese people and is the state that actually constitutes China." The resolution also expressed full support for the proposal to establish the Oriente Province Cuba-China Friendship Association, believing that this association is of particular importance to the connection and economic exchanges between the two peoples.
