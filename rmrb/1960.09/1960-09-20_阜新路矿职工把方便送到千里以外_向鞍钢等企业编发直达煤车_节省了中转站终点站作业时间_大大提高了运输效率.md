(Our newspaper, Shenyang, September 19th dispatch) The national model of railway-mining collaboration—the workers of the Fuxin Railway Department and the Fuxin Coal Mine, continuing to promote the spirit of communist cooperation, are compiling and dispatching a special direct coal train to key factories and mines such as Anshan Iron and Steel. To date, these direct coal trains have reached Anshan, Shenyang, Lushun-Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Jinxi, and other places, with a total of more than two hundred and fifty trains dispatched.

Now, a train after train full of coal is continuously departing from the Fuxin Coal Mine to Anshan Iron and Steel. They are loading the same variety of coal specifically supplied to Anshan Iron and Steel from the coal preparation plant of the Fuxin Coal Mine and transporting it directly to the front of the coal storage bin of the Anshan Iron and Steel gas generator station for unloading. The Shenyang Sujiatun transfer station and the Anshan Lingshan destination station, which the coal trains pass through, have saved time in disassembly and marshalling operations, reducing the total running time of coal trains from Fuxin to Anshan from 17 hours to 9 hours.

The Fuxin railway and mining workers also compile direct coal trains according to the arrival time of cargo ships at Qinhuangdao and Dalian ports, driving directly into the dock, so that the trains and ships are aligned, and the coal is directly unloaded from the train into the ship's hold without touching the ground. This not only shortens the dwell time of vehicles at Jinzhou, Shanhaiguan, Qinhuangdao, and other stations but also reduces a loading and unloading procedure, shortening the dwell time of cargo ships in the port.

The direct coal trains departing from the Fuxin Coal Mine have been praised by the workers of key factories and mines and along the transportation lines. They call this kind of direct coal train a "high-level dragon train" that delivers convenience to their doorstep.

This "high-level dragon train" is a new product of the Fuxin railway and mining workers' great collaboration based on the five transportation revolutions and "one-dragon" transportation. Although the "one-dragon" transportation method implemented in the past saved the disassembly and marshalling procedures at the transfer station and had great benefits for accelerating vehicle turnover, there were still shortcomings. For example, in the past, the coal transported from Fuxin to various users in Shenyang was still marshalled according to the old rules, regardless of the type of coal or which user it belonged to. When it arrived at Sujiatun Station in Shenyang, the entire coal train would be disrupted and disassembled, re-marshalled according to coal type and user, and then transferred to various enterprises separately. As a result, the dwell time of coal trains at Sujiatun Station was quite long. To shorten the dwell time of coal trains at brother stations and continue to improve transportation efficiency, Fuxin railway and mining workers studied further developing the "one-dragon" transportation experience, compiling and dispatching this "three-same" direct coal train of the same coal type, the same user, and the same arrival station, which can reduce the dwell time at transfer stations and destination stations.

In the process of organizing this direct coal train, Fuxin railway and mining workers promoted the noble communist style. At the beginning, they specifically sent people to Shenyang, Anshan, Qinhuangdao, Dalian, and other places to investigate the specific conditions of the distribution of special lines and unloading capacity of the destination stations and users. They also brought back a Shenyang train allocation route map from Shenyang Station, based on which they allocated vehicles and compiled direct coal trains.

The Fuxin Station's compilation and dispatch of direct coal trains added a series of troubles such as coupling, freight allocation, and waiting for trains, which extended the station's operating dwell time. However, the workers, according to the spirit of the instructions of the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, believed that: "We should not only calculate small accounts but also calculate big accounts. If our Fuxin Station spends a little more trouble, the arrival station will have great convenience; if our station extends the operating time by tens of minutes, the arrival station can shorten it by more than ten hours." It was under the guidance of this thinking of delivering convenience to thousands of miles away and leaving difficulties to ourselves that this "high-level dragon train" was born.

After Fuxin started dispatching direct coal trains, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Coal Industry all attached great importance to this experience and have requested that it be widely promoted throughout the country. Practice has proved that compiling and dispatching direct coal trains is a good way to improve transportation quality. It connects production, supply, transportation, and sales into a single line, tightly linked, which can greatly shorten the dwell time of coal trains at railway transfer stations and destination stations. Because the volume of coal transportation accounts for the largest proportion of national railway transportation, this has a considerable effect on improving the overall railway transportation volume. This direct coal train expands the collaboration between coal mines and local railway departments to the collaboration between the two and other railway bureaus and ports, which is a new development in the "one-dragon" transportation large-scale collaboration. Direct coal trains run on a fixed schedule and route, operate quickly, and return empty cars in a timely manner, which can not only ensure the coal needs of key enterprises but also promote the sustained leap forward in coal production and transportation work.

### 阜新路矿职工把方便送到千里以外  向鞍钢等企业编发直达煤车  节省了中转站终点站作业时间　大大提高了运输效率

    阜新路矿职工把方便送到千里以外
    向鞍钢等企业编发直达煤车
    节省了中转站终点站作业时间　大大提高了运输效率
    本报沈阳19日电　全国路矿协作的红旗——阜新铁路部门和阜新煤矿的职工，继续发扬共产主义协作精神，编发一种专门直达鞍钢等重点厂矿的直达煤车。到目前止，这种直达煤车已到达过鞍山、沈阳、旅大、秦皇岛、锦西等地，共开出二百五十多列。
    现在，一列列满载煤炭的直达列车正从阜新煤矿不断开往鞍钢。他们把专门供应鞍钢的同一品种的煤炭，从阜新煤矿的选煤厂装车开出，直接运到鞍钢煤气发生站的煤仓前面卸车。煤车中途经过的沈阳苏家屯中转站和鞍山的灵山终点站，都节省了解体、编组等作业时间，使煤车从阜新到鞍钢的整个运行时间，由过去的十七小时缩短到九小时。
    阜新路矿职工还根据秦皇岛、大连港的货船到港时间，编发直达煤车，一直开进码头，使车船对口，煤不落地，直接从车上卸进船舱。这样既缩短了车辆在锦州、山海关、秦皇岛等站的停留时间，又减少了一道装卸手续，压缩了货船在港口的停留时间。
    从阜新煤矿开出的直达煤车，受到重点厂矿和沿途运输部门职工的赞扬。他们称这种直达煤车是把方便送上门的“高级龙车”。
    这种“高级龙车”，是阜新路矿职工在五次运输革命和“一条龙”运输的基础上大搞协作的新产物。过去实行的“一条龙”运输的办法，虽然节省了中转站解体、编组的手续，对加速车辆周转等有很大好处，但还有美中不足之处。例如，过去阜新运给沈阳各用户的煤炭，编组时仍按照老规矩，不分煤的品种，不分属于哪个用户，开到沈阳苏家屯车站，再把整列煤车打乱解体，重新按煤种、按用户编组，然后分别转运到各企业。这样，煤车在苏家屯站的停留时间就相当长。为了缩短煤车在兄弟车站的停留时间，继续提高运输效率，阜新路矿职工便研究进一步发展“一条龙”运输经验，编发了这种可以减少中转站和终点站停留时间的同一煤种、同一用户和同一到达站的“三同”直达煤车。
    在组织这种直达煤车的过程中，阜新路矿职工发扬了崇高的共产主义风格。开始时，他们曾专门派人分别到沈阳、鞍山、秦皇岛、大连等地，调查了终点站和用户的专用线分布和卸车能力等具体情况，并从沈阳车站带回一张沈阳配车线路图，据以调配车辆，编发直达煤车。
    阜新车站编发直达煤车，给自己增添了挂钩、配货、等车等一连串麻烦，延长了本站作业停留时间。但是，职工们根据中共阜新市委指示的精神，认为：“应该不光算小账，还要算大账。我们阜新站多费一分麻烦，到达站就有十分方便；我们站延长几十分钟作业时间，到达站就能缩短十几小时。”就在这种把方便送到千里外、把困难留给自己的思想指导下，这种“高级龙车”便诞生了。
    阜新开出直达煤车以后，铁道部、冶金工业部、交通部、煤炭工业部对这一经验都很重视，已经要求全国各地普遍推行。实践证明，编发直达煤车是一个提高运输质量的好方法。它把产、供、运、销连成一线，环环紧扣，能大大缩短铁路中转站和终点站的煤车停留时间；由于煤炭运输量占全国铁路运输量的比重最大，这就对提高整个铁路运输量有相当大的作用。这种直达煤车把煤矿和当地铁路部门之间的协作，扩展到二者同其他铁路局和港口的协作，是“一条龙”运输大协作的新发展。直达煤车定时定线，运行很快，空车返回也及时，既能保证重点企业的煤炭需要，也能促进煤炭生产和运输工作的持续跃进。
