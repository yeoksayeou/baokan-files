    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 14th. The Luyi Iron Mine in Yiyuan County, Shandong Province, is vigorously strengthening internal mine transportation to promote ore production. The Luyishan mining area of this mine has built seven aerial ropeways, 1,200 meters of track (including 470 meters of inclined track), established two fixed freight yards, built four automobile loading slides, seven ore car loading funnels, and fifteen earth slides. It is also constructing a four-kilometer-long mine road. Transportation and loading equipment have been fully integrated, realizing continuous operation of transportation inside and outside the mine, achieving ropeway and track transportation, fixed freight yards, and funnelized loading. All transportation and loading facilities fully utilize gravity to slide from high to low positions.
    Due to the adoption of these measures in the Luyishan mining area, physical labor has been greatly reduced, transportation and loading efficiency has been improved, personnel have been saved, and production has been promoted. After the inclined track was built, sixteen people replaced the previous eighty. After the automobile loading slide was built, loading personnel were reduced from twenty-eight to fourteen, and loading time was reduced from twenty minutes to four minutes. Comparing the period before August 1959 with the present, the total number of people in this mining area has been reduced by half, and transportation personnel have been reduced from 800 to 170; while the daily ore output has increased from 280 tons to 500 tons. Due to the repeated increase in labor productivity, 175 people have been transferred to support agricultural production.
    In the process of improving mine transportation conditions, the mine's Party committee relied on the masses and resolutely implemented indigenous methods. Without machines or power, they utilized the steep terrain conditions, transforming disadvantages into advantages, and vigorously developed gravity-powered transportation. Most of the materials were also solved by their own efforts. The mine's inclined track was laid with earthen rails, and most of the automobile loading slopes were built with stones.
    The mine also paid attention to strengthening the collaboration between the mine and the transportation department, regarding transportation as an important task of the mine itself. The construction and maintenance of mine roads, loading equipment, and freight yards are all contracted by the mine itself, and there are often fifteen people responsible for maintaining mine roads. The transportation department also promptly transports equipment, explosives, and grain to the mine, achieving close integration of production and transportation, and mutual support.

### 变地势陡峻的不利条件为有利因素  芦芽铁矿大搞滑溜运输

    变地势陡峻的不利条件为有利因素
    芦芽铁矿大搞滑溜运输
    新华社济南14日电　山东沂源县芦芽铁矿大力加强矿内运输，促进矿石生产。这个矿的芦芽山采区已经修建空中索道七条，轨道一千二百米（内斜坡轨道四百七十米），建立固定货场两个，修建汽车装车滑板四个，矿车装车漏斗七个和土溜子十五个，并正修建四公里长的矿区道路。运输装卸设备都已经配套成龙，实现了矿内外运输流水作业，做到运输索道化、轨道化，货场固定化，装车漏斗化。所有运输装卸设施，完全利用地心引力自高处往低处滑行。
    芦芽山采区由于采取这些措施，大大减轻了体力劳动，提高运输装卸效率，节约了人员，促进了生产。斜坡轨道修建以后，十六人代替了过去的八十人。修建汽车装车滑板以后，装车人员由二十八人减到十四人，装车时间由二十分钟减到四分钟。以1959年8月份以前同现在比较，这个采区的总人数减少了一半，运输人员由八百人减到一百七十人；而矿石日产量却由二百八十吨增到五百吨。由于劳动生产率一再提高，先后已抽出一百七十五人去支援农业生产。
    在改进矿内运输条件过程中，这个矿的党委依靠群众，坚决实行土法上马，没有机器和动力，就利用地势陡峻的条件，变不利为有利，大搞滑溜化，材料也大部分依靠自己动手解决。这个矿的斜坡轨道就是用土铁轨铺设的，汽车装车滑坡大部分用石头砌成。
    这个矿还注意加强矿山同运输部门协作，把运输当作矿山本身的重要任务。矿区道路、装车设备、货场的修建养护，全部由自己包下来，并经常有十五人负责保养矿区道路。运输部门也及时为矿山运送设备、炸药和粮食，做到生产和运输紧密结合，互相支援。
