In the Competition Upsurge
 　 Production Records Are Constantly Being Broken
    In the new high tide of competition in the wire rod workshop of the Dongfeng Steel Plant in Changsha City, Hunan Province, the Red Flag production team – Team B – took the lead, and output continued to rise. The workers of Team A immediately went to Team B to learn from their experience, led by Jin Yuhua, the deputy secretary of the workshop's Party branch. After repeated discussions, they formulated measures to strengthen the technical force in weak areas and adjusted the machinery and equipment in a timely manner. The next day, they produced more than 22 tons of 12cm round steel in eight hours, setting a new record. By the third day, they had created an even higher record of more than 34 tons per shift. Since then, the output of Team A has leapt to an advanced level.
    After Team A broke the record twice, the workers of Teams B and C were both happy and anxious. Team B immediately convened a meeting of all workers that day to discuss the situation, and everyone unanimously proposed, "We must catch up!" At the same time, they sent people to Team A to learn from their experience. On August 19, Team A created a new record of 15.57 tons of 9cm wire rod per shift. Then, on the 21st, Team B closely followed and created a new record of 18.35 tons of 9cm wire rod per shift, winning the Red Flag for high output.

 　 高产纪录不断刷新
    在湖南长沙市东风钢厂线材车间的竞赛新高潮中，红旗生产班——乙班一马当先，产量不断上升。甲班的工人立即在车间党支部副书记金毓华的率领下，到乙班去取经。他们经过反复讨论，订出措施，加强了薄弱环节的技术力量，及时调整了机械设备。第二天，他们在八小时内生产出十二厘米圆钢二十二吨多，创造了新纪录。到第三天，又创造了班产三十四吨多的更高纪录。从此，甲班的产量跃到了先进水平。
    甲班两次创纪录以后，乙、丙两班的工人既高兴又着急。乙班在当天就召集全班工人开会讨论，大家一致提出“一定要赶上去！”同时派人到甲班去学习经验。八月十九日，甲班创造了班产九厘米线材十五点五七吨的新纪录。接着，在二十一日，乙班就紧紧赶上，创造了班产九厘米线材十八点三五吨的更新纪录，夺得了高产红旗。
