    Select Good Seeds During Autumn Harvest, Use Good Seeds for Autumn Planting
    To prepare for next year's spring sowing, sufficient high-quality seeds must be selected and retained during this year's autumn harvest. To ensure successful autumn planting this year, sufficient high-quality seeds must also be prepared immediately. Resolving the seed issue effectively is a major undertaking in striving for bumper harvests in both the summer and autumn seasons of next year.
    Selecting and using superior varieties is the most labor-saving, fastest-acting, and lowest-cost measure for increasing production. Since liberation, thanks to the efforts of the people across the country, major crops such as rice, wheat, cotton, corn, potatoes, and soybeans have basically achieved the use of improved varieties. This has played a significant role in promoting the continuous development of agricultural production in our country. The guiding principle for solving the seed problem in a faster, better, and more economical way is self-selection, self-propagation, self-retention, and self-use. Seeds have strict adaptability and limitations. To improve local crop varieties, it is necessary to introduce improved varieties from other regions in a planned way, but they must be tested and acclimatized before being widely promoted. The supply of seeds in large quantities and on a regular basis should rely on the communes and production teams to do it themselves, selecting and retaining seeds themselves, and also doing a good job in seed storage. This will not only ensure that there are enough seeds for sowing but also develop superior varieties suitable for local conditions, improve seed quality, and promote increased production of grain and other crops.
    Now, late rice, cotton, corn, potatoes, and other autumn-harvested crops have gradually matured. Communes in various regions should arrange for seed selection and retention work as soon as possible, organize the necessary labor force, and adopt methods such as block selection, ear selection, field selection, screening, and grain selection to select and retain seeds of autumn grain, cotton, and oil crops. According to the area and sowing amount of spring and summer crops next year, ensure that enough seeds are retained, with a slight surplus, in case of replanting and seedling replenishment. Seeds must be properly stored, collected in special warehouses by communes and production teams, frequently turned and dried, so that the seeds are not lost or mildewed, ensuring purity and germination rate.
    During the autumn harvest, special attention should be paid to selecting and retaining cotton and peanut seeds. This year, cotton will be harvested, processed, and sold centrally, which is a very good management method and must be resolutely implemented. However, the new method brings new problems, that is, under the condition of centralized processing, we must strictly prevent the mixing of cotton seeds. Since liberation, we have spent ten years to basically popularize improved cotton varieties. During centralized processing and sales, we must pay close attention to prevent the mixing of cotton seeds. Otherwise, years of effort will be ruined, causing irreparable losses. As long as everyone pays attention to this issue and relies on the strength of the communes and the cooperation of the commercial departments, this matter is not difficult to handle. When arranging cotton harvesting and processing this year, all regions must simultaneously arrange seed selection and retention work. Production teams and production squads must carefully select seeds, preferably by plot selection, plant selection, and boll selection, to maintain the purity of cotton seeds. Purchasing stations and ginneries of commercial departments should be responsible for purchasing, storing, and ginning the seed cotton of communes and production teams separately, preferably designating special improved variety ginneries to be responsible for this work. More attention should be paid to the problem of peanut seed retention. The amount of peanut seeds retained is much larger than that of other crops. In order to ensure increased peanut production next year, seed retention should be the primary task during peanut harvesting and purchasing this year. All communes and production teams with peanut planting plans must retain enough seeds according to the peanut planting area and the sowing amount per mu next year, and take good care of them to ensure the highest germination rate.
    Agricultural production is often affected by complex natural conditions. Therefore, when selecting and retaining seeds, not only should a large number of early-maturing and medium-maturing high-yield varieties be selected and retained, but also some late-maturing high-yield varieties should be selected and retained; not only should a large number of drought-resistant and high-yield varieties be selected and retained, but also flood-resistant and high-yield varieties should be selected and retained. Only when all varieties are complete can they adapt to various natural conditions, be prepared for any situation, and have nothing to fear in any case. This year, the disaster situation in some areas is relatively serious. All regions must also reserve a certain amount of disaster relief and famine preparedness seeds and vegetable seeds for use in the spring of next year.
    Seeds for autumn sowing this year should be prepared immediately. All regions generally paid attention to mass seed selection and retention during the summer harvest this year, and most regions have enough autumn sowing seeds. However, due to the unprecedented expansion of the autumn sowing area in various regions this year, and some regions have suffered serious natural disasters, seed preparation may be insufficient. All communes should immediately organize forces to conduct a universal inspection of seeds for autumn crops, striving to implement them mu by mu. General areas should implement the principle of self-reliance and solve the seed problem as much as possible; when necessary, they can organize support and adjustment between communes and teams based on the principle of equal value exchange. For a small number of disaster areas with real difficulties, the grain department should allocate and supply improved varieties as early as possible. As long as everyone regards this matter as a prerequisite for autumn sowing work, grasps it tightly and firmly, and treats it seriously, the seed problem can definitely be solved well.

### 秋收选良种　秋种用良种

    秋收选良种　秋种用良种
    为了准备明年的春播，必须在今年秋收中选留足够的优良种子。为了作好今年的秋种，也必须立即备妥足够的优良种子。很好地解决种子问题，是争取明年夏、秋两季丰收的一件大事。
    选用优良品种，是一项费工最少、见效最快、成本最低的增产措施。解放以来，由于全国人民的努力，水稻、小麦、棉花、玉米、薯类、大豆等主要作物，基本上实现了良种化，在促进我国农业生产连年发展方面起了极大的作用。多快好省地解决种子问题的方针，是自选、自繁、自留、自用。种子有严格的适应性和限制性。为了改良当地的作物品种，有计划地从外地引进良种，是必要的，但要经过试验、驯化，而不能立即大量推广。大量的、经常的种子供应，要依靠各地公社和生产队自己动手，自己选种、留种，同时做好种子保管工作。这样既能保证有足够的种子用以播种，又能发展适合当地条件的优良品种，提高种子的质量，促进粮食和别的作物的增产。
    现在，晚稻、棉花、玉米、薯类等秋收作物已陆续成熟，各地公社要及早安排选种、留种工作，组织必要的劳力，采取块选、穗选、场选、筛选、粒选等办法，选留秋粮、棉花、油料作物的种子。要根据明年春播、夏播作物的面积和播种量，保证留足种子，并且略有富余，以备改种和补苗之用。种子必须保管好，由公社和生产队专仓收藏，勤翻、勤晒，使种子不损失、不霉烂，保证纯度和发芽率。
    在秋收中，要特别注意选留棉花和花生种子。今年棉花要实行集中采摘、集中加工和集中交售，这是一种很好的经营方法，必须坚决实行。但是，新方法带来了新问题，即在集中加工的情况下，要严格防止棉种混杂。解放以来，我们费了十年的工夫，基本上普及了棉花良种。在集中加工、交售的时候，必须严加注意，防止棉种混杂。否则将使多年之功毁于一旦，造成难以弥补的损失。只要大家都注意这个问题，依靠公社的力量和商业部门的协作，这件事情是不难办好的。各地在安排今年棉花收摘、加工的时候，一定要同时安排选种、留种工作。生产队和生产小队要认真选种，最好实行片选、株选和铃选，以保持棉种的纯度。商业部门的收购站和轧花厂要负责分购、分存、分轧公社和生产队的留种棉，最好指定专门的良种轧花厂负责这项工作。花生的留种问题更要注意。花生留种量远比别种作物多。为了确保明年花生增产，今年收获和收购花生的时候，要将留种列为首要任务。凡是有花生种植计划的公社和生产队，都要按照明年花生播种面积和每亩播种量留足种子，并且精心保管，保证最高的发芽率。
    农业生产经常受复杂的自然条件的影响。因此，在选种、留种的时候，不仅要选留大量早熟、中熟的高产品种，也要选留一些晚熟的高产品种；既要选留大量抗旱高产的品种，也要选留耐涝高产的品种。只有各种品种搭配齐全，才能适应各种自然条件，在各种情况下都有备无患，有恃无恐。今年部分地区灾情比较严重，各地还须储备一定数量的救灾备荒种子和蔬菜种子，供明年春季使用。
    今年秋季播种用的种子要立即准备停当。各地在今年夏收中普遍注意了群众性的选种、留种，大部分地区的秋播种子是够用的。但是，由于各地今年秋播面积空前扩大，有些地区遭受了严重的自然灾害，种子准备就有可能不够了。各个公社要立即组织力量，对秋播作物的种子进行一次普遍检查，务求亩亩落实。一般地区要贯彻自力更生的方针，尽可能自行解决种子问题；必要时可以根据等价交换的原则，组织社与社、队与队之间的支援和调剂。对一小部分确有困难的灾区，粮食部门要及早调拨和供应良种。只要大家把这件事情作为秋播工作的先决条件，抓紧抓狠，严肃对待，种子问题一定可以很好地解决。
