Xinhua News Agency, Changchun Electric Report: Workers of the Tonghua Mining Bureau in Jilin Province, focusing on increasing the production of coking coal, refined coal, and improving transportation efficiency, launched a production increase and economy campaign. Since September, the output has risen rapidly. From the 1st to the 5th, the average daily output of coking coal increased by 19.41% compared with the previous five days, the average daily output of refined coal increased by 20%, and transportation efficiency increased by 11.3%.

After formulating a production increase and economy plan, forty advanced producers, including Bai Changfu, jointly issued a competition initiative to all employees. The workers responded enthusiastically and then launched head-to-head and counterpart competitions between shifts, groups, wells (workshops), and mines in the three aspects of mining, coal washing, and transportation. In the competition, seventeen pairs of small, locally-produced mines carried out large-scale technical transformations, resulting in a rapid increase in output. The Badoujiang Iron and Steel Plant and the Wangou three large coal washing plants also reformed their refinement equipment, increasing the amount of coal washing; At the same time, simple coal washing troughs were built to select refined coal from coal slime, increasing the daily production of refined coal by more than 400 tons. Transportation workers adopted a combination of coal storage warehouses, loading warehouses, high platforms, and manual loading of trains to ensure that coking coal was transported out in a timely manner.

In the production increase and economy campaign, the mining bureau transferred 690 cadres to the groups to eat, live, work, and discuss with the workers to improve group work and promote the balanced development of production in each shift. In order to strengthen the frontline of coking coal production, the mining bureau also transferred seven tunneling teams to support the three key coking coal mines of Sanchazi, Wangou, and Songshuzhen. In September, the number of coal mining and tunneling faces in each mine of the bureau increased compared with August. Some mines achieved "two tunneling teams to guarantee one coal mining team" and "one spare working face for three recovery working faces," which prepared the conditions for increasing production in September.

    改革精选设备扩大洗煤能力　抽调采掘力量支援重点矿井
    通化矿务局多产焦煤精煤
    新华社长春电　吉林省通化矿务局职工以增产焦煤、精煤、提高运输效率为中心，开展增产节约竞赛，9月份以来产量迅速上升，1到5日的焦煤平均日产量比前五天提高19.41％，精煤平均日产量提高20％，运输效率提高11.3％。
    这个矿务局在订出增产节约计划以后，先进生产者柏长富等四十人联合向全局职工发出了竞赛倡议，职工们热烈响应，随即在采掘、洗煤、运输三个方面开展了班与班、组与组、井与井（车间）、矿与矿之间的对手赛和对口赛。在竞赛中，十七对小型土法生产的矿井大搞技术改造，使产量迅速上升。八道江铁厂、湾沟三座大洗煤厂也改革了精选设备，增加了煤炭入洗量；同时建设简易洗煤槽，从煤泥中选精煤，每天多增产精煤四百多吨。运输职工采取储煤仓、装车仓、高站台与人力装火车相结合，保证了焦煤及时运出。
    在增产节约竞赛中，矿务局抽调了六百九十名干部到小组中去，和工人一起同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，抓好小组工作，促进各班生产平衡发展。为了充实焦煤生产第一线的力量，矿务局又抽调了七个掘进队支援三岔子、湾沟、松树镇等三个重点焦煤矿井。全局各矿的采煤、掘进工作面9月份都比8月份有了增加，有的矿井做到了“两个掘进组保一个采煤组”、“三个回采工作面有一个备用工作面”，为9月份增产准备了条件。
