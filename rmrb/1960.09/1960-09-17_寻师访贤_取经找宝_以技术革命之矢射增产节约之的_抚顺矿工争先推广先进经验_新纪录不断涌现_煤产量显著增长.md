Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 16th - Fushun Coal Mine employees are learning from experience and finding treasures everywhere in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, forming a new atmosphere of consciously learning advanced experiences, pushing the coal production competition to a new climax. The slogan of the entire mine's workers' competition is: learn from advanced experience regardless of size, promote advanced experience steadily, and apply advanced experience persistently. This has allowed many new and old experiences to shine brightly. In August, after winning the fight against the flood, coal production in various coal mines continued to increase; in early September, raw coal production increased by 21.3% compared with late August, refined coal increased by 8.2%, tunneling increased by 35.7%, and stripping increased by 26.3%.

	Comparing Promotion Speed, Matching into Complete Sets, Comparing Persistence in Application

Fushun Coal Mine employees, after overcoming the threat of the extraordinary flood in August, are in high spirits and full of energy. After summarizing the experience of the first half of this year, they quickly formulated a production increase plan for the next four months, and broke down the state plan into smaller parts, reaching down to the grassroots level, so that everyone knows the daily production tasks for each process, each type of work, each shift, each electric shovel, and each locomotive. Many groups of workers, on the basis of the original "multi-treasure combination," regarded learning and applying advanced experiences as the main measures to ensure the completion of the state plan. Therefore, a competition upsurge centered on learning advanced experience and applying advanced experience quickly swept the entire mine. Groups and workers launched a "three comparisons" competition: "Comparing who learns more advanced experiences, comparing who promotes advanced experiences faster, and comparing who applies advanced experiences more persistently." Workers in coal mines such as Laohutai, Longfeng, Shengli, and Xilutian used methods such as "searching high and low" and "seeking teachers and visiting sages" to collect various experiences, large and small, inside and outside the mine, and match them into complete sets. Under the leadership of the mine's Party committee, workers in each process and each type of work in the Laohutai Mine found methods for each other, picked experiences, and interviewed skilled workers; currently, more than 1,000 "skilled craftsmen" with unique skills have been recommended. Among them are Shang Wu and Jiao Xi, who can drill two-meter deep holes, Peng Fuheng, a fast prop installer, and Wang Hongyi, a safe and trouble-free filling worker.

The movement of employees and the masses consciously learning from experience and finding treasures has made advanced experiences more and more abundant, more and more complete, workers' confidence in production has become stronger and stronger, and their enthusiasm has become higher and higher. Now, many experiences have been matched into sets. Countless "multi-treasure combination" coal mining teams, "multi-treasure combination" tunneling teams, "multi-treasure combination" electric furnaces, and "multi-treasure combination" electric locomotives have emerged, effectively promoting coal production increase. After applying the deep hole drilling experience, the workers of the Five Three Two Team of the Fifth District of the Longfeng Mine increased the depth of the coal holes from 1.3 meters to 2 meters, and the progress of two rounds of blasting per day increased from 2.4 meters to 3.2 meters, and the daily output jumped from 566 tons in the past to more than 1,000 tons. Some time ago, Li Deqing, a prop installer at the Longfeng Mine, created a record of installing sixteen sets of supports in six hours, increasing work efficiency three times compared to the past; after many prop installers went to learn from advanced experience, they also increased their work efficiency by more than double in a short period of time.

	Combining Seeking Truth from Facts with Bold Initiative

"Learning lies in application." Workers, based on the characteristics of coal mine production being underground operations with ever-changing natural conditions, actively created conditions and insisted on applying advanced experiences at all times and in all places, achieving both seeking truth from facts and bold initiative in applying advanced experiences. The workers of the Three One Three Youth Tunneling Team of the Longfeng Mine combined and promoted the advanced experiences of this mine and other mines, greatly accelerating the tunneling progress and completing the entire year's tunneling task four months ahead of schedule. Entering September, the geological conditions of the tunneling face of this tunneling team deteriorated, and in order to insist on promoting the advanced experience of "deep hole blasting, speeding up progress," the workers tried every means to ensure that not a single piece of advanced experience was lost. On the coal seam roof that was prone to caving, the workers pre-set steel rail supports to protect it, so that the experience of "deep hole blasting, speeding up progress" could continue to play a role under the variable geological conditions. At the same time, in response to the situation that the operating conditions were not good and the loading machine could not be used, they adopted the method of cross-operation of digging workers and blasting workers, cross-operation of pushing coal workers and loading workers, and cross-operation of pushing cart workers and transporting material workers, so that there was no idle work and work hours were fully utilized. Therefore, the tunneling efficiency of the whole team in early September increased by one and a half times compared with late August.

Due to humble learning and diligent persistence in application, many new and old advanced experiences have been continuously improved and further developed. Wang Chaojie, the head driver of the electric shovel in the Fifth Coal Mining Area of ​​the Xilutian Coal Mine, made full preparations while waiting for the truck, shortening the average loading time per truck by two minutes, creating a record of an average of seven minutes and twenty seconds to load a truck in a small shift. Yan Fuyin, the driver of the second shift, learned Wang Chaojie's skills, accelerated the three actions of digging coal, turning the shovel, and releasing goods in the operation, shortening the average loading time per truck by another twenty seconds, creating a new record of an average of seven minutes to load a truck in a small shift. Pan Wenzi, the driver of the third shift, absorbed the advantages of the first two shifts, seized the time to "prepare goods" while waiting for the truck, making the advanced experience of fast loading more perfect, and achieving high output in every shift.

    寻师访贤　取经找宝　以技术革命之矢射增产节约之的
    抚顺矿工争先推广先进经验
    新纪录不断涌现　煤产量显著增长
    据新华社抚顺16日电　抚顺煤矿职工在增产节约运动中人人取经找宝，到处寻师访贤，形成了自觉学习先进经验的新风气，把增产煤炭的竞赛推向一个新的高潮。全矿工人竞赛的口号是：学习先进经验不论大小，推广先进经验踏踏实实，应用先进经验坚持不懈。这样，就使许多新老经验大放异彩。8月份，各煤矿在取得了抗洪胜利之后，煤炭生产不断提高；9月上旬的原煤产量又比8月下旬提高21.3％，精煤提高8.2％，掘进提高35.7％，剥离提高26.3％。
      比推广快　比配套成龙　比运用持久
    抚顺煤矿职工在战胜了8月份特大洪水威胁以后，斗志昂扬，干劲十足。他们在总结了今年上半年经验的基础上，迅速订出了今后四个月的增产计划，并且把国家计划化整为零，一竿子插到底，使人人都知道每日、每道工序、每个工种、每个班组、每台电铲、每台机车的生产任务。许多小组的工人在原有“多宝合一”的基础上，把学习和应用先进经验作为保证完成国家计划的主要措施。因此，一个以学习先进经验、运用先进经验为中心的竞赛热潮，迅速席卷全矿。组与组、工人与工人展开了“三比”竞赛：“比谁学习先进经验多，比谁推广先进经验快，比谁运用先进经验持久”。老虎台、龙凤、胜利、西露天等煤矿的工人用“翻箱倒柜”、“寻师访贤”的办法，把矿内外各种大小经验汇集起来，配套成龙。老虎台矿各工序各工种的工人在矿党委领导下，互相找办法、拣经验、采访能手；目前已经推荐出各有一技之长的“能工巧匠”一千多名。其中，有打眼两米深的打眼能手尚武和焦喜，有支柱快手彭福恒，有安全无故障的充填工王洪义。
    职工群众自觉取经找宝，自觉学习先进经验的运动，使先进经验越找越多，越配越全，工人的生产信心越来越足，干劲越鼓越高。现在，许多经验已经配成了套。出现了无数“多宝合一”采煤班，“多宝合一”掘进队，“多宝合一”电炉和“多宝合一”电机车，有力地促进了煤炭增产。龙凤矿五区五三二班工人应用深打眼经验后，煤眼深度由一点三米提高到二米，两遍炮日进度由二点四米提高到三点二米，日产量由过去五百六十六吨一跃突破千吨。前些日子，龙凤矿支柱工人李德清创造了六小时支十六架棚子的最高纪录，工作效率比过去提高三倍；很多支柱工人前去学习了先进经验以后，在短期内也把工作效率提高了一倍以上。
          实事求是和大胆积极相结合
      “学在于用”。工人们根据煤矿生产是地下作业、自然条件变化万千的特点，积极创造条件，时时处处坚持应用先进经验，做到应用先进经验既实事求是又大胆积极。龙凤矿三一三青年掘进组工人把本矿和外矿的先进经验综合起来推广，大大加快掘进进度，提前四个月完成了今年全年的掘进任务。进入9月份，这个掘进组的掘进工作面地质条件变坏，工人们为了坚持推广“深孔爆破，加快进度”的先进经验，千方百计使先进经验一件不丢，一个不少。在容易冒落的煤层顶板上，工人们预先设置了起保护作用的钢轨支架，使“深孔爆破，加快进度”的经验，在多变的地质情况下照常发挥作用。同时，他们针对作业条件不好，不能使用装车机的情况，采用了扒眼工和放炮工交叉作业、推煤工和装车工交叉作业、推车工和运料工交叉作业的办法，做到了不窝工，充分利用工时，因而全组9月上旬比8月下旬掘进效率提高一倍半。
    由于虚心学习和认真坚持运用，使许多新老先进经验得到了不断提高和进一步发展。西露天煤矿采煤五处电铲头班司机王朝杰，在等车的时候就充分作好准备，使平均每排车的装车时间缩短两分钟，创造了小班平均七分二十秒钟装一排车的纪录。二班司机阎福印学习了王朝杰一技之长，操作中加快了挖煤、转铲、放货三个动作，使平均每排车的装车时间又缩短二十秒钟，创造了小班平均七分钟装一排车的更新纪录。三班司机潘文子吸收了前两个班的优点，在等车时间抓紧“备货”，使快速装车的先进经验愈加完善，做到班班高产。
