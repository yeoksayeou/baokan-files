Qinghai Prepares Early for Next Year's Production
    People's communes in Qinghai Province are making early preparations for next year's production by seizing every opportunity to accumulate fertilizer, reclaim wasteland, select seeds, and plow land, in conjunction with current agricultural activities.
    Summer and autumn are good seasons for Qinghai to accumulate and create fertilizer. Various regions are generally seizing the opportunity to accumulate fertilizer for next year's large-scale production. Many production teams in Huangyuan County, due to their early start, have closely integrated fertilizer accumulation with their central tasks.
    During the current wheat harvest, all regions are combining harvesting with selecting and reserving good seeds for next year. Communes and farms are all using high-yield plots as seed selection bases, conducting bulk selection, ear selection, and plant selection.
    Plowing this year also started earlier and is progressing faster than last year. In order to make full use of the land to increase grain production, regions with suitable conditions are immediately plowing and replanting after harvesting; regions unsuitable for replanting are also plowing early to preserve moisture, eliminate weeds, and enhance soil fertility.

Inner Mongolia Strengthens Autumn Field Management
    Various regions of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are making every effort to strengthen the late-stage management of autumn crops, striving to increase grain production this autumn.
    In the overproduction campaign, all regions have paid close attention to strengthening the management of third-class seedlings (weak or poorly developed seedlings). Shi Guanghua, First Secretary of the CPC Jirem League Committee, went deep into the Dongming People's Commune in Naiman Banner, and promptly summarized and promoted the experience of eliminating empty corn stalks, thereby greatly reducing the number of empty corn stalks in the entire commune. The vast number of young people in the Hulunbuir League organized professional teams to carry out shock elimination of third-class seedlings, increasing the number of first-class seedlings in the league's 1.37 million mu of youth high-yield fields to 80%.
    All regions have also done a timely job in preventing and controlling insect pests in autumn field management.

Gansu Launches Autumn Field Weeding Campaign
    The people of Gansu Province are actively responding to the Provincial Party Committee's call to seize the current opportune time for autumn field management, increase measures, and strive to obtain more harvests in autumn, launching a large-scale shock campaign for autumn field management.
    The shock campaign focuses on weeding. Due to the resolute measures taken by various regions to focus on labor allocation and utilization, the number of people participating in the shock weeding campaign across the province has reached more than 1.4 million. Leading cadres at all levels have also gone deep into the fields, weeding alongside the masses, and helping grassroots cadres solve specific problems, promoting the vigorous and solid development of the campaign.
    While focusing on weeding, all regions have also focused on topdressing, watering, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, and are striving to improve the level of autumn field management in every possible way.

Shandong Cotton-Producing Areas Strengthen Cotton Field Management
    Currently, cotton in Shandong is in the stage of setting autumn bolls and protecting the summer bolls. According to the growth law of cotton bolls, which states "half in summer, half in autumn," and the strong late-stage boll-setting characteristics and great yield-increasing potential of Daizi cotton, leading cadres at all levels have gone deep into the fields, mobilizing the masses to adopt measures such as topdressing, loosening soil, pruning, and preventing insect pests.
    Some time ago, due to continuous rainy weather in some areas of Shandong, some cotton fields were overgrown with weeds. Leaders at all levels in these areas quickly mobilized forces and took various measures to strengthen cotton field management based on soil conditions and the degree of weed overgrowth.

Tibetan Herdsmen Focus on Livestock Fall Fattening
    Currently, it is the season of lush grass and abundant water in the pastoral areas on the Tibetan Plateau. Herdsmen who have been emancipated in various regions are taking advantage of this great opportunity to focus on livestock fall fattening and actively prepare livestock for a good winter and spring.
    In order to focus on livestock fall fattening, many districts and townships in Heihe, Damxung, Mozhugongka, and Lhari counties have convened herdsmen meetings, summarized local original grazing experience, and promoted advanced grazing methods, generally implementing separate grazing for old, weak, male, and female livestock. After carrying out the campaign to focus on fall fattening, the herdsmen in the Qiudejiang District of Lhari County saw that more than 30,000 sheep, whose average weight was only about 35 jin (approximately 17.5 kg) in July, have now grown to more than 50 jin (approximately 25 kg).

    夏秋两季是青海积肥造肥的好季节。各地普遍抓紧时机为明年的大生产积造肥料。湟源县许多生产队由于动手早，把积肥同中心工作紧密结合起来。
    在当前的麦收中，各地都结合收割为明年选留良种。各公社、农场都以丰产方为选种基地，进行块选、穗选、株选。
    今年翻地也比去年动手早，进展快。为了充分利用土地增产粮食，有条件的地区在收割后都立即翻耕复种；不宜复种的地区也都及早翻地，以便保墒、灭草和增强地力。
    内蒙古加强秋田管理
    内蒙古自治区各地全力加强秋田作物的后期管理，力争今年秋季多增产一些粮食。
    各地在超产运动中，都很注意加强三类苗的管理。中共哲里木盟委员会第一书记石光华，深入奈曼旗东明人民公社，及时总结推广了消灭玉米空秆的经验，从而使全公社玉米空秆大大减少。呼伦贝尔盟广大青年组织专业队突击消灭三类苗，使全盟一百三十七万亩青年丰产田的一类苗骤增到80％。
    各地在秋田管理中防治虫害的工作也做得很及时。
    甘肃开展秋田锄草运动

    前些日子，山东部分地区因阴雨连绵，一部分棉田出现草荒，这些地区各级领导都迅速调集力量，根据土质条件和草荒不同程度，分别采取各种办法加强棉田管理。
    西藏牧民大抓牲畜秋膘
    目前正是西藏高原上牧区水草丰茂的季节，各地翻身牧民纷纷利用大好时机，大抓牲畜秋膘，为牲畜过好冬春积极作准备。
    为了抓好牲畜秋膘，黑河、当雄、墨竹工卡和拉加里等县的许多区、乡都召开了牧民会议，总结了当地原有的放牧经验，并推行了先进的放牧方法，普遍按牲畜的老、弱、公、母实行了分群放牧。拉加里县丘德江区的牧民在开展大抓秋膘活动以后，三万多只在7月份平均体重只有三十五斤左右的羊子，现在已长到五十多斤重了。
