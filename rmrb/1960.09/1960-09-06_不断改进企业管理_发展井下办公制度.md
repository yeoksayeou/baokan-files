Continuously Improve Enterprise Management and Develop Underground Office System
Xing Guangxin, Secretary of the CCP Chongqing Yutianpu Coal Mine Committee

Since May of this year, our coal mine has implemented an underground office system. In the process of implementing this system, we have continuously improved our enterprise management, promptly resolved various newly emerging problems, and continuously consolidated and improved this system. Currently, 80% of cadres from mine-level Party and mass organizations and departments in our coal mine regularly "settle down" in production teams to participate in and lead production. Over 90% of well-level Party, government, labor union, and Youth League cadres go down into the mine to work every day. Principal leading cadres such as the Party Secretary and Mine Manager, in addition to taking turns leading second-line work, spend an average of five days a week "squatting" and "rotating" to participate in underground office activities. Now, it has become common, regular, and institutionalized for cadres throughout the mine to go deep into the front lines of production, participate in and lead production, and eat, live, work, and consult with the masses. Systems such as cultivating "experimental plots" and working alongside laborers have also seen new developments. All tasks in the mine have achieved a new leap forward.

Implementing a complete team of political workers and management personnel going underground to work is a revolution in coal mine enterprise management. The implementation of this system has yielded good results. However, like other new things, the underground office system cannot be perfect at the beginning and needs to be continuously improved in practice to make it more complete.

In the early stages of implementing the underground office system, we encountered the following problems: After a large number of cadres went underground to work, how should the work of the second line keep up accordingly? How can frontline cadres regularly eat, live, work, and consult with workers? How can points and surfaces be better combined? And so on. Only by promptly solving these problems can we fully leverage the superiority of the underground office system and make it institutionalized and regular. In the process of implementing the underground office system, in addition to carrying out the struggle between old and new ideas, we also solved these specific problems one by one to make the system more consolidated and improved. Our specific approaches mainly include the following:

Reform departmental operations and reduce cumbersome departmental affairs. Ensure that cadres at all levels regularly go deep into the front lines of production. In this regard, we mainly delegate some planning, technical, personnel, and financial powers to the production teams, relying on workers to do a good job in management. Functional departments at the well and mine levels should strengthen leadership and comprehensive balance. We have established "nine major staff members" in each production team for planning, economic accounting, safety inspection, materials and tools management, labor wage attendance, labor protection and life, competition, publicity, and cultural and technical education, so that everyone has something to do and everything is managed. In this way, the daily affairs of the mine and wells are greatly reduced, allowing cadres at all levels to have more time to go deep into the front lines of production. For example, after the geological surveying department carried out business reforms, workers from the geological surveying teams of each well participated in the management of 80% of the department's daily business, such as setting lines, laying lines, mining area geology, hydrogeology, and engineering surveying. The daily business work within the department has been greatly reduced, and 70% to 80% of the cadres can regularly be rotated to "settle down" in the coal mining face to participate in production and lead production.

Cadres going deep into the front line implement the method of "letting go, contracting, and pushing production up within a time limit." Departments and offices, as units, separately "settle down" on a mining face, eat, live, work, and consult with workers. This allows cadres of each department to more planned and regularly carry out "four togethers" with workers and more effectively solve key production problems. Our specific method is: according to the principle of business counterpart, specialized use, implement department, office and production team hook-up, "fixed point settlement," by the cadres of each department or office separately contract a mining face or responsible for solving a key production problem. For example, the Youth League Committee contracts the youth mining face; the cadres of the general affairs section, focusing on developing non-staple food production and running the canteen well, participate in labor in the canteen and do a good job in the canteen. Leading cadres and various departments throughout the mine are fixedly linked to each well, plant, and team, implementing the method of "four packages" (package production, package ideology, package technical innovation, package safety), and pushing production up within a time limit to achieve sustained leap forward. We, based on the principle of both long-term adherence to the "four togethers" and not delaying second-line work, have reasonably adjusted and arranged cadre forces, regularly drawing 80% of the cadres deep into the front lines of production, leaving about 20% of the cadres to adhere to second-line work, combining the first and second lines, and implementing batch and regular rotation. The cadres of the Youth League Committee eat, live, work, and consult with workers on the ninth youth coal mining face of the third well. They found that some workers lacked confidence in achieving a larger increase in production, which affected the further improvement of production. They guided the team workers to carefully calculate the four accounts of the national plan, the power of new technologies, equipment potential, and advanced levels, and helped the workers to formulate a plan to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule. All the workers in the team were encouraged to work harder, and the daily output of raw coal quickly increased from about 500 tons to more than 800 tons.

Combine points and surfaces, with points leading the surfaces. After a large number of cadres go deep into the mining face to "squat," they can use the "stars all over the sky" points and richer typical experience to better promote the work of the surface. This requires further strengthening the work of exchanging experience. We use forms such as on-site meetings and telephone conferences to promptly and quickly spread the work experience of the points to the surface, so that flowers bloom in one place and bear fruit everywhere.

Implement the "two-five system" of leadership methods to comprehensively arrange work and study time. In order to ensure that cadres at all levels can regularly go underground to work, we have implemented the "two-five system" of leadership methods in the mine-level organs. The Party Secretary, Mine Manager, and middle-level and above leading cadres spend five days a week going deep into the front lines of production to "squat" and conduct round-trip inspections to understand the overall situation, and two days a week to return to the mine to hold meetings to summarize and deploy work, discuss mining deployment, and conduct theoretical studies. Usually, when special circumstances require meetings to be held, mine-level leading cadres hold telephone conferences or on-site meetings with the participation of each well at the wellhead where they are "squatting" to study and solve problems on the spot. After the implementation of the "two-five system" of leadership methods, not only is the time for work, study, and meetings comprehensively arranged, but also cadres at all levels are guaranteed more time to go down into the mine to direct production and study and handle major problems.

Carry out "five good" (good in putting politics in command, good in implementing the party's policies and policies, good in completing tasks in underground office, good in participating in production and leading production, good in consulting with workers, and good in learning) competitions among cadres. Summarize once a month, compare once a month, commend good people and good deeds, and exchange experience in first- and second-line work. This can set a clear banner and learning model for the majority of cadres and powerfully promote the consolidation and development of the underground office system.

Through the above series of work, the underground office system has exerted greater power. On the basis of the continued leap forward from January to July, the output of raw coal, coke, and the total footage of tunneling in August have increased significantly compared with July. In the future, we must continue to improve enterprise management and further consolidate and develop the underground office system in order to promote a greater increase in coal production and ensure the sustained leap forward in steel production and other areas.

    不断改进企业管理　发展井下办公制度
    中共重庆市鱼田堡煤矿委员会书记　邢广信
    今年5月份以来，我们煤矿推行了井下办公制度。在推行这一制度的过程中，我们不断改进企业管理工作，及时地解决了新出现的各种问题，使这一制度不断巩固和提高。目前，我们煤矿矿一级党群机关和科室等部门经常保持有80％的干部在生产小组“安家落户”，参加生产领导生产。井一级党、政、工、团干部，每天有90％以上的人下井办公。党委书记、矿长等主要领导干部，除了轮流领导第二线的工作以外，每周平均有五天时间“蹲点”、“转面”，参加井下办公活动。现在，全矿干部深入生产第一线，参加生产领导生产，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，已经普遍化、经常化、制度化；种“试验田”、跟班劳动等制度也有了新的发展；第一线、第二线的工作井然有序。全矿各项工作实现了新的跃进。
    实行政治工作人员和管理人员的一整套班子下井办公，是煤矿企业管理工作的一个革命。推行这个制度以后，收到了良好的效果。但是，井下办公制度也和其他新生事物一样，在开始时不可能尽善尽美，需要在实践中不断改进，使之更加完善。
    在推行井下办公制度初期，我们曾经遇到过这样一些问题：大批干部下井办公以后，第二线的工作如何相应地跟上？第一线干部如何经常作到与工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量？点和面如何更好地结合？等等。及时解决这些问题，才能充分发挥井下办公制度的优越性，使井下办公制度化、经常化。我们在推行井下办公制度过程中，除了开展新旧思想的斗争以外，还一个一个地解决这些具体问题，使这一制度更加巩固和提高。我们的具体作法主要有以下几点。
    改革科室业务，减少科室繁琐事务。保证各级干部经常深入生产第一线。在这方面，我们主要是将部分计划、技术、人事和财务权下放给生产小组，依靠工人搞好管理；井和矿一级职能部门则加强领导和综合平衡工作。在各生产小组建立了计划、经济核算、安全检查、材料工具管理、劳动工资考勤、劳动保护和生活、竞赛、宣传、文化技术教育等“九大员”，作到人人有事干，事事有人管。这样，矿、井的日常事务就大大减少，使各级干部能有更多的时间深入生产第一线。例如，地质测量科进行业务改革以后，全科定线、放线、采区地质、水文地质、工程测绘等80％的日常业务，都发动各井地质测量小组的工人参加管理。科内日常业务工作大大减少，能够经常轮流抽出70％到80％的干部到采煤掌子面“安家落户”，参加生产，领导生产。
    深入第一线的干部实行“放下去，包起来，把生产限期突上去”的办法，以部门和科室为单位，分别到一个掌子面去“安家落户”，与工人同吃，同住，同劳动，同商量。这样可以使各部门的干部能更有计划地经常地跟工人实行“四同”，更有效地解决生产关键问题。我们的具体办法是：按照业务对口、专长专用的原则，实行部门、科室同生产小组挂钩，“定点落户”，由各部门或科室的干部分别包一个掌子面或负责解决一个生产关键问题。例如，团委包青年掌子面；总务科的干部以发展副食品生产，办好食堂为中心，在食堂参加劳动，搞好食堂工作。全矿领导干部和各科室同各井、厂、组固定挂钩，实行“四包”（包生产、包思想、包技术革新、包安全）的办法，限期把生产突上去，实现持续跃进。我们本着既能长期坚持
  “四同”，又不耽误第二线工作的原则，合理调整和安排了干部力量，经常抽出80％的干部深入生产第一线，留20％左右的干部坚持第二线工作，一、二线结合，实行分批、定期轮换。团委干部在三井第九青年采煤掌子面跟工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，发现有部分工人对实现生产更大幅度的增长信心不足，影响生产更上一层楼。他们就引导小组工人大算国家计划、新技术的威力、设备潜力、先进水平等四笔账，帮助工人订出了提前完成今年计划的规划。全组工人都鼓足更大的干劲，原煤日产量很快由五百吨左右提高到八百吨以上。
    点面结合，以点带面。大批干部深入掌子面“蹲点”以后，便能以“满天星”的点、更加丰富的典型经验来更好地推动面的工作。这就需要进一步加强交流经验的工作。我们运用现场会、电话会等形式，及时迅速地把点的工作经验传播到面上去，作到了一处开花，遍地结果。
    推行“二五制”的领导方法，全面安排工作和学习时间。为了保证各级干部都能经常下井办公，我们在矿级机关推行了“二五制”的领导方法，党委书记、矿长和中层以上的主要领导干部，每周有五天时间深入生产第一线“蹲点”和巡回检查了解全面情况，每周有两天时间回矿开会总结、布置工作，讨论采掘部署，进行理论学习等。平时遇特殊情况需要召开会议时，矿级领导干部就在“蹲点”的井口召开各井参加的电话会或现场会，就地研究解决问题。实行“二五制”的领导方法以后，不仅全面地安排了工作、学习和开会的时间，而且保证了各级领导干部有更多的时间下井指挥生产，研究处理重大问题。
    在干部中开展“五好”（政治挂帅好、贯彻执行党的方针政策好，下井办公完成任务好，参加生产领导生产好，与工人同商量好，学习好）竞赛。一月一总结，一月一评比，表扬好人好事，交流一、二线工作经验。这样能给广大干部树立鲜明的旗帜和学习榜样，有力地推动了井下办公制度的巩固和发展。
    通过上述一系列工作，井下办公制度发挥出了更大的威力。全矿在1至7月份继续跃进的基础上，8月份的原煤、焦炭产量和掘进总进尺，都比7月份有不小的增长。今后，我们要继续改进企业管理工作，使井下办公制度进一步巩固和发展，以便促进煤炭生产更大幅度地增长，保证钢铁生产等持续跃进。
