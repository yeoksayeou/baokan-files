Xinhua News Agency, 12th: A grand rally of 100,000 people from all walks of life in the capital was held this afternoon to warmly welcome Sékou Touré, the national hero who led the Guinean people to achieve independence, and to express brotherly and lofty respect to the heroic Guinean people.

Mayor Peng Zhen and President Sékou Touré delivered passionate speeches at the mass rally, which resembled a sea of people. Mayor Peng Zhen emphasized in his speech: "The 650 million Chinese people have been, are, and will always be the most reliable friends of Guinea and all African people." President Sékou Touré firmly stated that the Guinean people will, together with the Chinese people, "more courageously and consciously engage in the struggle against imperialism."

The distinguished guests received the most sincere respect from the 100,000 audience members in Beijing, who paid tribute to the envoy of the Guinean people, who were holding high the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism, with stormy applause and enthusiastic cheers.

The welcoming rally was held at the huge Eastern Suburbs Workers' Stadium. The venue was filled with an atmosphere of joy and friendship. The national flags of the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Guinea were erected high above the rostrum, and colorful flags fluttered everywhere inside and outside the stadium. The oval-shaped surrounding stands were packed with people, and under the intense spotlights from all directions, the colorful autumn clothing adorned the venue in a dazzling array. On the walls around the venue, huge slogans caught people's eyes: "Welcome the respected President Sékou Touré and all distinguished Guinean guests!" "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Guinean people!" "Long live the victory of the African national independence movement!"

At 6 p.m., President Sékou Touré, accompanied by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, Mayor Peng Zhen, Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi and other leaders, ascended the rostrum. At this moment, the band played a welcoming tune, and 100,000 people stood up in unison, applauding thunderously. The huge light slogan "Salute the Heroic Guinean People," composed of countless lights, flashed brightly. Accompanying President Sékou Touré onto the rostrum were Diallo Saifoulaye, Speaker of the Guinean National Assembly, Louis Lansana Béavogui, Minister of National Economy, and Keita N'famara, Minister of Planning. A group of Young Pioneers presented flowers to President Sékou Touré and all the distinguished Guinean guests.

Also seated on the rostrum were Guo Moruo and Chen Shutong, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council, Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Liu Changsheng, President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, Ke Hua, our ambassador to Guinea, Wan Li, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, Liu Ren, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and responsible persons from various aspects of Beijing Municipality.

Foreign guests from various African countries and students studying in China were invited to attend today's rally.

The welcoming rally began with the band playing the national anthems of the Republic of Guinea and the People's Republic of China. Mayor Peng Zhen spoke at the rally, expressing the respect of the people of the capital and all the Chinese people to President Touré and all the distinguished Guinean guests. He said that the heroic struggle of President Touré and the Guinean people has inspired the liberation struggles of the oppressed nations of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and has inspired the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and its running dogs. The Chinese people express their heartfelt admiration and warm congratulations for the great achievements made by President Touré and the Guinean people in their struggle.

Mayor Peng Zhen said: The day when the African people will once again become the masters of the entire African continent is not far off. The Chinese people feel infinitely joyful and inspired by the victory of the great African people. The 650 million Chinese people express their heartfelt admiration and warm congratulations to all the fighting African brothers.

Mayor Peng Zhen pointed out that the old-brand colonialists who have long occupied Africa are attempting to maintain their colonial interests by changing their appearance. At the same time, the US imperialists are taking the opportunity to break into Africa, attempting to seize the position of the old-brand colonialists and replace them. They are attempting to impose new colonial shackles on the African people in the name of "economic assistance." Recently, the US imperialists' armed intervention in the Congo under the banner of the United Nations has most nakedly exposed that US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the African national independence movement. Imperialism is, after all, imperialism, just as a jackal is, after all, a jackal. The African people are increasingly and profoundly understanding from their own personal experience that in order to strive for and safeguard their national independence, they must wage a persistent struggle against imperialism, headed by the United States, and its running dogs.

Mayor Peng Zhen condemned the imperialists for slandering and vilifying the African people and for disseminating a large number of fallacies beautifying imperialism and colonialism.

He said that Africa's economic backwardness is entirely caused by the rule of colonialism and imperialism. The African people are brave, hardworking, and intelligent. The awakened African people are politically many times more civilized than the imperialists. It is precisely imperialism, headed by the United States, that is truly barbaric and backward. Once the African people break the shackles of colonialism and imperialism and become the true masters of their own countries, they will quickly demonstrate their outstanding ability to manage and build their own countries and quickly overcome their economic backwardness. The newly emerging Republic of Guinea is an example. The African people not only have the right but also the full ability to manage their own countries well. The sympathy and support of the people of the world are on the side of the African people who are fighting against imperialism and defending and striving for independence and freedom. We believe that as long as we persist in the struggle, the great African people will surely continue to advance from victory to victory.

Mayor Peng Zhen said that the people of China and Guinea have a deep brotherly affection. In the common cause of opposing imperialism, safeguarding national independence, and striving for world peace, the people of our two countries are closely related and support each other. The 650 million Chinese people have been, are, and will always be the most reliable friends of Guinea and all African people.

President Sékou Touré spoke amidst thunderous applause. He said that the current struggle of the people of all countries against imperialism gives greater value to the struggle of mankind for social, economic, and cultural welfare.

When speaking about the struggle of the people of all countries against imperialism, President Sékou Touré pointed out that this is a struggle between justice and injustice, between freedom and slavery, and between progress and reaction. He said that we can assert that no matter how long the mutual struggle lasts, only one side can win, and that is only the side of the people's power.

President Sékou Touré condemned the barbaric imperialism and colonialism for their enslavement, discrimination, and oppression of Africa. He said that the various activities of the imperialists and colonialists have harmed the dignity of the people of African countries and aroused the resistance of the people of African countries. The African revolution is fundamentally opposed to the maintenance of imperialism. He said that every progress Africa makes on the road to political, economic, social, and cultural liberation means the failure of imperialism.

He said that the more the people of African countries can increase understanding and the better the concerted action is organized, the more effective our common struggle will be, and the ideal that we all care about at all times: the ideal of ending imperialism, ending all kinds of colonialism, and ending feudalism will be realized more quickly.

President Touré said that in Africa, in Asia, in America, in Europe, in all human societies, the forces against imperialism are growing stronger; and as we successively gain liberation, as the strength of our struggle against imperialism becomes stronger and stronger, the number and power of those who insist on maintaining injustice in the world will be weakened day by day. We say that the road to victory is no longer long.

President Sékou Touré said that our friend, the mayor of Beijing, is very correct in comparing imperialism to a jackal. Indeed, if it wants to, the jackal can change its appearance, change its language, change its position, but its nature can never be changed, that is to say, it can never change its actions towards goats.

President Sékou Touré expressed his intention to bring the greetings, affection, and friendship of the Chinese people to the African people. He said that not only that, but we will also try our best to be with you and carry out the same struggle for the same cause.

The speeches of Mayor Peng Zhen and President Sékou Touré were received with extremely warm welcomes, constantly interrupted by storms of applause.

After the speeches, Mayor Peng Zhen, on behalf of the people of the capital, presented a flag and gifts to President Sékou Touré amidst joyful music and earth-shattering cheers. When President Sékou Touré took the brocade flag embroidered with "Salute to the Heroic Guinean People and Their Leader President Sékou Touré! Wishing the Friendship Between the Chinese and Guinean People Last Forever!" from Mayor Peng Zhen, he shook hands tightly with Mayor Peng Zhen.

The rally was announced to be over. When Chairman Liu Shaoqi and President Sékou Touré walked out of the venue, they repeatedly waved to the audience. At this time, people waved countless colorful flags and flowers, and the slogans "Long Live the Friendship Between the Chinese and Guinean People" rose and fell, resounding through the sky.

    首都十万人盛会热烈欢迎塞古·杜尔总统
    彭真市长说，六亿五千万中国人民过去、现在和将来都是几内亚和全体非洲人民最可靠的朋友
    杜尔总统表示，几内亚人民将和中国人民一起，愈来愈勇敢而自觉地进行反对帝国主义的斗争
    新华社12日讯　首都各界人民十万人今天下午举行盛大隆重的集会，热烈欢迎领导几内亚人民取得独立的民族英雄塞古·杜尔总统，向英雄的几内亚人民表示兄弟般的崇高的敬意。
    彭真市长和塞古·杜尔总统在一片人海般的群众大会上发表了充满热情的讲话。彭真市长在讲话中强调指出：“六亿五千万中国人民过去、现在和将来都是几内亚和全体非洲人民最可靠的朋友。”塞古·杜尔总统坚定地表示，几内亚人民将和中国人民一起，“愈来愈勇敢而自觉地进行反对帝国主义的斗争”。
    尊贵的客人在这里接受了北京十万听众最真挚的敬意，人们用暴风雨般的掌声和热烈的欢呼向高举反帝国主义、反殖民主义旗帜的几内亚人民的使者致敬。
    欢迎大会在巨大的东郊工人体育场举行。会场上充满了欢乐和友谊的气氛。会场主席台上面高竖中华人民共和国和几内亚共和国的国旗，体育场内外到处飘扬着彩旗，椭圆形的四周看台上，人们坐得人山人海，在四面八方的强烈的聚光灯下，晚秋的各色服装把场内点缀得五彩缤纷。在会场四周的墙壁上，巨大的标语映入人们的眼帘：“欢迎尊敬的塞古·杜尔总统和全体几内亚贵宾！”“中国和几内亚人民的友谊万岁！”“非洲民族独立运动胜利万岁！”
    下午六时，塞古·杜尔总统由刘少奇主席，董必武副主席，彭真市长，国务院副总理陈毅等领导人陪同，登上会场主席台，这时，乐队奏起欢迎乐曲，十万人一致起立，掌声雷动，会场上由无数灯光组成的“向英雄的几内亚人民致敬”的巨大灯光标语，闪闪发光。同塞古·杜尔总统一起进入主席台的，有几内亚国民议会议长迪阿洛·塞福拉耶，国民经济部长路易·兰萨纳·贝阿沃吉，计划部长凯塔·恩法马拉。一群少年先锋队员向塞古·杜尔总统和全体几内亚贵宾献了鲜花。
    在主席台上就座的，还有全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若、陈叔通，国防委员会副主席张治中，外交部副部长章汉夫，中国非洲人民友好协会会长刘长胜，中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志，我国驻几内亚大使柯华，北京市副市长万里，北京市政协委员会主席刘仁，以及北京市各方面的负责人。
    在北京的非洲各国外宾和各国留学生，应邀参加了今天的大会。
    欢迎大会在乐队奏几内亚共和国国歌和中华人民共和国国歌声中开始。彭真市长在大会上讲话，他表达了首都各界人民和全中国人民对杜尔总统和几内亚全体贵宾们的敬意。他说，杜尔总统和几内亚人民的英勇斗争鼓舞了非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲被压迫民族的解放斗争，鼓舞了全世界人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争。中国人民对杜尔总统和几内亚人民在斗争中取得的巨大成就，表示衷心的敬佩和热烈的祝贺。
    彭真市长说：非洲人民重新成为整个非洲大陆主人的日子已经不远了。中国人民对于伟大的非洲人民的胜利，感到无限的欢欣鼓舞。六亿五千万中国人民向斗争中的非洲全体弟兄们，表示衷心的敬佩和热烈的祝贺。
    彭真市长指出，长期霸占非洲的老牌殖民主义者正在企图用改头换面的办法保持他们的殖民利益。与此同时，美帝国主义者正在乘机打进非洲，企图夺取老牌殖民主义者的地位而代之。他们企图在“经济援助”的名义下，把新的殖民主义枷锁强套在非洲人民的身上。最近，美帝国主义者在联合国旗帜的掩护下，武装干涉刚果的行动最露骨地暴露了美帝国主义是非洲民族独立运动最凶恶的敌人。帝国主义终究是帝国主义，正像豺狼终究是豺狼一样。非洲人民正在从自己的亲身经验中日益深刻地理解到，为了争取和维护自己的民族独立，必须同以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗进行坚持不懈的斗争。
    彭真市长谴责了帝国主义者诽谤和诬蔑非洲人民，大量散布美化帝国主义、殖民主义的谬论。
    他说，非洲在经济上的落后完全是殖民主义、帝国主义的统治所造成的。非洲人民是勇敢的、勤劳的、智慧的。觉醒了的非洲人民在政治上不知道比帝国主义文明多少倍。真正野蛮和落后的正是以美国为首的帝国主义。非洲人民一旦打碎殖民主义、帝国主义者的枷锁、成为自己国家的真正主人的时候，他们就会很快地显示出管理和建设自己的国家的卓越才能、很快地克服经济上的落后状态。新兴的几内亚共和国就是一个榜样。非洲人民不仅有权利，而且完全有能力管理好自己的国家。全世界人民的同情和支持都在反对帝国主义、保卫和争取独立自由的非洲人民的一边。我们相信，只要坚持斗争，伟大的非洲人民一定能够不断从胜利走向胜利。
    彭真市长说，中国和几内亚两国人民之间有着深厚的手足之情。在反对帝国主义、维护民族独立和争取世界和平的共同事业中，我们两国人民是休戚相关、互相支持的。六亿五千万中国人民过去、现在和将来都是几内亚和全体非洲人民最可靠的朋友。
    塞古·杜尔总统在雷鸣般的掌声中讲话。他说，各国人民目前进行的反对帝国主义的斗争，使得人类为争取社会、经济和文化的福利而进行的斗争具有更大的价值。
    塞古·杜尔总统在讲到各国人民反对帝国主义的斗争时，他指出，这是正义和非正义之间的斗争，是自由和奴役之间的斗争，是进步和反动之间的斗争。他说，我们可以断言，不管相互之间的斗争要持续多久，它只能有一方获得胜利，那就是只能是人民力量的一方获得胜利。
    塞古·杜尔总统谴责野蛮的帝国主义和殖民主义对非洲的奴役、歧视和压迫。他说，帝国主义者和殖民主义者的种种活动，伤害了非洲各国人民的尊严，激起了非洲各国人民的反抗。非洲革命同帝国主义的保持，是根本对立的。他说，非洲在政治、经济、社会和文化解放的道路上所取得的每一个进步，都意味着帝国主义的失败。
    他说，非洲各国人民之间愈能增进谅解，一致行动组织得愈好，我们的共同斗争将愈能见效，我们大家所时刻关怀的理想：结束帝国主义、结束各式各样的殖民主义、结束封建主义的理想，就将更能迅速地实现。
    杜尔总统说，在非洲、在亚洲、在美洲、在欧洲，在所有人类社会里，反对帝国主义的力量日益壮大；而随着我们相继获得解放、随着我们反对帝国主义的斗争的力量愈来愈强大，执意要在世界上保持非正义的人们的人数和势力将日益削弱。我们说，走向胜利的道路不再是漫长的了。
    塞古·杜尔总统说，我们的朋友、北京市市长把帝国主义比作豺狼，是非常正确的。诚然，如果它愿意的话，豺狼可以改变它的外表，可以改变它的语言，可以改变它的位置，但是它的本性是决计改变不了的，也就是说决计改变不了它对待山羊的行动。
    塞古·杜尔总统表示要把中国人民的问候、情意和友谊带给非洲人民。他说，不仅如此，我们还将尽力要和你们在一起，为同一个事业而进行同一个斗争。
    彭真市长和塞古·杜尔总统的讲话，受到极其热烈的欢迎，不断为暴风雨般的鼓掌声所打断。
    讲话以后，彭真市长代表首都各界人民，在欢乐的乐曲声和震天动地的欢呼声中，向塞古·杜尔总统献旗献礼。当塞古·杜尔总统从彭真市长手中接过绣着“向英雄的几内亚人民及其领袖塞古·杜尔总统致敬！祝中国和几内亚人民的友谊万古常青！”的锦旗后，同彭真市长紧紧握手。
    大会宣布结束，刘少奇主席和塞古·杜尔总统在走出会场时，都一再向全场招手致意。这时，人们挥舞着数不清的彩旗和鲜花，“中国和几内亚人民的友谊万岁”的口号声，此起彼伏，响彻云霄。（附图片）
