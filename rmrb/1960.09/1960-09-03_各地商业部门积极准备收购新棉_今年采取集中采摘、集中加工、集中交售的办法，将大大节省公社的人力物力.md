Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd. Commercial departments in various locations are actively carrying out preparations for the purchase and processing of new cotton, welcoming the upcoming peak season for cotton purchasing.

This year, the rural areas' new cotton purchasing work will universally adopt the previously effective methods of concentrated picking, concentrated processing, and concentrated selling. People's communes in various regions will organize cotton-picking professional teams in combination with the broad masses, to concentrate on picking, drying, and selling after the new cotton matures. Some areas that sell lint are also preparing to appropriately centralize the cotton gins scattered among the production teams according to accounting units to carry out factory-style processing. By doing this, the people's communes will be better able to uniformly arrange the labor force needed for the "three autumn harvests" and complete the cotton delivery tasks quickly and well, while also avoiding the waste of manpower and resources caused by scattered picking, processing, and selling. At present, commercial departments in various places are carrying out a series of preparatory work based on this new approach.

In order to facilitate the communes and production teams to deliver cotton at any time after picking the new cotton, commercial departments in various places have universally increased the number of purchasing outlets. In the main cotton-producing areas of the country, such as Hebei, Shandong, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, and Shanxi, the number of purchasing stations (points) planned to be set up this year has increased compared to last year. Due to the universal increase in purchasing points, the mileage for production teams to deliver cotton is generally within five to ten *li*, which is much shorter than in the past, greatly saving the time and transport capacity of commune members for transporting new cotton. Many cotton-producing areas also implement the method of combining factories and stations, with cotton processing factories also doing purchasing work, so that purchasing and processing can be done simultaneously, reducing links and saving transport capacity.

In order to meet the needs of this year's purchasing work, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangxi, Hubei, and other provinces have all transferred some workers from existing commercial staff or from cotton processing factories to participate in the purchasing work this year. Some areas have also hired some people from the production teams' cotton-selling representatives to temporarily assist in the purchasing. At present, various places have adopted methods such as master-apprentice training and running training courses to train this group of people. In order to enable the broad masses of commune members to master the cotton grading standards and do a good job in democratic evaluation, commercial departments in various places have also helped each production team train two or three or three or four "four-part members" (responsible for guiding the production team to pick, dry, store, and sell according to cotton grades).

Cotton processing departments in various places have also adapted to the situation of concentrated delivery by adjusting their layouts, repairing equipment, and promoting technological innovation results to create conditions for completing processing tasks faster and better. In Shandong Province's Liaocheng Prefecture, commercial departments have, on the one hand, appropriately centralized the cotton gins scattered among the production teams and built and expanded seventeen small cotton processing factories. On the other hand, they have carried out a technological transformation of the 29 existing processing factories in the entire area. Among them, 27 processing factories have realized mechanized continuous production from the outflow of seed cotton to the packaging of lint, from the feeding of cottonseed to the packaging of short绒, and from the crushing of raw materials to the production of oil and cake. In Hebei Province, out of 181 cotton processing factories, the equipment of 92 factories had been completely repaired by the end of July. Through the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, most of the factories in the province have realized a one-stop production line for ginning, packaging, delinting, and oil pressing. In addition, many cotton-producing areas have also promoted a large number of new types of machines such as cotton boll stripping machines and cotton boll harvesting machines to speed up the boll stripping work in the later stages of purchasing and save rural labor.

    各地商业部门积极准备收购新棉
    今年采取集中采摘、集中加工、集中交售的办法，将大大节省公社的人力物力
    新华社2日讯　各地商业部门正在积极进行新棉收购和加工的准备工作，迎接即将到来的棉花收购旺季。
    今年农村的新棉收购工作将普遍采取过去已行之有效的集中采摘、集中加工、集中交售的办法。各地人民公社将组织摘棉专业队和广大群众相结合，在新棉成熟后，集中采摘，集中晾晒，集中交售；有些出售皮棉的地区也准备按核算单位把分散在生产小队的轧花机适当集中起来进行加工，实现加工工厂化。这样作，人民公社就能更好的统一安排“三秋”所需要的劳动力，又快又好地完成棉花交售任务，同时也避免了分散采摘、分散加工和分散交售所造成的人力物力的浪费。目前各地商业部门正在根据这一新的做法，进行一系列准备工作。
    为了便于公社和生产队在采摘新棉后，随时交售，各地商业部门普遍增设了收购网点。全国主要产棉区河北、山东、陕西、浙江、山西等八省，今年计划设置的收购站（点）都比去年有所增加。由于普遍增设了收购点，生产队交售棉花的里程一般在五华里到十华里以内，比过去缩短了很多，大大节省了社员运送新棉的时间和运力。还有不少产棉区实行厂站合一的办法，棉花加工厂兼做收购工作，这样就可以随收购、随加工，减少了环节，节省了运力。
    为了适应今年收购工作的需要，河北、山西、山东、江西、湖北等省，今年都从现有商业职工中调配或从棉花加工厂抽调一部分工人参加收购工作，也有的地区从生产队的售棉代表中聘请一部分人临时协助收购。目前各地已采取师傅带徒弟、开办训练班等方式，对这批人员进行了训练。为了使广大社员掌握棉花分级标准，做好民主评级工作，各地商业部门还帮助每个生产队训练了二、三个或三、四个“四分员”（负责指导生产队按棉花等级分摘、分晒、分存、分售）。
    各地棉花加工部门适应集中交售的形势，也纷纷调整布局、检修设备、推广技术革新成果，为更快、更好地完成加工任务创造条件。山东省聊城专区商业部门一方面把分散在生产小队的轧花机适当地集中起来，新建和扩建了十七个小型棉花加工厂，另一方面对全区现有的二十九个加工厂普遍进行了一次技术改造，其中有二十七个加工厂从籽棉出仓到皮棉打包，从棉籽进料到短绒包装，从原料粉碎到出油出饼，全部实现了机械化连续生产。河北省的一百八十一个棉花加工厂，到7月底已有九十二个厂的设备全部检修完毕，通过技术革新和技术革命运动，全省大部分工厂已经实现了轧花、打包、脱绒、榨油生产一条龙。此外，不少产棉区还推广了大批剥棉桃机、棉桃收割机等新型机具，以便加快收购后期的棉桃剥制工作，节约农村劳动力。
