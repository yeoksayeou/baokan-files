    Today, President Sékou Touré of the Republic of Guinea and Speaker of the National Assembly Diallo Saifoulaye, along with other distinguished Guinean guests, arrive in our country for a friendly visit at the invitation of Chairman Liu Shaoqi of our country. The entire Chinese people are excited by this good news. Although the sunlight in subtropical and temperate China is not as intense as in tropical Africa, President Sékou Touré, as soon as you set foot on the soil of the People's Republic of China, you will surely feel that six hundred and fifty million hearts are welcoming your arrival more warmly than the sunshine. We would like to take this good opportunity to extend our cordial greetings and high respect to you, and through you to the hardworking, brave, intelligent, and friendly Guinean people.
    President Touré is an outstanding leader of the Guinean people and a prominent statesman of contemporary Africa. Under the leadership of President Touré, the Guinean people waged a long and unyielding struggle against the French colonialists, and finally established the independent and free Republic of Guinea two years ago. The facts of the past two years have proved that the existence and growth of a new and independent Guinea has greatly encouraged the struggle of the peoples of African countries against colonialism and for national independence, and accelerated the collapse of the imperialist colonial system.
    Over the past two years, the Chinese people have been watching with great admiration the achievements of the Guinean people on the road of independent development. The Guinean people's firm will to resolutely safeguard national independence has won the respect of the people all over the world. When the Guinean people became independent, the French colonialists attempted to strangle her economically. They withdrew their technicians and teachers from Guinea, looted the funds plundered in Guinea, and stopped import and export trade with Guinea. They attempted to use these methods to create economic chaos in Guinea. However, Guinea did not bow its head in the face of difficulties. Relying on the unity of the people throughout the country, and relying on the support of the people of Africa and the world, the Guinean government and people successfully overcame the difficulties and forged ahead bravely. Subsequently, the Guinean people successively crushed the subversion conspiracies plotted by imperialism. After independence, the Guinean government and people took a series of resolute measures to safeguard and develop their own independence, and carried out arduous struggles to eliminate the political and economic forces of imperialism and colonialism, thus setting a brilliant example for the national independence movement in Africa.
    At present, Africa is showing a very good situation. On nearly two-thirds of the land in Africa, the African people, who account for three-fifths of the total African population, have already achieved independent status. The call for the realization of complete national independence is resounding throughout the African continent today. Imperialism can no longer maintain its barbaric colonial system in Africa. However, imperialism is not reconciled to its defeat, and it is carrying out an increasingly frantic death struggle in Africa. Under this situation, the independent Guinean people have always regarded supporting the struggle of the peoples of African countries as their sacred duty. From the first day of the establishment of the Republic of Guinea, the Guinean people, under the leadership of President Touré, bravely extended a helping hand to their African brothers. The Guinean government and people have consistently and resolutely supported the heroic struggle of the Algerian people for independence, the struggle of the Cameroonian people against French colonial suppression, the struggle of the South African people against racial discrimination, and the struggle of the Congolese people againstimperialist aggression and in defense of national independence, making a significant contribution to the cause of African independence and unity.
    The Guinean government and people adhere to a policy of independence, autonomy, peace, and neutrality, and have actively established and developed friendly cooperative relations with socialist countries. To date, Guinea has established diplomatic relations with socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, China, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Vietnam, and Mongolia, and has mutually recognized the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Guinea is constantly developing economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation with socialist countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The efforts made by the Guinean government and people to develop friendly cooperative relations with socialist countries are not only in line with Guinea's national interests, but also conducive to strengthening the cause of world peace.
    The Chinese people are very pleased to see that in the two years since Guinea's independence, the friendly relations between China and Guinea have developed greatly. The friendship between the Chinese and Guinean peoples has been continuously enhanced. Our friendship is based on the common foundation of opposing imperialism and colonialism, safeguarding national independence, and defending the cause of world peace. Therefore, the development of this friendship is hated by imperialism and welcomed by all peace-loving people in the world. The Chinese and Guinean peoples equally cherish their independence, love world peace; equally oppose the aggression and enslavement of imperialism and colonialism, support the struggle of the peoples of Asian and African countries to strive for and safeguard national independence; and equally strive to continuously strengthen the cause of solidarity among the Asian and African peoples. The Chinese government and people resolutely support all struggles of the Guinean people and the peoples of African countries against imperialism and colonialism, and for striving for and safeguarding national independence. As President Touré said at a Guinean domestic gathering: "The Chinese government and people are true friends of the peoples of African countries and the Guinean people." We firmly believe that President Touré's visit to our country will further promote the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Guinea, and further consolidate and develop the militant friendship established between our two peoples in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism and in defense of world peace. The friendship between the Chinese and Guinean peoples, the friendship between the Chinese and African peoples, will forever be like a surging river, flowing endlessly, and forever like the rising sun in the East, radiating immortal brilliance!

    热烈地欢迎您，塞古·杜尔总统
    今天，几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔和国民议会议长迪阿洛·塞福拉耶偕同几内亚的其他贵宾，应我国刘少奇主席的邀请，到达我国进行友好访问，全中国人民都为这个喜讯而感到兴奋。虽然，在亚热带和温带的中国，阳光没有像热带非洲那样强烈，但，塞古·杜尔总统，当你一踏上中华人民共和国的国土，你一定会感觉到，六亿五千万颗心，比阳光还要热烈地迎接着你的光临。我们愿意趁此良好的机会向你，并且通过你向勤劳、勇敢、智慧和充满着对中国人民的友好感情的几内亚人民，致以亲切的问候和崇高的敬意。
    杜尔总统是几内亚人民的卓越领袖，当代非洲的杰出的政治家。几内亚人民在杜尔总统的领导下，同法国殖民者进行了长期不屈不挠的斗争，终于在两年以前建成了独立和自由的几内亚共和国。两年来的事实证明，一个新的独立的几内亚的存在和她的发展壮大，极大地鼓舞了非洲各国人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争，加速了帝国主义殖民体系的崩溃。
    这两年来，中国人民以十分钦佩的心情，注视着几内亚人民在独立发展的道路上所取得的成就。几内亚人民坚决维护民族独立的坚强意志，赢得了全世界人民的尊敬。当几内亚人民独立之时，法国殖民者企图从经济上扼杀她，他们撤走了在几内亚的技术人员和教师，劫走了在几内亚掠夺的资金，停止对几内亚的进出口贸易，他们企图用这些手段制造几内亚经济上的混乱局面。但是，几内亚并没有在困难面前低头，依靠全国人民的团结，依靠非洲和全世界人民的支持，几内亚政府和人民胜利地度过了困难，勇往直前。接着，几内亚人民又接连地粉碎了帝国主义策划的颠覆阴谋。几内亚政府和人民在独立之后，采取了一系列维护和发展自己独立的果断措施，为肃清帝国主义和殖民主义的政治经济势力，进行了艰巨的斗争，从而为非洲的民族独立运动树立了一个光辉的榜样。
    目前，非洲正呈现出一片大好形势，在非洲将近三分之二的土地上，占全非人口五分之三的非洲人民已经取得了独立的地位。要求实现彻底民族独立的呼声今天正响彻在整个非洲大陆，帝国主义再也不可能维持它在非洲的野蛮的殖民制度了。但是，帝国主义是不甘心于自己的失败的，它们正在非洲进行着越来越疯狂的垂死挣扎。在这种形势下，独立了的几内亚人民，一直把支援非洲各国人民的斗争，视为自己神圣的职责。从几内亚共和国成立的第一天起，几内亚人民在杜尔总统的领导下，勇敢地向非洲兄弟伸出支援的双手。几内亚政府和人民一贯地坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的英勇斗争，支持喀麦隆人民反抗法国殖民镇压的斗争，支持南非人民的反种族歧视的斗争，支持刚果人民反对帝国主义侵略和保卫祖国独立的斗争，对于非洲人民的独立和团结的事业，作出了重大的贡献。
    几内亚政府和人民坚持奉行独立自主与和平中立的政策，并且积极地同社会主义国家建立和发展了友好合作关系。迄今为止，几内亚已经同苏联、中国、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、越南、蒙古等社会主义国家建立了外交关系，并且已同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国相互承认。几内亚同社会主义各国在平等互利的基础上不断地发展着经济和文化的交流和合作。几内亚政府和人民为发展同社会主义国家友好合作关系所作的努力，不仅符合于几内亚的民族利益，而且也有利于加强世界和平的事业。
    中国人民非常高兴地看到，在几内亚独立后的两年以来，中国和几内亚两国之间的友好关系，得到了很大的发展。中国和几内亚人民之间的友谊得到了不断的增进。我们的友谊，是建立在反对帝国主义和殖民主义，维护民族独立和保卫世界和平事业的共同基础之上的，因此，这种友谊的发展，为帝国主义所憎恨，而为全世界一切爱好和平的人民所欢迎。中国和几内亚人民同样珍视自己的独立，热爱世界的和平；同样反对帝国主义和殖民主义的侵略和奴役，支持亚洲和非洲各国人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争；同样为不断加强亚非人民的团结事业而奋斗。中国政府和人民坚决支持几内亚人民和非洲各国人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立的一切斗争。正如杜尔总统在一次几内亚国内的集会上所说的：“中国政府和人民是非洲各国人民和几内亚人民的真正朋友。”我们完全相信，杜尔总统这一次访问我国，必将进一步促进中几两国的友好和合作关系，进一步巩固和发展我们两国人民在反对帝国主义和殖民主义，维护世界和平的斗争中建立起来的战斗的友谊。中国和几内亚人民之间的友谊，中国和非洲各国人民之间的友谊，将永远像滔滔江河，长流不息，永远像东方旭日，放射出不灭的光辉！
