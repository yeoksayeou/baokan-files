Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Dispatch: Sichuan Province's mining industry departments are deeply engaged in a mass movement of technical innovation and revolution centered on achieving transportation "New Five-izations," rapidly upgrading short-distance transportation "small indigenous groups" in mines and between mines and blast furnaces to meet the needs of increased steel production.

Vigorously promoting underground and surface transportation linkage, automation, dual-tracking, train-formation, and ball-bearing-ization - the "New Five-izations" movement - is the fundamental measure Sichuan Province is currently taking to break through the bottleneck of short-distance mine transportation. Since last year, due to the implementation of technical innovation and revolution in transportation tools throughout the province's mines, transportation has generally achieved track-ization, cart-ization, ship-ization, cableway-ization, and chute-ization, powerfully guaranteeing the sustained leap forward in steel production. However, with the continuous innovation of mining technology and the further transformation of the smelting system, the output of coal and iron mines and the demand for smelting have greatly increased, requiring further strengthening of transportation work. In response to this situation, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, while organizing increased steel production, mobilized mines in various regions to carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution on the basis of the already achieved transportation "Five-izations," and immediately launched a "New Five-izations" mass movement to comprehensively accelerate the technical transformation and construction of the transportation system, focusing on solving problems such as multiple transportation transfer links in mining areas, small line load capacity, low transportation volume, and low efficiency.

At present, Mianyang, Leshan, Neijiang, Yibin, Dazhou and other key coal and iron producing regions in the province have had a number of mines that have realized or partially realized "New Five-izations," ensuring that ore and coal coke are transported from the production area to the blast furnace in one go. Workers at the Weiyuan Tapsui Iron Plant vigorously promoted the internal and external transportation of the smelting system and mines, newly built seventeen iron-wood tracks, twenty-two cableways, two flat tracks, as well as winches, chutes, etc., and interconnected various new and old machines configured in various transportation links to form a "one-dragon" continuous transportation line. The average daily transportation volume per person increased by two times compared to the past, and the transportation cost was reduced by 42%, making the blast furnace more than adequately supplied.

In the work of further transforming and upgrading mine transportation lines, all regions have adhered to the spirit of combining transformation of old equipment and creation of new ones, adopting a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, carrying out technical innovation and revolution, conquering high mountains and dangerous roads, and configuring various transportation tools in accordance with local conditions. The Zhuyuanba Iron Plant and Shizi Mining Area in Guangyuan County are located on a high mountain more than two thousand meters above sea level, more than fifty li away from the smelting workshop. On the way, they have to cross several steep mountains, pass through several canyons and a river with many shoals and rapid water, making transportation very difficult. In the "New Five-izations" movement, the workers adopted the method of key team formation, setting projects, setting time limits, assigning responsibilities by division, and concentrating on breakthroughs. They only spent two days and nights to change the road from steep to flat, and from curved to straight; in the loading and unloading methods, manual operation was also changed to trestle-type multi-slot funnel automatic loading and unloading, which increased transportation efficiency by four to nine times. After the loading and unloading key breakthrough, the mine workers turned the spearhead of technical innovation to the underground, changing single tracks to double tracks, and wooden tracks to iron-wood tracks; the workers responsible for ground and river transportation also launched a labor competition of "one plan for each person, and everyone is red with innovation," greatly changing the shape of the boats and repairing the river channels, changing hand-cranked wooden boats to foot-pedaled wooden boats, reducing the labor force per boat by half, increasing the loading capacity from four tons to six to ten tons, and increasing the speed by 40%. Now the entire plant has fully realized the linkage, train-formation, dual-tracking, and automatic loading and unloading of water and land transportation from the mine to the smelting workshop. The ore can be transported directly from the wellhead to the furnace side without landing. At present, the furnace side has already reserved a month's worth of "surplus grain." (Attached picture)

　　加速矿山运输系统技术改造　适应钢铁增产需要
　　四川采掘部门开展运输“新五化”运动
　　要求实现运输联动化、自动化、双轨化、列车化和滚珠化，使矿石、煤焦从产区到高炉一次运到底
    据新华社成都电　四川省采掘工业部门正在深入开展以实现运输“新五化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命群众运动，使矿区和矿区到高炉之间的运输“小土群”迅速提高升级，以适应钢铁增产的需要。
    大搞井下和地面运输联动化、自动化、双轨化、列车化和滚珠轴承化的“新五化”运动，是四川省当前突破矿山短途运输关的根本措施。去年以来，全省各矿山由于开展了运输工具的技术革新和技术革命，普遍达到了运输轨道化、车子化、船运化、索道化、溜槽化，有力地保证了钢铁生产的持续跃进。但是，随着矿山开采技术的不断革新和冶炼系统的进一步改造，煤矿铁矿产量和冶炼需要量都大大增加，要求运输工作进一步加强。针对这种情况，中共四川省委在组织钢铁增产的同时，动员各地矿山在已经达到的运输“五化”的基础上，发扬不断革命精神，立即开展一个“新五化”群众运动，全面加速运输系统的技术改造和建设，着重解决矿区运输转运环节多、线路载重能力小、运量少、效率较低等问题。
    目前，全省煤铁重点产地的绵阳、乐山、内江、宜宾、达县等专区，已有一批矿山实现或部分实现了“新五化”，使矿石、煤焦从产区到高炉一次运到底。威远沓水铁厂职工大搞冶炼系统和矿山的内外运输，新修了十七条铁木轨道、二十二条索道、两条平道，以及绞车、梭槽等，并使各个运输环节配置的各种新旧机具互相衔接，组成了“一条龙”连续运输线，每人每日平均运量比过去提高两倍，运输成本降低42％，使高炉吃饱有余。
    在进一步改造提高矿山运输线的工作中，各地都本着改旧和创制相结合的精神，采取土洋结合的办法，开展技术革新和技术革命，征服高山险路，因地制宜地配置各种运输工具。广元县竹元坝铁厂和石子矿区位于拔海两千多米的高山上，离冶炼车间五十多华里，途中要翻越几座峻岭，通过几条峡谷和一条滩多水急的河流，运输困难很大。在“新五化”运动中，职工们采取关键排队，定项目，定时间，分口包干，集中突击的办法，只经过两昼夜就把道路由陡改平，由弯改直；在装卸方法上也由手工操作改成了天桥式多槽漏斗自动装卸，使运输效率提高了四至九倍。装卸关键突破以后，矿山职工又把技术革新的矛头指向井下，把单轨改成双轨，木轨改成铁木轨；担负地面和河道运输的职工，也开展了“一人一条计，个个革新红”的劳动竞赛，大改船型，大修河道，把手摇木船改成脚踏式木船，使每只船劳力减少一半，装载量由四吨增加到六至十吨，航速提高了40％。现在全厂从矿山到冶炼车间已全部实现了水陆运输联动化、列车化、双轨化、装卸自动化，矿石不落地就可从井口一直运到炉边。目前炉边已经储备了一个月的“余粮”。（附图片）
