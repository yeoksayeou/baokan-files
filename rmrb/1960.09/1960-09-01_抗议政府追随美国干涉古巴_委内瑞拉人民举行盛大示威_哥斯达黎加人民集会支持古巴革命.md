Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, 30th—People from all walks of life in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, held a large-scale demonstration on the afternoon of the 29th to condemn the United States for imposing a resolution on interfering with Cuba on the member foreign ministers' meeting of the Organization of American States, and to protest the Venezuelan government's directive to its delegation to sign the resolution. The demonstration continued until late at night.
	On that day, the masses from all districts of Caracas held up large-scale propaganda paintings and banners expressing support for the Cuban revolution, and chanted slogans such as "Cuba, yes, Yankees, no," and thronged to the city center. Police and National Guard troops threw tear gas at the demonstrators and fired at them. The demonstrators retreated in an orderly manner to various districts of the capital, erected barricades, burned a small truck belonging to the right-wing newspaper "El Mundo" which opposed the Cuban revolution, and attacked another newspaper, "El Universal", which also opposed the Cuban revolution. The demonstrators did not remove the barricades and return to their respective areas until twelve o'clock in the evening.
	According to the Venezuelan authorities, one person was killed, more than twenty were injured, and some were arrested in the incident.

	Xinhua News Agency, 31st—San José dispatch: A grand rally was held in San José, the capital of Costa Rica, on the evening of the 29th to bid farewell to the Cuban delegation attending the foreign ministers' meeting of the Organization of American States.
	The conference was held while the entire city of San José was under military curfew. Although the rally was obstructed by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and the authorities, it did not prevent the Costa Rican people from supporting the Cuban revolution.
	Speakers at the conference unanimously condemned the foreign ministers' meeting of the Organization of American States.
	Eduardo Mora, leader of the Costa Rican People's Vanguard Party, said at the meeting, "Neither the US Federal Bureau of Investigation nor the merciless Costa Rican authorities can prevent the people from deeply expressing their support for the Cuban revolution." He said, "In our thirty years of revolutionary struggle, we have never seen the people more united than they are now. Around the Association of Friends of the Cuban Revolution, a broad mass of people and honest leaders of national political parties are united."
	Representatives of various people's organizations presented a gold medal to Cuban Foreign Minister Roa, who defended the sovereignty of the peoples of Latin American countries. In his speech accepting the award, Roa pointed out that the foreign ministers' meeting was a victory for Cuba, "because the meeting turned into an indictment condemning the US policy of aggression against Latin American countries." He expressed his gratitude for the medal awarded to him by the people of Costa Rica.
	In a statement to the press before leaving for home, the Cuban delegation said, "The Cuban delegation is very grateful for and admires the noble Costa Rican people and the countless brave friends who support the Cuban revolution. This support and sympathy are an encouragement to us. We know that the Cuban revolution specifically embodies the legitimate aspirations of the Cuban people for political freedom, economic independence, and social justice, and we also know that this influence is expanding and is summoning all the peoples of the American continent. They have further strengthened our determination, which is specifically expressed in our slogan of victory."

    抗议政府追随美国干涉古巴
    委内瑞拉人民举行盛大示威
    哥斯达黎加人民集会支持古巴革命
    据新华社加拉加斯30日电　委内瑞拉首都加拉加斯的各界人民在29日下午举行大规模的示威游行，谴责美国把干涉古巴的决议强加于美洲国家组织成员国外长会议，并且抗议委内瑞拉政府指令它的代表团签署这项决议。示威游行一直延续到深夜。
    当天，加拉加斯各区的群众高举着表示支持古巴革命的大幅宣传画和标语牌，高呼“要古巴，不要美国佬”等口号，拥向市中心。警察和国民警卫队向示威群众投掷了催泪弹，并且向他们开枪射击。示威群众有秩序地退到首都各区，树起街垒，并且焚烧了一辆属于反对古巴革命的右派报纸“世界报”的小卡车，袭击了另一家反对古巴革命的报纸“环球报”。示威群众到晚间十二点才撤掉街垒，回到各个地区。
    据委内瑞拉当局宣布，在这次事件中，有一人被打死，二十多人被打伤，还有一些人遭到逮捕。
    据新华社31日讯　圣约瑟消息：哥斯达黎加首都圣约瑟29日晚上举行盛大集会，向参加美洲国家组织外长会议的古巴代表团告别。
    这次大会是在圣约瑟全城处于军事戒严状态下召开的。尽管这次集会遭到美国联邦调查局和当局的阻挠，但没能阻止哥斯达黎加人民支援古巴革命的行动。
    在大会上发言的人一致谴责美洲国家组织外长会议。
    哥斯达黎加人民先锋党领导人爱德华多·莫拉在会上说，“不论是美国联邦调查局，还是毫不容情的哥斯达黎加当局，都不能阻止人民深深地表达他们对古巴革命的支持。”他说，“我们在三十年的革命战斗中还没有看到过人民比现在更加团结一致。在古巴革命之友协会的周围，团结了广大的人民群众和全国各政党的正直的领导人”。
    各人民团体的代表在会上把一枚金质奖章赠给捍卫拉丁美洲各国人民主权的古巴外交部长罗亚。罗亚在答谢群众的讲话中指出，这次外长会议是古巴的一次胜利，“因为这次会议变成了谴责美国对拉丁美洲各国的侵略政策的控诉大会”。他表示感谢哥斯达黎加人民授给他的奖章。
    古巴代表团在启程回国前向报界发表的声明说，“古巴代表团十分感激地钦佩和感谢崇高的哥斯达黎加人民和支持古巴革命的无数勇敢的朋友们，这些支援和同情是对我们的鼓舞。我们知道，古巴革命具体体现着古巴人民的政治自由、经济独立和社会正义这些正当的愿望，我们也知道这种影响正在扩大，正在召唤着美洲大陆的全体人民。他们更加坚定了我们的决心，这个决心具体表现为我们必胜的口号。”
