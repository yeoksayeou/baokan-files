Why are the Vegetables Grown So Well in the Xueji Commune?
Jiao Dexiu, First Secretary of the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

On July 15th, we arrived at Qinji Town in the Xueji Commune of Guanghua County. The streets were lined with melons and vegetables on both sides. Eggplants, gourds, pumpkins, winter melons, cowpeas, string beans, amaranth, peppers, garlic, chives... there were one or two dozen kinds, over a hundred dan [a unit of weight, about 50 kg]. These vegetables were all grown by nearby production teams and small teams, and they brought what they couldn't eat themselves to sell.

This commune has over one hundred and forty canteens, and each canteen has established a vegetable base, averaging about one fen [a unit of area, about 667 square meters] per person. In addition, each production team has a vegetable garden for cultivating seeds, imparting technology, and producing commercial vegetables. We visited seven vegetable gardens of advanced production teams. Each vegetable garden had a fixed person in charge, a technician, and members, a small house, a well, a manure pit, a donkey, and a liberation-style waterwheel, with one or two dozen kinds of vegetables. The vegetable gardens throughout the commune were very similar to the vegetable gardens of this team. From the end of April to now this year, the entire commune has harvested more than 7.3 million jin [a unit of weight, about 0.5 kg] of melons and vegetables. The members reflected: "The vegetables in the vegetable garden can't be picked every day; the vegetables picked can't be eaten every day. In addition to fully meeting the canteen's daily vegetable consumption, we also made a lot of dried vegetables and pickled vegetables, and sold more than 900,000 jin, truly achieving enough to eat and more."

Growing vegetables, in itself, is an ordinary thing. However, for this commune, it is a revolution!

Originally, the conditions for growing vegetables in this commune were not good. Flat slopes, heavy clay soil, and a lack of water sources. Before 1957, the members here rarely ate vegetables. In the autumn, they beat down some sesame leaves and sweet potato leaves and mixed them into noodles; when they wanted to eat vegetables during the New Year and festivals, they went to Laohekou Town, dozens of miles away, or to Xinye and Deng Counties in Henan to buy them. People said, "Vegetables simply can't be grown here. Our ancestors didn't have the habit of eating vegetables."

After the establishment of the People's Commune, canteens were generally established in each small team. According to the instructions of the provincial and prefectural committees, the commune party committee repeatedly emphasized the establishment of vegetable bases. However, before gaining new practical experience, it was difficult to break the old habits. Some production teams and production small teams planted a little bit sporadically on the village walls and barren fields, and some did not plant at all. But some teams did plant several mu [a unit of area, about 667 square meters] more seriously.

The cadres of the advanced production team, the Fifth Team, listened to the Party and planted four mu of vegetable land; the captain of the Second Small Team was afraid that growing vegetables would delay production, so he didn't plant even a fen of vegetables. By the spring of 1959, the two small teams launched a production competition. The Fifth Small Team had more vegetables, and the life was better adjusted. All one hundred and five laborers in the team were on duty every day, and one laborer delivered forty-five carts of fertilizer a day; the Second Small Team lost, and the captain hung up a "no war" sign. The members criticized the captain, saying, "You don't listen to the instructions of the superiors, your life is not good, and your production is not as good as others." The members found Jiao Yongtian, the secretary of the management area general branch, who was helping to work there, and asked him to help solve this problem. Jiao Yongtian personally stayed with Zhang Wenzhou, the party branch secretary of the advanced production team, to live in the Second Small Team, assisting them in rushing to plant thirteen mu of vegetables, and determined a team committee member and two members to be specifically responsible for growing vegetables. Without seeds, they sent people to Xiangyang and Deng County in Henan to buy some, and mobilized the members to collect some. Not knowing how to grow vegetables, they went to the Fifth Small Team to learn. In the autumn drought, they dug a permeable well in the field, and finally got a great harvest of vegetables. The vegetables in the Second Small Team were grown well, improved the life, and promoted the production, and became an advanced small team.

The Second Small Team learned from its own practice before it made up its mind to revolutionize the old habit of "not growing vegetables." From not growing vegetables to growing a lot of vegetables, there must be a process of understanding and practice, and many practical difficulties must be solved before it can be realized. It cannot be done by just shouting a few words or making a temporary rush. The Xueji Commune Party Committee understood this principle and held five on-site meetings in the Second Small Team of the advanced production team. Repeatedly disseminating experience, repeatedly checking the implementation, and helping the production teams one by one to specifically study and solve the actual difficulties in growing vegetables, only then did they truly do a good job of growing vegetables.

At the beginning, many cadres couldn't get their minds straight on the issue of fixing people and fixing land. They said, "We can't even take care of the crops, who can take care of so many vegetables? This will affect agricultural production." Many teams were reluctant to take out good land as vegetable bases. The vegetable garden of the improved production team was originally located in the tree space, then changed to the slope, and then changed to the ditch. The inspection was changed once for each inspection. After six inspections, a good piece of land was changed. Now the whole commune has more than 5,700 mu of fixed vegetable bases, exceeding the standard of an average of one fen of vegetable land per person, and each base has a fixed person in charge.

Facts have proved that growing vegetables not only did not affect production, but promoted production. The summer harvest of the entire commune this year increased by 22% compared with last year, and the autumn field management is full of strong seedlings and clean grass.

With people and land, there must also be seeds. In this area, vegetables were not grown in previous years, or very few vegetables were grown. The commune party committee sent fifty-one cadres to other places to buy vegetable seeds; on the one hand, it mobilized members to find vegetable seeds, "buy seeds when they see them, and want seedlings when they see them." Zhang Wencai's wife specially returned to her mother's house in Yunyang County to get six liang [a unit of weight, about 50 grams] of pumpkin seeds and pepper seeds. Comrade Jiao Yongtian brought seeds and vegetable seedlings back every time he went to Laohekou for a meeting, bringing back forty or fifty jin in one spring. Some members took out the seeds of bottle gourds, pillow squashes, and horsetail chives that had been preserved for many years. In order to solve the long-term problem of vegetable seeds, each production team has a vegetable garden dedicated to cultivating seeds, and other vegetable gardens are also arranged to retain seeds, and bamboo branches and wooden sticks are inserted on the vegetables to be retained as a sign. Now, this commune not only does not lack seeds, but has a surplus.

With seeds, it is still not possible if you don't know how to grow them. There are more than six hundred members in the whole commune who grow vegetables, but only more than twenty people know a little about vegetable growing technology. Deng Wenqing, the secretary of the commune party committee, took the lead and led the cadres to the vegetable garden to learn. Jiao Yongtian took the members sixty miles in heavy snow to learn the technology of eight vegetable harvests a year. The commune told them to help others work when they went to other places to learn technology. In this way, more than three hundred members above the level of small team leader in the whole commune learned the technology of growing vegetables within a year. How many grains of radish seeds are there in one jin, how many plants are planted per mu, when to plant, when to harvest, how to cultivate and manage, etc., they are as skilled as growing crops.

Growing vegetables also requires water. There was no habit of digging wells here. Deng Wenqing and Jiao Yongtian took cadres and members to Henan to visit. Back, Deng Wenqing and Jiao Yongtian led the members of the First Small Team of the advanced production team to fight hard for seven days and dug out a spring of water as thick as a bowl, which could irrigate twenty mu of gardens. The commune party committee held a meeting next to the well, disseminating their experience on the spot, and asked the small teams to dig underground water sources according to local conditions. Dig permeable wells near the ponds; dig deep wells near reservoirs and weirs; and carry out self-flowing irrigation in vegetable gardens. In less than half a month, the whole commune had three hundred and five newly dug and repaired water wells, which basically solved the problem of water for vegetable gardens.

With the water problem solved, the fertilizer problem became prominent again. Each production team and small team built manure pits in the vegetable garden, stipulated special fertilizer for vegetable land, and assigned an elderly member to specifically pick manure and beat Artemisia annua for the vegetable garden, accumulating it on the spot, creating it on the spot, and using it on the spot. Jianqiang Production Team also used the vegetable leaves and melon vines in the vegetable garden to raise sixteen pigs to accumulate fertilizer and create fertilizer.

The experience of the Xueji Commune Party Committee in leading vegetable growing is to do a series of meticulous organizational work, grasp the thinking and grasp the technology, grab it and not let go, grasp it tightly, grasp it hard, and grasp it to the end, and the problem will be solved.

    薛集公社的菜为什么种得好？
    中共襄阳地委第一书记　焦德秀
    7月15日，我们来到光化县薛集公社的秦集镇。一街两行，摆满了瓜瓜菜菜。什么茄子、葫子、南瓜、冬瓜、豇豆、四季豆、苋菜、辣椒、大蒜、韭菜……有一、二十种，一百多担。这些菜，都是附近生产队和小队种的，自己吃不完，挑来卖的。
    这个公社有一百四十几个食堂，每个食堂都建立了蔬菜基地，平均每人有一分左右。除此以外，每个生产队还有一个培育种子、传授技术、生产商品菜的菜园。我们参观了先进生产队的七个菜园，每个菜园都固定有负责人、技术员和社员，有一座小房子，一眼井，一口粪池，一头毛驴，一架解放式水车，有一、二十种菜。全公社的菜园，都和这个队的菜园大同小异。从今年4月底到现在，全公社共收瓜菜七百三十多万斤。社员们反映：“菜园里的菜，天天摘不完；摘回来的菜，天天吃不了，除充分满足当天食堂吃菜外，还做了很多干菜、腌菜，卖了九十多万斤，真正做到够吃有余了。”
    种菜，说起来是一件普通的事情。可是，对这个公社来说，却是一场革命！
    原来，这个公社种菜的条件并不好。平岗地，重粘土，缺水源。1957年以前，这里的社员还很少吃菜，秋天打一点芝麻叶、红薯叶，和到面条里吃；逢年过节要吃菜，就到几十里外的老河口镇、到河南的新野、邓县去买。人们说：“这里根本种不成菜，老祖宗都没有吃菜的习惯。”
    在人民公社成立以后，各小队都普遍建立了食堂。公社党委根据省、地委指示，三番五次地强调建立蔬菜基地。可是，在取得新的实践经验之前，旧的习惯势力是很难打破的。有些生产队、生产小队在寨墙上、荒场里零零星星种了一点，有的根本没有种。但是也有一些队比较认真地种了几亩。
    先进生产队第五队的干部听党的话，种了四亩菜地；二小队队长怕种菜耽误生产，一分菜也不种。到1959年春，两个小队开展生产竞赛，五小队菜多，生活调剂得好，全队一百零五个劳动力，天天出勤，一个劳动力一天送肥四十五车；二小队输了，小队长挂上免战牌。社员批评小队长说：“你不听上级的话，生活搞得不好，生产也比不上人家。”社员们找到在那里帮助工作的管理区总支书记焦永田，要他帮助解决这个问题。焦永田亲自和先进生产队的党支部书记张文周一起住到二小队，协助他们抢种了十三亩菜，确定了一个队委和两个社员专门负责种菜。没有种子，派人到襄阳和河南的邓县买了一些，动员社员凑了一些。不会种菜技术，到五小队去学。秋旱，在地头挖了个透水井，终于得到了蔬菜大丰收。二小队的菜种得好，改善了生活，促进了生产，变成了一个先进小队。
    二小队是从自己的实践当中得到教训，才下定决心，革掉了“不种菜”这个旧习惯的命的。从不种菜到大种菜，要有一个认识和实践的过程，要解决许多实际困难，才能够实现。不是一般的叫喊一下，临时突击一下，就能作到的。薛集公社党委认识了这个道理，在先进生产队第二小队先后开了五次现场会。反复传播经验，反复检查贯彻，并且对种菜的实际困难，帮助生产队一个一个地具体研究，具体解决，才把种菜这件事真正作好了。
    开头，在定人定地问题上，好多干部思想搞不通。他们说：“连庄稼都忙不过来，谁还顾得上种那么多的菜，这要影响农业生产。”不少队都舍不得拿出好地当蔬菜基地。改进生产队的菜园，原先确定在树空里，后来改在坡地，后来又换到沟边洼地里。检查一次换一次，前后检查了六次，才换了一块好地。现在全社已固定的蔬菜基地有五千七百多亩，超过了每人平均一分菜地的标准，而且每个基地都固定有专人负责。
    事实证明，种菜不仅没有影响生产，反而促进了生产。全公社今年夏收比去年增加22％，秋季田间管理块块都是苗旺草净。
    有了人，有了地，还要有种子。这个地区，往年不种菜，即或种菜也很少。公社党委一面派了五十一个干部到外地去买菜种；一面发动社员人人找菜种，“见种就买，见苗就要”。社员张文才的爱人特地回郧阳县娘家去弄回六两南瓜种和辣椒种。焦永田同志每次到老河口开会都带种子、菜苗回来，一个春上就带回了四、五十斤。有的社员保存了多年的布袋葫子、枕头笋瓜、马尾韭菜等种都拿出来了。为了解决长远的菜种问题，每个生产队都有一个菜园专门培育种子，其他的菜园也都布置有留种任务，把要留种的菜，插上竹枝、木棍，作为标记。现在，这个公社不仅不缺种子，而且有多余的了。
    有了种子，不会种还是不行。全公社六百多个种菜的社员，总共不过二十多人懂得点种菜技术。公社党委书记邓文清带头领着干部到菜园去学。焦永田大雪天带着社员跑了六十里路，去学蔬菜一年八收的技术。公社告诉他们到外地学技术时，要帮人家作工。就这样，全公社小队长以上的干部和三百多个社员，一年内都学会了种菜的技术。一斤萝卜子有多少粒，一亩地种多少棵，什么时候种，什么时候收，如何培育管理，等等，他们都像种庄稼一样的熟练。
    种菜，还要有水。这里原来没有打井的习惯，邓文清和焦永田就带着干部和社员到河南去参观。回来邓文清和焦永田就在先进生产队一小队带领社员苦战七天，挖出一股碗口粗的泉水，能浇二十亩园子。公社党委就在井旁开会，现场传播他们的经验，要求各小队因地制宜挖掘地下水源。靠水塘边，就挖透水井；靠水库、堰塘的，就挖深水井；大搞菜园自流灌溉。不到半个月，全公社新打和补修的水井就有三百零五眼，基本上解决了菜园用水问题。
    水的问题解决了，肥料问题又突出起来了。各个生产队和小队，都在菜园内修建了粪池，规定了菜地专用肥，并指派一个老年社员专门为菜园拣粪、打青蒿，就地积，就地造，就地用。建强生产队还利用菜园的菜叶、瓜秧，在菜园里养了十六头猪积肥造肥。
    薛集公社党委领导种菜的经验，就是作了一系列的细致的组织工作，抓思想，又抓技术，一把抓住不放，抓得紧，抓得狠，一抓到
  底，问题就解决了。
