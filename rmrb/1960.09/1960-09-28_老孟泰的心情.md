　　Old Meng Tai's Mood
　　Yu Min
    In the spring of this year, Old Meng Tai suddenly felt a swelling in his head, a numbness, as if he were wearing a tight headband that caused him pain. "Oh no," he thought, "my brain must be broken." As usual, he really didn't like going to the hospital when he was sick. The hospital was good, and the doctors were good, but treatment took time, which was not good. For him, time was steel. He believed in his willpower. When you're sick, you have to resist it! He refused to admit he was old, but unfortunately, the laws of nature were secretly draining his energy. He was already sixty-three years old, and although his heart was as warm as a young man's, his legs couldn't help but tremble and his chest felt a little breathless when he climbed up the blast furnace.

    After a few days, the root of his illness was found. It turned out to be high blood pressure. At the insistence of the Party Committee of the Iron and Steel Plant, he was hospitalized.

    August is the rainy season in the north. The bright and beautiful Taizi River roared and flooded, causing a once-in-a-century flood. The raw material transportation of Anshan Iron and Steel suddenly stopped, which was a fatal threat to steel production. In those days, Meng Tai was both pained and angry. Man can conquer nature! How could he allow himself to be trapped here, watching the dark, pot-like sky and listening to the torrential rain, powerless! Anshan Iron and Steel raised a red flag last year, which was a red flag for adhering to the Party's leadership and vigorously promoting mass movements in large enterprises. The joint technical performance competition yielded fruitful results and attracted national attention. This year, they strived for a good start, a good first quarter, and overfulfilled the national plan in the first half of the year. Now is the time for the third quarter decisive battle, and they must not be defeated by the flood! He called the factory, but no one answered in the office. Everyone had gone to flood prevention and rescue. At this time, thousands of cadres, workers, and People's Liberation Army soldiers were holding back the flood with their chests and quickly restoring transportation.

    This news comforted him, but also made him more anxious. After the annoying rainy season, how were the blast furnaces? He knew in his heart that his comrades, in order to let him rest in peace, would sometimes report good news but not bad. He had to see it with his own eyes immediately before he could calm his pounding heart. Just then, the Central Committee issued instructions for an increase production and practice economy campaign centered on grain and steel.

    The old worker was happy and smiled. The Central Committee was so wise! It came at the right time. Not only for the whole country, but also for individuals. He had a hundred reasons to be discharged from the hospital early. "Come on, old fellows," he thought, "you can bring a hundred mouths and you won't be able to convince me!" To be honest, after careful treatment in the hospital, his blood pressure had dropped, his head no longer hurt, and the swelling in his legs had subsided. He felt that he was fully capable of participating in the great steelmaking, which was related to the happiness of hundreds of millions of people. He tried to eat a little more every day, pretending to the doctor that he had no health problems at all.

    "Doctor, I feel like I've taken a bath, I feel comfortable from head to toe. Look, (he pressed his calf with his finger) the swelling is gone, right? There's none at all."

    He hid his anxious mood, put on the innocent smile of a three-year-old child, and asked the doctor to be discharged from the hospital. As usual, he promised the doctor that he would come back for a check-up every two days. The doctors were all old acquaintances and knew his tricks, so they advised him to consolidate the treatment and arranged for him to go to Dalian for convalescence. What a serious disagreement!

    As his blood pressure dropped, his anxiety increased day by day. He had already taken on the position of deputy director of the Iron and Steel Plant, specifically in charge of the welfare of the workers. He was originally very reluctant to leave his production post, but fortunately, the Party's instructions on grasping production with one hand and livelihood with the other reassured him. Last year, he vigorously rectified the canteen, put on a white coat himself, and took charge of the ladle. Groups of young workers came to see him, giggling and smiling at him, confident in the improvement of the food. And indeed it was so. During the Spring Festival this year, the workers not only ate dumplings, but also a whole table of banquet dishes. Under Old Meng Tai's management, a 120-mu farm was opened, planted with corn, sorghum, and vegetables, raised more than 160 pigs, hundreds of chickens and ducks, 15 horses with shiny coats tied to the trough, and two large milk cows. He traveled thousands of miles for these things.

    While others were in the smoke and fire, making iron and steel, he was lying on a soft bed covered with white sheets, what was that! Old Meng Tai just couldn't not work, it was his nature. He had thought more than once, what would he do if he really couldn't walk in the future? He would crawl to the iron and steel plant. As long as he was breathing, he would never part with the blast furnace.

    He couldn't sleep peacefully at night. In order to cooperate with the current increase production and practice economy campaign, he was calculating, planning, and fantasizing again. The large canteen and workers' club were being expanded, and he was very worried about the progress of the project. Ten mu of the farm's millet was flooded, which was nothing, but the corn and vegetables had to be done even better to make up for the loss. One milk cow was already producing more than 50 jin of milk every day. The high-heat workers on the night shift could drink four liang of scalding hot milk every day. Another one was already pregnant, and soon the milk production could be doubled. This was fully guaranteed, so he smiled sweetly. What he was most worried about were the fifteen horses, some of which he had painstakingly brought back from Baotou. On that 8,000-li journey, he watched them several times a day, touched them, and personally added fodder to them. Later, one of them contracted a serious infectious disease and died. He was sad for a long time, and since then, the health of the horses had always weighed on his mind. And then there were the pigs and chickens. Currently, Anshan area needed to provide a large amount of grain to support the disaster area, and the pigs and chickens could only be fed with substitute feed, which was also a new problem. He wondered how the machinery factory and fertilizer factory of the Nantai People's Commune were doing now. This spring, he and Wang Chonglun, one representing the Iron and Steel Plant and the other representing the Northern Machinery Repair Plant, went to link up with the commune...

    The person was lying quietly, but his heart was racing. The fire in his heart rose and burned his mouth with sores. The doctor understood him, and in this situation, there was no point in keeping him any longer, so he had to agree to let him be discharged from the hospital first.

    Old Meng Tai was like a bird out of a cage, free to spread its wings and fly.

    The sky had long cleared, and the scorching sun shone on the landscape of Anshan area like a brocade. He flew to the blast furnace. The instructions of the Central Committee had already achieved great results here, and production had been steadily increasing in recent days. However, the raw materials and transportation were still too tight. The whole company, from top to bottom, was focusing on these two key points. The Iron and Steel Plant and the Transportation Department were drawing up a joint operations plan and were about to start a major battle. He could rest assured about this.

    He flew to the construction site of the large canteen. As he expected, the labor discipline here was not good enough. Currently, the canteen was in a temporary shed. How could steel heroes be subjected to this kind of grievance for a long time! He found the person in charge of the engineering company and held a meeting with the workers. He believed in his brothers, and as long as the reasoning was explained clearly, it would not be difficult to move mountains and fill the sea, let alone such a small building. When he came again at 6:30 the next day, the workers were already working. "How is it, are there any difficulties?" "There are no difficulties. Old hero, you wait, we will definitely have a meal here with the workers on National Day." Good, what else was there to say.

    He flew to the farm. ... That night, he nudged Sister Meng and said, "It's a pity you can't support me!" Sister Meng had long known that he had something on his mind. He couldn't hide anything. When he had something to be happy about, he would come home, pat his little granddaughter on the head, hold her in his arms, and chat with her in a babbling voice; when he encountered a tricky matter, he couldn't sit still or stand still, and he would pace around the room. "If you want me to do anything, just say it!" Sister Meng said. "They don't have much experience feeding pigs." "Then can't I go?" "No, if you weren't so sore and achy every day, that would be great." He was satisfied with everything on the farm, except for the pig raising, which he was most worried about. That night he made up his mind that he had to move to the farm for a few days. Only by working with them, sleeping with them on the same kang in the evening, and chatting with them in detail could he figure out the details and help them solve the problems in a practical way. This was not only his style, but also his habit.

    The news of victory temporarily distracted his worries. The Iron and Steel Plant and other fraternal units had already achieved brilliant results. Iron cans and slag cans, which people had always thought could not guarantee on-time transportation. This was one of the major factors affecting steel production. With the cooperation of the workers, this hurdle was broken, and the on-time rate was increased from 42% to 82% in the previous eighteen days. "This shot was a hit," Old Meng Tai was happy, "as long as we twist into a rope, what can stop us?"

    Early that morning, he and Wang Chonglun came to the Nantai People's Commune with a cheerful heart. They had already helped the commune equip a machinery factory and a fertilizer factory, and also helped them train dozens of workers, including fitters, turners, iron casters, and pattern makers. Don't underestimate these children who are not yet twenty years old, they are the first batch of technical workers in the People's Commune, destined to create a new history in the countryside. Ten various types of lathes were humming and rotating, and ten new threshing machines had already been made. When all fifty units were made, the threshing of this commune would be completely mechanized, and manpower and animal power could be freed up for autumn plowing. Meng Tai grew up in the countryside and had a deep feeling for the peasants. As soon as the Party called on industry to support agriculture, he became a pioneer. The great craftsmen of the Iron and Steel Plant and the Machinery Repair Plant all came to help with the making and installation every Sunday, totaling nearly 6,000 workdays, all without pay. Thinking of the century-old plan of the worker-peasant alliance, who would put a few banknotes in their eyes.

    Meng Tai and Wang Chonglun came this time to discuss a new plan with the commune. Look, two national model workers, two representatives of the National People's Congress, were sitting on the same kang with the commune cadres, around a small kang table. What a small room, but what important things they were talking about. The mechanization of irrigation and drainage had basically been completed, the mechanization of threshing was about to be completed, and the next step was to gradually realize electrification and tillage mechanization. They calculated, they planned, every number was digging up the three-thousand-year-old roots of poverty in the countryside, and nurturing the future of communism.

    The afterglow of the sun shone on the large sorghum fields, and the two were sitting on the train on their way home. Everything was very satisfactory, and their relaxed mood needed to be expressed, so they began a long-awaited argument. Wang Chonglun criticized Old Meng Tai for not exercising, and this athletic athlete had a thousand reasons to prove the benefits of exercise. Old Meng Tai, on the other hand, had a thousand arguments disagreeing with the other party. In his opinion, labor was the best exercise. He himself was proof, and he could also cite more than a dozen old workers who had worked all their lives and were now in their seventies and still wanted to continue living. He did not object to others exercising, but everyone must work. Labor was the first need of life. Can you say that exercise is the first need of life? On this issue, it seemed that the two would never agree.

　　老孟泰的心情
　　于敏
    今年春间，老孟泰忽然觉得脑子发胀，发木，好像戴上了紧箍咒那样痛。“糟啦”，他想，“一定是脑子坏了。”像往常一样，他有了病很不爱进医院。医院是好，医生也好，可就是治疗要花时间，这可不好。对于他，时间就是钢铁。他相信自己的意志力。病嘛，就得抗住它！他不服老，无奈自然规律在偷偷抽走他的精力。他已经六十三岁了，虽说像小伙子一样满心里热烘烘的，但是当他爬上高炉的时候，他的两腿却不免发抖，胸口也有点发喘。
    过了些日子，他的病根被找出来了。原来是高血压。在炼铁厂党委的坚持下，他入院了。
    8月是北方霪雨的日子。明媚的太子河咆哮了，泛滥了，造成了百年不遇的大水灾。鞍钢的原料运输突然中断，这对于钢铁生产是致命的威胁。那几天里，孟泰又痛苦，又愤怒。人定胜天嘛。怎么可以让活人圈在这里，眼瞅着黑锅似的天空，耳听着瓢泼似的大雨而无能为力！鞍钢去年插起一面红旗，这是在大企业里坚持党的领导，坚持大搞群众运动的红旗。联合技术表演赛结出了丰硕的果实，吸引了全国的注意。今年争得开门红，首季红，上半年超额完成了国家计划。现在正是第三季决战的时刻，可千万不能败在洪水面前啊！他打电话到厂子去，办公室里却没有人接。人们都去防洪抢险去了。这时正有上千的干部、工人和人民解放军，用胸膛顶住了洪水，迅速恢复了交通。
    这个消息安慰了他，也更使他着急了。经过讨厌的雨季，高炉到底怎么样了？他心里明白，同志们为了叫他安心休养，有时不免报喜不报忧的。他得马上亲眼看看，才放得下这颗蹦蹦跳的心。正在这时候，中央发布了以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动的指示。
    这个老工人高兴了，笑了。中央就是英明嘛。来得正是时候。不但对全国是如此，对个人也是如此。他有了一百个理由提前出院。“来吧，老伙计，”他想，“你们带一百张嘴来也休想说服我！”说实在的，经过医院悉心的治疗，他的血压下降了，头也不痛了，腿上的浮肿也消了。他觉得自己完全有本钱去参加大炼钢铁，这是关乎亿万人的幸福的。他每天尽量多吃一点，当着医生的面装出身体毫无毛病的样子。
    “大夫，我好像洗了个澡，从头到脚都舒服啦。你瞅瞅，（他用指头按一下自己的小腿）浮肿没有了吧？一点也没有啦。”
    他藏起焦灼的心情，装出三岁小孩的天真无邪的笑容，向医生要求出院。像往常一样，他向医生保证每隔两天回来检查一次。医生都是老熟人，都知道他这一套窍门，相反地劝他巩固疗效，并且安排他到大连去休养。真是严重的分歧！
    随着他血压的下降，他的焦急的心情一天天上升了。他早已担当炼铁厂的副厂长，专管职工的生活福利。他本来很不愿意离开生产岗位，幸好党关于一手抓生产、一手抓生活的指示让他定了心。他去年大力整顿了食堂，自己穿起白大衫，亲手去掌杓。年青工人一群群来看他，嘻嘻地向他笑，对于伙食的改善有了信心。事实果然也是如此。今年春节的时候，工人不但吃了饺子，而且吃了整桌面的席。在老孟泰的经营下，开辟了一个一百二十亩地的农场，种了玉米、高粱、蔬菜，养了一百六十多口猪，几百只鸡鸭，槽头上拴着十五匹毛色发光的马，还有两头花毛的大乳牛。为了这些东西，他跑了上千里路呢。
    别人烟里火里，在那儿炼铁炼钢，自己却仰在棉软的铺了白被单的床上，这算什么！老孟泰就是不能不劳动，这是他的性格。他不只一次地想过，将来果真走不动了，那怎么办呢？爬也要爬到炼铁厂去。当他还呼吸着的时候，他决不能和高炉分手。
    他夜里睡不安稳了。为了配合当前的增产节约运动，他又在计算、在筹划、在幻想了。大食堂和职工俱乐部正在扩建，很耽心这项工程的进度。农场的谷子淹了十亩，这不算什么，不过玉米呀，蔬菜呀，一定得搞得更好，来弥补这项损失。一头乳牛已经每天出五十多斤奶。上夜班的高热工人每天可以喝到四两滚烫的牛奶了。另一头已经怀孕，不久奶产量可以提高一倍。这是完全有保证的，因此他甜蜜蜜地笑了。最不放心的是那十五匹马，其中有些是他千辛万苦从包头带回来的。在那八千里的旅途中，他每天几次看它们，摸它们，亲自给它们添草料。后来有一匹患了严重的传染病，死了。他难过了很久，从此马的健康情况也经常揪他的心。还有猪和鸡。当前鞍山地区的粮食要大量支援灾区，猪鸡只能完全用代用饲料，这也是一个新问题。南台人民公社的机械厂和肥料厂，现在也不知怎么样了。今年春天，他和王崇伦，一个代表炼铁厂，一个代表北部机修厂，一起去和公社挂上了钩……
    人静静地躺着，心里可是万马奔腾。心火上升烧得他满嘴里生了口疮。医生是了解他的，在这种情况下再留他也没有好处了，只得同意他先出院。
    老孟泰又像出了笼的鸟儿，自由自在地展翅飞翔了。
    天早已放晴，骄阳照着鞍山地区锦片似的河山。他飞上高炉。中央的指示在这里已经大见成效，这几天生产在稳步上升。只是原料和运输还太紧张。全公司上上下下都在狠抓这两个关键。炼铁厂，炼钢厂，运输部，正订出了联合作战的计划，就要开始攻关的大战。这他可以放心了。
    他飞到大食堂的工地。果然不出他所料，这里的劳动纪律不够好。目前食堂是在一个临时搭的棚子里。怎么能叫钢铁英雄长时间受这种委屈！他找到工程公司的负责人，和工人一起开了大会。他相信自己的弟兄，只要把道理讲明白，移山填海也不难，这么个小建筑算得了什么。当他第二天六点半再来的时候，工人早已经在干活了。“怎么样啊，还有什么困难？”“什么困难也没啦。老英雄你等着吧，国庆节一定叫工友在这里会餐。”好哇，这还有什么说的。
    他飞到农场。……这天夜里，他推一下孟大嫂说：“可惜你不能给我撑腰！”孟大嫂早知道他有心事。他这人什么也藏不住，有了舒心事，回到家来，就拍拍小外孙女的头顶，把她抱在怀里，和她咿呀唔呀说笑个不停；碰到棘手的事，就坐也不是，站也不是，六神无主，在屋子里转磨磨。“要我做什么，你就直说呗！”孟大嫂说。“他们喂猪，经验还是不多呀。”“那我就去不好么？”“不行，你要是不那么天天腰酸腿痛的有多好。”农场的一切他都满意，只有猪的饲养是他最不放心的。这天夜里他下了决心，一定得搬到农场住些日子。只有和他们一起劳动，晚上和他们睡在一盘炕上，细细地唠喀，才能摸清底细，帮他们切切实实地解决问题。这不只是他的作风，也是他的习惯。
    胜利的消息暂时分散了他的忧虑。炼铁厂和各兄弟单位已经取得辉煌的成绩。铁罐和渣罐，人们一向认为不能保证正点运输。这是影响钢铁生产的重大因素之一。在工人们的合作之下，这一关被突破了，正点率由前十八天的42％提到82％。“这一炮打得响，”老孟泰乐了，“只要拧成一股绳，有什么能挡得住咱们？”
    这天一早，他满心舒畅地和王崇伦来到南台人民公社。已经帮助公社装备了一个机械厂，一个肥料厂，也帮助他们培养了几十名工人，有钳工、车工、铸铁工、木型工。别小看这些二十不到的孩子，他们是人民公社第一批技术工人，注定了要在农村创造新的历史。十台各式的床子在嗡嗡地旋转，已经制成十台新型的脱谷机。当全部五十台做成以后，这个公社的脱谷就全部机械化了，就可以腾出人力和畜力去秋耕。孟泰过去生长在农村，对农民有深厚的感情。党一号召工业支援农业，他就成了个急先锋。炼铁厂和机修厂的大工匠，每个星期天都有一批来帮助制做和安装，总计将近有六千个劳动日了，都是不要报酬的。想到工农联盟的百年大计，谁还把几张钱票子放在眼里。
    孟泰和王崇伦二人这一次来，目的是和公社研究新的规划。看吧，两个全国劳动模范，两个全国人民代表大会代表，正和社干部坐在一盘炕上，围着一个小炕桌。多么小的一间屋子，但是他们谈的是多么重大的事。排灌的机械化已经基本上完成了，脱谷的机械化眼看要完成，接下来是逐步实现电气化和耕种机械化。他们核计，他们盘算，每个数目字都在挖掉农村三千年的穷根，孕育共产主义的未来。
    太阳的余辉照在大片高粱地上，这时二人坐在归途的火车上了。一切都很满意，轻松的心情需要有所发抒，于是又开始了好久没有和解的争论。王崇伦批评老孟泰不运动，这个运动健儿有一千个理由证明运动的好处。老孟泰呢，也有一千个论据不同意对方。在他看来，劳动就是最好的运动。他自身就是证据，他也可以举出上十个老工人，他们劳动了一生，现在七十多了，还要继续活下去哩。他不反对别人运动，但是人人必须劳动。劳动是人生第一需要嘛。你能说运动是人生第一需要嗯？在这个问题上，看来二人的意见永远也不会统一了。
