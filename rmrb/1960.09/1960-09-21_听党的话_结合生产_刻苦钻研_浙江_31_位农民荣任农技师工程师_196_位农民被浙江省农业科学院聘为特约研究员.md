According to the Zhejiang Daily: Many farmers and cadres of farmer origin in Zhejiang Province listen to the Party, diligently study in production, and strive to climb the peak of science. Recently, thirty-one of them were honorably appointed as agricultural technicians, aquatic technicians, agricultural machinery engineers, and water conservancy engineers; one hundred and ninety-six were hired as special researchers by the Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences. This is a great joyous event for the people.

In the old society, the working people suffered oppression and exploitation from the ruling class, lost the right to education, and their talents and wisdom were buried. Only under the socialist system do they have the opportunity to engage in scientific research. Agricultural technician Zhang Youfa had the ideal of eliminating the alternate bearing of citrus fruits before liberation, but he had no conditions to conduct experiments. After liberation, the state allocated an experimental citrus orchard to him and sent technicians to help him. With the meticulous care of the Party and the state, he finally realized his long-term ideal. Agricultural technician Wen Xingren has twenty-eight years of valuable experience in preventing seedling rot, but this experience was only truly valued and promoted after liberation. As Wen Xingren himself said: "Twenty-eight years of preventing seedling rot is actually only real skill after liberation. Without the leadership and help of the Party, relying solely on past experience, it would be impossible to guarantee no seedling rot when planting double-cropping rice on a large scale as we do now."

Listening to the Party, diligently studying in completing every task assigned by the Party, and showing a high degree of enthusiasm and responsibility are the common and noble qualities of these new types of agricultural scientific talents. Agricultural technician Zhu Ruixiang regards pig raising as a glorious undertaking for building socialism. She loves pigs as treasures and diligently explores the laws of fattening meat pigs and increasing the number of piglets per sow. With the help of the Party, she created the experience of meat pigs gaining one catty of meat per day and sows producing more piglets. Eradicating bollworms is one of the key measures to increase cotton production. Agricultural technician Zhou Xilin, in response to the Party's call to actively increase the production of industrial raw materials, went to the cotton fields every day to observe the living habits of bollworms, and conducted research while neglecting food and sleep, and finally created a new method to eliminate bollworms.

These people, from ordinary farmers to agricultural scientific workers, have diligently studied and overcome various difficulties with tenacious perseverance on the road forward. For example, agricultural technician Ying Xiandong only studied for one year. In the process of conducting scientific experiments, he has diligently studied more than 40 kinds of political theory and agricultural science books such as "On Practice," "Botany," and "Cultivation" over the past few years; he visited and consulted seed expert Yang Kuangbao more than 120 times; under the conditions of very cold weather and no greenhouse or germination equipment, in order to do germination experiments on improved varieties, he wrapped the wet seeds in cotton and cloth and tied them to his chest day and night. Later, he built his own soil-heated bed, slept next to the soil-heated bed, and guarded it day and night, diligently cultivating... After experiencing many failures and enduring many sleepless nights, he finally cultivated new varieties of crops such as rice, wheat, vegetables, melons, and fruits.

Another common feature of this group of new agricultural scientific and technical personnel engaged in scientific research and experimentation is that scientific research and experimentation are closely integrated with actual production and closely linked with the masses. Their many creations and inventions were researched and carried out together with the masses. Agricultural technician Yang Kuangbao has successively tested more than 180 rice varieties in the past eight years, and successfully selected and bred new varieties such as "Wuzui Nuo" and "Da Wuzui Nuo"; however, the acquisition of each of his crop varieties is due to close contact with the masses and reliance on the collective wisdom of the masses, and he has also trained more than 40 commune members to become experts in seed selection and breeding.

The greatest feature of this group of farmers who were hired as special researchers is that in order to complete the tasks assigned by the Party, they are determined to become stronger, know the difficulties and advance, so they can overcome the difficulties on the road forward and make great achievements in scientific research. For example, Zhang Yankao, the leader of the Youth Agricultural Science Research Group of Huxi Commune in Dongyang County and a Communist Party member, began to attack the scientific barriers of seeds at the age of sixteen. In the past few years, although he encountered many difficulties due to his low cultural level and lack of scientific knowledge, under the care and support of the Party, he was unyielding, worked, researched, and improved himself, and finally successfully cultivated various excellent varieties of rice, wheat, corn, cotton, and rapeseed. In 1958, the "Yuejin No." hybrid obtained by grafting the local corn improved variety "Yemaoku" and "Kelilao," was further cultivated in 1959, and the grains were as large as small silkworms, with a grain weight of 760 grains per catty, which is about twice as much as the 1,400 to 1,700 grains per catty of the parent, and the maturity period is 30 days earlier than "Yemaoku," which is suitable for three-crop autumn corn cultivation.

### 听党的话　结合生产　刻苦钻研　浙江31位农民荣任农技师工程师  196位农民被浙江省农业科学院聘为特约研究员

    听党的话　结合生产　刻苦钻研
　　浙江31位农民荣任农技师工程师
    196位农民被浙江省农业科学院聘为特约研究员
    据浙江日报消息：浙江省有许多农民和农民出身的干部听党的话，在生产中刻苦钻研，努力攀登科学高峰。最近他们之中有三十一位光荣地分别担任了农业技师、水产技师、农业机械工程师和水利工程师；有一百九十六位被浙江省农业科学院聘为特约研究员。这是人民的一件大喜事。
    劳动人民在旧社会里饱受统治阶级的压迫和剥削，失去了受教育的权利，才能和智慧被埋没，只有在社会主义制度下，才有机会从事科学研究。农业技师张友法，解放前也曾有过消灭柑桔大小年的理想，但是他没有条件进行试验。解放后，国家拨给他试验桔园，派技术员帮助他，在党和国家无微不至的关怀下，他终于实现了多年以来的理想。农业技师闻杏仁有二十八年不烂秧的宝贵经验，但是这些经验只是在解放以后才真正得到重视和推广。正如闻杏仁自己所说：
  “二十八年不烂秧，实际上只有解放以后才是真功夫，如果没有党的领导和帮助，单靠过去的老经验，要想像现在一样大面积种双季稻保证不烂秧，那是不可能的。”
    听党的话，在完成党交给的每一件任务中苦钻苦学，表现出高度的热情和责任心，是这些新型农业科学人才的共同具有的高贵品质。农业技师祝瑞香，把养猪看作是建设社会主义的光荣事业。她爱猪如宝，刻苦探求肉猪多长膘和母猪多产仔的规律。在党的帮助下，她创造了肉猪日长一斤肉和母猪多产的经验。根治红铃虫是增产棉花的关键性措施之一，农业技师周锡林为了响应党的号召，积极增产工业原料，就天天到棉田里去观察红铃虫的生活习性，废寝忘食地进行研究，终于创造了消灭红铃虫的新办法。
    这些人由一个普通农民而成为农业科学工作者，在前进的道路上，以顽强的毅力刻苦钻研，攻克了种种难关。例如农业技师应贤东只读过一年书，在进行科学试验的过程中，几年来他孜孜不倦地学习了“实践论”、“植物学”、“栽培学”等四十多种政治理论和农业科学书籍；到种子专家杨匡保那里参观请教达一百二十多次；在天气很冷、既无温室又无催芽设备的条件下，他为了做良种的催芽试验，把湿漉漉的种子包上棉花和布，缚在胸前日夜不放。以后他自造土温床，自己睡在土温床旁，日夜守候，辛勤培育……先后经历了多次的失败，熬过了多少个不眠之夜，终于培育出水稻、麦类、蔬菜、瓜果等农作物的新品种。
    这一批新型的农业科学技术人员从事科学研究试验的另一个共同特点是，科学研究试验密切结合生产实际，密切联系群众。他们的许多创造发明都是和群众一起研究进行的。农业技师杨匡保八年来先后试验水稻品种一百八十多个，选育成功“乌嘴糯”、“大乌嘴糯”等新品种；然而，他的每一个作物品种的获得，都是由于密切联系群众、依靠群众的集体智慧取得的，同时还培养了四十多个社员成为选种与繁育良种工作的能手。
    被聘为特约研究员的这批农民的最大特色是：为完成党所交给的任务，发愤图强，知难而进，所以能够克服前进道路上的困难，在科学研究方面作出了巨大成绩。如东阳县湖溪公社青年农业科学研究组组长、共产党员张彦考，十六岁时就开始猛攻种子科学关，几年来，虽然由于文化水平低和科学知识不足，碰到许多困难，但是在党的关怀与支持下，他不屈不挠，边劳动、边研究、边提高，终于培育成功水稻、麦类、玉米、棉花、油菜等多种优良品种。1958年他用当地玉米良种“野猫哭”与“壳里老”胚接获得的“跃进号”杂交种，经过1959年进一步培育，籽粒大似小蚕豆，粒重每斤七百六十粒，较父母本每斤一千四百至一千七百粒提高一倍左右，而且成熟期比“野猫哭”提早三十天，适合三熟制秋玉米栽培。（附图片）
