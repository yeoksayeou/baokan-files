Taiping Management District of Jingyang Commune, Sanyuan County, Shaanxi, strengthens fertilizer management to ensure that fertilizer nutrients are not lost, and every load of fertilizer is highly effective, applying sufficient high-quality fertilizer to wheat fields. During the process of mass accumulation and manufacturing of fertilizers, there was a phenomenon of neglecting fertilizer storage here. After seeing this situation, the comrades of the general party branch of the management district repeatedly explained to the members: if the fertilizer is not stored well, the fertilizer effect will be reduced, and two loads will not be as good as one. On the contrary, good fertilizer storage can greatly improve the quality. After the members improved their understanding through education, the production teams held forums for experienced farmers to exchange experience in fertilizer storage. The main experiences are: (1) After the manure is collected from the livestock pen, the fertilizer is piled up in a certain place into a cuboid five feet thick and ten feet wide, covered with fine loess on the top and around, and compacted on the outside. The top of the manure pile should be high on all four sides and low in the center to facilitate water accumulation during rain and promote fermentation. (2) Easily失效(lose efficacy) quick-acting fertilizers such as kang (heated brick bed) soil and old wall soil collected are generally piled in windy, high places, piled in a cone shape, and sealed with a layer of mud on the outside. (3) Each member household digs a manure pit in the corner of the wall in a shady place and puts household fertilizer in the沤(soak, macerate) fertilizer pit, which can both preserve the fertilizer effect and benefit hygiene. (4) The production team sets up a special ash storehouse to collect plant ash to avoid failure from mixing with human and animal manure.
    Now, these methods have been widely promoted throughout the management district, and a fertilizer storage system has been formulated.

    管好肥料　保住肥效
    陕西三原县泾阳公社太平管区加强肥料管理，确保肥料养分不流失，车车肥效高，给麦田施足优质肥。这里在大积大造肥料过程中，有忽视肥料保管的现象。管区党总支的同志看到这种情况后，反复向社员说明：如果保管不好肥料，肥效降低，两车顶不上一车。相反，肥料保管好，可以大大提高质量。通过教育，社员提高认识后，各生产队又举行了老农座谈会，交流了保管肥料的经验。这些经验主要是：（一）牲口圈起肥后，把肥在一定的地方堆成五尺厚、一丈宽的长方体，顶上和四周盖上细黄土末，外面拍实。粪堆上边要四边高中心低，以利下雨时积水，促进发酵。（二）对搜积下的炕土、陈墙土等容易失效的速效肥，一般都堆放在背风的高处，堆成锥形，外面封一层泥。（三）社员每户在墙角背阴处，挖一粪坑，把家肥放在沤肥坑，这样既可保住肥效，又有利卫生。（四）生产队设专用灰库，收藏草木灰，避免和人畜肥混合失效。
    现在，全管区普遍推广了这些办法，并且订出了保管肥料制度。
