The resolutions of the Third National Congress of the Labor Party become a huge source of encouragement.
The upsurge of cooperativization and production in Northern Vietnamese rural areas.
Eight provinces have basically completed cooperativization, and in the remaining seven provinces, cooperative households account for more than 70% of the total number of households.
Representatives from various provinces are determined at the winter-spring production conference to work hard to improve production and strive for a greater harvest than in previous years.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: After extensive socialist education of farmers, a magnificent upsurge of cooperativization is currently sweeping across the rural areas of North Vietnam.

According to incomplete statistics, from September 1st to 20th alone, 350,000 farm households voluntarily joined agricultural cooperatives, which is an average of 15,000 farm households joining cooperatives every day, thereby rapidly expanding the socialist阵地 in rural areas.

In Ninh Binh province, the number of farm households joining cooperatives jumped from 51.6% of the total number of farm households to 81.7% in twenty days. In My Ha commune, Nam Dinh province, under the slogan of "Going down on turtle's back, crossing fast horses," the proportion of households joining cooperatives jumped from 14% to 78% in ten days. Of the 292 villages in Thai Binh province, 162 villages have basically completed the initial agricultural cooperativization. In Ha Nam province, the number of households joining cooperatives in 26 villages accounts for 90% to 100% of the total number of households.

So far, in addition to the Vinh Linh area, which had already completed cooperativization, eight provinces including Ha Dong, Son Tay, and Hung Yen have basically completed cooperativization; the number of farm households joining cooperatives accounts for 75% to 88% of the total number of farm households in their respective provinces. In addition, in seven other provinces, the number of farm households joining cooperatives has also reached 70% to 73% of the number of farm households in their respective provinces.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 25th: The North Vietnam 1960-1961 Winter-Spring Production Conference, held from the 21st to the 24th, issued a resounding call, requiring all localities to extensively mobilize the masses of farmers on the basis of basically completing agricultural cooperativization this autumn and winter, and strive for a comprehensive and great victory in production this winter and spring.

Pham Hung, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party and Deputy Prime Minister, and the heads of relevant departments made reports at the meeting.

Pham Hung pointed out that this winter-spring agricultural production is the first in the initial stage of socialist industrialization, and the first production carried out in accordance with the spirit of the historic resolutions of the recently concluded Labor Party Congress.

He pointed out that if this agricultural production achieves a huge and comprehensive harvest, it will vividly reflect the fighting and practical significance of the resolutions of the Party Congress, and will more powerfully convince and encourage millions of people to turn the resolutions of the Party Congress into a material force for promoting production and developing cooperativization at a high speed. He said that we must concentrate our efforts to do a good job in this winter-spring production, ensure the continuous expanded reproduction of agriculture, and make it the basis for promoting the faster and more stable development of the entire national economy.

Pham Hung emphasized that it is necessary to focus on grain production, while paying attention to the development of cash crops and forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry, and vigorously establish and develop a diversified socialist tropical agriculture.

Representatives from various provinces launched heated challenges and responses at the meeting. They expressed their determination to strive for greater yields this winter and spring than in previous years, set off the first five-year plan (1961-1965) of agricultural production upsurge, and transform the resolutions of the Party Congress into an unlimited force for promoting the comprehensive victory of production.

    据新华社河内讯　经过对农民的广泛的社会主义教育，越南北方农村目前正在掀起一个波澜壮阔的合作化运动高潮。
    据不完全统计，仅从9月1日到20日就有三十五万农户自愿加入了农业合作社，即平均每天有一万五千农户加入合作社，从而迅速地扩大了社会主义在农村的阵地。
    宁平省在二十天内入社农户就从原来占农户总数的51.6％跃增到81.7％。南定省美河乡在“下龟背、跨快马”的口号下，在十天内入社农户的比例数就从14％跳到了78％。在太平省的二百九十二个乡中，已有一百六十二个乡基本完成初级农业合作化。河南省有二十六个乡入社农户已占农户总数的90％到100％。
    到目前为止，除了永灵区在此以前已经完成了合作化之外，河东、山西、兴安等八个省已经基本完成了合作化；入社农户分别占本省农户总数的75％到88％。另外还有七个省入社农户也分别达到本省农户数的70％到73％。
    新华社河内25日电　在21日到24日召开的越南全北方1960—1961年冬春生产会，发出了响亮的号召，要求各地在今年秋冬基本上完成农业合作化的基础上，广泛发动农民群众，争取今冬明春生产的全面、巨大的胜利。
    越南劳动党中央政治局委员、副总理范雄和有关部门的负责人在会上作了报告。
    范雄指出，今冬明春的农业生产是社会主义工业化开端时期的头一次，是按照刚结束的劳动党代表大会的历史性决议的精神制订的农业生产计划进行的第一次生产。
    他指出，这次农业生产如果取得巨大和全面的丰收，将生动地体现党代表大会决议的战斗性和实践意义，将更加有力地说服和鼓舞成百万群众把党代表大会的决议变为推动生产、高速度发展合作化的物质力量。他说，我们必须集中力量搞好今冬明春的生产，保证农业不断地扩大再生产，使之成为促进整个国民经济更快、更稳地发展的基础。
    范雄强调必须以粮食生产为中心，同时注意发展经济作物和林、渔、畜牧业，大力建立和发展一个多种的社会主义热带农业。
    各省代表在会上展开了热烈的挑战和应战。他们纷纷表示决心，要在今冬明春争取比往年更大的丰产，掀起第一个五年计划（1961—1965年）的农业生产高潮，把党代表大会的决议化为推动生产全面胜利的无限力量。（附图片）
