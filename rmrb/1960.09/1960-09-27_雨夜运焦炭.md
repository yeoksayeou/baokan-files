A Heart for Steelmaking

　　Transporting Coke in the Rainy Night
　　At 5:00 PM, the Yangxin County Transportation Company's Pailong Sailing Boat Brigade received a call from the county steel mill: "The small blast furnace needs coke to increase production and hopes it can be delivered before 10:00 AM tomorrow."
　　At that time, it was raining heavily with strong winds. Stationmaster Hu Weigao told the boatmen the news. Kong Xiangyong, Hong Keyi, and a young girl from boat number 53 rushed out of the cabin and exclaimed, "Stationmaster Hu, assign this task to us!" Old Hu looked at the three young people and nodded, saying, "The task is urgent, the wind is strong, and the rain is heavy, so be extra careful when sailing! Hey! Haven't you had dinner yet?" The young girl smiled and said, "It's okay if the small blast furnace gets enough to eat; we can eat later." As she spoke, the two young men had already started rowing the boat out of the harbor.
　　When the boat reached Zhoujia Ferry, the sky was already as black as the bottom of a pot. The three young people loaded five tons of coke onto the boat in one go. The sailboat flew like a small arrow through the stormy waves, and the raging wind and rain could not stop them.
　　The next morning, the wind and rain stopped, and a red sun appeared in the east. At 9:00 AM, the boat approached the steel mill's riverbank.
　　In order to commend their heroic behavior of fighting against wind and rain, the Yangxin County Industrial Bureau awarded them a red flag with the words "Making Meritorious Contributions to Support Steel." (E) (Attached picture)
　　The high-yield model team of Sichuan Province Automobile Transportation—the train team of Xie Xuanqing group of Leshan Transportation Company traverses mountains and rivers day and night, transporting coke to Dongshan Steel Plant.

### 雨夜运焦炭

　　雨夜运焦炭
    下午五点，湖北阳新县运输公司排龙帆船大队，接到县钢铁厂一个电话：“小高炉增产需要焦炭，希望在明天上午十点以前送到。”
    当时正是风雨大作。站长胡维高把这个消息告诉了船民。五十三号船的孔祥勇、洪科裔和一个小姑娘，一齐冲出船舱，大声说：“胡站长，这任务交给我们去完成！”老胡看着三个青年点了点头说：“任务紧，风大雨急，船行要多加注意啊！喂！你们还没吃晚饭吧？”小姑娘笑着说：“让小高炉吃饱肚子就行，我们晚吃一会不要紧。”说话时，两个小伙子已经摇橹把船开出港口了。
    船到骤家渡口，天已经像锅底一样黑了，三个青年人一口气就把五吨焦装上了船。帆船像一枝小箭在惊涛骇浪中往县钢铁厂飞驶，狂风暴雨一点阻挡不了他们。
    第二天早晨，风雨停息，东方现出一轮红日，九点钟船靠近钢铁厂的河岸。
    阳新县工业局为了表扬他们这种与风雨搏斗的英勇行为，授予他们一面“支援钢铁立功”的红旗。　（鄂）（附图片）
    四川省汽车运输高产标兵组——乐山运输公司谢选清小组的列车队翻山越岭，日夜兼程，把焦炭运到东山钢铁厂去。
