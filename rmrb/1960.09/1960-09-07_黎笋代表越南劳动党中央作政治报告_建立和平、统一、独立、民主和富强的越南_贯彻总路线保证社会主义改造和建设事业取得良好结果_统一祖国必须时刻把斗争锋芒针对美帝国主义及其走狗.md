Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 5th. Le Duan, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, today delivered a lengthy political report to the Third Party Congress on behalf of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party.

In his report, Le Duan first summarized the process of Vietnam's revolutionary victory and development since the Second National Congress of the Vietnamese Labor Party.

Le Duan said: "Our Party's Second National Congress was a congress for resisting the war and saving the country, while our Party's current National Congress is a congress for building socialism in the North and striving to achieve national reunification. The congress will pave the way for our people to embark on a new victory."

Le Duan's report is divided into seven parts.

Speaking of the current situation and the Party's current tasks, Le Duan said: "At present, due to the occupation of the South by US imperialism, our country is temporarily divided into two regions. The North has completed the task of the national democratic revolution and has entered the transitional period of socialism. The South is still suffering under the rule of imperialism and feudal forces. This situation has created two regions in our country with different political and social systems. Therefore, the Vietnamese revolution at this stage has two tasks belonging to two different strategies. To ensure the complete victory of our people's revolutionary struggle, we must recognize the essence of the revolutionary tasks in each region, and at the same time, in the process of revolutionary development, we must tightly grasp the relationship between the two revolutionary tasks in the two regions."

He said: "The North, after completing the two basic tasks of the national democratic revolution, obviously cannot stop there, but must continue to move forward. The direction of the North's revolution can only be socialism and not capitalism."

He pointed out: "Only by making the North move forward along the socialist road can we consolidate and develop the victories that have been achieved, strengthen and empower the North in all aspects, and create favorable conditions for the realization of national reunification. Therefore, building socialism in the North and rapidly strengthening the strength of the North in all aspects is an inevitable task of the North's revolution and our entire nation's revolution."

He said: "When the North is carrying out the socialist revolution, it is also the time when the South must vigorously realize the broad national unity including all national democratic forces opposing the US-Ngo clique. In consolidating the work in the North, we must, on the one hand, firmly grasp the direction of building socialism, and on the other hand, pay special attention to the situation in the South, provide conditions for uniting all patriotic forces opposing the US-Ngo regime in the South, forming a broad national united front based on the worker-peasant alliance, and ensuring the victory of the revolutionary struggle in the South. Our policy of carrying out the socialist revolution in the North is: build the North and take care of the South."

Le Duan said: "At present, the South is under the rule of imperialism and feudal forces. US imperialism and its lackeys have occupied the South and established a fascist dictatorship in the South, not only to undermine our people's cause of unifying the country, but also to oppress, exploit, persecute, and slaughter the people of the South, and prepare for a war of aggression. In order to protect their lives and immediate interests, the people of the South have no other way but to overthrow the US-Ngo fascist dictatorship, completely liberate the South, realize national reunification, and contribute to building a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam."

He said: "To carry out the revolution to liberate the South is to resolve the two basic contradictions existing in the South's society: one is the contradiction between the people of the South and the imperialist aggressors, mainly US imperialism and its lackeys; the other is the contradiction between the people of the South, especially the peasants, and the feudal landlord class. Only after resolving these two contradictions can the people of the South get rid of their current poverty and humiliation, and at the same time, the South's society can develop smoothly and then merge with the North's society into a unified whole."

He said: "The socialist revolution in the North and the national democratic revolution in the South belong to two different revolutionary strategies. However, because they currently have a common goal of realizing the reunification of the motherland, they have close relationships, influence each other, promote each other, and develop together. We must recognize that the task of the socialist revolution in the North is the most decisive task for the development of our entire revolutionary cause and the cause of unifying the country. At the same time, we must recognize the direct decisive role of the Southern revolution in liberating the South and realizing the peaceful reunification of the motherland. In this way, we can have a comprehensive understanding of the content and tasks of our country's revolution at this stage, and have correct propositions, guidelines, plans, and methods in order to victoriously build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam.

"Our people's revolutionary task at this stage is: strengthen national unity, resolutely fight to maintain peace, vigorously promote the socialist revolution in the North, and at the same time vigorously promote the national democratic revolution in the South, realize national reunification on the basis of independence and democracy, establish a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam, and make a practical contribution to strengthening the socialist camp and defending Southeast Asia and world peace.

"Our Party bears an extremely important responsibility for realizing the above-mentioned revolutionary tasks. Absolutely loyal to the interests of the class and the nation, our Party will continue to work hard, unite, organize, and lead our people to fight without hesitation, overcome all difficulties, and fulfill this glorious revolutionary task perfectly."

In the second part of his report, Le Duan spoke about the struggle to realize national reunification and complete the national democratic revolution throughout the country.

After detailing the blatant aggression of the United States against South Vietnam, as well as the various crimes of the US-Ngo clique in South Vietnam and the heroic struggle of the South Vietnamese people over the past six years, Comrade Le Duan pointed out: "The basic task of the Southern revolution is to liberate the South from the shackles of imperialism and feudal forces, realize national independence and land to the tiller, and contribute to building a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam.

"The current task of the Southern revolution is: unite the whole people, resolutely oppose the aggressive and provocative US imperialism, oppose the dictatorial ruling clique of Ngo Dinh Diem, the lackey of US imperialism, establish a national democratic united regime in the South, realize national independence and various democratic freedoms, and then realize national reunification, and make active contributions to defending Southeast Asia and world peace."

He pointed out: "In order to ensure the complete victory of the revolutionary struggle in the South, under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist party of the working class, the people of the South must work harder to establish the unity of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and realize a broad national united front against the US-Ngo clique."

Le Duan said, "The struggle to realize the reunification of the motherland is a sharp, long-term, arduous, and complex revolutionary struggle process against US imperialism and its lackeys in the South. In this struggle, we must rely closely on the great unity of the national people, and must always aim the spearhead of the struggle at the most dangerous and most ferocious enemy of our people today - US imperialism and its lackeys. Our people's struggle to realize a unified country is just. US imperialism is the mortal enemy of our people and the mortal enemy of peace-loving people all over the world. Therefore, the vast people of the world are increasingly supporting us, our people's strength is growing, and the enemy's power is declining." He said: "In the process of our people's struggle, the form of gradually unifying the country may appear." He said: "Our people and government have worked hard and will work harder to create conditions and favorable opportunities for unifying the country through peaceful means. However, if US imperialism and its lackeys in the South dare to launch a war of aggression, violating the wishes and interests of our people and the people of the world, then our entire nation, with the hearts of the North and the South united, will stand up and defeat them with the sympathy and support of the people of the world."

Le Duan then discussed the general line of the socialist revolution in North Vietnam in the third part of the report.

After analyzing the current socio-historical characteristics of North Vietnam and clarifying the guidelines and policies in socialist transformation and socialist construction, Le Duan said: "The socialist transition period in North Vietnam is a socialist revolution carried out by our Party in the political, economic, ideological, cultural, and technological fields, including socialist transformation and socialist construction. This period lasts from the complete liberation of the North until the basic completion of socialism."

He said: The general line of the socialist transition period in North Vietnam is: "Unite the people of the whole country, carry forward our people's high patriotic spirit, tradition of courageous struggle and hard work, and at the same time strengthen unity with various socialist brotherly countries headed by the Soviet Union, so that the North can advance towards socialism quickly, vigorously, and steadily."

"To achieve this goal, we must use the people's democratic regime to carry out the historical task of the dictatorship of the proletariat, carry out socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, small merchants, and private capitalist industry and commerce, develop the state-owned economic component, and realize socialist industrialization by reasonably prioritizing the development of heavy industry while developing agriculture and light industry; vigorously promote ideological, cultural, and technological socialist revolutions in order to build our country into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and advanced culture and science, build a new life in the North, and consolidate the North as a solid base in the struggle to realize the peaceful reunification of the country, and contribute to strengthening the socialist camp and maintaining peace in Southeast Asia and the world."

"In formulating the first five-year plan (1961 to 1965), or future long-term economic plans, we must grasp this general line to ensure that the socialist transformation and socialist construction in the North achieve good results."

In the fourth part of the report, Le Duan talked about the tasks and directions of Vietnam's first five-year plan (1961-1965).

He said: "In order to vigorously develop productive forces, consolidate and develop new relations of production, and enable the North of our country to advance towards socialism quickly, vigorously, and steadily, in the first five-year plan, we must strive to further realize socialist industrialization, initially lay the material and technical foundation of socialism, and at the same time complete socialist transformation, so that our country's economy becomes a socialist economy." He said: "In order to achieve this goal, the basic tasks of the first five-year plan are:

"(1) Vigorously develop industry and agriculture, initially realize the priority development of heavy industry, while vigorously and comprehensively developing agriculture, strive to develop light industry and the food industry, develop the transportation industry, strengthen the state-owned commercial and cooperative commercial forces, and prepare for building our country into a socialist industrial and agricultural country.

"(2) Complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, small merchants, and private capitalist industry and commerce, consolidate and strengthen the state-owned economic component, strengthen the relationship between ownership by the whole people and collective ownership, and expand the socialist relations of production throughout the national economy.

"(3) Improve the people's cultural level and socialist awareness, vigorously promote the work of training cadres for economic construction and skilled workers, improve the ability of cadres, workers, and working people to manage the economy; promote scientific and technological work, promote the exploration of natural resources and conduct investigations for infrastructure construction in order to serve the needs of developing socialist economy and culture.

"(4) Further improve the material and cultural life of the working people, ensure that our people have enough to eat, wear, live, and have access to education, develop public welfare undertakings, and build a new life in rural and urban areas.

"(5) While developing the economy, we must combine it with strengthening national defense, strengthening social order and national security, and ensuring the socialist construction of the North."

He said: "These five tasks are closely related to each other. They are all to ensure the establishment of the initial material and technical basis of socialism in the North, strengthen the strength of the North in all aspects, and make the North an increasingly solid base for the people of the whole country in the struggle for national reunification."

He pointed out: "According to preliminary calculations, the Party Central Committee believes that it is necessary to submit the following main control figures to the Congress as the basis for formulating the first five-year plan.

"After five years, the total industrial output value is expected to increase by 148% compared to 1960, of which the first category will increase by 215% and the second category will increase by 110%. Industry will grow at an average annual rate of 20%, with the first category alone growing at 25.8% and the second category growing at 16%.

"Within five years, the total agricultural output value will increase by 61% compared to 1960, with an average annual increase of 10%.

"By 1965, it is estimated that industry will account for 51% of the total output value of industry and agriculture, and agriculture will account for 49%.

"As for labor productivity, it is expected to increase by 54% in state-owned industries, with an average annual increase of 9%.

"Within five years, 125,000 senior and middle-level technical cadres must be trained (i.e. ten times the three-year plan) in order to be assigned to work in various departments.

"In terms of improving people's lives, we will strive to increase the real income of workers and peasants by about 30% by 1965 compared to 1960."

He said: "In the future, we must also work hard to complete socialist transformation. This is one of the important revolutionary tasks of the first five-year plan."

Le Duan said: "In order to adapt to the new requirements of the agricultural collectivization movement, our Party must formulate some new policies: transfer primary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, merge small cooperatives into large cooperatives, correctly handle the interests of cooperative members and small cooperatives in development, the distribution of cooperative members' income under the conditions of diversified operations, the use of cooperative accumulation funds, etc., and at the same time, specifically study the organizational structure and activities of party, government, and mass grassroots organizations in order to conform to the development of the agricultural collectivization movement."

He said: "We must vigorously establish and develop the foundation of heavy industry. The main directions for the construction and development of heavy industry in our country in the next five years are: promote the leading development of the electric power industry, focus on the development of the iron and steel industry and the machine manufacturing industry, and at the same time develop the building materials industry and initially establish the chemical industry."

He also pointed out: "With the construction of the foundation of heavy industry, we must strive to develop light industry." At the same time, "local industry must be developed in a planned and led manner."

Le Duan said: "Comprehensive, vigorous, and steady development of agriculture is the foundation for the development of industry in the North. The more industry develops, the more it needs the development of agriculture."

He said: "Agriculture plays a very important role in the national economy. During the first five-year plan, although we attach more importance to the development of industry than in the past, this does not mean that we neglect agriculture. On the contrary, it is precisely because we attach more importance to the development of industry that we attach more importance to agriculture."

In the fifth part, Le Duan talked about strengthening the people's democratic regime and consolidating the political and spiritual unity of the people in the North. He emphasized: "The people's democratic regime must resolutely implement the dictatorship in order to complete its historical mission. In order to implement the dictatorship, our regime not only uses revolutionary laws but also adopts ideological and political struggles to defeat hostile forces. On the one hand, we must pay attention to strengthening national defense, strengthening the armed and semi-armed forces of the people, and improving the people's public security organs, people's procuratorates, and people's courts, which are sharp weapons for strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship; on the other hand, we must mobilize and organize the masses of the people to carry out political struggles in order to suppress counter-revolutionaries. At the same time, we must carry out ideological struggles against backward elements in order to educate them."

He said: "When our country is still divided, US imperialism and its lackeys have turned the South of our country into a US colony and military base, and are stepping up their arms expansion and preparing for a war of aggression. The people's democratic regime should always attach importance to strengthening national defense forces, and the people's army is the core of this force."

He pointed out: "In order for the people's democratic regime to complete its tasks, it is necessary to consolidate and strengthen state institutions"; "It is necessary to strengthen the role of state organs at all levels and correctly implement democratic centralism in the life of state organs"; "The people's democratic regime must pay special attention to strengthening ties with the masses of the people and strive to overcome bureaucracy."

He emphasized: "The people's democratic regime can only be stable and strong when it is close to the people, supervised by the people, and led by the party of the working class. Only under the leadership of the Party can the state carry out the historical task of the dictatorship of the proletariat."

Subsequently, in the sixth part, Le Duan spoke about strengthening international solidarity and actively striving to defend and consolidate world peace.

He said: "We are living in a great era unprecedented in human history. This is an era in which the transition from capitalism to socialism is the basic content; an era in which socialism has become a world system and has gained obvious advantages on the international stage; an era in which the forces of socialism, national independence, democracy, and peace exceed the forces of imperialism; an era in which the revolutionary movement is developing incomparably powerfully and imperialism is moving towards the path of irreparable demise."

He said: "Today, the world socialist system headed by the Soviet Union has become a unified and powerful whole, including twelve countries and one billion people, accounting for more than one-third of the world's total population and one-quarter of the world's total area. The strength of the socialist camp in many aspects has exceeded the strength of imperialism and has become the decisive factor in the development of the current world situation. Socialism is increasingly showing its advantages and has an increasingly powerful attraction to the working people all over the world."

Le Duan pointed out: "The increasingly powerful development of the political, economic, scientific, and technological forces of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp is an undeniable sign that socialism has an absolute advantage over capitalism. The working people and oppressed nations all over the world increasingly realize that the socialist camp is the source they place their greatest hopes on, and the most glorious model that inspires them on the road to fighting for human freedom, independence, and happiness."

He pointed out: "The strength of the socialist camp and the rapid awakening of various oppressed nations have powerfully promoted the world national liberation movement. In recent years, this movement has erupted and flourished in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and has successively achieved victories."

Le Duan said: "The powerful development of socialism, national independence, and the world's democratic and peaceful forces has greatly accelerated the inevitable collapse of imperialism. The general crisis of capitalism is deepening."

He said: "The above situation has proved that the balance of power in the world today has undergone fundamental changes: socialism, national independence, and the world's democratic and peaceful forces have overwhelmed the forces of world bellicose imperialism and are gradually pushing this force towards isolation. This situation has created a real possibility of preventing a new world war, and at the same time, this possibility is increasing."

He went on to say: "However, we cannot forget that imperialism is the root of war. As long as imperialism exists, mankind will be threatened by war. The warmongers, especially the warmongers of US imperialism, are still stubbornly continuing their policy of aggression and war. They are still continuing to step up their arms expansion, engage in an arms race, strengthen West German militarism, step up the revival of Japanese militarist forces, and try every possible means to maintain the 'Cold War'. The events of the US U-2 type aircraft and the recent RB-47 type aircraft invading Soviet airspace for military reconnaissance clearly revealed the true face of the warmongering of US imperialism. In the future, they will use all means to undermine world peace. Therefore, peace-loving people all over the world must constantly be vigilant and make greater efforts to maintain and consolidate peace."

He said: "US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of peace-loving people in the world. Recently, the warmongers of US imperialism and their lackeys have exposed their extremely reactionary and warmongering nature in their frenzied activities to undermine the cause of peace. The most important task of the people of the world is to carry out active struggles to maintain and consolidate peace, and oppose the provocative conspiracies of imperialism headed by US imperialism. The declaration of the meeting of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various socialist countries held in Moscow in November 1957 has clearly pointed out: 'Now, striving for peace and peaceful coexistence has become the demand of the broadest masses of people in all countries of the world. The Communist Parties of all countries believe that the struggle for peace is their primary task. They will work together with all peace-loving forces to do everything possible to prevent war.'"

Le Duan said: "The essence of socialism is peace. Socialist countries need peace in order to concentrate their efforts on economic and cultural construction and improve the living standards of the working people. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is the mainstay of the great cause of defending and consolidating world peace."

He said: "The more united and consistent the socialist camp and the international communist movement are, the more vigorous the world revolutionary movement will be, and the more the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism will be raised before progressive mankind. It is precisely because of this that the imperialists and their lackeys have used every means to undermine the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement. In these activities, the Yugoslav revisionists played an extremely despicable role. However, the Communist and Workers' Parties of the world have resolutely criticized revisionism and exposed the true face of the Yugoslav revisionists' betrayal of Marxism-Leninism, causing their divisive conspiracies to suffer a shameful defeat."

Le Duan pointed out: The basic content of the foreign policy of the Vietnamese Party and government is:

"(1) Continue to strengthen the unity of our country with the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union. Consolidate the unbreakable friendship between our country and fraternal countries, develop the mutual assistance and cooperation relationship between our country and various fraternal countries in accordance with the principles of proletarian internationalism, and at the same time contribute to strengthening the unity of the international communist movement.

"(2) Resolutely continue to carry out joint struggles with various fraternal countries and peace-loving people all over the world to defend and consolidate peace, oppose the aggressive policies and war policies of US imperialism, realize peaceful coexistence between countries with different political and social systems, realize disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons, abolish military bases and military aggression groups in other countries, and then establish a collective security system in Europe and Asia.

"We warmly welcome and fully support the Soviet government's initiative on comprehensive and thorough disarmament, and the recent Soviet government's proposal on abolishing atomic weapons and nuclear weapon delivery vehicles.

"We also warmly welcome and fully support the Chinese government's proposal that Asian countries and Pacific region countries (including the United States) jointly sign a treaty of non-aggression and peace, and turn the entire Asia and Pacific region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone.

"(3) Actively support the struggle movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonialism and for national independence. Strengthen friendly relations with various nationalist countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference, and develop economic and cultural cooperative relations with them.

"For various neighboring countries, we hope to establish and develop good relations on the basis of mutual respect for independence, sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs. We welcome the current peaceful and neutral policy of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and further strengthen friendly relations with the Kingdom of Cambodia. We support the Lao people's struggle to realize a peaceful and neutral policy and national harmony, and hope to establish permanent and firm friendly relations with the Kingdom of Laos. We are always ready to establish friendly relations with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

"(4) Resolutely struggle for the thorough implementation of the Geneva Agreement on the Indochina issue in order to maintain peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, and then realize the peaceful reunification of the Vietnamese state.

"(5) While establishing and strengthening friendly relations with governments of various countries, we should expand the friendly relations between the people of our country and the people of various countries."

In the last part, Le Duan talked about the issue of the Party.

He said: "The revolutionary experience of the past thirty years has proved that the leadership of our Party is the basic condition for our people to achieve all victories. Therefore, in order for our Party to be able to complete its tasks in the current stage of the revolution, the key issue is still to continuously strengthen the Party's leadership."

Le Duan said: "Our Party has a tradition of unity and consistency, which is our precious asset. We should strive to carry forward and enhance this precious tradition. The unity and consistency of our Party is principled. The foundation of this unity and consistency is a high degree of ideological unity and a consolidated organizational unity. In order to strengthen unity and consistency within the Party, we must care about and strengthen the Party's ideological unity and organizational unity."

He said, "The issue of ideological unity can only be firmly established on the basis of the Marxist-Leninist ideology and standpoint of the working class."

He said: "In short, in the current stage of the revolution, the ideological work within our Party is to improve proletarian ideology, oppose bourgeois ideology, oppose petty-bourgeois ideology, and continue to eliminate all remnants of feudalism and other non-proletarian ideologies on the basis of systematically carrying out Marxist-Leninist education. This is the long-term direction of ideological work within our Party. When carrying out ideological work in each period, we must also define specific content for this direction based on the current political tasks and the ideological situation of cadres and party members, as well as the revolutionary requirements of specific periods."

He said: "While carrying out ideological education and ideological struggle, we must struggle against wrong political tendencies and expressions of dogmatism, and pay special attention to preventing revisionism, and regard it as the main danger in the current revolutionary movement. Resolutely safeguard the Party's political line and program, and defend and enhance the Party's leading role."

Le Duan finally said: "This National Congress of our Party is of great significance in the history of the revolution in our country. The revolutionary line put forward by the Congress is a bright beacon illuminating the path for our people to move towards socialism, unify the country, and build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam.

"Under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, under the banner of our Party headed by the beloved Comrade Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people are united as one and strive to turn this revolutionary line into reality and strive for a bright future."

    黎笋代表越南劳动党中央作政治报告
    建立和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南
    贯彻总路线保证社会主义改造和建设事业取得良好结果
    统一祖国必须时刻把斗争锋芒针对美帝国主义及其走狗
    新华社河内5日电　越南劳动党中央政治局委员黎笋今天代表越南劳动党中央委员会，向第三次党代表大会作了长篇的政治报告。
    黎笋在报告中首先概述了自越南劳动党第二次全国代表大会以来越南革命胜利发展的过程。
    黎笋说：“我们党的第二次全国代表大会是抗战救国的大会，而我们党这次的全国代表大会是在北方建设社会主义和争取实现国家统一的大会。大会将为我们全国人民走上新的胜利开辟道路。”
    黎笋的报告分为七个部分。
    在讲到目前形势和党的当前任务时，黎笋说：“目前，由于美帝国主义侵占南方，我国暂时被分割为两个地区。北方，已完成了民族民主革命任务，并已跨进了社会主义的过渡时期。南方，还遭受帝国主义和封建势力的统治。这种情况，使我国形成了具有不同政治和社会制度的两个地区。因此，在现阶段的越南革命具有属于两个不同战略的两个任务。为保证我国人民革命斗争取得完全胜利，我们必须认清在每个地区的革命任务的本质，同时，在革命发展的过程中，必须紧紧地掌握住两个地区的两个革命任务之间的关系。”
    他说：“北方，在完成了民族民主革命的两个基本任务之后，显然是不可能停留在那里，而是更要继续前进的。北方革命的前进方向，只可能是社会主义而不可能是资本主义。”
    他指出：“只有使北方沿着社会主义道路前进，才能巩固和发展已经取得的胜利，使北方各方面得到稳固和强大，为实现国家的统一创造有利条件。因此，在北方建设社会主义，迅速地加强北方各方面的力量，是北方革命和我们全国革命必然的任务。”
    他说：“北方进行社会主义革命的时候，也正是南方必须大力实现包括一切反对美吴集团的民族民主力量的广泛的民族团结的时候。在巩固北方的工作中，我们一方面必须坚定地掌握建设社会主义的方向，另一方面必须特别关注南方的情况，为在南方团结所有反对美吴制度的爱国力量、结成以工农联盟为基础的广泛的民族统一战线而提供条件，保证南方的革命斗争事业取得胜利。我们在北方进行社会主义革命的方针是：建设北方，照顾南方。”
    黎笋说：“目前南方正处于帝国主义和封建势力的统治下。美帝国主义及其走狗侵占了南方和在南方建立法西斯的独裁政权，不仅是为着破坏我国人民统一国家的事业，而且是为着压迫、剥削、迫害、屠杀南方人民，准备侵略战争。为着保卫自己的生命和切身的利益，南方人民除了走打倒美吴法西斯独裁制度，完全解放南方，实现国家的统一，并为建设一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南而作出贡献的道路之外，别无他途。”
    他说：“进行解放南方的革命，就是解决目前南方社会所存在的两个基本矛盾：一是南方人民同帝国主义侵略者，主要是美帝国主义及其走狗之间的矛盾；二是南方人民，首先是农民同封建地主阶级之间的矛盾。只有解决了这两个矛盾之后，南方人民才能摆脱目前贫困屈辱的生活，同时南方社会才能顺利发展，进而同北方社会融合成一个统一的整体。”
    他说：“在北方的社会主义革命和在南方的民族民主革命是属于两个不同的革命战略。但是，由于目前它们有着一个实现祖国统一的共同目标，因此，它们互有密切的关系，相互影响，相互推进，共同发展。我们必须认清北方的社会主义革命的任务是一个对于我国整个革命事业的发展和统一国家事业的最有决定性的任务。同时要认清南方革命在解放南方和实现祖国和平统一事业中的直接决定作用。这样，我们对现阶段的我国革命的内容与任务才有一个全面的认识，才有正确的主张、方针、计划和方法，以便胜利地建设一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南。
    “我国人民在现阶段的革命任务是：加强全民团结，为维护和平而坚决斗争，大力推进北方的社会主义革命，同时大力推动南方的民族民主革命，在独立和民主的基础上实现国家的统一，建立一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南，为加强社会主义阵营和保卫东南亚以及世界和平而作出切实的贡献。
    “对实现上述革命任务，我们党负有极其重大的责任。绝对忠诚于阶级和民族的利益，我们党将继续努力，团结、组织和领导我国人民不惜牺牲而奋斗，克服一切困难，美满地去完成这个光荣的革命任务。”
    黎笋在他报告的第二部分中讲到为实现国家的统一、在全国范围内完成民族民主革命而斗争的问题。
    在详细叙述了美国对越南南方的明目张胆的侵略以及美吴集团在越南南方的各种罪行和越南南方人民六年来英勇斗争的史实之后，黎笋同志指出：“南方革命的基本任务是，把南方从帝国主义和封建势力的枷锁下解放出来，实现民族独立和耕者有其田，为建设一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南作出贡献。
      “南方革命的当前任务是：团结全民，坚决反对侵略的和挑衅的美帝国主义，反对美帝国主义的走狗吴庭艳的独裁统治集团，在南方成立一个民族民主联合政权，实现民族独立和各种民主自由权，进而实现国家统一，为保卫东南亚和世界和平做出积极的贡献。”
    他指出：“为了保证南方革命斗争取得完全胜利，在工人阶级的马克思列宁主义政党的领导下，南方人民更要努力建立工农兵的联合，并实现反美吴集团的广泛的民族统一战线。”
    黎笋说，“实现祖国统一的斗争，是反对美帝国主义及其在南方的走狗的尖锐、长期、艰苦和复杂的革命斗争过程。在这场斗争中，我们必须紧靠着全国人民群众伟大的团结力量，必须时刻把斗争的锋芒针对着我国人民目前最危险、最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义及其走狗。我国人民为着实现统一国家而进行的斗争是正义的。美帝国主义是我国人民的死敌，也是全世界爱好和平人民的死敌。因此，世界广大人民日益支持我们，我国人民的力量日益发展，而敌人的势力日益衰颓。”他说：“在我国人民的斗争过程中，可能出现逐步统一国家的形式。”他说：“我国人民和政府已经努力和将更加努力，通过和平的道路，为统一国家创造条件和有利的时机。但是美帝国主义及其在南方的走狗，如果胆敢发动侵略战争，违反我国人民和世界人民的愿望和利益，则我们全国民族，南北一心，在世界人民的同情和支持下，将站起来击败它们。”
    黎笋接着在报告的第三部分论述了越南北方社会主义革命的总路线。
    在分析了越南北方当前的社会历史特点和阐明在社会主义改造和社会主义建设中的方针、政策后，黎笋说：“在我国北方的社会主义过渡时期，是我们党在政治、经济、思想、文化和技术各个领域中所进行的包括社会主义改造和社会主义建设的社会主义革命。这个时期从北方得到完全解放直到社会主义基本建成为止。”
    他说：北方社会主义过渡时期的总路线是：“团结全国人民，发扬我国人民高度的爱国精神、勇敢斗争和辛勤劳动的传统，同时加强同以苏联为首的各个社会主义兄弟国家的团结，使北方快、猛、稳地向社会主义迈进。”
      “为了达到这个目的，必须利用人民民主政权去执行无产阶级专政的历史任务，对农业、手工业、小商贩和私营资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造，发展国营经济成份，以合理地优先发展重工业同时发展农业和轻工业的方法去实现社会主义工业化；大力推动思想、文化和技术的社会主义革命，以便把我国建成一个拥有现代化工业、现代化农业以及先进的文化和科学的社会主义国家，建设北方的新生活和巩固北方成为实现和平统一国家斗争中的坚强基地，为加强社会主义阵营、为维护东南亚和世界和平作出贡献。”
      “在制订第一个五年计划中（1961年至1965年），或今后的各个长期性的经济计划，我们必须掌握这个总路线，保证北方的社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业取得良好的结果。”
    在报告的第四部分，黎笋谈到越南第一个五年计划（1961—1965）的任务和方向。
    他说：“为了大力地发展生产力，巩固和发展新的生产关系，使我国北方能够快、猛、稳地向社会主义迈进，在第一个五年计划中，我们必须努力奋斗，以便进一步实现社会主义工业化，初步打下社会主义的物质和技术基础，同时完成社会主义改造，从而使我国经济成为一个社会主义的经济。”他说：“为了实现这个目标，第一个五年计划的基本任务：
    “（一）努力发展工业和农业，初步实现优先发展重工业，同时大力而全面地发展农业，努力发展轻工业和食品工业，发展交通运输业，加强国营商业和合作社商业力量，为把我国建成一个社会主义的工业和农业国作好准备。
    “（二）完成对农业、手工业、小商贩和私营资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，巩固和加强国营经济成份，加强全民所有制和集体所有制之间的关系，并在整个国民经济中扩大社会主义的生产关系。
    “（三）提高人民的文化水平和社会主义觉悟程度，大力推进培养经济建设干部和熟练工人的工作，提高干部、工人和劳动人民管理经济能力；促进科学技术工作，促进对自然资源的勘探和进行基建的调查，以便为发展社会主义经济、文化的需要而服务。
      “（四）进一步改善劳动人民的物质和文化生活，保证我国人民吃得饱、穿得暖、有得住和受教育的机会，发展公共福利事业，建设农村和城市的新生活。
      “（五）在发展经济的同时，要结合加强国防力量，加强社会秩序和国家安全，保证北方的社会主义建设。”
    他说：“这五项任务是互相有着密切关系的。都是为着保证建立北方的社会主义的物质和技术的初步基础，加强北方各方面的力量，使北方成为全国人民在争取国家统一斗争中的日益稳固的基地。”
    他指出：“根据初步的计算，党中央认为有必要向大会提出下列的主要控制数字，以便作为制订第一个五年计划的根据。
      “在五年后，预计工业总产值将比1960年增长148％，其中第一部类增长215％，第二部类增长110％。工业每年平均将增长20％，单是第一部类就增长25.8％，第二部类增长16％。
    “在五年内，农业总产值将比1960年增长61％，每年平均将增长10％。
    “到1965年，在工农业的总产值中，预计工业将占51％，农业占49％。
    “至于劳动率方面，预计在国营工业中将增长54％，平均每年增长9％。
    “在五年内，必须培养出十二万五千名高、中级技术干部（即等于三年计划的十倍），以便分配到各个部门去工作。
    “在改善人民生活方面，我们将努力使工人和农民的实际收入到1965年比1960年增长30％左右。”
    他说：“今后我们还要努力完成社会主义的改造。这是第一个五年计划的重要革命任务之一。”
    黎笋说：“为了适应农业合作化运动的新要求，我们党必须制订一些新的政策：把初级合作社转上高级合作社，把小的合作社并成大的合作社，在发展中正确处理社员和各个小的合作社的利益，在实现多种经营的条件下对社员收入的分配，使用合作社的积累资金等，同时要具体地研究党、政、群基层组织的组织机构及其活动方式，以便符合于农业合作化运动的发展。”
    他说：“我们要大力地建立和发展重工业基础。我国重工业在今后五年内的建设和发展的主要方向是：促使电力工业的领先发展，注重钢铁工业和机器制造工业的发展，同时发展建筑器材工业和初步建立化学工业。”
    他还指出：“随着重工业基础的建设，要努力发展轻工业。”同时，“必须有计划、有领导地发展地方工业。”
    黎笋说：“全面、大力和稳步地发展农业是北方工业发展的基础。工业越发展越需要农业的发展。”
    他说：“在国民经济中，农业起着很重要的作用。在第一个五年计划期间，我们虽然比过去更重视工业的发展，但这并不意味着我们忽视了农业。恰恰相反，正是因为我们更重视工业的发展而更加重视农业。”
    黎笋在第五部分讲到加强人民民主政权、巩固北方人民在政治和精神上的统一的问题，他强调说：“人民民主政权必须坚决实行专政，才能够完成自己的历史使命。为了实行专政，我们的政权不但只用革命的法律而且还要采取思想斗争和政治斗争的方式来击败敌对的势力。一方面必须注重加强国防，加强人民的武装和半武装力量、健全作为加强人民民主专政的锐利武器的人民公安机关、人民检察院和人民法庭；另方面，必须动员和组织人民群众进行政治斗争，以便镇压反革命分子。同时要向落后分子进行思想斗争，以便教育他们。”
    他说：“在我国还处于被分割的情况下，美帝国主义及其走狗已把我国南方变为美国的殖民地和军事基地，并正在加紧扩充军备和准备侵略战争，人民民主政权应当时刻重视加强国防力量，人民军队就是这个力量的核心。”
    他指出：“为了使人民民主政权完成自己的任务，必须巩固和加强国家机构”；“必须加强各级国家机关的作用，并且在国家机关的生活中正确地实现民主集中制”；“人民民主政权必须特别注意加强与人民群众的联系，努力克服官僚主义。”
    他强调：“人民民主政权只有在紧靠着人民，并受人民的监督以及得到工人阶级政党的领导的时候，才能稳固和强大。只有在党的领导下，国家才能执行无产阶级专政的历史任务。”
    随后，黎笋在第六部分中讲到加强国际团结积极为保卫和巩固世界和平而奋斗的问题。
    他说：“我们正生活在人类历史上从来未有过的伟大的时代中。这是以从资本主义过渡到社会主义为基本内容的时代；是社会主义已经成为世界体系，并且在国际舞台上获得明显的优势的时代；是社会主义、民族独立、民主和平力量超过帝国主义力量的时代；是革命运动无比强大的发展和帝国主义正在走向不可挽救的灭亡的道路的时代。”
    他说：“今天，以苏联为首的世界社会主义体系已经成为一个统一的和强大的整体，包括十二个国家和十亿人口，即占全世界人口总数的三分之一强和占世界总面积的四分之一。社会主义阵营在许多方面的力量已超过帝国主义的力量，并成为目前世界形势发展的决定因素。社会主义日益显示出自己的优势和对于全世界劳动人民日益有着强大的吸引力。”
    黎笋指出：“苏联和社会主义阵营的政治、经济和科学技术力量日益强大的发展，是表明着社会主义比资本主义占有绝对优越性的不可争辩的标志。全世界的劳动人民和被压迫民族日益认识到社会主义阵营是他们寄以最大期望的源泉，是鼓舞他们在为人类的自由、独立和幸福而斗争的道路上的最光辉的典范。”
    他指出：“社会主义阵营的强大，各被压迫民族的迅速觉醒，已经强有力地推动了世界民族解放运动。近年来，这种运动已经在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲迸发并蓬勃发展，而且已相继地取得了胜利。”
    黎笋说：“社会主义、民族独立和世界民主和平力量的强大发展已经大大加速了帝国主义不可避免的崩溃过程。资本主义的总危机日益深重。”
    他说：“上述情况已经证明今天在全世界范围内的力量对比已起了根本的变化：社会主义、民族独立、和世界民主和平力量已经压倒世界好战的帝国主义的力量，并正在把这个势力逐渐推向孤立的地步。这个形势已经创造了防止世界新的战争的实际可能性，同时，这个可能性正在日益增长。”
    他接着说：“但是，我们不能忘记：帝国主义就是战争的根源，帝国主义还存在一天，人类就一天受到战争的威胁。好战分子，首先是美帝国主义的好战分子，还在顽固地继续进行侵略政策和战争政策。它们仍然继续加紧扩充军备，进行军备竞赛，加强西德的军国主义，加紧复活日本军国主义的势力和千方百计地维持‘冷战’。美国U—2型飞机和最近RB—47型飞机侵犯苏联领空进行军事侦察的事件，明显地揭露了美帝国主义好战的真面目。今后它们还将用尽一切手段来破坏世界的和平。因此，全世界爱好和平的人民必须不断地提高警惕，为维护和巩固和平作出更大的努力。”
    他说：“美帝国主义是世界爱好和平人民最凶恶的敌人。最近，美帝国主义好战分子及其走狗们在疯狂地进行破坏和平事业的活动中暴露了它们极其反动和好战的本质。世界人民最重大的任务，是必须进行积极的斗争，以维护和巩固和平，反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的挑衅阴谋。1957年11月在莫斯科举行的各社会主义国家的共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言已经明确地指出：‘现在，争取和平、争取和平共处成了世界各国最广大群众的要求。各国共产党认为争取和平的斗争是自己的首要任务。它们将同一切爱好和平的力量在一起，竭尽全力来防止战争。’”
    黎笋说：“社会主义的本质就是和平。社会主义各国需要和平，以便把力量集中于经济和文化的建设，提高劳动人民的生活水平。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，是保卫和巩固世界和平的伟大事业的中坚力量。”
    他说：“社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动更加团结一致，则世界革命运动将更加得到蓬勃的发展，而马克思列宁主义战无不胜的旗帜也将更加在进步的人类面前高举起来。正是因为这样，所以帝国主义者和它们的走狗就用尽一切手段进行破坏社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结一致。在这些活动中，南斯拉夫修正主义者扮演了一个极其卑鄙的角色。但是世界各个共产党和工人党已经坚决地批判了修正主义，并且揭露了南斯拉夫修正主义者背叛马克思列宁主义的真面目，使它们的挑拨离间的阴谋遭到可耻的失败。”
    黎笋指出：越南党和政府的外交政策的基本内容是：
      “（一）继续加强我国同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国之间的团结一致。巩固我国同兄弟国家之间牢不可破的友谊，按照无产阶级国际主义原则来发展我国同各个兄弟国家之间的互助合作关系，同时为加强国际共产主义运动的团结作出贡献。
    “（二）坚决同各个兄弟国家和全世界爱好和平的人民继续进行共同的斗争，以保卫和巩固和平，反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，实现不同政治和社会制度各国之间的和平共处，实现裁减军备和禁止核武器，取消在其他国家的军事基地和军事侵略集团，进而建立欧洲和亚洲的集体安全体系。
      “我们热烈欢迎和完全支持苏联政府关于全面和彻底裁减军备的倡议，和最近苏联政府关于取消原子武器和核武器的运输工具的建议。
    “我们也热烈欢迎和完全支持中国政府关于亚洲各国和太平洋区域各国（包括美国）共同签订一项互不侵犯的和平条约，并把整个亚洲和太平洋区域变成为无核武器区域的建议。
    “（三）积极支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民反对殖民主义和争取民族独立的斗争运动。在和平共处五项原则和万隆会议的十项原则的基础上加强同各个民族主义国家之间的友好关系，并同他们发展经济、文化的合作关系。
    “对于各个邻国，我们希望在互相尊重独立、主权和互不干涉内政的基础上来建立和发展良好关系。我们欢迎柬埔寨王国当前的和平中立政策，并进一步加强同柬埔寨王国的友好关系。我们支持老挝人民为实现和平中立政策和民族和睦的斗争，并希望同老挝王国建立永久和牢固的友好关系。我们随时准备同所有国家在平等互利的基础上建立友好关系。
      “（四）为关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议的彻底履行而坚决斗争，以便维护印度支那和东南亚的和平，进而实现越南国家的和平统一。
      “（五）在同各国政府建立和加强友好关系的同时，应当扩大我国人民同各国人民之间的友好关系。”
    黎笋在最后部分谈到关于党的问题。
    他说：“三十年来的革命经验，证明了我们党的领导是决定我国人民取得一切胜利的基本条件。因此，要使我们党在革命的现阶段中能够完成自己的任务，关键的问题仍然是不断地加强党的领导。”
    黎笋说：“我们党具有团结和统一的传统，这是我们的宝贵财产。我们应该努力发扬和提高这一宝贵的传统。我们党的团结和统一是有原则性的。这种团结和统一的基础是思想上高度的统一和组织上巩固的统一。为了加强党内的团结和统一，我们必须关心和加强党的思想统一和组织统一。”
    他说，“关于思想的统一问题，只能在工人阶级的马克思列宁主义的思想、立场上才能稳固地建立起来。”
    他说：“总之，在革命的现阶段中，我们党内的思想工作是为了在有系统地进行马克思列宁主义教育的基础上，来提高无产阶级思想，反对资产阶级影响的思想，反对小资产阶级思想，继续消灭封建主义和其他非无产阶级思想的一切残余。这是我们党内长期的思想工作方向。在每个时期去进行思想工作的时候，又要根据当前的政治任务和干部、党员的思想情况以及具体时期的革命要求给这个方向定出具体的内容。”
    他说：“在进行思想教育和思想斗争工作的同时，必须对错误的政治倾向和教条主义的表现进行斗争，并且特别注意防止修正主义，并把它视为目前革命运动中的主要危险。坚决维护党的政治路线和纲领，保卫和提高党的领导作用。”
    黎笋最后说：“我们党的这次全国代表大会在我国革命历史中有非常重大的意义。由大会提出的革命路线，是照耀着我国人民走向社会主义，统一国家，建立一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南的道路的一座光芒万丈的灯塔。
    “在马克思列宁主义旗帜下，在以敬爱的胡志明同志为首的我们党的战无不胜的旗帜下，越南人民万众一心，为把这个革命路线变成现实、争取光辉的未来而努力奋斗。”
