How I Became a Theory Instructor
Wu Shufen, Young Cook at Hegang City, Heilongjiang Province

I am a cook in the stove at the "Tianjin Baozi Shop" in Hegang City, a Communist Party member, and also serve as the secretary of the Youth League branch and a political theory instructor in our service industry.

I became a theory instructor in the second half of 1958. I didn't become a theory instructor because of my high level of theoretical knowledge, but because of the needs of everyone learning theory and the needs of the Party's work. I only studied for five years in the past, and I only started learning theory in March 1958. In the past year or two, the number of workers studying theory has been increasing day by day. By the second half of last year, more than ninety people in our industry were participating in the study. Because I was the secretary of the Youth League branch and also did the Party's propaganda work, I led the study every time. I read a paragraph from the book, and everyone discussed it. There were many questions that were not clarified. Everyone said that this kind of study was not very effective and asked for someone to give lectures. Our Youth League branch also reported this situation to the Youth League District Committee, requesting a solution to the problem of instructors, and also asked leading comrades to give lectures everywhere. At this time, the Municipal Party Committee instructed that the problem of worker theory instructors should be solved by adopting the method of "the able serve as teachers" and "using local materials." Our Party branch decided to let me be a part-time theory instructor based on the spirit of the Municipal Party Committee's instructions. At that time, I dared not accept this task. The Party branch secretary repeatedly encouraged me to learn while teaching and pointed out that if no one else gave lectures, everyone's study would be affected. Therefore, based on the spirit of Chairman Mao's saying, "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger cubs," I became a theory instructor. Although I took on this task, my level was ultimately low, and I failed when I gave the first lesson on "Two Types of Contradictions with Different Natures." During the lecture, I was afraid of making mistakes, so I just read from the book, but everyone kept asking me: What is a contradiction? How did contradictions come about? etc. After class, the comrades reflected that reading from the book did not solve the problem. I myself was very anxious and went to the Party branch secretary and asked, "What if I can't teach?" The Party branch secretary said that if it didn't work this time, it would work next time, and encouraged me not to be discouraged. I also remembered what Chairman Mao said in "On Practice," that "failure is the mother of success," and this gave me more energy. At the same time, the Party branch secretary specifically helped me analyze the main reason why I didn't teach well, which was that I hadn't understood the essence of the theory clearly and was afraid of saying something wrong, so I just read from the book. Accepting this lesson, I prepared for several days with the specific help of the Party branch secretary and gave the second lecture on "Two Types of Contradictions with Different Natures"... That's how I started giving theory lessons, going from unfamiliar to familiar. In the past two years, I have given a total of forty-six lectures.

Chairman Mao told us: "Educators must first be educated," which is very correct. People like me simply couldn't teach if they didn't study well first. When I was lecturing on "On Contradiction," I couldn't explain concepts such as "what is a world outlook?" and "what is metaphysics?" How to solve these problems? I only have one trick, which is to first work hard to understand the principles. If I didn't understand some problems, I would go to the Party branch secretary and the theory instructors of the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department for advice. For example, when I was preparing to lecture on "How to Correctly Understand Objective Things" in "On Practice," I was confused by what "On Practice" pointed out: "The difference between rational knowledge and perceptual knowledge is that perceptual knowledge belongs to the partial, phenomenal, and external connections of things, while rational knowledge takes a big step forward and reaches the whole, the essence, and the internal connections of things..." People's understanding of things always starts with understanding phenomena and the surface, and then they see the essence of things. Therefore, to see problems, one must see through the phenomena to see the essence. After checking materials and getting help from leaders, I finally understood this principle. Later, I explained it to the service staff in simple terms: to see problems, one cannot rely solely on one's own feelings, but one must look at problems comprehensively. Relying solely on feelings will lead to mistakes. In order to explain this problem clearly, I also took the rightist Ma Yongqiu as an example. Ma Yongqiu was superficially diligent, kind to people, but behind his back, he spread reactionary remarks attacking the Party and the people. These remarks reflected the ideological essence of the rightists. To be able to see this essence, one must conduct a comprehensive analysis through the superficial phenomena and cannot rely solely on feelings. After explaining this, everyone understood that one cannot only look at the phenomena and not the essence when understanding problems; if one is confused by the phenomena, one will not be able to distinguish between truth and falsehood and will be deceived. The comrades said that my lectures not only explained the principles clearly but also solved problems and were helpful to learning. This also encouraged me to study better and increased my courage to give lectures. However, to give good theory lessons, it is not enough to just read Chairman Mao's works; one must also frequently study the Party's policies and guidelines. If one does not understand the policies and guidelines, one cannot study theory more deeply and combine theory with current reality.

In the past two years, I have been learning and teaching, teaching and learning. I have not only understood many of the Party's policies and guidelines, but also systematically read "On Practice," "On Contradiction," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Marx, Engels, and Lenin on Communist Society," and some articles in "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." After studying, it not only helped me give good lectures, but also improved my ideological awareness and promoted my work.

Giving theory lessons is not only about clarifying the viewpoints, but more importantly, it is about being able to explain and solve practical problems.

In order to solve practical problems well, I study the ideological and work problems of the comrades in our unit before each lecture. After grasping these situations, I take two methods to solve them. One method is to consciously link with practical problems when systematically lecturing on basic theory courses. For example, since 1958, because the cafeteria has expanded, a lot of new service personnel have been added. Some of them have a bad attitude towards work and often say strange things. The Party branch proposed that if the idea of not loving the catering industry is not resolved, the quality of service will not be good. Therefore, when I lectured on the topic "Two World Outlooks" in "On Contradiction," I focused on analyzing this problem in connection with reality. It was explained that today's catering service personnel serve the laborers and serve socialist construction. The proletarian world outlook believes that this is glorious work. Viewing this work as "lowly," "serving people," dirty, tiring, and hopeless is the bourgeois world outlook... After this lesson, some people examined themselves in the discussion. Later, when I lectured on "Internal Causes and External Causes," I focused on analyzing the problem of service personnel arguing with customers. It was explained that what Chairman Mao said, "The fundamental cause of the development of things is not external but internal, in the contradictions within things... External causes are the conditions of change, internal causes are the basis of change, and external causes play a role through internal causes," arguing with customers cannot be blamed on the customers, because no customer is prepared to argue with the service personnel or the chef before eating. It is mainly caused by the service personnel not taking good care of them, so the main reason lies in the service personnel. Since this lesson, the service personnel's attitude towards work has changed. In particular, with the implementation of the resolutions of the Sixth-Level Cadre Conference on Finance and Trade work, I also lectured on "The Catering Industry Must Establish Three Major Viewpoints of Serving Politics, Serving the Masses, and Serving Production." In the discussion, everyone further criticized the ideological viewpoints of not loving the service industry and "sitting at home waiting to do business" and wrote pledges. In this way, the service attitude of our cafeteria has greatly changed. The service personnel not only warmly receive the customers who come, but also deliver meals and dishes to the mine shafts and residential areas, so they receive thousands of letters of thanks every month.

Another method is to give lectures on topics specifically addressing problems in work or ideology. For example, in the second half of last year, when carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, some people thought: "We don't have technical knowledge or materials, so we can't do it." In response to this idea, I gave a lesson on "Giving Play to Human Subjective Initiative," explaining that all theories are created through practice, without practice there is no theory, and therefore no technical knowledge; people are able to exert their subjective initiative, and if they do not practice and explore objective laws in practice to benefit mankind, but just sit in the room and say it can't be done, it can't be done, this is a conservative ideology and has not given play to subjective initiative. At the same time, the achievements of technical innovation in the "March 8th" Restaurant in Harbin were specifically introduced. This boosted everyone's enthusiasm. They all started to use their brains to engage in innovation, and some small reform projects such as automatic water tank covers and spittoon covers were successively successful. But when it came to making a vegetable cutting machine, it failed three times, and some people lost their energy. In response to this idea, I gave a lesson on "On Practice" entitled "Failure is the Mother of Success," explaining that people's understanding of objective truth cannot be achieved by one practice, but must go through a repeated process. Practice, understanding, re-practice, re-understanding, repeated many times, can we grasp the key, figure out the law, and achieve success. After this lecture, everyone continued to work hard again, and after five tests, they finally made the vegetable cutting machine. Now our cafeteria has basically achieved mechanization and automation.

Through such continuous lectures linking with reality, not only have practical problems been effectively solved, but also service personnel have better grasped the theory. Now everyone can generally use some philosophical principles to analyze and study their own work. They said: Only by studying in this way can we understand theory and use theory.

"Theory is the guide to action," but how can educators turn the theory they teach into the students' guide to action? My experience is that I must first practice myself and set an example.

In the past two years, my lecture ability has continued to improve, and this is the result of the Party's education. The Party not only promptly pointed out the shortcomings of my lectures, but also specifically helped me improve my teaching level. In order to cultivate and train me, I was also assigned to give more than ten lectures to cadres in the Municipal Party School and the mine. All of this, for me, is a process of learning and a process of being educated. These lectures have further promoted my learning. It should be said that I am still very immature in all aspects. In the future, I should better study Mao Zedong Thought and improve my awareness so as to better complete all the tasks assigned to me by the Party.

    我是怎样当理论教员的
    黑龙江省鹤岗市青年厨师　武树芬
    我是鹤岗市“天津包子铺”的菜灶厨师，是共产党员，还兼任我们服务业的团支部书记和政治理论教员。
    我是在1958年下半年当理论教员的。我当理论教员并不是因为我理论水平高，而是因为大家学理论的需要和党的工作需要。我过去只念过五年书，学理论是从1958年3月才开始的。最近一两年，学习理论的工人一天天地多起来，到去年下半年，我们行业就有九十多人参加学习。因为我是团支部书记，又作党的宣传工作，所以每次都是我领着学习。我照书念一段，大家讨论一段，有不少问题没有弄清，大家说这样学，收效不大，要求有个人给讲课。我们团支部也把这个情况向团区委反映过，要求给解决教员问题，同时也到处请领导同志给讲课。正在这时，市委指示解决工人理论教员问题要采取能者为师、就地取材的办法，我们党支部便根据市委指示精神，决定让我当兼职理论教员。当时我是不敢接受这个任务的。党支部书记一再鼓励我要边教边学，并且指出了如果再没人给讲课，大家的学习就要受影响了。因此，我就本着毛主席讲的“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”的精神，当起了理论教员。虽然我担起了这项工作，可终究还是水平低，在讲头一课《两类性质不同的矛盾》时就失败了。讲课时我怕出错，只是照本念，可是大家一个劲问我：什么是矛盾？矛盾是怎么来的呢？等等。课后，同志们反映照本念，不解决问题。我自己也很着急，就找党支部书记说，讲不了怎么办？党支部书记说这次不行下次就行了，又鼓励我不要泄气。我也想起了毛主席在《实践论》里说的“失败者成功之母”的话，这才又来了劲头。同时，党支部书记又具体帮助我分析没讲好的主要原因，是自己没有理解清楚理论的精神实质，又怕讲错，所以就照本念了。接受这个教训，我在党支部书记的具体帮助下，又准备了好几天，把两类性质不同的矛盾讲了个第二回……。我就是这样一次生两次熟地讲起理论课来了。两年来我共讲了四十六次课。
    毛主席告诉我们：教育者必须首先受教育，这是非常对的。像我这样的人，要不先学好，干脆就讲不了。我在讲《矛盾论》时，对什么是宇宙观？什么叫形而上学等等概念都讲不透。怎么解决这些问题？我只有一招，就是先从学通道理上下功夫。有些问题弄不懂，就去找党支部书记、市委宣传部的理论教员请教。如我在准备讲《实践论》中的“怎样正确认识客观事物”时，对《实践论》中指出的：“论理的认识所以和感性的认识不同，是因为感性的认识是属于事物之片面的、现象的、外部联系的东西，论理的认识则推进了一大步，到达了事物的全体的、本质的、内部联系的东西……”。人们认识事物总是先从认识现象、表面开始，然后才看到事物的本质。所以看问题要透过现象看本质。这个道理经过查资料，请领导帮助，终于弄明白了。以后我才通俗地给服务员讲：看问题不能光凭自己的感觉，要全面地看问题。光凭感觉就要犯错误。为了说清楚这个问题，我还拿右派马永秋作例子。马永秋表面工作殷勤，待人和气，可是却在背后散布向党和人民进攻的反动言论。这些言论就反映了右派的思想本质。要能看到这个本质，就要透过表面现象进行全面分析，不能光凭感觉。经过这样讲，大伙就明白了认识问题不能只看现象，不看本质；如果叫现象迷糊住，就分不清真假，就要上当。同志们说我这样讲课，不光道理说得明白，又能解决问题，对学习有帮助。这也鼓舞了我更好地学习，增加了讲课的勇气。可是要讲好理论课，光读成本的毛主席著作还不够，还得经常学习党的方针政策，如果不懂方针政策，就不能更深入地学习理论，把理论和当前实际结合起来。
  两年来，我就这样地先学后教，边教边学，不仅懂得了许多党的方针政策，还比较系统地读了《实践论》、《矛盾论》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《马恩列斯论共产主义社会》和《毛泽东选集》中的部分文章。经过学习不仅帮助我讲好了课，而且也提高了我的思想觉悟，促进了工作。
    讲理论课，不仅要把观点说清楚，更重要的是能说明和解决实际问题。
    为了很好地解决实际问题，每次讲课前，我都研究一下我们单位同志的思想问题和工作问题。掌握了这些情况后，我就采取两种方法去解决。一种方法是通过系统地讲基础理论课时，有意识地联系实际问题。比如在1958年以来，因为食堂扩大，增加了不少新服务员，他们中有的工作态度不好，还常说怪话。党支部提出这种不热爱饮食业工作的思想不解决，服务质量是不会好的。因此，我在讲《矛盾论》的《两种宇宙观》一题时，就着重联系实际分析了这个问题。说明今天饮食业的服务员是为劳动者服务的，是为社会主义建设服务的，无产阶级世界观认为这是光荣的工作。把这种工作看成是“低级”、“侍候人”、又脏又累没出息的工作，是资产阶级的世界观……。上完这课后，有些人在讨论中检查了自己。后来我在讲《内因与外因》一课时，又着重分析了服务员同顾客吵嘴的问题。说明毛主席讲的“事物发展的根本原因，不是在事物的外部而是在事物的内部，在于事物内部的矛盾性……外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据，外因通过内因而起作用”，与顾客吵架是不能怪顾客的，因为没有一个顾客准备先和服务员或厨师吵一架，然后再吃饭的，主要是服务员没照顾好而发生的，所以主要原因在于服务员这方面。从讲了这课以后，服务员的工作态度有了改变，特别是贯彻财贸工作六级干部会议的决议，我又讲了“饮食业必须树立为政治、为群众、为生产服务三大观点”。在讨论中，大家更批判了不热爱服务行业工作和“坐家等着做买卖”等等思想观点，并写了保证书。这样，我们食堂的服务态度就大为转变了。服务员不但对来的顾客热情接待，而且还送饭送菜到矿井和居民点中去，因此每月收到了上千封感谢信。
    另一种方法就是针对工作上或思想上的问题，单独提出题目讲课。比如在去年下半年，开展技术革新与技术革命时，有些人认为：“咱们没技术知识，没材料搞不了。”针对这种思想我就讲了一课《发挥人的主观能动性》，说明一切理论是通过实践创造出来的，没有实践就没有理论，也就没有技术知识；人是能发挥主观能动作用的，如果不去实践，在实践中摸索客观规律，为人类造福，只是坐在屋里说不行，不行，这是保守思想，没发挥主观能动性。同时还具体地介绍了哈尔滨“三八”饭店技术革新的成就。这样就鼓起了大家的干劲。他们都开动脑筋搞革新，一些小的改革项目如自动水缸盖、痰桶盖相继成功了。但到搞切菜机时，试验三次没成功，有的人泄劲了。针对这个思想，我又用“失败是成功之母”为题讲了《实践论》一课，说明人认识客观真理不是一次实践就能做到的，必须经过一个反复过程。实践、认识、再实践、再认识，多次反复，才能抓住关键，摸清规律，取得成功。经过这次讲课后，大伙才又继续干起来，试验了五次，终于搞成了切菜机。现在我们食堂里基本上实现了机械化和自动化。
    经过这样不断地联系实际讲课，不仅有效地解决了实际问题，还使服务员更好地掌握了理论。现在大家一般地都能运用些哲学道理分析研究自己的工作。他们说：只有这样学习，才能懂理论，用理论。
      “理论是行动的指南”，但作教育工作的人怎样才能把讲的理论变成学员的行动指南呢？我的体会就是要自己先去实践，作出榜样来。
    两年来，我的讲课能力不断提高，这都是党教育的结果，党不但及时指出我讲课的缺点，而且具体帮助我提高教学水平。为了培养锻炼我，还分派我到市党校、矿山给干部讲过十多次课。这一切对我来说，都是学习的过程，受教育的过程，通过这些讲课更促进了我的学习。应当说，现在我在各方面还都是很不成熟的，今后我应该更好地学习毛泽东思想，提高觉悟，以便更好地完成党所交给的一切任务。
