    Zhu Yuqi Loves Agricultural Production
    She, a young female Communist Party member, is one of the thousands of new-style rural youth active on the agricultural front. The shock brigade she leads tirelessly makes revolution in the fields, fights against nature, and regards agricultural labor as an endless joy in life. She is full of ideals for the future...
    Zhu Yuqi is the captain of the youth shock brigade of the Wangjiaqiao Production Team of the Zhangqiao People's Commune in Pudong County, Shanghai, and also an excellent militia backbone member. She is twenty-two years old this year. In 1958 and 1960, she went to Beijing twice to attend the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Units and the National Militia Representatives Conference, and met the beloved leader Chairman Mao both times.
              Establishing Lofty Aspirations to Build a New Countryside
    This daughter of a poor peasant was liberated at the age of eleven, like millions of other impoverished peasants. In the days of overturning and struggling against landlords, she followed her cousin, village cadre Zhu Jinfu, from village to village, helping cadres wipe tables, carry stools, and prepare for meetings. People laughed at her as a "little cadre." At that time, a question arose in her careful mind: The landlords have already been overthrown, so what are my cousin and those cadres still busy with all day long? They don't even have time to plant their own fields. On the way home in the dark of night, she told her cousin her question. Zhu Jinfu replied, "Although the landlords have been overthrown, there are still many things we need to do to make everyone live a prosperous life. How can we only think about our own affairs?" Her cousin's words were deeply imprinted in her heart. Yuqi has been continuously improving her ideological understanding and class consciousness under the cultivation and education of the Party.
    In 1953, when the Party called for organizing to engage in production, she took the lead and organized a mutual aid team with eight poor peasant households. Whenever rice and cotton entered critical periods such as heading, grain filling, and budding, Yuqi always managed everyone's fields well first, and then let everyone work on her own fields. The team members felt she was selfless, and unanimously elected her as the mutual aid team leader the following year. She was only fifteen years old that year and was the youngest mutual aid team leader in Yangjing District at that time. She actively responded to the Party's call and led local farmers to take the road of agricultural cooperativization. Soon after, under the cultivation and education of the Party and the help of comrades, she joined the Communist Youth League and the Party, becoming a shock worker on the agricultural production front.
              Wholeheartedly Cultivating the Land
    One day in the summer of 1957, Zhu Yuqi and everyone were rushing to plant vegetables under the scorching sun when she suddenly received an urgent letter from her sister, who worked in Shanghai: Her sister was about to give birth, and there was no one to take care of the older child, so she wanted her to go and help immediately. Her sister sent letter after letter urging her, begging her; her mother also wanted her to go and help her sister quickly.
    When Yuqi arrived at her sister's house, her body was in the city, but her heart was still concerned about agricultural production in the countryside. She couldn't stand this "leisurely" life. Every morning, when she took her shopping basket to buy vegetables, she often said to herself, "I am a vegetable grower, but now I have become a vegetable buyer!" She couldn't wait to return to the countryside to grow vegetables. Her sister sometimes told her that the factory had recently added new machines, and if the countryside could increase cotton production, the factory's production could be continuously improved. This sentence touched her heart: How could a cotton grower leave her battle post? Zhu Yuqi felt very sad. That night, she went to sleep and got up again, and went to sleep and got up again. After her nephews and nieces were asleep, she spread out the letters from Party branch secretary Zhu Jinfu and her good sister Wang Peixin and read them repeatedly. She couldn't stand it any longer and asked her sister the next day to let her take the children to the countryside so that she could go and plant vegetables and cotton sooner. Her sister was moved by her urgency and agreed to let her take the children to the countryside.
    Soon after, a relative came to find Zhu Yuqi and said, "Some factories are recruiting workers now. Would you like me to introduce you?"
    Yuqi thought for a moment and simply said, "I'm not going. Production in the fields is very tight. Everyone is striving for high yields. Losing one laborer means less yield."
    The relative said in surprise, "Some people can't wait to get into a factory. Farming is so hard!"
    As soon as Yuqi heard that farming was hard, she felt angry and immediately replied, "It is glorious to be a worker, and it is also glorious to be a farmer. If no one engages in agriculture, where does food and clothing come from? Speaking of hardship, the countryside is hard, and the factory is also hard. How can we young people be afraid of hardship?"
              Overcoming Nature and Seizing High Yields
    Yuqi has always regarded fighting against nature and overcoming difficulties as her greatest pleasure. She is "enthralled" by agriculture and "enthralled" by high yields. She always looks for the most difficult work to do and always picks the heaviest tasks. Transforming "homesteads" this spring is one example. Originally, in their more than thirty-five mu of high-yield cotton fields, four mu were "homesteads," with piles of stones and bricks and overgrown weeds. They had not been planted with crops for decades, and no one wanted to plant this land. When Yuqi wanted to plant this land, some people said with a mocking tone, "Cotton can't be grown on stones, and crops can't grow on bricks." Some individuals in the shock brigade also lacked confidence and were afraid of not doing well and being laughed at. Yuqi felt that to achieve high yields, they couldn't allow this "homestead" in the middle of the entire field, so she was determined to dig out all the stones and bricks from this land. She organized the team members to study the story of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and told everyone, "Roads are made by people, and fields are opened up by people. If the Foolish Old Man could move mountains, can't we even move a few big stones?"
      "Yes! We must move them. We're just afraid that we won't have enough time to plant the flowers." Some team members supported Yuqi but raised a concern. Yuqi said with confidence, "This is a good point. I've thought about it too. If we really don't have enough time to plant, we'll plant transplanted cotton. The land is dead, but people are alive. It's not heroic to seize high yields on good land. It's heroic to seize high yields on barren land!" Seeing that the captain was so determined, the team members also became firm.
    After the bricks on the ground were moved away, they found ways to plant cotton. Now the cotton in this "homestead" has grown to two or three feet high. The team members said happily, "We have really brought the dead land back to life, calling it 'growing cotton on stones and growing crops on bricks!'"
    Zhu Yuqi's spirit of hard struggle and dedication has been consistent for several years. As early as the winter of 1957, when Zhu Yuqi and the youth planted the first cotton experimental field, the temperature was often below zero, and the base fertilizer for the cotton field had not yet been settled. Yuqi and her younger sisters used up the chicken coop ash and soil from the corners of their homes, but it still didn't solve the problem. The Party branch proposed "asking the riverbank for base fertilizer and asking river mud to contribute its strength." At that time, some people said, "River mud is a very good base fertilizer, but going to the river in such cold weather will either freeze you to death or stiffen you!" Some young people stuck out their tongues when they heard this. Zhu Yuqi did not hesitate to take off her shoes, roll up her trouser legs, and take a hoe, saying, "A warm heart is not afraid of the cold." She went into the river and started knocking on the ice with a bang. The sisters were greatly moved and followed one after another, finally digging up enough river mud to use as base fertilizer. However, when the cotton branches were tall and leafy and the flowers were in full bloom, it rained for twenty-three consecutive days, and a large number of cotton buds fell off, threatening to turn the high-yield field into a "low-yield field." Everyone was very anxious when they saw this situation. Zhu Yuqi herself had to brave the wind and rain to see the cotton field day and night, but she couldn't think of a solution for a while. One day, the Party committee secretary told her that the bud shedding was due to a lack of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer, and that crabs and river mussels were rich in phosphorus and potassium fertilizer. Zhu Yuqi was extremely happy when she heard this. She thought that as long as she could prevent bud shedding, she was willing to do anything. After dinner that day, she invited a few young girls to catch crabs and river mussels in the river. They crushed the crabs and river mussels, fermented them, and applied them to the fields as fertilizer, but then they encountered another difficulty. The cotton grew too densely. Not to mention that the manure buckets could not be carried in, even people could not walk in. What to do? Yuqi went home and used her enamel basin to fill it with fertilizer and slowly climbed into the cotton field, applying it to the cotton field basin by basin. When the girls saw Zhu Yuqi doing this, they followed suit. Although the rotten crabs and river mussels smelled terrible, they happily said, "The cotton field has been 'fed meat,' and high yields can't run away. When we think about it then, this fertilizer will be more fragrant than perfume!" Their sweat was not in vain. The cotton bud shedding was quickly controlled, and new cotton bolls grew out one by one.
    Zhu Yuqi and the girls of the shock brigade broke through one difficulty after another in this way, creating a high-yield record of more than 1,200 jin per mu of cotton, and were rated as an advanced collective to attend the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Units.
            Exploring the Laws of Crop Growth
    Yuqi often thought this way: How can we harvest more grain, cotton, and vegetables on each mu of land? Since people can turn low-yield fields into high-yield fields, they must be able to master the laws of crop growth. Under the guidance of this idea, she wanted to understand things that others understood; she wanted to understand things that others didn't understand; she learned from others what others had already done; and she did things herself that others had not yet done. She especially liked to plant high-yield crops in low-yield fields and carefully observe the laws of crop growth. In the past two or three years, she has planted experimental fields of rice, cotton, carrots, and rapeseed, and has successively experimented with pruning cotton leaves, hybridizing corn and cotton, artificial pollination of pumpkins, and hybridizing balsam and cotton to turn white cotton into colored cotton. When planting the carrot experimental field, Zhu Yuqi's sowing period was one month earlier than the general fields. Several farmers with experience in planting carrots advised her, "Planting carrots in such hot weather will only result in centipede-like radish whiskers." Yuqi felt that this made sense, so in order to grow large radishes instead of centipede radishes, she deeply plowed more than a foot, applied more than 100 dan of base fertilizer per mu, and watered the seedlings with cold water to lower the soil temperature, making the seedlings neither sparse nor dense... When the carrots were harvested, each one weighed more than a jin, and the largest ones reached one jin and fifteen taels. The nine fen of land planted with carrots yielded more than 13,000 jin. When relevant units in Shanghai heard this news, they sent people to the team to select more than 200 jin of large carrots and sent them to the National Agricultural Exhibition in Beijing.
    No matter what crop it is, as long as it is in Zhu Yuqi's hands, she will conduct some experiments. One day in July this year, the Party committee secretary of the commune asked Yuqi, "Have you ever thought about why rice used to be harvested only once a year, but now it can be harvested twice a year?" The Party committee secretary only said half a sentence, and Yuqi continued, "Yes, can cotton also be harvested twice a year?" She turned around and discussed it with her younger sisters, determined to greatly increase cotton production. Now, the double-season cotton seedlings they have cultivated are already five or six inches high, and the time for planting is coming soon.
    Speaking of Zhu Yuqi, everyone says that she is a good girl who is diligent in learning and asking questions. In fact, Zhu Yuqi is not only diligent in learning and asking questions, but also dares to think and act. She loves whatever she does and wants to study it thoroughly. The purpose of her diligence in learning and asking questions is to master more agricultural scientific and technological knowledge and master more skills to fight against nature.
    When Zhu Yuqi was planting cotton, many phenomena in the cotton growth process aroused her interest. She saw the Party branch secretary at the time, Zhu Jinfu, and asked, "What's the use of growing so many leaves on cotton? Why is there hair on the cotton stalks? What is the function of these hairs?" Zhu Jinfu said, "I don't understand the things you ask about. I heard people say at the meeting that the function of cotton leaves is the same as the function of human hands. People use their hands to take things to eat, and cotton leaves absorb nutrients to supply the cotton." Zhu Yuqi said with a smile, "I cut off the cotton's hands, no wonder the boll shedding increased." It turned out that she had cut off some cotton leaves for experimentation, which caused boll shedding. It was precisely because of this experiment that she promoted her understanding of the cotton growth process. However, the matter of the hair growing on the cotton stalk was still an unsolved mystery. Later, I heard technicians say that the hair on the cotton stalk is like the hair on a person's body and is an inevitable phenomenon in the cotton seedling growth process. But why is it an inevitable phenomenon? I still couldn't understand it. She tried every means to study it. It turned out that the hair on the cotton stalk was to protect the skin of the cotton stalk. She is so diligent in learning and asking questions, painstakingly studying, and exploring the laws of crop growth to make nature serve mankind.
    Some people think that engaging in agricultural production is unpromising, but Zhu Yuqi realizes that engaging in agricultural production is very promising. She often says: The countryside is a university, and there is a lot to be done. She is determined to be a farmer with intelligence and talent, to understand and master the laws of crop growth, to make every mu of land contribute more and better grain, cotton, and vegetables, and to quickly change the "poor and blank" face of the motherland. This is the real reason why she loves agriculture so much and is inseparable from the countryside.
              Selfless and Frugal for the Public Good
    In order to realize her lofty ideals, Zhu Yuqi always leads by example, puts the interests of the revolution first, works diligently, and lives a hard and simple life. The local people praise Yuqi as a good girl who knows how to manage a family. Indeed, Zhu Yuqi knows how to manage a family, but the "family" she manages is not a small family of one household, but a socialist "big family." For this "big family," she never spends an extra penny. She is also diligent and thrifty in dealing with her own life. Under her influence, the members of this shock brigade have developed a habit of diligence and thrift.
    Yuqi's family raised three hens, which laid two or three eggs every day. Her mother was never willing to eat them. Thinking that her daughter worked very hard, she often waited for her to come home and beat a few eggs to nourish her body. Yuqi usually understood her mother's concerns very well. She told her mother about the hard work of the steelworkers and machine workers she saw during her visits, saying, "They are more hardworking than us! They should be nourished first." The mother felt that her daughter's words were right. After the two discussed it, they saved a few jin of eggs and three chickens and sold them to the state. A younger sister advised Yuqi, "In the past, we were too poor to afford eggs. Now that life is better, why don't we enjoy it?" Yuqi said to her kindly, "We are young and have not yet made any contributions to the country. We should be more hard-working and simple in our lives. This is also a good exercise for ourselves."
    In this way, under the education of the Party, Zhu Yuqi has grown up day by day in class struggle and production struggle. She leads the youth shock brigade to make revolution in the fields all day long, fighting against the sky and fighting against the earth, taking the conquest of every inch of land and the seizure of every point of high yield as an endless joy in life; she is full of ideals for the future...

    朱玉琪热爱农业生产
    她，一个年轻的女共产党员，是活跃在农业战线上成千上万的新型农村青年之一。她所领导的一支突击队，不知疲倦地在田间闹革命，与天与地作斗争，把农业劳动当作生活中无穷的乐事。她对未来充满着理想……。
    朱玉琪是上海市浦东县张桥人民公社王家桥生产队的青年突击队队长，也是一个优秀的基干民兵，今年二十二岁。1958年和1960年她先后两次去北京，出席了全国农业先进单位代表会议和全国民兵代表会议，两次都见到了敬爱的领袖毛主席。
              立大志建设新农村
    这个贫农的女儿，在十一岁的时候，和千千万万个贫苦农民一样得到了解放。在闹翻身斗地主的日子里，她成天跟着堂哥哥、村干部朱金富，从这个村串到那个村，帮助干部揩桌子、端凳子，准备开会，人们都笑她是“小干部”。那时候，她小心眼里就产生了一个问题：地主已经斗倒了，堂哥哥和那些干部还一天到晚忙什么呢？连自己的田也来不及种。在半夜摸黑回家的路上，她把自己的疑问告诉了堂哥哥。朱金富回答她说：“地主虽然斗倒了，要大家过富裕日子，还有许许多多事情要我们做，哪能只想自己的事情呢？”堂哥哥的话，深深印在她的心里。玉琪就是这样在党的培养教育下，不断提高了自己的思想认识和阶级觉悟。
    1953年，在党号召组织起来搞生产的时候，她积极带头和八户贫农一起组织了互助组。每当水稻、棉花进入抽穗、灌浆、现蕾等关键时期，玉琪总是先把大家的田管好，然后再让大家给自己的田做活。组员们都感到她大公无私，第二年一致推选她当互助组长。这年她只有十五岁，是当时洋泾区年纪最小的一个互助组长。她积极响应党的号召，带领当地农民走农业合作化的道路。不久以后，她在党的培养教育和同志们的帮助下入了团，入了党，成为农业生产战线上的突击手。
              一心一意把地种
    1957年夏季的一天，朱玉琪和大家正在烈日下抢种蔬菜，忽然接到在上海做工的姊姊写来的一封急信：姊姊快生小孩了，大孩子没人管，要她马上去帮忙。姊姊一封封信来催她，央求她；妈妈也要她快些去帮姊姊的忙。
    到了姊姊家里，玉琪人在城市，心还是挂念着农村的生产。她耐不住这种“清闲”的生活。每天早晨，当她拿着菜篮买菜的时候，她常常自言自语地说：“我是种菜的人，现在变成买菜的人了！”恨不得马上回到农村去种菜。姊姊有时告诉她，厂里最近添制了新机器，要是农村能多增产些棉花，工厂的生产就能不断提高。这句话触动了她的心：一个种棉花的人，怎么能离开战斗岗位呢？朱玉琪感到很难过。那天晚上，她睡下去又爬起来，再睡下去又爬起来，趁着外甥们睡熟后，一个人摊开党支部书记朱金富和她的要好姊妹王佩新给她的来信，反复看了几遍。她再也耐不住了，第二天就要求姊姊把孩子让她带到农村去，让她自己早一天去种菜、种棉花。姊姊被她那种急迫的心情感动了，就同意她把孩子带到乡下去。
    不久，又有一个亲戚来找朱玉琪，说：“现在有些工厂在招工人，我介绍你去好不好？”
    玉琪想了一想，干脆说：“我不去，田里生产很紧张，大家都在夺高产，少一个劳动力就要少收一分产量。”
    这位亲戚惊奇地说：“有的人还巴不得进工厂，种田多苦！”
    玉琪一听说种田苦，她心里就生气了，立刻回答说：“做工人光荣，做农民也光荣。没有人干农业，吃饭穿衣从哪里来？讲艰苦，农村艰苦，工厂也艰苦，我们青年人哪能怕苦？”
              战胜自然夺高产
    玉琪一向把和自然作斗争、攻难关当作自己最大的乐趣。她“迷”于农业，“迷”于高产，尽找最难的活做，尽拣最重的工作干。今年春天她们改造“宅基地”就是一个例子。原来在她们所种的三十五亩多棉花丰产片里，有四亩是“宅基地”，石头、砖块成堆，杂草丛生，几十年没有种过庄稼，也没有人想种这块地。当玉琪要种这片地时，有些人就带着讥讽的口气说：“石头上种不出棉花，砖头上长不出庄稼。”突击队中也有个别人信心不足，怕弄不好，惹人家笑话。玉琪觉得要搞丰产片就不能叫整片土地中间有这块“宅基地”，就下决心要把这块土地上的石头、砖头挖光。她组织队员学习“愚公移山”的故事，告诉大家：“路是人走出来的，田是人开出来的，愚公能移山，我们难道连几块大石头还搬不掉吗？”
      “能！我们一定要把它搬掉。就怕种花的时间来不及了。”有的队员支持玉琪，但提出了一个担心的问题。玉琪充满信心地说：“这个问题提得对，我也想过，如果真的来不及种，我们就种移栽棉。地是死的，人是活的，好田夺高产不算英雄，荒地上夺高产才是好汉！”队员看到队长这样坚决，也都坚定起来了。
    地面上的砖头搬完了，她们就想办法种下了棉花。现在这片“宅基地”里的棉花，已长到两三尺高，队员开心地说：我们真的把死地种活了，叫“石头上长棉花，砖头上长庄稼了！”
    朱玉琪这种艰苦奋斗、埋头苦干的精神，几年来是一贯的。早在1957年冬季，朱玉琪和青年们种第一块棉花试验田时，气温经常在零度以下，棉田的基肥还没着落。玉琪和小姊妹们把家里的鸡棚灰、扦脚泥搞光了，但仍解决不了问题。党支部提出“向河滨要基肥，叫河泥献出力量”。当时有人说：“河泥是很好的基肥，可是这样冷的天下河去，不冻死，也要冻僵！”有的青年听了伸伸舌头。朱玉琪却毫不犹豫地赤了脚、卷起裤脚，拿了把铁鎝，说了声：“心热不怕冷。”就下河去乒乒乓乓敲起冰来，姊妹们大受感动，也就一个接一个地跟了下去，终于挖来了足够的河泥作基肥。可是当棉花枝高叶茂、花朵盛开的时候，一连下了二十三天雨，大批的棉蕾脱落了，丰产田有变成“低产田”的危险。大家看着这种情况，心里都十分焦急，朱玉琪自己不管白天黑夜，都要冒着风雨去看棉花田，可是一时也想不出办法。一天，党委书记告诉她，脱蕾是因为缺乏磷钾肥的缘故，而螃蜞、河蚌都含有丰富的磷钾肥。朱玉琪听到这句话以后可高兴得不得了。她想，只要能不脱蕾，什么都愿意干。那天饭后，她就约了几个年轻姑娘，到河滨里去捉螃蜞、摸河蚌。她们把螃蜞、河蚌捣碎，发酵后作肥料往田里施时，可是又遇到了困难，棉花长得太密，不要说粪桶挑不进去，连人也走不进去。怎么办？玉琪回家把自己用的搪瓷盆盛了肥料慢慢地爬进棉花田去，一盆一盆地垩在棉田里。姑娘们看到朱玉琪这样做，也跟着做了。尽管腐烂的螃蜞、河蚌臭味难闻，但是她们却高兴地说：“棉花田开了荤，高产跑不掉，到那时想一想，这肥料比香粉还要香！”她们的汗没有白流，棉花落蕾很快地被制住了，新的棉铃又一个个长了出来。
    朱玉琪和突击队的姑娘们就是这样艰苦地冲破了一个又一个难关，创造了棉花亩产一千二百多斤的高产纪录，被评为出席全国农业先进单位代表会议的先进集体。
            探索作物生长规律
    玉琪常常这样想：怎样才能在每亩土地上收到更多的粮食、棉花和蔬菜呢？人既然能够叫低产田变成高产田，那就一定能掌握农作物生长的规律。在这种思想指导下，别人懂得的事情，她都想懂；别人不懂的事情，她也要懂；别人已干了的，就向别人学；别人还没有干过的，就自己干。她特别喜欢在低产田里种高产作物，仔细地观察作物生长的规律。最近两三年来，她种过水稻、棉花、胡萝卜、油菜试验田，还先后试验剪棉叶、玉米与棉花杂交、南瓜人工授粉，还把凤仙花和棉花杂交，要把白色的棉花变成彩色的棉花等。在种胡萝卜试验田时，朱玉琪的播种期比一般田提早一个月，有几个种胡萝卜有经验的农民劝她说：“这样热的天种胡萝卜，将来只能收点百脚萝卜须。”玉琪一听，感到这话有道理，为了不长百脚萝卜而长出大萝卜，她就深翻一尺多，每亩施基肥一百多担，用凉水浇苗，使地温降低，苗不稀不密……。胡萝卜收获时，只只都在一斤以上，最大的几只胡萝卜达到一斤十五两，九分地种的胡萝卜收到一万三千多斤。上海市有关单位听到这个消息，派人到队里挑选了二百多斤大胡萝卜，送到北京全国农业展览会去展览。
    不管什么作物，只要到朱玉琪手里，她都要进行一番试验。今年7月的一天，公社党委书记问玉琪：“你想到过没有，水稻从前也是一年一熟，现在为什么能一年两熟？”党委书记的话只讲了半句，玉琪就接着说：“对，棉花是不是也可以一年两熟？”她转身就和小姊妹商量，决心叫棉花大增产。现在，她们培育的双季棉花秧，已有五六寸高，栽种的时刻马上就要来到。
    提起朱玉琪，大家都说，她是个勤学好问的好姑娘。其实朱玉琪不仅是勤学好问，而且是敢想敢干。她干什么就爱什么，还要追根究底地研究。她勤学好问的目的是为了掌握更多的农业科学技术知识，掌握更多的与自然斗争的本领。
    当朱玉琪种棉花时，棉花生长过程中的许多现象又引起了她的兴趣。她看到当时的党支部书记朱金富就问：“棉花长这么多叶子有什么用场，棉秆上为什么有毛，这些毛有啥作用？”朱金富说：“你问的这些事情，我也不懂得，我开会时听人家说，棉叶的作用和人手的作用一样，人用手拿东西吃，棉花叶吸收营养供给棉花。”朱玉琪笑着说：“我把棉花的手剪掉了，难怪落铃增加。”原来她为了试验，把一些棉花叶子剪掉了，引起了落铃。正因为她这次试验，促进了她对棉花生长过程的认识。但棉秆上长毛的事，仍然是个未解开的谜。后来才听到技术人员说，棉秆上的毛和人身上的汗毛一样，是棉苗生长过程中的必然现象。但为什么是必然现象呢，还是不能理解。她又千方百计去研究，原来棉秆上的毛是为了保护棉秆皮的。她就是这样勤学好问，苦心钻研，探索农作物生长的规律，叫大自然为人类服务。
    有人认为搞农业生产没出息，朱玉琪却认识到搞农业生产很有出息。她常说：农村是个大学堂，大有文章可作。她决心要当一个有聪明才智的农民，要认识、掌握农作物生长的规律，要叫每一亩土地贡献出更多更好的粮食、棉花和蔬菜，迅速地改变祖国“一穷二白”的面貌。这就是她为什么这么热爱农业，和农村难舍难分的真正原因。
              为公忘私勤俭朴素
    为了实现自己的远大理想，朱玉琪处处以身作则，把革命利益放在第一位，工作勤勤恳恳，生活艰苦朴素。当地的人们夸说玉琪是个会当家的好姑娘。的确，朱玉琪会当家，不过她当的这个“家”，不是一家一户的小家，而是社会主义的“大家”。她为了这个“大家”，从来不肯多花一分钱。处理自己的生活，她也是克勤克俭。在她的影响下，这个突击队的队员们已养成了勤俭节约的风气。
    玉琪家里养了三只老母鸡，每天生两三个蛋。她妈妈从来舍不得吃，想起女儿劳动很辛苦，常常等女儿回家，打几个蛋给女儿补补身体。玉琪平时很懂得体贴妈妈的心事，她把自己在参观时看到的钢铁工人、机器工人艰苦劳动的情形告诉妈妈，说：“他们比我们更辛苦呵！应该先让他们补补身体。”妈妈觉得女儿的话说得对，两个人商量以后，就把几斤蛋和三只鸡省下来，卖给了国家。有个小姊妹劝玉琪：“过去穷得吃不起鸡蛋，现在生活好了，为啥不享受享受呢？”玉琪和气地对她说：“我们年纪轻，对国家还没有什么贡献，在生活上更应该艰苦朴素，这对自己也是个锻炼。”
    就这样，朱玉琪在党的教育下，在阶级斗争和生产斗争中，一天天成长起来。她整天带领青年突击队在田间闹革命，与天斗争，与地斗争，把征服每一寸土地，夺取每一分高产，当作是生活中的无穷乐事；她对未来充满着理想……。
