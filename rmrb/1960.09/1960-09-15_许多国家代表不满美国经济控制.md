    U.S. Manipulates the Economic Conference of American States to Pass "Aid" Plan
    Many Countries' Representatives Dissatisfied with U.S. Economic Control
    Cuban Representative Exposes "Aid" Plan as a Political Tool of the U.S.
    Workers and Students in Bogota Demonstrate in Support of Cuban Revolution and Condemn the Economic Conference of American States
    Xinhua News Agency, Bogota, 13th: The Economic Conference of the member states of the Organization of American States, which began on the 6th in the Colombian capital, Bogota, concluded discussions on its agenda on the 12th after passing an empty $500 million so-called "aid" plan from the United States. The details of the plan will have to be determined at another special meeting to be held within sixty days by senior government representatives from various countries.
    The so-called "aid" plan of 500 million U.S. dollars provided by the United States and passed at the meeting is a "price" paid by the United States in an attempt to isolate and attack Cuba and eliminate the huge impact of the Cuban revolution in Latin America. The "Wall Street Journal," the mouthpiece of the American financial community, admitted in an editorial published on September 8 on the eve of the OAS Foreign Ministers' Meeting in San Jose that the plan, hastily put forward by the United States to "loosen" the "strings of its purse," was aimed at "stopping the spread of Castroism." When proposing this "aid" plan, the United States insisted that the countries receiving "aid" must "reform the tax system" and "reform credit institutions" as conditions for obtaining loans.
    During the meeting discussions, many Latin American countries' representatives expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S.'s "aid" plan, which was attached with harsh conditions, and whose purpose was to strengthen its control and plunder of Latin American countries. Federico Schmidt, head of the Brazilian delegation, openly accused that Brazil would not succumb to the loan conditions proposed by the International Monetary Fund controlled by Washington. Juan O's, head of the Bolivian delegation, and Jose Chiriboga, head of the Ecuadorian delegation, also voiced their accusations against the U.S. foreign aid agencies for "only caring about profits."
    Some Latin American countries also expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S.'s practice of driving down the prices of Latin American countries' raw materials and controlling the markets for these products. Juan O's, head of the Bolivian delegation, pointed out at the meeting that one of the reasons for Latin America's economic backwardness was the continuous decline in the prices of the raw materials they produced. He cited as an example that the United States froze the price of tin sold by Bolivia during World War II, causing the country a loss of 300 million U.S. dollars. Pastrana, head of the Colombian delegation, had requested the meeting to adopt a specific agreement on maintaining raw material prices. However, the meeting did not make any decision on the issue of raw material prices.
    The Cuban delegation voted against the U.S. "aid" plan when the meeting voted on it. It pointed out that the plan was a political tool of the United States. The Cuban delegation also pointed out that the meeting had failed to thoroughly discuss the issue of stabilizing the prices of Latin American countries' basic export commodities, as a result of the U.S. exerting pressure on the meeting. Prior to this, the Cuban delegation submitted four draft resolutions to the meeting on condemning the U.S. economic aggression against Cuba, formulating a plan for land reform in the Western Hemisphere, and strictly restricting foreign investment. These drafts were rejected under U.S. manipulation.
    It is extremely obvious that although this meeting passed the U.S.'s "aid" plan, it has not been able to eliminate the profound contradictions that have always existed between the United States and Latin American countries due to the U.S.'s economic plunder. The "New York Times," in an editorial published on September 6 looking forward to the meeting, admitted that these contradictions were irreconcilable. It said, "The main interest of Latin American countries has always been the economic development that emphasizes industrialization"; while "our (referring to the United States) main interest has always been private investment in order to obtain profits from minerals and agricultural products."
    Xinhua News Agency, 13th: According to a report from Latin American News Agency from Bogota, university students and workers in Bogota, the capital of Colombia, held demonstrations on the 10th to support the Cuban revolution and condemn the Economic Conference of Twenty-one Countries. The demonstrators chanted slogans along the way such as Fidel Castro and Down with the Economic Conference of Twenty-one Countries, and held placards condemning the Economic Conference of Twenty-one Countries and portraits of Castro. The demonstrators held a rally in Bolivar Square, where they were closely surrounded by the police. Alfonso Baverena, leader of the Liberal Party and member of the House of Representatives, severely attacked the U.S. "aid" plan in his speech at the meeting, saying, "The United States is trying to buy us off with 'U.S. aid' so that we will remain silent about its preparations for activities against Cuba."

### 许多国家代表不满美国经济控制

    美国操纵美洲国家经济会议通过“援助”计划
    许多国家代表不满美国经济控制
    古巴代表揭露“援助”  计划是美国的政治工具
    波哥大工人学生示威游行支持古巴革命谴责美洲国家经济会议
    据新华社13日讯　波哥大消息：6日开始在哥伦比亚首都举行的美洲国家组织成员国经济会议，在通过美国的一项空洞的五亿美元的所谓“援助”计划之后已经于12日结束了各项议程的讨论。计划的细节还得留待定于六十天内由各国政府高级代表举行的另一次特别会议去确定。
    会议通过的由美国提供五亿美元的所谓“援助”计划是美国企图孤立和打击古巴、消除古巴革命在拉丁美洲产生的巨大影响而付出的一笔“代价”。美国金融界的喉舌“华尔街日报”在9月8日就这次会议发表的社论中承认，美国在美洲国家组织圣约瑟外长会议召开前夕匆匆提出的这项答应“放松”它的“钱袋的绳子”的计划，其目的是为了“阻止卡斯特罗主义的蔓延”。美国在提出这项“援助”计划时坚持要求受“援助”的国家必须“改革税收制度”和“改革信贷机构”作为取得贷款的条件。
    在会议讨论过程中，许多拉丁美洲国家的代表对美国附有苛刻条件的目的在于加强它对拉丁美洲国家的控制和掠夺的“援助”计划表示不满。巴西代表团团长费德里科·施密特公开指责说，巴西将不能屈从这个由华盛顿控制的国际货币基金组织提出的贷款条件。玻利维亚代表团团长胡安·奥斯和厄瓜多尔代表团团长何塞·奇里沃加也同声指责美国援外机构“只关心利润”。
    一些拉丁美洲国家对美国压低拉丁美洲国家的原料产品价格和控制这些产品的市场的做法同样表示不满。玻利维亚代表团团长胡安·奥斯在会议上指出，拉丁美洲经济落后的一个原因是由于它们生产的原料价格的不断下降。他举例说，美国在第二次世界大战期间冻结了玻利维亚出售的锡的价格，使这个国家受到三亿美元的损失。哥伦比亚代表团团长帕斯特拉纳曾经要求会议通过一项关于保持原料价格的具体协议。但是会议并没有就原料价格问题作出任何决定。
    古巴代表团在会议就美国“援助”计划进行表决时，投票反对这项计划。它指出，这项计划是美国的一个政治工具。古巴代表团还指出，会议没有能够深入讨论关于稳定拉丁美洲国家基本出口商品价格的问题，是美国对会议施加压力的结果。在此以前，古巴代表团向会议提出了关于谴责美国对古巴进行经济侵略、制订一项在西半球进行土地改革的计划和严格限制外国投资等四项决议草案。这些草案在美国的操纵下被否决。
    极其明显，尽管这次会议通过了美国的“援助”计划，它并没有能够消除美国同拉丁美洲国家之间由于美国的经济掠夺而一直存在的深刻矛盾。“纽约时报”在9月6日发表的一篇瞻望这次会议的社论中，就曾经承认这些矛盾是不可调和的。它说，“拉丁美洲国家的主要兴趣一直在于着重工业化的经济发展”；而“我们（指美国）的主要兴趣一直在于为了从矿产品和农产品中获得利润的私人投资”。
    据新华社13日讯　据拉丁美洲通讯社自波哥大报道，哥伦比亚首都波哥大的大学生和工人10日举行了示威游行，支持古巴革命并谴责二十一国经济会议。示威群众沿途高呼菲德尔·卡斯特罗和打倒二十一国经济会议的口号，手里还拿了谴责二十一国经济会议的标语牌和卡斯特罗的画像。示威群众在博利瓦尔广场举行了集会，他们在那里受到警察的严密包围。自由党领袖、众议员阿方索·巴维雷纳在会上的讲话中严厉地攻击了美国的“援助”计划，他说，“美国企图用‘美援’收买我们，使我们对它准备反对古巴的活动保持沉默。”
