    Advanced Experiences Incorporated into Regulations
    (Xinhua News Agency) The steelmaking workshop of Tianjin No. 4 Steel Plant mobilized the masses to conscientiously summarize advanced experiences and incorporate them into operating procedures. Currently, the entire workshop has summarized over ninety advanced operating experiences, from charging to casting, and incorporated them into the operating procedures. This transforms the creations of a few into the wealth of all, and elevates the creations of the masses into regulations that everyone jointly follows, achieving immediate results in production. In August, the workshop's steel output increased by more than 22% compared to July, the steel qualification rate increased to over 96%, and the consumption of pig iron per ton of steel decreased by 8%.
