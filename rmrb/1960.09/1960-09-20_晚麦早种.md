　　Plant Late Wheat Early

　　This year, the multiple cropping index has increased, and the area of late autumn crops has also increased. Therefore, in this year's autumn sowing area, the proportion of stubble wheat and late stubble wheat will inevitably be quite large. Planting stubble wheat and late stubble wheat as fully and well as regular wheat and early stubble wheat is a particularly important link in ensuring area and quality in this year's autumn sowing.

　　Now, the sowing of regular wheat has begun in northern regions, and in some areas the sowing season for stubble wheat has also arrived. In order to strive for a bumper harvest next summer, in addition to continuing to work hard to rush-plant regular wheat and early stubble wheat, the most important task is to firmly grasp the planting of stubble wheat and late stubble wheat.

　　The yield of stubble wheat and late stubble wheat is generally lower than that of regular wheat and early stubble wheat. Why is this? People know that the natural conditions for stubble wheat and late stubble wheat are relatively poor. After the previous crop is harvested, the soil fertility has not been well restored, and the sowing time is relatively late. However, is this the entire reason for the lower yield? Are these conditions unchangeable? This is worth further investigation.

　　In recent years, more and more of the following phenomenon has appeared: In some areas, the yield per unit area of ​​stubble wheat and late stubble wheat is as high as that of regular wheat and early stubble wheat, and some even exceed that of regular wheat and early stubble wheat. In these places, we can see that what determines the yield is not the natural conditions of regular or stubble, early or late stubble, but the attitude people take towards them and the efforts they make.

　　According to a survey conducted by the Wheat High-Yield Research Group of the Northwest Institute of Biology and Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the Beishangzhai Production Team of Yujin People's Commune in Lintong County, Shaanxi Province: on the one hand, most of the three types of fields for wheat are stubble wheat; on the other hand, the yield of stubble wheat has also exceeded that of regular wheat, with a yield of more than 500 jin per mu, or close to regular wheat, with a yield of 300 to 400 jin per mu. What is the reason for the large difference in yield? According to their research, the main reason lies in the earliness of the sowing period, followed by whether the cultivation and management are meticulous and good. As long as people do not discriminate against stubble wheat and carry out cultivation and management according to their actual needs, they can repay with the same high yield as regular wheat. The agricultural scientific research department of Hebei Province has also conducted investigation and research on the problem of increasing the yield of late stubble wheat. The facts they have learned also prove that the yield of late stubble wheat planted in late autumn land can catch up with or even exceed the yield of early stubble wheat planted in early autumn land. The Miaozhuang Agricultural Science Research Institute in Yongnian County planted late stubble wheat in sweet potato fields, with an average yield of 600 to 700 jin per mu, which is higher than the yield of local early stubble wheat. The reasons for the increased production are also early sowing and the application of more base fertilizer, and another reason is the use of wheat varieties suitable for late stubble sowing.

　　Facts show that we can no longer look at stubble wheat and late stubble wheat with old eyes, nor can we treat stubble wheat and late stubble wheat with old methods. The yield of stubble wheat and late stubble wheat is lower than that of regular wheat and early stubble wheat, which is the result of people not using correct measures to treat them. This phenomenon was generally said to be impossible to change in the era of small-scale peasant economy; in the era of people's communes, the fundamental favorable conditions for reversing this phenomenon have been available. People's communes can uniformly plan land on a relatively large scale, rationally arrange stubble rotations, and use powerful collective forces to quickly harvest and plant, apply more base fertilizer, irrigate in a timely manner, and manage meticulously. Therefore, now we can not only increase the multiple cropping area more and more, but also make stubble wheat catch up with regular wheat more and more, and make late stubble wheat catch up with early stubble wheat more and more. In our country, with the continuous leap forward in production, people have grasped the laws of nature more and more accurately, and people's conscious initiative has been greatly enhanced. Under such circumstances, the multiple cropping index is increasing, and the area of ​​stubble wheat and late stubble wheat is also increasing, and it is inevitable that stubble will catch up with regular stubble and late stubble will catch up with early stubble. Only by adapting our thinking and actions to this situation can we occupy an active position in the struggle for production.

　　The key to increasing the yield of stubble wheat and late stubble wheat is to sow early, and we must do everything possible to ensure that late stubble is not planted late. According to existing experience in various places, the main methods for planting late stubble early are: promoting the early maturity of autumn crops, and speeding up the harvesting speed, so as to free up stubble early; transporting base fertilizer to the fields early, and irrigating once in areas with insufficient soil moisture before late autumn harvest, so as to cultivate early; intercropping between rows in late autumn, or raising seedlings and transplanting. For late stubble land that really cannot be planted early, varieties with greater spring characteristics can be used. There must be many locally effective methods in various places. As long as the masses are mobilized, and the masses deeply understand the importance of running agriculture in a big way and running food production in a big way, and deeply understand the possibility of expanding the multiple cropping area and increasing the yield per unit area under the current favorable conditions, and are liberated from the shackles of old habits and old ideas of "late stubble will inevitably have low yield", they will definitely be able to find many ways to plant early, plant more, and plant well.

　　With the area of ​​stubble wheat and late stubble wheat greatly increased, striving for stubble wheat and late stubble wheat to catch up with regular wheat and early stubble wheat can increase the total output considerably. If the yield of one mu of stubble wheat and late stubble wheat catches up with that of regular wheat and early stubble wheat, it is entirely possible to increase the yield by 40 to 50 jin compared to the past. Forty to fifty jin per mu, and one hundred million mu is four to fifty billion jin. If you want to get more of these wheat, the most important thing is to catch the season and race against time. "Time is grain" is an absolute truth. We must mobilize the masses to think of all possible ways and take out all forces to race against time for autumn sowing. We must ensure that regular wheat and early stubble wheat are sown in a timely manner, and we must strive to make stubble wheat and late stubble wheat catch up with regular wheat and early stubble wheat.

### 晚麦早种

    晚麦早种
    今年复种指数提高了，晚秋作物增加了，因此，回茬麦、晚茬麦在今年秋播面积中势必要占相当大的比重。把回茬麦、晚茬麦同正茬麦、早茬麦一样地种足种好，是今年秋播中保面积、保质量的一个特别重要的环节。
    现在，正茬麦的播种在北方地区已经开始，有些地区回茬麦也已经到了播种季节。为了争取明年夏季大丰收，除了继续努力抢种正茬麦、早茬麦以外，最要紧的工作就是紧紧抓住回茬麦、晚茬麦。
    回茬麦、晚茬麦的产量，一般要比正茬麦、早茬麦低一些。这是怎么回事呢？人们都知道，回茬麦、晚茬麦的自然条件比较差，前茬作物收获以后，地力没有很好的恢复，播种时间又比较迟。可是，这是不是产量较低的全部原因呢？这些条件是不是不可改变的呢？这就值得进一步深究了。
    近几年来，越来越多地出现了这样的现象：有些地区的回茬麦、晚茬麦的单位面积产量同正茬麦、早茬麦的单位面积产量一样高，有的甚至超过了正茬麦、早茬麦。在这些地方，我们可以看到：决定产量的并不是正茬或回茬、早茬或晚茬的自然条件，而是人们对于它们采取怎样的态度，作了怎样的努力。
    据中国科学院西北生物土壤研究所小麦丰产研究组在陕西临潼县雨金人民公社北尚寨生产队所作的调查：一方面，小麦的三类田中，大部分是回茬麦；另方面，回茬小麦的产量也有超过正茬的，亩产量达到五百斤以上，或者同正茬麦不相上下，亩产量达到三、四百斤。产量高低悬殊的原因何在？据他们研究，主要在于播种期的迟早，其次在于耕作和管理是不是细致、良好。只要人们不歧视回茬麦，并且按照它们的实际需要进行培育管理，它们就能以正茬麦同样高的产量来报答。河北省农业科学研究部门对晚茬麦增产问题也作了调查研究，他们了解到的事实也证明：在晚秋地里种的晚茬麦的产量，能够赶上甚至超过在早秋地里种的早茬麦的产量。永年县苗庄农业科学研究所在甘薯地里种的晚茬麦，每亩平均产量达到六、七百斤，比当地早茬麦的产量还高。增产的原因也是提早播种和多施底肥，还有一个原因是采用了适宜晚茬播种的小麦品种。
    事实说明，不能再用老眼光看回茬麦和晚茬麦，也不能再用老办法对待回茬麦和晚茬麦。回茬麦、晚茬麦的产量比正茬麦、早茬麦低，是人们没有用正确的措施对待它们的结果。这种现象，在小农经济时代一般地说是无力改变的；在人民公社时代，已经具备了扭转这种现象的根本有利条件。人民公社可以在比较大的范围内统一规划土地，合理安排茬口，可以运用强大的集体力量快收快种，多施底肥，适时灌溉，精细管理。因此，现在我们既能够越来越多地增加复种面积，又能够使回茬麦越来越多地赶上正茬麦，使晚茬麦越来越多地赶上早茬麦。在我国，随着生产的持续跃进，人们对自然规律掌握得越来越多、越来越准，人们的自觉的能动性大大地增强了。在这种情况下，复种指数在增加，回茬麦、晚茬麦的面积也在增多，回茬赶正茬、晚茬赶早茬也是必然的趋势。只有使思想和行动适应这样的形势，才能在生产斗争中居于主动地位。
    回茬麦、晚茬麦增产的关键是提早播种，必须千方百计争取晚茬不晚种。根据各地已有的经验，晚茬早种的主要办法是：促使秋庄稼早熟，并且加快收割速度，以便早腾茬口；提早把底肥运到田间，墒情不足的地方在晚秋收割以前就灌一次水，以便早耕；也可以在晚秋行间套种，或者育苗移栽。实在不能早种的晚茬地，可以采用春性较大的品种。各地一定还有许多当地行之有效的办法。只要把群众发动起来，使群众深切了解大办农业、大办粮食的重要性，深切了解在当前有利条件下扩大复种面积、提高单位产量的可能性，从“晚茬必然低产”的旧习惯、旧思想的束缚中解放出来，就一定能找出早种、多种、种好的许多办法。
    在回茬麦、晚茬麦面积大大增加的情况下，争取回茬麦、晚茬麦赶上正茬麦、早茬麦，能够增加的总产量是很可观的。一亩回茬麦、晚茬麦的产量如果赶上了正茬麦、早茬麦，比过去增产四、五十斤是完全可以作到的。一亩四、五十斤，一亿亩就是四、五十亿斤。要想多拿到这些麦子，最要紧的就是赶季节、争时间。“时间就是粮食”，这是千真万确的事实。我们要发动群众想尽一切办法、拿出一切力量为秋播争取时间。一定要使正茬麦、早茬麦适时播种，一定要力争回茬麦、晚茬麦赶上正茬麦、早茬麦。
