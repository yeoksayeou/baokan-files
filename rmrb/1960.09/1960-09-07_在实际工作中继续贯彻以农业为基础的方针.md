Continue to Implement the Policy of Taking Agriculture as the Foundation in Actual Work
Secretary of the Handan Municipal Party Committee, Zhou Ji

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong's thought that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, the Party organizations at all levels in Handan City have always regarded agricultural production as their central task, following the instructions of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee. In the particularly busy seasons of drought-resistant sowing, summer harvesting, and autumn harvesting over the years, a small number of cadres were kept in the offices, while the vast majority of cadres went to the forefront of agricultural production. In the arrangement of rural labor, the number of people投入going to the forefront of agricultural production has always accounted for the absolute majority. During the winter and spring "Hundred Days," we resolutely implemented the "three-thirds system" principle for labor use instructed by the Hebei Provincial Party Committee; and for several years, all sectors of society have provided strong support for agriculture. Especially since 1958, we have held high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, relying on the collective strength and wisdom of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and waged a tenacious struggle against nature with an overwhelming force, enabling agriculture to achieve continuous bumper harvests. The continuous Great Leap Forward in agriculture has, in turn, driven the comprehensive upsurge of industry and other sectors of the national economy. Taking 1958 as an example, the city's total agricultural output value increased by 28.82% compared with 1957. Because agriculture provided more raw materials to industry, the total industrial output value in 1959 increased by 64.33% compared with 1957. The continuous Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in the past two years has enabled Handan City to basically form a coal and steel industrial base and a strong textile industrial base. It has also changed the historical grain shortage situation of Handan City as an economic crop area, achieving self-sufficiency in grain. This is a huge leap in agricultural production in Handan City. This has made us realize even more profoundly that to develop the national economy at a high speed, agriculture must be the foundation. Experience in the past two years has proved that without the growth of grain and the adequate supply of industrial raw materials, it is impossible to quickly develop industry and invigorate the work of other sectors of the national economy. However, conversely, agriculture cannot achieve high-speed development without the strong support of industry and other sectors. Without the support of all sectors of society, the agricultural front cannot obtain sufficient machinery, power, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, science and technology, health care, and so on. To continue to resolutely implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, all sectors of society must vigorously support agriculture.

	A New Upsurge of Mass Support for Agriculture from All Sectors of Society is Widely Launched Throughout the City
    It is precisely because the whole Party and the whole people have correctly recognized the principle that developing the national economy at high speed must be based on agriculture, since the beginning of this year, a new upsurge of mass support for agriculture from all sectors of society, unprecedented in scale, has continued to emerge in Handan City. This new upsurge significantly marks the arrival of a period of upsurge based on agriculture. Its prominent features are "the whole Party attaches importance, organized in sets, targeted at agricultural seasons, guarantees needs, when to use, delivered on time, political, economic, cultural, technological, everything that should be there, all-inclusive." From the scope of view, it has shifted from past temporary support to regular support; from single sporadic support to diverse and comprehensive support; from the actions of a few factories and mines to a mass movement of all sectors of society. All sectors of society have regarded supporting agriculture as their own duty and have transformed supporting agriculture into a conscious action.

    In the industrial sector, there are currently twelve industrial bureaus (companies) in the city, each contracting with a county; more than 560 enterprises are linked with 130 communes throughout the city. The Party Committee Secretaries and factory directors of many industrial enterprises personally led teams to visit counties and communes. On the basis of understanding the needs of the communes, 195 enterprises and 120 communes have signed support contracts. Due to the support of mechanical industrial units, a large number of irrigation tools have played a huge role in the drought resistance struggle. The city's daily irrigation area has rapidly increased from 120,000 mu to 200,000 mu. The factories and mines also manufactured and collected a batch of various machine tools for the communes in April and May, according to the needs of agricultural technical transformation, equipping the commune's mechanical repair shops, so that each commune has two to four machine tools for manufacturing and repairing agricultural machinery and tools. The electric power industry sector has provided many power equipment to help communes build water and thermal power stations and pumping stations, creating favorable conditions for realizing agricultural electrification. In the technical transformation of supporting agriculture, many enterprises also adopted the methods of "inviting in" and "sending out," training a large number of technical personnel for the communes, providing technical guarantees for improving the utilization rate of agricultural machinery.

    More than 60,000 employees in the financial and trade sectors are making every effort to vigorously support agriculture from the aspects of financial resources, materials, and service activities: from past door-to-door delivery to square-field supply; from only managing supply to ensuring installation, maintenance, and use, fully responsible and all-inclusive. Financial and trade work has developed from the logistics department of production to the counselors of production; from the supply department of the masses to the stewards of the masses. Since January to May this year, the value of agricultural production materials supplied by the financial and trade sectors has increased by 82% compared with the same period last year. In the huge movement of all sectors of society supporting agriculture, the following achievements have been made: First, the industrial enterprises have helped communes build more than 1,900 small factories for producing production materials, producing more than 1,500 kinds of local fertilizers, small farm tools, etc., directly providing production materials for agriculture, reversing the situation that material supply has long relied on foreign aid. Second, after multiple warehouse cleanups, more than 250 kinds of production materials have been cleared out; combined with handicraftsmen going to the countryside to repair farm tools, various mechanical farm tools have been matched into complete sets, achieving the best use of materials. Third, raising funds for agriculture and supporting poor teams, so that more than 1,200 poor teams have caught up with the income level of rich teams. Fourth, vigorously helping communes organize economic life; establishing supply stations, pavilions, and groups in agricultural high-yield areas, and setting up consignment and purchasing points in commune canteens. This has created a network of services scattered all over the city, convenient for members, saving time, and promoting production.

    Under the slogan of "researching what agriculture needs, dedicating technology to agriculture, and ensuring the health of the agricultural labor force," the cultural and educational departments have launched a magnificent upsurge in supporting agriculture. With the help of various cultural and educational units, there are currently 550 agricultural middle schools in the city, with an average of 3.2 agricultural middle schools per commune. Various units have also trained a large number of technical talents equivalent to middle and primary levels for the countryside through various methods such as spare-time technical education, short-term training, master-apprentice teaching, and on-site training. Under the guidance of the policy of combining education and labor production, and education serving production, middle schools and above in the city have established factories and farms on a large scale, also manufacturing a lot of production materials for agricultural production. Nangong Zhao Zhuang Normal School alone produced 240,000 jin of bacterial fertilizer to support agriculture. Teachers and students of various levels and types of schools also actively participated in various rural labor activities within the prescribed labor time, making a total of about 20 million workdays in half a year. Scientific research departments have helped communes and production teams in ten counties and districts establish 16,000 agricultural research institutes, stations, and groups, and trained 57,700 farmer technical researchers, providing a new force for agricultural technical transformation. Medical and health departments, focusing on agricultural production, promptly organized medical personnel to go deep into the fields and construction sites to participate in production and carry out mobile medical services, ensuring the health of the vast laboring masses and the water conservancy army. The vast number of professional literary and artistic workers went to the mountains and countryside to perform for farmers, and helped various grassroots units to widely carry out spare-time cultural activities, making the rural cultural life unprecedentedly active, greatly improving the socialist consciousness of the vast number of farmers, and inspiring the production enthusiasm of the farmers.

	Tremendous changes have taken place from the economic base to the superstructure.
    Due to the vigorous support of agriculture by all sectors of society, especially industry, agricultural production in the first half of this year has also won new and great victories. First of all, since last winter, a national mass movement to carry out farmland water conservancy has been formed throughout the city. In addition to the new construction and expansion projects of the Dongfeng Canal and Minyou Canal, and the construction of Yuecheng and Sanqi Reservoirs, five new reservoirs with more than one million cubic meters, 146 small reservoirs, 24 irrigation areas with more than 10,000 mu, 19,068 small canals, and 115 pumping stations have been completed. 1,175 motor-pumped wells have been drilled, expanding the city's irrigated area to 13.7 million mu, accounting for 71.5% of the total cultivated area. Especially after March this year, the speed of water conservancy construction was accelerated even faster in the case of no rain for a long time, and a bitter battle was launched with the drought demon. Not only was sowing successfully completed and a bumper wheat harvest was obtained, but also great achievements were made in the management of field crops. Secondly, with the great development of the national economy based on agriculture, major changes have also taken place in the cropping system. At present, 63% of the total cultivated land in the city has been built into 15,782 high-yield areas. Pig farms, fertilizer factories, and repair shops have also been established in these high-yield areas. This reform of the cropping system and the further comprehensive application of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture have created excellent conditions for a large increase in agricultural production and the modernization of agriculture. At the same time, an agricultural high-yield competition movement centered on realizing grain crossing the Yellow River and cotton crossing the Yangtze River in advance has been launched. This movement is developing vigorously and steadily. The determination and confidence of the vast number of commune members to fundamentally change the economic outlook of Handan City in three to five years have become more firm.

    In the process of implementing the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, the political, economic, cultural, and technical aspects of the countryside have been fully developed. This has not only guaranteed the continuous leap forward in agricultural production, but also tremendous changes have taken place in the field of the superstructure. The relationship between urban and rural areas, between workers and peasants, and between leaders and the masses has become closer. The communist consciousness of commune members has been greatly improved. They have expressed their determination to thank the leadership of the Party and the selfless support of the worker brothers by winning a bumper harvest in agriculture. Lingshui and Dayu management areas of Lingshui Commune in Fengfeng Mining Area, with the strong support of the Mining Bureau and the Construction Bureau, have greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses for production and the spirit of communist cooperation after realizing water conservancy. They have drawn out 6,000 laborers to support the drought resistance struggle in the Fengfeng management area. Three communes in Julu County wrote 170 letters of thanks to the Xingjiawan Machinery Factory. The praise given by the members of the Haozhuang Production Team in the suburbs to the workers was: "In previous years, repairs were made in Handan, but this year repairs are made in the fields. Thank the good leadership of the Party, guaranteeing a bumper harvest for ten thousand years." After the medical department launched the "Four Guarantees" (guaranteeing production teams, guaranteeing high-yield areas, guaranteeing households, and guaranteeing canteens) and "Five Deliveries" (medical treatment delivered to the door, medicine delivered to the door, visits delivered to the door, follow-up visits delivered to the door, and prevention delivered to the door) movement, the masses praised: "The new society is really good. Doctors come without being invited, both treating diseases and participating in production, it is really a good hospital led by Chairman Mao." Encouraged by the support of agriculture from all sectors of society, the vast number of members are working with great enthusiasm, and a mass technical revolution and technical innovation movement on a magnificent scale is developing rapidly.

	Some Preliminary Experiences
    In the process of implementing the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, we have gained the following experiences.

    First, adhere to putting politics in command, strengthen the leadership of the Party, and repeatedly explain the important significance of accelerating the development of agriculture, so that the whole Party and the whole people can further improve their ideological understanding of taking agriculture as the foundation and first grasping agriculture, and improve their consciousness of supporting agriculture. In this regard, we have especially strengthened specific ideological leadership. First of all, in the leading core of Party organizations at all levels, we repeatedly clarified the great significance and specific methods of pairing factories and communes, and then carried out ideological education to the entire Party members, cadres, and employees in various departments with great fanfare. In carrying out the movement to support agriculture, we promptly commended the advanced units and advanced workers who had made outstanding achievements in supporting agriculture, and at the same time, criticized some cadres for regarding supporting agriculture as an "extra burden" and a "temporary task," as well as the various erroneous ideas that put industrial production in opposition to supporting agriculture. Because the vast number of cadres have a correct understanding of the relationship between workers and peasants, the relationship between urban and rural areas, and the relationship between agriculture and the entire national economy, the determination to support agriculture has been greatly enhanced. In specific work, all departments have established special organizational institutions for supporting agriculture and determined special personnel. These institutions have played a huge organizational role in supporting agriculture under the unified leadership of the Party Committee.

    Second, of course, high-speed development of agricultural production requires funds and materials, but the most important task at present is to arrange sufficient labor for agriculture and give full play to the enthusiasm of each laborer. Therefore, in the continuous leap forward in agricultural production, in addition to timely supplying the funds and materials needed for agriculture, we also especially regard the arrangement of agricultural labor as the primary task. Recently, the Municipal Party Committee, in accordance with the instructions of the higher Party Committee and the actual situation of the city, stipulated that the labor force used for agricultural and animal husbandry production throughout the year should account for 70% of the total rural labor force, and in different seasons, the labor force invested in agricultural production must be maintained at more than 80%. During the winter and spring "Hundred Days," it is necessary to continue to implement the "three-thirds system" principle for labor use stipulated by the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, that is, in addition to logistics labor, the labor force used for field management, fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production, the labor force used for forestry, fishery, sideline occupations, and community-run industries, as well as short-distance transportation, and the labor force used for water conservancy and other farmland basic construction, each accounts for about one-third of the rural labor force. In the seasons of particularly busy agricultural work, we adopted the method of drawing up cadres from organs and concentrating rural labor to fight a war of annihilation with a superior force, and carried out continuous major assaults and major promotions of agricultural production. Facts have proved that production has developed rapidly wherever this has been done seriously. The Fengli Production Team of Datong Commune in Wu'an Mining Area is a vivid example. This team has a total of 240 households, 290 laborers, and 2,969 mu of cultivated land. Among them, dry land is 2,874 mu, accounting for 96.8% of the total cultivated land, and wheat accounts for 21%. In the case of no rain for more than 200 days last winter and this spring, the team not only maintained full attendance of full laborers, but also many semi-laborers participated in production. After the people's struggle, not only did the team's wheat harvest a bumper harvest, but also made great achievements in the management of autumn crops.

    Third, in the process of implementing the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, the "two-five system" leadership method was generally promoted throughout the city. The vast majority of cadres in various leading organs went deep into the front line of production, eating, living, working, and discussing with the members; and spent a certain amount of time conducting collective research and study, so that the ideological and theoretical level and professional work level of the cadres were greatly improved, thereby further improving the style of work, mastering the work method of the mass line, and achieving learning from doing, helping from learning, solving small problems locally, and solving major problems in a timely manner. Because the style of work of the cadres was further deepened into the masses and deepened into production, the enthusiasm of the members became greater and greater, and the production efficiency became higher and higher. Wang Deheng, the magistrate of Shexian County, went deep into Guantaochuan and worked with the members to dig springs and find water. The members said with emotion: "The county magistrate entered the mountain, and the water was drawn out of the mountains, and people and animals have water to drink, and dry land becomes paddy fields. How to repay, refueling production." Many cadres made intimate friends with the masses in participating in labor, and the close relationship between cadres and the masses was further developed.

    Fourth, the main content of supporting agriculture in all sectors of society must start from the most urgent needs of agricultural production in each season. Around the overall goal of accelerating agricultural technical transformation and promoting the continuous leap forward in agriculture, we have provided manpower and material resources to the following aspects of agricultural activities: drought resistance to protect wheat, drought resistance for spring sowing, summer harvesting and summer planting, autumn field management, and the tools urgently needed for farmland water conservancy construction in current agricultural production, drainage and irrigation machinery, repair lathes, small power station equipment, fertilizer factory equipment, etc. At the same time, we have timely helped grassroots organizations arrange labor and mass life. This approach is very popular among the masses. Its advantage is that the support goals are clear, in line with the actual needs of agricultural production, and can achieve immediate results.

    At present, the mass movement of all sectors of society supporting agriculture in Handan City is developing in depth after achieving the above-mentioned great achievements. However, from the overall situation, the development of the movement is not balanced enough, and the work of some units cannot fully meet the needs of the continuous leap forward in agriculture. In response, the Municipal Party Committee has recently held a special meeting to conduct research and put forward new measures. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant light of the Party's general line of building socialism, as long as we further mobilize the strength of all sectors of society to support agriculture more forcefully, and further mobilize cadres and the masses at all levels to study key production increase factors, carry out agricultural basic construction on a large scale, and accelerate agricultural technical transformation, we will definitely be able to seize a more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production, and thereby promote a comprehensive leap forward in the entire national economic construction.

    在实际工作中继续贯彻以农业为基础的方针
    中共邯郸市委书记处书记　周基
    邯郸市各级党组织，在毛泽东同志的农业是国民经济基础的思想指导下，根据中共河北省委指示，一向都把农业生产作为自己的中心任务。在历年的抗旱播种和夏收、秋收等农事特别繁忙的季节里，经常以少数干部留在机关，绝大多数干部深入农业生产第一线。在农村劳动力的安排上，投入农业生产第一线的人数也是一贯占绝对优势的。在冬春百日，我们坚决贯彻执行了中共河北省委指示的劳力使用的“三三制”原则；并且几年以来各行各业都对农业进行了大力的支援。特别是从1958年以来，我们高举着总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，依靠了工农商学兵五位一体的集体力量和智慧，以排山倒海之势，向自然界进行了顽强的斗争，使农业生产得到了连续大丰收。农业的连续大跃进，又带动了工业和国民经济其他各部门的全面高涨。以1958年为例，这年全市农业总产值比1957年增长28.82％。由于农业向工业提供了较多的原料，工业的总产值在1959年比1957年增长64.33％。两年来工农业生产的连续大跃进，已使邯郸市基本形成一个煤炭、钢铁工业基地和强大的纺织工业基地。从此也改变了邯郸市作为一个经济作物区历史性的缺粮面貌，粮食达到自给自足。这是邯郸市在农业生产上的一个巨大飞跃。这使我们更加深刻地体会到，要高速度地发展国民经济，必须以农业为基础。两年来的经验证明，如果没有粮食的增长，没有工业原料的充分供应，要想很快地发展工业和活跃国民经济的其他部门的工作是不可能的。但是，反过来，农业要想得到高速度的发展，没有工业和其他行业的大力支援也是不行的。如果没有各行各业的支援，农业战线就不可能得到足够的机械、动力、化学肥料、农药、科学技术和卫生保健等等。要继续坚决地贯彻执行以农业为基础的方针，各行各业必须大力支援农业。	全市广泛开展各行各业群众	  性支援农业的新高潮
    正是由全党全民正确地认识到了高速度地发展国民经济必须以农业为基础的道理，今年以来，邯郸市在全市范围内继续出现了一个声势空前浩大的各行各业群众性的支援农业的新高潮。这个新的高潮显著地标志着以农业为基础的高涨时期已经到来。它的显著特点是“全党重视，组织成套，针对农时，保证需要，何时使用，按时送到，政治、经济、文化、技术，应有尽有，无所不包”。从范围上来看，由过去临时性的支援，走向了经常性的支援；由单项的零星的支援，走向了多样性的全面的支援；由几个厂矿的行动，发展成为各行各业群众性的运动。各行各业都把支援农业当成了自己分内的任务，把支援农业变成了一个自觉的行动。
    工业部门，目前全市已有十二个工业局（公司），按县包干；五百六十多个企业分别和全市一百三十个公社挂了钩。许多工业企业的党委书记、厂长亲自带队到县、社访问，在摸清公社需要的基础上，已经有一百九十五个企业单位和一百二十多个公社签订了支援合同。由于机械工业单位的支援，大批灌溉工具在抗旱斗争中发挥了巨大的威力，全市日浇地由过去的十二万亩，迅速提高到二十万亩。各厂矿还根据农业技术改造的需要，在4、5月份为公社制造和筹集了一批各种机床，装备了公社的机械修配厂，使每个公社都有了二至四台制造和修理农业机械农具的机床。电力工业部门，拿出许多电力设备，帮助公社筹建了水、火发电站和扬水站，为实现农业电气化，创造了有利条件。许多企业单位在支援农业的技术改造中，还采取“请上来”、“派下去”的方法，为公社培训了大批的技术力量，对提高农业机械的利用率，提供了技术上的保证。
    财贸部门的六万多名职工，正在千方百计地从财力、物力和服务活动上大力支援农业：由过去的送货上门，发展到方田供应；由只管供应，发展到保安装、保修配、保使用，全面负责，一包到底。财贸工作由生产的后勤部，发展成为生产的辅导员；由群众的供应处，发展成为群众的管家人。今年1至5月份以来，财贸部门供应农业生产资料的价值就比去年同期增长82％。在各行各业支援农业的巨大运动中，已经取得了如下成果：第一，各工业企业，已帮助公社建起生产生产资料的小型工厂一千九百多个，生产出土化肥、小农具等一千五百余种，直接为农业提供了生产资料，扭转了物资供应长期依靠外援的局面。第二，经过多次清理仓库，清理出各种生产资料二百五十余种；结合手工业部门职工下乡修配农具，使各种机械农具成龙配套，达到了物尽其用。第三，为农业筹措资金，支援穷队，使一千二百多个穷队赶上了富队的收入水平。第四，大力帮助公社组织经济生活；在农业丰产方建立供应站、亭、组，在公社食堂设立代销代购点。作到了大方有站，中方有亭，小方有组，食堂有部。在全市范围内形成了一个星罗棋布的服务网，方便了社员，节约了时间，促进了生产。
    文教部门在“农业需要什么就研究什么，把技术献给农业，确保农业劳动大军身体健康”的口号下，掀起了规模壮阔的支援农业的高潮。经过各文教单位的帮助，目前全市已有农业中学五百五十处，平均每个公社有农业中学三点二处。各个单位还通过业余技术教育、短期训练、以师带徒、现场训练等多种方法，为农村培养了大批相当于中、初级水平的技术人材。全市的中等以上学校，在党的教育和劳动生产相结合、教育为生产服务的方针指导下，大办工厂、农场，也为农业生产制造出不少生产资料。仅南宫赵庄师范一校，就生产菌化肥二十四万斤，支援了农业。各级各类学校的师生，还在规定的劳动时间内，积极地参加农村各种劳动，半年来约计作出两千万个劳动日。科学研究部门，帮助十个县、区的公社和生产队，建立起一万六千个农业研究所、站、组，培训出五万七千七百名农民技术研究人员，为农业技术改造提供了一支新型的生力军。医疗卫生部门，围绕农业生产，及时组织医务人员深入田间、工地，参加生产和开展巡回医疗，保证了广大劳动群众和水利大军的健康。广大专业文艺工作者上山下乡为农民演出，并帮助各基层单位广泛开展业余文化活动，使农村文化生活出现了空前活跃的景象，大大提高了广大农民的社会主义觉悟，鼓舞了农民的生产热情。	从经济基础到上层建筑领域，	      发生了巨大的变化
    由于各行各业，特别是工业对农业的大力支援，使今年上半年的农业生产又夺取了新的巨大的胜利。首先，自去冬以来，即在全市范围内形成了一个全民性的大搞农田水利运动。全市除东风渠、民有渠的新建、扩建工程，和岳城、三歧水库的施工建设外，并完成了新建的百万方以上水库五座，小型水库一百四十六座，万亩以上灌区二十四处，小型渠道一万九千零六十八条，扬水站一百一十五座，打机井一千一百七十五眼，使全市水地面积扩大到一千三百七十万亩，占总耕地面积的71.5％。特别是今年3月份以后，在很久没落透雨的情况下，更加加快了水利建设的速度，同旱魔展开了苦战。不但胜利地完成了播种，获得了小麦丰收，而且在大田作物管理上，也取得了很大的成绩。其次，伴随着以农业为基础的国民经济的大发展，在耕作制度方面也发生了重大变革。现在全市已有占耕地总面积63％的土地，建成丰产方一万五千七百八十二个。在这些丰产方里，还建立了养猪场、化肥厂、修配厂。这种耕作制度的改革和农业八字宪法的进一步综合运用，为农业大量增产和农业的现代化创造了大好条件。与此同时，掀起了以提前实现粮食过黄河，棉花过长江为中心内容的农业丰产竞赛运动。这个运动正在轰轰烈烈和踏踏实实地向前发展。广大社员群众为在三、五年内根本改变邯郸市经济面貌的决心和信心更加坚定了。
    在贯彻执行以农业为基础的方针的过程中，使农村的政治、经济、文化、技术得到了全面发展，这不仅保证了农业生产的持续跃进，而且在上层建筑的领域里，也发生了巨大的变化。城乡之间、工农之间、领导和群众之间的关系更加亲密了。公社社员的共产主义觉悟大大地提高了。他们纷纷表示决心以夺取农业大丰收来感谢党的领导，感谢工人兄弟的无私支援。峰峰矿区临水公社的临水、大峪两个管理区，在矿务局和基建局的大力支援下，实现水利化以后，大大鼓舞了群众的生产积极性和共产主义的大协作精神，他们抽出六千个劳动力支援了峰峰管理区的抗旱斗争。巨鹿县的三个公社给邢家湾机械厂写了一百七十封感谢信。郊区郝庄生产队社员给工人送的赞词是：“往年修配到邯郸，今年修配到田间，感谢党的好领导，保证丰收万万年”。医疗部门在开展“四包”（包生产队、包丰产方、包户、包食堂）“五到门”（医疗到门、药品到门、看望到门、复诊到门、预防到门）运动以后，群众赞扬道：“新社会真是好，医生不请自来到，既看病又生产，真是毛主席领导的好医院”。广大社员在各行各业支援农业的鼓舞下，干劲冲天，一个群众性的规模壮阔的技术革命和技术革新运动，正在一日千里地发展着。	几点初步体会
    我们在贯彻执行以农业为基础的方针过程中，得到了如下几点的体会。
    第一、坚持政治挂帅，加强党的领导，反复讲解加快发展农业的重要意义，使全党全民进一步提高以农业为基础、首先抓农业的思想认识，提高支援农业的自觉性。在这一方面，我们特别加强了具体的思想领导。首先是在各级党组织的领导核心中，反复讲明厂社对口挂钩的重大意义和具体方法，然后大张旗鼓地向各个部门的全体党员、干部和职工群众进行了大力支援农业的思想教育。在开展支援农业的运动中，及时表扬了支援农业成绩卓著的先进单位和先进工作者，同时，批判了某些干部把支援农业看成是“额外负担”和“临时任务”以及把工业生产和支援农业对立起来的种种错误思想。由于广大干部对工农关系、城乡关系、以及农业和整个国民经济的关系有了正确的认识，支援农业的决心也就大大地增强了。在具体工作中，各个部门都建立了支援农业的专门组织机构，确定了专门的办事人员。这些机构在党委的统一领导下，对支援农业发挥了巨大的组织作用。
    第二、高速度地发展农业生产，当然需要有资金、材料，但当前最主要的任务还是要给农业安排足够的劳动力，并充分发挥每个劳动力的积极作用。因此，在农业生产的持续跃进中，我们除了及时供应农业所需要的资金和材料之外，还特别把对农业劳动力的安排，作为首要任务。最近市委根据上级党委的指示精神和本市的实际情况，规定了全年用于农业和牧业生产的劳动力要占农村全部劳动力的70％，在不同的季节，投到农业生产上的劳动力必须保持在80％以上。在冬春百日里，要继续贯彻执行河北省委规定的劳动力使用的三三制原则，即除了后勤劳动力外，用于田间管理积肥造肥的，用于林、渔、副业和社办工业以及短途运输的，用于水利等农田基本建设的劳动力，各占农村劳动力的三分之一左右。在农事特忙的季节，我们采取了抽组机关干部和集中农村劳力，以优势的兵力打歼灭战的办法，对农业生产进行了连续的大突击、大促进。事实证明，哪里认真这样做了，哪里的生产就发展得快。武安矿区大同公社丰里生产队就是一个生动的例子。这队共有二百四十户，二百九十个劳动力，耕地二千九百六十九亩。其中旱地二千八百七十四亩，占总耕地的96.8％，小麦占21％。在去冬今春二百多天没下过透雨的情况下，全队除整劳力经常保持满勤外，并有许多半劳力参加生产。经过全民奋战，不仅使全队小麦获得了大丰收，而且对于大秋作物的管理，也取得了很大成绩。
    第三、在贯彻执行以农业为基础方针的同时，在全市普遍推行了“二五制”的领导方法。各个领导机关的绝大多数干部都深入到了生产第一线，同社员同吃同住同劳动同商量；并有一定的时间进行集体研究和学习，使干部的思想理论水平和业务工作水平都大大提高，从而又进一步改进了工作作风，掌握了群众路线的工作方法，作到了从干中学，从学中帮，小问题就地解决，大问题及时解决。由于干部作风的进一步深入群众、深入生产，社员群众的干劲越来越大，生产效率越来越高。涉县县长王德恒同志深入管陶川，同社员一起挖泉找水进行劳动。社员们感动地说：“县长进了山，地水引出川，人畜有水吃，旱田变水田，怎么来报答，加油搞生产”。许多干部在参加劳动中，与群众交了知心朋友，使干部和群众的亲密关系得到了进一步的发展。
    第四、各行各业支援农业的主要内容，必须从各个季节农业生产最迫切的需要入手。我们围绕着加速农业技术改造，和促进农业持续跃进的总目标，对以下几方面的农事活动作了人力物力上的支援：抗旱保麦，抗旱春播，夏收夏种，秋田管理，和当前农业生产中迫切需要的农田水利建设工具，排灌机械，修配车床，小型发电站装备，化肥厂设备等。与此同时，我们及时帮助基层组织安排了劳力和群众生活。这种做法，很受群众欢迎。它的好处是，支援目标明确，切合农业生产的实际需要，可以收立竿见影的效果。
    目前，邯郸市各行各业支援农业的群众运动，在获得以上巨大成绩以后，正向纵深发展。但从整个情况来看，运动发展得还不够平衡，有些单位的工作还不能完全适应农业持续跃进的需要。对此，市委已在最近召开专门会议进行了研究，提出了新的措施。我们坚信，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，只要进一步发动各行各业的力量更加有力地支援农业，并进一步地发动各级干部和群众研究增产关键，大搞农业基本建设，加快农业技术改造，就一定能够夺取农业生产更全面的跃进，并进而促进整个国民经济建设的全面跃进。
