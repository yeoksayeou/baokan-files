    侗 People's Secretary Pan Tonghai	Our Correspondent in Guizhou
    In recent years, among the cadres and masses in Jianhe County, Guizhou Province, many stories about Pan Tonghai have been circulating: it is said that Pan Tonghai once built an oasis in the desert; it is said that a lazy and foolish mute, after Pan Tonghai's enlightenment, transformed into a hardworking and intelligent pig farmer; it is said that no matter how backward the work or how complex the situation in a region, as long as Pan Tonghai goes there, it will change... These legends show that due to the masses' boundless love and respect for Pan Tonghai, he is described as a legendary figure. In fact, he is an ordinary person, a Communist Party member of the 侗 ethnic group from a hired peasant background, who served as the leader of the mutual aid team in Fanhao Township's Ma Daying, the director of the cooperative, and the secretary of the management area's general branch. Now he serves as the Party Committee Secretary of the commune. In recent years, although Pan Tonghai's work position has been transferred many times, he has always maintained the fine style of hard work, plain living, and close ties with the masses. Recently, when Jianhe County selected "Five-Good Cadres," Pan Tonghai was rated as a model cadre for the entire county.
    In the area where Pan Tonghai works, few people see him walking empty-handed. Whether he goes to meetings or inspects production, he always carries a manure basket with him, picking up manure as he walks. He not only keeps his hands and shoulders busy while walking, but also his mind. He often inspects crops while walking, checking which field lacks fertilizer, which field has pests, which field has third-class seedlings, and whether there are any leaks in the canals. In March of this year, he went from the commune to a management area. To save time, he walked in the pouring rain. "Spring rain is as precious as oil," he greeted the spring rain with joy, like a crop seedling. In the rain, he walked and stopped, stopping and walking, checking the water situation in the fields as he went. He found that a section of the water trough had rotted due to disrepair and could not connect to the water, and several fields covering thirty mu were not receiving water. Spring rain is worth a thousand gold coins per moment; how could he let it flow away in vain? He immediately ran to the management area, called several management area cadres, took some wooden boards, and rushed to the opposite mountain. They widened the trough where it was narrow and patched it where it leaked, and only stopped working and went home when there were no leaks. Usually, Pan Tonghai also insists on participating in production. Last year alone, the production teams recorded one hundred and eighty-eight workdays for him.
    Comrades who work with Pan Tonghai all know that his quilt is often not on his bed during the day. He takes it wherever he goes, rests wherever he works, and always visits the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants. He not only relies on poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out various tasks and implement various policies, but also first understands the situation and conducts research through poor and lower-middle peasants. In March of this year, he took a work team to Peirong Team in Kangzong Management Area. At that time, the team's canteen was not run well, and the masses had opinions. On the night they arrived, they convened a meeting of more than fifty poor and lower-middle peasants, explaining the Party's current policies on production and life and listening to everyone's opinions. To thoroughly understand the problems existing in the team's canteen work, the comrades of the work team dispersed and lived in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants. Pan Tonghai himself carried his quilt to the home of poor peasant Long Taiguo. He and Long Taiguo slept in the same bed, starting with casual conversations, conducting political education for Long Taiguo, and explaining the Party's various policies. Long Taiguo's political consciousness improved, and he told Pan Tonghai everything about the problems existing in the team's production and canteen work. Combined with the information learned by other comrades, they thoroughly understood the canteen's situation. It turned out that a bad element was in charge of the canteen work, and the canteen cadre was a well-to-do middle peasant who, under the coercion and enticement of the bad element, embezzled thousands of kilograms of grain. After learning the true situation, Pan Tonghai then helped the team cadres seriously deal with these problems. In just half a month, the Peirong Team's canteen, along with production, nurseries, and homes for the elderly, were all transformed.
    Caring for the masses' suffering, caring for the masses' warmth, is a red line that runs through Pan Tonghai's entire work time and becomes increasingly鲜艳. The elderly here are like Pan Tonghai's own elders, and the children here are like his own children. He often takes time to visit the homes for the elderly and nurseries, asking the elderly about their food and accommodation, touching this child, and hugging that child. If it gets cold, he checks each child's clothes to see if they are thin. Once, when it suddenly turned cold and the nursery was not prepared, he found out and took out his own money to ask the childcare workers to buy some charcoal for the children to make a fire. Then he discussed with the management area cadres to use public welfare funds to add clothes for the children with thin clothing. He was only relieved until the third day when the children put on their new cotton clothes. He always takes extra care of households with few family laborers or other special difficulties. This spring, he came back from working on the slope and found that the fir bark on the roofs of Tan Laoqi's and Yang Laoqi's houses had been blown over by the wind. He thought: If it were other people's houses, it wouldn't matter much, but there were no young people in these two families, and it would be difficult if it rained. He walked and planned to find a few people from the team to help him repair it. However, he had just returned home when a strong wind blew up, and it looked like a heavy rain was about to come. Pan Tonghai immediately changed his mind, hurriedly picked up his cloak, put on his raincoat, and called Jiang Liangbai, Long Shaoyun, Luo Xingzheng, and other cadres, and went straight to Tan Laoqi's and Yang Laoqi's houses to work together. Before long, a heavy rain covering the mountains and ridges began to fall. Pan Tonghai and others persisted in this pouring rain until they had finished building the houses before they came down. Mother Tan stood at the door, looking at these cadres who were like relatives, her eyes filled with tears.
    Pan Tonghai attaches importance to ideological education work, but he never easily draws conclusions about a person's ideological problems. He always asks for the truth in everything and is good at adopting different methods of assistance according to different objects. In May of this year, at the Fanhao Production Team's canteen, he heard the members discussing Wu Baoyou, saying that Wu Baoyou pretended to be sick and did not go to work all day, and his wife quarreled with him because of this. He thought that Wu Baoyou was a young poor peasant member who had recently been an activist in production. Why did he suddenly become backward? That night, Pan Tonghai moved his luggage to Wu Baoyou's house and talked with Wu Baoyou in the same bed about family matters, national affairs, and socialist construction. Two days later, Wu Baoyou poured out all his thoughts to Pan Tonghai. It turned out that a cadre in their team had a quarrel with Wu Baoyou when arranging production once, and Wu Baoyou was deliberately angry with the cadre, saying he was sick even when he wasn't, and saying he was sick even when he wasn't. As a result of Wu Baoyou's actions, he not only aroused the dissatisfaction of the members, but even his wife had opinions about him, and the two quarreled as soon as they got home. Wu Baoyou almost cried as he said these things. Pan Tonghai lived with Wu Baoyou for six days, working together during the day and sleeping in the same bed at night. After Pan Tonghai's sincere and patient education and assistance, Wu Baoyou slowly became active, and the team cadre was also educated as a result. Correction

    侗族书记潘通海	本报驻贵州记者
    几年来，在贵州省剑河县的干部和群众中，传播着许多关于潘通海的故事：说潘通海曾在沙漠里建起绿洲；说有一个又懒又傻的哑吧，经过潘通海的开导，一变而成为又勤劳又聪明的养猪能手；说无论是工作多么后进，情况多么复杂的地区，只要潘通海一去，就会变样……。这些传说说明潘通海由于群众对他无限敬爱，他被说成一个传奇式的人物。其实他是个普通人，是个雇农出身的侗族共产党员，当过反皓乡马大营的互助组长、合作社主任、管理区总支书记，现在担任公社党委书记。几年来，潘通海的工作岗位，虽然调动了很多次，而他始终保持着艰苦朴素、密切联系群众的优良作风。最近，剑河县在评选五好干部时，潘通海被评为全县的干部标兵。
    在潘通海工作的地区，很少有人见他空手走过路。无论到哪里去开会，还是检查生产，他总是随身背着粪筐，一边走一边拾粪。他走路不但手不闲、肩不闲，而且心也不闲。他常常边走路边检查庄稼，看看哪块地缺肥，哪块地有虫害，哪块地出现三类苗，看看水渠有没有漏水的地方。今年3月间他从公社到一个管理区去，为了赶时间，在滂沱大雨中行走。“春雨贵似油”，他像庄稼苗一样欣喜地迎接着这场春雨。在雨中他走走停停，停停走走，一边走路一边检查田里受水情况。他发现有一段水槽因日久未修腐烂了，接不上水，有三十亩大的几块田没有流进水。春雨一刻值千金，怎么能让白白流走呢？他立刻跑到管理区，叫了几个管理区干部拿了些木板，急奔对面山上。他们见槽窄就掏，见槽漏就补，一直到无漏洞才收工回家。平常，潘通海也坚持参加生产。去年只是各生产队给他记的劳动日，就有一百八十八个。
    和潘通海一同工作的同志，都知道他的被子白天常常不在床上。他到哪里就带到哪里，在哪里工作就歇在哪里，而且他总是到贫农、下中农家里作客。他不仅依靠贫农、下中农进行各项工作，贯彻各项政策，而且首先通过贫农下中农掌握情况，进行调查研究工作。今年3月间，他带了一个工作组到康宗管理区的培荣小队。当时，这个小队的食堂办得不好，群众有意见。他们到这里的当天晚上，就召开了五十多个贫农、下中农参加的会议，向群众交待党的有关当前生产和生活的方针政策，并听取大家的意见。为了彻底了解这个小队食堂工作中存在的问题，工作组的同志都分散住到贫农、下中农家。潘通海自己背着被子到贫农龙太国家里去住。他和龙太国睡在一张床上，从谈家常入手，向龙太国进行政治教育，讲党的各项方针政策。龙太国的政治觉悟提高了，把小队生产和食堂工作中存在的问题，都一五一十地告诉潘通海。加上其他同志了解的情况，便摸透了食堂的底。原来把持食堂工作的是一个坏分子，食堂干部是个富裕中农，在坏分子的挟持和引诱之下，贪污粮食数千斤。了解到真实情况后，接着潘通海就帮助队干部认真处理了这些问题。只半个月时间，培荣小队的食堂连同生产、托儿所、敬老院，都变了样。
    关心群众疾苦，关心群众冷暖，是贯穿在潘通海整个工作时间里的一条愈来愈鲜艳的红线。这里的老人就像潘通海的老人，这里的小孩，也像是他自己的小孩。他经常抽空到敬老院和托儿所走走，问问老人们的食和宿，摸摸这个小孩，抱抱那个小孩。如果遇到天冷，他就挨个检查孩子们的衣服是否单薄。有一次天乍冷，托儿所没有准备，他发现以后，拿出自己的钱要保育员先给孩子们买些炭烤火。然后又与管理区的干部商量，用公益金给衣服单薄的孩子们添补衣服。一直到第三天孩子们把新棉衣穿到身上，他才放心。他对家庭劳动力少等有特别困难的户，总要多操一份心。今年春天他从坡上干活回来，发现谭老七和杨老七家的房顶上的杉树皮，被风吹卷翻了。他想：要是别家的还关系不大，这两家人的家里都没有年青人，一下起雨来可不好办。他一边走一边计划着到队上找几个人，帮助他修理一下。可是，他刚回到家里不久，就狂风大作，眼看大雨要来临了。潘通海马上改变了主意，匆匆拿起斗篷，披上蓑衣，喊上姜良白、龙绍云、罗兴正等几个干部，直奔谭老七和杨老七家的房子上，七手八脚地干起来。干不多久，铺山盖岭的大雨下起来了。潘通海等人就在这滂沱大雨中，一直坚持把房子盖好才下来。谭老妈妈站在门口，看着这几个像亲人一样的干部，眼眶里含满了热泪。
    潘通海重视思想教育工作，但决不轻易对一个人的思想问题下结论，凡事都问个究竟，并善于根据不同对象采取不同的帮助方式。今年5月间，他在反皓生产队食堂，听到社员们在议论吴保佑，说吴保佑整天装病不出工，他老婆因此和他吵嘴闹不和。他想吴保佑是个年青的贫农社员，不久前还是生产中的积极分子，为什么忽然变落后了。这天晚上，潘通海把行李搬到吴保佑家，和吴保佑睡在一张床上谈家常，谈国家大事，谈社会主义建设。两天以后，吴保佑把自己的心事全部倾诉给潘通海。原来是他们队上的一个干部，在一次安排生产时，和吴保佑闹了别扭，吴保佑有意气干部，有病也说病，无病也说病。吴保佑这样作的结果，不只引起了社员们的不满，连他老婆对他也有意见，一回家两人就吵嘴。吴保佑说着这些，几乎要哭起来。潘通海和吴保佑在一起生活了六天，白天一起劳动，晚间一张床睡觉。经过潘通海诚恳、耐心的教育和帮助，吴保佑慢慢地积极起来，那位小队干部也因此受到了一次教育。更　正
