    Steelworkers compete to increase production and conserve resources
    Yunnan steel enterprises compete to catch up with advanced groups and strive for high output
    Chengdu steelworkers challenge, respond, compete, help each other, and leap forward together
    Shijingshan Steel Plant overfulfills its steel, iron, and steel product production plans
    Baotou Steel No. 1 open-hearth furnace workers continuously set new records for rapid steelmaking
    Kunming, September 2nd (by our reporter) – Yunnan Province's steel front has achieved initial success in the increase production and conservation movement. Under the relatively difficult conditions of rainy season production, the average daily steel output continued to increase compared to July. The province has overfulfilled its August steel production plan by 2% one day ahead of schedule. The quality of steel has also continued to rise.
      Through discussions and the formulation of increase production and conservation plans, steelworkers in various enterprises have launched a new upsurge in production. Leading cadres at all levels of Kunming Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant, the main force in the province's steelmaking, went deep into the workshops and beside the furnaces to discuss plans with workers, grasp key points, and find measures. After discussing and formulating increase production and conservation plans, the second shift of the second steelmaking workshop first proposed a competition initiative to all major shifts in the plant, and all workshops and major shifts immediately responded enthusiastically. The workers competed with each other, and the competition was in full swing. As a result, the second steelmaking workshop completed its August production plan seven days ahead of schedule, and the plant's steel output increased by 11.46% compared to July, with a steel ingot acceptance rate of 94.37%. In the process of discussing increase production and conservation plans, the workers of Kunming No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant meticulously divided labor according to work posts and improved the post responsibility system; each group formulated specific measures around the completion of the increase production and conservation plans. The plant's workers launched a competition to learn from and catch up with advanced workers, with evaluations every five days. During the first evaluation of the steelmaking workshop, the second shift took the lead. The workers of the first shift worked hard to catch up, carefully studying the production organization experience and advanced operating methods of the other two shifts, and earnestly prepared for production, being rated as an advanced shift three times in a row. When the second shift fell behind, the workers humbly learned from the experience of other shifts and jumped from third place to second place. Through such mutual learning and common improvement, the plant completed its August steel production plan five days ahead of schedule, with a steel ingot acceptance rate of over 99%, and a reduction in pig iron consumption per ton of steel produced. "Small-scale indigenous" iron and steel enterprises distributed in various special districts and autonomous prefectures actively carried out technical training and equipment matching in the increase production and conservation movement, striving to improve the utilization coefficient of small converters, with an average daily production level in late August increasing by more than 27% compared to mid-August.
    Chengdu, September 2nd (by our reporter) – The steelworkers on the steel front of Chengdu launched a mass movement of comparing their energy, measures, output, and quality, promoting each other, chasing each other, pushing the steelmaking production to rise continuously.
    Encouraged by the great call of the Party Central Committee for carrying out the increase production and conservation movement, steel enterprises, workshops, and teams in Chengdu exchanged challenge letters, further pushing the steelmaking increase production movement to a new peak. The workers of the Chengdu Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant's steelmaking workshop, with great ambition, proposed "to be the first in the city in terms of output and quality," and challenged the first steelmaking workshop of Chengdu Iron and Steel Plant with this goal; the workers of Chengdu Steel immediately responded. The steel branch of Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, with smaller equipment capacity, also sent representatives to the Locomotive Plant to deliver a challenge letter, determined to surpass the steelmaking workshop of the Locomotive Plant in terms of high yield, high quality, and safety. In order to realize the conditions for inter-factory competition, the steelmaking enterprises carried out team-to-team and furnace-to-furnace competitions. In this way, the city's steel front formed a criss-crossing competition network, with furnaces guaranteeing teams and teams guaranteeing factories.
    In the competition, the advanced became even more advanced, and the backward quickly jumped into the ranks of the advanced. During the high-yield battles of August 15th and 16th, when the news came out that the steel output of the Chengdu Locomotive Plant's steelmaking workshop had jumped to the first place in the city, Chengdu Iron and Steel Plant immediately caught up, strengthening material yard management and equipment maintenance and repair. The steel output on the 17th and 18th jumped to the first place in the city. The steel branch of Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant specially drew production record charts of brother steel plants in the city, mobilizing the masses to always look up to the most advanced indicators. On August 15th, after learning that the Chengdu Locomotive Plant's steelmaking workshop electric furnace had created a record of smelting a furnace of steel in more than 50 minutes, the deputy director of the steelmaking workshop immediately rushed to the Locomotive Plant to "learn from experience" and creatively applied the advanced experience of the Locomotive Plant to the electric furnace of their own plant. The three electric furnaces achieved high yields in all aspects. From the 15th to the 19th, the plant's steel output exceeded the daily production plan assigned by the Municipal Party Committee by 44.3%, an increase of nearly four times compared to the average daily production level from the 1st to the 14th; the qualification rate of steel also increased.
    Under the common goal of guaranteeing the early and over-fulfillment of steel production tasks, the workers vigorously promoted the communist style of cooperation. The workers of the A, B, and C teams of the steelmaking workshop of the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant launched a team-to-team rival competition starting on August 15th. They not only pursued fiercely but also helped each other, creating high-yield conditions for other teams in every possible way. Workers on duty often do some auxiliary work for the next shift, helping to solve new problems that arise in production. Because they competed and helped each other, all three teams overfulfilled their production tasks every day.
    (By our reporter) The workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, who overfulfilled the state plan for the first seven months of this year, continued to leap forward in August, launching a new upsurge in production competition in the increase production and conservation movement. In August, the output of steel, iron, and steel products exceeded the state plan by 2.6%, 9.9%, and 21% respectively, the quality qualification rate reached over 98%, and the total output value and the improvement of labor productivity also exceeded the state plan.
    Entering August, the workers of the company fighting on various blast furnaces and converters checked indicators, calculated detailed accounts, found key points, formulated measures, and arranged the progress plan of production on a weekly, daily, and shift basis, launching a heated production competition. In order to supply the converters with sufficient molten iron, the workers of the pig iron furnace launched a competition of fast loading, fast pushing, and fast unloading, resulting in a large increase in molten iron. After receiving the good news, the steelworkers immediately launched a furnace-to-furnace and shift-to-shift competition around the key issues of shortening blowing time and extending furnace life, creating new daily production records three times in a row. The average daily output in late August increased by 22.7% compared to the upper and middle ten days, reaching the highest level since this year. Electric furnace workers vigorously carried out rapid steelmaking competition, greatly shortening the smelting time. Chen Liang's team of No. 1 electric furnace adopted the "pre-slagging" method, creating new records of rapid steelmaking twice in a row, shortening the smelting time of each furnace by ten minutes compared to the plan. The next shift of Li Hongwen's team, based on the adoption of the "pre-slagging" method, implemented reasonable charging, and the smelting time was shortened by twenty-six minutes compared to the plan. After hearing the news, Zhao Baozong, the leader of the nearby No. 2 electric furnace team, immediately went to the No. 1 electric furnace to learn, further improving the "yard material" operation and accelerating the melting speed. The smelting time was shortened by twenty-nine minutes compared to the plan, once again breaking the record for rapid steelmaking.
    Baotou, September 2nd (by Xinhua News Agency) – Workers of Baotou Iron and Steel Company have launched a new upsurge in the competition to increase production and conserve resources.
    The steelworkers first reported high-yield good news: The No. 1 open-hearth furnace, which was recently repaired according to the scheduled plan, has repeatedly created new records for rapid steelmaking due to the vigorous promotion of advanced experiences of more loading, fast smelting, high quality, and low consumption. The time for smelting a furnace of steel has been shortened from thirteen hours and fifteen minutes to twelve hours and forty minutes, and then from twelve hours and forty minutes to twelve hours and two minutes, and the steel grades meet the specified standards, and all steel ingots are qualified.
    The new record of shortening steelmaking time created by the steelworkers greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of all the steelworkers in the steelmaking plant. The workers of the ingot casting workshop put forward specific guarantees and measures for fast ingot casting and good ingot casting, indicating that they would work with the steelworkers to better strive for increased steel production. The workers of the transportation workshop put forward the slogan of "steady, accurate, fast, and safe" to ensure that the feeding is fast and good, and the molten iron is exchanged quickly and timely. The raw materials, equipment, and other workshops also put forward corresponding measures based on the requirements of rapid steelmaking. (Attached pictures)
