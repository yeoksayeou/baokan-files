New Developments in Farmers' Spare-time Education

　　Building Schools Based on Farms, Combining Labor and Education
    The establishment and development of new farming systems in high-yield farms have put forward new requirements and tasks for the high-speed development of farmers' spare-time education. First, because high-yield farms connect thousands of acres of land and implement unified planning, cultivation, and management, the organizational form of farmers' spare-time education must be changed accordingly to better adapt to production, facilitate production, and serve production. Second, the establishment of high-yield farms has opened up new avenues for accelerating the development of agricultural productivity, which has not only greatly encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the masses but also greatly encouraged their learning enthusiasm. To achieve large-scale high yields, the broad masses of farmers urgently require to quickly master the currently urgently needed agricultural machinery technology and scientific and cultural knowledge, and to prepare for the future comprehensive realization of mechanized technical operations. Third, high-yield farms are planted in a single way, and labor is specialized. The commune members who participate in different professional labor need to master different professional and technical knowledge, so it is necessary to quickly train professional talents and establish a technical team that is both red and expert. These are not only the problems that need to be solved urgently for the high-speed development of agricultural production but also the direction of farmers' spare-time education to serve production. Therefore, along with the changes in the relations of production, cultural education must also be revolutionized accordingly in order to better serve the economic base and promote the further development of productive forces.
    In view of the above situation and requirements, at the beginning of farm construction, the CPC Handan Municipal Committee timely proposed the policy of "building schools based on farms, combining labor and education" and "building farms and schools simultaneously," vigorously supported and led the work of running schools based on farms, thus quickly creating a mass movement in the city where farm construction and school construction were intertwined, so that every farm field established a red and expert school integrating politics, culture, and technology. Up to now, there are 5,116 schools run by farms in the city, including 1,299 run by single farms, 773 run by joint farms, and 3,044 run by a combination of farms and outside entities. More than 690,000 young and middle-aged people participate in the study of various types of schools run by farms, accounting for more than 79% of the labor force entering farms. The schools are roughly divided into the following types: One is the central red and expert school, which is directly led by the commune party committee, and the students are selected by the management areas. Its main tasks are: to conduct experiments, tackle cutting-edge technology, create high yields, play a demonstration role, and train technical backbones and management personnel for each production team. The second is the red and expert branch school, which is sponsored by the management area, and the students are selected by the high-yield farms in each management area. Its task is to cultivate new types of farmers with socialist consciousness, a certain level of cultural knowledge, and production skills. The third is the spare-time school combining farms and outside entities, which is sponsored by each production team. Under the guidance of the central red and expert school and the red and expert branch school, it organizes all commune members to participate in political, technical, and cultural learning, and continuously improves the socialist consciousness and cultural level of farmers, so that they can master general agricultural knowledge. The study time of these three levels of spare-time schools is flexibly controlled according to seasonal changes and the busy and slack seasons of farm work. Under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels, with the central red and expert school as the core, a broad network of farmers' spare-time education has been basically formed. As a result, farmers' spare-time education has not only been rapidly popularized but also improved; running schools on farms has become the main form of farmers' spare-time education. The broad masses of commune members are satisfied with this approach. They happily sang praises: "Farmers enter the farm, just like entering school; timely study politics, have a direction for progress; regularly study culture, wield a pen to write articles; greatly improve technology, high yield is guaranteed; encourage production, the farm field is like paradise."
　　Learning for Application, Promoting Production
    What are the benefits of running schools on farms? First, it guarantees the time for farmers' spare-time study and makes farmers' spare-time education regularized. The contradiction between farmers' spare-time study and participation in production labor has always existed. However, taking the method of running schools on farms to organize farmers' spare-time study can solve this problem more properly. Because the implementation of running schools on farms means that the commune members in the same farm are both laborers and students, which not only makes it easier to arrange their labor and study time but also allows them to study in the fields, so that the study time is increased compared with the past. Second, and more importantly, it makes farmers' learning more closely integrated with production and scientific research, so that farmers' spare-time education can better serve politics and production. Over the years, we have consistently emphasized that farmers' spare-time education must implement the combination of learning and production, the combination of politics, technology, and culture, but in the past, because learning was generally organized by production teams or villages, the production labor projects that each student engaged in each period could not be the same, so it was difficult to organize learning according to actual needs. After running schools on farms, it is possible to organize students to study current affairs and production technology or engage in certain scientific research according to the ideological situation of the students in the farm and the production needs in the farm. In this way, the high-yield farm is not only a base for commune members to engage in production labor but also a base for commune members to study and engage in scientific research. Third, it makes the combination of learning and application better. Since the things learned or researched are the problems existing in production, the results of learning and research can of course be immediately used to guide production practice, which is of great benefit to quickly improving the technical theoretical level of commune members. All of these show that running schools on farms can better implement the policy of combining labor and education, learning for application, and learning to serve politics and production in farmers' spare-time education.
    Over the past year, we have been doing this. Under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels, the red and expert schools have uniformly arranged the commune members' production, study, and rest time, so that study has been further guaranteed. Under normal circumstances, students work for no less than eight hours a day and study for two hours; during the busy farming season, some courses are arranged in combination with production operations as much as possible. This approach not only ensures that production is done well but also effectively overcomes the intermittent phenomenon that existed in spare-time study in the past, so that spare-time study can be carried out regularly, greatly accelerating the process of farmers' knowledge. In terms of learning content, it is based on the general line, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, and determined according to the long-term plans and current production plans of the high-yield farms. The primary and intermediate classes of each red and expert school have three subjects: politics, culture, and technology, and take the method of unified red, professional specialization, and separate classes for cultural learning. In terms of curriculum setting, each school generally allocates 15% to political courses, 55% to cultural courses, and 30% to technical courses. The duration of study for primary classes is about one and a half years, reaching the level of graduation from a spare-time primary school in culture, and being able to skillfully master one or two kinds of crop technical knowledge and mechanical technology in technology. The duration of study for intermediate classes is about two years, requiring the cultural level to reach the equivalent of secondary school graduation in major courses, and the technical level to reach the equivalent of graduation from a junior technical school or a secondary technical school in technology. Each school has adopted the method of teaching basic agricultural technical knowledge in the classroom according to the needs of the season and agricultural production, and then conducting field operations, so as to promote production with learning and promote learning with production. In order to better combine production and learning, general schools, especially central red and expert schools, have experimental fields (for scientific research project experiments), satellite fields (creating high-yield records), superior seed fields (cultivating and breeding superior varieties), and command fields (as models and playing a demonstration role), and have built greenhouses and simple weather stations for scientific research. For key research projects such as cotton and wheat, special groups are fixed to carry out operations and experiments, establish archives, regularly observe and record, accumulate data, and submit them to the technical research group for research and improvement, so as to guide the production of general fields.
    According to our understanding, since running schools on farms, through extensive and in-depth study of Comrade Mao Zedong's works, the political and ideological consciousness of the broad masses of commune members has been further improved, and the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and the communist moral qualities of going up to difficulties, giving way to honor, learning from the advanced, and helping the backward are increasingly becoming a new social trend. For example, Wang Sumei, a female red banner bearer of the "September 24" cotton high-yield farm in Cheng'an Commune, Cixian County, through party education and study in the red and expert school, not only actively led the cotton girls to compete for high yields but also actively helped her rival Gao Ruiqin to study measures to prevent cotton boll shedding. Many students have also gloriously joined the Communist Youth League or the Communist Party, or have been rated as red banner bearers in agricultural production after being cultivated by the party and studying and training in high-yield farms. In Cheng'an Commune, Cixian County alone, 140 students have joined the Communist Party, 320 young students have joined the Communist Youth League, and 350 students have become red banner bearers in agricultural production.
    The broad masses of students are not only pacesetters in production but also pioneers in attacking the fortresses of science and culture. Their characteristics are hard work, perseverance, learning and using at the same time, and rising step by step. Over the past year, among the commune members who have entered farms in the city, more than 210,000 have gotten rid of illiteracy and have entered the primary schools run by farms to study; another more than 220,000 have reached the level of graduation from senior primary school, and 2,200 have reached the level of graduation from junior high school, and have entered higher-level schools to study. The students in the primary schools have also learned 500 to 1,000 characters, reaching the degree of being able to write, recognize, and use them. According to incomplete statistics, the broad masses of students have written more than 350,000 poems and fast-clappers praising the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, praising the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. For example, Qin Aiqin, a female student of the "September 24" cotton high-yield farm, wrote a very good cotton harvest poem: "The cotton grows so rare, thousands of miles of silver waves cover Cheng'an, thousands of acres of cotton fields are like a green sea, and snow-white cotton is like a silver river, cotton white clouds are connected, and 'gods' can hardly distinguish between clouds and cotton."
    Because the political and ideological consciousness and cultural level of the commune members have been rapidly improved, because teaching has been closely combined with production, and the spirit of learning in use, using in learning, and learning for application has been implemented, the technical level of the students has been improved very quickly, creating more favorable conditions for the realization of agricultural technical transformation. Over the past year, under the combination of technical cadres, experienced farmers, and students, more than 11,500 tests have been carried out on more than 71,000 mu of high-yield crop experimental fields, including 4,800 tests on cotton and 6,711 tests on food crops, oil crops, and other crops. The test content involves soil and fertilizer, plant protection, grafting, staged irrigation, seed treatment, planting methods, crop density, and field management. Through these tests and studies, the laws of the sowing period, growth, development, and maturity of many kinds of crops in the local area have been clarified, and many methods for making crops high-yield have been found, accumulating a large amount of scientific data for improving cultivation techniques and cropping systems in the future. Huang Yuling, a farmer seed selector of the Jin'tan Town High-Yield Farm in Daming County, selected the "Zhengzhai No. 1" double-season corn, which was planted in early April this year and harvested for the first time on July 13. The students of the Linzhang High-Yield Farm in Cixian County, in scientific research activities, conducted 11 projects and 85 treatments on wheat, making the average yield per mu reach 1,180 jin, which is two times higher than the local wheat yield. Among them, the yield per mu of 10 mu of high-yield fields reached 2,062 jin. They also created the experience of winter sowing cotton and eliminating frost-affected flowers, and also made the winter sowing millet mature early, with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu. These have played a great demonstration role for general fields. The masses praised: "Learn technology, engage in high yield, the high-yield farm is our good model." More importantly, the spare-time schools have also trained a large number of talents. Among the 120 graduates of the Linzhang High-Yield Farm Central Red and Expert School in Cixian County last year, 42 served as technical cadres, 16 served as production team leaders, 28 served as accountants, and 34 served as spare-time teachers. More than 4,500 students in various high-yield farms in Daming County have mastered a complete set of cultivation techniques for fruit trees, cotton, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and so on. Eighty-two students of the Shuangwanmu Red Banner High-Yield Farm in Boyan Commune, Wu'an Mining Area, have learned the driving techniques of four types of tractors. More than 170,000 farmers in the city have reached the level of graduating from junior and senior agricultural technical schools. They can not only apply various technologies, especially professional technologies, in practice, but also raise them to the level of theoretical understanding.
　　Relying on the Masses, Running Schools Diligently and Frugally
    Running schools on farms is a new development in the mass movement of farmers' spare-time education. In the middle of running schools, we have always adhered to the policy of relying on the masses and running schools diligently and frugally, and solved various problems in accordance with the principle of simplicity and self-reliance. For example, the problem of school buildings is generally solved by using old houses and borrowing vacant houses. In places where housing is really lacking, students raise materials themselves or use old waste materials to build houses in their spare time. Desks, benches, teaching aids, etc., are solved by borrowing and teachers and students bringing their own. Teachers are solved according to the principle of "taking materials locally and taking the able as teachers." Political teachers are generally concurrently held by the deputy secretary of the commune party committee and the propaganda committee member of the production team party branch; cultural teachers are mainly the former people's school teachers of the production team, and appropriately absorb new forces; technical cadres are mainly technical cadres of the high-yield farm, and some experienced old farmers are hired to teach. Some schools have also established teaching and learning guarantee contracts with factories, tractor stations, agricultural machinery and tool repair factories, agricultural schools, and other units, and hire them to come to the farm to impart technology according to production needs. In order to cultivate and improve spare-time teachers, some places have also organized spare-time normal schools, absorbing teachers to participate in spare-time study. Some places have established teacher transmission stations, organizing teachers and counselors to regularly go to the station to receive transmission, observe teaching, learn from each other, and exchange experiences. Some places have established research groups with high-yield farms as units, preparing lessons together and improving each other. Shexian County has established a worker-peasant normal class attached to the ordinary normal school. Xingtai County has held a semi-farming and semi-study worker-peasant normal class. At the same time, the teachers of the spare-time schools eat, live, and work with the students, not only teaching the students scientific and cultural knowledge but also learning from the old farmers and the students in production. Many teachers have reflected: "The post is on the front line, teaching and practicing, after three years and five years, both civil and military are all-rounders."
    Although the farmers' spare-time education of running schools on farms in Handan area has achieved certain results under the correct leadership of the higher-level party committees, it still cannot adapt to the needs of the development of the situation. In the future, we must strengthen leadership over the work of running schools on farms according to the spirit of the instructions of the central government and the provincial party committee, as well as the municipal party committee's arrangements for the overall work, focusing on running agriculture in a big way and running food in a big way, and deeply developing the movement to increase production and save resources. In accordance with the spirit of both serving the current needs of agricultural production and planning for long-term goals, we will actively carry out teaching reform, improve teaching quality, and train various types of talents for agricultural production more, faster, and better. After the students of each central red and expert school reach the level of graduating from secondary technical schools, in addition to being used to enrich the technical backbone of agricultural production, a batch of excellent students should be appropriately selected for further study, so that they can reach the level of graduating from colleges and universities, so that in a few years, the communes, management areas, and production teams will have their own cultivated red and expert and multi-skilled peasant university students, becoming senior technical talents and backbone forces on the agricultural construction front. In order to achieve the above requirements, we must take collective training, station (red and expert school experience exchange station) discussion and research, and strengthen on-the-job advanced studies to improve the ideological level and business ability of the teaching staff. We must further cultivate learning activists among the students and constantly enrich the teaching staff. We must adapt to local conditions, teach students in accordance with their aptitude, establish a new school system that adapts to farmers' spare-time learning, and compile new teaching materials that meet the requirements.

    农民业余教育的新发展
　　中共河北省邯郸市委书记处书记　周基
　　以方建校　劳教结合
    农业丰产方新耕作制度的建立和发展，为高速度地发展农民业余教育提出了新的要求和新的任务。首先，由于丰产方连接了成千上万亩土地，进行统一规划、耕种和管理，农民作业在方田，因而农民业余教育的组织形式必须相应地进行改变，才能更好地适应生产，便利生产，服务生产。其次，由于丰产方的建立，为加速发展农业生产力开辟了新的途径，这就不仅极大地鼓舞了群众的劳动热情，而且大大地鼓舞了他们的学习热情。广大农民为了实现大面积的丰产，迫切要求迅速掌握当前急需的农业机械技术和科学、文化知识，并为将来全面地实现机械化的技术操作作好准备。第三，丰产方种植单一，劳动专业，参加不同专业劳动的社员，需要掌握不同的专业技术知识，因而必须迅速培养专业人材，建立起一支又红又专的技术队伍。这些既是高速度地发展农业生产所急需解决的问题，又是农民业余教育服务生产的方向问题。因此，伴随着生产关系的变革，文化教育也必须相应地进行革命，才能更好地为经济基础服务，推动生产力更进一步地发展。
    根据上述情况和要求，中共邯郸市委在建方之初，就及时地提出了“以方建校，劳教结合”和“建方建校同时并举”的方针，大力地支持和领导了以方办校的工作，从而迅速地在全市范围内出现了一个建方建校相互交织的群众运动，使块块方田都建立了政治、文化、技术三合一的红专学校。到现在，全市以方办校的有五千一百一十六处，其中一方单办的一千二百九十九处，联方办的七百七十三处，方内外结合办的三千零四十四处。参加方办各类学校学习的青壮年达六十九万多人，约占进方劳力的79％多。学校大体分为这样几种：一种是中心红专学校，由公社党委直接领导，学员由各管理区选送。它的主要任务是：搞试验，攻尖端，创高产，起示范作用，为各生产队培养技术骨干和管理人员。一种是红专分校，由管理区主办，学员由各管理区丰产方选送。它的任务是：培养有社会主义觉悟、有一定文化知识和生产技术的新型农民。一种是方内外相结合的业余学校，由各生产队主办，在中心红专学校和红专分校的指导下，组织全体社员参加政治、技术、文化学习，不断提高农民的社会主义觉悟和文化水平，使他们掌握一般的农业常识。这三级业余学校在学习时间上，是根据季节的变化和农活的忙闲，灵活掌握。在各级党委的统一领导下，以中心红专学校为核心，基本上形成了一个广泛的农民业余教育网。这样作的结果，农民业余教育不仅迅速地普及了，而且提高了；方田办学已经成为农民业余教育的主要形式。广大社员对这种作法是满意的。他们高兴地歌颂道：“农民进了方，如同进学堂；及时学政治，前进有方向；定期学文化，挥笔写文章；技术大提高，丰产有保障；鼓劲搞生产，方田赛天堂。”
　　学以致用，促进生产
    以方办校有些什么好处呢？首先，它保证了农民业余学习的时间，使农民业余教育走向经常化。农民业余学习和参加生产劳动的矛盾，这是历来存在的一个问题。而采取以方办校的方法来组织农民的业余学习，就比较妥善地解决了这个问题。因为实行以方办校，在同一个方内的社员，既是劳动者，又是学员，这就不仅更便于安排他们劳动和学习的时间，而且可以在地头学习，使学习的时间比过去增多了。其次，更重要的是使农民的学习同生产、同科学研究更紧密地结合起来，使农民业余教育更好地为政治为生产服务。历年来，我们一贯强调农民业余教育必须实行学习和生产相结合，政治、技术和文化相结合，但是过去由于学习一般是以生产队或以村为单位来组织的，每个学员每个时期从事的生产劳动项目不可能一样，因而很难做到根据实际需要来组织学习。而以方办校以后，就可以根据方内学员的思想情况，根据方内生产的需要，组织学员学习时事政治和生产技术，或者从事某种科学研究。这样，丰产方就既是社员从事生产劳动的基地，又是社员学习和搞科学研究的基地。第三，使学和用更好地结合起来。由于学习或研究的东西都是生产上存在的问题，学习和研究的成果，当然可以立即用于指导生产实践，这对于迅速提高社员的技术理论水平大有好处。所有这些都说明，以方办校能更好地在农民业余教育中贯彻劳教结合、学以致用、学习为政治为生产服务的方针。
    一年多来，我们正是这样作的。在各级党委的统一领导下，各红专学校都统一安排了社员的生产、学习和休息时间，使学习得到了进一步的保证。在一般情况下，学员每天劳动不少于八小时，学习两小时；在农忙的时候，有些课程便尽量地安排在生产操作中去结合进行。这样作，既保证了搞好生产，又有效地克服了过去业余学习中存在的时断时续现象，使业余学习能够经常进行，大大地加快了农民知识化的进程。在学习内容上，是以总路线为纲，以毛泽东思想为指导，根据丰产方的远景规划和当前生产计划来确定的。各红专学校的初级班和中级班，都设有政治、文化和技术三科，采取统一红、分业专、文化学习分开班的办法进行学习。在课程的设置上，各校一般是政治课占15％，文化课占55％，技术课占30％。初级班修业年限为一年半左右，在文化上达到业余小学毕业水平，技术上能够熟练掌握一至两种农作物技术知识和机械技术。中级班修业年限为二年左右，要求在主要课程上达到相当于中学毕业的文化水平，技术上达到相当于初级技术学校或中级技术学校毕业水平。各校都采取了根据季节和农业生产的需要，在课堂上讲授农业技术基本知识，然后进行田间操作的方法，以学习推动生产，以生产促进学习。为了使生产和学习更好地结合，一般学校特别是中心红专学校都设有试验田（作科学研究项目试验）、卫星田（创造高产纪录）、优种田（培育和繁殖优良品种）、指挥田
  （作样板，起示范作用），并建有温室和简易气象站，作科学研究之用。对棉花、小麦等重点研究项目，都固定专门小组进行操作试验，建立档案，定期观察记录，积累资料，交技术研究组研究提高，用以指导一般田的生产。
    据我们了解，自从以方办校以来，经过广泛深入地学习毛泽东同志的著作，广大社员的政治思想觉悟有了进一步的提高，敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格，见困难就上、见荣誉就让、见先进就学、见后进就帮的共产主义道德品质，正日益成为社会的新风尚。如磁县成安公社“九二四”棉花丰产方的女红旗手王素梅，经过党的教育和在红专学校学习，不但自己积极地领导棉花姑娘争夺高产，而且主动地帮助竞赛对手高瑞芹研究措施，制止棉花脱铃。还有不少学员经过党的培养和在丰产方学习、锻炼，已经光荣地参加了共青团或共产党，或者被评为农业生产上的红旗手。只磁县成安公社就有一百四十名学员参加了共产党，三百二十名青年学员参加了共青团，三百五十名学员成为农业生产上的红旗手。
    广大学员不仅在生产上是标兵，而且在学习上也是猛攻科学、文化堡垒的闯将。他们的特点是，刻苦钻研，见难猛进，边学边用，步步上升。一年多来，在全市进方的社员中间，已有二十一万多人摆脱了文盲状态，升入了方办初级学校学习；另有二十二万多人达到高小结业水平，二千二百多人达到初中结业水平，分别升入高一级的学校学习。初级学校的学员也都学会了五百至一千多个字，达到了会写、会认、会用的程度。据不完全统计，广大学员写的歌颂共产党和毛主席，歌颂总路线、大跃进、人民公社的诗歌和快板达三十五万余篇。如“九二四”棉花丰产方的女学员秦爱芹，就写了一首很好的棉花丰收诗：“棉花长的真稀罕，万里银波漫成安，千顷棉田如绿海，雪白棉花似银川，棉花白云连成片，‘神仙’难辨云和棉。”
    由于社员的政治思想觉悟和文化水平迅速提高，由于教学紧密地结合了生产，贯彻了学中用，用中学，学以致用的精神，学员的技术水平提高得很快，为实现农业技术改造创造了更为有利的条件。一年多来，在技术干部、老农和学员三结合下，在七万一千多亩农作物高产试验场地上，已经搞过试验一万一千五百多项次，其中棉花四千八百项次，粮食、油料等农作物六千七百一十一项次。试验内容涉及土肥、植保、嫁接、分期灌溉、种子处理、种植方法、作物密度和田间管理等许多方面。经过这些试验和研究，摸清了当地很多种农作物的播期、生长、发育和成熟的规律，找到了很多使农作物高产的方法，为今后改进耕作技术和耕作制度积累了大批科学资料。大名县金滩镇丰产方的农民选种家黄玉岭，选出的“郑寨一号”双季玉米，今年4月上旬播种，7月13日就第一次收获。磁县临漳丰产方的学员，在科学研究活动中，对小麦搞了十一个项目，八十五个处理，使小麦平均亩产达到了一千一百八十斤，比当地小麦产量高出两倍。其中十亩丰产田，亩产达到二千零六十二斤。他们还创造了冬播棉花，消灭霜后花的经验，并且使冬播谷子早熟，亩产达到一千多斤。这些对一般田都起了很大的示范作用。群众称赞道：“学技术，搞高产，丰产方是咱们的好样板。”更重要的是，各业余学校还培养了大量的人材。磁县临漳丰产方中心红专学校，去年毕业的一百二十人中，就有四十二人担任了技术干部，十六人担任了生产队长，二十八人担任了会计，三十四人担任了业余教师。大名县各丰产方已有四千五百多名学员，掌握了果树、棉花、花生、红薯等一整套培植技术。武安矿区伯延公社双万亩红旗丰产方的八十二名学员，学会了四种拖拉机的驾驶技术。全市已有十七万多农民，分别达到了初级和中级农业技术学校毕业的水平。他们对各种技术，特别是对专业技术，不仅能在实践中运用，而且还能提高到理论上去认识。
　　依靠群众　勤俭办学
    以方办校是农民业余教育的群众运动的新发展，我们在办学的中间始终坚持了依靠群众、勤俭办学的方针，对各种问题都本着因陋就简、自力更生的原则加以解决。比如校舍问题，一般都是利用旧房和借用空闲民房。有的地方的房舍实在缺乏，学员们就自筹物料或利用旧废物料，用业余时间兴建房屋。桌凳、教具等，是采取借用和教师、学员自带等办法解决的。教师是根据“就地取材，能者为师”的原则解决的。政治教师一般都是公社党委副书记和生产队党支部宣传委员兼任；文化教师以原来生产队的民校教师为主，适当吸收新生力量；技术干部以丰产方的技术干部为主，并聘请了部分有经验的老农任课。有的学校还与工厂、拖拉机站、农机农具修配厂、农业学校等单位建立了保教、保学合同，根据生产需要，聘请他们到方传授技术。为了培养、提高业余教师，有的地方还组织了业余师范，吸收教师参加业余学习。有的地方建立了教师传授站，组织教师和辅导员，定期到站接受传授，观摩教学，互相学习，交流经验。有的地方以丰产方为单位，建立了研究小组，共同备课，互相提高。涉县在普通师范附设了工农师范班。邢台县举办了半耕半读工农师范班。同时，业余学校的教员，都同学员同吃同住同劳动，既向学员传授科学、文化知识，又在生产中向老农向学员学习。许多教师都反映：“岗位就在第一线，既教学又实践，过上三年并五载，能文能武样样全。”
    邯郸地区以方办校的农民业余教育，在上级党委的正确领导下，虽然获得了一定的成绩，但还不能适应形势发展的需要。今后，我们要根据中央和省委的指示精神，以及市委对整个工作的安排，围绕大办农业，大办粮食，深入开展增产节约运动，对以方办校的工作加强领导。根据既服务于当前农业生产需要，又为长远目标打算的精神，积极进行教学改革，提高教学质量，更多、更快、更好地为农业生产培养各类人材。各中心红专学校的学员达到中等技术学校毕业水平后，除用以充实农业生产技术骨干外，要适当选一批优秀学员继续深造，使他们达到大专学校毕业程度，以便在几年内使公社、管理区、生产队都有自己培养出来的又红又专和一专多能的农民大学生，成为农业建设战线上的高级技术人材和骨干力量。为了达到上述要求，要采取集体培养训练，分站（红专学校经验交流站）讨论研究和加强在职进修等办法，提高教师队伍的思想水平和业务能力。要在学员中进一步培养学习积极分子，不断地充实师资力量。要因地制宜、因材施教，建立起一套适应农民业余学习的新学制，编写出适合要求的新教材。
