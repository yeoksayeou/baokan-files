    Inspector Zhao, the Field Supervisor, Liaoning Fengcheng Li Hongbi
    "Attention! Inspector Zhao is coming!"
    In the lush green rice paddies, we young shock brigade members were weeding, chatting, and laughing when Xiao Chen suddenly gave everyone a warning. Instantly, the noisy rice paddy became quiet, with only the rustling sound of everyone weeding.
    I looked up and, sure enough, Inspector Zhao was heading straight for the rice paddy with his cattle whip in hand.
    Actually, Inspector Zhao wasn't a real director, but everyone nicknamed him that because he was always inspecting other people's work in the fields. But you could only say it behind his back, not to his face.
    He was originally the grazing keeper of our production team, with a clear task: grazing the cattle. However, he meddled in more things than the team leader! Every day after breakfast, he drove the cattle to the riverbank, got them settled, and then ran to the fields, helping everyone with their work while inspecting everyone's efforts. If he found that you were doing a sloppy job, then watch out, he would criticize you to your face until your ears turned red, and then he would help you correct it. To be honest, everyone respected him, but was also a little afraid of him; you couldn't get away with doing anything wrong in front of him! This time, he came to us, no doubt to find fault again. Well, let him try, it would be difficult to find any fault with our shock brigade.
    Inspector Zhao walked to the edge of the field, looked at everyone, and didn't say a word. Seeing him standing still, Xiao Liu straightened up and said, "Uncle Zhao, aren't you afraid the old cows will run away if you come here?"
    "How could they?" Inspector Zhao said, "My herd of old cows are well-trained and very disciplined, where would they run to?" Everyone laughed at this.
    "What are you laughing at!" Inspector Zhao said in his usual serious tone, "You young lads shouldn't just giggle and laugh while working, pay attention to quality!"
    "Guaranteed!" Xiao Liu said unconvinced, "You check, if you find a single weed missed, I'll eat it!"
    When Xiao Liu said this, Inspector Zhao really started checking. While taking off his shoes, he glared at Xiao Liu and said, "You're young, but you've got a big mouth!"
    Inspector Zhao stepped into the paddy field and headed straight for Xiao Liu's area. He looked like he was searching for a needle, checking here and looking there, but he didn't find a single weed missed. He was satisfied and said with a smile, "Hey, this stubborn lad is really something, if everyone worked like this, would we still be afraid of a small grain harvest?"
    Xiao Liu smiled smugly: "How about it? Couldn't find any faults, right?"
    Inspector Zhao suddenly stopped smiling and said, "You're getting complacent! It's good, but you can't be arrogant!" Xiao Liu shrank his neck and dared not say anything.
    Inspector Zhao finished checking the area that Xiao Liu had weeded. Everyone thought he would leave now, right? Actually, he wouldn't let anyone off the hook. He started checking everyone one by one. When he walked to his son Haiyun's area, he suddenly stopped. At this moment, his face darkened and his mustache bristled.
    "What's going on here?" Inspector Zhao pointed to several rice seedlings roots and said angrily, "Why aren't the weeds in the seedling eyes weeded clean? Who are you fooling? Huh?"
    Haiyun was so frightened that his face turned red. He knew his father's temper, no matter who did something wrong, he would never let them off easily. Haiyun thought, now that it's happened to me, he definitely won't let me off lightly! So, he carefully turned around and weeded the few weeds clean.
    "Let me tell you, you can't work like this!" Inspector Zhao's anger hadn't subsided. Seeing this, Xiao Liu came over to plead for him: "Hey, Uncle Zhao, even when eating, there are times when you drop a grain of rice, why get so worked up!"
    Who would have thought that this sentence would make Inspector Zhao even angrier. He said, "What kind of talk is that! When working on the farm, there can't be any carelessness! Do you think weeding a lot and weeding fast is all that matters? It also has to be done well." As he spoke, he looked at everyone, as if asking, "Do you all understand?"
    Xiao Liu stuck out his tongue and quickly nodded: "Makes sense, makes sense." He didn't dare to chime in casually anymore. At this moment, Inspector Zhao chuckled and started weeding with everyone. Seeing that the old man was weeding quickly and well, everyone secretly geared up and competed with him.
    After working for a while, Inspector Zhao took his whip and left silently. Seeing that Inspector Zhao's shoes were still at the edge of the rice paddy, everyone said in unison, "He went to water the cattle, he'll be back in a while."

    查田主任	辽宁凤城李鸿璧
    “注意，查田主任来喽！”
    在绿油油的稻田里，我们青年突击队的几个小伙子，一边拔草，一边说笑，小陈忽然向大家发出了警报。于是，喧闹的稻田，顿时变得肃静起来，只听见大家拔草的唰唰声。
    我抬头一看，可不是，查田主任手里拿着放牛鞭子，直奔稻田来了。
    其实，查田主任并不是什么真正的主任，而是大伙看他成天总在地里查人家的活计，才给他起了这个绰号。但是，只能背后讲，不能当面叫。
    他本来是咱们生产队的放牧员，任务很明确：放牛。可是，他管的事比队长还宽哩！每天吃过早饭，他把牛赶到河边，弄顺当了，就跑到地里，一边帮大家干活，一边查大家伙的活。若是查出你干活粗糙，那你瞧吧，他准当面把你批评得耳红脖赤，然后，他又帮助你纠正过来。说实在的，大伙尊敬他，也真有点怕他；在他面前作得错事，休想！这回，他找上门来，不用问，准是又来挑毛病了。挑吧，反正在我们突击队是难以找出毛病的。
    查田主任走到田边，瞅着大家，一声不吱。小刘看他不动弹，就直起腰说：“赵大叔，你到这里来，不怕老牛都跑啦？”
    “怎能？”查田主任说：“我那群老牛都是经过训练的，非常守纪律，往哪跑？”这一说，大家都笑了起来。
    “笑什么！”查田主任照例一本正经地说：“我说你们这些小伙子，干活别光嘻嘻哈哈的，要注意质量！”
    “保险！”小刘不服气地说，“你查吧，查出来漏掉一棵草，我吃了！”
    小刘这么一说，查田主任真的要查了。他一边脱着鞋，一边瞪着小刘说：“年轻轻的，口气倒不小！”
    查田主任走下水田，直奔小刘身后。他像寻针似的，这瞅瞅，那看看，没有发现漏掉一棵草，他满意了，笑着说：“嘿，这楞小伙倒真有两下子，都照这么干法，还怕粮食打的少吗？”
    小刘得意地笑了笑：“怎样？没找到毛病吧？”
    查田主任忽然收起笑容，说：“说你胖，你还添喘了呢！好是好，
      可不兴你骄傲！”小刘缩缩脖，不敢吱声了。
    查田主任查完了小刘拔的那块，大伙寻思他该走了吧？其实，他不会放过任何一个人的。他开始挨个地查起来。当他走到他的儿子海云那里，忽然站住了。这时，他的脸色阴下来，胡子翘起来了。
    “这是怎么搞的？”查田主任指着几棵稻苗根，怒气冲冲地说：“苗眼草为什么不拔净？糊弄谁？啊？”
    海云吓得脸红了。他知道爸爸的脾气，不管谁作错了事，他总是不肯轻饶的。海云想，这回临到自己头上，更不能轻饶！于是，他小心翼翼地转过身来，把几棵草拔净了。
    “告诉你，这样干活不行！”查田主任气还未消。小刘看到这种情形，就凑上来讲情：“嗨，赵大叔，吃饭还有掉饭粒的时候呢，干嘛动这么大的肝火！”
    谁料想，这句话倒惹得查田主任更来气了。他说：“这叫什么话！干庄稼活，不兴有半点马虎！你寻思拔得多、拔得快就算啦？还得好才行。”他说着，又瞅瞅大家，好像在问：“你们都明白吗？”
    小刘伸伸舌头，连忙点头：“有道理，有道理。”再不敢随便搭腔了。这时，查田主任“嘿嘿”一笑，开始和大家一起拔起草来。大伙看这个老头拔得又快又好，也都暗暗地较上了劲，和他赛起来。
    干了一气活的时候，查田主任拿着鞭子，走了，而且不声不响。大伙看查田主任那双鞋还在稻田边，都不约而同地说：“他去饮牛了，一会还能来。”
