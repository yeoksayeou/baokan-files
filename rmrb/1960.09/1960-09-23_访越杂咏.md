　　Miscellaneous Poems on a Visit to Vietnam
        Zhao Puchu
　  Singing with drunken joy, wearing red shoes
    [Attending the Vietnamese National Day Song and Dance Evening] Looking at the light boats on the lotus-picking waves, marveling at the butterflies playing before the wind and the weeping willows, listening to the sounds of ice strings, jade pipes, and the smooth throats, I ask, when has such joy ever existed? Another song ascends the stage as hands wave (note), seeing the figures of today's heroes, competing to cheer and wish brotherhood for thousands of years, holding up the sky and claiming longevity together, sharpening our resolve to face common enemies, the light of the lamps before the tent shines brightly.
  (Note) Before the end of the meeting, President Ho Chi Minh personally conducted the singing of "Unity is Strength".
　  Bac Bo Cave
　　Living in a cave in the wilderness, concerned with the affairs of the world, using firewood, courage, a bamboo basket of rice, and a gourd to illuminate the world. Winning Bac Bo as a long-term companion, Lenin Stream, Marx and Engels Mountain.
　 ?Bac Bo Cave is located in a mountain in northern Vietnam, where President Ho Chi Minh lived in the cave for more than four years. The Hanoi Revolutionary Museum displays a model of the cave and the utensils used by President Ho Chi Minh in those years.
　 ?When President Ho Chi Minh lived in the cave, he named the mountain where he lived Marx and Engels Mountain, and there was a stream in front of the cave, which he named Lenin Stream.
　  Linjiang Xian
　　[The Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace invited us to tour Ha Long Bay, and among those traveling with us were friends from Japan and Africa.] Everywhere, strange peaks rise to greet us, endless layers of mountains and peaks, green waves flow away and then circle back. The sea is a sea within the mountains, the mountains are mountains within the sea. Glad to see the East Wind is now in charge, guests and friends from different countries rejoice together. Holding hands as if in a dream, facing the wonders. Waiting to invite the world, to appreciate Ha Long Bay together.

　　访越杂咏
        赵朴初
　  醉高歌带朱履曲
    〔参加越南国庆歌舞晚会〕望采莲波上轻舟，惊戏蝶风前垂柳，听冰弦玉管珠喉溜，问此乐几时曾有？又一曲登台挥手（注），看今朝人物风流，争欢呼兄弟祝千秋，擎天称共寿，磨厉赴同仇，帐前灯，光射斗。
  （注）会终前，胡志明主席亲自指挥唱《团结就是力量》。
　  北波洞?穴居野处关天下，薪胆箪瓢照世间。赢得北波长作伴，列宁溪水马恩山。?
　 ?北波洞在越北某山，胡志明主席曾住洞中四年余。河内革命博物院陈列山洞模型及胡主席当年用具。
　 ?胡志明主席洞居时，名所居之山曰马恩山，洞前有溪，名之曰列宁溪。
　  临江仙
　　〔越南保卫世界和平委员会邀游下龙湾，同游者有日本及非洲友人。〕处处奇峰迎面起，无穷叠巘层峦，碧波流去又回环。海为山里海，山是海中山。喜见东风今作主，宾朋异国同欢。相携如梦对奇观。待看邀世界，共赏下龙湾。
