At the first day of the National Track and Field Championships, Shandong athlete Tian Zhaozhong won prolonged and enthusiastic applause and praise from the audience for achieving a world-class result of 16.35 meters in the men's triple jump final.

Tian Zhaozhong is 23 years old and 1.87 meters tall. In April 1955, when he participated in a national track and field competition in Shanghai for the first time, he only ranked fourth in the triple jump with a score of 13.52 meters. However, two years later, in July 1957, his score jumped to 15.18 meters, making him the first athlete in China to reach the standard of a track and field athlete (15 meters) in the triple jump. Since then, he has maintained the title of "National Record Holder," and his scores have improved every year. In 1958, his score was 15.65 meters; in 1959, it was 15.82 meters. This year, his score continues to improve, reaching 16 meters on August 20th; this time, he has become the first triple jumper in China to break the 16-meter "barrier."

Tian Zhaozhong's continuous improvement in performance is inseparable from his long-term adherence to comprehensive training. He can run 100 meters in about 11 seconds and achieve a long jump score of more than 7 meters. Based on the fact that he broke the national record in all four of his trial jumps in this competition, he still has great potential to improve his scores.

In the women's high jump final of the National Track and Field Championships, Wu Fushan, a 17-year-old high jump newcomer from Beijing, attracted great attention. She seriously threatened Zheng Fengrong, the former world record holder and Shandong athlete, for the first time in three years. How high Zheng Fengrong jumped that day, she jumped that high too, and finally her score was equal to Zheng Fengrong's, both jumping over 1.70 meters. She only won the second place because of more missed attempts.

The young Wu Fushan only started practicing high jump in 1958. In 1959, when she was 16 years old, her high jump score jumped from 1.40 meters to 1.60 meters, reaching the standard of a track and field athlete.

In February of this year, after Wu Fushan was honorably selected as a representative to attend the Beijing Municipal Congress of Heroes, it further encouraged her confidence in improving her performance. At the end of February, she jumped over 1.61 meters; in mid-May, she jumped over 1.66 meters, becoming the third female athlete in China to jump the highest. In August, her high jump score improved to 1.67 meters. Recently, she finally jumped over 1.70 meters three times in a row, becoming the second female athlete in China to jump the highest. 1.70 meters, this height has exceeded her height by two centimeters.

    全国田径运动会上的老将新手
    在全国田径运动会的第一天，山东选手田兆钟在男子三级跳远决赛中，创造了十六米三十五的达到世界水平的成绩，博得了观众长时间的热烈掌声和赞扬。
    田兆钟今年二十三岁，身高一米八十七，1955年4月他在上海第一次参加全国性田径比赛时，只以十三米五十二的成绩名列三级跳远第四。但两年以后，在1957年7月，他的成绩就跃进到十五米十八，成为我国第一个达到三级跳远运动健将标准（十五米）的选手。以后，他一直保持着“全国纪录保持者”的称号，而且成绩每年都在提高。1958年，他的成绩是十五米六五；1959年是十五米八二。今年，他的成绩仍在跃进，8月20日达到了十六米；这次又成为我国第一个突破十六米“大关”的三级跳远选手。
    田兆钟成绩的不断提高，是和他长期坚持全面锻炼分不开的。他能用十一秒左右的时间跑完一百米，跳远成绩达到七米以上。根据他在这次比赛中四次试跳都打破全国纪录的情况看，他还有很大潜力来提高自己的成绩。
    在全国田径运动会的女子跳高决赛中，北京十七岁的跳高新手吴浮山引起人们极大的注意，她使前世界纪录保持者、山东选手郑凤荣三年来在国内第一次受到了严重威胁。郑凤荣这天跳多高，她也跳多高，最后同郑凤荣的成绩相等，都跳过一米七十，她仅仅因为失误次数多，才获得亚军。
    年轻的吴浮山从1958年才开始练习跳高。1959年当她十六岁时，她的跳高成绩就由一米四十跃进到一米六十，达到了运动健将标准。
    今年2月，吴浮山被光荣地选为出席北京市群英会的代表后，更鼓舞了她提高成绩的信心，2月底她就跳过了一米六十一；5月中又跳过一米六十六，成为我国第三个跳得最高的女运动员。8月，她的跳高成绩提高到一米六十七。最近，她终于连续三次跳过一米七十，成为我国第二个跳得最高的女运动员。一米七十，这个高度已经超过她身高两厘米了。
