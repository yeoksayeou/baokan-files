　　“Borrowing from Heaven and Earth” – A Riot of Color
　　——On the Achievements of Guli Commune in Expanding the Cultivation of Melons, Vegetables, and Coarse Grains by Utilizing "Ten-Edge" Marginal Land
　　Our Newspaper Reporters: Sun Zhen, Bao Chunguang, Gu Ping

　　The autumn in Jiangnan is extremely appealing: Dongting honey oranges make mouths water, the ears of middle-season rice cling closely to the ground, and the late-season rice waves like emerald seas, carrying a fragrant scent. When we arrived at the Guli People's Commune in Changshu County, Jiangsu, we were even more captivated by the new and extraordinary scenery. By the roadside, poplar leaves were falling, and sunflowers were blooming; on the banks of the fields, sorghum stood in formation, and soybeans climbed in vines; along the riverbanks, pumpkins had just been harvested, and rows of cabbages and radishes stretched along the riverbanks; in the villages, all sorts of melon and bean vines formed green corridors, green arbors, green arches, and even green walls and roofs...

　　How significant is the full utilization of "ten-edge" marginal land? We only gained a new understanding of this after we arrived at Guli Commune.

　　The area used by Guli Commune for planting crops on "ten-edge" marginal land is approximately 7,400 mu, which is equivalent to more than 15% of the commune's cultivated land. This year, these marginal lands have already yielded more than 4.5 million jin of pumpkins, more than 1.5 million jin of various vegetables, and more than 300,000 jin of beans and coarse grains. If these products were to be transported out, they could fill more than one hundred train cars!

　　Guli Commune is located in a low-lying area with crisscrossing rivers and ditches. The "Gu" in Guli was originally the "Gu" in "Guyu" (fishing net), indicating that many years ago, this was a fishing village. The farmers who grew up here had never planted vegetables or coarse grains for generations. Some commune members had eaten watermelons and cantaloupes, but had never seen what the vines looked like. Only after the establishment of the commune did they begin to plant vegetables here, but it was not enough to meet the needs of the commune members. Last year, the commune purchased more than 100,000 yuan worth of melons and vegetables from other places. This year, the melons and vegetables planted by the commune can not only meet their own needs, but also sell a portion, bringing in a cash income of more than 68,000 yuan.

　　We had lunch at the cafeteria of the seventh team of the first brigade. On this day, the commune members were eating boiled edamame with salt water and stir-fried vegetables. After we arrived, the cook casually picked a large loofah from the melon shed in front of the house and shelled a lot of edamame, adding two more dishes for us. In a short while, the cook happily brought four large bowls of fresh and tender green vegetables to the table, and said, "Please try them, these are all grown on the 'ten-edge' land."

　　In the past, people believed that this area was low-lying, and that besides planting rice, there was no good land for planting melons, vegetables, and coarse grains. After the autumn harvest last year, the commune party committee planned to sow 200,000 jin of broad bean seeds on the "ten-edge" marginal land. Initially, very few people believed that this plan could be realized. The cadres of the grain management office only transported back 20,000 jin of broad bean seeds from the county, and they wondered: if all 200,000 jin of broad bean seeds were transported back, where would they be planted?

　　One cloudy morning, the secretary of the commune party committee and some production team cadres took a small boat to the bottom of a steep slope where even a person could not stand. They squatted on the boat, one using a shovel to dig pits on the steep slope, and the other dropping and covering the seeds. Starting from one foot above the water surface, all five-inch square plots were planted with broad beans. The next day, a site meeting attended by cadres above the level of small team leader was held. After everyone saw it, they believed that if they worked this way, there would be more land that could be utilized. The comrades of the grain management office then successively transported back more than 100,000 jin of broad bean seeds. This spring, the party committee made a great effort to plant melons, vegetables, and coarse grains on the "ten-edge" marginal land. Some cadres and commune members said that there was no land left. The commune party committee once again set an example: the party committee secretary and the cadres of the eleven brigades cleared nearly a hundred dan of rubble and garbage from a tile yard where houses had been burned down by the Japanese devils, and planted melons and vegetables. At this time, the cadres and commune members of each production team not only followed the example, but also came up with ideas and used their brains, resulting in a climax of finding gaps and making full use of the "ten-edge" marginal land.

　　On both sides of a highway that runs through the entire commune, the poplar trees have already shed their leaves, and waxy yellow flower rings are still blooming on the sunflower stalks. On the slopes of the highway, the early beans have already been harvested, and the late beans are also bearing many pods. The part of the highway slope close to the water surface is also full of green vegetables. On the ridges around the rice fields, bean vines stretch like dragons, and reed stalks and sorghum grow in rows. Along the crisscrossing large and small rivers, and in the gaps in front of and behind the houses, there are green vegetables and radishes everywhere. Before planting green vegetables and radishes, these places were all planted with pumpkins and soybeans. The commune members said: at that time, if you weren't careful when walking, you would kick a big pumpkin every three or five steps. Walking through the large and small villages here, everywhere is like a garden. Many commune members used bamboo branches and straw ropes to build flower stands on the eaves of their houses, and led melon and bean vines up, truly like a long gallery. In front of many commune members' houses, bamboo frames like marquees were covered with golden loofah flowers and butterfly-like purple hyacinth bean flowers. In the open spaces and courtyards in front of the houses, they were covered with dense melon and bean vines, becoming flower-filled arbors. Some commune members also led vine crops onto the walls, which were even more beautiful than the green walls covered with "ivy" that are commonly seen.

　　When we first arrived in Guli town, we saw that the green arches, galleries, and green walls of every household were connected into one long dragon after another, and we couldn't even find the gate of the commune. We looked closely and found that the sign of the commune party committee was hidden in the dense loofah vines. Walking into the courtyard, the sunlight sprinkled on us in dots through the melon shed. As we walked and looked around, we almost bumped into the large loofah hanging down from the melon shed.

　　In places without soil, such as streets and brickyards, people made grass nests with a diameter of two feet and a height of more than one and a half feet, filled them with soil, planted pumpkins and hyacinth beans, and led the vines onto the roofs and trees. They called these methods of fully utilizing space and transplanting soil for planting "borrowing from heaven and earth." The area utilized by the whole commune in this way is equivalent to having more than 1,000 mu of land out of thin air, opening up a riot of color in a new world.

　　Is Guli Commune paying so much attention to fully utilizing the "ten-edge" marginal land because it does not have enough cultivated land or because its grain yield is not high? No. After several years of continuous Great Leap Forward, people's minds have been liberated, and their horizons have been broadened. They not only see the affairs of their own commune, but also closely link their own commune with the country as a whole, and not only see the immediate interests, but also see the upcoming prospects.

　　Guli Commune is a commune in a high-yield area in Jiangnan. The secretary of the commune party committee told us that the whole commune has more than 48,000 mu of cultivated land, with an average of 2.3 mu per person. The average grain yield of rice and wheat two crops is 1,400 jin per person. Last year, the whole commune turned over to the state more than 21 million jin of public grain and sold surplus grain. Their full utilization of "ten-edge" marginal land is for surplus grain areas to have more surplus grain, and to support the country's socialist construction. We met more than a dozen women who were sowing radishes on a tractor road. This tractor road was built this spring in conjunction with water conservancy construction. The women planted almost all the radishes on the tractor road, leaving only a one-foot-wide walkway, and they will soon interplant barley and broad beans. They said: the more we plant now, the more we harvest, and the faster the tractor will come.

　　Guli Commune has established a line of leadership from top to bottom. In their words, the commune party committee has "ten-edge" secretaries, the production brigades and teams have "ten-edge" captains, and each production team has three or four "ten-edge" managers, who are all experienced elderly commune members. During the concentrated rush planting, the whole people mobilize for two or three days, and usually the managers are responsible for professional management. These days, the commune members are sowing vegetables, radishes, and overwintering crops on the "ten-edge" marginal land. The sowing area has increased from more than 7,000 mu to 10,000 mu, which is equivalent to 21% of the cultivated land area.

　　During these days in Guli Commune, we have increasingly felt a problem: which commune does not have "ten-edge" marginal land, which agency, school, factory... does not have empty land corners? If they are fully utilized, how much new wealth will be created for our country, and how much richer will our lives be!

　　“借天借地”　万紫千红
　　——记古里公社利用“十边”隙地扩种瓜菜杂粮的成就
    本报记者　孙振　鲍春光　古平
    江南的秋天十分诱人：洞庭蜜桔引人唾涎，中稻穗头相依匍伏在地上，晚稻碧波万倾飘送着芬香。我们到了江苏常熟县古里人民公社，更被新的胜景异境吸引住了。公路旁，白杨落叶，葵花吐艳；田岸上，高粱列队，大豆蔓藤；河边上，南瓜刚刚收完，又是青菜萝卜蜿蜒；村庄里，各种瓜藤豆蔓架起的绿色长廊，绿色凉棚，绿色彩门，还有绿色的墙壁和屋顶……。
    充分利用“十边”隙地，到底有多大的意义？我们到了古里公社以后，才算有了新的认识。
    古里公社利用“十边”隙地种植作物的面积，约有七千四百多亩，等于全社耕地面积的15％以上。在这些隙地上，今年已经收获了南瓜四百五十多万斤，各种蔬菜一百五十多万斤，豆类和杂粮三十多万斤。这些产品如果要运出去，可以装满一百多辆火车车皮！
    古里公社地势低洼，河沟纵横。古里的“古”字，原来是罟鱼的“罟”字，说明许多年以前这里是个渔村。生长在这里的农民，祖祖辈辈没有种过蔬菜和杂粮。有些社员吃过西瓜香瓜，却没有见过瓜藤是什么样子。公社成立以后，这里才开始种蔬菜，但是不能满足社员需要，去年全社向外地购买瓜菜竟达十万元以上。今年全社种的瓜菜不但能够自给，还出售了一部分，收入现金六万八千多元。
    我们在一大队七小队的食堂吃了一顿午饭。这天，社员们吃的是盐水煮毛豆和炒青菜。我们去了以后，炊事员同志到屋前瓜棚上随手摘了一只大丝瓜，又剥了许多毛豆米，为我们加了两只菜。一会儿，炊事员满脸喜悦地把四大碗鲜嫩碧绿的菜送到桌上来了，他说道：“你们尝一尝吧，这些都是我们在‘十边’地上种出来的。”
    过去人们认为这里地势低洼，除了种水稻以外，就再没有土地好种瓜菜、杂粮了。去年秋收以后，公社党委计划利用“十边”隙地播种二十万斤蚕豆种，最初很少有人相信这个规划可以实现。粮食管理所的干部只从县里运回蚕豆种子两万斤，他们想：如果把二十万斤蚕豆种全部运回来，种在什么地方呢？
    一个阴天的上午，公社党委书记和一些生产队的干部划了条小船到连人也站不住的陡坡下面，他们蹲在船上，一个用铁锹在陡坡上挖塘，一个丢种盖种。从离水面一尺以上的地方种起，全部五寸成方地种上了蚕豆。第二天，召开了小队长以上干部参加的现场会，大家看了以后，认为像这样干法，可以利用的土地就多了。粮食管理所的同志于是又陆续运回蚕豆种子十多万斤。今年春季，党委利用“十边”隙地大种瓜菜、杂粮，又有些干部和社员说没有土地了。公社党委又做出了样子：党委书记和十一个大队的干部在一块被日本鬼子烧掉房屋的瓦砾场上，清除掉近百担瓦砾垃圾，种上了瓜菜。这时候，各个生产队的干部和社员们，就不仅是依样照做了，而是人人出主意动脑筋，出现了找缝插针，充分利用“十边”隙地的高潮。
    在一条穿过公社全境的公路两边，白杨树已经落叶了，葵花秆上还正开放着蜡黄的花环。公路的斜坡上，早豆已经收起来了，晚豆也结荚累累。公路斜坡接近水面的地方，还长满了青菜。在稻田四周田埂上，豆蔓连绵成龙，芦秸高粱成行。在纵横交错的大小河边上，在家前屋后的隙地上，到处都是青菜萝卜。在播种青菜萝卜以前，这些地方全部种的南瓜和大豆。社员们说：那时候要是走路不注意，三步五步就要踢着一个大南瓜。走遍这里的大小村庄，处处都和花园一样。许多社员在自己的屋檐边上，用竹枝草绳搭起花架，引上瓜藤豆蔓，真像是一条长长的画廊。许多社员家门前，牌楼似的竹架上，开满了金黄色的丝瓜花和蝴蝶般的紫色扁豆花。在屋前场地和院子里，复盖着密密的瓜藤豆蔓，成为花团锦簇的凉棚。还有些社员引蔓藤作物上墙，比通常所见的长满了“爬山虎”的绿色墙壁还要好看。
    我们第一天来到古里镇上，只见家家户户的绿色门楼、画廊和绿色的墙壁联成一条又一条长龙，竟找不到公社的大门，仔细观看才发现公社党委的牌子隐没在茂密的丝瓜藤里。走进院子，阳光透过瓜棚星星点点地洒在我们身上，我们边走边看，几乎碰着迎面从瓜棚上挂下来的大丝瓜。
    在街道和砖场等没有泥土的地方，人们做了直径二尺、高一尺五寸多的草窝，装进泥土，种上南瓜扁豆，引藤上屋上树。他们把这些充分利用空间和移土种植的方法，叫作“借天借地”。全社这样利用空间的面积，等于平空多出了土地一千多亩，开辟了万紫千红的新天地。
    古里公社是不是因为耕地不够或者是粮食产量不高，才这样重视充分利用“十边”隙地的呢？不是。几年的连续大跃进，人们的思想解放了，眼界也扩大了。他们不仅看到自己公社的事情，还把自己公社和国家整体密切联系在一起，不仅看到眼前利益，而且看到了即将到来的前景。
    古里公社是江南高产地区的公社。公社党委书记告诉我们说：全社有四万八千多亩耕地，平均每人二亩三分，稻麦两熟粮食产量平均每人一千四百斤，全社去年上交国家公粮和出售余粮二千一百多万斤。他们充分利用“十边”隙地，是为了余粮地区多余粮，支援国家社会主义建设。我们遇到了十多个妇女，正在拖拉机道上播种萝卜，这条拖拉机道是今年春天结合兴修水利修筑的。妇女们在拖拉机道上几乎全部种上了萝卜，只留一市尺宽的走道，不久还要夹种上大麦和蚕豆。她们说：现在种得越多，收得越多，拖拉机才会来得越快。
    古里公社从上到下建立了一条线的领导。用他们的说法，公社党委有“十边”书记，生产大队和小队都有“十边”队长，每个生产小队都有三、四个“十边”管理员，他们都是有经验的老年社员。在突击抢种时，集中两三天时间全民动手，平时由管理员专业管理。这几天，社员们正在“十边”隙地上播种蔬菜萝卜和越冬作物，播种面积又从七千多亩增加到一万亩，等于耕地面积的21％。
    在古里公社的这几天，我们越来越强烈地感到一个问题：那一个公社没有“十边”隙地，那一个机关、学校、工厂……没有空地场角，如果充分利用起来，那将为我们国家创造出多少新的财富，那将使我们的生活更加丰富多采！
