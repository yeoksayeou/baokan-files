    On the Drying Ground	Yu Shun
    After dusk, the Dongting Lake area presents a charming scene, with the green carpet of late rice and the silver ribbon of canals faintly visible. In front of the Dongting Commune's First Brigade's office, people are chatting casually on the drying ground.
    Sitting across from me are Rao Hulin, the general branch secretary of the brigade, and cadre Wang Hongxun. Secretary Rao, smoking a cigarette, slowly replied to me:
    "Are you asking about our Director Luo? He is truly a man who loves money like his own life!" He squinted his eyes and smiled triumphantly, as if Luo Debao, the delegate to the Eighth National Congress of the Party and deputy director of the commune, could hear his adjective.
    "Let me tell you a story first: In 1955, when he and I started the agricultural cooperative, we achieved a bumper grain harvest. In May of the following year, as soon as Director Luo returned from a meeting in Beijing, he handed me a package and said, 'Take this and give it to the accountant as an income item.' I thought it was something allocated to us by the county, but when I opened the package, wow! It was a wool coat, a Hero fountain pen, and thirty yuan in cash. I asked, 'Where did this come from?' He said, 'The wool coat and pen are prizes, and the thirty yuan is a travel allowance from the Central Government.' When I heard him say that, I couldn't help but laugh and said, 'This is a reward for you, the model worker; the accountant doesn't have this income item!' Guess what he said? He said seriously:
  ‘And you call yourself the deputy director—I was the deputy director of the agricultural cooperative at that time—you just have the accountant put it in the other income column!’ I knew his temper, so I had to accept it. Later, I used the money to buy a batch of hats for the members."
    I was fascinated by this story. At this moment, Comrade Lao Wang joined the conversation:
    "After the transition to a commune, he once went on a business trip to Changsha and Hankou, a total of more than one hundred and twenty days. When he came back to reimburse his travel expenses, he only had forty-four yuan worth of receipts. Including food and lodging, he only spent 37 cents a day. Even Secretary Zhong of the commune was surprised and asked him:
  ‘Didn't you lose any receipts?’ He replied, ‘No, I only spent this much. I stayed in small hotels and ate simple meals.’ Secretary Zhong told him that, based on his travel time, he could still receive a living allowance of thirty yuan. When he heard this, he quickly said, ‘What allowance! Isn't being on a business trip the same as being at home?’ Later, the clerk gave him the allowance, and after Secretary Zhong explained the reason, he accepted it…"
    When Lao Wang said this, Secretary Rao suddenly interrupted loudly, "Accepted what? After returning to the team, he took out fifteen yuan to buy farm tools and fifteen yuan to treat the members' illnesses. I didn't know about this at first. One day, member Fu Dongchu got sick, and I went to his house to ask if he needed to withdraw any money. He told me that Director Luo had already given him five yuan. Afterwards, I went to ask Director Luo and found out that he hadn't used a single cent of his thirty yuan allowance himself." Secretary Rao lit another cigarette and smiled mysteriously, saying, "I almost forgot to tell you one thing: The county held an expanded cadre meeting a while ago, and the commune notified us to take a boat to the county at noon from the White Horse Temple. Everyone arrived on the boat, and after checking, they couldn't find Director Luo. Secretary Zhong of the commune was so anxious that he was pacing back and forth. As soon as he arrived at the county committee, he rushed to the dispatch room to make a phone call. Who knew that Director Luo was sitting upright in the dispatch room! It turned out that in order to save the public one yuan and twenty cents for the boat fare, he got up early in the morning and walked to the county. I teased him, 'You are really a man who loves money like his own life!' Guess what he replied? He said, 'It doesn't matter if I love money like my own life, the money I love is the wealth of socialism!'"
    After Secretary Rao finished speaking, the three of us were silent, all thinking about something. At this moment, a figure was walking towards us on a country road ahead. As he got closer, Secretary Rao pointed and said, "Speaking of Cao Cao, and Cao Cao arrives. Isn't that Director Luo coming!" I quickly focused my eyes and saw a middle-aged man in his thirties under the moonlight, carrying a hoe on his back, stopping and walking in the fields. He was wearing a white homespun jacket and blue shorts, revealing a pair of bare feet, walking more and more clearly. His high nose and thick lips seemed to be smiling. Secretary Rao said to us softly, "Stop talking quickly, he never likes others talking about these things about him!"

    晒谷场上	禹舜
    黄昏过后，洞庭湖滨一片迷人的景象，那绿毯似的晚禾，那银带似的渠道，都隐隐可见。洞庭公社第一大队部门前的晒谷场上，人们正在漫话家常。
    在我对面坐着的是大队总支书记饶祜林和干部王洪勋。饶书记抽着烟，不慌不忙地回答我：
    “你问我们的罗社长吗？那才真是个爱财如命的人咧！”他眯起眼，得意地笑了起来，仿佛那位党的第八次全国代表大会的代表、公社副社长罗德保同志，听到了他的形容词似的。
    “先向你讲个故事吧：1955年我和他一起办农业社的时候，夺得了粮食大丰收。第二年5月罗社长到北京开会刚一回来，他就递给我一包东西说：‘你收下，交给会计作一项收入账。’我以为是县里拨给我们的什么东西咧，打开包裹一看，嗬！是一件绒衣、一支金星水笔和三十块现款。我问：‘这是那来的呀？’他说：‘绒衣和水笔是奖品，三十块钱是中央发的旅途生活补助费。’我一听他的话，不由得笑了起来，说：‘这是奖给你这位模范的，会计可没有这一项收入科目哩！’你说他怎么着，他严肃地说：
  ‘亏你还当了副社长哩，——我那时是农业社的副社长——你就要会计放在其他收入栏内呗！’我是知道他的脾气的，只得收了下来，后来用这笔钱买了一批?笠给社员。”
    我被这故事吸引住了。这时候，老王同志接上话题了：
    “转公社后，有一次他出差到长沙、汉口，一共去了一百二十多天，回来报销旅差费时，一共只有四十四块钱的条据，连吃饭、住宿在内，每天只花了三角七分钱。这事连公社钟书记也惊讶了起来，问他：
  ‘你没掉条据吧？’他回答说：‘没掉，就用了这么多呀。我住的都是小旅馆，吃的都是小菜便饭。’钟书记告诉他，以他的出差时间计算，还可以领生活补助费三十块钱。他听了这话，忙说道：‘什么补助费呵！出差和在家不也是一样。’后来事务员给他补助费，并经钟书记说明理由，他才收下……”
    老王说到这里，饶书记忽然插嘴高声说：“收了个啥，回到队上后，拿出十五块钱买了农具，十五块钱给了社员治病。这事起先我还不知道哩，有一天社员傅冬初病了，我到他屋里去问他要不要支钱，他告诉我罗社长已送给了他五块钱。事后我去问罗社长，才知道他的三十块钱补助费自己没用一个”。饶书记又点燃了一支烟，带着神秘的口吻笑了笑说：“我还忘记告诉你一件事哩：前响县里开扩干会，公社通知我们中午到白马寺搭轮船去县里。大家到了船上，一查人，却不见罗社长的影子。公社钟书记急得团团转，一到县委会赶紧就到传达室去打电话，谁知罗社长却周周正正坐在传达室哩！原来他为了节省公家一块二角钱船费，一清早就起身走路赶到了县里。我取笑他：‘你这人呀，真是爱财如命！’你说他怎么回答，他说：‘爱财如命也不要紧呀，我爱的是社会主义的财呀。’”
    饶书记说完，我们三人都不响了，都在思索什么。这时候，前面一条田间大道上，一个人影朝着这边走来。看看走近了，饶书记指着说：“真是说到曹操，曹操就到。那不是罗社长来了！”我忙定睛望去，月光下一位三十来岁的中年汉子，背着一把锄头，在田间停停、走走。他上身穿着一件白粗布褂子，蓝蓝的短裤底下露着一双赤脚，越来越清晰地走来，那高高的鼻梁，浑厚的嘴唇，仿佛都在微笑。饶书记细声细气地向我们说：“快莫讲了，他从来不喜欢别人讲他这些事哩！”
