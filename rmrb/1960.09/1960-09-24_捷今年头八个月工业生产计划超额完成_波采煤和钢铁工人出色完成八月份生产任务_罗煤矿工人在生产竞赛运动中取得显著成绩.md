Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 22nd: According to materials from the Czechoslovak State Statistics Bureau, Czechoslovakia completed 101.1% of its industrial production plan for the first eight months of this year. Compared with the same period last year, the total industrial output value increased by 11.7%.

　　In these eight months, the total power generation was 15.593 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 12.3% compared with the same period last year. The output of hard coal and brown coal were 19,731,000 tons and 36,175,000 tons respectively, and the output of pig iron was 3,092,000 tons. The plans for these sectors were all overfulfilled. Steel production reached 4,453,000 tons, an increase of 11.1% compared with the same period last year.

　　Some important machine products also had significant growth compared with last year: a total of 22,743 tractors were produced in the eight months, an increase of 22.3% compared to last year; 36,438 sedans were produced, an increase of 13.5% compared with the same period last year.

　　In terms of per capita industrial output, Czechoslovakia has surpassed some Western European countries such as Italy, France, and Switzerland.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw: According to Polish newspapers and news agencies, both the Polish coal mining and steel industries have overfulfilled their August production targets.

　　Coal miners excellently completed the August production plan by over-extracting 185,000 tons of coal. Considering that August is traditionally a vacation season for employees, this is a great achievement. Among the seventy-three mines that completed the plan, "Meizke," "Huosuo Fu," and "Sobeski" coal mines performed best, completing 111% to 119% of the August plan. In August, the daily labor productivity of coal miners increased by an average of 25 kilograms compared to the plan.

　　Steelworkers reached the highest level of overfulfilling the monthly plan in the history of Polish metallurgy in August. A total of 530,000 tons of steel were produced throughout the month, an increase of 27,000 tons over the original plan. In addition, steel rolling workers overproduced 20,000 tons of steel, and coking workers overproduced 1,000 tons of coke.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, September 23rd: In order to ensure the rapid development of the steel and power industries, Romania is vigorously developing its coal industry. By 1965, its coal production will increase from 2.8 million tons in 1938 to about 12 million tons, an increase of more than threefold.

　　Romanian coal miners have achieved remarkable results in the socialist production emulation campaign. In the first half of this year, miners in the Jiu Valley coal mining area alone overproduced 19,000 tons of coking coal. By the end of August, the Vulcan coal mine in this coal area had over-extracted 7,100 tons of coking coal; in the first few days of September, the average daily over-extraction of coal was more than 60 tons. Since the beginning of this year, the labor productivity of various coal mines has increased. In the first half of this year, the labor productivity of the Lupeni coal mine increased by 19.6% compared to the same period last year.

　　At present, underground mining and transportation in Romania's major coal mines have been basically mechanized. Due to the large increase in machinery and equipment and the continuous increase in the labor enthusiasm of coal miners, the current labor productivity of the coal industry has increased by more than 45% compared with 1955. By 1965, labor productivity will be further increased by 40%.

　　In order to complete the coal production tasks stipulated in the Six-Year Plan (1960-1965), Romania is vigorously improving the production capacity of existing mines and conducting large-scale exploration work to establish more new coal mines. (Attached picture)

　　捷今年头八个月工业生产计划超额完成
    波采煤和钢铁工人出色完成八月份生产任务
    罗煤矿工人在生产竞赛运动中取得显著成绩
    新华社布拉格22日电　据捷克斯洛伐克国家统计局的材料，捷克斯洛伐克今年头八个月的工业生产计划完成了101.1％，与去年同期相比，工业总产值增加了11.7％。
    在这八个月中，总的发电量为一百五十五亿九千三百万度，比去年同时期增加了12.3％。硬煤和褐煤的产量分别为一千九百七十三万一千吨和三千六百一十七万五千吨，生铁产量为三百零九万二千吨。这些部门的计划都超额完成了。钢的生产量达四百四十五万三千吨，比去年同时期增加了11.1％。
    一些重要的机器产品与去年相比也有很大的增长：八个月中共生产了二万二千七百四十三台拖拉机，比去年增加22.3％；生产了三万六千四百三十八辆轿车，比去年同时期增加了13.5％。
    在工业产量按人口平均计算方面，捷克斯洛伐克已经超过了意大利、法国、瑞士等西欧国家。
    据新华社华沙讯　据波兰报纸和通讯社报道，波兰采煤工业和钢铁工业都超额完成了8月份的生产任务。
    煤矿工人以超计划开采十八万五千吨煤的成绩出色地完成了8月份的生产计划。如果考虑到8月份一向是职工休假的季节，那么，这是很大的成就。在完成计划的七十三个矿井中，以“梅兹科”、“霍索夫”和“索贝斯基”煤矿的成绩最好，它们以111％到119％完成了8月份计划。煤矿工人在8月份每日的劳动生产率比计划平均增长了二十五公斤。
    钢铁工人在8月份达到了波兰冶金业历史上超额完成月计划的最高水平，全月共生产了五十三万吨钢，比原计划增加了二万七千吨。此外，轧钢工人超计划多生产了两万吨钢材，炼焦工人超计划多生产了一千吨焦炭。
    新华社布加勒斯特23日电　为保证钢铁工业和动力工业的迅速发展，罗马尼亚正在大力发展煤炭工业。到1965年，它的煤产量将由1938年的二百八十万吨增加到一千二百万吨左右，即增加三倍多。
    罗马尼亚煤矿工人在社会主义生产竞赛运动中取得了显著的成绩。今年上半年，纪乌煤矿区的矿工单是超计划生产的炼焦煤就达一万九千吨。这个煤区的瓦尔康煤矿到8月底已经超计划开采了七千一百吨炼焦煤；在9月份的头几天中每天平均超计划采煤六十多吨。今年以来，各煤矿的劳动生产率都有了提高。今年上半年，路佩尼煤矿的劳动生产率比去年同期提高了19.6％。
    现在，罗马尼亚各主要煤矿的地下采运工作已基本上实现了机械化。由于机器设备大量增加和煤矿工人的劳动热情不断高涨，目前煤炭工业的劳动生产率比1955年提高了45％以上。到1965年以前，劳动生产率还将再提高40％。
    为了完成六年计划（1960——1965年）规定的煤炭生产的任务，罗马尼亚正大力提高现有矿井的生产能力，并进行大规模的勘查工作，建立更多的新煤矿。（附图片）
