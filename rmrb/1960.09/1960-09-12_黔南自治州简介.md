Brief Introduction to the Qiannan Autonomous Prefecture

　　As the Qian-Gui Railway enters Guizhou Province, it first crosses the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. This area is inhabited by more than ten fraternal ethnic groups, including Buyi, Miao, Shui, Yao, Dong, Zhuang, Gelao, and Han, covering an area of ​​more than 28,000 square kilometers, with a population of more than 1.8 million, of which the Buyi and Miao ethnic groups account for more than 43%.

　　The Qiannan area has beautiful mountains and rivers, crisscrossing rivers, with both high mountains and plains, as well as hills and valleys, with alpine regions and subtropical zones, but most areas have a mild climate, abundant rainfall, and fertile land. Crops can be harvested twice a year, and in some areas, three times. It is rich in rice and corn; wheat, millet, sorghum, sweet potatoes, potatoes, as well as buckwheat, red millet, and beans are also abundant. Many areas also produce economic crops such as tobacco, hemp, sugar materials, and oil crops. The famous specialty, flue-cured tobacco, is not only sold to major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, but also a large number of high-quality tobacco leaves are exported abroad every year in recent years. In the subtropical regions of Wangmo and Luodian counties, there are many large sugarcane forests, banana trees, and pineapple plantations. The Buyi people here have been planting sugarcane for more than a hundred years and are known as the "Land of Sugarcane." In addition, there are perennial chili trees, soybean trees, and eggplant trees. When the north has just sown chili seeds, the people here are already eating chilies picked from the trees.

　　Qiannan is also rich in underground resources. There are metal minerals such as iron, copper, aluminum, tin, zinc, and antimony, as well as non-metallic minerals such as petroleum, sulfur, glass sand, rock crystal, and Iceland spar. All eight counties and cities in the prefecture, except Wangmo, have rich coal deposits.

　　After liberation, Qiannan gained a new life. Under the correct leadership of the Party, this mountainous area, rich in resources but very backward in production, is rapidly changing its face. Grain output in 1959 increased 1.5 times compared to 1949, and the yield per mu increased from more than 200 jin to 542 jin. A large amount of surplus grain is transferred every year to support national construction. Under the guidance of the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing diversified operations, economic crops have also been rapidly developed. The total output value in 1959 increased by 7.6 times compared to 1949.

　　The development of industry is even more amazing. By the end of 1959, more than 3,000 various large and small factories and mines had been built in the prefecture, including iron and steel, machinery, chemical, electric power, and light industry. The total industrial output value of the prefecture in 1959 increased 18 times compared to 1949. The proportion of industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value increased from 10% in 1949 to 38.66%. Before liberation, there were only 229 kilometers of highways, which increased to 1,769 kilometers last year. All county towns, more than 80% of the communes, and most of the management areas were accessible by car.

    黔南自治州简介
    黔桂铁路一跨入贵州境，就是黔南布依族苗族自治州。这里居住着布依、苗、水、瑶、侗、僮、仡佬、汉等十多个兄弟民族，面积二万八千多平方公里，人口一百八十余万，其中布依族和苗族占43％以上。
    黔南地区山川秀丽，河流纵横，有高山和平坝，也有丘陵和河谷，有高寒山区，也有亚热带地区，但是大部分地区气候温和，雨量充沛，土地肥沃，农作物一年两熟，部分地区可以三熟。这里盛产水稻和玉米；小麦、小米、高粱、红苕、洋芋以及荞子、红稗、豆类等杂粮也不少。许多地区还盛产烟、麻、糖料、油料等经济作物，著名的特产烤烟，除运销北京、上海等各大城市外，近年来每年都有大批上等烟叶出口国外。在望谟、罗甸两县的亚热带地区，有许多成片的甘蔗林、芭蕉树和菠萝园地。这里的布依族人民种植甘蔗已有一百多年的历史，素有“蔗乡”之称。此外这里还有多年生的辣椒树、黄豆树和茄子树等。当北方刚刚播下辣椒种子时，这里已吃到从树上摘下来的辣椒了。
    黔南的地下资源也很丰富。有铁、铜、铝、锡、锌、锑等金属矿藏，还有石油、硫磺、玻璃砂、水晶石、冰州石等非金属矿。全州八个县市，除望谟外，县县都有丰富的煤藏。
    解放后，黔南获得了新生，在党的正确领导下，这个资源丰富而生产却十分落后的山区，迅速地改变着自己的面貌。粮食产量1959年比1949年增长一点五倍，单产由原来的二百多斤提高到五百四十二斤。每年都调出大批余粮支援国家建设。在以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营的方针指导下，经济作物也得到了迅速的发展，总产值1959年较1949年增长七点六倍。
    工业的发展更是惊人。到1959年止，全州已建成钢铁、机械、化工、电力和轻工业等各种大小厂矿三千多个，全州工业总产值1959年比1949年增长十八倍。工业产值在工农业总产值中所占的比重，从1949年的10％上升到38.66％。公路解放前只有二百二十九公里，去年就增至一千七百六十九公里，所有的县城、80％以上的公社和大部分管理区通了汽车。
