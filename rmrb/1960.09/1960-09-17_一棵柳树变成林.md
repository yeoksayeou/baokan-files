    A Willow Tree Becomes a Forest
      Zhang Ming
  Willow branches are long, willow leaves are green,
  A willow forest by the sea is seen,
  Deep in the willow shade, a哨所 stands tall,
  In spring, the coastal defense blooms like a brocade shawl.
  The soldiers point at the willow forest,
  Eagerly telling of the one who planted, no detest:
  The old squad leader, a thousand miles to visit home he went,
  Bringing back willow branches to the border, heaven-sent.
  The willow branches planted by the sea's embrace,
  Sprout and grow, branches and leaves interlace,
  Breaking off willow twigs, planting them in the soil,
  Three to five years, a forest to behold, without toil.
  A single willow tree becomes a forest vast,
  Sheltering from wind and rain, shade that will last,
  The old squad leader leaves the borderland,
  Leaving behind a loyal heart, close at hand!
  We must learn from the willow, grow everywhere,
  Roots deep in the borderland, without compare!
  We must learn from the loyal old squad leader,
  A red heart dedicated to the revolution, a true pleader!

    一棵柳树变成林
      章明
  柳条儿长，柳叶儿青，
  海边一座柳树林，
  柳荫深处有哨所，
  海防春来花似锦。
  战士们指点柳树林，
  纷纷说起种树的人：
  老班长千里去探家，
  带回柳枝到边境。
  柳枝种在大海边，
  发芽抽条枝叶深，
  折下柳条插下土，
  三年五载成了林。
  一棵柳树变成林，
  秋挡风雨夏遮阴，
  老班长离开边疆地，
  留下了一颗忠诚的心！
  要学柳树到处生，
  扎下深根在边境！
  要学忠诚的老班长，
  一颗红心为革命！
