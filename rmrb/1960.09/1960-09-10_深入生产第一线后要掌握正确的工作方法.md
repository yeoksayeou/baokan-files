    Some young comrades who have not been working for long also understand the purpose and significance of going deep into the production front line, but they do not know how to do mass work and are troubled by the lack of methods. Such comrades are not a minority among our cadres. For them, going deep into the production front line is undoubtedly a good opportunity to train and improve themselves. However, going deep into the production front line is only an organizational measure. From going deep down to being able to master the correct working methods and develop the correct working style, it still requires a relatively long learning process. The current problem is how to enable these comrades to quickly learn and develop the correct working methods and working style.
    What are the correct working methods and the correct working style? Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his article "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership": "In all the practical work of our Party, all correct leadership is necessarily 'from the masses, to the masses'. This means: take the ideas of the masses (scattered and unsystematic ideas) and concentrate them (through study turn them into concentrated and systematic ideas), then go to the masses and propagate and explain these ideas until the masses embrace them as their own, hold on to them and translate them into action, and test the correctness of these ideas in such action. Then once again concentrate ideas from the masses and once again go to the masses so that the ideas are persevered in and carried through. And so on, over and over again in an endless spiral, with the ideas becoming more correct, more vital and richer each time." Comrade Mao Zedong said: "All work done for the masses must start from their needs and not from the desire of any individual, however well-intentioned." Concerning the relationship between the working method of combining the general and the individual and the working method of combining leadership and the masses, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Take the ideas of the masses (scattered and unsystematic ideas) and concentrate them (through study turn them into concentrated and systematic ideas), then go to the masses and propagate and explain these ideas until the masses embrace them as their own, hold on to them and translate them into action, and test the correctness of these ideas in such action. Then once again concentrate ideas from the masses and once again go to the masses so that the ideas are persevered in and carried through. And so on, over and over again in an endless spiral, with the ideas becoming more correct, more vital and richer each time, this is the basic method of leadership. In the process of concentration and perseverance, the method of combining general appeals and individual guidance must be adopted, which is an integral part of the previous method."
    According to Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, no matter what work we do, the first step must be "from the masses," to "concentrate" the "scattered and unsystematic opinions" of the masses, and "transform them into concentrated and systematic opinions" through research. In order to achieve this goal, we should consult the masses and willingly be primary school students of the masses. The fundamental way to consult the masses, understand the situation, and discover problems is to conduct thorough investigations of the masses. Comrade Mao Zedong said in the preface and postscript to "<Rural Survey>": "To understand the situation, the only way is to conduct investigations of society, to investigate the vivid situation of all classes of society." There are two ways to conduct investigations: one is to hold investigation meetings, and the other is to conduct individual visits. The so-called investigation meeting is to convene a certain number of people together for a discussion. The number of people participating in such investigation meetings should not be too many, seven or eight, or ten or so is enough. If there are too many people, not everyone can speak freely. But it should not be too few either, because too few people cannot understand more situations. Investigation meetings must have a purpose. Generally, the items to be investigated should be thought out in advance, and it is best to prepare a relatively detailed investigation outline. Investigation meetings must be lively and vigorous, and we must talk about the situation, collect materials, analyze, and discuss at the same time. We cannot simply ask and answer, and you say and I write. Although holding investigation meetings is the basic method for understanding the situation and discovering problems, it is not the only method. Therefore, we must also adopt another method, that is, the method of individual visits. The method of individual visits is the method we used during the land reform, that is, "visiting the poor and asking about their sufferings, individually mobilizing, and individually connecting." We should continue to uphold and carry forward the fine traditions of the "Old Eighth Route Army" and the "land reform cadres," share weal and woe with the masses, and care about the production of the masses as well as the lives of the masses. Can the canteen be able to eat enough, eat well, and save money? Is there a balance between work and rest? In short, we attach great importance to all issues closely related to the production and life of the masses. Only in this way can we become good friends and confidants of the masses, and the masses will tell us their inner thoughts.
    When conducting investigations of the masses, we must widely listen to the opinions of all kinds of people. We must listen to the opinions of advanced elements, as well as the opinions of backward elements; we must listen to the opinions of the majority, as well as the opinions of the minority, even the opinion of one person. Some comrades are often only willing to listen to the opinions of advanced elements, the opinions of the majority, while not paying enough attention to the opinions of backward elements, the opinions of the minority, especially the opinion of one person. This is wrong. Backward elements, like advanced elements, are also engaged in production practice every day, and they also understand many situations, understand many principles, and can see many problems. Practice produces wisdom, and the masses are the ocean of wisdom. These principles apply to both advanced elements and backward elements. Therefore, it is completely wrong to only be willing to listen to the opinions of advanced elements and not pay attention to the opinions of backward elements. As the saying goes, "Everyone is a sage," "Many people have broad knowledge," which is correct. However, in objective practice, there are often facts of "original insights" and "soberness in a world of drunkenness." The standard of truth is the conformity of the subjective with the objective. As long as one person's understanding conforms to the objective reality, then he has grasped the truth. Therefore, when conducting investigations of the masses, we should not only listen to the opinions of the majority, but also pay attention to the opinions of the minority, even the opinion of one person, and we must not simply and easily deny their opinions. At the same time, in order to pursue the truth, we must advocate daring to adhere to opinions, daring to "sing a different tune," and resolutely oppose the vulgar style of not telling the truth and following the wind. The "Communist Manifesto" says: "The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims." This should become the motto of every Communist Party member and revolutionary cadre.
    After mastering a large amount of material through investigation, we should then move from the process of discovering problems to the process of analyzing problems, and "transform and create" the material through a process of "discarding the crude and selecting the refined, discarding the false and retaining the true, moving from this to that, and from the outside to the inside," so that it can rise from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge, and formulate solutions to problems that not only conform to the Party's lines, principles, and policies, but also conform to the specific conditions of the time and place. In order to achieve this goal, we must use our brains, think hard, and also be good at thinking. Because the purpose of investigation is to master rich materials, use the method of class analysis, and find out the internal connections, that is, the laws, of objective things. However, laws are invisible and intangible. Marx said in the preface to the first edition of the first volume of "Capital": "In the analysis of economic forms, neither microscopes nor chemical reagents can be used. The power of abstraction must replace both." It can be seen that, to discover the laws of things and find the correct methods to solve problems, it is impossible without thinking hard.
    Investigating materials, analyzing problems, and formulating plans all belong to the stage of people's understanding of the objective world, which is the stage of "from the masses" as Comrade Mao Zedong said, but the ultimate goal of Communists is to transform the world. As Marx pointed out in the "Theses on Feuerbach," "The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it." Therefore, after we have formulated a solution to the problem, we must enter the stage of educating the masses, fully mobilizing the masses, maximizing the enthusiasm of the masses, and working with the masses to quickly solve the problem, which is the stage of "to the masses" as Comrade Mao Zedong said. Only in this way does it make sense to understand the world. The attitude of turning a blind eye to problems in work and not actively trying to solve them is an extremely irresponsible performance to the cause of the Party and the people, which we must oppose. At the same time, in the process of solving problems, we must also oppose the adoption of simple, rigid, and commandist working methods and working styles. The people are the creators of history. This is an irrefutable Marxist-Leninist principle. Without the conscious action of the broad masses, nothing can be done well. Therefore, the work plans and solutions to problems formulated based on the Party's line, principles, and policies and the actual situation must be completely transformed into the masses' own things. This requires patient persuasion and education work for the masses, raising the thinking of the masses to the level of the Party's policies, and turning the intentions of the leadership into the actions of the masses. Only in this way can the work plans and solutions to problems that we put forward be smoothly implemented.
    When investigating materials and understanding the situation from the masses, when conducting analysis and synthesis and raising issues, and when formulating work plans and implementing them, we must adhere to the spirit of seeking truth from facts from beginning to end. This is the principle that must be followed in understanding and transforming the world. Whether or not we can adhere to this principle is a touchstone for testing whether a Communist Party member or revolutionary cadre can adhere to the principle of Party spirit and whether or not they can adhere to the dialectical materialist world outlook. The so-called seeking truth from facts means being honest, one is one, and two is two. We cannot call a deer a horse, nor can we call a horse a deer. We should say how great the achievements are, and we should say how many shortcomings there are. Of course, accurately understanding objective things requires a process. Before the essence of objective things is fully exposed, it is inevitable that we will either understand them too much or not enough. However, we must never engage in falsehood, conceal shortcomings, or exaggerate achievements. Only with an honest attitude can we implement the dialectical materialist world outlook into practical work.

### 深入生产第一线后要掌握正确的工作方法

    深入生产第一线后要掌握正确的工作方法
    有些参加工作不久的青年同志，也了解深入生产第一线的目的和意义，就是不会做群众工作，苦于没有办法。这样的同志在我们的干部中还不是少数。对于他们来说，深入生产第一线，无疑是锻炼和提高自己的一个很好的机会。但是，深入生产第一线，这只是一个组织措施，从深入下去到能够掌握正确的工作方法，养成正确的工作作风，还需要一个较长的学习过程。现在的问题是，如何使这些同志尽快地学会和养成正确的工作方法和工作作风。
    什么是正确的工作方法、正确的工作作风呢？毛泽东同志在《关于领导方法的若干问题》一文中指出：“我们共产党人无
  论进行何项工作，有两个方法是必须采用的，一是一般和个别相结合，二是领导和群众相结合。”毛泽东同志说：“任何工作任务，如果没有一般的普遍的号召，就不能动员广大群众行动起来。但如果只限于一般号召，而领导人员没有具体地直接地从若干组织将所号召的工作深入实施，突破一点，取得经验，然后利用这种经验去指导其他单位，就无法考验自己提出的一般号召是否正确，也无法充实一般号召的内容，就有使一般号召归于落空的危险。”关于一般和个别相结合的工作方法同领导和群众相结合的工作方法二者之间的关系，毛泽东同志指
  出：“从群众中集中起来又到群众中坚持下去，以形成正确的领导意见，这是基本的领导方法。在集中和坚持过程中，必须采取一般号召和个别指导相结合的方法，这是前一个方法的组成部分。”
    根据毛泽东同志的指示，我们无论做什么工作，第一步都必须是“从群众中来”，把群众的“分散的无系统的意见”
  “集中起来”，“经过研究，化为集中的系统的意见”。为了达到这个目的，就应该去向群众请教，甘当群众的小学生。向群众请教、了解情况和发现问题的根本途径，是向群众进行周密的调查。毛泽东同志在《〈农村调查〉的序言和跋》中说：
  “要了解情况，唯一的方法是向社会作调查，调查社会各阶级的生动情况。”进行调查的办法有两个，一个是开调查会，一个是个别访问。所谓开调查会，也就是召集一定数量的人到一起进行座谈。这样的调查会参加的人数不宜过多，有七八个、十来个就行，人多了就不能使所有的人都畅所欲言。但是也不能太少，人太少了不能了解到较多的情况。开调查会一定要有目的，一般应当事先想好调查的项目，最好能够拟出一个比较详细的调查提纲。调查会要开得生动、活泼，必须边谈情况、边兜材料、边分析、边议论，不能简单地我问你答，你说我记。开调查会虽然是了解情况、发现问题的基本方法，但却不是唯一的方法。因此，我们还必须采用另一种方法，即个别访问的方法。个别访问的方法，也就是我们在土改时所使用的“访贫问苦、个别发动、个别串连”的方法。我们应该继续坚持和发扬“老八路”和“土改干部”的优良传统，和群众同甘共苦，既关心群众的生产，又关心群众的生活。食堂是不是能吃饱、吃好、吃省？干活是不是有劳有逸？总之，凡是与群众的生产、生活密切相关的问题，我们都给以极大的重视。只有这样，我们才能成为群众的好朋友、知心人，群众才会向我们说心里话。
    向群众作调查，必须广泛地倾听各种人的意见。既要倾听先进分子的意见，又要倾听后进分子的意见；既要倾听大多数人的意见，又要倾听少数人甚至一个人的意见。有的同志往往只愿意倾听先进分子的意见，大多数人的意见，而对于后进分子的意见，少数人的意见、特别是一个人的意见则重视不够。这是错误的。后进分子和先进分子一样，也是每天在生产实践中，也了解许多情况，懂得许多道理，也能看出不少问题。实践出智慧，群众是智慧的海洋，这些道理既适用于先进分子，也适用于后进分子。所以，只愿意倾听先进分子的意见，而不重视后进分子的意见，是完全错误的。俗话说：“众人是圣人”，“人多见识广”，这是正确的。但是，在客观实践中，又往往有“独创之见”和“众醉独醒”的事实。真理的标准是主观符合客观，一个人的认识只要符合客观实际情况，那他就是掌握了真理。所以在向群众进行调查的时候，不仅应当倾听大多数人的意见，而且也应当重视少数人甚至一个人的意见，对于他们的意见绝不能简单地、轻易地加以否定。同时，为了追求真理，我们要提倡敢于坚持意见，敢于“唱对台戏”，坚决反对那种不说真话、看风转舵的庸俗作风。《共产党宣言》中说：“共产党人认为隐秘自己的观点和意图是件可鄙的事情。”这应当成为每一个共产党员和革命干部的座右铭。
    经过调查，掌握了大量的材料以后，紧接着就应当由发现问题的过程进入分析问题的过程，把材料经过一番“去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里的改造制作工夫”，使之由感性认识上升到理性认识，制定出既符合于党的路线、方针、政策，又符合于当时、当地的具体情况的解决问题的方案来。为了达到这个目的，就必须开动脑子，多思苦想，并且还要善于思索。因为调查的目的，是为了掌握丰富的材料，运用阶级分析的方法，找出客观事物的内部联系即规律来。但是，规律是看不见、摸不着的东西。马克思在《资本论》第一卷的初版序中说：“在经济形态的分析上，既不能用显微镜，也不能用化学反应药。那必须用抽象力来代替二者。”可见，要发现事物的规律，寻找解决问题的正确方法，不用脑子好好想一想是不行的。
    调查材料、分析问题、制定方案，都是属于人们认识客观世界的阶段，也就是毛泽东同志所说的“从群众中来”的阶段，但是共产党人的最终目的却是改造世界。正如马克思在《费尔巴哈论纲》中所指出的，“哲学家们只是用不同的方式说明过世界，而问题却在于要改变世界。”因此，在我们制定了解决问题的方案以后，就必须进入教育群众，充分发动群众，把群众的积极性最大限度地调动起来，和群众一起迅速地解决问题的阶段，也就是进入毛泽东同志所说的“到群众中去”的阶段。只有这样，认识世界才有意义。那种对于工作中的问题，熟视无睹，不积极地设法解决的态度，是对党、对人民的事业极端不负责任的表现，我们固然要反对，同时，在解决问题的过程中，我们也要反对采取简单的、生硬的、命令主义的工作方法和工作作风。人民群众创造历史，这是一条颠扑不破的马克思列宁主义原理，没有广大群众的自觉行动是任何事情也做不好的。因此，必须把依据党的路线、方针、政策和实际情况制定出来的工作计划和解决问题的方案，完全变成群众自己的东西。这就需要对群众进行耐心的说服教育工作，把群众的思想提高到党的政策水平上来，把领导的意图变为群众的行动。只有这样，我们提出的工作计划和解决问题的方案，才能得到顺利的贯彻执行。
    在向群众调查材料、了解情况的时候，在进行分析综合、提出问题的时候，在制定工作计划以及贯彻执行计划的时候，都要自始至终地坚持实事求是的精神。这是认识世界和改造世界必须遵循的原则。能不能坚持这个原则，是考验一个共产党员或革命干部能不能坚持党性原则，能不能坚持辩证唯物主义世界观的试金石。所谓实事求是，就是老老实实，一就是一，二就是二，不能指鹿为马，也不能指马为鹿，成绩有多大就说多大，缺点有多少就说多少。当然，准确地认识客观事物是需要有一个过程的，在客观事物的本质完全暴露出来以前，不是认识得过了，就是认识得不足，这是难免的。但是，绝不能弄虚作假，隐瞒缺点，夸大成绩。只有抱着诚实的态度，才能把辩证唯物主义的世界观贯彻到实际工作中去。
