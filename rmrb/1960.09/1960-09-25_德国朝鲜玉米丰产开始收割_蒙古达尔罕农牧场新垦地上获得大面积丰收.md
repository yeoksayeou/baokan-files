Xinhua News Agency, Berlin. This year, the German Democratic Republic will harvest approximately 15 million tons of feed corn, over 7 million tons of sugar beets, and 14 million tons of potatoes. This represents a 45% increase in corn production compared to last year, with average yields of sugar beets and potatoes also increasing.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry announced that corn harvesting has begun in various regions. As of September 13th, approximately 19% of the country's cornfields had been harvested, with the Berlin, Suhl, and Cottbus districts leading the way, having harvested approximately 40% respectively. Nationally, 11% of potatoes have been harvested, with the Berlin district having harvested 30%.

Helmut Koch, State Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, recently emphasized the importance of mass political work and strict government supervision at a meeting of the district agricultural advisory committee held in Frankfurt on the Oder River. He stated that the achievements in the grain harvesting work have proven this point.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang. North Korea is experiencing an exceptionally good corn harvest this year. Agricultural cooperative members in various parts of northern Korea are harvesting corn with joy.

Agricultural cooperatives in South Hwanghae Province planted over 20,000 chongbo (one chongbo equals fifteen Chinese mu) of corn more than originally planned. According to preliminary estimates, South Hwanghae Province can harvest two to two and a half tons of corn per chongbo. The Cheolsan Agricultural Cooperative in Eunryul County can harvest an average of three tons per chongbo on its 427 chongbo of cornfields, with some areas even yielding six tons.

North Hamgyong Province planted a total of over 68,000 chongbo of corn this year. Thanks to the cooperative members' diligent fertilization and weeding, each chongbo can yield 500 kilograms more corn than last year.

In order not to waste a single grain of corn, the agricultural cooperative members have adopted the method of harvesting the ripe areas first. The agricultural cooperatives in Yonghung County, South Hamgyong Province, have also organized "youth shock brigades." While harvesting and threshing, many agricultural cooperatives are selecting the best corn to pay agricultural taxes to the state in kind.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, September 23rd. The newly built Darhan Farm in Mongolia has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest on newly cultivated land this year. It is expected that the farm will greatly exceed its task of delivering 13,000 tons of grain to the state this year.

The Darhan Farm is located in northern Mongolia near the Selenga River. The soil there is very fertile and the climate is relatively mild. A year ago, more than 80 young people responded to the call of the Mongolian Party and government and came to this wilderness to reclaim land and build the farm. This spring, the farm workers sowed wheat on 20,000 hectares of newly cultivated land.

Currently, seven agricultural production teams are engaged in intensive autumn harvesting on large tracts of land in the southeastern part of the farm. Young men and women who have just learned the techniques are driving combine harvesters non-stop to cut wheat. Dozens of trucks are shuttling back and forth transporting wheat. People's Liberation Army soldiers and workers who have come to the farm to help with the autumn harvest are using machines to winnow grain on the threshing floor. A bustling scene of harvest is present everywhere in the vast fields.

Badar, the farm director, told Xinhua reporters that all the young workers in the farm voluntarily applied to participate in land reclamation and agricultural production. They first learned to drive tractors, and after the wasteland was planted with crops, they began to learn to operate combine harvesters. They learned and produced at the same time. Now, most of the wheat on the newly cultivated land has been harvested, and it is estimated that each hectare can yield 14 to 15 quintals of wheat, with some production teams yielding 26 quintals per hectare. Many advanced producers have emerged in land reclamation and production.

The director also said that the farm will further reclaim land and develop animal husbandry next year.

    德国朝鲜玉米丰产开始收割
　  蒙古达尔罕农牧场新垦地上获得大面积丰收
    据新华社柏林讯　今年德意志民主共和国将收获大约一千五百万吨饲料玉米，七百多万吨甜菜和一千四百万吨马铃薯。这比去年的玉米产量增加45％，甜菜和马铃薯的平均产量也有增加。
    农林部宣布，玉米的收获工作已在各地开始。到9月13日止，全国大约有19％的玉米地已经收获完毕，而走在前面的柏林、苏尔和科特布斯专区已分别收获了大约40％。全国马铃薯有11％已经收获完毕，柏林专区已收获了30％。
    农林部国务秘书赫尔穆特·科赫最近在奥得河上的法兰克福举行的专区农业咨询委员会会议上，强调指出了群众政治工作和严格的政府监督的重要性，他说，在粮食收割工作中的成绩就证实了这一点。
    据新华社平壤讯　朝鲜北部的玉米今年获得了往年少有的好收成。朝鲜北部各地农业社的社员们正怀着愉快的心情收割玉米。
    黄海南道的农业社今年比原计划多种了二万多町步（一町步合十五市亩）玉米。据初步计算，黄海南道每町步可收两吨到两吨半玉米。殷栗郡铁山农业社在四百二十七町步玉米田地上平均每町步可收三吨，有的甚至可以收到六吨。
    咸镜南道今年一共种了六万八千多町步玉米。由于农业社员们施肥多、锄草勤，所以每町步可以比去年多收五百公斤玉米。
    农业社员们为了不浪费一粒玉米，采取了那块地先熟就先收那块、熟一块收一块的办法。咸镜南道永兴郡各农业社还组织了“青年突击队”。在边收边打当中，许多农业社都挑选出最好的玉米向国家交实物税。
    新华社乌兰巴托23日电　蒙古新建的达尔罕农牧场今年在新垦地上获得大面积丰收。预计，这个农牧场今年向国家上缴一万三千吨粮食的任务可以大大超额完成。
    达尔罕农牧场建立在蒙古北部靠近色楞格河的地方。那里的土壤十分肥沃，气候比较暖和。一年以前，八十多名青年响应蒙古党和政府的号召，来到这片荒原上开荒建场。今年春天，农牧场的工人在两万公顷新垦地上播下了小麦。
    目前，在农牧场东南部的大片土地上，有七个农业生产队正在紧张地进行秋收。刚刚学会了技术的男女青年们驾驶着收获联合机在不停地割麦。几十辆载重汽车来回奔驰运送麦子。到农牧场帮助秋收的人民军战士和职工们，在打麦场上用机器扬场。辽阔的田野上到处呈现着一片繁忙的丰收景象。
    农牧场场长巴达尔对新华社记者说，全场青年工人都是自愿申请前来参加垦荒和发展农业生产的。他们先学习驾驶拖拉机，等到荒地种上庄稼后又开始学习操使收获联合机。他们就这样一边学习一边生产。现在，新垦地上的小麦已大部收割完毕，估计每公顷能收十四到十五公担小麦，有的生产队每公顷可收二十六公担。在垦荒、生产中出现了许多先进生产者。
    场长还说，明年农牧场将进一步垦荒，并同时发展畜牧业。
