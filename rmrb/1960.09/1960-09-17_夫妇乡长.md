Husband and Wife Township Chiefs 	Zhao Jialie

On July 17th, Dawa Guojie, the township chief of Zhangda Township in Zaxi Raodeng District, Milin County, Tibet, was approved to be a glorious probationary member of the Communist Party of China. When branch secretary Fu Liexian told him this good news, he excitedly expressed to the Party: "Under the guidance and cultivation of the Party, I will unswervingly dedicate everything, even my life, to the Party, and serve the people wholeheartedly." He stated that he would not only work and study hard, but also help the deputy township chief—his wife, Yangzong—to do her job well, improve her awareness, and strive to join the Party.

		Igniting a Raging Fire

When it comes to this Tibetan husband and wife township chief team, everyone praises them. The Milin County three-level cadre meeting commended them as "good cadres," and the emancipated farmers of Zhangda Township praised them endlessly, calling them "Township Chief Ya Ga" (good township chief) and "Township Chief Echu Mima" (our people's township chief).

The reason why Dawa Guojie and Yangzong are praised is mainly because, under the leadership of the Party, they share the fate and breathe the same air as the broad masses of emancipated farmers.

Last year, the Party sent them to this township to lead the farmers in carrying out the democratic reform movement. At that time, some farmers who had suffered a lot still couldn't see the power of the working people themselves, and were full of worries, not daring to resolutely rise up to struggle. At this time, Dawa Guojie and Yangzong went deep into the homes of the worried and poorest people to visit them, ask about their suffering, and incite them to recount their pain. They first told the villagers about their own painful past and happy present, and then listened to the villagers tell about their own tragic experiences. When they got to the sad part, they cried together; when they talked about injustice, they roared with anger together. In this way, the fire of democratic reform burned fiercely throughout the township. The serfs launched a face-to-face struggle with the serf owners, and the chains of the feudal serf system were smashed like withered leaves by the awakened serfs.

		Enlightening Old Man Jiangba

At that time, an old man named Jiangba had a low level of class consciousness. In order to enlighten his class consciousness, Dawa Guojie moved into the old man's low and damp room to live, letting fleas and lice bite him, eating and living with the old man, and talking heart-to-heart, using many facts to expose the crimes of the three major estate-holders, and using his own experience as an example to enlighten old man Jiangba. He introduced to the old man that he and Yangzong were both twenty-eight or nine years old and were now revolutionary cadres, but they had spent more than twenty years of their past lives as slaves. From the age of eight, they each inherited the hereditary status of slaves from their parents and farmed for a landlord in Xigaze, working barefoot in winter and eating bad zanba all year round, until they were twenty-three or twenty-four years old. It was when the Communist Party led the construction of the Lhasa-Xigaze highway that they escaped from the clutches of the vicious serf owners. During the road construction, with the help of the staff and the People's Liberation Army comrades, they realized that the feudal serf system was the reason for their suffering. In 1956, they were sent to the Tibet Public School to study. Dawa Guojie said to old man Jiangba, "It is the Communist Party that has given us the happiness we have today. Only the Communist Party is the savior of us poor people." His words deeply touched the old man's heart, and from then on, Jiangba resolutely threw himself into the struggle to win emancipation.

		Welcoming the Upsurge in Production

With the victory of the democratic reform, Zhangda Township set off an upsurge in agricultural production. Due to long-term feudal rule, the conservative habits of the peasant masses were quite strong. At this time, based on the Party's policies and instructions, they guided the farmers to carry out a revolution in agricultural production technology. They set an example in everything and conducted various experiments, reclaiming the third-class land that the masses were unwilling to cultivate, and planted one ke (equivalent to one mu) of wheat, one ke of highland barley, one ke of fodder, one ke of vegetables, half a ke of peas, half a ke of rapeseed, and half a ke of potatoes. In addition, they also raised three pigs and eighteen chickens. They made a model in their own experimental fields, publicized the significance of deep plowing and careful cultivation to the farmers, and promoted the production of the entire township.

Dawa Guojie and Yangzong put in a lot of effort to change the farmers' habit of not applying much fertilizer. The farmers here originally applied only about fifty baskets (fifty catties per basket) of base fertilizer per ke of land, without applying top dressing, let alone using human manure as fertilizer. At the beginning, when Dawa Guojie asked everyone to apply more base fertilizer, there were many discussions. Some said that too much fertilizer would prevent the seedlings from emerging, and some said that too much fertilizer would burn the seedlings to death. Therefore, he explained to the masses: fertilizer is the food of crops, and the more fertilizer, the stronger the seedlings. The masses' understanding improved, and their enthusiasm for fertilizing increased. More than two hundred baskets of base fertilizer were applied to each ke of land. When the crops grew up and needed top dressing, Yangzong led the masses to apply top dressing four times in a row, reaching one hundred baskets per ke of land.

The most difficult thing to do was to use human manure as top dressing, which the farmers were always unwilling to do. In order to convince the masses, Dawa Guojie and Yangzong carried two hundred baskets of human manure and applied it to their own wheat experimental field. As a result, when the wheat seedlings were ripe, the plant height reached one meter seven or eight, the ear length was three inches, and the number of grains per ear was generally eighty or ninety, which was the best crop in this area. The farmers came to visit constantly, and regretted that they should not have listened to the township chief, and said that they would definitely do so next year. So, every household in the township built toilets and accumulated human manure fertilizer.

	Participating in Production, Leading Production

The reason why Dawa Guojie and Yangzong are most loved by the masses is that they work hard and practically with the masses. They are experts in all kinds of farm work. When going to work in the villages, they carry a small bag of zanba and live in the homes of the poorest people. Wherever they go, and whatever the farmers are doing, they get involved. They often publicize the Party's policies and arrange the current work by plowing, sowing, carrying manure, and weeding with the masses. According to statistics from branch secretary Fu Liexian, who worked with Dawa Guojie for forty-five days, he did a total of eighteen days of work for the masses. He and the farmers' association committee members or mutual aid team leaders would do half a day of work and arrange the work properly, explaining the work methods and steps clearly, and then the farmers' association committee members or team leaders would preside over mass meetings to discuss, which not only cultivated the working ability of grassroots cadres, but also achieved twice the result with half the effort. In this way, all the work in the township was done in a solid and down-to-earth manner, and almost all of it was at the forefront of the various townships in Milin County.

	The Confidants of the Masses

Dawa Guojie and Yangzong care about the masses in every way, and the masses also regard them as their own relatives, always liking to talk to them and chat about their families. The young people work with Dawa Guojie with great enthusiasm and make a lot of noise, asking Dawa Guojie to teach them to sing "Socialism is Good" and "The East is Red", and asking him to talk about how to walk to socialism. If the old people don't see Yangzong go to their village for a few days, they always ask where she is, or run to visit her. In April, Yangzong was about to give birth and did not go to the fields. The old women always ran to see her every two or three days, some bringing eggs and some bringing milk, repeatedly telling her not to work and to eat better. In the days before giving birth, there were always one or two old women accompanying Yangzong. When she gave birth to a fat "Bumu" (daughter), even more people came to visit, as if they were celebrating their own happy event.

    夫妇乡长	赵家烈
    7月17日，西藏米林县扎西绕登区章达乡的乡长大娃郭杰，被批准为光荣的中国共产党的预备党员。当支部书记傅烈贤告诉他这个喜讯的时候，他激动地向党表示：“在党的教导和培养下，我坚定不移地把自己的一切甚至生命献给党，全心全意为人民服务。”他表示自己不但要努力工作和学习，还要帮助副乡长——自己的爱人央宗做好工作、提高觉悟、争取入党。
          燃起熊熊烈火
    提起这对藏族夫妇乡长，真是人人赞、个个夸。米林县三级干部会议表扬他们“好干部”，章达乡的翻身农民群众，更是赞不绝口地称他们是“乡长亚呷”（好乡长）、“额楚密玛乡长”（我们人民的乡长）。
    大娃郭杰和央宗所以受称赞，主要是因为他们在党的领导下，与广大翻身农民同命运、共呼吸。
    去年，党把他们派到这个乡，来领导农民开展民主改革运动。当时，有些饱经苦难的农民，一时还看不到劳动人民自己的力量，顾虑重重，不敢毅然地起来斗争。这时候，大娃郭杰和央宗，便深入到有顾虑、最穷苦的群众家去访贫问苦，诉苦引苦。他们先向乡亲们诉说自己痛苦的过去和幸福的现在，然后再听乡亲们诉说自己的惨痛遭遇。诉到伤心处，他们一起哭；说到不平处，他们一起发出愤怒的吼声。这样，民主改革的烈火，便在全乡熊熊地燃烧起来。农奴与农奴主展开了面对面的说理斗争，封建农奴制度的锁链，就如同摧枯拉朽一般，被觉醒了的农奴打烂砸碎了。
            启发降巴老人
    当时有一个名叫降巴的老人阶级觉悟较低，为了启发他的阶级觉悟，大娃郭杰就搬到老人低矮潮湿的房里去住，任凭跳蚤虱子叮咬，与老人同吃同住，促膝谈心，用许多事实揭露三大领主的罪恶，并以自己的身世作为例子，启发降巴老人。他向老人介绍：他与央宗，都是二十八、九岁，现在是革命干部，但过去却过了二十多年的奴隶生活。从八岁起，他们就各自从自己父母的手里，接下了世袭的奴隶身份，给日喀则的一家领主种地，冬天赤脚干活，常年吃坏糌粑，一直到二十三、四岁。共产党领导修筑拉萨到日喀则公路的时候，他们才逃出凶恶的农奴主的虎口。修路期间，由于工作人员和解放军同志的帮助，认识到封建农奴制度是使他们受苦的原因。1956年，他们被送到西藏公学去学习。大娃郭杰向降巴老人说：“是共产党才使我们有了今天的幸福，只有共产党才是我们穷人的救星。”他的话深深地打动了老人的心弦，从此，降巴坚决地投入了争取翻身的斗争。
            迎接生产高潮
    随着民主改革的胜利，章达乡掀起了农业生产高潮。由于长期的封建统治，农民群众的守旧习惯相当浓厚。这时，他们便根据党的政策和指示，又引导农民进行农业生产技术上的革命。他们事事做示范，样样搞试验，把群众不愿耕种的三类田开垦出来，种植了一克（合一亩）小麦、一克青稞、一克饲草、一克蔬菜、半克豌豆、半克油菜和半克洋芋。另外，还喂了三头猪、养了十八只鸡。他们在自己的试验田里做出样板，向农民宣传深耕细作的意义，推动了全乡的生产。
    在改变农民不多施肥的习惯上，大娃郭杰和央宗费了很大力气。此地农民原来在每克地上只施底肥五十筐（每筐五十斤）左右，不施追肥，更不利用人粪尿肥。开始大娃郭杰要大家多施底肥的时候，议论纷纭，有的说肥多不出苗，有的说肥多烧死苗。于是，他就向群众说明：肥是庄稼饭，肥多苗才旺。群众认识提高了，施肥的劲头起来了，每克地都施了二百筐以上的底肥。当庄稼长起来需要施追肥的时候，央宗又领导群众连续施了四次追肥，每克地都达到了一百筐。
    最难办的是用人粪作追肥，农民始终不愿意。为了说服群众，大娃郭杰和央宗就背了二百筐人粪，施到自己的小麦试验田里。结果麦苗黄熟时，株高达到一米七、八，穗长三寸，穗粒一般都在八、九十粒，是这一带冒尖的头等庄稼。农民不断地来参观，并后悔自己不该不听乡长的话，表示明年一定照着办。于是全乡家家修厕所，大积人粪肥。
        参加生产、领导生产
    大娃郭杰和央宗最受群众热爱的，还在于他们苦干实干地与群众一起劳动。他们样样农活都是内行，下村工作时，自己背上一小袋糌粑，住到最穷的人家里。无论赶到那里，也无论农民群众在干什么活，他们都插上手干。他们经常通过与群众一起犁地、播种、背粪、拔草等劳动，来宣传党的政策，布置当前的工作。据支部书记傅烈贤与大娃郭杰一起工作四十五天中的统计，他给群众做的活累计起来就有十八天。他与农民协会委员或者互助组长干上半天活，就把工作布置得妥妥贴贴，连工作方法、工作步骤都交代得清清楚楚，然后由农会委员或组长去主持群众开会讨论，既培养了基层干部的工作能力，又收到了事半功倍的效果。这样，使全乡的各项工作，都做得扎扎实实，差不多都走在米林县各乡的前面。
            群众的知心人
    大娃郭杰和央宗处处关心着群众，群众也把他们当成自己的亲人，总喜欢找他们谈心、拉家常。青年人和大娃郭杰在一起干活，劲头特别大，闹得也特别欢，要大娃郭杰教他们唱“社会主义好”，唱“东方红”，要他讲讲如何走到社会主义。老年人几天不见央宗到他们村去走走，总要问个下落，或者跑来看望。4月里，央宗快要临产了，没有下地，老婆婆们总是三天两头跑来看她，有的捎鸡蛋，有的提牛奶，再三叮咛她不要干活了，要吃好一些。临产的前几天，总有一两个老婆婆伴在央宗身边。当她生下一个胖胖的“布母”（女儿）时，前来看望的人更多，像自己办喜事一样。
