Xinhua News Agency, Taiz, 22nd. Aden's Arabic daily newspaper, "Awakening News," recently published an article attacking the谬论 of some people in Aden who are demanding "United Nations protection" for Aden, saying that the current world situation, especially the situation in the Congo, vividly demonstrates the imperialist conspiracy hidden behind "international protection or United Nations guarantees."

The article pointed out that facing the growing national liberation movement and the increasing strength of peaceful forces, imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, is using "fine-sounding terms such as international protection and Point Four Program" to conceal its aggressive conspiracy.

The article continued, the Congo crisis shows the serious consequences of "relying on the United Nations," and also shows how the United Nations has "become merely a cloak to disguise imperialist intentions against the people of the Congo." The African people condemn "the shameful intervention carried out by the United Nations on behalf of imperialism and its agents."

The article also said that in the struggle for the freedom and unity of the people, we must learn from these experiences.

　　争取自由的人民应从刚果事件吸取教训
　　认清“联合国保证”背后的帝国主义阴谋
    新华社塔兹22日电　亚丁的阿拉伯文日报“觉醒报”最近发表一篇文章，抨击亚丁某些人士要求“联合国保护”亚丁的谬论说，当前的世界局势，特别是刚果的局势，生动地证明了隐藏在“国际保护或联合国保证”背后的帝国主义阴谋。
    文章指出，面临着日益壮大的民族解放运动和日益增强的和平力量，帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，利用“国际保护、第四点计划等好听的名词”来掩盖它的侵略阴谋。
    文章接着说，刚果危机表明了“依赖联合国”的严重后果，也表明联合国怎样已经“变成了只是用来掩饰反对刚果人民的帝国主义意图的外衣”。非洲人民谴责“联合国代表帝国主义及其代理人所进行的可耻的干涉”。
    文章又说，在争取人民的自由和统一的斗争中，我们必须吸取这些经验。
