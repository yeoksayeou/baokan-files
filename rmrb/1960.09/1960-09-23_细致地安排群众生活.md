　　Meticulously Arrange the Masses' Lives

The mass movement of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production has unfolded across the rural areas nationwide. The leaping-forward experiences of the past two or three years have taught us that the higher the masses' labor enthusiasm, the more the leading cadres at all levels must care for the masses' lives, in order to mobilize the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses and promote greater development of production. The experience of Leyuan Dining Hall of the Seventh Production Team of Baishazhou Brigade of Dapu Commune in Hengshan County, Hunan, and the news of Liangwu Dining Hall of Liangwu Team of Jiangwei Commune in Wengyuan County, Guangdong, published in this newspaper on August 28th, regarding the development of household production, arrangement of members' lives, and promotion of production in the entire district, once again powerfully illustrate this truth. The cadres in these two places, while focusing their main efforts on leading agricultural production, meticulously arranged the household production of the dining halls, managing the dining halls very well, so that the masses could focus on their work without worries, becoming increasingly enthusiastic and developing production more and more. The Leyuan Dining Hall's household production was well-managed, ensuring that each person had enough fresh vegetables to eat every day, and also storing more than eight thousand catties of dried vegetables. They sold some of the non-staple foods, earning more than one thousand five hundred yuan, which was used to buy oil and salt and to add a set of cooking utensils. Due to the improvement in living standards, the members were very enthusiastic about labor, with forty-eight laborers working full-time every day, of which forty-two reached the standard of "Five-Good" members. Liangwu Team was a grain-deficient team in 1957, with an annual rice yield of only more than sixty thousand catties, with the state supplying more than ten thousand catties of food grain; in 1958, it achieved self-sufficiency in grain; in 1959, it sold more than fifty thousand catties of surplus grain to the state; and this year it will sell even more surplus grain. One of the most important reasons for this is that their lives were well-arranged and the members were very motivated. The experience of the cadres of the Baishazhou Seventh Production Team and the Liangwu Team in meticulously arranging the lives of the masses while leading production deserves to be learned by all rural workers.

To properly arrange the lives of the masses, the first step is to run public dining halls well. To run public dining halls well, the first step is to do a good job in the dining halls' household production. After farmers joined the public dining halls, in addition to the unified distribution of grain by the commune, the various non-staple foods mainly rely on the dining halls' own production. For this reason, the dining hall must have its own vegetable garden, planting vegetables on time and according to the season, planting both coarse and fine vegetables, and having both what to eat and what to store, to ensure that members have vegetables to eat all year round. The dining hall must also raise pigs, raise fish, raise chickens, geese, and ducks, and plant oil crops. The conditions of Liangwu Dining Hall and Leyuan Dining Hall are not particularly superior. Originally, 40% of the land of Liangwu Team was "waiting-for-rain fields" that lacked water, with low yields and not enough grain to eat. During the advanced cooperative, 70% of the members were overdrawn households. Leyuan Dining Hall even had to borrow money monthly for oil and salt this spring. The state and the commune did not provide any special care to these two dining halls. The main reason they did well is that the cadres had a deep understanding of the important role of doing a good job in the dining hall's household production, and made meticulous and thoughtful arrangements. Of course, having a comprehensively developed household production only provides the material basis for running the dining hall well, and the possibility of running the dining hall well. To turn this possibility into reality, it is also necessary to further improve management work and make full use of all favorable conditions. For example, on the basis of establishing a developed household production, Liangwu Dining Hall also implemented a set of meticulous dining hall management system. In terms of food management, they insisted on implementing a planned grain consumption system that quantifies by person, assigns quotas to households, provides grain to the dining hall, and allows savings to be retained; implemented a simple pre-ordering system; frequently changed the variety of food; and provided special care to members during the New Year and festivals according to local customs. In terms of financial accounts, they implemented democratic management, achieving daily clearing and monthly settlement, clear accounts, posted bills on the wall, so that everyone was informed, happy, and comfortable. They worked hard to make the dining hall a warm and large family for the members, who therefore loved the dining hall and the collective even more.

Developing the dining hall's household production requires occupying some land, fertilizer, and labor, which creates some contradictions with large-scale collective production. However, as long as the cadres are told the reasons, leadership is strengthened, and reasonable arrangements are made, the contradictions can not only be resolved, but the two aspects can also complement each other and promote each other. The Leyuan Dining Hall's household production was not well-managed in the past, mainly because some cadres were afraid that developing household production would affect large-scale collective production, and that they would "lose the watermelon while grasping the sesame seeds." In March this year, the brigade's general branch secretary went to the dining hall and discovered this situation, immediately convened a meeting of all team and group cadres to specifically discuss this issue. By comparing and calculating accounts, the cadres' ideological understanding was unified. Then, cadres were sent to the dining hall to help organize a leading group for household production. They stipulated that in addition to the original vegetable garden, land reclamation and gaps should be used as much as possible to plant vegetables and feed; 80% of the household fertilizer should be handed over to the brigade for use, and 20% should be retained for the dining hall's use; and labor should be used as much as possible during the members' spare time and auxiliary labor. Using this method to resolve the contradictions in the cadres' thinking, the dining hall's household production quickly developed from a few pigs and chickens to thirty pigs, hundreds of poultry, and more than thirty acres of vegetable garden, and also raised more than one thousand fish. Due to the development of poultry and livestock, the accumulated fertilizer could not be used up by the dining hall, and forty to fifty loads were supplied to the production team every month, greatly promoting the production of the large collective.

The members live a collective life centered on the public dining hall in the people's commune, and their basic needs are met. Some different and reasonable requests of different members should also be actively taken care of as much as possible. This is how the economic work of Liangwu Team was done. They thought of the hemp used by members to make shoes; they thought of some people wanting to smoke; they thought of pregnant women wanting to eat ginger; and they also thought of members having guests at home for dinner, and old people, children, women in confinement, and patients needing to eat different meals. These things do not require much effort, but they are very important and convenient for the members. They should be thought of one by one with a meticulous spirit, and gradually solved by relying on the strength of the people's commune and according to the specific conditions of each commune.

Going deep into the grassroots, adhering to eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses is the decisive condition for leading production well, and it is also the decisive condition for arranging life well. Farmers have gone from small pots and stoves in individual households to large pots and stoves in public dining halls, which is a huge change in lifestyle. For the stewards of the masses' lives—the rural cadres—how to adapt to this change and arrange the lives of the members well is still a new topic. Going from not knowing to knowing, from not being able to do it to being able to do it, requires a process of going deep into reality and becoming familiar with the situation. Therefore, it is necessary to go deep down, eat together, live together, and become one with the masses in order to understand the needs of the masses, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, comprehensively arrange the lives of the members, and truly run the dining hall well. Before May this year, the eight public dining halls of Qimeitang Brigade of Lianghua Commune in Huiyang County, Guangdong, had very few green vegetables and no miscellaneous grains to adjust the meals, and the variety of dishes was not large. At that time, most of the brigade cadres ate in the brigade headquarters, and did not have a personal experience of the quality of the masses' meals, and did not understand the problems of the dining hall; some cadres did not have a sufficient understanding of the important significance of arranging life, and although they ate in the dining hall, they did not pay enough attention to the problems in the dining hall and the opinions of the masses; individual dining halls were sabotaged by bad elements and were run even worse. Later, all the cadres went deep down, insisted on the "Four Togethers" with the masses, and established a food management committee with cadres, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants as the core. The cadres took the lead in planting vegetables and chopping firewood, and developing household production. After a month of efforts, all the dining halls planted vegetables and raised pigs, chickens, and ducks. Starting in July, most of the dining halls achieved one to two catties of vegetables per person per day, and some dining halls also improved and expanded the dining hall in a simple way, which the members were very satisfied with.

Arranging the lives of the masses is an important task and a complex task. On the one hand, it is necessary to strengthen ideological education and promote the spirit of hard work and thrift in building the country. On the other hand, it is necessary to enthusiastically care for the lives of the masses and arrange the lives of the masses as well as possible. This requires our style to become more and more thorough, and our work to become more and more meticulous. Just as we have already done in leading production, we must further meticulously arrange the lives of the members, arouse greater revolutionary enthusiasm among the masses, and devote ourselves wholeheartedly to the movement of vigorously developing grain production and agriculture to increase production and practice economy.

### 细致地安排群众生活

　　细致地安排群众生活
    大办农业、大办粮食的群众运动，已经在全国农村普遍展开。两三年来的跃进经验告诉我们：群众的劳动热情越高，各级领导干部越要关心群众的生活，以便调动广大群众的劳动积极性，促进生产的更大发展。湖南衡山县大浦公社白沙洲大队第七生产队乐园食堂和本报8　月28日发表的广东翁源县江尾公社梁屋小队梁屋食堂发展家底生产、安排好社员的生活、推进全区生产的新闻，再一次极有力地说明了这个道理。这两个地方的干部，一面以主要力量领导农业生产，一面细致地安排食堂的家底生产，把食堂办得很好，使群众生活无牵无挂，干劲越来越大，生产越来越发展。乐园食堂的家底生产搞得好，保证每人每天有足够的新鲜蔬菜吃，还储存了八千多斤干菜；他们出卖了部分副食品，收入一千五百多元，用作买油盐钱，并添置了一套炊具。由于生活的改善，社员劳动积极性很高，四十八个劳动力天天满勤，其中四十二个达到“五好”社员的标准。梁屋小队1957年还是个缺粮队，全年稻谷产量只有六万多斤，由国家供应口粮一万多斤；1958年达到粮食自给有余；1959年卖给国家余粮五万多斤；今年将要卖出更多的余粮。这当中一个最主要的原因，也是他们的生活安排得好，社员干劲很高。白沙洲第七生产队和梁屋小队干部这种在领导生产的同时深入细致地安排群众生活的经验，值得全体农村工作人员学习。
    好好安排群众生活，首先要办好公共食堂。要办好公共食堂，首先要搞好食堂的家底生产。农民参加公共食堂以后，除了粮食由公社统一分配外，各种副食品主要的都要依靠食堂自己生产。为此，食堂必须有自己的菜地，按时按节种植蔬菜，种粗菜也种细菜，有吃的还要有储存的，保证社员一年四季有菜吃。食堂还必须养猪、养鱼，养鸡、鹅、鸭，种植油料。梁屋食堂和乐园食堂的条件并不特别优越，梁屋小队原来有四成土地是缺水的“望天田”，产量很低，粮食不够吃，高级社时有70％的社员是超支户。乐园食堂在今年春季连油盐钱都要月月借支。国家和公社对这两个食堂也没有任何特殊照顾。他们所以办得好，主要由于干部对搞好食堂家底生产的重要作用有深刻的认识，并且进行了细致周到的安排。当然，有了全面发展的家底生产，只是有了办好食堂的物质基础，有了办好食堂的可能性，要想把这种可能变成现实，还要进一步做好管理工作，把一切有利条件充分运用起来。例如梁屋食堂在建立了发达的家底生产的基础上，又实行了一套细致的食堂管理制度。他们在伙食管理上，坚持执行了以人定量、指标到户、粮食到堂、凭票吃饭、节约归己的计划用粮制度；实行简便的预订饭制度；饭菜经常变换花样；根据当地习惯，逢年过节对社员加以特别照顾。在财务账目方面，他们实行了民主管理，做到日清月结，账目清楚，账单上墙，人人有底，乐意舒心。他们努力把食堂办成了社员的温暖大家庭，社员因此更加热爱食堂、热爱集体。
    发展食堂家底生产，需要占用一些土地、肥料和劳力，这和大集体生产之间是有一些矛盾的。但是，只要向干部讲通道理，加强领导，合理安排，矛盾不但可以解决，两方面还能相辅相成，互相促进。乐园食堂原来的家底生产没有搞好，主要因为有些干部怕发展家底生产会影响大集体生产，怕抓了“芝麻”丢了“西瓜”。今年3月间，大队总支书记下到这个食堂，发现了这种情况，立即召开全体队、组干部会议，专门讨论这个问题。通过对比算账的方法，统一了干部的思想认识。接着派干部到食堂帮助组织家底生产领导小组。他们规定：除原有菜地外，尽可能利用开荒和空隙地种植蔬菜和饲料；家肥的80％交大队用，20％留食堂用；劳力尽量利用社员的业余时间和辅助劳力。用这样的方法解决了干部思想中的矛盾，这个食堂的家底生产很快由几只猪、几只鸡发展到三十头猪、几百只家禽、三十多亩菜地，还养了一千多尾鱼。由于家禽家畜的发展，积的肥料食堂用不完，每月还供给生产队四、五十担，大大促进了大集体的生产。
    社员在人民公社中，过着以公共食堂为中心的集体生活，他们的基本要求得到了满足。对于不同社员的一些不同的合理要求，也应当尽可能地加以主动的照顾。梁屋小队的经济工作就是这样作的。社员作鞋用麻，他们想到了；有些人要吸烟，他们想到了；孕妇要吃姜，他们也想到了；社员家里来客要吃饭，老人小孩、产妇、病人要吃不同一些的饭，他们也想到了。这些事情费力不多，对社员却很重要、很方便，应该以体贴入微的精神，一件一件都想到，而且依靠人民公社的力量，根据各公社的具体条件，逐步加以解决。
    深入基层，坚持和群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，是领导好生产的决定性条件，同样是安排好生活的决定性条件。农民由一家一户的小锅小灶到公共食堂的大锅大灶，这在生活方式上是一个极大的变化；对于群众生活的管家人——农村干部来说，如何适应这个变化，安排好社员生活，还是一个新的课题。从不懂到懂，从不会做到会做，这里要有一个深入实际熟悉情况的过程，因此，必须深入下去，和群众吃在一起，住在一起，打成一片，才能了解群众的要求，集中群众的智慧，全面地安排社员的生活，真正把食堂办好。广东惠阳县梁化公社齐眉塘大队的八个公共食堂，在今年5月以前，青菜很少，也没有杂粮调剂伙食，饭菜花样不多。当时大队干部大部分在队部吃饭，对群众吃的好坏没有切身感受，对食堂问题不摸底；部分干部对安排生活的重要意义认识不足，虽在食堂吃饭，对食堂里的问题和群众意见也不够注意；个别食堂受到坏分子的破坏，办得更差。后来全体干部都深入下去，坚持和群众“四同”，并建立了以干部和贫农、下中农为核心的伙食管理委员会，干部带头种菜打柴，发展家底生产，经过一个月的努力，各个食堂都种了菜，养了猪、鸡、鸭，从7月份开始，大部食堂就做到了每人每天有一两斤蔬菜，有些食堂还因陋就简地改善和扩大了饭厅，社员都很满意。
    安排群众生活是一项重要的工作，也是一项复杂的工作。一方面要加强思想教育工作，发扬艰苦朴素、勤俭建国的精神，一方面又要热情地关怀群众的生活，尽可能地好好安排群众生活。这就需要我们的作风必须愈来愈深入，工作必须愈做愈细致，像在领导生产上已经做的那样，进一步细致地安排好社员的生活，鼓起群众更大的革命干劲，全力投入大办粮食、大办农业的增产节约运动。
