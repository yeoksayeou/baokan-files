    Mao Zedong Thought Is the Banner of Victory for the Chinese People's Great Revolution
    —Celebrating the Publication of Volume IV of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong
    Volume IV of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong has been published. This volume collects the important works of Comrade Mao Zedong from the period after Japan's surrender in 1945 to the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. This period is commonly referred to as the Third Domestic Revolutionary War period or the Chinese People's Liberation War period. In this new period of the Chinese People's Great Revolution, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people finally and completely overthrew the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, established a people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and completed the national democratic revolutionary cause of the Chinese people for more than a century. During this period, Comrade Mao Zedong further integrated the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, and continuously enriched and developed the theory and strategy of the Chinese revolution. The victory achieved by the Chinese people under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong is another great victory in human history after the great October Revolution and the victory of the anti-fascist war. This victory created a new epoch in Chinese history, opened a large gap in the eastern front of imperialism, greatly strengthened the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and once again changed the face of the world. The victory of Marxism-Leninism in such a large country in the East proved with irrefutable facts that Marxism-Leninism is an invincible universal truth applicable everywhere.
    After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese landlord and bourgeois ruling clique, represented by Chiang Kai-shek, attempted to usurp the fruits of victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Japanese imperialism was driven away by the Chinese people, but American imperialism barged in. The Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique wanted to make China, under the control of American imperialism, still a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country under the dictatorship of the landlords and big bourgeoisie. This was a reactionary, counter-revolutionary road. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people resolutely opposed the reactionary, counter-revolutionary road taken by Chiang Kai-shek, resolutely opposed Chiang Kai-shek's re-selling of China to American imperialism, wanted to defend the fruits of victory of the Chinese people, and advocated the establishment of a new China led by the proletariat and the broad masses of the people. This was a road of people's liberation and revolution. The decisive struggle between these two destinies and two futures facing China is the historical background of Volume IV of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong.
    The Chinese people had experienced decades of civil war and eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Therefore, after the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people hoped for domestic peace and opposed Chiang Kai-shek's re-launching of the counter-revolutionary civil war. The Chinese Communist Party saw through Chiang Kai-shek's plot to prepare for a counter-revolutionary civil war, but still made great efforts and patience to seek ways to avoid civil war and achieve peace. For this purpose, Comrade Mao Zedong personally went to Chongqing to negotiate with Chiang Kai-shek for more than a month. The Chinese Communist Party put forward a plan to achieve domestic peace. When one plan was rejected, another plan was put forward. When the second plan was rejected, a third and fourth plan were put forward, repeating this process many times, and making possible concessions without harming the fundamental interests of the people. This attitude of the Chinese Communist Party, doing all that was humanly possible, won the sympathy of the people across the country. Under the pressure of the people, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to sign an agreement with the Chinese Communist Party on "peaceful national construction." However, Chiang Kai-shek stubbornly refused to recognize the legitimate status of the People's Army and the democratic government in the Liberated Areas, and was unwilling to reach an agreement with the Chinese Communist Party on the issue of the People's Army and the Liberated Areas. Subsequently, the Chinese Communist Party and other parties held a Political Consultative Conference with the Kuomintang and adopted the "Program for Peaceful National Construction" and the five principles for reorganizing the National Government. All these agreements were the result of the utmost efforts of the Chinese Communist Party and the people across the country.
    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The agreements that have been reached are only things on paper. Things on paper are not the same as things in reality. Facts have proved that it takes great effort to turn them into reality." Therefore, despite the agreements on peace, we must remain highly vigilant against the Kuomintang's conspiracy to undermine peace.
    In short, when we conduct peace negotiations, we must not only do everything possible to strive for peace, but also constantly expose the enemy's trickery of "peace" so that the broad masses of the people can recognize the true face of the enemy; we must not only adhere to principles and defend the fundamental interests of the people, but also allow certain necessary concessions under the principle of not harming the fundamental interests of the people; we must neither lightly believe the enemy's promises nor fear the enemy's threats; we must insist on the agreements that have been reached in the negotiations, and at the same time, we must guard against the enemy's sudden attacks to sabotage the agreements, and resolutely fight back when the enemy attacks.
    The reactionaries are the least hopeful for peace. In July 1946, Chiang Kai-shek tore up the agreements of the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the Political Consultative Conference, and launched a full-scale attack on the Liberated Areas. In this way, Chiang Kai-shek fully exposed his extremely cruel and extremely sinister face, and placed himself in a completely isolated position among the people across the country. On the revolutionary side, the broadest people's democratic united front, led by the proletariat and its party and based on the worker-peasant alliance, was formed, which was in an unprecedentedly favorable political position and occupied an overwhelming advantage. This change in the political situation fully confirmed the conclusion of Comrade Mao Zedong's specific class analysis of Chinese society at that time using Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Mao Zedong's conclusion armed the people across the country spiritually and greatly enhanced the confidence of the people across the country in winning the victory of the revolution. In the first year of the Liberation War (July 1946 to June 1947), Chiang Kai-shek, with the massive assistance of American imperialism, was temporarily in a position of strategic offensive, while the People's Liberation Army was in a position of strategic defense. The central task of our Party in this stage was to thoroughly smash Chiang Kai-shek's armed offensive with self-defense warfare. In the many important documents written by Comrade Mao Zedong during this period, he clearly pointed out the road to victory in the revolutionary war, criticized the right-leaning opportunist ideas and the theory of weapons that overestimated the enemy's strength and dared not fight the enemy, and put forward the operational policy of the People's Liberation Army and the policy of making the Liberation War a widespread people's war. Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly analyzed the domestic and international situation and put forward the famous thesis that "all reactionaries are paper tigers." Comrade Mao Zedong believed that, in essence, from the trend of historical development, and from the overall situation of the struggle, all seemingly powerful reactionaries must be regarded as paper tigers. The revolutionary people have reason to despise them and establish their own strategic thinking from this point of view. While strategically despising the enemy, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that we must also tactically take the enemy seriously. The operational method of "concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy one by one" that he put forward embodies the principle of taking the enemy seriously tactically in military issues. The implementation of this operational method in the Liberation War, in the situation where the enemy was strong and we were weak, and the enemy was large and we were small, transformed the enemy's strategic advantage over our army into our army's advantage over the enemy in campaigns or battles, achieving the goal of continuously annihilating the enemy's vital forces, and finally enabling the People's Liberation Army to transform from defense to offense, while the enemy transformed from offense to defense.
    In December 1947, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "The Present Situation and Our Tasks": "The Chinese People's Liberation Army has reversed the counter-revolutionary wheel of American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang on this land of China, leading it to the road of ruin, and promoted its own revolutionary wheel, leading it to the road of victory. This is a historical turning point." In this situation of great development of the revolutionary situation, Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out: "Now the enemy has been completely isolated. However, the enemy's isolation does not equal our victory. If we make mistakes in policy, we still cannot win." To achieve the victory of the revolution, we must put all the Party's policies on the right track. At the same time, to ensure the correct implementation of the Party's policies, we also need to further strengthen the discipline of the Party and the revolutionary ranks and overcome certain states of indiscipline and disorganization. In this stage, the content of Comrade Mao Zedong's many works is related to the Party's policies and organizational lines in all aspects, including the ten major military principles, the three major economic programs, the general line and general policy of land reform, the revolutionary united front, the people's government, the Party's construction, and working methods. The series of policies and principles put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong ensured the victory of the revolution nationwide.
    After the victory of the three largest campaigns with decisive significance in the autumn and winter of 1948 to the spring of 1949, namely the Liaoshen Campaign, the Huaihai Campaign, and the Pingjin Campaign, the Chinese People's Liberation War entered the final stage of victory, and the victory of the Chinese revolution was a foregone conclusion. At this time, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, in order to save itself from destruction, played a new peace conspiracy, attempting to preserve the remaining forces of the Kuomintang government, gain a respite, and then make a comeback to extinguish the revolution. Despite this, the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, in order to quickly end the war, achieve true peace, and reduce the suffering of the people, still agreed to hold negotiations with the Kuomintang under conditions that were truly beneficial to the people. At the same time, Comrade Mao Zedong, with the revolutionary firmness and thoroughness of a Marxist-Leninist, timely exposed the tricks of the reactionaries, and criticized the illusions of peace compromise spread by the right-wing elements of the bourgeoisie and the so-called "third road." Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the great call to "carry the revolution through to the end." He pointed out that the question facing the Chinese people is "to carry the revolution through to the end, or to abandon the revolution halfway? If we want to carry the revolution through to the end, we must use revolutionary methods to resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate all reactionary forces, ...and establish a republic of people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance throughout the country." To carry the revolution through to the end means to completely eliminate the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, and at the same time prepare to transform China's bourgeois democratic revolution into a socialist revolution. It was at this time that Comrade Mao Zedong creatively put forward a series of principles and policies on the transformation of the Chinese revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and the essay "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" theoretically elaborated on the principles and policies of the revolutionary transformation and put these tasks before the whole Party and the people of the whole country. The Chinese revolution is advancing in the direction pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong.
    China's new democratic revolution is a typical example of a bourgeois democratic revolution led by the proletariat. In his book "Two Tactics of Social Democracy in the Democratic Revolution," Lenin put forward the basic strategic principles of the party in the new type of bourgeois democratic revolution: the proletariat can and should become the leader of the bourgeois democratic revolution; when the revolution is ripe, the armed uprising of the people is the most important means to overthrow the autocratic system and win the democratic republic system; the proletarian party must do its best to prepare to transform the bourgeois democratic revolution into a socialist revolution. These Marxist-Leninist principles have been creatively applied and developed in the Chinese revolutionary movement led by the Chinese Communist Party. Comrade Mao Zedong's works, especially the now published Volume IV of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, centrally express this creative application and development. The Chinese revolution under the leadership of the proletariat and its party is a truly great people's revolution. In the Third Domestic Revolutionary War in China, the Chinese Communist Party resolutely implemented the great policy of "boldly mobilizing the masses, expanding the people's forces, and defeating the invaders and building a new China under the leadership of our Party" put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong, truly mobilizing the broadest masses of the people, mainly the workers and peasants who account for the largest majority of the population, and at the same time, mobilizing the revolutionary progressive intellectuals to join the revolutionary struggle. This has brought the depth and breadth of the Chinese revolution to an unprecedented level.
    In his article "Cast Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle," Comrade Mao summarized the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in dealing with the people's cause and the logic of the cause of people's revolution. The former is: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until extinction"; the latter is: "Struggle, fail, struggle again, fail again, struggle again, until victory." The history of the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism and its running dogs for more than a hundred years, the history of the Chinese Communist Party's leadership of the new democratic revolution for twenty-eight years, and the history of the four-year Liberation War have confirmed that this is the case. Contradictions are irreconcilable, and the only way to resolve contradictions is through struggle. Whoever does not recognize this problem will fall into the quagmire of opportunism and revisionism. Class struggle has various forms. Revolutionary armed struggle cannot be arbitrarily carried out at any time or place based solely on subjective assumptions. To hold revolutionary armed struggle, it is necessary to estimate the objective and subjective possible conditions and estimate the degree of maturity of the revolutionary crisis at that time and place. It is wrong to arbitrarily hold armed struggle without estimating these conditions and being unwilling to carry out the arduous work of accumulating revolutionary forces. However, when the revolutionary crisis has matured, and in places where it has matured, when the ruling class uses violence to suppress the revolution, and the strength of the revolutionary class has grown to the point that, as Lenin said, "it is able to launch powerful mass revolutionary actions sufficient to overthrow (or destroy) the old government," whether to dare to take up arms to carry out resolute struggle and overthrow reactionary rule is a fundamental principle related to whether one is loyal to the interests of the people and whether one adheres to the revolutionary stance. In his political report at the Eighth National Congress of the Party, Comrade Liu Shaoqi said when talking about the Third Domestic Revolutionary War in our country: "Contrary to the reactionaries, the people are not war-loving. ...But when the people are forced to take up arms, it is entirely correct for the people to take up arms. Opposing the people from doing so and asking the people to yield to the attacking enemy is an opportunist line. Here, whether to take the revolutionary line or the opportunist line is a major issue related to whether 600 million people should seize power when the time is ripe." It is precisely because our Party, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, has adopted a revolutionary line irreconcilable with opportunism, dared to struggle, and dared to win, that we have today's People's Republic of China with people's democratic dictatorship.
    Just as we are celebrating the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the publication of Volume IV of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong has added extra splendor to our festival. We warmly celebrate this great festival and warmly celebrate the publication of this great Marxist-Leninist work representing the crystallization of the experience of the victory of the Chinese revolution. We believe that due to the publication of Volume IV of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, a new upsurge in studying Marxism-Leninism and studying Mao Zedong's works will be formed throughout the country. All our cadres and the people of the whole country will, through this study, further understand and grasp Marxism-Leninism, further understand and grasp Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of China, improve their theoretical level and ideological and political level, use this great ideological weapon, give play to the spirit of combining soaring vigor with scientific analysis, strive to promote the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, strengthen the struggle against imperialism and against modern revisionism, strengthen the struggle to defend world peace, strive to build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and technology.
    Let us hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advance victoriously!

    毛泽东思想是中国人民大革命胜利的旗帜
　　——庆祝《毛泽东选集》第四卷出版
    《毛泽东选集》第四卷出版了。这一卷收集了毛泽东同志从一九四五年日本投降以后到一九四九年中华人民共和国成立以前这个时期的重要著作。这个时期，我们平常叫作第三次国内革命战争时期或中国人民解放战争时期。在这个中国人民大革命的新时期，中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下，最后地彻底地推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治，建立了无产阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的共和国，完成了一百多年来中国人民的民族民主革命事业。在这个时期中，毛泽东同志进一步地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践结合起来，继续丰富和发展了关于中国革命的理论和策略。中国人民在毛泽东同志指导下取得的胜利，是继伟大的十月革命和反法西斯战争胜利以后，人类历史上又一次的伟大胜利。这个胜利创造了中国历史的新纪元，在帝国主义的东方战线上打开了一个大缺口，大大加强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，再一次地改变了世界的面貌。马克思列宁主义在东方这样一个大国中的胜利，以无可争辩的事实，证明了马克思列宁主义是无往而不胜、放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。
    抗日战争结束后，以蒋介石为代表的中国大地主大资产阶级统治集团，企图篡夺抗日战争的胜利果实。日本帝国主义被中国人民打跑了，但是，美国帝国主义闯进来。蒋介石统治集团就是要使中国在美帝国主义的支配下，仍旧成为大地主大资产阶级专政的半殖民地半封建的国家。这是一条反动的、反革命的道路。中国共产党和中国人民坚决反对蒋介石所走的这条反动的、反革命的道路，坚决地反对蒋介石把中国重新出卖给美帝国主义，要保卫中国人民的胜利果实，主张建立一个无产阶级领导的、人民大众的新中国。这是一条人民解放的、革命的道路。摆在中国面前的这两种命运、两个前途的决定胜败的斗争，就是《毛泽东选集》第四卷的历史背景。
    中国人民经历过几十年的内战，又经历了八年的抗日战争。因此，在抗日战争结束以后，中国人民曾经希望国内和平，反对蒋介石重新发动反革命的内战。中国共产党看穿了蒋介石准备反革命的内战阴谋，但仍然用了极大的努力和耐心寻求避免内战和实现和平的途径。为了这个目的，毛泽东同志还亲自到重庆同蒋介石进行了一个多月的谈判。中国共产党提出了实现国内和平的方案，一个方案被拒绝了，又提出第二个方案，第二个方案被拒绝了，又提出了第三个、第四个方案，这样反复了多次，并且在不损害人民根本利益的前提下，作了可能的让步。中国共产党这种仁至义尽的态度，赢得了全国人民的同情。在人民的压力下，蒋介石被迫同中国共产党签订了“和平建国”的协议。但是，蒋介石始终顽固地拒绝承认人民军队和解放区民主政权的合法地位，不愿意在人民军队和解放区的问题上同中国共产党达成协议。随后，中国共产党和其它党派又同国民党举行了政治协商会议，通过了“和平建国纲领”以及改组国民政府的五项原则。所有这些协议，都是中国共产党和全国人民极力争取的结果。
    毛泽东同志指出：“已经达成的协议，还只是纸上的东西。纸上的东西并不等于现实的东西。事实证明，要把它变成现实的东西，还要经过很大的努力。”因此，尽管有了关于和平的协议，仍然要对国民党破坏和平的阴谋保持高度警惕。
    总之，我们在进行和平谈判的时候，既要尽一切可能争取和平，又要不断揭露敌人玩弄“和平”的骗局，使广大人民群众认清敌人的真面目；既要坚持原则，保卫人民的根本利益，又容许在不损害人民根本利益的原则下作某些必要的让步；既不轻信敌人的诺言，也不畏惧敌人的恫吓；要坚持在谈判中已经达成的协议，同时要防备敌人破坏协议的突然袭击，并且在敌人进攻的时候要予以坚决还击。
    反动派是最不希望和平的。一九四六年七月，蒋介石撕毁了国共两党谈判和政治协商会议的各项协议，发动了对解放区的全面进攻。这样，蒋介石就充分地暴露了自己的极端残忍、极端阴险的面貌，在全国人民中使自己陷于完全孤立的地位。而在革命方面，则形成了以无产阶级及其政党为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的最广泛的人民民主统一战线，在政治上处于空前有利的地位，占有压倒的优势。这种政治形势的变化，完全证实了毛泽东同志运用马克思列宁主义对当时中国社会所作的具体的阶级分析的结论。毛泽东同志的这种结论，在精神上武装了全国人民，极大地提高了全国人民夺取革命胜利的信心。在解放战争的第一年中（一九四六年七月至一九四七年六月），蒋介石在美帝国主义的大量援助下，暂时处在战略进攻的地位，而人民解放军则处在战略防御的地位。我们党在这个阶段的中心任务，就是用自卫战争彻底粉碎蒋介石的武装进攻。毛泽东同志在这一个时期所写作的许多重要的文件里，明确地指出了革命战争胜利的道路，批判了那些把敌人力量估计过高、不敢同敌人战斗的右倾机会主义思想和唯武器论，提出了人民解放军的作战方针和使解放战争成为广泛的人民战争的方针。毛泽东同志深刻地分析了国内外形势，提出了“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的著名论点。毛泽东同志认为，从本质看，从历史发展的趋向看，从斗争的全局看，必须把一切貌似强大的反动派，统统看成纸老虎，革命的人民有理由藐视他们，并且从这一点来建立自己的战略思想。在战略上藐视敌人的同时，毛泽东同志又指出，还要在战术上重视敌人。他所提出的“集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”的作战方法，就是在军事问题上体现了战术上重视敌人的原则。这个作战方法在解放战争中的贯彻执行，在敌强我弱、敌大我小的形势下，把敌军对我军在战略上的优势，改变为我军对敌军在战役或战斗上的优势，达到了不断歼灭敌人有生力量的目的，终于使人民解放军由防御转变为进攻，而敌人则由进攻转变为防御。
    一九四七年十二月，毛泽东同志在《目前形势和我们的任务》中指出：“中国人民解放军已经在中国这块土地上扭转了美国帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮的反革命车轮，使之走向复灭的道路，推进了自己的革命车轮，使之走向胜利的道路。这是一个历史的转折点。”在革命形势大发展的这种形势下，毛泽东同志又指出：“现在敌人已经彻底孤立了。但是，敌人的孤立并不就等于我们的胜利。我们如果在政策上犯了错误，还是不能取得胜利。”要取得革命的胜利，必须使党的政策全部走上正轨。同时，为了保证党的政策的正确执行，还需要进一步地加强党和革命队伍的纪律性，克服某些无纪律状态和无组织状态。在这个阶段中，毛泽东同志很多著作的内容，都是有关党的各方面的政策和组织路线的，其中包括十大军事原则、三大经济纲领、土地改革的总路线和总政策、革命统一战线、人民政权、党的建设和工作方法等等方面。毛泽东同志提出的这一系列的政策和原则，保证了革命在全国范围内的胜利。
    一九四八年秋冬到一九四九年春的辽沈、淮海、平津这三个具有决定意义的最大战役胜利结束以后，中国人民解放战争就进入了最后胜利的阶段，中国革命的胜利已成定局。在这个时候，蒋介石反动集团为了挽救自己的灭亡而玩弄了新的和平阴谋，企图保存国民党政府的残余力量，取得喘息时间，然后卷土重来，扑灭革命。虽然如此，以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党为了迅速结束战争，实现真正的和平，减少人民群众的痛苦，还是赞成在真正有利于人民的条件下同国民党举行谈判。同时，毛泽东同志以马克思列宁主义者的革命坚定性和彻底性，及时地揭露了反动派的骗局，并且批判了资产阶级右翼分子散布的和平妥协的幻想和所谓“第三条道路”的主张。毛泽东同志提出了“将革命进行到底”的伟大号召。他指出，摆在中国人民面前的问题，“是将革命进行到底呢，还是使革命半途而废呢？如果要使革命进行到底，那就是用革命的方法，坚决彻底干净全部地消灭一切反动势力，……在全国范围内建立无产阶级领导的以工农联盟为主体的人民民主专政的共和国”。将革命进行到底，这就是说要彻底消灭帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，同时准备使中国的资产阶级民主革命转变为社会主义革命。正是在这个时候，毛泽东同志创造性地提出了关于中国革命转变问题的一系列方针和政策。毛泽东同志在党的七届二中全会上的报告和《论人民民主专政》的论文，对于革命转变问题的方针和政策，从理论上作了详细的阐述，并且把这些任务提在全党和全国人民面前。中国革命正是沿着毛泽东同志指出的方向前进的。
    中国的新民主主义革命，是无产阶级领导的资产阶级民主革命的一个典型。列宁在《社会民主党在民主革命中的两个策略》一书中，提出了党在新型的资产阶级民主革命中的基本策略原理是：无产阶级能够而且应当成为资产阶级民主革命的领导者；在革命成熟了的时机，人民武装起义是推翻专制制度和争取民主共和制度的最重要的手段；无产阶级政党必须极力准备使资产阶级民主革命开始转变为社会主义革命。这些马克思列宁主义的原理，在中国共产党领导的中国革命运动中都得到了创造性的运用和发展。毛泽东同志的著作，特别是现在出版的《毛泽东选集》第四卷，集中地表达了这种创造性的运用和发展。在无产阶级及其政党领导下的中国革命是真正的人民大革命。在中国第三次国内革命战争中，中国共产党坚决地贯彻执行了毛泽东同志所提出的“放手发动群众，壮大人民力量，在我们党的领导下，打败侵略者，建设新中国”的伟大方针，把最广大的人民群众，主要是占人口最大多数的工人农民真正发动起来，同时，也把革命的进步的知识分子发动起来，投入革命斗争。这就使中国革命的深度和广度，都达到了前所未有的程度。
    毛泽东同志在《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》这篇文章中，总结了帝国主义和一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑和人民革命事业的逻辑，前者是：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡”；后者是：“斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利”。一百多年中国人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争的历史，二十八年来中国共产党领导新民主主义革命的历史，四年解放战争的历史，证实了事实就是这样。矛盾是不可调和的，解决矛盾只有斗争，谁不认识这个问题，谁就会滚入机会主义和修正主义的泥坑。阶级斗争有各种各样的形式。革命的武装斗争，并不是单凭主观的设想，在任何时间、任何地方都可以任意进行的。举行革命的武装斗争，必须估计到客观和主观的可能条件，估计到当时当地革命危机成熟的程度。不估计这些条件，不愿意进行艰苦的积蓄革命力量的工作，而任意举行武装斗争，这是错误的。但是在革命危机已经成熟的时候，已经成熟的地方，当统治阶级使用暴力镇压革命，而革命阶级的力量已经壮大到如列宁所说的那样，“能够发动足以打倒（或摧毁）旧政府的强大的群众革命行动”的情况下，敢不敢拿起武器进行坚决斗争，推翻反动统治，是关系到是否忠实于人民利益、是否坚持革命立场的根本原则问题。刘少奇同志在党的第八次全国代表大会上的政治报告中谈到我国的第三次国内革命战争时说：“同反动派相反，人民不是好战的。……但是当着人民被迫而不能不拿起武器的时候，人民拿起武器来是完全正确的。反对人民这样做，要求人民向进攻的敌人屈服，这就是机会主义的路线。在这里，究竟采取革命的路线，还是采取机会主义的路线，这是关系到六亿人民在时机成熟的时候是否应当取得政权的大问题。”正是因为我们的党在毛泽东同志的领导下采取了同机会主义不可调和的革命路线，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，才有了今天的人民民主专政的中华人民共和国。
    正当中华人民共和国成立十一周年的时候，《毛泽东选集》第四卷的出版，为我们的节日分外增加了光彩。我们热烈庆祝这个伟大的节日，热烈庆祝这一部代表中国革命胜利经验结晶的、伟大的马克思列宁主义著作的出版。我们相信，由于《毛泽东选集》第四卷的出版，将会在全国形成一个学习马克思列宁主义、学习毛泽东著作的新高潮。我们全体干部和全国人民，将通过这种学习，进一步领会和掌握马克思列宁主义，进一步领会和掌握马克思列宁主义普遍真理和中国具体实际相结合的毛泽东思想，提高理论水平和思想政治水平，运用这一伟大的思想武器，发挥冲天干劲和科学分析相结合的精神，努力推进社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，加强反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义的斗争，加强保卫世界和平的斗争，为把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
    让我们高举毛泽东思想的旗帜胜利前进！
