    The Unified Mirror – A Meeting with a Chinese Female Conductor
    Vietnam, Qu Huijin
I met you on the Sino-Vietnamese international train. Between the two carriages, we chatted as intimately and harmoniously as family. The train sped through the night, the cold wind howled outside the window, and you cast a kind gaze upon me, your eyes fixed on the South. You handed me a small mirror, your face a little excited; a map of Vietnam, neatly embedded in the mirror. The two large characters "统一" [Tǒngyī] ("Unification") were printed below the long map, and you pointed to the red line on the map that divided our motherland. Every time you picked up the mirror, you always looked at both the North and the South; that Vietnam, divided by the red line, caused your heart to ache. This was a gift from the Vietnamese Arts Troupe, given to you as a farewell souvenir; you loved Vietnam so much that you cherished the mirror day and night. I looked at the mirror, then at you, and a myriad of feelings surged within me. I held your hands tightly, and the train rumbled on, shaking the earth.

    统一的镜子——和一位中国女乘务员的会见
    越南　瞿辉瑾我认识你是在中越国际列车上在两个车厢之间，我们亲如一家骨肉，愉快融洽地交谈。列车在黑夜里飞驰，窗外的寒风呼啸，你投给我亲切的目光，眼睛凝视着南方。你递给我一面小镜子，脸上有些激动；一张越南地图，端正地镶在镜中。“统一”两个大字，印在长长的地图下边，你指着地图上的分裂我们祖国的红线。你每次拿起镜子，总要看一看南北两方；那被红线分割开的越南，使你的心感到痛苦。这是越南文工团的礼物，临别送你作纪念；你是这样热爱越南，日夜把镜子珍藏在身边。我看看镜子，又看看你，使我百感交集。我紧握着你的双手，列车隆隆飞奔，震撼着大地。
