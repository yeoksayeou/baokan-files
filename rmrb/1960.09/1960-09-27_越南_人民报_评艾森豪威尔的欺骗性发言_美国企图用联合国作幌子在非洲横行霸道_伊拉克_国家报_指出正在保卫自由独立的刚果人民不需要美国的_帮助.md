Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 24th - The Vietnamese "People's Daily" today published a commentary entitled "The Appearance of Peace, the Essence of Colonialism and Belligerence," stating that Eisenhower's speech at the UN on September 22nd can be taken as an example of the traditional, deceptive diplomatic tricks of imperialist countries. This diplomatic trick is to say that what one is doing is not what one is doing; and to insist that what one is not doing is what one is doing. Not only that, but American imperialism is also brazenly transferring the actions it is meddling in to other countries.

The commentary said that American imperialism is taking despicable actions in the Congo, using the flag of the United Nations to disguise itself. They support the Katanga puppet group in creating disturbances, plotting to split the Congo, and even overthrowing the Lumumba government, which defends the Congo's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and implements a policy of peace and international cooperation. This is precisely the fact, but Eisenhower glibly put forward a plan to not interfere in African countries and guarantee the security of these countries. He hypocritically called for the "protection" of new African countries, "accused" foreign interference in Africa, and lamented that people do not respect the prestige of the United Nations in the Congo. The essence of the U.S. action plan in Africa is nothing more than a conspiracy to use the United Nations as a guise to force countries that love freedom and justice to stand by and watch American imperialism run amok, undermining the sovereignty and independence of the Congo and African countries.

The commentary also said that American imperialism is pursuing new colonialism, attempting to replace British and French imperialism in Africa, and is strengthening its exploitation of Latin America under the guise of "aid." U.S. policies are all about casting a bait to catch a big fish, investing one to gain ten. The most dangerous point that underdeveloped countries and newly independent countries must be vigilant about is that accepting American "aid" inevitably means accepting political conditions, and sovereignty will inevitably be infringed upon. For six years, American imperialism has given the Ngo Dinh Diem group nearly two billion in "aid," but the economy of South Vietnam is still desolate and has become a colony of American imperialism. When Laos advocated implementing peaceful neutrality, the United States even threatened to stop "aid" to Laos. The United States has already stopped "aid" to Cuba, and Eisenhower's plan to "aid" Latin America is just bait to win over Latin American countries to oppose Cuba. This is the essence of American "aid." Therefore, if Eisenhower asks the United Nations to systematically "aid" African, South American, Asian, and Middle Eastern countries, this is just a conspiracy to deceive the people of all countries by dressing up American "aid" in the cloak of the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, September 25th - The Iraqi "National News" published an editorial today saying: Eisenhower's proposals on the issue of the African continent, especially the Congo issue, put forward at the United Nations General Assembly, expressed not only the position of the United States but also the position of all imperialists.

The newspaper pointed out that all the conspiracies that have been carried out in the Congo and are still being carried out there are carried out by imperialists with the support of the United Nations forces. All these conspiracies are carried out especially with the assistance of the United States. The newspaper emphasized that the Congolese people, who are defending their freedom and independence, do not need the "help" of Americans, what they need is to exclude Americans from any assistance they seek.

    越南“人民报”评艾森豪威尔的欺骗性发言
　　美国企图用联合国作幌子在非洲横行霸道
    伊拉克“国家报”指出正在保卫自由独立的刚果人民不需要美国的“帮助”
    新华社河内24日电　越南“人民报”今天以“和平的外表，殖民主义和好战的实质”为题发表评论说，艾森豪威尔9月22日在联大的演说，可以作为帝国主义国家传统的、欺骗性的外交伎俩的一个范例。这种外交伎俩就是：把自己正在做的说成不是自己做的；而把自己不做的硬要说成是自己正在做的。不仅如此，美帝国主义还把它正在插手进行的行动明目张胆地转嫁给别的国家。
    评论说，美帝国主义正在刚果采取卑鄙的行动，用联合国的旗帜来伪装自己。它们支持加丹加傀儡集团进行捣乱，阴谋分裂刚果，甚至推翻保卫刚果的独立、主权和领土完整、实行和平和国际合作政策的卢蒙巴政府。事实正是这样，但艾森豪威尔却信口开河地提出了关于不插手非洲各国、保证这些国家安全的计划。他假仁假义地呼吁“保护”非洲新的国家，“控诉”外国插手非洲，并哀叫人家不尊重联合国在刚果的威信。美国在非洲的行动计划的实质，不过是阴谋以联合国做为幌子迫使爱好自由和公理的国家束手坐视美帝国主义横行霸道，破坏刚果和非洲各国的主权和独立。
    评论又说，美帝国主义正在推行新的殖民主义，企图在非洲取代英、法帝国主义，打着“援助”的招牌加强对拉丁美洲的剥削。美国的政策都是投饵钓大鱼、投一收十的政策。不发达的国家和新获得独立的国家必须警惕的最危险的一点是，接受了美国的“援助”，一定要接受政治条件，主权一定会被侵犯。六年来，美帝国主义给吴庭艳集团近二十亿的“援助”，但是越南南方的经济仍然肃条，而且已经变成美帝国主义的殖民地。当老挝主张实行和平中立的时候，美国竟恫吓要停止对老挝的“援助”。美国已经停止了对古巴的“援助”，而艾森豪威尔关于“援助”拉丁美洲的计划，只是用来拉拢拉丁美洲国家反对古巴的鱼饵。美国的“援助”实质就是这样。因此，如果艾森豪威尔要求联合国有计划地“援助”非洲、南美洲、亚洲和中东各国的话，这只不过是为美国“援助”披上联合国的外衣来欺骗各国人民的阴谋而已。
    新华社巴格达25日电　伊拉克“国家报”今天发表社论说：艾森豪威尔在联合国大会上提出的关于非洲大陆问题，特别是刚果问题的建议，不仅表达了美国的立场而且表达了所有帝国主义者的立场。
    这家报纸指出，曾经在刚果进行、现在还在那里进行的一切阴谋活动，都是帝国主义者在联合国部队支持之下搞的。这一切阴谋都特别是在美国协助之下进行的。这家报纸强调指出，正在保卫自己的自由和独立的刚果人民不需要美国人的“帮助”，他们需要的是在他们所争取的任何援助中把美国人排除在外。
