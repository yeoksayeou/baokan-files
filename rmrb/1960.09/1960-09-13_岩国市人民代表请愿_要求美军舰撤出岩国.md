Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 9th: According to today's "Akahata" report, fourteen representatives from mass organizations in Iwakuni City and Yamaguchi Prefecture, including Nakamura, chairman of the Iwakuni Area Trade Union Council, and Yamamoto, secretary-general of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, submitted a petition to the mayor of Iwakuni City on the 7th, demanding that he take measures to urge the immediate withdrawal of the U.S. Seventh Fleet flagship "St. Paul" from the port of Iwakuni.

    However, their request was unreasonably rejected by the mayor.

    Prior to this, approximately one hundred representatives from organizations such as the Yamaguchi Prefectural Conference for the Abolition of the "Security Treaty" and various regional joint struggle conferences demonstrated in front of the Yamaguchi Prefectural Government Building, strongly protesting the entry of U.S. warships into the port of Iwakuni.

    岩国市人民代表请愿
    要求美军舰撤出岩国
    据新华社9日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，岩国地区工会协议会会长中村和山口县禁止原子弹氢弹协议会事务局长山本等岩国市和山口县群众团体代表十四人，7日向岩国市市长提交请愿书，要求他采取措施促使美国第七舰队旗舰“圣保罗号”立即撤出岩国港口。
    但他们的要求遭到市长的无理拒绝。
    在这以前，山口县民废除“安全条约”会议和各地区共同斗争会议等组织的代表约一百人，曾经在山口县政府大厦门前示威，强烈抗议美国军舰开进岩国港口。
