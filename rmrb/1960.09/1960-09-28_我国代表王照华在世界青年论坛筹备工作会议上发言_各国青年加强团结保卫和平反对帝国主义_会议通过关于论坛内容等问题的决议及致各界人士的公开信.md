Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The preparatory working meeting for the World Youth Forum was held in Moscow from the 15th to the 17th of September. The Chinese youth delegation, invited by the Soviet Youth Organizations Committee to attend the meeting, returned to China on the 23rd.

　　Participating in this preparatory meeting of the World Youth Forum were 142 delegates from 60 countries, representing 100 youth, student, and other organizations. The meeting adopted resolutions on the forum's content, program, and procedural issues, a resolution on the conditions for participation in the forum, and an open letter to people from all walks of life worldwide.

　　The meeting decided that the World Youth Forum would be held in Moscow in July 1961. The theme is "Youth of the 20th Century and Their Problems." Under this theme, discussions will be held on youth mutual understanding and cooperation, youth opposition to colonialism and imperialism, the struggle for national independence and peace, youth and disarmament, youth and their rights and obligations in society, and youth and progress.

　　The meeting decided to establish an International Support Committee for the World Youth Forum, which will be responsible for consulting among the relevant organizations on issues related to the preparation of the forum. The meeting also decided to establish a council for the International Support Committee for the Forum and a permanent secretariat in Moscow. This body is entrusted, together with the Soviet Initiating Committee, to carry out the preparatory work for the forum.

　　The open letter to people from all walks of life around the world, adopted by the meeting, pointed out that "Youth resolutely strive for peace and oppose the policies of the imperialist bloc," and that "Youth can contribute to the solution of the problems facing the entire human society." "We sincerely hope that the World Youth Forum will be a new and important contribution of the younger generation to the people of all countries in their struggle for peace, national independence, freedom, democracy, and the resolution of all pressing problems of youth."

　　Wang Zhaohua, head of the Chinese youth delegation, made a speech at the meeting. His speech was warmly welcomed by the participants.

　　In his speech, Wang Zhaohua expressed active support for the forum, believing that it is entirely correct to make the major issues that contemporary youth around the world are most concerned about the theme of the forum. He pointed out: "We have always advocated broad unity among the youth of all countries in the world, and we greatly appreciate that the forum should be broad in scope. We believe that through this forum, youth from different countries, different nationalities, and different political beliefs will be broadly united, and make positive contributions under the common goal of defending world peace, opposing the imperialist conspiracy of aggressive war, and realizing their beautiful ideals."

　　After analyzing the current situation of the world progressive youth movement, Wang Zhaohua pointed out: "The struggles of the youth of all countries in the world have always been mutually encouraging and mutually supportive. Unity is strength, and struggle leads to victory. With unity and struggle, we can defeat the imperialists' policies of aggression and war, defend world peace, and realize the beautiful ideals of youth."

　　Wang Zhaohua also emphasized: "The continuous strengthening of unity and the continuous improvement of the awareness of the youth of all countries have made the enemies of peace even more panic-stricken. In order to save their doomed fate, they are trying every possible means to poison the youth of all countries. They are doing everything possible to lure youth away from politics and social struggles, and using yellow culture and a decadent lifestyle to corrupt youth. They use intimidation to try to make youth succumb to their atomic blackmail and dare not resist their aggression and enslavement. They are also doing their utmost to divide the friendship and unity between the youth of all countries in order to disperse the strength of the youth. We hope to widely exchange views at the forum on how to deal with the imperialist poisoning of youth."

　　Wang Zhaohua concluded: "Let us unite more closely through the activities of the forum and jointly struggle to defend world peace, oppose the threat of new war, stop acts of aggression, strive for and maintain national independence, oppose the imperialist policy of poisoning youth, and defend the rights of youth."

　　我国代表王照华在世界青年论坛筹备工作会议上发言
　　各国青年加强团结保卫和平反对帝国主义
　　会议通过关于论坛内容等问题的决议及致各界人士的公开信
    新华社26日讯　世界青年论坛筹备工作会议于15日至17日在莫斯科举行。应苏联青年组织委员会邀请出席会议的中国青年代表团，已于23日回国。
    参加这次世界青年论坛筹备会议的，有来自六十个国家，代表着一百个青年、学生和其他组织的一百四十二名代表。会议通过了关于论坛内容、节目和程序问题的决议，关于参加论坛条件的决议以及致世界各界人士的公开信。
    会议决定于1961年7月在莫斯科召开世界青年论坛。主题是“二十世纪的青年及其问题”。在此主题下将讨论青年相互了解和合作、青年反对殖民主义和帝国主义、争取民族独立的斗争和和平、青年和裁军、青年及其在社会上的权利和义务、青年和进步等问题。
    会议决定成立世界青年论坛国际支持委员会，它负责就筹备论坛的问题，在各有关组织之间进行磋商。会议还决定设立论坛国际支持委员会理事会和在莫斯科设立常设书记处，这一机构受托和苏联发起委员会一起进行论坛的筹备工作。
    会议通过的致世界各界人士公开信中指出：“青年坚决争取和平、反对帝国主义集团的政策”，“青年可以对整个人类社会所面临的问题的解决作出贡献”，“我们深切地希望世界青年论坛将是青年一代对各国人民争取和平、民族独立、自由、民主以及解决青年所有的切身问题作出新的和重要的贡献”。
    中国青年代表团团长王照华在会上作了发言。他的发言受到了与会者的热烈欢迎。
    王照华在发言中表示积极支持这次论坛活动，认为把当代世界青年最关心的重大问题，作为论坛的主题是完全正确的。他指出：“我们一向主张世界各国青年广泛团结，很赞成论坛应具有广泛性。我们相信通过这次论坛活动，将使不同国家、不同民族、不同政治信仰的青年，广泛团结起来，在为保卫世界和平、反对帝国主义侵略战争阴谋、实现美好理想的共同目标下作出积极的贡献。”
    王照华在分析了当前世界进步青年运动的形势后指出：“世界各国青年的斗争从来都是互相鼓舞互相支持的。团结就是力量，斗争就能胜利。有了团结和斗争，就能够挫败帝国主义者的侵略政策和战争政策，保卫住世界和平，实现青年的美好理想。”
    王照华还强调指出：“各国青年团结的不断加强和觉悟的不断提高，使和平的敌人更加惶恐不安，他们为了挽救行将复灭的命运，正想尽一切办法毒害各国青年。他们千方百计引诱青年脱离政治，脱离社会斗争，利用黄色文化和腐朽透顶的生活方式来腐蚀青年。他们用恐吓的办法企图使青年屈服于他们的原子讹诈，不敢反抗他们的侵略和奴役。他们还极力分裂各国青年之间的友谊和团结，以分散青年的力量。我们希望在论坛上就如何对付帝国主义毒害青年的问题广泛地交换意见。”
    王照华最后说：“让我们通过论坛的活动更紧密地团结起来，为保卫世界和平，反对新战争的威胁，制止侵略行为，争取和维护民族独立，反对帝国主义毒化青年的政策，保卫青年权利而共同奋斗。”
