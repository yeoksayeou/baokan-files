The Organization of American States (OAS) Foreign Ministers' Conference, planned and manipulated single-handedly by the United States and held from August 16th, concluded on August 29th. The entire process and outcome of this conference demonstrate the United States' determination to strengthen its control over Latin American countries and intensify its intervention in the Cuban revolution. The American ruling clique is using the so-called Organization of American States as an important tool in pursuing its policy of aggression against Latin American countries.

The United States, by coercing a majority, forced the OAS Foreign Ministers' Conference to adopt a so-called "Declaration of San José." This declaration claims to "strongly condemn the intervention of countries outside the continent in the affairs of American countries" and expresses "opposition to and rejection of" "any threat from any country outside the continent" accepted by "any American country"; at the same time, it groundlessly shouts about the so-called "attempts by the Soviet Union and China to undermine continental unity and endanger the peace and security of this hemisphere." This is not a new trick. The United States has always used the so-called "communist threat" as a pretext to carry out intervention and control over Latin American countries. The United States is now trying to stir up new anti-Soviet, anti-Chinese, and anti-communist hysteria, simply to cover up its unpopular policy of aggression and lay the groundwork for its interference in Cuba and other Latin American countries' internal affairs.

Washington's trick of crying "stop thief!" is extremely clumsy. The crimes of the United States in interfering in the affairs of Latin American countries and trampling on their sovereignty are too numerous to mention. Anyone with a clear mind can see where the threat to Latin American countries really comes from. Was it not the United States, but some "country outside the continent," that subverted the democratic government of Guatemala? Was it not the United States, but some "country outside the continent," that carried out hundreds of acts of intervention against the Cuban revolution? Was it not the United States, but some "country outside the continent," that wholeheartedly supported the dictatorial regimes of Trujillo and Somoza, who were rejected by their own people? Was it not the United States, but some "country outside the continent," that set up military bases all over Latin America and sent warships to swagger in the Caribbean Sea? As for the so-called Soviet and Chinese "attempts to undermine continental unity and endanger the peace and security of this hemisphere," that is even more absurd. The United States' cruel oppression and insatiable plunder of the people of Latin American countries has shown the increasingly awakened Latin American people that it is their most vicious enemy. What "unity" is there between U.S. imperialism and the peoples of Latin American countries? If there ever was so-called "unity," it was U.S. imperialism itself that destroyed it, because it was U.S. imperialism's acts of aggression that inspired the Latin American people to rise up against it. The Soviet Union and China have not sent a single soldier to Latin America, nor do they have any military bases there. There is simply no question of any harm to Latin America's peace and security. What U.S. imperialism deeply abhors is obviously the support of the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other countries for the national democratic revolutionary movements of the Latin American people. Indeed, the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, as well as peace-loving and justice-upholding people all over the world, deeply sympathize with and resolutely support the struggle of the Latin American people for national independence, especially the Cuban people's struggle to defend the revolution and oppose U.S. intervention. But what is wrong with that? If the American ruling clique were not an enemy of the Cuban revolution and an invader of the national independence of Latin American countries, why would they regard the support of the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other countries for the national democratic revolutionary movements of the Latin American people as a monstrous flood? This arrogant attitude of U.S. imperialism, in fact, only shows that it completely regards itself as the master of Latin America and treats Latin America as a forbidden area to be arbitrarily plundered.

This imperialist intention of the United States is also clearly exposed in other parts of the so-called "Declaration of San José." This declaration talks at length about the "principles" of the so-called "Pan-American system," declaring that "all member states of the Organization of American States" must "comply with" the "discipline of the Pan-American system" and "reaffirm their trust in the regional system and their reliance on the Organization of American States." Everyone knows that the so-called "Pan-American system" is another name for the United States' complete control over the entire American continent, the "discipline" of this system is the command of the United States, and the Organization of American States is the tool for the United States to exercise its imperialist functions. Recently, the American ruling clique has repeatedly promoted its "Monroe Doctrine." Eisenhower openly declared at a press conference a few days ago that he wanted to "expand" this infamous "doctrine." This means that the United States wants to reaffirm the principle that "America is for Americans" and intensify its use of the Organization of American States to strengthen its control over Latin American countries. In the United States' sinister plan, the first thing is to strangle the Cuban revolution. The "Declaration of San José" forcibly passed by the United States at the OAS Foreign Ministers' Conference mentions the principle of "non-intervention," "respect for human rights," and opposition to "any form of totalitarianism," etc., which is to prepare for further U.S. intervention in Cuba. Because the United States has always used slanderous remarks, such as accusing Cuba of "interfering" in the internal affairs of other countries and being a "dictatorial regime" that does not practice "representative democracy," as a pretext for its intervention in Cuba. This OAS Foreign Ministers' Conference also decided to establish a committee to help resolve "Cuban-American differences" and monitor "problems in the Caribbean region." It is very obvious that the United States intends to use this organization to implement plans for further intervention in the Cuban revolution.

The United States' single-minded desire to strengthen its control over Latin American countries naturally exposes the aggressive ambitions of U.S. imperialism, and also reflects the increasingly high revolutionary situation in Latin America. The Cuban people have achieved revolutionary victory and, without fear of U.S. intervention and threats, are firmly pushing the revolution forward, which has had an increasingly great impact among the peoples of Latin American countries. The increasingly awakened people of Latin American countries have seen that the path of the Cuban people is their own path, and the cause of the Cuban people is the cause of the Latin American people. A powerful movement to resolutely defend Cuba and oppose U.S. intervention has irresistibly unfolded throughout Latin America. For months, there has hardly been a day in Latin America without mass movements supporting the Cuban revolution and opposing U.S. intervention. "Cuba yes, Yankees no!" has become the most popular slogan among the Latin American people. It is precisely the unprecedentedly high tide of the Latin American people's national democratic revolutionary struggle that has given U.S. imperialism a big headache. The authorities in the United States do not hide their anxiety. They have openly stated that to curb the tide of national democratic revolution in Latin America, they must first extinguish the Cuban revolution; at the same time, they are worried that to strangle the Cuban revolution, they cannot but encounter the opposition of the entire Latin American people. Therefore, after all kinds of U.S. ruling group's means of intervening in Cuba have failed, they are eager to use the Organization of American States to carry out collective intervention in Cuba, and first of all, they want to isolate Cuba. However, the broad masses of the Latin American people have long seen through what the so-called Organization of American States is. Recently, the progressive public opinion in Latin American countries has exposed the U.S. conspiracy to use the Organization of American States to interfere in the Cuban revolution, and people from all countries have held demonstrations against the Organization of American States acting as a tool for U.S. intervention in Cuba. This strong will of the Latin American people cannot but put a certain pressure on this conference. Therefore, it was not easy for the United States to realize its conspiracy at the OAS Foreign Ministers' Conference. In the first phase of the conference, delegates from various countries violated the intentions of the United States, rejected the U.S. proposal to establish a "special committee" to "supervise" "free elections" in the Dominican Republic and send troops to the Dominican Republic, and failed to realize the United States' conspiracy to control the political situation in the Dominican Republic and suppress the national democratic struggle, and to use this as a precedent to launch armed intervention against Cuba. On the contrary, they adopted a resolution to impose diplomatic and economic sanctions on the dictatorial regime of the Dominican Republic. This was beyond the expectations of the American lords. Even in the second stage of the conference, many countries still expressed their unwillingness to follow the United States' position of interfering in Cuba. Only after the United States carried out various means of coercion and inducement did the conference pass the "Declaration of San José." Of course, such a resolution is completely contrary to the will of the people of Latin American countries and does not conform to the interests of all Latin American countries. The governments of the few Latin American countries that follow the United States will undoubtedly be strongly opposed by their own people, because they not only put themselves in the position of accomplices of the United States in interfering in Cuba, but also pose a serious threat to their own national independence and national interests. They will obviously not have a good result by doing so.

The United States has engaged in some conspiracies at the OAS Foreign Ministers' Conference, and the American ruling clique may regard the so-called "Declaration of San José" as a big stick that it can use to further interfere in the Cuban revolution. But in fact, the San José Conference has not changed the situation that is extremely unfavorable to the United States in the slightest. On the contrary, the ferocious face and aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism are more nakedly exposed to the Latin American people. The Cuban people's attitude towards defending the revolution is unwavering. Cuban Premier Castro has already announced; "With or without the Organization of American States, the (Cuban) revolution is a fact that cannot be erased from this continent." Cuban Foreign Minister Roa has stated that Cuba rejects the resolution of the Latin American Foreign Ministers' Conference. The Latin American people's attitude towards defending Cuba and opposing U.S. intervention is also unwavering. The extremely bad practices of U.S. imperialism at the OAS Foreign Ministers' Conference can only further arouse the indignation of the Latin American people and prompt them to carry out the struggle against U.S. imperialist policy of aggression more courageously. The United States originally wanted to isolate Cuba, but the result can only be that the United States is more isolated in Latin America.

    岂容美帝国主义横行霸道
    由美国一手策划和操纵、从8月16日开始举行的美洲国家组织外长会议，已在8月29日收场了。这次会议的全部过程和结果表明，美国决意要加强对拉丁美洲国家的控制和加紧干涉古巴的革命。而美国统治集团在推行它对拉丁美洲国家的侵略政策时，把所谓美洲国家组织作为一个重要工具。
    美国挟持多数，强使美洲国家外长会议通过了一项所谓“圣约瑟宣言”。这个宣言声称什么“着重谴责大陆以外国家对美洲国家事务的干涉”，并表示“反对和拒绝”“任何美洲国家接受任何大陆以外的威胁”；同时还无中生有地叫喊所谓苏联和中国“破坏大陆团结和危害本半球和平和安全的企图”。这并不是什么新鲜的玩艺儿。美国一向就是打着所谓“共产主义威胁”的幌子，来实行对拉丁美洲国家的干涉和控制的。美国现在企图煽起新的反苏、反华、反共歇斯底里，只不过是为了掩盖它的不得人心的侵略政策，并且为它干涉古巴以及其他拉丁美洲国家的内政埋下伏笔。
    华盛顿这种贼喊捉贼的手法，是十分拙劣的。美国干涉拉丁美洲国家事务、蹂躏拉丁美洲国家主权的罪恶，真是罄竹难书。任何一个头脑清醒的人都会看得清楚，对拉丁美洲国家的威胁，究竟来自何方。颠覆危地马拉民主政府的难道不是美国而是“大陆以外”的什么国家吗？对古巴革命进行了成百次干涉活动的难道不是美国而是“大陆以外”的什么国家吗？死心塌地扶持受本国人民唾弃的特鲁希略、索摩查之流的独裁政权的难道不是美国而是“大陆以外”的什么国家吗？在拉丁美洲各处遍设军事基地，派了军舰在加勒比海耀武扬威的难道不是美国而是“大陆以外”的什么国家吗？至于说到所谓苏联和中国“破坏大陆团结和危害本半球和平和安全”，那更是无稽之谈，美国对拉丁美洲国家的人民进行残酷的压迫和贪得无餍的掠夺，已经向日益觉醒的拉丁美洲人民表明自己是他们最凶恶的敌人，在美帝国主义和拉丁美洲各国人民之间，那里还有什么“团结”之可言？如果硬要说曾经有过所谓“团结”，那末破坏这种“团结”的不是别人，而是在拉丁美洲称王称霸的美帝国主义自己，因为正是美帝国主义的侵略行为激发拉丁美洲人民起来反对它的。苏联和中国在拉丁美洲并未派有一兵一卒，也无任何军事基地，根本谈不上什么对拉丁美洲和平和安全的危害。美帝国主义所深恶痛绝的显然是苏中等国人民对拉丁美洲人民民族民主革命运动的支持。不错，苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家的人民，以及全世界爱好和平和正义的人民，是深切同情和坚决支持拉丁美洲各国人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争，特别是支持古巴人民保卫革命和反对美国干涉的斗争。但这有什么不对呢？如果美国统治集团不是仇视古巴革命的敌人，不是拉丁美洲各国民族独立的侵犯者，为什么要把苏联、中国以及其他国家人民对拉丁美洲人民民族民主革命运动的支持，看同洪水猛兽呢？美帝国主义的这种狂妄的态度，事实上只表明了，它完全是以拉丁美洲的主人自居，而把拉丁美洲看作是由它任意宰割的禁脔。
    美国的这种帝国主义意图，在所谓“圣约瑟宣言”的其他部分中也清楚地暴露了出来。这个宣言大谈所谓“泛美体系”的“原则”，宣布“所有美洲国家组织的成员国都必须“遵守”“泛美体系的纪律”，“重申对区域体系的信任和对美洲国家组织的信赖”。谁都知道所谓“泛美体系”就是美国完全控制整个美洲大陆的别名，这个体系的“纪律”就是美国的号令，美洲国家组织就是美国行使它的帝国主义职权的工具。而最近以来，美国统治集团一再宣扬它的“门罗主义”，艾森豪威尔在前几天的一次记者招待会上公然宣称，要“扩大”这个臭名远扬的“主义”。这就是说，美国要重申“美洲是美国人的美洲”这一原则，而加紧利用美洲国家组织来加强对拉丁美洲各国的控制。在美国的罪恶计划中，首先就是扼杀古巴的革命。美国强使美洲国家外长会议通过的“圣约瑟宣言”中，提到什么“不干涉”原则、“尊重人权”、反对“任何形式极权主义”等等，就是为美国进一步对古巴进行干涉作准备。因为美国一直是以诬蔑古巴“干涉”他国内政、是不实行“代议制民主”的“独裁政权”一类谰言作为它干涉古巴的借口的。这次美洲国家外长会议还决定成立一个委员会帮助解决“古美分歧”和监督“加勒比海地区出现的问题”，很显然，美国是打算利用这个机构实行进一步干涉古巴革命的计划。
    美国一心要加强对拉丁美洲国家的控制，自然暴露了美帝国主义的侵略野心，同时也反映了拉丁美洲日益高涨的革命形势。古巴人民取得了革命胜利，并且毫不畏惧美国的干涉和威胁，坚定地把革命向前推进，在拉丁美洲各国人民中间产生了越来越大的影响。日益觉醒的拉丁美洲各国人民已看到古巴人民的道路就是他们自己的道路，古巴人民的事业就是拉丁美洲人民的事业。一个坚决保卫古巴、反对美国干涉的强大运动已在整个拉丁美洲势不可挡地展开了。几个月来，几乎没有一天在拉丁美洲没有支持古巴革命、反对美国干涉的群众运动。“要古巴，不要美国佬”已成为拉丁美洲人民最流行的一句口号。正是拉丁美洲人民空前高涨的民族民主革命斗争形势，使得美帝国主义大伤脑筋。美国的当权人物也不掩饰他们心中的焦灼，他们曾经公开表示，要遏止拉丁美洲民族民主革命浪潮，就首先得扑灭古巴的革命；而同时又担心要扼杀古巴的革命，却不能不遭到整个拉丁美洲人民的反对。因此美国统治集团在干涉古巴的各种手段都归于失败以后，就亟图利用美洲国家组织来对古巴进行集体干涉，而首先是想要孤立古巴。但是广大的拉丁美洲人民早已看穿了所谓美洲国家组织是个什么东西。最近拉丁美洲各国的进步舆论纷纷揭露美国利用美洲国家组织干涉古巴革命的阴谋，各国人民纷纷举行示威反对美洲国家组织充当美国干涉古巴的工具。拉丁美洲各国人民这种强烈的意志，不能不对这次会议发生一定的压力。因此，美国在美洲国家外长会议中实现它的阴谋，也并不是顺手称心的。在会议第一阶段，各国代表就违反了美国的意图，拒绝了美国提出成立一个“特别委员会”来“监督”多米尼加“自由选举”并派兵进驻多米尼加的建议，使美国控制多米尼加政局和镇压民族民主斗争、并借此制造先例来对古巴发动武装干涉的阴谋未能得逞，相反的却通过了对多米尼加独裁政权进行外交和经济制裁的决议。这是出乎美国老爷的意料之外的。就是在会议的第二阶段中，也仍然有不少国家表示不愿追随美国干涉古巴的立场。只是美国在进行各种各样威迫利诱的手段之后，才使得会议通过了那个“圣约瑟宣言”。当然，这样一个决议，是完全违背拉丁美洲各国人民的意志，也是不符合所有拉丁美洲国家的利益的。追随美国的少数拉丁美洲国家的政府，毫无疑问的必将遭到本国人民的强烈反对，因为它们不但使自己处于充当美国干涉古巴的帮凶的地位，而且也将给本国的民族独立和民族利益造成严重的威胁。它们这样做，显然是不会有好结果的。
    美国在美洲外长会议上是搞了一些阴谋，美国统治集团可能把所谓“圣约瑟宣言”看成是它可以进一步干涉古巴革命的一根大棒。但是事实上圣约瑟会议丝毫没有改变对美国极为不利的形势。相反的，是美帝国主义的凶恶面目和侵略本性更赤裸裸地暴露在拉丁美洲人民的面前。古巴人民保卫革命的态度是坚定不移的。古巴总理卡斯特罗早已宣布；“不管有没有美洲国家组织，（古巴）革命是不能从本大陆抹煞的事实”。古巴外长罗亚已经声明，古巴拒绝拉丁美洲国家外长会议的决议。拉丁美洲人民保卫古巴、反对美国干涉的态度也是坚定不移的。美帝国主义在美洲外长会议上极端恶劣的做法，只能更加激起拉丁美洲人民的愤慨，促使他们更勇猛地进行反对美帝国主义侵略政策的斗争。美国原想孤立古巴，但是结果只能是美国在拉丁美洲陷于更加孤立。
