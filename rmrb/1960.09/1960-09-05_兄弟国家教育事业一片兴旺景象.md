    Romania Attaches Importance to Developing Workers' Spare-Time Education
    Number of Students Enrolled Increases Significantly Compared to Last Year
    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest: In recent years, the Romanian education department has achieved great success in implementing universal education, improving the cultural level of the working people, and implementing the principle of combining education with production.
    In terms of universal education, Romania had more than 5,100 seven-year schools in the 1959-1960 school year, an increase of more than 690 compared to the 1955-1956 school year, and more than five times the number before liberation. The number of students in seven-year schools is now more than 620,000, an increase of 50% compared to the 1955-1956 school year. At the same time, Romania's four-year schools (primary schools) and eleven-year schools (middle schools) have also developed greatly.
    In order to improve the cultural and technical level of workers on the job, Romania has paid special attention to developing workers' spare-time education in recent years. The Romanian Council of Ministers made a resolution on improving night schools and correspondence schools in 1959 for this purpose. Currently, the number of students in secondary night schools and secondary correspondence schools has reached 93,000, 40,000 more than in the 1955-1956 school year; and the number of students in higher night schools and higher correspondence schools is 26,000, accounting for more than half of the total number of students in ordinary higher education institutions.
