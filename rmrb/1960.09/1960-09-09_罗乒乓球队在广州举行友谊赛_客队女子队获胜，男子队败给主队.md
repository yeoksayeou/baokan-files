Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th September: The Romanian men's and women's table tennis teams held friendly matches with the Guangdong First Table Tennis Team in Guangzhou on the evening of the 7th. As a result, the visiting women's team won the team competition with a score of three to two; the men's team lost to the home team with a score of two to five in the team competition. In the three hours and forty minutes of exciting matches, more than 6,000 spectators applauded enthusiastically for the outstanding performances of both sides from time to time.

　　In the women's team competition, the visiting team players demonstrated skillful techniques, with freedom in both attack and defense. On the home team, apart from Hu Keming, the women's singles champion of the first National Games, who won against European mixed doubles champion Alexandru and athlete Pitica with relatively close scores of two to zero respectively, Yang Qiaolai, a seventeen-year-old who won eighth place in the women's singles at the first National Games, was defeated by two female players from the visiting team with scores of zero to two respectively. Hu Keming and fifteen-year-old Liang Lizhen cooperated in doubles, but because their coordination was not ideal enough, they lost to the visiting team with a score of one to two.

　　The men's team competition was extremely fierce. After Cai Mingshu won against Retti with a score of two to zero in the first match, Popescu from the visiting team faced Rong Guotuan. This athlete, who visited Guangzhou four years ago, was very experienced and calm. He was able to suddenly counterattack from defensive chops. As a result, after losing the first game with a score of seventeen to twenty-one, he won two consecutive games with a score of twenty-one to seventeen, defeating Rong Guotuan with a score of two to one. Tan Zhuolin, a seventeen-year-old from the Guangdong First Team, performed excellently that day. When he faced European singles runner-up Negulescu, he played fiercely and aggressively, winning two consecutive games.

　　The Romanian men's and women's table tennis teams will also hold friendly matches with the Guangdong Second Table Tennis Team on the 8th.

    罗乒乓球队在广州举行友谊赛
    客队女子队获胜，男子队败给主队
    据新华社广州8日电　罗马尼亚男、女乒乓球队7日晚在广州与广东乒乓球一队举行友谊比赛。结果客队女子队以三比二获得了团体赛的胜利；男子队在团体赛中以二比五败给主队。在三个小时又四十分钟的精彩比赛中，六千多观众不时为双方的出色表演报以热烈的掌声。
    在女子团体赛中，客队选手表演了娴熟的技巧，攻守自如，主队除去年第一届全国运动会女子单打冠军胡克明以比较接近的比分分别以二比零赢了欧洲混合双打冠军亚历山德鲁和运动健将皮蒂卡外，曾在第一届全运会获女子单打第八名的十七岁的杨巧来分别以零比二被客队两员女将击败。胡克明和十五岁的梁丽珍合作，在双打中也因为配合得不够理想，以一比二负于客队。
    男子团体赛的战况是异常激烈的。第一场蔡明枢以二比零胜了雷蒂后，客队波佩斯库碰上了容国团。这位四年前访问过广州的运动健将，十分老练、沉着，他能在削球防守中突然反攻，结果在以十七比二十一先输一局的不利情况下，以二十一比十七的比数连赢两局，以二比一胜了容国团。广东一队十七岁的谭卓林这天表演出色，他和欧洲单打亚军内古莱斯库交锋时，打得又狠又猛，连下两局取胜。
    罗马尼亚男女乒乓球队8日还将同广东乒乓球二队举行友谊比赛。
