Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 21st: 125,000 Korean residents in Japan in seventy locations held mass rallies today, opposing the Japanese government's sabotage of negotiations for the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan and demanding an unconditional extension of the repatriation agreement.

More than 7,000 Korean residents in Tokyo who participated in the mass rally unanimously adopted a declaration, denouncing the Japanese government for undermining the repatriation work.

The declaration emphasized: "In view of the persecution of Korean residents in Japan by Japanese imperialism in modern history, we firmly believe that the Japanese government has the responsibility to charter ships to safely repatriate Korean residents to their homeland. However, far from doing so, the Japanese government is even bent on undermining the repatriation of Korean residents on ships provided by the Korean government. There is nothing more shameless than this."

The declaration stated that the Japanese government cannot use any pretext to evade its responsibility for ensuring the smooth repatriation of Korean residents in Japan, and nothing can stop the realization of the humanitarian demand for Korean residents to return to their homeland.

Speakers at the meeting included Communist Party representative Mitsuyoshi Matsumoto, Mrs. Anbe Kimiko, Deputy Director of the Japan-Korea Association, Yoshiro Hirano, Chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, and representatives of the Japanese Christians' Conference Against the Ratification of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." They all unanimously expressed their determination to work closely with Korean residents in Japan and strengthen the struggle for an unconditional extension of the repatriation agreement.

Mitsuyoshi Matsumoto and Yoshiro Hirano both emphasized that the struggle to repatriate Korean residents is not only a struggle to realize humanitarian principles, but also part of the struggle of the people of Asian countries against the conspiracy to form a new Northeast Asian military alliance.

The meeting elected approximately 180 representatives to visit the Prime Minister's Office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Health and Welfare, demanding that the Japanese government show sincerity in the Japan-North Korea negotiations on the extension of the repatriation agreement. The representatives also visited the headquarters of the Japanese Red Cross Society, demanding that the Japanese Red Cross Society adhere to the spirit of humanitarianism and not succumb to government political pressure. After the meeting, the participants held a demonstration march in the city.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 20th: Thirty-eight organizations from all walks of life in Japan jointly issued a statement today, condemning the Japanese government and the Japanese Red Cross Society for undermining the negotiations between the Japan and North Korean Red Cross delegations on extending the term of the repatriation agreement for Korean residents.

The statement pointed out that the Japanese Red Cross Society's proposal, which focuses on extending the agreement for only six months and accelerating the repatriation work, is an attempt to evade responsibility for undermining the repatriation work under the guise of "promotion."

　  要求日本政府无条件延长遣侨协定
　　十二万旅日朝侨分别集会示威
    日本三十八个团体谴责政府破坏日朝遣侨谈判
    据新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本七十个地方的十二万五千名旅日朝侨今天分别举行群众大会，反对日本政府破坏遣送旅日朝侨回国的谈判，要求无条件延长遣侨协定。
    东京的七千多名参加群众大会的朝侨一致通过宣言，痛斥日本政府破坏遣侨工作。
    宣言强调说：“鉴于在日本的现代史上，朝侨受到日本帝国主义的迫害，因此，我们坚决认为，日本政府有责任租用船只来安全地遣送朝侨回国。但是，日本政府远不是这样做，甚至一心想破坏朝侨搭乘朝鲜政府提供的船只回国。再没有比这更无耻的事了。”
    宣言说，日本政府不能假借任何借口来推卸保证顺利遣送旅日朝侨回国的责任，并且任何东西都不能阻挡实现朝侨回国的人道主义要求。
    在大会上讲话的有共产党代表松本三益、日朝协会副会长安部君子夫人、日本和平委员会理事长平野义太郎、日本基督教徒反对批准日美“安全条约”会议代表。他们都一致表示决心同旅日朝侨紧密合作，加强争取无条件延长遣侨协定的斗争。
    松本三益和平野义太郎一致强调指出，争取遣送朝侨回国的斗争不仅是争取实现人道主义原则的斗争，而且也是亚洲各国人民反对成立新的东北亚军事同盟阴谋的斗争的一部分。
    大会上推选了大约一百八十名代表去访问总理府、外务省、厚生省，要求日本政府在日朝双方关于延长遣侨协定的谈判中表示诚意。代表们还访问了日本红十字会总部，要求日本红十字会坚持人道主义精神，不要屈服于政府的政治压力。参加大会的人们会后在市内举行了示威游行。
    据新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本三十八个各界团体今天联合发表声明，谴责日本政府和日本红十字会破坏日朝红十字会代表团关于延长遣送朝侨协定期限的谈判。
    声明指出，以协定只能延长半年和加快遣送工作为要点的日本红十字会的建议，是假借“促进”名义企图回避承担破坏遣侨工作的责任。
