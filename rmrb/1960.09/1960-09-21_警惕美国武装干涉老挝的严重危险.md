    Be Vigilant Against the Grave Danger of U.S. Armed Intervention in Laos
    Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the Thai authorities brazenly shelled Vientiane on the morning of September 18, taking armed aggression against Laos. This act of aggression by Thailand has aroused great indignation from the Lao Royal Government and people. The Lao Royal Government has lodged a stern protest with the Thai authorities. The Chinese people express their deep sympathy and resolute support for the Lao people's just struggle against U.S. and Thai intervention, safeguarding national independence, and adhering to a policy of peace and neutrality.
    The Thai shelling of Vientiane is a serious signal, indicating that U.S. imperialism's arrogant interference in Laos' internal affairs is developing from indirect support for the Lao pro-American traitorous clique's nefarious activities to subvert the Lao Royal Government, to launching armed aggression against Laos. As everyone knows, since the coup in Laos on August 9, U.S. imperialism has been engaging in conspiracies to interfere in Laos' internal affairs and support the restoration of the Lao pro-American traitorous clique in various ways. The U.S. State Department openly announced that it does not recognize the legitimate Lao Royal Government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma. U.S. imperialism fully supports the so-called "Revolutionary Committee" established in Savannakhet, headed by the Lao pro-American traitors Nosavan and Boun Oum. The U.S. propaganda machine is vigorously encouraging the Nosavan group to "march on Vientiane." U.S. imperialism has further instigated the Thai ruling clique to carry out military provocations against the Lao government, openly colluding with and supporting the Nosavan group, sending a large number of officers and soldiers to join Nosavan's army, and helping Nosavan group's troops to advance towards Vientiane through Thailand. However, U.S. imperialism has clearly seen that the Lao pro-American traitorous clique's counterattack is difficult to succeed due to the resolute opposition of the Lao people. Therefore, U.S. imperialism, hiding behind the scenes, has to take action itself.
    Recently, Thai Foreign Minister Nai Thanat Khoman clamored that the situation in Laos "may escalate into an international event." Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat even threatened to demand that the United States "take action quickly." On September 15, the U.S. government announced that it would send more naval forces to operate in the South China Sea near the Indochina Peninsula. 1,100 U.S. Marines occupying Taiwan and some ships of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, led by an aircraft carrier, have sailed to the South China Sea "to prepare for combat at any time." Carson, commander of the U.S. naval forces in the Philippines, hysterically clamored that the U.S. Seventh Fleet is "fully prepared to take action" and boasted that the U.S. aircraft carrier in the South China Sea "can attack any location in the region." The above situation clearly exposes the U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to escalate international tensions and provoke a local war in Laos. This cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of the people of Indochina, the people of Southeast Asia, and all peace-loving people in the world.
    In order to cover up its crimes of plotting a war of aggression in the Indochina region, U.S. imperialism is launching a so-called "communist aggression" smear campaign. Just one day before Thailand shelled Vientiane, the Nosavan group, entrenched in Savannakhet, apparently under the instruction of U.S. imperialism, issued a so-called "appeal," wantonly spreading rumors that "Viet Minh troops...are advancing," and that "Chinese, Lao Viet, and Viet Minh mixed troops are preparing to act" on the Lao border, and so on. All these utterly fabricated and shameless slanders are merely to create excuses for the U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionaries to launch armed aggression against Laos. Everyone remembers that last year, in order to invade and interfere in Laos, U.S. imperialism also instigated the Lao pro-American traitorous group to make so-called "Viet Minh aggression" cries. But as a result, this shameless trick was completely exposed under the eyes of the people of the world. Even the United Nations "Investigative Sub-Committee" manipulated by U.S. imperialism had to admit that this cry of the Lao pro-American traitorous group was completely fabricated. Now, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are once again resorting to the long-bankrupt slander of "communist aggression." Needless to say, this is a futile effort. The U.S. State Department issued a sinister statement on the situation in Laos on September 10, threatening the Lao people, saying: "Any activities by any other foreign country or its agents to interfere directly or indirectly using the existing turmoil (in Laos) will make it (the United States) immediately consider this to be related to itself." Obviously, this statement by the U.S. State Department is a smokescreen for U.S. imperialism's activities to launch armed intervention in Laos. It is a despicable trick of a thief crying "stop thief!" Facts are the best testimony. Isn't it U.S. imperialism itself that is mobilizing its fleet in the South China Sea to threaten Laos with force? Isn't it the Thai reactionaries, the running dogs of U.S. imperialism, who have carried out armed provocations against Laos? The Lao people know very well that it is none other than U.S. imperialism that is carrying out direct or indirect interference in Laos.
    The U.S. interference and aggression against Laos is a continuation of its criminal policy of undermining the Geneva Accords, destroying Laos' peaceful and neutral status, controlling and enslaving Laos, and turning Laos into its military base. Originally, the Geneva Accords and the 1957 Vientiane Agreements had opened up good prospects for Laos' independence, national harmony, and path to peace and neutrality. It was only due to the interference and aggression of U.S. imperialism that the peace of Laos was undermined and the Lao civil war was provoked. The Lao people and patriotic soldiers, seeing that their motherland was being dragged onto a dangerous road by U.S. imperialism, could no longer tolerate it and were finally forced to rise up and overthrow the pro-American traitorous government. After the coup in Laos on August 9, the new Lao government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma announced that it would implement a genuine policy of peace and neutrality, respect the Geneva Accords, implement national harmony internally, and strengthen friendly relations with neighboring countries and all countries that are willing to establish good relations with Laos externally. This cannot but be another major defeat for U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war in Asia. However, U.S. imperialism will never be reconciled to failure. It will never tolerate the emergence of an independent, peaceful, and neutral Laos. That is why it is impatiently waving the big stick, blatantly interfering in Laos' internal affairs, and even resorting to blatant military threats and plotting local wars. U.S. imperialism has once again proven with its actions that it is the most ferocious enemy of the independence and freedom of the Asian people, and the most ferocious enemy of peace in Asia and the world.
    However, it must be pointed out that the increasingly arrogant interference and aggression of U.S. imperialism against Laos can only further arouse the awareness of the Lao people, make them unite more closely, and strengthen their just struggle to safeguard national independence and oppose U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. If U.S. imperialism dares to disregard the condemnation of the world and launches a new war of aggression in the Indochina region, undermining peace in the Far East, then it will inevitably suffer an even more shameful and disastrous defeat.

### 警惕美国武装干涉老挝的严重危险

    警惕美国武装干涉老挝的严重危险
    泰国当局在美帝国主义的指使下，竟然在9月18日清晨炮轰万象，对老挝采取了武装侵略行动。泰国的这一侵略行动，已经引起了老挝王国政府和人民的极大愤慨，老挝王国政府已向泰国当局提出了严正的抗议。对于老挝人民反对美国和泰国干涉、维护民族独立、坚持和平中立政策的正义斗争，中国人民表示深切的同情和坚决的支持。
    泰国炮击万象，这是一个严重的讯号，表明美帝国主义对老挝内政的狂妄干涉，正在从间接支持老挝的亲美卖国集团颠覆老挝王国政府的罪恶活动，进一步发展到对老挝发动武装侵略了。大家知道，自从8月9日老挝发生政变以来，美帝国主义一直在多方面地进行着干涉老挝内政和扶植老挝亲美卖国集团复辟的阴谋活动。美国国务院公开宣布不承认合法的以梭发那·富马亲王为首的老挝王国政府，美帝国主义全力支持在沙湾拿吉成立的以老挝亲美卖国分子诺萨万和文翁为首的所谓“革命委员会”，美国的宣传机器则竭力鼓动诺萨万集团向“万象进军”。美帝国主义更唆使泰国统治集团向老挝政府进行军事挑衅，公开勾结和支持诺萨万集团，派遣大批官兵参加诺萨万的军队，并且帮助诺萨万集团的军队借道泰国向万象推进。但是，美帝国主义显然已经看到，老挝亲美卖国集团的反扑，由于遭到老挝人民的坚决反对，而难于得逞，于是，躲在幕后的美帝国主义就不得不亲自动手了。
    最近，泰国外交部长乃他纳叫嚷老挝局势“可能扩大为国际事件”。泰国总理乃沙立还扬言要求美国“迅速采取行动”。9月15日美国政府宣布增派海军力量到印度支那半岛附近的南中国海活动。侵占台湾的一千一百名美国海军陆战队和美国第七舰队以一艘航空母舰为主的一些舰只，已开往南中国海“准备随时战斗”。美国驻菲律宾海军部队司令卡逊歇斯底里地叫嚣美国第七舰队“充分做好了采取行动的准备”，并且吹嘘南中国海上的美国航空母舰“能够攻击这个地区的任何地点”。上述情况清楚地暴露了美帝国主义为了加剧国际紧张局势，在老挝挑起局部战争的阴谋。这不能不引起印度支那各国人民、东南亚各国人民和全世界一切爱好和平人民的严重警惕。
    美帝国主义为了掩盖它在印度支那地区策动侵略战争的罪行，正在发动一个所谓“共产党侵略”的造谣诬蔑运动。就在泰国炮击万象的前一天，盘踞沙湾拿吉的诺萨万集团显然是在美帝国主义的授意下，发表了一个所谓“呼吁书”，大肆造谣说什么“越盟军队……正在前进”，什么在老挝边界“中共、寮越和越盟混合部队正在准备行动”等等。所有这些彻头彻尾捏造的无耻的谰言，都只不过是为了替美帝国主义和泰国反动派对老挝发动武装侵略制造借口而已。大家记得，去年美帝国主义为了侵略和干涉老挝，也曾唆使老挝亲美卖国集团发出过所谓“越盟侵略”的叫嚷，但结果，这种无耻的手法在全世界人民的众目睽睽之下完全被戳穿了，就连美帝国主义操纵下的联合国的“调查小组委员会”最后也不得不承认老挝亲美卖国集团的这种叫嚷完全是捏造出来的。现在，美帝国主义及其走狗们又重新乞灵于早就破产了的“共产党侵略”的谰言，用不着说，这是枉费心机的。美国国务院9月10日就老挝局势发表一项居心叵测的声明，向老挝人民恫吓说：“任何其他外国或其代理人利用（老挝）存在的骚乱情况直接或间接进行干涉的活动将使它（美国）立即认为这同自己有关”。很明显，美国国务院的这项声明，是在为美帝国主义对老挝发动武装干涉的活动施放烟幕弹，是一种贼喊捉贼的卑劣的伎俩。事实是最好的见证，不正是美帝国主义自己在南中国海调动舰队，对老挝进行武力威胁，不正是美帝国主义的走狗泰国反动派对老挝进行了武装挑衅吗？老挝人民心里最清楚，对老挝进行直接或间接干涉的，不是别人，正是美帝国主义。
    美国对老挝的干涉和侵略，是它破坏日内瓦协议、破坏老挝和平中立地位、控制和奴役老挝、把老挝变成它的军事基地的罪恶政策的继续。本来，日内瓦协议以及1957年万象协议已经为老挝的独立、民族和睦以及走上和平中立的道路，开辟了良好的前景，只是由于美帝国主义的干涉和侵略，才破坏了老挝的和平，挑起了老挝内战。老挝人民和爱国士兵眼看自己祖国日益被美帝国主义拖上危险的道路，忍无可忍，终于被迫起来推翻亲美卖国政府。8月9日老挝发生政变以后，以梭发那·富马亲王为首的老挝新政府，宣布了要实行真正的和平中立政策，尊重日内瓦协议，对内实行民族和睦，对外则加强同邻国以及愿意同老挝建立良好关系的所有国家的友好关系。这不能不是美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略政策和战争政策的又一次重大失败。但是，美帝国主义是决不甘心失败的，它绝不会容忍出现一个独立、和平、中立的老挝。这就是为什么它迫不及待地挥舞起大棒，露骨地干涉老挝内政，以至不惜进行明目张胆的军事威胁，策划局部战争。美帝国主义又一次用自己的行动证明了，它是亚洲人民独立和自由的最凶恶的敌人，是亚洲和世界和平的最凶恶的敌人。
    但是，必须指出，美帝国主义对老挝越来越狂妄的干涉和侵略，只能进一步激发老挝人民的觉悟，使他们更紧密地团结起来，加强维护民族独立和反对美帝国主义及其走狗的正义斗争。如果美帝国主义敢于冒天下之大不韪，竟在印度支那地区发动新的侵略战争，破坏远东和平，那末，它将不可避免地遭到更加可耻的惨败。
