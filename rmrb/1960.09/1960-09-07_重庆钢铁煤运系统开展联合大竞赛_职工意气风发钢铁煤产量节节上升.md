Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 6th. Workers in Chongqing's steel, iron, coal, and transportation systems are conducting a vigorous joint competition in the campaign to increase production and practice economy. The workers in all units are in high spirits and full of energy, rapidly pushing steel production to a new level; the production of raw materials and fuels such as pig iron and coal coke is also rising steadily. In August, the city's output of steel, pig iron, and raw coal all increased significantly compared with July.

Since the second half of July, workers on the Chongqing steel, iron, coal, and transportation front have actively responded to the call of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and launched a joint competition. After the campaign to increase production and practice economy, centered on grain and steel, was launched, workers throughout the city, from steel mills to coal mines, from blast furnaces to every train and truck, further discussed and analyzed the current production situation and favorable conditions in various departments, proposed new goals, and added new measures, setting off a vigorous labor competition. The workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, who first proposed the initiative to carry out competition in the same profession and cooperation competition, launched a "one-dragon" desulfurization competition targeting the key to production within their own factory. All plants in the company, from coking to ironmaking to steelmaking, set up checkpoints at every stage and defended at every point. All workshops in the steelmaking plants, from the front of the furnace to the back of the furnace to the pig iron furnace, carried out desulfurization rivalries and technical performance competitions. They made full use of various indigenous and foreign desulfurization technologies, insisted on desulfurization in every shift and in every package, so that the output and quality of steel continued to improve. The workers of the No. 2 Open Hearth Furnace Plant carried out a large-scale desulfurization competition by district and achieved excellent results with high output and high quality. They have recently been rated as the champion of the inter-factory competition in the city's open hearth furnace system. In order to ensure a substantial leap in steel production, all coal mines and iron plants in the city have also joined the joint competition to ensure the production of more and better pig iron and coal coke to supply the steel plants.

In addition to carrying out competitions in the same type of work, various units have also joined hands and carried out collaborative competitions. The transportation departments played the role of production links, taking the initiative to link up with coal mines, iron plants, steel plants, etc., to carry out the "five-fix" movement of fixing tasks, fixing areas, fixing tools, fixing labor, and fixing leadership. The various steel plants and raw material production units such as coal mines and limestone mines were designated to ensure that they were produced and transported immediately to meet the needs of steel production. The factories and mines also took the initiative to create conditions for the transportation departments. Some mines and factories took the initiative to build roads for the transportation departments and cared about the production and lives of the workers in the transportation departments. Therefore, many shipping and railway units have basically achieved "producing as much as they transport" and "transporting whatever is needed."

While carrying out collaborative competitions, various units have also taken specific measures such as vigorously promoting advanced experiences and continuing to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, according to their specific circumstances, to promote the development of the campaign to increase production and practice economy. The workers of the ironmaking system comprehensively summarized various effective advanced operating methods in implementing the smelting policy of "high blast, high temperature, and refined materials." Focusing on the current key production issues in various plants, they organized advanced experience promotion teams to go deep into various plants to promote more than 30 advanced experiences such as high-alkalinity self-fluxing sintered ore and hot blast stove "multi-mouth, low-position, segmented, upward, and co-current" combustion, which greatly increased the output and quality of pig iron.

    重庆钢铁煤运系统开展联合大竞赛
  　职工意气风发钢铁煤产量节节上升
    据新华社重庆6日电　重庆市钢、铁、煤、运系统职工，在增产节约运动中，开展了热火朝天的联合大竞赛。各单位职工意气风发、干劲冲天，把钢的生产迅速推向了一个新的水平；生铁、煤焦等原料燃料的生产也节节上升。8月份，全市钢、生铁、原煤产量，都比7月份有显著增长。
    重庆市钢、铁、煤、运战线职工从7月下半月以来，就积极响应中共四川省委号召，开展了联合大竞赛。以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动展开后，全市从钢厂到煤矿，从高炉到每一列火车、汽车的职工，又进一步讨论和分析了当前各部门生产形势和有利条件，提出了新的目标，增加了新的措施，掀起了轰轰烈烈的劳动竞赛。首先提出开展同业务竞赛和协作竞赛倡议的重庆钢铁公司职工，针对自己厂内生产关键开展了“一条龙”攻硫竞赛。全公司从炼焦、炼铁到炼钢各厂，都做到关关设卡，处处设防。各炼钢厂从炉前、炉后到化铁炉各工段，都开展了攻硫的对手赛、技术表演赛。他们充分运用了各种土法洋法的脱硫新技术，坚持班班脱硫、包包脱硫，使钢的产量质量不断提高。平炉二厂职工分区开展攻硫大竞赛，取得了高产优质的优异成绩，最近已被评为全市平炉系统厂际竞赛的冠军。为了确保钢产量的大幅度跃进，全市各煤矿、铁厂也都投入了联合竞赛，保证生产更多更好的生铁和煤焦供应炼钢厂。
    除了开展同工种的竞赛以外，各单位还纷纷联合挂钩，开展协作竞赛。交通运输部门发挥了生产纽带作用，主动与煤矿、铁厂、钢厂等挂钩，开展定任务、定地区、定工具、定劳力、定领导的五定运动，将各钢铁厂和煤矿、石灰石矿等原料生产单位定点对口，保证随产随运及时供应钢铁生产需要。各厂矿也主动为运输部门创造条件，有的矿、厂主动为运输部门修路，关心运输部门的生产和职工生活。因此，很多航运、铁路单位已经基本上做到了“产多少、运多少”、“要什么、运什么”。
      在开展协作竞赛的同时，各单位还根据具体情况，采取了大力推广先进经验，继续开展技术革新和技术革命等具体措施，促进增产节约运动的发展。炼铁系统职工全面总结了在贯彻“大风、高温、精料”冶炼方针中各种行之有效的先进操作方法，并针对目前各厂存在的生产关键，组织先进经验推广队，深入各厂推广了高碱度自熔性烧结矿、热风炉“多嘴、低位、分段、向上、顺流”燃烧等三十多项先进经验，使生铁产量、质量大大提高。
