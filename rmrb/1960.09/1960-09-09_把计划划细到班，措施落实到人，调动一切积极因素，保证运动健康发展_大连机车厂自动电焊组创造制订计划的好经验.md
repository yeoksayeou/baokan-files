Mobilize all positive factors, and ensure the healthy development of the movement
The automatic welding team of Dalian Locomotive Factory created good experiences in formulating plans
(Reported by this newspaper) According to news from Lüda Daily: Workers from the automatic welding team of the tank workshop in the metal structure workshop of Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, after serious discussions, formulated a plan and measures for increasing production and practicing economy for the last four and a half months of this year, determined to withdraw 44% of the workers to support fraternal teams, and complete this year's leap forward plan ahead of schedule. They did what they said. In the week since formulating the plan for increasing production and practicing economy, despite having already withdrawn fourteen workers, the average daily output increased by 85%, the labor hour quota was completed by 116.5%, the rework rate of electric welding decreased by 78.8%, and more than 750 yuan was saved in material and tool consumption costs.

Study documents, improve understanding; meticulously inspect and find problems
After receiving instructions to launch the movement to increase production and practice economy, the automatic welding team first earnestly studied the People's Daily editorial "Immediately launch a movement to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel." All the workers in the team, in conjunction with the actual situation of the team, conducted full discussions and comprehensively inspected the team's work in the first seven months. In particular, they conducted in-depth inspections and summaries of seven aspects: the experience of the production leap forward in the first seven months, the consolidation, development and improvement of technological revolution achievements, equipment capacity and labor organization, product quality, management work, savings, and waste. Through inspection, they found that although the monthly plan had been overfulfilled in the first seven months, there was still considerable potential in terms of labor, product quality, raw materials usage, and planning management. Therefore, they discussed solutions one by one in detail and formulated the targets and measures for increasing production and practicing economy for the last four and a half months of this year.

Weekly plans, subdivided to the team; overall team plans, implemented to each person
In order to ensure the realization of the plan for increasing production and practicing economy, they first, according to the methods discussed, comprehensively compiled the team's monthly, weekly, and daily production, technology, and cost plans based on the indicators issued by the workshop, and implemented them to processes and individuals, so that everyone knew the daily targets for increasing production and practicing economy that they should complete. For example, in the third week of August, the workshop issued a production target of forty tanks to the team. In order to ensure the realization of the workshop target and the team's target for increasing production and practicing economy, they determined that forty-five tanks should be completed in the third week of August, with a daily output of seven to eight tanks; of which the first shift of eight hours should complete four tanks, and the second shift of seven and a half hours should complete three and a half tanks. They also broke down various indicators such as quality, materials, man-hours, and tool costs into smaller parts according to the process, contracting them to each person. The plan for increasing production and practicing economy formulated in this way was advanced and feasible, had a mass base, everyone had clear goals, and everyone tried every means to ensure its realization. For example, according to the team's plan, the end plate welding process was to produce four units per shift, but on the first day of implementing the plan, one of the two workers in this process was absent due to illness, directly affecting the completion of the plan. The remaining worker, Li Zhongying, said: "The plan was made by ourselves, and we must complete it no matter how great the difficulties." Therefore, he exerted his soaring energy, worked hard and cleverly, adopted the method of making the most of time and using double-carriage cycle welding, and completed the task of two people by himself, reaching five units per shift. The next day, he again completed the task of two people by himself.

Improve the system, strengthen management; daily assessment, everyone is responsible
Comprehensive management, assessment every day, analysis every ten days, and summary at the end of the month are important measures taken by this team to ensure the realization of various indicators for increasing production and practicing economy. They established one account book (general ledger), two records (shift handover record, meeting record), three tickets (material requisition ticket, labor hour quota ticket, timekeeping ticket), four registers (tool consumption registration register, material accounting registration register, quality inspection registration register, technological innovation registration register), five tables (labor quota completion table, product progress table, attendance table, wage calculation table, index competition evaluation table), seven ten-day reports (output completion ten-day report, material usage ten-day report, man-hour quota completion ten-day report, quality inspection ten-day report, attendance ten-day report, tool cost ten-day report), and seven systems (tool issuance and management system, material issuance and management system, product quality responsibility system, attendance system, shift handover system, technical management equipment maintenance system, meeting system), and in accordance with the characteristics of the two-shift production, they took into account that everyone could participate in management, be conscientious and responsible, and also took care to give play to their respective production strengths, and both shifts established a complete set of team management mechanisms. These simple forms do not take up much of the workers' spare time, and each "member" can handle their own business in only about ten minutes each day. This team adopted a "multi-person, one-member system," so that all forty workers in the team had something to do and everything was taken care of, greatly giving play to the enthusiasm of each "member" and powerfully promoting the realization of the indicators for increasing production and practicing economy. For example, on the first day after the plan was formulated, quality inspector Shang Mingren found that although the overall rework of the team had dropped from five meters to two point two meters, it still had not reached the target, and immediately suggested that the team leader contract out each process to grasp quality, while he himself helped the workers with the highest rework rate to come up with ways to reduce the rework rate. As a result, the rework rate dropped to one and a half meters the next day, and then declined day by day, greatly exceeding the quota.

Competition, no concessions; complete the plan, support each other
After the plan was implemented, challenges and responses were launched between the shifts of each process. The content of the competition was several indicators for increasing production and practicing economy of the team, and the results of the competition were announced and evaluated every day. For example, Lin Rongfeng and Gao Guihua worked on the same process and launched a competition. On the first day, Lin Rongfeng completed four units in one shift, completing the target; Gao Guihua completed only three units in the second shift due to impatience and more than three meters of rework, failing to meet the planned target. Gao Guihua was not discouraged. The next day, with the help of others, she reduced the rework to 200 centimeters at once, and the output also completed the plan. The two people chased each other, and after a few days, Lin Rongfeng's output increased to five units, and Gao Guihua's output increased to three point eight units, both exceeding the target.

Core leadership, greatly strengthened; increasing production and practicing economy, greatly guaranteed
Every work of the automatic welding team is carried out under the organizational leadership of the Party group as the core. They convene Party group meetings to study every work before it is carried out or when problems occur during the work. For example, once all the team's indicators were completed very well, only the welding flux indicator was not met. The Party group held a meeting to study and put forward the requirement to the masses that "welding flux is as precious as gold and must be used sparingly." The requirements of the Party group immediately became the action of all the workers in the team. Lin Rongfeng and apprentices immediately established welding flux saving buckets for the shifts, and Jing Jinchen and Li Jichen successfully tried using welding slag instead of good welding flux, which greatly saved welding flux.

    把计划划细到班，措施落实到人，调动一切积极因素，保证运动健康发展
    大连机车厂自动电焊组创造制订计划的好经验
    本报讯　据旅大日报消息：大连机车车辆厂金构车间罐子工段自动电焊小组工人经过认真讨论，制订了今年后四个半月的增产节约计划和措施，决心在抽出44％的工人支援兄弟小组的情况下，提前全面完成今年的跃进计划。他们说干就干，制订增产节约计划后一个星期以来，在已经抽走十四名工人的情况下，平均日产量提高了85％，完成劳动工时定额116.5％，电焊返修率下降78.8％，节约材料、工具消耗费七百五十余元。
   学习文件，提高认识；细致检查，找出问题
    自动电焊小组在接到开展增产节约运动的指示后，首先认真地学习了人民日报《立即开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动》的社论。全组工人结合小组实际情况进行了充分讨论，全面地检查了前七个月的小组工作，特别对前七个月生产跃进的经验、技术革命成果的巩固发展与提高、设备能力与劳动组织、产品质量、管理工作、节约、浪费等七个方面的情况，进行了深入的检查与总结。通过检查，他们发现，头七个月虽然月月超额完成计划，但是，在劳动力、产品质量以及原料材料使用和计划管理等方面，仍有不少潜力，于是，他们就逐一地细致地讨论了解决办法，订出了今年后四个半月的增产节约指标与措施。
    一周计划，划细到班；全组计划，落实到人
    为了保证增产节约计划的实现，他们首先按照讨论出来的办法，根据车间下达的指标，全面编制了小组的月、周、日的生产、技术、成本计划，并将它落实到工序与个人，使人人都知道自己每天应该完成的增产节约指标。如8月第三周，车间下达小组的产量指标是罐子四十台，他们为保证车间指标及本组增产节约指标的实现，就确定8月第三周要完成罐子四十五台，日产七台到八台；其中一班八小时要完成四台，二班七小时半要完成三台半。其他像质量、材料、工时、工具费等各项指标，他们也都按工序化整为零，包干落实到每一个人。这样制订出来的增产节约计划，既先进可行，又有群众基础，人人奋斗目标明确，个个千方百计保证实现。如根据小组计划，焊端板工序一班班产四台，但是在执行计划的第一天，这个工序的两名工人中就有一人因病缺勤，直接影响着计划的完成。剩下的一名工人李忠英说：“计划是我们自己编的，遇到再大的困难也要完成它。”于是，他发挥了冲天干劲，苦干加巧干，采用见缝插针，双胎循环焊接的方法，一人完成了二人的任务，达到班产五台。第二天，他又一人完成了两个人的任务。
    健全制度，加强管理；天天考核，人人负责
    全面管理，一天一考核，十天一分析，月末一总结，是这个小组保证实现增产节约各项指标的重要措施。他们建立了一本账（总台账）、两个记录（交接班记录、会议记录）、三个票（领料票、劳动工时定额票、计时票）、四个簿  （工具消耗登记簿、材料核算登记簿、质量检查登记簿、技术革新登记簿）、五个表（劳动定额完成表、产品进度表、考勤表、工资计算表、指标竞赛评比表）、六个旬报（产量完成旬报、材料使用旬报、工时定额完成旬报、质量检查旬报、考勤旬报、工具费用旬报）、七个制度（工具收发管理制度、材料收发管理制度、产品质量责任制度、考勤制度、交接班制度、技术管理设备维护制度、碰头会议制度），并按照两班生产的特点，既考虑人人都能参加管理，尽职尽责，又照顾到发挥各自生产的特长，两个班都建立了一套完整的小组管理机构。这些简易的表格并不占用工人很长的业余时间，各“员”每天只用十分钟左右的时间就可处理完自己担负的业务。这个小组采用了“多人一员制”，使小组四十名工人，人人有事干，事事有人管，大大地发挥了各“员”的积极性，有力地推动了增产节约指标的实现。如在订出计划后的第一天，质量员尚明仁发现全组返修虽然由五米降至二点二米，但仍未达到指标，立即建议由小组长分工包干各个工序抓质量，他自己则帮助返修率最高的工人想出降低返修率的办法。结果，第二天返修率就降到一米五，以后逐日下降，大大超过了定额。
    擂台比武，各不相让；完成计划，互相支援
    在计划落实以后，每个工序的上下班之间都展开了挑战应战。竞赛的内容就是小组的几项增产节约指标，竞赛结果每天公布、评比。如林荣凤与高桂花同在一道工序上干活，就展开了对手赛。头一天，林荣凤干一班达到四台，完成了指标；高桂花干二班由于心急，返修三米多，只完成了三台，没有达到计划指标。高桂花没有灰心。第二天，她在别人的帮助下，使返修一下子降到二百厘米，产量也完成了计划。两个人你追我赶，几天以后，林荣凤的产量提高到五台，高桂花的产量提高到三点八台，都超过了指标。
    核心领导，大大加强；增产节约，大有保证
    自动电焊小组的每项工作都是在以党小组为核心的组织领导下进行的。他们在每项工作进行以前或在工作进行中发生了什么问题，都要召开党小组会议进行研究。例如有一次全组各项指标完成得都很出色，只有焊药指标没有达到。党小组就开会研究，向群众提出“焊药贵如金，必须节约使用”的要求。党小组的要求立即变成了全组工人的行动。林荣凤和徒工立即建立了上下班焊剂节约桶，景晋臣和李吉成试用焊渣代替好焊药成功，都大大节约了焊药。
