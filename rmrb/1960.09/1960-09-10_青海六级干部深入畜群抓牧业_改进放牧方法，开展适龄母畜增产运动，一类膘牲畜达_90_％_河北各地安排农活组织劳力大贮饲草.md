Qinghai's Sixth-Level Cadres Go Deep into Herds to Grasp Animal Husbandry
Improve Grazing Methods, Launch a Production Increase Campaign for Appropriate-Age Female Livestock, 90% of Livestock Reach First-Class Fatness
Hebei Arranges Farm Work, Organizes Labor to Store Forage Grass on a Large Scale

(Our newspaper, Xining, 9th) The broad masses of Party and government leading cadres at all levels in the pastoral areas of Qinghai Province are taking advantage of the current golden season of abundant pasture to go deep into yurts and herds, deep into the front line of animal husbandry production, to lead people of all ethnic groups to firmly grasp animal fatness, resulting in an extremely good situation in animal husbandry production. At present, the first-class fatness of all kinds of livestock has reached more than 90%. "Fatten up with meat in summer, fatten up with fat in autumn; with meat and fat, there's no worry in winter and spring." Sheep, horse, and cattle herds are scattered across the grasslands, and people of all ethnic groups are carefully grazing to increase the autumn fatness of livestock.

This year, Party committees at all levels in the pastoral areas of Qinghai Province have grasped agriculture with one hand and animal husbandry with the other. While vigorously engaging in grain production, they have more extensively and deeply launched the animal husbandry production increase campaign of "10,000 sheep, 10,000 lambs; 10,000 horses, 10,000 foals; 10,000 cattle, 10,000 calves" for appropriate-age female livestock, rationally arranged forces, and conscientiously and practically strengthened the leadership of animal husbandry production. From the province to the commune production team, sixth-level Party and government leading cadres went deep into the front line of production, serving as deputy positions in production teams, dividing areas and contracting tasks. Based on the characteristics of animal husbandry production, such as the dispersal of herds, high mobility, and difficulty in grasping the situation, many cadres also went deep into the herds, grazing with them, eating, living, working, and discussing matters with the herders, learning and summarizing grazing and work experience, and using points to lead the whole area. The Party Committee of Heri Commune in Zeku County, Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, went deep into the production team to work, mobilized the masses to improve grazing methods, and formed nine types of herds according to the characteristics of various livestock, namely: high-yield herds, large-area high-yield herds, general herds, breeding herds, selection herds, improvement herds, dairy cow herds, young animal herds, and fattening herds. This is conducive to herders improving their grazing skills, strengthening feeding and grazing management, and grasping animal fatness; it can also strengthen leadership, implement contracted work and production, and benefit breed improvement. Cadres going deep into the herds and strengthening leadership has also promoted the development of the "learn, compare, catch up, help" competition movement. The high-yield herds of each commune drove the large-area high-yield herds, and the large-area high-yield herds drove the general herds, forming a situation of mutual pursuit. Quanj Commune in Gangcha County, a red banner unit in animal husbandry production in the province, achieved a first-class fatness of over 98% for all types of livestock in the entire commune through the competition movement. In the county's campaign to "learn from Quanj, catch up with Quanj, and surpass Quanj," the first-class fatness of all types of livestock rose to over 95%.

Cadres and people of all ethnic groups are working together on the front line of production, giving greater play to the superiority of the people's commune. Due to the rational division of herds and pastures, and the implementation of rotational grazing by season and area, it has been ensured that every herd has a pasture and every pasture is fully utilized. According to the species, sex, age, and color of the livestock, they are divided into groups for grazing, which is not only conducive to the livestock's fattening and mating, but also to the adoption of different feeding methods for different types of livestock. In order to grasp the summer and autumn fatness, the communes in the pastoral areas all entered the summer pastures 20 to 50 days in advance this year. Due to the continuous socialist education conducted by Party organizations at all levels for the commune members of all ethnic groups, the herders are full of energy, extending the grazing time for sheep and cattle herds to 12 or 16 hours, and implementing round-the-clock grazing for horses. Based on the principle of rationally utilizing grasslands and increasing the carrying capacity per unit area, each contracted production unit has implemented mixed grazing methods for sheep, horses, and cattle, that is, sheep graze the tips of the grass in front, and horses and cattle graze the stems in the middle. All localities have also tried every means to supplement the feeding of weak livestock.

While grasping summer and autumn fatness, the prefectures and counties in the pastoral areas are also vigorously engaging in livestock breeding in the spirit of full mating and pregnancy. At present, more than 90% of the appropriate-age ewes have been mated and conceived, and more than 80% of large livestock such as mares have been mated, and cattle are in the peak period of mating.

(Xinhua News Agency) Hebei Province Party committees at all levels are taking advantage of the current favorable season for grass cutting, arranging agricultural work according to local conditions, and organizing labor to cut and store forage grass. At present, in addition to the current feed for livestock and pigs, a large amount of forage grass and feed has been stored.

All localities have made specific arrangements for grass-cutting labor according to the current busy farming situation. Shijiazhuang city organized commune members to collect forage grass in conjunction with the late-stage management of field crops. In addition to mobilizing the plains area to collect forage grass and feed in conjunction with weeding and eliminating wasteland, Xushui County also organized two professional grass-cutting teams to go up the mountains and down the waters to cut grass and salvage aquatic plants. In 20 days, the county has stored more than 40 million jin of grass. Based on the characteristics of many grassland beaches in the county, Baxian County organized more than 3,000 laborers to eat and live on the grassland beach, harvesting, drying, and storing on the spot. Under the premise of ensuring the labor required for eliminating wasteland and planting vegetables, Handan City, in addition to organizing a professional grass-cutting team of 40,000 people, also promoted the method of four combinations (combination of professional team and part-time work, combination of collective grass cutting and individual grass cutting, combination of large-scale blitz and sporadic grass cutting, combination of weeding and grass cutting), and mobilized all feeders, inseminators, epidemic prevention personnel, and all auxiliary labor to cut and store forage.

While collecting forage, all localities are also vigorously engaging in the production of Chlorella. According to incomplete statistics, more than 37,000 Chlorella culture ponds have been built in the province, and more than 4 million basins and pots have been used. In addition to producing and feeding, all localities also pay attention to storing dry powder, and Shijiazhuang city alone has stored more than 50,000 jin of dry powder. (Attached pictures)

    青海六级干部深入畜群抓牧业
    改进放牧方法，开展适龄母畜增产运动，一类膘牲畜达90％
    河北各地安排农活组织劳力大贮饲草
    本报西宁9日电　青海省广大牧区各级党政领导干部，趁当前牧草丰盛的黄金季节，深入帐房、畜群，深入畜牧业生产的第一线，领导各族牧民狠抓畜膘，使畜牧业生产出现了极为良好的形势。目前，各类牲畜一类膘达到了90％以上。“夏膘抓肉，秋膘抓油，有肉有油，冬春不愁。”草原上羊、马、牛群星罗棋布，各族牧民为牲畜增加秋膘精心放牧。
    今年，青海省牧区各级党委，一手抓农业，一手抓牧业，在大搞粮食生产的同时，更加广泛深入地开展了适龄母畜“万羊万羔、万马万驹、万牛万犊”的畜牧业增产运动，合理安排力量，认真切实地加强畜牧业生产领导。从省到公社生产队，六级党政领导干部深入生产第一线，到生产队担任副职，分片包干。根据牧业生产畜群分散、流动性大、不易掌握情况等特点，许多干部并深入畜群，跟群放牧，和放牧员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，学习和总结放牧、工作经验，以点带面。黄南藏族自治州泽库县和日公社党委深入生产队办公，发动群众改进放牧方法，根据各类牲畜的特点，组成了九类畜群，即：高额丰产群、大面积丰产群、一般群、种畜群、选育群、改良群、奶牛群、幼畜群、育肥群。这样作既有利于放牧员提高放牧技术、加强饲放管理，抓好畜膘；又能加强领导、实行包工包产，对品种改良也有好处。干部深入畜群、加强领导，还促进了“学、比、赶、帮”竞赛运动的开展。各公社的高额丰产群带动了大面积丰产群，大面积丰产群又带动了一般群，形成了你追我赶的局面。全省畜牧业生产红旗单位——刚察县泉吉公社通过竞赛运动，全社各类牲畜一类膘达到了98％以上，全县在开展“学泉吉、赶泉吉、超泉吉”的运动中，各类牲畜一类膘上升到95％以上。
    干部在生产第一线上跟各族牧民拧成一股绳，使人民公社的优越性得到更大的发挥。由于合理划分了畜群和草场，实行了分季划片轮牧，作到了群群有牧场，场场得到充分利用。各地根据牲畜的种类、性别、口齿、毛色分群放牧，既有利牲畜的抓膘、配种，又有利于各类不同牲畜采取不同的饲养方法。为了抓好夏、秋膘，今年牧区各公社都提前二十天至五十天进入夏季牧场。由于各级党组织对各族社员不断进行了社会主义教育，放牧员干劲充沛，对羊、牛群延长放牧时间至十二小时或十六小时，对马则实行昼夜放牧。根据合理利用草原、提高单位面积载畜量的原则，各包产单位都实行了羊、马、牛混群的放牧方法，即羊在前边吃草尖，马牛在中间吃草茎；对瘦弱牲畜各地也千方百计地进行了补饲。
    在抓好夏秋膘的同时，牧区各州、县还本着全配满怀的精神，大搞牲畜配种。目前适龄母羊配种受孕的已达90％以上，母马等大家畜已达80％以上，牛正处在配种盛期。
    据新华社讯　河北省各级党委趁当前打草有利季节，因地制宜安排农活，组织劳力打草贮饲。目前，除牲口猪只现吃以外，已贮存了大量饲草饲料。
    各地根据当前农活繁忙的情况，因地制宜地对打草劳力作了具体安排。石家庄全市组织社员结合大田作物后期管理采集饲草。徐水县除发动平原地区结合除草灭荒采集饲草饲料外，还组织了上山和下水的两支打草专业队，分别上山割草和打捞水草，二十天时间，全县已贮草四千多万斤。霸县根据本县草滩多的特点，组织三千多名劳力吃住在草滩，就地采割，就地晾晒，就地贮存。邯郸市在保证消除草荒和种菜所需劳力的前提下，除组织四万名的打草专业队以外，还推广了四结合（专业队与兼业结合，集体打草与个人打草结合，大片突击和零星打草结合，除草与打草结合）的办法，发动所有饲养员、配种员、防疫员和所有辅助劳力打草贮饲。
    各地在采集饲草的同时，还大搞小球藻生产。据不完全统计，全省已建好小球藻培养池三万七千多个，利用盆罐等四百多万个，各地除随生产，随喂养以外，还注意贮存干粉，仅石家庄市即贮存了干粉五万多斤。（附图片）
