Changing the Poor and Backward Face of Mountainous Areas
Wangmo Becomes a Red Flag County in the Qiannan Autonomous Prefecture

    This newspaper reports that the people of all ethnic groups in Wangmo County, under the leadership of cadres at all levels, have worked diligently to change the poor and backward face of the mountainous area in just over two years, becoming a red flag county in the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture.

    Wangmo County is located on the southern border of the Guizhou Plateau and is a mountainous area where the Buyi people live in concentrated communities. Before liberation, most agricultural production areas used wooden plows and harrows, and some still practiced slash-and-burn cultivation, unable to produce enough grain for self-sufficiency. Industry was also very backward. After liberation, although there was great development in all aspects, due to the poor foundation in the past, the backward situation had not changed by 1957.

    In early 1958, under the shining light of the Party's general line for building socialism, the people of all ethnic groups in Wangmo County worked hard and were determined to catch up with the advanced and strive for the upper reaches. Cadres at all levels went to the mountains and the countryside, and together with the people of all ethnic groups, shared weal and woe. Seventy percent of the cadres went to the production teams with tools such as hoes and sickles to settle down. In that year, in more than 400 production teams in the county, each team had a cadre who participated in production and led production for a long time.

    After the cadres went deep into the grassroots, they, together with the commune members, formulated long-term plans for transforming the mountainous areas and developing production according to local conditions. They also planned to build water conservancy projects to irrigate 50,000 mu of farmland before the spring plowing of 1958. The people of all ethnic groups quickly threw themselves into the water conservancy construction movement, setting off an unprecedented high tide of water conservancy construction. By early May, the county had completed small-scale water conservancy projects capable of irrigating 100,000 mu of farmland, exceeding the original plan by a factor of two. When rice transplanting began, some commune members were not accustomed to it and were unwilling to promote the experience of rational close planting. The cadres took the lead in planting rationally and densely, and taught the techniques to the commune members one by one. The commune members said, "The cadres are so concerned about production, how can we lag behind?" As a result, the experience of rational close planting was quickly promoted throughout the county.

    While developing grain production, the people's communes made full use of the favorable conditions in the mountainous areas to engage in diversified operations. Wangmo is located in the subtropical zone and is suitable for growing economic crops such as sugarcane and coffee. They introduced improved varieties of sugarcane from other places and expanded the planting area by one and a half times. As a result of vigorously developing grain production and diversified operations, the income of the people of all ethnic groups has increased year by year. In 1957, the average income per household in the county was 298 yuan. In 1958, it rose to more than 340 yuan, and in 1959, it increased to about 500 yuan.

    Thanks to the long-term hard work of cadres at all levels together with the people of all ethnic groups, the face of Wangmo County has been completely renewed. The county's grain production has increased year after year, achieving self-sufficiency with a surplus. In terms of industrial production, more than 170 factories producing farm tools, machinery, and fertilizers have been established, with an annual output value of more than 11 million yuan. Cultural, educational, health, and other undertakings have also been unprecedentedly developed. Since 1958, it has won the red flag in agriculture, industry, trade, and health in the autonomous prefecture for consecutive years. (He Yongfeng)

    改变穷困落后的山区面貌
    望谟成为黔南自治州的红旗县
    本报讯　望谟县各族人民，在各级干部的带领下，埋头苦干，经过两年多的时间，就改变了穷困落后的山区面貌，成为黔南布依族苗族自治州的红旗县。
    望谟县位于贵州高原南部边境，是一个布依族人民聚居的山区。解放前，大部分农业生产地区使用木犁木耙，有的还是刀耕火种，粮食不能自给；工业也很落后；解放后，这里各个方面虽然都有很大发展，但由于过去基础太差，到1957年止，仍未改变落后面貌。
    1958年初，望谟县的各族人民，在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，发奋苦干，决心赶先进，争上游。各级干部上山下乡，和各族人民一道，同甘共苦，70％的干部带着锄头、镰刀等工具，下到生产队安家落户。这一年，全县四百多个生产队中，每个队都有一个干部长期参加生产，领导生产。
    干部们深入到基层后，和社员们一起，因地制宜地制订了改造山区发展生产的长远规划，并计划在1958年春耕前，兴修灌溉五万亩农田的水利工程。各族人民迅速投入兴修水利运动，掀起了一个从未有过的兴修水利高潮。到5月初，全县就完成了能灌溉十万亩农田的小型水利工程，比原计划超出一倍。插秧开始，一部分社员不习惯，不愿意推行合理密植的经验。干部就带头栽合理密植秧，并把技术一一教给社员。社员们说：“干部这样关心生产，我们还能落后吗？”于是，合理密植经验很快就在全县推广起来。
    在发展粮食生产的同时，各人民公社利用山区有利条件，大搞多种经营。望谟地处亚热带，适合种植甘蔗、咖啡等经济作物。他们就从外地引进甘蔗良种，把种植面积扩大了一倍半。大搞粮食生产和多种经营的结果，各族人民的收入年年上升。1957年，全县每户平均收入为二百九十八元，1958年便上升到三百四十多元，到1959年时又增加到五百元左右。
    由于各级干部长期和各族人民一起埋头苦干，望谟县的面貌已焕然一新。全县粮食年年增产，做到自给有余。在工业生产方面，现已办起农具、机械、化肥等工厂一百七十多个，年产值已达到一千一百万元以上。文教卫生等工作，也得到空前发展。从1958年以来，连年荣获自治州农业、工业、财贸和卫生等方面的红旗。　　（贺永丰）
