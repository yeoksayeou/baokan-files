Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 1st. After concentrating labor to strengthen the agricultural production frontline, the Wan'an Commune in Santai County, Sichuan, has been vigorously grasping logistical work, using improved logistical support to strengthen and consolidate the frontline, ensuring that more than 80% of the labor force remains focused on production at the frontline.

In order to seize the opportunity to do a good job in autumn planting and autumn field management, and strive for more autumn grain harvests, the Wan'an Commune, starting in July, transferred more than 1,000 laborers from commune-run industries and logistical departments such as canteens and vegetable gardens to strengthen the agricultural frontline, bringing the labor force engaged in field work to 82.9% of the total labor force. With the strengthening of the frontline, logistical departments, with fewer personnel, faced increased work tasks and higher demands than before. Therefore, how to improve the work efficiency of logistical departments to meet the needs of the new situation became one of the important issues to ensure frontline production. The Commune Party Committee promptly paid attention to this issue and immediately instructed commune and team cadres to go deep into the canteens and breeding farms, personally participate in cooking, feeding cattle, and feeding pigs, understand the situation, discover problems, and explore experiences, in order to do a good job in logistics and consolidate the frontline labor force.

After a period of exploration, the cadres found that the labor force remaining in the logistical departments was originally sufficient, but due to excessively detailed division of labor and uneven workload, some departments appeared to be short of manpower. Based on this situation, the Commune Party Committee, on the basis of strengthening ideological education for all logistical personnel, and universally promoted the methods of "linking, managing, leading, reforming, and concentrating" in logistical work.

"Linking" means further unifying the various departments of the logistical front, combining them into a whole, led by the secretary of the Party organization in charge of life at all levels, unifying the use of labor, and mutual assistance during busy and idle times. For example, cattle breeders also manage grinding, vegetable growers also help the canteen pick vegetables, and grain keepers also carry water for the canteen, which is equivalent to adding one or two cooks to the canteen.

"Managing" means strengthening the labor management of logistical personnel, formulating new labor quotas in a timely manner according to the new situation, and implementing bonuses for exceeding quotas.

"Leading" means organizing commune members on the frontline to bring firewood, pig grass, and vegetables from the fields for the rear when they finish work. In the past, the Fifth Team of the Third Brigade had three dedicated people picking firewood every day. After implementing firewood delivery, it not only met the canteen's daily firewood needs, but also accumulated more than 2,000 kilograms in half a month.

"Reforming" means reforming tools, improving technology, and increasing work efficiency. The entire commune, with the reform of canteen tools as the center, vigorously promoted locally made running water, vegetable cutters, slicers, animal-powered mills, etc. Currently, more than 20 canteens have realized self-flowing water, eliminating the phenomenon of people carrying water, which not only does not occupy the main labor force, but also increases work efficiency more than tenfold.

"Concentrating" means appropriately concentrating some excessively dispersed pig pens, etc. This not only reduces personnel but also improves the quality of work. In the past, the Fifth Team of the Sixth Management Area of this commune raised pigs in a dispersed manner, with five breeders raising 37 pigs. Now it has been changed to joint pen breeding, managed by two breeders, and the management is more refined than before. In just 20 days, seven third-class pigs were fed into first-class pigs.

Now, all production teams in Wan'an Commune have promoted the above-mentioned methods in accordance with local conditions, making the logistical work take on a new look. Everything is arranged, and the quality of work has also been improved, prompting the labor force concentrated on the frontline of production to generally improve their enthusiasm for production.

### 统一组织调剂忙闲  改革工具提高工效  万安公社做好后勤工作增强前方力量

    统一组织调剂忙闲  改革工具提高工效
    万安公社做好后勤工作增强前方力量
    新华社成都1日电　四川三台县万安公社在集中劳力加强农业生产第一线以后，大抓后勤工作，用搞好后勤工作，来加强和巩固第一线，保证了80％以上的劳动力，坚持在第一线安心生产。
    万安公社为了抓紧时机，搞好秋种和秋田管理等工作，力争多收秋粮，从7月开始，在社办工业和食堂、菜园等后勤部门中抽出一千多劳力，加强了农业第一线，使参加田间劳动的劳力达到劳力总数的82.9％。第一线的力量增强后，后勤部门在人员减少的情况下，工作任务比以前增加，要求也比以前高。因此如何提高后勤部门的工作效率以适应新形势的需要，就成为保证第一线生产的重要问题之一。公社党委及时注意了这一问题，立即指示社、队干部深入食堂和饲养场，亲自参加煮饭、喂牛、喂猪，了解情况，发现问题，摸索经验，以便办好后勤工作，巩固第一线的劳力。
    经过一段摸索，干部们发现，留在后勤部门的劳力，本来是够用的，但因分工过细，忙闲不等，有的部门便显得人力不足。根据这个情况，公社党委在对全体后勤人员加强思想教育的基础上，并在后勤工作中普遍推广了“结、管、带、改、集”等办法。
    结就是把后勤战线各部门进一步统一起来，结合成为一个整体，由各级党组织管生活的书记挂帅，统一使用劳力，闲忙互济。如耕牛饲养员兼管磨，种菜的兼管给食堂摘菜，粮食保管员兼给食堂担水，这样作相当于给食堂增加了一到二个炊事员。
    管是加强后勤人员的劳动管理，及时按照新的情况制定新的劳动定额，实行超额奖励。
    带是组织第一线的社员收工时从田间为后方带柴、带猪草、带菜。三大队五小队过去每天都有三个专人拣柴，实行带柴后，不仅满足了食堂每天烧柴的需要，半个月中还积存了两千多斤。
    改是改革工具，改进技术，提高工效。全社以食堂工具改革为中心，大力推广了土自来水和切菜机、切片机、畜力磨等。目前有二十多个食堂实现了用水自流化，消灭了人挑水的现象，既不占用主要劳力，又提高工效十倍以上。
    集就是把有些过于分散的猪圈等适当集中。这样作不但可以减少人员，还能提高工作质量。这个社的第六管理区五小队过去养猪分散，五个饲养员养三十七头猪，现在改为联圈饲养，由两个饲养员养，管理反而比以前精细了，仅二十天便把七头三类猪喂成了一类猪。
    现在，万安公社各生产队都因地制宜地推广了上述一些方法，使后勤工作面貌一新，样样事情有安排，工作质量也有提高，促使集中在生产第一线的劳力生产干劲普遍提高。
