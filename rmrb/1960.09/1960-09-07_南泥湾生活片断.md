Life Fragments from Nanniwan
Major General of the Chinese People's Liberation Army He Weizhong

A Great Call
From May 1939, the Kuomintang army began to build five lines of blockade around the border region, consisting of trenches, walls, and fortresses, stretching from Ningxia in the west, along the Jing River in the south, to the Yellow River in the east, spanning several provinces. These blockades tightly surrounded the border region, cutting off its transportation and economic exchanges with the outside world, causing significant economic difficulties. However, the reactionary Jiang Jieshi clique was not satisfied with blockade, encirclement, and attacks, and launched two anti-communist upsurges in succession from the winter of 1939 to the beginning of 1941.

Frankly speaking, we didn't take the enemy's military offensives seriously. If they dared to come, we would fight them. However, the enemy's economic blockade did add a lot of difficulties for us. For a period of time, we were almost at the serious point of having no clothes to wear, no food to eat, and no daily necessities to use.

In order to reverse this difficult situation and smash the enemy's economic blockade, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao timely put forward the call of "Develop production, self-reliance." This was a great and revolutionary call. As soon as this call was made, it was warmly responded to by the military and civilians of the border region.

At this time, our 359th Brigade had just been transferred back to northern Shaanxi from the North China front to defend the border region and the Party Central Committee, and was stationed in the areas of Suide, Mizhi, Jiaxian, and Wubao. After Brigade Commander Wang Zhen arranged the troops, he immediately went to Yan'an to report and ask for instructions from the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu gave us many important instructions on the issue of troops participating in production, which impressed us the most. Brigade Commander Wang Zhen expressed his attitude, saying: "We resolutely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and guarantee to achieve self-sufficiency in production for the entire brigade without affecting combat and training tasks."

Arrival at Nanniwan
In 1941, the 359th Brigade and the artillery regiment directly under the headquarters successively entered Nanniwan, Jinpenwan, Jiulongquan, Mafang, and Linzhen. Following them, some immigrants came from Yulin, Shenmu, Hengshan, Jiaxian and other places. This place, which had been deserted for eighty or ninety years, became active. The forests and cliffs were filled with troops, and the few dilapidated old cave dwellings became our good offices. In the morning, the smoke from the kitchen chimneys, permeating the valleys and forests, seemed like a fog over the ocean. At night, the mountains and fields were dotted with flickering lights, like the night scene of a city viewed from an airplane. After a day's labor, people gathered around the campfire to sing, tell stories, and chat. Some talked about the battle stories of climbing snow-capped mountains, crossing grasslands, and fighting devils in central Hebei, while others vividly described the happy scenes after the victory of the revolution.

When we first arrived in Nanniwan, on the one hand, we had to seize the time to reclaim wasteland in order to catch up with the season and sow on time; on the other hand, we urgently needed to solve the housing problem for the troops. At that time, most of the troops lived in thatched sheds temporarily built with branches, and some even camped in the wilderness. Dense leaves provided shelter from the rain, and tall weeds provided shelter from the wind. After digging the ground, the comrades lay down in their nests in the deep grass and forest, dreaming sweet dreams. Although life was hard, when the comrades recalled the difficult years of the domestic revolutionary war, when the enemy besieged the revolutionary base areas and during the Long March of the Red Army, when they often used dense forests as "barracks," the places with the most thatch as "beds," and dry grass and straw as "quilts," they felt that the difficulties before them were nothing. Some comrades jokingly said: "Zhuge Liang's thatched cottage is not necessarily more comfortable than our nests!" This caused everyone to burst into laughter.

In order to change this situation of living in the forest and camping in the wilderness, the brigade leaders and responsible comrades of each regiment decided to concentrate forces on digging cave dwellings while grasping wasteland reclamation, and put forward the slogan of "Build our positions, build our homes."

The cave-digging project began. The brigade and regimental leaders and all the comrades were busy every day, looking at the terrain and looking for places to dig cave dwellings from one mountain to another. The comrades who dug the cave dwellings got up before dawn and went to work in the soil. When the closing signal sounded, everyone came out of the cave dwellings covered in mud. If you didn't look carefully, you couldn't tell who was Zhang San and who was Li Si. Especially in the summer, the sun was both poisonous and hot, and digging cave dwellings was even more difficult. In order to save clothes, everyone only wore shorts and fought with the soil, covered in sweat, and the soil stuck to them, turning them into mud men. In the summer, there were also many mosquitoes and horseflies. Working with bare bodies, they were often bitten, and many itchy and painful bumps grew on their bodies.

Due to the strenuous physical labor of the troops, it was particularly necessary to improve the food. However, at that time, this was not an easy task! Grain, oil, and salt all needed to be transported by manpower from a hundred or even hundreds of miles away. Sometimes, each person had to carry firewood to sell. When carrying grain, if there were not enough cloth bags, the soldiers would tie up their pants to use as bags. Along the way, they had to pass through fields full of scorpion grass, wolf teeth thorns, miscellaneous short trees, and dense forests, five or six feet high. Although there were occasionally a few sheep intestines trails in the middle, they were covered with weeds and thorns due to long-term disuse, making it very difficult to walk. Once, a few days before the near year, because the troops lacked food, Chen Zongyao, the head of the 718th regiment, personally led the soldiers through the ice and snow to extend the food. On the way back through the Yan River, he did not hesitate to break the ice and wade across, which deeply moved the soldiers. Therefore, although some comrades fell on the snow, no one complained, saying: "The regiment leader is like this, we can't complain even more." Sometimes, Regiment Commander Chen would also propose to compete with everyone on the road to see who could walk faster. Therefore, under the influence of Regiment Commander Chen's exemplary actions, the morale of the comrades was always high. The villagers along the way were touched when they saw this grain-carrying troop, and said: "You Eighth Route Army are really too hard. We should have delivered it, but you came to carry it!" "In the Kuomintang period, we couldn't even deliver it!"

Although the food was guaranteed, eating vegetables was also a big problem. At that time, it was impossible to rely on killing pigs to "improve the food". They could only rely on the comrades to go up the mountain to hunt. In fact, it was not difficult to eat meat. In summer, the feathers of the mountain chickens fell off, and before they grew new feathers, they could often be chased and caught by running. If done well, the meat of the mountain chicken was really fragrant, and you would want to eat it again after eating it. If they could hunt a wild boar or wild sheep, they could greatly improve the food. We also didn't let go of the rivers and ditches, where there were fish, turtles, shrimps, and crabs. The bugler Wei Shaokun grew up by the water since he was a child. He was best at fishing and catching shrimps. As long as he went into the water for an hour or two, he would come up with either a basin full of small fish or several "turtles," and he was sure to not come up empty-handed. There were also ways to eat eggs. Summer was the egg-laying season for mountain chickens. Before the chicks hatched, if you could find a nest in the weeds, there would be at least a dozen, enough for a few people to have a good meal.

Brigade Commander Wang Zhen was from Hunan and knew how to make several southern dishes. He often went to the kitchen to guide the cooks in making dishes, and even did it himself. Loach, yellow eel fried with wild celery, and leopard meat fried with chili peppers became recognized delicacies.

It was not difficult to like to drink tea, boil licorice and plantain grass to drink, which was both quenching and relieved internal heat. A kind of yellow celery grass can be made into tea after distillation. After drinking it, it can also help digestion.

In fact, some of the problems encountered in life were only part of the whole difficulty. In the process of wasteland reclamation and production, we overcame more and more difficult difficulties.

As the ancient saying goes: "If a worker wants to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools." We deeply realized the meaning of this sentence in the agricultural production process in 1940. Originally, we had only one hoe on average for every two or three people, and there were very few other tools. After arriving here, facing such a large task of wasteland reclamation, of course, the tools were even more insufficient. Therefore, Brigade Commander Wang Zhen put forward the call for each person to have a hoe, each unit to have four plows, and eight cattle, and ordered the supply organs at all levels to be responsible for preparation. However, the funds were limited, and simply relying on buying with money could not solve the problem. Therefore, it was still necessary to take the mass line and rely on everyone to find solutions. All those that could be processed and manufactured by ourselves would not be bought. We would also try to use scrap iron to exchange for those that we could not manufacture. When we had no choice, we would buy them with money. We often carried the salt we produced to the Yellow River coast to exchange one and a half catties of salt for one catty of iron, and hired workers on the spot to make it. I remember that at that time, there was an old broken bell on a small mountain near our station that was half buried in the ground, and Liu, the company commander of our guard company, led everyone to carry it back to smelt iron and make tools. As for small utensils such as dung baskets, shoulder poles, and ropes, all were solved by the companies themselves. The soldiers used willow and elm strips to weave dung baskets, and a skilled worker could weave four or five a day. The soldiers praised these tools for being helpful and easy to use, saying: "With them, we can turn barren mountains into fertile fields."

Wasteland Reclamation Craze
Because there had been no inhabitants in the Nanniwan area for a long time, it was not easy to find a cultivated land to plant here. Even if we occasionally found a piece of land with traces of previous cultivation, it was now desolate. Therefore, if we wanted to develop agricultural production here, the primary task was to reclaim wasteland. At that time, wasteland reclamation mainly relied on two hands and a hoe, which was considered the most difficult and arduous task in our entire production process.

Every day, at the crack of dawn, the comrades got up and, led by the unit leaders, marched towards the barren mountains while humming the folk songs they had composed themselves, such as "Start work early, ho hey, three early shifts equal one shift..." "Start work in the morning, hey ho, keep digging until the sun sets..."

The comrades were very enthusiastic about reclaiming wasteland. Sometimes, when the cook came to deliver food, the production team leader would give everyone a goal in front and say: "Comrades, work harder and dig to the front of XX place to eat." So the hoes fell like raindrops. If the front was a little slower, the back would shout: "Faster in the front, you are digging on my leg!" In a short while, a new piece of land would be opened up. Sometimes, as soon as they finished their meal, many comrades would pick up their hoes and dig. The leading comrades asked them to rest more, but they always refused, saying: "It doesn't matter, let's do it! Young lads, what are we afraid of!" Often, before the whistle to start work sounded, they would all start working automatically. Whenever it was time to stop work, new "charges" were often launched. Someone here suggested: "Let's work for five more minutes!" Someone there said: "Let's attack another piece of land!" In this way, they sometimes attacked a mountain ridge in one go.

Most of the wasteland here was wolf teeth thorns land, scorpion grass land, old wormwood land, cat grass land, and sheep beard grass land. These wastelands were both difficult and hard to dig. Sometimes, it took a long time to cut down a pile of bushes and dig out its roots. Especially wolf teeth thorns and saplings, if you are not careful, the saplings will hit your face and hands, or the thorns will pierce your clothes and flesh. Some comrades had never reclaimed wasteland before and did not use the tools correctly. After working for a day, their hands were covered with blood blisters. However, the morale of the soldiers was always high, and no one complained, and no one was willing to lag behind.

In the process of wasteland reclamation, the comrades not only had high enthusiasm, but also created many methods. For example, some units grasped the characteristics of the "enemy" and invented a "fire attack" tactic. That is, whenever they encountered wasteland with deep grass and many thorns, they would set fire to the weeds and thorns before reclaiming the wasteland. In an instant, the mountains were full of smoke and fire, roaring in the wind. Where the wind and fire passed, a black, flat ground appeared. This not only saved the time of wasteland reclamation and the labor of the comrades, but also applied a layer of black fertilizer to our "virgin land" waiting to be cultivated. When reclaiming wasteland on flat ground, there was a "pack encirclement" tactic, that is, everyone first started from the surrounding area and progressed towards the center. As the encirclement became smaller and smaller, everyone's mood became higher and higher, until the wasteland was eliminated. When reclaiming wasteland on the mountains, they adopted the "breakthrough from the middle" tactic, that is, they first selected a point from the bottom of the mountain and dug upward, first splitting the wasteland into two pieces, and then developing to both sides, dividing the large pieces into small pieces, and finally "breaking through each one." This would not scare the soldiers with a large piece of wasteland all at once, giving them confidence to work.

In the wasteland reclamation and production, the cadres set an example and worked with the soldiers, which not only played a positive role in promoting the relationship, but also closely linked the relationship between superiors and subordinates and comrades. Comrade Zuo Qi, the political commissar of the 718th regiment, lost his right arm in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and could not participate in wasteland reclamation, but he was not willing to stand outside the production line. Whenever he had time, he would help the cooks boil water and cook, for fear of delaying the meal time and making everyone hungry. He often carried loads to the mountains to deliver water to the soldiers. Everyone felt that they had gained new strength after drinking the water he delivered. Political Commissar Zuo sometimes used his own allowance to buy some red dates for everyone to make date cakes. When the comrades ate the fragrant and delicious date cakes, they were all moved by Political Commissar Zuo's actions, which aroused unparalleled enthusiasm for labor. Comrade Chen Waiou, the head of the 717th Regiment, although his left hand was disabled, still led his guards together with Political Commissar Li Quan and the deputy regiment leader and chief of staff to form a separate production group and carry out wasteland reclamation and production like ordinary soldiers. Because the station was far from the wasteland, they moved to the mountain to live and put the phone on the mountain. They participated in wasteland reclamation during the day and worked on the mountain at night. The mountain they were responsible for reclaiming was not only large in area, but also overgrown with vegetation. At first glance, it made you feel that you couldn't start at all. People who were not determined would be frightened by this difficulty, but none of them were timid. In the first battle, they first came to a "fire attack on Cao's camp," completely annihilating the enemy's "830,000 troops," and then cleaned up the "battlefield" and selected the site for wasteland reclamation.

In the booming wasteland reclamation craze, the cadres' family members also refused to lag behind, and they also contributed their own strength to wasteland reclamation and production. In addition to spinning yarn themselves to solve their own and their children's food and clothing, they would help the soldiers wash and sew whenever they had time. The cadres' family members of the replenishment regiment also held a meeting and made a resolution, requesting that they be washed clean and sewn firmly; those with skillful hands should also make the repairs look good; make up for the delayed spinning tasks in the future; those with many children can wash and repair clothes for nearby soldiers; those without children and strong bodies can go to more distant units to wash and repair clothes for soldiers. This was most deeply felt by the new soldiers who had just been liberated from the puppet army. They said: "Our Eighth Route Army, the men farm the land, the women spin yarn, and they also help us wash and sew. It is really a revolutionary big family."

    南泥湾生活片断
    中国人民解放军少将　何维忠	伟大的号召
    从1939年5月，国民党军队开始在边区周围，修筑起五道由沟墙和堡垒构成的封锁线，西起宁夏，南沿泾水，东迄黄河，绵亘数省。这些封锁线紧紧地包围住边区，隔断边区和外界的交通及经济上的来往，使边区经济发生了很大的困难。但是，蒋介石反动集团还不以封锁、包围、袭击为满足，又在1939年冬至1941年初，连续发动了两次反共高潮。
    说实在的，对于敌人的军事进攻，我们并未放在眼里，他敢来，我们就揍他；而对于敌人在经济方面的封锁，的确给我们增添了不少困难。有一段时间，我们几乎到了没有衣穿、没有粮吃、没有日用品用的严重地步。
    为了扭转这种困难的局面，粉碎敌人的经济封锁，党中央和毛主席及时提出了“发展生产、自力更生”的号召。这是一个伟大的、革命的号召。这个号召一提出，立刻受到边区全体军民的热烈响应。
    这时，我们三五九旅为了保卫边区、保卫党中央，刚由华北前线调回陕北不久，驻在绥德、米脂、葭县、吴堡一带。王震旅长把部队安排好以后，立即赴延安向党中央、毛主席和朱总司令汇报和请示工作。对于部队参加生产问题，毛主席和朱总司令曾给了我们许多重要的指示，使我们印象最深刻。王震旅长表示态度说：“我们坚决响应党中央和毛主席的号召，保证在不影响战斗、训练任务的情况下，做到全旅生产自给。”
        初到南泥湾
    1941年，三五九旅和总部直属炮兵团先后开进南泥湾、金盆湾、九龙泉、马坊、临镇一带。接着，又从榆林、神木、横山、葭县等地来了一些移民。这块寂寞了八、九十年的地方活跃起来了。树林里、山崖下到处住满了部队，仅有的几个破烂不堪的旧窑洞，成了我们很好的办公室。早上，迷漫在山谷和树林上的炊烟，好像蒙在海洋上的一片雾气。晚上，满山遍野闪亮着若明若暗的灯火，好像在飞机上俯视城市的夜景。一天劳动之后，人们都围坐在篝火旁边说唱、聊天，他们有的谈着爬雪山、过草地和在冀中打鬼子的战斗故事，有的则津津有味地描述着革命胜利后的幸福情景。
    我们初到南泥湾的时候，一方面必须抓紧时间开荒，以便赶上季节，按时播种；一方面还迫切需要解决部队的住房问题。当时，大部分部队都住在临时用树枝搭起的草棚里，有的甚至露营在野地上。避雨是茂密的树叶，遮风是齐眉的野草。挖地归来，同志们就躺在这个深草丛林中的窝铺里，做着香甜的梦。生活虽然艰苦，但同志们一想起当年国内革命战争时期，敌人围攻革命根据地和红军长征时期那些艰苦的岁月，那种常以茂密森林为“军营”，以茅柴最多之处为“床铺”，以枯草和禾草当“被盖”的情景，眼前的一些困难，就都觉着不算什么了。有些同志逗趣地说：“诸葛亮的茅庐还不一定能比上我们的窝铺舒服哩！”这时就惹得大家哄然大笑。
    为了改变这种栖息树林、露宿旷野的情况，旅首长和各团负责同志决定在抓紧开荒的同时，抽出一定的力量突击打窑，提出了“建造我们的阵地，建造我们的家园”的口号。
    打窑工程开始了。旅、团首长和全体同志们一样，成天紧张地忙碌着，从这架山到那架山，察看地形，寻找打窑洞的地点。打窑的同志们天不亮就都起来钻到泥土里去工作。当收工号响后，大家走出窑洞的时候，满身都是泥土，如果你不仔细辨认，你就分辨不出谁是张三谁是李四来。尤其是夏天，太阳光既毒又热，挖窑工作更是辛苦。为了节省衣服，大家只穿一条短裤，和泥土搏斗，浑身上下到处都是汗水，土粘上去把人变成了泥人。夏天蚊子、牛虻又特别多，光着身子劳动，身上经常被叮，长了许多又痒又痛的大疙瘩。
    由于部队进行紧张繁重的体力劳动，特别需要改善伙食。但是，在当时这却是一件不容易办好的事情！粮食、油盐都需要组织人力到一百里甚至百里以外去背。有时每人还要背上柴禾去卖。背粮时布口袋不够用，战士就将自己的裤子扎起来当口袋用。一路上，要穿过遍地长满五、六尺高的蝎子草、狼牙刺，杂七杂八的矮丛树，和密密层层的大树林。中间虽偶尔有几条羊肠小道，也因长期无人行走，已长满荒草荆棘，行走十分困难。有一次在逼近年节的前几天，因为部队缺乏粮食，七一八团陈宗尧团长就亲自冒着冰天雪地，带领战士去延长背粮。在回来经过延水时，他毫不犹豫地首先破冰涉水走了过去，使战士们深受感动。因此，虽然有些同志在雪地上摔了跤，但从没有人叫苦，都说：“团长都这样，我们更不能叫苦了。”有时陈团长在路上还提出和大家竞赛，比比看谁走得快。因此同志们在陈团长的模范行动的影响下，情绪始终是高涨的。沿途老乡看到这支背粮部队，都感动地说：“你们八路军真太辛苦了，本来我们应该送的，你们却来背了！”“要在国民党时期，我们送还送不赢呢！”
    粮食虽算有了保证，但吃菜也是个大问题。当时“打牙祭”指望杀猪是办不到的，只有靠同志们上山猎取。其实想吃肉也并不难，夏天山鸡的翅毛都褪落了，在没有换新毛以前常常可以跑步追捕它。要是做得好，山鸡肉可真香，管叫你吃后还想吃。如果能猎取一只野猪或野羊回来，那就可以大大改善一下伙食。河沟、水渠我们也没有放过，那里是鱼、鳖、虾、蟹，样样都有。司号员韦少坤是从小就在水边上长大的。他最会摸鱼捞虾，只要他下水搞个把钟头，上来不是一脸盆小鱼，就是几只“王八”，保险不会落空。想吃鸡蛋也有办法，夏天是山鸡生卵期，在还未孵出小鸡之前，如果你能在野草间找到一窠，起码有十几个，足够几个人美美的吃他一餐。
    王震旅长是湖南人，很会做几样南方菜，他常到伙房指导炊事员做菜，甚至亲自动手。泥鳅、黄鳝煎野芹菜，豹子肉炒辣椒，成为大家公认的美味。
    爱吃茶叶也不难，挖些甘草和车前草煎水喝，又解渴又泄火。有一种黄芹草经过蒸馏后，可制成茶叶，泡水喝了后，还能帮助消化。
    其实生活中所遇到的一些问题，只是整个困难中的一部分，在开荒生产过程中，我们克服了更多、更艰巨的困难。
    古语云：“工欲善其事，必先利其器。”我们在1940年的农业生产过程中，就深深体会到了这句话的意思。原来我们两三个人才平均一把镢头，其它工具也很少。来到这里之后，面对这样大的开荒任务，工具当然就更显得不够了。因此王震旅长就提出每人一把镢头、一把锄头，每个单位四犋犁、八头耕牛的号召，并责成各级供给机关负责筹备。但是经费是有限的，单纯依靠拿钱购买远不能解决问题，因此，这仍然得走群众路线，靠大家想办法解决。凡是自己能够加工制造的一律不买，自己不能制造的也尽量利用废铁换，不得已时再拿钱买。我们常把自己生产的食盐驮到黄河沿岸一带，用一斤半盐交换一斤铁，并就地请工人打造。记得当时在我们驻地附近的一个小山上有一口半截被埋在地下的老破钟，也被我们警卫连刘连长带领大家将它抬了回来炼铁打成了工具。至于粪筐、扁担、绳子等小用具，全由各连队自行解决。战士们利用柳条、榆条编粪筐，熟练的一天就能编四、五个。战士们都夸奖这些工具得力顺手，说：“有了它们管叫荒山变良田。”
        开荒热潮
    南泥湾一带由于长期没有人烟，在这里想找一块熟地耕种是不容易的，即或偶尔发现一块土地有被前人耕种过的痕迹，但现在也荒芜得不成样子了。因此要想在这里发展农业生产，首要任务就是开荒。开荒在当时主要是靠两只手一把镢头，这在我们整个生产过程中，要算一项最艰巨、最困难的任务。
    每天，天麻麻亮，同志们就起床，在单位首长的率领下，边走边哼着“早上工呀呼嗨，三个早工顶一个工……”“从早上工哪呀呼嗨，一直挖到太阳落……”自编的秧歌小调向荒山进军。
    同志们开荒热情很高。有时，炊事员送饭来了，生产组长就给大家在前面指定一个目标说：“同志们，再加一把油，挖到前面××地就吃饭。”于是镢头就像雨点一样叭叭直落，前面稍为慢一点，后面就喊道：“前面快些，挖到你的腿了！”片刻之间就开辟出一块新地来。有时，刚一开罢饭，就有很多同志拿起镢头掘起来，领队同志要他们多休息一会，他们总是不肯，说：“不要紧，干吧！年轻小伙子，怕什么！”常常未等开工的哨子响，就都自动地干起来了。每当收工的时候，也常常要掀起几个新的“冲锋”，这里有人提议：“再干五分钟！”那里有人说：“再突击一块地！”就这样，有时一股劲就突击一个山峁。
    这里的荒地大多是狼牙刺地、蝎子草地、老蒿子地、猫儿草地和羊胡子草地等。这些荒地开起来既费劲又不好挖，有时为了砍掉一堆丛树，挖掉它的根，就要花很长时间。特别是狼牙刺和梢林，一不留神，就会被梢子打了脸和手，或被刺戳破衣服和肉。有的同志没有开过荒，拿工具方法不对头，搞了一天之后就打了满手血泡。但战士们的情绪始终是高昂的，谁也不叫苦，谁也不肯落后一步。
    同志们在开荒中不仅有高度的热情，而且还创造了不少的办法。如有的单位抓住了“敌人”的特点，发明了一种“火攻”战术。即凡遇草深、荆棘多的荒地，开荒之前先把荒草荆棘点燃，顷刻间，满山烟火，迎风呼啸，风火过去之处，就出现一片片黑越越的平地。这样不仅节省了开荒的时间与同志们的劳动，而且还给我们待耕种的“处女地”上施了一层黑黝黝的肥料。在平地开荒时有一种“打包围”的战术，就是大家首先从周围开始，向中心进展。包围圈愈来愈缩小，大家情绪也就愈来愈高，一直到消灭这块荒地为止。在山地上开荒就采用“从中突破”的战术，这就是先从山下选择一点向上挖去，先把荒地分裂为两块，然后再向两边发展，把大块分成小块，最后“各个突破”。这样就不会一下子被大块荒地吓住，使战士们干起来有信心。
    在开荒生产中，干部都以身作则，和广大战士一起生产劳动，这不仅起了积极的推动作用，而且密切了上下级和同志间的关系。七一八团政委左齐同志，在抗日战争中失去了右臂，不能参加开荒，但他也不肯站到生产战线之外，他一有空就帮着炊事员烧水做饭，唯恐误了吃饭时间使大家挨了饿。他经常挑着担子到山上去给战士们送水，大家喝了他送的水，都感到增添了新的力量。左政委有时还拿自己的津贴，买些红枣给大家作枣糕吃，当同志们吃着那香甜可口的枣糕时，都为左政委这种行动感动了，激起了无比的劳动热情。七一七团团长陈外欧同志，虽然左手残废，但仍和李铨政委以及副团长、参谋长等带领着他们的警卫员单独组织生产小组，和普通战士一样进行开荒生产。因驻地离荒地远，他们就搬到山上住，把电话架在山上。白天参加开荒，晚上就在山上办公。他们八个人负责开垦的这一架山，不仅面积大，而且草木丛生，乍一看，简直叫你觉得无法下手，决心不大的人，就会被这种困难吓倒，可是他们几个人谁也不胆怯。第一仗，他们先来了个“火烧曹营”，全歼了敌人“八十三万人马”，接着就打扫“战场”，选择场地进行开荒。
    在轰轰烈烈的开荒热潮中，干部家属也不甘落后，她们为开荒生产同样贡献了自己的力量。她们除了自己纺纱，解决自己和孩子的吃穿以外，一有时间就去帮助战士们洗洗缝缝。补充团的干部家属们，为这事还开会作了决议，要求洗干净，补结实；手巧的人还要补得好看；耽误了的纺纱任务，以后补上；孩子多的可为附近战士洗补衣服；没有孩子，身体又强的，可去较远的单位为战士洗补衣服。这一点，对于刚从伪军解放过来的新战士感受最深，他们说：“我们八路军，男的种地，女的纺纱，又帮我们洗洗缝缝，真是个革命的大家庭。”
