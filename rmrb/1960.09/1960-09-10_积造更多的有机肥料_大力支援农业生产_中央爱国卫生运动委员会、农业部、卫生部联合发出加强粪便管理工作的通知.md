Xinhua News Agency, September 8th: The Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Health jointly issued a notice on the 5th to relevant departments in all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions regarding strengthening the management of feces, garbage, and sewage, as well as snail eradication and the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis in livestock.

The notice stated: Human and animal feces are the most widely used and highly effective organic fertilizers in agricultural production. Garbage and sewage also contain a large amount of fertilizer and are the main sources of fertilizer accumulation. However, if they are not managed well or handled improperly, the fertilizer efficiency will be greatly reduced, and it will also hinder environmental sanitation, breed flies and mosquitoes, and spread various diseases (such as schistosomiasis, hookworm disease, ascariasis, dysentery, typhoid fever, hepatitis, and livestock diseases). In recent years, many regions, starting from production, have combined the fertilizer accumulation movement with the patriotic health movement and have achieved good results.

The notice stated that in order to implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, accumulate more organic fertilizer, vigorously support agricultural production, and improve environmental sanitation, it is hoped that all regions will closely integrate with the central task of production and further strengthen the management of human and animal feces, garbage, and sewage, and include it in the current fertilizer accumulation plan. To this end, the following tasks are required to be done well:

    I. Strengthen the organizational work of fertilizer accumulation to combine the responsibility of dedicated personnel for fertilizer accumulation, production, and environmental sanitation with the mass movement, and establish a regular management system.
    In rural areas, each natural village or production team should organize a certain force to be responsible for fertilizer accumulation. In addition to collecting and transporting human and animal feces, and accumulating green manure and soil fertilizer, their tasks should also include the sanitary management of public and private toilets, manure yards, and manure ponds, and the harmless treatment of feces and garbage. In urban areas, cleaning teams and fertilizer stations can be established to be responsible for collecting and transporting urban feces and garbage and carrying out harmless treatment, so that urban and rural feces and garbage can be produced and cleared daily, to achieve more fertilizer accumulation, good fertilizer accumulation, and harmless treatment in combination with maintaining and improving fertilizer efficiency. Continuous political and ideological education and training in fertilizer accumulation and hygiene knowledge should be carried out for fertilizer accumulation team members and cleaning team members, and they should be mobilized to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution on a large scale.

    II. Establish manure yards, manure ponds, or manure depots in a planned way to store feces and garbage centrally for harmless treatment, and gradually change the habit of drying manure and using fresh manure to irrigate the land.
    Each production team in rural areas should establish an appropriate number of manure yards or manure ponds (manure ponds should have covers) on the side of the fields or villages in coordination with high-yield prescriptions and pig farms, as a base for fertilizer accumulation and harmless treatment. Cities should establish an appropriate number of manure yards or manure depots in the suburbs as places for centralized storage and harmless treatment of urban feces and garbage.
    Harmless treatment can be carried out by using mud-sealed composting, closed manure storage, and pit composting, etc., according to the needs of production, fertilization habits, fertilizer source conditions, and seasonal characteristics. By using these methods, on the one hand, bacteria and insect eggs can be killed through fermentation to control the breeding of flies and the spread and prevalence of diseases; on the other hand, organic matter can be rapidly decomposed into humus, which is easy for crops to absorb and improves the soil's ability to retain water and fertilizer. To avoid the contradiction between the urgent need for fertilizer and harmless treatment, all localities should make plans for the whole year's fertilizer use and fertilizer accumulation, and gradually achieve planned fertilizer use.

    III. Further improve the construction and improvement of toilets and livestock pens to eliminate the phenomenon of indiscriminate defecation and loss of manure.

    IV. Garbage and sewage should be used as fertilizer as much as possible.
    Garbage should be classified, and organic garbage must be transported to manure yards or manure depots as fertilizer and used as raw materials for mud-sealed composting or composting. Sewage from cities and industrial and mining areas should be properly treated and then used to irrigate farmland, so that crops can receive both water and fertilizer, and sewage can be naturally purified. Areas that use sewage to irrigate farmland should strive to achieve comprehensive utilization throughout the year as soon as possible to avoid sewage pollution of water sources. Rural sewage should also be properly treated in combination with fertilizer accumulation.

    V. In addition to doing the above tasks well, areas with schistosomiasis should also strengthen snail eradication and the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis in livestock to completely eliminate the source of schistosomiasis infection.
    In terms of snail eradication, it is necessary to further ascertain the area of ​​snail distribution, conscientiously promote the experience of large-scale snail eradication, and carry out snail eradication to the end in combination with basic farmland construction, water conservancy construction, and land reclamation. Snail eradication should be carried out in conjunction with agricultural production, and the knowledge of snail eradication should be actively publicized and taught to the broad masses of people so that the broad masses of farmers can understand snail eradication knowledge.
    The prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis in livestock should be further developed in conjunction with other livestock disease prevention and control work. Areas where the epidemic situation has not been clarified should first conduct a general survey and implement side-investigation, side-isolation, and side-treatment. Areas that have already undergone general investigation and treatment should seize the time to re-examine and treat again. In addition to draft cattle, pigs, sheep, horses and other livestock should also be inspected and treated in areas where manpower and material resources are available. Attention should also be paid to training veterinarians and anti-epidemic personnel in people's communes so that they can master the general techniques of inspecting and preventing and treating schistosomiasis in livestock.

The notice finally requires relevant departments in all localities to combine production and make overall arrangements under the unified leadership of the Party committee. Propaganda should be done well; scientific and technical personnel should be mobilized and organized to go deep into the masses to strengthen technical guidance, and the exchange and promotion of advanced experience should be grasped so that this work can be rapidly unfolded.

    积造更多的有机肥料  大力支援农业生产
    中央爱国卫生运动委员会、农业部、卫生部联合发出加强粪便管理工作的通知
    新华社8日讯　中央爱国卫生运动委员会、农业部、卫生部在5日联合向各省市自治区有关部门发出了关于加强粪便垃圾污水管理和灭螺、防治家畜血吸虫病的通知。
    通知说：人畜粪便是农业生产上使用最广泛的肥效很高的有机肥料，垃圾和污水也含有大量肥分，是积肥造肥的主要来源。但是，如果管理不好，处理不当，就会大大损失肥效，而且妨碍环境卫生，孳生苍蝇蚊子、传播多种疾病（如血吸虫病、钩虫病、蛔虫病、痢疾、伤寒、肝炎和牲畜疫病）。近几年来，许多地区从生产出发，把积肥造肥运动和爱国卫生运动结合起来，已经取得了很好的效果。
    通知说，为了贯彻以农业为基础的方针，积造更多的有机肥料，大力支援农业生产，为了搞好环境卫生，希望各地紧密结合生产中心，进一步把人畜粪便和垃圾污水的管理工作狠狠地抓起来，列入当前积肥造肥的规划。为此要求做好以下几项工作：
    一、加强积肥造肥的组织工作，使积肥、造肥和搞好环境卫生的专人负责与广大群众性的运动相结合，建立起经常的管理制度。
    农村，每个自然村或生产队应组织一定力量负责积肥，他们的任务除了收集和搬运人畜粪便，积造青肥土肥外，并应负责公私厕所、粪场、粪池的卫生管理，和对粪便垃圾进行无害化处理。城镇中可成立清洁队和肥料站，负责收集和搬运城镇粪便垃圾以及作无害化处理。使城乡粪便垃圾都做到日产日清，达到多积肥，积好肥，并结合保持和提高肥效实现无害化处理。对积肥队员和清洁队员要不断进行政治思想教育和积肥卫生知识训练，并且发动他们大搞技术革新和技术革命。
    二、有计划地建立粪场、粪池或粪库，使粪便垃圾集中贮存进行无害化处理，逐渐改变晒大粪干和用鲜粪浇地的习惯。
    农村每个生产队，应配合丰产方和养猪场在地头或村边建立适当数量的粪场或粪池（粪池要有盖），作为积肥造肥和进行无害化处理的基地。城市应在四郊建立适当数量的粪场或粪库，作为城市粪便垃圾集中贮存和进行无害化处理的场所。
    无害化处理，可以根据生产的需要，施肥的习惯，肥源的情况及季节特点，采用泥封堆肥、贮粪密闭和挖坑沤肥等办法。利用这些办法，一方面通过发酵杀灭病菌虫卵，控制苍蝇的孳生和疾病的传播流行；一方面促使有机质迅速分解为腐植质，便于庄稼吸收，并提高土壤的保水保肥能力。为避免急需用肥和无害化处理的矛盾，各地应做好全年用肥和积肥的规划，逐渐作到计划用肥。
    三、进一步做好厕所、牲畜栏圈的修建和改良工作，杜绝随地便溺和粪便流失的现象。
    四、垃圾污水要尽量利用作为肥料。
    垃圾要实行分类，有机垃圾一定要作为肥料运送到粪场或粪库，作为泥封堆肥或沤肥的原料。城市和工矿区的污水，应采取适当处理后灌溉农田，使农作物兼收水肥之效，使污水天然净化。利用污水灌溉农田地区应争取早日做到终年综合利用，以免污水污染水源。农村污水也要结合积肥造肥作到妥善处理。
    五、血吸虫病流行地区除要做好以上几项工作外，还要加强灭螺和防治家畜血吸虫病工作，以彻底铲除血吸虫病的传染源。
    在灭螺方面，要进一步查清钉螺的分布面积，认真推广大面积灭螺的经验，结合农田基本建设、兴修水利和垦荒等等活动，把灭螺工作进行到底。应该结合农业生产进行灭螺，并要积极向广大群众宣传和传授灭螺技术，使广大农民都懂得灭螺知识。
    防治家畜血吸虫病工作，要结合其他兽疫防治工作进一步地开展起来。未查明疫情的地区，首先要进行普查，实行边查、边隔离、边治。已经普查普治过的地区，要抓紧复查复治。除对耕牛外，在人力物力具备的地区，对猪、羊、马等家畜也要进行检查治疗。并注意培养人民公社的兽医和防疫员，使他们能够掌握检查与防治家畜血吸虫病的一般技术。
    通知最后要求各地有关部门在党委的统一领导下，结合生产，统筹安排。要作好宣传；要发动和组织科学技术人员深入群众加强技术指导，要抓紧交流和推广先进经验，使这项工作迅速展开。
