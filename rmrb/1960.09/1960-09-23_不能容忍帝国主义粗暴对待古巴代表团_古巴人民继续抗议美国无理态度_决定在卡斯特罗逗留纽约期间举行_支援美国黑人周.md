Xinhua News Agency, Havana, September 21st: Cuban people's organizations and people from all over the country continue to strongly protest the rude and discourteous attitude taken by American imperialism towards the Cuban delegation headed by Castro, which is attending the United Nations General Assembly.

The leaders of the Cuban Workers' Confederation and various trade union federations held a plenary session yesterday at the Plaza Civica, deciding to express their protest to the U.S. government and begin preparations for a grand rally to welcome the Cuban delegation's return home.

The "July 26th Movement" and the Federation of Cuban Women issued protest statements against the unreasonable attitude of the U.S. government.

In Holguín, militiamen and residents held a rally yesterday to protest against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and reaffirm their determination to defend national sovereignty. Trade unions, peasant organizations, and other people's groups across the country have also held protest rallies. At a meeting of two thousand workers at the Covatonga sugar mill, it was decided to approve the Havana Declaration and protest the rude and discourteous attitude of the U.S. authorities towards the Cuban delegation. The Frank País Farmers Association and the National Union of University Workers also made the same decision.

The Cuban Workers' Confederation has also decided to invite American Black leaders and the manager of the Black-owned hotel where the Cuban delegation is staying to visit Cuba to express the Cuban people's gratitude to them. The Cuban National Unity Movement decided to hold a "Support American Black People Week" during Castro's stay in the Harlem area of New York to support their struggle for democratic rights.
