　　How to Predict Yield
　　Hua Luogeng
    Large tracts of crops are about to be harvested, and we hope to know in advance about how much the yield per mu will be, in order to review our production achievements of the past year and better achieve increased production and savings on the food front. In order to predict yields more quickly and accurately, here is a simple method. Of course, to verify yields more precisely, "estimation" cannot be used, and more detailed methods must be adopted. The estimation method is divided into the following five steps:
    1.  Division: Divide into several plots according to the different growth conditions of the crops. For example: if there are 120 mu of land, of which about 30 mu are dense and robust, about 60 mu are dense and somewhat lodging, and about 30 mu are sparse, then we divide it into three plots.
    2.  Square Selection: Select several square meters according to the area ratio of each plot. In the above example, select one square meter for the dense and robust part, two square meters for the dense part, and one square meter for the sparse part.
    3.  Grain Counting: That is, estimate the number of grains in each square. First count how many plants there are, then pull out several plants to calculate the average number of grains per plant, and multiply the two to get the number of grains in this square (estimated value).
    4.  Averaging: Add up the number of grains in all these squares, and then divide by the number of squares to get the average number of grains per square. In the above example, it is the average of four squares.
    5.  Conversion: Since one mu is equal to 666.7 square meters, for example, one jin of wheat is about 15,000 grains (note that this number must be determined according to the actual variety), the estimated value of the number of jin per mu can be obtained by multiplying the number of grains per square meter by 666.7 and dividing by 15,000 (in actual calculation, since 666.7/15,000 = 4/90, the number of jin per mu can be obtained by multiplying by 4 and dividing by 90).
    6.  Reduction of Loss: There are often lost ears and grains during harvesting and transportation, and there are also losses during threshing, so loss reduction must be verified. Due to the different harvesting tools and the different levels of work detail, the percentage of loss reduction can be determined based on past experience. However, we should try our best to ensure that all grains are returned home and that no grain is lost.
    [Appendix] 1. For larger areas, aerial photography can be used to divide the area according to different sensitivities, and then samples can be taken on the ground for estimation using the same method.
    2.  A wooden frame (or sorghum stalk frame) can be used for square selection, with three sides fixed and one side movable for easy covering.
    3.  Some people first calculate the average number of plants, then calculate the average number of grains, and then multiply them to get the average number of grains per square. This is a biased method and not as good as the method introduced here. (Attached picture)

　　怎样预估产量
　　华罗庚
    大片庄稼即将开镰收割，我们希望预先知道每亩产量大约多少，以便检阅我们一年来的生产成绩，更好地在粮食战线上作到增产节约。为了比较迅速和比较准确地预估产量，这里有一个简便的方法。当然，要更精确地核实产量，就不能用“估算”，而必须采用更细致的方法了。估算的方法分为以下五步：
    1、分片：依照庄稼生长情况的不同，划分为若干片。例如：有地一百二十亩，其中密而茁壮的约占三十亩，密而有些倒伏的约占六十亩，稀疏的约三十亩，这样，我们就分为三片。
    2、选方：按片的面积比例，各选若干平方米。在上例中，密壮部分选一平方米，密的部分选二平方米，疏的部分选一平方米。
    3、计粒：即估计每一方中的粒数。先数有多少株，再拔若干株算出每株的平均粒数，两者相乘即得这一方的粒数（估值）。
    4、平均：将这些方的粒数总加起来，再以方数除之，即得一方的平均粒数，上例即由四方平均。
    5、折算：由于一亩等于666.7平方米，例如一斤麦子大约是一万五千粒（注意，此数须依实际品种确定），可以由每平方米的粒数乘以666.7，除以15，000，即得每亩的斤数估值（在实际计算时，由于666.7／15，000＝4／90，因此可用乘4除90得出每亩斤数）。
    6、减耗：在收割及搬运时常有遗穗遗粒，打场时也有损失，所以必须核减耗损。由于收割的工具不同，工作的粗细不一，可以根据以往的经验定出减耗百分数。不过我们应该尽量作到颗粒还家，不让粮食受到损失。
    〔附记〕1、更大的面积可用空中照相法，依感光度不同而分片，再在地上取样，用同法估算。
    2、选方可用木框（或高粱秆框），三边固定，一边活动，便于套上。
    3、有人先求株数平均，再求粒数平均，然后相乘，作为每方平均粒数。这是一个偏高的方法，没有这儿所介绍的方法好。（附图片）
