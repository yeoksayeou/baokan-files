    Labor in the Field, Learning in the Field, Applying What is Learned, Promoting Production
　　Linzhang Commune Runs Amateur Schools in High-Yield Fields

    (Reported by our newspaper) The Linzhang People's Commune in Cixian County, Hebei Province, has greatly promoted production by running farmers' amateur schools in high-yield fields, making full use of rural labor and adapting to the rural seasons. Over the past year, these schools have trained 120 junior technicians for the commune's 93 production teams. Using the schools as bases, they have promoted new agricultural technologies, experimented with new varieties, disseminated agricultural knowledge, and improved the technical management of high-yield fields.
    The establishment and development of high-yield fields require that the organizational forms of amateur education better adapt to them, in order to more quickly cultivate junior and intermediate agricultural technicians with socialist consciousness and certain cultural knowledge for agricultural technological transformation. As soon as the Linzhang People's Commune established high-yield fields, it set up amateur schools integrating politics, culture, and technology within the fields. Currently, the entire commune has established 95 high-yield fields, with 72% of the land allocated to these fields. The labor force entering the fields amounts to 15,200 people, including 11,250 young and middle-aged individuals. In these high-yield fields, every field has established a farmer's amateur school, with 98% of the young and middle-aged people enrolled. Running amateur schools in high-yield fields follows the principle of taking a long-term view, starting from the present, making unified arrangements, and facing production. It adopts the method of commune leadership, management district and production team management, establishing amateur central Red and Expert schools (led by the commune, located in large square fields), Red and Expert branch schools (run by the management district, located in medium-sized square fields), and amateur schools that combine inside and outside the fields. The central Red and Expert school is directly led by the commune Party committee, with 75 students divided into amateur primary school and amateur junior high school classes. Study time varies according to the season and the busy or slack periods of farm work, with classes suspended during the busy wheat and autumn harvests. The high-yield fields managed by the management districts have five Red and Expert branch schools, with a total of 316 students. In addition, the entire commune has 95 farmer amateur schools that combine inside and outside the high-yield fields, with 17,400 participants. These amateur schools are managed by the respective production teams.
    Because production in the square fields is in the form of specialized teams, running amateur schools in high-yield fields allows students to labor in the field and learn in the field, closely integrating theory with practice, and quickly improving their knowledge and technical levels. In the square fields, a portion of land is also allocated for students to conduct experiments on cultivating and breeding new varieties and creating high yields. Students also combine with teachers and experienced farmers to form scientific research offices. These studies and experiments focus on what the field needs, what is lacking, so that what they learn and experiment with can quickly guide production and promote production.
    The agricultural scientific research of the Red and Expert schools not only obtained new technologies and high-yield records in production, but also played a guiding role in various high-yield fields through the activities of the agricultural technology research office. When the wheat research group of the amateur school conducted a pest survey in the Xiguan production team, it discovered that wheat rust was occurring locally. It promptly reported to the commune and studied control methods, preventing the pest and disease from spreading and ensuring a good wheat harvest.
    Under the leadership of the commune Party committee, the central Red and Expert school provides demonstration guidance to the schools run by the management districts and production teams in terms of professional matters. The Red and Expert schools promptly report on the relevant teaching, scientific research and other aspects. At the same time, under the direct leadership of the commune Party committee, four stations for political theory instruction, agricultural technology guidance, in-service training for amateur teachers, and literary and artistic publicity guidance were established with the central Red and Expert school as the base, forming an amateur education network with four stations. These four stations are respectively composed of the commune's various departments, relevant business cadres from high-yield fields and management districts, and teachers from various branch schools in high-yield fields. They gather at the commune every ten to fifteen days to summarize and promote experiences, exchange business information, and arrange new tasks.
    The commune Party committee attaches great importance to the work of running schools in high-yield fields. In the early stage of running schools in high-yield fields, some difficulties and obstacles were encountered, but thanks to the Party's strong leadership and resolute support, the running of schools in high-yield fields was consolidated and developed. The commune Party committee allocated leadership and full-time teachers to the amateur schools in each high-yield field. The Party committee secretary often gives political lessons at the school, farms experimental fields with the students, and cares about the students' learning, life, and work conditions.

    劳动在方　学习在方　学以致用　推动生产
　　临漳公社在丰产方办业余学校
    本报讯　河北省磁县临漳人民公社，在充分提高农村劳动力的利用率、与农村季节相适应的原则下，在丰产方内大办农民业余学校，有力地推动了生产。一年多来，这些学校已给全社九十三个生产队培养出一百二十名初级技术人材，并以学校为基地，进行农业新技术推广、新品种试验，传播农业知识，提高了丰产方的农业技术管理水平。
    丰产方的建立和发展，要求业余教育的学习组织形式更好地与之相适应，以更快地为农业技术改造培养有社会主义觉悟和一定文化知识的初级、中级农业技术人材。临漳人民公社一创办丰产方，就在方内建立起政治、文化、技术三结合的业余学校。现在，全社共建成了九十五个丰产方，72％的土地划进了丰产方，进方劳动力达一万五千二百人，其中青壮年一万一千二百五十人。在这些丰产方内，方方都建立了农民业余学校，入学青壮年占98％。在丰产方内办业余学校，是本着从远处着眼，从当前入手，统一安排，面向生产的原则，采取了公社领导，管理区和生产队管理的方法，办起业余中心红专学校
  （公社领导，设在大方田内）、红专分校（管理区办，设在中等方田内）和方内方外相结合的业余学校。中心红专学校，由公社党委直接领导，在校学员七十五人，分为业余小学和业余初中两个班。学习时间根据季节和农活忙闲有所不同，过麦过秋大忙时则停止上课。由管理区主管的丰产方，设有业余红专分校五处，共有学员三百一十六人。此外，丰产方内外相结合的农民业余学校，全公社共有九十五处，参加学习的一万七千四百人。这一类业余学校由各生产队主管。
    丰产方办业余学校，由于方田内的生产是专业队的形式，使学员们劳动在方，学习在方，使理论与实践紧密结合，学以致用，很快提高了学员的知识水平和技术水平。在方田内还给学生划出一部分土地，供学员进行培育和繁殖新品种、创高产的试验田。学员还和老师、老农结合，组成科学研究室。这些研究和试验围绕方内需要什么就学什么，缺什么就研究什么，使他们所学的、所试验的很快能指导生产，推动生产。
    红专学校的农业科学研究，不仅获得了生产上的新技术和高产新纪录，而且通过农业新技术研究室的活动，对各丰产田起了指导作用。业余学校里的小麦研究组，到西关生产队进行虫情调查时，发现小麦局部发生锈病，就及时反映给公社，并研究了除治方法，及时除治，未使虫病蔓延成灾，保证了小麦丰收。
    中心红专学校在公社党委的领导下，从业务上对各管理区、生产队领导办的学校进行示范指导。各红专学校及时逐级向上反映有关教学、科学研究等方面的情况。同时在公社党委直接领导下，以中心红专学校为基地，建立了政治理论传授、农业技术指导、业余教师进修和文艺宣传辅导四个站，形成一个业余教育网带四个站。这四站分别由公社的各主管部门和丰产方、管理区有关业务干部、丰产方各分校教师组成，每十到十五天到公社集会一次，总结推广经验，交流业务情况，布置新任务。
    公社党委对丰产方办学工作十分重视。丰产方办学出现初期，也曾遇到一些困难和障碍，但由于党的坚强领导，和坚决支持，使丰产方办学得以巩固和发展。公社党委为各丰产方业余学校调配了领导力量和专任教师，党委书记经常到学校讲政治课，和学员们在一起合种试验田，关心师生们的学习、生活和劳动情况。
