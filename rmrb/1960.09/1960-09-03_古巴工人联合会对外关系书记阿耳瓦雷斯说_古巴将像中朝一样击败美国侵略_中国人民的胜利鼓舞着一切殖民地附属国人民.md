Xinhua News Agency, Havana, August 31st: Alvarez de la Campa, Foreign Relations Secretary of the Cuban Workers' Union, strongly condemned the United States for forcing the Organization of American States member foreign ministers' meeting to pass a resolution against Cuba at a press conference held here today.

Alvarez refuted the fabricated slander in the resolution that the Western Hemisphere is facing "threats from outside the continent" and that the Soviet Union and China are "attempting to interfere in Latin America." He pointed out that the San Jose Foreign Ministers' meeting's passage of this resolution was an infringement on the sovereignty of the Cuban people. He said, "We workers and people sincerely thank the Soviet Union and China for their assistance. We will respond to the extraordinary aggression of U.S. imperialism by further strengthening various relations with these countries. In the struggle against the common enemy of mankind, U.S. imperialism, we need the assistance of the people of all countries in the world."

Alvarez said, "As the Chinese people say, U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger." He expressed his belief that the Cuban people will defeat U.S. aggression in Cuba, just as the Chinese and Korean people defeated U.S. imperialism in Korea.

Alvarez spoke of his impressions of his recent visits to the Soviet Union, China, and Czechoslovakia, and the support of the people of these countries for the Cuban revolution.

When talking about his impressions of visiting China, he said, "Under the leadership of their great leader Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are carrying out tremendous social, economic, political, and cultural transformations, and are victoriously building socialism. These great achievements are due to the lofty revolutionary spirit of the entire Chinese people." He also said that the Chinese people "are building socialism at an accelerated pace based on the characteristics of their own country, which is what they call the Great Leap Forward."

Alvarez said that in China, "the development of people's communes is of particular significance because this organizational form can enable them to move more quickly towards socialist construction." He emphasized that "the great victory of the Chinese people inspires all peoples of colonies and dependencies."

Alvarez said, "Everywhere we visited, the workers expressed their firm and enthusiastic support for their national governments and their sympathy for the Cuban revolution. They see our victory as their own victory, and our failure as their own failure."

Alvarez spoke about the obligations undertaken by the Cuban Workers' Union delegation led by him and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in their joint statement to support each other in the struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism. He condemned U.S. imperialism for occupying China's territory of Taiwan and using it as a base for launching attacks on the Chinese mainland. Alvarez also spoke about Chairman Mao Zedong's meeting with the Cuban Workers' Union delegation. He said that Chairman Mao Zedong clearly and unequivocally repeatedly explained to us that the Chinese people firmly support the Cuban people's struggle to defend national independence and oppose any imperialist attempt at aggression. He said, "The great leader of the Chinese people impressed us deeply because of his simplicity, his wisdom, and his familiar and thorough understanding of the Cuban situation and the international situation." Alvarez concluded by saying that the Cuban people's slogans of "Defend the motherland to the death," "We will win," and "Cuba yes, Yankees no" are supported by the people of all socialist countries and the oppressed peoples of the world.

    古巴工人联合会对外关系书记阿耳瓦雷斯说
    古巴将像中朝一样击败美国侵略
    中国人民的胜利鼓舞着一切殖民地附属国人民
    新华社哈瓦那31日电　古巴工人联合会对外关系书记阿耳瓦雷斯·德拉坎帕今天在这里举行的记者招待会上，猛烈谴责美国强使美洲国家组织成员国外长会议通过反对古巴的决议。
    阿耳瓦雷斯驳斥了决议中捏造的所谓西半球面临“来自大陆以外的威胁”以及苏联和中国“企图干涉拉丁美洲”的谰言。他指出，圣约瑟外长会议通过这项决议，是对古巴人民的主权的侵犯。他说，“我们劳动者和人民衷心感谢苏联和中国的援助。我们将以更加密切同这些国家的各种关系来回答美帝国主义的异乎寻常的侵略。在反对人类的共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，我们需要全世界各国人民的援助。”
    阿耳瓦雷斯说，“正如中国人民所说的那样，美帝国主义是一只纸老虎”。他表示相信，古巴人民将像中朝两国人民在朝鲜击败美帝国主义一样，在古巴击败美国的侵略。
    阿耳瓦雷斯谈到他最近访问苏联、中国和捷克斯洛伐克的印象以及这些国家的人民对古巴革命的支持。
    他在谈到访问中国的印象时说，
  “中国人民在他们伟大的领袖毛泽东的领导下，正在进行巨大的社会、经济、政治和文化改造，胜利地建设着社会主义。这些伟大的成就是由于全体中国人民具有崇高的革命精神而取得的。”他还说，中国人民“根据他们自己国家的特点以加速的步伐建设着社会主义，这就是他们所说的大跃进。”
    阿耳瓦雷斯说，在中国，“人民公社的发展具有特殊的意义，因为这种组织形式可以使他们更加迅速地向社会主义建设前进。”他强调说，“中国人民的巨大胜利鼓舞着一切殖民地和附属国人民。”
    阿耳瓦雷斯说，“在我们访问的一切地方，劳动者都表示了他们对自己国家政府的坚决和热情的支持以及他们对古巴革命的同情。他们把我们的胜利看成他们自己的胜利，把我们的失败看成他们自己的失败。”
    阿耳瓦雷斯谈到由他率领的古巴工人联合会代表团和中华全国总工会在它们签署的联合声明中承担的两国工会组织在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中互相支援的义务。他谴责美帝国主义占领中国的领土台湾，把它当作对中国大陆发动进攻的基地。阿耳瓦雷斯还谈到毛泽东主席同古巴工人联合会代表团的会见。他说，毛泽东主席明确而清楚地对我们反复说明，中国人民坚决支持古巴人民保卫民族独立和反对任何帝国主义侵略企图的斗争。他说，“中国人民的伟大领袖由于他的纯朴、他的智慧和他对古巴局势和国际局势的熟悉和透彻的了解，使我们产生了深刻的印象。”阿耳瓦雷斯最后说，古巴人民“誓死保卫祖国”、“我们必胜”和“要古巴，不要美国佬”的口号得到社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界被压迫各国人民的支持。
