    National Red Banner Converter – Qingdao Bicycle Factory's Small Converter
    Achieves New Successes in High Quality and High Yield
    Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao Electric Dispatch The entire staff of the national red banner converter—the Qingdao Bicycle Factory's 0.5-ton small converter—took the lead in the production increase and economy campaign, striving for high-quality and high-yield steel production, and achieved new results in September. According to statistics from September 1st to 7th, the average daily steel output reached 38.97 tons, the qualification rate was 96.73%, the coke consumption per ton of steel decreased to 384 kilograms, and the pig iron consumption decreased to 977 kilograms. This achievement fully met the red flag furnace indicators put forward by the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and basically realized the guarantee indicators they recently proposed to all steelmaking units in the province. After issuing a friendly competition proposal to steelmaking units across the province, the workers of this converter immediately launched a "one-dragon" cooperation competition between shifts, groups, and work processes, continuing to implement the movement of "zero waste steel in a hundred furnaces" and "saving one minute" in each process. In the competition, every work process raced against time, working together for steel. Leading cadres insisted on going to the front line of production to work alongside workers, breaking through weak links in production together. The workers in the steelmaking workshop took various measures to strengthen desulfurization. They adopted the method of drying during the day and baking at night to process coke with high humidity, ensuring that the iron smelting furnace eats dry materials. At the same time, they strictly implemented operating procedures, implemented strict checks at each level for desulfurization in the iron smelting furnace, with each work process responsible for its own part; in addition, they strictly controlled the particle size of coke and iron, ensuring uniform three materials, and accurate weighing, thereby subduing the high sulfur and seizing high quality and high yield.
    Inspired by the slogan "Do a Good Deed to Support Steelmaking," workers in other workshops of the factory tried every means to support the converter workers in producing more and better steel. The mechanical processing workshop produced a large number of spare parts for the steelmaking workshop.
    At present, the workers of this converter are advancing victoriously, determined to make even more outstanding achievements and offer a gift to National Day.

    全国红旗转炉——青岛自行车厂小转炉
    再创优质高产新成就
    新华社青岛电　全国红旗转炉——青岛自行车厂零点五吨小转炉全体职工，在增产节约运动中一马当先，力争钢铁生产优质高产，9月份又有了新的成绩。据9月1日到7日的统计，钢的平均日产量达到三十八点九七吨，合格率为96.73％，每炼一吨钢所消耗的焦炭下降到三百八十四公斤，消耗的生铁下降到九百七十七公斤。这一成就全面达到了中共山东省委提出的红旗炉的指标，也基本实现了他们最近向全省炼钢单位倡议的保证指标。这个转炉的职工在向全省炼钢单位发出友谊竞赛倡议之后，立即开展了班与班、组与组、工序与工序之间的“一条龙”协作赛，继续贯彻百炉无废钢和每道工序“节约一分钟”的运动。在竞赛运动中，各个工序分秒必争，同心协力为钢而战。领导干部坚持深入生产第一线跟班劳动，和职工一起突破生产薄弱环节。炼钢车间的职工采取各种措施加强脱硫。他们采取白天晒夜间烘的办法，处理湿度较大的焦炭，保证化铁炉吃干料。同时，严格地执行了操作工艺规程，对化铁炉脱硫实行关关设卡、各道工序分工负责的办法；此外还严格控制了焦、铁粒度，保证三料均匀，做到过磅准确，从而，降服了高硫，夺取了优质高产。
    这个厂其他车间的工人，在“为支援炼钢做一件好事”的口号鼓舞下，千方百计地支援转炉职工多炼钢炼好钢。机械加工车间为炼钢车间生产了大量的备品配件。
    目前，这个转炉的职工，正在乘胜前进，决心作出更优异的成绩，向国庆节献礼。
