    Chenmen Commune Carefully Cultivates Citrus
    (Our report) The Chenmen Commune in Minhou County, Fujian Province, is seizing the time during the fruit enlargement period for citrus fruits. It is rationally arranging labor and engaging in intensive orchard management. Currently, the citrus trees are laden with fruit. The Chenmen Commune has 1,717 mu of citrus orchards. This year, while focusing on grain production, the Commune Party Committee is also vigorously promoting citrus production. It is using methods that scientifically summarize the masses' experience in achieving high yields from fruit trees to improve the management level of large-scale orchards. Based on the experience of Chen Zhaoquan, a 70-plus-year-old commune member who has studied and treated Agrilus sinuatus for decades, and the high-yield experience of Yang Zhaodong, a fruit tree labor model who irrigates his orchard every half month during droughts, the Commune Party Committee immediately launched two campaigns to prevent and control Agrilus sinuatus throughout the commune. The infestation rate of Agrilus sinuatus has been reduced from 20% in the past to 0.5%. In orchard irrigation, all brigades have extensively dug channels and installed water pumps in the citrus orchards, enabling more than 1,000 mu of citrus orchards to be irrigated three or four times, promoting fuller fruit development.
    After adopting measures such as pest control, irrigation, soil cultivation, and fertilization, the fruit trees throughout the commune are currently growing very vigorously, with more fruit setting than last year and a significant reduction in fruit drop. To ensure a bumper harvest of fruit trees, the commune has recently arranged to apply a fast-acting fertilizer again before the White Dew solar term.

    城门公社精心培育柑桔
    本报讯　福建闽侯县城门公社抓紧柑桔壮果时期，合理安排劳力，大闹果园管理，目前柑桔结实累累。城门公社共有柑桔一千七百十七亩，公社党委今年在搞好粮食生产的同时，大抓柑桔生产，并采用科学总结群众果树丰产经验的办法，来提高大面积果园的管理水平。这个公社党委根据七十多岁社员陈兆泉几十年来研究除治吉丁虫的经验和果树劳动模范杨兆栋的旱天果园半月一灌溉的丰产经验，立即在全社范围内开展了两次防治吉丁虫运动，吉丁虫虫害率由过去的20％降低到0.5％。在果园灌溉中，各个大队在柑桔园里大挖渠道，装置抽水机，使一千多亩柑桔园都灌了三、四次水，促进了果实饱满。
    采取治虫、灌溉、培土、施肥等措施后，目前全社果树生长十分旺盛，结果比去年多，落果也大大减少。为保证果树丰收，公社最近又安排在白露前再追施一次速效肥。
