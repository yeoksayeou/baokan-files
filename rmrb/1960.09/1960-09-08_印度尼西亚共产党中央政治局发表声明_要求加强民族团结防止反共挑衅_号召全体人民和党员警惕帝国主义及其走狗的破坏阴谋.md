Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 5th: The Indonesian "People's Daily" today published a statement from the Central Political Bureau of the Indonesian Communist Party entitled "Strengthen National Unity, Prevent Provocations."

The statement first quoted President Sukarno's words in his August 17th speech: Muslims, Nationalists, and Communists must cooperate. The statement then said that this cooperation, which has become the content and spirit of the Political Manifesto, is very clearly and definitely stipulated. Therefore, anyone taking any form of anti-communist measures is clearly violating the national policy and program of the Republic of Indonesia.

The statement said that, certainly, imperialists and their lackeys in Indonesia are desperately opposed to the resolute implementation of this political cooperation, which has been embodied in the form of unity among Muslims, Nationalists, and Communists. This is precisely because they are very clear that if Muslims, Nationalists, and Communists are united as one, then no force in the world can prevent the realization of the Political Manifesto and the 1945 Constitution, etc.

Referring to the Japanese government's decision to postpone the visit of the Dutch aircraft carrier "Karel Doorman" to Japan, the statement said that this clearly proves the unity of the people, especially the unity of the three political groups - Nationalists, Muslims and Communists. This unity was also reflected in the unanimous resolution passed by the Cooperation Parliament to protest the Japanese government's agreement to the visit of the "Karel Doorman."

The statement pointed out that imperialists and their lackeys will certainly do everything possible to create difficulties and undermine the implementation of the Political Manifesto. They are focusing their efforts on weakening the basic forces that support and implement the Political Manifesto. The statement said that in this regard, the Indonesian Communist Party has become the main target. If they can successfully suppress or weaken the strength of the Indonesian Communist Party, it will be easier to weaken the political power of the Nationalist Party and revolutionary Muslims. If they can render the Indonesian Communist Party powerless, it means they can eliminate a basic force that supports and implements the Political Manifesto. As a result, all forces that support and implement the Political Manifesto will be weakened or become powerless.

The statement concluded by saying that under these circumstances, the Indonesian Communist Party calls on all people, especially all Communist Party members and sympathizers, to be doubly vigilant. Some recent events are attempts "that we must defeat." Faced with these attempts, the Central Political Bureau of the Indonesian Communist Party calls on all party members and party sympathizers to continue to loyally serve the interests of the people and the motherland, first and foremost to resolutely prevent all provocations against the Indonesian Communist Party.

    印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局发表声明
    要求加强民族团结防止反共挑衅
    号召全体人民和党员警惕帝国主义及其走狗的破坏阴谋
    新华社雅加达5日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”今天刊载了印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局的题为“加强民族团结，防止挑衅”的声明。
    声明首先援引了苏加诺总统在8月17日讲话中所说的话：穆斯林、国民党人和共产党人必须合作。声明接着说，成为政治宣言的内容和精神的这种合作是非常明确和肯定地规定了的，因此任何人采取任何形式的反共措施显然都是违背印度尼西亚共和国的国家方针和纲领的。
    声明说，肯定地，帝国主义者及其在印度尼西亚的走狗拼命反对坚决实现这种政治上的合作，这种合作已经以穆斯林、国民党人和共产党人的团结的形式体现出来。这正是因为他们十分清楚，如果穆斯林、国民党人和共产党人团结得像一个人，那么世界上就没有什么力量可以阻止政治宣言和1945年宪法等的实现。
    在谈到日本政府决定推迟荷兰“卡雷耳·杜尔曼号”航空母舰到日本访问一事时，声明说，这非常清楚地证明了人民的团结，尤其是三个政治集团——国民党人、穆斯林和共产党人——的团结。这种团结在合作国会为抗议日本政府同意“卡雷耳·杜尔曼号”航空母舰访问日本所一致通过的决议中也得到了反映。
    声明指出，帝国主义者和他们的走狗肯定会千方百计地来制造困难和破坏政治宣言的实现。他们集中力量来削弱支持和实现政治宣言的基本力量。声明说，在这方面，印度尼西亚共产党成了主要目标。如果他们能够成功地镇压或削弱印度尼西亚共产党的力量，那就更容易削弱国民党和革命的穆斯林的政治力量。如果他们能够使印度尼西亚共产党变得无能为力，这意味着，他们能够排除一个支持和实现政治宣言的基本力量。结果，所有支持和实现政治宣言的力量都将被削弱或成为无能为力。
    声明最后说，在这种情况下，印度尼西亚共产党呼吁全体人民，特别是全体共产党员和党的同情者，要加倍警惕。最近发生的一些事件“是我们必须加以击败”的企图。面对着这些企图，印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局呼吁全体党员和党的同情者，继续忠诚地为人民和祖国的利益服务，首先是要坚决地防免对印度尼西亚共产党进行的一切挑衅。
