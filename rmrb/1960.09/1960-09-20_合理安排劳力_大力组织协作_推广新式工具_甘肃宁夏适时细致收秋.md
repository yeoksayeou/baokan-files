Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou Telegram: In most areas of central and southern Gansu, the autumn crops are already ripe, and the broad masses of commune members are seizing every minute to harvest them meticulously and joyfully.

The autumn fields being harvested on a large scale in various places include oats, naked oats, buckwheat, potatoes, flax, and hemp. The harvesting of corn, millet, and beans has also begun successively. Based on the characteristics of this year's autumn harvest and autumn planting areas being universally larger than in previous years, and the concentrated use of labor, all localities, in the spirit of "looking at the next step while taking the current step, striving to be proactive in every step," are prioritizing the autumn fields block by block and arranging labor, draft animals, and farm tools early and rationally, so as to harvest each ripe area, harvest and cultivate simultaneously, and harvest while planting, forming a continuous cycle of three sets. In the autumn harvest, Yangpo Production Team of Lü’er People's Commune in Tianshui City, based on the situation of mountainous terrain and long distances, which takes a lot of time to go to and from the fields, promptly researched and promoted the method of incidental transportation, that is, each person brings a load of manure (for autumn planting) when going to the fields and transports autumn grain when returning, which greatly reduces the labor force specifically responsible for transportation. The amount of fertilizer transported to the fields by just over a hundred people in three days would take twenty full laborers a whole day to transport specially. Counties such as Hui and Cheng have also changed the previous habit of waiting for early-maturing crops to wait for late-maturing crops, and harvesting each block at once, based on the characteristic of multiple intercropping varieties in this year's autumn fields, and adopted the method of harvesting whatever variety ripens first, which solves the contradiction in the harvesting time between the main field and the subsidiary field.

Recently, there has been a lot of rain in the southern region. In order to prevent lodging and mildew of oats and naked oats with soft stalks, all communes have carried out large-scale cooperation based on the principle of equal value exchange, mutual assistance, and mutual benefit, organizing late-maturing areas to help early-maturing areas, and plain areas to help mountainous areas to quickly harvest the crops. After the communes in Qingshui County carried out cooperation, the harvesting progress was greatly accelerated. By September 10, the county had harvested more than 119,000 mu of autumn fields, which is the fastest autumn harvest progress in the Tianshui Prefecture.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan Telegram: From the Yellow River Plain under the Helan Mountains to the Liupan Mountains in the south, a tense large-scale autumn crop harvesting work is in full swing in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

This year, the autonomous region's autumn crops have a large harvesting area, a long front, and different ripening times. Based on these characteristics, party committees at all levels have organized cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians to go deep into the fields before the autumn harvest to conduct baseline surveys and prioritization. Based on the growth of crops, they have rationally arranged labor and animal power according to several tasks such as harvesting, managing, and planting, so as to ensure that plans are implemented, and measures are assigned to people and fields, and to harvest each ripe area. Enhe Commune in Zhongwei County concentrated its main labor force, animal power, and vehicles to focus on the autumn harvest, and organized seven teams according to the strength of commune members' labor, technical expertise, and the distance of the land, namely, seed selection, harvesting, bundling, transporting, picking, and threshing, to carry out a concentrated assault, ensuring the smooth progress of the autumn harvest.

In order to harvest quickly, harvest more, and harvest meticulously, counties, cities, and communes have established autumn harvest headquarters and command groups at each level. Many counties and cities have greatly strengthened the leadership of the autumn harvest by combining the promotion of the "two-five system" and the "three-three-four system" of Yongning County (30% remain in the agency for office work, 30% go deep into the front line, and 40% are assigned to management areas and production teams to settle down). Various localities have also transferred manpower from government agencies, schools, factories, and mines to enrich the autumn harvest front. At the same time, they are also vigorously organizing the promotion and use of advanced harvesting tools. Yanchi County produced more than 100 potato harvesting plows in advance, and the county farm tool factory also sent people to teach techniques with the plows. Zhongwei County also installed ball bearings on many stone rollers, ensuring that the speed of harvesting and threshing is comprehensively accelerated.

    合理安排劳力　大力组织协作　推广新式工具
    甘肃宁夏适时细致收秋
    新华社兰州电　甘肃中部和南部大部分地区的秋收作物已经黄熟，广大社员正在分秒必争地、喜气洋洋地精心收割。
    各地大面积收割的秋田是：燕麦、莜麦、荞麦、马铃薯、胡麻、大麻等，玉米、糜谷、豆类作物也陆续开始收割。根据今年秋收、秋播面积普遍比往年扩大，劳力使用集中的特点，各地本着“上步看下步，步步争主动”的精神，对秋田逐块进行排队，及早合理安排劳力、耕畜、农具，做到黄一块，收一块，随黄随收，随收随耕，边收边种，三套连环。天水市吕二人民公社阳坡生产队在收秋中，根据山地路远，来回上地花费时间多的情况，及时研究推广了捎脚运输的办法，即：每人上地捎一回粪（秋播用），回来运送秋粮，大大减少了专门担负运输的劳动力，只一百余人三天中捎带运到地里的粪肥，就要二十个全劳力专门运送一天。徽成等县还根据今年秋田套种间作品种多的特点，改变了以往早熟等晚熟，块块一次收的习惯，采取了什么品种先熟就先收什么的办法，解决了主田与副田收割时间上的矛盾。
    最近南部地区多雨，为了防止秸秆软的燕麦、莜麦发生倒伏和霉烂现象，各公社都根据等价交换互助互利的原则，开展大协作，组织晚熟地区帮助早熟地区、川区帮助山区迅速抢收。清水县各公社开展协作后，收割进度大大加快，至9月10日全县已收割秋田十一万九千多亩，是天水专区秋收进度最快的一个县。
    新华社银川电　宁夏回族自治区从贺兰山下的黄河平原到南部的六盘山区，一个紧张的大秋作物收获工作正在全面展开。
    今年，自治区大秋作物的收割面积大、战线长、成熟时间不一。根据这些特点，各级党委在秋收前都纷纷组织干部、老农、技术员深入田间，进行摸底排队，根据农作物生长情况，按收、管、种等几路农活，合理安排了劳力、畜力，做到计划落实，措施到人、到田，熟一块割一块。中卫县恩和公社集中了主要劳力、畜力和车辆主攻秋收，并按社员劳力强弱、技术特长、土地远近分别组织选种、收割、抱捆、拉运、拣拾、碾打等七路队伍，分头突击，保证了秋收工作顺利进展。
    为了快收、多收、细收，各县、市、公社都逐级成立秋收指挥部、指挥组。许多县、市结合推广“二五制”和永宁县的“三三四制”（30％留机关办公、30％深入第一线、40％下放到管理区和生产队安家落户），大大加强了秋收的领导力量。各地还从机关、学校、厂矿中抽调人力充实秋收战线。同时，还大力组织推广使用先进收割工具。盐池县提早生产了一百多部洋芋收获犁，县农具厂并派人随犁传授技术。中卫县还给很多石碾装上了滚珠轴承，保证了收割、打碾全面加快速度。
