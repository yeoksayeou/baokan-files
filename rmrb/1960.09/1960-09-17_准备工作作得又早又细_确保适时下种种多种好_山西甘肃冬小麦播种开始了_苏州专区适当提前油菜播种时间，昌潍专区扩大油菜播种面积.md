Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th -- Under the slogan of "Seizing the Season, Ensuring Timeliness, Planting More Wheat, Planting Good Wheat," wheat-producing areas in Shanxi are starting to sow winter wheat from south to north. Jinan area, where the season comes earlier, began sowing in late August. Some communes have already finished planting. The wheat sowing work in various counties of Jinzhong District also started in full swing in early September. According to inspections in counties such as Pu, Wuxiang, Qin, and Wenshui: the sown wheat fields have generally been deep-plowed twice, to a depth of six to eight inches, with more than 60 dan of base fertilizer applied per mu. The seeds have been carefully selected and disinfected, basically achieving rational close planting.

This year, various places are creating conditions for achieving more production and higher yields in wheat planting preparations. All areas are both tapping the potential of the land to expand planting and focusing on high-yield fields. Jinan Prefecture summarized the experience of increasing production in the large-scale construction of high-yield plots during this year's summer harvest, and decided to expand the area of wheat high-yield plots to 40% of the total wheat field area during this autumn planting. Most high-yield plots have now completed the tasks of demarcation, land preparation, and field surface construction, and are being sown. At the same time, people's communes have also organized temporary professional teams to carry out large-scale land preparation, fertilization, and soil improvement on general fields and low-yield fields. Before sowing, various places also made technical preparations to ensure good planting. Lüliang County trained 779 technicians and organized 1,200 skilled seed drill operators before wheat planting, so as to be responsible for the plot, for sowing, for emergence, and for full seedlings. In Pu County, each commune has established a responsibility system for each process of wheat planting, implementing chain responsibility and mutual acceptance, so that sowing is both fast and good.

Active support for wheat planting from all walks of life is another characteristic of this year's wheat planting. In Wuxiang County, more than 17,000 laborers from organs, schools, factories, and mines went to the countryside to support wheat planting. The county-run and commune-run industrial and commercial systems of this county also helped commune members modify and repair more than 2,000 pieces of sowing tools.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch -- Gansu Province has started sowing winter wheat. Pingliang and Tianshui Prefectures, the main winter wheat producing areas in the province, have already sown more than 260,000 mu of winter wheat.

In order to speed up the sowing progress and improve the sowing quality, autumn sowing headquarters have been established at all levels, from the county party committee to the production team. People's communes and production teams have also organized specialized teams for land preparation and moisture conservation, fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production, and seed drilling, according to the strength of the labor force and the level of technology. In Zhenyuan County, the seven communes of Kaibian, Chengguan, and Maqu concentrated 70% of their labor force to participate in various professional teams, and cooperated to sow more than 35,000 mu of wheat in a few days, and the sowing quality was very good. Xin'cheng, Sancha, Mengba and other communes also intercropped rapeseed and turnip in 30% of the sown wheat fields.

This year, Gansu Province's autumn sowing work is being grasped earlier, more meticulously, and better than in previous years. All the winter wheat stubble land in the province has basically undergone one to three times of summer plowing, and many areas have also combined plowing and soil disinfection. Various places have prepared more than 80% of the required fertilizer for autumn sowing. In order to further improve the sowing quality of mountainous and plain areas, remote and near areas, stubble fields and returning fields, all the prefectural and county party committees have formed inspection teams to go deep into the work groups, fields, livestock pens, fertilizer yards, and warehouses to check the quantity and quality of fertilizer, seed selection and mixing, the number of summer plowing, and the preparation of agricultural tools, piece by piece, item by item. When problems are discovered, they are studied on the spot and solved on the spot, striving to carry out the winter wheat sowing work in a solid manner.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th -- Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, has started sowing rapeseed.

The plan for planting rapeseed in Suzhou Prefecture this autumn has been gradually implemented to small teams and fields through discussions at all levels in late August and early September.

When discussing the plan and starting sowing, leading cadres of party committees at all levels first effectively solved the problem of insufficient seedling field area through in-depth inspections, so as to ensure the completion of the rapeseed planting plan. Chen Shunzhong, the first secretary of the Ouchu Commune Party Committee in Changshu County, found in his inspection of the Xinku Brigade that although the rapeseed planting plan had been implemented to the fields, the seedling fields had not yet been determined. The rapeseed seedling fields in the Sufeng, Donghu, and Dongyi Brigades were also insufficient, and some teams did not have enough seeds. The Commune Party Committee immediately mobilized cadres and the masses to carry out a large discussion on how to plant enough and plant good rapeseed, so that everyone realized that sufficient and good seedling cultivation is the primary key to increasing rapeseed production. Then, the masses were mobilized to check the planned planting area of rapeseed, check the implementation of seedling fields and the quantity and quality of seeds, schedule the planting time, and adopt intercropping and the use of ten-side gaps to solve the problem of insufficient seedling fields. Hupu Commune in Changshu County used field ridges, canal sides, pond sides, river sides, early cotton fields, early soybean fields, sorghum fields, and late summer vegetable fields to cultivate seedlings, reaching the required seedling land area.

This year, rapeseed sowing in the Suzhou area has also broken the old habit of "sowing when the Cold Dew arrives" and has been appropriately advanced to before the autumnal equinox. The Rocket Brigade of Hengshan Commune in Wujiang County, which has achieved increased rapeseed production for two consecutive years, started land preparation and sowing on September 2, and has now completed all sowing.

In rapeseed sowing, cadres at all levels have gone deep into the front line of sowing, focusing on sowing quality, so the sowing quality has been generally improved this year. The deputy secretary of the Xincheng Brigade branch of Lujia Commune in Kunshan County personally took charge, organized a professional team to carefully sow rapeseed seedlings. Each seedling field was deeply ploughed and exposed to the sun, and 15 dan of manure per mu was applied as base fertilizer. All the seeds were high-yield "Victory Rapeseed" varieties, and they were mixed with pesticides before sowing. All 64 mu of seedling land in the brigade were sown according to high standards.

Areas that have not yet been sown are seizing favorable opportunities to rush to plow and fertilize the land to prepare for sowing; areas that have been sown are strengthening rapeseed field management in accordance with the spirit of managing as soon as they are planted. The first batch of sown seedlings have seen tender buds, and the fields are full of new green.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 16th -- Changwei Prefecture, Shandong Province, has started sowing rapeseed. According to statistics from five counties (cities), Gaomi, Yidu, Changle, Zhucheng, and Weifang, more than 32,200 mu of rapeseed have been sown, of which Gaomi County, which has been sowing faster, has planted more than 20,300 mu.

In the past, this area did not grow much rapeseed. This year, it will be planted on a large scale. The party committees at all levels attach great importance to areas with rapeseed planting tasks. In order to plant rapeseed well, the Changyi County Party Committee specially convened a meeting of agricultural technicians to study rapeseed production issues. The counties and communes have made appropriate arrangements for the land for planting rapeseed. In order to improve land utilization, most counties and communes have adopted intercropping with wheat or intercropping with late autumn crops. Changle County plans to intercrop rapeseed in early wheat and late wheat fields. Weifang City has sown 4,500 mu, mainly intercropping in wheat fields and sowing on the backs of flue-cured tobacco ridges. Gaomi County intercrops on the ridges of the ridged wheat fields, intercrops in vegetable fields, and makes full use of the edges, corners, and vacant land to plant rapeseed, expanding the area for rapeseed planting. Kangzhuang Commune in this county also used cotton fields to intercrop 1,700 mu, which have now emerged and are growing very well. (Attached photo)

    准备工作作得又早又细  确保适时下种种多种好
    山西甘肃冬小麦播种开始了
    苏州专区适当提前油菜播种时间，昌潍专区扩大油菜播种面积
    新华社太原16日电　在“抢季节、保适时、多种麦、种好麦”的口号下，山西产麦区从南向北陆续开始播种冬小麦。季节较早的晋南地区，从8月下旬起便先后下种。现在一部分公社已经种完。晋中区各县的小麦播种工作，在9月初也全面展开。据蒲县、武乡、沁县、文水等县检查：已下种的麦田普遍深耕两遍，深度六寸到八寸，每亩施基肥六十多担，种籽经过精选消毒，基本上做到了合理密植。
    今年各地在种麦准备中就为实现多种多收和高产多收创造条件。各地都一手挖掘土地潜力抓扩种，一手抓丰产田。晋南专区总结了今年夏收大建丰产方的增产经验，决定在今年秋种中，把小麦丰产方的面积，扩大到占麦田总面积的40％。现在大部分丰产方已经完成了划方、整地和田面工程的建设任务，正在播种。同时，各人民公社还组织临时专业队伍，对一般田和低产田大规模的进行整地、施肥和改良土壤。在播种前，各地还为保证种好作了技术准备。吕梁县在种麦前就训练了七百七十九名技术员，组织了一千二百名摇耧能手，做到包地块、包下种、包出土、包全苗。蒲县各公社在种麦的各个工序上，都建立了责任制度，实行连环负责，相互验收，使下种既快又好。
    各行各业积极支援种麦，是今年种麦的另一特点。武乡县各机关、学校、厂矿等单位下乡支援种麦的劳力达一万七千多人。这个县的县营、社营工业和商业系统，还帮助社员改制、修配了播种工具二千多件。
    据新华社讯　甘肃省开始播种冬麦。全省冬小麦主要产区的平凉、天水两个专区已经播种冬麦二十六万多亩。
    为了加快播种进度，提高播种质量，各地从县委到生产队，都层层建立了秋播指挥部。人民公社和生产队并且根据劳动力强弱，技术高低，分别组织了整地保墒、积肥造肥和提耧播种等专业队。镇原县的开边、城关、马渠等七个公社，由于集中70％的劳力组织参加各专业队，分工协作，在几天时间内就播种麦三万五千多亩，并且播种的质量很好。新城、三岔、孟坝等公社还在已播的30％的麦地中套种了油菜和芸芥。
    今年，甘肃省秋播工作抓得比往年又早、又细、又好。全省所有播种冬麦的正茬地，基本上都进行了一至三次的伏耕，许多地区并结合耕翻作了土壤消毒工作。各地为秋播地准备了所需肥料的80％以上。为了进一步提高山区和川区、远地和近地、正茬田和回茬田的播种质量，各个地委、县委都组成了检查团深入到作业组、田头、畜圈、肥料场、仓库，边看边算，逐块、逐项检查肥料数量、质量，选种拌种、伏耕次数以及农具等的准备情况，发现问题，就地研究，当场解决，争取冬麦播种工作进行得扎扎实实。
    新华社南京16日电　江苏省苏州专区开始播种油菜。
    苏州专区今秋种植油菜的计划在8月底9月初通过层层讨论，已逐步落实到小队、到田。
    在讨论计划和着手播种时，各级党委领导干部通过深入检查，首先切实解决了苗田面积不足问题，以保证完成油菜种植计划。常熟县藕渠公社党委第一书记陈顺忠在新库大队检查发现油菜种植计划虽然落实到田，但苗田尚未确定，苏锋、东湖、东羿三个大队油菜育苗田也不足，有的队种子也不够，公社党委立即发动干部、群众，开展如何种足种好油菜的大讨论，使大家认识到育苗足、育苗好是油菜增产的首要关键。随后又发动群众查油菜计划播种面积、查育苗地落实情况和种子数量、质量，排茬口、定播种时间，以及采用套种和利用十边隙地等办法，解决了育苗地不足的问题。常熟县浒浦公社利用田埂、渠旁、塘边、河边、早棉花地、早毛豆地、高粱地、夏菜晚茬地等育秧，达到了所需秧地的面积。
    今年苏州地区油菜播种还打破了“寒露落种”的老习惯，适当提前在秋分以前播种。连续两年获得油菜增产的吴江县横扇公社火箭大队，从9月2日开始整地下种，现已全部播种结束。
    在油菜播种中，各级干部深入播种第一线，狠抓播种质量，因此今年播种质量普遍提高。昆山县绿葭公社新成大队支部副书记亲自挂帅，组织专业队精心播种油菜秧，育苗地块块经过深翻晒田，每亩施十五担大粪作基肥，种子全部采用高产的“胜利油菜”品种，播前经过筛选，下种时并用农药拌种，全大队六十四亩育苗地全部按高标准播种结束。
    目前尚未播种的地区，正抓紧有利时机，突击翻地施肥准备播种；已播种的地区，正根据一种就管的精神，加强油菜田间管理。第一批下种的菜苗已见嫩芽，田间一片新绿。
    新华社济南16日电　山东昌潍专区开始播种油菜。据高密、益都、昌邑、诸城、潍坊五个县（市）的统计，已播种油菜三万二千二百多亩，其中播种较快的高密县已种二万零三百多亩。
    过去这个地区种油菜不多，今年将大面积种植，凡是有种植油菜任务的地区，各级党委都非常重视。中共昌邑县县委为把油菜种好，专门分片召开了农业技术员会议，研究油菜生产问题。对种油菜的土地，各县、社都作了适当安排。为了提高土地利用率，大多数县、社都采用了与小麦间作或与晚秋作物套种的办法。昌乐县计划在早茬小麦和晚茬麦田里套种油菜。潍坊市已播种四千五百亩，主要是在麦田里套种和播种在黄烟垅背上。高密县在畦田化的麦田畦埂上套种，在菜田套种和充分利用地边、地角和空闲地种植油菜，扩大油菜播种面积。这个县康庄公社还利用棉田套种一千七百亩，现已出苗，生长很好。（附图片）
