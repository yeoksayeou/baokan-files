Xinhua News Agency, September 16th. (Our reporter Wang Boqing reports:) The friendly envoys of the Japanese people—the Japanese Theater Troupe—arrived in Beijing by train this afternoon and received a warm welcome from more than 3,000 literary and art workers and people from all walks of life in the capital.

The Japanese male and female artists, in high spirits, held a parade en route from the Beijing Railway Station to the New Qiao Hotel, where they would be staying. They marched in formation, holding high flags and banners, and singing in unison. Their banners read: "Smash the Japan-U.S. Military Alliance Treaty!" "Long Live the Solidarity of the Chinese and Japanese People!" "Long Live the Development of Cultural Exchange Between China and Japan!"

The Japanese artists' parade received a warm welcome from literary and art workers in the capital's drama, dance, and music circles, who lined the approximately five-Li (approximately 2.5 kilometers) route. As the Japanese artists walked by singing songs such as "Tokyo-Beijing," the welcoming crowd waved colored flags, some playing suonas and trumpets, others beating gongs and drums. Slogans rose and fell in the welcoming crowd, with shouts of "Welcome the Japanese Theater Troupe," "Celebrate the Victory of the Japanese People's Anti-U.S. Patriotic Struggle," "Oppose the Japan-U.S. Military Alliance Treaty," and shouts of "Oppose U.S. Imperialist Aggression, Defend World Peace," "Chinese and Japanese People Unite," "People of the World Unite." Subsequently, all the welcoming masses followed the Japanese artists' parade.

Wherever they went, scenes of jubilation appeared, and people coming and going on the streets also automatically gathered around, waving and applauding them. When the welcoming crowd bid farewell to the Japanese artists in front of the New Qiao Hotel, the Deputy Head of the Japanese Theater Troupe, Chida Koreya, led the entire troupe in shouting, "Long Live the Solidarity of the Chinese and Japanese People!" Then, Tian Han, Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, led the welcoming crowd in shouting, "Long Live the Solidarity of the Chinese and Japanese People!" Accompanied by warm applause, more people joined in the shouting.

At 3:00 p.m. today, the Japanese artists, led by the Head of the Troupe, Murayama Tomoyoshi, and Deputy Heads Chida Koreya, Takizawa Osamu, Yamamoto Yasue, and Sugimura Haruko, stepped off the train amidst warm applause, each receiving flowers. As soon as they met the people who came to welcome them on the platform, they were like old friends reuniting after a long separation, shaking hands, embracing, and exchanging greetings, laughter, and applause, interwoven into a moving scene. Among those who came to welcome them were Ding Xilin and Xia Yan, Vice-Presidents of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Tian Han, Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, as well as well-known figures in literary and art circles such as Ouyang Yuqian, Xu Guangping, Mei Lanfang, Lü Ji, Li Bozhao, Zhou Erfu, Chen Qitong, Ma Yanxiang, Wu Xue, Jin Shan, Ma Shaobo, Ren Hong, Shu Xiuwen, Ye Zi, and Lan Ma. Also at the station to welcome them were Japanese peace figure Kinkazu Saionji, who is in Beijing, and Yoshi da Noriharu, Permanent Director of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association, and Hasegawa Toshizo, Secretary-General.

Ding Xilin, on behalf of everyone, expressed a warm welcome to the Japanese artists at the station. He said, we firmly believe that this visit to China by the Japanese artists will play a significant role in enhancing the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and strengthening cultural exchanges between the two countries. He concluded by wishing the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people would last forever.

In his speech, Head of the Troupe, Murayama Tomoyoshi, expressed his deep gratitude for the warm welcome from the hosts. He said that during this visit to China, they would, on the one hand, introduce the lives and struggles of the Japanese people to the Chinese people, and on the other hand, see the situation of China's Great Leap Forward, and through this rare opportunity, contribute to enhancing the friendship and cooperation between the Japanese and Chinese people.

Head of the Troupe, Murayama Tomoyoshi, said that so far, the Japanese government has not established normal diplomatic relations with China. The Japanese people consider this a shameful thing. The Japanese people are fighting against the Japanese reactionaries and the U.S. imperialism standing behind them. When talking about the support of the Chinese people for the struggle of the Japanese people, Head of the Troupe, Murayama Tomoyoshi, said, we feel deeply that we are not isolated, we are fighting together with you.

The speeches by Vice-President Ding Xilin and Head of the Troupe Murayama Tomoyoshi aroused bursts of warm applause at the station.

The Japanese Theater Troupe is jointly composed of five theater groups: Tokyo Art Troupe, Mingei Theater Troupe, Haiyuza Theater Troupe, Budokai Theater Troupe, and Bungakuza Theater Troupe. The entire troupe consists of 71 people. The large-scale plays they are bringing to our audience include not only the folk tale "Evening Crane," the modern play "A Woman's Life," but also "Dead Sea," which is themed on the struggle of Japanese fishermen against U.S. military bases, and will also perform several living news plays reflecting the lives and struggles of the Japanese people.

    首都文艺工作者热烈欢迎日本话剧团
    日本艺术家由车站赴住地途中举行游行反对日美条约
    新华社16日讯　本社记者汪波清报道：日本人民的友好使者——日本话剧团，于今天下午乘火车到达北京，受到首都三千多文艺工作者和各界群众热烈的欢迎。
    日本男女艺术家们在由北京车站前往居住的新侨饭店的途中，精神抖擞地举行了游行。他们高举旗帜、标语，整队行进，齐声歌唱，他们的标语写道：“粉碎日美军事同盟条约！”“日中两国人民团结万岁！”“日中两国文化交流发展万岁！”
    日本艺术家们的游行队伍，在所经过的约五华里的路上，接受了排列在道路上的首都戏剧、舞蹈、音乐等文艺工作者们的热情欢迎。当日本艺术家们唱着“东京—北京”等歌子走过来时，欢迎的人们挥舞彩旗，有的吹起唢呐和喇叭，有的打起锣鼓；欢迎队伍中，口号声此起彼伏，这里高呼：“欢迎日本话剧团”，“庆贺日本人民反美爱国斗争的胜利”，“反对日美军事同盟条约”，那里又高呼：“反对美帝侵略、保卫世界和平”，“中、日两国人民团结起来”，“全世界人民团结起来”。随后，所有欢迎群众又尾随着日本艺术家们的游行队伍行进。
    他们走到那里，那里便出现欢腾景象，大街上来往的人们也自动汇集起来，向他们招手鼓掌。在到达新侨饭店的大楼前，尾随而来的欢迎群众向日本艺术家们告别的时候，日本话剧团副团长千田是也率领全团艺术家高呼：“日中两国人民团结万岁！”接着，中国戏剧家协会主席田汉也带领欢迎群众高呼：“中日两国人民团结万岁！”伴以热烈的掌声，更多的人随之跟着高呼起来。
    今天下午三时，日本艺术家们在团长村山知义，副团长千田是也、泷泽修、山本安英、杉村春子率领下，在一片热烈的掌声中走下火车，每一个人都接受了献花。他们在站台上和前往欢迎的人们一见面，就像老朋友久别重逢一样，又是握手，又是拥抱，问好声、欢笑声和鼓掌声，交织成一片，激动人心。欢迎的人中有中国人民对外文化协会副会长丁西林、夏衍，中国戏剧家协会主席田汉，还有文艺界著名人士欧阳予倩、许广平、梅兰芳、吕骥、李伯钊、周而复、陈其通、马彦祥、吴雪、金山、马少波、任虹、舒绣文、叶子、蓝马等。到车站欢迎的还有在北京的日本和平人士西园寺公一和日中友好协会常任理事吉田法晴、事务局长长谷川敏三等。
    丁西林在车站上代表大家向日本艺术家们表示热烈的欢迎。他说，我们深信，日本艺术家们这次访问中国，对于增进中日两国人民的友谊，加强两国文化交流，一定会起到巨大作用。他最后祝贺中日两国人民的友谊万古常青。
    村山知义团长讲话时对主人们的热情欢迎表示深为感动。他表示，他们这次访问中国，一方面将向中国人民介绍日本人民的生活和他们的斗争面貌，另一方面要看看中国大跃进的情况，通过这个难得的机会，为增进日中两国人民的友谊和合作做出贡献。
    村山知义团长说，到目前为止，日本政府还没有和中国建立正常的邦交。日本人民认为这是可耻的事情。日本人民正向日本反动势力和站在它背后的美帝国主义进行斗争。村山知义团长在讲到中国人民对日本人民斗争的支持的时候，他说，我们亲切地感到，我们不是孤立的，我们是和你们在一起进行斗争的。
    丁西林副会长和村山知义团长的讲话，在车站上激起了一阵阵热烈的掌声。
    日本话剧团是由东京艺术座、民艺剧团、俳优座、葡萄会、文学座五个话剧团体联合组成。全团人员共七十一名。他们向我国观众携带的大型话剧，不仅有民间故事“夕鹤”，现代剧“女人的一生”，还有以日本渔民反对美国军事基地斗争为主题的“死海”，同时还将演出反映日本人民生活和斗争的几个活报剧。（附图片）
