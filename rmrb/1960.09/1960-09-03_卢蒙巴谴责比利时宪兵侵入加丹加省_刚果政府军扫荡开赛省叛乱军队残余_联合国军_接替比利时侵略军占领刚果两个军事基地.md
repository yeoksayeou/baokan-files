    Xinhua News Agency, September 1st dispatch from Leopoldville: In his speech at the closing meeting of the African Foreign Ministers' Conference on August 31st, Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba condemned Belgium for sending 780 gendarmes disguised as so-called "military advisors" to the Tshombe separatist group in Katanga Province of Congo.

    Lumumba emphasized that Congolese troops must enter Katanga Province. He also expressed strong opposition to any proposal to "neutralize" the Belgian-occupied military bases of Kamina and Kitona. He said that "neutralizing" these bases under UN control was also out of the question. He pointed out that these two bases should be returned to the Congolese army.

    Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd dispatch from Elisabethville: Congolese government forces, who are suppressing the Kalonji separatist group in southwestern Kasai Province that is manipulated and supported by imperialism, are sweeping up the remaining reactionary troops of this separatist group near Bakwanga. Congolese government forces captured Bakwanga on August 27th.

    According to reports, in a final desperate struggle, this separatist group, with the support of the Tshombe separatist group in Katanga, gathered remnants hiding in the forests, commanded by Belgian officers, and launched a counterattack against the Congolese government forces in an attempt to retake Bakwanga. However, they were resolutely defeated by the heroic government forces. Even United Press International acknowledged in a dispatch that these reactionary troops were unable to confront the government forces in direct combat. According to a spokesman for the Congolese government in Leopoldville, Congolese government forces continue to control the situation in Bakwanga.

    Reports indicate that Congolese government forces heading south to suppress the Tshombe separatist group in Katanga are concentrating in Luputa, a border city in Kasai Province located twenty miles from Katanga.

    According to United Press International, in order to save the Tshombe separatist group from extinction in the face of the Congolese government forces' suppression, Belgian colonialists have handed over a large number of armored vehicles to the Tshombe group.

    According to Agence France-Presse, the traitor Tshombe attended a meeting on September 1st at the Congo's Kamina military base, which is occupied by "UN forces," to plot the establishment of a military headquarters in the Baluba-inhabited area of northern Katanga Province to resist the government forces' offensive.

    It is also reported that Congolese gendarmes have set up defenses on the highway in Kivu Province leading to Rwanda-Urundi, inspecting vehicles to prevent Belgian colonialists from invading Congo from Rwanda-Urundi.

    Xinhua News Agency, September 1st dispatch from New York: UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld announced yesterday that "UN forces" manipulated by the United States have replaced Belgian aggressor troops and occupied the Belgian military bases of Kamina and Kitona in Congo.

    Hammarskjöld said in his third report to the UN Security Council on UN activities in Congo yesterday that the UN "has assumed" "complete responsibility" for managing these two military bases. He also declared that the UN "must exercise all the authority of an administrative authority" over these two bases, and that military or technical personnel of the Republic of the Congo are not allowed to be stationed in these two military bases.

    In his report, Hammarskjöld admitted that although the withdrawal deadline has passed, there are still more than 500 Belgian paratroopers and other military personnel who have not left these two military bases.

    With the backing of the United States, Hammarskjöld has recently been active in trying to place these two important military bases under the control of the United Nations, which is manipulated by the United States. The UN representative in Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga Province, threatened on August 30th that the UN would independently control the former Belgian military bases and "neutralize" them.

    Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov and Soviet Acting Permanent Representative to the United Nations Morozov visited Hammarskjöld yesterday on this matter and expressed to him that the Soviet Union firmly opposed the arguments put forward in Hammarskjöld's report that even after the Belgian troops withdraw from Kamina and Kitona, these bases cannot be handed over to the government of the Republic of the Congo, and that no military or technical personnel of the Republic will be allowed to be stationed in these bases.

    The Soviet representatives reminded Hammarskjöld that the continued presence of Belgian troops in Congo, especially in Katanga Province, is a matter of serious concern. They also protested Hammarskjöld's attempt to retain Belgian personnel at the military bases.

    卢蒙巴谴责比利时宪兵侵入加丹加省
    刚果政府军扫荡开赛省叛乱军队残余
    “联合国军”接替比利时侵略军占领刚果两个军事基地
    据新华社1日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果总理卢蒙巴8月31日在非洲国家外长会议闭幕会上的讲话中谴责比利时派遣了七百八十名宪兵伪装成加丹加的冲伯分裂集团的所谓“军事顾问”进入刚果的加丹加省。
    卢蒙巴强调，刚果军队要进入加丹加省。他还表示强烈地反对把比利时所占领的军事基地加米纳和基托纳
  “中立化”的任何主张。他说，这些基地在联合国控制下“中立化”也是不能考虑的。他指出，这两个基地应该由刚果军队收还。
    新华社2日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：讨伐开赛省西南部受帝国主义操纵和支持的卡隆吉分裂集团的刚果政府军，正在巴克旺加附近扫荡这个分裂集团的残余反动军队。刚果政府军是在8月27日攻克巴克旺加的。
    据报道，这个分裂集团为了作最后的垂死挣扎，在加丹加冲伯分裂集团的支持下，曾纠集躲藏在森林中的残兵败将，由比利时军官指挥，向刚果政府军反扑，企图重新占领巴克旺加，但是遭到了英勇的政府军的坚决打击。连合众国际社也在一则消息中承认，在直接战斗中，这些反动军队无法同政府军对抗。据刚果政府一位发言人在利奥波德维尔宣布，刚果政府军继续控制着巴克旺加的局势。
    有消息说，南下讨伐加丹加冲伯分裂集团的刚果政府军，正在离加丹加二十英里的开赛省边境城市路普塔集中。
    据合众国际社报道，为了在刚果政府军的讨伐面前拯救冲伯分裂集团复亡的命运，比利时殖民者曾把大批装甲车交给冲伯集团。
    另据法新社报道，叛徒冲伯1日曾去“联合国军”占领的刚果加米纳军事基地参加一次会议，策划在加丹加省北部巴鲁巴人居住的地区成立军事司令部，以反抗政府军的进攻。
    另据报道，刚果宪兵在基伍省通往卢安达—乌隆迪的公路上设防，检查来往车辆，以防比利时殖民者从卢安达—乌隆迪侵入刚果。
    新华社1日讯　纽约消息：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德昨天宣布，由美国操纵的“联合国军”已经接替比利时侵略军而占领了比利时在刚果的军事基地加米纳和基托纳。
    哈马舍尔德昨天在他向联合国安全理事会提出的关于联合国在刚果的活动的第三个报告中说，联合国“已经负起”管理这两个军事基地的“完全责任”。他并且宣称，联合国对这两个基地“必须运用作为行政当局的全部权威”，不准许刚果共和国的军事人员或技术人员进驻这两个军事基地。
    哈马舍尔德在报告中承认，虽然撤退限期已过，现在还有五百多名比利时伞兵和其他军事人员没有离开这两个军事基地。
    在美国的牵线下，哈马舍尔德最近以来一直在进行活动，企图把这两个重要军事基地置于美国操纵的联合国的控制之下。联合国在加丹加省首府伊利沙伯维尔的代表在8月30日扬言，联合国将单独控制前比利时军事基地，并将使它们“中立化”。
    苏联外交部第一副部长库兹涅佐夫和苏联代理常驻联合国代表莫罗佐夫昨天就此事拜访了哈马舍尔德，并且向他表示，苏联坚决反对哈马舍尔德这一报告中提出的这样的论点，就是：即使在比利时军队从加米纳和基托纳撤出以后，这些基地还不能移交给刚果共和国政府，共和国的任何军事人员和技术人员都将不允许进驻这些基地。
    苏联代表们提醒哈马舍尔德，至今仍有比利时军队继续留在刚果，特别是加丹加省，不能不引起严重的忧虑。他们还对哈马舍尔德企图在军事基地上留用比利时人员的做法表示抗议。
