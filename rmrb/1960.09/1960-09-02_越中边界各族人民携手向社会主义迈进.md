    People of All Ethnic Groups on the Sino-Vietnamese Border Join Hands to Advance Towards Socialism
    By Zhu Wenjin, Chairman of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region, Democratic Republic of Vietnam
    On the occasion of celebrating the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnamese people cannot help but mention the eternal friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China, as well as the influence and great contributions of the Chinese revolution to the Vietnamese revolution.
    In this article, I would like to review the friendly relations between the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas of our two countries, and the impact of the Chinese revolution, especially during the upsurge of the socialist revolution, on the people in the border areas of Cao Bang, Lang Son, and Ha Giang provinces of Vietnam.
    First of all, we know that there is a long-standing brotherly friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China. This relationship not only has its historical roots and is deeply engraved in the hearts of the people of our two countries, but it is also built on the solid foundation of Marxism-Leninism and the spirit of proletarian internationalism. Our two countries, Vietnam and China, are as closely related as lips and teeth, and the people of the two countries are as close as brothers who share joys and sorrows.
    During the period of national and democratic revolution, the peoples of the two countries sympathized with and supported each other. When marching towards the road of socialism, our two countries are united in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. In order to promote the upsurge of socialist construction in both countries, we always support and assist each other, and jointly devote ourselves to developing cooperation between the two countries.
    Many of the same ethnic groups, such as the Zhuang, Miao, and Yao, live in the border areas of our two countries. The friendship between the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas of the two countries is part of the friendship between the peoples of the two countries. But it also has the unique characteristics of the border area.
    Throughout the entire period of underground activities and the War of Resistance, the Sino-Vietnamese border area was a base for the armed activities of the people of the two countries. When one side had difficulties, it relied on the help of the other. After the liberation of mainland China in October 1949, especially after the great victories of the Cao-Bac-Lang and Lao Cai campaigns in Vietnam at the end of 1950, the border gates were opened and the relationship between the Sino-Vietnamese border became closer. The people of all ethnic groups in the border areas actively helped each other, especially in eliminating the US-Chiang Kai-shek spies and bandits hiding in the border areas, which made important contributions to ensuring peace and tranquility in the border areas, and at the same time provided strong support for the just war of the Vietnamese people. The people of all ethnic groups in the Vietnamese side of the Sino-Vietnamese border will never forget the extremely enthusiastic assistance given to us by the people of all ethnic groups in China during the national liberation war. This assistance was not only spiritual and material, but sometimes forged with blood.
    The US-French aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries were very clear about the feelings of mutual protection and trust among the people of all ethnic groups in our border areas. Therefore, they tried more than once to undermine this relationship. They even used barbaric means to persecute patriotic fighters and good residents in an attempt to sever this relationship. But the enemy not only failed to destroy this relationship, but instead aroused even greater resentment among the people of all ethnic groups, and further prompted them to use various methods to deal with the enemy's conspiracies in order to maintain close relations with each other forever. The long resistance war of the Vietnamese people ended in victory, peace was restored, and North Vietnam was completely liberated, further strengthening the relationship between the peoples of Vietnam and China, including the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas.
    After completing the national and democratic revolution, China entered the socialist revolution, and is currently in a period of leaping progress where "one day equals twenty years". This is a great encouragement and a brilliant example for the Vietnamese people, and also provides rich and valuable experience for the socialist revolution in North Vietnam.
    During the upsurge of the socialist revolution of the Chinese people, the people of all ethnic groups in the Sino-Vietnamese border area continuously supported each other, visited each other, and exchanged experiences, thereby further cementing their brotherly friendship and unity.
    The socialist revolution in North Vietnam is steadily advancing. Under the special care and guidance of the Vietnam Workers' Party, and with the good influence and active assistance of the socialist revolution of the brotherly neighbor, the people in the border areas of Vietnam have more deeply realized the superiority of collective production, thereby shattering the fallacies spread by the US-Chiang Kai-shek spy group about collectivization and communization, and greatly promoting the faster development of the cooperativization movement in the border areas of Cao Bang, Lang Son, and Ha Giang. In 1958, there were only five cooperatives in the above three provinces. By the end of June 1960, there were already 1,652 cooperatives in the three provinces, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounted for 34.68% of the total number of peasant households in the three provinces, including 72 advanced cooperatives. It is worth noting that the counties near the border line are developing faster than other counties.
    With the development of the cooperativization movement, the people of all ethnic groups in our country in the border areas are more actively promoting production and striving to do a good job in all other aspects. The three provinces mentioned above achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest in the summer of 1959, and the lives of the people of all ethnic groups have been significantly improved.
    With the development of the cooperativization movement, the political level, class consciousness, and socialist consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas have greatly improved. The close unity between the people of all ethnic groups has been further consolidated, and revolutionary optimism and creative labor spirit have also been greatly enhanced. The people of all ethnic groups more deeply and absolutely believe in the wise leadership of the Party, the government, and President Ho Chi Minh, so they have actively implemented the various lines and policies of the Party and the government, and have well completed the tasks assigned by the country.
    It is obvious that the people of the three provinces of Cao Bang, Ha Giang, and Lang Son have taken a big step forward on the road of socialist revolution with a high sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs. This great victory is making the appearance of our border areas completely new. At present, the socialist revolution in the border provinces is developing in a good and healthy direction, and is attracting more and more people of all ethnic groups to participate actively. It is absolutely certain that the socialist transformation in the plains areas of the border areas will be basically completed by the end of this year, and the material and cultural living standards of the people of all ethnic groups will be further improved.
    Vietnam and China have a traditional unity and friendship, and the people of our two countries are moving towards a common goal—socialism. We have the wise leadership of two brotherly parties and governments headed by Chairman Mao and President Ho, the most respected leaders of the people of our two countries. The people of all ethnic groups in the Sino-Vietnamese border areas also have a glorious revolutionary tradition and the determination to fight for socialism. We firmly believe that the friendly relations between the people of all ethnic groups in the Sino-Vietnamese border area will become closer and more developed. In the past, especially since our two countries became members of the socialist family, the long-standing feelings of mutual love and unity between the people of our two countries have blossomed with countless beautiful flowers of friendship. There is no doubt that this evergreen friendship between the people of the two countries and the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas will continue to bloom with more beautiful flowers in the future.
    On the occasion of celebrating the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on such a historically significant day, we deeply appreciate the kindness of the Chinese revolution to the Vietnamese revolution, and we will spare no effort to promote the socialist revolution in North Vietnam to move forward as a solid foundation for the struggle for national reunification.
    Let the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas of our two countries and the people of the whole country advance shoulder to shoulder on the glorious road of socialism forever!

    越中边界各族人民携手向社会主义迈进
    越南民主共和国越北自治区主席　朱文晋
    在庆祝越南民主共和国成立十五周年伟大节日的时候，越南人民不能不提起越中两国人民之间的永恒友谊，以及中国革命对越南革命的影响和巨大的功绩。
    在这篇文章里，我只想回顾一下我们两国边界地区各族人民之间的友谊关系，以及中国革命在过去特别是在社会主义革命高潮中，对越南高平、谅山、河江等省边界地区人民的影响。
    首先，我们知道，越中两国人民之间有着悠久的兄弟般的友谊关系，这种关系不仅有其历史根源，并已深深地镌刻在我们两国人民的心坎里，而且它是建立在马克思列宁主义、建立在无产阶级国际主义精神的牢固基础上的。我们越中两国是唇齿相依的邻邦，两国人民是同甘苦共患难的亲兄弟。
    在民族、民主革命时期，两国人民曾经互相同情与支持。在走向社会主义道路的时候，我们两国又团结在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭里。为了推动两国社会主义建设的高潮，我们始终相互支持和援助，并共同致力于发展两国的合作。
    我们两国边界地区居住着许多相同的民族如僮族、苗族、?族……。两国边界地区各族人民之间的友谊，是构成两国人民之间的友谊的一部分。但是它又带有边界地区特有的色彩。
    在整个地下活动和抗战时期，越中边界地区是两国人民武装活动的基地，这边有困难就依靠那边的帮助。1949年10月中国大陆解放以后，尤其是在1950年底，越南高北谅战役和老河战役获得了巨大胜利以后，边界大门畅通，越中边界的关系就更加密切了。边界各族人民积极地互相帮助，特别是消灭藏匿在边界地区的美蒋特务、土匪的工作，对保证边界安宁作出了重要的贡献，同时对越南人民的正义战争也是一个有力的支持。越中边界地区越南各族人民永远不会忘记，在民族解放战争期间，中国各族人民给予我们以极其热情的援助，这种援助不仅是精神上物质上的，而且有时是用鲜血结成的。
    美法侵略者和蒋介石反动派非常清楚我们边界各族人民相互保护和信赖的感情，因此，他们曾经不止一次地想尽办法企图破坏这种关系，他们甚至采用迫害爱国战士和善良居民的野蛮手段，妄图切断这种关系。但是敌人不仅不能够破坏这种关系，反而更加激起了各族人民的愤恨，更加促使各族人民用各种办法来对付敌人的阴谋，以便永远保持着彼此密切的关系。越南人民的长期抗战胜利结束，和平得到恢复，越南北方完全得到解放，越中两国人民包括边界各族人民之间的关系得到进一步加强。
    在完成民族、民主革命以后，中国进入了社会主义革命，目前正处在“一天等于二十年”的跃进高潮时期。这对越南人民来说是一种极大的鼓舞和光辉的榜样，同时也为越南北方社会主义革命提供了丰富的宝贵经验。
    在中国人民社会主义革命高潮时，越中边界地区各族人民不断地互相支持，互相参观访问，交流经验，从而更加密切他们之间兄弟般的友谊和团结。
    越南北方的社会主义革命正在稳步前进。在越南劳动党的特别关怀和教导下，同时又得到兄弟邻邦社会主义革命的良好影响和积极的帮助，越南边界地区人民愈加深刻地认识到集体生产的优越性，从而粉碎了美蒋特务集团散布的关于合作化、公社化的种种谬论，并且大大地促进了高平、谅山、河江边界地区合作化运动更加迅速地发展。1958年上述三个省只有五个合作社，到1960年6月底，三个省已经有一千六百五十二个合作社，入社农户占三省农户总数34.68％，其中包括七十二个高级社。值得注意的是，靠近边界线的县比其他县发展的速度快一些。
    随着合作化运动的发展，边界地区的我国各族人民更加积极地推动生产，并努力做好其他各方面的工作。上述三省1959年夏收获得全面丰收，各族人民的生活得到了显著的改善。
    随着合作化运动的发展，边界地区各族人民的政治水平、阶级觉悟和社会主义觉悟程度都大大地进步了，各族人民间如胶似漆的团结更加巩固了，革命乐观主义和创造性的劳动精神也大大地提高了。各族人民更加深刻地、绝对地相信党、政府和胡志明主席的英明领导，因而他们都积极地贯彻了党和政府的各项路线、方针，并且很好地完成了国家交给的任务。
    很显然，高平、河江、谅山三省人民以高度的主人翁态度在社会主义革命道路上向前迈进了一大步。这一巨大的胜利正在使我国边界地区的面貌焕然一新。目前边界各省社会主义革命正朝着良好的健康的方向发展着，并且日益吸引着各族人民积极参加。完全可以肯定，在今年年底边界地区的平原区社会主义改造工作将基本完成，各族人民的物质文化生活水平将得到进一步提高。
    越中两国具有传统的团结友谊，我们两国人民都朝向共同的目标——社会主义前进。我们有以两国人民最敬爱的领袖毛主席、胡主席为首的两个兄弟党和政府的英明领导，我们边界地区越中各族人民又有着光荣的革命传统和为社会主义而奋斗的决心。我们深信越中边界地区各族人民的友谊关系将日益密切和发展。在过去，尤其是自从我们两国都成为社会主义大家庭的成员以后，我们两国人民悠久的互相友爱和团结的情感，已盛放了数之不尽的艳丽的友谊之花。毫无疑问，两国人民和边界地区各族人民这种万古常青的友谊今后还将盛开更加美丽的花朵。
    在庆祝越南民主共和国成立十五周年的时候，在这样有历史意义的日子里，我们更加深切地体会到中国革命对越南革命的恩情，并更加不遗余力地推进越南北方社会主义革命向前发展，作为祖国统一斗争的坚固基础。
    让我们两国边界地区各族人民和全国人民一道肩并肩地在光荣的社会主义道路上永远前进！
