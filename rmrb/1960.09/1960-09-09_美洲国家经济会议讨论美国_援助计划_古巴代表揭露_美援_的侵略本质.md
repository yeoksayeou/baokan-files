Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from Bogota: The Economic Conference of Organization of American States member countries held its first plenary session yesterday. This economic conference, which opened on the 5th in Bogota, the capital of Colombia, focuses on discussing the so-called "aid" plan proposed by the United States to Latin American countries. Coordinating with the San Jose Foreign Ministers' Conference in August, which the United States instigated to interfere in Cuba, this conference is another step taken by the United States to further control Latin American countries economically and isolate Cuba.

The fact that the United States hastily announced a plan to "aid" Latin American countries with 500 million U.S. dollars on the eve of the San Jose Foreign Ministers' Conference, and that the San Jose Conference and the Bogota Economic Conference were held only a week apart, fully exposes Washington's farce of using dollars to lure Latin American countries to follow the United States in interfering in Cuba. An article published in the British "Daily Telegraph" on August 31, when talking about the Bogota Conference, sarcastically pointed out the connection between this conference and the San Jose Foreign Ministers' Conference. It said that the United States' "flashing of the checkbook got (U.S. Secretary of State) Herter (at the San Jose Foreign Ministers' Conference) the decision the White House ordered."

Except for the Dominican Republic, the twenty member states of the Organization of American States sent delegations to participate in this conference. At yesterday's meeting, U.S. Under Secretary of State Dillon formally presented the U.S.'s so-called "aid" plan to the conference. Dillon's speech showed that the main purpose of this U.S. plan is to isolate Cuba and resist the huge impact of the Cuban revolution in Latin America. Dillon once again insinuated that Cuba was undermining so-called "basic human rights" and "personal dignity," and advocated that Latin American countries should "follow" the "path" prescribed by the United States for them in order to "achieve the material progress they hope to achieve." An article published in the "New York Herald Tribune" on September 5 admitted that the purpose of the U.S. plan was to enable Latin American countries to "resist" "revolutionary movements like the one that occurred in Cuba."

Dillon suggested establishing a "Pan American Social Development Fund organization funded by the United States but mainly managed by the Inter-American Development Bank" to implement the U.S. plan. This shows that all "aid" will be carried out under the strict control of the United States and through institutions such as the Inter-American Development Bank manipulated by the United States. At the same time, Dillon also emphasized that Latin American countries' governments must carry out "self-help" through methods such as "reforming the tax system" and "reforming credit institutions." These additional conditions are precisely to facilitate the economic plunder by the United States and destroy the national economies of the "recipient" countries.

The Cuban delegation then exposed the predatory nature of the plan proposed by Dillon, saying that the U.S. plan would "recognize the position of U.S. imperialism in Latin American investment." The head of the Cuban delegation, Minister of Economy Regino Boti, also pointed out that people should not expect the Bogota Conference to solve the problem of underdevelopment in Latin America.

The people of Bogota, where the conference was held, strongly opposed this conference held under the control of the United States. On the evening of the 5th, when Colombian President Lleras went to the Capitol to preside over the opening meeting, tens of thousands of people in Bogota held a demonstrative gathering in Bolivar Square opposite the Capitol. The demonstrators protested the holding of the meeting, demanded that the government change its policies, and called on Latin America to unite against U.S. imperialism. The demonstrators shouted in unison, "We want Cuba, not the Yankees!" "Long live the Cuban Revolution!" and strongly protested the decision of the Organization of American States San Jose Foreign Ministers' Conference to interfere in Cuba.

The mass demonstration was interfered with by the police, and many people were arrested.

Tanks, armored vehicles, and fire engines equipped with tear gas devices have been deployed in key areas of Bogota to prevent large-scale demonstrations by the people. Colombian Minister of National Defense Hernandez Pardo announced that during the American Economic Conference, the government had taken all "necessary measures" to "maintain order."

### 美洲国家经济会议讨论美国“援助计划”  古巴代表揭露“美援”的侵略本质

    美洲国家经济会议讨论美国“援助计划”
    古巴代表揭露“美援”的侵略本质
    新华社7日讯　波哥大消息：美洲国家组织成员国经济会议昨天举行了首次全体会议。这次经济会议是5日在哥伦比亚首都波哥大开幕的，其中心议题是讨论美国提出的所谓“援助”拉丁美洲国家的计划。同8月间美国策动干涉古巴而召开的圣约瑟外长会议互相配合，这次会议，是美国为在经济上进一步控制拉丁美洲国家和孤立古巴而采取的又一个步骤。
    美国在圣约瑟外长会议前夕匆匆宣布以五亿美元“援助”拉丁美洲国家的计划以及圣约瑟会议与波哥大经济会议先后相距不过一星期的事实，充分暴露了华盛顿以美元来诱骗拉丁美洲国家追随美国干涉古巴的丑剧。英国“每日电讯报”8月31日刊载的一篇文章在谈到波哥大会议时，嘲讽地指出这次会议同圣约瑟外长会议之间的联系，它说，美国的“炫耀一下支票的做法使得（美国国务卿）赫脱（在圣约瑟外长会议上）得到了一个白宫所命令的决定。”
    除了多米尼加以外，美洲国家组织的二十个成员国派遣代表团参加了这次会议。在昨天的会议上，美国副国务卿狄龙向会议正式提出了美国的所谓“援助”计划。狄龙的发言表明，美国这项计划的主要目的就在于孤立古巴和抗拒古巴革命在拉丁美洲的巨大影响。狄龙再次含沙射影地攻击古巴破坏所谓“基本人权”和“个人尊严”，并且鼓吹拉丁美洲国家应该“遵循”美国为它们规定的“途径”，来“取得他们希望得到的物质进展”。“纽约先驱论坛报”在9月5日发表的一篇文章中承认，美国的这项计划的目的就是要使拉丁美洲国家“能够抗拒”“像在古巴发生的那样的革命运动”。
    狄龙建议成立一个“由美国出钱资助但主要由泛美开发银行管理的泛美社会发展基金组织”，来执行美国的这项计划。这表明，一切“援助”都将在美国严密控制下和通过美国操纵的泛美开发银行之类的机构进行。同时，狄龙还强调拉丁美洲国家政府必须通过“改革赋税制度”、“改革信贷机构”等办法来进行“自助”。这些附加条件恰恰是为了便利美国的经济掠夺和摧毁受“援”国的民族经济。
    古巴代表团随后揭露狄龙提出的这项计划的掠夺本质说，美国的这项计划将“使美帝国主义对拉丁美洲的投资地位得到认可”。古巴代表团团长、经济部长雷希诺·博蒂还指出，人们不应该期望波哥大会议解决拉丁美洲不发达的问题。
    会议所在地波哥大的人民强烈反对美国控制下召开的这次会议。5日晚上，当哥伦比亚总统耶拉斯前往议会大厦主持开幕会议时，波哥大成千上万的人在大厦对面的博利瓦尔广场上举行了示威性的集会，示威者表示抗议这次会议的召开，要求政府改变政策，呼吁拉丁美洲团结起来反对美帝国主义。示威群众同声高呼“要古巴，不要美国佬！”“古巴革命万岁！”的口号，并且强烈抗议美洲国家组织圣约瑟外长会议作出的干涉古巴的决议。
    群众的示威集会遭到了警察的干涉，有许多人被逮捕。
    波哥大各要害地区已经布置了坦克、装甲车和配备有催泪瓦斯装置的救火车，以防备人民群众的大规模示威。哥伦比亚国防部长埃尔南德斯·帕多宣布说，在美洲经济会议举行期间，政府已采取一切“必要的措施”来“维持秩序”。
