    Red Army Bugle
    When the Red Army marched to Xundian County, Yunnan Province, they fought a battle with the Kuomintang Yunnan Army, which was obstructing the Red Army's northward march to resist Japan. Bugler Comrade Gao Jinkui was wounded in the battle. Due to frequent marching and fighting, in order to allow Gao Jinkui to recover from his injuries quickly, he was temporarily placed in Grandma Zhu's home. Grandma Zhu took care of the Red Army bugler as if he were her own son. However, the landlord found out about this and insisted on driving the wounded Red Army soldier away. Gao Jinkui and Grandma Zhu bid farewell with tears in their eyes. Gao Jinkui held Grandma Zhu's hand tightly and said, "Our troops will definitely return. Please keep this Red Army bugle. It will be useful in the future."
    After liberation, Grandma Zhu dug the bugle out of the vegetable garden, polished it brightly with stove ash, and it really came in handy, becoming the bugle for the militia.

    红军号
    红军长征到云南省寻甸时，跟阻挠红军北上抗日的国民党滇军打了一仗。司号员高金奎同志在战斗中负了伤。由于行军作战频繁，为了让高金奎快点把伤养好，暂时把他安置在朱大妈家里。朱大妈把红军司号员当做自己儿子一样来照料。可是这件事被地主知道了，地主硬要把红军伤员赶走。高金奎和朱大妈双双含泪告别，高金奎握紧着朱大妈的手说：“咱们的队伍一定会回来的，请把这只红军号收藏起来吧，日后它会有用的”。
    解放后，朱大妈把这只军号从菜园里挖了出来，用炉灰擦的亮堂堂的，并且真有了用处，它成了民兵的号角。
