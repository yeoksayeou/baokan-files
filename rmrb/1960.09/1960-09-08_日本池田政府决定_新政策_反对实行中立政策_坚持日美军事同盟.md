Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 7th: The Japanese Ikeda government formally adopted the "New Policy" announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the afternoon of September 5th as the Ikeda government's domestic and foreign policy at a cabinet meeting on the 6th.

    In terms of diplomacy, the "New Policy" expresses opposition to the implementation of a neutral policy and further submits to the United States. It states: "Japan will reject utopian neutralism and will cooperate more closely with free countries, including the United States, as a member of the free world."

    In the "New Policy," the Ikeda government, disregarding the demands of the vast majority of Japanese people to abolish the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, also announced that "Japan will maintain the U.S.-Japan joint security system and the necessary minimum self-defense forces until the United Nations further fulfills its functions in security arrangements." Regarding relations with China and the Soviet Union, the "New Policy" states: "Japan will strive to promote economic and cultural relations with communist countries such as the Soviet Union and Communist China based on the principles of non-interference in internal affairs and mutual appropriate respect for social systems." The "New Policy" also openly stated that it would "endeavor to recover its northern territories."

    The "New Policy" stipulates: "Japan will actively promote its economic diplomacy and cooperate with relevant countries" in order to expand outwards. To this end, an "Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund" will be established. The "New Policy" also stipulates that "Japan will accelerate the implementation of its immigration plan."

    As for the issue of the Japanese people's demand for the United States to return Okinawa Island to Japan, the "New Policy" states that it "will help the island's residents realize their hopes"; but also states that, for the time being, "it will strengthen cooperation with the U.S. authorities."

    Regarding domestic policy, this "New Policy" devoted more space to publicizing the establishment of a so-called "welfare state" and the establishment of "fair and honest parliamentary politics." It trumpets that it will "develop the economy," "achieve full employment," "implement a 100 billion yen tax cut," "expand social insurance," "revamp education and culture," and so on.

    日本池田政府决定“新政策”
    反对实行中立政策　坚持日美军事同盟
  据新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本池田政府6日在内阁会议上正式通过了执政党自由民主党5日下午发表的“新政策”，作为池田政府的对内对外政策。
    在外交方面，“新政策”表示反对实行中立政策，并进一步屈从美国。它说：“日本将拒绝空想的中立主义，并且将作为自由世界的一员，同包括美国在内的自由国家进行更密切的合作”。
    池田政府在“新政策”中还不顾日本广大人民废除日美军事同盟条约的要求，宣布“日本将保持日美共同安全体制和必要的最低限度的自卫力量，直到联合国在安全安排方面的职能得到进一步履行为止”。关于同中国和苏联的关系，“新政策”说：“日本将设法根据互不干涉内政和互相适当地遵重社会制度的原则，促进同苏联和共产党中国等共产党国家的经济和文化关系”。“新政策”还公然说什么要“努力收回它的北方领土”。
    “新政策”规定：“日本将积极推行它的经济外交，并同有关国家合作”以便向外扩张。为此，将设立“海外经济合作基金”。“新政策”还规定“日本将加速执行它的移民计划”。
    至于日本人民要求美国把冲绳岛归还日本问题，“新政策”说“将帮助岛上居民实现它们的希望”；但是又说：在目前，“将加强同美国当局的合作”。
    关于国内政策，这个“新政策”用了较多的篇幅宣扬要建立所谓“福利国家”，建立“公正廉洁的议会政治”。它标榜要“发展经济”，“实现充分就业”、“实行一千亿日元的减税”、“扩大社会保险”、“刷新文教”等等。
