Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 7th: Since late April this year, the Erdaohaozi People's Commune in Changchun City, based on the needs of production development and the characteristics of industrial distribution within the commune, and using the original sub-districts as a foundation, has formed three joint enterprises, mainly focused on machinery manufacturing, building materials, and light chemical industries, encompassing multiple industries. Over the past four months, under the unified leadership of the Commune Party Committee, these joint enterprises have demonstrated great advantages in promoting the production of state-owned and commune-run industries.

Within the Erdaohaozi People's Commune, there are over one hundred state-owned, locally state-owned, and commune-run factories, as well as four farms. With the development of production, the production links between large, medium, and small enterprises have been continuously strengthened, and the relationship of mutual dependence has become increasingly close. The existing external cooperative relationship between factories, characterized by "you ask, I assist," has become inadequate to meet the needs of production development. Especially since the beginning of this year, in the process of vigorously carrying out technical revolution, developing comprehensive utilization, diversified operations, and manufacturing new products, on the one hand, there has been a feeling of insufficient technical, equipment, and labor force, and some difficulties that one factory could not handle alone have been encountered; on the other hand, each factory has great potential in terms of manpower, material resources, and technical strength, but it has not been fully explored and utilized due to the decentralized management of each factory. After the establishment of the Erdaohaozi People's Commune, although inter-factory cooperation has been continuously organized, the further development of production cooperation has been limited to a certain extent because of the "separation between factories," the over-mechanical division of labor among enterprises, and the different relationships of subordination. In order to further consolidate and improve the People's Commune, the Chinese Communist Party Committee of the Erdaohaozi People's Commune, according to the decision of the Changchun Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, has piloted three joint enterprises to carry out large-scale cooperation between large, medium, and small factories in a more planned way. After the establishment of the joint enterprises, the past temporary external cooperative relationship between local state-owned factories and commune-run factories has become a regular internal division of labor and cooperation relationship within the joint enterprises. Each factory exchanges resources, learns from each other's strengths, and if one factory is in trouble, all factories help. A regional production cooperation network has been formed, which more effectively guarantees the completion and over-completion of the state production plan. According to the statistics of the machinery manufacturing and building materials joint enterprises alone, more than 170 cooperations have been carried out in more than two months, including solving more than 120 production key problems for local state-owned factories. For example, the automobile tool factory and automobile switch factory of the machinery manufacturing joint enterprise only completed more than 40% of the monthly plan by May 20th due to the lack of thin iron sheets. Because the automobile parts factory within the joint enterprise supported the two factories with some thin iron sheets, both factories over-fulfilled the May production plan ahead of schedule. The agricultural veterinary drug factory planned to increase the production of sulfuric acid, but it lacked equipment and had not been resolved for more than half a year. After the establishment of the joint enterprise, the strength of the entire enterprise was organized to solve this key problem. Equipment was quickly manufactured to help this factory, so that the daily output of sulfuric acid in this factory increased from 0.5 tons to 4 tons. The comprehensive utilization of raw materials in state-owned factories has also been further developed. For example, the plywood factory of the building materials joint enterprise, the bark, sawdust, waste veneer, and other waste materials left over from the logs used for production, have not been fully utilized due to restrictions in labor, technology, and equipment conditions in the past. After the establishment of the joint enterprise, three satellite factories were established to help this factory, and commune-run industries were organized to use the factory's scraps to produce wood wool boards, barrels, sofas, wooden beds, stools, and other 12 kinds of products, so that the comprehensive utilization rate of logs in this factory increased from 60% in the past to about 80%. The joint enterprise also combined the technical and equipment strengths of various factories to manufacture products that were difficult for one factory to manufacture alone in the past. The three mechanical factories of the machinery manufacturing joint enterprise that produce automobile and tractor parts have long wanted to produce automobiles separately, but each factory had difficulties in producing them alone; the municipal machinery factory has a strong casting ability, but the mechanical processing ability is weak and cannot produce automobile parts; the automobile parts factory and the automobile tool factory have relatively complete mechanical processing equipment, but the casting ability is very weak. The joint enterprise made unified arrangements according to the technical equipment characteristics of each factory, organized the three factories to cooperate in division of labor, and produced trucks and 25-horsepower tractors.

The joint enterprises also concentrated the scattered manpower, material resources, and financial resources in various factories for unified use according to the principles of being conducive to production and facilitating the masses, further tapping various potentials. For example, the three joint enterprises concentrated the woodworking, tiling, and other construction workers of various factories to establish three capital construction teams, which not only completed the sporadic repair tasks of various factories, but also strongly supported the construction and new construction projects of local state-owned factories.

Because the joint enterprises can organize large-scale technical cooperation and exchange experience between factories faster and more timely, they have more effectively promoted the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. For example, a leather-making machine was successfully created in the tannery more than half a year ago. Because it lacked a four-and-a-half-horsepower motor, it had not been put into production. After the establishment of the building materials joint enterprise, a motor was transferred from the asbestos factory to support the tannery, so that this innovation that had been suppressed for more than half a year was "revived." After being put into production, not only the efficiency was increased by 10%, but also the utilization rate of cowhide was doubled. In June alone, the three joint enterprises promoted 236 new technologies and experiences in various factories, which greatly improved the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the commune's industrial enterprises.

As a result of the commune-run industry directly serving state-owned factories under the unified leadership of the joint enterprises, production has also been greatly developed. The output value of various products transferred to the commune-run factories for production by the local state-owned factories of the machinery manufacturing joint enterprise alone has reached more than 24 million yuan, and 56 sets of equipment have been given to the commune-run industry according to the principle of equivalent exchange, and 128 cadres and technicians have been sent to help the commune-run industry improve its production level.

The establishment of the joint enterprises has also created conditions for better supporting agriculture. At present, this people's commune is mobilizing the strength of various factories of the joint enterprise to quickly equip the commune's four farms in order to increase vegetable production.

    互通有无取长补短　一厂有事众厂相帮
    二道河子公社组成三个联合企业，促进国营工业和社办工业发展
    新华社长春7日电　长春市二道河子人民公社从今年4月下旬开始，根据生产发展的需要，按公社内工业分布的特点，以原分社为基础，把公社范围内的地方国营工厂和社办工厂，分别组成了以机械制造业、建筑材料业、轻化工业为主的多业并存的三个联合企业。四个月来，这些联合企业在公社党委的统一领导下，在促进国营工业和社办工业的生产等方面，都显示了很大的优越性。
    二道河子人民公社范围内，共有国营、地方国营工厂和社办工厂一百多个，还有四个农场。随着生产的发展，各大、中、小企业生产上的联系日益加强，相互依存的关系日益密切，已有的那种厂与厂之间“你求我援”的外部协作关系，已经不能适应生产发展的需要。特别是今年以来，各厂在大闹技术革命、发展综合利用、多种经营和制造新产品的过程中，一方面，技术、设备力量和劳动力均感不足，遇到了一厂力所不及的一些困难；另一方面，各厂又都在人力、物力和技术力量方面有很大潜力，只是由于各厂分散经营而没有被充分挖掘出来加以利用。二道河子人民公社成立以后，虽然不断地组织厂际之间开展大协作，但是由于各企业有着“厂际之隔”，企业分工也过于机械，又有隶属关系的不同，在进一步开展生产协作上就受到一定限制。为了进一步巩固和提高人民公社，二道河子人民公社的中共党委就根据中共长春市委的决定，试办了三个联合企业，更有计划地在大、中、小工厂之间开展大协作。联合企业成立后，地方国营工厂和社办工厂之间过去那种临时性的外部协作关系，就成为联合企业内部经常性的分工合作关系，各厂互通有无、取长补短、一厂有事，众厂相帮，形成了一个地区性的生产协作网，更加有力地保证了国家生产计划的完成和超额完成。仅据机械制造和建筑材料两个联合企业的统计，两个多月来就开展了一百七十多次协作，其中为地方国营工厂解决了一百二十多项生产关键。如机械制造联合企业的汽车工具厂和汽车开关厂，5月份因缺少薄铁板，到5月20日只完成月计划的40％多，由于联合企业内的汽车配件厂支援这两厂若干薄铁板，使两厂都提前超额完成了5月份的生产计划。农兽药厂计划要增加硫酸的产量，但是缺少设备，半年多来没有解决，联合企业成立后，就组织全企业的力量来解决这个关键问题，很快帮助这个厂制造出了一套设备，使这个厂硫酸生产的日产量由零点五吨提高到四吨。国营工厂对原材料的综合利用也进一步开展起来了，如建筑材料联合企业的胶合板厂，生产用的原木所剩下的树皮、锯末、废单板等废材，过去由于劳力、技术、设备条件方面还有限制，一直没有完全利用起来。联合企业成立后，帮助这个厂办了三个卫星工厂，并组织社办工业利用这个厂的边角废料生产了木丝板、圆桶、沙发、木床、凳子等十二种产品，使这个厂的原木综合利用率由过去的60％提高到80％左右。联合企业还联合各厂的技术、设备力量，制造出了过去一厂单独制造有困难的产品。机械制造联合企业的三个生产汽车和拖拉机配件的机械工厂，长期以来都想各自生产汽车，但各厂单独生产都有困难；市机械厂有较强的铸造能力，但机械加工能力较弱，不能生产汽车零件；汽车配件厂和汽车工具厂有较完整的机械加工设备，但铸造能力都很弱。联合企业就根据各厂技术设备的特点，作了统一安排，组织三个工厂分工合作，生产出了载重汽车和二十五马力的拖拉机。
    联合企业还根据有利生产和方便群众的原则，把分散在各厂的零星的人力、物力、财力，集中起来统一使用，进一步挖掘了各种潜力。如三个联合企业集中了各厂的木工、瓦工等修建工人建立了三个基建队，不仅完成了各厂零星的修补任务，而且有力地支援了地方国营工厂的修建、新建工程。
    联合企业由于能更快、更及时地组织各厂之间的技术大协作，和交流经验，因而更加有力地促进了技术革新和技术革命运动的发展。如制革厂在半年多前就创造成功了一台制革机，因为缺少一台四马力半的电动机，一直没有投入生产，建筑材料联合企业成立后，就从石棉厂调出一台电动机支援制革厂，使这项压了半年多的革新得到了“复活”，投入生产后，不仅效率提高10％，而且牛皮利用率还提高一倍。三个联合企业仅6月份就在各厂推广了各种新技术和经验二百三十六项，使全公社工业企业的机械化半机械化程度有了很大提高。
    社办工业在联合企业统一领导下直接为国营工厂服务的结果，生产也有了很大发展。仅机械制造联合企业各地方国营工厂下放给社办工厂生产的各种产品，产值已达二千四百多万元，还以等价交换原则让给社办工业五十六台设备，并且派出一百二十八名干部、技术人员，帮助社办工业提高生产水平。
    联合企业成立后，也为更好地支援农业创造了条件。目前，这个人民公社正在调动联合企业各厂的力量，迅速装备公社的四个农场，以增加蔬菜产量。
