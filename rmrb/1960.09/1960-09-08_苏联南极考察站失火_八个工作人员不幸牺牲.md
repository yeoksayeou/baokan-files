Xinhua News Agency, 7th. TASS reported that a fire broke out at the weather observation station at the Soviet Antarctic research base, Vostok Station, on the 3rd.

    The fire occurred during a strong typhoon, with wind speeds exceeding 200 kilometers per hour. The staff of the weather observation station and other members of the expedition team who came to support them fought bravely against the fire in the midst of a fierce blizzard. Like other buildings, the observation station was covered by several meters of snow brought by the blizzards of the entire Antarctic winter, which made the fight to extinguish the fire difficult.

    Six staff members of the Soviet Fifth Antarctic Expedition, as well as a Czechoslovak scientist and a scientist from the German Democratic Republic, died in the fire.

    苏联南极考察站失火
    八个工作人员不幸牺牲
    新华社7日讯  据塔斯社报道：南极苏联科学考察基地和平村的气象观测台在3日发生火灾。
    这场火灾正发生在强台风时期，风速每小时超过二百公里。气象观测台的工作人员和前来支援的考察队其他人员在猛烈的暴风雪中奋不顾身地同大火搏斗。观测台和其他建筑物一样，被整个南极冬季时期暴风雪所带来的几米厚的雪层掩盖起来，这使扑灭火灾的斗争发生了困难。
    苏联第五南极考察队的六个工作人员以及一个捷克斯洛伐克科学工作者和一个德意志民主共和国科学家在火灾中牺牲。
