Xinhua News Agency, September 24th dispatch from Elisabethville: The people of Katanga Province in the Congo, defying the bloody suppression by imperialism and its running dog, the Tshombe clique, continue to bravely wage a patriotic armed struggle to defend independence and unity. In Manono, in the northern part of the province, the people opposing the brutal rule of the colonialists and the Tshombe clique still control some areas on the outskirts of the town. They have erected a roadblock every six hundred feet along the highway, preparing for further counterattacks by reactionary military police commanded by Belgian officers.

According to Agence France-Presse on the 23rd, fearing the people's struggle, the Belgian Consul General in Elisabethville, who was traveling to Manono, had to wait at the airport for two hours in order for the "UN forces" to escort him into the city.

Near the Kamina military base, north of Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga Province, a group of Baluba people are also concentrating, preparing to launch an offensive against the Tshombe clique.

According to a spokesman for the Tshombe clique's "Ministry of Interior," many areas in central and northern Katanga Province are still under the control of insurgents. News has it that the powerful struggle of the people has alarmed the Tshombe clique. While threatening to continue to take cruel suppression measures against the patriotic people, they hurriedly requested the "UN forces" there to protect the transportation lines and escort trucks. A UN spokesman announced on the 22nd that "UN forces" would "take over" the railway protection work between Kamina and Luena in Katanga Province.

In Leopoldville, the capital of the Congo, the struggle against the Mobutu rebel group is also developing. According to the Indian Press Trust on the 23rd, the Congolese soldiers who demonstrated in front of Mobutu's residence on the 22nd angrily rushed into the armory after Mobutu's guards fired on them. At that time, the terrified Mobutu immediately called the "UN forces" for help. The news said that the UN authorities in the Congo openly sent "UN forces" to escort Mobutu from his residence to Camp Leopold. According to the latest issue of the American "Time" magazine, "Mobutu is a frequent visitor to the US Embassy, holding lengthy talks with officials there."

According to the President of the Congolese Senate in Leopoldville on the 23rd, the speakers of the Congolese Senate and House of Representatives have again sent telegrams to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, reiterating their support for the Lumumba government and protesting the atrocities of Mobutu and others, as well as the activities of the "UN forces" in the Congo.

In his telegram, Okito condemned Mobutu's atrocities of closing the parliament and persecuting parliamentarians. He said that Mobutu and others had been obstructing the parliament from meeting for ten days. He also said that the parliamentarians were forced to meet in the open air, but even then, they drove us away by force. He demanded that the will of the national representatives of the Congo be respected by the United Nations.

In his telegram, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Kasongo, accused the UN authorities in Leopoldville of sabotage and demanded that the parliament be allowed to operate freely. He also revealed that three ships carrying Belgian troops were sailing to the Congo to strengthen the position of Mobutu and others. He demanded that "these troops be prevented from landing in the Congo."

Recently, a pamphlet against colonialism called "National Youth" has been circulating in the Congolese capital, expressing support for the Lumumba government and calling on the national youth to unite and "defend the motherland threatened by the colonialists."

　　参众两院议长致电支持卢蒙巴政府谴责“联合国军”在刚果的活动
    新华社24日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：刚果加丹加省人民不顾帝国主义及其走狗冲伯集团的血腥镇压，继续英勇地展开着维护独立和统一的爱国武装斗争。在这个省北部的马诺诺，反对殖民者和冲伯集团残暴统治的人民仍然控制着城郊的一些地区。他们已沿着公路每隔六百英尺筑起一处路障，准备进一步反击由比利时军官指挥的反动军警。
    据法新社23日报道，由于害怕人民的斗争，前往马诺诺活动的比利时驻伊利沙伯维尔总领事曾不得不在机场等候了两小时，以便“联合国军”把他护送到城里。
    在加丹加省省会伊利沙伯维尔以北的加米纳军事基地附近，也有一批巴卢巴人正在集中，准备向冲伯集团发动进攻。
    据冲伯集团“内政部”的一个发言人透露，加丹加省中部和北部的许多地方仍在起义者的控制之下。有消息说，人民群众的强大斗争已使冲伯集团感到惊恐不安，他们一面扬言要对爱国人民继续采取残酷镇压，一面赶忙要求那里的“联合国军”保护交通线和护送货车通行。联合国一名发言人22日宣布：“联合国军”将“接管”加丹加省加米纳—卢埃纳的铁路保护工作。在刚果首都利奥波德维尔，反对蒙博托叛乱集团的斗争也在发展中。据印度报业托辣斯23日报道，22日在蒙博托住所前举行示威的刚果士兵，曾在蒙博托的卫兵向他们开枪后愤怒地冲入军火库。当时，惊惶万状的蒙博托曾立即打电话向“联合国军”求援。消息说，联合国驻刚果当局竟公然派出“联合国军”把蒙博托从他的住所护送到利奥波德营去。据美国“时代”杂志最近一期透露，“蒙博托是经常访问美国大使馆的客人，同那里的官员举行长时间的会谈”。
    据刚果参议院议长23日在利奥波德维尔宣布：刚果参、众两院议长又分别打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，再次表示支持卢蒙巴政府，并抗议蒙博托等人的暴行以及“联合国军”在刚果的活动。
    奥基托在电报中谴责蒙博托封闭议会、迫害议员的暴行。他说，蒙博托等人十天来一直阻挠议会开会。他又说，议员们被迫在露天开会，但是，甚至这样，他们用武力赶走我们。他要求刚果全国代表的意志得到联合国的尊重。
    众议院议长卡松戈在电报中指责了联合国驻利奥波德维尔当局的破坏活动，并要求议会能够自由活动。他还揭露，有三艘载有比利时军队的船只正在驶往刚果来加强蒙博托等人的地位。他要求“阻止这些军队在刚果登陆”。
    最近，刚果首都流传着一本名叫“全国青年”的反对殖民主义的小册子，表示支持卢蒙巴政府，并号召全国青年团结起来，“保卫受到殖民主义者威胁的祖国”。
