Xinhua News Agency, Prague Dispatch: Czechoslovakia attaches great importance to utilizing waste materials to increase production and save raw materials and funds.

    A factory that uses waste wood and sawdust to manufacture particleboard has recently been put into production in Jihlava. This is the first such factory in Central Europe. The factory can produce enough particleboard for one hundred sets of furniture every twenty-four hours. By making full use of waste wood, Czechoslovakia can avoid felling 75,000 trees aged 60 to 80 years, or 86 hectares of forest, each year. In order to reduce the absolute consumption of felled timber during the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), Czechoslovakia has decided to build several more such factories, two of which are already under construction.

    充分利用废料　节约国家资源
    捷建成一座废木料木板厂
    据新华社布拉格电　捷克斯洛伐克很重视利用废料以增加生产和节约原材料和资金。
    一座利用废木料和木屑制造木板的工厂，最近已在伊赫拉伐投入生产。这是中欧的第一个这种工厂。这个工厂每二十四小时可以生产出一百套家俱所需要的木板。由于充分利用废木材，捷克斯洛伐克每年就可以不砍伐七万五千棵六十年至八十年的树，或八十六公顷的森林。为了在第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）中降低砍伐木材的绝对消费量，捷克斯洛伐克决定再修建若干这样的工厂，其中两个已经动工。
