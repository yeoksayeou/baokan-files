This newspaper reports from Wuhan on the 27th: The Liaoyehuzhong Production Team of Fengxi Commune in Zhuxi County, Hubei Province, based on the characteristics of the high mountainous areas, reformed the cultivation system and adopted the method of "digging two seasons with one hoe," that is, planting two or three crops with different maturity periods at one time, or interplanting the next season's crops when weeding the previous season's crops two or three times, expanding the replanting area, and changing one harvest a year to two harvests a year, providing a very good experience for increasing production in large mountainous areas. This year, this team has planted buckwheat on 210 mu of wheat stubble land, and interplanted 230 mu of wheat and 280 mu of overwintering crops such as rapeseed and oats while weeding corn two or three times.

The Liaoyehuzhong Production Team is located in a high mountain area with an altitude of 2,400 meters, with a cold climate, an annual frost-free period of only 120 to 150 days, and snow cover for more than five months. The harvest period for various crops is more than a month later than in the plains, and it has always been "one harvest a year on one piece of land in the high mountains."

In order to produce more grain, the Party branch of this team launched the masses before the summer harvest last year and summarized the method of "digging two seasons with one hoe." This method roughly has three types: the first is to interplant corn and soybeans in the potato fields when weeding for the first time (before Qingming Festival); the second is to plant late autumn crops such as buckwheat on vacant land or wheat stubble land, while planting overwintering crops such as rapeseed and oats; the third is to interplant rapeseed and oats and separately plant wheat when weeding corn for the second or third time (around the Beginning of Autumn). Last summer, this team had 342 mu of steep slope wheat stubble land and simultaneously sowed two crops with different harvest periods: buckwheat and rapeseed. Last year, they first harvested more than 21,000 jin of buckwheat, and in early summer this year, they harvested another 11,790 jin of rapeseed. This summer, they interplanted buckwheat, rapeseed, and oats on more than 500 mu of wheat stubble land. In autumn, they interplanted overwintering crops in more than 500 mu of cornfields, and these crops are now growing very well.

Experience has shown that the method of "digging two seasons with one hoe" can enable mountainous production to be sown early in a timely manner, seize the season, expand the replanting area, and improve land utilization. This year, the autumn harvest crop area of this team has expanded to more than 2,500 mu, more than 1,200 mu more than last year, and the replanting index has increased by more than 50%.

According to the team's experiments, as long as deep plowing and careful cultivation are carried out, sufficient fertilizer is applied, and management is meticulous, the yield of single planting is not much different from that of mixed planting. The team members' evaluation of this cultivation system reform is: "Sowing saves labor, every piece of land yields two seasons of bumper crops, extensive planting plus careful management, grain soars to the sky."

Due to the implementation of the "digging two seasons with one hoe" cultivation system, labor was saved, effectively solving the problem of uneven labor use, easing the very tight labor situation during busy seasons, and also providing part of the labor for sideline production, promoting an all-round leap forward in agriculture and sideline occupations. Last year, while ensuring the labor needs of agriculture, the whole team also extracted 13 laborers to engage in sideline occupations such as harvesting raw lacquer and cultivating medicinal materials. Although they suffered from a hundred-day drought, the average income per member was still higher than that of the Great Leap Forward in 1958.

The practice of the Liaoyehuzhong Production Team in reforming the cultivation system has attracted the attention of the Zhuxi County Party Committee and the Fengxi Commune Party Committee. According to incomplete statistics, the county has more than 50,000 mu of autumn harvest crops, interplanted with late autumn and next year's summer harvest crops. (Attached picture)

### 高寒山区也能一年两收　竹溪县推广辽叶湖生产队“一锄头挖两季”经验

　　高寒山区也能一年两收
　　竹溪县推广辽叶湖生产队“一锄头挖两季”经验
    本报武汉27日电　湖北省竹溪县丰溪公社辽叶湖生产队，根据大山区的特点，改革耕作制度，采取“一锄头挖两季”的办法，即一次种上两、三种成熟期不同的作物，或者在前一季作物锄二、三道草的时候间种下一季作物，扩大复种面积，变一年一收为一年两收，为大山区增产提供了很好的经验。今年，这个队已在二百一十亩麦茬地里种上了荞麦，并在锄苞谷二、三道草时，套种了二百三十亩小麦和二百八十亩油菜、燕麦等越冬作物。
    辽叶湖生产队处于海拔二千四百米高山，气候寒冷，每年的无霜期只有一百二十到一百五十天，积雪时间达五个多月。各种作物收获期比平原要晚一个多月，而且一向是“高山一块地，一年收一季”。
    为了增产更多的粮食，这个队的党支部早在去年夏收前便发动群众，总结出“一锄头挖两季”的办法。这个办法大体上有三种：第一种是在春洋芋的地里，锄头道草时（清明前），套种苞谷、黄豆；第二种是在空地或麦茬地里种晚秋作物荞麦的同时，种上油菜、燕麦等越冬作物；第三种是在苞谷锄二、三道草时（立秋前后），间种油菜、燕麦和单独点种小麦。这个队去年夏季有三百四十二亩陡坡小麦茬地，同时播种了荞麦和油菜两种收获期不同的作物。去年先收了二万一千多斤荞麦，今年夏初又收获了一万一千七百九十斤油菜籽。今年夏季，他们在五百多亩的小麦茬地里，混种了荞麦、油菜和燕麦。秋季又在五百多亩苞谷地里，间种了越冬作物，现在这些作物都生长的很好。
    经验证明，“一锄头挖两季”的办法，能使山区生产适时早播，抢住季节，并扩大复种面积，而且提高土地利用率。今年，这个队的秋收作物面积虽扩大到二千五百多亩，比去年多种一千二百多亩，复种指数提高了50％以上。
      根据这个队的试验，只要深耕细作，施足肥料，精心管理，单种与混种的产量相差不多。社员们对这种耕作制度改革的评价是：“播种省人工，地地两季丰，广种加细管，粮食冲天宫。”
      由于实行了“一锄头挖两季”的耕作制度，节省了劳力，有效地解决了劳力使用的忙闲不均现象，缓和了大忙季节的劳力十分紧张状况，还为副业提供了一部分劳力，促使农副业全面跃进。去年，全队在保证农业的劳力需要的同时，还抽出了十三个劳力经常搞收割生漆、培育药材等副业，虽然遭受了百日大旱，社员每人平均收入比大跃进的1958年还有所增长。
    辽叶湖生产队改革耕作制度的作法，引起了竹溪县委和丰溪公社党委的重视。据不完全统计，全县已有五万多亩秋收作物，套种、间种了晚秋和明年的夏收作物。（附图片）
