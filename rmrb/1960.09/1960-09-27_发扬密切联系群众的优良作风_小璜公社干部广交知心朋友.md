Promoting the Excellent Style of Close Ties with the Masses
Xiaohuang Commune Cadres Make Many Close Friends

    (By our newspaper) The cadres of Xiaohuang Commune in Dongxiang County, Jiangxi Province, promoting the excellent style of sharing weal and woe with the masses, have persisted in eating, living, and working with the masses for the two years since the establishment of the commune, integrating themselves with the masses, further strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses, and mobilizing the masses' enthusiasm for production, thereby promoting production.
    When the cadres of Xiaohuang Commune first implemented the "four togethers" with the masses, some cadres did not implement eating and living together resolutely enough. Therefore, they had more contact with the masses in labor, but had not fully integrated with the masses in life. The masses reflected that cadres "are farmers during labor, but cadres when they return home." In light of this situation, the Commune Party Committee made timely and conscientious efforts to resolve it. On the one hand, it seized typical examples to conduct ideological education for cadres, explaining that only by integrating with the masses in life can the commune members regard the cadres as confidants and better play their role in leading production. At the same time, it also adopted some specific measures to ensure that cadres better go among the masses. First, the commune cadre canteen was abolished, and all cadres ate at the production team canteens and ate the same food as the commune members. Second, except for returning to the commune for meetings and research work, all commune cadres lived with the commune members. Wherever the commune members lived, the cadres lived. Third, all cadres, according to their assigned areas, went deep into backward teams, backward villages, and backward fields to eat and live with the commune members. Fourth, a system of contacting the masses by household was implemented, requiring each cadre to make at least four to six poor and lower-middle peasants their close friends. In addition, a system of inspection and evaluation was established, with regular evaluations and public announcement of the evaluation results to commune members for supervision. In this way, a trend of eating and living together with the masses gradually formed among all cadres.
    Because the cadres insisted on eating and living with the masses, living entirely among the masses, the masses truly regarded the cadres as their confidants. The masses promptly reflected any opinions or requests to the cadres, and the cadres also consulted with the masses on any problems, so that many problems that were not easily discovered and resolved in the past could be discovered and resolved in a timely manner. Yulin Brigade was a backward team in production, one of the main reasons being that the water conservancy problem had not been solved. The commune planned to build a reservoir on Lion Mountain in this team, but the local people said that the underground leaked water and could not be built. After Xu Shunxi, the first secretary of the Commune Party Committee, and Secretary Xin Zhongxi went deep into Yulin Brigade, they became close friends with the masses while eating and living with the commune members. One day, they talked about the construction of the reservoir with commune members Wang Houquan, Wang Mamao, and others, and asked them whether the local soil was leaky. They said: "There is no water leakage, it is that everyone is reluctant to part with this place, fearing that moving will break up the village." After learning the truth, they conducted persuasive education targeting the commune members' concerns and assured them that they would be properly resettled after the relocation and that the people of the original village would not be dispersed. In this way, all sixty relocated commune members were willing to move. After the reservoir was built, it irrigated more than 2,000 mu of land, completely eliminating drought from all 1,900 mu of rice fields in the team. Shanbi Brigade is an advanced team in production. After Le Mingze, the head of the commune, arrived at this brigade, he lived in the home of commune member Wu Yinqi. While living together, he often chatted with Wu Yinqi and solicited his opinions on production. Once, Wu Yinqi said: "Our team's grain production is good in every way, but diversified management is a bit lacking. If this continues, we will grasp one end and lose the other, and our income will decrease in the future." Le Mingze attached great importance to this opinion. After learning from the brigade cadres that this was indeed the case, he immediately took measures to arrange a certain amount of labor to carry out collective livestock breeding, poultry farming, fish farming, and other sideline production while ensuring that grain production was given priority. The commune members were very satisfied.
    Because the cadres made close friends with the commune members, the commune members took the initiative to help with ideas when the cadres encountered difficulties in their work. Cadres eat and live with the masses, empathize with them, and understand and care more about the lives of the commune members. All the cadres of the commune eat in the canteen with the commune members, run the canteen, listen to the opinions of the masses, and improve operation and management.
    Now, all 164 canteens in the commune are getting better and better. The commune members said: "The cadres are really stewards of the family, they think of everything for us, even firewood, rice, oil, and salt!"

### 发扬密切联系群众的优良作风　小璜公社干部广交知心朋友

　　发扬密切联系群众的优良作风
　　小璜公社干部广交知心朋友
    本报讯　江西东乡县小璜公社全体干部，发扬与群众同甘共苦的优良作风，建社两年来坚持与群众同吃同住，和群众打成一片，进一步密切了党与群众的关系，调动了群众的生产积极性，推动了生产。
    小璜公社干部开始与群众实行“四同”时，部分干部对同吃同住执行得不够坚决，因此，只在同劳动中与群众联系较多，在生活上还没有完全和群众打成一片。群众反映干部“劳动是农民，回家是干部”。根据这种情况，公社党委作了及时认真的解决。一方面抓住典型事例向干部进行思想教育，说明只有在生活上和群众打成一片，社员才会把干部当成知己，更好地发挥领导生产的作用。同时，也采取了一些具体措施，保证干部更好地深入群众。第一，取消公社干部食堂、干部一律到生产队食堂和社员同桌吃饭、吃一样的饭。第二，公社干部除回到公社开会和研究工作以外，一律和社员同住，社员住在那里，干部住在那里。第三，所有干部按照自己的分工地区，深入落后队、落后村和落后田，与社员同吃同住。第四，实行分户联系群众制度，要求每个干部至少交四到六户贫农和下中农的知心朋友。另外，还建立了检查评比制度，定期评比，向社员公布评比结果，以便社员监督。这样在全体干部中，便逐步形成了与群众同吃同住的风气。
    由于干部坚持与群众同吃同住，完全生活在群众当中，群众便真正把干部当成自己的知心人。群众有什么意见、要求，及时向干部反映，干部有什么问题，也找群众商量，使过去许多在生产中不容易发现和解决的问题，都能及时发现和解决。榆林大队是生产上的落后队，主要原因之一是水利问题没有解决。公社准备在这一队的狮子山修建一座水库，当地群众说地下漏水，不能修。公社党委第一书记徐顺喜和书记辛仲西，深入榆林大队后，在与社员同吃同住中，和群众交成知心朋友。一天，他们与社员王后全、王马茂等谈起修水库的事，问他们当地土质是不是漏水。他们说：“哪里漏水，是大家舍不得这块地方，怕搬家拆散了村子。”他们了解到真实情况后，便针对社员的顾虑，进行了说服教育，并保证迁移之后妥善安置，不拆散原来村子的人。这样，迁移的六十户社员人人乐意。水库建成之后，灌田二千多亩，使全队一千九百多亩稻田全部根除了旱灾。珊壁大队是生产上的先进队。公社社长乐明则到这个大队后，住在社员吴银期家里。在同住中，他经常和吴银期拉家常，征求他对生产的意见。有一次，吴银期说：“我们队粮食生产样样都好，就是多种经营差点劲。长此下去，抓一头，丢一头，将来收入就会减少。”乐明则很重视这个意见，经向大队干部了解，情况确实如此。于是立即采取措施，在保证首先抓好粮食生产的同时，安排一定的劳动力，开展了集体养畜、养禽、养鱼和其他副业生产。社员都很满意。
    由于干部和社员交成知心朋友，干部在工作中碰到困难，社员都主动帮助出主意。干部与群众同吃同住，设身处地，更加了解和关心社员生活。全社干部与社员一起吃食堂，办食堂，倾听群众意见，改进经营管理。
    现在公社的一百六十四个食堂，都越办越好。社员们说：“干部真是管家人，柴米油盐样样都为我们想到了！”
