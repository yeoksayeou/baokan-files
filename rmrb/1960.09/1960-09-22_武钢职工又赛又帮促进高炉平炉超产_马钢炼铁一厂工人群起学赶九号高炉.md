Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 21st: Wuhan Iron and Steel's workers have launched a vigorous production increase and economy drive, wholeheartedly promoting high-quality and high-yield steel production.

The workers of the ironmaking plant are carrying out a comprehensive competition with two giant blast furnaces as the leading force. The workers of the two major blast furnaces use output, quality, tapping times, and collaboration as ten competition conditions, evaluating daily, recording scores for each shift, promoting each other, and improving together. On September 2nd, the workers of No. 1 blast furnace improved the slag notch operating technology, producing more than 200 tons of iron than No. 2 blast furnace, and first won the red flag; the next day, the workers of No. 2 blast furnace immediately took measures such as strengthening iron notch maintenance, which led to a sharp increase in output of more than 300 tons that day, regaining the red flag. To consolidate their achievements, the workers of No. 2 blast furnace also adopted a combination of top-down methods to carry out a vigorous tackling performance competition in planning and scheduling, raw material management, and equipment maintenance. At the same time, the Party committee of the ironmaking plant strengthened various tasks outside the blast furnace, mobilizing units such as the raw material workshop to clean up the site, inspect hidden equipment hazards, and establish and improve various systems, creating better conditions for blast furnace production.

The workers of each open hearth furnace in the steelmaking plant launched a fast steelmaking performance competition. The workers of No. 2 open hearth furnace promoted the spirit of cooperation, and on the basis of maintaining the furnace body, vigorously engaged in more charging and rapid smelting, repeatedly refining fast and high-quality steel, setting an example among the furnaces. No. 3 open hearth furnace, which had recently been overhauled and put into production, launched a competition to learn from, catch up with, and surpass No. 2 open hearth furnace, and also quickly shortened the smelting time and refined fast and high-quality steel.

As the main base for supplying high-grade materials to the blast furnace, the sintering plant, all the workers vigorously attacked the key to production and carried out team competitions, promoting a substantial increase in the output of sintered ore. In the first half of September, the plant's sintered ore output increased by more than double that of the second half of August, and the iron content was above the specified standard.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, September 21st: The workers of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company's Ironmaking Plant No. 1 have launched a production increase and economy drive centered on "learning from No. 9 blast furnace, catching up with No. 9 blast furnace, and surpassing No. 9 blast furnace," so that the experience of No. 9 blast furnace can be quickly popularized to various blast furnaces, pushing production to a new level. From September 1st to 13th, the plant's average daily production level increased by 8.4% compared with the last ten days of the previous month, the quality of pig iron gradually increased, and the ironmaking coke ratio of half of the blast furnaces was reduced to below 0.8.

No. 9 blast furnace is a rising star of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company. Originally, this blast furnace was in the "middle reaches" of the plant. In this production increase and economy movement, the workers of No. 9 blast furnace set high ambitions to strive for the upper reaches, and changed the backwardness of production in one fell swoop. Various production indicators quickly surpassed the advanced collective of No. 13 blast furnace, which attended the National Heroes Conference last year, and won the honorary title of "Pace-setter Furnace" among the company's medium-sized blast furnaces. The plant Party committee attached great importance to the advanced experience they created for high yield, high quality, and low consumption, and called on all ironmaking workers in the plant to learn and promote the experience of No. 9 blast furnace.

The workers of each blast furnace responded enthusiastically to the call of the Party committee, and in response to the key problems existing in production, they formulated a plan for learning from No. 9 blast furnace in accordance with the principle of learning what is needed and making up for what is lacking, and quickly launched a heat wave of catching up with No. 9 blast furnace. Kang Jianguo, deputy secretary of the Party branch of No. 10 blast furnace, personally led more than 20 people, including foremen, furnace chiefs, and furnace front workers, to No. 9 blast furnace to "obtain scriptures." They applied the learned experience in combination with the production conditions of their own blast furnace, thus increasing the daily production level sharply by 7%. The third shift foreman of No. 13 blast furnace went to No. 9 blast furnace three times to learn unified operating experience, promoting production to rise steadily. The hot blast furnace Yang Wenxiang team adopted the method of learning, investigating, and acting simultaneously to promote the advanced experience of No. 9 blast furnace, making the hot blast furnace burn more evenly and the wind temperature rise significantly, creating conditions for further increasing production and reducing the coke ratio.

　　武钢职工又赛又帮促进高炉平炉超产
　　马钢炼铁一厂工人群起学赶九号高炉
    据新华社武汉21日电　武钢职工展开热火朝天的增产节约竞赛，一条心一股劲地促进钢铁优质高产。
    炼铁厂职工以两座巨型高炉为龙头开展一条龙竞赛。两大高炉的职工以产量、质量、出铁次数、协作等十个项目为竞赛条件，天天评比，班班记分，互相促进，共同提高。9月2日，一号高炉职工改进渣口操作技术，比二号高炉多产铁二百多吨，首先得到了红旗；第二天，二号高炉职工立即采取了加强铁口维护等措施，使当天产量猛增三百多吨，夺回了红旗。为巩固成绩，二号高炉职工们还采用上下结合的办法，在计划调度、原料管理、设备维护等方面开展了轰轰烈烈的攻关表演赛。与此同时，炼铁厂党委加强了高炉外围的各项工作，发动原料车间等单位清扫现场、检查设备隐患和建立健全各项制度，为高炉生产创造了更好的条件。
    炼钢厂各平炉职工展开了快速炼钢表演赛。二号平炉职工发扬协作精神，在维护好炉体的基础上大搞多装快炼，接连多次炼出快速优质钢，在各炉间树立了榜样。新近检修完毕投入生产的三号平炉，开展了学、赶、超二号平炉的竞赛，也迅速缩短了冶炼时间，炼出了快速优质钢。
    作为供给高炉主要精料基地的烧结厂，全体职工猛攻生产关键，开展班组竞赛，促进了烧结矿产量大幅度增长。9月上半月，全厂烧结矿产量比8月下半月提高了一倍以上，而且含铁量都在规定标准以上。
    据新华社合肥21日电　马鞍山钢铁公司炼铁一厂职工掀起了以“学九号高炉、赶九号高炉、超九号高炉”为中心的增产节约竞赛，使九号高炉的经验迅速普及到各个高炉，把生产推向一个新的水平。从9月1日到13日，全厂平均日产水平比上月下旬增长了8.4％，生铁质量步步上升，而且有半数高炉的炼铁焦比降低到了零点八以下。
    九号高炉是马鞍山钢铁公司的后起之秀。原来这座高炉在全厂处于“中游”状态。在这次增产节约运动中，九号高炉职工树雄心争上游，一举改变了生产落后面貌，各项生产指标都迅速赶过了去年出席全国群英会的先进集体——十三号高炉，获得了全公司中型高炉“标兵炉”的光荣称号。厂党委十分重视他们创造的一套高产、优质、低耗的先进经验，号召全厂炼铁职工学习和推广九号高炉的经验。
    各高炉的职工热烈响应党委的号召，针对生产中存在的关键问题，按照需要什么学什么，缺什么补什么的原则，制定了学习九号高炉的规划，并且迅速掀起了赶九号高炉的热潮。十号高炉党支部副书记康建国亲自带领工长、炉长、炉前工等二十多人，到九号高炉“取经”。他们把学得来的经验结合自己高炉生产情况，加以运用，因而使日产水平猛增7％。十三号高炉三班工长三次到九号高炉学习统一操作经验，推动生产节节上升。热风炉杨文祥小组采取边学、边查、边行动的办法，推行了九号高炉的先进经验，使热风炉燃烧得更均匀，风温显著上升，为进一步提高产量、降低焦比创造了条件。
