　　The No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant is boiling! The labor enthusiasm of the steel warriors is like the boiling molten steel in the furnace, with surging heat waves and rolling waves.
　　In recent days, the workers have taken even bigger steps, braving high temperatures and facing the raging furnace fire, making the competition extremely lively. In particular, the Communist Party members are all contributing ideas to realize the ten measures for increasing production and practicing economy, and everyone is making contributions to the ten guarantees. When you come to this factory, you can hear the masses of the people praising the many moving deeds of the 190 Party members everywhere...

　　Old Model Makes Contributions While Sick
　　This was a high-yield day. At night, strong red light flashed on the windows from time to time, followed by bursts of steel tapping sounds and the roar of the rolling mill.
　　Communist Party member Zhang Wenjin, an old worker model who was promoted to deputy director of the factory, who was recuperating at home after recovering from a serious illness, sometimes lay blankly on the armchair, sometimes stood up and stared out the window, and sometimes sat at the desk and pondered. His heart was closely linked to the steelmaking furnace, and he couldn't wait to rush to the furnace and fight alongside the workers to break through the production bottleneck of long smelting time. It was already late at night. Zhang Wenjin stood up and looked out the window. Down the mountain, chimneys stood tall, and clouds of various colors billowed from the tops of the chimneys. Zhang Wenjin recognized the two chimneys that belonged to his factory at a glance. He stared intently at the black shadows of these two giant chimneys and suddenly saw bright flames rising from the chimney. He was stunned and immediately became nervous: "Oh no, the gas furnace is in bad shape!"
　　He wanted to rush to the factory immediately, but he couldn't. He had just recovered from a serious illness, and he was weak. He only felt dizzy after taking a few steps out of his door. What to do? He had no choice but to call the factory. He turned around, walked to the bed, and quickly picked up the microphone: "Hello, is this the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop? Please find the Party Committee Secretary!"
　　The person who answered the phone was the Party Committee Propaganda Officer. He replied: "Party Committee Secretary Cao Hechang has gone to the site! Director Zhang, are you feeling better?" "Hey, please tell Secretary Cao that the chimney is billowing with red flames, like lighting a candle. Check it quickly. The gas is a bit abnormal!" The propaganda officer immediately told the Party Committee Secretary about the problem raised by Zhang Wenjin and immediately conducted an inspection. As Zhang Wenjin expected, the gas duct leading to the open hearth furnace was blocked. The Party Committee Secretary promptly convened a furnace-side meeting and immediately organized forces to carry out a rush repair.
　　Zhang Wenjin stayed at home and was very uneasy. He was anxious to know what measures the factory had taken. He couldn't wait to call the factory again to ask.
　　"Hello! Director Zhang, all the problems have been identified and can be repaired immediately, don't worry!" The other party said to Zhang Wenjin on the phone: "You can see the problems that are about to happen to the gas furnace while you are sick at home. Everyone is very touched. They all say that if Director Zhang hadn't called quickly, today's high temperature would have been affected. The situation is very good now, and this furnace of steel is about to be tapped."
　　Zhang Wenjin put down the microphone and breathed a sigh of relief. He looked at the chimney again, and the red flames had gradually subsided, but his face was full of joyful red light.

　　Contestants Achieve Success Together
　　One day in late August, the sky had just turned fish-belly white when several workers on the early shift in the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop came to the changing room. They gathered together, wondering what they were discussing. Suddenly, another worker came in. A young and energetic lad immediately shouted loudly: "Master Huang, our Party group of No. 1 Furnace has already discussed it. We want to challenge your No. 2 Furnace. The competition conditions are to see who implements the ten measures better, loads more, refines faster, and produces high quality and high output!"
　　"Okay, our No. 2 Furnace will resolutely accept the challenge!" The person called Master Huang replied readily. This person's name was Huang Shaorong. He was the Party group leader of No. 2 Furnace and the deputy leader of the smelting team. He was in his forties and full of energy. In order to realize the ten measures proposed to the Party by all Party members, he hadn't slept for a long time last night, thinking about producing more steel and better steel, so he had to fully mobilize the masses and work hard. The current key to smelting is the long time. If the smelting time can be shortened further, more steel can be produced for the country. He came to the factory early this morning to mobilize the Party group of No. 2 Furnace to challenge No. 1 Furnace. But he didn't expect that the people from No. 1 Furnace would arrive earlier than him. He heard Zhang Fashui, the Party group leader of No. 1 Furnace, issue a challenge, which was exactly what he wanted. He thought: "That's great, young people are energetic and promising!"
　　More than an hour before work, the people from the two furnaces went to the furnace ahead of time to prepare.
　　The furnace fire roared. After the No. 2 Furnace poured the last bag of molten iron, the sampling and analysis results showed that the sulfur content was still quite high. Huang Shaorong counted on his fingers: With such high sulfur and such low slag alkalinity, the smelting time of this furnace of steel would have to be extended if this continued! It was almost time for the shift change, and he thought that this was a good opportunity to mobilize everyone, so he discussed it with the team leader, Communist Party member Zhuo Shuyun, and immediately convened an expanded meeting of the furnace-side Party group. Huang Shaorong said to his comrades: "Reporting to everyone a good news, today No. 1 Furnace has challenged us..."
　　"Resolutely accept the challenge!" More than a dozen people shouted before Lao Huang finished speaking.
　　"There are now several problems. The sulfur content cannot be reduced, and the slag alkalinity is too low." Zhuo Shuyun took advantage of everyone's high morale to accept the challenge and immediately raised the question and discussed it with everyone: "Everyone give ideas, what should we do?"
　　"Add two more scoops of lime to increase the alkalinity!" The speaker was Fang Delu, a student worker who had just come to the furnace not long ago.
　　"No, although it saves effort to put lime in with the charging box, the lime won't spread out and will reduce the temperature in the furnace."
　　"Comrades," Huang Shaorong said decisively, "Let's add lime with a shovel, add a little at a time, and add it more times. This way, we can maintain the furnace temperature. High sulfur is afraid of high temperature. High temperature plus high enthusiasm. With these two things, sulfur will be doomed!"
　　"Agreed! Let's do it this way!" Everyone agreed.
　　A fierce battle began in front of the No. 2 Furnace. In the blink of an eye, dozens of shovels were lined up on the platform. Huang Shaorong scooped up lime, faced the raging furnace fire, and was the first to rush to the furnace door. A long line had already been formed behind him. In an instant, only shovels were seen flying, and lime was shoveled into the furnace cavity one by one. The furnace door spewed out long tongues of fire, scorching the human body, and the workers' clothes were immediately soaked with sweat.
　　Soon, the first round of the steel seizure battle in No. 2 Furnace ended. The sulfur content reached the prescribed standard in less than three hours of refining, creating a new record for the shortest refining period.
　　The young men of No. 1 Furnace were working hard. When they saw their opponents take the lead, they felt even hotter in their hearts. They were all eager to catch up with No. 2 Furnace.
　　The Party members and activists of No. 1 Furnace held a furnace-side meeting together, and then a steel seizure battle to catch up with No. 2 Furnace fiercely unfolded. Time passed second by second, and the boiling molten steel in the furnace stirred up layers of waves. The sulfur content of the steel was rapidly decreasing...
　　Half an hour later, No. 1 Furnace tapped the steel. The loudspeaker immediately broadcast the good news of the battle: No. 2 Furnace created a new record, and No. 1 Furnace also caught up. The first battle of the two furnaces ended in success, and the hourly output of steel from No. 1 Furnace reached thirteen tons, which is the latest record for loading more and refining faster in this furnace.

　　Team Leader Liu Helps Others
　　Iron melting workers show their heroism, helping others with high style,
　　Unite as one to seize high yields, vigorously promote cooperation and raise the red flag.
　　It was another high-yield night. The clock had just pointed to ten o'clock, and the No. 2 iron melting furnace was tapping iron again. The furnace mouth radiated strong red light, illuminating the workshop and dyeing the blue night sky red. At this moment, the molten iron from the No. 3 iron melting furnace was also tapped. However, since this furnace had only been tapped recently, the tapping hole was blocked by residue, and the inside and outside of the tapping trough were covered with iron slag, making it difficult to clean up for a while. This not only prevented the No. 3 iron melting furnace from continuing to tap iron, but also would pose a great threat to the high output of the open hearth furnace because it could not supply "food and grass" to the open hearth furnace in time.
　　"What to do?" The workers of the No. 3 iron melting furnace were anxious. So, everyone tried hard to clean up the residue while discussing:
　　"The open hearth furnace has all leaped forward, we can't hold the open hearth furnace back!"
　　"Yes! If the molten iron doesn't come out, the open hearth furnace will be starving!"
　　"Do it! Just do it all out!"
　　At this time, Liu Shihai, the team leader of the No. 2 iron melting furnace and a Communist Party member, was leading everyone to clean up the slag. He turned his head and suddenly found that the workers of the No. 3 furnace were in trouble. A thought flashed through his mind: No! If the No. 3 furnace stops production, the high output of the entire factory will not be guaranteed! We can't just watch them worry. So, he decisively waved his hand, and the workers of the No. 2 furnace quickly gathered around.
　　"Comrades! We are going to support the No. 3 furnace immediately!" Liu Shihai continued with a tone of soliciting opinions: "Does everyone have any objections?"
　　"Okay, no objections!" Most people raised their hands in agreement.
　　At this time, someone interjected: "That won't work, we haven't cleaned up our iron slag yet, and besides, the furnace is about to tap iron!"
　　Liu Shihai thought for a while and said with a smile: "What are we striving for by producing more iron?"
　　"That goes without saying! It's for producing more steel!"
　　"That's right! It's not enough for just our furnace to produce more iron," Liu Shihai said, "The entire factory is a coordinated effort. To seize high output, every chess piece and every move must be closely linked. Otherwise, this game of chess will not be played well."
　　"Go! Let's do it! We'll all go to the No. 3 furnace!" Before Liu Shihai finished speaking, a young iron melting worker took an iron rod and left. Then everyone rushed to the No. 3 furnace...
　　Ten minutes later, the tapping hole was opened, and the residue in the tapping trough was also cleaned up. The workers of the No. 3 furnace said to Liu Shihai with unusual emotion: "Team Leader Liu, you must be exhausted!"
　　"It's nothing!" Liu Shihai replied with a hearty laugh: "Everyone felt very uncomfortable seeing that you were in trouble. To be honest, we would be really anxious if the molten iron could not be tapped in time!" Immediately, the blower sang more happily, and the No. 3 iron melting furnace blazed fiercely, with sparks flying everywhere. Everything returned to normal. As for Liu Shihai, he had taken everyone back to the No. 2 furnace and continued to clean up the slag next to his furnace.

　　In these boiling days, the vanguard warriors of the working class in the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop are striding forward and advancing triumphantly towards higher goals in order to realize the ten measures and achieve high-yield and high-quality production.

　　永远走在前面
    重钢平炉一厂沸腾起来了！钢铁战士的劳动热情像炉内沸腾的钢水，热浪滔滔，波涛滚滚。
    近几天来，工人们迈开了更大的步伐，冒着高温，迎着熊熊炉火，把竞赛搞得热火朝天。特别是共产党员，人人在为实现增产节约的十大措施献计，个个都为十大保证立功。当你来到这个厂，随处都可以听到广大群众齐声称赞一百九十名党员的许许多多动人事迹……。
        老模范病中立功
    这是一个高产日。夜晚，窗上不时闪映着强烈的红光，随着红光而来的是阵阵出钢的钟声和轧钢机的轰鸣。
    重病初愈正在家中休养的共产党员、由老工人模范提升为副厂长的张文金，时而呆呆地躺在靠椅上，时而站起来向窗外凝视，时而坐在桌旁伏案沉思。他的心和炼钢炉紧结在一起，巴不得一下跑到炉前，和工人们一起战斗，突破冶炼时间长的生产关键。这时已是深夜。张文金站起来向窗前了望。山下，烟囱林立，烟囱顶上冒着五颜六色的云烟。张文金一下就认得出那两个是自己厂里的烟囱。他目不转睛地凝视着这两座巨人似的烟囱黑影，忽然看见烟囱里直冒明火。他怔住了，心里顿时紧张起来：“糟了，煤气炉情况不好！”
    他想马上跑到厂里去，可是不行啊，重病初愈，人软体弱，他跨出家门口刚走了几步，便觉得头昏眼花。怎么办？只好打个电话到厂里去。他转过身来，走到床边，迅速拿起话筒：“喂，平炉一厂吗？请找党委书记！”
    接电话的是党委宣传干事。他回答说：“党委书记曹合昌同志到现场去了！张厂长，你的病好了没有？”“喂，请你告诉曹书记，烟囱里一股劲冒红火，像点蜡烛一样，赶快检查一下，煤气有些不大正常！”宣传干事马上把张文金提出的问题告诉了党委书记，并且立即进行了检查。果然不出张文金所料，煤气通向平炉的烟道被堵塞了。党委书记及时召开了炉边会议，马上组织力量进行突击。
    张文金呆在家里十分不安，他急于想知道厂里采取了什么措施。他迫不及待地又一次打电话到厂里去问。
    “喂！张厂长，一切问题都查明了，马上就可以抢修好，你放心吧！”对方在电话上对张文金说：“你生病在家把煤气炉将要发生的问题都看出来了，大家很感动，都说不是张厂长的电话来得快，今天的高温就会受到影响，现在的情况好得很，这炉钢马上就要出炉了。”
    张文金放下话筒，舒展了一口气。他再看看烟囱，红火已渐渐收敛了，而他脸上却堆满了喜悦的红光。
        对手赛双双告捷
    8月下旬的一天，天刚现出鱼肚白，平炉一厂就有好几个上早班的工人来到了更衣室，他们围在一起不知道在商量什么。忽然又有一个工人进来了。一个年轻精悍的小伙子马上高声喊道：“黄师傅，我们一号炉党小组已经商量好啦，要向你们二号炉挑战，竞赛条件是看谁贯彻十大措施好，多装快炼，优质高产！”
    “好，我们二号炉坚决应战！”被叫做黄师傅的人爽快地回答。这人名叫黄绍荣，是二号炉党小组长，又是冶炼班副班长。年纪四十开外，精力充沛。他为着实现全体党员向党提出的十大措施，昨夜很久没有入睡，想着要多炼钢，炼好钢，就得把群众充分发动起来，大干特干。当前的冶炼关键是时间长，要能把冶炼时间再缩短些，就能为国家增产更多的钢。今天，他一早赶进厂来就是为着发动二号炉党小组和一号炉挑战。却没有想到，一号炉的人比自己还来得早。他听了一号炉党小组长张发水提出挑战，正合心意，心想：“真是好样的，年轻人干劲大，有出息！”
    离上班还有一个多小时，两个炉子的人都提前上炉前作准备。
    炉火呼呼吼啸。二号炉倒完了最后一包铁水，取样化验的结果是：含硫率还相当高。黄绍荣扳起指头一算：硫这么高，渣子的碱度这么低，拖下去，这炉钢的冶炼时间又得拉长！快接班了，他想到这正是发动大家的好机会，便同班长、共产党员卓树云商量，马上召开了炉边党小组扩大会议。黄绍荣向战友们说：“报告大家一个好消息，今天一号炉向我们挑战了……”
    “坚决应战！”十几个人不等老黄说完，喊了起来。
    “现在有几个问题，含硫率降不下来，渣子的碱度又太低。”卓树云乘着大家应战的高昂情绪，立即把问题提出来和大家商量：“大家出主意，怎么办？”
    “多加两斗石灰把碱度提起来！”说话的是刚来炉前不久的学工方德禄。
    “不行，用料斗进石灰，虽然省劲，但石灰散不开，会降低炉内温度。”
      “同志们，”黄绍荣当机立断地说：“还是用洋锹加石灰，一次少加些，多加几次，这样就可以保持炉温，高硫怕高温，高温加干劲，有了这两条，硫磺就没命啦！”
    “赞成！就这么干！”大家的意见一致了。
    二号炉前激烈的战斗开始了。一眨眼，平台上哗啦啦地摆出了几十把洋锹，黄绍荣撮满石灰，迎着熊熊的炉火，头一个冲向炉门。后面早已接成了一条长龙，顷刻间，只见洋锹飞舞，石灰一锹接一锹地投向炉腔，炉门喷出长长的火舌，直燎人体，工人们的衣服顿时被汗水湿透了。
    不久，二号炉夺钢战斗的第一个回合结束了。精炼不到三个小时，含硫率达到了规定的标准，创造了精炼期最短的新纪录。
    一号炉的小伙子们正干得起劲，一见他们的对手捷足先登，心里更热了，都磨拳擦掌，一定要赶上二号炉。
    一号炉的党员和积极分子在一起开了个炉边会议，跟着一场追赶二号炉的夺钢战斗就激烈地展开了。时间一秒一秒地过去了，炉内沸腾的钢水翻起了层层浪花。钢的含硫率在迅速地下降着……。
    半小时以后，一号炉出钢了，扩音器里立刻传来了战斗喜讯：二号炉创造了新纪录，一号炉也迎头赶上，两个炉子对手赛的第一战役双告捷，一号炉钢的小时产量达到了十三吨，是这届炉子多装快炼的最新纪录。
        刘班长助人为乐
    化铁工人逞英豪，助人为乐风格高，
    团结一心夺高产，大兴协作红旗飘。
    又是一个高产日的晚上。时钟刚指十点，二号化铁炉又出铁了。炉口内射着强烈的红光，红光照亮了车间，染红了蓝色的夜空。正当这个时候，三号化铁炉的铁水也出炉了。但是，由于这个炉子才出铁不久，出铁口被残渣堵塞了，出铁槽的里里外外，已结满了铁渣，一时很难清除干净，这样，不仅使三号化铁炉不能继续出铁，并且由于不能及时给平炉供应“粮草”，将会给平炉高产造成极大的威胁。
    “怎么办？”三号化铁炉的工人急了，于是，大家一面使劲清理残渣，一面纷纷议论开来：
    “平炉全跃上去啦，我们不能扯平炉的后腿！”
    “是呀！铁水不出来，平炉就吃不饱！”
      “干！一股劲干了再说！”
    这时，二号化铁炉的班长、共产党员刘世海，正率领大家忙着清渣。他扭过头来忽然发现三号炉的工人遇到了困难，脑子一闪：不行！要是三号炉停了产，全厂的高产就保不住！我们不能眼看他们着急。于是，他当机立断地把手一招，二号炉的工人很快就围拢了过来。
    “同志们！我们马上去支援三号炉！”刘世海带着征求意见的口吻继续说道：“大家有没有意见？”
      “行，没有意见！”大多数都举手赞成。
    这时，不知是谁插了一句：“不行吧，我们的铁渣没有清完，再说炉子也快出铁了！”
    刘世海想了想，笑着说：“我们争取多出铁是为了什么？”
      “这还用问！是为了多产钢嘛！”
      “对！光是我们这个炉子多出铁还不行，”刘世海说：“全厂一盘棋，要夺高产，每一个棋子，每一着棋都扣得很紧，要不，这盘棋就下不好。”
      “走！说干就干，我们都到三号炉去！”刘世海的话还没说完，一个青年化铁工便拿着铁杆走了，接着大家争先恐后地涌向三号炉……。
    十分钟以后，出铁口打通了，出铁槽的残渣也清干净了，三号炉的工人异常感动地对刘世海说：“刘班长，可把你们累坏了！”
      “没有什么！”刘世海豪爽地笑着回答说：“大家见你们遇到了困难，心里怪难受。说实在的，要是铁水不能及时出炉，那可真要把我们急死啦！”马上，鼓风机更加欢畅地歌唱起来，三号化铁炉烈焰熊熊，火花四射，一切都恢复了正常。而刘世海呢，已带着大家回到了二号炉，继续在自己的炉子旁边忙着清渣。
              ×　×　×
    在这些沸腾的日子里，平炉一厂的工人阶级的先锋战士为了实现十大措施，达到高产优质，正向着更高的目标昂首阔步，高歌猛进。
