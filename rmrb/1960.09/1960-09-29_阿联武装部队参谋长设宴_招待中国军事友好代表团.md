Also present were high-ranking military officers of the United Arab Republic.

General Zhang Zongxun spoke at the banquet. He said, "Our two peoples share a common desire to oppose imperialist aggression, defend our territorial sovereignty, and safeguard world peace. The Chinese people and army greatly admire the heroism displayed by the people and army of the United Arab Republic in the struggle against imperialist armed aggression in 1956. We believe that your victory in the struggle against aggression and in defense of national independence is our own victory, and the victory of all peace-loving people in the world."

General Zhang Zongxun then said, "The struggle of all countries in the world for peace and independence and against aggression is mutually supportive. We thank the government of the United Arab Republic for its support in striving to restore China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. The Chinese people have always supported the just struggle of the people of the United Arab Republic against imperialism."

He said that the Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported the national liberation struggle of the Algerian people, the just struggle of the Congolese people against imperialist aggression, and all national liberation movements engaged in opposing imperialist aggression and defending national independence. The Chinese people will always be the most loyal and reliable friends of the Arab and African peoples.

Lieutenant General Amer first made a brief speech at the banquet. He extended the warmest welcome to the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation on behalf of the Armed Forces of the United Arab Republic. He said that for centuries, the United Arab Republic and China have been fighting against tyranny and imperialism, and finally achieved freedom and independence. He hoped that the United Arab Republic and China would share peace and prosperity in the future.

Lieutenant General Amer then said, "I think I also have a responsibility to express our deepest gratitude to the great people of the People's Republic of China for the moral and material assistance they gave to our cause during the Suez Canal crisis. These assistances have left a deep and grateful impression in the hearts of our people." He said that the people of the United Arab Republic are closely watching with great admiration the great progress made by the Chinese people in all aspects of life, and the contribution made by the Chinese armed forces to world peace.
