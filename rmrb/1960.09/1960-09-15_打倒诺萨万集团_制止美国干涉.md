Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 14th: The Lao Fighting Units Radio broadcast on the evening of the 13th the statement issued by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front on the same day regarding the establishment of the so-called "Revolutionary Committee" by the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Naciam paseuth group. The statement condemned Phoumi Nosavan for following the orders of U.S. imperialism and, with the help of the reactionaries in Thailand and South Vietnam, forming this "Committee" in order to realize the aggressive conspiracy of U.S. imperialism.

The statement said that all facts prove that the conspiracy of the so-called "Revolutionary Committee" is to: divide the country, overthrow the Phouma government, undermine national harmony and national unity, expand the civil war, continue to brutally persecute and slaughter the people and carry out sabotage activities, obstruct Laos from moving towards a truly peaceful and neutral path, closely collude with the reactionaries of Thailand and South Vietnam, and sell Laos to U.S. imperialism, thereby turning Laos into their new type of colony and war base. This is a serious threat to our motherland and people, which not only intensifies the situation in Laos but also threatens the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The statement said, "At a time when the motherland is in dire straits, for the survival of the motherland and for the territorial integrity of Laos, the Lao Patriotic Front earnestly appeals to all compatriots, including all ethnic groups, all strata, all political parties, and all patriotic and peace-loving people, to unite against U.S. imperialist interference and aggression, against the 'Revolutionary Committee' of the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Naciam paseuth rebel group, against all the traitorous and divisive acts of this group, and to support the legitimate Phouma government and the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le in defending the motherland, defending religion, defending the king and the constitution, and the policies of peace, neutrality, national harmony, and national unification."

The statement said that the Lao Patriotic Front is always ready to cooperate with all political parties, governments at all levels, and organizations that are willing to strive to realize the policies of peace, neutrality, national harmony, and national unification put forward by the legitimate Phouma government and the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le. The Lao Fighting Units and the People's Armed Forces are ready to cooperate with the officers and soldiers of the Royal Army who oppose the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Naciam paseuth rebel group and are willing to implement the policies put forward by the Phouma government and the coup committee.

The statement said, "If any officers or soldiers of the Royal Army refuse to respond to the call of the Phouma government and the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le, and stubbornly follow the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Naciam paseuth rebel group to become enemies of the people, then the people and the People's Armed Forces will resolutely eliminate them."

The statement said that the Lao Patriotic Front calls on all officers and soldiers of the Royal Army and the people to overthrow the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Naciam paseuth rebel group and oppose U.S. imperialist intervention.

The statement concluded, "The just struggle of the Lao people will surely win! The dark conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Naciam paseuth rebel group will surely be completely defeated!"

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 14th: According to the Lao Fighting Units Radio broadcast on the 13th, the people of Laos are continuing to hold rallies and pass resolutions in support of the policies of peace, neutrality, and national harmony announced by the Phouma government and the coup committee.

The radio station said that from August 23rd to 30th, about 5,000 people in Khammouane Province held rallies one after another and passed more than 140 resolutions to the King, Prince Phouma, the new government, and the National Assembly. These resolutions all called on the King to urge the new government to implement a policy of peace and neutrality and to achieve national harmony; called on the government, the National Assembly, and Prince Phouma to earnestly fulfill the policies they had announced; supported the statement of Captain Kong Le, Chairman of the coup committee; and opposed the participation of the traitor Phoumi Nosavan in the Phouma government.

The radio station also reported on the same day that the masses of the people in the southern region of Laos and along Route 13, in coordination with the People's Armed Forces, are destroying some highway bridges to oppose the "sweeping" operations of the Phoumi Nosavan group's troops, persecuting the people, and attacking Vientiane.

Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: Bangkok News: The reactionary group of Sarit Thanarat in Thailand is clamoring for the U.S.-controlled Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to take action to interfere in the internal affairs of Laos.

According to a report in the "Siam Rath" on the 12th, Surajit, the Thai Army Chief of Staff and military advisor to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, told reporters on the 11th that he actually called the rebellion jointly launched by Phoumi Nosavan and Boun Oum-Naciam paseuth a "revolution." He clamored, "If the Phouma government does not recognize this revolution, thereby causing military conflict, then the Phouma government should be responsible for the events that occur."

Surajit made excuses for the Thai reactionary authorities and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to intervene militarily in Laos, saying that "since the signs of communist interference in Laos are so clear, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization should study the situation in Laos in order to take the necessary measures to stop communist aggression against the treaty area."

Thai Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman also clamored on the 12th that the situation in Laos seemed very complicated and could potentially escalate into an "international event." Thanat revealed that he had discussed the situation in Laos with Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat for several hours on the 11th, and the conclusion was that "Thailand must continue to implement vigilance."

According to the Associated Press, Sarit believes that the United States should recognize the importance of the Laotian crisis and take swift action.

On the 11th, Nai Pote Sarasin, Secretary-General of the Southeast Asia aggressive group, also declared to the press that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization attaches great importance to the development of the Laotian situation. He said that the current "free world" countries are also concerned about the situation in Laos.

According to a United Press International dispatch from Bangkok on the 13th, "Some people in Thailand expect the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to take swift action and march into Laos."

According to reports, Philippine Defense Minister Santos, another member of the Southeast Asia aggressive group, recently also clamored wildly in Tokyo that the Philippines is prepared to fulfill its responsibilities under the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and will provide troops for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to intervene in Laos if necessary.

The news said that Admiral Harry D. Felt, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet in South Korea, may fly to Manila or Bangkok to discuss the situation in Laos with officials from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

    声明说，一切事实证明，所谓“革命委员会”的阴谋是：分裂国土，推翻富马政府，破坏民族和睦和国家统一，扩大内战，继续残暴地迫害、屠杀人民和进行破坏活动，阻挠老挝走向真正的和平中立道路，密切地勾结泰国和南越的反动派，把老挝出卖给美帝国主义，从而把老挝变成它们的新型殖民地和战争基地。这对我们的祖国和人民是一种严重的威胁，它不仅促使老挝局势更加紧张，而且威胁了印度支那和东南亚的和平。
    声明说，“当祖国正陷于水深火热的时候，为了祖国的生存，为了老挝的领土完整，老挝爱国战线党恳切地呼吁全国同胞，包括各民族、各阶层、各政党和所有爱国、爱和平的人们，一致起来反对美帝国主义的干涉和侵略，反对富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛乱集团的‘革命委员会’，反对这个集团的一切叛国殃民和分裂国土的行为，拥护合法的富马政府和以贡勒大尉为首的政变委员会保卫祖国、保卫宗教、保卫国王和宪法以及和平中立、民族和睦、统一国家等政策。”

    声明说，“如果王国军队的任何官兵不肯响应富马政府和以贡勒大尉为首的政变委员会的号召，顽固地跟随富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛乱集团来与人民为敌，那么，人民和人民武装力量将要坚决地把他们消灭。”
    声明说，老挝爱国战线党号召王国军队全体官兵和人民一起打倒富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛乱集团和反对美帝国主义的干涉”。
    声明最后说，“老挝人民的正义斗争一定会取得胜利！美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛乱集团的黑暗阴谋一定会遭到完全的失败！”
    新华社河内14日电　据寮国战斗部队电台13日广播：老挝各地人民继续举行集会和通过建议书，支持富马政府和政变委员会宣布的和平、中立和民族和睦的政策。
    这家电台说，从8月23日到30日，甘蒙省先后约有五千人集会，通过了写给国王、富马亲王、新政府和国会的一百四十多份建议书。这些建议书都呼吁国王促使新政府实行和平中立政策和实现民族和睦；呼吁政府、国会和富马亲王严正履行曾经宣布的政策；支持政变委员会主席贡勒大尉的声明；反对富米·诺萨万叛国分子参加富马政府。
    这家电台同一天还报道说，同人民武装力量配合起来的老挝南部地区和沿第十三号公路一带的人民群众，正在破坏一些公路桥梁，以反对富米·诺萨万集团派军队进行“扫荡”、迫害人民和进攻万象。
    新华社14日讯　曼谷消息：泰国乃沙立反动集团叫嚣由美国控制的东南亚条约组织采取行动，干预老挝的内政。
    据“暹罗群众报”12日报道，泰国陆军参谋长、东南亚条约组织军事顾问苏拉吉11日向报界发表谈话时，竟然将富米·诺萨万和文翁·纳占巴塞联合发动的叛乱，称为“革命”。他叫嚷说：“如果富马政府不承认这个革命，因而引起了军事冲突，那么，富马政府就应当对发生的事件负责”。
    苏拉吉为泰国反动当局和东南亚条约组织武装干涉老挝制造借口，说什么“既然共产党干涉老挝的迹象已如此清楚，东南亚条约组织就应当研究老挝局势，以便采取必要的措施，来制止共产党对条约地区的侵略”。
    泰国外交部长乃他纳·科曼12日也叫嚣说，老挝的局势似乎很复杂，而且有可能扩大成为“国际事件”。乃他纳透露，他曾于11日同泰国总理乃沙立就老挝局势商谈了数小时，得出的结果是，“泰国必须继续实施戒备”。
    据美联社报道，乃沙立认为，美国应当认识到老挝危机的重要性，并迅速采取行动。
    11日，东南亚侵略集团秘书长乃朴·沙拉信也向报界宣称，东南亚条约组织非常重视老挝局势的发展。他说，目前“自由世界”各国也很关怀老挝的局势。
    据合众国际社13日从曼谷发出的一则消息透露，“泰国有人预料，东南亚条约组织或将采取迅速行动，向老挝进军。”
    据报道，东南亚侵略集团的另一个成员国菲律宾的国防部长桑托斯最近在东京也狂妄地叫嚣说，菲律宾正准备履行它在东南亚条约组织中所负的责任，在必要时将以军队供东南亚条约组织作干涉老挝之用。
    消息说，现在南朝鲜的太平洋美军司令费耳特可能飞往马尼拉或曼谷，同东南亚条约组织的官员讨论老挝局势。
