Forever Be With the Masses to Build a New Socialist Countryside
Zhou Wancang Leads the People of Jilunzhai to Get Rid of Poverty and Move Towards Prosperity

	Commune Party Secretary Zhou Wancang treats Jilunzhai as his own home, and the members here treat Zhou Wancang as their own family. One year, the higher authorities wanted to transfer Zhou Wancang to work in the county party committee, but he wrote a letter to a leading comrade requesting: I am reluctant to leave the masses of Jilunzhai; let me work with them to build Jilunzhai into a new socialist countryside. Therefore, although he was appointed as the deputy director of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Woyang County Committee several years ago, he has never left Jilunzhai. This inseparable relationship between Zhou Wancang and the masses of Jilunzhai has a history of ten years, and this relationship has deepened step by step with the changes in Jilunzhai.

	Ten years ago—in 1950, Zhou Wancang was still a twenty-one-year-old youth. The higher authorities gave him a task to lead the masses in Jilunzhai to carry out production and disaster relief. At that time, the county party committee leader who assigned him the task asked him: Are you afraid of hardship? Zhou Wancang replied: No fear! No matter how hard it is, it is still not as hard as when I was a child begging for food and working as a farmhand for the landlord.

	Jilunzhai is a low-lying alkaline land that is “flooded by a toad's urine and dried to the bottom of the lake if it doesn't rain for three days.” Before liberation, it suffered continuous disasters, and the farmers of Jilunzhai were always in a state of “only eating bran and vegetables without seeing grain, and starving to death if they don't eat bran and vegetables.” In addition, due to the landlord's cruel exploitation and the plunder of the Kuomintang reactionaries, in 1948, 228 households and 667 people fled from here to beg for food, 22 people starved to death outside, and 18 households sold their children to make a living.

	Zhou Wancang came to this extremely poor place that had just been liberated. When he saw the impoverished farmers, he couldn't even eat his meal that day. He visited some local old residents overnight and made up his mind to settle down here. He would not leave Jilunzhai until he completed the task assigned by the Party and changed the poor conditions together with the masses.

	Rely on the Collective, Rely on the Masses

	After entering Jilunzhai, Zhou Wancang thought this way: To complete the task assigned by the Party, we must rely on the masses, and we must organize the masses. Only with the strength of the collective can we get rid of poverty. Therefore, when the disaster relief work had just begun, a few middle peasants requested that the disaster relief funds allocated by the government be distributed to each household for their own disposal. Zhou Wancang firmly opposed this view. He said: “If the funds are distributed to each household, they will be sitting idle and consuming their capital. In the end, it will still be disaster relief. If the funds are used as production funds and organized for production, they will eat interest without consuming capital, and there will be something from nothing.” The vast majority of poor peasants supported his proposal. Therefore, he mobilized the masses to organize sideline production mutual aid teams, and distributed the relief funds to the teams to eat interest and preserve capital. Soon, sideline production in the teams was in full swing. At this time, a few people proposed the opinion of "how much red is earned, how much red is divided". With the support of the poor and lower-middle peasants, Zhou Wancang implemented the "three-seven" profit distribution system he proposed, that is, 30% of the sideline production surplus was collectively owned by the mutual aid team, and 70% was distributed to individuals, thereby playing a role that the masses called "tendons connected to legs, and legs connected to tendons", and economically linked the original scattered individual farmers together. The sideline production mutual aid teams organized in the summer of 1951 during disaster relief production quickly turned into year-round mutual aid teams combining agriculture and sideline occupations. All thirty-three temporary mutual aid teams in Jilunzhai Township were upgraded to year-round mutual aid teams, becoming the earliest year-round mutual aid teams in the Fuyang area of ​​Anhui Province.

	In the spring of 1952, Communist Party member Ji Mingxuan, under the specific guidance of Zhou Wancang, took the lead in establishing the first primary agricultural production cooperative. After a year of trial operation, it proved that the semi-socialist agricultural production cooperative had greater and more advantages than the mutual aid team in developing production. Therefore, the vast members around were actively asking to set up cooperatives. In the winter of 1952, the farmers of Jilunzhai Township automatically formed 22 primary cooperatives through grassroots connections.

	As the leader of the Party organization in this township, Zhou Wancang was deeply encouraged by the enthusiasm of the masses to take the socialist road. He believed that these cooperatives could be run well as long as the leadership was strengthened based on production needs, mutual assistance and cooperation, leadership backbone and other conditions. However, some right-leaning conservative comrades did not recognize some of the primary cooperatives here and instructed Zhou Wancang to examine "impulsive advancement". With the support of the vast number of members, Zhou Wancang withstood this adverse wind of anti-advancement. The members said: "Regardless of whether it is recognized or not, as long as it can increase grain production, we will continue to do it." Soon, the Party Central Committee issued the general line for the transition period, calling on farmers to take the road of collectivization. After Chairman Mao's speech on agricultural cooperation was published, the members happily said: "Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have figured out our intentions!" In the winter of 1955, the 22 primary cooperatives in Jilunzhai developed into a senior cooperative, and the number of members expanded from more than 300 households to more than 1,000 households. In this way, advanced collectivization was realized throughout the township. In the great leap forward of 1958, the Jilunzhai senior cooperative united with dozens of surrounding senior cooperatives to form the Jilunzhai People's Commune with more than 13,200 member households. From mutual aid teams, primary cooperatives, senior cooperatives to people's communes, the farmers of Jilunzhai have always held high the banner of socialism and become one of the banners of Huaibei farmers adhering to the collective road.

	Rooted Correctly, Grow Good Seedlings

	Communist Party member Zhou Wancang, who came from an employed labor background, rooted himself among the poor peasants from the first day he arrived in Jilunzhai. He often said: "Without good roots, there are no good seedlings." Over the past ten years, he has resolutely and conscientiously implemented the Party's class line in implementing every instruction of the Party and completing every major task. During his tenure as the secretary of the Jilunzhai Party branch, the poor peasant activists Ji Mingxuan, Ji Mingyin, Wang Xingzhen, etc., who were admitted to the Party successively, have always been the backbone figures in changing the poor history of Jilunzhai. Ji Mingxuan, who is now a representative of the National People's Congress, was the first activist discovered by Zhou Wancang. He has served as the leader of the first mutual aid team here from its birth, and then successively served as the director of the first primary cooperative and the first senior cooperative here. He is still the director of the People's Commune. Another party member from a poor peasant background, Ji Mingyin, together with Zhou Wancang, regardless of the opposition of those with conservative ideas, insisted on experimenting with rice planting on improved sandy alkaline land, pioneering the history of rice planting here. Poor peasant woman Wang Xingzhen has become a famous silkworm breeding "native expert" under the cultivation and support of the Party. After the Party organization and Zhou Wancang rooted themselves among the poor peasants, they received the unanimous love of their class brothers. They all voluntarily offered suggestions and contributed their wisdom to build a new socialist countryside. Seventeen old farmers, including Ji Shoukui and Ji Shoubang, have long been Zhou Wancang's voluntary "advisers." These examples have continuously encouraged Zhou Wancang, making him more determined in his belief: "As long as Communist Party members are always with the masses, there is no goal that cannot be achieved."

	Change the Land and Regulate Water, Man Conquers Nature

	The farmers of Jilunzhai have always believed that poor natural conditions are the root of poverty. Zhou Wancang vowed to be with the masses here and eradicate this root of poverty like eradicating the feudal exploitation system. Since 1951, he has led the masses to attack sandy alkaline land. He led several young people to try planting mung beans on a piece of alkaline land. As soon as the yellow buds grew out, they died of drought if it didn't rain for a day. Some old people smiled and said: "Young man, this old alkaline soil cannot grow crops. If it could grow crops, would our ancestors have left it idle?" But Zhou Wancang insisted on experimenting and planted buckwheat, but it died of drought like mung beans. At this time, Zhou Wancang did not give up and looked for experience everywhere. Once, he passed by the house of old farmer Ji Dayu and saw that he had planted a small piece of melon in the alkaline land. The melons were very large, and the few cotton plants growing in the melon field were also very lush. Zhou Wancang was very happy when he saw it and thought it was a good example of transforming alkaline land. He asked Ji Dayu how this piece of land was planted? Ji Dayu said to him: "This piece of land of mine was turned over. There is black soil under the alkaline soil, and there is also yellow soil. If you turn up the black soil and yellow soil, you can grow crops." Zhou Wancang was overjoyed and immediately mobilized more than 20 young people to visit Ji Dayu's melon field and took the lead in turning over the soil. In the spring of 1952, they planted cotton on the newly opened three acres of virgin land, and the result was 57 catties of seed cotton per mu. Although the yield was not high, the growth of cotton in alkaline land was an unprecedented miracle in the history of Jilunzhai. The appearance of three acres of cotton on sandy alkaline land greatly increased the confidence and enthusiasm of the masses in transforming alkaline wasteland. Zhou Wancang struck while the iron was hot and called on everyone to offer suggestions and ideas to make the transformation faster and better. As a result, a vigorous movement to transform alkaline wasteland was launched in Jilunzhai. After several years of hard work, by 1955, 2,800 mu of alkaline wasteland had been dressed in new clothes, growing cotton, sweet potatoes and other crops.

	On the basis of the victory in transforming sandy alkaline land, Zhou Wancang led the masses to advance victoriously and, together with Communist Party member Ji Mingyin, successfully tried planting rice in 1953 on the "Lufeng soil" land, which had always been considered unable to grow rice, inspiring the enthusiasm of the masses to seize high yields. The members said: "To produce more grain, we must plant more high-yield crops!"

	In order to overcome drought and flood disasters, since the winter of 1954, the Jilunzhai Party organization, according to the instructions of the higher-level Party committee, has regarded water conservancy construction as an important task. Zhou Wancang personally served as the commander of the water conservancy project. He ate, lived, worked and discussed with the migrant workers, innovated construction tools and construction methods, and broke through the "five major passes" of sandy conglomerate, sticky mud, quicksand, flash floods, and frozen ice. By 1958, Jilunzhai had initially realized river networkization. Relying on this man-made "Milky Way," they overcame the hundred-day drought in 1959 and the heavy rain of 170 centimeters this year, realizing the ideal of drought and flood protection for bumper harvests that the local people have longed for for many years.

	Grain First, All Industries Flourish

	In the long-term leadership of the masses in Jilunzhai to develop production, Zhou Wancang deeply realized: "Without grain, nothing can be mobilized." Therefore, he paid great attention to the development of grain production. He also summarized the advanced experience created by the masses in "using land to nourish land" and "using grain to nourish grain" through personal participation in production. "Using land to nourish land" is to comprehensively utilize agricultural crops and return the straw of various crops to the fields as fertilizer; "Using grain to nourish grain" mainly uses reasonable intercropping and intercropping to give play to the mutual promotion of crops. Due to the adoption of various methods, adapting to local conditions, and conscientiously implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, the Jilunzhai Commune has implemented the grain production targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program eight years ahead of schedule.

	With grain as the key link, all industries have been brought up. Under the leadership of Zhou Wancang, the members of the Jilunzhai Commune have mastered the laws of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and directly promoted agriculture. They cleverly used diversified operations to ensure the increase in agricultural production. For example, using cotton, sesame, and various melons, fruits, and flowers to raise bees, and using bee pollination to increase grain production; using ponds to raise fish, using fish to fertilize ponds, using ponds to accumulate fertilizer, and using fertilizer to increase grain production; afforestation on both sides of the river network, using forests to raise pigs, using pigs to accumulate fertilizer, and using fertilizer to increase grain production, etc. They also used diversified operations to accumulate funds for agriculture and equip agriculture. The Jilunzhai Commune has used the income from diversified operations to purchase three tractors and 280 horsepower of irrigation machinery. These practices have guaranteed the production of Jilunzhai and truly achieved "grasping the key link to bring along everything else," and a situation of one industry (agriculture) flourishing and all industries prospering has emerged. Last year alone, it sold more than 14 million catties of grain, 120,000 catties of oil, more than 40,000 catties of cotton, more than 1,000 pigs, and a large number of chickens, ducks, fish, silk, and fruits to the state. The members happily sang: "Jilunzhai is a good place, the granaries are full of grain, the ponds are full of fish, cattle and horses are in groups, trees are in rows, tractors are used for farming, there is a river network for irrigation, rice grows in sandy alkaline land, and flowers and fruits are fragrant all year round. Thank Chairman Mao, thank the Communist Party!"

    永远和群众在一起建设新农村
    周万仓带领纪伦寨人民摆脱穷困走向富裕
    公社党委书记周万仓把纪伦寨当成自己的家，这里的社员把周万仓当亲人一样看待。有一年，上级要调周万仓到县委去工作，他写信给一位领导同志请求说：我舍不得离开纪伦寨的群众，让我和他们在一起把纪伦寨建设成为一个新农村吧。因此，他虽然好几年以前就被任命为中共涡阳县委农村工作部的副部长，可是却一直没有离开过纪伦寨。周万仓和纪伦寨的群众这种鱼水不可分的关系，已经有十年的历史了，随着纪伦寨的变化，这种关系一步比一步深。
    十年前——1950年，周万仓还是一个二十一岁的青年，上级交给他一个任务，到纪伦寨领导群众搞生产救灾。当时向他交代任务的县委领导同志问他：你怕不怕苦？周万仓回答说：不怕！再苦，也苦不过我小时候讨饭和给地主当长工。
    纪伦寨是个“蛤蟆撒尿淹到庄户，三天不下雨旱到湖底”的洼湖碱地，解放前连续遭灾，纪伦寨的农民一直处在“光吃糠菜不见粮，不吃糠菜饿断肠”的境地。加上地主的残酷剥削和国民党反动派统治的掠刮，1948年，从这里逃荒出去要饭的就有二百二十八户、六百六十七人，饿死在外的有二十二人，为糊口而出卖儿女的十八户。
    周万仓来到这刚解放不久的极端贫困的地方，看到一贫如洗的农民，当天他连饭也吃不下去，连夜访问了当地一些老居户，下定决心，要在这里落户，不完成党交给的任务，不和群众一起改变穷困的面貌，不离开纪伦寨。
    依靠集体　依靠群众
    周万仓进入纪伦寨以后，就这样想，要完成党交给的任务，必须依靠群众，必须把群众组织起来，用集体的力量才能摆脱贫困。因此，当救灾工作刚开始，有少数中农要求把政府拨给的救济粮款发到户，由各户自己支配，周万仓坚决反对这种意见。他说：“把粮款发给各户，坐吃山空，到头来还是救灾，把粮款作为生产基金，组织起来搞生产，吃利不吃本，就会由无变有。”绝大多数贫农都支持他这个主张。于是，他就发动群众组织副业生产互助组，把救济粮款发到组，吃利保本。不久组里副业生产就搞得热火朝天。这时候少数人又提出“赚多少红，分多少红”的意见。周万仓在贫农和下中农的支持下，实行了他提出的“三七”分红制度，即将副业生产盈余的30％作为互助组集体所有，70％分红给个人，从而起了群众称之谓“筋连腿、腿连筋”的作用，从经济上把原来分散的个体农户联结起来了。1951年夏天救灾生产中组织起来的副业生产互助组，很快都变成农副业结合的常年互助组。纪伦寨乡的三十三个临时互助组全部提高为常年互助组，成为安徽阜阳地区最早出现的常年互助组。
    1952年春天，共产党员纪明选在周万仓具体指导下，带头办起第一个初级农业生产合作社，经过一年的试办，证明半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社，在发展生产上比互助组具有更大更多的优越性。因此，周围广大组员都积极要求办社。1952年冬天，纪伦寨乡的农民自动串连办起了二十二个初级社。
    作为这个乡的党组织的领导人周万仓，深深为群众这种要求走社会主义道路的热情所鼓舞，他认为根据生产需要，互助合作的基础，领导骨干等条件，只要加强领导，这些合作社是能够办得好的。可是，有些右倾保守的同志却不承认这里的一部分初级社，并且指令周万仓检讨“急躁冒进”。周万仓在广大社员的支持下，顶住了这股反冒进的歪风。社员们说：“不管承认不承认，只要能增产粮食就办下去。”不久，党中央颁布了过渡时期的总路线，号召农民走合作化的道路，毛主席关于农业合作化问题的讲话发表以后，社员们高兴地说：“还是毛主席和党中央摸透了咱们的心意！”1955年冬，纪伦寨的二十二个初级社发展成一个高级社，社员从三百多户扩大为一千多户，这样就在全乡范围内实现了高级合作化。1958年大跃进声中，纪伦寨高级社又联合周围几十个高级社，组成了一万三千二百多户社员的纪伦寨人民公社。从互助组、初级社、高级社到人民公社，纪伦寨的农民一直高举社会主义的大旗，成为淮北农民坚持集体道路的旗帜之一。
      扎正根　长好苗
    雇工出身的共产党员周万仓，从到纪伦寨第一天起，就把自己的根子扎到贫农当中。他常说：“无好根，没好苗”。十年来，他在贯彻党的每一项指示，完成每一个重大任务的时候，都坚决认真地执行党的阶级路线。在他担任纪伦寨党支部书记期间，先后吸收入党的贫农积极分子纪明选、纪明银、王兴贞等，始终是改变纪伦寨贫困历史的中坚人物。今天已经是全国人民代表大会代表的纪明选，是周万仓最早发现的积极分子，他从这里诞生第一个互助组起，就担任组长，以后接连担任这儿第一个初级社、第一个高级社的社长，现在还是人民公社的社长。另一个贫农出身的党员纪明银，和周万仓一起，不顾那些有保守思想人们的反对，坚持在经过改良的砂碱地上试验种稻，开辟了这里的种稻历史。贫农妇女王兴贞，在党的培养和支持下，已经成为有名的养蚕“土专家”。党的组织和周万仓在贫农中间扎根以后，受到了阶级兄弟的一致爱戴，他们都主动向党献计献策，把自己的智慧贡献出来建设新农村。纪守魁、纪守邦等十七位老农，长期是周万仓的义务“参谋”。这些事例不断地鼓舞着周万仓，使他更坚定了这样的信念：“共产党员只要永远和群众在一起，就没有实现不了的目标。”
    改地调水　人胜自然
    纪伦寨的农民，一向认为自然条件不好，是一条穷根。周万仓发誓要和这里的群众在一起，像铲除封建剥削制度一样，拔掉这一条穷根。从1951年起，他就领导群众向砂碱地进攻。他带领几个青年在一块碱地上试着种了绿豆，刚生出黄芽，一天不下雨，就旱死了。一些老年人见了都笑着说：“小伙子，这老碱土不能长庄稼，若是能种庄稼，俺们老辈人还会让它闲着？”可是周万仓坚持试验，又种上了荞麦，结果和绿豆一样旱死了。这时，周万仓还不罢休，到处找经验。有一次，他路过老农纪大禹的屋前，见他在碱地当中种了一小块瓜，结的瓜很大，瓜地里长的几棵棉花也很旺盛。周万仓一见很高兴，觉得是改造碱地的一个好样子。便问纪大禹这块地是怎么种的？纪大禹对他说：“我这块地是翻起来的，碱土下面有黑土，也有黄土，把黑土和黄土翻上来，就能长庄稼。”周万仓如获真宝，立即动员了二十多个青年到纪大禹的瓜地里参观，并且带头动手翻土。1952年春天他们在新开的三亩处女地种上了棉花，结果亩产籽棉五十七斤。产量虽然不算高，但是碱地长出棉花，却是纪伦寨历史上没有过的奇迹。砂碱地上出现三亩棉花，大大提高了群众改造碱荒地的信心和积极性。周万仓趁热打铁，号召大家献计献策，要改得快、改得好。于是，一个轰轰烈烈的改造碱荒地的运动，便在纪伦寨展开了。经过几年苦战，到1955年，二千八百亩碱荒地都换上了新装，生长了棉花、红薯等作物。
    在改造砂碱地胜利的基础上，周万仓又领导群众乘胜前进，和共产党员纪明银一起，1953年在一向被人们认为不能生长水稻的“露风土”地上，试种水稻成功，激发了群众夺取高产的热情，社员们说：“要多打粮，非多种高产作物不可！”
    为了战胜旱、洪灾害，从1954年冬季起，纪伦寨党组织根据上级党委的指示，就把水利建设作为一项重要任务。周万仓亲自担任水利工程指挥员。他和民工同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，革新施工工具和施工方法，攻破了砂矼、粘泥、流砂、暴水、冻冰“五大关”，到1958年纪伦寨就初步实现了河网化。依靠这人造的“银河”，战胜了1959年的百日大旱和今年连降一百七十厘米的大雨，实现了当地群众多少年所向往的旱、涝保丰收的理想。
    粮食挂帅　百业兴旺
    周万仓在长期领导纪伦寨群众发展生产中，深深地体会到：“没有粮食，什么都调动不开”。因而非常注意发展粮食生产，他还通过亲自参加生产，总结出群众创造的“以田养田”、“以粮养粮”的先进经验。“以田养田”就是对农作物实行综合利用，将各种作物的秸秆还田成肥；“以粮养粮”，主要是利用合理的间作、套作，发挥作物之间互相促进的作用。由于采用各种办法，因地制宜，认真地贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，纪伦寨公社已经提前八年实行了全国农业发展纲要规定的粮食生产指标。
    粮食挂了帅，把各业生产带了起来。纪伦寨公社的社员们在周万仓的带头钻研下，掌握了林、牧、副、渔，直接促进农业的规律，巧妙地利用多种经营来保证农业的增产。如以棉花、芝麻和各种瓜果花养蜂，以蜂传粉增粮；以塘养鱼，以鱼肥塘，以塘积肥，以肥增粮；在河网两旁造林，以林养猪，以猪积肥，以肥增粮等等。还利用多种经营，为农业积累资金，装备农业。纪伦寨公社，已经利用多种经营的收入购买了三部拖拉机和二百八十匹马力的灌溉机械。这些作法，保证了纪伦寨的生产，真正做到了“纲举目张”，出现了一业（农业）兴、百业旺的局面。去年一年就交售给国家一千四百多万斤粮食、十二万斤油料、四万多斤棉花、一千多头猪，以及大量鸡、鸭、鱼、蚕丝和水果等。社员们高兴地唱道：“纪伦寨是个好地方，粮满囤，鱼满塘，牛马成群，树成行，种地用上拖拉机，灌溉有河网，砂碱地里长大米，一年四季花果香，感谢毛主席，感谢共产党！”
