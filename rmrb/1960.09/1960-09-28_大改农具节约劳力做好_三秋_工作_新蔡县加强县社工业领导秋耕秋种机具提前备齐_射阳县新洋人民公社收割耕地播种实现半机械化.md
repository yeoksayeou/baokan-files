Greatly Improve Farm Tools to Save Labor and Do a Good Job in "Sanqiu" Work
　  Xincai County Strengthens County and Commune Industrial Leadership; Autumn Cultivation and Planting Machinery Prepared in Advance
　  Xinyang People's Commune in Sheyang County Achieves Semi-Mechanization of Harvesting, Cultivation, and Planting

    This newspaper reports that Xincai County, Henan Province, with its eleven county and commune machinery factories and two hundred and thirty-seven farm tool repair shops, has prepared more than 130,000 pieces of improved farm tools and semi-mechanized farm tools such as deep plows, improved harrows, seeders, and close-planting drills, according to the requirements of the county's 1.15 million mu of autumn sowing tasks, basically meeting the needs of wheat planting.

    This county is relatively remote. Although the county and communes have established many factories, the equipment is simple and the technical force is insufficient. The whole county is a plain and lacks raw materials such as steel and coal needed for manufacturing machines. However, at present, there are a large number of iron and wood farm tools in the countryside. As long as they are slightly reformed, production efficiency can be greatly improved and labor and animal power can be saved. The county party committee decided that county and commune industries should support agricultural technology transformation, focusing on the large-scale development of improved farm tools and semi-mechanized farm tools, and gradually develop towards the manufacture of agricultural machinery.

    The county party committee, according to the needs of agricultural production and seasonal characteristics, carried out a comprehensive plan and put forward specific goals. The county, communes, and brigades implemented the system of secretaries living in factories and committee members taking charge of workshops, strengthening leadership at all levels and concentrating superior forces to carry out large-scale shock campaigns. Adopt the method of solving one link and then grasping another to realize the improvement of farm tools and semi-mechanization in a planned and focused manner.

    The key to large-scale improvement of farm tools lies in popularizing their use. The county party committee adopted the method of improving, manufacturing, and popularizing at the same time, and held an advanced farm tool evaluation conference every month. This method has now become regularized and systematized. Through evaluation and appraisal, a batch of tools are finalized, manufactured, and used. From January to August, the county improved and manufactured a total of 841 kinds of farm tools, more than 240,000 pieces. After eight evaluations, 382 types have been finalized and promoted throughout the county, more than 150,000 pieces. The goal of reforming one item and promoting it in a wide area, blooming in one place and bearing fruit everywhere is achieved. After the county's "Sanqiu" tool evaluation meeting in mid-August, 1,328 "79" light and convenient deep plows and more than 3,000 other farm tools were promoted in ten days. Due to the large-scale use of improved farm tools and semi-mechanized farm tools, the county saved more than 165,000 labor forces and more than 53,000 animal powers in eight months. This summer, wheat production increased by more than 30% in all areas where deep cultivation and close planting tools were used.

    Holding evaluation meetings every month is a successful experience in promoting advanced farm tools, and it is also an effective method to gradually improve advanced farm tools. Many farm tools have reached the standards of semi-mechanization and even mechanization after multiple improvements and innovations. For example, the nine-row seeder manufactured by the Guanjin Commune Machinery Factory was gradually modified and manufactured on the basis of the old drill. This drill is not only fully suitable for close planting requirements, but also can be pulled by animal or mechanical power, and has been praised by the Ministry of Agricultural Machinery. Through monthly evaluations, the enthusiasm and creativity of the majority of employees have been further stimulated. They boldly innovated and worked hard to make various old-fashioned farm tools reborn and change their original appearance. For example, the six-row automatic spring close-planting drill has been finalized and promoted after seven reforms. Two people and one animal can plant 60 mu of wheat a day, increasing work efficiency by more than five times compared to the original.

    This newspaper Yancheng, 27th -- The Xinyang Commune in Sheyang County, Jiangsu Province, has basically achieved semi-mechanization in the main processes of "Sanqiu," such as harvesting, threshing, land preparation, opening ridges, compacting, sowing, and covering soil, setting up a red banner in Jiangsu Province's tool reform.

    Xinyang Commune has a large land area and a small population, and the foundation for tool reform is relatively good. In the main processes of spring sowing and summer harvesting and planting, some harvesters were used, and improved farm tools such as threshers, land preparation machines, and seeders were widely used; in field management, improved farm tools such as multi-head sprayers, fertilizer applicators, and three-tooth cultivators were widely used. Therefore, spring sowing saved 60% of labor, summer harvesting and planting saved 58% of labor, and cotton field management saved 41.3% of labor.

    Since the beginning of autumn, the commune party committee has further adopted the method of "four combinations" of cadres, workers, peasants, and technicians, and on the basis of the original semi-mechanized improved farm tools, vigorously repaired, modified, and created a total of 15 types of semi-mechanized improved farm tools for harvesting, threshing, land preparation, and sowing, more than 1,040 pieces. Now, the rice-wheat combine harvester and the improved stone roller thresher are playing their power in the autumn harvest, and autumn planting tools are basically ready. Zhaofeng Brigade tested the use of semi-mechanized harvesters to harvest rice in the middle of the season. One cow pulled, three people operated, and one harvester harvested 11 mu of rice a day. The entire commune harvested more than 18,000 mu of corn, all using stone roller machines equipped with ball bearings for threshing, which was more than twice as fast as in previous years. 1,800 man-days and cattle-days were saved, and more than 12,000 mu of autumn fields were cultivated and harrowed. In order to adapt to the needs of intercropping wheat in cotton fields, the commune also made use of three-tooth cultivators to modify them into small and exquisite "double-plate" and "rolling dragon" single-row seeders, which are pulled by cattle power. The three processes of cultivation, sowing, and soil covering are completed together, which can increase work efficiency by more than ten times compared to manual sowing. This year, more than 40,000 mu of cotton fields in the commune will generally use "double-plate" and "rolling dragon" cotton-wheat intercropping machines for sowing. Qianjin Brigade also successfully created a land preparation machine that completes the three processes of breaking soil, leveling the ground, and opening ridges at the same time. It is pulled by one cow, operated by two people, and can prepare 80 mu of land a day. At present, the commune has repaired nearly 30 land preparation machines, and the autumn planting of more than 30,000 mu of dry grain land will all use land preparation machines. Following the birth of the land preparation machine, the commune also created, modified, and imitated stone roller threshers, harvesters, and "seven clear" machines that complete the seven processes of breaking soil, leveling the ground, clearing ridges, opening rows, sowing seeds, covering soil, and compacting. This has made it possible to realize semi-mechanization of manual operations in major processes such as harvesting and planting.

    In the tool reform movement, Xinyang Commune made full use of the advantageous conditions of having a large number of livestock. According to the specific conditions such as the size of the fields, the types of crops, and the cultivation system, they created and modified a large number of various semi-mechanized improved farm tools mainly pulled by animal power. For example, during the spring sowing and summer planting period, they made animal-powered single-row, double-row, and even six-row seeders according to the size of the fields and the requirements of single planting and intercropping, which are suitable for both continuous planting and small-plot operation; suitable for intercropping and intercropping, and also suitable for sowing different crops such as cotton, corn, and soybeans.

　　大改农具节约劳力做好“三秋”工作
　  新蔡县加强县社工业领导秋耕秋种机具提前备齐
　  射阳县新洋人民公社收割耕地播种实现半机械化
    本报讯　河南新蔡县十一个县、社机械厂和二百三十七个农具修配厂，根据全县一百一十五万亩秋播任务的要求，已经准备好深耕犁、改良耙、播种机、密植耧等各种改良农具和半机械化农具十三万多件，基本上满足了种麦需要。
    这个县比较偏僻，县、社虽然建立了许多工厂，但设备简陋，技术力量不足；全县都是平原，缺乏制造机器所需要的钢铁、煤炭等原料材料。但是，目前农村有大量的铁木农具，只要稍加改革，就能大大提高生产效率，节约劳动力、畜力。县委决定县、社工业支援农业技术改造，以大搞改良农具和半机械化农具为主，逐步地向制造农业机械方向发展。
    县委根据农业生产需要和季节特点，进行了全面规划，提出具体奋斗目标。县、社、大队，实行书记住厂，委员包车间，层层加强领导，集中优势兵力，大搞突击运动。采取解决一环再抓一环的办法，有步骤有重点地实现改良农具和半机械化。
    大搞改良农具的关键在于推广使用，县委采取边改良、边制造、边推广的办法，全县每月举行一次先进农具评比大会。这个办法现在已经经常化、制度化。通过评比、鉴定，达到定型一批、制造一批，使用一批。1至8月份，全县共改良、制造农具八百四十一种，二十四万多件。经过八次评比，已经在全县定型、推广三百八十二种，十五万多件。达到改革一件，推广一片，一处开花，处处结果的目的。在8月中旬，全县“三秋”工具评比会议结束后，十天推广“七九”轻便深耕犁一千三百二十八部，其他农具三千多件。全县由于大量使用了改良农具和半机械化农具，八个月内共节省劳动力十六万五千多个，畜力五万三千多头。今年夏季小麦，凡是使用深耕密植工具的，增产都在三成以上。
    月月举行评比会议，是推广先进农具的成功经验，而且也是逐步提高先进农具的有效方法。有许多农具经过多次改良、革新，已经达到半机械化，甚至机械化的标准。如关津公社机械厂制造的九行播种机，就是在旧耧的基础上逐步改制成功的。这种耧不仅完全适合密植要求，而且畜力、动力都可以牵引，受到农业机械部的表扬。通过月月评比，进一步激发了广大职工的积极性和创造性。他们大胆革新，刻苦钻研，使多种旧式农具脱胎换骨，改变原来面貌。如六行自动弹簧密植耧，经过七次改革，已经定型、推广，两人一畜，一天可播种小麦六十亩，比原来提高工效五倍以上。
    本报盐城27日电　江苏省射阳县新洋公社在收割、脱粒、整地、开墒、压实、播种、盖土等“三秋”主要工序的操作基本上实现了半机械化，在江苏省工具改革中树立了一面红旗。 　 新洋公社地多人少，工具改革的基础比较好。在春播和夏收夏种的主要工序上，部分使用了收割机，普遍使用了脱粒机、整地机、播种机等改良农具；在田间管理上，普遍使用了多头喷雾器、追肥器、三齿耘锄等改良农具。因此，春播就节约了60％的劳力，夏收夏种节约了58％劳力，棉田管理节约了41.3％劳力。
    入秋以来，公社党委进一步采取干部、工人、农民、技术员“四结合”的办法，在原有半机械化改良农具的基础上，大力整修、改制、创制了收割、脱粒、整地、播种半机械化改良农具共十五种，一千零四十多件。现在，稻麦两用收割机和改良的石磙脱粒机，正在秋收中发挥威力，秋种工具已基本准备就绪。兆丰大队在收割中稻中试用半机械化收割机割稻，一头牛拉，三人操作，一台收割机一天割稻十一亩。全社收割了一万八千多亩玉米，都是使用装有滚珠轴承的石磙机脱粒，进度比往年快一倍以上。节省了一千八百多个人工和牛工，多耕耖了秋田一万二千多亩。为了适应棉田套种麦子的需要，公社又因作物制宜地利用三齿耘锄改装成小巧玲珑的“双板式”、“滚龙式”的单行播种机，以牛力牵引，耕地、播种、盖土三道工序一起完成，可比人工播种提高工效十倍多。今年全社四万多亩棉田都要普遍使用
  “双板式”和“滚龙式”棉麦套种机播种。前进大队还创造成功一台碎土、平地、开墒三道工序一起完成的整地机，用一头牛牵引，二人操作，一天整地八十亩。目前，全社已整修好整地机近三十台，三万多亩旱谷地的秋种将全部使用整地机整地。继整地机诞生后，全社又创制、改制、仿制成功石磙脱粒机、收割机，以及碎土，平地、清墒、开行、撒种、盖土、压实七道工序一起完成的“七清”机。这样就使收、种等主要工序上，实现了手工操作半机械化。
    新洋公社在工具改革运动中，充分利用畜力多的有利条件。他们根据田块大小，作物种类、耕作制度等具体情况，大量创制和改制了以畜力牵引为主的各种半机械化改良农具。例如春播和夏种期间，他们根据田块大小和单种、间种的要求，制成畜力牵引单行、双行以至六行的播种机，既适于连片种植，又便于小块田操作；既适于间种套作，又适用棉花、玉米、大豆等不同作物的播种。
