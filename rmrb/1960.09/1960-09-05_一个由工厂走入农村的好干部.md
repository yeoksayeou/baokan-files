A Good Cadre Who Went from the Factory to the Countryside
By our reporter Chen Jian

Comrade Xu Xing, a Communist Party member from a worker background, has been working as the First Secretary of the Party Committee of the Dayugou People's Commune in Gongxian County, Henan Province, for more than a year. He works hard, goes deep into the grassroots, is conscientious and earnest, makes close friends among the commune members, and leads the masses to transform a poor mountainous commune that used to be short of grain every year into a prosperous commune with consecutive bumper harvests.

Xu Xing used to be a model packaging worker in a local state-owned factory in Gongxian County and was a novice in agricultural production. When the Party transferred him to work in the remote and poor Dayugou People's Commune, he was only twenty-five years old. After writing a letter of determination to the county Party committee, stating his commitment to settle in the mountains for a long time, he went up the mountain with a simple luggage. This luggage contained a set of Selected Works of Mao Zedong and a small diary. There was a poem in the diary: "Water conservancy surpasses Jiangnan, the land resembles a garden, production is mechanized, labor is light and convenient, granaries are full of grain, except for selling, reserve for three years." Xu Xing had not attended school, but he taught himself some culture and wrote out his ideal of building the mountainous area. At that time, the Dayugou People's Commune was a poor mountainous commune in Gongxian County. The entire commune was divided by more than one hundred and thirty large and small mountains and countless gullies. The population was scattered, with three to five households scattered on the hillsides, making working conditions very difficult.

On a rainy evening in November 1958, Xu Xing arrived at the Dayugou Commune. He had a deep conversation with the commune cadres all night, and the next morning, still carrying his small bag, he eagerly went down to the teams. He spent a month traveling all over the commune's one hundred and thirty villages. He even went to the top of "One Household on One Ridge," which even cadres who had worked here for many years had never visited. He had extensive conversations with the commune members to understand their production, living conditions, and health. In the sparsely populated "General Ridge," he discovered that poor peasant Cao Baoyu was seriously ill, so he immediately went down the mountain to invite a doctor, who cured Cao Baoyu's illness. In the first few months of his arrival in Dayugou, he made many friends in various brigades. The commune members felt that he was their confidant and often reported situations and discussed problems with him.

Comrade Xu Xing quietly, closely relied on the masses, and consulted with them on everything. The masses said that he worked steadily, always so conscientious, earnest, and meticulous. This work style enabled him to quickly grasp two major problems that the whole commune needed to solve: one was water, and the other was fertilizer and its transportation. Here, not to mention using water to irrigate the land, even drinking water was difficult for the commune members. When he saw that the commune members could only carry a load of manure weighing dozens of kilograms from the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain in a morning, he thought: How can we talk about increasing production? He was determined to help the masses solve these problems. He and the commune's cadres and technicians stayed overnight in the deep mountains and dense forests, conducting surveys and interviews in more than one hundred mountains to find mountain springs and water sources. Wherever he went, he publicized the importance of water and fertilizer to the commune members. Afterwards, he led the commune members in a battle to seize water under extremely difficult natural conditions, digging more than five hundred and seventy mountain springs, building more than thirty river dams, and ninety-six water diversion projects, expanding the irrigated area of the commune from the original six hundred mu to thirteen thousand mu, and resisting the unprecedented drought in Henan last year.

Comrade Xu Xing became friends with an old shepherd named Fan Ping'an on the sparsely populated "Xinshan Ridge." The old farmer sincerely suggested to him: "Lao Xu, if we move the commune's sheepfolds, pigsties, and breeding houses to the mountains, accumulate and apply fertilizer on the spot, how much labor would we save in a year!" Xu Xing brought the old farmer's opinion to the commune Party committee meeting, and it was approved. The whole commune implemented a major relocation of cattle and sheep, and the whole commune could save more than 190,000 labor days for transporting manure in one quarter.

In the mountains, Xu Xing saw commune members using a kind of "coal smoke," similar to plant ash, as fuel several times. He sent someone to have this substance tested, and it was proven to be "peat fertilizer" with very good fertilizer effect. He also worked with experienced old farmers who had used it as fuel for many years to search and explore, and found two mountains with very large reserves of "peat fertilizer." Now, two open-pit peat fertilizer fields have been established on these two mountains, producing more than 220,000 kilograms of "peat fertilizer" every day. Last year, during the severe drought in Henan, Dayugou achieved a bumper harvest because it appropriately solved the problems of water, fertilizer, and labor shortage. The annual grain yield increased by 48.8%, and it sold more than 3.96 million kilograms of surplus grain to the state for the first time, reserving more than 150,000 kilograms for itself, ending the situation of relying on state subsidies every year. The commune members' confidence in building the mountainous area has been further enhanced, and they have requested to reclaim wasteland for production. Xu Xing led them to be stationed on the Yellow River滩, more than seventy miles away from Dayugou, reclaiming more than seven thousand mu of wasteland, which harvested more than 400,000 kilograms of wheat this year. Now, the several thousand mu of early autumn crops there have already eared.

The more Xu Xing's work deepened, the greater his achievements, and the more humble and cautious he became. When the Dayugou People's Commune was repeatedly rewarded by higher authorities and praised by the masses, he became even more aware of the shortcomings and problems in his work. He had a notebook with him to record various criticisms and useful suggestions from the masses. When assigning drought resistance tasks this summer, because he did not take into account the special situation that Dongling Brigade had just received a little rain, some commune members criticized him for subjectivism. He made a self-criticism on the spot and immediately consulted with the surrounding brigades, transferring more than 800 laborers to help Dongling Brigade seize the opportunity to plant more than 1,800 mu while the soil was moist.

The ideological foundation for Comrade Xu Xing's going deep among the masses, going deep into reality, working diligently, and correctly handling various problems is his tireless study of Chairman Mao's works. This young Communist Party member from a worker background is one of the most successful cadres in Gongxian County in studying Chairman Mao's works. He carries a copy of Selected Works of Mao Zedong with him and takes time to study for two hours every day, no matter how busy he is. He said: "Chairman Mao's teachings have aroused my strong desire and aspiration to change the status quo, delve into practice, and solve contradictions. If I don't discover some problems and solve several contradictions in a day, I feel that the day is tasteless." According to the requirements of the Party and the guidance of the leader's thought, Xu Xing threw himself into the masses, as if throwing himself into a vast ocean of wisdom. He always felt that he was not good enough and tirelessly learned from the masses and from books.

Now, the Dayugou People's Commune has two large trucks, forty power machines, and forty rubber-wheeled carts. Rubber-wheeled carts can pass through even the most remote mountain slopes, and the phenomenon of carrying burdens has basically been eliminated. The living standards of the commune members have greatly improved compared with two years ago, and the face of the poor mountainous area has basically changed.

    一个由工厂走入农村的好干部
    本报记者　陈健
    工人出身的共产党员徐兴同志，调到河南巩县大峪沟人民公社担任党委第一书记一年多来，工作艰苦深入，踏实认真，在社员中广交知心朋友，带领群众把一个年年缺粮的山区穷社，变成为连年丰收的富社。
    徐兴原来是巩县地方国营工厂的一个模范打包工人，对农业生产是外行。党把他调到穷乡僻壤的大峪沟人民公社工作时，他只有二十五岁。他给县委写了一份长期在山区落户的决心书后，便随身带着一个简单的行李上山了。这个行李中有一套毛泽东选集和一个小日记本。日记本上有一首诗：“水利赛江南，土地似田园，生产机械化，劳动轻又便，粮食仓仓满，除卖备三年”。徐兴没有上过学，自学点文化，但写出了自己建设山区的理想。当时的大峪沟人民公社是巩县的一个深山穷社，全社被一百三十多个大大小小的山岭和无法计算的河沟割裂开，人口居住分散，三家五户的到处散落在山坡上，工作条件十分艰苦。
    1958年11月，一个倾盆大雨的傍晚，徐兴来到了大峪沟公社。他和公社干部深谈了一夜，第二天一早，仍然背着那个小包，迫不及待的下队了。他用一个月的时间，跑遍了全社一百三十多个村庄，连在这里工作过多年的干部都没有去过的“一岭一家”的山顶，他都去了。他和社员广泛交谈，了解他们的生产、生活和健康状况。在人烟稀少的“将军岭”，他发现贫农曹保雨病得很严重，就立即下山请来医生，医好了曹保雨的病。他到大峪沟的最初几个月里，就在各大队交上了许多朋友。社员们觉得他是自己的知心人，经常向他反映情况、研究问题。
    徐兴同志不声不响，紧紧依靠群众，事事和群众商量。群众说他工作一步一个脚印，总是那么踏实、认真和细致。这种工作作风使他很快的抓住全社需要解决的两个重大问题：一个是水，一个是肥和肥的运输。在这里，不要说用水浇地，社员吃水都比较困难。当他看到社员一个早上只能把几十斤重的一担粪，从山下挑到山上，心想：这还谈什么增产？就决心帮助群众解决这些问题。他和公社的干部、技术员，夜宿深山密林，在一百多个山岭中调查访问，寻找山泉和水源。走到哪里，就向社员宣传水肥的重要性。之后，就领导全社社员，在极端艰难的自然条件下，开展了夺水大战，开挖了五百七十多个山泉，建起三十多个河坝、九十六处引水工程，使全社的水浇地由原来的六百亩扩大到一万三千亩，抗住了去年河南历史上从未有过的大旱年。
    徐兴同志在人烟稀少的“新山岭”上，和一个名叫范平安的放羊老农结成了朋友。那老农诚恳地向他建议：“老徐，要是把社里的羊圈、猪圈、饲养房都搬到山上，就地积肥、上肥，那一年该省多少劳力哇！”徐兴把老农的意见提到公社党委会议上，被通过了。全公社实行牛、羊大搬家，一个季度全社就可以节约运粪劳动日十九万多个。
    在山里，徐兴好几次看到社员用一种叫“煤熏”的类似草木灰的东西做燃料，他派人把这个东西弄去化验，证明是肥效很好的
  “草炭肥”。他又和常年用它做燃料的有经验的老农一起查找勘探，找出了两个储量很大的“草炭肥”山。现在，这两座山上建立了两个露天草炭肥场，每天出“草炭肥”二十二万多斤。去年河南大旱，大峪沟由于适当的解决了水、肥和劳力不足等问题，却得到了特大丰收，全年粮食单产增加48.8％，第一次向国家出售余粮三百九十六万多斤，自己储备十五万多斤，结束了年年要国家补助的缺粮情况。社员们建设山区的信心更加提高，纷纷要求开荒生产。徐兴就带着他们驻在离大峪沟七十多里的黄河滩上，开荒七千多亩，今年收获四十多万斤小麦，现在那里的几千亩早秋作物都已经结穗了。
    徐兴的工作越做越深入，成绩越大，自己就越是谦虚谨慎。当大峪沟人民公社一再受到上级的奖励和群众的赞扬时，他就更加清醒地想到工作中的缺点和问题。他有个随身携带的记事本，专门记下群众的各种批评意见和有益的建议。今年夏季布置抗旱任务时，因为没有照顾到董岭大队刚刚落了一点雨的特殊情况，有的社员批评他主观主义，他当场作了检讨，并立即和周围的大队协商，调来八百多名劳动力，帮助董岭大队趁墒抢种一千八百多亩。
    徐兴同志深入群众、深入实际、埋头苦干、正确处理各种问题的思想基础，是他孜孜不倦的学习了毛主席的著作。这个工人出身的年轻的共产党员，是巩县干部中学习毛主席著作比较有成效的一个。他随身带着一部毛泽东选集，每天不论工作多忙，他都要挤出时间学习两小时。他说：“毛主席的教导，激起了我变革现状、深入实践、解决矛盾的强烈要求和愿望，哪一天不发现一些问题，解决几宗矛盾，这一天便觉得没有味。”徐兴根据党的要求和领袖思想的指引，投身到群众中去，像投入到一个浩瀚的智慧的海洋里，他总是感到自己不行，孜孜不倦地向群众学习，向书本学习。
    现在，大峪沟人民公社已经拥有两部大卡车、四十部动力机械和四十部胶皮轮马车。最偏僻的山坡都能通行胶轮马车，挑担的现象已基本消灭了。社员的生活水平比两年前有了很大提高，穷山区的面貌基本上变了样。
