Timely Inspection!

    Leading cadres and relevant personnel from over 700 units in various industries in Shenyang City conducted a comprehensive and detailed inspection of the work supporting agriculture in rural areas and promptly resolved the problems discovered during the inspection, effectively improving their own work. This approach is worth promoting.

    Currently, the mass movement to support agriculture by all sectors of the country has unfolded vigorously, and the idea that developing the national economy must be based on agriculture has taken root in people's hearts. As the mass movement to support agriculture deepens, various problems will continue to emerge. For example, how can we better provide support based on agricultural technical transformation and the urgent needs of current agricultural production? How can we make more effective use of the machinery and equipment provided? How can we solve the problem of insufficient technical strength in rural areas? What other problems exist in the support work? And so on. All of these require frequent investigation and research, and finding solutions to the problems. Only by continuously conducting in-depth investigation and research in this way can the work of supporting agriculture be more planned and purposeful, more detailed, deeper, and more solid, and can the work of supporting agriculture achieve better results.

    We hope that the leading cadres of all units supporting agriculture will learn from Shenyang City's responsible spirit and solid style of conducting serious investigation and research and inspection work, and constantly improve their own work in the inspection, so as to better accomplish the great task of supporting agriculture.

    检查得及时！
    沈阳市各行各业七百多个单位的领导干部和有关人员，深入农村对支援农业工作进行了全面细致的检查，并及时解决检查中所发现的问题，切实改进自己的工作。这种做法，值得提倡。
    当前全国各行各业支援农业的群众运动已经蓬蓬勃勃地展开，发展国民经济必须以农业为基础的思想也已经深入人心。随着支援农业的群众运动深入开展，各种问题会不断出现。比如说，怎样更好地根据农业技术改造和当前农业生产的迫切需要进行支援？怎样使支援的机器设备更有效地使用起来？怎样解决农村技术力量不足的问题？支援工作中还存在着什么问题？如此等等，都需要经常地进行调查研究，并找出解决问题的方法。只有这样不断深入地进行调查研究，支援农业的工作才会更有计划性和目的性，才会越做越细，越做越深，越做越扎实，也才能使支援农业的工作发挥更好的效果。
    我们希望所有支援农业的单位的领导干部，都来学习沈阳市认真调查研究和检查工作的负责精神和扎实作风，并在检查中不断改进自己的工作，使支援农业的伟大任务完成得更好。（附图片）
