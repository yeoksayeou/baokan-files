Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 23rd: After delivering a lengthy speech at the United Nations General Assembly yesterday morning, US President Eisenhower actively engaged in extracurricular activities. He hosted a luncheon for delegations from eighteen Latin American countries, followed by meetings with Yugoslav President Tito, Ghanaian President Nkrumah, Lebanese Prime Minister Salam, and Nepalese Prime Minister Koirala.

It is reported that Eisenhower spoke with Tito for an hour, marking their first meeting. A joint statement released after the talks stated that the two sides discussed "matters of common interest, including several international issues of global concern" in a "cordial atmosphere." The statement emphasized that both sides were "pleased" with "this opportunity to exchange views together."

White House Press Secretary Hagerty later told reporters that the talks "seemed satisfactory and pleasant."

Eisenhower and Nkrumah held a 45-minute meeting on issues including the situation in the Congo. US Secretary of State Herter attended the meeting. Eisenhower also held a 45-minute meeting with Salam on issues such as Algeria and the Middle East.

At a banquet hosting delegations from eighteen Latin American countries (excluding Cuba and the Dominican Republic) attending the United Nations General Assembly, Eisenhower expressed particular "deep faith" in the "Organization of American States" as a tool for the United States to control Latin American countries. He also stated that Latin American countries are "spiritually" "linked" to the United States and that these countries should work with the United States "as a whole" to commit to "the same cause."
