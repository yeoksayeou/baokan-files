(Reported by this newspaper from Tianjin on the 14th) The Communist Party Committee of Hedong District, Tianjin, has adopted the method of collectively going deep into the production front line to lead the increase production and practice economy movement, with good results. The specific methods for collectively going deep into the production front line are: while district committee leading cadres frequently go deep into factories to participate in production and lead production separately, the district committee secretariat and standing committee often go to key enterprises to hold meetings to help factories solve key problems; the district committee's steel headquarters moved to Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant to direct the district's steel production on the spot.

Hedong District is a key industrial area in Tianjin for the production of steel and refractory materials. Tianjin's two major steel plants, No. 1 and No. 2, and Tianjin Refractory Material Plant are all in this district. In order to lead the production of these key enterprises, since the beginning of this year, the district committee secretariat has designated several secretaries to go deep into the production front line of steel plants and refractory material plants to cultivate "experimental plots." Some district committee secretaries have even moved to the steel plants to "settle down," eating, living, working, and discussing with workers, deeply and meticulously understanding the actual situation, and helping factories solve problems in a timely manner. When major problems arise in factory production, the district committee adopts the method of collectively going deep into the front line to study and solve them. For example, on July 18th, the district committee held an enlarged meeting of the district committee standing committee at the No. 2 Steel Plant, comprehensively studying the work of the No. 2 Steel Plant. While affirming the achievements, it meticulously analyzed the major key problems existing in the plant's current production. Finally, a resolution was made, determining more than 30 specific measures in terms of further strengthening production management, vigorously launching mass movements, and improving work methods. At the beginning of August, this plant further mobilized the masses extensively, carried out key problem solving competitions targeting weak links, and summarized and promoted 240 single operation experiences and 20 sets of complete experiences. Over 370 new pacesetters were established for various types of work, ensuring that each group had a pacesetter and a target for learning from and catching up with, significantly improving the plant's steel production level in August, with the steel ingot qualification rate increasing by more than 5%, and raw material consumption reduced by more than 13%, achieving the requirements of the district committee standing committee for the plant's August production. In the first five days of September, the average daily steel production level of this plant increased by more than 10% compared to late August, and the raw material consumption per ton of steel decreased by 74 kilograms.

Since the steel front launched the increase production and practice economy movement in August, the Hedong District Committee has further strengthened its leadership over steel production. The district committee established a steel headquarters and moved the district committee's steel headquarters to Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant, which has a large output, to lead the district's steel production on the spot. The steel headquarters is headed by Li Xianyuan, secretary of the district committee secretariat, and is composed of more than 100 people, including ministers and directors of various departments and offices of the district committee, directors and heads of various bureaus and offices of the district people's committee, and factory directors and party committee secretaries of some factories, forming seven working groups, including transportation, technical measures, welfare, and steel plant and refractory material plant resident groups. Each group generally has a member of the district committee standing committee or a member of the district committee in charge. The welfare group is headed by a member of the district committee standing committee and the minister of finance and trade, mobilizing employees on the district's finance and trade front to launch a massive mass movement to support steel production. The transportation group is headed by a member of the district committee and the deputy district head in charge of transportation, organizing 28 trucks and more than 380 horse-drawn carts and tricycles for the steel plant, transporting more than 538,000 tons of materials in August. By stationing the district committee's steel headquarters at the steel plant, it is possible to grasp the actual situation in a more timely manner, discover problems in a timely manner, and immediately organize forces to solve them. For example, after the production leap forward in Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant, the calcination capacity of the oil brick workshop could not keep up for a time. After the district committee's steel headquarters discovered this situation, it immediately organized state-owned Tianjin No. 3 and No. 5 Cotton Textile Plants, Tianjin Oil and Chemical Plant, Hedong District Housing Construction Company, and other units to transfer more than 300 employees to rush-build more than 40 earth dolomite calcination kilns for the No. 2 Steel Plant, quickly solving this problem.

The district committee secretariat and standing committee holding meetings in factories is a good leadership method adopted by the Hedong District Committee to adapt to the new situation of production leap forward. Since the beginning of this year, the Hedong District Committee has successively held nine enlarged meetings of the secretariat or standing committee at the grassroots level, and expanded from factories to urban people's communes and rural people's communes within the management area. This type of meeting has many benefits. First, it closely combines going deep into the front line with further strengthening the district committee's collective leadership system. In the past, generally individual secretariat secretaries or standing committee members went deep into the grassroots separately. Although this had a great effect on promoting production, sometimes when some major problems arose that required the district committee secretariat or standing committee to study and decide, they could not be handled very promptly. Now, with the district committee secretariat or standing committee collectively going deep into the front line, various problems can be handled faster and better. The district committee secretariat or standing committee holding meetings in factories can visit the site, talk to workers in advance, and, when necessary, also absorb workshop branch secretaries and others to attend meetings, so that the district committee can understand more production and ideological conditions, grasp a large amount of first-hand material, and rely on collective wisdom to study and discuss issues more deeply. This makes it possible to grasp problems more accurately, and rely on collective leadership to make clear resolutions quickly. Compared with listening to reports at the district committee office, the district committee's resolutions are more in line with the actual situation of the factories and are easier to implement. Secondly, after doing so, the general call of the district committee is closely combined with individual specific guidance. The district committee secretariat and standing committee promote the work of the entire district by holding meetings in one factory and using the method of dissecting a "sparrow," making the district committee's leadership work more specific, meticulous, and solid, and more effectively guiding production. This leadership method of the Hedong District Committee of collectively going deep into the production front line has also promoted the leading cadres of various factories to further improve their leadership style. Now, leading cadres of factories throughout the district going deep into the masses and deep into reality is more common and more frequent.

(Reported by this newspaper from Shanghai on the 14th) Leading cadres of the Communist Party Committee of Luwan District, Shanghai, have further improved their leadership style and leadership methods in the increase production and practice economy movement, moving the district committee standing committee to key units to hold meetings, helping grassroots cadres solve ideological problems and specific problems. This approach has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of grassroots cadres and the broad masses of workers, and has also enabled district-level cadres to further learn from the experience of helping the lower levels solve problems and promoting the in-depth development of the increase production and practice economy movement.

Zhong Zhengzhai, first secretary of the Luwan District Committee, and all secretaries, ministers of various departments, and responsible persons of relevant district-level departments, recently went to the steelmaking workshop of Lishang Machinery Factory to hold an enlarged meeting of the district committee standing committee to discuss how to increase the steel output of this workshop. The meeting absorbed the factory's leaders, workshop director, production team leaders, and representatives of furnace front workers to participate.

The steelmaking workshop of Lishang Machinery Factory is a key unit in Shanghai's "small foreign group" of steelmaking. From January to July this year, their production situation was very good, with the daily output increasing from 17 tons to more than 20 tons. The output for seven months exceeded the entire output for last year by several times, and the quality was also improved. Under these circumstances, some cadres developed a blind complacency, and the steel output in August did not increase rapidly. At this enlarged meeting of the district committee standing committee, district committee leaders, together with everyone, analyzed the current excellent situation and studied the key problems of this steelmaking workshop.

Through ideological work, the cadres of Lishang Machinery Factory more clearly recognized the current excellent situation and the favorable conditions for completing the task, and their confidence was further enhanced. Zhong Zhengzhai, first secretary of the district committee, also worked with everyone to make detailed calculations, tap potential, and find problems. Some problems were to be solved by the factory itself, while several other specific problems could not be solved by the factory alone. The enlarged meeting of the district committee standing committee made an on-the-spot decision, ordering relevant departments to assist in solving them. For example, the district transportation bureau was to allocate a certain number of vehicles every day to transport materials for the factory; the Luwan District Office of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions was to give a piece of open space nearby to the factory for stacking materials, etc.

As soon as the meeting was over, the leading cadres of Lishang Machinery Factory immediately conveyed the resolutions of the enlarged meeting of the district committee to all employees. Cadres and workers were all jubilant and actively took action to strive for high quality and high output. Steelmaking workers shortened the smelting time of each furnace of steel by improving operating methods. The factory needed a guillotine machine, which was originally waiting for the help of an outside factory to produce. Now, the workers in the metalworking workshop immediately started to manufacture it themselves.

District committee leading cadres going deep into the grassroots and working with factory cadres and workers to carry out ideological work and help solve problems has promoted the further improvement of the leadership style of the leading cadres of this factory. Now, the cadres of this factory are going deep into various workshops and groups, working with workers, and studying and solving specific problems in production and workers' lives. The entire factory is full of enthusiasm and has set off a new upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy. According to statistics, within one week after the district committee held the standing committee meeting at this unit, the steel output level of this factory increased by about 45%.

    天津河东区委书记处到钢厂开会，钢铁指挥部到钢厂办公
    集体深入第一线  促进钢铁大增产
    上海卢湾区委到重点炼钢车间开会帮助具体解决问题
    本报天津14日电　中共天津市河东区委员会采取集体深入生产第一线的办法，领导增产节约运动，收到良好效果。集体深入生产第一线的具体作法是：在区委领导干部经常分别深入工厂参加生产领导生产的同时，区委书记处和常委经常到重点企业开会，帮助工厂解决关键问题；区委的钢铁指挥部搬到天津市第二钢厂，就地指挥全区钢铁生产。
    河东区是天津市生产钢和耐火材料的重点工业区。天津市第一、第二两大钢厂和天津市耐火器材厂都在这个区。为了领导好这些重点企业的生产，今年以来，区委书记处确定几名书记分别深入到钢厂和耐火器材厂的生产第一线种“试验田”，有的区委书记还搬到钢厂“落户”，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，深入细致地了解实际情况，帮助工厂及时解决问题。遇有工厂生产中的重大问题，区委便采取集体深入第一线的办法研究解决。例如，7月18
  日，区委在第二钢厂召开了区委常委会扩大会议，全面地研究了第二钢厂的工作，在肯定成绩的同时，细致地分析了这个厂当前生产中存在的重大关键问题，最后作出决议，在进一步加强生产管理、大搞群众运动和改进工作方法等方面，确定了三十多项具体措施。这个厂在8月份一开始，就进一步广泛发动群众，针对薄弱环节开展攻关竞赛，并且总结和推广了二百四十项单项操作经验和二十套成套经验，树立了各工种的新标兵三百七十多名，做到组组有标兵，有学赶超的目标，使8月份钢的生产水平显著提高，钢锭合格率提高5％多，生铁消耗降低了13％多，实现了区委常委会对这个厂8月份生产的要求。9月的前五天，这个厂的钢的平均日产水平又比8月下旬提高10％以上，每吨钢的生铁消耗又降低了七十四公斤。
    8月份钢铁战线展开增产节约运动以后，河东区委又进一步加强了对钢铁生产的领导。区委成立了钢铁指挥部，并且将区委钢铁指挥部搬到产量较大的天津市第二钢厂，就地领导全区的钢铁生产。钢铁指挥部由区委书记处书记李先元挂帅，并由区委各部、室的部长、主任、区人民委员会各局、室的局长、主任和一部分工厂的厂长、党委书记等一百多人，组成了交通运输、技术措施、生活福利和钢厂、耐火器材厂驻厂组等七个工作组。各个组一般都有一个区委常委或区委委员领导。生活福利组由区委常委、财贸部长担任组长，发动全区财贸战线职工开展了声势浩大的支援钢铁生产的群众运动。交通运输组由区委委员、管交通运输的副区长挂帅，为钢厂组织了二十八部汽车和三百八十多辆马车、三轮车，8月份就运输了五十三万八千多吨物资。区委的钢铁指挥部驻在钢厂，就更能及时掌握实际情况，及时发现问题，立即组织力量解决。例如，天津第二钢厂生产跃进以后，油砖车间的煅烧能力一时跟不上。区委钢铁指挥部发现这一情况以后，立即组织国营天津第三、第五棉纺织厂和天津油脂化学厂、河东区房屋修建公司等单位，抽调三百多名职工为第二钢厂突击建成了四十多座土白云石煅烧窑，迅速解决了这一问题。
    区委书记处和常委到工厂开会，是河东区委适应生产跃进的新形势，实行的一种好的领导方法。今年以来，河东区委已经先后在基层开过九次书记处或常委会扩大会议，而且从工厂扩大到城市人民公社和管区内的农村人民公社。这种会议有很多好处。首先，把深入第一线同进一步加强区委的集体领导制紧密结合起来。过去，一般都是个别的书记处书记或常委委员分别深入基层，虽然对推动生产作用很大，但是，有时遇到一些重大问题需要区委书记处或常委会研究决定，就不能很及时地处理。现在，区委书记处或常委会集体深入到第一线，就可以更快、更好地处理各种问题。区委书记处或常委会搬到工厂开会，能够在现场参观，在事先同工人交谈，必要时还吸收车间支部书记等列席会议，这样区委就能了解更多的生产情况和思想情况，掌握大量第一手材料，并且依靠集体智慧，更深入地研究讨论问题。这就可以把问题抓得更准确，并能依靠集体领导，迅速作出明确的决议。同在区委机关听汇报比较起来，区委的决议就更能切合工厂的实际情况，更便于贯彻执行。其次，这样做以后，把区委的一般号召和个别具体指导紧密结合起来。区委书记处和常委会通过在一个工厂开会，用解剖“麻雀”的办法推动全区的工作，使区委的领导工作更加具体、细致和扎实，更能有效地指导生产。河东区委这种集体深入生产第一线的领导方法，也推动了各工厂的领导干部进一步改善领导作风。现在，全区工厂的领导干部深入群众深入实际，更加普遍，更加经常。
    本报上海14日电　中共上海市卢湾区委会领导干部在增产节约运动中，进一步改进领导作风和领导方法，把区委常委会搬到重点单位去举行，帮助基层干部解决思想问题和具体问题。这一作法大大鼓舞了基层干部和广大职工群众的生产积极性，同时也使区级干部进一步摸到了帮助下面解决问题、推动增产节约运动深入开展的经验。
    卢湾区委第一书记钟正斋同志和全体书记、各部部长以及有关区级部门的负责人，最近到力生机器厂炼钢车间开了一次区委常委扩大会议，讨论这个车间如何提高钢产量的问题。会议吸收了这个厂的领导人、车间主任、生产小组长、炉前工人代表参加。
    力生机器厂炼钢车间是上海市炼钢“小洋群”里的重点单位。在今年1到7月，他们的生产情况很好，日产量从十七吨提高到二十吨以上。七个月的产量超过去年全年产量好几倍，质量也有所提高。在这种情况下，部分干部产生了盲目自满情绪，8月份钢产量上升的不快。区委领导同志在这次常委扩大会议上和大家一起，分析了当前的大好形势，研究了这个炼钢车间的关键问题。
    通过务虚，力生机器厂的干部更加认清了当前的大好形势和完成任务的有利条件，信心进一步增强。区委第一书记钟正斋同志还和大家一起算细账，挖潜力，找问题。有些问题由厂内负责解决，另外有几个具体问题单靠这个厂自己解决不了。区委常委扩大会议当场作出决定，责成有关部门协助解决。如区运输局每天要抽出一定的车辆，为这个厂运料；上海市总工会卢湾区办事处将附近的一块空地让给这个厂用来堆料等。
    会议一开完，力生机器厂领导干部立即把区委扩大会议的决议向全体职工作了传达，干部、职工个个欢欣鼓舞，积极行动起来力争优质高产。炼钢工人通过改进操作方法，缩短了每炉钢的冶炼时间。这个厂需要一部剪刀机，原来等待外厂帮助生产，现在金工车间的工人马上自己动手制造起来。
    区委领导干部深入基层和厂里干部、工人一起务虚，帮助解决问题，对这个厂的领导干部进一步改进作风起了推动作用。现在，这个厂的干部纷纷深入各车间、小组，和工人一起劳动，研究解决生产和工人生活方面的具体问题。全厂热气腾腾，掀起了增产节约的新高潮。据统计，区委在这个单位召开常委会后的一个星期内，这个厂的钢产量水平就提高了45％左右。
