Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, August 31st: A West German "Die Welt" correspondent in Washington revealed today that the United States is plotting to have the "UN forces" disarm the Congolese government army, so that the United States can more smoothly realize its colonialist ambitions to control the Congo through the United Nations.

The correspondent wrote that the United States may soon suggest that the United Nations forces disarm the Congolese army so that the United Nations mission in the Congo "can function effectively." According to the reporter, this vicious conspiracy is part of the US policy on the Congo currently being formulated by the White House. The reporter said that Washington's (original) obvious intention was to wait and see if Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba would "bring about his own downfall," but since the Prime Minister declared his intention to remove all white troops, Washington will not wait much longer. The reporter also said that the United Nations only has two or three weeks left to take action. Therefore, he expects the United States to begin implementing the above conspiracy in two or three weeks.

    美阴谋利用“联合国军”解除刚果武装
    新华社波恩8月31日电　西德“世界报”驻华盛顿记者今天透露，美国正在策划由“联合国军”解除刚果政府军队的武装，以便美国利用联合国控制刚果的殖民主义野心将更顺利地实现。
    这个记者写道，美国不久可能将建议通过联合国部队解除刚果陆军的武装，以便使联合国在刚果的代表团“能有效地起作用”。据这个记者报道，这个狠毒的阴谋是白宫现在正在制订的美国对刚果政策的一部分。记者说，华盛顿（原先）的明显的打算是等着瞧刚果总理卢蒙巴是否会“自招垮台”，但是自从这位总理宣称他的目的是使一切白人部队撤出以后，华盛顿是不会再等待很久的。这个记者还说，联合国只剩下两三个星期的时间可以采取行动了。因此，他预计美国将在两三星期后下手实施上述阴谋。
