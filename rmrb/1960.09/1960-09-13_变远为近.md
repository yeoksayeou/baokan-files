　　Turning Distance into Closeness

　　Remote fields have always been a weak link in field management. The soil quality and other natural conditions of remote fields may not necessarily be bad, but the yield is always relatively low. The reason lies in the fact that they are far from people's residences, "beyond the reach of the whip." As long as we find ways to strengthen their management, we can tap considerable potential for increased production in these areas.

　　In the movement to transform low-yielding fields in various parts of Shaanxi Province, establishing production points in remote fields is a good way to strengthen this weak link. Led by cadres and a group of strong laborers, camping in remote fields for a certain period of time can not only save travel time, but also greatly benefit "crop protection" and timely harvesting. Generally speaking, there is more grass in and around remote fields, so it is necessary to strengthen management; at the same time, this is a good condition for accumulating fertilizer. Establishing production points and accumulating fertilizer locally can greatly save labor for accumulating and transporting fertilizer.

　　Far and near are originally relative and can be transformed. When people go to camp in remote fields, the remote fields become near fields for these people; their yields are also likely to catch up with those of near fields.

    变远为近
    边远田，一向是田间管理的薄弱环节。边远田的土质和其他自然条件不一定就不好，但产量总是比较低。其原因，就在于它们离人们居住的地方远，“鞭长莫及”。只要想办法对它们加强管理，就能在这些地方挖出相当大的增产潜力。
    陕西省各地在改造低产田运动中，在远田建立生产点，是把这个薄弱环节加强起来的一个好办法。由干部带领一批精壮劳动力，一定的时期内在远田扎营，不但可以节省跑路时间，而且对“护青”和及时收获也大有好处。一般地说，边远田田里田边的草都比较多，有必要特别加强管理；同时，这又是积肥的好条件。建立生产点，就地积肥，积肥运肥的劳动力也可以大大节省。
    远和近，本来是相对的，也是能够转化的。人到远田去扎营，远田对这些人来说就变成了近田；它们的产量，也就有可能赶上近田。
