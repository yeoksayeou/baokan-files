Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 22nd. Steel Capital Anshan's city-wide workers, starting today, are holding a joint tackling-key-problems performance contest high-yield ten-day period, determined to create excellent results to celebrate National Day. Today, from dawn till dusk, the good news of Anshan Iron and Steel's various factories and mines creating new records and completing shift plans kept coming. The movement to increase production and practice economy, centered on steel, has already set off a bigger high tide in the Steel Capital.

Anshan's city-wide workers have already achieved great accomplishments in the movement to increase production and practice economy. Anshan Iron and Steel suffered a flood disaster in early August, and some blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces were forced to shut down. However, all the workers overcame the difficulties brought by the flood with soaring enthusiasm, enabling production to quickly return to normal. After the start of the movement to increase production and practice economy, production rose steadily. The daily output of steel ingots, steel, pig iron, iron ore, coke, and other products at Anshan Iron and Steel in the first twenty days of September was significantly higher than the average daily output in August. The quality of various products and the qualified rate of steel have been raised to new levels. Now, all the workers are determined to create better production results in the last one hundred days of this year, strive to compensate for the losses caused by the disaster, and ensure the comprehensive completion and over-fulfillment of this year's steel production plan. The high-yield ten-day period starting today is the first battle of the all-out effort for one hundred days.

In order to better and more deeply carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, the Anshan Municipal Party Committee, through its First Secretary Yang Shijie, made specific demands on the city-wide workers at today's mass meeting. After analyzing the current excellent situation in steel production, he called for a rapid launch of labor emulation campaigns between blast furnaces and blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces and open-hearth furnaces, to ensure the completion of production increase and economy plans on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis; carefully organize joint tackling-key-problems performance contests, focusing forces in batches to solve the main key problems in production increase. Workers from all departments in the city enthusiastically responded to the call of the Municipal Party Committee, stating that they would seize the current good opportunity of gradually cooling weather for steelmaking and advance victoriously. Various factories and mines challenged and accepted challenges from each other. The workers of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel continued to carry out the tackling-key-problems performance contest with the three-way combination of leading cadres, technicians, and workers, and the "one-dragon" cooperation of upper and lower processes. This form of competition has become a powerful weapon to promote the sustained leap forward in production at this plant. The two major key problems that once existed in this plant, namely, the insufficient turnover of molten steel ladles and steel ingot molds, have been solved in this tackling-key-problems performance contest. They have challenged the No. 2 and No. 3 Steelmaking Plants this time. The workers of the No. 2 and No. 3 Steelmaking Plants of Anshan Iron and Steel have accepted the challenge from the workers of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant. Currently, the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant is carrying out a competition to produce two heats of steel per open-hearth furnace per day. This movement has promoted the daily production level of the entire plant in the first twenty days of September to increase by more than 20% compared to August. The workers of this plant have all expressed their determination to learn from the example of the substantial leap forward of various steel plants in Shanghai, maintain the furnace body of the open-hearth furnace, and better complete the annual steel production plan. The workers of the No. 3 Steelmaking Plant are deeply discussing the plan for increasing production and practicing economy in the next one hundred days, setting daily struggle goals for each person, and resolutely guaranteeing the completion of plans on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis. The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's Ironmaking Plant, Gongchangling Iron Mine, Transportation Department, Chemical General Plant, Anshan Steel Plant, and more than a dozen other units are all contributing their efforts to over-fulfill the annual steel production increase plan. The slogan of action put forward by the ironmaking workers is: not only to guarantee the supply of sufficient molten iron for steelmaking but also to supply the best quality molten iron to support the steelmaking workers to shorten the steelmaking time and get more steel from time. The mining workers guarantee to produce more and better ore so that the blast furnaces can eat well and be full, supporting the ironmaking workers to increase pig iron production.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 22nd. While striving for high steel production in September, Wuhan Iron and Steel's workers are focusing on the preparation work for the fourth quarter's production. As early as the end of August, when discussing the September production plan, the workers of various plants and mines of Wuhan Iron and Steel repeatedly discussed the planned tasks for the fourth quarter and put forward concrete measures to complete the plan, striving for a substantial increase in steel production in the fourth quarter.

In the process of preparing for the fourth quarter's production, Wuhan Iron and Steel's workers paid special attention to improving the quality and output of raw materials. As the ore base of Wuhan Iron and Steel, Daye Iron Mine, from top to bottom, has specially studied measures to realize the supply of high-grade materials for Wuhan Iron and Steel's blast furnaces, including strengthening mining management and increasing mineral processing capacity. The workers of the sintering plant launched a mass movement to fiercely tackle the key production issues, increasing the production of sintered ore for the blast furnaces. The output of sintered ore in the first and middle ten days of September increased by nearly one time compared to the same period in August.

Another important aspect of Wuhan Iron and Steel's fourth-quarter production preparation is to strengthen equipment maintenance and repair and the production of spare parts. Not long ago, Wuhan Iron and Steel's various plants launched workers to conduct a universal inspection of equipment, and the hidden dangers found have been repaired and remedied in time. The company recently organized a batch of capital construction forces to carry out repairs on thirteen major pieces of equipment, seven of which have been completed. In terms of spare parts production, in addition to organizing external forces to assist, the Machinery Plant has also vigorously increased the production of spare parts to meet production needs as much as possible.

As the front lines of steel production, the steelmaking plant and the ironmaking plant are actively preparing to increase steel production in the fourth quarter. Each section and workshop of the steelmaking plant has drawn a batch of forces to clear the slag in front of the furnace, which has greatly facilitated the production of open-hearth furnaces. In order to meet the needs of increased steel production, they have taken measures to increase the capacity of some steel ladles, and also added equipment such as slag discharge tanks, slag ladles, and furnace repair machines. The ironmaking plant is currently strengthening the cleaning of raw materials, slag, and other aspects around the blast furnace to promote high-yield and high-quality blast furnaces.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 22nd. The Harbin Railway Bureau grasps the current production and transportation work with one hand and the preparation work for winter transportation with the other, to ensure the completion of the heavy winter transportation tasks.

The Harbin Railway Bureau's transportation volume accounts for more than 65% of the total transportation volume of the three railway bureaus in Heilongjiang Province. With the deepening of the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel, the transportation tasks of this bureau will be even more arduous this winter. This railway bureau began to prepare for the winter in mid-August. The bureau mobilized the workers to carry out the "three loves" movement of loving trains, loving roads, and loving equipment, and conducted a mass inspection of locomotives, vehicles, lines, communication signals, and various mechanical equipment, and comprehensively prepared for cold protection. At present, the machinery department has completed the cold protection preparation of more than 100 locomotives; the maintenance and cold protection preparation of water supply equipment has also been completed by more than 80%. In the vehicle department, the cold protection work such as the overhaul of passenger car heating devices has been fully completed. The engineering department mobilized workers to focus on strengthening the tamping of the roadbed and preventing frost damage, and carried out a major competition of red flag lines, red flag switches, and red flag bridges and culverts, setting off a high tide of major inspection and major maintenance.

    新华社鞍山22日电　钢都鞍山全市职工从今天开始，举行联合攻关表演赛高产旬，决心创造优异成绩向国庆节献礼。今天，从凌晨到傍晚，鞍钢各厂矿创造新纪录和完成班计划的捷报不断传出。以钢为中心的增产节约运动，已经在钢都掀起了更大的高潮。
    鞍山全市职工在增产节约运动中已取得很大成就。鞍钢在8月初曾遭受洪水灾害，部分高炉和平炉曾被迫停产。但全体职工以冲天的干劲战胜了洪水带来的困难，使生产迅速恢复正常。开展增产节约运动以后生产节节上升。鞍钢9月头二十天的钢锭、钢材、生铁和铁矿石、焦炭等产品的日产量，都比8月份的平均日产量有较大的增长，各种产品的质量和钢的合格率都提高到新的水平。现在，全市职工决心在今年最后一百天中，创造更好的生产成绩，努力补偿灾害的损失，保证全面完成和超额完成今年的钢铁生产计划。今天开始举行的高产旬，就是大干一百天的第一个战役。
    中共鞍山市委为更好地、深入地开展增产节约运动，市委第一书记杨士杰在今天的群众大会上，向全市职工提出了具体要求。他分析了当前钢铁生产的大好形势之后，号召迅速开展高炉与高炉、平炉与平炉之间的劳动竞赛，保证按日、按旬、按月的完成增产节约计划；认真的组织联合攻关表演赛，分期分批地集中力量解决增产中的主要关键问题。全市各部门职工热烈响应市委的号召，他们表示要抓住目前天气逐渐凉爽的炼钢良好时机，乘胜前进。各厂矿互相挑战应战。鞍钢第一炼钢厂的职工们，继续开展了领导干部、技术人员和工人三结合，上下工序组成“一条龙”的攻关表演赛。这种竞赛形式已经成为推动这个厂生产持续跃进的有力武器。这个厂曾经存在的钢水罐和钢锭模周转不开的两大关键问题，在开展这种攻关表演赛中得到了解决。他们这次向第二、第三炼钢厂提出了挑战。鞍钢第二炼钢厂、第三炼钢厂的职工已向第一炼钢厂职工应战。现在，第二炼钢厂正在开展每座平炉日产两炉钢的竞赛运动，这一运动已促使全厂9月头二十天的日产水平比8月份增长二成多。这个厂的职工们都表示要学习上海各钢厂大幅度跃进的榜样，维护好平炉的炉体，更好地完成全年产钢计划。第三炼钢厂职工正在深入讨论今后一百天的增产节约计划，订出每人每天的奋斗目标，坚决保证按日、按旬、按月完成计划。鞍钢炼铁厂、弓长岭铁矿、运输部、化工总厂、鞍山钢铁厂等十几个单位的职工们，都在为超额完成全年钢铁增产计划贡献一切力量。炼铁工人提出的行动口号是：不仅要保证供应炼钢足够的铁水，而且要供应质量最好的铁水，支援炼钢工人缩短炼钢时间，向时间要更多的钢。采矿工人们保证生产更多更好的矿石，让高炉吃得饱吃得好，支援炼铁工人增产生铁。
    新华社武汉22日电　武钢职工在9月力夺钢铁高产的同时，大抓第四季度生产准备工作。早在8月底，武钢各厂、矿职工在讨论9月份生产计划时，就反复讨论了第四季度的计划任务，并提出了完成计划的具体措施，力争第四季度钢铁产量大幅度增长。
    武钢职工在进行第四季度生产准备工作中，特别注意提高原料的质量和产量。作为武钢矿石基地的大冶铁矿，从上到下都专门研究了实现供应武钢高炉精料的措施，其中包括加强采矿管理、增加选矿能力等。烧结厂职工大搞群众运动，猛攻生产关键，为高炉增产烧结矿。全厂9月上中旬烧结矿产量比8月同期增长将近一倍。
    武钢四季度生产准备另一重要方面是加强设备维护检修和备品备件的制作。不久前，武钢各厂曾发动职工对设备进行了普遍检查，发现的隐患已及时作了修理和补救。全公司最近又组织了一批基本建设力量，对十三项重大设备进行了检修，其中七项已经完成。在备品备件制作方面，除组织外部力量协作支援外，机械厂也大力增产备品，尽量满足生产需要。
    作为钢铁生产第一线的炼钢厂和炼铁厂，正在积极进行提高第四季度钢铁产量的准备工作。炼钢厂各科室、车间已抽出一批力量，清除了炉前积渣，大大方便了平炉生产。为了适应钢产量增加的需要，他们采取措施增大了部分钢罐的容量，还增加了出渣槽、渣罐、补炉机等设备。炼铁厂目前正在加强高炉外围的原料、矿渣等方面的清理工作，以促进高炉高产优质。
    新华社哈尔滨22日电　哈尔滨铁路局，一手抓当前生产运输工作，一手抓冬季运输的准备工作，以保证完成繁重的冬季运输任务。
    哈尔滨铁路局运量占黑龙江省三个铁路局总运量的65％以上。随着以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动的深入开展，这个局今年冬季的运输任务更为繁重。这个铁路局在8月中旬就开始进行过冬的准备工作。全局发动职工开展了爱车、爱路、爱设备的“三爱”运动，对机车车辆、线路、通讯信号和各种机械设备，进行了群众性大检查，全面作了防寒的准备工作。现在，机务部门已有一百多台机车完成了防寒的准备工作；给水设备的检修和防寒准备工作也已经完成80％以上。在车辆部门，客车暖气装置的整修等防寒工作已全面完成。工务部门发动职工以加强对路基的捣固和预防冻害为重点，开展了红旗线路、红旗道岔、红旗桥梁涵洞的大竞赛，掀起了大检查大维修的高潮。（附图片）
