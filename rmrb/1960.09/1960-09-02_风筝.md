    Kite
    Vietnam, Hong He
    Xiao Qiu ran ahead, followed closely by a group of children. Several cowherds playing on the meadow behind the village also shouted loudly, picked up their feet, and chased after them, all heading towards the riverbank.
      "Look! The kite is flying over there! It's so beautiful, so beautiful!"
    The kite flew higher and higher, and the whistling sound became more and more energetic. This group of children gathered together, their heads held high, staring intently at the kite, which tilted in the northern sky like a small boat riding the waves.
    The children jumped happily, praising it endlessly:
      "It flies so high! It looks so big even from far away. If it fell to the ground, it would be at least as big as a ferry."
    Gusts of southeast wind blew from the sea, making people feel relaxed and comfortable. The kite seemed to be suspended in the azure sky, the string stretched tightly into a diagonal line by the wind, and the whistle sounded sometimes near, sometimes far. The children remained gathered together, arguing and praising.
    Suddenly, Xiao Qiu rushed forward a few steps, and he exclaimed, "The string is broken!" The children followed him and rushed forward in unison.
    The kite descended at an angle, flying over the river with the wind, flying over their heads.
    The two villages on either side of the river were only a hundred meters apart. In the past, the children's voices greeting each other seemed to still echo clearly in their ears.
    At this moment, four children ran out from behind the bushes on the north bank, the one running in front was a child with a bare upper body wearing only a pair of shorts, they didn't stop until they reached the riverbank.
    The Xianliang River was so lovely, with its rippling碧波, and several wooden boats sailed along the river towards the Songmen River estuary. The children stared at the river, feeling a kind of indescribable melancholy in their hearts.
    A child with his arms crossed in front of his chest stared blankly at the direction where the kite fell in the bamboo grove on the south bank and said:
      "You guys stand here and watch, I'll climb to the treetop to see where it fell."
    The child with the bare upper body said decisively:
      "I'll swim across the river and definitely bring the kite back."
    A few minutes later, six or seven more children ran over, gathering together, each panting and blaming each other, "That guy didn't tie the string tightly."
    Another continued, "The string wasn't strong, and the wind was strong, so the string broke."
    The child in the treetop reported in exasperation: "The kite fell behind the village on the south bank, you can find it as long as you swim across the river."
    The child who had just suggested crossing the river became even more anxious when he heard this "scout's" report.
    "We must get it back, let me swim across the river!"
    As he spoke, he quickly took off his pants, wrapped them around his head, and prepared to jump into the water.
    The other children immediately stopped him, saying:
      "Don't be reckless, the police on the south bank will break your bones, aren't you afraid?"
    "It's still early, the police have gone back to the camp to rest, they won't come out to patrol until sunset!"
    "Don't be silly, they are patrolling all the time."
    While the children were discussing, a group of children from the south bank also approached the river, Xiao Qiu walked in front, his hand raised high, holding the snow-white kite.
    In the afternoon, the wind became stronger and stronger, and they couldn't hear clearly what they were saying to the other shore. Two groups of children on both sides of the river were facing each other, as if they were planning something. At this time, two policemen on the south bank were patrolling back and forth. The children on the south bank panicked, Xiao Qiu hurriedly grabbed the kite and ran away. In the blink of an eye, they all hid behind the cassava field.
    The children on the north bank felt very disappointed and walked back sullenly.
    "Several days of work wasted!"
    The child with the bare upper body murmured:
    "Hmph! If the kite fell on the south bank, don't expect to get it back."
    The next day, when the sun just climbed over the treetops of the bamboo grove, they heard the whistling of the kite. The wind had started to change from late last night. In the early morning, the wind turned again from the high mountains, blowing over the Laobao Mountain. This dry hot wind pushed the cool air back into the blue ocean.
    In the morning, the group of children on the north bank came to the riverbank again. They watched the kite flying diagonally in the sky filled with dust, feeling very regretful. The waves on the river this morning were bigger than yesterday, and the waves rolled and crashed against the Xian'an Bridge in the heart of the river. The children were silent, and each young heart seemed to be stung by something.
    On the opposite bank, Xiao Qiu suddenly appeared behind the pineapple bushes, his hands placed next to his mouth making a megaphone, shouting with all his might, his clear voice荡过 the river, every word could be heard clearly:
    "The kite is for you!"
    The children on the north bank were puzzled by this sudden sound when they saw the kite in the sky suddenly lose its balance, tilting and flying quickly across the river with the wind, falling exactly into the village on the north bank.
    The children didn't have time to thank Xiao Qiu, they happily ran and jumped towards the village to find where the kite had fallen. After a while, the child with the bare upper body was still walking in front, his hand raised high, holding the kite, running out of the village, more than a dozen children closely following behind him, happily running back to the riverbank.
    The children stopped at the same place, staring intently at the opposite bank, preparing to say thank you to the children on the opposite bank. But the opposite bank was so quiet, and they couldn't see a single pedestrian.

    风筝
    越南　红河
    小求走在前头，一群小伙伴紧紧地跟着他跑。几个正在村后草地上游玩的牧童也高声叫喊起来，拔起脚来追上去，他们一股儿朝着江岸那边奔去。
      “看呀！那边的风筝飞起来了！美极了，美极了！”
    风筝越飞越高，哨声越叫越起劲。这群孩子汇聚在一起，脑袋仰得高高的，目不转睛地盯住那只在北岸上空倾倾斜斜像只乘风破浪的小船一样的风筝。
    孩子们欢乐地跳跃着，赞不绝口地说：
      “飞得多高呀！远瞧还这么大，如果落下地来，最小也像只渡船那般大。”
    阵阵的东南风从海面吹上来，令人感到轻松舒快。风筝像停留在蔚蓝色的晴空，线子顺着风势紧紧地拉成一条斜线，哨儿时近时远地响着。孩子们仍然聚集在一起，他们纷纷地争论着，赞美着。
    突然，小求向前猛冲几步，他惊呼道：“线断了！”孩子们不约而同地跟着他冲上去。
    风筝倾斜地降落着，顺着风儿凌空飞过江来，从他们头上飞过去。
    江两岸的两个村子，相距只有一百多米。从前，孩子们互相打招呼的声音似乎还清澈地在耳边回响。
    这时，从北岸上的树丛后面，跑出了四个孩子，跑在前头的是一个光着上身只穿着一条短裤的孩子，他们一直跑到江边才停下步。
    贤良江是那么可爱，碧波荡漾，几只木船沿着江边朝着松门江口驶去。孩子们凝望着江面，心里像有什么说不出的悒闷似的。
    一个双手在胸前打交叉的孩子，他呆呆地注视着风筝从南岸竹丛间坠落的方向说：
      “你们站在这儿瞧，我爬上树梢看它掉到哪儿去了。”
    光着上身的那个孩子果敢地说：
      “我游过江去，一定把风筝找回来。”
    几分钟以后，又跑来了六、七个孩子，他们聚集在一起，个个气喘吁吁地互相责备道：“那个家伙，线子缚得不紧。”
    另一个接着说：“线不牢固，风又大，所以才断了线。”
    在树梢的那个孩子气急败坏地报告情况：“风筝掉到江南那边的村后，只要游过江就可找到。”
    那个刚才提议过江的孩子，一听到这位“侦察员”的报道，心里更加焦急。
    “一定要把它找回来，让我游过江去！”
    说着，他很快地脱下裤子，再把它缠在头上，准备跳下水去。
    其他的几个孩子立刻阻挡说：
      “别逞强，南岸的警察会敲碎你的骨头，你不怕？”
    “还早嘛，警察回营休息去了，至少要等到太阳下山，他们才出来巡逻哩！”
    “别傻，他们什么时候都在巡逻哪。”
    孩子们正在议论纷纭的时候，南岸的一群孩子也走近江畔，小求走在前头，他的手高举着雪白的大风筝。
    下午，风力越来越大，他们向对岸讲些什么也听不清楚。两岸上的两群孩子正在面对着面，好像在筹划着什么似的。这时南岸那边的两个警察来回地巡逻着。南岸的孩子们慌了，小求急忙抓住风筝撒腿就跑。一转眼，他们全都躲到木薯地后去了。
    北岸的孩子们心里感到非常失望，闷闷地走回去。
    “几天的工夫白费了！”
    光上身的孩子喃喃地说：
    “哼！风筝掉到南岸，就别希望捡回来了。”
    第二天，当太阳刚爬上竹丛梢上的时候，就听到风筝的哨声。从昨天深夜里，风势就开始转了。清早，风又转从高山那边，越过劳保山吹来。这干燥的热风就把凉快的空气顶回到碧蓝色的海洋里去。
    早晨，北岸那群孩子又到江岸上来。他们注视着那只在弥漫着风尘的天空中斜斜飞起的风筝，心里感到十分惋惜。今早江面上的波浪比昨天大，浪花砥卷着横在江心中的先安桥哗啦哗啦地作响，孩子们沉默着，每颗稚小的心灵像被什么刺痛了一样。
    对岸，小求突然出现在菠萝丛后面，他的双手放在嘴旁作成个扩音筒，竭尽气力地大喊着，他那清脆的声音荡过江面，每个字都可清楚听到：
    “风筝送给你们了！”
    北岸的孩子们正给这突如其来的声音弄得莫名其妙的时候，看到天空上的风筝突然失掉平衡，倾倾斜斜地随着风势迅速地飞过江面来，恰好掉落到北岸的村子里。
    孩子们来不及向小求致谢，高兴得连跑带跳地朝着风筝掉落的方向走进村子里寻找去了。一会儿，仍然是那个光着上身的孩子走在前头，他的手高举着风筝，从村里跑出来，十多个孩子紧跟在他的背后，兴高彩烈地跑回江岸上来。
    孩子们停在原来那个地方，目不转睛地注视着对岸，准备向对岸的小朋友们说声谢谢。可是对岸是那么寂静，已看不到一个行人的影子了。
