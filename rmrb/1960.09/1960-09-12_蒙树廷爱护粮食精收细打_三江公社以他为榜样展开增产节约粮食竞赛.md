Meng Shuting Cherishes Grain, Harvests Carefully and Meticulously
Sanjiang Commune Takes Him as a Model to Launch a Grain Production Increase and Savings Competition

(According to Sichuan Daily news) Meng Shuting, a "Five-Good" commune member of the First Production Team of the Tenth Management District of Sanjiang People's Commune in Chongqing County, Sichuan Province, actively responded to the Party's call for increasing production and practicing economy. During the autumn harvest, he tried every means to harvest carefully and meticulously, and patiently helped others improve their harvesting techniques to reduce scattering, becoming a model for increasing production and saving grain throughout the commune.

Meng Shuting is fifty-one years old this year, from a poor peasant background, and possesses the thrifty virtues of the working people. He has always cherished grain. For example, during the summer harvest, there was a rainstorm one night, and he braved the rain and darkness to go to the fields to rush back more than forty bundles of wheat, avoiding scattering and mildew. When harvesting the spring crops, in addition to trying his best to reduce scattering, he also carried an apron with him, and always picked up a bag of fallen wheat ears when he finished work every day. During the summer harvest, he reduced scattering and increased grain production by about 400 catties in total.

Recently, Meng Shuting heard cadres convey the Party's call for increasing production and practicing economy, and vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, and felt extremely excited. He was determined to ensure that every grain of the abundant harvest was collected and stored in the autumn harvest. He paid close attention to finding ways to increase production and save grain. One day, he accidentally saw that the new-style threshing machine was equipped with a canopy, and felt that this was a good way to reduce scattering, so he took apart his bed sheet and made a temporary canopy. Commune members learned from this advanced experience, and every household took out their waste cloth or sheets, and canopies were hung on the sixty or seventy mixing barrels in the whole team and management district, which could reduce scattering of three or four catties of grain per barrel per day.

Meng Shuting not only paid attention to careful harvesting himself, but also tried every means to help others achieve careful harvesting. Once, he was lying sick in bed when he heard bursts of "dong, dong, dong" threshing sounds from the field, the sound as rapid as drumming. Based on his years of experience, he concluded that it must be a novice beating the "shua shua ba zi" (careless threshing). He immediately turned over, got out of bed, ran to the mixing barrel, pointed to the grains scattered in the field and said, "Look, this is simply threshing grain and sowing seeds at the same time. Young people must know the difficulty of producing grain. Before, when we rented landlords' fields, we had to pay seven or eight tenths of the rent for one mu of land a year, and we were forced to pay even if we were starving in disaster years. Now the Party and Chairman Mao are leading us to increase production. It is not only a pity to scatter the harvested grain, but also a disservice to the Party!" He said while imparting threshing techniques: "Look, it should be like this: the cut grain should be placed in a fan shape, and the threshing should be done with a 'rolling dragon handle'. Don't use dead force, the first two hits should be light, and then heavier, and you should shake it more..." With his patient help, Zhao Qingfeng and other young people quickly learned the threshing techniques.

During the autumn harvest, one day the third group did not complete the quota for threshing, and did not thresh cleanly. He was as anxious as if he had not completed his quota. The next morning, he rushed to the edge of the field of the third group to observe. He saw that Meng Fuyong, Zhao Xiuying and other short young people were standing in the rotten mud fields that were knee-deep in mud. They held the straw bundles above their heads, but they could not use their strength, and not only could they not thresh quickly, but they also scattered a lot. Therefore, he suggested that the team improve the labor combination, assigning taller commune members to thresh the rotten paddy fields, and shorter commune members to thresh the dry fields. After implementing this method, the grain was threshed quickly, and scattering and waste were also reduced.

Although Meng Shuting was not a cadre, he always took the initiative to check everywhere during the break from threshing. When he found scattering loopholes, he immediately made suggestions and blocked them. For example, once he checked a mixing barrel and found a hole the size of a wine glass at the bottom corner, he immediately squatted down to pick up the scattered grains, and then patched the hole. And he reminded everyone: "We must always pay attention to checking for scattering phenomena. The patch on the mixing barrel that Meng Yongqing is using is loose. I took a look, and every time you pull the barrel, you will scatter one or two liang of grain; you have to pull it more than thirty times to thresh one load of grain, which is enough to lose two catties of grain. Grain is the most precious treasure, and we must not lose even a little!"

Meng Shuting's actions to cherish grain have been highly valued by the Sanjiang Commune Party Committee. The commune Party committee convened a meeting of all commune Party branch secretaries, and decided to take Meng Shuting as a model to carry out a comparison and competition for careful harvesting, meticulous threshing, increasing production and saving grain during the autumn harvest. Commune members were mobilized to organize discussions based on Meng Shuting's deeds, so that the idea of increasing production and saving grain would be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. A vigorous competition movement to learn from, compare with, catch up with, and surpass Meng Shuting was immediately launched throughout the commune, and a large number of Meng Shuting-style figures emerged in various management districts. Luo Yuzhou and He Binghua, commune members of the Seventh Management District, in addition to actively harvesting and threshing grain carefully and meticulously, also carried "production increase bags" with them, and immediately picked up any scattered grain ears and grains they found on the ground. Granny Yang, who is over seventy years old in the Tenth Management District, specially made a bamboo brush and went to the fields to pick up grain every day, even picking up the grains that fell into the mud cracks.

### 蒙树廷爱护粮食精收细打  三江公社以他为榜样展开增产节约粮食竞赛

    蒙树廷爱护粮食精收细打
    三江公社以他为榜样展开增产节约粮食竞赛
    据四川日报消息：四川崇庆县三江人民公社第十管区第一生产队的“五好”社员蒙树廷，积极响应党的增产节约的号召，在秋收中千方百计精收细打，并耐心帮助别人提高收割技术，减少抛撒，成为全社增产节约粮食的标兵。
    蒙树廷今年五十一岁，贫农出身，具有劳动人民的勤俭美德。他一贯爱护粮食。如在夏收的时候，有天夜里发生暴风雨，他冒雨摸黑下田抢收回四十多捆小麦，避免了抛撒霉烂。收割小春时，他除了尽力减少抛撒外，还随身携带了个围腰，每天收工时总要拣回一包丢落的麦穗。在夏收中，总计他减少抛撒和增收粮食约四百多斤。
    最近，蒙树廷听干部传达了党的增产节约和大办农业、大办粮食的号召，心里感到无比的兴奋。他下定决心在秋收中保证丰收的粮食粒粒都收净归仓。他很留心寻找增产节约粮食的窍门。一天，他偶然看到新式打谷机上装有顶篷，感到这是一个减少抛撒的好办法，他就把自己的被单拆下来做成临时天篷。社员们学习了这个先进经验，家家户户都把自己的废布或布单子拿出来，全队、全管区的六、七十架拌桶上都挂起了天篷，每张桶每天能减少抛撒粮食三、四斤。
    蒙树廷不但自己注意精收细打，还千方百计的帮助别人做到精收细打。有一次，他正生病躺在床上，听到田坝里传来一阵阵“咚、咚、咚”的打谷声，声浪急促得好似擂鼓。凭着多年的经验，他断定这一定是生手打的“刷刷把子”。他马上翻身下床，跑到拌桶旁，指着溅撒在田里的谷粒说：“你们看，这简直成了又打谷子又播种了。年青人要晓得生产粮食的艰难。早前我们佃地主的田，种一亩田一年要交七、八成租，受灾年成挨饿也要逼着交。如今党和毛主席领导我们搞增产，把丰收的粮食抛撒掉了不但可惜，也对不起党啊！”他边说边传授打谷技术：“你们看，要这样：割下的谷子要放成扇子形，打谷要打‘滚龙把子’，不要使死劲，头两下轻，以后再重，要多抖……。”在他耐心地帮助下，赵庆丰等几个青年很快就学会了打谷技术。
    秋收中，有一天第三组没有完成打谷子的定额，也打得不干净。他急得像自己没有完成定额一样，次日一早，就赶到三组的田边观察。只见蒙福永、赵秀英等几个矮个子青年，站在陷到膝盖深的烂泥田里打谷。他们把禾把举得高过头顶，可总是使不上劲，不仅打不快，抛撒也大。于是，他就建议队里改进劳力组合，调高个子社员打烂漕田，调矮个子社员打干燥的田。实行这个办法后，谷打得快，抛撒浪费也减少了。
    蒙树廷虽然不是干部，可是在打谷子中途休息的时候，他总是主动地到处检查。发现了抛撒漏洞时，就立即提出建议，把它堵死。如有一次他检查到一架拌桶的下角露出一个酒杯大的漏洞，立即蹲下去拣起漏撒的谷粒，又将漏洞补了起来。并且提醒大家说：“我们要随时注意检查抛撒现象。蒙永清打的那架拌桶有个补巴拉脱了，我看了一下，拉一次桶要抛撒一两多谷子；打一挑谷子要拉三十多下，足足要漏掉两斤谷子。粮食是宝中之宝，可不能损失一点啊！”
    蒙树廷爱护粮食的行动受到了三江公社党委的高度重视。公社党委召开了全社党支部书记会议，决定以蒙树廷为榜样，在秋收中开展精收细打增产节约粮食的评比竞赛。发动社员对照蒙树廷的事迹组织讨论，使增产节约粮食的思想深入人心。一个轰轰烈烈的学、比、赶、超蒙树廷的竞赛运动，立即在全社开展，各个管区都出现了大批蒙树廷式的人物。七管区社员罗玉洲、贺炳华，除了积极精收细打谷子外，还随身携带“增产包”，发现了地上散落的谷穗谷粒，马上就拣起来。十管区七十多岁的杨婆婆，专门做了一个竹刷把，每天到田里拣谷，连落在泥缝里的谷子，也拾拣起来。
