Glory to labor!
Great is the Communist Party!
It is the Party,
That inscribes labor into the annals of education;
It is the Party,
That points out the direction of intellectual laborization! ...
We are tempered and grow in the crucible of labor,
Sweat washes away the filth on our souls,
The furnace fire refines it red;
A red heart dedicated to the Party,
We will forever advance on the road of redness and expertise! ...

At Tsinghua University, the song of labor is sung louder and louder. A group of tanned and strong young people, beating gongs and drums, happily arrived at the workshops of the university's comprehensive machinery factory, delivering letters of thanks to the worker师傅 (masters). They are the graduating students of Tsinghua University, and they are also young workers who have come to say goodbye to the masters.

This group of graduates consists of seventy-three students from the casting, manufacturing, welding, and pressure processing specialties of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Tsinghua University. In the spring of 1958, after studying at the university for four years, they participated in production labor at the university's factory for one year as ordinary workers. In their final year, they did real graduation designs. In their six years at the university, their political consciousness has been greatly improved. Taking "redness" to lead expertise, they have all learned many real skills. They not only systematically studied professional theoretical knowledge, but also mastered certain practical production knowledge and relatively proficient production techniques, taking a big step forward on the road to intellectual laborization. Upon graduation, they are excellent graduates and skilled workers. After skill assessment, all reached the level of third to sixth grade skilled workers. Teachers and veteran workers praised them as: "Good students and good workers who are both red and expert, capable both verbally and physically!"

From them, we see a new generation growing up!

In the process of production labor, students are constantly educated and gradually correct their attitude towards labor.

Two years ago, the students began the life of real new workers. At the beginning, they all enthusiastically responded to the Party's call to participate in labor, with the desire to train and transform themselves in labor, but they lacked ideological preparation to fundamentally transform their worldviews and become ordinary laborers. As time went on, or when they encountered difficulties, old ideas were exposed. Therefore, they set conditions when working, always wanting to find "technical work" to do, and unwilling to engage in ordinary physical labor; thinking it was "simple," "ordinary," and "repetitive," and therefore were careless when working. As a result, they produced defective products, had accidents, and affected the completion of production tasks. After truly becoming workers, production itself required them to have strict organization, discipline, and a high sense of responsibility, and everything had to proceed from the overall production situation. The Party organization put forward to them: "Every small task is a step towards laborization, a brick laid for socialist construction..." The worker师傅s also strictly demanded them according to the standards of a real worker. In the process of production labor, they were constantly educated and gradually began to take production seriously.

However, after working for a period of time, after they had initially learned some production techniques, some people felt: "We have learned almost enough technology, continuing like this is just simple repetition, too ordinary, too boring!" At this time, classmates who had come to the workshop to participate in short-term labor returned to class. Some people's thoughts fluctuated, and they felt that long-term labor was a "loss."

After this period of practice, they began to feel that the fundamental question before them was this: Is labor to be regarded as a means of seeking personal fame and gain, or should labor become the first need of life? Are you going to be a bourgeois intellectual, or a socialist-conscious, cultured laborer?

The workshop was a busy scene. Suddenly, sparks flew everywhere, lighting up the whole room. It turned out that there was a problem with the tapping hole of a furnace. At this critical moment, some students avoided it for fear of burning themselves, but the worker师傅 fearlessly braved the sparks and went up to block the tapping hole. Afterwards, the worker师傅 told the students: "The working class is the master of the country. Seeing that there is a problem with the furnace, we must not ignore it." This incident greatly educated the students. Another time, when a student was repairing a machine with a worker师傅, a piston suddenly jumped out of the machine and grazed past the student's face, hitting the师傅's hand and breaking his finger. However, the worker师傅 endured his own pain, and his first words were to care for the student and say, "Fortunately, it didn't hit your face." The noble qualities of the worker师傅, who sacrificed themselves for others and protected state property and comrades first when encountering danger, made most students realize that the worker师傅s were their role models.

In the summer of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the workshop was busy rushing to produce boiler-camel engines, producing a batch and immediately transporting it away to support the agricultural production front. Most of the students were working with the worker师傅s, forgetting to eat and sleep, experimenting with using nodular cast iron instead of steel to manufacture boiler-camel engines. Just as they were studying day and night to increase the temperature of the molten iron, a graduate student, contrary to everyone, wanted to use the collective labor results to find some experimental data for his thesis and draw some "curves," secretly adding alloys to the molten iron, resulting in a sharp drop in the temperature of the molten iron, and a whole furnace of molten iron was scrapped. This selfish and destructive behavior of sacrificing collective interests aroused public outrage. Originally, some students thought that this graduate student had "theory" and had also participated in short-term labor, and had a little "practical knowledge," and once regarded him as their "role model." After this incident, the students were shocked. The Party organization mobilized everyone to launch a discussion, exposing and criticizing the facts that affected production due to various bourgeois thoughts, making them see the true face of bourgeois intellectuals, realizing that the path of bourgeois intellectuals was a "dead end," and determined to "be like the 师傅"; realizing that some people originally thought that laboring for a period of time was "almost enough" and were afraid that long-term labor would be a "loss" was not right, and deeply felt that without unremitting conscious ideological transformation and long-term and repeated production labor training, they could not completely transform their thinking and worldview, and could not be laborized.

From then on, the students began to demand themselves according to the standards of a real worker, and more consciously learned from the worker师傅s. They often invited 师傅s to participate in group meetings and conducted political study in the same group as the workers. In the process of labor, the Party organization often set up models among students, inserted red flags, strengthened political and ideological education, and guided students to consciously transform themselves.

Any extraordinary product is created by ordinary labor and is the crystallization of workers' wisdom and sweat.

The furnace fire was burning very brightly, and Li Zhenbiao's heart was warm. He stared intently at the furnace chamber, and said happily to himself, "The furnace has become alive and obedient."

Originally, when he first arrived at the workshop a few months ago, he was assigned to burn the annealing furnace. Over time, he felt that this work was "simple" and "ordinary." He threw coal into the furnace chamber all day long. Who couldn't do that? What's the point of doing this all the time? He couldn't understand why the worker师傅 had been operating in front of the furnace for twenty years and was still so happy, and was so serious and conscientious every time he operated. He asked the veteran worker: "师傅, you have been operating in front of the furnace for so many years, just repeating this ordinary labor, don't you feel pain?" The师傅 replied angrily: "Before liberation, the capitalists forced me to sell myself, work for them, be beaten and scolded, and be exploited. Life was not guaranteed. I really felt pain. After liberation, I work for the country, for the people, and for myself. How can I feel pain?" The 师傅 also criticized him, saying, "You really don't know how lucky you are!" This gave him a very profound education. Because he was careless about production, once the coal for burning the furnace was changed, he still burned it according to the old method, resulting in a furnace of urgently needed castings being burned out, causing losses to production. This was caused by a contempt for "ordinary" labor. Gradually, Li Zhenbiao had new feelings for the furnace. He stayed by the furnace all day long, looking at the flames in the furnace chamber, and then looking at the annealed castings, as if he was fascinated. With the help of the师傅, and after continuous and careful study, he later knew roughly how high the temperature was just by looking at the flames, and he developed a set of "furnace chamber zoning firing method," which made the furnace fire burn vigorously, evenly, and save coal. After that, whenever he removed ash, seeing that the coal was not wasted and the parts were annealed just right, he felt the joy of labor creation from the bottom of his heart, and no longer felt simple and boring. When he was transferred away from the furnace to do other work, he said reluctantly, "I can't be separated from the furnace."

In labor, they gradually felt that physical labor was really "ordinary but not ordinary." On the eve of "July 1" in 1958, in order to offer a gift to the Party's birthday, the students used the parts and screws they produced with their own hands to trial-produce three new machine tools that used to rely on imports. When test driving, I only heard a sound: "Close the gate!", This machine, which was filled with their blood and sweat, seemed to have flesh and blood, and understood the master's mind, and quickly rotated. Everyone cheered excitedly for their creation in ordinary labor: "Success!" "Success!". In the past, when they saw machines, they first thought that they were conceived by engineers, but not that they were created by workers' labor. In labor, they personally realized that: any extraordinary product is created by ordinary labor and is the crystallization of workers' wisdom and sweat.

They call themselves a labor "pioneering team." Together with the worker师傅s, they used their hands to build a few laboratories with only dozens of staff into a factory that can accommodate more than 2,000 people and include seven workshops. Here, hundreds of machine tools and boiler-camel engines are produced and continuously transported to factories and rural areas. They also produced nodular cast iron rails. In this factory, they also participated in the testing and manufacturing of cutting-edge products such as program-controlled machine tools. Many major production and scientific research products of the school have a share of their labor, thus truly realizing the ordinary and great truth that "labor creates everything." As they said: "Precision machine tools are not mysterious, every nail and eye is made by man, how can all things in the world be obtained, all are exchanged for by labor."

After participating in long-term labor, the students' graduation designs are also more practical. They realized that labor is the most valuable book.

The students earnestly studied Chairman Mao's works in labor. They opened "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and repeatedly read this passage: "At this time, comparing unremolded intellectuals with workers and peasants, one feels that intellectuals are unclean, and the cleanest are still workers and peasants. Although their hands are black and their feet have cow dung, they are cleaner than bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals. This is called a change of feelings, from one class to another." After a year of labor, they felt particularly cordial about these words of Chairman Mao. Hu Saiyu, who had lived a life of "open mouth for food and outstretched hands for clothing" since childhood, despised labor and the working people. In the past, when she saw that her uncle was a worker who always got "dirty and tired" after get off work every day, she mistakenly thought that she would definitely not be a worker in the future. Now, she is a worker. After labor tempering, her thoughts and feelings have slowly changed. The "dirty and black" casting molding sand in the workshop has begun to become something she likes. She said: "Seeing it, I want to grab a handful, and I feel it is warm and soft." One cold winter night, Hu Saiyu woke up and saw the north wind howling and snow flying outside the window. She immediately thought that the sand in the workshop would freeze and affect the next day's production. She immediately got up from the warm bed and ran to the workshop to set up a bundle of grass to light a fire and bake the sand. The fire burned brighter and brighter. When she saw that the sand was still soft, she felt that this was joy and happiness.

Now, they are proud of being a worker-student. When some students carried toolboxes to the suburbs of Beijing or to the rural areas of Shandong thousands of miles away to help farmers repair the boiler-camel engines they produced, someone asked them if they were college students. They replied loudly, "We are college students and workers." People can no longer see that they are the college students looking like the past "white-faced scholars." Once, a few of them went to a factory outside to support a temporary rush task and worked for many days. The workers in that factory did not know that they were college students, and thought they were "师傅s" from brother factories to support production. Before leaving, when the workers learned that they were students of Tsinghua University, an old worker said excitedly: "Chairman Mao has trained college students of our working class." Labor is becoming a need in their lives. When a student returned home on vacation, he saw workers in an iron factory on the street beating iron, so he ran in, rolled up his sleeves and threw the sledgehammer with the workers. They have new feelings for labor.

At the graduation defense meeting, the teachers gave good evaluations to their graduation designs, and all of their graduation designs achieved excellent results. After the worker师傅s' skill assessment, they also reached the level of third to sixth grade skilled workers respectively. From them, we saw a new generation growing up who can engage in both mental and physical labor. They can not only independently carry out design work, but also manufacture, install, and even produce, and finally summarize, improve, and then write papers.

One day, in their comprehensive machinery factory, engineering technicians from more than 20 factories in Beijing came and watched their gear shaving, milling, and fine turning gear performances with rapt attention. Then, they listened to their academic paper reports. Originally, in their graduation design, after hundreds of times of personal production experiments, they successfully completed the design of "design and calculation of fine turning shaving cutter" and applied it to production, solving the key problem of small and medium-sized machinery manufacturing plants in efficiently processing high-quality gears, and it is of great significance to the technological revolution of gear tools. Everyone unanimously praised their graduation design and academic paper report as reaching a fairly high level, and many people asked for drawings and data on the spot, preparing to go back to promote and apply them.

After participating in long-term production labor, the students' graduation designs are more creative and more practical. When they designed the hot blast stove, according to the old theory, complex processing and high-quality materials were required for manufacturing, but they proceeded from reality, and based on their experience with the worker师傅s in making small blast furnaces, they boldly adopted some new methods that some engineers thought were "not in the books" and "unreliable," and designed and manufactured it by themselves, which greatly improved the key sealing of the hot blast stove. In the practice of production labor, they realized that labor is the most valuable book and an inexhaustible source of knowledge.

"Iron can only be made into steel in a high-temperature furnace. Intellectuals must be tempered in physical labor to be laborized." This is their common experience in labor. They said that on the road to intellectual laborization, although we have "only taken the first step of the Long March," we are determined to continue to move forward with our heads high, and determined to be a socialist-conscious, cultured laborer for life.

    清华大学机械制造系学生下厂劳动一年提高了思想学到了本领
　　在知识分子劳动化道路上迈了一大步
      光荣啊，劳动！
      伟大啊，共产党！
      是党，
      把劳动载入教育的史册；
      是党，
      指出了知识分子劳动化的方向！……
      我们在劳动的熔炉里锻炼成长，
      汗水洗去我们心灵上的污垢，
      炉火把它炼得通红；
      红色的心献给党，
      我们永远前进在红专大道上！……
    在清华大学里，劳动的赞歌，越唱越响亮。一群黝黑健壮的年青人，敲锣打鼓，兴高彩烈地来到校内综合机械厂的车间里，把一封封感谢信送给工人师傅。他们是清华大学应届毕业生，他们也是来和师傅告别的青年工人。
    这批毕业生，是清华大学机械制造系铸工、制造、焊接、压力加工四个专业的学生，一共七十三人。1958年的春天，他们在大学学习了四年之后，又以普通工人的身份，到校内工厂参加了一年的生产劳动。最后一年，他们又作了真刀真枪的毕业设计。他们在大学的六年中，政治觉悟有很大提高，以红带专，都学到了许多真正的本领。他们不仅系统地学习了专业理论知识，而且掌握了一定的实际生产知识和较为熟练的生产技术，在知识分子劳动化的道路上向前迈进了一大步。毕业时，他们是优秀的毕业生，又是技术工人。经过考工，全部达到三级到六级技术工人的水平。教师和老工人称赞他们是：“又红又专，能文能武，能说能干的好学生，好工人！”
    从他们身上看到了一代新人在成长！
    在生产劳动的过程中，学生们不断受到教育，逐步端正了对待劳动的态度
    两年前学生们开始了真正的新工人的生活。开始时他们都是热烈地响应党的号召，参加劳动，有在劳动中锻炼和改造自己的愿望，但是对于要根本改造世界观，做一个普通劳动者，却缺乏思想上的准备。时间一长，或是遇到了困难，旧思想就会暴露出来。因而劳动时讲条件，尽想找“技术活”干，不愿从事普通的体力劳动；认为它“简单”、“平凡”、
  “重复”，因而劳动时漫不经心。结果出废品，出事故，影响生产任务的完成。真正地当工人之后，生产本身要求他们有严格的组织性、纪律性和高度的责任心，一切必需从生产的整体出发。党组织向他们提出：“每一件细小的工作都是向劳动化迈进的步子，都是为了社会主义建设砌一块砖……。”工人师傅也都以一个真正的工人的尺度严格地要求他们了。在生产劳动的过程中，他们不断受到教育，逐渐开始认真对待生产了。
    可是，劳动一段时间，他们初步学到了一些生产技术之后，有的人又觉得：“技术学得差不多了，再这样干下去，就是简单的重复，太平凡，太乏味了！”正在这时，和他们一起到车间参加短期劳动的同学回去上课了。有的人思想波动起来，觉得长期劳动“吃亏”了。
    经过这一时期的实践，他们开始感到，摆在他们面前的是这样一个根本问题：是把劳动看做谋取个人名利的手段呢，还是要使劳动成为生活的第一需要？是做资产阶级知识分子呢，还是做一个有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者？
    车间里一片繁忙的景象。忽然间，铁花四射，照得满屋通红。原来是一个炉子的出铁口出了毛病。在这紧急的时刻，有的学生怕烫了自己便避开了，工人师傅却奋不顾身地冒着铁花上去堵住了出铁口。事后工人师傅对学生说：“工人阶级是国家的主人，眼看着炉子出了毛病，我们决不能不管。”这件事使学生们受到了很大的教育。又一次，一个学生和工人师傅一起修理机器时，机器上有个活塞突然跳了出来，从这个学生的面前擦过，打在师傅的手上，把手指打坏了。可是，工人师傅却忍受自己的疼痛，第一句话就关怀地对那个学生说：“幸亏没有打在你的脸上。”工人师傅这种舍己为人、遇见危险首先保护国家财产，保护同志的高贵品质，使大多数学生认识到工人师傅就是自己的榜样。
    大跃进的1958年的夏天，车间里正在紧张地赶制锅驼机，生产一批马上就运走一批，支援农业生产前线。多数学生正和工人师傅一起，废寝忘食，试验用球墨铸铁代钢制造锅驼机。就在他们日夜钻研提高铁水温度的时候，有一个研究生，和大家相反，却想利用集体的劳动成果，为自己的一篇论文找什么实验数据，画什么“曲线”，偷偷地往铁水里乱加合金，结果使铁水温度急骤下降，一炉铁水全报废了。这种自私自利、不惜牺牲集体利益破坏生产的恶劣行为，引起大家的公愤。原来有的学生还认为这个研究生有“理论”，也参加了短期的劳动，有一点“实际的知识”，曾以他为自己的“榜样”。这件事发生后，使学生们大吃一惊。党组织发动大家展开了一场讨论，揭发和批判了由于形形色色资产阶级思想而影响生产的事实，使他们看清了资产阶级知识分子的真面目，认识到资产阶级知识分子的道路是“死胡同”，决心“做师傅那样的人”；认识到原来有的人认为劳动一段时间“差不多”了，怕劳动时间长“吃亏”的思想不对头，深刻地感到不经过不懈的自觉的思想改造，和长期、反复的生产劳动锻炼，就不能彻底改造自己的思想和世界观，就不能劳动化。
    从此，学生们开始以一个真正的工人尺度来要求自己，更自觉地向工人师傅学习。开团小组会，也常请师傅参加，和工人在一个小组进行政治学习。在劳动过程中，党组织经常在学生中树立典型，插红旗，加强政治思想教育，引导学生自觉地改造自己。
    任何一件不平凡的产品，都是由平凡的劳动创造出来的，都是工人智慧和汗水的结晶
    炉火烧得很旺，李振标的心里热呼呼的，他全神贯注地望着炉膛，高兴地自言自语道：“炉子变活了，变得听话了。”
    原来，几个月前他刚到车间时，就被分配烧退火炉，天长日久，他就觉得这活“简单”、“平凡”，整天把煤往炉膛里甩，谁不会干？老干这个有什么意思？他不能理解工人师傅为什么在炉前操作已经二十年了，还是那样有乐趣，每次操作时都是那样严肃、认真。他问起这位老工人：“师傅，你在炉前操作这么多年，只是重复这种平凡的劳动，难道不感到痛苦吗？”师傅很生气地回答：“解放前，资本家逼着我卖身画押，为他干活，挨打挨骂，受人剥削，生活都没有保证，确实感到很痛苦。解放后，我为国家、为人民、也为自己劳动，怎么会感到痛苦呢？”，师傅还批评他说：“你真是身在福中不知福”！这使他受到了极深刻的教育。由于对生产漫不经心，有一次烧炉的煤换了，他还是按老办法烧，结果把一炉急用的铸件烧坏了，给生产带来了损失。这是对“平凡”劳动的轻视所造成的。慢慢地李振标对炉子有了新的感情，整天不离炉边，一会儿看看炉膛火焰，一会儿又看看退火的铸件，好像着了迷似的。在师傅的帮助下，经过不断的认真钻研，后来他只要看看火焰就知道温度大致有多高，并且摸索出一套“炉膛分区烧火法”，使炉火烧得又旺、又匀、又省煤。这以后，他每当出灰时，看到煤没有浪费，零件退火恰到好处，就从内心里发出劳动创造的喜悦，再也不感到简单、乏味了。当调他离开炉子去做别的工作时，他恋恋不舍地说：“自己和炉子有点儿分不开了。”
    在劳动中，他们逐渐地感到了体力劳动真是“平凡而又不平凡”。1958年“七一”前夕，为了向党的生日献礼，学生们用亲手生产出的零件、螺丝，试制出三台过去靠进口的新机床。试车时，只听一声：“合闸！”，这贯注了他们血汗的机器，好像有了血肉，懂得主人的心意，迅速地旋转起来。大家为自己在平凡劳动中的创造激动地欢呼：“成功了！”“成功了！”。过去，他们看到机器，首先想到它是工程师脑袋里想出来的，而不认为是工人劳动创造出来的。他们在劳动中才亲身体会到：任何一件不平凡的产品，都是由平凡劳动创造出来的，都是工人智慧和汗水的结晶。
    他们称自己是一支劳动的“创业队”，他们和工人师傅一起，用双手把只有几十个工作人员的几个实验室建成了一个能容纳二千多人、包括七个车间的工厂。在这里，生产出几百台机床和锅驼机，源源运往工厂和农村。他们还生产了球墨铸铁铁轨。在这个工厂里，他们还参加了程序控制机床等尖端产品的试验和制造，学校许多重大的生产和科学研究产品，都有他们的一份劳动，从而真正体会到“劳动创造一切”这一平凡而伟大的真理。正如他们说的：“精密机床不神妙，一钉一眼人制造，人间万物何所得，皆由劳动换得来。”
    长期参加劳动后，学生们的毕业设计也更加符合实际。他们体会到：劳动是最宝贵的书本
    学生们在劳动中认真地研读毛主席的著作。他们翻开“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，反复地读着这一段话：“这时，拿未曾改造的知识分子和工人农民比较，就觉得知识分子不干净了，最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净。这就叫做感情起了变化，由一个阶级变到另一个阶级。”经过一年的劳动之后，对毛主席的这些话就感到格外亲切。胡塞育，从小过着“饭来张口、衣来伸手”的生活，轻视劳动和劳动人民，过去，她看到舅父是个工人，每天下班回来总弄得“又脏又累”，她十分错误地想将来自己一定不当工人。现在，她当了工人，经过了劳动的磨炼，思想感情也慢慢地发生了变化。车间里“又脏又黑”的铸件造型用砂，开始成了她喜爱的东西了。她说：“看见它就想抓一把，觉得它又温暖，又松软。”一个严寒的冬夜，胡塞育一觉醒来，窗外北风呼啸，大雪纷飞，她立即想到车间里的砂子要上了冻，就会影响第二天的生产。便一骨碌从热被窝里爬起来，跑到车间架起一捆草点火烤砂子。火越烧越旺，她看到砂子还是松软的，感到这就是愉快和幸福。
    现在，他们为自己成为一个工人大学生感到自豪了。有的学生背着工具箱，到北京郊区、到千里外的山东农村去帮助农民维修他们生产出来的锅驼机时，有人问他们是大学生吗？他们响亮地回答，“我们是大学生，也是工人。”人们已经看不出他们是过去的“白面书生”的大学生模样了。一次，他们有几个人到外面一个工厂支援临时突击任务，干了许多天，那个工厂的工人还不知道他们是大学生，以为是兄弟厂来支援生产的“师傅”。临走时，当工人们得知他们是清华大学的学生，一位老工人激动地说：“毛主席可给咱们培养了工人阶级自己的大学生。”劳动正在变为他们生活中的需要，一个学生放假回到家中，在街上看到一个铁工厂里的工人在打铁，就跑进去，卷起袖子和工人一起扔大锤。他们对劳动有了新的感情。
    毕业时，在毕业设计的答辩会上，教师们对他们做出的毕业设计给予很好的评价，他们全部的毕业设计都达到优良的成绩。经过工人师傅的考工，他们还分别达到了三级到六级的技术工人的水平。从他们身上看到了正在成长的既能从事脑力劳动、又能从事体力劳动的一代新人。他们不仅能独立进行设计工作，而且能制造、安装直到生产，最后总结提高再写成论文。
    一天，在他们的综合机械厂里，来了北京二十多个工厂的工程技术人员，聚精会神地观看了他们进行的剃床、铣床、车床的精车剃齿表演，然后，又听了他们做的学术论文报告。原来，他们在毕业设计中，经过上百次的亲手生产试验，出色地完成了“精车剃齿刀的设计与计算”的设计，并应用于生产，解决了中小型机械制造厂以高效率加工高质量齿轮的关键问题，对齿轮刀具的技术革命具有重大的意义。大家一致称赞他们的毕业设计和学术论文报告达到相当高的水平，并且当场就有许多人要了图纸资料，准备回去推广应用。
    参加长期的生产劳动之后，使学生们的毕业设计更富有创造性和更加符合实际。他们在设计热风炉时，按照旧理论设计，制造时就需要复杂的加工和优质材料，但他们从实际出发，根据和工人师傅一起搞小高炉时的经验，大胆地采用了某些工程师认为“书本上没有过的”“不可靠”的新的方法，亲手设计并把它制造出来，使热风炉的关键的密封的程度大大提高了。在生产劳动的实践中，他们体会到：劳动是最宝贵的书本，是取之不尽的知识源泉。
    “铁要在高温的熔炉里才能炼成钢，知识分子必须在体力劳动中锻炼，才能劳动化。”这是他们在劳动中的共同体会。他们说，在知识分子劳动化的道路上，虽然我们“像万里长征才走了第一步”，但是我们决心昂首阔步地继续前进，立志终身做一个有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者。
