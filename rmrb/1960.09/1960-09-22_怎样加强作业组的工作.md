    How to Strengthen the Work of Task Groups

    The Wuzhou Brigade of Pingli Commune in Lianhua County has adopted the following effective measures: rationally allocate labor and leadership backbone to task groups; delineate the scope of authority between team leaders and task group leaders; establish a production responsibility system; and elect fair and capable people to serve as group leaders.

    Our newspaper, Nanchang, 20th dispatch: The Wuzhou Brigade of Pingli Commune in Lianhua County, Jiangxi Province, is conscientiously strengthening the work of each task group, effectively promoting autumn production.

        The Wuzhou Brigade has eleven production teams, with a total of thirty-six fixed, year-round task groups.
    The brigade's measures to improve the task groups first adjusted the original forty-two task groups to thirty-six based on the amount of farmland in each group, the distance of residence, and the rational allocation of labor and cadres, so that each task group was roughly balanced in terms of land burden and labor allocation. On this basis, a production responsibility system for task groups was established, implementing a "four-fixed" system of fixed tasks, fixed time, fixed quality, and fixed work points. Within the task group, a field management responsibility system was established according to the group's tasks. A wooden sign was inserted at each field, stating the place name, area, crop type, production task, specification requirements, and the name of the person responsible for management, so that responsibility was assigned to each plot and to each person. At the same time, a "two, four, six" three-level field comparison and inspection system was implemented, that is, task groups inspected every two days, teams inspected every four days, and the brigade inspected every six days, to urge and encourage commune members to better complete their tasks.

    Helping task groups arrange production in the short term is another important measure taken by the Wuzhou Brigade to strengthen the fighting power of the groups. At present, each task group has implemented a system of making short-term production arrangements every two to four days. Each task group arranges the farm work that needs to be done in two to four days, according to priority, as a plan of action for all members of the group. For example, in the past, although the Dajiangzhou Team had made arrangements and requirements for production, after these were passed down to the task groups, production often could not be carried out in an orderly manner due to a lack of specific arrangements. In the management of autumn fields, after this team promoted short-term group production arrangements, the task group leader was able to lead production in an organized manner, and the commune members' actions were busy but not chaotic. The autumn field management was carried out both vigorously and practically, and the three weeding and topdressing operations were completed on time, in quantity, in quality, and according to plan. In addition, because the team's plan was broken down into smaller parts and specifically arranged for the task groups, the commune members were more confident in completing the plan, had more enthusiasm, and vigorously promoted autumn production.

    Under the unified leadership of the team, the division of labor between the team and the task groups is clear, so that the task groups have duties, powers, and responsibilities. This is another important measure taken by the Wuzhou Brigade to strengthen the work of the task groups. The brigade stipulates that under the unified leadership of the brigade and the team, the task groups are specifically responsible for organizing all work and production; each task group has the right to arrange and deploy the labor force within its group according to the needs of production. At the same time, each task group can also formulate its own production plan and inspection and evaluation system according to its specific situation. This can not only reduce the burden on production team cadres, allowing them to free up more time to participate in production, grasp the work of the entire team, and carry out political and ideological education, but also give play to and mobilize the initiative and enthusiasm of the task groups in doing a good job in production. After the Jiangshang Team and the task groups clarified the division of labor, the captain and the group leader each had their own responsibilities, each performed their own duties, cooperated, and were of one mind, making the autumn production of this team lively and fruitful. At the same time, since the task groups have the clearest understanding of the special skills of their group, after the task groups have duties, powers, and responsibilities, they can arrange production and use labor more rationally, and make production better and better.

    In order to better play the role of production task groups, the Wuzhou Brigade has strengthened the training and education of task group cadres. In the past, brigade cadres focused more on teams and less on task groups; now the brigade emphasizes that whether they are brigade or team cadres, they must all focus more on and do a good job with the task groups, help the task groups do a good job in production, act as advisors, offer more ideas and methods to the task group leaders in production and work, and constantly improve the level of the task group leaders. When Zhou Guijun, the secretary of the brigade party general branch, went to the third task group of the Huajia Team, he found that the weeding and topdressing progress of this group was slow. He immediately found the task group leader, Hua Tingxiang, to inspect the fields together and held discussions with old farmers. He found that the labor arrangement of the group was unreasonable, with two male laborers assigned to weed and women assigned to deliver fertilizer. After finding the reason, he immediately replaced the women with the men for weeding, and the male laborers for delivering fertilizer, and the production progress was significantly accelerated.

    Selecting fair, capable, and well-loved people from the masses to serve as task group leaders is also an effective measure taken by the Wuzhou Brigade to strengthen the work of the task groups. All seventy-two task group leaders in the Wuzhou Brigade are now publicly elected from the masses, with people from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds accounting for 90%; party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists account for thirty-seven, more than 50%; and the rest are also labor models or commune members with rich production experience. After these people took over the leadership of the task groups, they all actively took the lead in hard work in production, and were able to closely connect with the masses, unite the masses, and work together with the masses to do a good job in production. By strengthening the leadership of the task groups, sixteen (80%) of the original twenty backward task groups in the entire brigade have been transformed into advanced groups.

　　怎样加强作业组的工作
　　莲花县坪里公社五洲大队采取以下有效措施：合理配置作业组的劳力和领导骨干；划分小队队长和作业组组长的职权范围；建立生产责任制度；选举办事公道而又能干的人担任小组长。
    本报南昌20日电　江西莲花县坪里公社五洲大队认真加强各个作业
  小组的工作，有效地促进了秋季生产。
      五洲大队有十一个生产小队，共有三十六个固定性的常年作业组。
  大队抓好作业小组的措施，首先根据每个小组的田亩多少、居住远近以
  及劳力、干部的合理配置，将原来四十二个作业小组调整为三十六个，
  使每个作业小组在土地负担、劳力分配等方面大体趋于平衡。在这个基础上，建立作业小组的生产责任制，实行定任务、定时间、定质量、定工分的“四定”制度。作业小组内根据小组的任务建立田间管理责任
  制，在每块田头插个木牌，牌上写明地名、面积、作物种类、生产任务、规格要求以及负责管理人的姓名，把责任落实到丘、到人。同时，实行“二、四、六”三级田头评比检查制度，即作业小组两天一检查，小队四天一检查，大队六天一检查，以督促和鼓舞社员更好地完成任务。
    帮助作业小组短期安排生产，是五洲大队加强小组战斗力的另一重要措施。目前各个作业小组，都实行了每两天到四天作一次生产短安排
  的制度。每个作业小组将二至四天内需要做的农活，按照轻重缓急，一项项排列，作为全组社员的行动计划。如大江洲小队过去虽然对生产有布置，有要求，但下到作业小组后，往往因为缺乏具体的安排，不能确保生产有头有绪地进行。在秋田管理中，这个小队推行了小组生产短安排后，作业组长领导生产便有条有理，社员行动忙而不乱，秋田管理搞得既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实，三次耘田追肥都做到了按时、按量、按质、按计划完成。此外，由于将小队计划化整为零，一段段具体安排到作业小组，社员们对完成计划心里就更有了底，信心更足，干劲更大，也有力地推动了秋季生产。
    在小队统一领导下，小队与作业小组之间分工明确，使作业小组有职、有权、有责。这是五洲大队加强作业小组工作的又一重要措施。这个大队规定：作业小组在大队、小队的统一领导下，各项工作、生产由小组具体负责组织；各个作业小组根据生产的需要，对本小组内的劳动力有权安排、调度。同时，每个作业小组按照自己的具体情况，还可以制订本组的生产计划以及检查、评比制度。这样，不仅可以减轻生产小队干部负担，使小队干部腾出更多的时间参加生产，抓好全队的工作，搞好政治思想教育，而且还能发挥与调动作业小组搞好生产的主动性与积极性。江上小队与作业小组明确分工后，队长、组长各有其责，各司其职，分工合作，上下一条心，使这个小队的秋季生产搞得有声有色。同时，由于作业小组对本组的特长了解掌握最清楚，因此作业小组有了职权责任后，还能做到更合理地安排生产和使用劳力，把生产越搞越好。
    五洲大队为了更好地发挥生产作业小组的作用，加强了对作业小组干部的培养教育。过去大队干部抓小队多，抓作业小组较少；现在大队强调无论是大队或小队的干部，一律要多抓、抓好作业小组，帮助作业小组搞好生产，当好参谋，多给作业组长在生产和工作上出主意，想办法，不断提高作业小组长的水平。大队党总支书记周桂军深入花家小队第三作业小组时，发现这个小组耘田追肥进度慢，当即找作业组长花亭香到田间一同检查，并找老农座谈，发现小组的劳动力安排不合理，将两个男劳力安排耘田，而让妇女去送肥。原因找出之后，立即将妇女换去耘田，男劳动力换去送肥，生产进度便显著加快。
    通过群众挑选公道能干、深受社员爱戴的人担任作业小组长，也是五洲大队加强作业小组工作的一项有效措施。五洲大队现在七十二个作业组长干部，全部是由群众中公选出来的，出身于贫农和下中农的人占了90％；其中党、团员和积极分子有三十七人，占50％多；其余也是劳动模范或生产经验丰富的社员。这些人担任了作业小组的领导之后，生产上都是积极带头苦干，并能密切联系群众，团结群众，与群众协力搞好生产。通过加强作业小组的领导，全大队原来二十个后进作业小组已有十六个（占80％）变成了先进小组。
