　　Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: In accordance with the state's policy of prioritizing the development of mining industries, the metallurgical industry department is concentrating its efforts on building a batch of key iron mines and ore dressing plants to meet the needs of the continuous leap forward in the steel industry.

　　This batch of mines and ore dressing plants belong to steel companies in Anshan, Wuhan, Baotou, Shijingshan, Taiyuan and other places, as well as steel enterprises in Hebei, Shanxi, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Hunan and other provinces. Some of them are responsible for the supply of ore required for this year's steel production; some are production bases for ore with high iron content that can be directly loaded into open-hearth furnaces for steelmaking; and some are engineering projects needed for next year's steel production.

　　Among these mines, the construction is fastest at the iron mine of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company. Because Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company closely relies on the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the entire company goes all out for mine construction, this mine has completed rock stripping work, built an electric locomotive railway up the mountain, and installed some ore dressing equipment since construction began at the beginning of this year. The main mining equipment, electric shovels, drilling machines, and electric locomotives have also arrived at the mine, and will soon be put into production. The ore dressing plant of Anshan Iron and Steel's Gongchangling Iron Mine is also being built relatively quickly. Most of the ore dressing equipment has been installed, and the mine is currently stepping up the construction of the electric locomotive railway up the mountain.

　　In order to strengthen mine construction work, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently conducted a comprehensive review of this year's capital construction projects, determined to concentrate efforts and adopt the method of "annihilating the enemy in batches" to accelerate the construction of this batch of key mines and ore dressing plants. At the same time, metallurgical enterprises in various places are clearing up mine equipment, construction machinery, and building materials, and have already transferred a batch of equipment and materials from them to give priority to this batch of construction projects. Anshan, Shijingshan, Taiyuan, Longyan, Wuhan and other steel companies have also organized professional mine construction teams in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry to strengthen the leadership of mine construction.

　　Since the beginning of this year, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement has been widely launched on mine construction sites in various places, which has significantly improved the mechanization level and efficiency of drilling, blasting, transportation, and other types of work; the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has also promoted the advanced "deep-hole, multi-cycle" tunneling technology and the rapid tunneling experience of the Ma Wanshui team in underground mining mines to improve the efficiency of tunneling projects. The Ma Wanshui team is a red flag in the national metallurgical mine construction, and has created twelve new national rapid tunneling records since 1950.

### 钢铁跃进　掘进当先  冶金部门新建一批重点矿山

    钢铁跃进　掘进当先
    冶金部门新建一批重点矿山
    新华社13日讯　根据国家优先发展采掘工业的方针，冶金工业部门正在集中力量，建设一批重点铁矿山和选矿厂，适应钢铁工业持续跃进的需要。
    这一批矿山和选矿厂，属于鞍山、武汉、包头、石景山、太原等钢铁公司和河北、山西、安徽、山东、河南、湖南等省的钢铁企业。它们有的担负着今年钢铁生产所需矿石的供应任务；有的是含铁量很高、可以直接装入平炉炼钢的矿石生产基地；有的是明年钢铁生产所需要的工程项目。
    在这些矿山当中，建设最快的是石景山钢铁公司的铁矿山。由于石景山钢铁公司紧紧依靠中共北京市委和中共河北省委的领导，全公司全力以赴进行矿山建设，因此这座矿山从今年年初开工建设以来，已经完成了岩石剥离工程，修通了上山的电机车铁路，安装了部分选矿设备，主要的采矿设备电铲、穿孔机和电机车也已到达矿山，不久后即将开始投入生产。鞍钢弓长岭铁矿的选矿厂也建设得比较快，大部分选矿设备已经安装好，目前这座矿山正在加紧修筑上山的电机车铁路。
    为了加强矿山建设工作，冶金工业部最近对今年的基本建设工程项目进行了全面排队，确定集中力量并采取分批“打歼灭战”的办法，加速建设这一批重点矿山和选矿厂。同时，各地冶金企业正在对矿山设备、施工机具和建筑材料进行清查，并且已经从中调剂了一批设备和材料，优先供应给这一批建设工程。鞍山、石景山、太原、龙烟、武汉等钢铁公司，还按照冶金工业部的指示，组织了专业的矿山建设队伍，加强了对矿山建设的领导。
    今年以来，各地的矿山建设工地广泛展开的技术革新和技术革命运动，已经显著地提高了凿岩、爆破、运输以及其他工种的机械化程度和效率；冶金工业部还在地下开采的矿山推广了“深眼、多循环”的先进掘进技术和马万水小组快速掘进的经验，提高井巷掘进工程的效率。马万水小组是全国冶金矿山建设的一面红旗，从1950年以来，曾创造了十二次全国快速掘进新纪录。
