Xinhua News Agency report: Shijingshan Iron & Steel Company's coal washing workers are strengthening raw coal washing and striving to increase the refined coal recovery rate. From September 1st to 12th, the amount of refined coal recovered from mud coal through flotation increased by more than 3,700 tons compared to the same period in August, and all of it was of qualified quality. This measure of recovering refined coal is of great value. If continued, it can provide the company with about 4% of its coal for coking.

The coal washing workers at this plant wash and select low-ash refined coal from a large amount of raw coal every day for use in coking. The mud coal left over after raw coal washing accounts for about 8% of the total raw coal, and contains 60% good coal. In the past, only a portion of this was recovered. During discussions of the increased production and conservation plan, the workers did a detailed calculation. If all the good coal in the mud coal could be recovered, it would not only save about 10,000 tons of raw coal per month, but also greatly reduce transportation costs and lower ironmaking costs. They actively offered suggestions and ideas, launching a surge to overcome the challenge of mud coal flotation.

Wang Shizhong, a flotation machine operator, who spends all day watching the vacuum pump of the mud coal flotation machine, is very familiar with the situation. He believed that as long as the operating vacuum pump was repaired to eliminate air leaks, the refined coal recovery volume could be increased immediately. After the leadership studied the matter and discussed it with more workers, everyone agreed that this was the most feasible solution at present. A group of workers with repair skills set to work. The next morning, the vacuum pump was repaired, and the vacuum degree improved. Previously, it could only drive one filter, but now it drives two filters. As a result, the refined coal recovered in the first shift increased from 72 tons to 217 tons, and the next shift increased to 231 tons.

After the refined coal output of the flotation machine increased, a new problem arose: the concentration of the mud coal decreased, and the flow rate was uneven, and still 10% to 15% of the good coal was lost with the water. Workers from the concentration pond, flotation machine, and filter held a meeting to study the problem, adjusted the signal contact system, and installed a 50-meter-long cast iron pipeline to guide the tailings water after flotation to a vibrating screen for a second vibration recovery. As a result, the refined coal recovered from the vibrating screen each shift also increased from about 15 tons to about 50 tons.

### 提高精煤回收率　节省原煤多炼焦　石钢洗煤工人攻打泥煤浮选关

　　提高精煤回收率　节省原煤多炼焦
　　石钢洗煤工人攻打泥煤浮选关
    新华社讯 石景山钢铁公司洗煤工人加强原煤洗选工作，千方百计提高精煤回收率，9月1日到12日仅从泥煤中浮选回收的精煤，就比8月同期增加了三千七百多吨，质量全部合格。这项回收精煤的措施价值很大，坚持下去可以为这个公司提供4％左右的炼焦用煤。
    这个厂的洗煤工人，每天都从大量原煤中洗选出低灰分的精煤用于炼焦。原煤洗选后剩下的泥煤约占原煤总量的8％，其中含有60％的好煤，过去只有部分被收回来。在讨论增产节约计划中，工人们算了细账，如果把泥煤中的好煤全部收回来，不仅一个月可以节约一万吨左右的原煤，而且大大有利于节省运输费用和降低炼铁成本。他们纷纷献策献计，掀起了一个攻打泥煤浮选关的热潮。
    浮选机工人王士中，成天看守泥煤浮选机的真空泵，很熟悉情况。他认为，只要把正在运转的一台真空泵加以修理，消除漏气现象，马上就可以提高精煤回收量。经领导上研究并同更多的工人商量后，大家认为这是当前最可行的办法，于是一批学过修理技术的工人便动手干起来。第二天早上，真空泵修好了，真空度提高，原来它只能带动一台过滤机，现在带动了两台过滤机，结果这第一班回收的精煤就由七十二吨提高到二百一十七吨，下一班又提高到二百三十一吨。
    浮选机的精煤产量提高以后，又带来了一个新问题：泥煤的浓度变低了，流量不均，仍然有10％到15％的好煤随水跑掉了。浓缩池、浮选机、过滤机的工人便一起开会研究，调整了信号联系制度，安装了一条五十米长的铸铁管道，把经过浮选以后的尾矿水引导到震动筛再进行一次震动回收，结果每班从震动筛上回收的精煤也从十五吨提高到五十吨左右。
