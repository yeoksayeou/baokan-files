Xinhua News Agency, September 15th, Buea Dispatch: In Buea, the administrative center of Southern Cameroons, two thousand Africans recently staged a demonstration against British Colonial Commissioner Field.
    Reports state that the demonstrators vehemently denounced the brutal rule of the British colonial officials and demanded the immediate removal of Field from his post.
    Reports say that the demonstration was launched by the Cameroon National Congress Party.
    Southern Cameroons is currently a British "trust territory" with a population of approximately 1.5 million. It was originally unified with the Republic of Cameroon, which gained independence earlier this year, but was later occupied and divided by Britain and France. Britain maintains a commissioner in Southern Cameroons and effectively controls all power in the country. The local people have been struggling for the independence and unification of Cameroon.

    Xinhua News Agency, September 15th, Salisbury Dispatch: Several thousand Africans in Southern Rhodesia again held a large-scale demonstration on the 14th, expressing their resolute opposition to British colonial rule.
    According to reports, on that day, Southern Rhodesian Colonial Prime Minister Whitehead intended to speak at a rally in the Highfield African township near Salisbury. However, even before the meeting began, more than two thousand African demonstrators arrived at the venue, chanting political slogans such as "Freedom!" and singing songs demanding freedom.
    The demonstrators repeatedly prevented Whitehead from speaking with their shouts for "Freedom!" In the end, the colonial prime minister had no choice but to sneak away from the meeting through the back door under the protection of a team of colonial police.
    At that moment, the colonial police, who had been deployed around the venue in advance, launched a suppression of the demonstrators. They beat the demonstrators with batons and threw tear gas. It is reported that some Africans were injured or arrested.
    However, the heroic Africans still closely pursued Whitehead, angrily attacking his car with stones.

    Xinhua News Agency, September 14th, Salisbury Dispatch: Africans in Southern Rhodesia demonstrated against Commonwealth Relations Secretary Sandys on the 12th, protesting his activities in their country.
    Reports say that on that day, as Sandys was driving from Salisbury Airport into the city of Salisbury, he was surrounded by a large number of Africans who chanted slogans at him: "Freedom!"; and said that they lived in a police state.
    The British colonial authorities in Southern Rhodesia immediately dispatched a large number of police to suppress the demonstration. They desperately beat the demonstrators with batons in an attempt to clear the way for Sandys. However, when the police forced some of the demonstrators to leave the road, others immediately swarmed up again and surrounded Sandys.

    要求独立和统一　反对英国殖民统治
    南喀麦隆两千非洲人示威
    南罗得西亚人民怒轰殖民总理和英联邦关系大臣
    新华社15日讯　布埃亚消息：在南喀麦隆行政中心布埃亚，最近爆发两千非洲人反对英国殖民专员费尔德的示威。
    消息说，示威群众大骂英国殖民官员的残暴统治，并要求立即撤除费尔德的职务。
    消息说，这次示威是喀麦隆国民大会党发动的。
    南喀麦隆现为英国“托管地”，人口约一百五十万。它与今年初独立的喀麦隆共和国原是统一的，后被英、法占领而瓜分。英国在南喀麦隆设有专员，实际上控制着这个国家的一切权力。当地人民一直在为喀麦隆的独立和统一而斗争。
    据新华社15日讯　索耳兹伯里消息：南罗得西里数千名非洲人14日再次举行大规模示威，表示坚决反对英国殖民统治。
    据报道，当天，南罗得西亚殖民总理怀特赫德打算在索耳兹伯里附近海菲耳德非洲人市镇的一次集会上讲话。但是，早在会议开始以前，两千多名非洲示威者就来到会场，高呼“自由”等政治口号，并唱起要求自由的歌曲。
    示威群众用要求“自由”的呼喊声多次阻止了企图发言的怀特赫德。最后，这个殖民总理只好在一队殖民警察的卫护下灰溜溜地从会场后门溜走。
    就在这时，预先布置在会场周围的殖民警察对示威群众展开了镇压。他们用警棍殴打示威者，并投掷了催泪弹。据报道，有一些非洲人被打伤或被捕。
    但是，英勇的非洲人仍然紧紧尾追在怀特赫德的后面，愤怒地用石块袭击他的汽车。
    新华社14日讯　索耳兹伯里消息：南罗得西亚非洲人12日向英联邦关系大臣桑迪斯举行示威，抗议他到他们国家来活动。
    消息说，当天，当桑迪斯乘车从索耳兹伯里机场进入索耳兹伯里城市时，大批非洲人包围了他，向他高呼口号：“自由！”；并说，他们生活在一个警察统治的国家。
    南罗得西亚英国殖民当局立即出动了大批警察前往镇压。他们拼命用警棍殴打示威者，企图为桑迪斯开道。但是，当警察强迫一部分示威者离开马路时其他的示威者马上又蜂涌而上，把桑迪斯包围起来。
