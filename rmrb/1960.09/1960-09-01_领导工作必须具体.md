    Leadership Work Must Be Specific
    Yuan Qing
    After a policy or work plan is determined, to turn it into reality and truly play a role in transforming the objective world, much arduous and meticulous work must be done, and many complex contradictions must be resolved. Therefore, a good leader should not be satisfied with general appeals but should often go deep into the masses and specifically guide their practical activities.
    Combining general appeals with specific guidance is a method that must be adopted in doing any work. Recently, we have seen that in resolving the issue of rationally arranging labor in rural areas, the places that have truly strengthened the agricultural front, especially the grain front, are those where leaders have adopted such a working method. They personally went deep into the communes, brigades, and even production teams and small production teams to investigate and study the use of labor and find ways to rationally arrange labor. Comrade Song Yaxin, First Secretary of the CPC Danyang County Committee, personally went deep into two brigades of the Dabo Commune and various departments of the commune to conduct investigations and studies on the use of labor from all aspects. He found that because the Party Committee of the commune and the leading cadres of the Dagon Brigade were not clear enough about the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation, the use of labor was relatively dispersed; at the same time, due to the imperfect systems in some departments, there was a considerable waste of labor. This shows that to rationally solve the problem of labor arrangement and use, it is necessary to conduct ideological education for cadres on the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation and grain as the foundation of the foundation, concentrating labor as much as possible on field work; all undertakings and enterprises must improve their management, establish and improve the responsibility system, and avoid idling and waste of labor. According to these principles, Comrade Song Yaxin specifically helped the Dabo Commune and the Dagon Brigade to rearrange labor, which not only guaranteed the needs of agricultural production as a priority but also allowed the needed community-run industries to continue to operate, and even operate better than before. After the experience created by Comrade Song Yaxin below was promoted throughout the county, it greatly promoted the rational arrangement of labor in the county.
    It can be seen from this incident that there are many benefits to leading cadres going down to implement specific leadership. First, they can discover and solve problems in a timely manner, provide practical and specific assistance to grassroots cadres, and promptly promote successful experiences. The vast majority of our grassroots cadres are loyal and want to do their jobs well; however, due to limitations in their level of understanding and policy, some comrades may inevitably fail to grasp the center, or lack methods. For example, the reason why the leading force of Dabo Commune and Dagon Brigade was too dispersed and the use of labor was not concentrated was because the ideological understanding of the cadres had not been able to adapt to the changes in the objective situation, and they did not fully understand the great significance of implementing the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and grain as the key link. Comrade Song Yaxin went deep down, revealed the contradictions through systematic investigation and research, grasped the materials, carried out persuasive education for them, and rearranged the labor with them, which was very practical help for them. Moreover, promoting the experience created by Comrade Song Yaxin in this commune and brigade is also a kind of help to other communes and brigades, at least it will play a role of reference. Second, it is possible to implement the Party's policies in a manner appropriate to the time and place, and avoid the problem of generalized leadership. The Party's policies are a profound reflection of the laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country, and their basic spirit and main practices are applicable to all places, and therefore should be carefully studied, researched and implemented; it is wrong not to do so and will commit principled errors that lead to disorientation. However, the universality of contradiction is contained in the particularity of contradiction; the same problem often has different manifestations at different times, in different places, and under different conditions, and therefore there should be different solutions. Therefore, in order to rationally use labor throughout the county and better implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, the CPC Danyang County Committee should carefully study the situation in the region. The CPC Danyang County Committee, based on the situation and experience provided by Comrade Song Yaxin, the first secretary of the county party committee, after going down to "dissect the sparrow", and after full research and discussion, finally affirmed the specific methods for labor arrangement in the county. Needless to say, the work plan formulated in this way can better implement the instructions of the higher authorities and properly solve the problem. Third, it can enable leaders to have a clear understanding of the situation, so that the leadership work can truly proceed from reality, make correct judgments on problems, and avoid following others blindly, swaying from left to right, and causing the phenomenon of neglecting one thing while attending to another. It is not difficult to imagine that if Comrade Song Yaxin had not personally gone down to "dissect the sparrow", and had not thoroughly and comprehensively revealed the contradictions, he would not have been able to both highlight the guarantee of key points, so that more than 80% of the commune's labor force was used for agricultural production, and take care of the general, so that diversified economies could continue to develop, in helping Dabo Commune solve the problem of rational use of labor.
    Through the Party's long-term education and learning in practice, the vast majority of our comrades can generally combine general appeals with specific guidance, and in the process of implementing the Party's policies, transform principles into concrete things. Especially since the recent widespread promotion of the "two-five system" leadership method in various places, many local leading cadres often go deep into the fields, workshops, and construction sites after collectively studying and formulating a work plan, participating in labor on the one hand and helping grassroots cadres solve specific problems on the other, and summarizing and promoting experiences anytime and anywhere. As a result, problems are solved in a timely manner, experiences are promoted rapidly, and the development of production and work is changing with each passing day. However, there are still some comrades who are more likely to make general appeals and arrangements than to provide specific guidance. They are still more accustomed to sitting in the office than to going deep into the grassroots to specifically study the situation and solve problems. The reason why these comrades are like this is mainly because some ideological problems have not been well resolved.
    Some comrades believe that attending meetings, listening to reports, and reading reports can also understand the actual situation and carry out specific leadership. It is true that certain meetings, reports, and reports are indispensable, but more important is that leading cadres should go deep into reality themselves and personally obtain first-hand materials. Because by doing so, they can not only discover important problems that cannot be discovered in meetings and reports, but also solve urgent problems that need to be solved in the fields, on the sides of the fields, in the canteens, by the stoves, and in the wells in a timely manner. At the same time, because they go deep into a point themselves and specifically understand the situation of this point, they can better use the situation reflected by meetings, reports, etc., to better combine the point and the surface.
    Some comrades also believe that the responsibility of leaders is to grasp the overall situation and guide the overall work, and that going deep into a point to do specific work will grab the point and lose the surface. This view is also wrong. It should be known that the purpose of leading cadres going deep into the front line and going deep into a certain point is not only to do a good job at this point, but to break through a point, gain experience, and use it to guide the overall work. For example, Comrade Song Yaxin went deep into Dabo Commune not only to help this commune solve the problem of rational labor arrangement, but more importantly, to guide the county's labor arrangement work by "dissecting" the "small sparrow" of Dabo Commune. Without adopting this method of combining the general and the specific, it is impossible to guide the overall work well. Because without an in-depth investigation and research of a point, and with only a general understanding of the situation, it is impossible to deeply reveal the internal contradictions of things, and it is impossible to come up with practical and effective methods to solve the contradictions. In some places, leading cadres spend two or three days "squatting" and "dissecting sparrows" to create experience in the five days of going deep into grassroots work in a week, and use the remaining time to "turn the surface" to understand the situation and inspect the work. Facts have proved that doing so is not grabbing the point and losing the surface. On the contrary, it is precisely because of grabbing the point that we can better grab the surface. If we don't grab the point, because we don't have an in-depth understanding of the situation and the guidance to the work is not specific, the result will be a real loss of face.
    Some comrades are also concerned that leading cadres going deep into the grassroots to specifically guide the activities of the masses will make them fall into事務主義 [petty concerns with routine tasks], and will relax the political and ideological leadership of the masses. In fact, this worry is completely unnecessary. Leading cadres going deep into a point, grasping specific work, investigating and researching the situation with a purpose and plan, and personally solving some urgent problems that need to be solved in production and work, this is not only not事務主義, on the contrary, it is precisely to effectively implement the Party's policies and better realize the political and ideological leadership of the masses. It should be known that doing political and ideological work for the masses cannot be done without combining the ideological situation of the masses and without combining the solution of specific problems; doing political and ideological work in this way has no vitality, and the masses will not be interested in it. Comrade Mao Zedong once said that doing political and ideological work for peasants "must be done very specifically and meticulously based on the life experience of the peasants" and "must be combined with economic work." And to do political and ideological work in this way, leading cadres must go deep into the grassroots, not only working and living with the masses, but also personally solving some problems that seem trivial but are actually very important. In this way, they will find it easier to discover the common ideological situations among grassroots cadres and the masses, and find ways that are easily accepted by grassroots cadres and the masses to solve their ideological problems, so as to better implement the Party's policies and transform them into the actions of the masses.
    The Party has always emphasized that cadres should go deep into reality and deep into the masses, and now it continues to emphasize that cadres should go deep into the front line of production. The purpose is to make cadres take specific leadership; because only in this way can the Party's policies be transformed into the specific actions of the masses in a timely manner. It can be seen that whether leadership is specific is the key to realizing the Party's policies, the key to completing the Party's various work tasks, and the key to improving the work style of cadres. Party cadres should carefully study and master this leadership art and should not take it lightly.

    领导工作必须具体
    远青
    一项方针政策或工作计划确定之后，要把它变成现实，真正起到改造客观世界的作用，还必须做许多艰苦的细致的工作，解决许多错综复杂的矛盾。因此，一个好的领导者，不应当满足于一般的号召，而应当经常深入到群众中去，具体地指导群众的实践活动。
    把一般号召和具体指导结合起来，这是做任何工作都必须采取的方法。最近我们就看到，在解决农村合理安排劳动力的问题上，凡是真正加强了农业战线、特别是粮食战线的地方，都是因为领导者采取了这样的工作方法。他们亲自深入到公社、大队以至生产队和生产小队去，调查研究劳动力的使用状况，寻找合理安排劳动力的办法。中共丹阳县委第一书记宋亚欣同志，就曾经亲自深入到大泊公社的两个大队和公社的各部门，从各方面对劳动力的使用情况作了调查研究。他发现，由于这个公社的党委和大贡大队的领导干部，对以农业为基础的思想不够明确，因而在劳动力的使用上比较分散；同时由于一些部门的制度不健全，有相当严重的浪费劳动力的现象。这就说明，为要合理解决劳动力的安排和使用问题，必须对干部进行以农业为基础而粮食又是基础的基础的思想教育，尽可能地把劳动力集中使用到田间劳动上；必须使一切事业和企业部门改善经营管理，建立和健全责任制度，避免在劳动力使用上的窝工和浪费现象。宋亚欣同志按照这样的原则，具体地帮助大泊公社和大贡大队重新安排了劳动力，结果既重点地保证了农业生产的需要，又使需要办的社办工业等能够继续办下去，而且办得比以前还要好。宋亚欣同志在下面创造的这个经验在全县推广以后，对全县合理安排劳动力起了很大的推动作用。
    从这件事可以看出，领导干部深入下去实行具体领导，好处是很多的。第一，能够及时发现问题和解决问题，给予基层干部以切实具体的帮助，并能及时地推广成功的经验。我们的基层干部，绝大多数都是忠心耿耿，想把工作作好的；但是由于认识水平和政策水平的限制，有些同志有时难免把握不住中心，或者缺少办法。例如，大泊公社和大贡大队的领导力量所以过于分散，劳动力的使用不集中，就是因为干部的思想认识没有能够适应客观情况的变化，还不十分懂得实行以农业为基础、以粮为纲的方针的重大意义。宋亚欣同志深入下去，通过系统的调查研究，揭发了矛盾，掌握了材料，对他们进行了说服教育，又和他们一起重新安排了劳动力，这对他们就是非常切实的帮助。而且把宋亚欣同志在这个公社和大队创造的经验推广出去，对其他公社和大队也是一种帮助，至少会起借鉴的作用。第二，可以因时因地制宜地贯彻执行党的方针政策，避免领导工作一般化的毛病。党的方针政策是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的规律性的深刻反映，其基本精神和主要的作法对各个地方都是适用的，因而应当认真地学习、研究和执行；不这样作是不对的，会犯迷失方向的原则性错误。但是，矛盾的普遍性是寓于矛盾的特殊性之中的；同样一个问题，在不同的时间、不同的地点和不同的条件下，往往有不同的表现形式，因而也就应该有不同的解决方法。因此，中共丹阳县委为要做到在全县合理地使用劳动力，更好地执行以农业为基础的方针，就应当认真地研究本地区的情况。中共丹阳县委就是根据县委第一书记宋亚欣同志深入下去“解剖麻雀”以后提供的情况和经验，又经过充分的研究讨论以后，才最后肯定了全县劳动力安排的具体办法。不用说，这样制定的工作方案，更能正确地贯彻执行上级的指示，妥善地解决问题。第三，可以使领导者心中有数，使领导工作真正做到从实际出发，对问题做出正确的判断，而不至人云亦云，左右摇摆，发生顾此失彼的现象。不难设想，如果宋亚欣同志没有亲自深入下去“解剖麻雀”，没有深入地全面地把矛盾揭发出来，他在帮助大泊公社解决合理使用劳动力的问题上，就不可能做到既突出地保证了重点，使全公社80％以上的劳动力用于农业生产，又照顾了一般，使多种经济能够继续发展。
    经过党的长期的教育和在实践中学习，我们的绝大多数同志，一般都能做到把一般号召和具体指导结合起来，在执行党的方针政策的过程中，把原则的东西化为具体的东西。特别是最近各地普遍推行“二五制”领导方法以来，许多地方的领导干部，常常是在集体研究制定一项工作计划以后，随着就深入到地头、车间和工地，一面参加劳动，一面帮助基层干部解决具体问题，随时随地总结推广经验。因而问题解决得及时，经验推广得迅速，生产和工作的发展也就日新月异。但是，也还有一些同志是一般号召和布置多于具体指导，他们仍然比较习惯于坐办公室，而不习惯于深入基层具体研究情况，具体解决问题。这些同志所以这样，主要是思想上有些问题还没有很好地解决。
    有些同志认为，开会、听汇报、看报告，同样可以了解实际情况，同样可以进行具体领导。不错，一定的会议、汇报、报告是不可少的，但更重要的，还是领导干部要自己深入实际，亲自去搞第一手的材料。因为这样作，不但可以发现在会议和汇报中发现不了的重要问题，而且可以及时地在田头、地边、食堂、炉旁、井下解决迫切需要解决的问题。同时由于自己深入一个点，具体地了解了这个点的情况，就能更好地利用会议、汇报等所反映面的情况，使点和面更好地结合起来。
    也有一些同志认为，领导的责任是掌握全面情况，指导全面工作，而深入一点做具体工作，就会抓了点而丢了面。这种看法也是错误的。要知道，领导干部深入第一线，深入到某一个点去，目的绝不仅仅是搞好这个点的工作，而是为了突破一点，取得经验，用以指导全面工作。如宋亚欣同志深入到大泊公社去，不单是为了帮助这个公社解决合理安排劳动力的问题，更重要的是为了通过对大泊公社这个
  “小麻雀”的解剖，来指导全县劳动力安排的工作。不采用这种一般和具体结合的方法，要想指导好全面的工作也是不可能的。因为没有对一点的深入的调查研究，对情况只限于一般的了解，就不可能深刻地揭示事物发展的内在矛盾，不可能拿出解决矛盾的切实有效的方法。有些地方的领导干部，在一周内深入基层工作的五天中，用两天或三天“蹲点”，“解剖麻雀”，创造经验，用其余的时间“转面”，了解情况，检查工作。事实证明，这样作不是抓了点，丢了面，相反，正因为抓了点，才能更好地抓面。要是不去抓点，由于对情况了解不深入，对工作指导不具体，其结果才会真正丢了面。
    还有一些同志耽心，领导干部深入基层具体指导群众的活动，会使他们陷入事务主义，会放松了对群众的政治思想领导。其实，这种耽心也是完全不必要的。领导干部深入一点，抓具体工作，有目的有计划地调查研究情况，亲自动手解决一些生产和工作中迫切需要解决的问题，这不但不是事务主义，恰恰相反，正是为了切实有效地贯彻执行党的方针政策，更好地实现对群众的政治思想领导。要知道，对群众做政治思想工作，不结合群众的思想情况，不结合解决具体问题是不行的；这样做政治思想工作是没有生命力的，群众是不会对它产生兴趣的。毛泽东同志就曾经说过，对农民做政治思想工作，“必须根据农民的生活经验，很具体很细致地去做”，并且“要结合着经济工作一道去做”。而要这样做政治思想工作，领导干部就必须深入基层，不但要和群众一起劳动、一起生活，而且要亲自动手解决一些看来很琐碎、实际很重要的问题。这样，他们就会比较容易发现基层干部和群众中带有普遍性的思想情况，就会找到容易为基层干部和群众接受的方式，来解决他们的思想认识问题，从而更好地把党的方针政策贯彻下去，化为群众的行动。
    党一贯强调干部要深入实际，深入群众，目前又继续强调干部要深入生产第一线，其目的就是要干部作具体的领导；因为只有这样，才能把党的方针政策及时地变成群众的具体行动。由此可见，领导是否具体，是实现党的方针政策的关键问题，是完成党的各项工作任务的关键问题，也是改进干部作风的关键问题。党的干部应该认真学习和掌握这一领导艺术，千万不要等闲视之。
