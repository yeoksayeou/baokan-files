Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, 2nd -- Following the people's protests and public condemnation of the government's manipulation of the lower house elections, the King of Iran was forced on the 1st to announce the election results invalid.

A decree issued by the King demanded that the already "elected" members of parliament resign in order to clear the way for new elections.

In this "election" farce, the Iranian government used various means such as bloody suppression and fraud to manipulate the "election." During the election, there were several large-scale bloody incidents. Former Prime Minister Eghbal, who was directly responsible for these crimes, has already resigned under pressure from public opinion.

Prior to the issuance of this decree, one hundred and fifty-four members of parliament had been "elected," of which Eghbal's National Party occupied one hundred and four seats.

In order to continue to control future elections, the decree stated that a special group will be appointed by the King to draft amendments to the election law.

At the same time, Eghbal's National Party called on its members to "energetically participate in the new election."

    在人民示威抗议和舆论压力下
    伊朗国王被迫宣布选举无效
    新华社2日讯　德黑兰消息：伊朗国王在人民抗议和舆论谴责政府操纵下议院的选举后，在1日被迫宣布选举结果无效。
    国王发布的一项文告要求已经“当选”的议员辞职，以便为举行新选举扫清道路。
    在这次“选举”丑剧中，伊朗政府曾使用了血腥镇压、舞弊等种种手段来操纵“选举”。在选举期间曾发生大规模流血事件多起。对这些罪行直接负责的前首相埃格巴尔已经在舆论压力下辞职。
    在发布这项文告前，已有一百五十四名议员“当选”，其中埃格巴尔的国家党占一百零四名。
    为了继续控制未来的选举，文告说，将由国王任命一个特别小组来草拟选举法的修正案。
    同时，埃格巴尔的国家党要求它的党员“重新精力充沛地参加新选举”。
