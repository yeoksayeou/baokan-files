    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 31st: According to a broadcast from Vientiane Radio this noon, Captain Koum Le, Chairman of the Lao Coup Committee, issued a proclamation to the entire nation today, exposing the fact that ministers of the extremely pro-American and reactionary former Chao Somsanith government have infiltrated the new government established in Luang Prabang on August 30th, and called on the Lao people to fight against them.
    The proclamation to the entire nation stated that this newly established government still includes some ministers from the former Chao Somsanith government, such as Phoumi Nosavan, Inpeng Souryathay, Nhoui Abhay, Kou Voravong, and Leuam Insixiengmay. The proclamation stated, "They have caused the country to decline, created bloodshed, and caused the deaths of countless guerrillas, soldiers, and people. Now, they are stubbornly clinging to their seats. These traitors are well aware that our people across the country dislike them, so they are trying every means to infiltrate the new government. If we allow these puppets and traitors to participate in the government (which the people do not want), they will soon regain power and re-launch a civil war. Therefore, as our people who love the motherland, love religion, love the royal court, love peace, and love justice, we must all rise up and struggle to eliminate the traitorous puppets, sweep them away, and drive them out of our beloved motherland. Compatriots, stand up! The time has come, we must rise up and fight for the freedom, fairness, security, and happiness of our motherland."
    The proclamation to the entire nation stated, "Our coup committee vows to serve the motherland and defend the peace and happiness of the people. We will fight to the final victory, just as we promised our compatriots on the day we launched the coup. As long as our compatriots continue to support us, we will not be defeated by them."
    Koum Le also said in the proclamation to the entire nation, "I deeply understand that the people have a desire for peace, happiness, and fairness. We will do what the majority of the people want. The current era is an era of democracy. Therefore, we call on all compatriots to stand up and fight to realize their earnest wishes."
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 31st: According to a broadcast from Vientiane Radio this noon, Captain Koum Le, Chairman of the Lao Coup Committee, sent a telegram from Vientiane to Lao Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma in Luang Prabang, requesting that Phoumi Nosavan and Inpeng Souryathay be excluded from the new government.
    According to the list of the new government announced by Souvanna Phouma, Phoumi Nosavan serves as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior, Culture, and Social Welfare in the new government, and Inpeng Souryathay, the former Minister of Finance of the Somsanith government, also serves as Minister of Finance in the new government.
    Koum Le said in the telegram, "For the sake of the country's interests, you can: either eliminate our eight hundred soldiers; or exclude the above two people from the government."
    Koum Le requested in the telegram the establishment of a new cabinet without the above two people, and said, "If you feel difficulty or are under pressure, I ask you to refuse and not establish a new government."

    老挝政变委员会主席贡勒发表告人民书
    号召人民起来消灭卖国贼
    致电富马坚决反对诺萨万混入新政府
    新华社河内31日电　据万象电台今天中午广播，老挝政变委员会主席贡勒大尉今天在告全民书中，揭露极端亲美反动的前昭·松萨尼特政府的大臣们混入8月30日在琅勃拉邦成立的新政府，并且号召老挝人民同他们作斗争。
    告全民书说，这个新成立的政府仍然包括前昭·松萨尼特政府的一些大臣，如富米·诺萨万、因彭·苏里亚泰、努义·阿贝、库·沃拉冯和仑·英锡相迈等。告全民书说，“他们曾经使国家衰落，制造了流血，使不知多少游击队员、士兵和人民死亡。现在，他们又顽固地死赖着他们的席位。这些卖国贼都清楚地知道我们全国人民不喜欢他们，因此，他们想尽办法混入新政府。如果我们让这些傀儡和卖国贼参加政府（这是人民所不愿意的），不久他们就会恢复权柄，重新发动内战。因此，作为爱祖国、爱宗教、爱皇廷、爱和平和爱正义的我国人民，必须一齐起来斗争，把卖国的傀儡消灭掉，把他们扫清和赶出我们亲爱的祖国。同胞们站起来吧！是时候了，我们必须起来，为争取祖国的自由、公平、安全和幸福而斗争。”
    告全民书说，“我们政变委员会誓为祖国服务，保卫人民的安宁和幸福。我们将像在发动政变那天曾经向同胞保证的那样，一直斗争到最后的胜利为止。只要同胞们继续支持我们，我们就不会为他们打败。”
    贡勒在告全民书中又说，“我深刻地理解人民具有和平、幸福、公平的愿望。大多数人民的愿望是什么，我们就做什么。现今的时代是民主时代。因此，我们号召全体同胞站起来为实现自己的殷切的愿望而斗争。”
    新华社河内31日电　据万象电台今天中午广播，老挝政变委员会主席贡勒大尉从万象打电报给在琅勃拉邦的老挝首相富马亲王，要求把富米·诺萨万和因彭·苏里亚泰这两个人从新政府中排除出去。
    据富马所宣布的新政府的名单，富米·诺萨万在新政府中担任副首相兼内政、文化和社会福利大臣，前松萨尼特政府的财政大臣因彭·苏里亚泰也在新政府中担任财政大臣。
    贡勒在电报中说，“为了国家的利益，你可以：或者把我们八百名士兵消灭掉；或者把上述两个人从政府中排除出去。”
    贡勒在电报中要求成立没有上述两个人的新内阁，并且说，“如果你感到困难或者受到压力的话，我要求你加以拒绝，不要成立新政府”。
