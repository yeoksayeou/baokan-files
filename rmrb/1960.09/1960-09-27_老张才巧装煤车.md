　　A Heartfelt Dedication to Steelmaking

　　Old Zhang Cai Skillfully Loads Coal Cars
　　In the Shijiazhuang Locomotive Depot, there is an old driver named Zhang Cai. Although he is over fifty, he works even better than a young lad. He is responsible for transporting coal to stations like Xin'jing and Fengshan. He works steadily, accurately, and nimbly, and his comrades call him an old hero.
　　Since the Shijiazhuang Office Party Committee issued the call to "Guarantee steel production through coal transportation and complete the annual transportation task one month ahead of schedule," Old Hero thought to himself, "Without coal, steel cannot be made. I am the one who transports the coal, so this responsibility is truly heavy!"
　　One night, in the Fengshan Station operations room, the duty officer was busy, as train number 2850 had to depart at exactly 3:00 AM. Now, there was still one hour before departure. However, the rolling stock for 2850 had not yet arrived. Switchman Old Xue glanced at the wall clock and said, "If Old Hero Zhang Cai, driving the Liberation-type 3416, were driving today, we would be guaranteed to depart on time." As soon as he finished speaking, train number 2571 entered the station, and the driver was none other than Old Zhang Cai. The young men immediately beamed with joy, and Old Xue ran to the locomotive in three steps and told Zhang Cai about the situation. When Old Zhang Cai heard that the train would affect the 'dragon' train if it didn't depart within an hour, he quickly said, "Old Xue, don't worry, I guarantee we'll get the train out within an hour!"
　　A battle to seize time and race against the clock began. As the red light flashed, Zhang Cai applied the brakes precisely, and the train stopped right in front of the coal loading dock. The coal loaders, seeing this, said in unison, "It's Old Zhang Cai today. Look at his steady and accurate skill. There's no problem with departing on time." Thirty-five empty cars were loaded in thirty minutes. At this critical moment, another problem arose – the order was wrong. However, they were afraid that re-arranging them would cause a delay. What to do? Old Xue was truly scratching his head. But Old Hero Zhang Cai had a steady idea and quickly said, "Re-arrange!" As the green light flashed, the train was rearranged in just fifteen minutes. Old Xue looked at the clock, shook Old Hero's hand and said, "You truly live up to your reputation! From arrival to departure, it only took fifty minutes."
　　The dawn of the East emerged, and train number 2850 departed from Fengshan Station, a train fully loaded with industrial food – coal – speeding towards the steel mill. (Jing Tie)

　　老张才巧装煤车
    石家庄机务段有个老司机，名叫张才。别看他五十多岁，干起活来，真是赛过青年小伙子。他担任着新井、凤山等站的运煤任务。干起活来稳、准、俐落，同志们都叫他老英雄。
    自从石家庄办事处党委提出“以运煤保证钢铁生产、提前一个月完成全年运输任务”的号召后，老英雄心想：“没有煤，就炼不出钢。自己就是运煤的，这担子可真不轻啊！”
    一个夜晚，在凤山站运转室里，值班员正忙碌着，三点整二八五零次车就得开出去。现在离开车还有一小时。可是，二八五零次的车底还没有到。调车员老薛瞅了瞅挂表说：“今天要是解放型三四一六的老英雄开车，保证能正点开车。”话音刚落，二五七一次列车进站了，开车的正是老张才。小伙子们顿时眉开颜笑，老薛三步并做二步跑到机车上，把这事告诉了张才。老张才听说这趟车在一小时之内开不出去就会影响龙车，连忙说：“老薛，放心吧，保证在一小时之内把车开出去！”
    一场争时间、抢分秒的战斗开始了。红灯一闪，张才一把闸不偏不倚，火车正对准上煤仓。装煤工一见这情景，异口同声地说：“今天是老张才，你看这个稳准劲儿，正点开出没问题。”三十五辆空车，三十分钟就装完了。在这节骨眼上，又生了枝节——顺序不对。可是，重新编又怕到点开不出去。怎么办？老薛可真有点搔头。还是老英雄张才主意稳，连忙说：“重编！”绿灯一晃，只用了十五分钟，列车就编完了。老薛看了看表，握住老英雄的手说：“真是名不虚传啊！从到达至开出，只用了五十分钟。”
    东方露出了黎明的曙光，二八五零次列车驶出了凤山站，一列满载工业食粮——煤的列车，朝钢铁厂疾驰而去。　（京铁）
