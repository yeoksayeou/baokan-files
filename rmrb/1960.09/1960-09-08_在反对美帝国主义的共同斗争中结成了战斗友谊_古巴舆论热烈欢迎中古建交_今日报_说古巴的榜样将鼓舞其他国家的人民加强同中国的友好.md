Xinhua News Agency, Havana, September 6th. The Cuban newspaper "Hoy" published an editorial today, expressing warm support for the Cuban People's National Assembly's decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. The editorial pointed out that the Cuban people's decision to do so is another exercise of the complete sovereignty that Cuba has recovered.

The editorial pointed out that the vast masses of the Cuban people warmly and unanimously agreed with Prime Minister Castro's opinion on establishing diplomatic relations with China, which demonstrates the feelings of the Cuban people.

The editorial emphasized that there are many reasons in history for the Cuban and Chinese people to unite. The editorial mentioned the suffering of the Cuban and Chinese people under the oppression of U.S. imperialism and the common struggle for independence.

The editorial said that the People's Republic of China has always been a consistent ally and friend of Cuba and the Cuban people; while Chiang Kai-shek, as a docile tool of imperialist aggressors, has always been an ally and supporter of the Batista tyrannical rule.

The editorial pointed out that when Cuba was struggling to liberate itself from the rule of Batista and Washington, who supported Batista, People's China repeatedly expressed its support for the Cuban people. After the victory of the Cuban Revolution, People's China continued to provide assistance. The editorial said that the leaders of the Chinese government have repeatedly expressed their determination to provide all possible assistance to the Cuban people, which will be recorded in gold letters in the history of friendship. China's purchase of 500,000 tons of sugar is only one manifestation of this determination. In this regard, the editorial emphasized the unwavering stance of Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Premier Zhou Enlai in their speeches, expressing the firm support of the Chinese people for the struggle of the Cuban people.

The editorial then refuted the shameless slanders made by the U.S. imperialist newspapers about the relations between China and Cuba.

The editorial pointed out that China is not seeking any bridgehead in Latin America. The editorial said that this slander by the U.S. newspapers shows how afraid U.S. imperialism is that the chains of fear imposed by Washington on the governments of Latin American countries will be broken. The editorial pointed out that Cuba's example will encourage people in other countries to demand an end to the abnormal situation in their countries' relations with the People's Republic of China.

The editorial concluded, "The real China and the real Cuba are meeting together for the first time today. Like all Cubans, we excitedly congratulate this historic meeting."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, September 6th. The Cuban Workers' Confederation newspaper "Trabajadores Vanguardia" published an editorial saying that the decision of the Cuban People's National Assembly to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China officially affirmed the relationship that has existed since the victory of the revolution.

The editorial, entitled "We Pay Tribute to China," said, "Despite the distance and language barriers between us, the Cuban people have always felt the warm friendship and support of the people of the People's Republic of China."

The editorial concluded by saying that the Cuban working class, through its highest body, expresses "sincere and enthusiastic respect" to the heroic China, the China of Mao Zedong.

In another commentary, "Trabajadores Vanguardia" pointed out that the Cuban people feel the greatest honor in that, regardless of prejudice and slander, across oceans and mountains, they have finally reached out to firmly grasp the hands of the heroic Chinese people. The commentary pointed out that the Cuban people understand and respect the Chinese people, just as the Chinese people have been with them in the Cuban people's struggle for the right to survival.

"Hoy" published a congratulatory telegram from the Laundry and Ironing Workers' Union today, which said, "We extend our hand of friendship to the Chinese people and workers. With the formal establishment of relations between the revolutionary government and the People's Republic of China, our common struggle against the enemies of all peoples, U.S. imperialism, will be strengthened and consolidated."

"Hoy" published almost an entire page of pictures of China's economic construction achievements on the fifth page. The headline is: "Cuba Shakes Hands with a Great Nation, the People's Republic of China."

    在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中结成了战斗友谊
    古巴舆论热烈欢迎中古建交
    “今日报”说古巴的榜样将鼓舞其他国家的人民加强同中国的友好
    新华社哈瓦那6日电　古巴“今日报”今天发表社论，表示热烈拥护古巴人民全国大会关于同中华人民共和国建立外交关系的决定。社论指出，古巴人民作出这项决定是再次行使古巴已经收回的完全的主权。
    社论指出，古巴广大群众热烈地一致同意卡斯特罗总理关于同中国建交的意见，这件事表明了古巴人民的感情。
    社论强调指出，在历史上有很多理由使古巴人民和中国人民团结在一起。社论谈到古巴人民和中国人民在美帝国主义压迫下曾经遭受的痛苦和为争取独立而进行的共同斗争。
    社论说，中华人民共和国是古巴和古巴人民的一贯的同盟者和朋友；而蒋介石作为帝国主义侵略者的顺从工具，一贯是巴蒂斯塔暴政统治的盟友和支持者。
    社论指出，当古巴为了从巴蒂斯塔和支持巴蒂斯塔的华盛顿的统治下解放自己而斗争的时候，人民中国一再地表示了对古巴人民的支援。在古巴革命胜利后，人民中国继续不断地进行支援。社论说，中国政府的领导人一再表示他们决定向古巴人民提供一切可能的援助，这种态度将以金色的大字载入友谊的史册。中国购买的五十万吨糖仅是这种决定的一个表现。在这方面，社论着重谈到刘少奇主席和周恩来总理在他们发表的谈话中表示的中国人民坚决支持古巴人民的斗争的坚定不移的立场。
    社论接着驳斥了美帝国主义的报纸对古中两国关系进行的无耻诬蔑。
    社论指出，中国并没有在拉丁美洲寻求任何桥头堡。社论说，美国报纸的这种诬蔑表明，美帝国主义是何等地害怕华盛顿强加于拉丁美洲各国政府的恐惧的锁链将被打断。社论指出，古巴的榜样将鼓舞其他国家的人民要求终止他们的国家在同中华人民共和国的关系上存在的不正常情况。
    社论最后说，“真正的中国同真正的古巴今天第一次会合在一起了。同所有的古巴人一样，我们兴奋地祝贺这一历史性的会合。”
    新华社哈瓦那6日电　古巴工人联合会机关报“工人先锋报”发表社论说，古巴人民全国大会关于和中华人民共和国建立外交关系的决定，在外交上正式肯定了从革命胜利起就已存在着的关系。
  这篇题为“我们向中国致敬”的社论说，“尽管我们相距遥远并存在着语言上的障碍，古巴人民一直感到中华人民共和国人民对我们的热烈的友谊和支持”。
    社论最后说，古巴工人阶级通过它的最高机构向英勇的中国、毛泽东的中国表示“真诚和热情的敬意”。
    “工人先锋报”在另一篇评论中指出，古巴人民感到最大的荣誉的是他们不顾偏见和诽谤的大洋和高山，终于伸出手来紧握着英勇的中国人民的手。评论指出，古巴人民了解中国人民，并且尊重他们，正如中国人民在古巴人民争取生存权利的斗争中同他们在一起一样。
    “今日报”今天发表了洗衣和烫衣工人工会的贺电，贺电说，“我们向中国人民和工人们伸出我们友谊的手。随着革命政府和中华人民共和国正式建立关系，我们对各国人民的敌人、美帝国主义的共同斗争将得到加强和巩固”。
    “今日报”在第五版几乎整版刊登了中国经济建设成就的图片。标题是：“古巴和一个伟大的国家中华人民共和国握手”。
