Wishing the Vietnamese people brilliant victory. Wishing the eternal friendship between China and Vietnam.
Party and state leaders Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, etc. attended the meeting, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Ambassador Chen Ziping, and Delegation Leader Chen Huiliao spoke
A joint celebration was held in the Great Hall of the People, with hosts and guests jointly celebrating the strong unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

On September 2nd, it was the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. More than 1,500 people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand gathering at the CPPCC Auditorium this morning to warmly celebrate the glorious festival of the Vietnamese people.

Party and state leaders Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Peng Zhen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Bo Yibo, and Xi Zhongxun attended the meeting.

Chen Ziping, Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, the Vietnam-China Friendship Association delegation headed by Chen Huiliao, the Mock Drama Art Troupe of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam headed by Wu Qiu and Gao Jindian, and the delegation of the Vietnam Academy of Letters headed by Huai Qing, attended the meeting as distinguished guests. The Vietnamese guests were warmly welcomed by the masses from all walks of life who attended the meeting.

Today, the CPPCC Auditorium presented a joyful festive scene. On the curtain in the center of the rostrum of the conference, the national flags of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam were hung side by side, with the golden characters "1945-1960" hanging on both sides. Large banners were hung inside and outside the venue: "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and Vietnam!" "Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!"

The meeting began with the solemn playing of the national anthems of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China.

Bo Yibo，Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, spoke, expressing the warmest congratulations on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people to the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the fraternal Vietnamese people.

He said that under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the industrious and brave Vietnamese people, with their strong revolutionary will and selfless labor enthusiasm, have worked hard and advanced along the road of socialist revolution and socialist construction. He talked about the great achievements made by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in socialist construction. He said: The fraternal Vietnamese people will surely be able to achieve even more brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction in the years to come.

Bo Yibo pointed out that the people of South Vietnam under the dark rule of U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet regime are still threatened by unemployment, poverty, hunger, and persecution, which is in sharp contrast to North Vietnam. He said that the frantic struggles of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs cannot save them from their inevitable final fate. The Vietnamese people's desire for peaceful reunification of their motherland will surely be realized, and the 650 million Chinese people will always support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people until they achieve final victory.

Bo Yibo said that China and Vietnam are both peace-loving countries. Our two countries have always pursued a foreign policy of peace, and have made unremitting efforts to achieve peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, ease international tensions, and defend peace in Asia and the world. He condemned the crimes of U.S. imperialism in undermining the Geneva Accords and using the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to continuously carry out military threats, subversion and sabotage activities against the Indochina countries. He also pointed out that the United States is intensifying its interference in Laos' internal affairs through its vassal states in an attempt to prevent Laos from taking the path of peace and neutrality. He said: China and Vietnam's position of maintaining peace in Indochina is firm and unshakeable, and the will of the people of Indochina to oppose foreign interference and safeguard national independence cannot be shaken by any force. No matter what conspiratorial methods U.S. imperialism adopts, its plan of aggression against Indochina is doomed to failure.

Bo Yibo said that U.S. imperialism's evil activities in Indochina are an integral part of its overall policy of war and aggression. Recently, the United States is adopting methods similar to those it adopted in Indochina, and is stepping up its aggression and expansion against African and Latin American countries, especially the Congo and Cuba. On the one hand, the United States is clamoring about the so-called Soviet and Chinese infiltration into Africa, while on the other hand, it is using the signboard of the United Nations to openly and brazenly interfere in the internal affairs of the Congo, infringe upon the sovereignty of the Congo, and attempt to replace the Belgian colonialists to re-enslave and oppress the Congolese people.

It is worth noting that after carrying out a series of military threats, economic blockades, and subversive and destructive activities against the revolutionary Cuban people, the United States coerced the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas on August 28 to pass a "Declaration of San Jose" to create an excuse for further interference in Cuba. In this declaration, U.S. imperialism did its best to distort the facts, slander China and the Soviet Union for endangering the peace and security of the Americas, and accused Cuba, which had been interfered with and invaded, of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and endangering the unity and security of the Americas. However, it is very clear that U.S. imperialism's attempt to blame China and the Soviet Union and use Africans to fight Africans and Latin Americans to fight Latin Americans is absolutely impossible. The Congolese people and the people of all African countries are increasingly vigilantly watching the United States' aggressive activities in the Congo and Africa. The heroic Cuban people are always ready to fight back against any aggression and provocation by the United States. The people of Latin American countries resolutely support the just struggle waged by the Cuban people's envoys at the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas, and have shouted the slogan "We want Cuba, not the Yankees" everywhere. All this shows that U.S. imperialism's evil activities will more thoroughly expose its robber face and will further accelerate its own failure. He pointed out that as long as all forces that maintain world peace and oppose imperialist aggression further unite and carry out persistent struggle, they will surely be able to defeat any aggression and war activities of U.S. imperialism, and achieve continuous victories in the cause of defending world peace and striving for human progress.

Chen Ziping, the Vietnamese Ambassador to China, spoke. He said: Fifteen years is only a short moment in the history of a nation. However, within this short period of time, our Vietnamese people have valiantly defeated the imperialist aggressors and achieved great successes in the cause of socialist construction in North Vietnam. This is due to the correct leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party headed by Comrade Ho Chi Minh, which is the result of the skillful application of Marxism-Leninism in the practice of the Vietnamese revolution. These achievements are inseparable from the generous and selfless assistance of the fraternal Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries.

The Ambassador said that while the people of North Vietnam are building a peaceful, happy, and free life with excitement and pouring all their revolutionary enthusiasm, U.S. imperialism is increasingly deepening its interference in South Vietnam, attempting to turn South Vietnam into a new type of colony and military base to facilitate their preparation for war and to do their utmost to undermine the Geneva Accords.

The Ambassador stated that the Vietnamese people deeply recognize that the struggle against U.S. imperialism is a revolutionary struggle, a struggle to uphold and consolidate peace, and to seize and defend sovereignty, national independence, and territorial integrity. We firmly believe that the cause of peaceful reunification of Vietnam will surely win victory.

He stated that the Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam highly cherish the solidarity and unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and will spare no effort to further consolidate and develop the friendship between socialist countries based on the principles of proletarian internationalism.

He said that the Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, hope to develop and consolidate friendly relations with all countries in the world, thereby contributing to the noble cause of maintaining world peace.

The Ambassador said that the Vietnamese people are infinitely delighted to see that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the wise leader, the beloved Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved many extremely great achievements in industry, agriculture, culture, and social welfare under the brilliant illumination of the General Line. The Vietnamese people regard the victory achieved by the Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward as their own victory, and sincerely wish the Chinese people more and greater achievements.

The Ambassador said that the Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam warmly support the People's Republic of China's foreign policy of peace and friendship, which advocates the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; and support the Chinese government's proposal for Asian and Pacific countries to sign a peace pact of mutual non-aggression and turn the region into a nuclear weapon-free zone.

The Vietnamese people resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's occupation of Taiwan and its plot to create "two Chinas". Taiwan is China's sacred and inviolable territory, and Taiwan must be returned to the People's Republic of China.

The Ambassador concluded by saying that our two countries have a long history of relations and are now fighting for the common ideals of building socialism and defending peace, and fighting against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism. In the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, we will always stand shoulder to shoulder and unite together, which is the most solid guarantee for continuously strengthening the socialist forces and defeating the enemy. Imperialism will surely perish, and socialism will surely triumph.

Chen Huiliao, the head of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association delegation, spoke. He said that the joy of 28 million Vietnamese people is the joy of 650 million Chinese people, and also the joy of 1 billion people in socialist countries around the world. This is the most vivid and profound manifestation of the spirit of proletarian internationalism and the deep friendship between the people of Vietnam and China.

He said that the Vietnamese people are facing two tasks: building socialism in North Vietnam and struggling for the unification of the motherland. Today, the people of Vietnam and China are confronting the common enemy, U.S. imperialism. The cause of revolution and the cause of building socialism are our common cause. He said that we regard the achievements of China's Great Leap Forward in the process of building socialism as a common victory for our revolutionary cause and a common victory for our socialist camp.

The head of the delegation finally said: Under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, North Vietnam is preparing to enter the first five-year plan. Therefore, China's experience in socialist transformation and socialist construction is infinitely valuable to us. Your completion of the main production targets of the second five-year plan three years ahead of schedule is a great encouragement to us.

These speeches were received with extremely warm applause.

Today's conference was jointly held by the Foreign Cultural Commission, the China-Vietnam Friendship Association, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Women's Federation, and the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. The conference was presided over by Zhang Zhixiang, Acting Director of the Foreign Cultural Commission. Heads of various government departments, people's organizations, and Beijing Municipality attended the meeting, including Yang Xiufeng, Ji Pengfei, Qian Junrui, Lei Renmin, Liu Changsheng, Xu Guangping, Xu Zhizhen, Lao She, Zhang Chao, and Feng Jiping.

    首都各界盛大集会热烈庆贺越南人民的光辉节日
    祝越南人民胜利辉煌  祝中越友谊万古长青
    党和国家领导人周恩来董必武等出席大会，薄一波副总理陈子平大使陈辉燎团长讲了话
    人民大会堂举行联欢晚会，宾主共祝以苏联为首的社会主义阵营坚强团结
    据新华社1日讯　9月2日是越南民主共和国成立十五周年。首都各界人民一千五百多人今天上午在政协礼堂举行盛大集会，热烈庆祝越南人民的光辉节日。
    党和国家的领导人周恩来、董必武、彭真、沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、薄一波、习仲勋参加了大会。
    越南民主共和国驻中国大使陈子平，以陈辉燎为首的越中友好协会代表团，以武秋和高金典为首的越南民主共和国嘲剧艺术团，以怀青为首的越南文学院代表团的贵宾，都出席了大会。越南贵宾们受到参加大会的各界群众的热烈欢迎。
    今天，政协礼堂呈现出欢乐的节日景象。大会主席台正中的帷幕上，并排高悬中国和越南民主共和国的国旗，两旁悬有“1945—1960”的金色大字。会场内外挂着大幅标语：“中越两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！”“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结万岁！”
    大会在高奏庄严的越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国国歌声中开始。
    中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理薄一波讲话，他代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民向越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和兄弟的越南人民表示最热烈的祝贺。
    他说，勤劳勇敢的越南人民在越南劳动党的领导下，以坚强的革命意志和忘我的劳动热情，艰苦奋斗，沿着社会主义革命和社会主义建设的大道前进。他谈到了越南民主共和国在社会主义建设中取得的巨大成就。他说：兄弟的越南人民在未来的岁月中，一定能够在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的事业中取得更加辉煌的成就。
    薄一波指出，在美帝国主义和吴庭艳傀儡政权黑暗统治下的越南南方人民，仍然受着失业、贫困、饥饿和迫害的威胁，这种情况同越南北方形成了鲜明的对照。他说，美帝国主义和它的走狗的疯狂挣扎决不能挽回他们必然失败的最后命运。越南人民和平统一祖国的愿望是一定要实现的，六亿五千万中国人民永远支持越南人民的正义斗争直到他们取得最后的胜利。
    薄一波说，中国和越南都是热爱和平的国家。我们两国一贯奉行和平的外交政策，为争取实现不同社会制度国家的和平共处，缓和国际紧张局势，和保卫亚洲和世界的和平做出了坚持不懈的努力。他谴责美帝国主义破坏日内瓦协议，利用东南亚条约组织对印度支那各国不断地进行军事威胁和颠覆破坏活动的罪行。他还指出，美国正在通过它的仆从国家加紧干涉老挝的内政，企图阻止老挝走和平中立的道路。他说：中国和越南维护印度支那和平的立场是坚定不移的，印度支那各国人民反对外来干涉、维护民族独立的意志也是任何力量所不能动摇的。美帝国主义不管采取什么阴谋手法，它对印度支那的侵略计划是注定要失败的。
    薄一波说，美帝国主义在印度支那的罪恶活动是它的总的战争政策、侵略政策的一个组成部分。最近，美国正在采取它在印度支那所采取的类似的手法，加紧对非洲和拉丁美洲各国特别是对刚果和古巴的侵略扩张活动。美国一方面大肆叫嚣什么苏联和中国向非洲渗入，一方面却利用联合国的招牌公开露骨地干涉刚果的内政，侵犯刚果的主权，企图代替比利时殖民主义者，重新奴役和压榨刚果人民。
    值得严重注意的是，美国在对革命的古巴人民进行了一系列军事威胁、经济封锁和颠覆破坏的活动以后，又在8月28日胁迫美洲外长会议通过了一个为进一步干涉古巴制造借口的“圣约瑟宣言”。在这个宣言中，美帝国主义竭尽颠倒黑白之能事，诬蔑中国和苏联危害美洲的和平与安全，给被干涉被侵略的古巴按上了干涉别国内政、危害美洲团结和安全的罪名。但是，事情很清楚，美帝国主义妄想嫁罪中苏，利用非洲人打非洲人、利用拉丁美洲人打拉丁美洲人的罪恶企图是绝对办不到的。刚果人民和非洲各国人民已经越来越警惕地注视着美国在刚果和非洲的侵略活动。英雄的古巴人民时刻准备着反击美国的任何侵略和挑衅。拉丁美洲各国人民坚决支持古巴人民使者在美洲外长会议上所进行的正义斗争，并且到处喊出了“要古巴、不要美国佬”的口号。所有这些说明，美帝国主义的罪恶活动将更加彻底地暴露它的强盗嘴脸，将更加加速它自己的失败。他指出，只要一切维护世界和平和反对帝国主义侵略的力量进一步团结起来，坚持不懈地进行斗争，就一定能够击败美帝国主义的任何侵略和战争的活动，使保卫世界和平和争取人类进步的事业取得不断的胜利。
    越南驻中国大使陈子平讲话。他说：十五年，对一个民族的历史来说，只不过是短短的一瞬。可是，在这短促时间内，我们越南人民已英勇地战胜了帝国主义侵略者，并在越南北方的社会主义建设事业中取得了巨大成就。这是由于以胡志明同志为首的越南劳动党的正确领导，这种领导是马克思列宁主义在越南革命实践中巧妙运用的结果。这些成就是和兄弟般的苏联、中国以及其他社会主义国家慷慨无私的帮助分不开的。
    大使说，当我们越南北方人民正怀着兴奋的心情，倾注全部的革命热情来建设一个和平、幸福、自由的生活的时候，美帝国主义却日益加深对越南南方的干涉，妄图把越南南方变成一个新型的殖民地和军事基地，以利于他们准备战争，竭力破坏日内瓦协议。
    大使说，越南人民深刻地认识到，反对美帝国主义的斗争是一场革命斗争，是为维护和巩固和平，为夺取和保卫主权、民族独立和领土完整的斗争。我们深信，越南的和平统一事业必定会赢得胜利。
    他说，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府十分珍视以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结一致，并将竭尽一切力量来进一步巩固和发展这种建立在无产阶级国际主义原则上的社会主义各国的友谊。
    他说，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府根据和平共处五项原则，希望和世界上一切国家发展和巩固友谊关系，借以对维护世界和平的崇高事业作出贡献。
    大使说，越南人民怀着无限喜悦的心情看到，中国人民在由中国共产党和英明的领袖、敬爱的毛泽东同志的领导下，在总路线光辉的照耀下，已经在工农业和文化、社会福利各方面取得了许多极其巨大的成就。越南人民把中国人民在大跃进中所取得的胜利看做是自己的胜利一样，并且诚挚地预祝中国人民取得更多的更加巨大的成就。
    大使说，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府热烈拥护提倡和平共处五项原则的中华人民共和国的和平与友谊的外交政策；支持中国政府关于亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国签订一项互不侵犯的和平公约，并把这个地区变成无核武器地区的主张。
    越南人民坚决反对美帝国主义侵占台湾，制造“两个中国”的阴谋。台湾是中国神圣不可侵犯的领土，台湾必须归还给中华人民共和国。
    大使最后说，我们两国原来就有着悠久的历史关系，现在又在为建设社会主义、保卫和平的共同理想而奋斗，为反对共同的敌人美帝国主义而斗争。我们在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营里将永远肩并肩地团结一起，这就是不断加强社会主义力量和战胜敌人的最牢固的保障。帝国主义一定灭亡，社会主义一定胜利。
    越中友好协会代表团团长陈辉燎讲话。他说，二千八百万越南人民的欢乐就是六亿五千万中国人民的欢乐，同时也是世界上十亿社会主义国家的人民的欢乐。这是无产阶级国际主义精神和越中两国人民深厚友谊的最鲜明和最深刻的表现。
    他说，越南人民面对着两个任务：在越南北方建设社会主义，和为祖国的统一而进行斗争。越中两国人民今天在对抗着共同的敌人美帝国主义。革命事业，建设社会主义事业是我们共同的事业。他说，我们把中国在建设社会主义过程中所获得的大跃进的成就，看成是我们革命事业的共同胜利，看成是我们社会主义阵营的共同胜利。
    团长最后说：在越南劳动党的领导下，越南北方正准备跨入第一个五年计划。因此，中国社会主义改造和社会主义建设的经验，对我们来说是无限珍贵的。你们提前三年完成第二个五年计划的主要生产指标，对我们是一个很大的鼓舞。
    这些讲话都受到极其热烈的欢迎。
    今天的大会是由对外文委、中越友协、全国总工会、全国青联、全国妇联和全国文联联合举行的。大会由对外文委代主任张致祥主持。政府各部门、各人民团体和北京市的负责人参加了大会，他们当中有杨秀峰、姬鹏飞、钱俊瑞、雷任民、刘长胜、许广平、许之桢、老舍、张超、冯基平等。
