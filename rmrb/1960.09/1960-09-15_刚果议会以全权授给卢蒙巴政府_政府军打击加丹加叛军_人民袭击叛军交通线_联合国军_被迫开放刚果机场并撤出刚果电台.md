Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, September 13th - The Congolese Parliament passed a resolution tonight granting full powers to the Lumumba government.

The Congolese House of Representatives and Senate, in a joint session today, discussed the situation in the Congo caused by the United Nations' interference in the Congo's internal affairs and President Kasavubu's sudden announcement of the dismissal of the Lumumba government. The Congolese Parliament had already declared Kasavubu's decision invalid on the 7th.

The Senate and House of Representatives reiterated their full confidence in the Lumumba government. A few days ago, the two houses had voted to express confidence in the Lumumba government.

According to official preliminary statistics, in the parliamentary vote, eighty-eight votes were in favor of Lumumba, twenty-five against, and three abstained.

After the vote, Lumumba was warmly congratulated and cheered by the parliamentarians.

Earlier, Lumumba expressed his gratitude in a speech to the Congolese Parliament for supporting his government in the face of United Nations interference. He condemned the imperialist conspiracy against the Congolese government. He stated that he would continue to pursue a policy of neutrality.

Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, September 13th - Congolese House of Representatives Speaker Kasongo sent a telegram to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, again protesting the United Nations' interference in the Congo's internal affairs.

The telegram said, "The Secretariat of the House of Representatives of the Republic of the Congo, after hearing your radio broadcast speech on the current situation in the Congo, strongly protests your interference in the Congo's internal affairs."

The telegram stated that the Congo is a sovereign state, and regarding the Congo's internal problems, "only the two houses of the Congo have the right to make judgments, and a foreigner has no right to intervene; moreover, the two houses have already made a clear judgment. Therefore, the Secretariat of the House of Representatives must ask: By what authority do you judge the dispute between the (Congolese) head of state and the government?" The telegram pointed out, "These interventions are enough to prove that you (Hammarskjöld) are attempting to place the Congolese nation under United Nations trusteeship."

Xinhua News Agency, September 14th - Elizabethville Dispatch: Congolese government troops that entered Katanga Province struck at the reactionary troops of the Tshombe secessionist group along the Luika River in northern Katanga on the 12th and advanced further.

The report said that in order to severely strike the Tshombe secessionist group, another contingent of government troops is massing in large numbers near Fizi in Kivu Province, not far from Katanga Province. Fizi is an important stronghold on the highway from Kivu Province to Albertville in eastern Katanga Province. A battalion of Congolese government troops has already advanced to Kamata, twenty-five miles from Katanga Province.

According to reports, the people of Katanga Province are coordinating with the government's military operations, stepping up attacks on the Tshombe group's transportation lines. At Bukama, a key transportation hub in central Katanga Province, local tribal people recently attacked a train carrying troops of the Tshombe group with stones and cut off telephone lines along the way.

Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, September 13th - Under the strong protests of the Congolese government and people, as well as world public opinion, the United Nations authorities were forced today to announce the reopening of the Congolese airports, which they had illegally blockaded for a week.

At the same time, the United Nations authorities were forced this morning to order the withdrawal from the Congolese government radio station in Leopoldville. Most of the
  "UN forces" guarding the radio station have withdrawn, but a small number of soldiers have been ordered to remain there.

It is noteworthy that, immediately after the United Nations ordered the withdrawal from the radio station, the first person allowed by the "UN forces" to enter the radio station and deliver a speech was Bolicango, the "Minister of Propaganda" appointed by the illegal Ileo government. He went to the radio station this morning under the protection of some gendarmes.

Later, many supporters of the legitimate Congolese government, led by Prime Minister Lumumba, rushed to the radio station and demanded to take over the radio station, but they were confronted by a small group of gendarmes carrying weapons. At that time, the situation was quite tense.

As previously reported, after Kasavubu suddenly announced the dismissal of Lumumba as Prime Minister on the 5th, the United Nations authorities brazenly announced the occupation and blockade of the Congo's airports on the 6th. At the same time, the "UN forces" stationed in Leopoldville also seized the Congolese government radio station, forbidding the legitimate Congolese government from using it.

    刚果议会以全权授给卢蒙巴政府
    政府军打击加丹加叛军　人民袭击叛军交通线
    “联合国军”被迫开放刚果机场并撤出刚果电台
    新华社利奥波德维尔13日电刚果议会今晚通过把全权授给卢蒙巴政府。
    刚果众议院和参议院在今天举行的联席会议上讨论了由于联合国干涉刚果内政和卡萨武布总统突然宣布解除卢蒙巴政府的职务所引起的刚果局势问题。刚果议会已经在7日宣布卡萨武布的这个决定无效。
    参议院和众议院再次表示充分信任卢蒙巴政府。几天以前，两院曾经投票对卢蒙巴政府表示信任。
    据官方的初步统计，在议会表决中八十八票赞成卢蒙巴，二十五票反对，三票弃权。
    在表决以后，卢蒙巴受到议员们的热烈祝贺和欢呼。
    早些时候，卢蒙巴在演说中表示感谢刚果议会支持他的面临联合国干涉的政府。他谴责帝国主义反对刚果政府的阴谋。他表示，他将继续奉行中立政策。
    新华社利奥波德维尔13日电刚果众议院议长卡松戈致电联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，再次抗议联合国干涉刚果内政。
    电报说，“刚果共和国众议院秘书处听到了你就刚果当前局势发表的无线电广播讲话之后，强烈抗议你干涉刚果内政。”
    电报说，刚果是一个主权国家，对刚果内部问题，“只有刚果的参众两院有权作出判断，一个外国人无权过问；而且两院已经作出了明确的判断。因此，众议院秘书处要问一句：你凭什么资格来对（刚果）国家元首同政府之间的纠纷作出判断？”电报指出，“这些干涉足以证明你（哈马舍尔德）企图把刚果国家置于联合国托管之下。”
    新华社14日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：攻入加丹加省的刚果政府军，12日在加丹加北部的卢伊卡河沿岸打击冲伯分裂集团的反动军队，并且在向前挺进。
    消息说，为了狠狠打击冲伯分裂集团，另一路政府军正在基伍省离加丹加省不远的菲齐附近大量集结。菲齐是基伍省通往加丹加省东部阿尔伯特维尔城的公路上的一个重要据点。有一营刚果政府军已经推进到离加丹加省二十五英里的卡马塔。
    据报道，加丹加省人民正在配合政府军的军事行动，加紧袭击冲伯集团的交通线。在加丹加省中部的重要交通据点布卡马，当地部族人民最近用石块袭击了一列载运冲伯集团军队的火车，并且切断了沿路的电话线。
    新华社利奥波德维尔13日电在刚果政府和人民以及世界舆论的强烈抗议下，联合国当局今天被迫宣布重新开放它非法封锁达一星期之久的刚果各机场。
    与此同时，联合国当局今天上午被迫下令从利奥波德维尔的刚果政府电台撤退。看守电台的大部分
  “联合国军”已经撤出，但仍有一小部分士兵奉命留守在那里。
    值得注意的是，就在联合国下令从电台撤退之后，被“联合国军”允许进入电台并发表谈话的第一个人竟是由伊利奥非法政府任命的
  “宣传部长”博利康果。他在一些宪兵的保护下今天上午前往电台。
    晚些时候，很多支持刚果合法政府的人在卢蒙巴总理率领下赶到电台，并要求接管电台，但是，他们面对着携带武器的一小群宪兵。那个时候，形势相当紧张。
    前已报道，联合国当局在卡萨武布5日突然宣布解除卢蒙巴的总理职务后，于6日悍然宣布占领并封锁了刚果的机场。同时，驻利奥波德维尔的“联合国军”还强占了刚果政府电台，不准合法的刚果政府使用。
