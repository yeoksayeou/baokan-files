Going Deep into the Front Lines Yields a Triple Harvest of Work, Labor, and Learning: Linhai Cadres Improve Their Skills and Work Becomes More Outstanding

(Our Dispatch) More than 10,000 cadres at all levels in Linhai County, Zhejiang Province, after going deep into the forefront of production, have been participating in and leading production through a system of tiered responsibility. Leading cadres of all departments have generally established fixed points in teams, assigned responsibilities to individuals, delineated areas of responsibility, and contracted with communes. Using points to drive the whole area, they are responsible from start to finish, resulting in a continuous great leap forward in all aspects of the county's work.

In Linhai, among the broad masses of cadres, eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses has become a regular practice. Since the beginning of spring this year, under the unified planning and comprehensive arrangement of the county party committee, cadres from all departments, including agriculture and forestry, industry, transportation, finance and trade, culture, education, health, political and legal affairs, and youth and women's organizations, have been led by leading cadres to settle down in the communes, teams, and points designated by the county party committee, taking responsibility for contracting. All six secretaries, five standing committee members, and seven members of the county party committee have been assigned to teams and points, responsible for specific tasks, and dividing up communes to oversee. The county party committee office was moved to the Datian Commune to work, and the chiefs, bureau directors, and ministers of all departments also led cadres from their respective departments to settle down in the teams and points designated by the county party committee. Cadres of communes, brigades, and production teams also took responsibility according to their levels, with tiered contracting from start to finish. In order to give the cadres assigned to teams a clear purpose, the county party committee also stipulated five tasks for them: ① Implement the party's guidelines and policies, and complete the party's tasks; ② Participate in labor, grasp the production situation and the ideological dynamics of cadres and the masses; ③ Train cadres and strengthen party and league organizations; ④ Cultivate experimental plots, create typical examples, and set examples, and hold on-the-spot meetings for promotion; ⑤ Help production teams solve specific problems. Now, when cadres assigned to teams come to meetings, they achieve "three deliveries": first, delivery of labor logs; second, delivery of production progress and the ideological situation of cadres and the masses; and third, delivery of advanced experiences and learning心得, achieving a triple harvest of work, learning, and labor. Many cadres have become all-rounders in their labor practices, learning from experienced farmers. Recently, at the three-level cadre conference held by the county party committee, 123 outstanding cadres were commended throughout the county. Shi Xiansen, the general branch secretary of the Dianqian Brigade of the Shuanggang Commune, participated in 220 days of labor in the past eight months and became a model cadre who went deep into his work, actively participated in labor, and adhered to the "four togethers." The masses call him "a good cadre of the party and a confidant of the masses."

The Linhai County Party Committee also adopted the method of each department contracting with a commune, based on the principle of both better serving the party's central tasks, strengthening the grassroots leadership, and facilitating the development of departmental work. For example, the grassroots leadership work of the Chengxi Commune was well done, so it was contracted by the Organization Department; the Haiyou Commune focused on commune-run industry, so it was the responsibility of the Industrial and Transportation Department. This closely integrates departmental work with the central tasks of the party committee. At the same time, after the various departments are assigned to communes, their sense of responsibility and consciousness in supporting agricultural production is also stronger. After the cadres of the industrial departments went deep into the communes and teams, they more deeply understood the necessity of supporting the technical transformation of agriculture. The vast number of cadres and workers on the industrial front of the county consciously, actively, and according to the agricultural season, rushed to manufacture a large number of agricultural tools to support agriculture. In the spring, the industrial departments helped the communes and brigades manufacture tens of thousands of tools for mountain and water management and spring plowing. Immediately afterwards, before the summer harvest and planting, they rushed to produce a large number of harvesting, threshing, transportation, plowing, raking, and transplanting tools. After the cadres of the finance and trade departments made the team their home, they more clearly established production and policy viewpoints. They organized 520 cadres and workers to go to the countryside and assign them to teams to support agricultural production. The staff and cadres responsible for the supply of means of production not only participated in agricultural production, but also delivered 125,000 pieces of harvesting and planting tools to the production teams in a "fast, early, good, and comprehensive" manner, which not only met the needs of agricultural production, but also overfulfilled the supply and marketing tasks. Commercial department cadres learned in their participation in productive labor that some teams lacked basal fertilizer for late rice, so they cooperated with the Tongzhi Commune Party Committee to implement the plan at the team level, adopting the method of using local materials and indigenous methods to vigorously develop local fertilizer.

Currently, the broad masses of cadres and people in the county are confidently launching a vigorous high-standard field management campaign for late rice and super-early rice, striving to harvest more autumn grain. (Yuan Shaotang)

    深入第一线得到工作、劳动、学习三丰收
　　临海干部水平提高工作更加出色
    本报讯　浙江省临海县各级干部一万多名，深入生产第一线后，在参加生产领导生产中，层层包干。各部门领导干部都普遍定点落队，责任到人，划片负责，分社包干，以点带面，一包到底，全县各项工作出现了持续跃进的大好局面。
    在临海广大干部中，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，已成为经常的制度。今年入春以来，在县委的统一规划和全面安排下，全县农林、工业、交通、财贸、文教卫生、政法和青妇等各个部门的干部，都由领导干部带领，到县委指定的社、队、点去安家落户，负责包干；县委六个书记，五个常委，七个委员全都落实到队、到点，分工负责，划片包社，并把县委办公室搬到大田公社办公，各部门的科、局、部长也都带领本部门的干部落实到县委指定的队、点去；各公社、大队、生产队的干部也做到按级负责，逐级包干，一包到底。为了使落队干部有明确的目的，县委还对落队干部规定了五条任务：①贯彻执行党的方针、政策，完成党的任务；②参加劳动，掌握生产情况和干群思想动态；③培养干部，壮大党团组织；④种试验田、搞典型、做样子，开现场会推广；⑤帮助生产队解决具体问题。现在落队干部开会上来时做到了“三交”：一交劳动手册、二交生产进度和干群思想情况、三交先进经验和学习心得，达到工作、学习、劳动三丰收。许多干部在劳动实践中，拜老农为师，成了多面手。最近，县委召开的三级干部大会上，全县评出了优秀干部一百二十三名。双港公社店前大队总支书记施贤森，在今年八个月中参加劳动二百二十天，成了工作深入、劳动积极、坚持“四同”的模范干部，群众称他是“党的好干部，群众的知心人”。
    临海县委还根据既能更好地为党的中心工作服务，加强基层领导力量，又能便于部门业务工作开展的原则，采取各部门包公社的方法。如城西公社党的基层领导工作搞得出色，就由组织部包干；海游公社是以社办工业为重点，就由工业交通部门负责。这样使部门业务工作与党委中心工作紧密结合，同时，各部门落实到公社后，对支援农业生产的责任心和自觉性也就更强了。工业部门干部深入到社、队以后，更深刻地了解到支援农业技术改造的必要性，全县工业战线上的广大干部和职工都自觉地、积极地、按农时季节，赶制大批农具支援农业。开春，工业部门就帮助社、大队制造了上万件治山治水和春耕用的工具，紧接着，在夏收夏种之前，又赶制好了大批的收割、脱粒、运输、耕耙、插秧等收种工具。财贸部门干部以队为家后，更明确地树立了生产观点和政策观点，他们组织了五百二十名干部、职工下乡落队，支援农业生产。负责生产资料供应的职工和干部，不仅参加农业生产，还“快、早、好、全”地把十二万五千件收种工具及时地送到了生产队，既满足了农业生产的需要，又超额完成了供销任务。商业部门干部在参加生产劳动中了解到部分队晚稻基肥不足，他们就配合桐峙公社党委落实到队，采取就地取材，土法上马的方法大搞土化肥。
    当前，全县广大干部和群众正信心百倍地开展了轰轰烈烈的晚稻超早稻的高标准田间管理运动，力争收到更多的秋粮。　（袁绍棠）
