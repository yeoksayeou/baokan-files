Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, September 2nd: Guixi County, Jiangxi Province, while firmly grasping the management of autumn fields, has adopted six measures to fully exploit the production potential of 200,000 mu of autumn and winter fallow land, which accounts for one-third of the county's cultivated area.

Currently, in Guixi County's 100,000 mu of autumn fallow land, over 80,000 mu have been planted with crops such as soybeans, sesame, and corn. Intercropping of low-stalk crops such as sweet potatoes, autumn vegetables, and radishes is also being carried out in high-stalk crops. After the autumn crops are harvested, wheat or green manure will be planted for harvesting next spring. In this way, coupled with the already harvested spring crops, four crops can be achieved in three harvests each year, and some autumn fallow land that has not yet been planted can achieve three crops in two harvests. In addition, measures have been taken to change the 100,000 mu of winter fallow land, which has historically been planted once and harvested once a year, to two plantings (green manure or wheat) and one harvest, in preparation for more fully utilizing the land utilization rate next year.

The six measures taken by Guixi County to eliminate autumn and winter fallow land and improve land utilization are:

	One, conduct in-depth investigation and comprehensive planning. The county adopted a method combining cadres, experienced farmers, and agricultural technicians. A large-scale investigation and research group and inspection group, led by the county party secretary, traveled throughout the county and found many unutilized autumn and winter fallow lands. For example, in Xiong Dou Commune on both banks of the Xin River, more than 17,000 mu of river滩land outside of the planting tasks were found, which had not been cultivated due to fear of rising river waters in spring and summer. The county also inspected nearly 20,000 mu of land upstream of six reservoirs that were submerged during spring water storage and reappeared during summer drought resistance. These lands can be utilized in autumn and winter without hindering reservoir water storage and irrigation next spring. After the investigation and research group found these autumn and winter fallow lands, they formulated utilization plans based on natural conditions such as soil quality, water source, and season, and handed them over to the farming units for specific arrangements.

	Two, muster full enthusiasm, make decisive decisions, and launch a concentrated campaign to eliminate autumn and winter fallow land. While firmly grasping the management of late rice autumn fields, the county established command structures at all levels with the main task of eliminating autumn and winter fallow land and improving land utilization rate. It drew manpower to organize a strong labor force, combining large-scale mobile operations with production team contracting, and basically completed the planting work of 100,000 mu of autumn fallow land in less than ten days.

	Three, establish farmland water conservancy projects and prepare water lifting tools. The county organized nearly 10,000 commune members to build four winding mountain and river-crossing canals totaling 60 kilometers in length for four reservoirs, solving the irrigation water source for the second season of late rice on 8,000 mu of autumn and winter fallow land. At the same time, in order to solve the difficulty of insufficient water lifting tools, three communes, including Tangwan, temporarily took out the power motors of water pumps used for lighting and processing to pump water. The industrial sector rushed to manufacture 80 ox-powered waterwheels, solving the water shortage difficulty for 1,600 mu of autumn fallow land.

	Four, organize labor support for areas with more land, fewer people, and heavy tasks. In this county, each laborer in the four communes of Zhoufang, Xiongshi, and Sili had to bear more than 40 mu of cultivated land, and the autumn and winter fallow land was also low-yield land with poor natural conditions. In order to make these already planted and to-be-planted fallow lands high-yielding, the Guixi County Committee of the Communist Party of China organized labor support from community-run industries and urban residents. At present, the area of cultivated land borne by the laborers in these communes has been reduced by half.

	Five, do everything possible to meet the fertilizer needs for eliminating autumn and winter fallow land. The county organized 50,000 people to set up camps in mountainous areas to cut and harvest green manure on a large scale. The Guixi County Committee of the Communist Party of China also sent cadres to Inner Mongolia, Northeast China, and other places to purchase more than 162,000 jin of high-quality fertilizers such as bone ash and bone meal, so that the autumn and winter fallow land had sufficient fertilizer when planting crops.

	Six, establish a management contract responsibility system. The county delegated more than 500 cadres to the grassroots level and established a high-yield slope responsibility system. Each delegated cadre has established 460 responsibility zones in low-yield slopes and low-yield ridges, doing everything possible to strengthen management and ensure the realization of production increase plans.

    采取有效措施　发挥土地潜力　实行多种多收
    贵溪利用秋冬空闲地大种粮食
    十万亩秋闲地已种玉米等八万亩，十万亩冬闲地将种绿肥和麦子
    新华社南昌2日电　江西贵溪县在狠抓秋田管理的同时，采取了六项措施，充分发挥占全县耕地面积三分之一的二十万亩秋冬两季空闲田的生产潜力。
    目前，贵溪县十万亩秋闲田中，已有八万多亩种上了黄豆、芝麻、玉米等作物。并在高秆作物中套种红薯、秋菜、萝卜等低茎作物。秋季作物收割后再种上明春收割的大小麦或绿肥。这样，加上已收的一季小春作物，每年可达到四种三收，部分至今未种的秋闲田也可达到三种两收。此外，还采取措施把历年不种的十万亩冬闲田由每年一种一收改为两种（种绿肥或大、小麦）一收，为明年更充分的发挥土地利用率作好准备。
    贵溪县消灭秋冬空闲田和提高土地利用率的六项措施是：
    一、深入调查，全面规划。全县采取干部、老农、农业技术人员三结合的方法，以县委书记为首组织了大型调查研究组和检查组，跑遍全县找到了许多未利用的秋冬空闲田。如在信江两岸雄豆公社发现了一万七千多亩播种任务以外的河滩地，因怕春夏河流涨水而未耕种。全县又在六个水库的上游，检查出近两万亩在春季蓄水时被淹没，夏季抗旱时又呈现出来的土地。这些土地秋冬都可利用而不妨碍明春水库蓄水灌溉。调查研究组查出这些秋冬空闲田后，又根据土质、水源、季节等自然条件，作出利用规划，交耕作单位进行具体安排。
    二、鼓足干劲，当机立断，突击消灭秋冬闲田。全县在狠抓晚稻秋田管理的同时，层层建立以消灭秋冬两季空闲田和提高土地利用率为主要任务的指挥机构。抽调人力组织一支强有力的劳动大军，以大兵团流动作战和生产队包干相结合的方式，在不到十天的时间内就基本结束了十万亩秋闲田的耕种工作。
    三、建立田间水利工程，准备提水工具。全县组织近万名社员为四个水库突击修了四条盘山跨河长达六十公里的渠道，解决了八千亩秋闲田、冬闲田的二季晚稻的灌溉水源。同时，为了解决提水工具不足的困难，塘湾等三个公社都把用于照明和加工的抽水机动力马达临时拿出来抽水。工业部门赶制了八十部牛力水车，使一千六百亩秋闲田解决了缺水困难。
    四、组织劳力支援田多人少任务大的地区。这个县周坊、雄石、泗沥等四个公社每个劳动力要负担四十亩以上耕地，秋冬空闲地也都是自然条件较差的低产田。为使这些已种和待种作物的空闲地能够高产，中共贵溪县委从社办工业、城镇居民等方面，组织劳力进行支援。目前这些公社劳动力所负担的耕地面积已减轻了一半。
    五、千方百计满足消灭秋冬闲田所需要的肥料。全县组织五万人到山区安营扎寨大铲大割青草肥。中共贵溪县委还派出干部到内蒙古、东北等地采购牛骨灰、牛骨粉等优质肥料十六万二千多斤，使冬秋两季空闲田在播种作物时有充足的肥料。
    六、建立管理包产责任制。全县下放五百多名干部到基层，建立了高产坂责任制。各下放干部已在低产坂、低产垅建立了四百六十个责任区，千方百计地加强管理，保证实现增产计划。
