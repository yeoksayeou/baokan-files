Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 13th. According to a broadcast on the 12th by the Lao Fighting Forces Radio, the Lao "Coup Committee" armed forces heavily counter-attacked a company of Phoumi Nosavan's traitorous group on September 8th in the area south of Muong Et. These reactionary troops attempted to threaten the local people and destroy the local "Coup Committee" but were utterly routed, and some stubborn leaders were also wounded.

Before counter-attacking these reactionary troops, the "Coup Committee" armed forces had called out to them, hoping they would not follow the Phoumi Nosavan group, but the commander of this army refused the warning.

    老挝“政变委员会”武装力量
    痛击前来“扫荡”的反动军队
    新华社河内13日电　据寮国战斗部队电台12日广播，老挝“政变委员会”武装力量9月8日痛痛地反击了在芒埃特南面地区进行“扫荡”的一连富米·诺萨万叛国集团的军队。这支反动军队企图威胁当地人民和破坏地方“政变委员会”，却被打得落花流水，一些顽固的头目也被击伤了。
    “政变委员会”的武装力量在反击这批反动军队以前，曾向他们喊话，希望他们不要跟随富米·诺萨万集团，但是这支军队的指挥员拒绝了这个警告。
