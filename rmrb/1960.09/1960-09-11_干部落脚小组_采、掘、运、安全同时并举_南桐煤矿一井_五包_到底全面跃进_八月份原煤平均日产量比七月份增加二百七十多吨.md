This newspaper reports: Nantong Coal Mine No. 1 Well in Chongqing, based on the implementation of the underground office system, assigned over 90% of its cadres into work groups, placing them in production teams for coal mining, excavation, transportation, and other work types. They worked alongside the workers, comprehensively strengthening all aspects of mining, excavation, transportation, and safety. This resulted in a positive situation of sustained high production. Since July, raw coal production has been increasing week by week, and the average daily raw coal output in August increased by more than 270 tons compared to July.

After learning from the underground office experience of Yutianpu Coal Mine, this mine moved the production dispatch station from the ground to underground. Every shift has a mine chief and a dispatcher on duty underground. "Three Workers" (electricians, fitters, and track workers) also went underground. This played a significant role in strengthening on-site production dispatch. However, due to the large distances between various coal mining and excavation faces, and the significant changes in underground production conditions, there were many problems that needed research and resolution. The cadres on duty underground were often too busy to handle everything, and some problems still could not be resolved well. Therefore, they decided to both increase the underground command force and ensure that cadres going to the front line of production would primarily focus on production teams, closely integrating the implementation of the underground office system with the comprehensive strengthening of the work of production teams. At the same time, they made unified arrangements for the time spent going down and coming up, working and studying, and implemented a "six-one" work system. The specific method is as follows: In addition to retaining a small number of cadres to manage ground work, the vast majority of leading cadres and general cadres in the mine spend six days a week delving into coal mining, excavation, transportation and other production teams to work alongside the workers, implementing the "Five Packages" (i.e., package production tasks, package political and ideological work, package safety, package consolidation and improvement of technological innovation projects, package life), and spend one day on the ground handling their own business and assisting second-line work, and arranging their own studies. This ensures that over 90% of cadres are underground working and leading production every day, and that ground work and cadre studies are properly arranged.

For a long time, this mine had the problem that little or no coal was produced in the first two hours of each shift, while coal was mined intensively in the last two hours, which often affected regular cyclical operations. After repeated discussions, the mine's party general branch made a resolution to focus on the first and last two hours of each shift to ensure sustained high production. First, the cadres on duty went underground before the workers to understand the production situation of the previous shift and make detailed arrangements for the shift's production based on this information. Problems were resolved as early as possible by organizing forces to tackle them, greatly shortening non-production time. Second, education on the spirit of communist collaboration was strengthened, focusing on the work of the last two hours of each shift. Before the end of each shift, it was necessary not only to ensure the completion of the shift's production tasks, to maintain a certain amount of coal in the working face, but also to prepare a certain number of coal cars to prepare for the necessary production of the next shift. At the same time, the handover system was further improved. During the handover, it was important not only to hand over production tools, but more importantly, to clearly hand over production experience and existing problems. This ensured that the next shift could start production normally as soon as they came to work, achieving sustained high production.

Cadres going deep into the teams and implementing the "Five Packages" vigorously promoted the further development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Taking hydraulic coal mining as an example, the 411 coal mining face in this mine had implemented hydraulic coal mining a long time ago, but due to some key problems not being resolved, production was not normal. The average daily production level from February to June this year was only over 200 tons. In early July, Deputy Mine Chief Lu Changhua went to this coal mining face to implement the "Five Packages" and discussed and studied with the workers, quickly formulating specific measures to consolidate and improve hydraulic coal mining. With the support and assistance of other units, the key problems such as insufficient water supply and slime coal lifting were basically solved within a week, and the average daily output quickly increased to more than 420 tons, with the highest daily output reaching more than 700 tons.

Cadres going deep into the teams and implementing the "Five Packages" also promoted the in-depth development of the labor competition. After the cadres went deep into the production teams to implement the "Five Packages," the competition between the various production teams was actually a competition between the cadres. Each cadre was both the organizer and the participant in the competition. Under the influence and leadership of the cadres, not only was there a competition between the three shifts of each team and between workers of the same work type, but also a streamlined collaborative competition between workers in coal mining, excavation, transportation, and mechanical and electrical work in each shift. This created a dynamic situation of catching up with each other, creating favorable conditions for each other, and improving together, further promoting the development of production.

Because 90% of cadres are regularly kept working in the front line of production and in teams, strengthening on-site leadership, many problems are solved in a timely manner underground and in teams, and the leadership work at the mine level has therefore improved.

### 干部落脚小组　采、掘、运、安全同时并举  南桐煤矿一井“五包”到底全面跃进  八月份原煤平均日产量比七月份增加二百七十多吨

    干部落脚小组　采、掘、运、安全同时并举
    南桐煤矿一井“五包”到底全面跃进
    八月份原煤平均日产量比七月份增加二百七十多吨
    本报讯　重庆南桐煤矿一井在推行井下办公制度的基础上，把90％以上的干部分别组成工作组，放到采煤、掘进、运输等工种的生产小组去，跟班劳动，全面加强了采、掘、运、安全等各个环节的工作，形成了大幅度持续高产的大好形势。从7月份以来，原煤产量逐旬上升，8月份的原煤平均日产量比7月份增加了二百七十多吨。
    这个井在学习鱼田堡煤矿井下办公的经验后，将生产调度站从地面搬到井下，每班都有一个井长和一个调度员在井下值班。“三工”（电工、钳工、道工）也下了井。这对于加强现场的生产调度工作起了很大的作用。但由于各个采煤工作面、掘进工作面之间的距离较远，井下生产条件的变化大，需要研究和解决的问题很多，在井下值班的干部往往忙不过来，有些问题仍然不能很好地得到解决。因此，他们一方面决定增加井下指挥的力量，一方面决定下到生产第一线的干部主要以生产小组为落脚点，把推行井下办公制与全面加强生产小组的工作紧密结合起来。同时把下去和上来、工作和学习的时间作了统一的安排，实行了“六一”工作制。具体做法是：除留少数干部管地面工作外，全井绝大多数的负责干部和一般干部，在一周之内，以六天的时间深入到采、掘、运等生产小组中去跟班劳动，实行“五包”（即包生产任务，包政治思想工作、包安全、包技术革新项目的巩固和提高、包生活），以一天的时间在地面处理本身的业务，协助二线工作，安排自己的学习。这样既保证了每天都有90％以上的干部在井下跟班劳动，领导生产，又妥善地安排了地面工作和干部的学习。
    长期以来，这个井存在着每班前两小时出煤少甚至不出煤，而到了后两小时又突击采煤，因而往往影响正规循环作业的情况。经过反复讨论，这个井的党总支作出了狠抓每班的前两小时和后两小时的工作，确保持续高产的决议。首先值班干部比工人提前下井，了解上班的生产情况，根据这些情况周密地安排本班的生产。对于存在的问题尽早地组织力量加以突击解决，大大地缩短了非生产时间。其次，加强共产主义协作精神的教育，狠抓每班后两小时的工作。每班在快下班前，不仅要保证本班生产任务的完成，使掌子面保持一定的存煤，并且准备好一定数量的煤车，为下一班做好必要的生产准备工作。同时进一步健全了交接班制度，在交接班的时候，不仅要交代好生产工具，更重要的是交代清楚生产上的经验和存在的问题。这样就保证了下一班一上班就能正常进行生产，实现持续高产。
    干部深入小组实行“五包”，有力地推动了技术革新和技术革命运动的进一步开展。以水力采煤为例，这个井四一一采煤工作面在很早以前就推行了水力采煤，但由于一些关键问题未获得解决，生产不够正常，今年2月至6月的平均日产水平只有二百多吨。7月初，副井长陆昌华到这个采煤工作面实行“五包”，和工人一起商量、研究，迅速制定了巩固和提高水力采煤的具体措施，在其他单位的支援和帮助下，在一周的时间内，基本上解决了水源不足和泥煤提升等关键问题，使平均日产量迅速提高到四百二十吨以上，最高日产量达到七百吨以上。
    干部深入小组实行“五包”，还推动了劳动竞赛的深入开展。干部深入生产小组实行“五包”后，各个生产小组之间的竞赛，实际上也就是干部之间的竞赛。每个干部既是竞赛的组织者，又是竞赛的参加者。在干部的影响和带动下，不仅各个小组三个班之间、同工种的工人之间开展了对手赛，而且每一个班的采、掘、运、机电等工种的工人之间还开展了一条龙协作竞赛，形成了你追我赶，互相创造有利条件，共同提高的生动局面，进一步推动了生产的发展。
    由于经常保持有90％的干部深入生产第一线和小组进行工作，加强了现场领导，使很多问题在井下和小组里及时得到了解决，井一级的领导工作也因而提高了。
