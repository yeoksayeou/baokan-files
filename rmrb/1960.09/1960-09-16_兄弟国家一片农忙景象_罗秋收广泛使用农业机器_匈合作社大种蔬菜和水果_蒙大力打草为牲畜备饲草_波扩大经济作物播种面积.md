Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, September 14th: Romania's autumn harvest has begun. Currently, approximately 300,000 hectares of sunflowers, sugar beets, potatoes, corn, and green fodder maize have been harvested.

Romania's total autumn harvest crops (including green fodder maize) cover more than 5 million hectares this year. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has instructed all regions to make full use of agricultural machinery and transportation equipment to carry out the autumn harvest work in a timely manner. This year, there are more types of agricultural machinery than last year. The country now has 53,500 agricultural tractors (standard units) and 15,000 grain combine harvesters; at the end of last year, there were only 51,000 agricultural tractors and 10,800 grain combine harvesters in the country. This year, due to the widespread adoption of advanced agricultural cultivation techniques, water conservancy construction, increased fertilizer application, and rational use of agricultural machinery by agricultural workers in various regions, various autumn harvest crops are growing well. Taking green fodder maize as an example, the "Unity" Collective Farm in Craiova Prefecture achieved an average yield of 45,000 kilograms per hectare on 82 hectares of land.

While carrying out the autumn harvest work, autumn plowing and preparations for autumn sowing are also actively underway.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, September 13th: Hungary has achieved good results in developing vegetable production this year. The vegetable planting area in many regions has been expanded, and the yield per unit area has greatly increased.

The amount of vegetables provided to the state by agricultural production cooperatives this year has greatly increased compared to last year. The state's vegetable procurement plan for the first half of the year has been overfulfilled by 12%. The potato procurement plan for the first half of the year was also overfulfilled by 12%. There are now 650 agricultural production cooperatives nationwide striving to produce 100 quintals of potatoes per holt (equivalent to 8.55 mu).

The supply of vegetables and fruits to the capital, Budapest, and various industrial cities has greatly improved. For example, the amount of vegetables and fruits provided to the capital by agricultural production cooperatives in Pest County near Budapest has quadrupled compared to last year.

Agricultural collectivization has provided broad possibilities for the rapid development of vegetable production. Before collectivization, Szabolcs-Szatmár County needed to buy more than 100 freight cars of vegetables from other places every year. However, this year, the county can not only be self-sufficient in vegetables but also export them. So far, the county has exported 40 freight cars of radishes and 500 freight cars of cabbage.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, September 15th: Mongolian pastoral areas are actively carrying out haymaking to prepare fodder for livestock to overwinter.

This year, Mongolia plans to cut 1,727,000 tons of hay nationwide. During the vigorous growing season of pasture grass, various agricultural and pastoral farms, animal husbandry machinery stations, and cooperatives are carrying out haymaking operations in hayfields. According to statistics from early September, more than 641,000 tons of hay have been cut nationwide, completing 37.1% of the plan.

Sükhbaatar, Middle Gobi, and Khovd provinces are performing well in haymaking. Some counties, cooperatives, and animal husbandry machinery stations in Sükhbaatar Province had already completed their annual haymaking plans by the end of August. Other cooperatives in the province promoted the haymaking experience of the aforementioned cooperatives and are preparing to complete the haymaking task soon. Middle Gobi and Khovd provinces have completed more than 70% of their haymaking plans. Khuvsgul province mobilized cooperatives to organize 25 haymaking teams, which cut more than 100 tons of hay on 125 hectares of hayfields in ten days. Central Province plans to cut 170,000 tons of hay and has now organized 67 youth haymaking teams, preparing to complete the task in 25 days.

Some regions are organizing competitions in haymaking work, and party and administrative leaders are going to the haymaking teams to help summarize experience. In Govi-Altai Province, the efficiency of haymaking was improved due to the competition launched among the various haymaking teams of the animal husbandry machinery stations and cooperatives.

Bayan-Ölgii Province, which is relatively dry, not only achieved high haymaking efficiency but also made silage.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, September 14th: According to the Polish Press Agency, the Polish Central Statistical Office recently announced the final results of the agricultural survey for June this year. The collected data shows that a series of favorable changes have taken place in Polish agriculture, especially in livestock breeding.

The number of livestock in Poland continued to grow this year, with a larger increase than in 1959, totaling 4%. Compared with last year, the difference is that there is a greater increase in young livestock. Collective farms have expanded this part of livestock breeding, with a total increase of 18% compared to 1959, and state farms increased by 12%.

According to survey data, the number of pigs has also increased significantly this year, with state farms increasing the most, by 25%, and collective farms increasing by 21%.

    兄弟国家一片农忙景象
    罗秋收广泛使用农业机器  匈合作社大种蔬菜和水果
    蒙大力打草为牲畜备饲草  波扩大经济作物播种面积
    新华社布加勒斯特14日电　罗马尼亚秋收工作已经开始，目前，向日葵、甜菜、马铃薯、玉米和青饲玉蜀黍已经收获约三十万公顷。
    罗马尼亚今年各种秋收作物（包括青饲玉蜀黍）共计五百多万公顷。农林部已经指示各地，要求充分利用农业机器和运输工具，及时进行秋收工作。今年，各种农业机器都比去年增加。全国现有农业用拖拉机五万三千五百台（标准台）、谷物联合收割机一万五千台；而在去年年底，全国还只有五万一千多台农业用拖拉机、一万零八百多台谷物联合收割机。今年，由于各地农业劳动者广泛采用先进的农业耕作技术、兴修水利、增施肥料和合理使用农业机器，因此，各种秋收作物生长都良好。以青饲玉蜀黍为例，克拉约发州的“团结”集体农庄在八十二公顷土地上平均每公顷的产量达四万五千公斤。
    在开展秋收工作的同时，秋耕工作和秋播的准备工作也在积极进行。
    新华社布达佩斯13日电　匈牙利今年在发展蔬菜生产方面取得了良好的成绩。很多地区的蔬菜种植面积已经扩大，单位面积产量有了很大的提高。
    今年各地农业生产合作社提供给国家的蔬菜已比去年大大增加。今年上半年国家的蔬菜收购计划已超额12％完成。上半年马铃薯的收购计划也超额完成12％。现在全国有六百五十个农业生产合作社争取每霍尔特（合八点五五市亩）生产一百公担马铃薯。
    对首都布达佩斯和各工业城市的蔬菜和水果的供应有了很大的改善。例如，布达佩斯附近的佩斯州各农业生产合作社提供给首都的蔬菜和水果量就比去年增加了四倍。
    农业合作化为迅速发展蔬菜生产提供了广泛的可能性。萨伯尔齐—沙特马尔州在合作化以前，每年需要从外地买进一百多车皮蔬菜。但是，今年这个州在蔬菜方面不但可以自给自足，而且还可以出口。到目前为止，这个州已出口萝卜四十车皮、白菜五百车皮。
    新华社乌兰巴托15日电　蒙古各个牧区正在积极开展打草工作，为牲畜过冬贮备饲草。
    今年蒙古全国计划打草一百七十二万七千吨。在牧草生长旺盛的季节，各个农牧场、畜牧业机器站和合作社都分别在打草场开展打草工作。据9月初统计，全国已经打草六十四万一千多吨，完成计划的37.1％。
    开展打草工作较好的是苏赫巴托尔、中戈壁和科布多等省。苏赫巴托尔省的一些县、合作社和畜牧业机器站在8月下旬就已经完成了全年的打草计划。全省的其他合作社推广了上述合作社的打草经验，准备在最近完成打草任务。中戈壁、科布多省，已完成打草计划的70％以上。库苏古尔省发动合作社组织了二十五个打草队，在十天内就在一百二十五公顷打草场上打草一百多吨。中央省计划打草十七万吨，现在组织了六十七个青年打草队，准备在二十五天内完成任务。
    有一些地区在打草工作中组织竞赛，党和行政的负责人深入打草队帮助总结经验。戈壁阿尔泰省在畜牧业机器站和合作社各个打草队间由于展开了竞赛，提高了打草效率。
    比较干旱的巴彦洪果尔省不仅牧民打草的成效很高，同时还作了青贮饲料。
    新华社华沙14日电　据波兰通讯社报道：波兰中央统计局最近公布了今年6月份有关农业调查的最后结果。收集的资料表明，波兰农业发生了一系列有利的变化。特别在牲畜饲养方面有显著的变化。
    今年波兰的牲畜头数继续增长，增长的幅度大于1959年，总计增加了4％。同去年比较，不同点在于幼畜有更大的增长。集体农庄扩大了这一部分的牲畜繁殖，同1959年比较，总计增加了18％，国营农场增加了12％。
    根据调查资料，今年的猪的头数也有显著的增加，国营农场增加最多，增加了25％，集体农庄增加21％。
    播种面积的分布发生了许多变化。今年的谷物播种面积略有减少，而马铃薯、经济作物和饲料作物的播种面积有很大增加。
    今年玉蜀黍的播种面积增加为去年的三倍。集体农庄的甜菜种植面积增加了25％，国营农场增加了15％。个体农民的甜菜种植面积也比1959年增加了5％。
