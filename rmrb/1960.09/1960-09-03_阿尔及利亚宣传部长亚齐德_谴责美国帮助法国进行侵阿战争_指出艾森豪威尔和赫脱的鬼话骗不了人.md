Xinhua News Agency, Leopoldville, September 1st. Algerian Provisional Government Minister of Information Yazid today condemned the United States here for helping France in its war against the Algerian people.

At a press conference, Minister Yazid said that we must tell the world that the United States is helping France in the Algerian war. The French troops fighting in Algeria are equipped with American weapons, and these French troops have recently been able to replenish new artillery and other materials provided by the United States. The United States government has also provided France with a new batch of observation equipment and fighter jets. He said, "We have solid evidence that American technicians are stationed at the Boufarik and Boni airports (in Algeria), maintaining and repairing American aircraft given to France." Therefore, Yazid pointed out, "We are not only fighting France, but also the allies that provide it with weapons. These allies include the United States." He said that without the support of the United States, "We would have settled in Algeria long ago."

He said that US President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles claimed that they sympathized with the Algerians, but we do not believe these words.

Yazid said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is helping colonialists in Africa carry out conspiracies against the African people. He pointed out that NATO member states France and Belgium are supported by other countries of this organization.

Yazid came to Leopoldville to attend the conference of foreign ministers of independent African countries, which closed yesterday.

    阿尔及利亚宣传部长亚齐德
    谴责美国帮助法国进行侵阿战争
    指出艾森豪威尔和赫脱的鬼话骗不了人
    新华社利奥波德维尔1日电阿尔及利亚临时政府宣传部长亚齐德今天在这里谴责美国帮助法国进行反对阿尔及利亚人民的战争。
    亚齐德部长在记者招待会上说，我们必须告诉全世界，美国在阿尔及利亚战争中帮助法国。在阿尔及利亚作战的法国军队配备着美国武器，而且，这些法国军队最近可以补充美国提供的新大炮和其他物资。美国政府又提供给法国一批新的观察设备和战斗机。他说，“我们有确凿的证据知道美国技术人员驻在（阿尔及利亚的）布法列克和波尼机场，维护和修理给予法国的美国飞机”。因此，亚齐德指出，“我们不仅在同法国作战，而且同向它提供武器的盟国作战。这些盟国包括美国在内”。他说，法国如果没有美国的支持，“我们早在阿尔及利亚安顿下来了”。
    他说，美国总统艾森豪威尔和国务卿赫脱声称，他们同情阿尔及利亚人，但是，我们不相信这些话。
    亚齐德说，北大西洋公约组织帮助在非洲的殖民主义者进行反对非洲人民的阴谋。他指出，北大西洋公约的成员国法国和比利时得到这个组织的其他国家的支持。
    亚齐德到利奥波德维尔是来参加昨天闭幕的非洲独立国家外长会议的。
