Xinhua News Agency, Hefei - Workers at Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company are enthusiastically engaging in a production increase and thrift campaign, primarily focused on completing plans on a shift, daily, ten-day, and monthly basis. This has led to a 33% increase in steel production in the first ten days of September compared to the first ten days of August, an 11% increase in pig iron production, and a significant improvement in quality across the company.

Their production increase and thrift competitions take various forms, are lively and dynamic, and ensure that every task has a model. Furthermore, they have implemented three-shift evaluations. In the No. 2 workshop of the No. 1 Iron Smelting Plant, five medium-sized blast furnaces launched a "five brothers" opponent competition and a cooperation competition. The workers of No. 9 medium-sized blast furnace not only exceeded their work plans on a shift and monthly basis, becoming a model for medium-sized blast furnaces across the company, but also used the method of delivering treasures to share their advanced operating experience of "three highs" (high blast temperature, high blast volume, high load) and "three lows" (low sulfur, low silicon, low coke ratio) with their brother furnaces. Yang Shulin, the Party Branch Secretary of No. 12 and No. 13 medium-sized blast furnaces, personally led the furnace workers and three-shift foremen in studying and promoting the advanced experience of No. 9 furnace, determined to catch up with No. 9 furnace. Since the end of August, they have consistently exceeded their work plans by an average of 7% per day for half a month, and the quality of pig iron from each furnace has been excellent. The workers of the No. 5 workshop put forward the resounding slogan of "Work like fierce tigers, operate like embroiderers, everyone has great ambitions, every shift wears double flowers" in the competition, and in a very short time, they leaped to become an advanced workshop in converter steelmaking across the company.

They also widely launched technical performance competitions, from individual and single-task performances to large-scale joint performances across workshops and the entire factory, driving the production surge to new heights. The Electric Furnace Workshop of the General Machinery Repair Plant, addressing the situation of having many new workers, launched a key problem-solving performance competition. Foremen took the lead in demonstrating operations, and everyone participated in the performances. They not only overcame technical hurdles in a very short time, but also created a new record on September 5th, breaking the 100-ton mark in steel production and achieving a 100% qualification rate for steel since the furnace was built. The No. 1 workshop of the No. 1 Iron Smelting Plant launched a joint technical operation performance competition for "eight types of work" (furnace workers, hot blast workers, hoisting workers, raw material workers, weighing workers, blast workers, water watchers, ore washers), promoting a comprehensive leap forward in all aspects and exceeding work plans every day.

In the competition, the Party committees of various factories and mines paid special attention to strengthening the leadership of backward units and effectively helping them catch up with the advanced. For example, the Party Committee of the No. 1 Iron Smelting Plant sent Party Committee member Han Jingde to the backward No. 10 medium-sized blast furnace to specifically lead production, enabling the utilization coefficient of this furnace to exceed two, reaching the advanced level of medium-sized blast furnaces across the company.

    各找对手比增产　送宝上门传经验
    马钢钢铁产量齐跃进
    新华社合肥电　马鞍山钢铁公司职工在增产节约运动中，热烈开展以按班、按日、按旬、按月完成计划为主要内容的竞赛，促使全公司9月上旬钢产量比8月上旬增长33％，生铁产量增长11％，质量也有显著提高。
    他们的增产节约竞赛形式多种多样，生动活泼，事事有标兵，并且做到了三班评比。炼铁一厂二车间五座中型高炉展开了五兄弟对手赛、协作赛。九号中型高炉工人不仅按班、按月超额完成作业计划，成为全公司中型高炉的标兵，而且将自己的三高（高风温、高风量、高负荷）、三低（低硫、低矽、低焦比）的先进操作经验，用送宝上门的办法传授给兄弟高炉。十二号和十三号中型高炉的党支部书记杨守林亲自领导炉前工和三班工长学习推广九号炉的先进经验，立志赶九号炉，从8月底以来，连续半个月的时间平均每天超额7％完成作业计划，炉炉生铁质量优良。五车间职工在竞赛中提出了“干劲赛猛虎，操作如绣花，人人立大志，班班双戴花”的响亮口号，只经过很短时间，就一跃而为全公司转炉炼钢的先进车间。
    他们在竞赛中还广泛展开了技术表演赛，从一个人、一个工种的单项表演到全车间、全厂的大联合表演，推动生产热潮一浪高过一浪。机修总厂电炉车间针对新手多的情况，展开了攻关表演赛，工长带头作示范操作，人人参加表演。他们不仅在很短时间内攻克技术关，而且在9月5日创造了钢产量突破百吨、钢的合格率达到100％的建炉以来最高纪录。炼铁一厂一车间开展“八工种”（炉前工、热风工、卷扬工、原料工、司磅工、鼓风工、看水工、洗矿工）联合技术操作表演赛，推动各个环节全面跃进，每天超额完成作业计划。
    在竞赛中，各厂矿党委都特别注意加强后进单位的领导，切实帮助它们赶上先进。例如炼铁一厂党委派党委委员韩敬德到后进的十号中型高炉具体领导生产，使这个炉子的利用系数突破了二，达到了全公司中型高炉的先进水平。
