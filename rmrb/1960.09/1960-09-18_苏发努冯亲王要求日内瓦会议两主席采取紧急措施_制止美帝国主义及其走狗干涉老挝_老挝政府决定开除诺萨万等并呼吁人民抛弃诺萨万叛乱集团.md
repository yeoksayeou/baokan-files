Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 17th. Radio broadcasts from the Laotian Combat Forces report that Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, wrote to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and all participating countries on September 16th, condemning US imperialism and its lackeys in Thailand and South Vietnam for blatant interference in Lao internal affairs. He demanded that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and the governments of all participating countries pay attention to the extremely serious situation created by the acts of aggression against Laos by the US aggressors and their lackeys in Thailand and South Vietnam.

Prince Souphanouvong resolutely demanded in the letter: "(1) The two chairmen should take emergency measures to stop the acts of aggression against Laos by the US aggressors and their lackeys in Thailand and South Vietnam, first of all, to immediately stop inciting the Phoumi Nosavan group to attack Vientiane; (2) The two chairmen, in accordance with the responsibilities they have assumed, should take appropriate and effective measures to ensure the stabilization of the Lao situation on the basis of respecting the 1954 Geneva Agreement on Laos and the Vientiane Agreement, and respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Laos, and to ensure that Laos can follow the genuine policy of peaceful neutrality solemnly declared by the legitimate government of the Kingdom of Laos headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma."

The letter pointed out that the people and army of Vientiane, under the leadership of the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le, rose up on August 9th to overthrow the pro-American government of Chao Somsanith-Phoumi Nosavan, marking a new development in the Lao people's movement to save the country.

The letter said that the legitimate government, approved by the National Assembly and the King, with Prince Souvanna Phouma as Prime Minister, had solemnly declared its determination to implement a policy of peaceful neutrality and national harmony, which is in line with the spirit of the Geneva Accords on Laos and the sincere wishes of all the Lao people.

The letter pointed out, however, that the US imperialist aggressors have by no means given up their aggression against Laos. On September 10th, it instructed the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum group to form a so-called "Revolutionary Committee" and, in the name of this organization, arrogantly announced the dissolution of the legitimate government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma and the abolition of the current constitution of the Kingdom. More dangerously, the US aggressors and the reactionary authorities in Thailand and South Vietnam are actively providing the Phoumi Nosavan group with US dollars, weapons, aircraft, and other war materials made in the United States. They have sent secret delegations to discuss coordinating their actions with the aforementioned traitorous groups.

The letter said that several noteworthy events are: In recent days, Ngo Dinh Nhu's brother Ngo Dinh Can and four escorts were sent to Pakse; Nosavan frequently contacted and held talks with the Thai police commander and deputy commander of the Mekong River border area; Thailand has also sent many officers as advisors to Phoumi Nosavan, instructing and helping Nosavan to realize his plans, and through Thai territory and the Mekong River, has been helping Nosavan to mobilize troops by land and water.

The letter revealed that "the most concrete evidence of their open interference in Laos is that at two o'clock in the morning on September 16th, an army of Phoumi Nosavan, including Thai officers and soldiers, used the Thai military base opposite Vientiane to shell and land in our capital for the first time."

The letter emphasized that the nature of the above-mentioned actions of the US imperialist aggressors and their lackeys is particularly serious. It is not only trampling on the Lao people's desire for peaceful neutrality and national harmony, infringing on Laos' sovereignty and territorial integrity, and completely violating the provisions of the 1954 Geneva Agreement on Laos and the Vientiane Agreement, but also directly threatening peace in all of Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The letter concluded, "We firmly believe that for the sake of peace in Laos, Indochina, and the entire Southeast Asian region, the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Laos and the governments of all participating countries will wisely, resolutely, and promptly fulfill our above-mentioned urgent appeal."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 17th. According to a broadcast from Vientiane Radio today, the Lao Royal Government issued an appeal on September 16th, calling on all Lao people to resolutely abandon Phoumi Nosavan.

The appeal stated that the Lao government, at a meeting held on September 15th under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Phouma, had decided to expel Deputy Prime Minister Phoumi Nosavan and Minister of Economy Leuam Insisiengmay because they did not return to Vientiane to take office but cooperated with the "Revolutionary Committee" in Savannakhet. The Kingdom government led by Prince Phouma called on all people, staff, and the army not to listen to them.

The appeal stated that the Savannakhet group sent people to hide in Vientiane to carry out sabotage activities, such as destroying the radio station in Phonkheng and the water tower in Hathumchan, and also sent people to attempt to assassinate important figures in the Kingdom of Laos.

The appeal concluded, "Please think about who is plotting to provoke war between the Lao people, alienate the Lao people, and cause suffering to the Lao people." We must resolutely abandon them, and only when this rebel group cannot realize their conspiracy can our people live a peaceful life."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 17th. According to a broadcast from Vientiane Radio today, the Lao Royal Cabinet held a meeting on the afternoon of the 15th under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Phouma. The meeting decided that from September 15, 1960, Phoumi Nosavan and Leuam Insisiengmay would no longer be members of the government.

The broadcast said that the meeting considered that although the government had repeatedly appealed to Lao Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior, Religious Affairs, Social Affairs, and Relief Phoumi Nosavan and Minister of Economy Leuam Insisiengmay to return to Vientiane to take office, they still did not return. Therefore, the cabinet meeting unanimously made the above decision. The broadcast said that the government would issue a formal decree on this matter.

The meeting also passed some decrees related to various departments, as well as a decree to amend Article 15 of the Fourteenth National Assembly Election Law of February 5, 1960. According to Article 15 of the National Assembly Election Law, all staff participating in the election must be suspended from their duties for one year (without pay). The amended new decree stipulates that all unelected staff who were suspended from their duties during the election will be reinstated.

    苏发努冯亲王要求日内瓦会议两主席采取紧急措施
    制止美帝国主义及其走狗干涉老挝
    老挝政府决定开除诺萨万等并呼吁人民抛弃诺萨万叛乱集团
    新华社河内17日电　据寮国战斗部队电台广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王在16日写信给日内瓦会议两位主席和日内瓦会议所有参加国，谴责美帝国主义和它在泰国和越南南方的走狗明目张胆地干涉老挝内政，并且要求日内瓦会议两主席和所有参加国政府注视由于美国侵略者以及它在泰国和越南南方的走狗侵略老挝的行为所造成的极其严重的局势。
    苏发努冯亲王在信中坚决要求：“（一）两位主席采取紧急措施来制止美国侵略者以及它在泰国和越南南方的走狗侵略老挝的行为，首先是立即制止唆使富米·诺萨万集团进攻万象的行为；（二）两位主席根据本身所承担的职责，采取适当的有效措施，以便在尊重1954年关于老挝的日内瓦协议和万象协议、尊重老挝主权和领土完整的基础上，保障老挝局势稳定下来，保障老挝能够遵循以梭发那·富马亲王为首相的合法的老挝王国政府曾经郑重宣布的真正的和平中立政策。”
    这封信指出，万象人民和军队8月9日在以贡勒大尉为首的政变委员会的领导下奋起推翻了昭·松萨尼特—富米·诺萨万亲美政府，标志着老挝人民救国运动的新发展。
    信中说，得到国民议会通过和国王批准的合法政府——以梭发那·富马亲王为首相的政府，曾经郑重宣布决心实现和平中立和民族和睦政策，这个政策是符合关于老挝的日内瓦决议的精神，符合全体老挝人民的恳切愿望的。
    信中指出，然而，美帝国主义侵略者远没有放弃对老挝的侵略活动。9月10日，它指使富米·诺萨万—文翁集团成立了一个所谓“革命委员会”，并以这个组织的名义蛮横地宣布解散以梭发那·富马亲王为首相的合法政府，宣布毁弃王国现行宪法。更危险的是，目前，美国侵略者和泰国及越南南方反动当局正在积极向富米·诺萨万集团提供美元、武器、飞机和美国制的其它战争物资。它们派遣了秘密的代表团去同上述叛国集团商谈同它们配合行动的问题。
    这封信说，值得注意的几个事件是：近几天来，吴庭艳的兄弟吴庭瑾和四名随从人员被派到巴色市；诺萨万同泰国警察指挥官、湄公河边界地区副总指挥经常接触进行会谈；泰国还派许多军官充当富米·诺萨万的顾问，指使和帮助诺萨万实现他的计划，并通过泰国的领土和湄公河，从水、陆两路帮助诺萨万调动军队。
    这封信揭露说，“他们公开干涉老挝的最具体的证据是：9月16日早晨二时，有泰国官兵参加的富米·诺萨万的一支军队，使用了万象市对岸的泰国军事基地，首次向我们的首都进行开炮和登陆”。
    信中强调指出，美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗上述行动的性质特别严重。它不仅是蹂躏了老挝人民和平中立、民族和睦的愿望，侵犯了老挝的主权和领土完整以及完全违背了1954年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议和万象协议的各项条款，而且还直接威胁到全印度支那和东南亚的和平。
    这封信最后说，“我们坚信，为了老挝、印度支那和整个东南亚地区的和平，1954年关于老挝问题的日内瓦会议两位主席和所有参加国政府将会明智地、坚决地、及时地满足我们上述迫切的呼吁。”
    新华社河内17日电　据万象电台今天广播，老挝王国政府9月16日发表呼吁书，呼吁全体老挝人民坚决抛弃富米·诺萨万。
    呼吁书说，老挝政府9月15日在富马首相主持下举行的会议，已经决定开除副首相富米·诺萨万和经济大臣仑·英锡相迈，因为他们不返回万象受职，而同沙湾拿吉的“革命委员会”合作。富马亲王领导的王国政府呼吁全体人民、职员、军队，不要听从他们的话。
    呼吁书说，沙湾拿吉集团派人躲在万象，进行破坏活动，如破坏丰康地方的广播电台和哈敦占地方的自来水塔等，并且还派人企图暗杀老挝王国的重要人物。
    呼吁书最后说，“请同胞们想一想，是谁阴谋挑起老挝人之间的战争、离间老挝人、使老挝人痛苦。”我们必须坚决抛弃他们，只有在这个叛乱集团不能实现他们的阴谋的时候，我们人民才能过安宁的生活。”
    新华社河内17日电　据万象电台今天广播，老挝王国内阁15日下午在富马首相的主持下举行了会议。会议决定，从1960年9月15日起，富米·诺萨万和仑·英锡相迈不再是政府的成员。
    广播说，会议认为，尽管政府已经多次吁请老挝副首相兼内务、宗教、社会、救济部大臣富米·诺萨万和经济大臣仑·英锡相迈回万象就职，但他们仍旧不回来，因此，内阁会议一致作出了上述决定。广播说，政府将就这个事件颁布正式的法令。
    会议还通过了有关各部的一些法令，以及修改1960年2月5日第十四号国会选举法第十五条的法令。据国会选举法第十五条规定，参加竞选的所有职员必须停职一年（无薪）。修改后的新法令规定，在选举期间停职的所有未当选议员的职员都将复职。
