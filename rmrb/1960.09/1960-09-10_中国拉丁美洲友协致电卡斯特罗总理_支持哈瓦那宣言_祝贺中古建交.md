Xinhua News Agency, September 9th. The China-Latin America Friendship Association today sent a telegram to Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro, warmly supporting the "Havana Declaration" passed by the Cuban People's National Assembly, and warmly congratulating the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cuba. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

"The 'Havana Declaration' passed at the Cuban People's National Assembly in Havana on September 2nd, under your leadership, is a powerful counterattack against US imperialism and the so-called 'Declaration of San José' it manufactured. This declaration concentrates the firm will and heroic spirit of the Cuban government and people and the people of Latin American countries to defend the Cuban revolution and oppose US imperialism. The China-Latin America Friendship Association expresses its heartfelt respect to you and the Cuban people and the people of Latin American countries. We warmly praise and support the 'Havana Declaration'.

"When we learned that you solemnly announced Cuba's severance of all relations with the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique and the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people felt heartfelt joy. The China-Latin America Friendship Association and the 650 million Chinese people extend our warmest congratulations to you and the Cuban people.

"The establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the People's Republic of China on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is in line with the wishes and interests of the Chinese and Cuban people. The friendly relations between the people of China and Cuba will enter a newer stage from now on. Although China and Latin America are separated by vast oceans, the hearts of the Chinese people and the Cuban people and the people of Latin American countries are linked together. We will always support each other in the struggle against our common enemy—US imperialism. We firmly believe that the heroic Cuban people, under the leadership of the Cuban government and with the support of progressive mankind all over the world, will surely defeat US imperialism's aggression and interference against Cuba and march from victory to victory."

Xinhua News Agency, September 9th. The All-China Women's Federation today sent a telegram to Mrs. Vilma Espín Guillois de Castro, President of the Federation of Cuban Women, welcoming the news of Prime Minister Castro's announcement of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba and China.

The telegram from the All-China Women's Federation said: "Chinese women, together with the Chinese people, learned with great joy the news that Prime Minister Castro solemnly announced the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China at the Cuban People's National Assembly.

"The 'Havana Declaration' passed by the Cuban People's National Assembly shows the firm will and heroic spirit of the Cuban people and the Latin American people to resolutely strike at US imperialism and get rid of the shackles of US imperialism.

"We would like to express our sincere admiration and respect to the heroic Cuban people and women.

"US imperialism single-handedly manufactured the 'Declaration of San José' in an attempt to suppress the Cuban and Latin American national democratic revolutionary movements, but the heroic Cuban people gave US imperialism a head-on blow, putting forward the just principle that Latin America belongs to the Latin American people and not to the Americans, and powerfully exposed the robber-like crimes of US imperialism in interfering in Cuba and controlling Latin America. The Chinese people and women firmly support the just struggle of our Cuban brothers and sisters, and will make unremitting efforts to develop and consolidate the militant friendship between the people and women of our two countries. Let us unite more closely, support each other, and fight together to overthrow US imperialism."
