Xinhua News Agency, New York, 18th: The United Nations General Assembly began an emergency meeting on the evening of the 17th to discuss the situation in the Congo. Because the Security Council meeting the previous day failed to pass a resolution favorable to the US aggression against the Congo due to opposition from the Soviet Union and other countries, the United States insisted on convening this emergency meeting in order to use its voting machine to force the General Assembly to pass a resolution favorable to the US's intensified efforts to swallow the Congo by using the United Nations.

The US representative, Wadsworth, tried his best to start the discussion on the Congo situation before many newly independent African countries had participated. He played a trick, suggesting that the meeting first discuss the issue of admitting some newly independent African countries as members of the United Nations, conspiring to have the General Assembly hastily make a decision to admit these countries as members of the United Nations and then immediately turn to the discussion of the Congo situation, so that before the representatives of these countries could arrive in New York to participate in the meeting, the United States could manipulate the General Assembly to pass resolutions favorable to the United States. This conspiratorial trick of the United States was opposed by the Soviet Union and some Asian and African countries. Soviet representative Zorin said that admitting new members of the United Nations at the emergency meeting was only meaningful if these countries could participate in the work of the United Nations. The Soviet delegation therefore requested a postponement of the discussion on the issue of admitting new member states. Guinean representative Kaba-Sory then proposed a motion to postpone the discussion on this issue, which was passed with forty-three votes in favor.

After the vote, the President of the General Assembly, Belaunde (Peru), announced that the meeting would turn to the discussion of the Congo situation. Belaunde's decision aroused dissatisfaction among many representatives, as it also meant excluding many newly independent African countries from the discussion. However, Belaunde, in accordance with the wishes of the United States, insisted on starting the discussion and hastily called on the US representative to speak.

The US representative, Wadsworth, immediately spoke, trying his best to peddle to the General Assembly the US plan to intensify the aggression against the Congo by using the United Nations. He reiterated some of the positions that the United States had put forward at the Security Council meeting, shamelessly demanding that member states provide "financial contributions" to the activities of the "United Nations forces" under US control in interfering in the Congo, and supporting the so-called "principle" that the United Nations "must be the sole source of external assistance to the Congo." Wadsworth tried his best to praise the United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, who was running around for the US conspiracy to control the Congo, and clamored to prohibit any so-called "unilateral actions" that "might hinder the United Nations' efforts in the Congo." Soviet representative Zorin then spoke, denouncing the US conspiracy to use the United Nations to invade the Congo and Hammarskjöld's role as an accomplice.

Zorin pointed out that the United States and other colonial countries hated the Lumumba government to the bone, and the United States was taking the lead in carrying out conspiracies and subversive activities against the young African country of the Congo. The reason for this hatred was that the Lumumba government bravely implemented the policy of consolidating its national independence and getting rid of the oppression of the Belgian colonialists and other colonialists, including the United States. The patriotic policy of the Lumumba government threatened the positions of the colonial countries, including the United States, which was single-mindedly trying to control the Congo's rich resources, in the Congo.

The Soviet representative went on to say that this group, headed by the United States, was using the "United Nations Forces" Command and United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld himself to achieve its goals. The "United Nations Forces" Command and the Secretary-General spared no effort to strangle the young Republic of the Congo. They betrayed the lofty ideals of the United Nations, and therefore no trickery could help them escape the verdict of history. The Soviet representative thoroughly exposed the nature of the activities of the United Nations Secretary-General and his special representatives in the Congo. He pointed out that the result of the activities of the "United Nations Forces" Command and the Secretary-General was that the territorial integrity of the Republic of the Congo had not only not been restored, but was facing a greater threat than two months ago.

Zorin said that the Secretary-General had become a participant in a farce in the form of direct crime. Now the Secretary-General wants to slip away and watch with sympathy the final scene of the play planned by the United States and other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in which the Secretary-General plays a certain, not small, role. The Soviet government firmly believes that Mr. Hammarskjöld's actions are essentially linked to the policies of countries that have consistently adhered to a colonialist position in the past and present.

Zorin also sternly refuted the US representative's slander against the Soviet Union. Zorin emphasized that a small group of monopolists in certain countries get rich by plundering and exploiting the people of other countries. As for the Soviet Union, it will not seek any interests, any wealth, any rights or privileges in African countries, nor will it seek any bases in African countries.

The Italian representative spoke in support of the US representative. After his speech, the meeting ended. The next meeting will be held at 15:00 New York time on September 18.

    联合国大会召开紧急会议讨论刚果局势
    苏联代表谴责美国颠覆刚果政府罪行
    揭露哈马舍尔德在这一罪恶活动中充当帮凶
    据新华社18日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会17日晚上开始举行紧急会议讨论刚果局势。因为在安全理事会前一天的会议上由于苏联等国的反对没有通过有利于美国侵略刚果的决议，美国就硬要求召开这个紧急会议，目的是利用它的表决机器强使大会通过有利于美国加紧利用联合国来鲸吞刚果的决议。
    美国代表华兹沃斯在发言时竭力要在许多刚独立的非洲国家没有参加的情况下，就开始讨论刚果局势。他玩弄了一个手法，就是建议会议先讨论接纳非洲一些新独立国家为联合国会员国的问题，阴谋使大会在匆匆作出接纳这些国家为联合国会员国的决定后就立即转入对刚果局势的讨论，以便在这些国家的代表还来不及到纽约参加会议的情况下，美国就操纵大会通过有利于美国的决议。美国这种阴谋手法遭到苏联和一些亚非国家的反对。苏联代表佐林说，在紧急会议上接纳联合国新会员国，只有在这些国家能够参加联合国工作的情况下才有意义，苏联代表团因此要求延期讨论接纳新会员国问题。几内亚代表卡巴—索里接着提出一项提案，建议延期讨论这个问题，这个建议以四十三票赞成获得通过。
  在表决后，大会主席贝朗德（秘鲁）宣布会议转入对刚果局势的讨论。贝朗德这个决定引起许多代表不满，因为它同样意味着要把许多非洲新独立国家排除在讨论以外。但是秉承美国意旨的贝朗德硬要开始讨论，并且匆匆叫美国代表发言。
    美国代表华兹沃斯立即发言，竭力向大会兜售美国加紧利用联合国来侵略刚果的计划。他重申美国在安全理事会会议上提出过的一些主张，无耻地要求各成员国对美国控制的“联合国军”干涉刚果的活动提供“财政贡献”，并且支持所谓联合国“必须是对刚果提供外界援助的唯一来源”的“原则”。华兹沃斯竭力赞扬为美国控制刚果的阴谋奔跑的联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，并且叫嚷要禁止任何所谓“可能阻挠联合国在刚果的努力”的“单方面行动”。苏联代表佐林接着发言，斥责美国利用联合国来侵略刚果的阴谋和哈马舍尔德的帮凶作用。
    佐林指出，美国和其他殖民国家对卢蒙巴政府恨之入骨，美国正带头对刚果这个年青的非洲国家施展阴谋和颠覆活动。产生这种仇恨的原因是：卢蒙巴政府勇敢地执行了要巩固本国独立、摆脱比利时殖民主义者，而且还有包括美国在内的其他殖民主义者的压迫的方针。卢蒙巴政府的爱国政策威胁到了殖民国家、其中包括一心想控制刚果富源的美国在刚果的阵地。
    苏联代表接着说，以美国为首的这个集团利用“联合国军”司令部和联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德本人来达到自己的目的。“联合国军”司令部和秘书长卖尽一切气力以便窒息刚果这个年青的共和国。他们出卖了联合国的崇高理想，因而任何花招都不能帮助他们逃脱历史的判决。苏联代表彻底揭露了联合国秘书长和他派驻刚果的特别代表的活动的性质。他指出，“联合国军”司令部和秘书长的活动的结局是：现在刚果共和国的领土完整不但没有恢复，而且遭到了比两个月以前更大的威胁。
    佐林说，秘书长已成为一出具有直接犯罪形式的滑稽戏的参加者。现在秘书长想要溜走，并以同情的眼光观看美国和北大西洋公约组织其他成员国策划的、由秘书长担任一定的、不小的角色的最后一场剧的演出。苏联政府坚决认为，哈马舍尔德先生的行动实质上是同过去和现在一直坚持殖民主义立场的国家的政策联系在一起的。
    佐林还严词驳斥了美国代表对苏联的诬蔑。佐林强调指出，某些国家的一小撮垄断资本家靠掠夺和剥削别国人民而发财致富。至于苏联，它不会在非洲国家寻找任何利益、任何财富和任何权利和特权，它也不会在非洲国家寻找任何基地。
    意大利代表发言支持美国代表。他发言后，会议结束。9月18日纽约时间十五点举行下一次会议。
