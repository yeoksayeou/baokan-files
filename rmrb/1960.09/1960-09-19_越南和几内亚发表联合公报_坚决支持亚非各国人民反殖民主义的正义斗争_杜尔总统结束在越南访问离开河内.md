Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th September: A joint communiqué issued by the government delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of Guinea was released here today.

The communiqué stated that President Sékou Touré of the Republic of Guinea, accompanied by Diallo Saïfoulaye, President of the National Assembly of the Republic of Guinea, and the government delegation of the Republic of Guinea, held talks with President Ho Chi Minh and other state leaders of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam during their visit to Vietnam. The two sides exchanged views on important international issues and issues of mutual interest. The talks took place in an atmosphere of mutual understanding, cordiality, and brotherhood, and both sides reached a consensus on the issues discussed.

The communiqué said that the two delegations were satisfied that the recent international situation is developing in a direction favorable to the peace movement, which is inseparable from the struggle of the colonial peoples to achieve national independence and demand the genuine exercise of their national sovereignty.

Both sides declared their support for all policies aimed at achieving complete disarmament, banning nuclear weapons, and abolishing military bases abroad.

The two delegations were pleased to note that the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have been developing at an unprecedented speed and scale in recent times. The two delegations extend their heartfelt respect to the countries that have recently won independence, especially the countries of Africa, and to the countries that are struggling for independence. The communiqué stated that the two delegations expressed their firm support for the just struggle of the fraternal Asian and African countries to end colonial exploitation and oppression and to win the right to live a free, peaceful, and equal life with all the nations of the world.

The communiqué said that in order to consolidate peace and ensure genuine national independence, the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world must unite and wage a resolute struggle to eliminate colonialism and oppose imperialism and all its sinister conspiracies. Both sides declared their full support for the just struggle of the Algerian people and firmly opposed the imperialist conspiracies to interfere in the internal affairs of Asian and African countries.

The communiqué pointed out that both sides believe that the current complex and chaotic situation in the Congo is caused by the imperialist blocs' conspiracy to cling to their selfish interests. Both sides believe that the internal affairs of the Congo must be decided by the Congolese people themselves. Imperialism has absolutely no right or reason to interfere in the internal affairs of the Congo, divide the territory of the Congo, and, under any circumstances and in any name, rudely violate the sovereignty of the Congo.

The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam expressed concern about the imperialist conspiracy to overthrow the legitimate government of Laos and maintain the divided state of Laos, which seriously threatens the peace and security of the nations of Indochina.

The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam highly appreciated the active role and important contributions of the Republic of Guinea to the national liberation movement in Africa and to the consolidation and development of Asian-African solidarity. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is pleased with the achievements made by the Republic of Guinea in its economic and cultural construction and sincerely wishes the Guinean people greater and more significant victories in their cause of consolidating independence and building the country.

The delegation of the Government of the Republic of Guinea was very pleased to be able to visit the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and pleased to see the achievements made by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in its national construction.

Both delegations agreed that the Geneva Agreements on Vietnam and Laos must be respected and the provisions on the unification of Vietnam must be strictly implemented. The delegation of the Government of the Republic of Guinea supports the efforts of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to peacefully unify the country.

Both delegations were satisfied that the relations between the two countries have developed well in the past, and that this relationship is based on the inherent friendship between the two nations, which is: standing in the large family of Asian and African countries, and equally hoping to unite in the spirit of Bandung to oppose imperialism and colonialism, consolidate independence, and build a happy life for the people.

Both sides believe that the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries and the exchange of ambassadors is a major event in the history of relations between the two countries.

Both delegations are particularly concerned with consolidating and developing the friendly and cooperative relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of Guinea, and expressed their agreement to take active measures to develop this relationship.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th September: President Sékou Touré and the government delegation of the Republic of Guinea he led, ended their visit to Vietnam, carrying with them the deep friendship of the Vietnamese people, and left Hanoi by special plane at 7:10 this morning.

President Ho Chi Minh was at the airport to see them off. He and President Touré delivered speeches at the airport, which constantly aroused warm applause from the crowd seeing them off.

President Ho Chi Minh said that although President Touré's visit to Vietnam was very short, it left a deep impression on the Vietnamese people. He said that President Touré's visit gave us the opportunity to exchange views on important issues related to Vietnam-Guinea relations, the Asian-African situation, and the international situation, and to reach a consensus.

President Ho said that President Touré's visit was a great contribution to the development of friendship between Vietnam and Guinea, to the solidarity of the peoples of Asia and Africa, and to the cause of defending world peace.

Finally, President Ho asked President Touré and other distinguished Guinean guests to convey the warm congratulations of the Vietnamese people to the fraternal Guinean people and the African people.

In his speech, President Touré first expressed his heartfelt thanks to President Ho Chi Minh, other leaders of the Vietnamese government, and the Vietnamese people for their warm and brotherly reception.

President Touré said that we have held close talks with the leaders of the Vietnamese government on issues related to our two countries and reached a consensus. He said that through the talks, we can see that the cooperative relationship between our two countries will be further strengthened in the future, and our two countries will make contributions to the great cause of world peace.

Also at the airport to bid farewell to the distinguished Guinean guests were: Truong Chinh, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Vietnamese National Assembly, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, Deputy Prime Ministers Pham Hung, Vo Nguyen Giap, Nguyen Duy Trinh, Le Thanh Nghi, Phan Ke Toai, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly Hoang Van Hoan, and heads of various departments of the government, various parties, and mass organizations.

Today, President Touré, accompanied by President Ho Chi Minh, rode in an open-top car to the airport in the morning light. Along the way, tens of thousands of people from all walks of life in Hanoi held the national flags of Vietnam and Guinea to welcome and bid farewell to the distinguished guests.

At the airport, after the band played the national anthems of Vietnam and Guinea, President Touré, accompanied by President Ho Chi Minh, reviewed the guard of honor and circled the field to bid farewell to the crowd. At this time, bursts of warm applause and cheers resounded in the airport.

When President Touré and other distinguished Guinean guests boarded the plane, the salute fired. The crowd, with reluctant feelings, waved to the distinguished guests. Diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Vietnam also went to the airport to see them off today.
