	The Glory of Collaboration
	Kong Sang
	In the first round of the increase production and practice economy movement, Anshan Iron and Steel (An'gang) adopted the method of "joint tackling key problems performance competition," launching a large-scale competition movement that comprehensively improved the production level of major products such as steel, iron, and coke. This competition was a product of the combination of economic work and political work, mass movement and enterprise management, and vigorous revolutionary drive and solid work style.
	An'gang is a large and complex joint enterprise. It is difficult to find a slightly important production problem in An'gang that is not related to other people or other units. In such an enterprise, no matter which person or unit wants to increase production, many people and many units must cooperate. "Joint tackling key problems performance competition" is a good form to adapt to the large-scale production increase of modern enterprise organizations. Here, organization and management work is very important. If the organization and management work is not done well, the enthusiasm of the masses may often not be brought into play, and the production potential of the enterprise will be difficult to fully tap. Many production potentials are directly hidden in the management work and in the cooperative relationship. Good management and good collaboration lead to good production; loopholes in management and insufficient collaboration will cause production problems.
	So, how to strengthen production management and improve production collaboration? We say that in order for management work to keep up with the development of production, we must follow the mass line, we must closely integrate it with political work, and we must use the method of vigorously carrying out mass movements to strengthen enterprise management. Under centralized leadership, the more thoroughly the masses are mobilized, the more perfect and consolidated the management system can be. An'gang used this method to organize mass offensives against key problems in current production, solving key problems one by one from the root and strengthening management work. This makes the enterprise management system in line with the requirements of production, and allows the vast masses to move forward under the same goal of besieging the key.
	The more vigorously we act, the more attention we must pay to being down-to-earth; the more down-to-earth we are, the more vigorously we can act. Organizing thousands of people to jointly solve a problem from dozens or hundreds of links, and arranging the respective responsibilities of all these people, requires meticulous and thorough organizational work. If every relevant link is not investigated clearly, if the overall situation is not fully understood, and if the details are not clearly observed, then the progress of the movement will not be rapid and in-depth. Similarly, without meticulous political and ideological work to enlighten the political consciousness of the workers, the workers cannot align themselves to the key to production in a unified manner. The success of An'gang's "joint tackling key problems performance competition" not only demonstrates the heroism of the vast number of combatants, their high degree of awareness and discipline, and their strong sense of overall situation and communist style, but also demonstrates the in-depth and meticulous reconnaissance and planning of the staff and commanders at all levels, and the correctness of their decision-making. Without this condition, the mass movement would not be so vigorous.
	The preliminary achievements of An'gang's "joint tackling key problems competition" are the result of large-scale collaboration and support from the broad masses. With the deepening of the increase production and practice economy movement and the greater development of the communist style of large-scale collaboration and support among the broad masses of workers and staff, greater harvests will surely appear.

	The workers of the Third Work Section of the First Iron and Steel Workshop of Changchun Steel Plant, in the "Hundred Furnaces Without Scrap Steel" competition, earnestly promoted the experience of advanced work sections, carried out technical revolution against the key to production, and created a high-yield and high-quality record of thousands of tons of scrap-free steel, becoming a red flag on the steel front of the province.

    协作的光辉	孔桑
    鞍钢在增产节约运动的第一个回合里，采取“联合攻关表演赛”的方法，掀起了一场规模宏大的竞赛运动，全面地提高了钢、铁、焦炭等主要产品的生产水平。这场竞赛，是经济工作和政治工作、群众运动和企业管理、轰轰烈烈的革命干劲和扎扎实实的工作作风相结合的产物。
    鞍钢是一个庞大复杂的联合企业。在鞍钢很难找出一个稍为重要的生产问题是不和其他的人、其他的单位发生关联的。在这样的企业里，无论哪一个人、哪一个单位要增产，都必须有很多的人、很多的单位协同动作。“联合攻关表演赛”正是适应现代化企业组织大幅度增产的好形式。这里，组织管理工作十分重要。组织工作和管理工作做不好，群众的干劲常常就可能发挥不出来，企业的生产潜力就很难充分挖掘出来，有很多生产潜力直接就藏在管理工作里，藏在协作关系里。管理得好，协作得好，生产就好；管理上有漏洞，协作不够好，生产就会出问题。
    那么，怎样加强生产管理、搞好生产协作呢？我们说，管理工作要跟上生产的发展，必须走群众路线，必须同政治工作紧密结合，必须用大搞群众运动的方法来加强企业管理。在集中领导下，群众发动得越彻底，管理制度就可以做到越完善，越巩固。鞍钢用这样的方法，针对当前的生产关键问题，组织群众性的进攻关键问题的竞赛，一个一个地、从根本上来解决关键问题，加强管理工作。这就使企业管理制度切合生产的要求，使广大群众的步伐在围攻关键的同一目标下前进。
    越是轰轰烈烈，就越要注意扎扎实实，越是扎扎实实，也就能做到更加轰轰烈烈。组织成千上万的人从几十个成百个环节上来共同解决一个问题，并且要安排所有这些人各自应负的责任，如果没有细致周密的组织工作，不把每一个有关的环节都侦察清楚，对全局了如指掌，对细节明察秋毫，那么，运动的进展就不可能迅速和深入；同样，如果没有细致的政治思想工作，启发职工群众政治自觉，那末，职工群众也不可能步调一致地对准生产关键。鞍钢这次“联合攻关表演赛”的成功，不仅表明了广大战斗员的英勇，有高度的自觉性和纪律性，有强烈的整体观念和共产主义风格，而且也表明了参谋部和各级指挥员侦察筹划的深入细致和决策的正确。没有这个条件，群众运动是不会轰轰烈烈的。
    鞍钢“联合攻关竞赛”的初步成绩，是广大群众大协作、大支援的结果；随着增产节约运动的深入开展和广大职工群众之间的大协作、大支援的共产主义风格的更大发扬，必将出现更大的丰收。（附图片）
    长春市钢厂第一铁钢车间第三工段职工，在“百炉无废钢”竞赛中，认真推广先进工段经验，针对生产关键大闹技术革命，创造出千吨无废钢的高产优质纪录，成为全省钢铁战线上的一面红旗。
