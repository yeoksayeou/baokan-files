High Yields and Multiple Crops
——The Correct Policy for High-Speed Grain Production Zhang Tinggan

Yunnan Province's grain production has achieved continuous bumper harvests over the past decade. Especially in the Great Leap Forward years of 1958 and 1959, the people of the entire province, holding high the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, launched a great mass movement to conquer nature and tap into the potential for increased production, resulting in even greater increases in grain output throughout the province. By last year, Yunnan's grain production had already doubled compared to the early post-liberation period. In order to continue increasing grain production at high speed, the Provincial Party Committee this year summarized Yunnan's grain production experience over the past decade, especially since the Great Leap Forward, and analyzed the province's natural characteristics and the objective laws of agricultural production. It was determined that this year's grain production must continue to implement the policy of combining "high yields and multiple crops." It is necessary to vigorously increase yields per unit area and actively expand planting areas. At the same time, the Provincial Party Committee thoroughly analyzed the various subjective and objective favorable conditions in this year's agricultural production, estimated the various natural disasters and unfavorable factors that might be encountered, and formulated "three lines of defense" to seize a bumper grain harvest this year. The policy of combining high yields and multiple crops was specifically applied to this year's agricultural production, becoming a huge force for mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses and giving full play to their subjective initiative. In the past six months, the resolute implementation of the policy of resolutely pursuing high yields and multiple harvests, and resolutely pursuing multiple crops and harvests, and focusing on the "three lines of defense" have already achieved great victories in agricultural production. After arduous efforts, the people of all ethnic groups overcame a severe drought that lasted more than eight months and planted more than 20 million mu of high-yield crops according to the seasons and relatively advanced quality standards. Then, they redoubled their efforts to sow 20 million mu of "multiple crops and harvests" of autumn crops and nearly 10 million mu of late autumn crops. This has greatly expanded this year's large-area high-yield crops compared to previous years, and the total sown area has also expanded by nearly 20% compared to previous years. After overcoming the drought and completing the planting work, the people of all ethnic groups also extinguished the largest pest infestation in the ten years since liberation, protecting the seedlings. Through comprehensive and meticulous field management, the 20 million mu of high-yield crops, which are decisive for this year's grain production, are generally growing better than in previous years. Currently, the southern region of the Yunnan plateau is covered in gold, and the people of all ethnic groups are starting the first autumn harvest battle of the 1960s with infinite joy, waving their sickles and taking to the field.

The experience of seizing bumper grain harvests over the years, especially this year, shows that the two-pronged approach of combining high yields and multiple crops is the correct policy that suits Yunnan's specific conditions. Yunnan's agricultural production has many favorable natural conditions and great potential. However, there are also some unfavorable conditions, such as excessive concentration of rainfall, with only four or five months of rainy season each year and a dry season lasting seven or eight months. Therefore, the problem of water is the key problem for Yunnan's agricultural production over the years. Ten years of experience have proven that in Yunnan Province, whether it is rice, corn, or sweet potatoes, as long as there is water for irrigation, ensuring that most areas can be planted before the Start of Summer or Grain Full, and taking corresponding measures such as timely fertilization, deep plowing, and rational close planting, high yields are certain. In order to create conditions for high yields, Yunnan Province has paid attention to water conservancy construction for many years. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, mass campaigns for water conservancy construction have been launched continuously, and water conservancy construction has greatly developed. In 1958 and 1959, the irrigated area of water conservancy projects was about 2 million mu each year. By the end of last year, the area of paddy fields with water conservancy guarantees in the province had increased from more than 4 million mu in the early post-liberation period to more than 12 million mu. While continuously expanding the irrigated area, the province has conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production, which has significantly improved grain yields per unit area and created many typical examples of large-area continuous high yields. The typical counties and communes with large-area high yields have provided relatively systematic high-yield experiences. However, at present, the yields per unit area in the province are still very uneven. Some counties, people's communes, management areas, and production teams have extensive cultivation and low yields per unit area. It can be envisioned that if the problem of water conservancy is gradually solved in these areas with low yields per unit area in the future, and advanced experience is conscientiously promoted, and the "Eight-Character Charter" is implemented, striving to achieve high yields and multiple harvests in batches, then a better leap forward in grain production can be achieved. This situation shows that Yunnan Province still has great potential to tap in terms of increasing the yield per unit area of existing cultivated land. The harvest of high yields and multiple harvests from basic farmland with water conservancy guarantees will account for the vast majority of the province's total grain output this year. Therefore, high yields and multiple harvests are the main, basic, and most reliable aspects of grain production in Yunnan Province; grasping high yields and multiple harvests is the primary task on Yunnan's agricultural front. Neglecting to increase the yield of existing cultivated land and failing to make efforts to grasp high yields and multiple harvests will not be conducive to the continued leap forward in grain production. In fact, it is precisely because Yunnan has concentrated its main manpower and material resources from beginning to end to resolutely grasp the 20 million mu of large-area high-yield farmland with water conservancy guarantees that it has continuously overcome the successive severe droughts and serious insect infestations, and seized a decisive victory in grain production.

In order to increase grain production in every possible way, in addition to ensuring large-area high yields in basic farmland with water conservancy guarantees, it is also necessary to expand the cultivated area as much as possible and actively strive for multiple crops and harvests. The experience of previous years has proven that water conservancy is the first prerequisite for high grain yields in Yunnan. Generally speaking, only under the condition of water irrigation, and then through intensive cultivation and meticulous management, is it possible to achieve relatively stable high yields. In order to obtain the water conservancy conditions necessary for this stable high yield, the people of Yunnan have built a large number of water conservancy projects, and the newly added irrigation area has reached more than 10 million mu. However, at present, Yunnan Province has only 12 million mu of paddy fields and 8 million mu of irrigated land with water conservancy guarantees. Obviously, relying solely on the grain produced by these 20 million mu of basic farmland cannot meet the needs of people's lives and socialist construction. And in many areas, especially the mountainous areas of Yunnan, it is not possible to solve the water conservancy problem quickly. At the same time, because agricultural production at present mainly relies on animal power cultivation and manual operation, it is also not possible to implement intensive cultivation and comprehensive high yields on all cultivated land. In addition, in today's situation where people cannot completely control nature, agricultural production is still affected by natural conditions, and the yield per unit area of grain still has a certain degree of instability, especially in Yunnan, where various natural disasters such as drought, floods, waterlogging, wind, hail, and beasts are relatively frequent. Even if there are no province-wide major disasters, small-area interspersed disasters may occur frequently. Under such conditions, grain production must take multiple lines of defense and grasp multiple hands in order to strive to complete or overfulfill the plan under any conditions. Therefore, in order to strive to produce as much grain as possible, it is necessary to expand the planting area as much as possible and strive to plant more. Multiple crops can lead to multiple harvests; only by maintaining a certain sown area is it possible to truly achieve "finding it there if you lose it here" when grain production is attacked by unexpected natural disasters.

Yunnan Province has extremely advantageous natural conditions for developing agricultural production. About half of the province belongs to the temperate zone, and crops can be harvested twice a year; about one-third of the area belongs to the subtropical zone, and most crops can be harvested three times a year; and about 20% of the area belongs to high-altitude mountainous areas with cold temperatures, and crops can also be harvested three times in two years. However, these favorable natural conditions have not yet been fully utilized. There are large tracts of fertile wasteland everywhere in Yunnan, and the existing cultivated land area accounts for only about 7% of the province's total area. After several years of vigorous development, the average is still only more than two mu and seven fen of land per person. These situations fully show that Yunnan Province not only urgently needs to expand the cultivated area and implement multiple crops and harvests, but also has many realistic and favorable conditions for further tapping natural potential and expanding planting area. Yiliang County, where the population is concentrated and the land area is small, has an average of only more than one mu of cultivated land per person in the county. However, in recent years, the county has vigorously increased yields per unit area, making the average rice yield per mu reach more than 800 jin, and the average corn yield per mu reach more than 300 jin. Last year, the county reached an average of more than 1,000 jin of grain per person according to the population. Lanping County, located in the northwest Yunnan plateau, has relatively extensive cultivation due to limited conditions, and the average yield per unit area last year was only more than 300 jin. However, this county adapted to local conditions and focused on grasping multiple crops and harvests. In recent years, the county has expanded the cultivated land area by more than 150,000 mu. Last year, calculated according to the population, the average grain per person exceeded 1,000 jin. Facts have proven that all counties that have resolutely grasped high yields and multiple harvests and resolutely grasped multiple crops and harvests, and adopted the "two-pronged approach," have achieved greater increases in grain production. Lijiang County is the best example. In recent years, Lijiang County has not only done a good job in high yields and multiple harvests, increasing the yield per unit area of basic farmland in the county by nearly doubled, but also grasped multiple crops and harvests, expanding the cultivated land area by more than 80%. Therefore, the county's grain production has increased greatly year after year, and it has become a county with the largest average per capita production of commodity grain in Yunnan Province. On the contrary, those individual places that have neither grasped high yields and multiple harvests nor grasped multiple crops and harvests have also experienced the slowest rate of grain growth. Because the broad masses have truly realized from years of experience that high yields and multiple harvests and expanding the planting area and implementing multiple crops and harvests are effective methods for increasing grain production in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, they have shown great enthusiasm for implementing the policy of combining high yields and multiple harvests.

Now, the autumn harvest season has begun to arrive on the Yunnan plateau, and the people of all ethnic groups in the southern and central regions are carrying out intensive autumn harvest work in large-area high-yield fields. They have generally proposed guarantees, determined to do a good job in the quality of the autumn harvest, and achieve a bumper harvest. At the same time, the people of the entire province are resolutely responding to the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and have launched a new upsurge of the whole party and the whole people running agriculture and grain production in a big way. The province, from cities to villages, has already transferred hundreds of thousands of strong laborers to the agricultural front. Cadres of all ethnic groups and the broad masses of commune members are determined to continue to implement the policy of combining high yields and multiple harvests, tap natural potential in every possible way, actively develop and utilize Yunnan's fertile land, strive to develop agriculture faster, increase grain production more, and make more contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    高产多收与多种多收
    ——高速度增产粮食的正确方针	张廷干
    云南省的粮食生产，十年来获得了连续丰收。特别是大跃进的1958、1959两年，全省人民高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，展开了征服自然、挖掘增产潜力的伟大的群众运动，使全省的粮食产量获得了更大幅度的增产。到去年为止，云南的粮食产量已经比解放初期增加了一倍左右。为了继续高速度地增产粮食，省委今年总结了云南十年来，特别是大跃进以来的粮食生产经验，分析了全省的自然特点和农业生产的客观规律。认为今年的粮食生产，必须继续贯彻“高产多收”与“多种多收”相结合的方针。既要大力提高单位面积产量，又要积极扩大种植面积。同时，省委周密地分析了今年农业生产上的各种主观与客观有利条件，估计到可能遇到的各种自然灾害和不利因素，制定了夺取今年粮食丰收的“三道防线”，把高产多收与多种多收相结合的方针，具体运用到今年的农业生产中去，成为调动群众积极性、发挥群众主观能动作用的巨大力量。半年来，积极贯彻坚决高产多收、坚决多种多收方针，大抓“三道防线”，已经在农业生产方面取得了很大的胜利。各族社员经过艰苦努力，战胜了长达八个多月的严重干旱，把二千多万亩大面积高产作物按照节令和比较先进的质量标准，抗旱栽种下去。接着又鼓足干劲，播种了二千万亩“多种多收”的大秋作物和近千万亩晚秋作物。使今年的大面积高产作物比往年大大扩大了，播种总面积也比往年扩大了将近20％。在战胜干旱完成栽种工作以后，各族社员又扑灭了解放十年来最大的一次虫害，保住了禾苗。经过全面细致的田间管理，对今年粮食生产具有决定意义的二千万亩大面积高产作物，普遍生长得比往年更好。目前，云南高原南部地区已经遍地金黄，各族社员们正以无限喜悦的心情，挥镰上阵，开始了六十年代第一个秋收战役。
    多年来，特别是今年夺取粮食丰收的经验说明，高产多收与多种多收相结合的两条腿走路的方针，是适合云南具体情况的正确方针。云南的农业生产，有利的自然条件很多，潜力很大。但是，也有一些不利的条件，如雨量过份集中，每年只有四、五个月的雨季，旱季长达七、八个月。所以，水的问题，是云南历年农业生产的关键问题。十年的经验证明，云南省无论是水稻、包谷或红薯，只要有水灌溉，保证大部分地区能在立夏或小满节令以前栽种下去，并且采取相应的措施，如适时施肥、实行深翻和合理密植等等，就一定能够高产。为了创造高产条件，云南省多年来就注意了兴修水利，特别是1958年大跃进以来，连续掀起了群众性兴修水利的高潮，水利建设已经有了很大的发展。1958、1959两年，每年兴修水利的灌溉面积，都在二百万亩左右。到去年年底，全省有水利保证的水田面积，已经由解放初期的四百多万亩增加到一千二百多万亩。在不断扩大灌溉面积的同时，全省认真贯彻了农业生产的“八字宪法”，使粮食单位面积产量有显著提高，创造了许多大面积连片高产的典型。大面积高产的典型县、社，都提供了比较系统的高产经验。但是，目前全省的单位面积产量还很不平衡。有些县、人民公社、管理区和生产队，耕作粗放，单产较低。可以设想，今后如果在这些单产较低的面积上逐步解决水利问题，认真推广先进经验，贯彻“八字宪法”，争取分批达到高产多收，就一定可以实现粮食生产的更好跃进。这种情况说明，云南省在提高现有耕地的单位面积产量方面，仍然大有潜力可挖。今年的粮食生产，有水利保证的基本农田高产多收的收获量将占全省粮食总产量的绝大部分。所以，高产多收是云南省粮食生产的主要的、基本的和最可靠的一方面；大抓高产多收，是摆在云南省农业战线上的首要任务。忽视提高现有耕地的产量，不去努力大抓高产多收，就不利于粮食生产的继续跃进。事实上，云南今年正是由于自始至终集中主要人力、物力坚决抓好了两千万亩有水利保证的大面积高产田地，才连续战胜了接踵而来的严重干旱和严重虫灾，夺取了粮食生产的决定性胜利。
    要千方百计地增产粮食，除了确保有水利保证的基本农田大面积高产之外，还必须尽可能地扩大耕地面积，积极争取多种多收。历年的经验证明：水利是云南粮食高产的第一个前提。一般说来，只有在有水灌溉的情况下，再经过精耕细作和精细的管理，才有可能达到比较稳定的高产。为了获得这种稳定高产所必需的水利条件，云南人民已经兴修了大批水利工程，新增的灌溉面积达一千多万亩。但是，目前云南省有水利保证的基本农田，毕竟只有一千二百万亩水田和八百万亩水浇地。单单依靠这两千万亩基本农田所生产的粮食，显然不能满足人民生活和社会主义建设的需要。而在不少地区，特别是云南山区，还不可能很快解决水利问题。同时，由于目前的农业生产还主要是依靠畜力耕种和人工操作，也还不可能在全部耕地面积上实行精耕细作，实行全面高产。此外，在今天人还不能完全控制自然的情况下，农业生产还受着自然条件的影响，粮食的单位面积产量还有着一定程度的不稳定性，特别是在云南，旱、洪、涝、风、雹、兽等各种自然灾害比较频繁，即使没有全省性的大的灾害，而小面积的插花灾害也可能经常出现。在这种条件下，粮食生产必须采取多道防线、多抓几手的办法，才能争取在任何条件下都能完成或超额完成计划。因此，要力争尽可能地多打粮食，就有必要尽可能地扩大种植面积，力争多种一些。多种才能多收；只有保持一定的播种面积，才可能在粮食生产受到意外自然灾害侵袭时，真正做到“这里丢了那里找”。
    云南省发展农业生产，有着极为优越的自然条件。全省约有一半地区属于温带，农作物可以一年两熟；有三分之一左右的地区属于亚热带，农作物大都可以一年三熟；另有20％左右的地区属于气温冷的高寒山区，农作物也可以二年三熟。但是，这些有利的自然条件，目前还远远没有被充分利用起来。云南到处都有大片肥沃的荒地，现有耕地面积，只占全省总面积的7％左右。经过几年来的大力开发，现在平均每人仍然只有二亩七分多田地。这些情况充分说明，云南省目前不仅迫切需要扩大耕地面积，实行多种多收，而且也具备着进一步挖掘自然潜力、扩大种植面积的许多现实的有利条件。人口集中、土地面积较少的宜良县，全县平均每人只有一亩多耕地。但是，几年来这个县狠狠提高了单位面积产量，使稻谷平均亩产达到八百斤以上，苞谷平均亩产三百斤以上。去年，全县按人口平均达到每人有粮千斤以上。地处滇西北高原的兰坪县，由于条件限制，耕作较粗放，去年全县平均单位面积产量才三百多斤，但是，这个县因地制宜，着重抓好多种多收，几年来全县扩大耕地面积十五万多亩，去年按人口平均计算，每人有粮超过了一千斤。事实证明：凡是既坚决抓好了高产多收，又坚决抓好了多种多收，采取“两条腿走路”的方针的县，粮食的产量就得到更大幅度的增长，?江县就是一个最好的例子。几年来，?江县既搞好了高产多收，使全县基本农田的单位面积产量增加了近一倍；又抓好了多种多收，扩大了耕地面积80％以上。因此，这个县粮食连年大增产，已成为云南全省按人口计算平均每人生产商品粮食最多的一个县。反之，那些既没有抓好高产多收，又没有抓好多种多收的个别地方，则粮食增长的速度也最缓慢。由于广大群众从多年的经历中，真正体会到高产多收和扩大种植面积、实行多种多收是多、快、好、省地增产粮食的有效方法，因而对贯彻执行高产多收与多种多收相结合的方针，表现了极大的热情。
    现在，秋收时节已经开始来到云南高原，南部和中部地区各族社员正在大面积高产田里，展开紧张的秋收工作。他们普遍提出保证，决心搞好秋收质量，做到颗粒还家、丰产丰收。同时，全省人民正坚决响应党中央和毛主席的伟大号召，掀起了全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的新高潮。全省从城市到农村，各行各业已经抽调了几十万精壮的劳动力奔赴农业战线。各族干部和广大社员们决心继续贯彻执行高产多收与多种多收相结合的方针，千方百计挖掘自然潜力，积极开发和利用云南的肥沃土地，争取更快地发展农业，更多地增产粮食，为祖国的社会主义建设作出更多的贡献。
