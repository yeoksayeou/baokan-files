Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 24th. According to Soviet press reports, there are now over two million workers, staff members, and collective farm members studying in night schools and correspondence schools in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has a total of twenty-four correspondence higher education institutions, nine night universities, and four hundred and thirty correspondence departments and two hundred and forty night school departments attached to higher education institutions throughout the country.

    The Soviet Union attaches great importance to the development of night schools and correspondence schools. They are one of the main teaching forms in Soviet national education. In the past two years, Soviet night schools and correspondence schools have developed rapidly. The number of students in higher correspondence schools alone has increased from more than 700,000 in 1957 to more than one million, which is more than five times the total number of students in higher correspondence schools in 1946. In the 1960-1961 academic year, Soviet higher education institutions enrolled a total of 550,000 students, half of whom studied in night schools and correspondence schools, which is more than the total number of correspondence students in Soviet higher education institutions in 1940.

    In order to meet the current need for rapid cadre training, the Soviet Union has carried out a series of reforms in night school and correspondence school education since the end of 1958. One of the important contents of the reform is to expand night schools and correspondence schools from large cities to various industrial and agricultural areas, or to establish night school departments or correspondence departments in industrial and agricultural areas. For example, in the past, most of the higher correspondence schools were concentrated in large cities such as Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev. Now, correspondence schools have begun to be established in various border regions and industrial and agricultural areas. The areas that are developing particularly fast are the eastern regions of the Soviet Union – the Far East, Siberia, and Central Asia. With the help of enterprises and social organizations in the oil-producing regions of the Tatar and Bashkir Autonomous Republics, the Moscow Petroleum and Gas Industry Institute established a night school department in Almetyevsk and certain specialized departments in Bugulma and Leninogorsk. Opening secondary or higher technical vocational night schools and correspondence schools directly in large industrial enterprises is also one of the main measures of this reform. For example, the Ural Machinery Plant has opened a night engineering college, and the Moscow Likhachev Automobile Factory has also opened a specialized night school for automobile equipment manufacturing. These measures allow students to receive tutoring from teachers locally, without having to travel long distances to other cities to take exams during the exam period, and can greatly improve teaching quality.

    At present, some higher night schools and correspondence schools in the Soviet Union have begun to work according to the new teaching program. This new teaching program includes two stages. The first stage (grades one to three) focuses on learning general science and technology knowledge; the second stage (grades four to six) specializes in professional studies.

    Soviet night schools and correspondence schools train a large number of cadres for the country every year. This year, the higher night schools and correspondence schools in the Russian Federation have trained approximately 70,000 engineers, teachers, agronomists, and construction workers for the country. This year, the Ukrainian Republic has formulated a fifteen-year plan for training secondary agricultural specialists for collective farms and state farms, and the main method of training is through correspondence education. In the next fifteen years, Ukraine will train 400,000 agronomists, mechanics, soil improvement workers, and others. This year, Ukraine's 128 agricultural correspondence secondary technical schools enrolled 13,000 rural youths, which is twice the number of rural youths participating in correspondence school studies in 1959.

　　为国家培养更多建设干部　使工农得到学习便利条件
　　苏联大量发展夜校和函授学校
　　学生人数已达二百多万　教学方面进行了一系列改革
    新华社莫斯科24日电　据苏联报刊报道：苏联现在有二百多万工人、职员和集体农庄庄员在夜校和函授学校学习。苏联全国共有二十四所函授高等学校、九所夜大学，以及附设在各地高等学校的四百三十个函授部和二百四十个夜校部。
    苏联很重视夜校和函授学校的发展。它们是苏联国民教育中的主要教学形式之一。近两年来，苏联夜校和函授学校的发展很快。单是高等函授学校的学生就由1957年的七十多万增为一百多万，等于1946年高等函授学校学生总数的五倍多。在1960—1961学年中，苏联高等学校共招生五十五万人；其中就有一半在夜校和函授学校学习，这比1940年苏联高等学校函授学生的总数还要多。
    为了适应当前迅速培养干部的需要，苏联自1958年底到现在在夜校和函授学校教育方面进行了一系列的改革。改革的重要内容之一就是将夜校和函授学校由大城市扩大到各个工业区和农业区，或者在工、农业区设立夜校部或函授部。例如，过去高等函授学校大部分集中在莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅等大城市，现在函授学校已开始在各边疆区及工、农业区设立。发展特别快的是苏联东部地区——远东、西伯利亚和中亚细亚。莫斯科石油瓦斯工业学院在石油产区——鞑靼和巴什基尔自治共和国各企业和社会团体的帮助下，在阿尔密皆夫斯克设立了夜校部，并在布古利马和列宁戈尔斯克设立了某些专门科系。直接在大工业企业中开设中等或高等技术专科夜校和函授学校，也是这一改革的主要措施之一。例如，乌拉尔机器工厂开办了夜工学院，莫斯科李哈乔夫汽车工厂也开设了汽车设备制造专科夜校。这些措施可以使学生就地得到教师的辅导，不必在考试期间远路赶到其他城市去考试，并可以大大提高教学质量。
    目前，苏联有些高等夜校和函授学校已开始按新的教学程序工作。这种新的教学程序包括两个阶段，第一个阶段（一—三年级）是集中学习一般科学和技术知识；第二个阶段（四—六年级）专门学习专业。
    苏联夜校和函授学校每年为国家培养大批干部。今年，俄罗斯联邦的高等夜校和函授学校为国家培养了大约七万名工程师、教师、农艺师和建筑工作者。乌克兰共和国今年制定了为集体农庄、国营农场培养中等农业专家的十五年计划，而培养方式主要是通过函授教育。在今后十五年内，乌克兰要培养农艺师、机械师和土壤改良工作者等四十万名。今年乌克兰的一百二十八所农业函授中等技术学校招收了一万三千名农村青年，这等于1959年农村青年参加函授学校学习的人数的两倍。
