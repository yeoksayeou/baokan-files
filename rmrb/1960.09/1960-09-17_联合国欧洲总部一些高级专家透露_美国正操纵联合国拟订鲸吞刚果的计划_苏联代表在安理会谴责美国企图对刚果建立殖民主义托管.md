Xinhua News Agency, September 16th—According to a report by the Associated Press yesterday from Geneva, the United Nations, manipulated by the United States, is currently drafting a large-scale infiltration and long-term control plan for Congo in order to ultimately establish a new American colonial rule in Congo.

The information revealed by this news agency comes from some senior experts at the United Nations headquarters in Europe. These experts say that the plan being drafted by the United Nations is intended to equip each minister of the Congolese government with a United Nations "advisor" as his "assistant" in the name of so-called "on-the-job training" for Congolese government officials over a period of ten to fifteen years. It is said that these "advisors" will "obey" the orders of their "superiors," but exceptions can be made when their orders "contradict the principles of the United Nations."

The news indicates that this control will be "promoted" from the upper leadership to "various departments and levels of the Congolese government."

The sources revealed that this aggressive proposal was put forward by United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, who has been working for the United States to control Congo. Its purpose is to plug the "gap" in the collapse of the Belgian colonial system in Congo and "rebuild" this colonial system under American control.

Xinhua News Agency, September 16th—New York: The United Nations Security Council continued its meeting yesterday morning to discuss the Congo issue. U.S. Representative Wadsworth stated at the meeting that the United States would continue to use the United Nations to promote its conspiracy to swallow Congo.

Wadsworth felt that the United Nations' current interference in Congo's internal affairs and violation of Congo's sovereignty were still insufficient. He said that the United Nations "still has a lot to do in Congo." He said that the United States "fully supports" the decision made by the United Nations forces command, manipulated by the United States, to close all airports, ports, radio stations, and other communication equipment in Congo, which is a serious violation of Congo's national sovereignty. He clamored, "We believe these are the minimum measures and are clearly within the scope of the United Nations' mission. If similar situations occur in the future, we hope to see such clear actions again."

He also said that the United States is prepared to "encourage" United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, who has been repeatedly condemned by the Congolese government for assisting the American invasion of Congo, to formulate a large-scale "aid" plan for Congo.

Wadsworth had to admit in his speech that the American plan to swallow Congo through the United Nations is at a "crossroads" of success or failure under the exposure and condemnation of world justice and public opinion. However, he said that the United States would never be reconciled to the failure it has suffered. He said, "The United States has been fully supporting the efforts made here in the Security Council while providing indispensable material support."

On the one hand, Wadsworth promoted the American plan to invade and enslave Congo under the guise of "aid" through the United Nations. On the other hand, he smeared the selfless assistance given by the Soviet Union to help the truly legitimate government of Congo maintain its national territorial integrity and domestic order, saying that this was "individual interference" in the "dangerous situation" in Congo. He clamored that any assistance to Congo must be "through the United Nations."

The U.S. representative then presented the draft resolution on the Congo issue prepared by the United States for the Security Council. In this draft resolution, the United States demanded that other countries "provide funds" for the American-manipulated United Nations' aggression in Congo and reiterated that the "United Nations forces" should take action in Congo "to restore and maintain law and order for the maintenance of international peace and security."

This aggressive stance of the United States was supported by representatives of its Western allies and vassal states. British Representative Dean slandered the political life of Congo as being in a state of "chaos." He said that he believed that there was no authority other than the United Nations that could resolve the situation in Congo.

At the end of the afternoon meeting, Soviet Representative Zorin spoke again, pointing out that the United States is using the flag of the United Nations in an attempt to control Congo. Zorin stated that the Soviet Union has opposed and will continue to oppose this attempt, and it will not allow the United States to use the United Nations to achieve a rule that is conducive to strengthening colonialism.

The Soviet representative analyzed the U.S. proposal in detail. He emphasized that passing the U.S. proposal would actually mean establishing a colonial trusteeship over independent Congo.

The Soviet representative pointed out that the U.S. proposal completely ignored the legitimate government of Congo and attempted to establish a government in Congo that the United States desired. He stated that the Soviet delegation would vote against the U.S. proposal.

The Soviet representative then put forward the Soviet proposal, demanding the immediate cessation of all forms of interference in the Republic of Congo and the revocation of the current "United Nations forces" command in Congo.

After the Soviet representative's speech, the Security Council announced a recess, and the next meeting was scheduled for the 16th.

    联合国欧洲总部一些高级专家透露
    美国正操纵联合国拟订鲸吞刚果的计划
    苏联代表在安理会谴责美国企图对刚果建立殖民主义托管
    新华社16日讯　据美联社昨天从日内瓦发出的消息透露，受美国操纵的联合国目前正在拟订一项大规模渗入和长期控制刚果的计划，以便最后在刚果确立美国新的殖民主义统治。
    这家通讯社所透露的消息是来自联合国在欧洲总部的某些高级专家。这些专家们说，联合国正在草拟的这项计划，准备在十年到十五年内在所谓“现场训练”刚果政府官员的名义下，为刚果政府的每一个部长配备一个联合国的“顾问”作为他的“助手”。据说，这些“顾问”将“服从”他的“上司”的命令，但是当他们的命令同“联合国的原则发生矛盾”时却可以例外。
    消息表明，这种控制将从上层领导一直“推广”到“刚果政府的各个部门和等级”。
    提供消息的人士透露，这套侵略性的主张是由一直替美国控制刚果卖力的联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德提出来的。它的目的是要堵住比利时在刚果的殖民主义体系垮台的“缺口”，使这个殖民体系在美国控制下“重建”起来。
    新华社16日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会昨天上午继续开会讨论刚果问题。美国代表华兹沃斯在会上表示美国要继续利用联合国来推行鲸吞刚果的阴谋。
    华兹沃斯对联合国目前干涉刚果内政，侵犯刚果主权的种种行动仍嫌不足，他说，联合国“要在刚果做的事情仍有很多”。他说，美国“完全赞成”由美国操纵的“联合国军”司令部所作出的封闭刚果全国机场、港口和广播电台及其他通讯设备的严重侵犯刚果国家主权的决定。他叫嚷说，“我们认为这些是最低限度的措施，显然在联合国的任务范围以内。如果今后发生类似情况，我们希望再一次看到这种明确的行动。”
    他还说，美国准备“鼓励”因为协助美国侵略刚果已经受到刚果政府一再谴责的联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德制订一项大规模“援助”刚果的计划。
    华兹沃斯在讲话中不得不承认，美国这种通过联合国鲸吞刚果的计划，在世界正义舆论揭露和谴责下，正处于成败的“十字路口”。但是他表示，美国决不甘心它所遭到的失败，他说，“美国一直在全力支持安全理事会这里所作的努力，同时提供不可缺少的物资支援”。
    华兹沃斯一方面推销美国通过联合国在“援助”的幌子下侵略和奴役刚果的计划，另一方面又诬蔑苏联为帮助刚果真正合法政府维护国家领土主权完整和国内秩序而给予的无私援助，他说什么这是对刚果“危险局面”的“单独干涉”。他叫嚷对刚果的任何援助都必须“通过联合国”。
    美国代表接着提出了美国就刚果问题为安理会准备的决议案。美国在这个决议案中要求其他国家为美国操纵的联合国在刚果的侵略活动“提供款项”，并且重申要“联合国军”在刚果采取行动“来恢复和维持为维护国际和平与安全的法律和秩序”。
    美国的这种侵略立场得到它的西方盟国和仆从国家代表的支持。英国代表迪安诬蔑刚果的政治生活已是“一派混乱”。他说，他认为除了联合国以外，不再有任何权威能够解决刚果的局势。
    在下午会议结束时，苏联代表佐林再次发言。指出美国正在利用联合国的旗帜，企图控制刚果。佐林表示，苏联过去和将来都反对这种企图，它不允许美国利用联合国来实现有利于加强殖民主义的统治。
    苏联代表详细地分析了美国提出的提案。他强调指出，通过美国提案实际上就意味着建立对独立的刚果的殖民主义托管。
    苏联代表指出，美国提案完全无视刚果合法政府，并且企图在刚果建立美国所希望的政府。他表示，苏联代表团将投票反对美国的提案。
    苏联代表接着提出了苏联提案，要求立即制止对刚果共和国的各种形式的干涉，并且撤销目前在刚果的“联合国军”司令部。
    苏联代表讲话后安理会宣布休会，下次会议定于16日举行。
