    Understanding the Urgent Needs of Communes, Revising Factory Support Plans
    Shenyang Conducts In-Depth Inspection of Agricultural Support Work
    (Our newspaper, Shenyang, 31st dispatch) Under the leadership of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, over 700 responsible cadres from factories, enterprises, and schools in Shenyang City recently formed 92 work groups based on the Agricultural Support Grassroots Committee. They went deep into the rural people's communes they were assigned to support, conducting a comprehensive review of agricultural support work since the beginning of this year. This unprecedented large-scale inspection not only made agricultural support work more meticulous and practical, but also further encouraged the enthusiasm of all sectors of society to support agriculture.
    Over 800 people participated in this major inspection, including party committee secretaries, factory (institute) directors, and engineering technicians from factories, enterprises, and schools. In about half a month, they widely solicited opinions and requests from commune cadres and members regarding support work through collective discussions, individual interviews, and key visits. They investigated the situation of agricultural technology transformation and problems in the support work. Based on the commune's agricultural technology transformation plans and urgent production needs, they revised the support plans and helped the communes solve some pressing problems in current production.
    During the inspection, they lived and ate with the commune members and participated in summer harvesting, autumn planting, and pest control, which was warmly praised by the majority of commune cadres and members.
    One of the major achievements of this inspection was a clearer understanding of the current urgent needs of agricultural technology transformation and rural production, making the agricultural support plans of all sectors more targeted and practical. For example, the Agricultural Support Grassroots Committee, led by the Shenyang Gas Compressor Factory, originally did not consider helping the commune solve the problem of autumn harvest tool reform in its support plan. After conducting a specific investigation in the Dagu Jiazi People's Commune in Faku County, they found that the shortage of autumn harvest tools was a major problem for the commune. Therefore, they decided to help the commune reform and manufacture seven types of mechanized and semi-mechanized autumn harvest tools, including rice harvesters, corn harvesters, rice threshers, sorghum threshers, and grain storage and transportation machines, before the autumn harvest this year, and incorporated them into the support plan. Another example is that the comrades who went to the Fujia People's Commune in Tai'an County found that some seedlings were not growing well, mainly due to a lack of fertilizer. Therefore, they decided to focus on helping the commune to vigorously develop local fertilizer as one of the key support projects.
    Before revising the support plans in accordance with the urgent needs of the countryside, the responsible cadres of the participating units also studied the commune's agricultural technology transformation plans together with the commune cadres and members, helping the commune to remove unrealistic parts of the plans and adding some new content, so that the commune's plans and the support plans of all sectors were more closely integrated.
    Because this major inspection timely solved some problems in the agricultural support work, the support work became more and more perfect. For example, the responsible cadres of the Sino-Czech Friendship Factory, which supports the Liangshan Commune in Xinmin County, found during the inspection that the commune's machine repair factory, which had already been built, could not fully play its role due to insufficient technical strength and imperfect technical management. Based on this situation, in addition to deciding to help the commune accelerate the training of technical personnel, they immediately sent the technical director of their factory to the commune to be stationed there and help solve technical problems. Through this inspection, the responsible cadres of many units realized that support for agriculture must be carried out to the end, so that the support work can play its due role.
    Shenyang City has made great achievements in supporting agriculture in all sectors. The organizational form of supporting agriculture has also developed from the original factory-commune pairing to the formation of agricultural support grassroots committees with industry as the main body, which has brought the work of supporting agriculture into a new stage of being planned, led, and purposeful. With the in-depth development of the mass movement to support agriculture, the requirements for supporting agriculture are becoming more detailed and in-depth. To this end, the Municipal Party Committee decided that all units should universally go deep into the front line of support work, absorb the experience of the previous two inspections, and conduct a more comprehensive major inspection.
    This major inspection has now basically ended. According to the effectiveness and experience of several inspections, the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that this method of regularly going to the countryside to inspect support work is of great significance for promoting the work of supporting agriculture, strengthening urban-rural ties, and raising the awareness of urban and rural people. Therefore, it has decided to make this regular inspection of support work in the countryside a regular system.

    了解公社急迫需要　修订工厂支援规划
    沈阳深入检查支援农业工作
    本报沈阳31日电　沈阳市七百多个工厂、企业和学校的负责干部，在中共沈阳市委的领导下，最近以支援农业基层委员会为单位组成九十二个工作组，分别深入挂钩支援的农村人民公社，对今年以来支援农业的工作进行了全面的检查。通过这次空前规模的大检查，不仅使支援农业的工作更加细致和切合实际，而且也进一步鼓舞了各行各业支援农业的积极性。
    参加这次大检查的工厂、企业、学校的党委书记、厂（院）长和工程技术人员等共八百多人。他们在半个月左右的时间里，采取集体座谈，个别访问，重点参观等办法，广泛地征求了公社的广大干部和社员对支援工作的意见和要求，调查了农业技术改造的情况和支援工作中的问题，并根据公社的农业技术改造规划和生产的迫切需要，修订了支援农业的规划，帮助公社解决当前生产中一些急需解决的问题。
    他们在检查工作中，同社员住在一起，吃在一起，并参加了夏收、秋种、灭虫等劳动，受到了广大公社干部和社员的热烈称赞。
    这次大检查的重大成果之一，是进一步摸清了当前农业技术改造和农村生产的迫切需要，使各行各业支援农业的规划更有目的性和更加切合实际。例如，以沈阳气体压缩机厂为主的支援农业基层委员会，原来的支援规划没有考虑帮助公社解决秋收工具改革的问题；这次到法库县大孤家子人民公社具体调查后，发现公社秋收工具不足是个大问题，于是决定在今年秋收前帮助公社改革和制造水稻收割机、玉米收割机、水稻脱谷机、高粱脱粒机、粮食入库运输机等七种机械化和半机械化秋收工具，并纳入了支援规划。再如到台安县富家人民公社去的同志，在劳动中，发现有些禾苗生长不好，主要是因为缺少肥料，于是决定把帮助公社大搞土化肥，作为支援的重点项目之一。
    参加检查工作的各单位负责干部，在结合农村急迫需要修订支援规划之前，还同公社干部和社员一起，研究了公社农业技术改造规划，帮助公社去掉了规划中不切合实际的部分，增添了一些新的内容，这样就使公社的规划和各行各业支援规划结合得更加紧密。
    由于通过这次大检查，及时的解决了支援农业工作中的一些问题，使支援工作越做越完善。如支援新民县梁山公社的中捷友谊厂的负责干部，在检查中发现公社因技术力量不足和技术管理不完善，使已经建设起来的机修厂不能充分发挥作用。根据这一情况，他们除决定帮助公社加速培养技术力量外，还立即派本厂技术厂长去公社长驻，帮助解决技术问题。通过这次检查，不少单位的负责干部都体会到：支援农业一定要负责到底，这样才能使支援工作发挥应有的效果。
    沈阳市各行各业在支援农业方面做出了很大成绩；支援农业的组织形式，也由原来的厂社挂钩发展到以工业为主体组成支援农业基层委员会，使支援农业的工作进入有计划、有领导、有目的的新阶段。随着支援农业的群众运动深入发展，要求支援农业的工作更细致深入。为此市委决定要各单位普遍深入支援工作第一线，吸收过去两次检查的经验，进行一次更全面的大检查。
    这次大检查目前已基本上结束。中共沈阳市委根据几次检查的效果和经验，认为这种经常下乡检查的办法，对于推动支援农业的工作，加强城乡联系、提高城乡人民的觉悟，都有很大意义，因此决定把这种定期下乡检查支援工作定为一项经常的制度。
