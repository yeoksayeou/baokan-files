Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: Chairman Liu Shaoqi's speech at the airport to bid farewell to President Sékou Touré of the Republic of Guinea. The full text is as follows:

Your Excellency respected President Sékou Touré of the Republic of Guinea, distinguished guests of the Guinean government delegation, friends, comrades:

Today, our respected friend, His Excellency President Sékou Touré, and the distinguished guests of the Guinean government delegation are about to leave Beijing, and we are here to bid you farewell with infinite reluctance. At this moment of parting, please allow me, on behalf of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, to once again express our heartfelt gratitude for your friendly visit.

Your Excellency Mr. President, although your visit to our country was short, it left us with unforgettable profound friendship. Through cordial and friendly talks, we have achieved results of great significance. Our two countries have jointly issued a joint communiqué and signed the Sino-Guinean Treaty of Friendship, an agreement on economic and technical cooperation, and a trade and payment agreement. All of this marks a new stage in the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Guinea.

Your Excellency Mr. President, you are now about to leave Beijing for friendly visits to other cities in our country. You will be warmly welcomed by the Chinese people everywhere you go. The common struggle against imperialism has linked the people of our two countries together. Now, the people of our two countries are working hard for the construction of our respective motherlands. I firmly believe that our descendants will inherit and carry on this friendship from generation to generation. The future of the people of our two countries is infinitely bright and great. Mr. President, the Chinese people sincerely thank you for bringing the friendship of the Guinean people. I ask you to convey the sincere friendship and cordial greetings of the 650 million Chinese people to the Guinean people and the African people.

I wish you a safe journey!

I wish Your Excellency the President and all distinguished guests good health!

Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Guinean people!

Long live the friendship between the Chinese and African people!

Long live Asian-African solidarity and friendly cooperation!

Long live world peace!
