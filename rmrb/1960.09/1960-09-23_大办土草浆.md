Vigorously developing indigenous grass pulp is a fundamental policy issue for the high-speed development of the paper industry. In the first half of this year, 310,000 tons of indigenous grass pulp were produced nationwide, powerfully supporting the development of the paper industry.

There are many benefits to vigorously developing indigenous grass pulp: it can transform scattered grass resources into paper pulp locally, which can then be centrally used for paper making; it can improve transportation efficiency and save chemical raw materials; it can strengthen cooperation between workers and peasants and establish fixed supply relationships; it can be combined with the current "one dragon" approach to processing agricultural and sideline products to engage in comprehensive utilization and diversified operations, fully utilizing various resources.

Practice has proven that mobilizing small paper mills or handmade paper mills in rural areas to produce commercial paper pulp is the best way to accelerate paper pulp production. Most small paper mills are built in raw material producing areas, with small output, making it easy to concentrate raw materials. They already have the technical and material foundation for producing indigenous grass pulp. The Baodi County Paper Mill in Hebei Province produced 1,250 tons of commercial indigenous grass pulp from January to August this year, supporting Tianjin. If all the small paper mills in rural areas across the country produced commercial pulp like the Baodi County Paper Mill, what a considerable figure that would be!

Vigorously developing indigenous grass pulp is a new thing, with infinitely broad development prospects. We hope everyone will pay attention to its development and growth.

　　大办土草浆
    大办土草浆，是高速度发展造纸工业的一个带根本性的方针问题。今年上半年全国各地生产了三十一万吨土草浆，有力地支援了造纸工业的发展。
    大办土草浆的好处很多：它能将分散的草类资源，通过就地制浆，然后集中起来造纸；它能提高运输效率，节约化工原料；它能加强工农协作，固定供应关系；它能和当前农副产品加工一条龙大搞综合利用多种经营结合起来，充分利用各种资源。
    实践证明，发动农村中的小型纸厂或手工纸厂生产商品纸浆，是加快纸浆生产的最好办法。小型纸厂大部分建设在原料产地，产量小，原料容易集中，他们已具有生产土草浆的技术与物质基础。河北省宝坻县纸厂今年1至8月期间就生产了一千二百五十吨商品土草浆，支援了天津市。全国农村中的小型纸厂如果都像宝坻县纸厂一样的生产商品浆，那是多么可观的数字啊！
    大办土草浆是一件新生事物，有着无限广阔的发展前途，希望大家重视它的发展和壮大。
