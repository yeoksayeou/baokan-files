    Massively Launch the "Small Autumn Harvest" Campaign

    Wild plants all over the mountains and plains are maturing one after another, and the harvest season is coming. While strengthening autumn field management, we should make full preparations, mobilize the masses, rationally arrange time, and launch a "small autumn harvest" campaign on a larger scale than last year, to collect, process, and utilize wild plants in large quantities.
      The "small autumn harvest" is an important part of the big autumn harvest. Achieving a great victory in the "small autumn harvest" is of great significance for increasing social wealth, ensuring the sustained leap forward of the national economy, and increasing the income of people's communes and their members. The tremendous achievements of last year's "small autumn harvest" movement are powerful proof. The amount of wild plant raw materials collected by various regions in the short period of last year's "small autumn harvest" movement greatly exceeded the amount collected in the first nine months of the same year, and also greatly exceeded the amount collected in the entire year of 1958. This is a major victory for the Chinese people in their march towards nature. The "small autumn harvest" movement provided the state with a large amount of industrial raw materials. Various regions also used wild plants to make a large amount of means of production (various farm tools, baskets, straw bags, ropes, etc.) and means of livelihood (non-staple foods, cultural goods, and daily necessities, etc.), which strongly supported agricultural production and water conservancy construction, and met the needs of the market. The "small autumn harvest" movement further promoted the development of rural people's commune-run industries and increased the income of communes and their members. In Jianhe County, Guizhou, the average per capita income increase during last year's "small autumn harvest" movement was higher than the income from agricultural production. Of course, Jianhe County is a mountainous area with extremely rich wild plant resources, and the "small autumn harvest" movement was carried out very well, so it achieved such great results. Not every county can achieve this immediately. However, from this prominent example, we can see how fruitful the "small autumn harvest" movement can be for the national economy and the people's livelihood.
    China's vast mountainous areas and grasslands contain extremely rich wild plant resources. According to preliminary investigations, there are already several thousand kinds of wild plant raw materials that can be collected and utilized in large quantities, with a total output of tens of millions of tons. It is truly an inexhaustible treasure house. Most wild plants do not need to be planted or managed; simply collecting them is a great wealth. This spring, many regions carried out a "small spring cultivation" movement to sow and plant wild plants, which is the most favorable condition for achieving an even greater victory in this year's "small autumn harvest." We should fully utilize the rich experiences of last year's "small autumn harvest" and this year's "small summer harvest," strengthen leadership, vigorously launch mass movements, and fully utilize these favorable conditions to collect and harvest wild plants in large quantities.
    Wild plants have many varieties, large yields, and are scattered in growth. The maturity period of the same variety of wild plants is very concentrated. These two major characteristics determine that the "small autumn harvest" movement has great mass participation and a blitzkrieg nature. To mobilize a large number of people and bring back a lot of wild plants in a very short period of time, it is necessary to do a good job in investigation, research, and organization. Leading organs and people's communes at all levels should investigate the varieties, producing areas, yields, and maturity times of local wild plants, rationally arrange labor based on the needs of various agricultural tasks, and make practical and specific plans. Which things need to mobilize large forces for a blitz collection, and which can be collected by professional teams? Which requires experienced or strong labor to collect, and which can be collected by women, the elderly, and the weak? Which are particularly seasonal and most needed by the state to collect first, and which are not seasonal and can be collected using the spare time of commune members? How much labor is used for collection, and how much labor is used for transportation and processing? All of this must be comprehensively planned. Generally speaking, the "small autumn harvest" season is a busy season for agricultural production. Therefore, rationally arranging labor is a key to achieving victory in the "small autumn harvest." The experience of many regions proves that as long as agricultural tasks and labor are arranged well, it is entirely possible to manage and harvest grain and other field crops well while also doing a good job in the "small autumn harvest," achieving a double harvest and not losing either. In last year's "small autumn harvest" movement, Jianhe County, Guizhou, based on the law that large autumn crops and mountain products mature at the same time, started by adjusting agricultural production, harvesting crops that could be harvested early and completing agricultural tasks that could be completed early. When the mountain product maturity season arrived, they concentrated all their efforts to advance into the deep mountains, worked hard for half a month, and successfully completed the mountain product collection task, achieving a double harvest of agriculture and mountain products. When collecting, pay attention to protecting resources and combining collection with cultivation, and never drain the pond to catch all the fish. Regions with conditions should also select some wild plants with high economic value, good quality, and development prospects for artificial cultivation, turning wild plants into domestic plants and establishing large-scale production bases.
    Timely processing and purchasing of wild plants is an important link in achieving a complete victory in the "small autumn harvest" movement. Many fresh wild plants collected in a blitz contain a lot of water and are prone to mildew and deterioration. If they are not processed in time, losses will occur. Many wild plants have a large volume and light weight, and transportation is also inconvenient if they are not processed. Therefore, the various links of collection, processing, purchasing, transportation, and utilization of wild plants must be closely linked, striving to achieve collection, processing, purchasing, transportation, and utilization simultaneously.
    In order to carry out a vigorous "small autumn harvest" movement, it is necessary to carry out solid organizational work. During the peak harvesting season, leading cadres should take the lead in going to high mountains, entering forests, and going to grasslands to personally direct the battle, collecting as many usable wild plants as possible, so that more wild plants can serve socialist construction!

### 大规模开展“小秋收”运动

    大规模开展“小秋收”运动
    满山遍野的野生植物陆续成熟，收获旺季就要来了。我们应该在加强秋田管理的同时，做好充分准备，发动广大群众，合理安排时间，开展一个比去年规模更大的“小秋收”运动，大量采集、加工和利用野生植物。
      “小秋收”是大秋收的重要组成部分。取得“小秋收”的大胜利，对于增加社会财富，保证国民经济的持续跃进，对于增加人民公社和社员的收入，具有重大意义。去年“小秋收”运动的巨大成果就是有力的证明。各地在去年“小秋收”运动的短短时间中采集的野生植物原料，大大超过同年头九个月采集的数量，也大大超过1958年全年采集的数量。这是我国人民向大自然进军的一个重大胜利。“小秋收”运动给国家提供了大量工业原料。各地还利用野生植物制成大量生产资料（各种农具、筐篮、草袋、绳索等）和生活资料（副食品、文化用品和日用杂品等），有力地支援了农业生产和水利建设，满足了市场的需要。“小秋收”运动进一步促进了农村人民公社社办工业的发展，增加了公社和社员的收入。贵州剑河县在去年“小秋收”运动中，全县平均每人增加的收入，比农业生产的收入还要多。当然，剑河县是山区，野生植物资源极为丰富，“小秋收”运动又开展得非常好，所以取得这样巨大的成绩。这不是任何一个县都能马上作到的。但是，从这个突出的例子当中，我们却看到了“小秋收”运动能为国计民生带来多么丰硕的果实。
    我国广大的山区和草原，蕴藏着极为丰富的野生植物资源。据初步调查，已经发现可以大量采集、利用的野生植物原料约有几千种，总产量达几千万吨，实在是一个取之不尽、用之不竭的大宝库。绝大部分野生植物都不用种，也不用管，只用把它采集了来，就是一笔大财富。今年春天，不少地区开展了播种和栽植野生植物的“小春耕”运动，这是今年取得“小秋收”更大胜利的最有利的条件。我们应该充分运用去年“小秋收”和今年“小夏收”的丰富经验，加强领导，大搞群众运动，把这些有利条件充分利用起来，大收特收野生植物。
    野生植物品种多，产量大，生长分散；同一品种的野生植物的成熟期十分集中。这两大特点，决定了“小秋收”运动具有很大的群众性和突击性。要调动庞大的人力，在极短的时间内把很多的野生植物拿回来，必须做好调查研究工作和组织工作。各级领导机关和人民公社，要把本地野生植物的品种、产区、产量和成熟时间调查清楚，根据各项农活的需要，合理安排劳动力，做出切合实际的具体规划。哪些东西需要动员大队人马突击采集，哪些东西可以由专业队采集？哪些需要有经验或强壮劳力去采集、哪些可以用妇女、老弱劳力去采集？哪些是季节性特别强的、国家最需要的先去采集，哪些是季节性不强的可以利用社员工余时间来采集？多少劳力用于采集，多少劳力用于运输、加工？凡此种种，都要加以全面规划。一般地说，“小秋收”季节正是农业生产繁忙的季节，因此，合理地安排劳动力，乃是取得“小秋收”胜利的重要关键。许多地区的经验证明，只要把农活、劳力安排好了，完全可以在管好、收好粮食和别的田间作物的前提下，搞好“小秋收”，作到双丰收，两不丢。贵州剑河县在去年“小秋收”运动中，根据大秋作物和山货同时成熟的规律，从调整农业生产着手，把能提前收获的庄稼提前收获，能提前完成的农活提前完成，到了山货成熟季节，集中全力向深山进军，大干半个月，顺利完成了山货采集任务，取得了农业、山货双丰收。在采集的时候，要注意保护资源，实行采集和培植相结合，千万不能枯本竭源。有条件的地区，还应该选择一些经济价值高、质量好、有发展前途的野生植物，进行人工培植，变野生为家生，建立起大量生产基地。
    及时作好野生植物的加工和收购工作，是取得“小秋收”运动全胜的一个重要环节。突击采集的许多新鲜野生植物，水分很大，容易霉烂变质，如不及时加工处理，就会造成损失。许多野生植物量大体轻，如不进行加工运输也不方便。因此，野生植物的采集、加工、收购、运输各个环节都必须扣紧，力争做到随采集、随加工、随收购、随调运、随利用。
    为了开展轰轰烈烈的“小秋收”运动，必须进行踏踏实实的组织工作。在大量采收季节，领导干部应该带头上高山，入森林，进草原，亲自指挥战斗，把一切可以利用的野生植物尽可能地采集起来，让更多的野生植物为社会主义建设服务！
