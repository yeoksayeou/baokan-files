Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 23rd: Algerian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Belkacem issued a statement here this morning, saying that French officials, during the talks in Melun, had abandoned all possibilities of resolving the Algerian issue through negotiations. The French government should bear full responsibility for its war suppressing the Algerian national independence movement.

Belkacem also said he regretted the continued support of NATO countries for France. It is this support that has enabled France to wage a six-year war.

Belkacem made this statement to reporters before leading the Algerian delegation to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly.

He also said: Faced with French imperialism and its allies, the Algerian people are more determined than ever to continue the liberation struggle until the goal is achieved. The entire Algerian people have mobilized for combat, united firmly and confidently around their government and the National Liberation Front, and are fully prepared to crush all the conspiracies of imperialism. He said that in this struggle, the Algerian people rely first on themselves, and on the support of the people of brotherly and friendly countries, as well as democratic forces around the world. He said: The African people's struggle against imperialism is strengthening Algeria's position, as well as its strength and confidence.

Xinhua News Agency, September 21st: Tunis dispatch: The Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic issued a communique in Tunis on the evening of the 20th, stating that Abbas, Premier of the Provisional Government of Algeria, signed a memorandum on the 19th addressed to the Secretariat of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the member states of this group, condemning the inclusion of Algeria within the region of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization aggression group.

The communique said: "The Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic declares that the promise made by France in the name of Algeria to include Algeria within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization region is invalid."

The communique said that the Provisional Government of Algeria believes that "keeping Algeria within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (scope) constitutes an unsafe factor for the Arab Maghreb." The communique said that the policy of non-alignment is the only effective policy pursued by the Arab Maghreb countries. Maghreb refers to the three North African countries of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 21st: According to a communique issued today by the headquarters of the Algerian National Liberation Army, on September 9th and 10th, the Algerian National Liberation Army killed 212 French soldiers, wounded 160, and captured 155 weapons. In these two days, the National Liberation Army shot down three French aircraft, destroyed 19 military vehicles, and also destroyed a military train with landmines. Six French soldiers surrendered to the Algerian National Liberation Army with all their equipment.

　　贝勒卡塞姆发表声明
　  阿尔及利亚决心斗争到底
    阿尔及利亚民族解放军两天中共毙伤法军三百余人
    新华社开罗23日电　阿尔及利亚临时政府副总理兼外交部长贝勒卡塞姆今天上午在这里发表声明说，法国负责人士在默伦会谈期间已经抛弃了双方通过谈判来解决阿尔及利亚问题的一切可能性。法国政府应对它镇压阿尔及利亚民族独立运动的战争负全部责任。
    贝勒卡塞姆还说，他对北大西洋公约组织国家不断支持法国感到遗憾。正是这种支持，才使法国能够进行历时六年的战争。
    贝勒卡塞姆是在率领阿尔及利亚代表团启程去纽约参加联合国大会之前向记者们发表这项声明的。
    他还说：面对着法帝国主义及其同盟者的阿尔及利亚人民，比以往任何时候更加坚决地要把解放斗争继续下去，直到达到目的为止。全体阿尔及利亚人民已经为了进行战斗而动员起来，坚强而信心百倍地团结在自己的政府和民族解放阵线周围，并且有充分的准备来粉碎帝国主义的一切阴谋。他说，在这场斗争中，阿尔及利亚人民首先依靠自己，依靠兄弟国家和友好国家的人民以及全世界民主力量的支持。他说：非洲人民正在进行的反对帝国主义的斗争，增强了阿尔及利亚的立场，也加强了它的力量和信心。
    新华社21日讯　突尼斯消息：阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府20日晚在突尼斯发表一项公报说，阿尔及利亚临时政府总理阿巴斯19日签署了一份给北大西洋公约侵略集团秘书处和这个集团成员国的备忘录，谴责把阿尔及利亚包括在北大西洋公约侵略集团的地区之内。
    公报说：“阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府宣布，法国以阿尔及利亚名义把阿尔及利亚纳入北大西洋公约地区内所许下的诺言无效。”
    公报说，阿尔及利亚临时政府认为，“把阿尔及利亚保持在北大西洋公约（范围）之内，构成了对阿拉伯马格里布一个不安全的因素。”公报说，不结盟政策是阿拉伯马格里布国家所奉行的唯一有效的政策。马格里布是指北非摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚和突尼斯三个国家。
  据新华社开罗21日电　据阿尔及利亚民族解放军总部今天发表的公报说，9月9日和10日，阿尔及利亚民族解放军打死法军二百十二人，打伤一百六十人，缴获武器一百五十五件。民族解放军在这两天内，击落了三架法国飞机，击毁了十九辆军用车辆，还用地雷炸毁一列军用火车。有六名法国士兵带着全副武装向阿尔及利亚民族解放军投诚。
