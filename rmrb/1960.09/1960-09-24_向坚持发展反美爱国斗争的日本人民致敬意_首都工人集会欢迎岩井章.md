Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: More than 1,500 worker representatives from the capital held a grand meeting at the Workers' Club tonight to warmly welcome Akira Iwai, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), and Secretary Kami Tsuma Akimi, expressing their highest respect to the Japanese workers and people who stand at the forefront of the anti-American struggle.

Li Jiebo, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the meeting. He said that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the workers and people of China and Japan. The workers and people of China and Japan will always support and unite with each other in the common struggle against U.S. imperialism.

Li Jiebo said that the victories achieved by the Japanese people in their anti-American patriotic struggle have made a great contribution to the cause of defending world peace, greatly inspiring the struggle of the people of the world to defend peace and oppose imperialist aggression, and inspiring the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to win and safeguard national independence. The Japanese people have also received the support of peace-loving people all over the world in their struggle, especially the full support of the people of various socialist countries.

Li Jiebo said that recently, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan has decided to launch a powerful unified action demanding the abolition of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, opposition to military bases, opposition to government suppression, and opposition to unemployment, poverty, and demands for improved living standards. Large-scale demonstrations and marches will be held throughout Japan, with the heroic Japanese workers as the core. The Chinese trade unions express their respect for the determination of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan to continue to hold high the banner of anti-Americanism and patriotism, adhere to unity and solidarity, and develop mass struggles, and will continue to fully support the just struggle of the Japanese workers. The Chinese workers and people believe that the Japanese workers and people, who have a universal national awakening and have gained experience in struggle, will be able to inflict heavier blows on U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in a more massive nationwide unified battle action and move towards new victories.

Li Jiebo said that as long as the Japanese workers and people unite and persist in developing the anti-American patriotic united struggle, and promote this struggle to become increasingly high, with the active support of the socialist camp and the workers and people of the world, the Japanese workers and people will surely be able to drive the American aggressors out of Japan. Establish a new Japan of peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality.

Mr. Akira Iwai was invited to speak at the meeting. He said that in the anti-American patriotic struggle carried out by the Japanese workers and people, they have received the support of workers and people all over the world, especially the full support of the Chinese workers and people, which has greatly helped their struggle, for which he expressed his heartfelt thanks.

He said that Japanese workers urgently demand the normalization of Japan-China relations and strive for it as their important mission.

Akira Iwai gave a detailed introduction to the struggle situation of the 22 unified actions and four general strikes carried out by the Japanese workers and people to oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. He severely condemned the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, pointing out that the spearhead of this treaty against foreign aggression is aimed at China and the Soviet Union.

Akira Iwai said that the Japanese workers and people will carry out the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty to the end in the future. Japanese workers must unite with the workers of the world, especially with the workers of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Japanese workers and people will fight for the abolition of American military bases in Japan, demand the withdrawal of American troops from Japan, oppose all conspiracies to revive Japanese militarism, and fight for the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations.

Akira Iwai pointed out that although the struggle of the Japanese people is a long-term one, the struggle will surely achieve final victory. Because, the workers and people all over the world support us. He said that the united strength of the workers and people of China and Japan cannot be stopped by anyone.

The speeches of Li Jiebo and Akira Iwai were warmly welcomed.

Kang Yonghe, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and those in charge of various industrial trade unions attended the meeting. Wang Jiong, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, delivered the opening speech at the beginning of the meeting.

After the meeting, the documentary film "Storm Over Asia" was screened.

    李颉伯说，最近，日本工会总评议会已决定要开展一个要求废除新日美“安全条约”、恢复中日邦交、反对军事基地、反对政府镇压和反对失业、贫困与要求改善生活的强大的统一行动。要以英勇的日本工人为核心，在日本各地举行大规模的示威游行。中国工会对日本总评继续高举反美爱国的旗帜，坚持统一团结，发展群众性的斗争的决心表示敬意，并将继续全力支持日本工人的正义斗争。中国工人和人民相信，已经有普遍的民族觉醒并取得了斗争经验的日本工人和人民，一定能够在更加声势浩大的全国统一的战斗行动中，给美帝国主义及其走狗以更沉重的打击，走向新的胜利。
    李颉伯说，只要日本工人和人民团结一致的坚持发展反美爱国的统一斗争，并促使这一斗争越来越高涨，在社会主义阵营和全世界工人和人民的积极支持下，日本工人和人民一定能够把美国侵略者从日本赶出去。建立一个和平、独立、民主、中立的新日本。

    岩井章说，日本工人和人民今后要把反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争进行到底。日本工人要同全世界的工人团结在一起，特别是同亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的工人团结在一起。日本工人和人民要为废除美国在日本的军事基地，要求美国军队撤出日本，反对一切复活日本军国主义的阴谋，为恢复日中邦交而斗争。
    岩井章指出，尽管日本人民的斗争是长期的，但是斗争一定会取得最后的胜利。因为，全世界的工人和人民都支持我们。他说，中日两国工人和人民的团结力量是任何人也阻挡不住的。
