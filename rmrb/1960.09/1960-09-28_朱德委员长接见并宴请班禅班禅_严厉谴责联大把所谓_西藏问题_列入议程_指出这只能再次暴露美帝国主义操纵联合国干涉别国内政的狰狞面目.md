During the meeting, Panchen Erdeni presented a Hada to Chairman Zhu De, who reciprocated with a Hada and engaged in a cordial conversation with Panchen Erdeni.
Also received at the same time were Panchen Erdeni's father and mother, as well as Lhamin Yixi Chuchen, Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and the Khenpo Ngawang.
Present at the reception were Xi Zhongxun, Vice Premier of the State Council; Huang Yanpei and Li Weihan, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council; Zhang Su, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Wang Feng and Liu Chun, Deputy Directors of the Nationalities Affairs Commission; Zhang Guohua, Deputy Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region; Tan Guansan, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China; and Guo Xilan.
Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: Chairman Zhu De hosted a banquet in the Great Hall of the People this evening to warmly welcome Panchen Erdeni, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, who has come to the capital to attend the celebrations for the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Vice Premiers of the State Council He Long and Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Huang Yanpei and Li Weihan, and Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong attended the banquet this evening.
Chairman Zhu De spoke at the banquet. He first extended a warm welcome to Panchen Erdeni for coming from Tibet to the central government.
Chairman Zhu De said that as the people of all nationalities across the country jointly celebrate the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the situation in our country is very good, and the situation in Tibet is also very good. The democratic reform in Tibet has now been basically completed, the feudal serf system has been destroyed, millions of serfs have been emancipated, land has been distributed, and 100,000 households have joined mutual aid teams. On the basis of this victory, the emancipated people have launched a patriotic production movement and have achieved a great harvest this year. The Party's policy of redemption is being implemented, patriotic upper-class figures have also made progress, and industrial, commercial, cultural, and educational undertakings have all seen great development.
Chairman Zhu De said that it must also be pointed out that our mountaineering team reached the summit of Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, from the north slope of the Himalayas for the first time. The mountaineering team included Tibetan brothers.
Chairman Zhu De said that all of this shows that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the whole country has continued to achieve brilliant victories in all aspects of socialist construction, and the construction of Tibet has also achieved great victories.
Chairman Zhu De finally emphasized that under the excellent situation in the country, the people of all nationalities must unite even more closely under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, hold high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, summon greater revolutionary vigor, carry forward the great revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, and strive to quickly build our country into a strong socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and a modern science and culture.
At the banquet, Panchen Erdeni strongly condemned US imperialism for manipulating the United Nations and including the so-called "Tibetan question" on the agenda of the UN General Assembly. He said that this is a great insult to the people of Tibet, and we express our serious protest against this illegal action.
Panchen Erdeni said that Tibet is forever an inseparable part of our great motherland, and all arrangements and issues concerning Tibet are purely the internal affairs of our country, and no one has the right to interfere. The United Nations General Assembly has no right to discuss the internal affairs of any country. If the United Nations General Assembly illegally discusses the so-called "Tibetan question," the result will only be to expose once again the hideous face of US imperialism manipulating the United Nations to interfere in other countries' internal affairs. Panchen Erdeni resolutely stated that no matter how hard US imperialism and reactionaries try to carry out conspiracies and sabotage activities, they cannot stop Tibet from advancing rapidly on the broad road of democracy and socialism.
In his speech, Panchen Erdeni first paid high tribute to the great leader Chairman Mao. He said that, like the situation in the rest of the country, Tibet is now in a thriving and excellent situation. Under the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we have achieved great victories in suppressing the counter-revolutionary armed rebellion and carrying out democratic reforms. So far, democratic reforms have been basically completed in the agricultural areas with a population of 800,000, and the "three antis and two benefits" movement (the three antis being: anti-rebellion, anti-Ula corvée, anti-personal dependence system; the two benefits being: benefiting both herdsmen and herdowners) has been completed in the pastoral areas with a population of 140,000. The implementation of democratic reform has eliminated the feudal serf system in Tibet, and millions of serfs have been liberated and have become the masters of the new society and the land. The class consciousness of the broad masses of people has been greatly enhanced, and they have boundless love and trust for the Party and Chairman Mao. In areas where democratic reforms have been completed, production mutual aid teams have been generally established, with over 90% of peasant households joining the teams. In terms of agricultural production, this year we have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in Tibetan history due to the conscientious implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture."
Panchen Erdeni said that the facts of the past year have made the people of Tibet more clearly realize that the only way to achieve liberation is to resolutely follow the path pointed out by the Communist Party, conscientiously strengthen unity with the people of all fraternal nationalities in the motherland, work side by side with the people of all fraternal nationalities, support each other, help each other, and jointly prosper and progress, and build a strong and prosperous socialist family of the motherland. Therefore, any divisive conspiracies by imperialism and foreign reactionaries cannot shake the firm will of the Tibetan people to struggle for their complete liberation.
Panchen Erdeni's father and mother, Lhamin Yixi Chuchen, Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, Khenpo Ngawang, and accompanying officials were also invited to attend the banquet.
Also present at the banquet were Zhang Su, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Xie Fumin, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress; Wang Feng, Liu Chun, Sa Kongliao, and Xie Hechou, Deputy Directors of the Nationalities Affairs Commission; Zhang Guohua, Deputy Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region; Tan Guansan and Guo Xilan, Deputy Secretaries of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China; as well as heads of various departments of state organs, the Vice Mayor of Beijing, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

    新华社27日讯　朱德委员长今晚接见了西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼。
    接见时，班禅额尔德尼向朱德委员长献了哈达，朱德委员长回敬了哈达，并且同班禅额尔德尼进行了亲切的谈话。
    同时受到接见的，还有班禅额尔德尼的父亲、母亲和西藏自治区筹备委员会副秘书长拉敏·益喜楚臣、经师恩久活佛等。
    接见时在座的有，国务院副总理习仲勋，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长黄炎培、李维汉，国防委员会副主席张治中，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副秘书长张苏，民族事务委员会副主任汪锋、刘春，西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员张国华、中共西藏工委副书记谭冠三、郭锡兰等。
    新华社27日讯　朱德委员长今晚在人民大会堂举行宴会，热烈欢迎来首都参加建国十一周年庆祝典礼的西藏自治区筹备委员会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼。
    国务院副总理贺龙、习仲勋，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长黄炎培、李维汉，国防委员会副主席张治中出席了今晚的宴会。
    朱德委员长在宴会上讲话。他首先对班禅额尔德尼从西藏地方来到中央，表示热烈的欢迎。
    朱德委员长说，当全国各民族人民共同欢庆建国十一周年的时候，我国的形势是非常好的，西藏的情况也是非常好的。现在，西藏民主改革已经基本完成，封建农奴制度被摧毁了，百万农奴翻了身，分得了土地，并且已经有十万农户参加了互助组。在这个胜利的基础上，翻身人民掀起了爱国丰产运动，并且获得了今年的大丰收。党的赎买政策正在贯彻执行，爱国上层人士也有进步，工业、商业、文化教育事业都有了很大的发展。
    朱德委员长说，还必须指出的是，我国的登山队第一次从喜马拉雅山北坡登上了世界最高峰——珠穆朗玛的顶峰。登山队员中包括藏族的弟兄。
    朱德委员长说，这一切都说明在党中央和毛主席的领导下，全国在建设社会主义的各个方面继续取得了光辉的胜利，西藏地方的建设也取得了巨大的胜利。
    朱德委员长最后强调地说，在全国大好形势下，各民族人民要在党中央和毛主席的领导下，更加团结一致，更高地举起总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗，鼓起更大的革命干劲，发扬艰苦奋斗的伟大革命精神，为尽快地把我国建设成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国而奋斗。
    班禅额尔德尼在宴会上严厉谴责美帝国主义操纵联合国，把所谓“西藏问题”列入了联大的议程。他说，这对我们西藏人民是莫大的侮辱，我们对这种非法行动表示严重抗议。
    班禅额尔德尼说，西藏永远是我们伟大祖国的不可分割的一部分，西藏的一切工作安排问题，纯粹是我国的内政，任何人无权过问，联合国大会根本没有权利讨论任何国家的内政问题。联合国大会如果非法讨论所谓“西藏问题”，其结果只能再一次暴露美帝国主义操纵联合国干涉别国内政的狰狞面目。班禅额尔德尼坚决地说，不管美帝国主义和反动派如何挖空心思进行阴谋破坏活动，但丝毫也不能阻止西藏在民主和社会主义的康庄大道上飞速前进。
    班禅额尔德尼在讲话中首先向伟大的领袖毛主席致崇高的敬意。他说，同全国的形势一样，西藏现在也是欣欣向荣的大好形势。在党中央和毛主席英明正确领导下，已经取得了平息反革命武装叛乱和民主改革的伟大胜利。截至目前为止，在八十万人口的农业区已基本完成了民主改革，并在十四万人口的牧业区完成了“三反两利”（三反即：反叛乱、反乌拉差役、反人身依附制度，两利即：牧工、牧主两利）运动。实行民主改革的结果，消灭了西藏的封建农奴制度，百万农奴得到了解放，成了新社会和土地的主人，广大人民群众的阶级觉悟有了很大提高，对党和毛主席无限爱戴和信任。在已经完成了民主改革的地区，普遍成立了生产互助组，入组农户已达90％以上。在农业生产方面，由于认真贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，今年已经获得了西藏历史上空前未有的大丰收。
    班禅额尔德尼说，一年来的事实，使西藏人民更清楚地认识到，只有坚决跟着共产党所指引的道路，认真加强同祖国各兄弟民族人民的团结，同各兄弟民族人民并肩携手，互相支援，互相帮助，共同繁荣，共同进步，建设富强繁荣的社会主义祖国大家庭，才是自己获得解放的唯一的道路。所以，帝国主义及国外反动派的任何挑拨离间的阴谋诡计，丝毫不能动摇西藏人民为自己的彻底解放而斗争的坚强意志。
    班禅额尔德尼的父亲、母亲，西藏自治区筹备委员会副秘书长拉敏·益喜楚臣，经师恩久活佛和随行官员等也应邀出席了宴会。
    出席宴会的还有，人大常务委员会副秘书长张苏，人大民族委员会副主任委员谢扶民，民族事务委员会副主任汪锋、刘春、萨空了、谢鹤筹，西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员张国华，中共西藏工委副书记谭冠三、郭锡兰，以及国家机关各部门负责人，北京市副市长和首都各界人士等。（附图片）
