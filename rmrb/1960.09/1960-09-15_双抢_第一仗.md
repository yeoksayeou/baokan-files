The First Battle of "Double 抢" by Changsha Worker Zhen Long

	It was just past four o'clock when we set off. Today, our factory is going to the Wannianhong People's Commune to participate in "Double 抢" (抢收抢种, "grab the harvest, grab the planting").

	The bright red factory flag leads the way. In the middle of the procession, a team carries eight loads of chemical fertilizer that were rushed out yesterday. Carrying them to the commune. A set of gongs and drums brings up the rear, banging away noisily.

	Our team of eighteen people was selected from the best of the best in the factory, all with uniformly dark faces and thick arms. The leader is our Youth League branch secretary. We laughed and joked all the way, arriving quickly at Fenglin Ferry. Just after crossing the river, suddenly the sound of gongs and drums also rang out on a road to the left, and some high-pitched voices were singing "The People's Commune is Good!" It turned out to be the workers from the pharmaceutical factory, mostly young girls.

	"Hey, are you also going to 'Double 抢'?" Our old Fang shouted to them.

	"Yes!" several girls scrambled to answer.

	"Which commune?"

	"Wannianhong. What about you?"

	"Ha, exactly the same way!"

	"Great, we've met companions!"

	Two red flags fluttered side by side, two sets of gongs and drums echoed. In the procession, everyone chatted, asking questions. As we talked, we proposed a friendly competition. Our Youth League branch secretary, Lao Fang, and their leader enthusiastically discussed the terms of the collective competition between the two teams. In this way, these two teams that had just met made a verbal agreement and became rivals in the "Double 抢" competition.

	When we arrived at the commune, we were divided into teams to go to various work groups. We were all assigned to the second work group. Group leader Lao Tang took us to our living quarters and told us to make our beds and rest before eating breakfast. Everyone couldn't sit still, so they threw down their backpacks and ran to the canteen for breakfast. The comrades from the pharmaceutical factory arrived even faster than us; they had already started eating. After gulping down a few bowls of rice, we ran to the fields, took off our shoes, and rolled up our trouser legs, ready to go into the field. We saw several girls gathered around their leader, whispering for a while. Then their leader came to our Youth League secretary and said, "Let's start the competition now. We challenge you. The conditions are: to cut quickly, harvest cleanly, and ensure that not a single grain is wasted..." The Youth League secretary readily agreed. He called everyone together and said briefly: "We must not be complacent because we have a full complement of people and strong strength. We must consider that many people are participating in 'Double 抢' for the first time and are not familiar with the technology. If we want to achieve victory, we must work harder."

	Both sides agreed to divide the number of people on each side into two teams, and harvest simultaneously from one end of two adjacent large fields. Two red flags were planted in the center of the field ridge to see which team would seize the red flag first.

	The referee shouted, "The competition begins!" Everyone lined up in the field and bent down, working hard.

	The blazing sun shone in the sky, and our competition became even more intense. All that could be heard was a "chop, chop, chop" sound, and a large area of the field was quickly cleared. No one bothered to wipe away the sweat that flowed to the corners of their eyes, just bent over and cut forward quickly. Occasionally, someone whispered, "Add oil!" "Hurry up, don't fall behind!" "Pay attention to harvesting cleanly and ensuring quality!" The red flag was ahead, and everyone cut even more urgently. At this time, the girls also caught up. Just at this most tense moment, the "dang dang dang dang" sound of finishing work rang out! But no one looked up, no one let go, wanting to cut a few more handfuls in this final time. Lao Tang was shouting at us: "Okay, comrades, finish work and go to eat." Everyone reluctantly stopped their sickles, straightened up, wiped the sweat from their faces, and walked onto the field ridge. We won by cutting five more rows.

	Note: "Double 抢" means grabbing the harvest and grabbing the planting.

    “双抢”第一仗	长沙工人　振龙
    刚打过四点就出发了。今天我们厂到万年红人民公社去参加“双抢”。
    红艳艳的厂旗在前面开路。中间一队挑的是昨天突击出来的八担化肥。挑着送到公社去。一套锣鼓压后，嘭嘭??地敲得好不热闹。
    我们这一队十八个人，是厂里从尖子里拔尖选出来的，都是一崭齐的黑脸膛，粗膀子的小伙子。领头的是我们的团支部书记。一路嘻笑，飞快地来到了枫林渡。刚过了河，忽然在左边的一条路上也响起了锣鼓声，还有一些尖嗓子在合唱着“人民公社好”呢。原来是制药厂的工人，大多数是些年青姑娘。
    “喂，你们也是去‘双抢’的吗？”我们的老方朝他们喊。
    “是啊！”几个姑娘抢着回答。
    “到哪个公社？”
    “万年红。你们呢？”
    “哈，正同一路！”
    “好呀，碰到了同伴哪！”
    两面红旗一排飘着，两套锣鼓响喧天。在队伍里大家就你问我、我问你地谈开了。谈着谈着，大家提出了友谊的竞赛。我们的团支部书记老方和他们的领队热烈地商订起两个队的集体竞赛条件来了。就这样，我们这两支刚遇上的队伍，就互定下口约，成了“双抢”竞赛的对手。
    到了社里，我们就分队到各个作业组去。我们都被分配在第二作业组里。组长老唐带我们到了住的地方，要我们先开铺休息再吃早饭。大家哪里还坐得住，把背包一丢，就跑到食堂里去吃早饭。制药厂的同志们比我们还来得快呢，他们已经开始吃饭了。大家扒了几碗饭，就跑到了田里，把鞋子一脱，卷起裤脚正要下田，只见几个姑娘围着她们的领队叽咕了一阵，她们的领队就来找我们团支书说：“现在我们就开始比赛，我们向你们挑战，条件是：割得快，收得干净，保证不浪费一粒谷子……”。团支书一口答应。把大家喊拢来，简短地说：“我们不要因为人手齐，力气壮自满，要考虑到，好些人是第一次参加‘双抢’，技术不熟悉。要想取得胜利，还必须努一把力。”
    双方约定：把各方人数分成两队，在相邻的两大丘田里各从一头同时向前收割。把两面红旗插在田塍的中央，看哪个队先夺得红旗。
    裁判一声喊：“比赛开始！”大家在田里一字排开，就弯着腰一鼓子劲地干开了。
    火热的太阳在天空照，我们的竞赛也更加火热了。只听得响起一片“嚓嚓嚓”的声音，田里一下子就光了一大片。谁也顾不得去擦掉那流到眼边的汗珠，只是弯着腰飞快地向前割。时而，有人在小声地喊：“加油！”“快赶，莫落后了！”“注意收割干净，保证质量！”红旗就在前面了，大家更加紧张地割开了。这时姑娘们也赶上来了。就在这最紧张的一刻，“当当当当”收工点响了！可是谁也没抬头，谁也没放手，想要在这最后的时间里多割上几把。老唐在喊我们：“好了，同志们收工吃饭去吧。”大家这才不舍地停下镰刀，直起身来，甩掉一脸的汗珠走上田塍。我们以多割五行而取得胜利。
    注：“双抢”，就是抢收抢种。
