    "There's no sesame stalk that can't be cracked!" Lin Xu
    He Wenyi, a young farmer from Dali County, Shaanxi Province, likes to say this: "There's no sesame stalk that can't be cracked!"
    This simple language contains a simple truth: there are no objective things that cannot be understood, no natural laws that cannot be mastered, no scientific knowledge that cannot be learned, no difficulties that cannot be overcome, no...no impossible things! The objective world can be understood and transformed.
    He Wenyi found this truth through practice and also used this truth to guide his practical actions. Just think, a twenty-year-old young farmer, who doesn't even recognize a chemical symbol, wants to manufacture and invent chemical fertilizers and bacterial fertilizers... In the eyes of some people, isn't this wishful thinking and overestimation of one's capabilities? However, He Wenyi has such a stubborn temper. He firmly believes that there is no "sesame stalk that can't be cracked!" Therefore, he used this spirit to overcome difficulties, acquire knowledge, delve into creation, and bravely climb the peak of science. He Wenyi indeed "cracked the sesame stalk," tore open the mysterious veil of science, and within two years, used three large pots to set up a chemical factory that could produce more than one hundred products.
    "There's no sesame stalk that can't be cracked!" How weighty this sentence is! It represents a strong revolutionary belief, reflects an iron revolutionary will, and also demonstrates a persistent revolutionary perseverance. The most valuable thing here is being full of confidence in victory and full of the pioneering spirit of transforming nature. Therefore, in one sentence, such a huge force has been generated in He Wenyi!
    Doing revolution and construction both require confidence; without confidence, nothing can be accomplished. If you want to defeat the enemy, you must believe that the enemy will definitely be defeated; if you want to change the face of "poverty and blankness," you must believe that the newest and most beautiful pictures will definitely appear. Learning science is also like this. A mysterious fortress stands in front of you, and the gate of science is closed. Can you break in? It depends on whether you have the confidence and courage.
    Some people answer: No. Then, you have to squat outside the scientific fortress, sigh at it, look at the gate, the more you look at it, the more mysterious it becomes, the more you think about it, the more confused you become, and your destiny is controlled by those seemingly divine and ghostly things, and the objective world is forever an unknowable "mystery."
    Like He Wenyi, an ambitious person answers: Yes. So, he is radiant and full of strength! Facing the gate of that mysterious palace, he tries every means to attack it endlessly, determined to cross the threshold of science and walk through all the palaces and halls. He must see clearly and learn thoroughly what kind of tricks are there, and whether it is a god or a ghost, they must be under human control.
    Marxists, starting from the dialectical materialist understanding, believe that there is no "sesame stalk that can't be cracked," and believe that the laws of development of objective things can be understood and mastered. Therefore, we establish the great ambition to transform the world, muster soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, and give full play to subjective initiative to realize the great ideals of the revolution. The idea that the palace of science is mysterious and incomprehensible is just a kind of ideological reflection of "agnosticism," and it has nothing in common with Marxism.
    Chairman Mao said in "On practice": "If you want knowledge, you must participate in the practice of changing reality. To know the taste of a pear, you must change the pear and eat it yourself." Knowledge comes from practice. Through practice, you can go from ignorance to knowledge, and from knowing little to knowing more. This does not underestimate the importance of book knowledge at all. The problem is that book knowledge must be closely integrated with practice. He Wenyi's valuable point is that he attaches importance to book knowledge, but does not blindly believe in book knowledge, but instead uses his own practice to test and apply it.
    Some people say that to master science, it is impossible without conditions. True, conditions are important. We have always believed that to do a good job, there must be necessary conditions. However, conditions are not dead things, and conditions can be created and changed by people. Marxism requires people to be masters of objective conditions, not slaves of objective conditions. Since you want to be the master, you must actively create conditions and improve conditions. How can you be tied down by big and small conditions!

### “哪有破不开的芝麻秆！”

    “哪有破不开的芝麻秆！”	林旭
    陕西大荔县青年农民何文义爱说这么一句话：“哪有破不开的芝麻秆！”
    这句平易的语言里，包含着一个朴素的真理，那就是：哪有不可以认识的客观事物，哪有不可以掌握的自然规律，哪有不可以学到的科学知识，哪有不可以克服的种种困难，哪有……哪有办不到的事情！客观世界是可以认识的，也是可以改造的。
    何文义从实践中找到了这条真理，同时也用这条真理去指导自己的实际行动。你想想看，一个二十岁的青年农民，连个化学符号都不认识，却要制造和发明化学肥料、细菌肥料……。这在有些人看来，岂不是心高妄想，不自量力吗？可是，何文义就有那么一股子硬脾气，他坚决相信没有“破不开的芝麻秆！”于是，用这种精神去打倒困难，夺取知识，钻研创造，勇敢地攀登科学高峰。何文义果然“破开了芝麻秆”，撕开了科学神秘的帷幕，在两年的时间内，用三口大锅办起了一座能生产一百多种产品的化工厂。
      “哪有破不开的芝麻秆！”这句话多么有分量！它代表了坚强的革命信念，反映了钢铁的革命意志，也表现了坚韧不拔的革命毅力。这里最值得宝贵的就是充满必胜的信心，充满改造自然的首创精神。所以，一句话，在何文义的身上产生了如此巨大的力量！
    干革命，搞建设，都需要有信心；没有信心，什么事情也办不成功。你要想打倒敌人，你就要相信敌人一定会被打倒；你要改变“一穷二白”的面貌，你就要相信最新最美的画图一定会出现。学习科学也是这样。一座神秘的堡垒耸立在面前，科学的大门封闭着，能不能打进去？就要看你有没有信心和勇气。
    有人答曰：不能。那么，只好蹲在科学堡垒的门外，对着它叹气，眼望着那扇大门，越看越神秘，越想越糊涂，自己的命运被那些似神似鬼的东西支配着，客观世界永远是个不可知的“谜”。
    像何文义这样的志士答曰：能。于是，精神焕发，全身都是力量！对着那扇神秘宫殿的大门，想方设法，攻之不休，定要跨进科学的门槛，走遍三宫六殿。那里究竟有些什么名堂，一定要看个明白，学个彻底，是神是鬼，都要听人的支配。
    马克思主义者从辩证唯物主义的认识出发，相信没有“破不开的芝麻秆”，相信客观事物的发展规律是能够认识和掌握的。因此，我们树立改造世界的雄心大志，鼓足冲天的革命干劲，充分发挥主观能动作用去实现革命的远大理想。那种认为科学之宫，神秘莫测，无法理解，不过是“不可知论”的一种思想反映，它和马克思主义毫无共同之点。
    毛主席在《实践论》中说过这么一段话：“你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃。”知识是从实践中得来的。通过实践可以从无知到有知，从知得少到知得多。这里一点也没有低估书本知识的重要意义。问题在于书本知识要和实践紧密地结合在一起。何文义的可贵之处就是：重视书本知识，但不迷信书本知识，而是把书本知识通过自己的实践来检验和运用。
    有人说，要掌握科学，没有条件办不到。不错，条件是重要的，我们从来就认为，要办好一件事，总要有必要的条件。但是，条件也不是死东西，条件可以由人们创造和改变。马克思主义要求人们要作客观条件的主人，不要作客观条件的奴隶。既要当主人，就要积极主动地创造条件，改善条件，岂能被大大小小的条件束缚住手脚！
