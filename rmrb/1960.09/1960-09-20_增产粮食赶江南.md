Increase Grain Production to Catch Up with the South
　　Our reporter Jiang Weicai

    In early September, the early autumn sun was still a bit scorching. I came to Xiaonan Public Commune in Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province. Stepping on the land of the commune, one immediately gets a refreshing impression. In the fields, patches of medium rice about to ripen exude an inviting fragrance; large swathes of dark, oily late japonica rice grow lush and even, shimmering with green ripples in the autumn sun; by the river, tens of thousands of dan of river mud have been turned up from the riverbed; and thousands upon thousands of grass ponds, like pools of fermenting black dough, are brimming full. This is a key commune in Yancheng County striving to catch up with the South. Since the Party issued the call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, the commune members have been working even harder, raising the targets for catching up with the South even higher and formulating more solid measures.

    “Dragging Leg” Seedlings Transformed into “Red Flag” Seedlings

    Every cadre and commune member, in every corner of Xiaonan Public Commune, focuses on eliminating third-class seedlings as a key target. They know that promoting balanced growth over a large area of autumn-ripening crops is a crucial key to significantly increasing grain production.

    In late August, the Third Production Team of the Limin Production Brigade had a patch of eighty-seven mu of late japonica rice in a place called Wanjiaogou. Because this area had "black peach soil," the rice paddies were always hardened. Although the rice seedlings were growing better than in previous years, compared to the surrounding rice fields, it was still a patch of third-class seedlings. Production Team Leader Qian Huailin was very worried about this. He thought: The Party is calling on us to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, and we still have such disappointing third-class seedlings here! He calculated that if he could completely eliminate this "dragging leg" seedling patch, he could harvest several more percent of grain per mu, and these eighty-seven mu of land could yield more than ten thousand extra jin of grain. That's no small number! He immediately consulted with the commune members. Commune member Zheng Dengshan said, "If we put in a few more layers of fine effort, learn the methods of the South, and loosen the roots, perhaps we can prevent the soil from hardening." This suggestion reminded everyone, and they all contributed ideas focusing on the word "fine." Finally, it was decided to apply fertilizer once, then weed and hoe, and then loosen the roots once, performing several processes in one go.

    As soon as the discussion ended, Qian Huailin organized a shock team, set up a work shed in the field, and rested and ate there. They applied fertilizer and weeded and hoeed at the fastest speed. At the same time, they sent people to Zhangzhuang Brigade to invite Zhu Atu and Chen Gengen, veteran farmers from Kunshan in the South, to guide them in the technique of loosening the roots. Soon everyone learned it. They skillfully knelt in the rice rows with two strong legs, moving forward flexibly while loosening the soil around the roots with their fingers. However, the soil was very hardened, and work efficiency was low. Everyone thought of another way. Qian Huailin suddenly remembered: The newly composted grass pond mud foams up with black bubbles after two days. If they also stuffed a handful of green grass next to the rice plants, and bubbles appeared in the rice paddies, wouldn't the soil become more soluble? Sure enough, after this method was implemented, the "black peach soil" that had been hardened for many years became soft and mushy. After more than half a month of fine processing and management, all the "dragging leg" seedlings changed completely, and more than fifty mu were even planted with red flags.

    Ensuring Increased Production Grain by Grain

    On the night of September 4th, a gale howled and heavy rain poured down. A seventy-eight mu high-yield plot of medium japonica rice in Zhangzhuang Brigade, despite taking a series of measures to prevent lodging, still couldn't withstand the attack of the wind. The stout stalks of rice were blown down by the wind, and the dense ears of rice lay in the rainwater.

    Peng Xuewu, Deputy Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, walked around the field and immediately found Xu Jiafu, Deputy Secretary of the Brigade Branch, and veteran farmers Liu Guangfa, Zhang Haida, etc., to study rescue measures. Secretary Peng said firmly, "We must do everything possible to rescue these lodged rice plants." The cadres and commune members present all echoed, "Right! Gales can't blow down our determination to increase production, and rainstorms can't wash away our will to catch up with the South. We will definitely find a way to overcome it." So, one by one, methods for rescuing the lodged rice were brought to the table. Based on past experience, everyone believed that the lodged rice stalks must be straightened up immediately to ensure grain-by-grain increase in production.

    The battle to seize grain began. The commune members of the Second Production Team formed combat groups for materials, drainage, and rice seedling arrangement, and deployed the battle formation for seizing grain. The members of the materials group quickly collected ten thousand sorghum stalks and wrapped more than seven hundred straw belts. The neighboring First Production Team also immediately dispatched sixteen commune members to join the battle. The Third Production Team, living in the west end, also immediately selected fifty shrewd and strong commune members to rush to the scene. Suddenly, the three armies converged, and Party Committee Deputy Secretary Peng Xuewu and Brigade General Branch Deputy Secretary Xu Jiafu also fought side by side with the commune members. Barefoot, braving the showers of rain, they propped up the rice plants lying in the rainwater, one by one, handful by handful, against the supports. After a day of hard work, the eighteen mu of lodged rice in the high-yield plot were all propped up, maintaining normal ventilation and light transmission conditions. A few days later, every ear of rice on every plant grew plump and full, without any loss.

    Difficult to Determine the Winner in the Competition Across the River

    In Xiaonan Public Commune, people have launched a wave of overproduction competition everywhere to produce more grain. They are competing both this year, striving to harvest more grain in the fall, and next year, striving to plant good winter wheat and get more summer grain next year. Now, a lively scene of chasing and catching up with each other has emerged everywhere.

    One day, at a meeting of commune members in Zhangzhuang Brigade, the members of the Second Production Team proposed an initiative to the members of the First Production Team to compete in accumulating sufficient base fertilizer for autumn planting. The members of the First Team immediately accepted the challenge. Let's see which one will win?

    In the first few days of the competition, the members of the Second Team moved quickly, dredging river mud, cutting green grass, shoveling sod, and picking leaves, finding fertilizer sources from all directions and making fertilizer. They quickly built eighty-three grass mud ponds, each more than half full, and also accumulated ninety-one compost piles, leading the First Team. Xu Zhian, Deputy Secretary of the First Team Branch, led cadres and commune members to visit the Second Team. As soon as they returned home, they immediately convened a meeting of commune members that evening to find the reasons and think of solutions. One commune member said: Our team's manpower is about the same as the Second Team, but we have fewer fertilizer accumulation tools. Seeing that the "black ingots" in the river can't be brought ashore. Everyone calculated that relying only on the three small boats in the team to dredge river mud, not to mention catching up with the Second Team, they wouldn't even be able to complete the task of autumn sowing base fertilizer by the time the wheat turns green. This won't do! After such a discussion and calculation, everyone found many ways to solve the problem of tools.

    The next day, the First Production Team extracted hundreds of laborers, and according to the strength of the labor force, formed combat groups for accumulating river mud, cutting green grass, shoveling sod, and picking leaves. Xu Zhian and Deputy Captain Yi Zhaofeng led dozens of strong laborers, jumped into the river, and shoveled the river mud up, one shovel at a time. A row of people in the river, a row of people on the river bank, and a row of people on the river shore. In an instant, black river mud was received from the bottom of the river to the river bank, and from the river bank to the shore, and sent into the grass mud ponds. At this time, the "Top Ten Sisters" group, which was cutting green grass on the river bank, decided to compete with the young men. They quickly completed the task of cutting green grass and also participated in the battle of scooping up river mud. On this day, in addition to filling the original twenty-five half-full ponds, the entire production team also built one hundred and twenty new grass mud ponds, all covered to the brim.

    How could the Second Production Team, which had been leading in fertilizer accumulation, willingly fall behind? They earnestly studied the First Team's fertilizer accumulation experience, re-adjusted the labor force, and further improved the fertilizer accumulation tools. The next day, they re-filled all one hundred and forty half-full grass mud ponds. At present, the cadres and commune members of these two teams, in order to strive for an even greater wheat harvest next year, are still fighting across the river, chasing and catching up with each other, and it is difficult to determine the winner.

    增产粮食赶江南	本报记者　姜韦才
    9月初，初秋的阳光还有些炙人，记者来到了江苏省盐城县小江南公社。踏上公社的土地，就给人满目舒畅的印象，田野里，一块块将要黄熟的中稻，散发出诱人的清香；大片大片乌油油的晚粳稻，长得簇崭齐，在秋阳下闪着绿色的波纹；河边上，千万担的河泥从河底下翻了上来；成千上万个草塘，像一池池发酵的黑面，涨得满满的。这里是盐城县赶江南的重点公社。党的大办农业、大办粮食的号召发出以后，这里的社员更是劲上加劲，把赶江南的指标提得更高，措施订得更扎实了。
    “拖腿”苗变成“红旗”苗
    小江南公社每一个干部、社员，每一个角落，都把消灭三类苗作为重点进攻的目标。他们知道，促使秋熟作物大面积生长平衡，是大幅度增产粮食的重要关键。
    那是8月下旬，利民生产大队第三生产队，在一个名叫湾角沟的地方，有一块八十七亩晚粳稻，这地方因为是“黑桃土”，稻田里老是板结，稻苗的长势虽比往年好些，但比起周围的稻田，还是一块三类苗。生产队长钱怀林为这件事大伤脑筋，他想：党号召我们大办农业、大办粮食，我们这里还有这样不争气的三类苗，这还行！他拨拨指头一算，要是把这块“拖腿”苗全部消灭掉，那每亩就可以多收几成粮，这八十七亩田就可多收上万斤粮食，数字可不小啊。他立即找社员一起商量。社员郑登山说：“我们再加上几成细功夫，学江南的办法，揣揣秧根，也许能使板土不板。”这个建议提醒了大家，一个个都在“细”字上头献策献计。最后，决定先上一次肥，再耘耥，再揣一次秧根，几道工序一次上。
    座谈会一结束，钱怀林就组织了一个突击队，在田头搭起工棚，休息、吃饭都在田头。他们一面以最快的速度进行追肥、耘耥；一面又派人到张庄大队请了江南的昆山老农朱阿土、陈根南来指导揣秧根的技术，很快大家就学会了。他们熟练地用两条有劲的腿跪在稻行里，一边灵活地向前移行，一边用手指把秧根四周扒松。但是，泥土板结得很，工作效率不高。大家又想办法，选了些和手指头一般粗的竹竿，把它削尖，做成寸把长的假指头，套在手指上，干起活来又轻便又快。
    经过追肥、耘耥、揣秧根，稻苗的长势逐渐转好，但是有些稻田还是板结。钱怀林又动了脑筋，猛然他想起：最近新沤的草塘泥，两天以后就泛起黑泡，如果在稻棵旁边也塞上一把青草，稻田里都泛起泡来，土质不就更溶了吗？果然，这个办法实行后，多年板结的“黑桃土”都变的溶糊糊的了，经过半个多月的精细加工管理，“拖腿”苗全部变了样，其中有五十多亩还插上了红旗。
      穗穗粒粒保增产
    9月4日夜里，狂风呼啸，暴雨如注。张庄大队有一块七十八亩高产片的中粳稻，尽管采取了一系列防倒伏的措施，仍然抵抗不住大风的袭击，秆子粗壮的稻子被大风刮倒了，密密的稻穗躺在雨水里。
    公社党委副书记彭学五在田里走了一转，立即找了大队支部副书记徐家富和老农刘广发、张海大等研究抢救办法。彭书记坚定有力地说：“我们一定要千方百计把这些倒伏的稻子抢救起来。”在座的干部和社员都一个劲地说：“对！狂风吹不倒我们增产的决心，暴雨冲不掉我们赶江南的意志，我们一定有办法战胜它。”于是一个个抢救倒伏稻子的办法提到了桌案上。根据往年经验，大家认为，要马上把倒伏的稻秆扶直起来，才能保证粒粒增产。
    夺粮的战斗开始了。第二生产队的社员们组成了材料、排水、整理稻苗等战斗小组，摆开了夺粮战斗的阵势。材料组的社员很快筹集了万把根高粱秆子，绕好七百多根草腰子。邻近的第一生产队，也马上出动十六个社员赶来参加战斗。住在西头的第三生产队，也立即挑了五十多个精明强悍的社员奔到现场。顿时，三路大军会师，党委副书记彭学五和大队总支副书记徐家富，也和社员们一起并肩作战。他们赤着脚，冒着阵阵细雨，把倒伏在雨水里的稻子，一棵棵一把把地扶靠在架子上。经过一天奋战，高产片的十八亩倒伏稻子全被扶了起来，保持了正常的通风透光条件。几天之后，每一棵稻上的穗粒都长得饱鼓鼓的，一点也没受损失。	  隔河比赛胜负难分
    在小江南公社，人们为了增产更多的粮食，到处掀起了超产竞赛的热潮，他们既赛今年，争取秋季多收粮；又赛明年，争取多种种好冬麦，明年拿到更多的夏粮。现在，到处出现了你追我赶的生动场面。
    一天，在张庄大队的社员会议上，第二生产队的社员向第一生产队的社员提出了积足秋种基肥的竞赛倡议，一队的社员立即应战，看看吧，究竟是那一个个人取胜？
    竞赛的头几天，二队的社员动手快，罱河泥、割青草、铲草皮、摘树叶，从四面八方找肥源，搞肥料，一下就搞起八十三个草泥塘，塘塘都有大半满，还积了九十一个堆肥，比一队领先。一队支部副书记徐志安带领了干部和社员到二队参观，一回到家，连晚召开了社员会议，找原因，想办法。有个社员说：我们队里的人马和一队差不多，就是积肥工具少，眼看河里的“黑元宝”上不了岸。大家一算账，光靠队里现有三条小船罱河泥，别说赶不上二队，就是到了麦子发青也完不成秋播基肥的任务，这不行啊！这样一讨论、一算账，大家找出了很多解决工具的办法。
    次日，第一生产队抽出百把个劳力，根据劳力强弱，分别组成了积河泥、割青草、铲草皮、摘树叶等战斗小组。徐志安和副队长裔兆凤带领几十个身强力壮的社员，跳到河里，一锹一锹地把河泥捞上来。河里一排人，河坎上一排人，河岸上一排人。顿时间，乌黑的河泥从河底里接到河坎，又从河坎接到岸上，送进了草泥塘。这时，在河岸上割青草的“十大姐”小组，决定和小伙子们赛一赛。她们赶紧完成了割青草的任务，也参加了涝河泥的战斗。这一天，全生产队除将原来二十五个半满的塘装满，又新搞起一百二十个草泥塘，塘塘都盖满。
    原来积肥领先的第二生产队怎么甘心落后呢？他们认真学习了一队的积肥经验，重新调整了劳力，进一步改进了积肥工具，第二天就把一百四十个半满的草泥塘全部复满。眼前，这两个队的干部和社员，为了争取明年麦子更大的丰收，还在隔河相战，你追我赶，胜负难分。
