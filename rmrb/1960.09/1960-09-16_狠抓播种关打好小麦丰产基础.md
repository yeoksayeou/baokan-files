Firmly Grasp the Sowing Stage to Lay a Good Foundation for Wheat Bumper Harvest
China Academy of Agricultural Sciences Institute of Crop Cultivation and Physiology

"Good wheat depends on good sowing" is a summary of the long-term practical experience of our laboring farmers. This is because wheat, unlike crops such as cotton and corn, does not require thinning, setting seedlings, or inter-tillage after sowing. It is also different from crops such as rice and tobacco, which require raising seedlings and transplanting. Sowing (including sowing density, sowing method, sowing time, and sowing quality, etc.) directly determines the plant density and distribution throughout the entire growth period of wheat, affecting the number of ears and grains at the end. The saying "Good sowing is 60% of the harvest" fully illustrates the importance of doing a good job in wheat sowing.

What are the common experiences for sowing good wheat?

        First, Deep plowing and fine harrowing, apply sufficient base fertilizer.

Soil is the base for providing wheat with nutrients and moisture, and for rooting and growing. Therefore, the primary condition for sowing good wheat is to prepare the land well. Wheat is a fibrous root crop with fine roots and many branches, so it has relatively strict requirements for soil conditions. At the same time, wheat is generally sown in rows. If the ground is uneven or has many clods, the sowing depth will be inconsistent, and the emergence of seedlings will be uneven. Therefore, arranging land preparation work is of particular importance for striving for a bumper wheat harvest next year. Land preparation must be carried out in the suitable plowing season. The so-called suitable plowing season refers to the best soil moisture condition for plowing and harrowing effect, that is, the soil moisture is between 16% and 20%, or the soil water holding rate is between 60% and 70% (as generally referred to by the masses, it is good when the soil can be pinched into a lump by hand, but crumbles when it falls to the ground). If the soil is too dry or too wet, it will not only increase the difficulty of cultivation and waste labor, but also the quality of cultivation will be poor. Therefore, in areas where soil moisture is insufficient but there are irrigation conditions, it is necessary to irrigate the bottom soil moisture to improve the quality of land preparation and ensure complete seedling emergence.

In terms of wheat fertilization, various places have the experience of "fertilizing before the year is better than fertilizing during the year, and fertilizing during the year is better than applying base fertilizer," and attach great importance to the application of base fertilizer. Generally, the farmyard manure used is mostly slow-acting organic fertilizer. Applying it early as base fertilizer can not only continuously supply nutrients throughout the entire growth period of wheat, but also have a good effect on controlling the excessive growth of wheat plants in the early stage and preventing premature aging in the later stage; at the same time, applying sufficient base fertilizer can also improve the soil structure, increase the soil's water and fertilizer retention capacity, and promote the reproduction and activity of soil microorganisms, thereby continuously improving soil fertility. From the investigation data of various places, the effect of increasing base fertilizer is very significant. For example, in the experiment conducted by the Chengba Brigade of Chengba Commune in Meng County, Henan Province, applying 10,000 jin of sludge base fertilizer per mu increased 22,000 ears per mu and 7.1 grains per ear compared to applying 7,000 jin under the same conditions. Another example is the investigation by the Crop Research Institute of the Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Applying 15,000 jin of pig manure per mu, with 54% as base fertilizer, yielded 899 jin per mu; with 33% as base fertilizer, yielded 672 jin per mu; and with all as top dressing, yielded only 541 jin per mu, with a very large difference in yield. In order to meet the needs of seedling growth, applying fast-acting chemical fertilizer as "seed fertilizer" is an economical and effective fertilization method. Especially for general late-sown or less fertile wheat fields, applying "seed fertilizer" can promote seedling tillering and rooting, and also benefit ear differentiation and improve ear setting rate, with a very obvious yield increase effect. "Seed fertilizer" is applied with sowing, or applied near the seed ditch during shallow plowing before sowing. The amount should not be too much, otherwise it will easily cause seedling burn.

      Second, Give Full Play to the Yield-Increasing Benefits of Improved Varieties.

With the improvement of fertilizer and water conditions, the yield-increasing effect of improved varieties is becoming more and more obvious, especially in resisting disasters such as rust, wheat midges, and frost, improved varieties play a prominent and important role. In recent years, due to vigorous promotion, improved varieties have basically become popularized. However, after the planting of a single variety, agricultural work becomes too concentrated, increasing the difficulty in arranging labor and machinery; and planting a single variety is also prone to losses from unexpected disasters. In response to this situation, it is necessary to expand the planting of existing improved varieties, and also give full play to the role of local improved varieties; at the same time, vigorously promote disease-resistant varieties, implement multi-variety combinations, and reduce the cultivated area of disease-susceptible varieties.

Another important issue in seed work is the issue of seed mixing. Mixed varieties not only grow unevenly, but also mature inconsistently, making it difficult to give full play to the yield-increasing potential of improved varieties. The main reason for the mixing of varieties is insufficient attention to seed retention; at the same time, due to insufficient seed quantity, it is necessary to temporarily call in mixed wheat from grain depots. This year, the wheat field area in various places has expanded, so we must start preparing seeds as soon as possible to ensure the quality of the seeds.	  Third, Improve Sowing Quality and Ensure Full and Strong Seedlings.

The central issue of sowing well is to ensure "full and strong seedlings." The so-called full seedlings means that there are enough seedlings and even distribution in a piece of land, forming a population that can maximize the use of light energy and nutritional conditions to obtain more ears, larger ears, and a bumper harvest. Regarding planting density, according to statistics from the Institute of Crop Cultivation and Physiology of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the average yield is highest with 250,000 to 300,000 basic seedlings based on density planting experiments conducted in provinces and cities such as Beijing, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, and Yunnan. From a regional perspective, 200,000 to 300,000 seedlings are suitable in the south, and 250,000 to 350,000 seedlings are suitable in the north. At the same time, there are differences due to the early or late sowing time, soil fertility, and varietal characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to master the dynamic and reasonable structure of the population at each growth stage of seedling, plant, ear, and grain on the basis of a certain basic number of seedlings in order to finally achieve a yield increase through dense planting. Basic seedlings refer to the actual number of seedlings that emerge. How many seeds to sow still depends on the size of the seeds, the level of germination rate, and the strength of germination potential. Under the current general field production conditions, even if the seed germination rate is not too bad, the general seedling emergence rate is around 70%, and one jin of seeds yields about 10,000 seedlings. In clay soil areas in the south, as well as arid areas in the north, or plots with poor land preparation quality, the seedling emergence rate is only 40% to 50%. Therefore, the sowing amount must be determined based on the actual possible number of seedlings that emerge.

In addition to mastering the sowing amount, the sowing method is closely related to ensuring reasonable plant distribution and balanced growth. According to the experience of various places, the northern region adopts narrow-row machine sowing with 4.5-inch to 5-inch rows, and the southern region adopts horizontal ridge wide-row sowing with 4-inch to 5-inch sowing width and 5-inch to 6-inch row spacing. The plants are evenly distributed and can fully utilize light energy and nutritional space, which is a relatively suitable sowing method at present. What is worth introducing here is the wide-row sowing method of "sparse inside and dense outside" created by the Paidong Commune in Liu'an County, Anhui Province. A roller seeder is used with a seeding width of 5 inches. The two sides each have 2 inches of hole rows, and the middle one inch has no holes. This ensures that the seed distribution within the seeding width is "sparse inside and dense outside," thereby overcoming the shortcomings of poor light transmission and poor growth of plants within the width. In addition, in intercropping areas, methods such as "two dense and one sparse" (two narrow rows and one wide row) and "small three rows" (three narrow rows and one wide row) are used, which are beneficial for early light transmission and subsequent intercropping of summer crops. Selecting seeds plays an important role in improving sowing quality. Large seeds have more nutrients, which can enhance germination potential and uniformity, and the wheat is also stronger in the early stage of growth. Therefore, selecting seeds by wind selection, screening, or water selection is an economical and effective yield-increasing measure.

Timely sowing not only makes full use of natural conditions to promote wheat seedlings to have enough strong tillers and well-developed roots before winter, but also can avoid or reduce frost damage, rust, and dry winds by adjusting the sowing period, which is very important for stable and high yield. Sowing too early is prone to excessive growth and bolting, leading to frost damage; sowing too late results in fewer tillers before the year, weak seedling growth, often leading to fewer ears, smaller ears, and delayed maturity, resulting in reduced production. The so-called suitable sowing period should reflect the sowing period with the highest yield. Therefore, the suitable sowing period varies depending on different varieties or different plots of land. For example, spring varieties or fertile plots should be sown later, while winter varieties or less fertile plots should be sown earlier, but this is still the suitable sowing period for that variety or plot. Determining the sowing period mainly lies in mastering the temperature conditions before winter to meet the heat energy required for wheat seedlings to achieve "strong but not vigorous" growth. A certain number of tillers is one of the important signs of strong seedlings. From the materials of high-yield fields in various places, it is more appropriate for single-plant tillers to reach three to five (900,000 to 1.1 million tillers per mu) in the northern wheat region before winter, three to four (800,000 to 1 million tillers per mu) in the central wheat region, and two to three (700,000 to 900,000 tillers per mu) in the southern wheat region. Wheat generally stops tillering at 3 to 5 degrees Celsius. According to statistics from the Agricultural Meteorology Research Office of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences from 1953 to 1959, it takes about 350 to 400 degree-days above 3 degrees Celsius from sowing to the growth of four tillers. The research results of the Jiangsu Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Nanjing show that it takes about 400 degree-days above 3 degrees Celsius from sowing to the growth of three tillers, which is equivalent to more than 40 days of growth before winter. According to the average of nine years of data from the Jinnan Agricultural Science Research Institute, the most suitable sowing period temperature index is 380 to 450 degree-days above 2 degrees Celsius of soil temperature at 5 centimeters, which is equivalent to 50 days of growth before winter in general years and 60 days of growth in warm autumn years. In addition to temperature, factors affecting tillering before winter include moisture, light, and nutritional conditions. For example, if the sowing period is slightly delayed, appropriate watering and fertilization can also promote seedling tillering and growth; however, temperature conditions are still the dominant factor. According to the experience of the masses in various places and the results of sowing period experiments, the general suitable sowing period is mid-to-late September in the northern wheat region, early-to-mid October in the central wheat region, mid-to-late October in the Yangtze River basin wheat region, and mid-to-late November in the South China wheat region.

Due to the differences in region, stubble, and land conditions, the focus of sowing good wheat also varies. In addition to the above common technical measures, there are also special problems for a specific region or a wheat field, which requires carefully summarizing local experience and analyzing the specific situation of each wheat field to formulate corresponding technical measures.

    狠抓播种关打好小麦丰产基础	中国农业科学院栽培生理研究所
    “麦好在种”，是我国劳动农民长期实践经验的总结。因为小麦既不同于棉花、玉米等作物需要播种后进行间苗、定苗、中耕，也不同于水稻、烟草等作物需要育秧、移栽。播种（包括播种密度、播种方式、播种时期、以及播种质量等）直接决定了小麦整个生育期的植株密度和分布情况，影响到最后成穗与籽粒的多少。“种好六成收”这句农谚，充分说明做好小麦播种工作的重要性。
    种好小麦的共同经验是哪些呢？
        第一、深耕细耙、施足底肥
    土壤是供给小麦养分、水分，赖以扎根生长的基地。因此，种好小麦的首要条件，就是把地整好。小麦属于须根作物，根系纤细、分枝多，对土壤条件要求比较严格；同时，小麦一般采取条播，如果地整的不平或者坷垃多，播种就会深浅不一，出苗不齐。因此，安排好整地工作，对争取明年小麦大丰收有着特别重要的作用。整地要抓紧适耕时机进行，所谓适耕时机，是指耕耙效果最好的土壤墒情，也就是土壤水分在16％到20％之间，或土壤持水率在60％到70％之间（像一般群众所说的土壤可用手掐成团块，但一落到地上就散碎的情况为好）。土壤过干、过湿，不仅增加耕作的困难，耗费劳力，耕作的质量也差。因此，在土壤水分不足而有灌溉条件的地方，需要进行灌底墒水，以提高整地质量，保证出苗齐全。
    在小麦施肥方面，各地都有“年外不如年里，年里不如掩底”，十分重视施用底肥的经验。一般所用的农家肥料，多系迟效性的有机质肥料，提早作底肥施用，不仅可以在小麦整个生育期间源源不断地供应养分，对控制麦株前期徒长和防止后期早衰有良好作用；同时，施足底肥还能够改良土壤结构，增加土壤保水、保肥能力，促进土壤微生物的繁殖和活动，从而不断提高土壤肥力。从各地调查资料来看，增施底肥的效果十分显著。如河南孟县城伯公社城伯大队试验，每亩施污土底肥一万斤比施七千斤的，在同样条件下，每亩增加二万二千穗，每穗增加七点一粒。又如河南省农业科学院作物所调查，每亩同样施猪圈粪一万五千斤，以54％作底肥的，亩产八百九十九斤；以33％作底肥的，亩产六百七十二斤；全部作追肥施用的，亩产仅五百四十一斤，产量相差十分悬殊。为了满足苗期生长的需要，用速效化肥作为“种肥”施用，是一种经济有效的施肥方法，特别是一般晚茬或地力较瘠薄的麦田，施用“种肥”能够促进幼苗分蘖、生根，也有利于幼穗分化和提高成穗率，增产效果十分明显。“种肥”，随播种施下，或播前浅耕时施于种子沟附近，数量不宜过多，过多则易发生烧苗现象。
      第二、充分发挥良种增产效益
    随着肥水条件的提高，良种的增产作用越来越明显，特别针对抵抗锈病、吸浆虫、霜冻等灾害上，良种有着突出重要的作用。几年来由于大力推广，良种基本达到普及。但是，种植品种单一化以后，农活过于集中，增加了劳力和机具等安排上的困难；并且种植一个品种，也容易遭受意外灾害的损失。针对这种情况，必须扩大种植现有的良种，还要充分发挥地方良种的作用；同时要大力推广抗病品种，实行多品种组合，压缩感病品种的栽培面积。
    在种子工作上另一个重要的问题是种子混杂的问题。品种混杂不仅生长不整齐，成熟也不一致，难以发挥良种的增产潜力。造成品种混杂的主要原因是对留种注意不够；同时，由于种子数量不足，不得不临时调用粮仓混杂小麦。今年各地麦田面积扩大，要及早着手准备种子，以保证种子的质量。	  第三、提高播种质量，保证苗全苗壮
    种好的中心问题是保证“苗全、苗壮”。所谓苗全，是在一块地里有足够的苗数与均匀的分布，构成能够最大限度地利用光能和营养条件，而获得穗多、穗大、丰产的群体。关于种植密度，根据中国农业科学院栽培生理研究所统计，北京、山东、河南、陕西、湖北、云南等省、市进行的密植试验结果，平均以二十五万到三十万的基本苗产量为最高。从地区来看，南方以二十万到三十万苗，北方以二十五万到三十五万苗为宜。同时，因播种早晚，地力肥瘦、以及品种特性不同而有所出入。因此，必须在一定基本苗数的基础上，掌握苗、株、穗、粒各个生育时期动态的群体合理结构，才能最后获得密植增产的效果。基本苗指的是实际出苗数，究竟播多少种子，还要根据种子的大小、发芽率的高低、发芽势的强弱等来决定。在目前一般大田生产情况下，即使种子发芽率不太差，一般出苗率为70％上下，一斤种子约出一万苗。在南方粘土地区，以及北方干旱地区，或者整地质量较差的地块，出苗率有的仅为40％到50％。因此，必须根据实际可能的出苗数来确定播种量。
    除了掌握播种量外，播种方式对于保证植株合理分布、均衡生长有着密切关系。根据各地经验来看，北方采用四寸半到五寸窄行机播，南方采用四寸到五寸播幅、五寸到六寸的幅距的横埨宽幅条播，植株分布均匀，能够充分利用光能和营养空间，这是目前比较适宜的播种方式。在这里值得介绍的，是安徽六安县渒东公社创造“里稀外稠”的宽幅条播方法，采用一种滚筒播种器，下籽幅全宽五寸，两侧各二寸有排子眼，中间一寸无孔，这样可以保证播幅内种子分布“里稀外稠”，从而克服幅内植株透光不良，生长不佳的缺点。此外，在套种地区有采用“二密一稀”（二窄行一宽行），以及“小三行”（三窄行一宽行）等方式，这对于早期透光及以后套种夏播作物有好处。精选种子对提高播种质量有着重要作用。粒大的种子营养物质较多，能够增强发芽势和发芽整齐度，小麦生育初期也很健壮。因此，采用风选、筛选或水选等方法精选种子，是一项经济有效的增产措施。
    适期播种不仅是充分利用自然条件，促进麦苗在冬前有足够健壮分蘖和发育良好的根系，而且可以通过调整播种期来避免或减轻霜冻、锈病和干风等为害，对稳定高产有着十分重要的意义。播种过早，易于徒长拔节，发生冻害；播种过晚，年前分蘖少，幼苗生长弱，常易造成穗少、穗小，成熟期延迟而减产。所谓播种适期，从含义来说应该是反映产量最高的播种时期。因此，具体到不同品种或者不同地块，播种的适期是有所区别的，比如春性品种或者地力肥的地块播种宜较晚，冬性品种或者地力差的地块播种宜较早，但这仍为该品种或该地块的播种适期。确定播种时期，主要在于掌握冬前的温度条件，满足麦苗达到“壮而不旺”生长的热量需要。具有一定数量的分蘖是壮苗的重要标志之一。从各地丰产田的材料来看，在冬前北方麦区单株分蘖达到三到五个（每亩分蘖数九十万到一百一十万），中部麦区达到三到四个（每亩分蘖数八十万到一百万），南方麦区达到二到三个（每亩分蘖数七十万到九十万），较为适宜。小麦一般在摄氏零上三到五度停止分蘖。中国农业科学院农业气象研究室根据1953到1959年的资料统计：从播种到生长四个分蘖，大约需要高于摄氏三度的有效积温达三百五十到四百度。中国农业科学院江苏分院在南京研究结果，从播种到生长三个分蘖，大约需要高于摄氏三度的有效积温达四百度，相当于冬前生育四十多天。晋南农业科学研究所根据九年资料平均，最适播期温度指标是五厘米地温在摄氏二度以上的有效积温达三百八十到四百五十度，相当于一般年份冬前生育五十天，秋暖年份生育六十天。影响冬前分蘖的因子除温度外，水分、光照以及营养条件都有关系。如播种期稍迟，适当浇水和施肥也能促使幼苗分蘖生长；但温度条件仍然是主导的因素。根据各地群众的经验和播种期试验结果，从地区来说，北方麦区一般在9月中、下旬，中部麦区在10月上、中旬，长江流域麦区在10月中、下旬，华南麦区在11月中、下旬播种较为适宜。
    由于地区、茬口、土地条件的不同，种好小麦的着重点也有所不同。除了上述共同性技术措施之外，具体到一个地区或者一块麦田来说，还有其特殊性问题，这就需要认真总结当地经验和分析每块麦田的具体情况，订出相应的技术措施。
