Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: China's mechanical industry, in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, while actively creating new products, has reformed the old products of the mechanical industry and has achieved remarkable results. This mass movement to reform old products will not only greatly improve the production and technical level of China's mechanical industry, but will also have a huge and far-reaching impact on all sectors of the national economy.

In recent years, China's mechanical industry has produced many products and has also increased a lot of new products, which has played a significant role in equipping all sectors of the national economy and supporting the great leap forward in industry and agriculture. In order to further improve the efficiency and quality of mechanical products, since the launch of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement last winter, in implementing the Party Central Committee's policy of combining foreign and indigenous methods, walking on two legs, the mechanical industry's workers have also streamlined the structure, improved the efficiency and quality of some old products that were bulky or structurally complex but inefficient. At the same time, general old products have also been reformed to varying degrees. In the process of repeated reforms, new structures have emerged in mechanical products such as power generation equipment, heavy machinery, power machinery, irrigation and drainage machinery, welding machinery, instruments, and machine tools. Among them, more than 100 kinds of innovative products, such as reformed generators, refrigerators, water pumps, welded structure water turbines, combined machine tools, and lightweight belt conveyors, have been identified and finalized, and are being produced throughout the country; a large number of innovative products are still being trial-produced and finalized.

The basic characteristics of the innovative products that have been initially finalized or are nearing finalization are that they are more in line with the requirements of building socialism in a more, faster, better and more economical way. For example, the reformed single-axis automatic lathes, vertical drilling machines, generators, various water pumps, etc., have greatly reduced the number of parts and components, reduced the size, and reduced the weight, while ensuring the original performance, thereby greatly saving raw materials and man-hours. For example, an electrical equipment that has been reformed has reduced the number of parts from 182 types and 1,387 pieces to 93 types and 600 pieces, a reduction of more than half. Another indigenous lightweight spot welding machine has reduced its weight from 382 kilograms to 17 kilograms, turning a behemoth into a small and exquisite portable machine. Some reformed products have not only reduced their size and weight, but also greatly improved their efficiency. Such as the four-hopper meteor-type thread rolling machine, high-efficiency combined crusher, etc., all have improved efficiency by one to several times compared to the old products before the reform. These small, lightweight, and efficient innovative equipment can not only save materials, man-hours, production area, and shorten the production cycle for the mechanical industry, but also enable all industries that use machines to save infrastructure investment, infrastructure area, accelerate construction speed, develop new technologies and processes, improve production efficiency, and improve the labor conditions of workers.

Another significant feature of innovative products is that they are more adapted to China's resource situation, providing more favorable conditions for the rapid development of the mechanical industry. The reformed generators, steam turbines, electric motors, transformers, etc., mostly use materials that are suitable for China's resource conditions to replace the original imported materials, while the performance and efficiency remain unchanged. Many products, such as power machinery, electrical machinery, and chemical machinery, have greatly saved some alloy steel and non-ferrous metals compared to before the reform. The DC arc welding machine produced in Shanghai has saved some silicon steel sheets and shaft steel while ensuring quality.

A large number of innovative products are also more adapted to the characteristics of China's mechanical industry, which is vigorously developing many advanced new technologies. Many innovative products widely adopt various advanced new technologies that are actively promoted in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in their design structure, giving these new technologies a broad application. For example, many of the innovative products successfully trial-produced by various mechanical factories in Harbin adopt non-cutting and less-cutting processing technology. The successful trial production of large-scale assembled water turbines, rolling mills, etc. in Shanghai, Northeast China, and other places is the result of fully applying electroslag welding technology.

In order to improve the production efficiency of machine tools and meet the needs of metal processing, many mechanical factories have further transformed some old products into new machine tools that can be assembled and disassembled and have a very flexible structure. The high-efficiency special combined machine tools, power heads, universal building block machine tools, etc., which have been formally put into production by mechanical factories in Beijing, Tianjin, Harbin, and other places for hole processing and plane processing, are very convenient to change. If you want to change a part, you can take that part down to make changes without affecting other parts; when the entire equipment cannot meet the needs, it can also be completely disassembled and reassembled.

The mass movement of reforming old products in the mechanical industry in the technical innovation and technical revolution is unprecedented in terms of scale, scope, and depth. Due to the adoption of the "three-way combination" method inside and outside the factory, the enthusiasm of the vast number of mechanical manufacturing workers, mechanical designers, machine users, and scientific researchers has been fully mobilized, and a large number of new technologies and new technologies created by the vast number of workers in various industries in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement have been rapidly concentrated, thereby ensuring that a large number of old products are becoming better and better in the reform. Another huge achievement of this mass movement is that it quickly broke through many superstitions in design work with a large number of facts, such as thinking that "the more materials used, the stronger the machine" and "advanced equipment cannot be simplified." In addition, it also broke some outdated concepts in the mechanical industry, such as "products of modern large-scale enterprises are good, and products of small and medium-sized enterprises must be bad," and so on. These ideological liberations have a very profound significance for the continuous progress of China's mechanical industry.

　　更加符合多快好省要求　更加适应我国资源情况
　　机械工业革新老产品群众运动成就辉煌
　　一百多种革新产品已经定型生产，大量革新产品正在继续试制
    新华社22日讯　我国机械工业在技术革新、技术革命运动中，积极创制新产品的同时，对机械工业老产品进行了改革，并已取得显著成就。这一改革老产品的群众运动，不仅大大提高了我国机械工业的生产和技术水平，同时对国民经济各部门也将发生巨大而深远的影响。
    几年来，我国机械工业生产了许多产品，也增加了很多新产品，这对于装备国民经济各部门、支援工农业大跃进，起了很大作用。为了进一步提高机械产品的效率和质量，从去年冬季技术革新和技术革命运动开展以来，在贯彻执行党中央的洋土并举、两条腿走路的方针中，机械工业的职工群众，又对一些体态臃肿或结构繁复而效率不高的老产品，进行了精简结构、提高效率和质量的工作，同时，对一般老产品，也进行了不同程度的改革。在反复改革过程中，发电设备、重型机械、动力机械、排灌机械、焊接机械、仪表、机床等类别的机械产品里，并出现了一些新结构的产品。其中改革后的发电机、冷冻机、水泵、拼焊结构水轮机、拼合式机床、轻便式皮带运输机等一百多种革新产品，经过鉴定定型，正在全国各地生产；还有大量的革新产品正在继续试制和定型。
    已经初步定型或接近定型的革新产品，基本的特点是更加符合多快好省地建设社会主义的要求。例如，经过改革后的单轴自动车床、立式钻床、发电机、各种水泵等，都在保证原有各种性能的条件下，大大减少了零件、部件，缩小了体积，减轻了重量，从而大大节省了原料和工时。例如经过改革的一种电器设备，零件由一百八十二种一千三百八十七件改为九十三种六百件，共减少了一半以上。另一种土轻便点焊机，重量从三百八十二公斤减轻到十七公斤，把一个庞然大物变成了小巧灵珑的手提式机器。一部分经过改革的产品，不仅缩小了体积，减轻了重量，还大大提高了效率。如四斗流星式滚丝机、高效率联合破碎机等，都比改革以前的老产品分别提高效率一倍到几倍。这些体积小、重量轻、效率高的革新设备，不仅能使机械工业节省材料、工时、生产面积和缩短生产周期，而且它能使使用机器的各行各业节省基建投资、基建面积、加快建设速度、发展新技术、新工艺、提高生产效率和改善职工的劳动条件。
    革新产品的另一个显著特点，是更加适应了我国的资源情况，为机械工业的迅速发展提供了更有利的条件。改革后的发电机、汽轮机、电动机、变压器等，大都采用适合我国资源条件的材料，代替原来进口的材料，而性能和效率不变。还有许多产品如动力机械、电工机械、化工机械中经过改革的产品，都比改革以前大大节省了某些合金钢和有色金属。上海生产的直流弧焊机经过改革，在保证质量的情况下节约了一部分矽钢片和轴钢。
    大量的革新产品，也更加适应了我国机械工业正在大力发展许多先进新工艺的特点。很多革新产品在设计结构中，广泛地采用了技术革新和技术革命运动中积极推广的各种先进新工艺，使这些新工艺有了广阔的用武之地。例如哈尔滨各机械工厂试制成功的革新产品中，不少产品都采用了无切削和少切削加工工艺。上海、东北等地试制成功大型拼合结构水轮机、轧钢机等，则是充分应用电渣焊工艺的结果。
    为了提高机床的生产效率，适应金属加工方面的需要，许多机械厂进一步把一些老产品改成了可拼可装、结构非常灵便的新机床。北京、天津、哈尔滨等地机械工厂已经开始正式生产的、用于孔加工和平面加工的高效率专用组合机床、动力头、万能积木式机床等等，改变起来都很方便，愿意改那一部分，就可以把那一部分拿下来进行改变而不影响其它部分；整个设备不能满足需要时，还可以全部拆掉重新拼合。
    机械工业在技术革新和技术革命中改革老产品的群众运动，无论在规模、范围、和深度方面，都是空前的。由于采用了厂内、厂外“三结合”的办法，充分调动了广大机械制造工人、机械设计人员、机器使用者和科学研究人员的积极性，迅速集中了技术革新和技术革命运动中各行业广大职工创造的大量新工艺、新技术，从而保证了大量的老产品在改革中愈改愈好。这一个群众运动的另一巨大成就，是以大量的事实迅速冲破了许多设计工作中的迷信，如认为“用的材料愈多，机器就愈结实”、“高级设备不能简化”等。此外，也打破了在机械工业中的一些陈旧观念，如“现代化大型企业的产品好、中小型企业的产品一定不好”等等。这些思想上的解放，对于我国机械工业的不断进步有非常深远的意义。
