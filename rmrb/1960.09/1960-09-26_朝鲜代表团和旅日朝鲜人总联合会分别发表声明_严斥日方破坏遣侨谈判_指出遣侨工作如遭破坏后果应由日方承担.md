Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: Tokyo Dispatch: The Korean Red Cross delegation issued a farewell statement today before leaving Niigata, strongly condemning the Japanese side for undermining the negotiations between the Red Cross Societies of Korea and Japan on extending the agreement on repatriating Korean residents in Japan.
　　The Korean Red Cross delegation returned home by repatriation ship this afternoon. Approximately 5,000 representatives from all walks of life in Japan and the people of Niigata City went to the pier to see them off.
　　The farewell statement pointed out that the actions taken by the representatives of the Japanese Red Cross at this negotiation trampled on humanitarian principles and international faith in a brutal manner. The statement said that the Korean Red Cross delegation strongly condemned this political conspiracy by the Japanese Red Cross to openly undermine the negotiations.
　　The statement pointed out that it was clear that the Japanese side proposed holding this negotiation from the beginning with the aim of undermining the repatriation work of Korean residents in Japan.
　　The statement pointed out that Korean residents in Japan were driven to Japan due to the past implementation of a vicious colonial rule by Japanese imperialism and have endured a life of suffering. The Japanese government should bear full responsibility for their lives and repatriation issues.
　　The statement condemned the Japanese government for not only failing to fulfill its responsibilities, but also colluding with U.S. imperialism to undermine repatriation work.
　　The statement said that the Japanese side must continue to repatriate Korean residents in Japan who wish to return to their country in accordance with the current agreement. The statement stated that the Korean side welcomes the return of compatriots in Japan to their motherland.
　　The statement emphasized that if the repatriation work is sabotaged in the future, the Japanese side should be responsible for all serious consequences.
　　The statement concluded by saying that the Korean Red Cross delegation is convinced that no political conspiracy can frustrate the desire of Korean residents in Japan to return to their motherland.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 24th: Tokyo Dispatch: The General Association of Korean Residents in Japan issued a statement today, strongly condemning the Japanese government for undermining the negotiations on extending the agreement on repatriating Korean residents in Japan, and expressed the determination of Korean residents in Japan to unite closely with the Japanese people and take active actions to realize the extension of the repatriation agreement.
　　The statement pointed out that the Japanese government should be responsible for all the consequences that may arise from undermining the repatriation negotiations.
