Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd—The city of Maracaibo, capital of the oil-rich Zulia State in Venezuela, held a demonstration yesterday afternoon against the "Declaration of San José," which was recently passed by the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas and which interferes in Cuba. Demonstrators burned an American flag. Police attacked the demonstrators and arrested some people. Jesús Andrade, a leader of the Communist Party of Zulia State, was also arrested at night.

The Venezuelan Federation of University Students issued a statement saying that Venezuelan university students and people oppose and do not recognize the so-called "Declaration of San José." The statement said, "Venezuelan students and people bear no obligation whatsoever to this declaration, and they all have a responsibility to infinitely strengthen the forces of solidarity defending Cuba."

Youth from all walks of life in Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, held a rally in the auditorium of the National University in support of the Cuban Revolution.

The Mexican Revolutionary Student League also issued a statement supporting Cuba's position at the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas.

Xinhua News Agency, September 1st—Public opinion in Latin American countries continues to condemn the United States for forcing through resolutions interfering in Cuba at the Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Americas in Costa Rica.

The Brazilian "Jornal do Brasil" published a commentary saying: The "Declaration of San José" passed at the meeting was drafted on an unmentionable basis. The newspaper pointed out that the opposition of the Venezuelan Foreign Minister, who had to withdraw from the meeting, to the resolutions imposed on the meeting by the United States is a powerful testament to resistance. This resistance will inevitably resonate in Venezuela and all Latin American countries.

The Argentinian weekly "Acción" published an article entitled "A Waste Paper of This Century," pointing out, "The Costa Rican meeting has failed, and that is (U.S. Secretary of State) Herter's failure. The United States has once again lost prestige in the eyes of the world." The commentary said that at this meeting, the Argentinian government played an unfortunate role. But the Argentinian people have nothing to do with this despicable diplomacy that betrays brotherly countries. The Argentinian people stand with Cuba against the United States. They warmly support Castro.

The Uruguayan "El Popular" published a commentary pointing out that the "Declaration of San José" is used to tighten the steel ring around the liberation movement of the Latin American people. Those Latin American governments that participated in signing this declaration will have to face the people of their own countries, who have shown through their active struggle that the cause of the Cuban revolution is their own cause, and they are ready to defend it.

The Colombian "Voz de la Democracia" published a commentary saying that the people of Latin American countries are standing up in support of the Cuban people's movement. The Cuban people's unwavering determination to defend national sovereignty, and the support of the Cuban revolution by the people of Latin America and the world, will inevitably destroy the colonialist policies of the United States. Today, imperialism is continuing down its path of failure until its complete demise. At the same time, the sun of freedom and justice has risen in the Americas.

    拉丁美洲人民不承认“圣约瑟宣言”
    委内瑞拉乌拉圭群众示威集会支持古巴人民
    巴西阿根廷哥伦比亚舆论反对美国干涉行为
    据新华社2日讯　在委内瑞拉盛产石油的苏里亚州首府马拉开波城昨天下午举行了示威游行，反对美洲外长会议最近通过的干涉古巴的“圣约瑟宣言”。示威群众烧掉了一面美国国旗。警察袭击示威者并逮捕了一些人。苏里亚州共产党领导人赫苏斯·安德拉德也在夜间被捕。
    委内瑞拉大学生联合会发表声明说，委内瑞拉大学生和人民反对和不承认所谓“圣约瑟宣言”。声明说，“委内瑞拉学生和人民对这个宣言丝毫不承担义务，他们都有责任无限地加强保卫古巴的声援力量。”
    乌拉圭首都蒙得维的亚各界青年在国立大学礼堂举行了一次支持古巴革命的大会。
    墨西哥革命学生联盟也发表声明，支持古巴在美洲国家外长会议上的立场。
    据新华社1日讯　拉丁美洲各国舆论继续谴责美国在哥斯达黎加美洲外长会议上强使通过干涉古巴的决议。
    巴西“新闻日报”发表评论说：会议通过的“圣约瑟宣言”是在不可告人的基础上拟订的。这家报纸指出，不得不退出会议的委内瑞拉外交部长对美国强加于会议的决议所表示的反对态度，是有力的反抗的明证。这种反抗将不可避免地在委内瑞拉和所有拉丁美洲国家中产生反响。
    阿根廷“行动”周刊以“本世纪的一纸废文”为题发表文章指出，“哥斯达黎加会议已经失败了，这就是（美国国务卿）赫脱的失败。美国再一次在全世界面前丧失了威信”。评论说，在这次会议上，阿根廷政府扮演了倒霉的角色。但是阿根廷人民与这种背弃兄弟国家的卑劣的外交毫无关系。阿根廷人民同古巴站在一起反对美国。他们热烈地支持卡斯特罗。
    乌拉圭“人民报”发表评论指出，“圣约瑟宣言”是用来收紧套在拉丁美洲人民解放运动身上的钢圈的。那些参与签署这项宣言的拉丁美洲国家政府将不得不面对他们自己国家的人民，这些国家的人民已经通过他们的积极斗争表明，古巴革命的事业就是他们自己的事业，他们已经准备好去保卫它。
    哥伦比亚“民主呼声报”发表评论说，拉丁美洲各国人民正在支持古巴人民的运动中站立起来。古巴人民保卫国家主权的坚定不移的决心、拉丁美洲和世界各国人民对古巴革命的支援，这一切必将摧毁美国的殖民主义政策。今天，帝国主义正在继续走它的失败的道路，直到全部灭亡。与此同时，自由和正义的太阳已经在美洲升起。
