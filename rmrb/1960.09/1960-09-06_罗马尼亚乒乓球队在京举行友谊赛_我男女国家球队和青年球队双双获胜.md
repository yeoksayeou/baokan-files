Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Romanian men's and women's table tennis teams played their first friendly matches in China against the Chinese men's and women's table tennis teams in Beijing on the evening of the 3rd. As a result, the Chinese teams won both the men's and women's team events. The score for the women's team was three to one, and for the men's team, it was five to one.

More than six thousand spectators watched the exciting performances of the players from both countries at the Beijing Gymnasium competition hall.

The Chinese team that played on the evening of the 3rd were all "attack-oriented" players with straight grips. The men's team members were Rong Guotuan, Wang Chuanyao, and Xu Yinsheng, and the women's team members were Sun Meiying and Qiu Zhonghui. All of the visiting team members used shakehand grips and could both defend and attack. The men's team members were 19-year-old European singles runner-up Negulescu, 17-year-old European mixed doubles champion Cobîrzan, and athlete Popescu; the women's team members were 20-year-old European mixed doubles champion Alexandru and athlete Pitica.

The women's team competition was the most intense, with three of the four matches going to three games to decide the winner. In the first match, Sun Meiying won against Alexandru two to one, but in the second match, Qiu Zhonghui lost to Pitica one to two, bringing the score to one to one. In the third match, the doubles match, Sun Meiying and Qiu Zhonghui fought fiercely with their opponents. After tying at twenty in the third game, they continuously smashed the ball, finally winning twenty-two to twenty. At this point, the Chinese team was ahead two to one. In the fourth match, Qiu Zhonghui met Alexandru. Qiu aggressively attacked and won two to zero, securing a three to one victory for the Chinese team.

In the men's team's six matches, four of them also went to three games to decide the winner. Guest team's Negulescu, with his comprehensive technique, put on an outstanding performance and defeated Wang Chuanyao two to one. The score in the third game of this match was twenty-four to twenty-two.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Romanian men's and women's table tennis teams held friendly matches with the Chinese youth men's and women's table tennis teams in Beijing on the afternoon of the 4th. The Chinese youth men's and women's teams won the team events with scores of five to zero and three to one respectively.

In the friendly matches on the 4th, the Chinese players, skilled at straight-grip attacking, and the guest team players, who were able to both attack and defend, gave wonderful performances. At times, one side was attacking while the other defended, and at other times, both sides engaged in rapid rallies, drawing bursts of applause from the audience. In the nine matches, five of them were decided after three games of intense competition. The visiting team's one victory on the 4th came when experienced athlete Pitica defeated our young female player Wang Jian two to zero in the women's team competition. The match between Pitica and Hu Keming was also very intense. Last year, at the Eight-Nation International Table Tennis Championships held in Hungary, Hu Keming lost to Pitica two to three in the singles competition, but on the 4th, Hu Keming used powerful smashes to defeat his opponent two to one.

In the men's team competition, the match between Romania's national champion Negulescu, who is good at both attacking and defending, and Zhuang Zedong, aroused great interest among the audience. Zhuang Zedong used powerful smashes to win the first game twenty-one to twelve. Subsequently, Negulescu, with his shakehand grip, used low and spinning chops to curb Zhuang Zedong's offensive, while also seizing opportunities to score with fast backhand shots, winning back a game twenty-one to fourteen. In the third game, Zhuang Zedong took the initiative with fierce attacks, finally winning twenty-one to fifteen.

The Romanian table tennis team left Beijing for Guangzhou on the evening of the 4th and is scheduled to play a friendly match with the Guangdong table tennis team there on the 7th.

    我男女国家球队和青年球队双双获胜
    据新华社讯　罗马尼亚男女乒乓球队3日晚在北京同中国男女乒乓球队举行访华第一场友谊比赛，结果中国队在男女团体赛中都获得胜利，女子队的比数是三比一，男子队是五比一。
    六千多观众在北京体育馆比赛馆里观看了两国选手精彩表演。
    中国队3日晚上场的都是直握球拍的“攻击型”选手，男队队员是容国团、王传耀、徐寅生，女队队员是孙梅英、丘钟惠。客队队员全是横握球拍而且能守能攻，男队队员是十九岁的欧洲单打亚军内古莱斯库、十七岁的欧洲混合双打冠军科比赞和运动健将波佩斯库；女队队员是二十岁的欧洲混合双打冠军亚历山德鲁和运动健将皮蒂卡。
    女子团体赛最紧张，四场比赛中有三场打了三局才分胜负。第一场孙梅英以二比一赢了亚历山德鲁，但第二场丘钟惠以一比二败给了皮蒂卡，场上比分成一比一。第三场双打，孙梅英、丘钟惠同对方争夺激烈，第三局打成二十平后，连连扣中，才以二十二比二十获胜。这时，中国队以二比一领先。第四场丘钟惠和亚历山德鲁相遇，丘猛抽猛攻，以二比○赢了对方，使中国队以三比一获胜。
    男子队的六场比赛中，也有四场打了三局才分胜负。客队内古莱斯库技术全面，表演出色，曾以二比一战胜王传耀。这场比赛第三局的比数是二十四比二十二。　　据新华社讯　罗马尼亚男女乒乓球队4日下午在北京同中国青年男女乒乓球队举行友谊比赛，中国青年男女队在团体赛中分别以五比零和三比一获胜。
    在4日的友谊比赛中，善于直拍攻球的中国选手同能攻能守的客队选手表演精彩，场上时而是一个攻一个守，时而是双方展开快速的对攻，观众掌声一阵接着一阵。在九场比赛中，有五场都是经过三局激烈争夺才分胜负的。客队4日取得的一场胜利，是有经验的运动健将皮蒂卡在女子团体赛中以二比零击败了我国年轻女选手王健。皮蒂卡对胡克明的一场比赛也很紧张。去年在匈牙利举行八国国际乒乓球锦标赛时，胡克明在单打比赛中曾以二比三输给皮蒂卡，但胡克明4日用有力的抽杀以二比一战胜了对方。
    在男子团体赛中，罗马尼亚能攻善守的全国冠军内古莱斯库同庄则栋的比赛，引起观众很大兴趣。庄则栋用大板抽杀首先以二十一比十二赢得一局。随后，横握球拍的内古莱斯库一方面用低而旋转的削球遏止庄则栋的攻势，一方面伺机用快速的反拍抽球得分，以二十一比十四扳回一局。到第三局，庄则栋以猛烈攻势掌握主动，最后以二十一比十五获胜。
    罗马尼亚乒乓球队4日晚离北京去广州，预定7日在那里同广东乒乓球队举行友谊比赛。
