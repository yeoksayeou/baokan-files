In the Presidential Palace of Sékou Touré
　　Yang Shuo
　　I have a very deep impression of the people of Guinea, and I always feel like they are cast from pig iron. The capital of Guinea, Conakry, is full of iron ore, and the people's skeletons are so black and strong, which naturally gives me this impression, but the more important reason is their strong will, which cannot but make me think of iron. Whenever I meet friends in Guinea, they are always so enthusiastic and full of victorious confidence in their newly emerging republic.
　　This confidence is gained through struggle. You only need to look back slightly to see how long and painful a road the Guinean people have traveled. That road is sprinkled with blood and sweat, but they finally smashed the iron yoke that imperialism had placed on their necks for many years, and like a blazing torch, it was planted on the Atlantic coast of West Africa, shining with the light of independence and freedom.
　　In Sékou Touré, the spirit of freedom shines. In April of this year, we went to Conakry to participate in an international conference. One night, Touré held a grand reception for the representatives of the countries attending the conference. That day, I happened to be held up by something and was late. The garden of the Presidential Palace was already crowded with people, and the dance had begun. I quietly approached the crowd, intending to stand aside. Suddenly, a person walked out of the shadows and extended his hand, saying, "Hello? Dear Chinese friend."
　　This was President Touré. He was wearing a black tuxedo, full of energy, and moved freely. The expression on his face was both pleasant and confident.
　　I quickly shook his hand and said, "Hello? Please forgive me for being late..."
　　He interrupted me with a smile and said, "Not late at all, you have come at just the right time. Have you eaten anything? Or should you go and eat something first?" He then ordered someone to lead me into the Presidential Palace.
　　The Presidential Palace is a beautiful white building. Without asking, one can guess that this must have been the place where the rulers of French imperialism lived in luxury, but now it has been returned to its rightful owners. The long tables in the hall were filled with all kinds of fresh tropical foods, including mangoes, coconuts, and a rare fruit called "Awukdu," which contains a large amount of oil and tastes particularly fragrant. I picked a plate of food and went to sit on the side to eat. I inadvertently noticed a portrait of an old man hanging on the wall, looking to be sixty or seventy years old, wearing a Guinean robe, with a very determined expression. Whose portrait could this be? It was hanging in the Presidential Palace. I pondered, but couldn't find an answer.
　　At this time, the dance party in the garden stopped, and the African ballet was about to begin. I hurried out of the hall. What a charming African night. The air was so warm and humid, filled with the fragrance of mango blossoms and various unknown flowers and plants. The African ballet was performed to a strong musical rhythm. This was the first time in my life that I had appreciated true Black African dance. The dance depicted the lives, labor, love, and anti-imperialist struggles of the Guinean people. The movements were very rough and powerful, grabbing my attention tightly. Several rows of Guinean women were sitting on the high platform beside me, all draped in brightly colored light纱. During the dance breaks, they all sang in unison in a low voice. They were singing in the local Susu language, which we didn't understand, but we often heard the name Maria floating in the night sky. It didn't sound like a love song, so what kind of song could it be? Later, I found out that the song was about a female hero named Maria, who resented the brutal oppression of French imperialism, rose up to resist, was arrested by the French, tortured in every possible way, but never yielded, and finally bravely sacrificed herself. She lost her own life, but her life became a song, forever and forever circulating among the Guinean people.
　　That night, there was music, there was dance, and there were songs, all of which were enough to express the indestructible fighting spirit of this nation. There were many people attending the party, and I didn't see President Touré again, but his unusually kind feelings could be felt from every Guinean friend.
　　As for who the old man in the painting was, it wasn't until recently that a comrade who was more familiar with Guinean history told me: The old man was called Almamy Samori Touré, a prominent national hero of Guinea who, at the end of the last century, organized armed resistance against the French invaders. It is said that the old man was President Touré's ancestor, but in fact, he was also the ancestor of the Guinean people, who have a rich revolutionary tradition.
　　Today, as President Touré flies to Beijing from distant Conakry, I can't help but recall what he said that night. He said, "You have come at just the right time." I always feel that his words have a profound meaning. In order to defeat the US-led imperialist aggression against the people of Asia and Africa, don't we need to strengthen our unity and support each other in a timely manner? Dear Mr. President, your arrival is precisely to bring the Guinean people's support to us in a timely manner. Please accept our heartfelt cheers.

### 在塞古·杜尔总统府里

    在塞古·杜尔总统府里
    杨朔
    我对几内亚人民有一个极深的印象，总觉得他们好像是生铁铸成的。几内亚的首都科纳克里遍地都是铁矿，人民的骨架又是那样黑而有力，自然会给我这种印象，但更重要的缘由却是他们那种刚强的意志，不由不使我联想到铁。凡是我在几内亚遇见的朋友，一谈起来，他们总是那样热情，对自己新兴的共和国满怀着胜利的信心。
    这种信心是从斗争中取得的。你只要稍微一回头，就会瞟见几内亚人民曾经走过多么悠长而痛苦的道路。那条道路上洒满血，也洒满汗，但他们终于砸碎帝国主义多年套在他们脖子上的铁枷，像一支熊熊的火炬似地插在西非洲的大西洋岸上，闪耀着独立自由的光芒。
    在塞古·杜尔身上，自由的精神就在放光。今年4月间，我们到科纳克里去参加一个国际性会议，有一天夜晚，杜尔为会议的各国代表举行一次隆重的接待会。那天恰巧我有事情牵扯着，到迟了，总统府的花园里已经挤满人，开始了舞会。我静静地走近人圈子，打算立在一边，灯影里忽然走过来一个人，伸出手说：“你好？亲爱的中国朋友。”
    这是杜尔总统。他穿着一身黑色的晚礼服，精力充沛，举动洒脱，脸上的表情显得又愉快，又自信。
    我连忙握着他的手说：“你好？请原谅我来晚了……”
    他笑着插断我的话说：“一点不晚，你们来得正及时。吃东西没有？还是先去吃点什么吧。”便吩咐人领我走进总统府去。
    总统府是座漂亮的白楼，不问也猜得到这原先必是法帝国主义统治者养尊处优的地方，现在却归还它应该属于的主人了。大厅里的长案子上摆满各种新鲜的热带食品，有芒果、有椰子，还有一种叫“阿乌克杜”的稀奇果子，里面含着大量的油质，味儿特别香。我拣了一盘子食品，走到一边坐着吃，无意中发现墙上挂着一幅老人的画像，模样儿有六、七十岁，穿着一件几内亚长袍，神情很刚毅。这会是谁的画像呢？能挂在总统府里。我寻思着，也找不到解答。
    这时花园里舞会停止，非洲芭蕾舞就要上场表演，我急忙走出大厅。多迷人的非洲的夜晚啊。空气是那么温暖而潮润，飘散着芒果花以及各种不知名花草的香味。非洲芭蕾舞在强烈的音乐节奏下演出了。这还是我有生头一次欣赏真正的黑非洲舞蹈。舞蹈中表演着几内亚人民的生活、劳动、爱情，以及反帝斗争等故事，动作十分粗犷有力，紧紧地抓住我的注意力。我的身旁高台上坐着几排几内亚妇女，一律披着颜色鲜艳的轻纱，舞蹈休息的当儿，她们就一齐曼声唱起来。唱的是当地的苏苏语，我们都不懂，只听见常有玛丽亚的名字飘荡在夜空里。这不像情歌，会是什么歌儿呢？后来才打听明白，原来歌唱的是个叫玛丽亚的女英雄，她气恨法帝国主义的残暴压迫，起来反抗，被法国人逮捕去，百般拷打，始终不屈服，最后勇敢地牺牲了。她失去自己的生命，她的生命却变成一支歌，永远永远流传在几内亚人民当中。
    这一夜，有音乐，有舞蹈，也有歌曲，样样都足以表现出这个民族坚不可摧的战斗精神。参加晚会的人很多，我再没看见杜尔总统，他那异常亲切的情谊却可以从每个几内亚朋友身上感觉得到。
    至于那幅画上的老人究竟是谁呢？直到最近，一位比较熟识几内亚历史的同志才告诉我说：老人叫安马米·沙马雷·杜尔，是几内亚杰出的民族英雄，上一个世纪末，曾经组织武装和法国侵略者进行过激烈的战斗。都说老人就是杜尔总统的祖先，其实也就是富有革命传统的几内亚人民的祖先。
    今天，当杜尔总统从遥远的科纳克里飞临北京，我不觉记起他那晚上所说的话。他说：“你们来得正及时。”我总觉得他的话里含着深远的意味。为着战胜以美国为首的帝国主义对亚非人民的侵略罪行，我们不是正需要加紧团结，及时地互相支持么？亲爱的总统阁下，你的来临，正是及时地带来几内亚人民对我们的支持，请接受我们发自内心的欢呼吧。
