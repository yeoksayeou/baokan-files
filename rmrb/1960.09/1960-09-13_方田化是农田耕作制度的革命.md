Square-Shaped Fields are a Revolution in Farmland Farming Systems
		The 3.7 million farmers in the Jinan area have launched a vigorous agricultural revolution movement centered on building new socialist square fields. This spring, in just over 50 days, the entire area realized socialist square-shaped fields on more than 8 million mu of farmland.
		This square-shaped field movement, with water, fertilizer, and soil as its core content, based on the spirit of looking at the long term and starting with the immediate, and with the county as the unit, combined the county and commune, broke the boundaries of teams, districts, and communes, and carried out a revolution in the farming system and basic construction of all farmland according to the natural terrain and the needs of high-speed production development. The first step was large-scale land leveling and consolidation. Leveling highs and filling lows, straightening curves, and turning fragmented plots of more than 8 million mu of farmland into more than 70,000 new square fields (averaging 100 mu per plot) with flat land and straight ridges stretching as far as the eye could see. Pigsties, sheepfolds, and large livestock pens were built in the new square fields, implementing the "three pens" to the fields and vigorously accumulating fertilizer. High-standard square fields (accounting for 60% of the square field area) were fertilized with more than 10,000 jin, and deep plowing (cotton autumn fields) was carried out to a depth of 8 inches to 1 foot. General square fields were also fertilized with about 8,000 jin, and deep plowing was carried out to a depth of 6 inches or more. This completely eliminated backward land plots such as remote land and interspersed land, as well as infertile land that was not fertilized or deeply plowed. At the same time, soil mounds were cut down in the cultivated land, and curved and unreasonable roads and canals were eliminated. According to the plan of 10,000 mu as a cultivation area, with a thousand-mu large square within the area and a hundred-mu small square, cross-shaped mechanized farming roads and irrigation canals were built within the area, cross-shaped main roads and branch canals were built within the thousand-mu square, and pedestrian lanes and capillary canals were built within the hundred-mu small square. Forest belts were built along the canals and roads. The land increased by canceling canals and roads was offset by the land occupied by new canals and roads, resulting in a net increase of more than 70,000 mu of cultivated land.
		In the hilly and arid areas, the construction of new square fields is in blocks of ten mu, squares of one hundred mu, and walls of one thousand or ten thousand mu, with each block of land flat and straight, each square equipped with drought wells, and each wall with protective forest belts and pig, sheep, and livestock pens; in the gullies and river areas of the mountainous areas, garden-like and terrace-like fields are realized, and protective forests and reservoirs are built in the gullies; in the slope areas, horizontal terraces are realized, and ponds and drought wells are strung together; in the mountainous, hilly, and arid areas connected to the new square fields, high-standard water and soil conservation is realized on barren mountains and slopes.
		After this series of revolutions in farmland farming systems and basic construction, the unreasonable farming systems left over from the small-scale peasant economy were completely and thoroughly eliminated, thus greatly changing the natural landscape, making the production process increasingly reasonable, and clearing the obstacles for the high-speed development of agricultural production.
		The new socialist square field is a new development of the high-yield square. It not only has all the advantages of the high-yield square, but also has a more far-reaching revolutionary significance than the high-yield square.
		The high-yield square only implements land consolidation, doubles fertilization, and intensive cultivation on a part of the land. The new square field, however, is based on the need to change the natural landscape and develop agricultural production at high speed, and carries out unified division, consolidation, and leveling of all farmland, and makes a comprehensive and unified plan for farmland, roads, canals, wells, and residential areas with farmland basic construction as the center, making the whole land like a chessboard and the garden fields like a painting. This not only turns low-yield fields into high-yield fields and makes high-yield fields even higher, overcomes the excessive disparity in farmland yields, increases the total agricultural output, but also promotes the gradual disappearance of the gap between rich and poor caused by the uneven fertility of the land and the different management of the management areas. At the same time, it can also unite a large amount of manpower, material resources, and land into a huge whole, greatly promote farmland basic construction, and open up a broad road for the comprehensive and thorough application of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. In the past, although the requirements for cultivation standards were put forward when the land was scattered, it was difficult to act according to the technical requirements on all farmland. The new square fields are neatly sized, clear at a glance, and it is easy to plan and check how many seedlings to leave per mu, how much fertilizer to apply, and how much water to irrigate. Not only that, it is also easier to uniformly plan residential areas, providing a good start for gradually realizing "square fields are workshops and residential areas are dormitories" and gradually eliminating the gap between urban and rural areas.
		The new square field implements the principle of taking grain as the key link, developing all five industries simultaneously, and unified layout, according to the grand ideal of making the land a garden, and sets up production bases for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. For example, the "five-industry high-yield network" of the Feiyue Commune in Lüliang County includes 4,500 mu of cultivated land, 1,000 mu of low mounds, shallow ditches, and gentle slopes, and 2,500 mu of barren mountains and slopes. They built the cultivated land into 45 hundred-mu squares, divided into eight planting areas. Timber forests were built on the gentle slopes of low mounds and shallow ditches, and agricultural (feed) and forest intercropping were implemented on the fruit tree and timber forest bases; cave dwellings were built in layers on the field heads and ditch cliffs, and field cattle, sheep, and pig pens were established to implement remote land near planting, and on-site accumulation and application of fertilizer; and 10,000-fish ponds and 100-duck ponds were built by using ditch-side reservoirs. This achieves taking grain as the key link, developing all five industries simultaneously, promoting each other, feeding animal husbandry with agriculture, promoting agriculture with animal husbandry, protecting agriculture with forestry, and promoting forestry with agriculture, and comprehensive utilization.
		The new square field also promotes the development of agricultural science and technology and changes people's mental outlook. Various places have universally established small farm scientific experimental fields, technical research guidance rooms, crop archive record rooms, and meteorological observation stations with 10,000-mu cultivation areas as units, implementing science and technology to the fields, combining cadres, technicians, and the masses, and promoting the mass practice of science. The professional teams in the square are both production team members and scientific and technological research personnel, and they learn from each other, teach each other, learn while doing. This effectively promotes the development of agricultural science and technology and the rapid growth of the agricultural science and technology team. With technology entering the square, culture also entered the square, and field clubs, reading rooms, poetry competition stages, broadcasting, etc. were established one after another. At the same time, living welfare and militia training also entered the square, and simple field rest rooms, health stations, canteens, and mobile supply vehicles for daily necessities were established. This further enriched the construction of the new square field, making the commune members more happy and convenient in laboring and living in the square field.
		At the same time, since cadres uniformly dispatch and direct production on 10,000-mu square fields, cadres have rapidly increased their ability to lead the collective large-scale production of the people's commune. Since the masses of farmers collectively labor, entertain, learn, and live on 10,000-mu fields, the masses of farmers have rapidly strengthened the organization, discipline, and habits of large-scale collective production. Since it is necessary to work together, act in unison, and cooperate with each other in 10,000-mu square fields, this further trains and improves the communist ideological consciousness of cadres and the masses.
		Practice since the Great Leap Forward has proved that the policy of implementing multiple planting and multiple harvesting and high-yield and multiple harvesting "walking on two legs" is the correct way to increase grain production. The farming system combining small farm experimental fields, large-area high-yield fields, and general fields is a concrete method for implementing the policy of multiple planting and multiple harvesting and high-yield and multiple harvesting. Now, in the movement to build new socialist square fields, the broad masses have created the "four-field combination" farming system and the "four-unified and three-divided" management method, which have replaced the "three-field" combination farming system and solved the contradiction between the unified management of square fields and the people's commune's implementation of the three-level ownership system based on the team.
		The so-called "four fields": one refers to the command field, that is, the establishment of small farm scientific experimental fields in the cultivation area, and various production increase measures are first tested in the experimental field to gain experience and then promoted throughout the square, which is the command field of the cultivation area; the second is the high-standard square field accounting for 30% to 50% of the square field area, also called the central square or model field, which implements high-standard cultivation management and takes the first step in mechanization to accelerate the realization of the targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program; the third is the general square field accounting for 50% to 70% of the square field area, which realizes large-area high yield through farmland revolution and intensive cultivation management; and the fourth is the scattered small plots of land for planting feed and vegetables in the square field, which is the supplementary field. This contact system from the command field to the square field is a relatively scientific and complete farmland production system suitable for the current stage.
		The so-called "four unifications and three divisions": in the 10,000-mu cultivation area, implement unified leadership and command, unified planning, unified management standards, and unified crop archive records; the original communes and districts each operate, each accounting, and each bears its own profits and losses. This makes the cultivation area the basic unit for the people's commune to direct agricultural production, and the hundred-mu square the basic unit for crop management. This method of unified leadership of production by communes or communities, and investment and labor and profit distribution still according to the three-level ownership system based on the team, not only adheres to the principle of the three-level ownership system of the people's commune based on the team (management area), but also gives full play to the huge advantages of the people's commune's "large and public" in the organization and leadership of production and management.
		"Four-field combination" and "four-unified and three-divided" are concrete applications of the policy of "walking on two legs" of multiple planting and multiple harvesting and high-yield and multiple harvesting. In this way, it not only ensures the rapid development of current agricultural production, but also facilitates the gradual realization of the ideal of making the land a garden, continues to adhere to the principle of the three-level ownership system of the people's commune based on the team, and gives full play to the powerful advantages of the people's commune in developing production. This is a great creation of the broad masses under the leadership of the Party.

    方田化是农田耕作制度的革命	中共晋南地委办公室
    晋南区的三百七十万农民群众，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的以建设社会主义新方田为中心的农田革命运动。今年春天，仅仅五十多天，全区就在八百余万亩农田上实现了社会主义方田化。
    这次方田化运动，是以水肥土为中心内容，本着从远处着眼、近处着手的精神，以县为单位，县社结合，打破队、区、社界限，根据自然地形和高速度发展生产的需要，对全部农田进行了耕作制度的革命和基本建设。首先是进行了土地大平整、大连片。取高垫低、取楞补壑、取弯改直，把原来高低不平、地块零散的八百余万亩农田，变成了七万余块（平均每块一百亩）地平埂直、一望无际的新方田。在新方田内建起猪圈、羊圈和大牲畜圈，实行“三圈”到田和大闹积肥，高标准方田（占方田面积60％）施肥万斤以上，深耕
  （棉秋田）八寸至一尺，一般方田施肥也达八千斤左右，深耕六寸以上。这就彻底消灭了远地和插花地以及瘠薄地不施肥、不深耕等落后地片。同时，在耕地中削土岗，取消弯曲、不合理的道路和渠道。根据万亩为一个耕作区，区内千亩大方套百亩小方的规划，在区内建设起十字机耕路和引水渠，千亩方内建设起十字大路和支渠，百亩小方建设起人行便道和毛渠，渠旁、路旁造了林带。取消渠、路增加的土地与新建渠路占地相抵，净增耕地面积七万余亩。
    在丘陵旱垣地区，新方田的建设是十亩成块，百亩成方，千亩万亩成垣，块块地平埂直，方方旱井配套，垣垣有护垣林带和猪、羊、牲畜圈；在山区的沟、川地区，实现园田化、台田化，沟壑营造防护林和水库；在山坡地区，实现水平梯田化，涝池、旱井成串；在山区、丘陵旱垣地方与新方田相连的荒山荒坡上，实现了高标准水土保持化。
    经过这一系列农田耕作制度的革命和基本建设，全面彻底地革除了小农经济残留的不合理的耕作制度，因而大大改变了自然面貌，使生产过程日趋合理，为农业生产的高速度发展扫清了障碍。
    社会主义新方田是丰产方的新发展。它不仅具有丰产方的一切优越性，而且具有比丰产方更为深远的革命意义。
    丰产方只是在一部分土地上实行土地连片，加倍施肥，精细耕作。而新方田是根据改变自然面貌和高速度发展农业生产的需要，对全部农田进行统一划方连片和平整，并以农田基本建设为中心，对农田、道路、渠井和居民点进行全面统一的规划布局，使整个大地如棋盘，园田如画。这样既使低产田变高产田，高产田更高产，克服了农田产量过于悬殊，增加了农业总产量，又可促使管理区之间由于土地肥瘦不等、经营好坏不同所形成的穷富差别逐渐消失。同时，还可以把大量的人力、物力、土地联合成一个巨大的整体，大大推动农田基本建设，为全面彻底的综合运用农业“八字宪法”开辟了广阔的道路。过去，在土地零散的情况下，虽然也提出了耕作标准的要求，但要在全部农田上按技术要求办事，则是有困难的。新方田规格整齐，一目了然，一亩地留多少苗，施多少肥，浇多少水，都很容易计划和检查。不仅如此，更便于统一规划居民点，为逐步实现“方田是车间、居民点是宿舍”，逐步消灭城乡差别作了良好开端。
    新方田根据大地园林化的远大理想，贯彻了以粮为纲，五业并举，统一布局的方针，设置了农林牧副渔五业丰产基地。例如，吕梁县飞跃公社的“五业丰产网”，包括四千五百亩耕地，一千亩低峁浅沟和缓坡，两千五百亩荒山荒坡。他们把耕地建成了四十五个百亩方，分八个种植区域。在低峁浅沟的缓坡上营造了木材林，在果树林和木材林基地上实行农（饲料）、林间作；在地头、沟崖分层打窑洞，建立了田间牛、羊、猪圈，实行远地近种，就地积肥施肥；还利用沟壁水库，建立了万尾鱼池，百只鸭塘。这就作到了以粮为纲，五业并举，互相促进，以农养牧，以牧促农，以林护农，以农促林，综合利用。
    新方田还促进了农业科学技术的发展，改变了人们的精神面貌。各地普遍以万亩耕作区为单位，建立了小农场科学试验田、技术研究指导室、作物档案记载室和气象观测站，实行科学技术到田，干部、技术人员和群众三结合，大兴群众办科学之风。方内的专业队既是生产队人员，又是科学技术研究人员，而且以能者为师，互教互学，边学边干。这就有效地促进了农业科学技术的发展和农业科学技术队伍的迅速成长。随着技术进方，文化也进了方，相继建立起田间俱乐部、书报阅览室、赛诗台、广播等。同时，生活福利和民兵练武也随着进了方，建立了田间简易休息室、保健站、食堂和日用商品流动供应车。这就更加丰富了新方田的建设，使社员在方田内劳动和生活得更愉快、更方便。
    同时，由于干部在万亩方田上统一调度和指挥生产，就使干部迅速增长了领导人民公社集体大生产的才干。由于农民群众在万亩田上集体劳动、娱乐、学习和生活，就使农民群众迅速加强了大集体生产的组织性、纪律性和习惯。由于在万亩方田需要同心协力，统一行动，互相大协作，这就进一步锻炼提高了干部和群众的共产主义思想觉悟。
    大跃进以来的实践证明，实行多种多收和高产多收“两条腿走路”的方针，是增产粮食的正确的途径。而小农场试验田，大面积高产田和一般田相结合的耕作制度，是贯彻多种多收和高产多收方针的具体办法。现在在建设社会主义新方田运动中，广大群众创造了“四田结合”的耕作制度和“四统三分”的经营管理方法，又代替了“三田”结合的耕作制度，解决了方田统一经营和人民公社实行以队为基础的三级所有制的矛盾。
    所谓“四田”：一是指挥田，即耕作区内建立小农场科学试验田，各种增产措施先在试验田内取得经验，全方推广，这是耕作区的指挥田；二是占方田面积30％至50％的高标准方田，也叫中心方或样板田，实行高标准耕作管理和先一步机械化，加速实现全国农业发展纲要规定的指标；三是占方田面积50％至70％的一般方田，经过农田革命和精细耕作管理，实现大面积丰产；四是方块田种植饲料和蔬菜的零星小块土地，这是补充田。这种从指挥田到方块田，即方块的联系系统，是适合于现阶段的比较科学、完整的农田生产系统。
    所谓“四统三分”：是在万亩耕作区内，实行统一领导指挥，统一规划计划，统一经营标准，统一作物档案记载；由原来的社、区各自经营，各自核算，各负盈亏。这就使耕作区成了人民公社指挥农业生产的基本单位，百亩方成了农作物管理的基本单位。这种由社或社区联合统一领导生产，仍按以队为基础的三级所有制投资投工和收益分配的方法，既坚持了人民公社以队（管理区）为基础的三级所有制原则，又在生产的组织领导和经营管理上，充分发挥了人民公社“一大二公”的巨大优越性。
    “四田结合”、“四统三分”，都是多种多收和高产多收“两条腿走路”方针的具体运用。这样，既保证了当前农业生产迅速的发展，又便于逐步实现大地园林化的理想，继续坚持人民公社以队为基础的三级所有制的原则，充分发挥人民公社在发展生产上的强大优越性。这是广大群众在党的领导下的一个伟大创造。
