Square-Shaped Fields are a Revolution in Farmland Farming Systems
		The 3.7 million farmers in the Jinan area have launched a vigorous agricultural revolution movement centered on building new socialist square fields. This spring, in just over 50 days, the entire area realized socialist square-shaped fields on more than 8 million mu of farmland.
		This square-shaped field movement, with water, fertilizer, and soil as its core content, based on the spirit of looking at the long term and starting with the immediate, and with the county as the unit, combined the county and commune, broke the boundaries of teams, districts, and communes, and carried out a revolution in the farming system and basic construction of all farmland according to the natural terrain and the needs of high-speed production development. The first step was large-scale land leveling and consolidation. Leveling highs and filling lows, straightening curves, and turning fragmented plots of more than 8 million mu of farmland into more than 70,000 new square fields (averaging 100 mu per plot) with flat land and straight ridges stretching as far as the eye could see. Pigsties, sheepfolds, and large livestock pens were built in the new square fields, implementing the "three pens" to the fields and vigorously accumulating fertilizer. High-standard square fields (accounting for 60% of the square field area) were fertilized with more than 10,000 jin, and deep plowing (cotton autumn fields) was carried out to a depth of 8 inches to 1 foot. General square fields were also fertilized with about 8,000 jin, and deep plowing was carried out to a depth of 6 inches or more. This completely eliminated backward land plots such as remote land and interspersed land, as well as infertile land that was not fertilized or deeply plowed. At the same time, soil mounds were cut down in the cultivated land, and curved and unreasonable roads and canals were eliminated. According to the plan of 10,000 mu as a cultivation area, with a thousand-mu large square within the area and a hundred-mu small square, cross-shaped mechanized farming roads and irrigation canals were built within the area, cross-shaped main roads and branch canals were built within the thousand-mu square, and pedestrian lanes and capillary canals were built within the hundred-mu small square. Forest belts were built along the canals and roads. The land increased by canceling canals and roads was offset by the land occupied by new canals and roads, resulting in a net increase of more than 70,000 mu of cultivated land.
		In the hilly and arid areas, the construction of new square fields is in blocks of ten mu, squares of one hundred mu, and walls of one thousand or ten thousand mu, with each block of land flat and straight, each square equipped with drought wells, and each wall with protective forest belts and pig, sheep, and livestock pens; in the gullies and river areas of the mountainous areas, garden-like and terrace-like fields are realized, and protective forests and reservoirs are built in the gullies; in the slope areas, horizontal terraces are realized, and ponds and drought wells are strung together; in the mountainous, hilly, and arid areas connected to the new square fields, high-standard water and soil conservation is realized on barren mountains and slopes.
		After this series of revolutions in farmland farming systems and basic construction, the unreasonable farming systems left over from the small-scale peasant economy were completely and thoroughly eliminated, thus greatly changing the natural landscape, making the production process increasingly reasonable, and clearing the obstacles for the high-speed development of agricultural production.
		The new socialist square field is a new development of the high-yield square. It not only has all the advantages of the high-yield square, but also has a more far-reaching revolutionary significance than the high-yield square.
		The high-yield square only implements land consolidation, doubles fertilization, and intensive cultivation on a part of the land. The new square field, however, is based on the need to change the natural landscape and develop agricultural production at high speed, and carries out unified division, consolidation, and leveling of all farmland, and makes a comprehensive and unified plan for farmland, roads, canals, wells, and residential areas with farmland basic construction as the center, making the whole land like a chessboard and the garden fields like a painting. This not only turns low-yield fields into high-yield fields and makes high-yield fields even higher, overcomes the excessive disparity in farmland yields, increases the total agricultural output, but also promotes the gradual disappearance of the gap between rich and poor caused by the uneven fertility of the land and the different management of the management areas. At the same time, it can also unite a large amount of manpower, material resources, and land into a huge whole, greatly promote farmland basic construction, and open up a broad road for the comprehensive and thorough application of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. In the past, although the requirements for cultivation standards were put forward when the land was scattered, it was difficult to act according to the technical requirements on all farmland. The new square fields are neatly sized, clear at a glance, and it is easy to plan and check how many seedlings to leave per mu, how much fertilizer to apply, and how much water to irrigate. Not only that, it is also easier to uniformly plan residential areas, providing a good start for gradually realizing "square fields are workshops and residential areas are dormitories" and gradually eliminating the gap between urban and rural areas.
		The new square field implements the principle of taking grain as the key link, developing all five industries simultaneously, and unified layout, according to the grand ideal of making the land a garden, and sets up production bases for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. For example, the "five-industry high-yield network" of the Feiyue Commune in LÃ¼liang County includes 4,500 mu of cultivated land, 1,000 mu of low mounds, shallow ditches, and gentle slopes, and 2,500 mu of barren mountains and slopes. They built the cultivated land into 45 hundred-mu squares, divided into eight planting areas. Timber forests were built on the gentle slopes of low mounds and shallow ditches, and agricultural (feed) and forest intercropping were implemented on the fruit tree and timber forest bases; cave dwellings were built in layers on the field heads and ditch cliffs, and field cattle, sheep, and pig pens were established to implement remote land near planting, and on-site accumulation and application of fertilizer; and 10,000-fish ponds and 100-duck ponds were built by using ditch-side reservoirs. This achieves taking grain as the key link, developing all five industries simultaneously, promoting each other, feeding animal husbandry with agriculture, promoting agriculture with animal husbandry, protecting agriculture with forestry, and promoting forestry with agriculture, and comprehensive utilization.
		The new square field also promotes the development of agricultural science and technology and changes people's mental outlook. Various places have universally established small farm scientific experimental fields, technical research guidance rooms, crop archive record rooms, and meteorological observation stations with 10,000-mu cultivation areas as units, implementing science and technology to the fields, combining cadres, technicians, and the masses, and promoting the mass practice of science. The professional teams in the square are both production team members and scientific and technological research personnel, and they learn from each other, teach each other, learn while doing. This effectively promotes the development of agricultural science and technology and the rapid growth of the agricultural science and technology team. With technology entering the square, culture also entered the square, and field clubs, reading rooms, poetry competition stages, broadcasting, etc. were established one after another. At the same time, living welfare and militia training also entered the square, and simple field rest rooms, health stations, canteens, and mobile supply vehicles for daily necessities were established. This further enriched the construction of the new square field, making the commune members more happy and convenient in laboring and living in the square field.
		At the same time, since cadres uniformly dispatch and direct production on 10,000-mu square fields, cadres have rapidly increased their ability to lead the collective large-scale production of the people's commune. Since the masses of farmers collectively labor, entertain, learn, and live on 10,000-mu fields, the masses of farmers have rapidly strengthened the organization, discipline, and habits of large-scale collective production. Since it is necessary to work together, act in unison, and cooperate with each other in 10,000-mu square fields, this further trains and improves the communist ideological consciousness of cadres and the masses.
		Practice since the Great Leap Forward has proved that the policy of implementing multiple planting and multiple harvesting and high-yield and multiple harvesting "walking on two legs" is the correct way to increase grain production. The farming system combining small farm experimental fields, large-area high-yield fields, and general fields is a concrete method for implementing the policy of multiple planting and multiple harvesting and high-yield and multiple harvesting. Now, in the movement to build new socialist square fields, the broad masses have created the "four-field combination" farming system and the "four-unified and three-divided" management method, which have replaced the "three-field" combination farming system and solved the contradiction between the unified management of square fields and the people's commune's implementation of the three-level ownership system based on the team.
		The so-called "four fields": one refers to the command field, that is, the establishment of small farm scientific experimental fields in the cultivation area, and various production increase measures are first tested in the experimental field to gain experience and then promoted throughout the square, which is the command field of the cultivation area; the second is the high-standard square field accounting for 30% to 50% of the square field area, also called the central square or model field, which implements high-standard cultivation management and takes the first step in mechanization to accelerate the realization of the targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program; the third is the general square field accounting for 50% to 70% of the square field area, which realizes large-area high yield through farmland revolution and intensive cultivation management; and the fourth is the scattered small plots of land for planting feed and vegetables in the square field, which is the supplementary field. This contact system from the command field to the square field is a relatively scientific and complete farmland production system suitable for the current stage.
		The so-called "four unifications and three divisions": in the 10,000-mu cultivation area, implement unified leadership and command, unified planning, unified management standards, and unified crop archive records; the original communes and districts each operate, each accounting, and each bears its own profits and losses. This makes the cultivation area the basic unit for the people's commune to direct agricultural production, and the hundred-mu square the basic unit for crop management. This method of unified leadership of production by communes or communities, and investment and labor and profit distribution still according to the three-level ownership system based on the team, not only adheres to the principle of the three-level ownership system of the people's commune based on the team (management area), but also gives full play to the huge advantages of the people's commune's "large and public" in the organization and leadership of production and management.
		"Four-field combination" and "four-unified and three-divided" are concrete applications of the policy of "walking on two legs" of multiple planting and multiple harvesting and high-yield and multiple harvesting. In this way, it not only ensures the rapid development of current agricultural production, but also facilitates the gradual realization of the ideal of making the land a garden, continues to adhere to the principle of the three-level ownership system of the people's commune based on the team, and gives full play to the powerful advantages of the people's commune in developing production. This is a great creation of the broad masses under the leadership of the Party.
