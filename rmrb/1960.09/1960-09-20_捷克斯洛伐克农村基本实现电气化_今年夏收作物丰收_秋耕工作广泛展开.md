Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 19th: Czechoslovakia's plan to electrify all of its fourteen thousand two hundred and thirty-three villages has been completed four months ahead of schedule, in early September.

    This plan was adopted at the Czechoslovak Communist Party National Congress held in June 1956. The plan was originally scheduled for completion by the end of this year, but thanks to the efforts of the working people, on September 4th, the last village in the plan, Zlata Baňa in East Slovakia, received its power supply ahead of schedule.

    As of now, 99% of the country's residents—thirteen million five hundred and eighty-one thousand people—are able to use electricity. The remaining 1% of residents living in remote areas will receive electricity during the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965).

    Since liberation, Czechoslovakia's electricity industry has developed rapidly. Between 1948 and 1959, various power stations with a total generating capacity of 2.6 million kilowatts were put into operation nationwide. In 1958, Czechoslovakia's per capita electricity production reached 1,456 kilowatt-hours, making the country one of the nations with the highest level of electricity supply in the world.

    By 1965, Czechoslovakia's per capita electricity production will reach approximately 3,000 kilowatt-hours, surpassing all capitalist countries except the United States.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 17th: Czechoslovakia's summer harvest crops are showing a scene of abundance this year.

    The grain procurement plan was completed two weeks ahead of schedule, on September 13th. The hop harvesting is complete, with an average yield of 850 kilograms per hectare, an increase of 6.3% over last year. 31% of silage corn has been harvested, with an average yield of about 300 to 350 quintals per hectare, and high-yield areas reaching 600 quintals per hectare. This year's sugar beet yield is over 300 quintals per hectare, the highest yield in the post-war years.

    Due to the increase in yield per unit area and the expansion of planting area, the total output of many crops has greatly increased compared to last year. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Resources, the total output of silage corn is expected to increase by one-third compared to last year, the total output of sugar beets will increase by one-third compared to last year, and the total output of hops will be 15% higher than last year.

    The main reason for this year's abundant summer harvest is the farmers' intensive cultivation. The spring sowing of grain crops started early this year and was completed within seven to ten days. The area using chemical herbicides this year reached 500,000 hectares, an increase of 35% compared to last year. Half of the corn planting area was converted to square planting. The sowing and inter-row cultivation of sugar beets were carried out in a timely manner, and chemical pesticides were used to eliminate pests that eat the beet hearts.

    The harsh weather conditions during this year's summer harvest were unprecedented in decades, but thanks to the efforts of the farmers and the enthusiastic support of factories, enterprises, government agencies, and schools in various regions, the harvesting work was completed in a timely manner.

    Industrial support for agriculture has enabled a large amount of harvesting work in rural areas to be completed quickly using machinery. This year, 14% of the hop harvesting was done by machines, doubling the degree of mechanization of hop harvesting compared to last year. The number of corn combine harvesters has also increased by 1,500 compared to last year. This year's sugar beet harvesting was the first time to be harvested by 920 Czechoslovak-made sugar beet combine harvesters.

    Simultaneous with the summer harvest, autumn plowing work has also begun throughout Czechoslovakia. In order to obtain a bountiful autumn harvest, cooperatives and state farms in various regions are ensuring that autumn plowing is completed within seven to ten days. The degree of agricultural mechanization guarantees that this year's autumn plowing work can be 100% mechanized.

### 捷克斯洛伐克农村基本实现电气化  今年夏收作物丰收　秋耕工作广泛展开

    捷克斯洛伐克农村基本实现电气化
    今年夏收作物丰收　秋耕工作广泛展开
    新华社布拉格19日电　捷克斯洛伐克全国一万四千二百三十三个乡村实现电气化的计划已经在9月初提前四个月完成。
    这个计划是在1956年6月举行的捷克斯洛伐克共产党全国代表会议上通过的。计划原订在今年年底实现，但是由于劳动人民的努力，在9月4日那一天，计划中的最后一个村庄——东斯洛伐克的兹拉塔巴村就提前得到了电力供应。
    截至目前为止，全国99％的居民——一千三百五十八万一千人已能够使用电力。其余1％生活在边远偏僻地区的居民将在第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）期间得到电力供应。
    解放以来，捷克斯洛伐克的电力工业获得了迅速的发展。在1948年到1959年期间，全国有发电能力共为二百六十万瓩的各种电力站投入生产。在1958年，捷克斯洛伐克按人口平均计算的电力产量已经达到一千四百五十六度，从而使这个国家成为世界上电力供应水平最高的国家之一。
    到1965年，捷克斯洛伐克按人口平均计算的电力产量将达到三千度左右，这样，它将超过除美国以外的一切资本主义国家。
    新华社布拉格17日电　捷克斯洛伐克今年夏收作物呈现一片丰收景象。
    谷物收购计划已提前两周，在9月13日完成。啤酒花的采集工作已告结束，每公顷平均产量达八百五十公斤，比去年增加6.3％。青贮玉蜀黍已有31％收割完毕，每公顷平均产量约达三百到三百五十公担，高产地有达每公顷六百公担的。今年甜菜产量每公顷在三百公担以上，为战后年代的最高产量。
    由于单位面积产量的提高和种植面积的扩大，很多农作物的总产量比去年大大增多。据农林和水利部预计，青贮玉蜀黍总产量将比去年提高三分之一，甜菜的总产量将比去年提高三分之一，啤酒花的总产量将比去年高15％。
    今年夏收作物丰收的原因主要是由于农民的精耕细作。今年谷物的春播工作开始得早，且在七到十天内完成了播种。今年利用化学药品除草的面积达五十万公顷，比去年增多了35％。玉蜀黍种植面积的一半改用了方形播种法。甜菜的播种、间行工作都进行得及时，并且用化学药品除掉了吃菜心的害虫。
    今年夏收时节气候条件的恶劣，是几十年来所没有的，但是由于农民的努力，各地工厂、企业、机关和学校的热情支援，收割工作还是及时完成了。
    工业对农业的支援，使农村中大量的收割工作可以利用机器迅速地完成。今年啤酒花的采集工作有14％是用机器来完成的，啤酒花采集工作的机械化程度比去年提高了一倍。玉蜀黍联合收割机也比去年增加了一千五百架。今年的甜菜收割工作是第一次用捷克斯洛伐克自制的九百二十架甜菜联合收割机收割的。
    与夏收同时，秋耕工作也已在捷克斯洛伐克全国开始。为了获得秋季作物的丰收，各地合作社和国营农场保证在七到十天内完成秋耕。农业机械化的程度保证了今年的秋耕工作能百分之百使用机械。
