Xinhua News Agency, September 21st, New York Dispatch: The fifteenth session of the United Nations General Assembly opened in New York on the afternoon of September 20th (New York time).

　　Delegations from more than eighty member states of the United Nations are participating in this session of the General Assembly. Many countries have sent delegations led by heads of government to attend this session of the General Assembly. These include Soviet Premier Khrushchev and the heads of government of some Eastern European socialist countries, and Cuban Prime Minister Castro. Tito of Yugoslavia also attended the General Assembly.

　　Some heads of state or government have also announced their intention to attend the General Assembly.

　　After a brief opening speech by Belaunde (Peru), the President of the Fourteenth UN General Assembly, the meeting approved Belaunde's proposal on the composition of the Credentials Committee for the Fifteenth UN General Assembly and elected Frederick Boland, the representative of Ireland, as the President of the Fifteenth UN General Assembly.

　　The General Assembly then discussed the issue of admitting new member states. Fourteen countries were approved as new member states of the United Nations: Cameroon, Togo, Madagascar, the Republic of the Congo (formerly the Belgian Congo), the Republic of the Congo (formerly the French Congo), Dahomey, Niger, Upper Volta, Somalia, Chad, Ivory Coast, the Central African Republic, Gabon, and Cyprus. Thirteen of these fourteen countries are African countries. This increases the number of UN member states from the past eighty-two to ninety-six.

　　When the meeting approved the admission of the Republic of the Congo (formerly the Belgian Congo) as a member state, it decided, based on the suggestion of the President of the General Assembly, to refer the issue of the representation of the Republic of the Congo at the meeting to the Credentials Committee for discussion, even though the delegation dispatched by the legitimate government of the Congo—the Lumumba government—had already arrived in New York to attend the meeting.

　　Because Senegal announced its withdrawal from the Mali Federation, causing the federation to split, the meeting decided to postpone the discussion of admitting the Mali Federation as a member state.

　　After admitting the new member states, representatives of various countries spoke in succession to congratulate the new member states.

　　Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko said that the Soviet government believes that the United Nations' admission of fourteen new member states is a major event. He emphasized that all these countries have experienced difficult periods of colonial oppression and have just shaken off this colonial oppression. However, the colonialists are still trying to replace the old colonial rule with new colonial rule in order to continue exploiting these new countries.

　　The head of the Czechoslovak delegation, President Novotny of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, representing the delegations of other Eastern European socialist countries, welcomed the newly independent countries, especially the countries of the African continent, to join the United Nations. He assured that the socialist countries are prepared to conduct the most sincere cooperation to promote the economic, cultural, and social development of the newly independent countries. Shukairy, the head of the Saudi Arabian delegation, spoke at the meeting, welcoming the new member states, saying that these newly independent countries are joining the United Nations with wounds, blood, and tears. He hoped that these countries would unite with their African and Asian counterparts in the struggle to strive for active neutrality, not participate in military blocs, and realize the principles of the Bandung Conference. Shukairy then said that the entire Africa should be a free Africa, and all colonialists should withdraw from the African continent and return the wealth of Africa to the African people.

　　Representatives of the colonialist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France also hypocritically expressed "congratulations" to these new countries. They shamelessly promoted that their governments are "loved" by the people of the former colonies and are prepared to continue "cooperating" with these countries.

　　Many other representatives also spoke at the meeting.

　　When the Chiang Kai-shek elements spoke, Khrushchev, the head of the Soviet delegation, and representatives of other socialist countries all left the meeting.

　　The first day of the fifteenth UN General Assembly concluded after the representative of Spain spoke. The General Assembly will continue to meet on the morning of September 21st (New York time) to elect the chairmen of the various working committees and the vice-presidents of the General Assembly.

　　联合国大会第十五届会议开幕
　  批准喀麦隆多哥等十四个新会员国
    新华社21日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会第十五届会议在纽约时间20日下午开幕。
    参加这届大会的有联合国八十多个会员国的代表团。许多国家派遣了由政府首脑率领的代表团出席本届大会。其中有苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和东欧一些社会主义国家政府首脑、古巴总理卡斯特罗等。南斯拉夫的铁托也出席了大会。
    还有一些国家的元首或政府首脑已宣布要出席大会。
    在第十四届联大会议主席贝朗德（秘鲁）致简短的开幕词后，会议通过了贝朗德提出的关于第十五届联大会议的全权证书委员会的组成，并且选出爱尔兰代表博兰为第十五届联大会议主席。
    大会接着讨论接纳新会员国问题。被批准为联合国新会员国的有十四个国家，它们是：喀麦隆、多哥、马尔加什、刚果共和国（前比属刚果）、刚果共和国（前法属刚果）、达荷美、尼日尔、上沃尔特、索马里、乍得、象牙海岸、中非共和国、加蓬和塞浦路斯。这十四个国家中有十三个是非洲国家。这使联合国成员国从过去的八十二个增加到九十六个。
    会议在通过接纳刚果共和国（前比属刚果）为会员国时根据大会主席的建议决定把刚果共和国代表出席会议的问题交给全权证书委员会讨论，虽然刚果的合法政府——卢蒙巴政府派遣的代表团早已到达纽约准备出席会议。
    由于塞内加尔宣布退出马里联邦而使联邦陷于分裂，会议决定延期讨论接纳马里联邦为会员国的问题。
    在接纳新会员国后，各国代表相继发言对新会员国表示祝贺。
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯说，苏联政府认为联合国接纳十四个新会员国是一个重大事件。他着重指出，所有这些国家都经历了殖民主义压迫的艰难时期，它们刚刚摆脱了这种殖民主义压迫。而殖民主义者们仍然在力图以新的殖民主义统治来代替旧的殖民统治，以继续剥削这些新的国家。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长、捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国总统诺沃提尼代表东欧其他社会主义国家代表团欢迎新独立国家，特别是非洲大陆的国家加入联合国。他保证，社会主义国家准备进行最忠诚的合作以促进新独立的国家经济、文化和社会的发展。沙特阿拉伯代表团团长舒凯里在会上讲话，欢迎新会员国，他说，这些新独立的国家是带着创伤、血和泪加入联合国的。他希望这些国家在争取积极中立、不参加军事集团和实现万隆会议原则的斗争中将同它们的非洲和亚洲的同伴联合在一起。舒凯里接着说，整个非洲应当是自由的非洲，一切殖民主义者应当退出非洲大陆，把非洲的财富交还给非洲人民。
    美、英、法等殖民主义国家代表也伪善地对这些新国家表示“祝贺”，他们无耻地宣传他们的政府受到前殖民地人民的“爱戴”，并且准备继续同这些国家“合作”。
    会上还有其他许多代表发言。
    当蒋介石分子讲话时，苏联代表团团长赫鲁晓夫以及其他社会主义国家代表都退出了会场。
    十五届联大第一天会议在西班牙代表发言以后宣布结束。大会将在纽约时间21日上午继续开会，选举各工作委员会主席和大会副主席。
