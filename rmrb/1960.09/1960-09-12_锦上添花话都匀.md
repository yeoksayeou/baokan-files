Adding Flowers to the Brocade: Talking about Duyun
	Guan Qizhong

    Duyun City, the capital of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, is a transportation hub in southern Guizhou and the political, economic, and cultural center of the entire prefecture. The Qian-Gui Railway runs through the city, and the Xiang-Qian Railway, currently under construction, will also connect with the Qian-Gui Railway here.

    This small town, dilapidated and with a population of only 10,000 ten years ago, is now a burgeoning industrial city with factories lining the streets, a neat city appearance, and a population of 120,000, becoming a base for promoting agricultural technology transformation in the Qiannan area. Its railway, machinery, electric power, and light chemical industries provide agriculture with an increasing number of new-style machines, fertilizers, and electricity.

    Before liberation, Duyun's industrial production was a "blank sheet of paper." The city only had a few scattered blacksmith shops and a small number of individual handicraft workers, with a total of just over 150 employees, who could only produce hoes and sickles of poor quality. General agricultural tools had to rely on supplies from other places. After liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the industry in the Duyun area has developed rapidly. In a short period, it established industrial foundations for iron and steel, machinery, coal, electric power, and light chemicals. The area of newly built factories and mines in the city is equal to one and a half times the total area of the city before liberation. The total industrial output value in 1959 increased by 200 times compared to 1949.

    The rapid development of industry has vigorously promoted the technological transformation of agriculture. The establishment of the iron and steel "small foreign groups," with the Duyun Iron and Steel Plant and Yangliujie Iron and Steel Plant as the backbone, ended the history of Qiannan area not producing steel and steel materials, and to a certain extent, met the needs of agricultural production for iron and steel. At the same time, the development of the machinery industry has provided agriculture with an increasing number of means of production, including many rice transplanters, new-style plows, and irrigation and drainage tools that had never been manufactured before.

    Under the slogan of "vigorously supporting agriculture," in recent months, the factories and mines in the Duyun area have launched a comprehensive and systematic upsurge of supporting agriculture. More than 70 factories and mines in the city have generally linked up with the people's communes in the suburbs through factory-commune collaboration, area-based contracting, and the establishment of satellite factories. Qiannan General Machinery Plant, Diesel Engine Plant, and Motor Plant have respectively helped eight communes in the Duyun area establish agricultural tool factories with metalworking, forging, fitting, and casting processes. Recently, the factories and mines in the city have trained 164 technicians for the communes. The tannery and waxed paper factory have also set up satellite workshops, using by-products to make more than ten kinds of chemical fertilizers such as ferrous sulfate and ammonium sulfate, which have strongly supported agricultural production.

    锦上添花话都匀	关启忠
    黔南布依族苗族自治州首府——都匀市，是贵州南部的交通枢纽，也是全州政治、经济、文化中心。黔桂铁路横贯市区，正在修建的湘黔铁路，也将在这里同黔桂路接轨。
    这个十年前破烂不堪、仅有一万人口的小市镇，现在已是工厂林立、市容整齐，拥有十二万人口的新兴工业城市，成为促进黔南地区农业技术改造的基地。这里的铁路、机械、电力、轻化工等工业，为农业提供了愈来愈多的新式机具、化肥和电力。
    解放前，都匀的工业生产是一张“白纸”。全市只有零零落落的几家铁匠铺和少数的个体手工业者，全部从业人员不过一百五十多人，只能生产质量较差的锄头和镰刀。一般农具都要依靠外地供应。解放后，特别是大跃进的1958年以来，都匀地区的工业得到了飞跃发展，在短短的时间内，即建立了钢铁、机械、煤炭、电力、轻化工等工业基础。全市新建厂矿的面积，等于解放前市区总面积的一倍半。工业总产值1959年比1949年增长二百倍。
    工业的迅速发展，有力地促进了农业的技术改造。以都匀钢铁厂和杨柳街钢铁厂为骨干的钢铁“小洋群”的建立，结束了黔南地区不产钢和钢材的历史，在一定程度上满足了农业生产对于钢铁的需要。同时，机械工业的发展，给农业提供了愈来愈多的生产资料。其中包括很多过去从未制造过的插秧机、新式犁耙和排灌工具。
    在“大力支援农业”的口号下，近几个月来，都匀地区的厂矿掀起了全面、系统地支援农业的高潮，市区的七十多个厂矿通过厂社挂钩，分片包干，办卫星厂等办法，普遍与郊区的人民公社挂了钩。黔南通用机械厂、柴油机械厂、电机厂分别帮助都匀地区的八个公社建立了拥有金工、锻工、钳工、铸造等工序的农具厂。最近一个时期，全市各厂矿即为公社培养了一百六十四名技术工人。制革厂、腊纸厂还设立了卫星车间，利用副产品制成硫酸铁、硫酸铵等十余种化肥，有力地支援了农业生产。（附图片）
