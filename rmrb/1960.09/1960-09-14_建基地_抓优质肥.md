    Building Bases, Seizing High-Quality Fertilizer
    The Shucheng Commune in Shuyang County, Jiangsu Province, has implemented the targets and measures for accumulating and producing base fertilizer for autumn planting, along with the autumn sowing plan, down to the teams and fields. This has further ignited a high tide of fertilizer accumulation by vigorously building fertilizer bases and seizing high-quality fertilizer.
    The commune's Party committee and the general brigade branches calculated the fertilizer accumulation tasks field by field, group by group, and team by team, formulating fertilizer accumulation, production, transportation, and utilization plans at each level. Simultaneously, they summarized the experiences of red-flag fertilizer accumulation brigades such as Sunxiang, Qianxiang, and Muna in establishing fertilizer bases, accumulating fertilizer year-round, and using fertilizer locally. They believed this was a powerful measure to solve the shortage of labor for fertilizer accumulation and transportation and to strengthen the planning of fertilizer accumulation and utilization. It was also well-suited to the commune's characteristics of having a large amount of land, many distant fields, and a small labor force. They mobilized all commune members to vigorously accumulate high-quality fertilizer and build fertilizer bases according to the fertilizer accumulation plan. In terms of establishing pig-raising and fertilizer accumulation bases: The commune's 163 collective pig farms and pigsties gradually implemented "four reforms" (shallow to deep, small to large, dry to wet, and shady to sunny) and "one attachment" (attaching a thousand-dan pig manure pond next to the pigsty). In one month, they have accumulated 140,000 dan of pig manure fertilizer. In terms of establishing green manure bases: 3,400 mu of green manure were planted in the summer, and 3,000 mu were interplanted using vacant land and "ten edges." They are currently growing well and will be turned into the soil before the sowing of the three wheat crops. In terms of establishing grass pond mud and compost/pile fertilizer bases: According to different crops and different soil qualities, requirements of five mu, ten mu, and twenty mu per pond were proposed respectively. Grass pond mud and compost ponds were vigorously developed, and 810 compost pits were built next to the cattle sheds. The compost is mostly piled on the edges of fields, villages, roads, and threshing grounds, using a method of layering mud, grass, and manure, watering each layer, and sealing the surroundings with mud. It can ferment in ten days, and the whole commune has already made 1.2 million dan of compost. In terms of establishing soil fertilizer factory bases: The commune's 82 large and small soil fertilizer factories have doubled their daily output after rectification and improvement. In terms of establishing fertilizer accumulation bases for commune member households: Each household has achieved one toilet, one ash storage, and one water manure pond next to the pigsty.

    建基地　抓优质肥
    江苏沭阳县沭城公社将秋种基肥的积肥、造肥的指标、措施和秋播计划一起落实到队到田，已进一步掀起了大建肥料基地、大抓优质肥料的积肥运动高潮。
    这个公社党委和各大队支部在逐田逐组逐队算积肥任务，层层制订积肥、造肥、运肥、用肥计划，同时，总结了孙巷、前巷、沐南等积肥红旗大队建立肥料基地、常年积肥、就地用肥的经验，认为这是解决积肥运肥劳力不足、加强积肥用肥的计划性的有力措施，也很适应本社地多、远田多、劳力少的特点，就动员全社社员按照积肥计划，大积优质肥料、大建肥料基地。在建立养猪积肥基地方面：全社一百六十三个社队猪场、猪圈逐步实行了“四改”（浅改深、小改大、干改湿、阴改阳），“一带”（猪圈旁带一个千担猪粪塘），一个月来已积猪粪肥十四万担。在建立绿肥基地方面：夏种绿肥三千四百亩，利用空隙地、“十边”套种三千亩，目前生长良好，准备三麦播种前翻入土中。在建立草塘泥和沤肥、堆肥基地方面：根据不同作物、不同土质分别提出五亩、十亩、二十亩一塘的要求，大搞草塘泥和沤肥塘，并在牛棚旁搞了沤肥汪八百一十个。堆肥大都搞在田边、庄边、路边、场边，采用一层泥、一层草、一层粪，层层浇水，四周用泥封闭的方法，十天可以发酵，全社已搞堆肥一百二十万担。在建立土化肥厂基地方面：全社八十二个大小土化肥厂经过整顿提高，日产量已翻了两倍。在建立社员家庭积肥基地方面：已做到每户有一个厕所、一个灰库，猪圈旁有一个水粪塘。
