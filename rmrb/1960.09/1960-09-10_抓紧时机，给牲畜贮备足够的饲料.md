    Seize the Time to Stock Enough Fodder for Livestock
    The time between late summer and early autumn, when plants and trees are lush, is an excellent season for planting fodder crops and collecting and storing wild fodder. Cadres and members of people's communes in all regions should pay close attention to this issue: stocking enough fodder for livestock. Agricultural areas should pay attention to this issue, and pastoral areas should pay even more attention. The annual haymaking season in pastoral areas is actually equivalent to the autumn harvest season in agricultural areas. Missing this season will put next year's animal husbandry work in a passive position; seizing this season will provide the most important material conditions for the development of animal husbandry in winter and next year.
    A very important task in developing animal husbandry is to stock enough fodder. In rural areas of our country, socialist collective raising has become the main mode of production for animal husbandry. A livestock farm raises dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of pigs, sheep, cattle, and horses. Without a large amount of fodder storage, it is impossible to adapt to the new situation of current collective raising. The experience of developing animal husbandry in the first half of this year proves that livestock farms with more than one month's fodder reserves, coupled with other conditions, breed livestock quickly and raise them well; without this, the number of livestock cannot steadily increase. Green and coarse fodder is widely available in large quantities and is the basic feed for livestock, as well as the main focus of our fodder storage.
    The production of green and coarse fodder is highly seasonal. Before the Beginning of Autumn, most fodder grass is in the middle of its growth stage, with high water content and low yield, making it difficult to store. After the Frost's Descent, the fodder has passed the milky stage, the stalks have hardened, and the nutrients have decreased. By winter, most areas of the country cannot collect wild fodder. From now until the Frost's Descent, there are still forty or fifty days. We must seize this best season to collect large amounts of hay and prepare silage. Some areas can also use scattered plots, fallow land, and water surfaces to plant a season of fast-growing fodder and aquatic fodder.
    The intense autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing are coming; this is the period of the year when animal power is used the most, and there must be sufficient fodder to raise all the draft animals well. The livestock mated in the spring and summer seasons will give birth to a large number of young livestock in late autumn and early winter; in the autumn and winter seasons of this year, a high tide of pig raising will be set off in various places. The fodder needed by piglets and young livestock must be prepared early. Therefore, whether from the perspective of the current needs of livestock and future development, or from the perspective of the growing season of fodder, people's communes in various places must arrange the necessary labor as much as possible to collect, plant, and store enough green and coarse fodder needed by livestock of all sizes from now until around May next year. Doing this work well is the key to the rapid development of animal husbandry next year and an important guarantee for the continuous leap forward in agriculture. Areas that have suffered more serious natural disasters should pay even more attention to this work and store enough fodder in order to preserve the vitality of animal husbandry and increase the ability to resist disasters and restore production.
    With the development of animal husbandry, the demand for fodder is increasing; with the overall leap forward in the national economy, the relationship between fodder production and other production undertakings is also becoming more complex. On the one hand, we must go all out, be full of confidence, and boldly open up fodder sources; on the other hand, we must be down-to-earth, realistic, and meticulously and carefully arrange fodder production. The breeding farms of people's communes, production brigades, and contracted units in various places should, based on the principle of balancing supply and demand and striving for surplus, carefully calculate the accurate and detailed accounts of the supply and demand of green and coarse fodder, trough by trough and head by head. There are many benefits to calculating detailed accounts: it is easy to improve the masses' understanding of the work of collecting and storing green and coarse fodder, so that everyone attaches importance to this work; it is easy to direct the collection and storage work, so that it is busy but not chaotic, fast but not rough, with a clear picture in mind, and with a combination of work and rest; it is also easy to formulate practical and effective collection and storage measures to successfully complete the collection and storage tasks. When calculating fodder, the exact amount needed should be calculated according to the number, size, and consumption quota of green and coarse fodder of various livestock to be developed this winter and next spring, as well as the consumption of green and coarse fodder in the process of harvesting, transporting, storing, and feeding. At the same time, calculate clearly the source, quantity, and storage period of various green and coarse fodder; such as how much wild fodder can be collected, how much straw and vines of various crops can be supplied, and how much can be supplied from fodder fields, etc. At present, wild fodder is very abundant and should be the focus of the collection and storage work. Crop stalks have a wide range of uses, some of which need to be comprehensively utilized, some of which are used as roofs and fences for some farmhouses and essential fuels, and some of which are used as fertilizers. A unified arrangement should be made, but the needs of livestock feed should be given priority. In short, when solving the fodder problem, we must not isolate ourselves and only see the needs of fodder, but proceed from all aspects of the local economic life, consider everything in an overall way, and make appropriate arrangements. After calculating a reliable supply and demand account, we can formulate practical and feasible measures, implement them at all levels, and take immediate action.
    There are hundreds of millions of livestock of various types in the country, requiring the collection and storage of trillions of catties of green and coarse fodder, which is a very large quantity, and the time is very tight. Counting from now, there are only sixty or seventy days, and at the same time, it will be linked to the intense autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting. Current agricultural activities are also very busy. Therefore, the collection, storage, and planting of green and coarse fodder should be placed together with other agricultural activities, and comprehensive arrangements should be made in combination with each other. We must be good at adopting different methods according to different times and different conditions. According to the experience of various places, roughly the following methods can be adopted: First, seize the gaps in agricultural affairs and carry out a mass movement of shock work. For example, Shanxi Province resolutely squeezed out ten days around the Limit of Heat (August 23) to carry out a mass movement of shock haymaking and green storage in the countryside; Second, combine inter-tillage and weeding and other agricultural activities, and adopt the method of "going to the field with hands not empty, and bringing back a basket," to widely mobilize commune members to participate in the work of collecting and storing green and coarse fodder, which can be promoted everywhere; Third, on the basis of strengthening political and ideological education, adopt the method of recording work points or cash purchases to mobilize auxiliary labor to make and store green grass. No matter what method is adopted, the key lies in strengthening leadership. Cadres of people's communes and production teams in various places should carefully consider: Is the fodder there sufficiently stored? Have you already taken action? What measures will be taken to solve the fodder problem? It is hoped that party organizations at all levels, especially the grass-roots party organizations of communes and production teams, will list the problem of solving the fodder and feed for livestock to survive the winter this year as one of the important contents of their work, and grasp the fodder in the same way as grasping food for a certain period of time, and resolutely ensure that there is sufficient fodder this winter and next spring. This is the key to promoting the rapid development of animal husbandry, and it is also a powerful measure to strengthen the agricultural production line and better solve the fertilizer and power problems urgently needed for increasing agricultural production.

    抓紧时机，给牲畜贮备足够的饲料
    夏秋之交草木繁茂，正是种植饲料作物和采集贮存野生饲料的大好季节。各地人民公社的干部和社员都应当密切注意这样一个问题：给牲畜贮备足够的饲料。农业区要注意这个问题，牧区更要注意这个问题。牧区一年一度的打草季节，实际上等于农业区的秋收季节，错过这个季节，就会使下一年的畜牧工作陷于被动地位；抓紧这个季节，冬季和下一年畜牧工作的发展就能够取得最重要的物质条件。
    发展畜牧业的一项很重要的工作就是贮备足够的饲料。在我国农村中，社会主义的集体饲养已成为畜牧业的主要生产方式。一个畜牧场养的猪羊牛马，少则几十头，多则几百头以至上千头。如果没有大量的饲料贮备，是不能适应当前集体饲养的新形势的。今年上半年发展畜牧业的经验证明：凡是有一个月以上的饲料贮备的畜牧场，加上其他条件的配合，家畜就繁殖得快，养得也好；如果没有这一条，家畜数量就不能稳步上升。青粗饲料来源广，数量大，是牲畜的基本饲料，也是我们贮备饲料的主要着眼点。
    青粗饲料的生产有极大的季节性。立秋以前，大部分饲草处在生长中期，含水较多，产量又低，不易贮存。霜降以后，饲料过了乳熟阶段，秸秆硬化，养分减少。到了冬季，全国大多数地区，就不能采集野生饲料。从目前到霜降还有四、五十天时间，我们必须抓紧这个最好的季节，大量采集干草和调制青贮饲料。一部分地区，还可以利用零星地、休耕地和水面，种一季速生饲料和水生饲料。
    紧张的秋收、秋耕、秋播将要来到；这是一年中使用畜力最多的时期，要有充足的饲料，把所有的役畜养好。今年春、夏两季配种的家畜，将在秋末冬初生养大批幼畜；在今年秋冬两季，各地又将掀起一个养猪的高潮。仔猪幼畜需要的饲料，都要及早准备。因此，无论就当前牲畜的需要和今后的发展来说，也无论就饲料的生长季节来说，各地人民公社都必须尽可能地安排必要的劳力，大量采集、种植和贮足从现在起到明年5月前后大小家畜所需要的青粗饲料。作好这项工作，是明年畜牧业迅速发展的关键，也是农业持续跃进的重要保证。遭受自然灾害比较严重的地区，更应重视这项工作，贮存足够的饲料，以便保住畜牧业的元气，增加抗灾和恢复生产的力量。
    随着畜牧业的发展，饲料的需要量越来越大；随着国民经济的全面跃进，饲料生产和其他生产事业的关系也越来越复杂。一方面，必须鼓足干劲，充满信心，大刀阔斧地开辟饲料来源；另方面，必须脚踏实地，实事求是，细致地周密地安排饲料生产。各地人民公社、生产大队和包产单位的饲养场，都要根据供需平衡而且力求有余的原则，逐槽逐头地认真计算青粗饲料供应和需要的精确细账。算细账的好处很多：便于提高群众对采集、贮存青粗饲料工作的认识，使人人重视这项工作；便于指挥收贮工作，作到忙而不乱，快而不粗，心中有数，劳逸结合；也便于制订切实有效的收贮措施，出色地完成收贮任务。计算饲料时应当按照各种家畜今冬明春发展头数的多少、大小和它们的青粗饲料消费定额，以及青粗饲料在收割、运输、贮存、喂养过程中的消耗等，算出确切的需要量。同时，计算清楚各种青粗饲料的来源、数量以及收贮时期；如采集野生饲料有多少，各种农作物的秸秆荚蔓可以供应多少，饲料地里的生产又能供应多少等等。当前野生饲料很丰富，应作为收贮工作的重点。农作物秸秆的用途很广，有的要综合利用，有的要作农家一部分房舍的屋顶、篱笆以及必不可少的燃料，还有的要作肥料，应当统一安排，但要首先照顾到牲畜饲草的需要。总之，解决饲料问题时，不可孤立地只看到饲料一方面的需要，而要从当地各方面的经济生活出发，通盘考虑，安排适当。在算好可靠的供需账后，就可以拟定切实可行的措施，层层落实，立即行动。
    全国各种家畜有好几亿头，需要收贮几千亿斤青粗饲料，数量十分庞大，而时间又很紧迫。从现在算起，只有六、七十天的时间，同时，又将和紧张的秋收、秋耕、秋种连在一起。当前的农事活动，也十分繁忙。因此，青粗饲料的收贮和种植工作要同其他农事活动放在一起，全面安排，互相结合。要善于根据不同的时间和不同的条件采取各种不同的办法。根据各地的经验，大体上可以采取以下几种办法：第一，抓紧农事间隙，开展突击性的群众运动。例如山西省就在处暑（8月23日）前后，坚决挤出十天时间，在农村开展了一次突击打草贮青的群众运动；第二，结合中耕锄草以及其他农事活动，采取“下地不空手，回来带一筐”的办法，广泛发动社员参加采集和收贮青粗饲料的工作，这是各地都可以推行的；第三，在加强政治思想教育的基础上，采取记工分或现金收购办法，动员辅助劳力打贮青草。不论采取何种办法，关键在于加强领导。各地人民公社和生产队的干部，都应该认真考虑一下：你们那里的饲料究竟贮备充足了没有？是不是已经行动起来？将采取怎样的措施来解决饲料问题？希望各级党组织特别是公社和生产队的基层党组织，都把解决今年牲畜过冬的饲料饲草问题列为自己工作的重要内容之一，在一定时期内要像抓粮食一样地抓饲料，坚决保证今冬明春有充足的饲料。这是促进畜牧业迅速发展的关键，也是加强农业生产战线、更好地解决农业增产所迫切需要的肥料和动力问题的一项有力措施。
