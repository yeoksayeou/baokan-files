Xinhua News Agency, 21st: Joint Statement of the National Committee of the Chinese Machinery Trade Union and the United Kingdom of Boiler Makers, Shipbuilders and Structural Workers' Union

At the invitation of the National Committee of the Chinese Machinery Trade Union (hereinafter referred to as the Chinese Machinery Trade Union), a delegation from the United Kingdom of Boiler Makers, Shipbuilders and Structural Workers' Union (hereinafter referred to as the British Boiler Workers' Union) headed by John Hepplewhite visited the People's Republic of China in September 1960. During the visit, representatives of the Chinese Machinery Trade Union and representatives of the British Boiler Workers' Union held friendly talks and agreed to issue the following joint statement:

I
    The British Boiler Workers' Union thanked the Chinese Machinery Trade Union for the warm reception of the delegation. During its visit to Beijing, Harbin, Changchun, Anshan, Shenyang, Shanghai, and Wuxi, the delegation visited boiler factories, shipyards, construction sites, people's communes, schools, hospitals, and other workers' welfare facilities, and had friendly talks with many Chinese workers. The delegation recognized that the Chinese people, in the short period since liberation, have been dedicated to the task of building a socialist China and have made great progress in developing socialist industry and agriculture, thereby achieving remarkable results in improving the material and cultural living standards of the people, which is reflected in the obviously happy expressions of the Chinese people. It is firmly believed that the socialist construction of the Chinese people will continue to develop at a high speed. The delegation also unanimously recognized that while the Chinese people are engaged in selfless labor in building socialism, they hold a warm desire for peace, and their hospitality is unparalleled in other parts of the world. The delegation truly recognized the sincere desire of the Chinese people to develop and maintain friendly relations forever with all the people of the world, including the American people. The British Boiler Workers' Union fully agrees with the above views of the delegation. The Chinese Machinery Trade Union thanked the British Boiler Workers' Union for their enthusiastic encouragement and just support for the Chinese people.

II
    Chinese machinery workers resolutely support the British boiler workers in their struggle against American military bases and missile bases in Britain and West Germany; support their struggle to ban the testing, manufacturing, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons, and oppose all flights of American aircraft carrying nuclear weapons over British territory; support their struggle to ease international tensions, and support their condemnation of provocative American spy plane flights. Support their opposition to the rearmament of West Germany. Chinese machinery workers welcome the British workers' active activities to abolish all trade embargoes and unremittingly strive to expand East-West trade; support their efforts to improve living conditions and defend trade union rights. It is believed that these struggles will win the sympathy and support of workers and people all over the world and contribute to the defense of world peace.
    The British Boiler Workers' Union recognizes that the sole legal representation of the Chinese people in the United Nations belongs to the People's Republic of China. It further supports the view that the Chiang Kai-shek clique, supported by the U.S. government, has long occupied China's legal seat in the United Nations in violation of the United Nations Charter and the interests of world peace. It demands the immediate restoration of the legal seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. It believes that Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and all American military, political, and economic aggression forces must withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait; it believes that the liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair, and the British Boiler Workers' Union fully supports the Chinese people's claim to exercise all sovereignty over Taiwan - as an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The Chinese Machinery Trade Union thanks the British Boiler Workers' Union for their just support for the Chinese people. Both sides agree that the Chinese machinery workers and the British boiler workers, based on their mutual support in their common struggle, will further develop their friendship and contribute to lasting world peace.

III
    Both sides agree that the desire of all oppressed nations for national independence is just and must be respected. We firmly support the struggle of the people of Congo, Cuba, Algeria, and Asian, African, and Latin American countries to win and maintain national independence; and believe that the growing national independence movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is an important part of maintaining world peace.

IV
    Both sides are pleased to point out that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the friendship between the workers and people of China and Britain has developed significantly. This successful visit to China by the delegation of the British Boiler Workers' Union, especially the signing of this joint statement by the Chinese Machinery Trade Union and the British Boiler Workers' Union, has further strengthened the friendly cooperation between the machinery workers and their trade unions of China and Britain. Both sides agree that the strengthening of this friendly relationship will provide better conditions for economic and cultural exchanges between China and Britain. This is fully in line with the interests and common aspirations of the workers and people of China and Britain, and is also conducive to world peace; the Chinese Machinery Trade Union and the British Boiler Workers' Union will continue to develop friendly exchanges with each other and work together for the friendship between the workers of China and Britain.

　　中国机械工会和英国锅炉工会联合声明
    新华社21日讯　中国机械工会全国委员会和联合王国锅炉制造、造船和结构工人联合协会联合声明
    以约翰·赫波怀德为首的联合王国锅炉制造、造船和结构工人联合协会（以下简称英国锅炉工会）代表团应中国机械工会全国委员会（以下简称中国机械工会）的邀请，于1960年9月访问了中华人民共和国。在访问期间，中国机械工会的代表和英国锅炉工会的代表进行了友好的会谈，并同意发表如下的联合声明：一
    英国锅炉工会感谢中国机械工会对代表团的热诚接待。代表团在访问北京、哈尔滨、长春、鞍山、沈阳、上海、无锡期间，参观了锅炉、造船等工厂、建筑工地、人民公社、学校、医院和其他工人福利设施，和许多中国工人进行了友好谈话。代表团认识到：中国人民在解放以来的短暂时期内，致力于建设一个社会主义的中国的任务，已经在发展社会主义工业和农业方面获得巨大的进展，从而在提高人民的物质和文化生活水平方面获得了显著的成果，这一点在中国人民显然的愉快表情中反映了出来。深信中国人民的社会主义建设将继续高速度发展。代表团并一致认识到：中国人民从事于建设社会主义的忘我劳动时，对和平抱着热烈的愿望，他们的殷勤好客是世界其它各地所不能比拟的。代表团真正认识到：中国人民愿意永远和全世界所有的人民，包括美国人民在内，发展和保持友好关系的真诚愿望。英国锅炉工会完全同意代表团的上述观点。中国机械工会感谢英国锅炉工会对中国人民的热情鼓舞和正义支持。二
    中国机械工人坚决支持英国锅炉工人反对美国在英国和西德的军事基地和导弹基地的斗争；支持他们争取禁止试验、制造、储存和使用核武器，反对载有核武器的美国飞机在英国领土上的一切飞行的斗争；支持他们争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争，并支持他们对挑衅性的美国间谍飞机飞行的谴责。支持他们反对西德的重新武装。中国机械工人欢迎英国工人关于取消一切贸易禁运并不懈地争取扩大东西方贸易的积极活动；支持他们争取改善生活条件和保卫工会权利的努力。并相信，这些斗争将获得全世界工人和人民的同情和支持，为保卫世界和平作出贡献。
    英国锅炉工会认识到：中国人民在联合国中的唯一合法代表权是属于中华人民共和国的。它进一步支持这种观点：美国政府支持下的蒋介石集团长期霸占着中国在联合国中的合法席位是违背了联合国宪章和世界和平利益的。它要求立刻恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位。它认为：台湾是中国的领土不可分割的一部分，一切美国的军事、政治和经济侵略势力必须撤出台湾和台湾海峡；它认为解放台湾是中国的内政，英国锅炉工会完全支持中国人民对台湾——作为中国领土不可分割的一部分行使一切主权的要求。中国机械工会感谢英国锅炉工会对中国人民的正义支持。双方一致认为：中国机械工人和英国锅炉工人基于他们共同斗争中的相互支持，将进一步发展相互之间的友谊，并为持久的世界和平作出贡献。三
    双方一致认为：一切被压迫民族要求民族独立的愿望是正义的，并且必须受到尊重。我们坚决支持刚果、古巴、阿尔及利亚，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民争取与维护民族独立的斗争；并认为亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲日益发展的民族独立运动是维护世界和平的一个重要部分。四
    双方满意地指出：自从中华人民共和国成立以来，中英两国工人和人民之间的友谊有了显著的发展。英国锅炉工会代表团这一次在中国的成功的访问，特别是中国机械工会与英国锅炉工会这一联合声明的签订，已进一步加强了中英两国机械工人及其工会之间的友好合作。双方一致认为：这种友好关系的加强将为中英两国之间的经济和文化交流提供更好的条件。这是完全符合中英两国工人和人民的利益和共同愿望的，也是有利于世界和平的；中国机械工会和英国锅炉工会将继续发展相互之间的友好往来，为中英两国工人的友谊而共同努力。
