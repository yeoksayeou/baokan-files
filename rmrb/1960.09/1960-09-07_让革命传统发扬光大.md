In the years of revolutionary war, the people's army fought bravely against the enemy with guns in one hand and carried out large-scale production movements with hoes in the other. They were both combat teams and production teams, overcoming countless difficulties with the spirit of hard struggle, and moving from victory to victory. The three photos here show the scenes of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army carrying out large-scale production movements in those years. (Attached pictures)

    让革命传统发扬光大
    在革命战争的年代里，人民的军队一手拿枪英勇地打击敌人，一手拿锄头开展大生产运动，他们既是战斗队，又是生产队，以艰苦奋斗的精神，克服了无数困难，从胜利走向胜利。这里的三张照片，就是当年八路军和新四军开展大生产运动的情景。（附图片）
