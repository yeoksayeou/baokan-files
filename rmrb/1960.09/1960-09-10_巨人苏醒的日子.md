    For the U.S. imperialists who have made aggression and conspiracy their national policy, for those gentlemen who have made the use of big sticks and voting machines an instinct, the "Declaration of Havana" cannot but be a warning bell.
    And for the people of the three oceans and seven continents who have achieved independence, liberation, or are striving for independence and liberation, this declaration is another triumphant song of joy. It is so full of righteousness and vigor, shaking the world. It has aroused universal enthusiastic cheers in the socialist camp, won sympathy and admiration in the slums of Paris and Rome, and in the jungles of Black Africa, in the deserts of Arabia, in the orchards and mines of Latin America, on the vast lands marked with the boundaries of feudal lords and orchard owners, it is inspiring the oppressed and enslaved people, igniting the raging fire in their hands, beating the thundering war drums, and conducting a valiant struggle against imperialism and colonialism.
    "Today, in the struggle for a liberated Latin America, in the face of the subservience of those who have usurped official representation, the true voice of the people resonates with irresistible force, this voice comes from the depths of its coal and tin mines, from its factories and sugar mills, from its lands subjected to feudal rule. There, the Rotocholos, the Gauchos, the Jivaros—the successors of Zapata and Sandino—have taken up the weapons of freedom. This call echoes in their poetry and novels, and resonates in the hearts of their students, women, children, and their sleepless old people." (The Declaration of Havana)
    This voice that "resonates with irresistible force" is not only in Cuba, in Latin America; but also in Asia and Africa, in the National Diet square in Tokyo, on the streets of Seoul and Busan, at the airport in Leopoldville, on the banks of the Euphrates, Tigris, Congo, Niger and Bisi rivers, and in the skies over the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, rumbling and shaking. It has become a declaration denouncing imperialism and colonialism, and a bugle call for the advance of the people's revolutionary ranks.
    Regarding the "Declaration of Havana," although the U.S. State Department still pretends to be "not surprised," their spokesmen cannot help but exclaim that "this is a huge setback for the United States." How can it not be a "huge setback"? The era when only the gentlemen were allowed to have "declarations" and the oppressed people were not allowed to speak has ended; the days when only officials were allowed to set fires while the common people were not allowed to light lamps have ended!
    Marxists have always held the liberation struggles of the colonial and semi-colonial people in high regard and with close concern. They always support and eulogize the storms of national democratic movements that erupt in every corner of the world; they always open their arms to welcome the brothers who have broken free from their shackles and proudly stepped onto the political stage, and join them in the great cause of transforming this world.
    The great revolutionary teacher Lenin, in 1922, proclaimed with a loud voice and with foresight: "The tomorrow of world history will be such a day. At that time, the various nations that have been awakened and oppressed by imperialism will completely awaken, and their long and arduous decisive battle for their own liberation will begin." (Collected Works of Lenin, Vol. 36, p. 634)
    The day that Lenin predicted thirty-eight years ago has arrived. In the vast regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, hundreds of millions of slaves have already or are in the process of "awakening." When slaves awaken and stand up, they will turn into giants. Even if they only have spears and machetes in their hands, they will fight to the end against the rulers riding on their heads.
    Don't believe it?
    Listen to the war drums of Black Africa!
    Read the "Declaration of Havana"!

    巨人苏醒的日子
    梁汝怀
    对于把侵略和阴谋定为自己国策的美帝国主义者来说，对于那些使用大棒和表决机器已经成为一种本能的老爷们来说，《哈瓦那宣言》不能不是一声警钟。
    而对于三大洋七大洲已经取得独立、解放或正在争取独立、解放的人们来说，这个宣言是又一首欢乐的凯歌。它是那样正气磅礴，叱咤风云。它在社会主义阵营引起了普遍的热烈欢呼，在巴黎和罗马的贫民区里赢得了同情和羡慕，它在黑非洲的丛林里，在阿拉伯的沙漠里，在拉丁美洲的果园和矿井里，在辽阔的插上了封建主和果园主界牌的土地上，鼓舞着被压迫被奴役的人们，燃起人们手里的熊熊烈火，擂起咚咚战鼓，向帝国主义、殖民主义进行勇猛的战斗。
    “今天，在争取一个解放的拉丁美洲的斗争中，面对那些篡夺了官方代表权的人们的唯唯诺诺，真正的人民的声音以不可抗拒的声势震响着，这种声音来自它的煤矿和锡矿的内部，来自它的工厂和制糖厂，来自它的遭受封建统治的土地。在那里，罗托丘洛人、高丘人、希瓦罗人—萨帕塔和桑地诺的后继者们拿起了自由的武器。这种呼声在他们的诗歌里和小说里回响着，在他们的学生、妇女、孩子和他们的未能安眠的老人的心中共鸣着。”（《哈瓦那宣言》）
    这种“以不可抗拒的声势震响着”的声音，不只是在古巴，在拉丁美洲；也在亚洲和非洲，在东京的国会广场，在汉城和釜山的大街上，在利奥波德维尔的飞机场上，在幼发拉底斯河、底格里斯河、刚果河、尼日尔河和比西河的两岸，在太平洋、大西洋、印度洋的上空，隆隆地震响着。它成为声讨帝国主义、殖民主义的檄文，成为人民革命队伍进军的号角。
    对《哈瓦那宣言》，虽然美国国务院还装起样子，“表明他们并不感到惊讶”，但是他们的代言人已经不能不惊呼“这对美国说来是一个巨大挫折”。这怎么能不是“巨大的挫折”呢？只许老爷们有“宣言”、不许被压迫人民发出声音的时代从此结束了；只许州官放火、不许百姓点灯的日子结束了！
    马克思主义者从来都是对殖民地半殖民地人民的解放斗争寄以崇高的估价和密切的关怀的。对于世界上每一角落里所爆发的民族民主运动风暴，总是用全力支持和歌颂的；对于挣脱了枷锁、昂首走上政治舞台的兄弟们，总是张开两臂，迎接他们，并且同他们一起进行改造这个世界的宏伟事业的。
    伟大的革命导师列宁，在1922年，就以响亮的声音，高瞻远瞩地宣告：“世界史上的明天，将是这样的一个日子。那时已经被唤醒的、受帝国主义压迫的各民族就要完全苏醒过来，他们争取自己解放的长期的艰苦的决战就要开始了。”（《列宁全集》第36卷634页）
    列宁在三十八年前所预言的这个日子已经到来了。在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲广大的地区，亿万奴隶已经或者正在“苏醒过来”。奴隶们苏醒了，站起身来，就会变成巨人。即使他们手里只有梭镖，只有砍刀，他们也是要同骑在头上的统治者斗争到底的。
    不信么？
    请听一听黑非洲的战鼓！
    请读一读《哈瓦那宣言》！
