　　Lofty aspirations born from empty hands,
　　Sweeping away a thousand difficulties.
　　Creating miracles on March Mountain,
　　Turning barren hills into granaries.
　　On March Mountain in Guzhang County, Hunan, there are five ridges and fourteen bends. Every ridge has slopes, and every bend has terraced fields. Thousands of mu of corn are green and lush, and sunflowers are dotted with golden edges; citrus, oranges, pines, and firs sprout new shoots, and melon vines and bean stalks are green throughout the garden. Truly, every bend and ridge is a verdant scene, making people love it more and more, making people more and more intoxicated. But, would you believe that just last year, this March Mountain was still a wilderness?

　　Last winter, at the call of the Party committee, a vigorous mountain management movement unfolded. More than 300 young and middle-aged people from the Yezhu Commune, singing songs of the Great Leap Forward, entered March Mountain. It was truly starting from scratch! Not relying on the land, not relying on heaven, not believing in evil, not believing in immortals, just relying on full enthusiasm and lofty ambitions, just relying on pairs of calloused hands, cutting through thorns and brambles, and fighting with the barren mountains. After forty days of hard struggle, more than 1,000 mu of fertile land were opened up.

　　The first battle was won, but the more arduous and important task was yet to come. In order to plant and manage the more than 1,000 mu of land well, a portion of the people had to settle on the mountain for a long time. The commune Party committee was studying how to conduct ideological mobilization when an application written in red paper was submitted to Party Secretary Shi Chaozhong. Who do you think submitted the application? It turned out to be Xie Changfu, the militia battalion commander and demobilized soldier from the Yezhu Brigade.

　　After reading the application, Shi Chaozhong patted Xie Changfu on the shoulder and said, "Good, I knew you had this in you. You really are from the army, always looking for the difficult things, grabbing the hard things. This time you are taking the lead again. However, life on the mountain is not the same as at home, you have to endure hardship! So, the matter of you wanting to move your whole family to the mountain, I'm afraid you still need to consider it." Xie Changfu smiled and said, "We have had a family meeting, and everyone is willing to go to the mountain, no problem." In the end, the commune Party committee still did not give a definite answer. Xie Changfu was restless, and wrote four more applications in a row, and talked to Shi Chaozhong six or seven more times, earnestly saying, "I have thought about it, to take care of this thousand mu of land on the mountain, we have to have a 'whole family team,' going up there as lone individuals, I'm afraid it will be difficult to take root. Secretary Shi, let me set this example for everyone!" Shi Chaozhong finally said excitedly, "We were considering that you have two children, and your old mother is getting on in years, afraid they won't be able to endure it on the mountain. Since you are determined to do this, then we will approve it! Yes! We are starting from scratch, we can't do it without this spirit of poor fellows."

　　In early February, demobilized soldier Xie Changfu and his wife, carrying their children, luggage, furniture, pigs, ducks, and chickens, left their spacious and comfortable old home where they had lived for many years, and happily went to March Mountain.

　　The news of Xie Changfu's whole family going to the mountain spread like wildfire throughout the entire commune. As a result, application after application flew to the commune Party committee office. Especially the young people, their demands were very firm, all saying, "If Old Xie can go to the mountain with his family, what else can we say!" In the end, the Party committee approved sixty people to move to March Mountain.

　　However, there were also a few people who said, "How strange! Not living in brick houses, but living in thatched huts, not spending spring, but spending winter." These words reached Xie Changfu's ears. During work breaks, or in the evenings when sitting idly around a bonfire under the moon, he would say to everyone, "That's right, March Mountain is winter now, and we have to live in thatched huts. If it weren't for this, what would we be doing moving to the mountain! To enjoy ready-made things? We have to look ahead! On this March Mountain, you can step on oil, in a few years, this seventy li of March Mountain will become seventy li of rice and grain mountain, become seventy li of flower and fruit mountain. When that time comes, I'm afraid you won't be able to spend winter even if you want to, then it will truly become March Mountain!" This made the commune members beam with smiles, and their enthusiasm for production was even higher.

　　In April, a cold wave suddenly swept over March Mountain, accompanied by hail. The newly emerging seedlings were severely threatened. Some of the seedlings had already been damaged.

　　At night, Xie Changfu lay on the grass mat, wide-eyed, tossing and turning unable to fall asleep. How could he sleep, every hailstone, crackling down, hit Xie Changfu's heart. Suddenly, he jumped up, gathered the militiamen at the team headquarters, and said loudly, "Comrades! We have taken care of these seedlings with so much effort, with every drop of sweat, it's not easy! Can we just watch them all be killed by the hail? That's right, now we only have empty hands, but we must find a way to save the seedlings. Save as many as we can." In fact, the militiamen had not fallen asleep either, but were all anxiously racking their brains without thinking of a way. Later, Xie Changfu said, "There's a way, we have plenty of mountain bamboo here, we can just weave some bamboo hats and put them on top of the seedlings." One sentence reminded everyone, so everyone started to work, weaving more than three hundred pointed bamboo hats overnight. Afterwards, Xie Changfu led everyone, braving the biting cold wind, enduring the beating of the hail, groping in the dark, and rescued more than three mu of seedlings.

　　Herds of wild animals roamed March Mountain. When the corn began to bud, they also began to come out of the woods and roam in the fields. In order to protect the crops, Xie Changfu organized the militiamen to patrol at night, leading everyone to light bonfires everywhere and set up scarecrows, so that the wild animals would not dare to come to the fields.

　　In order to protect the fruits of the harvest, Xie Changfu worked during the day and led patrols at night, often staying up all night. As a result, his eye sockets began to sink, and his eyes were full of red veins. Commune Party Secretary Shi Chaozhong came to the mountain and saw that Xie Changfu had lost weight, and said with great concern, "Old Xie! You've lost weight, you have to take care of your health! It's one thing to be busy during the day, but you have to get a good night's sleep." Xie Changfu said, "I just can't sleep! Grain is the lifeline, the capital for building socialism, it's about to be harvested, if we don't take care of it and let the wild animals ruin it, how can we face the Party, how can we face the hard work of everyone all winter!" After listening, Shi Chaozhong was excited and moved, thinking, "Old Xie, Old Xie! You are worthy of being a soldier cultivated by the Party. We are building socialism on a 'poor and blank' foundation, and we need people like you; with people like you, no hardship can stop us from striding forward!"

    三月山上英雄汉	田润章　龙德松
        白手起家志气壮，
        千难万难一扫光。
        三月山上创奇迹，
        荒山草地变粮仓。
    湖南古丈县的三月山上，有五重岭，十四道湾，岭岭有坡地，湾湾有梯田，千亩包谷绿油油，朵朵葵花镶金边；柑、桔、松、杉吐新苗，瓜秧豆棵青满园。真是湾湾岭岭，青翠一片，让人越看越爱，让人越看越醉。可是，你相信吗？就在去年，这三月山还是一片荒野。
    去冬，党委一声号召，轰轰烈烈的治山运动展开了。野竹公社三百多青壮年唱着大跃进的歌儿进了三月山。真是白手起家！不靠地，不靠天，不信邪，不信仙，就凭着满腔热情，凌云壮志，就凭着一双双结满老茧的手，披荆斩棘，和荒山野岭展开了搏斗。经过四十天艰苦奋战，一千多亩肥沃的土地开出来了。
    第一仗胜利了，更艰苦更重要的任务却还在后头。为了把一千多亩地种好，管好，就必须有一部分人要长期在山上落户。公社党委正在研究怎样进行思想动员，一张用红纸写的申请书递到了党委书记石朝忠面前。你道递申请书的人是谁？原来是野竹大队民兵营长、复员军人谢长富。
    石朝忠看罢申请书，在谢长富肩膀头上拍了一巴掌，说：“好啊，我晓得你就有这一步，到底是部队上下来的，干什么事总是找困难的，抢艰苦的，这次你又带头了。不过，在山上生活不比在家，得要吃苦啊！所以，你想全家搬上山这件事儿，怕还得考虑考虑。”谢长富笑笑说：“我们开过家庭会了，都乐意上山，没问题。”到最后，公社党委还是没有肯定答复。谢长富坐不是，立不是，接连又写了四次申请书，又找石朝忠谈了六、七次，恳切地说：“我想来想去，要把山上这一千多亩地侍弄好，非得搞‘全家班子’不可，都是一个个光杆上去，怕难扎根。石书记，就让我给大伙起起这个头儿吧！”石朝忠终于激动地说：“我们是考虑你有两个孩子，老母亲又上了岁数，怕在山上受不住。既然你执意要这么办，就批准你吧！是啊！咱们是白手起家，没有这份穷棒子志气也不行。”
    2月初，复员军人谢长富夫妇，带着孩子，挑着行李、家具，带着猪、鸭、鸡，离开了居住多年的宽敞舒适的老家，欢欢喜喜上了三月山。
    谢长富全家上山的消息，像一阵风，立时吹遍了整个公社。于是，申请书一张接一张飞到公社党委办公室去了。特别是青年人，要求十分坚决，都说：“老谢拖家带口能上山，咱们还有什么话说！”最后，党委批准了六十个人搬家到三月山去了。
    不过，也有少数人说：“真怪！瓦房不住住茅屋，春天不过过冬天。”这话传到谢长富耳朵里去了。在劳动间歇时，或傍晚在月下燃起篝火闲坐时，他就对大伙说：“不错，如今三月山上是冬天，得住茅屋。要不是这样，咱们搬上山来做什么！来享现成的？眼睛得往前看哪！这三月山上，一脚能踩出油来，要不了几年，这七十里三月山就变成七十里米粮山，变成七十里花果山了。到那一阵，怕你再想过冬天也不得过了，那才真正成了三月山呢！”说得社员们眉笑颜开，生产的劲头更高了。
    4月间，忽然有一股寒潮，夹带着冰雹卷过了三月山。新出土的幼苗遭到了严重的威胁。有一部分苗儿已经被打坏了。
    夜里，谢长富躺在草铺上，大睁着眼，翻来复去不能入睡。他怎么能睡得着呢，一颗颗冰雹，辟辟拍拍打下来，都打在谢长富的心尖上了。突然，他虎地翻身起来，把民兵们集合到队部，大声说：“同志们！咱们侍弄这些秧苗，一把心血一把汗，不容易啊！能眼看着都叫冰雹打死？不错，如今咱们只有一双空手，可说什么也得想法把苗子救下来。能保住一棵是一棵。”其实，民兵们也都没有睡着，可是都干着急想不出什么法子来。后来，还是谢长富说：“有办法了，咱们这儿有的是山竹，就编些竹帽子，架在秧苗上头不就行了。”一句话提醒了众人，于是大家动起手来，连夜编了三百多个尖尖的竹帽子。随后，谢长富就带领大家，冒着刺骨的寒风，忍着冰雹的敲打，摸着黑，把三亩多幼苗抢救下来了。
    三月山上野兽成群，当包谷开始打苞的时候，它们也就开始走出树丛，在田间活动起来。为了保护庄稼，谢长富就组织民兵们夜间巡逻。带领大家到处烧起火堆，到处扎起稻草人，让野兽不敢到地里来。
    为了保护丰收的果实，谢长富白天劳动，夜里又带班巡逻，常常是彻夜不眠。这样，他的眼窝开始陷下去了，眼里布满了红丝。公社党委书记石朝忠同志到山上来，看见谢长富瘦了，十分关切地说：“老谢！你瘦了，得注意身体呀！白天忙点不说，晚上要睡好觉。”谢长富说：“就是睡不着啊！粮食是命根子，是建设社会主义的本钱，眼看就要收到手了，不照应好，叫野物给糟践了，那可怎么对得住党，怎么对得住大伙一冬的心血呢！”石朝忠听后兴奋而又激动，心里想：“老谢呀，老谢！不愧是党教养出来的战士。咱们在‘一穷二白’的底子上建设社会主义，就是需要像你这样的人；有了像你这样的人，什么艰难困苦也挡不住我们大步大步往前赶！”
