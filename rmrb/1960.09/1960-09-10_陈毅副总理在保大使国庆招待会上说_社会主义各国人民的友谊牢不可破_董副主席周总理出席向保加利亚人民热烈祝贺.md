Xinhua News Agency, September 9th. Bulgarian Ambassador to China, Panchevski, held a reception this evening to celebrate the National Day of the People's Republic of Bulgaria – the 16th anniversary of the socialist revolution.

    Vice Chairman Dong Biwu and Premier Zhou Enlai attended the reception.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke at the reception, extending warm congratulations on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people to the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, and the Bulgarian people.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi said that in the past sixteen years, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Bulgarian people have made tremendous achievements in the cause of socialist construction and have made positive contributions in the struggle to defend peace in the Balkans and the world. Vice Premier Chen Yi wished the Bulgarian people new and greater achievements in the cause of building socialism and safeguarding world peace.

    Speaking of the friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people, Vice Premier Chen Yi said: The Chinese people have always cherished the friendly unity with the Bulgarian people and the people of all socialist countries. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Consolidating unity with the Soviet Union and consolidating unity with all socialist countries is our basic policy and where our basic interests lie." The Chinese people have always followed this instruction of Comrade Mao Zedong and strived to continuously enhance the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people and to consolidate and develop the great unity of the socialist camp.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out: At present, imperialists and modern revisionists are trying every possible means to undermine our friendly unity, but their despicable conspiracies are doomed to failure. The great unity of the people of socialist countries, built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, is unshakable by any force; it is eternal and unbreakable.

    Ambassador Panchevski spoke at the beginning of the reception. In his speech, he introduced the great achievements made by the Bulgarian people in socialist construction over the past sixteen years. He said that Bulgaria has now become a modern industrial-agricultural country with developed socialist industry and large-scale cooperative agriculture.

    The Ambassador said that Bulgaria fully supports the consistent peace-loving policy pursued by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. He pointed out that the Bulgarian government has always strived to defend peace in the Balkan Peninsula. The Ambassador said that Premier Zhou Enlai's initiative on all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, including the United States, concluding a treaty of mutual non-aggression and making this region a zone free of atomic and nuclear weapons is a new proof of the peace-loving policy of the People's Republic of China, and also a valuable contribution to the cause of safeguarding world peace by the socialist camp and progressive mankind.

    Speaking of the friendship between the people of Bulgaria and China, Ambassador Panchevski said that the friendship and fraternal relations between Bulgaria and China are based on steadfast loyalty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and that these relations are flourishing and are being strengthened and expanded day by day.

    The Ambassador said that the Bulgarian people have been following the heroic progress of the Chinese people towards socialism with great interest. The Bulgarian people are sincerely delighted with the tremendous and remarkable achievements made by the talented Chinese people under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in developing the country's economy and culture and significantly improving the living standards of the working people.

    Premier Zhou Enlai proposed a toast at the reception, wishing for the friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people and for the friendship between the people of all countries in the world.
