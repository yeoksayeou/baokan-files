Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 14th. Shanghai Mayor Ke Qingshi held a grand banquet at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building tonight to warmly and solemnly welcome Sékou Touré, the outstanding African statesman who holds high the banner of anti-imperialism and President of the Republic of Guinea, and all distinguished guests of the government delegation of the Republic of Guinea.

Diallo Saifoulaye, Speaker of the Guinean National Assembly, Louis Lansana Béavogui, Minister of National Economy, Keita N'famara, Minister of Planning and other distinguished guests were invited to attend the banquet.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Foreign Minister Geng Biao, and Chinese Ambassador to Guinea Ke Hua, who accompanied President Sékou Touré and the Guinean guests to Shanghai, attended the banquet.

Mayor Ke Qingshi spoke at the beginning of the banquet, warmly welcoming His Excellency Sékou Touré, President of the Republic of Guinea, and all distinguished guests of the government delegation of the Republic of Guinea, who brought the profound friendship of the Guinean people and the African people from the distant African continent.

Mayor Ke Qingshi said: Under the leadership of President Touré, the heroic Guinean people's unyielding struggle against imperialism and colonialism has made significant contributions to the independence movement and unity cause of the African people, and has accelerated the collapse of the imperialist colonial system on the African continent. The people of Shanghai express their heartfelt admiration and warm congratulations to President Touré and the Guinean people for the great victory they have achieved in their struggle.

Mayor Ke Qingshi said: In Africa, old-line colonialists are attempting to maintain their colonial interests through modified methods. At the same time, US imperialism is actively colluding with old-line colonialists to suppress revolutionary people, and on the other hand, it is infiltrating Africa on a large scale in the name of "economic aid," attempting to replace the old colonialists. We are convinced that as long as we adhere to united struggle, the great African people will surely move from victory to victory. The 650 million Chinese people have been, are, and will always be the most reliable friends of the Guinean people and the African people.

Mayor Ke Qingshi condemned the imperialists' slander against the Chinese and Guinean people. He said: This city of Shanghai used to be the largest base for the imperialists to entrenched themselves from which to launch attacks across the country. When this city was just liberated, the imperialists once predicted that we would not be able to live in this city for three months. However, eleven years have passed, and their predictions have become materials for people to mock imperialism. Now, the imperialists are smearing the African people again, saying that "Africans cannot manage their own country." However, the tremendous development that Guinea has achieved in developing its national economy in the two years since its independence has once again proved the truth that only by driving away imperialism and truly achieving national independence, and only when the people become the true masters, is it possible to fundamentally change the backward economic situation created by imperialism. We firmly believe that the brave and hardworking Guinean people and the African people not only have the right but also have the outstanding talent to manage their own country well.

Mayor Ke Qingshi spoke of the joint communiqué issued by President Touré and Chairman Liu Shaoqi during their visit to our capital, Beijing, and the treaties and agreements concluded between China and Guinea. He said: The signing of the aforementioned joint communiqué, treaties and agreements marks that the friendly relations between China and Guinea have developed to a new stage. The people of Shanghai, like the people of the whole of China, are overjoyed by this good news.

President Touré spoke at the banquet. He said: Our visit to the People's Republic of China is of profound and great significance to the people of all African countries and the people of all Asian countries. We are very pleased that the signing of various agreements between the two countries has created new strength between the Chinese people and government and the Guinean people and government. He said that Guinea will faithfully and firmly do its utmost to ensure that the economic and cultural agreements are not only maintained but also developed as quickly as possible.

President Sékou Touré said that the reason why people in some African countries have not yet established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, or have not yet specifically expressed their admiration and trust in your revolution, is only because colonial rule has prevented them. But you can be assured that African freedom will enable it to express its true will.

The President resolutely condemned imperialism and colonialism. He said that nowhere in the world has there ever been a situation where people are willing to be colonized. History has proven that no system, no matter how powerful, can be permanently imposed on the people of another country.

He said that imperialism is retreating step by step, mainly due to its nature which is absolutely contrary to the free will of the people of all countries, its nature which is opposed to the normal development of the people of all countries, and its nature which opposes the unity and progress of the people of all countries. Imperialism, in the name of so-called civilization, once ruled us. The imperialists have enslaved us in the name of freedom; established all kinds of discrimination in our country in the name of democracy; and destroyed the normal development of our country in the name of progress. This exploitation and oppression has aroused reactions among our people, and therefore resistance to exploitation and oppression has emerged everywhere.

Sékou Touré emphasized the solidarity and unity between the Chinese and Guinean people in the struggle against imperialism. He said that we can assure the Chinese people that despite the imperialists' attempts to build a divide between Asia and Africa, attempting to isolate Asia and Africa, thereby weakening the revolutionary camp, you can absolutely trust your African brothers. The imperialists regard you and us as incapable people; they used to be right, we used to be incapable. The talent of the people of a country is directly proportional to the responsibilities they bear for their country; but once the people of all countries have regained their freedom, they show that their talents exceed those of the imperialists. The imperialists' "talent" lies in killing, in destroying culture and economic development. And the talent of the liberated people of all countries and democratic forces is to create life, develop life, build friendship, create peace, and consolidate peace, so that mankind can live in dignity and prosperity.

Premier Zhou Enlai proposed a toast at the banquet. He said: I propose a toast to the friendship between the Chinese and Guinean people, to solidarity between the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America, to the solidarity of the people of the world, to the victory of the struggle against imperialism and colonialism, to world peace, to the health of President Sékou Touré, and to the health of the distinguished Guinean guests.

Mayor Ke Qingshi, President Touré, and Premier Zhou Enlai's words were warmly welcomed.

Those attending the banquet included Chen Pixian, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC, Cao Diqiu, Liu Shuzhou, Song Richang, Song Jiwen, Jin Zhonghua, and Sheng Pihua, Vice Mayors of Shanghai, Chen Wangdao, Hu Juewen, Liu Jingji, and Shen Tilan, Vice Chairmen of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC, Wang Bicheng, Kang Zhiqiang, and Jiang Tengjiao, leaders of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai, as well as heads of various departments of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee, various people's organizations, Shanghai local organizations of various democratic parties, and well-known figures from all walks of life, advanced producers, and directors of the Sino-African Friendship Association in Shanghai.

Consuls from various countries stationed in Shanghai and African foreign guests visiting Shanghai were also invited to attend the banquet.

After the banquet, President Sékou Touré and the distinguished guests of the government delegation of the Republic of Guinea attended a grand artistic performance held by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture. Shanghai artists performed many wonderful programs to welcome the close friends of the Chinese people. After the performance, President Sékou Touré and the Guinean guests, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and Mayor Ke Qingshi, went to the stage and shook hands cordially with the performers and took pictures together.

    柯庆施市长欢宴塞古·杜尔总统
    周恩来总理出席了宴会并在会上祝酒
    据新华社上海14日电　上海市市长柯庆施今晚在中苏友好大厦举行盛大宴会，热烈隆重地欢迎高举反帝国主义旗帜的非洲杰出的政治家、几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔和几内亚共和国政府代表团的全体贵宾。
    几内亚国民议会议长迪阿洛·塞福拉耶，国民经济部长路易·兰萨纳·贝阿沃吉，计划部长凯塔·恩法马拉等贵宾应邀出席宴会。
    陪同塞古·杜尔总统和几内亚贵宾们来上海的周恩来总理和外交部副部长耿飚、我国驻几内亚大使柯华出席了宴会。
    柯庆施市长在宴会开始的时候讲话，他热烈欢迎从遥远的非洲大陆带来了几内亚人民和非洲人民深厚友谊的几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔阁下和几内亚共和国政府代表团的全体贵宾。
    柯庆施市长说：英雄的几内亚人民在杜尔总统的领导下，为反对帝国主义和殖民主义所进行的不屈不挠的斗争，对非洲人民的独立运动和团结事业作出了重大的贡献，加速了帝国主义在非洲大陆的殖民体系的崩溃。上海人民对杜尔总统和几内亚人民在斗争中所获得的伟大胜利表示衷心的敬佩和热烈的祝贺。
    柯庆施市长说：在非洲，老牌的殖民主义者正在企图用改头换面的办法保持他们的殖民利益。同时，美帝国主义一方面积极勾结老牌殖民主义者，对革命人民进行镇压，另一方面又在“经济援助”的名义下，大举渗入非洲，企图取老殖民主义者的地位而代之。我们确信：只要坚持团结斗争，伟大的非洲人民一定能够不断地从胜利走向胜利。六亿五千万中国人民过去、现在和将来都是几内亚人民、非洲人民的最可靠的朋友。
    柯庆施市长谴责了帝国主义对中国人民和几内亚人民的诽谤，他说：上海这座城市，过去就是帝国主义盘据的向全国进攻的最大基地。当这个城市刚刚解放的时候，帝国主义者曾经预言，我们在这个城市里住不上三个月。但是，十一年过去了，它们的预言已经变成了人们嘲笑帝国主义的材料。现在，帝国主义又在那里污蔑非洲人民，说什么“非洲人管不了自己的国家”。但是，几内亚独立两年来，在发展本国民族经济方面所取得的巨大发展，又一次证明了这一个真理，那就是：只有赶走了帝国主义，真正取得了民族独立，人民成了真正的主人以后，才有可能根本改变帝国主义造成的落后的经济面貌。我们深信，英勇的、勤劳的几内亚人民和非洲人民，不仅有权利而且完全有卓越的才能管理好自己的国家。
    柯庆施市长谈到杜尔总统在访问我国首都北京期间同刘少奇主席发表的联合公报和中几两国缔结的条约、协定。他说：上述联合公报、条约和协定的签订，标志着中几两国友好关系已经发展到一个新的阶段。上海人民同全中国人民一样，为这个喜讯而感到欢欣鼓舞。
    杜尔总统在宴会上讲话。他说：我们对中华人民共和国的访问，对于非洲各国人民以及亚洲各国人民，都有深刻的重大意义。我们很高兴，两国之间的各项协定的签订，在中国人民和政府同几内亚人民和政府之间创造了新的力量。他说，几内亚方面将忠诚而坚定地竭尽全力，来使经济和文化协议不仅保持下去，而且得到尽可能迅速的发展。
    塞古·杜尔总统说，有些非洲国家的人们所以迄今还没有同中华人民共和国建立外交关系，或者还没有具体地向你们的革命表示钦佩和信任，这只是因为殖民统治阻止了他们。但是你们可以确信，非洲的自由将使它能表示出自己的真正意愿。
    总统坚决地谴责了帝国主义和殖民主义。他说，世界上任何地方，从来不曾有过人们愿受殖民统治的事情。历史已经证明，任何制度，不管它的力量有多大，它决不能持续永恒地强加于别国的人民。
    他说，帝国主义之所以节节退却，这主要是由于它同各国人民的自由意志绝对背道而驰的本性、由于它同各国人民的正常发展对立的本性、由于它反对各国人民团结和进步的本性。帝国主义以所谓文明的名义，曾经统治过我们。帝国主义者曾经以自由的名义使我们变成奴隶；以民主的名义在我们国家里建立各式各样的歧视；以进步的名义破坏了我们国家的正常发展，这种剥削和压迫在我们的人民中间激起了反应，因此到处出现了对剥削和压迫的反抗。
    塞古·杜尔总统强调了中几两国人民在反对帝国主义斗争中的团结和一致。他说，我们可以向中国人民保证，尽管帝国主义者想尽办法要在亚洲和非洲之间筑起一道鸿沟，企图孤立亚洲、孤立非洲，从而削弱革命者的阵营，但是你们可以绝对信任你们的非洲兄弟。帝国主义者把你们和我们看作无能之人；他们曾经是对的，我们曾经是无能的。一个国家的人民的才能是同他们对自己的国家所担负的责任成正比例的；但是各国人民一经恢复了自由，他们就表现出他们的才能超过帝国主义者。帝国主义者的“才能”在于杀人、在于破坏文化与经济发展。而解放了的各国人民和民主力量的才能，是创造生活，发展生活，建立友谊，缔造和平，巩固和平，以使人类能在尊严和繁荣中生活。
    周恩来总理在宴会上祝酒。他说：我提议为中、几两国人民的友谊，为亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的团结，为世界人民的团结，为反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争胜利，为世界和平，为塞古·杜尔总统的健康，为几内亚贵宾们的健康干杯。
    柯庆施市长、杜尔总统和周恩来总理的话，受到了极其热烈的欢迎。
    出席宴会作陪的有政协上海市委员会主席陈丕显，上海市副市长曹荻秋、刘述周、宋日昌、宋季文、金仲华、盛丕华，政协上海市委员会副主席陈望道、胡厥文、刘靖基、沈体兰，中国人民解放军驻上海部队首长王必成、康志强、江腾蛟，以及上海市人民委员会各部门、各人民团体、各民主党派上海地方组织的负责人和各界著名人士、先进生产者以及中非友协在上海的理事等。
    各国驻上海领事以及正在上海访问的非洲外宾也应邀出席了宴会。
    宴会结束后，塞古·杜尔总统和几内亚共和国政府代表团的贵宾们出席了上海市文化局举办的盛大文艺晚会。上海的文艺工作者为欢迎中国人民亲密的朋友演出了许多精采节目。演出结束后，塞古·杜尔总统和几内亚贵宾们由周恩来总理和柯庆施市长等陪同，上台和演员们亲切握手，并一起照相。（附图片）
