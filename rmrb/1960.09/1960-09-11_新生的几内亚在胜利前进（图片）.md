The people of Guinea, who had long been enslaved and oppressed by imperialism, gained new life on October 2, 1958. Under the leadership of President Sékou Touré, the industrious Guinean people are making unremitting efforts to heal the wounds left by colonialism, get rid of economic and cultural backwardness, and build their own country. In the past two years, in Guinea, the remnants of colonial forces are being gradually eliminated, and the national economy and cultural education are gradually developing. The newborn Guinea is advancing victoriously on the road of independent development.

    The Republic of Guinea has consistently supported the national independence struggles of the people of Asian and African countries and the unity of the people of Asia and Africa. The Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference was held in Conakry, the capital of Guinea.

    1958年10月2日，长期在帝国主义奴役和压迫下的几内亚人民，获得了新生。勤劳的几内亚人民，在塞古·杜尔总统的领导下，正在为医治殖民主义遗留下来的创伤，摆脱经济上和文化上的落后状态和建设自己的国家进行着不懈的努力。近两年来，在几内亚，殖民主义势力的残余正在逐步清除，民族经济和文化教育逐步得到发展。新生的几内亚正在独立发展的道路上胜利前进。
