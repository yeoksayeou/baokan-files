Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 10th: Radio of the Laotian Fighting Forces broadcast on September 7th that the movement of the Laotian people against U.S. imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan clique is flourishing.

According to the broadcast, since August 9th, about 100,000 people in various parts of Laos have participated in struggles in the form of rallies, demonstrations, and distribution of leaflets. Civil servants in Xieng Khouang also held a strike. They expressed their firm opposition to U.S. imperialist interference and demanded an end to the civil war and the implementation of national harmony.

According to the radio broadcast, in order to oppose the Phoumi Nosavan clique's suppression and persecution of the people, the people in various parts of Laos have risen up to armed self-defense. On September 3rd, reactionary officers of the Royal Lao Army led 60 soldiers in a "sweep" in So Sang district, Sam Neua province, and were counterattacked by the people's armed forces. One lieutenant was killed and four officers were captured. Prior to this, on September 1st, a group of reactionary officers of the Royal Lao Army forced soldiers to "sweep" Bose village, four kilometers from Xieng Khouang, and one reactionary officer was captured by the people's armed forces. In addition, more than 3,700 people from Hui Wang, So Nao, Mang Cheng and other places in Phongsaly province gathered to surround the Hui Wang and Nam Ya strongholds, demanding that the Royal Lao Army stop the "sweeps" and withdraw to places far away from the Laotian Fighting Forces, punish officers who have committed crimes against the people, and demand that Phoumi Nosavan withdraw from the government. Many young students in Vientiane also took up arms to prepare for self-defense.

According to the broadcast, under the pressure of the massive people's struggle, the Phoumi Nosavan clique's henchmen in various places are panicked. The Royal Lao Army at the strongholds of Muong Xon, Ban Na, Muong Het, and Ba Lao have been forced to evacuate these places.

At the same time, many Royal Lao Army soldiers surrendered to the people with their weapons. Several hundred soldiers from the garrisons in Khammouane and Savannakhet deserted, and about four companies of soldiers from Kengkheck and Borikhane districts also ran away to their homes.

Xinhua News Agency, September 11th: Washington News: The U.S. State Department issued an insidiously motivated statement on the Laotian situation on the 10th, openly expressing support for the restoration of reactionary forces in Laos, and threatening that the United States would "immediately" intervene in any action to suppress reactionary forces in Laos.

According to reports, the State Department's statement was issued in response to the news that a new so-called "Revolutionary Committee" had been established in Laos. According to the State Department, the committee is led by Prince Boun Oum Na Champassak, former Inspector General of Laos, and Phoumi Nosavan, former Minister of Defense. Boun Oum Na Champassak announced on the 10th that he was the chairman of a so-called "Revolutionary Committee." This committee intends to launch a reactionary rebellion under the pretext of restoring so-called "order and tranquility" to the country, and has announced that it "does not recognize" the Souvanna Phouma government formed after the August coup.

The U.S. State Department's statement backed up the reactionary forces in Laos, saying that "the United States has consistently supported the legally constituted government of Laos in maintaining the independence and integrity of Laos and in countering Communist efforts to invade from outside or within." The statement said that "acts of violence (referring to the August coup led by Captain Kong Le) have undermined (Laos') unity and thereby increased the danger of such invasion." The statement said that the United States "regrets" this situation.

The statement then created an excuse for the United States to intervene in the Laotian situation, saying that "Any activities by any other foreign country or its agents to intervene directly or indirectly by taking advantage of the existing turmoil in (Laos) will immediately make it (the United States) consider this to be related to itself."

    反对美国干涉内政　要求实行民族和睦
    老挝各地人民积极展开斗争
    美国公然扬言要干涉老挝内政支持反动势力复辟
    新华社河内10日电　据寮国战斗部队电台9月7日广播，老挝各地人民反对美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万集团的运动正在蓬勃发展。
    据广播，8月9日以来，老挝各地有约十万人参加了集会、示威游行和散发传单等形式的斗争。川圹的公务人员还举行了罢工。他们表示坚决反对美帝国主义的干涉，要求停止内战，实行民族和睦。
    据这家电台广播，老挝各地人民为了反对富米·诺萨万集团镇压和迫害人民的行为，纷纷起来武装自卫。9月3日，王国军队的反动军官带领六十名士兵在桑怒省索桑县进行“扫荡”时，遭到人民武装力量的反击，一名中尉被打死，并有四名军官被俘虏。在这以前，王国军队一批反动军官在9月1日强迫士兵到离川圹四公里的波色乡“扫荡”时，有一名反动军官被人民武装俘虏。另外，丰沙里省回旺、索恼、芒秤等地三千七百多人民集中起来包围了回旺、南牙两个据点，他们要求王国军队停止“扫荡”，并撤退到远离寮国战斗部队的地方，惩办对人民犯下罪行的军官，要求富米·诺萨万退出政府。万象市许多青年学生也拿起了枪杆，准备自卫。
    据广播，在声势浩大的人民斗争的压力下，富米·诺萨万集团在各地的爪牙都惶惶不安。在芒色、版纳、孟合、巴劳等据点的王国军队都被迫撤离这些地方。
    同时，许多王国军队带着武器向人民投诚。甘蒙、沙湾拿吉等地驻军有几百人开了小差，坎格和波里坎两县也有约四连士兵逃跑回家。
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院10日就老挝局势发表了一项居心叵测的声明，公然表示支持老挝反动势力复辟，并且扬言美国对老挝任何镇压反动势力的行动将“立即”进行干涉。
    据报道，国务院的声明是针对在老挝成立了一个新的所谓“革命委员会”的消息而发表的。据国务院说，这个委员会是由老挝前国家监察长文翁·纳占巴塞亲王和前国防大臣富米·诺萨万领导的。文翁·纳占巴塞在10日宣布他是一个所谓
  “革命委员会”的主席。这个委员会打算在恢复国家的所谓“秩序和安宁”的借口下发动反动叛乱，并且宣布“不承认”在8月政变后成立的富马首相的政府。
    美国国务院的声明为老挝的反动势力撑腰说，“美国过去一贯支持老挝合法组成的政府维护老挝的独立和完整，对付共产党从外部或内部进行侵犯的努力。”声明说什么
  “暴力行为（即指贡勒大尉领导的8月政变）破坏了（老挝的）统一并从而加剧了这种侵犯的危险”。声明说，美国对这种局势“感到遗憾”。
    声明接着就为美国插手干涉老挝局势制造借口说，“任何其他外国或其代理人利用（老挝）存在的骚乱情况直接或间接进行干涉的活动将使它（美国）立即认为这同自己有关。”
