Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 13th, TASS: The Soviet government has lodged a note of protest with the US government regarding the unreasonable restrictions imposed by the US government on the scope of activities of the head of the Soviet delegation to the 15th session of the UN General Assembly, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev. The note states that this is an unprecedented act in the history of the United Nations.

The note says that the US government's action can only be regarded as an unfriendly act towards the Soviet Union, the purpose of which is to obstruct the work of the Soviet delegation to the 15th session of the UN General Assembly. This action by the US government is only intended to worsen the international atmosphere in advance at a time when many heads of state are preparing to make new efforts to ease the international situation.

The note says that the Soviet government protests against the illegal attempt to obstruct the normal work of the Soviet delegation to the 15th session of the UN General Assembly, and demands that the US government strictly fulfill its obligations under the agreement concluded between the US government and the United Nations regarding the location of the central institutions of the United Nations.

The Soviet government also hopes that the US government will ensure that the head of the Soviet delegation can travel unimpeded between New York and Glen Cove (where the Soviet delegation to the UN General Assembly usually resides).

    美无理限制赫鲁晓夫在美活动范围
    苏联政府提出抗议
    新华社14日讯　塔斯社莫斯科13日讯：苏联政府向美国政府提出了一份抗议照会，抗议美国政府无理限制苏联出席联合国大会第十五届会议的代表团团长、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫的活动范围。照会中认为，这在联合国历史上是没有先例的作法。
    照会说，美国政府的这种做法只能认为对苏联的不友好行为，其目的是要阻挠出席联大第十五届会议的苏联代表团的工作。美国政府的这个行动只是为了在许多国家首脑准备作新的努力来缓和国际局势的时候事先恶化国际气氛。
    照会说，苏联政府对非法地想阻挠出席联合国大会第十五届会议的苏联代表团进行正常工作的做法提出抗议，并要求美国政府严格履行它根据美国政府同联合国之间缔结的关于联合国中央机构所在地的协定所承担的义务。
    苏联政府还希望，美国政府保证苏联代表团团长有可能在纽约和格兰考夫（苏联出席联大的代表团通常住在那里）之间畅行无阻。
