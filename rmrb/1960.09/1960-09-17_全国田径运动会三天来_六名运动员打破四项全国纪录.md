Xinhua News Agency, September 16th: The 1960 National Track and Field Meet entered its third day today, with three more athletes breaking two national records. So far, six athletes have broken four national records, and one athlete has tied a national record in the past three days.

    In the men's 400-meter hurdles final, Zhou Lianli and Liang Shiqiang from Beijing both finished with a time of 52.5 seconds, breaking the national record of 53 seconds held by Liang Shiqiang. Liang Shiqiang was only a shoulder's distance behind Zhou Lianli at the finish line, and was thus ranked as the runner-up.
    In the men's 1,500-meter and 10,000-meter finals, it was difficult to tell who would win until the very end. Li Henian from Hebei, the champion of the men's 1,500 meters at the First National Games last year, engaged in a fierce "sprint" competition with Bao Shusen from Heilongjiang in the last 200 meters, and finally crossed the finish line first with a time of 3 minutes 53.2 seconds, breaking the national record of 3 minutes 54.2 seconds held by Yin Fengwu, becoming the second athlete in China to reach the athletic master standard for 1,500 meters (3 minutes 54 seconds). (Yin Fengwu created a new national record of 3 minutes 53.3 seconds in June this year.)
    Bao Shusen came in second with a time of 3 minutes 54.9 seconds.
    Cheng Mingzhao, a 22-year-old long-distance running newcomer from Anhui, sped up in the last 100 meters of the 10,000-meter final today, striving to be the best, and successively overtook Huang Zhiyong, a People's Liberation Army athlete who had been leading, the champion of the 10,000 meters at last year's National Games, and Wang Cunfa from the People's Liberation Army, the champion of this sports meet's 5,000 meters, winning the championship with a time of 31 minutes 48.4 seconds, earning warm applause from the audience. This is the first championship that Anhui track and field athletes have won in a national track and field competition in many years. The young Cheng Mingzhao only began practicing long-distance running at the end of 1958. Last year, his 10,000-meter result at the National Games was 31 minutes 56.6 seconds, ranking only tenth.
    The other final champions today were: Chen Lixiang from Shanxi in the men's 200 meters, 22.1 seconds; Tian Maolin from the People's Liberation Army in the men's decathlon, 5,681 points; Sun Jiuyuan from Shandong in the men's discus throw, 49.07 meters; Li Fude from Heilongjiang in the men's 10-kilometer race walk, 47 minutes 36.8 seconds; and Wang Chunying from Shandong in the women's 200 meters, 25.2 seconds.
    Other better results today were: Zheng Fengrong from Shandong cleared 1.72 meters in the high jump competition of the women's pentathlon; Zhu Ming from Guangdong achieved a result of 7.45 meters in the men's long jump "qualifying round" (qualifying standard 6.90 meters), approaching the national record of 7.53 meters.

    全国田径运动会三天来
    六名运动员打破四项全国纪录
    据新华社16日讯　1960年全国田径运动会今天进入第三天，又有三名运动员打破了两项全国纪录。至此，三天来共有六名运动员打破了四项全国纪录，一名运动员平了一项全国纪录。
    男子四百米中栏决赛，北京选手周连立和梁仕强的成绩同是五十二秒五，都打破了梁仕强保持的五十三秒的全国纪录。梁仕强到终点时只同周连立差一肩的距离，才被列为亚军。
    男子一千五百米和一万米决赛，直到最后一段距离还很难分出谁胜谁负。去年第一届全国运动会男子一千五百米冠军、河北李贺年在最后二百米时同黑龙江包树森展开激烈的“冲刺”竞赛后，才以三分五十三秒二的成绩首先冲过终点，打破了殷凤武保持的三分五十四秒二的全国纪录，成为我国第二个达到一千五百米运动健将标准（三分五十四秒）的选手（殷凤武今年6月曾创造三分五十三秒三的全国新成绩）。
    包树森得第二，成绩是三分五十四秒九。
    安徽二十二岁的长跑新手程明昭，今天在一万米决赛还剩最后一百米时加快步伐，力争上游，连续赶过了原来一直领先的解放军选手、去年全运会万米冠军黄志勇和这次运动会的五千米冠军、解放军的王存发，以三十一分四十八秒四的成绩夺得了冠军，博得观众的热烈掌声。这是安徽田径选手历年来在全国性田径比赛中夺得的第一项冠军。年轻的程明昭从1958年底才开始练习长跑，去年他在全运会上万米成绩是三十一分五十六秒六，只列第十位。
    今天的其他几项决赛冠军是：男子二百米山西陈立祥，二十二秒一；男子十项运动解放军田茂林，五千六百八十一分；男子铁饼山东孙久远，四十九米零七；男子十公里竞走黑龙江李福德，四十七分三十六秒八；女子二百米山东王春英，二十五秒二。
    今天其他较好的成绩是：山东郑凤荣女子五项运动的跳高比赛中，跳过了一米七十二；广东朱明在男子跳远“及格赛”（及格标准六米九十）中，成绩达到七米四十五，接近七米五十三的全国纪录。
