Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Leopoldville Dispatch: Congolese government troops, victoriously advancing towards the lair of the Tshombe separatist group entrenched in Katanga Province, are currently concentrating in large numbers in areas of Kivu Province along the Katanga border. An advance unit of the government army, a company, has already stationed itself thirty kilometers from Katanga Province, and another force has moved south to Kasongo, the southernmost point of Kivu Province.

Another Congolese government force, tasked with suppressing the Kalonji separatist group in Kasai Province, has continued to engage in fierce battles with Kalonji's rebel troops in recent days in Kasai Province, not far from Katanga Province. The government army has also deployed aircraft to distribute leaflets, calling on the remnants of Kalonji's forces to lay down their arms. At the same time, the government army has strengthened the defensive positions around Bakwanga, the center of the Kalonji separatist group that was recently captured.

According to reports, in the face of the government army's steady advance, imperialists are further openly supporting the collaboration between the Tshombe and Kalonji separatist groups, attempting a last-ditch struggle. Sources say that a so-called "Kasai Liberation Army," commanded by white officers and equipped with modern weapons such as Belgian artillery, mortars, and automatic rifles, has already set out from Katanga Province towards Bakwanga on the 3rd, according to the "strategic plan" designed by their masters. Some of those commanding this army are Belgians, as well as Frenchmen and British colonialists from Rhodesia. They have declared that they will organize a "state" in Kasai Province to confront the Congolese central government.

It is reported that Belgian troops concentrated 7,000 troops and equipment at the Kamina base last month, which was then distributed when the Belgian army withdrew from the base. This included artillery and mortars.

According to reports from Elisabethville, mass demonstrations against the Tshombe separatist group have repeatedly erupted in Bakuma, Kabunde, Malamba-Nkula in Katanga Province, and Kabongo-di-Ala in the Kamina region in recent days. The imperialist puppet Tshombe has dispatched troops to suppress and massacre the demonstrators.

    刚果政府军直指加丹加
    另路讨伐军与开赛省叛军展开激战
    帝国主义加紧支持冲伯和卡隆吉分裂集团顽抗
    新华社4日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：向盘据在加丹加省冲伯分裂集团巢穴胜利挺进的刚果政府军队目前正在基伍省沿加丹加省的一些地方大量集中。政府军的前锋部队的一个连已经驻扎在距加丹加省三十公里的地方，另一支军队已经南下到达基伍省最南端的卡松果。
    另一路讨伐开赛省卡隆吉分裂集团的刚果政府军，连日来继续在开赛省距加丹加省不远的地方同卡隆吉的叛军展开激烈的战斗。政府军还出动了飞机，散发传单，号召卡隆吉残余部队放下武器。同时，政府军加强了不久前攻克的卡隆吉分裂集团盘据的中心——巴克旺加四周的防御阵地。
    据报道，在政府军节节逼进的形势下，帝国主义者正在进一步公开支持冲伯和卡隆吉两个分裂集团加紧勾结，企图作最后的挣扎。有消息说，一支由白人军官指挥并以比利时大炮、迫击炮和自动枪支等现代化武器装备起来的所谓“开赛解放军”，已经在3日按照他们的主子设计的“战略计划”从加丹加省开向巴克旺加。指挥这支军队的有一些是比利时人，还有法国人和英国在罗得西亚的殖民主义者。他们扬言要在开赛省组织“国家”，来对付刚果中央政府。
    据报道，比利时军队上个月曾在加米纳基地集中了七千人的军备，这些军备在比利时军撤出基地时就散发了。其中有大炮和迫击炮。
    据来自伊利沙伯维尔的消息说，最近几天来，在加丹加省的巴库马、卡崩德、马朗巴—恩库拉以及在加米纳区的卡崩戈—迪阿拉，都接连不断地爆发了反对冲伯分裂集团的群众性示威，帝国主义傀儡冲伯曾派出军队进行镇压和屠杀示威者。
