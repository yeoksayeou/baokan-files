Competition Celebrates National Day: Steel and Coal Production Increase Simultaneously
Anshan Iron and Steel's Three Major Steel Plants Engage in Comprehensive Competition, Everyone Participates in Skill Contests, Rapid Steelmaking
Sichuan Iron and Steel Workers Offer Ingenious Plans and Add Measures to Overcome Key Production Bottlenecks
Fushun and Xuzhou Coal Mines Launch "100-Day Battle" to Increase Production of Coking Coal
Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, September 27th: The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel's three major steel plants, focusing on open-hearth furnaces, with everyone participating in competition and conducting competitions in all aspects, are driving production forward with a magnificent wave of competition.

As soon as you enter the three major steel plants, the intense competition scene immediately grips your heart. You can hear the heroic steelmakers calling out challenges and engaging in duels through the loudspeakers.

Here, time is steel. Therefore, as soon as the increase production and practice economy movement began, a rapid steelmaking selection competition unfolded among the various open-hearth furnaces in the three major steel plants. Everyone was engaged in intense creative labor to shorten every minute and second. On the first day of the rapid steelmaking selection competition, Wang Fengde, the furnace leader of Ding班班 of No. 23 open-hearth furnace, led his entire team to create a new record of smelting a furnace of steel in just over thirteen hours. Subsequently, Zhao Zhongwu, the furnace leader of 甲班班, used Wang Fengde's experience to shorten the time for smelting a furnace of steel to twelve hours, enabling the entire furnace to win the preliminary round of the rapid steelmaking selection competition.

In the No. 1 Steel Plant, the adjacent No. 4 open-hearth furnace and No. 5 open-hearth furnace are truly evenly matched. During the competition, everyone wanted to overtake the other, but no one was left behind. One day, Sun Qingfu, the furnace leader of No. 5 open-hearth furnace, knew that No. 4 open-hearth furnace had loaded its materials at about the same time, so he ran to the loudspeaker and challenged No. 4 open-hearth furnace: Let's see who can smelt this furnace of steel faster! When the workers of No. 4 open-hearth furnace heard the challenge, they expressed their determination to the acting furnace leader and first assistant, Shi Yongfu: Even though the furnace leader is resting today, we must surpass No. 5 furnace! They immediately convened a "position meeting" and redeployed their forces. Shi Yongfu personally led two people to focus on controlling the key to "furnace temperature." They appropriately increased the temperature of the regenerator and timely adjusted the ratio of gas and air, indeed smelting the steel more than two hours ahead of schedule before No. 5 open-hearth furnace. However, as soon as they finished tapping the steel, No. 5 open-hearth furnace also tapped the steel immediately. As a result, both open-hearth furnaces achieved rapid steelmaking.

Not only are the open-hearth steelmaking workers competing with each other, but all the workers serving open-hearth production are also focusing on the open-hearth and launching a dragon-like collaborative competition.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, September 26th: Workers on the Sichuan iron and steel front are offering ingenious plans and adding measures to launch a major competition to overcome key problems, dedicating outstanding achievements to National Day.

Since September, under the slogan of "Striving to Complete and Overfulfill the September Plan Ahead of Schedule to Welcome National Day," the workers on the Sichuan iron and steel front have been exerting great effort and further launched a high-yield, high-quality competition of furnace against furnace, shift against shift, group against group, and individual against individual. Large and small iron and steel enterprises in various regions have set goals for each ten-day period and each day, identified key production bottlenecks, ranked them separately, and then broken them down one by one.

During the competition, small steel plants are even more vigorous. In converter steelmaking, Yongchuan Steel Plant has conscientiously implemented technical operating procedures such as hot air blowing, extending furnace life, and saving pig iron consumption. The daily output and quality of steel in the first twenty days of September have greatly improved compared with August, and six kinds of alloy steel have been produced.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 27th: Workers in the coal capital of Fushun are launching a large-scale high-yield competition, determined to make full use of every minute and second of the last 100 days of this year to complete the increase production and practice economy plan on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis, and increase the production of more high-quality coking coal to support steel production. In recent days, good news of creating new records to welcome National Day has been frequently reported from various factories and mines. In the first twenty-one days of September, all production indicators such as raw coal and tunneling in the entire mining area have greatly increased compared with the end of July before the massive flood. From the 22nd to the 24th, the daily raw coal production level in the entire mining area increased sharply by more than 22% compared with the first twenty-one days of September.

In recent days, workers in various coal mines have carried out a great competition between shifts, groups, and individuals with selfless labor enthusiasm. Workers in the first shift of the sixth mining area of the Laohutai Mine have promoted the comprehensive application of fourteen advanced experiences such as deep drilling and roof support, continuously achieving a high production level of averaging 1,000 tons of coal per day. Subsequently, all coal mining shifts in the entire mining area launched a great competition of "learning from 6/1, catching up with 6/1, and surpassing 6/1" among shifts and groups. The Xilutian Coal Mine launched a great competition of "red first shift, high second shift, surpassing third shift" among shifts and groups, which greatly improved the coal production level in the first twenty days of September compared with August. Now, all shifts, groups, and individuals in the entire mine have set daily and shift goals based on the 100-day increase production and practice economy plan; after the coal mining section workers launched a shift and group production competition of "loading seven" (loading a car in seven minutes), "guaranteeing ten" (ensuring the quality of ten points per car), "pulling eight" (each locomotive pulling eight times per shift), and "turning four" (turning a car in four minutes), coal production is booming.

Xinhua News Agency, Xuzhou, September 26th: A massive mass movement of "fighting for 100 days and striving for a large increase in coal production" has been widely launched in the Xuzhou mining area. In recent days, production in various mines under the Xuzhou mining area has been booming. From the 18th to the 22nd, raw coal production increased by 12.5% and tunneling footage increased by 25.2% compared with the previous few days.

Starting from September 18th, the first small stage battle of the 100-day battle in the entire bureau has been fully launched. The workers of each mine are in high spirits and good news is pouring in. The Party Secretary and mine director of Xiaqiao Coal Mine and other leading cadres went deep into the front line of the mine on the 21st to direct production on site and help solve key problems in production, promoting production. On the 22nd, sixty-nine groups in the entire mine created new records. (Attached image)

　　竞赛迎国庆　钢煤齐增产
　　鞍钢三大钢厂事事竞赛人人比武快速炼钢
    四川钢铁职工献妙计添措施大破生产关键
    抚顺徐州各煤矿“大战一百天”增产炼焦煤
    本报鞍山27日电　鞍钢三大炼钢厂职工以平炉为中心，人人参加竞赛，事事开展竞赛，波澜壮阔的竞赛热潮正推动着生产不断跃进。
    一走进三大炼钢厂，热浪滚滚的竞赛情景就紧紧地扣人心弦。可以从喇叭里听见炼钢英雄们指名叫阵，打擂比武的豪迈对话。
    在这里，时间就是钢。因此，增产节约运动一开始，在三大炼钢厂的各个平炉之间就展开了一场快速炼钢选拔赛，人人都为缩短一分一秒钟而进行紧张的创造性的劳动。二十三号平炉丁班炉长王凤德在快速炼钢选拔赛开始那天，就带领全班工人，一鼓劲首创十三个多小时炼一炉钢的新纪录。接着，甲班炉长赵忠武运用王凤德的经验，把炼一炉钢的时间缩短到十二个小时，使全炉一举夺得快速炼钢选拔赛预赛冠军。
    在第一炼钢厂，紧挨在一起的四号平炉和五号平炉，真算得是棋逢对手，竞赛中谁都想赶到对方前面去，可是谁也没有把谁拉下。有一天，五号平炉炉长孙清富在接班之后，知道四号平炉差不多也是同时装的料，便跑到扩音器前指名向四号平炉叫阵比赛：看谁这炉钢炼得快！四号平炉工人一听有人叫阵，都对代理炉长、一助手史永富表示决心说：别看炉长今天休息，咱们也一定要赶过五号炉！他们马上召开“阵地会”，重新布置了力量，史永富亲自率领两个人，包打控制“炉温”的关键。他们适当地提高蓄热室温度，及时调整了煤气和空气的比例，果真比计划提前两个多小时赶在五号平炉前面出了钢。可是刚出完钢，五号平炉也紧跟着出钢了。结果，两座平炉双双做到了快速炼钢。
    不仅平炉炼钢工人互相竞赛，而且为平炉生产服务的所有职工也都以平炉为中心，在展开一条龙协作赛。
    据新华社成都26日电　四川省钢铁战线职工献妙计，添措施，开展破关大竞赛，以出色的成就向国庆节献礼。
    9月份以来，四川省钢铁战线的工人在“争取提前和超额完成9月份计划迎接国庆节”的口号鼓舞下，大鼓干劲，进一步开展了炉对炉、班对班、组对组、个人对个人的高产优质对手赛。各地大小钢铁企业按旬、按日订出奋斗目标，摸清生产关键，分别进行排队，然后逐个击破。
    竞赛中，小型钢厂更是生气勃勃。永川钢铁厂在转炉炼钢中，认真执行了热风吹炼、延长炉龄、节约生铁消耗等方面的技术操作规程，9月前二十天钢的日产量和质量，都比8月份大大提高，并且生产出了六种合金钢。
    据新华社沈阳27日电　煤都抚顺职工开展大面积丰产竞赛，决心充分利用今年最后一百天的一分一秒，按日按旬按月地完成增产节约计划，增产更多优质炼焦煤，支援钢铁生产。连日来，创造新纪录迎接国庆节的喜报从各厂矿频频传出。9月头二十一天，全矿区原煤、掘进等各项生产指标，都比特大洪水前的7月末有很大增长。22日到24日，全矿区原煤日产水平又比9月头二十一天猛增22％以上。
    连日来，各煤矿职工都以忘我的劳动热情，开展了班与班、组与组、人与人之间的大比大赛。老虎台矿采煤六区一班工人把深打眼、靠帮棚子等十四项先进经验配套推广，连续达到平均日产千吨煤炭的高额生产水平，接着，全矿区各采煤班都掀起了“学六一、赶六一、超六一”的班组大竞赛。西露天煤矿开展“头班红、二班高、三班超”的班组大竞赛，使9月份头二十天的煤炭生产水平比8月份有了较大的提高，现在，全矿各班、组、个人都根据百日增产节约计划，订出了每日每班的奋斗目标；采煤段工人开展“装七”（七分钟装一台车）、“保十”（车车保证十分质量）、“拉八”（每台机车每班拉八回）、“翻四”（四分钟翻一台车）的班组生产竞赛后，使煤炭产量蒸蒸日上。
    据新华社徐州26日电　一个声势浩大的“大战一百天，力争煤炭大增产”的群众运动，已经在徐州矿区广泛展开。连日来，徐州矿区所属各矿的生产蒸蒸日上，从18日到22日的五天中，原煤产量比前几天增长了12.5％，掘进进尺增长了25.2％。
    从9月18日开始，全局百日大战的第一个小段战役已经全面铺开。各矿职工意气风发，捷报频传。夏桥煤矿党委书记和矿长等领导干部，在21日分头深入井下第一线，在现场指挥生产，帮助解决生产中的关键问题，促进了生产。22日全矿有六十九个小组创造了新纪录。（附图片）
