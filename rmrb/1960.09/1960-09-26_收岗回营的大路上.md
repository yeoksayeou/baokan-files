　　·On the Road Back to Camp After Guard Duty·

　　On the road back to camp after guard duty,
　　A large team of red flags is like rosy clouds,
　　The rosy clouds stir the horse bells,
　　The grain transport convoy is coming.
　　Rubber wheels, black-maned horses,
　　Red tassels tied to the tips of whips,
　　Sacks of grain, carts of laughter,
　　Heading straight for the foot of South Mountain.
　　Commune members sit high on top of the carts,
　　Beating gongs and cymbals,
　　Ha, the carter's bearing is so impressive,
　　As if hauling golden mountains into the granary.
　　I can't help but think of the whole country,
　　At this time of year, who can still sleep at night,
　　Opening the door in the middle of the night to look at the sky,
　　The autumn wind blows ten thousand sickles.
　　On the threshing floor, the fans turn,
　　In the mill, the motors roar,
　　Winnowing the chaff and picking out the sand,
　　The small scales weigh countless golden pagodas.
　　Harvesting, threshing, and delivering at the same time,
　　Singing south of the mountain, answering north of the mountain,
　　Driving cars, harnessing horses,
　　Selling the best grain to the state.
　　How much new grain has come down in September,
　　The big and small granaries can't hold it all;
　　How many roads are there in September,
　　Gleaming, almost crushed.
　　The wheels are like rotary presses,
　　Printing slogans all over the ground;
　　"The People's Commune is infinitely good!"
　　Sticking them straight under the feet of Beijing City.
　　Shaking off the morning dew and entering the barracks,
　　The joy in my heart can't be suppressed;
　　I wipe my gun and think,
　　Of what the instructor said yesterday:
　　"Love the motherland, the motherland is by your side,"
　　Right! Love the motherland—defend her,
　　These columns of cars, these teams of horses,
　　The commune members' enthusiasm is blazing!

### 收岗回营的大路上

　　·收岗回营的大路上·
　　李瑛收岗回营的大路上，一大队红旗像彩霞，彩霞卷得马铃响，送粮的车队过来啦。胶皮轱辘青鬃马，鞭梢系着红缨花，一袋袋的粮食一车车笑，直奔南山下。社员高坐车顶上，又敲锣鼓又敲钹，哈，赶车的把式好气派，好像把座座金山往库里拉。不由我想起全祖国，这节气，夜夜谁还睡得下，半夜推门望望天，秋风吹起镰万把。粮场上，风扇转，碾房里，响马达，播净了秕子拣净了砂，小小秤，称过多少黄金塔。边收边打边上送，山南唱歌山北答，开汽车，套辕马，把顶好的粮食卖给国家。九月新下来多少粮，大囤小囤装不下；九月大道多少条，忽闪闪险些要压塌。车轮就是轮转机，印出条条标语铺地下；
  “人民公社无限好！”一张张直贴到北京城底下。抖掉朝露进营房，心头的欢喜压不下；我一边擦枪一边想，指导员昨天讲过的话：“爱祖国，祖国就在你身边”，对！爱祖国——要保卫她，这一列列车，一队队马，社员们的干劲火辣辣！
