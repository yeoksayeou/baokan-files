　　Changchun, September 25th (from our newspaper) – Since July, the finance and trade departments of various cities and counties in the Tonghua Special District of Jilin Province have successively dispatched 2,200 cadres to work as second managers in the relatively backward public canteens of rural people's communes. They assist in consolidating and improving the canteens, and, using the canteen as a base, have established livelihood service stations, while also conducting financial and trade business in conjunction with the central work.

　　These cadres include those at the section chief level and above from the Party committee's finance and trade departments and various lines of work and bureaus. After arriving at the canteens as second managers, they first focused on improving non-staple food production, reforming cooking tools, planning grain usage, improving the quality of food and service, and further improving the lives of commune members. Finance and trade cadres dispatched to the eight canteens of the Zhong'an Management Area of the Liuhe Town Commune in Liuhe County worked with the original managers and cooks to increase vegetable sources and diversify the menu. Staple foods alone include six or seven varieties such as vegetable buns and fried vegetable pancakes, and they also made food suitable for patients and the elderly. The commune members are very satisfied. More than 200 finance and trade cadres dispatched to the canteens in Hailong County helped the canteens develop non-staple food production, widely planting vegetables, raising pigs and poultry, and establishing non-staple food production bases for the canteens. Now, the county's canteens have planted more than 5,000 hectares of vegetables, averaging more than two fen of vegetable land per rural person, and many canteens have achieved basic self-sufficiency in non-staple foods.

　　The dispatched cadres also helped the canteens carry out cooking tool reforms. According to statistics, rural commune canteens throughout the district have innovated more than 7,300 tools, greatly reducing the labor intensity of cooks, improving work efficiency, and saving a large number of laborers, who have joined agricultural production.

　　While running the canteens well, the dispatched cadres also assisted the commune Party committee in comprehensively organizing the people's economic life. Canteens with dispatched cadres have generally established small commodity shops and livelihood service stations, providing commune members with services such as washing and sewing clothes, writing letters, inviting doctors, buying and selling on behalf of others, and handling savings, which has provided convenience to the masses and expanded purchasing and sales and savings businesses.

　　Finance and trade cadres have close ties with commune members in the canteens, which has enabled them to not only understand what the masses need, when they need it, and how much they need, but also to know what the masses can produce, when they can produce it, and how much they can produce. This enables them to better carry out financial and trade work.

　　通化专区财贸干部下乡当食堂管理员
　  帮助公社办好食堂
    本报长春25日电　吉林省通化专区各市、县财贸部门，从7月份起，先后下放了二千二百名干部到农村人民公社较后进的公共食堂当第二管理员，帮助巩固、提高食堂，并以食堂为基点办起了生活服务站，同时结合中心工作开展财贸业务。
    这些干部中，包括党委财贸部门和各行、局的科长以上的干部。他们到食堂担任第二管理员以后，首先抓紧做好副食品生产、炊事工具改革、计划用粮、提高饭菜质量和服务质量等方面的工作，进一步改善社员生活。柳河县下放到柳河镇公社中安管理区八个食堂当管理员的财贸干部，同原有管理员和炊事人员共同努力，增加菜蔬来源，调剂花样，仅主食就有菜包子、烙菜饼等六、七种，并且做出适合病人、老人吃的饭菜。社员们都很满意。海龙县下放到食堂的二百多名财贸干部，帮助食堂发展副食品生产，普遍种了菜，养了猪和家禽，建立了食堂副食品生产基地。现在，全县食堂已种植蔬菜五千多公顷，平均每一农村人口有菜地二分多，有不少食堂做到了副食品基本自给。
    下放的干部还帮助食堂开展炊事工具改革。据统计，全区农村公社食堂已经革新工具七千三百多件，大大减轻了炊事人员的劳动强度，提高了工作效率，节约出大批劳动力，参加了农业生产。
    下放干部在办好食堂的同时，还协助公社党委全面组织人民经济生活。有下放干部的食堂，普遍建立了商品小卖部，成立了生活服务站，为社员浆洗、缝纫衣服，代写书信，代请医生，代买代卖，代办储蓄，便利了群众，也扩大了购销储蓄业务。
    财贸干部到食堂和社员密切联系，不仅能了解群众需要些什么、什么时间需要、需要多少，而且知道了群众能生产些什么、什么时间生产、生产多少，这就使他们能更好地开展财贸工作。
