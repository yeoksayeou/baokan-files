Fuzhou, September 17th (by our newspaper) In areas with diverse natural conditions and relatively developed multiple economies, how can we implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, ensuring increased grain production, and at the same time, correspondingly develop multiple economies? Chencheng Commune in Dongshan County, Fujian Province, has created experience in this regard.

Chencheng Commune is located on Dongshan Island, and is a diverse economic area combining agriculture, fishing, and salt production. The entire commune has 17,200 mu of cultivated land, 13,500 mu of salt fields, 193 fishing boats, and nine newly established commune-run factories. The natural conditions in this area are poor, with frequent wind and sand, and the land is barren. Historically, importance has been attached to fishing and salt production, while agriculture has been neglected. Some cadres and masses believed that engaging in agriculture required a lot of labor but yielded little income, making it not as good as developing the fishing industry. Those engaged in salt production emphasized the need for specialization, while those engaged in fishing believed that fishing production had its own particularities. In order to implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, the commune party committee, from last winter to this spring, through propaganda and discussion, made everyone realize that only when agricultural production developed could the fishing and salt industries also develop. If agricultural production was not done well, they would be "holding a golden rice bowl but living like beggars." On the basis of unified understanding, everyone further analyzed the favorable conditions for developing agricultural production in the area, such as sufficient fertilizer sources, abundant groundwater, and sandy soil suitable for growing sweet potatoes, greatly increasing their confidence. Cadres and the masses saw the prospects for the development of agricultural production, formulated agricultural production increase plans, and thus consciously formed a mass upsurge of running agriculture and grain production on a large scale.

While ensuring the development of agricultural production, how can we appropriately develop fishing and salt production based on local favorable conditions? To solve this problem, Lin Wuzhang, the first secretary of the commune party committee, went deep into the fishing and salt production brigades to hold symposiums, summarize the experiences of the masses, and formulate specific measures to vigorously develop agriculture, correspondingly develop fishing and salt production, and closely combine and mutually support the three:

First, according to the activities of the agricultural season, coordinate the allocation of labor in various industries, give full play to the superiority of the people's commune system, and achieve the goal that when one industry needs support, all industries support it. Of the 6,542 laborers in the commune, the normal arrangement is: given that the commune has a small amount of farmland, the agricultural field professional team has more than 3,600 people, accounting for 55% of the total labor force in the commune; the seven professional teams of fishing, salt, industry, sideline production, animal husbandry, and logistics have 2,940 people, accounting for 45%; during the busy farming season, 5,200 laborers can be concentrated to invest in the agricultural front, which guarantees agriculture and also takes care of other industries having a certain amount of labor. The labor force occupied by each industry has a fixed proportion, but can also be flexibly dispatched according to different seasons. For example, in the spring when there was a drought, and the spring harvest crops were at a critical juncture, the entire commune concentrated 4,200 laborers to engage in the anti-drought struggle, allowing 2,500 mu of spring harvest crops to obtain a bumper harvest. Subsequently, the commune concentrated more than 5,000 people to reclaim 5,200 mu of sandy wasteland, so that the grain sowing area exceeded the original plan. In May, when the task of the fishing industry (aquatic fry breeding season) was heavy and seasonal, the entire commune concentrated 32 fertilizer-collecting boats, going all out to ensure that the fishing team completed the planting task of 900 mu of fry on schedule. Under the attack of a severe flood, the seawall was in danger, threatening the salt fields, so the Baicheng Brigade immediately organized 120 agricultural laborers to rush to repair and block the breach, so that more than 4,000 mu of salt fields were all out of danger.

Second, every industry has a system, and everyone has a task, so that mutual support between industries is systematized and regularized. The commune party committee, based on the characteristics of each industry, and adapting to local conditions, separately formulated mutual support plans (or quotas) by industry and by person. For example, it is stipulated that each salt worker accumulates 600 dan of saline soil fertilizer a year, each fisherman accumulates 100 dan of fishy water to support agriculture, each farmer carries 1.5 cubic meters of crushed stone a year to support the salt industry, and how much rice straw the agricultural brigade uses to support the fishing industry, and so on.

Third, launch a mass learning technology movement of "one speciality, multiple skills," so that they can farm when it is time to farm, fish when it is time to fish, work when it is time to work, and make salt when it is time to make salt. Because of the large number of all-rounders in various industries, it is guaranteed that the various industries can smoothly support each other.

Fourth, implement the policy of equal value and mutual benefit. There are two main methods: one is to evaluate work and record points, settle accounts on a regular basis, and distribute dividends uniformly; this method is adopted when various industries support agriculture; the second is to pay by the piece, issue cash, and the cash is converted into work points by the brigade and participates in the unified agricultural dividend distribution.

Chencheng Commune has achieved remarkable results by implementing the above methods. The total grain output in the first half of the year increased by 22% compared with the same period last year, and the output of the fishing and salt industries also increased significantly compared with the same period last year. Now, a field management campaign striving for increased autumn grain production is being pushed to a new climax.

    统一安排劳力　支援农业建立制度　开展一专多能运动
    陈城公社农业兴旺渔盐增产
    本报福州17日电　在自然条件不同和多种经济比较发展的地区，如何贯彻执行以农业为基础的方针，保证粮食的增产，同时多种经济也得到相应的发展，福建东山县陈城公社在这方面创造了经验。
    陈城公社地处东山岛，是农、渔、盐三结合的多种经济地区。全社共有一万七千二百亩耕地、一万三千五百亩盐坎、一百九十三条渔船和九个新兴的社办工厂。这个地方自然条件较差，风沙多，田地瘦瘠，历来重渔盐、轻农业，部分干部、群众认为搞农业花工大，收入少，不如发展渔业好。搞盐业的强调盐业生产要专业化；搞渔业的认为渔业生产具有特殊性。为了贯彻执行以农业为基础的方针，去冬今春，在公社党委领导下，通过宣传讨论，使大家认识到只有农业生产发展了，渔、盐业生产才可能发展；农业生产搞不好，就会“捧金斗当乞丐”。在统一认识的基础上，大家进一步分析了当地发展农业生产的有利条件，如肥源足，地下水丰富，沙质地适宜生长甘薯，等等，大大增强了信心。干部、群众看清了农业生产发展的前途，制定了农业增产规划，从而自觉地形成全民大办农业大办粮食的热潮。
    在保证发展农业生产的同时，又如何根据当地有利条件，适当发展渔、盐业生产呢？为了解决这个问题，公社党委第一书记林武章先后深入渔农、盐农大队召开座谈会，总结群众经验，制定了大力发展农业、相应地发展渔业、盐业，三者密切结合、相互支援的具体措施：
    第一，根据农事季节活动，统筹安排各业劳力，充分发挥人民公社制度的优越性，做到一业需要，百业支援。全社六千五百四十二个劳力，平时的安排是：根据该社田地不多的情况，农业田间专业队三千六百多人，占全社劳力的55％，渔、盐、工、副、畜牧、后勤等七个专业队二千九百四十人，占45％；农忙时，可以集中五千二百个劳力投入农业战线，这样保证了农业，又照顾了其他行业也有一定的劳动力。各行业所占用的劳力既有固定的比例，同时又可以根据不同季节灵活调度。例如，春季干旱，春收作物正是丰歉关头，全社就集中四千二百个劳力投入抗旱斗争，使二千五百亩春收作物获得丰收。随后，公社又集中五千多人围垦沙荒五千二百亩，使粮食播种面积超过了原定计划。5月间渔业（土?繁殖期）任务重、季节性强，这时，全社就集中农业捞肥船三十二只，全力以赴，保证了渔业队九百亩?苗的种植任务的按期完成。在特大洪灾袭击下，海堤告急，威胁盐坎，白埕大队就立即组织一百二十个农业劳力抢险堵决口，使四千多亩盐坎全部脱险。
    第二，业业有制度，人人有任务，使各行各业相互支援制度化、经常化。公社党委根据各业特点，因地制宜，分别按业、按人制定互相支援计划（或定额）。如规定每个盐民一年积六百担咸土肥，每个渔民积一百担鱼腥水支援农业，每个农民一年挑一点五方碎石支援盐业，以及农业大队以多少稻草支援渔业等等。
    第三，开展一专多能的群众性的学习技术运动，做到农时能农，渔时能渔，工时能工，盐时能盐。由于各行各业多面手大量出现，保证了各行业间能够顺利地相互支援。
    第四，贯彻等价互利政策。主要办法有两种：一是评工记分，按期结算，统一分红，各行各业支援农业时，采取这个办法；二是按件计酬，发给现金，现金归大队折成工分，参加农业统一分红。
    陈城公社实行上述办法，已获得显著成绩。上半年粮食总产比去年同期增长22％，渔业、盐业产量比去年同期也都有很大提高。现在一个力争秋粮增产的田间管理运动正推向新的高潮。
