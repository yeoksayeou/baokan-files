Xinhua News Agency, September 1st: Speech by Comrade Bo Yibo, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, at the meeting of people from all walks of life in the capital celebrating the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Dear Ambassador Tran Tu Binh, dear head and all members of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association delegation, comrades, friends:

September 2 this year marks the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. People from all walks of life in our capital are holding a grand meeting here with boundless joy to celebrate this glorious festival of the Vietnamese people. On behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, I extend the warmest congratulations to the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the fraternal Vietnamese people!

The Vietnamese people have a glorious revolutionary tradition. They waged a heroic struggle for nearly a century against colonialism and for national independence. Finally, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, they overthrew imperialist colonial rule in August 1945 with an armed general uprising and established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Since then, the Vietnamese people have entered a new historical period of being masters of their own affairs.

The success of the August Revolution and the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam were the first major victory in the struggle of the people of colonies and semi-colonies against colonialism after the Second World War. But imperialism is never reconciled to its defeat. Shortly after the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, French imperialism, with the support and encouragement of the US-led imperialist bloc, made a comeback, attempting to subdue the Vietnamese people with its modernly equipped sea, land, and air forces and restore its colonial rule. Imperialist attempts at aggression will not succeed in the face of people who have already awakened. The heroic Vietnamese people, closely united around their party and leader, rose up to defend their motherland and defend their independence, and fought a bloody nine-year war of resistance against imperialism. Finally, in 1954, French imperialism was forced to sign the Geneva Accords with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, so that the territory north of the 17th parallel in Vietnam was completely liberated. This great victory of the Vietnamese people became a brilliant example of how the people of colonies and semi-colonies can defeat imperialist armed aggression by relying on their own united strength.

The long-term rule and exploitation of colonialism, as well as the destruction of the nine-year war, brought extremely serious difficulties to the economic construction of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. However, the hardworking and brave Vietnamese people cannot be intimidated by any difficulties. Under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, they have worked hard with a strong revolutionary will and selfless labor enthusiasm, advancing along the road of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

At present, the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in North Vietnam is proceeding victoriously. The majority of individual farmers and handicraft laborers have been organized, and cooperation will be basically realized this year. The capitalist relations of production in private industry and commerce have begun a fundamental change. With the deepening of socialist transformation, the socialist consciousness of the Vietnamese people has also been rapidly improved. Since the armistice, the national economy of North Vietnam has rapidly recovered and developed. The output value of industry and handicrafts has increased by nearly 30% annually from 1955 to 1959. State-owned industry in 1959 increased by more than sixteen times compared to 1955. While developing the central industry, the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have also vigorously developed local industries. On the basis of land reform and agricultural cooperation, agricultural production in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has also made great achievements. From 1955 to 1959, the total agricultural output value increased by an average of 11.1% annually, and the output of rice in 1959 was more than double the highest pre-war annual output. The rapid growth of industrial and agricultural production has simultaneously promoted the great development of cultural and educational undertakings, and the material and cultural life of the people has been significantly improved. At present, in order to welcome the great celebration of the 15th anniversary of the founding of the country, the Vietnamese people are carrying out labor competitions in full swing, ensuring the successful completion of the three-year plan, and preparing for the upcoming five-year plan. We believe that in the years to come, the fraternal Vietnamese people will surely achieve even more brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

While North Vietnam is becoming increasingly prosperous, South Vietnam is a scene of misery and desolation. Under the dark rule of US imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet regime, the people of South Vietnam are still threatened by unemployment, poverty, hunger, and persecution. This situation is in stark contrast to North Vietnam. The Vietnamese people have long hated US imperialism, their most ferocious enemy, to the bone. The people of North Vietnam have continuously launched large-scale mass movements against US aggression and for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. The people of South Vietnam are also increasingly awakening and rising up to wage a resolute struggle against the bloody "sweeping" and massacre policies of the US-Ngo clique. The frantic struggle of US imperialism and its running dogs cannot save them from their inevitable final fate. The Vietnamese people's desire for the peaceful reunification of their motherland will definitely be realized, and the 650 million Chinese people will forever support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people until they achieve final victory.

China and Vietnam are both peace-loving countries. Our two countries have consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy, and have made unremitting efforts to achieve peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, ease international tensions, and safeguard peace in Asia and the world. At the Geneva Conference six years ago, our two countries made significant joint contributions to promoting the armistice agreement in Indochina. Since the restoration of peace, our two countries have carried out an indomitable struggle to maintain the Geneva Accords. In accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has put forward many reasonable proposals on the issue of consolidating peace in the Indochina region and realizing the peaceful reunification of the motherland. These proposals have received the sympathy and support of peace-loving people and countries in the world, but have been stubbornly rejected by the imperialist bloc headed by the United States. US imperialism not only openly violated the provisions of the Geneva Accords, illegally transporting large numbers of military personnel and weapons and ammunition into South Vietnam, building military bases everywhere, but also used the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to continuously carry out military threats and subversive and sabotage activities against the Indochina countries. The United States is intensifying its interference in Laos' internal affairs through its vassal states, attempting to prevent Laos from taking the path of peace and neutrality. In order to cover up its aggressive activities, US imperialism has falsely accused China and Vietnam of "expanding" in Indochina. However, the facts of the six years since the Indochina armistice cannot be changed by anyone. The whole world is clear about who is maintaining peace in Indochina and who is undermining peace in Indochina, and no lies can deceive them. China and Vietnam's position of safeguarding peace in Indochina is firm and unwavering, and the will of the people of Indochina to oppose foreign interference and safeguard national independence cannot be shaken by any force. No matter what kind of conspiracy US imperialism adopts, its plan of aggression against Indochina is doomed to failure.

US imperialism's evil activities in Indochina are an integral part of its overall policy of war and aggression. Recently, the United States has been adopting similar tactics as it has in Indochina, intensifying its aggressive and expansionist activities against African and Latin American countries, especially against the Congo and Cuba. On the one hand, the United States is clamoring about the so-called Soviet and Chinese infiltration into Africa, and on the other hand, it is openly and blatantly interfering in the internal affairs of the Congo under the banner of the United Nations, infringing upon the sovereignty of the Congo, and attempting to replace the Belgian colonialists and re-enslave and exploit the Congolese people. It is worth noting that after carrying out a series of military threats, economic blockades, and subversive and sabotage activities against the revolutionary Cuban people, the United States coerced the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers on August 28 to pass a "Declaration of San Jose" that created an excuse for further interference in Cuba. In this declaration, US imperialism has done its best to reverse black and white, falsely accusing China and the Soviet Union of endangering the peace and security of the Americas, and accusing Cuba, which has been interfered with and invaded, of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and endangering the unity and security of the Americas. However, it is very clear that US imperialism's evil attempts to blame China and the Soviet Union, to use Africans to fight Africans, and to use Latin Americans to fight Latin Americans will absolutely not succeed. The Congolese people and the people of all African countries are increasingly vigilant about the United States' aggressive activities in the Congo and Africa. The heroic Cuban people are always ready to fight back against any aggression and provocation by the United States. The people of all Latin American countries firmly support the just struggle waged by the Cuban people's envoys at the Meeting of American Foreign Ministers, and have shouted the slogan "Cuba yes, Yankees no" everywhere. All of this shows that US imperialism's evil activities will more thoroughly expose its bandit face and will accelerate its own failure. At present, the storm of the world's people's struggle against US imperialism is rising, and the forces striving for peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism are growing stronger day by day. The recent successful launch and safe and accurate return to Earth of the Soviet Union's second spaceship once again demonstrated the great achievements of the Soviet people in science and technology and greatly encouraged the will of the people of all countries to fight against US imperialist aggression and defend world peace. We firmly believe that in this excellent situation, as long as all forces that uphold world peace and oppose imperialist aggression further unite and persist in their struggle, they will surely be able to defeat any aggression and war activities of US imperialism and make continuous victories in the cause of safeguarding world peace and striving for human progress.

China and Vietnam are close neighbors, and there are deep feelings between our two peoples. In the long struggle against common enemies, we have always sympathized with and supported each other, and formed a solid fighting friendship. After the two countries' revolutions won victories one after another, we united in the socialist family and established closer relations of mutual assistance and cooperation based on Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism. The fruitful and comprehensive cooperation between our two countries in the cause of building socialism has powerfully promoted the continuous upsurge of both sides' economies and cultures. The friendly unity of the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples has strengthened the strength of the socialist camp and is conducive to the struggle against imperialist aggression and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people will unswervingly strive to consolidate and develop the fraternal friendship between our two peoples. Let us further join hands and forge ahead courageously towards our common great goal!

Long live the Democratic Republic of Vietnam!
Long live the eternal friendship and unity between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples!
Long live the unbreakable great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live world peace!
Long live President Ho Chi Minh, the great leader of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the Vietnamese people!

    中越两国坚决维护印度支那和平
    美帝国主义的侵略计划注定失败
    中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理薄一波在首都各界大会上的讲话
    新华社1日讯　中共中央政治局候补委员、中华人民共和国国务院副总理薄一波同志在首都各界庆祝越南民主共和国成立十五周年大会上的讲话。亲爱的陈子平大使同志，亲爱的越中友协代表团团长和全体团员同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    今年9月2日是越南民主共和国建国十五周年。我们首都各界人民怀着无限喜悦的心情在这里举行盛大集会，庆祝越南人民这个光荣的节日。我代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民向越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和兄弟的越南人民表示最热烈的祝贺！
    越南人民有着光荣的革命传统，他们为反对殖民主义、争取民族独立，进行了近百年的英勇斗争，终于在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，于1945年8月用武装总起义推翻了帝国主义的殖民统治，建立了越南民主共和国。从此，越南人民就进入了自己当家作主的新的历史时期。
    八月革命的成功和越南民主共和国的成立，是殖民地、半殖民地人民在第二次世界大战后，反对殖民主义斗争的第一个重大的胜利。但是帝国主义绝不甘心于它的失败。在越南民主共和国成立不久，法帝国主义就在以美国为首的帝国主义集团的支持和鼓励下，卷土重来，妄图以现代化武器装备的海、陆、空军压服越南人民，恢复自己的殖民统治。帝国主义的侵略企图，在已经觉醒了的人民面前是不会得逞的。英勇的越南人民紧密地团结在自己的党和领袖的周围，奋起保卫祖国，保卫独立，同帝国主义进行了九年的浴血抗战，终于迫使法帝国主义在1954年同越南民主共和国签订了日内瓦协议，使越南十七度线以北的领土获得了彻底的解放。越南人民的这一伟大胜利，成为殖民地半殖民地人民依靠自身团结起来的力量战败帝国主义武装进攻的一个光辉榜样。
    殖民主义的长期统治和压榨以及九年战争的破坏，给越南民主共和国的经济建设带来了极其严重的困难。但是，勤劳勇敢的越南人民是任何困难也吓不倒的。他们在越南劳动党的领导下，以坚强的革命意志和忘我的劳动热情，艰苦奋斗，沿着社会主义革命和社会主义建设的大道前进。
    目前，越南北方的农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造正在胜利地进行。个体农民和手工业劳动者大部分已经组织起来，今年内就要基本上实现合作化。私营工商业的资本主义生产关系已经开始了根本性的改变。随着社会主义改造的不断深入，越南人民的社会主义觉悟也有了很快的提高。停战以来，越南北方的国民经济有了迅速的恢复和发展，工业和手工业的产值从1955年到1959年平均每年增长近30％；1959年国营工业比1955年增长了十六倍以上。在发展中央工业的同时，越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府也大力兴办地方工业。在土地改革和农业合作化的基础上，越南民主共和国的农业生产也取得了巨大的成就。1955年到1959年，农业总产值平均每年增长11.1％，1959年稻谷的产量比战前最高年产量提高了一倍以上。工农业生产的迅速增长，同时促进了文化教育事业的巨大发展，人民的物质和文化生活有了显著的改善。目前，越南人民为了迎接十五周年国庆这个大喜日子，正在热火朝天地开展劳动竞赛，保证胜利地完成三年计划，并且为即将开始的五年计划作好准备。我们相信，兄弟的越南人民在未来的岁月中，一定能够在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的事业中取得更加辉煌的成就。
    在越南北方日益繁荣兴旺的同时，越南南方到处是一片悲惨凄凉的景象。在美帝国主义和吴庭艳傀儡政权黑暗统治下的越南南方人民，仍然受着失业、贫困、饥饿和迫害的威胁，这种情况同越南北方形成了鲜明的对照。越南南方人民的痛苦处境是由于美帝国主义横蛮地阻挠越南和平统一和吴庭艳集团一贯执行投靠美帝国主义的政策的结果。越南人民对于美帝国主义这个最凶恶的敌人，早已恨之入骨。越南北方人民不断掀起了反对美国侵略和争取祖国和平统一的大规模的群众运动。越南南方人民也在日益觉醒，纷纷起来同美吴集团的血腥“扫荡”和屠杀政策进行坚决的斗争。美帝国主义和它的走狗的疯狂挣扎决不能挽回他们必然失败的最后命运。越南人民和平统一祖国的愿望是一定要实现的，六亿五千万中国人民永远支持越南人民的正义斗争直到他们取得最后的胜利。
    中国和越南都是热爱和平的国家。我们两国一贯奉行和平的外交政策，为争取实现不同社会制度国家的和平共处，缓和国际紧张局势，和保卫亚洲和世界的和平做出了坚持不懈的努力。在六年以前的日内瓦会议上，我们两国曾经为促成印度支那的停战协定共同作出了重大的贡献。从和平恢复以来，我们两国又为维护日内瓦协议进行了不屈不挠的斗争。越南民主共和国根据日内瓦协议的规定，曾经就巩固印度支那地区的和平和实现祖国的和平统一的问题提出了许多合情合理的建议。这些建议得到世界上爱好和平的人民和国家的同情和支持，但是，却一直遭到以美国为首的帝国主义集团的顽固拒绝。美帝国主义不仅公然违反日内瓦协议的规定，在越南南方非法运入大批军事人员和武器弹药，到处建设军事基地，而且利用东南亚条约组织对印度支那各国不断地进行军事威胁和颠覆破坏活动。美国正在通过它的仆从国家加紧干涉老挝的内政，企图阻止老挝走和平中立的道路。美帝国主义为了掩盖它的这些侵略活动，却诬蔑中国和越南在印度支那进行“扩张”。但是，印度支那停战以来六年的事实是任何人也改变不了的，究竟谁在维护印度支那和平，谁在破坏印度支那和平，全世界人民一清二楚，绝不是任何谎言所能蒙蔽的。中国和越南维护印度支那和平的立场是坚定不移的，印度支那各国人民反对外来干涉、维护民族独立的意志也是任何力量所不能动摇的。美帝国主义不管采取什么阴谋手法，它对印度支那的侵略计划是注定要失败的。
    美帝国主义在印度支那的罪恶活动是它的总的战争政策、侵略政策的一个组成部分。最近，美国正在采取它在印度支那所采取的类似的手法，加紧对非洲和拉丁美洲各国特别是对刚果和古巴的侵略扩张活动。美国一方面大肆叫嚣什么苏联和中国向非洲渗入，一方面却利用联合国的招牌公开露骨地干涉刚果的内政，侵犯刚果的主权，企图代替比利时殖民主义者，重新奴役和压榨刚果人民。值得严重注意的是，美国在对革命的古巴人民进行了一系列军事威胁、经济封锁和颠覆破坏的活动以后，又在8月28日胁迫美洲外长协商会议通过了一个为进一步干涉古巴制造借口的“圣约瑟宣言”。在这个宣言中，美帝国主义竭尽颠倒黑白之能事，诬蔑中国和苏联危害美洲的和平与安全，给被干涉被侵略的古巴安上了干涉别国内政、危害美洲团结和安全的罪名。但是，事情很清楚，美帝国主义妄想嫁罪中苏、利用非洲人打非洲人、利用拉丁美洲人打拉丁美洲人的罪恶企图是绝对办不到的。刚果人民和非洲各国人民已经越来越警惕地注视着美国在刚果和非洲的侵略活动。英雄的古巴人民时刻准备着反击美国的任何侵略和挑衅。拉丁美洲各国人民坚决支持古巴人民使者在美洲外长会议上所进行的正义斗争，并且到处喊出了“要古巴、不要美国佬”的口号。所有这些说明，美帝国主义的罪恶活动将更加彻底地暴露它的强盗嘴脸，将更加加速它自己的失败。目前，全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争风暴正在风起云涌，争取和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义的力量正在日趋壮大，社会主义阵营的力量和影响正在日益增长。最近，苏联第二个宇宙飞船的成功发射和安全准确地返回地面，再一次显示了苏联人民在科学技术方面的伟大成就，大大地鼓舞了各国人民反对美帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平的斗争意志。我们深信，在这种大好形势下，只要一切维护世界和平和反对帝国主义侵略的力量进一步团结起来，坚持不懈地进行斗争，就一定能够击败美帝国主义的任何侵略和战争的活动，使保卫世界和平和争取人类进步的事业取得不断的胜利。
    中越两国是亲密的邻邦，我们两国人民之间有着深厚的感情。在长期反对共同敌人的斗争中，我们一向互相同情，互相支持，结成了巩固的战斗友谊。在两国革命先后获得胜利以后，我们在社会主义大家庭中团结一致，根据马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的原则建立了更加亲密的互助合作关系。我们两国在建设社会主义的事业中所进行的卓有成效的全面合作，有力地促进了双方经济和文化的不断高涨。中越两国人民的友好团结，加强了社会主义阵营的力量，有利于反对帝国主义侵略和保卫亚洲和世界和平的斗争。中国人民将始终不渝地为巩固和发展我们两国人民的兄弟友谊而努力。让我们进一步携起手来，朝着我们共同的伟大目标奋勇前进！
    越南民主共和国万岁！
    中越两国人民永恒的友谊和团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营牢不可破的伟大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    越南劳动党和越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席万岁！
