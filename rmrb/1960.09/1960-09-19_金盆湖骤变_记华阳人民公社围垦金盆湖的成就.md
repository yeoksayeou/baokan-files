Dramatic Change in Jinpen Lake
——A Record of the Achievements of the Huayang People's Commune in Reclaiming Jinpen Lake
By our reporters Wang Qin and Feng Wusheng, Writing Group of Huayang People's Commune, Wangjiang County.

This is a story that took place in Huayang People's Commune, Wangjiang County, Anhui Province: Last summer, an old man named Li Qisheng from Wuwei County, more than 300 *li* away from Huayang People's Commune, caught a lot of fish in Jinpen Lake. The old man was very happy. This year, he gathered four or five companions from his village, and brought his nets to Jinpen Lake again. However, when they arrived at the lakeside, they were shocked to find that the original expanse of white lake water had now turned into a green sea of rice! This magical transformation astonished them.

Jinpen Lake: A New Look

One day in midsummer, we followed Comrade Li Zhijing, Deputy Secretary of the Huayang People's Commune Party Committee and head of the Jinpen Lake Rice Production Command, to visit Jinpen Lake as it is today. Standing on the water-lifting dam near the command post, we could not suppress the excitement in our hearts at the sight before us: the black, oily green rice plants rolled in the wind, looking like an endless green brocade quilt. The "Happiness River," more than 8,000 meters long, runs from east to west across the heart of the lake, and the wide, flat "Evergreen Road" runs vertically across the heart of the lake. In the four large rice fields crisscrossed by the "Happiness River" and the "Evergreen Road," there are canals as dense as spider webs; in these rivers and canals, lotus flowers are in full bloom, like countless bright ribbons embroidered on this endless green brocade quilt. We walked along "Evergreen Road" towards what used to be the center of the lake. The early rice near the lake had already been harvested, and double-season late rice had now been planted. Continuing forward, we saw a large area of single-season late rice, each plant as thick as a bowl, more than two *chi* high, and the commune members were weeding in the fields. We came to a bridge at the intersection of "Happiness River" and "Evergreen Road." Secretary Li excitedly pointed to a large character "金" (gold) on the bridge and said, "This is the 'Golden Bridge' that we just built. This place is the former heart of the lake, which is two meters lower than the water level near the Yangtze River. Now, we want the heart of the lake to produce grain!" On the way back, Secretary Li also told us about their plans to use the river network to develop fish farming (more than 9.25 million fish have already been released) and poultry farming, how to manage and utilize the lotus flowers in the canals, and how to beautify Jinpen Lake in an all-round way. Secretary Li also told us that some elderly people who came to Jinpen Lake were even moved to tears when they saw such a large area of good rice growing here. Zhou, an old man from the Dahao Brigade, automatically went to the podium on the day of the celebration meeting for the completion of the canal and proposed that the heart-of-the-lake river be named "Happiness River" and the main road be named "Evergreen Road." This is the origin of the names of this river and this road.

A Wonderful Legend

Located by the lake near the river, the Huayang area before liberation was a vast expanse of water whenever the water rose, with no distinction between the river and the lake. This place suffered from heavy rains and floods, and small rains and waterlogging. When it didn't rain, there was drought, and harvests were not guaranteed. Coupled with the cruel exploitation and oppression by landlords and reactionary governments, the lives of the masses were extremely miserable. A folk song sang: "In spring, we rely on grass (cutting lake grass), and in autumn, we rely on firewood (cutting reed firewood). We go to the river and come to the lake (to fish)!" Agricultural harvests here were so pitiful: "Sharpen the knife to harvest enough for one meal, put down the knife handle and beg for food!" After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, great efforts were made to control water, and significant victories were achieved in controlling water damage. However, Jinpen Lake, one of the sources of disaster, had not been completely eradicated. In the event of a major flood, it still flooded tens of thousands of *mu* of fertile land around the lake like a *jiao* dragon.

Regarding Jinpen Lake, the elderly remember such a legend: a long, long time ago, Jinpen Lake was a "treasure basin" that produced everything. However, later a *jiao* dragon came to the lake. It had to pay homage to the Dragon King every summer, and every time it paid homage, it stirred up darkness and lightning, and the lake water was as high as several *zhang* in good times, and at least three *chi*. According to the elders, Jinpen Lake was named because its shape resembled a basin. Before the formation of the levee area around the lake, the water in an area of more than 100 square kilometers in the entire levee area flowed into the lake from all directions. Over the years, silt accumulated, the lakebed gradually silted up, and the storage capacity shrank, often leading to flooding.

After liberation, the people along the lake no longer believed in the superstitious legend of the *jiao* dragon. Some people began to reclaim some land by the lake, but most of their labor did not bring the rewards they deserved, and sometimes they even worked in vain. The experience of Xu Lide, Deputy Secretary of the Huayang Brigade's General Branch, who went to Jinpen Lake four times before the communization, is a microcosm of the arduous struggle of the people along the lake against this "jiao" dragon. Xu Lide first went to Jinpen Lake more than 20 years ago, carried there by his father in a rice basket. At that time, Jinpen Lake was a place where "cattle and sheep grazed in spring, wild geese rested in winter, and white water met the blue sky in summer and autumn." Because the lake water flooded year after year, not only was it impossible to harvest crops, but the whole family almost lost their lives in the lake. After liberation, Xu Lide served as the head of the mutual aid group. That year, he invited four neighbors to go to Jinpen Lake for the second time, enclosing 28 *mu* of land by the lake and planting crops, but when the seedlings were lush and green, a summer flood washed everything away. In 1955, the elementary cooperative was established, and Xu Lide served as the director. He led dozens of cooperative members to Jinpen Lake for the third time. This time the strength was greater, and they opened up 70 *mu* of wasteland and surrounded it with a small 'whisker' dike. However, in late May of that year, they encountered several heavy rains. Despite the cooperative members braving the rain to drain and rescue the land, most of the enclosed fields were still flooded. In the autumn of that year, the advanced cooperative was established. Xu Lide led more cooperative members to Jinpen Lake for the fourth time. This time, they made a more comprehensive plan for the lake fields near their cooperative, the dike was built high, the ditches were dug deep, and more than 200 *mu* of land was reclaimed. The cooperative members happily planted rice after the new year. But that year they encountered another internal flood, and the flood broke through the dike. He led more than 300 cooperative members to fight the flood desperately for seven days and nights, saving most of the rice, but ultimately did not harvest much grain because the seedlings were too badly damaged. Xu Lide deeply felt that the strength of an advanced cooperative was still too small.

Secretary Explores the Heart of the Lake

Under the leadership of the Party, the people on the shore of Jinpen Lake finally relied on the power of the People's Commune to subdue the "jiao" dragon that had been harming them for many years in just six months, turning it into a veritable Golden Basin Lake.

"March into Jinpen Lake, demand grain from Jinpen Lake!" This was the bold decision made by the Huayang People's Commune Party Committee after seriously studying the county party committee's call to "march vigorously into wasteland lakes" and "turn wasteland lakes into rice granaries" last autumn. After 1958, the commune's lake area had opened up more than 5,670 large and small ditches, and built two new drainage and irrigation sluice gates. More than 8,000 meters of synthetic levee drainage and irrigation channels were built around Jinpen Lake, ensuring water use for more than 80,000 *mu* of land in the commune. However, Jinpen Lake, located in the very center of the synthetic levee, had not yet been completely cured. To fundamentally improve natural conditions, Jinpen Lake must first be enclosed.

In recent years, due to the large-scale water conservancy projects built by the state and the commune around Jinpen Lake, the violent nature of the Jinpen "jiao" dragon has been greatly restrained. After the commune built the synthetic levee and drainage ditches around Jinpen Lake, the phenomenon of external water flowing inward had been basically stopped; after the state built the Huayang Sluice Gate on the Huayang River, not only was the backflow of river water controlled, but the water level of Jinpen Lake was also greatly reduced. Since the establishment of the commune, the purchase of twelve tractors, two combine harvesters, and many other machines has enabled the release of some labor to manage the lake and reclaim wasteland. After studying the above situation, the commune party committee believed that with a great effort in the winter and spring, it was entirely possible to fundamentally change Jinpen Lake.

The decision of the Commune Party Committee to enclose Jinpen Lake embodied the long-cherished wish of the people along the lake and was supported by the vast number of commune members. A wave of enthusiasm for registering to participate in lake management was quickly launched in the commune. Soon, an army of more than 4,000 people, as active as dragons and tigers, arrived at the edge of Jinpen Lake.

Great Battle in the Lake-Bottom River

On December 20th last year, the struggle to dig the lake-bottom river began. This was the first battle of the entire lake management project, and it was also a battle that determined the success or failure of the lake management. Without first opening up the lake-bottom river, the water stored in the lake could not be drained, and other projects such as enclosing fields would be impossible to start. Therefore, the construction site command adopted a combination of "all-round flowering" and "concentrated assault in sections." Camps were connected along the four sides of the lake, and red flags fluttered; the motors of the mechanical drainage and irrigation stations roared day and night in the southeast corner of the lake. Four thousand strong men from eight squadrons unfolded a hot competition to catch up with each other. The Huayang Lake Management Squadron, led by Xu Lide, an old general who had been to Jinpen Lake four times, took the lead with one burst of energy; then, the Baisha Squadron overtook the Huayang Squadron again. They chased each other and refused to give in. Before communization, the Huayang Squadron and the Yangchang Squadron were two advanced cooperatives facing each other across the lake. At that time, they had argued many times over enclosing levees and discharging water; now, everyone is in one commune, sharing weal and woe, and transforming nature. When Secretary Li of the Yangchang Squadron saw that the Huayang Squadron, which had taken the lead many times, had encountered a section of rotten mud road that was the most difficult to dig, and the work efficiency had dropped rapidly, he immediately mobilized the members of his squadron to go to support them. With the support of the Yangchang Squadron and several other squadrons, this section of the road was quickly broken through.

The river channel became deeper and deeper, and the project became more and more difficult. Because the commune members were active in mud and water up to their legs or waists all day long, and in mud and water with many thorny lotus stems and water chestnuts, the work efficiency began to decline, and people were very anxious. Therefore, the Commune Party Committee organized the squadrons to vigorously carry out tool reforms and technological innovations. Walking in the mud and water was inconvenient, so the Huayang Squadron came up with "land boat travel," and as a result, the average daily work efficiency of the entire squadron suddenly increased from three *fang* to thirty-eight *fang*; then, the Xin Nonglin Squadron successfully modified the rope-drawn mud machine, which made the daily work efficiency jump to a record high of eighty-six *fang*. In this way, the entire construction site used more than 24,500 new tools and improved tools in just seventeen days, and the work efficiency was generally increased from 6.3 *fang* to 20 *fang*.

The project to build and develop the lake-bottom river happened to progress to the deepest part of the lake center when the wind and snow were raging. The Party Committee decided to organize a thousand-person shock brigade, absorbing physically strong party members, league members and young activists to participate, led by Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, Comrade Hu Pengfei. Supply, marketing, medical and other departments sent people to the construction site to directly serve the people digging the river. The heroes of the assault team were full of fighting spirit, and put forward the bold slogan of "using tofu (referring to thin mud) to build high walls, and using scrap iron to refine pure steel." The young men rolled up their trouser legs and broke the ice to go into the water, and the girls also tucked their coats into their waists and insisted on competing with their opponents. Comrade Hu Pengfei, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, also fought in the mud and water all day long. After two and a half days of hard fighting, they finally opened up the most difficult section of the river channel in the heart of the lake, 1,800 meters long, draining all the water accumulated in the lake.

Lake Bottom Turns into Granary

The sign in front of the Jinpen Lake Enclosure Command has been replaced with a sign reading "High-Yield Rice Production Command."

Because the state has built a large sluice gate on the Huayang River, which is connected to the heart-of-the-lake river, which can prevent the backflow of river water, because there are relatively strong water-lifting dams built around the lake in previous years to prevent the inflow of external water, because smooth drainage ditches and sluice gates have been built at both ends of the heart-of-the-lake river, and because the commune's mechanical drainage and irrigation station is located along the southeast of the lake, Jinpen Lake has finally completely escaped the threat of internal flooding. In May of this year, there was a heavy rain of 270 mm in two hours, and the water depth on the ground was one *chi*, but Jinpen Lake was not harmed. This fact powerfully proves that the Jinpen "jiao" dragon has been completely subdued. The land in the heart of Jinpen Lake can be free from waterlogging, and the land by the lake is of course even more guaranteed. In addition to enclosing Jinpen Lake, the commune opened up more than 30,000 *mu* of land in Jiguan Lake, Qingcao Lake, East, West, and Central Lakes from last winter to this spring.

Through the development of Jinpen Lake, the horizons of the commune members have been broadened, and they have received a very profound education in the idea that man can conquer nature. Wu Xiaoxiang, Secretary of the General Branch of the Huayang Brigade, made the following summary when recalling this past battle experience: "In the past few months, we have not only opened up the Jinpen Lake on the earth, but also opened up the Jinpen Lake in our minds!".

    金盆湖骤变
    ——记华阳人民公社围垦金盆湖的成就	本报记者　汪钦　冯武生	望江县华阳公社编写组
    这是发生在安徽省望江县华阳人民公社的一个故事：去年夏天，离华阳人民公社三百多华里的无为县，有个名叫李琪胜的老人，在华阳公社的金盆湖捕了很多的鱼，老人很高兴；今年这个时候，老人又约集本乡四五个同伴，带着网具，来到金盆湖。可是，他们到湖边上一看，原来的一片白茫茫湖水，如今竟变成一片绿色的稻海了！这个神奇的变化，使他们大吃一惊。
                金盆湖新貌
    盛夏的一天，我们随着华阳公社党委副书记、金盆湖水稻丰产指挥部负责人李知敬同志，参观了今天的金盆湖。站在指挥部附近的抬水坝上，看到眼前的景象，实在无法按捺内心的激动：乌黑油绿的水稻，迎风翻滚，很像一床无边的绿色锦被。长达八千多米的“幸福河”从东而西横贯湖心，宽阔平坦的“长青路”又纵贯湖心，在由“幸福河”与“长青路”纵横切开的四大片稻海里，有密如蛛网的大小沟渠；在这些河道、沟渠里，荷花正在盛开，很像是无数条鲜艳的彩带绣在这床无边的绿色锦被上。我们沿着“长青路”向过去的湖心行进，湖边的早稻已经收过了，现在又插上了双季晚稻。继续前进，便看到了大面积单季晚稻，棵棵都有碗口粗，二尺多高，社员们正在田里耘草。我们来到“幸福河”与“长青路”交错处的一座桥上，李书记兴奋地指着桥上一个大“金”字说：“这就是我们才修起的‘金桥’，这个地方也就是过去的湖心，它比临近长江的水面还要低两米。现在，我们要让湖心献出粮食！”在回去的路上，李书记还向我们介绍了他们计划怎样利用河网发展养鱼业（现已放鱼九百二十五万多尾）和家禽业，怎样管理和利用各沟渠的荷花、全面美化金盆湖等等。李书记还告诉我们，有些老年人来到金盆湖，看到这里长起了这样一大片好稻子，甚至感动得流出了眼泪。大号大队有位周老汉，在开河竣工的庆祝大会那天，他自动走上讲台，提议把湖心河定名为“幸福河”，把大公路定名为“长青路”。这就是这条河和这条路的名字的来源。
              奇妙的传说
    地处江边湖畔的华阳地区，解放前，一到涨水时即江湖不分，一片汪洋。这地方是大雨大涝，小雨小淹，不雨即旱，收成没有保障；再加上地主与反动政府的残酷剥削和压榨，群众生活极为悲惨。有一首歌谣唱道：春天靠草（打湖草），秋天靠柴（打芦柴），江里去，湖里来（打鱼）！”这里的农业收成是这样地可怜：“磨刀收割一餐饱，刀把一放就讨饭！”解放以后，在党的领导下大力治水，在控制水害方面取得了重大的胜利。但是，灾难根源之一的金盆湖还没有被连根拔掉，遇有大水时，它仍旧像一条蛟龙似地漫淹湖周的几万亩良田。
    关于金盆湖，老年人都记着这样一个传说：很早很早以前，金盆湖是一个什么都出产的“聚宝盆”。可是，后来湖里来了一条蛟龙，它每年夏天要朝拜龙王，而每次朝拜，都要搅得天昏地暗，雷雨交加，湖水高时过丈，少时也有三尺余，沿湖几十里，寸草皆无。据父老们说，金盆湖是由于湖型像个盆而得名。湖周圩区形成以前，湖内水深数丈，圩区围成以后，全圩高处一百多平方公里的水，便从四面八方注入湖中，年年冲积，湖床渐渐淤塞，蓄水量缩小，便经常泛滥成灾。
    解放后，沿湖人民不再信什么关于蛟龙的迷信传说了。有些人开始在湖边围垦了一些土地，可是他们所付出的劳动，多半没有换来应得的报酬，有时甚至白干了。华阳大队总支副书记徐礼德在公社化前四下金盆湖的经过，是沿湖人民同金盆这条“蛟龙”进行艰苦斗争的一个缩影。徐礼德第一次到金盆，是二十多年以前被他父亲用稻箩担去的。当时的金盆湖是“春牧牛羊冬宿雁，夏秋白水接蓝天。”由于湖水连年泛滥，那时不仅收不好庄稼，一家人还险些把生命丢在湖里。解放后，徐礼德担任互助组组长。那年，约了四户邻居二下金盆，在湖边围了二十八亩地，种上了庄稼，但当秧苗一片乌绿的时候，一场夏汛就给淹个溜光。1955年办起了初级社，徐礼德担任社长，又带领几十名社员三下金盆湖，这次力量大了些，一举开了七十亩荒，并围上了小胡子埂。可是当年5月下旬遇上几场大雨，尽管社员冒雨排涝抢救，结果还是大部分圩田被淹了。这年秋，高级社成立了，徐礼德带领更多的社员四下金盆湖，这次对邻近他们社的湖田作了较全面的规划，圩围得高，沟也开得很深，又开垦了二百多亩地。过了年，社员们满高兴地种上了稻子。可是这年又遇上了内涝，洪水冲破了围坝。他率领三百多个社员同洪水拼命地搏斗了七昼夜，把大部分稻子保住了，但终因秧苗受伤过重，而没有收到很多粮食。徐礼德深深地感到：一个高级社的力量还是太小了。
              书记探湖心
    金盆湖沿岸的人民终于在党的领导下，凭借着人民公社的威力，在短短的六个月时间内，把为害多年的“蛟龙”制服了，成了名副其实的金盆湖。
    “向金盆湖进军，向金盆湖要粮！”这是华阳公社党委会，在去年秋天认真地研究了县委的“大举向荒湖滩进军”、“要变荒湖为米粮川”的号召以后作出的大胆的决定。1958年以后，这个公社湖区前后曾经开通了大小沟渠五千六百七十多条，新建了两座排灌闸。在金盆湖四周修起了八千多米长的合成圩排灌道，使全社八万多亩地的用水有了保证。但是，在合成圩正中心的金盆湖却还没有完全得到根治。要根本改善自然条件，首先就得把金盆湖围垦起来。
    近几年来，由于国家、公社在金盆湖四周大修水利，已使金盆“蛟龙”的狂暴本性受到很大约束。公社在金盆湖四周修起合成圩和排水沟后，外水内流的现象已基本上制止了；国家在华阳河上修建起华阳大闸以后，不仅控制了江水倒灌，也使金盆湖水的水位大大降低了。公社建立以来，由于购进了十二台拖拉机、二台康拜因以及其他许多机器，因此能够腾出一部分劳动力来治湖垦荒。公社党委在研究了以上的情况以后，认为大干一冬春，完全可能使金盆湖根本改观。
    公社党委围垦金盆湖的决定，体现了沿湖人民多年梦寐以求的愿望，受到了广大社员的支持。在公社中很快掀起了一个报名参加治湖的高潮。不久，一支由四千多人组成的龙飞虎跃的大军，开到了金盆湖边。
                大战湖底河
    去年12月20日，挖湖底河的斗争开始了。这是整个治湖工程的第一战，也是决定治湖成败的一战。不首先挖通湖底河，湖里的存水就排不出去，其他围田等工程也就无从着手。因此，工地指挥部采取了“全面开花”与“分段集中突击”相结合的措施。沿湖四围，营寨相连，红旗招展；机械排灌站的马达，在湖的东南角日夜轰鸣。八个中队的四千健儿展开了火热的你追我赶的竞赛热潮。由曾经四下金盆湖的老将徐礼德率领的华阳治湖中队，一鼓干劲占了先；接着，白沙中队又赶过了华阳队。你追我赶，互不相让。华阳队与杨长队在公社化前，是隔湖相望的两个高级社。那时，它们曾为围圩放水发生过多次争吵；现在，大家在一个公社里，同甘共苦，改造自然。杨长中队李书记看到多次占先的华阳队，遇上了一段最难开的烂泥路，工效迅速下降时，便马上调集本队队员前去支援。在杨长队和其他几个队的支援下，这段路很快地就被突破了。
    河道越挖越深，工程越来越困难。由于社员们成天活动在没腿或没腰深的泥水里，活动在有很多带刺的荷茎和菱角的泥水里，工效开始降低，人们心里十分焦急。于是，公社党委便组织各队大搞工具改革，大搞技术革新。泥水行走不便，华阳队就来了个“旱地行舟”，结果，全队平均日工效由三方突增到三十八方；接着，新农林中队又改装成功了绳索牵拖泥机，使日工效跃到了八十六方的最高纪录。这样，全工地仅十七天，就推广使用了两万四千五百多件新工具和改良工具，使工效普遍由六点三方提高到二十方。
    兴修开发湖底河的工程，正好在风雪交加的时候，进展到湖水最深的湖中心时，党委决定组织千人突击队，吸收身体强健的党团员和青年积极分子参加，由党委副书记胡鹏飞同志率领突击。供销、医疗等部门都派人上工地，直接为挖河的人们服务。突击队的英雄们斗志昂扬，提出了“要用豆腐（指稀泥）砌高墙，要用废铁炼纯钢”的豪壮口号。小伙子们卷起裤腿就破冰下水，姑娘们也把外衣扎在腰里，同自己的对手坚持竞赛。党委副书记胡鹏飞，也整天战斗在泥水里。经过两天半的苦战，终于把湖心河中的一段一千八百米长的最难开的河道打通了，使湖里积存的水全部排了出去。
                湖底变粮仓
    金盆湖围垦指挥部门前，已经换上写有“水稻高额丰产指挥部”的牌子了。
    由于国家在与湖心河相通的华阳河上修有可以防止江水倒流的大闸，由于沿湖四周有去年以前修建的较为坚固的抬水坝可以阻止外水内流，由于在湖心河两端都修有顺畅的排水沟与闸门，以及湖的东南沿又有公社的机械排灌站等等，金盆湖终于完全摆脱了内涝的威胁。今年5月，曾发生一次两小时降雨二百七十毫米的大雨，平地水深一尺，但金盆湖内却未受害。这个事实有力地证明金盆“蛟龙”是被彻底地制服了。金盆湖心的地都可以不涝，湖边地当然就更有保证了。这个公社去冬今春除了围垦金盆湖以外，还在鸡冠湖，青草湖，东、西、中湖等地，开了三万多亩地。
    通过开发金盆湖，社员们的眼界扩大了，受到了一次极为深切的人定胜天的教育。华阳大队党总支书记吴晓香在回忆过去的这一段战斗经历时，做了这样的概括：“几个月来，不只是打开了大地上的金盆湖，也打开了我们思想上的金盆湖！”。
