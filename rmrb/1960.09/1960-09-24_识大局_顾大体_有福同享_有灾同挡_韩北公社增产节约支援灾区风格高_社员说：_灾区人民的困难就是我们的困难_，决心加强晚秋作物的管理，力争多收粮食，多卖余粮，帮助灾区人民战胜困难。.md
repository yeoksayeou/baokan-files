Understanding the Big Picture, Considering the Overall Situation, Sharing Blessings, and Sharing Disasters
Hanbei Commune's High Style of Increasing Production and Practicing Economy to Support Disaster Areas.
    Commune members said: "The difficulties of the people in the disaster areas are our difficulties." They are determined to strengthen the management of late autumn crops, strive to harvest more grain, sell more surplus grain, and help the people in the disaster areas overcome difficulties.
    According to a report in the Shanxi Daily, Hanbei People's Commune in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, is carrying out an in-depth campaign to increase production and practice economy, actively supporting the people in disaster areas to overcome the famine with the noble style of communism and practical actions.
    Hanbei Commune overcame drought this year, increased wheat production in the summer, and autumn crops are generally growing well. Since the Party's instructions on carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel were publicized and implemented, the Commune Party Committee, in the publicity and education of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, in addition to talking about the current excellent situation, also organized the broad masses of commune members and cadres to conduct debates through recollection and comparison. The questions debated were: What is the relationship between prosperous and disaster areas? Is there room for increasing production and practicing economy? Should we practice economy when we have a good harvest? In the debate, the commune members of the Qiaonan Management District said: Last year, our management district suffered a major disaster that had not been seen in twenty years. After the autumn harvest, we had no way to arrange our lives. The state provided 720 yuan and 80,000 catties of grain to help us through the disaster. This year, we have a bumper year, but many places across the country and the province have suffered disasters. How can we only care about ourselves and not others? The difficulties of the people in the disaster areas are our difficulties. Finally, everyone unanimously proposed to save money, sell an extra 130,000 catties of surplus grain from the entire management district this year to support the people in the disaster areas and support national construction. Han Hu, a poor peasant commune member from the Yaoshanggou Management District, said: "Our current life is much better than when we only had bran and vegetables for half a year before liberation. We cannot forget the pain once the sore is healed. I don't think there is a limit to increasing production, and there is also no limit to practicing economy." After recalling the past, comparing, and debating, all the cadres and commune members further realized the significance of increasing production and practicing economy, and unanimously expressed that they would consider the overall situation, understand the big picture, think for the 650 million people across the country, save money themselves, live frugally even when they are well-off, and save more grain to support the people in the disaster areas. On this basis, the commune formulated a plan for increasing production and practicing economy and a plan for selling more surplus grain.
    How to increase production and practice economy? Based on the opinions of the masses and in the spirit of combining immediate and long-term interests, the Hanbei Commune Party Committee decided:
    First, concentrate superior forces, make a big effort in the "three autumns," ensure that the autumn planting area is not reduced by a single point, no grain is lost in the autumn harvest, and no plow is missed in the autumn plowing. In terms of autumn planting, we must plant more and better wheat. In addition to ensuring the planting of 11,500 mu of main crop and catch crop wheat, we must also reclaim wasteland and increase planting. At the same time, we will use 6,500 mu of main crop wheat fields to intercrop vegetables, and use the autumn field empty season (from the end of the autumn harvest to the start of spring plowing and sowing next year) to plant 1,200 mu of spring vegetables, ensuring that each person plants one-tenth of a mu of vegetables and half a mu of rapeseed, so that each person can harvest 200 catties of vegetables in the spring and 4 catties of rapeseed in the summer next year. In terms of the autumn harvest, we must continue to manage late autumn crops and vegetable fields well, and strive to increase grain by 10% and vegetables by 20%; do a good job in protecting the autumn harvest, preventing wind, preventing floods, preventing frost, preventing damage, preventing loss, and preventing sabotage, ensuring that each mu increases grain by 3 catties; at the same time, we must comprehensively overhaul grain storage and vegetable cellars, ensuring that not a single grain rots during storage and no vegetable seedlings are damaged.
    Second, collect wild plants in a big way, vigorously develop agricultural by-products, and dry more vegetables. With the harvest of autumn crops, all by-products containing a large amount of starch, such as yam, sweet potato vines, corn husks, corn cobs, and sunflower disks, must be collected and managed well; launch a small autumn harvest campaign, with each person increasing their income by ten yuan and ten catties of substitute foods.
    Third, be meticulous in planning and careful in spending. Implement planned grain consumption, and adjust it appropriately according to the season, eating more during busy farming seasons and less during slack farming seasons.
    Through democratic discussion and the formulation of a plan to increase production and practice economy, a vigorous and solid campaign to increase production and practice economy has rapidly unfolded throughout the commune. The entire commune organized 80% of the labor force and invested it in the tense wheat sowing, and 20% of the labor force harvested early autumn crops and vigorously carried out the late processing of late autumn crops. The elderly and children, and other auxiliary labor forces, actively collected wild plants. In the past five days, the entire commune has renovated 6,500 mu of wheat fields, sown 1,500 mu, intercropped all of them with spinach, and harvested more than 800 mu of early-maturing crops; collected more than 600,000 catties of various wild vegetables; and collected 52,000 catties of wild plants, worth more than 60,000 yuan, with an average of five yuan per person.

　　韩北公社增产节约支援灾区风格高
    社员说：“灾区人民的困难就是我们的困难”，决心加强晚秋作物的管理，力争多收粮食，多卖余粮，帮助灾区人民战胜困难。
    据山西日报消息　山西武乡县韩北人民公社深入开展增产节约运动，以共产主义的崇高风格和实际行动，积极支援灾区人民生产度荒。
    韩北公社今年战胜了干旱，夏季小麦增了产，秋作物又普遍生长良好。自从党的关于开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动的指示宣传贯彻以后，公社党委在增产节约运动的宣传教育中，除大讲当前大好形势以外，还组织广大社员和干部，通过回忆对比，开展了辩论。辩论的问题是：丰产区和灾区的关系是什么？增产节约是不是到顶，有没有搞头？丰收了应该不应该节约？在辩论中，乔南管理区的社员们说：去年我们管理区遭受了二十年来没有过的特大灾害，秋后生活没法安排，国家救济了七百二十元钱，八万斤粮食，帮助我们度过了灾荒。今年我们是个丰收年，可是全国、全省有不少地方遭了灾，我们怎能光管自己，不管别人？灾区人民的困难就是我们的困难。最后，大家一致提出要自己省吃俭用，今年全管理区多卖余粮十三万斤，支援灾区人民，支援国家建设。窑上沟管理区贫农社员韩虎则说：“现在的生活，比解放前糠菜半年粮的时候强得多了，我们不能好了疮疤忘了疼。我看增产没到头，节约也没到顶。经过回忆对比、辩论以后，全体干部和社员进一步认识了增产节约的意义，一致表示要顾大体，识大局，为全国六亿五千万人民着想，自己省吃俭用，富日子穷过，省出更多的粮食，支援灾区人民。在此基础上，制定了全社增产节约计划和多卖余粮的计划。
    如何增产节约？韩北公社党委根据群众的意见，本着眼前利益和长远利益相结合的精神，决定：
    第一，集中优势兵力，大闹“三秋”，保证秋种面积分厘不少，秋粮收获颗粒不丢，秋耕土地一犁不漏。在秋种方面，要多种种好小麦，除保证种好一万一千五百亩正茬和赶茬小麦以外，还要开荒增种。同时利用六千五百亩正茬麦田间作青菜，利用秋田空季（从秋收结束到明年春耕播种开始）种春菜一千二百亩，保证每人种一分菜，半分油菜，明年春季每人收二百斤菜，夏季收四斤油菜籽。在秋收方面，要继续管好晚秋作物和菜田，力争增收一成粮、二成菜；做好保秋、护秋工作，防风、防涝、防霜、防损坏、防丢失、防破坏，保证每亩增收三斤粮；同时要全面检修粮仓、菜窖，保证储藏时不烂一粒粮，不损一株菜。
    第二，大采野生植物，大抓农业副产品，多晒干菜。随着秋作物的收获，要把山药、红薯蔓、玉米皮、玉米轴、葵花盘等含有大量淀粉的副产品全部收好管好；开展小秋收运动，每人增收十元钱和十斤代食品。
    第三，精打细算，细水长流。实行计划用粮，要根据季节适当调剂，农忙多吃，农闲少吃。
    通过民主讨论和制定增产节约计划，一个轰轰烈烈而扎扎实实的增产节约运动，便迅速在全社蓬勃展开。全社组织了80％的劳力，投入了紧张的小麦播种，20％劳力收获早秋作物和大搞晚秋作物后期加工。老人和儿童等辅助劳力，则积极采积野生植物。最近五天，全社修整麦地六千五百亩，下种一千五百亩，并全部间作了菠菜，收回早熟作物八百多亩；采积各种野菜六十多万斤；采积野生植物五万二千斤，价值六万多元，每人平均五元。
