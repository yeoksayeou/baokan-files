Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 14th: According to Soviet press reports, since the beginning of this year, Soviet coal miners have been continuously achieving new production successes. Judging from the national coal mine production achievements in the past few months, the Soviet Union's plan to produce 518 million tons of coal this year will be exceeded. Currently, Soviet coal miners are extracting more than 16 tons of coal for the country every second on average.

Throughout all coal mines and mining areas in the Soviet Union, a socialist emulation upsurge is boiling, striving to complete the Seven-Year Plan and this year's coal mining plan ahead of schedule. Thanks to the selfless labor of the coal miners, in the past few months, the national overall coal mining plan, as well as the coal mining plans of all major coal-producing regions, have been greatly overfulfilled. In the world-renowned, Soviet Union's largest Donbas coal region, in the first seven months of this year, miners over-fulfilled the plan by extracting more than 1.5 million tons of coal for the country. The coal miners of the Stalino Oblast there have now completed their socialist emulation guarantee for the entire year ahead of schedule, having over-fulfilled the plan by extracting more than 1 million tons of coking coal for the country. The miners of the Soviet Union's second-largest coal region, the Kuzbass coal region (in Siberia), have also made outstanding contributions to the country. In the first seven months, they over-fulfilled the original plan by extracting more than 500,000 tons of coal. Taking the overall national situation, the actual amount of coal mined in the first six months of this year exceeded the original target by 4.97 million tons. This is 670,000 tons more than the total amount of coal extracted over the plan for the entire year last year.

Since the beginning of this year, Soviet coal miners have created numerous outstanding production achievements and production records in the competition to overfulfill the national coal mining plan. In the Donbas coal region, in August, the world's highest record for shaft sinking was created using the "YKB-3.6" drilling rig, with a monthly drilling speed of up to 150 meters. In the Kuzbass coal region, the miners of the "Surdaikha" coal mine, due to improved production systems and the realization of production mechanization and automation, averaged 106.4 tons of coal mined per person in April, thereby creating the highest labor productivity record in the entire Soviet coal mining industry. In the labor history of the Soviet Union's third-largest coal region, the Karaganda coal region, equally glorious chapters have been added. The miners there created the highest daily coal mining record in March of this year – 100,000 tons. In July, the miners of the Kirov mine there created the highest labor productivity record in the history of the coal region. In this month, they averaged 100.2 tons of coal extracted for the country per person, 24 tons more than the original production target.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 13th: Workers and technicians in factories and mines in northern Korea are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Korean Workers' Party to fully launch a technological innovation movement and are launching a mass movement to mechanize and automate all processes. The workers of the Hwanghae Iron Works put forward more than 120 innovative suggestions in ten days, and the workshops have already started 20 reforms, some of which have been successful. The workers of this factory, in cooperation with technicians, have automated the process of mixing gas in blast furnaces and coke ovens. The Pyongyang Textile Machinery Factory has launched a movement of "one person, one invention." They have already selected more than 50 mechanization innovation projects.

In the technological innovation movement, the Heavy Industry Bureau of the Heavy Industry Committee has dispatched many technical cadres to various heavy machinery factories and has organized chief engineers and relevant cadres from various factories to guide and assist in the implementation of the thousands of innovation plans proposed by the workers. Due to the combination of technical personnel, leading cadres, and the masses of workers, more than a dozen heavy machinery factories, such as the Kumsong Mining Machinery Factory and the Ryongsong Machinery Factory, have completed most of the factory transport operations and the mechanization of some raw material production processes. The Pukjung Machinery Factory is laying dedicated railways and manufacturing various diesel locomotives, large cranes, molding machines, and sand mixers to achieve comprehensive mechanization of the sand casting and steel casting workshops in the first half of next year. After completing this work, the factory can save a lot of labor and increase labor productivity by more than 40%.

Workers in various factories and mines, developing the spirit of daring to think and daring to innovate, are constantly making significant inventions and creations in the technological innovation movement. Chon Jong-gil, a worker in the forging workshop of the Hamhung Machinery Factory, recently successfully trial-produced a horizontal forming machine, which has greatly contributed to the mechanization of screw production. Previously, it took three workers eleven minutes to make one screw; now, with this horizontal forming machine, one person can make five screws in one minute. The workers of the Chuuyl Flax Factory, who have made great contributions to the development of Korea's machinery industry, have invented an automatic fiber-making machine since September, which has become a major innovation in the Korean textile industry. It is fully automatic, from filling to fiber-making operations. Using two such automatic fiber-making machines to produce hemp fiber can save 60% of labor and greatly improve product quality.

The technological innovation movement in various factories and mines in Korea is developing extensively. Now, employees in the railway department, transportation department, and fisheries department are also taking action and actively launching technological innovation movements.

    苏联今年产煤五亿多吨的计划将超额完成
    矿工投入超额生产的竞赛热潮
    朝厂矿掀起使各工序机械化自动化的群众运动
    据新华社莫斯科14日电　据苏联报刊报道，今年以来，苏联煤矿工人不断创造新的生产成绩。从过去几个月全国煤矿的生产成就来看，苏联今年生产五亿一千八百万吨煤的计划将能超额完成。现在，苏联煤矿工人平均每秒钟就可以为国家开采十六吨以上的煤。
    在苏联各地所有的煤矿和采煤场都在沸腾着争取提前完成七年计划和今年采煤计划的社会主义竞赛热潮。由于煤矿工人的忘我劳动，在过去几个月中，全国总的采煤计划以及各重要产煤区的采煤计划，都大大超额完成了。在世界驰名的、苏联最大的顿巴斯煤区，今年头七个月矿工们就超计划为国家多开采了一百五十多万吨煤。那里的斯大林诺州的煤矿工人现在已经提前完成了他们今年全年的社会主义竞赛保证；超计划为国家多开采了一百多万吨炼焦煤。苏联第二大煤区——库兹巴斯煤区（在西伯利亚）的矿工也为国家作出了出色的贡献。他们在头七个月中超过原定计划多开采了五十多万吨煤。拿全国总的情况来看，今年头六个月内实际达到的采煤量，就比原定任务多出四百九十七万吨。这比去年全年超计划开采的煤的总量还多六十七万吨。
    今年以来，苏联煤矿工人在争取超额完成国家采煤计划的竞赛中，创造了不少出色的生产成就和生产纪录。在顿巴斯煤区，8月间，用“YKB—3·6”型钻进装置创造了竖井掘进世界最高纪录，全月掘进速度高达一百五十延米。在库兹巴斯煤区，“苏尔达伊哈”煤矿的矿工由于改进了生产制度、实现了生产机械化和自动化，在4月间平均每个人采煤一百零六点四吨，从而创造了全苏采煤工业劳动生产率的最高纪录。在苏联第三大煤区——卡拉干达煤区的劳动史册中，同样增添了光荣的篇章。那里的矿工在今年3月间创造了每昼夜采煤量的最高纪录——十万吨。7月间，那里的基洛夫矿井的矿工又创造了本煤区有史以来最高的劳动生产率纪录。他们在这一月平均每人为国家采煤一百点二吨，比原订生产指标多二十四吨。
    新华社平壤13日电　朝鲜北部各厂矿企业的工人和技术人员，热烈响应朝鲜劳动党关于全面展开技术革新运动的号召，展开了使各个工序机械化、自动化的群众性运动。黄海制铁所的工人，在十天内提出了一百二十多条革新建议，各车间已经着手进行二十项改革，其中一部分已经成功。这个厂的工人同技术人员合作，使混合高炉和炼焦炉的煤气的工序自动化了。平壤纺织机械制造厂掀起了“一个人提一件发明创造”的运动。他们已经选定了五十多项机械化的革新项目。
    在技术革新运动中，重工业委员会重型机械管理局向各重型机械工厂派遣了不少技术干部，同时组织各工厂的总工程师和有关干部，为实现工人们提出的几千件革新方案进行指导和帮助。由于技术人员、领导干部和工人群众结合在一起，龟城矿山机械工厂、龙城机械工厂等十几个重型机械厂已经完成了大部分的厂内搬运作业和一些生产毛坯的工序机械化。北中机械工厂为在明年上半年实现翻砂、铸钢车间综合机械化，正在厂内铺设专用铁路和制造各种柴油机车、大吊车、造型机、翻砂机等。完成这个工作后，这个厂可以节约许多劳动力，还能使劳动生产率提高40％以上。
    各厂矿企业中的工人发扬敢想敢干、大胆革新的精神，在技术革新运动中不断作出重大发明创造。咸兴机械制造所锻造车间工人全钟吉最近试制成功的横式压型机，对生产螺丝的机械化起了很大作用，以前做一个螺丝需要三个工人做十一分钟，现在用这种横式压型机，一个人一分钟可以做五个螺丝。为朝鲜的机械工业发展曾经作出巨大贡献的朱乙亚麻工厂的工人，9月份以来又发明了成为朝鲜纺织工业一大革新的自动制纤机。它从填料直到制纤作业都是自动的。用两台这种自动制纤机生产麻纤维，可以节约60％的劳动力，还能大大提高产品质量。
    朝鲜各厂矿企业的技术革新运动正在广泛地向前发展，现在铁路部门、交通运输部门和水产部门的职工也行动起来，积极展开技术革新运动。
