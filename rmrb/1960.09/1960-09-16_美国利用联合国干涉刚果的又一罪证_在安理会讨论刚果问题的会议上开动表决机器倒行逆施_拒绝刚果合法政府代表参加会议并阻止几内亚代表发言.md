Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 15th: The United Nations Security Council, at the request of the Soviet delegation, reconvened yesterday to discuss the situation in the Congo.

Prior to this, the Security Council had held a meeting on September 9 to discuss the Congo issue. That meeting, under the manipulation of the United States on September 12, passed a resolution indefinitely postponing the discussion of the Congo issue under the pretext of the so-called "chaotic" situation in the Congo. At the same time, the United States, through the "UN forces" and the UN representatives in the Congo, intensified its activities in the Congo, attempting to overthrow Lumumba's legitimate government and replace it with a traitorous government that would rely on imperialism. Before yesterday's meeting, at the suggestion of the President of the Security Council, Italian representative Ortona, representatives from Guinea, Ghana, Morocco, Indonesia, and Yugoslavia were invited to attend the meeting.

Kasavubu and Congo Republic Prime Minister Lumumba respectively dispatched Bomboko and Kanza to represent the Congo at the meeting.

During the discussion of which representative should be invited to attend the meeting, Soviet representative Zorin suggested inviting Kanza, the representative of the legitimate government of the Congo, to attend the meeting.

The Western countries, headed by the United States, strongly opposed inviting the representative of the legitimate government of the Congo to attend the meeting. U.S. representative Wadsworth declared in the tone of a colonialist that important issues could be resolved without them. He proposed the adoption of an informal agreement not to invite any Congo delegation to participate. When a vote was taken on the question of inviting a Congo representative to attend the meeting, the Soviet Union, Poland, and Ceylon voted in favor of inviting the representative of the legitimate government of the Congo, while other representatives abstained, resulting in the proposal being effectively rejected because seven votes were required for the resolution to pass.

The Western countries' representatives, headed by the United States, also rudely prevented the representative of Guinea, who was invited to attend the meeting, from speaking on the issue of Congo representatives attending the meeting, using the excuse that Guinea was not a member of the Security Council. Representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland, Ceylon, and Tunisia supported the Guinean representative's request. Sir Koria, the representative of Ceylon, pointed out that Security Council President Ortona had just allowed the Yugoslav representative to speak before the Guinean representative requested to speak, while Yugoslavia was also not a member of the Security Council. Soviet representative Zorin pointed out that the Security Council should treat African countries fairly. He made a formal request, advocating that the representative of Guinea be invited to speak.

Under this righteous questioning, the Western countries, headed by the United States, finally had to resort to their voting machine. The results of the vote on this issue were: four votes in favor (Soviet Union, Poland, Ceylon, Tunisia), two abstentions (Ecuador, Argentina), and the United States, Britain, France, Italy, and Chiang Kai-shek's followers voted against.

Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin, speaking first at the meeting held last night, pointed out that the situation in the Congo was very tense, and this situation harbored a direct threat to international peace and the security of Africa.

The Soviet representative listed a large number of conclusive facts to illustrate the shameful role played by the United Nations Command in the Congo and the United Nations Secretary-General himself. He said that Hammarskjöld was blatantly working for the colonialists. The countries of the North Atlantic military bloc, headed by the United States, are colluding to oppose the independence and territorial integrity of this young African country. They are trying to prevent the Congo from completely breaking free from colonial rule, thereby maintaining their control over the country's extremely rich natural resources. All the actions of these countries' representatives in the Security Council demonstrate that their policy towards the Congo is entirely for this purpose.

Zorin then stressed that the colonialists are doing everything possible to overthrow the Congolese government led by Lumumba, because this government is doing its best to consolidate the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of the Congo.

The Soviet representative finally said that the Security Council must immediately and without delay take measures to stop any form of interference in the Congo's internal affairs. The legitimate government of the Republic of the Congo should be granted the power to exercise sovereignty over the entire territory of the Congo.

The meeting adjourned after the Tunisian representative spoke and will continue on September 15.

    美国利用联合国干涉刚果的又一罪证
    在安理会讨论刚果问题的会议上开动表决机器倒行逆施
    拒绝刚果合法政府代表参加会议并阻止几内亚代表发言
    新华社15日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会应苏联代表团的要求，昨天重新开会，讨论刚果局势问题。
    在这以前，安全理事会曾经在9日举行会议，讨论刚果问题。那次会议于12日在美国操纵下通过决议，以所谓刚果局势“混乱不堪”为借口，无限期地延期讨论刚果问题。在此同时，美国通过“联合国军”和联合国在刚果的代表在刚果加紧活动，企图推翻卢蒙巴的合法政府代之一个投靠帝国主义的卖国政府。在昨天的会议开会之前，根据安理会主席、意大利代表奥托纳的建议，邀请了几内亚、加纳、摩洛哥、印度尼西亚和南斯拉夫的代表出席了会议。
    卡萨武布和刚果共和国总理卢蒙巴分别派遣了邦博科和坎扎代表刚果去参加会议。
    在讨论应该邀请哪个代表出席时，苏联代表佐林建议邀请刚果合理政府的代表坎扎出席这次会议。
    以美国为首的西方国家极力反对邀请刚果合法政府代表出席会议。美国代表韦兹沃斯以殖民主义者的腔调宣称，重要的问题没有他们也能解决。他提议通过一项非正式协议，不邀请任何刚果代表团参加。在就邀请刚果代表参加会议的问题进行表决时，苏联、波兰和锡兰投票赞成邀请刚果合法政府的代表参加，其他代表都弃权，结果此议案等于遭到否决。因为要有七票赞成才能通过决议。
    以美国为首的西方国家代表还蛮横地阻止被邀请出席会议的几内亚代表就刚果代表参加会议问题发言的要求，他们借口说，几内亚不是安理会的理事。苏联、波兰、锡兰和突尼斯的代表支持几内亚代表的要求。锡兰代表科里亚爵士指出，安理会主席奥托纳刚刚在几内亚代表要求发言之前还允许南斯拉夫代表发言，而南斯拉夫也不是安理会理事。苏联代表佐林指出，安理会应该公平地对待非洲国家。他提出一项正式要求，主张邀请几内亚的代表发言。
    在这种义正词严的质问下，以美国为首的西方国家最后只好乞灵于它们的投票机器。关于这个问题的表决结果是：四票赞成（苏联、波兰、锡兰、突尼斯），两票弃权（厄瓜多尔、阿根廷），美、英、法、意大利和蒋介石分子投票反对。
    苏联外交部副部长佐林在昨天晚间举行的会议上首先发言指出，刚果的局势非常紧张，这种局势对国际和平和非洲的安全蕴藏着直接的威胁。
    苏联代表列举了大量确凿的事实，来说明联合国驻刚果军队司令部以及联合国秘书长本人所扮演的可耻角色。他说，哈马舍尔德明目张胆地为殖民主义者工作。以美国为首的北大西洋军事集团国家正在串通一气反对这个年轻的非洲国家的独立和领土的完整。他们企图阻止刚果彻底摆脱殖民主义者的统治，从而维持他们对这个国家的极丰富的天然资源的控制。这些国家的代表在安理会上的一切行动都说明，他们对刚果的政策全是为了这个目的。
    佐林接着强调指出，殖民主义者正在千方百计地想要推翻以卢蒙巴为首的刚果政府，因为这个政府正在竭尽全力来巩固刚果共和国的独立和领土完整。
    苏联代表最后说，安理会必须立即、毫不怠慢地采取措施，制止对刚果内政的任何形式的干涉。刚果共和国的合法政府应该得到在整个刚果领土上行使主权的权力。
    会议在突尼斯代表发言后休会到9月15日继续开会。
