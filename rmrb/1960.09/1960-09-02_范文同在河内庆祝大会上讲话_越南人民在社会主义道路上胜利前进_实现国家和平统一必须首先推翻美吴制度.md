Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 1st: Premier Pham Van Dong delivered a lengthy speech at the celebration rally in Hanoi today marking the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In this speech, discussing the August Revolution and the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, he touched upon the past fifteen years of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; holding high the banner of peaceful reunification of the fatherland; advancing towards building socialism in North Vietnam; and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the world.

Premier Pham Van Dong said, "Since the birth of our Party, it has firmly grasped the leadership of the revolution and guided our people along the socialist road throughout the entire national democratic revolution."

After recounting the heroic historical facts of the Vietnamese people in the long war of resistance, Premier Pham Van Dong said: "Our people's arduous, long-term, and vigorous war of resistance is a great victory for our people and the people's democratic regime under the leadership of the Party. Our people have proven that in today's world, a small and weak nation, as long as it unites closely and fights resolutely, has enough strength to defeat the invading imperialists. The oppressed nations of the world have gained valuable experience from our people's war of resistance. Our people have held high the banner of fighting against and defeating imperialist aggressors."

He continued, "The achievements of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam since the restoration of peace demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system. At present, the agriculture of the North, whether in terms of yield per unit area or calculated per capita, ranks first in Southeast Asia in all aspects. The output of some important sectors of Northern industry, calculated per capita, has already caught up with the more developed industrial countries in Southeast Asia. The average annual growth rate of agriculture in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is about 11%, and the growth rate of industry is 30%, which is a very high speed, far exceeding the average growth rate of Southeast Asian countries. In the North's education, if we take the proportion of primary and secondary school students and university students in the population, it is the most developed education in Southeast Asia."

He said, "The infinite strength of the people under the correct leadership of the Party headed by the respected President Ho Chi Minh is the source of the great achievements of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam over the past fifteen years." He said, "At the same time, we, the Vietnamese people, deeply realize that all our victories are inseparable from the rapid growth of the socialist camp; they are inseparable from the generous and invaluable assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal socialist countries."

Speaking about the issue of the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, Premier Pham Van Dong said, "At present, our country is temporarily divided into two parts, with two different political systems, the system in the North being a people's democratic system, and the system in the South being a new type of colonial and semi-feudal system."

He said, "Peaceful reunification is the revolutionary struggle of our entire people and our entire Vietnamese nation, and it will be the result of the cause of socialist construction in the North and the cause of national democratic revolution in the South."

He said, "Our people's confidence in the cause of unifying the fatherland is unwavering. No reactionary force can stop the cause of unifying the fatherland, and we will surely achieve victory in the cause of building a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam."

When speaking about advancing towards building socialism in North Vietnam, Premier Pham Van Dong said, "The general line of the socialist revolution in the North, proposed by our Party based on the characteristics of our country and combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, is: 'Unite the people of the whole country, carry forward the profound patriotic spirit, the tradition of courageous struggle, and hard work of our people, and at the same time strengthen international unity with all fraternal socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, so that the North will advance quickly, vigorously, and steadily towards socialism, build a new life in the North, consolidate the North as a solid base for the struggle to achieve national reunification, and contribute to strengthening the socialist camp and safeguarding peace in Southeast Asia and the world. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to use the people's democratic regime to carry out the historical task of the dictatorship of the proletariat, carry out socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, small commerce, and private capitalist industry and commerce; develop the state-owned economic sector, and realize socialist industrialization by rationally prioritizing the development of heavy industry while striving to develop agriculture and light industry; vigorously promote the socialist revolution in ideology, culture, and art, continuously improve the people's living standards, and build our country into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and advanced culture and science.'"

He said, "Based on the general line and the situation after the completion of the Three-Year Plan in the North, the first Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) will play an important role in advancing the socialist cause in the North to take a major step forward. The basic tasks of the first Five-Year Plan are as follows:
	(1) Vigorously develop industry and agriculture, initially realize the priority development of heavy industry, while vigorously developing comprehensive agriculture, developing the food industry and light industry, developing the transportation industry, and strengthening state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, in order to prepare the foundation for further making our country a socialist industrial and agricultural country.
	(2) Complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, small commerce, and private capitalist industry and commerce, consolidate and strengthen the state-owned economic sector, strengthen the relationship between ownership by the whole people and collective ownership, and expand socialist relations of production throughout the national economic structure.
	(3) Improve the people's cultural level and socialist consciousness, vigorously promote the training of economic construction cadres and skilled workers, improve the ability of cadres, workers, and working people to manage the economy; promote scientific and technological work, promote the exploration of natural resources and conduct basic surveys, serving the needs of socialist economic and cultural development.
	(4) Further improve the material and cultural life of the working people, so that our people can have enough to eat, wear warm clothes, have housing, and be able to study, expand public welfare undertakings, and establish a new life in rural and urban areas.
	(5) While combining economic development, we must vigorously strengthen national defense, strengthen social order, national security, and protect the socialist construction cause in the North."

He said, "The most prominent point of the Five-Year Plan is to initially realize socialist industrialization and promote the industrial and agricultural development of the entire national economy."

He said, "While developing industry, we must vigorously develop agriculture. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and the foundation for developing industry. This evaluation of the importance of agriculture is the result of our country's summary of experience in this regard."

Premier Pham said, "We will gradually and rationally arrange productive forces in our North, try our best to tap the potential of our country's resources and labor force, and vigorously and systematically promote the economic development of the plains, central plains, and mountainous areas."

He said, "In the coming five years, we will complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, small commerce, and private industry and commerce."

In the final part of his speech, Premier Pham Van Dong said, "Our country is a part of the world, and our revolutionary movement is a part of the world revolutionary movement. Over the past fifteen years, the transformation of our country's revolution has reflected the great transformation of the world revolution. In the process of their own revolutionary struggle, our people have continuously received the warm sympathy and support of the people of the world."

He said, "The Soviet Union's great victory in World War II paved the way for the revolutionary movements in many countries to enter a new stage." He cited the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the people's democratic countries in Eastern and Central Europe to illustrate that socialism has gone beyond the scope of one country and become a world system.

He pointed out, "The victory of the Chinese revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China have made socialism dominant in the balance of world forces. This is an infinitely important international event."

He said, "The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has rapidly developed its strength in all aspects and has gradually played a decisive role in the entire world situation. Due to the existence and firm support of the socialist camp, the power, scale, and speed of the national liberation movement are unprecedented. It has led to the disintegration of the colonial system, further weakening the imperialism that began to decay after the October Revolution and became even more corrupt after World War II. At the same time, the workers' class struggle movement in capitalist countries has also been greatly promoted under more favorable conditions than before. The people of the world are cooperating with the above-mentioned movements and, with the Soviet Union and the socialist camp as a strong pillar, are carrying out a struggle against the aggressive and provocative imperialism—especially U.S. imperialism. This struggle is to safeguard and consolidate world peace and is an infinitely great and important struggle."

He also said, "The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a member of the socialist camp in the Southeast Asian region. However, our South has been turned into a new type of colony and military base of U.S. imperialism by U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. The process of our people's revolutionary struggle is a struggle against aggressive imperialism and its lackeys, from the national and democratic revolution to the socialist revolution. Today, our people continue to struggle against the aggressive U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to safeguard peace, build socialism in the North, complete the national democratic revolution throughout the country, and peacefully unify the fatherland."

He said, "There is a saying in Vietnam: 'Beat it to death, its nature won't change.' Imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, is aggressive and warlike. The Vietnamese people clearly realize that their struggle against the aggression and provocation of U.S. imperialism, to safeguard peace, defend the socialist construction cause in the North, complete the national democratic revolution throughout the country, and realize the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, is an inseparable part of the world's ongoing struggle against imperialism and all reactionary forces, for peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism, which is an extremely great struggle."

He said, "Socialism is the cornerstone of this struggle, both in Vietnam and in the world. Therefore, the Vietnamese people are vigorously building socialism in the North and contributing to the consolidation of the unity between socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, a unity based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. At the same time, the Vietnamese people are working hard to strengthen friendship with nationalist countries in Asia and Africa, especially neighboring countries, and deeply sympathize with and fully support the booming national liberation movement around the world."

He emphasized, "Regarding the sinister and viciousness of the imperialists headed by the United States, just like the people of the world, the Vietnamese people have become more vigilant, hate them more, and strengthen their unity more to carry out the struggle to defeat them. Final victory must belong to our people."

Premier Pham Van Dong concluded by saying, "Our Party is the leader of our people's revolutionary cause, and the Party's line and policies play a very important role in our country's revolutionary cause. Therefore, our entire people are welcoming the upcoming Third National Congress of the Party with joy and excitement. The congress will mark a new progress in our people's revolutionary cause—building socialism in the North and realizing the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. The congress will powerfully encourage our people to bravely advance, complete new tasks, and strive for new victories. Under the Party's glorious banner, our entire people are determined to strengthen unity, vigorously promote socialist construction in the North, realize the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, realize a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam, and contribute to strengthening the socialist camp and defending peace in Southeast Asia and the world."

    范文同在河内庆祝大会上讲话
    越南人民在社会主义道路上胜利前进
    实现国家和平统一必须首先推翻美吴制度
    新华社河内1日电　范文同总理今天上午在越南民主共和国成立十五周年庆祝大会上发表了长篇讲话。他在这篇论述八月革命与越南民主共和国的成立的讲话中谈到了越南民主共和国过去的十五年；高举和平统一祖国的旗帜；为在越南北方建设社会主义而前进；越南民主共和国和世界等问题。
    范文同总理说，“自从我们党诞生以来，党就紧握了革命的领导权，并且在整个民族民主革命的过程中，引导我国人民沿着社会主义道路前进。”
    在举述了越南人民在长期抗战中的英勇史实之后，范文同总理说：“我国人民艰苦的、长期的和轰轰烈烈的抗战，是在党领导下的我国人民和人民民主政权的伟大胜利。我国人民已经证明了，今天世界上一个弱小民族，只要紧密团结、坚决战斗，就有足够力量击败侵略的帝国主义者。世界上被压迫的民族从我国人民的抗战中取得了宝贵的经验。我国人民已高举了同帝国主义侵略者进行战斗，并且战胜它们的旗帜。”
    他接着说：“越南民主共和国恢复和平以来的成就，显示了社会主义制度的优越性。目前北方的农业，无论从单位面积产量或按照人口平均计算，各方面都居东南亚的第一位。北方工业的一些重要部门的产量按照人口平均计算已经赶上东南亚工业较发达的国家。越南民主共和国的农业每年平均增产的速度约为11％，工业增产的速度为30％，这是很高的速度，它远远超过东南亚各国增产的平均速度。北方的教育，如果拿中、小学生，大学生人数在人口中的比例来说，那么，它是东南亚教育最发达的国家。”
    他说，“以敬爱的胡志明主席为首的党的正确领导下的人民的无穷无尽力量，是越南民主共和国十五年来取得伟大成就的源泉。”他说，“同时，我们越南人民深刻地体会到，我们的一切胜利与社会主义阵营的迅速壮大是分不开的；与苏联、中国以及社会主义其他各兄弟国家慷慨的、无比宝贵的援助，都是分不开的。”
    在讲到关于和平统一祖国的问题时，范文同总理说，“目前，我国暂时被分为两部分，有两个不同的政治制度，北方的制度是人民民主制度，南方的制度是新型的殖民地和半封建制度。”
    他说，“和平统一是我们全国人民和我们越南全民族的革命斗争，它将是北方社会主义建设事业和南方民族民主革命事业的结果。”
    他说，“我国人民对统一祖国事业的信心是坚定不移的，对统一祖国事业，是没有任何反动力量可以阻止的，并且我们在实现一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南事业中，是一定会得到胜利的。”
    范文同总理在讲到为在越南北方建设社会主义而前进的问题时说，“我们党从我国特点出发，结合马克思列宁主义的普遍真理而提出的北方社会主义革命的总路线是：‘团结全国人民，发扬我国人民浓厚的爱国精神，勇敢奋斗和辛勤劳动的传统，同时加强同以苏联为首的各个兄弟的社会主义国家的国际团结，使北方快、猛、稳地向社会主义前进，建设北方的新生活，巩固北方成为实现国家统一斗争的牢固基地，为加强社会主义阵营，为维护东南亚及世界和平作出贡献。为了达到这个目的，必须使用人民民主政权去执行无产阶级专政的历史任务，对农业、手工业、小商业和私营资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造；发展国营经济成分，在以合理地优先发展重工业，同时努力发展农业和轻工业的方法去实现社会主义工业化；大力推动思想、文化和艺术的社会主义革命，不断改善人民的生活，把我国建设成为一个拥有现代化工业、现代化农业以及先进的文化和科学的社会主义国家’。”
    他说，“根据总路线和北方完成三年计划后的情况，第一个五年计划（1961—1965年）将对推进北方社会主义事业向前跨进重要的一步而起作用。第一个五年计划的基本任务如下：
      （一）大力发展工业和农业，初步实现优先发展重工业，同时，大力发展全面的农业，发展食品工业和轻工业，发展交通运输业，加强国营商业和合作社商业，为进而使我国成为一个社会主义的工业和农业的国家准备好基础。
      （二）完成对农业、手工业、小商业和私营资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，巩固和增强国营经济成分，加强全民所有制及集体所有制之间的关系，在整个国民经济机构中扩大社会主义的生产关系。
      （三）提高人民的文化程度和社会主义觉悟，大力推进培养经济建设干部和熟练工人，提高干部、工人和劳动人民管理经济的能力；促进科学技术工作，促进对自然资源的勘探和进行基本调查工作，为着社会主义经济和文化发展的需求而服务。
      （四）进一步改善劳动人民的物质和文化生活，使我国人民能够吃饱、穿暖、有房屋居住和能够学习，扩大公共福利事业，在农村和城市建立新的生活。
      （五）与结合发展经济的同时，必须大力加强国防，加强社会秩序、国家安全、保卫北方的社会主义建设事业。”
    他说：“五年计划中最突出之点是初步实现社会主义工业化，推进全部国民经济的工业和农业发展。”
    他说，“随着发展工业的同时，我们必须大力发展农业。农业是国民经济的基础，是发展工业的基础，对农业的重要性的这一评价，是我国对这方面的经验总结的结果。”
    范总理说，“我们将在我国北方逐步地和合理地安排生产力，尽量发掘我国资源和劳动力等方面的潜力，大力和有步骤地推进平原、中原和山区经济的发展。”
    他说，“在将要来到的五年中，我们将完成对农业、手工业、小商业和私营工商业的社会主义改造。”
    范文同总理在谈到最后一部分时说，“我国是世界的一部分，我国革命运动是世界革命运动的一部分。十五年来，我国革命的转变，反映了世界革命的巨大转变。我国人民在自己革命的斗争过程中，不断地得到世界人民热烈的同情和支持。”
    他说，“苏联在第二次世界大战中的伟大胜利，为许多国家的革命运动转入新阶段开辟了道路。”他举出越南民主共和国和东欧和中欧各人民民主国家的成立的事实说明，社会主义已经超出了一国范围而成为世界体系。
    他指出，“中国革命的胜利，中华人民共和国的成立，使社会主义在世界力量的对比中占了优势，这是无限重大的国际事件。”
    他说，“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营迅速地从各方面发展了自己的力量，并逐渐对整个世界形势起了具有决定性的作用。由于社会主义阵营的存在和坚决的支持，民族解放运动发展的威力，规模和速度是史无前例的，它使殖民主义体系趋于瓦解，进一步削弱了在十月革命后开始腐朽、而在第二次世界大战后更加腐朽的帝国主义。与此同时，在资本主义国家中的工人阶级斗争运动在比以前更为顺利的条件下也有了大力的推进。全世界人民正在配合着上述的各种运动，并以苏联和社会主义阵营作为强有力的支柱，而进行了反对侵略和挑衅的帝国主义——尤其是美帝国主义的斗争，这个斗争是为了维护和巩固世界和平的是一个无限巨大和重要的斗争。”
    他又说，“越南民主共和国是社会主义阵营在东南亚地区的一个成员。但是，我国南方已被美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团变成为美帝国主义新型的殖民地和军事基地。我国人民革命斗争的过程，是反对侵略的帝国主义及其走狗、从民族和民主革命走向社会主义革命的斗争过程。今天我国人民继续为反对侵略的美帝国主义及其走狗而进行斗争，以维护和平，在北方建设社会主义和在全国范围内完成民族民主革命并和平统一祖国。”
    他说，越南有一句俗语说：“打到死，性不变”。帝国主义，尤其是美帝国主义是侵略和好战的。“越南人民清楚地认识到，自己所进行的反对美帝国主义的侵略挑衅，维护和平、保卫北方的社会主义建设事业，在全国范围内完成民族民主革命、实现和平统一祖国的斗争，就是世界上正在进行反对帝国主义和一切反动力量，为和平、民主、民族独立及社会主义的极其伟大的斗争的不可分隔的一部分。”
    他说，“社会主义就是这个斗争的柱石，在越南是这样，在世界也是这样。因此，越南人民大力在北方建设社会主义，并对巩固以苏联为首的社会主义各国之间的团结，在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的团结一致做出贡献。同时，越南人民正在努力加强同亚洲和非洲各民族主义国家，特别是各邻邦之间的友谊，并深切同情和全力支持全世界正在蓬勃发展的民族解放运动。”
    他强调说，“对于以美国为首的帝国主义者的凶险和恶毒，正如全世界人民一样，越南人民已更加提高警惕，更加憎恨他们，更加加强自己的团结，进行斗争以击败它们。最后胜利一定是属于我们人民的。”
    范文同总理最后说：“我们党是我国人民革命事业的领导者，党的路线、政策对我们全国革命事业有着十分重大的作用。因此，我们全国人民以愉快和兴奋的心情迎接即将来临的党的第三次全国代表大会，大会将标志着我国人民的革命事业——在北方建设社会主义和实现和平统一祖国事业的新进展。大会将有力地鼓舞我国人民奋勇前进，完成新的任务和争取新的胜利。在党的光辉旗帜下，我们全国人民决心加强团结，大力推进在北方的社会主义建设，实现祖国的和平统一，实现一个和平、统一、独立、民主与富强的越南，对加强社会主义阵营和保卫东南亚与世界和平作出贡献。”
