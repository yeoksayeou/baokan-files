Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Electric Dispatch: Leading cadres at all levels in Hunan Province have gone deep into the coal-rich Chenzhou area to participate in labor and direct transportation, resulting in a 7.5% increase in the amount of raw coal transferred out of the area in July compared to June. As of August 25, the coal transport volume increased by another 9.54% compared to the same period in July. Among them, the amount of raw coal transferred to other provinces in August increased by 1.13 times compared to the same period last month.

The coal transferred from Chenzhou Prefecture to other provinces accounts for a large proportion of the province's coal transfer task. The coal transferred from this area to Hubei, Shanghai, Fujian, Guangdong and other places is mostly prime coking coal and white coal. The CPC Hunan Provincial Committee and the Chenzhou Prefectural Committee attach particular importance to coal production and transportation in this area. Provincial Party Secretaries Li Ruishan and Yu Mingtao, as well as Chenzhou Prefectural Committee Secretary Hao Yi and other leading cadres, personally went to the coal transportation front line in this area to inspect coal transportation work and provide specific transportation guidance. They concentrated a large number of transportation workers, three hundred railway cars, 80% of the wooden sailing boats in the district, 60% of the automobiles, and a large number of cattle, horse carts, mine cars and other vehicles into coal transportation. The coal mines and transportation units were also led by the secretaries, organizing more than 800 cadres to go deep into the fleets, convoys, ports, and mines to participate in labor and lead production, and promptly solve the key problems in transportation. For example, the short-distance collection and transportation volume of the Xinshang Coal Mine could not keep up with the needs of long-distance transportation, which affected the transportation efficiency of long-distance transport vessels. After the leading cadres of the Provincial and Prefectural Committees discovered this problem, they immediately sent a mine director to live by the river to grasp transportation and rushed to repair a coal loading hopper with a capacity of more than 800 tons, reversing the phenomenon of sailing boats waiting for coal in the port. The Xiatang Work Area of ​​the Jiedong Coal Mine had more than 50,000 tons of accumulated coal. The mine party committee sent a deputy secretary and two deputy mine directors to personally work on the site, taking turns day and night with the workers to rush to install coal loading hoppers and repair roads, so that the collection and transportation volume of this work area quickly increased by two times. The Party Committee of the Prefectural Highway Transportation Bureau also moved the office, repair team, dispatch room, canteen, and medical clinic to the coal transportation front line. The secretary and director participated in rushing to repair hoppers and loading and unloading vehicles, promptly solving problems such as driving scheduling, vehicle maintenance, and highway maintenance. Leading cadres participating in labor greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers, and the loading and unloading time of coal transportation in the area was greatly shortened. The boatmen of the Leiyang and Yongxing Transportation Communes dredged shoals and dredged mud day and night during the dry season in July, deepening the water level of six main dangerous shoals to ensure smooth passage of ships. The loading and unloading workers vigorously promoted lubrication, which greatly improved the mechanization and semi-mechanization of coal transportation loading and unloading in the entire region, and the loading and unloading efficiency increased by one and a half times. The 3,000 loading and unloading workers that the entire district originally planned to increase not only did not need to be increased, but also saved 800 laborers. The water transport workers promoted the experience of increasing the buoyancy of ships, which increased the load of the ships by 15%, which is equivalent to increasing 2,000 tons of ships in the entire area.

    省委书记深入基层抓运煤
    湖南郴州地区供应上海等地的煤炭不断增加
    新华社长沙电　湖南省各级领导干部深入盛产原煤的郴州地区，参加劳动，指挥调运，使全区7月份调出的原煤比6月份增长7.5％，8月份截至25日止，煤运量又比7月同期增长9.54％，其中8月份调往外省的原煤比上月同期增长一点一三倍。
    郴州专区调给外省的煤炭，占全省外调煤炭任务很大比重。这个区调往湖北、上海、福建、广东等地的煤炭，大部分是主焦煤和白煤。中共湖南省委和郴州地委特别重视这个地区的煤炭生产和调运工作。省委书记李瑞山、于明涛和郴州地委书记郝毅等领导干部，都亲临这个地区的煤运前线检查煤运工作，具体指挥调运。他们在全区集中大批的运输职工，三百辆车皮和全区80％的木帆船，60％的汽车，以及大量的牛、马车、矿车等车辆，投入运煤工作。煤矿和运输单位，也由书记挂帅，组织八百多个干部深入船队、车队、港口、矿山，参加劳动和领导生产，及时解决调运中的关键问题。如新生煤矿矿内短途集运量赶不上长途运输的需要，影响长途运输船只的运输效率。省委、地委的领导干部发现这一问题以后，立即派了一个矿长住河边抓运输，抢修了一个容量八百多吨的装煤漏斗，扭转了帆船停港等煤的现象。街洞煤矿夏塘工区积存煤五万多吨，矿党委就派一副书记和两个副矿长亲自上工地，日夜轮班和职工一起突击安装装煤漏斗，整修公路，使这个工区集运量迅速提高了两倍。专区公路运输局党委把办公室、检修队、调度室、食堂、医疗所，也搬到煤运前线，书记、局长参加抢修漏斗和装车卸车，及时解决行车调度、车辆维修、公路维护等问题。领导干部参加劳动，大大鼓舞了职工的劳动热情，全区运煤的装卸时间大大缩短。耒阳、永兴两个运输公社的船工，在7月枯水季节，夜以继日地疏滩淘泥，加深六个主要滩险的水位，保证了船只畅通无阻。装卸职工大搞溜滑化，大大提高了全区煤运装卸机械化和半机械化程度，装卸效率提高了一倍半；全区原来计划需要增加的三千个装卸工人不但不要增加，而且还节约了八百个劳动力。水运职工推行了增加船舶浮力的经验，使船的载量增加15％，全区等于增加二千吨的船只。
