    Yang Huimin, a female weaving worker at the Shanghai Zhang Shoupu Cloth Factory, has been weaving for only five years, but she has not produced any substandard cloth for three years and one month consecutively. The output of the looms she manages is also the highest among the sixteen velvet factories in the city.

    Yang Huimin, who is twenty-three years old, has been able to maintain high quality and high yield for such a long time mainly because she has a high sense of responsibility as a master of the country. She constantly studies diligently in production practice, observes carefully, and has found a set of rules to avoid accidents and substandard cloth. Once, not long after she started her shift, a shuttle suddenly cracked, breaking many yarn ends. Yang Huimin felt very sad, feeling that she had not fulfilled her responsibility and had wasted the property of the country and the people. In order to avoid similar incidents from happening in the future, she thought hard and, after many days of research, found that the cracked shuttle and broken yarn were caused by the shuttle not being smooth and not being checked beforehand. From this, she concluded that it was necessary to do all the preparatory work before going to work. Since then, every time she goes to work, she always arrives early to check if there is anything wrong with the machine? Whether the pirns are sufficient? Whether the spindles are clean?....

    She also pays close attention to various phenomena in the production process. When the leather joint on the car is broken, she will take it to see where it is broken, and then ask the maintenance worker why it is broken in this place. When the picker breaks, she will check whether it is in the same place as the picker broken by others? Is the reason for the break the looseness of the wood or the excessive power? What measures can be taken to avoid it? After nearly a year of careful observation and hard work, Yang Huimin has initially mastered the general rules of yarn count and mechanical state. Her colleagues praised her as a little "Zhuge Liang". When she is working, she can tell whether the machine is running normally by looking at the "complexion" of the cloth surface and listening to the sound of the shuttle.

    There are many advanced veteran workers in the Zhang Shoupu Cloth Factory, and they have rich production experience. Yang Huimin humbly learns from the advanced experience of these veteran workers. She absorbed the experience of others, coupled with her own experience and creation, and summed up a complete set of work methods. This advanced work method is called the "Yang Huimin Work Method" by the workers and has been widely promoted throughout the factory.

    作个有心人
    上海张守璞布厂挡车女工杨惠敏，挡车织布才五年，已经连续三年零一个月不出次布。她管理的布机台产量，在全市十六家绒布工厂中也是最高的。
    二十三岁的杨惠敏，能够在这样长的时间内保持优质高产，主要是由于她有高度的国家主人翁感，在生产实践中不断刻苦钻研，精心观察，摸索出了一套不出事故、不出次布的规律。有一次，她上班后不久，一只梭子忽然裂开，打断了很多纱头。杨惠敏很难过，觉得自己没有尽到责任，浪费了国家和人民的财产。为了避免以后发生类似的事情，她苦思苦想，经过多天的研究，找到了裂梭断纱是因为梭子不光滑，事先没有检查的缘故。从这点，她得出了上班前要做好一切准备工作的结论。以后，她每次上班，总要提前来到，检查一下机器有没有毛病？纡子是否已备足？地轴是否揩清爽？……。
    她还十分注意生产过程中的各种现象。车子上的皮结坏了，她要拿来看看坏在什么地方，然后问机修工人，为什么会坏在这个地方，梭棒断了，她要查查，和别人断掉的梭棒是不是在一个地方？断的原因是木料松脆还是动力太大？采取什么措施可以避免？经过将近一年的精心观察和刻苦钻研，杨惠敏对纱支和机械状态的一般规律都初步掌握了。同伴们夸奖她像个小“诸葛亮”。她工作时只要看看布面“气色”，听听投梭声音，就能知道机器运转是否正常。
    张守璞布厂有好多位先进的老工人，她们有丰富的生产经验。杨惠敏对这些老工人的先进经验，都虚心学习。她吸收了别人的经验，再加上自己的经验和创造，总结出了一套完整的工作法。这个先进的工作法被工人称为“杨惠敏工作法”，已在全厂普遍推广。
