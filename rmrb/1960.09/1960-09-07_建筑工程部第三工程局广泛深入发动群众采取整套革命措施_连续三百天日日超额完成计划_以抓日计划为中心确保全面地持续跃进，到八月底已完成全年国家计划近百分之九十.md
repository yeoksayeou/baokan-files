　　(Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 6th) The Third Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, after persisting in carrying out the "Daily Red Production" movement, has continuously overfulfilled the production plan for 305 days, maintaining a sustained leap forward in construction.
　　This bureau's "Daily Red" movement was launched under the situation of the Great Leap Forward last year. Based on the guiding ideology of continuous revolution and the spirit of making economic work more and more detailed, they widely and deeply mobilized the broad masses of workers and staff to improve enterprise management, and adopted a complete set of revolutionary measures, focusing on the central link of the daily production plan, so that the entire bureau, from November 1st of last year to the end of August this year, for 305 days, experienced "Daily Red Production", exceeding the plan every ten days and leaping forward every month. During this stage, the Third Bureau of Engineering's monthly production was balanced. In the past twenty-four ten-day periods of this year, the first ten days averaged 34.74% of the monthly plan, the middle ten days 33.99%, and the last ten days 31.27%. By the end of August, this engineering bureau had completed 89.97% of the annual national plan. So far, more than 40% of all the engineering offices and work areas in the bureau have entered 1961.
　　Under the unified will of "Daily Red Production," the Third Bureau of Engineering's workers actively launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement, designed and produced new structures and new materials, vigorously promoted material conservation and substitution, and vigorously developed the production of building materials, thereby ensuring that construction could be carried out persistently and at a high speed. In the first half of the year alone, the workers and staff put forward more than 100,400 innovation proposals for the use of new materials, substitute materials, and design modifications, and more than 40,000 of them have been used in production, saving more than 3,000 tons of steel, more than 13,000 tons of cement, and more than 9,800 cubic meters of wood. During this period, the state allocated only 60% of the required amount of steel, 50% of wood, and 59% of cement, but they overfulfilled the production plan. In the first half of this year, the bureau has completed 245 projects.
　　Driven by the "Daily Red Production" movement, the Third Bureau of Engineering has newly established a complete set of mass-based production management systems for planning, construction, technology, and labor organization; leading cadres at all levels have universally established a work style of going deep into the front line of production. Leading cadres at the bureau, company, and engineering office levels have respectively implemented the "One, Two, Three" (one day for study, two days for meetings and office work, three days going deep into the grassroots), "One, One, Four," and "Two, Six" (study in two shifts every Tuesday and Saturday morning, two hours of brainstorming meetings to study work every other day, and six hours going deep into the team groups) leadership systems, grasping production practically and deeply. Cadres in all functional departments also contracted for each work area and rotated to live at the grassroots level, working with the workers to brainstorm and solve problems in production in a timely manner. Thanks to the establishment of advanced production management order and work style throughout the bureau, all economic management indicators have achieved a comprehensive leap forward. For example, in terms of labor productivity, because each work type strictly implements the plan, coordinated actions, and tight coordination, the average daily output value of construction and installation workers in the bureau has been significantly improved, and the cost of engineering has been greatly reduced.
　　After the bureau achieved "Daily Red Production," a normal production order was established, which not only enabled workers and staff to maintain a full and vigorous fighting will and production enthusiasm, but also created better conditions for workers to carry out political, cultural, and technical learning and carry out recreational and sports activities. Many construction sites have implemented the "contracted production and guaranteed rest" system with the workers' production team as the unit, so that some people produce every day and some people rest every day. The broad masses of workers and staff are all happy and cheerful, and they joyfully praise: "Daily Red Production, tasks leap forward every month, there is both work and leisure, the more we work, the greater our enthusiasm!"
　　In order to ensure "Daily Red Production," the Third Bureau of Construction Engineering has taken a series of revolutionary measures in enterprise management, the main ones being:
　　First, adapt to the needs of production and carry out enterprise management reform. In terms of planning management, in order to adapt to the needs of the "Daily Red Production" movement, the bureau changed the past system of parallel management of quarterly, monthly, ten-day, and daily plans by organizations at all levels, and regarded the quarterly and monthly plans as stage-based battle plans, and the ten-day and daily plans as combat plans in the entire battle. When compiling monthly, ten-day, and daily plans, the method of "from the masses, to the masses" is adopted. Before the plan is compiled, the planning department goes deep into the construction site to understand the situation. After the plan is compiled, it is disclosed to the masses around technical management, quota management, material management, and cost management requirements. The workers of the production team discuss according to these "bottom lines," and then use the "five fix" system of fixing people, time, quality, quantity, and responsibility to ensure the completion of the production plan. In this way, everyone manages the plan, everyone knows the numbers, and responsibility is assigned to the group and to the individual. Every worker knows where to do what on what day of the month, week, and day, and where to do what tomorrow. After the broad masses grasp the plan, they do everything possible to ensure its completion.
　　In terms of construction management, the construction management methods of "detailed investigation, frequent arrangement, and firm grasp" have been widely promoted. "Detailed investigation" means understanding the situation and knowing the numbers. "Frequent arrangement" mainly means arranging the order of engineering projects, finding the key points and main attack directions; arranging the order of construction problems, finding the key and weak links. "Firm grasp" means taking grasping the daily plan as the center and implementing the "four grasps and four not lets go." That is, grasping the current day's production without letting go of the next day's preparation; grasping the workload indicators without letting go of the image progress; grasping the main project without letting go of the ending project; grasping the key project without letting go of the general project. Among the "four grasps and four not lets go," grasping the current day's production and the next day's preparation is the basic link. Worker teams also have three grasps: first, grasping task allocation and construction preparation; second, grasping labor combination and work sequence connection; and third, grasping competition and evaluation.
　　In terms of statistics, the bureau, through practice, has explored and established a daily progress rapid forecast statistical system. The specific method is to advance the daily report statistical time to 12:00 noon on the same day. At the production meeting held at this time, based on the actual completion in the first half of the day and the production supervisor's practical arrangements for the second half of the day, the case is discussed and decided on the spot, which serves both as the basis for the teams to carry out evaluation and as the statistics for ensuring the completion of the number on the same day, and the progress daily report is reported in advance. At the same time, according to the grassroots arrangements for the next day, the number to be completed the next day is estimated, which is called the "Tomorrow's Plan" and becomes a complete system combining statistics, planning, and production. In this way, under normal circumstances, the bureau-level leaders can understand the completion situation on the same day and foresee the possible completion situation on the next day before getting off work on the same day, providing powerful data for analyzing and studying production guidance.
　　In terms of labor organization, the main thing is to improve the combat effectiveness of grassroots production teams. First of all, attention is paid to the allocation of political backbones in the team. Party branches are established in mixed production teams, Party groups are established in production groups, and a core group composed of the group leaders of Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League groups and individual old technicians is formed in the production group to lead the production work of the group. At the same time, the worker management system of several staff members under the leadership of the production group leader is implemented (the several staff members include planning statisticians, labor and wage staff, quality and safety staff, material staff, cost accounting staff, and propagandists, etc., which can be more or less according to actual needs), giving full play to the role of each person.
　　Second, develop diversified operations, vigorously promote conservation and substitution, and solve the problem of building materials. The bureau began to create diversified operations in the second half of 1958. Up to now, it has owned fifty-four large and small backbone factories belonging to raw material production, machinery manufacturing, processing components, and repairs, and has initially formed a diversified operation industrial network serving construction. In 1959, the main products produced reached more than sixty kinds, among which steel, cement, and wood substitutes have been partially self-sufficient, and mineral wool, oil felt paper, refractory bricks, electrodes, calcium carbide, etc. have all achieved self-sufficiency. At the same time, the bureau also vigorously promoted design innovation and design revolution with new technologies, new materials, and new structures as the central content, saving building materials.
　　Third, vigorously promote the style of mutual assistance and cooperation between Party A and Party B to ensure high-speed construction. In the cooperation between Party A and Party B, an important link that the Third Bureau of Engineering especially grasps is to take the initiative to undertake the difficulties of Party A, be bold and responsible, and uniformly regulate and centrally use building materials, mobilize material potential, and ensure high-speed construction. According to incomplete statistics, in the first half of the year alone, it mutually regulated and used 2,033 tons of steel, 20,890 tons of cement, and more than 2,480 cubic meters of wood for Party A, ensuring the early commissioning of new projects such as the Lanzhou Refinery and the Lanzhou Chemical Plant. At the same time, the Third Bureau of Engineering also jointly formed a construction site Party committee with Party A on large-scale construction sites, unifiedly led the construction, and unifiedly used the manpower and material resources of both Party A and Party B, which guaranteed the relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation from the organizational system.

    建筑工程部第三工程局广泛深入发动群众采取整套革命措施
    连续三百天日日超额完成计划
    以抓日计划为中心确保全面地持续跃进，到八月底已完成全年国家计划近百分之九十
    本报兰州6日电　建筑工程部第三工程局坚持开展生产日日红运动以后，连续三百零五天日日超额完成生产计划，使建筑施工持久地保持了持续跃进的形势。
    这个局的日日红运动是在去年大跃进的形势下开展起来的。他们本着不断革命的指导思想和经济工作愈做愈细的精神，广泛深入地发动广大职工群众改进企业管理，并且采取整套的革命措施，狠抓日生产计划这个中心环节，使全局从去年11月1日到今年8月底的三百零五天，出现了生产日日红、旬旬超、月月跨。在这一阶段中，第三工程局每月的生产都是均衡的，今年过去的二十四个旬，上旬平均完成月计划的34.74％，中旬完成33.99％，下旬完成31.27％。到8月底为止，这个工程局已完成全年国家计划的89.97％，到目前为止，全局所有的工程处和工区中，已有40％以上跨入1961年。
    第三工程局职工在生产日日红的统一意志下，积极开展技术革新和技术革命运动，设计和生产新结构新材料，大搞材料节约代用，大办建筑材料生产，从而保证了建筑施工能够持久地高速度地进行。仅在上半年，职工群众即提出采用新材料、代用材料和修改设计方面的革新建议十万零四千余件，有四万余件已被用于生产，节约了钢材三千余吨，水泥一万三千余吨，木材九千八百多立米。这个期间，国家调拨钢材只占需要量的60％、木材50％、水泥59％，他们却超额完成了生产计划。今年上半年全局交工项目已达二百四十五项。
    在生产日日红运动的推动下，第三工程局新建立了整套的群众性的计划、施工、技术、劳动组织等生产管理制度；各级领导干部都普遍树立了深入生产第一线的工作作风。局、公司和工程处各级干部分别贯彻了“一二三”（一天学习，两天开会、办公，三天深入基层）、“一一四”和“二六”（每星期二、六上午分两班轮流学习，其余各天两小时开碰头会研究工作，六小时深入队组）领导制，切实深入地抓生产。各职能处科干部也都分工包干各工区和轮流住到基层，同工人一起同谋共策，及时发现和解决生产中的问题。全局由于建立起先进的生产管理秩序和工作作风，各项经济管理指标都获得全面跃进。例如在劳动生产率方面，因为各工种之间严格执行计划，协同动作，环环紧扣，全局建筑安装工人的平均日产值已有显著提高，工程成本则大大降低。
    全局实现生产日日红以后，建立了正常的生产秩序，这不仅使职工群众经常保持饱满旺盛的战斗意志和生产积极性，而且给职工进行政治、文化、技术学习和开展文娱体育活动，创造了更好的条件。不少工地都以工人生产小组为单位，实行了“包产包休”制，每天有人生产，每天有人休息。广大职工群众人人精神愉快心情舒畅，他们欢欣地称赞：“生产日日红，任务月月跨，有劳又有逸，越干劲越大！”
    建筑工程部第三工程局为了保证生产日日红，在企业管理上采取了一系列革命措施，其中主要的有：
    第一，适应生产需要，进行企业管理改革。在计划管理方面，为适应生产日日红运动的需要，全局改变了过去各级组织平行管理季月旬日计划的制度，而把季月计划作为一个阶段的战役计划，把旬日计划作为整个战役中的战斗计划。编制月旬日计划时，都是采取从群众中来到群众中去的方法。计划编制前，计划部门深入工地摸清情况，计划编制后，围绕技术管理、定额管理、料具管理和成本管理等要求，向群众交底。生产小组的工人根据这些“底”进行讨论，然后用定人、定时、定质、定量、定责任的“五定”制度，保证生产计划完成。这样即作到了人人管计划，个个心中有数，责任到组到人。每个工人都知道本月本旬和当天应该在什么地方做什么，明天又将在什么地方做什么。广大群众掌握计划以后，就千方百计保证计划的完成。
    在施工管理方面，普遍推广了细摸、勤排、狠抓的施工管理方法。细摸，就是要了解情况，做到心中有数。勤排，主要是工程项目排队，找出重点及主攻方向；施工问题排队，找出关键及薄弱环节。狠抓，就是以抓日计划为中心，贯彻“四抓四不放”。即抓当
  日生产，不放松次日准备；抓工作量指标，不放松形象进度；抓主体工程，不放松结尾项目；抓重点工程，不放松一般工程。在“四抓四不放”中，又以抓当日生产和次日准备为基本环节。工人队组也有三抓：一抓任务分配和施工准备，二抓劳动组合和工序搭接，三抓竞赛评比。
    在统计方面，全局通过实践摸索，建立了日进度快速预报统计制度。具体作法是，把日报统计时间提前到当日中午十二时，在这时召开的生产碰头会上，根据上半天实际完成情况和基层生产主管人对下半天生产的切实安排，当场讨论定案，既作为各队组开展评比的根据，又作为当天确保完成的数字进行统计，提前报出进度日报。同时，根据基层的次日安排，预计次日完成数字，称为“明日计划”，成为统计、计划、生产三结合的一个完整制度。这样，在正常情况下，局一级领导均能在当日下班前，既能了解当日完成情况，又能预见明日可能完成的情况，对分析研究生产指导生产提供了有力的资料。
    在劳动组织方面，主要是提高基层生产队组的战斗力。首先注意了队组中政治骨干的配备，在混合生产队中建立党支部，在生产小组中建立党小组，并在生产小组中组成由党、政、工、团小组组长和个别老技工参加的核心小组，领导小组的生产工作。同时实行在生产小组长领导下的几大员的工人管理制度（几大员包括计划统计员、劳资员、质量安全员、材料员、成本核算员、宣传员等，根据实际需要可多可少），充分发挥每个人的作用。
    第二，开展多种经营，大搞节约代用，解决建筑材料问题。全局从1958年下半年开始创办多种经营，到目前为止，已拥有属于原材料生产、机械制造、加工构件和修理的大小骨干工厂五十四个，初步形成了一个为建筑施工服务的多种经营工业网。1959年生产的主要产品达六十多种，其中像钢材、水泥、木材代用品已部分自给，矿渣棉、油毡纸、耐火砖、电极、电石等全部达到自给自足。与此同时，全局还大搞以新技术、新材料、新结构为中心内容的设计革新和设计革命，节约建筑材料。
    第三，大兴甲乙两方互助协作之风，保证高速度施工。在甲乙双方协作中，第三工程局特别抓住的一个重要环节，就是主动承担甲方困难，大胆负责，统一调剂和集中使用建筑材料，调动物资潜力，保证高速度施工。据不完全统计，仅上半年即给甲方相互调剂串用钢材两千零三十三吨、水泥两万零八百九十吨、木材两千四百八十多立方米，保证了兰州炼油厂、兰州化工厂等新建工程的提前投入生产。同时，第三工程局并在大型工程工地与甲方联合组成工地党委会，统一领导施工，统一使用甲乙双方的人力物力，这就从组织制度上保证了互助协作的关系。
