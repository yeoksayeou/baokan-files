　　We are Gradually Mastering the Laws of Crop Growth
　　Shaanxi Chang'an County Xiliu Commune Xincun Management Area Youth Experimental Farm Study Group
    Our Xiliu Commune Xincun Management Area Youth Experimental Farm has a total of thirty-five young people. We began studying Chairman Mao's works in March 1959. Chairman Mao's works have given us infinite wisdom and strength.
    In 1958, the commune Party committee gave us a task: to vigorously conduct scientific experiments and establish a banner for agricultural production. The Party gave us such an important task, and we felt very honored. At that time, we planted three mu and six fen of high-yield satellite fields, which were deeply ploughed and heavily fertilized. We thought this wheat would definitely produce a high yield. In the first winter, the wheat seedlings grew very strong. But in the second spring, just after passing the greening stage, there was some abnormal development, and the wheat leaves grew wildly, more than a foot long. After a wind and rain, the wheat seedlings fell to the ground. We were very distressed, and some young people began to doubt: "Is deep ploughing and heavy fertilization really right?" At this critical moment, Secretary Liu of the commune Party committee came. He encouraged us and said: Don't be discouraged by failure. The experiment itself contains the possibility of both success and failure. He also instructed us to study "On Practice" to help us find ways to actively salvage the situation. The Party's support gave us strength. The next day, we began to study "On Practice." Chairman Mao told us in "On Practice": "If people want to achieve victory in their work, that is, to achieve the desired results, they must make their thinking conform to the laws of the objective external world. If it does not conform, they will fail in practice. After experiencing failure, people will also learn from the failure and correct their thinking to make it suitable for the laws of the external world. People can turn failure into victory. The so-called 'failure is the mother of success' and 'a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit' is the reason." Chairman Mao's words spoke to our hearts, and everyone became active again. Some said: "Yes! We are doing experimental fields to find out the laws of high wheat yield." Some said: "Even if we fail, we can't be discouraged. We must learn from the failure. What's more, we haven't failed yet!" The more we discussed, the more energetic we became. Everyone unanimously decided to learn from the temporary failure and turn failure into success. Then, we turned to propose measures and think of solutions. Some proposed ridging the soil in rows, some proposed pruning the leaves, and some proposed building frames, etc. Some were realistic, and some were not. The discussion was very lively.
    The next day it was still raining heavily, but none of us wanted to sit in the house complaining. We braved the rain to "treat" the wheat. After several months of careful nurturing, we finally achieved a high yield of 1,173 jin of wheat per mu, more than four times the local yield. We received awards from the Party and Youth League organizations at the provincial, municipal, county, and commune levels. At the same time, we also gained many valuable experiences and lessons from practice.
    After this, everyone generally requested to be organized to study Chairman Mao's works. Therefore, we thirty-five people were divided into four study groups and established a study system. Our study method is: a leading group was established with five comrades who graduated from senior primary school as the core. They studied one step ahead of the others, and then explained it to everyone in the light of practical problems. We have been adhering to this study without interruption. Over the past year, we have studied more than 20 articles, including "On Practice," "On Contradiction," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "Introducing a Cooperative." Everyone's interest in learning is growing.
    This group of young people is very motivated, but in the past, we read very little. We only learned some local techniques for growing crops from the elderly. We had never seen or heard of research on the growth laws of crops and scientific experiments. Therefore, on the one hand, we felt that this matter was indeed novel, and on the other hand, we were a little timid and lacked confidence. Some said: "Growing crops is a rough job. Nothing can be researched." Some said: "We are rough people. We can do physical work, but we have never seen scientific research." After studying "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," we first understood the basic truth that all knowledge comes from practice. Chairman Mao said: "If anyone wants to know anything, there is no way to solve it except by contacting that thing, that is, by living in (practicing in) the environment of that thing." Chairman Mao also told us that the two aspects of a contradiction can be transformed into each other under certain conditions. Not understanding can be transformed into understanding, not knowing can be transformed into knowing, and knowing little can be transformed into knowing a lot. These truths greatly enlightened us and made us establish confidence in doing scientific experiments. Everyone said: "Chairman Mao said it so well! We deal with crops all day long, and we can figure out its temperament (that is, its regularity)!" In the wheat variety experiment, some young people complained that the experiment was too troublesome and said: "Bima No. 1 is already very good. Why bother?" We explained to everyone according to the principles taught by Chairman Mao that everything is constantly developing, and people's understanding is also developing with the development of things. The same is true for varieties. The good varieties now may no longer be good varieties in one or two years. This requires us to continuously cultivate better new varieties to promote the development of agriculture. After this explanation and discussion, everyone realized the importance of variety testing, actively participated in seed selection and hybridization experiments, and brought back improved varieties from other places. Last year, we conducted 216 new varieties of wheat alone, and more than 30 varieties have been promoted.
    Chairman Mao said in "On Contradiction" that contradiction exists in the development process of all things, which is the universality of contradiction. However, the contradiction of any thing has its particularity, "This special contradiction constitutes the special essence of one thing that distinguishes it from other things." These words made us deeply feel that as a new farmer in a socialist society, we must not only have soaring enthusiasm, but also have the ability to master the growth and development laws of crops, and manage them differently according to the different growth laws of crops, so that the crops can absorb the required nutrients in time and develop quickly. For example, for cotton, the Dai Zi No. 15 has a large plant shape, and the Heping cotton has a small plant shape. Therefore, different close planting methods should be adopted for different varieties; Heping cotton has a small plant shape and short nodes, and has less stored nutrients, so the number of fertilizations can be more and the amount of fertilization each time can be less; while Dai Zi No. 15 cotton has a large plant shape and a large amount of stored nutrients, so the number of fertilizations can be less and the amount of fertilization each time can be more; other measures should also be different. Field management work should also see the different conditions of the land. For example, the water level in the south of our village is low and the ground is dry, while the water level in the north of the village is high and the soil is often moist. Different areas should be treated differently. In the past, we did not understand these principles and suffered losses. For example, in the cotton field management in 1958, we did not master the characteristics of different cotton varieties, and treated Heping cotton and Dai Zi No. 15 cotton with the same fertilization and irrigation, resulting in a boll shedding rate of 40% for Heping cotton, which suffered undue losses. After studying "On Contradiction" and understanding the relationship between the universality and particularity of contradiction, we also understood the principle of sowing according to the type of seeds, time, and fertility, and the principle of field management according to the weather, land, and varieties. In this way, we can effectively and reasonably implement the Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture.
    In the past year or so, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we have made achievements in developing agricultural scientific experiments and studying the laws of various crops. We have figured out some laws in variety testing, how to reduce cotton boll shedding, as well as reasonable close planting, deep plowing depth, and fertilizer composition of wheat. We have established various experimental fields, satellite fields, high-yield plots, variety testing bases, established a technology research group, and established a crop file system. In 1959, in addition to 3.6 mu of wheat with a yield of 1,173 jin per mu, there were also 10 mu with a yield of 596 jin per mu; more than 2 mu of corn with a yield of 1,117 jin per mu; 1 mu of cotton with a yield of more than 620 jin of ginned cotton, and 14 mu with a yield of more than 157 jin per mu. All of these have played a certain role in promoting the production of the entire commune.
    The more we study Chairman Mao's works, the more we feel that we must study them. Although our education level is relatively low, we learn a little and use a little, and the effect of combining theory with practice is great. In the future, we must continue to work hard and let learning further promote the development of production.

　　我们在逐渐掌握庄稼生长的规律
　　陕西长安县细柳公社新村管理区青年试验农场学习组
    我们细柳公社新村管理区青年试验农场共三十五名青年，从1959年3月开始学习毛主席著作。毛主席著作给了我们无穷的智慧和力量。
    1958年公社党委交给我们一项任务：大搞科学试验，为农业生产树立旗帜。党把这样重大的任务交给了我们，我们感到很光荣。当时我们种了三亩六分高产卫星田，地翻得很深，肥也上得很多。我们以为这块小麦一定能高产。头一年冬天，麦苗长得很壮实。但是第二年春天，刚一过了返青关，就有些畸形发展，麦叶疯长一尺多长。一场风雨，麦苗倒伏了一地。我们很苦恼，有些青年怀疑起来：“深翻地、多施肥究竟对不对？”正在这个节骨眼上，公社党委刘书记来了，他鼓励我们说：失败了不要灰心，搞试验本身就是含着成功与失败两种可能性，并且指示我们学习《实践论》，帮助我们想办法积极挽救。党的支持给了我们力量。第二天就开始学习《实践论》。毛主席在《实践论》里告诉我们：“人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，一定要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性，如果不合，就会在实践中失败。人们经过失败之后，也就从失败取得教训，改正自己的思想使之适合于外界的规律性，人们就能变失败为胜利，所谓‘失败者成功之母’，‘吃一堑长一智’，就是这个道理。”毛主席的话，句句说在我们的心上，大家又活跃起来了。有的说：“对！我们搞试验田，就是要摸小麦高产的规律。”有的说：“就是失败了也不能灰心，要从失败中吸取教训，何况我们现在还没有失败！”越讨论劲越大，大家一致决定，要从暂时的失败中找教训，变失败为成功。接着就转入了提措施想办法。有的提出分行培土，有的提出剪叶，有的提出搭架等等。有虚有实，讨论得非常热烈。
    第二天天还下着大雨，但是我们谁也不愿意坐在屋里怨天尤人，就冒雨给小麦“治病”。经过我们几个月的细心抚育，终于获得了高产，亩产小麦一千一百七十三斤，高出当地产量四倍多，得到省、市、县和公社各级党、团组织的奖励。同时，我们也从实践中取得了许多宝贵的经验和教训。
    这以后，大家普遍要求组织起来学习毛主席著作，于是，我们三十五人分成四个学习小组，建立了学习制度。我们的学习办法是：以五个高小毕业的同志为核心成立了领导小组，他们先学习一步，然后，结合实际问题给大家讲解。我们就一直坚持学习，没有间断。一年来，我们已经学习了《实践论》、《矛盾论》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《关于农业合作化问题》、《星星之火，可以燎原》、《愚公移山》、《介绍一个合作社》等二十多篇文章，大家越学兴趣越大。
    我们这一伙青年，干劲都很大，但是过去念的书很少，只是跟着老年人学习了一些种庄稼的土技术，对于研究农作物的生长规律，搞科学试验，大家见也没见过，因而一方面感到这事确实新鲜，另一方面又有些胆怯，没有信心。有的说：“种庄稼是个粗活，研究不出来什么东西。”有的说：“咱们是老粗，出力气可以，搞科学研究还没见过。”学习《实践论》和《矛盾论》以后，首先使我们懂得了一切知识都是从实践中得来的这个基本道理。毛主席说：“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。”毛主席还告诉我们，矛盾的两方面在一定的条件下，是可以互相转化的，不懂可以变为懂，不知可以变为知，知之不多可以变为知之甚多。这些道理对我们启发很大，使我们树立起了搞科学试验的信心。大家都说：“毛主席说的真好！我们整天和庄稼打交道，我们就能摸着它的脾气（即规律性）！”在搞小麦品种试验中，有些青年嫌搞试验太麻烦，说：“碧蚂一号已经很好了，为啥要自找麻烦？”我们就按照毛主席教给的道理给大家讲解，任何事物都是不断发展的，人们的认识也是跟着事物的发展而发展的。品种也是这样，现在好的品种，过一、二年，可能就再不是好品种了，这就要求我们不断培育更好的新品种，促进农业的发展。这样讲解讨论以后，大家认识了搞品种试验的重要，都积极参加选种和杂交试验，并从外地找回了良种。去年，光小麦我们就搞了二百一十六种新品种，有三十多种已经推广。
    毛主席在《矛盾论》里说，矛盾存在于一切事物的发展过程中，这是矛盾的普遍性。但任何事物的矛盾又有它的特殊性，“这种特殊的矛盾，就构成一事物区别于他事物的特殊的本质”。这些话使我们深深感到，作一个社会主义社会的新农民，不仅要有冲天的干劲，而且要有掌握庄稼生长和发展规律的能力，根据庄稼不同的生长规律，进行不同的管理，使庄稼及时地吸收到需要的营养，很快地发育。如同是棉花，岱字十五号株形大，和平棉株形小，这就要在不同的品种上采取不同的密植方法；和平棉因株形小、节短，本身储备营养少，施肥次数可多些，每次施肥量可少些；而岱字十五号棉因株形大，储备营养量也大，施肥次数可少些，每次可多施些；其它措施也要有所不同。田间管理工作还要看到土地情况的不同，像我们村南水位低，地面干燥，村北水位高，土壤经常湿润，地区不同，也就要给以不同的对待。过去我们不懂得这些道理，就吃了亏，如在1958年棉田管理中，没有掌握不同棉花品种的特点，对和平棉和岱字十五号棉的施肥和灌水都是同一对待，结果使和平棉落蕾率达到40％，受到了不应有的损失。学了《矛盾论》，懂得了矛盾的普遍性和特殊性的关系后，我们也就懂得了看种、看时、看地力进行播种的道理，看天、看地、看品种进行田间管理的道理。这样，我们就能切实地合理地贯彻农业八字宪法。
    这一年多来，我们在毛泽东思想的指导下，在开展农业科学试验、研究各种作物的规律方面，取得了成绩。在品种试验、如何减少棉花脱铃，以及小麦合理密植、深翻程度、施肥成分等方面，都摸到一些规律。建立了各种试验田、卫星田、丰产方、品种试验基地，成立了技术研究组，建立了作物档案制度。1959年除了三亩六分小麦亩产一千一百七十三斤外，还有十亩亩产五百九十六斤；二亩多玉米亩产一千一百一十七斤；一亩棉花亩产皮棉六百二十多斤，十四亩亩产一百五十七斤多。所有这些，对整个公社的生产都起了一定的推动作用。
    我们学习毛主席著作越学越感觉到非学不可。虽然我们的文化程度比较低，但是，我们学一点用一点，理论联系实际，效果很大。今后要继续努力，让学习进一步推动生产的发展。
