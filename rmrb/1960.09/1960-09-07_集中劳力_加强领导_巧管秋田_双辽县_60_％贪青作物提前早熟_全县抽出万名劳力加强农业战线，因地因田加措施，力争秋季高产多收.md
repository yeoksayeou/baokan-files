This newspaper reports from Changchun on the 6th: Shuangliao County, Jilin Province, has adopted the method of "one increase, two assignments, and three skills" to apply the greatest force to the late-stage management of autumn fields, making every effort to tackle the problem of overly lush crops, and has achieved early maturity effects.

This year, Shuangliao County's grain crop planting area is 98,600 hectares (15 mu per hectare). After two months of weeding and fertilization, except for some low-lying areas that suffered varying degrees of waterlogging, most crops are growing well. However, due to this year's excessive rainfall, lack of sunshine, and low temperatures, some crops developed slowly in the early stages and grew overly lush in the later stages. After inspection, it was found that 9% of the county's major autumn crops were still overly lush, with some sorghum still flowering and some corn just emerging. If measures are not taken immediately to promote early maturity, this year's harvest will be affected. To this end, the Shuangliao County Party Committee decided to seize the current critical half-month period, increase field labor, promote early maturity of overly lush crops, and strive for a better grain harvest in autumn. In order to implement the County Party Committee's decision, the First Secretary Li Ruizhang personally took command, with twelve County Party Committee members forming five groups, which went deep into five communes to conduct investigations and research on the current production situation together with cadres from the management districts and production teams. They believed that the central problem of strengthening late-stage field management was to mobilize sufficient labor. The main solutions for resolving the labor shortage were "one increase, two assignments, and three skills."

"One increase" means increasing the labor force on the agricultural front. As a result of implementing this measure, a total of 10,650 laborers were mobilized throughout the county, and 9,600 people have already gone to the fields, increasing the number of people engaged in agricultural production by 17.2% compared to early August. "Two assignments" is a measure to strengthen leadership. The specific approach is to assign leading cadres to management districts and production teams as deputies; assign cadres from county-level agencies to rural areas to carry out central work and strengthen the front lines of production. After specifically helping the communes and teams strengthen leadership, it greatly boosted the masses' enthusiasm for labor and promoted the development of the campaign to break through the barrier of overly lush autumn fields. "Three skills" are: skillful management, skillful deployment of forces, and skillful arrangement. The specific approaches are: (1) Field consultations determine measures, and skillful management is based on local conditions and seedlings. For example, Li Sheng, the Party Branch Secretary of the Yongan Management District of the Wohu People's Commune, went deep into the First Production Team, consulted with cadres of the production team and experienced farmers and technicians, inspected the site, ranked the plots, classified the crops, and identified overly lush crops, then took different measures based on different degrees. They divided more than 20 hectares of overly lush land into two categories, focusing on small seedlings, short plants, and plants that had not yet formed ears, first applying phosphorus and potassium fertilizer, releasing autumn ridges, and removing large weeds; late-stage management was applied to tall stalks, plants with formed ears and flowering, and plants that had begun grain filling. More than 20 commune members were organized, following the principle of prioritizing key areas and then general areas, and in two days, they fertilized, weeded, and released autumn ridges for more than 10 hectares of seriously overly lush crops. (2) Labor is assigned according to people and tasks, and forces are skillfully deployed to maximize everyone's abilities. Implement a three-way ranking of tasks, labor, and time, and a four-way matching of labor strength, task difficulty, technical complexity, and time urgency, to save labor, produce more output, and ensure quality.

The Dongfanghong Management District of the Zhengjiatun People's Commune has a planting area of 1,782 hectares this year, of which more than 150 hectares are overly lush. Based on an average of 10 workdays per hectare, a total of 1,500 workdays are needed. However, the labor force invested in late-stage field management in the entire district is only 250 people, so it would take more than eight days to complete the task. However, because they skillfully deployed forces and implemented a system of one team of people and two sets of arrangements, achieving dual use of each person, they saved manpower and completed the field management tasks ahead of schedule. (3) Arrange farm work according to seasons and time, and skillfully arrange priorities, combining the county's more than 580 late-stage field management professional teams with fertilizer accumulation, sideline occupations, wheat threshing, and logistics. For example, the High-Yield Command Area of the Wangben Commune arranges daily tasks in the morning, noon, and evening. Every morning when the dew is heavy, they organize manpower to rush to apply chemical fertilizer (because chemical fertilizer is easy to dissolve with dew); at noon when the sun is scorching, they thresh wheat; in the afternoon, they release autumn ridges and remove large weeds; and in the evening, they use one hour to carry out fertilizer accumulation activities. At present, 45 management districts (accounting for 85% of the total number of management districts) and more than 520 production teams (accounting for 89.3% of the total number of production teams) throughout the county have implemented the "three skills" method.

After taking the above measures, significant results have been achieved. Currently, more than 15,000 hectares of autumn ridges have been released and large weeds removed throughout the county, the accumulated water in more than 25,000 hectares of waterlogged land has been completely drained, more than 2,840 hectares have been fertilized, and 5,200 hectares of corn and sunflower have been artificially pollinated, prompting more than 60% of the county's overly lush crops to mature early.

    集中劳力　加强领导　巧管秋田
    双辽县60％贪青作物提前早熟
    全县抽出万名劳力加强农业战线，因地因田加措施，力争秋季高产多收
    本报长春6日电　吉林省双辽县采取“一增、二派、三巧”的方法，把最大的力量用于秋田后期管理，千方百计主攻作物贪青，已收到促进早熟效果。
    双辽县今年粮谷作物播种面积九万八千六百公顷（每公顷十五市亩），经过两个月的铲趟、追肥，除部分洼地遭受不同程度的涝害以外，大部分庄稼生长良好。但是，由于今年雨水多、日照少、气温低，某些作物前期发育缓慢、后期贪青徒长。经过检查发现：全县尚有9％的大秋作物贪青，其中一部分高粱正在开花，一部分玉米刚刚出蓼，如不立即采取措施，促进早熟，就会影响今年的收成。为此，中共双辽县委决定：抓住目前半个月的关键时期，增强田间劳力，促进贪青作物早熟，力争秋收多打粮。为了贯彻执行县委决定，由第一书记李瑞章亲自挂帅，以十二名县委委员为主组成五个小组，分别深入五个公社，会同管理区、生产队的干部，对当前生产情况作了调查研究，认为加强后期田间管理的中心问题是调集足够的劳力，而解决劳力的办法，主要是“一增、二派、三巧”。
    “一增”是增加农业战线的劳动力。执行这个措施的结果，全县共抽出一万零六百五十多名劳动力，现在已有九千六百人下田，从而使参加农业生产的人数比8月上旬增加了17.2％。“二派”就是加强领导的一项措施。具体做法是派领导干部到管理区、生产队兼任副职；派县各级机关干部到农村搞中心工作，加强生产第一线。具体帮助社队加强领导以后，大大鼓舞了群众的劳动热情，促进了大破秋田贪青关运动的开展。“三巧”是：巧管理、巧用兵、巧安排。具体做法是：（1）田间会诊定措施、因地因苗巧管理。如卧虎人民公社永安管理区总支书记李生深入到第一生产队，会同生产队的干部和有经验的农民、技术员商量，并到现场查看，进行地块排队，作物分等，找出贪青庄稼，然后根据不同程度采取不同措施。他们把二十多公顷贪青地划为两类，以苗小、棵矮、没结穗的为重点，先追磷钾肥，放秋垄，拔大草；对秸棵高、结穗扬花和开始灌浆的后管。组织二十多名社员，本着先重点、后一般的原则，两天就给十多公顷的贪青严重庄稼追了肥，拔了草，放了秋垄。（2）因人因活派劳力，各尽所能巧用兵。实行活计、劳力、时间三排队，劳力强弱、活计轻重、技术性高低、时间急缓四对口，做到省劳力、多出活、保质量。
    郑家屯人民公社东方红管理区今年播种面积一千七百八十二公顷，其中有一百五十多公顷贪青地，按每公顷平均需十个工计算，共需一千五百个工日。可是全区投入后期田间管理的劳动力只有二百五十人，这样，就需要八天多时间才能完成。但是，由于他们作到巧用兵，实行了一套人马、两套安排，做到了一人二用，既节省了人力，又提前完成了田间管理任务。（3）因节令因时间排农活，轻重缓急巧安排，把全县五百八十多个后期田间管理专业队和积肥、副业、打麦、后勤等工作结合起来。如王奔公社高产指挥区，把每天活计分早、午、晚加以安排，每天早晨露水大就组织人力突击追化肥（因为有露水化肥容易化）；晌午太阳毒就打麦；下午放秋垄、拔大草；晚上利用一小时开展积肥活动。目前，全县已经有四十五个管理区（占管理区总数的85％）、五百二十多个生产队（占生产队总数的89.3％），推行了“三巧”方法。
    采取上述办法以后，收到了显著效果。目前全县已经放秋垄、拔大草一万五千多公顷，两万五千多公顷涝洼地里的积水全部排出，追肥两千八百四十多公顷，玉米、向日葵人工授粉五千二百公顷，促使全县60％以上的贪青作物提前早熟。
