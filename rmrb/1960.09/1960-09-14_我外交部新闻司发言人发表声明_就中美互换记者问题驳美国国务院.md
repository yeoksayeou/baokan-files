Xinhua News Agency, September 13th. The spokesperson of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement today regarding the Sino-U.S. journalist exchange issue, refuting a statement issued by the U.S. State Department on September 8th that completely distorts the facts and reverses black and white. The full text of the spokesperson's statement from the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is as follows:

On September 8, 1960, the U.S. State Department issued a statement on the issue of Sino-U.S. journalist exchange, stubbornly claiming that the United States has been making efforts to exchange journalists with China on an equal and reciprocal basis, while China is unwilling to do so. On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Herter made similar remarks on the same issue at a meeting of editors and publishers of the United Press International. These statements and remarks completely distort the facts and reverse black and white.

The Chinese government has made unremitting efforts to promote Sino-U.S. journalist exchange, while the U.S. government has consistently opposed and obstructed it without reason. As early as the autumn of 1956 to the spring of 1957, the Chinese government approved thirty-nine American journalists to come to China for news coverage. Due to the U.S. government's ban, only three of these thirty-nine American journalists came to China, disregarding the ban. After returning to their country, these three journalists had their passports revoked. The U.S. government's arbitrary practice of prohibiting American journalists from coming to China put it in a very passive position. Therefore, it later had to change its approach. On the one hand, it approved certain selected American news organizations to send journalists to China to ensure that these journalists acted according to its instructions; on the other hand, it adopted an extremely arrogant imperialist attitude, refusing to allow Chinese journalists to go to the United States for news coverage based on the principle of equality and reciprocity. On August 22, 1957, the U.S. State Department issued a communique stating that the United States would not grant reciprocal visas to Chinese journalists. On August 27 of the same year, then U.S. Secretary of State Dulles openly declared that he did not recognize China's right to demand reciprocity. In order to make the U.S. government understand and abide by the basic code of conduct in international exchanges, and to correct its imperialist attitude, the Chinese government firmly maintains that the Sino-U.S. sides must first reach a formal agreement on exchanging journalists on an equal and reciprocal basis. On September 12, 1957, the Chinese side proposed a draft agreement statement in the Sino-U.S. talks based on this proposition. However, for three years, the U.S. side has been using the excuse that U.S. law cannot grant Chinese journalists reciprocal treatment, refusing to accept this suggestion from the Chinese side.

The U.S. government's position of openly opposing the principle of equality and reciprocity and obstructing Sino-U.S. journalist exchange has been severely condemned by world opinion, including the American press, for a long time. Therefore, it was not until recently that it had to adopt new deceptive tactics. At the ninety-eighth Sino-U.S. talks on June 7 this year, the U.S. side proposed the following draft agreement on the exchange of journalists between China and the United States:

“The Government of the United States of America, within the scope of the Constitution and the relevant laws and regulations currently in force in the United States, and in accordance with the principle of equality and reciprocity, will accept journalists from the People’s Republic of China into the United States so that they can directly report on the situation in the United States. Journalists of the People’s Republic of China who are accepted into the United States will be given the same news reporting facilities as are generally given to foreign journalists in the United States.”

On the surface, this draft from the U.S. side seems to have accepted the principle of equality and reciprocity proposed by the Chinese side. However, as long as this draft is analyzed a little, it can be seen that the U.S. government has not abandoned its consistent position of refusing to abide by the principle of equality and reciprocity. The U.S. side first stated in this draft that the U.S. government accepts Chinese journalists into the United States "within the scope of the Constitution and the relevant laws and regulations currently in force in the United States." This is clearly with ulterior motives. The U.S. government has repeatedly stated in the past that, according to U.S. immigration law, the United States cannot guarantee the reciprocity suggested by the Chinese side. It can be seen that the U.S. side's proposal of so-called "within the scope of the Constitution and the relevant laws and regulations currently in force in the United States" in the draft not only negates the "principle of equality and reciprocity" mentioned at the same time in the draft, but also leaves an excuse for refusing to abide by this principle in the future, and can obstruct Chinese journalists from entering the country at any time, which can also be proved in the U.S. State Department statement on September 8.

The U.S. side's draft does not mention the purpose of Sino-U.S. journalist exchange, which is by no means an accidental oversight. The Chinese government has always believed that Sino-U.S. journalist exchange on an equal and reciprocal basis can only be conducive to enhancing mutual understanding between the people of the two countries and helping to improve relations between the two countries. It is very necessary to determine these purposes in the agreement between the two sides, especially given the U.S. government's consistent policy of hostility towards China, it is even more necessary to do so. However, the U.S. draft does not mention the purpose of the exchange of journalists between the two countries at all, which cannot but make people wonder what the U.S. intention is in demanding to exchange journalists with China.

The U.S. side's draft takes the form of separate statements by the ambassadors of the two countries. We remember that the agreement between the two sides on the issue of civilians returning home also took this form. However, the fact that the U.S. side has not seriously implemented this agreement to this day shows that this form is not binding enough on the U.S. side. In order to prevent the U.S. side from breaking the agreement again, the Chinese side firmly maintains that all agreements between the two sides must take the form of a joint statement by both sides, and no longer take the form of separate statements by each side.

For the above reasons, the Chinese side rejected the U.S. draft at the 100th meeting of the Sino-U.S. talks held on September 7, and put forward a new draft agreement statement, the full text of which is as follows:

"Ambassador Wang Bingnan, representing the Government of the People's Republic of China, and Ambassador Beam, representing the Government of the United States of America, agree to declare:

In order to seek to eliminate the estrangement between the people of China and the United States, to initially improve the current relations between the two countries, and to further promote the peaceful resolution of the issue of the complete withdrawal of the U.S. armed forces from China's territory Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area, in accordance with the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, the two governments agree to the following articles so that journalists from both sides can conduct news coverage in each other's countries on an equal and reciprocal basis.

(1) The two governments agree that national journalists who wish to conduct news coverage in the other country must apply for approval from the government of the other country; each time the two governments approve the entry of the other's journalists, the number must be equal.

(2) The two governments agree not to obstruct the entry of approved journalists from the other country with any existing or future laws and regulations.

(3) The two governments agree that journalists from the other country who are approved to enter their country shall enjoy the same news coverage facilities as national journalists enjoy in the other country.

(4) The two governments guarantee that national journalists entering the other country for news coverage will not engage in activities that violate the purposes stated in the preamble to this agreement."

After the Chinese side put forward this draft, the U.S. side rejected it on the spot without thinking. This completely exposed the true attitude of the U.S. government on the issue of Sino-U.S. journalist exchange.

The Chinese side's draft clearly states in the preamble the purpose of the Sino-U.S. exchange of journalists: to seek to eliminate the estrangement between the people of China and the United States, to initially improve the current relations between the two countries, and to further promote the peaceful resolution of the issue of the complete withdrawal of the U.S. armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area in accordance with the five principles of peaceful coexistence. These are clearly the common wishes of those who want to see improved relations between China and the United States, and the Sino-U.S. exchange of journalists is a preliminary step to make these wishes a reality. The U.S. government's refusal to agree to the purposes set by the Chinese government for the exchange of journalists between the two countries proves exactly that the U.S. government does not want to eliminate the estrangement between the people of the two countries, is unwilling to improve relations between the two countries, and wants to continue to occupy China's territory Taiwan by force.

The Chinese side's draft proposes the principle of equality and reciprocity in the preamble, and then stipulates various specific measures in the four articles of the text to ensure the full implementation of this principle. It should be pointed out that these four articles are binding on both parties. The U.S. side refuses to agree to these articles, but cannot give any tenable reasons. This can only show that the U.S. government is fundamentally unwilling to accept the principle of equality and reciprocity.

Now, the situation is very clear. The purpose of the U.S. government on the issue of Sino-U.S. journalist exchange is not to enhance the understanding between the people of China and the United States and improve relations between the two countries, but other ulterior motives. The U.S. government has no intention of letting Chinese journalists go to the United States on an equal and reciprocal basis, but wants to send American journalists to China to carry out activities according to its ulterior motives. No matter how the U.S. government distorts the course of events, it can never escape the full responsibility for obstructing the Sino-U.S. exchange of journalists.

In the past, the Chinese government has imagined that although the fundamental improvement of Sino-U.S. relations lies in solving the fundamental problems between China and the United States, and first of all in the United States agreeing to withdraw all its armed forces from China's territory Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area, the two sides can also first negotiate some relatively minor issues and reach fair and reasonable agreements in order to create favorable conditions for solving the fundamental problems between China and the United States. To this end, the Chinese side has successively proposed a series of reasonable suggestions in the past one hundred meetings of the Sino-U.S. talks, such as eliminating obstacles to trade between the two countries, eliminating obstacles to cultural exchanges and personnel exchanges between the two countries, and exchanging journalists on an equal and reciprocal basis. It is very regrettable that these suggestions have been unreasonably rejected by the U.S. government time and time again. Facts have proved that as long as the U.S. government still adheres to its policy of hostility towards China and aggression against China, still insists on occupying China's territory Taiwan by force, and continues to conspire to create "two Chinas," all the efforts made by the Chinese side to solve individual problems first are in vain. From the experience of the five years and one hundred Sino-U.S. talks, the Chinese side cannot but draw the following conclusion: in the future, there is no need to waste time on minor issues in the talks, but should first focus on solving the fundamental problems between China and the United States, that is, the issue of the U.S. government agreeing to resolve the disputes between China and the United States through peaceful negotiations without resorting to force or threat of force, and the issue of the U.S. government agreeing to withdraw all its armed forces from China's territory Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area. Although the U.S. side has not shown the slightest sincerity so far, the Chinese side will continue to make the greatest efforts in the talks as it has done in the past five years.

### 我外交部新闻司发言人发表声明  就中美互换记者问题驳美国国务院

    我外交部新闻司发言人发表声明
    就中美互换记者问题驳美国国务院
    新华社13日讯　中华人民共和国外交部新闻司发言人今天就中美两国互换记者问题发表声明，驳斥美国国务院9月8日就这个问题发表的一项完全歪曲事实和颠倒黑白的声明。外交部新闻司发言人的声明全文如下：
    1960年9月8日，美国国务院就中美两国互换记者问题发表声明，硬说美国一直在进行努力，设法在平等互惠基础上同中国互换记者，而中国却不愿意这样做。同日，美国国务卿赫脱在合众国际社编辑和发行人会议上就同一问题发表了类似的讲话。这些声明和讲话完全是歪曲事实和颠倒黑白。
    中国政府为了促成中美两国互换记者，曾经作了不懈的努力，而美国政府却始终无理地加以反对和阻挠。早在1956年秋季至1957年春季，中国政府就先后批准了三十九名美国记者前来中国采访新闻。由于美国政府的禁令，这三十九名美国记者中，只有三名不顾禁令来到了中国。这三名记者在回国以后，又都被吊销了护照。美国政府禁止美国记者前来中国的这种横暴做法，使它处于非常被动的地位。因此，它后来不得不改变做法。它一方面批准某些经过挑选的美国新闻机构派记者到中国来，以便保证这些记者按照它的指示进行活动；另一方面，它采取了极端狂妄的帝国主义态度，拒绝根据平等互惠的原则让中国记者到美国去采访新闻。1957年8月22日，美国国务院发表公报说，美国将不会给中国记者互惠签证。同年8月27日，美国故国务卿杜勒斯更公然声称，不承认中国方面有权提出互惠的要求。为了使美国政府懂得并且遵守国际交往中起码的行为准则，为了纠正它的帝国主义态度，中国政府坚决主张，中美双方必须首先达成在平等互惠基础上互换记者的正式协议。1957年9月12日，中国方面根据这种主张在中美会谈中提出了一个协议声明草案。但是三年来，美国方面一直以美国法律不能给予中国记者以互惠待遇为借口，拒绝接受中国方面的这个建议。
    美国政府这种公开反对平等互惠原则、阻挠中美互换记者的立场，在长时期内遭到全世界舆论、包括美国新闻界在内的严正谴责。因此，它直到最近才不得不采取新的欺骗手法。在今年6月7日的第九十八次中美会谈中，美国方面提出了下述的关于中美两国交换记者的协议草案：
    “美利坚合众国政府，在宪法和美国现行的有关法律和条例的范围内，并按照平等互惠原则，将接受中华人民共和国的记者进入美国，以便能直接报道美国的情况。被接受进入美国的中华人民共和国的记者，将被给予同一般给予在美国的外国记者一样的、作新闻报道的便利。”
    美国方面的这个草案，从表面上看来，似乎是接受了中国方面提出的平等互惠原则。但是，只要对这个草案稍加分析，就可以看出，美国政府丝毫没有放弃拒绝遵守平等互惠原则的一贯立场。美国方面在这个草案中首先提出，美国政府接受中国记者进入美国，要“在宪法和美国现行的有关法律和条例的范围内”。这显然是别有用心的。美国政府过去曾经多次明白地表示，根据美国的移民法，美国不能保证给予中国方面所建议的那种互惠。可见，美国方面在草案中提出所谓“在宪法和美国现行的有关法律和条例的范围内”，不仅否定了草案中同时提到的“平等互惠原则”，而且正是为了将来拒绝遵守这个原则而留下一个借口，随时可以阻难中国记者入境，这在9月8日美国国务院声明中也可得到证明。
    美国方面的草案只字不提中美两国互换记者的宗旨，这决不是一个偶然的疏忽。中国政府始终认为，中美两国在平等互惠的基础上互换记者，只能是为了有利于增进两国人民的相互了解和有助于两国关系的改善。在双方的协议中把这些宗旨确定下来，是十分必要的，特别是鉴于美国政府一贯采取敌视中国的政策，这样做就更加有必要。可是美方草案根本不提两国互换记者的目的，这就不能不令人怀疑，美国要求同中国交换记者的用意究竟何在。
    美国方面的草案采取了两国大使分别发表声明的形式。我们记得，双方关于平民回国问题的协议，也是采取这种形式。但是，美国方面至今没有认真执行这一协议的事实说明，这种形式对美国方面的约束力是不够的。为了防止美国方面再次破坏协议，中国方面坚决主张，双方的一切协议，都必须采取双方共同声明的形式，而不再采取各方分别发表声明的形式。
    根据上述原因，中国方面在9月7日举行的中美会谈第一百次会议上拒绝了美国方面的草案，并且提出了一个新的协议声明草案，全文如下：
      “王炳南大使代表中华人民共和国政府，比姆大使代表美利坚合众国政府，协议声明：
    为了设法消除中美两国人民之间的隔阂，初步改善目前两国的关系，并且进一步促使两国根据互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则，和平解决美国武装部队从中国领土台湾和台湾海峡地区全部撤出的问题，两国政府协议以下各条，使双方的新闻记者得以在平等互惠的基础上到对方的国家进行新闻采访。
      （一）两国政府同意，愿意到对方国家进行新闻采访的本国新闻记者，必须向对方国家的政府申请批准；每次两国政府批准入境的对方新闻记者，必须人数相等。
      （二）两国政府同意，不以现行的或今后制定的任何法律和条例阻难被批准的对方新闻记者入境。
      （三）两国政府同意，被批准进入本国的对方新闻记者，将享受本国的新闻记者在对方国家所享受的同样的采访新闻的便利。
      （四）两国政府保证，进入对方国家进行新闻采访的本国新闻记者，将不进行违反本协议序言所述宗旨的活动。”
    中国方面提出这个草案以后，美国方面竟不加思考地当场加以拒绝。这就完全暴露了美国政府在中美两国互换记者问题上的真正态度。
    中国方面的草案在序言部分明确地说明了中美互换记者的目的是，设法消除中美两国人民之间的隔阂，初步改善目前两国的关系，并且进一步促使两国根据和平共处的五项原则，和平解决美国武装部队从台湾和台湾海峡地区全部撤出的问题。这些显然是愿意看到中美两国改善关系的人的共同愿望，而中美互换记者正是促使这些愿望成为现实的一个初步的步骤。美国政府拒绝同意中国政府为两国交换记者所确定的目的，恰好证明，美国政府不想消除两国人民之间的隔阂，不愿意改善两国的关系，而且还要继续用武力霸占中国的领土台湾。
    中国方面的草案在序言部分提出平等互惠的原则，然后在本文的四个条款中规定了各项具体办法，保证这个原则的充分实施。应该指出，这四个条款对双方都是有约束力的。美国方面拒绝同意这些条款，但是又举不出任何站得住的理由。这只能说明，美国政府根本不愿意接受平等互惠原则。
    现在，情况已经非常清楚。美国政府在中美互换记者问题上所抱的目的，根本不是增进中美两国人民的了解和改善两国的关系，而是另外的不可告人的目的。美国政府根本无意在平等互惠的基础上让中国记者到美国去，而是要按照它的不可告人的目的，派美国记者到中国来进行活动。不论美国政府怎样歪曲事实的发展经过，它绝对无法逃脱阻挠中美两国交换记者的全部责任。
    过去，中国政府曾经设想，虽然中美两国关系的根本改善，在于解决中美两国间的根本性问题，而且首先在于美国同意把它的一切武装力量撤出中国的领土台湾和台湾海峡地区，但是双方也可以先就一些比较次要的问题进行商谈，达成公平合理的协议，以便为解决中美两国之间的根本性问题创造有利的条件。为此，中国方面在中美会谈过去的一百次会议中，曾经先后提出过消除两国贸易的障碍，消除两国文化交流和人员往来的障碍以及在平等互惠基础上互换记者等等一系列的合理建议。令人十分遗憾的是，这些建议都遭到美国政府一次又一次的无理拒绝。事实证明，只要美国政府仍然坚持敌视中国和侵略中国的政策，仍然坚持以武力霸占中国的领土台湾，并且继续阴谋制造“两个中国”，中国方面为了首先解决个别问题而做的一切努力，都是枉然。从五年、一百次的中美会谈的经验中，中国方面不能不得出这样的结论：今后在会谈中没有必要再在次要的问题上浪费时间，而应该首先致力于解决中美两国之间的根本性问题，那就是美国政府同意通过和平谈判解决中美两国之间的争端而不诉诸武力或武力威胁的问题和美国政府同意把它的武装部队从中国领土台湾和台湾海峡地区全部撤出的问题。尽管美国方面至今没有表现出丝毫的诚意，中国方面将同过去五年一样，继续在会谈中作出最大的努力。
