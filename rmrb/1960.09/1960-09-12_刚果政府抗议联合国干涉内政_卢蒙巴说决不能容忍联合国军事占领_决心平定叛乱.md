Xinhua News Agency, Léopoldville, 10th: Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba today read out a letter of appeal from the Congolese government to the President of the United Nations Security Council, member states of the Security Council, and member states of the United Nations at a press conference, strongly condemning the United Nations for interfering in the internal affairs of the Congo.

The appeal stated that the UN Secretary-General's speech at the UN Security Council, claiming that "Kasavubu has the right to dissolve the government," confirms the UN's blatant interference in the internal affairs of the Congo.

The appeal stated that the Government of the Republic of the Congo once again protests against the UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld's blatant interference in the internal affairs of the Congolese nation; this interference not only dangerously damages the UN's credibility and prestige in the Congo, but also in Africa and even the world.

The appeal stated that the Congolese government demands that the United Nations "stop directly or indirectly interfering in the internal affairs of the Republic of the Congo" and requests that the Security Council not adopt any other resolutions on the Congo issue, as previous resolutions have not been fully implemented due to the Belgian government and its allies continuing to provide direct assistance (aircraft, weapons, ammunition, liaison officers and commanding officers) to the illegal rebel government in Katanga.

The appeal stated that the Congolese government most strongly protests the UN Secretary-General's attempt to disarm the National Army. The appeal also revealed that the purpose of the United Nations in creating conflict in the Congo is to "place the Congo under international trusteeship."

The appeal stated that Hammarskjöld "so arbitrarily occupied our national radio station and all airports of the Republic because the Secretary-General is attempting to deprive the government of the means of broadcasting and propaganda through this practice, and to enable Tshombe and some illegal elements to succeed in their conspiracy to stage a coup through privately established radio stations in Léopoldville recently. These privately established radio stations are carrying out anti-government propaganda, spreading lies, and engaging in slander and defamation every day, with the aim of undermining and discrediting the legally established government supported by the broad masses of the people."

Prime Minister Lumumba also read out a telegram from the Speaker of the House of Representatives to the Security Council on this issue.

After reading out the appeal, Lumumba addressed the representatives of African countries present. He said, "We must not tolerate the military occupation of the United Nations." He condemned the illegal decision of the UN forces to close airports and radio stations. Lumumba said, "The United Nations has no right to do this in the Congo." He pointed out that this shows that the United Nations is trying to occupy the Congo.

He also asked African countries to assist the Congo. He said, "Now is the time for African countries that have sent troops to the Congo under the command of the United Nations to decide whether to withdraw from the headquarters."

He said, "As an autonomous country, the Congo cannot tolerate UN interference in its internal affairs."

According to reports, representatives of other African countries in Léopoldville also expressed disapproval of the UN Secretary-General's speech. The head of the Guinean delegation to the Congo, Tounkara, said that only the Congolese Parliament has the right to "interpret the Congolese Constitution."

The Congolese public is extremely dissatisfied with the UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld's speech at the Security Council meeting. People believe that Hammarskjöld's statement that President Kasavubu "has the right" to dissolve Prime Minister Lumumba's cabinet is a very dangerous interference in the internal affairs of the Congo and an "infringement of the country's sovereignty."

Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Léopoldville News: Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba issued a statement announcing the Congolese government's determination to continue the struggle to quell the secessionist groups in Kasai Province and Katanga Province to the end. The statement also said, "The government will rely on its own strength to restore order in the country in the near future."

Lumumba's statement was issued by Bolamba, Secretary of State of the Congolese Government Information Department, in Léopoldville on the 10th.

The statement said that the Congolese government forces are still fighting the Tshombe group in Katanga Province.

The statement said that the Congolese army will continue to achieve great success, "if the United Nations does not obstruct their actions, and the United Nations' obstruction is part of its entire interference in the internal affairs of this country."

The statement said, "I once again request the United Nations authorities to cease all interference in the internal affairs of this Republic."

In his statement, Lumumba denied the rumors spread by "UN" personnel that the Congolese government had "ceased fire" in Kasai and Katanga, and refuted the claim that "Congolese troops have not been paid for two months." He said, "Until the end of last month, the government had been paying soldiers regularly."

According to Reuters, earlier that day, a "UN" spokesperson actually announced in Léopoldville: "The Congolese Army has ordered a comprehensive ceasefire throughout the Congo, including Katanga," in order to disrupt the Congolese army's actions to quell the Tshombe group.

According to Reuters, the Congolese government forces, ordered to quell the Tshombe group, also engaged in a battle with Tshombe's reactionary troops on the border between Kivu Province and Katanga Province on the 9th. The battle took place on the highway north of Albertville, near Lake Tanganyika.

Xinhua News Agency, Léopoldville, 8th: "Congo Daily" published an editorial today saying: The Congo will never be placed under "trusteeship" by the United Nations.

The newspaper said: "According to reports in American and Western newspapers, people are talking about placing our republic under the trusteeship of the United Nations."

The newspaper said, "The Katanga Province issue, the Kasai Province issue, and other issues, on the surface, the problems originate in the Congo, but in reality, they are instigated from the outside."

The newspaper pointed out that the Congo became an independent country on June 30, 1960. This is only political independence. Regarding economic independence, "those who have financial and economic interests are unwilling to let Africa truly achieve economic independence."

The newspaper demanded that all leaders of the Congo should oppose turning the Congo from its past "subordinate status to Belgium into a colony of the United Nations." It said, "Our republic must be governed by our people, not by foreigners, whether foreigners from the United Nations or other foreigners."

    刚果政府抗议联合国干涉内政
    卢蒙巴说决不能容忍联合国军事占领　决心平定叛乱
    新华社利奥波德维尔10日电刚果总理卢蒙巴今天在记者招待会上宣读了一份刚果政府给联合国安全理事会主席、安理会成员国和联合国会员国的呼吁书，强烈谴责联合国干涉刚果内政。
    呼吁书说，联合国秘书长在联合国安全理事会的讲话中声称“卡萨武布有权解散政府”，证实了联合国公然干涉刚果内政。
    呼吁书说，刚果共和国政府再次抗议联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德公然干涉刚果国家的内政；这种干涉不仅危险地损害联合国在刚果而且在非洲，甚至在全世界的信誉和威望。
    呼吁书说，刚果政府要求联合国“停止直接或间接干涉刚果共和国的内政”，并且要求安全理事会不要就刚果问题通过任何其他的决议，因为过去通过的各项决议由于比利时政府及其同盟者继续向加丹加的非法叛乱政府提供直接的援助（飞机、武器、弹药、联络军官和指挥作战的军官等）使这些决议没有完全执行。
    呼吁书说，刚果政府最强烈地抗议联合国秘书长妄图解除国民军的武装。呼吁书还揭露联合国在刚果制造冲突的目的是“把刚果置于国际托管之下”。
    呼吁书说，哈马舍尔德“所以要专横地霸占我们的国家电台以及共和国的一切机场，是由于秘书长企图通过这种做法来剥夺政府的广播和宣传的手段，并使冲伯、使一些非法之徒最近在利奥波德维尔私下设立的广播电台搞政变的阴谋得逞。这些私设的电台每天在大肆进行反政府的宣传，散播谎言，进行诽谤和污蔑，其目的是要破坏中伤依法建立并得到广大人民群众支持的政府。”
    卢蒙巴总理还宣读了众议院议长就这个问题打给安全理事会的电报。
    卢蒙巴在宣读呼吁书以后向在场的非洲国家代表讲了话。他说，“我们决不能容忍联合国的军事占领。”他谴责联合国军封闭机场和电台的非法决定。卢蒙巴说，“联合国没有权利在刚果这样做。”他指出，这表明联合国企图占领刚果。
    他还要求非洲国家援助刚果。他说，“现在该是在联合国指挥下派兵到刚果的非洲国家决定是否退出司令部的时候了。”
    他说，“作为一个自主的国家，刚果不能容忍联合国干涉自己的内政。”
    据报道，在利奥波德维尔的其他非洲国家代表也对联合国秘书长的演说表示不赞成。几内亚驻刚果代表团团长通卡拉说，只有刚果议会有权“解释刚果宪法”。
    刚果公众对于联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在安全理事会会议上的演说感到极为不满。人们认为哈马舍尔德所谓卡萨武布总统“有权”解散卢蒙巴总理内阁的说法是对刚果内政进行的非常危险的干涉，并且是“侵犯这个国家的主权”。
    新华社11日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果总理卢蒙巴发表一项声明，宣布刚果政府决心把讨伐开赛省和加丹加省分裂集团的斗争继续进行到底。声明并且说，“政府将依靠它自己的力量最近在国内恢复秩序”。
    卢蒙巴的这项声明是通过刚果政府新闻部国务秘书博兰巴10日在利奥波德维尔发表的。
    声明说，刚果政府军仍在加丹加省讨伐冲伯集团。
    声明说，刚果军队将继续取得很大的成功，“如果联合国不阻挠他们的行动，而联合国的阻挠行动是它整个干涉这个国家内政的一部分”。
    声明说，“我再度请求联合国当局停止对这个共和国内政的一切干涉。”
    卢蒙巴在声明中否认“联合国”人士散布的关于刚果政府已在开赛和加丹加“停火”的谣言，并驳斥了关于“刚果军队两个月没有得到军饷”的说法。他说，“到上月底为止，政府一直定期地发给士兵军饷”。
    据路透社报道，当天早些时候，“联合国”发言人竟在利奥波德维尔宣布：“刚果陆军已经下令在刚果全国包括加丹加在内实行全面停火”，以便破坏刚果军队讨伐冲伯集团的行动。
    据路透社消息，奉命讨伐冲伯集团的刚果政府军9日还在基伍省和加丹加省的边界上同冲伯的反动军队进行了一次战斗。战斗发生在阿尔伯特维尔以北、靠近坦噶尼喀湖附近的公路上。
    新华社利奥波德维尔8日电“刚果日报”今天发表社论说：刚果决不会受联合国的“托管”。
    这家报纸说：“根据美国和西方报纸的报道，人们在纷纷谈论把我们共和国置于联合国托管之下”。
    这家报纸说，“加丹加省问题、开赛省问题以及其他问题，表面上问题起源于刚果，而实际上是外部指使的。”
    这家报纸指出，刚果在1960年6月30日成为独立国家。这只是政治独立。关于经济独立，“拥有财政和经济利益的那些人，不愿意让非洲真正在经济上获得独立”。
    这家报纸要求刚果的所有领导人应当反对把刚果从过去“从属于比利时的地位变成联合国的殖民地”。它说，“我们的共和国必须由我国人民来治理，不能由外国人来管，不管是联合国的外国人还是别的外国人。”
