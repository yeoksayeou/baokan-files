Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 22nd: The Dashiqiao Iron Mine of the Shaodong Iron Plant in Shaodong County, Hunan Province, has persisted in the principle of relying mainly on indigenous methods, vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution in the mine, and has achieved remarkable results. In early September, the number of new tools promoted and used throughout the mine increased from 81 in June to 135, achieving the goal of promoting one and using one, resulting in sustained high production of ore.

The Dashiqiao Iron Mine is an open-pit iron mine built in 1958 using indigenous methods. The mine's leadership resolutely relied on the masses and adopted indigenous methods to carry out mine technical transformation. In just over a year, 48 indigenous railways were built for transportation, totaling more than 4,800 meters in length. They used 54 self-made indigenous mine carts on flat ground, automatic cable cars on slopes, animal-powered winches uphill, indigenous cranes for lifting, funnels for loading, tunnels through mountains, and sky bridges across gullies. In terms of mining, they manufactured various types of indigenous drilling machines for flat, inclined, straight, and overhead blasting. These indigenous tools were simple and practical, greatly improving labor efficiency. Now, the total number of production workers in the mine has been reduced from 580 last year to 190. By the end of August, the mine had produced more than 92,100 tons of ore, an increase of 1.7 times compared to the same period last year, exceeding this year's ore production plan by 53.4%. In addition to fully meeting the needs of the five small blast furnaces of the Shaodong Iron Plant, it also supported the Xianchaqiao Iron Plant in the county with some ore. Currently, the mine has a reserve of more than 7,000 tons of ore, enough for the small blast furnaces of these two iron plants to use for more than a month.

The leadership of this mine regards strengthening the management and maintenance of new tools as one of the important measures to consolidate, promote, and improve new tools. In addition to having dedicated personnel to use and manage each new tool, the mine also organized 16 people, including ironworkers, carpenters, and technicians, to form a comprehensive maintenance team. They adopted a method combining key repairs with on-site repairs in each production area, ensuring that minor repairs were completed in a timely manner and major repairs were completed overnight. Now, the workers of this mine have also formulated operating procedures for the new tools in production practice, greatly reducing tool damage accidents and ensuring the continuous consolidation, development, and improvement of technological innovation achievements.

Recently, the Hunan Provincial Metallurgical Department convened a provincial-level on-site meeting on ferrous metal mining to promote the experience of the Dashiqiao Iron Mine.

　　大石桥铁矿土工具发挥大威力
    工人减少三分之二，产量增加一点七倍
    据新华社长沙22日电　湖南省邵东县邵东铁厂大石桥铁矿坚持以土法为主的方针，大搞矿山技术革新和技术革命，取得显著效果。9月上旬，全矿推广、使用的新工具由6月份的八十一件增加到一百三十五件，做到了推广一件，使用一件，矿石生产获得了持续高产。
    大石桥铁矿是1958年兴建的土法露天开采的铁矿。矿的领导方面，坚决依靠群众，并采取土办法进行矿山技术改造，仅仅经过一年多的时间，在运输方面就修筑了四十八条土轨道，共长四千八百多米，在平地上用上了自己制造的五十四辆土矿车，斜坡有自动滑车，上山有畜力卷扬机，提升有土起重机，装车有漏斗，穿山有地道，跨沟有天桥；在采掘方面制造了打平炮、斜炮、直炮、顶炮等各式各样的土打眼机。这些土工具简易适用，大大提高了劳动效率。现在全矿的生产工人已由去年的五百八十人减少到一百九十人。到8月底止，全矿已经生产矿石九万二千一百多吨，比去年同期增长一点七倍，超额53.4％完成了今年矿石生产计划，除能充分满足邵东铁厂五座小高炉需要以外，还以部分矿石支援了本县的仙槎桥铁厂。目前矿里储备了七千多吨矿石，足够这二个铁厂的小高炉用一个多月。
    这个矿的领导部门把加强对新工具的保管和维修，作为巩固、推广、提高新工具的重要措施之一。每一件新工具除有专人使用和保管以外，矿里还组织了铁、木工和技术员等十六人成立了综合维修组，采取重点修理和带工具箱上山到各生产垱头巡回修理相结合的办法，做到了小修不过时，大修不过夜。现在这个矿的工人还在生产实践中制定了新工具的操作规程，大大减少了工具损坏事故，保证了技术革新成果的不断巩固、发展和提高。
    最近，湖南省冶金厅召开了全省性的黑色金属采掘现场会，推广大石桥铁矿的经验。
