Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 18th: African figures in Cairo continue to condemn the imperialist plot to undermine Congolese independence and unity, and emphasize that U.S. imperialism is the enemy of African freedom and independence.

Okelo, Director of the Kenyan Office in Cairo, told Xinhua News Agency today that the new developments in the Congo situation are just another imperialist plot to undermine the independence and territorial integrity of the Congo. The imperialists have tried every means to remove Lumumba, who truly represents the Congolese Africans' desire for independence and freedom, from power. This further exposes the fact that the imperialists, headed by the United States, are the enemies of African freedom and independence.

Okelo said that Kenyan youth are ready to go to the Congo as volunteers at any time to fight against the imperialists and for the independence of the Congo.

Okelo demanded that the armies of independent African countries not obey the orders of the so-called "United Nations Command" to fight against their brothers, the Congolese Africans, and called on African countries to help the Congo financially and militarily.

Piliso, the representative of the South African Office in Cairo, also condemned the imperialist interference in the Congo's internal affairs. Piliso told Xinhua News Agency today that they only support one Congolese government, that is, the Lumumba government, which represents the will of the Congolese people.

Senionga, the representative of the Ugandan Office in Cairo, said that they only recognize the Lumumba government because it received a majority vote in the parliamentary vote of confidence. Senionga demanded that all African troops immediately withdraw from the "UN forces" to protest the UN's policy in the Congo.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 18th: Ali Sultan Issa, Chief Representative of the Zanzibar Office in Cairo, told Xinhua News Agency reporters today, "The current situation in the Congo has undoubtedly revealed the vicious conspiracy of U.S. imperialism."

He said, "U.S. imperialism is using the United Nations forces to carry out its imperialist conspiracy, attempting to exploit the Congo and turn it into a colony. This is a clear sign that all Africans should see and guard against. We should be vigilant against U.S. imperialism, the number one enemy of the people of all countries."

Issa said that some Africans believe that they can ask the United States to help them oppose Britain or other colonialists to gain freedom. Now they can understand that the imperialists' nature of exploiting the people is exactly the same. U.S. imperialism even uses the United Nations organization to achieve this goal.

He called on the people of African countries to unite and remain vigilant against U.S. imperialism. He pointed out that this is because U.S. imperialism is the most vicious and dangerous enemy of the African people and the people all over the world.

Issa expressed his belief that no matter what actions U.S. imperialism may take, the Congolese government headed by Lumumba will win because it has the full support of the people, while the U.S. imperialists can only buy some lackeys who do not have the support of the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 18th: Ernest Ouandié, Vice Chairman of the Cameroon People's Union, strongly condemned the American conspiracy in the Congo and expressed his full support for the legitimate Congolese government headed by Lumumba.

He told Xinhua News Agency reporters here today that every day there are confusing, contradictory and shocking news from Leopoldville; however, all these news involve the conspiracies of U.S. imperialists. The open purpose of these conspiracies is to undermine the independence and national sovereignty of the Congo.

He pointed out that the United Nations controlled by U.S. imperialism is just a veil, behind which conspiracies to undermine Congolese sovereignty are being planned. Ouandié condemned UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld for acting as a spokesman for the imperialists with his shocking actions. He said that Hammarskjöld even prevented government troops from landing in Leopoldville, but provided United Nations protection to all rebellions against the Congolese nationalist government.

Ouandié finally said that the Cameroonian people, who are engaged in armed struggle against a common enemy, fully support the legitimate Congolese government headed by Lumumba, and nothing can stop the African people from advancing gloriously on the road to complete liberation.

    非洲各国人士纷纷就刚果局势发表谈话
    美帝国主义是非洲自由和独立的敌人
    非洲国家应该立即把军队撤出“联合国军”并加强对刚果人民的支持
    新华社开罗18日电　在开罗的非洲人士继续谴责帝国主义破坏刚果独立和统一的阴谋，并强调指出，美帝国主义是非洲自由和独立的敌人。
    怯尼亚驻开罗办事处主任奥凯洛今天对新华社记者说，刚果形势的新发展只不过是帝国主义企图破坏刚果的独立和领土完整的又一阴谋而已。帝国主义者曾千方百计地企图把真正代表刚果非洲人独立和自由愿望的卢蒙巴赶下台去。这就更加揭露出以美国为首的帝国主义者是非洲自由和独立的敌人。
    奥凯洛说，怯尼亚青年准备随时以志愿军的身份到刚果去为反对帝国主义者和争取刚果的独立而斗争。
    奥凯洛要求非洲独立国家的军队不要听从所谓“联合国司令部”的命令来同他们的兄弟——刚果的非洲人——作战，并呼吁非洲国家在财政上和军事上帮助刚果。
    南非驻开罗的办事处代表皮利索也谴责帝国主义者对刚果内政的干涉。皮利索今天对新华社记者说，他们只支持一个刚果政府，那就是代表刚果人民意志的卢蒙巴政府。
    乌干达驻开罗的办事处代表塞尼翁加说，他们只承认卢蒙巴政府，因为它在议会信任投票中获得多数票。塞尼翁加要求一切非洲军队立即从“联合国军”中撤出以抗议联合国在刚果的政策。
    据新华社开罗18日电　桑给巴尔驻开罗办事处首席代表阿里·苏丹·伊萨今天接见新华社记者时说，“目前刚果的形势已经无庸置疑地表明了美帝国主义的恶毒的阴谋。”
    他说，“美帝国主义利用联合国部队推行它的帝国主义阴谋，企图剥削刚果并使之成为殖民地。这是一切非洲人应该看到和加以提防的一个明显的迹象，对世界各国人民的第一号敌人美帝国主义应该提高警惕。”
    伊萨说，某些非洲人认为，他们能够要求美国帮助他们反对英国或其他殖民主义者而取得自由，现在他们可以明白，帝国主义者剥削人民的本性完全是同样的，美帝国主义甚至利用联合国组织来达到这种目的。
    他要求非洲各国人民团结起来并保持警惕以反对美帝国主义。他指出，这是因为美帝国主义是非洲人民和全世界人民最恶毒和最危险的敌人。
    伊萨表示相信，不管美帝国主义可能采取什么行动，以卢蒙巴为首的刚果政府将取得胜利，因为它得到人民的完全支持，而美帝国主义者只能收买一些得不到人民支持的走狗。
    新华社开罗18日电　喀麦隆人民联盟副主席欧内斯·乌安迪强烈谴责美国在刚果的阴谋，并表示完全支持以卢蒙巴为首的合法的刚果政府。
    他今天在这里对新华社记者说，每天都有混乱、矛盾和惊人的消息从利奥波德维尔传来；可是，所有这些消息都涉及美帝国主义者的阴谋。这些阴谋公开的目的在于破坏刚果的独立和国家主权。
    他指出，美帝国主义控制的联合国只不过是一层帷幕，在这种帷幕后面正在策划破坏刚果主权的阴谋。乌安迪谴责联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德以其惊人的行动充当了帝国主义者的发言人。他说，哈马舍尔德甚至阻止政府军队在利奥波德维尔降陆，却对那些反对刚果民族主义政府的一切叛乱活动提供联合国的保护。
    乌安迪最后说，正在进行武装斗争反对共同敌人的喀麦隆人民全力支持以卢蒙巴为首的合法的刚果政府，任何东西都不能阻止非洲人民向着完全解放的道路光荣地前进。
