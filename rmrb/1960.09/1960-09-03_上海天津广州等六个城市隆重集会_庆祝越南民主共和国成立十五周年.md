Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 2nd: More than 1,000 people from all walks of life in Shanghai held a grand gathering on the evening of the 1st to warmly celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

　　The celebration meeting was held at the Xinhua Cinema. Chen Pixian, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC and Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, Shi Ximin, Alternate Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, and other leaders of the Shanghai Municipal Party and Government, as well as heads of Shanghai people's organizations and directors of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association in Shanghai attended the meeting.

　　Cao Diqiu spoke at the meeting. He said: "The Vietnamese people waged a relentless struggle for national independence and freedom against the colonialists for nearly a century, and finally won victory. In the fifteen years since the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnamese people have heroically persisted in the national revolutionary war for nine years. After the restoration of peace, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people have been creating their own happy life at an extremely rapid pace on the ruins of war, and have achieved brilliant achievements in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. These brilliant achievements have not only laid a good foundation for consolidating North Vietnam, building socialism, and striving for national reunification, but have also strengthened the power of the entire socialist camp."

　　Cao Diqiu said: "The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently and faithfully fulfilled the Geneva Accords, and has made unremitting efforts to maintain peace in Indochina and achieve the reunification of the motherland. However, for more than six years, U.S. imperialism and its running dog Ngo Dinh Diem clique have consistently and blatantly violated the Geneva Accords, obstructed the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and have continuously created tension in the Indochina region. This clearly shows that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of China and Vietnam, the people of all Asian countries, and the people of the whole world."

　　Vietnamese students and interns in Shanghai also attended today's celebration meeting.

　　Consuls of various countries stationed in Shanghai also attended the celebration meeting.
