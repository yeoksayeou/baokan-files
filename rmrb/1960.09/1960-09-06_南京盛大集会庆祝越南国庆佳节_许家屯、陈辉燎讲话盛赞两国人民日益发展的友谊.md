Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 5th: More than 1,000 people from all walks of life in Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City held a grand rally this afternoon to warmly celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Among those attending the celebration were Xu Jiatun, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and Vice Governor of Jiangsu Province, Peng Chong, Alternate Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, Guan Wenwei and Zhou Yifeng, Vice Governors of Jiangsu Province, Chen Yang, Secretary of the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee and Mayor of Nanjing, Liu Zhong, Secretary of the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee, Wang Zhaoquan, Vice Mayor of Nanjing, and heads of various people's organizations of the province and city.

The entire delegation of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, headed by Chen Huiliao, attended the celebration. Vietnamese interns and students in Nanjing also attended the meeting.

Xu Jiatun spoke at the meeting. On behalf of the people of Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City, he warmly congratulated the heroic Vietnamese people on their festival. He enthusiastically praised the great achievements made by the Vietnamese people under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and President Ho Chi Minh in all aspects over the past fifteen years. He pointed out that American imperialism has consistently obstructed and undermined the unification of Vietnam, attempting to divide Vietnam for a long time, occupy South Vietnam, and turn South Vietnam into a colony and a base for launching aggressive wars. He said that it is obvious that American imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world.

Xu Jiatun said: Now, we are excited to see that the Vietnamese people's anti-American struggle is surging forward. In South Vietnam, more and more people are standing up and launching a heroic struggle against American imperialism and its running dogs. We firmly believe that the Vietnamese people, who once frightened the imperialists in the world-shaking "Dien Bien Phu Campaign," will, with the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people and countries, be able to drive away the American imperialist aggressors with the same heroic and tenacious struggle and realize the sacred desire of unifying their motherland. Xu Jiatun also expressed his conviction that the militant friendship and unity formed by the people of China and Vietnam in their common struggle, under the revolutionary banner of Marxism-Leninism, in the common cause of building socialism, and in the struggle against the imperialist policy of war and aggression and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world, will continue to be consolidated and developed.

Commander Chen Huiliao spoke amid warm applause, first conveying the most cordial greetings of the Vietnamese people to the people of Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City. He said that Vietnam and China are two fraternal neighbors with a close relationship of interdependence, which has become increasingly close since the working classes of our two countries stepped onto the political stage. Since the founding of the political parties of the working classes of our two countries—the Communist Party of China and the Indochinese Communist Party—and their leadership of the revolution, the people of our two countries, educated in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, have stood side by side against imperialism. At present, we are advancing hand in hand in the struggle to build socialism, oppose American imperialism, liberate our entire territory, and defend peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

Then, he described how the people of China and Vietnam have historically influenced and supported each other in the struggle against common enemies. He pointed out that after the founding of the Indochinese Communist Party, the ties between the Vietnamese working-class party and the fraternal Communist Party of China became even closer. Commander Chen Huiliao said that during the Second World War, the heroic Chinese Red Army's resistance to Japanese fascism greatly inspired the Vietnamese revolution. He said that the victory of the Chinese revolution in 1949 opened up a vast rear area for Vietnam, linking Vietnam with the entire socialist camp. In early 1950, the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and other fraternal countries recognized the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which further strengthened our confidence in winning the final victory. He then spoke of the great help Vietnam had received from socialist countries in its construction and struggle, especially from the Soviet Union and China. He said that we will never forget the important assistance China has given to Vietnam in industry, agriculture, transportation, culture, and education. The Chinese people have also sent many outstanding experts to Vietnam to help Vietnam train many technical cadres and skilled workers. Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City have also helped Vietnam train hundreds of technically skilled cadres and workers, for which he expressed his heartfelt gratitude on behalf of the Vietnamese people. He also said that the Vietnamese people are overjoyed by the great achievements the Chinese people have made in building socialism. His speech was repeatedly interrupted by warm applause.

After Commander Chen Huiliao's speech, he presented a photo of Chairman Mao Zedong and President Ho Chi Minh together, as well as a banner, to the meeting. At this time, the entire audience stood up and thunderous applause resounded. After the meeting, a literary and artistic performance was held.

The delegation of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association arrived in Nanjing on the 4th. That evening, the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee held a banquet to welcome the distinguished guests.

    南京盛大集会庆祝越南国庆佳节
    许家屯、陈辉燎讲话盛赞两国人民日益发展的友谊
    新华社南京5日电　江苏省暨南京市各界人民一千多人今天下午举行盛大集会，热烈庆祝越南民主共和国成立十五周年。
    出席庆祝大会的有中共江苏省委书记处书记、江苏省副省长许家屯，中共江苏省委候补书记彭冲，江苏省副省长管文蔚、周一峰，中共南京市委书记、南京市长陈扬，中共南京市委书记刘中，南京市副市长王昭铨以及省市各人民团体负责人等。
    以陈辉燎为首的越中友好协会代表团全体贵宾出席了庆祝大会。在南京的越南实习生、留学生也出席了大会。
    许家屯在会上讲了话。他代表江苏省和南京市人民向英雄的越南人民热烈祝贺节日。他热情地赞扬了越南人民十五年来在越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席领导下各方面所取得的巨大成就，他指出，美帝国主义一贯地阻挠和破坏越南的统一、企图长期分裂越南，霸占越南南方，把越南南方变成殖民地和发动侵略战争的基地。他说，显而易见，美帝国主义是越南人民和全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。
    许家屯说：现在，我们兴奋地看到，越南人民的反美斗争，正在汹涌澎湃地向前发展，在越南南方，越来越多的人正挺胸而起，向美帝国主义及其走狗展开英勇的斗争。我们深信：曾经在震惊世界的“奠边府战役”中使帝国主义丧魂落魄的越南人民，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营以及一切爱好和平的人民和国家的支持下，一定能够以同样英勇顽强的斗争赶走美帝国主义侵略者，实现统一祖国的神圣愿望。许家屯还表示确信，中越两国人民在共同斗争中形成的战斗的友谊和团结，在马克思列宁主义的革命旗帜下，在建设社会主义的共同事业中，在反对帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策、维护亚洲和世界和平的斗争中，必将继续得到巩固和发展。
    陈辉燎团长在热烈的掌声中讲话，他首先向江苏省和南京市人民转达了越南人民最亲切的问候。他说，越南和中国是两个兄弟的邻邦，有着唇齿相依的密切关系，这种关系在我们两国的工人阶级登上政治舞台之后日益密切。自从我们两国工人阶级的政党——中国共产党和印度支那共产党成立并领导革命以后，我们两国人民在无产阶级国际主义精神教育下，又并肩反对帝国主义。目前在建设社会主义、反对美帝国主义、解放自己的全部领土、保卫东南亚和世界和平的斗争中又携手前进。
    接着，他叙述了在历史上中越两国人民在反对共同敌人的斗争中，一直互相影响、互相支持的情况。他指出，印度支那共产党成立后，越南工人阶级的政党和兄弟的中国共产党之间的联系就更加紧密。陈辉燎团长说，在第二次世界大战期间，反抗日本法西斯的英勇的中国红军对越南革命起了很大的鼓舞作用。他说，1949年中国革命的胜利，给越南开辟了广大的后方，使越南和整个社会主义阵营连系在一起。1950年初，中华人民共和国、苏联和其他兄弟国家承认了越南民主共和国，更加坚定了我们争取最后胜利的信心。他接着又谈到了越南在进行建设和斗争中得到了社会主义阵营各国给予的巨大帮助，特别是苏联和中国的帮助。他说，我们永远不会忘记中国在工农业、交通运输、文化教育等方面给予越南的重要帮助。中国人民还派出了许多优秀的专家到越南，帮助越南培养了许多技术干部和熟练工人。江苏省和南京市也帮助越南培养了成百的技术熟练的干部和工人，他代表越南人民表示衷心的感谢。他还说，越南人民对中国人民在建设社会主义事业中所取得的伟大成就感到欢欣鼓舞。他的讲话不断被热烈的掌声所打断。
    陈辉燎团长讲话结束后，将一幅毛泽东主席和胡志明主席合影的照片以及一面锦旗送给大会。这时全场起立，响起了春雷般的掌声。大会结束后举行了文艺演出。
    越中友好协会代表团是在4日到达南京的。当晚，江苏省人民委员会举行宴会欢迎贵宾。
