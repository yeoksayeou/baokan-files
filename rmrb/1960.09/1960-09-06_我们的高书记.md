The people of the commune, who were engaged in drought resistance and rush planting all over the mountains and fields, lit bonfires one after another; it was time for dinner. The fragrance of mountain flowers, mixed with the thin mist, rose from the valleys, and the firelight and moonlight were hazy in the mist. After dinner, I sat down to rest on a mountain rock. Directly opposite me was the figure of old Wang Zuolin. He let the evening wind blow open his white cloth jacket, revealing his hairy chest, facing me, smoking a cigarette, and talking to me incessantly:
    “Our place is a poor mountain valley, that's right. But relying on national relief every year, with our hands up, what kind of heroes are we?”
He imitated the speech of the commune's Secretary Gao. His flashing eyes and firm tone seemed to imitate Lao Gao as well. Then, he cocked his big beard and said with a chuckle:
    “Let me tell you a joke. Last year, on the twelfth day of the twelfth lunar month, it was so cold that even ghosts would grind their teeth. Before dark, I was bowing my head on the main road, picking up manure in my basket. What happened? A manure fork and a basket stretched out in front of my eyes too. I wasn't being polite; I grabbed it too. But what? I heard him say in my ear: 'Old man, you live closer to home, let me give you this basket of manure!' I went forward and took a closer look: 'Haha! It's you, Secretary Gao!' He spends his days carrying a manure basket in the fields, working alongside everyone. Eating at the edge of the field. Resting, he flops down on the embankment.
    “Last year in December, he led more than ten thousand of us, in twenty days, to build more than ten thousand pig farms. That night, it snowed heavily, and the northwest wind made the shacks tremble. At night, the snow fell even harder. Those who went outside the shed to relieve themselves came back and said that there was a light at the construction site. Four or five of us went to take a look, and it was him, Secretary Gao, building a pigsty; wearing a small cotton-padded jacket, a straw rope tied around his waist, covered in snow, his beard and eyebrows covered with frost. It was so cold that if you touched the stones, your hands would freeze to them, tearing off a layer of skin. What did he say? He didn't finish his quota during the day's meeting, so he was making it up at night. Good job, everyone braved the wind and snow, carrying lanterns and torches to work."
Beside the bonfire on the left, there was a loud voice amid the laughter, it was Secretary Gao. Old Wang Zuolin glanced over there with a smile:
    “I've never seen him worried. Last year, we had a spring drought that hadn't been seen in over thirty years. Some wells had even dried up. The ground was like the bottom of a hot pot. Some people said, 'It would be good enough if we could fill our stomachs with grain this year, how can we expect a bumper harvest?' Secretary Gao said at the commune's meeting of party members and cadres: 'It is indeed difficult to achieve a bumper harvest in such a drought. But we have more than two thousand party members and more than forty thousand commune members, there is no Flaming Mountain that we cannot cross!'"
A burst of singing came from afar, singing Leting shadow puppet opera in a high-pitched voice. The singing floated in this smoky blue moonlight. Old Wang Zuolin lowered his eyelids, smoking his cigarette, listening leisurely.
    “Ha! Our place, a place lacking all five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, suffered all five disasters last year! Yet, we still had a bumper harvest! You tell me.” Old Wang Zuolin seemed to suddenly remember, his voice raised twice as loud. “In the spring, Secretary Gao led us climbing mountains and crossing ridges, carrying water from rivers, pits, and wells, carrying it on our backs, using carts and donkeys to plant corn and sweet potatoes. Just as the sweet potatoes were taking off, we had a hailstorm. Secretary Gao led us to tidy up the damaged seedlings and re-fertilize. On July 20th, we had a storm with wind and rain that hadn't been seen in seventy years, and mountain floods broke out. At night, Secretary Gao came out in the wind and rain. Not caring about being washed away by the mountain floods, he climbed mountains and waded through water, went to the district brigade, and directed the old and young to go up the mountains. During the day, the rain stopped. When we looked, the embankments had been washed into piles of rubble, the crops were down, and the sweet potatoes had been washed out. Secretary Gao immediately held a meeting and said: 'Our crops have suffered, but our minds cannot suffer. We must not see the disaster in the disaster, and we must still overproduce by ten or twenty percent!'—You listen!”
Old Wang Zuolin leaned over, tugged at my coat sleeve, and lowered his voice:
    “That brigade leader who worked with us this afternoon, he pulled Secretary Gao across the river to see the crops. Secretary Gao said: 'Aren't you just asking me to see your disaster?' 'That's right!' 'Aren't you just trying to get me to report the disaster and not requisition grain?' 'That's right!' 'You're just waiting for relief with your hands up. If we save you, won't you still be poor? If you work hard, and have a bumper harvest, you will complete the state's requisition task, and still have a surplus. Is it better to be poor? Or is it better to be rich?' 'Of course, it's better to be rich.' 'Then let's work hard and have a bumper harvest! We would rather work hard than suffer!'
    “The entire commune was mobilized, digging the crops out of the mud, adding soil, cutting off the muddy hearts, and fertilizing. Secretary Gao's fingers were all swollen from digging. We sold more than 30 million catties to the state. We also kept more than 3 million catties of reserve grain for ourselves. You see!"
During this time, Secretary Gao stood up from the crowd beside the bonfire and spoke to someone who came to find him. Lao Gao was not tall, but he was sturdy and strong. He wore a blue cloth jacket and trousers. With his collar open. He always used his hand to stroke his broad chest when he spoke. A round, dark red face, always smiling eyes, coarse, stiff hair, slightly tilted to one side. But, that night, only his outline could be seen against the backdrop of the dark black mountain peaks; his entire figure, reflected by the light of the bonfire, shone with red.
    “Secretary Gao said that we must have perseverance!” Old Wang Zuolin said in a boastful tone. “He said, with perseverance, we will be more courageous and more motivated. He is strongly opposed to calculating small accounts. He said that calculating small accounts is working upwards, bargaining with superiors. Calculating big accounts is working downwards, resolutely implementing the resolutions of the superior party committee.”
The last two hours of labor of the day began. The sounds of laughter were mixed with the clanging of buckets, the sounds of windlasses, and the shouts of those driving pack animals… The surrounding crowds and the dark shadows of the mountains were made particularly black and particularly dense by the moonlight, and therefore particularly solemn. In the moonlight, on the line where the mountains and the sky met, Secretary Gao's tall figure was also integrated into the countless figures.

    我们的高书记
    管桦
    公社漫山遍野抗旱抢种的人们，燃起一处处鲜红的篝火，吃晚饭的时候了。山花的清香，夹杂在薄雾中，从山谷升起，火光和月色便朦胧在这薄雾里。饭后，我坐在一块山石上歇息。我的正对面，是老王作林的身形。让晚风吹开他的白布上衣，露出毛蓬蓬的胸膛，脸对着我，一边吸烟，嘴不停地跟我讲话：
      “我们这儿，是穷山沟，不错。可是年年手背朝下，要国家救济，这算什么英雄好汉？”
    他学着公社高书记的讲话。他闪射的目光，坚决的语气，似乎也在模仿老高。然后，翘起把大胡子，嘿嘿地笑着说：
      “告诉你个笑话，去年腊月十二，冷得鬼嗞牙。傍黑前，我在大道上低头往筐里捡粪。怎么啦？ 眼底下也伸过一把粪杈，一个筐。我可是不客气，他抢我也抢。可是，怎么着？听他在我耳边说：‘老大爷您离家近，这筐粪倒给您吧！’我上前仔细打量：‘哈哈！你呀，高书记！’他成天背个粪筐在地里转，同大伙一起干活。地头上吃饭。歇息了往坝坎子上一倒。
      “去年腊月，他带我们一万多人，二十天的工夫，盖了一万多间猪场。那天晚上，下大雪，西北风吹得窝棚直哆嗦。夜里，雪下得更紧了。到棚外小解的人回来说，工地有火亮。我们四五个人到跟前一瞧，是他，高书记垒猪圈呢；小棉袄，腰里扎根草绳，浑身落满雪，胡子和眉毛都结了冰霜。天冷的，一摸石头，就把手冻在上面，拉掉一层皮。他怎么说？白天开会，没完成自己的定额，夜里补上。好吗，这一下，人们都冒着风雪，灯笼火把地干起来了。”
    左面火堆旁边，说笑声中，有一个响亮的声音，正是高书记。老王作林微笑着朝那边瞥了一眼：
      “没看他发过愁。去年，三十多年没有过的春旱。有的井，水都干了。地就像烧热的锅底。有人说，‘今年粮食能够填饱肚子就不易呀，还能丰产？’高书记在全社党员干部大会上讲话说：‘这样的旱情，要能够丰收，确实有困难。可是，我们有两千多名党员，四万多名社员，就没有过不去的火焰山！’”
    远远传来一阵歌声，尖着嗓子唱乐亭皮影戏。歌声在这烟青色的月光中飘荡。老王作林垂下眼皮，吸着烟，悠然地听着。
      “哈！我们这儿，金木水火土五行俱缺之地，去年闹了个五灾俱全！还是大丰收！你说。”老王作林似乎是猛然想起，声音提高了两倍。“春天，高书记带领我们爬山越岭，从河里、坑里、井里担水、背水、车拉驴驮，种玉米，栽红薯。红薯刚甩腕儿，来了一场雹灾。高书记领我们整理受灾的小苗，重新追肥。7月20日又来了个七十年不遇的大风大雨，山洪暴发。夜里，高书记冒着风雨就出来了。顾不得遇到山洪会把他冲走，爬山涉水，到管区大队，指挥老幼上山。白天，雨停了。一看哪，坝坎子冲成乱石滩，庄稼倒了，红薯冲出来了。高书记立刻开会说：‘庄稼受了灾，我们的思想不能受灾。我们要受灾不见灾，还要超产一二成！’——你听！”
    老王作林探过身来，扯一下我的袄袖，压低声音说：
    “下午我们一块干活的那个大队长，他拉高书记过河去看庄稼。高书记说：‘你不就是叫我看看你们受灾的情况吗？’‘对呀！’‘你不就是想叫我给你们报灾，不征购吗？’‘对呀！’‘你这么手背朝下，等救济。救了你，不还是落个穷吗？要是苦干一场，来个大丰收，你完成国家的征购任务，还落个富余。是穷好？是富好？’‘当然富好。’‘那就苦干一下，来个大丰收！我们宁可苦干，决不苦熬！’
      “全社出动，从烂泥里把庄稼挖出来，培土、剪掉泥心子，追肥。高书记手指都挖肿。我们缴售给国家三千多万斤。自己还留了三百多万斤储备粮。你看！”
    这其间，高书记从火堆旁边的人群里站起来，同一个来找他的人说话。老高个子不高，结实、健壮。穿一身蓝布裤褂。敞着衣襟。说话老是用手抚摸自己宽阔的胸膛。圆圆的黑红的脸，永远微笑的眼睛，粗硬的头发，稍微翘楞往一边斜过去。但，这天晚上，却只能在淡黑色山峰的背景上看出他的轮廓；他整个的身形，映着篝火的光，闪耀着红色。
      “高书记说，要有恒劲！”老王作林用夸耀的口气说。“他说，有了恒劲，胆子就大，干劲就大。他顶反对算小账。他说算小账是往上做工作，向上级讨价还价。算大账是往下做工作，坚决执行上级党委的决议。”
    一天最后两个钟头的劳动开始了。说笑声中夹杂着水桶的叮当声，辘辘声，赶驮子的吆喝声……四周的人群、山岭的黑影，被月光衬托得分外显得黑，分外显得浓，因此分外显得庄严。月色中，山和天相接的棱线上，高书记的高大的身影，也溶合在无数的身影里了。
