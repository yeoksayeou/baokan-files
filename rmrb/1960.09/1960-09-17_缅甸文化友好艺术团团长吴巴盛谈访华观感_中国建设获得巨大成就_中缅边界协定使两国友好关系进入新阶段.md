Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, September 16th: U Ba Swe, the leader of the Myanmar Federal Cultural Friendship Art Troupe and Secretary of the Ministry of Culture, who recently returned from a visit to China, told Xinhua reporters here today that the People's Republic of China has made great achievements in all aspects since its founding. We saw brand-new factories, schools and workers' residences everywhere. The magnificent Great Hall of the People was built in ten months. This is a great achievement. He said that the Chinese people are working hard for the prosperity of their motherland. The Myanmar Federal Cultural Friendship Art Troupe visited the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for about forty days and returned here on the 14th.

U Ba Swe said: "The Chinese people cherish the friendship between the people of the two countries very much. The Myanmar Cultural Friendship Art Troupe was warmly welcomed and received by the Chinese people everywhere. The Chinese people greatly appreciate the pure national Myanmar songs and dances that are not affected by the unhealthy influence of Western culture."

U Ba Swe pointed out that the visit of the Myanmar Federal Cultural Friendship Art Troupe to China was a great success. This visit by the Myanmar Art Troupe will not only help promote cultural exchanges, but also further strengthen the friendship between the two peoples.

U Ba Swe said: "Since ancient times, China and Myanmar have been friendly neighbors. Chinese and Myanmar people are brothers and relatives. The Sino-Myanmar Border Agreement has brought the friendly relations between the two countries to a new stage."

U Ba Swe emphasized that the peaceful settlement of the Sino-Myanmar border issue powerfully proves to the world that although their social systems are different, as long as both sides adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, no matter how complicated the disputes are, they can be resolved satisfactorily through peaceful negotiations.

    吴巴盛强调说，中缅边界问题的和平解决有力地向全世界证明：尽管彼此的社会制度不同，只要双方恪守和平共处五项原则，无论怎样复杂的争端，都能够通过和平谈判求得圆满的解决。
