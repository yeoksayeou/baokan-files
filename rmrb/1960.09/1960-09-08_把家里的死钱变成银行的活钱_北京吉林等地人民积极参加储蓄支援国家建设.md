Xinhua News Agency, 7th: An atmosphere of valuing diligence and frugality is growing in the capital. The broad masses are depositing their savings in banks. As of early August, the total balance of urban savings deposits in the city reached 302.27 million yuan; compared with the end of last year, the number of depositors increased by 250,000, and deposits increased by more than 36 million yuan, of which fixed deposits accounted for more than 70%.

	Rapid growth in production and increased income for workers and residents are the main reasons for the rapid increase in urban savings. In particular, after the development of street industries, a large number of housewives have taken up production jobs and have income, and they are even more enthusiastic about participating in savings. The savings deposits of Xinjiekou People's Commune increased by 27,000 yuan in July, equivalent to more than half of the increase in deposits in the first half of the year. Xue Ronghua, a female worker at the Xinjiekou Electrical Switch Factory, has increased her income since participating in production, but she still carefully budgets. After receiving her salary every month, she only keeps some pocket money and deposits the rest in the bank. She also often promotes the principles of diligence and thrift to the people around her and organizes everyone to participate in savings.

	Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, bank employees and savings agents throughout the city have displayed a high degree of enthusiasm in their work. The red flag unit of the national banking system, Xidajie Savings Office in Xinjiekou, under the leadership of the commune's Party committee, organized service stations in the business district to handle savings. After starting this in July, the monthly savings amount reached more than two and a half times the average monthly savings amount in the first half of the year. The bank's savings procedures have also been reformed, and many operations have been mechanized, shortening the waiting time for depositors.
	
	Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 7th: The people in urban and rural areas of Jilin Province are carrying forward the fine tradition of hard struggle, managing their households diligently and frugally, and enthusiastically participating in savings. By August 20, the balance of urban and rural savings deposits in the province reached more than 170 million yuan, an increase of 95.4% over the same period last year.

	After the rural people's communes and the large-scale establishment of urban people's communes, the number of employed people has increased unprecedentedly, and a large number of housewives have been freed from tedious housework and have participated in social labor, which has promoted further development of production and also increased income. The people in urban and rural areas of the province, in the spirit of living a rich life as if it were a poor one, properly arrange their family lives and actively participate in savings. He Jiyuan, an old man in his sixties on Qiancheng Street, Hailong Town, Hailong County, deposited the money he had kept on hand for a long time in the bank. He said, "Keeping it at home is dead money, keeping it in the bank is active money. Turning dead money into active money is a better way to support national economic construction."

	The proportion of fixed deposits in many units is increasing. For example, the fixed deposits of members of the Xinchun Commune in Changchun have more than doubled compared with last year.

    把家里的死钱变成银行的活钱
    北京吉林等地人民积极参加储蓄支援国家建设
    据新华社7日讯　以勤俭为荣的社会风气正在首都日益增长。广大群众纷纷把节余下来的钱存入银行。截止8月上旬，全市城镇储蓄存款总余额已达三亿零二百二十七万元；同去年底比较，存款户增加了二十五万个，存款增加了三千六百多万元，其中定期存款占70％以上。
    生产大发展，职工、居民的收入增加，是城市储蓄额增长较快的主要原因。特别是街道工业发展以后，广大家庭妇女纷纷走上生产岗位，有了收入，更是踊跃参加储蓄。新街口人民公社7月份储蓄存款增加了二万七千元，相当于上半年存款增加数的一半以上。新街口电气开关厂的女工薛荣华，参加生产以后收入增加了，但是她仍然精打细算，每月发薪以后，除了购买必要的东西以外，手头只留下一些零用钱，其余都存入银行。她还经常向周围群众宣传勤俭持家的道理，组织大家参加储蓄。
    在各级党委的领导下，银行职工和遍布全市的储蓄代办人员，在工作中发挥了高度的积极性。全国银行系统的红旗单位——新街口西大街储蓄所，在公社党委的领导下，组织业务区内的服务站代办储蓄，7月份开始这样做以后，全月收储额达到上半年平均每月收储额的两倍半还多。银行办理储蓄的手续制度也进行了改革，不少操作实现了机械化，缩短了储户等候的时间。
    据新华社长春7日电　吉林省城乡人民发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，勤俭持家，踊跃储蓄。到8月20日，全省城乡储蓄存款余额达一亿七千多万元，比去年同期增加95.4％。
    农村人民公社化和城市大办人民公社以后，就业人员空前增加，大批家庭妇女摆脱繁琐的家务劳动，参加了社会劳动，促进了生产进一步发展，也增加了收入。全省城乡人民本着富日子当穷日子过的精神，妥善安排家庭生活，积极参加储蓄。海龙县海龙镇谦诚街六十多岁的何纪元老人，把长期留在手里的钱存到银行里。他说：“放在家里是死钱，放在银行是活钱，死钱变活钱，更好地支援国家经济建设。”
    许多单位的定期存款比重正在增加。如长春新春公社社员的定期存款比去年增加了一倍多。
