Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 5th: The delegations of the Red Cross Societies of Korea and Japan held the first formal negotiation in Niigata City today regarding the extension of the agreement on repatriating Korean residents in Japan.

The Japanese delegation admitted in today's talks that the need to repatriate Korean residents in Japan continues to exist as long as many people apply to return to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. From this point of view, the Japanese side stated that the term of the agreement on repatriating Korean residents should be extended.

Subsequently, the Japanese side put forward conditions for extending the term of the agreement and provided explanations.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 6th: In the second formal negotiation today regarding the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan, the delegation of the Korean Red Cross proposed an unconditional extension of the term of the existing repatriation agreement. The Korean side rejected the Japanese side's proposal in the first formal negotiation on the 5th regarding ending the repatriation work as soon as possible.

Lee Il-kyung, head of the Korean delegation, emphasized when making this proposal that the experience of repatriation work over the past year has proven that the current method of repatriation is reasonable and in line with the situation.

Lee Il-kyung pointed out that the Japanese proposal inappropriately emphasizes ending the repatriation work as soon as possible. He said, "This kind of thinking expressed in the Japanese proposal violates the spirit of the Red Cross and humanitarianism."

Lee Il-kyung also pointed out that the Japanese side originally agreed to unconditionally extend the term of the agreement, but now suddenly turned back and retreated to the current position because the Japanese government is engaging in political conspiracies, attempting to please the South Korean puppet clique.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 7th: The delegation of the Korean Red Cross refuted this morning in the third formal negotiation on the repatriation of Korean residents the unreasonable claim of the Japanese Red Cross to end the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan as early as possible.

Kazuyoshi Kasai, head of the Japanese delegation, attempted to defend their claim. He insisted that the recent repatriations were informal and temporary, and therefore, there is no need to continue them for a long time. Lee Il-kyung, head of the Korean Red Cross delegation, pointed out that the purpose of this Japanese claim is to prevent Korean residents from returning to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Lee Il-kyung also pointed out that Japan's request for Korean residents applying to return home to first register with the Japanese Red Cross is the first step in Japan's conspiracy to undermine the repatriation of Korean residents. He pointed out that if such a registration system is adopted, it will create artificial obstacles in the smooth repatriation process. The Japanese side is attempting to use this system to reduce the number of repatriated Korean residents. Lee Il-kyung pointed out: "This practice of the Japanese delegation is neither in line with the spirit of the Red Cross nor humanitarianism. The Japanese proposal is entirely out of political considerations, and it is merely a tool to disrupt the repatriation work."

The Japanese delegation made no statement at today's meeting. The fourth negotiation is scheduled for the 8th.

    朝日红十字会举行三次谈判
    日方企图阻挠朝侨归国
    据新华社5日讯　东京消息：朝鲜和日本的红十字会代表团今天在新澙市举行关于延长遣送旅日朝鲜侨民协定的第一次正式谈判。
    日本代表团在今天的会谈中承认，只要有许多人申请回到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，遣送旅日朝侨的必要性就继续存在。从这个观点出发，日本方面说，遣送朝侨协定的期限应当予以延长。
    接着，日本代表提出了关于延长协定期限的条件，并且作了说明。
    据新华社6日讯　东京消息：在今天关于遣送旅日朝鲜侨民的第二次正式谈判中，朝鲜红十字会代表团提议无条件延长现有遣侨协定的期限。朝鲜方面拒绝了日本方面在5日的第一次正式谈判中提出的关于早日结束遣侨工作的建议。
    朝鲜代表团团长李一卿在提出这个建议时强调说，一年来遣侨工作的经验证明，目前进行遣侨的方式是合理的和符合情况的。
    李一卿指出，日本的建议不适当地强调尽可能早日结束遣侨工作。他说：“日本的建议中所表现的这种想法是违反红十字会的精神和人道主义的。”
    李一卿还指出：日方原来赞成无条件延长协定期限，现在突然向后转，退到目前的立场，是由于日本政府正在搞政治阴谋，企图讨好南朝鲜傀儡集团。
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：朝鲜红十字会代表团今天上午在关于遣送朝侨的第三次正式谈判中驳斥了日本红十字会企图提早结束遣送旅日朝侨工作的无理主张。
    日本代表团负责人葛西嘉资企图为他们的主张辩护。他硬说，最近的遣送是非正式的和暂时的，因此，无需长期继续。朝鲜红十字会代表团团长李一卿指出：日本这个主张的目的在于阻止朝鲜侨民返回朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。
    李一卿还指出日本要求申请回国的朝侨首先向日本红十字会登记是日本阴谋破坏遣送朝侨工作的第一步。他指出，假如这样的登记制度被采用，它将在顺利遣送的过程中设下人为的障碍。日本方面企图利用这一制度来减少遣送朝侨的数目。李一卿指出：“日本代表团的这种作法，既不合乎红十字精神，也不合乎人道主义。日本的建议完全是出于政治考虑，它只是破坏遣送工作的工具而已。”
    日本代表团在今天的会上没有作任何声明。第四次谈判预定8日举行。
