　　Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, September 24th: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is concentrating leadership and labor forces to strengthen the front line of the autumn harvest. The autumn harvest and autumn plowing progress are both faster than in previous years, with the harvested area increasing by more than 70% compared to the same period last year.

　　This year, the area of autumn harvest crops in the Autonomous Region accounts for more than 80% of the total sown area for the year, an expansion of more than ten million mu compared to last year. While focusing on the intense autumn harvest, autumn plowing and autumn irrigation must also be carried out promptly. In order to seize the agricultural season and effectively handle the "Three Autumns" work in a timely manner, cadres from all levels of government, from the Autonomous Region to the communes, have been transferred to the countryside to participate in the autumn harvest. Ulanhu, First Secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, Secretaries Yang Zhilin and Wang Zaitian, Vice Chairmen of the Autonomous Region Gao Zengpei and Pengsuke, and others have all gone to the Haoqinyingzi Commune and Qiaobao Commune in Hohhot City, braving rain and wind to harvest millet alongside the farmers, greatly boosting the morale of cadres and members of all ethnic groups. In many banners, counties, and communes, more than 80% of the leading cadres and general cadres have gone to the front line of the autumn harvest.

　　In order to concentrate forces on grasping the autumn harvest, people's communes in various places have rationally arranged labor forces. The Hulunbuir League alone has added more than 5,800 people to the agricultural front line. Various parts of the Autonomous Region have also widely mobilized all sectors to support the autumn harvest. At present, the number of government cadres, factory workers, military officers and soldiers, school teachers and students, and urban residents participating in the autumn harvest throughout the region has reached more than 500,000. The Xilingol League has reclaimed more wasteland this year, with a large area of autumn fields. Some pastoral areas have also planted grain and feed. The Autonomous Region sent more than 10,000 people with tools to support them. Now, this league has harvested 92% of grain, feed, and other autumn field crops.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 22nd: Early autumn crops in various parts of Shanxi have gradually matured, and the autumn harvest work has generally unfolded from inside and outside Yanmen Pass to the south. The province has harvested more than 3.5 million mu of crops such as Chinese yam, naked oats, millet, broomcorn millet, beans, and millet.

　　People's communes in seventeen counties including Hequ, Zuoyun, Lingqiu, and Xinding in the Jinbei area have categorized and ranked various early autumn crops according to their maturity, meticulously formulated operating procedures from harvesting and transportation to threshing and storage, and accelerated the harvesting progress. Some people's communes in Shuoxian and Wuzhai, which have shorter frost-free periods, have harvested more than half. Yijing Commune divided the autumn harvest army into three teams: harvesting, transportation, and threshing, assigning tasks according to labor strength and cooperating with each other, harvesting more than 31,000 mu of crops such as naked oats, flax, and broad beans in seven days; more than 80% of the grain has been put into storage, achieving rapid harvesting and threshing, and careful harvesting and threshing.

　　Various places have actively taken measures to prevent wind and frost during the intense autumn harvest. Many communes and production teams have established meteorological organizations, designated special personnel to listen to weather forecasts, observe meteorological changes, set up fields, build mat sheds, and build simple underground cellars in the fields; during the harvesting process, they first rush to harvest millet and beans near mountains, ditches, and ditch heads that are vulnerable to natural disasters, and then harvest yam potatoes and more disaster-resistant corn. According to the experience of old farmers, the Maching Commune in Yangcheng County implements the methods of harvesting beans at 90% maturity, 100% maturity, and early morning and evening harvesting, which reduces the loss of pod shedding and threshing compared to harvesting at noon. When harvesting millet, broomcorn millet, yam potatoes, and other crops, they have all made timely rush harvests according to the changes in the climate, preventing losses such as grain drop or mildew due to late harvesting, rain, or mold.

　　Before the autumn harvest, various places made reasonable arrangements for harvesting and transportation tools, fields, and warehouses, so that during the autumn harvest, they could harvest, transport, thresh, and store as soon as they were ripe.

　　This newspaper, Guiyang, September 25th: Various parts of Guizhou Province are focusing on the quality of the autumn harvest, linking each link tightly from harvesting, threshing, transportation, and turning over to drying until storage, and striving to ensure that autumn grain returns to the granary.

　　Since September, middle rice and corn throughout the province have successively turned yellow and ripened, and members of all ethnic groups have happily started harvesting. In order to ensure that the grain is returned to their homes, various places have educated the vast number of members and cadres to cherish grain before harvesting. Many production teams have also mobilized the masses to contribute "grain loving plans" and formulated covenants and acceptance systems for careful and detailed harvesting. Some communes have also held small-scale on-site meetings and field exhibitions in areas where harvesting is earlier, and improved the understanding of cadres and the masses on careful and detailed harvesting by calculating the amount of grain thrown away. After the Wulan team of the Hongqi Commune in Sandu Shui Autonomous County carried out the "One Person, One Grain Loving Plan" activity, they put forward more than 80 opinions on eliminating grain spillage in two days.

　　In the autumn harvest, various places have also vigorously innovated harvesting techniques and tools, and adopted a series of careful and detailed harvesting methods in accordance with local conditions. When harvesting, members in various parts of Tongren County pay attention to moving the bottom without moving the top, and try to surround the thresher on three sides during threshing, and hitting slowly first and then quickly; the baskets are not filled too full during transportation; thin drying and frequent turning are done during drying, and the grain dried that day is cleaned up on the same day; slow fanning and even fanning are done when using the winnower, trying to fan twice, to avoid grain spillage losses.

　　In the careful and detailed autumn grain harvest, a large number of advanced people and units have emerged in various places. Under their leadership, the quality and efficiency of the autumn harvest have been continuously improved. The threshing team composed of Chen Mengyue and two other Dong women in Jinping County threshes more than 1,000 jin of grain per person per day, does not lose ears when harvesting, and does not leak grain when threshing, and has been established as a model threshing team by the Jinping County Committee of the Communist Party of China. More than 40,000 members throughout the county have invested in the competition to learn from and catch up with the Chen Mengyue model threshing team. In the past half month, 624 model teams and more than 4,000 model members have emerged.

　　This newspaper, Xining, September 25th: Spring wheat, highland barley and other spring-sown crops in the early-maturing areas of Qinghai Province have been mostly harvested, and various communes are concentrating manpower and animal power to strengthen threshing work. The counties of Jianzha and Minhe, which have faster threshing progress, have basically completed threshing and storage.

　　Qinghai Province has more rain in autumn, and some areas are prone to flash floods. Timely transportation and threshing can prevent losses such as grain germination and mold. This year, various places have changed the habit of "harvesting one autumn and threshing one winter" in previous years. Before harvesting, unified arrangements were made for the site, and fields were built at the ground to save labor; while harvesting, they were harvesting, transporting, and threshing at the same time. Communes in Tonghai District, Xining City, that have completed harvesting generally concentrate about 70% of their labor force to threshing. Cadres at all levels in the entire district also live in the fields and eat in the fields to strengthen leadership over threshing work. Each production team also organized a threshing leadership group with the Party branch as the core, established an acceptance system, and insisted on weighing as it was threshed and cleaning up on the day it was threshed.

　　This year, the planting area of ​​each commune and farm has been expanded to varying degrees compared with last year, the threshing task has increased, and seed fields and high-yield fields need to be threshed separately. In response to this situation, various places have come up with many new threshing methods. Many production teams have also made various hand-cranked and foot-operated threshers, so that threshing work has basically achieved semi-mechanization. Wangjiazhuang Production Team of Houzihe Commune in Chengxi District, Xining City, uses water power to drive threshers, winnowers, sieves, and ear grinding machines to achieve threshing linkage, so that wheat can be threshed and cleaned in one go, increasing work efficiency by 14 times compared with human and animal power threshing.

    据新华社呼和浩特24日电　内蒙古自治区集中领导力量、集中劳力加强秋收第一线。秋收、秋耕进度都比往年加快，已收面积比去年同期增加70％以上。
    今年自治区秋收作物面积占全年播种面积80％以上，比去年扩大一千多万亩。在紧张收秋的同时，秋翻、秋灌也要抓紧进行。为了抓紧农事季节，及时把三秋工作搞好，从自治区到公社的各级机关，都抽调干部下乡参加秋收。自治区党委第一书记乌兰夫，书记杨植霖、王再天，自治区副主席高增培、朋斯克等，都曾分别到呼和浩特市毫沁营子公社、巧报公社，冒雨顶风和农民一起抢收谷子，大大鼓舞了干部和各族社员的干劲。许多旗、县、公社已有80％以上的领导干部和一般干部到了秋收第一线。
    各地人民公社为集中力量抓好秋收，都合理安排了劳力。仅呼伦贝尔盟就给农业第一线增加了五千八百多人。自治区各地还广泛动员各行各业支援秋收。目前，全区各地参加秋收的机关干部、工厂职工、部队官兵、学校师生、城市居民已达五十多万人。锡林郭勒盟今年开荒多，秋田面积大，有些牧区还种了粮食和饲料。自治区便派一万多人携带工具去支援。现在这个盟已收割粮食、饲料等秋田作物达92％。
    据新华社太原22日电　山西各地早秋作物已陆续成熟，秋收工作已从雁门关内外向南普遍展开。全省已收割登场的山药、莜麦、糜、黍、豆类、谷子等作物达三百五十多万亩。
    晋北专区的河曲、左云、灵丘、忻定等十七个县的人民公社，按各种早秋作物的成熟情况分类排队，细致地制定了从收割、运输到打场入库的操作规程，加快了收割进度。无霜期较短的朔县、五寨等部分人民公社已收割一半以上。义井公社把秋收大军分为收割、运输、打场三支队伍，按劳力强弱分工协作，七天内收打莜麦、葫麻、蚕豆等作物三万一千多亩；80％以上的粮食已入库，做到快收快打、细收细打。
    各地在紧张的秋收中积极采取措施防风和防霜冻。许多公社和生产队建立了气象组织，确定专人收听气象预报，观察气象变化，在田间设场、搭席棚和搭简易地窖；在收割过程中先抢收靠山、沟边、沟头易受自然灾害的糜子、豆类，后收山药蛋和抗灾性较强的玉米。阳城县町店公社根据老农的经验，收豆子时实行九成熟、十成收和早晚收的办法，比在中午收摘要减少掉荚脱粒的损失。在收割谷子、黍子、山药蛋等作物时，根据气候的变化都作到了适时抢收，防止了因收获过晚，掉粒或阴雨霉烂等损失。
    各地在秋收前对收割、运输工具和场地、仓库等作了合理部署，使秋收时作到随熟、随收、随运、随打和随藏。
    本报贵阳25日电　贵州省各地狠抓秋收质量，从收割、脱粒、运输、翻晒直到入仓，环环扣紧，力争秋粮颗粒归仓。
    9月份以来，全省中稻、玉米相继黄熟，各族社员们喜气洋洋，开镰收割。为了使粮食颗粒还家，各地在收割前就教育广大社员和干部爱惜粮食，许多生产队还发动群众献
  “爱粮计”，制订精收细打公约和验收制度。有的公社还在收割较早的地区开小型现场会和田间展览会，通过算粮食抛撒账，提高干部和群众对于精收细打的认识。三都水族自治县红旗公社乌烂小队，开展“一人一条爱粮计”活动后，两天就提出八十多条消灭粮食抛撒的意见。
    各地在秋收中，还大力革新收获技术和工具，因地制宜地采取了一系列精收细打办法。铜仁县各地社员在收割时，都注意做到下动上不动，脱粒时尽量把挞斗围三面，打时先缓后急；运送时箩筐不装得太满；翻晒时薄晒勤翻，当天晒的谷子当天收干净；过风车时慢扇、扇匀，尽量扇两道，以避免谷粒抛撒损失。
    在精收细打秋粮中，各地涌现出大批先进人物和单位，在他们的带动下，秋收质量和工效不断提高。锦屏县陈孟月等三个侗族妇女组成的打谷组，每天每人打谷千斤以上，割不丢穗，打不漏粒，被中共锦屏县委树为标兵打谷组。全县四万多社员投入学、赶陈孟月标兵打谷组的竞赛运动，半月来已出现标兵小组六百二十四个、标兵社员四千多人。
    本报西宁25日电　青海省早熟地区的春小麦、青稞等春季播种作物绝大部分收割完毕，各公社正集中人力、畜力加强打碾工作。打碾进度较快的尖扎、民和等县，已经基本碾毕入仓。
    青海省秋季多雨，有些地区还容易发生山洪，及时拉运打碾可以预防粮食发芽、霉烂等损失。今年各地改变了往年“收一秋，碾一冬”的习惯，在收割前就对场地作了统一安排，并在地头建场节省劳力；在收割中边割边运边碾。西宁市通海区收割完毕的公社，一般都集中了70％左右的劳力碾场。全区各级干部也都住在场，吃在场，加强对打碾工作的领导。各生产队还以党支部为核心，组织了打碾领导小组，建立验收制度，坚持随打随过秤，当日打碾当日清。
    今年各公社和农场的种植面积比去年都有不同程度的扩大，打碾任务增加，种子田、丰产方都需要单独打碾。针对这种情况，各地想出了许多新的打碾方法。许多生产队还制作了各种手摇的、脚踏的脱粒机，使脱粒工作基本上实现了半机械化。西宁市城西区后子河公社王家庄生产队用水力带动脱粒机、风车、筛子、磨穗机，实现打碾联动化，使麦子由脱粒到扬净一气呵成，比人畜力碾场提高工效十四倍。
