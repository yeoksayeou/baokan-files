	Forward to the Front, Strive for a Bumper Harvest

	The Happiness Road People's Commune in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, led by Han En, resolutely implemented the Party's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, grain as the key link, and emphasizing both diversification and high yield. This year, they planted more than 14,000 mu of crops, with over 90% of the land planted with high-yield crops such as corn, rice, and soybeans. To achieve a bumper harvest, they organized several field campaigns for spring plowing, sowing, transplanting, summer hoeing, and weeding. All available manpower was concentrated on the front line of production.

	Now, the corn stalks, half a person tall, bear ears more than a foot long, and the rice, over two feet tall, is tasseling and flowering. Clusters of full bean pods hang from the branches. However, Han En was not deceived by this sight. This old hero, who has resolutely listened to the Party for sixteen years, still spends most of his time going deep into the production teams and the fields to lead production since becoming the Party Committee Secretary and Commune Director. He often said to the production team cadres: "Grain is the root of everything. The most important thing in leading production is to find every possible way to produce more grain." Therefore, his inspection of production was particularly careful and meticulous. Whenever he saw a plot of crops with many weeds, he could not help but frown, deeply feeling that the current leadership methods could no longer further adapt to the needs of the work. He resolutely responded to the Party's call to go deep into the front line of production, determined to return to the production team and, together with the cadres and commune members, practically fight this battle of later-stage field management to win more grain in the autumn.

	On August 3rd, Han En's request to return to the Baotun Production Team as Deputy Captain was approved by the Party Committee.

		"Lead the Charge," "Use Troops Skillfully"

	Over the past ten years, Han En has accumulated an experience: leading production requires leading by example. He often said: When serving as a grassroots cadre, you must be a "front-runner" in doing work and "lead the charge" when going into battle. This time, he was determined to adhere to the Party's "four togethers" instructions. The next day, he joined the commune members in the intense field labor. The commune members saw that although he had added a few more strands of gray hair in recent years, his energy was getting stronger and stronger, and his enthusiasm was getting even greater.

	In the midst of busy agricultural activities, he tightly grasped the main link of grain production. He found that some rice and corn fields had not been completely weeded, so he discussed with the captain: "Let's fight a 'war of annihilation' against them!" So, they concentrated 80% of the male and female labor force, divided them into two teams to attack the weeds. Each piece of land was inspected by a representative of the Party branch after it was hoed. If the ground was not clean, they would not stop hoeing.

	"Start of Autumn" had passed for several days, and the team still had more than twenty mu of cabbage that had not been planted; the planted vegetable fields were also in urgent need of weeding and ridging. At that time, there were only five people planting vegetables. Even if they turned over the wheat stubble, fertilized, and planted vegetables, it would take another six or seven days to finish. The climate in this area is cold, and frost comes early, and it was clear that the planting season was about to be missed. This was a major event related to the vegetables for all the commune members to eat in the coming winter and spring, and the commune members were very anxious.

	How to arrange the labor force to finish planting vegetables in time? Han En personally went to the vegetable field to discuss with the commune members who were planting vegetables. At first, someone said: "Let's divide some of the people who are weeding in the paddy fields and dry land over here. Anyway, the harvest of the autumn fields is set, so it doesn't matter if the weeding is delayed by two days!" He shook his head and said: "At this time, when the crops are filling their grains, we cannot say that the bumper harvest has been set. We cannot relax the weeding. Can everyone think of other ways?" A commune member said: "There are many people eating in our canteen and few people planting vegetables. What can we think of!" These words caused Han En to think deeply. He thought: If there are many people eating, there should be more people working! Where have all the people been arranged to go? He calculated with everyone and realized that this production team was close to the Baotun Management Area, and the carpenters, blacksmiths, cart transport team, vegetable production team, livestock breeding group, and their families directly under the management area were all eating in the production team's canteen, but did not participate in the production of this production team. After the problem was found, Han En asked everyone: "Can we 'borrow troops' to plant vegetables?" Zhang Weisheng, the Communist Party member leading the vegetable planting, thought for a moment and said: "They all go to work after eating breakfast, and some of the female laborers in the team do not participate in hoeing the ground before breakfast. If we mobilize them all to participate in planting vegetables and hoeing vegetable fields with us before breakfast every day, we can rush to finish it in two days. Those people in the management area do not belong to our team, and we can give them some work points as remuneration."

	In the evening, Han En and the production team leader invited the cart team leader, vegetable team leader, and the persons in charge of iron and woodworking and livestock breeding to discuss together. Everyone agreed to participate and did not want work points. Originally, they were also worried that if the autumn vegetables were not planted well, there would be a shortage of vegetables to eat next spring. Zhao Qin, the cart team leader, said: "Our canteen doesn't charge for vegetables anymore. Why do we need work points for planting vegetables for two mornings?"

	The next day, just as it was getting light, more than thirty people were temporarily assigned to the team to plant vegetables. More people meant more work, and they finished planting a large cabbage field in one morning. In two days and three mornings, not only were all the vegetable fields planted, but also the dozens of mu of cabbage, radishes, and scallions that had been planted before were hoed once.

	The commune members praised Han En for being resourceful and decisive. Han En said to the cadres: "To grow crops, first, you must calculate more and arrange things skillfully; second, you must discuss with everyone more and earnestly mobilize everyone to do it, and there will be no difficulties that cannot be overcome."

		More Concern, Careful Arrangement

	Leading the team not only requires worrying about production but also worrying about life. Han En has realized over the years that the busier the production and the greater the enthusiasm of the commune members, the more the cadres must care about the lives of the commune members.

	After several days of rain, Han En was worried about whether the commune members' houses would leak. Every time he came back from the flood prevention site, he didn't care about resting and went to the homes of various commune members to check their houses in the rain. He found that many houses were leaking, so he discussed with the cadres: Leaking houses affect the rest of the commune members. Now that production is very busy, the commune members are actively participating in collective labor and do not have time to repair their own houses, so the team should take care of this matter. Based on his suggestion, the team immediately organized a group to inspect all the commune members' houses, and all the leaks were repaired.

	Once, on the way to the paddy fields, a female commune member accidentally hit her toe on a small stone and cried out in pain. A young man next to her joked: "Good, barefoot saves shoes!" The female commune member was not in a good mood and muttered: "What's the use of saving shoes? The shoes are broken!" Han En was moved by what he heard. Then, while weeding, he intentionally brought the topic to shoes. Only then did he learn that many commune members' shoes were worn out. Han En thought that the weather was still warm and it didn't matter if they didn't wear shoes when working in the paddy fields; later, when the weather turned cold, they would need shoes for the autumn harvest and going up the mountains to engage in sideline occupations. If they didn't prepare their shoes now, wouldn't it affect the health and production of the commune members at that time!

	When he returned home, he found all the old shoes in his family from all corners. He thought, can't these shoes be patched up and soled and worn? He went to several commune members' homes to find out, and found that each family also had ten or eight pairs of old shoes, but because the female commune members were busy going to the fields for production, they did not have time to mend them.

	After clarifying the situation, he discussed solutions with the Party branch and the production team cadres. He proposed to mobilize the women to mend shoes. He said: In order to do this, we must first do a good job in educating them to build the country diligently and thriftily and manage the household diligently and thriftily. We must calculate the accounts with the commune members and figure out how much money each family can save by buying one less pair of shoes per person. It is recommended that the team take the initiative to arrange some shoe-mending time for the female commune members. The women's captain also suggested: The weather is getting cold soon, and the commune members also need to disassemble, wash, and sew cotton clothes and quilts, and this also needs to be given some time. The Party branch fully supported these opinions and entrusted this matter to the women's captains.

	A seemingly troublesome "housekeeping" matter was smoothly resolved after careful arrangement. The women's captains were very happy and felt that the Party branch and the production team attached so much importance to women's work that it would be easier to work in the future. The women were even happier, and they praised Han En as being "like a good housekeeper, so meticulous!" Han En said: "Everyone is the same. Production and life are connected, and action and thought are connected. When you are a cadre, you must manage both production and life, and you must not only solve difficulties but also get through your thoughts."

    老英雄回到第一线
    ——记全国农业劳动模范韩恩回生产队当副队长	刘群	  上前线　争丰收
    韩恩所领导的吉林蛟河县幸福之路人民公社，坚决执行了党的以农业为基础、以粮为纲、多种和高产并重的方针，今年多种了一万四千多亩作物，90％以上的土地种了玉米、水稻、大豆等高产作物。为了夺取丰收，他们组织了春耕、播种、插秧、夏锄、薅草等几次田间大会战。一切能够动员起来的人力，都集中使用到了生产第一线。
    如今，一人半高的玉米棵上结着一尺多长的玉米棒，二尺多高的稻禾正在吐穗扬花，成丛成簇的豆荚挂满了枝头。但是，韩恩并没有被眼前这片景象所迷惑。这个十六年来一贯坚决听党的话的老英雄，自从担任公社党委书记兼社长以来，仍然用大部分时间经常深入生产队、深入田间领导生产。他常常对生产队的干部说：“粮食是一切的根子，领导生产，最要紧的就是要想尽一切办法多打粮食。”因此，他对生产的检查，特别认真仔细。每逢看到一块杂草较多的庄稼，不由得蹙起眉头，深深感到目前的领导方法，已不能进一步适应工作需要了。他坚决响应党的深入生产第一线的号召，决心重回生产队去，同干部和社员们一起，踏踏实实地打好后期田间管理这一仗，争取秋季多打粮。
    8月3日，韩恩回保安屯生产队当副队长的请求，被党委会批准了。
          “挡头阵”“巧用兵”
    十多年来，韩恩积累了一条经验：领导生产需要带头生产。他常说：当基层干部，做活要当“打头的”，“上阵要挡头阵”。这次回来，他决心坚持党的“四同”的指示。第二天就同社员们一道投入了紧张的田间劳动。社员们看到他几年来虽然在鬓角上又添了几丝白发，但精力却越来越旺盛，干劲越来越大了。
    在繁忙的农事活动中，他紧紧抓住了粮食生产这个主要环节。他发现有些稻田和玉米田的草还没有除净，就同队长研究：“咱们也打它个‘歼灭战’！”于是集中了80％的男女劳动力，分成两个队突击灭草，每铲完一块地，就由党支部的代表验收一块，地不净，锄不停。
    “立秋”过去好几天了，队上还有二十多亩白菜没有种上；已经种上的菜地，也急需铲草和趟垅。当时种菜的只有五个人，连翻麦槎施肥带种菜，就是再有六、七天也种不完。这个地区气候冷，下霜早，眼看就要误过种菜的时机。这是一件关系到全体社员今冬、明春两季吃菜的大事，社员们心里都很焦急。
    怎样安排劳动力，及时种完菜呢？韩恩亲自到菜地去同种菜的社员商量。开头有人说：“把在水田和旱田灭草的人分一些过来吧，反正秋田的收成定了，灭草迟两天早两天没啥关系！”他摇了摇头说：“这个时候正在庄稼灌粒的节骨眼上，还不能说丰收已经定局，灭草是不能松手的。大家看能不能再想出别的办法呢？”一个社员说：“我们食堂里吃饭的人多，种菜的人少，哪有什么办法可想！”这句话引起韩恩的深思。他想：吃饭的人多，干活的人就应该多呀！人都安排到哪里去了呢？他同大家计算，原来这个生产队靠近保安管理区，管理区直属的木匠、铁匠、大车运输队、蔬菜生产队、畜牧饲养组和他们的家属，都在这个生产队的食堂吃饭，可是不参加这个生产队的生产。问题找到了以后，韩恩问大家：“咱们能不能来个‘借兵’种菜？”领导种菜的共产党员张维生想了一想说：“他们都是吃过早饭以后才上工做活，队上还有一部分女劳动力也不参加早饭前的铲地，如果把他们都发动起来，每天早饭前同我们一起参加种菜和铲菜地，有两天就可以突击完了。管理区的那些人，不属咱们队，可以给一些工分报酬。”
    晚上，韩恩和生产队长把大车队长、蔬菜队长、铁木业和牲畜饲养方面的负责人都请来共同商量。大伙都同意参加，而且不要工分。原来他们也耽心秋菜种不好，明年春天缺菜吃。大车队长赵勤说：“咱们食堂吃菜都不收钱了，我们种两早晨菜还要什么工分呢？”
    第二天，天刚发亮，就把三十多个人临时编在队里种菜。人多好干活，一个早晨，就种完了一大块白菜地。两天三早，不仅菜地全部种上了，而且把以前种上的几十亩白菜、萝卜、大葱锄了一遍。
    社员们称赞韩恩多谋善断。韩恩却对干部们说：“种庄稼一要多算计、巧安排；二要多同大家商量，认真发动大家来做，就没有克服不了的困难。”
          多关心　细安排
    领队当家，不仅要操生产方面的心，也要操生活方面的心。韩恩多年来体会到：生产越忙，社员干劲越大，当干部的就越要关心社员们的生活。
    连下几天雨，韩恩一心挂念着社员房子会不会漏雨？每次从防汛工地回来，顾不得休息，他就冒雨到各个社员家去查看房子。他发现有不少房子漏水，就同干部们商量：房子漏水，影响社员的休息。现在生产很忙，社员们积极参加集体劳动，没有时间修理自己的房子，队上应该把这件事管起来。队上根据他的建议，立即组织了一个小组，把社员的房子统统检查一遍，凡是漏的都设法修好。
    有一次，在去水田的路上，有个女社员没留神被小石头碰着脚指尖，疼得叫了一声。旁边一个小伙子同她开玩笑说：“好，赤脚片子省鞋呀！”女社员正没好气，便嘟哝了一句：“不省鞋有啥法？鞋子破了嘛！” 韩恩听了心里一动。接着，在薅草的时候，他有意把话题引到鞋子上来。这才了解到，有不少社员的鞋子都穿破了。韩恩一想，眼下天气还暖，又做水田活，不穿鞋倒不要紧；往后天气一凉，秋收和上山搞副业，都离不了鞋。如果现在不准备好鞋子，到那时不是会影响社员的健康和生产吗！
    回到家里，他就从各个角落里把全家的旧鞋都找了出来，他想，这些鞋补一补，打一打掌不是都可以穿吗？他又到几个社员家里去了解，果然发现各人家里也都有十双八双的旧鞋，可是因为女社员们都忙着下地生产，没有时间补。
    情况了解清楚以后，他就同党支部和生产队的干部们一起酝酿解决的办法。他提出要发动妇女们补鞋。他说：为了做到这一点，先要作好勤俭建国勤俭持家的教育工作，同社员算一算账，每人少买一双鞋，每家可以少花多少钱。建议队上主动给女社员们安排一点补鞋时间。妇女队长又提出：天快冷了，社员们也要拆洗缝补一下棉衣和被子，这也得给一点时间。党支部完全支持这些意见，就把这件事交给妇女队长们去办。
    一件看来很麻烦的“家务”事，经过细致的安排，就顺利地解决了。妇女队长们很高兴，觉得支部和生产队这样重视妇女工作，今后工作更好作了。妇女们更高兴，她们称赞韩恩“像个好管家婆，心可细咧！”韩恩却说：“人人都一样，生产和生活是连着的，行动和思想是连着的。当干部，就得既管生产也管生活，既要解决困难也要打通思想。”
