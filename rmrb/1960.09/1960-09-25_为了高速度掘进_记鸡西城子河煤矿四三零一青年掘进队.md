　　Striving for High-Speed Tunneling
　　——A Record of the 4301 Youth Tunneling Team of the Jixi Chengzihe Coal Mine
　　The 4301 Youth Tunneling Team of the No. 5 Well of the Chengzihe Coal Mine is a red banner in Jixi coal mining for high-speed tunneling. More than two months ago, they had already completed this year's national plan 195 days ahead of schedule.
　　In the Jixi Mining Bureau, people everywhere praise this team's communist style of learning from the advanced without complacency and helping the backward with all their efforts. Recently, the 4301 team's section chief, Guan Guangshun, captain Wang Senpei, and others went to the Hebi Coal Mine in Henan to learn from the Qi Hezhi Tunneling Team's high-speed tunneling experience.
　　　　Learning from the Advanced Without Complacency
　　The 4301 team's section and team leaders, Guan Guangshun and Wang Senpei, went to the Qi Hezhi team with the ambition of first learning a lot and then doing a lot. During the visit, they carefully scrutinized the Qi Hezhi team's drilling angle, position, and amount of explosives..., understood it clearly, greeted the host, and then started drilling on the spot, helping with blasting, loading, and timbering until they mastered the entire set of high-speed tunneling experience of the Qi Hezhi team before they would stop.
　　They scrutinized almost every tool on the Qi Hezhi team's working face, looking and looking, trying and trying, and even drawing sketches.
　　They returned to Jixi and, in just two days, popularized the drilling techniques they had learned.
　　The never complacent 4301 Youth Tunneling Team is constantly learning and advancing in this way. They learn the "five fasts" experience of the local Cui Guoshan Tunneling Team and the "deep-hole blasting" technology of Lu Jiake in Sichuan. In recent years, they have learned more than 20 experiences from brother tunneling teams in various places. They combined these learned experiences with the specific conditions of their own team and summarized twelve sets of rapid tunneling experiences such as "multi-process parallel and cross-operation." Therefore, since the 4301 team was established in 1955, it has successfully completed the national plan ahead of schedule for five consecutive years and has repeatedly won awards from the central, provincial, municipal, bureau, and mine levels, becoming an advanced unit attending the Second National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Congress.
　　　　Helping the Backward with All Their Efforts
　　Anyone who had been to the Chengzihe Mine before this year knows that the No. 5 Well is the smallest well in the entire mine, and the No. 6 Well is the largest well in the entire mine. However, after the 4301 Youth Tunneling Team was transferred to the No. 5 Well, the number of coal mining faces increased from the original two to five, and the output rose steadily, surpassing the No. 6 Well in absolute output. Of course, the No. 6 Well was not willing to lag behind. Therefore, since the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, these two mines, the smallest and largest in the entire mine, have launched a "pairing competition" day after day, ten-day period after ten-day period, and month after month.
　　It is natural for the two sides of the competition to care about each other's results. However, the workers of the No. 5 Well not only care about the output of the No. 6 Well but also care about the tunneling of the No. 6 Well, especially the tunneling level of the No. 6 Well's 4601 Tunneling Team. When they heard that the 4601 team's average daily progress in the second half of August was 70% higher than in the first half of the month, and that from September 1st to 12th, they had completed the tunneling workload equivalent to the entire month of July, they were as happy as if they had heard that the output of the No. 5 Well had exceeded that of the No. 6 Well.
　　It turns out that there is such a story of competition and collaboration between the No. 5 Well and the No. 6 Well, and between the 4301 team and the 4601 team.
　　In the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, the Chengzihe Mine Party Committee first focused on key points, requiring the largest mine in the entire mine—the No. 6 Well—to rapidly increase output. This required the No. 6 Well's 4601 Tunneling Team to ensure high coal production with high-speed tunneling, which was still somewhat difficult for the 4601 team at the time.
　　The young men of the No. 5 Well's 4301 Tunneling Team, upon hearing this news, began to discuss it enthusiastically at the pithead. Everyone unanimously expressed: "If the output of the No. 6 Well doesn't go up, the entire mine won't be able to surpass the other mines. While we are competing with the No. 6 Well, we must also organize forces to support the 4601 Tunneling Team."
　　The Mine Communist Youth League Committee and the No. 5 Well Communist Youth League Branch enthusiastically supported the 4301 team members' noble spirit of collaboration. Therefore, a support team composed of the 4301's captain, outstanding members, and worker technicians, a total of six people, went to the No. 6 Well and worked with the 4601 team members down the well, teaching them experience while working. At the same time, the 4301 team invited the 4601 team to send four team and team members to "study."
　　However, a problem was discovered at the closing meeting that day. The 4601 team members said: "Your 'multi-process parallel and cross-operation' experience is indeed much faster than us doing one process after another, but we just can't figure it out. Asking us to follow you is fine, but once you leave, we won't know how to do parallel and cross-operation!"
　　That night, Chen Jingxin and others returned to the 4301 team and discussed it with everyone. A comrade from the Municipal Communist Youth League Committee happened to be there, and he helped everyone come up with a plan:
　　"Isn't your 4301 team the best at being students? Seeking teachers and visiting sages everywhere to learn experience. Think about how people teach, and you'll be able to understand it the fastest?" This reminded the 4301 team members, and everyone chimed in, coming up with a set of "theory taught at pre-shift meetings, practice carried out underground, and experience found at closing meetings," and "the working face as a classroom, diagrams and charts as the battlefield," and "master watching the battle, apprentice wielding the knife," and other teaching methods that combined theory with practice.
　　The next day, at the pre-shift meeting, the 4301 team members, in connection with the actual situation of the working face, first explained and deployed how to apply the "parallel and cross-operation" experience during the shift, so that the 4601 team members understood the cycle mode, the connection of processes, and a series of technical operations before going down the well. Once underground, the 4301 veteran member Chen Jingxin used chalk to draw the drilling angle and position on the coal wall, explaining and demonstrating at the same time. After everyone understood, he asked the 4601 team members to drill, directing them from the side, so that they quickly mastered the drilling techniques. In the links where several processes such as drilling, loading, and timbering intersected, Yu Zhiyou and Zhu Lingling of the 4301 team specially taught the 4601 captain how to direct "parallel and cross-operation." At the closing meeting, the 4301 team members helped to summarize the operating experience of the shift. In this way, learning, practicing, summarizing, and improving at the same time, after more than ten days of collaborative support from the 4301 team, more than 90% of the 4601 team members learned the rapid tunneling experiences of the 4301 team, such as stepping-up drilling, multi-machine drilling, and multi-process parallel and cross-operation, which greatly improved the daily progress level. In the 14 days before the assistance, from August 1st to 14th, the 4601 team averaged 3.3 meters per day, and in the second half of August after the assistance, the average daily progress increased to 5.6 meters, with a maximum of 11 meters. Because the tunneling work gained the initiative, the raw coal output of the No. 6 Well also continued to rise.
　　　　Proposing Initiatives to Promote the Entire Mine
　　However, the 4301 team members were not satisfied with merely helping the 4601 team improve their tunneling level. Whenever they thought of the Mine Party Committee's call: "With coal, there is iron; with iron, there is steel; with steel, there is everything!" they always thought: Only by enabling more tunneling teams and groups to master rapid tunneling experience and leap forward at high speed shoulder to shoulder, can we increase the production of large amounts of raw coal and support steel production.
　　Everything for steel, everything for high-speed tunneling! Driven by this lofty aspiration, the 4301 Youth Tunneling Team proposed the initiative of "learning from the advanced, helping the backward, and leaping forward at high speed shoulder to shoulder" to the tunneling teams of the Jixi City Coal Mine.
　　Now, they regard their team as a school for imparting rapid tunneling experience. From the end of August to the beginning of September, they have held four sessions, each lasting four days, helping more than 50 section and team leaders from brother tunneling teams who came to "study" master the "parallel and cross-operation" experience.
　　The 4301 team's initiative has driven more and more tunneling teams in the entire mine to be involved in the communist collaboration activities of "learning from the advanced, helping the backward, and leaping forward at high speed shoulder to shoulder," and has further developed into mutual learning and mutual collaboration between tunneling and coal mining, and between coal mining and coal mining teams. Now, in the Chengzihe Mine, you can hear moving stories of the advanced helping the backward and the backward catching up with the advanced everywhere.
　　The advanced seed of the 4301 team has blossomed and borne fruit in the Chengzihe Coal Mine. The development of the "learning from the advanced, helping the backward, and leaping forward at high speed shoulder to shoulder" activities has enabled many tunneling teams in the entire mine to catch up with the advanced level. Among them, the average daily progress of seven youth tunneling teams has increased from the past average of 42.9 meters to 55.5 meters, exceeding the tunneling plan by 84% from September 1st to 4th. The coal output of the entire mine has also been continuously rising due to the leap forward in tunneling work. Among the three coal mines under the Jixi Mining Bureau, the Chengzihe Coal Mine originally ranked third in output, but now it has surpassed the other two large mines in absolute output and jumped to the first place in the entire bureau.

　　为了高速度掘进
　　——记鸡西城子河煤矿四三零一青年掘进队
    城子河煤矿五井4301青年掘进队是鸡西煤矿高速度掘进的一面红旗。早在两个多月前，他们就已经提前一百九十五天完成了今年国家计划。
    在鸡西矿务局，人们到处传颂着这个队学先进永不自满，帮后进全力以赴的共产主义风格。最近，4301队的段长关广顺、队长王森佩等又去过河南鹤壁煤矿学习齐合只掘进队的高速掘进经验。
            学先进永不自满
    4301队的段、队长关广顺、王森佩等是抱着先大学一番，再大干一场的雄心到齐合只队去取“经”的。在参观学习中，他们仔细瞅着齐合只队打眼的角度、位置、装多少药……，看明白了，向主人打个招呼，就实地打起眼来，打了眼又帮着放炮、装货、棚棚子，直到掌握了齐合只队高速掘进的全套经验，才肯罢休。
    齐合只队掌子面的每件工具，他们几乎都要仔细地盘问一番，看了又看，试了又试，还画了草图。
    他们回到了鸡西，只两天的时间，就把学来的打眼技术推广开了。
    永不自满的4301青年掘进队就是这样不断地学习着、前进着。他们近学本市崔国山掘进队“五快”经验，远学四川吕家科的“深孔爆破”技术，最近几年来，学习各地兄弟掘进队的经验达二十多项。他们把这些学得的经验结合本队具体情况，总结出了“多工序平行交叉作业”等十二套快速掘进经验。因此，4301队从1955年建队以来，连续五年都出色地提前完成国家计划，多次荣获中央、省、市、局、矿的奖励，成为出席第二届全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的先进单位。
          帮后进全力以赴
    凡是在今年以前到过城子河矿的人都知道，五井是全矿最小的井口，六井是全矿最大的井口。但从4301青年掘进队调到五井以后，使五井由原来二个采煤掌子增加到五个，产量节节上升，在产量绝对数上一跃而超过了六井。当然，六井也不甘居于下风。因此，从增产节约运动开展以来，这两个在全矿最小和最大的矿井之间，就天天、旬旬、月月地展开了你争我夺的“对口赛”。
    竞赛双方互相关心战果，原是很自然的事。但五井的工人不仅关心六井的产量，还关心六井的掘进，尤其关心六井4601掘进队掘进水平。而当他们听到4601队8月下半月比上半月平均日进提高70％，9月1日到12日又完成了相当于7月全月掘进工作量时，他们就像是听到五井产量又超过了六井同样地高兴。
    原来，在五井和六井，在4301队和4601队之间，还有这么一段又竞赛又协作的故事。
    在增产节约运动中，城子河矿党委首先抓重点，要全矿最大的矿井——六井迅速提高产量。这就要求六井的4601掘进队以高速掘进保证原煤高产，这在4601队，当时还有些困难。
    五井4301掘进队的小伙子们听到这个消息，就在井口热烈地议论开了。大家一致表示：“六井产量上不去，全矿就超过不了其他矿。我们一面和六井竞赛，还得组织力量去支援4601掘进队。”
    矿团委和五井团总支热情地支持4301队员这种高尚的协作精神。于是，一支由4301的队长、优秀队员、工人技术员共六人组成的支援队就到了六井，和4601队员一起下井边干边传授经验。同时，4301队又邀请4601队派了队长、队员四人来“留学”。
    但当天收工会上却发现了一个问题。4601队员说：“你们的‘多工序平行交叉作业’经验，确是比我们干完一道工序再干下一道工序快得多，可就是摸不到头。叫我们跟着干，行，但你们一走，我们就不知应该怎么平行交叉了！”
    当晚，陈景新等回到4301队就和大伙儿合计起来。正好团市委来了一位同志，他帮着大伙出计谋道：
  “你们4301队不是最善于当学生吗？到处求师访贤学经验。想想人家怎么教，你们最能领会的快？”这一说，提醒了4301队员，大家你一言，我一语，就凑出了一套“井前会议讲理论，井下操作去实践，收工会上找经验”，和“掌子面当课堂，图表下战场”、“师傅观阵、徒弟操刀”等理论联系实际的教学方法。
    第二天井前会时，4301队员就联系掌子面实际情况，先讲解和部署当班怎么运用“平行交叉作业”经验，使4601队员在没有下井以前就懂得了本班的循环方式，工序的衔接和一系列技术操作过程。到了井下，4301老队员陈景新就用粉笔把打眼的角度、位置都划到煤壁上，边讲边做。等大家都懂了，他就叫4601队员来打眼，他在旁边指挥，使他们很快就掌握了打眼技术。在打眼、装货、棚棚子等几个工序交叉的环节上，4301队于志友、朱令令等又特别教给4601队长如何指挥“平行交叉作业”。开收工会时，4301队员又帮着总结当班操作的经验。这样边学习、边实践、边总结、边提高，经过4301队十几天的协作支援，4601队90％以上的队员都学会了4301队的登?打眼、多机打眼、多工序平行交叉作业等快速掘进经验，使日进水平扶摇直上。在帮助前的8月1日到14日，4601队平均日进三点三米，帮助后的8月下半月，平均日进就提高到五点六米，最高达十一米。由于掘进工作争得了主动，六井原煤产量也不断上升。
                提倡议推动全矿
    但是，4301队员并不仅仅以帮助4601队提高了掘进水平为满足。每当他们想到矿党委的号召：“有煤才有铁、有铁才有钢、有钢才有一切！”他们总是想：只有使更多的掘进队、组都掌握了快速掘进经验，并肩高速跃进，才能增产大量原煤，支援钢铁生产。
    一切为了钢铁，一切为了高速掘进！就在这个崇高愿望的推动下，4301青年掘进队向鸡西市煤矿各掘进队提出了“学先进，帮后进，并肩高速跃进”的倡议。
    现在，他们把自己队当作传授快速掘进经验的学校，以四天为一期，从8月下旬到9月上旬已经开办了四期，帮助前来“留学”的兄弟掘进队的五十多名段、队长掌握了“平行交叉作业”经验。
    4301队的倡议，带动着全矿愈来愈多的掘进队纷纷卷入了“学先进，帮后进，并肩高速跃进”的共产主义协作活动，并进一步发展到掘进和采煤、采煤和采煤队之间的互相学习、互相协作。现在，在城子河矿，处处都可以听到先进帮后进、后进赶先进的动人事例。
    4301队这颗先进的种子，已经在城子河煤矿开花结果。“学先进，帮后进，并肩高速跃进”活动的开展，使全矿很多掘进队赶上了先进水平，其中七个青年掘进队由过去平均日进四十二点九米提高到日进五十五点五米，在9月1日到4日超过掘进计划84％。全矿煤炭产量也因为掘进工作的跃进而不断上升。在鸡西矿务局所属的三个煤矿中，城子河煤矿产量原来属于第三位，现在却已在绝对产量上超过了其他两个大矿而跃居全局第一位。
