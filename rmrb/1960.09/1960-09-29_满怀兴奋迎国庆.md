A Party Secretary's Notes

　　Greeting National Day with Excitement
　　Ye Yang, Secretary of the Party Branch of Shishui Brigade, Diancheng Commune, Dianbai County, Guangdong Province

    With incomparable excitement, we celebrate the eleventh anniversary of the birth of our beloved motherland. At this joyous moment, thoughts abound, and I am filled with emotion. The Party and the people have bestowed upon me too much honor. In reality, what I have done in the past is merely a tiny fraction of my duty, and it is no more than a Communist Party member should do.

    Someone asked me, why have I been able to persist in "four togethers" with the masses for ten years as if it were a single day? To answer this question, I must start with my own class origin. I am a peasant cadre from a hired worker background, and I will never forget the tragic circumstances of the past. Before liberation, my family "had no land to stand on," and we suffered the cruel exploitation of the landlord class. My father was brutally murdered by the reactionaries, and two of my younger sisters were forced into prostitution. Since childhood, I lived a life like a beast of burden, never having enough to eat or wear. My childhood was steeped in bitterness and tears! After liberation, I became a cadre, and under the cultivation and education of the Party and the influence of the hardworking and simple style of the veteran revolutionaries, my class consciousness has been further enhanced. Thinking about the suffering days of the past, looking at the happy life of today, and looking forward to the magnificent future, I am even more inspired with infinite love for the revolutionary cause. I often think to myself that I and the masses "were originally born from the same root," so how can I forget or leave them? This kind of class feeling makes me feel pain in my heart when I see the suffering of the masses, and I feel great happiness when I see the joy of the masses. Sharing weal and woe with the masses has become my firm belief in work and life. I eat, live, labor, and discuss matters with them, integrating myself into the masses.

    Is it necessary to be "four togethers" with the masses? It is very necessary. Chairman Mao requires us to share the destiny and breathe the same air as the masses. The ultimate goal of us Communist Party members in carrying out the revolution is to realize communism. Suffering before others and enjoying after them is the virtue of communists and a concrete manifestation of strong Party spirit. We understand that leaving the masses is like a drop of water leaving the vast ocean and drying up, and like a seed leaving the soil and unable to take root and grow. Without going deep into the masses, we will not know what they are thinking, and we will not be able to do things well and truly be diligent servants of the people. As the saying goes, "You don't know how warm the sun is until you bask in it, and you don't know how cold the snow is until you are in it," which is absolutely true. I remember in 1958, at the beginning of the Great Leap Forward, our brigade was filled with a leaping forward atmosphere. However, at that time, the Changpo production team was backward in everything and couldn't get anything done. At the time, I thought, water has its source and trees have their roots, and there is a reason for Changpo's backwardness. So I immediately rolled up my bedding and settled in the home of poor peasant Yang Guifang. During the day, I worked with her, and during rest periods, I helped her with housework. Once we became familiar, she told me her innermost thoughts. It turned out that some cadres in this team were busy with affairs all day long and did not participate in labor, only assigning production tasks downwards. The masses saw that the cadres were only using their mouths and not their hands, so their enthusiasm was naturally not high. After the Party branch solved these problems one by one, the enthusiasm of the masses rose, and they accumulated fertilizer and applied it, changed the backward rice paddies, and did everything well. As a result, the harvest became one of the production teams with the most increased production in the entire brigade. This fact is an effective sobering agent for those who say that "the 'four togethers' are outdated."

    Being "four togethers" with the masses is also an important measure to run the canteens well and care for the lives of the masses. This year, after the summer planting, the Party branch led the masses to do their best in field management, and they were indeed very busy. The cadres did not pay as much attention to the problem of vegetables in the canteen as they usually did. One day, I went to the Shishui canteen as a cook. It was strange, the rice was cooked, but I didn't see anyone picking vegetables. After asking the cook in detail, I learned that there were not enough vegetables. This made me remember that there had been too much rain a few days ago, and the vegetables were not growing well. Also, it coincided with the transition period between summer and autumn vegetables, and there was a fairly long period of vegetable shortage every year. Some people thought that this was a "small matter" and an old habit, and they didn't care. No, this is a major matter in the lives of the masses. How can they be enthusiastic if they don't eat well? We have to find a way to remedy it. After discussing with the commune members, we decided to manage the existing vegetables well and plant melons and autumn vegetables early to shorten the vegetable shortage period as much as possible. If this canteen is like this, aren't other canteens the same? At that time, I was very worried, and I immediately convened a Party branch meeting to grasp the solution of vegetables as an important issue. As a result, the entire brigade planted more than 10,000 melon plants, increased the planting of vegetables by more than 100 mu, and managed the original vegetable fields well. It seems that there are many such "small life matters"? If you don't go deep down for careful inspection, it is impossible to find them in time. Only by earnestly caring for the lives of the masses, letting the masses eat well and fully, can their enthusiasm be fully brought into play, and production will be better.

    Each stage of work has advanced, intermediate, and backward elements. Things are always developing in contradictions, from imbalance to balance, and from new imbalance to new balance. Under certain conditions, through subjective efforts, they transform each other, constantly developing towards a higher stage. And the places that are temporarily still relatively backward have more problems and greater difficulties, which requires more enthusiastic help and more in-depth and meticulous work. Therefore, since the establishment of agricultural cooperatives, our Party branch has had the atmosphere of competing to settle in backward areas to change the backwardness. Wherever the cadres went deep, the advanced factors there were brought into play, and after a period of effort, the work caught up. These facts show that as long as the cadres and the masses share weal and woe and are closely related, and the advanced factors in backward areas are brought into play, backwardness can be completely changed.

    Here, it has become a glorious style for cadres to take the lead in participating in production and leading production well. The Party General Branch has always grasped this point tightly. In addition to regularly carrying out recollections and comparisons to improve the awareness of cadres, it has also taken a series of effective measures: delegating a group of cadres to production teams, canteens, and work groups to strengthen leadership; each cadre stipulates labor tasks, work tasks, and study tasks within a certain period of time, everyone has labor tools and work point manuals, and they don't leave their hoes when they go out for meetings, and even move the meetings to the fields. This year, I, the brigade leader, and the commune members carried out rice mid-cultivation and fertilization together. As soon as I sprinkled a handful of fertilizer, several rice stem borers flew out. Taking a closer look, their bellies were full of egg sacs. How many white ears would hatch out! The brigade immediately carried out a comprehensive inspection and found that more than 800 mu were affected. So, they mobilized the masses to lure moths with lights for three consecutive nights and wiped them out, avoiding losses.

    Cadres and the masses eat together, live together, labor together, and discuss matters together, so that the cadres and the masses understand and care for each other, are closely connected, and the cadres and the masses are of one mind and twisted into one rope. Therefore, the entire brigade has achieved increased production year after year. Although the early rice suffered a strange disaster this year, the total output is still much higher than the same period last year, and this year's late rice has expanded by more than 1,000 mu. In order to continuously win three bumper harvests in this year's late rice, winter planting, and next year's early rice, all Party members and cadres of the Shishui Brigade resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, always go deep down, share the destiny and breathe the same air as the masses, further carry forward the fine style of "four togethers" with the masses, establish lofty ambitions, and strive to change the backwardness of "poverty and blankness."

　　满怀兴奋迎国庆
　　中共广东省电白县电城公社湿水大队支部书记　叶养
    怀着无比兴奋的心情，欢度我们可爱的母亲——祖国诞生的十一周年。在这欢乐的时刻，感想联翩，满怀激动，党和人民给我的荣誉太大了。其实，我过去所做的只是极其微小的份内工作，这也不过是一个共产党员所应尽的责任罢了。
    有人问我，为什么能够十年如一日坚持和群众“四同”呢？要回答这个问题，还得从自己的阶级出身谈起。我是一个雇工出身的农民干部，永远也不会忘掉过去的悲惨境遇。解放前，我的家庭“贫无立锥之地”，受尽地主阶级的残酷盘剥，父亲被反动派惨害，两个妹妹被迫出卖。我从小就过着吃不饱、穿不暖的牛马般的生活，童年浸透了多少辛酸血泪！解放后当上了干部，在党的培养教育和革命老同志艰苦朴素作风的影响下，阶级觉悟有了进一步的提高，想想过去苦难的日子，看看今天幸福的生活，憧憬未来瑰丽的前程，更加激发了对革命事业的无限热爱。我常常这样想，自己和群众“本是同根生”，怎能忘怀或离开他们呢？这种阶级感情使我看到群众疾苦就痛在心头，见到群众欢乐就感到莫大幸福。与群众同甘共苦成了我在工作和生活中的坚强信念。和他们同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，把自己融合在群众中。
    和群众“四同”有必要吗？很有必要。毛主席要求我们和群众共命运，同呼吸。我们共产党员干革命的最终目的是实现共产主义。吃苦在前，享福在后是共产党人的美德，也是党性坚强的具体表现。我们懂得，离开了群众，就像离开汪洋大海的一滴水珠会干涸，又像离开土壤的种子不能扎根生长。不深入群众，就不知道他们想的是什么，也就无法把事情办好，真正当好人民的勤务员。俗话说，“不晒太阳不知暖，不到雪地不知寒”，真是千真万确。记得在开始大跃进的1958年，我们大队到处都弥漫着一片跃进气氛。但是，当时长坡生产队落后禾多，样样搞不起来。当时我想，水有源头树有根，长坡落后有原因，于是立即卷起铺盖，到贫农杨桂芳家里落户，白天一起劳动，休息时间帮她料理家务，混熟了，她就把知心话告诉我。原来，这个队有一些干部终日忙于事务，不参加劳动，光把生产任务往下派，群众见干部动口不动手，积极性自然不高。党支部把这些问题逐个解决后，群众积极性高涨起来了，积肥施肥，改变落后禾，样样都做得好，收获结果成了全大队增产最多的小队之一。这个事实对那些“‘四同’过时”论者，是一服有效的清醒剂。
    和群众“四同”也是办好食堂，关心群众生活的重要措施。今年夏种后，党支部领导群众全力搞田间管理，确是忙得不可开交，干部没有平常那样注意食堂的吃菜问题。有一天，我到湿水食堂当炊事员，真奇怪，饭熟还不见摘菜回来，向炊事员细问，才知蔬菜不够供应。这一来，使我想起前些日子雨水过多，蔬菜生长不好，又碰上夏秋蔬菜交接期间，每年都有一段相当长的缺菜期，有些人认为这是“小事情”和老习惯，并不介意。不行，这是群众的生活大事，吃不好怎能发挥积极性呢？得想办法来补救。经过和社员商量，决定把原有的蔬菜管好，并提早种瓜类秋菜，尽量缩短缺菜期。这里食堂如此，其他食堂不也是一样吗？当时，心可急坏了，马上召开党支部会议把解决蔬菜作为一个重要问题来抓。结果，全大队种下瓜类一万多株，增种蔬菜百多亩，并管好原有菜地。看来，像这样的“生活小事”不是多得很吗？如果不深入下去细致检查，是不可能及时发现的。只有认真地关心群众生活，让群众吃好吃饱，积极性才能充分发挥起来，生产才会搞得更好。
    每一个阶段的工作都有先进、中间和后进，事物总是在矛盾中发展着，从不平衡到平衡，又从新的不平衡到新的平衡。它们在一定的条件下，经过主观努力互相转化着，不断地向着更高阶段发展。而暂时还比较后进的地方，问题较多，困难也会较大，这就更需要热情的帮助，进行更加深入细致的工作。因此，我们党支部从办农业合作社时起，就有着争相到后进地方安家落户改变落后的风气。干部深入到了哪里，哪里的先进因素就发挥起来，再经过一段时期的努力，工作就赶上去了。这些事实，说明了只要干部和群众患难与共，休戚相关，把落后地区的先进因素发挥起来，落后是完全可以改变的。
    在我们这里，干部以身作则参加生产，把生产领导好，已经成为一种光荣的风尚。党总支历来对这一条是抓得紧紧的，除了经常开展回忆对比提高干部觉悟外，还采取了一系列有效措施：下放一批干部到生产小队、食堂和作业小组去加强领导；每个干部在一定的时间规定劳动任务、工作任务和学习任务，人人备有劳动工具和工分手册，出门开会肩不离锄，连会议也搬到田头开。今年我和大队长以及社员一起进行水稻中耕施肥，刚撒下一把肥料就飞出几个螟蛾，细看一下，肚皮胀的一窝卵，孵出后得有多少白穗呀！大队立即全面检查，发现受害的有八百多亩，于是，发动群众一连三个晚上点灯诱蛾，扑灭干净，免除了损失。
    干部和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，使干部和群众之间互相了解，互相体贴，亲密无间，干部和群众一条心，拧成一股劲。因此，全大队连年都获得了增产，今年早稻虽然遭受了奇灾袭击，总产量仍然比去年同期增加很多，今年晚稻又扩大了一千多亩。为了连续夺取今年晚造、冬种和明年早造三个大丰收，湿水大队全体党员干部坚决遵从毛主席的指示，永远深入下去，和群众共命运同呼吸，进一步发扬和群众“四同”的优良作风，树雄心，立大志，为改变“一穷二白”的落后面貌而奋斗。（附图片）
