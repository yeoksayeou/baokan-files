Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 24th: The United Nations General Assembly continued its general debate yesterday.

    Ghanaian President Nkrumah, speaking at the morning session, condemned colonialism and imperialism for their rule and plunder of the African continent. He said that for years, the African continent has been groaning under the shackles of colonialism and imperialism, under exploitation and degradation. Throughout the African continent, from north to south, from east to west, its sons live in slavery and humiliation, while Africa's exploiters and self-proclaimed guardians of its destiny ravage our land with unprecedented brutality. But those days are gone forever.
    Nkrumah pointed out that Africa is fighting for freedom, and it will surely gain freedom. This is a simple appeal, and at the same time, it is a warning to those who ignore this trend.
    Nkrumah then pointed out that in the modern twentieth century, some countries are still advocating colonialism and imperialism. He emphasized that as long as an inch of land in Africa remains under foreign rule, the world will not have peace.
    Nkrumah firmly condemned the imperialist conspiracy in the Congo, saying that the enemies of African independence and unity are still stubbornly pursuing a "divide and rule" policy in the Congo. Nkrumah believes that the actions of neocolonialists in the Congo are "giving independence to the African people with one hand while taking it away with the other."
    Nkrumah emphasized that the Congo is an independent sovereign state. Colonialists and imperialists should remember this fact, and remember it forever. He advocated that independent African countries should help the Congo. All financial and technical assistance to the Congo can only be realized with the consent of the legitimate government of the Congo. He condemned the activities of the colonialists, with the help of their puppets, to split the young Republic of the Congo. He said that the Congo, including Katanga and Kasai, is a single and indivisible country. He demanded that the United Nations "guarantee the territorial integrity of the Congo," reorganize "the entire structure of the United Nations forces in the Congo... so that it is entirely composed of forces from independent African countries currently serving in the Congo," and "adopt a clear and positive approach to support the legitimate government headed by President Kasavubu and Prime Minister Lumumba."
    Nkrumah demanded an end to the colonial war waged by France in Algeria. He pointed out that any solution to the Algerian problem cannot be separated from the fact that Algeria is for Africans. Colonialism and imperialism cannot change this basic geographical fact. He said, "Colonialism, imperialism, and racism are doomed to failure in Africa, and the sooner the colonial powers recognize this fact, the better it will be for them and for the whole world."
    Nkrumah firmly demanded an end to the arms race. He pointed out that African countries should do their best to free their continent from nuclear war. To this end, the Ghanaian government believes that no country with nuclear weapons should be allowed to establish military bases on the African continent, and no African country should participate in military alliances with any foreign country.
    Speaking of the Far East issue, he pointed out the need to hold general elections as soon as possible in both North and South Korea and North and South Vietnam to eliminate the continued division of these two countries.
    Nkrumah suggested that, given the increasing importance of the African continent in world affairs, a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council should be created for African countries.
    Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers and head of the Soviet delegation, Khrushchev, delivered a lengthy speech at the afternoon session of the General Assembly, addressing issues such as disarmament and the elimination of the colonial system. Khrushchev submitted a draft declaration on the elimination of the colonial system and a "basic draft treaty on complete and general disarmament" for discussion by the General Assembly.
    U.S. Representative Wadsworth spoke at the afternoon session. In order to conceal the fact that the United States is unwilling to disarm and unwilling to stop pursuing neocolonialist policies, he opposed discussing disarmament and the elimination of colonialism at the plenary session of the General Assembly. Wadsworth also attempted to shift the responsibility for the breakdown of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting onto the Soviet Union and falsely accused the Soviet Union of "Communist imperialism." Wadsworth also accused Khrushchev's speech of spreading a "spirit of discord and revenge" in the General Assembly.
    Belgian Foreign Minister Wigny requested to speak in defense of Belgium's armed aggression against the Congo. He proclaimed that the Congo's independence was "given" by Belgium and that Belgium has "always respected the independence of the Congo." As Wigny spoke, the representatives of Ghana, Guinea, and Ethiopia walked out of the meeting.
    The representatives of Turkey and Iran also spoke at yesterday's General Assembly session. The next session of the General Assembly will be held on the 26th.
    The General Committee of the General Assembly also continued its meeting on the 23rd to discuss the agenda of the current General Assembly session. The meeting decided to include on the agenda the Soviet Union's accusation of the United States' acts of aggression threatening world peace and Morocco's proposal on the Mauritania issue. Under the manipulation of the United States, the committee included the so-called "Hungarian question" on the agenda, despite the protests of socialist countries. The next meeting of the committee will be held on the 26th.

    恩克鲁玛在联合国大会上发言
　　谴责帝国主义在刚果的阴谋
    美国代表反对联大讨论裁军问题和消除殖民主义问题
    新华社24日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会昨天继续进行大会发言。
    加纳总统恩克鲁玛在上午会议上发言时谴责殖民主义和帝国主义对非洲大陆的统治和掠夺。他说，多少年来，非洲大陆一直是在殖民主义和帝国主义的枷锁之下呻吟，在剥削和退化之下呻吟。在整个非洲大陆，从北到南、从东到西，它的儿子在奴役和屈辱之下生活，而非洲的剥削者和自命的它的命运的监护人，却以前所未有的残暴蹂躏我们的土地。但是这种日子一去不复返了。
    恩克鲁玛指出，非洲正在为自由而奋斗，而且它一定会得到自由。这是一个简单的呼吁，同时，这也是对无视这种趋势的人的一个警号。
    恩克鲁玛接着指出，在现代的二十世纪中，某些国家仍在宣扬殖民主义和帝国主义。他强调，只要非洲有一寸土地仍旧处在外国统治之下，世界就不会得到安宁。
    恩克鲁玛坚决谴责帝国主义在刚果的阴谋，他说，非洲独立和统一的敌人依然在刚果顽固地执行
  “分而治之”的政策。恩克鲁玛认为新殖民主义者在刚果的行动“是用一只手把独立给予非洲人民同时又用另一只手夺走它们的独立”。
    恩克鲁玛强调说，刚果是独立的主权国家。殖民主义者和帝国主义者应当记住这个事实，并且永远记住这个事实。他主张应当由独立的非洲国家来帮助刚果。对刚果的一切财政和技术援助只能在刚果合法政府的同意下来实现。他谴责殖民主义者在他们的傀儡们帮助之下力图分裂年轻的刚果共和国的活动。他说，刚果，包括加丹加和开赛在内，是一个单一的不可分割的国家。他要求联合国“保证刚果的领土完整”，改组在刚果的“联合国部队的全部结构……使它完全由目前在刚果服役的非洲独立国家的部队组成”，并且“采取明确的积极方针来支持以卡萨武布为总统以及以卢蒙巴为总理的合法政府”。
    恩克鲁玛要求停止法国在阿尔及利亚所进行的殖民主义战争。他指出，解决阿尔及利亚问题的任何途径都不能离开这样一个事实：阿尔及利亚是非洲人的。殖民主义和帝国主义也不能改变这个基本的地理事实。他说，“殖民主义、帝国主义、种族主义在非洲是注定要失败的，殖民主义国家承认这个事实愈快，那末，这对它们和对全世界来说将愈好”。
    恩克鲁玛坚决要求结束军备竞赛，他指出，非洲国家应当尽力使自己的大陆摆脱核战争。为此，加纳政府认为，必须使任何一个拥有核武器的国家不能在非洲大陆建立军事基地，必须使任何一个非洲国家不能同任何一个外国一起参加军事联盟。
    在谈到远东问题时，他指出有必要及早在全朝鲜和全越南举行普选以消除这两个国家继续存在的分裂状态。
    恩克鲁玛建议，鉴于非洲大陆在世界事务中的重要性不断增加，应当在联合国安全理事会中为非洲国家设置一个常任席位。
    苏联部长会议主席、苏联代表团团长赫鲁晓夫在大会下午的会议上发表了长篇演说，谈到裁军问题和消除殖民主义制度等问题。赫鲁晓夫提出了一项关于消除殖民制度的宣言草案和一项“全面彻底裁军条约的基本条款”供大会讨论。
    美国代表华兹沃斯在下午会议上发言。为了掩盖美国不愿意裁军，不愿意停止推行新殖民主义政策的事实，他反对在联大全体会议上讨论裁军问题和消除殖民主义问题。华兹沃斯还力图把十国裁军委员会会议破裂的责任推到苏联身上，并且反诬苏联是“共产帝国主义”。华兹沃斯还诬蔑赫鲁晓夫的发言是在联大散布“不和和报复的精神”。
    比利时外交大臣维尼要求发言为比利时武装侵略刚果的罪行辩护。他宣扬说刚果的独立是比利时
  “给予”的，比利时“一直尊重刚果的独立”。在维尼发言时，加纳、几内亚和埃塞俄比亚的代表退出了会场。
    在昨天大会上发言的还有土耳其和伊朗的代表。大会下次会议将在26日举行。
    大会总务委员会23日也继续开会，讨论本届联大的议程问题。会议决定把苏联对美国的侵略行为威胁世界和平的控诉问题和摩洛哥提出的毛里塔尼亚问题等列入议程。委员会在美国的操纵下不顾社会主义国家的抗议把所谓“匈牙利问题”也列入议程。委员会下次会议将在26日举行。
