    Diversification of Animal-Drawn Trains
    Jiangling County, Hubei Province, has recently seen the emergence of a variety of animal-drawn trains. Among them are six-wheeled horse-drawn trains suitable for trunk line transport, four-wheeled animal-drawn trains suitable for mountainous and hilly terrain, and four-wheeled and six-wheeled animal-drawn cable car trains suitable for rural roads.
    These trains are formed by reforming and combining the past two-wheeled animal-powered vehicles. Their transportation capacity has increased three to four times compared to before the reform. These vehicles are not only high in capacity, saving manpower and animal power, but also flexible to tow, stable and safe, and do not discriminate against livestock; mules, horses, donkeys, and cattle can all be used.

    畜拉列车多样化
    湖北省江陵县最近出现了多种多样的畜拉列车。其中，有适合干线运输的六轮马拉列车，有适合山区丘陵行驶的四轮畜拉列车，还有适合乡村大道运输的四轮、六轮畜拉钢丝车列车等。
    这些列车是把过去的两轮畜力车加以改革后组合而成的。它们的运输能力较改革前提高了三倍到四倍以上。这些车辆不仅运量大，节省人力、畜力，而且拖带灵活，平稳安全，不择牲口，骡、马、驴、牛都能适用。
