Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 12th: In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, Shanghai's steel plants have launched a competition to learn from and catch up with the No. 1 cupola of the No. 2 Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, resulting in a rapid increase in steel production. The city's steel production in August was higher every ten days; early September saw a new increase compared to August.

The No. 1 cupola of the No. 2 Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 is a newly rising red banner among the country's large cupolas. Its main experience is "Politics to the Furnace Front," conscientiously implementing the Party's mass line and technical policies, thereby making the cupola high-yielding, high-quality, and long-lasting, melting more and better molten iron, and opening up a broad path for a substantial increase in converter steelmaking. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry both attach great importance to the achievements of the No. 1 furnace. Since early August, they have continuously held national and Shanghai experience exchange meetings, requiring all plants to immediately promote it. The Party committee secretaries of all steel plants personally took charge of this work, taking the lead and organizing cadres to plant "experimental plots" in front of the cupolas. The enthusiasm of the workers in the city is very high. In the past few weeks, people going to the No. 1 cupola of the No. 3 plant to learn political and ideological work experience and technical operating experience have been almost constant every day. As of early September, the melting rate of half of the city's cupolas had approached or reached the level of the No. 1 furnace of the No. 3 plant, and the melting rate of the other half of the cupolas had increased by more than three tons compared with the average level of the previous month.

Through learning and promoting the advanced thinking and advanced experience of the No. 1 cupola, the political consciousness of the steel enterprise workers in Shanghai has been further enhanced, and the spirit of communist collaboration has been greatly developed. Many workshops have seen a situation where cadres and masses are of one heart, all links cooperate greatly, and jointly struggle to increase steel production. The furnace front workers on the cupolas of the converter workshops of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 now take the initiative to unite the workers of various types of work such as furnace lining, steel pouring, charging, slag removal, and machine repair, and take the initiative to help the furnace rear workers remove garbage and clear material pits; the furnace rear workers also try their best to create favorable conditions for the furnace front. Workers in the material yard and charging workers often take the initiative to go to the cupola to ask the furnace front workers: Is the furnace getting enough material, is it good? If they find that the material in the furnace is not good, they immediately organize forces to rush the pig iron and transport raw materials. Once, the cupola workers of Group B of the first converter workshop encountered a rainstorm as soon as they took over the shift late at night, and the iron material could not be transported in. The workers of each work section braved the wind and rain to pick up pig iron and transport raw materials to the material yard. Chen Jinxiang and others from the steel pouring section preferred to be soaked rather than letting the lime be damaged, so they took off their raincoats and covered the lime. With the full collaboration and support of the entire workshop, the cupola was not only full and well-fed, but also ensured that the converter created a new workshop shift production record.

Now, the experience of learning from the No. 1 cupola has been extended to all open hearth and electric furnace steelmaking workshops in the city; and from the steelmaking workshops to rolling, brick making and other workshops. Inspired by the advanced experience of the No. 1 furnace, the staff of many offices and production auxiliary departments have further developed their revolutionary consciousness and moved to work in front of the furnaces, determined to better support the steel workers in increasing steel production.

### 上海各钢厂学习上钢三厂一号化铁炉的经验  加强思想工作  发扬协作精神  化铁炉熔化率普遍提高　全市钢产量一旬高过一旬

    上海各钢厂学习上钢三厂一号化铁炉的经验
    加强思想工作  发扬协作精神
    化铁炉熔化率普遍提高　全市钢产量一旬高过一旬
    据新华社上海12日电　上海市各钢铁厂在增产节约运动中，掀起了一个学习和追赶上钢三厂第二转炉车间一号化铁炉的竞赛热潮，使钢产量迅速上升。8月份全市的钢产量一旬高过一旬；9月初比8月份又有了新的增长。
    上钢三厂第二转炉车间一号化铁炉是全国大型化铁炉中新升起的一面红旗。它的主要经验是“政治上炉前”，认真贯彻党的群众路线和技术方针，从而使化铁炉高产、优质、长寿，熔化出更多、更好的铁水，为转炉炼钢大幅度增长打开了宽广的道路。中共上海市委和冶金工业部都十分重视一号炉的创造，8月上旬以来，连续召开了全国和上海的经验交流会议，要求各厂立即加以推广。全市各钢铁厂都是党委书记亲自挂帅来抓这项工作，纷纷带头和组织干部到化铁炉前种“试验田”。各厂职工学习热情很高，几个星期来，前往三厂一号化铁炉学习政治思想工作经验和技术操作经验的人，几乎天天不断。到9月上旬为止，全市已有一半化铁炉熔化率接近或达到三厂一号炉的水平，其余一半化铁炉的熔化率比上月平均水平提高三吨以上。
    通过学习和推广一号化铁炉的先进思想和先进经验，上海钢铁企业职工的政治觉悟进一步提高，共产主义协作精神大大发扬，许多车间出现了干群一条心、各个环节大协作、共同为增产钢而斗争的局面。上钢一厂各转炉车间化铁炉上的炉前工人，现在都主动团结炉衬、浇钢、上料、运渣、机修等各个工种的工人，主动帮助炉后工人出垃圾、清料坑；炉后工人也千方百计为炉前创造有利条件。料场和上料工人经常主动到化铁炉上去问炉前工人：炉子料吃得饱不饱，好不好？发现炉子里料不好，他们就立即组织力量抢运。有一次，第一转炉车间乙班化铁炉工人，深夜刚接班就遇到了狂风暴雨的袭击，铁料运不进来。各工段的工人就顶风冒雨到料场上去拣生铁，运原料。浇钢工段陈进祥等宁愿自己身上挨淋，将自己的雨衣脱下盖在石灰上面，保护了石灰。在全车间通力协作支援下，化铁炉不但吃饱吃好，而且保证转炉创造了车间班产新纪录。
    现在，学习一号化铁炉的经验，已经扩展到全市所有平炉、电炉炼钢车间；并从炼钢车间扩展到轧钢、制砖等车间。许多科室和生产辅助部门职工，也在一号炉先进经验的启发下，进一步发扬了革命自觉性，纷纷搬到炉前办公，决心更好地支援钢铁职工增产钢铁。（附图片）
