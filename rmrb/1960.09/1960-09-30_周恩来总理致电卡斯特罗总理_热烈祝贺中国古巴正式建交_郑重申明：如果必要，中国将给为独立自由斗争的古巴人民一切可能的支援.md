Xinhua News Agency, September 29th—Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China today sent a telegram to Premier Fidel Castro of the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Cuba, congratulating him on the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Cuba. The full text of the telegram is as follows:
His Excellency Dr. Fidel Castro, Premier of the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Cuba, Havana:

    On the occasion of the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and your country, I would like to extend my warm congratulations to Your Excellency the Premier, the Government of your country, and the people, on behalf of the Chinese Government and people and in my own name.

    The Chinese and Cuban peoples have long established a profound friendship. In the common struggle against U.S. imperialism, we have always supported and encouraged each another. The victory of the Chinese revolution and the victory of the Cuban revolution have broken through the artificial barriers that U.S. imperialism has long established between China and Cuba and between China and Latin American countries, bringing our relations into a new stage of development.

    The heroic struggle of the Cuban people under the leadership of Your Excellency the Premier for national independence and democratic freedom has greatly inspired the people of Latin America and the people of all countries in the world, and has severely struck at the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war.

    The unremitting struggle of the Cuban government and the Cuban people to defend and advance the revolution, and to oppose the subversion, sabotage, threats, intimidation, economic blockade and military intervention of U.S. imperialism, has won the deep sympathy and firm support of the broad masses of people all over the world. The Chinese people will never forget the support of the Cuban people, nor will they ever forget to support the struggle of the Cuban people with their own efforts. I solemnly declare to Your Excellency and the fraternal Cuban people that, if necessary, the Chinese government and the Chinese people will give the Cuban people, who are fighting for independence and freedom, all possible support.

    I firmly believe that the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cuba will strengthen the friendly cooperation between our two peoples and further develop the friendship between our two peoples. I wish the Cuban people new victories and achievements in the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression, in defense of world peace, in defense of national independence, and in the development of the national economy.

              Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China
                          September 29, 1960, Beijing
