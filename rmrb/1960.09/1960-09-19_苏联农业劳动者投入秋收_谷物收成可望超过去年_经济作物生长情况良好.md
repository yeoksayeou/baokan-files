Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 17th: Kirdaov, a member of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, told this reporter that the Soviet Union's grain harvest this year is expected to be greater than last year. Livestock production and technical crop harvests are also very good.

He said that as of September 10th, 80% of the country's grain fields had been harvested. The remaining 20% are mostly in Kazakhstan and Siberia, where the grain maturity period was slower this year, so the harvest period was delayed, and it is expected that all harvesting can be completed around September 20th.

Kirdaov pointed out that in order to ensure that grain is processed in a timely manner, the Soviet state has built granaries and grain dryers in eastern Russia and Kazakhstan on a large scale this year. The newly built granaries have a storage capacity of 1,376,000 tons; the newly built 6,829,000 grain dryers can process several thousand tons of grain per hour.

He also said that a bumper harvest is also expected in animal husbandry this year. As of September 1st, the country had purchased 4,442,000 tons of meat and 18,735,000 tons of milk.

He pointed out that the growth of technical crops is very good. A total of 28.4 million hectares of technical crops were planted across the country this year. As of September 10th, 15.5 million hectares had been harvested. In some areas of Kazakhstan, yields of 300 to 400 centners of maize per hectare can be achieved.

Kirdaov also said that the Soviet Union harvested a total of 45 million tons of sugar beets last year, and is expected to reach 60 million tons this year. The harvests of other crops such as cotton, hemp, and tea are also very good.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 17th: According to Soviet newspapers, Soviet agricultural workers are stepping up the harvesting of grain, cotton, and sugar beets. Many regions have completed their plans for selling grain to the state.

As of September 10th, the Soviet Union had completed grain harvesting on 86 million hectares of land, accounting for 80% of the total sown area. Grain harvesting in the western regions has basically ended. In Siberia and northern Kazakhstan, harvesting is continuing, and the state has transferred tens of thousands of tractor drivers, combine harvesters, and truck drivers from the western regions to help with the harvest, and has allocated new harvesting machines. Despite the poor weather in the spring this year, which had a greater impact on crop growth, there is still a good harvest this year in the North Caucasus, the Volga River Basin, northern Kazakhstan, and Siberia. At present, cotton is being harvested in various republics of Central Asia, and sugar beet harvesting is also being carried out extensively in various places.

While harvesting, agricultural workers in many regions are selling grain to the state. The Stavropol Territory, Rostov, Saratov, Penza, Kuibyshev, Ulyanovsk regions, and some autonomous republics of the Russian Federation have completed their sales plans. The Stanislav region of the Ukrainian Republic completed the task of selling grain to the state ahead of schedule on August 10th, completing 158% of the plan. The Azerbaijan Republic had completed the entire republic's sales plan on August 25th. As of August 28th, agricultural workers in Kazakhstan, the Soviet Union's largest granary, had sold 110 million poods of grain to the state, which is equal to the output of the year before the opening of the virgin land in Kazakhstan.

After completing the sales task, some regions in the Soviet Union have also proposed to strive to sell more grain to the state than planned. The Kuibyshev region has sold 42 million poods (each pood is equivalent to 32.76 catties) of grain to the state, and is currently striving to sell 5 million poods more than planned. Cherno-Velshi and two other districts in this region decided to sell twice as much grain to the state as originally planned. (Picture attached)

    苏联农业劳动者投入秋收
    谷物收成可望超过去年　经济作物生长情况良好
    新华社莫斯科17日电　苏联农业部部务委员基尔达莫夫对本社记者说，今年苏联的谷物收成可望比去年多。畜牧业生产和技术作物的收成也很好。
    他说，到9月10日为止，全国已有80％的谷田完成了收割工作。其余20％的谷田，大部分是在哈萨克和西伯利亚，那里由于今年谷物的成熟期较慢，因此收割期推迟了，预计9月20日左右全部可以收割完毕。
    基尔达莫夫指出，为了使粮食及时得到处理，今年苏维埃国家在俄罗斯联邦东部和哈萨克大建粮仓和粮食干燥器。新建粮仓的贮藏量达到一百三十七万六千吨；新建的六百八十二万九千个谷物干燥器一小时内总共可以加工几千吨粮食。
    他又说，在畜牧业方面今年也可望丰产。到9月1日为止，全国采购的肉类已达四百四十四万二千吨，牛奶达一千八百七十三万五千吨。
    他指出，技术作物的生长情况非常良好。今年全国共种植了二千八百四十万公顷技术作物。到9月10日为止，已收割了一千五百五十万公顷。在哈萨克的一些地区，每公顷可以收获三百到四百公担的玉蜀黍。
    基尔达莫夫还说，苏联去年共收获了四千五百万吨甜菜，今年可望达到六千万吨。其他如棉花、麻、茶叶的收获情况也很好。
    新华社莫斯科17日电　据苏联报刊报道：苏联农业劳动者正在加紧进行谷物、棉花和甜菜的收获工作。许多地区已完成了向国家交售谷物的计划。
    截至9月10日为止，苏联已在八千六百万公顷的土地上完成了谷物的收获工作，占整个播种面积的80％。西部地区的谷物收获工作已基本结束。在西伯利亚和哈萨克北部，收获工作正在继续进行中，国家从西部地区调去上万名拖拉机手、收割机手和汽车司机帮助收割，并且拨了新的收割机器。尽管今年春季气候不好，作物生长受到较大的影响，但在北高加索、伏尔加河流域、哈萨克北部、西伯利亚等地区，今年还是好收成。目前，中亚细亚各共和国正在收获棉花，各地的甜菜收获工作也正在广泛展开中。
    和收割同时，许多地区的农业劳动者正在向国家交售谷物。俄罗斯联邦的斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区和罗斯托夫、萨拉托夫、奔萨、古比雪夫、乌里扬诺夫斯克等州和一些自治共和国都完成了交售计划。乌克兰共和国斯坦尼斯拉夫州在8月10日提前完成了向国家交售谷物的任务，完成了计划的158％。阿塞拜疆共和国在8月25日已经完成了全共和国交售计划。截至8月28日为止，苏联最大谷仓哈萨克共和国的农业劳动者已向国家交售了一亿一千万普特的谷物，这等于哈萨克开荒前一年的产量。
    在完成了交售任务以后，苏联有些州还提出要争取超计划向国家交售更多的谷物的保证。古比雪夫州已经向国家交售四千二百万普特（每普特合三十二点七六市斤）谷物，目前正在争取超计划交售五百万普特。这个州的契尔诺——维尔希等三个区决定向国家交售比原计划多一倍的谷物。（附图片）
