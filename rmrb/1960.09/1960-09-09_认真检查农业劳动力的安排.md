Adding Elite Troops to the Agricultural Front Guarantees Good Production
    Conscientiously Check the Arrangement of the Agricultural Labor Force

In the movement of the entire party and all the people engaging in agriculture and large-scale food production, two decisive measures are being actively implemented across the country. One is that cadres go to the front line to participate in and lead production; the other is to concentrate the maximum number of laborers to strengthen the agricultural production front line. The primary task for leading cadres at all levels who go to the agricultural production front line should be to specifically help the people's communes and production teams solve various specific problems, to ensure that the main labor force is used for current agricultural production, especially autumn field management and autumn planting preparation.

Not long ago, the Xiangqian People's Commune Party Committee in Minhou County, Fujian Province, decided to use 80% of the labor force to rush harvest early rice and rush transplant late rice. The Party Committee formulated a plan and deployed it in a timely manner. However, Comrade Ma Fuxiang, Secretary of the Minhou County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, went to the Dongsheng, Fenghang, and Dayi production brigades of this commune and found that the labor force actually participating in the rush harvest and rush planting not only did not reach 80%, but was even half less than in the same period last year. Why didn't the Party Committee's plan work? The main reason is that some cadres of the commune and production team lacked a correct understanding of the policy of "taking agriculture as the foundation" and "taking grain as the key link", fearing that strengthening agricultural production would affect industrial production and sideline income; other cadres were not good at distinguishing priorities and did not concentrate the labor force that could be transferred and should be transferred to the agricultural production front line. Comrade Ma Fuxiang helped the Xiangqian Commune Party Committee conduct in-depth ideological education for all the cadres, using various specific examples to repeatedly explain the principle that only when agricultural production develops and grain production develops, can the commune's industry, sideline occupations, and capital construction truly develop. Everyone reached a consensus, and then took firm measures to concentrate the labor force: according to the needs of agricultural production, appropriately adjust some industries and sideline occupations; help various commune-run enterprises and professional teams rationally arrange the labor force, and transfer the labor force over-occupied by various industries. In this way, the labor force participating in the rush harvest and rush planting in the entire commune increased from more than 7,000 to more than 13,500, reaching 83% of the total labor force, and successfully completed the rush harvest and rush planting tasks.

The facts of the Xiangqian Commune show that concentrating more than 80% of the labor force on agricultural production is not an easy task. Because it involves complex relationships in many aspects; there are relationships between agriculture and county and commune industries, relationships between agriculture and forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, relationships between current production and capital construction, and relationships between agriculture and finance, trade, culture, and education. How should so many complex relationships be handled appropriately so that each can get its due? It should be made clear to the vast number of cadres that county and commune industries, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fishery, capital construction, finance, trade, culture, and education are all indispensable and have great prospects for development. However, compared with agricultural production, especially compared with the production of grain crops, these undertakings must ultimately revolve around the central link of grain production. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and grain is the foundation of the foundation. If we do not use the main force to develop agriculture, then these undertakings will become water without a source and trees without roots, and will certainly not develop continuously and comprehensively. There are many examples in various provinces and regions of comprehensively developing various undertakings with grain as the key link. Using these examples to educate cadres and the masses is very persuasive. In 1958, agricultural production in Wadian Commune, Yuanjiang County, Yunnan, did not develop much, and part of the food grain had to be supplied by the state; because the foundation was not solid, the development of commune-run industries, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations was greatly restricted. In 1959, the commune concentrated its superior forces to develop grain production, and grain output jumped by 43%, changing from a grain-deficient commune to a surplus-grain commune. Because agriculture developed rapidly, the amount of fine feed increased, and animal husbandry followed with leaps and bounds, with an increase in animal husbandry income of 200% over the year. As agriculture rapidly developed, the raw materials and funds of industry and sideline occupations became abundant. The income from industry and sideline occupations increased six-fold for the entire year. The average wage of the commune members thus increased. The comrades of Wadian Commune have since recognized a truth: "With grain, everything is much more proactive." This year, they continue to concentrate the main labor force on agricultural production, the planting of rice and the progress of mid-tillage are fast and the quality is good. Diversified operations continue to develop by leaps and bounds. By the end of June, the number of pigs in stock increased by 60% compared with the same period last year. The task of selling pigs in the first half of the year was overfulfilled by 72%. The net income from industry and sideline occupations increased by more than two times compared with the same period last year. The Party Committee of Xiaopingshan Commune in Yulin County, Guangxi, clearly placed agriculture in the primary position and appropriately arranged the labor force for agriculture, commune-run industry, and diversified operations. During the slack farming season, 1,934 people from the entire commune participated in industry and diversified operations, but only 459 people were left during the busy farming season, and the rest were transferred to the agricultural production front line. In this way, the labor force participating in agricultural production in the entire commune reached more than 70% during the slack farming season and increased to more than 85% during the busy farming season. Agricultural production has been done very well, and the output value of industry and diversified operations in the first half of the year also increased from more than 677,000 yuan in the same period last year to more than 2.7 million yuan. Communes like Wadian and Xiaopingshan can be found in many areas. Using local materials to educate local cadres and the masses will surely receive greater results.

Concentrating the labor force should focus on two aspects: one is to change the situation of decentralized use of the labor force, and the other is to overcome the phenomenon of wasted labor force. In many regions and units, these two situations are often mixed together, so they should be resolved together through the review and rectification of the distribution of labor force in various industries. All counties, communes, and production teams should arrange the labor force in various industries with agricultural production as the center. Rural capital construction, including water conservancy construction, must be subordinate to the needs of current agricultural production and carried out in batches and phases under the premise of ensuring current grain production. County and commune industries and diversified operations, except for a part that must maintain year-round production, should generally be combined with the agricultural production season, doing more during the slack farming season, doing less during the busy farming season, suspending operations during the busy farming season, farming during the busy farming season, and working during the slack farming season. In this way, the situation of decentralized use of the labor force can be changed, and a large number of laborers can be concentrated on the agricultural production front line. Saving labor is a serious task, and measures such as streamlining organizations, rectifying professional organizations, and implementing reasonable matching of strong and weak labor forces should be taken to allow the labor force over-occupied by various units to return to the agricultural production front line. There are also a large number of idle laborers in rural market towns, who should be organized and transported to agricultural production. The recent facts of labor rectification in various places have proved that no matter which region or commune, there are many laborers who can be transferred to agricultural production. The key lies in whether the leaders have the greatest determination and whether there are appropriate measures to solve this problem. After a serious rectification in Xiangyang County, Hubei, more than 9,000 people from ten communes returned to the production teams. They took the following measures: First, vigorously reduce the number of full-time staff in the commune who are divorced from agricultural production. Each management area of Huangji Commune only kept one clerk, and each production team only kept one accountant. Two hundred and forty-two young and middle-aged full-time telephone operators, correspondents, statisticians, and custodians completely returned to the production front line. Second, streamline enterprise organizations. Commune-run enterprises in Dongjin Commune originally occupied more than 1,800 laborers, and the phenomenon of wasted work was quite serious. A woodworking factory occupied 20 extra people. After this streamlining, the commune drew more than 350 people from its affiliated enterprises and put them into agricultural production. Third, rectify non-production organizations such as cultural troupes. Each commune drew a group of young and middle-aged people and returned them to the production teams. The measures taken by Xiangyang County to concentrate the labor force to strengthen the agricultural front line were warmly welcomed by the production teams.

In some areas, the early autumn harvest has already begun, and in most areas, autumn harvest crops have entered the middle and late stages of growth and urgently need to strengthen field management. No matter which region, it is necessary to immediately prepare for autumn plowing and autumn planting. The current is the decisive moment to strive for high yield and more harvest in autumn this year and lay a good foundation for the summer harvest next year. Agricultural labor is the most glorious labor of the whole people. Staff, Communist Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and advanced elements in rural areas, taking the lead, warmly responding to the call of the Party, exemplarily implementing the decisions of higher authorities, making great efforts in agricultural posts, and making greater contributions to increasing grain and various industrial raw materials!

    农业战线添精兵　搞好生产有保证
    认真检查农业劳动力的安排
    在全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的运动中，有两项具有决定意义的措施，正在全国各地积极实行。一是干部深入第一线，参加生产领导生产；一是集中最大数量的劳动力，加强农业生产第一线。各级领导干部深入农业生产第一线的首要任务，应该是具体帮助人民公社和生产队解决各项具体问题，保证把主要劳动力用于当前农业生产上，特别是秋田管理和秋种准备工作上。
    福建省闽侯县祥谦人民公社党委不久以前决定以80％的劳动力抢收早稻和抢栽晚稻。党委订了计划方案，也及时布置下去了。可是，中共闽侯县委书记马福祥同志深入到这个公社的东升、风港、大义等生产大队中，发现实际参加抢收抢种的劳动力不但没有达到80％，甚至比去年同期还少一半。为什么党委的方案行不通？主要是因为公社和生产队的部分干部对于“以农业为基础”和“以粮为纲”的方针缺乏正确的认识，害怕加强了农业生产，会影响了工业生产和副业收入；另有一些干部不善于分别轻重缓急，所以也没有把可能抽调、应该抽调的劳动力集中到农业生产第一线来。马福祥同志帮助祥谦公社党委向全社干部进行了深入的思想教育，运用各种具体事例，反复说明农业生产发展了、粮食生产发展了，公社的工业、副业和基本建设都才可能真正发展的道理。大家认识一致了，然后采取坚决措施集中劳动力：根据农业生产的需要，适当调整一部分工业和副业；帮助各个社营企业、专业队合理安排劳动力，把各行各业多占用的劳动力抽调出来。这样，全公社参加抢收抢种的劳动力由七千多人增加到一万三千五百多人，达到总劳动力的83％，胜利地完成了抢收抢种任务。
    祥谦公社的事实说明，把80％以上的劳动力集中到农业生产上，并不是一件轻而易举的事。因为它包含着多方面的复杂的关系；有农业和县、社工业的关系，有农业和林、牧、副、渔各业的关系，有当前生产和基本建设的关系，有农业和财贸、文教事业的关系，有农业生产第一线和“后勤”工作的关系。这么许多复杂的关系，怎样处理才是恰如其分，各得其所呢？应该向广大干部说清楚：县、社工业，林、牧、副、渔各业，基本建设，财贸、文教各业，都是必不可少的，都有远大发展前途。但是，跟农业生产比较起来，特别是跟粮食作物的生产比较起来，这些事业毕竟是要围绕着粮食生产这个中心环节来办的。农业是国民经济的基础，粮食是基础的基础，如果不以主要力量发展农业，那末，这些事业就会成为无源之水，无本之木，肯定不会持续地全面地发展起来。各个省区都有许多以粮为纲全面发展各种事业的例子，用这些例子向干部、群众进行教育，是很有说服力的。云南元江县洼垤公社1958年农业生产发展不大，部分口粮要靠国家供应；因为根子扎得不牢固，社办工业、畜牧业、副业的发展都受到很大的限制。1959年公社集中优势力量发展粮食生产，粮食产量跃增43％，由缺粮社变为余粮社。由于农业发展快了，精饲料增多了，畜牧业跟着飞跃发展起来，全年畜牧业收入增加了两倍；由于农业发展快了，工业和副业的原料和资金充裕了，全年工业和副业收入增加了六倍。全公社社员的平均工资因而增加了。洼垤公社的同志们从此认识了一条真理：“有了粮食，不论什么工作都主动得多了”。今年他们继续集中主要劳动力于农业生产，水稻栽插、中耕进度快，质量好；多种经营继续大步发展，到6月底生猪存栏数比去年同期增加了六成，上半年生猪交售任务超额完成72％，工业、副业净收入比去年同期增加两倍多。广西玉林县小平山公社党委十分明确地把农业摆在首要地位，适当地安排了农业和社办工业、多种经营的劳动力，农闲时全社参加工业和多种经营的人力有一千九百三十四人，农忙时只留下四百五十九人，其余的人调到农业生产第一线。这样，全公社参加农业生产的劳动力，农闲时达到70％以上，农忙时增加到85％以上。农业生产搞得很出色，上半年工业和多种经营的产值也由去年同期的六十七万七千多元增加到二百七十多万元。像洼垤和小平山这样的公社，在各个地区都能找到很多，用当地的材料教育当地的干部和群众，必然收到更大的效果。
    集中劳动力应该从两个方面着眼：一是改变劳动力分散使用的状况，一是克服浪费劳动力的现象。在许多地区和单位中，这两种情况往往混在一起，因此应当通过对各行各业劳动力分配的审查和整顿，一并加以解决。各县、公社、生产队都应该以农业生产为中心来安排各行各业的劳动力。包括水利建设在内的农村基本建设必须服从当前农业生产的需要，在保证当前粮食生产的前提下分期分批地进行。县社工业和多种经营，除了一部分必须维持常年生产的以外，一般都应该同农业生产季节相结合，农闲多办，农忙少办，大忙停办，农忙务农，农闲做工。这样就可以改变劳动力分散使用的状况，集中大批劳动力到农业生产第一线来。节约劳动力是一个严重的任务，应该采取精简机构、整顿专业组织、实行强弱劳动力合理搭配等措施，让各单位过多占用的劳动力回到农业生产第一线。农村集镇上也有大批闲散的劳动力，应当组织起来，输送到农业生产上去。最近各地整顿劳动力的事实证明，不管哪个地区、哪个公社，可以调到农业生产方面的劳动力都是很多的，关键在于领导者有无最大的决心，有无适当的措施解决这个问题。湖北襄阳县经过一次认真的整顿，十个公社有九千多人回到生产小队。他们采取了如下几项措施：一是大力减少公社内部脱离农业生产的专职工作人员。黄集公社各管理区只留一个文书，生产队只留一个会计员，二百四十二个青壮年专职电话员、通讯员、统计员、保管员完全回到生产第一线。二是精简企业机构。东津公社社营企业原来占用一千八百多个劳动力，窝工现象相当严重，一个木工厂就多占用了二十人。经过这次精简，这个公社从所属企业中抽出三百五十多人，投入了农业生产。三是整顿文工团等非生产组织，各公社都抽出一批青壮年，回到生产小队。襄阳县集中劳动力加强农业第一线的措施，受到生产小队的热烈欢迎。
    有些地区早秋收获已经开始，大部地区秋收作物进入了生长中期和后期，亟需加强田间管理。无论哪个地区，都要立即准备秋耕秋种。当前正是争取今年秋季高产多收和为明年夏季丰收打好基础的决定关头。农业劳动是全民的最光荣的劳动。农村中的工作人员、共产党员、青年团员和先进分子们，以身作则，热烈地响应党的号召，模范地执行上级的决定，在农业岗位上大显身手，为增产粮食和各种工业原料做出更大的贡献！
