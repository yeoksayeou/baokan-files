The Encounter of a Spy-Diplomat
　　Lu Fuwei
    Recently, the Cuban government cracked down on an American spy ring in Havana. Two of the spies were employees of the U.S. Embassy in Cuba: Marjorie Lennox, the secretary to U.S. Ambassador Bonsal, and Robert Nitter. Cuban authorities have seized various pieces of equipment they used for eavesdropping, which they installed to eavesdrop on conversations in the Xinhua News Agency's Havana branch office. The Cuban revolutionary government has now decided to expel them (see the People's Daily, September 18).
    People still remember when the U-2 spy plane was shot down by the Soviet Union, the U.S. government denied that its mission was to "study the weather"; so, this time, eavesdropping on Xinhua's conversations, wouldn't that be wanting to "exchange news" with China!? The U.S. government will give what explanation, has not yet been announced. This matter is also difficult, to deny it, afraid of falling into passivity, to admit it, it is really too embarrassing. Therefore, they have to grit their teeth, pretend to be deaf and mute, "let others scold as they please, I will still be a spy."
    According to the U.S. State Department's last admission, carrying out espionage activities is "certainly no secret." However, this is, after all, detrimental to Eisenhower's high-sounding "peace" and "coexistence." Therefore, if they can deny it, they always want to deny it. Some time ago, the Soviet Union arrested and expelled some American spies who "traveled" to the Soviet Union. The U.S. government again took out its gangster-like, slanderous, and blood-spitting skills. When U.S. State Department press officer White answered reporters' questions, he said: "The Soviet Union seems to be suffering from a hysterical fear. Hardly a day goes by without a traveler being caught and charged with all sorts of crimes. I classify it as propaganda – written in capital letters and with five exclamation marks after it" (U.S. News Agency, Washington, September 6). But denial was still unsuccessful, as both the person and the stolen goods were seized. In the American spy case cracked by Cuba, the protagonists are no longer small "pilots" or mere "travelers," but dignified "diplomats." Such scandals are not uncommon in the United States' dirty and smelly diplomatic history. Mr. White, please tell me, what category should this kind of thing be put into? And how many exclamation marks should be added? The Cuban government has slapped the U.S. government with a very loud slap in the face with iron facts!
    Diplomats represent their countries, and they are only carrying out orders. Although such activities are "very necessary" for the United States, it is really inconvenient to admit to when it is brought to the table. To the people of the world, it is another good lesson. It turns out that U.S. diplomats, who are full of talk about "aiding" underdeveloped countries and "non-interference in internal affairs," are just a group of hiding, colluding, pregnant with evil intentions, and lurking in dark corners! As Cuban Foreign Minister Roa said, "This kind of activity carried out by the American spy group is a repetition of the methods commonly used by the Nazi secret police." This further confirms that the Cuban revolutionary government's righteous and stern condemnation of the U.S. government's aggressive policy is very necessary and correct.
    U.S. imperialism is most afraid of the awakening of the world's people, and most afraid of the unity of the world's people. The victory of the Cuban revolution has turned Latin America, this "quiet backyard," into the front line of the anti-imperialist struggle. U.S. imperialism has been painstakingly trying to subvert and isolate Cuba, and it is particularly afraid of the friendship between the Cuban people and socialist countries. When the Cuban government decided to establish diplomatic relations with China, the American bourgeois press exclaimed that "a time bomb has exploded"! Eisenhower openly threatened the Cuban government, saying that "this is a very serious mistake." But whether it is intimidation or provocation, it is U.S. imperialism itself that is being isolated. At the end of its rope, it actually dispatched special agents – "a charming U.S. Embassy secretary" (according to the Associated Press), using various eavesdropping devices, wanting to scoop up some "benefits" from Xinhua's conversations. All of this shows how much imperialism hates, antagonizes, panics, and is powerless in the face of the great friendship between the Cuban people and the Chinese people!
    What did the American spies eavesdrop on? They heard that the Chinese people resolutely support the Cuban people's struggle against U.S. imperialism; they heard that the friendship between the Chinese and Cuban peoples is great and unbreakable.... As the Cuban newspaper Hoy said, "What Xinhua talks about is what will soon be published to the world." Just as the spies were helpless and disappointed, "misfortunes never come singly," and they were caught by the Cuban government along with the stolen goods, and the painted skin of the "diplomat" was also torn off. Now, the Cuban people, who have stood up, have the full strength and determination to safeguard their sovereignty and dignity. As a result, two spy-diplomats were forced to be expelled, and they scurried away with their briefcases and went back to their country to "report" to the spy boss.

    间谍兼外交官的遭遇
　　陆拂为
    最近，古巴政府在哈瓦那破获了一个美国间谍集团。其中两名间谍是美国驻古巴大使馆的职员：一名是美国大使邦沙尔的女秘书马乔里·伦诺克斯；另一名是罗伯特·尼特。古巴当局已经缴获了他们偷听谈话的各种设备，这些设备是他们为了窃听新华社哈瓦那分社办公室的谈话而装置的。现在，古巴革命政府决定将他们驱逐出境（见9月18日《人民日报》）。
    人们还记得：当“U—2”型间谍飞机被苏联击落时，美国政府曾抵赖说它的任务是“研究气象”；那么，这次偷听新华社的谈话，该不会是想和中国“交换新闻”吧！？美国政府又将作何解释，迄今未见宣布。此事也难，抵赖吧，怕陷于被动，承认吧，实在太难堪。于是，只好咬紧牙关，装聋作哑，“痛骂由人痛骂，间谍我自为之”了。
    根据美国国务院上次供认，进行间谍活动，“肯定不是什么秘密”。不过，这对于艾森豪威尔高唱“和平”和“共处”，毕竟有妨碍的。所以，能够抵赖总想抵赖。前些日子，苏联曾逮捕和驱逐了一些到苏联“旅行”的美国间谍。美国政府又拿出流氓的那套信口诬赖、血口喷人的看家本领。美国国务院新闻发布官怀特答复记者的责问时说：“苏联似乎患着一种歇斯底里的恐惧狂。几乎没有一天没有一个旅行者被逮住并被加上各种各样的罪名。我把它列在宣传一类——用大写字母写，并在后面加上五个惊叹号”（美国新闻处华盛顿9月6日电）。但是，抵赖犹未成功，人赃都被拿住。古巴破获的美国间谍案，主角已经不是小小“飞行员”或区区“旅行家”，而是堂而皇之的“外交官”。这种丑事，在美国那一部又脏又臭的外交史上，是并不罕见的。请问怀特先生，发生这种事情，该列入什么类？又该加几个惊叹号呢？古巴政府已用铁的事实，打了美国政府一记非常响亮的耳光！
    外交官是代表国家的，他们奉命办事而已。虽然，这类活动对美国“非常需要”，但这给人拿到桌面上来，实在不便认账。对全世界人民来说，无异又是上了一堂好课。原来，满嘴“援助”不发达国家，“不干涉内政”的美国外交官，不过是一群掩掩藏藏、勾勾搭搭，怀着鬼胎，躲在黑暗角落里的角色！正如古巴外长罗亚所说，“美国间谍集团干出的这种活动是重复纳粹的秘密警察所惯用的手法”。这就更加证实了古巴革命政府对美国政府的侵略政策提出的义正词严的谴责，是非常必要和正确的。
    美帝国主义最害怕世界人民的觉悟，最害怕世界人民的团结。古巴革命的胜利，使拉丁美洲这个“平静的后院”变成反帝斗争的前线。美帝国主义处心积虑地想颠覆、孤立古巴，它特别害怕古巴人民和社会主义国家的友谊。当古巴政府决定和中国建交时，美国资产阶级报刊惊呼“一颗定时炸弹爆炸了”！艾森豪威尔公然威胁古巴政府，说“这是一个非常严重的错误”。但是，威吓也罢，挑拨也罢，被孤立的不过是美帝国主义自己。黔驴技穷，居然派遣特务——“一位迷人的美国大使馆秘书”（美联社语），用各种偷听设备，想从新华社的谈话中捞些“油水”。凡此种种，都表明帝国主义在古巴人民和中国人民的伟大友谊面前，多么憎恨敌视、惊慌不安，而又无能为力！
    美国特务偷听到一些什么呢？他们听到：中国人民坚决支持古巴人民反对美帝国主义的斗争；他们听到：中古两国人民的友谊是伟大而牢不可破的……。正如古巴《今日报》所说：“新华社谈的话就是即将向全世界发表的事情”。特务们正无可奈何和大失所望之际，“祸不单行”，又被古巴政府连人带赃捉住，“外交官”的画皮也撕去了。现在，站起来了的古巴人民完全有力量并且有决心维护自己的主权和尊严。于是，两个间谍兼外交官被迫驱逐出境，灰溜溜地挟起皮包滚蛋，回国向间谍头子“述职”去了。
