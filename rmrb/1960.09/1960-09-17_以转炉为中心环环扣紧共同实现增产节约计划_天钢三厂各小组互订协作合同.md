Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 16th: The various production groups of the Tianjin Third Steel Plant, based on the characteristics of continuous steelmaking production, have signed cooperation contracts with each other to ensure better implementation of the production increase and economy plan.

In August, the Tianjin Third Steel Plant mobilized the masses to carefully summarize the production situation of the first seven months, formulated a production increase and economy plan for the remaining five months of this year, and implemented the plan and measures down to the workshops, groups, and furnace platforms. Because steelmaking production is highly continuous, the plant's Party committee believed that although the plans and measures had been implemented, it was still necessary to strengthen the close ties and mutual cooperation between workers in order to effectively complete and achieve them on a shift-by-shift, day-by-day, ten-day-by-ten-day, and month-by-month basis. Therefore, it further mobilized all the plant's employees, centering on the converter and focusing on the pig iron furnace, to carry out activities to sign cooperation contracts based on the production increase and economy targets and specific measures already formulated by each group, process, and section, and to institutionalize the cooperative relationship.

After the signing of the cooperation contracts, each group, process, and section clarified its close relationship with steelmaking, unified its goals, strengthened its sense of responsibility, and everyone's actions proceeded from improving the output and quality of steel, greatly promoting the communist style. After discussing with the pig iron furnace workers, the charging workers further clarified the importance of their work in ensuring steelmaking production, summarized the advanced operating methods of pure material selection, accurate charging, full loading, and uniform feeding, and included this experience as a guarantee condition in the cooperation contract signed with the pig iron furnace workers. In the cooperation contract signed between the pig iron furnace workers and the converter workers, it was stipulated that the pig iron furnace workers should promote advanced technologies and work systems such as three highs (high desulfurization rate, high melting rate, and high molten iron temperature) and four connections (connection between front and rear processes, connection between furnaces, connection with steelmaking furnaces, and connection with molten iron ladles) in maintaining the furnace body and improving the quality of molten iron. Before each furnace of molten iron is tapped, the molten iron sample should be sent to the converter workers to solicit their opinions, jointly study the composition of the molten iron, and determine the tapping time to ensure that the converter is fed fully and well. Since the pig iron furnace workers have implemented the cooperation contract, they have made excellent achievements: the average furnace life of pig iron furnaces in early September increased by fourteen furnaces compared with August; the desulfurization efficiency stabilized at about 65%; the melting rate since September increased by 30.4% compared with August; and the average temperature of molten iron remained at 1350 degrees.

On the basis of signing cooperation contracts, the whole plant, centered on cooperation, carried out enthusiastic competition, pairing competition, contract furnace competition, tackling key problem competition, and performance competition between people, between shifts, between furnaces, and between groups, chasing each other and striving to be the best. The plant's production continued to rise, with the average daily steel output in August increasing by 12.7% compared with July, and further increasing by 10.63% compared with August since September. The qualified rate of steel also increased from 97.13% in August to 98.32% in early September.

    以转炉为中心环环扣紧共同实现增产节约计划
    天钢三厂各小组互订协作合同
    据新华社天津16日电　天津第三钢厂各生产小组根据炼钢生产连续性强的特点，互相签订协作合同，保证更好地实现增产节约计划。
    天津第三钢厂在8月份就发动群众认真总结了前七个月的生产情况，制订出今年后五个月的增产节约计划，并且把计划和措施落实到车间、小组和炉台。由于炼钢生产连续性强，厂党委认为计划和措施虽然落实了，要切实地按班、按日、按旬、按月的完成和实现，还必须加强工人之间的紧密联系和互相协作。因此，又进一步发动全厂职工，以转炉为中心，以化铁炉为重点，根据各个小组、工序和工段已经制定的增产节约指标和具体措施，开展签订协作合同的活动，把协作关系制度化。
    签订协作合同以后，各个小组、工序、工段都明确了自己与炼钢的密切关系，目标一致，责任心加强，人人一举一动都从提高钢的产量和质量出发，共产主义风格大大发扬。进料工人经过同化铁炉工人一起讨论后，进一步明确了自己的工作对保证炼钢生产的重要意义，总结出选料纯、进料准、装料满、上料匀的先进操作法，并且把这一经验作为保证条件，列入和化铁炉工人签订的协作合同中。在化铁炉工人和转炉工人签订的协作合同中，规定化铁炉工人在维护炉体和提高铁水质量方面，推广三高（脱硫率高、熔化率高、铁水温度高）和四联系（前后工序联系、炉与炉联系、与炼钢炉联系、与铁水包联系）等先进的技术和工作制度，并且在每炉出铁水前，将铁水样子送到转炉前，征求转炉工人意见，共同研究铁水成分，确定出铁水的时间，保证转炉吃饱、吃好。化铁炉职工执行协作合同以来，已经作出了很好的成绩：化铁炉炉龄9月上旬平均比8月提高了十四炉；脱硫效率稳定在65％左右；熔化率9月份以来比8月份提高30.4％，铁水温度平均保持在一千三百五十度。
    在签订协作合同的基础上，全厂人与人、班与班、炉与炉、组与组之间以搞好协作为中心，开展了热火朝天的对手赛、对口赛、包炉赛、攻关赛、表演赛，你追我赶，力争上游。全厂生产不断上升，8月份钢的平均日产量比7月提高12.7％，9月以来又比8月提高10.63％，钢的合格率也由8月份的97.13％，提高到9月上旬的98.32％。
