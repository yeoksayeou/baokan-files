        Guizhou Southern Folk Songs
    Send a Big Fish for Chairman to Taste
    The commune has a big fish pond,
    The fish in the pond are all strong,
    Catch a big fish a Zhang long,
    Eight people carry it to the train,
    Where is the big fish being transported to?
    Respectfully invite Chairman Mao to taste it.
        Hearts Turned Towards the Communist Party
    A big tree grows from one root,
    All ethnic people are of one heart,
    Our hearts are turned towards the Communist Party,
    Socialism lasts for ten thousand years.
        Cattle Driving Tune
    In the past, sending fertilizer up the mountain slope,
    Shoulder carrying and back hauling, sweat became a river,
    Now sending fertilizer up the mountain slope,
    Driving the pack cattle and singing songs.

        黔南民歌
    送条大鱼主席尝
    社里有口大鱼塘，
    塘内鱼儿条条壮，
    捉条大鱼丈把长，
    八人抬到火车上，
    大鱼运到哪里去？
    敬请毛主席尝一尝。
        心心向着共产党
    大树发?一个根，
    各族人民一条心，
    心心向着共产党，
    社会主义万年春。
        赶牛调
    以往送肥上山坡，
    肩挑背驮汗成河，
    如今送肥上山坡，
    赶着驮牛唱着歌。
