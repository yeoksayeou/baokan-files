    Anhui Mobilizes Labor to Fight Autumn Drought
    Since August, Anhui has not had a thorough rain, and some water and dry land crops have suffered from varying degrees of drought, which has also affected the continued planting of late autumn crops.
    The hilly areas between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, which are more severely affected by drought, have concentrated more than 80% of their labor force in the fight against drought, rushing to plant and protect seedlings. Many areas have divided their labor force into two teams: one for rushing to plant and the other for protecting seedlings.
    More than 4.6 million people across the province are also combining drought resistance with field management to strengthen the management of autumn fields. Bengbu, Lu'an, and Anqing prefectures have combined drought resistance with the planting of more than 6.5 million mu of various late autumn crops.

    Shanxi Strives for Early Maturity and High Yield of Late Autumn Crops
    Shanxi Province has planted 2.7 million mu more of late autumn crops this year than last year. At present, late autumn crops are in the vigorous growth stage of flowering and heading. Further managing late autumn crops is one of the important keys to ensuring increased grain production this year. Jin Southeast Prefecture organized 400,000 professional field management personnel, and from the second half of August to now, they have weeded the 2.4 million mu of late autumn crops in the area once, of which 42% of the area has been weeded twice, and more than 1 million mu have also been top-dressed with fertilizer for the first time. In Jin South, Jin North, Jin Central and other three prefectures, the area of late autumn crops that had been weeded once by the end of August reached more than 80% of the total area.
    All localities are paying attention to the frost prevention work of late autumn crops.

    Jiangsu Strengthens Management of Late and Very Late Autumn Crops
    The vast number of cadres and members of the people's communes in rural Jiangsu Province are taking the same energy as they do in grasping major autumn crops to manage the various late and very late autumn crops that have been planted.
    Field management of late and very late autumn crops is a battle to seize grain against time. Generally speaking, the characteristics of late and very late autumn crops are that the growth period is relatively short and the seasonality is strong. Early development and early maturity can avoid frost damage and obtain high yields, and can also free up stubble early for wheat autumn sowing. According to this characteristic, all localities manage late and very late autumn crops with the spirit of managing them once planted and managing them to the end. All management measures focus on the word "early," striving for agricultural time and promoting early development and early maturity.

    Inner Mongolia Prepares Autumn Harvest Tools
    All parts of Inner Mongolia are actively preparing harvesting tools to welcome the autumn harvest. Zhalute Banner is organizing 1,400 skilled craftsmen to work day and night to manufacture harvesting machines for tall and short stalk crops, and threshing machines for corn and millet. In nearly 20 days, a total of 427 units have been manufactured. More than ten kinds of tools successfully trial-produced in Ningcheng County, such as sugar beet harvesters, universal threshers, and potato harvesters, have improved work efficiency by more than ten times, providing favorable conditions for accelerating the autumn harvest. In addition to preparing harvesting tools, Xilin Gol League has also repaired more than 16,000 threshing grounds and more than 2,000 potato cellars.

    Pando Township in Lhasa Creates New Records in Cattle and Sheep Breeding
    Pastoralists in Pando Township, Linzhou County, Lhasa City, Tibet, have broken the past habit of one calf every two years for cows and one lamb per year for sheep, and have created new achievements of one calf per year for cows and two litters per year, multiple lambs per litter, for ewes.
    This year, Pando Township has 355 cows producing one calf per year, and 216 ewes producing two litters per year, most of which have multiple lambs per litter.
    Because the pastoralists in this township have adopted "hot nest breeding" for female livestock and strengthened feeding management, the number of offspring produced by many female livestock has generally increased.

    要闻快报
    安徽调集劳力抗秋旱
    从8月以来，安徽各地没有下过透雨，已有部分水、旱作物受到了不同程度的干旱，继续播种晚秋作物也受到了影响。
    受旱较重的江淮之间的丘陵地带，集中了80％以上的劳力投入抗旱抢种和抗旱保苗斗争。许多地区将劳力分成抢种和保苗的两套班子。
    全省各地的四百六十多万名田间管理大军也都结合抗旱，加工管理秋田。蚌埠、六安、安庆三个专区结合抗旱，抢种各种晚秋作物六百五十多万亩。
    山西争取晚秋作物早熟多收
    山西省今年种的晚秋作物比去年增加了二百七十万亩。目前晚秋作物正处在扬花抽穗的生长盛期，进一步管好晚秋作物是保证今年粮食增产的重要关键之一。晋东南专区组织四十万专业田间管理队伍，从8月下半月到现在，给全区二百四十万亩晚秋作物锄了一遍，其中有42％的面积锄过两遍，有一百多万亩还追施过第一遍肥。晋南、晋北、晋中等三个专区的晚秋作物，到8月底为止，锄过一遍的面积达到总面积的80％以上。
    各地都注意晚秋作物的防霜冻工作。
    江苏各地加强晚晚秋作物管理
    江苏省农村各人民公社的广大干部和社员，拿出抓大秋作物一样的劲头，扎扎实实地管理已种下去的各种晚晚秋作物。
    晚晚秋作物田间管理工作，是与时间争粮食的一场战斗。一般晚晚秋作物的特点，生长期都比较短，季节性强，早发育早熟可以避免晚霜为害，获得高产多收，又可为麦子秋播及早腾出茬口。各地根据这一特点，以一种就管，一管到底的精神管理晚晚秋作物，条条管理措施都从“早”字着眼，争取农时，促进早发育、早熟。
    内蒙古准备秋收工具
    内蒙古各地积极准备收割工具迎接秋收。扎赉特旗正组织一千四百多名能工巧匠，日夜突击制造高秆、矮秆作物收割机，玉米、谷子脱粒机，近二十天内共已制造出四百二十七台。宁城县试制成功的甜菜收获机、万能脱粒机、马铃薯收获机等十多种工具，都提高工效十倍以上，为加快秋收提供了有利条件。锡林郭勒盟除准备收割工具外，还修好了一万六千多个场院、两千多个马铃薯窖。
    拉萨旁多乡创牛羊繁殖新纪录
    西藏拉萨市所属林周县旁多乡牧民，打破过去母牛二年产一犊、羊一年一产一羔的习惯，创造出了母牛一年产一犊，母羊一年两产、一产多羔的新成绩。
    旁多乡今年有三百五十五头母牛一年产一犊，二百一十六只母羊一年两产，大部分一产多羔。
    由于这个乡的牧民采取了对母畜的“热窝配种”和加强了饲养管理，因此使很多母畜产仔量普遍提高。
