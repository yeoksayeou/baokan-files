Xinhua News Agency, London, September 21st: Hundreds of anti-hydrogen bomb demonstrators, starting from Edinburgh, Scotland, are marching towards London in a mighty procession, and have now reached Bedford.

The demonstrators set off from Edinburgh on September 4th, holding high flags and banners with the words "Ban Hydrogen Bombs," "Close American Bases Here," and "No (West) German Bases Allowed." Although they were sometimes soaked to the skin by the rain, and sometimes sweating profusely under the sun, they remained in high spirits along the way. They have marched three hundred and seventy miles, and have only thirty-two miles to go to reach their destination.

Along the way, hundreds more marchers joined the ranks, including members of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Communists, trade union members, and people from all walks of life.

The marchers collected thousands of signatures along the way for petitions against the hydrogen bomb and for the closure of American military bases in Britain.

The marching contingent was welcomed by people from all walks of life, including trade union members, housewives, students, mayors, and councilors. Hundreds of people's rallies were held in towns along the way to welcome the marchers. Prominent local figures made speeches against West German nuclear armament, against the production and testing of hydrogen bombs, and against the establishment of American military bases in Britain.

Xinhua News Agency, London, September 18th: The people of Ipswich, Britain, held a demonstration demanding the cancellation of the American base. About one hundred people marched fourteen miles this weekend to an American air base, demanding the immediate closure of American military bases in Britain. Ipswich Deputy Mayor Lewis also participated in the demonstration.

The demonstrators sent a six-person delegation to hand over a statement issued by the Ipswich Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament to the commander of the American air base.

The statement demanded the closure of the American base. The statement pointed out that "the idea of turning Britain into a war sacrifice for NATO military bases is completely unacceptable."

In Liverpool, hundreds of people also held a march protesting nuclear armament.

　　英国人民举行长途反氢弹示威游行
　  伊普斯威池居民要求取消美国基地
    新华社伦敦21日电　成百名反氢弹示威者从苏格兰爱丁堡出发，浩浩荡荡向伦敦进军，现在到达培德福德。
    示威者是9月4日从爱丁堡出发的，他们一路高举写着“禁止氢弹”、“关闭这里的美国基地”和“不准建立（西）德国基地”等字样的旗帜和标语牌。虽然他们有时候被雨淋得全身湿透，有时候被太阳晒得满头大汗，一路上仍然斗志昂扬。他们已经游行了三百七十英里，再走三十二英里就要到达目的地了。
    一路上又有几百名游行者参加了这支队伍，他们是裁减核军备团体的成员、共产党员、工会会员以及其他各阶层人士。
    游行者在沿途为反对氢弹和争取关闭美国在英国的军事基地的请愿书征集了几千个签名。
    这支游行队伍受到各阶层人民的欢迎，其中包括工会会员，家庭妇女，学生，市长和议员。沿途的各城镇举行了几百人的集会来欢迎游行者。地方上的著名人士发表演说反对西德核武装、反对生产和试验氢弹和美国在英国建立军事基地。
    新华社伦敦18日电　英国伊普斯威池地方的人民举行示威，要求取消美国基地。大约有一百人在本周末游行了十四英里，到达一个美国空军基地，要求立即封闭美国在英国的军事基地。伊普斯威池副市长刘易斯也参加了这次示威游行。
    示威者派了一个六人代表团把伊普斯威池争取裁减核军备运动发表的声明交给美国空军基地司令。
    这项声明要求封闭美国基地。声明指出，“把英国当成北大西洋公约组织军事基地的战争牺牲品的主张是完全不能接受的”。
    在利物浦，数以百计的人也举行了抗议核武装的游行。
