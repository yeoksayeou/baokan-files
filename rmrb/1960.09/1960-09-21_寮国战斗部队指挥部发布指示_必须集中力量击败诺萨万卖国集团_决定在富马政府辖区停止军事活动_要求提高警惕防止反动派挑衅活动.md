　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 20th: Lao Fighting Forces Radio broadcast today that in order to cooperate with the Souvanna Phouma government, to achieve a policy of national harmony and a truly peaceful and neutral policy, and to concentrate efforts to defeat the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, the Lao Fighting Forces Command issued instructions on September 18th. The instructions stated: Lao Fighting Forces, local forces, militia, and guerrillas in provinces such as Sam Neua, Phongsaly, Luang Prabang, and other areas under the jurisdiction of the Phouma government must immediately cease military activities until further notice.

　　The instructions also stated: Lao Fighting Forces stationed in various areas must contact local regimes and Royal Armed Forces that have already accepted the leadership of the Phouma government to jointly discuss the scope of deployment of both sides to avoid conflicts. The troops of both sides must remain stationed in place. The Royal Armed Forces should not continue "sweeping" operations, causing difficulties to the lives of the people, and guaranteeing the people's freedom of movement and all democratic rights and freedoms. The Royal Armed Forces and local regimes must immediately restore the freedom of Lao Fighting Forces personnel who are being imprisoned and must immediately stop taking discriminatory and retaliatory attitudes towards Lao Fighting Forces personnel, ensuring the safety and normal life of the people, opposing foreign interference, and opposing the Phoumi Nosavan group.

　　The instructions also stated: On the basis that both sides reach a consensus on the above issues and implement them, all cadres and soldiers must strictly abide by discipline, strictly implement these instructions, and at the same time, must increase vigilance to prevent the sabotage and provocative activities of the Lao reactionaries, lackeys of US imperialism, and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique. If the Royal Armed Forces in certain areas blindly follow the Phoumi Nosavan group on the road of treason and carry out "sweeping" operations against the people, they must resolutely eliminate them together with the local Royal Armed Forces to defend the people.

　　A spokesperson for the Lao Patriotic Front also issued a statement on September 18 regarding the situation in Sam Neua and Phongsaly. The statement pointed out that due to the distortion and slander by US imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, the Phouma government misunderstood the activities of the Lao Fighting Forces' armed forces in Sam Neua and Phongsaly and other places. It is clear that this misunderstanding will have adverse consequences for national unity.

　　The statement said that in order to oppose the conspiracy of US imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum-Nac Champassak clique, who are realizing the splitting of Laos, preparing to attack Vientiane, and overthrow the legitimate government of Phouma; in order to express the Lao Patriotic Front's sincere and solemn attitude towards the Phouma government and the coup committee headed by Captain Kong Le's policy of peaceful neutrality and national harmony; and in order to dispel the Phouma government's regrettable misunderstanding of the Lao Patriotic Front, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front authorized the General Command of the Lao Fighting Forces' armed forces on September 18, 1960 to instruct the Lao Fighting Forces' armed forces in areas under the control of the Phouma government to cease fire.

　　寮国战斗部队指挥部发布指示
　　必须集中力量击败诺萨万卖国集团
    决定在富马政府辖区停止军事活动  要求提高警惕防止反动派挑衅活动
    新华社河内20日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天广播，为了实现同梭发那·富马政府合作，实现民族和睦政策和真正的和平中立政策，为了集中力量以击败富米·诺萨万卖国集团，寮国战斗部队指挥部9月18日发布指示。指示说：桑怒、丰沙里、琅勃拉邦等省和富马政府管辖下其他各地的寮国战斗部队、地方部队、民兵和游击队必须立即停止军事活动，直到有新的指示为止。
    指示又说：驻在各地的寮国战斗部队必须同已经接受富马政府领导的当地政权和王国军队取得联系，共同讨论双方驻军范围，以避免发生冲突。双方军队必须原地驻扎。王国军队不应该继续进行“扫荡”，给人民的生活带来困难，并保证人民的自由来往和一切民主自由权利。王国军队和地方政权必须立即恢复正被监禁的寮国战斗部队人员的自由，并必须立即停止对寮国战斗部队人员采取歧视和报复的态度，保证人民的安全和正常生活，反对外国的干涉，反对富米·诺萨万集团。
    指示中还说：在双方对上述问题取得一致意见并加以实现的基础上，全体干部和战士必须严守纪律、严格履行本指示，同时必须提高警惕，防止美帝国主义的走狗老挝反动派和富米·诺萨万卖国集团的破坏和挑衅活动。如果某些地方的王国军队一味跟着富米·诺萨万集团走上叛国道路，向人民进行“扫荡”，那么，必须同当地的王国军队一起坚决消灭他们以保卫人民。
    老挝爱国战线党发言人9月18日还就桑怒和丰沙里的局势发表了声明，声明指出，由于美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万叛国集团的歪曲和污蔑，使富马政府误解了寮国战斗部队武装力量在桑怒和丰沙里以及其他一些地方的活动。很明显，这种误解对民族的团结将造成不良的后果。
    声明说，为了反对美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞集团正在实现分裂老挝、准备进攻万象和推翻富马合法政府的阴谋；为了表示老挝爱国战线党对富马政府和以贡勒大尉为首的政变委员会的和平中立和民族和睦政策的诚恳和严正态度；为了取消富马政府对老挝爱国战线党遗憾的误会，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会在1960年9月18日授权寮国战斗部队武装力量总指挥部指示在富马政府控制下的地方的寮国战斗部队武装力量停火。
