Qixin Serves the "Three Autumns"

　　A Duty That Cannot Be Shirked
    In order to support the "Three Autumns" campaign and help the communes with electrical appliance installation, the Dalian No. 2 Electric Motor Factory recently sent additional workers and technicians to the Fuzhou Commune. A few days ago, the workers who went to the commune called, saying that there were many tasks and not enough manpower. The next day, Factory Director Xie personally led two technicians to provide support.

    After arriving at the Fuzhou Commune, Factory Director Xie learned that this year's autumn harvest task was very heavy and that there was a shortage of sickles. He immediately called the factory and asked everyone to help solve the problem quickly. When the workers heard the news, they felt that it was their unshirkable responsibility, and everyone expressed their desire to take immediate action to guarantee one sickle per person. That evening, the battle began. The factory was filled with the sound of clanging. In order to ensure the sharpness of the sickles, the Party branch entrusted the task of quenching to Master Wang Xiufan, a renowned craftsman, because the blades of the sickles he quenched were the hardest. In this way, everyone worked for more than an hour and made more than 500 good sickles. (Attached picture)

　　义不容辞
    大连第二电机厂为了支援“三秋”，帮助公社做好电器安装架设工作，不久前，又增派了一些工人、技术人员到复州公社去。前两天，到公社去的工人来过电话，说任务多，人手不够。谢厂长第二天就亲自出马，领着两名技术人员前去支援。
    谢厂长到复州公社后，听说今年秋收任务很重，镰刀缺乏，又马上给厂里挂电话，要大家赶快帮助解决。职工们听到了这个消息后，感到这是自己义不容辞的责任，个个表示要立即行动，保证一人一把镰。当天晚上，这场战斗就开始了。全厂响起了一片叮当声。为了保证镰刀刃快，党总支把淬火的任务交给了有名的工匠王秀范师傅，因为他淬出的镰刀刀刃最硬。就这样，大家战斗了一个多小时，就造好了五百多把好镰刀。（附图片）
