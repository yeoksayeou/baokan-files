Xinhua News Agency Report: This year, more than 10,000 small pulp mills newly built across the country have used indigenous methods and locally produced rice straw, wheat straw, or wild grasses as raw materials to produce 310,000 tons of indigenous grass pulp for use as papermaking material.

　　This pulp is an urgently needed important raw material for the papermaking industry. Every 1.5 tons of indigenous grass pulp can produce approximately one ton of cultural paper or packaging paper; if mixed with some wood pulp or other chemical pulp, it can also be used to manufacture more advanced paper. This year, approximately one-sixth or more of the machine-made paper produced nationwide is made using indigenous grass pulp as a raw material.

　　People's communes in rural areas running small pulp mills to preliminarily process grasses into pulp is a new method of producing papermaking raw materials. In the past, raw materials such as reeds, bamboo, and rice straw used by many large paper mills were almost all directly transported from the production area to large factories for further processing into pulp. Rice straw, wheat straw, and the like are light and buoyant materials, and are very bulky, making direct transportation both wasteful of transport capacity and inconvenient. Now, many people's communes, based on the principles of obtaining materials locally, processing them locally, and selling them locally, have established a large number of small factories, using various grass resources in rural areas to process them into pulp, and then transporting them to large factories for papermaking. This not only makes full use of dispersed resources, but also greatly reduces the volume of grasses after being processed into pulp, making it easy to transport, saving a large amount of transport capacity, and also saving some processing and storage equipment for large factories. According to the experience of Baicheng Prefecture in Jilin Province, transporting grasses to large factories after processing them into pulp can save half of the transportation capacity.

　　Many provinces and cities, when developing indigenous grass pulp, mostly adopt the method of demarcating areas and designating locations, organizing people's communes to link up with large paper mills and establish fixed supply relationships, which can strengthen worker-peasant cooperation and ensure the quality of indigenous grass pulp.

### 全国新建一万多个小纸浆厂  各地人民公社用草类生产出三十一万吨土草浆供应造纸需要

　　全国新建一万多个小纸浆厂
　  各地人民公社用草类生产出三十一万吨土草浆供应造纸需要
    据新华社讯　今年全国各地新建的一万多个小纸浆厂，用土办法和当地出产的稻草、麦秸或野生草类作原料，生产了三十一万吨作造纸原料用的土草浆。
    这种纸浆是造纸工业迫切需要的重要原料。每一吨半土草浆大约能造一吨文化用纸或包装纸；如搭配一些木浆或其他化学浆也可以制造比较高级的纸。今年全国所生产的机制纸中大约有六分之一以上是用土草浆作原料造成的。
    由农村人民公社办小纸浆厂把草类初步加工成纸浆，这是生产造纸原料的一种新办法。过去许多大纸厂所用的芦苇、竹子、稻草等原料，差不多都是由产地直接运送到大工厂再加工成纸浆。稻草、麦秸等都是轻浮物资，体积很大，直接运输既浪费运输力又不方便。现在许多人民公社根据就地取材、就地加工、就地销售的原则，建立大量小厂，利用农村各种草类资源加工成纸浆，再运到大厂造纸。这样既能充分利用分散的资源，同时草类加工成纸浆之后，体积大大缩小，便于运输，又能节省大量运输力，还可以为大工厂节省一些加工和保管的设备。据吉林省白城专区的经验，把草类加工成纸浆，再运送到大工厂去，运输力可以节省一半。
    许多省、市在发展土草浆时，大都采用划片定点的办法，组织人民公社和大造纸厂挂钩，建立固定的供应关系，这样可以加强工农协作，保证土草浆的质量。
