Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing. Commercial departments in Chongqing are adopting the method of sending personnel, technology, and means of production down to the countryside to support rural "Three Autumns" production. Based on the current production needs of the countryside, Chongqing's commercial departments have actively transferred a batch of drought-resistant equipment to the rural areas of Qijiang, Changshou, Ba County, and various districts in the city's suburbs. The Municipal Bureau of Commerce has drawn a group of technicians from various state-owned companies to form three teams to install and repair water pumps in various counties. Cotton-producing areas in Shehong County, Sichuan, and parts of Yibin and Ba County have experienced insect infestations. The Municipal Chemical Raw Materials Company staff immediately organized a batch of trucks and transported DDT, 666 and other insecticides, and also sent technicians with the vehicles to guide farmers in the use of pesticides to support these areas in time to eliminate the insect pests.

The demand for agricultural tools and fertilizers needed for this year's Three Autumns production is very large. On the one hand, Chongqing's commercial departments are using the favorable conditions of large cities to organize the delivery of agricultural tools and fertilizers to the countryside; on the other hand, they are mobilizing rural people's communes and rural supply and marketing cooperatives to obtain materials locally, produce locally, and supply locally. In addition to transferring a large number of nitrogen fertilizers according to the third-quarter plan, the Municipal Commercial Department organized more than 700 tons of calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer beyond the plan to be sent to the countryside. The Municipal Hardware and Electrical Appliance Company has transported more than 2,600 tons of Three Autumns production materials to the countryside by means of producing, purchasing, and allocating them as soon as possible. In addition, commercial departments have recently supplied 220,000 jin of autumn vegetable seeds to the communes in the suburbs of the city, and have transferred a batch of improved vegetable seeds from Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang and other places to supply the rural people's communes.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin. Workers at the Jiamusi Agricultural Machinery Factory launched a production increase and conservation competition, and in August alone, they rushed to produce 300 large threshing machines, equal to 60% of the total output in the first seven months. This batch of threshing machines is being transported to the countryside for use during the autumn harvest.

After discussion in August, the workers of the Jiamusi Agricultural Machinery Factory formulated production increase and conservation plans and measures for August to December at the workshop, team, machine tool, and individual levels. During the discussion, the workers made a calculation based on the surveyed materials: increasing the production of one more threshing machine can save the countryside 75 laborers and 100 horses for the autumn harvest; increasing the production of one more water pump can irrigate 350 mu of farmland. Therefore, their sense of responsibility to support agriculture has been further enhanced.

In the competition, all the workers in the factory proposed to break through the "three barriers" of equipment, materials, and technology; strive to achieve "five firsts" in output, quality, product performance, safety, and low cost; and realize "five one topping three" such as one person topping three people, one machine topping three machines, one material topping three materials, one day topping three days, and one factory topping three factories. By the end of August, the factory had implemented 110 major measures, and the production efficiency of half of the workers had reached the level of one person topping three people.

    重庆商业部门组织人员技术物资三下乡
    佳木斯农械厂8月份赶制出大型脱谷机三百台
    据新华社重庆讯　重庆市商业部门采取人员、技术、生产资料三下乡的办法，支援农村“三秋”生产。重庆市商业部门根据农村当前生产的需要，积极调运了一批抗旱器材到綦江、长寿、巴县和市郊各区农村。市商业局从各国营公司抽出一批技术人员组成三个队，到各县安装和检修抽水机。四川射洪县产棉区和宜宾、巴县部分地区曾发生虫害。市化工原料公司职工立即组织一批汽车，运去了滴滴涕、六六六等杀虫药剂，又随车派去技术人员指导农民使用农药，支援这些地区及时扑灭了虫害。
    今年三秋生产需要的农具和农肥数量很大。重庆商业部门一方面利用大城市的有利条件，组织农具、肥料下乡；一方面发动农村人民公社和农村供销社，就地取材，就地生产，就地供应。市商业部门除了按第三季度计划，调出大批氮肥以外，又在计划以外组织了七百多吨钙镁磷肥下乡。市五金交电公司用随生产、随收购、随调拨的办法，已经调运了二千六百多吨三秋生产资料下乡。此外，商业部门在最近还供应了市郊公社秋菜种子二十二万多斤，并从上海、广州、沈阳等地调来一批蔬菜良种供应农村人民公社。
    据新华社哈尔滨讯　佳木斯农业机械厂职工开展增产节约竞赛，在8月份一个月就赶制出三百台大型脱谷机，等于前7个月产量总和的60％。这批脱谷机正运往农村供秋收时使用。
    佳木斯农业机械厂的职工，在8月份经过讨论，按车间、小组、机台和个人，层层制订了8月到12月的增产节约计划和措施。职工们在讨论中根据调查的材料算了一笔账：多增产一台脱谷机，就可以使农村节约用于秋收的劳动力七十五人、马一百匹；增产一台水泵，就可以多灌溉三百五十亩农田。因此都更加增强了支援农业的责任感。
    在竞赛中，全厂职工提出要猛闯设备、材料、技术“三关”；争取达到产量、质量、产品效能、安全、低成本等“五个第一”；实现一人顶三人、一机顶三机、一料顶三料、一天顶三天、一厂顶三厂等“五个一顶三”。到8月底，全厂实现了一百一十项重大措施，有一半职工的生产效率达到了一人顶三人。
