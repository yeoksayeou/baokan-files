Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda has been giving speeches in various places recently, and has been surrounded and ridiculed by demonstrating workers and students everywhere.
    When Ikeda arrived at Nagoya train station yesterday, he was surrounded as soon as he got off the train by two hundred demonstrating students waiting on the platform. The students wanted to hand Ikeda a protest letter against the Ikeda government's suppression of participants in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," but the police blocked them, and the two sides became entangled. Japanese radio said: at the time, "Prime Minister Ikeda, who was caught in the crowd," was pushed around by the students and "almost fell off the platform." Finally, about a hundred policemen rushed to "rescue" Ikeda and escape by car to the Nagoya Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
    According to the "Yomiuri Shimbun," in Hiroshima City, about six hundred day laborers demonstrated in front of the Hiroshima Prefectural Government on the 14th, waiting for Ikeda's arrival. After Ikeda arrived, the workers surrounded him, demanding that the Ikeda government guarantee their livelihoods and increase social insurance payments. However, Ikeda ignored them and fled by car.
    In addition, three hundred temporary workers demonstrated in front of a middle school where a reception was arranged to welcome Ikeda, demanding to meet with Ikeda and present to him the tragic situation of the temporary workers' lives. When Ikeda's car drove to the main entrance, the workers surrounded the car, shouting slogans such as "No banquets allowed in schools!" and opposing the Ikeda government. Ikeda dared not meet with the workers. Under the protection of the police, he sneaked into the hall through the back door.
    When Ikeda arrived in Takamatsu City by boat, a thousand workers were already waiting next to the dock. The "Mainichi Shimbun" said that Ikeda tried his best to get rid of the working masses, and the workers all made mocking sounds.
    The "Nishi-Nippon Shimbun" said that in Hakata City, famous for its clay dolls, more than 30 students wanted to hand Ikeda a letter of inquiry, but Ikeda dared not meet them.
    It is reported that Ikeda was also similarly besieged in Osaka and Fukuoka.

    池田到各地演说旅行  处处受示威群众包围
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本首相池田勇人最近到各地作演说旅行时，到处遭到示威工人和学生们的围困和奚落。
    池田昨天到达名古屋火车站时，一下火车就被等待在月台上的二百名示威学生包围起来。学生们想要把抗议池田政府镇压反对日美“安全条约”斗争的参加者的抗议书交给池田，但警察们加以阻挡，双方扭成一团。日本电台说：当时，
  “卷在人群中的池田首相”被学生们推来推去“几乎从月台上掉下去”。最后，大约一百名警察赶去，才把池田“救出来”，坐汽车逃到名古屋商工会议所去。
    据“读卖新闻”报道，在广岛市，六百名左右散工14日在广岛县政府前面示威，等待池田到达。在池田到达后，工人们就把他包围起来，纷纷要求池田政府保证他们的生活能过得去，增加社会保险费。但是，池田竟然不理他们，乘了汽车就逃走。
    另外，有三百名临时工人在安排欢迎池田的招待会的一所中学前面示威，要求会见池田，向他陈述临时工人生活悲惨的景况。当池田的汽车开到正门的时候，工人们包围了汽车，高呼：“不许在学校里举行宴会！”以及反对池田政府的口号。池田不敢同工人们会见，他在警察的保护下，从后门偷偷溜进大厅。
    当池田乘船到达高松市的时候，一千名工人已经等候在码头旁边。“每日新闻”说，池田竭力想摆脱工人群众，工人们一齐发出嘲笑声。
    “西日本新闻”说，在以出产泥人出名的博多市，三十多名学生要把质问书交给池田，而池田不敢接见这些学生。
    据报道，池田在大阪和福冈等城市也受到类似的围困。
