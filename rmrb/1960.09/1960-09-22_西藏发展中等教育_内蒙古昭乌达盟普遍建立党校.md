Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 20th: Lhasa Middle School held its first graduation ceremony and the establishment of its high school division on the 15th. One hundred and thirty graduates from the junior high school and the teacher training class attached to the school received their diplomas at the meeting. More than 700 students, parents, and representatives from elementary schools in Lhasa attended the meeting to congratulate the graduates.

	Acting Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Panchen Erdeni, and Deputy Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, Zhou Renshan, attended the meeting and congratulated the graduates and Lhasa Middle School on the establishment of its high school division. They pointed out that this marks a further development in the cultural and educational undertakings in the Tibetan region under the leadership of the Party. In his speech, Panchen Erdeni emphasized that the purpose of learning is to serve the working people and the cause of proletarian construction, and that it is necessary to change the situation in which intellectuals look down on labor and do not understand farming. He said: The school should further develop work-study programs to closely integrate learning with production practice.

	Shigatse Middle School was also officially established in Shigatse on the 11th. This is the second middle school established in the Tibetan region after Lhasa Middle School. More than 1,500 students and parents from Shigatse City attended the celebration meeting for the establishment of the school. The school currently has three classes with more than 90 students.

	This newspaper reports: Party organizations at all levels in the Zhaowuda League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have universally established Party schools to improve the leadership level of grassroots cadres. At present, 1,439 full-time and spare-time Party schools have been established, spread throughout the towns and cities, vast rural areas, and pastoral areas under the league's jurisdiction, forming a Party school network.

	Party schools at all levels resolutely implement the educational policy of serving politics and production, and adopt the method of "stop training during peak season and concentrate on production; reduce training during busy season and select key personnel; increase training during less busy season and select more key personnel; conduct large-scale training during slack season and provide universal training," so that cadres at all levels and the majority of workers, farmers, and herdsmen Party members can receive one to two relatively systematic theoretical educations each year in batches and according to plan.
