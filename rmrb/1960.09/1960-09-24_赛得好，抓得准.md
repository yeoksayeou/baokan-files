　　Good Competition, Accurate Grasp
    The two coal preparation plants of Fushun's Laohutai Mine and Longfeng Mine are competing to see who delivers more refined coal to iron and steel enterprises, who produces better quality refined coal, and who loses less in processing refined raw coal. This is an extremely meaningful competition.
    With coal, iron can be smelted; with iron, steel can be made. One link connects to another, and none can be broken. From the perspective of coal production, the first priority is increasing coking coal production. With coking coal, it is also necessary to carefully wash and sort it. The more coking coal washed, the less loss during washing, and the more meticulous the washing and sorting work, the higher the quality and output of refined coal. High quality and high yield of refined coal guarantee the high quality and high yield of coke and pig iron.
    What is the way to achieve this goal? The important thing is to fully mobilize the masses and seize the key to production. Starting from the key, we must effectively solve key problems. After the two coal preparation plants of Laohutai Mine and Longfeng Mine put forward the competition conditions, they first grasped the important key of improving equipment utilization, which greatly increased the amount of raw coal washed. Then, they seized the key of improving the recovery rate of refined coal, set up a "recovery formation," and spread a "dense net," greatly reducing the loss rate of raw coal.
    In the entire steel production process, the higher the wave of competition and the greater the increase in output, the more attention must be paid to quality and raw material consumption, and the more in-depth and specific the leadership work must be. The competition conditions of the coal preparation plants of Fushun Laohutai and Longfeng mines and their approach of focusing on key points are worthy of reference by all coal preparation plants.

　　赛得好，抓得准
    抚顺老虎台矿和龙凤矿的两个选煤厂之间，比谁给钢铁企业送去的精煤多，比谁加工出来的精煤质量好，比谁加工精制原煤的损失少。这是一项极有意义的竞赛。
    有了煤，才能炼铁，有了铁，才能有炼钢，一环扣一环，丝毫也不能脱节。从煤的生产来看，首先又在于焦煤的增产。有了焦煤，还必须认真洗选。入洗的焦煤愈多，洗的过程中损耗愈少，洗选的工作越细，精煤就能优质高产。精煤优质高产，焦炭和生铁的优质高产才有保证。
    通过什么途径达到这个目标？重要的在于充分发动群众，抓住生产关键。从关键入手，切实解决关键问题。老虎台矿和龙凤矿的两个选煤厂提出竞赛条件以后，首先抓住了提高设备利用率这个重要关键，使原煤入洗量大大增加，接着，又抓住提高精煤回收率，摆开“回收阵”，撒下“密网”，使原煤损失率大大减少。
    在整个钢铁生产中，竞赛的热浪越高，产量的增长越大，对质量和原料消耗越要特别注意，领导工作也就越要深入、具体。抚顺老虎台和龙凤两个矿的选煤厂的竞赛条件及其狠抓关键的做法，值得各选煤厂参考。
