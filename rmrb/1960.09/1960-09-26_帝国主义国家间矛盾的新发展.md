　　New Developments in Contradictions Among Imperialist Countries
　　Su Lan
　　Recently, extensive diplomatic activities have been conducted among Western European countries. Following the Adenauer-de Gaulle meeting at the end of July and the Macmillan-Adenauer meeting at the beginning of August, many bilateral meetings at the level of heads of government or foreign ministers have been held between the governments of Western European countries. It is reported that such meetings will continue to be held.
　　These frequent bilateral meetings are being conducted on the basis of the continuous changes in the balance of power among imperialist countries over a long period of time. Some are expressed as mutual wooing, and some are expressed as mutual infighting. Although the content of the talks is not disclosed much, it is not difficult for people to see that Western European countries are trying to readjust their relations with each other and with the United States, and prepare a new foundation for further mutual struggle.
　　(I)
　　Several meetings and a series of recent facts have fully exposed the deep contradictions between Britain, France, and West Germany in the struggle for hegemony in Western Europe. It is revealed that the "European integration" issue, the issue of two opposing economic groups in Europe, the issue of suppressing and dividing colonial independence movements (mainly how to control Africa), and the issue of the development of nuclear weapons by various countries (mainly the issue of arming the West German Bundeswehr with nuclear weapons) were all discussed in the de Gaulle-Adenauer and Macmillan-Adenauer meetings. In the final analysis, these issues involve: who will become the master of Western Europe.
　　De Gaulle advocated the establishment of a "European Confederation" by the six Common Market countries, the establishment of a permanent "Political Secretariat" in Paris, and the establishment of a Council of Prime Ministers and a Council of Foreign Ministers. After decisions are made on major issues, France would act as the spokesperson for the six countries, thereby establishing a tripartite leadership core of the United States, Britain, and France. This is another effort by France to organize a "third force" and to strive for political leadership in Western Europe. France has always regarded the "Common Market" as a stepping stone for it to ascend to the position of hegemon in Western Europe. In this regard, France is deeply afraid that Britain's approach to the "Common Market" will hinder de Gaulle's ambition to seize hegemony in Western Europe. Therefore, France expressed deep concern about the Adenauer-Macmillan meeting. The Paris newspaper "Le Monde" revealed that de Gaulle understood very well that "in a Europe with British participation, he would not be able to play the superior role that he believes he is qualified to demand on the continent." At present, France's repeated emphasis on "Franco-German reconciliation" and its efforts to prevent Britain from entering the European continent best demonstrate France's mood. But on the other hand, the continuous growth of West Germany's economic strength and military power, especially the West German Bundeswehr's intensified actions to arm itself with nuclear weapons, also make France deeply uneasy. Under such circumstances, a desire has begun to appear, overtly or covertly, among the bourgeoisie in France to improve relations with Britain in order to jointly limit the development of West German power. Mendès-France said in an article published on September 6: "Two countries can stimulate the necessary revival of the West, as long as they unite. They are Britain and France." In fact, the relationship between France and West Germany within the "Common Market" is not harmonious. On the contrary, the conflicting interests of the monopoly capital of the two countries are becoming increasingly apparent. For example, with the West German industrial sector's opposition to accelerating the pace of the "Common Market" in the Hallstein Plan, an open quarrel has recently occurred between France and West Germany over agricultural policy. The West German newspaper "Die Welt" worriedly pointed out that the "public outbreak" of this crisis would plunge "European integration" into a "stalemate." Of course, the relationship between the monopoly capital of the two countries within the "Common Market" will not break down, but it is very clear that with the further development of the "Common Market," cracks have already appeared in this economic group.
　　The situation of several meetings shows that Britain is trying to break the isolated situation it has been in on the European continent since the failure of the "Free Trade Area Plan." Recently, Britain's policy toward its continental allies has sometimes been to pull France and suppress Germany, and sometimes to pull Germany and suppress France, in order to establish a new balance of power and raise Britain's position in Western European affairs. Britain and France share a common position in controlling West Germany's nuclear armament and preventing West Germany from expanding into their colonies. However, Britain has expressed great concern about De Gaulle's ambition to dominate Western Europe. In response to De Gaulle's proposal for a "Political Secretariat," Britain insisted on its own "European Customs Union" plan, attempting to use this to break into the European continent and then dismantle the "Common Market." On the issue of the two economic groups in Western Europe, Britain's position has long been opposed to France's. France's attitude has become the main obstacle for Britain to reach an agreement with the "Common Market." Britain's current expression of "intimacy" with West Germany is a new attempt to change its isolated position by using the internal contradictions of the "Common Market." Britain has also adopted an ambiguous attitude toward France's request to become a member of the "atomic club" and has not supported it.
　　This is one aspect of British policy. Due to class hatred for socialist countries and in order to break the situation of France and West Germany uniting to deal with Britain, another aspect of British policy is to support the rearmament of West German militarism and support West Germany's cold war stance on the German issue and the West Berlin issue. Recently, British Defense Minister Watkinson and West German Defense Minister Strauss consulted and prepared to jointly produce missile weapons, so that the two countries will further collude militarily. It is revealed that in the Macmillan-Adenauer meeting, Britain supported West Germany's "uncompromising attitude" on the West Berlin issue in exchange for Britain's "favorable position" in the Western European economy. However, Britain is very uneasy about the expansion of West Germany's military power. Britain is resolutely opposed to the United States' plan to arm West Germany with "Polaris" missiles and regard West Germany as the core force of the North Atlantic Group, because it conflicts with Britain's interests in seizing hegemony in Western Europe. What Britain hopes is that West Germany's rearmament will be carried out within the scope allowed by Britain and within the scope that Britain can control -- of course, this wish is doomed to fail.
　　France's "Political Secretariat" plan and Britain's "European Customs Union" plan are very different from West Germany's proposals. West Germany emphasizes "integration," advocating merging the "Common Market," the "Coal and Steel Community," and the "Atomic Community" into a unified organization and establishing a supranational power institution. And in this institution, West Germany, by virtue of its own economic strength, has become the de facto "leader." West Germany's proposal fully reflects the ambition of West German monopoly capital to seize the leadership of Western Europe, and at the same time reflects to a certain extent the United States' opinion on the Western European issue. As everyone knows, due to the active support of West Germany by U.S. imperialism, Adenauer often became the spokesperson for the United States in Western Europe when the Bonn government met with France and Britain.
　　West Germany is currently in the position of a second-class country because it is subject to certain political and military constraints by international treaties. This is far from commensurate with its status as a first-class economic power. West Germany is trying to break through these restrictions and overthrow the current balance of power in Western Europe. In addition to continuing to expand its influence economically and raising its position politically, the Bonn government is trying to strengthen its military power. West Germany is eager to obtain U.S. "Polaris" missiles and strives to possess its own manufactured nuclear weapons. On the same day that Macmillan arrived in Bonn, the communiqué issued by the West German government proposed to make the West German Navy a modern force capable of launching nuclear weapons. The British "Daily Express" also revealed that during the British-West German meeting, "the worried Adenauer strongly argued for the various reasons why he insisted on strengthening European defense." West Germany is well aware that its frenzied arms expansion activities, especially its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons, will inevitably arouse suspicion from Britain and France. To this end, West Germany is cautiously using the contradictions between Britain and France. On the one hand, West Germany emphasizes the importance of the Paris-Bonn axis and supports France's nuclear armament plan with its own economic strength, forcing France to cooperate with it in the production of nuclear weapons, and exchanging support for de Gaulle on the Algerian issue for France to speak for West Germany on the German issue and the West Berlin issue, and doing its best to prevent Britain and France from re-forming an anti-German alliance. On the other hand, Bonn has expressed public dissatisfaction with De Gaulle's attempt to establish a "troika" leadership, and has to some extent "improved relations" with Britain. The West German newspaper "Die Welt" said meaningfully: "What needs to be done now is to make up for what was delayed in the past. In addition to maintaining Franco-German friendship, it cannot affect relations with Britain, but rather establish it on an equal footing." West Germany's "approach" to Britain shows that the Bonn government is unwilling to be tied up by the "Common Market," hindering it from opening up a wider market, and therefore attempts to play the role of "mediator" between the "six countries" and the "seven countries." The "Times" commented on the British-West German meeting: Adenauer expressed his willingness to find ways to continue the duty-free import system of the Commonwealth to the 'Common Market'; this report made a strong annotation to West Germany's policy on Western European economic issues. It is worth noting that West Germany not only wants to absorb Britain into the "Common Market" to facilitate its own economic expansion, but also to prevent De Gaulle from seizing Western European political hegemony, and is planning to use this as bait to induce Britain to support its nuclear armament plan.
　　From this relationship of mutual collusion and mutual infighting, it can be seen that with France's efforts to enhance its international status, with Britain's active activities to change its isolated situation in Western Europe, and with the continuous development of West Germany's economic and political power, the contradictions between Western European countries have not eased, but have continued to deepen. Meetings and other diplomatic activities only show that they want to win over one side in a certain period or on a certain issue in order to attack the other side. Therefore, this will not only not mean the easing of the struggle between them, but on the contrary, it can only mean that a new and more fierce struggle is brewing.
　　(II)
　　From the comments of Western newspapers, it can be seen that Western European countries are stepping up their activities of engaging in alliances and counter-alliances, not only to compete for hegemony in Western Europe, but also to take advantage of the decline of the United States' influence in Western Europe to strengthen the position and voice of Western European countries in the Western camp by reorganizing the strength of Western European countries. The Adenauer-de Gaulle meeting and the Macmillan-Adenauer meeting both show that the centrifugal tendency of Western European countries--especially Britain and France--toward the United States has further developed.
　　The growth of the centrifugal tendency of Western European countries toward the United States is taking place under the following circumstances: Recently, the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have reached a new upsurge, and the world peace movement has further developed. After the four-nation summit was sabotaged by the United States, the peace mask of U.S. imperialism was completely exposed to the people of the world. As a result, the prestige of the United States within the imperialist group has declined unprecedentedly, and its leading position in the capitalist world has undergone new changes. Western European countries are trying to take advantage of the great weakening of the United States' position to raise their status in international affairs. Reuters has bluntly stated: Since the failure of the four-nation summit, world power has changed unfavorably to the United States. Therefore, the meeting is mainly to "deal with and offset" the weaknesses in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and "the weaknesses in the U.S. leadership of the West" as much as possible. In addition, the United States is currently busy with domestic elections and has no time to take care of Western European affairs, and Western European countries also believe that this is a great opportunity to force the United States to retreat.
　　The French-West German meeting and the British-West German meeting undoubtedly involved the issue of the relationship between Western European countries and the United States. The West German "General Report" pointed out in its comments on the British-West German meeting: "The role of Europe in world politics in the future is an important topic of the Bonn meeting." Before and after the meeting, Western newspapers revealed that Western European countries advocated strengthening "political consultation," not only to "demand greater voice" from the United States and "increase the weight of Western Europe in the North Atlantic," but also to gradually get rid of the United States' control over Western Europe. The British "Sunday Times" openly advocated that Western Europe should be "led" by Britain, France, and West Germany. Reuters reporter Earl wrote as early as when he announced that Macmillan and Adenauer would hold a meeting that, in the current period, due to the "reduction of U.S. influence abroad," "many countries are taking a new view of the issue of European (Western European) integration." The British magazine "The Economist" openly expressed dissatisfaction with the United States, saying, "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization hardly exists as a military alliance, but rather as a cover for the Pentagon's control policy." The French "Combat" advocated "...in order to prevent the isolationism of the United States, or in order not to cede the leadership of the West to the United States, and in order to finally include Africa in the Western sphere of influence, a political Europe must be established." De Gaulle repeatedly emphasized his proposal to revise the North Atlantic Treaty in his speech at the press conference on September 5, especially before and after these two meetings. On the Congo issue, he also requested "the establishment of a tripartite guidance mechanism responsible for Western strategy," which is essentially to limit the expansion of the United States in Africa and weaken the United States' position in Western Europe.
　　The struggle between the United States and Western European countries is essentially a long-term struggle between control and anti-control. France has been resisting the military control of the United States. De Gaulle has expressed firm opposition to the so-called "integration" plan of the North Atlantic Group. France refused the United States to set up missile bases in France, refused to merge the French tactical air force into the Atlantic command system, and even wanted to take back its naval command in the Mediterranean. Britain, on the one hand, used the relationship of the "Anglo-American alliance" to compete for hegemony in Western Europe, and on the other hand, used its pivotal position in the capitalist world to bargain with the United States. Politically, Britain always trumpets the incompetence of the United States whenever U.S. aggressive policies are frustrated. Especially after the United States sabotaged the four-nation summit, British newspapers did not miss any of the United States' diplomatic embarrassments, ridiculed the United States as much as possible, and demanded that the United States and Britain jointly lead the West. Militarily, Britain insisted on having an "independent deterrent force" despite the opposition of the United States, and wanted to manufacture part of the missiles and nuclear warheads itself. Britain also expressed dissatisfaction with the United States' practice of controlling the North Atlantic Group single-handedly. Just after Macmillan returned from Bonn, the British press launched a movement to overthrow the "Allied" Commander-in-Chief of the North Atlantic Group, U.S. General Norstad. Reuters deliberately released such an atmosphere: There is a view circulating among "some national delegation officials" in the North Atlantic Group: "Americans hold too many important positions in the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, if not all important positions." The "Daily Telegraph" also shouted, "Now is the time for someone to take a new view of the strategic thinking contained in the current plan to defend Western Europe." Economically, Britain expressed open dissatisfaction with the United States' support for the "Common Market."
　　Of course, the United States will not ignore this "rebellious" behavior of Western European countries. Recently, Washington has spent a lot of effort in strengthening its control over Western Europe. As early as last October, the report on the policy toward Western Europe published by the U.S. Senate and Acheson's "Ten-Year Plan" on the North Atlantic Group published in West Germany both emphasized the "centralized leadership" and "direct leadership" of the United States over Western Europe. Obviously, the purpose of the United States is not only to ensure its position as the leader of the North Atlantic Group and prevent Western Europe from "splitting the court," but also to reduce the role of the "Anglo-American alliance" and prevent Britain from enjoying a "preferential" position in the Western alliance. U.S. Secretary of State Herter recently stated even more specifically that the U.S. government is capable of taking major diplomatic actions during the election period. The "New York Herald Tribune" also reminded people not to forget when commenting on the British-West German meeting: "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is the 'basic element of Western power,' and the strength of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization relies on the United States." On September 6, U.S. State Department spokesman White also made a statement on De Gaulle's speech, stating that the U.S. view on the Atlantic Group remains unchanged and reiterated the "Ten-Year Plan" of the North Atlantic Group. It is conceivable that the United States will make greater use of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the future and strengthen the United States' leadership position through a series of "integration" plans. For example, militarily, lower the status of Britain and France, raise West Germany, and use names such as the so-called "multinational atomic institution" to restrict the "independent nuclear deterrent force" of Britain and France; politically, make the North Atlantic Group have "greater decision-making power" in name, and all member states, large and small, participate in decision-making with the status of "equal partners," resisting the "independent diplomacy" and "great power leadership principle" of Britain and France; economically, also directly grasp the leadership of Western European economic affairs, reorganize the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau" controlled by Britain, and attempt to turn it into a so-called "Atlantic Economic Community," so that the United States and Canada can participate. Therefore, the United States' main policy in Western Europe in the future will be: to separately control Britain and France, continue to support West Germany, and regard West Germany as the backbone of the North Atlantic Group and as the flag bearer of Western European "integration." And the result of the implementation of this policy by the United States will not be to ease, but to aggravate the contradictions between Western European countries, and make the struggle of the United States to control Western Europe intertwined with the struggle for hegemony between Western European countries, making the situation more complicated.
　　(III)
　　The intricate and complex contradictions within the imperialist group, in the final analysis, reflect the irreconcilable conflicts of interest between the monopoly groups of various countries in the economic field. The formation and development of the socialist market has greatly reduced the capitalist market, and the further aggravation of the contradiction between capitalist production and consumption has led to frequent economic crises and shortened cycles. This cannot but promote the increasingly acute struggle of imperialism to seize markets and spheres of influence, and accelerate the ebb and flow of power among countries.
　　The weakening of the ruling position of the United States in the imperialist group, the development of the centrifugal tendency of Western European countries, and the competition among Britain, France, and West Germany are the inevitable results of the changes in the economic power of capitalist countries. After the capitalist economic crisis of 1957-1958, the United States' competitiveness in foreign markets was at its lowest point since the war. In the past two years, the proportion of U.S. exports in the capitalist world has dropped from 23.3% to 21.3%. In 1959, the U.S. trade with Western Europe showed a deficit for the first time since the war. The U.S. balance of payments deficit totaled $7.1 billion in two years, and the outflow of gold and U.S. dollars totaled $3.3 billion. The value of gold reserves has now fallen below $19 billion, the lowest point in 20 years, while at the same time, the economic strength of Western European countries that have long relied on the United States has been strengthened. The proportion of foreign trade in West Germany and France has increased significantly in the past two years. The division of the capitalist unified market into three has made it more difficult for the United States to control Western Europe. The opposition between the two economic groups of the "Common Market" and the "Little Free Trade Area," and the trade war in which both sides build high tariff barriers, will inevitably affect U.S. trade with Western Europe. Moreover, economic division will inevitably deepen the political division within the North Atlantic Group. This is also not conducive to the consolidation of U.S. leadership. However, the United States is also afraid that the "Six Countries" and the "Seven Countries" groups will unite to form an exclusive European economic group, which not only makes it impossible for the United States to use contradictions, but also has the danger of Western Europe uniting to jointly deal with the United States. The United States' attitude has always been to take advantage of the disputes between the "Six Countries" and the "Seven Countries" to intervene in Western European economic affairs and strengthen its economic control over Western Europe. The United States advocates organizing a "North Atlantic Community" of the "Six Countries," the "Seven Countries," the United States, and Canada, so that it can both prevent Western Europe from excluding and resisting the United States, and consolidate its own leadership position. However, this plan was opposed by Britain and France as soon as it was revealed.
　　The struggle in the economic field between imperialism is increasingly characterized by the re-division of spheres of influence and colonies. The United States and West Germany, which have no colonies, are pointing their expansion spears at the overseas spheres of influence of Britain and France. U.S. capital and U.S. goods are aggressively breaking into Britain's traditional market. Before the war, Britain's exports to the sterling area were 2.3 times larger than the U.S., now only 1.4 times larger. In 1950, Britain's investment in the Commonwealth (including Canada) was still 20% larger than the U.S., but now the U.S. has reversed and is 10% larger than Britain. West Germany is also seizing British positions. Britain has long been overwhelmed by West Germany in the Western European market. In many countries in the Middle East, West Germany has taken the place of Britain and ranked first and second. From 1950 to 1958, West Germany's commodity exports to Commonwealth countries increased by an average of eight times, including ten times to India and Canada. In addition, West Germany's loans to India have reached more than 900 million marks, and it will also provide a loan of 2.5 billion rupees for India's "Third Five-Year Plan." France used to have strict control over its sphere of influence, making it difficult for U.S. and West German capital to enter. However, recently, because French monopoly groups are eager to "develop" African resources and need funds, and African colonies are moving toward independence one after another, the United States and West Germany have taken the opportunity to expand their economic influence. Recently, the United States used the United Nations banner to interfere in the Congo, indicating that the United States may use the same method to squeeze out the colonial interests of Britain, especially France, in Africa. All of these cannot but arouse the fear of Britain and France, and actively seek countermeasures. For example, Britain is trying to expand capital exports to consolidate its overseas investment positions. In recent years, France's capital exports have also reached 900 million U.S. dollars annually.
　　The contradictions within the imperialist group are unfolding on this profound economic basis. This profound economic root determines that the contradictions between them cannot be eliminated by means of compromise or negotiation. Facts have constantly proved and will continue to prove that the process of the imperialist group moving towards disintegration is accelerating.

　　帝国主义国家间矛盾的新发展
　　苏蓝
    最近以来，西欧国家之间进行了广泛的外交活动。继7月底阿登纳和戴高乐会谈以及8月初麦克米伦和阿登纳会谈之后，西欧各国政府之间又举行了许多次政府首脑或外长级的双边会谈。据报道，这样的会谈还将要继续进行。
    这些频繁的双边会谈，是在长期以来帝国主义各国间力量对比不断改变的基础上进行的。它们有的表现为互相拉拢，有的表现为互相倾轧。尽管会谈的内容透露不多，但人们不难看出，西欧各国正在企图重新调整它们之间、它们和美国之间的关系，为进一步展开相互斗争准备新的基础。
    （一）
    几次会谈和最近一系列的事实，充分地暴露了英、法、西德之间在争夺西欧霸权问题上的深刻矛盾。据透露，在戴高乐、阿登纳以及麦克米伦、阿登纳的会谈中，都讨论过“欧洲一体化”问题，欧洲两个对立的经济集团问题，镇压与分化殖民地独立运动问题（主要是如何控制非洲问题），以及各国发展核武器问题（主要是西德国防军以核武器武装问题）。归根到底，这些问题牵涉到：谁将成为西欧的主人。
    戴高乐主张共同市场六国成立一个“欧洲邦联”，在巴黎成立常设“政治秘书处”，并成立总理理事会和外长理事会。在就重大问题作出决定后，由法国作为六国的发言人，从而建立美、英、法三国领导核心。这是法国组织“第三种力量”和争夺西欧政治领导权的又一次努力。法国一直把“共同市场”作为它登上西欧霸主地位的阶梯。在这一点上，法国深恐英国和“共同市场”接近，妨碍戴高乐争夺西欧霸权的野心。因此，法国对阿登纳—麦克米伦会谈深表不安。巴黎“世界报”就透露，戴高乐很了解，“在一个有英国参加的欧洲中，他便不能起他自认为有资格在大陆上要求起的优越作用”。目前，法国一再强调“德法和解”，尽力阻止英国打入欧洲大陆，正是最好不过地表明了法国的心情。但另一方面，西德经济实力和军事力量的不断增长，尤其是西德国防军加紧核武装的行动，也使法国深感不安。在这种情况下，在法国的资产阶级中开始或隐或现地出现了这样一种愿望，即改善同英国的关系，来共同限制西德势力的发展。孟戴斯—弗朗斯在9月6日发表的一篇文章说：“有两个国家可以激励西方必要的复兴，只消它们团结在一起。它们就是英国和法国”。事实上，在“共同市场”内部，法国和西德的关系并不是和谐的。恰恰相反，两国垄断资本的利益分歧，愈来愈加明显了。例如，随着西德工业界对哈尔斯坦计划中加速“共同市场”步伐的反对，最近法国和西德之间在农业政策上发生了公开的争吵。西德“世界报”耽心地指出，这一危机的“公开爆发”，将使“欧洲整体化”陷于“僵局”。当然，两国垄断资本在“共同市场”内的关系，还不会决裂，但十分清楚的是，随着“共同市场”的进一步发展，这个经济集团已经出现了裂痕。
    几次会谈的情况表明，英国力图打破自从“自由贸易区计划”失败之后在欧洲大陆所处的孤立处境。最近一个时期以来，英国对它的大陆盟国的政策，有时是拉法抑德，有时是拉德抑法，以便建立新的力量对比的平衡，提高英国在西欧事务中的地位。在控制西德的核武装方面，在防止西德向它们的殖民地扩张方面，英国和法国的立场是一致的。但是，英国对戴高乐独霸西欧的野心，表现了极大的不安。针对戴高乐的“政治秘书处”的主张，英国坚持自己的“欧洲关税同盟”方案，企图借此打入欧洲大陆，进而拆散“共同市场”。在西欧两个经济集团的问题上，英国同法国的立场长期以来是对立的。法国的态度，成为英国同“共同市场”达成协议的主要阻力。英国目前对西德表示“亲密”，正是利用“共同市场”内部矛盾，力图改变自己被孤立地位的新尝试。英国对法国成为“原子俱乐部”成员的要求也一直采取模棱两可的态度，不予支持。
    这是英国政策的一个方面。由于对社会主义国家的阶级仇恨，并为了打破法国和西德联合对付英国的局面，英国政策的另一方面是：支持西德军国主义的重新武装，支持西德在德国问题和西柏林问题上的冷战立场。最近，英国国防大臣沃金森和西德国防部长施特劳斯磋商，准备两国合制导弹武器，使两国在军事上进一步勾结。据透露，在麦克米伦—阿登纳会谈中，英国支持西德在西柏林问题上的“不妥协态度”，换取英国在西欧经济中的“有利地位”。然而，英国对西德军事力量的膨胀是十分不安的。对于美国要以“北极星”导弹武装西德，把西德当作北大西洋集团的核心力量，英国是坚决反对的，因为它同英国夺取西欧霸权的利益相冲突。英国所希望的是：西德的重新武装在英国允许的范围内进行，在英国可以控制的范围内进行——当然，这种愿望是要落空的。
    法国的“政治秘书处”计划和英国的“欧洲关税同盟”方案，又同西德的主张大相径庭。西德强调“整体化”，主张把“共同市场”、“煤钢联营”和“原子联营”合并为统一组织，成立一个超国家的权力机构。而在这个机构中，西德凭借自己的经济实力，成为事实上的“盟主”。西德的主张充分反映了西德垄断资本要求掌握西欧领导权的野心，同时又在一定程度上反映了美国对西欧问题的意见。人所共知，由于美帝国主义的积极扶植西德，在波恩政府同法国、英国会谈时，阿登纳常常成为美国在西欧的代言人。
    西德目前由于在政治上和军事上受着国际条约的某些约束，还处于二等国的地位。这同它在经济上的头等大国地位远不相称。西德竭力想冲破这些限制，推翻西欧目前的均势。波恩政府除了在经济上继续扩张自己的势力，在政治上提高自己的地位以外，力图加强自己的军事力量。西德急于获得美国的“北极星”导弹，并力求拥有自己制造的核武器。就在麦克米伦到达波恩的同一天，西德政府发表的公报提出要使西德海军成为一支能发射核子武器的现代化部队。英国“每日快报”也透露，在英国、西德会谈时，“满怀忧虑的阿登纳力陈他坚持必须加强欧洲防务的种种理由”。西德很清楚，它的狂热的扩军活动，特别是努力获取核武器的活动，不会不引起英法的疑惧。为此，西德正在谨慎地利用英法之间的矛盾。西德一方面强调巴黎—波恩轴心的重要性，并以自己的经济力量支持法国的核军备计划，迫使法国在生产核武器上同它合作，并以答应在阿尔及利亚问题上支持戴高乐来换取法国代表西德在德国问题和西柏林问题上发言，并竭力防止英法重新结成防德联盟，另一方面，波恩对戴高乐企图建立“三巨头”领导的作法，表示了公开不满，并在一定程度上同英国“改善关系”。西德“世界报”曾意味深长地说：“现在要作的是弥补过去耽误了的东西。除了保持法德友谊外，不能影响同英国的联系，而是平等地建立它。”西德同英国的“接近”，表明波恩政府不愿意被“共同市场”束缚住自己的手脚，妨碍它开拓更广泛的市场，因而在“六国”、“七国”之间企图扮演“调停者”的角色。“泰晤士报”在评英国、西德会谈时说：阿登纳表示愿意设法使英联邦对‘共同市场’的免税入口制继续下去；这一报道，为西德在西欧经济问题上的政策作了有力的注解。值得注意的是，西德不仅想吸收英国加入“共同市场”以有利于自己的经济扩张，同时阻止戴高乐夺取西欧政治霸权的计划，并且正打算以此为饵，诱使英国支持它的核武装计划。
    从以上这种相互勾结又彼此倾轧的关系中可以看出，随着法国为提高自己的国际地位的努力，随着英国企图改变它在西欧被孤立的局面而积极展开活动，随着西德经济和政治力量的不断发展，西欧国家之间的矛盾不是缓和了，而是继续加深了。会谈也好，其他的外交活动也好，只不过表明它们想在某一时期或某一问题上拉拢一方，以打击另一方。因而，这不仅不会意味着它们之间的斗争的和缓，恰恰相反，这只能意味着新的、更激烈的斗争正在酝酿中。
    （二）
    从西方报刊的评论中可以看出，西欧国家加紧互相之间纵横捭阖的活动，除了争夺西欧霸权以外，同时也想趁美国在西欧的影响下降之际，通过重新组合西欧各国的力量来加强西欧国家在西方阵营中的地位和发言权。阿登纳—戴高乐会谈和麦克米伦—阿登纳会谈，都说明了西欧国家——首先是英国和法国对美国的离心倾向有了进一步的发展。
    西欧国家对美国离心倾向的增长是在这样的情况下发生：最近以来，亚、非、拉丁美洲民族独立运动有了新的高涨，世界和平运动有了进一步的发展。而在四国首脑会议被美国破坏以后，美帝国主义的和平假面具在全世界人民面前又被彻底暴露。这样，便使得美国在帝国主义集团内的威信空前下降，它在资本主义世界中的领导地位发生了新的动摇。西欧国家企图趁美国地位大为削弱的时机，抬高它们在国际事务中的身份。路透社就曾直言不讳：自从四国首脑会议失败以后，世界力量发生了不利于美国的改变，因此，会谈主要是“尽可能地对付和抵消”北大西洋公约组织中的弱点和
  “美国对西方领导中的弱点”。此外，美国目前正忙于国内大选，无暇多顾西欧的事务，西欧国家也认为这是迫使美国退却的大好时机。
    法国、西德会谈和英国、西德会谈，无疑地都牵涉到西欧国家同美国的关系问题。西德“总汇报”在评论英国、西德会谈时就指出：
  “欧洲未来在世界政治中作用是波恩会谈的重要题目。”在会谈前后，西方报纸又纷纷透露，西欧国家主张加强“政治协商”，不仅仅为了向美国“要求更大的发言权”和“增加西欧在北大西洋的分量”，而且希图逐渐摆脱美国对西欧的控制。英国“星期日泰晤士报”公开宣扬应由英、法、西德“领导”西欧。英国路透社记者厄尔早在宣布麦克米伦和阿登纳将要举行会谈时就写道，在目前期间，由于“美国在国外影响缩小”，“许多国家对欧洲（西欧）一体化问题正在采取一种新的看法”。英国“经济学家”杂志公开对美国表示不满说“北大西洋公约组织作为一个军事同盟几乎是不存在的，倒不如说是五角大楼控制政策的掩护。”法国“战斗报”则鼓吹“……为了防止美国出现的孤立主义，或者为了不把西方领导权让给美国，为了终于使非洲包括在西方势力范围之内，必须建立一个政治的欧洲。”戴高乐在这两次会谈前后，特别是在9月5日记者招待会上的讲话，一再强调他的修改北大西洋公约的主张。在刚果问题上，他还要求“建立负责西方战略的三大国指导机构”，这实质上是要限制美国在非洲的扩张，并削弱美国在西欧的地位。
    美国和西欧国家之间的斗争，实质上是长期以来控制与反控制的斗争。法国一直在抗拒美国的军事控制，对于北大西洋集团的所谓“一体化”计划，戴高乐曾表示坚决反对。法国拒绝美国在法设立导弹基地，拒绝把法国战术空军合并到大西洋指挥系统中去，甚至要收回它在地中海的海军指挥权。英国则一面利用“英美联盟”的关系来争夺西欧霸权，一面又利用它在资本主义世界中举足轻重的地位，同美国进行讨价还价的斗争。在政治上，英国凡是遇到美国侵略政策遭受挫败的时候，总是宣扬美国无能。特别是在美国破坏四国首脑会议之后，英国报纸不放过任何一个美国在外交上的狼狈处境，极力奚落美国，并要求美英共同领导西方。在军事上，英国不顾美国的反对，坚持要有“独立的威慑力量”，要由自己制造一部分导弹和核弹头。对于美国一手控制北大西洋集团的做法，英国也表示不满。就在麦克米伦刚刚从波恩回去不久，英国报界即掀起了一个倒北大西洋集团“盟军”总司令、美国将军诺斯塔德的运动。路透社有意地放出这样的空气：在北大西洋集团中的“一些国家代表团官员”中流传着这样一种看法：“在欧洲盟军最高司令部，美国人担任的重要职务太多了，如果说不是担任全部重要职务的话”。“每日电讯报”也叫喊“现在是有人对目前保卫西欧计划所包含的战略思想采取新的看法的时候了”。在经济上，英国则对美国支持“共同市场”的作法表示公开不满。
    当然，对于西欧国家的这种“反叛”行为，美国是不会漠然视之的。最近以来，华盛顿在加强对西欧的控制上，花了不少心机。早在去年10月，美国参议院公布的关于对西欧政策的报告和艾奇逊在西德发表的关于北大西洋集团“十年计划”，都强调美国对西欧的“集中领导”和“直接领导”。显然，美国的目的除了确保它在北大西洋集团中的盟主地位，防止西欧的“分庭抗礼”以外，还在于降低“美英联盟”的作用，不让英国在西方联盟中享有“优惠”地位。美国国务卿赫脱最近更特别声明，美国政府在大选期间是能够采取外交上重大行动的。“纽约先驱论坛报”在评论英国、西德会谈时也提醒人们不要忘记：“北大西洋公约组织是提供‘西方力量的基本因素’，而北大西洋公约组织的力量依靠美国。”9月6日，美国务院发言人怀特又就戴高乐讲话发表谈话，声言美国对大西洋集团的观点不变，重申北大西洋集团的“十年计划”。可以想见，美国今后将更多地利用北大西洋公约组织，通过一系列的“一体化”计划，加强美国的领导地位。例如，在军事上，降低英法地位，抬高西德，并用所谓“多国原子机构”一类的名目，来限制英国和法国的“独立核威慑力量”；在政治上，使北大西洋集团在名义上有“更大的决策权”，大小成员国都以“平等伙伴”地位参与决策，抵制英法的“独立外交”和“大国领导原则”；在经济上，也要直接掌握西欧经济事务的领导权，改组英国控制下的“欧洲经济合作局”，企图把它变成一种所谓“大西洋经济共同体”，使美国和加拿大参加进去。因此，美国今后在西欧的主要政策将是：分别驾驭英法，继续扶植西德，把西德作为北大西洋集团的骨干，作为西欧“一体化”的旗手。而美国这一政策实施的结果，将不是缓和，而是加剧了西欧国家间的矛盾，并使美国控制西欧的斗争同西欧各国间争霸的斗争交织在一起，使情况更加复杂化了。
    （三）
    帝国主义集团内部这种错综复杂的矛盾，归根结底，反映了各国垄断集团间在经济领域内无法调和的利害冲突。社会主义市场的形成和发展，使资本主义市场大大缩小，资本主义生产与消费间矛盾的进一步加剧，经济危机频繁，周期缩短。这不能不促使帝国主义争夺市场和势力范围的斗争日益尖锐，并加速了各国之间力量的消长变化。
  美国在帝国主义集团中统治地位的削弱，西欧国家离心倾向的发展，以及英、法、西德之间的角逐，正是资本主义国家经济力量消长变化的必然结果。在经过1957年—1958年的资本主义经济危机之后，美国在国外市场上的竞争能力处于战后最低落时期。两年来，美国出口在资本主义世界中的比重，由23.3％下降到21.3％。在1959年，美国对西欧的贸易出现了战后第一次入超。美国的国际收支赤字两年共达七十一亿美元，黄金、美元外流共达三十三亿美元。黄金储备价值现在已下降到一百九十亿美元以下，为二十年来的最低点，而同时长期依赖于美国的西欧国家，经济实力却有了加强。西德和法国的对外贸易比重，两年来都有了显著增长。资本主义统一市场分裂为三的局面，使美国对西欧的控制更加困难了。“共同市场”和“小自由贸易区”两个经济集团的对立，双方高筑关税壁垒的贸易战，势必影响到美国对西欧的贸易。而且，经济上的分裂，又必然加深北大西洋集团内部政治上的分裂。这同样不利于美国领导地位的巩固。但是，美国又害怕“六国”和“七国”集团联合起来组成一个排他性的欧洲经济集团，这不仅使美国无法利用矛盾，并有西欧联合起来共同对付美国的危险。美国的态度一向是，利用“六国”、“七国”纷争之际，插足西欧经济事务，加强对西欧的经济控制。美国主张组织一个“六国”、“七国”、美国和加拿大的“北大西洋共同体”，这样，既可以防止西欧对美国的排挤和抵制，又可巩固自己的领导地位。但是，这个计划刚一露头，就遭到了英法的反对。
    帝国主义之间经济领域的斗争，愈来愈带有重新瓜分势力范围和殖民地的性质。美国和没有殖民地的西德，正在把它们的扩张矛头指向英法在海外的势力范围。美国资本和美国商品，咄咄逼人地闯进了英国的传统市场。战前，英国对英镑区的出口比美国大二点三倍，现在只大一点四倍。1950年，英国对英联邦（包括加拿大）的投资还比美国大20％，现在美国已反转来比英国大10％。西德也在夺取英国的阵地。英国在西欧市场上早被西德所压倒。在中东不少国家，西德已取英而占第一、二位。自1950年到1958年，西德对英联邦国家的商品输出平均增加了八倍，其中对印度和加拿大增长了十倍。除此之外，西德给印度的贷款已达九亿多马克，并还将对印度的“第三个五年计划”给予二十五亿卢比的贷款。法国过去对自己的势力范围地区控制很严，使美国和西德资本难于打入。但是，近来由于法国垄断集团急于“开发”非洲资源，需要资金，非洲殖民地又纷纷走向独立，美国和西德就趁机扩张自己的经济势力。最近，美国利用联合国旗帜干涉刚果，预示着美国可能以同样的方式来排挤英国特别是法国在非洲的殖民利益。所有这些，不能不引起英法两国的恐惧，并积极谋取对策，例如英国竭力扩大资本输出，以巩固其海外投资阵地，法国近年来资本输出每年亦高达九亿美元。
    帝国主义集团内部的矛盾，就是在这种深刻的经济基础上展开的。这一深刻的经济根源，决定了它们之间的矛盾不可能以妥协或会谈的方式加以消除。事实不断证明并将继续证明：帝国主义集团走向四分五裂的过程，正在加速。
