The Qinghai Daily, August 29 editorial abstract:

This year, various regions in Qinghai Province have created many good experiences in improving leadership style and working methods while strengthening leadership at the forefront. The method of stationing in teams for office work, implemented by Party committees at all levels in Minhe County, is an important one. Stationing in teams for office work is a new development in the experience of strengthening leadership at the forefront. By implementing stationing in teams for office work, leading cadres at all levels can better utilize the combination of the general and the specific, and the combination of leadership and the masses, to make their work more in-depth, meticulous, and solid. Under the guidance of this thought, and based on the summary of experiences such as the convergence of five-level cadres in the fields and the dispatch of cadres to strengthen the leadership of backward teams, the Party committees at all levels in Minhe County, with a spirit of continuous revolution, have universally promoted the method of stationing in teams for office work.

Leading cadres, taking a group of people with them, going to a relatively fixed place for a longer period, eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses, conducting comprehensive investigations and research, and grasping all work to the end, can truly understand whether the general appeals are correct, summarize the experiences of the masses, enrich the thoughts of the leadership, and better guide overall work. This is also the working method that the Party has repeatedly taught us: from the masses, to the masses. During the summer harvest this year, leaders at all levels in Minhe County, due to the universal practice of stationing in teams for office work and going deep among the masses, were able to propose many practical and feasible measures to the county, the commune, or the team from actual struggles, strengthening the progress of the summer harvest and ensuring the quality of the summer harvest.

With the combination of leadership and the masses, there must also be a combination of the general and the specific. Under the guidance of the thought of combining points and surfaces, we must go deep. At the same time, precisely because we have gone deep into one point and implemented the combination of leadership and the masses, we can better achieve leading the whole area from a single point. Squatting at a point and running the surface seem contradictory, but they are a dialectical unity. Only by grasping the key teams can we better guide other teams. After the Party committees at all levels in Minhe County moved their offices to key teams, it did not affect overall leadership. On the contrary, because they went deep into key areas, dissected sparrows, enriched leadership experience, and improved leadership level, they led overall work better. During the summer harvest work, the Party committees at all levels in Minhe County paid special attention to using the method of grasping both ends and bringing along the middle, first stationing in backward production teams with arduous tasks, truly achieving "breaking through one point, gaining experience, and then using this experience to guide other units."

Will stationing in teams for office work affect the work of the organs? The experience of Minhe County also provides us with a correct answer to this question. After implementing stationing in teams for office work, the Party's leading organs can be more closely connected with the masses and with reality. To measure whether an organ's work is good or bad, we must see whether it truly unites the masses around it and strives to realize the Party's line and complete the Party's tasks. In the high tide of mass movements, how to make the work of the organs more based on reality is an important question. Setting up offices above will inevitably restrict some people from going deep into reality better, or because there is more superficial observation and less investigation and research, the leadership work still cannot be done more solidly. Moving the office to the forefront, having cadres station in teams for office work, implementing the combination of leadership and the masses, and solving problems practically at the grassroots level, turning passivity into initiative, would it not be more effective in changing the bureaucratic style of spending more time above and being busy with affairs all day long?

What things should be done while stationing in teams for office work? The experience of Minhe County also tells us that it is necessary to grasp ideology, grasp policies, and grasp key points; but we must never monopolize and replace the work of the production teams, but rather be good at making a fuss about the word "help," strengthening the training and improvement of grassroots cadres in many ways. Let grassroots cadres learn the leadership style and working methods of higher-level leading cadres from the beginning to the end of a stage and a task. Only when grassroots cadres truly have independent working ability, and still do a good job after the leading organs' cadres leave the team, can stationing in teams for office work take root.

The current significance of recommending stationing in teams for office work lies in directly strengthening the leadership of the production increase and economy practice movement centered on grain and steel. We believe that widely implementing the method of stationing in teams for office work, and continuously improving and perfecting this method in practical work, will certainly effectively strengthen the leadership of the grain and steel forefront, enabling Party organizations and administrative leading cadres at all levels to go deep into the grassroots level better, and use the method of combining the general and the specific, and the method of combining leadership and the masses, to carry out the production increase and economy practice movement both vigorously and solidly.

    住队办公——加强第一线的好办法
    青海日报8月29日社论摘要
    今年青海省各地在加强第一线领导当中，创造出许多改进领导作风和工作方法的好经验。民和县各级党委执行住队办公的方法，就是其中重要的一个。住队办公是加强第一线领导经验的新发展。实行住队办公以后，各级领导干部可以更好地运用一般和个别相结合，领导和群众相结合的方法，把工作做得更加深入、细致和扎实。民和县各级党委在这一思想指导下，在总结了五级干部会师到田、下放干部加强后进队领导等经验的基础上，以不断革命的精神，普遍推行了住队办公的方法。
    领导干部带上一班人马，以较长时间，深入到比较固定的地方，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，进行全面的调查研究，把各项工作一抓到底，就可以真正了解一般号召是否正确，并且总结群众经验，丰富领导思想，更好地指导全面工作。这也就是党一再教导我们的从群众中来，到群众中去的工作方法。民和县各级领导在今年夏收中间，由于普遍住队办公，深入到群众中间去，所以才能从实际斗争中，向全县、全社或者是全队提出许多切实可行的措施，加强了夏收进度，保证了夏收质量。
    有了领导和群众相结合，还必须有一般和个别相结合。我们要在点面结合的思想指导下，深入下去，同时，正因为我们深入一点，实行了领导和群众相结合，所以才能更好地做到以点带面。蹲点与跑面看起来有矛盾，实则是辩证的统一，只有抓住了重点队，才能更好地指导其他队。民和县各级党委搬到重点队办公以后，并没有影响全面领导，相反，倒是因为深入重点，解剖麻雀，丰富领导经验，提高领导水平，才把全面工作领导得更好。民和县各级党委在夏收工作中间，特别注意运用抓两头、带中间的方法，首先住到后进而且任务艰巨的生产队去，真正做到了“突破一点，取得经验，然后利用这种经验去指导其他单位”。
    住队办公会不会影响机关工作，民和县的经验也为我们正确地解答了这个问题。他们实行住队办公以后，使党的领导机关更能密切联系群众，联系实际。我们衡量一个机关工作的好坏，要看是否真正把群众团结在周围，为实现党的路线，完成党的任务而奋斗。在群众运动的高潮中间，怎样使机关工作更加立足于实际，乃是个重要的问题。办公室设在上面，总不免要牵制到一些人不能更好地深入实际，或者是由于走马观花多，调查研究少，仍然不能把领导工作做得更扎实。办公室搬到第一线，干部住队办公，实行领导与群众相结合，脚踏实地地在下面解决问题，变被动为主动，岂不更有效地改变了在上面的时间多、整天忙于事务的官僚主义作风吗？
    住队办公做些什么事情？民和县的经验也告诉我们，要抓思想，抓政策，抓关键；但是决不能包办代替生产队的工作，而是要善于在“帮”字上做文章，从多方面加强对基层干部的培养和提高。让基层干部从一个阶段和一项工作的始末，来学习上级领导干部的领导作风和工作方法。只有使基层干部真正具有独立的工作能力，当领导机关干部离队以后，仍然把工作搞得很好，才能使住队办公扎下了根。
    当前推荐住队办公的意义，在于直接加强以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动的领导。我们相信，广泛执行住队办公的方法，并且在实际工作中不断地改进和完善这种方法，就一定能有效地加强粮、钢第一线领导，使各级党组织和行政领导干部更好地深入基层，用一般和个别相结合、领导与群众相结合的方法，把增产节约运动开展得既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实。
