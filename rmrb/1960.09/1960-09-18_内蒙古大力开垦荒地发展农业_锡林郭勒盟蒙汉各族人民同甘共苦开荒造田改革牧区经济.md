Inner Mongolia Vigorously Reclaims Wasteland to Develop Agriculture
    People of All Nationalities, Mongolians and Hans, in Xilin Gol League Share Hardships to Reclaim Land and Reform the Pastoral Economy

    (Our newspaper’s dispatch from Hohhot, September 17th) The entire party and all the people in Inner Mongolia are vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, having already exceeded the annual plan for wasteland reclamation. This year marks the year with the most wasteland reclamation since the liberation of Inner Mongolia. Currently, wasteland reclamation is still ongoing in various regions, actively creating conditions for expanding cultivated land next year.
    While carrying out large-scale wasteland reclamation, the autonomous region is also seizing the time to rush planting. 80% of the newly reclaimed land has been sown with grain, with a significant increase in the four high-yield crops of rice, sorghum, corn, and potatoes compared to last year. Currently, various regions are concentrating their main labor force to strengthen field management, carrying out a production increase competition centered on weeding and eliminating wasteland, adding water and topdressing fertilizer, in order to promote the early maturity, early harvest, and increased yield of various crops.
    This year, various regions of the autonomous region have implemented the effective measures of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee's instruction: "Wasteland reclamation should proceed on two fronts, with mechanized reclamation and animal-powered reclamation, state-owned farms and mass reclamation carried out simultaneously." Therefore, from the very beginning of reclamation, there has been a situation where the entire party and all the people are involved, with all walks of life providing support. During the intense period of reclamation, there were 150,000 commune members, over 150 state-owned farms and joint state-private farms, and thousands of tractors involved in the battle. They set up tents on the wasteland, organized two teams, and adopted the method of "men and horses resting, machines not resting," reclaiming while planting. People of all ethnic groups also engaged in large-scale collaboration, breaking down the boundaries between banners and counties, agricultural areas and pastoral areas, with Mongolians and Hans, farmers and herdsmen, jointly forming reclamation armies. Under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, they reclaimed wasteland in a planned manner. In addition, local government offices, factories, and schools also vigorously supported wasteland reclamation. The Hulunbuir League transportation department repaired roads in advance for the reclamation teams; factories built farm implement repair factories specifically to repair and equip farm implements for the reclamation army; commercial departments promptly transported the seeds, oil, tents, reed mats, rubber shoes, and other commodities needed by the reclamation teams to the wasteland, supporting the smooth progress of reclamation.
    In the wasteland reclamation movement, various regions of the autonomous region also paid attention to closely combining the development of agriculture with the development of animal husbandry. The Xilin Gol League and the Hulunbuir League, which have a larger scale of wasteland reclamation in pastoral areas, have planted a large amount of feed and forage grass in addition to a large number of agricultural crops, mainly grain, on the newly reclaimed more than four million mu of wasteland.

    (Our newspaper’s dispatch from Hohhot, September 17th) Xilin Gol League, the largest livestock area in Inner Mongolia, has seen people of all ethnic groups engaged in large-scale wasteland reclamation and farming on the grasslands, creating favorable conditions for the realization of pastoral economic reform—the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry. Now each herdsman in the league has an average of twelve mu of cultivated land. The newly reclaimed land has been planted with various grains and feed crops, with seedlings growing vigorously. Mongolian and Han farmers and herdsmen are strengthening the later-stage management of these crops.
    Xilin Gol League is located in the central grassland of Inner Mongolia, covering an area of 140,000 square kilometers. Although there are tens of millions of mu of arable land, it did not produce grain before liberation. After liberation, with the establishment of state-owned farms and the development of the animal husbandry cooperative movement, agriculture began to develop here. After the people's communes were established in 1958, agriculture experienced new development. However, the increase in grain and feed still could not keep up with the growth of the pastoral population and the needs of industrial and animal husbandry development. After the beginning of spring this year, the Party organizations at all levels and the vast number of herdsmen in the league, encouraged by the principle of "agriculture is the foundation," resolved to reclaim wasteland and cultivate land. Various localities adopted methods of state-owned farms, people's communes, and production teams running agriculture, and vigorously developed agriculture according to local conditions. More than 30,000 Mongolian herdsmen headed towards the wasteland for the realization of "prosperous livestock and bumper crops" on the grasslands, working shoulder to shoulder with Han farmers who came to support wasteland reclamation in pastoral areas, learning and working together.
    In the great struggle to transform nature, a new atmosphere of "herdsmen leading cattle, farmers holding plows, sharing hardships, and building pastoral areas" has emerged everywhere on the newly reclaimed land. On the newly reclaimed land, Mongolians and Hans also jointly built a large number of houses and livestock pens, and dug many wells, accelerating the construction of settled residential areas in pastoral areas. People's communes in neighboring counties have also broken down boundaries, supporting herdsmen with manpower, materials, tools, and seeds. (Attached picture)

    内蒙古大力开垦荒地发展农业
    锡林郭勒盟蒙汉各族人民同甘共苦开荒造田改革牧区经济
    本报呼和浩特17日电　内蒙古全党全民大办农业，大办粮食，全年开荒造田计划已超额完成。今年，是内蒙古解放以来开荒最多的一年。目前，各地开荒仍在继续进行，为明年扩大耕地面积积极创造条件。
    自治区在大规模开荒的同时，又抓紧时间抢种。新垦荒地的80％播种了粮食，其中水稻、高粱、玉米、马铃薯等四种高产作物比去年大大增加。现在各地正集中主要劳力加强田间管理，开展以除草灭荒、加水追肥为中心的增产竞赛，力促各种农作物早熟、早收、多收。
    今年，自治区各地贯彻执行了内蒙古党委指示：“开荒要两条腿走路，机械开荒与畜力开荒、国营农牧场开垦与群众性开荒同时并举”的有效措施，因此开荒从一开始就出现全党全民动手，各行各业支援的局面。在开荒紧张时，全区有十五万公社社员，一百五十多个国营农牧场和公私合营牧场的几千台拖拉机投入战斗。他们在荒原上搭起帐篷，组织两套人马，采取歇人歇马不歇机具的办法，边开边种。各族人民还大搞协作，打破旗与县、农区与牧区的界限，蒙古族和汉族、农民和牧民联合组成开荒大军，在党委统一领导下，有计划地开垦荒地。此外，各地机关、工厂、学校也都大力支援开荒。呼伦贝尔盟交通部门事先为开荒队伍修好道路；各工厂建起农具修配厂，专门为开荒大军修配农具；商业部门及时把开荒队伍所需要的籽种、油料、帐篷、苇席、胶鞋等商品源源不断运往荒地，支援了开荒的顺利进行。
    自治区各地在开荒运动中，还注意了把发展农业与发展牧业紧密结合起来。牧区开荒规模较大的锡林郭勒盟和呼伦贝尔盟，在新垦的四百万多亩荒地上，除种植了大量以粮食为主的农作物外，还种植了大量的饲料和饲草。
    本报呼和浩特17日电　内蒙古最大的畜牧区——锡林郭勒盟，各族人民在草原上大规模开荒种地，为实现牧区经济改革——农牧结合创造了有利条件。现在全盟每个牧民平均有耕地十二亩。新开的荒地已经种上了各种粮食、饲料作物，禾苗生长茁壮，蒙汉族农牧民正在加强这些庄稼的后期管理。
    锡林郭勒盟位于内蒙古中部大草原，面积十四万平方公里。虽有数千万亩可耕土地，但解放前不产粮食。解放后随着国营农牧场的建立，和畜牧业合作运动的发展，这里开始发展农业。1958年人民公社化后，农业又有新的发展。但是，粮食和饲料的增长，仍然跟不上牧区人口的增长和工业、牧业发展的需要。今年入春后，全盟各级党组织和广大牧民，在“农业是基础”这一方针的鼓舞下，决心开荒造田。各地因地制宜采取国营农牧场、人民公社、生产队办农业的办法，大办农业。全盟有三万多蒙古族牧民，为草原实现“六畜兴旺，五谷丰登”奔向荒原，和前来支援牧区开荒的汉族农民，肩并着肩，边学边干。
    在改造自然的伟大斗争中，新垦地上到处出现了“牧民牵牛，农民扶犁，同甘共苦，建设牧区”的新气象。在新垦地上，蒙汉人民还共同建筑了大量房屋、牲畜圈棚，打了许多水井，加快了牧区定居地的建设。邻近县的各人民公社，还打破界限，以人力、物力、工具、种子支援牧民。（附图片）
