Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 20th: The Vietnam-China Friendship Association Delegation concluded its visit to Guangzhou and left Guangzhou for Nanning on the 19th.

On the evening of the 18th, Chen Yu, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Guangdong Province, held a banquet to warmly bid farewell to all members of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association Delegation.

Governor Chen Yu spoke at the banquet. He said, "We are delighted to see that for fifteen years, the heroic Vietnamese people have been advancing victoriously under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party. The victories achieved by the Vietnamese people have strengthened the strength of the entire socialist camp and inspired the colonial and semi-colonial people's will to fight for independence and freedom. Although American imperialism still controls South Vietnam, we firmly believe that the Vietnamese people's desire to reunify their motherland cannot be stopped by any force and will surely be victorious." Chen Yu said, "The people of China and Vietnam have forged a fighting friendship in the long struggle against common enemies. This brotherly friendship, built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, will be increasingly consolidated and developed."

Tran Huy Lieu, in his speech, reviewed the traditional friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China and expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people and the people of Guangdong for their assistance to the Vietnamese people. He concluded by saying, "Although imperialism is constantly slandering us, no force can stop us from advancing towards the road of socialism and communism. We firmly believe that your struggle to liberate Taiwan and our struggle to reunify our motherland will surely be victorious."

On the afternoon of the 18th, Chen Yu, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Guangdong Province, and Zhu Guang, Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Guangzhou, met with all members of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association Delegation and had cordial talks.

The Vietnam-China Friendship Association Delegation arrived in Guangzhou on the 16th from Hangzhou. On the same day, Lin Qiangyun, President of the Guangdong Branch of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association, hosted a luncheon to entertain the distinguished guests. The Guangdong Branch of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association held a grand get-together that evening to warmly welcome the delegation. Vietnamese students and interns in Guangzhou were invited to attend the party.

During its stay in Guangzhou, the Vietnam-China Friendship Association Delegation paid homage to the Guangzhou Commune Uprising Martyrs' Cemetery and the tomb of Vietnamese martyr Pham Hong Thai, and laid wreaths in front of the tombs. The delegation also visited the former site of the "Peasant Movement Training Institute" sponsored by Chairman Mao and visited units such as the Zhujiang Film Studio and the Huadong People's Commune in Hua County.

When the Vietnam-China Friendship Association Delegation left Guangzhou, Lin Qiangyun, Deputy Governor of Guangdong Province and President of the Guangdong Branch of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association, and Zhang Ruiquan, Deputy Mayor of Guangzhou, and others warmly saw them off at the station.
