　　Trip to Miike
　　By Japanese writer Nishino Tatsukichi
　　I visited the Miike Coal Mine in July of this year. Located in Omuta City, Kyushu, the Miike Coal Mine has now become world-renowned. This is not because it is the largest coal mine in Japan, but because the unprecedentedly massive and heroic struggle of the miners against the capitalists' unjustified dismissals, which lasted for more than a year and a half, wrote a brilliant page in the history of the Japanese workers' movement. The indomitable fighting spirit of the Miike Coal Mine workers has won the sympathy and support of the working class in various countries.
　　I stayed at the Miike Coal Mine for only six days, but from my contact with some Miike people, it is not difficult to appreciate why the Miike miners' fighting spirit is so tenacious and how their strike could last so long. Here, I want to focus on some old miners, housewives of mining families, and children I came into contact with. From these people, we can see the great impact of the Miike Coal Mine workers' struggle on the people of Miike.

        The History of Blood and Tears of Old Miners
　　Those familiar with the history of Omuta know that the city's development history is a history of the Mitsui Zaibatsu's exploitation of workers' blood and sweat to get rich. The predecessor of the Mitsui Zaibatsu, "Mitsui Group," bought the Miike Coal Mine, which at that time relied on prisoners for coal mining, from the Japanese government at a low price in 1889. The Miike Coal Mine became a "cash cow" for the Mitsui Zaibatsu. The Mitsui Zaibatsu built factories such as "Mitsui Chemical," "Toyo High Pressure," "Miike Synthetic," and "Mitsui Metal Refining Plant" around the Miike Coal Mine, and surrounded them with coal mine conveyor belts and dedicated railways, making Omuta a large industrial city.
　　The Mitsui Zaibatsu built its capital palace on the bones of the Miike Coal Mine workers. On a high ground next to the Osuna employee dormitory of the Miike Coal Mine Miyoura Mine, there is still a three-meter-high monument, which reads "Established by the officials of the Miike Shūjikan (Prison) in August of Meiji 21 (1888)." This monument was erected for the workers who sacrificed their lives at the Miike Coal Mine. An old miner named Imoto Hatsuzo talked to me about this monument and described his experience of being cruelly exploited by capitalists in the coal mine.
　　Old man Imoto has been working as a miner since 1917 and is now retired at home. His family is a family of miners spanning three generations. His father, Imoto Tsunehei, is eighty-three years old this year and also worked as a miner. His old wife also worked in the coal mine for seven years. Now, his eldest son, Imoto Hiroshi, is also a coal miner and a central committee member of the Miike Coal Mine Union, and an active member of the workers' movement.
　　Old man Imoto painfully recalled the tragic fact that countless people were buried in the coal mine and countless people were robbed of their jobs and driven out of the mine when he was working in the coal mine. When the Osuna employee dormitory was built, many bones were unearthed. Even now, the housewives of Miike still commemorate these dead souls twice a year. Whenever their husbands go to work, the housewives are always worried, saying, "I hope everything goes well!"
　　Another old miner, Tsuboko, who lives next door to the Imoto family, also told me about his own painful experience. Once, he almost fell into a collapsing coal mine, and hurried out, leaving a coal car there. The capitalist's lackeys were furious when they saw this situation, and said to him, "Even if you work for twenty-five years, you are only worth seven hundred and fifty yuan (those who work continuously for twenty-five years can receive seven hundred and fifty yuan in retirement money). But, a coal car is worth eight hundred yuan!" Tsuboko retorted angrily at the time that a person's life cannot be bought with one thousand or two thousand yuan. Because he said such a sentence, he was beaten up. Even today, old man Tsuboko is still very indignant when he mentions this matter. After Imoto Hatsuzo and Tsuboko retired in their old age, the capitalists forced them to work two hours a day to level the ground. On the ground they leveled, the Mitsui Zaibatsu built the "Toyo High Pressure" factory.
　　After Japan's defeat in 1945, they thought they had finally seen the light. However, the lives of the miners were still not easy after the war. The coal mine owners repeatedly drastically reduced the number of workers, causing many workers to be left on the streets, struggling on the brink of starvation. Omuta has the second largest number of unemployed workers among Japanese cities. In the post-war era when Japanese and American monopoly capital strengthened their collusion, the capitalists also learned a new blood-sucking system from the United States. In order to cope with the so-called "power revolution," Japanese coal industry capitalists prepared to lay off 100,000 workers in the next three years. The Miike Coal Mine alone would lay off one or two thousand people at a time. The old miners, looking at the past and looking at the present, realized that only struggle can defend the workers' right to survival. In the fiery struggle in Miike, some old miners, despite their old age and weakness, actively plunged into the torrent of struggle.

          The Housewives of Miike
　　The housewives of Miike Coal Mine workers' families are a powerful force supporting the miners' struggle. They not only bear the heavy burden of housework, but also actively participate in the struggle. Although the struggle is long-term and arduous, they are full of vitality and optimism. The expressions on their faces are so bright, and their fighting spirit is so high, that they give the Miike miners unlimited encouragement. Whether in workers' residences or on the streets, you can see their combat posture. They wear headscarves with the words "Miike Union" on them, and under those headscarves, there is a pair of gentle but deep and firm eyes shining. The struggle has been prolonged, their husbands have been injured in the struggle, and the donations received from the union to support the strike are not much, and life is very hard. However, they never complain. They are deeply moved by the workers from all over the country and people from all walks of life who risk their lives to support the struggle of the Miike Coal Mine workers. They recognize the truth that unity is strength. They said: "Struggle cannot be done by one person's strength."
　　The housewives of the Miike Coal Mine shoulder many heavy tasks in the struggle, so that they cannot but carry out intense activities day and night. A sixth-grade elementary school student wrote a short poem describing his mother's hard work: "Late at night, Mom is busy washing clothes." Yes, where do they have time to take care of these things during the day? Many housewives are busy making meals for the worker pickets during the day, delivering meals. In a makeshift, simple dining hall, they endure the heat, overcome difficulties, and try their best to ensure that the worker pickets eat enough and eat well.
　　The housewives of workers' families not only provide "logistics" services, but also go to the front line of the struggle. In this way, they also became the targets of police suppression. Once, a housewife surnamed Gao was shot in the shoulder by the police. The police also arrested a group of housewives who actively participated in the struggle. However, they were not afraid at all, and stood up to carry out the anti-suppression struggle. With the strong support of the workers, they protested against the persecution of the police and won the victory of the anti-persecution struggle in various ways. The heroic behavior of the Miike housewives has set a shining example for women all over Japan. Indeed, from the women of Miike, people can see the future and hope of Japanese women today.

        The Descendants of Miners are Growing Up
　　Harsh life tortures the next generation of the Japanese working class, but it also tempers them, allowing them to grow up in struggle. The children of the Miike Coal Mine workers are growing up in the struggle and constantly accepting the baptism of struggle. On July 23 this year, when 154 workers sent by the Hokkaido Coal Mine Union to support the struggle were about to leave, a fourth-grade elementary school student named Saeki Machiko went to Omuta Station with her mother to see them off. The child's father is a coal miner, and her mother is an active member of the coal mine women's association. In 1953, the Miike Coal Mine workers carried out a 113-day struggle against the capitalist enterprise's "rationalization." Machiko's father and mother participated in demonstrations and went to the mountain club where the mining office was located to hold a three-day and three-night sit-in. Machiko was only three years old that year. She also went with her parents. She fell asleep in the demonstration parade at night. It was October, and it was very cold at night. Someone came up with the idea of covering her with several red flags to keep her warm.
　　Now, Machiko has grown up, and she can take care of the house like her older brothers and sisters who are in middle school. Now, her father is one of the miners who refused to be dismissed by the capitalists, and her mother is the head of the "Housewives' Association." They are both very busy and cannot take care of their children's studies. However, the children of the Saeki family are willing to work hard and study diligently.
　　The children of the Miike miners spontaneously carried out various activities to support the miners' struggle. High school students organized groups by region; junior high and elementary school students also organized groups. For example, the "Coal Miners' Children's Group" in the Shinko employee dormitory area near the port office is organized by students in the sixth grade of elementary school and above. They organize to clean the roads, review their homework, tutor younger students, and also carry out communication activities to tell the children all over the country about the struggle of the Miike Coal Mine workers. There is also a "Friendship Group" in the Shinko employee dormitory area. The two groups together also published a small literary magazine "Dove Flute," which has been published for three issues as of July. In this small magazine's garden, the seeds of the miners' children's hatred for the reactionaries and love for the working class are sown. A sixth-grade elementary school student who participated in the "Friendship Group" wrote a short poem satirizing the police: "The police are like wild dogs, scurrying back and forth." These verses were not learned by the children from school textbooks, but were deeply inspired by their lives. Since the police were dispatched to suppress the strike, the children of the Miike miners saw that the police were not as "civilized" as written in the textbooks. They scurried back and forth like wild dogs, attacking the children's parents and older brothers. They recognized the true face of the police, and also saw the scene of the struggle between the 16,000-member worker picket team and the 10,000 police officers. What a profound class education all of this gave them!

                ×　×　×
　　Struggle is training people and changing people. The struggle of the Miike Coal Mine workers is like a melting pot, smelting, shaping, and testing the old and new generations, men and women of Miike. This is one of the most valuable gains of the Miike Coal Mine struggle. (Attached pictures)
　　Children follow their mothers to the struggle assembly venue. Facing the cruel and arduous struggle, neither the children nor the mothers show any fear, and are full of optimism.
　　The old woman also wears the struggle symbol—a white towel—and comes to the front of the mine to encourage the miners who are persisting in the struggle.

### 三池行

　　三池行
　　日本作家　西野辰吉
    今年7月间，我到过三池煤矿访问。座落在九州大牟田市的三池煤矿，现在已变得举世闻名了。这并非因为它是日本最大的煤矿，而是因为矿工们反对资方无理解雇的气势和规模空前浩大的英勇斗争，坚持了一年半以上，在日本工人运动史上写下了辉煌的一页。三池煤矿工人不屈不挠的斗争精神赢得了各国工人阶级的同情和支持。
    我在三池煤矿逗留不过六天，但从我同一些三池人的接触中，也不难体会到三池矿工的斗志何以如此顽强、他们的罢工怎能坚持这么长久。这里，我想着重谈谈我所接触的一些老矿工、矿工家庭的主妇和孩子们，从这些人的身上可以看出三池煤矿工人斗争给予三池人的巨大影响。
        老矿工的血泪史
    熟悉大牟田历史的人，都知道这个城市的发展史就是日本三井财阀压榨工人血汗的一部发家史。三井财阀的前身“三井组”在1889年从当时的日本政府手里用廉价收买了当时靠囚犯采煤的三池煤矿。三池煤矿成了三井财阀的一个“摇钱树”。三井财阀在三池煤矿周围修建了“三井化学”、“东洋高压”、“三池合成”、“三井金属制炼所”等工厂，并且用煤矿的运煤传送带和专用铁路环绕起来，使大牟田发展成了一个大工业城市。
    三井财阀在三池煤矿工人的白骨上建立起来了它的资本的殿堂。在三池煤矿宫浦矿井大砂职工宿舍旁边的一块高地上，直到现在还竖立着一块三米高的碑，上面写着“明治二十一年8月三池集治监吏员立之”。这碑是给三池煤矿牺牲的工人们立的。一位名叫井本初藏的老矿工跟我谈起了这个碑的事情，并且叙述了他在煤矿受资本家残酷压榨的经历。
    井本老汉从1917年起就下井当了矿工，现在已经退职在家。他家是个祖孙三代的矿工之家。他的父亲井本常平今年八十三岁了，也做过矿工。他的老妻也曾经在煤井下干过七年活。现在，他的大儿子井本弘之也是煤矿工人，而且是三池煤矿工会的中央委员，是个工人运动的积极分子。
    井本老汉痛苦地回忆了他当年在煤矿做工时，不知有多少人葬身于煤井下，不知有多少人被抢走饭碗，赶出矿山的悲惨的事实。修建大砂职工宿舍的时候，就挖掘出不少的白骨。直到现在，三池的主妇们每年两度祭奠这些亡魂。每当自己的男人出工的时候，主妇们总是提心吊胆，说一句“但愿平安无事！”
    住在井本家隔壁的另一位老矿工津波古也跟我谈了他自己的惨痛遭遇。有一次他险些掉进要塌陷的煤井里，赶忙跑了出来，而把一辆煤车丢在那里了。资本家的狗腿子看到这种情形，就大发雷霆，对他说，“你们干上二十五年，一个人也不过值七百五十元（连续做二十五年工的，可以领到七百五十元退职金）。但是，一辆煤车就值八百元！”津波古当时气愤地驳斥他说，一个人的性命不是一千元、两千元能买到的。因为说了这么一句话，他还挨了一顿拳打脚踢。直到今天一提起这件事，津波古老汉都还十分愤懑不平。井本初藏和津波古这两个老矿工在年老退职后，资本家还强迫他们每天干两小时修平场地的活。就在他们修平的场地上，三井财阀修建了“东洋高压”工厂。
    1945年日本帝国主义战败后，他们以为总算盼到天亮了。但是，战后矿工的日子仍旧不好过，煤矿老板几次三番地大批裁减工人，使很多工人流落街头，在饥饿线上挣扎。大牟田失业工人之多占日本全国城市中的第二位。在日美垄断资本加强勾结的战后年代里，资本家还从美国学来了一套新的吸血制度，日本煤业资本家为了应付所谓“动力革命”，准备在最近三年内裁减十万工人。三池煤矿光一次就要裁减一两千人。老矿工想想过去看看现在，他们认识到只有斗争才能保卫住工人的生存权利。在三池的火热斗争中，一些老矿工不顾年老体弱，积极地投入了斗争的洪流。
          三池的主妇们
    三池煤矿工人家庭的主妇们，是一支支援矿工斗争的生力军。她们一面负荷着繁重的家务担子，一面积极地参加了斗争。尽管斗争是长期和艰巨的，然而她们却充满着活力和乐观主义的精神，她们脸上的表情是如此明朗，斗志是如此昂扬，她们给了三池矿工们以无限鼓舞的力量。无论是在工人住宅里或是在街道上，你都可以看到她们的战斗姿态。她们的头上包着一块有“三池工会”字样的头巾，在那头巾下闪烁着的是一双温和的但是深沉坚毅的目光。斗争长期化了，她们的丈夫在斗争中受了伤，从工会组织领到的支援罢工的捐款不多，生活很苦。但是，她们决不叫苦。全国各地的工人兄弟和各界人民冒着生命危险来支援三池煤矿工人的斗争，使她们深受感动。她们认识到团结就是力量的真理。她们说：“斗争光靠一个人的力量是不成的。”
    三池煤矿的主妇们在斗争中肩负着许多繁重的任务，以致使她们不能不夜以继日地进行着紧张的活动。一个六年级小学生写的短诗这样形容他的母亲的辛劳：“夜深人静，妈妈洗衣忙。”是啊，白天她们哪里有时间顾得上这些呢？不少主妇在白天忙着给工人纠察队做饭，送饭。她们在一个临时搭起的简陋的食堂里冒着酷热，排除困难，想尽一切办法要让工人纠察队员们吃得饱，吃得好。
    工人家庭的主妇们不仅在“后勤”服务，而且也到斗争的最前线去。就这样，她们也成了警察镇压的对象。有一次一位姓高的主妇就被警察开枪打伤了肩膀。警察还逮捕了一批积极参加斗争的主妇。但是，她们毫不畏惧，挺起胸膛来进行反镇压的斗争。在工人们的大力支持下，她们抗议警察的迫害，并以各种方式赢得了反迫害斗争的胜利。三池主妇们的英雄行为给日本全国各地的妇女树立了光辉的榜样。的确，从三池妇女的身上，人们能够看到今天日本妇女的前途和希望。
        矿工的后代在成长
    严酷的生活，折磨着日本工人阶级的下一代，但也锻炼着他们，使他们在斗争中成长起来。三池煤矿工人的孩子们，就是在斗争中成长，不断地接受着斗争的洗礼。今年7月23日，北海道煤矿工会派来支援斗争的一百五十四名工人临行时，有一个叫佐伯真知子的四年级小学生和母亲一道到大牟田车站去送行。这个孩子的爸爸是煤矿工人，妈妈是组织煤矿妇女协会的积极分子。1953年三池煤矿工人进行了一百一十三天反对资本家企业“合理化”的斗争。真知子的爸爸和妈妈参加示威游行，到矿业所所在的山上俱乐部去举行了三天三夜的静坐斗争。那年真知子才三岁。她也和爸爸妈妈一道去了，晚上她在示威游行的队伍里睡着了。当时正是十月天气，夜里很凉。不知谁出的主意，用几面红旗给她盖在身上，让她温暖地睡了一觉。
    现在，真知子长大了，她也可以和在中学读书的哥哥姐姐们一样看家了。现在，她的爸爸是拒绝资方指名解雇的矿工之一，妈妈是“主妇会”的分会长，他们都很忙，顾不上照看孩子们的学习。但是，佐伯家的孩子们都肯用功，发愤地进行着学习。
    三池矿工的孩子们自发地进行了各种活动来支援矿工的斗争。高中的学生按地区组织了小组；初中和小学的学生也组织了小组。例如，港务所附近的新港职工宿舍区的“煤矿工人之子小组”，就是由小学六年级以上的学生组织的。他们组织起来，打扫道路，温习功课，辅导低年级同学的学习，还开展通信活动，把三池煤矿工人的斗争告诉全国各地的孩子们。在新港职工宿舍区里还有一个“友好小组”。这两个小组合在一起还出了一个小小的文艺刊物“鸽笛”，到7月为止已出了三期。在这个小刊物的园地上，撒播着矿工孩子们对反动派的憎恨和对工人阶级热爱的种子。参加“友好小组”的一个六年级小学生写了一首讽刺警察的短诗：“警察像野狗，窜来又窜去”。这诗句，并不是孩子们从学校教科书上学到的，而是他们在生活中得到的深刻的启示。自从警察出动镇压罢工以来，三池矿工的孩子们看到警察一点也不像教科书上所写的那样“文明”，他们就像野狗一样窜来窜去，袭击孩子们的父母和兄长。他们认清了警察的真面目，同时也看到了一万六千名工人纠察队同一万警察对垒的斗争场面。这一切给了他们多么深刻的阶级教育啊！
                ×　×　×
    斗争在锻炼着人，在改变着人。三池煤矿工人的斗争像一座熔炉一样，在冶炼、陶铸和考验着三池的老一代和新一代，男人和妇女。这就是三池煤矿斗争的最宝贵的收获之一。（附图片）
    孩子们跟着妈妈来到斗争大会的场所。面对着残酷艰苦的斗争，无论是孩子或母亲都毫无畏色，洋溢着乐观主义的精神。
    老大娘也戴着斗争标志——白毛巾来到矿井前，鼓励坚持斗争的矿工们。
