Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, September 21st: The Mongolian "Truth Daily" published an editorial today entitled "Friendship Week of Brotherly Neighboring Peoples," congratulating the opening of "Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Week."

The editorial said that the "Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Week" activities, which began today throughout Mongolia, are being carried out as the friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese people further develops.

The editorial said that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the great People's China has changed the face of the motherland in a short historical period and has achieved great achievements in the cause of socialist construction. The Chinese people have victoriously realized the socialist industrialization of the motherland and are now carrying out a technological revolution and a cultural revolution. The collective ownership of the People's Republic of China's economy has also achieved a complete victory.

The editorial said that every great achievement and victory achieved by the heroic Chinese people in peaceful construction greatly promotes the continuous strengthening and consolidation of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

The editorial said that under the direct influence of the Great October Socialist Revolution of the heroic Russians, the victory of the Mongolian Revolution in 1921 and the victory of the Chinese Revolution in 1949 opened a new stage for the fraternal friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese people, who have a long-standing neighboring relationship. Based on the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed in 1952, this great friendship is constantly developing and consolidating in all aspects, based on proletarian internationalism.

The editorial then praised the great assistance provided by the Chinese people to the socialist construction of the Mongolian people.

The editorial said that the "Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance between the Mongolian People's Republic and the People's Republic of China," the "Agreement on Economic and Technical Assistance from the Government of the People's Republic of China to the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic," and the "Agreement on Scientific and Artistic Cooperation between the Mongolian People's Republic and the People's Republic of China," signed during the friendly visit of Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Zhou Enlai, to Mongolia not long ago, have become a new stage in the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the Mongolian and Chinese people. These treaties and agreements not only further expand the friendly cooperation between our two peoples, but also have important significance for further consolidating the unity of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union and consolidating world peace and security.

The editorial said that learning more from the rich experience accumulated by the hardworking and humble Chinese people, who have achieved unprecedented great achievements in a short period of time, will greatly promote Mongolia's overall socialist construction.

The editorial said that the "Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Week" activities will contribute to the further development and prosperity of the friendship between the two peoples and make the Mongolian people more confident in the great struggle to build socialism.

　　中蒙人民友谊日益发展
　　蒙古“真理报”发表社论祝贺“蒙中友好旬”开幕
    据新华社乌兰巴托21日电　蒙古“真理报”今天发表题为“兄弟邻邦人民的友好旬”的社论，祝贺“蒙中友好旬”开幕。
    社论说，今天在蒙古全国各地开始举行的“蒙中友好旬”活动，是在蒙中两国人民的友谊进一步向前发展的时候开展的。
    社论说，伟大人民中国在共产党的领导下，在短短的历史时期内改变了祖国的面貌，在社会主义建设事业中取得了伟大成就。中国人民胜利地实现了祖国社会主义工业化，现在正在开展技术革命和文化革命。中华人民共和国经济集体所有制也取得了彻底的胜利。
    社论说，英勇的中国人民在和平建设的劳动中取得的每一个巨大成就和胜利，都大大促进了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营力量的不断增强和巩固。
    社论说，在英勇的俄罗斯人的伟大的十月社会主义革命的直接影响下，1921年蒙古革命胜利和1949年中国革命胜利为具有悠久邻邦关系的蒙中人民的兄弟友谊开辟了新阶段。这个伟大友谊在两国1952年签订的中蒙经济及文化合作协定的基础上，本着无产阶级国际主义，从各方面不断向前发展和巩固。
    社论接着盛赞了中国人民对蒙古人民的社会主义建设所提供的巨大援助。
    社论说，不久前，中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来同志在蒙古进行友好访问期间签订的“蒙古人民共和国和中华人民共和国友好互助条约”、“关于中华人民共和国政府给予蒙古人民共和国政府经济技术援助的协定”和“关于蒙古人民共和国和中华人民共和国科学艺术合作协定”，成为蒙中人民兄弟友谊和合作的新阶段。这些条约和协定不仅进一步扩大了我们两国人民的友好合作，而且对进一步巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结、巩固世界和平和安全具有重要意义。
    社论说，更多地学习在短时期获得史无前例的巨大成就的勤劳谦虚的中国人民积累的丰富经验将大大促进蒙古全面建设社会主义的事业。
    社论说，“蒙中友好旬”活动，将对两国人民之间友谊的进一步发展和繁荣作出贡献，使蒙古人民对建设社会主义的伟大斗争更加充满信心。
