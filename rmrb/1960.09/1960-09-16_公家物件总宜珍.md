    Public Property Should Always Be Cherished
        Chengdu Liu Xingrong
    When Comrade Xu Teli was the principal of the Hunan First Women's Normal School, he wrote a poem: "Even half a stick of chalk should be cherished, public property should always be treasured; the students do not understand my inner feelings, and instead say I am a calculating person."

    The "public" of that time and the "public" of today are, of course, different. The "public" of today is the real "public." The public property of today is the real public property. Cherishing public property and using it frugally is a virtue that everyone should abide by. However, cherishing public property to the extent of "even half a stick of chalk should be cherished" may not be achieved by everyone. In fact, thrift should always "focus on the big picture and start with the small things." Without thousands upon thousands of "calculating people" who cherish every grain of rice and every inch of cloth, we cannot use materials more effectively and accomplish more with the same amount of materials.

    Someone once asked Old Xu why he cherished the "not very useful" half stick of chalk. Old Xu replied, "Broken chalk can still be used to write; wouldn't it be a waste to discard it! Accumulate little things to make a lot, gather small things to make big things, and you can also save a little office expenses." "Calculating people" are those who are good at understanding great principles from small things. Understanding the importance of saving every bit of material will have a significant impact on saving in our populous and vast country.

    Why is it that some people "cherish even half a stick of chalk," while others think that half a stick of chalk is "not very useful" and not worth cherishing? The issue here is the attitude towards "public." The reason why Old Xu was "calculating" was because he believed that public property should always be cherished. The Fifth Canteen of the Wangjiaba Commune in Chengdu even covers the rice-filtering sieve and the tables for distributing food with gauze to prevent a single grain of rice from being spilled. They feel that we have suffered enough in the past, and we should not forget the pain once the wound has healed; we should live rich days as if they were poor days, and save more wealth for the country to create a better and happier life. We need more and more "calculating people" who are loyal to the "public" and forgetful of the "private."

### 公家物件总宜珍

    公家物件总宜珍
        成都  刘兴荣
    徐特立同志在湖南第一女子师范学校当校长时，写了一首诗：“半截粉笔犹爱惜，公家物件总宜珍，诸生不解余衷曲，反谓余为算细人。”
    当时的公和现在的公，当然是不同的。现在的公，才是真正的公。今天的公物才是真正的公物。爱惜公物，节约使用公物，这是人人都应遵守的美德。可是爱惜公物爱到“半截粉笔犹爱惜”的程度却未必都能达到。其实，节约总是应该从“大处着眼，小处着手”的。没有千千万个惜粒米、惜寸布的“算细人”，就不能更有效地使用物资，使同样多的物资办更多的事情。
    有人曾经问徐老，为什么要爱惜这“没有多大用处”的半截粉笔？徐老回答说：“碎粉笔还可写字，抛弃岂不可惜！积少成多，集小成大，也可以节省一点办公费用。”“算细人”是善于从小事情中悟出大道理的人。懂得节约点滴物资，这在人多地广的我国，其节约意义将是多么重大。
    为什么有人“半截粉笔犹爱惜”，有的人则认为半截粉笔“无多大用处”不值一惜呢？这里面就是对“公”的态度问题。徐老之所以“算细”，那是因为他认为公家物件总宜珍的缘故。成都市王家坝公社第五食堂，连滤米的筲箕和分饭的桌上都铺上纱布，不让一粒米一颗饭抛撒。他们觉得，我们从前受尽了苦，不要好了疮疤忘了痛，富日子要当穷日子过，多为国家节约财富，才能创造更美好的幸福生活。我们需要多多益善的忠于“公”而忘于“私”的“算细人”。
