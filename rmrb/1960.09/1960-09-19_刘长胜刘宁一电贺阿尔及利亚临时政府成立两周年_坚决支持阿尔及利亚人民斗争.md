Xinhua News Agency, September 18th: Liu Changsheng, President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association, sent a telegram today to Prime Minister Ferhat Abbas on the second anniversary of the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, stating that the Algerian people's national liberation war has set a brilliant example for the national liberation movements of the peoples of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The telegram also expressed deep belief that the Algerian people will surely liberate all the sacred Algerian territory from colonial rule.

In the telegram, Liu Changsheng warmly congratulated Prime Minister Abbas and the heroic Algerian people on the second anniversary of the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria. The telegram stated: "The Algerian people, unyielding in their adherence to the national liberation war, have continuously dealt heavy blows to the French colonial army supported by U.S. imperialism for more than five years, achieving brilliant victories and powerfully supporting and encouraging the African people's struggle for national independence and the struggle of the people of all countries against imperialism, colonialism, and in defense of world peace. The Algerian people's national liberation war has set a brilliant example for the national liberation movements of the peoples of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The Chinese people hold the brotherly Algerian people in high esteem and are elated by the victories achieved by the Algerian people in their struggle! The 650 million Chinese people have resolutely supported, are now resolutely supporting, and will resolutely support in the future the struggle of Algeria and the entire African people against imperialism and colonialism and for national independence!

"We firmly believe that, with the firm support of the people of the world, the Algerian people, who have been tempered in the flames of revolutionary war and are growing stronger with each battle, will unite even more closely, persevere in their struggle, be vigilant against the conspiracies of imperialism, and will certainly be able to completely liberate all the sacred Algerian territory from colonial rule and achieve final victory.

"We wish the Algerian people's national liberation struggle continuous and brilliant victories!

"We wish the friendly solidarity between the Chinese people and the Algerian and African peoples will be increasingly consolidated and developed!"

Xinhua News Agency, September 18th: Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, sent a telegram today to Ma Shu, Secretary of the Overseas Delegation of the General Union of Algerian Workers, on the second anniversary of the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, extending warm congratulations on behalf of all Chinese workers to the fighting Algerian people. Liu Ningyi's telegram stated: "For six years, the Algerian people have always held high the banner of the national liberation war and stood firmly at the forefront of the African people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism. Your struggle has not only heavily struck at French imperialism and the U.S. imperialism that supports it, and continuously achieved victories, but has also greatly encouraged and helped the surging development of the African people's movement for national independence. A series of African countries have declared independence, and recently the Congolese soldiers and civilians, like the Algerian people, have risen up to resist the aggression and interference of U.S.-led imperialism. The raging fire of anti-colonialism in Africa is destroying the rule of imperialism in Africa. The heroic struggle of the Algerian people has made a brilliant contribution to the liberation of the entire African continent.

The Chinese working class resolutely and unswervingly supports the national independence struggle of the workers and people of Algeria and all African countries. We firmly believe that with the strong support of the socialist camp, the people of Asia and Africa, and the people of the world, the Algerian and African people will surely achieve complete national independence."
