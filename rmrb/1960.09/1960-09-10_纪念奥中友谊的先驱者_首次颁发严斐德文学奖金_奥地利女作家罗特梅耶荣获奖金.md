Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 8th. The Yan Feide Literary Prize, established in memory of a close friend of the Chinese people and a pioneer of Sino-Austrian friendship, was awarded for the first time in Austria.

The judging committee decided to award the prize to Austrian writer Gerda Rottmayer for her reportage "Marry Quickly." Gerda Rottmayer is a reporter for the "Austrian People's Voice" newspaper.

The purpose of the Yan Feide Foundation is, in the spirit of this late writer and doctor, a participant in China's liberation war, to encourage talented young writers to regard reportage as a special form of militant literature. Yan Feide was an outstanding Austrian journalist who died in 1955 en route to the Bandung Conference. In 1939, as a doctor and a fighter for the cause of human liberation, he traveled to China's anti-Japanese battlefield; in 1953, as a reporter for the "Austrian People's Voice," he came to China again, using his pen as a bugle, everywhere singing songs to inspire people for the construction of New China. After Yan Feide's death, Yan Feide's wife used the money from the royalties of his literary works to establish this prize.

    纪念奥中友谊的先驱者
    首次颁发严斐德文学奖金
    奥地利女作家罗特梅耶荣获奖金
    新华社维也纳8日电　为纪念中国人民亲密的朋友和奥中友谊的先驱者而设立的严斐德文学奖金第一次在奥地利授奖。
    评奖委员会决定把这个奖金授予奥地利女作家格达·罗特梅耶，她的得奖作品是报告文学“快快结婚吧”。格达·罗特梅耶是“奥地利人民之声报”的记者。
    严斐德基金会的目的是根据这位已故作家和医生、中国解放战争的参加者的精神，促使有才能的青年作家把报告文学作为一种特殊的战斗的文艺形式来看待。严斐德是1955年前往参加万隆会议时在途中遇难的奥地利杰出的新闻工作者。1939年他曾作为一个医生和谋求人类解放事业的战士辗转来到中国的抗日战场；1953年他又以“奥地利人民之声报”记者的身份来到中国，把笔杆当作号角到处为新中国的建设吹起感召人们的歌声。严斐德遇难后，严斐德夫人从他的文学著作的版税中提出的钱设立了这一奖金。
