　　More than half a month has passed since I left Cuba, and I will never forget this lovely country and its people! The magnificent ocean, towering palm trees; the female militia actively drilling under the scorching sun; and the powerful masses who rallied and demonstrated against U.S. imperialism in Republic Square on July 10... This pearl of the Caribbean is shining brightly for all mankind. All of this has left an indelible impression on me. The deep friendship and heartfelt love of the Cuban people for the Chinese people is even more touching, beyond the description of my clumsy pen. I just want to talk about some of my observations and feelings on how artistic exchange has brought the people of China and Cuba closer together.

　　A Cuban's Peking Opera Photograph

　　In my suitcase, I treasure a Peking Opera photo of my Cuban friend Mr. Fermín (Director of the Drama Department of the National Theater). This friend, who was responsible for receiving and helping us with our work, was like the Cuban people; he was able to understand and deeply love Peking Opera very quickly after his first contact with it. Fermín not only tried to watch every one of our performances, but also asked: Can foreigners also learn Peking Opera? He said he would like to try. When we gave our last performance in Havana, he finally solemnly asked me to draw a facial makeup for him, dress him in full costume, and take a Peking Opera photo as a souvenir.

　　I picked up the brush and felt so refreshed, even more excited than the first time I put on makeup. I carefully applied the colors on his face stroke by stroke, hoping to use my decades of experience to paint the best facial makeup possible.

　　For us Jing role actors, drawing facial makeup is of course commonplace; but from a Chinese point of view, people generally prefer to play a Dan role rather than paint a big painted face. The weather in Havana in July was very hot, and the backstage area was not spacious, so we were both sweating profusely after painting for a few minutes. But throughout the three-quarters of an hour, Fermín sat still and listened to me attentively from beginning to end, and the subsequent head-wrapping and armor-tying were equally serious and meticulous, just like a most well-behaved elementary school student. Finally, he was dressed as He Tianlong from "Yandang Mountain" and took a photo. This Peking Opera photo of a Cuban friend became a symbol of friendship and artistic exchange.

　　Cuban Friends Appreciate "Wild Boar Forest"

　　After we successfully concluded our tour of Cuba, we returned to Havana to prepare for the performance of full-length operas – "Wild Boar Forest" and "The Tale of the White Snake."

　　Although the tour of Cuba was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people, the reaction to the full-length operas had not yet been verified by practice. "The Tale of the White Snake" had been performed twice in Caracas, Venezuela, and had been a great success; "Wild Boar Forest" had not yet met the audience since going abroad, so every comrade worked extra hard to further refine their artistic performance, hoping that the Cuban audience could see our more perfect artistic performance.

　　The Havana National Theater was not completely repaired before our tour, but after we returned, it was largely completed. On the day of the performance of "Wild Boar Forest," the entrance of the theater was crowded, and the theater was still filled with the smell of new houses. Both the audience and the actors were particularly excited to wait for the opening gong.

　　From the very beginning, the actors' sensitivity made me feel that the audience understood and accepted our performance, which completely put my mind at ease and allowed me to enter the creation of the character. As the plot developed on the stage, our hearts and the audience's hearts got closer and closer. All the laughter and applause that usually occurred during performances in China did not diminish due to the language barrier. Until the end of the play, the audience demanded that we take curtain calls again and again with thunderous applause, and we were truly indescribably excited.

　　Both full-length operas were successful, and both the newspapers and the audience's opinions gave high praise and admiration. Some audience members simply called Lin Chong and Lu Zhishen in the play "July 26" (referring to the revolutionary faction). The Cuban people deeply understood the central idea of ​​this play – the people could not bear the cruel oppression of the rulers and were forced to go to Liangshan to make revolution. Therefore, some people scolded Gao Qiu in the play as Batista. They loved and praised the heroes in the play like the Chinese people, and hated the negative characters.

　　Exciting Cuban Dance Drama

　　In addition to introducing our own national art to the Cuban people, we also seized the opportunity to learn from them. The performance of modern dance drama at the National Theater left a deep impression on us.

　　The curtain opened, and there were no gorgeous sets and decorations on the stage. We were also not familiar with the dance vocabulary of modern dance. But what strongly attracted us was the clear anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism political theme of the dance drama.

　　The first dance drama, "Mestizo," exposed the crime of the colonialists – white people – insulting and bullying black wives, and the struggle of the black people to finally kill the white people out of hatred and resistance. The second dance drama directly reflected the struggle against U.S. imperialism: in a sugarcane field, agricultural workers were working, and the Americans came, drove the workers away, and became tyrannical. The workers rose up to fight, and finally two black-clad gods appeared and strangled U.S. imperialism with a noose. At this time, a burst of applause broke out in the audience, and we also clapped and cheered together with our Cuban friends!

　　The Cuban revolution has only been successful for a little over a year, but the revolutionary government attaches great importance to the development and construction of its national art. It has established a national theater, which has a special national art department, and is planning to establish a national song and dance troupe and establish theater organizations in various provinces. In addition, rural cooperatives are also planning to establish theater groups. Friends in the Cuban art world have made gratifying achievements in a short period of time with full political enthusiasm. They are not only enthusiastic about artistic creation, but also actively participate in the political life of the people. The theater has a militia organization, and on July 10, we and the militia of the National Theater participated in the anti-U.S. imperialism demonstration and rally. The common goal of anti-imperialist struggle has made us the closest friends and brothers.

　　There are really many precious and unforgettable things, and it is difficult to tell them all one by one. The short two months of performing in Cuba was a great education and encouragement for us. It made me further realize the truth that we are familiar with – the national art of the real people will be understood and loved by the broadest masses of the people. The common struggle against imperialism – especially U.S. imperialism – has given us a common language, and the performance has received an even stronger response.

    艺术和友谊的花朵并蒂开	袁世海
    离开古巴已经半个多月了，这个可爱的国家和它的人民令我十分难忘！那波澜壮阔的海洋，参天的棕榈；在酷热的阳光下，积极操练的女民兵；以及7月10日在共和国广场上反对美帝国主义集会示威的强大群众队伍，……这一颗加勒比海的珍珠正在时刻向全人类闪闪发光。所有这些都给我留下了不可磨灭的印象。古巴人民对中国人民的深厚友情和倾心热爱，感人更深，不是我这支拙笔所能形容的。我只想谈一点通过艺术交流而使中古两国人民更加接近的见闻和感受。
    一张古巴人的京剧照片
    在我的箱子里珍藏着一位古巴朋友凡尔明先生（国家剧院戏剧部主任）的脸谱剧照。这位负责接待和帮助我们工作的朋友，像古巴人民一样，初次接触京剧，就很快能够理解并深深地爱上了它。我们的演出，凡尔明不但争取每场都看，还问：外国人是否也能学习京剧？他说他很想尝试。当我们在哈瓦那最后一场演出时，他终于郑重地提出，要求我为他抅个脸谱，全身披挂起来，照一张京剧剧照留作纪念。
    我拿起笔，感到那么新鲜，比我头一次上妆还要激动得多。我一笔一划小心翼翼地在他脸上涂染颜色，希望能运用自己几十年的经验画出一张最好的脸谱。
    画脸谱，对我们净角演员来说，固然早就习以为常；但就中国人的心理来说，一般都是宁愿扮个旦角也不愿意画个大花脸。哈瓦那7月的天气是很炎热的，后台也并不宽敞，画了几分钟我俩就都汗流浃背。但从头到尾三刻钟，凡尔明始终一动不动地静坐在那儿听我摆布，以后的勒头扎靠也同样是严肃认真，一丝不苟，就像一个最守规矩的小学生。终于扮成了，扮的是《雁荡山》的贺天龙，并拍了照。这张古巴朋友的京剧剧照成了友谊与艺术交流的象征。古巴朋友欣赏《野猪林》
    我们胜利地结束了在古巴各地的巡回演出后回到哈瓦那，就准备本子戏——《野猪林》和《白蛇传》的演出。
    虽然在古巴各地的巡回演出，受到了广大人民的热烈欢迎，但本子戏的反映如何，还未经实践来验证。《白蛇传》曾在委内瑞拉的加拉加斯演过两场，得到了很大的成功；《野猪林》出国以来还没有同观众见过面，这次头一场就演它，所以每个同志都格外努力地进行再一次的艺术锤炼，希望古巴观众能够看到我们更加完美的艺术表演。
    哈瓦那国立剧院在我们巡回演出前还没有完全修好，回来以后，却已大体落成。《野猪林》演出的那一天，剧场门口人声鼎沸，剧场里还散发着新房子的气味，观众和演员都格外兴奋地等待着那一声开场锣。
    从一开场起，演员的敏感就使我感受到观众懂得并接受了我们的演出，这使我完全安下心来进入人物的创造。随着舞台上剧情的发展，我们与观众的心也越来越靠近，平时在国内演出进行中所有的笑声掌声，并未因语言的隔阂而减少，直到剧终，观众以雷动的掌声要求我们一再谢幕，我们真是说不出的兴奋。
    两个本子戏都获得了成功，无论是报纸和观众舆论都给予了很高的评价和赞美。有些观众干脆称剧中的林冲和鲁智深为“7月26日”（即指革命派之意）。古巴人民深深地懂得了这个戏的中心思想——人民不堪统治者的残酷压迫，被逼上梁山闹革命，所以有人骂剧中的高俅是巴蒂斯塔。他们像中国人民一样热爱并赞扬剧中的英雄，憎恨反面人物。
    激动人心的古巴舞剧
    我们除了向古巴人民介绍自己的民族艺术外，也抓紧机会向他们学习。国家剧院的现代舞剧的演出，给我们留下了深刻的印象。
    幕开了，舞台上并没有华丽的布景和装饰，现代舞的舞蹈语汇我们也并不熟悉。但是强烈地吸引着我们的是舞剧鲜明的反殖民主义、反帝国主义的政治主题。
    第一个舞剧《混血人》，暴露了殖民主义者——白种人污辱欺凌黑人妻子的罪恶，以及黑人出于仇恨与反抗终于将白人杀死的斗争。第二个舞剧直接反映了反对美帝国主义的斗争：在一片甘蔗园里，农业工人们正在劳动，美国人来了，将工人赶走而横行霸道起来，工人们起来斗争，最后出现两个穿黑衣的神，将美帝国主义用绞索勒死。这时台下爆发了一片掌声，我们也和古巴朋友一起拍手称快！
    古巴革命成功仅仅一年多，但革命政府很重视自己的民族艺术的发展和建设，成立了国家剧院，其中设有专门的民族艺术部，并正在筹建国家歌舞团和在各省建立戏剧组织；另外，农村的合作社也计划成立戏剧团体。古巴艺术界的朋友，在短短的时间内，就以饱满的政治热情作出了令人可喜的成绩。他们不仅热心于艺术创作，也积极参加人民的政治生活。剧院有民兵组织，7月10日我们和国家剧院的民兵一同参加了反对美帝国主义示威游行和集会。反帝斗争的共同目标使我们成为最亲密的朋友和兄弟。
    珍贵和难忘的事情实在很多，难以一一道尽。在古巴演出的短短两个月，对我们的教育和鼓舞是很大的，它使我进一步认识了我们所熟知的真理——真正的人民的民族艺术，将得到最广大人民的理解和热爱。反对帝国主义——特别是美帝国主义的共同斗争，更使我们有着共同的语言，演出也得到了更加强烈的回响。
