    支持刚果政府反对干涉
    几内亚军队决定撤出“联合国军”
    新华社10日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：在刚果的几内亚军司令部9日宣布，它决定暂时把它的军队从“联合国军”里撤出来，以支持卢蒙巴总理和他对联合国干涉刚果内政的谴责。消息说，几内亚的迪亚尼将军已经把几内亚军司令部的决定通知在利奥波德维尔的“联合国军司令部”。
    几内亚驻利奥波德维尔的代表团团长通卡拉在记者招待会上宣布了这个决定。他说，由于联合国粗暴地干涉刚果事务，本地的几内亚军司令部作出了这个决定，并且已经报告给杜尔总统，要求他批准这个决定。通卡拉强调非洲团结的重要性，并且谴责联合国无视刚果主权封闭刚果国家电台和控制刚果机场的行动。
