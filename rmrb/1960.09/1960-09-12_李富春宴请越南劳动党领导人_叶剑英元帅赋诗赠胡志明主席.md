Li Fuchun, head of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, who was invited to attend the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Third National Congress of the Labor Party of Vietnam, hosted a banquet for leading comrades of the Central Committee of the Labor Party of Vietnam at the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam this noon.

    Chairman Ho Chi Minh, Le Duan, Truong Chinh, Pham Van Dong, Vo Nguyen Giap, Nguyen Duy Trinh, Le Thanh Nghi, Hoang Van Hoan and other comrades attended this cordial and pleasant banquet.

    Members of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation, member of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Marshal Ye Jianying, and Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam He Wei also attended the banquet.

    The banquet was filled with a joyful atmosphere throughout.

    At the banquet, Marshal Ye Jianying read a letter he wrote to Chairman Ho Chi Minh. The letter stated:

    "I am honored to participate in our country's Party and Government Delegation to the capital of Vietnam to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and to attend the Third National Congress of the Labor Party of Vietnam. I have learned many things and gained much knowledge. I thank the Labor Party of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people, especially thank you for your invitation."

    The letter said: "Tomorrow we are about to return to our country. I specially present my humble poems 'Miscellaneous Poems on Vietnam', four in total, to record my impressions, express my gratitude, and ask for your corrections."

    Then, Marshal Ye Jianying recited his poems:

    Miscellaneous Poems on Vietnam

    I. Revisiting Hanoi (1917-1960)
    Time flies like a river,
    Forty-three years have passed since my revisit.
    The cuckoo cries its fill with betel blood,
    The Jingwei bird fills the French imperial abyss.
    Raising the red flag to advocate uprising,
    Spreading Marxism-Leninism to the countryside.
    Dien Bien Phu achieves victory for national stability,
    The motherland cheers as Uncle Ho returns.

    II. The 15th Anniversary of Vietnam's National Day
    Fifteen years of arduous management,
    Strong politics always taking the lead.
    National defense is consolidated, the three armies are strong,
    Production is abundant, adding ten thousand bushels.
    North and South, writing and vehicles look forward to unification,
    East and West, technology compete for excellence.
    When the plans are completed in the future,
    Crack the whip fiercely on the communist journey.

    III. A Toast to Chairman Ho
    Uncle Ho is thirty-five and thirty years of age,
    His spirit is vigorous in his prime.
    In the North, we are delighted to see no freezing or starvation,
    In the South, we worry about the bloody turmoil.
    Bearing the responsibility for world peace,
    Happily forming a serene bond with the forests and springs.
    I wish to call out "Mo Nam" in praise,
    May the Red River roll on with boundless longevity.

    IV. Visiting Ha Long Bay
    From afar, it resembles Mount Jiuyi,
    Suddenly appearing in Vietnam's shallow bay.
    The mirage refracts the light,
    Like dragons and tigers in the misty wilderness.
    Arranging the Eight Formations to resist powerful enemies,
    Occupying the isolated peak to resist the evil barbarians.
    The socialist camp is as solid as iron,
    Relying on natural barriers to defend the homeland.

    Another poem by Li Fuchun and Ye Jianying:

    Visiting Ha Long Bay
    Misty rain over Ha Long Bay,
    Ten thousand mountains stand tall in the middle of the sea,
    The drumbeat directs the boat straight into the deep mountains,
    The mirror reflects fishing boats, the cave holds heaven.

    李富春宴请越南劳动党领导人
    叶剑英元帅赋诗赠胡志明主席
    新华社河内11日电　应邀参加越南民主共和国成立十五周年和劳动党第三次全国代表大会的中国党政代表团团长、中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李富春，今天中午在中国驻越南大使馆宴请越南劳动党中央领导同志。
    胡志明主席、黎笋、长征、范文同、武元甲、阮维祯、黎清毅、黄文欢等同志出席了这个亲切、愉快的宴会。
    中国党政代表团团员、中共中央委员、国防委员会副主席叶剑英元帅，中国驻越南大使何伟也参加了宴会。
    宴会始终充满了欢乐的气氛。
    叶剑英元帅在宴会上宣读了他写给胡志明主席的一封信。信中说：
  “我荣幸地参加我国党政代表团，到越南首都祝贺越南民主共和国成立十五周年，又参加了越南劳动党第三次全国代表大会，学到许多东西，获得不少知识，感谢越南劳动党和越南人民，特别是感谢你对我的邀请。”
    信中说：“明天我们即将返国，特呈拙诗‘越南杂咏’四首，以志观感，聊表谢忱，并请斧正。”
    接着叶剑英元帅朗诵了他作的诗：
    越南杂咏
    一、重游河内（1917——1960）
    弹指光阴似逝川，
    重游四十有三年。
    杜鹃啼尽槟榔血，
    精卫填平法帝渊。
    高举红旗倡起义，
    遍传马列到乡关。
    奠边取得安邦胜，
    祖国欢呼伯伯还。
    二、越南十五周年国庆
    艰苦经营十五年，
    富强政治总领先。
    国防巩固三军壮，
    生产丰饶万斛添。
    南北车书看统一，
    东西技术竞精尖。
    他年计划完成后，
    共产征途猛着鞭。
    三、寿胡主席
    胡公三十五公岁，
    奕奕精神正盛年。
    北部欣看无冻饿，
    南方忧虑有腥膻。
    担当世界和平责，
    喜结林泉淡泊缘。
    愿以“摩南”呼一颂，
    红河滚滚寿绵绵。
    四、游下龙湾
    长征遥望九疑山，
    忽在越南浅水湾。
    海市蜃楼光曲折，
    如龙似虎雾迷蛮。
    安排八阵拒强敌，
    占据孤峰抗恶獌。
    社会阵营坚似铁，
    好凭天险卫乡关。
    另李富春、叶剑英联一首
    游下龙湾
    烟雨蒙蒙下龙湾，
    万山矗立海中间，
    鼓轮直向深山去，
    镜有渔舟洞有天。
