Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, September 22nd: More than 200,000 school-age children of all nationalities in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have recently enrolled in schools. Currently, the number of primary school children of all nationalities in school has reached more than 953,000, accounting for more than 95% of all school-age children. Thus, primary education has been fully popularized among the thirteen nationalities in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which is a major event in improving the cultural and educational level of all nationalities.

Under the care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, primary education for all nationalities in Xinjiang has developed extremely rapidly in recent years, and the original backward situation has been fundamentally changed. Before liberation, due to the reactionary ruling class's cruel oppression of all nationalities in Xinjiang, Xinjiang's cultural and educational undertakings could not be developed for a long time. By the eve of liberation, only 24% of school-age children in Xinjiang were enrolled in schools. After the liberation of Xinjiang, education developed vigorously. The state and governments at all levels allocate funds every year to develop education. Up to now, the number of primary schools in Xinjiang has increased from more than 1,000 in the early days of liberation to 4,436. In the eighty-three counties and cities throughout the autonomous region, every commune and team now has a primary school. Schools have also been set up in many remote rural areas and grasslands and mountainous areas where there were no schools before, giving a new look to primary education for all nationalities.

With the realization of the people's commune system, a new situation of great development and universalization of primary education has emerged in Xinjiang. Due to the implementation of the "walking on two legs" policy in the development of primary education, and also because the people's communes have created favorable conditions for the enrollment of children of all ethnic groups, privately run primary schools have generally developed. Within two years, the number of privately run primary schools increased sharply from 61 in 1957 to more than 1,800 in the first half of 1960, an increase of nearly 30 times, which is more than the total number of primary schools in Xinjiang before liberation.

In the past two years, while primary education in Xinjiang has developed greatly, its quality has also improved. According to a statistical examination conducted in Bachu County in the first half of this year, more than 20,000 of the 23,000 primary school students in the county achieved excellent results.

With the development and popularization of primary education, the number of primary school graduates from all ethnic groups has increased year by year. Xinjiang's education has begun to advance to a new stage of popularizing secondary education. The number of full-time secondary schools has increased sharply from 117 in 1957 to 211 in the first half of 1960, and the number of students enrolled has increased by 55%. In addition, 323 agricultural and pastoral middle schools have been established.

　　新疆各民族普及小学教育
　  开始向普及中学教育的新阶段迈进
    据新华社乌鲁木齐22日电　新疆维吾尔自治区最近有二十多万各民族的学龄儿童入学。目前各民族小学在校儿童已达九十五万三千多人，占全部学龄儿童的95％以上。至此，在新疆维吾尔自治区的十三个民族中，小学教育已全部普及，这是提高各民族文化教育水平的一件大事。
    新疆各民族的小学教育事业在党中央和毛主席的关怀下，几年来发展极为迅速，原来的落后面貌有了根本改变。解放前，由于反动统治阶级对新疆各民族的残酷压迫，新疆文化教育事业长期不能得到发展。到解放前夕，全疆学龄儿童只有24％入学。新疆解放后，教育事业才蓬勃发展起来。国家和各级人民政府每年拨款发展教育事业。到目前为止，全疆小学校已由解放初期的一千多所发展到四千四百三十六所。在全自治区八十三个县市内，现在社社、队队都有了小学，许多边远农村和原来没有一所学校的草原、山区，也都办起了学校，使各民族小学教育事业面貌一新。
    随着人民公社化的实现，新疆小学教育出现了大发展、大普及的新局面。由于在小学教育发展方面贯彻了两条腿走路的方针，同时也由于人民公社为各族人民的子女入学创造了有利的条件，民办小学普遍发展起来。两年内，民办小学从1957年的六十一所猛增到1960年上半年的一千八百多所，增加了近三十倍，比解放前新疆小学校的总数还多。
    两年来，新疆小学教育在大发展的同时，质量也提高了。据巴楚县今年上半年一次考试统计，全县两万三千名小学生，获得优良成绩的就在两万名以上。
    随着小学教育事业的发展和普及，各民族的小学毕业生逐年增加。新疆教育事业已开始向普及中学教育的新阶段迈进。现在全日制中学已从1957年一百十七所，猛增到1960年上半年的二百十一所，在校学生增加了55％。另外还兴办了农牧业中学三百二十三所。
