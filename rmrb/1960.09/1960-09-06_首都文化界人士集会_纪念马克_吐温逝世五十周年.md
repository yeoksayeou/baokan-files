Xinhua News Agency, September 5th. Cultural figures from the capital gathered this afternoon to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the death of Mark Twain, a world cultural figure and progressive American writer of the nineteenth century.

    Lao She, Standing Committee Member of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Vice Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, delivered a speech at the commemoration meeting entitled "Mark Twain: Exposer of the 'Gilded Age'." In his speech, he introduced the historical background of Mark Twain's creations and the positive influence of Mark Twain's many progressive works in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. He pointed out that Mark Twain was a progressive writer who loved peace and democracy and was full of a sense of justice. From the day the United States became an imperialist nation in the 1890s, Mark Twain, with his sharp pen, used essays, short stories, and especially political commentaries, to continuously expose the aggressive atrocities of American imperialism against backward countries in Asia and Africa and the false civilization of American capitalism. He also made sharp satires on the so-called democracy, freedom, and equality that the American bourgeoisie was accustomed to boasting about, and expressed deep sympathy for the anti-colonial struggles of the people of Asia and Africa. Therefore, although Mark Twain's works were hated by the reactionary ruling class in the United States, some were listed as banned books, and even could not be published, his works in this regard are still a weapon for progressive mankind to oppose wars of aggression, resist imperialism and colonialism, and defend world peace. Lao She said: Today, when the imperialist war forces headed by the United States are trying to make a dying struggle, and the flames of national liberation movements are burning everywhere in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, commemorating Mark Twain is of even greater significance.

    At the commemoration meeting, writers and professors Ye Junjian, Zhou Jueliang, Xie Bingxin and others analyzed and introduced Mark Twain's works.

    The commemoration meeting was jointly organized the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Chinese Writers Association. Cai Chusheng, Xiao San, Yang Shuo, Zhu Boshen, Wang Yafan, Xing Ye and other well-known figures in cultural circles attended the commemoration meeting.

    首都文化界人士集会
    纪念马克·吐温逝世五十周年
    新华社5日讯　首都文化界人士今天下午集会，纪念世界文化名人、十九世纪美国进步作家马克·吐温逝世五十周年。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员、中国作家协会副主席老舍在纪念会上作了题为“马克·吐温：‘金元帝国’的揭露者”的发言。在发言中，他介绍了马克·吐温的创作历史背景，以及马克·吐温的许多进步作品在反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义斗争中的积极影响。他指出：马克·吐温是一位热爱和平、民主，富有正义感的进步作家。从十九世纪九十年代美国成为帝国主义的那一天开始，马克·吐温就以他锋利的文笔，用散文、短篇小说、特别是政论的形式，不断揭露美帝国主义对亚非落后国家的侵略暴行和美国资本主义的虚假文明，并对美国资产阶级惯于吹嘘的所谓民主、自由、平等作了尖刻的嘲讽，对亚非人民反殖民主义的斗争表示了深切的同情。因此，马克·吐温的作品虽然在美国受到反动统治阶级的仇视，一部分被列为禁书，甚至不能出版，但是，他的这方面的作品至今仍是进步人类反对侵略战争，反抗帝国主义、殖民主义，保卫世界和平的一个武器。老舍说：在以美国为首的帝国主义战争势力妄图垂死挣扎，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲遍地燃起民族解放运动的烽火的今天，我们来纪念马克·吐温，更具有重要的意义。
    在纪念会上，作家和教授叶君健、周珏良、谢冰心等人都对马克·吐温的作品作了分析和介绍。
    纪念会由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国人民对外文化协会、中国文学艺术界联合会、中国作家协会联合举办。蔡楚生、萧三、杨朔、朱伯深、王亚凡、邢野等文化界著名人士出席了纪念会。
