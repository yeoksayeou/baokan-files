    Cultivating Culinary Workers Who Are Both Red and Expert
    State Council Offices Administration Establishes Culinary School

    (Our Dispatch) The State Council Offices Administration has established a culinary school, and held its opening ceremony on the 6th.

    This school was founded in the spirit of diligence and thrift; the school buildings and equipment were all vacated by the offices, and the faculty and staff are also part-time positions held by office staff and famous chefs from major restaurants. The school has both advanced study classes and ordinary classes. Some young intellectuals and chefs with a certain foundation who volunteer to participate in this glorious post will receive the Party's cultivation and further training here.

    Vice Premier of the State Council Xi Zhongxun attended the opening ceremony. Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council Qi Yanming, and Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council and Principal of the State Council Offices Administration Culinary School Gao Dengbang spoke at the opening ceremony. They unanimously pointed out that this culinary school is a school for cultivating culinary workers who are both red and expert, and the establishment of such a school is very necessary: the skills and experience of the older generation of culinary workers need to be inherited as soon as possible; China's rich culinary scientific heritage of thousands of years also needs to be collected, sorted out, and improved as soon as possible. Culinary work is an indispensable and important task in the cause of socialist construction, and therefore culinary workers are glorious. In our new society, the objects of service for culinary workers are the thousands upon thousands of people who are working diligently for socialist construction, bringing them convenience and pleasure in their lives, so that they can devote themselves to production and learning with more energy. In their speeches, they requested all students to study Mao Zedong Thought hard, adhere to putting politics in command, work hard and live plainly, and study assiduously, so that they can train themselves to become culinary workers with communist consciousness, a certain amount of cultural and scientific knowledge, and specialized business skills, so as to better serve the people.

    Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Yu Xinqing, and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Party Committee of the Central State Organs Zheng Siyuan also spoke at the opening ceremony. Teacher representatives and student representatives unanimously stated in their speeches that they are grateful to the Party for its attention and care for culinary work.

    培养又红又专的烹饪工作者
    国务院机关事务管理局成立烹饪学校
    本报讯　国务院机关事务管理局成立烹饪学校，6日举行开学典礼。
    这个学校是本着勤俭办学的精神创办的，校舍和设备都是机关腾让的，教职员也是由机关工作人员和各大饭店的名厨师兼职。学校设有进修班和普通班，一些志愿参加这个光荣岗位的知识青年和有一定基础的厨师，将在这里得到党的培育和深造。
    国务院副总理习仲勋参加了开学典礼。国务院副秘书长齐燕铭、国务院副秘书长兼国务院机关事务管理局烹饪学校校长高登榜在开学典礼上讲了话。他们一致指出，这个烹饪学校是培养又红又专的烹饪工作者的学校，成立这样一个学校是很必要的：老一辈烹饪工作者的技艺和经验需要及早地继承；我国几千年来丰富的烹饪科学遗产也需要及早地收集、整理和提高。烹饪工作是社会主义建设事业中不可缺少的一项重要工作，因而烹饪工作者是光荣的。在我们新社会里，烹饪工作者服务的对象是千千万万为社会主义建设而辛勤劳动的人民群众，给他们带来生活上的方便和愉快，使他们更加精力充沛地投入生产和学习。他们在讲话中要求全体学员，努力学习毛泽东思想，坚持政治挂帅，艰苦朴素，刻苦钻研，使自己锻炼成为具有共产主义觉悟，具有一定文化科学知识和专门业务技能的烹饪工作者，以便更好地为人民服务。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副秘书长余心清、中央国家机关党委会书记处书记郑思远也在开学典礼上讲了话。教师代表和学员代表在讲话中一致表示，感谢党对烹饪工作的重视和关怀。
