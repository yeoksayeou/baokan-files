    Ode to An Chengxiang's Fragrance
    Dong Biwu
    An Chengxiang, a poor peasant girl from Sinan County, Guizhou Province, is a sixteen-year-old member of the Communist Youth League, serving as a cook in the Shuikousi public canteen of the Qinggangpo People's Commune. On the night of February 14th this year, thieves stole public grain from the canteen. Chengxiang resisted independently, sustaining nine knife wounds to the head. She held onto the thief and refused to let go, and the thief was eventually captured. The canteen's grain was saved thanks to Chengxiang's efforts.

    Nine knife wounds to the head, yet the canteen's grain was saved without delay.
    Although young and only a cook, her character is higher than Xie Xiao'e. (Note)
    Resisting thieves with the courage of Xu Xuehui, her loyalty resembles that of Liu Hulan.
    This young peasant girl has no selfish thoughts, and should be seen as a role model for youth.
  Note: Xie Xiao'e is a woman recorded in Tang dynasty legends who bravely fought against the enemies who killed her father and husband.

    咏安成香
    董必武
    贵州思南县贫农安成香，是一个十六岁的女共青团员，担任县青杠坡人民公社水口寺公共食堂的炊事员。今年二月十四日夜晚，有贼偷食堂公粮，成香独立抗拒，头受刀伤九处，持贼不放手，贼遂被擒。食堂粮未受损，成香之力也。
    头受刀伤九处多，食堂粮保不蹉跎。
    虽然年少担炊事，风格高于谢小娥。（注）
    拒贼勇如徐学惠，为人忠慕刘胡兰。
    弱龄农女无私念，应作青年榜样看。
  注：谢小娥是唐人传奇中所纪载的一个勇于和杀父杀夫的仇人作斗
    争的女子。
                              一九六○年八月十七日
