Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The Albanian representative to the United Nations and the Hungarian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sarka Károly, issued statements and notes, respectively, protesting the unreasonable restrictions imposed by the United States on the scope of activities of the head of the Albanian delegation, Shehu, and the head of the Hungarian delegation, Kádár, who were attending the Fifteenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. The statement by the Albanian representative to the United Nations stated that, in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the agreement concluded between the United States government and the United Nations regarding the location of the United Nations central institutions, the head of the Albanian delegation, Chairman of the Council of Ministers Shehu, should enjoy the rights enjoyed by the heads of delegations of other United Nations member states. The statement emphasized that the United States government bears full responsibility for the safety of Shehu during his stay in the United States.
    Hungarian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sarka Károly, in a note to the Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the US Embassy in Budapest, said that the note given to Hungary by the US delegation to the United Nations on September 10 was a brazen attack on the Hungarian people and government, an attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of the Hungarian People's Republic, and an intolerable discrimination against the delegation of the Hungarian People's Republic participating in the United Nations and its head. The note stated that the US government is attempting to use the slanders in the aforementioned note as an excuse to evade its responsibility for undermining its obligations to ensure the normal activities of the United Nations.
    The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs resolutely rejects the US government's slander against the Hungarian People's Republic and reminds the United States of the responsibility it bears for the current state of bilateral relations.

    就美国无理限制谢胡和卡达尔在美活动范围
    阿匈两国分别提出抗议
    新华社16日讯　阿尔巴尼亚驻联合国代表和匈牙利外交部副部长萨尔卡·卡罗伊就美国无理限制出席联合国大会第十五届会议的阿尔巴尼亚代表团长谢胡和匈牙利代表团长卡达尔的活动范围一事，分别发表声明和照会，表示抗议。阿尔巴尼亚驻联合国代表的声明说，根据联合国宪章和美国政府同联合国之间缔结的关于联合国中央机构所在地的协定，阿尔巴尼亚代表团长、部长会议主席谢胡应享有联合国成员其他各国代表团团长所享有的权利。声明强调指出，美国政府对谢胡在美国停留期间的安全应负全部责任。
    匈牙利外交部副部长萨尔卡·卡罗伊在给美国驻布达佩斯公使馆临时代办的一份照会中说，美国驻联合国的代表团在9月10日给匈牙利的照会是对匈牙利人民和政府的无耻攻击，是干涉匈牙利人民共和国内政的企图，是对匈牙利人民共和国参加联合国的代表团及其团长不可容忍的歧视。照会说，美国政府企图把在上述照会中的诽谤当作借口，来逃避它破坏它所承担的保证联合国正常活动的义务的责任。
    匈牙利外交部坚决拒绝美国政府对匈牙利人民共和国的诽谤，并提醒美国注意它对两国关系目前的状况所担负的责任。
