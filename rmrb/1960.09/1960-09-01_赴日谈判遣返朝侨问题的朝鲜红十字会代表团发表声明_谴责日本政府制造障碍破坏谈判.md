    The Korean Red Cross Delegation to Japan Issues Statement on Repatriation of Korean Residents, Condemning Japanese Government for Creating Obstacles and Undermining Negotiations
    Japanese Telecom Workers Demand Unconditional Extension of Agreement on Repatriation of Korean Residents
    (Combined reports from our newspaper)　Xinhua News Agency report: The talks between the Korean and Japanese Red Cross Societies regarding the extension of the agreement on the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan have stalled due to the Japanese government's unreasonable refusal to allow the Korean reporters accompanying the delegation to send news dispatches.
    The talks are being held in Niigata, Japan. The Korean Red Cross delegation, led by Vice Chairman of the Korean Red Cross Society, Li Il-kyung, arrived in Niigata on the 25th.
    Li Il-kyung stated at the welcoming reception that since the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan began last December, more than 36,000 Korean citizens have returned to the embrace of their beloved motherland and have begun new lives full of hope.
    However, there are still a large number of Korean citizens in Japan who are eagerly hoping to return to their motherland. In order to fully realize their legitimate and reasonable wishes, the term of the agreement on the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan must be extended unconditionally.
    On the 26th and 27th, only two preliminary talks were held in Niigata. On the morning of the 26th, representatives of the Korean and Japanese Red Cross Societies reached an agreement in the preliminary talks on the location for continuing the talks, and agreed that the agenda of the talks should be the extension of the agreement on the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan.
    However, the talks were immediately stalled because the Japanese side refused to allow the Korean reporters accompanying the delegation to send news dispatches back home reporting on the delegation's activities in Japan.
    As early as the 25th, the Korean delegation issued a protest statement regarding the incident in which the Japanese Foreign Ministry instructed the Niigata Telegraph Office to refuse to send news dispatches from Korean reporters. The statement pointed out that when the representatives of the Korean and Japanese Red Cross Societies negotiated in Pyongyang in 1955, the Korean government guaranteed the Japanese reporters accompanying the delegation the freedom to send news. It is unreasonable for the Japanese government to prohibit Korean reporters from sending news now.
    Because the Japanese government refused to change this unreasonable measure, the Korean representative issued a statement after the preliminary talks on the 27th, saying that formal talks could only be held if the Japanese side guaranteed the conditions for Korean reporters to engage in reporting activities on the talks. The statement pointed out that the Japanese side's restrictions on the reporting activities of Korean reporters accompanying the delegation are creating artificial obstacles, attempting to force the Korean side to accept unequal talks, making it difficult for the talks to proceed.
    This action by the Japanese government has also aroused indignation among people from all walks of life in Japan. According to reports, Matsui Katsushige, Deputy Director-General of the Japan-Korea Association, and other responsible persons visited the Japanese Foreign Ministry on the 26th to protest the Foreign Ministry's instructions to the telegraph office to refuse to send news dispatches from Korean reporters. Members of the Japanese Socialist Party in the Diet and Japanese trade unions also protested to the Foreign Ministry.
    Xinhua News Agency, August 30th: The Japan Congress of Journalists issued a statement on August 30th, condemning the Japanese government's act of prohibiting Korean reporters from sending news.
    The statement said: "We believe that the government should bear full responsibility for all obstacles preventing the exchange of reporters between Japan and Korea, and we strongly protest against the measures taken by the government to obstruct freedom of the press." The statement said: "We cannot but regard the government's disregard for international practice and suppression of the freedom of members of the delegation's press corps to send news dispatches as an attempt to create obstacles and undermine talks in the talks between Japan and Korea."
    Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: Tokyo news: The Niigata branch of the All Japan Telecommunication Workers' Union held a conference on the 27th, demanding that the Japanese side unconditionally extend the agreement on the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan.
    The conference passed a resolution saying that many Korean residents in Japan hope to return to their motherland, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Japanese side should allow them all to return. To this end, the repatriation agreement must be extended unconditionally.

    赴日谈判遣返朝侨问题的朝鲜红十字会代表团发表声明
    谴责日本政府制造障碍破坏谈判
    日本电信工人要求无条件延长遣送朝侨协定
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：朝鲜和日本红十字会之间关于延长遣送朝侨协定的会谈，由于日本政府无理拒绝朝方随团记者发新闻电讯而陷于停顿。
    这次会谈是在日本新澙举行的。由朝鲜红十字会副委员长李一卿率领的朝鲜红十字会代表团在25日到达新澙。
    李一卿在欢迎会上发表声明说，从去年12月旅日朝侨开始回国以来，已经有三万六千多名朝鲜公民回到他们亲爱的祖国的怀抱，满怀希望地开始了新的生活。
    但是，在日本仍有大批朝鲜公民迫切希望返回祖国。为了彻底实现他们的合情合理的愿望，遣送旅日朝侨协定的期限必须无条件地延长。
    26日和27日，双方在新澙只举行了两次预备会谈。26日上午，朝、日两国红十字会代表在预备会谈中，曾就继续会谈的地点达成协议，并且同意会谈的议程应当是延长遣送旅日朝鲜侨民回国的协定问题。
    可是，由于日本方面拒绝朝方随团记者发电讯回国报道代表团在日本的活动，会谈随即停顿。
    早在25日，朝鲜代表团已就日本外务省指令新澙电报局拒绝给朝鲜记者发新闻电报的事件发表抗议声明。声明指出，1955年朝日双方红十字会代表团在平壤谈判时，朝鲜政府保证了日本随团记者发新闻的自由。现在日本政府禁止朝鲜记者发新闻是毫无道理的。
    由于日本政府拒绝改变这种无理措施，朝方代表在27日的预备会谈后发表声明说，只有日方保证朝方记者从事会谈报道活动的条件，才能举行正式会谈。声明指出，日方限制朝方随团记者的采访活动是制造人为障碍，企图强迫朝方接受不平等的会谈，致使会谈难以进行。
    日本政府的这种行动，也引起了日本各界人士的愤慨。据报道，日朝协会副理事长松井胜重和其他负责人26日访问了日本外务省，抗议外务省指令电报局拒绝朝鲜记者发新闻电报。到外务省抗议的还有日本社会党国会议员和日本工会。
    据新华社讯　日本记者会议8月30日发表声明，谴责日本政府禁止朝鲜记者发新闻电的行为。
    声明说：“我们认为政府要对阻止日本和朝鲜交换记者的一切障碍负完全责任，我们对政府采取的妨害新闻自由的措施提出强烈的抗议。声明说：“我们不能不把政府漠视国际惯例、压制代表团的报界成员发新闻电报的自由的作法，看作是企图在日本和朝鲜的会谈中制造障碍和破坏会谈。”
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本全国电气通信工会新澙分会27日举行大会，要求日本方面无条件延长遣送旅日朝侨归国协定。
    大会通过决议说，很多旅日朝侨希望回到他们的祖国朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，日方应该让他们都能够回去，为此必须无条件地延长遣侨协定。
