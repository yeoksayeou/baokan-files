Deep Plowing Greatly Promotes Wheat Yield Increase
Ma Tongyi, Deputy Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of Pohu Commune, and Special Researcher of the Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences

Last year, in Pohu Commune, Changge County, Henan Province, we universally implemented deep plowing before sowing wheat, and achieved significant yield increases. My eight mu of experimental wheat fields were plowed to a depth of one chi two cun (1.2 Chinese feet), combined with applying base fertilizer and watering the soil to settle it. By adopting high-quality seeds, close planting, and other technical measures, we achieved a high yield of 823 jin per mu.

Deep plowing has a significant effect. It can loosen the soil, reduce soil bulk density, increase soil porosity, and improve soil aeration, which in turn improves the soil's ability to store water and retain fertilizer. Our measurements show that: the bulk density of soil tilled to a shallow depth of six cun (0.6 Chinese feet) is 1.431 grams per milliliter, the total porosity is 45.1%, and the maximum water-holding capacity is 28.6%; the bulk density of soil tilled to a depth of one chi (1 Chinese foot) is 1.298 grams, the total porosity is 50%, and the maximum water-holding capacity is 32.8%; the bulk density of soil tilled to a depth of one chi five cun (1.5 Chinese feet) is 1.278 grams, the total porosity is 49.8%, and the maximum water-holding capacity is 33.1%.

Deep plowing can increase the moisture content of the soil. Appropriately increasing the soil moisture content is very beneficial for wheat growth.

Deep plowing regulates the moisture and air conditions in the soil, which is beneficial to the activity and reproduction of microorganisms. It can transform the slow-release nutrients in the soil into readily available nutrients, and also regulate the soil temperature. According to measurements, the soil temperature of land that is deeply plowed to a depth of one chi (1 Chinese foot) in winter is about 2 degrees Celsius higher than that of land that is shallowly plowed to a depth of six cun (0.6 Chinese feet); the soil temperature of land that is deeply plowed to a depth of one chi (1 Chinese foot) in early summer (early May) is about 6 degrees Celsius lower than that of land that is shallowly plowed to a depth of six cun (0.6 Chinese feet). The reduced range of temperature variation is also beneficial to wheat growth.

Deep plowing loosens the soil, accelerates soil ripening, and increases soil nutrients and moisture content, which is very beneficial to the growth and development of wheat roots. The better the root system develops, the more sufficient nutrients and water can be transported to the plant.

The depth of deep plowing should be determined according to the depth of the densely distributed part of the crop's root system. The distribution of wheat roots is mostly concentrated in the soil layer of one chi two cun (1.2 Chinese feet) to one chi five cun (1.5 Chinese feet) or more. Therefore, deep plowing to a depth of one chi (1 Chinese foot) to one chi five cun (1.5 Chinese feet) has a significant yield-increasing effect. As for the number of years of deep plowing, according to our experiments: the yield of wheat per mu on land deep-plowed in 1957 was 556 jin, the yield of wheat per mu in 1958 was 586 jin, and the yield of wheat per mu in 1959 was 595 jin. It can be seen that under the same cultivation conditions, the yield increase in the second year of deep plowing is larger, and there is still an increase in the third year, but the increase is not as large. We believe that deep plowing every other year for four years is more appropriate.

There are two methods of deep plowing: one is "front plow, rear set"; the other is "two plows, one harrow, and one roller." Both of these methods can achieve a deep plowing depth of eight cun (0.8 Chinese feet) to one chi two cun (1.2 Chinese feet). The former method is simple and easy to implement, and the masses are accustomed to it; the latter method plows deeper and has higher quality, and a large amount of fertilizer can be applied. Regardless of which method and tool are used for deep plowing, attention should be paid to maintaining the soil layers in order. If the soil layers are disrupted, it will affect the normal growth of crops and cause yield reduction.

Deep plowing must be combined with increasing the application of base fertilizer to improve soil structure and increase soil fertility; deep plowing must also be combined with watering the soil to settle it, so that the loose soil becomes firm and prevents excessive soil voids, resulting in moisture loss and affecting crop growth. Soil that is firm and has sufficient moisture can better integrate soil and fertilizer, increasing soil nutrients. In addition, deep plowing must also be closely coordinated with the selection of high-quality seeds, rational close planting, and other yield-increasing measures to make wheat yields even higher.

### 深耕对小麦增产作用大

    深耕对小麦增产作用大	中共坡胡公社委员会副书记	河南省农业科学院特约研究员　马同义
    去年我们河南长葛县坡胡公社的小麦在播种前普遍实行了深耕，收到了显著增产的效果。我种的八亩小麦试验田，深耕一尺二寸，结合施底肥和浇塌地水，采取良种、密植等各项技术措施，获得了亩产八百二十三斤的高额丰产。
    深耕的作用很大，它能疏松土壤，减轻土壤容重，增加土壤的孔隙，提高土壤的通气性，也就提高了土壤的蓄水保肥能力。我们测定的结果是：浅耕六寸的土壤容重每毫升为一点四三一克，总孔隙率为45.1％，最大持水量为28.6％；深耕一尺的土壤容重为一点二九八克，总孔隙率为50％，最大持水量为32.8％；深耕一尺五寸的土壤容重为一点二七八克，总孔隙率为49.8％，最大持水量为33.1％。
    深耕能够提高土壤的含水量。适当提高土壤含水量，对小麦生长很有利。
    深耕调节了土壤中的水分和空气的状况，有益于微生物的活动和繁殖，能使土壤中的迟效性的养分转化为速效养分；并能调节土壤的温度。据测定，冬季深耕一尺的地温比浅耕六寸的地温提高摄氏二度左右；初夏（5月初）深耕一尺的地温比浅耕六寸的地温下降摄氏六度。地温的变幅缩小，也有利于小麦的生长。
    深耕疏松了土壤，加速了土壤熟化，提高了土壤的养分和含水量，对小麦根系的生长发育很有利。根系发育越好，越能给植株输送充足的养分和水分。
    深耕的深度，应根据作物根系密集的部位的深度来决定。小麦根系的分布，多集中在一尺二寸到一尺五寸以上的土层中。因此，深耕一尺到一尺五寸增产效果显著。深耕的年限，根据我们的试验：1957年深翻的土地亩产小麦五百五十六斤，1958年亩产小麦五百八十六斤，1959年亩产小麦五百九十五斤。可以看出，在同样的栽培条件下，深耕第二年增产幅度较大，第三年仍然增产，但增产幅度已不大了。我们认为四年两头深耕比较适宜。
    深耕的方法有两种：一是前犁后套；一是二犁、一?、一串。这两种方法深耕的深度都可以达到八寸至一尺二寸。前一种方法，简单易行，群众习惯；后一种方法耕的深，质量高，可以大量施肥。不管采用什么方法和工具深耕，都要注意保持土层不乱。如果打乱土壤层次，会影响作物正常生长，造成减产。
    深耕必须结合增施底肥，改良土壤结构，增加土壤肥力；深耕还要结合浇塌地水，使虚土塌实，防止土壤空隙过大，造成断墒，影响作物生长。塌实的土壤有了充足的水分，可以使土壤和肥料更好地溶合，增加土壤养分。另外，深耕还必须和选用良种，合理密植等各种增产措施密切配合，才能使小麦高产更高产。
