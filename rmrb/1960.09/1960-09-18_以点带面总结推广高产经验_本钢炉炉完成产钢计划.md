Xinhua News Agency, Benxi Telegram – Leading cadres of Benxi Steel Plant went deep into the steelmaking furnaces. Utilizing leadership methods that focused on key points and combined them with overall efforts, they summarized the high-yield experience of Li Shaoxian's team. They mobilized the masses to launch a competition, enabling the entire plant to comprehensively complete the steel production plan every day, every shift, and for every furnace.

On August 29th, Li Shaoxian's team on Furnace No. 2 of this plant created a high-yield record of producing four heats of steel per shift. Factory Director Hao Zhenhua and Deputy Party Secretary Zhao Jichun immediately led a work team to help them summarize their experience overnight. In promoting the high-yield experience of Li Shaoxian's team, the plant's Party committee did a great deal of meticulous ideological and organizational work.

On August 31st, the entire plant vigorously publicized the high-yield experience of Li Shaoxian's team. That evening, mobilization rallies were held in the first steelmaking workshop for Party members, Youth League members, production activists, and workers, immediately launching a "learn, compare, catch up, and help" competition using Li Shaoxian's team as a model. On September 1st, after Pan Yongmao's team on Furnace No. 4 took over their shift, they heard that Zhao Jiying's team in the first shift had produced a heat of steel in two hours and twenty-seven minutes, approaching the level of the advanced team. They then tried everything possible to produce a heat of steel in two hours and twenty minutes. Jia Qujun's team in the third shift also worked hard to catch up with the previous shift, and as a result, they produced a heat of steel in two hours, surpassing Li Shaoxian's team in one fell swoop.

The plant's leading cadres not only focused on the advanced but also vigorously helped the backward units catch up. In order to help Zhang Guoheng's group on Furnace No. 1 achieve a target of four heats of steel per shift, leading cadres invited workers from Li Shaoxian's team to share their experiences on the evening of September 1st. The secretary and the factory director also participated in the labor themselves, and as a result, the group produced a heat of steel in just one hour and thirty-nine minutes, breaking the plant's record. This victory greatly encouraged the plant's workers. By September 6th, all the furnaces in the entire workshop had successively created records of producing four heats of steel per shift, catching up with the advanced production level of Li Shaoxian's team.

    以点带面总结推广高产经验
    本钢炉炉完成产钢计划
    新华社本溪电　本溪钢厂主要领导干部深入炼钢炉边，运用以点带面、点面结合的领导方法，总结出李绍先班高产经验，发动群众开展竞赛，使全厂天天、班班、炉炉都全面完成产钢计划。
    8月29日，这个厂二号炉李绍先班创造了班产四炉钢的高产纪录。厂长郝振华、党委副书记赵纪春，马上带领一个工作组，连夜帮助他们总结经验。在推广李绍先班的高产经验中，厂党委作了许多细致的思想工作和组织工作。
    8月31日，全厂大力宣传李绍先班的高产经验。当晚，在第一炼钢车间里还分别召开了党团员、生产积极分子和职工誓师比武大会，立即掀起了以李绍先班为样板的“学、比、赶、帮”的竞赛。9月1日，四号炉二班潘永茂班上班后，听说头班赵继英班用了二时二十七分钟炼出一炉钢，接近了先进班水平，就千方百计地用了二时二十分钟炼出一炉钢。三班贾躯俊班为赶上一班也奋勇直追，结果两小时就炼出一炉钢，一举超过了李绍先班。
    这个厂的领导干部不仅抓先进，还大力帮助后进单位赶上先进。为帮助一号炉张国恒小组达到班产四炉钢，9月1日晚间，领导干部把李绍先班工人请来传经献宝，书记和厂长自己也参加劳动，结果使这个小组只用一小时三十九分钟就炼出一炉钢，打破了全厂纪录。这一胜利，极大地振奋了全厂职工，到9月6日，全车间所有炉子都接二连三地创造了班产四炉钢的纪录，赶上了李绍先班的先进生产水平。
