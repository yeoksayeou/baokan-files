Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 12th: Seoul dispatch: The South Korean people are continuing their heroic persistence in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. From September 1st to 10th, according to incomplete statistics, in the areas of Seoul, Daegu, Daejeon, Cheongju, Gwangju, and Tongyeong County alone, there have been fourteen instances of various struggles, including worker strikes, student demonstrations, teachers dispersing reactionary meetings, farmer demonstrations, fishermen demanding the return of fishing rights, bereaved families rushing into puppet "courts," and artistic groups protesting fascist laws.

The South Korean people deeply resent U.S. imperialism's aggressive dumping of goods in South Korea. On September 1st, 1,400 students from Cheongju Commercial High School in North Chungcheong Province, chanting slogans such as "Resist American goods, establish an independent economy," held a demonstration. They distributed leaflets on the streets, calling on the people not to buy American goods. According to reports, American goods dominate the South Korean market, crowding out the sales of South Korean-made products. The amount of American cigarettes imported into South Korea alone reaches 6.5 billion won annually.

According to the South Korean News Agency, more than 100 family members of those killed in the anti-American and anti-Syngman Rhee uprising in Seoul this April held demonstrations in front of the puppet "National Assembly" and puppet "court" office buildings for two consecutive days on the 5th and 6th. They shouted slogans, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' new puppet Chang Myon clique in South Korea for shielding the murderers who slaughtered the people of the Seoul uprising. According to reports, on the morning of the 6th, when the bereaved families demonstrated on Taiping Road in Seoul, vehicular traffic was cut off. Around 4:00 PM, the bereaved families, holding up banners, broke through the guard line at the main entrance of the puppet "court" and rushed into the court, ascending to the second floor of the puppet "court" office building. Subsequently, they rushed into the lawyers' association, severely reprimanding the bullying lawyers, and on the spot, they forced the two reactionary lawyers, Lee Young-guk and Song Do-young, who were hiding in the lawyers' association, to write their resignations.

According to Donghwa News Agency, more than 1,000 students from Gwangju Agricultural University and Gwangju Agricultural High School, along with many citizens, including farmers from the suburbs, held a rally and demonstration on the 7th to oppose the puppet government's anti-people agricultural policies. They held up banners with slogans such as "Remind the government, the flames of the peasant revolution have risen!" and demonstrated in formation on the streets, constantly chanting slogans and distributing leaflets. At the rally, the demonstrators condemned the reactionary agricultural policies formulated by U.S. imperialism and the puppet clique for the purpose of exploitation and plunder.

According to South Korea's "Industrial Economic News," more than 200 fishermen from Chudo, Sanyang Township, Tongyeong County, South Gyeongsang Province, sailed in sailboats to the Tongyeong County government seat, about 50 li away from Chudo, and held a five-hour street demonstration. They shouted, "Give us fishermen fishing rights!" demanding that the puppet government return the fishing grounds seized from the fishermen.

It is also reported that on September 6th, the South Korean "Drama Council" and two other artistic groups jointly issued a statement condemning the Chang Myon clique's attempts to restrict the free activities of stage artists. The statement pointed out that the directive issued by the Chang Myon clique on September 2nd, forcing stage art groups to "register" and illegally suppressing creative activities, must be revoked immediately.

According to a broadcast by Daegu Radio, the National Committee of the South Korean Teachers and Staff Union presented the puppet government with four conditions on the morning of the 4th, demanding that it immediately stop the conspiracy to dissolve the teachers and staff union, and demanded that the puppet government respond before 5:00 PM on September 13th; otherwise, a nationwide struggle would be launched. On the day before this—the 3rd—a group of reactionary elements under the jurisdiction of the puppet "Korean Education Federation" were holding a meeting in Daegu. Members of the teachers and staff union, upon hearing the news, rushed into the meeting place and dispersed this group of reactionary elements.

Workers in cigarette factories, printing factories, and employees of the "Korea-Japan Bank" in Seoul, Daegu, Daejeon, and other places have successively launched strikes these days, demanding freedom, democracy, survival rights, and higher wages.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 14th: Seoul dispatch: More than 1,500 students from Yonsei University in Seoul held a rally on the morning of the 13th, demanding that the acting president, American Won Il-han (real name Underwood), immediately resign and step down.

According to Donghwa News Agency, at the meeting, the students put forward five conditions: 1. Won Il-han should resign immediately, and a Korean should be appointed as president; 2. The reactionary school board should be immediately reorganized; 3. Professors who flatter and have no conscience should be immediately expelled; 4. A plan to reorganize the school structure should be implemented immediately; 5. Illegally dismissed professors should be reinstated.

The students of this university also decided to go on strike starting from the 14th, and announced that if their five conditions were not met before 10:00 AM on the 15th, they would "take forceful action to carry out the struggle."

    据同和通讯社报道，光州农业大学、光州农业高等学校的一千多名学生和包括郊区农民在内的许多市民，在7日举行大会和示威，反对傀儡政府的反人民的农业政策。他们高举着写有“提醒政府，农民革命的烽火起来了！”等口号的标语牌，在大街上列队示威，并且不断地高呼口号和散发传单。示威群众在大会上，谴责由美帝国主义和傀儡集团制订的以剥削和掠夺为目的的反动的农业政策。
    据南朝鲜“产业经济新闻”报道，庆尚南道统营郡山阳面楸岛的二百多名渔民，乘帆船赶到离楸岛约五十里路的统营郡政府所在地，举行了五小时的街头示威。他们高呼“给我们渔民渔业权！”，要求傀儡政府把强占去的渔场还给渔民。
    另据报道，9月6日，南朝鲜“戏剧协议会”和另外两个艺术团体联合发表声明，谴责张勉集团企图限制舞台艺术工作者的自由活动的行为。声明指出，张勉集团9月2日发布的强迫舞台艺术团体“登记”、非法压制创作活动的指令，必须立即撤销。
    据大丘广播电台广播，南朝鲜教员工会全国委员会4日上午向傀儡政府提出立即停止解散教员工会的阴谋活动的四项条件，叫傀儡政府在9月13日下午五点以前答复；如果不答复便展开全国性的斗争。在这前一天——3日那天，伪“大韩教育联合会”管辖下的一群反动分子正在大丘开会，教员工会的会员闻讯后冲进会场，冲散了这群反动分子。
    汉城、大丘、大田等地卷烟厂的工人、印刷厂的工人以及“韩日银行”的职工，这几天接连举行罢工，要求自由、民主和生存权利和提高工资。
    新华社平壤14日电　汉城消息：汉城市延世大学一千五百多名学生，13日上午举行大会，要求代理校长、美国人元日汉（本名恩德乌德）立即辞职下台。
