Xinhua News Agency, Havana, September 9th: Cuban Prime Minister Castro warned at the closing meeting of the special congress of the Shoe Workers' Union this morning that US imperialism has not ceased its activities against the Cuban Revolution. He said that recently the Revolutionary Army arrested a small group of counter-revolutionary bandits who were carrying out orders from foreign intelligence agencies operating behind the scenes to launch a rebellion in the mountains of Las Villas Province.

Castro pointed out that the conspiracy of US imperialism has been frustrated and will continue to be frustrated in the future, because it does not have the support of the people. The Prime Minister went on to say that the attacks on the Cuban Revolution are due to the fear that Cuba's example will promote revolution in Latin America. He cited as an example that the revolutionary policies have reduced the unemployment left over by the dictatorship by 35%.

Speaking of the importance of the task set by the government to eliminate illiteracy within one year, Castro said that soon 1,500 volunteer teachers would go to the mountains to help farmers learn to read. He said that publishing houses will publish a large number of literacy textbooks and works that tell of the people's struggle against imperialist oppressors. These books will be supplied cheaply to the market, and 50,000 libraries will be established across the country.

Castro said, "We hope that our welfare undertakings will be victorious. And our victory will be the misfortune of the enemies of mankind."

Xinhua News Agency, September 11th: The Chilean National Movement for Support and Defense of the Cuban Revolution, composed of well-known Chilean figures, issued a public statement condemning the United States for forcing the "Declaration of San José" through the Organization of American States Foreign Ministers' Conference in order to suppress Cuba.

The statement said that the resolution passed by the Foreign Ministers' Conference against the Soviet Union providing support to the Cuban government and people means infringing on the legitimate right of small nations to self-defense, and plotting to hand over Martí's homeland to greedy imperialist monopolies. The statement expressed support for the speech by Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa at the conference condemning US aggression, and considered that this speech revealed the truth of the diplomatic history of Latin American countries.

The statement put forward a proposal to immediately convene a conference of representatives of the peoples of Latin American countries. The statement said that this is to counter the alliance of reactionary governments and to mobilize all truly popular democratic and progressive forces to defend the Cuban Revolution and support the liberation of Latin American countries. The Chilean National Movement for Support and Defense of the Cuban Revolution stated in the declaration its full support for the Havana Declaration approved by the Cuban people and government on the historic day of September 2.

The statement concluded by saying that in many Latin American countries, the censorship of printed materials and the cutting off of communication links from Cuba is an infringement of the Declaration of Human Rights. The statement protested the anti-Cuban propaganda carried out by reactionary Chilean newspapers and called on the people to mobilize to oppose aggression and defend the guarantee of democracy.

The Venezuelan newspaper "People's Forum" published the Havana Declaration passed by the Cuban People's National Congress in a supplement on the 9th, and published pictures related to the conference. The newspaper commented that this statement is a document of independence for the peoples of Latin American countries.

In the Venezuelan cities of Coro, Barquisimeto, and Mérida, demonstrations in support of Cuba have recently been held. After marching on the streets, university students in Mérida held a mass rally in the central building of the local university. Banners hung at the rally site bore the slogan "Here, Defend Cuba."

    卡斯特罗在古巴鞋业工联代表大会上说
    美帝国主义颠覆阴谋必将失败
    智利委内端拉公众支持哈瓦那宣言反对美国干涉古巴
    新华社哈瓦那9日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗今天清晨在鞋业工人联合会特别代表大会的闭幕会议上警告说，美帝国主义并没有停止反对古巴革命的活动。他说，最近起义军逮捕了一小股反革命匪帮，他们执行在幕后牵线的外国间谍机关的命令，在拉斯维利亚斯省的山区发动了叛乱。
    卡斯特罗指出，美帝国主义的阴谋遭到了挫折，今后仍将遭到挫折，因为它没有人民的支持。这位总理接着说，对古巴革命的攻击是由于害怕古巴的范例会促进拉丁美洲的革命。他举例说，革命的政策使独裁政权遗留下来的失业人口减少了35％。
    卡斯特罗在谈到政府所规定的在一年之内消灭文盲的这件任务的重要性时说，不久，将有一千五百名志愿教师去山区帮助农民识字。他说，出版社将出版大量的识字课本和讲述人民反对帝国主义压迫者的斗争的作品。这些书籍将廉价供应市场，并且将在全国建立起五万个图书馆来。
    卡斯特罗说，“我们希望我们的福利事业取得胜利。而我们的胜利将是人类敌人的不幸”。
    新华社11日讯　由智利知名人士组成的智利全国支援和保卫古巴革命运动发表了一项公开声明，谴责美国为了镇压古巴而强使美洲国家组织外长会议通过的“圣约瑟宣言”。
    声明说，外长会议通过反对苏联向古巴政府和人民提供支持的决议，意味着侵犯弱小民族自卫的合法权利，而策谋将马蒂的祖国交给贪得无厌的帝国主义垄断组织。声明表示支持古巴外长劳尔·罗亚在会上谴责美国侵略的发言，认为这个发言揭示了拉丁美洲各国外交史上的真相。
    声明提出立即召开拉丁美洲各国人民代表大会的建议。声明说，这是为了对抗反动政府的联合，和动员一切真正的人民民主和进步的力量，来保卫古巴革命和支持拉丁美洲各国的解放。智利全国支援和保卫古巴革命运动在声明中表示完全支持古巴人民和政府在历史性的日子——9月2日批准的哈瓦那宣言。
    声明最后说，在许多拉丁美洲国家里，检查印刷品，切断来自古巴的通讯联络，这种情况侵犯了人权宣言。声明抗议智利反动报刊进行的反古巴的宣传，并号召人民动员起来，反对侵略，保卫对民主的保证。
    委内瑞拉“人民论坛报”9日在增刊上发表了古巴人民全国大会通过的哈瓦那宣言，并刊登了有关这次大会的图片。报纸评论说，这个声明是拉丁美洲各国人民独立的文献。
    在委内瑞拉的科罗、巴圭西美托和美利达等城市，最近又举行了支持古巴的示威游行。美利达城的大学生在大街上游行以后，在当地大学的中央大楼举行了群众集会，集会场所挂着的横幅标语上写着“这里，保卫古巴”的口号。
