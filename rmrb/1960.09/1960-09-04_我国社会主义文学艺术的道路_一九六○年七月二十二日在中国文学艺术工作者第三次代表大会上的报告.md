The Third National Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Circles opened today. From the Second Congress held in September 1953 to now, nearly seven years have passed. From the First Congress held in July 1949, eleven years have gone by. In the span of ten years, which is but a moment in human history, our country and the world have undergone tremendous changes.

Our people have achieved great victories in the democratic and socialist revolutions and are now, under the guidance and inspiration of the Party's general line for building socialism, creating magnificent achievements in industrial and agricultural production and other fronts. New things are emerging across the land. Socialist economic construction is advancing at an unprecedented speed, and rural and urban people's communes are rising like the sun in the east. Tens of millions of people are engaged in the fervent movements of technological and cultural revolutions. The spiritual face of the people has undergone profound changes. Comrade Mao Zedong has aptly described the Chinese people during the Great Leap Forward as "spiritually vibrant, full of vigor and vitality, and with high morale." The heroic spirit displayed by our people in revolutionary struggles and productive labor, their sublime ideals and moral qualities, have won the admiration of progressive people all over the world. China is gradually changing its face of poverty and backwardness, standing tall in the world with a magnificent revolutionary posture and youthful vigor.

The people of the socialist camp, led by the Soviet Union, are advancing by leaps and bounds in their socialist construction. The strength of the socialist camp, the awakening, unity, and struggle of the world's people, form a powerful bulwark against imperialism and for the maintenance of world peace. The imperialist camp, led by the United States, is further declining and decaying. The war and aggression policies of American imperialism are facing increasing opposition from more and more people around the world. A Cuban revolutionary poet wrote these lines:

People of Cuba! Learn this English phrase,
To shout:
Get out, Americans!

These angry lines represent the voice of all peoples oppressed by American imperialism. The national liberation and democratic revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging. The victory of the Cuban people's revolution, the brave anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people, the Algerian people's fight for national independence, the Congolese people's resistance against colonialism, the overthrow of traitorous dictators in South Korea and Turkey, have greatly inspired the world, dispelled many people's fear of imperialism, and encouraged the world's people to fight against imperialism. In imperialist countries, the broad masses are fighting against monopoly capital, against fascism, for democracy, freedom, and social progress. The struggle to oppose imperialist war forces and defend world peace, involving the broadest strata, has entered a new upsurge. The time for the oppressed peoples of the world to completely shatter the chains of imperialism and colonialism has arrived. The day when imperialism is finally eliminated from the earth is not far off. The excellent system of socialism and the beautiful ideal of communism are attracting more and more people around the world.

Literature and art are part of the superstructure, a form of ideology, a reflection of the economic base, and the nerve center of class struggle. In imperialist countries, one sees a horrifying scene of spiritual collapse and moral degradation. This scene is also reflected in the literary and artistic works of these countries. At the 13th Cannes International Film Festival held in France in May this year, the films from several major capitalist countries were almost without exception a mixture of obscenity, debauchery, and criminal behavior. Even bourgeois critics could not help but lament, "This is the most shameless film festival in history." This is a reflection of the decay and decline of the capitalist world. Monopoly capitalists not only make the literature, films, and art works produced under their control into narcotics that corrupt and poison human souls, but also through their hired writers create many nakedly inciting works of invasion, colonial rule, and racial discrimination, directly serving the imperialist war forces. In West Germany and Japan, with the revival of fascism and militarism, works praising Nazi war criminals and advocating the "spirit of the great Japanese nation" are emerging one after another. In the so-called "free world," many bourgeois writers and artists are mired in inextricable spiritual anguish; some see the end of capitalism as the end of the world and are therefore fearful and anxious, despairing of human destiny; some wander between capitalism and socialism; some gradually break through the barriers of bourgeois worldviews and various prejudices, turning towards the people and the side of socialism.

Progressive and revolutionary artists in capitalist countries have faced various forms of exclusion and persecution; they tenaciously continue their struggles, creating many outstanding works reflecting the will of the people to advance. Many writers and artists from various countries who love peace have actively participated in the movement to defend world peace. In places where national and democratic revolutionary storms have risen, revolutionary writers and artists stand at the forefront of the struggle, sharing the fate of the people, truly expressing the people's desire for liberation. We hereby express our highest respect to all artists who sincerely struggle for peace, democracy, national independence, and human progress.

Our socialist literature and art are irreconcilable with those serving imperialism and reactionaries. In contrast to the decadent and declining literature and art of capitalism, our literature and art are revolutionary and vibrant, inspiring the laboring people to transform the world and engage in revolutionary struggles. This literature and art depicts a vast world of the people, expresses the great struggles of the laboring masses, reflects the prosperity of the new socialist world, and reflects the birth and growth of new communist people.

The modern revisionists, represented by the Tito clique in Yugoslavia, distort the correct principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, vigorously advocating so-called "positive coexistence," denying the opposition between the socialist camp and the imperialist camp, advocating the mutual infiltration and fusion of socialist and capitalist ideologies, and trying every means to disintegrate the socialist camp ideologically and politically. For this purpose, revisionists, in collaboration with the propaganda organs of imperialism, peddle capitalist decadent culture and lifestyles everywhere, vigorously encouraging various anti-Marxist, anti-socialist, and anti-people currents in the intellectual and artistic circles of socialist countries. On the literary and artistic front, the struggle between socialist countries and imperialist countries, between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between progressive forces and reactionary forces, is extremely fierce.

Revolutionary literature and art serve revolutionary politics, and reactionary literature and art serve reactionary politics. Once revolutionary artists deviate from the people's revolutionary cause, regardless of what banner they raise, they will lose their way, take the wrong path, and even become reactionary.

The current political task of our people is to build our country into a socialist power with modern industry, agriculture, and science and culture as quickly as possible, under the conditions allowed by objective circumstances, and to prepare the conditions to enter the communist society in the future; at the same time, together with the people of socialist countries and all revolutionary and peace-loving people in the world, to make the greatest efforts to oppose imperialism and strive for lasting world peace. On the ideological front, we should raise the banner of Marxism-Leninism even higher, oppose the reactionary currents of modern revisionism, and through long-term, unremitting struggles, thoroughly eliminate the political and ideological influences of the bourgeoisie among the people, greatly enhance the people's communist ideological awareness and moral qualities. Our literature and art should become a sharp weapon to educate the people with socialist and communist spirits and proletarian internationalism.

Revolutionary artists should stand at the forefront of the people's revolutionary struggles and at the forefront of the times.

Since the First and Second Congresses of Literature and Art Workers, especially since the Great Leap Forward, our literary and artistic work has achieved extremely significant results and accumulated extremely rich experience. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, we have found the correct path for the development of socialist literature and art. At this Congress, we should sum up our experiences well, explain how our literature and art have developed; explain the direction and path our socialist literature and art should take to be correct, to be beneficial to the cause of socialism and communism, and to the development of socialist literature and art itself; explain how the proletarian line and the bourgeois line, the communist worldview and the bourgeois worldview, are engaged in sharp struggles in our literary and artistic circles. These are the main issues we need to discuss at this Congress.

Our literature and art serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve the cause of socialism. Since Comrade Mao Zedong's famous speech "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in 1942, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers has always been the unshakable direction supported and followed by our revolutionary literary and artistic workers. The achievements we have made in literary and artistic work are the victories of the direction of literature and art proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong, which are also the victories of Marxist-Leninist literary thought.

In our country, the working people have become the masters of the state. They have overthrown the oppressors and exploiters, abolished the private ownership of the means of production, and those who used to live by exploitation are also being transformed into self-reliant laborers. Former individual peasants and individual handicraftsmen, through the path of cooperatives and people's communes, have all become collective peasants and collective handicraftsmen. If literature and art do not serve the working people and their intellectuals, then whom do they serve? Would we still serve the landlord class and the bourgeoisie? If not the working people, then who else is worthy of our depiction today? The direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers has opened up a new world for literature and art, enabling writers and artists to find new themes, new subjects, and new service objects. This is the direction of human literary development, a great revolution in literature and art.

Serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers today means serving the great socialist construction being carried out by tens of millions of people, serving the Party's general line, serving the great tomorrow of communism; it means serving the noble cause of opposing imperialism and striving for lasting world peace; it means depicting the great achievements of our people in revolutionary and construction struggles, their spirit of hard struggle, and their sublime communist qualities; it means cooperating with the technological and cultural revolutions of the masses, thoroughly breaking the monopoly of a few people over literature and art, making literature and art acceptable and usable by the broadest masses of workers and peasants.

Literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers is the most thorough and resolute proletarian literary direction, which is diametrically opposed to the bourgeois literary direction. Therefore, it has been opposed and hated by all domestic and foreign reactionaries and revisionists. Hu Feng called it a "knife"; the Yugoslav revisionists cursed it as "persecution" of writers. This is not surprising at all. Because they hate the working class and hate the revolution. In the eyes of bourgeois literati, literature is the exclusive property of a few "superior" people, their private property; in their view, literature should only sing the praises of the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals, beautify the decadent life of the bourgeoisie, and propagate bourgeois individualist thoughts and vulgar tastes. They are "literary aristocrats," how can they be willing to depict the workers and peasants, how can they be willing to serve the workers and peasants? Therefore, to develop socialist literature and art, it is inevitable to engage in unending struggles against bourgeois ideology. Starting from the criticism of the film "Wu Xun's Biography" in 1951, through the criticism of "Research on Dream of the Red Chamber," the criticism of Hu Shi and Hu Feng's thoughts, and the exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, to the struggle against the Ding Ling, Chen Qingxian anti-Party clique and other rightist elements in 1957, and then the criticism of the revisionist literary trend. The series of struggles on the literary and artistic front are the reflections of class struggles in the ideological realm during the period of socialist revolution and construction in our country. If the criticism of "Wu Xun's Biography" was the first shot fired at bourgeois ideology in the literary field after the founding of the nation, then the struggle against rightist elements in the literary circles was a decisive battle between the two lines and two worldviews on the literary and artistic front.

The bourgeois rightists and revisionists always try to transform our literature and art according to their worldviews and aesthetics, trying to pull our literature and art onto the capitalist path. To clear the way for the advancement of socialist literature and art, it is inevitable to engage in long-term, repeated struggles against bourgeois ideology. This is the law of development for socialist literature and art. Through these struggles, our literature and art have not "withered" as some reactionary literati claimed, but have become even more robust. Now, everyone can see that our literature and art are advancing rapidly along the socialist track.

In our country, literature and art are no longer the exclusive property of a few people but have become a common cause of the broad masses of various nationalities. Revolutionary literature, drama, film, and other forms of art have deeply entered the hearts of the people. Many new literary works have sold tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of copies. In 1959, the number of film viewers reached 4.1 billion. Various new performances of drama, spoken drama, new operas, music, dance, storytelling, and acrobatics are increasingly attracting a wide audience and listeners. Artworks are appreciated by the broad masses, and comic strips are printed in millions of copies each year. The laboring masses feel that literature and art truly serve them, reflecting their thoughts, emotions, and aspirations, and are "life textbooks" that inspire them to work and struggle and improve their moral qualities. Workers, peasants, and soldiers themselves actively participate in the creation of literature and art; amateur artistic activities and amateur writing movements in factories, rural areas, and the army have been widely carried out. Many nameless workers and peasants' talented creations and outstanding works by literary and artistic specialists shine together. Literature and art have never been as important in people's lives as they are now, playing such an important role, and being so valued by the people. The relationship between literature and art and the laboring people has changed, and the nature of literature and art itself has changed; our literature and art have gradually become the literature and art of the laboring people.

A strong and distinct revolutionary spirit and fighting spirit are the most distinctive features of our literature and art. Artists, as the drummers of the times, use various forms of art to keenly reflect the struggles of our people against imperialism, to defend the motherland and world peace, to reflect the new people and new things emerging on various fronts of national construction, to enthusiastically depict the growth of new things in struggles, and to show the active role of literature and art in closely cooperating with politics. Many outstanding works have broadly depicted and artistically summarized our people's revolutionary history and current struggles. "The Red Flag," "Song of Youth," "Three Families Lane," "Lingquan Cave," "Bitter Herbs," "Railway Guerrillas," "Red Sun," "Forest of Fire and Snow," "Three Bay," "Great Changes in a Mountain Village," "The Creation of History," "Grassland Conflagration," "Dawn by the River," "Happiness in Battle," and other novels, "The Story of Yang and Gao," "The Story of the Coachman," "The Turbulent Years," and other long narrative poems, "Ten Thousand Mountains and Rivers," "Red Storm," "Long Live the Heroes," "The March to the East," "The Village of Locust Trees," and other dramas, "The Battle of Shangganling," "Lin Zexu," "Storm," "Nie Er," "Song of Youth," "Dong Cunrui," "Youth in Battle," and other films, have presented the history of our people's earth-shaking revolutionary struggles from the Opium War to the socialist revolution.

The advanced figures among the workers and peasants have become the main protagonists in our literary works. In many outstanding novels, films, dramas, paintings, and other forms of art, the heroic images of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals have been created. Writers and artists have fused their ideals into the creation of heroic characters, expressing new worlds, new characters, and new ideas in their artworks. From the recent creations, one can see a clear trend: writers depict the revolutionary spirit and magnificent aspirations of the people to transform the world more vividly and deeply, and the portrayal of characters is also more detailed and full-bodied. In "The Red Flag," we saw the tragic history of the old generation of revolutionary peasants charging against reactionary forces in the long years of dark rule. In the character of Liu Zhen, the deep-seated class hatred of peasants against landlords for generations is concentrated, and the revolutionary demands of peasants inspired and encouraged by the Party are embodied. "Bitter Herbs" depicts a brave and kind revolutionary mother against the backdrop of complex and cruel struggles in the anti-Japanese base areas. The political commissar Li Youguo in "Ten Thousand Mountains and Rivers," who dedicated his life to the Party and revolution, still confidently shouted "Let the revolution advance on horseback" before his death, leaving an unforgettable impression in our minds. "Red Sun" depicts a high-ranking commander Shen Zhenxin, who bears the responsibility for the success or failure of a decisive battle, yet remains calm and decisive. In the character of Yang Zhenrong in "Forest of Fire and Snow," the brave and clever style of revolutionary scouts is summarized. "The Creation of History" deeply depicts the fierce class struggles and the different faces of various classes in the village during the process of agricultural cooperation, creating a true image of a young revolutionary peasant Liang Shengbao who resolutely takes the socialist path. Qin Degui in "Tempered in the Fire," Deng Xiumei in "Great Changes in a Mountain Village," and the protagonists in "Newly Acquainted Companions" and "The Short Biography of Li Shuangshuang" are all lively images of young workers and peasants.

The creation of these characters answers the question of who are the heroes of our times, indicating that the working class and laboring people have taken their rightful place in our literary works.

The laboring masses are the creators of human civilization and social wealth, but because they have long been in a politically and economically oppressed and exploited position, in the past literary works, they were often either ignored or distorted. With the working class taking the stage of history, the working class demands that literature correctly depict the laboring people and that literature become a weapon of struggle for the working class.

As early as the 1840s, Engels saw that Dickens, George Sand, and Eugene Sue depicted "the poor and the despised classes" in their works and highly praised this phenomenon, considering it a "thorough revolution" in the field of European novels. (_The Movement on the Continent, Collected Works of Marx and Engels, Volume 1_) Later, in the 1880s, he formally proposed to revolutionary writers the task of depicting the revolutionary struggles of the working class. He said that the description of such revolutionary struggles should "demand a position in the realm of realism" (_Letter to Hacknas, Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin on Literature_). By the time of Lenin, the center of the proletarian revolutionary storm had shifted to Russia. In his famous "Party Organization and Party Literature," Lenin further proposed the slogan of party literature, pointing out: "Literary work should become part of the overall cause of the proletariat," and socialist literature should "serve the millions of laboring people." It was Lenin who first formulated the fighting program for proletarian literature and art.

Our revolutionary new literature and art were born under the inspiration of the great October Revolution and are part of the world proletarian socialist literature and art. Shortly after its birth, the Communist Party of China, in response to the needs of revolutionary struggles, proposed the advocacy of creating revolutionary literature and art. Lu Xun, Qu Qiubai, and many revolutionary writers and artists had struggled to open the way for proletarian literature and art, even shedding blood and sacrificing their lives. Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the specific practices of the Chinese revolution, creatively developed Lenin's principles on party literature, clearly pointing out the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This has brought about a fundamental historical change in our literature and art.

Comrade Mao Zedong's great contribution to Marxist literary theory lies not only in most clearly and profoundly proposing the question of literature for whom, but also in fundamentally solving the question of how to serve. Comrade Mao Zedong explored from all aspects the paths for literature to serve the laboring people, regulated the dialectical relationship between the popularization and elevation of literature, and placed the center of all problems on the fundamental issue of literary workers uniting with the workers and peasants and thus transforming their worldviews. Only by uniting with the workers and peasants can literary workers find the richest source of creation, become familiar with new lives and new characters, and have the possibility of writing works that truly depict the workers and peasants and are loved and beneficial to the people. The new era has given our literature and art new tasks, and new-era writers and artists cannot but take a new path of life and creation different from that of old-era writers and artists, which is the path of uniting with the workers and peasants. Only in this way can non-proletarian intellectual writers and artists change their original worldviews, establish communist worldviews, and become true spokesmen of the working class. Even young writers and artists of worker and peasant origin or those nurtured in the new society need to undergo constant transformation and maintain long-term and close contact with the workers and peasants. Once they deviate from the masses, deviate from revolutionary struggles and productive labor, they will not be able to withstand the infiltration of bourgeois ideology and will go astray, and some may even fall into the anti-socialist quagmire. Liu Shaotang is an example. Therefore, the proletarianization of literary workers is the fundamental key to the proletarian direction of literature and art.

After the rectification campaign and the struggle against the rightists in 1957, literary workers went to the countryside and factories in large numbers to participate in labor and grassroots work, which played a decisive role in promoting the further unity of literary workers with the laboring people and the change of their worldviews, lifestyles, and artistic views. Literary workers truly understood the profound meaning of the phrase "labor is glorious" through their participation in labor practices. They did not go to "experience life" with the special identity of artists but lived, worked, and labored with the masses in the same way as ordinary laborers. They became familiar with the objects they were to serve and depict through their further contact with the laboring people, shared common feelings and languages with the laboring people, and greatly enhanced their revolutionary consciousness due to the influence of the laboring people's sublime qualities. They saw into the hearts of the laboring people, knew how to depict the laboring people; they understood what the people needed and what they should create for the people. How can a writer who does not love the workers and peasants, who is not familiar with the lives, emotions, and languages of the masses, write vivid works that truly depict the workers and peasants? In recent years, many outstanding works can be said to be the creations of writers and artists who have rich experience in struggles and are familiar with the lives of the masses. Due to the transformation of worldviews and the enhancement of political consciousness, many old writers and artists have joined the Communist Party of China. At the same time, a large number of new literary forces have emerged from the workers, peasants, and cadres. A powerful revolutionary literary and artistic team with workers and peasants as the backbone has grown up.

"Educators must be educated," literary workers should, through creative practices, educate the people with communist spirits, first of all, through life practices, learn from the people, learn their excellent qualities, learn their labor and struggle spirits, and turn the abstract communism in books into concrete and living communism. The process of literary workers going deep into the workers and peasants and participating in labor is a process of getting to know the workers and peasants, and more importantly, a process of transforming their worldviews. Because only by participating in revolutionary struggles and productive struggles can the communist worldview become the soul of writers and artists. At the same time, only by participating in productive labor can our literary workers, especially young literary workers, gradually get rid of the one-sidedness and narrowness caused by the separation of mental and physical labor, making themselves comprehensive communist new people. The view that participating in physical labor will ruin artistic talents is wrong; this only shows that those who hold this view despise labor. In fact, it is in the ranks of laborers that countless talents are hidden, and participating in labor is the best way to train and cultivate various talents of the working class.

The direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers is the most thorough and resolute proletarian literary direction, which requires literature and art to serve the broadest masses of workers and peasants, requires literature and art to depict the workers and peasants, and most fundamentally requires the proletarianization of literary workers, thoroughly transforming their worldviews.

With the change of the foundation, the superstructure must also change. However, the change of the ideological superstructure is much slower than the change of the foundation. Therefore, after the establishment of the socialist society, the political and ideological influences of the bourgeoisie will still exist for a long time, and even in the communist society, there will still be struggles between the advanced and the backward, the correct and the wrong, which determines that ideological struggles and ideological transformations are long-term tasks. In the past decade, bourgeois ideology in our country has been continuously criticized, and revisionism in our literary circles has not been able to occupy the main position, but this does not mean that they no longer exist; they act according to the situation. As long as there is a little wind or grass movement at home and abroad, they will stir up trouble again, like scum floating to the surface, taking the opportunity to spread poison. The international revisionist trend will inevitably have an impact on our country. Therefore, to adhere to the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the cause of socialism, we must insist on struggling against revisionism and other bourgeois ideologies that oppose this direction.

Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend

Literature and art serve the broad laboring people and the great cause of socialism and communism, which is the only political direction of our literature and art, and there should be no other direction. However, in terms of artistic styles, forms, genres, and themes, we advocate diversity, encourage free creation, and oppose uniformity, rigidity, and narrowness. Our principle is the unity of the consistency of the political direction and the diversity of artistic styles. Comrade Mao Zedong, based on a scientific analysis of the contradictions within the people in socialist society, proposed the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. Under the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the cause of socialism, implementing the policies of letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend, and innovating the old, this is the correct, broadest, and most creative path for the development of our socialist literature and art. Practice has proven that this is the most correct, broadest, and most creative path for the development of our socialist literature and art. This path guides all writers and artists of different schools and styles to a common great goal, and combines the personal wisdom of writers and artists with the collective wisdom of the masses.

The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and innovating the old was proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong in the early days of the founding of the nation to revitalize and develop our opera art. This policy promoted an unprecedented prosperity of our opera industry. In 1956, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the policies of letting a hundred flowers bloom and letting a hundred schools of thought contend side by side as the policy for the development of literature and art and science; this policy was quickly extended to various fronts of politics and ideology. Big debates, big-character posters, big discussions, and big arguments became good methods for the people to educate and criticize themselves, to implement the mass line and give full play to the initiative and creativity of the people in the political life of the people, and at the same time became powerful weapons for the people to fight against the enemy.

The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend, and innovating the old has promoted the full and diverse development of various genres of literature and art, and promoted the innovation of old traditions. We have done a large amount of work with remarkable results to inherit and develop our national literary and artistic heritage. We have restored the vitality of hundreds of local operas that were on the brink of extinction or had long disappeared from the stage before liberation; tens of thousands of opera scripts and folk narrative literature have seen the light of day again; countless folk songs, folk narrative poems, and folk stories of various nationalities have been recorded, organized, and published; rich and diverse folk music, dance, and folk art have been widely supported and developed. We have opened one treasure trove after another of national and folk arts that have long been buried, wiped off the dust accumulated on them, and under the illumination of Marxist thought, selected the essence and discarded the dross, making them new and shining brilliantly. Many excellent traditional operas and songs, dances, acrobatics, puppetry, and shadow plays that have been revised and adapted have won the praise of the broad audience. "The Fifteen Strings of Cash," "Life and Death Cards," "Mu Guiying Takes Command," "The Yang Family Generals," "The Book Search," "The Story of Fu Nu," "Father and Son's Hatred," "The Wall and the Horse," "Chasing the Fish," and other excellent opera scripts that are often performed are the fruits of the opera industry's practice of letting a hundred flowers bloom and innovating the old. Many operas have been significantly innovated from scripts to performances. We have enriched the achievements of our predecessors with new wisdom and skills. This is not a simple inheritance of heritage but a new creation. Using traditional opera forms to express modern themes has also gained successful experience, producing many popular plays such as "The Red Seed," "Chicken Feathers Fly to the Sky," and "Winter Goes, Spring Comes." On our stage, various opera genres across the country have produced many talented young performers. Storytelling, as the vanguard of literature and art, has made beneficial contributions to the rapid reflection of current revolutionary struggles. Painters have used traditional techniques to realistically and naturally depict the life of the new era and the natural scenery of the motherland, giving Chinese painting new life. Crafts and architecture have maintained national characteristics while showing the style of the new era, thus winning the admiration of people.

The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and innovating the old has not only promoted the innovation of old traditions but also promoted the further nationalization of new literature and art. Novelists have shown more national styles in the use of language, the portrayal of characters, and the structure of plots. Poets, under the impact of the new folk song movement, have striven to develop new poetry on the basis of classical poetry and folk songs, changing the style of poetry. Various paintings and sculptures have become more and more distinctive in national characteristics. New operas not only express new revolutionary content but also have more nationalized forms, producing good plays like "The Marriage of the Little Black Brothers" and "The Red Guards of Honghu Lake." In music, many instrumental and vocal works with national characteristics have been created, expressing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people in the Great Leap Forward era. "The Jade Lamp," "The Small Sword Society," and "Five Red Clouds" are new attempts at creating national dance dramas. Spoken drama and film have also made many efforts in nationalization.

The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and innovating the old has promoted the rapid development of literature and art among various ethnic minorities in our country. Now, many talented writers, poets, and artists have emerged among various ethnic minorities. The literary heritage of ethnic minorities is also rich; folk narrative poems that have been organized, such as "Gedameilin," "Axiangma," and "Zhaoshutun," are treasures of people's poetry. Some excellent folk songs and folk legends, such as "Liu Sanjie" and "Qin Niangmei," have successfully been staged. Many ethnic minorities have begun to create their own national operas and spoken dramas.

Due to the implementation of the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and innovating the old, the forms and genres of our literature and art have become more diverse, and the scope of themes has been expanded. Novels, short stories, essays, sketches, multi-act plays, one-act plays, symphonies, large-scale choral works, mass songs, folk songs, oil paintings, sculptures, national paintings, prints, propaganda posters, cartoons, feature films, newsreels, scientific and educational films, animated films, and photographic works have all played their respective functions and creations, each with its own merits. We value carefully structured masterpieces, but we also value short, sharp works like daggers and spears. Our literary works not only focus on depicting real struggles but also, with new perspectives, re-present historical figures. "Guan Hanqing," "Cai Wenji," and "Princess Wencheng" are successful plays based on ancient history. Children's literature and children's theater, with the responsibility of educating the next generation with communist spirits, have received special attention.

Under the guidance of the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and innovating the old, on the one hand, we inherit and innovate our excellent literary and artistic heritage, making them part of advanced socialist culture; on the other hand, we make various forms and genres of new literature and art have more dazzling national characteristics, and the two sides approach and combine with each other, developing into diverse socialist national new literature and art.

Comrade Mao Zedong advocated as early as twenty years ago to establish a fresh, lively, and Chinese-style and Chinese spirit that the Chinese people like to hear and see. Our literature and art have a history of several thousand years, accumulating rich creative experience, forming their own long-standing national forms and styles. Revolutionary literature and art, if they do not have national characteristics, if they do not create new national forms suitable for new content on the basis of their own national traditions, it will be difficult for them to take root and blossom among the broad masses. The nationalization and popularization of literature and art are inseparable and complementary. Since the May Fourth Movement, our literature and art have absorbed a large amount of foreign literary and artistic experience, adopted many foreign artistic forms and expressions, which is completely necessary. Since the founding of the nation, with the development of cultural exchanges with the outside world, through the efforts of translators, we have come into contact with a larger number of excellent literary, film, and artistic works from various countries in the world, especially the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, absorbing what is useful to us, which has brought great benefits to the broad readers, audience, and literary circles in our country. However, all foreign artistic forms and techniques, when transplanted to China, must be transformed and assimilated, making them have national characteristics and become their own national things. Now, our literature and art are increasingly showing nationalization and popularization characteristics. The national originality of literature and art is the concentrated expression of the creativity of the masses, the mark of the maturity of literature and art of an era and a class.

The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom has liberated the spiritual creativity of the masses to an unprecedented degree. With the emergence of the Great Leap Forward and the cultural revolution, a high tide of mass literary and artistic creation has been set off. On construction sites, in rural areas, poems and paintings cover the walls, and songs fill the air. New folk songs and new wall paintings are the products of the Great Leap Forward, and in turn, they promote the Great Leap Forward. Their revolutionary romantic colors and bold, fresh styles are a reflection of the colors of our times and the styles of the masses. The writing of revolutionary memoirs, factory histories, and commune histories has been widely carried out in cooperation with cadres, intellectuals, and the masses of workers and peasants. Collective creation has become an important form of our literary and artistic creation activities and an important method to implement the mass line in literary work. The masses of workers and peasants and revolutionary cadres have created history, and today they have picked up their pens to write their own history. "Sparks of a Prairie Fire," "The Red Star in the North," "The Red Anshan," and "Green Trees Cast Shade" are the first batch of precious fruits. Our literature and art are composed of two parts: the creation of professional writers and the amateur creation of the masses, and these two parts together constitute the magnificent and magnificent panorama of Chinese literature and art.

The policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend has promoted the active development of free debates and mass criticism in the literary and ideological circles. Through debates, we have opened up the struggle between the two lines in literature and art, and at the same time, we have had beneficial discussions on many problems in literary creation and theory. Through these debates, the Marxist viewpoint has taken a solid position in literary theory and literary criticism. In the past two years, in various colleges and universities and art academies across the country, there have been criticisms of bourgeois academic thoughts in literary education, and on the basis of this criticism, students and teachers have cooperated to write a batch of literary theory and literary history, art history books, marking the rapid growth of new Marxist forces.

From the above aspects, it can be seen that the implementation of the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and letting a hundred schools of thought contend in literary work has achieved remarkable results, and practice has proven the correctness of this policy. However, when this policy was first proposed, it was not all people who had confidence, not only that, but there were also many people who misunderstood and opposed this policy.

Imperialists and their lackeys—the bourgeois rightists and revisionists—once tried to make letting a hundred flowers bloom and letting a hundred schools of thought contend a bourgeois "liberalization" policy, a policy of "tolerance" and "indulgence" towards all bourgeois ideologies and anti-socialist weeds. When they were blinded by their subjective estimates and suffered a crushing defeat in the second half of 1957, they changed their tune, claiming that we had abandoned letting a hundred flowers bloom and letting a hundred schools of thought contend, claiming that this policy was only a temporary strategy and means. The class nature of these gentlemen has completely blinded their eyes, what methods can make them correctly understand the Marxist policies of the proletariat?

We have always advocated that letting a hundred flowers bloom is letting a hundred flowers bloom within the socialist realm, is blooming socialist flowers, is developing socialist literature and art through the method of free competition, opposing anti-socialist literature and art; letting a hundred schools of thought contend is letting a hundred schools of thought contend under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, is propagating and developing Marxist dialectical materialism through the method of free debate, opposing bourgeois idealism and metaphysics. Therefore, the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and letting a hundred schools of thought contend is the most correct policy for the rapid development of our literature and art and science, which is not only conducive to correctly handling the contradictions within the people in the ideological realm but also conducive to competing and struggling with bourgeois literature and pseudoscience. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said, letting a hundred flowers bloom and letting a hundred schools of thought contend is the extremely firm class policy of the proletariat.

The bourgeois rightists and revisionists tried to use the slogan of letting a hundred flowers bloom to spread their anti-socialist weeds. In their eyes, all our flowers are not flowers. Like those who have a penchant for filth and decay, they specialize in appreciating the decadent and declining capitalist art, treating it as a fragrant flower. Different worldviews, different aesthetic views. What we consider fragrant flowers, they consider weeds, what we consider weeds, they consider fragrant flowers. They want us to treat weeds as fragrant flowers to worship, which is of course impossible. The main point of disagreement and contention between us and the revisionists and bourgeois literati on this issue is here.

On the issue of letting a hundred flowers bloom and letting a hundred schools of thought contend, we also have disagreements with dogmatists. Dogmatists are detached from the masses, detached from reality, do not understand dialectics, and do not recognize the diversity of the world. They only want the consistency of the political direction and do not want the diversity of artistic styles, only allowing one flower to bloom and not allowing a hundred flowers to bloom. This is very harmful.

In the socialist garden, can there be only one kind of flower? The peony is called the king of flowers, but if only the peony is allowed to bloom and other flowers are not allowed to bloom, then even if the peony is good, it will make people feel monotonous. Monotonous life and monotonous art are what people do not like. The life of the people is originally rich and colorful, and the literature and art that reflect the life of the people should also be rich and colorful. In our society, as the material life of the laboring people improves, their spiritual life becomes richer, their requirements for material and spiritual products will also increase, not only requiring more quantity of these products but also requiring more varieties and better quality. Due to the different needs, interests, and hobbies of people, the more varieties, the better. Only diverse art can satisfy the ever-increasing and multifaceted spiritual needs of the masses, can give full play to the different personalities and talents of each writer and artist. Literature and art must serve politics; politics is a very broad field; the ways and methods for literature and art to serve politics should be diverse. We advocate works with high revolutionary ideological content and perfect artistic forms. We advocate that literary works express the themes of real struggles and encourage and help literary workers to strive to approach and familiarize themselves with the new life of the people, to participate in the fiery struggles of the people. At the same time, each writer and artist can decide what themes to choose and what forms of expression to adopt based on their political responsibility, personal life experience, interests, and strengths. The readers, audience, and listeners of the new era love to read works that reflect the lives and struggles of their contemporaries, and they also like to watch the fascinating historical and legendary stories performed on the stage; they like to listen to moving battle songs, and they also enjoy beautiful and healthy lyrical music and lyrical dances. The new era needs more magnificent revolutionary historical paintings, revolutionary customs paintings, and portraits, but in our art garden, should not the new style of landscape paintings and bird and flower paintings also have their place? People need to be inspired in their spiritual life, and they also need to be pleased. As long as they do not violate the six political standards stipulated by Comrade Mao Zedong in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," the most important thing is that they do not violate the socialist path and the leadership of the Communist Party, various forms, themes, and styles of art works can be developed. We advocate that through the methods of criticism and competition, works with erroneous thoughts or inferior art are gradually eliminated, and the ideological and artistic levels of works are gradually improved, and socialist literary and artistic competition is the best method to encourage artistic style diversity, develop artistic schools, and improve the quality of works.

To let a hundred flowers bloom, weeds may pretend to be fragrant flowers and appear, so the content of letting a hundred flowers bloom and letting a hundred schools of thought contend must include two aspects that are opposite and yet interconnected: letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding out weeds.

Letting a hundred flowers bloom is an internal matter of the people. The contradictions between the advanced and the backward, the correct and the wrong, among the people will always exist. To solve this kind of contradiction, only the methods of discussion, persuasion, comparison, and competition can be adopted, and administrative commands and coercive methods cannot be adopted. In academic and artistic issues, we oppose arbitrariness, oppose coercion, oppose rude criticism, and advocate reaching correct conclusions through full discussion to distinguish right from wrong. The right and wrong of academic issues and the skillfulness of art often take a long time to make a definite conclusion and evaluation. Some newly emerging things are often not easy to distinguish whether they are fragrant flowers or weeds, and some fragrant flowers may also contain local defects, so not only does identifying weeds require insight, identifying fragrant flowers also requires insight; not only does weeding out weeds require courage, protecting fragrant flowers also requires courage. To nurture the growth of new things, to prevent ideological stagnation, we should advocate a lively and free debate atmosphere, advocate a style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, encourage the creativity of the masses, and encourage writers and critics to innovate and create in their creations and theories.

Weeding out weeds is a matter of the enemy. Weeds are an objective existence, and their birth is determined by certain historical conditions. To prevent them from occurring and appearing is impossible. The question is, what method is the most effective to eliminate the harm of weeds? Revisionists are opposed to fighting against weeds; they are protectors of all kinds of weeds; revisionist trends themselves are the most harmful weeds. They advocate adopting a policy of laissez-faire, "tolerance," and "indulgence" on the cultural and ideological fronts, whose purpose is to allow socialist countries to allow capitalist reactionary culture to exist legally and spread freely, to poison the people and poison the youth. This is what we firmly oppose. On the other hand, we do not approve of the methods of dogmatists. Dogmatists, as soon as they see weeds appear, ban them, and this simple administrative command method, although it can achieve temporary effects, leaves endless troubles. This is actually allowing weeds to temporarily hide underground or let them come out to harm people in disguise, which is a disguised laissez-faire, and cannot kill the enemy. Our policy is, when weeds sprout, to treat them as the opposite side, let them face the masses, and mobilize the masses to discuss them, so that more masses can recognize their true face, enhance the masses' ability to distinguish and fight. We always trust and rely on the strength of the masses; we firmly believe that truth will ultimately defeat falsehood. Therefore, we are not afraid of weeds, not afraid of opposing views, not afraid of open debates, not afraid of correct views being attacked or misunderstood at a certain time. The experience of the struggle against the rightists has proven that our approach is completely correct. The result of this struggle is that the people, including the vast majority of young students, not only have not been pulled over by the rightists but, through the debates of the masses, relying on the strength of the masses, have thoroughly crushed the rightists. At the same time, practice has proven that the debates and criticisms of the masses are a bitter but effective medicine for helping bourgeois intellectuals to transform their thoughts.

Under the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the cause of socialism, the implementation of letting a hundred flowers bloom and letting a hundred schools of thought contend has opposed both revisionism and dogmatism; has ensured the consistency of the political direction of literature and art and the diversity of artistic styles; has guided writers and artists to unite with the workers and peasants, establish a revolutionary worldview, and given writers and artists full opportunities to display their artistic originality. Therefore, we believe this is the most correct path for the development of our socialist literature and art.

Revolutionary Realism and Revolutionary Romanticism

To make literature and art better reflect our times and more powerfully serve the broad laboring people and the great cause of socialism and communism, we advocate the method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism.

The proposal of this artistic method is another great contribution of Comrade Mao Zedong to Marxist literary theory. Comrade Mao Zedong proposed this method based on the Marxist thought of combining the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of stages of revolutionary development, based on the development laws of literature and art itself, and based on the needs of the current revolutionary struggle. He applied the principle of combining revolutionary spirit and practical spirit to literature and art, dialectically unifying the two artistic methods of realism and romanticism in literature and art, so as to better express our times, to better absorb all the excellent traditions in the literary and artistic heritage, and to better give play to the different personalities and styles of writers and artists. In this way, a broad and free world is opened up for socialist literature and art. This combination of the two spirits is not only applicable to literary creation but also to literary criticism.

First of all, let's talk about the issue of revolutionary ideals in socialist literature and art. The basic spirit of the revolutionary romanticism we advocate is revolutionary idealism, which is the expression of revolutionary idealism in artistic methods.

The ideological foundation of our literature and art is Marxism-Leninism. The philosophy of Marxism-Leninism is the most thorough revolutionary philosophy, which combines cold scientific analysis with fervent revolutionary spirit and the practical struggles of the masses. Marxists are the most sober revolutionary realists and at the same time the most idealistic revolutionary idealists. The fundamental difference between us Marxists and mechanical materialists lies in the fact that we, on the basis of a correct understanding of objective reality, fully value subjective initiative, value advanced ideas and scientific foresight, value the great significance of revolutionary fantasies. A proletarian revolutionary fighter, fearlessly facing dangers and hardships, is not this due to the sublime ideals inspiring him? For us, the revolutionary cause of transforming the world is endless, today's ideals are tomorrow's realities, and tomorrow will have new and higher ideals inspiring us to continue to advance. Our struggles and labor are precisely to continuously turn advanced ideals into realities.

The revolutionary leaders of the proletariat have always, based on scientific foresight and revolutionary ideals, seen clearly the course of historical progress. Everyone knows that Lenin proposed in "What Is To Be Done?" that "we need to dream!" In the preface he wrote in 1907 for the Russian translation of Marx's letters to Kugelmann, he gave a merciless criticism of those opportunist gentlemen who, at the slightest sign of a revolutionary ebb, quickly abandoned "revolutionary dreams" and turned to "realism" in small matters, those "clever fellows" who "curse revolutionary romanticism" and "realism." Comrade Mao Zedong, in the years when the Chinese revolution suffered serious setbacks and was temporarily in a low ebb, foresaw that "a single spark can start a prairie fire," and with poetic language, announced that a more magnificent and magnificent revolutionary high tide, like a sun rising with radiant rays, was about to come. It is this far-sighted revolutionary fantasy that has played an immeasurable role in the development of human history.

In every era, every class has its own ideals, and in its literature and art, it has created a series of heroic figures based on its sublime ideals and moral standards. From the entire history of literature, we can see that all nations have their own poems that have been passed down for thousands of years singing the praises of heroes. In the past, our literary works have created many typical figures of heroes from various eras, and their extraordinary characters and extraordinary deeds have been sung by the people for generations. Western bourgeois literature, in the rising period of capitalism, also depicted some characters embodying bourgeois revolutionary thoughts. However, after the mid-19th century, the ideals propagated by the bourgeoisie were completely shattered, and bourgeois writers could no longer write outstanding characters of their own class. In the works of modern reactionary bourgeois writers, there are countless sex maniacs, decadents, split personalities, misanthropes, and even rogues, swindlers, robbers, and murderers, these are the "heroes" in the minds of the bourgeoisie who are heading towards extinction. In the era of proletarian revolution, new heroes can only be the advanced elements of the proletariat and revolutionary people. Creating new heroes has become the glorious task of socialist literature and art.

Title: Our Literature and Art Should Create Characters That Best Reflect the Revolutionary Ideals of the Proletariat

Page: 1

Our literature and art should create characters that best reflect the revolutionary ideals of the proletariat. These characters are not the products of a writer's imagination but are new people who have emerged from actual struggles. Their most precious qualities are manifested in their fearlessness in the face of difficulties and their refusal to rest on their laurels after achieving victories. They are driven by the socialist ideal to complete the arduous democratic revolution and are now, under the inspiration of the even higher communist ideal, engaged in the great socialist construction. Their noble ideals and arduous struggles have cultivated and tempered their noble qualities and strong characters. They are always advancing, always at the forefront of life. These are the new people of socialism and communism, the advanced forces driving the progress of the era.

Reactionary writers of the bourgeoisie and revisionists attack our literature and art precisely because they hate the revolutionary ideals expressed in our literature and art and the new characters who embody these ideals. They do not like the reality of socialism, and they dislike the new people of socialism and communism even more. They do not believe that the great ideals of scientific communism and revolutionary struggle can nurture countless of the most noble and outstanding individuals of our era. Some writers with bourgeois prejudices always think that the advanced individuals we describe in the people's masses are unrealistic, and only the "gray" "little people" or the despicable antagonists are "true." Their argument is that everyone has flaws and weaknesses, and everyone's heart harbors a struggle between light and darkness, which is their so-called "inner complexity." We oppose simplifying characters. The inner life of new-era characters is the richest and healthiest. They know how to treat labor, friendship, love, and family life; they will naturally have troubles and inner conflicts, and they will make mistakes and errors, but they always strive to make communist thought and morality the highest principle of all their actions. What do the "inner complexity" advocated by bourgeois writers have in common with the rich inner life of the new-era laboring people? The so-called "secrets of the human soul" they want to expose are nothing but the self-revelation of their own dark hearts. They are eager to write about people lacking willpower and their trivial affairs, failing to see or unwilling to portray today's heroes and great struggles, or forcing the base and empty hearts of the bourgeoisie onto the new people of socialism and communism. Their works are filled with gloomy and depressing tones, painting the new life of socialist society and the fighting life of the masses in black. The result of their actions will inevitably lead people to despair of socialist reality, causing spiritual disintegration and collapse in socialist countries. This is precisely in line with the wishes of imperialism. Just look at the comments of imperialist literary critics. They either rejoice in the fact that there are people in our socialist countries who bring the "superfluous people" into socialist literature, or they incite socialist country writers to pursue the "tragic dreams of the world." How imperialists and revisionists attempt to inject bourgeois decaying thoughts and despairing sentiments into socialist literature and art. If their attempts succeed, socialist literature and art will degenerate into a variant of bourgeois reactionary decadent literature and will no longer be revolutionary literature.

Every writer should have their own ideals. Of course, ideals come in various forms: there are lofty and petty, correct and incorrect, revolutionary and reactionary. Only ideals that conform to the objective development of reality and the interests of the majority of the people are correct ideals. Today, the highest revolutionary ideal of humanity is the realization of communism. Imperialists and various reactionaries also have their "ideals," which are to preserve and expand capitalism and resist and eliminate socialism. Our writers and artists should stand at the peak of the highest ideals of this era to observe and describe life, cultivate the communist moral qualities of the people, and eliminate the influence of various old thoughts and habits left over from the old era. Compared to the great goal of liberating all of humanity, all other personal wishes are petty and insignificant. The communist ideal should be the soul of our literary creation.

By emphasizing revolutionary ideals in literature and art, will we harm the authenticity of literature and art?

Regarding "authenticity" and "realism," there is a stark difference between our understanding and that of the revisionists. Revisionists often use the pretext of "writing the truth" and "realism" to oppose the tendency of socialist literature and art. They deliberately oppose the authenticity of literature and art with its tendency, claiming that tendency will hinder authenticity. In reality, they oppose only the revolutionary tendency of literature and art, aiming to replace it with the reactionary tendency of the bourgeoisie. They exclude the advanced ideals of life, and their so-called realism is realism without advanced ideals, which is not realism but vulgar naturalism or decadence. Their so-called "authenticity" is actually a distortion of reality. We have always advocated that literature and art must be authentic and opposed to false literature and art. However, we are not advocates of "authenticity for the sake of authenticity." In a class society, writers always observe and describe reality with a certain class tendency, and only by standing on the side of the advanced class and the masses can one most deeply understand and reflect the authenticity of the era. The choice and description of what topics a people's writer should address first depends on whether it is beneficial to the people. Authenticity and revolutionary tendency are unified in us.

When it comes to realism, we cannot fail to cite Engels' famous definition: "Realism is not only the truth of details but also the truth of the typical characters in typical environments." (_Letter to Harkness_) This is what Engels said in a letter to a female writer. In this letter, Engels criticized the writer for depicting the workers of London as too passive, believing that such a depiction of the working class of London, which had undergone decades of struggle, was not typical. From this definition, we can draw what conclusions? First, realism cannot focus only on the trivial truth of details; the truth of details must serve the principle of typification. Second, Engels requires writers to portray "typical characters in typical environments." For revolutionary writers, this means requiring them to portray new characters and new thoughts that represent the advanced forces of the era, requiring them to portray the heroic struggles of the proletariat and the masses. Engels criticized the so-called "true socialists" of Germany very early on, accusing them of singing the praises of various "little people" but not singing the praises of the stubborn and stormy revolutionary proletariat. (_Poetry and Prose of German Socialism, Marx and Engels Collected Works, Volume 4_) However, the superb theories of Marxist classics on realism have long been subjected to the most vicious distortions by revisionists like Hu Feng and Lukács. Engels originally proposed the problem of realism from the standpoint of the communist worldview and the interests of the proletariat, calling on writers to look forward and create images of the advanced characters of the era. While the revisionists derived from Engels' letter the absurd conclusion that worldview is unimportant in literary creation, even believing that the more reactionary the worldview, the better. They called on revolutionary writers to look backward, to align with Balzac's worldview. Now is the time to thoroughly sweep away such fallacies.

More than twenty years ago, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet literary and art circles led by Gorky, based on the experience of the development of Soviet literature, proposed the banner of socialist realism. This banner was endorsed by revolutionary writers around the world. In recent years, revisionists have fiercely attacked socialist realism, aiming to slander the great achievements of socialist literature, attack the socialist system, and try to pull socialist writers onto the path of the bourgeoisie. They use "writing the truth" as a pretext to oppose the noble task of using socialist spirit to educate the people in literature and art. In our country, Qin Zhaoyang is like this. Some writers whose revolutionary spirit has declined or whose revolutionary will is not firm have also been influenced by this revisionist trend. They seek out the dark corners and historical garbage in socialist reality, failing to see the brilliant whole of socialist reality and the even brighter future of communism. We advocate that literature and art should portray the reality of revolutionary development and the ideals of a better future, combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. This is a powerful response to the attacks of revisionists.

Our era is filled with heroic deeds. The people of our country have never been as fully expressive of their lofty revolutionary will and high creative spirit as they are today, displaying such high revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism on every front of building and defending the country. How should our literature and art truly reflect the spiritual appearance of the people, that is, how to reflect the appearance of our era? Can we use gloomy tones, gray language, and trivial naturalistic methods to reflect the appearance of our era? That is absolutely impossible. We need to use majestic language, grand tones, and vivid colors to sing and depict our era. Revolutionary romanticism in literature and art is the crystallization of revolutionary romanticism in people's lives. Using the artistic method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism can help our writers and artists most truly and deeply portray this heroic era and its heroes.

Of course, life is full of contradictions. New things in life always emerge and grow in the struggle against old things. The characteristic of our advanced characters is precisely that they dare to struggle against all phenomena that go against the interests of the people, can overcome various difficulties and obstacles, and open up new paths for life. We face the contradictions within the people of socialist society, which fundamentally prevents us from falling into the trap of the theory of no conflict. Our literature and art should not avoid shortcomings and difficulties, ignore negative things and antagonists, dilute the contradictions and struggles in life; this cheap optimism will only simplify life, portray true advanced characters as lifeless scarecrows. Such works will neither arouse people's respect for beautiful things nor arouse people's hatred for ugly things, nor will they cause people to think about the problems of life, and they will be forgotten as soon as they are read. We should enthusiastically sing the praises of new characters and new thoughts, and mercilessly lash out at old things and old thoughts, deeply reflecting the sharp struggle between new things and old things, because it is in such struggles that strong and noble heroic characters are formed and manifested.

Comrade Mao Zedong said in his _Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art_: "As an ideological form, literary works are the products of certain social life reflected in the human brain. Revolutionary literature is the product of the life of the people reflected in the brains of revolutionary writers." This shows that the authenticity of art comes from the authenticity of life, and the beauty of art comes from the beauty of life. Whoever does not admit this is not a Marxist, not a materialist, but a bourgeois idealist. However, just admitting this is not yet a complete Marxist, a complete materialist. Comrade Mao Zedong further pointed out: "Life and art, although both are beautiful, the life reflected in literary works can and should be higher, stronger, more concentrated, more typical, more ideal, and therefore more universal." He also pointed out: "Revolutionary literature should create various characters based on actual life to help the masses push history forward." Here, Comrade Mao Zedong very acutely expounded the characteristics of literature and art. Real life is the source of literature and art, but literature and art should be higher than reality; literature and art reflect life through images, create characters, and their purpose is not to passively reflect reality for the sake of reflecting reality, but to actively reflect and promote reality, transform reality. This is the complete Marxist viewpoint.

Human art has had both realistic and ideal elements from the beginning. Later, realism and romanticism developed into two different schools. Realists tend to observe and are good at depicting precise images of the objective world; romantics tend to imagine and are good at expressing passionate fantasies about the ideal world. Both reflect reality from different angles, enriching the history of literature and art.

However, there has been a one-sided view of realism and romanticism in the past. When talking about literary and artistic traditions, many people often emphasize realism, as if realism is all good and romanticism is all bad, and forget the excellent romantic traditions that have been accumulated and enriched in the entire history of literature and art. They regard romanticism as incompatible with realism. In fact, in the vast history of literature and art, there has been advanced and idealistic realism, as well as vulgar and shortsighted realism; there has been passive and reactionary romanticism, as well as active and progressive romanticism. This mainly depends on the writer's and artist's attitude towards the people and reality. Many great and outstanding writers and artists in history, although their individualities and styles varied due to the different eras they lived in, had some who were richer in the spirit of realism, some who were richer in the spirit of romanticism, some who excelled in meticulous realistic techniques, and some who excelled in passionate and bold imagination. But they often expressed both the spirit of realism and romanticism to different degrees in their works. They exposed the various irrational phenomena of reality in their works, always expressing their social ideals, strong love and hate, and clear praise and blame in the characters and relationships they described in their works; at the same time, their soaring passion and noble ideals were always inspired by the irrational phenomena of reality, rooted in the soil of life. Qu Yuan's _Lament for the Departed_ revealed the poet's affection for his country and people, his hatred of evil, and his magnificent imagination, becoming a brilliant masterpiece that shines through the ages. Guan Hanqing's _The Injustice to Dou E_ and other excellent Yuan operas truly depicted the cruel reality of life, passionately expressing the deep resentment and ultimate justice of the oppressed and wronged. _Water Margin_ created 108 revolutionary heroes with different personalities, and the author placed his ideal of "eight directions as one domain, different surnames as one family" in the shared victories and deaths of these characters. Dante's _Divine Comedy_, Shakespeare's many plays, and Goethe's _Faust_ all showed the wonderful combination of fantasy and reality. Gorky's _The Seagull_ and _The Song of the Eagle_ are inspiring calls to the people's revolutionary struggle. Lu Xun's works, from _Outcry_ to _New Stories_, expressed his sober attitude and critical spirit towards reality, as well as the passionate wishes of a revolutionary idealist.

The revolutionary realism and romanticism we advocate today critically inherit and synthesize the excellent traditions of realism and romanticism in the past, and in the new historical conditions, on the basis of the Marxist worldview, most perfectly combine the two into a completely new artistic method. We are in the era of the victory of socialism and communism, and are leaping from the "realm of necessity" to the "realm of freedom." The liberated people of our country have begun to become the masters of their own destiny; they have both lofty ideals and rich experiences of revolutionary struggle and productive struggle; their ability to recognize and transform reality is endless. This provides the most fertile soil for the combination of revolutionary realism and romanticism.

Refuting Bourgeois Humanism

In the above, I have described our literary direction, literary path, and literary methods. On all these issues, there are sharp differences between us and the revisionists, which ultimately boil down to the differences between two fundamentally different political lines and two different worldviews.

The literary and artistic front is one aspect of the entire political and ideological front; the revisionist ideas in the literary and artistic field are not isolated phenomena but are the manifestations of revisionist political and philosophical views in literature and art. Currently, revisionists are vigorously promoting bourgeois humanism, bourgeois hypocritical humanitarianism, "love for humanity," and bourgeois pacifism, and other fallacies to reconcile class contradictions, negate class struggle and revolution, spread illusions about imperialism, and achieve their unspoken goal of protecting the old capitalist world and destroying the new socialist world.

"Humanism" is a major ideological weapon of the revisionists. They use abstract common human nature to explain various historical and social phenomena, and use human nature or "humanitarianism" as the standard for morality and art, opposing literature and art serving the liberation cause of the proletariat and the laboring people. People can see that these reactionary trends have already had a very harmful impact on the people and their literature and art.

Revisionists particularly use literature and art to promote humanism and their so-called "humanitarianism." Yugoslav revisionist writers claim that "art is humanitarianism," art should express "eternal human emotions," and describe "general human nature." Of course, this theory is not a new discovery. The old revisionist theorist Lukács has long believed that humanistic ideals and principles are the "absolute criteria" for evaluating art, and the so-called humanistic ideals or principles are precisely "universal human nature." Hu Feng was the first to peddle this set of theories in our country, saying that "socialist spirit is humanitarian spirit," which is "a heart full of love." Feng Xuefeng also said that the fundamental requirement of people is "broad love for humanity." Just as the rightists were rampantly attacking, Ba Ren brought out this set of old weapons to attack socialist literature, saying that revolutionary literature lacks "human touch," because it does not express "the common things between people," that is, it lacks "humanistic human nature." Foreign and domestic revisionists are indeed of one mind.

How should we understand humanism? We believe that in a class society, there is no such thing as abstract, timeless, and classless humanitarian principles. In a class society, humanism as an ideology always has a certain era and class content. We must distinguish between proletarian humanism and bourgeois humanism. Bourgeois humanism, no matter how it appears, ultimately benefits the prolongation of the exploitation system; proletarian humanism aims to liberate humanity from all exploitation systems. We advocate proletarian humanism. At the same time, we give a full and correct evaluation of the progressive role that bourgeois humanism has played in history.

Humanism, as a social trend, emerged during the European Renaissance. At that time, humanists and later Enlightenment thinkers of the 18th century advocated "humanity" to oppose "divinity," advocated "human rights" to oppose "royal power," and advocated "individual liberation" to oppose the religious shackles of the Middle Ages and all their remnants. This trend indeed played an active and progressive role in history. Under the inspiration of this thought, many brilliant works were produced. However, the Enlightenment movement of the European bourgeoisie ultimately sought only to establish an "idealized kingdom of the bourgeoisie." In this "kingdom," the so-called human rights were only the property rights of the bourgeoisie, and the so-called individuality was the individuality of bourgeois individualism. At that time, revolutionary bourgeois thinkers regarded the struggle against feudalism as a struggle to establish a social system that conformed to human "nature," which was only their fantasy. After the bourgeoisie seized power, the slogans of bourgeois humanism, like their advocacy of "liberty, equality, fraternity," completely lost their initial anti-feudal luster and became lies used to cover up capitalist exploitation to deceive the working class and numb the laboring people.

In the 19th century, some active romanticist writers and critical realists condemned the dark side of capitalism and made moving accusations. Many of them also advocated humanism. However, due to their inability to break free from the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois perspective, their required humanism could not leave the circle of private property and individualism, and their works often ended in compromise with the bourgeois order or in pessimistic fatalism.

The Tito clique in Yugoslavia vigorously advocates "humanistic relations between people," advocates "human sympathy and love between people," and promotes the so-called "humanistic spirit" to educate the people and the so-called "humanistic attitude" to measure everything. They equate socialism with humanism. Let us see what their so-called "humanism" is. Their program states: "Socialism cannot make personal happiness serve any higher purpose, because the fundamental purpose of socialism is personal happiness." They oppose personal happiness and the interests of the people with the lofty ideal of common human happiness, and place personal interests above all else. Obviously, their so-called "humanism" is essentially bourgeois individualism. A Yugoslav writer, in an article praising this program, greatly admired Wilde's saying that "socialism is a path to true individualism," thus unwittingly admitting what their so-called "humanism" is all about.

This Yugoslav writer boasts that they are "members of the human family," which "exists both in the East and the West." A small group of Communist traitors in Britain raised the banner of "socialist humanism," advocating the "indivisibility" of humanity. Modern revisionists say that the division of the world into socialist and imperialist camps is the "source of all misfortunes." This shows their purpose in advocating "humanism." It is clear that the purpose is to negate the opposition of the two camps, negate the struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, and negate all revolutions.

The ideological foundation of bourgeois humanism is humanism, and the core of humanism is the so-called "love for humanity." Bourgeois writers and revisionists regard this "love" as "universal human nature" and the eternal theme of literature and art.

We know that as early as more than a hundred years ago, Marx and Engels mercilessly mocked the bourgeois thinkers like Kriege who turned communism into a delusion of love. Later, Engels sharply criticized Feuerbach's preaching about the love of humanity, believing that the abstract "love" he advocated was a reconciliation of class contradictions, which made "the last bit of revolutionary nature in his philosophy also disappear, leaving only an old tune: love each other! Kiss each other regardless of gender and class! Drink together in harmony!" (_Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy_) Now, some people in the Marxist camp equate communism with bourgeois humanism, saying that communism is the "highest embodiment of humanism," saying that socialist doctrine is the "most benevolent" doctrine, as if there is some intangible "humanism" that is an eternal and absolute truth, and communism is only its final manifestation. In this way, they abandon the great doctrine of historical materialism and class struggle of Marxism and return to the reactionary historical idealism and humanism of the bourgeoisie. They do not talk about or rarely talk about class nature and class struggle, but emphasize "human nature," "love for humanity," and "humanism." They abandon the language of Marxism and desperately adopt the old concepts and rhetoric of the bourgeoisie to cater to and please the bourgeoisie, trying to make communism something acceptable to the bourgeoisie. The result is not only that they become captives of bourgeois thought but also play the role of intentionally or unintentionally helping the bourgeoisie deceive and numb the people.

Of course, there are also some well-meaning people who are deceived by these attractive words, cannot distinguish the truth, and unknowingly throw Marxism to the winds.

Marxists and true revolutionaries never advocate abstract "humanism" and what "love for humanity." In a world where there are class oppositions, in a world where there are exploitation and oppression, it is impossible to have any class-transcending "love for humanity." Marxists only know about the friendship of the proletariat, the friendship of the laboring people, and the friendship of the oppressed people. Precisely because they truly love the people, they must hate those who oppress and exploit the people. They do not advocate love in a one-sided manner but advocate both love for the people and hatred for the oppressors and exploiters; they awaken the people's consciousness and urge the people to unite to overthrow the irrational social system and build a new and happy life through struggle. This is the content of proletarian humanism, and this is the content that revolutionary literature and art should express.

Everyone with a bit of Marxist knowledge knows that in a class society, there is no such thing as class-transcending "human nature," but only the human nature of this class or that class, that is, human nature with class characteristics. The founders of Marxism replaced the "worship of abstract man" with the "science of studying real man and his historical development." (_Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy_) According to the understanding of Marxism, "in terms of its reality, human nature is the sum of social relations." (_Theses on Feuerbach_) In fact, in the minds of revisionists, the so-called "human nature" is precisely the human nature of the bourgeoisie, that is, the class nature of the bourgeoisie. In their view, whatever conforms to the thoughts, psychology, and way of life of the bourgeoisie is in accordance with human nature, otherwise, it is against human nature. If a literary work writes about a character's selfishness, inner conflict, or double personality, it is in accordance with "human nature," has "human nature"; if it writes about a person who has broken free from the concept of private property and has communist moral qualities, or writes about the selflessness of the proletariat, it is "affected," lacks "human touch," and is not in accordance with "human nature." They regard bourgeois human nature as the so-called "common human nature."

Using historical idealism to oppose historical materialism, using class reconciliation to oppose class struggle, using humanism to oppose class theory, using the reactionary and decadent human nature of the bourgeoisie to oppose the revolutionary and noble human nature of the proletariat, this is the essence of the "humanism" of the revisionists.

Modern revisionists use the perspective of humanism to observe all issues, and thus also use this perspective to view the issues of peace and war. They do not distinguish between just wars and unjust wars, nor do they distinguish what class and for what purpose the war is fought, but believe that all wars are against "human nature" and "inhumane."

Peace and war are issues that concern people all over the world. People all over the world oppose the war threat of imperialism and yearn for peace. All revolutionary and progressive literature, films, and arts have played a great role in defending world peace and opposing the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. We Marxists-Leninists have always opposed the aggressive wars of imperialism. When the aggressors impose war on the people, the people can only raise the banner of anti-aggression and use just wars to stop unjust wars, using their flesh and blood to defend their homeland. The heroic and selfless actions of the people are always worthy of respect. In the history of Chinese literature, there are many moving poems that condemn the crimes of aggressive wars, and for those who resist foreign invaders, national heroes, they have always been praised and sung. Many great poets themselves are heroes who resist oppression and invasion. The Chinese people love peace, but when resisting invaders and oppressors, they are very brave. The history of the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism for more than a hundred years since the Opium War is a great epic that is worth singing and weeping for. The French _Marseillaise_ and our _March of the Volunteers_, although produced in different eras, different countries, and different classes, both stir the heart. The works created by Soviet writers such as _Iron Flow_, _Destruction_, _Chapaev_, _How Steel Is Tempered_, _The Young Guard_, _A Real Man_, and other similar themes truly portray the indomitable revolutionary will of the Soviet people and their unparalleled loyalty to their homeland and the cause of communism. These works have greatly inspired and educated the people of our country and the world.

People's writers, for the just and revolutionary wars of the people of various countries to resist aggression and oppression, can only be praised and cannot adopt any other attitude. However, in recent years, there have been some confusing phenomena in the issue of how literature and art should portray wars. Some writers have even adopted a negative attitude towards the just and anti-aggression wars in history, as if all wars, regardless of their nature, are evil and dirty. They depict such just wars as a "ghastly and tragic" picture. These authors describe in detail the cruelty and horror of war, describe the so-called "truth in the trenches," and exaggerate one-sidedly the inevitable sacrifices and deaths in war. The characters in the works seem to be passively walking to the battlefield, being toyed with by an irresistible fate, and they are controlled by a simple instinct for survival on the battlefield. They vaguely ask, "What is the meaning of life?" The authors place the theme on the irreconcilable contradiction between the cruelty of war and personal happiness, and exaggerate the protagonist's despairing psychology and tragic fate. From the overall atmosphere of these works, readers are infected with a thick sentiment of sentimentalism and pessimism about war. It seems that these authors have completely forgotten that they are describing the people's just war. In such a war, the people have shown indomitable will, unyielding spirit, and contempt for the enemy's heroic spirit, and it is the justice of the war and the noble qualities of the people that have overcome terror and death, suppressed the reactionary momentum of the enemy. In such a war, although the people have suffered heavy losses, every awakened person knows that personal sacrifices are for the freedom of the homeland, for the progress of social history and the happiness of all the people. It is this belief that drives the people to bravely rush to the battlefield, giving them an invincible spiritual power. This is an unshakable historical truth. To depict the people's just war as so gloomy and tragic, full of despairing sentiment, is a serious distortion of the historical truth of such a war. Such works can only make the people lose confidence in their own strength and the future of their homeland, only dissolve the people's will to defend their homeland, defend peace, and oppose imperialism, and are of no help to the great cause of seeking lasting world peace.

Currently, revisionism is the main danger in the world workers' movement. Revisionism in literature and art is also an international phenomenon. Continuing the struggle against revisionist ideas remains an important task for our literary and art circles. Of course, in the struggle against revisionism, we must carefully distinguish between systematic revisionist views and those who are temporarily misled by revisionism. We should thoroughly expose revisionism; for individual erroneous views, we should clarify right and wrong through criticism, making those temporarily misled comrades wake up and return to the correct stance, advancing together.

How to treat literary and artistic heritage is another issue where we have sharp differences with revisionists and bourgeois writers.

Regarding heritage, do we adopt a Marxist critical attitude, evaluating it from a comprehensive historical perspective, or do we unilaterally affirm or deny it completely? Do we take the essence and discard the dross, or do we take the dross and discard the essence? Do we innovate and break new ground, or do we cling to the old and resist change? This is the main point of contention.

Revisionists either abandon excellent classical heritage and peddle modern bourgeois decadent art, or create a fetish for bourgeois literary heritage. Both methods have the same goal: to use bourgeois literature to oppose proletarian revolutionary literature.

Hu Feng and Lukács vigorously promoted the literature of 19th-century European bourgeoisie, regarding the bourgeois humanistic thoughts they advocated in those works as the highest ideals of humanity, regarding the artistic achievements of those works as unattainable peaks, and regarding critical realism as something that is timeless, classless, and completely unrestrained by worldviews. They use the standards of bourgeois literature to measure socialist literature, belittle the achievements of socialist literature, and criticize socialist writers for not exposing the "darkness" of socialist society like critical realists, thereby losing the "critical" function of literature. Their intention in making such remarks is simply to oppose the socialist system and socialist literature. These remarks have already been refuted as they deserve.

However, there are still some self-proclaimed "Marxist" literary theorists and critics who hold a blindly worshipful attitude towards literary and artistic heritage, especially the literature and art of 19th-century European bourgeoisie. They cannot distinguish between bourgeois literature and proletarian literature. They confuse the bourgeois humanistic spirit in these works with today's socialist spirit, confuse the revolutionary nature of bourgeois literature with the revolutionary nature of proletarian literature, and confuse critical realism with socialist realism, creating a theoretical mess. They forget that the literature and art of the old era are the products of the old era and the reflections of the old era, and cannot be without historical limitations; they forget that the literature and art of 19th-century Europe are basically bourgeois literature and art, and cannot be without class limitations. They unilaterally emphasize the inheritance relationship between socialist literature and past literature, dare not criticize traditions and break through traditions, dare not admit the qualitative innovation of socialist literature.

This blind worship of literary and artistic heritage has had a bad influence in our literary and art circles and among young intellectuals. Some literary and art workers kneel before the idols of Western bourgeois art and cannot stand up straight. Some young readers, due to the lack of discernment and critical ability, are unknowingly influenced by the negative factors of bourgeois literature and art, and fall into confusion in their thoughts. Therefore, it is very necessary to correctly solve the problem of how to treat literary and artistic heritage from the perspective of Marxism-Leninism.

Marxists have always advocated a critical attitude towards cultural heritage. Lenin, when talking about inheriting cultural heritage, always talked about the need to criticize and transform it at the same time. Comrade Mao Zedong, in dealing with the problem of inheriting domestic and foreign cultural heritage, has always opposed both cutting off history and completely rejecting it, and opposed blindly absorbing it without any criticism. He advocated taking the essence and discarding the dross from the past culture. He once pointed out: "We must not reject and borrow from the ancients and foreigners, even from the feudal class and the bourgeoisie. But inheritance and borrowing should not replace our own creation, which is irreplaceable. Literary and artistic imitation of the ancients and foreigners without criticism is the most unpromising and harmful literary dogmatism and artistic dogmatism." Comrade Mao Zedong used the phrase "innovate and break new ground" to express the revolutionary development process of new literature and art, old literature and art, new traditions, and old traditions.

Based on the principle of innovating and breaking new ground, we have done a lot of work in inheriting and innovating our national literary and artistic heritage and have achieved rich results. I have already talked about this situation before. Now I want to talk about how to deal with European literary heritage. The excellent literary heritage of foreign countries, like our national heritage, is an important part of the cultural treasures of humanity and is something we must inherit and learn from. However, whether it is domestic or foreign heritage, we can only critically absorb it.

The literature and art of each era are the products of the social history of that era. Before the elimination of classes, any era and any country have literature and art that represent the reactionary and oppressive classes and literature and art that represent the progressive and oppressed classes. The literature and art of 18th and 19th-century Western bourgeoisie have a part that represents reaction, which can be studied as negative examples. We need to critically inherit and develop the tradition of progressive literature. The literature and art of 18th and 19th-century Europe and Russia have made great contributions to humanity, producing a group of great writers like Goethe, Balzac, and Tolstoy. The excellent works of critical realism and active romanticism exposed the crimes of feudalism and capitalism and, to varying degrees, expressed the emotions and wishes of the people of that time. From these works, we can understand the past society, draw on the experiences and wisdom of the people's struggles of past eras, inherit their fighting spirit and good qualities, and at the same time, the artistic techniques of depicting life in these works are also worth learning from. However, even for these works, we must adopt an analytical and critical attitude and see their negative aspects. The progressive literary works of 19th-century Europe, although they criticized capitalist society, most of them did so from the perspective of bourgeois democracy, bourgeois humanitarianism, and reformism. Although their worldviews have progressive aspects, with naive materialism and evolutionism, their class limitations ultimately restricted them, making them unable to thoroughly expose the roots of social contradictions, let alone point out the way to solve the contradictions. The characters described in these works are mostly individualistic "heroes," who either, like Julien in _The Red and the Black_, take revenge on society in despair because their personal ambitions cannot be realized, or like John Christopher, believe in the power of individual personality and take their loneliness as their greatest pride. If young readers take these characters as examples, they will not only be unable to cultivate a new collectivist personality but will instead destroy this personality and consolidate old individualistic thoughts.

By the latter half of the 19th century, the proletariat, as the gravedigger of capitalist society, armed with the most advanced ideological weapons, took the stage of history. In comparison, the critical weapons of bourgeois democracy and bourgeois humanitarianism of that era seemed very outdated and outdated. In today's socialist society, if someone, like the revisionists advocate, still wants to pick up the old spears of bourgeois humanitarianism and individualism to "criticize" the new society, expose the "darkness" of the proletariat and the people, it would be a completely anti-people and anti-socialist act.

Reactionary bourgeois writers and revisionists always take the dross and discard the essence when dealing with literary and artistic heritage, and especially promote the dross to poison the youth; we always take the essence and discard the dross. Revisionists always guide people to look back, while we always guide people to look forward. We, according to the revolutionary worldview of Marxism and historical materialism, conduct a scientific analysis of literary and artistic heritage, pointing out the significance and role of past excellent works under the historical conditions of that time, giving them a certain historical position, which is one aspect; on the other hand, we must point out their significance and role to the people under today's conditions, which is the aspect we need to pay more attention to and cannot overlook. Only by paying attention to both aspects can we avoid one-sidedness and have a complete revolutionary and historical perspective. In short, we must distinguish and analyze the works of the past of our country and foreign countries, pointing out which works, by deeply depicting the social life of that time, reflect the historical truth with moving artistic power, still have important value today and in the future and are still appreciated by readers; which works did not have a deep understanding of the social reality of that time and even had obvious distortions, and were worthless in art. For the thoughts in the works that once played a progressive role, we must also analyze them, pointing out which thoughts still have positive significance today, which thoughts are no longer applicable today, and which thoughts have become reactionary things under new historical conditions. For the learning of the techniques of the ancients, we must also make a selection and cannot mechanically follow suit. This is the Marxist historical perspective and critical attitude that we advocate.

Currently, in our literary and art circles and higher art academies, there is a focus on studying and criticizing the literature and art of 18th and 19th-century Europe. Inheriting heritage must go through research and criticism, and criticism is precisely for better inheritance. The process of criticism is a process of learning Marxism and learning heritage. Learn, criticize; learn again, criticize again; only through this repeated process can we achieve a proper critical inheritance of heritage. With the accumulation of experience in socialist cultural construction and the improvement of the communist ideological level of the people, this criticism will be more detailed and in-depth, and in the process of breaking through old traditions, new traditions will gradually be established. Criticize and learn; when criticizing, pay attention to learning, and when learning, pay attention to criticizing. When criticizing, we must break superstitions and free our minds, but it is easy to fall into a rough and rude attitude, so we must prevent roughness. When learning, it is easy to imitate and copy without criticism, so we must emphasize criticism, emphasize innovation, oppose conservatism, and oppose blind worship of the ancients and foreigners. We should learn from all excellent literary and artistic heritages of China and the world, but we must not let the literature and art of the past bind our hands and hinder our creativity.

The new era requires new literature and art. We need to draw the most beautiful pictures and write the most beautiful poems, which is the requirement of the era for us. Therefore, we must have our own new thoughts, new techniques, new artistic methods, and new creative paths. We should learn from the ancients, but we should not belittle ourselves. History is always moving forward, and the later generations should have full confidence to surpass the ancients. Because we have a new social environment, new life, and new thoughts, because the talents of the people have better development conditions than the ancients, through persistent and serious efforts, we will definitely produce batch after batch of new talents who will surpass the artistic achievements of the ancients in various aspects.

Since the founding of the country, our literary and artistic work has achieved great results. Fully affirming the achievements does not mean that everything has been done well. Compared to the requirements of the era and the people, the achievements we have already made are still far from enough. We have no reason to be complacent. Our socialist literature and art are in the process of rapid and comprehensive growth and maturity, full of vigorous and vigorous vitality, but also have the inevitable shortcomings of the growth process. The rich experience of the revolution and construction of the Chinese people has not been fully reflected and summarized in art; the ideological and artistic level of many works still cannot keep up with the increasingly improved appreciation of the masses; some works still cannot avoid the defects of formulaic and conceptual writing; the modern revisionist trend and various bourgeois ideas still have a market in the intellectual and literary circles; literary and artistic heritage still needs to be further sorted out; the experience of contemporary literature and art still needs to be further summarized; literary theory and literary criticism activities need to be greatly strengthened. The Party and the people have the right to require literary and art workers to make greater and more brilliant contributions to the new era.

Comrades! Our goal is to create great socialist and communist literature and art; our task is arduous.

We must make greater efforts to better implement the literary line stipulated by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, and in literary work, adhere to the principle of political leadership, further strengthen the leadership of the Party, which is the fundamental guarantee for the continuous victory of the literary and art cause. We must continue to fight against all tendencies that are hostile to the Party's literary line and continue to fight against revisionism and various reactionary bourgeois literary ideas. It is not allowed to cancel or relax this struggle, and to adopt an accommodating and conciliatory attitude towards bourgeois ideas.

Our path is correct. The most central and fundamental task facing all literary and art workers is to produce more and better works. Good works are power. Writers and artists! Let us sharpen our weapons and use them more accurately and skillfully, with all our heart and talent, to create works with high ideological and artistic value, to inspire the revolutionary and labor enthusiasm of the people, to improve the socialist consciousness of the people, and to cultivate people with communist moral qualities. We must strive to improve our ideological and artistic cultivation, on the one hand, seriously study the works of Marxism-Leninism and Comrade Mao Zedong, continue to go deep among the workers and peasants, participate in labor, and constantly reform and improve our thoughts; on the other hand, we must strengthen artistic practice and constantly improve artistic techniques. Writers should especially pay attention to mastering the art of language. Artistic technique is a highly skilled and delicate labor based on the writer's and artist's worldview, cultivation, and deep observation of life, and artistic processing of reality; to despise technique is to despise human labor and wisdom, which is completely wrong. Only through highly skilled techniques can the correct political thoughts and beautiful artistic forms be most perfectly combined, and artistic infectious power can be produced. We must actively develop the amateur artistic activities of workers and peasants, encourage the masses to create, and closely combine professional literary and art workers with the broad masses of amateur artistic activities. In this way, our literature and art will have the broadest mass base, and on this basis, cultivate outstanding talents in various fields of literature and art. Professional literary and art workers should constantly set higher requirements for themselves, tenfold and hundredfold improve the ideological and artistic level of their works, and strive to create works that move the hearts of millions of people. Our literature and art should not only cultivate people's communist moral qualities but also enrich people's spiritual life, making people wiser, improving their aesthetic abilities. Our literature and art should make people more noble, wiser, and more beautiful. Aesthetic education is an important aspect of communist education.

To improve the level of literary creation, we must also improve the level of literary theory and literary criticism. To more powerfully promote the healthy development of creation and the improvement of the level of works, to help the people enhance their artistic discrimination and appreciation, we need correct and powerful literary criticism. Our literary criticism stands on the Marxist standpoint, with political standards as the first, and at the same time, must conduct accurate artistic analysis of works, establish new scientific artistic standards based on the summary of modern creation experience. Our literary criticism must seriously fight against all hostile and erroneous ideological tendencies, and at the same time, boldly and enthusiastically support new works with vitality, encourage artistic originality and various different artistic styles. We oppose the rough tendencies in literary criticism, and at the same time, we must overcome the tendency of not valuing the whole work and being overly critical of individual incidents, or the vulgar trend of blindly praising. We must continue to sort out and study all excellent literary and artistic heritages, including theoretical heritages. In the history of our country, there have been many outstanding literary theorists and critics; they have summarized the rich creation experience of a certain aspect, put forward many profound insights on artistic creation. We should critically inherit this heritage, using it as the necessary research and critical material for building our Marxist literary theory. We should develop mass criticism, combining the criticism of experts with the criticism of the masses, and professional critics should be good at concentrating the opinions of the masses and raising them, truly becoming the people's literary critics. We should pay attention to cultivating the new forces of literary theory and criticism, and strive to build a strong Marxist literary theory team.

Our literary and art team is united. We should better unite all writers and artists who are willing to walk the socialist path and strive together. Various literary and art associations and all literary and art organizations should become the strong core of this unity. We should closely unite with the socialist writers and artists of the Soviet Union and other brother countries, highly carry forward the spirit of proletarian internationalism, learn from their advanced experience. We should also closely unite with all progressive and revolutionary writers and artists in the world, especially those in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, forming a broad united front of revolutionary literature and art to oppose imperialism and struggle for the common cause of lasting world peace.

My report will end here. Looking ahead, we are full of confidence in the cause of socialist literature and art. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out at the founding of the country that China will appear as a country with a high level of culture to the world. Our people have the guidance of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, the rich experience of long-term revolutionary struggle and brilliant cultural traditions, and the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution. We have the conditions to create a high level of culture. We have firmly embarked on the correct path of developing socialist literature and art. We already have a powerful revolutionary literary and art team with workers as the backbone. We have the respected Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, and other outstanding, senior revolutionary writers and artists, and we also have a large number of young literary and art workers with talent and hope who are constantly emerging from the masses. Our team is powerful. As long as we unite and strive together, always be loyal to the cause of the Party and the people, always maintain revolutionary vigor, always breathe with the workers and peasants, constantly learn, and constantly improve ourselves, we will definitely fulfill the mission entrusted to us by history and create works that are worthy of the era.

Comrades! We live in the era of the victory of socialism and communism, and we grow up in a country with a long cultural tradition. A nation that has produced Qu Yuan, Sima Qian, Du Fu, Guan Hanqing, Cao Xueqin, and Lu Xun will surely continue to produce countless brilliant literary and artistic geniuses. If our ancestors created the peaks of literature and art of various eras with their genius and struggle, then today, under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, as long as we combine individual wisdom with the collective wisdom of the masses, as long as we are willing to work hard and strive unremittingly, we will surely create a greater and new peak of literature and art than any era in the past. Let us unite closely and strive for the realization of our great goal!

    我国社会主义文学艺术的道路
    ——一九六○年七月二十二日在中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会上的报告
    周扬
    中国文学艺术工作者第三次代表大会今天开幕了。
    从一九五三年九月召开第二次代表大会到现在，已经将近七年。从一九四九年七月召开的第一次代表大会算起，已经十一年了。十年左右的时间，在人类整个历史行程中不过是一瞬，但是就在这个短短的期间，我国和世界都发生了剧烈的变化。
    我国人民连续地取得了民主革命和社会主义革命的伟大胜利，现在正在党的建设社会主义总路线的指导和鼓舞下，在工农业生产和其他各个战线上创造着伟大的成绩。我国大地上出现了一系列的新事物。社会主义经济建设以空前速度持续跃进，农村和城市人民公社正如旭日东升，千百万群众卷入了热火朝天的技术革命和文化革命运动。人民群众的精神面貌发生了无比深刻的变化。毛泽东同志十分恰当地用“精神振奋，意气风发，斗志昂扬”十二个字来形容大跃进中的中国人民。我国人民在革命斗争和生产劳动中所表现的英雄气概，他们的崇高理想和道德品质，赢得了全世界进步人类的称赞。中国正在一步一步地改变着贫弱落后的面貌，以雄伟的革命姿态，青春焕发地站立在世界上。
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的广大人民，胜利地进行着社会主义建设，正在一日千里地前进。社会主义阵营的强大，世界人民的觉悟、团结和斗争，构成了反对帝国主义、维护世界和平的有力屏障。以美国为首的帝国主义阵营正在进一步没落衰亡。美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，遭受到世界上越来越多的人民的反对。一位古巴革命诗人写过这样的诗句：
    古巴人民！学会这句英文，
    为了高呼：
    滚回去，美国人！这些愤怒的诗句代表了一切被美帝国主义蹂躏的人民的呼声。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放、民主革命运动，正在风起云涌。古巴人民革命的胜利，日本人民英勇的反美爱国斗争，阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的抗战，刚果人民奋起反对殖民主义，南朝鲜和土耳其人民推翻卖国独裁者，大大振奋了世界的人心，破除了许多人对帝国主义的恐惧心理，鼓舞了世界人民反对帝国主义的斗争勇气。在帝国主义国家内，广大人民反对垄断资本，反对法西斯主义，争取和维护民主自由，争取社会进步的正义斗争，也正在进一步展开。包括最广泛阶层的反对帝国主义战争势力、保卫世界和平的斗争，已经出现了一个新的高涨的局面。全世界被压迫民族的人民彻底粉碎帝国主义、殖民主义锁链的时刻已经到来。帝国主义最后从地球上消灭的日子已经不远了。社会主义的优良制度和共产主义的美妙理想，正吸引着世界上越来越多的人们。
    文学艺术是属于上层建筑的一种意识形态，是经济基础的反映，是阶级斗争的神经器官。在帝国主义国家，人们看到了一片骇人的精神崩溃、道德堕落的景象。这种景象也反映在这些国家的文艺作品中。今年五月间在法国举行的第十三届戛纳国际电影节上所展出的几个主要资本主义国家的影片，几乎无例外地是色情、淫乱和犯罪行为的混合物。连资产阶级的评论家也不能不慨叹地说，这是“有史以来最厚颜无耻的一次电影节”。这正是资本主义世界腐朽没落的一个投影。垄断资本家们不但使在他们控制下产生的文学、电影和艺术作品成为腐蚀和毒害人类心灵的麻醉剂，而且还通过他们雇用的文人们制造了不少赤裸裸地鼓吹侵略战争、殖民统治和种族歧视，直接为帝国主义战争势力服务的血腥的文艺。在西德和日本，随着法西斯主义和军国主义的复活，颂扬纳粹战犯、鼓吹“大和魂”的作品也纷纷出笼。在所谓“自由世界”，许多资产阶级作家、艺术家陷在无法摆脱的精神苦闷之中；他们中有的人把资本主义的末日看做世界的末日，因而恐惧不安，对人类前途感到绝望；有的人在资本主义和社会主义之间，徘徊歧路；有的人逐步突破了资产阶级世界观和各种偏见的藩篱，而转向人民的方面，社会主义的方面来。
    进步的、革命的文艺家在资本主义国家受到了种种的排斥和迫害；他们顽强地坚持斗争，创造了不少反映人民前进意志的优秀作品。各国许多爱好和平的作家、艺术家积极参加了保卫世界和平的运动。在一些卷起了民族、民主革命风暴的地方，革命的作家、艺术家站在斗争的前线，和人民共命运，真实地表达了人民要求解放的愿望。我们在这里向所有为和平、民主、民族独立和人类进步而真诚奋斗的文艺家们表示崇高的敬意。
    我们的社会主义文艺是同那些为帝国主义、反动派服务的文艺势不两立的。同资本主义的没落、颓废的文艺相对照，我们的文艺是革命的、生气勃勃的文艺，是鼓舞劳动人民起来改造世界、进行革命斗争的文艺。这种文艺描绘了广阔的人民的世界，表现了劳动群众的伟大斗争，反映了社会主义新世界的兴盛，反映了共产主义新人的诞生和成长。
    以南斯拉夫铁托集团为代表的现代修正主义者歪曲不同社会制度的国家和平共处的正确原则，大肆鼓吹所谓“积极共处”，否定社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营的对立，提倡社会主义思想体系和资本主义思想体系互相渗透和合流，千方百计地企图从思想上和政治上来瓦解社会主义阵营，取消世界人民反对帝国主义的正义斗争。为了这个目的，修正主义者配合帝国主义的宣传机关到处推销资本主义的腐烂文化和生活方式，竭力在社会主义国家的知识界、文艺界鼓励各种反马克思主义、反社会主义、反人民的思潮。在文艺战线上，社会主义国家和帝国主义国家、无产阶级和资产阶级、进步力量和反动力量之间的斗争是十分激烈的。
    革命的文艺从属于革命的政治，反动的文艺从属于反动的政治。革命的文艺家一旦离开了人民的革命事业，不管他打的是什么旗号，他就要迷失方向，走上错误的道路，走向堕落甚至走向反动。
    我国人民当前的政治任务，就是以客观上许可的、尽可能快的速度把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国，并且准备好条件以便在将来进入共产主义社会；同时，和社会主义各国人民一道，和全世界一切革命的和爱好和平的人民一道，为反对帝国主义、为争取世界持久和平尽自己最大的努力。在思想战线上，我们应当更高地举起马克思列宁主义的革命旗帜，反对现代修正主义的反动思潮，以长期的坚持不懈的斗争，在人民群众中彻底清除资产阶级的政治影响和思想影响，极大地提高人民群众的共产主义的思想觉悟和道德品质。我们的文艺应当成为以社会主义、共产主义精神，以无产阶级国际主义精神教育人民的锐利武器。
    革命的文艺家应当站在人民革命斗争的前线，站在时代的前头。
    自从第一次和第二次文代大会以来，特别是大跃进以来，我们的文学艺术工作，取得了极其重大的成就，也取得了极其丰富的经验。我们在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下找到了发展社会主义文学艺术的正确道路。在这次大会上，我们应当很好地总结我们的经验，阐明我们的文学艺术是怎样发展过来的；阐明我国社会主义文艺应当沿着什么方向、什么道路前进才是正确的，才能有利于社会主义共产主义事业，有利于社会主义文艺本身的发展；阐明在我国文艺界，无产阶级的路线和资产阶级的路线之间，共产主义的世界观和资产阶级的世界观之间，是怎样进行着尖锐的斗争的。这些就是我们这次大会所要着重探讨的问题。为工农兵服务、为社会主义事业服务
    我们的文艺是为工农兵服务、为社会主义事业服务的。自从一九四二年毛泽东同志发表著名的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》以来，文艺为工农兵服务，一直成为我国革命文艺工作者所拥护、所遵循而为之奋斗的坚定不移的方向。我们在文艺工作方面所取得的成就，就是毛泽东同志所提出的文艺方向的胜利，也就是马克思列宁主义文艺思想的胜利。
    在我国，工农劳动人民已经成为国家的主人，他们推翻了压迫者、剥削者，废除了生产资料的私有制，那些过去靠剥削为生的寄生阶级的人们也正在被改造为自食其力的劳动者。以前的个体农民、个体手工业者，经过合作化和人民公社的道路，都变成了集体农民、集体手工业者了。文学艺术不为工农劳动人民及其知识分子服务，又为谁服务呢？莫非还要为地主阶级、资产阶级去服务吗？不表现劳动人民，试问今天还有谁更值得我们去表现呢？文艺的工农兵方向，给文学艺术开辟了新的天地，使作家、艺术家找到了新的主题、新的表现对象和新的服务对象。这是人类文艺发展的方向，是文学艺术的伟大革命。
    为工农兵服务，在今天就是要为千百万群众正在轰轰烈烈地进行着的社会主义建设服务，为党的总路线服务，为伟大的共产主义的明天服务；就是要为反对帝国主义，争取世界持久和平的崇高事业服务；就是要表现我国人民在革命和建设事业中所树立的丰功伟绩，表现他们的艰苦奋斗精神和共产主义的崇高品质；就是要配合群众的技术革命和文化革命，彻底打破少数人对于文艺的垄断，使文艺为最广大的工农群众所接受和运用。
    文艺为工农兵服务，这是无产阶级的文艺方向，它同资产阶级的文艺方向针锋相对。因此它遭到了国内外一切反动派和修正主义者的敌视和痛恨。胡风说它是“一把刀子”；南斯拉夫的修正主义者诅咒它是对于作家的“迫害”。这是一点也不奇怪的。因为他们是仇视工人阶级，仇视革命的。而在资产阶级文人的眼中，文艺只是少数“上等人”的专利品，是他们的私有财产；在他们看来，文艺只应该歌颂资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子，美化资产阶级的腐朽生活，宣传资产阶级的个人主义思想和低级趣味。他们是“文艺贵族”，他们怎么愿意表现工农群众，怎么愿意为工农群众服务呢？因此，要发展社会主义文艺就不能不同资产阶级思想进行不断的斗争。从一九五一年批判电影《武训传》开始，经过对《红楼梦研究》的批判，对胡适、胡风思想的批判和胡风反革命集团的揭露，到一九五七年又进行了反对丁玲、陈企霞反党集团及其他右派分子的斗争，接着，进行了对修正主义文艺思潮的批判。文艺战线上的这一系列斗争，正是我国社会主义革命和建设时期阶级斗争在意识形态上的反映。如果说对《武训传》的批判是开国以后在文艺领域内向资产阶级思想开火的第一炮，那末，反对文艺界右派分子的斗争就是文艺战线上两条道路、两种世界观的一次具有决定意义的战斗。
    资产阶级右派分子和修正主义者总是企图按照他们的世界观和美学观来改造我们的文艺，企图把我们的文艺拉到资本主义的道路上去。为了替社会主义文艺的前进扫清道路，对资产阶级思想进行长期的反复的斗争，就是不可避免的。这是社会主义文艺发展的规律。经过这些斗争，我们的文学艺术不是像一些反动文人所断言的那样“衰萎”了，而是更加健壮了。现在，大家可以看到，我国文艺正沿着社会主义轨道飞跃前进。
    在我国，文艺已不再为少数人所专有，而成为全国各民族广大人民群众的共同事业。革命的文学、戏剧、电影和其他各种艺术已经深入人民群众的心灵。很多新的文学作品销行几十万册以至百万册以上。一九五九年电影观众达到四十一亿人次。戏曲、话剧、新歌剧、音乐、舞蹈、曲艺、杂技等各种新节目，越来越多地吸引着广泛的观众和听众。美术作品得到广大群众的欣赏，连环图画的印数每年达数千万册。劳动群众感到文艺确实是为他们服务的，它真实地反映了他们的思想、情感和愿望，是鼓舞他们劳动和斗争，提高他们道德品质的“生活教科书”。工农群众自己积极地参预了文学艺术的创造；工厂、农村、部队的业余艺术活动和业余写作运动空前广泛地开展起来。许多无名的工农作者的天才创作和文学艺术专门家的优秀作品交相辉映。文艺从来没有在人民生活中占有像现在这样重要的地位，起着这样重要的作用，并且受到人民这样的重视。文艺和劳动人民的关系变了，文艺本身的性质也变了；我们的文艺已经逐步成为劳动人民自己的文艺。
    强烈而鲜明的革命性和战斗性是我们的文艺的最显著的特色。文艺工作者，作为时代的鼓手，运用各种文艺形式，敏锐地反映了我国人民反对帝国主义，保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的斗争，反映了祖国建设的各个战线上不断涌现的新人新事，热情地描绘了新事物在斗争中的成长，显示了文艺密切配合政治的积极作用。不少优秀的作品对我国人民的革命历史和现实斗争作了广泛的描绘和艺术概括。《红旗谱》、《青春之歌》、《三家巷》、《灵泉洞》、《苦菜花》、《铁道游击队》、《红日》、《林海雪原》、《三里湾》、《山乡巨变》、《创业史》、《草原烽火》、《黎明的河边》、《战斗的幸福》等小说，《杨高传》、《赶车传》、《动荡的年代》等长篇叙事诗，《万水千山》、《红色风暴》、《英雄万岁》、《东进序曲》、《槐树庄》等戏剧，《上甘岭》、《林则徐》、《风暴》、《聂耳》、《青春之歌》、《董存瑞》、《战火中的青春》等电影，展现了我国从鸦片战争一直到社会主义革命各个阶段惊天动地的人民革命斗争的历史。《百炼成钢》、《在和平的日子里》、《乘风破浪》、《风雨的黎明》、《风雪之夜》、《我的第一个上级》等小说，《降龙伏虎》、《全家福》、《共产主义凯歌》等戏剧，《老兵新传》、《黄河飞渡》、《春满人间》、《万紫千红总是春》、《五朵金花》等电影，描绘了工农业建设和大跃进中各个战线上沸腾的生活图景。
    工农群众中的先进人物已经成为我们文艺作品中主要的主人公。在许多优秀的小说、电影、戏剧、绘画和其他各种艺术作品中，塑造了工人、农民、战士、革命干部、革命知识分子的英雄形象。作家艺术家把自己的理想熔铸在英雄人物的创造上，在艺术作品中表现了新的世界、新的人物、新的思想。从近年来的创作中可以看出一个明显的趋势：作家对于人民群众改造世界的革命精神和宏伟气魄，描写得越来越鲜明和深刻，对人物性格的刻划也更加细致和丰满了。我们在《红旗谱》中看到了在漫长的黑暗统治年代，老一代的革命农民向反动势力冲锋陷阵的悲壮历史。在朱老忠身上，集中地体现了农民对地主的世世代代的阶级仇恨，体现了为党所启发、所鼓励的农民的革命要求。《苦菜花》以敌后抗日根据地复杂的残酷斗争为背景，刻划了一个善良而又勇敢的革命母亲的形象。《万水千山》中的那位红军教导员李有国，一生为党为革命，临死之前还充满信心地高呼“让革命骑着马前进”，他的面影在我们的脑海中留下了难忘的印象。《红日》刻划了沈振新这样一位高级指挥员，他肩负着一个决定性战役的胜败的重担，而从容不迫，指挥若定。在《林海雪原》中的战士杨子荣身上概括了革命侦察战士的机智勇敢的作风。《创业史》深刻地描写了农村合作化过程中激烈的阶级斗争和农村各个阶层人物的不同面貌，塑造了一个坚决走社会主义道路的青年革命农民梁生宝的真实形象。《百炼成钢》中的秦德贵，《山乡巨变》中的邓秀梅以及《新结识的伙伴》、《李双双小传》中的主人公们，都是十分活跃的工农青年的形象。
    这些人物的创造，回答了谁是我们时代的英雄这个问题，说明了工人阶级和劳动人民在我们文艺作品中已经取得了应有的地位。
    劳动群众本来是人类文明和社会财富的创造者，但是由于他们在政治上经济上长期处于被压迫、被剥削的境地，在过去的文艺作品中，他们常常不是被忽略就是被歪曲。随着工人阶级登上历史舞台，工人阶级就要求文艺正确地表现劳动人民，要求文艺成为工人阶级的斗争武器。
    早在十九世纪四十年代，恩格斯看到狄更斯、乔治·桑、欧仁·苏等作家的作品中描写了“穷人和受轻视的阶级”，曾大加称赞，认为这种现象是欧洲小说领域中的“一个彻底的革命”。（《大陆上的运动》，《马克思恩格斯全集》第一卷）后来，到八十年代，他向革命作家正式提出了表现工人阶级的革命斗争的任务。他说，这种革命斗争的描写应该“在现实主义的领域中要求一个地位”（《给哈克纳斯的信》，《马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林论文艺》）。到了列宁的时代，无产阶级革命风暴的中心移到了俄国，列宁在著名的《党的组织和党的文学》中，进一步提出了党的文学的口号，指出：“文学事业应当成为无产阶级总的事业的一部分”，社会主义文学应当“为千百万劳动人民服务”。正是列宁，他第一次制定了无产阶级文学艺术的战斗纲领。
    我国革命的新文艺，是在伟大的十月革命的感召下产生的，是世界无产阶级社会主义文学艺术的一部分。中国共产党在它诞生以后不久，就适应革命斗争的需要提出了创造革命文艺的主张。鲁迅、瞿秋白和许多革命的文艺家曾经为了给无产阶级文艺开辟道路而披荆斩棘，甚至流血牺牲。毛泽东同志根据中国革命的具体实践，创造性地发展了列宁关于党的文学的原则，明确地指出了文艺为工农兵服务的方向。这就使我国的文艺发生了根本的历史性的变革。
    毛泽东同志对马克思主义文艺理论的伟大贡献，不但在于最明确最透辟地提出了文艺为什么人的问题，还在于从根本上解决了如何为的问题。毛泽东同志从各方面探索了文艺为劳动人民服务的途径，规定了文艺的普及和提高的辩证关系，而把一切问题的中心放在文艺工作者同工农群众结合、从而改造自己的世界观这个根本问题上。文艺工作者只有和工农群众打成一片，才能找到最丰富的创作源泉，才能熟悉新的生活和新的人物，才有可能写出真实地表现工农群众，并为群众所喜爱的、有益于人民的作品。新的时代给了我们的文学艺术以新的任务，新时代的文艺家不能不走一条同旧时代的文艺家根本不同的新的生活和创作的道路，这就是同工农群众结合的道路。只有这样，才有可能使非无产阶级出身的知识分子文艺家，改变原来的世界观，树立共产主义的世界观，成为真正的工人阶级的代言人。就是工农出身的或者在新社会培养出来的青年文艺家也需要不断进行改造，和工农群众保持长期的紧密的联系。一旦他们脱离了群众，脱离了革命斗争和生产劳动，就会经受不住资产阶级思想的侵袭，而误入歧途，有的人甚至可能堕入反社会主义的泥坑。刘绍棠就是一个例子。所以文艺工作者的工农化是文艺的工农兵方向的根本关键。
    一九五七年整风和反右派斗争以后，文艺工作者大批地下乡下厂，参加劳动和基层工作，这对促进文艺工作者进一步同劳动人民结合，促进他们的世界观、生活方式和文艺观点的改变，起了决定的作用。文艺工作者在参加劳动的实践中才真正体会了“劳动是光荣的”这句话的深刻意义。他们不是以文艺家的特殊身份去“体验生活”，而是以普通劳动者的姿态和群众一同生活、工作和劳动。他们从同劳动人民的进一步接触中熟悉了自己所要服务、所要描写的对象，和劳动人民有了共同的感受和语言，而且由于受到劳动人民崇高品质的感染而大大提高了自己的革命觉悟。他们窥见了劳动人民的心灵世界，知道了应当如何去表现劳动人民；他们明白了人民需要什么，应当为人民创作什么。一个作家如果不热爱工农群众，不熟悉群众的生活、情感、语言，如何写得出真实地表现工农群众的生动的作品呢？几年来，许多优秀作品可以说都是具有丰富斗争经验和熟悉群众生活的作家、艺术家们的创造。由于世界观的改造，政治觉悟的提高，很多老作家、老艺术家加入了中国共产党。同时，从工农群众和干部中涌现了大批新的文艺力量。一支以工人阶级的作家、艺术家为骨干的强大的革命文艺队伍已经成长起来。
    “教育者必须受教育”，文艺工作者要通过创作实践以共产主义精神教育人民，首先应当通过生活实践向人民群众学习，学习他们的优良品质，学习他们的劳动精神和斗争精神，把书本上的抽象的共产主义变为具体的有血有肉的共产主义。文艺工作者深入工农群众，参加劳动的过程，是一个熟悉工农群众的过程，同时更重要的是改造自己的世界观的过程。因为只有参加革命斗争和生产斗争，共产主义的世界观才能成为作家、艺术家的灵魂。同时也只有参加生产劳动，才能使我们的文艺工作者，特别是青年文艺工作者逐步摆脱由于脑力劳动和体力劳动的分离所造成的片面性和狭隘性，使自己成为全面发展的共产主义新人。那种认为参加体力劳动会糟蹋艺术人才的观点，是错误的；这只能说明抱有这种观点的人轻视劳动罢了。事实上，正是在劳动者的队伍中蕴藏着无数的天才，而参加劳动又正是锻炼和培养工人阶级的各种人才的最好途径。
    文艺为工农兵服务是最彻底最坚决的无产阶级的文艺方向，它要求文艺为最广大的工农群众服务，要求文艺表现工农群众，而最根本的是要求文艺工作者工农化，彻底改造自己的世界观。
    随着基础的改变，上层建筑也必然改变。但是属于上层建筑的意识形态的改变要比基础的改变缓慢得多。因此，在社会主义社会建立以后，资产阶级的政治影响和思想影响还将长期存在，即使到了共产主义社会，还会有先进和落后、正确和错误的斗争，这就决定了思想斗争和思想改造是长期的任务。十年来资产阶级思想在我国是不断受到批判的，修正主义在我国文艺界没有能够占据主要地位，但并不是说它们已经不存在了，它们是看气候行事的，只要国内外有一点风吹草动，它们又会兴风作浪，像渣滓一样浮上水面，乘机散布毒素。国际上的修正主义思潮，也不可能不在我国发生影响。因此，我们要坚持文艺为工农兵服务、为社会主义事业服务的方向，就必须坚持跟敌视这个方向的修正主义和其他各种资产阶级思想进行斗争。
    百花齐放、百家争鸣
    文艺为广大劳动人民服务、为社会主义、共产主义的伟大事业服务，是我国文艺的唯一政治方向，除此以外，再不应该有第二个方向。但是在艺术的风格、形式、体裁和题材等方面，我们提倡多样化，鼓励自由创造，而反对千篇一律、刻板和狭隘化。我们的原则是政治方向的一致性和艺术风格多样性的统一。毛泽东同志根据对于社会主义社会人民内部矛盾的科学分析提出了百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针。在为工农兵服务、为社会主义事业服务的方向下实行百花齐放、百家争鸣和推陈出新，这就是我国社会主义文学艺术发展的道路。实践证明，这是发展我国社会主义文艺的最正确、最宽广、最富于创造性的道路。这条道路把各种不同流派和风格的作家、艺术家的全部才能和创造性引导到一个共同的伟大的目标上去，并且使作家、艺术家的个人智慧和群众的集体智慧结合起来。
    百花齐放、推陈出新，是毛泽东同志在开国初期为革新和发展我国戏曲艺术而提出的口号。这个口号，促进了我国戏曲事业的空前繁荣。一九五六年，毛泽东同志把百花齐放和百家争鸣并列提出，作为发展文艺和科学的方针；这个方针很快地推广到了政治、思想的各个战线。大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论成为我国人民群众进行自我教育和自我批评的良好方法，成为在人民群众的政治生活中贯彻群众路线、发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性的良好方法，同时也成为人民群众对敌人进行斗争的有力武器。
    百花齐放、百家争鸣和推陈出新的方针，促进了文学艺术各个门类全面的多样化的发展，促进了旧传统的革新。我们为着继承和发展本国文学艺术遗产，进行了大量的、卓有成效的工作。我们使解放前濒于绝境或早已绝迹于舞台的几百个地方剧种恢复了青春；数以万计的戏曲剧本和民间说唱文学重见天日；浩如烟海的各民族的民歌、民间叙事诗和民间故事得到记录、整理和出版；丰富多采的民间音乐、舞蹈和民间美术得到普遍的扶持和发展。我们打开了一座又一座长期被埋没的民族、民间艺术的宝库，拭去了淤积在它们身上的尘土，在马克思主义思想的照耀下，去芜存菁，使它们焕然一新，发出夺目的光彩。许多经过整理和改编的优秀的传统剧目和歌舞、杂技、木偶、皮影等节目，赢得了广大观众的赞美。《十五贯》、《生死牌》、《穆桂英挂帅》、《杨门女将》、《搜书院》、《芙奴传》、《父子恨》、《墙头马上》、《追鱼》及其他许多经常上演的优秀的戏曲剧目，是戏曲界实践百花齐放、推陈出新的成果。许多戏曲从剧本到表演，都有了显著的革新。我们以新的智慧和技巧丰富了前人的成就。这不是单纯的整理遗产，而是一种新的创造。运用传统戏曲形式表现现代题材，也获得了成功的经验，产生了如《红色的种子》、《鸡毛飞上天》、《冬去春来》等不少受欢迎的剧目。在我们的舞台上，全国各个剧种出现了很多才华焕发的优秀青年演员。曲艺作为文艺的尖兵，为迅速反映当前革命斗争作了有益的贡献。国画家们运用传统技法真实而自然地描绘了新时代的生活和祖国的自然风景，使中国画获得了新的生命。工艺美术和建筑艺术既保持了民族色彩，又显示了新时代的风貌，因而博得人们的赞赏。
    百花齐放、推陈出新的方针，不但促进了旧传统的革新，而且促进了新文艺的进一步民族化。小说家在语言的运用、性格的刻划、情节结构的布局等方面，越来越多地显示了民族的风格。诗人们在新民歌运动的冲激下，努力于在古典诗歌和民歌的基础上发展新诗，使诗风为之一变。各种绘画和雕刻，都越来越具有鲜明的民族特点。新歌剧不但表现了新的革命的内容，形式也更加民族化了，产生了像《小二黑结婚》、《洪湖赤卫队》这样一些好剧目。音乐方面，创作了许多具有民族色彩的器乐曲和声乐作品，表现了大跃进时代人民群众的革命热情。《宝莲灯》、《小刀会》、《五朵红云》是创造民族舞剧的新尝试。话剧和电影都在民族化方面作了许多努力。
    百花齐放、推陈出新的方针促进了我国各少数民族文艺的迅速发展。现在各少数民族中间已经出现了不少有才能的作家、诗人和艺术家。少数民族的文艺遗产也是丰富的；经过整理的民间叙事诗，如《嘎达梅林》、《阿诗玛》、《召树屯》等是人民诗歌艺术的珍宝。一些优秀的民歌和民间传说，如《刘三姐》、《秦娘美》成功地搬上了舞台。不少兄弟民族开始创造了本民族的歌剧和话剧。
    由于实行了百花齐放、推陈出新的方针，我国文学艺术的形式和体裁更多样化了，题材的范围更扩大了。长篇小说和短篇小说、散文、特写，多幕剧和独幕剧，交响乐、大合唱和群众歌曲、民歌，油画、雕塑、国画和版画、宣传画、漫画，故事片和新闻纪录片、科学教育片、美术片以及摄影作品等都发挥了各自的功能和创造，各有千秋。我们重视精心结构的鸿篇巨制，同样，也重视短小精悍的匕首、投枪式的作品。我们的文艺作品不但着重地表现了现实的斗争，塑造了当代英雄的形象，而且以新的观点再现了历史上的杰出人物。《关汉卿》、《蔡文姬》、《文成公主》等就是取材于古代历史的成功剧作。少年儿童文学和儿童戏剧以负有用共产主义精神教育后一代的责任而受到了特别的重视。
    在百花齐放和推陈出新的方针指导下，一方面继承和革新我国优秀文学艺术遗产，使它们成为先进的社会主义文化的一部分；另一方面使各种形式和体裁的新文艺具有更耀目的民族特色，两方面互相接近，互相结合，共同发展为多种多样的社会主义的民族新文艺。
    毛泽东同志早在二十年前就提倡要树立新鲜活泼的、为中国老百姓所喜闻乐见的中国作风和中国气派。我国文学艺术有几千年的传统，积累了丰富的创造经验，形成了自己长期流传的民族的形式和风格。革命的文艺如果不具有民族特点，不在自己民族传统的基础上创造同新内容相适应的新的民族形式，就不容易在广大群众中生根开花。文艺的民族化和群众化是互相联系而不可分的。我国的文学艺术，从“五四”以来，大量地吸收了外国文学艺术的经验，采用了许多外来艺术形式和表现手法，这是完全必要的。建国以来，随着对外文化交流的发展，经过翻译家们的努力，我们更大量地接触了世界各国，特别是苏联和其他兄弟国家的文学、电影和艺术的优秀成果，吸取了于我们有用的东西，这对我国广大读者、观众和文艺界都带来了很大的好处。但是一切外来的艺术形式和手法移植到中国来的时候都必须加以改造、融化，使它具有民族的色彩，成为自己民族的东西。现在我国文学艺术正越来越表现出民族化、群众化的特点。文艺的民族独创性，是人民群众的创造性的集中表现，是一个时代、一个阶级的文学艺术成熟的标志。
    百花齐放使群众的精神创造力得到了空前的解放。随着大跃进和文化革命形势的出现，掀起了一个群众文艺创作的高潮。在工地上，在农村里，诗画满墙，歌声遍野。新民歌、新壁画是大跃进的产物，又反过来推动了大跃进。它们的革命浪漫色彩和豪迈清新的风格，正是反映了我们时代的色彩和群众的风格。革命回忆录和工厂史、公社史的写作运动，在干部、知识分子和工农群众的合作下，得到了广泛的开展。集体创作已成为我们的文学艺术创造活动的一种重要形式，成为在文艺工作中贯彻群众路线的一种重要方法。工农群众和革命干部创造了历史，今天他们拿起笔来写自己的历史了。《星火燎原》、《北方的红星》、《红色的安源》、《绿树成荫》等就是第一批可贵的果实。我们的文艺是由专业作家的创作和群众业余的创作两个部分组成的，这两个部分共同构成了我国文学艺术绚烂壮丽的全景。
    百家争鸣促进了文艺界、思想界自由辩论和群众批评的活跃开展。我们通过辩论展开了文艺上两条道路的斗争，同时对文艺创作上和理论上的许多问题进行了有益的商讨。通过这些辩论，马克思主义的观点在文艺理论和文艺批评中取得了巩固的地位。近两年来，在各地高等学校的文科和艺术院校展开了对文艺教学中的资产阶级学术思想的批判，在这个批判的基础上，学生和教师合作，写出了一批文艺理论和文学史、艺术史的著作，标志着马克思主义新生力量的迅速成长。
    从以上各方面都可以看出，在文艺工作中执行百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针已经收到了可观的成效，实践证明了这个方针的正确性。但是在开始提出这个方针的时候，远不是所有的人都具有信心，不仅如此，曲解这个方针和反对这个方针的人是并不少的。
    帝国主义者及其奴仆——资产阶级右派分子和修正主义者们，曾经妄想百花齐放、百家争鸣是一个资产阶级的“自由化”的方针，是对一切资产阶级思想和反社会主义的毒草实行“宽容”和“忍让”的方针。当他们为自己的主观估计所蔽，在一九五七年下半年碰得头破血流以后，他们就改变了腔调，硬说我们放弃了百花齐放、百家争鸣，硬说这个方针不过是一个时候的策略和手段。这些老爷们的阶级本性把他们的眼睛完全蒙蔽了，有甚么办法能使他们正确地理解无产阶级的马克思主义的政策呢？
    我们从来主张，百花齐放是在社会主义范围内的百花齐放，是放社会主义之花，是通过自由竞赛的方法发展社会主义的文艺，反对反社会主义的文艺；百家争鸣是在马克思列宁主义思想指导下的百家争鸣，是通过自由辩论的方法宣扬和发展马克思主义的辩证唯物主义，反对资产阶级的唯心主义和形而上学。所以，百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，是迅速发展我国文艺和科学的最正确的方针，不但有利于正确处理意识形态领域内人民的内部矛盾，而且有利于同资产阶级文艺和伪科学进行较量和斗争。正如刘少奇同志所说的，百花齐放、百家争鸣是无产阶级的极端坚定的阶级政策。
    资产阶级右派分子和修正主义者企图利用百花齐放的口号来大放他们的反社会主义的毒草。在他们眼中，我们所有的花都不算花。像那些具有嗜痂逐臭之癖的人们一样，他们专门欣赏没落颓废的资本主义艺术，把它当作香花。世界观不同，美的观点也就不同。我们认为香花的，他们看作毒草，我们认为毒草的，他们看作香花。他们要我们把毒草当作香花供奉，这当然是做不到的。我们同修正主义者和资产阶级文人在这个问题上的主要分歧和争论之点就在这里。
    在百花齐放、百家争鸣的问题上，我们和教条主义者也是有分歧的。教条主义者脱离群众，脱离实际，不懂得辩证法，不承认世界的多样性。他们只要政治方向的一致性而不要艺术风格的多样化，只许一花独放，不要百花齐放。这是非常有害的。
    在社会主义花园中，难道可以只有一种花吗？牡丹被称为花中之王，但是只放牡丹花，而不许其他的花开放，那么牡丹虽好，不也要使人觉得单调吗？单调的生活和单调的艺术，都是人们所不喜欢的。人民的生活本来是丰富多彩的，反映人民生活的文学艺术也应该丰富多彩。在我们的社会中，劳动人民由于物质生活日益改善，精神生活日益丰富，他们对物质产品和精神产品的要求也将日益增长，不但要求这些产品有更多的数量，而且要求有更多的品种和更好的质量。由于人们的需要、兴趣和爱好不同，品种是越多越好。只有多样化的艺术才能满足群众不断增长的、多方面的精神需要，才能使各个作家、艺术家的不同的个性和才能得到充分的发挥。文艺必须为政治服务；政治是十分广阔的领域；文艺为政治服务的途径和方式应当是多种多样的。我们提倡具有高度革命思想内容和完美艺术形式的作品。我们提倡文艺作品表现现实斗争的题材，并且鼓励和帮助文艺工作者努力去接近和熟悉人民的新生活，投入人民火热的斗争。同时，每个作家、艺术家都可以根据自己的政治责任心，根据个人的生活经验、兴趣和特长来决定选取甚么题材和采取甚么表现形式。新时代的读者、观众和听众爱读反映同时代人的生活和斗争的火辣辣的作品，也爱看舞台上演出的引人入胜的历史和传说的故事；爱听动人心弦的战斗进行曲，也喜欢优美而健康的抒情音乐和抒情舞蹈。新时代需要有更多壮美的革命历史画、革命风俗画和人物画，但是新风格的山水画和花鸟画，在我们的画苑中，难道不应当同样有它们的地位吗？人们在精神生活上需要振奋，也需要愉悦。只要不违背毛泽东同志在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中所规定的六项政治标准，最主要的就是只要不违反社会主义的道路和共产党的领导，各种形式、题材和风格的艺术作品都可以得到发展。我们主张通过批评和竞赛的方法，使思想上错误或艺术上低劣的作品逐步淘汰，使作品的思想水平和艺术水平逐步提高起来，文艺上的社会主义竞赛是鼓励艺术风格多样化、发展艺术流派、促进作品质量提高的最好的方法。
    要放百花，毒草就可能冒充香花而出现，因此，百花齐放、百家争鸣的内容，必然包含放百花和锄毒草两个互相对立而又互相联系的方面。
    放百花是人民内部问题。人民内部先进和落后、正确和错误的矛盾，是会永远存在的。要解决这类矛盾问题，只能采取讨论、说服、比较和竞赛的方法，不能采取行政命令的、强制的方法。在学术问题、艺术问题上，我们反对武断，反对压服，反对粗暴批评，而主张经过充分的讨论来明辨是非，逐步达到正确的结论。学术的是非和艺术的工拙，往往需要很长时间才能作出确定的结论和评价。有些新出现的事物往往一时不容易辨明是香花还是毒草，有些香花也可能包含局部的缺点，因此，不但识别毒草需要眼力，识别香花也需要眼力；不但拔除毒草需要勇气；保护香花也需要勇气。为了扶植新生事物的成长，为了防止思想僵化，我们应当提倡活泼的自由争辩的风气，提倡敢想敢说敢做的风格，鼓励人民群众的创造性，鼓励作家和批评家在创作上和理论上的革新勇气和独创精神。
    锄毒草，是敌我问题。毒草是一种客观存在，它的出生是一定历史条件决定的。要它不发生、不出现，是办不到的。问题是，要消除毒草之害，用甚么方法最有效呢？修正主义者是反对跟毒草斗争的；他们是各种毒草的保护者；修正主义思潮本身就是一种危害性最大的毒草。他们鼓吹在文化思想战线上采取自由放任，“宽容”、“忍让”的政策，其目的就是要让社会主义国家容许资本主义反动文化合法存在，自由泛滥，来毒害人民，毒害青年。这当然是我们所坚决反对的。另一方面，我们也不赞成教条主义者的办法。教条主义者一见毒草出现就把它禁止，这种简单的行政命令的方法，虽然可以收到一时的效果，却贻后患于无穷。这实际上是允许毒草暂时潜伏地下，或者让它以伪装面目出来害人，这是变相的放任主义，是不能致敌人于死命的。我们的方针是，毒草冒出头来，就把它作为对立面，让它和群众见面，放手发动群众讨论，以便更多的群众认清它的真面目，增强群众的辨别力和战斗力。我们始终信任和依靠群众的力量；我们坚信真理最后必然战胜谬误。因此，我们不怕毒草，不怕反面的意见，不怕进行公开的辩论，不怕正确的意见在一个时候遭到攻击或误解。反右派斗争的经验证明了我们的这种作法是完全正确的。这场斗争的结果，人民群众，包括广大青年学生，不但没有被右派拉过去，而且正是通过群众的辩论，依靠群众的力量，彻底地击溃了右派。同时，实践证明，群众的辩论和批判，对于帮助资产阶级知识分子进行思想改造也是一副虽然苦口但是见效的良药。
    在为工农兵服务、为社会主义事业服务的方向下实行百花齐放、百家争鸣，既反对了修正主义，又反对了教条主义；既保证了文学艺术的政治方向的一致性，又保证了文学艺术风格的多样性；既引导作家、艺术家同工农群众结合，树立革命的世界观，又给与作家、艺术家以充分机会来发挥他们的艺术独创性。所以，我们认为这是一条发展我国社会主义文艺的最正确的道路。
    革命现实主义和革命浪漫主
            义的结合
    为了文艺能更好地反映我们的时代，更有力地为广大劳动人民服务，为社会主义、共产主义的伟大事业服务，我们提倡革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的艺术方法。
    这个艺术方法的提出，是毛泽东同志对马克思主义文艺理论的又一重大贡献。毛泽东同志是根据马克思主义关于不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的思想，根据文学艺术本身的发展规律，从当前革命斗争的需要出发提出这个方法来的，他把革命气概和求实精神相结合的原则运用在文学艺术上，把文学艺术中现实主义和浪漫主义这两种艺术方法辩证地统一起来，以便更有利于表现我们今天的时代，有利于全面地吸取文学艺术遗产中的一切优良传统，有利于更好地发挥作家、艺术家不同的个性和风格，这样，就给社会主义文学艺术开辟了一个广阔自由的天地。这两种精神的结合，不只适用于文艺创作，也适用于文艺批评。
    首先，我们说一说社会主义文艺中的革命理想问题。我们所说的革命的浪漫主义，其基本精神就是革命的理想主义，是革命的理想主义在艺术方法上的表现。
    我们的文学艺术的思想基础是马克思列宁主义。马克思列宁主义的哲学是最彻底的革命的哲学，它把冷静的科学分析和热烈的革命精神、群众的斗争实践结合起来。马克思主义者是最清醒的革命现实主义者，同时又是最富于理想的革命理想主义者。我们马克思主义者和机械唯物论者根本不同之点就在于：我们在对客观现实的正确认识的基础上充分地重视主观能动性，重视先进思想和科学预见，重视革命幻想的巨大意义。一个无产阶级革命战士，赴汤蹈火，坚贞不屈，不正是由于崇高的理想在鼓舞他吗？对我们来说，改造世界的革命事业是没有止境的，今天的理想，是明天的现实，而明天又会有新的更高的理想激励着我们继续前进。我们的斗争和劳动，就是为了不断地把先进的理想变为现实。
    无产阶级革命导师，从来都是凭着科学预见和革命理想，看清历史前进的航线的。大家知道，列宁在《怎么办？》一书中提出过“要幻想！”他在一九○七年为马克思致库格曼书信集俄译本所写的序言中，对于当时俄国的那些一碰到革命低潮就赶快抛弃“革命幻想”而从事“现实主义”小事情的机会主义者先生们、那些“大骂革命浪漫主义的‘现实主义’的聪明才子们”，予以无情的抨击。毛泽东同志在中国革命遭受严重挫折、暂时处于低潮的年代就预见到“星星之火，可以燎原”，他用诗一般的语言，宣告一个更伟大、更壮丽的、如同“光芒四射喷薄欲出的一轮朝日”的革命高潮就要到来。正是这种高瞻远瞩的革命幻想在人类历史发展过程中起了无可估量的作用。
    在每个时代，每个阶级都有自己的理想，都曾在它的文学艺术中根据自己的崇高理想和道德标准塑造了一系列的英雄人物。从整个文学历史上，我们可以看到，世界各民族都有自己千百年流传下来歌颂英雄的诗篇。我国过去的文学作品创造了不少各个时代的英雄人物的典型，这些人物的不平凡的性格和不平凡的事迹在人民群众中传颂不绝。西方资产阶级的文学，在资本主义的上升时期，也曾描绘了一些体现资产阶级革命思想的正面人物。但是到了十九世纪中叶以后，资产阶级所宣传的理想就完全破灭了，资产阶级作家就再也写不出他们本阶级的出色的人物了。在现代反动资产阶级作家的作品中，充斥着色情狂、颓废主义者、精神分裂者、仇恨人类的人以至流氓、骗子、强盗、杀人犯等等，这就是今天正在走向灭亡的资产阶级心目中的“英雄”。到了无产阶级革命的时代，新英雄人物只能是无产阶级和革命人民中的先进分子。创造新英雄人物，就成了社会主义文艺的光荣任务。
    我们的文艺应当创造最能体现无产阶级革命理想的人物。这些人物并不是作家头脑中空想的产物，而是实际斗争中涌现出来的新人。他们的最可贵的品质，就表现在他们不但不为困难所吓倒而退却，也决不满足于已经取得的胜利而停步不前。他们抱着社会主义的理想完成了艰巨的民主革命，今天又在更高的共产主义理想鼓舞下进行着伟大的社会主义建设。崇高的理想和艰苦的斗争，培养和锻炼了他们的高尚品质和坚强性格。他们永远前进，永远走在生活的最前面。这是社会主义的、共产主义的新人，是推动时代前进的先进力量。
    资产阶级反动作家和修正主义者攻击我们的文学艺术，正是因为他们痛恨我们的文学艺术中所表现的革命理想和具有这种革命理想的新的人物。他们不喜欢社会主义的现实，更不喜欢社会主义的、共产主义的新人，他们不相信科学的共产主义的伟大理想和革命斗争的伟大现实能够培育出无数我们时代的最崇高、最优秀的人物，一些具有资产阶级偏见的作家总是认为：我们所描写的人民群众中的先进人物是不真实的，只有灰色的
  “小人物”或者卑劣的反面人物才是“真实”的。他们的论据是：每一个人都有缺点和毛病，每一个人的心灵深处都隐藏着光明和黑暗的斗争，这就是他们的所谓“内心的复杂性”。我们反对把人物的内心简单化。新时代人物的内心生活，正是最丰富而又最健康的。他们知道应当如何对待劳动，对待友谊，对待爱情，对待家庭生活；他们当然也有苦恼和内心矛盾，也会有这样或那样的缺点，犯这样或那样的错失，但是他们总是努力把共产主义的思想和道德作为他们一切行动的最高准则。资产阶级作家们所提倡描写的甚么“内心的复杂性”和新时代劳动人民的丰富的内心生活有甚么共同之处呢？他们所要揭开的所谓“人的心灵的秘密”，只不过是他们自己的阴暗心灵的自我流露罢了。他们热中于写缺乏意志的人和他们的身边琐事，看不见或不愿意表现今天的英雄人物和伟大斗争，或者把资产阶级卑鄙空虚的心灵硬装到社会主义、共产主义的新人身上去。他们的作品中弥漫着灰暗阴郁的色调，把社会主义社会的新生活、人民群众的战斗生活涂成一片漆黑。他们这样做的后果，势必引起人们对社会主义现实的失望，促使社会主义国家的人民在精神上发生瓦解和崩溃。这正是符合帝国主义的愿望的。只要看一看帝国主义文艺评论家们的论调就十分清楚了。他们或者为了在我们社会主义国家中有人把“多余的人”带到社会主义文学中来而十分高兴，或者唆使社会主义国家的作家去追求“世界的悲剧性的梦幻”。帝国主义者和修正主义者，是怎样企图把资产阶级的腐败思想，绝望情绪，灌输到社会主义文学艺术中来呵。如果他们的企图得逞，社会主义文艺就将堕落成为资产阶级反动颓废文艺的变种，而不再是什么革命的文艺了。
    每个作家都应当有自己的理想。当然，理想是有各种各样的：有远大的和渺小的，正确的和错误的，革命的和反动的。只有符合客观现实的发展行程，符合最大多数人民利益的理想才是正确的理想。在今天，人类的最高革命理想，就是实现共产主义。帝国主义者和各种反动派也有他们的“理想”，那就是保存和扩张资本主义，抵制和消灭社会主义。我们的作家、艺术家应当站在共产主义这一时代最高理想的峰顶来观察生活、描写生活，培养人民的共产主义道德品质，清除旧时代所遗留的各种旧思想、旧习惯的影响。和解放全人类的伟大目标相比，一切其他的个人愿望都是渺小而不足道的。共产主义理想应当是我们文艺创作的灵魂。
    我们这样强调文艺中的革命理想，会不会损害文艺的真实性呢？
    关于“真实”，关于“现实主义”，我们和修正主义者之间存在着截然不同的理解。修正主义者常常在“写真实”和
  “现实主义”的幌子下，反对社会主义文艺的倾向性。他们故意把真实性和倾向性对立起来，认为倾向性会妨碍真实性。其实他们所反对的只是文艺的革命倾向性，目的是要代之以资产阶级的反动倾向性。他们排除生活中的先进理想，他们的所谓现实主义，是没有先进理想的“现实主义”，实际上不是现实主义，而是卑琐的自然主义或颓废主义。他们的所谓“真实”，其实是对于现实的歪曲。我们从来主张文艺必须真实，反对虚伪的文艺。但是我们却不是“为真实而真实”论者。在阶级社会中，文艺家总是带着一定阶级的倾向来观察和描写现实的，而只有站在先进阶级和人民群众的立场，才能最深刻地认识和反映时代的真实。人民的作家选择和描写什么题材，首先就要考虑是否于人民有益。真实性和革命的倾向性，在我们是统一的。
    说到现实主义，我们不能不引证恩格斯的有名定义：“现实主义是除了细节的真实之外，还要真实地再现典型环境中的典型性格。”（《给哈克纳斯的信》）这是恩格斯在给一位女作家的信中说的话。在这封信中，恩格斯批评了那位女作家把伦敦的工人写得太消极，认为这样的工人形象对于经过了几十年斗争的伦敦工人阶级来说，是不够典型的。从这个定义，我们可以得出什么结论呢？第一，现实主义不能只注意琐碎的细节的真实，细节的真实必须服从于典型化的原则；第二，恩格斯要求作家表现“典型环境中的典型性格”，对于革命作家来说，就是要求他们表现代表时代的先进力量的新的人物和新的思想，要求他们表现无产阶级和人民群众的英勇斗争。恩格斯很早的时候就尖锐地批评了德国的那些所谓“真正社会主义者”的作品，责备他们一味“歌颂各种各样的‘小人物’”，却“并不歌颂倔强的、叱咤风云的革命的无产者。”（《诗歌和散文中的德国社会主义》，《马克思恩格斯全集》第四卷）可是，马克思主义的经典作家关于现实主义的卓越理论却长期地遭到了修正主义者们如胡风和卢卡契之流的最恶劣的歪曲。恩格斯本来是从共产主义世界观和无产阶级的利益出发提出现实主义问题的，他号召作家要向前看，要创造出时代的先进人物的形象。而修正主义者却从恩格斯的信中得出了在文艺创作中世界观是不重要的这样一个荒谬结论，甚至认为世界观愈反动愈好。他们号召革命作家向后看，向巴尔扎克的世界观看齐。现在是到了必须把这种谬论彻底扫清的时候了。
    二十多年前，苏联共产党和以高尔基为首的苏联文艺界根据苏联文学发展的经验，提出了社会主义现实主义的口号，这个口号得到全世界革命作家的赞同。近年来，修正主义者拚命攻击社会主义现实主义，其目的就是诽谤社会主义文学的伟大成就，攻击社会主义制度，企图把社会主义作家拉到资产阶级的道路上去。他们以“写真实”为借口来反对文学艺术用社会主义精神教育人民的崇高任务。我国秦兆阳就是这样。而一些革命精神衰退或者革命意志不坚定的作家也接受了这种修正主义思潮的影响。他们在社会主义现实生活中专门寻找阴暗的角落和历史的垃圾，看不见社会主义现实的光辉整体和更光辉的共产主义前途。我们主张文艺应当表现革命发展中的现实和对于更美好未来的理想，把革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义结合起来，这就正是对于修正主义者的进攻的一个有力回答。
    我们的时代充满了各种英雄的事迹。我国人民群众从来没有像今天这样充分地表现出昂扬的革命意志和高度的创造精神，在建设祖国、保卫祖国的各个战线上表现这样高度的革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义。我们的文学艺术，应当如何真实地反映人民群众的这种精神面貌，也就是如何反映我们时代的面貌呢？用阴暗的色调，灰色的语言，琐碎的自然主义的手法，难道能够反映我们时代的面貌吗？那是决不可能的。我们需要用豪迈的语言，雄壮的调子，鲜明的色彩，来歌颂和描绘我们的时代。文艺上的革命浪漫主义正是人民生活中的革命浪漫主义的结晶。采用革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的艺术方法，可以帮助我们的作家、艺术家最真实、最深刻地表现出这个英雄的时代和这个时代的英雄。
    当然，生活是充满矛盾的。生活中的新事物，总是在同旧事物的斗争中产生和成长起来。我们的先进人物的特点，正是在于他敢于同一切违反人民利益的反面现象做斗争，能够战胜各种困难和阻碍，而为新的生活开辟道路。我们正视社会主义社会人民内部的矛盾，这就使我们从根本上免于陷入无冲突论的危险。我们的文学艺术决不要回避缺点和困难，忽视消极事物和反面人物，冲淡生活中的矛盾和斗争；这种廉价的乐观主义，只会把生活简单化，把真正的先进人物描写成没有生命的稻草人。这样的作品，既不能唤起人们对美好事物的崇敬，也不能激起人们对丑恶事物的憎恶，更不能引起人们去思考生活中的问题，看过就会叫人马上忘记。我们要满腔热情地歌颂新人物、新思想，也要毫不留情地鞭挞旧事物、旧思想，要深刻地反映新事物同旧事物的尖锐斗争，因为坚强的崇高的英雄性格正是在这样的斗争中形成和表现出来的。
    毛泽东同志《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中说：“作为观念形态的文艺作品，都是一定的社会生活在人类头脑中的反映的产物。革命的文艺，则是人民生活在革命作家头脑中的反映的产物。”这说明艺术的真实来源于生活的真实，艺术的美来源于生活的美。谁不承认这个，谁就不是马克思主义者，不是唯物主义者，而是资产阶级唯心主义者。但是只承认这个，也还不是完全的马克思主义者，完全的唯物主义者。毛泽东同志进一步指出：生活和艺术“虽然两者都是美，但是文艺作品中反映出来的生活却可以而且应该比普通的实际生活更高，更强烈，更有集中性，更典型，更理想，因此就更带普遍性。”又指出：“革命的文艺，应当根据实际生活创造出各种各样的人物来，帮助群众推动历史的前进。”在这里，毛泽东同志非常精辟地阐明了文学艺术的特点。现实生活是文艺的源泉，但文艺又应当比现实更高；文艺通过形象反映生活，创造人物，其目的不是消极地为反映现实而反映现实，而是为了积极地反映和推动现实，变革现实。这才是完全的马克思主义的观点。
    人类艺术从一开始就同时具有现实的和理想的因素。到后来，现实主义和浪漫主义才发展成为两个不同的流派。现实主义者偏重观察，善于描绘客观世界的精确的图画；浪漫主义者偏重想像，善于抒发对理想世界的热烈幻想。两者从不同的角度反映了现实，丰富了文学艺术的历史。
    但是，过去对于现实主义和浪漫主义却存在着一种片面看法。说到文学艺术传统的时候，不少人往往只强调现实主义，似乎现实主义一切都好，浪漫主义一切都坏，而忘记了在整个文学艺术历史的巨流中，不断积累起来、丰富起来的优良的浪漫主义传统。他们把浪漫主义看成是和现实主义不能相容的。实际上，文学史上，有先进的富于理想的现实主义，也有庸俗的鼠目寸光的现实主义；有消极的反动的浪漫主义，也有积极的进步的浪漫主义。这主要决定于作家、艺术家对待人民、对待现实的态度。而历史上许多伟大的杰出的作家、艺术家，虽然由于他们所处的时代不同，他们的个性和风格各异，有的更富于现实主义精神，有的更富于浪漫主义精神，有的以精雕细琢的写实手法见长，有的以奔放的热情和大胆的幻想取胜，但他们总是常常在他们的作品中表现出现实主义和浪漫主义这两种精神、两种艺术方法的不同程度的结合。他们在揭示现实的种种不合理现象的时候，总是把他们的社会理想，强烈的爱憎和明确的褒贬体现在作品中所描写的人物的性格和关系上；同时他们的昂扬热情和崇高理想又总是由于现实的不合理的现象所激发，植根于生活的土壤的。屈原的《离骚》表露了诗人眷念祖国和热爱人民的胸怀、嫉恶如仇的精神和雄奇壮美的幻想而成为光照千古的杰作。关汉卿的《窦娥冤》和其他一些优秀的元曲作品，真实地描绘了残酷的现实生活，热情地表现了被迫害、被冤屈者的满腔怨愤和正义的最后得到伸张。《水浒传》塑造了一百零八个不同个性的农民革命英雄，作者在这些人物的共功过、同生死的战斗中寄托了“八方共域、异姓一家”的理想。但丁的《神曲》、莎士比亚的不少剧作和歌德的《浮士德》，都表现了幻想和真实的奇妙的结合。高尔基的《海燕》和《鹰之歌》更是鼓舞人民革命斗争的号角。鲁迅的作品，从《呐喊》到《故事新编》，表现了他对现实的清醒态度和批判精神，也表现了一个革命理想主义者的热烈愿望。
    我们今天所提倡的革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义的结合，批判地继承和综合了过去文学艺术中现实主义和浪漫主义的优良传统，在新的历史条件下，在马克思主义世界观的基础上将两者最完满地结合起来，形成为一种完全新的艺术方法。我们正处在社会主义、共产主义胜利的时代，正在从“必然的王国”向“自由的王国”飞跃。解放了的我国人民已开始成为自己命运的主人；他们具有远大的理想，又具有丰富的革命斗争和生产斗争的经验；他们认识和变革现实的能力是无穷无尽的。这就为革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义的结合提供了最肥沃的现实的土壤。
        驳资产阶级人性论
    我在上面叙述了我们的文艺方向、文艺道路和文艺方法，在所有这一系列问题上，我们和修正主义者之间都存在着尖锐的分歧，这归根到底就是两种根本不同的政治路线、两种不同的世界观的分歧。
    文学艺术战线是整个政治战线、思想战线的一个方面；在文艺领域内的修正主义思想不是孤立的现象，而是修正主义的政治观点和哲学观点在文艺上的表现。目前修正主义者正在拼命鼓吹资产阶级人性论、资产阶级虚伪的人道主义、“人类之爱”和资产阶级和平主义等等谬论，来调和阶级对立，否定阶级斗争和革命，散布对帝国主义的幻想，以达到他们保护资本主义旧世界和破坏社会主义新世界的不可告人的目的。
    “人性论”是修正主义者的一个主要思想武器。他们以抽象的共同人性来解释各种历史现象和社会现象，以人性或“人道主义”来作为道德和艺术的标准，反对文艺为无产阶级、劳动人民的解放事业服务。人们可以看到，这些反动思潮对于人民和人民的文艺已经发生了极有害的影响。
    修正主义者特别利用文艺来鼓吹人性论和他们的所谓“人道主义”。南斯拉夫修正主义文艺家声称：“艺术就是人道主义”，艺术应当表现“人类永恒的感情”，描写“一般人性”。当然，这种理论并不是什么新发现。老牌修正主义理论家卢卡契早就认为人道的理想和原则是评价艺术的“绝对标志”，而所谓人道的理想或原则也就是“普遍人性”。胡风是在我国最早贩卖卢卡契这一套理论的，他说“社会主义精神就是人道主义精神”，也就是“仁爱的胸怀”。冯雪峰也说人的根本要求，就是“广大人类的友爱”。正当右派猖狂进攻的时候，巴人又搬出了这一套陈旧的武器来攻击社会主义文艺，说革命的文艺缺乏“人情味”，原因就是没有表现“人和人之间共同相通的东西”，也就是“缺乏人类本性的人道主义”。中外修正主义者原来是一鼻孔出气的。
    我们应当怎样来理解人道主义呢？我们认为在阶级社会中没有什么超时代、超阶级的抽象的人道主义原则。在阶级社会中，作为意识形态的人道主义，总是具有一定的时代的阶级的内容。我们必须区别什么是无产阶级人道主义，什么是资产阶级人道主义。资产阶级人道主义，不管它以什么样的面目出现，归根结底是有利于延长剥削制度；无产阶级人道主义，则是要把人类最后地从一切剥削制度下解放出来。我们是主张无产阶级的人道主义的。同时，对于资产阶级人道主义在历史上曾经产生过的进步作用给以充分的正确的估价。
    人道主义，作为一种社会思潮，是欧洲文艺复兴时期出现的。当时的人道主义者和后来十八世纪的启蒙主义者们，提倡
  “人道”以反对“神道”，提倡“人权”以反对“君权”，提倡“个性解放”以反对中世纪的“宗教桎梏”及其一切残余。这种思潮在历史上确实起过积极的进步的作用。在这种思想的鼓舞下产生了不少灿烂的作品。但是，欧洲资产阶级启蒙运动所要求的，毕竟不过是建立一个“理想化的资产阶级王国”。在这个“王国”里，所谓人权，只是资产阶级的所有权，所谓个性，只是资产阶级个人主义的个性。当时革命的资产阶级思想家把反对封建主义的斗争看作是为了建立符合人的
  “本性”的社会制度的斗争，那不过是他们的一个幻想罢了。到资产阶级掌握政权以后，资产阶级人道主义的口号，和他们所鼓吹的“自由、平等、博爱”等口号一样，就完全丧失了最初的反封建的光芒，而变成用来掩盖资本主义剥削以欺骗工人阶级和麻痹劳动人民的谎言了。
    十九世纪一部分积极浪漫主义作家和批判现实主义作家，对于资本主义的阴暗面曾经提出动人的控诉。他们中间的许多人也以人道主义相号召。但是由于他们没有能够摆脱资产阶级和小资产阶级的眼界的束缚，他们要求的人道主义离不开私有财产和个人主义的圈子，他们的作品往往以同资产阶级秩序相妥协或者以悲观的宿命论告终。
    南斯拉夫铁托集团在他们的纲领中，竭力宣扬“人与人之间的人道主义关系”，宣扬“人与人之间人性的同情和友爱”，提倡以所谓“人道主义精神”教育人民，以“人道主义态度”衡量一切事物。他们把社会主义说成就是人道主义。让我们看一看，他们的所谓“人道主义”到底是什么东西吧。他们的纲领中这样写道：“社会主义不能使人的个人幸福服从任何最高目的，因为社会主义的基本目的，就是个人幸福。”他们把个人的幸福和利益同人类共同幸福的崇高理想对立起来，而把个人利益置于一切之上。很显然，他们的所谓“人道主义”，实质上就是资产阶级个人主义。一位南斯拉夫的作家在一篇吹捧这个纲领的文章中，十分欣赏王尔德所说的“社会主义是一条导致真正个人主义的道路”这句话，就不打自招地供认了他们的所谓“人道主义”究竟是怎么一回事了。
    这位南斯拉夫的作家夸耀他们是“人类大家庭的成员”，这个大家庭“既在东方，又在西方”；英国一小撮共产主义的叛徒揭起所谓“社会主义人道主义”的旗帜，鼓吹什么人类的“不可分性”。现代修正主义者胡说什么世界分为社会主义和帝国主义两个阵营是“一切不幸的根源”。这就可见他们鼓吹“人道主义”的目的何在了。很明显，目的在于否定两个阵营的对立，否定无产阶级对资产阶级的斗争，否定一切革命。
      资产阶级人道主义的思想基础是人性论，而人性论的核心是所谓“人类之爱”，资产阶级文人和修正主义者就把这种
  “爱”看做“普遍人性”，看做文学艺术的永恒主题。
    我们知道，早在一百多年前，马克思、恩格斯怎样无情地嘲笑了克里盖之流的资产阶级思想家把共产主义变成关于爱的呓语，后来恩格斯又怎样尖锐地批评了费尔巴哈关于人类之爱的说教，认为费尔巴哈所宣扬的这种抽象的“爱”是调和阶级矛盾的，这使得“他的哲学中的最后一点革命性也都消失不见了，而留下的只是一句老调子：彼此相爱吧！不分性别、不分等级地互相亲嘴吧，——大家一团和气地痛饮吧！”（恩格斯《费尔巴哈与德国古典哲学的终结》）而现在马克思主义者的队伍中，有些人竟把共产主义和资产阶级人道主义混同起来，说什么共产主义是“人道主义的最高体现”，说什么社会主义学说是“最仁爱的”学说，似乎有一种什么不可捉摸的“人道主义”是永恒不变的绝对真理，而共产主义只不过是它最后完成阶段的表现形式而已。这样，他们就抛弃了马克思主义的历史唯物论和阶级斗争的伟大学说，而退回到了资产阶级的反动的历史唯心论和人性论的立场。他们不谈或少谈阶级性和阶级斗争，而大谈
  “人性”、“人类之爱”和“人道主义”。他们放弃了马克思主义的语言，而拚命采用资产阶级的旧概念、旧词藻来迎合和取悦于资产阶级，竭力使共产主义变成资产阶级可以接受的东西，其结果，不但使自己成为资产阶级思想的俘虏，而且扮演了有意无意地帮助资产阶级欺骗和麻醉人民的角色。
      当然，也有一些好心肠的人被这些动听的名词所迷惑，不能辨别真相，随声附和，就不知不觉地把马克思主义抛到九霄云外去了。
    马克思主义者、真正的革命家决不宣传抽象的“人道主义”和什么“人类之爱”。在存在着阶级对立的世界里，在存在着剥削和被剥削、压迫和被压迫的世界里，决不可能有什么超阶级的“人类之爱”。马克思主义者只知道有无产阶级的友爱，劳动人民的友爱，被压迫人民的友爱。正因为他们真正热爱人民，就必然痛恨压迫人民和剥削人民的人。他们不是片面地宣传爱，而是既宣传对人民的爱，又宣传对压迫者、剥削者的恨；他们唤醒人民的觉悟，促使人民团结起来，为推翻不合理的社会制度、建设光明幸福的新生活而斗争。这就是无产阶级人道主义的内容，也就是革命的文艺所应当表现的内容。
    每个具有马克思主义常识的人都知道，在阶级社会中，不可能有什么超阶级的“人性”，有的只是这个阶级的人性或那个阶级的人性，也就是带着阶级性的人性。马克思主义的创始人用“研究现实的人及其历史发展的科学”代替了“对抽象的人的崇拜”。（恩格斯：《费尔巴哈与德国古典哲学的终结》）按照马克思主义的理解，“就其现实性说来，人的本质乃是社会关系的总和”。（马克思：《费尔巴哈论纲》）实际上，在修正主义者的心目中，所谓“人性”就正是资产阶级的人性，也就是资产阶级的阶级性。在他们看来，凡是合乎资产阶级的思想、心理和生活方式的，就是合乎人性的，否则，就是违反人性的。文艺作品如果写了人物的自私自利、内心分裂或双重人格，那就是合乎“人情”的，有“人性”的；如果写的是摆脱了私有观念的、具有共产主义道德品质的人，如果写的是无产阶级的大公无私的人性，那就是“矫情”的，缺少“人情味”的，也就是不合乎“人性”的。他们把资产阶级人性看成了所谓“共同人性”。
    以历史唯心论反对历史唯物论，以阶级调和反对阶级斗争，以人性论反对阶级论，以资产阶级的反动的腐朽的人性反对无产阶级的革命的高尚的人性，这就是修正主义者的“人性论”的实质。
    现代修正主义者用“人性论”的观点来观察一切问题，因而也用这种观点来看待和平和战争的问题，他们不区别正义战争和非正义战争，也不区别是什么阶级、为了什么目的进行的战争，而认为一切战争都是违反“人性”的，不合“人道”的。
    和平和战争的问题是全世界的人们所关心的问题。全世界人民反对帝国主义的战争威胁，渴望和平。一切革命的、进步的文学、电影、艺术在捍卫世界和平，反对帝国主义、殖民主义的斗争中发挥了巨大的力量。我们马克思列宁主义者从来反对帝国主义的侵略战争。当侵略者把战争强加在人民头上的时候，人民就只有打起反侵略的旗帜，用正义战争来制止非正义战争，以自己的血肉之躯来保卫祖国。人民的这种正义的、英勇的、壮烈的行动，永远值得人们的崇敬。我国文学史上有不少谴责侵略战争罪恶的动人诗篇，而对于抵御外来侵略者的民族英雄，则从来给以热烈的赞扬和歌颂。好些伟大的诗人本人就是反抗压迫侵略的英雄。中国人民是爱好和平的，而在反对侵略者、压迫者的时候又是十分勇敢的。我国人民从鸦片战争以来一百多年前仆后继反对帝国主义的斗争历史，就是一首可歌可泣的伟大史诗。法国的《马赛曲》和我国的《义勇军进行曲》，虽然产生于不同的时代，不同的国家和阶级，却同样地激荡人心。苏联作家们所创作的《铁流》、《毁灭》、《夏伯阳》、《钢铁是怎样炼成的》、《青年近卫军》、《真正的人》以及其他许多同类题材的优秀作品，真实地表现了苏维埃人民的不可摧毁的革命意志和他们对祖国、对共产主义事业的无比忠诚。这些作品给了我国和世界人民以极大的鼓舞和教益。
    人民的作家，对于各国人民反抗侵略、反抗压迫的正义的、革命的战争，只能加以歌颂，而决不能采取任何其他的态度。可是近年来，在文艺如何表现战争的问题上，却出现了一些混乱的现象。有些作家竟然对历史上的正义的、反侵略的战争也采取否定的态度，似乎不管什么性质的战争全是罪恶的、肮脏的。他们把这种正义的战争也描绘成一幅“阴森悲惨”的图画。这些作者不厌其详地描写战争的残酷和恐怖，描写所谓“战壕里的真实”，片面地夸张战争中不可避免的牺牲和死亡。作品中的人物好像只是被动地走向战场，被不可抗拒的命运捉弄着，他们在战场上只是被单纯的求生本能所支配。他们迷惘地发出了“生活有什么意义”这样的疑问。作者把主题放在战争的残酷跟个人幸福的不可调和的矛盾上，大肆渲染主人公的绝望心理和悲剧命运。从这些作品的整个气氛，读者感染到一种对于战争的浓厚的感伤主义和悲观主义的情绪。看来，这些作者完全忘记了他们所描写的是人民的正义的战争。在这种战争中，人民表现了坚韧不拔的毅力、宁死不屈的精神和蔑视敌人的英雄气概，正是战争的正义性和人民的高贵品质战胜了恐怖和死亡，压倒了敌人的反动气焰。在这种战争中，人民虽然遭受了惨重的流血牺牲，但是每个有觉悟的人都知道，个人的牺牲是为了祖国的自由，为了换来社会历史的进步和全体人民的幸福。正是这种信念，推动了人民勇敢地奔赴战场，使他们获得了不可战胜的精神力量。这是颠扑不破的历史的真理。把人民的正义的战争写得那么阴郁凄惨，充满绝望的情调，只是对于这种战争的历史真实的严重歪曲。这样的作品只能使人民对自己的力量和祖国的前途丧失信心，只能瓦解人民保卫祖国、保卫和平、反对帝国主义的斗志，而丝毫无助于争取世界持久和平的伟大事业。
    目前修正主义是世界工人运动中的主要危险。文艺上的修正主义也是一个国际性的现象。继续展开对修正主义思想的斗争，仍是我国文艺界当前的一个重要任务。当然，在反对修正主义的斗争中，必须很好地区别哪些是系统的修正主义观点，哪些只是受了修正主义蒙蔽的一时迷误。对于修正主义应该彻底加以揭露；对于个别的错误论点则应该通过批评辨明是非，使那些一时迷误的同志清醒过来，回到正确的立场，共同前进。
        遗产的批判和继承
    如何对待文学艺术遗产，这也是一个我们同修正主义者和资产阶级文人发生了尖锐分歧的问题。
    对于遗产是采取马克思主义的批判态度，从全面的历史的观点来加以估价呢，还是片面地一概肯定或者一概否定呢？是取其精华，去其糟粕呢，还是取其糟粕，去其精华呢？是推陈出新呢，还是抱残守缺呢？这就是主要的争论之点。
    修正主义者，或者抛弃优秀的古典遗产，大肆贩卖现代资产阶级的颓废艺术，或者制造对于资产阶级文艺遗产的迷信。两种手法的目的是一个：就是利用资产阶级文艺来反对无产阶级的革命文艺。
    胡风和卢卡契等人大肆鼓吹十九世纪欧洲资产阶级的文学，他们把那些作品中所宣扬的资产阶级的人道主义思想当做人类的最高理想，把那些作品的艺术成就看作是不可企及的高峰，把批判现实主义说成是超时代、超阶级、完全不受世界观约束的东西。他们用资产阶级文学的尺度来衡量社会主义文学，贬低社会主义文学的成就，指责社会主义作家没有像批判现实主义者那样揭露社会主义社会的“黑暗”，因而丧失了文学的“批判”功能。他们发出这种论调的用意所在，无非为了反对社会主义制度、反对社会主义文学。这些论调已经受到了应有的驳斥。
    但是现在还有一些以“马克思主义者”自许的文艺理论批评家，对于文学艺术遗产，特别是十九世纪欧洲资产阶级的文学艺术，也抱着盲目崇拜的态度。他们分不清资产阶级文艺和无产阶级文艺的界线。他们把这些作品中的资产阶级人道主义精神同今天的社会主义精神混为一谈，把这些作品中的资产阶级革命性同无产阶级的革命性混为一谈，把批判现实主义同社会主义现实主义混为一谈，在理论上制造了一片混乱。他们忘记了旧时代的文艺是旧时代的产物，旧时代的反映，不可能没有历史的局限性；忘记了十九世纪欧洲的文艺基本上是属于资产阶级范畴的文艺，不可能没有阶级的局限性。他们片面地强调社会主义文艺同过去文艺的继承关系，不敢批判传统、突破传统，不敢承认社会主义文艺的质的革新。
    这种对于文学艺术遗产的盲目崇拜，在我国文艺界和知识青年中间产生了恶劣的影响。有些文学艺术工作者拜倒在西方资产阶级艺术偶像面前，挺不起腰杆来。有些青年读者对资产阶级的文艺作品，由于缺乏辨别和批判的能力，无形中受到它们的消极因素的影响，而在思想上陷于迷惑。因此，按照马克思列宁主义的观点来正确解决如何对待文学艺术遗产的问题，就成为十分必要的事情了。
    马克思主义者从来都是主张对待文化遗产采取批判态度的。列宁讲到继承文化遗产的时候，总是同时讲到必须加以批判和改造。毛泽东同志在对待中外文化遗产的问题上，从来是既反对割断历史，一概排斥，又反对生吞活剥地毫无批判地吸收。他主张对于过去的文化必须取其精华而去其糟粕。他曾经指出：“我们决不可拒绝继承和借鉴古人和外国人，那怕是封建阶级和资产阶级的东西。但是继承和借鉴决不可以变成替代自己的创造，这是决不能替代的。文学艺术中对于古人和外国人的毫无批判的硬搬和模仿，乃是最没有出息的最害人的文学教条主义和艺术教条主义。”毛泽东同志用“推陈出新”这个成语表述了新文艺和旧文艺、新传统和旧传统之间的革命发展的过程。
    我们根据推陈出新的原则，在继承和革新本国文学艺术遗产方面进行了大量的工作，取得了丰富的成果。关于这方面的情况我在前面已经说过了。现在我要说的是如何对待欧洲文艺遗产的问题。外国的优秀文艺遗产，同我国优秀文艺遗产一样，都是人类文化宝藏的重要部分，是我们必须继承和借鉴的。但是，无论对本国的和外国的遗产，我们都只能批判地吸收。
    各个时代的文学艺术是各个时代的社会历史的产物。在阶级没有消灭以前，任何时代、任何国家都有代表反动、代表压迫阶级的文艺和代表进步、代表被压迫阶级的文艺的对立。十八、十九世纪西方资产阶级文艺，有一部分是代表反动的，可以作为反面教材来研究。我们需要批判地继承和发展的是进步文艺的传统。十八、十九世纪欧洲和俄罗斯的文艺对人类作了巨大的贡献，产生了像歌德、巴尔扎克、托尔斯泰这样一批伟大作家。批判现实主义和积极浪漫主义的优秀作品，揭露了封建主义和资本主义的罪恶，在不同程度上表达了当时人民的情绪和愿望，从这些作品中，我们可以认识过去的社会，吸取过去时代人民斗争的经验和智慧，继承他们的奋斗精神和优良品德，同时这些作品描绘生活的艺术技巧也有不少地方值得我们借鉴。但是，就是对于这些作品，我们也必须采取分析和批判的态度，必须看到它们的消极方面。十九世纪欧洲进步的文艺作品，虽然批判了资本主义社会，但它们绝大多数是用资产阶级民主主义、资产阶级人道主义和改良主义的观点进行批判的。虽然他们的世界观中有进步的一面，有朴素的唯物论和进化论，但是他们的阶级局限性究竟限制了他们，使他们不能彻底揭露社会矛盾的根源，更不能指明解决矛盾的出路。这些作品中所描写的人物，很多是个人主义的“英雄”，他们或者像《红与黑》中的于连，由于个人的野心得不到发展而对社会进行报复性的绝望的反抗；或者像约翰·克利斯朵夫，信仰个人的人格力量，以自己的孤独为最大的骄傲。如果青年读者把这些人物当作榜样，不但不可能培养新的集体主义的个性，相反地，只会破坏这种个性，只会巩固旧的个人主义思想。
    到了十九世纪后半期，无产阶级作为资本主义社会的掘墓人、带着最先进的思想武器登上政治舞台以后，相形之下，那种资产阶级民主主义、资产阶级人道主义的批判武器就显得十分陈旧而过时了。在今天的社会主义社会里，如果有人像修正主义者们所提倡的那样，还想拾起资产阶级人道主义和个人主义的旧戈矛，用来“批判”新社会，暴露无产阶级和人民的“黑暗”，那就完全是反人民、反社会主义的行为了。
    资产阶级反动文人和修正主义者对待文学艺术遗产总是取其糟粕，去其精华，而且特别鼓吹其糟粕，用以毒害青年；我们则总是取其精华，去其糟粕。修正主义者总是引导人们向后看，而我们则总是引导人们向前看。我们按照马克思主义的革命世界观和历史唯物主义，对文学艺术遗产进行科学的分析，既要指出过去的优秀作品在当时历史条件下的意义和作用，给以一定的历史地位，这是一方面；另一方面又要指出它们在今天条件下对于人民的意义和作用，这是我们更需要注意而不可忽视的方面。只有同时注意这两个方面，才能避免片面性，才是完整的革命的和历史的观点。总之，对本国和外国的过去的作品都必须加以区别和分析，指出哪一些作品由于深刻地描写了当时的社会生活，以动人的艺术力量反映了历史的真实，在今天和今后仍有重要的价值而且仍然为读者所欣赏；哪一些作品对于当时的社会现实并没有深刻的认识甚至有显著的歪曲，而在艺术上又是一无足取的。对作品中的那些曾经起过进步作用的思想也要加以分析，指出哪一些在今天仍有积极意义，哪一些已不适用于今天，哪一些在新的历史条件下已变成反动的东西。对前人技巧的学习，也要有所选择，不能机械地亦步亦趋。这就是我们所主张采取的马克思主义的历史观点和批判态度。
    在我国文艺界和高等文艺院系中，目前正在对欧洲十八、十九世纪的文艺进行重点研究和批判。继承遗产必须经过研究和批判，要批判就必须研究，而批判又正是为了更好地继承。批判的过程就是一个学习马克思主义、学习遗产的过程。学习，批判；再学习，再批判；只有经过这种反复的过程才能对于批判地继承遗产做到恰如其分。随着社会主义文化建设的经验的积累，人民的共产主义思想水平的提高，这种批判将会一次比一次更细致、更深入，而在突破旧传统的过程中，新传统就将逐步确立起来。又批判，又学习；批判的时候要注意学习，学习的时候要注意批判。批判的时候，必须破除迷信，解放思想，但是容易流于否定一切的粗暴态度，因此要防止粗暴。学习的时候，容易无批判地模仿和硬搬，因此必须强调批判，强调革新，反对保守，反对对古人和外国人的盲目崇拜。我们应当向中外一切优秀的文艺遗产学习，但是决不能让过去的文艺束缚我们的手脚、妨碍我们的创造性。
    新的时代要求新的文学艺术。我们要画最新最美的画，写最新最美的诗，这是时代对我们的要求。因此，我们必须有自己的新的思想，新的技巧，新的艺术方法，新的创作道路。我们要学习前人，但不要妄自菲薄。历史总是不断前进的，后人应当有充分的信心超过前人。由于我们有新的社会环境、新的生活和新的思想，由于人民群众的才能得到比前人更好的发展条件，通过持久不懈、严肃认真的努力，我们中间一定会涌现出一批又一批新的天才，他们将在不同的方面超过前人所达到的艺术成就。
                        ＊　＊　＊
    建国以来，我们的文学艺术工作的成绩是巨大的。充分地肯定成绩，决不是说一切都做得很好了。跟时代和人民的要求相比，我们已经取得的成就，还是很不够的。我们没有丝毫理由可以自满。我们的社会主义文学艺术正处在迅速地全面地成长和成熟的过程中，它充满了强壮旺盛的生命力，同时也还有成长过程中难以避免的缺点。我国人民革命和建设的丰富经验，有许多方面还没有在艺术上得到充分的反映和概括；不少作品的思想、艺术水平，还跟不上群众日益提高的鉴赏力；有些作品还不能免于公式化、概念化的毛病；现代修正主义思潮和各种资产阶级思想，在知识界、文艺界还有市场；文学艺术遗产还有待于进一步整理；当代文学艺术的经验还有待于进一步总结；文艺理论和文艺批评的活动，还需要大大地加强。党和人民有权利要求文艺工作者为新的时代作出更大更辉煌的贡献。
    同志们！我们的目标是创造伟大的社会主义、共产主义文学艺术；我们的任务是艰巨的。
    我们一定要为更好地贯彻执行党和毛泽东同志所规定的文艺路线而作更大的努力，在文艺工作中坚持政治挂帅的原则，进一步加强党的领导，这是使文学艺术事业能够不断取得胜利的根本保证。我们必须和一切敌视党的文艺路线的倾向继续进行斗争，和修正主义及各种反动的资产阶级文艺思想继续进行斗争。取消或放松这种斗争，对资产阶级思想采取迎合和调和的态度，是决不容许的。
    我们的道路是正确的。现在摆在全体文艺工作者面前最中心、最根本的任务，就是要生产出更多、更好的作品。好的作品就是力量。作家、艺术家们！让我们把自己手中的武器锻炼得更加锋利，运用得更加准确和熟练，以自己全部的心血和才华创造具有高度思想性和艺术性的作品，以鼓舞人民群众的革命热情和劳动热情，提高人民的社会主义觉悟，培养具有共产主义道德品质的新人。我们必须努力提高自己的思想修养和文艺修养，一方面认真学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作，继续深入工农群众，参加劳动，不断地改造和提高自己的思想；同时，另一方面要加强艺术实践，不断地提高艺术技巧。作家们应当特别重视掌握语言的艺术。艺术技巧是依据作家艺术家的世界观、修养和对生活的深刻观察、对现实进行艺术加工的一种高度熟练的细致的劳动；轻视技巧，就是轻视人类的劳动和智慧，是完全错误的。只有通过高度的技巧，才能把正确的政治思想和优美的艺术形式最完美地结合起来，才能产生艺术的感染力量。我们必须积极发展工农群众业余的艺术活动，鼓励群众创作，使专门的文艺家和广大群众的业余艺术活动密切结合起来。这样，我们的文艺才有最广泛的群众的基础，而在这个基础上培养出文学艺术各部门的杰出的人才。专业文艺工作者们应该经常向自己提出更高的要求，十倍百倍地提高作品的思想水平和艺术水平，为创造打动千百万人民心灵的文艺作品而尽自己最大的力量。我们的文艺，既要培养人们的共产主义道德品质，又要丰富人们的精神生活，使人增长智慧，提高审美能力。我们的文艺应当使人变得更崇高、更聪明和更优美。审美教育是共产主义教育的一个重要方面。
    要提高文艺创作的水平，同时又要提高文艺理论和文艺批评的水平。为了更有力地促进创作的健康发展和作品水平的提高，帮助人民增强艺术的鉴别力和欣赏力，我们十分需要正确而有力的文艺批评。我们的文艺批评，是站在马克思主义的立场，以政治标准为第一的，同时又必须对作品进行准确的艺术分析，在总结现代创作经验的基础上，树立新时代的科学的艺术标准。我们的文艺批评要同一切敌对的和错误的思想倾向进行严肃的斗争，同时又要大胆地热情地扶植具有生命力的新作品，鼓励艺术上的独创性和各种不同的艺术风格。我们反对文艺批评中的粗暴倾向，同时也要克服不重视作品的整个倾向，而对其中的个别情节过分挑剔的烦琐倾向或盲目捧场的庸俗作风。我们必须继续整理和研究一切优秀的文学艺术遗产，包括理论遗产。在我国历史上出了不少卓越的文艺理论批评家；他们总结了某一方面丰富的创作经验，发表了许多对艺术创作的精辟见解。我们应当批判地继承这份遗产，把它们作为建设我国的马克思主义文艺理论所必须研究和批判运用的资料。我们应当发展群众的评论，使专家的评论和群众的评论结合起来，专业批评工作者要善于集中群众的意见而加以综合和提高，使自己真正成为人民的文艺批评家。我们要重视培养文艺理论批评的新生力量，为建立一支坚强的马克思主义的文艺理论队伍而努力。
    我们的文艺队伍是团结的。我们应当更好地团结一切愿意走社会主义道路的作家、艺术家共同奋斗。文艺界各个协会和一切文艺团体应当成为这种团结的强大核心。我们应当同苏联和其他兄弟国家的社会主义文艺家亲密地团结起来，高度发扬无产阶级国际主义精神，学习他们的先进经验。我们还应当同全世界一切进步的、革命的文艺家，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的文艺家，紧密地团结起来，结成广泛的反对帝国主义及其在各国的反动同盟军的革命的文艺统一战线，为反对帝国主义，争取世界持久和平的共同事业而努力。
    我的报告就要在此结束了。展望前景，我们对于社会主义文学艺术事业充满无限信心。毛泽东同志在开国之初就向我们昭示：中国将以一个具有高度文化的国家而出现于世界。我国人民有总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的照耀，有长期积累的革命斗争的丰富经验和灿烂的文化传统，有把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的指导，我们创造高度文化的条件是充分具备的。我们已经坚定地走上了一条发展社会主义文学艺术的正确道路。我们已经有了一支以工人阶级的作家艺术家为骨干的强大的革命文艺队伍。我们有敬爱的郭沫若同志、茅盾同志和其它许多卓越的、前辈的革命作家、艺术家，又有从群众中不断涌现的大批有才能、有希望的年青文艺工作者。我们的队伍是强大的。只要我们团结一致，永远忠诚于党和人民的事业，永远保持革命的朝气，永远同工农群众共呼吸，不断学习，不断提高自己，就一定能够完成历史所赋与我们的使命，创造出无愧于时代的作品。
    同志们！我们生活在社会主义、共产主义胜利的时代，我们生长在具有悠久文化传统的国家。产生过屈原、司马迁、杜甫、关汉卿、曹雪芹和鲁迅的民族，是一定会继续产生千万个光辉灿烂的文学艺术天才的。如果说我们的祖先由于他们的天才和奋斗创造了各个时代文学艺术的高峰，那末，今天在党和毛泽东同志的领导之下，只要我们把个人的智慧和群众的集体智慧结合起来，只要我们肯付出艰苦的劳动，坚持不懈地奋斗，就一定能够创造出比过去任何时代的文艺更为伟大的、新的文学艺术的高峰。让我们紧密地团结起来，为实现我们的伟大目标而奋斗吧！
