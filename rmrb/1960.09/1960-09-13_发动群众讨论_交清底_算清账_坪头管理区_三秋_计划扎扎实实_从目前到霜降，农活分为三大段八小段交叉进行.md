    Mobilize the Masses for Discussion, Clarify the Foundation, and Calculate Accounts
    Pingtou Management Area's "Three Autumns" Plan is Implemented Solidly
    From Now Until Frost's Descent, Farm Work is Divided into Three Major Stages and Eight Minor Stages, Intertwined and Proceeding Simultaneously

    (Reported by the Shanxi Daily) The Party branch of the Pingtou Management Area of the Pingtou Commune in Lishi County, Shanxi Province, boldly mobilized the masses to discuss and arrange autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and autumn plowing work early.
    In order to strengthen the late-stage management of autumn fields and prepare for autumn harvesting and planting, the Party branch of the Pingtou Management Area launched a widespread and in-depth mass discussion on autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting work from August 27th to 29th. Before the discussion, the Party branch conveyed the Party Central Committee's instructions on the whole Party and the entire people engaging in agriculture and grain production on a large scale, and studied the People's Daily editorial "The Whole Party Acts, The Entire People Acts, Engaging in Agriculture and Grain Production on a Large Scale." Next, they calculated production accounts, living accounts, and autumn livelihood accounts, time accounts, and labor accounts, explaining the current production situation, family resources, and the two-month production tasks of the entire area to the commune members in detail, thoroughly, and repeatedly. They explained the importance of late-stage autumn field management, autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting work this year. Subsequently, with the production team as the unit, the commune members were organized to summarize the experience of making great efforts in deep plowing, accumulating manure on a large scale, and planting wheat well in 1958, as well as the experience of reaping and threshing carefully, ensuring that every grain was stored in the barn, and winning a comprehensive bumper harvest in the summer and autumn of 1958. On the other hand, they deeply and extensively discussed the late-stage management of autumn fields, autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting work this year. If there were different opinions during the discussion, debates were organized, and the unity of thought and understanding was achieved through the debates. At the beginning of the discussion, some people said, "It's time to hang up the hoe after the Beginning of Autumn; the millet has been hoed twice, sorghum, corn, and beans have been hoed three times, and cotton has been hoed four times. There's nothing more to do even if we keep working." Someone said, "Hoeing once more around the White Dew period will increase production by at least five catties of grain per mu; there is still much to be done in autumn field cultivation." After debate, it was unanimously agreed that the latter opinion was correct. It was democratically decided that millet should be hoed three times, beans four times, cotton five times, and foxtail millet, naked oats, and autumn vegetables, which are still growing, should be given more fertilizer and weeds should be removed. Although sorghum does not need to be hoeed again, the plants should be straightened once more, and those pushed down by the water should be supported, striving to increase production by six or seven catties of grain per mu. Before the debate, some people said, "There is no need to prepare for the autumn harvest; just follow the seasons and harvest when the time comes." After discussion, everyone felt that this opinion was wrong, and autumn harvest preparation work must be carried out on a large scale. The commune members said: Doing a good job in preparation ensures that harvesting is done as soon as crops are ripe, that reaping and threshing are done carefully, and that increasing yield by ten or so catties per mu is easy; a slight oversight can result in the loss of ten or so catties per mu. Therefore, it was decided to immediately check all the tools needed for autumn harvesting and autumn planting, repair damaged ones immediately, and replenish any shortages, ensuring that all needed tools are available and in good condition, so that tools are waiting for people, not the other way around. Before the discussion, a few commune members did not advocate expanding the wheat planting area. They said: There are more return crops this year, and there is not enough time; if too much is planted, the quality cannot be guaranteed, so it is better to plant less. After discussion, everyone agreed that wheat is an insurance crop, and increasing one crop to two crops can increase grain production. As for the time issue, it is also a matter of human effort. As long as the preparation work is done well and everyone starts working, planting a few dozen more mu of wheat is nothing. Therefore, it was decided to expand the wheat planting area by about 10%, and the land should be deep plowed again with a set plow. Each mu of ordinary land should be applied with at least fifteen dan of pure human and animal manure, ten dan of green manure and smoked manure, and three catties of chemical fertilizer, etc. Fertilizer should be increased by 40% for high-yield fields compared to ordinary fields to ensure high standards of sowing quality.
    Through democratic discussion, this management area fully and thoroughly exposed the contradictions in production and the problems existing in autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting, and formulated a solid autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting plan, so that the plan was based on a reliable foundation. During the discussion, cadres and commune members, with the team as the unit, calculated livelihood accounts plot by plot, calculated time accounts day by day according to the seasons, and calculated labor accounts person by person according to the number of people who could work in the fields. In two nights, appropriate arrangements were made for late-stage autumn field cultivation, autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting. According to their plan, from August 29 to the Frost's Descent on October 23, autumn production work will be divided into three major stages and eight minor stages to be carried out in an intertwined manner, ensuring the comprehensive completion of various autumn production tasks.

    发动群众讨论  交清底  算清账
    坪头管理区“三秋”计划扎扎实实
    从目前到霜降，农活分为三大段八小段交叉进行
    本报讯　据山西日报报道：山西离石县坪头公社坪头管理区党支部，放手发动群众，及早讨论、安排秋收、秋种、秋耕工作。
    坪头管理区党支部，为了加强秋田后期管理，做好秋收、秋种准备工作，于8月27日至29日，发动全体社员，对秋收、秋耕、秋种工作展开了广泛深入的全民大讨论。讨论前，党支部传达了党中央关于全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的指示，学习了人民日报“全党动手、全民动手、大办农业、大办粮食”的社论。接着，算了生产账、生活账和秋季的营生账、时间账、劳力账，向社员群众详细地、透彻地、反复地交代了当前生产情况、生活家底，指出了全区两个月的生产任务，讲明了今年秋田后期管理、秋收、秋耕、秋种工作的重要意义。随后，以生产队为单位，组织社员一方面总结1958年大闹深翻、大搞积肥、种好小麦和1958年细收细打颗粒归仓夺得夏秋两季全面丰收的经验；另一方面深入广泛地讨论了今年秋田后期管理、秋收、秋耕、秋种工作。讨论中发生了不同意见，就组织辩论，通过辩论达到了思想认识的统一。刚开始讨论时，有人说：“立秋挂锄钩，谷子已锄过两次，高粱、玉米、豆子已锄三次，棉花已锄过四次，再加工也没事可做了。”有人说：“白露前后再锄一次，每亩最少增产五斤粮，秋田加工还大有可为。”经过辩论，一致认为后一种意见正确，民主决定谷锄三次，豆锄四次，棉花锄五次，糜子、莜麦、秋菜正在生长还要大追肥、大锄草。高粱虽不需要再锄，但要再整一次植株，把水推倒的扶起来，力争每亩增产六、七斤粮食。辩论前有人说：“秋收无须准备，按季节办事，到时间收割就对了。”经过讨论，大家认为这种意见不对头，必须大抓秋收准备工作。社员们说：做好准备，保证随熟随收，精收细打，一亩地多收十来斤不费事；稍有疏忽，每亩地丢失十来斤也看不见。于是决定立即检查秋收、秋种所需要的一切工具，坏了的马上修理，缺短的马上补买，保证需要的工具，一件不缺一件不坏，做到让工具等人，人不等工具。讨论前少数社员不主张扩大小麦播种面积，他们说：今年回茬多，时间赶不过来，种的多了就不能保证质量，还不如少种一点好。经过讨论，大家一致认为，麦子是保险田，一茬变两茬就可以增产粮食；至于时间问题，也是事在人为，只要准备工作做得好，大家动起手来，多种几十亩小麦也不算什么。于是决定，将麦田播种面积扩大10％左右，并且要用套犁把土地再深翻一次，一般田每亩至少施纯人粪和畜粪十五担，绿肥、熏肥十担，化肥等三斤，丰产田比一般田增施肥料40％，保证播种质量高标准。
    这个管理区经过民主讨论，全面地、彻底地揭露了生产中的矛盾和秋收、秋耕、秋种中存在的问题，制订了扎扎实实的秋收、秋耕、秋种计划，使计划建立在可靠的基础上。讨论中，以队为单位，干部社员在一起，按地块逐块算营生账，按节令逐日算时间账，按能上地人逐个算劳力账，用了两夜，就将秋田后期加工、秋收、秋耕、秋种等作了适当安排。按照他们的计划，从8月29日到10月23日霜降止，将秋季生产工作分为三大段、八小段交叉进行，保证全面完成秋季各项生产任务。
