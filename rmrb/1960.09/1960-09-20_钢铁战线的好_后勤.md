    Good "Logistics" on the Steel Front
    To Shorten Repair Time
    One evening, the Tianjin Hardware, Transportation, and Electrical Equipment Company's Steel Support Shock Brigade received a call from the Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant: A repair task required more than ten kinds of electrical equipment.  Salesman Zhao Bingyi immediately and confidently replied on the phone: "To shorten the steel plant's repair time, we'll move heaven and earth to find the equipment quickly!"

    The shock brigade immediately dispatched people, and in just over twenty minutes they gathered nine kinds of electrical materials, such as slate switches and rubber cables. Without even taking time to eat, Zhao Bingyi and Xu Rongqing took turns riding a tricycle to the Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant to deliver the equipment to the steel "commander's tent."  Around ten o'clock that evening, shock brigade members Li Baozhong and others used bicycles to deliver the ten-way iron-shell switches, which were not easy to find, to the steel plant.

    At midnight, Zhao Bingyi went to the warehouse again to retrieve two compensation starters. It was difficult for the warehouse keepers to get goods at night. However, when warehouse keeper Sun Shixiao heard that this was equipment needed by the steel plant, he immediately worked with warehouse workers Liu Weitian and Zhang Wanlu to move the two compensators from the pile of goods and helped load them onto the vehicle. When the compensators were delivered to the Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant, the secretary of the steel plant's Party committee tightly grasped Zhao Bingyi's hand and excitedly said: "With the support of the whole Party and the whole people, and with such outstanding logistics troops like you, we must shorten repair time and ensure the fulfillment and overfulfillment of our production plan!" In fact, the repair work at the Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant went particularly smoothly this time.
    Immediately Thought of Zhang Shizhen

    One day, a worker at the Tianjin No. 4 Rolling Steel Plant suddenly discovered a "strange thing": "How did my bicycle change? When I rode it in the morning, the bell didn't ring and the frame had problems; now the bell rings and the frame is sturdy. What's going on?" When he shouted, some other workers also discovered that their bikes had changed: the brakes that didn't work now worked, the lights that didn't shine now shone, and the tires that leaked air no longer leaked... No one asked who had done this good deed. They immediately thought of Zhang Shizhen.

    Indeed, this was done by the famous and outstanding salesperson Zhang Shizhen. The day before, she saw some workers pushing their bikes to repair shops far away after getting off work, and she thought with concern: Steelworkers work hard all day, and they still have to go repair their bikes. How can we save them this time and let them rest more?  So she went to the Guangfu Road Repair Service Station to discuss helping the steelworkers repair their bikes at the factory. The workers at the repair station agreed to her proposal and immediately came to the factory with her to repair all the faulty bikes.

    Zhang Shizhen has been living at the rolling steel plant for more than a month. She thinks of the steelworkers everywhere and has done many good things for them.

    She led the Guangfu Road Store's resident team to the factory, surveyed the workers' income and consumption levels, and planned a method for supplying appropriate and timely goods that was both economical and met their needs. She labored and ate with the rolling steelworkers, and deeply solicited their requirements for improving meals. When she learned that the workers liked to eat cool and fresh vegetarian food, she and the cooks arranged twenty or thirty kinds of cool vegetarian dishes such as pickled lotus root slices and sauteed melon strips. Many workers reflected: It's hot and the furnace temperature is high, we want to eat things like this. She also helped the cafeteria implement a shift-based dining system in all three cafeterias in the factory, allowing workers to sit down and eat as soon as they entered the cafeteria, saving time for buying meals... These things all inspired the rolling steelworkers' production enthusiasm, and everyone worked even harder.
    Haircuts at the Factory

    September 7th was the rest day for Tianjin's Special-Class Labor Model, hairdresser Ju Shiying. On this day, she carried a small package and walked more than ten miles, but not for an outing, nor to visit relatives or friends, but to give haircuts to the workers at the Tianjin Iron and Steel Plant.

    A few days ago, Ju Shiying followed the crowd to offer condolences to the workers at the iron and steel plant. She was very moved by the workers' enthusiasm for increasing steel production. She thought to herself: I'll take advantage of a rest day to go to the factory and give them haircuts. Although I'll have less rest, it can save the iron and steel workers a trip and save them time to rest better. This is also a small way for me to support steel production!

    "Aunt Ju is here, Aunt Ju is here."  That day, as soon as she entered the factory gate, the iron and steel workers greeted her warmly. Ju Shiying quickly started giving haircuts to the young men. Before giving each person a haircut, she carefully asked them what hairstyle they wanted and how long they wanted to keep it, and recommended the "Steel Hero" hairstyle that was easy to comb, wash, and beautiful. When giving haircuts, the workers often sat casually on ordinary chairs. Ju Shiying would give them haircuts in whatever position was comfortable for the workers, not caring if her own posture was awkward. When the sunlight shone into the room, she would let the workers move to a shady place, preferring to be in the sun herself.

    While giving haircuts, she also asked if there were other people who needed haircuts. Hearing that some of the workers operating by the coking furnace also needed haircuts, she carried her small package to the furnace and gave them haircuts during the brief breaks in cross-operations. That day, she gave haircuts to more than twenty workers in a row.

    A few days later, the iron and steel plant achieved a great victory in production, and the workers immediately thought of Aunt Ju's kindness in supporting steel production. They took time out of their spare time to beat drums and gongs and rush to her Qingshun Hair Salon to report the good news. The good news was written in large characters: "Service Expert, Steel Support Vanguard."
    Letting Competition Opponents "Know Themselves and Their Enemies"

    The finance and trade cadres of Hedong District, Tianjin, went deep into the steel plant to help workshops and teams further improve the economic accounting system, and promote the steelworkers' competition and evaluation.

    As soon as the new upsurge in steel production in Tianjin began, the leading cadres of the finance and trade departments of Hedong District organized more than two hundred employees to go deep into the front line of production at the Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant, each finding a base, understanding the key to production, and studying ways for the finance and trade departments to support steel production. After going deep, they found that the economic accounting system of some teams was not sound enough, and the workers did not know enough about the completion of their own production plans and those of their competitors in a timely manner. In order to let the competition opponents better "know themselves and their enemies," they immediately helped each team improve the team accounting system, and announced the completion of the production plan on time and by shift. This made it easier for the workers to chase each other and strive to be upstream, promoting the competition of high production, high quality, and low consumption.

    The finance and trade cadres of Hedong District also went to Handan, Xuanhua and other pig iron producing areas to assist local iron and steel plants in establishing and improving systems such as furnace-by-furnace testing, graded storage, and graded transportation, so that the steel plants could obtain raw materials of better quality.

### 钢铁战线的好“后勤”

    钢铁战线的好“后勤”	    为了缩短检修时间
    一天傍晚，天津市五金交通电工器材公司援钢突击队接到天津第一钢厂的电话：有一项检修任务，需要十几种电工器材。业务员赵秉义当场就在电话中肯定地回答：“为了缩短钢厂检修时间，就是上天入地，也要迅速把器材找到！”
    突击队立刻撒出人马，二十多分钟就凑集了石板闸、胶皮线等九种电工器料。赵秉义没顾得吃饭，便和许荣庆等轮换蹬着三轮车，赶赴天钢一厂，把器材送到钢帅帐前。晚上十点左右，突击队队员李宝忠等五人又把不容易找到的十合铁壳开关，用自行车送到钢厂。
    午夜十二点，赵秉义又到仓库去取两台补偿发动器。深夜取货，保管员是有一定困难的。但是，仓库保管员孙世校一听说这是钢厂需要的器材，便立即和库工刘维田、张万禄，从货垛上把两台补偿器搬下来，并且帮助装好车。当补偿器运到天钢一厂的时候，钢厂党委书记紧紧握着赵秉义的手，兴奋地说：“有全党全民的支援，有你们这样出色的后勤部队，我们一定要缩短检修时间，保证完成和超额完成生产计划！”事实上，天钢一厂这次检修工作也进行得特别顺利。	一下就想到张士珍
    天津第四轧钢厂的一个工人有一天忽然发现了一件“怪事”：“怎么我的自行车变了样？早晨骑来时，铃铛不响，车身有毛病；现在铃铛响了，车身也牢壮了。这是怎么搞的？”他一喊，别的一些工人也发现自己的车子变了样：刹车不灵的灵了，车灯不亮的亮了，车胎跑气的不跑了……大伙都没有问这是谁干的好事。他们一想就想到了张士珍。
    的确，这是著名优秀售货员张士珍办的事。前一天，她看到有的工人下班以后，推着车子往很远的车铺去，就关切地想：钢铁工人辛苦了一天，还要去修车。怎么样把这段时间省下来，让他们多休息休息？于是，她就到光复道修配服务站商量，下厂帮助钢铁工人修车。修配站工人都同意她的倡议，马上就跟她到厂里来把有毛病的车都修了。
    张士珍住到轧钢厂已经一个多月了。她处处为钢铁工人着想，为钢铁工人办了不少好事。
    她带着光复道商店驻厂小组，调查了工人的收入和消费水平，规划了既节约又合乎需要的适时适量的商品供应办法。她和轧钢工人一起劳动，一起吃饭，深入地征求了他们对改进伙食的要求。当她了解到工人喜欢吃清凉新鲜的素食时，就和炊事员一起安排了炝藕片、溜瓜条等二、三十种清凉素菜。许多工人反映说：天热炉温高，我们正想吃这样的东西。她还帮助食堂在全厂三个食堂实行了分班就餐的办法，让工人进食堂就能坐下吃饭，节省了买饭的时间……。这些事都鼓舞了轧钢工人的生产热情，大伙干得更加起劲。	进厂理发
    9月7日，是天津市特等劳动模范、理发员居士英的休息天。这天，她提着个小包裹，步行了十几里地，但一不是作郊游，二不是探亲访友，而是去给天津炼铁厂的工人理发。
    前几天，居士英随大伙去慰问炼铁厂工人。她看着工人们增产钢铁的劲头十分感动。心里就想：趁哪个休息天，到厂里给他们理理发。自己虽然少休息一点，但是可以让炼铁工人少走点路，节省下时间更好地休息。这也是自己支援钢铁生产的一点心意！
    “居大姐来了，居大姐来了。”那天她刚进厂门，炼铁工人们就纷纷亲切地同她打招呼。居士英很快就给小伙子们理起发来。在每个人理发以前，她都细心地问他们要什么发型、要留多长，并且向他们推荐梳、洗方便而美观的“钢铁英雄式”发型。理发时，工人坐在普通椅子上，姿势往往比较随便。居士英随工人怎么坐得舒服就怎么给理，自己姿势别扭一点也不在乎。太阳光照进屋里，她就让工人挪到荫凉地方，宁可自己挨点晒。
    一面理发，一面打听还有哪些人没有理。听说正在炼焦炉旁操作的工人，有的也需要理发，她就提着小包赶到炉旁，利用交叉作业短暂的休息时间为他们理发。这一天，她接连地给二十多个工人理了发。
    几天后，炼铁厂生产大捷，工人们立即想起了居大姐支援钢铁生产的一片好心。他们就在业余时间敲锣打鼓地赶往她所在的庆顺理发店来报捷。喜报上写着几个大字：“服务能手，援钢尖兵。”	让竞赛对手“知己知彼”
    天津市河东区的财贸干部深入钢厂，帮助车间和小组进一步健全了经济核算制，促进了钢铁工人的竞赛评比。
    天津市钢铁生产新高潮刚开始，河东区财贸部门的领导干部就组织了二百多名职工深入到天津第一钢厂生产第一线，各找据点，了解生产关键，研究财贸部门支援钢铁生产的办法。深入下去以后，发现有的小组经济核算制还不够健全，工人们对本身和竞赛对象的生产计划完成情况知道得不够及时。为了让竞赛对手们更好地“知己知彼”，他们立即帮助各小组健全了小组核算制度，作到按时、按班公布生产计划完成情况。这就更便于职工们你追我赶，力争上游，推动了高产、优质、低耗的竞赛。
    河东区的财贸干部还分赴邯郸、宣化等生铁产地，协助当地炼铁厂建立和健全了分炉化验、分级存放、分级运输等制度，使钢厂得到了质量更好的原料。
