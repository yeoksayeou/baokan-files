(From our newspaper in Chengdu on the 25th) Sichuan Neijiang County's Shunjiang People's Commune, adhering to the spirit of taking agriculture as the foundation and grain as the key link, highly economizes on land and rationally uses cultivated land. Recently, they mobilized the masses to inspect the use of land for non-agricultural production, and from diversified operations run by the brigades and above, commune-run industries, and basic construction departments, they cleared and compressed over 3,000 mu of cultivated land for prioritized development of grain production.

Shunjiang Commune has little land and a large population. Of the 120,000 mu of cultivated land, about one-third is used for planting cash crops each year. How to carefully plan and use this limited land for the most urgent needs in accordance with the spirit of taking grain as the key link is one of the keys to accelerating the development of production in this commune. Since late August, the commune's Party committee has conducted in-depth investigations and studies on the use of land throughout the commune, and found that the potential for tapping land in many non-agricultural production departments is considerable. Therefore, it was decided that while clearing up the labor force in various departments, a clearing and adjustment of land occupation would also be carried out. The commune's Party committee first adopted the method of careful accounting, using specific and vivid examples to educate cadres and commune members on rational use and conservation of land. The different results achieved by Qianjin Brigade and Shunjiang Brigade in using land provided great inspiration. These two brigades were originally units with better production, and their conditions in all aspects were roughly the same. However, because the former conscientiously took agriculture as the foundation and rationally used land, the diversified operations and commune-run industries run by the brigade and the commune occupied very little land, totaling no more than 1%. Less labor was also transferred, resulting in a greater increase in grain production year after year. Shunjiang Brigade had more than 4,300 mu of land, but diversified operations and commune-run industries run by the brigade and the commune occupied more than 400 mu, and they were all top-quality fertile land. In addition, the use of labor was also more dispersed. As a result, although the agricultural yield per mu has increased in the past two years, the growth rate of the total output has been very slow.

After studying and discussing, the cadres and commune members of the entire commune actively supported the decision made by the commune's Party committee to prioritize all labor, land, and resources for agricultural production, especially grain production. Various non-agricultural production departments extensively mobilized the masses to take the initiative to conduct a comprehensive inspection and adjustment of the cultivated land occupied by their departments, leaving no stone unturned, striving for every inch of land, and making every effort to free up more and better land to ensure the needs of agricultural production. The principle of clearing up adopted by the meeting of commune members' representatives was: the agricultural land use of the entire commune must be maintained at such a level that the total area of grain sown in both the major and minor spring seasons for each person each year is no less than 1.5 mu, and strive to plant more; the area of cash crops will fulfill the planting plan issued by the state. The methods they adopted were: commune, brigade, and various departments such as diversified operations, commune-run industries, basic construction, and cultural and educational undertakings, carried out clearing team by team, field by field, and factory by factory. All land occupied in excess will be returned to the production team for use; land occupied for non-productive construction that is not directly related to agricultural production will be stopped or delayed; diversified operation projects that are closely related to agricultural production but occupy a large amount of land will appropriately reduce the area of land occupied on the basis of improving management and increasing land utilization rate; non-agricultural production land should occupy as little good land as possible or not occupy good land at all, and the good fertile land that has already been occupied should be exchanged if possible. In the process of clearing up the land, various departments are not just passively occupying less land, but are also taking a series of active measures to develop their own production. Therefore, important departments such as forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and commune-run industries in the entire commune have all proposed guarantees: reduce people, reduce land, and do not reduce production. For example, livestock breeders throughout the commune contributed ideas and suggestions, and decided to adopt methods such as increasing the yield per mu of the feed base, making full use of the "five edges" to vigorously develop "mountains full of green", and using intercropping and interplanting of feed between crops to greatly increase production. In this way, the entire commune can free up nearly 1,000 mu of feed land for agricultural production, and the output of green and coarse feed can still increase compared to the past. The ten forest farms in the entire commune have strengthened the management of the nursery, transplanted the tree seedlings that were planted too sparsely in the past, and increased the density of planting. This does not affect the normal growth of the tree seedlings, but it can free up more than 140 mu of cultivated land. The large brick and tile factory run by the commune was originally built on the best land in Taiping Dam. During this adjustment, it was moved to the abandoned land next to Lion Mountain for production. The number of people was reduced by 70 and the land was compressed by 130 mu, but they stepped up the reform of tools and realized semi-mechanization. As a result, the output of bricks and tiles has also increased compared to the past.

Shunjiang Commune's resolute measures of taking agriculture as the foundation, rationally arranging labor, and rationally using land have greatly strengthened the forces on the agricultural production front. After the commune cleared up labor and land, the eighth team of Shunjiang Brigade increased its labor force from 64 to 108 and its land from 410 mu to 620 mu. The captain and commune members said with full confidence: With a strong labor force and more land, we guarantee that production will be better. This year, the actual sown area of late autumn crops in the entire commune has increased by more than 50% compared to last year.

### 以粮为纲全面调整　节约用地寸土必争　顺江公社腾出三千多亩地扩种粮食  合理安排劳力，切实加强农业战线，今年秋播面积比去年扩大50％以上

    以粮为纲全面调整　节约用地寸土必争
　　顺江公社腾出三千多亩地扩种粮食
    合理安排劳力，切实加强农业战线，今年秋播面积比去年扩大50％以上
    本报成都25日电　四川内江县顺江人民公社本着以农业为基础、以粮为纲的精神，高度节约土地，合理使用耕地。最近发动群众检查非农业生产用地情况，从大队以上举办的多种经营、社办工业、基本建设等部门，清理和压缩出三千多亩耕地，用于优先发展粮食生产。
    顺江公社地少人多，十二万亩耕地中，每年用于种植经济作物的占三分之一左右。如何精打细算，把这有限的土地按照以粮为纲的精神用于最急需的方面，是这个公社加快发展生产的关键之一。公社党委8月下旬以来，曾专门对全社土地使用情况进行了深入的调查研究，发现许多非农业生产部门可挖的土地潜力不小。因此，决定在清理各部门劳动力同时，对占用土地的情况也进行一次清理和调整。公社党委首先采取算细账的办法，用具体鲜明对比的事例，向干部和社员进行合理用地和节约用地的教育。前进大队与顺江大队使用土地情况所收到的不同效果，给人们很大启发。这两个大队原来都是生产搞得较好的单位，各方面条件大致相同，但是，由于前者切实做到了以农业为基础合理使用土地，大队和公社主办的多种经营、社办工业等非农业生产占地很少，总计不过1％，劳动力抽调也较少，结果连年粮食增产的幅度都较大。顺江大队共有四千三百多亩土地，但大队和公社举办的多种经营、社办工业等非农业生产即占去四百多亩，而且都是上等的好田好地，加上劳力使用也较分散，结果两年来农业单产虽有提高，总产量增长速度却很缓慢。
    全社干部和社员经过学习和讨论，积极拥护公社党委作出的把一切劳力、土地、资财优先用于农业生产、特别是粮食生产的决定。各个非农业生产部门广泛发动群众主动地对本部门占用的耕地进行全面的检查和调整，滴点不放，寸土必争，尽可能地把更多更好的土地腾出来，保证农业生产的需要。社员代表会议作出的清理原则是：全社农业用地必须保持在这样的水平：每人每年大小春两季粮食播种面积合计最低不少于一亩半，力争种得更多；经济作物面积完成国家下达的种植计划。他们采取的办法是：公社、大队各级和多种经营、社办工业、基本建设、文化教育事业等各部门，逐队、逐场、逐厂地进行清理，凡是多占用的土地，一律退回生产队使用；与农业生产没有直接关系的非生产性建设占地，该停则停、该缓则缓；与农业生产关系密切但占地较多的多种经营项目，在改善经营、提高土地利用率的基础上，适当缩小占地范围；非农业生产用地，尽量少占好地或不占好地，已占用的好田好地，能调换的加以调换。各部门在清理土地中，不是仅仅消极地少占用地，而是同时采取一系列发展本身生产的积极措施，因此全社林、牧、副、社办工业等重要部门都提出保证：减人、减地、不减产。如全社饲养员献计献策，决定采用提高饲料基地单产、充分利用“五边”地大搞“满山青”，并利用农作物行间大量增种、套种饲料等办法，全社由此可腾出近一千亩饲料地用于农业生产，而青粗饲料的产量还能比过去增加。全社十个林场加强苗圃的管理工作，把过去过于稀植的树苗移栽，提高密植程度，这样做并不影响树苗的正常生长，却能抽出一百四十多亩耕地。公社举办的大型砖瓦场，原来建立在太平坝最好的土地上，这次调整时，迁移到狮子山旁的废地生产，人员减少了七十人，土地压缩了一百三十亩，但是他们加紧改革工具，实现了半机械化，结果砖瓦产量还比过去有所增加。
    顺江公社坚决以农业为基础，合理安排劳力和合理使用土地的措施，大大加强了农业生产战线的力量。顺江大队八小队在公社清理劳力和土地后，劳动力由六十四个增加到一百零八个、土地由四百一十亩增加到六百二十亩，队长和社员信心百倍地说：劳力强，土地多，生产保证搞得更好。今年全社晚秋作物实播面积比去年扩大50％以上。
