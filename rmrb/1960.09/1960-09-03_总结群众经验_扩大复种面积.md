Summarize Mass Experience, Expand Replanting Area
Li Wen, First Secretary of the CPC Yantai Prefectural Committee, Shandong

    In the past two years, Yantai Prefecture has undergone significant reforms in its farming system. The multiple cropping index has increased from 137% in 1957 to over 150% this year; intercropping and relay cropping areas have more than doubled. This practice of continuously expanding the planting area and continuously improving land utilization fully embodies the principle of combining multiple planting with high yield, and has greatly promoted agricultural production throughout the region.

    Expanding autumn planting area brings new problems

    However, the reform of the farming system, like the development of any other thing, will inevitably bring many new contradictions that need to be overcome urgently. The more obvious ones are: First, there are contradictions in crop layout. The expansion of planting area in Yantai Prefecture in 1960 was led by wheat and other summer-harvested crops. Because the area of ​​summer-harvested crops has expanded, it will inevitably reduce the area of ​​spring-sown crops. After the area of ​​spring-sown crops is reduced, not only the planting area of ​​major spring-sown crops such as corn, sweet potatoes, sorghum, millet, and peanuts will be directly affected, but also wheat fields and other autumn-sown crops will face practical difficulties in autumn planting because of more stubble land being changed. This difficulty is prominently manifested as the contradiction between ensuring the sowing plan and timely sowing. Second, with the reduction of spring-sown area and the increase of summer harvesting and planting tasks, the contradiction of "relaxed in spring and tight in summer" is particularly prominent in the year-round labor arrangement.

    Contradiction is the driving force of all things. The purpose of our understanding of contradiction is to actively find solutions to the contradiction. Thanks to the joint efforts of leaders and the masses, we have finally found a set of effective measures: that is, to change summer-sown crops into wheat field intercrops. This year, the entire region has approximately 600,000 mu of summer-sown crops using cross-intercropping, including peanuts intercropped in wheat fields, as well as corn and soybeans intercropped in wheat fields. There are three major advantages to engaging in large-scale intercropping:

    There are three major advantages to implementing wheat field intercropping

    First, it is possible to plan to change some of the summer-sown crops to wheat field intercropping, freeing up more land to arrange for high-yield grain crops and cash crops that are sown in the spring. In addition to expanding the summer-harvested crop area by 1.2 million mu, the actual planting area of ​​oil crops in Yantai Prefecture this year has also expanded by 580,000 mu, while the planting area of ​​spring and summer sweet potatoes, which are the main crops determining the yield of the entire region, is still more than 100,000 mu more than last year. This fully proves the significant role of summer-sown crop cross-intercropping in solving the problem of spring-sown crop arrangement.

    After the area of ​​summer-sown crop cross-intercropping expands, a large number of summer-sown crops become "half-summer" crops, and some even become spring-sown crops. As a result, early and mid-autumn crops have increased during the autumn harvest and planting season, while late-autumn crops have decreased; early and mid-stubble wheat field areas have increased, while late-stubble wheat field areas will inevitably decrease. Therefore, the contradiction that exists in completing the sowing plan and timely sowing is readily solved.

    Second, with the large-scale expansion of the sowing area of ​​wheat and other summer-harvested crops, the sowing area of ​​spring-sown crops will inevitably be relatively reduced, and the sowing area of ​​summer-sown crops will inevitably be relatively expanded. With the change of sowing area of ​​spring and summer crops, the labor force required in each quarter will inevitably change. That is, the labor force required in spring will be relatively reduced, and the labor force required in summer will be relatively increased. However, after the summer-sown crops are intercropped, this imbalance between tight summer and relaxed spring can be adjusted. Taking Haiyang as an example, the county's summer harvest area has expanded by 136,000 mu compared to last year, but they intercropped 160,000 mu of corn, soybeans, and peanuts before the wheat harvest. As a result, the summer planting area did not increase compared to the past, but decreased by more than 24,000 mu. This greatly reduced the contradiction of insufficient labor during the summer harvest and planting period, overcame the flood and waterlogging disasters, and successfully completed the summer harvest and planting tasks.

    Third, in the process of crop growth, sunlight and temperature are indispensable and important conditions, especially reflected in the growth of summer-sown crops. As the local farmers say: "Planting one day earlier, harvesting ten days earlier." From the growth of crops, we can also see this situation at any time: All crops that are suitable for both winter sowing and spring sowing—such as wheat, barley, and peas—have higher yields when sown in winter than in spring; all crops that are suitable for both spring sowing and summer sowing have higher yields when sown in spring than in summer. This shows that early sowing allows crops to have a longer growing period, especially fully utilizing the favorable conditions of sunlight and temperature that are more suitable for crop growth during the summer harvest and planting period, which is extremely important. And changing summer sowing to wheat field intercropping precisely embodies this point.

    Wheat field intercropping fully meets the conditions

    In recent years, the development of water conservancy construction and pig raising for fertilizer accumulation has laid a favorable foundation for the improvement of farming technology, and has also created conditions for reforming the farming system. This is the material condition for vigorously promoting cross-intercropping of summer-sown crops. On the other hand, the masses in Yantai Prefecture have the habit of intercropping and relay cropping, especially in the eastern counties, there is a considerable history of cross-intercropping of summer-sown crops. This is the mass base and technical conditions for vigorously promoting cross-intercropping of summer-sown crops. The only difference is that the past summer intercropping was carried out when wheat was sparsely planted, and the sowing period was limited to the wheat yellowing period.

    However, changing summer sowing to wheat field intercropping, like the development of other new things, is always unacceptable to some people who are accustomed to old practices. They always raise a series of questions and lay out a pile of difficulties. For example, the prefectural committee raised this issue in the spring based on the existing experience of the masses, but some areas implemented it better, while some areas did not implement it well enough. In areas where the implementation was not good enough, there were mainly many concerns and erroneous understandings in their thinking. Therefore, if we want to fully carry out this work, we must first solve various ideological problems.

    Eliminate several ideological obstacles

    Some people believe that summer-sown crop intercropping in wheat fields affects the dense planting of wheat and affects wheat yield. We believe that this statement is one-sided. The increase in total wheat yield is nothing more than two things: one is to expand the wheat field area, and the other is to increase the yield per unit area. From the perspective of expanding the wheat field area, the larger the area of ​​summer-sown crop intercropping in wheat fields, the easier it is to expand the wheat fields, and the more the wheat field area expands, the more the total yield can be increased. Some people will say: Expanding the wheat field area will inevitably increase the total wheat yield; but after the wheat planting width is reduced, will the yield per unit area not decrease? Actually, that is not the case. Doing so will not only not reduce the yield per unit area, but can also increase it. This is how we understand this issue: Reasonable close planting and improving land utilization are important keys to increasing wheat production, but the weather and geographical advantages, time and space should not be separated nor can they be separated. No matter how high the land utilization rate is, it must be achieved through timely cultivation in order to maximize its effect and achieve high yields. This is an aspect to be noted when improving land utilization. Intercropping autumn corn or soybeans in wheat fields is one month or 20 days earlier than planting after the wheat harvest. In this way, not only can these crops increase yield per unit area due to early planting and longer growing period, but also can be harvested 10 to 20 days earlier. Therefore, the mid-stubble wheat for autumn planting can be turned into early-stubble wheat, and the late-stubble wheat can be turned into mid-stubble wheat. The facts of the past few years tell us that, under the same water and fertilizer conditions, the yield difference between early-stubble wheat and late-stubble wheat is very large. At the same time, because wheat is planted early and matures early, it can not only increase yield, but also be harvested early and completely when the rainy season comes, resulting in a bumper harvest. This is also an important key to a wheat bumper harvest.

    Some people believe that it is too troublesome to intercrop summer-sown crops in wheat fields, and it is less labor-intensive to plant after the wheat harvest. This view is also one-sided. It is true that intercropping crops in wheat fields has some difficulties and does require more labor. But considering everything, it is a completely different matter. If wheat field intercropping is not implemented, the wheat field area will be expanded, and the inevitable result is a large summer harvest task, a large amount of threshing work, a large summer planting area, and a large area urgently needing cultivation in summer. The amount of labor required from harvesting to threshing to planting is very large, and the time is very short. If the labor force is not arranged well, the following situation often occurs: one cannot take care of harvesting, one cannot take care of threshing; one cannot take care of threshing, one cannot take care of summer planting; one cannot take care of summer planting, one cannot take care of weeding, and it is easy to lose sight of the other. If the opportunity is missed, it will cause greater passivity and cost more labor. Some people will ask, wheat field intercropping is not a question of whether it is troublesome, but a question of whether it is possible, the row spacing of wheat is three or four inches, and there is no way to intercrop it. This is indeed a problem. But the method of planting wheat can be changed. For example, if peanuts are to be intercropped in the wheat field, the row spacing can be appropriately widened when planting wheat. This is how 300,000 mu of peanuts were intercropped in the entire region this year. For example, if corn is to be intercropped in the wheat field, use the Wendeng five-legged cultivator or the five-row planter to plant, and leave eight or nine inches of ridges, which can facilitate wheat field management and facilitate corn planting.

    Still others believe that wheat field intercropping with peanuts has no problem for increasing grain production, but the peanut planting area is easy to fall short, and the peanut yield per unit area will also be reduced. This question is very important. According to our investigation, implementing wheat field intercropping is an effective way to solve the problem of competition between grain and oil crops. Doing so not only expands the wheat fields, but also ensures the oil crop planting area.

    Reform of the farming system must be arranged early

    The reform of the farming system, as well as the technical reform brought about by the reform of the farming system, cannot be arranged temporarily close to the sowing period, and preparations must be made for the next year in the previous year. From the current point of view, in order to engage in large-scale summer intercropping next year, preparations must be made in this year's autumn planting work. In terms of crop arrangement, this preparation work should not only ensure the timely sowing of wheat fields with a relatively reduced early autumn crop, but also plan the land for spring-sown crops next year in order to change the situation of too many late-stubble land during autumn sowing next year. In terms of farming technology, that is, in terms of wheat planting specifications, necessary technical reforms are also needed according to next year's intercropping requirements.

    总结群众经验　扩大复种面积
    中共山东烟台地委第一书记　李文
    烟台地区最近两年来，在耕作制度方面，有很大的改革。复种指数，由1957年的137％，提高到今年的150％以上；间作套作面积扩大了一倍以上。这种不断扩大播种面积，不断提高土地利用率的做法，充分体现了多种多收与高产多收相结合的方针，对全区的农业生产起了很大的推动作用。
    扩大秋播面积带来了新问题
    但是，耕作制度的改革，也像其他任何事物的发展一样，必然要带来许多急待克服的新矛盾。其中比较明显的：首先是在作物布局上存在矛盾。1960年烟台地区播种面积的扩大，是由小麦及其它夏收作物领先发展的。因为夏收作物面积扩大，必然要减少春播面积，而春播面积减少以后，不仅玉米、甘薯、高粱、谷子以及花生等主要春播作物的播种面积受到直接影响，秋种时麦田和其他秋播作物也因为改茬地较多而存在着实际困难。这种困难突出的表现为保证播种计划与适时播种之间的矛盾。其次，随着春播面积的减少，夏收夏种任务的加重，在全年的劳力安排方面“春松夏紧”的矛盾表现得特别突出。
    矛盾是一切事物发展的动力，我们认识矛盾的目的，正是要积极地找出解决矛盾的办法。由于从领导到群众的共同努力，终于找到了一套有效的措施：就是变夏播作物为麦田套作。全区今年采取交叉套作的夏播作物共有六十万亩左右，其中有麦田套作的花生，也有麦田套作的玉米和大豆。大搞套作有以下几个优点：
    实行麦田套种有三大优点
    第一，可以有计划地把一部分夏播作物改为麦田套作，腾出更多的土地安排春播的高产粮食作物和经济作物。烟台地区，今年除了夏收作物扩大了一百二十万亩以外，油料作物的实播面积也扩大了有五十八万亩，而作为决定全区产量的主要作物——春夏甘薯的播种面积却仍然比去年多十万多亩。这充分证明了夏播作物交叉套作对解决春播作物安排问题所起的显著作用。
    夏播作物交叉套作的面积扩大以后，使大量的夏播作物变成了“半夏子”作物，有些以至于变成了春播作物。这样一来在秋收秋种期间早秋和中秋作物增多了，晚秋作物减少了；早茬和中茬麦田面积增多了，而晚茬麦田面积也就必然减少。从而，在完成播种计划和适时播种方面所存在的矛盾也就迎刃而解。
    第二，在小麦和其他夏收作物播种面积大量扩大的情况下，春播作物的播种面积必然相对地有所减少，夏播作物的播种面积也必然要相对地有所扩大，而随着春夏作物播种面积的变化，各个季度所需要的劳力也必然要引起变化，也就是春季需要的劳力，相对地有所减少，夏季需要的劳力相对有所增多。但是，夏播作物实行交叉套播以后，就可以调剂这种夏紧春松的不平衡情况。以海阳为例，全县夏收面积比去年扩大了十三万六千亩，但是他们在麦收之前共套作了玉米、大豆、花生十六万亩，实际执行的结果，夏种面积不是比过去增加了，而是减少了两万四千多亩。这样就大大减少了在夏收夏种期间劳力不足的矛盾，战胜了洪涝灾害，胜利的完成夏收夏种任务。
    第三，在农作物的生长过程中，阳光和温度是绝不可缺少的重要条件，特别是反映在夏播作物生长上则更为明显。这正如当地农民所说：“早种一天，早收十天”。从农作物的生长中，我们也随时都可以看到这种情况：凡是既适于冬播又适于春播的作物——如小麦、大麦、豌豆，冬播都比春播增产；凡是既适于春播又适于夏播的作物，春播都比夏播增产。这就说明提前播种使作物有较长的生长期，特别是充分利用夏收夏种期间阳光气温更适于作物生长的有利条件，是极为重要的。而变夏播为麦田套作正是体现了这一点。
    麦田套种完全具备条件
    最近几年来，由于水利建设和养猪积肥事业的发展，为耕作技术的提高打下了有利的基础，也为改革耕作制度创造了条件，这是大力推行夏播作物交叉套作的物质条件。另一方面，烟台地区的群众都有间作套作习惯，特别是东部几个县，对夏播作物交叉套作已有相当长的历史，这是大力推行夏播作物交叉套作的群众基础和技术条件。不同的只是过去的夏播套作，是在小麦稀植的情况下进行，而且播种期仅限于麦黄期间。
    但是，变夏播为麦田套作，和其他新事物的发展一样，总是有些习惯于旧做法的人不接受，他们也总是提出一连串的疑问，摆开一大堆困难。例如地委在春季就根据群众中已有的经验提出了这个问题，但是有些地区执行的比较好，也有些地区执行的不够好。执行不够好的地区，主要是在思想上还存在着许多顾虑和错误认识。因此，要想把这一工作全面地开展起来，还必须首先解决各种思想问题。
    排除几种思想障碍
    有的人认为，夏播作物麦田套作影响小麦密植，影响小麦产量。我们认为这种说法是片面的。小麦总产量的提高，不外乎两条：一条是扩大麦田面积，一条是提高单位产量。从扩大麦田面积来说，夏播作物麦田套作面积愈大，扩大麦田也就愈容易，而麦田面积愈扩大，总产量也就愈能提高。有些人会说：扩大麦田面积，小麦总产量必然会提高；但是小麦播幅缩小以后，单位面积产量不是要降低吗？其实不然，这样做单位产量不仅不能降低反而可以提高。我们是这样认识这一问题的：合理密植、提高土地利用率是小麦增产的重要关键，但是天时和地利，时间和空间是不应分开也不能分开的，土地利用率再高，也必须通过耕种适时，才能更大程度的发挥作用，才能达到丰收高产的目的，这是提高土地利用率要注意的一个方面。麦田套种秋玉米或大豆，比麦收后种的要提前一个月或二十天，这样不仅这些作物由于早种生长期长而可以提高单产，而且还能够提前收获十天二十天。从而使秋种的中茬麦子变成早茬麦子，晚茬麦子可以变成中茬麦子。几年来的事实告诉我们，同样水肥条件，早茬麦子和晚茬麦子的产量差别是很大的。同时由于小麦种得早，成熟的也早，既可以提高产量，又可以在雨季来到时，及早地收打完毕，丰产丰收，这同样是小麦丰收的重要关键。
    有的人认为，麦田套作夏播作物太麻烦，不如等小麦收获后种植省工。这种看法也是片面的。麦田套种作物，确实有些困难，也确实要多费工。但是全面考虑一下，就完全是另一回事。如果不实行麦田套种，麦田面积扩大了，随之而来的必然是夏收任务大，脱粒的工作量大，夏种面积大，夏季急于中耕的面积也大，从收割到打场到种完所需要的劳动量非常大，而且时间又非常短促。如果劳力安排不好，经常出现这样一种情况：顾得收割，顾不得打场；顾得打场，顾不得夏种；顾得夏种，顾不得锄草，很容易顾此失彼。倘若错失时机，就会造成更大的被动，花费更大的人工。有些人会问，麦田套作不是麻烦不麻烦，而是可能不可能的问题，小麦行距三、四寸，根本没有办法套作。这确实是个问题。但是小麦的种法是可以改变的。例如麦田要套作花生，种麦时满可以把行距适当放宽一点。今年全区套种三十万亩花生，就是这样做的。又如麦田要套作玉米，用文登五腿耧或用五行播种机种，再留下八九寸的畦埂，就可以既便于麦田管理，又便于点种玉米。
    还有的人认为，麦田套作花生，对粮食增产没有问题，但是花生播种面积容易落空，花生单位产量也要降低。这个问题很重要。据我们调查，实行麦田套种，是解决粮油争地的有效办法。这样做，不仅扩大了麦田，同时也保证了油料播种面积。
    改革耕作制度必须及早安排
    耕作制度的改革，以及因耕作制度的改革而带来的技术改革，都不能临近播种期现作安排，必须上一年度为下一年度作好准备。从当前来说，为了明年大搞夏播套作，就必须在今年秋种工作中作好准备。这种准备工作，在作物安排方面，既要作到在早秋作物相对减少的情况下，保证麦田面积适时播种；又要有计划安排明年春播作物的土地，以便于改变明年秋播时晚茬地偏多的情况。在耕作技术方面，也就是在小麦的播种规格方面，也需要根据明年套作要求，进行必要的技术改革。
