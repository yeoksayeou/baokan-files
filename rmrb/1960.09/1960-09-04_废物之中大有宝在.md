　　There is Great Treasure Among Waste
　　Jiang Lingyun, Wuxi, Jiangsu

　　Some people may not pay much attention to dishwater, often throwing it away without a second thought, rarely considering that there is oil and water to be gained from it. But in our country of 650 million people, aside from individual households cooking, how many people's commune canteens, public canteens, and state-run restaurants are there, and how much dishwater flows out every day! How much can be salvaged from this dishwater that can be utilized! There is treasure to be extracted from dishwater, and our canteen staff should not overlook this small matter.

　　In fact, it is not just dishwater that contains treasure; many things that seem like waste also contain great treasure! For example, using scrap materials can produce chemical products such as caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, sodium sulfate, and sodium oxide. This precisely illustrates that there are things that can be utilized in the waste gas in the sky, the waste materials on the ground, and the wastewater. As long as we have a spirit of diligence and thrift, as long as we are willing to use our brains, we can create a large amount of wealth for the country.

　　To build socialism, we must pay attention to both increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. Extracting treasure from dishwater and finding treasure from waste is not only reducing expenditure but also increasing revenue. If our 650 million industrious and courageous people can all have this spirit, we can create more wealth for the country and accelerate socialist construction.

    废物之中大有宝在
    江苏无锡　江凌云
    对于洗锅水，可能有些人不大重视，多是一倒了之，很少会想到这里面却大有油水可捞。但是我国六亿五千万人民，除一家一户烧饭外，有多少人民公社食堂、公共食堂和国营饭店，每天有多少洗锅水流出去！从这些洗锅水中又将能捞出多少可以利用的东西啊！洗锅水里是有宝可取的，我们的食堂工作人员似乎不应该忽视这件小事情。
    其实何止洗锅水中有宝，许多看起来似乎是废物，其中又何尝不大有宝在！例如利用下脚废料可以制造烧碱、盐酸、元明粉、氧化钠等化工产品。这正说明天上的废气、地上的废料、废水中都有可以利用的东西。只要我们有勤俭节约的精神，只要肯动脑筋，就可以为国家创造大量的财富。
    我们建设社会主义，就要注意开源和节流。从洗锅水中捞宝，从废物中找宝，这不仅是节流，而且是开源。我们六亿五千万勤劳勇敢的人民，如果都能有这种精神，我们就可以为国家创造更多的财富，就可以加速社会主义建设。
