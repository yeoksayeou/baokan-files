    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 12th. Xin Cheng Iron and Steel Plant in Hebei Province, the workers tried every possible way to use less coke and produce more iron, achieved high production, high quality, and low consumption, making the production fully leap forward. In the first seven months of this year, the average coke ratio of the whole factory dropped to 0.77, and from August 1st to 25th it continued to drop to 0.63 (that is, 0.63 tons of coke are used to produce one ton of iron). Not only has the shortage of coke been transformed into a surplus, but it has also promoted the increase of blast furnace utilization coefficient and the quality of pig iron. The cost of pig iron has been reduced by 34% compared with the fourth quarter of last year, and the qualified rate of pig iron has been maintained above 99%. Now the output of pig iron has completed more than 90% of the annual plan.
    Xin Cheng Iron and Steel Plant is a small-sized integrated enterprise. Since the beginning of this year, due to the substantial leap forward in production, the demand for coke has greatly increased. In order to save coke and ensure ironmaking, the factory Party committee put forward the slogan "Love coke as food, and strive to use one pound of coke as two pounds" to all employees, and launched the "ten savings" campaign centered on reducing the ironmaking coke ratio in all production links of the factory. These ten savings include all production links such as coking, mining, crushing, roasting, mechanical operation, and ironmaking, so that the whole factory has formed a "one-stop" saving coke. While employees save coke from the major aspects of improving the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces, improving the coking rate and quality of coking, using white coal to make iron, using peat and sub-coal to make coke, and improving the grade of ore and sintered ore, they also pay attention to eliminating every bit of waste.
    It is a very meticulous task to produce more iron and good iron with a small amount of coke. In order to strengthen the leadership of this work, the factory leaders went to the front line of production in a down-to-earth manner and implemented the "five guarantees" job responsibility system, namely: guarantee the reduction of coke ratio, guarantee high output, guarantee good quality, guarantee safety, and guarantee thinking. For example, in order to overcome the technical difficulties of white coal ironmaking, Hu Daoxin, deputy secretary of the factory Party committee, and Pei Guozhen and Hou Dengrong, deputy directors of the factory, personally planted "experimental fields" at No. 7 blast furnace. They worked hard with workshop cadres and furnace workers to improve the method of feeding the blast furnace, such as increasing the particle size of coal blocks and adding coal evenly, which enhanced the combustion capacity, and also solved the key problem that white coal is prone to explosion and the slag is too sticky to affect production, so that the amount of white coal mixed in has been greatly increased, and the output of pig iron has also been increased by about one time compared with the original. After this experience was promoted in the whole factory, more than 10,000 tons of coke were saved in seven months. Under the influence and leadership of the leaders, the whole factory carried out a widespread chain competition, and everyone contributed ideas and treasures for using less coke and producing more iron. In order to ensure the improvement of ore grade, the mining team set up checkpoints at every level, so that the ore grade was increased by about 10% compared with the past. The workers in the sintering workshop adopted the six-character ore powder sintering method of "screening,配pei, selecting, cleaning, separating, and diligence," which reduced the iron oxide by 30% and increased the iron content by more than 10%. Due to the guaranteed links, concerted efforts, the coke ratio gradually decreased, and the output gradually increased.
    In order to consolidate and promote the advanced experience of using less coke and producing more iron and good iron, the factory also organized a technical research group headed by the deputy secretary of the Party committee and the deputy director of the factory, combined with workshop cadres, technicians, and veteran workers, and selected skilled workers to form two key teams for machinery and furnace to specifically study the high-load ironmaking of coke, prevent and deal with accidents in furnaces and machinery, and summarize the effective advanced experience of the factory and other places, and promote them in a timely manner to improve the production level.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, September 12th. Xianghua Iron and Steel United Enterprise in Hengshan, Hunan Province, has used powder ore, coke powder, and lime mixed together to burn more than 21,000 tons of sintered ore this year, and produced more than 11,700 tons of good iron, saving a lot of ore and coke, and reducing the cost of each ton of iron by 23.8 yuan.
    The ore production and transportation conditions of Xianghua Iron and Steel United Enterprise are not good enough, and there is a lot of powder ore in the ore. Over the past few years, the factory has accumulated about 90,000 tons of powder ore and a large amount of coke powder and lime. At the beginning of this year, the enterprise launched a mass movement to utilize powder ore sintering, and sent four veteran workers and technicians to other iron plants to learn from experience. At the same time, the Party committee secretary led cadres to carry out experimental kilns and experimental furnaces, and after initially gaining experience, they mobilized employees to build 130 kilns on the spot in a simple way. They learned, did, and changed at the same time, and constantly improved output and quality. For example, at the beginning, large kilns were used for sintering, which not only cost a lot of money, but also took two days to burn a kiln, and the work efficiency was not high. Later, the large kilns were changed to small kilns, and some equipment and operation methods were improved. The output of sintered ore per kiln was quickly increased from 200 kg to 400 kg, and the highest was 1,000 kg. The time was shortened to within one hour, and the quality was greatly improved.
    The enterprise used this kind of sintered ore to make iron, which not only did not reduce the output and quality, but increased it. No. 5 blast furnace used 60% of sintered ore and ore to make iron, and the daily output increased from five tons to nine tons. The sintered ore has good air permeability and strong reducibility, so the coke ratio is also reduced by 0.28. (Attached picture)
    After the coking workshop of the Shuizhi Ironmaking Plant of Anyang Iron and Steel Company in Henan Province implemented the three-qin operation method (diligent inspection, diligent temperature measurement and fire adjustment, and diligent cleaning of pipelines), the output has been growing continuously. This is the Red Flag No. 2 coking oven is discharging coke.

    增产焦炭　节约焦炭　多炼钢铁
    新城炼铁厂开展“十项节约”活动焦比降到零点六三
    湘华钢铁联合企业充分利用焦末、粉矿烧制烧结矿增产了生铁
    本报天津12日电　河北省新城炼铁厂职工千方百计少用焦多炼铁，做到了高产、优质、低消耗，使生产全面跃进。今年头七个月，全厂平均焦比降到零点七七，8月1日至25日又继续下降到零点六三（即每炼一吨铁用零点六三吨焦炭）。不但变焦炭不足为有余，而且促进了高炉利用系数和生铁质量的提高，生铁成本比去年第四季降低了34％，生铁合格率一直保持在99％以上，现在生铁产量已经完成年计划的90％多。
    新城炼铁厂是一个小型联合企业。今年以来，由于生产大幅度跃进，所需焦炭大大增加。为了节约焦炭保证炼铁，工厂党委向全体职工提出了“爱焦如粮，力争一斤焦炭顶二斤用”的口号，并在全厂各个生产环节上发动职工开展了以降低炼铁焦比为中心的“十项节约”活动。这十项节约，包括了炼焦、采矿、破碎、焙烧、机械操作、炼铁等各个生产环节，使全厂形成了节约焦炭“一条龙”。职工们既从提高高炉利用系数、提高炼焦的结焦率和质量、利用白煤炼铁、利用泥煤和次煤炼焦以及提高矿石和烧结矿的品位等大的方面节约焦炭，同时也注意杜绝一点一滴的浪费。
    以少量的焦炭多炼铁、炼好铁，是一项十分细致的工作。工厂领导干部为了加强对这一工作的领导，踏踏实实地深入到生产第一线，实行“五包”岗位责任制，即：包焦比降低、包产量高、包质量好、包安全、包思想。例如为了闯过白煤炼铁的技术关，工厂党委副书记胡道信、副厂长裴国珍和侯登荣到七号高炉亲自种“试验田”。他们和车间干部、炉前工一起顽强钻研，实行加大煤块粒度、添煤均匀等改进高炉上料办法，增强了燃烧能力，还解决了白煤爱爆炸和渣性太粘影响生产的关键，使白煤掺入量大大增加，生铁产量也比原来提高了一倍左右。这一经验在全厂推广以后，七个月节省了一万多吨焦炭。在领导干部的影响和带动下，全厂职工普遍开展了连环竞赛，人人为少用焦、多出铁献计献宝。采矿队为保证提高矿石品位，关关设卡，使矿石品位比过去提高10％左右。烧结车间职工采取了“筛、配、选、净、分、勤”六字矿粉烧结法，使氧化铁降低了30％，含铁量提高10％以上。由于环环保证，同心协力，使焦比逐步降低，产量逐步提高。
    为巩固推广少用焦又多出铁、出好铁的先进经验，这个工厂还以党委副书记、副厂长为首，结合车间干部、技术人员、老工人，组织了技术研究组，并且抽调技术好的工人组成机械和炉前两个攻关队，专门研究焦炭高负荷炼铁、预防和处理炉内和机械方面的事故，以及总结本厂和外地的行之有效的先进经验，及时推广，提高生产水平。
    新华社长沙电　湖南省衡山湘华钢铁联合企业今年利用粉矿、焦末和石灰搅拌在一起，烧成了烧结矿两万一千多吨，炼出了一万一千七百多吨好铁，节约了大量的矿石、焦炭，每吨铁成本降低了二十三点八元。
    湘华钢铁联合企业的矿石生产和运输条件不够好，矿石中粉矿多。几年来厂里共积存粉矿约九万吨和大量的焦末、石灰。这个企业今年年初就开展利用粉矿烧结的群众运动，并派出四个老工人和技术员到外地铁厂取经。同时，党委书记带领干部大搞试验窑、试验炉，初步取得经验后，就发动职工因陋就简，就地建了一百三十个窑。他们边学、边做、边改，不断提高产量和质量。如开始烧烧结矿是用大窑，不仅花钱多，而且烧一窑要两天的时间，工效不高，后来将大窑改小窑，又改进一些设备和操作方法，每窑烧结矿的产量很快由二百公斤提高到四百公斤，最高达一千公斤，时间缩短到一小时以内，质量也大大提高。
    这个企业使用这种烧结矿炼铁，不但没有降低产量和质量，相反提高了。五号高炉用60％的烧结矿和矿石一起炼铁，日产量由五吨提高到九吨。烧结矿透气性好，还原性强，所以焦比也降低了零点二八。（附图片）
