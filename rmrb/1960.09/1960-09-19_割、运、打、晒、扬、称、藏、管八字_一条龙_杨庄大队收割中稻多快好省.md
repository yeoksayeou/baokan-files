Xinhua Daily News reported: Cadres and members of the Yangzhuang Brigade in Jinhu Commune, Jianhu County, Jiangsu Province, have summarized their experiences in meticulous harvesting during the Great Leap Forward over the past two years. During the large-scale harvesting of mid-season rice, they comprehensively implemented the "eight-character dragon" measures of "cutting, transporting, threshing, drying, winnowing, weighing, storing, and managing," ensuring that the matured mid-season rice was generally harvested in a timely manner, threshed cleanly in one go, stored in warehouses in one go, and yielded its full production in one go.

The Yangzhuang Brigade is a purely rice-growing area, with a total of 7,960 mu of rice, of which 5,400 mu are mid-season rice. This year, the area of mid-season rice is large, expanded by 50% compared to last year; the variety is singular, last year there were more than seven varieties, this year there are only two varieties, so the maturity period is consistent; the large area grows evenly, the amount of labor is large, last year one person harvested 1.2 mu of rice per day, this year it is estimated that only 0.8 mu can be harvested. If they still followed the harvesting habits of previous years, calculating with the existing labor and animal power, it would take 40 days to rush the harvest to the field, which would not guarantee timely harvesting and a bumper harvest, and may even affect the autumn planting season.

The brigade Party branch told the masses about the three major characteristics of this year's autumn harvest and mobilized everyone to come up with ideas and methods. During the discussion, the members all said: The Party Central Committee calls for vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, and we must do a good job in the autumn harvest, ensuring that every grain is stored in the barn and every blade of grass is stacked. With the idea of ​​a bumper harvest firmly established, the Party branch guided everyone to carefully summarize the experiences and lessons of meticulous harvesting during the Great Leap Forward by arranging work procedures, checking for loopholes, and finding experience. Through repeated arrangement of work and careful searching for loopholes, everyone came to a conclusion: In the past, all those who had bumper harvests were because every process was tightly grasped, one link was connected to another, and every link was not relaxed; as long as there was a slight negligence in one process, some grain would inevitably be scattered and wasted. Finally, the Party branch summarized everyone's opinions and summarized them as the "eight-character dragon" of "cutting, transporting, threshing, drying, winnowing, weighing, storing, and managing": "Cutting" means harvesting at 90% maturity for a 100% yield, harvesting the ripe ones first, cutting flat to the mud, cutting lightly, handling lightly, placing lightly, tying tightly, leaving no stalks in the field, and cutting cleanly; "Transporting" means transporting while cutting, with no rice stalks left overnight in the field, choosing strong and tall people to carry, and if using boats to transport rice stalks, mats should be laid at the places where the boats are loaded and unloaded, and sweeping up dropped ears and grains before stopping work every night; "Threshing" means threshing while transporting, with no rice stalks left overnight on the threshing ground, the threshing ground should be flat, with no cracks, no water accumulation, rice grains should be threshed cleanly, and rice straw should be stacked; "Drying" means drying while threshing, ensuring that the rice grains are dry and the rice straw is dry, drying the rice first and then the straw, and immediately storing the grain in warehouses and stacking the straw in bad weather; "Winnowing" means winnowing to get pure grain, winnowing rice leaves and chaff in the morning, winnowing a second time in the afternoon, and then dividing it into three piles, with full grains, "second best," and chaff stacked separately; "Weighing" means immediately weighing the dried rice and storing it in the warehouse, ensuring that the rice from the current harvest is not mixed with the rice from the next harvest; "Storing" means immediately handing over the rice that should be sold to the state, and immediately storing the rations and seeds in the warehouse for unified management, ensuring that there is no dry rice stored on the threshing ground; "Managing" means storing seeds and rations in separate warehouses, with different varieties managed separately, good and bad managed separately, and establishing and improving the system for managing grain.

After the "eight-character dragon" harvesting measures were formulated, the Party branch secretary and members immediately went to each small team to specifically help solve the problem of implementing the "eight-character dragon" measures. First, they conducted a comprehensive inspection of labor, tools, and threshing grounds. Through the inspection, they transferred 710 laborers, accounting for 78% of the total, to the autumn harvest front; at the same time, they also repaired 20 threshing machines, prepared six brooms, fifteen forks, and eight large and small bamboo baskets at each threshing ground, ensuring that large and small tools were matched; and based on the rice area, they rushed to build 18 threshing grounds. On this basis, they launched a discussion among cadres and the masses to formulate four measures to ensure that every word of the "eight-character dragon" was implemented. First, formulate an autumn harvest battle plan. According to the maturity of mid-season rice and the size of the area, the harvesting work was divided into three battles, and it was stipulated that the production team should make specific arrangements once every two days. Second, rationally arrange labor, organize continuous professional teams, and promote the continuous responsibility system. According to the needs of the autumn harvest, the entire team formed the 710 laborers投入秋收的 into four continuous professional teams for cutting and transporting, threshing and drying, winnowing and weighing, and storing and managing, and ensured that everyone was used to their best. In order to fully mobilize everyone's enthusiasm and ensure the quality of harvesting, in addition to reasonably revising the labor quotas for each type of work and implementing the "five-fixed" (fixed person, fixed time, fixed quality, fixed quantity, fixed work points) responsibility system with tasks assigned to groups and responsibilities assigned to individuals, it was also stipulated that each continuous professional team had the right to check and supervise each other. Third, on the basis of establishing a one-line autumn harvest organization at all levels, all 53 cadres of the large and small teams served as the captains and deputy captains of the professional teams, and 18 branch committee members and brigade cadres also contracted a threshing ground each, serving as the leaders of the threshing ground teams, eating, living, working, and laboring on the threshing ground, and earnestly strengthening the specific leadership of the autumn harvest work. Fourth, continuously organize inspections, evaluations, and competitions, and plant red flags everywhere. The brigade inspected once every three days and evaluated once every five days; the small team inspected once a day and evaluated once every three days. The content of the inspection and evaluation was: check attendance, compare work efficiency; check quantity, compare quality; check plan, compare arrangement; check the continuous link is good, compare the matching is clever.

The mid-season rice harvest of the entire brigade is in full swing. Although the new measures of the "eight-character dragon" have not been implemented for a few days, they have shown their superiority. The members said that it has at least three benefits: First, the harvesting progress is fast and the quality is good, which can harvest more grain. As of the 11th, the entire team has harvested 1,900 mu of mid-season rice, which is more than 30% faster than the same period last year. According to preliminary statistics, each mu will harvest 20 jin more of rice and 50 jin more of rice straw. Second, the output can be seen in time, and the relationship between the state, the collective, and the members can also be arranged in time. The entire team has completed the purchase task of 420,000 jin of grain, and more than 70,000 jin of seeds and rations have been stored in the warehouse, and each small team has specifically arranged the members' grain consumption plan, and began planning grain use from the top of the stack. Third, the labor force is used rationally, so that everyone can be used to their best.

    割、运、打、晒、扬、称、藏、管八字“一条龙”
    杨庄大队收割中稻多快好省
    据新华日报消息　江苏建湖县近湖公社杨庄大队干部社员，总结两年来大跃进中精收细打的经验，在大面积中稻收割中，全面推行“割、运、打、晒、扬、称、藏、管”八字一条龙的措施，使已成熟的中稻普遍做到了适时收割、一次打净、一次入仓、产量一次见底。
    杨庄大队是一个纯水稻地区，共种植水稻七千九百六十亩，中稻占了五千四百亩。今年中稻面积大，比去年扩大50％；品种单一，去年有七个以上品种，今年只有两个品种，因而成熟期一致；大面积生长平衡，用工量大，去年一人一天割稻一亩二分以上，今年估计只能割八分。如果还按照往年的收割习惯，以现有的劳力、畜力计算，四十天才能全部抢收上场，就不能保证全部适时收割、丰产丰收，甚至还要影响秋种茬口。
    大队党支部把今年秋收的三大特点告诉了群众，并发动大家出主意、想办法。讨论中，社员个个都说：党中央号召大办农业、大办粮食，我们一定要把秋收收好，做到颗粒归仓，寸草归垛。丰产丰收的思想坚定了，党支部就引导大家通过排工序、查漏洞、找经验，认真总结了两年大跃进中精收细打的经验与教训。通过反复排工、认真找漏洞，大家得出一个结论：往年凡是丰产丰收的，都是因为道道工序抓得紧，一环扣一环，环环不放松；只要有一道工序上稍有疏忽大意，就免不了要抛撒浪费一些粮食。最后，党支部把大家的意见归纳起来，总结为“割、运、打、晒、扬、称、藏、管”八字一条龙：“割”，就是九成熟十成收，先熟先割，割时平泥下刀，轻割、轻理、轻放、捆紧，田不漏株，割得干净；“运”，就是边割边运，田里不存隔宿稻把，要选体强身高的人挑，如果用船运稻把，上下船的地方要铺席垫，每天晚上收工前普遍扫一次掉穗掉粒；“打”，就是边运边打，场上不放隔宿稻把，场面要平，没有裂缝，不积水，稻谷打不净，稻草不上垛；“晒”，就是边打边晒，保证稻谷干稻草干，先晒稻后晒草，碰到天雨，立即做到谷进仓草上垛；“扬”，就是上扬下净，上午扬稻叶子、草毛子，下午扬二遍，扬后一分三处，饱稻、“二?”、?子分别堆好；“称”，就是稻晒干后立即过秤入仓，做到上场稻谷不与下场混合；“藏”，就是该交售给国家的稻子立即交售给国家，口粮、种子立即进仓，统一保管，做到场上不存干稻；“管”，就是种子、口粮分仓保管，做到品种分管、好次分管，并建立和健全管理粮食的制度。
    “八字一条龙”的收割措施订出来了，党支部书记、委员又立即深入各小队，具体帮助解决“八字一条龙”措施的落实问题。首先对劳力、工具、场头等进行了全面检查。通过检查，把占78％的七百一十个劳动力调到秋收战线；同时还整修了二十台脱粒机，在每个场头上预备了六把扫帚、十五把叉子、八个大小笆斗，做到大小工具配套；并根据水稻面积，赶筑了十八个打场。在此基础上，发动干部群众讨论制订了四项措施，保证了“八字一条龙”字字落实。第一、制订秋收作战计划。按照中稻成熟先后与面积大小，收割工作共分三个战役进行，并规定生产小队两天具体安排一次。第二、合理安排劳动力，组织连环专业队，推行连环责任制。根据秋收需要，全队把投入秋收的七百一十个劳动力分别组成了割运、打晒、扬称、藏管四个连环专业队，并做到人尽其才。为了充分调动每个人的积极性和保证收割质量，除合理修订了各工种的劳动定额和推行任务到组、责任到人的“五定”（定人、定时、定质、定量、定工分）责任制外，还规定每个连环专业队之间，有相互检查与监督的权利。第三、在层层建立秋收一条线组织的基础上，全队五十三个大、小队干部，都分别担任了专业队的正、副队长，其中十八个支委和大队干部还各包一个场头，担任场头组长，做到吃、住、工作、劳动在场头，切切实实加强对秋收工作的具体领导。第四、不断组织检查评比竞赛，大插红旗。大队三天一查、五天一评比；小队一天一查、三天一评比。检查评比内容是：查出勤、比工效；查数量、比质量；查计划、比安排；查连环好、比搭配巧。
    全大队中稻收割正在紧张进行。“八字一条龙”的新措施虽然贯彻还没有几天，但已显示了它的优越性。社员们说，它至少有三个好处：第一、收割进度快、质量好，能多收粮食。到11日止，全队已收割中稻一千九百亩，比去年同期快30％以上。据初步统计，每亩要多收稻谷二十斤、稻草五十斤。第二、产量及时见底，国家、集体、社员三者关系也能及时安排好。全队四十二万斤粮食征购任务已全部完成，并有七万多斤种子、口粮全部入库，各小队都具体安排了社员吃粮计划，从囤尖上就开始计划用粮。第三、劳动力使用合理，做到人尽其才。
