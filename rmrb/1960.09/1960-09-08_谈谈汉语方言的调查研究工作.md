Discussing the Investigation and Research of Chinese Dialects
    Xiong Zhenghui

    Every Chinese speaker can sense that people from Beijing speak differently from people from Guangdong, Shanghai, and Fuzhou. This shows that although Chinese is the common language of the Han nationality, it is not completely unified, and each region's speech has its own characteristics. This local speech is called a dialect in linguistics. Chinese has dialects, and other languages such as Russian, English, and French also have dialects.

    As everyone knows, language plays an extremely important role in social development. People use it to communicate with each other, exchange ideas, and achieve mutual understanding. Without the exchange of ideas, it would be impossible to coordinate people's common activities in social production and social struggle. Without a language understood by the entire society, without a common language for members of a social organization, society would be unable to survive. In our socialist society, language has a particularly important role. The People's Daily editorial on June 6, 1951, "Correctly Use the Language of the Motherland, and Strive for the Purity and Health of the Language," pointed out: "Correctly using language to express thought has great political significance in all work led by the Communist Party today. ... Every document, every report, every newspaper, and every publication of the Party organizations and government organs exists to propagate the truth, instruct tasks and methods to the masses. They have a great influence on the masses, so it is necessary to use correct language to express thought in any document, report, newspaper, and publication, so that the masses can correctly grasp the thought, in order to produce the correct material power." However, the existence of dialects plays a very obstructive role. Therefore, based on the actual situation of our Chinese language, our Party and government have put forward the great task of promoting Putonghua and realizing the standardization of Chinese, pointing out that this is an important part of socialist construction. This requires unifying dialects.

    To unify dialects, we must first conduct a series of investigations and research on dialects. For example, how are dialects produced, what are the laws of dialect development, how do dialects relate to society, what is the relationship between dialects and the national common language (the national common language of the Han people is Putonghua), can we unify dialects, and how can we unify dialects? These are all questions we should clarify. The investigation and research of dialects is a component of linguistics, and this field of study is called dialectology. Of course, conducting dialect investigation and research is not just for the purpose of unifying dialects. Because the emergence of dialects is the result of language development under certain historical conditions and is closely related to the history of the masses who use the language, the development of the language and the historical circumstances of the masses who use it can be reflected in dialects. Therefore, in a sense, dialects are a rich treasure trove. Through the investigation and research of dialects, we can find out the history of a language's development and its development laws, and also provide many clues and corroboration for historical research.

    The investigation and research of Chinese dialects in the decades before liberation only involved a small amount of investigation, and the purpose of the investigation was divorced from reality. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Party, the investigation and research of Chinese dialects has greatly developed. The Ministry of Education and the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly established a phonetic research class to train a group of cadres who can engage in dialect investigation. In order to provide reference materials for the formulation of the Chinese Pinyin scheme, an investigation of the jian-tuan sounds was conducted in the Mandarin-speaking areas of the country. In recent years, some meaningful local dialects have also been investigated in depth. From 1956, a general survey of Chinese dialects was carried out nationwide. The main content of the investigation was phonetics. This work has now been successfully completed. In a country like ours with extremely vast areas and very complex dialects, conducting this nationwide general survey is not only unprecedented in our country's history, but also unparalleled in the world. This is a victory of the Party's leadership and a victory of the Party's mass line.

    Even so, from the requirements put forward by socialist construction, the work done in the past is far from enough. In the future, the investigation and research of Chinese dialects must be carried out on a larger scale.

    To make the work of Chinese dialects develop to a greater extent, we must first solve the problem of the direction of dialect work. In the past, due to the failure to thoroughly eliminate bourgeois academic thought in dialect research, our direction of dialect research was not clear enough. This is manifested in the fact that our past work was not closely integrated with practice. We were almost limited to investigating materials, and did not use these materials to solve practical problems. Now, we must recognize that promoting Putonghua and realizing the standardization of Chinese is a major task in our socialist construction. Therefore, the investigation and research of Chinese dialects must first strive to complete this task. This is the only correct direction. Only by clearly recognizing and unremittingly adhering to this direction can we contribute to socialist construction.

    To truly serve the promotion of Putonghua and the realization of Chinese standardization, we must first run out of our studies and go deep into practice.

    We must first understand what difficulties and problems the masses in various dialect areas and students in local schools mainly encounter when learning Putonghua, and then explore ways to promote Putonghua in a faster, better, and more economical way, targeting these problems. According to the experience of promoting Putonghua in various places, the most important thing is to put politics in command and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses to learn Putonghua. However, after the masses are mobilized, there is almost always such a problem: the Pinyin letters have been learned, and the initials, finals, and tones of Putonghua are pronounced correctly, but it is difficult to remember which sound each character is read in Putonghua. Many people ask for a solution. We should actively study this issue and find a solution. The phonetic correspondence between dialects and Putonghua can help us solve many problems. For example, there is no entering tone in Putonghua, and some characters read with the entering tone in some dialect areas are read in the level, rising, departing, or entering tones in Putonghua. It is very difficult to memorize them one by one. If we point out that the entering tone characters with initials of m, n, l, and r are generally read in the departing tone in Putonghua, and the yang entering tone characters are generally read in the rising tone in Putonghua, then people in some dialect areas can learn Putonghua without spending a lot of time memorizing them one by one. Various places have already made some attempts to use the phonetic correspondence to help learn Putonghua, and have achieved certain results. Many primary and secondary school teachers and some people who learn Putonghua spontaneously seek and use correspondence. However, how should the correspondence be specifically applied to make it play a greater role in the promotion of Putonghua, this is an urgent problem that needs to be solved in front of us.

    Learning Putonghua is not just learning phonetics, but also learning Putonghua vocabulary and grammar, otherwise there will still be many difficulties in communication. For example, after learning the Pinyin letters, the masses in a place in Zhejiang read the sentence "张大着眼睛望着他" (zhāng dà zhe yǎnjīng wàngzhe tā - staring at him with wide eyes) in a book. They can read it correctly in Putonghua according to the phonetic notation, but they don't know what it means, because according to local usage habits and grammar habits, the sentence is "眼睛睁开蛮蛮大望着伊" (yǎnjīng zhēng kāi mán mán dà wàngzhe yī - the eyes open very, very wide staring at him). The requirement of learning Putonghua vocabulary has already been put forward, therefore, how can we help people in dialect areas master Putonghua vocabulary in a faster, better, and more economical way, this is also a problem that needs to be researched and solved.

    Regarding the standardization of Chinese, the urgent problems to be solved at present are the standardization of phonetics and vocabulary, especially the standardization of vocabulary. In terms of phonetic standardization, there are still many problems. For example, the neutral tone and retroflex ending are big problems. Should there be neutral tones and retroflex endings in Putonghua; if so, should they all be based on Beijing pronunciation; if not all based on Beijing pronunciation, what principles should be used to select them? In addition, there are many differences in the pronunciation of many characters. Also, some characters are read in a very chaotic way, and even read incorrectly, due to the interference of the character forms. For example, the character "处" (chǔ, chù - place, to get along with) has two pronunciations, chǔ and chù, and the usages are different. The "处" (chù) in "办事处" (bànshìchù - office) is chù, and the "处" (chǔ) in "相处" (xiāngchǔ - to get along with) is chǔ, but now when saying "和平共处" (hépíng gòngchǔ - peaceful coexistence), "处理" (chǔlǐ - to handle), and "处女" (chǔnǚ - virgin), some people read the "处" (chǔ/chù) in them as chǔ, some people read it as chù, and some people read it as chǔ at one time and chù at another. Another example is that the correct pronunciation of "渗透" (shèntòu - to permeate) is shèntòu, but many people say cāntòu; the correct pronunciation of "参差" (cēncī - uneven) is cēncī, but many people say cāncā; the correct pronunciation of "挪用" (nuóyòng - to misappropriate) is nuóyòng, but many people say náyòng; the correct pronunciation of "塑料" (sùliào - plastic) is sùliào, but many people say suòliào; the correct pronunciation of "柞绸" (zuòchóu - tussah silk) is zuòchóu, but many people say zhàchóu. All these problems need to be researched and solved by us. In terms of vocabulary standardization, which ones are Putonghua vocabularies, many can be affirmed, but there are still many that are difficult to affirm. Due to the relationship of dialects, there are now many words with the same meaning that are popular at the same time. Do we need to determine one as a standard word, what principles should be used to determine it, and what methods should be used to promote those words that are determined as standard? With the development of society, Putonghua needs to constantly absorb dialect words. For example, the word "美国佬" (Měiguólǎo - American) is often used in books and newspapers. This kind of "××佬" is a saying in some southern dialects. What problems arise when absorbing dialect words, what principles should be used to determine which ones to absorb and which ones not to absorb, this is also something we should actively research and solve. In terms of grammar, some divergent formats are related to dialects. We have done even less work in this area in the past, and we should pay attention to carrying out research in the future.

    In order to solve the problems in the standardization of Chinese, we must actively conduct investigations on the one hand, and vigorously carry out research on the other hand. Without investigation, we will not have the material basis for research; but if we only have investigation and neglect research, the things that are investigated will still only be a pile of useless materials. At present, we should conduct a more comprehensive and in-depth investigation and research on Beijing dialect and Northern dialect. Beijing pronunciation is the phonetic standard of Putonghua, and the vocabulary of Beijing dialect also occupies a very important position in the vocabulary of Northern dialect. In the past, although a lot of work has been done on the research of the phonetics and vocabulary of Beijing dialect, it has not been done enough. If we research the phonetics and vocabulary of Beijing dialect deeply, it will be of great help to solving some of the phonetic and vocabulary standardization problems that exist in Putonghua today. The vocabulary of Northern dialect is the basis of Putonghua vocabulary, but the vocabulary divergence within Northern dialect is also not small. Selecting some representative local dialects in the Northern dialect area to conduct a more in-depth vocabulary investigation and compiling them into a dialect dictionary, this is a major task that we urgently need to start working on. This work requires the joint collaboration of the branches of the Academy of Sciences and institutions of higher learning in the Northern dialect area to be completed quickly. Through a comprehensive and in-depth investigation of the vocabulary of Northern dialect, we can clarify the appearance of the vocabulary of Northern dialect, understand the situation of vocabulary divergence within Northern dialect, and find solutions to the problems. In other dialect areas, it is also necessary to conduct more comprehensive and in-depth investigations on some representative points. Some solutions to standardization problems need to be considered from the perspective of the situation of dialects across the country.

    The investigation and research of Chinese dialects is still just beginning in our country. Exactly what should be done to make greater contributions to our country's socialist construction, and exactly what should be done to play a greater role in the promotion of Putonghua and Chinese standardization, are still being actively explored and require the joint efforts of linguists across the country. We must strengthen the study of Mao Zedong Thought and use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide; we must thoroughly criticize bourgeois academic thought and break the shackles of old frameworks; we must dare to think and dare to do, and boldly create. Under the leadership of the Party, and with the active efforts of linguists across the country, the investigation and research of Chinese dialects will surely make a great contribution to our country's socialist construction.

    谈谈汉语方言的调查研究工作
    熊正辉
    每一个说汉语的人都可以感觉得出，北京人说话是一个样，广东人说话是一个样，上海人说话是一个样，福州人说话又是一个样。由此可以看出，汉语虽然是汉民族共同使用的语言，但是并不是完全统一的，每一个地区的话都有一些自己的特点。这种地方话，在语言学上叫做方言。汉语里有方言，其他如俄语、英语和法语等等也都有方言存在。
    大家知道，语言在社会发展中是有着极其重要的作用的。人们利用它来互相交际，交流思想，达到互相了解。如果没有思想交流，那就不可能使人们在社会生产和社会斗争中调协其共同活动。如果没有全社会都懂得的语言，没有社会组织成员共同的语言，那末，社会便会无法生存下去。在我们社会主义社会，语言更有它特殊重要的作用。人民日报1951年6月6日社论《正确地使用祖国的语言，为语言的纯洁和健康而斗争》中曾经指出：“正确地运用语言来表现思想，在今天，在共产党所领导的各项工作中具有重大的政治意义。……党的组织和政府机关的每一个文件，每一个报告，每一种报纸，每一种出版物，都是为了向群众宣传真理、指示任务和方法而存在的。它们在群众中影响极大，因此必须使任何文件、报告、报纸和出版物都能用正确的语言来表现思想，使思想为群众所正确地掌握，才能产生正确的物质的力量。”但是，方言的存在却起着很大的妨碍作用。因此，根据我们汉语的实际情况，我们党和政府提出了推广普通话和实现汉语规范化的伟大任务，指出这是社会主义建设中重要的一环。这就要求把方言统一起来。
    要统一方言，就必须首先对方言进行一系列的调查研究。比如，方言是怎么产生的，方言发展的规律是什么，方言同社会的关系如何，方言同民族共同语（汉族的民族共同语就是普通话）的关系是怎么样的，我们能不能统一方言，怎么样统一方言，这些问题都是我们应该弄清楚的。方言的调查研究是语言学的一个组成部分，这门学问叫方言学。当然，进行方言的调查研究，还不只是为了统一方言。由于方言的产生是语言在一定历史条件下发展的结果，同使用这一语言的人民群众的历史有密切联系，所以语言发展的情况和使用这一语言的人民群众的历史情况在方言里都可以找到很多反映。因此，从某种意义上说，方言是一个丰富的宝库。通过对方言的调查研究，可以找出一个语言的发展历史及其发展规律，还可以为历史学的研究提供很多线索和佐证。
    汉语方言的调查研究，在解放前的几十年里，只做了很少一些调查，调查的目的也是脱离实际的。中华人民共和国成立后，在党的领导下，汉语方言的调查研究得到了很大的发展。教育部和中国科学院语言研究所合办了语音研究班，培训了一批能够从事方言调查的干部。为了给汉语拼音方案的制订提供参考资料，对全国官话区进行过尖团音的调查。几年来，还深入地调查了一些有意义的地点方言。从1956年起，开展了全国汉语方言的普遍调查。调查的内容主要是语音。这项工作现在已经胜利完成了。在我国这样一个地区极其辽阔、方言十分复杂的国家里，进行这种全国规模的普查，不仅在我国历史上是空前的，就是在世界上也是没有过的。这是党的领导的胜利，是党的群众路线的胜利。
    虽然这样，从社会主义建设给我们提出的要求来看，过去的工作还是远远不够的。今后，汉语方言的调查研究必须有更大规模的开展。
    要使汉语方言工作得到更大的开展，就首先必须解决方言工作的方向问题。过去，由于方言研究工作中的资产阶级学术思想没有得到彻底的清除，我们对方言研究的方向是不够明确的。这表现在，我们过去的工作同实际结合得不紧密。我们几乎只限于调查材料，而没有运用这些材料来解决实际问题。现在，我们必须认识，推广普通话和实现汉语规范化是我们社会主义建设中的一个重大任务。因此，汉语方言的调查研究就首先必须为完成这个任务而努力。这是唯一正确的方向。只有明确地认识和不懈地坚持这个方向，才能为社会主义建设作出贡献。
    我们要真正做到为推广普通话和实现汉语规范化服务，就首先必须跑出书斋，深入实际。
    我们必须首先了解各方言区的群众和各地学校的学生在学习普通话时主要有些什么困难，有些什么问题，然后针对这些问题来探索多快好省的推广普通话的方法。根据各地推广普通话的经验来看，最主要的是要政治挂帅，要充分发动群众学习普通话的热情。但是在群众发动起来之后，差不多都有这样一个问题：拼音字母学会了，普通话的声母、韵母、声调都发得很正确了，可是在普通话里哪个字读哪个音很难记住。有不少群众要求有一个解决的办法。我们应该积极研究这个问题，找出解决的办法。方言同普通话的语音对应规律可以帮助我们解决不少问题。比如，普通话里没有入声，一些方言区里读入声的字，在普通话里有的读阴平，有的读阳平，有的读上声，有的读去声。如果一个个去记，那是很困难的。如果我们指出，声母是m、n、l、r的入声字，在普通话里一般都读去声，阳入的入声字在普通话里一般都读阳平，那末，一些方言区的人学普通话时就可以不必花很多时间一个一个地去死记了。各地已经有一些运用语音对应规律来帮助学习普通话的尝试，并且取得了一定的效果。也有不少中小学教师以及一些学习普通话的群众自发地寻找和运用对应规律。但是，到底应该怎样具体应用对应规律，使对应规律在推广普通话工作中发挥更大的作用，这是摆在我们面前急需解决的问题。
    学习普通话不只是学习语音，还要学习普通话的词汇、语法，否则在交际时仍然会有很多困难。比如，浙江有个地方的群众在学会拼音字母后，在书上读到“张大着眼睛望着他”这么一句话。他们按照注音能正确地用普通话读出来，却不知道是什么意思，因为按照当地用词习惯和语法习惯，这句话是“眼睛睁开蛮蛮大望着伊”。学习普通话词汇的要求已经提出来了，因此，怎样才能帮助方言区的人多快好省地掌握普通话的词汇，这也是需要我们研究解决的问题。
    关于汉语规范化，当前急需解决的是语音和词汇的规范问题，特别是词汇规范问题。在语音规范方面，现在还存在不少问题。比如，轻声、儿化就是一个大问题。究竟普通话里要不要轻声和儿化；如果要，是否全根据北京音；如果不全根据北京音，又根据什么原则来选择。此外，还有很多字的读音有分歧。还有一些字由于字形的干扰，所以读音很混乱，甚至读错了。如“处”字，有chǔ、chù两种读音，用法不同，“办事处”的“处”是chù，“相处”的“处”是chǔ，可是现在说“和平共处”、“处理”、“处女”时，其中的“处”字有人读chǔ，有人读chù，有人一会儿读chǔ，一会儿读chù。又如“渗透”的正确读音是shèntòu，现在很多人说cāntòu；“参差”的正确读音是cēncī，很多人说cāncā；“挪用”的正确读音是nuóyòng，很多人说náyòng；“塑料”的正确读音是sùliào，很多人说suòliào；“柞绸”的正确读音是zuòchóu，很多人说zhàchóu。以上这些问题都是需要我们研究解决的。在词汇规范方面，究竟哪些是普通话词汇，有很多是可以肯定了，但是还有很多难以肯定。由于方言的关系，现在同时流行很多意义相同的词，我们是否需要确定一个作为规范的词，应该根据什么原则来确定，又采用什么方式来推广那些确定为规范的词。随着社会的发展，普通话需要不断地吸收方言词，比如书刊报纸上常常用到“美国佬”这个词，这种“××佬”就是南方一些方言里的说法。在吸收方言词时有些什么问题产生，应该根据什么原则来确定吸收哪些，不吸收哪些，这也是我们应该积极研究解决的问题。语法方面，也有一些分歧格式同方言有关系。在这方面我们过去做的工作更少，今后也应该注意开展研究。
    为了解决汉语规范化中的问题，我们必须一方面积极进行调查，一方面大力展开研究。没有调查，我们就没有研究的材料基础；但是光有调查，忽视研究，调查来的东西也仍只是一堆没有用的材料。当前，我们应该对北京话和北方话进行比较全面、深入的调查和研究。北京语音是普通话的语音标准，北京话的词汇在北方话词汇中也占着很重要的地位。过去，对北京话的语音、词汇的研究虽然做了不少工作，但是还做得不够。如果对北京话的语音、词汇研究得深透了，那对当前普通话中存在的一些语音、词汇的规范问题的解决是会有很大帮助的。北方话的词汇是普通话词汇的基础，但是北方话内部的词汇分歧也不小。在北方话区选择一些有代表性的地点方言进行比较深入的词汇调查，编辑成方言词典，这是我们当前急需着手进行的一项重大的任务。这项工作需要北方话区里的科学院分院和高等院校的共同协作才能迅速完成。通过对北方话词汇的全面深入的调查，我们就可以弄清楚北方话词汇的面貌，摸清北方话内部词汇分歧的情况，并找出解决问题的办法。在其他方言区，也需要对一些代表点进行比较全面深入的调查，有一些规范问题的解决是需要从全国方言的情况出发来考虑的。
    汉语方言的调查研究工作在我国还是刚刚开始。究竟应该怎样做才能在我国的社会主义建设中作出更大的贡献，究竟应该怎样做才能在推广普通话和汉语规范化工作中发挥更大的作用，目前还在积极探索，需要全国的语言工作者共同努力。我们必须加强毛泽东思想的学习，以毛泽东思想作指导；必须彻底地批判资产阶级学术思想，打破旧框框的束缚；必须敢想敢干，大胆创造。在党的领导下，在全国语言学工作者的积极努力下，汉语方言的调查研究一定会在我国的社会主义建设事业中作出巨大的贡献。
