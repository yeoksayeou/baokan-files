Xinhua News Agency, 10th September. President Sékou Touré of the Republic of Guinea's speech at the airport. The full text is as follows: Dear Chairman, dear friends, dear ministers, political leaders, ladies and gentlemen:

　　The members of the Guinean delegation are deeply moved by your warm and sincere reception. Before arriving in Beijing, all the Guinean people, members of the government, and members of this delegation currently with you, were completely certain of the active solidarity and friendship of the Chinese people towards the Guinean people, towards the people of all African countries, and towards all the peoples of the world who love peace and justice as much as your great people.

　　We know that the fraternal friendship that unites the peoples of Africa and Asia has political and historical foundations. This friendship is born of their shared recognition of the disturbing reality of our humanity; their common hatred of imperialism and colonialism strengthens this friendship, and their common determination to continue the struggle until imperialism is eliminated, so that every country in the world can control its own destiny in freedom and dignity.

　　Therefore, we want to say to you that we are not tourists, like you, we are fighters; we have come to visit not only to understand all the progress your revolution has achieved, but also to learn lessons that can be applied to the existing conditions of the African struggle, so that we can realize our program of justice, democracy, progress, and human civilization in concerted action and the broadest understanding, and be beneficial to the various social progress undertakings of mankind.

　　This is why we hope that peace will quickly triumph over war, that is to say: imperialism and colonialism will be eliminated from our world due to the political awareness and struggle of the people of all countries; we hope that fraternal friendship and human unity will become the criteria of life between countries; we value the great contribution of your revolution, and the continuous efforts you make day after day, this contribution and effort is pushing back the boundaries of poverty and war in favor of justice and peace.

　　With this confidence, please allow me to shout:

　　Long live the friendship and fraternity between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Guinea!

　　Long live to the great active solidarity of the people of Asia and Africa!

　　Down with colonialism and imperialism, let the people of all countries live in peace!

    塞古·杜尔总统的讲话
    新华社10日讯　几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔在机场上的讲话。全文如下：亲爱的主席，亲爱的朋友，亲爱的部长们，政治领袖们，女士们，先生们：
    几内亚代表团的成员对你们亲切和诚挚的接待，深深地受到感动。在到达北京以前，全体几内亚人民、政府成员，以及目前同你们在一起的本代表团成员，完全确信中国人民对几内亚人民、对非洲各国人民、以及对像贵国伟大人民一样热爱和平与正义的所有世界各国人民的积极团结和友谊。
    我们知道，把非洲和亚洲各国人民联结在一起的兄弟情谊是有政治和历史基础的。这种情谊是由他们对于我们人类的令人不安的现实的共同认识所产生的；他们对于帝国主义和殖民主义的共同仇恨加强了这种情谊，他们共同决心继续进行斗争，直到帝国主义消灭，从而使世界上每一个国家都能在自由和尊严中主宰自己的命运。
    因此，我们要向你们说，我们不是旅客，像你们一样，我们是战士；我们前来访问不仅是为了了解你们的革命所取得的一切进步，而且是为了吸取可以适用于非洲斗争的现有条件的教训，从而使我们能在一致行动和最广泛的谅解中来实现我们的正义、民主、进步和人类文明的纲领，而有利于人类的各种社会进步事业。
    这就是为什么我们希望和平迅速地战胜战争，即是说：由于各国人民的政治觉悟和斗争而使帝国主义和殖民主义从我们的世界上消灭；我们希望亲如兄弟的情谊和人类的团结成为国与国之间的生活的准则；我们重视你们革命的伟大贡献，重视你们日复一日不断作出的努力，这种贡献和努力正在使贫困和战争的边界线向后退却而有利于正义与和平。
    凭着这种信心，请允许我高呼：
    中华人民共和国和几内亚共和国的友好和兄弟情谊万岁！
    亚非各国人民的伟大积极团结万岁！
    打倒殖民主义和帝国主义，让各国人民在和平中生活！
