Xinhua News Agency, London, September 25th: After a two-week "fact-finding" trip to the "Central African Federation," where national independence movements are surging, British Commonwealth Relations Secretary Duncan Sandys returned to London on the 24th. During this time, the people of Central Africa held large-scale demonstrations to boycott Sandys' "visit" and demand independence and freedom.

The "Central African Federation" was pieced together by Britain from its "self-governing" Southern Rhodesia and two "protectorates" - Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Sandys' "visit" to the "Central African Federation," following the activities of British Colonial Secretary Macleod earlier this year and the "Monckton Commission" appointed by the British government, was to continue seeking ways to maintain this "federation" and the continuation of British colonial rule over the people of Central Africa.

On the eve of Sandys' visit, the main nationalist party of Nyasaland, the Malawi Congress Party, announced a boycott of Sandys' "visit" to protest the continued imprisonment of African nationalists in Nyasaland. In Northern Rhodesia, African nationalists demanded immediate withdrawal from the "federation" and independence.

Africans in Southern Rhodesia held demonstrations when Sandys arrived in Salisbury. They shouted slogans demanding freedom and opposing the police state. African leaders of the Southern Rhodesia National Democratic Party - the successor to the banned African National Congress - condemned racial discrimination in Southern Rhodesia during talks with Sandys. They demanded that a constitutional conference be convened within two months to revise the constitution of Southern Rhodesia and demanded that the current constitution be suspended.

During his visit, Sandys held lengthy talks with "Central African Federation" Prime Minister Welensky and Southern Rhodesia Prime Minister Edgar Whitehead on the current situation and the future status of the federation, including Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

According to newspaper reports, Sandys and Welensky clashed over the recommendations of the "Monckton Commission," which was appointed to offer opinions on the future constitution of the "Central African Federation," so Sandys postponed his return home by one day.

In view of the upsurge in the African national independence movement and the growing opposition of the Central African people to the federation imposed on them, the "Monckton Commission," in order to maintain British colonial rule, suggested that Africans should have some seats in the "Federal" Parliament, or agree to withdraw from the "Federation" under certain conditions after five years. On the other hand, Welensky advocated flagrant suppression of the African people in order to maintain the dominance of white colonists within the "Federation."

In fact, the promise to withdraw from the "Federation," supposedly "recommended by the Monckton Commission," which was opposed by African nationalists, is just a deception. Because, in addition to a trial period of up to five years, it is also stipulated that any member of the "Federation" wishing to withdraw must have a "responsible government." It is also stipulated that the desire to withdraw from the "Federation" should be expressed by both black and white residents. This means that withdrawal from the Federation must be approved by the reactionary white colonists.

While playing the trick of promising to give Africans more rights, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, controlled by Britain and the United States, is preparing to strengthen its military bases in Central Africa and step up the suppression of the African national liberation movement. According to recent newspaper reports, British Chief of Staff Lord Mountbatten will visit the "Federation" early next month to discuss the "threat of communist infiltration" and the "defense status of British Africa" with Welensky. For some time, there have been rumors about NATO and British plans to build missile bases in Southern Rhodesia. According to newspaper reports, the Ruwa area, fifteen miles from Salisbury, has recently been selected as the site of the base.

### 中非人民坚决要求独立自由　英联邦关系大臣的活动遭到抵制

　　中非人民坚决要求独立自由
　　英联邦关系大臣的活动遭到抵制
    新华社伦敦25日电　英国联邦关系大臣桑迪斯在民族独立运动高涨的“中非联邦”作了两个星期的
  “了解情况”的旅行以后，24日回到伦敦。这期间，中非人民举行了声势浩大的示威，抵制桑迪斯的“访问”，要求独立和自由。
    “中非联邦”是由英国把它的“自治领”南罗得西亚和两个“保护地”——北罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰拼凑而成的。桑迪斯继年初英国殖民大臣麦克劳德，和英国政府指派的“蒙克顿委员会”到中非活动之后“访问”“中非联邦”，是为了继续寻找保持这个“联邦”和继续维持英国对中非人民殖民统治的方法。
    在桑迪斯访问前夕，尼亚萨兰的主要民族主义政党马拉维国民大会党宣布抵制桑迪斯的“访问”，以表示抗议继续监禁尼亚萨兰的非洲民族主义者。在北罗得西亚，非洲民族主义者要求立即退出“联邦”而独立。
    南罗得西亚的非洲人在桑迪斯抵达索耳兹伯里时举行了示威。他们高呼要求自由和反对警察国家的口号。南罗得西亚民族民主党——被取缔的非洲人国民大会的继承者——的非洲领袖们在同桑迪斯举行会谈时谴责南罗得西亚的种族歧视。他们要求在两个月内召开制宪会议，来改订南罗得西亚的宪法，要求暂停执行现行的宪法。
    桑迪斯在访问期间同“中非联邦”总理韦伦斯基和南罗得西亚总理埃德加·怀特赫德，就当前局势和包括南罗得西亚、北罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰的联邦的未来地位作了长谈。
    据报纸报道，桑迪斯和韦伦斯基之间，对被任命就“中非联邦”的未来宪法提出意见的“蒙克顿委员会”的建议发生了争执，因此桑迪斯推迟一天回国。
    鉴于非洲民族独立运动的高涨和中非人民日益反对强加于他们的联邦，“蒙克顿委员会”为了维持英国的殖民统治，建议让非洲人在“联邦”议会中拥有若干席位，或者同意五年后在某种条件下可以退出“联邦”。另一方面，韦伦斯基则主张悍然镇压非洲人民，以便在“联邦”的范围内保持白种殖民者的优势。
    事实上，遭到非洲民族主义者反对的、据说由“蒙克顿委员会建议”的退出“联邦”的许诺，只是一种欺骗。因为除了长达五年的试验时期外，还规定：“联邦”的任何一个成员要退出“联邦”，必须拥有一个“负责的政府”。又规定，应由黑人居民和白种居民表示退出“联邦”的愿望。这意味着退出联邦必须得到反动的白种殖民者的同意。
    在玩弄要给非洲人更多的权利的诺言的同时，英国和美国所控制的北大西洋公约组织正准备加强它们在中非的军事据点和加紧镇压非洲的民族解放运动。据报纸最近报道，英国参谋长蒙巴顿伯爵将在下月初访问“联邦”，同韦伦斯基讨论“共产主义渗入的威胁”和“英属非洲的防御地位”问题。若干时候以来，流传着关于北大西洋公约组织和英国计划在南罗得西亚建立导弹基地的消息。据报纸报道，距离索耳兹伯里十五英里的鲁瓦地区最近被挑选为基地所在地。
