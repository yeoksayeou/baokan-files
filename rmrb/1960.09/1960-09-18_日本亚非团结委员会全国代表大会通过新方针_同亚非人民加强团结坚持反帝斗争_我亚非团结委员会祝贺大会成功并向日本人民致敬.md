Representatives from twenty-two national and local organizations and activists in the movement to strive for Asia-Africa solidarity attended the congress.

The new guidelines also emphasize that the Asia-Africa solidarity movement should be expanded and massified based on the strength demonstrated by the Japanese people in the struggle against the "Security Treaty," and at the same time, they should more firmly unite with the two billion people of Asia and Africa.

According to the new guidelines, the Solidarity Committee will strengthen various activities, convey the spirit of the Asia-Africa People's Solidarity Conference, and publicize the important significance of Asia-Africa people's solidarity.

Regarding organizational issues, the new guidelines state that the committee will do its utmost to unite the activists in the working class, youth, students, women, and peasant movements around the committee and enable various mass organizations to participate in this committee.

The congress also passed a resolution condemning the United Nations' interference in the internal affairs of the Congo, expressing support for the just struggle of the Congolese people.

Another resolution passed by the congress demanded the immediate restoration of diplomatic relations with China.

Other resolutions passed by the congress include: opposing the planned so-called "normalization of relations" talks between Japan and South Korea, demanding the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in Asia and Africa, demanding the return of Okinawa to Japan, and demanding an unconditional extension of the agreement on the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan.

The meeting also passed a telegram supporting the struggle of the Cuban government and the Cuban people.

The congress elected a representative committee composed of eight people and one hundred and five standing directors. The members of the representative committee are Akira Kazami, Kenzo Nakajima, Kaoru Ota, Ikuo Yasui, and Yoshitaro Hirano, among others.

Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: The China Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee sent a telegram to the Japan Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee on the 16th, congratulating the Japan Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee on holding the congress.

The telegram said: "The China Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee, on behalf of the Chinese people, warmly congratulates the convening of the Japan Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee Congress and, through the congress, extends its heartfelt respect to the Japanese people who are committed to the Asia-Africa solidarity movement and are struggling for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality.

"The victories achieved by the heroic Japanese people in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance, against U.S. military bases, and in defense of peace have greatly encouraged the people of Asia, Africa, and other countries of the world in the struggle against the imperialist aggressive and war forces headed by the United States, and have made significant contributions to strengthening the Asia-Africa people's solidarity against imperialism and to the noble cause of defending Asian and world peace.

"The Chinese people have always firmly supported the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, and have consistently advocated the establishment of friendly relations with Asian and world countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and have made a series of sincere and unremitting efforts for this purpose. The Chinese and Japanese people support and encourage each other in the struggle against our common enemy—U.S. imperialism, and the friendship between the two peoples has been further developed. We are deeply convinced that, with the support of the unprecedentedly powerful forces of the people of the world, the just struggle of the Japanese people will surely overcome difficulties, continue to advance, and achieve new and greater victories. We wish the congress success."
