Fuzhou, September 17 (Reported by this newspaper) – The vast urban and rural people of Fujian Province are seizing the excellent opportunity of high temperatures and abundant rainfall in early autumn, when vegetables grow quickly, and are launching a rush to plant autumn and winter melons and vegetables. After the busy summer harvest and planting, Changting County in the mountainous area of western Fujian immediately seized the season to plant vegetables in a concentrated effort, expanding and intercropping melons and vegetables by more than 12,000 mu in four days. In the coastal Longxi Special Zone, the people's communes, while focusing on autumn field management, have established a 22,000-strong vegetable production team, carrying out a melon and vegetable planting campaign that combines specialized team planting with mass concentrated efforts. The farmers, fishermen, and salt workers on Dongshan Island, who have always relied on the mainland for vegetable supplies, are also using the method of mixing guest soil to improve the sandy beaches, planting thousands of mu of melons and vegetables. Forestry workers fighting in the dense forests of northern Fujian are also reclaiming wasteland and rushing to plant vegetables in their spare time. Seventy-two of the 170 units have achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables, and thirty-two units have achieved half self-sufficiency. The vast urban residents, government organizations, schools, and workers at industrial and mining enterprises and construction sites throughout the province are also enthusiastically participating in the upsurge of expanding vegetable planting.

People's communes in various regions have generally expanded vegetable production bases into bases for producing vegetables, raising pigs, and other non-staple foods. These bases are managed by specialized vegetable production teams, which use vegetable leaves, melon vines, and bean stalks to raise pigs, and then use pig manure to fertilize the vegetables, thereby achieving a double harvest of meat and vegetables. After implementing simultaneous vegetable planting and pig raising, more than 1,000 canteen non-staple food production teams (groups) in Youxi County planted more than 23,000 mu of vegetables and raised more than 29,000 pigs, achieving a surplus of self-sufficiency in non-staple foods such as vegetables, meat, and eggs.

Hangzhou, September 17 (Reported by this newspaper) – Zhejiang Province has planted more than 800,000 mu of various vegetables. Currently, various regions are seizing the current favorable opportunity to plant enough autumn vegetables and plant them well according to plan.

Party committees at all levels in Zhejiang Province are grasping vegetable production as they grasp grain production. The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee issued instructions on seizing the current favorable opportunity to vigorously plant vegetables, deciding to launch a mass movement to vigorously plant vegetables from rural to urban areas for 20 days starting from the 1st of this month. The Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee recently organized more than 5,000 people, including secretaries in charge of logistics, directors of public canteens, and captains of vegetable specialized teams, to inspect the vegetable production of more than 6,900 public canteens in the city, establish pace-setters, identify shortcomings, summarize experiences, and conduct an education on vigorously planting vegetables for cadres and the masses. They delved deeply into the potential of the land, formulated a vegetable production plan for the second half of the year, and immediately adopted various effective measures to implement it. In the Ningbo area, public canteens were used as units to organize more than 10,000 vegetable specialized teams, and the masses were mobilized to vigorously engage in mass movements and focus on autumn vegetable production.

In the vigorous efforts to produce autumn vegetables, various regions have rationally arranged the production of commercial vegetables. Six counties, including Changxing, Anji, Jiaxing, Haining, and Deqing, have established six commercial vegetable bases with an area of over 1,000 mu each. In counties such as Qu County, Jiangshan, and Jiande, a deputy secretary of the Party committee or a director of the commune is assigned to be specifically responsible for vegetable production in key communes where industrial and mining enterprises are located. Currently, Jiangshan and Jiande counties have established 113 specialized teams for producing commercial vegetables, planting more than 6,950 mu of vegetables. In addition, various regions are actively expanding the production of special vegetables. Nansun Commune in Wuxing County, the origin of the famous Jiaxing dish, pickled mustard tuber, has doubled the planting area of pickled mustard tuber this year compared to last year. The planting area of snow cabbage in the Ningbo area has also increased compared to previous years. Various regions are also cultivating while planting, ensuring the normal growth of autumn vegetables.

Shanghai, September 17 (Reported by this newspaper) – By the end of August, canteens in various counties of Shanghai had planted 150,000 mu of vegetables. Recently, according to the instructions of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, suburban counties have further strengthened the leadership of canteen vegetable planting, and organizations leading canteen vegetable production have been established from the commune to the production team level, taking measures to ensure the four aspects of land, labor, variety, and yield are implemented. The Qingpu County Committee of the Communist Party of China organized two county-wide inspections centered on canteen vegetable planting. By the end of August, canteens in this county had planted more than 16,900 mu of vegetables, averaging seven li per person. Many grassroots cadres also conscientiously and diligently focused on canteen vegetable production. When the deputy secretary of the Party branch of the Xiaodang Production Team of the Situan Commune in Fengxian County was working in the Ninth Team, he repeatedly studied the issue of vegetable planting and eating by commune members with the team cadres and helped them summarize their experience. Now, the commune members of this team can eat enough fresh vegetables every day and have stored thousands of kilograms of dried vegetables.

In order to ensure that canteens plant enough vegetables and plant them well, Shanghai's suburbs have fully utilized the "four sides" and "ten edges" to expand the vegetable planting area without occupying large tracts of farmland, ensuring that each person has six li of vegetable land. The Minhua Production Team of the Gusong Commune in Songjiang County mobilized the masses to "plant in every available space," planting vegetables on scattered plots of land, averaging nearly nine li of vegetable land per commune member. Some production teams and teams also engaged in intercropping and mixed cropping to increase land utilization as much as possible. The Hongguang Production Team of the Ganxiang Commune in Jinshan County, based on seasonal, soil, and other natural conditions, rotated the planting of vegetables in batches, ensuring that one crop follows another, with five crops rotated throughout the year. As a result, the commune members of the 19 canteens in this team can eat more than two jin of vegetables per person per day on average and have also stored a lot of potatoes, onions, dried melons, and dried vegetables.

Chengdu, September 17 (Reported by this newspaper) – The Chengdu Municipal Party Committee recently allocated a portion of the commercial vegetable land in the suburbs of the city to be jointly operated by some larger factories, enterprises, government organizations, universities, and urban people's communes, and rural people's communes, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the urban people to run agriculture and helping these factories and government organizations establish self-sufficient vegetable production bases.

As soon as this method of combining urban and rural areas and having all the people plant vegetables was proposed, it was immediately warmly supported by the vast number of workers and urban commune members in the urban area. Various units quickly took action and launched an upsurge of vigorously planting vegetables. At present, the city's units have an average of 60,000 to 70,000 laborers engaged in autumn vegetable sowing every day. More than 20,000 urban commune members are also working side by side with farmers, launching a concentrated vegetable planting campaign. In order to ensure the need for vegetable fertilizer, the workers of many units are also actively carrying out fertilizer accumulation work in their spare time.

When Chengdu allocated vegetable land to various units, it was done based on the principles of strengthening leadership, overall planning, and unified arrangements, without changing the commune system or organization. The units planting vegetables all participated in the leadership and planning of the commune, and supported it with labor and fertilizer.

The effect of implementing the method of allocating a portion of commercial vegetable land from the suburbs to be jointly operated by some government units and people's communes in the city is multifaceted. First, after the city's units and urban people's communes jointly operate vegetables with the suburban communes, they are not only consumers of vegetables but also direct producers of vegetables, so that the urban people are not only concerned about the supply of vegetables but also about the production of vegetables. Second, after the allocation of vegetable land, government units in the urban area can frequently or regularly allocate more labor to strengthen the vegetable production front, can better cultivate intensively, plant the vegetable land better, and increase the production of more vegetables. Third, the implementation of the method of combining urban and rural areas can unify the production, distribution, and consumption of vegetables within the government and enterprises, greatly reducing intermediate links. Fourth, it is conducive to strengthening the links between urban and rural areas, industry and agriculture, and agricultural production receives more direct and stronger support from the city, which is conducive to the technical transformation of agriculture. Fifth, the urban units and communes have fixed labor bases, which can enable the urban people to participate in labor more frequently. (Attached picture)

    福建抓住初秋有利季节掀起抢种瓜菜运动
    浙江城乡群众大干20天力争秋菜种足种好
    上海市各县食堂大种蔬菜　成都一些工厂机关建立蔬菜基地
    本报福州17日电　福建省广大城乡人民抓紧初秋气温较高，雨水较多，菜蔬长得快的大好时机，掀起抢种秋、冬瓜菜热潮。闽西山区的长汀县在夏收夏种大忙结束后，即抓住季节，突击种菜，四天就扩种、套种瓜菜一万二千多亩。沿海地区的龙溪专区各人民公社，在大抓秋田管理同时，建立了二万二千多人的蔬菜生产专业队，开展专业队种和群众性突击种相结合的播种瓜菜运动。历来依靠大陆供应蔬菜的东山岛上的农渔盐民，也采用掺客土改造沙滩的办法，种植了几千亩瓜菜。奋战在闽北高山密林中的林业职工，也利用业余时间开荒抢种。一百七十个单位中已有七十二个单位实现蔬菜自给，三十二个单位实现半自给。全省各地广大城镇居民机关学校和各工矿企业基本建设工地职工也都热火朝天地投入扩种蔬菜热潮。
    各地人民公社普遍把蔬菜生产基地扩大成种菜、养猪等副食品生产基地，由蔬菜生产专业队负责经营管理，利用菜叶、瓜藤，豆秆等养猪，又以猪肥肥菜，从而获得了肉、菜双丰收。尤溪县一千多个食堂副食品生产队（组）在实行边种菜边养猪后，共计种菜二万三千多亩，养猪两万九千多头，作到菜、肉、蛋等副食品自给有余。
    本报杭州17日电　浙江省已种下各种蔬菜八十万多亩。目前，各地正抓住当前有利时机，按计划把秋菜种足、种好。
    浙江省各级党委都像抓粮食一样抓蔬菜生产。中共浙江省委、浙江省人民委员会发布了关于抓紧当前有利时机大种蔬菜的指示，决定从本月1日起，大干二十天，从农村到城市掀起一个大种蔬菜的群众运动。杭州市委最近组织了各级管后勤工作的书记、公共食堂主任、蔬菜专业队队长等五千余人，对全市六千九百多个公共食堂的蔬菜生产作了检查，树立标兵，摆对立面，总结经验，向干部和群众进行了一次大种蔬菜的教育，深入挖掘土地潜力，作出了下半年的蔬菜生产规划，并且立即采取各种有效措施，贯彻执行。宁波地区以公共食堂为单位，组织了一万多个蔬菜专业队，并且发动群众，大搞群众运动，大抓秋菜生产。
    各地在大抓秋菜生产中，合理安排了商品蔬菜生产。长兴、安吉、嘉兴、海宁、德清等六县已建立了六个一千亩以上的商品蔬菜基地。衢县、江山、建德等县对有关工矿所在地的重点公社，都确定了一个公社党委副书记或社主任专门负责蔬菜生产。现在，江山、建德两县已建立生产商品性蔬菜的专业队一百一十三个，种下蔬菜六千九百五十多亩。此外，各地还积极扩大特种蔬菜的生产。嘉兴地区名菜——大头菜产地吴兴县南浔公社，今年大头菜种植的面积比去年扩大一倍。宁波地区的雪里蕻，种植面积也比往年有所增加。各地还做到边种边培育，确保秋菜正常生长。
    本报上海17日电　到8月底止，上海市各县食堂已种菜十五万亩。最近郊区各县根据中共上海市委的指示，进一步加强了对食堂种菜工作的领导，从公社到生产小队普遍建立了领导食堂蔬菜生产的组织，采取措施，做到土地、劳力、品种、产量四落实。中共青浦县委组织了以食堂种菜为中心的两次全县大检查。到8月底为止，这个县的食堂已种好蔬菜一万六千九百多亩，平均每人七厘。许多基层干部也认真踏实地大抓食堂蔬菜生产。奉贤县四团公社小荡生产队的党支部副书记在第九小队工作时，几次同小队干部研究社员种菜吃菜问题，并帮助总结经验。现在这个小队的社员每天可吃到足够的新鲜蔬菜，并已储藏了几千斤菜干。
    为了保证食堂种足种好蔬菜，上海郊区各地在不占用大田面积的原则下，充分利用“四旁”“十边”，扩大蔬菜播种面积，保证每人有六厘菜地。松江县古松公社民华生产队，发动群众“见缝插针”，在零星土地种蔬菜，平均每个社员有近九厘菜地。有些生产队和小队，还大搞套种、间种，千方百计提高土地利用率。金山县干巷公社红光生产队，根据季节、土壤等自然条件，把蔬菜分批轮种，做到一熟接一熟，全年可轮作五熟。因而这个队十九个食堂的社员平均每人每天可吃到两斤多蔬菜，而且还储藏了许多洋山芋、洋葱、瓜干、菜干等。
    本报成都17日电　成都市委最近从市郊商品蔬菜地中，划出一部分土地由一些较大的工厂、企业、机关、大学以及城市人民公社，和农村人民公社共同经营，充分调动城市人民大办农业的积极性，帮助这些工厂机关建立自给性的蔬菜生产基地。
    城乡结合全民种菜这一办法一经提出，立即得到了城区广大职工群众和城市人民公社的热烈拥护，各单位很快行动起来，掀起了大种蔬菜高潮。目前，全市各单位投入蔬菜秋播的劳动力，平均每天有六、七万人之多。二万多个城市人民公社社员，也和农民并肩生产，展开了突击种菜运动。为了保证蔬菜用肥需要，许多单位的职工，还积极利用工余时间大力开展了积肥工作。
    成都市在划拨菜地给各单位时，是本着加强领导，全面规划，统一安排的原则，在不改变公社体制和建制的情况下进行的。种菜各单位都参与公社的领导，参加规划，并支援劳动力和肥料。
    实行从郊区划拨出部分商品蔬菜地，由城市一些机关单位和人民公社共同经营的办法，所收到的效果是多方面的。第一，城市各单位和城市人民公社和郊区公社共同经营蔬菜以后，他们就不仅是蔬菜的消费者，而且成为蔬菜的直接生产者，使城区人民不仅关心蔬菜的供应，而且关心蔬菜的生产。第二，划拨菜地后，城区的机关单位可以经常地或固定地调配更多的劳力，加强蔬菜生产战线，可以更好地精耕细作，把菜地种得更好，增产更多的蔬菜。第三，实行城乡结合的办法，可以使蔬菜的生产、分配和消费，统一在机关企业以内，大大减少中间的环节。第四，有利于密切城市和乡村，工业和农业之间的联系，农业生产得到城市更直接更有力的支援，有利于实现农业的技术改造。第五，城市一些机关单位和公社划有了固定的劳动基地，就能够使城市人民参加劳动更经常。（附图片）
