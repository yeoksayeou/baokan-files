Xinhua News Agency, 5th - Southwest African National Union Chairman Kozonguizi, who is currently visiting China, said here today that the movement of African peoples to fight for national liberation has good prospects. "There is no doubt that in the near future, the entire Africa will be liberated."

He also pointed out that people must be vigilant against US imperialism using the guise of "aid" to carry out economic plunder of newly independent African countries in order to achieve its goal of permanently enslaving the African people. He said that a resolute struggle must be waged against the war policies and aggressive policies of imperialism. Not only African countries, but all anti-imperialist forces in the world should unite to oppose imperialist aggression.

These remarks were made by Kozonguizi at a press conference he held here today for Chinese and foreign journalists.

He also condemned the imperialist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France for consistently supporting the Union of South Africa in the United Nations to obstruct the Southwest African people from achieving independence and freedom. He said that the United States, Britain, and other countries claim that they are defenders of human rights and freedom, but I have visited the United States, Britain, and other countries and found that the governments of these countries are the core of imperialism. In order to protect their investments and economic interests, they have been supporting the Union of South Africa in obstructing our independence.

Kozonguizi expressed his disbelief that the United Nations, controlled by the United States, Britain, France, and other countries, can take any effective measures for the independence demands of the Southwest African people at present. He said, "We will promote and mobilize our people to seize power and independence."

He strongly condemned US imperialism for supporting France's colonial war in Algeria through the Atlantic Treaty Organization. He pointed out: "Without the support of the United States, France cannot continue its war of aggression against Algeria."

He pointed out, "The greatest danger to world peace is imperialism. We will stand with our friends who oppose imperialism with us. I firmly believe that world peace will only come when imperialism is eliminated."

Kozonguizi condemned the slander of US imperialism that China is an "aggressor." He said: "What I see is the United States establishing military bases and sending fleets around the People's Republic of China." He said that after visiting China, I am convinced that China is a peace-loving country and China will not invade any country. He believes that the Chinese people are working hard to develop production, which is a powerful proof of the Chinese people's love of peace. He said that in China he saw what he wanted to see and hoped to see. He said that China's development in all aspects is very rapid, and production is constantly increasing. The annual increase in steel production exceeds the total increase in previous years. I have visited the People's Commune and I saw that the commune members are living happily. He said: "What impressed me the most is the labor spirit of the Chinese people. Everyone is thinking about how to work and work better. I have seen many large buildings completed in only eight to ten months. This is the embodiment of the labor spirit of the Chinese people. This made me realize that to build a country, money is not the main thing, but the labor spirit of the people is more valuable."

    西南非洲民族联盟主席科章吉济发表谈话
    非洲民族解放运动有着良好前景
    必须警惕美帝国主义利用“援助”幌子企图永远掠夺和奴役非洲人民
    新华社5日讯　正在我国访问的西南非洲民族联盟主席科章吉济今天在这里说，非洲各国人民争取民族解放的运动有着良好的前景。“毫无疑问，在不久将来，整个非洲都将得到解放。”
    他还指出，人们必须警惕美帝国主义利用“援助”的幌子对非洲在政治上新独立的国家进行经济掠夺来达到它永远奴役非洲人民的目的。他说，对帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策必须进行坚决的斗争。不仅是非洲的国家，而且是世界上一切反对帝国主义的力量应该团结起来，反对帝国主义的侵略。
    这些话是科章吉济在他今天举行的中外记者招待会上说的。
    他还谴责美、英、法等帝国主义国家一直在联合国中支持南非联邦阻挠西南非洲人民取得独立和自由。他说，美、英等国家口口声声说他们是人权和自由的维护者，但是我曾经访问过美英等国家，并且发现正是这些国家的政府是帝国主义的核心。它们为了维护自己的投资和经济利益，一直在支持阻挠我们独立的南非联邦。
    科章吉济表示他不相信在美英法等国控制下的联合国在目前能为西南非洲人民的独立要求作出任何有效的措施。他说，“我们将推动和动员我们的人民来获取政权和独立。”
    他强烈谴责美帝国主义通过大西洋公约组织支持法国在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争。他指出：“如果没有美国的支持，法国是不能继续它对阿尔及利亚的侵略战争的。”
    他指出，“世界和平最大的危险是帝国主义。我们将同和我们一起反对帝国主义的朋友们站在一起。我深信，只有消灭了帝国主义，世界和平才会到来”。
    科章吉济谴责了美帝国主义诬蔑中国是“侵略者”的谰言。他说：“我看到的却是美国在中华人民共和国的周围建立了军事基地和开来了舰队”。他说，在访问中国以后，我深信中国是爱好和平的国家，中国不会去侵略任何国家。他认为中国人民正在努力发展生产，这是中国人民爱好和平的有力证明。他说，他在中国看到了他自己想看的和希望看到的东西。他说，中国在各方面的发展都是非常快的，生产量在不断增加。钢铁产量一年的增长数字就超过以前许多年增长的总合。我曾经参观过人民公社，我看到社员们都生活得很愉快。他说：“给我印象最深的，是中国人民的劳动精神，每一个人都在考虑着怎样更好的劳动和工作，我看到许多大建筑物都只用了八个月到十个月就建成了，这就是中国人民劳动精神的体现。这使我体会到，要建设一个国家，金钱不是主要的，更可贵的是人民的劳动精神。”
