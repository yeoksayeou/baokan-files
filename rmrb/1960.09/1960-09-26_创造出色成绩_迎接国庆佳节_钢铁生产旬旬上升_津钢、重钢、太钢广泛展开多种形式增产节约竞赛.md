Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 25th: Tianjin's iron and steel industry workers, in the production increase and frugality movement centered on grain and steel, are extensively and deeply carrying out various forms of socialist competition, promoting the vigorous development of steel production and increasing production every ten days. In the past few days, almost all four steel plants in the city and other steelmaking units have created new production records almost every day. The output of Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant in early September increased by 48% compared with the same period in August; the production of No. 2 Steel Plant increased steadily and substantially, and the recent average daily output level has exceeded the new record since the plant was built. In early September, the city's average daily steel production level increased by more than 15% compared with late August, and in mid-September it increased by 7% compared with early September. The qualified rate of steel ingots reached more than 90%.

Since entering September, steel plants and refractory material plants throughout the city, as well as workshops, groups, and individuals, have launched competitions with each other in the form of same-type competitions, counterpart competitions, furnace-contracting competitions, tackling-key-problems competitions, and technical performance competitions. The open-hearth furnaces and iron smelting furnaces of Teams A, B, and C of Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant, etc., are vying with each other, group against group, and person against person, striving to create new achievements and present them to National Day. The Qi Zisheng team of Team B of No. 1 furnace of this factory created a new achievement of smelting a furnace of steel in seven minutes and fifty-six seconds on September 8; then, the Qi Wendong team of Team A learned the operating methods of the Qi Zisheng team and used seven minutes and fourteen seconds to smelt a furnace of qualified steel. By September 9, the workers of the Yu Junyou team of Team C came to the furnace early and, after painstaking research, found a way to further shorten the smelting time. They adopted the new method to operate as soon as they started work, creating a new record of smelting a furnace of steel in seven hours. Through the competition, the average daily output of this factory in the first and middle ten days of September reached the highest level since the plant was built more than 20 years ago. The iron smelting furnaces of Tianjin No. 4 Steel Plant have a relatively short furnace age. This time, the workers strengthened the technical operation of the iron smelting furnaces, summarized and promoted advanced experience, and established and improved the operating systems for feeding, weighing, slagging, maintaining tuyeres, and discharging molten iron, so that the average furnace age increased from more than seventy furnaces to more than three hundred and eighty furnaces. The No. 1 iron smelting furnace in the factory also created the city's highest record of more than four hundred and thirty furnaces.

Under the leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Tianjin's iron and steel workers recently also carried out a "five dragons" same-type large-scale collaboration competition centered on converters and focusing on iron smelting furnaces, including steelmaking furnaces, iron smelting furnaces, steel casting and calcining furnaces, small converters, and small electric furnaces. Competition contracts were signed between furnaces, groups, and individuals, and evaluation dates and inspection methods were specified. In the collaborative competition, the communist style was greatly promoted, and each shift and each type of work rushed to take on difficulties, give way to convenience, create favorable conditions for each other, and actively transmit high-quality and high-yield experience. Zhang Guanghe, the furnace chief of the iron smelting furnace of Class C of Branch No. 1 of Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant, led all the workers in his group to tidy up all the tuyeres ten minutes before the end of work, braving the high temperature, and smelted two more packs of molten iron to leave for the next shift, so that the workers of the next shift created the highest record for shift production of the plant's iron smelting furnace. During the competition, Wang Guisen and Duan Xiaobo of the second shift of the No. 2 Branch of this factory found that the molten iron supply could not keep up because the iron smelting furnace was repairing the slagging eye, which was about to affect converter production; the workers of the Liu Jinqi team of the No. 1 Branch iron smelting furnace immediately sent a pack of molten iron to ensure the normal high yield of the converter.

Chongqing Iron and Steel Company
According to Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 23rd: Under the slogan of "Creating New Achievements and Welcoming National Day," the workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company have launched a "five red" competition since September, focusing on taking measures, breaking through key points, and achieving "red furnace by furnace, red shift by shift, red day by day, red ten days by ten days, and red month by month," enabling steel production to leap to a new level. In the first ten days of September, compared with the same period last month, steel production increased by 22.24%, steel production increased by 2.96%, and quality was further improved; in the middle ten days of September, compared with the first ten days of September, steel production increased by another 7.1%, steel production increased by 19%, and quality also improved.

In order to achieve the "five red," each plant, shift, furnace, and individual competed with each other, striving to be advanced, forming a hot wave. A few days ago, Class 2 and Class 3 of the open-hearth furnace plant were still advanced classes, but before long, Class 1 quickly caught up. The No. 2 Youth Furnace of Converter Plant No. 1 and the Youth Furnace of Converter Plant No. 3 are old rivals in the competition. At the beginning of September, Liang Shuqing, the leader of the Youth Furnace of Converter Plant No. 3, and Pang Yonggui, the rocker, ran to Converter Plant No. 1 during their rest time to "learn" from the No. 2 Youth Furnace, which won the Red Flag Furnace title in August, and immediately organized all the workers in the furnace to study after returning to their plant. In the first five days of September, they won the red flag with a new achievement of exceeding the No. 2 Youth Furnace by 198 tons of steel. But not long after, the workers of the Youth Furnace of Converter Plant No. 3 knocked on gongs and drums to send the red flag back to the No. 2 Youth Furnace of Converter Plant No. 1. It turned out that in the last five days of the first ten days of September, the No. 2 Youth Furnace took the lead again with a new achievement of producing 129 tons more steel than the Youth Furnace of Converter Plant No. 3. Recently, the Youth Furnace of Converter Plant No. 3 took the lead again.

Learning from the advanced when they see it and catching up with the advanced when they see it is one of the distinct characteristics of Chongqing Steel's workers carrying out the competition. Converter Plant No. 3 is a red flag for the company's continuous high production and continuous revolution, and other converter plants immediately set off a competition upsurge of learning from Plant No. 3, catching up with Plant No. 3, and surpassing Plant No. 3. The workers of Converter Plant No. 2 compared their equipment and other conditions with Plant No. 3, and concluded that it was better than Plant No. 3 and should not lag behind Plant No. 3. Therefore, the workers of the whole plant took action to find key points and found that too many empty material lines of the iron smelting furnace affected the high yield of the converter. The plant immediately established a material line command to strengthen the leadership of the material line. All the workers in the plant supported the material line, forming a mass movement to protect the material line. At the same time, the charging team improved labor organization, ensuring the needs of high production of the converter, and the daily steel production level quickly increased by 90%.

The workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company closely integrated the labor competition with solving key production problems to promote sustained high steel production. How to further reduce the sulfur content of pig iron is one of the key production points of the entire company. In order to overcome this key point, steelmaking, ironmaking, and coking plants, as well as raw materials, iron smelting furnaces, smelting, and other sections within the steelmaking plant, carried out a "one-dragon" sulfur attacking competition. They adopted various effective measures and set up a line of defense to restrict the passage of sulfur.

Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company
According to Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 25th: The workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, with the team as the main body, set off a competition upsurge of catching up with each other, promoting the overall surge in production. In the first ten days of September, compared with the same period in August, steel production increased by 36.1%, pig iron increased by 4.2%, and coke increased by 5%; in the middle ten days of September, compared with the first ten days, steel increased by another 3.2%, pig iron increased by 6.2%, and coke increased by 1%. The quality of steel, iron, and coke has been significantly improved, and raw material consumption has generally decreased.

After the competition started, many backward units caught up, and the advanced ones became even more advanced. The No. 7 furnace of the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant has been a high-yield and high-quality red flag furnace in the plant since May this year. After September, the plant launched a competition to learn from No. 7 and catch up with No. 7, and No. 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 furnaces successively caught up with No. 7 furnace. As a result of each furnace catching up with the model furnace, the daily production level of the whole plant rapidly increased by about 20%. The rapid increase in steel production further encouraged the ambition of the workers in the plant to strive for the upper reaches. They issued a competition challenge to the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, which pioneered three-slot steel tapping. The workers of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant immediately responded to the challenge. In the first ten days of September, the production of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant was surpassed by the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant for nine days. The Party Secretary of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, together with veteran workers and technicians, formed a "three-in-one" technical performance group to quickly spread new technologies and attack the smelting time, continuously creating 37 new production records, and steel production again surpassed the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant several times.

The workers in the ironmaking system, such as blast furnaces, coke ovens, transportation, machine repair, and power, also carried out a "one-dragon" competition centered on producing more iron and producing good iron. The competition among the workers in the ironmaking plant was particularly intense. In the first ten days of September, the pig iron production of the No. 2 workshop of the ironmaking plant greatly exceeded that of the No. 1 workshop, taking the lead in the entire company. At the beginning of mid-September, the workers of the No. 1 workshop put forward the bold slogan that the daily output must exceed that of the No. 2 workshop. The total volume of the two blast furnaces in the No. 1 workshop is less than half of the volume of one blast furnace in the No. 2 workshop, and at the same time, the equipment is older and the technical conditions are worse. However, the workers in this workshop were full of ambition. They summarized and promoted the operating experience of the No. 1 Youth Blast Furnace, "good start in the first shift, stable furnace condition in the second shift, and more iron in the third shift," and achieved furnace guarantee shift, shift guarantee day. From September 11 to 15, their average daily production level exceeded that of the No. 2 workshop by 11%; on September 17, they created a historical record of exceeding the plan by 20%, exceeding the same day's production of the No. 2 workshop by 22%. The workers of the large blast furnace in the No. 2 workshop immediately learned the advanced experience of the No. 1 workshop, worked hard, and did solid work. The two workshops caught up with each other and promoted each other.

    创造出色成绩　迎接国庆佳节
　  钢铁生产旬旬上升
    津钢、重钢、太钢广泛展开多种形式增产节约竞赛
　　天津钢铁企业
    新华社天津25日电  天津钢铁工业职工在以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动中，广泛深入地开展多种形式的社会主义竞赛，促进炼钢生产蒸蒸日上、旬旬提高。全市四家钢厂和其他各炼钢单位，最近几天几乎天天都创造了生产新纪录。天津第一钢厂9月上旬的产量比8月同期增长48％；第二钢厂生产稳定地大幅度上升，最近的平均日产水平已超过建厂以来的新纪录。9月上旬，全市钢的平均日产水平比8月下旬提高15％多，中旬又比上旬提高7％，钢锭合格率达到90％以上。
    进入9月份以来，全市各钢厂、耐火材料厂，各个车间、小组和个人，相互展开了同工种赛、对口赛、包炉赛、攻关赛、技术表演赛。天津第一钢厂甲乙丙三班的平炉、化铁炉等各班组，班与班、组与组、人与人你追我赶，争先创造新成绩向国庆节献礼。这个厂的一号炉乙班齐子升小组，9月8日创造了用七点五十六分钟炼一炉钢的新成绩；接着，甲班齐文栋小组学习了齐子升小组的操作方法，更用七点十四分钟炼出一炉合格钢。到9月9日，丙班于俊有小组的工人提早来到炉前，经过苦心钻研，找出进一步缩短熔炼时间的方法，一上班就采用新方法操作，创造了用七小时炼一炉钢的新纪录。通过竞赛，这个厂9月中上旬的平均日产量，达到了建厂二十多年以来的最高水平。天津第四钢厂的化铁炉炉龄较短，这次，职工们加强了化铁炉的技术操作，总结和推行了先进经验，建立和健全了进料、过磅、扒渣、维护风眼、出铁水等操作制度，使炉龄平均由七十多炉提高到三百八十多炉。厂里的一号化铁炉，还创造了四百三十多炉的全市最高纪录。
    在中共天津市委领导下，天津钢铁职工最近还以转炉为中心，以化铁炉为重点，开展了炼钢炉、化铁炉、铸钢锻烧炉、小转炉和小电炉的五条龙同工种大协作竞赛。炉与炉、组与组、人与人之间都签订了竞赛合同，并且规定了评比日期、检查办法。在协作赛中，共产主义风格大大发扬，各班、各工种互相抢困难、让方便，互为对方创造有利条件，主动传送优质高产经验。天津第二钢厂一分厂丙班化铁炉炉长张广和，在下班前十分钟就带领全组工人冒着高温，把全部风眼整理好，并且多炼了两包铁水留给下一班，使下一班的工人创造了全厂化铁炉班产最高纪录。这个厂的二分厂中班王桂森和段小波小组在竞赛过程中，因化铁炉修理扒渣眼，铁水供应不上，眼看就要影响转炉生产；一分厂化铁炉刘金起小组的工人知道以后，立即把一包铁水送过去，保证了转炉的正常高产。
　　重庆钢铁公司
    据新华社重庆23日  电重庆钢铁公司职工在“创造新成绩，迎接国庆节”的口号下，9月以来展开了一个大抓措施，大破关键，实现炉炉红、班班红、日日红、旬旬红、月月红的“五红”竞赛，使钢铁生产跃进到了一个新的水平。9月上旬比上月同期，钢的产量增长22.24％，钢材增长2.96％，质量进一步提高；9月中旬比9月上旬，钢的产量又增长7.1％，钢材增长19％，质量也有提高。
    为了达到“五红”，各厂班与班、炉与炉、个人与个人之间，你追我赶，力争先进，形成了一股热潮。平炉厂二班和三班几天前还是先进班，为时不久，一班却又很快赶到前面去了。转炉一厂二号青年炉和转炉三厂青年炉是竞赛的老对手。9月初，转炉三厂青年炉班长梁数清和摇炉工庞永贵利用休息时间跑到转炉一厂，向8月份获得红旗炉称号的二号青年炉“取经”，回本厂后立即组织全炉工人学习。9月头五天，他们以超过二号青年炉一百九十八吨钢的新成绩夺取了红旗。但是过了不久，转炉三厂青年炉的工人又敲着锣鼓把红旗送回了转炉一厂二号青年炉。原来，在9月上旬的后五天，二号青年炉又以比转炉三厂青年炉多产一百二十九吨钢的新成绩领了先。最近，转炉三厂的青年炉又领了先。
    见先进就学，见先进就赶，是重钢职工开展竞赛的鲜明特点之一。转炉三厂是全公司持续高产不断革命的一面红旗，其他几个转炉厂立即掀起学三厂、赶三厂、超三厂的竞赛热潮。转炉二厂职工拿自己的设备等条件同三厂比较，结论是比三厂好，不应该落在三厂的后面。于是，全厂职工动手寻找关键，发现化铁炉空料线过多影响了转炉高产。厂里立即成立料线指挥部，加强对料线的领导。全厂职工支援料线，形成人人保料线的群众运动。同时加料班改进劳动组织，保证了转炉高产需要，钢的日产水平很快提高90％。
    重庆钢铁公司职工把劳动竞赛与解决生产关键密切结合起来，推动钢铁持续高产。如何进一步降低生铁含硫量，是全公司的生产关键之一。为了攻克这个关键，炼钢、炼铁、炼焦各厂，以及炼钢厂内的原料、化铁炉、冶炼等各工段，都开展了一条龙攻硫竞赛。他们采取各种有效措施，环环设置了限制硫磺过关的防线。
　　太原钢铁公司
    据新华社太原25日电　太原钢铁公司职工以班组为主掀起你追我赶的竞赛热潮，促进生产全面高涨。9月上旬和8月同期比，钢产量提高36.1％，生铁提高4.2％，焦炭提高5％；9月中旬和上旬比，钢又提高3.2％，生铁提高6.2％，焦炭提高1％。钢、铁、焦的质量显著提高，原料消耗普遍下降。
    竞赛展开以后，许多后进的单位赶了上来，先进的也变得更先进了。第二炼钢厂的七号炉从今年5月起一直是全厂高产优质的红旗炉，9月以后全厂展开了学七号赶七号的竞赛，一、三、五、八号和十号炉先后赶上了七号炉。各炉追赶标兵炉的结果，使全厂的日产水平迅速增长20％左右。钢产量的猛烈增长，更加鼓舞了全厂职工力争上游的雄心。他们向首创三槽出钢的第一炼钢厂发出了竞赛挑战书。第一炼钢厂工人立即应战。在9月上旬，第一炼钢厂的生产有九天被第二炼钢厂超过。第一炼钢厂的党委书记同老工人和技术人员组成了“三结合”技术表演团，迅速传播新技术，猛攻冶炼时间关，连续创造了三十七次生产新纪录，钢产量又几度赶过了第二炼钢厂。
    炼铁系统的高炉、焦炉、运输、机修和动力等方面的职工，也以多炼铁、炼好铁为中心，开展了“一条龙”竞赛。炼铁厂职工的竞赛特别热烈。9月上旬，炼铁厂二车间的生铁产量大大超过了一车间，在全公司居于领先地位。中旬一开始，一车间职工提出了日产定要超过二车间的豪迈口号。一车间的两个高炉总容积还不到二车间一个高炉容积的一半，同时设备较旧，技术条件也差。但是，这个车间的职工满怀雄心壮志，他们总结推广了一号青年高炉“头班开门红，二班稳炉况，三班多出铁”的操作经验，做到了以炉保班、以班保日。9月11日到15日，他们的平均日产水平超过二车间11％；到17日，又创日产超计划20％的历史最高纪录，超过二车间同日产量22％。二车间大型高炉的职工立即学习了一车间的先进经验，苦干、实干。两个车间你追我赶，互相促进。
