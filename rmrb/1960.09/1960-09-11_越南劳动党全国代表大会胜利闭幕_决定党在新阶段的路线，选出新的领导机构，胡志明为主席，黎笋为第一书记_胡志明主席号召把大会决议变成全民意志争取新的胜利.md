    Today, the congress also issued a resolution on changing the founding date of the Workers' Party from January 6 to February 3.

    The resolution said that, according to historical documents and materials, the merger meeting to establish the Party (referring to the merger of the Revolutionary Youth League, the New Vietnam Party, and the Vietnam Communist Party into the Indochinese Communist Party) was held on February 3, 1930, according to the Gregorian calendar, which is January 5 according to the lunar calendar. Therefore, it is stipulated that February 3 of the Gregorian calendar each year will be the anniversary of the founding of the Party.

    Chairman Ho Chi Minh delivered the closing speech at the meeting. First, on behalf of the Party Congress and 500,000 party members, he expressed his warm gratitude to the fraternal parties and thanked the people of the whole country who actively launched labor competitions and presented gifts to the congress, as well as the staff who served the congress.

    Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: "The great achievements of this Party Congress are: the determination of the general line of the transitional period for the North to transition to socialism and the line of struggle to realize the peaceful reunification of the country. The organizational line of the Party was determined to enhance the Party's combat effectiveness and strengthen the Party's leadership in the new revolutionary stage. The new Central Committee of our Party has been elected."

    He said: "The Second Party Congress guided (Vietnam) to victory in the war of resistance. It is firmly believed that the Third Party Congress will be a new dawn and a source of new strength for the entire Party and the entire people to victoriously build socialism in the North and to strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland."

    He also said: "At present, we still have many difficulties. But we will definitely overcome all difficulties. Because we have the great Marxism-Leninism guiding the way. Because we have the powerful socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union, the solidarity of more than eighty fraternal parties and 35 million comrades, and the assistance and support of the world's great national independence, peace, and democracy forces. Because all our cadres and party members are closely united and determined to turn the resolutions of the congress into the will of the entire people to strive for new victories."

    Chairman Ho Chi Minh, on behalf of the Party Congress, called on the compatriots of the whole country to forge ahead bravely, and everyone should strive to become an advanced worker and an advanced soldier.

    He said: "Fifteen years ago, our Party had only 5,000 members and was in extremely difficult conditions, but the Party led the August Revolution to victory. Today, our Party has more than 500,000 members and has many favorable conditions. Therefore, the Party will certainly be able to lead the socialist revolution to success and realize the unification of the country."

    Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: "Our entire Party and the entire people are closely united into a powerful whole. We want to create. We want to build. We want to move forward. No force can stop us from advancing from victory to victory."

    Finally, Chairman Ho Chi Minh shouted:

    Long live peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam!

    Long live the unity of all countries in the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union!

    Long live the unity of all communist and workers' parties in the world!

    Long live invincible Marxism-Leninism!

    Long live the Vietnam Workers' Party!

    When he shouted the slogans, the entire audience stood up again, and applause and cheers continued for a long time. The entire venue was filled with a warm, lively, and united atmosphere.
