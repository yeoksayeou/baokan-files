Strengthen Washing and Screening to Improve Clean Coal Recovery Rate

The coal washing workers of Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, vigorously strengthened the washing and screening of raw coal, and tried every means to improve the recovery rate of clean coal. From September 1st to 12th, the amount of clean coal recovered by flotation from slime coal alone increased by more than 3,700 tons compared with the same period in August, and the quality was all up to standard. This measure of recovering clean coal can not only provide about 4% of coking coal for the company, but also save transportation costs and reduce ironmaking costs.

Using Mineral Powder to Produce Sintered Ore

Iron and steel plants in Anhui Province are making full use of mineral powder, coke breeze, and limestone powder to produce sintered ore on a large scale, in order to meet the needs of the continuous leap forward in ironmaking production. All the "small-scale foreign groups" enterprises in the province have established professional sintering teams and set up sintering workshops, so that the daily output of sintered ore in the province has been increasing steadily. Using "three powders" to produce sintered ore not only makes full use of national resources, but also improves the utilization coefficient and production quality of blast furnaces, and reduces the cost of pig iron.

Vigorously Carry Out Technical Transformation of Mine Transportation

The mining and excavation industry departments in Sichuan Province are vigorously carrying out the "New Five-izations" movement of linkage, automation, double-tracking, train-ization, and ball bearing-ization of underground and surface transportation. A number of mines in Mianyang, Leshan, Neijiang, Yibin, Dazhou and other regions, which are key coal and iron producing areas in the province, have realized or partially realized the "New Five-izations," so that ore and coking coal are transported from the production area to the blast furnace in one go, greatly improving transportation efficiency and ensuring that the blast furnace is well fed and has a surplus.

Use Blasting Methods to Mine More Ore

Linru County, Henan Province, uses blasting methods to mine ore, firing more than 500 shots per month, producing more than 2,000 tons of ore, ensuring that the county's small blast furnaces are well fed and have a surplus, so that the daily output of iron has increased sharply from more than 200 tons in early July to more than 400 tons now.

Basic Self-Sufficiency in Freight Car Parts

Qiqihar Rolling Stock Plant has adopted a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and a method of supporting the factory by the factory, vigorously developing comprehensive utilization of raw materials and diversified operations, taking the supporting of freight car production as the key link, and set up 53 satellite factories. From the beginning of last year to August of this year, it has produced more than 200 kinds of products, and most of the parts for freight cars have been self-sufficient, creating favorable conditions for increasing the production of freight cars.

    要闻快报
    加强洗选提高精煤回收率
    北京石景山钢铁公司洗煤工人，在增产节约运动中，大力加强原煤洗选，千方百计提高精煤的回收率，九月一日至十二日，仅从泥煤中浮选回收的精煤，就比八月同期增加了三千七百多吨，质量全部合格。这项回收精煤的措施，不仅可以为这个公司提供百分之四左右的炼焦用煤，而且还可以节省运输费用，降低炼铁成本。
    用矿粉等生产烧结矿
    安徽省各钢铁厂充分利用矿粉、焦末和石灰石粉大搞烧结矿，以适应炼铁生产持续跃进的需要。全省各个钢铁“小洋群”企业成立了专业烧结队，设置了烧结车间，使全省烧结矿日产量步步提高。利用“三粉”生产烧结矿，不仅充分利用了国家资源，而且提高了高炉利用系数和生产质量，降低了生铁成本。
    大搞矿山运输技术改造
    四川省采掘工业部门大搞井下和地面运输联动化、自动化、双轨化、列车化和滚珠轴承化的“新五化”运动。全省煤铁重点产地的绵阳、乐山、内江、宜宾、达县等专区，已有一批矿山实现或部分实现了“新五化”，使矿石、煤焦从产区到高炉，一次运到底，运输效率大大提高，保证了高炉吃饱有余。
    用爆破方法多采矿石
    河南省临汝县用爆破法采矿，每月放炮五百多响，产矿石二千多吨，保证了全县小高炉吃饱有余，使铁的日产量从七月初的二百多吨，猛增到现在的四百多吨。
    货车配件基本自给
    齐齐哈尔车辆厂采取土洋结合，以厂养厂的方法，大搞原材料综合利用、多种经营，以货车生产配套为纲，办起五十三个卫星工厂。从去年年初到今年八月，已生产出二百多种产品，货车的配件，绝大部分都已自给，为增产货车创造了有利条件。
