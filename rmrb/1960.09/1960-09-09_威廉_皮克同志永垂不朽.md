Eternal Glory to Comrade Wilhelm Pieck
Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, the beloved leader of the German people, the closest friend of the Chinese people, and President of the German Democratic Republic, unfortunately passed away on September 7th! The death of Comrade Pieck is not only a great loss to the working people of Germany, but also a great loss to the working people of the world. The 650 million Chinese people, with incomparable sorrow, join the German people and progressive people around the world in mourning our close friend and express our deep condolences to the German people.

Comrade Wilhelm Pieck was a loyal student of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, an outstanding activist in the German workers' movement and the international communist movement, and one of the founders and leaders of the German Communist Party and the Socialist Unity Party. Comrade Pieck dedicated his life to the cause of liberation of the German working class and the German people. The glorious road Comrade Pieck traveled is the road for the German working class and the German people to strive for the victory of the workers' cause and the socialist cause. The Chinese people have always deeply admired and respected Comrade Pieck, the most outstanding son of the German working class and the old fighter of the international communist movement.

Comrade Pieck was born into a working-class family, and from his youth, he began his activities to liberate the German working class. After joining the revolutionary workers' movement in 1894 and the German Social Democratic Party in the following year, he actively led the German workers' strike movement. Before and during the First World War, he, together with Liebknecht, Luxemburg, and Zetkin, waged a resolute struggle to defend Marxism against right-wing opportunism within the Social Democratic Party at that time. During the German Revolution of 1918, which was triggered by the influence of the great Russian October Socialist Revolution, Comrade Pieck carried out outstanding activities in the work of creating the German Communist Party. Later, Comrade Pieck participated in the leadership of the Communist International and served as a member and secretary of the Executive Committee of the Communist International in 1928. During the period of Hitler's rule in Germany and the Second World War, Comrade Pieck waged a heroic struggle to overthrow Hitler's bloody rule and oppose the fascist war of aggression, and to safeguard the interests of the German people and the progressive people of the world.

After the Soviet army crushed Hitler's offensive, Comrade Pieck gathered the members of the German Communist Party and began the arduous post-war reconstruction work on the ruins of the war. In 1946, the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party in eastern Germany carried out a historic merger to form the German Socialist Unity Party. Comrade Pieck did a great deal of work for the unification of the two parties. After the formation of the Socialist Unity Party, Comrade Pieck and Grotewohl jointly served as chairmen of the party. On October 7, 1949, the first state in German history where the working people were masters of their own affairs—the German Democratic Republic—was founded, and Comrade Pieck was honorably elected as president. In the post-war years, Comrade Pieck carried out arduous work to establish a socialist state of workers and peasants, to lead the German Democratic Republic onto the road of building socialism, and to strive for the establishment of a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, and made outstanding contributions to the cause of world peace and socialism.

During the difficult years of the Chinese people's liberation struggle, Comrade Pieck showed cordial concern for the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic in the same year and month, Comrade Pieck has made unremitting efforts to strengthen the fraternal friendship between our two peoples. Today, as our people mourn this close friend, we must transform our grief into strength, and together with the fraternal people of the German Democratic Republic, continue to strive to further strengthen socialist construction, consolidate and develop the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and German peoples, and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    威廉·皮克同志永垂不朽
    德国人民敬爱的领袖、中国人民最亲密的朋友、德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克同志，不幸于9月7日与世长辞！皮克同志的逝世，不仅是德意志劳动人民的重大损失，而且是全世界劳动人民的重大损失。六亿五千万中国人民以无比悲痛的心情，同德意志人民和全世界进步人类一起，悼念我们的亲密朋友，并且向德意志人民表示深切的哀悼。
    威廉·皮克同志是马克思、恩格斯、列宁的忠实学生，是德国工人运动和国际共产主义运动的杰出活动家，是德国共产党和统一社会党的缔造者和领导者之一。皮克同志一生献身于德国工人阶级和德国人民的解放事业。皮克同志所走过的光荣的道路，就是德国工人阶级和德国人民争取工人阶级事业、社会主义事业胜利的道路。中国人民对于德国工人阶级和德国人民最优秀的儿子、国际共产主义运动的老战士——皮克同志一向深深地景仰和尊敬。
    皮克同志出身于工人的家庭，从青年时代起，他就开始了为德国工人阶级谋取解放的活动。他在1894年参加革命的工人运动并在第二年参加德国社会民主党以后，积极地领导了德国工人的罢工运动。在第一次世界大战以前和战争期间，他曾经同李卜克内西、卢森堡和蔡特金一起，为了保卫马克思主义，同当时的社会民主党内的右倾机会主义进行了坚决的斗争。在由伟大的俄国十月社会主义革命的影响而掀起的1918年的德国革命中，在创建德国共产党的工作中，皮克同志曾经进行了卓越的活动。以后，皮克同志参加了共产国际的领导工作，1928年担任共产国际执行委员会委员和书记。在希特勒统治德国时期和第二次世界大战时期，皮克同志为推翻希特勒的血腥统治和反对法西斯侵略战争，为维护德国人民和全世界进步人类的利益而进行了英勇的斗争。
    在苏军粉碎希特勒的进攻以后，皮克同志集合了德国共产党的党员，在战争的废墟上着手进行艰苦的战后重建工作。1946年德国东部的共产党和社会民主党实行了具有历史意义的合并，组成了德国统一社会党，皮克同志为这两个党的统一进行了巨大的工作。统一社会党组成后，皮克同志和格罗提渥共同担任党的主席。1949年10月7日，德国历史上第一个劳动人民当家作主的国家——德意志民主共和国成立，皮克同志荣任总统。皮克同志在战后的年代里，为建立一个社会主义的工农国家，使德意志民主共和国走上建设社会主义的道路，为争取建立一个统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的德国进行了艰巨的工作，对争取世界和平和社会主义的事业作出了卓越的贡献。
    在中国人民进行解放斗争的艰苦年代里，皮克同志就对中国人民的革命事业寄予亲切的关怀。自从中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国同年同月诞生以来，皮克同志为加强我们两国人民的兄弟友谊进行了不懈的努力。今天，当我国人民悼念这位亲密朋友的时候，我们一定把悲痛化为力量，同兄弟般的德意志民主共和国人民一起，为进一步加强社会主义建设、巩固和发展中德两国人民之间的兄弟友谊和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结而继续努力。
