On Obedience
		Gong Tongwen

	Listening to the Party, listening to the masses, are two fundamental principles, which means believing in the Party and believing in the masses. It sounds easy, but it’s not easy to do, though it’s certainly not impossible. Why is it that some people, though they say they “listen to the Party, listen to the masses,” discount this in practice, or use listening to the Party as a shield for commandism, or use listening to the masses as a shield for not implementing the Party's resolutions? Putting “listening to the Party” and “listening to the masses” in opposition to each other inevitably results in neither listening to the Party nor listening to the masses. Why is it that many comrades can say it and do it? Comrade Zhao Yiyue is an example.
	Zhao Yiyue is the Party branch secretary and team leader of the Star No. 5 Team in Xijiadian Commune, Jun County. He was once seen by individual leading cadres as a "disobedient team leader." After an in-depth investigation and understanding by the County Party Committee, it turned out that he was a good comrade who was good at listening. He listens to the Party and also listens to the masses, and he is good at unifying the two.
	When individual leading cadres demanded that the specifications for close planting be "uniform," he, based on different conditions such as paddy fields, riverbank fields, and hillside fields, used different densities, truly achieving adapting to local conditions and implementing rational close planting. Generally speaking, close planting is an important measure for increasing production. Here, whether Lao Zhao is obedient depends on whether he promotes close planting, and especially on whether he truly implements rational close planting. Only rational close planting can ensure increased production. Rational close planting is what the Party strongly advocates and what the masses are happy to accept. Lao Zhao adhered to rational close planting and ensured increased production, which shows that he truly listens to the Party and listens to the masses. But that "individual leading cadre" pursued "uniform" specifications, only caring about "good looks," only caring about "convenience," and not caring about whether production increased or not. He himself did not listen to the Party or the masses, but he reversed right and wrong and pinned a "disobedient" label on Lao Zhao!
	When individual leading cadres demanded "uniformity" for continuous cropping, Lao Zhao, based on soil quality and stubble, determined what crops to plant on each plot. Generally speaking, planting according to local conditions and crop rotation are also important measures for increasing production. Here, whether Lao Zhao is obedient depends on whether he plants according to local conditions, and especially on whether he (as a production team leader) specifically helps each team determine the planting plan for each plot. Only planting according to local conditions can ensure increased production. Planting according to local conditions is what the Party strongly advocates and what the masses are happy to accept. Lao Zhao adhered to planting according to local conditions and ensured increased production, which shows that he truly listens to the Party and listens to the masses. But that "individual leading cadre" pursued "uniform" specifications, only caring about "good looks," only caring about "convenience," and not caring about whether production increased or not. He himself did not listen to the Party or the masses, but he reversed right and wrong and pinned a "disobedient" label on Lao Zhao!
	When individual leading cadres demanded "leaving no land uncultivated" in order to plant more and harvest more, Lao Zhao, in response to the characteristics of the mountainous area with its scarce labor and poor soil quality, adopted the methods of reclamation, expanding the area, and soil improvement and crop rotation to achieve the goal of planting more and harvesting more. Generally speaking, planting more and harvesting more is an important measure for increasing production. Here, whether Lao Zhao is obedient depends on how he achieves the goal of planting more and harvesting more based on the local characteristics. In Lao Zhao's area, reclamation and soil improvement go hand in hand to achieve the goal of planting more and harvesting more, while the simple demand for "leaving no land uncultivated" may not necessarily result in planting more and harvesting more. Reclamation and soil improvement are what the Party strongly advocates and what the masses are happy to accept. Lao Zhao adhered to reclamation and soil improvement and ensured increased production, which shows that he truly listens to the Party and listens to the masses. But that "individual leading cadre" pursued "leaving no land uncultivated," only caring about "good looks," only caring about "convenience," and not caring about whether production increased or not. He himself did not listen to the Party or the masses, but he reversed right and wrong and pinned a "disobedient" label on Lao Zhao!
	Whether it is Lao Zhao who is "disobedient" or that "individual leading cadre" who is not listening is clear at a glance, and it is something that leading comrades should think deeply about.
	From the above examples, we can see that it is successful experience for Lao Zhao, while it is a profound lesson for that "individual leading cadre."
	Agricultural production is a science. We must be honest in the face of science, and we must combine the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and dare to act with the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts. Comrade Zhao Yiyue has done a very good job in this regard. He has long borne the stigma of "disobedience," adhered to the revolutionary spirit, and adhered to the scientific spirit. He has thoroughly understood the essence of rational close planting, planting according to local conditions, crop rotation, reclamation and soil improvement, and planting more and harvesting more. He is very familiar with agricultural production, and he is very familiar with the demands of the masses, so he has true knowledge and insight, and he dares to uphold the truth. His style of daring to think, daring to act, and seeking truth from facts is a concrete manifestation of listening to the Party and listening to the masses. Compared with Zhao Yiyue, that "individual leading cadre" not only did not dare to think, dare to act, or dare to seek truth from facts, but also adopted a simple and crude attitude towards the science of agricultural production; no matter what he did, he only allowed one "model," the so-called "uniformity." In this way, he wanted to "save trouble" for himself, but caused great trouble for the cadres and commune members below. He thought it was very "good-looking," but if Lao Zhao listened to him, then production would definitely be very ugly. "Good-looking" and "ugly" are not only in form, but mainly in content. As far as agricultural production is concerned, increased production is good-looking. If there is no increased production, what is there to be good-looking about? As a leading cadre, he himself does not listen to the Party or the masses, but instead puts a big "disobedient" label on the head of a good comrade who is good at listening. This is very disgraceful.
	As lower-level cadres, it is necessary to resolutely implement the instructions from above. If they think that they can discard the instructions from above and act in their own way, that is an act of being unorganized and undisciplined. Then, can we say that Lao Zhao's approach of adhering to the revolutionary spirit and adhering to the scientific spirit is an act of being unorganized and undisciplined? We cannot say that. In fact, Lao Zhao's approach is completely in line with the Party's policies and the demands of the masses. As far as the responsibility of the leadership is concerned, the problem lies in the fact that that "individual leading cadre" violated the Party's policies and the demands of the masses. It can be said that he was practicing subjectivism and commandism on top of Lao Zhao. As far as Lao Zhao himself is concerned, he should, on the one hand, actively report the situation and opinions to the higher authorities, and on the other hand, act in accordance with the Party's policies and the demands of the masses.
	The Jun County Party Committee's handling of this "disobedient team leader" was completely correct. In retrospect, due to the promotion of Zhao Yiyue's experience, a mass movement of reclaiming land, improving soil, planting more, and harvesting more was launched throughout the county, achieving great results. The origin of this achievement can also be attributed to the Jun County Party Committee's ability to listen to the Party, listen to the masses, and be good at combining the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and dare to act with the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts. It can also be said that the Jun County Party Committee is good at identifying cadres.
	Do not just repeat "listening to the Party, listening to the masses" like "chanting scriptures," but truly and strictly act in accordance with the Party's policies and the demands of the masses in practice. Treat the Party's policies and the demands of the masses like Zhao Yiyue, and never treat the Party's policies and the demands of the masses like that "individual leading cadre."
	We have tens of thousands of Zhao Yiyues in our province, and also a small number of "individual leading cadres." Therefore, we must be good at promoting Zhao Yiyue's experience like the Jun County Party Committee, and seriously promote Zhao Yiyue's experience. We must resolutely open fire on the subjectivist and commandist style of that "individual leading cadre" and eliminate that bad style completely!

    论听话	龚同文
    听党的话，听群众的话，也就是相信党，相信群众，这是两条最根本的原理。说起来容易，做起来不容易，当然也不难。说容易吧，为什么有的人口里也说要“听党的话，听群众的话”，而在做的当中打了折扣，或者是把听党的话作为命令主义的护身符，或者是把听群众的话作为不执行党的决议的挡箭牌？把“听党的话”和“听群众的话”对立起来，其结果，必然是既没有听党的话，也没有听群众的话。说难吧，为什么很多同志说得到做得到呢？赵以约同志是一个例子。
    赵以约，均县习家店公社明星五队的支部书记兼队长，曾经被个别领导干部看成“不听话的队长”，经过县委深入调查了解，原来他是一个善于听话的好同志。他听党的话，又听群众的话，并且善于把两者统一起来。
    当个别领导干部要求密植的规格“整齐划一”的时候，他却根据泡水田、河岸田、山坡田等不同情况，分别不同的密度，真正做到了因地制宜，合理密植。要讲大道理，密植，是一项重要的增产措施。在这里，看老赵是不是听话，就看他是不是推行密植，特别要看他是不是真正执行了合理密植。只有合理密植，才能确保增产。合理密植是党所极力提倡的，也是群众所乐于接受的。老赵坚持了合理密植，保证了增产，这说明他真正是听党的话，听群众的话的。而那位“个别领导干部”却追求“整齐划一”的所谓规格，只顾“好看”，只顾“省事”，不管增产不增产，是他自己不听党的话，也不听群众的话，他却颠倒是非给老赵扣了一顶“不听话”的帽子！
    当个别领导干部对于作物连片要求“一律化”的时候，老赵却根据土质和茬口，逐块确定种植什么作物。讲大道理，因地种植，轮作换茬，也是一项重要的增产措施。在这里，看老赵是不是听话，就看他是不是因地种植，特别要看他（作为一个生产队长来说）是不是具体地帮助各小队逐块确定种植计划。只有因地种植，才能确保增产。因地种植是党所极力提倡的，也是群众乐于接受的。老赵坚持了因地种植，保证了增产，这说明他真正是听党的话，听群众的话的。而那位“个别领导干部”却追求“一律化”的规格，只顾“好看”，只顾“省事”，不管增产不增产，是他自己不听党的话，也不听群众的话，他却颠倒是非给老赵扣了一顶“不听话”的帽子！
    当个别领导干部为了多种多收而要求“寸土不留”的时候，老赵却针对山区劳力少、土质坏的特点，采取了开荒，扩大面积，和炕地、轮作的办法，达到多种多收的目的。讲大道理，多种多收是重要的增产措施。在这里，看老赵是不是听话，就看他如何根据本地的特点达到多种多收的目的。在老赵所在的那个地区，开荒和炕地并举，才能做到多种多收，而那种简单地要求“寸土不留”的做法，多种未必多收。开荒、炕地，是党所极力提倡的，也是群众乐于接受的。老赵坚持了开荒、炕地，保证了增产，这说明他是真正听党的话，听群众的话的。而那位“个别领导干部”却追求“寸土不留”，只顾“好看”，只顾“省事”，不管增产不增产，是他自己不听党的话，也不听群众的话，他却颠倒是非给老赵扣了一顶“不听话”的帽子！
    到底是老赵“不听话”，还是那位“个别领导干部”自己不听话，这是一眼就看得明明白白的事情，也是值得领导同志深思的事情。
    从上面的例子可以看到，对于老赵是成功的经验，而对于那位“个别领导干部”则是深刻的教训。
    农业生产是一门科学。在科学面前要老老实实，要把敢想敢干的革命精神和实事求是的科学精神结合起来。赵以约同志在这方面做得很出色。他长期背着“不听话”的恶名，坚持革命精神，坚持科学精神。他把合理密植，因地种植，轮作换茬，开荒炕地，多种多收这些增产措施的底摸透了，他对农业生产很熟悉，他对群众的要求很熟悉，因而他才有真知灼见，他才敢于坚持真理。他的这种敢想敢干和实事求是的作风，是听党的话，听群众的话的具体表现。与赵以约比较起来，那位“个别领导干部”不仅不敢想，不敢干，不敢实事求是，而且采取了简单粗暴的态度对待农业生产这门科学；无论干什么，都只准一个“模子”，即所谓“整齐划一”、“一律化”之类。这样，他自己想“省事”，却给下面的干部和社员群众造成很大的麻烦，他以为很“好看”，如果老赵听他的话，那末，生产一定搞得很难看。“好看”和“难看”，不只是在形式上，而主要的是在内容上。就农业生产来说，增产才好看，如果不增产，有什么好看呢？作为一个领导干部，自己不听党的话，不听群众的话，反而在善于听话的好同志的头上扣一顶“不听话”的大帽子，这是很不光彩的。
    作为下级干部来说，对于上面的指示是应当坚决执行的。如果认为可以把上面的指示丢在一边而各行其是，那是无组织无纪律的行为。那末，能不能说老赵的这种坚持革命精神、坚持科学精神的做法是无组织无纪律的行为呢？不能这样说。实际上，老赵的做法是完全合乎党的政策和群众的要求的。就领导的责任来说，问题在于那位“个别领导干部”违背了党的政策和群众的要求，可以说他是站在老赵头上搞主观主义、命令主义。就老赵本人来说，应当一方面积极地向上面反映情况和意见，同时，根据党的政策和群众的要求办事。
    均县县委处理这个“不听话的队长”的做法是完全正确的。事后看来，由于推广了赵以约的经验，在全县开展一个开荒炕地多种多收的群众运动，取得了伟大的成绩。这种成绩的由来，也可以归功于均县县委善于听党的话，听群众的话，善于把敢想敢干的革命精神和实事求是的科学精神结合起来，也可以说，均县县委是善于识别干部的。
    不要只是像“念经”一样地重复着“听党的话，听群众的话”，而要在实践当中真正地、严格地按照党的政策和群众的要求办事。要像赵以约那样地对待党的政策和群众的要求，千万不要像那位“个别领导干部”那样地对待党的政策和群众的要求。
    我们全省有成千上万的赵以约，也有少数的“个别领导干部”。因此，要像均县县委那样善于发扬赵以约的经验，认真推广赵以约的经验。要坚决同“个别领导干部”的那种主观主义、命令主义作风开火，把那种坏作风来个干净彻底全部消灭！
