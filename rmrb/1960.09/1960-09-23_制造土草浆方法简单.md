　　Small Information

    The method for manufacturing indigenous grass pulp is very simple. Just chop up rice straw, wheat stalks, or other grasses, mix in some lime or alkaline soil, add water and steam, or use natural fermentation to rot the grass into pulp. Then press out the water and dry it in the sun to create pulp boards, which can be used as papermaking raw materials.
    Producing indigenous grass pulp doesn't require very strong labor either. Some people's communes in Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shandong, and other provinces, following the principle of doing it extensively during the agricultural off-season, doing it less during the agricultural busy season, and not doing it at all during the peak agricultural season, try to utilize some women or elderly and semi-able-bodied labor for year-round production. Only during the agricultural off-season do they mobilize the masses for a concentrated production push, and they start and stop production as they see fit. Or they set up the sites and rot the raw materials well, and produce whenever they have time. As a result, both indigenous grass pulp production and agricultural production have been developed.

　　制造土草浆方法简单
    制造土草浆的方法很简单。只要把稻草、麦秸或其他草类切碎，拌上一些石灰或土碱，加水蒸煮，或利用自然发酵的办法，把草沤成纸浆，然后再把水分压去、晒干，就成了纸浆板，可以作造纸原料。
    生产土草浆也不需要很强壮的劳动力。吉林、黑龙江、山东等省有些地区的人民公社本着农闲大搞、农忙小搞、大忙不搞的原则，尽量利用一些妇女或老弱半劳动力进行常年生产；只有在农闲时才发动群众突击生产，而且是说干就干、说停就停，或者安好摊子，沤好原料，什么时候有空，什么时候生产。结果既发展了土草浆，又发展了农业生产。
