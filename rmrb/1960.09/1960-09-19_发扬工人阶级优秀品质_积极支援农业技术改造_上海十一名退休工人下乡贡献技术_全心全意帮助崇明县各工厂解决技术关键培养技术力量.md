Promoting the Excellent Qualities of the Working Class and Actively Supporting Agricultural Technological Transformation
Eleven Retired Workers from Shanghai Contribute Technology to the Countryside
Wholeheartedly Helping Chongming County Factories Solve Key Technical Problems and Cultivate Technical Personnel

    According to *Jiefang Daily* news: Eleven energetic retired veteran workers from Yangpu District, Shanghai, actively responded to the Party's call to "vigorously develop agriculture and grain production," consciously requesting to contribute to agricultural technological transformation. With the strong support of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions and the Yangpu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, they formed a special team to support agricultural technological transformation and went to Chongming County as technical consultants. For more than a month, they have carried forward the glorious traditions of the working class, wholeheartedly using their rich technical experience to solve many key technical problems for local factories and cultivate a group of technical personnel.

    These veteran workers are: Gu Fusheng, Yu Jinchang, Cai Xingsheng, Jiang Chunlin, Shen Dingguo, Chen Shunsheng, Zhang Shunsheng, Mao Chengkun, Li Chuanzheng, Qin Yuanhong, and Xu Hongru. They all have 30 to 40 years of operating experience and a high level of class consciousness. Before going to Chongming County, they had already retired and were enjoying a happy life in their later years. After the Party issued the call for all sectors to support agriculture, they couldn't stay idle. These veteran workers deeply understood the importance of agricultural construction from their own experiences and were determined to contribute to the glorious task of supporting agriculture.

    The Yangpu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attached great importance to the enthusiasm of these veteran workers to support agriculture. After specific research with the Chongming County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, it was decided to assign them to work in major factories such as the Chongming No. 1 Iron and Steel Machinery Factory, the Chongming Fishing Boat Repair Factory, and the Chongming Power Plant. These factories are the "old hens" and "pioneers" of agricultural technological transformation and agricultural production development in Chongming County. In mid-July and early August, these veteran workers came to Chongming County in batches. The leaders of Chongming County showed great concern for them, specifically considering each person's physical condition, deciding that retired veteran workers would work as technical consultants in factories, with daily working hours not exceeding six hours; their daily life and diet were also well taken care of.

    The retired veteran workers arrived at their new posts full of energy and enthusiasm. Although the local factories took great care of them because of their age, they did not admit defeat to old age. They went deep into the workshops and work sections every day, researching and discussing with the workers, and sometimes even did it themselves. In more than a month, they have helped these factories solve many key technical problems. In the past, tinsmiths at the Chongming No. 1 Iron and Steel Machinery Factory often couldn't hammer the cover of the green fodder cutter properly, and it took a long time. Yu Jinchang, a veteran coppersmith from the former China Shipbuilding Factory, saw this on his first day in the workshop. He took the hammer and hammered about twenty times, and the iron sheet lay flat on the ground. He said to the tinsmith, "When hammering iron sheets, you should hammer from the outside to the inside, not from the inside to the outside; you should hammer all around, not just where it's uneven." The workers followed Master Yu's method, and sure enough, they hammered better and saved effort, and the efficiency was doubled. The simplified saw beds recast at the Chongming Fishing Boat Repair Factory often had sand holes. Master Cai Xingsheng, a molder from the former Daxin Iron Factory with more than 50 years of molding experience, found on his first day in the workshop that the cause of the sand holes was that the sand was too damp. He prescribed the right remedy, and the sand hole problem was quickly solved. Master Shen Dingguo, a fitter from the former Shanghai Foundry Machinery Factory, found that the general lathe tools at the Chongming No. 1 Iron and Steel Machinery Factory only cut two millimeters, and the cutting efficiency was not high. He guided the workers to grind the tools according to the different processing requirements of the workpieces, so that the cutting depth was generally increased to three millimeters, improving the cutting efficiency.

    These veteran workers came to Chongming County not only to support agricultural technological transformation, but also to set an example for local employees with their selfless, responsible, and meticulous work attitude. When they arrived at the factory, they were very concerned about product quality, product use effect, and the feedback from the peasant brothers. As soon as Master Gu Fusheng, Mao Chengkun, Xu Hongru, and other teachers arrived at the factory, they conducted a comprehensive observation of various machine tools and proposed measures to improve machine maintenance and tool storage to ensure product quality. The older workers in the Chongming Yarn Factory, seeing their responsible attitude, said that they would learn from them and better contribute all their technology to the country. Some young workers at the Chongming No. 1 Iron and Steel Machinery Factory used to think that they could operate independently after two years, and they were a little complacent. Now, compared with the veteran workers, they felt that they were far from enough and said that they would learn from the veteran workers.

    Faced with the ever-changing new countryside and the vigorous development of local industry, these eleven veteran workers all felt infinite excitement, and they all said that they had become younger. They said that they would contribute all their technology to the countryside.

    发扬工人阶级优秀品质　积极支援农业技术改造
    上海十一名退休工人下乡贡献技术
    全心全意帮助崇明县各工厂解决技术关键培养技术力量
    据解放日报消息　上海杨浦区十一位精力充沛的退休老工人，积极响应党的“大办农业，大办粮食”的号召，自觉地要求为农业技术改造出一把力。他们在上海市总工会和中共杨浦区委的大力支持下，组成了一支支援农业技术改造的特种队伍，前往崇明县担任技术顾问。一个多月来，他们发扬了工人阶级的光荣传统，全心全意运用自己丰富的技术经验，为当地工厂解决了不少技术关键问题，培养了一批技术力量。
    这些老工人是：顾复声、虞锦昌、蔡杏生、蒋春林、沈定国、陈顺生、张顺生、毛成坤、李传正、秦元宏和徐鸿如。他们都有三、四十年的操作经验，具有较高的阶级觉悟。在去崇明县之前，他们已经退休养老，安度晚年的幸福生活。在党发出了各行各业支援农业的号召后，他们闲不住了。这些老工人从自己的经历中深深体会到农业建设的重要，决心在支援农业的光荣任务中尽一分力量。
    中共杨浦区委十分重视这些老工人支援农业的积极性，经过与中共崇明县委具体研究，决定把他们分配在崇明第一钢铁机械厂、崇明渔轮修造厂、崇明发电厂等主要工厂工作。这些工厂都是崇明县农业技术改造和发展农业生产的“老母鸡”和“先行官”。7月中旬和8月上旬，这些老工人分批来到了崇明县。崇明县的领导方面对他们十分关怀，具体考虑了每个人的身体情况，决定退休老工人下厂做技术顾问，每天工作时间最多不能超过六小时；对他们的起居饮食也都十分照顾。
    退休老工人们来到新工作岗位上，个个精神抖擞，干劲十足。虽然当地工厂因为他们年纪大，对他们百般照顾，但他们并不服老，每天深入车间、工段，与工人一同研究、一同商量，有时还亲自动手，一个多月来，已经帮助这些工厂解决了很多技术关键问题。崇明第一钢铁机械厂白铁工过去敲青饲料切割机上的罩壳常常敲不好，花的时间很长。原中华造船厂老铜工虞锦昌第一天下车间看到后，接过鎯头，敲了二十下左右，铁皮就服贴地平卧在地上了。他对白铁工说：“敲铁皮应该从外敲到内，不能从内敲到外；要四周都敲，不能哪里不平单敲哪里。”工人依照虞师傅指导的方法来敲，果然敲得又好又省劲，效率提高了一倍。崇明渔轮修造厂翻铸简易锯床常有砂眼。有五十多年造型经验的原大新铁厂造型工蔡杏生师傅，第一天进车间就找出发生砂眼的原因是沙泥过潮，对症下药，砂眼问题很快就解决了。原上海铸造机械厂钳工沈定国老师傅发现崇明第一钢铁机械厂一般车刀吃刀只有两毫米，切削效率不高，就按工作物的不同加工要求，指导工人磨刀，使吃刀普遍加深到三毫米，提高了切削效率。
    这些老工人来到崇明县，不仅支援了农业技术改造，还以他们的克己为公、认真负责、一丝不苟的工作态度，为当地职工树立了榜样。他们到了工厂，都非常关心产品质量、产品使用效果和农民兄弟的反映。顾复声、毛成坤、徐鸿如等老师傅一到工厂，就对各种机床进行全面的观察，提出了改进机器保养、工夹具保管等措施，以保证产品质量。崇明纱厂的老年工人看到他们这种负责态度，表示要向他们学习，更好地把所有的技术贡献给国家。崇明第一钢铁机械厂有的青年工人过去认为两年来已能独立操作，有点自满，现在与老工人一比，觉得太不够了，都表示要向老工人们好好学习。
    面对着日新月异的新农村和蓬勃发展的地方工业，这十一位老工人都感到无限兴奋，他们都说自己变年轻了。他们表示要把所有的技术贡献给农村。
