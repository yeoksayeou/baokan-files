Seeing Chairman Mao's eight characters "Self-Reliance" and "Ample Food and Clothing" for the troops' production campaign during the Anti-Japanese War again in the newspaper, I feel infinitely close to them.

It was in the spring of 1944 that a group of students from the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in the Taihang area transferred to Yan'an. In our minds, Yan'an was such a wonderful place! This is the holy land of revolution, and here we have our great leader Chairman Mao. There must be no shortage of food or clothing here, and it is a good place for us to study and work. When we first saw the Yan'an Pagoda, everyone jumped up with joy. At that time, we were all very young and thought that everything would be fine once we arrived in Yan'an. Comrade Xu Xiangqian came to give us a mobilization report. His speech was not long, but it really cured our illusions. The gist of Comrade Xu Xiangqian's speech was:

Do you want to come to Yan'an to study hard? That's great! Have you heard that life in the border region is one of ample food and clothing? Absolutely right. But there is one condition: everything must be done by ourselves. Aren't we giving each of you a hoe? Okay, ask it for everything! It can provide you with everything.

Many of our comrades were stunned. It turned out that we only unilaterally knew that the border region was "ample in food and clothing," but we forgot the most fundamental point, which was to "do it ourselves." Most of our comrades were intellectuals, and at that time, we could not deeply understand the profound meaning of the slogan "Self-Reliance" and "Ample Food and Clothing," as well as the connection between the slogan, but we firmly believed that the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao were correct. The next day, we carried our backpacks and hoes and set off for the mountainous area of Shangpingchuan, Heshui County, Longdong.

When we arrived at Shangpingchuan in Heshui County, although there were few people, it was really a good place. It was surrounded by fertile barren slopes, clear springs in the gullies, and dense forests. We started a new world with our own hands on this treasure land. If there was no place to live, we dug cave dwellings; if there was no firewood to burn, we carried it from the mountains; we reclaimed wasteland, sowed seeds, weeded, harvested in autumn, husked rice, and ground flour, all by ourselves; we developed all-round development in growing vegetables, raising pigs, sheep, cattle, and chickens. In less than a year, when winter came, we really achieved ample food and clothing. And all of this was exactly as Comrade Xu Xiangqian said: ask it for everything! - the result of asking the hoe.

We each planted an average of more than 20 mu of land, and the grain we harvested was really inexhaustible. Our cook squad leader was an old Red Army soldier and was very good at cooking. Whether it was millet rice or steamed millet buns, they were fragrant and sweet. There was everything to eat: potatoes, cabbage, radishes, bean sprouts, tofu, and cold buckwheat noodles were all abundant. And the mushrooms we picked were really unique. The clothes we wore were also comfortable enough, "a body of hair from head to toe." We had woolen socks, woolen trousers, woolen sweaters, and woolen gloves. Although they were made of wool yarn, they were very warm to wear. In winter, we used the charcoal we burned ourselves to keep warm, and we studied in classrooms we built ourselves. The benches and tables we used for studying were completely made by ourselves. During the New Year, we also self-composed and self-sang, and actively carried out cultural and recreational activities, and even the huqin we played was made by ourselves! At this time, we felt as if our life was the happiest in the world. By this time, we had a better understanding of the meaning of "Self-Reliance" and "Ample Food and Clothing."

In an instant, more than ten years have passed. "Self-Reliance" and "Ample Food and Clothing" is how we have come through the past. For the past eleven years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have been carrying out socialist construction. At that time, we lived in cave dwellings, but now we have "upstairs and downstairs, electric lights and telephones." At that time, we all wore homespun clothes, homespun shoes and socks, and homespun hats, but now aren't we all wearing fine cloth clothes, foreign socks, and leather shoes, and wearing felt hats? But this is far from the ample food and clothing we dream of. Our country is so big, the population is so large, and the past foundation was too weak. To fundamentally change the "poor and blank" face of our country and accelerate the development of socialist construction, we need to continue to carry forward our revolutionary family heirloom - "Self-Reliance" and "Ample Food and Clothing."

As the saying goes, "Relying on heaven and relying on earth is not as good as relying on yourself." The revolutionary proletariat relies on the labor of their own hands to declare war on the old world!

### “一切就向它要！”

    “一切就向它要！”	张天林
    在报上又看到毛主席在抗日战争时期为部队生产运动题的“自己动手”、“丰衣足食”八个大字，真是感到无限亲切。
    还是在1944年开春的时候，我们在太行区的抗日军政大学的一批学生转移到了延安。延安，在我们的心目中是多好的地方啊！这儿是革命圣地，这儿有我们伟大的领袖毛主席。这儿一定不缺吃，不缺穿，是我们学习和工作的好地方。我们初看到延安宝塔的时候，大家高兴得蹦了起来。当时我们都很年轻，满以为到了延安就一切万事大吉了。徐向前同志来给我们做了个动员报告。他讲的话不长，可真治好了我们的幻想病。徐向前同志讲话的大意是：
    你们想来延安好好学习吗？这太好了！你们听说边区的生活是丰衣足食吗？完全对。但是有一条：一切得自己动手。现在不是发给你们每人一把镢头吗？好吧，一切就向它要！它可以供给你们一切。
    这下我们有不少同志楞住了。原来我们光片面地知道边区是“丰衣足食”，但却忘了最根本的一条，要“自己动手”。我们绝大部分同志都是知识分子出身，当时还不能够深刻理解“自己动手”、“丰衣足食”这个口号的深远意义，以及这个口号前后的联系性，但是我们却坚信党和毛主席的指示是正确的。第二天，就背起背包、扛起镢头向陇东合水县山区进发了。
    到达了合水县的上坪川，这儿虽然人烟稀少，可真是块好地方。四周是肥沃的荒坡地，沟里有清清的泉水，有密密的森林。我们就在这块宝地上自己动手开创一个新天地。没有住，打窑洞；没有柴烧，上山扛；开荒、播种、锄草、秋收、碾米、磨面，完全自己动手；种菜、养猪、养羊、养牛、养鸡全面发展。不到一年，冬季来临的时候，我们果真达到了丰衣足食。而这一切，也正是像徐向前同志说的：一切就向它要！——向镢头要的结果。
    我们每人平均种了二十多亩地，打的粮食真是吃不完。我们的炊事班长是个老红军，很会做饭。不论做糜子干饭或糜面蒸馍馍，做的又香又甜。菜是应有尽有：山药蛋、白菜、萝卜、豆芽、豆腐、荞麦面凉粉都很丰盛。还有我们采的木耳，真是别有风味。穿的也够舒服了，“浑身上下一身毛”。毛袜、毛裤、毛衣、毛手套都有，虽然是羊毛线打的，穿起来却很舒暖。冬天，我们用自己烧的木炭烤火，而且在自己亲手盖的课室里学习了。我们学习用的板凳、桌子完全是自己做的。过年的时候，我们还自编、自唱，活跃地开展了文化娱乐活动，连拉的胡琴也是自己造的哩！这时，我们觉得好像世界上只有我们的生活是最幸福的了。到这个时候，我们才算比较懂得了“自己动手”、“丰衣足食”的意义。
    一瞬间十多年了。“自己动手”、“丰衣足食”，我们过去的路就是这样走过来的。建国十一年来，我们进行着社会主义建设。那时，我们住窑洞，现在却有了“楼上楼下、电灯电话”。那时，我们穿的一律是土布衣服、土布鞋袜，戴的也是土布帽，现在不是普遍穿起细布衣服、洋袜子、皮鞋，戴起呢子帽了吗？但这还远远不是我们理想中的丰衣足食。我们的国家是这样大，人口是这样多，而过去的底子又太薄了。要从根本上改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌，加速发展社会主义建设事业，还需要继续发扬我们革命的传家宝——“自己动手”、“丰衣足食”。
    俗话说：“靠天靠地，不如靠自己”。革命的无产阶级正是依靠自己劳动的双手，向旧世界宣战的！
