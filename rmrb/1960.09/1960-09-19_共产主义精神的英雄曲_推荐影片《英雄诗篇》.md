    Heroic Ode to the Communist Spirit
    ——Recommending the Film "Heroic Epic"	Wang Yunman
    "Heroic Epic" is a film that is impossible to watch calmly; as you watch, your entire heart and all your emotions are drawn into the most beautiful and moving life, into the most sublime and magnificent spiritual world, drawn to the side of the heroes, to the side of the Party...
    "Heroic Epic" recreates the story of the Ma Kou police team in Yingde County, Guangzhou, fighting the flames to save state property; it recreates the story of the entire Party and the entire people rescuing these heroes who were injured in the fire. The film, with its thoughtful and meticulous artistic treatment, portrays this heroic event with a high degree of communist spirit.
    The film's great success is due to its firm grasp of the most essential and typical elements of this true event, successfully depicting a series of dazzling heroic figures. The event itself contains strong dramatic elements, but the film, from beginning to end, never deviates from the requirements of the theme, never one-sidedly pursuing twists and turns or tension. Here, the entire development and arrangement of the plot is intended to more forcefully, more prominently, and more deeply express the central spirit of this event – the communist style. The many characters in the film are unforgettable precisely because they embody the spirit of our times, the character traits shared by our millions of heroic people. We see: in the scene of the police rescuing the fire, which is not long after the beginning of the film, what best embodies the thoughts and characters of these heroic figures? When the raging fire surrounds the police, when it seems there is no way out and no retreat, in this critical moment, one of the police team members faces the flames, quickly uses a stick to pry open a gap, letting his comrades rush out, while he himself risks being burned, risking death, holding the burning door frame above his head to prevent it from collapsing and injuring his comrades... In the fire, seeing that barrels of burning gasoline are seriously threatening the factory's valuable property and the safety of the people, the police officers are risking their lives to rescue them. Suddenly, one of the gasoline barrels is about to explode due to the high heat. Several police officers, seeing this situation, scramble to pounce on the gasoline barrel, to salvage it in case of emergency, none of them caring about their own lives, only fearing that their comrades will be harmed... These detailed portrayals fully and clearly embody the ideological significance of this fire-fighting scene. This is the spirit of selflessness and public service of our heroic police officers, their fearless and loyal class qualities, the spirit of revolutionary fighters who dare to go through fire and water and despise all difficulties and dangers. It is because they possess such valuable, communist ideological qualities that they are able to complete such a heroic task under the threat of extremely difficult disasters, and fulfill the sacred duties entrusted to them by the Party and the people.
    The film not only focuses on portraying the actions of the heroes in fighting the fire, but also, through their performance during the treatment process after being injured, further and more comprehensively depicts the spiritual outlook of these heroic figures. Many police team members are seriously injured and on the verge of death, but, represented by the severely injured Captain Ma Delin and young police officer Su Manji, everyone is optimistic and happy, tenacious and resolute, full of confidence and ideals in life, treatment, and the future; just as Ma Delin conveyed on behalf of the Party branch to all the injured police officers: "Treatment is also a battle." Although Ma Delin and Su Manji and others eventually sacrificed gloriously due to their serious injuries, they, like all the comrades who were rescued, demonstrated the tenacious will of revolutionary fighters to overcome great difficulties and pain during the treatment process.
    If the film only revolves around the portrayal of these police heroes, it would not be enough to reflect this heroic event in the most profound and moving way. It is not just some people who have composed this magnificent and great poem, but the entire Party and the entire people. The film places the full support and infinite care of the entire Party and the entire people for this event in a central position for depiction, allowing us to see the face of our great era through this event. Some of the descriptions in the film of the injured being transported to Guangzhou for treatment; the interweaving of the plot of the plane breaking the routine and transporting plasma in the rainstorm, are particularly exciting. We see: in order to reduce the pain of the injured, a passenger on the train - a general - stood up, and with a command, the officers and soldiers of the three armed forces and other passengers on the train took the initiative to sign up to become volunteer stretcher bearers. We also see: it is precisely under the conditions of the train's rapid progress and the extremely difficult treatment that the chief physician of the provincial hospital overcomes difficulties time and time again to save the lives of the patients. The description of the plane sent from Nanjing to transport plasma, due to the film's use of cross-cutting montage techniques, is tightly connected with the shots of the train transporting patients to Guangzhou and the Guangzhou hospital needing a large amount of plasma, thus further highlighting the will and determination of the Party and the people to go all out and overcome all difficulties to rescue the injured, and further demonstrating the greatest concern of the entire Party and the entire people for the police heroes. The Party and the people of the whole country are at all times flesh and blood connected with these selfless police heroes, sharing the same breath. In the film, the scene of the Party Central Committee making a long-distance call to comfort the injured and deciding to send the injured to Guangzhou for treatment, more concentratedly and clearly embodies this idea. We see that, thanks to the joint efforts of the entire Party and the entire people, the lives of many heroes were finally saved from near death. It should be said that it is our great Party, our great people, and our great era that have cultivated these brilliant heroes in the Ma Kou incident.
      "Heroic Epic" is worthy of praise, and worthy of loud praise. The people need such meaningful, enthusiastic, and idealistic films, which reflect our great era and people, and at the same time will give the broad masses a profound and strong ideological impact. (Attached picture)

### 共产主义精神的英雄曲——推荐影片《英雄诗篇》

    共产主义精神的英雄曲
    ——推荐影片《英雄诗篇》	王云缦
    《英雄诗篇》是这样一部影片：要想很平静地看完它是不可能的；看着看着，我们整个的心，全部思想感情都被它吸引了去，吸引到那种最美好、最动人的生活里去，吸引到那种最崇高、最伟大的精神世界里去，吸引到英雄们的身边，党的身边……。
    《英雄诗篇》再现了广州英德县马口民警队为了抢救国家财产，与烈火搏斗的事迹；再现了全党全民抢救这些为救火负伤的英雄们的事迹。影片正是以它富有思想性的，精心的艺术处理，刻划了这一具有高度共产主义精神的英雄事件。
    影片获得极大成功的原因，是由于它紧紧抓住了这一真实事件中最本质、最典型的东西，成功地描写了一系列光辉夺目的英雄人物。这一事件本身就包含了浓厚的戏剧性情节，但是，影片自始至终，从没有离开主题的要求，片面去追求什么曲折和紧张。在这里，整个故事情节的发展、安排，都是为了更有力、更突出、更深化这一事件的中心精神——共产主义的风格。影片上的许多人物，所以令人铭刻难忘，也正因为他们体现了我们的时代精神，体现了我们千万英雄人民所共有的性格特征。我们看：就在影片开始不久的那个民警救火的场面里，是什么最能体现这些英雄人物的思想、性格呢？当熊熊烈火包围着民警们时，眼看是前无出路、后无退途了，在这千钧一发之间，一位民警队员向火口迎去，迅速地用棍子挑开一条缺口，让同志们冲了出去，自己却冒着被烧伤、烧死的危险，将被烈火烧燃了的门架子托在头顶以免坍塌下来打伤同志……，在火场中，眼看那一桶桶燃烧着的汽油，正严重威胁着工厂的宝贵财产和人们的安全的时候，民警们个个奋不顾身地在进行抢救。突然，其中的一个汽油桶由于火的热度太高，立即就要爆炸了，几位民警看到这种情况，相互争着向汽油筒扑去，以作万一的挽救，谁都不顾自己的生命危险，唯恐让同志们受到伤害，……这些细节的突出刻划，就将这一救火场景的思想意义比较充分、比较鲜明地体现了出来。这就是我们英雄民警们那种舍己为人、公而忘私的精神，那种英勇无畏、忠诚坚定的阶级品质，那种勇于赴汤蹈火、蔑视一切困难艰险的革命战士的气概。正因为他们具备了这样可贵的、共产主义者的思想品质，所以能够在万分艰巨的灾害威胁下，完成了这样一项英雄的工作，完成了党和人民交付给他们的神圣职责。
    影片不仅着力刻划了英雄们在救火中的行动，而且，通过他们在负伤后治疗过程中的表现，更进一步和更多方面地描绘了这些英雄人物的精神面貌。许多民警队员，都是身负重伤，危在旦夕，但是，以伤势极重的队长马德林和青年民警苏满基为代表，人人乐观愉快，顽强坚毅，对生活、对治疗、对未来充满了信心和理想；正如马德林代表党支部向全体民警伤员传达的：“治疗也是一场战斗。”虽然，马德林和苏满基等由于受伤过重，终于光荣地牺牲了，但是，他们同所有被救活了的同志们一样，在治疗过程中表现出革命战士战胜巨大困难和痛苦的顽强意志。
    要是影片只是围绕着这些民警英雄来刻划，还不足以最深刻、最动人地反映这一英雄事件。谱写了这一首壮丽而又伟大的诗篇的，不是某些人，而是全党全民。影片将全党全民全力支援和无限关怀这一事件，放在中心地位上来描写，让我们透过这一事件，看到了我们伟大时代的面貌。影片中，伤员们被运往广州治疗时途中的一些描写；飞机打破常规、冒着暴风雨运送血浆的情节穿插，都是特别扣人心弦的。我们看到：为了减少伤员的震痛，火车上的一位旅客——将军，站了出来，一声令下，车上三军官兵和其他旅客，纷纷主动报名，担当起了抬担架的志愿兵。我们也看到：正是在列车飞速前进、治疗万分艰巨的情况下，省医院的主治医生，一次再次克服困难，抢救了病人的生命。从南京派飞机运血浆的描写，由于影片以交叉的蒙太奇手法，与火车运病人去广州、广州医院需要大量血浆的镜头紧凑地组接在一起，因而更烘托出了党和人民为抢救伤员全力以赴、冲破一切困难的意志和决心，更显示出了全党全民对民警英雄们的最大关注。党和全国人民，任何时候都是与这些忘我的民警英雄血肉相连、吸呼与共的。在影片中，党中央打长途电话来慰问伤员，决定送伤员去广州治疗的场面，更将这一思想最集中、最鲜明地体现出来。我们看到，由于是全党全民的共同努力，终于在九死一生之中挽救了许多英雄们的生命。应该说，正是我们伟大的党、伟大的人民、伟大的时代，培养出了马口事件中的这些光辉灿烂的英雄们。
      “英雄诗篇”是值得赞美的，而且是值得大声赞美的。人民需要这样有意义、有热情、有理想的影片，它反映了我们伟大的时代和人民，同时，也将给广大群众以极深刻、极强烈的思想影响。（附图片）
