    Utilizing Industrial Waste Heat to Grow Vegetables: Increased Vegetable Yields and Reduced Costs

    In the north, fresh vegetables during the winter are mainly grown in greenhouses. Currently, greenhouse vegetable cultivation generally uses coal as a heat source, which makes the price of vegetables expensive. Currently, some regions in the Soviet Union have been using waste heat from industry as a heat source for vegetable greenhouses, with very good results.

    In many industrial enterprises such as power stations, metallurgical plants, and oil refineries, a lot of waste heat is discharged every day, such as steam, hot water, and hot air. Using this waste heat to cultivate greenhouse vegetables can save a lot of fuel, thereby reducing the cost of vegetables. In addition, industrial waste heat contains abundant carbon dioxide, which is particularly effective in promoting plant growth. For example, the Moscow Oil Refinery used flue gas from a thermal power station to supply carbon dioxide to vegetable greenhouses, resulting in a bumper vegetable harvest. Workers ate a lot of cheap, fresh cucumbers in the winter.

    In addition, the use of steam can also frequently sterilize the soil in greenhouses and improve soil fertility.

    The "White Villa" state farm is building the largest waste heat-heated greenhouse-hotbed complex in the Moscow region near the factory. This complex will have 70,000 square meters of greenhouses, all heated by factory waste heat, which can save more than 50,000 tons of coal each year. Ten greenhouses with an area of ​​10,000 square meters have already been put into production. The people of the Soviet capital will get a lot of cheap, fresh vegetables from here.

    利用工业废热培育蔬菜  蔬菜产量增加成本降低
    在北方，冬季要吃新鲜的蔬菜主要是温室栽培的。目前，温室种植蔬菜一般都用煤作为热源，这样就使菜的价格昂贵。目前，苏联一些地区已经利用工业中的废热作为蔬菜温室的热源，获得了很好的效果。
    在电站、冶金工厂、炼油厂等许多工业企业中，每天都要排出许多废热，如蒸汽、热水和热气等。利用这些废热来培育温室蔬菜，就能节省大量的燃料，从而降低菜的成本。另外，工业废热中含有丰富的二氧化碳，特别能促进植物的生长。例如，莫斯科石油炼制厂利用热电站的烟道气给蔬菜温室供应二氧化碳，结果蔬菜丰收。工人们在冬天吃到了许多便宜的新鲜黄瓜。
    此外，利用蒸汽还可以经常在温室里进行土壤灭菌工作，并提高土壤肥力。
    “白色别墅”国营农场正在工厂附近建设莫斯科州最大的利用废热加温的温室——温床联合企业，这个联合企业将拥有七万平方米的温室，全部用工厂废热加温，每年可节省五万多吨煤。现在已有面积达一万平方米的十个温室投入生产。苏联首都人民将从这里得到大量便宜的新鲜蔬菜。
