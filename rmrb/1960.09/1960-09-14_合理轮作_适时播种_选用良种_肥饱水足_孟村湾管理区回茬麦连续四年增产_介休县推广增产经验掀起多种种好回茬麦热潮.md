Editor's Note: "Autumn Equinox" is the sowing season for major wheat-producing areas. Now, with only nine days until the "Autumn Equinox," this is a decisive battle that will determine the summer harvest next year. We should make all preparations and sow the seeds of a bountiful harvest when the sowing season arrives.

The current rural situation is very good. Under the Party's instructions to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, leadership organs at all levels have delegated a large number of cadres to strengthen the grassroots, and many strong laborers have concentrated on the front line of production. While striving to harvest more grain in the autumn, the masses have formulated plans to expand the area sown in autumn. However, we should also see the new circumstances existing in this year's autumn planting work, mainly: First, more late autumn crops are being planted this year. If late autumn crops cannot be harvested before wheat is sown, it will affect timely wheat sowing; second, the multiple cropping index in various places is higher than in previous years this year, and the autumn sowing area will be larger than in previous years. How to ensure that the autumn sowing area is implemented is another major issue.

With problems, there are also solutions. The key lies in fully mobilizing the masses and adopting measures appropriate to local conditions. The Mengcunwan Management District's experience in increasing wheat production, published in this newspaper today, is one such example.

Rational Crop Rotation, Timely Sowing, Selection of Fine Varieties, Sufficient Fertilizer and Water
Mengcunwan Management District Achieves Continuous Wheat Production Increase for Four Years
Jiexu County Promotes Increased Production Experience, Launching a Surge of Planting and Cultivating Wheat

Xinhua News Agency Report: Jiexu County, Shanxi Province, has been promoting the experience of the Mengcunwan Management District of Zhanglan Commune in achieving continuous wheat production increases for four years, adapting measures to local conditions to ensure that this year's wheat crop is planted and cultivated well.

The Jiexu County Party Committee recently summarized the Mengcunwan Management District's experience in achieving continuous wheat production increases for four years. These experiences are: implementing crop rotation, timely sowing, selecting fine varieties, and ensuring sufficient fertilizer and water. Based on the specific conditions of the area, the Mengcunwan Management District summarized the inherent experiences of the masses and implemented planned and rational crop rotation. They transformed the one-crop-per-year cultivation system into a two-crop-per-year system. There are three methods of crop rotation: one is six harvests in four years, that is, harvesting wheat in the first year, followed by mung beans, then harvesting mung beans and planting wheat again; harvesting wheat in the second year, followed by millet; harvesting sorghum or sweet potatoes in the third year; and harvesting corn in the fourth year, followed by wheat. Another is five harvests in three years, that is, harvesting corn in the first year, followed by wheat; harvesting wheat in the second year, followed by mung beans, then harvesting mung beans and planting wheat again; and harvesting wheat in the third year, followed by millet. Yet another is four harvests in three years, that is, harvesting corn in the first year, followed by wheat; harvesting wheat in the second year, followed by millet; and planting sorghum or sweet potatoes in the third year. The common feature of these three methods is that every three to four years, a piece of land can not only harvest one to two seasons of high-yield autumn crops, but also harvest one to two more seasons of small autumn crops. After the autumn crops are harvested, all wheat fields can be planted with the best vegetable, mung bean, and corn stubble. This is because vegetable stubble is heavily fertilized, matures early, and saves soil fertility; mung bean stubble leaves behind the necessary rhizobium for wheat growth; although corn stubble is harvested later, the previous crop receives more topdressing and sufficient watering, and the water and fertilizer can also meet the needs of wheat growth and development. In recent years, by mastering the above rules, wheat has been planted according to the type of stubble, time, and local conditions.

The most suitable sowing period for wheat in this area is around the "Autumn Equinox." Because the Mengcunwan Management District has implemented rational crop rotation and planted wheat on the land of early-maturing crops such as vegetables and mung beans, it is generally sown on time around the "Autumn Equinox." In addition, by rationally planning labor and animal power, and implementing simultaneous harvesting and sowing for late-maturing corn stubble, they ensured that wheat was sown within ten days after the "Autumn Equinox," giving the wheat sufficient time to develop its roots and promote effective tillering.

They also selected the excellent "Locust Wheat" variety, which matures early, has stable yields, thick stalks, strong leaves, does not lodge easily, and has thick, large ears with full grains, to address the problem of late sowing and fewer tillers in wheat. In order to ensure sufficient fertilizer and water, the management district raised 1,260 pigs, accumulating more than 47,000 dan of pig manure throughout the year. Calculated on the basis of two harvests in three years for all land, each sowing could apply 28 dan of pig manure per mu, plus human and animal manure and green manure, straw manure, etc., with an average of more than 60 dan of base fertilizer per mu. Ninety-five percent of the management district's land can be irrigated with the Fen River, and can be watered twice a year to promote early maturity of previous crops, creating favorable conditions for timely wheat sowing.

Currently, all people's communes in the county are widely promoting the Mengcunwan Management District's experience in achieving continuous wheat production increases, launching a surge of planting and cultivating wheat. After specific planning, people's communes such as Zhanglan, Yi'an, and Chengguan have allocated the task of planting 15,000 mu of wheat to previous crops such as vegetables, mung beans, and corn. In order to promote the early maturity of 20,000 mu of small autumn crops and ensure timely wheat sowing, the Hongshan People's Commune recently organized a specialized team of 5,000 people to universally carry out additional hoeing and fertilization for small autumn crops. All people's communes in the county have prepared 26 million dan of various base fertilizers for planting wheat, an average of 40 dan per mu. The eight people's communes in the plains area have mutually adjusted 210,000 jin of excellent varieties such as "Locust Wheat" and "Zhongsu No. 68"; the thirteen people's communes in the mountainous areas have all adjusted wheat varieties with shorter growing periods such as "Beijing No. 11" and "April Yellow" according to local conditions.

### 合理轮作　适时播种　选用良种　肥饱水足  孟村湾管理区回茬麦连续四年增产  介休县推广增产经验掀起多种种好回茬麦热潮

    编者按：“秋分”是主要麦产区的播种节令。现在距“秋分”只有九天了，这是关系到明年夏季丰收的一场有决定意义的战斗，我们应该做好一切准备工作，只等播种季节到来，适时撒下丰收种子。
    当前农村形势很好。在党的大办农业、大办粮食的指示下，各级领导机关下放大批干部充实基层，许多精壮劳力集中到生产第一线，群众在争取秋季多收粮的同时，制订了扩大秋种面积的计划。但是，我们也应该看到今年秋播工作中存在的新情况，主要是：一、今年晚秋作物种的多，如果晚秋作物不能在小麦播种前收获，就会影响小麦适时播种；二，今年各地的复种指数都比往年提高，而秋播面积又将比往年扩大，如何使秋播面积落实，这又是一个大问题。
    有问题，也就有解决问题的办法。关键在于充分发动群众，因地制宜地采取措施。本报今天发表的孟村湾管理区回茬麦增产经验就是一例。
    合理轮作　适时播种　选用良种　肥饱水足
    孟村湾管理区回茬麦连续四年增产
    介休县推广增产经验掀起多种种好回茬麦热潮
    据新华社讯　山西省介休县，因地制宜地推广了张兰公社孟村湾管理区回茬小麦四年连续获得增产的经验，保证多种、种好今年的回茬小麦。
    中共介休县委最近专门总结了孟村湾管理区回茬小麦连续四年增产的经验。这些经验是：实行轮作，适时播种，选用良种，肥饱水足。孟村湾管理区根据当地的具体条件，总结了群众中的固有经验，实行了有计划的合理轮作。变一年一收的耕作制度为一年两收。轮作的方法有三种：一种是四年六收，即第一年收小麦，回茬绿豆，收绿豆再种小麦；第二年收小麦，回茬谷子；第三年收高粱或甘薯；第四年收玉米，回茬小麦。一种是三年五收，即第一年收玉米，回茬小麦；第二年收小麦，回茬绿豆，收绿豆再种小麦；第三年收小麦，回茬谷子。再一种是三年四收，即第一年收玉米，回茬小麦；第二年收小麦，回茬谷子；第三年种高粱或甘薯。这三种办法的共同特点是：每三年到四年一块土地既可收获一到二季高产秋作物，又可以多收一到两季小秋作物。全部麦田在秋作物收获后，都能够抢上回茬小麦最好的瓜菜、绿豆和玉米茬。因为瓜菜茬施肥多，成熟早，省地力；绿豆茬给小麦生长留下了需要的根瘤菌；玉米茬虽然收获稍晚，但前茬追肥多，浇水足，水肥还可供小麦生长发育的需要。几年来由于掌握上述规律，因而使回茬小麦做到因茬、因时、因地制宜。
    这一带小麦最适时的播种期是“秋分”前后。孟村湾管理区由于实行了合理倒茬，把回茬小麦都播种在瓜菜、绿豆等早熟作物的土地上，因而一般都在“秋分”前后适时下种。此外，合理规划劳、畜力，对成熟较晚的玉米茬实行边收边种，保证了回茬小麦在“秋分”后十天下种，使回茬小麦有充分的时间发展根系，促进有效分蘖。
    他们还针对回茬小麦播种稍晚，分蘖少的问题，选用了成熟早、产量稳定，秆粗、叶壮、不倒伏，穗粗、穗大、籽粒饱的“蚂蚱麦”优良品种。为了做到肥饱水足，这个管理区共养猪一千二百六十头，光猪粪全年就积了四万七千多担，全部土地按二年三收计算，每次播种每亩可施猪粪二十八担，再加上人、畜粪尿和绿肥、秸秆肥等，底肥每亩平均达到六十担以上。这个管理区95％的土地可以用汾河水灌溉，每年可浇两次，促使前茬作物早熟，为适时播种小麦创造了良好的条件。
    目前，全县各人民公社通过广泛推广孟村湾管理区回茬小麦连年增产的经验，掀起了多种、种好回茬小麦的热潮。张兰、义安、城关等人民公社经过具体规划，把一万五千亩回茬小麦的任务落实到瓜菜、绿豆、玉米等前茬地块上。洪山人民公社为了促进两万亩小秋作物早熟，以保证小麦适时播种，最近组织了五千人的专业队，对小秋作物又普遍进行了加锄、加肥。全县各人民公社已为种回茬麦准备了各种底肥二千六百万担，每亩平均四十担。平川地区的八个人民公社相互调剂了“蚂蚱麦”、“中苏六八号”等优良品种二十一万多斤；山区的十三个人民公社都因地制宜的调剂了“北京十一号”、“四月黄”等生长期较短的小麦品种。
