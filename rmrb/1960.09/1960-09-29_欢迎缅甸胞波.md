　　Welcoming Burmese Compatriots
　　Guo Moruo

　　China and Burma have always been brothers,
　　Now our hearts shine together like the mountains and rivers.
　　Colonial suffering burdened us with shackles,
　　Anti-imperialism united us to escape the net.
　　Boundaries are settled between feasts and talks,
　　Clothing meets and friendship grows abundantly.
　　The flag of peaceful coexistence is held high,
　　The Five Principles will never be erased.

    *　In Burmese, "Paukphaw" means brothers, and China has always been called "the country of brothers."

　　欢迎缅甸胞波
　　郭沫若中缅由来是胞波，而今肝胆照山河。殖民受难蒙枷锁，反帝同心脱网罗。樽俎之间边界定，衣裳相会敦盘多。和平共处旗高举，原则五基永不磨。
    *　缅甸语“胞波”为兄弟，一向称中国为“胞波之国”。
