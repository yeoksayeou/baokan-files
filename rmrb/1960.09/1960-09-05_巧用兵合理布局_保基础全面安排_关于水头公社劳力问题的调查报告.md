Skillfully Use Troops, Reasonably Deploy, Guarantee the Foundation and Comprehensively Arrange
    ——Investigation Report on Labor Issues in the Shuitou Commune
    The CCP Committee of Wenxi County, Shanxi Province
    Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and it is also the foundation for people to carry out production and arrange their lives. Without the development of the foundation, other undertakings cannot be fully developed. Therefore, the whole party and the whole people should grasp agriculture, take agriculture as the center, and arrange the entire national economic plan from the perspective of serving agriculture. This is not only of practical significance, but also of long-term significance; it is not only of economic significance, but also of political significance. However, to fully develop agricultural production and truly reflect the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, we must start with the rational use of labor. Because labor is the fundamental problem for developing agricultural production, and it is the decisive factor in production. Especially before the realization of agricultural mechanization, the arrangement of labor becomes very important.
    Recently, the CCP Wenxi County Committee conducted an investigation on the use of labor in the Shuitou Commune. Through the investigation, we further realized that grasping labor and making reasonable arrangements, tapping the potential of labor, and using labor rationally are of decisive significance for promoting production development and ensuring the completion of production tasks. At the same time, it also makes us realize that there are indeed some contradictions in the current rural labor use that need to be resolved urgently. These contradictions are mainly manifested in: ① The contradiction between supporting national industry and developing commune-run economy and engaging in large-scale agricultural production; ② The contradiction between current production, especially field operations, and agricultural capital construction in the use of labor; ③ The contradiction between taking grain as the key link and developing diversified operations; ④ The further implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, with higher and more detailed requirements for field management levels, and the contradiction of excessive labor occupation; ⑤ The contradiction between the strong seasonality of summer and autumn, the high concentration of farm work, and the shortage of labor and uneven workload. All these aspects are the main contradictions in current agricultural production. The main symbol of solving these contradictions is to resolutely implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, mobilizing all walks of life to serve agricultural production, and ensuring the high-speed development of agricultural production. Because only with the high-speed development of agricultural production can we realize the policy of diversified operations, better develop commune-run industries, and correspondingly promote the development of finance, economy, culture, and health. At the same time, the development of these undertakings enriches the material strength to support agriculture, which in turn promotes the rapid development of agricultural production. This is a mutual promotion and cause-and-effect relationship. The key issue now is: on the one hand, the existing labor force must be rationally arranged; on the other hand, the potential of the labor force must be further tapped. If the arrangement is unreasonable, it will lead to improper use of force and cannot reflect the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation. If we are only satisfied with the current distribution of labor and do not tap the potential of more labor, high speed cannot appear, and the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation cannot be implemented. The two must be carried out simultaneously and cannot be neglected. The Shuitou People's Commune solved these problems in the case of heavy farm work, severe labor shortage, and many tasks but few people. The focus was accurate, the labor was used skillfully, and the potential was thoroughly tapped. Therefore, after suffering from severe drought, the average wheat yield per mu still reached 162 jin, which was slightly lower than last year, but still higher than the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Cotton and autumn management are well-organized, meticulously crafted, and carefully processed, so the entire crop grows well. At present, this commune is working hard to make all preparations for winning a large increase in wheat production next year.
    The Shuitou Commune is located in the west of Wenxi County, bordering Jiwang Mountain in the north and Mingtiao Ridge in the south. The Shushui River runs across the entire territory from east to west. It is an area with mountains, rivers, ridges, and ramparts. The entire commune has more than 166,600 mu of cultivated land, a population of more than 31,600 people, a labor force of 10,287 people, and 7,081 head of draught animals. On average, each person owns five mu of land, each laborer is responsible for 16 mu of cultivated land, and each animal is responsible for 22 mu. According to the requirements of this year's agricultural production, a total of 4.15 million workdays are required throughout the year, with an average of 400 workdays per laborer. However, according to the basic workdays reported by commune members, there are only 3.6 million, which is still 550,000 short. In addition, there are absences of some sick, weak, pregnant women, extra labor investment due to temporary natural disasters, and unplanned labor use for temporary rush tasks, which will make the problem even bigger. So what should we do? On this issue, there are two different views and two different attitudes among cadres and the masses: some people simply calculate from some ready-made figures, count dead accounts, and as a result, the problem becomes bigger and bigger. They advocate reducing the area of multiple cropping and reducing the amount of labor investment. Others, however, do not do so. They calculate living accounts, the more they calculate, the brighter their minds become, and the wider the method becomes. Their proposition is to skillfully use troops, use troops well, tap the potential of labor, mobilize labor enthusiasm, and improve labor efficiency, starting from a positive perspective to thoroughly solve the problem. After fully mobilizing the masses, extensively listening to opinions, and repeated discussions from top to bottom, eight effective measures were proposed to solve the labor problem. From the perspective of labor layout and labor use, it truly reflects the policy of "taking agriculture as the foundation" and provides a reliable guarantee for realizing "taking grain as the key link and developing diversified operations."

    Grasp Reasonable Arrangement and Improve the Utilization Rate of Labor
    The rational use of labor includes two meanings. First, the layout of all labor should be reasonably distributed and properly used. In the previous stage, there was indeed a phenomenon of decentralization in the use of labor, especially the labor force participating in field production only accounted for 55% of the total labor force at home, while other aspects accounted for 45%, which was obviously unreasonable. This is not only a problem of labor use, but also a question of understanding the policy of "taking agriculture as the foundation." It is related to the implementation of the policy of taking grain as the key link and developing diversified operations, and it is related to the high-speed and proportional development of the national economy. In view of this, the commune party committee, in accordance with the spirit of "urgency for what is urgent and slowness for what is slow", decisively adopted the effective methods of one compression (compressing 212 non-production personnel in the community), two merging (merging 14 factories with the same nature, squeezing out 165 laborers), three slowing down (slowing down 16 seasonal industrial and sideline production projects, freeing up 117 laborers), four suspending (suspending four infrastructure projects, freeing up 179 laborers), and five transfers (transferring 271 strong laborers from service, animal husbandry and other fronts), which greatly strengthened the first line of agricultural production, making service personnel from the original 13% reduced to 8.7% of the total labor force; animal husbandry personnel from 5.97% to 5.27%; agricultural capital construction team (water conservancy, water and soil conservation, afforestation) from 9.8% to 5%; industrial and sideline production personnel from 7.08% to 2.9%, and the number of people directly participating in field production increased from the original 55% to 78% of the total labor force, of which 5,638 were strong laborers, accounting for 75% of the personnel participating in field production. That is to say, from the perspective of quantity and quality, it reflects the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation.
    Secondly, the use of each laborer should be based on personal preferences and expertise, in the premise of not affecting the overall arrangement, use talents according to their aptitude and assign jobs according to their ability. In this way, we can give full play to their skills, improve work efficiency, and achieve twice the result with half the effort. Although the commune party committee and management district cadres were also aware of this problem, they lacked experience, which led to some people being assigned to jobs that did not match their skills, and some people who were good at crafts and skills were assigned to heavy work; and the roles of some people with technical expertise were not fully utilized. The commune party committee adopted the method of "dissecting sparrows", went to Xingnan, Shuitou, Xiachao and other three management districts with better labor use, conducted investigations, and convened old farmers for discussions, summarized the experience, and carried out a movement of using talents according to their aptitude and adjusting farm work in the whole commune, and has achieved remarkable results. According to incomplete statistics, since this spring, a total of 363 chefs who are politically reliable and love the canteen have been transferred in; 150 animal keepers who love animals and are familiar with feeding work have been transferred in; 370 people who are suitable for heavy work have been transferred from the cotton and autumn management team and melon and fruit orchards to agricultural capital construction teams such as digging weirs, laying foundations, water conservancy, and deep ploughing. A total of 729 people with technical expertise were assigned to professional teams such as melon, fruit, vegetable garden, factory, workshop, and technical crop management. The whole commune adjusted a total of 2,612 people in terms of using talents according to their aptitude, accounting for 25% of the total labor force. This did not affect the overall arrangement of the labor force, but greatly gave play to everyone's expertise and mobilized the enthusiasm for labor. The vast number of commune members happily said: "This is like a dragon returning to the sea, a fish leaping into the abyss, let go and do it openly!" After Xingnan Village implemented the use of talents according to their aptitude and adjusted the labor force, the old man Wang Gengmao praised it endlessly and said, "It's really like using troops like a god." The old man Gao Wenhuan, a commune member of the 15th team of Xiachao Management District, has the technology of growing melons and vegetables, and he also likes to play with melons and vegetables, but he was assigned other jobs, and some novices were assigned to grow melons and vegetables. During the rectification campaign this spring, the old man posted a big-character poster to the captain saying: "The captain assigns work improperly, not asking commune members what their specialties are. He has been growing vegetables and melons for half his life, but he insists on calling me to grow cotton." When adjusting farm work, the old man's requirements were met. The old man's enthusiasm was particularly high. He worked hard day and night and never left the fields. The four mu of watermelons he planted earned 1,800 yuan. He also intercropped vegetables in the melon fields, and is preparing to plant wheat in the vegetable fields, without delaying the return of the wheat fields to the team. The old man Huang Shenlu in Dazhang District loves to take care of animals. After becoming a breeder, he fed the twelve animals until they were fat and strong, all rated as first-class fat. And he learned how to breed and treat simple diseases for livestock.
    In order to ensure the full attendance of women, they also stipulated: "Strong women plant far away and do formal work, and women with tired children plant near and do odd jobs."
    Livestock power was also planned to make people and animals matched, and livestock and tools matched.

    Tap the Potential of Labor and Increase Troops and Generals for Agriculture
    1. Run collective welfare undertakings well and tap the potential of women's labor. Women have become an indispensable labor force on the production front, but in the past, because collective welfare undertakings were poorly run, there were many women who were not liberated from housework for a period of time, and their attendance was not frequent. Last year, women's attendance only accounted for 65% of the total, and the average labor days per person only reached 150. After the commune party committee discovered this situation, it greatly strengthened the leadership of collective welfare undertakings, ran people's public canteens on a large scale, and ran nurseries and kindergartens on a large scale, making 216 canteens, 77 nurseries, and 62 kindergartens in the whole commune very well. The number of people entering the canteens increased from 35% in this spring to 99% now. The number of children entering nurseries and kindergartens increased from 1,300 to 2,864, thus freeing up 1,800 women laborers to participate in production, making the women's attendance rate often maintained at 85%, and many women achieved full attendance every month. In the past six months, each woman has worked an average of 93 labor days, an increase of 20% compared with the same period last year.
    2. Give full play to the role of auxiliary labor. The working people have the habit of loving labor. Even the elderly always ask for something to do as long as they can move. In this regard, the commune party committee has made careful plans, using talents according to their aptitude and setting things according to people. For example, old men who have experience in farming and can grow economic crops are assigned to plough the land, grow vegetables, and manage cotton. Old women who are gentle and love children are assigned to be nannies and take care of children, so as to free up women to participate in production. People who are not good at running can not run, but they can feed livestock; people with poor eyesight can shake waterwheels and tread windmills. In this way, all 1,309 auxiliary laborers in the whole commune are mobilized to participate in production. They happily said: "I didn't expect that we people still have great use."
    3. Organize employees of various units in the market town to participate in field production in their spare time to support agriculture. There are 966 cadres and employees of various organs, enterprises, factories and mines, 1,770 students above junior high school, and 70 teachers in the whole commune. According to the spirit of workers, transportation, commerce, students, and soldiers coming to support agriculture together and combining education with productive labor, the commune party committee made a comprehensive plan, organized units to cooperate with district teams, and regularly performed labor. If an employee works three days a month and teachers and students work half a day a week, the whole commune can do 84,000 labor days.
    4. Carry out tool reform on a large scale. With the continuous development of production, the commune party committee has long put forward the slogan: "Reform tools to engage in production, one person can top several people", and set off a climax of large-scale tool reform. The whole commune has reformed more than 30 kinds of tools, reaching more than 7,000 pieces, and the efficiency has increased by one to three times, saving more than 1,000 laborers. For example, in Xingnan Management District, three teams were originally needed for middle tillage, with three processes, namely: the first process of harrowing once, the second process of shallow ploughing, and the third process of small harrowing to break the soil. After mobilizing the masses to contribute ideas and suggestions, a harrow was added in front of the plough and a small harrow was brought behind, realizing the integration of three in one, and only one team was needed. Both saving labor and improving work efficiency have reached two times.

    Comprehensive Utilization of Labor, Advocate One Person with Multiple Skills
    The potential of labor is endless, but this is not only a matter of the number of people, but also to engage in large-scale comprehensive utilization of labor and improve the utilization rate of labor. Their method is:
    Commune-run industrial and sideline economy, except for a few factories that are directly related to agricultural production and insist on running factories all year round, the rest are based on the spirit of "working and farming", running factories in slack seasons and stopping in busy seasons, and participating in agricultural production. For example, during the anti-drought period, 18 factories, enterprises, and institutions in the whole commune extracted 410 people and invested in anti-drought.
    Breeders originally did not care about carrying water, removing circles, chopping green grass, or pulling circle soil. In fact, breeders can do these things by the way, and there is no need to send someone else to do them. After large-scale comprehensive utilization, breeders have taken on these things related to breeding. In the past six months, the whole commune has saved 5,300 workdays, and it does not affect the breeding work. Some breeders also took the time to participate in field labor in turn.
    Canteen managers partially serve as cooks and custodians, cooks also manage raising chickens, feeding pigs, and picking vegetables, and can also be combined with flour processors. This is also convenient for life adjustment. For example, what kind of noodles are needed in the canteen, whether they are coarse, fine, bean noodles, miscellaneous noodles, or jade dumplings, they can be solved at any time, which is also good for improving meals.
    Obstetric hospitals also have potential. For example, pregnant women can do some odd jobs before and after childbirth, such as sewing and mending, and raising poultry. The elderly in nursing homes can also be assigned some agricultural work within their ability according to the situation.
    Promote Li Tianzhu's experience, do not pass the time in vain, and do not walk the road in vain, calling on free people to carry manure when they go out of the village and carry baskets of vegetables when they return to the village. According to preliminary statistics, in the past six months, a total of 510,000 loads of manure and 320,000 jin of vegetables were carried by foot alone.

    Arrange Seasonal Stubble and Adjust Farm Work Idle and Busy
    Agricultural production is the most seasonal science, but the work is uneven, sometimes tight and sometimes loose; this brings great difficulties to the use of labor, especially in the summer and autumn harvest seasons, farm work is highly concentrated, and labor is overwhelmed. With a little carelessness, one will lose sight of the other. To solve this contradiction, in addition to rational arrangement, we must appropriately disperse farm work, stagger the stubble of crops, and advance or postpone some farm work. The specific methods are: ① From the perspective of crop varieties, adjust the seasonal stubble. Especially during the summer harvest, the problem is even bigger. People often say: "When silkworms are old for a day, wheat is ripe for a moment", and overnight there will be "spring wind blowing yellow thousands of acres of waves". And this is also a wheat producing area, how to be foolproof in this season of "grabbing food from the dragon's mouth", according to past experience and specific circumstances, they planted three kinds of wheat varieties with different maturity periods to avoid excessive concentration of farm work during the wheat harvest period. In the eleven hilly areas with more wheat fields in the whole commune, there are more than 40,000 mu of wheat fields, of which 2,300 mu are planted with early-maturing Baishan wheat, 37,800 mu with general-maturing Bima No. 1 and No. 4, and 3,200 mu with late-maturing Baixian wheat and ZaoYang wheat, which adjusted the farm work stubble. ② In terms of autumn crops, engage in large-scale late autumn intercropping and nutrient bowl seedling cultivation. In the autumn crops of the whole commune, there are 3,272 mu of early autumn, 31,940 mu of late autumn, and 1,750 mu of intercropping autumn, which also divides the maturity period of autumn crops into three batches. Moreover, autumn field intercropping and cotton seedling cultivation promoted early maturity of crops, which is conducive to the return of wheat fields to the team and avoids crowding of farm work. ③ In terms of crop planting arrangement, different plans were also made according to different regions. For example, in irrigated areas, where there are many people and little land and sufficient water and fertilizer, the replanting area is required to reach more than 90%, and more high-yielding crops should be planted. In hilly areas, where there are few people and vast land and lack of water and fertilizer, it is required to appropriately reduce some replanting, replanting accounting for 20%-30% of wheat fields, and plant more crops such as mung beans and peas that require less labor. Moreover, the rhizobia of beans can also top fertilizer, solving the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer in hilly areas. ④ Make full use of the slack gaps in farming, do the farming work that can be done before the busy season in advance, and strive to take a step forward. Be early in everything. As a result, there was dry work in winter and spring, and dry work in summer and autumn. For example, at the mouth of the wheat harvest this year, 32,000 mu of cotton fields in the whole commune were generally inspected for seedlings and weeds, of which 6,100 mu were sprayed with 666 agents once to prevent the occurrence of pests. Therefore, during the tense wheat harvest period, all commune members were able to concentrate their efforts on the summer harvest without "worries". During this summer field management period, they not only applied base fertilizer to 62,000 mu of idle wheat fields in the whole commune, but also delivered the fertilizer needed for 48,000 mu of wheat fields to the fields... Similar examples are too numerous to mention. In short, everything is one step ahead.

    Comprehensive Planning and Reasonable Layout
    The situation of fragmented land caused by feudal separatism and small-scale peasant economy in our country for thousands of years has long been completely changed, but the remaining traces still exist. For example, the meandering of waterways, the interspersion of land, and the winding of field roads, etc., affect the development of production to varying degrees. If this situation is not completely changed, it will cause waste of labor and will not be compatible with the current large-scale production. In order to save more labor, the commune conducted comprehensive planning and reasonable layout: ① Adjust the old waterways, change the unreasonable water regulations, and change the 35 large and small canals that flow unreasonably due to the limitations of administrative divisions and business scope to a trunk canal with the construction of square fields based on the principles of local subordination to the whole, small interests subordinate to large interests, and reasonable water use and water saving, planning to rebuild it into a trunk canal, With twelve branch canals, it not only reduces the consumption of water, but also achieves comprehensive utilization, accelerates the flow rate, expands the irrigation area by more than 7,500 mu, and greatly saves labor. For example, originally, due to the unreasonable flow direction of the canal and too many bends, several people were needed to watch the water when watering, but now one person is enough. Xixiachao alone saved 3,250 workdays during the summer watering this year. ② Adjust the interspersed land. Although it was adjusted after communization, it was not thorough. Xixiachao, Xiaozhang and other eleven management districts interspersed planting, and there were also 4,500 mu of land interspersed into the heart of other district teams, which cost about 8,000 workdays for round trips every year. After the adjustment, the land is contiguous, the farming is convenient, and the labor is greatly saved. ③ With the further implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter", the amount of fertilizer application is constantly increasing, and the amount of transportation is correspondingly increased. According to preliminary estimates, the man-days for transporting fertilizer generally account for 20%-25% of the total man-days, especially in remote areas. The most remote cultivated land in Shehujian Management District is six or seven miles away, and the land is over three ridges and two trenches. A strong laborer can only deliver six loads of fertilizer a day. If the fertilizer application per mu is 60 loads, it will take ten workdays. It can be seen that the potential for transporting fertilizer is very large. The commune party committee adopted the method of "livestock down to the fields, using livestock to cultivate the fields" in the layout, especially during the busy farming season, raising livestock, using livestock, and accumulating fertilizer on the spot for some remote areas and square fields; in hilly areas, engaging in large-scale weir-cutting and foundation-building to accumulate and sweep road soil, accumulating fertilizer in the fields, and applying it on the spot to reduce the man-days for fertilizer transportation. This is not only a fundamental measure to transform remote and barren land, but also an effective way to save labor. In addition, continuous crop planting was carried out to facilitate cultivation and reduce round trips; threshing floors were built in the fields; grain warehouses were built in villages along major transportation routes; which also saved a lot of labor.

    Organize Collaboration and Mutual Support
    Due to the differences in water and drought areas and the number of labor, the width of the land, and the conditions such as the early and late maturity of crops, there is also a temporary imbalance of labor sometimes loose and sometimes tight, which brings the possibility of large-scale collaboration between regions. In this year's anti-drought, in order to seize the season and plant early, the irrigated areas set off a climax of rushing to harvest, rush to irrigate, and rush to plant. At the same time, it is also necessary to carry out the processing and management of cotton fields and early autumn, and there is a shortage of labor everywhere. However, in dry land areas, due to drought and dry land, there is less farming work, so the commune organized 1,300 laborers and 580 livestock from eight dry land areas to support irrigated areas. In order to jointly overcome the disaster with dry land areas, the irrigated areas gave out 500 mu of water land for dry land areas to cultivate free of charge. During the fallow cultivation period, due to the large replanting area in water land and the small fallow wheat land, the fallow cultivation task was small, so labor and livestock power were extracted to support the dry land area for fallow cultivation. This organic combination and interweaving between regions not only tapped the potential of labor, but also promoted the communist style of helping each other in the same boat, enabling people to establish a collectivist spirit and demonstrating the superiority of the socialist system.

    Grasp Ideological Education and Improve the Labor Consciousness of the Masses
    While tapping the potential of labor, we must also pay great attention to doing a good job in the ideological work of people, because people are the most active factor in production, and people are governed by thoughts. Based on this basic principle, the Shuitou Commune Party Committee grasped education with agriculture as the foundation and love for the community, improved the ideological awareness of commune members, and established the sense of ownership. At the same time, it carried out five-love labor competitions, evaluated the amount of attendance, evaluated the quality of work, and evaluated compliance with labor discipline. For example, Xingnan District implemented a labor day rise and fall table, which was announced every five days, thereby greatly improving the labor attendance rate. The third team in this district has a total of 63 laborers. In the first five days, only 45 people attended work, with an average of 8.34 work points per person per day, the highest being 13 points and the lowest being 3.5 points. After carrying out evaluation and announcing labor days, the number of labor attendance in the second five days increased to 58 people, with an average of 9.48 work points per person per day, the highest being 16.4 points and the lowest being 6 points. The commune member Li Jinxi did not work much in the past, and only worked two shifts in the first five days. After carrying out education and implementing evaluation, there was no absence for 100 days. The work of Caozhang Management District was not advanced at first. In the anti-drought struggle, the enthusiasm of the masses for labor was greatly inspired by calculating the family's assets, time, and income, which increased the attendance rate from 75% to 97%.
    Although the above achievements have been made, the commune party committee feels that the potential of labor is still very large. For example, there is still an excessive phenomenon of occupying labor in forest farms, small farms...commune-run enterprises and institutions; cadres at the commune and district levels who can be transferred down have not been completely transferred down. According to the spirit of "combining farming and study", agricultural middle schools and private middle schools still have potential to be tapped. Technological innovation and technological revolution have not been carried out enough and have not formed a mass movement. Now, on the basis of the previous stage of victory, the commune party committee is determined to vigorously allocate labor, tap potential, strengthen the first line of agricultural production, earnestly implement the policy of agriculture as the foundation, and ensure a large increase in agricultural production.

    巧用兵合理布局　保基础全面安排
    ——关于水头公社劳力问题的调查报告
    中共山西省闻喜县委会
    农业是国民经济的基础，也是人们进行生产、安排生活的基础。基础不发展，其他事业也不能得到充分的发展。为此，全党全民抓农业，以农业为中心，一切从服务农业出发，来安排整个国民经济计划，既有现实意义，又有长远意义；既有经济意义，又有政治意义。但是要充分发展农业生产，真正体现农业为基础的方针，就必须从合理使用劳力入手。因为劳动力是发展农业生产的根本问题，是生产中起决定作用的因素。尤其在农业实现机械化之前，劳动力的安排问题，就显得十分重要。
    最近，中共闻喜县委在水头公社对于劳动力的使用问题，进行了一次调查。通过调查，使我们进一步认识到大抓劳力合理布局，大挖劳动力潜力，合理使用劳力，对于促进生产的发展，保证生产任务的完成，具有决定性的意义。同时，也使我们认识到当前农村在劳力使用上，确实存在着一些急待解决的矛盾，这些矛盾主要表现在：①支援国家工业和发展社办经济与大搞农业生产的矛盾；②当前生产，特别是田间作业与农业基本建设在劳力使用上的矛盾；③以粮为纲与发展多种经营的矛盾；④农业“八字宪法”的进一步贯彻，田间管理水平要求愈高愈细与占用劳力过多的矛盾；⑤夏秋季节性强，农活高度集中与劳力不足，忙闲不均的矛盾。所有这些方面，就是当前农业生产上的主要矛盾。解决这些矛盾的主要标志，就是坚决贯彻以农业为基础的方针，调动各行各业，为农业生产服务，保证农业生产的高速度发展。因为只有农业生产高速度发展了，才能实现多种经营的方针，才能更好地发展社办工业和相应地促进财经、文化、卫生工作的发展。同时这些事业的发展，充实了支援农业的物质力量，反转来又促进了农业生产的迅速发展，这是相互推动，互为因果的。现在的关键问题是：一方面对现有劳力要进行合理安排；一方面要进一步挖掘劳动力的潜力。如果安排不合理，就会造成力量使用失当，不能体现以农业为基础的方针。如果只满足于现有劳力的分布，而不去挖掘更多的劳动力的潜力，就不可能出现高速度，同样不能贯彻农业为基础的方针，二者必须同时并举，不可偏废。水头人民公社在农活繁重、劳力奇缺、事多人少的情况下，解决了这些问题。重点抓得准，劳力用得巧，潜力挖得透，因而在遭受严重干旱之后，小麦亩产还平均达到一百六十二斤，虽较去年略低，但比大跃进的1958年还有所增产。棉秋管理，井井有序，精雕细刻，细致加工，因而整个作物生长良好。目前这个公社正在干劲冲天地为夺取明年小麦大增产进行着一切准备工作。
    水头公社位于闻喜县西部，北依稷王山，南连鸣条岗，涑水河由东而西，横贯全境，是一个山、川、岭、垣兼有地带。全社共有耕地十六万六千六百多亩，人口三万一千六百多人，劳力一万零二百八十七个，耕畜七千零八十一头，平均每人占有土地五亩，每个劳力负担耕地十六亩，每个牲畜负担二十二亩。按照今年农业生产的要求，全年共需四百一十五万个工，平均每个劳力需做四百个工，而按照社员所报的基本劳动日只有三百六十万个，还相差五十五万个，再加上一些病弱孕产妇的缺勤和临时遭受自然灾害的额外投工，以及临时突击任务的计划以外用工，那就问题更大了。那么怎么办呢？对于这个问题，在干部群众中有两种不同的见解、两种不同的态度：一种人，单纯从一些现成的数字上，死算账，算死账，结果问题越算越大。他们主张减少复播面积，减少投工数量。另一种人则不然，他们活算账，算活账，越算头脑越亮，办法愈宽阔。他们的主张是巧用兵，用好兵，大挖劳动力潜力，调动劳动积极性，提高劳动效率，从积极方面着眼，彻底解决问题。经过充分发动群众，广泛听取意见，上上下下，反复讨论，提出八项有力措施，解决了劳力问题。从劳力布局与劳力使用上，真正体现了以“农业为基础”的方针，为实现“以粮为纲，发展多种经营”，提供了可靠的保证。
    大抓合理安排，提高劳动力的使用率
    劳动力的合理使用，包括两个含义，首先对于全部劳力的布局要分布的合理，使用的得当。前段在劳力使用上确实有分散主义现象，尤其参加田间生产的劳力仅占在家总劳力的55％，而在其他方面则占用了45％，显然是不合理的。这不仅是劳动力的使用问题，而且是对于以“农业为基础”的方针的认识问题。关系到以粮为纲，发展多种经营方针的执行问题，关系到国民经济高速度按比例的发展问题。公社党委有鉴于此，根据“急其所急，缓其所缓”的精神，当机立断，采取了一压（压缩社区非生产人员二百一十二人）、二并（合并了十四个性质相同的厂子，挤出劳力一百六十五人）、三缓（缓办了十六项季节性的工业副业生产项目，腾出劳力一百一十七人）、四停（暂停了四项基建工程，腾出劳力一百七十九人）、五抽调（从服务、畜牧等战线上抽调强壮劳力二百七十一人）的有效办法，大大加强了农业生产第一线，使服务业人员由原来的13％减到占总劳力的8.7％；畜牧业人员由5.97％减为5.27％；农业基本建设队（水利、水保、造林）由9.8％减为5％；工业副业生产人员由7.08％减为2.9％，而直接参加田间生产的人员则由原来的55％，增加到占总劳力的78％，其中强壮劳力达五千六百三十八人，占田间参加生产人员的75％。这就是说：从数量和质量上，都体现了以农业为基础的方针。
    其次对每一个劳力的使用，要在不影响通盘安排的前提下，根据个人所好与特长，因材使用，因人给事，这样做，可以发挥一技之长，提高做活效率，收到事半功倍之效。原来公社党委和管理区干部虽然也意识到了这个问题，但缺乏经验，以致造成一部分人学非所用，作非所能，把一些适于做出力活的人，分配了手艺、把式活；把一些善于做手艺、把式活的人，分配了笨重活计；对一部分有技术专长的人，也没有充分发挥他们的作用。公社党委采取了“解剖麻雀”的办法，到兴南、水头、下晁等三个劳力使用较好的管理区，进行了调查，并召集老农进行了座谈，总结了经验，在全社范围内，广泛开展了因材用人，调整农活运动，并已取得显著成绩。据不完全统计，今春以来，共调进政治可靠，热爱食堂的做饭把式三百六十三人；调进爱抚弄牲口，熟悉饲养工作的饲养员一百五十人；有三百七十个适于做出力活的人，从棉秋管理队伍中，以及瓜地果园调到了切堰垫地、水利、深耕等农业基本建设队伍中。有七百二十九个有技术专长的人，分别被派到瓜果、菜园、工厂、作坊、技术作物管理等专业队伍中。全社在因材用人方面一共调整了二千六百一十二人，占总劳力的25％。这样作，并没有影响整个劳力的安排，而是大大发挥了每个人的专长，调动了劳动积极性。广大社员高兴地说：“这一下龙归大海，鱼跃深渊，放开脚步敞开的干吧！”兴南庄实行因材用人，调整劳力以后，王庚卯老汉赞叹不已地说“真是用兵如神”。下晁管理区十五队社员高文焕老汉，有种瓜种菜的技术，而且也爱拨弄瓜菜，但分派了别的活计，而种瓜菜的却派了些生手。今春整风期间，老汉给队长贴了个大字报说：“队长派活不适当，不问社员啥特长，种了半辈子菜和瓜，偏偏叫我种棉花。”在调整农活时，满足了老汉的要求，老汉情绪特别高涨，日日夜夜辛勤劳动，整天不离田间，种的四亩西瓜，收入一千八百元。他又在瓜地套种了蔬菜，还准备在菜地种麦子，不误麦田归队。大张区黄申禄老汉，爱抚弄牲口，当了饲养员后，把十二头牲口喂得滚瓜流油，膘肥体壮，全部评为一类膘。并且学会了配种和给牲口医治简单的疾病。
    为保证妇女全勤，他们还规定：“强壮妇女种远地，做正活，有累手孩子的妇女种近地，做零活”。
    对于畜力，也进行了规划，作到人畜配套，牲口与工具配套。
    挖掘劳动力潜力，给农业增兵添将
    一、办好集体福利事业，挖掘妇女劳动力潜力。妇女在生产战线上，已经成为一支不可缺少的劳动大军，但是以前由于集体福利事业搞得较差，所以有一个时期有不少妇女没有从家务劳动中解放出来，出勤不经常。去年全年妇女出勤仅占65％，平均每人做劳动日仅达一百五十个。公社党委发现了这个情况之后，便大大加强了集体福利事业的领导，大办全民性的公共食堂，大办托儿所、幼儿园，使全社二百一十六个食堂，七十七个托儿所，六十二个幼儿园办得很好，入食堂人数由今春的35％增加到现在的99％。入托儿所和幼儿园的孩子由一千三百人增加到二千八百六十四人，从而又腾出妇女劳力一千八百人参加了生产，使妇女出勤率经常保持到85％，不少妇女做到月月不缺勤。半年来平均每个妇女做劳动日九十三个，比去年同期提高20％。
    二、充分发挥辅助劳力的作用。劳动人民都有爱好劳动的习惯，即是老年人，只要能动弹，他们也总是要求找点活干。在这方面，公社党委作了周密的规划，因材用人，因人设事。如老汉耕地有经验，会种经济作物，就分配他们犁地、种菜、管棉花，老婆婆性情温和、爱孩子，就分配她们当保姆，看孩子，以便腾出妇女参加生产。腿脚不俐落的人不能跑路，但可以喂牲口；眼力不好的人可以摇水车，踩风车，这样就使全社一千三百零九个辅助劳力都动员起来，参加了生产。他们高兴地说：“想不到我们这些人还有大用。”
    三、组织集镇上各单位职工，利用业余时间，参加田间生产，支援农业。全社共有各机关、企业、厂矿干部、职工九百六十六人，高小以上学生一千七百七十人，教员七十人，根据工、交、商、学、兵一齐来支援农业和教育与生产劳动相结合的精神，公社党委作了全面规划，组织单位与区队挂钩协作，定期劳动。如果一个职工每月劳动以三天计，教员学生每星期劳动半天，全社共可做劳动日八万四千个。
    四、大搞工具改革。随着生产的不断发展，公社党委早就提出了：“改革工具搞生产，一人可顶数人干”的口号，掀起了大搞工具改革的高潮。全社共改革各种工具三十多种，达七千余件，工效提高一至三倍，共节省劳力达千余个。如兴南管理区，原来中耕需三套人马，经三道工序，即：第一道刀耙一遍，第二道浅犁，第三道小耘碎土，经发动群众献计献策后，将犁前边加刀耙，后边带小耱，实行了三合一，只用一套人马就行了。节省劳力提高工效都达两倍。
    综合利用劳动力，提倡一人多艺
    劳动力的潜力是无穷无尽的，但这不只是人的数量问题，而且要大搞劳力综合利用，提高劳动力的使用率。他们的办法是：
    社办工业副业经济，除个别与农业生产有直接关系的坚持常年办厂外，其余本着“亦工亦农”的精神，农闲则办，农忙则停，参加农业生产。如抗旱中，全社就有十八个工厂企业事业单位，抽出四百一十人，投入抗旱。
    饲养员原来不管担水，不管除圈，不管铡青草，不管拉垫圈土。其实这些活，饲养员都能捎带着干，不需要另派人去干。在大搞综合利用后，饲养员把这些与饲养有关的事，都担当起来了。半年来全社就省工五千三百个，也并不影响饲养工作。有些饲养员还抽空轮流参加了田间劳动。
    食堂管理员部分兼任炊事员、保管员，炊事员兼管养鸡、喂猪、拣菜，还可与面粉加工员相结合，这也便于生活调剂，如食堂需要什么面，不管是粗的、细的、豆面、杂面、玉茭瓣等都可随时解决，这对改善伙食，也有好处。
    妇产院也有潜力，如产妇在产前产后都可作些零活，如缝缝补补，饲养家禽。对敬老院的老人们也可根据情况，分派一些力所能及的农活。
    推广李天柱经验，时不空过，路不空行，号召空人出村捎担粪，回村捎篮菜。据初步统计，光捎脚这一项，半年共捎粪五十一万担，捎菜三十二万斤。
    安排季节茬口，调剂农活闲忙
    农业生产是季节性最强的一门科学，但是忙闲不均，时紧时松；这就给劳力使用带来极大困难，尤其夏收秋收季节，农活高度集中，劳力应付不暇，稍有疏忽，就会顾此失彼。要解决这个矛盾，除合理安排外，必须适当分散农活，使作物错开茬口，把一部分农活赶前或推后。其具体作法是：①从作物品种上，调开季节茬口。特别是夏收期间，问题更大，人常说：“蚕老一日，麦熟一时”，一夜之隔就会出现“春风吹黄千顷浪”。而这里又是麦产区，如何在这个“龙口夺食”的季节里，作到万无一失，他们根据历年经验和具体情况，种植了成熟期不同的三种小麦品种，以避免麦收期的农活过分集中。全社麦田较多的十一个丘岭地区，共有麦田四万多亩，其中种植了成熟较早的白山麦二千三百亩，成熟一般的碧玛一号、四号三万七千八百亩，成熟较迟的白线麦、早洋麦三千二百亩，这就调开了农活茬口。②在秋作物方面，大搞晚秋套种和营养钵育苗，这在全社秋作物中，有早秋三千二百七十二亩，有晚秋三万一千九百四十亩，套种秋一千七百五十亩，把秋作物的成熟期也分成三批。而且秋田套种，棉花育苗，促进了作物早熟，有利于麦田归队，避免了农活拥挤。③在作物种植安排上，也根据不同地区作了不同规划。如水浇田地区，人多地少，水肥充足，要求复插面积达90％以上，而且要多种高产作物。丘岭地带人少地广，水肥俱缺，要求适当少复播一些，复播占麦田20％—30％，并要多种些费工小的绿豆、豌豆之类的作物，而且豆类的根瘤菌还可以顶肥料，解决丘岭地肥料不足的困难。④充分利用农闲空隙，把在大忙前可以做的农活提前做好，力争赶前一步，一早百早，争取主动。做到冬干春活，夏干秋活。如今年麦收口里，全社三万二千亩棉田，普遍进行了检苗锄草，其中有六千一百亩喷打了一次六六六药剂，防治了虫害发生。所以在紧张的麦收期间，全体社员能够集中力量搞夏收，无“后顾之忧”。在这段夏田管理期间，他们不光对全社六万二千亩休闲麦田施了底肥，而且四万八千亩准备归队的麦田所需要的肥料，也送到地头，……诸如此类，不胜枚举。总之一切赶前一步。
    全面规划，合理布局
    我国几千年来由于封建割据以及小农经济所造成的土地支离破碎的状况，早已彻底改观，但遗留下来的残余痕迹仍然存在。如水路弯曲，土地插花，田间道路迂回等，不同程度地影响着生产的发展。如不彻底改变这种状况，就会造成劳力上的浪费，而且与目前的大生产不相适应。为了节省更多的劳力，公社进行了全面规划，合理布局：①调整旧有水路，改变不合理的水规，将受行政区划和经营范围限制而流向不合理的三十五条大小渠道，本着局部服从整体，小利益服从大利益，以及合理用水，节约用水的原则随着方田的建设，规划改建为一条干渠，十二条支渠，既减少了水量的消耗，又作到综合利用，加快流速，扩大浇地面积七千五百余亩，并且大大节省了劳力。如原来由于渠道流向不合理，弯度太多太大，浇水时需要几个人看水，而现在一个人就行了。仅西下晁一个管理区，在今年夏浇期间，就节约了三千二百五十个工。②调整插花地。公社化后虽也调整了一下，但不彻底。西下晁、小张等十一个管理区交插种地，并且还有插进别区别队心脏地区的土地四千五百余亩，每年往返费工约计八千余个。经过调整后，土地连片，耕作方便，大大节约了用工。③随着“八字宪法”的进一步贯彻，施肥量的不断增加，相应地增加了运输量。据初步估计，一年运肥用工一般占总用工量的20％—25％，特别是远地用工量更大。蛇虎涧管理区耕地最远的六、七华里，上地翻三条岭二道沟，强劳力一天仅能送肥六担，亩施肥以六十担计，就需十个工，这就可以看出，在运送肥料上，潜力是很大的。公社党委在布局上采取了“六畜下田，以畜就田”的办法，特别是在农忙时，对一些远地和方田，就地饲养，就地使役，就地积肥；在丘岭地带，大搞切堰垫地积扫路土，田间积肥，就地施用，减少肥料运送工。这不仅是改造远地薄地的一项根本措施，而且也是节约劳力的一条有效办法。此外还进行了作物连片种植，便利耕作，减少往返；田间建立打麦场；交通要道村子建粮仓；也节约了不少的劳力。
    组织协作，互相支援
    由于水旱地区的不同和劳力多寡、土地宽狭、庄稼成熟迟早等条件的不同，也就出现了劳力时松时紧的暂时不平衡现象，这也给地区之间的大协作带来了可能性。在今年抗旱中，水浇田地区为了夺取节令，赶前下种，掀起了抢收、抢浇、抢种高潮。同时还要进行棉田和早秋的加工管理，处处呈现劳力不足。而旱田地区，由于天旱地干，农活较少，公社就组织了八个旱田地区的一千三百个劳力，五百八十个牲口支援水浇田地区，水浇田地区为同旱田地区共同度过灾荒，无偿地让出五百亩水地，叫旱田地区耕种。在伏耕期间，由于水地复播面积大，休闲麦地少，伏耕任务小，于是，又抽出劳畜力支援旱田地区进行伏耕。这种地区间的有机结合，穿插进行，不仅挖掘了劳动力的潜力，而且也发扬了同舟共济的共产主义风格，使人们树立了集体主义精神，显示了社会主义制度的优越性。
    大抓思想教育，提高群众劳动自觉性
    在大挖劳动力潜力的同时，还必须十分注意作好人的思想工作，因为人是生产中最活跃的因素，而人又是受着思想支配的。水头公社党委根据这一基本原理，大抓以农业为基础和爱社教育，提高社员思想觉悟，树立主人翁思想。同时开展五爱日劳动竞赛，评出勤多少，评做活质量，评遵守劳动纪律。如兴南区实行劳动日升降表，五天一公布，从而大大提高了劳动出勤率。这个区的第三队共有劳力六十三人，第一个五天出勤仅四十五人，平均每人每天得劳动工分8.34分，最高的13分，最低的3.5分。经开展评比，公布劳动日后，第二个五天的劳动出勤人数增加到五十八人，每人每天平均得劳动工分9.48分，最高的达16.4分，最低的也有6分。社员李锦秀过去不多劳动，前五天仅做活两晌，开展教育与实行评比后，百日无缺勤。曹张管理区的工作本来不先进，在抗旱斗争中，通过算家底账、时间账、收入账，大大启发了群众的劳动积极性，使出勤率由75％增加到97％。
    虽然取得了上述成绩，但公社党委感到劳力的潜力仍然很大。如林场、小农场……社办企业事业单位，仍有占用劳力过多现象；社、区两级干部，能下放的，还没有完全放下去。农业中学、民办中学根据“耕读并举”的精神，还有潜力可挖。技术革新与技术革命开展得很不够，没有形成群众运动。现在公社党委正在前段胜利的基础上，决心大力调配劳力，大挖潜力，加强农业生产第一线，认真贯彻农业为基础的方针，确保农业大增产。
