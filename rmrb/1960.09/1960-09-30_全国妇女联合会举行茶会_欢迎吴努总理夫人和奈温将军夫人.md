Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: The All-China Women's Federation held a tea party this afternoon at the Peace Hotel to warmly welcome Premier U Nu's wife and General Ne Win's wife, as well as the female members of the Burmese trade, cultural, and other delegations visiting our country. Through them, the deepest friendship and kinship-like greetings of Chinese women were conveyed to Burmese women.

The tea party was presided over by Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation.

Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, spoke at the meeting. She first expressed a warm welcome to the distinguished guests. She said that the people of China and Burma are not only friends but also "Pauk-Phaw" (siblings), friends and relatives, which is truly adding joy to joy and making the relationship even closer.

Deng Yingchao said that Premier U Nu's visit to our country this time will result in the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty, further solidifying the friendship between the two countries with a treaty. She said that we must resolutely safeguard this treaty. Although the imperialists are particularly keen on provoking relations between China and Asian-African countries, the further development and consolidation of the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Burma cannot but be a heavy blow to the imperialists' conspiracy to provoke.

She said that after the Chinese government and the Burmese government signed the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression this year, they successively signed treaties of peace and friendship or treaties of friendship and non-aggression with the governments of Nepal, Afghanistan, and Guinea. This has not only promoted the unprecedented development and consolidation of friendship between China and these countries but is also conducive to peace in Asia, Africa, and the world. She especially expressed her respect and gratitude to Premier U Nu and General Ne Win of the Burmese government for setting an example and making contributions.

She said that Chinese and Burmese women should further unite, work hand in hand, and work together to continuously consolidate and develop the friendship between the two peoples, for the happiness of women and children, for the development of the unity and cooperation of the people of all countries, for opposing imperialism, for supporting the struggle of the people of oppressed countries against colonialism and for national independence, and for safeguarding peace in Asia, Africa, and the world, and make new and greater achievements and contributions.

Mrs. Nu, who is visiting our country for the third time, said at the tea party today that when she arrived in Beijing yesterday, despite the autumn rain, she felt infinitely warm because of the enthusiastic welcome of countless Chinese women in the rain, which showed their kind friendship towards the Burmese people. She said that she was happy to be able to celebrate the Chinese National Day and participate in the celebration of the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty with Chinese women sisters. She expressed her heartfelt congratulations to all Chinese women on behalf of the Burmese women.

Mrs. Nu said that Burma and China, which have been subjected to long-term and cruel oppression by colonialism and imperialism, are very backward in all aspects. It is an arduous task to go from a backward country to an advanced country, and it can only be achieved by uniting the strength of the people of the whole country.

In her speech, Mrs. Nu also introduced the current lives and work of Burmese women and the role they play in the cause of building their motherland.

Chinese artists and kindergarten children performed songs and dances from both China and Burma for the distinguished guests. Finally, the All-China Women's Federation presented gifts to the distinguished guests.

Mrs. Kyaw Winn, wife of the Burmese Ambassador to China, attended the tea party. Also attending the tea party were: Li Dequan, Yang Zhihua, and Liu Qingyang, Vice-Chairmen of the All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China; Zhang Qian, wife of Vice-Premier of the State Council Chen Yi; Hao Zhiping, wife of Vice-Premier of the State Council and Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Luo Ruiqing; Wang Yi, wife of Li Yimang, Chinese Ambassador to Burma; and more than 70 well-known women from all walks of life in the capital. The tea party proceeded in a cordial and friendly atmosphere. (Attached picture)

　　全国妇女联合会举行茶会
　　欢迎吴努总理夫人和奈温将军夫人
    新华社29日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会今天下午在和平宾馆举行茶会，热烈欢迎吴努总理夫人和奈温将军夫人以及缅甸来我国访问的贸易、文化等代表团中的女朋友们，并通过她们，转达中国妇女对缅甸妇女最深厚的友谊和亲戚般的问候。
    茶会由全国妇联主席蔡畅主持。
    全国妇联副主席邓颖超在会上讲话。她首先向贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎。她说，中缅两国人民，不仅是朋友，还是胞波，朋友兼亲戚，真是亲上加亲，喜上添喜。
    邓颖超说，这次吴努总理来我国，将要签订中缅边界条约，进一步把两国的友谊用条约固定下来。她说，我们一定要坚决维护这个条约。尽管帝国主义特别热中于挑拨中国和亚非国家之间的关系，中缅两国友好合作关系的进一步发展和巩固，不能不是对于帝国主义挑拨阴谋的一个沉重打击。
    她说，今年我国政府和缅甸政府签订了友好和互不侵犯条约以后，又先后分别和尼泊尔、阿富汗和几内亚等国政府签订了和平友好条约或友好和互不侵犯条约。这不仅使我国和这些国家的友谊得到空前的发展和巩固，而且有利于亚非和世界和平。她特向缅甸政府吴努总理、奈温将军作出的范例和贡献表示敬意和感谢。
    她说，中缅两国妇女要更进一步地团结，携手并肩，共同努力，为了不断巩固和发展两国人民的友谊，为了妇女和儿童的幸福，为了发展各国人民的团结合作，为了反对帝国主义，支持被压迫国家人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争，为了保卫亚非和世界的和平，作出新的更大的成就和贡献。
    第三次来我国访问的努夫人今天在茶会上说，昨天到达北京时，尽管下着秋雨，但由于无数中国妇女冒雨热烈欢迎所表现的对缅甸人民的亲切的友谊，使我们感到无限的温暖。她说，这次能够和中国妇女姊妹们共同庆祝中国国庆和参加庆祝签订中缅边界条约的活动感到高兴，她代表缅甸妇女向全中国妇女表示衷心的祝贺。
    努夫人说，曾受殖民主义和帝国主义长期残酷压迫的缅甸和中国，各方面都是非常落后的。要从落后的国家走上先进的国家是个艰巨的任务，必须团结全国人民的力量才能实现。
    努夫人在讲话中还介绍了缅甸妇女今天的生活、工作和她们在建设祖国的事业中所发挥的作用。
    中国艺术家们和幼儿园孩子为贵宾们表演了中缅两国的歌舞。最后，全国妇联向贵宾们赠送了礼物。
    参加茶会的有缅甸驻华大使叫温的夫人。参加茶会的有：中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会副主席李德全、杨之华、刘清扬，国务院副总理陈毅夫人张茜，国务院副总理、中国人民解放军总参谋长罗瑞卿夫人郝治平，中国驻缅甸大使李一氓夫人王仪，以及首都各界妇女著名人士七十多人。茶会在亲切友好的气氛中进行。（附图片）
