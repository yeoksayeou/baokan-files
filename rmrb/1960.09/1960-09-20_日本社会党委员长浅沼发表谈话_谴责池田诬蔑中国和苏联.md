Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 19th: Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma issued a statement at a press conference held in Kudamatsu City on the 18th, condemning Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda for slandering China and the Soviet Union.  Ikeda said at a Liberal Democratic Party speech in Sendai City on the 17th that "Communist countries may be trying to engage in trade with Japan for their own benefit, using trade as bait. Therefore, Japan must join hands with liberal countries through free trade, and through enriching domestic affairs, make communist countries fear us."

Asanuma said that just as China and the Soviet Union are taking further positive steps to improve relations with Japan—the Soviet Union has decided to hold a local product exhibition in Japan, and China has stated the three principles of trade with Japan—it is incomprehensible that Ikeda would say such things to slander China and the Soviet Union.

Asanuma pointed out that Ikeda's remarks clearly expose the Kishinobu-style nature of the Ikeda government.

Asanuma also pointed out that although Ikeda pretends to be "low-profile" on the surface, he is plotting to maliciously revise the Constitution and the Basic Law on Education.

Asanuma stated that recently, the Minister of Foreign Affairs has visited South Korea and the United States, actively engaging in activities.  In order to oppose the Ikeda Cabinet's foreign policy, the Socialist Party will hold a Central Executive Committee meeting on the 21st to determine and publish the Socialist Party's foreign policy.

    日本社会党委员长浅沼发表谈话
    谴责池田诬蔑中国和苏联
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎18日在下松市举行的记者招待会上发表谈话，谴责日本首相池田勇人诬蔑中苏两国。池田17日在仙台市举行的自由民主党的演讲会上说，“共产主义国家可能是以贸易为诱饵企图同日本进行对自己有利的交易。因此，日本要通过自由贸易同自由主义国家携手，并通过充实内政，使共产主义国家敬畏”。
    浅沼说，正当中苏两国对改善同日本的关系采取进一步积极的态度的时候——苏联决定在日本举行土产品展览会，中国表明了对日贸易三项原则，池田竟说出这种话来诬蔑中苏两国，这是令人难以理解的。
    浅沼指出，池田这番发言清楚地暴露了池田政府是岸信介式政权的面貌。
    浅沼还指出，池田虽然表面上装着“低姿势”，但他却在阴谋恶劣修改宪法和教育基本法。
    浅沼表示，最近以来外务相访问了南朝鲜和美国，积极进行活动。为了反对池田内阁的外交政策，社会党21日将召开中央执行委员会会议确定并发表社会党的外交方针。
