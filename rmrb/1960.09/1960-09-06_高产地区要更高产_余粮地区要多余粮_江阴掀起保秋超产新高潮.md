High-Yield Areas to Yield Even More, Grain-Surplus Areas to Surplus Even More
Jiangyin Launches New Upsurge in Ensuring Autumn Harvest and Exceeding Production Targets

(Our dispatch from Nanjing, September 5th) The broad masses of cadres and people in Jiangyin County, Jiangsu, a high-yield grain area, are actively responding to the call of the Central Committee, concentrating all their efforts on deeply developing the movement to ensure the autumn harvest and exceed production targets. Their action slogan is: "Take grain as the key link, fight for grain, contend for every pound, the more the better!"

Jiangyin is a grain-surplus county. Since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, grain output has increased year after year, and about 200 million jin of grain are sold every year. At present, the 680,000 mu of mid-season rice has matured, growing vigorously; the 220,000 mu of late rice is growing strongly. Recently, the Jiangyin County Party Committee organized more than 2,000 cadres from county and commune-level agencies and enterprises to go deep into the production teams for publicity, adopting the method of "one think" (recalling the benefits of abundant grain in the past and the difficulties of scarce grain in lean years), "two look" (looking at the needs of national construction), and "three find" (finding the tricks to increase production and save grain, and studying specific measures) to further mobilize the masses and launch a new upsurge in ensuring the autumn harvest and exceeding production targets.

Should grain-surplus areas contend for every pound of grain? A few people believe: "A bumper harvest is already in sight, there will always be a surplus of grain, why bother with a few pounds!" Most people believe that contending for every pound of grain is a major matter. From our own point of view, although there is already a surplus of grain, we must have more reserves; from the overall point of view, to erase the traces of "poverty and blankness" as soon as possible, we must have more surplus grain to support national construction. Whether from our own point of view or from the point of view of the country, contending for every pound of grain is a "foolproof plan." The broad masses of cadres and people unanimously realize that they should give full play to the superior conditions of high-yield areas and strive to increase grain production for the country.

Under the new battle goal, nearly one million people in the county first grasped the key to competing for ears and grains. According to the experience that "when the autumn is dry, food is cut off" and "one more watering will result in one more layer of skin", more than 6,000 teams in the county have each designated three to four water managers, who are specifically responsible for water management. They insist on checking the fields and water twice every morning and evening to ensure that the fields are not dehydrated and the water is not too deep, and they irrigate frequently with shallow water. In order to compete for ears and grains, many places continue to apply quick-acting fertilizers. According to the experience of the No. 2 Production Team and the Nos. 3 and 4 sub-teams of Yangshe Commune last year, applying phosphate fertilizer after the rice eared increased the yield by more than 30 jin per mu compared with ordinary fields. On August 25th and 26th, the commune organized more than 3,000 people to apply phosphate fertilizer to more than 20,000 mu of mid-season rice. Through inspection, Beiguo Commune applied another 2,000 dan of human manure and nearly 20,000 jin of chemical fertilizer to more than 2,000 mu of late rice and double-cropping rice that had begun to lose fertilizer. For the 220,000 mu of late rice in the county, more than 40,000 people have organized a shock brigade to prevent diseases and control insects, checking the fields every day to search for diseases and insects, and eliminate them as soon as they are discovered.

Second, three guarantee measures have been formulated: (1) Protect the rice along the roadsides, manage chickens and ducks well, and do not lose a single grain. Through screening throughout the county, there are more than 200,000 mu of fields along roadsides, around villages, and where cattle graze frequently. In the past, these roadside rice fields were not well managed, and people and animals trampled on them, wasting a lot of grain. This year, each team has fixed two or three semi-laborers to be responsible for guarding them. (2) Universally implement site innovation, changing the past practice of one team with multiple sites to one team with one site, establishing a site management system, and studying specific measures to reduce and eliminate grain loss. The leveling of sites and main roads has also begun. (3) Vigorously carry out tool preparation centered on mechanized threshing to ensure timely harvesting and timely threshing. More than 10,000 people from the county's industrial and handicraft departments have brought tools to the countryside to go deep into the production teams and repair autumn harvesting farm tools team by team. Third, using all available open spaces and ruins, launch a movement to increase the planting of late autumn crops centered on the large-scale planting of carrots. In the past, Jiangyin County rarely planted late autumn crops. This year, in order to increase grain production as much as possible, more than 90,000 mu have been planted, and management is carried out immediately after planting. At present, more than 30,000 mu of the late autumn crops that have been planted in the county have been topdressed and weeded, and more than 10,000 mu have been thinned. In addition, the county has also allocated more than 100,000 mu of early glutinous rice and early harvested mid-season rice fields to fully utilize the gap of nearly a month before autumn planting to intercrop a season of large Chinese cabbage.

Now, all walks of life have also taken action. An agricultural support army of more than 50,000 people from the county is陆续 (lù xù: one after another) heading to the countryside and joining this battle to ensure the autumn harvest and exceed production targets.

### 高产地区要更高产　余粮地区要多余粮  江阴掀起保秋超产新高潮

    高产地区要更高产　余粮地区要多余粮
    江阴掀起保秋超产新高潮
    本报南京5日电　粮食高产地区的江苏江阴县，广大干部和群众积极响应中央号召，集中全力深入开展保秋超产运动，他们的行动口号是：“以粮为纲，为粮而战，斤粮必争，多多益善！”
    江阴是个余粮县。解放后，特别是大跃进以来，粮食产量年年上升，每年出售粮食两亿斤左右。目前，六十八万亩中稻已经齐穗沉头，生长旺盛；二十二万亩晚稻长势健旺。最近，江阴县委组织县、社级机关企业中二千多名干部，深入到生产小队进行宣传，采取一想（回忆过去丰年粮足的好处，歉年粮少的难处）、二看（看国家建设的需要）、三找（找当前增产节约粮食的窍门，研究具体措施）的办法，进一步发动群众，掀起了保秋超产新高潮。
    余粮地区要不要斤粮必争？有少数人认为：“丰收已经摆在眼前，粮食总归有余，斤把几斤何必再去费劲！”大多数人认为：斤粮必争是件大事。从自己来说，现在粮食虽已有余，但还必须有更多的储备；从全局来说，要早日抹去“一穷二白”的痕迹，必须要有更多的余粮支援国家建设。无论从本身计、从国家计，斤粮必争都是“万全之计”。广大干部和群众一致认识到应该充分发挥高产地区的优越条件，努力为国家多增产粮食。
    全县近百万人民在新的战斗目标下，首先狠抓争穗争粒这一关。全县六千多个小队，根据“秋干断食粮”、“多灌一次水，多长一层皮”的经验，每队确定三至四个管水员，专门负责水浆管理，每天坚持早晚两次查田看水，确保田不脱水，水不过深，浅水勤灌。为了争穗争粒，许多地方继续追施速效肥料。杨舍公社根据去年第二生产队三、四小队七百多亩稻子抽穗以后增施磷肥，每亩比一般田多收三十多斤的经验，在8月25、26两天，组织三千多人，对全社两万多亩中稻增施了一次磷肥。北国公社通过检查，对开始脱肥的二千多亩晚稻和双季间作稻，又追了两千多担人粪和近二万斤化肥。全县二十二万亩晚稻，现有四万多人组织了防病治虫突击队，天天查田头搜病虫，随发现，随扑灭。
    第二，制定了三条保证措施：（一）拦好路边稻，管好鸡鸭，不损失一粒粮。全县通过排队，大路边、村庄周围田和牛吃草常走到的地方，计有二十多万亩田。往年这些路边稻管理不好，人畜践踏，浪费不少。今年每队固定二到三个半劳动力负责看管。（二）普遍实行场地革新，改过去一队多场为一队一场，建立场头管理制度，研究减少和杜绝粮食损失的具体措施。场地和主要道路的平整工作也已着手进行。（三）大搞以脱粒机械化为中心的工具准备，保证适时收割，及时脱粒。全县工业、手工业部门已有一万多人带工具下乡深入生产小队，逐队整修秋收农具。第三，利用一切可以利用的空地和废墟，开展以大种胡萝卜为中心的增种晚秋作物的运动。过去江阴县很少种晚秋作物，今年为了增产粮食多多益善，已种了九万多亩，并做到种后就管。目前全县已种的晚秋作物中已有三万多亩进行了追肥除草，有一万多亩间了苗。另外，全县还划出十万多亩早糯稻和早收割的中稻田，充分利用秋种前近个把月的间隙，套种一季大青菜。
    现在，各行各业也都行动起来了。全县一支五万多人的支援农业大军正陆续开赴农村，投入这场保秋超产大战。
