Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: Across the country, a patriotic health campaign is being launched in close conjunction with current production efforts to further improve the sanitary conditions of urban and rural areas and welcome the eleventh anniversary of National Day with cleanliness.

In the capital, Beijing, since late August, three citywide hygiene campaigns have been carried out to eliminate mosquitoes and flies, improve environmental and food hygiene, and prevent diseases. Cleaning teams in various districts have already emptied all of the more than two thousand toilets located near the city's outer walls, and, together with the widespread emptying of public and household toilets in the urban areas, have collected more than 50,000 tons of human waste. At the same time, urban and suburban areas have collected more than 80,000 tons of organic waste and more than 100 tons of horse manure. This has not only improved environmental sanitation but also provided a large amount of high-quality fertilizer for autumn vegetable and wheat field planting in rural areas. All sectors and residents are actively engaged in indoor and outdoor cleaning, and some public places have already taken on a new look. The people of Shanghai, in conjunction with the movement to support agriculture by accumulating fertilizer, are also vigorously promoting environmental sanitation and eliminating breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies, to welcome National Day with a clean and beautiful city appearance. So far, a total of 11.57 million dan of fertilizer has been accumulated, most of which has been sent to rural areas. Due to the strengthening of the district cleaning system, many areas and streets have become cleaner and more beautiful. In recent days, Tianjin has also launched a hygiene campaign focusing on cleaning up stations, ports, public places, and roads in prosperous areas. All employees of the main passenger station, the East Station, have thoroughly cleaned the inside and outside of the station and established a system of dedicated personnel responsible for all-day cleaning. In the bustling Heping District, some streets have been cleaned spotlessly. Hefei City has recently launched a campaign to accumulate and deliver fertilizer to the countryside in conjunction with a large-scale environmental sanitation drive. Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, and Inner Mongolia, five provinces and regions, have organized a joint autumn hygiene inspection since September 11th to welcome National Day with cleanliness.

The vast rural areas are also closely combining fertilizer accumulation, autumn harvesting and planting, and field management to carry out hygiene campaigns. Jishan County, a national hygiene red flag county, has organized more than 70% of its medical personnel to go deep into rural public canteens and carry out pest and disease eradication work, focusing on the canteens. The work of eliminating the "four pests" in rural and pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved great success. Forty-four banners and counties (cities) have made it difficult to find domestic rats, and eight banners and counties (cities) have met the requirements for eliminating both domestic and wild rats. Due to the practical implementation of the "active prevention and treatment" policy, the adoption of comprehensive measures, and the focus on preventive medication, systematic treatment, vigorous elimination of adult mosquitoes, and treatment of mosquito breeding sites, the opportunity for malaria to occur has been greatly reduced in rural areas of Hunan Province. Since the beginning of this year, malaria has not occurred in thirty-four counties and cities throughout the province.

As National Day approaches, the patriotic hygiene campaign is continuing to unfold in depth throughout the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 24th: The mass patriotic health campaign in Foshan City, Guangdong, a national hygiene red flag city, has taken another step towards higher standards.

Since the National Urban Patriotic Health Campaign On-the-Spot Conference was held in Foshan City in March, the people of Foshan City, under the leadership of the Party, have continued to organize several hygiene campaigns with a spirit of continuous revolution. These campaigns have all aimed at eliminating the "four pests," eliminating mosquito and fly breeding grounds, and improving the quality of hygiene work on a large scale. They have adopted the method of combining technical personnel with the masses, and have built eighty waste fermentation pools for storing garbage and fifteen large-scale manure fermentation pools throughout the city. At the sewer outlets in several urban areas that are prone to breeding mosquito larvae, methods such as covering, rerouting, and extending have been used to divert the sewage discharged from the city to rivers farther away from the urban area. The masses have generally developed the habit of eliminating "pests" whenever they are seen, and after each rain, they automatically turn over pots and cans to prevent mosquito larvae from breeding in stagnant water. Because the conditions for breeding the "four pests" have been fundamentally eliminated, the density of the "four pests" in the city has been greatly reduced, and residents in many streets can sleep peacefully at night without hanging mosquito nets.

Foshan City is also continuously improving residents' living conditions and raising the level of hygiene knowledge of the people. The city widely holds lectures on hygiene knowledge to raise the level of hygiene knowledge of the people. Now, a social atmosphere of paying attention to cleanliness and hygiene has generally formed. The number of "hygienic families" in the city has increased from more than 6,000 in March to more than 10,000 now, and a group of households and streets with even higher hygiene standards has emerged.

Currently, the primary task of hygiene work in Foshan City is to support agriculture. Medical and health departments have adopted methods such as linking up with rural people's communes and production brigades, and organizing medical personnel to go to the countryside to help suburban areas carry out pest and disease eradication campaigns centered on fertilizer accumulation. Urban areas are also combining the improvement of environmental sanitation with the cleaning of ditches and toilet bottoms, and transporting the cleaned-up fertilizer to the countryside to support agricultural production.

　　全国各地结合生产开展卫生突击运动
　　干干净净迎接国庆
　　佛山市爱国卫生运动向更高标准迈进
    据新华社23日讯　全国各地正在紧密结合当前生产开展爱国卫生突击运动，进一步改善城乡卫生面貌，干干净净地迎接十一周年国庆。
    首都北京从8月下旬开始到现在，已经在全市范围内展开了三次卫生突击运动，消灭蚊蝇，搞好环境卫生、饮食卫生和防病工作。各区的清洁队员们已经把城区关厢附近的两千多个厕所全部清掏了一次，加上市区普遍清掏公共厕所和户厕，共收集人粪尿五万多吨；同时城区和近郊还收集有机垃圾八万多吨，马粪一百多吨。既改善了环境卫生，又为农村秋菜和麦田播种提供了大量的优质肥料。各行各业和居民住户正在纷纷进行室内外扫除，有些公共场所已面貌一新。上海市各界人民结合支援农业积肥运动，也正在大搞环境卫生、消灭蚊蝇孳生地，以整洁美观的市容迎接国庆节。到现在为止，共已积肥一千一百五十七万担，绝大部分都已送到农村。由于加强地段保洁制度，不少地区和街道已更加整洁美观。天津市连日来也以整顿车站、港口、公共场所和繁华地区的马路为主，开展卫生突击运动。主要客运车站——东车站的全体职工已对站内外进行了彻底扫除，并定出了专人负责整日保洁制度。繁华的和平区，有些街道已经打扫得干干净净。合肥市最近结合大搞环境卫生，开展积肥送肥下乡的突击运动。河北、山西、山东、河南、内蒙古五省区为了干干净净迎接国庆节，从9月11日起就组织了秋季卫生联合大检查。
    各地广大农村也紧密结合积肥、秋收秋种、田间管理，开展卫生突击运动。全国卫生红旗县——稷山县，组织了全县70％以上的医务人员深入农村公共食堂，以食堂为中心开展除害灭病工作。内蒙古自治区农村牧区除四害工作取得很大成绩，有四十四个旗、县（市）已不容易找到家鼠、有八个旗、县（市）已达到家鼠、野鼠并灭的要求。湖南省农村的防疟工作，由于切实贯彻“积极防治”方针，采取综合措施，抓住预防服药、系统治疗、大力消灭成蚊、处理蚊子孳生场所等各个环节，大大杜绝了疟疾发生的机会。今年以来全省有三十四个县市没有发生过瘧疾。
    随着国庆节的临近，各地爱国卫生突击运动正在继续深入地展开。
    据新华社广州24日电　全国卫生红旗市——广东佛山市的群众性爱国卫生运动，又向着更高标准迈进了一步。
    自从3月份全国城市爱国卫生运动现场会议在佛山市开过以后，佛山市人民在党的领导下，继续以不断革命的精神组织了多次卫生突击运动。这几次突击运动都以消灭“四害”，消除蚊蝇孳生地，大面积地提高卫生工作质量作为目标。他们采取技术人员与群众相结合的办法，在全市建筑了八十个贮放垃圾的废物发酵池，十五个大型粪便发酵池。市区几条容易孳生孑孓的下水道出水口，采用加盖、改道、延长等办法，以便把市内排出来的污水引向离市区较远的河道。群众已普遍养成见“害”必除的习惯，每逢雨后，便自动翻盆倒罐，使孑孓无从在积水中孳生。由于从根本上杜绝了“四害”孳生的条件，全市“四害”密度大大下降，不少街道的居民晚上不用挂帐子也能安稳睡觉了。
    佛山市还不断改善居民居住条件和提高人民群众的卫生知识水平。全市广泛举办卫生知识讲座，提高人民群众的卫生知识水平。现在，讲究清洁、注意卫生的社会风气普遍形成，全市的“卫生之家”已由3月间的六千多户增加到现在的一万多户，还涌现了一批卫生标准更高的住户和街道。
    当前佛山市的卫生工作正以支援农业作为首要任务。医疗卫生部门采取与郊区人民公社、生产大队挂钩，组织医务人员下乡等办法，帮助郊区开展以积肥为中心的除害灭病运动。市区也结合改善环境卫生和清理沟渠、厕所底，将清理出来的肥料运送下乡，支援农业生产。（附图片）
