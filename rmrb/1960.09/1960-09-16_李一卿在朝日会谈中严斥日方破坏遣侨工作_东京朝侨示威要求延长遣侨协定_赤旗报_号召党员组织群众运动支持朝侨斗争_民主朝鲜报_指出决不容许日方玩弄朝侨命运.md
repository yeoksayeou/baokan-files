Xinhua News Agency, September 14th dispatch from Tokyo: Li Yiqing, head of the North Korean Red Cross delegation, emphasized at the seventh official negotiation regarding the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan today that if the Japanese side refuses to unconditionally extend the repatriation agreement to sabotage the repatriation work, Japan will not be able to evade the responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

However, the head of the Japanese Red Cross delegation, Yoshizi Kasai, once again stated that he "cannot accept" North Korea's proposal to extend the repatriation agreement without modification. But he then said that he was willing to study Li Yiqing's proposal in depth.

The two sides agreed to hold the eighth formal meeting on the morning of the 17th.

In Niigata City, the location of the negotiations, representatives of the Japan-DPRK Association's Niigata branch and other mass organizations, as well as dozens of Korean residents, met with Kasai, demanding an unconditional extension of the agreement.

Today in Tokyo, approximately six hundred Korean residents demonstrated in front of the Japanese Red Cross headquarters and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, demanding that the repatriation agreement be extended without modification.

Xinhua News Agency, September 13th dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese Communist Party's organ "Akahata" published an editorial today pointing out that the deadlock in the negotiations between the Red Cross societies of Japan and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan should be the responsibility of the Japanese government and the Japanese Red Cross.

"Akahata" pointed out: "From the beginning, the Japanese government has placed political considerations first." "The Japanese side's attempt to create difficulties in the current negotiations is clearly aimed at pleasing South Korea." "Akahata" went on to point out that the Japanese government's attempt to undermine the repatriation negotiations, undermine friendship between Japan and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and cultivate "friendship" with South Korea is to pave the way for the US imperialists to establish a Northeast Asia Treaty Organization in the Far East.

"Akahata" finally called on all Japanese Communist Party members to do their utmost to oppose the government's bad attitude and organize a large-scale mass movement to support the struggle of Korean residents.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 14th: "Democratic Korea" published a commentary today saying that the Korean people resolutely oppose and condemn the Japanese side's conspiracy to undermine the agreement on the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan.

The commentary pointed out that the Japanese side's proposed amendments to obstruct the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan are for nothing other than the fact that the Japanese authorities, under the direction of US imperialism, are colluding with the South Korean puppet authorities. The commentary emphasized that the Japanese authorities cannot escape the political and moral obligation to enable every Korean resident in Japan who wishes to return to the Republic to do so according to their wishes. At the same time, this is also the Japanese side's obligation to the current agreement based on humanitarian principles. The Korean people will never allow the Japanese side, under the manipulation of US imperialism, to play with the fate of Korean residents in Japan and use it as capital for political transactions with South Korea.

    李一卿在朝日会谈中严斥日方破坏遣侨工作
    东京朝侨示威要求延长遣侨协定
    “赤旗报”号召党员组织群众运动支持朝侨斗争
    “民主朝鲜报”指出决不容许日方玩弄朝侨命运
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：朝鲜红十字会代表团团长李一卿今天在关于遣送朝侨的第七次正式谈判中强调说，如果日本方面拒绝无条件延长遣侨协定来破坏遣侨工作，那么日本将不能逃避对由此产生的一切后果应负的责任。
    但是日本红十字会代表团团长葛西嘉资再次表示，“不能接受”朝鲜提出的不经修改地延长遣侨协定的建议。但是他随即又说，他愿意深入研究李一卿的建议。
    双方同意在17日上午举行第八次正式会议。
    在谈判地点——新澙市，日朝协会新澙分会和其它群众团体的代表以及几十名朝鲜侨民会见了葛西，要求无条件延长协定。
    今天在东京，大约有六百名朝鲜侨民在日本红十字会总部和日本外务省前面举行示威，要求不加修改地延长遣侨协定。
    据新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论指出：日本和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的红十字会关于遣送旅日朝侨的谈判陷于停顿，应由日本政府和日本红十字会负责。
      “赤旗报”指出：“从一开始，日本政府就把政治考虑放在第一位”。“日本方面企图在目前的谈判中制造困难，其目的显然是为了取悦南朝鲜。”“赤旗报”接着指出，日本政府企图通过破坏遣送朝侨谈判、破坏日本同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的友谊以及培植同南朝鲜的“友谊”，来为美帝国主义者在远东建立东北亚条约组织铺平道路。
    “赤旗报”最后号召日本所有的共产党员竭尽全力来反对政府的恶劣态度，并组织声势浩大的群众运动，来支持朝鲜侨民的斗争。
    据新华社平壤14日电　“民主朝鲜报”今天发表评论说，朝鲜人民坚决反对和谴责日本方面企图破坏旅日朝侨归国协定的阴谋。
    评论指出，日本方面提出阻挠旅日朝侨归国工作的修正案不是为了别的，只不过是因为日本当局在美帝国主义的指使下同南朝鲜傀儡当局进行勾结。评论强调指出，日本当局决不能逃避使每个希望回到共和国来的旅日朝侨能按照他们的希望回国的政治上和道德上的义务。同时，这也是日本方面对于根据人道主义原则的现行协定所负的义务。朝鲜人民决不容许日本方面在美帝国主义操纵下玩弄旅日朝侨的命运，并把它当作同南朝鲜进行政治交易的资本的行为。
