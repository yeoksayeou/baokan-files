Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 28th: The six rapid tunneling teams at the Hebi Coal Mine, led by Qi Hezhi's tunneling team, are engaged in a competition to greet National Day with high quality and high production, striving to outdo each other and creating outstanding achievements. As of September 20th, each team had achieved a tunneling advance of over 1,100 meters, exceeding the planned target by more than two times. Adding to the quantities completed in the past eight months, and calculated according to quotas, each tunneling team has long since entered the period of 1961 to 1964.

　　Qi Hezhi's tunneling team has cumulatively completed 17,049.44 meters of advance, equivalent to more than three years of work.

　　The six rapid tunneling teams, in addition to the national coal mine tunneling pacesetter Qi Hezhi's team, include the teams of Zhang Gen, Guan Dexi, Li Jianbang, Liu Changxiu, and Zhang Xianyin. Since September, workers of all trades at the Hebi Coal Mine have launched a competition to dedicate more coal and better coal to National Day with practical actions. The six rapid tunneling teams are even more enthusiastic, competing to win red flags. Qi Hezhi's team, which has maintained a record of monthly tunneling exceeding 2,000 meters for four consecutive months, is full of fighting spirit and first issued a competition proposal to the five brother tunneling teams, determined to strive for an annual advance of 24,000 meters, ensuring an advance of 12,000 meters in the last four months, and formulating five effective measures. Each team also put forward a response plan based on its own actual situation, and the competition was launched enthusiastically.

　　When Qi Hezhi's team encountered the difficulty of a seven- or eight-inch thick "waist gangue" in level tunneling, they worked practically and cleverly, creating the "artillery pressure waist gangue method," subduing the hard "waist gangue" and increasing the daily advance from 60 meters to more than 70 meters. As the obstacles on the road ahead were broken through one by one, Qi Hezhi's team's monthly single-hole advance had reached 1,127.04 meters by September 20th, and it is advancing at a high speed of more than 70 meters every day.

　　The five rapid tunneling teams that have emerged in the "learn from, catch up with, and surpass" Qi Hezhi's team movement are also not showing weakness, breaking through their own past advance records one after another. Zhang Gen's tunneling team from the Third Construction Engineering Office first became a strong opponent of Qi Hezhi's team. Zhang Gen's team has always taken Qi Hezhi's team as a learning model. After creating a record of 3,000 meters of monthly advance in August, they paid more attention to educating team members to prevent arrogance and complacency and to prevent fear of difficulty and slackening. They combined humbly learning the advanced experience of brother teams with summarizing the successful experience of their own team, creating many advanced machines and advanced experiences such as the "fan-shaped eye drilling method" and the "double-bucket coal excavator," which increased tunneling efficiency by more than five times. In the first and middle ten days of September, the advance of this tunneling team reached 1,182.7 meters, which was 55 meters higher than that of Qi Hezhi's team. Other teams also humbly learned from others' experience and took effective measures to ensure the growth of tunneling advance.

　　The six rapid tunneling teams, led by Qi Hezhi's team, are not satisfied with their existing achievements. They regard the National Day holiday as a new starting point for their leap forward, determined to advance towards the higher goal of 3,000 meters of monthly advance.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 28th: Recently, a machine with huge palms has appeared on the 818 extraction working face of the Tongjialiang Coal Mine. It roars continuously, pushing the coal onto the chute and sending it into the coal car. It only requires one person to operate, and replaces manual coal loading with an efficiency of 50 tons of coal per hour. This is the "Datong Type II" coal loading machine recently created successfully by Mao A'mao, an engineer from a worker background, to dedicate to National Day.

　　Mao A'mao was originally a fitter at the Tongjialiang Machine Repair Branch of the Datong Coal Mine. In January of this year, he successfully created the "Datong Type I" coal loading machine, eliminating the last manual operation in the extraction working face. However, this coal loading machine is only suitable for longwall mining methods, and not suitable for the newly promoted bin-style mining method. Once, Mao A'mao went down the well and saw that the bin-style mining method only laid a chute in the middle of the more than eight-meter-wide working face, and the coal was loaded from both sides far away. He asked the workers: "How many tons can you load in a shift?" The workers said: "It's not accurate. It would be great if another coal loading machine could be invented." Mao A'mao was originally thinking about manufacturing a coal loading machine suitable for the new mining method, and he was even more determined after hearing the workers' words. After reporting to the Party Committee, he received the encouragement and support of the Party Committee.

　　The design began. Based on the coal loading part of the "Datong Type I" coal loading machine, and referring to the structure of the transmission part of other coal loading machines, Mao A'mao completed all the design tasks within ten days. The newly designed "Datong Type II" coal loading machine has a simple structure, fewer parts, is easy to operate, and is highly efficient. The mine Party Committee approved his design, and the manufacturing work was about to begin. However, some people said, "This kind of machine is manufactured by modern large factories. Even if we want to do it, we don't have the processing equipment." Mao A'mao was not intimidated by the difficulties. With the help of the Party Branch of the machine repair factory, he finally overcame the difficulties with the workers and made the "Datong Type II" coal loading machine born in less than a month.

　　Not long after the "Datong Type II" coal loading machine was successfully trial-produced, Mao A'mao began to study the revolution of coal cars. Coal cars are easily damaged, which is an old problem. Since the beginning of the increase production and practice economy movement, the mine Party Committee has listed solving this problem as one of the keys to ensuring the increase of coal production. Mao A'mao thought: "Coal car damage affects coal production, which is a major event related to the increase of production in steel enterprises! I am an engineer trained by the Party, and I must make a revolution in this area to ensure more coal production." After studying with the old workers, he found that the reason for the damage to the coal car was mostly due to the wear of the contact part between the wheel and the axle. Based on this situation, Mao A'mao made a design to modify the wheel axle. Reducing the friction during walking makes the coal car much stronger. The mine Party Committee attached great importance to Mao A'mao's innovation and put forward the slogan of "Fighting hard for ten days to complete the revolution of 150 coal cars to ensure coal loading needs." Now, the reformed coal cars have been continuously sent to the well for use. After this key was broken through, the daily raw coal production level of Tongjialiang Mine in mid-September increased sharply by more than 20% compared with the first ten days of the month.

　　齐合只等刷新掘进纪录
　　毛阿毛创造快速装煤机
    新华社郑州28日电　鹤壁煤矿以齐合只掘进队为首的六个快速掘进队，在优质、高产迎接国庆的竞赛中，你追我赶，创造了优异的成绩。9月份到20日为止，各队掘进进尺都达到一千一百多米，超过规定指标两倍多。加上过去八个月完成的数量，按定额计算，各掘进队早就分别跨入1961年至1964年。
    齐合只掘进队累计完成进尺一万七千零四十九点四四米，等于做了三年多的工作。
    这六个快速掘进队，除全国煤矿掘进标兵齐合只队以外，还有张根、关德喜、李建邦、刘长修、张现印五个队。9月份以来，鹤壁煤矿各工种职工为了以多出煤、出好煤的实际行动向国庆节献礼，展开了竞赛。这六个快速掘进队更是干劲冲天，互夺红旗。连续四个月保持月掘进两千米以上纪录的齐合只队，斗志昂扬，首先向五个兄弟掘进队发出了竞赛倡议书，决心力争全年进尺二万四千米，后四个月保证进尺一万二千米，并订出五项有力措施。各队也根据本队实际情况，提出了应战计划，竞赛随即热烈展开。
    齐合只队在平巷掘进中突然出现七、八寸厚“腰?”的困难情况下，实干加巧干，创造了炮压腰?法，制服了坚硬的“腰?”，日进尺由六十米猛增到七十多米。由于前进道路上的障碍一个个被突破，齐合只队到9月20日止，月度单孔进尺已达一千一百二十七点零四米，并且每日正以七十多米的高速度向前迈进。
    在“学赶超”齐合只队运动中后起的五个快速掘进队，也并不示弱，纷纷突破了本队过去的进尺纪录。第三建井工程处张根掘进队首先成为齐合只队的吃力对手。张根队始终以齐合只队为学习榜样，在8月份创造月进三千米纪录以后，更注意教育队员防止骄傲自满，防止畏难松劲。他们把虚心学习兄弟队的先进经验同总结本队成功经验结合起来，创造了“扇子面打眼法”、“双斗扒煤机”等许多先进机具和先进经验，使掘进工效提高了五倍多。9月上中两旬，这个掘进队的进尺高达一千一百八十二点七米，比齐合只队还高五十五米。其它各队也都虚心学习别人经验，采取有效措施，保证了掘进进尺的增长。
    以齐合只队为首的六个快速掘进队，并不满足于已有的成就。他们把国庆佳节作为自己新的跃进的起点，决心向月进三千米的更高目标前进。
    据新华社太原28日电　在同家梁煤矿的八一八回采工作面上，最近出现了一台长着巨掌的机器。它不停地吼叫着，把煤推到溜子上，送进了煤车，只需要一个人操作，便以每小时装煤五十吨的效率代替了人工装煤。这就是工人出身的工程师毛阿毛，为了向国庆献礼在最近创造成功的“大同二型”装煤机。
    毛阿毛原是大同煤矿同家梁机修分厂的钳工。他在今年1月创造成功了“大同一型”装煤机，消灭了回采工作面中最后一道手工操作的工序。但是，这种装煤机只适用于长壁式的采煤方法，而不适用于新推广的仓房式采煤法。有一次，毛阿毛到井下看到仓房式的采煤方法，在八米多宽的工作面中间，只铺一部溜子，从两边装煤很远。他问工人：“一班能装几吨？”工人们说：“没准头。要是再发明个装煤机就好了。”毛阿毛本来在琢磨着制造一台适合新的采煤方法的装煤机，听了工人们的话更下了决心。他向党委汇报后，得到了党委的鼓励和支持。
    设计开始了。毛阿毛根据“大同一型”装煤机的装煤部分，又参考了其他装煤机传动部分的结构，十天内就完成了全部设计任务。新设计的“大同二型”装煤机，构造简单，零件少，操作容易，效率高。矿党委批准了他的设计，制造工作即将开始。可是，有的人说，“这种机器是现代化大厂子制造的，咱就是想干，没有加工的设备也不行。”毛阿毛并没有被困难吓倒，在机修厂党支部的帮助下，终于与工人们一道战胜了困难，在不到一个月的时间内，就使“大同二型”装煤机诞生了。
      “大同二型”装煤机试制成功不久，毛阿毛又开始研究煤车的革命了。煤车容易损坏，是个老问题，从增产节约运动开始以来，矿党委就把解决这个问题列为保证煤炭增产的关键之一。毛阿毛想：
  “煤车损坏，影响产煤，这是关系到钢铁企业增产的大事啊！自己是党培养起来的工程师，一定要在这上面革命，保证多产煤。”经过和老工人研究，他发现煤车损坏的原因，大多数是由于车轮和车轴接触部分磨坏了。根据这一情况，毛阿毛作出了修改车轮轴部的设计。减少了走车时的摩擦力，使煤车大大牢固了。矿党委很重视毛阿毛的这项革新，提出“苦战十天，完成一百五十部煤车的革命，保证装煤需要”的口号。现在，经过改革的煤车已源源送到井下使用。这个关键被突破后，同家梁矿9月中旬的原煤日产水平就比上旬猛增了20％以上。
