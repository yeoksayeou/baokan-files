Xinhua News Agency Report: According to the Indian Press Trust, Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry, Shastri, stated at a meeting of the Export Promotion Advisory Council in New Delhi on August 28th that the Indian government is about to lift all restrictions on approximately seventy export commodities in order to increase exports and obtain foreign exchange.

According to this news agency, India's foreign exchange reserves have fallen to 1.447 billion rupees, whereas at the start of the Second Five-Year Plan in 1956, India's foreign exchange reserves stood at 7.46 billion rupees. According to an earlier report by Deutsche Presse-Agentur, India's current foreign exchange reserves are lower than the stipulated minimum of 1.6 billion rupees, while in 1947, when India gained independence, foreign exchange reserves were approximately 8 billion rupees.

One of the reasons for the rapid decline in India's foreign exchange reserves is the huge deficit in its foreign trade. According to Shastri's announcement on the 28th, in the first five months of this year, India's foreign trade deficit reached 602.8 million rupees. Shastri stated at the Export Promotion Advisory Council that the export commodities with restrictions lifted will include agricultural products, certain chemicals, certain mechanical products, metal products, and vessels for inland river and port navigation, etc.

Shastri called on various industries to step up exports, and he particularly requested that tea and textiles reduce prices in order to maintain current export levels. Shastri said that due to poor harvests, tea exports in the first half of 1960 decreased by 630 million rupees compared to the same period last year.

In order to solve its foreign exchange difficulties, the Indian government is actively seeking foreign "aid." According to the Indian Press Trust, the Indian Commissioner-General for Economic Affairs in Washington, B.K. Nehru, will soon hold talks with the World Bank on the issue of "aid." It is reported that he will also go to Paris to attend a meeting scheduled for September, with the participation of countries such as the United States, Britain, West Germany, Japan, and France, to consider further "aid" to India.

It is reported that in order to increase export commodities, the Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry also requested the Indian people to reduce consumption at the Export Promotion Advisory Council meeting. He believes that a willingness to endure some sacrifices can create a "psychological state" for increasing exports.

    印度对外贸易逆差巨大
    外汇储备额下降到四年前的五分之一
    政府力求增加出口和取得西方“援助”
    新华社讯 据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度工商部长夏斯特里8月28日在新德里举行的促进出口谘询委员会会议上说，印度政府即将取消对大约七十种出口商品的一切限制，以便增加出口，获得外汇。
    据这家通讯社报道，印度的外汇储备已经降低到十四亿四千七百万卢比，而在第二个五年计划开始的1956年，印度的外汇储备为七十四亿六千万卢比。据德意志新闻社早些时候报道，印度目前的外汇储备已低于规定的最低数十六亿卢比，而在1947年印度获得独立时，外汇储备大约有八十亿卢比。
    印度外汇储备迅速下降的原因之一，是印度的对外贸易出现巨大的逆差。据夏斯特里28日宣布，今年头五个月中，印度的对外贸易逆差达六亿零二百八十万卢比。夏斯特里在促进出口谘询委员会上说，取消限制的出口商品将包括农产品、某些化学品、某些机械制品、金属制品以及内河和港口航行的船只等。
    夏斯特里呼吁各个行业加紧出口，他特别要求茶叶和纺织品降低价格，以保持目前的出口水平。夏斯特里说，由于歉收，1960年上半年的茶叶出口额同去年同一时期比较，减少了六亿三千万卢比。
    印度政府为了解决外汇的困难，正在积极寻找外“援”。据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度驻华盛顿经济事务总专员布·克·尼赫鲁最近将同世界银行就“援助”问题举行会谈。据报道，他还将去巴黎出席定于9月举行的将有美国、英国、西德、日本和法国等国家参加的考虑进一步“援助”印度的会议。
    据报道，为了增加出口商品，印度工商部长在促进出口谘询委员会会议上还要求印度人民减少消费。他认为，愿意遭受若干牺牲，就可为多出口创造一种“心理状态”。
