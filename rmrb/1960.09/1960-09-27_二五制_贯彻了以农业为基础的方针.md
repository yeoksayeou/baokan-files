    The "Two-Five System" Implements the Policy of Taking Agriculture as the Foundation
    Peng Guangfeng, First Secretary of the Wuqiao County Party Committee
    Wuqiao County is a plain area rich in cotton and grain. Over the years, we have always placed agricultural production at the top of all our work, emphasizing that all walks of life should serve the development of agricultural production. As a result, agricultural production has developed relatively rapidly. In particular, since 1958, the growth of agricultural production has been even more rapid. In 1959, the unit area yield of grain increased by 61.1% compared with 1957, turning the county from a grain-deficient area into a surplus grain area. The unit area yield of cotton increased by 29.2% compared with 1957. The great development of agricultural production has driven the great development of industrial production, and the great development of industry and other undertakings has promoted the continuous leap forward in agricultural production. In 1957, there were only twelve small factories with more than ten people in the county, plus forty-nine production cooperatives and groups, with only 1,438 formal workers in the county. Now, it has developed into 137 county- and commune-run factories, with more than 10,000 formal workers. In the past, they could only make iron tools, cast pots, and produce some small agricultural tools. Now, they can produce 192 kinds of products, including high-grade industrial products such as irrigation and drainage machinery, generators, electric motors, chemical fertilizers, and cement, which strongly support agricultural production. The great development of industrial and agricultural production and the increasing improvement of people's lives have promoted the great development of commercial work. The commercial retail sales in 1959 increased by 73.4% compared with 1957. All these facts show that only on the basis of great agricultural development can industry, commerce, and other economic undertakings develop at a high speed and proportionally, and can people's lives be gradually improved.
    Although we have achieved the above-mentioned achievements in implementing the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, the development of agricultural production still cannot keep up with the needs of industrial development and the growing needs of the people's lives because our county's foundation was too weak in the past. Generally speaking, agricultural production in our county has not yet passed the test, and our county is a cotton and grain producing area, and has the responsibility to support the urban people and the country's industrial construction. Therefore, under the leadership of the higher-level Party committee, we should strive to improve ourselves, rely on our own efforts, and better implement the Party's policy of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation.
    How can we better implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation? The practice of several months has proved that the implementation of the "Two-Five System" ensures the better implementation of the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation from the organizational work, the leadership methods and work style of cadres. The "Two-Five System" concentrates the strength of cadres, enabling cadres at all levels to go deep into the front line of agricultural production, specifically lead and organize the masses to realize the agricultural production plan. After cadres from all walks of life go deep into the front line of production, they can better understand the needs of agricultural production and farmers, and thus more effectively support agricultural production.
    When the "Two-Five System" was first implemented, a few comrades expressed doubts. Their main concern was that if there were more people doing central work, the department's business would be affected; if more people went deep into the front line of production, it would be difficult to grasp the overall work situation. This raised the question of the relationship between departmental work and central work, and what attitude should be taken towards central work? A large-scale airing of views, debates, and discussions began around this issue. All departments unified their thinking through discussions in connection with reality. Everyone realized that any superstructure serves the economic base. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and serving agricultural production should be the general policy of all departments' work. Specifically in Wuqiao County, agricultural production is currently facing a serious threat of drought. Although all departments have their own work, they should all be directed towards a common goal, that is, to strive to achieve the cotton and grain production plan for 1960. Departmental work and central work are not on an equal footing, but are related to the part and the whole. Doing a good job in central work will not only not affect departmental work, but on the contrary, only when central work leaps forward can departmental work leap forward. The "Two-Five System" is a good method to ensure that central work and departmental work leap forward together.
    On the basis of unified ideological understanding, all departments have reallocated the strength of cadres and arranged their own work in accordance with the principle of serving the central work while taking into account their own work, and have generally implemented the various provisions of the "Two-Five System." Although this has only been done for a few short months, it has already achieved the following significant effects.
    First, it has effectively strengthened the leadership force in agricultural production. According to statistics, since the implementation of the "Two-Five System," 2,545 cadres at all levels and in all departments have been transferred to work regularly in the front line of production, accounting for 87% of the total number of cadres, an increase of more than 40% compared with before the implementation of the "Two-Five System." A considerable part of these cadres are fixed to teams and do not move for a year. The rest also use central work to do departmental work. The county's 816 production teams have an average of two to three cadres detached from production. The 2,960 production brigades, plus the cadres of the production teams, have reached the point where each brigade has cadres in charge. This group of cadres has formed a strong command force for agricultural production. They are stationed in the front line of production, grasping production with one hand and life with the other, grasping politics with both hands, eating, living, working, discussing, and maintaining close contact with the masses, which has caused a series of profound changes in rural work.
    The most prominent is that after cadres at all levels go deep into the front line of production, the discovery and solution of problems have become more timely and specific. In the past, a problem often had to go through several twists and turns from occurrence, discovery to solution, which not only delayed the time, but also because the leaders' understanding of the situation was mostly indirect, the solution to the problem was inevitably not specific enough. Now, the leading cadres have come to the front line, and once a problem occurs, it will not only be discovered and solved quickly, but also because they have a deep understanding of the situation, the solution is also very specific. For example, Comrade Zhang Shoukai, Secretary of the Secretariat of the County Party Committee, went to work in the Zhang'ao Commune during the busy period of summer planting, and found that the progress of summer planting was slow, mainly because the labor force was not concentrated, and the sideline and logistics occupied too much labor force, and the basic construction that should have been stopped was not stopped; some teams also lacked seeds. Comrade Zhang Shoukai helped solve these problems one by one. The seed problem was solved by clearing warehouses and mutual adjustment, and more than 70,000 catties were raised, which basically met the needs. The summer planting labor problem was solved by carefully calculating accounts and tapping potential, increasing from the original 5,000 people to 12,000 people, which greatly accelerated the progress of summer planting. The 90,000 mu of summer planting tasks in the whole commune were originally planned to be completed in seven days, but were completed in four days. The problems discovered by Comrade Zhang Shoukai in this commune and the experience in solving these problems were transmitted to the communes through a telephone conference convened by the County Party Committee, which played a great role in promoting the summer planting work in the whole county. The labor force engaged in agriculture in the whole county increased from 64% of the total labor force to 75%, and the summer planting labor force increased from 65,000 people to more than 120,000 people. At the same time, more than 500,000 catties of seeds were raised through clearing warehouses and exchanges, which solved the problem of insufficient seeds, and the progress of summer planting in the whole county was more than doubled.
    Second, after cadres at all levels, especially leading cadres, went deep into the front line, they all acted as advisors to the team cadres, gave them ideas and methods, helped them improve their leadership style and work methods, and effectively improved the level of grassroots cadres. There were 135 three-category branches in the county. Since the County Party Committee sent 434 capable Party member cadres to implement long-term team assignments, the work of these branches is changing rapidly. Sixty-three branches have already leaped forward, and thirty-four branches have become red flag branches in the anti-drought movement. After the cadres went down, they also played a great role in promoting the work of the more advanced branches. For example, He Wenli, Deputy Director of the County Party Committee Office, and Fan Youzhen, Director of the Research Section, went to work in the Second Brigade of Shuangliudian Brigade of Chengguan Commune. Through joint research with the team cadres, they implemented the "Seven, One, Two, Four System" (that is, seven days a week, all team cadres participate in labor during the day, one evening for rest, two evenings for research work, and four evenings for learning with the masses) and the "Learn, Do, Research, Bump" working methods, which solved the problem of how the brigade cadres work after the implementation of the "Two-Five System," and made the production of this brigade a greater leap forward. After this working method was promoted by the County Party Committee throughout the county, the leadership level of all production brigades in the county was generally improved. Their work is more planned, and they can not only use the main time to participate in production and lead production, but also have time to learn the Party's policies and scientific and technological knowledge.
    Third, cadres in various departments, especially industrial, financial and trade, cultural and educational departments, have timely and better understood the needs of the masses in production and life because they have gone deep into the front line of production, thus further clarifying the three major viewpoints of serving production, serving politics, and serving the masses, and better serving and supporting agricultural production. For example, bank loans used to go through four procedures: application, investigation, approval, and disbursement. Now, bank cadres take their business to the production team, and they know whether the team lacks funds or not. Therefore, any loan needs can be resolved quickly. For example, Mi Xinwei, President of the Bank, went to work in the Second Production Team of the Third Management District of Jingzhou Commune and found that two machines were idle because there was no money to buy coal. He immediately helped to borrow a sum of cash to start the two machines and put them into the intense anti-drought struggle. Another example is Liu Yaoting, Deputy Director of the Commercial Bureau, who went to work in the Central Store of Liuji Commune in early May and went to Qilizhuang with the salespersons to sell goods. At that time, he was preparing for summer harvest and summer planting, and he found that the team's preparations for summer harvest and summer planting tools were not good enough, and the goods in the central store were also incomplete. He immediately reported this situation to the county bureau, and the county bureau immediately notified the central stores to understand the preparation of summer harvest and summer planting tools in each production team. As a result, it was found that more than 300 teams lacked tools. Therefore, the county bureau cleared the warehouse and organized internal adjustments, and organized procurement. After ten days of blitz, more than 30 kinds of tools and more than 420,000 pieces were added, which timely solved the material supply problem in the summer harvest and summer planting. The industrial sector also more timely and directly supported agricultural production. In the anti-drought, they carried out four major repair and assembly work blitzes, organizing technicians to enter the teams and enter the square fields to repair machines and agricultural tools for the commune members. According to the statistics of four months, more than 140,000 machines and agricultural tools of various types were repaired and assembled, and more than 15,000 water lifting tools and various small agricultural tools were reformed. They also summarized a set of three-haves (machine room, machine base, parts) and four-fixes (fixed location, personnel, tasks, and maintenance) management system for the storage and improvement of machine utilization rate during the repair and assembly in the countryside. After it was promoted throughout the county, the utilization rate of agricultural machinery in the county increased from 40% to more than 80%.
    Fourth, all walks of life have further clarified the important significance of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation, so they have played a greater role in supporting agriculture with initiative, consciousness, and enthusiasm. Now, supporting agriculture in all walks of life has formed a new trend in the county. The clerks of the bank used to go to the organs and factories to undertake savings business, which was considered an advanced experience. Now, they not only take the work of undertaking business to the production teams and commune members' families, but also help the communes and teams to think about the way of production while lending money, help the production teams to raise pigs, and transform saline-alkali land. The clerks who go to the countryside also carry three tools each. After arriving at the production team, they handle business if there is business, and participate in production guidance if there is no business, and repair machines and agricultural tools for the team. In more than four months, more than 100 cadres who often went to the countryside repaired machines and agricultural tools for the production team members more than 10,000 times and gave more than 90,000 vaccinations to pigs. When the film team went to the countryside, they also participated in production during the day and showed movies at night, and also helped the team repair machines. According to the statistics of three months, the county and commune film teams have repaired 87 machines for the production teams. The cultural and educational departments actively help to train technical talents, and have established 670 farmer amateur technical schools in the county, with 17,459 students enrolled. They have initially understood the operating technology of steam engines, gas engines, and gasoline engines. In short, now the whole county has formed a upsurge of supporting agriculture in all walks of life, and launched a competition movement to be a pioneer in supporting agriculture, thus making this year's agricultural harvest a reliable guarantee.

    “二五制”贯彻了以农业为基础的方针
　　中共吴桥县委第一书记　彭广峰
    吴桥县是一个盛产棉花和粮食的平原地区，历年来我们始终把农业生产摆在各项工作的首要地位，强调各行各业都要为发展农业生产服务，因而促使农业生产有了比较迅速的发展。特别是1958年以来，农业生产的增长更为迅速，1959年粮食的单位面积产量比1957年增加了61.1％，使全县由缺粮变为余粮；棉花的单位面积产量比1957年增加了29.2％。农业生产的大发展带动了工业生产的大发展，而工业以及其他事业的大发展又促进了农业生产的持续跃进。1957年全县十人以上的小工厂只有十二个，加上四十九个生产合作社、组，全县仅有正式工人一千四百三十八名；而现在已经发展到一百三十七个县、社经营的工厂，共有一万多正式工人，过去只会打铁、铸锅和生产一部分小农具；现在能够生产包括排灌机械、发电机、电动机、化学肥料和水泥等高级工业产品在内的一百九十二种产品，有力地支援了农业生产。工农业生产的大发展和人民生活的日益提高，促进了商业工作的大发展，1959年的商业零售额比1957年增加了73.4％。所有这些事实都说明，只有在农业大发展的基础上，工业、商业以及其他经济事业才能高速度而又按比例地发展，才能逐步提高人民的生活。
    在贯彻以农业为基础的方针上，我们虽然取得了上述的成绩，但是由于我们县过去的底子太薄，农业生产的发展仍然赶不上工业发展的需要，赶不上人民生活日益增长的需要。一般地说，我们县的农业生产还没有过关，而我们县是一个棉粮产区，有责任支援城市人民，支援国家的工业建设。因此，我们应当在上级党委的领导下，发愤图强，自力更生，更好地贯彻执行党的发展国民经济以农业为基础的方针。
    怎样才能更好地贯彻以农业为基础的方针呢？几个月的实践证明，实行“二五制”，就从组织工作上、从干部的领导方法和工作作风上，保证了以农业为基础的方针的更好地贯彻执行。“二五制”集中使用了干部的力量，使各级干部深入农业生产第一线，具体领导和组织群众实现农业生产计划；而各行各业干部深入生产第一线以后，由于更好地了解了农业生产和农民的需要，也就更有力地支援了农业生产。
    刚开始推行“二五制”的时候，有少数同志表示怀疑。他们主要是担心作中心工作的人多了，部门业务会受影响；深入生产第一线的人多了，全面工作情况不好掌握。这就提出了部门工作和中心工作的关系问题，应该用什么态度对待中心工作？一场大鸣、大放、大辩论，就围绕着这个问题开始了。各部门通过联系实际进行讨论，最后终于统一了思想，大家认识到任何上层建筑都是为经济基础服务的。农业是国民经济的基础，为农业生产服务应该是各部门工作的总方针。具体到吴桥县来说，当前农业生产面临着严重干旱的威胁，各部门虽然都有自己的工作，但都应该指向一个总的目标，那就是要为实现1960年的棉粮生产计划而奋斗。部门工作和中心工作不是平起平坐的关系，而是局部和整体的关系；作好中心工作，不但不会影响部门工作，恰恰相反，只有中心工作跃进了，部门工作才能跃进。“二五制”就是保证中心工作和部门工作齐跃进的好方法。
    在思想认识统一的基础上，各部门都根据为中心工作服务同时兼顾本身工作的原则，重新调配了干部的力量，安排了自己的工作，普遍地执行了“二五制”的各项规定。这样作虽然还只有短短的几个月，但是已经收到了以下几项明显的效果。
    第一，切实地加强了农业生产的领导力量。据统计，自实行“二五制”以来，全县各级和各部门根据不同情况，抽调出来经常深入生产第一线工作的干部有二千五百四十五人，占干部总数的87％，比实行“二五制”以前增加了40％多。在这批干部中，有相当一部分固定包队，一年不动；其余的也是通过中心工作来搞部门工作。全县八百一十六个生产队，平均每个队有脱离生产的干部二至三人；两千九百六十个生产小队，加上生产队的干部，达到了每个小队都有包队干部。这批干部形成了一支强大的农业生产指挥力量。他们驻扎在生产第一线，一手抓生产，一手抓生活，双手抓政治，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，同群众建立和保持着密切的联系，从而引起了农村工作一系列的深刻变化。
    最为突出的是，各级干部深入生产第一线后，问题的发现和解决及时了、具体了。过去，一个问题从发生、发现到解决，往往要拐几个弯，不但拖延了时间，而且由于领导者对情况的了解多半是间接的，因而解决问题的办法有时就难免不够具体。现在，领导干部来到了第一线，问题一旦发生，不但很快就会被发现和解决，而且由于对情况了解得深透，解决的办法也很具体。如县委书记处书记张寿凯同志，在夏播紧张时期深入到张敖公社工作，发现夏播进度慢，主要原因是劳力使用不集中，副业后勤占的劳力过多，应停的基本建设没有停；也有的队是因为种籽不足。这些问题，张寿凯同志都一一地帮助解决了，种籽问题，用清仓和互相调剂等办法，筹集了七万多斤，基本上满足了需要；夏播劳力问题，通过算细账、挖潜力，由原来的五千人增加到一万二千人，大大地加快了夏播进度。全公社九万亩夏播任务，原计划七天完成，结果四天就完成了。张寿凯同志在这个公社发现的问题和解决这些问题的经验，通过县委召开的电话会议传到各公社以后，对推动全县的夏播工作起了很大作用。全县搞农业的劳力由原来占劳力总数的64％增加到75％，夏播劳力由六万五千人增加到十二万多人；同时还通过清仓、调换等办法，筹集了五十多万斤种籽，解决了种籽不足的问题，使全县的夏播进度提高了一倍多。
    第二，各级干部特别是领导干部深入第一线以后，都给队干部当参谋，替他们出主意想办法，帮助他们改进了领导作风和工作方法，有效地提高了基层干部的水平。全县原有三类支部一百三十五个，自从县委派出四百三十四名得力的党员干部实行长期包队以来，这些支部的工作面貌正在迅速改变，有六十三个支部已经跃进上去了，有三十四个支部在抗旱运动中成了红旗支部。干部深入下去以后，对工作比较先进的支部也起了很大的促进作用。如县委办公室副主任何文立、调研科长范友珍等，到城关公社双刘店大队第二小队工作，通过和队干部一起研究，实行了“七、一二四制”（即一周中的七天，白天队干部全部参加劳动，一个晚上休息，两个晚上研究工作，四个晚上和群众一起学习）和“学、干、研、碰”的工作方法，解决了实行“二五制”后小队干部如何工作的问题，使这个队的生产出现了更大跃进的局面。这一工作方法经县委在全县推广以后，全县各生产小队的领导水平普遍地提高了一步。他们的工作作到了更加有计划，既能把主要的时间用于参加生产领导生产，也有时间学习党的方针政策和科学技术。
    第三，各部门特别是工业、财贸、文教部门的干部，由于深入了生产第一线，及时地和更好地了解了群众生产和生活方面的需要，因而更进一步明确了为生产、为政治、为群众服务的三大观点，更好地服务和支援了农业生产。如银行贷款，过去要经过申请、调查、批准、发放四道手续。现在银行干部带着业务深入生产队工作，队里缺款不缺款，他们心里有底。因而凡是需要贷款的，很快就能得到解决。如银行行长米新维同志下到景州公社第三管理区第二生产队工作，发现有两台机器闲着不用，原因是没有钱买煤。他立即帮助贷来一笔现款，使两台机器开动起来，投入了紧张的抗旱斗争。再如商业局副局长刘耀庭同志，5月上旬到刘集公社中心商店工作，同售货员一起到七里庄售货。当时正准备夏收夏种，他发现这个队的夏收夏种的工具准备不够好，而中心商店的商品也不齐全。他立即把这一情况反映给县局，县局又立即通知各中心商店了解各生产队夏收夏种工具的准备情况，结果发现有三百多个队缺少工具。于是县局一面清仓库，组织内部互相调剂，一面组织采购。经过十天突击，共增加了各种工具三十余种、四十二万多件，及时解决了夏收夏种中的物资供应问题。工业部门也更及时直接地支持了农业生产。在抗旱中他们曾进行了四次修配工作大突击，组织技术工人进队、进方田给社员修配机器和农具。据四个月的统计，共修配各种机器、农具十四万多件，改革了提水工具和各种小农具一万五千多件。他们还在下乡修配中，总结出一套保管和提高机器利用率的三有（有机房、机座、零件）四定（定地点、人员、任务和检修）管理制度，在全县推广后，全县农业机械的利用率就由40％提高到80％以上。
    第四，各行各业由于进一步明确了发展国民经济以农业为基础的重要意义，所以更大地发挥了支援农业的主动性、自觉性和积极性。现在各行各业支援农业已在全县形成一种新的风气。银行的营业员们，过去下机关、串工厂承办储蓄业务，就算是先进经验。现在他们不但把承办业务的工作带到了生产队、社员家庭去，还在贷款的同时，帮助社、队想生产之道，帮助生产队养猪，改造碱地等。下乡的营业员还每人携带三件工具，到生产队以后，有业务办业务，没业务就参加生产指导生产，给队上修配机器、农具。四个多月，该行经常下乡的一百多名干部就给生产队员修理机器、农具一万多次，给猪打防疫针九万多次。电影队下乡时，也是白天参加生产，晚上放映，还帮助队上修理机器。据三个月的统计，县、社电影队就给生产队修理机器八十七台。文教部门则积极帮助培养技术人材，已在全县建立了六百七十处农民业余技术学校，入学学员达一万七千四百五十九人，他们已经初步懂得了蒸汽机、煤气机、汽油机的操作技术。总之现在全县已经形成一个各行各业支援农业的热潮，开展了作支援农业的尖兵的竞赛运动，从而使今年的农业丰收有了可靠的保证。
