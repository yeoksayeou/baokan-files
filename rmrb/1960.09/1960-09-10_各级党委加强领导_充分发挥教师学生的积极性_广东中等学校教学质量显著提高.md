    Party Committees at All Levels Strengthen Leadership and Fully Mobilize the Enthusiasm of Teachers and Students
    Teaching Quality in Guangdong Secondary Schools Significantly Improved
    (Our Newspaper News) In Guangdong Province's full-time secondary schools, through the strengthening of leadership by Party committees at all levels, further and more comprehensively implementing the Party's education policy and the Party's policy towards intellectuals, and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the vast number of teachers and students, the quality of teaching has significantly improved.
    In the recent college entrance examinations for graduating senior high school students across the province, over 12,000 students achieved passing grades, with over 1,100 students achieving an average score of over 80, a significant increase in the passing rate compared to last year. Meanwhile, according to statistics from 28 counties and cities, the passing rate for graduating junior high school students participating in the province-wide unified graduation examination was over 82%. A significant feature of the improvement in teaching quality in secondary schools across the province is the substantial improvement in the teaching quality of basic subjects and basic knowledge. In the province-wide college entrance examination, the number of people passing the Chinese language (Category A) accounted for 82.3% of the examinees, and the passing rates for politics, physics, and chemistry all exceeded 60%. In the unified examination for graduating junior high school students in 28 counties and cities, the average score for the six subjects of politics, Chinese language, mathematics, physics, chemistry, history, and geography reached 73 points. Another significant feature of the significant improvement in teaching quality is that the originally advanced regions and schools have become even more advanced, and the originally backward regions and schools have also improved, some even leaping into the ranks of the advanced. According to statistics from six counties and cities in the Foshan Special Zone, the average total score of junior high school graduates applying for senior high school increased by 8.1 points compared to last year. The average examination score of each school in Yangjiang County, which was originally relatively backward, reached over 88 points, with the average examination score of Liangyang Middle School reaching over 97 points.
    The primary reason for the significant improvement in teaching quality in secondary schools across the province in such a short period of six months is the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China's emphasis on and strong leadership in education work. In December of last year, a special instruction on education work was issued, putting forward the task of striving to improve teaching quality in every possible way. During the provincial education work conference in February of this year, Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and Qu Mengjue, Secretary of the Secretariat, called on Party organizations at all levels and all education workers in the province to establish ambitious goals, muster their efforts, and strive to fully implement the Party's education policy and rapidly improve teaching quality. Party committees at all levels throughout the province have conscientiously implemented the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee and continue to strengthen their leadership in teaching work.
    Since the provincial education work conference, Party committees at all levels have generally established secretaries for culture and education, established and improved the organizations responsible for education work, and transferred cadres to strengthen the leadership of the cultural and educational front and schools. In the Foshan Special Zone, out of 158 full-time secondary schools, 107 have established Party branches, and 157 have been equipped with Party member principals. Since the beginning of this year, leading cadres for culture and education at all levels across the province have further improved their leadership style, gone deep into the front lines of teaching, promptly summarized teaching experiences, and guided teaching. At the same time, Party branch secretaries, committee members, and principals of all full-time secondary schools generally went deep into teaching and personally took on some courses to lead teaching by participating in teaching. In teaching work, they guide teachers to earnestly do a good job in the main teaching links such as lesson preparation, lecturing, tutoring, grading homework, and assessing grades. In addition, Party leader cadres and teachers in various schools also cultivated large areas of teaching "experimental fields." All these measures have better played the role of Party organizations as fighting fortresses in leading teaching work.
    Another main reason for the rapid improvement in teaching quality is the further and more comprehensive implementation of the Party's education policy. While diligently focusing on teaching work, many schools have generally established school farms and included student participation in labor in the formal curriculum according to the time stipulated by the Provincial Party Committee. Many schools have also conducted experiments in reforming teaching content and methods in accordance with the spirit of the Party's education policy and the principles of teaching reform. At the same time, schools have further implemented the Party's policy on intellectuals, mobilizing the enthusiasm of teachers and giving play to their leading role in teaching. All full-time secondary schools with established Party organizations in the Shantou area regularly organize teachers to attend Party classes, political classes, and study Chairman Mao's works, helping them to continuously improve their political and ideological consciousness and absorbing outstanding members among them into the Party and the League, thereby greatly encouraging the teachers' ambition and work enthusiasm. Since March of this year, various localities have also fully affirmed the teachers' work achievements and commended advanced individuals and advanced deeds among them by selecting representatives to attend the conference of heroes on the cultural and educational front. All these have played a good role in motivating teachers to better improve their political and professional levels. At the same time, full-time secondary schools in various localities have generally strengthened students' political and ideological education, helping them clarify their learning goals, so that they can fully exert their subjective initiative in learning.

    各级党委加强领导　充分发挥教师学生的积极性
    广东中等学校教学质量显著提高
    本报讯　广东省全日制中学，经过各级党委加强领导，进一步全面地贯彻了党的教育方针和党对知识分子的政策，充分发挥了广大师生的积极性，教学质量有了显著提高。
    最近全省高中应届毕业生投考高等学校考试中，成绩及格的达一万二千多人，平均分数在八十分以上的有一千一百多人，及格率比去年大大提高。同时，据二十八个县、市的统计，初中应届毕业生参加全省统一举行的毕业考试，及格率达82％以上。全省中学教学质量提高的一个显著的特点，是基础学科、基础知识的教学质量，有了较大幅度的提高。全省高等学校入学考试，语文甲类及格的人数占投考人数的82.3％，政治、物理、化学的及格率都超过60％。在二十八个县、市初中应届毕业生统考中，政治、语文、数学、物理、化学、史地六科的平均成绩达七十三分。教学质量显著提高的另一个特点是：原来先进的地区和先进的学校更加先进，原来后进的地区和后进的学校也有了提高，有些并且跃进了先进的行列。佛山专区六个县、市的统计，初中毕业生投考高中的成绩，总平均分数比去年提高了八·一分。原来比较后进的阳江县各个中学，期终考试的成绩平均达到八十八分多，其中两阳中学期考成绩平均达到九十七分以上。
    在这短短的半年内，全省中学教学质量得到这样显著的提高，首先是由于中共广东省委对教育工作的重视和坚强领导。去年12月，就特别发出教育工作的指示，提出了千方百计提高教学质量的任务。今年2月全省教育工作会议期间，省委第一书记陶铸和书记处书记区梦觉号召全省各级党组织和全体教育工作者树立雄心壮志，鼓足干劲，为全面贯彻执行党的教育方针，迅速提高教学质量而奋斗。全省各级党委认真贯彻执行了省委的指示，不断加强对教学工作的领导。
    省教育工作会议以后，各级党委普遍设立了文教书记，建立和健全了主管教育工作的机构，抽调干部加强了文教战线和学校的领导工作。佛山专区在一百五十八所全日制中学中，已经有一百零七所建立了党支部，配备了党员校长一百五十七人。今年以来，全省各级文教负责干部进一步改善了领导作风，深入到教学第一线，及时总结教学经验，指导教学。与此同时，各全日制中学的党支部书记、支委、校长普遍深入教学，亲自担任一部分课程，以参加教学来领导教学。在教学工作中引导教师切实做好备课、讲课、辅导、批改作业、考核成绩等主要的教学环节。此外，各校的党员领导干部和教师还大种教学“试验田”。所有这些措施，都更好地发挥了党组织在领导教学工作中的战斗堡垒作用。
    教学质量迅速提高的另一个主要原因，是由于进一步地全面地贯彻了党的教育方针。许多学校在认真抓好教学工作的同时，普遍建立了学校农场，按照省委规定的时间，把学生参加劳动列入正式课程，许多学校还根据党的教育方针的精神和教学改革的原则，作了改革教学内容和教学方法的试验；同时各学校还进一步贯彻了党的知识分子政策，调动教师的积极性，发挥他们在教学中的主导作用。汕头地区建立了党组织的各个全日制中学，都定期组织教师上党课、政治课和学习毛主席的著作，帮助他们不断提高政治思想觉悟，吸收他们中的优秀分子入党入团，从而大大鼓舞了教师们的上进心和工作热情。今年3月以后，各地还通过评选出席文教战线群英会的代表，充分肯定了教师们的工作成绩，表彰了他们中的先进人物和先进事迹。这些都对激发教师们更好地提高政治、业务水平起了良好的作用。与此同时，各地全日制中学普遍地加强了学生的政治思想教育，帮助他们明确学习目的，使他们在学习中充分发挥主观能动性。
