　　Autumn in Mongolia is known as the "golden season," with clear skies, crisp air, and brilliant sunshine; it is also a busy harvest season. We visited the newly reclaimed agricultural and pastoral farm in Selenge Province—the Darhan State-owned Agricultural and Pastoral Farm—during this season filled with the joy of labor.
　　There is a straight and wide road from Ulaanbaatar to the Darhan Agricultural and Pastoral Farm. The car sped along the smooth road, and the vast grasslands on both sides of the road, which were still green a month ago, have now been dyed yellow by the autumn frost. Groups of fat cattle and sheep, golden wheat fields, and newly reclaimed land appear from time to time in the distance and nearby on the grassland. A gentle breeze brings the fragrance of grass and earth.
　　After traveling more than 200 kilometers, we arrived at Darhan, the center of the state-owned agricultural and pastoral farm. This is a small station, and the Friendship Railway connecting Mongolia, China, and the Soviet Union passes through here, making transportation very convenient. Before 1952, this was still a wilderness. After the railway was opened, a station and staff dormitories appeared. In the past two years, with the establishment of the agricultural and pastoral farm, even greater changes have taken place here. Rows of new houses have been built on the flat ground, and it has now become a small town with more than 2,000 people, with shops, hospitals, schools, and nurseries. The farm has built its own offices, staff dormitories, and grain warehouses next to the station.
　　The Darhan Agricultural and Pastoral Farm is one of the four newly built farms based on the Mongolian Party and government's decision to vigorously develop agricultural production. It is close to the Selenge River, with a warm climate and fertile soil, suitable for growing grains. Last year, more than 80 young people from all over the country responded to the call of the Mongolian Party and volunteered to come here to reclaim land and develop agricultural production. Most of the young people were participating in agricultural production for the first time. At that time, the farm had nothing but more than 20 tractors and tents. Relying on their enthusiasm and determination, the young people learned while reclaiming land and quickly mastered the technology. Within a few months, they completed the task of reclaiming more than 20,000 hectares of land.
　　In the spring, the young workers sowed wheat seeds on the newly thawed reclaimed land. In the autumn, the newly reclaimed land yielded its first harvest. Now, most of the wheat fields have been harvested, with an average yield of 14 to 15 quintals per hectare, and the best reaching 28 quintals, greatly exceeding the national target of 9 quintals per hectare.
　　We stayed overnight at the Darhan Guesthouse. The next morning, comrades from the agricultural and pastoral farm led us on a tour. Near the farm site, close to the station, there is a large newly built cement threshing ground, piled with mountains of wheat. Young men and women are busy winnowing and drying the wheat. Comrades from the farm told us that these are students from the Ulaanbaatar Commercial College, who came here to participate in voluntary labor. He pointed to the piles of golden, large-grained, and plump wheat and said happily that these are all seed wheat, ready to be used for sowing in various state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms next spring, and another part will be exported to Hungary, Poland, and other countries.
　　North of the agricultural and pastoral farm, comrades from the Mongolian People's Army who came here to help with the autumn harvest are working intensely. They have maintained the closest contact with the agricultural and pastoral farm since its establishment. They come to help with spring plowing in the spring and now come to help with the autumn harvest. A total of more than 300 People's Army soldiers came to help with the autumn harvest this time, scattered in several production teams. The soldiers brought their own tents and tools, and used their own tools to build a flat threshing ground. Electric wires and lights were erected above the threshing ground for nighttime lighting. They worked in three shifts day and night, not letting the machines stand idle. When we came to visit the threshing ground, the people working the night shift had just gotten off work, and the soldiers on the early shift were working intensely.
　　Why is the autumn harvest work on the agricultural and pastoral farm so intense? Deputy Director Segexi told us that Selenge Province is the most suitable area for developing agriculture in the country, but the frost-free period here is only more than 100 days, and the wheat maturity period is about 90 days, so spring plowing and autumn harvest are very urgent. In order to ensure the completion of this arduous task in a short period of time and prevent the grain from being damaged, each production team launched a production competition, summing up the work achievements of the team and individuals every day, and publicizing advanced figures and advanced experiences, learning from each other, and improving production efficiency. He said that the young people are unwilling to fall behind and are willing to strive for advancement. Some demand themselves according to the national standard for labor heroes, and some strive to become socialist labor teams.
　　The seven agricultural production teams of the farm are all distributed on the large area of land southeast of the farm site. We drove along the wheat fields to the location of the Second Production Team, more than 20 kilometers east of Darhan. The situation here is different from Darhan. There is not a single house, only more than 20 Mongolian yurts and tents for the team members and People's Army soldiers to live in. Everything here is in its initial stage, simple and crude. People take the grassland as their home and devote all their energy to production.
　　At the location of the production team, there is also a mobile carriage like a train car, which is the temporary office of the production team. Outside the carriage hangs a bright red flag, and under the red flag is a wall newspaper, which contains the team members' letters of determination, and the indicators and charts for the team and individuals to complete the production plan. It turns out that the Second Production Team is an advanced production team of the agricultural and pastoral farm, and the winning red flag flying on the carriage is the one awarded to them by the agricultural and pastoral farm.
　　Team Leader Daya warmly received us in the carriage and introduced us to the production situation of the team in detail. This team had only twelve people when it started reclaiming land last year, and now it has increased to thirty-two people due to the busy autumn harvest. The original twelve basic team members are all Party members and Communist Youth League members. They responded to the call of the Party and took the lead in applying to come here to reclaim land. Among them are actors, students, government cadres, and herdsmen. The team leader himself is a famous actor from the Ulaanbaatar National Circus, who has been working at the circus for nineteen years and has visited China twice for performances. The team leader said that this year the production team has sown seeds on more than 3,200 hectares of land, and the wheat is growing particularly well. Originally, the agricultural and pastoral farm required the production team to harvest 15 quintals of wheat per hectare, but now it seems that it can reach more than 20 quintals. The production team has achieved such a good harvest because it has adopted advanced methods such as deep plowing, timely sowing, and cross-sowing. He told us that the production team has accepted the task of striving to become a socialist labor team since September last year, and the team members are determined to use practical actions to strive for this glorious title. We asked him if he would return to the circus in the future. He said that being able to obtain fruitful results on this wilderness through his hard work and realize his wishes is his greatest joy. He loves agricultural production and will always work here.
　　Below the hillside is the threshing ground of this production team, which is much larger than the two threshing grounds we saw earlier. Piles of wheat and sacks filled with wheat are scattered on the threshing ground. Several dust-removing and sorting machines are constantly rolling. People put the winnowed wheat into sacks and are busy unloading and drying cart after cart of wheat just brought from the fields. On a high架架next to the threshing ground, a photographer is capturing the scene on the field into the lens.
　　The wheat fields near the threshing ground are piled with wheat ears harvested a few days ago, drying in the fields. Several harvesters are threshing. We ran into the wheat field and saw that the wheat grains were full and the wheat was growing really well. A harvester drove towards us and stopped in front of us. This was driven by young team member Sangjia. He greeted us warmly. Sangjia was one of the twelve team members who came last year. He only learned to drive a combine harvester before the autumn harvest, and now he can complete the task of harvesting 30 hectares of wheat every day. He told us with confidence that he would work hard with all the team members to achieve the goal of becoming a socialist labor team in November.
　　We stood on the high ground in the wheat field and looked out. The threshing ground was a golden expanse, the trucks carrying wheat were running back and forth on the road, and the harvesters were constantly harvesting wheat in the fields. All of this formed a magnificent picture of a bumper harvest.
　　The agricultural and pastoral farm now has more than 300 workers, 92% of whom are young people. The young workers have only been on the farm for a short time, and now each of them has mastered two or more agricultural machines. Many young people have become advanced workers. Zhagda, a young female worker from the Sixth Production Team, is one of them. This 20-year-old female tractor driver was still a herdsman last year and only came to the agricultural and pastoral farm in January this year. She created an excellent record of harvesting 87 hectares of wheat in one day, breaking the farm's highest production record.
　　We came to the wheat field of the Sixth Production Team and visited this advanced female worker. Zhagda was driving a harvester to harvest wheat in the wheat field. Seeing the guests coming, she stopped the machine and came over to shake hands with us. She is not tall, wearing a blue work suit, and a pair of bright eyes on her dark, healthy face shone with the light of youth. We congratulated her on her achievements, and she humbly expressed that she would continue to improve her skills. She said that she loved riding horses since she was a child, and she wanted to respond to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and skillfully master her machine like taming a horse.
　　At this time, the secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of the agricultural and pastoral farm, who accompanied us on the visit, introduced Zhagda's production experience to us, pointing out that the reason why she achieved such outstanding results was because she cherished the machine, the machine did not break down, and she worked non-stop. She did not leave the wheat field from morning to night, completing the tasks assigned to her with a high sense of responsibility. Zhagda listened and smiled shyly.
　　The agricultural and pastoral farm has more than 20,000 hectares of cultivated land, one piece after another. We took a car tour and visited for more than three hours, only visiting a corner of the agricultural and pastoral farm. The vast wheat fields stretched as far as the eye could see. The harvest on the newly reclaimed land and the profound changes in the grassland left us with an unforgettable impression. This is only the second year of reclamation, and the agricultural and pastoral farm still has its unlimited development prospects. Comrade Badar, the director of the farm, told us that they will continue to reclaim land next year. The state has recently allocated more than 10,000 livestock to the agricultural and pastoral farm, and its development direction is to attach equal importance to agriculture and animal husbandry, and also to develop sideline production. According to the plan of Mongolia's Third Five-Year Plan, the Darhan area will become Mongolia's emerging industrial base. The development of the agricultural and pastoral farm will be linked to the future of Darhan, with industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry supporting each other, and the prospects are infinitely bright.

　　新星地上大丰收
　　玉书
    蒙古的秋天是有名的“金色季节”，秋高气爽，阳光灿烂；同时又是繁忙的收获季节。我们就在这充满了劳动喜悦的季节里，访问了色楞格省的新垦农牧场——达尔罕国营农牧场。
    从乌兰巴托到达尔罕农牧场，有一条笔直宽广的公路。汽车在平整的路面上奔驰，公路两旁辽阔的草原，一个月前，还是碧绿的，现在已被秋霜染黄了。草原的远方近处不时出现一群群肥胖的牛羊、一片片金黄色的麦田和新垦地。微风吹过，送来阵阵草和泥土的芳香。
    车行二百多公里，到达了国营农牧场的中心地——达尔罕。这里是一个小车站，联接蒙中苏三国的友谊铁路通过这里，交通很方便。1952年以前，这里还是一片荒野，铁路通车以后，出现了车站和职工宿舍。最近两年，随着农牧场的建立，这里发生了更大的变化，平地上建起了一排排的新房屋，现在已成为一个有二千多人口的小镇，有商店、医院、学校和托儿所等。农场就在车站旁边盖了自己的办公室、职工宿舍和谷物仓库。
    达尔罕农牧场，是根据蒙古党和政府大力发展农业生产的决定新建的四个农场之一，靠近色楞格河，气候温暖，土质肥沃，适于种植谷物。去年，全国各地八十多名青年，响应蒙古党的号召，志愿来这里垦荒，发展农业生产。青年们大多数是第一次参加农业生产的。当时，农场除了二十多台拖拉机和帐篷外，什么也没有。青年们凭着他们的热情和决心，边学习，边开荒，很快掌握了技术。几个月内，就完成了开荒两万多公顷的任务。
    春天，青年职工们，在刚刚解冻的新垦地上，播下了小麦种子。秋天，新垦地第一次获得了丰收。现在，大部分麦田都已收割完毕，平均每公顷产量可达十四公担到十五公担，最好的达二十八公担，大大超过了国家规定的每公顷九公担的指标。
    我们在达尔罕招待所里住了一夜。第二天清晨，农牧场的同志领我们参观。农牧场场址附近，靠近车站的地方，有一大片新修的水门汀打麦场，堆积着如山的麦子，青年男女们正在忙碌地扬场，翻晒麦子。农场的同志告诉我们，这是乌兰巴托商业专科学校的学生，他们来这里参加义务劳动。他指着那一堆堆金黄色的颗粒肥大、饱满的麦子高兴地说，这都是留种的麦子，准备供各国营农牧场明春播种用，另一部分将出口到匈牙利、波兰等国。
    农牧场北边，来这里帮助秋收的蒙古人民军的同志们，正在紧张地工作。他们从建场起就和农牧场保持着最密切的联系，春天来帮助春耕，现在又来帮助秋收。这次来帮助秋收的人民军战士共有三百多人，分散在几个生产队工作。战士们带来了自己的帐篷和工具，并用自己的工具修了一块平整的打麦场。在打麦场的上空，架起了电线和电灯，供夜间照明用。他们日夜三班工作，不让机器闲着。我们来到打麦场参观的时候，夜班工作的人刚下班不久，早班的战士正在紧张地工作。
    农牧场的秋收工作为什么这样紧张？副场长色格西告诉我们，色楞格省是全国最适于发展农业的一个地区，但这里的无霜期也只有一百多天，麦子成熟期约九十多天，因此春耕和秋收都是十分紧迫的。为了保证在短期内完成这个繁重任务，不使粮食受到损失，各生产队展开了生产竞赛，每天总结队和个人的工作成绩，公布先进人物和先进经验，互相学习，提高生产效率。他说，青年们都不愿落后，都愿争先进，有的按国家规定的劳动英雄标准要求自己，有的争取成为社会主义劳动队。
    农场的七个农业生产队都分布在场址东南的大片土地上，我们沿着麦田驱车来到达尔罕以东二十多公里处的第二生产队所在地。这里的情况和达尔罕不一样，没有一所房子，只有二十多个供队员和人民军战士住宿的蒙古包和帐篷，这里的一切都是初创，因陋就简，人们以草原为家，把全部精力投入生产。
    在生产队的所在地，还有一个像火车车厢似的流动车厢，这是生产队的临时办公室。车厢的外面挂着一幅鲜艳的红旗，红旗下面贴着墙报，墙报上有队员们的决心书，有队和个人完成生产计划的指标和图表。原来第二生产队是农牧场的先进生产队，车厢上飘扬着的优胜红旗就是农牧场奖给他们的。
    生产队队长达亚在车厢里热情地接待了我们，并且向我们详细地介绍了这个队的生产情况。这个队去年开始垦荒时只有十二个人，现在秋收繁忙，增加到三十二人。原来的十二个基本队员都是党团员，他们响应党的号召，率先申请来这里开荒。他们中有演员、学生、机关干部和牧民，队长本人就是乌兰巴托国家马戏院的著名演员，在马戏院工作已经十九年了，曾经两次到中国访问演出。队长说，今年生产队在三千二百多公顷土地上播了种，麦子长得特别好，原来农牧场要求生产队每公顷收小麦十五公担，现在看来，可以达到二十多公担。生产队得到这样的丰收，是因为采取了深耕、及时播种和交叉播种等先进方法。他告诉我们，生产队从去年9月起，已接受了争取社会主义劳动队的任务，队员们都决心要用实际行动来争取这个光荣称号。我们问他，以后还回到马戏院去吗？他说，能够用自己辛勤的劳动在这片荒野上获得丰收的果实，实现他的愿望，是他最大的高兴，他喜爱农业生产，将永远在这里工作下去。
    山坡下就是这个生产队的打麦场，比我们先前看到的两个打麦场要大得多。麦场上散放着一堆堆麦子和装满麦子的麻袋。几台扬尘分类机不停地滚动着。人们把扬净的麦子盛进麻袋，又忙着把一车车刚从地里运来的麦子卸下翻晒。在麦场旁边的一个高架子上，摄影师正在把场上的景象，摄入镜头。
    麦场附近的麦田，堆积着早些日子割下的麦穗，在田里晒干。好几台收割机正在脱粒。我们跑到麦田里，看到麦粒饱满，麦子长得真好。一台收割机迎面开来，在我们面前停下了。这是青年队员桑加驾驶的。他向我们热情地打招呼。桑加是去年来的十二个队员之一，秋收前才学会驾驶联合收割机，现在每天能够完成收割三十公顷麦子的任务了。他满怀信心地告诉我们，他要和全队队员一起努力，争取在11月实现社会主义劳动队的目标。
    我们站在麦田高处了望，打麦场上一片金黄，载运麦子的汽车在路上来回奔驰，收割机在田野里不停地割麦，这一切，组成了一幅多么壮丽的丰收图景。
    农牧场现在共有三百多名工人，92％都是青年。年青的工人们，来场不久，现在每个人已能掌握两种或两种以上的农业机器了。许多青年成了先进工人。第六生产队的年青女工扎格达就是其中之一。这位二十岁的女拖拉机手，去年还是牧民，今年1月才来到农牧场的，她创造了一天割麦八十七公顷的优良成绩，打破了全场最高的生产纪录。
    我们来到第六生产队的麦田里，访问了这位先进女工。扎格达正驾驶着收割机在麦田里割麦。看到客人来了，停下机器，走来和我们握手。她身材不高，穿着一身蓝色工作服，发黑的健康的面孔上，一对明亮的眼睛，闪耀着青春的光芒。我们祝贺她取得的成就，她谦逊地表示，还要继续提高自己的技术。她说，她从小就爱骑马，她要响应团中央的号召，像驯服马一样，熟练地掌握自己的机器。
    这时，陪我们一同访问的农牧场青年团团委书记，向我们介绍扎格达的生产经验，指出她所以获得如此优异的成绩，是由于她爱惜机器，机器不出故障，不停顿的工作，她从早到晚不离开麦田，以高度的责任感完成交给她的任务。扎格达听着，腼腆的笑了。
    农牧场的两万多公顷耕地，一片接着一片，我们乘车巡回参观，整整跑了三个多小时，只是参观了农牧场的一角。浩瀚的麦田，一眼望不到边。新垦地上的丰收，草原的深刻变化，给我们留下难忘的印象。这只是垦荒的第二年，农牧场还有它无限的发展远景。场长巴达尔同志对我们说，明年，还要继续垦荒。国家最近又拨给农牧场一万多头牲畜，它的发展方向是农牧业并重，还要发展副业生产。根据蒙古第三个五年计划的规划，达尔罕地区将成为蒙古的新兴工业基地。农牧场的发展，将和达尔罕的未来联系起来，工、农、牧业相互支援，前景是无限美好的。（附图片）
