　　Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, September 28th: Mongolian herdsmen of the Xingfu Zhi Lu People's Commune in Balinyou Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, relying on the power of the People's Commune, have changed the situation of solely engaging in animal husbandry production, implemented diversified operations that focus on animal husbandry, combine agriculture and animal husbandry, and further changed the production and living conditions of the pastoral areas.

　　The Xingfu Zhi Lu People's Commune is located in the northern mountainous region of Balinyou Banner. In the past, the herdsmen here only engaged in animal husbandry and did not grow crops. Due to the lack of agricultural production, not only did the herdsmen's food rely on external support, but also livestock feed was sometimes lacking. In 1956, the herdsmen here organized production cooperatives and, relying on collective strength, began to reclaim wasteland for farming. However, due to the small size and limited strength of the cooperatives, the water source problem could not be solved, and the sown area was not large. The establishment of the People's Commune in 1958 created favorable conditions for changing the single animal husbandry economy. The commune's Party committee, based on the residential situation of the herdsmen, established settlements centered on the commune, production team, and small team, and led all the herdsmen who had not yet settled down to achieve settlement. Then, according to the grassland pasture, soil, and water source conditions, pastures and farmland were divided; various specialized production teams and groups were established in each production brigade, so that the production policy of focusing on animal husbandry, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and vigorously developing industry, forestry, and sideline occupations was fully implemented.

　　When the commune's Party committee led the commune members to comprehensively develop production, it first focused on water conservancy construction based on the water shortage in the grassland. In the autumn of 1958, shortly after the commune was established, it relied on the strength of the large collective to dig wells, build canals, and vigorously engage in water conservancy construction. By the following year, the herdsmen had drilled nearly two hundred wells in the waterless grassland and built canals to gather river water, spring water, and well water together for power generation and irrigation. Because the water source was opened up, creating conditions for the development of agriculture, the commune organized a large number of laborers to reclaim wasteland for farming. In order to help herdsmen learn farming techniques, the commune first established a large-scale feed base of more than 6,000 mu, allowing herdsmen from production teams and small teams to take turns learning farming, so that production teams and small teams could also establish their own agricultural bases. By last year, the agricultural sowing area of the entire commune had increased from several thousand mu before communization to more than 16,000 mu, and the grain output reached more than 2.25 million jin, achieving self-sufficiency in grain and livestock feed for the first time. Not only did it not require the state to supply grain that year, but it also sold more than 200,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. This year, under the guidance of the idea of agriculture as the foundation, the sowing area of the entire commune has been expanded to more than 25,000 mu.

　　After initially solving the problem of water shortage in the grassland, animal husbandry, industry, and forestry in the Xingfu Zhi Lu People's Commune have also been greatly developed. Now, all pastures in the entire commune have achieved well-networked management, all livestock drink well water, which has effectively controlled the occurrence of various diseases. This year, the lamb survival rate reached 99%, which is higher than any previous year. In industrial production, the commune has established eighteen small factories, such as grain processing, iron and wood repair, centered on the hydropower station. In the past, no trees were planted on the grassland. After the establishment of the commune, in addition to establishing a nursery of more than 100 mu, it also carried out year-round afforestation. At present, the afforestation area has reached more than 1,000 mu.

　　The development of agriculture and industry in the commune has also promoted the great development of animal husbandry production. Last spring, the commune's animal husbandry suffered from more than three consecutive months of snowstorms, and more than 5,000 head of weak livestock in the entire commune were at risk of death. However, because the commune developed agriculture and had sufficient feed and fodder, this group of weak livestock safely survived the cold wind and heavy snow after the commune members' careful feeding. After the great development of agriculture in the pastoral areas, the commune members mainly eat grain in their lives, and the slaughter of livestock has also been greatly reduced, which has further expanded the reproduction of animal husbandry. In the past, the production tools such as iron shovels needed for animal husbandry production here had to be purchased from other places, but now the commune's iron and wood repair factory can produce them itself.

　　After the Xingfu Zhi Lu Commune changed the single animal husbandry economy, the lives of the herdsmen gradually improved. Now, the living standards of all the poor herdsmen in the entire commune have reached the level of prosperous herders in the past. (Attached picture)

    以牧为主　农牧结合　多种经营　全面发展
　　牧区人民公社五业并举畜旺粮丰
　  巴林右旗幸福之路公社口粮和饲料自给有余，羊羔成活率达99％，社办工厂十八座，造林一千多亩，社员生活达到富裕牧户水平
    据新华社呼和浩特28日电　内蒙古自治区巴林右旗幸福之路人民公社蒙古族牧民，依靠人民公社的威力，改变了单营畜牧业生产的状况，实行了以牧为主、农牧结合的多种经营，进一步改变了牧区生产和生活面貌。
    幸福之路人民公社位于巴林右旗北部山区。过去，这里的牧民只经营牧业，不种庄稼。由于没有发展农业生产，不仅牧民们的口粮要依靠外地支援，就是牲畜的饲料，有时也感缺乏。1956年，这里的牧民组织了生产合作社，依靠集体的力量，开始进行开荒种田。但是由于社小力薄，解决不了水源问题，播种面积不大。1958年人民公社的成立，为改变单一畜牧业经济创造了有利条件。公社党委根据牧民居住情况，以公社、生产队、小队为中心建立起定居点，领导没有定居下来的牧民全部实现了定居。然后按照草原牧草、土壤和水源情况，划分牧场、农田；各个生产大队成立起各项专业生产队和小组，使以牧业为主、农牧结合和大力发展工业、林业、副业的多种经营生产方针得到了全面贯彻。
    公社党委在领导社员全面发展生产时，根据草原缺水的情况，首先抓住了水利建设。1958年秋季，公社刚刚成立不久，便依靠大集体的力量，打井、修渠，大兴水利建设，到了第二年牧民们便在无水的草原上，打上近两百眼水井，兴修了渠道，把河水、泉水和井水汇集在一起，进行发电和灌溉。由于开辟了水源，为发展农业创造了条件，公社便组织大批劳力开荒种田。为了帮助牧民学会种地的技术，公社先建立了一个六千多亩的大型饲料基地，让生产队和小队的牧民轮流学习种地，以便使生产队和小队也建立自己的农业基地。到去年全社农业播种面积，便由公社化前的几千亩增加到一万六千多亩，粮食产量达到二百二十五万多斤，第一次实现了粮食和牲畜饲料自给有余，这年不仅没有要国家供应粮食，还卖给国家二十多万斤余粮。今年在以农业为基础的思想指导下，全社播种面积又扩大到两万五千多亩。
    幸福之路人民公社在初步解决草原缺水问题以后，畜牧业、工业和林业也得到大发展。现在全社牧场全部实现井网化，所有牲畜都饮井水，有力地控制了各种疾病的发生，今年羊羔成活率达到99％，比以往任何一年都高。在工业生产上，公社以水力发电站为中心，建立了粮食加工、铁木修配等十八座小型工厂。从前草原上不种植树木，公社成立后，除建立一个上百亩的苗圃外，还进行常年植树造林，目前造林面积已达一千多亩。
    公社农业和工业的发展，又促进了畜牧业生产的大发展。去年春天，公社畜牧业遭到连续三个多月的风雪灾害，全社有五千多头瘦弱牲畜有死亡危险。但是由于公社发展了农业，有了充足的饲料和饲草，经过社员们精心饲喂，这批瘦弱牲畜都安全地度过了这场寒风大雪。牧区农业大发展以后，公社社员在生活上以吃粮食为主，宰杀牲畜也大为减少，这样又进一步扩大了畜牧业的再生产。过去这里畜牧业生产上需要的铁锹等生产工具，要到外地购买，现在公社铁木修配厂能自己生产。
    幸福之路公社在改变了单一畜牧业经济后，牧民生活逐步得到改善，现在全社的贫困牧民，都已达到过去富裕牧户的生活水平。（附图片）
