Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from Asuncion: Paraguayan anti-dictatorship guerrillas are actively engaged in activities.

It is reported that on Yacyretá Island, opposite the Argentine town of Ituzaingó on the Paraná River, a guerrilla squad recently attacked the government garrison stationed there. This government force consisted of 400 men and controlled an airfield. The guerrillas seized many weapons from the government troops.

At the same time, in the heavily guarded capital of Asuncion, many commando teams have emerged. These commando teams often attack government patrols and guards. Recently, one commando team disarmed two police officers.

Throughout the country, many new guerrilla teams have been formed and are actively engaged in activities. Although the Paraguayan dictatorial regime's Ministry of Interior has repeatedly fabricated lies that the guerrillas have been eliminated, according to a report broadcast by the Ministry of Interior via radio, a peasant guerrilla squad is operating in the Yaguarón area, 80 kilometers southeast of Asuncion. The same source also confirmed that guerrilla squads are also operating in the Arroyos y Esteros-Limpio area, and the dictatorial government is concentrating a large number of troops in this area to deal with the threat posed by the guerrillas. Faced with an increasingly intense armed struggle against the dictatorship, the Stroessner dictatorial regime is intensifying its frantic suppression. On August 10, in Asuncion, members of the National Liberation United Front, an anti-dictatorship left-wing coalition, were attacked by police while holding a meeting. Those attending the meeting fired back at the police, and one person was wounded in the fighting. Some members of the National United Liberation Front were arrested because they were outnumbered.

The dictatorial regime also recently murdered Antonio Alonso Ramírez, one of the leaders of the Paraguayan Communist Party. He was the leader of the "Victory or Death" guerrilla detachment (belonging to the National Liberation United Front) operating in the Ivityrusú Mountains, 25 kilometers from the city of Villarrica. Antonio Alonso Ramírez was arrested in a village near the Ivityrusú Mountains on July 23 and subsequently taken to Charara, 40 kilometers from Villarrica, where he was subjected to fatal torture. At the same time, Juana Peralta, a female nurse in the "Sentinel" column of guerrillas belonging to the National Liberation United Front, also died from torture in the Charara area. The crimes committed by the dictatorial regime against guerrilla fighters and Paraguayan patriots have aroused a wave of angry protests among the Paraguayan people. In order to maintain its dying rule, the Stroessner dictatorial regime announced on August 29 that it would once again extend martial law throughout Paraguay for another ninety days.

    巴拉圭反独裁武装斗争活跃
    游击队在全国各地不断袭击反动政府军警
    独裁政权慌忙宣布再延长戒严状态九十天
    新华社7日讯　亚松森消息：巴拉圭反独裁游击队正在积极展开活动。
    据报道，在巴拉那河阿根廷的伊图萨因戈镇对面的亚西雷塔岛，一个游击小队最近袭击了在那里驻防的政府卫戍部队，这批政府军共有四百人并且控制着一个飞机场。游击队缴获了政府军的许多枪枝。
    同时，在戒备森严的首都亚松森，也出现了许多突击队，这些突击队常常袭击政府的巡逻队和警卫队，最近有一支突击队解除了两名警官的武装。
    在全国各地，许多新的游击队已经组成并且在积极开展活动。巴拉圭独裁政权的内政部虽然一再制造游击队已被消灭的谎言，但是，根据内政部用无线电播发的报告，一支农民游击小队在亚松森东南八十公里的亚瓜龙地区活动。根据同一来源还证实，在阿罗约斯·埃斯特罗斯—利姆皮奥地区也有游击小队在活动，独裁政府正向这个地区大量集中部队，以对付游击队的威胁。面临着日益剧烈的反独裁武装斗争，斯特罗斯纳独裁政权加紧进行疯狂的镇压。8月10日在亚松森，反独裁左派联合组织民族解放联合阵线的成员在开会的时候，遭到了警察的袭击。开会的人对警察开枪抵抗，并有一人在战斗中负伤。民族联合解放阵线的成员因为寡不敌众有一些人被逮捕。
    独裁政权最近还杀害了巴拉圭共产党领导人之一安东尼奥·阿隆索·拉米雷斯。他是在距维拉利卡城二十五公里的伊维蒂芦苏山地活动的名为“不胜利毋宁死”的游击支队（属于民族解放联合阵线）的领袖。安东尼奥·阿隆索·拉米雷斯于7月23日在伊维蒂芦苏山地附近的一个村庄被捕，随后被解往距维拉利卡四十公里的查拉拉，在那里受到了致命的酷刑。同时属于民族解放联合阵线的名为“哨兵”纵队的游击队中的一位女护士胡安娜·佩拉耳塔也在查拉拉地区受酷刑的折磨致死。独裁政权对游击队员和巴拉圭爱国者所犯的罪行在巴拉圭人民中引起了抗议的怒潮。斯特罗斯纳独裁政权为了维持它的垂死的统治，在8月29日宣布再次在巴拉圭全国延长戒严状态九十天。
