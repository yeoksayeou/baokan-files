This dispatch from Nanning, September 21st: Guangxi is actively promoting the use of weeding machines. Incomplete statistics from the four regions of Liuzhou, Yulin, Nanning, and Wuzhou alone show that more than 1.4 million weeding machines have been manufactured and repaired. Many communes and production brigades have achieved one machine per laborer. Using weeding machines improves work efficiency by one to two times compared to manual weeding and provides more meticulous work.

This year, many late rice crops in Guangxi were planted using rice transplanters. The even spacing between plants created favorable conditions for using weeding machines. Therefore, while concentrating labor and strengthening field management, Party committees at all levels in Guangxi have prioritized the universal promotion and use of weeding machines to improve weeding speed and quality. This is seen as an important measure to boost grain production, and they have emphasized the need to focus on weeding machines with the same determination as they did on rice transplanters. As the rush to transplant late rice neared completion, the Nanning region sent work teams to Ningming, Binyang, and other counties to gather opinions on weeding machines, evaluate different models, resolve technical and raw material issues in manufacturing, and designate the manufacturing of weeding machines as the primary task of industrial departments in supporting agriculture. In the Liuzhou region, counties and communes divided the labor, with county factories producing iron parts and communes producing wooden parts, linking factories with communes. In a short time, a large number of weeding machines were manufactured and repaired, ensuring timely supply for the fields.

Like the promotion of rice transplanters, leading cadres of Party committees at all levels became pioneers in promoting the use of weeding machines. On August 22nd, Qin Xiting, First Secretary of the Hengxian County Party Committee, along with county secretary Su Yan and Liu Hongbiao, director of the county Party committee's rural affairs department, led twelve weeding hands in the first use of weeding machines in the Xinqiaodong of Caocun Commune. Mo Jimao, an old man who passed by, saw that they had weeded a large area in the blink of an eye, easily and quickly, and repeatedly praised them. He also asked Secretary Qin for a machine to take back as a model for imitation. The news of the county secretary leading the use of weeding machines spread like wildfire throughout the Caocun Commune, mobilizing the entire commune. The commune Party committee immediately convened a "Hundred-Person Performance and Internship Meeting" and concentrated 256 carpenters to step up production.

Guangxi has paid special attention to adapting the use of weeding machines to local conditions in order to fully utilize the effectiveness of this new type of agricultural tool. Huanjiang County adopted a "four-in-one" approach, combining secretaries, cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers to study the performance of various weeding machines and different soil types through hands-on operation, and found methods for using weeding machines according to field conditions.

This dispatch from Shenyang, September 21st: In order to make autumn harvesting fast, comprehensive, clean, and efficient, people's communes in Tieling County, Shenyang City, are vigorously manufacturing and promoting the powered universal threshing machine created by Li Shengzhu, a member of the Diyunsuo People's Commune, striving to achieve mechanized autumn harvesting and threshing, and comprehensively improve threshing efficiency.

Tieling County in Shenyang City is one of the main grain-producing areas in Liaoning Province, rich in corn, sorghum, rice, soybeans, wheat, and other grain crops. In the past, except for rice threshing which used foot-operated threshing machines, the threshing of general grain crops relied on manual operation, which was very inefficient. The threshing period usually lasted about two months, which not only deepened the contradiction of insufficient labor and animal power but also affected autumn plowing, autumn planting, and the timely storage of grain. This year, the county has more than 84,000 hectares of autumn-harvested crops. If manual operation methods are still used, more than 750,000 man-days and 252,000 animal-days will be needed. Even if all efforts are concentrated on threshing, it will still take 25 to 30 days to complete. Therefore, solving the problem of mechanized autumn threshing is a key to comprehensively completing the "three autumns" production tasks.

This powered universal threshing machine was developed by Li Shengzhu, a member of the Diyunsuo People's Commune, under the leadership of the Tieling County Party Committee, after many trials. This powered universal threshing machine consists of six parts: a frame, conveyor belt, threshing roller, fan, impurity removal screen, and traveling wheels. From threshing to winnowing, everything is mechanized, and work efficiency is very high. Powered by a 15 to 25 horsepower electric motor or diesel engine and operated by 20 people, it can thresh more than 50,000 kilograms of grain every ten hours, equivalent to the workload of 200 people operating 29 foot-operated rice threshers for one day. This machine is a comprehensive threshing machine with three sets of screens: one for threshing beans and corn, one for threshing wheat, rice, and sorghum, and one for threshing millet, barnyard grass, and foxtail millet. By simply changing the screens, it can be used for threshing various grain crops, replacing multiple threshing tools and comprehensively improving threshing efficiency. This threshing machine also has the characteristics of thorough threshing and thorough winnowing. According to actual tests, it can reduce grain loss by more than 50 kilograms per hectare compared to foot-operated rice threshers and field threshing using stone rollers. In addition, this threshing machine has the characteristics of simple structure, easy manufacturing, low cost, and convenient movement. Except for the shafts, transmission wheels, and traveling wheels, which are made of iron, most of the machine is made of wood, requiring only 1.9 cubic meters of timber (finished product). General county and commune agricultural tool factories can manufacture it, or iron parts can be made by county and commune agricultural tool factories, wooden parts can be made by carpenters from each production team, and then assembled uniformly. The total cost is only about 1,200 yuan. Traveling wheels are installed under the machine body, making it very easy to move. After completing the threshing task in one threshing ground, it can be moved to another threshing ground for continued threshing work with power traction.

Because this threshing machine has the above characteristics, the Tieling County Party Committee decided to promote it universally. At present, various communes are accelerating manufacturing.

This dispatch from Kunming, September 21st: Yunnan Province is focusing on both manufacturing and repairing, actively preparing autumn agricultural tools. Currently, the province has produced more than 26,200 threshing machines and corn shellers, and more than 263,000 pieces/units of deep plows, seeders, and harvesters, as well as more than 16 million small agricultural tools.

As early as mid-June, the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee convened a provincial agricultural work conference to arrange the production and supply of autumn agricultural tools for this year. According to the provincial Party committee's arrangements, while actively producing mechanized and semi-mechanized agricultural tools, all localities paid special attention to the production of small agricultural tools in order to comprehensively meet the needs of autumn production. More than 90 counties and more than 1,300 people's commune agricultural tool factories across the province have投入 (put into) this battle. In addition to rushing to produce large agricultural tools such as threshing machines and deep plows, employees of agricultural tool factories in Yuanjiang County also prepared five small agricultural tools (hoes, sickles, straw raincoats, rain hats, machetes) for each laborer in the county. Employees of agricultural tool factories in Lufeng County launched a labor competition. The daily output of threshing machines increased more than threefold compared to the original, and the production tasks for new autumn agricultural tools in the county have been basically completed, and old agricultural tools have also been fully repaired.

Another feature of the autumn agricultural tool preparation work in Yunnan Province is the general improvement in the quality of agricultural tool products. Agricultural tool factories in various counties of the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture took the initiative to undertake the production of threshing machines, shellers, and other agricultural tools with higher technical requirements, and assigned the production of general small agricultural tools to commune agricultural tool factories. In this way, agricultural tools were made in large quantities and of good quality. The Luoping County Agricultural Tool Factory took the initiative to send technicians and veteran workers to test the newly manufactured threshing machines in the fields first, soliciting opinions from threshing machine operators, and then returning to the factory to make improvements. Finally, batches were produced only after passing joint appraisal by workers, farmers, and technicians, so as to ensure that each manufactured piece was qualified and that each piece leaving the factory was guaranteed for use, making both workers and farmers satisfied. After technical innovation, the Yu江 (missing radical on 江) County Agricultural Machinery Factory doubled the output of threshing machines, and increased the speed of the threshing machines from more than 200 revolutions per minute to more than 400 revolutions per minute. The cost of main products was also reduced by half.

While focusing on manufacturing, various localities also transferred a large number of technical personnel to form repair teams, which went deep into various management areas and production teams to repair old agricultural tools. The Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, which had already started autumn harvesting, organized more than 1,700 repair teams before the autumn harvest, which went deep into all parts of the state, repairing wherever they went, and were deeply welcomed by farmers. In a short period of time, they completed the repair of more than 23,000 pieces of agricultural tools and transportation equipment, effectively supporting the autumn harvest.

At present, in order to ensure the timely supply of autumn agricultural tools, autumn agricultural tool supply networks and technical guidance networks have been established in various places, supplying while producing, so that autumn agricultural tools are continuously delivered to the front lines of autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting. In August alone, the province supplied more than 1.3 million pieces of various autumn tools. (Attached picture)

    革新农具提高农业劳动生产率
　　广西像抓插秧机一样普遍推广使用耘田器
　　辽宁铁岭县人民公社推广动力万能脱谷机
　　云南一手抓制造一手抓修配，三秋工具量多质好
    本报南宁21日电　广西各地积极推广使用耘田器。仅据柳州、玉林、南宁、梧州等四个专区的不完全统计，共修造耘田器一百四十多万把。有许多公社、生产大队实现了每个劳动力有一把。使用耘田器耘田，工效比脚耘提高一至两倍以上，并且耘的细致。
    今年，广西晚稻用插秧机插的相当多，机插田株行距整齐划一，为使用耘田器耘田创造了有利条件，因此，各地各级党委在集中劳力，加强田间管理的同时，把普遍推广使用耘田器，以提高耘田速度与质量，作为当前全党全民大办粮食的重要措施之一，并且提出要像抓插秧机那样，下狠劲抓耘田器。早在晚稻抢插接近结束时，南宁专区就派出工作组，到宁明、宾阳等县，收集群众对耘田器的意见，评选耘田器的型号，解决制造中的技术与原材料的问题，并且确定修造耘田器为当前工业部门支援农业的首要任务。柳州专区县、社分工，县工厂生产铁件，公社生产木件，采取厂社挂钩办法，在短短的时间内，就修造了大批耘田器，及时保证田间的需要。
    和推广插秧机一样，各级党委领导干部，成为推广使用耘田器的带头人。横县县委第一书记覃翯庭、县委书记苏雁、县委农村部长刘洪标，8月22日带领十二个耘田手，在曹村公社新桥垌首先使用耘田器耘田。路过这里的老汉莫继茂，看到他们转眼就耘了一大片，既轻松又快当，连连叫好。他还向覃书记要了一把，带回去作样子仿造。县委书记带头使用耘田器的消息，一阵风似的传遍全曹村公社，整个公社都动了起来。公社党委立即召开一个
  “百人表演实习会”，同时集中了二百五十六个木工加紧制造。
    广西各地在推广使用耘田器时特别注意了因地制宜，以充分发挥这种新式农具的效能。环江县采取书记、干部、技术员、老农四结合的办法，边实地操作，边研究各种耘田器的性能和各类土质，找到了看田使用耘田器的办法。
    本报沈阳21日电　为了把秋收工作做得又快、又全、又净、又好，沈阳市铁岭县各人民公社大力制造和推广地运所人民公社社员李圣洙创造的动力万能脱谷机，力争实现秋收脱谷机械化，全面提高打场脱谷效率。
    沈阳市铁岭县是辽宁省主要产粮地区之一，盛产苞米、高粱、水稻、大豆、小麦等粮谷作物。过去，除水稻脱谷是用脚踏脱谷机外，一般粮谷作物脱谷都是靠手工操作，效率很低，历年打场日期都需拖长两个月左右的时间，不仅加深了劳畜力不足的矛盾，也影响了秋耕、秋种和粮食及时入仓。今年全县秋收脱谷作物共有八万四千多垧，如果还用手工操作方法，需要七十五万多个人工和二十五万二千多个畜工，即使集中全力进行脱谷工作，仍需二十五到三十天才能脱完。因此，解决秋收脱谷机械化问题，是全面完成“三秋”生产任务的重要关键。
    这台动力万能脱谷机，是地运所人民公社社员李圣洙在中共铁岭县委领导下，经过多次试验制成的。这台动力万能脱谷机，由机架、输送带、脱粒磙、风扇、除杂筛、行走轮等六部分组成，从脱粒到扬场，全部是机械化，工作效率很高。用十五到二十五马力的电动机或柴油机带动，用二十个人操作，每十小时可脱谷十万多斤，等于二百人操纵二十九台脚踏打稻机干一天的工作量。这台机器是一种综合性的脱谷机械，它备有三套筛子，一套是打豆子和苞米用的，一套是打小麦、水稻和高粱用的，一套是打谷子、稗子、糜子用的，只要更换不同的筛子，就可以用它做各种粮谷作物的脱谷工作，代替了多种脱谷工具，全面提高了脱谷工作效率。这台脱谷机还具有打的净、扬的净的特点。据实际试验，它比脚踏打稻机和用磙压打场方法脱谷，每垧地可少损失百余斤粮食。此外，这台脱谷机还有构造简单、制造容易、成本低、移动方便等特点。机器全身除轴杠、传动轮、行走轮等是铁件外，大部分是木制件，只需木材一点九立米（成材），一般县、社农具厂都能制造，也可以采取县社农具厂制造铁件、各生产队木匠制造木件，然后统一装配，全部造价只一千二百多元。机身下边安有行走轮，移动十分方便，在一个场院完成脱谷任务后，就可以用动力牵引移到另一个场院继续进行脱谷工作。
    正因为这台脱谷机具有上述特点，中共铁岭县委决定普遍推广。目前，各公社正在加快制造。
    本报昆明21日电　云南省一手抓制造、一手抓修配，积极准备三秋农具。目前全省已生产打谷机、玉米脱粒机二万六千二百多部，深耕犁、播种机、收割机二十六万三千多件、部，各种小农具一千六百多万件。
    早在6月中旬，中共云南省委便召开了全省农业工作会议，对今年三秋农具的生产和供应进行了安排。各地根据省委的安排，在积极生产机械化、半机械化农具的同时，特别注意了小农具的生产，以便全面满足三秋生产的需要。全省九十多个县和一千三百多个人民公社的农具厂都投入了这一战斗。元江县各农具厂职工除了赶制打谷机、深耕犁等大农具外，还为全县每个劳动力准备了五件小农具（锄头、镰刀、蓑衣、雨帽、砍刀）。禄丰县各农具厂职工开展了劳动竞赛，打谷机日产量比原来提高了三倍多，全县三秋新农具生产任务已基本完成，破旧的农具也已全部修补起来。
    云南省三秋农具准备工作另一特点是普遍提高了农具产品质量。楚雄彝族自治州各县农具厂主动担负技术较高的打谷机、脱粒机等生产，把一般的小农具让给公社农具厂生产。这样，农具就造的又多又好。罗平县农具厂主动派出技术人员和老工人，带着新制成的打谷机先到田间作试验，征求打谷机手意见，然后回到厂里改进，最后经过工人、农民、技术员共同鉴定合格才成批生产，从而做到制造一件合格一件，出厂一件保用一件，使工人、农民双满意。?江县农机厂进行了技术革新以后，使打谷机产量提高了一倍，打谷机的转速由每分钟二百多转提高到四百多转。主要产品成本也降低了一半。
    在狠抓制造的同时，各地还抽调了大批技术力量组成修理队伍，深入到各管理区和生产队修补旧农具。已经开始秋收的红河哈尼族彝族自治州在秋收前组织了一千七百多人的修理队伍，分别深入到全州各地，走一处修一处，深受农民欢迎，很短时间就完成了二万三千多件农具和运输工具的修理工作，有力地支援了秋收。
    目前，为了保证三秋农具的及时供应，各地普遍建立了三秋农具供应网和技术指导网，边生产边供应，使三秋农具源源送到秋收、秋耕、秋种前线。全省仅在8月份就供应了各种三秋工具一百三十多万件。（附图片）
