　　Trần Duy Hưng, Chairman of the Hanoi Municipal Administrative Committee, delivered a speech at the rally, saying that in the just struggle against the imperialist conspiracies headed by U.S. imperialism and for independence, democracy, and peace, the people of Vietnam and Guinea are staunch comrades-in-arms and friends who are forever closely united.

　　In conclusion, Trần Duy Hưng presented a silk banner to President Sékou Touré on behalf of the people of Hanoi. The banner read: "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Vietnamese and Guinean people!"

　　He said that for the African people, the name of Chairman Ho Chi Minh is a symbol of courageous national liberation struggle. Therefore, many people in Guinea have named their children after Ho Chi Minh. He said that the child of our delegation's Speaker of the National Assembly, Diallo Saifoulaye, is also named this way. He said, I believe that the fraternal friendship that connects our two countries will grow stronger day by day.

    胡志明主席和杜尔总统签署联合公报
    据新华社河内17日电　据越南通讯社报道，河内各界人民十万人今天早晨在巴亭广场举行盛大集会，隆重、热烈地欢迎塞古·杜尔总统和他率领的几内亚共和国代表团。
    上午六时十五分，当杜尔总统在胡志明主席陪同下登上主席台时，聚集在广场上的群众挥舞着几内亚和越南民主共和国两国国旗和鲜花，不停地欢呼，整个会场顿时沸腾起来。
    登上主席台的还有越南党和国家领导人孙德胜、黎笋、长征、范文同等。各国驻河内的外交使节也出席了大会。
    河内市行政委员会主席陈维兴在大会上致词，他说，在反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阴谋活动、争取独立、民主和和平的正义斗争中，越南和几内亚两国人民是坚强的战友，是永远密切地团结在一起的朋友。
    陈维兴最后代表河内人民把一面锦旗赠给塞古·杜尔总统。旗上写着：“越南和几内亚人民之间的牢不可破的友谊万岁！”
    塞古·杜尔总统在热烈的掌声中发表讲话。他首先向越南劳动党和越南总工会致敬。他说，我们代表团同你们伟大的党、你们的总工会接触，目的在于进一步加强我们两国之间的合作，还为了感谢越南人民为法国殖民地的解放运动所作出的贡献，特别是为了向英明的、勇敢的、朴素的胡志明主席致敬。
    他说，对非洲人民来说，胡志明主席的名字是勇敢的、民族解放斗争的象征。因此，几内亚许多人曾经用胡志明三个字给自己的孩子起名。他说，我们代表团的迪阿洛·塞福拉耶议长的孩子也起了这个名字。他说，我相信，把我们两国连接在一起的兄弟般的友谊将会日益发展。
    胡主席接着向群众和青年们发表讲话。他说，塞古·杜尔伯伯刚才谈到越南和几内亚两国人民的友谊。你们看，你们不但有胡志明伯伯，而且，在几内亚，你们还有许多胡志明哥哥、胡志明姊姊。他向塞古·杜尔总统提议说：请允许我把越南的好孩子起塞古·杜尔的名字。
    大会结束时，胡志明主席亲自领着大家唱歌曲“团结就是力量”。会场上充满了热烈和友好的气氛。
    据新华社河内16日电　越南劳动党中央委员会、越南民主共和国政府、国会、祖国战线今晚在主席府联合举行盛大宴会，招待塞古·杜尔总统和他率领的几内亚共和国政府代表团。
    越南方面出席这次宴会的，有胡志明主席，孙德胜副主席，国会常务委员会主席长征，越南劳动党中央委员会第一书记黎笋，总理范文同，副总理范雄、武元甲、阮维祯、潘继遂，最高人民检察院院长黄国越，政府各部部长，越南亚非人民团结委员会副主席阮春水，以及各政党和各人民团体的代表等。
    出席宴会的还有各国驻越南使节。
    范文同总理在宴会上致词时盛赞几内亚人民所取得的胜利和他们对亚非各民族反对殖民主义的斗争和保卫和平事业所作的贡献。
    塞古·杜尔总统也在宴会上讲了话。他说，我们清楚地看到帝国主义给各民族带来的后果，所以我们和你们坚决重新建设我们的生活，建设完全民主的制度。
    塞古·杜尔总统强调指出，殖民主义还没有死，帝国主义还活着。假如说，用军事力量进行残酷的殖民是帝国主义的一个方面的话，那么，今天，殖民主义和帝国主义在经济、文化、政治的形式下继续它们的活动，来离间每个民族，来搜括黄金、金刚石和银子，即令全人类被消灭了也在所不惜。
    新华社河内17日电　此间今天宣布，越南民主共和国主席胡志明和几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔今晚在这里签署了联合公报。
