Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 21st – The Cuban newspaper "Hoy" today published a joint statement signed by representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of fifteen Latin American countries participating in the Eighth National Congress of the Cuban Popular Socialist Party, supporting the Cuban Revolution.

The statement strongly condemned the "Declaration of San José" forced through the San José Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American States by U.S. imperialism. The statement pointed out that U.S. imperialism, using intimidation, suppression, and bribery at the Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American States, colluded with some Latin American countries to pass this declaration, which is a criminal act against Cuba and against Latin America. The statement said that the San José meeting "once again clearly proves that the Organization of American States is now and always has been nothing more than a colonial department of the United States."

The statement said, "Cuba today embodies the patriotic and democratic aspirations of our peoples. The wealth of our countries is being plundered by U.S. imperialism and its partners, the large landowners and anti-national big capitalists, and national sovereignty is undermined by accepting the instructions of others in foreign policy." The statement pointed out that the Cuban people's struggle to regain their complete national sovereignty and against U.S. imperialism creates favorable conditions for the independence of every country in Latin America. The statement emphasized, "Cuba today proves once again that imperialism can no longer prevent the liberation of countries that are firmly determined to break free from foreign enslavement and gain freedom, determined to develop and diversify their economies, and determined to break free from the control of monopoly organizations in order to conduct equal trade."

The statement said, "However, it would be a serious mistake to underestimate the dangers of the Organization of American States meeting that threaten all our peoples. The declaration passed by the Organization of American States should be exposed. This declaration is a deceptive mandate given to U.S. imperialism for aggression against Cuba, an attempt to cover up the Cold War and anti-Soviet conspiracies, a tool to attack the national liberation movements of our peoples, and a conspiracy against the democratic freedom of every country and against the rights of the working people and the masses."

The statement pointed out that support for the Cuban Revolution is now more urgent than ever. "Interventionist actions by U.S. imperialism, conspiracies by the State Department, and aggression preparations by the Pentagon are continuing shamelessly and frantically." The statement exposed U.S. imperialism's preparations for armed intervention against Cuba. It said, "If the invasion of Cuba has not yet occurred, it is due to the determination of the Cuban government, the unity of the Cuban people and revolutionary forces, and their high level of vigilance." The statement particularly pointed out the importance of the support of the Latin American and world people for Cuba, especially the support and assistance of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The statement said that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has once again proved that it "is the most resolute supporter of all peoples who hope to strive for national independence and continuously develop their own economies."

The statement emphasized, "Defending the Cuban Revolution and more broadly and deeply developing the struggle of our peoples to support the popular, anti-imperialist, and anti-feudal government headed by Dr. Fidel Castro and all Cuban revolutionary forces is the unshirkable responsibility of the patriots and all democratic strata of our continent." The statement said that the representatives of the fifteen fraternal parties of Latin America "guarantee to work harder to promote this support in cooperation with all workers, students, peasants, and the popular, patriotic, democratic, and progressive forces of our continent."

The statement was signed by the Communist and Workers' Parties of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Uruguay, Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Brazil.

    拉丁美洲十五国共产党和工人党代表联合声明
　　支援古巴是拉丁美洲人民的责任
　　揭露美帝国主义正在疯狂准备武装干涉活动
    新华社哈瓦那21日电　古巴  “今日报”今天登载了参加古巴人民社会党第八次全国代表大会的拉丁美洲十五国共产党和工人党的代表签署的一项支持古巴革命的联合声明。
    声明强烈谴责美帝国主义强使圣约瑟美洲国家外长会议通过的所谓“圣约瑟宣言”。声明指出，美帝国主义在美洲国家外长会议上使用恫吓、压制和收买手段，串通一些拉丁美洲国家通过这项宣言，是一桩反对古巴和反对拉丁美洲的罪恶勾当。声明说，圣约瑟会议“再一次清楚地证明，美洲国家组织现在和过去都只不过是美国的殖民部而已。”
    声明说，“古巴今天体现了我们各国人民的爱国和民主的愿望。我们各国人民的财富正在遭到美帝国主义以及它的伙伴大庄园主和反民族的大资本家的掠夺，国家的主权由于在对外政策方面接受别人的指令而受到损害。”声明指出，古巴人民争取收回自己完整的国家主权和反对美帝国主义的斗争为拉丁美洲每个国家的独立创造了良好的条件。声明强调指出，“古巴今天又一次证明，帝国主义已经不能阻止这样一些国家的解放，这些国家坚定不移地决心要摆脱外国的奴役并获得自由，决心要发展自己的经济并使其多样化，决心摆脱垄断组织的控制以便进行平等的贸易。”
    声明说，“但是，如果低估威胁着我们所有各国人民的美洲国家组织会议的危险，将是严重的错误。应该揭露美洲国家组织通过的宣言，这项宣言是为了侵略古巴而给予美帝国主义的欺骗性的委任书，是企图掩饰冷战和反苏的阴谋，是用来攻击我们各国人民民族解放运动的工具，是反对每个国家的民主自由以及反对劳动人民和人民群众的权利的阴谋。”
    声明指出，对古巴革命的支援现在比任何时候都更加迫不及待了，“美帝国主义的干涉行动、国务院的阴谋和五角大楼的侵略准备正在无耻和疯狂地继续进行。”声明揭露美帝国主义正在准备对古巴采取武装干涉行动。它说，“如果说对古巴的入侵还没有发生，这是由于古巴政府的坚决、古巴人民和革命力量的团结一致和保持着高度的警惕。”声明特别指出拉丁美洲和世界人民对古巴的支援，尤其是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的支援和帮助的重要意义。声明说，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营再次证明，它“是一切希望争取民族独立、不断发展本身经济的人民的最坚决的支持者。”
    声明强调指出，“保卫古巴革命和更加广泛深入地开展我们各国人民支援以菲德尔·卡斯特罗博士为首的、人民的、反帝和反封建的政府以及古巴一切革命力量的斗争，是我们大陆的爱国者和一切民主阶层的无可推卸的责任。”声明说，拉丁美洲十五个兄弟党的代表们“保证更加努力奋斗，在我们大陆一切工人、学生、农民以及人民的、爱国的、民主的和进步的力量合作下推进这种支援。”
    签署这项声明的是阿根廷、玻利维亚、智利、哥伦比亚、哥斯达黎加、委内瑞拉、危地马拉、尼加拉瓜、巴拿马、乌拉圭、秘鲁、厄瓜多尔、墨西哥、波多黎各和巴西的共产党和工人党。
