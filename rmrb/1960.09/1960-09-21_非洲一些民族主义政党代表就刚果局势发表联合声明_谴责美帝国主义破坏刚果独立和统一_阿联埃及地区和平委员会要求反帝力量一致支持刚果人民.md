Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 19th: Representatives of some African nationalist parties stationed in Cairo issued a joint statement at a press conference held here tonight on the situation in the Congo, strongly condemning imperialist countries, especially the United States, for colluding with and supporting Congolese reactionaries and separatists in an attempt to undermine the independence, unity, and sovereignty of the Congo.

    The statement affirms the independence and sovereignty of the Republic of the Congo and its inherent right to negotiate in any form within and outside the United Nations. Therefore, the statement condemns the U.S.-orchestrated conspiracy of so-called assistance to the Congo only through the United Nations, believing that this is a blatant violation of Congolese sovereignty. Given that the United Nations Secretariat has become a tool of imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, the statement demands that Hammarskjöld immediately resign from his post as Secretary-General of the United Nations and calls for a fundamental reorganization of the United Nations Secretariat.

    The joint statement was issued by representatives of nationalist parties from Cameroon, Kenya, Northern Rhodesia, Ruanda-Urundi, South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, Uganda, and Zanzibar.

    The statement condemns the United Nations for actively engaging in conspiracies against the legitimate government of Lumumba, and condemns Belgian imperialists for fostering certain separatists in the Congo with the help of the United Nations.

    The statement also expresses firm support for the government of the Republic of the Congo led by Prime Minister Lumumba.

      The statement calls on independent African countries and all countries opposed to imperialism and colonialism to take firm and unified action to support the government of the Republic of the Congo headed by Prime Minister Lumumba.

    Finally, these African nationalists pledged in the statement to continue to fight for the complete liberation of Africa from colonialism and imperialist rule.

    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 19th: The Afro-Asian Egyptian Regional Peace Committee issued a statement here on the 18th, saying that the "chaotic situation in the Congo is the result of interference by imperialist countries under the banner of the United Nations." It calls on all anti-imperialist forces in the world to unite in the struggle against imperialist conspiracies in the Congo.

    The statement said that the latest imperialist conspiracy is the armed coup carried out by Mobutu, the purpose of which is to attempt to restore imperialist rule over the Congo and undermine the sovereignty of the Congolese people.

    The statement condemns the United Nations for condoning reactionary forces, enabling Belgium to provide weapons to traitors, and condemns the United Nations for occupying Leopoldville airport and radio station.

    Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, September 20th: Newspapers here reported today that the Burma National United Front issued a statement strongly condemning the United Nations for interfering in the internal affairs of the Congo and undermining the Congo's sovereignty and independence, and called on peace-loving people around the world to stop the U.S. imperialist attempt to swallow the Congo.

    The statement firmly supports the unity of the Congo and opposes the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to sow discord among the Congolese people. The statement calls for the defense of the sovereignty and independence of the Republic of the Congo.

    The statement demands that the United Nations Security Council immediately withdraw "United Nations forces" from the Congo and that Belgian troops not be allowed to remain on Congolese territory under any circumstances.
