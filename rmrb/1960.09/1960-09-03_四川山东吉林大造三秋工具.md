    Sichuan, Shandong, and Jilin Vigorously Manufacture Tools for the Three Autumns
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Sichuan is preparing early for the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting) through reforming and manufacturing various tools, powerfully supporting agricultural production.

    Currently, the intense "Four Autumns" (autumn harvest, autumn plowing, autumn planting, and autumn storage) work in Sichuan Province has already begun. Because the task this year is large and the requirements are high, in addition to organizing and supplying more than 90 million commonly used small farm tools in a timely manner, various regions have also reviewed and appraised, selected samples and finalized designs, and summarized more than 500 excellent advanced tools, drawing up blueprints for each, classifying them into complete sets, and promoting them universally throughout the province. In just two months, the province has manufactured and supplied more than 4 million pieces of improved and semi-mechanized tools and implements urgently needed for production. More than 80% of these are produced and sold locally, ensuring timely supply, low prices, and suitability for production.

    In the overall arrangement of agricultural tool production, various regions, in accordance with the policy of "taking grain as the key link and promoting all-round development," have placed the production of various agricultural tools urgently needed for large-scale grain production in the primary position, uniformly arranging plans, uniformly allocating raw materials, uniformly using technical forces, and uniformly utilizing production equipment for production. At present, more than 2,190,000 new-style plows and harrows have been transported to the countryside, and more than 1,100,000 pieces of improved and semi-mechanized machines and tools urgently needed for autumn field management and harvesting, threshing, and grain beating have also been put into use in various communes.

    Jinan, September 2nd, Our Newspaper Dispatch: Shandong Province, under the slogan of "Early preparation, timely delivery of tools," has launched a mass movement to vigorously reform tools for the "Three Autumns".

    This year, Shandong Province has a larger autumn crop area than in any previous year, and the autumn sowing area will also increase compared to last year, due to the thorough implementation of the policy of multiple planting for greater yields and high yields for greater harvests. In order to conscientiously implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and vigorously grasping grain production, as early as June after the summer harvest, various regions generally conducted a thorough review and assessment of "Three Autumns" tools, formulated plans, selected samples, finalized designs, and trial-manufactured samples based on the heavy "Three Autumns" production situation this year. Subsequently, they invested in the remanufacturing of "Three Autumns" tools. Party secretaries at all levels in the province took the lead in the reform of "Three Autumns" tools at every level, going deep into the front line of production to grasp planning and measures. Many areas have also established command headquarters or leading groups for the reform of "Three Autumns" tools. Therefore, a mass movement to vigorously reform "Three Autumns" tools has been formed in various regions. For example, twenty-eight machinery factories in Yantai Prefecture are going all out to rush-manufacture "Three Autumns" tools. All 181 people's communes, commune-owned repair and assembly plants, and team-owned repair stations in this prefecture have been put into the repair and manufacture of "Three Autumns" tools.

    This year's "Three Autumns" tool reform movement in Shandong Province also unified the manufacturing specifications of new-style tools according to local conditions, and vigorously grasped the repair and manufacture of deep plowing and close planting machinery and tools to meet the requirements of deep plowing and close planting, so as to combine it with the reform of the cultivation system and achieve a complete set of plowing, harrowing, leveling, and sowing.

    While vigorously reforming "Three Autumns" tools, Shandong Province is also vigorously developing water lifting tools to prepare for drought-resistant sowing.

    Changchun, September 2nd, Our Newspaper Dispatch: Workers on the industrial front in Jilin Province are vigorously rushing to manufacture autumn harvesting and autumn plowing machinery. The province has already manufactured more than 11,000 pieces of harvesting, threshing, and deep plowing machinery and transported them to the countryside, an increase of nearly nine times compared to the same period last year. At the same time, various people's communes in rural areas have also produced a large number of small "Three Autumns" farm tools.

    This year, Jilin Province started manufacturing autumn harvesting and autumn plowing machinery earlier than in previous years. Various regions began preparing as early as the end of the second quarter, and mass production began at the beginning of the third quarter, one and a half months earlier than last year. Especially since the whole Party and the whole people have been engaged in large-scale agriculture and large-scale grain production, all walks of life have become more active in serving agriculture, supporting the production of agricultural machinery with manpower, materials, and technology.

    In order to complete the manufacturing tasks on schedule and with guaranteed quality and quantity, the agricultural machinery industry department has listed the manufacturing of these machines as the primary task of current industrial production. Several directors of the Provincial Agricultural Machinery Department have led cadres from the entire department to various prefectures since the third quarter to specifically inspect the machinery manufacturing situation and help solve many specific problems. Factories are determined to complete production tasks ahead of schedule in the spirit of concentrating forces and ensuring key products.

### 四川山东吉林大造三秋工具

    四川山东吉林大造三秋工具
    据新华社讯　四川各地及早为收、耕、种、运改革、制造各种工具，有力地支援了农业生产。
    目前，四川省紧张的四秋（秋收、秋耕、秋种、秋藏）工作已经开始。由于今年任务大，要求高，各地除及时组织供应九千多万件常年使用的小农具外，还通过审查鉴定、选样定型，总结出五百多件优良的先进工具，分别绘制图纸，分类配套成龙，在全省普遍推广。全省在短短两个月中，就制造供应了生产急需的改良和半机械化工具和农具四百多万件。其中80％以上都是就地产就地销，做到供应及时，价格低廉，生产适用。
    在全面安排农具生产中，各地根据“以粮为纲、全面发展”的方针，把当前大办粮食急需的各种农具放在首要地位，统一安排规划，统一调配原料，统一使用技术力量和统一利用生产设备进行生产。现在全省已有二百一十九万多部新式犁、耙运向农村，秋季田间管理和收割、脱粒、打谷等急需的一百一十多万件改良和半机械化机具，也已在各公社发挥了作用。
    本报济南2日电　山东省各地在一早百早，季节不到工具到的口号下，掀起大搞三秋工具改革的群众运动。
    今年，山东省由于全面贯彻了多种多收和高产多收方针，秋季作物面积比以往任何一年都多，秋播面积也将比去年增加。为了切实贯彻以农业为基础的方针，大抓粮食生产，早在今年6月夏收结束后，各地就根据今年三秋生产繁重的情况，普遍对三秋工具进行了摸底排队，制订规划，选样定型和试制样品，接着便投入了三秋工具的改制。全省各级党委书记在三秋工具的改革工作中层层挂帅，深入生产第一线，抓规划、抓措施。不少地区还成立了三秋工具改革指挥部或领导小组。因此一个大搞三秋工具改革的群众运动已在各地形成。如烟台专区二十八个机械厂全力以赴赶制三秋工具。这个专区一百八十一个人民公社，社有修配厂和队有修配站，全部投入了三秋工具的修理制造。
    今年山东省三秋工具改革运动，还因地制宜统一了新式工具的制造规格以及为了适应深耕密植要求大抓深耕和密植播种机具的修理制造，以便与耕作制度的改革结合起来，做到耕、耙、整、播配套成龙。
    山东省在大搞三秋工具改革的同时，还大搞提水工具，为抗旱播种做好准备。
    本报长春2日电　吉林省工业战线职工大力赶制秋收、秋耕机具。全省已制出收割、脱粒和深耕机具一万一千多件运往农村，比去年同期增加近九倍。同时，农村各人民公社还生产了大批“三秋”小农具。
    今年吉林省制造秋收、秋耕机具比历年动手都早，各地从第二季度末就着手进行准备，三季度初大量开始生产，较去年提前一个半月。尤其是全党全民大办农业、大办粮食以来，各行各业更加积极地为农业服务，以人力、材料、技术等方面支援农机具生产。
    为了按期和保质、保量地完成制造任务，农业机械工业部门把这些机具制造，列为当前工业生产的首要任务。省农业机械厅几名厅长从三季度起就带领全厅干部，分赴各专区具体检查机具制造情况，并帮助解决许多具体问题。各工厂本着集中力量，保证重点产品的精神，决心提前完成生产任务。
