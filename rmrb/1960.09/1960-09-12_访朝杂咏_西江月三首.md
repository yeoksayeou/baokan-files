    Miscellaneous Poems on a Visit to North Korea
    —Three Songs of "West River Moon"	Zhao Yang
        The Sino-Korean Friendship Tower
    Anti-American Aid Korea's brave men, defending the country's heroes. Three years of fighting established miraculous achievements, breaking the enemy's delusions. Further participating in construction, the military and civilians are as inseparable as fish and water. The high tower stands tall on Moranbong, with peace and security shared for generations.
        Visiting Kaesong
    Five hundred years of ancient relics, a famous city on the 38th parallel. Laughing and talking about the American imperialists raising the white flag, coming here to negotiate their ugly state. Grand gathering in front of Namdaemun, deep Sino-Korean fraternal feelings. Three thousand sons and daughters release joyous sounds, celebrating the prosperity of both countries.
        Visiting Panmunjom
    Two years of negotiations for the armistice, shoulder to shoulder defending peace. Three changes of American chieftains exhausting their troops, forced to sign the agreement. One line separates north and south, two completely different scenes. The south is a storm, the north is sunny, the reunification of the motherland is near.

    访朝杂咏
    ——西江月三首	赵扬
        朝中友谊塔
    抗美援朝好汉，保家卫国英雄。三年奋战建奇功，打破敌人迷梦。更复参加建设，军民水乳相溶。高塔屹立牡丹峰，世世安危与共。
        访开城
    五百年前古迹，三八线上名城。笑谈美帝白旗升，来此谈判丑景。南大门前盛会，中朝手足情深。三千儿女放欢声，共庆两国昌盛。
        访板门店
    两载谈判停战，比肩捍卫和平。三易美酋折尽兵，被迫签订协定。一线分开南北，截然两种情景。南边风暴北边晴，祖国统一期近。
