    Everyone is Responsible for Vigorously Developing Agriculture
    Striving to Return to the Forefront
    After the People's Daily published the editorial "The Whole Party Mobilizes, the Entire People Mobilizes, Vigorously Develop Agriculture, Vigorously Develop Grain Production," all departments and production teams in the Xicheng Commune of Keshan County, Heilongjiang, conducted study and discussions. Commune cadres, employees of commune-run factories, and members of various service industries, through study and discussions, recognized the importance of participating in agricultural labor and wrote applications or big-character posters, requesting the commune Party committee to approve their return to the agricultural forefront. Ma Yaowen, a clerk at the commune's supply and marketing cooperative, said: "I request the Party committee to approve my return to the agricultural production front, and to strive for a good autumn harvest together with the veteran commune members." Sun Lihua, a female commune member who had just become a waitress at the commune restaurant, applied to the commune Party committee, saying: "Agricultural production is so important, and agricultural work is so busy now, please approve my return to the production team to work quickly."
    Based on the requests of the commune members, the commune Party committee made a unified plan and comprehensive arrangement for the labor force of the entire commune, and decided to suspend some departments that were not closely related to current agricultural production. The transportation team, which specialized in sideline occupations, returned both people and horse-drawn carts to their original production teams to participate in production, and the amateur cultural troupe temporarily suspended performances. In this way, a total of 1,007 people in the entire commune returned to the agricultural production front. On August 29, more than 7,000 people in the entire commune went to the fields to work, and harvested more than 1,400 mu of spring wheat in half a day; the number of people participating in autumn field management increased by 700 compared to before.

    大办农业人人有责
    争先回到第一线
    人民日报发表“全党动手、全民动手，大办农业、大办粮食”的社论以后，黑龙江克山县西城公社的各个部门和生产队都进行了学习和讨论。公社干部、社办工厂职工和各个服务性行业的社员，通过学习讨论，认识到参加农业劳动的重要，纷纷写申请书或大字报，要求公社党委批准他们到农业第一线去。公社供销部的店员马耀文说：“我请求党委批准我回到农业生产战线上去，和老社员一起争取秋季丰收。”刚到公社饭店当服务员的女社员孙丽华，向公社党委申请说：“农业生产这么重要，现在农活又忙，赶快批准我回到生产队干活吧。”
    公社党委根据社员的请求，对全公社的劳动力做了统一规划和全面安排，决定停办一些与当前农业生产关系不大的部门。专门搞副业的运输队，人和马车都回到原来的生产队参加生产，业余文工团暂时停止演出，这样全公社共有一千零七人回到了农业生产战线。8月29日，全公社有七千多人下地生产，半天时间收回春麦一千四百多亩；参加秋田管理的人数比以前增加了七百人。　康风森
