Vigorously Plant Green Manure
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    To vigorously plant green manure crops is an effective way to develop fertilizer production with greater, faster, better and more economical results. Now is the season for autumn planting of green manure in the south. If we plant enough and plant well this autumn, we will have sufficient base fertilizer for the early rice crop next year.

    Green manure is a high-quality, high-yielding organic fertilizer. One mu of green manure can generally yield four to five thousand catties, and high-yielding crops can yield about ten thousand catties. Green manure contains various nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. One catty of green manure has the same fertilizer effect as one catty of pig manure. Leguminous green manure crops such as milk vetch and vetch not only convert ineffective or slow-release substances such as phosphorus and potassium in the soil into useful and fast-acting fertilizers, but also fix nitrogen from the air through the activity of rhizobia, turning it into fertilizers that crops can absorb and utilize. Calculated on the basis of a yield of 4,000 catties of leguminous green manure per mu, the nitrogen produced by using air alone is ten to thirteen catties, equivalent to fifty to sixty catties of ammonium sulfate. According to experiments and investigations in some areas, applying 2,000 catties of green manure per mu, in conjunction with other effective measures, can increase rice production by 100 to 150 catties; applying 4,000 catties of green manure per mu can increase rice production by 200 to 300 catties. Green manure also contains rich organic matter, which has a particularly significant effect on improving the soil, especially on transforming low-yielding fields. Green manure crops are also good feed and honey plants. Growing more green manure is not only conducive to increasing grain production and improving the soil, but also promotes the development of animal husbandry.

    Planting green manure saves labor and also saves the labor of transporting fertilizer. This is another major advantage of green manure. Last year, Maoshi People's Commune in Jianli County, Hubei Province, vigorously planted aquatic green manure, which not only greatly increased the amount of fertilizer applied, but also saved more than 200,000 workdays in fertilizer accumulation. Green manure can be plowed under on the spot or applied nearby, which can save a lot of fertilizer transportation labor and solve the fertilizer problem of distant fields most effectively.

    Since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, China's green manure production has developed rapidly. The area of green manure harvested in the spring of 1960 increased by more than one time compared with 1952, and the yield per unit area increased by more than two times compared with 1952. However, in order to meet the needs of a substantial increase in agricultural production, we must plant more green manure while vigorously developing pig raising and manure accumulation, accumulating native miscellaneous fertilizers, and manufacturing chemical fertilizers. This is not only an important measure to solve the current fertilizer problem, but also an important aspect of completely solving China's fertilizer problem. Therefore, both the southern and northern regions should develop green manure production according to local conditions.

    China has a vast territory, not only with large areas of barren mountains, water surfaces, and forest land, but also with a large amount of fallow land every year, which can be used to plant green manure crops. According to incomplete statistics, there are 470 million mu of idle fields, gaps, and water surfaces in the fourteen provinces and regions of the South, of which more than 170 million mu are winter fallow fields, all of which can be planted with green manure crops. Areas with more cultivated land can certainly be planted, and areas with less cultivated land can also be planted. Pingxiang County in Jiangxi Province has an average of only six fen of land per person, but the green manure planting area has still developed from 110,000 mu before liberation to the current 360,000 mu. Due to the annual expansion of the green manure area and the substantial increase in fertilizer, coupled with other production increase measures, this county has changed from a grain-deficient county to a surplus grain county. In addition to single planting, green manure can also be planted intercropping and interplanting to expand the planting area. Qidong County, Jiangsu Province, is an area with little land and a large population, and the multiple cropping index is already high. In recent years, they have adopted methods such as intercropping broad beans and yellow flower grass, intercropping wheat and broad beans (for green manure), intercropping rape and yellow flower grass, and intercropping potatoes and yellow flower grass, intercropping green manure on 360,000 mu, accounting for 31% of the total cultivated land area. Vigorously promoting intercropping and interplanting of green manure is the main direction for developing green manure crops in the future.

    The season for autumn planting of green manure in the southern region has arrived. All localities should seize the opportunity, rationally arrange labor, and plant more and better crops.

    大种绿肥作物，是多快好省地发展肥料生产的一个有效办法。目前正是南方秋种绿肥的季节，今年种足、种好秋季绿肥，明年早稻的基肥就充裕了。
    绿肥是一种优质、高产的有机肥料。一亩绿肥一般能收四、五千斤，高产的能收万斤左右。绿肥含有氮、磷、钾等各种养分，一斤绿肥的肥效相当一斤猪粪。紫云英、苕子等豆科绿肥作物，不仅能把土壤中的磷、钾等无效的或迟效的物质转化为有用的和速效的肥料，而且能通过根瘤菌的活动，把空气中的氮素固定起来，变成作物能吸收利用的肥料。按亩产豆科绿肥四千斤计算，光是利用空气制造的氮素就有十斤到十三斤，相当五、六十斤硫酸铵。根据一些地区试验和调查，每亩施绿肥二千斤，在其他有效措施配合下，可增产稻谷一百斤到一百五十斤；每亩施绿肥四千斤，可增产稻谷二百斤到三百斤。绿肥还含有丰富的有机质，对于改良土壤，特别是改造低产田，有特别显著的功效。绿肥作物还是很好的饲料和蜜源植物，多种绿肥既有利于增产粮食和改良土壤，又能促进牧畜业的发展。
    种绿肥既省工，又能节省运肥劳力，这是它的又一大优点。湖北监利县毛市人民公社去年大种水生绿肥，不仅大大增加了施肥量，还节省了积肥用工二十多万个。绿肥可以就地翻压或就近施用，既能节省大量的运肥劳力，又能最有效地解决远田的肥料问题。
    解放以来，特别是大跃进以来，我国的绿肥生产发展很快。1960年春收绿肥面积比1952年增加一倍多，单位面积产量比1952年提高两倍以上。但是，为了适应农业大幅度增产的需要，我们必须在大搞养猪积肥、大积土杂肥和大造化肥的同时，更多地种植绿肥，这不仅是解决当前肥料问题的重要措施，也是彻底解决我国肥料问题的一个重要方面。因此，无论是南方地区或是北方地区，都应当因地制宜，努力发展绿肥生产。
    我国地域辽阔，不仅有大片荒山、水面和林地，每年还有大量休闲田，都可用来种植绿肥作物。据不完全统计，南方十四个省、区的闲田、隙地和水面就有四亿七千万亩，其中冬闲田有一亿七千多万亩，都能种植绿肥作物。耕地多的地区固然可以种，耕地少的地区同样可以种。江西萍乡县平均每人只有六分地，绿肥种植面积仍然由解放前的十一万亩发展到目前的三十六万亩。由于绿肥面积年年扩大，肥料大大增加，加上其它增产措施，这个县已由缺粮县变成了余粮县。绿肥除了单种以外，还可以采取间种、套种的办法，扩大种植面积。江苏启东县是一个地少人多的地区，复种指数已经较高，近年来他们采取蚕豆和黄花草间作，麦子和蚕豆（当绿肥用）间作，油菜和黄花草间作，马铃薯和黄花草间作等办法，间作绿肥三十六万亩，占全部耕地面积31％。大力推广间种、套种绿肥，是今后发展绿肥作物的主要方向。
    南方地区秋种绿肥的季节已经到了，各地应该抓紧时机，合理安排劳力，多种种好。
