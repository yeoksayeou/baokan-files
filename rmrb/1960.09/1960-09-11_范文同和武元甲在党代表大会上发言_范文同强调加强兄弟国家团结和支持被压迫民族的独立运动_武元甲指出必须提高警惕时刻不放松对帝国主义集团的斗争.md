　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 9th: According to Vietnam News Agency, the Third National Congress of the Vietnam Workers' Party continued on the afternoon of September 9th. Pham Van Dong, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, delivered a speech on the issue of political power and foreign policy.

　　Vo Nguyen Giap, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Labor Party and Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, delivered a speech on the consolidation of national defense and the construction of the people's armed forces.

　　Pham Van Dong said in his speech: "The history of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam proves the correctness of Marx, Engels, and Lenin's theory of state power."

　　Pham Van Dong fully agreed with the Central Committee's basic view of the current international situation and the basic policies on the Party's foreign affairs put forward in the political report of President Ho Chi Minh and the Central Committee.

　　Pham Van Dong said: "Under the leadership of the Party, our people are determined to further enhance friendship, unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation with fraternal socialist countries, and strive to strengthen the socialist forces."

　　He said: "Our people are infinitely excited about the great victories achieved by the Soviet Union in the cause of building communism and the brilliant achievements in the field of science and technology. The October Revolution illuminated the revolutionary path for the working class and oppressed people all over the world; during World War II, the Soviet Union saved mankind from fascist rule and created conditions for the formation of the world socialist system; the Soviet Union has continuously provided selfless assistance to socialist fraternal countries in developing their economies, cultures, and building new lives; the Soviet Union is a firm and powerful supporter of oppressed nations in their struggle for liberation and consolidation of national independence; the Soviet Union is a heroic and resolute fighter against aggressive and bellicose imperialism, especially US imperialism, and in defense of world peace. The great Soviet Union can be called the head of the socialist camp."

　　He also said: "Our people are extremely pleased and inspired by the rapid growth of the People's Republic of China, a large country with 650 million people, which enjoys increasing trust and influence among all nations in the world, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Since its establishment, the People's Republic of China has made great contributions to strengthening the forces of socialism, promoting national liberation movements, firmly opposing US imperialism, and safeguarding peace. The more US imperialism antagonizes the People's Republic of China, the more firmly the fraternal countries of our socialist camp and the people of the world support the great Chinese people and firmly demand that the People's Republic of China obtain its due position in the world."

　　He also said: "We are infinitely excited about the brilliant victories achieved by other socialist fraternal countries. At present, many countries have completed socialist transformation, and some countries have completed or are completing socialist construction and preparing to move towards communism."

　　Pham Van Dong said, "The Vietnamese nation has had a long-standing relationship with many nations in Southeast Asia throughout history. The revolutionary process of our people is a process of struggle by an oppressed nation against imperialist aggression. Our current struggle to liberate the South is part of the world national independence movement. The sacred resistance war of the Vietnamese people is a contribution to the cause of liberating oppressed nations. The victories of the August Revolution and the Dien Bien Phu campaign are not only a great victory for our people but also a common victory for all nations struggling for freedom. The leader of our people, President Ho Chi Minh, is a fighter against imperialism and for national independence, and he is deeply loved and respected by the people of Asia and Africa."

　　He said: "In recent years, many African countries have achieved national independence. We excitedly and happily welcome these countries to join the ranks of independent countries in the world to continue the struggle against imperialism, especially US imperialism, in order to safeguard national independence and world peace. We believe that the friendly relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and these countries will be better developed. Our country has established formal diplomatic relations with the Republic of Guinea and sent an ambassador to the capital of Guinea. This event marks an important step forward in opening up and developing the road of friendly relations between our country and African countries. We are particularly concerned about the friendly relations between our country and neighboring states. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always hoped to establish friendly relations with the Kingdom of Cambodia, and the Kingdom of Laos based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and respect for the Geneva Accords. We are pleased to see the growing development of friendly relations between our country and the Kingdom of Cambodia. We welcome and support the policy of peace and neutrality adopted by the Kingdom of Cambodia under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk. We are ready to establish friendly relations with the Kingdom of Laos, as long as the government of the Kingdom of Laos conscientiously implements the policy of peace and neutrality, respects the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements. The patriotic movement of the Lao people against the interference of US imperialism is a new victory for the national liberation struggle that the Lao people are carrying out everywhere in the country, and it is also a miserable defeat for US imperialism."

　　He said: "We will never forget the sympathy and support of the oppressed nations for our past resistance war and our current struggle for the reunification of our motherland. The Vietnamese people have always firmly supported the just struggle of the nations of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against colonial oppression and against the aggressive conspiracies of imperialism. The Vietnamese people have recognized the Provisional Government of Algeria and thoroughly support the heroic struggle of the Algerian people. The Vietnamese people firmly support the struggle of the Congolese people against imperialism and its lackeys' aggression and conspiracies to split the territory of the Congo. In Latin America, the Cuban people, who are holding high the banner of national independence and resolutely fighting against US imperialism, have set a glorious example for the people of all countries in Latin America."

　　Pham Van Dong concluded: "We reiterate once again that we approve of and support the peace and peaceful coexistence policy of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, as well as the Soviet Union's proposals on complete and thorough disarmament, demanding the elimination of military bases in foreign countries, and demanding the prohibition of the testing, stockpiling, and use of various nuclear weapons. We approve of and support the People's Republic of China's proposal on signing a treaty of non-aggression in the Asian and Pacific regions and establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone."

　　In his speech, Vo Nguyen Giap, when talking about the victory of the Vietnamese people's resistance war against French colonialism, said: "This victory powerfully proves that in the current international situation, the liberation struggle of a weak nation can achieve victory through a long-term armed struggle—a protracted war of resistance."

　　After analyzing the current domestic and international situation, Vo Nguyen Giap said, "Our people must strengthen unity, carry out unremitting struggle to defend peace, and at the same time must always be vigilant and never relax the task of fighting against the aggressive and bellicose imperialist bloc and its lackeys."

　　He expressed his belief that the Party's political tasks and lines put forward by the Congress will be a torch illuminating the path forward for the Vietnamese people and achieving new and greater victories. These tasks and lines are also guidelines for consolidating national defense in the new stage.

　　At the afternoon session on the 9th, Nguyen Van Vinh, Chairman of the Central National Unification Committee of the National Assembly, spoke on the struggle for the unification of Vietnam. He condemned US imperialism for illegally transporting weapons in 551 ships to South Vietnam since the restoration of peace, and for building 46 military airports and 11 naval ports there. The number of US military personnel in South Vietnam has now reached 3,272. US imperialism has dispatched aircraft and warships to violate the airspace and territorial waters of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam 57 times.

　　He also said that the US-Ngo Dinh Diem group's actions violated the Geneva Accords, but despite this, we have not changed our attitude in the slightest. We will continue to carry out a resolute struggle to correctly implement these agreements in order to safeguard peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, and to achieve national unification through peaceful methods.

　　At the afternoon session on the 9th, Tran Quoc Hoan spoke on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Others included Nguyen Dinh Thi speaking on literary and artistic work, and Nguyen Thi Thap speaking on women's work.

    范文同强调加强兄弟国家团结和支持被压迫民族的独立运动
  武元甲指出必须提高警惕时刻不放松对帝国主义集团的斗争
    新华社河内9日电　据越南通讯社报道：越南劳动党第三次全国代表大会9日下午继续进行。越南劳动党中央政治局委员、越南民主共和国总理兼外交部长范文同同志在会上作了关于政权和外交政策问题的发言。
    劳动党中央政治局委员、越南人民军总司令武元甲同志作了关于巩固国防和建设人民武装力量问题的发言。
    范文同在发言中说：“越南民主共和国的历史证明了马克思、恩格斯和列宁关于国家政权理论的正确性。”
    范文同完全赞同中央委员会对目前国际局势的基本看法以及胡志明主席和中央委员会的政治报告中提出的关于党的外交方面的基本政策。
    范文同说：“在党的领导下，我国人民决心进一步的增进同社会主义兄弟国家的友谊、团结一致和互助合作，为加强社会主义力量而努力。”
    他说：“我国人民对苏联在建设共产主义事业中所取得的巨大胜利和在科学技术领域中取得的光辉成就，感到无限兴奋。十月革命照亮了全世界工人阶级和被压迫人民的革命道路；在第二次世界大战中，苏联曾经把人类从法西斯的统治下拯救出来，为世界社会主义体系的形成创造了条件；苏联不断地对社会主义兄弟国家的发展经济、文化和建设新生活给予了无私的援助；苏联是被压迫民族争取解放和巩固民族独立的坚决和有力的支持者；苏联是反对侵略和好战的帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义和保卫世界和平的英勇和坚决的战士。伟大的苏联堪称为社会主义阵营之首。”
    他又说：“我国人民对中华人民共和国——一个拥有六亿五千万人口、在世界上尤其是在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各民族中享有日益广泛的信任和影响的大国的迅速强大，感到无比欣慰和振奋。中华人民共和国自从成立以来，对加强社会主义的力量，对促进民族解放运动，对坚决反对美帝国主义，维护和平，都作出了巨大的贡献。美帝国主义愈是敌视中华人民共和国，那么，我们社会主义阵营的兄弟国家和世界人民，就愈是坚决支持伟大的中国人民，坚决要求中华人民共和国在世界上取得应有的地位。”
    他还说：“我们对其它社会主义兄弟国家取得光辉的胜利感到无比兴奋。目前，已有许多国家完成了社会主义改造，有些国家已经或正在完成社会主义建设和准备走向共产主义。”
    范文同说，“越南民族在历史上同东南亚许多民族有着悠久的关系，我国人民的革命过程是一个被压迫民族反对帝国主义侵略斗争的过程。我国目前争取南方解放的斗争是世界民族独立运动的一部分。越南人民神圣的抗战是为被压迫民族解放事业所作出的一个贡献。八月革命和奠边府战役的胜利，不仅是我国人民的巨大胜利，同时也是正在为争取自由而斗争的各民族的共同胜利。我国人民的领袖——胡志明主席是反对帝国主义、争取民族独立斗争的一位战士，他深获亚非各国人民的爱戴和尊敬。”
    他说：“近几年来，许多非洲国家已经取得了民族的独立，我们兴奋和愉快地欢迎这些国家加入世界独立国家的行列，以继续进行反对帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义的侵略，以维护民族独立和世界和平。我们相信越南民主共和国和这些国家之间的友谊关系将获得更好的发展。我国同几内亚共和国已经建立了正式的外交关系，并派遣大使到几内亚首都，这一事件在开辟和发展我国同非洲各国之间的友谊关系的道路上，已标志着前进中的重要的一步。我们特别关心我国同邻邦之间的友好关系。越南民主共和国一向都希望在和平共处五项原则和尊重日内瓦协议基础上同柬埔寨王国和老挝王国建立友好关系。我们高兴地看到我国同柬埔寨王国之间的友好关系的日益发展。我们对柬埔寨王国在西哈努克元首的领导下所采取的和平中立政策表示欢迎和拥护。我们随时准备同老挝王国建立友好关系，只要老挝王国政府认真履行和平中立政策、尊重日内瓦协议和万象协议。老挝人民目前反抗美帝国主义的干涉的爱国运动是老挝人民正在国内到处开展的民族解放斗争的新胜利，也是美帝国主义的一个惨败。”
    他说：“我们永远不会忘记各被压迫民族对我们过去的抗战，和目前争取祖国统一斗争事业的同情和支持。越南人民始终如一地坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各民族反对殖民主义的压迫和反对帝国主义的侵略阴谋的正义斗争。越南人民已经承认阿尔及利亚临时政府和彻底拥护阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争。越南人民坚决支持刚果人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的侵略和分裂刚果国土的阴谋的斗争。在拉丁美洲，正高举着民族独立的旗帜、坚决进行反对美帝国主义的斗争的古巴人民，给拉丁美洲各国人民树立了光辉的榜样。”
    范文同最后说：“我们再一次重申我们赞成和支持苏联和社会主义阵营的和平和和平共处政策以及苏联在关于全面和彻底裁军、要求取消在外国的军事基地、要求禁止试验、储备和使用各种核武器等方面的主张。我们赞成和支持中华人民共和国关于在亚洲和太平洋地区签订一个互不侵犯条约和建立一个无核武器地区的主张。”
    武元甲在发言中谈到越南人民反对法国殖民主义的抗战的胜利时说：“这一胜利有力地证明：在目前的国际形势下，一个弱小民族的解放斗争可以通过长期武装斗争的方式——长期抗战——而取得胜利”。
    武元甲在分析了当前国内和国际形势以后说，“我国人民必须加强团结，为保卫和平而进行不懈的斗争，同时必须时刻提高警惕，时刻都不放松对侵略好战的帝国主义集团及其走狗们进行斗争的任务。”
    他表示相信，大会提出的党的政治任务和路线将是照耀着越南人民的前进道路和取得新的更大胜利的火炬。这些任务和路线也是在新阶段中巩固国防的指针。
    在9日下午的会议上，国会中央国家统一委员会主任阮文咏就统一越南的斗争作了发言。他谴责美帝国主义自从和平恢复以来非法地把装了五百五十一艘船的武器运到越南南方去，并且在那里建造了四十六个军事机场和十一个军港。美国在越南南方的军事人员现在达到三千二百七十二人。美帝国主义先后五十七次派遣飞机和军舰侵犯了越南民主共和国的领空和领水。
    他又说，美国—吴庭艳集团这样做是违反了日内瓦协议的，但是，尽管这样，我们丝毫没有改变我们的态度。我们将继续为正确地履行这些协议而进行坚决的斗争，以便维护印度支那和东南亚和平，并通过和平方法来实现国家的统一。
    在9日下午的大会上，陈国环就关于镇压反革命问题作了发言。其他还有阮庭诗关于文艺工作的发言，阮氏十关于妇女工作的发言等。
