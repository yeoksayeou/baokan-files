Having read the report in the September 5th issue of the People's Daily about He Wenyi, a farmer from the Duanjia Commune in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, studying science and building the countryside, I was deeply moved. He Wenyi, around twenty years old, only attended half a year of elementary school. Two years ago, he was a young farmer who didn't even recognize chemical symbols. To build a new socialist countryside, he set ambitious goals and persevered, diligently studying and, with the help of the Party and the masses, started from "three pots under the stage," overcoming various difficulties to finally build a factory capable of producing over a hundred kinds of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. He himself was also tempered into an outstanding local expert. This revolutionary style is inspiring. I wrote this poem to pay my respects to Comrade He Wenyi from afar.

	I
	Three pots under the stage,
	Three big pots, three piles of fire.
	From the three pots rise colorful clouds,
	The three piles of fire paint a new landscape.
	He Wenyi wears a coarse cloth shirt,
	He Wenyi wears cloth-soled shoes.
	It is this young man from the countryside,
	Who leaps across the heavens to seize science.
	Lofty aspirations stir revolution,
	Revolution fears no difficulties.
	Which high mountain cannot be climbed!
	Which hemp stalk cannot be broken!
	If there is no refrigerator, find a cold cave,
	If there is no platinum, use black iron.
	If there is no experience, strike out on your own,
	If there is no knowledge, learn everywhere.
	Chop up difficulties as raw materials,
	Refine fertilizer to sprinkle on the fields.

	II
	Three pots under the stage,
	Three big pots, three piles of fire.
	Three big pots forge the nation,
	Three piles of raging fire create great undertakings.
	It is this young man,
	Who didn't even graduate from elementary school.
	He can sever the Yellow River and stop its flow,
	He can split the heavens and break through the sky.
	He Wenyi's fertilizer covers the earth,
	Golden millet and silver rice flow into rivers.
	He Wenyi's fertilizer sprinkles the sky,
	The sun, moon, and stars transform into flowers.
	He Wenyi's fertilizer is sown in the sea,
	A thousand rivers and ten thousand streams play songs of triumph.
	He Wenyi's fertilizer spreads among the people,
	Revolutionary seeds fall everywhere.
	One seed, ten thousand flowers,
	Ten thousand flowers embroider a new world.
	The Party's strength is the axe that makes flowers bloom,
	Mountains crack before heroes!

	III
	Three pots under the stage,
	Three big pots, three piles of fire.
	Three big pots carry out revolution,
	Three piles of raging fire break ice and snow.
	The great fire started at Jinggangshan,
	The great fire started at the Dadu River.
	Started in the cave dwellings of Yan'an,
	Started with the blood of revolutionary martyrs.
	The three red banners are the wind and fire fans,
	The people's communes are the sowers of fire.
	He Wenyi stands tall on the earth,
	He Wenyi's name is fire!
	Who says there is only one He Wenyi?
	There are countless more all over the country.
	We have six hundred million He Wenyis,
	We have six hundred million piles of revolutionary fire!
	The great fire blazes into a pillar reaching the sky,
	Ten thousand miles of red light illuminates the world!

    三口大锅三堆火	张志民
    读了9月5日《人民日报》关于陕西省大荔县段家公社农民何文义学习科学、建设农村的报道，深受感动。何文义，二十岁左右，只念过半年高小，两年前还是个连化学符号都不认识的青年农民，为建设祖国新农村，树雄心、立大志，百折不挠，刻苦钻研，在党和群众的帮助下，由“戏台底下三口锅”起家，冲破种种困难，终于建成一座能生产一百多种化肥和农药的工厂。他自己也炼成了一个出色的土专家。这种革命风格，令人鼓舞，写成此诗，向何文义同志千里致敬。	一
    戏台底下三口锅，
    三口大锅三堆火。
    三口锅蒸出五彩云，
    三堆火画出新山河。
    何文义身穿粗布衫，
    何文义脚踏布底鞋。
    就是这个土小伙，
    飞跨天宫夺科学。
    壮志雄心闹革命，
    革命哪怕困难多。
    哪座高山不能攀！
    哪根麻秆不能破！
    没有冰箱找冷洞，
    没有白金用黑铁。
    没有经验自己闯，
    没有知识到处学。
    剁碎困难当原料，
    炼成化肥洒田野。
         二
    戏台底下三口锅，
    三口大锅三堆火。
    三口大锅铸江山，
    三堆烈火创大业。
    就是这个小青年，
    就是高小没毕业。
    要斩黄河水也断，
    要劈九天天也破。
    何文义的化肥铺大地，
    金谷银稻流成河。
    何文义的化肥洒上天，
    日月星辰变花朵。
    何文义的化肥播大海，
    千江万河奏凯歌。
    何文义的化肥传人间，
    革命的种籽遍地落。
    一颗种籽万朵花，
    万花绣出新世界。
    党的力量是开花斧，
    英雄面前山也裂！	三
    戏台底下三口锅，
    三口大锅三堆火。
    三口大锅干革命，
    三堆烈火破冰雪。
    大火起自井冈山，
    大火起自大渡河。
    起自延安土窑洞，
    起自革命先烈血。
    三面红旗是风火扇，
    人民公社是播火者。
    何文义挺身立大地，
    何文义的名字就是火！
    谁说何文义只一个？
    天南地北无限多。
    我们有六万万何文义，
    我们有六亿堆革命火！
    大火炽起通天柱，
    万里红光照世界！
