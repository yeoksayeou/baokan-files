Xinhua News Agency, February 25th. The Ministry of Agriculture issued an urgent notice today, requiring provinces in North China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in areas with snowfall to seize the favorable opportunity to conserve soil moisture with snow and strengthen the management of wheat fields.

The notice said that starting from the 24th, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shandong and other provinces and regions experienced widespread snowfall, with some areas receiving more than twenty millimeters and others three to five millimeters. This is the most widespread snowfall since last winter. This snow is very beneficial to the growth and development of winter wheat and to spring plowing and sowing.

The notice requires that all areas with snowfall should seize this favorable opportunity and do the following work well:

1.  Immediately mobilize the masses to sweep and collect snow and send it to wheat fields and spring sowing land. Accumulating snow is like accumulating grain, and we must not let the snow water flow away in vain. For wheat fields that are far from villages and lack irrigation conditions, we should pay more attention to covering them with more snow. All localities should combine snow accumulation with cleaning rural roads to ensure that transportation is not delayed.

2.  Winter wheat fields should be top-dressed with fertilizer, harrowed, and weeded in time after the snow melts, taking advantage of the moisture. If there is a sudden cold snap after the snow melts, the alternate freezing and thawing may cause the "root pulling" phenomenon of wheat, and timely suppression should be carried out to prevent early spring frost damage. Early sowing of spring wheat is an important measure to strive for a bumper harvest. All localities should take advantage of the moisture to prepare the land and strive for early sowing.

3.  Land that needs to be plowed in spring should be independently plowed, prepared, and harrowed after the snow to reduce water evaporation and facilitate timely spring sowing.

4.  All reservoirs, ponds, and dams should do a good job in storing and conserving water, and seize the time for spring irrigation, without relaxation. (Attached picture)

### 农业部要求各地抓紧有利时机  积雪保墒　管好麦田

    农业部要求各地抓紧有利时机
    积雪保墒　管好麦田
    新华社25日讯　农业部今天发出紧急通知，要求华北各省和内蒙古自治区降雪地区，抓紧有利时机积雪保墒，加强麦田管理。
    通知说，从24日起，山西、陕西、河北、内蒙古、山东等省、区普降瑞雪，多的二十几公厘，少的三、五公厘。这是去冬以来一次范围较广的降雪。这场雪对冬小麦的生长发育以及春耕春播，都很有利。
    通知要求凡是降雪的地区都应抓紧这个有利时机，作好以下工作：
    1、立即发动群众扫雪、积雪，送到麦田和春播地里，积雪如积粮，不让雪水白白流走。对于离村较远和缺乏灌溉条件的麦地，更要注意多盖一些雪。各地要结合积雪，清扫乡间道路，保证不误运输。
    2、冬小麦田应在雪化后及时趁墒追肥、耙麦、锄地。积雪融化后，如有骤寒，可能因结冻、融化的交替作用而引起小麦的“根拔”现象，应及时镇压，防止早春冻害。春小麦提早播种是争取丰收的重要措施，各地应趁墒整地，争取早播。
    3、春季需要耕翻的土地，应趁雪后独立进行翻地、整地、耙地，减少水分蒸发，以利及时春播。
    4、一切水库、塘、堰要做好蓄水保水工作，抓紧春灌，不要放松。（附图片）
