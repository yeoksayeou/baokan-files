    Review of "A Draft History of the People's Republic of China"
    Compiled by the Third Grade Collective of the History Department of Hebei Beijing Normal College, Published by People's Publishing House
    Li Fan
    It has been less than ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China. However, these are ten extremely glorious and great years in Chinese history. In these nearly ten years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country have not only achieved the great victory of the socialist revolution but also successfully carried out large-scale socialist construction. Now, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, our people are striving with soaring revolutionary vigor, to build our country into a great socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern socialist culture. To scientifically expound and summarize the history of these great ten years is undoubtedly a very important task with significant political meaning. "A Draft History of the People's Republic of China" (published by People's Publishing House, hereinafter referred to as "History Draft"), collectively compiled by sixty-three students and five young teachers from the Third Grade of the History Department of Hebei Beijing Normal College, is an attempt at this task. The revolutionary enthusiasm of some of the young comrades who compiled the "History Draft" and the courageous spirit they demonstrated in the face of scientific work are commendable. They did make an effort in the process of writing. However, it is undeniable that, as a history of the People's Republic of China, it still has some serious flaws. Here, I would like to offer some preliminary opinions on the main shortcomings of the "History Draft."
    First, from the style and content of the "History Draft," it can be seen that it relies solely on excerpts from some readily available materials, rather than on in-depth and systematic research on the history of our country since its founding. This is a fundamental weakness of the "History Draft." Therefore, we can only see a collection of individual facts and superficial phenomena from the "History Draft," and it is difficult to see the internal connections in the development process of our country's history over the past nearly ten years. Of course, the important policy documents of the Party and the state, and the works of Chairman Mao, are the theoretical basis for compiling the history of the People's Republic of China; however, when citing these documents and works, specific historical facts should be used to illustrate the background of the emergence of various policies of the Party and the state, as well as the results of the implementation of these policies, and so on. Only by explaining it in practice and theory can we reveal the objective laws of historical development, so that readers can understand how the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong creatively combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, so that our revolutionary cause and socialist construction cause are advancing from one victory to an even greater victory. The "History Draft" has done very poorly in this regard. What we see in this book, besides excerpts from policy documents of the Party and the state, are only some simple pronouncements, or using one document to explain another; as for the domestic political and economic situation, class relations, and the situation of class struggle in various periods, they are rarely specifically narrated and analyzed. For example, the Five Great Movements, the Three Great Transformations, the Rectification Movement, and the Anti-Rightist Struggle carried out in our country during the transition period, under what specific circumstances were they proposed and carried out, the Party's general line for the transition period and the Party's general line for socialist construction, under what objective actual circumstances were they formulated, and how did they reflect the class struggle during the transition period, reflect the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, and reflect the laws of socialist struggle and socialist construction, etc., have not been scientifically reflected in the "History Draft."
    Secondly, as a history of the People's Republic of China, it should give appropriate scientific status to the various important historical events of our country in the past ten years, according to the role they played in historical development, and make realistic evaluations; it should not simply list some historical phenomena regardless of importance, or add some arbitrary judgments without analysis. The "History Draft" is precisely careless and negligent on such an issue. For example, the "History Draft" made a very brief narrative of the land reform, which has extremely important historical significance, using only four pages. In the section "New Development of the Chinese Workers' Movement," it only narrates some situations, without explaining what "new development" the workers' movement had in this period. There is a lack of organic connection between some chapters, and some content is arranged irrelevantly, and even problems of different natures are discussed together. For example, the fifth section of the third chapter puts the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries and the ideological criticism of the bourgeoisie in one topic, which is also inappropriate. Related to this shortcoming, the "History Draft" also made inappropriate evaluations of several historical events. When discussing the significance of land reform, it said that land reform "completely liberated the rural productive forces"; if that were really the case, then how should we estimate the role of subsequent changes in production relations, such as the mutual aid and cooperation movement, agricultural collectivization, and the rural people's commune movement, as well as the future transition from collective ownership in rural areas to ownership by the whole people, on the liberation of productive forces? The "History Draft" says that the Three-Anti Movement achieved the "goal of eradicating evil thoroughly," which is also an incorrect statement. Saying this will at least lead to two misunderstandings: one is that it is easy to confuse the Three-Anti Movement with the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries; the other is that it is easy to give people the impression that after the Three-Anti Movement, the class struggle ended, and there is no need to fight against bad people and bad things anymore. The "History Draft" also made some very unrealistic assertions about certain things. For example, it says that the quick literacy method not only "greatly shortened the process of eliminating illiteracy among hundreds of millions of workers and peasants," but also "will enable our great Chinese nation to regain its position at the forefront of world civilization and forever get rid of... the state of poverty and ignorance." The "History Draft" made this assessment of music, art, and scientific research during the three years of the national economic recovery period: "It has made an inestimable contribution to promoting the country's various constructions." Obviously, these estimates are exaggerated. Although the quick literacy method played a certain role in eliminating illiteracy under certain conditions, in any case, it cannot be said that the quick literacy method would enable the working people to "forever get rid of the state of poverty and ignorance." During the three years of the national economic recovery period, music, art, and scientific research work had certain achievements, but in any case, it cannot be said that it "made an inestimable contribution." These are just a few examples; situations like this in the "History Draft" are not isolated.
    Third, another relatively prominent flaw in the "History Draft" is that in some places, it made improper explanations of the policies of the Party and the state, and the wording of some issues in domestic life is also inaccurate. For example, when the "History Draft" talked about the Party's policy towards the national bourgeoisie, it said: "After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party and the government resolutely implemented the policy of protecting the national bourgeoisie." This is incorrect. The Party and the state adopted a policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and for the national bourgeoisie, a policy of actively winning over, uniting and struggling, and seeking unity through struggle, and gradually transforming them into self-reliant laborers. We should never generalize this as a "policy of protecting the national bourgeoisie." The "History Draft" said when explaining our country's ethnic relations: "The Han people have a large population, and the minority nationalities have vast resources; this is precisely what requires close cooperation and mutual assistance among all nationalities..." This not only does not analyze the differences in political, economic, and cultural aspects formed by the relationship between the Han and minority nationalities due to historical conditions, but also does not point out the consistency of the interests of all ethnic groups in our country and the close unity, friendship, and mutual assistance under the common goal of building socialism, but simply attributes the premise of "close cooperation and mutual assistance" between the Han nationality and the minority nationalities to "the Han nationality has a large population, and the minority nationalities have vast resources." This explanation is also incorrect, at least very incomplete. The "History Draft" also described the four Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies transferred to our country by the Soviet Union in 1954 as "the first batch of socialist enterprises after the founding of our country"; are the state-owned enterprises nationalized by our country after the liberation and confiscated from bureaucratic capital not socialist enterprises? In addition, it should be specially pointed out that the discussion of many issues in the "History Draft" also has important errors when it comes to international relations.
    Finally, there are many places in the "History Draft" where the wording is inappropriate and the meaning is unclear. The roughness of the writing is also a shortcoming of the "History Draft."
    The above are just some preliminary opinions after reading the "History Draft"; if there are any errors, I hope to receive criticism and corrections. Here, I would also like to say a few extra words. Compiling the history of the People's Republic of China is a serious political work, and it is also a brand-new and arduous scientific work that requires hard work. Therefore, if one has not already had an in-depth study of the history of the People's Republic of China, then it is more difficult to do this work well in just twenty days. The young comrades of Hebei Beijing Normal College bravely carried out this work, and this enthusiasm and vigor are good. However, after all, due to the overly tight schedule, the "History Draft" inevitably has some serious flaws. This also shows that in dealing with scientific work, we must combine enthusiasm with calmness and boldness with care.
  In addition, if the "History Draft" is used as a teaching reference material, it still has a certain effect on helping students understand the history of our country in the past ten years. However, it is not serious for the People's Publishing House, a national publishing house, to publish it easily. Some newspapers have made excessive evaluations of the "History Draft." For example, the Hebei Daily published an article by the newspaper's commentator, which believed that the "History Draft" "has opened a new page in the work of historical scientific research," which is also inappropriate. Individual participants in the "History Draft" compilation work made excessive exaggerations of their work in the newspapers. For example, Li Rongpu, director of the History Department of Hebei Beijing Normal College, published an article in Guangming Daily: actually believes that the "History Draft" is a work with the "strongest Party spirit and scientific nature." Some people even published poems in the Hebei Daily, calling the "History Draft" a "satellite of historical creation." This approach is also inappropriate.

    评“中华人民共和国史稿”
    河北北京师范学院历史系三年级集体编写　人民出版社出版
    里凡
    中华人民共和国成立到现在，还不过将近十年。但是，这是中国历史上极其光荣伟大的十年。在这将近十年的时间里面，全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，不仅取得了社会主义革命的伟大胜利，而且胜利地进行了大规模的社会主义建设。现在，我国人民正在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，以冲天的革命干劲，为把我国建设成为具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。把这伟大十年的历史加以科学的阐述和总结，无疑地是一件十分重要的和具有重大政治意义的工作。河北北京师范学院历史系三年级的六十三位同学和五位青年教师集体编写的“中华人民共和国史稿”（人民出版社出版，以下简称“史稿”），就是对这件工作的一种尝试。编写“史稿”的一些青年同志们的革命热情和在科学工作面前所表现的勇敢精神，是很可贵的。他们在编写的过程中也确实作了一番努力。但是，不容否认，作为一部中华人民共和国的历史，它还存在着一些严重的缺陷。在这里，我想对“史稿”的主要缺陷，提出一些初步意见。
    首先，从“史稿”的体例和内容可以看出，它只是依靠对一些现成材料的摘录，而不是依靠对我国建国以来历史的深入的和系统的研究而写成的，这是“史稿”的一个根本弱点。因此，我们从“史稿”中只能看到一些个别事实和表面现象的堆砌，而很难看出我国将近十年历史发展过程的内在联系。当然，党和国家的重要政策文件，毛主席的著作，是编写中华人民共和国历史的理论根据；但是，在引用这些文件和著作的时候，应该用具体的历史事实，说明党和国家各种政策产生的背景，以及这些政策执行的结果，等等。只有这样从实际上和理论上进行说明，才能够揭示历史发展的客观规律，使读者了解中国共产党和毛泽东同志是怎样创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合，使我国的革命事业和社会主义建设事业，从一个胜利奔向一个更大的胜利。“史稿”在这方面作得是很差的。我们在本书中看到的除了党和国家政策文件的摘录而外，仅仅是一些简单的断语，或者以一个文件去解释另一个文件；至于各个时期国内的政治经济状况，阶级关系和阶级斗争的情况，则很少加以具体的叙述和分析。比如，在我国过渡时期中所进行五大运动、三大改造，以及整风运动、反右斗争等，究竟是在怎样的具体情况下提出和开展的，党在过渡时期的总路线和党的社会主义建设的总路线，究竟是在怎样的客观实际情况下制定的，以及它们是怎样地反映了过渡时期的阶级斗争、反映了社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，是怎样地反映了社会主义斗争和社会主义建设的规律等等，都没有在“史稿”中得到科学的反映。
    其次，作为一部中华人民共和国的历史，应该对我国近十年来的各个重要历史事件，根据它们在历史发展中所起的作用，给以恰当的科学地位，作出实事求是的估价；而不应该不分轻重主次地简单罗列一些历史现象，或者不加分析地加上一些任意的评断。“史稿”恰恰在这样一个问题上失之轻率和疏忽。比如，“史稿”对具有极为重大历史意义的土地改革，作了十分简略的叙述，只不过用了四页的篇幅。在“中国职工运动的新发展”一节中，只是叙述了一些情况，而并没有说明究竟在这个时期内职工运动有了怎样的“新发展”。有些章节之间缺乏有机的联系，互不关联地安排了一些内容，甚至把不同性质的问题，放在一起来论述。比如，在第三章第五节就是把肃反和对资产阶级的思想批判放在一个题目里面，这也是不够妥当的。同这个缺点相联系，“史稿”对若干历史事件也作了不恰当的评断。在论到土地改革的意义的时候，说土地改革使“农村生产力获得彻底的解放”；果真如此，那么以后的互助合作运动、农业合作化和农村人民公社化，以及将来的由农村中的集体所有制过渡到全民所有制这一系列的生产关系的变革对生产力的解放作用又当怎样估计呢？“史稿”说三反运动达到了“除恶务尽的目的”，这也是不正确的说法。这样说至少会使人发生两种误解，一是容易把三反运动同镇压反革命的斗争混淆起来；二是容易给人一种印象，好像经过三反运动，阶级斗争就结束了，再不要和坏人坏事作斗争了。“史稿”还对某些事情作了很不切合实际的论断。比如，说速成识字法不但“大大缩短了扫除亿万工农文盲的过程”，而且“将使我们伟大的中华民族重新恢复到世界文明的前列，永远摆脱……贫困愚昧状态”。对国民经济恢复时期三年中间的音乐、美术和科学研究，“史稿”作了这样的估计：“在推进祖国各项建设中作出了不可估计的贡献。”显然，这些估计都是过分夸大了。速成识字法虽然在一定条件下对扫除文盲起过一定的作用，但是无论如何不能说有了速成识字法就会使劳动人民“永远摆脱贫困愚昧状态”。国民经济恢复时期的三年中，音乐、美术工作和科学研究工作有一定的成绩，但是无论如何不能说“作出了不可估计的贡献”。我们知道，没有经济建设的发展，没有巩固的经济基础，文化艺术和科学研究工作是不可能高度发展的，何况在当时我国尚处在国民经济恢复时期。这里只是举出几个例子，“史稿”中类似这样的情况，并不是个别的。
    第三，“史稿”的另一个比较显著的缺陷，就是在一些地方对党和国家的政策作了不够妥当的解释，对国内生活中的某些问题的提法也不确切。比如，“史稿”在谈到党对民族资产阶级的政策时说：“中华人民共和国成立之后，党和政府坚决执行了保护民族资产阶级的政策”这就是不正确的。党和国家对资本主义工商业是采取利用、限制和改造的政策，对民族资产阶级分子，则是采取了积极争取、又团结又斗争、以斗争求团结的政策，并要逐步地把他们改造成为自食其力的劳动者。我们绝不应该笼统地把这说成是“保护民族资产阶级的政策”。“史稿”在解释我国民族关系时说：“汉族人口众多，少数民族地大物博，这正需要各民族密切合作，互相帮助……”这里既没有对汉族和少数民族由于历史条件的关系所形成的在政治、经济、文化方面的不同情况加以分析，也没有指出我国各民族利益的一致性和在建设社会主义这一共同目标下，亲密团结，友爱互助，而把汉民族和少数民族“密切合作，互相帮助”的前提简单归结为“汉族人口众多，少数民族地大物博”。这种解释也是不正确，至少是很不全面的。“史稿”还把1954年苏联移交给我国的四个中苏合营的公司，说成是“我国成立后的第一批社会主义企业”；难道我国在解放后没收官僚资本归国家所有的国营企业，不是社会主义企业吗？另外，应该特别提出，“史稿”在讲到国际关系时，对不少问题的论述，也有重要的错误。
    最后，“史稿”中措词不当，语义不清的地方是很多的。文字的粗糙，也是“史稿”的一个缺点。
    以上这些，只是读了“史稿”以后的一些初步意见；有错误的地方，希望得到批评和指正。在这里，我还想说几句题外的话。编写中华人民共和国的历史，这是一件严肃的政治工作，同时也是一件崭新的和艰巨的科学工作，要求支付出辛勤的劳动。因此，如果不是对中华人民共和国的历史已经有了深刻的研究，那末要在短短的二十天内做好这件工作，是比较困难的。河北北京师范学院的青年同志们，勇敢地进行了这件工作，这种热情和干劲是好的。但是，毕竟由于时间过于仓促，“史稿”就不可避免地发生一些严重的缺陷。这也说明，对待科学工作，要把热情同冷静、大胆同细心结合起来。
  此外，“史稿”如果作为一种教学参考材料，它对帮助学生了解我国十年来的历史，还是有一定作用的。但是，作为国家出版社的人民出版社轻易地把它出版，这是不严肃的。有的报纸对“史稿”作了过高的评价，例如河北日报刊登了一篇该报评论员的文章，认为
  “史稿”是“在历史科学研究工作中揭开了新的一页”，这也是不妥当的。“史稿”编写工作的个别参加者，在报纸上对自己的工作作了过分的渲染。例如，河北北京师范学院历史系主任李荣朴在光明日报上发表文章：实际上认为“史稿”是一本“党性和科学性最强的”著作。甚至有人在河北日报上发表诗歌，把“史稿”称作“历史创作的卫星”。这种做法也是不合适的。
