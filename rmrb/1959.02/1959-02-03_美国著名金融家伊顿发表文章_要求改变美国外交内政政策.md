Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 2nd: Prominent American industrialist and financier Cyrus Eaton published an article in the "Nation" magazine on January 31st, calling for changes in US foreign and domestic policies.

    Eaton first called for the removal of Secretary of State Dulles. He pointed out that Dulles's foreign policy was "gambling with the fate of the world," and that "he is apparently unmoved by the results of the 1958 (Congressional) elections, which were disastrous for the Republican Party precisely because of his inflammatory activities."

    Eaton advocated mutual visits between the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States, "to have President Eisenhower visit the Soviet Union, and Premier Khrushchev visit the United States." He believes that since the United States spends $50 billion annually on military affairs, the head of the US government should certainly make an effort to deal with the head of the Soviet government. Eaton also called for the United States to recognize the People's Republic of China and restore China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. He accused the US government of being "determined to antagonize the 600 million people on the mainland and to form a useless alliance with Chiang Kai-shek, in place of our (America's) long friendship with this glorious and powerful nation." He said, "Chiang Kai-shek is merely an outdated exile figure whom we have placed and maintained on a nearby island at a tremendously heavy sacrifice to American taxpayers."

    Eaton also advocated that the United States conclude a treaty of peace and friendship with the Soviet Union, halt the nuclear arms race, cease interfering in the affairs of other countries, and allow scientists and scholars from all countries to exert influence on their governments for the sake of peace. In discussing the need for the United States to cease interfering in the affairs of other countries, he said, "The newspapers of countries such as Denmark, France, Germany, Austria, and Great Britain are unanimously criticizing our policies. Senior officials of our government can no longer visit South American countries without causing unrest." Eaton said that in the United States' "neighbor and best customer, Canada," the current ruling party has also stated that it lacks enthusiasm for the United States, "if not complete hostility."

    In terms of domestic policy, Eaton proposed that the US government abolish the secret activities of the American police organization and change its fanatical anti-communist attitude. He pointed out that the American people have suffered greatly due to the fascist measures taken by the US government, such as censorship and fingerprinting, secret agents and wiretapping, and surveillance.

    美国著名金融家伊顿发表文章
    要求改变美国外交内政政策
    新华社2日讯　纽约消息：美国著名工业家和金融家赛勒斯·伊顿1月31日在“民族”周刊发表一篇文章，要求改变美国的外交和内政政策。
    伊顿首先要求把国务卿杜勒斯撤职。他指出，杜勒斯的外交政策是“拿世界的命运来赌博”，“他显然对1958年的（国会）选举结果无动于衷，而正是他的煽动性的活动促使共和党在选举中遭到惨败。”
    伊顿主张苏美两国领导人相互访问，“使艾森豪威尔总统访问苏联，赫鲁晓夫总理访问美国”。他认为，既然美国每年在军事方面要花五百亿美元，美国政府首脑当然应当作一番努力来同苏联政府首脑打交道。伊顿也要求美国承认中华人民共和国和恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位。他指责美国政府“决意招惹大陆的六亿中国人产生敌意，并且同蒋介石结成毫无用处的联盟，来代替我们（美国）同这个光荣、强大的国家的悠久友谊。”他说，“蒋介石只不过是我们在使美国纳税人遭到奇重的牺牲的情况下，安置和保持在邻近的一个岛屿上的流亡的过时人物。”
    伊顿还主张美国同苏联缔结和平和友好条约，停止核军备竞赛，不再干涉其他国家事务，使世界各国的科学家和学者为了和平对他们的政府施展影响。他在谈到要求美国不再干涉其他国家事务时说，“丹麦、法国、德国、奥地利和英国等国家的报纸正在异口同声地批评我国的政策。我们的政府高级官员要访问南美国家而不引起骚乱是再也办不到了。”伊顿说，在美国的“近邻和最好的主顾加拿大”，目前的执政党也曾声称对美国缺乏热情，如果不是完全抱有敌意的话。”
    在国内政策方面，伊顿提出了要求美国政府废除美国警察组织的秘密活动，改变疯狂反共的态度等主张。他指出，由于美国政府采取审查和按手印、密探和偷听电话以及侦察等等法西斯措施，美国人民已受尽折磨。
