Title: Confidence is Growing Stronger

    Recently, I've been pondering a question: What enabled our "poor and blank" nation to double its steel, coal, grain, and cotton production in just one year? What created these miracles? Some might say it's the drive of 600 million people; but then, what gives our people such great drive? Workers at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai said: "In difficult circumstances, we must see the positive factors, see the prospects for development, and then we can strengthen our confidence in overcoming difficulties." This statement is correct and well said!

    Our country's economic level is very backward, but despite the poor original conditions, the Party always teaches us to see the positive factors in difficulties, to see the prospects for development. Therefore, we are full of confidence in achieving our great goals. This confidence gives us strength; this strength enables us to create miracles that shock the capitalist world; and these miracles further enhance our confidence in moving forward.

    We have always been full of confidence, because we believe that the cause of communism is a new and just cause, with strong vitality. In the course of historical development, we are getting better day by day; despite difficulties and twists, we will eventually achieve the final and complete victory. When have we ever lost confidence? Never. When climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing the grasslands, we were full of confidence; when the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek surrounded the liberated areas, we were full of confidence; when making strategic withdrawals from Yan'an, we were full of confidence. It was this confidence that enabled our revolutionary martyrs to laugh loudly at the enemy's bayonets before their execution; that enabled us to see the bright sunshine in the years of darkness. Now, in carrying out the great socialist construction, our confidence is growing stronger and stronger. We saw this confidence last year, and this year, we have also seen this confidence in the recent nationwide upsurge of fertilizer accumulation. Look: "Wheat must resolutely catch up with rice, do everything possible to protect the seedlings, make the first-class seedlings jump, eliminate the third-class seedlings, and let millions of strong seedlings survive the winter." Is this not a manifestation of increasing confidence and determination?

    Confidence is truly a good thing; it gives us the spirit to swallow mountains and rivers, and the heroic spirit to despise all difficulties. We are thorough materialists, of course we must understand how to work practically, to overcome one concrete difficulty after another on the road forward, so that we can move forward step by step; only by accumulating countless solid steps can we form our final and complete victory. However, we are also bold idealists, to draw the newest and most beautiful pictures on a blank sheet of paper; any difficulty is not a problem for us; we have firm confidence in realizing our ideals.

    We have firm confidence, also because we see not only things, but also people. The failure of all conservatives lies in the fact that they only see things and not people, and they have not truly seen things either. The things in their eyes are only dead, static, and unchangeable things; while the things in our eyes are dynamic, changing, and have their own laws of development. The people in their eyes can only be slaves of things; while the people in our eyes are people who can actively promote its accelerated development and change according to the objective laws of things. Look: The liberated productive forces, the awakened people, have created what kind of miracles last year! Is this not proof of the great role of "people"?

    Our leaping forward tasks this year are greater and more arduous than last year. To complete these tasks, we need to exert greater drive and wisdom; however, we also have greater confidence than last year. Where does this confidence come from? It comes from seeing the beauty of our development prospects, from seeing the positive factors. What are the positive factors? First, the correctness and strength of the Party's leadership; second, the great achievements and rich experience of last year; third, the further improvement of the people's awareness and the greater strength… With these positive factors, we firmly believe that this year's leaping forward targets will be achieved, and this year's miracles will be more and greater. We sing triumphant songs and continue to move forward with full confidence!

### 信心越来越足

    信心越来越足
    黄月
    最近，我常想一个问题：是什么东西使我们这个“一穷二白”的国家，在去年一年的时间里，实现了钢、煤、粮、棉产量翻一番？是什么东西，使我们创造了这些奇迹？有人会说，这是六亿人民的干劲；那么，又是什么东西，使我们的人民有着这样大的干劲？上海江南造船厂工人说：“在困难的环境下，要看到积极的因素，要看到发展的前途，才能增强克服困难的信心。”这句话，说得对，说得好！
    我们国家的经济水平是很落后的，但尽管原有的条件是如此之差，然而，党总是教导我们在困难中要看到积极的因素，看到发展的前途，因此，我们在实现伟大的目标时，充满了信心。这信心，给了我们力量；这力量，使我们创造了使资本主义世界震惊的奇迹；而这奇迹，更增强了我们前进的信心。
    我们从来是信心十足的，因为我们相信共产主义事业是新生的正义的事业，有着强大的生命力。在历史发展过程中，我们一天天好起来；尽管有困难和曲折，我们终将获得最后的完全的胜利。什么时候我们丧失过信心？没有。当爬雪山过草地时，我们信心十足；当日寇和蒋介石包围解放区时，我们信心十足；当从延安作战略上的撤退时，我们信心十足。正是这种信心，使我们的先烈，在临刑之前，对着敌人的刺刀高声大笑；使我们在黑暗笼罩的年代看到灿烂的阳光。现在，进行伟大的社会主义建设时，我们的信心越来越足了。去年我们看到了这种信心，今年，我们在最近全国热火朝天的积肥高潮中，也看到了这种信心。看吧：“三麦要坚决赶水稻，千方百计保好苗，叫一类苗跳一跳，叫三类苗消灭掉，让百万壮苗好过冬。”这难道不是信心愈来愈足、决心愈来愈大的表现？
    信心，这真是一个好东西，它使我们有气吞山河的气魄，有藐视一切困难的豪气。我们是彻底的唯物主义者，当然要懂得脚踏实地的工作，切实地克服前进道路上的一个一个具体的困难，才能一步一步地前进；只有积无数踏实的步伐，才能构成我们最后的完全的胜利。然而，我们也是大胆的理想主义者，要在白纸上，画出最新最美的图画；任何困难，对于我们说来，都是不在话下；对于实现理想，我们有着坚强的信心。
    我们有坚强的信心，也还由于我们不仅见到物，而且见到了人。一切保守派的失败，就在于他们只见物不见人，而且也没有真正地见到物。他们眼中的物，只是一些死的、静止的、不能发展和变化的物；而我们眼中的物，是动的、变化的、有着它的发展规律的物。他们眼中的人，只能是物的奴隶；而我们眼中的人，是能够根据物的客观规律，积极地推动它加速发展和变化的人。看吧：解放了的生产力，觉醒了的人民，在去年创造了怎样的奇迹！难道这不是“人”的伟大作用的证明？
    我们今年的跃进任务，比去年更大更艰巨，要完成这任务，需要发挥更大的干劲和智慧；然而，我们也有比去年更大的信心。这信心从何而来？从看到我们发展前途的美好而来，从看到积极因素而来。有哪些积极因素呢？一曰党的领导的正确和坚强；二曰去年的巨大成就和丰富经验；三曰人民觉悟的更提高，力量的更雄厚……。有这些积极因素，我们坚信，今年的跃进指标一定能实现，今年的奇迹一定会更多更大。我们高唱凯歌，信心十足地继续前进！
