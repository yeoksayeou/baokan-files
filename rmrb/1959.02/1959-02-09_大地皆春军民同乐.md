    The people enjoy longevity and the harvest is plentiful, unprecedented in history. We are in an era where spring is eternal in all seasons, and everywhere is full of the beautiful scenery of spring. People are laboring, living, and singing in the spring breeze all the time. Now, to bring up "The Land is All Spring" is only because during this great festival, amidst rest and entertainment, and in joyful conversations with relatives and friends, we cannot help but look back at the glorious achievements of the past year and look forward to the even more splendid scenery before us, feeling more and more that the spring is rich, the meaning is harmonious, and the joy is boundless.
    It is a natural human sentiment to think of loved ones during festivals. Now, the whole country is our family, and we have deep concern and better wishes for each other. We especially miss our army. Because this is our tradition. Some have compared the army and the people to fish and water, but in fact, our army is our own flesh and blood, it is a part of our working people. Since the day the people's army was born, there has always been a family-like relationship between the army and the people. The army supports the government and cherishes the people, and the people support the army and give preferential treatment to their families. This is a revolutionary tradition that we have never interrupted for a moment. Even in those difficult years of frequent battles, the army and the people would never give up any opportunity to have joint celebrations and entertainment during the New Year and holidays. Anyone who has had contact with our army, who has had any kind of contact, who could not recall this precious connection and contact during this joyous festival?
    In the sound of firecrackers and laughter, I am again immersed in this kind of memory.
    More than a decade ago, in a small county south of Yan'an, in a mountain valley called Qingquangou, our army was stationed. With the arrival of this army, rice grew on the river beach, halls were erected on the hillside, weapons were added to the militia, and joy was added to the masses.
    The New Year was approaching (the Spring Festival was then called the Great Year). The masses from all over the county were discussing how to make the army celebrate a "local New Year". The three-level cadre meeting being held in the county also discussed this matter after discussing production issues. I still remember the speech of the old county head at the meeting. The county head spoke with the local accent of Yanchang County. He said: It is a good thing that the masses want the families of soldiers to have a good New Year, and want the army to have a "local New Year". This is also easy to do, as long as the masses contribute a little of their New Year's dishes and New Year's meals, such as tofu, bean sprouts, fried dough cakes, vermicelli...etc., then the army can eat local-style New Year's dishes and New Year's meals. As soon as the meeting adjourned, the sound of "tofu, bean sprouts, fried dough cakes..." immediately spread throughout the county's rivers.
    Soon, people carried pigs and sheep, and carried tofu, bean sprouts, fried dough cakes, vermicelli...in bamboo baskets, led by the red flags of supporting the army and the sound of gongs and drums, and sent them to the troops. On the day of the Spring Festival, the surrounding masses pulled the soldiers in groups of twos and threes to their homes, on warm adobe beds, and invited them to taste the sweet and thick wine made by their own hands.
    Then came the New Year's Yangko dance, land boats, Taiping carts, and waist drums. Dancing, twisting, the umbrella leader spinning the umbrella, the gongs and drums stopped, and the singing began: "When the gongs and drums stop, I begin to speak, I wish our army a Happy New Year; the army and the people are one family, united in joy for ten thousand years. Hey! One ya hey, united in joy for ten thousand years."
    The work of the troops supporting the government and cherishing the people was carried out even more enthusiastically. It goes without saying that the activities of loving the people before and after the New Year. During the New Year, large banquets were held to entertain the local elders, treating them cordially, always ensuring they were drunk and full before they left. In the evening, the army and the people had a joint celebration, with lanterns and decorations, repairing wood to make knives and guns, painting red as masks, and performing Beijing opera and Erhuang opera. In the cold wind of the deep night, everyone watched with great interest. Even now, when I recall it, it still leaves a pleasant aftertaste.
    More than a decade has passed. Our army and people have greatly developed and improved in terms of ideological level, mental outlook, and various qualities. The cause of socialist construction has united us more closely. To describe such a fragment of past life at this time is not only to induce everyone to recall past stories of unity and friendship, adding more joy to the festival; more importantly, it is to "review the old and know the new", to see clearly the present development and a better future through comparison. In fact, the common joy and happiness during the festival is only one aspect of the relationship between the army and the people. Our relationship between the army and the people is more manifested in the common life of fighting, production, and construction. The history of more than 30 years shows everywhere that our army and people are an inseparable whole. Under the leadership of the Party, every large-scale mass revolutionary action and every major social movement must promote the political ideology of our army to move forward. And the army, which is "both a fighting team and a working team", is a powerful factor in promoting every major mass movement and production and construction movement. Haven't we already seen that last year's great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the high tide of people's communes have promoted the ideological leap forward of the troops? The people's commune has become the most important teaching material for the troops' socialist ideological education. And our troops not only use the artillery fire on the Fujian front to protect our industrial and agricultural construction and the people's commune movement, but also use various forces to support industrial and agricultural production, support the whole people in running iron and steel, and vigorously help the development and construction of the people's communes.
    The army and the people are advancing side by side on the broad road of socialist construction, and the more they advance, the more closely they are united. This kind of flesh-and-blood relationship, advancing side by side, will surely bring greater joy to next year's Spring Festival!

### 大地皆春军民同乐

    大地皆春军民同乐
    葛德
    人寿年丰，旷古空前，我们所处的正是一年四季春常在，到处满眼好春光的时代，人们无时无地不在春风荡漾中劳动、生活、欢唱。现在还来提“大地皆春”，只是因为在这大好节日里，休息、娱乐之余，同亲友们欢晤叙谈中，不免回顾到过去一年的光辉成就，展望眼前更为灿烂的美景，越加觉得春浓意洽欢欣无限罢了。
    佳节思亲，是人的常情。现在我们举国上下是亲人，彼此有着深切的关怀，更好的祝愿。我们倍加思念的又是我们的军队。因为这是我们的传统。有人曾把军民比作鱼水，其实，我们的军队，是我们的亲骨肉，它是我们劳动人民的一部分。自从人民军队诞生那一天起，军民间始终有着亲如家人的关系。军队拥政爱民，人民拥军优属，这是我们一刻也未曾间断过的革命传统。即使在那战斗频繁的艰苦年代里，逢年遇节，军民之间总也不放弃联欢同乐的一切机会。凡是同我们的军队发生过联系，有过接触的，谁能不在这欢乐的节日里，回忆这种宝贵的联系和接触呢？
    鞭炮和欢笑声中，我又沉醉在这种回忆里了。
    十几年前，在延安南边的一个小县份里，在一条叫作清泉沟的山沟里，驻扎了我们的军队。随着这支军队的到来，河滩上长出了水稻，山坡上立起了厅厦，民兵中增加了武器，群众中添长了欢乐。
    要过大年了（那时的春节还叫大年）。全县各地的群众，都在纷纷议论要想法使军队过一个“咱这地方的年”。正在县上举行的三级干部会议，讨论完了生产问题以后，也讨论了这件事。我还记得那位老县长在会上的讲话。县长说话带有延长县的土音，他说：群众要叫军属过好年，叫军队过一个“咱这地方的年”，这意思很好。这也很好办，只要群众把年菜年饭献出一点来，像那透（豆）腐呀，透（豆）芽呀，油磨（馍）呀，粉条呀，……等等，就可以使军队吃到当地风味的年菜年饭。会议一散，这透腐呀，透芽呀，油磨呀……的声音，立即传遍了全县几道川。
    不久，人们便盛载猪羊，用簸箩抬着豆腐、豆芽、油馍、粉条……在拥军红旗和锣鼓声导引之下，纷纷送到部队上去。到春节那天，周围群众更是把三三两两的战士，拉到自己家中，暖窑热炕之上，请他们尝一尝亲手制作的甜稠酒。
    接着是拜年的秧歌、旱船、太平车、腰鼓。跳着，扭着，领伞的转着伞，锣鼓一煞，开腔便唱：“锣鼓一停我开言，我给咱军队来拜年；军民本是一家人，团结欢乐万万年。哎?一呀哎，团结欢乐万万年。”
    部队里的拥政爱民工作开展得更热闹。年前年后爱民活动，不用说了。过年的时候大设筵席，宴请当地父老，殷勤招待，总要使之醉饱方休。晚上，军民联欢，张灯结彩，修木为刀枪，涂红作面谱，演唱京戏二簧。深夜寒风中，人人竟看得眉飞色舞。至今回忆起来，还津津有余味的。
    十几年过去了。我们的军队和人民，思想水平，精神面貌，以及各种素质都有了很大发展和提高。社会主义建设事业，把我们团结得更紧密了。这时来述说这样一个过去生活的片断，不只是为了诱人各自回忆过去的团结友谊的往事，在节日里更添一番欢乐；更重要的是“温故知新”，从比较中看清现在的发展和更好的将来。其实，节日中的同欢共乐，只不过是军民关系的一个侧面，我们军民关系，更多的表现在共同的战斗、生产、建设的生活中。三十多年来的历史，处处都显示着我们的军队和人民是一个血肉不可分割的整体。在党的领导下，每一次大规模的群众革命行动，每一个重大的社会运动，都要推动我们军队的政治思想向前进。而作为“是战斗队又是工作队”的军队，又是推动每一个重大群众运动和生产建设运动的有力因素。我们不是已经看到：去年工农业生产的大跃进，人民公社化的高潮，推动了部队政治思想的跃进，人民公社化，成了部队社会主义思想教育的最重要的教材。而我们的部队，不仅用福建前线的炮火，保卫着我们工农业的建设、人民公社运动，而且用各种力量来支援工农业生产，支援全民大办钢铁，并大力帮助人民公社的发展和建设。
    军民并肩行进在社会主义建设的康庄大道上，愈前进便愈加团结得紧密。这种骨肉相亲、并肩前进的关系，一定给明年的春节带来更大的欢乐！
