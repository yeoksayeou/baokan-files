    Comrade William Z. Foster, Glorious Warrior and Leader of the American Working Class

    Comrade William Z. Foster, Honorary Chairman of the Communist Party of the United States, is a glorious warrior and leader of the American working class. For a long time, Comrade Foster has waged unremitting struggles to win democratic freedom and defend the interests of the working class and working people, and has made great contributions.

    Comrade Foster was born on February 25, 1881, into a poor working-class family in Massachusetts. Due to economic difficulties, Comrade Foster had to leave school at the age of ten to work. In 1893, he participated in a strike for the first time. For twenty-six years, he worked in industries such as lumber, farms, railroads, hardware, and mines. Having personally seen and experienced the miserable situation and painful life of the broad masses of workers, Comrade Foster developed a class consciousness very early on to fight for the cause of the workers for the rest of his life, and actively participated in the socialist workers' movement.

    As early as 1909, Comrade Foster, together with activists from the "Industrial Workers of the World," conducted a vigorous and heroic struggle for freedom of speech in the northwestern United States. In 1917, the largest strike of meatpacking workers he led was victorious, and he led the meatpacking workers in the struggle to organize unions, making this industry the first large-scale production industry with a solid workers' organization. Therefore, Comrade Foster is a pioneer in the struggle to win the unity of the American labor movement. Later, Comrade Foster led the American workers' strike struggle many times and achieved great victories. The Great October Revolution inspired and encouraged Foster, who was wholeheartedly fighting for the cause of the working class and social progress. In 1920, he visited the Soviet Union and deeply studied the theory of Marxism-Leninism in Soviet life and practice. In early 1921, Comrade Foster joined the Communist Party of the United States and actively fought for the cause of the working class and the interests of all working people in the United States.

    When the deepest economic crisis broke out in 1929, the Communist Party under the leadership of Comrade Foster aroused the masses to fight for employment and for the implementation of unemployment insurance. In March 1930, Comrade Foster and his comrades led a large demonstration of more than 100,000 unemployed workers in New York. This demonstration inspired and encouraged a nationwide struggle to meet the demands of unemployed workers. Due to his outstanding leadership of this demonstration, Comrade Foster was arrested and sentenced to three years in prison. In 1948, Foster and his comrades were again arrested. In recent years, despite the US reactionary authorities' continuous and frantic persecution of the American people and the Communist Party of the United States, Comrade Foster and other leaders of the Communist Party of the United States have never stopped fighting for the interests of workers, for peace, for the rights of blacks, and for civil liberties.

    In order to defend the Marxist-Leninist purity of the Party and proletarian internationalist unity, Comrade Foster has consistently carried out sharp struggles against opportunism and revisionism that undermine the cause of the working class. Even before the establishment of the Communist Party of the United States, Comrade Foster led the left wing of the then Socialist Party in a struggle against opportunism. As a result of this struggle, he was expelled from the Socialist Party. He opposed sectarian elements in the workers' movement. At the same time, in the struggle against pure trade unionism and "economism," Comrade Foster showed himself to be an uncompromising warrior. Later, in the struggle against the opportunist Lovestone and the revisionist Browder and other traitors who usurped the position of party secretary at that time, Comrade Foster stood at the forefront of the struggle. In recent years, Comrade Foster and his comrades have led the Communist Party of the United States to fight under extremely difficult conditions, resolutely fought against the class enemies' suppression and sabotage conspiracies, purged the revisionist elements headed by Gates, defended the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and the international unity of the communist movement, thereby restoring and improving the combat effectiveness of the Communist Party of the United States, consolidating and strengthening party unity, and improving and strengthening the party's ties with the people. Encouraging progress has been made in terms of contact.

    Since joining the Communist Party of the United States in 1921, Comrade Foster has served as a member of the Party Central Committee, served as chairman of the Party three times, was the Party's presidential candidate in 1924, 1928 and 1932, and was the Party's candidate for Governor of New York State in 1930 and since 1921, he has dedicated himself to the work of the Party without interruption. In addition, for many years in the past, Comrade Foster also served as a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International and a member of the Executive Committee of the Red International of Labor Unions. In 1957, Comrade Foster was elected Honorary Chairman of the Communist Party of the United States. (Xinhua News Agency) (with picture)

    美国工人阶级光荣的战士和领袖
    威廉·福斯特同志
    美国共产党名誉主席威廉·福斯特同志是美国工人阶级光荣的战士和领袖。福斯特同志长期以来为了争取民主自由和保卫工人阶级和劳动人民的利益，始终进行着坚持不懈的斗争，并且作出了巨大的贡献。
    福斯特同志于1881年2月25日出生在马萨诸塞州一个贫苦的工人家庭里。由于经济困难，福斯特同志不得不在十岁时就离开学校做工去。在1893年，他第一次参加了罢工。有二十六年的时间，他在木材、农场、铁路、五金和矿井等行业做工。由于亲身看到和体验到了广大工人所处的悲惨境地和痛苦生活，福斯特同志很早就具有为工人事业而终身奋斗的阶级觉悟，并积极参加了社会主义工人运动。
    早在1909年，福斯特同志同
  “世界产业工人联合会”的积极分子一起在美国西北部进行了轰轰烈烈的争取言论自由的英勇斗争。1917年，他领导的屠宰业工人最大的一次罢工取得了胜利，他并领导了屠宰业工人进行了组织工会的斗争，使这个工业成为第一个具有巩固的工人组织的大规模生产的工业。因此，福斯特同志是争取美国劳工运动的团结的斗争中的先锋。以后，福斯特同志又多次领导了美国工人的罢工斗争，并取得巨大胜利。伟大十月革命激励和鼓舞了全心全意为工人阶级事业和社会进步而奋斗的福斯特。1920年他访问了苏联，深刻地研究了苏维埃的生活和实践中的马克思列宁主义的理论。1921年初，福斯特同志加入了美国共产党，为工人阶级事业和美国全体劳动人民的利益进行积极的斗争。
    当最深刻的经济危机在1929年爆发时，在福斯特同志领导下的共产党唤起群众，争取就业，争取实行失业保险制。1930年3月，福斯特同志和他的战友一起，领导了纽约十万多失业工人的大示威，这次示威激发和鼓舞了全国规模的争取满足失业工人要求的斗争。由于他出色地领导了这次示威，福斯特同志遭到逮捕，并被判处三年徒刑。1948年福斯特和他的战友又曾经遭到逮捕。近年来，尽管美国反动当局对美国人民和美国共产党不断地进行疯狂迫害，但是福斯特同志和美国共产党其他领袖继续为争取工人的利益、为和平、为黑人的权利和公民自由的斗争从来也没有停止过。
    福斯特同志为了保卫党的马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，和无产阶级国际主义团结，一贯对破坏工人阶级事业的机会主义和修正主义进行了尖锐的斗争。还在美国共产党成立之前，福斯特同志领导了当时社会党左翼进行了反对机会主义的斗争。由于这次斗争，他被社会党开除。他反对了工人运动中的宗派主义分子，同时在反对纯粹工会主义和“经济主义”的斗争中，福斯特同志都表现为一个绝不妥协的战士。以后在反对当时窃据党的书记的职务的机会主义分子洛夫斯顿和修正主义分子白劳德等叛徒的斗争中，福斯特同志都是站在斗争的最前列。近年来，福斯特同志又和他的战友一起，领导美国共产党在极为困难的条件下进行奋斗，同阶级敌人的镇压和破坏阴谋进行了坚决的斗争，清除了以盖茨为首的修正主义分子，捍卫了马克思列宁主义的基本原则和共产主义运动的国际团结，从而在恢复和提高美国共产党的战斗力、巩固和增强党的团结、改善和加强党同人民群众的联系等方面，获得了令人鼓舞的进展。
    福斯特同志从1921年参加美国共产党以来，就担任了党的中央委员，三度担任党的主席，1924、28和32年是党的总统候选人，1930年是党的纽约州州长候选人而且从1921年起，即献身于党的工作，毫未间断过。此外在过去许多年，福斯特同志还曾经担任共产国际执行委员和赤色工会国际执行委员。1957年福斯特同志被选为美国共产党名誉主席。　　　　（新华社）（附图片）
