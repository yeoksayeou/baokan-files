People Who Sacrifice Themselves for Others
Nai He

On January 14th, at 3:00 PM, the direct express train from Lanzhou to Shanghai steadily stopped at Zhengzhou as usual. At this time, two female comrades, both around twenty years old, happily boarded the train. These two female comrades were originally workers from the Zhengzhou No. 4 State-owned Cotton Mill. One of them, named Qian Xingdi, was a production team leader, now full-term pregnant and returning to her home in Changzhou to give birth; the other, named Chen Jinfeng, was an outstanding female worker from Qian Xingdi's team, who had taken leave to visit her home in Shanghai.

Due to the train's bumping, after the train left Kaifeng station, Qian Xingdi felt intermittent pains in her stomach, which later became more and more severe. Chen Jinfeng, who was traveling with her, was really panicked, and the passengers also gathered around, asking about her condition. The train conductor, after assessing Qian Xingdi's situation, immediately helped her to the sleeping car, had her lie down on the berth, covered her with a blanket, and hurriedly ran out of the carriage. After a while, an emergency announcement came from the loudspeaker: "Attention, passengers! There is a woman in labor. If there are any doctors or nurses on board, please hurry to the sleeping car! Quick! Quick!" Shortly after the broadcast, the carriage door suddenly opened, and the first to enter was a female comrade, a nurse from a hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department. She was already heavily pregnant and on leave, about to give birth herself. However, she did not consider this at all and immediately went to take care of the pregnant woman. Following her, a military doctor from the People's Liberation Army and a doctor in blue clothes also entered. The three of them calmly began the delivery. After a while, a "waa" sound announced the birth of a small life. Chen Jinfeng, who had been very worried and scared, was now very happy and shouted, "It's a boy! It's a boy!" This immediately caused a sensation throughout the carriage, and many comrades came to visit. Someone had already placed boiled eggs on the bedside of the mother, followed by more and more fruits, biscuits, candies, and other things. The train conductor was also busy getting water and pouring tea. At this time, the passengers throughout the carriage were happily discussing, "This is truly a joyous event on the train!"

Giving birth on the train, although with the care of doctors and comrades, was ultimately limited by various conditions. Because the mother lost too much blood, she had to get off the train midway. When the train arrived at Shangqiu Station, it was already after 8:00 PM. After contacting the station, the stationmaster immediately found five young and strong platform service staff members who carried a stretcher, covered with a new quilt, and immediately sent the mother and child from the train to the obstetrics and gynecology department of the city's People's Hospital.

After receiving this patient, Zhang Suxian, a female doctor nearly fifty years old, personally treated her, and the nurses quickly re-bandaged the baby and performed a blood test for the mother. After careful diagnosis, the doctor decided to give a blood transfusion. The lab technician interjected, "Her blood type is B." When Dr. Zhang heard "B type," she immediately rolled up her sleeves, stretched out her arm, and said to the nurses, "Come on! Quickly transfuse blood!" But the nurses were all stunned, never expecting the nearly half-century-old doctor to be so generous! "Quick! Saving lives is the most important thing!" Dr. Zhang urged the nurses. When everyone saw that it was impossible not to draw, they began to draw blood, stopping after drawing several tens of CCs. But Dr. Zhang would not allow it, and they only stopped after drawing one hundred CCs. When Dr. Zhang retracted her arm and stood up, she found that the head nurse, Li Shucheng, and nurses Li Guifu and Guo Lin, etc., were already lined up behind her, with their arms rolled up, ready to donate blood. Dr. Zhang smiled at them and said, "Great!"

After the blood transfusion, the doctors and nurses were still not at ease and stayed by the bedside to take care of her until 2:00 AM before going back to rest.

The next morning, this matter spread to the Baba People's Commune in the street. This commune had already contacted the hospital to prepare for the patient's urgent need for blood transfusions and had organized a blood donation team. Upon hearing this news, the commune secretary, Comrade Wang Guang'en, personally led ten young men and women to the hospital to request blood donation. After examination, three male comrades and two female comrades had matching blood types. They transfused 490 CCs of blood to the mother, which fundamentally reversed the critical condition and saved Qian Xingdi.

A few days later, the mother's husband, Ma Changfa, arrived at the hospital. He said excitedly, "The care of the Party and the government and the support of the people are unforgettable for life. Only by working hard in the future can I repay the care of the Party and the government and repay the great life-saving kindness of the people of the motherland."

    舍己为人的人们
    乃和
    1月14日，下午三时，兰州至上海的直达快车，像往常一样稳当地停在郑州。这时候有两个二十岁左右的女同志，高高兴兴地上了车。这两个女同志原来是郑州国棉四厂的女工。其中一个叫钱杏弟，是个生产组长，现在已怀孕足月，要回常州家里生孩子；另一个叫陈金凤，是钱杏弟小组的出色女工，今天是请假回上海探家。
    由于火车的颠簸，火车开出开封车站后，钱杏弟的肚子不时感到一阵阵的疼痛，以后，越来越剧烈，这时和她一路的陈金凤可真是慌了，旅客们也围上来问长问短。列车员看了看钱杏弟的情况，随即把她搀到卧铺车厢，让她躺在铺上，帮她盖好被子，慌忙跑出车厢。不一会，从喇叭里传出紧急的广播声：“喂！旅客同志们：现在有产妇，如果有医生或护士同志，请赶快到卧铺车厢！快！快！”广播后不久，车厢门忽一下就开了，第一个进来的是个女同志，她是一个医院妇产科的护士，一边脱衣服，一边挽袖子。可是她也是怀孕已久正在休假将要生产的人了。然而她毫没考虑这一点，马上就去照顾产妇。随着又进来一位解放军军医，还有一位穿蓝衣服的医生。他们三人不慌不忙地开始接生了。一会，哇的一声，一个小生命出世了。原来很担心害怕的陈金凤，这一下可高兴了，连声喊叫：“男孩！男孩！”顿时轰动了整个车厢，不少同志都前来看望，不知道是谁早已把煮熟的鸡蛋放到了产妇的床头，接着水果、饼干、糖等东西越来越多；列车员也忙着打水、倒茶。这时全车厢的旅客们都在高兴地谈论说：“这真是车厢里的喜事”！
  在列车上生孩子，虽有医生和同志们的照顾，但是毕竟要受到各方面条件的限制。因为产妇流血过多，不得不在中途下车。当列车来到商丘车站时，已经是晚上八点多了，和车站取得联系后，站长马上找了五个年轻力壮的站台服务员，抬着担架，铺着新被子，从火车上，连产妇带孩子，立即送到了市人民医院妇产科。
    妇产科接到了这个病人后，年近五十岁的女医生张素贤亲自动手治疗，护士们连忙重新包扎孩子，给产妇化验血。经过仔细诊断，医生决定输血。化验员忙插了一句：她的血是B型。张医生听到“B型”后，就马上挽起袖子，伸出胳臂，对护士说：“来！快输血！”可是护士们却都楞住了，没想到年近半百的老医生这样慷慨！“快！救人要紧！”张医生催促着护士。当大家看着不抽不行时，才开始抽血，抽了几十CC以后就停止了，可是张医生说啥也不允许，结果抽了一百CC才算完。当张医生蜷回胳臂，站起来的时候，才发现护士长李署成、护士李桂福和郭林等在她背后已排好队挽着胳臂准备输血。张医生对着她们笑了笑说：太好了！
    输血完后，医生和护士们还不放心，一直在床边照管着，直到深夜两点才回去休息。
    第二天上午，这件事情传到了街道八八人民公社，这个公社为了准备病人急需输血，早已和医院有联系，并且组织有输血队，当听到这个消息后，公社书记王广恩同志亲自领着十个男女青年来到医院要求输血，经检查有三个男同志和两个女同志血型相对；输给产妇四百九十CC血，这才基本上扭转了病情的危急，救好了钱杏弟。
    过了几天，产妇的爱人马长法赶到医院，他激动地说：“党和政府的关怀，人民群众的支持，使我终身难忘，只有在今后努力工作来报答党和政府的关怀；报答祖国人民的救命大恩。”
