    To Make Book Review Work a Regular Practice
    Cultural Publishing Bureau, Wang Cheng
    Book review is an important weapon for conducting ideological struggle, promoting creation, and conducting communist education for the people. However, in recent years, book reviews in newspapers and periodicals have not flourished. Now, the variety of books is increasing day by day, many excellent books have not been recommended to readers in a timely manner, and some bad books have not received the criticism they deserve.
    We hope that central-level newspapers and periodicals, especially the People's Daily, will give a certain amount of space to publish book review articles in a certain period, so as to ensure the regularity of book review work. Of course, it is impossible to ask them to review all books, but readers hope that they can report and comment on the most outstanding works of philosophy, social science, literature, science and technology, and popular readings through various forms, and frequently criticize books with erroneous ideological tendencies. This is of great significance for improving the ideological level of readers, authors and publishers. In addition, we hope that they will not only publish book reviews, but also comment on book reviews published in newspapers and periodicals across the country, comment on various issues in book reviews, so as to lead and promote book review work across the country.
    There are some problems in the current book review work that need to be solved. One of the main problems is that there are more reviews of literary works, fewer reviews of philosophy and social science works, and even fewer reviews of popular readings and science and technology books. This situation is not in line with the needs of educating the general public in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, publicizing the Party's policies, popularizing cultural and scientific knowledge, and national economic construction. To change this situation, it is not enough to rely on a few newspapers and periodicals; we must "walk on two legs." That is to say, readers require various professional and specific readers (such as children, women, etc.) oriented newspapers and periodicals, as well as newspapers and periodicals in various provinces and cities, to carry out book review work, commenting on their respective books and popular books published in various provinces and cities. In the past, some newspapers and periodicals, especially some science and technology publications, rarely commented on books related to themselves, which was not good.
    To carry out book review work, it is necessary to organize a book review team. At present, there are not many people writing book reviews. Some researchers are willing to write papers but not book reviews. In fact, book review work and research work are not opposed to each other, but promote each other. This needs to be promoted by comrades engaged in book review work. However, the members of the book review team, in addition to writers, researchers, editors of newspapers and periodicals and publishing houses, should also include comrades from Party committees at all levels, comrades who do practical work in business departments, and workers, peasants, and soldiers. We should organize them to write book reviews, so that experts and the masses are combined. This is not only a reliable source for expanding the book review team, but also because these comrades are closely linked to reality and the masses, and are directly engaged in political struggle and production practice, so the quality of the book reviews they write is higher. I think this is a fundamental issue in organizing the book review team, and it needs to be advocated.

    要使书评工作经常化
    文化部出版事业管理局　王成
    图书评论是进行思想斗争、繁荣创作和向人民进行共产主义教育的重要武器。但是，近年来报刊上的书评并不繁荣。现在，图书的品种与日俱增，许多优秀的图书没有及时向读者推荐，一些不好的图书也未能得到应有的批评。
    我们希望中央一级的报刊，特别是人民日报在一定时期给予一定的篇幅发表书评文章，这样才能保证书评工作的经常化。当然，要求他们评论所有的图书是不可能的，但是读者希望他们能通过各种形式，报道和评论哲学、社会科学、文学、科学技术和通俗读物中最优秀的著作，以及对于具有错误思想倾向的图书经常进行批评。这对于提高读者、作者和出版者的思想水平，具有重要的意义。此外，我们希望他们不但要发表书评，而且要对全国各报刊发表的书评进行评论，评论书评中的各种问题，从而领导和推动全国的书评工作。
    目前图书评论工作中存在一些问题，需要解决。主要的一个问题是：文艺作品的评论较多，哲学、社会科学著作的评论较少，特别是通俗读物和科学技术书籍的评论更少。这种状况与向广大读者进行马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的教育，宣传党的政策，普及文化科学知识，以及国家的经济建设的需要是不相适应的。要改变这种状况，只靠少数报刊是担负不了这个任务的，一定要“两条腿走路”。这就是说，读者要求各种专业性和以特定读者（如少年儿童、妇女等）为对象的报刊，以及各省市的报刊都开展书评工作，评论各自有关的图书和各省市出版的通俗图书。过去有些报刊，特别是一些科学技术刊物，很少评论与自己有关的图书，这是不好的。
    要开展书评工作，需要组织书评队伍，目前写书评的人不很多，一些研究工作者愿写论文而不愿写书评；其实书评工作与研究工作并不对立，而是互相促进的。这一点需要做书评工作的同志宣传。但是书评队伍的成员，除了作家、研究工作者、报刊和出版社的编辑以外，还要包括各级党委的同志、业务部门做实际工作的同志和工农群众，我们更要组织他们来写书评，使专家与群众相结合。这不仅是壮大书评队伍可靠的来源，而且因为这些同志密切联系实际和群众，直接从事政治斗争和生产实践，因而所写书评质量较高。我觉得这是组织书评队伍的一个带根本性的问题，需要倡导。
