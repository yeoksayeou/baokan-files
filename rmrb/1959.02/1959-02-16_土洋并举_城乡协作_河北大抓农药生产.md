Hebei Province, following the principle of utilizing both native and foreign methods, is vigorously promoting pesticide production.

This year, Hebei Province has fully mobilized the masses and organized cooperation between urban and rural areas to tap the potential for pesticide production from all aspects. The employees of dozens of pesticide factories in cities such as Tianjin and Tangshan are formulating plans to increase production to support a greater leap forward in agriculture this year. Local pesticide factories have successfully trial-produced 18 kinds of pesticides, including Dipterex and Gibberellin, and are starting to expand production. The employees of the Tianjin and Dagu chemical plants are researching the use of ineffective substances from certain pesticides to manufacture new pesticides such as trichlorobenzene. Many production units, adhering to the spirit of comprehensive utilization of raw materials, are fully utilizing waste gas, wastewater, and waste materials to produce pesticides. In Tianjin alone, there are 64 factories engaged in pesticide production as a side business.

According to recent statistics, there are already 2,228 pesticide factories established by counties and communes throughout the province. These pesticide factories, in addition to using local plant-based raw materials to produce dozens of kinds of native pesticides, are also using simple equipment and indigenous methods to produce mineral pesticides such as sodium fluoride and copper sulfate.

Commercial, educational, and scientific research departments in various regions are also supporting pesticide production from various aspects. The education departments in the Baoding area have assisted factories and communes in trial-producing more than 50 kinds of pesticides and chemical raw materials for formulating pesticides.

Hebei Province's experience in organizing pesticide production cooperation is as follows: First, rural and urban chemical pesticide factories sign agreements, with the rural areas supplying raw materials, and the factories giving priority to supplying the areas that supply raw materials with any surplus pesticide produced after fulfilling the state's tasks. Second, when counties and communes establish pesticide factories, urban pesticide factories provide assistance in technology and other aspects. Third, commercial departments regulate raw materials for pesticide factories and promote product sales. Fourth, educational and scientific research departments provide scientific knowledge and technology to support counties and communes in manufacturing pesticides. This has mobilized the enthusiasm of all parties in formulating pesticides. According to preliminary statistics from various regions and counties, this year's supply of various ores, alcohol, mirabilite, turpentine, and other raw materials to urban pesticide factories amounts to more than 32,000 tons. With sufficient raw materials, urban factories can fully utilize their production capacity. According to statistics from a dozen larger pesticide factories, due to the sufficient supply of raw materials this year, the production of pesticides such as 666 and DDT alone can increase by more than 10 million jin compared to the plan. Thanks to the support of all sectors in the cities, counties and communes have also rapidly established pesticide factories. In half a month, Longhua County built thirteen small sodium fluoride pesticide factories.

### 土洋并举　城乡协作  河北大抓农药生产

    土洋并举　城乡协作
    河北大抓农药生产
    本报天津15日电　河北省根据土洋并举的方针，正在大抓农药生产。
    今年，河北省充分地发动了群众，组织城乡各界互相协作，从各方面挖掘了农药的生产潜力。天津、唐山等城市的几十个农药厂的职工，正在制订增产计划，支援今年的农业更大跃进。各地农药厂已试制成功敌百虫、赤霉素等十八种农药，并着手扩大生产。天津、大沽两个化工厂的职工，正在研究利用某种农药的无效体制造三氯苯等新农药。许多生产单位，本着原料综合利用的精神，充分利用废气废水废料生产农药。仅天津市，兼搞农药生产的工厂就有六十四个。
    据最近统计，全省县、公社建立的农药厂，已有两千二百二十八处。这些农药厂，除利用当地植物性原料生产几十种土农药外，并用简易的设备和土办法，生产氟化钠，硫酸铜等矿物性的农药。
    各地商业、教育和科学研究部门，也从多方面支援农药生产。保定专区教育部门协助工厂、公社试制了五十多种农药和配制农药的化学原料。
    河北省组织农药生产协作的经验是：一、农村和城市的化工农药厂订立协议，由农村供应原料，工厂将完成国家任务后的超产农药，尽先供应供给原料的地区。二、县、公社建立农药厂时，城市农药工厂给予技术等各方面的协助。三、商业部门给农药厂调剂原料，推销产品。四、教育和科学研究部门提供科学知识和技术，支援县和公社制造农药。由此调动了各方面配制农药的积极性。根据各专区、县的初步统计，今年供应城市农药厂的各种矿石、酒精、芒硝、松节油等原料有三万二千多吨。城市工厂有了足够的原料，生产能力就能充分利用。据十几个较大农药厂的统计，由于今年原料充足，仅六六六、滴滴涕等农药，可比计划增产一千万多斤。由于得到城市各界的支援，县和公社也迅速建立了农药厂。隆化县在半个月当中，建起了十三座小型的氟化钠农药厂。
