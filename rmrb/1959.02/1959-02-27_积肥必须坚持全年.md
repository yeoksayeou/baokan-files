Short Commentary:

    The "Battle for Fertilizer" campaign has been underway for two months. This is a mass movement, vigorously launched under the leadership of the Party, with great momentum and brilliant results. The amount of fertilizer accumulated during this period, both in terms of quantity and quality, far exceeds that of previous years. For example, in Fujian Province, three million people fought for a month, and by February 13, statistics showed that they had accumulated more than 7 billion dan of various farmyard manures and produced more than 1.26 billion jin of indigenous chemical fertilizers and mixed fertilizers. In Beijing, by February 13, 62.6 billion jin of various fertilizers had been accumulated, averaging more than 13,400 jin of fertilizer per mu of spring-sown land; a total of more than 460 million jin of indigenous chemical fertilizers, bacterial fertilizers, and granular fertilizers were produced, averaging 74 jin per mu. The fertilizer accumulation situation in other regions is similar to that of Fujian and Beijing. Through this battle, most regions have prepared a large amount of topdressing for summer-harvested crops such as wheat and rapeseed, and a certain amount of base fertilizer for spring-sown crops.

    So, can the fertilizer accumulation work be concluded? Absolutely not. Crops need to absorb fertilizer throughout their entire growth process; moreover, in addition to meeting the needs of summer-harvested and spring-sown crops, sufficient preparations must be made for summer-sown and autumn-sown crops. In order to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production this year, and to ensure the completion and over-completion of grain and cotton targets, the battle for fertilizer must continue. In areas with earlier farming seasons and more fertilizer accumulation, on the one hand, this battle must be carried out to the end, and the accumulated fertilizer must be transported to the fields and applied in a timely manner; on the other hand, labor should be appropriately adjusted to transform the all-out effort into a regular practice. In areas with later farming seasons and where the need for fertilizer and increased production is still far from being met, sufficient effort should be made to launch another concentrated campaign for a period of time, and it is imperative not to withdraw troops hastily.

    Fertilizer accumulation is originally a regular task. Manure, ashes, garbage, etc., should be accumulated at any time; composting with weeds, leaves, and crop stalks can be carried out throughout the year; indigenous chemical fertilizers, bacterial fertilizers, granular fertilizers, etc., can be produced every day as long as there is equipment and raw materials. If we usually grasp the source of fertilizer and accumulate and manufacture fertilizer regularly, and do not let go of any small source of fertilizer, we can accumulate a lot from a little. However, because the regular accumulation of fertilizer involves fewer people and the accumulation process is longer, it will be difficult to meet the large and urgent demand for fertilizer by crops. The use of agricultural labor should be adapted to the seasons, and fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing (especially composting with weeds and cultivating green manure) also have a strong seasonality. Therefore, in addition to regular fertilizer accumulation, it is also necessary to launch several concentrated fertilizer accumulation campaigns at appropriate times each year. Only in this way, by combining concentrated fertilizer accumulation and regular fertilizer accumulation, can the fertilizer problem be solved more, faster, better, and more economically.

    At present, we must not only greatly strengthen the field management of summer-harvested crops such as wheat and rapeseed, but also firmly grasp the preparation for spring plowing and spring sowing, as well as vigorously engage in spring afforestation, livestock breeding, and other tasks. In areas where decisive victories have been achieved in fertilizer accumulation, we should adapt to the new situation and quickly make appropriate adjustments to labor. The regular fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing work can be entrusted to specialized fertilizer teams, and more labor can be used for field management and spring plowing and spring sowing. At an appropriate time, another concentrated fertilizer accumulation campaign will be launched. By complementing each other in this way and persevering throughout the year, there will be a reliable guarantee for the fertilizer needed for a bumper harvest throughout the year.

### 积肥必须坚持全年

    积肥必须坚持全年
    “为肥而战”的突击运动，已经开展了两个来月。这是在党的领导下大张旗鼓地开展起来的一次群众运动，声势浩大，战果辉煌。在这期间所积的肥料，不论从数量和质量来说，都大大超过了往年。像福建省，三百万人奋战了一月，到2月13日统计，就积了各种农家肥七十亿担以上，制造了土化肥、混合肥十二亿六千多万斤。北京市到2月13日止，已积各种肥料六百二十六亿斤，平均每亩春播地有肥料一万三千四百多斤；共制造出土化肥、细菌肥、颗粒肥四亿六千多万斤，平均每亩七十四斤。其他地区的积肥情况和福建、北京相类似。经过这次战斗，大部分地区为小麦、油菜等夏收作物准备了大量追肥，为春播作物准备下一定的基肥。
    那末，积肥工作是不是已经可以收场了呢？决不能这么做。作物在整个生长过程中都需要吸收肥份；再说，除了适应夏收作物和春播作物的需要以外，还要为夏播作物、秋播作物作充分的准备。为了实现今年农业生产的更大更好更全面的跃进，保证粮棉指标的完成和超额完成，积肥的战斗还须继续进行。在农事季节较早和积肥较多的地区，一方面，要把这一次战斗进行到底，把所积的肥料及时运到地里施下去；另一方面，要适当调整劳动力，把突击转为经常。在农事季节较迟和肥料同增产的需要仍然相差太远的地区，还要用足够的力量再突击一个时期，决不可草率收兵。
    积肥，本来是经常性的工作，像人畜粪便、草木灰、垃圾等，都应当随时积攒；用杂草、树叶、作物秸秆堆肥沤肥，一年四季都可以进行；土化肥、细菌肥、颗粒肥等，只要有了设备和原料，更可以天天生产。如果平时抓紧肥源经常积肥造肥，对零星的肥源也不放过，就可以积少成多。不过，由于经常积肥动员的人力较少，积攒的过程又较长，一旦遇到作物需肥数量大而时间又很紧迫的时候，就会感到困难。农业劳动力的使用要适应季节，积肥造肥（特别是用杂草沤肥和培育绿肥）也有强烈的季节性。因此，除了经常性的积肥以外，每年还要选择适当时机开展几次突击性的积肥运动，只有这样，把突击积肥造肥和经常积肥造肥结合起来，才能多快好省地解决肥料问题。
    目前，既要大大加强小麦、油菜等夏收作物的田间管理，又要紧紧抓住春耕准备和春耕春播工作，还要大搞春季造林、牲畜配种等等工作。在积肥已经取得决定性的胜利的地区，应该适应新的情况，赶紧把劳动力再作适当的调整。可以把经常性的积肥造肥工作交由肥料专业队负责，把更多的劳动力用在田间管理和春耕春播方面。到适当的时机，再开展突击积肥运动。这样相辅而行，常年坚持下去，争取全年大丰收所需的肥料就有了可靠的保证。
