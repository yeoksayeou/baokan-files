Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 9th: The workers of Shanghai Jianhua Electrical Instrument Factory are determined to break with convention and transform a low-output month into a high-output month. The factory's January production was 3.6% higher than December of last year, which was the highest of the year, and they aim to exceed January's level in February.

Whether high output could be achieved in February was something that a few people in the factory had doubts about. According to usual practice, February has six fewer production days than January, so output is generally lower. In late January, when the factory mobilized all employees to discuss the February plan, most workers believed that although the January production plan was overfulfilled, there was still potential to be tapped. For example, the proportion of manual operations throughout the factory was high, coordination with other factories was not tight enough, and production was not balanced between different types of work. If these problems were solved, February's output could completely exceed January's.

After setting the high-output targets for February, all the factory's employees launched a technical revolution movement, fiercely attacking weak links. In the first five days of February, the workers have already created twenty-three new records. Punch press workers improved nine types of molds, increasing the production efficiency of nine types of parts by one to three times respectively. Two apprentices in the metalworking workshop, when processing iron cores, increased their daily output from over two thousand to over three thousand due to prior preparation.

The production of a type of pivot previously relied on external factory supply, which was not very timely. This time, the workers relied on their own efforts to manufacture indigenous equipment for self-processing. In just five days, they manufactured two semi-automatic pivot grinding machines, solving a key problem in February's production. The meter core assembly process in the assembly workshop was also a weak link. The workers also made a type of frame for assembling meter cores, which can greatly improve work efficiency.

In the first six days of February, the instruments produced by this factory were equivalent to ten times the output of the same period in January, changing the past situation of not producing or producing very few instruments at the beginning of the month.

    上海建华电工仪表厂大搞技术革命
    二月产量要比一月高
    新华社上海9日电　上海建华电工仪表厂职工决心打破常规，变低产月为高产月。这个厂1月份生产比去年最高的12月份高3.6％，2月份还要超过1月份的水平。
    2月份能否高产，这个厂的少数人也曾经有过怀疑。因为，按照常例，2月份比1月份要少生产六天，产量一般都比1月低。1月下旬，工厂发动全体职工讨论2月份计划的时候，大部分职工认为：1月份生产计划虽然超额完成，但是还有潜力可挖，如全厂手工操作比重大，和外厂协作衔接得不够紧凑，工种和工种之间生产还不平衡等，同时，月初抓得也不紧。如果解决了这些问题，2月份的产量完全可以超过1月份。
    在订出2月份的高产指标以后，全厂职工就开展技术革命运动，猛攻薄弱环节。2月份头五天里，职工们已经连续创造二十三个新纪录。冲床工人改进了九种模具，使九种零件的生产效率分别提高一倍到三倍。金工车间的两个徒工在加工铁蕊时，由于事先做好准备工作，班产量从二千多只提高到三千多只。
    这个工厂生产的一种轴尖，过去靠外厂供应，不很及时，这次职工们自力更生，制造土设备，自己加工，只花了五天时间，就制造成两台半自动的磨轴尖的设备，解决了2月份生产中的关键问题。装配车间装表蕊的工序也是个薄弱环节，工人们也制成了一种装表蕊的架子，可以使工作效率大大提高。
    在2月份的头六天中，这个厂生产的仪表相当于1月同期的十倍，改变了过去月初不出或很少出仪表的情况。
