Gansu Promotes Large-Scale Accumulation of Farm Manure and Indigenous Fertilizer
Lanzhou's Provincial and Municipal机关干部 Brave Snow to Mobilize Fertilizer Accumulation

(Our newspaper's Lanzhou dispatch, 3rd) Gansu Province has adopted a method of simultaneously promoting farm manure and indigenous fertilizer, greatly accelerating fertilizer accumulation. According to statistics up to January 27th, the total amount of fertilizer accumulated in the province has reached 69% of this year's total fertilizer requirement. Compared with last year's average fertilizer application per mu of farmland, this year's application has increased by more than two times. Currently, the fertilizer accumulation army in various regions is advancing victoriously.

During the fertilizer accumulation campaign, in addition to mobilizing the masses to accumulate fertilizer, various regions have also actively strengthened specialized fertilizer accumulation teams. The Pingliang Special District transferred more than 160,000 laborers from water conservancy projects to the fertilizer accumulation campaign. In the Zhangye Special District, the labor force for fertilizer accumulation increased from 20% of the total labor force to 35%, with some counties reaching 50%. The Dingxi Special District organized 500,000 people to participate in the specialized fertilizer accumulation teams. As a result, the province's fertilizer accumulation army has increased sharply from hundreds of thousands of people in the past to 1.27 million people. Various regions have also vigorously promoted twelve fertilizer accumulation methods, including smoking, burning, exchanging, sweeping, shoveling, picking up, filling, composting, pressing, planting, creating, and digging, to broaden fertilizer accumulation channels and accelerate fertilizer accumulation progress. Ning County launched a mass campaign of smoking fertilizer with thousands of pagodas and tens of thousands of pagodas. On the plains stretching 250 li, large and small pagodas formed groups, and green smoke formed clouds.

According to the fertilizer accumulation method of walking on two legs, namely farm manure and indigenous fertilizer, various regions have vigorously established indigenous fertilizer plants to manufacture indigenous fertilizer. By the end of January, the province had established more than 180,000 indigenous fertilizer plants, producing more than 19 billion jin of various indigenous fertilizers.

In order to transport the accumulated fertilizers to the fields in a timely manner, various regions have also launched a high tide of tool reform centered on reforming transportation tools. According to incomplete statistics, the province has manufactured more than 170,000 transportation vehicles in conjunction with fertilizer transportation.

    兰州市的省市级机关干部冒雪出动积肥
    本报兰州3日电　甘肃省采用农家肥、土化肥一齐上马的办法，积肥速度已经大大加快。到1月27日统计，全省积肥总数已占今年需肥总量的69％，和去年平均每亩农田施肥量相比，今年每亩农田已增加了两倍以上。目前，各地的积肥大军正乘胜前进。
    在积肥运动中，各地除发动群众人人动手积肥以外，还积极加强了积肥专业队伍。平凉专区从水利工程上抽调了十六万多个劳力投入了积肥运动；张掖专区积肥的劳力由原来占总劳力的20％增加到35％，有的县达到50％；定西专区组织了五十万人参加积肥专业队伍。因此，全省的积肥大军已由过去的几十万人猛增到一百二十七万人。各地还大力推广了熏、烧、换、扫、铲、拾、填、沤、压、种、造、挖等十二种积肥方法，广开积肥门路，加快积肥进度。宁县展开了群众性的千塔万塔熏肥运动，在长达二百五十华里的平原上，大塔小塔成群，青烟成云。
    各地根据农家肥、土化肥两条腿走路的积肥办法，大办土化肥厂，制造土化肥。到1月底止，全省已建立了十八万多个土化肥厂，生产了各种土化肥一百九十多亿斤。
    为了把已积好的各种肥料及时运到田里，各地还掀起了以改革运输工具为中心的工具改革高潮。据不完全统计，全省结合运肥已制造了运输车辆十七万多辆。
