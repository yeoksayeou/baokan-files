    Water Flowing Through Yanji Must All Be Put to Work
    Yanji County People's Committee
    There are more than 1,500 rivers and streams of various sizes within Yanji County, Jilin Province. The Tumen River, Hailan River, Burhatong River, and Chaoyang River crisscross the land. The riverbeds are relatively steep, water volume is abundant, and the water flow is rapid, making for excellent water conservancy and hydropower conditions.

    Before 1957, the masses in remote areas of our county spontaneously established more than 40 small hydropower stations and hydrokinetic power stations. In 1958, we implemented the policy of prioritizing production, small-scale operations, and community-run initiatives. Under the unified leadership of the Party, as of now, the county has established a total of 24 small power stations (two of which are thermal power stations), 237 hydrokinetic power stations, and three hydraulic pumping stations.

    The working efficiency of hydraulic threshing machines is six to seven times higher than that of human-powered pedal threshing machines, saving the county 196,000 workdays. The county's 25 hydraulic rice mills save a total of 47,300 man-days and more than 27,000 animal-days. In the Taoyuan Work Area of Laotougou Town, the use of water power to drive five Liberation-style waterwheels irrigates six hectares of paddy fields, increasing grain production by more than 50,000 catties per year. From the implementation effects of the above-mentioned hydrokinetic power stations, it can be seen that labor has been greatly saved, and at the same time, a preliminary foundation has been laid for Yanji County to move towards mechanization in the future.

    The following are some of our experiences in utilizing water energy as a power source:

    First, in leading the construction of hydrokinetic power, the secretary must take action. The county party secretary personally serves as the director of the tool reform committee, clarifying that the task of building stations is to serve agricultural production and promote the experience of building stations. Previously, many cadres and masses believed that stations could not be built if the drop was less than 1.5 meters, or if there was no cement. The leadership criticized this conservative thinking, mobilized the masses, and carried out a vigorous technical revolution. In fact, impact turbines can be installed with a drop of 0.5 meters, and dry-laid rubble can be used for all civil engineering projects. Through training, 150 technicians and electricians were cultivated as the backbone of construction, and the "five selfs" were implemented in the construction process, namely: self-design, self-construction, self-installation, self-management, and self-repair.

    Second, earnestly rely on the masses and give full play to the wisdom of the masses. The first difficulty encountered in building the stations was the shortage of equipment, the lack of round steel (axles), belts, wood, and ball bearings. At this time, some people wanted to wait for state assistance, but after the masses were mobilized, they used materials such as board sticks for wood to make water turbines, and used foreign well pipes to replace round steel (turbine shafts), thus solving the lack of equipment and building most of the power stations.

    Third, adapt to local conditions, use local materials, and make do with whatever is available. From the current construction of hydrokinetic power stations in our county, most of the power stations have been built by using the original channels and the drop of buildings to install wooden water turbines, because the "three main" principles were implemented. In this way, the equipment is simple, the technology is easily mastered by the masses, it costs little money (only about 100 yuan per station), and the results are quick. On the other hand, our county belongs to a mountainous area with many gullies, making it easy to obtain water heads, and there is no shortage of wood and stone, which provides favorable conditions for the establishment of hydrokinetic power stations.

    水从延吉过　都要给干活
    延吉县人民委员会
    吉林省延吉县境内有大小河流一千五百多条，图们江、海兰河、布尔哈通河、朝阳河，纵横串流，河床较陡，水量丰富，水流湍急，水利水能条件优越。
    1957年前，我县偏僻地区的群众，自发地建立四十多处水电站和水能动力站。1958年我们贯彻以生产为主、小型为主、社办为主的方针，在党的统一领导下，截至目前全县共建立小型电站二十四处（其中二处是火力发电），水动力站二百三十七处，另外有三处水力抽水站。
    利用水力脱谷机的工作效率比人脚踏脱谷机要提高六至七倍，全县因此节省十九万六千个工日。全县二十五台水力碾米机共省四万七千三百个人工，畜力二万七千多个工。老头沟镇桃源作业区，利用水力带动五台解放式水车，抽水灌溉六垧水田，年增产粮食五万多斤。从上述水动力站的实施效果看来，大大的节省了劳动力，同时给延吉县今后走向机械化打下了初步基础。
    以下是我们利用水能为动力工作中的几点体会：
    第一，在领导水动力化的建设中，必须由书记动手。县委书记亲自担任工具改革委员会主任。明确建站任务服务于农业生产，推广建站经验。以前许多干部和群众认为，落差不到一点五公尺，不能建站，没有水泥不能建站。领导上批判了这种保守思想，发动群众，大闹技术革命，事实在落差零点五公尺就可以安装冲击式水轮机，土建工程全都可用干砌块石。通过训练培养一百五十名技工、电工，做为建设的骨干力量，并在建站过程贯彻了“五自”即自己设计、自己施工、自己安装、自己管理、自己修理。
    第二，认真依靠群众，充分发挥群众智慧。在建站中首先遇到的困难是器材不足，缺乏圆钢（轮轴）、皮带、木材、滚珠。这时有人想等待国家援助，但是群众发动起来后，他们利用板杖子等木材做水轮机，利用洋井管代替圆钢（水轮机轴）就这样解决了缺乏器材，把大部分的动力站建立起来。
    第三，因地制宜，就地取材，因陋就简。从我县目前的水动力站建设情况来看，因为贯彻了“三主”方针，大部分动力站就是利用原有渠道和建筑物的落差，安装了木制水轮机建成的。这样设备简单，技术容易为群众所掌握，花钱少（一个站仅花一百元左右），收效快。另一方面我县属山区，沟谷比较多，容易取得水头，木材、石头都不缺，这些都提供了建立水动力站的有利条件。
