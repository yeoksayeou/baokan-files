Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 15th: By fully estimating and utilizing the favorable situation in grain production and boosting morale, Guangdong Province is determined to increase grain production by more than 60% this year, on the basis of doubling production last year compared to the year before.

This decision was made by the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) at a meeting of its Standing Committee on February 3, after repeated studies in the past one to two months. At a telephone conference held on the evening of the 4th, attended by the First Secretaries of the Hainan District Committee, the Guangzhou Municipal Committee, and various Prefectural and County Committees, the decision was unanimously and firmly supported by the secretaries of the district, city, prefectural, and county committees. This decision will also be presented at the Provincial Party Congress to be held on the 16th to mobilize the entire Party and the people to ensure the completion and strive for the overfulfillment of the task.

The Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee analyzed that the confidence in high-speed grain production fostered by the Party and the masses in the practice of implementing the Party Central Committee's "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture during last year's Great Leap Forward and bumper harvest, as well as the soaring enthusiasm further stimulated on this basis, are the most active and decisive factors in the favorable situation of grain production this year. In the past year, the Party and the masses experienced a tremendous leap in learning and mastering the objective laws of grain production. The secret of high-speed grain production has been revealed, and the experience of high-speed grain production has been basically grasped by the Party and the masses. As a result, what was previously unimaginable has now suddenly become a reality, and what was previously impossible has now been achieved. In Guangdong Province's grain production, there were only a few "thousand-jin counties" the year before last. Last year, most of the one hundred and eight counties became "thousand-jin counties," and a few became "eight-hundred-jin counties"; only a few counties produced less than eight hundred jin. These "thousand-jin counties" and "eight-hundred-jin counties" include some counties with barren land and backward farming practices, where annual grain production had never exceeded three hundred jin. In the province as a whole, last year the province not only achieved the "eight-hundred-jin province," originally planned for 1962, ahead of schedule, but also greatly crossed the "thousand-jin province" threshold. However, last year's extraordinary grain harvest was achieved because the early rice crop was not outstanding enough, but in the second half of the year, under the slogan of "reclaiming the upstream," we boosted our morale and liberated our thinking to achieve the leap forward. The effort to secure a bumper late rice harvest last year also began without sufficient preparation, and the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agricultural production was not implemented comprehensively enough. We focused on the three characters of "water, density, and management," but we grasped "density" somewhat late, and the other five characters were not grasped well enough. Even so, we still achieved an unimaginable Great Leap Forward last year. This is something that the vast number of cadres and the people have personally experienced. Through these practices, people clearly see that grain production does have great potential, and that increasing grain production at high speed is not as difficult as originally imagined. Therefore, as long as we start early this year, mobilize the masses more deeply, boost our morale, and comprehensively and thoroughly implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, and fully utilize the objectively existing potential of grain production, it is entirely possible to increase the yield of each crop by more than 60% compared to last year.

The Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee also emphasized the favorable situation after the people's communes were established. This favorable situation is not only manifested in the more rational and effective use of manpower and resources through unified allocation, the greater support of commune-run industries for grain production, and the liberation of women's labor force after the collectivization of life, but more importantly, due to last year's extraordinary harvest and the realization of communization, the lives of the peasants have been further guaranteed and improved. The vast number of peasants, who have not been able to escape poverty for a long time, have a strong desire to improve their lives. Since liberation, their lives have been getting better year by year, but the improvement has not been enough. Now, they have seen the fruitful results brought to them by a year of hard work and communization, and their enthusiasm for production has therefore been unprecedentedly enhanced.

The good situation of early rice preparation this year also illustrates that the situation of grain production this year is far from comparable to previous years. According to inspection, each item in the "Eight-Character Constitution" has been implemented as much as possible, and quite resolutely, according to the seasons. The preparatory work for the 23 million mu of early rice and 3 million mu of medium rice, which are important for the completion of this year's grain task, has been done quite well. In terms of water conservancy, we are now able to avoid general floods and have the ability to resist drought for more than three months. Last year, early and late rice fields generally had only two months of drought resistance. In terms of deep plowing, 18 million mu have been deeply plowed to about one foot. Last year, early rice land was only plowed three or four inches, and late rice land was plowed four or five inches. In terms of fertilizer, more than 20 billion dan of fertilizer were accumulated for the 34 million mu of late rice fields last year, and more than 30 billion dan of fertilizer have been accumulated for the 26 million mu of early and medium rice fields this year, and large-scale fertilizer accumulation is still in progress. In terms of close planting, seeds have been prepared according to 600,000 to 800,000 seedlings per mu, and most of them have been replaced with improved varieties.

The Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee pointed out that, according to the experience of the large-scale high-yield fields of several thousand mu and tens of thousands of mu of late rice last year, the basic conditions for a yield of 2,000 jin per mu of rice in one season are: (1) no drought or flood, (2) more than 1,000 dan of good fertilizer, (3) no less than 600,000 seedlings planted per mu, (4) no early lodging, (5) no serious pests and diseases. With these five conditions, it is entirely possible to get a yield of 2,000 jin per mu. The Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee believes that, judging from these five requirements, if there are no particularly large natural disasters, all 26 million mu of early and medium rice this year can achieve this, so it is entirely possible to harvest about 2,000 jin or more per mu.

The Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee also pointed out that there will be difficulties in ensuring the completion of this year's grain production task. For example, high yields require intensive cultivation and more labor input, but various undertakings are leaping forward at the same time this year, and the labor force is extremely scarce, which is a considerable difficulty. However, as long as we strengthen the Party's leadership, launch a vigorous mass movement, and rely on the soaring enthusiasm of the people, overcoming difficulties is no problem. To this end, the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee decided that the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee will focus on agriculture with his main energy in the first half of this year while implementing the policy of simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture; the First Secretaries of the Prefectural and County Party Committees will focus on agriculture with their main energy throughout this year while implementing the policy of simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture. Resolutely transfer a large number of leading cadres to lower levels, go deep into reality, strengthen leadership and participate in labor. The Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and the Secretaries of the Prefectural Party Committees will take the lead in going down to the counties, the County Party Committee Secretaries will transfer a group to the Commune Party Committees, and the Commune Party Committee Secretaries will transfer a group to the Management Districts, and so on, all the way down. Immediately transfer more than 600 cadres at the department, hall, bureau, division, and section levels from the provincial directly subordinate organs to the communes to participate in labor and be peasants for a month. All rural work cadres, without exception, must take off their shoes and go down to the fields, and take the lead in hard work with the peasants. In agricultural production, give priority to grain, first arrange grain production. This year, the labor force used by each commune for early and late crops must be guaranteed to be 50% to 60% engaged in grain production on a regular basis. We must fully use the successful experience of last year's mass movement, adhere to cadres taking the lead in hard work, planting experimental fields, leading production with production, caring for the lives of the masses, and using methods such as great airing of views, great debates, great inspections, great appraisals, and great competitions to fully mobilize the masses and launch a fierce production movement according to the requirements of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, and complete combat tasks one after another.

The Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee reminded all localities that we must attach importance to difficulties in tactics and do our work conscientiously, practically, and meticulously for this year's greater leap forward. However, we must despise difficulties strategically, continue to oppose conservatism, boost our morale, and strive for the upstream. We must never let our thinking lag behind the objective situation. At present, some places do not adequately affirm the great achievements and experience of last year's grain production, do not adequately estimate the situation of this year's Great Leap Forward in grain production, see and talk about difficulties too much, and show a lack of confidence and small steps in leading this year's greater, better, and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward. This is completely wrong. (Attached picture)

    抓住有利形势　激发冲天干劲　发扬扎实作风　贯彻八字宪法 
    广东决心高速度增产粮食
    在去年增产一倍的基础上今年力争再增六成多
    新华社广州15日电　充分估计和利用粮食生产的有利形势，鼓足干劲，广东省今年决心要粮食在去年比前年增产一倍的基础上再增加六成多。
    这一项决定，是中共广东省委在最近一、二个月内经过反复研究之后，于2月3日召开的常委会议上决定的。在4日晚召开的海南区党委、广州市委和各地委、县委第一书记参加的电话会议上，又得到各区、市、地、县委书记一致坚决拥护。这一项决定还将拿到16日召开的省党代表大会上讨论，动员全党全民保证完成并争取超额完成。
    中共广东省委常委会分析说，党和群众从去年农业大跃进大丰收中，在贯彻执行党中央的农业“八字宪法”的实践中培养起来的那种对于高速度增产粮食的信心，以及在这基础上进一步激发起来的冲天干劲，是今年粮食生产有利形势中最活跃的、最具有决定性的因素。去年一年，党和群众在学习和掌握粮食生产的客观规律方面，经历了一个巨大的飞跃。高速度增产粮食的秘密已经揭开了，高速度增产粮食的经验基本上已被党和群众所掌握了。这样一来，过去想都不敢想的，现在一下子变为事实，过去不敢办的，现在办到了。广东省粮食生产上，前年还只有几个千斤县，去年一百零八个县中，大都成了千斤县，少数成为八百斤县；八百斤以下的县只是个别的了。这些千斤县和八百斤县中，包括一些土地贫瘠、耕作一向落后，年产粮食一直突不破三百斤的县份。就全省说，去年全省粮食不仅提前实现原来确定在1962年才能达到的八百斤省，而且还大大地跨过了千斤省的界线。但是去年的粮食特大丰收，是在早造不够突出，主要是下半年在“重夺上游”的口号下，鼓足干劲，解放思想，才跃进上去的。去年争取晚稻丰收也是在准备并不很充分的情况下开始的，对农业增产“八字宪法”执行得不够全面，着重地抓了水、密、管三个字，但对密抓得晚了些，对其余五个字也抓得不够好。即使这样，去年仍取得了人们想像不到的大跃进。这是广大干部和人民群众都亲身实践过的。通过这些实践，人们清楚地看到，粮食生产确实有极大潜力，而粮食高速度地增产也并不像原来设想的那么困难。因此，今年只要及早动手，更深入的发动群众，鼓足干劲，全面地彻底地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，充分利用客观存在的粮食生产的潜力，那么，今年每造粮食产量再比去年增产六成以上便是完全可能的。
    中共广东省委常委会还强调地指出了人民公社化以后的有利形势。这种有利形势不仅表现在人力、资源因统一调度，将得到更合理更有效地使用，社办工业对粮食生产将会有更大的支持，生活集体化后妇女劳动力的解放等等，更重要的是，由于去年特大丰收和实现公社化后，农民群众的生活得到更大的保障，得到更多地改善。长期以来还未能够摆脱贫困的广大农民，有着强烈的改善生活的愿望，解放以来，他们的日子一年比一年好过了，但是生活改善得还不够。现在，他们看到了一年苦战和公社化所带给他们的丰硕果实，因此生产积极性空前地提高了。
    今年早造备耕的良好情况，也正好说明今年粮食生产的形势远非往年所能比拟。据检查，“八字宪法”中的各条，按节令能办的都尽力办了，办得相当坚决。对完成今年粮食任务有重要关系的二千三百万亩早稻和三百万亩中稻的备耕工作，做得相当出色。水利方面，已能够避免一般涝灾，具有三个月以上抗旱能力，去年早、晚造稻田一般只有两个月抗旱能力。深翻方面，有一千八百万亩深耕一尺左右；去年早稻地只耕三、四寸，晚稻地耕四、五寸。肥料方面，去年三千四百万亩晚稻田积了肥料二百多亿担，今年二千六百万亩早、中稻田已积肥三百多亿担，大规模的积肥还在进行。密植方面，已按照每亩插六十万穗到八十万穗准备了种子，并且大部已换为良种。
    中共广东省委常委会指出，根据去年几千亩、几万亩晚稻大面积丰产田的经验，一造水稻亩产二千斤的基本条件是：（1）不受旱涝，（2）一千担以上好肥料，（3）每亩插秧不少于六十万穗，（4）不发生早期倒伏，（5）不发生严重病虫害。有了这五条，亩产两千斤是完全有把握拿得到的。省委常委会认为，就这五条要求看，如果不遇特大自然灾害，今年二千六百万亩早、中稻全能做到，因此每亩收到二千斤左右或二千斤以上是完全可能的。
    中共广东省委常委会也指出，要保证完成今年粮食生产任务不会没有困难，例如，高产要求精耕细作，投放更多劳力，而今年各种事业齐头跃进，劳动力极感缺乏，这就是一个不小的困难。但是只要加强党的领导，搞起一个轰轰烈烈的群众运动，依靠人民群众的冲天干劲，克服困难就不在话下。为此，省委常委会决定：省委第一书记今年上半年在贯彻执行工业农业同时并举的方针下，以主要精力抓农业；地委、县委第一书记今年全年内在贯彻执行工业农业同时并举的方针下，以主要精力抓农业。坚决抽调大批领导干部下放，深入实际，加强领导和参加劳动，省委书记和地委书记带头下放到县，县委书记抽一批下放到公社党委，公社党委书记抽一批下放到管理区，如此类推，一贯到底。从省直属机关立即抽调部、厅、局、处、科级干部六百人以上，下放到公社去参加劳动当一个月农民。所有农村工作干部无例外地脱鞋子下田，和农民一起带头苦战。农业生产上增调粮食挂帅，首先安排粮食生产，今年各个公社用于早、晚两造作物上的劳动力，必须保证经常有50％至60％从事粮食生产。要充分运用去年大搞群众运动的成功经验，坚持干部带头苦战，种试验田，以生产领导生产，关心群众生活，以及运用大鸣大放大辩论，大检查、大评比、大竞赛等方式方法，来充分地发动广大群众，根据农业“八字宪法”的要求，掀起猛烈的生产运动，把战斗任务一个接着一个地完满完成。
    中共广东省委常委会提醒各地说，我们在战术上要重视困难，对今年的更大跃进必须兢兢业业、扎实细致地做好工作。但是，我们必须在战略上藐视困难，必须继续反对保守，鼓足干劲，力争上游，决不要让自己的思想落后于客观形势。目前有些地方，对去年粮食生产的巨大成绩和经验肯定不足，对今年粮食生产大跃进的形势估计不够，看困难和讲困难多了一点，对领导今年更大更好更全面的大跃进，表现出信心不坚，小手小脚，这是完全不应该的。（附图片）
