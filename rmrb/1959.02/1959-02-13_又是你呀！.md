    “It’s You Again!”
    Liu Zhaorong, Xinmin County, Liaoning Province
    After dinner, Li Fugeng, an old man from the home for the elderly, sat on the kang, weaving a basket. He said to his old friends around him with a touch of pride:
    "Hmm, if they don't give me a basket, I can still weave one myself. Heh!"
    One warm afternoon, he was strolling down the street. He saw a tall man walking towards him, wearing a blue cadre uniform, a dogskin hat, and carrying luggage, as well as a manure basket on his back, walking slowly with his head down. He thought: Another cadre going down to the team, carrying so much luggage, really not good. As he got closer, he exclaimed:
    "It's you, Secretary Wang!" And he was about to help carry Secretary Wang's luggage.
    "Old Li, I couldn't bear to break your old bones!" Secretary Wang said with a hearty laugh.
    Old Li then noticed that there was half a basket of manure in the secretary's basket, and said, "You're even carrying a manure basket, picking up manure as you walk?"
    "You see, I've walked more than ten li, and I've accumulated at least five or six jin of manure. A double win, right?"
    Secretary Wang was in his early forties. He had been sent down from the county committee. Now he was the first secretary of the commune's Party committee. This time, when he came down to the brigade, he specially wove a manure basket beforehand, preparing to accumulate fertilizer like the commune members. Old Li thought as he went back: "Yes, many hands make light work, picking up a little is better than nothing, the secretary is doing the right thing." He even made a small calculation in his mind, wanting to compete with the secretary. He went to the brigade to ask for a manure basket, but the captain said he was almost seventy years old, and the wind was strong and the weather was cold, so he wouldn't give him a basket. Old Li was exasperated, and when he returned, he chopped some tree branches and started weaving his own, still thinking about competing with the secretary early the next morning.
    Because he stayed up late weaving the basket, the next morning, when he woke up, it was already bright. He hurriedly washed his face, and ran out with a few old friends carrying manure baskets, everyone muttering.
    "It's late, Secretary Wang might have already gone out."
    As they left the home for the elderly, Old Li walked towards the avenue to the east, which led to the county. There were many vehicles, and naturally more manure. He hadn't walked far when Secretary Wang came over, carrying a heavy manure basket. Before Old Li could even greet him, Secretary Wang said with a smile:
    "Old Li, you're also picking up manure? You're getting old, you should do less!"
    "Oh! Secretary Wang, you're up so early!"
    "The red flag has been carried away by the young men. As for me? I've fallen behind."
    Secretary Wang said with a smile. Old Li didn't want to be outdone and said, "We're downstream, then, see you tomorrow morning!"
    Another day passed. The next morning, before it was even light, Old Li got up. He happily carried his manure basket and ran out. He said to his old friends:
    "Today, we're going to strive to be upstream!"
    He still went east. He hadn't walked far when he noticed a light flickering ahead. He was puzzled, and quickly coughed twice. The light flickered at him, followed by a familiar voice:
    "Old Li, you're up so early!"
    "Oh, it's you again—Secretary Wang!"

    “又是你呀！”
    辽宁省新民县  刘朝荣
    晚饭后，敬老院的李福根大爷，坐在炕上编起筐，他不时得意地对周围的老朋友们说：
    “嗯，不给我筐，不给咱也能编。咳！”
    晌午，天气很暖和，他在街上蹓跶。看见迎面走来一个个子高大的人，穿着青色干部服，戴着狗皮帽，背着行李，另外还背了一个粪筐，低着头慢慢走着。他想：又是哪个干部下队了，还背着个大行李，真不善。等走近一看，他大声说：
    “是你呀，王书记！”说着就要帮着去扛王书记的行李。
    “老李，折了您的老骨头，我可担当不起啊！”王书记爽朗地笑着说。
    李大爷又发现书记的筐里有半筐粪，说：“看你还背个粪筐，走道还拾粪吗？”
    “你看，我走了十多里地，少说也积了五六斤粪，一举两得?？”
    王书记四十挂零了。是县委书记下放来的。现在是公社的党委第一书记。这次下到大队来，事前特地编了一个粪筐，准备同社员一样积肥。李大爷回去时想：“是啊，众人拾柴火焰高，拾一点多一点，书记做得对。”他心里还打了小算盘，要同书记比量比量。他去上大队要粪筐，队长说他快七十岁了，现在风大天冷，不给他筐。李老汉气急了，回来砍了些树条就自个编起来，心里还惦记着明天一早和书记较量的事。
    因为编筐睡得晚了点，第二天清早，他醒来时天已经亮开了。他忙洗了脸，同几个老朋友背着粪筐往外跑，大伙一边叨咕着。
    “晚啦，王书记可能早出去啦。”
    他们出得敬老院，李老汉往东边的大道走，那是通往县里的大道，车辆多，粪也自然多。他走了不远，王书记背着沉甸甸的粪筐走过来了。没等老汉来得及招呼，王书记笑着说：
    “老李，你也拾粪去？年纪大了，还是少干点啊！”
    “啊呀！王书记你起得真早！”
    “红旗被小伙子们扛走了。我吗？落后了。”
    王书记笑着说。李老汉不示弱地说：“咱是下游了，那，明早见吧！”
    一天又过去了。早上天还没亮，李老汉就起来了。高高兴兴地背着粪筐往外跑。他对老朋友们说：
    “今天，咱可争上游啦！”
    他仍然往东去。走了不远，发现前面有一点灯光晃动。他奇怪了，连忙咳嗽了两声，灯光晃了他一下，接着是一个熟悉的口音：
    “老李，你起得真早啊！”
    “啊呀，又是你——王书记！”
