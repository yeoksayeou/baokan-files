Comrades, Friends:

    Today, people from all walks of life in our capital are solemnly gathering here to support the Cameroonian people's struggle for national independence. We are particularly honored to have Mr. Jean-Paul Sande, a representative of the Cameroonian people, participating in our meeting. First of all, please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the All-China Federation of Labor, the All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China, the All-China Youth Federation, and other five organizations, as well as the people from all walks of life in the capital, to extend a warm welcome to Mr. Sande, and through Mr. Sande, to express our highest respect to the Cameroonian people who are bravely carrying out the struggle against colonialism and for national independence.
    The Chinese people are pleased to see that in recent years, the African people's struggle for national independence and against imperialism has developed unprecedentedly and has continuously achieved new victories. The successive holding of the historically significant Bandung Conference, the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference, the Conference of Independent African States, and the All-African People's Conference has greatly promoted the independence movement of the African people. Since the Bandung Conference, countries such as Sudan, Tunisia, Morocco, Ghana, and Guinea have successively declared independence. The heroic Algerian people have established their own Provisional Government and are waging a victorious struggle. The people of Cameroon, Congo, Nigeria, Togo, Kenya, Mozambique, Uganda, Somaliland, Madagascar, Nyasaland, and other places are fighting against imperialism in various forms. At present, the entire African continent, from the Cape of Good Hope to Tangier, from the Atlantic coast to the Indian Ocean coast, is ablaze with the raging fire of national liberation. The African people have awakened. It can be asserted that the day is not far off when the African people will bury imperialism with their own hands!
      In the Common Struggle Against Imperialism
      The Chinese People and the African People Will Always Be United
    The Chinese people, who have achieved victory in the long-term struggle against imperialist aggression, have extremely deep feelings for the African people. Our hearts are forever linked with them. In the past year, the Chinese people have held activities such as supporting "Algeria Day" and "Imperialism Get Out of Africa Day." Recently, we have just carried out activities to support the anti-imperialist struggle of the Congolese people. Today, people from all walks of life in our capital are solemnly gathering here again to support the just struggle of the Cameroonian people. This is very natural for us. Because our enemies are common, and our struggles are also common. We have always regarded the struggle of the African people as our own struggle, and the victory of the African people as our own victory. In the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism, we were united in the past, we are united now, and we will be united forever in the future.
    Comrades, friends! The Asian, African, and all peace-loving and justice-upholding people of the world are holding "Cameroon Day" on this inspiring day. This is not only a strong support from the people of all countries for the Cameroonian people's struggle for national independence, but also a great encouragement to the African brothers and sisters who are still living under the yoke of colonialism. We believe that the Cameroonian people's struggle is not isolated. It is an integral part of the African national independence movement, and also a part of the common cause of the world's people against imperialism and for the defense of peace. The Chinese people, the Asian and African people, and all peace-loving people in the world support their just struggle.
    For a long time, the Cameroonian people have been suffering from colonialist oppression and trampling. As early as before the First World War, Cameroon was occupied by German colonialists. After the war, French and British colonialists replaced the German aggressors and carried out inhumane colonial rule in Cameroon under the "mandate" and "trusteeship" identities self-proclaimed by imperialist robbers. In recent years, French and British colonialists have intensified their economic plunder and military suppression of the Cameroonian people. In the French trusteeship area alone, there are more than 80,000 French colonial troops and police. A large number of patriots have been arrested, exiled, or massacred. Up to now, in this area, more than 50,000 patriots have been imprisoned in concentration camps. However, the Cameroonian people have never stopped their struggle for national independence and against French and British colonialism. The bloody suppression of the colonialists can only strengthen the Cameroonian people's determination to fight for national independence. In 1956, the heroic Cameroonian people began an armed struggle, making a powerful response to the violence of colonialism. For several years, the Cameroonian people have persisted in their struggle in extremely difficult circumstances, not only severely hitting the colonialists, but also inspiring the people in other parts of Africa to oppose colonialism and fight for national independence. The just struggle of the Cameroonian people has won the sympathy and support of the people of Asian and African countries and all peace-loving countries and people in the world. Now, the strength of the Cameroonian people is growing stronger and stronger, and the struggle is rising higher and higher.
      Although the Colonialists Are Making a Last-Ditch Struggle
      Their Doomsday Is Getting Closer and Closer
    Everyone knows that the colonialists will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history. On the contrary, before they die, they will make even more frantic last-ditch struggles, and continue to use cruel repression and political conspiracies to maintain their colonial rule. It is particularly worth noting that American imperialism is taking advantage of the African people's desire for independence to intensify economic plunder and military expansion in the name of "aid" and "development," attempting to replace the old British and French colonialism and impose the shackles of neo-colonialism on the African people. Recently, the imperialist aggressive group headed by the United States has used various conspiracies to undermine the unity of the African people and the unity of the Asian and African people in order to weaken the increasingly high tide of the Asian and African national independence movement. They are especially afraid of the enormous power generated by the strong support of the powerful socialist camp for the national independence movement. Therefore, they are making every effort to provoke and undermine the relationship between socialist countries and the people of countries striving for national independence. However, the awakened Asian and African people responded to the destructive conspiracies of imperialism with closer unity. The series of Asian and African regional conferences recently held powerfully proved that no matter what means the imperialists and their various lackeys use to undermine the just cause of the Asian and African people, they cannot change their destiny of being doomed to a tragic failure!
    The era we live in now is the era when the East wind prevails over the West wind. The strength of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong. The national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have become an irresistible historical trend. The struggle of the people of the world to safeguard peace and oppose war is rising higher and higher day by day. A series of victories achieved by the national independence movement in the past year vividly reflects this situation. The glorious victory of the Iraqi national revolution broke the imperialist chain of aggression in the Middle East. The armed intervention of British and American imperialism in Lebanon and Jordan finally suffered a shameful defeat under the counterattack of the Arab people and the people of the world. The Chinese people's victorious struggle against American imperialism's expansion of aggression against China has placed the American aggressors in an unprecedented state of political and moral isolation. Recently, the great victory of the Cuban people in overthrowing the American-backed dictatorship and the liberation struggle launched by the Congolese people against Belgian colonial rule have greatly inspired all oppressed nations to fight against imperialism and colonialism. All this shows that although the imperialists are flaunting their teeth and claws, they are actually nothing more than a paper tiger that looks strong but is weak inside. Their doomsday is getting closer and closer. Any oppressed nation, as long as it dares to rise up and wage an unyielding struggle against imperialism and persist in the struggle with renewed efforts, it will surely achieve final victory!
      The Cameroonian People Must Embark on the Road to Independence
      All Oppressed People Must Also Be Victorious
    Comrades, friends, we Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported the struggle of the Cameroonian people and the African people for independence and freedom. We will do everything in our power to develop our friendship with the Cameroonian people and the African people, and strengthen our unity and mutual support. We firmly demand that the French and British colonial troops immediately withdraw from Cameroon, that the complete independence of Cameroon must be recognized immediately, and that the colonialist trusteeship system must be ended. We firmly believe that in today's world where the forces of peace are growing stronger and the Asian and African people are unprecedentedly united, the imperialist reactionary forces cannot stop the heroic Cameroonian people and the African people from winning on the road to independence and freedom.
    Comrades, friends, as we gather here, in the distant Cameroonian soil of Africa, Cameroonian brothers and sisters are waging a tenacious struggle against the colonialists in the jungles and plains. We ask Mr. Sande, the representative of the heroic Cameroonian people, to convey the sentiments of our Chinese people to the Cameroonian people: 650 million Chinese people resolutely stand with them. We firmly believe that the Cameroonian people must be victorious, the African people must be victorious, and the Asian people, the Latin American people, and all oppressed people in the world must be victorious!
    Let us shout:
    Long live the Cameroonian people's struggle for national independence!
    Imperialism get out of Cameroon, get out of Africa!
    Long live the African national independence movement!
    Long live the great unity of the Asian and African people!

### 中国人民和喀麦隆人民站在一起  刘宁一在北京支持喀麦隆人民斗争大会上的讲话

    中国人民和喀麦隆人民站在一起
    刘宁一在北京支持喀麦隆人民斗争大会上的讲话同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我们首都各界人民在这里隆重举行集会，支持喀麦隆人民争取民族独立的斗争。我们特别感到荣幸的是我们的大会有喀麦隆人民的代表让·保罗·桑德先生参加。首先，请允许我代表中国亚非团结委员会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中华全国总工会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会、中华全国青年联合会等五团体，以及首都各界人民，向桑德先生表示热烈的欢迎，并通过桑德先生向英勇地进行着反对殖民主义、争取民族独立斗争的喀麦隆人民致以崇高的敬意。
    中国人民高兴地看到，近几年来，非洲人民争取民族独立、反对帝国主义的斗争有了空前蓬勃的发展，并且不断取得新的胜利。具有历史意义的万隆会议、亚非人民团结大会、非洲独立国家会议和全非人民大会的先后举行，大大推动了非洲人民的独立运动。自从万隆会议以来，苏丹、突尼斯、摩洛哥、加纳和几内亚等国家相继宣布了独立，英勇的阿尔及利亚人民已经建立了自己的共和国临时政府，并且正在进行着胜利的斗争。喀麦隆、刚果、尼日利亚、多哥、怯尼亚、莫三鼻给、乌干达、索马里兰、马达加斯加、尼亚萨兰等地的人民，正在通过各种形式，对帝国主义进行着斗争。目前，整个非洲大陆，从好望角到丹吉尔，从大西洋沿岸到印度洋沿岸，到处燃起了民族解放的熊熊烈火。非洲人民已经觉醒。可以断言，非洲人民用自己的双手埋葬掉帝国主义的日子已经不远了！
      在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中
      中国人民非洲人民永远心连心
    在长期反对帝国主义侵略斗争中取得胜利的中国人民，对非洲人民怀着极其深厚的感情，我们的心和他们是永远连在一起的。在过去一年中，中国人民举行了声援“阿尔及利亚日”和“帝国主义滚出非洲日”等等活动。最近，我们刚刚进行了支持刚果人民反帝斗争的活动。今天，我们首都的各界人民又在这里庄严集会，支持喀麦隆人民的正义斗争。这在我们来说是很自然的事情。因为我们的敌人是共同的，我们的斗争也是共同的。我们一向把非洲人民的斗争当作我们自己的斗争，把非洲人民的胜利当作自己的胜利。在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的共同斗争中，我们过去团结在一起，现在团结在一起，将来我们也要永远团结在一起。
    同志们，朋友们！亚洲、非洲人民和全世界一切爱好和平和正义的人民，在这种振奋人心的日子里举行“喀麦隆日”，这不仅是世界各国人民对喀麦隆人民争取民族独立斗争的有力支持，而且也是对还生活在殖民主义枷锁下的非洲兄弟姊妹们的一个巨大的鼓舞。我们认为，喀麦隆人民的斗争不是孤立的，它是非洲民族独立运动的一个组成部分，也是世界人民反对帝国主义、保卫和平共同事业中的一个部分，中国人民、亚非人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民都支持他们的正义斗争。
    长期以来，喀麦隆人民一直遭受着殖民主义的压迫和蹂躏。远在第一次世界大战以前，喀麦隆即为德国殖民主义者所侵占。战后，法、英殖民主义者取代了德国侵略者的地位，并先后以帝国主义强盗自封的“委任统治”和“托管”的身份在喀麦隆进行着惨无人道的殖民统治。近年来，法英殖民主义者更疯狂地加紧了对喀麦隆人民的经济掠夺和军事镇压。仅在法国托管区内，法国殖民军队和警察竟有八万多人。大批爱国者遭到逮捕、流放或屠杀。到目前为止在这一地区，被关进集中营的爱国者已达五万多人。但是，喀麦隆人民从来也没有停止过争取民族独立和反对法英殖民主义的斗争。殖民者的血腥镇压只能更加坚定了喀麦隆人民争取民族独立的决心。1956年，英勇的喀麦隆人民开始了武装斗争，对殖民主义的暴力作出了有力的回答。几年来，喀麦隆人民在十分艰苦的环境下，一直坚持斗争，不仅沉重的打击了殖民主义者，并且鼓舞了非洲其他地区的反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的人民。喀麦隆人民的正义斗争，已经赢得了亚非各国人民以及全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的同情和支持。现在，喀麦隆人民的力量愈来愈强大，斗争愈来愈高涨了。
      尽管殖民主义者垂死挣扎
      他们的末日已经越来越近
    谁都知道，殖民主义者是不会自动地退出历史舞台的。相反，在他们临终以前，还要做出更加疯狂的垂死挣扎，还要继续用残酷镇压和政治阴谋来维持他们的殖民统治。特别值得注意的是，美帝国主义正在利用非洲人民渴望独立的心情，以“援助”和“开发”为名，加紧进行经济掠夺和军事扩张，企图取代英法老牌殖民主义，把新殖民主义的枷锁加在非洲人民的头上。近来，以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团为了要削弱日益高涨的亚非民族独立运动，施展了种种阴谋来破坏非洲各国人民的团结，破坏亚非各国人民的团结。他们尤其害怕强大的社会主义阵营对于民族独立运动强有力的支持所产生的巨大力量，因此，他们更竭力挑拨和破坏社会主义国家同争取民族独立国家人民之间的关系。但是，觉醒了的亚非人民用更加紧密的团结来回答了帝国主义的破坏阴谋。最近召开的一系列的亚非地区会议有力地证明，帝国主义者和它的各式各样的走狗们不管用什么样的手段来破坏亚非人民的正义事业，也无法改变他们注定要遭到悲惨失败的命运！
    我们现在的生活的时代是东风压倒西风的时代。以苏联为首的强大社会主义阵营的力量空前壮大。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族独立运动，已经成为不可抗拒的历史潮流。全世界人民维护和平、反对战争的斗争，一天比一天高涨。一年来，民族独立运动取得的一系列胜利，生动地反映了这种局面。伊拉克民族革命的辉煌胜利打断了帝国主义在中东的侵略锁链。美英帝国主义对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装干涉也终于在阿拉伯人民和全世界人民的反击下遭到了可耻的失败。中国人民反对美帝国主义扩大侵略中国的胜利斗争，使美国侵略者在政治上和道义上陷于空前的孤立。最近，古巴人民推翻受美国支持的独裁政权的伟大胜利和刚果人民掀起的反对比利时殖民统治的解放斗争，更大大地鼓舞了一切被压迫民族反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争。这一切都说明，尽管帝国主义者张牙舞爪，但是，实际上只不过是一个外强中干的纸老虎。他们的末日已经越来越近了。任何被压迫的民族，只要敢于起来向帝国主义作不屈不挠的斗争，再接再厉的坚持斗争，它就一定会取得最后的胜利！
      喀麦隆人民一定要走上独立道路
      一切被压迫人民也都一定要胜利
    同志们，朋友们，我们中国人民一向同情和支持喀麦隆人民和非洲人民争取独立自由的斗争。我们将尽我们的一切努力发展我们和喀麦隆人民、和非洲人民的友谊，并加强我们之间的团结和相互支持。我们坚决要求法英殖民军队立即撤出喀麦隆，必须立即承认喀麦隆的完全独立，必须结束殖民主义者的托管制度。我们坚信：在和平力量日益壮大和亚非人民空前团结的今天，帝国主义反动势力无法阻挡英勇的喀麦隆人民和非洲人民走上独立自由的道路的胜利。
    同志们，朋友们，当我们在这里集会的时候，在遥远的非洲喀麦隆士地上，喀麦隆的兄弟姊妹们正在丛林中和平原上向殖民主义者进行着顽强的斗争。我们请英勇的喀麦隆人民的代表桑德先生把我们中国人民的心意带给喀麦隆人民：六亿五千万中国人民坚决地同他们站在一起。我们深信，喀麦隆人民一定要胜利，非洲人民一定要胜利，亚洲人民、拉丁美洲人民和世界上一切被压迫人民都一定要胜利！
    让我们高呼：
    喀麦隆人民争取民族独立的斗争胜利万岁！
    帝国主义滚出喀麦隆，滚出非洲去！
    非洲的民族独立运动万岁！
    亚非人民大团结万岁！
