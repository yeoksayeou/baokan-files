Comprehensive report from our newspaper: A Xinhua News Agency report indicates that the struggle surrounding the Cyprus issue has once again intensified.

On February 11th, Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis and Turkish Prime Minister Menderes concluded a week-long meeting in Zurich regarding the Cyprus issue. A joint communiqué issued after the meeting stated that the two countries had reached a compromise agreement on the Cyprus issue. The communiqué did not disclose the contents of this agreement. However, according to Western news agencies, the agreement includes the following points: Cyprus will become an "independent republic" that is neither united with Greece nor with Turkey; both Greece and Turkey will station troops in Cyprus; the president of the Republic of Cyprus will be a Cypriot of Greek descent, and the vice president will be a Cypriot of Turkish descent; in the future Cyprus "National Assembly," members of Greek descent will hold 70% of the seats, and members of Turkish descent will hold 30% of the seats.

It is reported that the United States played a special role in the negotiations between Greece and Turkey. Washington's concern about this issue stems from its attempt to weaken Britain's position in Cyprus. Therefore, when this compromise agreement was proposed, Washington immediately expressed its appreciation.

Greek Foreign Minister Averoff and Turkish Foreign Minister Zorlu flew from Zurich to London on the evening of the 11th and held a four-hour meeting with British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, but without result.

On the evening of the 14th, Archbishop Makarios arrived in London to discuss the Cyprus issue with the government leaders of Britain, Greece, and Turkey. One of the main issues of the negotiations will be Britain's demand for sovereignty over military bases in Cyprus. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd publicly declared in the House of Commons that Britain would never relinquish its sovereignty over military bases. This not only means that Britain will have absolute control over the land occupied by the military facilities themselves, but also means that Britain will enjoy complete freedom of movement in traffic between these bases, control security measures on the island, and allow British troops to have extraterritorial rights, and so on. On the other hand, Makarios has stated in talks in Athens that Britain must not retain sovereignty over its bases.

    英希土会谈塞浦路斯问题
    希腊土耳其两国已达成妥协性协议
    英国坚持不让出对军事基地的权利
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：围绕着塞浦路斯问题的斗争，目前又变得尖锐起来了。
    2月11日，希腊首相卡拉曼利斯和土耳其总理曼德列斯在苏黎世结束了关于塞浦路斯问题的为期一周的会谈。会谈后发表的公报说：两国对塞浦路斯问题达成了妥协性的协议。公报没有透露这项协议的内容。但是，据西方通讯社透露，这项协议的内容包括以下各点：塞浦路斯将成为一个“独立的共和国”，既不同希腊联合，也不同土耳其联合；希腊和土耳其两国都将在塞浦路斯驻扎军队；塞浦路斯共和国的总统将由希腊血统的塞浦路斯人担任，副总统将由土耳其血统的塞浦路斯人担任；在未来的塞浦路斯“国民议会”中，希腊血统的议员将占有70％的席位，土耳其血统的议员将占有30％的席位。
    据报道，美国在希腊和土耳其的谈判中起着特殊的作用。华盛顿对这个问题的关心，是由于它企图削弱英国在塞浦路斯的地位。因此，当这个妥协性协议提出以后，华盛顿马上就表示赞赏。
    希腊外交大臣阿维罗夫和土耳其外交部长德鲁已经在11日晚间从苏黎世乘飞机到伦敦，并且同英国外交大臣劳埃德举行了四个钟头的会谈，但是没有结果。
    14日晚，马卡里奥斯主教到达伦敦，准备同英国、希腊和土耳其三国的政府领袖讨论塞浦路斯问题。谈判的主要问题之一将是：英国要求对在塞浦路斯的军事基地拥有主权的问题。英国外交大臣劳埃德在下院曾故意公开地声明，英国决不让出它对军事基地的主权。这不仅意味着英国将对军事设施本身所占用的土地拥有绝对控制权，而且还意味着英国将享有在这些基地之间的交通方面的完全行动自由，控制这个岛上的保安措施，并且让英国军队拥有治外法权，等等。而另一方面，马卡里奥斯已经在雅典的谈话里表示，英国决不能保留对它的基地的主权。
