Xinhua News Agency, 21st: This year, the chemical industry will adopt active measures in both production and capital construction to increase the production of chemical products in order to meet the growing needs of all sectors of the national economy for chemical products.

The chemical industry is an industrial sector with multiple industries, multiple varieties, and services for all aspects of the national economy. Whether it is metallurgy, machinery, coal mining, oil refining, textile, papermaking, food and other industries, as well as agriculture, transportation, and people's daily life, all are inseparable from it. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the state vigorously built a number of chemical raw material bases. In recent years, the growth of basic chemical raw materials has also been very rapid. However, due to the rapid development of China's industry and agriculture, the growth of chemical products still cannot keep up with the needs of all parties. In order to ensure a greater leap forward in all sectors of the national economy this year, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has decided to take the following measures in production:

1.  Actively establish new cooperative relationships and restore old cooperative relationships, so that existing production factories and mines can fully exert their potential. In the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production last year, many changes have taken place in the supply of electricity, coal, ore, some major packaging materials, and transportation required for chemical industry production. In response to this situation, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, in conjunction with the State Economic Commission, convened a cooperation meeting of relevant provinces, cities, and central departments in January to study and resolve the production cooperation issues of eight key chemical enterprises. The power supply to the chemical industry in Northeast China has been increased, and the coal required for coal washing, fuel, and raw materials for the chemical industry has been determined to be supplied by the Ministry of Coal Industry and Hebei, Anhui, Jilin, Liaoning, Gansu and other provinces. For pyrite needed to produce sulfuric acid and limestone needed to produce soda ash, as well as acid-resistant jars needed for packaging, new cooperative relationships have been established or the original cooperative units or regions have been re-designated to be responsible for supply.

2.  Launch a vigorous technical revolution and a mass movement in all production enterprises to achieve the goal of developing the chemical industry with greater, faster, better and more economical results. Such as to develop a large number of new varieties and quickly fill the gaps; adopt new technologies, simplify the process flow, and shorten the reaction time; improve equipment, simplify the structure of equipment, and improve the capacity of equipment; adopt efficient new equipment; comprehensively utilize a variety of raw materials, open up a wide range of raw material sources, and make full use of by-products and waste materials. To this end, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has decided to require factories and mines to deeply mobilize the masses and carry out a vigorous technical revolution movement.

3.  In order to solve the problem of the urgent need for soda ash in the first quarter, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has consulted with Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu, and Qinghai, which are rich in natural alkali, to immediately mine and transport natural alkali to meet the urgent needs and lay the foundation for the full utilization of natural alkali resources in the future. The Ministry of Chemical Industry also suggests that departments that use a large amount of chemical products should carry out or strengthen recycling work. For example, if the papermaking industry strengthens recycling, it can recover more than half of the caustic soda.

4.  Expand the scope of products managed by the ministry and actively strengthen and improve the management of cooperative products. In the past, the chemical products directly managed by the Ministry of Chemical Industry were relatively few, and the management methods for cooperative products could not meet the requirements of production. Now they have decided to expand the scope of products managed by the ministry appropriately and expand cooperative products to more than one hundred kinds (that is, to manage through cooperative forms). This will enable more important chemical products to obtain raw materials and adjust supply and demand on a larger scale.

In terms of capital construction, it is necessary to speed up the progress and quickly bring into play the production capacity of newly built engineering equipment. The measures are:

1.  Concentrate necessary forces to carry out a blitz on finishing works, so that they can be put into production quickly. At present, there are about one or twenty chemical industry capital construction projects that can be completed in about a month if some materials or equipment are transferred. There are also forty or so projects that can be completed and put into trial operation by the end of the first quarter or the beginning of the second quarter after a blitz. After these projects are put into production, this year, the output of sulfuric acid can be increased by more than 200,000 tons, caustic soda by more than 100,000 tons, and the output of soda ash and calcium carbide can also be increased significantly.

2.  Reasonably arrange engineering projects and resolutely adopt the method of starting projects in batches and concentrating on breakthroughs. Advance those that should be advanced, and postpone those that should be postponed. The main equipment for some key projects, such as the Lanzhou Synthetic Rubber Plant, the Taiyuan Synthetic Ammonia Plant, the Jilin Organic Synthesis Plant, and the Sichuan Jintang Synthetic Ammonia Plant, is supplied by foreign countries. At present, a lot of equipment has arrived. Giving these projects more investment in the first and second quarters can enable these projects to be put into production as soon as possible.

3.  Adopt the method of walking on two legs, and continue to resolutely engage in small indigenous groups, small foreign groups, and the combination of indigenous and foreign chemical production. This kind of chemical production is built and used locally, the equipment is simple, non-metallic materials can be widely used, and the investment is small and the effect is quick. After appraisal, the Ministry of Chemical Industry is preparing to promote small-scale production of more than a dozen varieties such as contact sulfuric acid, soda ash, caustic soda, calcium carbide, butyl sodium rubber, and organic raw materials such as acetone, butanol, and furfural. The first step is to build in major cities and people's communes with better conditions.

In addition, the Ministry of Chemical Industry suggests that relevant industrial departments engage in some chemical industry themselves. For example, the metallurgical, light industry, petroleum, machinery, and railway departments all need a lot of chemical products such as sulfuric acid and caustic soda. These things are not easy to transport, and it will be more convenient and economical to organize production near the units that need them. At the same time, some by-products of industrial departments are extremely valuable chemical raw materials and should be comprehensively utilized. For example, the tail gas from non-ferrous metal smelting can be used to make sulfuric acid, the coking industry can recover tar, benzene, anthracene, naphthalene, etc., artificial petroleum and the coking industry can recover synthetic ammonia, and salt brine can recover bromine, etc. (Attached picture)

The staff of the evaporation section of the Shenyang Chemical Plant worked hard and cleverly, and boldly changed the feeding method, and produced 600 tons of caustic soda in 27 days. The staff expressed their determination to ensure the completion of the February production plan ahead of schedule, and overproduce more than a dozen tons. This is the workers are transporting caustic soda.

    保证国民经济各部门更大跃进
    多快好省发展化学工业
    化工部采取措施挖掘生产潜力加快基本建设速度
    新华社21日讯　今年化学工业将从生产和基建两方面采取积极措施，提高化工产品的生产，以满足国民经济各部门对化工产品的日益增长的需要。
    化学工业是一个多行业、多品种、为国民经济各方面服务的工业部门。无论冶金、机械、采煤、炼油、纺织、造纸、食品等工业和农业、交通运输业以及人民日常生活都离不开它。在第一个五年计划期间，国家曾大力建设了若干个化工原料基地，几年以来，基本化工原料的增长也是很快的，但是，由于我国工农业的飞快的发展，化工产品的增长仍然赶不上各方面的需要，为了保证今年国民经济各部门更大的跃进，化学工业部决定在生产方面采取以下措施：
    一、积极建立新的协作关系，恢复旧的协作关系，使现有生产厂矿充分发挥潜力。在去年工农业生产大跃进中，化学工业生产所需要的电力、煤炭、矿石、一部分主要包装材料的供应和交通运输都发生了许多变化，化工部针对这一情况，已经会同国家经济委员会在一月间召开有关省市和中央部门的协作会议，研究解决了八个重点化工企业的生产协作问题。东北地区对化工的供电已予提高，化工需要的洗煤和燃料、原料用煤已确定由煤炭部和河北、安徽、吉林、辽宁、甘肃等省负责供应。对于生产硫酸需要的硫铁矿和生产纯碱需要的石灰石，以及包装需要的耐酸坛子等等，都分别确定了新的协作关系或重新确定原协作单位或地区负责供应。
    二、在一切生产企业中大闹技术革命，大搞群众运动，以达到多快好省地发展化学工业的目的。如要大量发展新品种，迅速补齐缺门；采用新技术，简化工艺流程，缩短反应时间；改进设备，简化设备的结构，提高设备的能力，采用高效率的新型设备；综合利用多种原料，开辟广泛的原料来源，充分利用副产和废料等等。化工部为此已决定要求厂矿企业深入发动群众，开展轰轰烈烈的技术革命运动。
    三、为了解决第一季度各方面急需的纯碱供应问题，化工部已经和盛产天然碱的内蒙古、新疆、甘肃和青海等地商妥，立即开采和运输天然碱以应急需，并为今后充分利用天然碱的资源奠定基础。化工部并建议大量使用化工产品的部门，进行或加强回收工作。如造纸工业加强回收，就可以收回一半以上的烧碱。
    四、扩大部管产品范围，积极加强和改善协作产品的管理。过去化工部直接管理的化工产品较少，对协作产品的管理方法也不能适应生产的要求，现在他们决定除适当扩大部管产品范围外，并把协作产品扩大到一百种以上（即通过协作形式来管理）。这样做可以使更多的重要化工产品，能够在更大的范围以内取得原材料和调剂供求。
    在基本建设方面要加快进度，迅速发挥新建工程设备的生产能力。措施是：
    一、集中必要的力量，突击扫尾工程，使之迅速投入生产。目前大约有一、二十个化学工业的基本建设工程，只要调给部分材料或设备，就可以在一个月左右建成。还有四十几个工程，经过突击，可以在第一季末或第二季初扫尾试车。这些工程投入生产以后，今年，就可以增产硫酸二十几万吨，烧碱十几万吨，纯碱和电石等产量也可以增加不少。
    二、合理安排工程项目，坚决采取分批上马、集中突击的办法，该提前的提前，该推迟的推迟。有些重点工程，如兰州合成橡胶厂、太原合成氨厂、吉林有机合成厂、四川金堂合成氨厂等的主要设备由国外供应，目前设备已到了很多，在一二季度多给这些工程一些投资，就可以使这些工程尽快投入生产。
    三、采取两条腿走路的办法，继续坚决地搞小土群、小洋群和土洋结合的化工生产。这种化工生产就地建设就地使用，设备简单，可以广泛利用非金属材料，并且投资少，收效快。化工部在经过鉴定后，准备推广接触硫酸、纯碱、烧碱、电石、丁钠橡胶，有机原料如丙酮、丁醇、糖醛等十几个品种的小型生产。第一步先在主要城市和条件较好的人民公社中建设。
    此外，化工部建议有关工业部门自己搞些化学工业。如冶金、轻工、石油、机械和铁道部门都需要很多化工产品如硫酸、烧碱等。这些东西都不便于运输，而在需要单位就近组织生产将更方便更经济。同时，有些工业部门的副产品，是极为宝贵的化工原料，应该加以综合利用。如有色金属冶炼的尾气可以做硫酸，炼焦工业能回收焦油、苯、蒽、萘等，人造石油和炼焦工业都可以回收合成氨，盐卤可以回收溴素等。（附图片）
    沈阳化工厂蒸发工段职工苦干、巧干，大胆改变加料方法，二十七天就生产了六百吨烧碱。职工们表示坚决保证提前完成二月份的生产计划，再超产十几吨。这是工人们在运烧碱。
