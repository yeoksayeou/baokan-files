Xuecheng Coking Plant Formulates Great Leap Forward Plan
First Quarter to Produce Over 90,000 Tons of High-Quality Coke

Jinan, February 2nd (This newspaper reports) The Xuecheng Coking Plant, the first coking plant in Teng County, Shandong Province, mobilized the masses to summarize the experience of the 1958 coke production in both quantity and quality. It has formulated an advanced plan to produce 94,000 tons of high-quality coke in the first quarter.

Last year, the plant's coke production increased by 2.35 times compared to 1957, and the quality also greatly exceeded the prescribed standards. Recently, the plant organized employees to summarize last year's production experience. Everyone believes that putting politics in command, ideological leadership, and emphasizing quality along with quantity are the fundamental guarantees for improving coke quality. Launching mass technical innovations is a key to improving coke quality. Strict implementation of operating procedures plays an important role in improving coke quality. They closely grasped key processes such as coal washing, coal selection, charging, and fire watching. Based on past experience, they formulated technical operation specifications and resolutely implemented them. At the same time, the "division of labor system" and "certificate of conformity" were generally implemented. All this has promoted the improvement of coke quality.

After this mass summary, all the factory employees have doubled their enthusiasm and are striving to complete the plan to produce 94,000 tons of high-quality coke in the first quarter.

    薛城炼焦厂制定跃进计划
　  第一季度产九万多吨优质焦
    本报济南2日电　山东省滕县第一炼焦厂——薛城炼焦厂，发动群众总结1958年焦炭生产数量、质量双跃进的经验，制定了第一季度生产优质焦九万四千吨的先进计划。
    去年这个厂的焦产量比1957年增长二点三五倍，质量也大大超过了规定的标准。最近，这个厂组织职工群众总结了去年的生产经验。大家认为，政治挂帅，思想领先，重量又重质是提高焦炭质量的根本保证。大搞群众性的技术革命，是提高焦炭质量的一个重要关键。严格执行操作规程，对提高焦炭质量有重要作用。他们紧紧掌握了洗煤、选煤、装池、看火等关键工序，根据以往经验，订出技术操作规格要求，切实贯彻执行。同时，普遍实行了“划分制”和“合格证”。这都促进了焦炭质量的提高。
    经过这番群众性的总结，全厂职工，干劲倍增，正为完成第一季度产优质焦九万四千吨的计划而奋斗。
