    Soviet Scientists Go to Factories
    (By our Correspondent) Moscow - The Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has decided to establish a comprehensive laboratory at the famous Moscow First Ball Bearing Plant to help the factory automate its operations. The First Ball Bearing Plant is scheduled to further advance towards automation during the Seven-Year Plan, establishing comprehensive automated workshops. Over the seven years, the factory's production capacity will be expanded by 75% through equipment upgrades and the adoption of new technologies.
    Scientists from the Academy of Sciences' Institute of Mechanical Engineering, Automation, Remote Control, Mathematics, and Economics will participate in the work of this comprehensive laboratory. They will study issues related to the comprehensive automation of factory production and production technology. Scientists will also study the issue of "automatic adjustment devices." These devices can replace adjustment workers in automatically adjusting lathes.
    This comprehensive laboratory will also establish its own research department, recruiting factory comrades interested in scientific work as graduate students. Therefore, the laboratory will effectively become a branch of the Academy of Sciences established within the factory.

    苏联科学家下工厂
    本报讯　苏联科学院主席团决定在苏联著名的莫斯科第一轴承工厂设立一个综合实验室，帮助这个工厂进行自动化的工作，第一轴承工厂预定在七年计划期间进一步向自动化迈进，建立综合的自动化车间。七年之间，通过改装设备和采用新技术，工厂的生产能力将要扩大75％。
    参加这个综合实验室工作的，将有科学院所属机械学、自动化、远距离控制、数学和经济学等研究所的科学家。他们将研究工厂生产的综合自动化和生产工艺学的问题。科学家们还将研究“自动调整装置”问题。这种装置可以代替调整工人自动调节车床。
    这个综合实验室还要设立自己的研究部，吸收工厂内对科学工作有兴趣的同志作研究生。因此，实验室实际上将成为科学院在工厂内设立的分院。
