Respected Prince Halsei and distinguished Omani guests: Comrades, friends:

Today, we gather here with great excitement and joy to solemnly hold this meeting to welcome the representatives of the Omani people, who are engaged in a heroic anti-colonialist struggle, His Royal Highness Prince Halsei, Deputy Imam of Oman, and distinguished guests. First of all, please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, the China Islamic Association, and the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, to express our highest respect and brotherly greetings to our distinguished guests, and through you, to the heroic Omani people who are engaged in the anti-colonialist struggle.

The Omani people, who have long suffered from the cruel oppression and exploitation of imperialism, in order to break free from the shackles of imperialism, and to strive for their own national independence and freedom, under the leadership of the Imam of Oman, launched an anti-British uprising in July 1957. This is an important component of the Arab people's movement to strive for national independence and oppose colonialism. The heroic Omani people, under extremely difficult conditions, facing the British invading forces armed with modern weapons, have carried out heroic and tenacious struggles, and have won the sympathy and admiration of peace-loving people all over the world. After suffering a series of defeats in the Middle East Arab region in recent years, in order to maintain its remaining colonial rule and strengthen the plunder and control of the rich resources under the Buraimi Oasis, British imperialism has not only mobilized a large number of troops to suppress the uprising of the Omani people, but also constantly dispatched aircraft to indiscriminately bomb peaceful Omani villages and innocent people. This barbaric act of aggression by British imperialism has aroused great indignation and condemnation from peace-loving people all over the world. American imperialism has always coveted the resources of the Middle East and attempted to replace Britain and France. Therefore, on the Oman issue, it has used double-dealing tactics and colluded with Britain in an attempt to divide Oman's resources, but this conspiracy of American imperialism has long been exposed in front of the awakened Omani people and their leaders who have been tempered in the struggle, arousing the indignation and condemnation of the vast Omani people.

Comrades, friends! We are now in an era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, an era that is extremely favorable to the movements for peace and national independence and liberation. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is thriving. The movement for national independence, supported by socialist countries and peace-loving people all over the world, has formed an irresistible historical trend. The colonial system of imperialism has collapsed. In recent years, especially since the Bandung Conference, the movements for national independence in the Middle East Arab region, as well as in Africa and Latin America, have developed unprecedentedly and have continuously achieved brilliant victories. Many countries in the Asian-African region have successively declared independence. The failure of the British and French aggression against Egypt, the success of the national revolution in Iraq, the forced withdrawal of American and British imperialism from Lebanon and Jordan, and the anti-colonialist struggles of the Omani and other Middle Eastern peoples have all dealt serious blows to imperialism. The long-sleeping African continent has awakened, and struggles for national independence have been launched everywhere. The heroic Algerian people have inflicted fatal blows on the French colonialists in recent years. The Congo, which was called an "oasis of stability" by the Belgian colonialists, broke out a struggle for national independence not long ago. For imperialism, volcanoes are everywhere, some have already erupted, and some are about to erupt. The flames of the struggle for national independence have spread throughout the entire African continent. At the same time, a great fire has also been ignited in Latin America, which is regarded by American imperialism as its backyard. The Batista traitorous dictatorial regime, which was single-handedly supported by American imperialism, has been overthrown by the Cuban revolution under the leadership of General Castro. The crude act of American interference in Cuba's internal affairs has been severely condemned by the Cuban people and the people of the world. Due to the impact of the victory of the Cuban revolution, some reactionary dictatorial regimes supported by American imperialism, facing the storm of national independence and the end of American imperialism's rule in Latin America, are already crumbling. The days when imperialism could run rampant in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are gone forever. Its good days are over, although it is still baring its teeth and claws, looking powerful, it is actually just a paper tiger. As long as the people who are still under the rule of imperialism unite under the banner of anti-colonialism, make persistent efforts, and persist in the struggle, they will definitely be able to overthrow the rule of imperialism and achieve final victory.

Although the imperialists have suffered serious blows, historical experience tells us that they will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history. Faced with the rising national independence movement of the Arab people, the imperialists, on the one hand, are stepping up armed suppression, and on the other hand, are trying their best to use political division and economic inducement conspiracies. They are trying their best to undermine the relations between socialist countries and the people of Arab countries, and trying their best to undermine the unity between Arab countries and within countries, in order to achieve their sinister aim of breaking them up one by one and dividing and ruling them. We firmly believe that the people of Arab countries, who have awakened and have carried out long-term heroic struggles against imperialism, will be able to see through these enemy conspiracies. As long as sufficient vigilance is given, these conspiracies are doomed to fail.

Although our country and the Arab countries are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, there have been exchanges in history. It is only in recent years that they have been artificially cut off by imperialism. In the past long-term struggle against imperialism and after liberation, the people of our country have always deeply sympathized with the movement of the people of Arab countries to strive for national independence. In recent years, on the common front against imperialism and for peace, the friendship between the Chinese people and the Arab people has developed anew. Through His Royal Highness the Prince's visit to China, the friendly relations between the Chinese people and the Omani people and all the Arab people will surely be further developed. The Chinese people deeply sympathize with the Omani people's struggle for national independence and are deeply impressed by the Omani people's spirit of hard struggle under extremely difficult conditions. The Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Omani people and strongly condemn the shameless crimes of the imperialists' aggression against Oman and the barbaric massacre of the Omani people. We resolutely demand that the imperialists immediately stop the aggression being carried out in Oman and demand the immediate withdrawal of the imperialist invading forces.

Comrades, friends! As we are holding this meeting here, in the land of the Omani people, the Omani brothers and sisters are engaged in a heroic and tenacious struggle. The struggle is arduous and long-term. Please convey our friendship to the Omani people. We firmly support you. Victory will surely belong to the Omani people who are fighting to the end for national independence and freedom.

Let us shout:

Long live the victory of the Omani people's struggle for national independence!

Long live the victory of the Arab countries' anti-colonialist struggle!

Long live the solidarity between the Chinese people and the Omani people!

Long live world peace!

    坚决支持阿曼人民的斗争
    包尔汉在欢迎阿曼副教长哈尔塞亲王大会上的讲话
    尊敬的哈尔塞亲王殿下和各位阿曼贵宾：同志们、朋友们：
    今天我们以非常兴奋和愉快的心情，在这里隆重举行集会，欢迎来自正在进行着反殖民主义英勇斗争的阿曼人民代表、阿曼副教长哈尔塞亲王殿下和各位贵宾们。首先，请允许我代表中国亚非团结委员会、中国伊斯兰教协会、中国人民对外文化协会，向我们的贵宾们，并通过你们向正在进行着反殖民主义斗争的英雄的阿曼人民表示崇高的敬意和致以兄弟的问候。
    长期遭受帝国主义残酷压迫和剥削的阿曼人民，为了挣脱帝国主义的枷锁，为了争取自己的民族独立自由，在阿曼教长的领导下，于1957年7月举行了反英起义。这是阿拉伯人民争取民族独立、反对殖民主义运动的一个重要组成部分。英勇的阿曼人民在极端艰苦的条件下，面临着掌握着近代化武器的英国侵略军，进行了英勇顽强的斗争，赢得了全世界爱好和平的人民的同情和敬佩。英帝国主义近几年来在中东阿拉伯地区遭到一连串失败后，为了维持残存的殖民统治和加强对布赖米绿洲地下丰富资源的掠夺和控制，不仅调动了大批军队对阿曼人民的起义进行镇压，并不断出动飞机对阿曼的和平村庄和无辜的人民滥施轰炸。英帝国主义这种野蛮的侵略行动已引起了全世界爱好和平人民极大的愤慨和谴责。美帝国主义一向垂涎中东地区的富源并企图取英法而代之。因而，在阿曼问题上，施展两面手法，并与英国勾结，企图瓜分阿曼的富源，但美帝国主义的这种阴谋诡计在已觉醒了并在斗争中经过锻炼的阿曼人民面前早已暴露无遗，引起了广大阿曼人民及其领导者的愤慨和谴责。
    同志们、朋友们！我们现在正处在一个东风压倒西风的时代，是一个极有利于争取和平和民族独立解放运动的时代，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国正在蒸蒸日上。受到社会主义国家和全世界爱好和平人民支持的民族独立运动已经形成了一股不可抗拒的历史潮流。帝国主义的殖民主义体系已经土崩瓦解。近几年来，特别是万隆会议以后，中东阿拉伯地区以及非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动有了空前蓬勃的发展，并且不断取得了辉煌的胜利。许多亚非地区的国家相继宣布了独立，英法侵略埃及的失败，伊拉克民族革命的成功，美英帝国主义被迫从黎巴嫩和约旦的撤军，阿曼以及其他中东地区人民的反殖民主义的斗争，都给予了帝国主义以严重的打击。沉睡已久的非洲大陆已经觉醒，到处都掀起了民族独立的斗争。英勇的阿尔及利亚人民，几年来给予了法国殖民者以致命的打击。被比利时殖民者称为“安定的绿洲”的刚果，在不久以前爆发了争取民族独立的斗争。对帝国主义来说，到处是火山，有的已经爆发，有的将要爆发。争取民族独立斗争的烽火已燃遍了整个非洲大陆。同时，被美帝国主义视为自己后院的拉丁美洲也烧起了大火。由美帝国主义一手所扶持起来的巴蒂斯塔卖国独裁政权，已被在卡斯特罗将军领导下的古巴革命所推翻。美国干涉古巴内政的粗暴行为遭到了古巴和全世界人民严厉的谴责。由于古巴革命的胜利的影响，一些被美帝国主义所扶持起来的反动独裁政权，面临着拉丁美洲要求民族独立、结束美帝国主义统治的风暴，已在摇摇欲坠。帝国主义在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲任意横行霸道的日子已经一去不复返了。它的好日子已经过去了，尽管它还在张牙舞爪，看起来貌似强大，但是，实际上不过是一只纸老虎。只要目前还在受着帝国主义统治下的人民在反对殖民主义的旗帜下团结一致，再接再厉，坚持斗争，就一定能够推翻帝国主义的统治，取得最后的胜利。
    帝国主义者虽然遭受了严重的打击，但历史的经验告诉我们，它们是不会自动退出历史舞台的。面临着民族独立运动高涨的阿拉伯人民，帝国主义者一方面加紧武装镇压，另方面竭力施展政治离间和经济利诱的阴谋手段。竭力破坏社会主义国家和阿拉伯国家人民之间的关系，竭力破坏阿拉伯各国之间和国家内部的团结，以达到它们各个击破分而治之的阴险目的。我们深信，已经觉醒了并且与帝国主义进行过长期英勇斗争的阿拉伯各国人民是能够识破敌人这些奸计的。只要给予足够的警惕，这些阴谋是注定要失败的。
    我国和阿拉伯各国虽然相隔千山万水，历史上却早有来往。只是近年来被帝国主义人为地割断了。我国人民在过去长期反对帝国主义的斗争中和取得解放以后，一向对阿拉伯各国人民为争取民族独立的运动寄予深厚的同情。近几年来，在反对帝国主义和争取和平的共同战线上，中国人民和阿拉伯人民之间的友谊有了新的发展。通过亲王殿下这次访问中国，中国同阿曼人民和全体阿拉伯人民的友好关系必将得到进一步的发展。中国人民对阿曼人民争取民族独立的斗争抱着深切的同情，对阿曼人民在极其困难的条件下，艰苦奋斗的精神，感到十分敬佩。中国人民坚决支持阿曼人民的正义斗争，严厉地谴责帝国主义者侵略阿曼和对阿曼人民进行野蛮屠杀的无耻罪行。我们坚决要求帝国主义者立即停止在阿曼所进行的侵略，要求立即撤退帝国主义侵略军。
    同志们，朋友们！正当我们在这里举行集会的时候，在遥远的阿曼人民的土地上，阿曼的兄弟姊妹们正在进行着英勇顽强的斗争，斗争是艰苦的，也是长期的，请贵宾们把我们的情谊转达给阿曼人民，我们是坚决支持你们的。胜利一定属于为民族独立和自由而斗争到底的阿曼人民。
    让我们高呼：
    阿曼人民争取民族独立斗争的胜利万岁！
    阿拉伯国家反殖民主义斗争的胜利万岁！
    中国人民和阿曼人民的团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
