Xinhua News Agency, February 11th—According to TASS: The Soviet "Beryozka" Dance Ensemble has concluded its three-month tour in the United States and returned to Moscow by plane on the 8th.

The "Beryozka" Dance Ensemble performed a total of 87 shows in major American cities such as New York, Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, and Philadelphia, and also performed six shows in Canada. More than 200,000 audience members watched the ensemble's performances in theaters, and millions more enjoyed the ensemble's programs on television.

The dance ensemble received a warm welcome everywhere in the United States. American newspapers gave high praise to the ensemble's performances.

The famous American theater manager Sol Hurok recently told a TASS reporter that, like other Soviet artistic groups touring the United States, the successful performances of "Beryozka" have aroused great interest among Americans in the Russian people and their rich culture. He hopes that this kind of cultural exchange, which can promote further understanding between the peoples of the two countries, can be developed and continue to achieve the same success.
