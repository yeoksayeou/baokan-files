　　Thousands of Households Busy Accumulating Manure

　　By our reporter Jin Feng

　　At the foot of the Langya Mountains, along the banks of the Yi River, puffs of smoke rise, enveloping the fields and villages far and near.

　　Wisps of blue smoke rise gracefully from the fields, from beside the village houses, from the courtyards of every household, taking advantage of the first breeze of spring.

　　Is it cooking smoke? Cooking smoke doesn't appear in the fields. Is it a bonfire? A bonfire doesn't rise in the courtyard. This is the rich feast that the 600,000 people of Yi County, Hebei Province, have prepared for the earth in order to strive for a greater harvest this year!

　　As soon as the east reveals a glimmer of dawn, the small village of Shizhuang Production Team of the Chengguan People's Commune in Yi County is fully awakened. At this time, every household is busy with a thorough cleaning. This year, everyone is cleaning particularly carefully, sweeping down all the dust from the beams, rafters, corners, and roofs – what excellent fertilizer! Cleaning the tables, benches, chests, cabinets, jars, and pots to have a fresh, clean Spring Festival.

　　By this time, Li Fenglan, twenty-three years old, and her mother-in-law had already finished cleaning the house. This mother, who had given birth just two months ago, kept carrying the dirty soil to the fields by the village, before returning to breastfeed her little daughter. The child's face was already red from crying. The mother-in-law felt sorry for her granddaughter and thought to complain to her daughter-in-law, but then saw Fenglan carrying back a load of yellow soil and piling it in the house. She couldn't help but ask in surprise, "What's this for?" Fenglan smiled slightly: "The village Party secretary called on every household to make nitrogen-fixing bacteria yesterday. This is the material for nitrogen-fixing bacteria." As she spoke, she gently put her full daughter on the kang. She got off the kang, took three jin of sweet potato flour, five jin of quicklime, mixed it with the soil, added some water, and stirred it all together, then poked some air holes with chopsticks. "In seven days, the nitrogen-fixing bacteria will be ready." As she said this, she stoked the coal fire on the kang to make it burn hotter so that it would ferment faster.

　　At this time, Wang Xiuzhen, twenty-six years old, who was cooking in the canteen, was busy stuffing bundles of firewood into the stove as quickly as possible. Meals for three hundred people were waiting to be prepared. The firewood crackled, but puffs of thick smoke did not escape from the chimney, but rose from a large pile of smoked fertilizer behind the kitchen. Ah, smoke that used to be wasted into the air is now being captured and utilized by Wang Shuzhen and her female companions (four in total). This smoked fertilizer pile, built from clods of earth behind the kitchen, contains more than 100,000 jin.

　　When the commune members had all eaten their steaming millet porridge, the bell for work rang. Here and there, by the fields, in every household, some were dismantling earthen walls, some were piling manure, and some were lighting fires to smoke fertilizer. "Accumulate more manure, eat more refined grains. With white flour, we'll eat buns and dumplings!" Li Rui and Li Qingming, both forty-eight years old, were talking and laughing as they spread mud on the manure pile with shovels. The four families together built thirty earthen fertilizer piles. On the other side of the wall, five-year-old Wang Qiufeng and six-year-old Li Jinhua, imitating their parents, built two small fertilizer piles with clods of earth. Little Qiufeng brought a pile of wheat straw, and little Jinhua crawled on the ground blowing on the fire. They were also busy accumulating manure!

　　Walking out of the south of the village, wisps of blue smoke rose from the earthen ridges. These were rows of newly built smoked fertilizer piles. They dug five round pits, each nine chi deep and eight chi wide, and filled them with a layer of manure, a layer of soil, and a layer of animal manure. Branches were placed at the bottom to keep them ventilated, and they were heated with a low fire. Fertilizer produced in this way after seven days of smoking has a very high fertilizer efficiency. Now one pit has been smoked, and Wang Fengxi is taking out the fertilizer. The dark brown, almost black, fertilizer looks very appealing. This village has twenty-seven such smoked fertilizer pits.

　　Walking a few dozen steps further, surrounded by the small woods, blue smoke swirls. Here are two large fertilizer kilns built by the villagers who went out to build reservoirs. They dug a large pit nine chi five cun deep, nine chi wide, and more than three zhang long. They built two fertilizer kilns with clods of earth, with a furnace opening made of bricks on one side and two earthen chimneys on the other. People squatted in the pit and burned two fertilizer kilns at the same time, each kiln containing more than 300,000 jin of soil fertilizer.

　　Walking further west, in the fields west of the village, appeared rectangular smoked fertilizer kilns built on the ground. These were built in three rows. Smoked for seven days, this yields 400,000 jin of fertilizer. Turning to the fields east of the village, here is a large circular fertilizer jar built in two rows. This one is larger than the previous two, containing a full 500,000 jin of soil fertilizer. These fertilizer kilns were all built under the guidance of Old Wang Fu. He used to work in brick kilns and knew how to fire kilns and build stoves. Now that he is older, he never expected that this skill of his would be used in smoking fertilizer.

　　Under those two large fertilizer kilns, while smoking the fertilizer, large pots are placed to boil soil fertilizer. Now, Xu Guixiang and Li Shuqin are guarding the pots, one adding firewood to the stove and the other constantly stirring with a large stick.

　　At this time, the pig farm of this production team was also very lively. Zhang Xiuting, the pig farm director, and the feeder Li Zheng, were driving the sows out of the pens in batches to eat their breakfast. This pig farm is the pride of Zhang Xiuting and the Shizhuang Production Team – it has a total of 105 pigs, 103 of which are sows, and 100 of them are pregnant. They are due to give birth to piglets next month. Calculating six or seven piglets per litter, that's more than 700 pigs. By the end of 1959, they will have bred more than 2,000 pigs. Their team has more than 1,800 mu of land, averaging more than one pig per mu. Each pig accumulates three cartloads of manure per month, and thirty-six cartloads per year, which is 54,000 jin. Just raising pigs can supply all the fertilizer their team needs.

　　By then, the sun had risen high, and the manure transportation team had already delivered more than twenty loads of manure to the fields along the village road. The girls, like the men, picked up two full baskets of manure and walked away. The dozens of young men who returned from the Wangkuai Reservoir in Fuping to celebrate the Spring Festival were not willing to admit defeat in front of the girls. They picked up manure and flew like the wind, singing and carrying, carrying and singing. It was too hot to wear cotton clothes, and they only wore single shirts and trousers, which made them look even more energetic. Over there, the oxcart team was dispatched. Leading the way were three oxcarts from the Chengguan Central Store supporting manure accumulation, followed by two carts from the Wood Industry Cooperative, followed by three carts from the team; and finally, thirteen-year-old Zhang Fu and four or five children of the same age pulled a rubber-wheeled cart, following quickly. The handcart team followed closely behind. This manure transportation team, noisy in the early spring sunshine, moved towards the fields, scattering manure on the thriving wheat that was branching. This year, they will strive for a yield of 1,000 jin per mu here!

　　In the distance, a cloud of smoke enveloped the villages and trees. This is other villages smoking fertilizer piles.

　　Now, how many people in the whole of China must be arranging a grand feast for Mother Earth! Last year, hundreds of millions of mu of land were deep-plowed, and thousands of streams flowed into the fields. The earth opened its chest, which had been bound for thousands of years, breathing freely and greedily drinking clean water. Now, lying in the embrace of the spring breeze, it is waiting for the feast that people have prepared for it. It will give people ten times, a hundred times what people give it!

    万户烟云忙积肥
    本报记者　金凤
    狼牙山下，易水河畔，升起团团烟云，笼罩着远远近近的田野、村庄。
    袅袅的青烟，从田野里，从村舍旁，从家家户户的院子里，趁着春天的第一阵微风，袅袅婷婷地上升着。
    是炊烟？炊烟不会出现在田野里。是篝火，篝火不会升起在院子里。这是河北省易县的六十万人民，为争取今年的更大丰收，给大地安排的丰盛的筵席！
    东方刚露出一线曙光，那易水河畔的一个小村——易县城关人民公社的石庄生产队，就完全苏醒过来了。这时候，家家户户都在忙着大扫除。今年各家打扫得特别仔细。把梁上、椽上、屋角、房顶的尘土统统扫下来，这是多么好的肥料！把桌子、板凳、箱柜、坛罐都洗干净，过一个新鲜、光洁的春节。
    这时候，二十三岁的李凤兰已经和她的婆婆把房子打扫完毕。这个生了孩子刚满两个月的母亲一直把脏土送到村边地里，才回来给小女儿喂乳。孩子的小脸已经哭得通红。婆婆心疼小孙女，心想埋怨媳妇几句，又见凤兰担回一挑黄土，堆在屋里。她忍不住惊奇地问：“这干什么？”凤兰微微一笑：“昨天村支书号召每家每户做固氮菌，这就是固氮菌的材料。”说着她把吃饱了乳的女儿轻轻放在炕上。自己下炕拿了三斤薯干面，五斤小灰，和在土里，又舀些水一起拌匀了，再用筷子插了些通气孔。“过七天，固氮菌就成啦。”说着，她又把炕头的煤火通得旺些，让它发酵得更快些。
    这时候，在食堂做饭的二十六岁的王秀珍正忙着把一把把柴火急匆匆塞到灶膛里去。三百来人的饭食急待做起。柴火烧得毕剥毕剥的响，而一股股浓烟并没有从烟囱里跑出去，却从厨房背后的一大堆熏肥堆里冒出来。烟啊，过去白白地浪费到空中，现在，王淑珍和她的女伴（一共四个）想法把它们捕捉起来，利用起来。她们在厨房背后用土坷垃堆的这个熏肥堆足足有十多万斤。
    当社员都吃过热气腾腾的小米干饭，上工的钟声响了。这里那里，田边地角，家家户户，有的在拆土墙，有的在堆肥堆，有的在点火熏肥。“多积肥，多吃细粮。有了白面，吃包子，吃饺子！”四十八岁的李瑞和李清明一面用铁锹往肥堆上涂泥，一面说说笑笑。他们四家一起垒了三十个土肥堆。墙那边，五岁的王秋凤和六岁的李金花学着爸爸妈妈的样子，用土坷垃垒了两个小肥堆。小秋凤捧来一堆麦秸，小金花爬在地上吹火，她们也忙着积肥咧！
    走出村南，土埂上冒出缕缕的青烟。这原来是一排新垒的熏肥堆。他们挖了五个圆坑，每个坑深九尺，宽八尺，装上一层大粪，一层土，一层牲口粪，里面用树枝垫底，架空了用微火温着。这样熏七天，制出的肥料肥效很高。现在一个坑已经熏好了，王凤喜正往外掏肥料。深褐色透黑的肥料，看来十分惹人喜爱。这个村有二十七个这样的熏肥坑。
    走过去几十步，小树林边，青烟缭绕。这里是这个村出外修水库的民工盘起的两个大肥窑。他们挖下九尺五寸深、九尺宽、三丈多长的一个大坑。用土坷垃垒起两个肥窑，一边用砖砌成炉口，一边砌出两个土烟囱。人蹲在坑里同时烧着两个肥窑，一窑就有三十多万斤土肥。
    再往西走，村西地里出现了平地垒起的长方形的熏肥窑。这是三排垒起的。熏七天，就是四十万斤肥料。转到村东地里，这里是二排垒的一个圆形的大肥坛。这一个比前两个都大，足足有五十万斤土肥。这几个肥窑都是老王福掌握着垒的。他以前在砖窑上待过，会烧窑，会盘炉子。如今他年纪大了，没想到他这一手技术在熏肥上用上了。
    在那两个大肥窑下面，一面烧火熏肥，一面放着大锅熬土化肥。现在，徐桂香和李淑琴正守在锅边熬着。一个向灶里添柴，一个用大棒不断地掏着。
    这时候，这个生产队的养猪场也十分热闹。养猪场场长张秀亭正和饲养员李正等把母猪从猪栏里一批批赶出来，吃它们的早饭。这个猪场是张秀亭也是石庄生产队的骄傲——共有一百零五头猪，一百零三头都是母猪，有一百头怀了小猪，到下个月就该下小猪了。按一窝生六、七个计算，就是七百多头猪，到1959年底，将要繁殖到二千多头。他们队一千八百多亩田，平均一亩田一口多猪。一头猪每个月积三车粪，一年积三十六车，就是五万四千斤。仅仅养猪就可以供应他们队所需的肥料。
    那时候，太阳已升得老高，运肥的队伍已经沿着村边的大道往地里送了二十几趟粪了。姑娘们和男子一样，挑起满满两筐粪就走。从阜平王快水库回来过春节的几十个小伙子，在姑娘们眼前岂肯认输，挑起粪来，两脚如飞一样，边唱边挑，边挑边唱。棉衣热得穿不住了，只穿一身单衫裤，愈发显得精神。那边大车队出动了。领头的是城关中心商店来支援积肥的三辆大车，紧跟着的是木业合作社的两辆，后面跟着队里的三辆；最后面，十三岁的张富和四五个同年纪的孩子拉着一辆胶皮轮车，飞快地跟着。手推小车队紧跟着也来了。这一行运肥的队伍，在初春的阳光下一面闹嚷嚷地往田间运动着，一面把粪肥撒在正在分蘖的茁壮的小麦上。这里今年要争取每亩一千斤的产量！
    远处，一片烟云笼罩着村庄和树木，这是别的村庄在把肥堆熏起。
    现在，在全中国该是有多少人在为大地母亲安排盛宴！去年，几亿亩土地经过深翻，千万条水流流进田野。大地敞开被束缚了几千年的胸怀，自由地呼吸，贪婪地喝着清水。如今，它躺在春风的怀抱里，正在等待着人们给它准备的筵席。它给予人们的将是人们给予它的十倍、百倍！
