　　Glory, Screw
　　By Our Correspondent Xu Fangyi

　　A purchasing agent from the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station, carrying a letter of introduction from the construction site's Party committee, arrived in Shanghai, covered in dust, seeking urgent support. The letter listed not hoists, motors, cranes... or other important machines, but screws—screws for an iron suspension bridge spanning the Xin'anjiang River.

　　People say "to play the role of a screw," meaning that screws are ordinary, small things, but also indispensable. However, to those who manufacture complete machines and build new factories, the significance of screws far exceeds the meaning contained in that phrase. Screws, essential to all kinds of machinery and equipment, are not only needed in vast quantities but also in complex varieties. In Shanghai alone, over one hundred and forty factories with nearly ten thousand workers specialize in the production of screws.

　　During the Great Leap Forward last year, large numbers of blast furnaces, converters, and rolling mills were manufactured across the country, and tens of thousands of factories, mines, and power stations were built. To ensure that not a single screw was missing, the workers in these hundred-plus factories, like those in the machine-building factories, launched mass movements and technical revolutions, producing 7.4 billion screws. These included large screw caps weighing up to a ton, tiny screws thinner than matchsticks weighing less than an ounce, screws longer than people, and high-grade screws with a precision of less than one-seventh the thickness of a hair… encompassing over two thousand different types and specifications.

　　Screws, in a complete machine, are sometimes easily overlooked, only to be discovered missing when the machine is being assembled. Some machines also require oddly shaped, special screws. Shanghai's hundred-plus screw factories never shirk their responsibility for these urgent and special requests. Once, the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant needed a batch of "U" shaped screws for iron ladle cars. These screws were three inches in diameter and two feet long, and the Shanghai screw factories had never made them before. However, the workers were not afraid of difficulties, they built new large stoves themselves, wielded hammers as thick as thermos bottles, and took turns in shifts of five or six, finally hammering them out. Not long ago, a rolling mill was shipped in from another region, and it was discovered that a screw cap was missing. A call was made to the screw company, and technical personnel went to the site to measure, design, and manufacture it. This screw cap was no simple matter, weighing a full thousand kilograms.

　　As the new year begins, the workers of the Shanghai Screw Factory are advancing towards higher, more precise, and larger-scale mechanical industries with even greater drive and dedication, better playing the role of a screw.

    光荣，螺丝钉
    本报记者　徐方义
    一位来自新安江水电站的采购人员，手持工地党委介绍信，风尘仆仆地来到上海的一家工业公司，要求紧急支援。介绍信上开列的，不是卷扬机、电动机、吊车……等等重要的机器，只不过是螺丝——一种用于横跨新安江上空的铁索桥的螺丝。
    人们说“起一个螺丝钉的作用”，意思是说螺丝钉是个平凡的小东西，但又是必不可少的东西。但对制造成套机器的人、建设新工厂的人看来，螺丝钉的意义，远远超过这句话所包含的意思。螺丝，这个各种机器设备不可缺少的东西，不仅需要数量庞大，而且品种复杂。上海全市有一百四十多家工厂、近万职工专门生产螺丝。
    在去年大跃进中，全国各地制造出大量的高炉、转炉、轧钢机，建设起千万个工厂、矿山、电站。为了保证不缺一颗螺丝，这一百多家工厂的职工们像制造机器的工厂一样，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，制造出七十四亿只螺丝。其中有重达一吨的大螺丝帽，也有不满一两的细如火柴杆的小螺丝，有比人还长的螺丝，也有精密度不超过一根头发丝的七分之一的高级螺丝……全部品种规格有两千多种。
    螺丝，在整套机器中，有时的确容易被忽视，等到机器装起来，才发现缺少几只螺丝。还有些机器，常常需要一些奇形怪状的特殊的螺丝。对于这些紧急的、特殊的要求，上海一百多家螺丝工厂的工人们从不推卸自己的责任。有一次，上钢一厂需要一批铁水包子上用的“Ｕ”型螺丝。这种螺丝直径有三寸粗，长达二尺，上海的螺丝工厂都没有做过。但是，工人们不怕困难，自己砌了新的大炉灶，挥舞着像热水瓶般粗大的鎯头，五、六人轮番敲打，终于敲了出来。不久以前，从外地运到一套轧钢机，发现缺了一只螺丝帽。电话打到螺丝公司，技术人员就到现场去测绘，进行设计制造。这只螺丝帽很不简单，单重量就有一千公斤。
    上海螺丝厂的工人们，在新春伊始，正以更大的干劲和钻劲，配合机械工业向高级、精密、大型进军，更好地起一个螺丝钉的作用。
