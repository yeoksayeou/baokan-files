    "Merging" and "Dispersing"
    Qin Li
    It is very appropriate that "Opera Research" and "Drama Essays" have been merged and renamed "Drama Research" this year. In fact, readers have long felt inconvenienced by this. Think about it, the content of the two publications was originally very similar, and sometimes even the titles were unavoidably repeated. Why disperse the forces like this? Besides, doesn't it also increase the burden on readers?
    Now it's better, the strength is concentrated, and the quality of the publication will inevitably continue to be improved and enhanced as a result.
    However, the approaches are not all the same. Some publications currently seem to be dividing into finer areas, and there are also calls for this. For example, someone in the "Wenhui Daily" on January 23rd suggested that since the Beijing and Changchun Film Studios already have publications for publishing film literary scripts, "Film Creation" and "Film Literature" respectively, the Shanghai Film Studio should also publish one.
    I don't think it is necessary. Please think, now that each province has film studios, and some also want to shoot feature films, if we follow this logic, I am afraid that every province will have a film publication.
    In fact, film publications such as "China Film" publish film literary scripts in each issue, and film literary creations are also published in general literary publications. Is it really necessary to have so many specialized publications for film literary scripts?
    As a literary form, film literary scripts, if they can be published in general literary publications, I think it will also make literary publications appear richer and more colorful. If there are so many film scripts that it is necessary to create a specialized publication, could you please consider the readers more and not publish them in such a dispersed way?

    “合并”和“分散”
    秦犁
    “戏曲研究”与“戏剧论丛”自今年起合并改名为“戏剧研究”了，这是很合适的。其实读者对此早已感到不便，想一想，两本刊物的内容本来极为相似，有时甚至连题目也难避免重复，为什么要如此分散力量呢？再说，不也给读者增加了一份负担吗？
    现在好了，力量集中了，刊物的质量也一定会因此而不断得到改进和提高。
    然而做法不尽相同，目前有的刊物似乎还在往细处分，而且也有这样的呼声，如1月23日“文汇报”上就有人提出：北京、长春电影制片厂都分别有了发表电影文学剧本的刊物“电影创作”和“电影文学”，上海电影制片厂也应该出版一本才是。
    我倒觉得不必如此。请想，现在各省都有了电影制片厂，有的也要拍故事片，这样要求下去，恐怕每省都要有一本电影刊物了。
    其实，电影刊物如“中国电影”每期都要刊登电影文学剧本，一般文艺刊物上也都发表电影文学创作，难道非要那么多的专门刊载电影文学剧本的刊物吗？
    作为文学样式一种的电影文学剧本，如果能在一般文艺刊物上发表，我想也会使文艺刊物显得更丰富多采。若是电影剧本多得有必要来创办专门刊物的话，能不能多为读者考虑一下，不要这样分散的出版呢？
