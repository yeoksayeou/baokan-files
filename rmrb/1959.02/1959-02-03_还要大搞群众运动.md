Continue to Vigorously Launch Mass Movements
Zhang Ke

An important experience in leading industrial and agricultural production in various regions in 1958 was to vigorously launch mass movements. This experience should be adhered to and carried forward. This year, on the one hand, we must try to absorb all the advantages of organizing "large-scale operations" last year; on the other hand, we must lead and organize the scattered activities of the broad masses even better.

As far as the current winter production is concerned, the content is both numerous and complex. Some require temporary shock tactics, some require a steady and continuous effort; some require concentration, and some require dispersion. Therefore, we must organize and mobilize the teams according to the specific circumstances of various productions. On the one hand, organize professional teams to work steadily and surely, and on the other hand, temporarily assemble mobile forces for shock work; ensure that some tasks that require certain skills and a long time are managed by full-time personnel, and also ensure that tasks that require temporary shock work are completed in a timely manner.

In terms of "tactics," we should also conduct further scientific analysis. Taking field management as an example, we cannot be satisfied with the old experience of simply "heavy application of manure and frequent watering," but must determine the central content of each period based on the growth of crops and take corresponding measures. Since the emergence of wheat seedlings, Guanghua County, Hubei Province, has arranged three "teams" for wheat fields, each time determining a central content for key offensive. The first time was to ensure full stands, mobilizing the masses to replant all the more than 100,000 mu of wheat fields with missing seedlings and broken rows. The second time, it was discovered that some wheat fields were yellowing due to insufficient base fertilizer, so labor was organized to monitor the seedlings and top-dress with water and fertilizer, eliminating all yellow seedlings. Now, we are stepping up top-dressing to promote effective tillering of wheat. Many communes in Nanchong Prefecture, Sichuan, apply different fertilizers in stages according to the needs of different growth stages of wheat; they organize the masses to concentrate their efforts on one main aspect at a certain period. Currently, they are focusing on applying "ear-promoting fertilizer" mainly composed of potassium fertilizer, and in the future, they will also apply "grain-promoting fertilizer" mainly composed of nitrogen fertilizer.

Doing so will not only have the momentum of a mass movement, but also a relatively clear system of responsibility; not only a main direction of attack, but also full-line coordination; it will certainly achieve better and greater results faster.

    还要大搞群众运动
    张克
    1958年各地领导工农业生产的一条重要经验，就是大搞群众运动。这条经验应该坚持下去，发扬光大。今年，一方面要尽量吸取去年组织“大兵团作战”中的一切优点；另一方面，还要把广大群众的分散活动，领导得更好，组织得更好。
    就目前的冬季生产来说，内容既多又复杂。有的需要临时突击，有的需要细水长流；有的需要集中，有的需要分散。因此，必须根据各种生产的具体情况来组织和调动队伍。一方面组织专业队稳扎稳打，一方面临时调集机动力量进行突击；既保证某些需要有一定技术而且时间较长的任务有人专职管理，又保证需要临时突击的任务及时完成。
    在“战术”上，也应当更进一步进行科学分析。拿田间管理来说，就不能满足于简单的“粪大水勤”的老经验，而必须根据农作物生长情况，确定每一时期的中心内容，采取相应的措施。湖北光化县从麦苗出土到现在，把麦田排了三次队，每次都确定一个中心内容，重点进攻。第一次是保证全苗，发动群众将缺苗断垄的十万多亩麦地全部补齐。第二次发现有些麦田因底肥不足，麦苗发黄，就组织劳力看苗追水肥，全部消灭黄苗。现在又抓紧追肥，促使小麦有效分蘖。四川南充专区许多公社根据小麦不同生长阶段的需要，分期追施不同肥料；组织群众在一定时期集中力量进攻一个主要方面。现在正以钾肥为主追施“攻穗肥”，将来还要以氮肥为主追施“攻粒肥”。
    这样做，既有群众运动的声势，又有比较明确的责任制；既有主攻方向，又有全线配合；一定能更快地取得更好更大的战果。
