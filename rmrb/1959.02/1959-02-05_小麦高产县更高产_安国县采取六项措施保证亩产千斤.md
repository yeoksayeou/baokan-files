    Wheat High-Yield County Achieves Even Higher Yields
    Anguo County Takes Six Measures to Guarantee Per-Mu Yield of 1,000 Jin

    This dispatch from Tianjin on February 4th reports that cadres and masses in Anguo County, Hebei Province, are striving with soaring enthusiasm and meticulous, practical work to realize the goal of becoming a "1,000-jin wheat county."

    Last autumn, Anguo County planted over 356,000 mu of wheat, accounting for over 70% of the county's planned grain acreage this year, an increase of over 50,000 mu compared to last year. The plan is to produce 1,000 jin per mu, striving for 1,500 jin.

    In order to hold high the red flag of high wheat yields, Anguo County, from top to bottom, has been full of energy since the deep plowing and wheat planting last autumn, and has formulated and implemented a series of advanced measures. These measures are: First, focus on large-area high-yield fields and eliminate third-class seedlings to promote an overall bumper wheat harvest. The county has selected 120,100 mu of contiguous land with good soil and sufficient water and fertilizer as high-yield wheat fields, and has also equipped them with strong leading cadres to strengthen management. The planned yield per mu of these high-yield fields is to exceed that of ordinary wheat fields by more than double. People's communes are also paying close attention to the management of ordinary wheat fields, especially by regularly checking the growth of wheat seedlings and strengthening the biased irrigation and fertilization management of third-class seedlings, so that all wheat seedlings grow vigorously. Second, establish professional teams and strengthen the system of responsibility for production labor. In the area of large-area high-yield fields, the county has organized eight combat battalions, divided into companies, platoons, and squads, with more than 20,000 fighters, averaging six mu of wheat field management per person. It has also vigorously promoted the "three guarantees" (company guarantees the area, platoon guarantees the plot, person guarantees the ridge), "five to the fields" (measures, leadership taking the lead, professional companies, technical research and learning to the fields), and "six determinations" (determine yield, measures, investment, time, task, and quality). The professional team in the high-yield fields of the Xianfeng People's Commune has also formulated different operating procedures for topdressing, watering, and harrowing according to the developmental stage of the wheat at various times. For the management of ordinary wheat fields, each production team of the communes has also assigned dedicated personnel for fixed management. This improves the quality of farm work. Third, people's communes, management districts, and production teams have all appropriately divided their scope of authority, thereby stimulating the labor enthusiasm of production teams and commune members. When Yucun Township's Hongqi Commune's Qicun Management District started topdressing wheat, the management district relied on the commune, and the production teams and commune members waited for the management district, due to unclear responsibilities, which affected the wheat field management work. After the scope of authority was divided, the topdressing of all high-yield fields was completed within three days. Fourth, from the commune to the team to the commune members, a system of competition, evaluation, and inspection has been formulated and adhered to, carrying out a labor competition movement in which teams compete for red flags and everyone compares to be advanced. All eight communes in the county have thirty-two mobile red flags, generally with inspections every seven days, evaluations every half month, and summaries every month, so that the high tide of wheat management in the county rises one after another. In addition, the contract production system has been universally implemented, stipulating the conditions for management districts, production teams, and individual commune members to be rewarded for exceeding production targets. Fifth, the establishment of a quota attendance system effectively improved work efficiency and the quality of farm work. In the Liu Zhuang Management District of the Xianfeng People's Commune, because the above methods were implemented in the wheat topdressing activity, 112 commune members covered more than 1,000 mu of wheat fields with fertilizer in one week, increasing the fertilizer application efficiency per person per day by 40% compared with the original. Sixth, from the county to the grassroots, Party committee secretaries at all levels took the lead in establishing a wheat leadership front, greatly leveraging the core leading role of the Party. The first secretary of the Party committee and four Party branch secretaries of the Xianfeng People's Commune personally led eighteen experienced farmers and technical cadres to establish a Wheat Management Technical Committee.

    Due to the adoption of the above measures, all the operations of wheat in the county since sowing have achieved great results. According to inspections, the wheat in the county has been deeply ploughed, heavily fertilized with base fertilizer, and densely planted. Except for more than 6,000 mu of wheat that were planted late, all the remaining wheat was sown in a timely manner before the Frost's Descent solar term. Because of the two topdressings and two waterings, the wheat growth and tillering have been greatly promoted, and the root system of the wheat is well developed.

    Currently, the county's first-class seedlings have increased from the original 100,500 mu to 168,000 mu, and third-class seedlings have decreased from more than 82,000 mu to more than 20,000 mu. The county also has 110,000 people, 10,000 head of livestock, and 6,000 rubber-tired carts, engaged in a vigorous movement to accumulate fertilizer, produce fertilizer, and deliver manure. Before the Spring Festival, it is planned to accumulate 3.4 billion jin of coarse fertilizer, produce 100 million jin of locally produced chemical fertilizer, and deliver 1 billion jin of manure to the fields, first ensuring that all wheat fields are covered with an average of 20,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, so that the wheat is not subject to cold damage. More than 2,500 laborers are rushing to drill machine wells to realize the mechanization of wheat field irrigation.

### 小麦高产县更高产  安国县采取六项措施保证亩产千斤

    小麦高产县更高产
    安国县采取六项措施保证亩产千斤
    本报天津4日电　河北省安国县的干部群众，正以冲天的干劲和细致切实的工作，力争实现小麦千斤县。
    安国县去年秋后播种小麦三十五万六千多亩，占今年全县粮食计划播种面积的70％以上，比去年扩大面积五万多亩；计划每亩产一千斤，争取一千五百斤。
    为了高举小麦高产红旗，安国县从上到下，从去秋深翻种麦时起，就干劲十足，并且制订和执行了一系列的先进措施。这些措施是，首先抓大面积高产田和消灭三类苗，促使小麦全面丰收。全县已选择土壤好，水源、肥料充足的连片地十二万零一百亩为小麦高产田，同时配备有较强的领导骨干来加强管理。高产田计划亩产量要超过一般麦田的二倍以上。各人民公社对一般麦田抓的也很紧，特别是注意定期检查麦苗的生长情况，加强对三类苗进行偏水偏肥的管理，使全部麦苗普遍生长茁壮。其次，建立专业队伍，加强生产劳动责任制。在大面积高产田方面，全县共组织了八个战斗营，下设连、排、班，战斗员二万多人，平均每人管理六亩麦田。并且大力推行了“三包”（连包方、排包块、人包畦）、“五到田”（措施、领导挂帅、专业连队、技术研究和学习到田）、“六定”（定产量、措施、投资、时间、任务和质量）。先锋人民公社高产田的专业队，还根据各个时期小麦的发育情况，制订了追肥、浇水、轧耙等不同的操作规程。对一般麦田的管理，各公社生产队，也确定了专人固定管理。这样，提高了农活的质量。再次，各人民公社、管理区、生产队都适当划分了职权范围，从而激发了生产队和社员的劳动积极性。淤村乡红旗公社齐村管理区，在开始进行小麦追肥时，由于职权不明，管理区依赖公社，生产队和社员等待管理区，使麦田管理工作受到了影响。职权范围已经划分，在三天内就完成了全部高产田的追肥任务。第四，从公社到队到社员，都制订和坚持了竞赛评比检查制度，开展了队队争红旗，人人比先进的劳动竞赛运动。全县八个公社，共有三十二面流动红旗，一般是七天一检查，半月一评比，一月一总结，从而使全县小麦管理高潮一个接一个。另外，普遍推行包产制度，规定了管理区、生产队和社员个人超产奖励的条件。第五，建立定额考勤制度，有效地提高了工作效率和农活质量。先锋人民公社刘庄管理区，在小麦盖肥活动中，由于实行了以上办法，一百一十二名社员在一周内就把一千多亩麦田盖上了肥，每人每天的盖肥工效比原来提高40％。第六，从县到基层，层层由党委书记挂帅，建立了小麦领导战线，大大发挥了党的核心领导作用。先锋人民公社的党委第一书记和四名党总支书记，亲自领导十八个老农和技术干部，成立了小麦管理技术委员会。
    由于采取上述措施，全县小麦从播种以来的样样作业，都取得了很大的成绩。据检查，全县小麦作到深翻、多施底肥和密植。除有六千多亩小麦播种较晚外，其余小麦全部在霜降节以前适时播种。因为两次追肥和两次浇水，大大促使了小麦生长健壮和分蘖，小麦的根系发育良好。
    目前，全县一类苗已由原来十万零五百亩增为十六万八千亩，三类苗由八万二千多亩下降到二万多亩。全县还有十一万人、一万头牲口和六千辆胶轮大车，投入了大搞积肥、造肥、送粪的运动。春节前计划积粗肥三十四亿斤，制土化肥一亿斤，送粪到地十亿斤，首先保证全部麦田平均每亩盖肥二万斤，让小麦不受寒冻的侵袭。有二千五百多个劳力正在赶打机井，实现麦田灌溉机井化。
