    Breaking Through the Kunlun Mountains to Find Water Sources

    The Most Arid Place in the Country

    Ruoqiang County, located at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains in southern Xinjiang, has over one million mu of arable wasteland and two million mu of grassland suitable for irrigation and cultivation, holding great potential for the development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. There's just one major drawback: a severe shortage of water. The area lacks rain in the summer and snow in the winter, with an annual rainfall of only 3.7 millimeters.

    Looking at the map, both the Tarim River and the Peacock River flow towards Ruoqiang. However, these inland rivers become increasingly narrow as they flow, disappearing into the desert after traversing hundreds of miles. Even the rare floods are blocked by Lop Nur. In reality, the irrigation of Ruoqiang's land relies on three small rivers originating from the Altyn-Tagh range, a branch of the Kunlun Mountains: the Ruoqiang River, the Wash River, and the Milan River. These three rivers have limited flow, with a combined constant irrigable flow of only 3.5 cubic meters per second, irrigating a total of over 36,000 mu of farmland.

    In Ruoqiang, the Uyghur farmers value water as much as life itself. They say, "Land is the mother, water is the father." Because of the lack of water for planting protective forest belts, a desert heatwave can wither the lush wheat seedlings. Because of the lack of water, the expansion of arable land is severely limited, and grain yields per unit area rarely exceed 200 jin. Because of the lack of water for cultivating grasslands, Ruoqiang County's growing livestock population has to borrow pastures from Yuli County and Qiemo County.

    "Ruoqiang's land is fertile, but it has always been short of water." Generations of Uyghur farmers have lamented this. For thousands of years, they have pinned their hopes on the towering Kunlun Mountains. Every year before spring plowing, farmers slaughter cattle and sheep to pray for water from the Kunlun Mountains.

    Poverty Spurs Change

    To help Ruoqiang find sufficient water sources and alleviate the threat of drought, water conservancy surveyors entered the Kunlun Mountains twice in 1954 and 1956 to investigate water sources, but both times they had to turn back due to heavy snow and the thin air at high altitudes. As a result, some discouraged individuals said: The Kunlun Mountains are just that kind of mountain; "Those who enter cannot leave, and those who leave do not enter."

    With the explorations for water sources in the Kunlun Mountains proving fruitless, the Ruoqiang County Party Committee and government launched a mass campaign to fight drought by digging wells. In 1957, farmers found underground water that had seeped from the riverbed at a depth of more than ten meters. However, the riverbed had dried up, and the well water would dry up after a few buckets were drawn. The water drawn up was not even enough to sprinkle the ground. Thus, people naturally refocused their attention on the Kunlun Mountains: "Is it really impossible to conquer the Kunlun Mountains?" "Are there actually usable water sources in the Kunlun Mountains?"

    During last year's Great Leap Forward in agriculture, the Party and government leaders of Ruoqiang County were anxious about this issue day and night. Xu Fangyuan, Secretary of the Ruoqiang County Party Committee, and Yimin Azi (Uyghur), the County Head, visited villages to interview hunters and shepherds who had been in the Kunlun Mountains. As a result, they gained a clearer understanding that the upper reaches of the Ruoqiang River originated from a large snow-capped mountain over 6,000 meters high, which the local Uyghur farmers called "Akekartag" (White Snow Mountain). This White Snow Mountain is 600 li away from Ruoqiang. The journey is treacherous, the air is thin, and few people have ever been there.

    An old hunter named Mule Tuohuti Maide·Kasimu told County Head Yimin Azi that he had visited the foot of this snow mountain when he was young and remembered that the water flow on the mountain was very strong. Another hunter, Shadeke, had seen two large streams disappear inside the Kunlun Mountains. He said that as long as the hills blocking these two streams were cleared, the source of the Ruoqiang River would increase several times. During the interviews, the farmers expressed boundless hope for the water of the Kunlun Mountains. "As long as the Party and the government lead us, we can conquer the water of the Kunlun Mountains." Mule Tuohuti Maide·Kasimu, who was already over seventy years old, was the first to request to lead the way up the mountain to survey the water source of the Ruoqiang River.

    Breaking Through the Snow Mountain to Find Water Sources

    It seemed that this "White Snow Mountain" was the lifeline of Ruoqiang County. Therefore, the Ruoqiang County Party Committee decided to organize a large team to find water sources, led by County Party Secretary Xu Fangyuan, setting off upstream along the Ruoqiang River towards the snow mountain in late May.

    At this time, the fields in Ruoqiang were already blooming with spring flowers, but the water-seeking team was wearing sheepskin coats and walking in the roadless Kunlun Mountain valleys. Sometimes the valleys were narrow and the streams were rapid, so people had to climb over the steep hillsides. When they were hungry, they ate some of the dried food they had brought with them. When it was dark and they couldn't see the way, they set up tents in the desolate mountains and spent the nights in temperatures below zero. With the determination not to give up until they reached the Yellow River, they paid no attention to the wind, snow, cold, and hunger along the way.

    After eleven days of marching, they approached the towering snow mountain. The air was thin at high altitude, and everyone found it difficult to breathe. However, as long as they thought of the eyes of over six thousand people in Ruoqiang County, who were eagerly awaiting the news of their success with hope in their eyes, they were even more encouraged to move forward with a hundredfold of courage.

    "We are doing something that no one in Ruoqiang has ever done before." County Party Secretary Xu Fangyuan constantly encouraged all the team members whenever they faced difficulties, overcame various obstacles, and finally led a team of more than thirty people to the "White Snow Mountain."

    They traveled more than a thousand li to and fro, and after a month of surveying, they finally identified the rich water source of the snow mountain and found a way to extract the water. It turned out that the upper reaches of the Ruoqiang River were a glacier. The water from the melting glacier was abundant, but the mountains were full of gravel and Gobi Desert, and the snow water all seeped into the ground and disappeared after flowing for 20 li. A small portion of it turned into springs that flowed out of the ground, which is the current Ruoqiang River. As long as we find a way to block the scattered snow water, lay a 36-li artificial channel to prevent leakage, Ruoqiang can increase more than ten cubic meters per second of water, and the county's arable land area can be doubled compared to the current one.

    When this news spread throughout Ruoqiang County, the farmers were ecstatic. Holding high the banner of "riding the wind and waves, transforming nature," they sang enthusiastically: "We will turn the snow mountains into fertile fields, we will turn the yellow earth into gold. With the leadership of the Communist Party, there is no difficulty we cannot conquer." A water conservancy army of over three hundred people in the county marched towards the snow mountain.

    Building Canals and Dams Before the Snow Mountain

    There were only 2,800 male and female laborers in Ruoqiang County, and all of the more than 300 people who signed up and were approved to go up the mountain were young and middle-aged men and women. Among them were blacksmiths, carpenters, water conservancy workers, cooks, and people from all walks of life. All the grain and fodder were carried by more than 700 donkeys.

    According to the engineering design, permanent projects such as a river-blocking dam, a spillway dam, a spillway channel, an intake gate, a diversion canal, a water delivery canal, and a sand discharge gate were to be built on the north side of the snow mountain. Among them, pivotal projects such as the intake gate and the sand discharge gate were located at an altitude of more than 5,000 meters above sea level and were all built of reinforced concrete. The sand discharge gate was also equipped with an automatic opening and closing machine, which could automatically discharge the sand and gravel in front of the gate to the spillway channel.

    After marching 600 li along the way, the water conservancy army began constructing canals and dams on the same day they arrived in front of the snow mountain.

    Building canals and dams on such a high snow mountain was very difficult. There was only one water conservancy engineer and one intern on the construction site, and the technical force was seriously insufficient, so the masses learned as they worked. Without a meter stick, they used willow branches as a meter stick. Without a tripod, willow branches were used to build a tripod. The gradient of the high-mountain stream was large, so dry rubble masonry was changed to dry stone masonry, and the method of increasing the flow rate was used to prevent leakage. Originally, the spillway channel designed by the water conservancy engineer required digging 12,150 cubic meters of stone. After the farmers suggested using the high-mountain water power to excavate the spillway channel, the stone excavation was reduced to 1,749 cubic meters.

    Soaring Morale

    The farmers of Ruoqiang demonstrated unparalleled heroism in building canals and dams on the high mountains. There was no firewood to burn on the snow mountain, so they went 40 li away to pull red willow branches to burn. The air pressure was low and the rice could not be cooked thoroughly, and the noodles were sticky, but they still went to work. They ran out of food for three days, so the farmers hunted wild cattle and wild sheep and cooked feed to fill their hunger.

    Even more serious was the thin air at high altitudes, which made breathing difficult. But the farmers were not afraid of any difficulties for their better lives. They challenged each other, they competed with each other. Once, a touching thing happened. A young man named Abudula, because of his poor heart condition, did not think about eating on the high mountain. The leader advised him to rest, but he did not listen and often worked secretly. Finally, County Party Secretary Xu Fangyuan ordered him to return to Ruoqiang. He took dry food and walked forward for 30 li, stayed for three days, and then returned. Abudula was thinking like this: "No, if the project is not completed, I will not go home even if I die. If I don't get the water, what face will I have to see my parents?"

    Women Wugulihan, Rouzihan, and Hailiqihan originally came to the mountain to cook, but they also participated in the labor of carrying stones and challenged the young men to compete. The stone diggers saw Wugulihan carrying dry rubble masonry and only put some small stones for her. She shook them off angrily, picked up a large stone weighing more than 80 jin, and walked away. Examples like this were endless. During their breaks, they talked about the beautiful scenery of Ruoqiang County becoming a rice-producing area, and the songs of "The Communist Party, Mao Zedong, you are even closer to us than our own parents" rose one after another.

    When the strong wind rolled snowflakes all over the Kunlun Mountains, when the temperature dropped to more than ten degrees below zero at night, the farmers left behind in Ruoqiang County brought a large number of cotton clothes, felt tubes, leather coats, and other cold-proof supplies, and told them the victorious news of completing the summer harvest and autumn planting tasks ahead of schedule. The canal-building farmers were deeply moved and their morale was high. They still insisted on fighting against the wind, snow, and severe cold. They said, "The cold can pierce our flesh, the glacier can freeze our hands and feet, but our determination cannot be defeated by anything." They also brought a stone after work, and at night, they secretly carried stones to build the canal behind the leaders' backs.

    After three months of hard work, the water conservancy army of more than three hundred people excavated 46,090 cubic meters of stone, dug 19 li of diversion canal, of which 10 li were dry rubble masonry, and successfully completed the first phase of the project.

    Seeing that the heavy snow was about to block the return road, they returned to Ruoqiang to prepare for the full completion of this arduous water conservancy project in 1959, bringing the abundant water source to the arid Ruoqiang.

    踏破昆仑找水源
    本报记者　杨克现
    全国最干旱的地方
    新疆南部昆仑山下的婼羌县，可耕荒地有一百多万亩，可以灌溉培植的草原有两百万亩，农业、林业、畜牧业的发展前途很大。就是有一样不如意：严重地缺水。这里夏季缺雨，冬季缺雪，一年降雨量只有三点七公厘。
    从地图上看，塔里木河和孔雀河都向婼羌流来。但是，这些内陆河都是越流越细，在流经千百里以后，便在沙漠中消失了，就是有极少的洪水也被阻挡到罗布泊去了。实际上灌溉婼羌土地的是三条发源于昆仑山支脉阿尔金山的小河，婼羌河、瓦石河和米兰河。这三条河的流量都不大，经常能够灌溉的水量只有三个半秒公方，共灌溉了三万六千多亩农田。
    在婼羌、维吾尔农民把水看得像生命一样宝贵。他们说：“地是母亲、水是父亲”。因为缺水种植防护林带，一场沙漠热风便会把绿油油的麦苗吹得枯焦。因为缺水，扩大耕地面积大受限制，而粮食单位面积产量很难超过二百斤。因为缺水培植草原，婼羌县日益发展的牲畜便不得不借用尉犁县和且末县的草场。
    “婼羌土地肥，自古就缺水”。世世代代的维吾尔族农民没有不为此感叹的。千百年来，他们把希望寄托在高大的昆仑山上，每年春耕前，农民总要宰牛宰羊，向昆仑山求水。
      穷则思变
    为了帮助婼羌找寻足够的水源，解除干旱对人们的威胁，水利勘察人员曾经在1954年和1956年两次进入昆仑山调查水源，但都因为风雪交加和高山氧气稀薄，中途返回。因此，一些泄气的人说：昆仑山就是这样的山，“进山出不了山，出山不进山”。
    到昆仑山探索水源没有结果，婼羌县党政便发动全民打井抗旱，1957年，农民在十多公尺深的地下找到了河床渗下去的地下水，可是河床干涸了，井水吊上几桶也就干涸了。吊上来的水还不够洒水扫地。于是，人们自然地又把注意力集中到昆仑山上：“难道真的征服不了昆仑山吗？”“昆仑山上究竟有没有可资利用的水源？”
    去年农业大跃进，婼羌县的党政领导为着这个问题日夜焦虑不安。中共婼羌县委书记许芳元和县长伊敏阿孜（维吾尔族）为此遍访农村，只要是曾经进过昆仑山的猎人、牧羊人都不放过。访问的结果，这才比较清楚地了解到婼羌河的上源是一座高达六千多公尺的大雪山，当地维吾尔族农民叫它“阿克卡尔塔格”（白雪山）。这个白雪山离开婼羌有六百华里，沿途山势险峻、空气稀薄，很少有人进去过。
    有个白发苍苍的老猎人姆勒托乎提买德·卡思木向伊敏阿孜县长谈到他年轻时曾到过这座雪山下，记得山上水势很大，而另外一个猎手沙的克曾经见过有两条大水在昆仑山内消失了，他说，只要劈开挡住这两条大水的山丘，婼羌河源便增大几倍。访问中，农民对于昆仑山水抱着无限的希望。“只要党和政府领导我们干，昆仑山水没有拿不下来的”。姆勒托乎提买德·卡思木已经七十多岁了，他第一个要求带路上山勘察婼羌河的水源。
    踏破雪山找水源
    看来，这座“白雪山”就是婼羌县的生命线了。于是，中共婼羌县委员会决定由县委书记许芳元挂帅，组织一支寻找水源的大队，5月下旬溯婼羌河而上向雪山进发。
    这时节，婼羌的田野已经是春暖花开的季节，找水的队伍却穿着羊皮大衣，走在没有路的昆仑山谷中。有时山谷窄狭、流水湍急，人们就从突兀的半山坡爬过去。他们饿了，就吃些带来的干粮；天黑看不见方向，他们就在荒无人烟的深山撑起帐篷，度过零度以下的夜晚。他们抱着不到黄河心不甘的决心，对沿途的风雪、寒冷、饥饿全不在意。
    经过了十一天的行军，他们接近了巍峨的雪山，高山空气稀薄，呼吸普遍感到困难。但是，只要想起婼羌全县六千多人渴望昆仑山水的眼睛正期待着他们胜利的消息，就更加勇气百倍地前进了。
      “我们正在做着婼羌前人从来没有作过的事情。”县委书记许芳元在每个困难当头，便不断地鼓励着全队人员，克服了各种困难，终于率领全队三十多个人到达了“白雪山”。
    他们连来带去，行程一千多里路，经过一个月的踏勘，终于探明了雪山丰富的水源和找到了取水的方法。原来，婼羌河的上源是一条冰河，冰河融解后的流水很大，只是山中全是砾石戈壁，雪水在流过二十里路以后，就全部渗入地下消失了。其中一少部分变为泉水流出地面，便是现在的婼羌河。只要设法拦住流散的雪水，铺设三十六华里的人工渠道，防止渗漏，婼羌便可增加十多个秒公方水，全县耕地面积可以比现在的扩大两倍。
    当这个消息传遍婼羌全县的时候，农民们沸腾起来了。他们高举着“乘风破浪、改造自然”的大旗，热情洋溢地唱着：“要让雪山变良田，要让黄土变金钱，共产党领导我们干，没有征服不了的困难”。全县组成一支三百多人的水利大军向雪山进发了。
  修渠筑坝雪山前
    婼羌全县男女劳动力只有二千八百人，报名批准进山的三百多人全都是青壮年男女。他们之中有铁匠、木匠、水利员、炊事员等各行各业的人，全部粮秣由七百多头毛驴驮运着。
    按照工程设计，是要在雪山北面修建起拦河坝、溢洪坝、溢洪道、进水闸、引水渠、输水渠和排砂闸等永久性工程。其中像进水闸、排砂闸等枢纽性的工程，位于拔海五千多公尺处，全由钢筋混凝土筑成，排砂闸并装有自动启闭机，可自动地把闸前的砂石排至溢洪道。
    水利大军在经过沿途六百里路的行军，到达雪山前的当天，就开始了修渠筑坝的工作。
    在这样高的雪山上修渠筑坝，困难是很大的。工地上只有一个水利工程人员和一个实习生，技术力量严重不足，群众便边做边学。没有米尺，用柳条作米尺；没有三角架，柳枝架起了三角架。高山流水坡度大，干砌卵石改为干砌片石，运用加大流速的方法，防止渗漏。原来，水利工程人员设计的溢洪道需要挖石一万二千一百五十立方，经过农民提出建议，借高山水力开凿溢洪道，结果石方减少到一千七百四十九立方。
    高昂的士气
    婼羌农民在高山上修渠筑坝表现了无比的英雄气概。雪山上没有柴烧，他们到四十里外拉红柳枝烧火，气压低饭做不熟，面条粘牙也一样去劳动，曾经有三天断粮，农民便猎获野牛、野羊和煮饲料充饥。
    更严重的是高山空气稀薄，呼吸喘急。但是农民们为了自己美好的生活，什么困难也不怕，他们互相挑战，他们互相竞赛。曾经发生了这样一桩动人的事，有个叫做阿布都拉的青年，因为心脏条件差，在高山上不思饮食，领导劝他休息，他不听，经常悄悄干活。最后县委书记许芳元命令他返回婼羌。他带着干粮向前走了三十里，住了三天又返回来了，阿布都拉在这样想：“不行，工程不完，我死也不回家。没有拿下来水，有什么脸见父母。”
    妇女吾古力汗、柔孜汗和海力其罕本来是上山做饭的，她们也参加了背石头的劳动，向青年小伙子提出挑战比赛。挖石块的人看见吾古力汗背干砌的卵石，便给她只放一些小石头。她生气地抖落下来，说着背起一块八十多斤重的大石块就走。像这样的例子，层出不穷。他们在工暇之际，谈论着婼羌县变为稻米之乡的美景，“共产党、毛泽东，你比我们亲爹娘还要亲”的歌声此起彼落。
    当狂风卷着雪花飘遍昆仑山的时候，当夜晚气温下降到零下十多度的时候，婼羌县留在家里的农民捎来了大批棉衣毡筒、皮大衣等御寒物资，并告诉他们提前完成夏收和秋种任务的胜利消息。修渠的农民深受感动，士气高涨，他们依然坚持与风雪严寒作斗争。他们说：“寒冷能刺破我们的皮肉，冰河能冻木我们的手脚，我们的决心任何东西无法击退”。他们下工也捎一块石头，夜晚，还背着领导悄悄地背石头砌渠。
    经过三个月的苦战，三百多个人的水利大军挖石四万六千零九十立方，开凿引水渠十九华里，其中干砌卵石十华里，胜利地完成了第一期工程。
    眼看大雪就要封住归来的道路，他们才返回到婼羌，进行1959年全面完成这个艰巨的水利工程的准备工作，把丰富的水源引向干旱的婼羌。
