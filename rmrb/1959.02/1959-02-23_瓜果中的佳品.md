Fine Fruits and Melons
    Grapes
    Xinjiang grapes have been famous since ancient times. According to historical records, during the Han and Tang dynasties, Xinjiang grapes were transported to the interior as special products. Tang poems contain the line "Grapes enter the Han family," and the bronze mirrors cast at that time also used grape patterns as decoration. In the early fifteenth century, one pound of Xinjiang grapes could be exchanged for a bolt of silk in the interior. This shows how precious grapes were at that time.
    Xinjiang is the largest grape-producing area in China. Except for high-altitude mountainous areas and grasslands, vineyards of all sizes can be found everywhere in agricultural areas, with a total cultivation area of ​​more than 100,000 mu, accounting for more than 60% of the country's grape cultivation area.
    There are more than a dozen varieties of Xinjiang grapes, and the quality is good. They come in various colors such as bright red, rose, emerald green, light yellow, and milky white, and in various shapes such as one inch long, as big as pigeon eggs, and as small as sorghum rice. There are red grapes that are sweet and crisp, refreshing and delicious mare's milk grapes, and Soso grapes that look like red sorghum ears and can be used for medicinal purposes. There are also Kashgar grapes that can be stored for a long time through the winter without rotting. The most famous of these are the seedless white grapes from the Turpan Basin. The seedless white raisins that are dried are produced at an annual rate of 16 million catties and are sold far overseas as treasures.
    Hami Melon
    Hami melons, which are as famous as Turpan grapes, are the favorite food of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Just as grapes are not only produced in Turpan, Hami melons are not only produced in Hami. Hami melons are produced in large quantities throughout Xinjiang, and the Hami melons produced in Shanshan County in the Turpan Basin and Gashi County in southern Xinjiang taste the best. They are crisp and sweet, and only the Hami melons from Shanshan can be made into candied melon that is as sweet as honey.
    Xinjiang has nearly 300,000 mu of Hami melon cultivation area. Hami melon is a general name, and there are dozens of varieties. According to the season, there are summer melons and winter melons. The skin color includes white, yellow, yellow-green, and dark green, and some are densely covered with fine cracks. The melon flesh is from several fen to more than an inch thick, and there are various colors such as snow white, emerald green, orange yellow, and light red. The aromas are also diverse, some are crisp and sweet like pears, and some are soft, juicy, and melt into honey water when you eat them. Winter melons are harvested in the autumn after they are ripe and can be stored until the following spring. Moreover, the longer the storage time, the sweeter the taste of the melon.

    瓜果中的佳品
    葡萄
    新疆葡萄自古有名，根据历史记载，汉、唐时代，新疆葡萄就作为特产输送到内地，唐诗有“葡萄入汉家”，当时铸造的青铜镜子也用葡萄花纹图案作装饰。在十五世纪初叶，新疆的葡萄在内地一斤就可以换到一匹丝绢。可见当时葡萄的名贵。
    新疆是我国最大的葡萄产地。除了高寒山区和草原以外，农业区到处都有着大大小小的葡萄园，栽培面积共约十万多亩，占全国葡萄栽培面积的60％以上。
    新疆葡萄品种有十几种之多，而且质量好。有鲜红、玫瑰、碧绿、淡黄、乳白各种颜色，有长达一寸、大如鸽子蛋、小如高粱米等各种形状，有又甜又脆的红葡萄，清爽可口的马奶葡萄，长得和红高粱穗一样可作药用的索索葡萄，有可以长期贮藏过冬不烂的喀什噶尔葡萄，其中最著名的是吐鲁番盆地的无核白葡萄，晾制成的无核白葡萄干，年产达一千六百万斤，远销国外，被视为珍品。
    哈密瓜
    和吐鲁番葡萄齐名的哈密瓜，是新疆各族人民最喜爱的食品。正如葡萄并不仅仅产于吐鲁番一样，哈密瓜也不仅仅产于哈密。新疆各地都大量出产哈密瓜，而以吐鲁番盆地的鄯善县、南疆的伽师县等地出产的哈密瓜味道最好，又脆又甜，只有鄯善的哈密瓜可以制成甜腻如蜜的瓜干。
    新疆种植哈密瓜的面积近三十万亩。哈密瓜是总名称，品种有几十种之多。按时令分有夏瓜、冬瓜。皮色有白、黄、黄绿、墨绿等色，有的还密布着细密的裂纹，瓜肉有几分到一寸多厚，有雪白、碧绿、橘黄、淡红各色，香味也多种多样，有的脆甜如梨，有的松软多汁，入口就化成蜜水。冬瓜在秋季成熟后收摘，可以贮藏到来年春天，而且贮藏的时间愈长，瓜的味道愈香甜。（附图片）
