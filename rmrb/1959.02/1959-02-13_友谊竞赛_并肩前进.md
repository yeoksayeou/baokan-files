Sichuan—High-Yield Competition of the Same Crops Under the Same Conditions Spreads Throughout the Province
Jiangxi—Fuzhou Prefecture Competes, Evaluates, and Promotes Simultaneously
Fujian—Longxi Prefecture Strives for a Bumper Harvest with Mutual Competition

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu—A high-yield competition of the same crops under the same conditions is unfolding between counties and communes in Sichuan Province.

The high-yield competition of the same crops under the same conditions is a very good format adopted by the Party committees at all levels in Sichuan Province when using evaluation and competition methods to promote a production upsurge last year. Last year, in addition to the extensive use of this form of competition between townships and communes in various counties, Sichuan Province also launched competitions between counties in plains, hills, and mountainous areas, respectively. According to the situation of the seventeen counties participating in the competition, the crops of each county as competition projects last year mostly increased by more than double on the original basis, establishing red flags for large-area high yields of rice, cotton, and other crops, which played a considerable role in promoting the overall bumper harvest in the province.

This year, in order to strive for a bigger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, Party committees at all levels in Sichuan further use this successful experience to extensively organize a large-area high-yield movement. In early January, Pixian County on the western Sichuan Plain, which had an average grain yield of more than 3,160 jin per mu last year, first proposed a target for the average yield of rice and wheat per mu in the county this year to be even higher than last year, and challenged Xinfan County with roughly the same natural conditions. Then, Mabian County in the great mountainous area launched a grain production increase challenge to Fengjie County under the same conditions. Subsequently, Zhongxian County, which produced 231 jin of rapeseed per mu last year, issued a high-yield rapeseed challenge to counties producing rapeseed throughout the province. As a result, more than 20 counties in eastern Sichuan, western Sichuan, southern Sichuan, and northern Sichuan successively sent telegrams and letters, challenging and responding to each other; and a large part of the counties are still discussing and studying, preparing to challenge or respond. A competition upsurge striving for a greater leap forward is forming throughout the province.

Conducting competitions in areas with the same conditions, with both sides being evenly matched, makes it easier to establish the idea of striving for the best. Not only does the area initiating the challenge brew up, discuss, formulate plans, and find measures, inspiring full enthusiasm; but the county receiving the challenge letter also discusses questions such as "Dare to compete?" and "Can we win?" among the masses, equally spirited and full of fighting spirit. After receiving the challenge letter from Pixian County, Xinfan County not only did not want to be lower than Pixian County in terms of production increase targets, but also mobilized the masses to come up with measures that Pixian County had not mentioned. For example: while comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture and ensuring "seven fertilizers and eight irrigations" for spring crops, it is proposed to apply more phosphate and potash fertilizers to prevent lodging; 30% of the high-yield fields are to be the responsibility of the first secretaries of Party organizations at all levels, and so on.

Comparing targets, measures, and enthusiasm in areas with the same conditions makes it easier to test whether the plan in this area is advanced and reliable, and it is also easy to learn from each other's strengths and exchange experiences. Jianyang County, which produced 105 jin of ginned cotton per mu last year, proposed high-yield targets this year and challenged Renshou, Shehong, Nanbu, and other counties rich in cotton production, and handed over its own experience of "frequent fertilization, small meals and multiple meals," and "grasping the summer bolls and autumn bolls, grasping them to the end" as measures to achieve the targets. The county that responds accepts the other side's good experience because the other side's conditions and crops are the same as its own, and also supplements its own experience in production in the previous year.

From the current situation, the one or several crops that each region has set as competition projects are the local main products, some competing on rice, wheat, and other food crops, and some competing on cotton, oil crops, and other cash crops. The development of this competition will create good conditions for the high yield of various crops and the overall bumper harvest throughout the province.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang—The 1.4 million people of Fuzhou Prefecture, the first thousand-jin prefecture in Jiangxi Province, launched a production movement centered on accumulating fertilizer and making fertilizer on a grand scale after proposing a competition challenge to the five prefectures in the province for a grain yield of two thousand jin per mu and a cotton yield of one hundred jin per mu.

According to reporters' recent visits to six counties in this prefecture, including Linchuan, Chongren, Lichuan, and Zixi, everywhere are teams accumulating fertilizer, repairing water conservancy facilities, and carrying out field management. On highways, rivers, and paths, vehicles, horses, and boats transporting fertilizer and various materials are continuous. The bustling great production movement has made these places seem like the season of spring warmth and blooming flowers has arrived early.

In order to achieve this year's leap forward targets, the Fuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on summarizing the experiences of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, decided to further carry out regular inspection, visit and evaluation, and red flag competition movements extensively among counties, communes, and commune members. In the movement, they require simultaneous competition, evaluation, meetings, debates, and promotion, so that the vast number of cadres and masses from beginning to end with vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm, ensure that the mass movement from climax to higher climax. The Fuzhou Prefectural Committee also adopted the following two measures in production leadership work based on last year's practical experience: First, organize cadres to participate in production. The prefectural committee decided that from this year from the prefectural committee secretary to the commune party committee secretary and other cadres, in turn, will be sent down to the commune and production team as members for one to three months, in order to participate in production to lead production. At the same time, cadres throughout the prefecture universally grow experimental fields, learn production and lead production. Second, extensively mobilize commune members to actively participate in the democratic management of the commune, so as to promote the production enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members through the leadership method of democratic management. In order to ensure the realization of this year's leap forward target, the Fuzhou Prefectural Committee also decided to continue to conscientiously implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture.

After the Fuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward this year's leap forward targets and measures to achieve these targets, it received the warm support of the people throughout the region. Now 500,000 people throughout the prefecture have invested in the fertilizer accumulation battle, and many people's communes are preparing for spring planting a month earlier this year than in previous years.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou—The Longxi Prefecture of Fujian Province put forward the action slogan of "Going all out and fighting hard again to double grain production" and launched a production competition movement to strive for a bumper summer harvest.

Zhangpu County, which had the largest increase in production last year, proposed targets for increasing grain production per mu and total output in the challenge competition with neighboring counties; it also required a focus on grain while vigorously developing cash crops. The competitions between counties and between people's communes generally implemented the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual learning based on different conditions such as plains and mountains, striving for common leap forward and common increase in production.

The Longxi Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a mobilization rally broadcast to a million people throughout the prefecture on the 2nd, promoting the competition movement to develop more widely and deeply. Hong Yezi, the first secretary of the prefectural committee, announced this year's leap forward plan for the entire prefecture at the broadcast rally, and put forward four measures to ensure the realization of the leap forward plan: First, implement the spirit of rushing ahead instead of falling behind, and strive to harvest more in summer. Second, conscientiously implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. Third, do a good job in large-area high yield. Fourth, while currently stepping up the accumulation of fertilizer and spring planting work, it is also necessary to strengthen the field management of spring harvest crops and orchard management, seedling cultivation, etc., to ensure a bumper harvest of spring harvest crops.

    友谊竞赛　并肩前进
    四川——同条件同作物高产竞赛遍全省
    江西——抚州专区边竞赛边评比边促进
    福建——龙溪专区争取大丰收互比干劲
    据新华社成都电　四川省县与县、公社与公社之间正在展开同条件同作物的高产竞赛。
    同条件同作物的高产竞赛，是四川省各级党委在去年运用评比竞赛的方法推动生产高潮时就采用的一种很好的形式。去年，四川省除了各县的乡、社之间广泛运用这一形式进行竞赛以外，还发动平原、丘陵、山区的县与县之间分别展开竞赛。根据十七个参加竞赛县的情况，去年各县作为竞赛项目的作物多半都在原有基础上增产一倍以上，树立了水稻、棉花等各项作物大面积高产的红旗，对促进全省全面丰收起了相当大的作用。
    今年，为了争取更大更好更全面的跃进，四川各级党委进一步运用这一成功的经验，广泛组织大面积高产运动。1月初，川西平原上去年粮食平均亩产三千一百六十多斤的郫县，首先提出今年全县稻麦两熟平均亩产比去年更高的指标，向自然条件大体相同的新繁县挑战。接着，大山区的马边县向同条件的奉节县提出粮食增产挑战。随后，去年亩产油菜二百三十一斤的忠县向全省出产油菜的县发出油菜高产的战表。于是，川东、川西、川南、川北的二十多个县便纷纷拍电报、投书，相互挑战应战；还有很大一部分县正在讨论研究，准备挑战或应战。一个力争更大跃进的竞赛热潮，正在全省形成。
    同条件地区开展竞赛，双方旗鼓相当，更容易树立力争上游的思想。不但发起挑战的地区在酝酿、讨论、订计划、找措施的过程中，鼓足了干劲；接到战书的县在发动群众讨论“敢不敢赛？”“能不能胜？”等问题时，也同样意气风发，斗志昂扬。新繁县接到郫县的挑战书之后，不但在增产指标上不甘低于郫县，还发动群众想出了郫县没有提到的措施。如：在全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”，保证小春作物“七肥八水”的同时，提出多施磷钾肥防止倒伏；30％的高产田由各级党组织第一书记负责等等。
    同条件的地区比指标、比措施、比干劲，更便于检验本区的计划是否先进可靠，也容易取长补短和交流经验。去年亩产皮棉一百零五斤的简阳县，今年提出高产指标，向盛产棉花的仁寿、射洪、南部等县挑战时，就把自己“勤施肥、少量多餐”，“抓伏桃、秋桃，一抓到底”等经验作为实现指标的措施交给了对方。应战的县由于对方的条件和作物与自己相同，一方面接受对方好的经验，另方面也补充了自己在上年生产中的心得。
    从目前的情况看来，各个地区定作竞赛项目的一种或几种作物，都是本地的主产品，有的赛水稻、小麦等粮食作物，有的赛棉花、油料等经济作物。这一竞赛的开展，将为各类作物的高产和全省范围的全面丰收创造良好的条件。
    据新华社南昌电　江西省第一个千斤专区——抚州专区的一百四十万人民，向全省五个专区提出了粮食亩产双千斤、棉花亩产一百斤的竞赛战书之后，掀起了一个以积肥造肥为中心的规模壮阔的生产运动。
  据记者最近在这个专区的临川、崇仁、黎川、资溪等六县见到，不论是田野里、还是山坡上，到处都是一队队的积肥、修水利、进行田间管理的队伍，在公路、河流、便道上，运送肥料及各种物资的车马船只连绵不断。热火朝天的大生产运动使这些地方好像春暖花开的季节提早来到了一样。
    为了实现今年的跃进指标，中共抚州地委在总结1958年大跃进经
      验的基础上，决定进一步在
      县与县、公社与公社、社员
      与社员之间，广泛开展定期
      检查、参观评比和红旗竞赛
      运动。在运动中，他们要求
      作到边竞赛、边评比，边开
      会、边辩论、边促进，使广
      大干部和群众自始至终地以旺盛的革命干劲，保证群众运动从高潮走向更高潮。抚州地委还根据去年实践的经验在生产领导工作方面采取以下两项措施：一、组织干部参加生产，地委决定今年从地委书记到公社党委书记等干部，轮流下放到公社、生产队当一个月到三个月的社员，以参加生产来领导生产。同时，全专区干部普遍种试验田，学习生产和领导生产。二、广泛发动社员积极参加公社民主管理，以便通过民主管理的领导方法，来发扬广大社员的生产积极性。为了保证实现今年跃进指标，抚州地委还决定继续认真贯彻农业“八字宪法”。
    中共抚州地委提出了今年的跃进指标和实现这个指标的措施后，获得了全区人民的热烈拥护。现在全专区有五十万人投入了积肥战斗，许多人民公社今年比往年提早了一个月进行春播准备。
    据新华社福州电　福建省龙溪专区提出“鼓足干劲再苦战，粮食产量翻一番”的行动口号，展开了争取夏季大丰收的生产竞赛运动。
    去年增产幅度最大的漳浦县，在向邻近几个县挑战竞赛中提出了粮食亩产和总产量增产指标；要求在抓粮食的同时大搞经济作物。各县之间和各人民公社之间进行的竞赛，大都根据平原、山区等不同条件，贯彻了互相帮助，互相学习的精神，争取共同跃进，共同增产。
    中共龙溪地委在2日召开了全专区百万人誓师广播大会，促进这一竞赛运动更加广泛和深入地开展。地委第一书记洪椰子在广播大会上宣布了今年全专区的跃进规划，提出了四项保证跃进规划实现的措施：第一，贯彻赶前不赶后精神，争取夏季多收。第二，认真贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”。第三，搞好大面积丰产。第四，在当前加紧积肥和春播工作的同时，还要加强春收作物的田间管理和果园管理、育苗等，保证春收作物丰收。
