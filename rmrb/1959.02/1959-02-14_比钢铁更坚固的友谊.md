Friendship Stronger Than Steel
Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Qian Junrui

    In the past month or so, we have celebrated with great joy the great victory of the all-round Great Leap Forward of our people in 1958, the tremendous success of socialist and communist construction in the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the epoch-making brilliant achievement of the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial solar planet, and the victorious conclusion of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In particular, the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which declared the Soviet Union's entry into a new era of comprehensively unfolding communist construction, made outstanding contributions to the development of the international communist movement and the strengthening of world peace forces. Today, as we have just celebrated the Spring Festival, when the sun shines and the spring blossoms, we are also happily celebrating the ninth anniversary of the signing of the great Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. Good news comes one after another, how happy and excited we are! We believe that such a joyful mood is shared by all peace-loving people around the world.

    Nine years ago, on the third day after the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, Chairman Mao said this: "The full understanding and deep friendship established between us on the basis of the fundamental interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union are difficult to describe in words. People can see that the unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union, which has already been fixed by the treaty, will be permanent, indestructible, and no one can separate it. And this unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of China and the Soviet Union, but also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of world peace and justice." The further away the days are, the more the truth shines. The practice of the people of China and the Soviet Union and all mankind in the past nine years has powerfully confirmed the correctness of Chairman Mao's thesis.

    In the nine years since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, the fraternal unity and friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union have been continuously developing and consolidating. This unity and friendly relationship between our two countries is based on the principles of proletarian internationalism and complete equality. It not only conforms to the fundamental interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union, but also completely coincides with the fundamental interests of the people of the world. It has an incomparably strong vitality, and therefore can continue to develop forward with the force of a landslide and tsunami.

    The nine years since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance have also been nine years of close economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Based on the spirit of this Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, China and the Soviet Union have signed a series of agreements and protocols on economic cooperation and technical cooperation on the basis of complete equality and fraternal mutual assistance, thereby vigorously promoting the economic construction of the two countries and promoting the strength and prosperity of our two countries. Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement in 1950, the trade volume between China and the Soviet Union has continued to increase, increasing nearly three times in 1957 compared to 1950, and increasing by about 18% in 1958 compared to 1957. At present, China's trade volume with the Soviet Union accounts for about 50% of China's total foreign trade; the Soviet Union's trade volume with China also ranks first in the Soviet Union's total foreign trade. The Soviet Union has given extremely important assistance to China's socialist industrialization. According to the agreements signed between China and the Soviet Union during China's first five-year plan, the Soviet Union helped China build a total of 211 projects. In August 1958, China and the Soviet Union signed an agreement on the Soviet Union's technical assistance to China in the construction and expansion of 47 important industrial enterprises, as the first batch of Soviet assistance to China in implementing the second five-year plan. And on February 7 this year, Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Khrushchev signed an agreement in Moscow on cooperation between the two sides in building 78 large industrial enterprises and power stations in China from 1959 to 1967. These huge assistances have played and will continue to play a very important role in China's socialist construction.

    The cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in science and culture has greatly developed. In the past nine years, the Soviet government has dispatched a total of more than 7,000 experts to China at the invitation of our country. With a high degree of internationalism and rich scientific and technological knowledge and experience, they have helped China solve many scientific and technological problems and helped us train a large number of scientific and technological cadres. Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement in October 1954 and the signing of the Cultural Cooperation Agreement in 1956, the scientific and cultural cooperation and exchanges between the two countries have been carried out in a more planned and systematic manner. In 1956, the Soviet Union sent a large number of outstanding scientists to assist China in formulating a twelve-year science development plan. In December 1957, China and the Soviet Union signed a Scientific Cooperation Agreement, and in January 1958, they signed a protocol on jointly conducting and the Soviet Union assisting China in conducting 122 major scientific and technological research projects from 1958 to 1962. These have greatly strengthened the scientific and technological cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, especially promoting China's scientific and technological research work. The number of Chinese students sent to the Soviet Union from 1951 to 1958 reached 6,561. So far, 1,064 have completed their studies and returned to China. The Soviet Union began sending students to China to study in 1957. So far, there are a total of 113 people. The exchanges and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in publishing have also been developing. From October 1949 to November 1958, China translated and published more than 2,000 Soviet books, with more than 295 million copies. The Soviet Union has translated and published a large number of Chinese books in 32 languages, including more than 460 literary works, with more than 24 million copies. The mutual visits of cultural and artistic groups between China and the Soviet Union have been increasing. From 1949 to 1958, China sent a total of 134 cultural and artistic groups with 2,334 people to visit the Soviet Union. During the same period, the Soviet Union sent a total of 112 cultural and artistic groups with 2,301 people to visit China. In terms of film exchange, from 1949 to 1958, China released a total of 747 Soviet films, with approximately 1.9 billion viewers. During the same period, the Soviet Union released a total of 102 Chinese films, with approximately 300 million viewers. The mutual visits and friendly competitions of Sino-Soviet sports delegations have also become increasingly frequent. In 1958, China sent 19 sports delegations with 277 people to visit the Soviet Union; the Soviet Union sent nine delegations to visit China. All these have played a significant role in the prosperity of science and culture and the enhancement of friendship between the two countries.

    The great Sino-Soviet alliance has had a tremendous impact on the world situation from the day it was established. First of all, it has effectively guaranteed the security of China and the Soviet Union, promoted the prosperity and development of the construction undertakings of our two countries, thereby greatly strengthening the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and providing a reliable guarantee for world peace and the cause of human progress. Secondly, the consistent unity of China and the Soviet Union for the past nine years, working together to oppose wars of aggression, safeguard world peace, and develop the cause of human progress, has made great contributions. The countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union all have fraternal friendship and the obligation of internationalist mutual assistance. If the imperialist aggressive blocs dare to carry out any aggression and provocative activities against socialist countries, they will inevitably be met with the most resolute and powerful counterattacks.

    China and the Soviet Union sympathize with and support the national liberation movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In 1956, British and French imperialism launched a war of aggression against Egypt. In 1957, US imperialism plotted to invade Syria. In 1958, US imperialism directly supported the armed rebellion in Indonesia. In the same year, the United States, colluding with Britain, armed invasion of Lebanon and Jordan, conspired against the newly born Republic of Iraq. In early 1959, US imperialism again interfered with Cuba's national liberation movement. In these events where imperialists aggressed against small countries and threatened world peace, China and the Soviet Union have consistently and resolutely opposed imperialist aggressors and supported the people who are striving for and safeguarding national independence. In August 1958, when US and British imperialism were carrying out armed aggression in the Middle East, Comrades Mao Zedong and Khrushchev held talks. The communique of this meeting pointed out: "The national liberation movement is an irresistible trend, the colonial era is gone forever, and any attempt to maintain and restore colonial rule that runs counter to the trend of history is harmful to the cause of peace and is doomed to failure." The communique also said: "If imperialist war maniacs dare to impose war on the people of the world, then all peace-loving and freedom-loving countries and people will inevitably unite closely, thoroughly eliminate the imperialist aggressors, and lay the foundation for permanent world peace." This gave the imperialist aggressive bloc an extremely serious blow, gave strong support to the national liberation movements of Asian, African, and Latin American countries, and gave great encouragement to all peace-loving countries and people in the world.

    China and the Soviet Union have always advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, the implementation of the Five Principles and the spirit of the Bandung Conference; insisted on maintaining peace measures such as disarmament, banning weapons of mass destruction, replacing military blocs with collective security systems, and abolishing foreign military bases; and are making unremitting efforts to ease international tensions. Recently, the Soviet government put forward suggestions on ending the foreign occupation of Berlin and making West Berlin a free city, and put forward suggestions on convening a meeting to discuss and sign a peace treaty with Germany. Our government has also issued a statement fully supporting the Soviet Union's major initiative, which is very beneficial to consolidating peace in Europe and the world. China and the Soviet Union have also unanimously exposed and condemned the conspiracy of the US-Japanese reactionaries to revise the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and further endanger peace in the Far East. The Chinese people express their warm support for the initiative put forward by Comrade Khrushchev at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to establish a Far East peace zone, especially a nuclear-weapon-free zone. These efforts made by China and the Soviet Union hand in hand to safeguard world peace and collective security have been praised by all peace-loving countries and people around the world.

    The Chinese people have received fraternal support from the Soviet people in the struggle against imperialism. The Soviet government and people have consistently condemned all slanders and provocations by the imperialist aggressive bloc against our country. Last September, when US imperialism was carrying out military provocations and war threats against our country in the Taiwan Strait area, Comrade Khrushchev issued such a severe warning to US President Eisenhower: "An encroachment on our great friend, ally, and neighbor, the People's Republic of China, is an encroachment on the Soviet Union. Loyal to its obligations, our country will do everything possible, together with the People's China, to safeguard the security of the two countries, to safeguard the interests of peace in the Far East and the interests of world peace." Comrade Khrushchev's warning to US imperialism and the Soviet people's full support for the just struggle of the Chinese people gave the Chinese people great encouragement.

    All these facts prove that the unity and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is a reliable guarantee for promoting world peace and the cause of human progress, and is related to the future destiny of the entire mankind. It is precisely because of this that the imperialist aggressive bloc, first of all the US imperialists and its despicable tool, the modern revisionists, have used all despicable tricks, fabricated rumors and slanders, and tried to undermine the great unity between China and the Soviet Union. Like idiots, they tried hard to find topics from our country's great leap forward in production and construction and our country's people's communes, in order to achieve their shameful purpose of provoking and undermining Sino-Soviet unity and friendship. But what kind of ending did they end up with? What did they get? Well, listen:

    The communique of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of our Party pointed out: "In the past year, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become stronger and more united. All provocations, curses, and sabotage by imperialist reactionaries and revisionists are doomed to failure."

    Comrade Zhou Enlai solemnly declared at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on behalf of the entire Chinese people and all members of the Communist Party of China: "The Soviet Union and China are socialist fraternal countries. Marxism-Leninism closely unites our two countries and all socialist countries. The people of our two countries are the closest comrades-in-arms who have been tested for a long time. Our destinies are common, our interests are consistent, and the close friendship between the people of our two countries will always be unbreakable. The imperialists headed by the United States and the Yugoslav modern revisionists spare no effort to adopt all despicable means to provoke and undermine the unity between China and the Soviet Union. But they will get nothing but disappointment. Let the imperialists and modern revisionists daydream! Our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, and all countries in our socialist camp, will certainly always unite together and move forward with heroic strides on the road to communism."

    Comrade Khrushchev also emphasized in his report to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: We are in complete agreement with the fraternal Communist Party of China in all respects… Why do we have no differences with the Communist Party of China? This is because the class viewpoints and class understanding of the two parties are consistent. The Communist Party of China firmly stands on the class position and the Marxist-Leninist position. It is carrying out the struggle against imperialists and exploiters, it is transforming life according to socialist principles, it follows the principles of international proletarian solidarity, and it is guided by Marxist-Leninist theory. "It can be told to the Yugoslav revisionists: Don't look for cracks where there are no cracks… This will not lead to anything. You can't see this, just like you can't see your own ears."

    Those poor creatures, the imperialists and modern revisionists, can expect nothing but shameful failure from their provocations, slanders, and attempts to sow discord regarding the great Sino-Soviet friendship. Let the enemy break their heads on the wall of the Sino-Soviet alliance, which is stronger than steel! We cannot prohibit them from doing what they insist on doing. We will do everything in our power to consolidate and develop the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and to consolidate and develop the great friendship between all countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    比钢铁更坚固的友谊
    中苏友好协会总会秘书长　钱俊瑞
    在最近一个多月的时间里，我们怀着十分欢乐的心情，庆祝了1958年我国人民全面大跃进的伟大胜利，庆祝了以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营社会主义共产主义建设的巨大成功，庆祝了苏联发射第一个人造太阳行星的划时代的光辉成就，庆祝了苏共二十一次代表大会的胜利闭幕。特别是苏共二十一次代表大会，宣告苏联进入全面展开共产主义建设的新时期，它对发展国际共产主义运动和增强世界和平力量作出了卓越的贡献。今天，当我们刚刚欢度春节，正当阳光普照，春暖花开的时分，我们又欣逢伟大的中苏友好同盟互助条约签订九周年。喜事一个接一个，我们的心里是多么高兴和兴奋啊！我们相信，这样欢乐的心境是全世界一切爱好和平的人们所共有的。
    九年前，在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订后的第三天，毛主席说过这么一段话：“我们相互间在中苏两大国人民根本利益的基础上所建立起来的充分了解与深厚友谊，是难以用言语来形容的。人们可以看得见：业已经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的团结将是永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。而这种团结，不但必然要影响到中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”日子离得越远，真理就越发闪耀出它的光芒。九年来中苏两国人民和全人类的实践，都有力地证实了毛主席这个论断的正确性。
    九年以来，中苏两国之间的兄弟般的团结友好关系，一直在不断地发展和巩固着。我们两国的这种团结友好关系，是以无产阶级的国际主义和完全平等的原则为基础的，不但符合中苏两国人民的根本利益，而且和全世界人民的根本利益也是完全一致的。它具有强大无比的生命力，因而能够以排山倒海之势不断地向前发展着。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约签订以后的九年，也就是中苏两国在经济上紧密合作的九年。中苏两国根据这个友好同盟互助条约的精神，在完全平等和兄弟般的互助的基础上，签订了一系列的有关经济合作和技术合作的协定和协议书，从而有力地促进了两国的经济建设，促成了我们两国的国力的壮大和繁荣。从1950年签订中苏贸易协定以来，中苏贸易额不断增长，1957年比1950年增长了近三倍，1958年又比1957年增长18％左右。目前，我国对苏联的贸易额占我国对外贸易总额的50％左右；苏联对我国的贸易额在苏联对外贸易总额中也占第一位。苏联对我国的社会主义工业化给了极其重大的帮助。根据我国第一个五年计划期间中苏两国签订的协定，苏联帮助我国建设的工程共有二百一十一项。1958年8月中苏又签订了关于苏联在技术上援助我国建设和扩建四十七项重要工业企业的协定，作为苏联对我国实行第二个五年计划的第一批援助。而在今年2月7日，又由周恩来总理和赫鲁晓夫主席在莫斯科签订了一项关于双方进行合作在1959—1967年间在我国建设七十八个大型工业企业和电站的协定。这些巨大的援助对我国的社会主义建设起了并将继续起极重大的作用。
    中苏两国在科学和文化方面的合作有了极大的发展。九年来，苏联政府应我国的聘请派来我国的专家共七千多位。他们以高度的国际主义精神和丰富的科学技术知识与经验，帮助我国解决许多科学技术问题，帮助我们培养了大批科学技术干部。从1954年10月中苏两国签订科学技术合作协定、1956年签订文化合作协定以后，两国科学文化的合作和交流更加有计划有系统地开展起来。1956年苏联派遣大批优秀科学家协助我国制定了十二年科学发展规划。1957年12月中苏又签订了科学合作协定，1958年1月签订了1958—1962年关于共同进行和苏联帮助中国进行一百二十二项重大科学技术研究的议定书。这些都极大地加强了中苏两国的科学技术合作，特别是促进了我国的科学技术研究工作。我国派往苏联的留学生，从1951—1958年，共达六千五百六十一人，到目前为止，学成归国的已有一千零六十四人。苏联从1957年开始派遣留学生到我国来学习，到现在为止，共有一百一十三人。中苏两国在出版工作方面的交流和合作也日益发展。从1949年10月到1958年11月，我国翻译出版苏联的书籍有二千多种，二亿九千五百多万册。苏联曾用三十二种文字翻译出版了大批中国书籍，其中文学作品有四百六十多部，二千四百多万册。中苏两国文化艺术团体的相互访问不断增加。从1949—1958年，我国赴苏访问的文化艺术团体共有一百三十四起二，千三百三十四人。在同时期内，苏联访问我国的文化艺术团体共有一百一十二起，二千三百零一人。在电影交流方面，从1949—1958年，我国共发行苏联电影七百四十七部，观众约十九亿多人次。在同时期内，苏联共发行我国影片一百零二部，观众约三亿多人次。中苏体育代表团的相互访问和友谊比赛也日益频繁。在1958年我国往苏联访问的体育代表团有十九起，二百七十七人；苏联来我国访问的有九起。所有这些，对两国科学文化的繁荣和友谊的增强都起了重大的作用。
    伟大的中苏同盟从它成立那一天起，就对世界形势产生了巨大的影响。首先，它有力地保障了中苏两国的安全，促进了我们两国建设事业的繁荣和发展，从而极大地壮大了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量，为世界和平和人类进步事业提供了可靠的保证。其次，中苏两国九年来始终如一地团结一致，为反对侵略战争、维护世界和平，发展人类进步事业而共同奋斗，并且作出了伟大的贡献。中苏两大国在反对美帝国主义在朝鲜发动的侵略战争中，在支持越南民主共和国反对美、法帝国主义在印度支那进行的殖民战争中，在支持匈牙利人民扑灭由帝国主义侵略集团所煽动的反革命叛乱中，都充分地表现出亲密合作的强大力量。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国，都具有兄弟般的友谊和国际主义的互相帮助的义务，帝国主义侵略集团如果胆敢对社会主义国家进行任何侵略和挑衅活动，必将受到最坚决最有力的回击。
    中苏两国同情和支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民的民族解放运动。1956年，英法帝国主义发动了侵略埃及的战争。1957年，美帝国主义阴谋侵略叙利亚。1958年，美帝国主义直接支持印度尼西亚的武装叛乱。同年，美国伙同英国武装侵犯黎巴嫩和约旦，阴谋反对新生的伊拉克共和国。1959年初，美帝国主义又对古巴的民族解放运动横加干涉。在帝国主义者这些侵略弱小国家和威胁世界和平的事件中，中苏两国都曾一致地坚决反对帝国主义侵略者，支持那些争取和维护民族独立的人民。1958年8月，正当美英帝国主义武装侵略中东的时候，毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志举行了会谈。这次会谈的公报中就曾指出：“民族解放运动是不可抗拒的潮流，殖民主义时代已经一去不复返了，任何维持和恢复违背历史潮流的殖民统治的企图都是危害和平事业，都是注定要失败的。”会谈公报还说：“如果帝国主义战争狂人竟敢把战争强加在世界人民头上，那末所有爱好和平和爱好自由的国家和人民必将紧紧地团结在一起，彻底地消灭帝国主义侵略者，奠定世界的永久和平。”这给了帝国主义侵略集团以极其严重的打击，给了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国民族解放运动以有力的支持，给了世界上所有爱好和平的国家和人民以巨大的鼓舞。
    中苏两国一向主张，不同社会制度的国家和平共处，实现五项原则和万隆会议的精神；坚持裁减军备、禁止大规模毁灭性武器、以集体安全体系代替军事集团和取消外国军事基地等维护和平的措施；并为和缓国际紧张局势而进行着不懈的努力。最近苏联政府提出了关于结束外国对柏林的占领，使西柏林成为自由城市的建议，提出了召开和会，讨论和签订对德和约的建议。我国政府也曾发表声明，完全支持苏联这个对巩固欧洲与世界和平十分有利的重大倡议。中苏两国还一致揭露和谴责美日反动派修改美日“安全条约”、进一步危害远东和平的阴谋。赫鲁晓夫同志在苏共第二十一次代表大会上提出的建立远东和平地区、首先是无原子武器区的倡议，我国人民表示热烈支持。中苏两国携手协作为保卫世界和平和集体安全所作的这些努力，得到了全世界所有爱好和平的国家和人民的赞扬。
    我国人民在反对帝国主义的斗争中，得到了苏联人民兄弟般的支持。苏联政府和人民一贯地谴责帝国主义侵略集团对我国的一切污蔑和挑衅。去年9月，当美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区对我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁的时候，赫鲁晓夫同志向美国总统艾森豪威尔发出了这样严厉的警告：“对我国伟大的朋友、盟邦和邻国中华人民共和国的侵犯也就是对苏联的侵犯。忠于自己义务的我国，将尽一切可能同人民中国一道来维护两国的安全，维护远东和平的利益和世界和平的利益。”赫鲁晓夫同志对美帝国主义的警告和苏联人民对中国人民的正义斗争的全力支持，给了我国人民以莫大的鼓舞。
    这一切事实都证明，中苏两国的团结合作是促进世界和平和人类进步事业的可靠保证，并且关系着整个人类未来的命运。正是因为这样，帝国主义侵略集团，首先是美帝国主义者和它的卑贱的工具现代修正主义者，便使出一切卑鄙的伎俩，造谣中伤，力图破坏中苏两国之间的伟大团结。他们像白痴一样，使劲地想从我国的生产建设大跃进和我国的人民公社身上找题目，以达到他们挑拨和破坏中苏团结友好的可耻目的。但是他们究竟落得一个什么下场呢？他们究竟得到些什么东西呢？那么，请听吧：
    我们党的八届六中全会的公报中指出：“在过去一年中，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营更加壮大了，团结得更加巩固了。帝国主义反动派和修正主义者的一切挑拨、咒骂和破坏，都注定要失败。”
    周恩来同志在苏共二十一次代表大会上代表全体中国人民和全体中国共产党党员庄严地声明：“苏联和中国是社会主义的兄弟之邦。马克思列宁主义把我们两国和所有社会主义国家紧密地团结在一起。我们两国人民是经过长期考验的最亲密的战友。我们的命运是共同的，我们的利害是一致的，我们两国人民的亲密友谊永远是牢不可破的。以美国为首的帝国主义者和南斯拉夫现代修正主义者不惜采取一切卑鄙手段，挑拨和破坏中苏两国之间的团结。但是他们除了失望之外，是什么也得不到的。让帝国主义者和现代修正主义者白昼做梦吧！我们中苏两国，我们所有社会主义阵营的国家，一定永远团结在一起，迈开英雄的步伐，在通往共产主义的大道上前进。”
    赫鲁晓夫同志在向苏共二十一次代表大会的报告中也着重地指出：我们在一切方面都同兄弟的中国共产党完全一致……为什么我们和中国共产党没有分歧呢？这是因为两个党的阶级观点和阶级理解是一致的。中国共产党坚定地站在阶级立场，马克思列宁主义立场上。它进行着反对帝国主义者和剥削者的斗争，它在根据社会主义原则改造生活，它遵循国际无产阶级团结的原则，并以马克思列宁主义理论为指南。“可以告诉南斯拉夫修正主义者们：不要在没有裂缝的地方去找裂缝。……这是不会有什么结果的。你们看不到这一点，正像看不到自己的耳朵一样。”
    帝国主义者和现代修正主义者那些可怜虫们对于中苏伟大友谊的挑拨离间、造谣中伤，除了可耻的失败外，再也不能指望别的什么收获。让敌人在中苏同盟的比钢铁更坚固的墙壁上碰个头破血流吧！我们不能禁止他们做他们所硬要做的事。我们将竭尽全力来巩固和发展中苏两国之间的伟大友谊，巩固和发展以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国间的伟大友谊。
