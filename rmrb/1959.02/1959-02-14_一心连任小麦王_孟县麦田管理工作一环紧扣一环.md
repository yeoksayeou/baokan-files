People of Meng County, Henan, who won the title of high wheat yield last year, are determined to achieve a greater leap forward this year with soaring enthusiasm. The county plans to double its wheat production this year based on last year's average yield of 500 jin per mu, guaranteeing the realization of a "1,000-jin county" and striving for a yield of 1,200 jin per mu.

Currently, the 300,000 mu of wheat in the county is growing very well. According to recent inspections, each plant generally has about three tillers, and the main roots are deeply rooted. The 70,000 mu of high-yield fields and 110,000 mu of large-area high-yield plots, composed of thousands of mu of contiguous high-yield fields from various communes and teams throughout the county, are growing even better, with each mu having reached about 1 million tillers; the 80,000 mu of general wheat fields have about 800,000 tillers per mu; even the worst 40,000 mu of wheat fields have an average of 400,000 to 600,000 tillers per mu.

Last year, the county's wheat sowing time was not only 20 days earlier than in previous years, but the 300,000 mu of wheat fields were generally deep-plowed to a depth of more than one chi, with an average application of 3,500 jin of base fertilizer per mu and a sowing rate of 32 jin per mu. Now, the county has launched a vigorous winter wheat field management red flag competition, with more than 92,000 people participating in the competition, including 54,000 people directly engaged in wheat field management. Communes have also generally adopted methods such as inserting red flags, hanging red lanterns, holding contests, launching satellites, organizing reports of good news, and holding field celebrations to encourage morale. As a result, the enthusiasm of the people of the county to do a good job in wheat field management has soared.

In order to strengthen leadership over wheat field management, the county established a wheat field management headquarters. More than 150 cadres were transferred from the county to go deep into the communes for four months. Communes also delegated cadres at all levels to strengthen grassroots leadership. Communes throughout the county also made overall arrangements for labor and organized more than 300 professional teams, implementing a wheat field management responsibility system from top to bottom.

Communes throughout the county also divided the wheat fields into sections and squares based on geographical conditions and wheat growth, assigning professional teams to each square, achieving "every road has a commander, every square has a general, every plot has a soldier, and everyone has a responsibility."

In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and make the wheat field management work reach one climax after another, interlocking with each other, the Meng County Committee of the Communist Party of China has also constantly put forward new combat tasks based on the wheat growth and characteristics. For example, after completing seedling inspection and replanting, a high tide of topdressing and watering was launched. During wheat field management, three inspections of stations and teams were conducted to continuously expand first-class seedlings, improve second-class seedlings, and eliminate third-class seedlings. In order to prepare enough "food" for wheat, the county has recently launched a high tide of accumulating and making fertilizer, with daily fertilizer accumulation increasing from 100 million jin to 800 million jin.

The Meng County Committee of the Communist Party of China recently proposed that great efforts should be made in technical measures for wheat field management, resolutely achieving five fertilizer applications and seven waterings for general fields, seven fertilizer applications and seven waterings for high-yield fields, and sufficient fertilizer and sufficient water for high-yield fields; in management, three hoeings, five harrowings, two weedings, and two rollings should be carried out to resolutely guarantee the realization of a "1,000-jin wheat county."

    一心连任小麦王
    孟县麦田管理工作一环紧扣一环
    本报郑州13日电　去年获得小麦高产称号的河南孟县人民，以冲天的干劲，决心争取今年实现更大的跃进。全县计划今年小麦产量，要在去年平均亩产五百斤的基础上翻一番，保证实现千斤县，争取亩产一千二百斤。
    目前，全县三十万亩小麦生长十分良好。根据最近检查，一般每棵分蘖三个左右，主根扎得很深。由全县各社、队数千亩连片的大面积高额丰产田组成的七万亩高产田和十一万亩大面积丰产方，麦苗长得更好，每亩分蘖已达一百万株左右；八万亩一般麦田，每亩分蘖八十万株左右；最差的四万亩小麦田，每亩平均分蘖也在四十万到六十万株。
    去年全县小麦播种时间，不仅比往年提前了二十天，三十万亩小麦田一般还深翻一尺以上，每亩施底肥三千五百斤，播种量平均每亩三十二斤。现在全县又展开了热火朝天的冬季麦田管理红旗竞赛，全县参加竞赛的人数达九万二千多人，其中直接搞麦田管理的有五万四千人。各社还普遍采取了插红旗，挂红灯，打擂台，放卫星，组织报喜，田间贺功等办法，鼓励士气。这样，全县人民搞好麦田管理的干劲顿时冲天而起。
    为了加强对麦田管理的领导，县里成立了麦田管理指挥部。全县抽调一百五十多个干部深入公社，大搞四个月。公社也层层下放干部，加强基层领导。全县各社对劳力也做了统筹安排，组织了三百多个专业队，自上而下实行了麦田管理责任制。
    全县各社还根据地理条件和麦子生长情况，在麦田中划路分方，按方固定专业队，做到了“路路有帅，方方有将，块块有兵，人人有责”。
    为了调动群众的积极性，使得麦田管理工作一个高潮接着一个高潮，一环扣一环，中共孟县县委还不断根据小麦生长情况和特点，提出新的战斗任务。如在完成查苗补苗后，又掀起追肥浇水高潮。在麦田管理中，又进行了三次检查站队，不断扩大一类苗，提高二类苗，消灭三类苗。为了给小麦准备足够的“粮食”，最近全县又掀起了积肥造肥高潮，每天积肥由一亿斤增加到八亿斤。
    中共孟县县委最近又提出在麦田管理上要大抓技术措施，坚决做到一般田五肥七水，丰产田七肥七水，高产田足肥足水；在管理上，要做到三锄五耙两拔草、两镇压，坚决保证实现小麦千斤县。
