Looking at the Currency War in Western Europe from the Free Convertibility of the Pound Sterling
Yao Nianqing
The increasingly intense conflicts among Western capitalist countries are also becoming more apparent in the financial sphere. At the end of 1958, Britain, France, and West Germany simultaneously announced limited currency convertibility. The French franc was devalued at the same time, and the mark soon followed with further implementation of full convertibility. Most other Western European countries followed suit with roughly the same measures. This is a very complex struggle. Although related to the long-standing battle between the pound sterling and the U.S. dollar, the main reason for this battle is the struggle between the pound sterling and the West German mark, which has developed rapidly in recent years and has been intensified by the establishment of the Western European "Common Market."

The Old Road of the Pound Sterling-U.S. Dollar Struggle

Mentioning the free convertibility of the pound sterling brings to mind the relatively broad free convertibility that Britain was forced to implement in 1947 under the pressure of a $3.75 billion U.S. loan. The result was that within six weeks, Britain's reserves flowed out by $1 billion, and it had to restore foreign exchange controls. Since then, the United States has never given up the idea of forcing the free convertibility of the pound sterling, and has carried out many activities for this purpose. For U.S. monopoly capital, if the pound sterling could be freely converted into U.S. dollars without restriction, it would remove the foreign exchange and trade controls of the sterling area against the United States, and clear an important obstacle for their expansion into Britain's sphere of influence. However, British monopoly capital, with completely different purposes, also demanded the implementation of free convertibility of the pound sterling when conditions were favorable—sufficient reserves and stable balance of payments for the sterling area. In their view, a pound sterling that cannot be freely converted into foreign currencies like the U.S. dollar can never achieve the same status as the U.S. dollar.

The struggle to raise the status of the pound sterling has very real significance for British monopoly capital. The pound sterling is a currency widely used internationally. London has 3.3 billion pounds sterling in foreign deposits. If the pound sterling is always in a weaker and more dangerous position than the U.S. dollar, then people will always try to shift these funds to New York. In this way, at the slightest disturbance, a crisis of selling off the pound sterling will appear in the market, and in the long run, London deposits will gradually transfer outward, leading to the disintegration of the sterling area. Therefore, raising the status of the pound sterling is a battle that British monopoly capital is fully committed to, and achieving the free convertibility of the pound sterling when conditions are right is also their long-term goal.

The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in 1952 determined a plan for the free convertibility of the pound sterling. Since then, having learned the lessons of 1947, British monopoly capital has been carefully trying to prepare conditions for the free convertibility of the pound sterling, and has been constantly bargaining with the United States. The situation over the years has shown that their first goal is to implement limited free convertibility of the pound sterling (generally speaking, this means allowing everyone residing outside the sterling area to freely convert the pound sterling they earn into U.S. dollars at the official rate, but the pound sterling held by residents of the sterling area cannot be freely converted, and investments within the sterling area cannot be freely withdrawn). However, the three pound sterling crises that occurred in 1955, 1956, and 1957 shelved this plan.

There were some more complex changes in 1958. At the beginning of the year, British monopoly capital was very afraid of the continued development of the U.S. dollar shortage. They feared that countries would sell off their pound sterling in the free market to exchange for U.S. dollars due to the lack of U.S. dollars, thereby squeezing out the pound sterling. They formally requested the United States to come up with money to greatly increase the credit of the International Monetary Fund, in order to alleviate the reserve shortage of various countries, especially the sterling area. However, the U.S. dollar shortage did not continue to develop in 1958, but instead turned into an outflow of U.S. gold. Based on this, the reserves of the sterling area showed a larger increase (increasing by $1.2 billion from the end of September 1957 to the end of 1958). At this time, Canada openly proposed—which largely reflected the opinion of the United States—to convert the pound sterling and relax import controls on goods from the U.S. dollar area. After that, in August, Eisenhower expressed that he would consider increasing the credit of the International Monetary Fund. In September, Britain announced the relaxation of import controls on goods from the U.S. dollar area by Britain and its colonies. In early October, Britain discussed the conditions for the free convertibility of the pound sterling at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund. This series of facts shows that if the United States is willing to make some expansions to the International Monetary Fund's credit, Britain will carry out a certain degree of free convertibility. At the same time, some signs of the pound sterling preparing to implement free convertibility appeared in the currency market.

The above situation shows one aspect of the problem: this free convertibility of the pound sterling is still following the old road of the pound sterling-U.S. dollar struggle. It can also be said that the United States and Britain have temporarily made a deal: the United States has obtained some opportunities to increase exports (including other countries being able to transfer the pound sterling earned from the sterling area to purchase goods from the U.S. dollar area); Britain has obtained some credit facilities and implemented partial free convertibility of the pound sterling in the case of a weak U.S. dollar. In addition, for Britain, some foreign exchange transactions that were originally carried out in the semi-black market called "free market" abroad have been transferred to London due to the limited free convertibility of the pound sterling, which is also a subordinate benefit.

However, this free convertibility of the pound sterling is by no means just a problem for the U.S. dollar. On the one hand, the United States did not exert much pressure on Britain on this issue in 1958. On the other hand, even according to the standards of British monopoly capital itself, the current conditions for the free convertibility of the pound sterling are very reluctant.

      Reluctant Free Convertibility

First of all, insufficient reserves. We can compare the situation in 1954, when the pound sterling was close to free convertibility but failed to achieve it. At the end of 1958, Britain's gold and U.S. dollar reserves totaled $3.2 billion, while at the end of 1954, it was $2.8 billion. However, of the reserves in 1958, $560 million was a short-term loan from the International Monetary Fund, and $250 million was borrowed from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which was also a short-term credit. At least the International Monetary Fund's loan in 1954 could be obtained in accordance with the organization's regulations, so the actual reserves at the end of 1958 were less than in 1954. As for the credit of the International Monetary Fund, although it has increased, it is pitifully small. The organization's board of directors advocated increasing the quotas of each member state by 50%. According to the organization's usual lending situation, even at best, it could only enable Britain to obtain $650 million in credit facilities (equivalent to the increased British quota this time), and Britain would have to pay 25% of its own quota, i.e., $160 million in gold first. On the other hand, the free convertibility of Western European currencies ended the European Payments Union, and at the end of November last year, Britain still had more than $300 million in credit available in the European Payments Union. Calculating this account, Britain's benefits are less than $200 million.

More importantly, the external balance of payments of the sterling area does not have a stable prospect. The increase in reserves last year was largely temporary. It was mainly due to three reasons: First, the funds that flowed out during the pound sterling crisis in the past later flowed back. The role of this factor is now getting smaller and smaller. Second, due to the conditions of the capitalist world crisis, the decline in raw material prices has enabled Britain to save on import costs from the U.S. dollar area, and Britain's exports to the United States have temporarily maintained a high level due to some special factors, so the balance of payments with the U.S. dollar area has turned favorable. But this itself contains a big contradiction. Because, if the U.S. economy continues to decline, it will sooner or later affect Britain's exports to the United States; if U.S. industrial production can recover, it will also cause raw material prices to rise, thereby increasing the price of Britain's imports from the U.S. dollar area. Therefore, in this regard, the situation will not continue to be favorable to Britain. Third, other parts of the sterling area obtained a large number of loans from the World Bank, the United States, and West Germany, which made up for the decline in export income, so in 1958, they paid more gold and U.S. dollars to London. However, British monopoly capital cannot hope to rely on this type of loan for a long time without shaking their position in the sterling area.

Of course, there is also such a condition for the limited free convertibility of the pound sterling, that is: since 1954, there has been a semi-black market in New York and Zurich. The part of the pound sterling that is open for conversion this time could have been converted into U.S. dollars in this semi-black market at an exchange rate lower than the official rate; and in order to avoid excessively affecting the pound sterling's reputation and prevent speculation unfavorable to Britain, the British authorities have been active in these markets since 1955, supporting the pound sterling's exchange rate so that it would not be too much lower than the official rate. Therefore, London financial circles said that this time Britain is only legalizing the free convertibility that already exists in fact, and has not increased much additional risk as a result. Indeed, the experience of the past few pound sterling crises shows that even though Britain has not implemented the free convertibility of the pound sterling, the pound sterling will still be converted into U.S. dollars and flow away in large quantities.

However, this cannot be the real reason for deciding to formally announce the free convertibility of the pound sterling. It must be known that officially promising to grant conversion at the official rate is different after all; people holding these pound sterling now no longer have to worry about taking a loss on the exchange rate through semi-black market conversion, and when the British authorities encounter a greater crisis of selling off the pound sterling in the future, they cannot hope to suspend the officially promised conversion, because this will inevitably cause more serious damage to the pound sterling's reputation. Indeed, this approach is very inconsistent with Britain's consistent cautious attitude on the issue of free convertibility.

Therefore, the reason why the pound sterling had to achieve free convertibility at the end of 1958 on the eve of the implementation of the Western European "Common Market" was more passive than active. This largely reflects that the situation in Western Europe today has undergone changes unfavorable to Britain, forcing Britain to take measures for the free convertibility of the pound sterling. And the main source of this pressure is the West German mark.

          The Mark's Pursuit

      In the past six or seven years, among the Western capitalist countries, West Germany's economic strength has grown relatively. With this change, the ambition of West German monopoly capital to expand externally has become increasingly apparent, which has first conflicted with Britain and caused a series of new problems in today's imperialist rivalry.

From 1952 to the third quarter of 1958, West Germany's current international balance of payments had a surplus of $7.8 billion, and its gold and U.S. dollar reserves increased by $4 billion (during the same period, Britain's reserves, if deducting the aforementioned short-term loans and some unpaid debts, only increased by $150 million). In the international market, the West German mark is becoming harder than the pound sterling. Since about 1954, West Germany has been openly expressing its intention to make the mark a fully convertible currency like the U.S. dollar.

The attempt of West German monopoly capital to raise the status of the mark and strive for financial power is closely linked to their imperialist ambitions. Making the mark an internationally used currency, making Frankfurt one of the financial centers of the capitalist world, and establishing West German banks throughout the capitalist world are necessary conditions for West German monopoly capital to carry out external expansion. Because when the mark can be fully and freely converted into any foreign currency, West German capital can flow freely without being restricted by foreign exchange controls, which provides the greatest convenience for West German capital exports.

Not only that. The free convertibility of Western European currencies and the end of the European Payments Union will also bring considerable benefits to West Germany. Because, according to the arrangements of the European Payments Union, surplus countries automatically grant credit to deficit countries. Therefore, until November last year, West Germany had given a total of about $1 billion in loans to the European Payments Union. In this way, this capital of West Germany was tied up in the European Payments Union. This is one aspect. On the other hand, due to the above-mentioned regulations of the European Payments Union, West German monopoly capital did not have the possibility of using this loan through bilateral relations to obtain political and economic privileges. The end of the European Payments Union not only lifted the restrictions on them, but also can immediately exert the role of creditor through the bilateral clearing of past debts and credits, and obtain benefits favorable to West German monopoly capital.

Therefore, since 1954, West Germany has been the most vocal in advocating the free convertibility of Western European currencies. The 1955 "European Monetary Agreement" (preparing to replace the European Payments Union in the future era of free convertibility of Western European currencies) was mainly formulated under such circumstances. However, in the Anglo-German negotiations in 1954, due to British pressure, West Germany agreed not to convert before the pound sterling, and superficially recognized the pound sterling as the leading currency in Western Europe. However, West Germany immediately put forward a slogan: to freely convert the mark "five minutes" after the pound sterling's free convertibility, and the "aggressive" momentum was already not small.

Subsequently, further changes occurred that were beneficial to the mark and unfavorable to the pound sterling: West Germany's external balance of payments continued to have a surplus, but the pound sterling had a crisis for three consecutive years, and the crisis in 1957 was caused by market speculation that the mark would appreciate and the pound sterling would depreciate (at that time, a large amount of funds flowed from Britain to West Germany). In fact, West Germany did not wait for that "five minutes". Especially in the past two years, West Germany has gradually pushed the mark towards conversion. When Western European countries announced limited free convertibility at the end of last year, the mark was already very close to full free convertibility. It is not difficult to imagine that after the implementation of the Western European "Common Market", West Germany, as the largest creditor country and surplus country among the six countries, will try its best to make the mark freely convertible, thereby laying the foundation for West Germany's financial power in continental Western Europe and driving the pound sterling out of the six countries. What can confirm this is that less than two weeks after the Western European countries jointly announced limited convertibility, West Germany further implemented full free convertibility, which Britain could not achieve.

The preparation for the free convertibility of the mark cannot but put great pressure on the pound sterling. The most important and truest reason why Britain was preparing for the pound sterling's convertibility in the autumn of 1958 was to strive for the initiative in such a prospect.

  However, this struggle between the pound sterling and the mark has become more tortuous and complicated due to the quarrel between Britain and France.

        France and Britain Open Fire

    After Western European countries announced free convertibility, the explanations of the British Treasury spokesperson, the debates in the House of Commons, and reports from all sides reflected such a situation: before the end of the year, when Britain probed France and West Germany on the issue of free convertibility, because France expressed that it wanted to devalue the franc on the eve of the implementation of the "Common Market" and at the same time implement a certain degree of free convertibility, Britain had to advance the schedule for the pound sterling's convertibility. The situation may have been like this. However, the franc's need for convertibility really still reflected the challenge of the mark. Because, although France does need to conduct another devaluation before the implementation of the "Common Market" because its industrial products are high in price (and has been preparing for this for a long time), France has a large fiscal deficit and very little foreign exchange reserves. Being able to maintain the stability of the franc after devaluation is already the best of luck. The franc is not a currency with a wide range of circulation. France will not proactively have any requirements for convertibility (and there is no need to convert the franc solely for the pound sterling's convertibility). However, if the mark decides to be freely convertible, it will be difficult for France not to follow suit and implement corresponding free convertibility. Otherwise, France will have to tighten foreign exchange controls on West Germany, like restricting the franc's convertibility to the U.S. dollar to restrict the franc's convertibility to the mark. But if France does this, it will immediately divide the "Common Market" into two from the foreign exchange perspective (the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg are small creditor countries in the European Payments Union, and they have also been demanding the convertibility of Western European currencies in order to end the European Payments Union. Italy's situation is similar to France's), restricting the transfer of currency from some countries to other countries. This will naturally immediately conflict with the plan to lift restrictions on trade and capital flows between the six countries. Former French Foreign Minister Pineau said on the day he announced the franc's convertibility that because some of France's "partners" wanted to be freely convertible, France followed suit and took similar measures. Otherwise, France could not participate in the "Common Market." It can be seen that the announcement of the franc's free convertibility was actually due to the promotion of the mark.

    However, Britain was not without any initiative. Combining the preparations for the struggle for free convertibility, Britain relaxed import controls on the U.S. dollar area in September and declared that it would continue to relax this year. At that time, the dispute between Britain and France on the Western European "Free Trade Area" issue was becoming increasingly deadlocked, and the focus of the dispute was: France insisted that if Britain wanted to share the benefits of the "Common Market" countries relaxing controls and reducing tariffs on each other, then Britain must also jointly abide by the principle of having differential (discriminatory) treatment for countries outside the area, just like the "Common Market" countries. But Britain insisted that its foreign tariffs and trade policies should not be constrained. In addition to wanting to retain preferential trade with Commonwealth countries, Britain's true intention was also ulterior. Therefore, Britain used this to vigorously promote that it was advocating "free trade", while France wanted "protectionism". Britain's practice of relaxing imports of goods from the U.S. dollar area was to show the United States that Britain's "free trade area" proposal would benefit the United States, while accepting France's proposal would mean that U.S. goods would be discriminated against. After the devaluation of the franc, France immediately made an effort to relax some import controls on goods from the U.S. dollar area, which also included a response to Britain's challenge.

    At the same time, Britain's striving to take the initiative to implement the free convertibility of the pound sterling in the prospect of the mark's convertibility also shows that Britain still has some initiative to some extent. British monopoly capital has not tasted hoping that due to the franc's free convertibility, France will have to pay attention to saving expenses, so that French monopoly capital, represented by the de Gaulle government, can rein in its ambitions (including developing nuclear weapons, investing heavily in North Africa, etc.). In the view of British monopoly capital, France's vigorous demand for "great power status" and its alliance with West Germany is a major threat to Britain's position in Western Europe.

    The Situation after the Convertibility of Western European Currencies

    The free convertibility of Britain, France, and West Germany has triggered the free convertibility of other Western European countries. These countries have different specific situations, but in general, a large part of their foreign trade is conducted within Western Europe, so breaking away from the currency measures of the major Western European countries is also unfavorable to themselves.

    This currency war in Western Europe was caused by the increasingly deepening internal economic contradictions in various countries on the basis of the unbalanced development of Western European imperialist countries in recent years. The West German mark is relying on the favorable conditions after the establishment of the "Common Market" to expand its power, and will increasingly participate in the struggle between the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling, creating a certain triangular situation. Although this conflict is manifested as a currency war, it is actually combined with the struggle of monopoly capital in various countries to compete for commodity and investment markets and fully seize spheres of influence. The scope of the struggle will not be limited to a corner of the Western European market. The urgent desire of West German monopoly capital for external expansion will especially arouse fierce contradictions between Britain and West Germany, and will gradually ignite fierce contradictions between the six countries of the "Common Market". At the same time, after the free convertibility of currencies in Western European countries, the struggle to strive for export surpluses will be further launched under the stimulation of maintaining exchange rates.

    The monopoly capital of Western European countries will also inevitably use the situation after convertibility to further try to suppress domestic wages under the pretext of maintaining exchange rates. This will also inevitably make their domestic economic contradictions more acute, and make the economic crises that have arrived and are about to arrive in various countries more profound. This will inevitably in turn prompt them to more fiercely compete for foreign markets.

    U.S. monopoly capital currently obtains certain conveniences for expanding exports from the struggle for currency convertibility in Western Europe. However, if they want to be able to fully enjoy these conveniences, they must first change the current situation where the export prices of U.S. industrial products are generally higher than those of West Germany and Britain. Can the United States insist on not devaluing the U.S. dollar for a long time? It must not be forgotten that Western Europe is conducting free convertibility when U.S. exports are plummeting, $2.3 billion of gold is flowing out in a year, and the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against Western European currencies is weak. Conversely, can the Western European countries that have already carried out convertibility sit idly by and watch the United States re-absorb their reserves? All of this contains the possibility of a greater storm coming in the future.

    The communique of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out: "The contradictions within the imperialist camp are numerous, and their so-called 'unity' is in the process of gradually moving towards its opposite, that is, gradually moving towards division and disintegration. This process may be quite long, but the general trend is inevitable." The currency war that broke out in Western Europe at the end of last year and the resulting increasingly acute situation of contradictions confirm and will continue to confirm this brilliant conclusion.

    从英镑的自由兑换看西欧货币战争  
    姚念庆
    西方资本主义国家间日益强烈的冲突，在金融方面也日益表面化了。1958年底，英、法西德同时宣布了有限度的货币自由兑换，法郎在同时实行贬值，马克在转年不久又进一步实行了全面自由兑换。其它大多数西欧国家跟着采取了大体相同的措施。这是一场十分复杂的斗争。它虽然和多年来的英镑、美元之间的斗争有关，但是引起这场战斗的主要原因却是近年来迅速发展并且由于西欧“共同市场”的建立而激剧化了的英镑对西德马克的斗争。
    英镑美元斗争的老道路
    提起英镑自由兑换，就令人想起1947年英国曾在美国三十七亿五千万美元贷款的压力下被迫实行的那一次较为广泛的英镑自由兑换，结果是不到六星期，英国贮备外流达十亿美元，终于又不得不恢复外汇管制。自那以后，美国一直没有放弃迫使英镑自由兑换的念头，并为此而进行了许多活动。对美国垄断资本说来，如果英镑可以无限制地兑换为美元，也就解除了英镑区对美国的外汇和贸易管制，清扫了他们向英国势力范围扩张的一个重要障碍。但是英国垄断资本却怀着完全不同的目的，也要求在条件有利时——贮备充足、英镑区对外收支稳定——实施英镑自由兑换。在他们看来，一个不能像美元一样可以自由兑换为外国货币的英镑总是不能和美元取得同等地位的。
    提高英镑地位的斗争对英国垄断资本具有非常现实的意义。英镑是一种在国际间广泛使用的货币，伦敦拥有三十三亿英镑的属于外国的存款，如果英镑总是处于比美元软弱和危险的地位，那么人家总会要设法把这些资金转向纽约。这样，一有风吹草动，市场中就会出现抛售英镑的危机，而长期说来，伦敦存款会步步向外转移从而引至英镑区的瓦解。因此，提高英镑地位是英国垄断资本全力以赴的一场战斗，而在条件合适时实现英镑的自由兑换，也是他们的一个长期目标。
    1952年的英联邦总理会议曾经确定了一个关于英镑自由兑换的计划。在那以后，接受了1947年的教训的英国垄断资本，一直在小心翼翼地设法为英镑自由兑换准备条件，并且不断和美国讨价还价。多年的情况表明，他们第一步的目标就是实行英镑有限度的自由兑换（大致说来，这就是允许一切居住在英镑区以外的人把他们赚来的英镑按官价自由兑换为美元，但英镑区居民所持有的英镑则还不能自由兑换，同时在英镑区内的投资也还不能自由撤走）。但是，1955、1956、1957年连着发生了三次英镑危机，这个计划也就被搁置了。
    1958年有一些比较复杂的变化。年初时，英国垄断资本十分害怕美元荒的继续发展，他们害怕各国在美元缺乏的情况下会抛出手中的英镑来在自由市场中换取美元，从而把英镑挤垮。他们正式向美国提出要求，要美国拿出钱来大大增加国际货币基金的信贷，借以缓和各国特别是英镑区贮备不足的情况。但是，1958年内美元荒并没有继续发展，反而转变为美国黄金外流了。在此基础上，英镑区的贮备出现了较大的增长（由1957年9月底到1958年底共增加十二亿美元）。这时加拿大公开提出——这在很大程度上反映着美国的意见——要英镑兑换并且放宽对美元区货物进口管制。此后，8月里艾森豪威尔表示要考虑增加国际货币基金信贷，9月英国宣布放宽英国和殖民地对美元区货物进口管制，10月初英国在国际货币基金年会中谈英镑自由兑换的条件。这一连串的事实表明：如果美国肯把国际货币基金信贷作某些扩大，英国就将进行一定程度的自由兑换。同时在货币市场中出现了英镑准备实行自由兑换的一些迹象。
    以上情况表明着问题的一个方面：英镑这次自由兑换还是沿着英镑美元斗争的老道路。也可以说，英美双方暂时做成了一笔买卖：美国取得某些增加出口的机会（包括其它国家从英镑区赚的英镑现在可以转购美元区货物）；英国取得了一些信贷便利，并在美元疲软的情况下实行部分的英镑自由兑换。此外，对于英国来说，一些原来在国外那种被称作“自由市场”的半黑市中进行的汇兑业务，由于英镑有限度地自由兑换而转至伦敦，也不失为一个从属的利益。
    但是，这次英镑自由兑换决不单是一个对美元的问题。一方面是，美国在1958年并不曾在这个问题上对英国施用怎样大的压力，而另一方面，哪怕是按照英国垄断资本自己的标准，目前英镑自由兑换的条件也是很勉强的。
      勉强的自由兑换
    首先贮备不足。可以拿英镑比较接近自由兑换而并没有能够实现的1954年的情况作一比较。1958年底英国的黄金美元贮备合三十二亿美元，1954年底是二十八亿，但1958年的贮备中有五亿六千万是国际货币基金的短期贷款，还有二亿五千万是由美国进出口银行借的，也是为期不长的信贷。其中至少国际货币基金的贷款在1954年时是能够按该组织的规定取得的，所以1958年底贮备实际比1954年还少。至于国际货币基金信贷虽然有所增加，但为数可怜。该组织理事会主张把各成员国定额增加50％，依照该组织一向贷款的实际情况来看，往好里说也不过能使英国得到六亿五千万美元的信贷便利（相等于这次增加的英国定额），而英国还得先缴纳合自己定额25％即一亿六千万美元的黄金。另一方面，西欧的货币自由兑换结束了欧洲支付同盟，而去年11月底时英国在欧洲支付同盟中还有三亿多美元的信贷好用。这笔账算下来，英国所得好处还不到两亿美元。
    更重要的是，英镑区的对外收支并没有稳定的前景。去年贮备的增加有很大的暂时性。它主要是由于三个原因：第一，过去英镑危机中流出的资金后来流回，这个因素的作用现在已是愈来愈小。第二，由于资本主义世界危机的条件下，原料价格下降，使英国节省了从美元区的进口费用，而英国对美国的出口则由于一些特殊的因素暂时保持在高水平上，所以对美元区收支转顺。但这本身就包含着很大的矛盾。因为，如果美国经济继续下降，迟早会影响英国对美国的出口的；如果美国工业生产能够回升，也是会引起原料价格回涨，从而将提高英国从美元区的进口的价格。所以，在这方面，情况不会对英国继续有利的。第三，其它英镑区各地从世界银行、美国以及西德得到大量贷款，弥补了出口收入的下降，所以1958年它们向伦敦缴纳的黄金美元反而增加了。不过英国垄断资本是不能希望长期依赖这一类贷款而不动摇他们在英镑区中的地位的。
    当然，英镑实行有限度的自由兑换还有着这样一种条件，那就是：从1954年以来在纽约和苏黎士就存在着半黑市，这次开放兑换的那一部分英镑本来就可以从这个半黑市的市场上按比官价为低的汇价转换美元；而且英国官方为了怕过多地影响英镑信誉和防止不利于英国的套购，自1955年起还在这些市场中活动，支持英镑汇价，使不致比官价低得太多。所以，伦敦金融界说，这次英国不过是把事实上已经存在着的自由兑换给予合法化而已，并没有因而增加很多的额外风险。的确，过去几次英镑危机的经验说明，尽管英国没有实行英镑的自由兑换，英镑依然会转换为美元，大量流走。
    但是，这究竟不能成为决定英镑正式宣布自由兑换的真正原因。要知道，官方正式承诺按官价给予兑换究竟是不同的；持有这些英镑的人现在没有了通过半黑市兑换要在汇价上吃点亏的考虑，而英国官方日后遇到更大的抛售英镑的危机时，也不能希望中止已经正式承诺的兑换，因为这就必将使英镑信誉遭到更严重的打击。的确，这次的做法与英国在自由兑换问题上一贯的谨慎态度是很不相称的。
    因此，英镑之所以要在1958年底西欧“共同市场”实施的前夕实现自由兑换，实在是被动的成分大于主动成分。在这很大程度上反映着今日西欧的形势发生了不利于英国的变化，迫使英国不得不采取英镑自由兑换的措施。而这个压力的主要根源就是西德马克。
          马克的追逼
      近六、七年来，在西方资本主义国家中，西德的经济力量相对地增长了。随着这一变化，西德垄断资本对外扩张的野心日益显露，这就首先与英国发生冲突，并在今日帝国主义的角逐中引起一系列的新问题。
    由1952年至1958年第三季度止，西德经常性的国际收支共有七十八亿美元的顺差，黄金美元贮备增加四十亿美元（同期中的英国贮备，如果扣除前述短期借款和一些应还未还的债务，不过增加一亿五千万美元而已）。在国际市场中西德马克愈来愈比英镑硬。大约自1954年起西德就一直公开表示要把马克弄成像美元那样可以完全自由兑换的货币。
    西德垄断资本提高马克地位、争取金融势力的企图紧密地联系着他们的帝国主义野心。把马克搞成一种国际通用的货币，使法兰克福成为资本主义世界金融中心之一，使西德银行遍设资本主义世界各地，这是西德垄断资本进行对外扩张的必要条件。因为在马克可以完全自由地兑换为任何外币时，西德资本就能不受外汇管制的限制而自由流动，也就为西德资本输出提供了最大的便利。
    不止如此。西欧国家货币的自由兑换和欧洲支付同盟的结束，也将为西德带来不小的好处。因为，按照欧洲支付同盟的安排，顺差国自动对逆差国给予信贷。因而，至去年11月为止，西德对欧洲支付同盟一共给了约十亿美元的贷款。这样，西德的这一笔资本就被束缚在欧洲支付同盟里了。这是一方面。另一方面，由于欧洲支付同盟上述的规定，西德垄断资本没有可能通过双边关系来利用这笔贷款，使他们取得政治和经济上的特权。欧洲支付同盟的结束不但对他们解除了束缚，而且通过对过去债权债务的双边清算，立即可以发挥债权的作用，取得有利于西德垄断资本的好处。
    所以，从1954年以来，西德是一直主张西欧货币自由兑换最力的。1955年“欧洲货币协定”（准备日后西欧货币自由兑换时代替欧洲支付同盟）主要就是在这样的情况下订定的。但在1954年的英德谈判中，由于英国的压力，西德应允不抢在英镑之前兑换，并表面承认英镑是西欧的领导货币。但是，西德随即提出一个口号：在英镑自由兑换后“五分钟”把马克自由兑换，“咄咄逼英”的劲头已经不小。
    此后进一步发生了有利于马克、不利于英镑的变化；西德对外收支继续顺差，英镑却一连三年都发生了危机，而且1957年的危机还是由于马克升值、英镑贬值这样一种市场推测引起的（当时有大量资金由英国流往西德）。其实西德也没有等那个“五分钟”，特别是近两年来，西德步步把马克推向兑换，在去年底西欧各国宣布有限度自由兑换时，马克已经十分接近了完全的自由兑换。不难想像，在西欧“共同市场”实施后，作为六国中最大债权国和顺差国的西德要竭力使马克自由兑换，从而奠定西德在西欧大陆的金融势力，把英镑驱出六国之外。可以印证这一点的是：在西欧国家共同宣布有限度的兑换后不到两周，西德就进一步实行了英国力所难及的全面自由兑换。
    马克实行自由兑换的准备，不能不对英镑形成极大的压力。英国之所以在1958年的秋天就在准备着英镑兑换，其最主要的和最真实的原因就是想在这样一个前景中争取主动。
  不过，这次英镑和马克的斗争却由于英法之间的争吵而更为曲折和复杂化了。
        法英开火
    在西欧各国宣布自由兑换以后，英国财政部发言人的说明、下议院的辩论和各方面的报道反映出这样一个情况：年底前当英国就自由兑换问题向法国和西德进行试探时，由于法国表示要在“共同市场”实施前夕把法郎贬值，并同时实行一定程度的自由兑换，因而英国不得不把英镑兑换的日程提前。经过情形也许就是这样。但是法郎要兑换实在还是反映着马克的挑战。因为，法国固然因为自己工业产品的价格高有必要在“共同市场”实施前再进行一次贬值（为此也早在准备），但是法国财政赤字很大，外汇贮备又很少，能保住法郎贬值后的平稳已是上上大吉，法郎又不是一种流通范围很广的货币，法国是不会主动有什么兑换的要求的（也没有必要单是为了英镑兑换而把法郎兑换）。但是，如果马克决定自由兑换，法国就很难不跟着实行相应的自由兑换，否则法国就得加紧对西德的外汇管制，像限制法郎对美元的兑换那样来限制法郎对马克的兑换。但如法国这样做，就立即会从外汇上把“共同市场”分割为二（荷、比、卢三国是欧洲支付同盟中的小债权国，它们也是一向要求西欧货币兑换从而结束欧洲支付同盟的，意大利情况则与法国相近），使其中一部分国家的货币转付给另一部分国家时要遭受限制，这样自然就会立即与取消六国间贸易和资金流动限制的计划发生抵触。前法外长比内在宣布法郎兑换那天说，由于法国的某些“伙伴”要自由兑换，法国跟着采取了类似的措施，否则法国就不能参加“共同市场”。由此可见，法郎的宣布自由兑换，实际上是由于马克的推动。
    但是，在英国方面也不是一点主动性也没有。英国结合着对自由兑换的斗争的准备，在9月就放宽了对美元区的进口管制并且声明将在今年继续放宽。那时正是英法在西欧“自由贸易区”问题上的争执愈来愈成僵局的时候，而争执的焦点是：法国坚持如果英国想分享“共同市场”国家彼此放宽管制和降低关税的好处，那英国也得像“共同市场”国家一样共同遵守对区外国家要有差别（歧视）待遇的原则，而英国则坚持自己的对外关税和贸易政策不受约束。英国的真意除了要保留对英联邦国家的特惠贸易以外也还是别有用心的。因而英国借此大肆宣传，说自己拥护的是“自由贸易”，而法国则要“保护主义”。英国放宽美元区货物进口的做法就是要向美国表示：按照英国“自由贸易区”的主张会使美国得到好处，接受法国的主张则将意味着美国货物将遭受歧视。法国在法郎贬值后也立即勉力放宽了对美元区货物的某些进口管制，这也包含了针对英国的挑战的回答。
    同时，这次英国在马克兑换的前景中，争取主动实行英镑自由兑换，也说明了英国多少还有点主动性。英国垄断资本未尝不盼望由于法郎的自由兑换，法国将不得不注意节省开支，从而可以使以戴高乐政府为代表的法国垄断资本收敛一下自己的野心（包括发展核武器、对北非大量投资等等）。在英国垄断资本看来，法国竭力要求“大国地位”，并为此和西德结成联盟，这是对英国在西欧地位的一大威胁。
    西欧货币兑换后的形势
    英、法、西德的自由兑换引起了其它西欧国家的自由兑换。这些国家各自具体情况不同，但总的说来，它们对外贸易的很大部分是在西欧内部进行的，因而脱离了西欧主要国家的货币措施对自己也是不利的。
    这次西欧的货币战争，是在近年来西欧帝国主义国家不平衡发展的基础上，由于各国内部经济矛盾日益加深而促成的。西德马克正在凭借着“共同市场”建立后的有利条件扩大势力，并将日益参与美元和英镑的斗争，造成某种三角形势。这次的冲突虽然表现为货币战争，但实际结合着各国垄断资本争夺商品和投资市场以及全面夺取势力范围的斗争，其斗争范围也将不限于西欧市场一隅。西德垄断资本对外扩张的急迫愿望特别将在英国和西德间并将逐步在“共同市场”六国间激起剧烈的矛盾。同时西欧各国货币自由兑换后，在维持汇价的刺激下也将进一步展开争取出口顺差的斗争。
    西欧各国的垄断资本还必然要利用兑换后的形势，以维持汇价为借口来进一步设法压低国内工资。这也必然会使他们国内的经济矛盾更尖锐，使各国已经到来和即将到来的经济危机更为深刻。这也必然要反过来促使他们更加剧烈地去争夺国外市场。
    美国垄断资本目前从西欧货币兑换的斗争中得到了扩大出口的某些便利条件。但是，他们要想能够充分享受这些便利，还得先改变一下现在美国工业品的出口价格已经一般地高于西德和英国的状况。美国能够长期坚持不把美元贬值吗？不能忘记，西欧是在美国出口猛降，一年流出二十三亿美元的黄金，美元对西欧货币汇价疲软的时候进行自由兑换的。反过来，已经进行了兑换的西欧国家，又能坐视美国重新把它们的贮备吸走吗？这一切都包藏着日后更大风暴来临的可能性。
    中国共产党八届六中全会的公报中指出：“帝国主义阵营内部矛盾重重，他们的所谓‘团结’，正处于逐步走向反面即逐步走向四分五裂的过程中，这个过程可能还相当长，但是总的趋势是不可避免的。”去年年底西欧爆发的货币战争和因此而进一步激化了的矛盾形势，证实着并将继续证实着这个英明论断。
