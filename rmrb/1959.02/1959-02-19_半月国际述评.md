Half-Monthly International Review
February 1st to 15th

The Far-Reaching Impact of the 21st Congress of the CPSU

The 21st Extraordinary Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which attracted the attention of all people around the world, successfully concluded on February 5th. The report and concluding remarks made by Comrade Khrushchev at the Congress, as well as the resolutions adopted by the Congress, summarized the rich experience of Soviet socialist construction and put forward a grand program for the comprehensive development of communism in the Soviet Union. The 21st Congress of the CPSU will be recorded in the annals of the communist movement as a new milestone in mankind's march towards communism.

The Soviet Seven-Year Plan adopted by the 21st Congress of the CPSU showcases the magnificent prospect of a communist society. The scale of this plan is unprecedented. In seven years, the Soviet Union's industrial production will advance at an average annual growth rate of 8.6%, increasing the overall industrial output by 80%. Relying on this speed, after another five years or less, the Soviet Union will surpass the United States in terms of the absolute output of certain major products and the per capita output, and will leap to the first place in the world.

The ambitious goals of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan have sparked widespread commentary in countries around the world. Due to the historical fact that the Soviet economy has been advancing rapidly for decades, even the bourgeois public opinion in Western countries, for the most part, cannot help but acknowledge the reality of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan. The British "Daily Mail" wrote: "The Soviet people have more than enough ability to complete Khrushchev's targets." Many bourgeois economists in the United States also believe that the Soviet Seven-Year Plan is quite realistic, and its indicators for developing the national economy are achievable. Even Dulles could only say: "There is no way to stop Russia's remarkable industrial development."

The Soviet Seven-Year Plan is of great significance for the struggle to defend peace. The strong economic power displayed by the plan itself makes it a powerful factor in maintaining peace and demonstrates the Soviet Union's peaceful intentions. No one can deny that such a large-scale construction plan can only be completed in a peaceful environment. The Burmese "Vanguard" pointed out: "Considering that the Soviet Union has formulated such a seven-year plan that requires about 3 trillion rubles, people can clearly estimate their desire for peace and to stop war." The peaceful nature of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan, as well as the principles of the Soviet peaceful foreign policy reiterated by Comrade Khrushchev at the 21st Congress of the CPSU, have greatly promoted the struggle to maintain world peace.

Imperialism's Dismay and Unease

The great achievements of the 21st Congress of the CPSU shocked the Western world. Because the Seven-Year Plan adopted at this Congress brought the economic competition between socialism and capitalism into a new stage, and the powerful current of peace emanating from the rostrum of the Congress is exerting a powerful impact on the imperialist "Cold War" policy.

The various reactions of Western bourgeois public opinion reveal their dismay and unease! They almost unanimously exclaimed that "the West's economic advantage" is gone forever, and their hearts are filled with fear that the capitalist economy will suffer defeat in the economic competition between the two systems. The "New York Times," when comparing the economic development speeds of the Soviet Union and the United States, had to express "disappointment" with the speed of economic development in the United States, and believed that Khrushchev's estimate of an average annual growth rate of 2% in U.S. industrial production was still "perhaps too kind. Because since the end of the Korean War, the annual rate of economic development in our country (the United States) has averaged less than 1.5%." At a recent meeting of the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress, U.S. AFL-CIO Vice President Reuther stated that the speed of U.S. production development was simply "comparable to the movement of a snail."

In fact, the economic crisis in the capitalist world is deepening. The number of unemployed people in the United States increased by 616,000 in January of this year, bringing the total number of unemployed in the United States close to the 5 million mark again, reaching the highest figure since the economic crisis in April last year. In the United Kingdom, the current number of unemployed people is more than 660,000, reaching the highest figure since the fuel crisis in February 1947; steel production in January of this year also decreased compared to the same period last year, and it is well known that British steel production in 1958 was already significantly lower than the previous year.

The economic situation in the United States and the United Kingdom is such that in the economic lives of other capitalist countries, there are also gloomy pictures of varying degrees. This forms a strong contrast to the prosperity and progress of socialist countries.

The people of the world, encouraged by the strongest voice for peace from the 21st Congress of the CPSU, are exerting increasing pressure on the imperialist countries, led by the United States, to abandon the "Cold War" policy and reasonably resolve major international issues such as the German question, disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing, the development of international trade, and the improvement of East-West relations. The "Cold War" positions built by U.S. imperialism and its partners on all these issues are becoming increasingly difficult to defend, and their positions are becoming increasingly passive.

Western Group Fissures Continue to Increase

As everyone knows, the latest initiative put forward by the Soviet Union on the German question has won the unanimous support of the people of the world. Faced with the enormous pressure of the domestic and international situation, Western countries have found it difficult to continue to adhere to the rigid attitude of rudely rejecting Soviet proposals. As the American "Christian Science Monitor" pointed out: "None of them (referring to Western countries) are truly willing to change the past Western policy towards Germany, but everyone recognizes that this policy is hopelessly outdated."

In this situation, the United States attempted to change its strategy, "exploring possible counter-proposals to the Soviet German plan" (Associated Press) in order to "seize the diplomatic initiative from Moscow without abandoning fundamental principles" (British "Sunday Times"). In other words, the United States intends to shift the responsibility for delaying the resolution of the German question to the Soviet Union in order to escape the passive position of the United States.

However, America's partners each have their own plans. In order to coordinate the differences between the allies and discuss countermeasures on the German question, Dulles made a five-day "lightning" visit to Western Europe from February 4th to 8th. But according to foreign dispatches, Dulles did not get the results he hoped for. Britain clearly has its own set of ideas on the German question; Macmillan's announcement that he would visit the Soviet Union on February 21st indicates that Britain is no longer willing to be completely bound by the United States in its relations with the Soviet Union. France's de Gaulle took a cold attitude towards Dulles' "flexible" plan for German policy; and, according to UPI, de Gaulle re-proposed the issue of France sharing leadership of the North Atlantic group as a condition for guaranteeing Western unity. After Dulles visited Bonn, the Adenauer regime in West Germany continued to clamor "never to give in." Therefore, Dulles' spokesman could only admit that Dulles' trip to Western Europe did not make "any fundamental change in anyone's attitude," and "the Western allies still do not have a detailed plan on how to deal with the Soviet challenge to the Berlin problem." Although Dulles reached an agreement with the Western bloc on the point of holding negotiations with the Soviet Union, there are still major differences within the Western bloc on the question of what unified countermeasures to take.

Dulles' trip to Western Europe fully illustrates that the American leader can no longer control his partners as he pleases, and the so-called "Western unity" is increasingly becoming a slogan on paper. Of course, they may continue to achieve temporary unity in obstructing a peaceful resolution of the German question in order to set up new "Cold War" ice blocks in this regard. But it is believed that these ice blocks will eventually be washed away by the warm current of peace.

    半月国际述评
    二月一日到十五日
    苏共21大的深远影响
    吸引了全世界一切人们的注意力的苏联共产党第二十一次非常代表大会，于2月5日胜利闭幕了。赫鲁晓夫同志在大会上所作的报告和总结发言，以及大会所通过的决议，总结了苏联社会主义建设的丰富经验，提出了苏联全面展开共产主义建设的宏伟纲领。苏共第二十一次代表大会将作为人类向共产主义前进的新的里程碑，记载在共产主义运动的史册上。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会所通过的苏联七年计划，展现了共产主义社会的壮丽远景。这个计划的规模是史无前例的。在七年内，苏联的工业生产将要以平均每年增长8.6％的速率前进，使整个工业产量增加80％。依靠着这种速度，在七年计划完成时，苏联的某些最主要产品的绝对产量将超过美国现在的工业生产水平。在这个基础上，再经过五年或者更短时间，苏联就会在工业产品的绝对产量和按人口平均计算的产量方面，压倒美国而跃居世界第一位。
    苏联七年计划的宏伟目标，在世界各国引起了广泛的评论。由于苏联经济几十年来一往直前飞速发展的历史事实，即使西方国家的资产阶级舆论，现在绝大部分也不能不承认苏联七年计划的现实性。英国“每日邮报”写道：“苏联人民的能力要完成赫鲁晓夫的指标是绰绰有余的”。美国的许多资产阶级经济学家也认为苏联的七年计划相当现实，它的发展国民经济的指标数字是可以达到的。甚至杜勒斯都只能说：“没有办法去制止俄国的引人注目的工业发展”。
    苏联七年计划对于保卫和平的斗争具有十分重大的意义。这个计划本身所显示的强大经济力量使它成为维护和平的有力因素，并且表明了苏联的和平意图。谁也无法否认，像这样一个规模宏大的建设计划，只有在和平的环境下才能完成。缅甸“先锋报”就曾指出：“考虑到苏联制定了这样一项需要三万亿卢布左右的七年计划，人们就可以清楚地估计出他们希望和平，希望制止战争的愿望。”苏联七年计划的和平性质，以及赫鲁晓夫同志在苏共第二十一次代表大会上所重申的苏联和平外交政策的原则，对维护世界和平的斗争发生了巨大的推动作用。
    帝国主义惊惶不安
    苏共第二十一次代表大会的伟大成就震惊了西方世界。因为，在这次代表大会上所通过的七年计划，把社会主义同资本主义的经济竞赛带入了一个新阶段，而从代表大会的讲坛上所发出的一股强大的和平暖流，正使帝国主义的“冷战”政策遭受有力的冲击。
    在形形色色的西方资产阶级舆论的反应中，可以看出他们的惊慌不安！他们几乎是众口一词地惊呼“西方的经济优势”已经一去不复返，并且内心充满着对资本主义经济将在两种制度的经济竞赛中遭受失败的恐惧。“纽约时报”在对比苏美两国经济发展速度时，不得不表示对美国经济发展速度的“失望”，并且认为赫鲁晓夫所估计的美国工业生产每年平均增长率为2％还是“未免太客气了。因为自从朝鲜战争结束以来，我国（美国）每年的经济发展速度……平均不到1.5％”。美国劳联—产联副主席路德最近在美国国会两院经济委员会的会议上发言时，认为美国生产发展的速度简直“可以同蜗牛的行动相比美”。
    事实上，资本主义世界的经济危机正在走向深刻化。美国的失业人数在今年1月份内增加了六十一万六千人，使美国失业者总数又接近了五百万人的大关，达到了去年4月经济危机以来的最高数字。在英国，目前的失业人数已有六十六万多人，达到了1947年2月燃料危机以来的最高数字；今年1月份的钢产量又比去年同期下降，而大家知道，1958年的英国钢产量本来已经是大大低于前年的。
    美国和英国的经济状况是如此，在其他资本主义国家的经济生活中，也展现程度不同的暗淡的图景。这同社会主义各国的繁荣进步，形成了强烈的对照。
    世界人民受到苏共第二十一次代表大会的和平最强音的鼓舞，正以越来越大的压力，要求以美国为首的帝国主义国家放弃“冷战”政策，合理解决关于德国问题、裁减军备、禁止核武器试验、发展国际贸易和改善东西方关系等重大国际问题。美帝国主义和它的伙伴们在所有这些问题上所筑起的“冷战”阵地，越来越难以固守，它们的地位越来越被动了。
      西　方　集　团　分　歧　续　增
    大家知道，苏联在德国问题上所提出的最新倡议，已经获得了世界人民的一致支持。西方国家面对着国内外形势的巨大压力，已经难于继续坚持粗暴拒绝苏联建议的僵硬态度。正如美国“基督教科学箴言报”所指出的：“它们（指西方国家）没有一个真正愿意改变过去的西方对德政策，但是大家都认识到，这个政策是毫无希望地过时了”。
    在这种情况下，美国企图改变策略，“探求对苏联的德国计划的种种可能的反建议”（美联社），以便“在不放弃基本原则的情况下从莫斯科夺取外交主动权”（英国“星期日泰晤士报”）。换句话说，美国打算把拖延解决德国问题的责任转嫁于苏联，以摆脱美国的被动地位。
    然而，美国的伙伴们都各自有着自己的打算。为了协调盟国之间的分歧，商量在德国问题上的对策，杜勒斯于2月4日至8日赴西欧作了五天“闪电式”的访问。但据外电透露，杜勒斯并没有得到他所希望的结果。英国在德国问题上显然有自己的一套想法；麦克米伦宣布要在2月21日访问苏联，表明英国在同苏联的关系上已不再愿完全受美国的束缚。法国的戴高乐以冷淡态度对待杜勒斯的对德政策的“灵活”计划；并且，据合众国际社报道，戴高乐重新提出了法国分享北大西洋集团领导权的问题，作为保证西方团结的交换条件。西德阿登纳政权在杜勒斯访问波恩后，继续叫嚣“决不让步”。因此，杜勒斯的发言人也只能承认杜勒斯的西欧之行没有使“任何人的态度有任何根本改变”，“西方盟国仍然没有一项如何对付苏联对柏林问题的挑战的详细计划”。杜勒斯虽然使西方集团在同苏联举行谈判这一点上取得了协议，但是西方集团在究竟采取什么一致对策的问题上，还是存在着很大的分歧。
    杜勒斯西欧之行充分说明，美国盟主已不能顺心如意地驾御它的伙伴们，所谓“西方团结”越来越成为纸面上的口号。当然，在阻碍和平解决德国问题上，他们仍然可能继续取得暂时的一致，以便在这方面设置新的“冷战”冰块。但是，人们相信，这种冰块最后终于要被和平暖流所冲垮的。
