Building a Flying Spring
Poem by Zhang Daohong, Anlu, Hubei. Painting by Zhou Lingzhao.

    Splitting the hanging cliffs and carving the riverbed,
    Flying springs are erected on the mountains east and west.
    The flowing water rushes through the air,
    Like the Weaver Girl plucking silk strings.

    架飞泉
    湖北安陆　张道宏诗　周令钊画
    劈开悬岩凿开川，
    东西山上架飞泉，
    流水哗哗空中走，
    好似织女弹丝弦。
