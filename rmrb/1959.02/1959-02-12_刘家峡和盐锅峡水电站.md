Liujiaxia is 100 kilometers away from Lanzhou. The Liujiaxia Hydropower Station project will build a 148-meter-high dam in the canyon. A large reservoir will be formed upstream of the dam. At normal water level, the reservoir area will be 130 square kilometers, and the reservoir capacity will be 5.7 billion cubic meters. The hydropower station will have a water turbine generator capacity of 1.05 million kilowatts, and can generate an average of 5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually for use in Lanzhou. The water from the reservoir can also irrigate 15.8 million mu of farmland between Lanzhou and Baotou, and maintain 830 kilometers of navigation from Yinchuan to Qingshuihe. The reservoir can also regulate floods and reduce the threat of floods to Lanzhou.

The Liujiaxia Hydropower Station project has been surveyed since 1952, explored since 1955, and completed the preliminary design in June 1958. In September of the same year, the Liujiaxia Hydropower Engineering Bureau was established, and the project officially started construction. In 1959, in addition to continuing to complete the diversion tunnel and all preparatory works, it will also build underground power plants and complete cofferdam closure and dam foundation excavation, striving to start power generation before the end of 1960.

Yanguoxia is 30 kilometers downstream of Liujiaxia and 70 kilometers away from Lanzhou. The dam of the Yanguoxia Hydropower Station is 53 meters high. At normal high water level, the reservoir capacity is 220 million cubic meters. The dry season flow relies on the regulation of the Liujiaxia Reservoir. The installed capacity of the power station is 600,000 kilowatts, and the average annual power generation is 2.9 billion kilowatt-hours.

The Yanguoxia Reservoir project also started on September 27, 1958. In the past three months or so, 440,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work have been completed, and the first phase of the cofferdam project on the right bank has been completed. Before the flood season of 1959, efforts will be concentrated on completing the excavation of the dam foundation on the right bank, the pouring of the overflow dam comb teeth, the gravity dam on the right bank slope, and the second phase of the cofferdam closure, striving to complete the overflow dam and the installation of the first batch of units after the flood season, and to start power generation by the end of this year.

    刘家峡和盐锅峡水电站
    刘家峡离兰州一百公里。刘家峡水电站工程，要在峡内筑成一百四十八公尺高的拦河坝，坝的上游将形成一个大水库；正常水位时，水库面积为一百三十平方公里，水库容量为五十七亿公方。电站安装的水轮发电机容量为一百零五万瓩，每年平均可发电五十亿度，供兰州使用。水库的水还可以灌溉兰州到包头间共一千五百八十万亩的农田，可以维持银川到清水河段长八百三十公里的航运。水库又能调节洪水，减轻洪水对兰州市的威胁。
    刘家峡水电站工程，从1952年起就进行查勘，1955年开始勘测，1958年6月完成初步设计。同年9月，刘家峡水电工程局成立，工程正式施工。1959年除继续完成导流隧洞和所有准备工程外，还将建设地下厂房，完成围堰截流、坝基开挖等工程，争取在1960年底以前开始发电。
    盐锅峡在刘家峡下游三十公里处，离兰州七十公里。盐锅峡水电站的拦河大坝高五十三公尺，正常高水位时，水库容量为二亿二千万公方，枯水流量有赖刘家峡水库调剂。电站装机容量为六十万瓩，每年平均可发电二十九亿度。
    盐锅峡水库工程也是在1958年9月27日开工的。去年三个多月的时间内，已完成土石方四十四万公方，并且完成了右岸第一期围堰工程。1959年汛期以前，将集中力量完成右岸坝基开挖、溢流坝梳齿浇筑、右岸岸坡重力坝和二期围堰截流等工程，争取在汛期以后完成溢流坝和第一批机组安装工程，在今年年底开始发电。
