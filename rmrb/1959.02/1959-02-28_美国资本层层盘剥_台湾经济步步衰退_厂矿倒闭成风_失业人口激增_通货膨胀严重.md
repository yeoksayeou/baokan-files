Xinhua News Agency, February 27th: American capital is intensifying its control and plunder of the Taiwanese economy, leaving Taiwan's financial situation facing even greater difficulties. Even Chiang Kai-shek's "Minister of Economic Affairs," Yang Chi-tseng, when discussing how to save Taiwan's economic crisis, said that they cannot rely on "American aid" in the long term and must "take the road of an independent economy."

Since the Taiwan authorities began accepting "American aid," there has been no development in production and construction, but rather a step-by-step decline. Last year, the annual output of various major industrial products did not reach the predetermined targets. This year, the output of coal, gold, ammonium sulfate, textiles, and many light industrial products has decreased compared to last year.

The trend of factory and business closures in Taiwan has intensified year by year over the past three years. In 1957, 424 factories, mines, and shops closed down throughout Taiwan. Last year, the number of closures reached about 2,000. Tens of thousands of Taiwanese workers and staff have continuously joined the ranks of the unemployed due to factory and shop closures. Meanwhile, according to Taiwan's "Credit News," the hidden unemployment population in Taiwan's rural areas exceeds two million, which is due to the bankruptcy of Taiwan's rural areas under American exploitation. For example, sugarcane, pineapples, bananas, and tea, which occupy an important position in Taiwan's economy, have been continuously declining in recent years. Last year, the planting area of sugarcane decreased by more than 400,000 mu, and the planting area of tea decreased by more than 200,000 mu, a decrease of more than half compared to the planting area of sugarcane and tea in 1957.

Taiwan's inflation is also intensifying year by year. By the end of January this year, the amount of Taiwan currency issued had exceeded 2.4 billion yuan, an increase of more than 74 times compared to the amount of New Taiwan Dollars issued at the end of June 1949. Taiwan's prices have also been rising year by year. Especially in the past three months, the prices of many goods have risen by more than 50%, and the lives of the Taiwanese people have fallen into a deeper abyss of hardship.

According to Taiwan newspapers, the crux of this serious situation in Taiwan is mainly due to the intrusion of American monopoly capital into Taiwan, which has controlled the economic lifeline of Taiwan. The United States, through "American aid" agencies, implements "supervision" over the Chiang Kai-shek group, so that Taiwan's annual budget and all major financial and economic measures must be approved by the Taiwan branch of the United States International Cooperation Administration, thereby directly manipulating Taiwan's economic power. On the other hand, the United States also manipulates Taiwan's industrial production sectors through various tricks such as "industrial construction assistance" and "development fund loans." In Taiwan's sugar and salt industries, American capital accounts for more than 60% each. Taiwan's electricity, transportation, man-made fibers, chemical fertilizers, paper making, food, and more than 20 other major enterprises have all been penetrated and controlled by American capital. Recently, American capitalists who "invested" in Taiwan have further coerced the Chiang Kai-shek group to revise the "Foreign Investment Regulations" and demanded that the Taiwan authorities give them more preferential conditions in order to unscrupulously plunder wealth in Taiwan, otherwise, they will threaten to withdraw their "investment" in Taiwan. Not only that, but the United States is also dumping goods into Taiwan on a large scale, which has further deepened Taiwan's production contraction and economic difficulties. The United States and the Taiwan authorities signed a trade agreement last year, which forced the Chiang Kai-shek group to purchase more than 10 million US dollars worth of surplus agricultural products from the United States at high prices in one go. At the same time, the United States also dumped goods worth more than 75.8 million US dollars to Taiwan in the name of "assistance," causing a serious trade deficit in Taiwan's import and export trade.

### 美国资本层层盘剥　台湾经济步步衰退  厂矿倒闭成风　失业人口激增　通货膨胀严重

    美国资本层层盘剥　台湾经济步步衰退
    厂矿倒闭成风　失业人口激增　通货膨胀严重
    新华社27日讯　美国对台湾经济加紧控制和掠夺，使台湾财政经济面临更加困难的处境。蒋介石集团“经济部长”杨继曾在谈到如何挽救台湾经济上危机的时候，也说不能长期依赖“美援”，要“走独立经济的道路”。
    台湾当局自从接受“美援”以来，在生产建设上不但没有发展，而且步步衰退。去年各项主要工业品的年产量都没有达到预定的指标。今年煤、金、硫酸錏、纺织和许多轻工业品的产量，都比去年减少。
    台湾工商业倒闭之风，在近三年来是年盛一年。1957年，台湾全省倒闭的厂矿、商店有四百二十四家，去年倒闭的就多达二千家左右。成千上万的台湾工人和职员，因工厂、商店倒闭而不断走进失业者的队伍。同时，据台湾“征信新闻”消息，隐藏在台湾农村的失业人口，数在二百万以上，这是由于台湾农村在美国压榨下破产。例如在台湾经济中占重要地位的甘蔗、菠萝、香蕉和茶叶等，近几年不断减产。去年甘蔗的种植面积减少了四十多万亩，茶叶种植面积减少了二十多万亩，比1957年的甘蔗和茶叶的种植面积，减少了一半以上。
    台湾的通货膨胀也在年年加剧。到今年1月底，台币发行额已超过二十四亿元，比1949年6月底的新台币发行额，增加了七十四倍多。台湾物价也跟着年年上涨，尤其是最近三个多月来，许多货物的价格上涨了50％以上，台湾人民的生活更加陷入了困苦的深渊。
    据台湾报纸透露，造成台湾这种严重情况的症结，主要是由于美国垄断资本侵入台湾，控制了台湾的经济命脉。美国通过“美援”机构，对蒋介石集团执行“监督”，使台湾每年的预算和一切重大的财政经济措施，都要经过美国国际合作署台湾分署的同意，从而直接操纵台湾的经济大权。另一方面，美国又通过所谓“工业建设援助”和
  “开发基金贷款”等各种花招，操纵台湾的工业生产部门。在台湾制糖和制盐工业中，美国资本各占60％以上。台湾的电力、交通运输业、人造纤维、化学肥料、造纸、食品等二十多项主要企业，无一不被美国资本所渗透和控制。最近在台湾“投资”的美国资本家们又进一步胁迫蒋介石集团修改“外国人投资条例”，要台湾当局给予他们更多的优惠条件，以便在台湾无限制地搜刮财富，否则就以收回在台湾的“投资”为要挟。不仅如此，美国还大肆向台湾倾销商品，更加深了台湾生产萎缩和经济困难。美国和台湾当局在去年签订了一项贸易协定，一次就逼着蒋介石集团以高价向美国购买了一千多万美元的剩余农产品。同时，美国还以“援助”为名，向台湾倾销了总值达七千五百八十多万美元的商品，造成台湾进出口贸易的严重入超。
