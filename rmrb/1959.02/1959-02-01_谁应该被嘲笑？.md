    Who Should Be Mocked?
    Bei Hai
    To engage in large-scale experimentation is a characteristic of the Great Leap Forward. This is indeed a manifestation of the broad masses liberating their minds and establishing a communist style of daring to think, speak, and act. Since it is an experiment, failures are inevitable. This is not a problem, because we have a principle to follow: we will never blindly promote an experiment before it is proven successful. Therefore, it will not cause losses to the cause of socialist construction.
    If we experiment with things that predecessors have not done, failures are unavoidable. This is a normal phenomenon. Looking at the history of scientific development, which major invention has not had multiple failures in the process of experimentation?
    There are two attitudes towards all experiments: revolutionaries and promoters are full of enthusiasm, helping them to summarize experiences and lessons, and encouraging them to make persistent efforts. However, right-leaning conservatives want to mock them, saying they are acting recklessly. Their logic is: it is better to stagnate than to take the "risk" of failure by experimenting; weren't we living well yesterday by following the old rules? If humanity had acted according to this principle since the beginning of history, perhaps we would still be in the era of drinking blood!
    Two attitudes: one is active creation, one is seeking temporary ease; one is discovering objective laws that predecessors have not discovered in the process of experimentation, and the other is lying down and doing nothing. Who exactly should be mocked?

    谁应该被嘲笑？
    北海
    大搞试验，是大跃进中的一个特色。这确是广大群众解放了思想，树立了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格的一种表现。既是试验，就免不了有失败。这不要紧，我们还有一条管着：未经证实试验成功，决不盲目推广。所以也就不会给社会主义建设事业造成损失。
    前人没有做过的事，我们来试验，不可免的会有失败。这是正常现象。打开科学发展史来看一看，哪一项重大发明，不是在试验过程中有过多次的失败呢？
    对待一切试验，有两种态度：革命者、促进派，是满腔热情，帮助他们总结经验教训，鼓励他们再接再厉。而右倾保守主义者却要嘲笑他们。说他们蛮干。他们的逻辑是：宁肯停滞不前，也不要冒着失败的“危险”搞试验；昨天按照老规矩，日子不也过来了吗？如果人类从有史以来，都按照这个原则办事，说不定现在还处在茹毛饮血的时代啦！
    两种态度：一种是积极创造，一种是苟且偷安；一种是在试验摸索过程中，去发现前人未曾发现的客观规律，一种是躺倒不干。究竟谁应该被嘲笑呢？
