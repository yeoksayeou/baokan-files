    Thoughts on an Untitled Piece
    Zhong Huai
    Some things seem small, but are actually very big.
    Recently, Shanghai's commercial departments have been focusing on "small services," mobilizing various industries to repair and provide replacements for various daily necessities for the general public, such as mending clothes and shoes, replacing collars and cuffs on cotton and woolen sweaters, providing knife and scissor sharpening, replacing thermos bottle liners and window glass, repairing clocks, radios, leather goods, zippers, toilets, cooking utensils, and enamelware...
    What is especially commendable is that many stores that never used to offer repair services (including some famous stores) have also added repair services. Many stores not only "accept all comers" for repair services, but also "deliver services to the door," organizing manpower to go deep into factories, neighborhoods, government offices, and schools to actively solicit business, repairing and mending as much as possible on the spot. And there is no shortage of thoughtful people who, when going to factories and government offices, never forget to make a special trip to the single dormitories.
    It is a "small service," but it solves many problems in people's daily lives, saves people a lot of time, and brings great convenience to the people.
    Without the great ambition to serve the people, how could one focus on such "trivial" things as repairing, mending, and replacing, especially things that are "low in income and high in trouble"?
    Without the utmost concern for people, how could one be so attentive to people's needs? How could one be so thoughtful and proactive in meeting those needs?
    Can we really say that "small service" is a "small" service?

    有些事情看来很小，其实很大。
    上海商业部门最近大抓“小服务”工作，发动各行各业为广大市民修配各种日常用品，像缝补衣服鞋子，调换棉毛衫领头袖口，代磨刀剪，配热水瓶胆、门窗玻璃，修理钟表、收音机、皮件、拉链、马桶、炊事用具、搪瓷制品……
    尤其可贵的是，很多过去从来不做修补业务的商店（包括一些有名的商店在内），也增加了修补业务；不少商店对于修补业务不仅“来者不拒”，而且“送上门去”，组织人力深入到工厂、里弄、机关、学校主动揽活，尽可能当场修好补好。并且不乏这样的有心人，在到工厂、机关去的时候，总是忘不了要特别到单身宿舍去走一圈。
    是“小服务”，但是它为人们解决了日常生活上的许多难题，节省了人们许多时间，给人们带来了大便利。
    如果没有为人民服务的大志，怎会把修修、补补、配配这种“鸡毛蒜皮”的事情，而且是“收入少、麻烦多”的事情放在眼中？
    如果没有对人的极大的关心，怎会对人的需要体察得那么细致入微？怎会对满足这种需要设想得那么周到，做得那么主动？
    能说“小服务”真是“小”的服务么？
