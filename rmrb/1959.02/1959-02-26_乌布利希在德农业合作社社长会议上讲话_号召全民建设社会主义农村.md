Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 23rd: The Sixth National Conference of Heads and Activists of Agricultural Production Cooperatives of the German Democratic Republic, which lasted for three days, closed in Leipzig on the 22nd.

The conference unanimously approved the "Report Outline on the Issue of Agricultural Production Cooperatives Submitted to the Sixth National Conference of Heads and Activists of Agricultural Production Cooperatives by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the Committee on Agricultural Production Cooperatives of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry." The conference also adopted the draft regulations for agricultural production cooperatives and the draft model charter for agricultural production cooperatives.

Speaking at the conference on the 22nd was Mückenberger, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. When discussing the current tasks of agricultural production cooperatives, he said that the main focus should be on absorbing middle peasants into agricultural production cooperatives and maximizing the productivity of agricultural products. He pointed out that attention should be paid to strengthening the comradely relations between members of agricultural production cooperatives and individual farmers.

Mückenberger emphasized: In the peaceful competition, we must surpass West Germany in terms of production levels per hundred hectares of land and product output per capita in agricultural production.

Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, made a concluding speech at the closing session.

When discussing the issue of agricultural production cooperatives, he said that the task of the production team leaders of agricultural production cooperatives is not only to direct production but also to help members improve their scientific knowledge. The ten-year comprehensive technical education currently being prepared is to improve people's production knowledge.

Ulbricht particularly emphasized the importance of changing working styles and promoting mass consciousness and enthusiasm. He said that everyone should participate in building a socialist countryside, and all cadres should pay attention to the progressive factors among the masses. In the future, the state should reduce investment in certain areas, but the work should be done better, more consultations should be held with the working people, and more local enthusiasm should be brought into play.

When discussing the German question, Ulbricht said that Adenauer did not answer a single word to the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany, and he attempted to divert world attention from West Germany and West Berlin, which are hotbeds of war. However, we must start with the issue of this dangerous place.

Ulbricht then discussed the issues after the signing of the peace treaty with Germany. He said that disarmament can be carried out through mutual understanding. If West Germany disarms, the danger of war will be reduced.

Ulbricht said that the different social systems do not prevent German reunification. We are working for peace, but Adenauer does not talk about peace. On the contrary, he is launching an anti-communist high tide. Ulbricht added that the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany and the proposals of the German Democratic Republic both propose eliminating militarism in Germany, which is the desire of all peace-loving people.

Ulbricht also emphasized that if West Germany withdraws from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the German Democratic Republic will withdraw from the Warsaw Pact.

    乌布利希在德农业合作社社长会议上讲话
    号召全民建设社会主义农村
    新华社柏林23日电　历时三天的德意志民主共和国全国第六届农业生产合作社社长和积极分子会议22日在来比锡闭幕。
    会议一致赞同“德国统一社会党中央政治局、德意志民主共和国部长会议农业生产合作社问题委员会和农林部提交第六届农业生产合作社社长和积极分子会议的报告提纲”，会议还通过了农业生产合作社条例草案和农业生产合作社示范章程草案。
    在22日会议上讲话的有德国统一社会党中央政治局委员穆肯贝格尔。他在谈到农业生产合作社当前的任务时说，主要的注意力应当放在吸收中农参加农业生产合作社和最大限度地提高农业产品的生产率方面。他指出，要注意加强农业生产合作社社员同个体农民之间的同志关系。
    穆肯贝格尔强调说：在和平竞赛中，我们在农业生产中要在每一百公顷土地的生产水平方面和按人口平均计算的产品产量方面超过西德。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希在闭幕会上作了总结发言。
    他在谈到农业生产合作社问题时说，农业生产合作社的生产队长的任务不只是指挥生产，还要帮助社员提高科学知识水平，目前准备实行的十年制综合技术教育，就是为提高人们的生产知识水平。
    乌布利希特别强调改变工作作风和发扬群众自觉性和积极性的重要性。他说，应该使所有的人都来参加建立社会主义农村，所有干部都应该注意群众中进步的因素。以后，国家在某些方面的投资要减少，但工作应该做得更好，要多和劳动人民商量，多发挥地方积极性。
    乌布利希在谈到德国问题的时候说，阿登纳对苏联提出的对德和约草案没有回答一句话，他企图转移世界对西德和西柏林这个战争策源地的注意力。但是，我们一定要从这个危险地方的问题来谈起。
    乌布利希接着谈到签订对德和约以后的问题。他说，裁减军备可以用互相谅解的办法来进行，如果西德裁减军备，那么，战争的危险将减少。
    乌布利希说，社会制度的不同并不妨碍德国统一。我们是为和平而工作，但阿登纳却不谈和平问题，相反地，却掀起反共高潮。乌布利希又说，苏联提出的对德和约草案和德意志民主共和国的建议都提出要在德国消除军国主义，这是所有爱好和平的人们的愿望。
    乌布利希还强调说，假如西德退出北大西洋公约组织，德意志民主共和国就将退出华沙条约。
