Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 18th: The Hungarian National Assembly convened this morning.

    At the morning session, Prime Minister Münnich of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government delivered the government work report.

    In his report, Münnich pointed out that the basic tasks of the 1958 national economic development plan have been completed or overfulfilled. The restructuring of the industrial production structure has been carried out rapidly and has yielded good results. In agriculture, due to the influence of climatic conditions, the production plan for crops was only 98% completed, but the production plan for animal husbandry was greatly overfulfilled. In the past year, the people's living standards have improved, and residents' savings have increased by 1 billion forints, and the current deposits are twice as high as the highest deposit amount before the 1956 counter-revolutionary incident.

    Münnich emphasized that the victory won by the Patriotic People's Front in the general election in November 1958 proved the political unity of the people of the whole country, proving that workers, peasants, and intellectuals supported the policies of the Party and the government, and they are willing to take the socialist road.

    When talking about the tasks of Hungary's national economic construction this year, Münnich said that the basic national investment in 1959 is 13.2 billion forints (excluding the strength of enterprises and short-term bank loans, as well as long-term loans to production cooperatives). This investment amount is 2.2 billion forints more than the expanded investment target in 1958, which is about one-fifth higher. This year, the machinery industry (especially agricultural machinery manufacturing), the electric power industry, the telecommunications equipment industry, and the chemical industry will continue to be developed. In addition, housing construction will also be vigorously carried out.

    Münnich's report pointed out that developing agricultural cooperation is one of the most important tasks of the Party and the government. He said that agricultural cooperation has developed very rapidly since this year. At present, in several states, the conditions for large-scale collectivization have matured.

    When talking about the government's foreign policy, Münnich said that the advantage of the forces of peace and socialism over the forces of war and capitalism will continue to develop in the future. The struggle around the three focuses of the international situation convincingly proves this point. He said that in the Far East, the People's Republic of China has been established for less than ten years, but it has become an invincible force. The People's Republic of China has enough power to restrain the aggressors. In the Middle East, the main Arab countries have carried out a vigorous struggle against imperialism. Although imperialism has tried its best to create contradictions among Arab countries, we believe that the leaders of Arab countries will see through these conspiracies. In Europe, the focus of tension is Germany. We can see that the rigid position of the West is also changing under the pressure of public opinion. Due to the Soviet proposal, the possibility of concluding a German peace treaty already exists.

    Münnich emphasized that the foundation of Hungarian foreign policy remains to maintain a solid friendship and the closest brotherly cooperation with the countries of the socialist camp, especially with the standard-bearer of communism, the Soviet Union. He said that establishing friendly relations with former colonial and semi-colonial countries occupies a very important position in Hungarian foreign policy. Hungary strives for peaceful coexistence with all countries in the world.

    When talking about Hungarian-Yugoslav relations, Münnich said that despite the deep principled differences between the Hungarian and Yugoslav parties, the Hungarian People's Republic holds the purpose of maintaining good-neighborly relations with Yugoslavia. He added: We cannot and will not compromise with the revisionism of the Yugoslav leaders, but at the same time, we strive to establish correct good-neighborly relations between the two countries.

    The meeting continued in the afternoon. The meeting discussed and approved Prime Minister Münnich's report.

    Kish Karoly, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly, made a report at the afternoon meeting on the Soviet government's proposal on the German peace treaty proposed on January 10 this year. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution welcoming the Soviet proposal to conclude a German peace treaty. The resolution stated that the National Assembly instructed the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government to prepare to participate in the peace negotiations proposed by the Soviet Union, and to cooperate closely with the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries, and peace-loving countries, and to do its utmost to conclude a treaty. The National Assembly also called on the parliaments of all countries related to the conclusion of the German peace treaty to support the Soviet Union's significant peace proposal.

    明尼赫总理在国民议会作政府工作报告
    匈牙利人民一心一德建设社会主义
    国民议会通过决议欢迎苏联关于对德和约建议
    新华社布达佩斯18日电　匈牙利国民议会会议在今天上午开幕。
    在上午会议上，工农革命政府总理明尼赫作了政府工作报告。
    明尼赫在报告中指出，1958年发展国民经济计划的基本任务已经完成或超额完成。工业生产结构的改组进行得很快，并收到了良好的效果。在农业方面，由于气候条件的影响，农作物的生产计划只完成了98％，但是畜牧业的生产计划却大大超额完成。1958年农业的总产值还是比1957年增长了5％。在去年一年中，人民的生活水平提高了，居民储蓄的款额增长了十亿福林，目前的存款比1956年反革命事件前最高的存款额还多两倍。
    明尼赫强调指出，1958年11月爱国人民阵线在大选中所获得的胜利，证明了全国人民在政治上的团结一致，证明工人、农民和知识分子拥护党和政府的政策，他们愿意走社会主义的道路。
    在谈到本年度匈牙利国民经济建设的任务时，明尼赫说，1959年国家的基本投资为一百三十二亿福林（不包括企业的力量和短期银行贷款以及给生产合作社的长期贷款）这一投资额比1958年扩大了的投资指标还多二十二亿福林，也就是说，提高了五分之一左右。今年将继续发展机器工业（特别是农业机器制造业）、电力工业、电讯器材工业和化学工业等。此外还将大力进行住宅建设。
    明尼赫的报告指出，发展农业合作化运动是党和政府最重要的任务之一。他说，今年以来农业合作化发展得十分迅速。目前，在若干州，大规模地实现合作化的条件已经成熟了。
    明尼赫在谈到政府的外交政策时说，和平和社会主义的力量超过战争和资本主义的力量的优势在今后还将继续发展。围绕着国际局势的三个焦点而进行的斗争令人信服地证明了这一点。他说，在远东，中华人民共和国成立还不到十年，但是它已经成为不可战胜的力量。中华人民共和国有足够的力量束缚住侵略者的手脚。在中近东，主要的阿拉伯国家同帝国主义进行了有力的斗争，尽管帝国主义极力制造阿拉伯各国间的矛盾，我们相信阿拉伯国家的领导人会识破这些阴谋的。在欧洲，紧张局势的焦点是德国，我们可以看到，在舆论的压力下西方僵硬的立场也在发生变化。由于苏联的建议，缔结对德和约的可能已经存在。
    明尼赫强调说，匈牙利外交政策的基础仍然是同社会主义阵营各国、特别是同共产主义的旗手苏联保持巩固的友谊和最亲密的兄弟合作关系。他说，和过去的殖民地国家和半殖民地国家建立友好关系在匈牙利外交政策中占有很重要的地位。匈牙利争取和世界上所有的国家实行和平共处。
    谈到匈南关系的时候，明尼赫说，尽管匈南两党之间存在着深刻的原则分歧，但是，匈牙利人民共和国抱着同南斯拉夫保持善邻关系的目的。他又说：我们不能够、而且也不会对南斯拉夫领导人的修正主义妥协，但同时，我们力求建立两国之间的正确的善邻关系。
    会议在下午继续举行。会议讨论并通过了明尼赫总理的报告。
    国民议会外交委员会主席基什·卡罗伊在下午会议上就苏联政府今年1月10日提出的对德和约的问题作了报告。会议一致通过了一项欢迎苏联关于缔结对德和约的建议的决议。决议说，国民议会责成工农革命政府准备参加苏联建议的和平谈判，并与苏联、德意志民主共和国和其他社会主义国家以及爱好和平的国家紧密合作，为缔结和约竭尽一切力量。国民议会并且吁请与缔结对德和约有关的一切国家的议会支持苏联这一有重大意义的和平建议。
