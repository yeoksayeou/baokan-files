Welcoming the New Spring
Yang Ling

Today is the Beginning of Spring.

On our land, a new scene of spring warmth, flowers blooming, and overall great leap forward is appearing once again. The heat of the mass movement has long overwhelmed the cold wind of the dying winter; the rising sun of the people's commune adds even more to the splendor of early spring. Living in such spring sunshine, and encountering the day of the Beginning of Spring, how can it not make people doubly cheer and jump!

“The rhythm returns, and the ice and frost diminish as the year ends,
 Spring arrives in the world, and the plants and trees know;
  One feels that life is full before one's eyes,
  The east wind blows, and the water turns green, little by little.”

This is a poem called "An Occasional Composition on the Beginning of Spring" by Zhang Nanxuan of the Song Dynasty. He wrote this poem at the "end of the year," that is, at the end of "the twelfth lunar month." This year's Beginning of Spring also comes early, four days before the Spring Festival. Before our eyes, it is not only "life is full," but full of vigor; what the east wind blows is not only "green, little by little," but a vast expanse of waves.

To imagine that the history of the whole world is a smooth sailing and progresses step by step, and that there are no times when it makes great leaps forward, is undialectical and unscientific. This year's spring, based on the unprecedented victory of 1958, we are in an era of a new "great leap forward."

In terms of natural phenomena, it is not a simple cycle every year—as if the earth revolves around the sun once and returns to the old place. However, astronomers tell us that it is not like this. The sun is "racing against time" to fly forward at high speed; naturally, it also takes the entire solar system, including our earth, to move forward, forward, forever forward.

People often feel that spring plowing, summer weeding, autumn harvesting, and winter storage every year are "the same old routine," and now preparing for spring plowing is "repeating the cycle." In fact, it is not like this. Productivity is always developing continuously. In the past year, while our sun and earth were flying forward in the endless universe, our Chinese farmers and rural workers were also whipping their horses at the forefront of the times. How far have we run this year, and how many new things have we created! When the day of the Beginning of Spring comes again, we are not turning in circles like pushing a millstone, but taking big strides forward on the broad road. When the New Spring arrives, there are countless new things before us.

Last year, when preparing for spring plowing, our planned targets were: the national annual grain production was 392 billion jin, an increase of 5.9% compared with 1957; cotton production was 35 million dan, an increase of 6.7% compared with 1957. The mass movement under the leadership of the Party greatly broke through these targets. As a result of exerting full effort and taking great measures, a miraculous scene appeared in the fields of China. High yields per unit area shone like stars in the sky. Large areas of high yields flowed like the Yangtze River and the Yellow River. Liberated thinking brought great harvests, and great harvests further liberated people's thinking. Wave after wave, surging. The result of "settling accounts after the autumn harvest" was: total grain output – 750 billion jin, more than double the previous year plus 10 billion jin; total cotton output – 67 million dan, more than double the previous year plus 1.4 million dan. … The long river of history is rolling forward continuously. Our Party always walks at the forefront of the times. With the experience of the "great leap forward" in 1958, the Party put forward new and grand goals to the people of the whole country: in 1959, grain output should be increased to about 1,050 billion jin; cotton output should be increased to about 100 million dan. At the same time, many other crops should also make an overall leap forward, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries should undergo a full-scale revolution, and community-run industries should also be developed. This year, when preparing for spring plowing, we are facing such a task: to leap forward on a larger, better, and more comprehensive scale!

Last year, when preparing for spring plowing, our rural areas were still relatively small agricultural production cooperatives. This year, Chinese farmers have become taller, larger, and stronger giants, forming people's communes. At present, the communes are being further consolidated, improved, and upgraded, and county-level federations of communes are being established on a large scale. These giants are beginning to show their strength and will inevitably exert even greater power.

It is still preparing for spring plowing, but how many new favorable conditions are waiting for us to fully utilize, and we need to do more work than in previous years. From ideological preparation to material preparation, we are required to put in greater effort and greater strength.

It is still the Great Leap Forward; however, it is a new Great Leap Forward. In the new practice and new struggle, new experiences and new problems will inevitably arise continuously. How much we need to pay attention to the fresh things that are constantly appearing before us with more keen eyes!

The New Spring has arrived, and new buds are sprouting. Lenin said that communists should be able to hear the sound of grass roots sprouting underground. He also said: "We should carefully study the young shoots of new things, treat them extremely carefully, do our best to help them grow, and 'diligently care' for these weak young shoots." ("The Great Initiative") At least, when new shoots break out of the ground, we should see them. Last year, there were many good experiences. On the roots of these good experiences, some new and more vigorous seedlings are also sprouting, and they should also be valued and cherished. The experience of planting experimental fields has developed into "experimental fields driving basic fields, and basic fields driving large fields" in some areas of Jiangsu Province. The experience of holding on-site meetings has developed into "mobile on-site promotion meetings" in some areas of Shanxi Province. In the work of accumulating fertilizer, quality has become a more important issue. In the work of tool reform, promoting existing inventions and creations has become a more important issue. There are some new problems and new situations that need attention in the depth of deep plowing and the density of close planting. The interrelationships between various measures will also have new experiences and problems in the new situation.

"Spring arrives in the world, and the plants and trees know." Only those who are closely concerned about new buds will be able to feel the breath of spring and the joy of spring more keenly.

    迎新春
    杨岭
    今日立春。
    在我们的国土上，再一次出现了一幅春暖花开，全面跃进的新景象。群众运动的热气早压倒了残冬的冷风；人民公社的朝阳更添加了早春的明媚。生活在这样的春光里，又逢到立春的日子，怎不令人加倍地欢呼跳跃！
    “律回岁晚冰霜少，春到人间草木知；
    便觉眼前生意满，东风吹水绿差差。”
    这是宋人张南轩的诗：“立春偶成”。他写这首诗的时候在
  “岁晚”，也就是说在“腊月”末。今年的立春也来得早，在春节前四天。在我们眼前，不仅是“生意满”，而是生气勃勃；东风吹起的，不仅是“绿差差”，而是波涛万里。
    把全世界历史设想作一帆风顺和按部就班地前进，不会有时候向前作巨大的跳跃，那是不辩证的，不科学的。今年的春天，在1958年空前胜利的基础上，我们正处在一个新的“巨大的跳跃”的时代。
    就自然现象来说也并不是年年作简单的循环——似乎是地球绕着太阳转了一圈又回到了老地方。可是，天文工作者告诉我们，不是这样的。太阳正在“分秒必争”地用高速度飞奔不停；自然，它也就带着整个太阳系，包括我们的地球在内，向前，向前，永远向前。
    人们往往觉得年年春耕、夏耘、秋收、冬藏是“老一套”，现在又来准备春耕是“周而复始”。实际上，也不是这样的。生产力永远在不停地发展。过去的一年，当我们的太阳和地球在无尽的宇宙空间向前飞奔的时候，我们中国农民和农村工作者也在时代的前线快马加鞭。这一年，我们跑了多么远，创造了多少新鲜的事物！立春的日子又来到的时候，我们并不是像推磨一样又转了一圈，而是在康庄大道上又迈开大步进了一程。新春到来的时候，又有不知道多少新鲜的事物摆在我们面前。
    去年准备春耕的时候，我们预定的指标是：全国全年生产粮食三千九百二十亿斤，比1957年增长5.9％；棉花三千五百万担，比1957年增长6.7％。党领导下的群众运动大大突破了这些指标。鼓足干劲大加措施的结果，在中国的田野上出现了新奇的景象。单位面积高额产量像满天星星大放光芒。大片大片的高额产量像大江大河奔流而来。解放了的思想带来了大丰收，大丰收又进一步解放了人们的思想。一浪推一浪，波涛汹涌。“秋后算账”的结果是：粮食总产量——七千五百亿斤，比前年翻一番还加一百亿斤；皮棉总产量——六千七百万担，比前年翻一番还加一百四十万担。……历史的长河在滚滚不断地向前奔流。我们的党永远走在时代的最前线。有了1958年的“巨大的跳跃”的经验，党就向全国人民提出了新的宏伟的目标：1959年，粮食产量要增加到一万零五百亿斤左右；棉花产量要增加到一亿担左右。同时，别的许多作物还要全面跃进，农林牧副渔要全线大革命，社办工业还要发展。今年准备春耕的时候，我们面对着的就是这样的任务：更大更好更全面地跃进！
    去年准备春耕的时候，我们的农村里还是规模比较小的农业生产合作社。今年，中国农民已经成为更高更大更强壮的巨人，组成了人民公社。目前，公社正在进一步整顿、巩固、提高，正在大办县联社。这些巨人正在初试锋芒，必然要发挥更强大的力量。
    仍然是准备春耕，可是，有多少新的有利条件正待我们充分运用，要比往年更多做许多工作。从思想上的准备到物质上的准备，都要求我们拿出更大的干劲，更大的力量。
    仍然是大跃进；可是，又是新的大跃进。在新的实践、新的斗争中，必然会不断地产生新的经验、新的问题。多么需要用更敏锐的眼光注视着我们面前不断出现的新鲜事物啊！
    新春到了，新芽正在萌动。列宁说过，共产主义者要能够听得见草根在地下发芽的声音。他还说：“我们应当仔细地来研究新事物的幼芽，极仔细地对待它们，尽力帮助它们成长，并‘殷勤照顾’这些柔弱的幼芽。”（“伟大的创举”）至少，在新芽钻出地面的时候，我们应该看到它们。去年有许多很好的经验，在这些好经验的根上，也在发出一些新的更茁壮的苗芽，也应该重视、爱护。种试验田的经验，在江苏省一些地方已经发展成为“试验田带动基本田，基本田带动大田”。开现场会议的经验，在山西省一些地方已经发展成为“流动现场促进会”。积肥工作中，质量已成了更加重要的问题。工具改革工作中，推广已有的发明创造已成了更加重要的问题。深耕的深度，密植的密度，都有一些新的问题新的情况需要注意。各项措施之间的相互关系，在新的情况下也会有新的经验和问题。
    “春到人间草木知”。也只有密切关心新芽的人，才会更锐敏地感受到春天的气息和春天的欢乐。
