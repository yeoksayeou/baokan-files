Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, February 25th: Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 2 Medium Plate Mill achieved a double leap in output and quality in February, completing its monthly production plan four days ahead of schedule. The plant's average daily output increased by more than 15% compared to January, and the percentage of first-grade steel plates exceeded the original plan of 92%, reaching 95.1%. Currently, all the plant's employees are building on their success, determined to produce an additional 4,000 tons of high-quality steel plates for the country before the end of the month.

　　At the beginning of this year, the production situation at the No. 2 Medium Plate Mill was not good. By January 18th, it had only completed 52.8% of the monthly plan. Based on this situation, the plant's Party committee immediately mobilized the masses to engage in a large-scale technical revolution and organized employees to carry out competitions. As a result, production in the second half of the month flourished, and the monthly output of high-quality steel plates increased by 2.7% compared to the highest previous monthly output.

　　The plant's Party committee summarized the experiences of the Great Leap Forward last year and in January this year, and made meticulous arrangements for the February production plan at the end of January. Furthermore, in response to the short time in February, the large production tasks, and the coincidence with the Spring Festival, it launched a great airing of views, great debate, and big character posters among employees, focusing on how to ensure the completion of the monthly plan. Through the debate, the employees were even more motivated, and unanimously expressed their determination to achieve a "red" performance every month in this year's Great Leap Forward.

　　After entering February, all the plant's employees immediately launched a vigorous competition centered on ensuring the completion of the daily plan. At the same time, in order to ensure the completion of the plan on a daily basis, the leadership also took corresponding effective measures. For example, many work types such as rolling steel, finishing, heating, fitter work, and crane operation, held three shift-front meetings for work section leaders and team leaders every day to promptly check the completion of the shift plan and arrange the work for the next shift. If it was found that the previous shift had a shortfall in output, measures were immediately taken to make up for it in the next shift. In addition, Party committee secretaries, factory directors, and other leading cadres also frequently worked with workers to specifically study and solve the problems encountered in completing the daily plan.

　　Thanks to the concerted efforts of all the plant's employees, in February, except for five days in the first half of the month when the daily plan was not completed due to equipment maintenance, they exceeded the daily plan every day. (Attached picture)

    天天超额完成日计划
    鞍钢第二中板厂二月份计划提前完成
    新华社鞍山25日电　鞍钢第二中板厂2月份产量、质量双跃进，提前四天完成了月度生产计划，全厂的平均日产量比1月份提高15％以上，钢板一级品超过了原定92％的计划，达到了95.1％。现在全厂职工正在乘胜追击，决心在月底以前，再给国家增产优质钢板四千吨。　　今年年初，第二中板厂生产情况不好，到1月18日仅完成全月计划52.8％。厂党委根据上述情况，立即发动群众大搞技术革命，并且组织职工开展了竞赛，结果下半月生产蒸蒸日上，全月的优质钢板产量比过去最高的月产量提高2.7％。　　这个厂的党委总结了去年和今年1月份大跃进的经验，在1月底就把2月份的生产计划作了周密的安排；并且，针对2月份时间短、生产任务大、又逢春节的情况，发动职工围绕着如何保证完成月度计划，进行了大鸣大放大辩论。通过辩论，职工们更加鼓足了干劲，一致表示要在今年的大跃进中做到月月红。
    进入2月份以后，全厂职工以保证完成日计划为中心，立即展开了热火朝天的竞赛。同时，为了保证按日完成计划，在领导方面也采取了相应的有效措施。例如，轧钢、精整、加热、钳工、吊车等许多工种，每天都召开三次工长小组长班前会议，及时检查班计划完成情况，布置下一班的工作；如果发现上一班产量有亏欠，立即采取措施在下一班补上。此外，党委书记、厂长等领导干部，也经常同工人一起具体研究解决完成日计划中遇到的问题。
    由于全厂职工的一致努力，在2月份，除了上半月因为检修设备有五天没有完成日计划之外，他们都按日超额完成了日计划。（附图片）
