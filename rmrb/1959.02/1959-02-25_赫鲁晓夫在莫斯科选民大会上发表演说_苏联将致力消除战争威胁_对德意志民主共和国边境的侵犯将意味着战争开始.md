Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 24th: TASS reports: Khrushchev, First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, attended the electoral meeting of the Kalinin district of Moscow held in the Great Kremlin Palace on the 24th and delivered a speech at the meeting. He is the candidate for representative in this electoral district for the election to the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation to be held on March 1st.

In his speech, Khrushchev thanked those who trusted him and elected him as a candidate for representative to the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation. He said that he cherished this trust very much and that he would ensure that he would live up to this trust with all his activities.

Speaking of the Soviet Union's domestic policy, Khrushchev said that now, there is no greater task for the Soviet people than to realize the magnificent program of communist construction formulated by the 21st Congress of the Party.

Khrushchev pointed out that the resolutions of the Congress have aroused a great surge of labor enthusiasm in the country. He emphasized that the entire Soviet people regarded the Seven-Year Plan as the cause of their motherland and as a combat program of action.

Khrushchev then spoke of the role of the local Soviets of Working People's Deputies, and he emphasized that the role of local Soviets in managing the country is now growing.

Khrushchev pointed out that the policy put forward by the 21st Congress of the CPSU on transferring the powers of many state organs to social organizations, especially to mass organizations such as the Soviets of Working People's Deputies, was put forward by life itself. He said that this year there will be more than 1.8 million representatives in the local Soviets, which will be a great force of the people.

Khrushchev continued, in our country, the people are the masters. In this regard, he exposed the myth that so-called "people's capitalism" exists in the United States, Britain, France, and other capitalist countries. Khrushchev said that no matter what beautiful clothes are put on the capitalist system, it remains a system in which there is poverty and mass unemployment of the working people everywhere.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union's domestic and international environment is now better than ever. He said that we will fight to eliminate the threat of war in the international atmosphere and strive to realize the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

Referring to the replies of the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany to the Soviet government's proposal in January to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, Khrushchev pointed out that these countries want to impose their will on the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev said that we will not only not take any measures to hinder the development of the German Democratic Republic, but will also promote its socialist construction now and in the future.

Khrushchev emphasized that an infringement on the border of the German Democratic Republic will be regarded by the Soviet Union as an infringement on the sovereignty of this republic and the beginning of war.

Khrushchev believed that the Western countries' proposal on the Berlin issue—namely, the proposal to convene a meeting of the four foreign ministers—was unacceptable because this meeting excluded other countries that had armed forces participating in the war against Germany.

Khrushchev then pointed out that the realistic step that could ease the tense situation was not a meeting of foreign ministers, but a meeting of heads of government with full powers. Khrushchev said that the issue of preparing a peace treaty with Germany could be one of the issues at such a meeting. Khrushchev said that the idea of convening a meeting of foreign ministers might have been correct fourteen years ago, but now this idea is obviously outdated.

Referring to the Soviet government's proposal to give West Berlin the status of a free city, Khrushchev pointed out that it was incorrect for the West to say that the Soviet Union's proposals on a peace treaty with Germany and the Berlin issue had sharpened the international situation.

Khrushchev spoke in detail about the issue of stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and he pointed out that this issue had been discussed in Geneva for nearly four months.

Khrushchev condemned the position taken by Western countries on the issue of supervision, and emphasized that the Soviet Union cannot accept the West's proposals because the purpose of these proposals is to put the entire territory of the Soviet Union under the supervision of foreigners. He said that this is the most real military reconnaissance of our country.

When Khrushchev spoke about British Prime Minister Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Lloyd's visit to the Soviet Union, he expressed the hope that the visit would help improve relations between the two countries.

Khrushchev said that if Macmillan's visit helps to resolve our differences, thereby promoting the easing of world tensions, then we will be truly happy.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet government is willing to sign a treaty of friendship and non-aggression with Britain.

He said that such a treaty could be for a period of twenty years, and if our British guests are willing, we can agree to a period of fifty years or more.

Khrushchev pointed out that while we are becoming friends of the British, we also hope to become friends of their friends.

Khrushchev believed that Soviet-Iranian relations are not very good. He said, however, that these relations should not be further deteriorated.

Khrushchev criticized the draft Iranian-American treaty, which is not in the interests of the Iranian people.

When talking about the relations between the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic, Khrushchev emphasized that the desire of some people to undermine the friendly relations between the two countries has failed. Khrushchev expressed satisfaction with the speech of the UAR President Nasser. He said that we will continue to strengthen the friendly relations between our two countries and support those who are striving to develop the national strength of their own people and to develop their own countries.

Khrushchev continued that the Soviet Union has formed very good relations with the Republic of Iraq, and we will develop this relationship. Khrushchev said that we will do everything possible to help the Republic of Iraq, because this does not harm anyone's interests, but will only contribute to world peace.

Khrushchev emphasized that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people have only one goal—to build communism. The Soviet people love their party. The party has won this love because of its loyalty to the people.

Khrushchev expressed his belief that this election will once again show that the Soviet people are united around their Communist Party.

Khrushchev's speech was warmly welcomed by the participants.

Before Khrushchev delivered his speech, representatives of the voters in this electoral district spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, they said that Khrushchev was a faithful son of the Party and the people, and a man of inexhaustible energy. They also pointed out his initiative in formulating some of the most important measures to consolidate the Soviet socialist state.

All speakers called on voters to vote for the candidate Khrushchev.

    赫鲁晓夫在莫斯科选民大会上发表演说
    苏联将致力消除战争威胁
    对德意志民主共和国边境的侵犯将意味着战争开始
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫24日出席了在大克里姆林宫举行的莫斯科加里宁选区的选民大会，并且在会上发表了演说。他是这个选区的将在3月1日举行的俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃选举的代表候选人。
    赫鲁晓夫在演说中感谢对他的信任，把他选为俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃代表的候选人，他说，他十分珍视这一信任，他将以自己的全部活动保证不辜负这一信任。
    谈到苏联的国内政策时，赫鲁晓夫说，现在，苏联人民再没有比实现党的第二十一次代表大会所制定的共产主义建设的宏伟纲领更为巨大的任务了。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，代表大会的决议在国内激起了劳动积极性的巨大高涨。他强调说，全体苏联人民把七年计划看作是自己祖国的事业，看作是行动的战斗纲领。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到了劳动人民代表地方苏维埃的作用，他强调说，现在，地方苏维埃在管理国家方面的作用正在日益增长。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏共第二十一次代表大会所提出的关于把许多国家的职权转交给社会团体，特别是转交给像劳动人民代表苏维埃这样群众性的团体的方针是生活本身所提出的。他说，今年地方苏维埃将有一百八十万名以上的代表，这将是伟大的人民力量。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，在我们国家里，人民是主人。在这方面，他揭穿了关于似乎美国、英国、法国以及其他资本主义国家里存在所谓“人民资本主义”的神话。赫鲁晓夫说，不管给资本主义制度穿上什么样美丽的服装，它仍然是这样的一种制度，在那里到处都是贫困和劳动人民的大批失业。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联的国内外环境现在比任何时候都好。他说，我们将为消除国际气氛中的战争威胁而斗争，将争取实现社会制度不同的国家和平共处的原则。
    谈到美、英、法、西德政府对苏联政府1月间提出的缔结对德和约的建议所作的回答时，赫鲁晓夫指出，这些国家想把自己的意志强加于苏联。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们不仅不会采取任何妨碍德意志民主共和国发展的措施，而且现在和今后都要促进它的社会主义建设。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，对德意志民主共和国边境的侵犯，将被苏联看作是对这个共和国主权的侵犯和战争的开始。
    赫鲁晓夫认为，西方国家关于柏林问题的建议——即召开四国外长会议的建议是不能接受的。因为这个会议排斥其他有武装部队参加过对德战争的国家。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，能够缓和紧张局势的现实步骤不是外长会议，而是拥有全权的政府首脑会议。赫鲁晓夫说，准备对德和约的问题可能是这种会议上的问题之一。赫鲁晓夫说，召开外长会议的主张在十四年以前可能是正确的，而现在这个主张显然过时了。
    谈到苏联政府提出的关于给西柏林以自由城市的地位的建议时，赫鲁晓夫指出，西方说苏联关于对德和约和柏林问题的建议使得国际局势尖锐化了，这样一种说法是不对的。
    赫鲁晓夫详细地谈到了停止试验原子武器和氢武器的问题，他指出，这个问题在日内瓦讨论已经将近四个月了。
    赫鲁晓夫谴责了西方国家在监督问题上所采取的立场，并强调说，苏联不能够接受西方的建议，因为这些建议的目的在于使苏联的全部领土都处于外国人的监督之下。他说，这是对我国最真实的军事侦察。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到英国首相麦克米伦和外交大臣劳埃德访问苏联这件事的时候表示，希望这次访问能够有助于改善两国之间的关系。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果麦克米伦的访问有助于解决我们的分歧，从而促进世界紧张局势的缓和，那么，我们就会感到真正的高兴。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府愿意同英国签订友好和互不侵犯条约。
    他说，这样的条约可以为期二十年，如果我们的英国客人愿意的话，我们可以同意为期五十年或者更多的年限。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，我们在成为英国人的朋友的同时，也还希望从而成为他们的朋友的朋友。
    赫鲁晓夫认为苏联—伊朗关系很不好。他说，但是，不应当再使这种关系进一步恶化。
    赫鲁晓夫对于不符合伊朗人民利益的伊朗—美国条约草案提出了指责。
    在谈到苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国之间的关系时，赫鲁晓夫强调指出，某些人士想破坏这两国的友好关系的愿望是落空了。赫鲁晓夫对阿联总统纳赛尔的演说表示满意。他说，我们将继续加强我们两国的友好关系、将支持那些为发展本国人民的民族力量、为发展自己的国家而奋斗的人。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，苏联同伊拉克共和国形成了很良好的关系，我们将发展这种关系。赫鲁晓夫说，我们将尽一切可能帮助伊拉克共和国，因为这不损害任何人的利益，而只会有助于世界和平。
    赫鲁晓夫着重说，苏联共产党和苏联人民只有一个目标——建成共产主义。苏联人民爱戴自己的党。党是由于忠于人民而博得了这种爱戴的。
    赫鲁晓夫表示相信，这次选举将再一次表明苏联人民团结在自己共产党的周围。
    赫鲁晓夫的讲话受到了与会者的热烈欢迎。
    在赫鲁晓夫发表演说以前，这个选区的选民代表们在会上讲了话。他们在讲话中说，赫鲁晓夫是党和人民的忠实的儿子，是一个精力无穷的人。他们并且指出了他在制定巩固苏维埃社会主义国家的一些最重要措施方面的首创精神。
    所有讲话的人都号召选民投票选举代表候选人赫鲁晓夫。
