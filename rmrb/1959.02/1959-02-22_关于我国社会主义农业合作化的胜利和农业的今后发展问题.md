Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 5th

Comrades,

Today, we live in an era of unprecedented revolutionary fervor and national prosperity in the history of our country and our people.

Under the leadership of our Party, our people have overcome numerous difficulties in the post-war reconstruction and laid the foundation for an independent economy, ensuring the decisive victory of the socialist revolution in the northern half of the Republic. (Applause)

The socialist construction of Korea has entered a great upsurge. The first five-year plan will be completed two years ahead of schedule.

On this basis, the socialist construction of our country has entered a great upsurge; the entire people, in response to the Party's call, are galloping forward with the spirit of riding a thousand-li horse. Every day, miracles are happening on the entire front of socialist construction, creating a great leap forward.

Due to the heroic labor of our working class, many modernized factories and enterprises have been established one after another, and industrial productivity has been rapidly developing. The total industrial output of our country increased by 44% in 1957 compared to 1956, and by 37% in 1958. Last year, our workers produced industrial products equivalent to 3.5 times that of pre-war 1949.

Along with industry, agriculture, railways, transportation, and basic construction, as well as all sectors of the people's economy, have achieved tremendous successes.

Last September, our Party, based on the achievements in socialist construction and the high revolutionary enthusiasm of our people, proposed a grand prospect of transforming our country into an advanced socialist industrial nation. This prospect stipulates: in the next six to seven years, the production of important industrial products will increase as follows: electricity by 2.6 times, coal by 3.6 times, pig iron and steel by 8 to 9 times, cement by 4 times, chemical fertilizers by 3.3 to 4.3 times, and textiles by 4.6 times. Agricultural grain production will approximately double.

This means that the per capita production of our country will reach 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity, 2,500 kilograms of coal, 400 kilograms of pig iron and steel, 300 to 350 kilograms of steel, 500 kilograms of cement, 150 to 200 kilograms of chemical fertilizers, 50 meters of textiles, and over 700 kilograms of grain.

The completion of these tasks will allow us to build the socialist society that our people have long desired and ascend to the peak of human ideals—the communist society, which is visible on the horizon. (Applause) At the same time, it will lay a solid material foundation for promoting the peaceful unification of our country, ensuring the prosperity of our motherland, and the future prosperity of our nation.

The grand prospect proposed by our Party has received the enthusiastic support of our people and has inspired them with new and even higher revolutionary enthusiasm.

Today, our people, to further promote the socialist construction of the Republic's northern half, have unanimously decided to complete the current first five-year plan two years ahead of schedule. For the prospect tasks proposed by the Party, instead of six to seven years, they will be completed in four to five years, and they are displaying boundless labor enthusiasm, endless creativity, and talent. (Applause)

Agriculture plays an extremely important role in the realization of the grand socialist construction program. Without developing agricultural productivity to a higher level, it is impossible to provide abundant food for the laboring people, nor is it possible to provide sufficient raw materials for the rapidly developing industry.

Under the leadership of our Party, our peasants have achieved tremendous successes in restoring and developing agricultural productivity and have completed the socialist cooperation of agriculture.

Today, our peasants are striving to carry out the technological and cultural revolution in the countryside, transforming our rural areas into a socialist countryside with modern technology, wealth, and culture.

In such an environment, this agricultural cooperative conference is of great historical significance not only in the lives of our peasants but also in the lives of all our people.

At this conference, we will summarize the great victories achieved by our Party and our peasants under its leadership in the socialist transformation of agriculture; we will also summarize the proud achievements we have made in restoring the destroyed rural economy, further developing agricultural productivity, and rapidly improving the lives of impoverished peasants. (Applause) We will comprehensively discuss the new combat tasks facing the agricultural sector and bravely advance to realize them.

Comrades,

The agricultural problem and the peasant problem are one of the most important issues in our revolution. Our Party has always attached great importance to solving this problem.

After liberation, the land problem in the countryside was an urgent revolutionary task that needed to be solved.

The feudal land ownership that had dominated our countryside not only bound hundreds of thousands of peasants to feudal exploitation and a subordinate position, limiting the development of agricultural productivity, but also was a shackle that hindered overall social progress. Therefore, solving the land problem was a fundamental content of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolution.

With the active support and participation of the peasants, the historic land reform implemented by our Party and the people's government shattered this shackle in the countryside, liberated hundreds of thousands of peasants from feudal exploitation, and opened the way for the development of agricultural productivity. Through the implementation of land reform, we confiscated over one million chongbo of land owned by Japanese imperialists and landlords and distributed it free of charge to over seventy thousand landless or land-poor peasant households.

By eliminating the landlord land ownership, the land became the property of the peasants who tilled it, and agriculture developed rapidly, and the lives of the peasants improved significantly.

Land reform strengthened the economic ties between cities and rural areas, between industry and agriculture, and consolidated the alliance between workers and peasants.

Thus, the land reform implemented in our country was a profound revolutionary change with great political and economic significance.

However, land reform did not ultimately solve the peasant problem and did not completely liberate agricultural productivity.

As a result of implementing land reform, individual peasant economies based on small-scale commodity production dominated our countryside. As Lenin said, "Small-scale production is constantly, daily, and hourly, spontaneously producing capitalism and the bourgeoisie." (Lenin: "The 'Left-Wing' Communism: An Infantile Disorder") Of course, in our country, where sovereignty is in the hands of the people with the working class as the core, basic means of production are concentrated in the state, and land reform has been thoroughly implemented, the class differentiation in the countryside is greatly restricted. However, under the conditions of small-scale commodity economy, we cannot fundamentally improve the lives of the peasants, nor can we ultimately eliminate the roots of exploitation and poverty in the countryside.

Small-scale, scattered individual peasant economies not only cannot be developed in a planned manner but also cannot achieve expanded reproduction for the most part.

It is obvious that if small-scale agriculture remains dominant, our agriculture will inevitably encounter certain limitations in its development. On the contrary, our state-owned socialist industry, according to the state plan, has been rapidly restored and developed, achieving continuous expanded reproduction. Our people's government cannot remain on two different economic bases for a long time, that is, the largest-scale, most concentrated socialist industry and the most fragmented, scattered individual peasant economy.

This contradiction was then before us and was a problem that had to be solved sooner or later. As Marxism-Leninism points out, as the experience of the Soviet Union proves, only by guiding individual peasant economies to the path of socialist cooperation can the peasant problem be ultimately solved, and agricultural productivity can be completely liberated from the old production relations.

The situation created in our country after the war gave us the urgent task of solving the agricultural and peasant problems in this way.

Due to the three years of war, our national economy suffered heavy losses, cities and rural areas turned into ruins, and people's lives were very poor, lacking food and clothing.

We had to restore industry and agriculture in a short time, lay the foundation for an independent economy, and improve the poor lives of the people.

At this time, one of the most important issues was the rapid restoration and development of agriculture, especially the solution of the residents' food problem.

Due to the war, the material foundation of agriculture was severely damaged, and labor and animal power in the countryside were extremely scarce, making the peasant economy even more fragmented and weakening the economic foundation of agriculture.

In this situation, the limitations of small-scale commodity production of peasant economies became even more apparent.

If we continued to maintain individual peasant economies, we would not be able to rapidly restore the severely damaged agriculture, nor would we be able to solve the difficult food problem in the post-war period. It is clear that this would have a great impact on the rapid restoration and development of industry and, in turn, on the overall restoration of the people's economy. Thus, the contradiction between socialist industry and individual peasant economy in our post-war situation could easily lead to a deep imbalance between rapidly restored and developed industry and slowly restored agriculture.

At the same time, under the conditions of small-scale peasant economy, which cannot eliminate exploitation and poverty, it is impossible to rapidly improve the poor lives of the peasants, especially to solve the problem of the increased number of poor peasants during the war.

In the post-war period, the only way to solve all the difficulties facing our agriculture was the cooperation of individual peasant economies.

Only the socialist transformation of agriculture can ensure the rapid restoration and further development of the damaged agricultural productivity and ensure the balanced development of industry and agriculture. Only on the basis of socialist cooperative economy can the lives of impoverished peasants be rapidly stabilized, and the lives of peasants can be fundamentally improved.

Based on this situation, our Party proposed the task of agricultural cooperation at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee held after the armistice in August 1953.

Agricultural cooperation is one of the most arduous tasks in the socialist revolution. Lenin once pointed out:

"The transition from individual small-scale peasant economy to collective farming is a great change in the lives of millions of people, involving the deep-rooted habits of life, and can only be achieved through long-term efforts. Only when reality forces people to change their lives, such a change can generally be realized." (Lenin: "The 'Left-Wing' Communism: An Infantile Disorder")

Our country's agricultural cooperation movement began to gradually prepare before the war and was proposed as a current task when the peasants became urgently in need of it in their lives.

In the process of carrying out the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolution, we overthrew the landlords and comprador capitalists and put the basic means of production under state ownership, creating important prerequisites for the socialist transformation of agriculture.

During the implementation of land reform, we confiscated the land and all non-self-cultivated land of the landlords; after the land reform, the buying, selling, mortgaging, and leasing of land were strictly prohibited. The results of this land reform not only eliminated the landlord class but also dealt a heavy blow to the originally weak rich peasants in our country, greatly restricting their development.

On the basis of completing the democratic reform, our people's government began to implement the tasks of the transitional period from capitalism to socialism. The Party and the government, on the one hand, rapidly developed socialist industry and, in the circulation sector, expanded state-owned and cooperative commercial enterprises, thereby continuously strengthening the socialist factors in various sectors of the people's economy. On the other hand, through tax and price policies, they controlled and restricted the development of capitalist factors.

At the same time, the economic ties between cities and rural areas, between socialist industry and individual peasant economy, were rapidly developed, and the development of individual peasant economy was more rationally adjusted.

In addition, our Party had already established state farms, livestock farms, and agricultural machinery stations before the war, demonstrating the superiority of agricultural mechanization and large-scale economy to the peasants and carrying out the preparatory work to guide them to gradually take the socialist path.

Especially during the war, our Party focused its main efforts on rural work, significantly expanding state agriculture, and to overcome the severe shortage of labor, livestock, and farming tools in the countryside, we widely promoted and developed the collective labor organizations with a long tradition in our country, such as mutual assistance. This made our peasants further promote the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation and strengthen their desire to take the path of cooperative economy.

Our Party led the peasants to gradually take the path of cooperation in a very prudent and serious manner.

At the time of the armistice, the most active supporters and acceptors of our Party's agricultural cooperation policy in the countryside were the poor peasants. Due to their extremely poor lives and through the patient education of the Party, they realized that if they did not transform their economy, they could not improve their lives, and only by taking the path of socialist cooperative economy could they bring them happiness.

The Party firmly relied on these poor peasants and the active elements of the Party in the countryside, mobilizing them to organize a few agricultural cooperatives in each county first.

This was the trial stage of our country's agricultural cooperation movement. The purpose of this stage was, on the one hand, to enable the working personnel to accumulate experience in organizing cooperative economy and to gain confidence in the victory of the agricultural cooperation movement; on the other hand, to prove the superiority of cooperative economy to all peasants, especially to the middle peasants, with actual results, so as to attract them to join the cooperation movement in batches. (Applause)

It was a very arduous task to develop and consolidate the agricultural cooperatives composed of the poorest peasants who tilled the most barren land, lacked livestock and farming tools, and had the most difficult lives. However, we were confident that we could do it.

Lenin once taught us that no matter what social system, it can only be produced with the financial support of a certain class, and the institution that needs support above the ordinary level in a socialist state is the cooperative institution. This teaching became our guiding principle.

The Party and the state actively led the management and operation of the cooperatives organized in the early stage and did everything possible to help the cooperatives. For example, they provided loans of grain and seeds, prioritized the supply of fertilizers and farming tools, provided loans in finance, and supported labor, etc. (Applause)

Due to the state's help and the selfless labor of the members, the agricultural cooperatives began to gradually show their superiority.

In 1954, the grain yield per unit area in the cooperative economic sector increased by 10% to 50% compared to individual peasant economy, and the cash income increased by two to seven times. (Applause)

Thus, our poor peasants, under the leadership of the Party and the help of the state, bravely overcame various difficulties and advanced, playing a glorious role as pioneers in the agricultural cooperation movement.

The agricultural cooperatives they organized, compared to the individual peasant economy that dominated the countryside at that time, although they seemed very weak and insignificant, were new sprouts, and they were the great force that ignited the torch of socialist revolution in the entire countryside of our country. (Applause)

These agricultural cooperatives truly demonstrated their superiority. Through the tireless organizational and political work of our Party among the broad masses of peasants, not only the poor peasants but also the middle peasants joined the cooperation movement. Thus, our country's agricultural cooperation movement entered the stage of mass development.

As the peasant masses joined the cooperative economy in batches, the issue of determining the form and scale of the cooperative economy became very important.

Our Party, considering the fact that the land belonged to private ownership of the peasants, the economic situation and awareness of the peasants were different, in the early stage of advocating the cooperation movement, stipulated three forms of cooperative economy and, when organizing cooperatives, guided the peasants to choose the appropriate organizational form according to the specific situation. The first form of cooperative economy was a fixed labor mutual aid team that worked together; the second form was a semi-socialist form that combined land, operated uniformly, and distributed according to labor and land; the third form was a complete socialist form that combined land and basic means of production and distributed according to labor.

When organizing cooperatives, we did not mechanically combine the livestock and farming tools of the members, but according to their wishes, implemented the combination or shared use for a certain period, but still retained them as private property. If they were to be owned by the cooperative, they must be given the appropriate compensation.

The three forms of cooperative economy and the way of combining the means of production made it easier for the middle peasants to accept the cooperative economy. It also prevented various deviations that might occur in the process of cooperation in advance.

Due to the lack of experience in operating the cooperative economy, the low level of management cadres, and the relatively low technical level of agricultural production in our country, we stipulated that the scale of agricultural cooperatives should be relatively small, that is, about forty to one hundred households. The scale of agricultural cooperatives was completely suitable for the situation at that time.

Our country's agricultural cooperation movement was a combination of the quantitative growth and qualitative consolidation of the cooperative economy. As the enthusiasm of the peasants increased, the Party actively promoted the cooperation movement; at the same time, to consolidate the existing agricultural cooperatives politically and economically, the Party and the state concentrated their main efforts on leadership work. Especially from the beginning of 1955, we mobilized thousands of central and local cadres to conduct concentrated leadership once or twice a year. This played an important role in the development of our country's agricultural cooperation movement.

Through this leadership work, we correctly selected and allocated cadres, established a socialist order and system in the young cooperatives, strengthened socialist education among the member masses, rapidly developed production, consolidated the economic foundation of the cooperatives, and achieved great success in improving the lives of the members in a short period. (Applause) In consolidating the agricultural cooperatives, the decisive role was played by the support of the state of the working class.

In the post-war years, the state invested a total of 120 billion won in the agricultural sector to build water conservancy and irrigation projects, expand the network of agricultural machinery stations, and cultivate agricultural technical personnel.

In the post-war period, our Party adopted the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, especially concentrating efforts on the heavy industry sectors that were urgently needed for the development of agriculture and light industry. Thus, the state supplied a large number of chemical fertilizers, agricultural machinery, building materials, and various consumer goods to the countryside.

At the same time, in the post-war period, the state provided over 300,000 tons of grain and seeds, over 243 billion won in agricultural loans, and exempted over 160,000 tons of in-kind tax grain, loan grain, and over 14 billion won in loans to the economically weak agricultural cooperatives and poor peasants.

From 1956, to reduce the burden on the peasants and improve their production enthusiasm, the fixed in-kind tax system was fully implemented, significantly reducing the tax rate, and at the same time, reducing the in-kind tax amount of agricultural cooperatives by 5%.

To solve the problem of the extremely scarce labor force in the countryside, in the post-war period, our Party allocated tens of thousands of demobilized soldiers and many junior and senior high school graduates to the countryside. During the agricultural busy season every year, we mobilized many employees, students, and soldiers to provide hundreds of thousands of labor power assistance.

Although the situation in our country was so difficult after the war, and since the cooperative economy in our country was a newly established system, it lacked experience, but due to the correct leadership of our Party and the great help of the state, as well as the selfless labor of our peasants inspired by it, our country was able to consolidate the rapidly growing agricultural cooperatives in a short period in terms of politics and economy and ensure the continuous development of agricultural productivity and the rapid improvement of the lives of the peasants. (Applause)

As the agricultural cooperatives became more consolidated, their superiority became more apparent, and the agricultural cooperation movement further promoted its development.

Based on the experience and achievements of agricultural cooperation, the Third Plenary Session of the Party proposed the historic task of completing agricultural cooperation during the first five-year plan.

To realize the task of completing agricultural cooperation proposed by the Third Plenary Session of the Party in the shortest time, our Party consolidated the achievements made, and at the same time, concentrated efforts to lead the areas where the cooperation movement was less developed.

In this period, the strata that had not yet joined the agricultural cooperatives were mainly the rich peasants, the farmers living in the suburbs of cities who engaged in agriculture and trade, the farmers living in scattered mountainous areas, and the farmers in the newly liberated areas.

When absorbing all these peasants into the agricultural cooperatives, the Party continued to adhere to the principle of voluntarism and insisted on the policy of consolidating the already organized cooperatives and making the peasants who had not joined the cooperatives recognize the superiority and benefits of the cooperative economy and voluntarily join the agricultural cooperatives.

Thus, by the end of August 1958, our country's agricultural cooperation movement was successfully completed. (Prolonged applause)

This was a great revolution in our countryside and a brilliant victory of our Party's agricultural policy.

Our countryside has completely eliminated the roots of exploitation and poverty that have existed for thousands of years and has been transformed into a socialist countryside where laboring peasants work together and live freely and happily. Hundreds of thousands of peasants in our country have transformed from small producers bound to a small piece of land into the masters of organized, large-scale cooperative economy, becoming glorious socialist laborers. (Applause)

Agricultural productivity has been completely liberated from the old production relations and has entered a broad path of development.

Due to the victory of the agricultural cooperation movement, the worker-peasant alliance has been further consolidated on the new socialist basis.

The working class of our country, which has seized power, has shown strong will and high revolutionary spirit, ensuring the state's support and steadfast leadership for the peasants, proving the correctness of their great cause to hundreds of thousands of peasants, and tightly uniting them around themselves. (Applause)

Agricultural cooperation has also promoted the socialist transformation of urban private industry and commerce. The strength of private industry and commerce in our country was originally relatively weak, mainly based on the small-scale commodity production in the countryside. Due to the cooperation of individual peasant economies, the last stronghold of capitalist factors in the cities was destroyed. Therefore, in our country, agricultural cooperation and the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce were carried out simultaneously and almost completed at the same time.

In less than four to five years after the armistice, our country correctly and relatively smoothly ensured this great and arduous transformation. (Applause)

Relying on the poor peasants to strengthen the alliance with the middle peasants and restrict and transform the rich peasants

This is the basic class policy adopted by our Party in the countryside.

Comrades,

How did we complete such a heavy task of fundamentally changing the lives of hundreds of thousands of peasants in such a short period?

That is because our Party combined Marxism-Leninism and the rich experience of the Soviet Union with the reality of our country, proposed the correct line for our country's agricultural cooperation movement, overcame various difficulties, and at the same time, unshakably fought for its implementation; at the same time, it is also because our peasants firmly supported the Party's agricultural cooperation policy and actively participated in this movement. (Applause)

Our country's agricultural cooperation movement achieved victory through class struggle.

The overthrown exploiting class did not abandon the delusion of restoring the old system, and since our motherland is still divided into two parts, north and south, we are directly facing the enemy, in this situation, we had to fight against the enemy's sabotage activities in the process of cooperation.

The class enemies desperately tried to sabotage our agricultural cooperatives from within and without, slandering the Party's policy, creating reactionary rumors, defaming the agricultural cooperation movement, invading common property, and committing criminal acts of sabotage. Especially when the agricultural cooperation was about to be completed, and the socialist victory in cities and rural areas was increasingly consolidated, the sabotage, destruction, and assassination activities of the counter-revolutionaries became even more frantic.

Our Party strengthened political and ideological work among the peasant masses, raised their socialist consciousness and revolutionary vigilance, and organized and launched a mass movement to purge the counter-revolutionaries.

Thus, we exposed and smashed all the enemy's plots in the countryside at any time, ensuring the victory of the cooperation movement and firmly defending the fruits of socialist victory.

While strengthening the struggle against counter-revolutionaries, our Party, in the agricultural cooperation movement, adhered to the Marxist-Leninist principles on the peasant problem. The peasant problem is the problem of the allies of the working class, the problem of the attitude of the working class and its party towards the various strata of peasants.

Relying firmly on the poor peasants, strengthening the alliance with the middle peasants, restricting and transforming the rich peasants, this is the basic class policy adopted by our Party in the countryside.

The class relations in our countryside were absolutely favorable for the development of the agricultural cooperation movement. At the beginning of the cooperation movement, the composition of the various strata in our countryside was as follows: poor peasants accounted for about 40%, rich peasants only 0.6%; most of the middle peasants were those who became middle peasants after the land reform. At that time, the poor peasants were eager to join the cooperatives; most of the new middle peasants supported the cooperation from the beginning; the rest of the middle peasants were wavering and hesitant, taking a wait-and-see attitude; the rich peasants were watching coldly or opposing.

Our Party, for the middle peasants who were wavering, tried to absorb them into the cooperatives through patient explanation, persuasion, and practical education; for the rich peasants, we strictly restricted their exploitative behavior, and at the same time, absorbed those who were willing to work honestly into the cooperatives, transforming them into socialist laborers; for the few troublemakers who hindered the cooperation movement, we gave them the appropriate punishment.

As the cooperation movement entered the completion stage, the objects of exploitation in the countryside were eliminated, the cooperative economy was further consolidated, and the rich peasants began to voluntarily join the agricultural cooperatives.

Our Party's class policy ensured the healthy development of the agricultural cooperation movement, strengthened the alliance with the middle peasants, and ensured the socialist transformation of the rich peasants.

In the process of agricultural cooperation, our Party overcame various impetuous emotions and conservative thoughts at any time.

The Party strictly prevented the tendency to violate the principle of voluntarism and use administrative methods to lead the peasants into the cooperative economy and timely corrected the tendency to be impetuous, only caring about the increase in the number of cooperatives, or forcibly organizing high-level forms and large-scale cooperatives.

On the contrary, there were also some people who said that the cooperation movement was "too early" or were surprised and retreated due to the rapid development of our country's agricultural cooperation movement.

When our Party proposed the policy of agricultural cooperation, some people expressed doubts about the Party's agricultural cooperation policy, saying: "The north and south have not yet been unified, how can we carry out cooperation?" or "We don't even have machines, how can we carry out cooperation?"

These people did not understand that the socialist construction of the northern half of the Republic is the decisive guarantee for the peaceful unification of our motherland.

The agricultural cooperation and comprehensive socialist construction of the northern half of the Republic are based on the inevitable requirements of the social and economic development of the northern half. Although the southern half has not yet been liberated, we cannot stagnate in one place and wait, nor can we suppress the development of the northern half of the society.

There is no doubt that if we do not carry out socialist construction in the northern half, then we cannot consolidate our revolutionary base—the northern half—politically and economically, and thus we cannot promote the peaceful unification of our motherland.

Our country's agricultural cooperation was carried out in an environment where almost no agricultural technical transformation had been carried out.

Lenin once pointed out that the cooperative economy that simply combines the land and farming tools of the peasants can also improve the economy to a level that individual small-scale peasant economy cannot reach. If such a scattered individual peasant economy transitions to a cooperative economy, the labor productivity can be increased to two to three times, and human labor can be saved to two to three times.

Our experience fully proves the correctness of Lenin's teaching. Although our country's agricultural cooperatives were established on a manual labor technology base, they still fully demonstrated their superiority over individual peasant economy and created conditions for the widespread adoption of modern science and technology in agriculture.

Some people, seeing our country's agricultural cooperation movement developing at such an unprecedented speed and from the beginning, the third form was absolutely dominant, felt some fear and hesitation. However, our country had implemented the most thorough land reform, and the forces opposing the cooperation movement in the countryside were extremely weak; on the contrary, the peasants, through long-term revolutionary struggles, especially through the trials of the war, had raised their political awareness and been tempered; at the same time, because their entire economy was relatively fragmented; under these conditions, the development of the cooperation movement was completely in accordance with the law.

While overcoming all these deviations, our Party firmly relied on the Party organizations and revolutionary forces in the countryside, mobilized the peasants to raise high enthusiasm, and boldly and actively promoted the agricultural cooperation movement.

The cooperation movement promoted the comprehensive leap-forward development of agriculture

The living standards of Korean peasants have generally improved to the level of middle peasants and above

Comrades,

The great achievements of our country's agricultural cooperation and the invincible vitality of our Party's agricultural policy based on Marxist-Leninist principles are clearly reflected in the leap-forward development of agriculture in the post-war period.

In the post-war period, the most important task facing the agricultural sector was to rapidly increase the production of grain and solve the food problem of the residents.

To ensure the increase in grain production, our Party took important technical and economic measures: vigorously built water conservancy and irrigation projects, rapidly increased the supply of chemical fertilizers, various agricultural machinery, and farming tools to the countryside, and widely adopted various advanced farming techniques.

The construction of water conservancy and irrigation projects is of decisive significance in increasing the yield per unit area and increasing grain production.

In the five years after the war, the state's investment in water conservancy and irrigation projects accounted for 57% of the total investment in the entire agricultural sector. In addition to using state funds to build large-scale water conservancy and irrigation projects, each agricultural cooperative also built many medium and small-scale water conservancy and irrigation projects with its own efforts. Thus, in the five years after the war, the irrigated area of paddy fields in our country expanded from 227,000 chongbo to 463,000 chongbo. This means that 91% of the total paddy field area has become a water-safe field.

While expanding the irrigated area, we also widely carried out the construction of river embankments and water and soil conservation, and widely carried out afforestation work, protecting 350,000 chongbo of cultivated land from the damage of floods and tides.

In 1958, the supply of chemical fertilizers to the countryside increased to 12 times that of 1953, and the supply of agricultural machinery and farming tools also increased rapidly.

At the same time, we expanded the network of agricultural machinery stations, and the number of tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower) increased to four times, and the plowed area expanded to 12 times.

Under the conditions of collective economy, we widely promoted the new and advanced farming methods that were impossible to adopt in the individual peasant economy. According to the principle of local conditions, we further improved the distribution of crops.

By 1958, in rice production, the area of cold bed seedlings, which can significantly increase the yield compared to water seedlings, accounted for 50% of the total paddy field area; in cotton production, the area of seedling cultivation using nutrient pots accounted for 70% of the total cotton field area; the area of high-yield corn increased from 236,000 chongbo in 1954 to 826,000 chongbo; in the same period, the land utilization rate increased from 125% to 161%.

Due to the superiority of the collective economy, plus all these technical measures and the selfless labor of our peasants, the grain production of our country has been continuously and rapidly increasing.

In 1956, the grain production had already exceeded the pre-war level, reaching 2.87 million tons, 3.2 million tons in 1957, and 3.7 million tons in 1958. (Prolonged applause) The total grain production in 1958 was approximately twice that of 1946 after liberation. This is a harvest that our ancestors could not even imagine in thousands of years. It must be pointed out that this increase in grain production was achieved under the extremely unfavorable climate conditions of consecutive severe droughts.

Many advanced agricultural cooperatives created even more amazing high-yield records. The Duryang Agricultural Cooperative in Gangnam County, South Pyongan Province, last year harvested an average of 13 tons of rice per chongbo in 160 chongbo of paddy fields, and in a 1.5 chongbo experimental field, achieved a yield of 55 tons per chongbo.

The Samryong Agricultural Cooperative in Suncheon County harvested an average of 3.6 tons of corn per chongbo in 422 chongbo of corn fields, with an average yield of 18 tons in 12 chongbo; the highest yield of wheat per chongbo in the Wonji Agricultural Cooperative in Wonsan County, South Hwanghae Province, reached 4.5 tons.

There is no doubt that if we had not carried out agricultural cooperation, we would not have been able to successfully implement various technical measures for the development of agriculture, nor would we have been able to arouse the high enthusiasm of the peasants for production, and thus we would not have been able to achieve such a grain harvest as we have today in the history of our country. (Prolonged applause)

We have completely solved the problem of food shortages.

Along with the increase in grain production, the production of economic crops, livestock, silkworm, and fruit farming, as well as other sectors of agriculture, has also developed rapidly. Our collective economy not only demonstrated its superiority in ensuring the increase in grain production but also played a decisive role in the multi-faceted development of agriculture.

In 1958, the yield per chongbo of cotton increased to twice that of 1953, and the total production increased to three times. The Samjigang Agricultural Cooperative in Jajin County, South Hwanghae Province, in 61 chongbo of cotton fields, harvested an average of 3 tons of cotton per chongbo, and in a 5 chongbo cotton field, achieved a high yield of 6.7 tons per chongbo. In the production of flax, tobacco, and other economic crops, significant achievements have also been made.

In the livestock sector, by September 1, 1958, the number of cows increased to 1.3 times that at the end of 1953, the number of pigs increased to 2.8 times, and the meat production increased to 3.2 times in the five years after the war.

Due to the launch of a nationwide movement to expand 100,000 chongbo of orchards during the first five-year plan, 53,000 chongbo of land suitable for fruit cultivation have already been reclaimed. In the silkworm sector, the cocoon production in 1958 reached 1.6 times the highest level before the war, which is 8,700 tons.

Thus, the agricultural sector of our country, which has won the victory of socialism, has recently launched a comprehensive upsurge and innovation in all sectors with grain production as the main focus.

The rapid growth of agricultural production has consolidated the economic foundation of the agricultural cooperatives and rapidly improved the lives of the members.

The proportion of public accumulation, by 1956, was about 5% of the net income. But by 1957, when the lives of the members improved, it increased to about 10%, and by 1958, it increased to more than 15%. Last year, the total public property of the agricultural cooperatives in our country was about 68.6 billion won, with an average of 51.5 million won per cooperative and 65,000 won per household.

This is an increase of 2.4 times compared to 1955. Thus, our agricultural cooperatives have laid a solid foundation for continuous expanded reproduction.

Although a large amount of public accumulation funds are accumulated every year, and more seeds, feed funds, and fertilizer exchange grain are deducted every year, as shown in the following table, the income of the members is still increasing.

		Table: Average Income Growth per Cooperative Household
		1955	1956	1957	1958
		Grain (kg)	1,250	1,616	1,742	1,826
		Potatoes (kg)	193	357	434	501
		Cash (won)	5,605	9,542	13,703	20,350

The above table shows that in 1958 compared to 1955, the average income per household increased by 1.5 times for grain, 2.6 times for potatoes, and 3.6 times for cash.

Just after the armistice, about 40% of the total households were poor peasants, and now they no longer exist. The living standards of the peasants in our country have generally improved to the level of middle peasants and above. (Prolonged applause)

Today, our countryside is rapidly transforming from the small thatched houses that have been inhabited for thousands of years into a clean and beautiful socialist cultural countryside. During the post-war period, many beautiful and comfortable cultural houses have been built in the countryside of our country; schools, clubs, nurseries, kindergartens, and clinics have been established everywhere; public baths, barbershops, and laundries have been opened for the members to use in collective cultural life. Due to the full implementation of compulsory education for primary and secondary schools and the further strengthening of adult education, the cultural level of the peasants is rapidly improving, and technical knowledge is more widely spread among the peasants.

The thoughts of the peasants have also undergone a great change. The remnants of feudal and capitalist old thoughts are being eliminated, and their thoughts are being transformed into socialist thoughts.

The peasants of our country, who have found happiness on the path of socialist collective economy, are filled with unwavering determination to defend their precious achievements. They clearly see a brighter future, with a thousand times more courage and confidence, responding to the Party's call, galloping forward on a thousand-li horse. (Applause)

The leap-forward development of productivity, the further consolidation of the collective economy, the rapid improvement of the lives of the peasants, the high revolutionary spirit of the peasants of our country, these are the results of the victory of agricultural cooperation in our countryside, and they are also the results of the victory of our Party's agricultural policy in our countryside. (Prolonged applause)

The peasants of our country should be proud of the great victories of the socialist revolution and the great achievements of socialist construction that they have achieved under the leadership of the Party! (Prolonged applause)

The work of merging agricultural cooperatives has been successfully completed in a short time

The Party has gained valuable experience in achieving and consolidating cooperation

Comrades,

Although our country's agricultural cooperatives were organized under the very difficult conditions after the war, their history is short, and they lack experience, they clearly show their unparalleled superiority.

However, the socialist collective economy will not stagnate but will develop and become even more consolidated.

Agricultural productivity is developing rapidly, and thus the small-scale agricultural cooperatives in our country cannot meet the needs of the further development of productivity. It hinders the rational use of land, the improvement of labor organization, the multi-faceted development of agriculture, especially the realization of agricultural mechanization, and causes unreasonable phenomena in the extensive rural construction.

To successfully carry out the current technological revolution in the countryside and further develop agricultural productivity, it is necessary to merge the agricultural cooperatives and expand their scale. Under the conditions that the agricultural cooperatives have been politically and economically consolidated, the leadership level and business ability of the management cadres have been improved, this is already a mature requirement. At the same time, the peasants of our country also realize the irrationality of small-scale agricultural cooperatives and urgently demand their merger.

Therefore, our Party decided in October last year: to merge the agricultural cooperatives in each "ri" administrative area into one cooperative, with the "ri" People's Committee Chairman serving as the cooperative management committee chairman.

Merging agricultural cooperatives is a complex task, but due to the high political enthusiasm of the peasant masses, it was successfully completed in a short period of one to two months. (Applause) As a result, the original 13,309 agricultural cooperatives were merged into 3,843 cooperatives, with the scale of the cooperatives increasing from an average of 80 households to about 300 households; in terms of cultivated land area, it expanded from 130 chongbo to 500 chongbo.

The merger of agricultural cooperatives allows us to carry out large-scale land improvement work, more widely adopt modern agricultural machinery and advanced agricultural technology, more rationally utilize natural economic conditions, develop the collective economy in all aspects, prevent the waste of labor and materials, and promote the large-scale rural construction in a planned and rapid manner.

At the same time, since the "ri" People's Committee Chairman serves as the management committee chairman, the local government can be closer to production, further strengthening its role and function in the economic and cultural construction of the countryside.

While merging the agricultural cooperatives, we also transferred the rural consumer cooperative stores and credit cooperatives to be directly operated by the agricultural cooperatives. The great significance of this is that the agricultural cooperatives not only strengthen their concern for agricultural production but also for circulation and credit work, thereby further improving the living welfare of the members; at the same time, it is possible to comprehensively plan all economic activities within the cooperative, improving its autonomy and creativity.

This is also an important measure to further strengthen the economic ties between cities and rural areas and more firmly consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

Thus, in the five years after the war, our country has ensured the victory of agricultural cooperation, further consolidated the agricultural cooperatives, and brought them to a new stage of development.

Through these struggles, our Party, the peasants of our country, and all the people have gained valuable experience:

First, our experience clearly shows that the path of agricultural cooperation we have chosen is the most correct path. Because we, according to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, according to the experience of the Soviet Union in socialist construction, guided the individual peasant economy to the path of socialist collective economy, we were able to rapidly restore and develop the rural economy in the difficult post-war environment, improve the lives of the peasants, and lay the foundation for our countryside to gradually become a socialist countryside with modern technology, wealth, and culture.

Second, the experience of our country proves that even under the conditions of no modern machinery and technology, that is, under the conditions where manual labor technology dominates agriculture, agricultural cooperation can be realized; the collective agricultural economy organized on this basis is absolutely superior to individual peasant economy. Because our country implemented agricultural cooperation, agriculture was able to be rapidly restored and developed, and the technical transformation was accelerated.

Third, the victory of our country's agricultural cooperation movement proves that the Party's policy is correct. The prestige of the Party among the masses is very high. At the same time, when the masses, through practical struggle, are convinced of the correctness of the Party's policy and stand together to realize the Party's policy, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome, and any arduous and heavy task can be successfully completed. (Prolonged applause)

The Party's unshakable leadership, the masses' unlimited trust in the Party, and the masses' high revolutionary enthusiasm, these are the decisive guarantees for the victory of the socialist transformation of the rural economy, and they are the decisive guarantees for all our victories.

Comrades,

Our countryside has completely broken away from the past state of poverty, stagnation, and backwardness and has firmly taken the new path of developing socialism. Under the leadership of our Party, our peasants have won victory in the socialist revolution of the countryside and have achieved great successes in socialist construction.

However, we must not be complacent about the victories and achievements we have already achieved. We have no reason to be complacent. We have only laid the foundation for promoting the development of agriculture to a new and higher stage. The main issue is: on this basis, to accelerate the development of agricultural productivity and further improve the lives of the peasants.

Carrying out technological and cultural revolutions is the basic task of the countryside today

Irrigation, mechanization, and electrification are the basic contents of the technological revolution

Today, the basic task of our agricultural sector is: in the next few years, to carry out technological and cultural revolutions in the countryside, so as to further consolidate the socialist collective economy politically and economically, and transform our countryside into a socialist countryside with modern technology, wealth, and culture.

To carry out socialist construction in the countryside, we not only need to transform the production relations but also need to realize the technical transformation of agriculture and transform the thoughts of the peasants.

Technological revolution is the most urgent and important task of our agricultural sector today. If we do not equip agriculture with modern technology, we cannot guarantee the high productivity of the socialist society.

The development of our agriculture mainly depends on technical transformation.

We need to transform agriculture technically to accelerate the development of agricultural production and make labor more efficient.

Our goal is to develop industry more quickly and to lay a modern technological foundation for agriculture, so as to build socialism and then communism.

The technical transformation of agriculture will gradually eliminate the essential differences between industry and agriculture, between cities and rural areas, rapidly improve the technical level of the peasants, and promote the transformation of the thoughts of the peasants.

As our Party has pointed out, irrigation, mechanization, and electrification are the basic contents of the technological revolution in our countryside. We will complete the irrigation of dry fields and paddy fields in two to three years, and the electrification of the countryside in one to two years; we will realize the mechanization of agriculture in four to five years. (Prolonged applause)

Today, our country has the possibility to complete this great task.

Our agriculture has realized cooperation, and the agricultural cooperatives have been merged into larger ones, and their economic foundation has been further consolidated.

Our country has a strong heavy industry base. Due to the correct economic policy of our Party to ensure the priority development of heavy industry, our working class has carried out heroic labor, and thus our industry can produce and supply a large number of iron materials, building materials, tractors, and various advanced agricultural machinery to the countryside.

The main issue is to be able to organize the high enthusiasm of the peasants of our country at present and turn all these possibilities into reality.

In one to two years, the irrigated area will be expanded to one million chongbo

These cultivated land areas can fully solve the grain problem in Korea

The irrigation issue is a basic issue in the technical transformation of our agriculture. In our country, where the cultivated land area is limited, rice production is important, there is a considerable period of drought every year, and floods often occur in the summer, establishing an irrigation system for paddy fields and dry fields, preventing water disasters and droughts, has decisive significance in increasing the yield per unit area and increasing agricultural production.

Due to the consistent implementation of measures to expand the irrigated area by our Party, the irrigation of paddy fields has basically been completed. Today, the central task of irrigation is to rapidly establish an irrigation system for dry fields. We will expand the irrigation of dry fields while continuing to expand the paddy field area. Only in this way can we rapidly increase the grain yield on the dry fields, which account for more than two-thirds of the total cultivated land area, and further promote the development of economic crops, vegetables, and fruit farming. The experience of various advanced agricultural cooperatives and state farms last year proved: under the condition of establishing an irrigation system for dry fields, the yield per chongbo of corn and wheat increased to two to three times that before irrigation, cotton increased to three to four times, and fruits increased to two times. Establishing an irrigation system for dry fields can also significantly improve the land utilization rate and create very favorable conditions for the development of comprehensive mechanization.

The Party Central Committee proposed a combat task at the September Plenary Session in 1958: to establish an irrigation system for 700,000 chongbo of dry fields in the next two to three years, to create 300,000 chongbo of new water-safe fields, and except for the slopes with a large gradient, to establish an irrigation system on 1.4 million chongbo of cultivated land. This is our generation's realization of our ancestors' long-cherished wish—a great plan for the transformation of nature.

Title: The Great Struggle for the Agricultural Revolution in the Countryside

Inspired by the Party's resolutions, the farmers of our country have mobilized in full force to realize this plan. Today, in every village and agricultural cooperative across the country, people are busy cutting through mountains and building dams, transforming rivers and mountains, and constructing numerous irrigation projects.

Currently, including large-scale state-run irrigation projects in areas such as Qixian, Yutian, and the Yalu River basin, more than ten thousand irrigation projects are under construction. It is estimated that this year, the area that can be irrigated will reach 65,000 mu of paddy fields and 230,000 mu of dry fields.

This shows that the great cause of water conservation, proposed by our Party with historical significance, is being effectively carried out.

However, in establishing an irrigation system for dry fields, we have only taken the first step. Ahead of us lies a massive engineering task, and in the future, we will need more labor, materials, and complex technology.

In the tasks outlined in the September Plenum, we must first expand the irrigation area by fifty to sixty thousand mu, so that within one or two years, the total irrigation area can be expanded to one million mu. According to our estimates, with just this amount of cultivated land, we can fully solve our country's grain problem. Within one or two years, we need to expand the irrigation area from the current 460,000 mu to one million mu. This is the first-stage task for us to achieve water conservation.

While carrying out irrigation projects, we must widely promote river management and soil conservation projects, and expand the area of land protection.

Our country has not yet done a good job in river and mountain management, often resulting in the loss of cultivated land due to floods or reduced yields. We must dredge rivers, build dikes, plant protective forests, and widely carry out soil conservation projects to prevent floods. Especially in the eastern coastal areas where floods are frequent, we must focus on river and mountain management while carrying out irrigation projects.

In carrying out irrigation projects, large-scale projects are directly undertaken by the state, while medium and small-scale projects are managed by various agricultural cooperatives.

Water conservation is a great cause of transforming nature, a long-term plan that serves the country and society forever. Therefore, we must launch a nationwide movement to carry it out. Not only farmers but all the people must participate in this cause.

Workers must timely produce and supply cement, steel, wood, various electric motors, and water pumps needed for irrigation projects. Officials, students, and soldiers should directly participate in the construction of irrigation projects. After the war, the officials, students, soldiers, and all the people of our country have participated in the labor of building irrigation projects, providing great help to the country and farmers, and accumulating rich experience. We will continue to mobilize a broad social labor force to support irrigation construction projects in the future.

The urgent problem in irrigation projects is that each construction site must improve its mechanization level. If mechanization is not achieved, it will be impossible to complete this massive project that requires hundreds of millions of laborers. In large-scale state-run irrigation projects in areas such as Qixian and Yutian, we have already used various construction machinery, and most of the work has been mechanized. For this year's large-scale projects, we will also supply a large number of excavators, bulldozers, conveyor belts, and other construction machinery. The state will rapidly increase the production of such construction machinery to promote the mechanization of irrigation construction. However, for more than ten thousand medium and small irrigation projects, it is not possible to fully supply modern construction machinery at once.

Last year, in Pyeongan-namdo, by using simple medium and small machinery such as wooden cranes, carts, and iron ropes in excavation, soil accumulation, and transportation work, not only were four hundred fifty thousand laborers saved compared to the plan, but the earthwork for the project, originally scheduled to start this year, was also completed ahead of schedule by the end of last year. Each irrigation construction site should vigorously implement simple and convenient medium and small mechanization to struggle for saving labor and reducing labor intensity.

To save labor and materials needed for irrigation construction, we must first thoroughly carry out survey and design work. We must correctly select engineering targets based on the principle of rational and comprehensive utilization of water resources, and connect various irrigation facilities into an integrated system to prevent changes in structures or canals during construction or after completion. At the same time, we must further improve the quality of the projects and maximize the use of already completed irrigation facilities.

In the next four to five years, the large-scale production of tractors and trucks will make field operations and transportation operations fully mechanized.

Along with water conservation, mechanization also plays an important role in the technological revolution in the countryside.

After the agricultural cooperativization, various economies have developed, advanced intensive management has been widely adopted, large-scale agricultural construction such as irrigation projects has been carried out, and the rapid increase in transportation work, etc., have caused a shortage of labor in the countryside and a severe lack of agricultural machinery and transportation materials. Therefore, without mechanization, it is impossible to solve the problem of labor in the countryside, nor can it promote the progress of our country's agriculture. The era of replacing the backward manual farming tools that have been passed down for centuries with modern agricultural machinery has arrived.

The mechanization of agricultural economy is an important way to save labor, reduce the burden on farmers, increase production, and reduce the cost of agricultural products.

To achieve the mechanization of agriculture, the most important issue is to supply tractors and trucks, which our country has already started to produce in large quantities, to the countryside. This year, our country will supply five thousand tractors and two thousand five hundred trucks to the countryside.

Our country needs at least thirty to thirty-five thousand tractors and twenty-five to thirty thousand trucks to fully mechanize field operations and transportation operations in the countryside. We must continuously increase the production of tractors and trucks to fully meet the above needs within the next four to five years. In addition, we will produce a large number of other advanced agricultural machinery to supply to the agricultural sector. At that time, threshing, water pumping, and other fixed operations will be fully mechanized, and transportation, plowing, sowing, harvesting, and other mobile operations will also be basically mechanized.

In our country, when realizing mechanization, we must consider the fact that rice production accounts for a large proportion, the land is undulating and sloping, and there are intercropping and ridge sowing, as well as the significant differences in natural economic conditions in various places. Therefore, in realizing mechanization, we should adhere to the following principles: start from flat land and gradually expand to mountainous areas; start from the most labor-intensive and labor-consuming operations and gradually transition to comprehensive mechanization; and make large machinery and small machinery, modern mechanization and simple small mechanization work well together.

So far, our country's agricultural cooperatives have used modern agricultural machinery through state-run agricultural machinery cooperative stations. In the future, for a certain period of time, we will continue to operate and expand state-run agricultural machinery cooperative stations to promote agricultural mechanization. At the same time, as the scale of agricultural cooperatives expands and the economic foundation is rapidly strengthened, we must also equip agricultural cooperatives with modern agricultural machinery, so that agricultural cooperatives can fully transition to having and directly using modern agricultural machinery. This will be more conducive to improving the management and use of agricultural machinery, reducing administrative management costs and non-production labor, and improving the technical level of farmers.

To ensure the smooth implementation of agricultural mechanization, agricultural cooperatives must first level the land, build roads and bridges, and organize mechanized operation teams to make it convenient for tractors and trucks to pass and work; at the same time, we must vigorously carry out the training of tractor drivers, truck drivers, adjusters, and repairmen and other technical personnel.

The agricultural machinery production sector, with the increase in the number of tractors, should produce a large number of various towed machinery and parts suitable for various tractor capacities, and further improve the quality. In particular, we must quickly complete the research on plow machines, which are urgently needed in our country's countryside, and manufacture various agricultural machinery that is both simple and sturdy and can be used for multiple operations as much as possible.

North Korea launches a nationwide movement to build medium and small power stations

The task of electrifying the countryside will be completed within one or two years

To smoothly carry out water conservation and mechanization in the countryside, we must first implement electrification.

Without electrification in the countryside, it is impossible to guarantee the implementation of water conservation and mechanization, nor can we develop rural culture.

Our country has made considerable achievements in rural electrification. Currently, 67% of the entire countryside and 49% of the total number of households in our country are already using electricity.

However, to transform the technology of agriculture, our country still needs a lot of electricity. At the same time, we must install electric lights and wired radio sets in all villages and households. To carry out these tasks, we must rapidly increase electricity production.

Our Party has long clearly proposed the basic direction of electrification in our country. Currently, our country is building large-scale hydropower stations such as Taelu River, Ganggye, and Unpyeong. In the future, we will continue to build large-scale hydropower stations, and at the same time, we will also build thermal power stations in cities.

To complete the electrification of the countryside within one or two years, the most important task is to launch a nationwide movement to build medium and small power stations across the country. Because medium and small power stations can be built simply and quickly without a large investment, and since they can be built in various places, a large amount of wires and other electrical materials can be saved.

In our country, there are water resources and various resources that can be used to build power stations everywhere. The labor enthusiasm and creativity of our country's workers to achieve electrification have reached a high tide, and since last September, medium and small power stations have been widely built in various places. In Hamgyeongnam-do, one hundred sixty-five have been built, in Chagang-do one hundred sixty-three, in Gangwon-do seventy-five, and every village in these provinces has electricity.

In electricity production, we must break away from the mysterious view and actively utilize water power, thermal power, wind power, tidal power, and various other power resources, and more vigorously build medium and small power stations. In the countryside, especially, we must combine the construction of power stations with the construction of agricultural irrigation projects, so that all the water in the reservoirs is first used for power generation and then for irrigation of paddy fields and dry fields, without letting a single drop of water flow away.

Each electrical equipment factory must produce and supply a large number of generators, transformers, and electric motors needed for medium and small power stations.

Water conservation, mechanization, and electrification are inseparable and unified tasks, which are the general line of the technological revolution in the countryside.

In the coming years, we must effectively complete this massive task, irrigate our country's fields with life-giving water, and equip agriculture with modern machinery and technology to ensure a bumper harvest every year, reduce the heavy labor of farmers, and make their labor easier and more enjoyable.

With grain production as the main focus, simultaneously develop various rural economies

Deep plowing, dense planting, and large-scale fertilization are the primary conditions for increasing production

Comrades:

We must actively promote the technological transformation of agriculture and, based on this, ensure the great leap forward in agricultural production.

In the past, our country's agriculture was in a backward state, focusing on grain production, and even problems in grain production could not be solved in a timely manner. In the future, we must thoroughly eliminate the backwardness of our country's agriculture and ensure the diversified development of the agricultural economy.

We must continue to resolutely implement our Party's policy of focusing on grain production while simultaneously developing economic crops, livestock, sericulture, fruit trees, and freshwater aquaculture, thereby transforming our country's countryside not only into a powerful grain base but also into a powerful raw material base.

The grain problem is one of the most important issues in socialist construction. If we do not vigorously develop grain production, we will not be able to supply residents with enough food, nor will we be able to further develop other sectors of the agricultural economy such as livestock.

In our country with limited land area, the key to increasing the production of grain and other crops lies in further developing intensive management and increasing the yield per unit area.

Engels once said:

"Humanity's command over productive forces is boundless. By applying capital, labor, and science, the yield of the land can be increased indefinitely."

Our country has a small area of cultivated land, and the land is very barren. However, as long as we can improve agricultural technology and continuously develop intensive agriculture, barren land can be transformed into fertile land, and a small area of land can also increase production indefinitely.

Intensive agricultural management is the key to ensuring high yield. In this regard, our farmers have accumulated rich experience and achieved high yields that our ancestors could not even imagine.

To further increase the yield per unit area, we must continue to develop intensive agriculture. This is the basic policy of our Party in agricultural production.

Along with water conservation and mechanization, deep plowing, dense planting, and large-scale fertilization are the basic methods of realizing intensive agricultural management and the primary conditions for increasing the yield per unit area.

According to the results of experiments by the agricultural science research department, deep plowing can increase the yield per mu of rice. In paddy fields that are plowed to a depth of fifteen centimeters, the yield increases by 23% compared to paddy fields that are plowed to a depth of ten centimeters, and by 27% in paddy fields that are plowed to a depth of twenty centimeters. Looking at the relationship between rice planting density and yield: planting 240 stalks per square meter increases the yield by 35% compared to planting 120 stalks per square meter, and planting 18 ears of corn per square meter increases the yield by 54% compared to planting 10 ears.

Last year, the experience of various agricultural cooperatives that achieved high yields in experimental fields also clearly proved the superiority of deep plowing and dense planting.

As pointed out in the letter from the Party Central Committee to all Party members, starting from this year, we must plow paddy fields and dry fields to a depth of more than thirty centimeters, and increase the planting density, so that the number of rice plants per square meter reaches more than 300, the number of corn plants reaches more than 15, and the sowing quantity per mu of wheat reaches more than 300 kilograms.

The most important condition for achieving high yield is large-scale fertilization. Deep plowing and dense planting can only be effective under the condition of large-scale fertilization. We must resolutely increase the amount of fertilization and, based on the soil quality and the needs of various crops, establish a scientific fertilization system to ensure the correct proportion of various fertilizers.

Each agricultural cooperative must apply an average of more than 50 tons of organic fertilizer per mu in all cultivated land. To this end, more than 100 million tons of organic fertilizer must be produced nationwide each year. Each agricultural cooperative must make every effort to tap all sources of fertilizer such as manure, compost, and peat, and launch a daily nationwide movement to rapidly increase the production of organic fertilizer.

At the same time, we must also apply more chemical fertilizers. The state will further develop the fertilizer industry and supply more fertilizers to the countryside, so that within four to five years, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu can be increased to 800 to 1,000 kilograms, especially significantly increasing the proportion of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers, which are currently insufficient. Each agricultural cooperative should also establish small fertilizer factories to produce a large number of phosphorus, potassium, and lime fertilizers.

In addition, we must quickly complete the ongoing soil survey of one million mu of cultivated land to establish a scientific fertilization system based on this.

In increasing the yield per unit area, sowing high-quality seeds, improving field management, and preventing and controlling diseases and pests are also important.

Each agricultural cooperative must establish seedling plots and further improve and strengthen seedling work to cultivate high-yielding, high-quality seeds suitable for local climate and soil. We must manage fields like managing gardens and use pesticides and all possible methods to thoroughly prevent and control crop diseases and pests.

We must fully adopt the proven high-yield farming methods such as cold bed seedling raising and cotton nutrition pot transplanting. Each agricultural science research department and agricultural cooperative should further strengthen experimental research work to improve agricultural production methods, especially actively encourage and inspire the enthusiasm and creativity of farmers.

In developing agricultural technology and improving farming methods, launching a struggle against conservative ideas is of decisive significance. If we persist in and adhere to the backward farming methods passed down from the old feudal era, agriculture will not be able to develop. Therefore, we must launch a struggle against all conservative ideas, advocate creativity, and boldly and actively adopt advanced agricultural technology.

In this way, in the field of agricultural science, we must launch a great revolution, and in the yield per unit area, we must continuously create new records.

In the next two to three years, the annual grain production will reach 700 million tons

All the rice needed by the people of North Korea will be fully supplied

All members of the agricultural cooperatives in our country must strive in the next two to three years to make the yield per mu of rice reach 10 to 15 tons, corn reach 4 to 5 tons, and wheat reach 3 to 4 tons. In this way, we will undoubtedly be able to complete the task of producing more than 700 million tons of grain per year.

At that time, our country will fully supply all laborers with rice and will also lay a solid foundation for further developing the livestock industry. This is undoubtedly a huge task, but it is not an ideal for the distant future.

As long as all the farmers in our country follow the Party's agricultural policy and successfully implement the above-mentioned measures to improve agricultural technology and farming methods, this task of struggle will be able to be completed in the next few years.

Along with the increase in grain production, we must further increase the production of economic crops and vegetables.

In the field of economic crops, we should focus on the cultivation of cotton and other fiber crops and various oil crops, and also cultivate more sugar beets, tobacco, ginseng, and hemp.

Today, solving the problem of fiber raw materials is very important for us. In the past, our country's textile industry was extremely backward, and fiber raw materials could not be solved independently. Today, our country's textile industry has reached a considerable level, and the production of chemical fibers has also begun, gradually solving the raw material problem. Our country will further develop the textile industry and increase the production of cloth to 500 million meters within four to five years. To ensure the raw materials needed for the textile industry, we must not only rapidly increase the production of chemical fibers but also rapidly increase the production of natural fibers such as cotton.

Recent experience has proven that our country can produce natural fibers in large quantities.

In the cultivation of cotton, we must increase the yield per mu to more than 3 to 4 tons and expand the cotton sowing area to increase the cotton production to more than 200,000 tons within two to three years. At the same time, we must widely cultivate hemp and flax in the mountainous areas of Chagang-do, Chagang-do, and Hamgyeongbuk-do.

To fully supply the people with edible oil, each agricultural cooperative must vigorously cultivate peanuts, sunflowers, sesame, hemp seeds, and rapeseed, and strive to produce more than 100,000 tons of edible oil in the coming years. In addition, within the next few years, to ensure the production of 100,000 tons of white sugar, we must expand the cultivation area of sugar beets to 30,000 mu and increase its yield per unit area.

The agricultural cooperatives in cities and worker districts should expand the vegetable base and continuously increase the yield per unit area to ensure a normal supply of various fresh vegetables to workers and officials.

Rapidly developing the livestock industry is currently one of the most important tasks facing the agricultural sector.

From ancient times, the Korean people have called those who eat rice, drink meat soup, and live in tiled houses as wealthy households. Now we are struggling to make all laborers live a wealthy life. Soon we will be able to fully supply rice. The main problem now is to produce a large amount of meat to supply to the residents.

Today, the demand for meat and other livestock products from the laboring people is rapidly increasing. We must rapidly develop the livestock industry to meet this demand.

Recently, our Party has discussed the issue of rapidly strengthening the production of livestock products and has proposed a series of specific tasks.

Within the next two to three years, we must produce 400,000 tons of meat, 460,000 tons of milk, 1.5 billion eggs, and more than 700 tons of wool.

To this end, each agricultural cooperative must more rapidly develop the livestock industry, with collective livestock as the main focus, and also develop individual livestock in each household.

Agricultural cooperatives should focus on the breeding of pigs, which have a high reproduction rate and can be raised in pens, and also raise a large number of cattle, chickens, and ducks to increase the meat production per 100 mu to 25 tons.

To increase milk production, we must milk from Korean cattle, and within two to three years, at least 300,000 Korean cattle must be changed to dairy cattle, and the milking amount per cow must be increased to 1.5 to 2 tons.

We must continue to consolidate the foundation of the livestock industry and, within two to three years, vigorously breed livestock, increasing cattle to 1 million, pigs to 4 million, and sheep and goats to 60 to 70 million.

In developing the livestock industry, the most important issue is to establish a solid feed base. Within the next few years, we must change 200,000 mu of post-harvest land of cereals and 100,000 mu of slopes and barren land into feed land, and widely plant various grasses in grazing land, idle land, and foothills. Feed for livestock must be mainly silage and hay. Silage is a feed that all livestock love to eat and gain weight quickly after eating, and it can significantly reduce the cost of livestock products compared to other feeds. Each agricultural cooperative must vigorously produce silage. Using the post-harvest crop of cereals—fresh corn stalks with ears, a large amount of mixed silage feed is made as pig feed.

The achievements in silkworm breeding and the achievements in the breeding of oak silkworms and castor silkworms in recent years have opened up a broad prospect for the development of the sericulture industry.

We not only need cotton textiles but also wool textiles and silk textiles. To increase the production of silk textiles, we must develop the sericulture industry.

Within the next two to three years, we must increase the production of cocoons to 60,000 to 70,000 tons.

Agricultural cooperatives must continue to expand the planting area of mulberry trees, oak silkworm forests, and castor beans, widely adopt collective breeding, multiple breeding, and other advanced breeding methods, and continuously improve the quality and yield per unit area of cocoons.

In various places in our country, a large number of delicious fruits are produced. We must expand the orchard area to 100,000 mu within the next two to three years and to 200,000 mu within ten years. We must plant fruit trees in all hilly areas and villages and also plant fruit trees along the sides of roads. In this way, not only can we increase the production of fruits, but we can also make our country's land more beautiful.

Each agricultural cooperative must widely adopt advanced fruit tree management methods, increase the amount of fertilization, and ensure sufficient irrigation to increase the yield per mu of fruits to more than 20 tons within the next few years.

Each agricultural cooperative must vigorously develop shallow sea aquaculture and freshwater aquaculture. Launching this work can not only create aquatic product resources but also overcome the seasonal limitations of the aquaculture industry, ensure safe and large-scale production, and more perfectly meet the demand for aquatic products.

Our country has favorable conditions for the development of shallow sea aquaculture and freshwater aquaculture. In the eastern and western coasts of our country, there are vast shallow seas and saline-alkali lands, and there are many reservoirs, lakes, and rivers in various places. In 1/3 of the total cultivated land area, which is paddy fields, fish can also be raised. We must make good use of these favorable natural conditions and rapidly develop aquaculture and fish farming to increase the aquatic product production in this sector to 30 to 40 million tons within the next two to three years.

In addition, we will also raise bees, pick wild vegetables, and pick wild fruits, and also carry out food processing production. We will develop all sideline production that can be developed by agricultural cooperatives based on natural economic conditions, and continue to implement our Party's slogan of "eating from the mountains and eating from the sea."

In this way, we must develop agriculture in various ways, rapidly increase the income of agricultural cooperatives, further consolidate their economic foundation, and make the lives of farmers wealthy.

We must not only produce a large amount of grain but also produce a large amount of various agricultural and sideline products, transforming our country's agriculture into a developed socialist economy that can meet the diverse needs of the people's economy and residents.

Vigorously build rural housing and cultural welfare facilities

In the next four to five years, the countryside will become even more beautiful

Each agricultural cooperative, while comprehensively developing various agricultural production, should focus on rural construction.

Our Party regards the construction of a new cultural countryside as an important task. Our country's agricultural cooperatives have vigorously carried out construction work and have achieved great results.

However, we have not yet completely changed the old face of the countryside, which has been formed by thousands of years of oppression, exploitation, and poverty.

The construction of each agricultural cooperative must focus on production construction and vigorously build new cultural housing, and build more educational, cultural, health, and welfare facilities.

We must strive to significantly improve the quality of construction. Every building and facility we build must meet the needs of the socialist happy life of our country's farmers. They should be convenient to use, and at the same time, they should be elegant, beautiful, and sturdy.

The state will continue to supply the necessary materials for rural construction and provide farmers with technical assistance. Each agricultural cooperative should widely mobilize and utilize local materials in rural construction and solve the construction materials as much as possible by themselves. This will reduce construction costs and further accelerate the construction speed.

We must rationally distribute housing and various cultural welfare facilities, build roads, plant trees, and make our countryside even more beautiful.

In this way, we must completely change all the countryside into a socialist countryside within the next four to five years.

The cultural revolution is a realistic requirement for socialist construction in the countryside

In the next few years, make all members have the knowledge equivalent to junior high school graduation

Comrades:

The important task facing our countryside today is the cultural revolution. If we do not carry out the cultural revolution, we will not be able to carry out the technological revolution in the countryside, nor will we be able to consolidate the already victorious socialist production relations. We must actively promote the cultural revolution to meet the realistic requirements of socialist construction in the countryside.

The most important task in the cultural revolution in the countryside at present is to improve the general knowledge and technical level of all farmers.

Our country has implemented the compulsory junior high school education system since last November, and within four to five years, it will implement the universal technical compulsory education system. Therefore, our young generation can all receive secondary education, and in the future, they can also receive comprehensive technical education. The state will further strengthen the work of training agricultural experts and technical personnel in higher technical colleges and universities. Each level of school should closely combine education with production and cultivate a new generation of all-round developed and talented socialist builders.

At the same time, we must strive in the next few years to make all members of agricultural cooperatives have knowledge equivalent to or higher than the graduation level of people's schools or junior high schools, and master a certain level of technology. To this end, our Party advocates that each agricultural cooperative should widely establish worker schools and worker high schools. According to this policy of the Party, worker schools and worker high schools have been widely established in agricultural cooperatives across the country, and many members are studying here. In the future, we must further strengthen and develop this work. At the same time, we must widely absorb members to participate in the correspondence education network and launch a mass movement to study new technologies.

In this way, all farmers will become knowledgeable people, people with technology, and people who are proficient in agricultural production.

To improve knowledge and technical level, we must also make farmers live a cultured life.

Now we live in the most advanced socialist system. Today, our country has transformed from a backward agricultural country into a socialist industrial and agricultural country. Society has developed, and the economy has also developed, so people must live a cultured life.

We must change our lives into a cultured life, regard it as an important task at present, and carry it out as a nationwide movement. We must eliminate all unhealthy and uncultured phenomena, boldly reform backward lifestyles and habits.

To further improve and strengthen rural health and sanitation work, we must completely eradicate blood fluke disease and other waterborne diseases and infectious diseases, and thoroughly eliminate flies, mosquitoes, bedbugs, and rats. Each member of the agricultural cooperative should make their homes and villages more clean and beautiful, raise their children better, and make their lives more comfortable and cultured.

At the same time, we must further improve the work of the democratic propaganda room, making it a place for farmers to study, receive education, and engage in cultural entertainment, and also develop mass work such as sports, literature, and art amateur groups in the countryside.

Vigorously carry out communist ideological education among the peasant masses

Arming the peasants with strong love for the motherland and internationalism

To further consolidate the agricultural cooperatives politically and build socialism, and to prepare for the gradual transition to communism, we must further strengthen the communist ideological education among the peasant masses.

In our countryside, the socialist production relations have already achieved victory. However, our peasants have not yet completely eliminated the feudal and capitalist ideological remnants inherited from the old society.

In the peasant masses, we must vigorously carry out communist ideological education, thoroughly eliminate the various ideological remnants of the peasants, and transform their ideology.

First of all, we must make the peasants continue to realize that the socialist agricultural cooperativization system, which has achieved victory in the countryside, is absolutely superior to the capitalist system or the small commodity economy, and educate the peasants to support this system and resolutely fight against those who attempt to restore the system of exploitation, and firmly defend the victorious achievements of socialism from the enemy's invasion.

In carrying out communist education among the peasants, the most important thing is to eliminate their selfishness and the bad roots of small commodity owners. Selfishness is a huge obstacle to our progress.

To effectively build socialism, we must consolidate and further develop the socialist and collective ownership in the countryside. And to build communism in the future, we must gradually transform collective ownership into public ownership. Without eliminating selfishness, it is impossible to promote all these development processes.

We must educate all members of the agricultural cooperatives to cherish public property, respect the interests of the state and society, and make personal interests subordinate to the interests of the state and society; in collective life, we must cultivate a comradely spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. The public property and collective economy of the cooperative are the foundation for the development of the cooperative and the source of improving the living standards of the members. We must resolutely launch a struggle against embezzlement, waste, and theft of public property, or against the tendency of not seriously participating in collective economic work.

At the same time, we must educate all members of the cooperative to love labor.

Labor is the most noble thing, and all the wealth of human society is created by the labor of laborers.

Today, our farmers are not working for landlords or capitalists, but for their own happiness and the interests of the state and society. Under our system, labor is the most glorious thing, a sacred duty of all people. The principle of socialism is that those who do not work shall not eat. Not loving labor, being lazy, and living off others is the most shameful thing. We must educate the members of the cooperative to establish a correct view of labor, love labor, honestly participate in collective labor, and consciously observe labor discipline.

We must arm the peasants with strong socialist patriotism and proletarian internationalism.

Socialist patriotism should start from loving one's own cooperative and loving one's own hometown. All farmers in our country should become ardent patriots who love their hometown and socialist motherland.

We must further strengthen the proletarian internationalist ideological education among the peasants, so that they, starting from loving their socialist motherland, support the socialist camp, strengthen the friendship and unity with the people of the socialist camp countries and all the laboring people around the world who yearn for socialism.

To ensure the effective implementation of socialist construction, we must further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. It is the basis for the unity of all the people and the decisive factor for revolutionary victory. In our country, the worker-peasant alliance has gone through the trials of war and, through the socialist revolution, has entered a new stage of development.

In carrying out the technological revolution and cultural revolution in the countryside, we must further strengthen the leadership and assistance of the working class to the peasants, further promote the development of agriculture and the ideological transformation of the peasants, and further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and further enhance the leadership role of the working class.

Strengthen the leadership and assistance of the Party and the state to the cooperatives

Promote internal democracy and improve the political and business level of cadres

Comrades:

To effectively carry out the important tasks of the agricultural sector, and to further consolidate the collective economy politically and economically, we must improve the management work of agricultural cooperatives, and further strengthen the leadership and assistance of the Party and the state to the cooperatives.

Since the agricultural cooperativization has been completed, the original agricultural cooperatives have been merged and entered a new stage of development, so this conference will pass a new standard charter for agricultural cooperatives.

The basic content of the draft of the new standard charter for agricultural cooperatives is to make all members of agricultural cooperatives in our country, under the leadership of the working class, further consolidate the victorious achievements of socialism in the countryside, complete the construction of socialism, and prepare for the gradual transition to communism. The new standard charter is the crystallization of the long-term struggle of our farmers for land and freedom; it is a mirror that illuminates their collective life norms; it is a beacon that shows them a brighter future.

We must further improve the management work of agricultural cooperatives, so that the merged agricultural cooperatives, in accordance with the basic principles of the new standard charter for agricultural cooperatives, can better complete the important tasks before them.

Under the conditions of increasing members and expanding the scope of work of the cooperatives, further promoting internal democracy is the key to consolidating the cooperatives. We must widely absorb the masses of members to participate in the management work of the cooperatives, so that they can express their opinions without reservation as the masters of the cooperatives, criticize shortcomings, and unite as one to give full play to greater enthusiasm and creativity in all work. At the same time, we must thoroughly rectify the bureaucratic style that still exists among the management cadres, so that they can establish a revolutionary mass viewpoint: rely on the masses to work, learn from the masses, and educate the masses. We must regularly and periodically convene members' meetings, representatives' meetings, and management committees, and all issues must be decided through collective discussion and decision-making, and the work and financial situation of the cooperative must be reported to the members in a timely manner.

As our experience has proven, the political and business level of the management cadres is of great significance in consolidating the cooperatives. Through the merger work, the team of management cadres has been further strengthened, but compared to the requirements of the huge task, their level is still low.

Management cadres, especially the heads of the management committees, must strive continuously, not only to be proficient in all aspects of agricultural production organization and technology, but also to strive to master the knowledge of commodity circulation, credit, education, culture, health, and other sectors, and understand the internal life of the cooperative. The Party and the government should continue to strengthen the training and re-education of management cadres and continue to help them improve their political and business levels.

Our country's agricultural cooperatives are large-scale socialist economies. It goes without saying that such an economy cannot be operated without a plan. Especially in the new situation that has been created today, the significance of planning is even greater.

Not only in production, but also in distribution, exchange, and consumption, in all economic activities of the cooperative, planning must be implemented, and education, culture, health, and other work must also be developed in a planned manner. Each agricultural cooperative, especially for the scientific-based long-term plan, must also pay deep attention, so as to carry out large-scale natural transformation work and technological transformation of agriculture, and ensure the construction work in the countryside, and develop the collective economy in a planned manner.

Each agricultural cooperative must formulate production and construction plans, ensuring the maximum use of potential and various possibilities, and achieving the greatest results with the least labor, materials, and funds.

Each agricultural cooperative must seriously maintain the balance between accumulation and consumption, ensuring continuous expanded reproduction, and improving the living standards of members in a planned manner. We must oppose the phenomenon of not considering the current living standards of members and emphasizing the construction that can be postponed, and also oppose the phenomenon of not considering the development of the collective economy and the economic foundation of the cooperative, and eating as much as possible without caring about tomorrow.

Our principle is to consider both accumulation and consumption; gradually increase accumulation with the improvement of the living standards of members. Only by increasing accumulation can we continuously improve the material and cultural living standards of members on a solid foundation.

To complete the technological revolution in the countryside, carry out large-scale production construction and cultural construction in the countryside, we must increase the public accumulation fund of agricultural cooperatives.

Each agricultural cooperative must consider its own specific situation and decide the proportion of accumulation for each year within the range specified in the charter.

The public accumulation fund is the basic source of increasing the public property of the cooperative. Each agricultural cooperative uses the public accumulation fund to purchase tractors, cars, and other modern machinery, continuously increase production, expand production and cultural facilities, and build housing.

In the future, the evaluation of the work performance of cooperatives will not only be based on the amount of income of members but also on the amount of public accumulation fund and the scale of basic construction.

We must strictly manage the public property that increases with the increase of the public accumulation fund, so that it can be more rationally used to develop the collective economy and improve the welfare of members.

Improving the organization of labor and rationally utilizing labor is a particularly important issue for today's agricultural cooperatives.

Each agricultural cooperative must adapt to the new specific situation, rationally reorganize the work teams, and further increase the proportion of all members participating in collective labor.

We must thoroughly eliminate the phenomenon of frequently changing workplaces, not timely preparing working conditions, and not timely issuing work instructions, which waste labor.

At the same time, we must vigorously launch a socialist competition movement between teams, between classes, and between cooperatives, widely promote excellent achievements and experiences, and strive to continuously launch new innovations in economic and cultural construction.

Each agricultural cooperative must deeply care about the daily life of members.

We must prevent the phenomenon of waste that may arise with the rapid increase in the income of members, and guide them to properly arrange their own lives. We must also care about the labor protection conditions of members, ensuring that all members have a certain amount of time for rest and sleep. Especially, we must reduce the household burden of women, create conditions for protecting children and better raising children. To this end, we must do a good job in kindergartens, nurseries, laundries, sewing workshops, and also set up public canteens during the busy farming season.

In the situation of completing agricultural cooperativization and expanding the scale of cooperatives, we must strengthen the guidance and assistance of the Party and the state to the cooperatives.

Starting from this year, we plan to reduce the proportion of agricultural in-kind tax from the previous 10% to 27% of the average annual production to 12%. (Applause) and plan to completely exempt the agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas with relatively weak economic foundations from agricultural in-kind tax. (Applause)

In today's situation where the production of agricultural products is rapidly increasing year by year, such a significant reduction in the in-kind tax rate will bring great economic benefits to agricultural cooperatives, promote the significant increase of accumulation, further accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture and rural construction, and greatly help to consolidate the economic foundation of backward cooperatives and further improve the living standards of farmers.

In ensuring the development of agriculture and consolidating the collective economy, we must further enhance the role of Party organizations, government agencies, and agricultural economic leadership cadres at all levels. Recently, our Party has taken a series of measures to strengthen the leadership of the People's Committees of provinces, cities, and counties in rural areas and expand their powers. This has great significance in making the leadership closer to production, adapting to the new rural reality, giving full play to local creativity, and tapping production potential and possibilities.

We must eliminate the formalistic style in rural leadership work, strengthen on-site leadership, and especially concentrate leadership forces on agricultural cooperatives with relatively weak economic foundations, so that these cooperatives can develop rapidly.

All agricultural leadership cadres must combine the leadership with the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, further strengthen the unity of the Party and the masses, and thoroughly implement our Party's agricultural policy.

To ensure the leadership of the Party over rural work, we must especially strengthen the work of the Party organizations of agricultural cooperatives.

The Party organizations of agricultural cooperatives must go deep among the masses, propagate and implement the Party's line and policy, mobilize them to actively implement the Party's policy, and in this process, improve the vanguard role of Party members.

In the situation where several villages and Party organizations are merged into one cooperative, we must overcome the past narrow localism and familyism tendencies, further strengthen the ideological unity and mutual assistance of members.

The Party organization must strengthen the leadership and supervision of the management and operation of agricultural cooperatives and economic activities.

The Party organization must strengthen and assist the work of patriotic martyrs' families and military families within the cooperative, and always care about their lives and the education of their children, and help them in all aspects, so that they can play a core role in the work of the cooperative.

The Party organization must also pay good attention to the work of mass organizations such as the Democratic Youth League.

In our country's socialist construction, the reserve force of the Party—members of the Democratic Youth League, are undertaking the task of the shock troops.

The Party organization must correctly lead the youth organization, strengthen the communist education of the youth, continuously improve their technical and cultural level, and let them serve as brave warriors of the motherland and the people, devoting all their wisdom and revolutionary enthusiasm to the socialist construction in the countryside.

We must develop all agricultural cooperatives into socialist economies with a solid economic foundation, wealthy members, and firm political beliefs. Only in this way can we consolidate our Party's rural base like an iron wall.

The South Korean economy has become a famine-stricken area under the rule of the American-Li bandits

The socialist construction in the North is a guarantee for the peaceful reunification of Korea

Comrades:

Our motherland is divided into two parts, north and south. The socialist construction being carried out in the northern half of the Republic and the economic situation in South Korea present a stark contrast. Today, the economy of South Korea is increasingly heading towards bankruptcy.

The result of the American-Li bandits ruling South Korea for thirteen years is that only the bankruptcy of the national economy and the poverty, ignorance, darkness, and decadence of the people's lives are left.

Most of the factories and enterprises in South Korea are small and medium-sized enterprises, of which about 80% are either closed or have shortened production time.

Currently, there are more than 420,000 unemployed people roaming the streets in South Korea, and workers who are lucky enough to have jobs can only receive wages equivalent to one-third of the minimum living expenses, and they are often delayed for several months.

Our country's socialist agricultural cooperative economy is continuing to leap forward, but the agriculture of South Korea has not yet shaken off the semi-feudal status of a colonial appendage, and the productive forces are being seriously destroyed.

The cultivated area in South Korea has decreased by 60,000 mu compared to the period of Japanese imperialist rule; the total grain production has decreased by 40%. During the period of Japanese rule over Korea, the grain production of South Korea was twice that of North Korea, but now, the grain production of South Korea has significantly decreased compared to the northern half of the Republic.

South Korea, known as the "granary of Korea," has become a chronically famine-stricken area, and about half of the total number of farm households are in a state of food shortage.

Most of the farmers in South Korea have become tenant farmers or hired laborers without a single piece of land, or have become wandering beggars who have left their homes and villages.

However, the American imperialists and the Li bandits have allocated about 70% of the total budget for military and police expenses, completely ignoring the restoration of the agricultural economy. They ruthlessly squeeze the last drop of sweat from the emaciated farmers of South Korea.

This is the inevitable result of the colonial policy of the American imperialists in South Korea.

The only way out for the people of South Korea is to break free from the rule of American invaders and achieve the reunification of the motherland.

The farmers of South Korea have further realized that under the rule of the American-Li bandits, they will not be able to obtain land and freedom; they will not be able to get rid of today's indescribably miserable situation.

The greater the achievements of socialist construction in our rural areas and the higher the living standards of our farmers, the more we can inspire the courage and hope of the farmers of South Korea who are groaning under oppression, exploitation, and hunger and cold. (Applause)

The farmers of the northern half of the Republic, to save their fellow countrymen in South Korea, must further develop the agricultural economy and better build socialism.

The socialist construction in the northern half of the Republic will become a strong guarantee for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and will become a powerful material foundation for the rapid recovery of the South Korean economy and the improvement of the lives of the South Korean people after the reunification of the motherland.

As time goes by, the socialist forces in the northern half of the Republic will become stronger, and the revolutionary awareness of the South Korean people will be further enhanced. No force can stop the growth of the revolutionary forces of the Korean people yearning for the reunification of the motherland and the nation. (Thunderous applause)

On the unified territory of the motherland, all compatriots will gather together and live a free, prosperous, and happy life. (Thunderous applause that lasts for a long time)

Socialism has achieved decisive victories worldwide

The situation is favorable for the Korean people to accomplish great undertakings

Today, socialism has achieved decisive victories worldwide, and the forces of imperialism are on the road to decline.

The socialist camp, with the Soviet Union at its core, is far stronger than the imperialist camp.

The socialist camp occupies more than one-quarter of the vast land area of the entire globe and has nearly ten billion people, which is almost twice as many as the imperialist countries.

The great Soviet Union has achieved astonishingly great achievements in the economy and science and technology and has begun to surpass the United States.

The upcoming 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will discuss the new seven-year national economic plan, which is not only a grand program for the Soviet people to build communism but also further inspires all the people of the world to fight for peace and socialism. (Thunderous applause)

The Soviet Union has launched three artificial satellites, opening a new era in the history of scientific development. (Thunderous applause)

At the beginning of the new year, the Soviet Union launched a rocket to the moon. (Thunderous applause that lasts for a long time) This clearly shows that the science and technology of the Soviet Union are at the forefront of human science and culture, far surpassing the capitalist world led by the United States, opening up a world that humans have never known, and making great contributions to humanity. (Thunderous applause)

The launch of the Soviet rocket into space shows the superiority of socialism over capitalism and further strengthens the confidence of progressive people around the world in the future of communism. (Thunderous applause)

On behalf of the conference and all the people of Korea, I warmly congratulate the great achievements of the Soviet scientists, technicians, workers, and all the people of the Soviet Union. (The entire venue stands up, thunderous applause and cheers that last for a long time)

All people's democratic countries are effectively building socialism, and the people's economy is developing rapidly, and the people's lives are continuously improving.

Currently, the industrial production of socialist camp countries accounts for one-third of the world's industrial production, and in the next seven years, it will account for more than half of the world's industrial production.

The socialist camp countries, under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, with the Soviet Union as the center, have become more closely united.

All of this shows the invincible power of the socialist camp that overwhelms the forces of imperialism. (Thunderous applause)

All the developments of the situation are more favorable to the completion of our just and great cause.

Our people, together with the people of all brotherly countries, will advance side by side and will surely complete the socialist construction of our country and will definitely achieve the peaceful reunification of our motherland. (Thunderous applause that lasts for a long time)

In this way, our people will make contributions to the cause of further consolidating peace in the Far East and the world and the socialist camp.

Together with the working class, our farmers are the bearers of this glorious and great cause.

Our farmers' struggle to further develop agriculture is also a struggle to build socialism in the northern half of the Republic, and it is also a struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and prosperity in the future.

I am convinced that all the farmers of our country will further unite around our Party and, under the leadership of the Party, will surely complete the great task facing the agricultural sector. (The entire venue stands up, thunderous applause and cheers of "Long live the Workers' Party of Korea!" and "Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung!" that last for a long time)

    关于我国社会主义农业合作化的胜利和农业的今后发展问题
   （1959年1月5日在朝鲜全国农业合作社大会上的报告）
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相　金日成
      （全场起立，雷鸣般的掌声和“朝鲜劳动党万岁！”“金日成元帅万岁！”的欢呼声经久不息）同志们：
    今天，我们生活在我们祖国和我们民族的历史上从未有过的革命高潮和国家繁荣的时期。
    在我们党的领导下，我国人民克服战后恢复建设中的许多困难，奠定了自主的经济基础，保证了共和国北半部社会主义革命的决定性的胜利。（掌声）
    朝鲜社会主义建设已进入大高潮
    第一个五年计划将提早两年完成
    在这个基础上，我国社会主义建设已进入了大高潮；全体人民响应党的号召，以跨上千里马的气概，向前奔驰着。在社会主义建设的整个战线上，每天出现着惊人的奇迹，促成伟大的跃进。
    由于我国工人阶级的英勇劳动，具有现代化技术的许多工厂企业在接连不断地建立起来，工业生产力也在飞快地发展着。我国工业总产量，1957年比1956年增加了44％，1958年又增加了37％。去年，我国工人生产了相当于战前1949年的三点五倍的工业产品。
    同工业一起，农业、铁路、运输和基本建设等人民经济各部门都获得了巨大的成就。
    去年9月，我们党根据在社会主义建设中所取得的成就和我国劳动人民高涨的革命干劲，提出了促使我国转变为发达的社会主义工业国家的宏伟的前景任务。这一前景任务规定：在今后六、七年内，在重要工业产品的生产中，电力将增为二点六倍，煤炭为三点六倍，生铁和粒铁约为九倍，钢为八倍至九倍，水泥为四倍，化学肥料为三点三倍至四点三倍，布匹为四点六倍，农业的谷物生产约增加到二倍。
    这意味着我国按人口平均计算的产量，电力将达到两千瓩时，煤炭为两千五百公斤，生铁和粒铁共为四百公斤，钢为三百到三百五十公斤，水泥为五百公斤，化学肥料为一百五十到二百公斤，布匹为五十公尺，谷物为七百公斤以上。
    完成这些任务，我们就要建成我国人民渴望已久的社会主义社会，并将攀登上可以眺望到在很近的地平线上的人类的理想——共产主义社会的高峰。（掌声）同时将奠定促进我国的和平统一、保证我们祖国隆盛发展和我们民族将来繁荣的强有力的物质基础。
    我们党所提出的这个宏伟的前景任务，受到了我国劳动人民的热烈的支持，并且鼓舞他们新的更高涨的革命干劲。
    今天，我国劳动人民为了进一步促进共和国北半部的社会主义建设，一致决心提早两年完成当前的第一个五年计划，对党所提出的前景任务，不是在六、七年内，而是要在四、五年内提前完成，并正在发挥无比的劳动热情、无穷尽的创造精神和才能。（掌声）
    农业在社会主义建设中担负极重要任务
    合作化是发展农业生产力的唯一的道路
    在实现宏伟的社会主义建设纲领中，农业承担着极其重要的任务。不把农业生产力发展到更高的水平，就不可能给劳动人民供应丰足的粮食，也不可能为急速发展的工业提供充分的原料。
    在我们党的领导下，我国农民在恢复并发展农业生产力方面，已经取得了巨大的成就，并且完成了农业社会主义合作化。
    今天，我国农民为了进行农村的技术革命和文化革命，以使我国农村变为具有现代技术和富裕而文化的社会主义农村而奋斗。
    在这样的环境中所召开的这个农业合作社大会，不仅在我国农民的生活中，而且在我国全体人民的生活中，具有巨大的历史意义。
    在这个大会上，我们将总结我们党和在它的领导下我国农民在农业的社会主义改造中所取得的伟大胜利；我们还将总结我们在恢复被破坏的农村经济、进一步发展农业生产力、迅速改善贫困的农民生活等方面所取得的值得骄傲的成绩。（掌声）并且我们将全面地讨论摆在农业部门面前的新的战斗任务，为它的实现而更加勇敢地向前迈进。
    同志们：
    农业问题和农民问题，这在我国革命中，是最重要的问题之一。我们党一贯重视这个问题的解决。
    解放后，农村的土地问题，是摆在我们面前的急待解决的革命任务。
    曾经支配我国农村的封建土地所有制，不仅把数百万农民束缚于封建剥削和附属地位，限制了农业生产力的发展，而且是全面地阻挠社会进步的桎梏。因而，解决土地问题，是反帝反封建的民主革命中的基本内容。
    在农民的积极支持和参加下，由我们党和人民的政权所实施的历史性的土地改革，在农村中打碎了这个桎梏，把数百万农民从封建剥削中解放出来，并且开辟了发展农业生产力的道路。由于实施了土地改革，没收了属于日本帝国主义者和地主的一百万町步以上的土地，无偿地分给了七十多万无地或少地的农户。
    由于肃清了地主的土地所有制，土地归于耕种土地的农民所有，农业得到了迅速的发展，农民的生活也得到了显著的改善。
    土地改革加强了城市和农村、工业和农业的经济联系，巩固了工农联盟。
    这样，在我国实施的土地改革，是具有巨大的政治及经济意义的深刻的革命变革。
    但是土地改革，并没有最终地解决农民问题，也没有完全解放农业生产力。
    实施土地改革的结果，在我国农村小商品生产的个体农民经济占居了统治地位。正如列宁所说：“小生产是经常地，每日每时地，自发地大批产生着资本主义和资产阶级的。”（列宁：“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”）当然，在我国主权掌握在以工人阶级为核心的人民手中，基本生产资料集中于国家，并且彻底地实行了土地改革的情况下，农村的阶级分化，不得不受到极大的限制。但是在小商品经济的条件下，我们不能从根本上改善农民的生活，也不能最终地消除农村的剥削和贫穷的根源。
    小规模的、分散的个体农民经济，不但不能得到有计划地发展，而且大部分不能实现扩大再生产。
    很显然，如果小农经济仍占居统治地位，那么，我国农业在发展中必然会遇到一定的限制。与此相反，属于国有的我国社会主义工业，则按照国家的计划，得到了迅速的恢复发展，实现了不断的扩大再生产。我国的人民政权不能长期地停留在两个互不相同的经济基础上，即最大规模的、最集中的社会主义工业和最零碎的分散的个体农民经济。
    这个矛盾当时还摆在我们面前，是迟早要解决的问题。正如马克思列宁主义所指出，正如苏联的经验所证明，只有把个体农民经济引导到社会主义合作化的道路，才能最终地解决农民问题，才能把农业生产力从旧的生产关系的束缚中完全解放出来。
    战后在我国所造成的形势，给我们提出了必须以这种方法解决农业问题和农民问题的迫切任务。
    由于三年的战争，我国人民经济遭到了惨重的破坏，城市和农村变成了废墟，人民生活十分贫困，吃的和穿的都很缺乏。
    我们不得不在短时间内恢复工业和农业，奠定自主的经济基础，改善人民的贫苦生活。
    这时，最重要的问题之一，就是农业的迅速恢复和发展，特别是居民的粮食问题的解决。
    由于战争，农业的物质基础惨遭破坏，农村的劳动力和畜力极为缺乏，农民经济变得更加零细，农业的经济基础更加削弱了。
    在这种情况下，小商品生产的农民经济的一切限制性表现得更加明显了。
    如果依然保持个体农民经济，就不能迅速地恢复惨遭破坏的农业，也不能解决战后时期十分困难的粮食问题。很明显，这对迅速恢复发展工业，进而对整个人民经济的恢复事业，有着很大的影响。于是，社会主义工业和个体农民经济之间的矛盾，在我国战后的情况下，很可能造成迅速恢复发展并且发生质量变化的工业和极为缓慢恢复的农业之间的深刻的不平衡。
    同时，在不能消除剥削和贫苦根源的小农经济的基础上，是不能迅速改善农民的贫苦生活的，特别是不能解决在战时增多的贫农的问题的。
    战后时期，解决我国农业面前一切困难的唯一道路，就是个体农民经济的合作化。
    只有农业的社会主义改造，才能保证被破坏的农业生产力的迅速恢复和进一步发展，才能保证工业和农业的平衡发展。只有在社会主义合作经济的基础上，才能迅速地安定贫困的农民生活，进而从根本上改善农民的生活。
    根据这种情况，我们党在停战后1953年8月召开的党中央委员会第六次全体会议上，提出了农业合作化的任务。
    农业合作化是在社会主义革命中最艰巨的任务之一。列宁曾指出：
  “由个体小农经济转变到共耕制是涉及生活习惯的深厚根基的、千百万人生活上的大转变，只有经过长期的努力才能达到，只有现实迫使人们非改变自己的生活不可的时候，这种转变一般才是能够实现的。”
    我国的农业合作化运动，早在战前就开始逐渐进行准备工作，到农民在生活中成为迫切要求的时候，才把它当成当前的任务提出来。
    在进行反帝反封建的民主革命的过程中，我们推翻了地主和买办资本家，并把基本生产资料归于国家所有，为农业的社会主义改造创造了重要的前提条件。
    在实行土地改革时，我们没收了地主的土地和一切不以自力耕种的土地；土地改革后，严格禁止土地的买卖、抵押、出佃等。在土地改革所取得的这种结果，不仅得以肃清地主阶级，而且给在我国原来势力薄弱的富农以很大的打击，大大地限制了他们的发展。
    在完成民主改革的基础上，我国人民政权开始执行从资本主义逐渐过渡到社会主义的过渡时期的任务。党和政府一方面迅速地发展社会主义工业，并在流通部门中扩大国营和合作社营的商业，从而不断地加强人民经济各部门中的社会主义因素。另一方面，通过捐税和价格政策等，控制并限制了资本主义因素的发展。
    与此同时，迅速地发展了城市和乡村、社会主义工业和个体农民经济之间的经济联系，更加有计划地调整个体农民经济的发展。
    此外，我们党已在战前建立了国营农场、畜牧场和农业机器代耕站，向农民显示了农业机械化和大规模经济的优越性，并进行了引导他们逐渐走上社会主义道路的准备工作。
    特别是在战争时期，我们党曾把主要力量放在农村工作上，显著地扩大了国营农业，同时为了克服农村中劳动力、畜力和农具的严重缺乏状况，在农民中广泛地推广并发展了在我国具有悠久传统的插犋、互助等集体劳动的组织形式。这使得我国农民进一步发扬了互助合作的风气，加强了走向合作经济的愿望。
    党正确地领导农民逐步走上合作化道路
    朝鲜农业合作化运动已在去年胜利完成
    同志们：
    我们党是非常慎重地并且认真地领导农业合作化运动的。
    党在领导农业合作化运动时，严格遵守了列宁的自愿原则，采取了使农民通过实际体验，认识合作经济的优越性，然后把它发展成为群众性运动的方针。
    刚停战后，在农村中最积极地拥护和接受我们党的农业合作化方针的是贫农。由于他们生活十分穷困，并且通过党的耐心教育，使他们认识到：如不改造自己的经济，就不能改善生活，只有走社会主义合作经济的道路，才能给他们带来幸福。
    党坚决依靠这些贫农和农村中的党的积极分子，动员他们在每个郡先组织几个农业合作社。
    这是我国农业合作化运动中的试办阶段。这个阶段的目的在于：一方面使工作人员积累关于组织合作经济的经验，并使他们取得开展农业合作化运动的胜利信心；另一方面，以实际成果向全体农民特别是向中农证实合作经济的优越性，以争取他们成批地参加合作化运动。（掌声）
    使得耕种最瘠薄的土地、畜力和农具比谁都缺乏、生活最困难的贫农组成的农业合作社得到发展和巩固，显示出比个体经济的优越性，是十分艰巨的工作。但是我们确信我们可以做到。
    列宁曾经教导我们，不管任何社会制度，只有在一定的阶级的财政支援下才可以产生，社会主义国家在普通程度以上须要支援的制度，是合作制度。这个教导成为了我们工作的指针。
    党和国家积极领导了在初期组织的合作社的经营管理工作，并且尽一切力量帮助了合作社。例如，贷放粮食和种谷，优先供应肥料和农具，在财政上给予贷款，并且支援劳动力等等。（掌声如雷）
    由于国家的这种帮助和社员们的忘我劳动，农业合作社开始逐渐显示了它的优越性。
    在1954年，合作经济部门的谷物单位面积产量，比个体农民经济增加了10％至50％，现款收入增加了两倍至七倍。（掌声）
    于是，我国的贫农，在党的领导和国家的帮助下，勇敢地克服种种困难向前迈进，在农业合作化运动中起到了光荣的先驱者的作用。
    他们所组织的农业合作社，同当时在农村中占优势的个体农民经济相比较，虽然看起来很微弱，没有什么了不起，但它们是新生的萌芽，它们是在我国整个农村中燃起社会主义革命火炬的伟大的力量。（掌声）
    这些农业合作社如实地显示了自己的优越性。由于我们党在广大农民群众中不懈地进行了组织工作和政治工作，不仅贫农，而且连中农也参加了合作化运动。于是我国的农业合作化运动，进入了群众性的发展阶段。
    随着农民群众成批地加入合作经济，关于规定合作经济的形式和规模等问题，就成为非常重要的问题了。
    我们党考虑到土地属于农民私有、农民的经济情况和觉悟程度不同的事实，在提倡合作化运动的初期，就规定了合作经济的三种形式，并在组织合作社的时候，指导农民根据具体情况选择合适的组织形式。合作经济的第一种形式是共同进行劳动的固定的劳动互助组；第二种形式是合并土地，统一经营，按劳动和土地进行分配的半社会主义形式；第三种形式是合并土地和基本生产资料，按劳分配的完整的社会主义形式。
    组织合作社的时候，我们没有机械地对社员们的耕畜和农具等加以合并，而根据他们的愿望，实行合并或者在一定时期内共同使用，但仍然保留为私人所有。如果归社公有，必须给予应有的代价。
    合作经济的三种形式和对生产资料的这种合并方式，使中农容易接受合作经济。并且还在事前防止了合作化过程中可能发生的种种偏向。
    由于经营合作经济的经验不足，管理干部的水平不高，我国农业生产的技术水平又较低，因此，在农业合作社的规模方面，我们党规定组织较小的即四十户到一百户左右的合作社。农业合作社的这种规模完全适合于当时的情况。
    我国的农业合作化运动，是合作经济的数量上的增长和质量上的巩固相结合的。随着农民的热情的提高，党积极推进了合作化运动；同时为了从政治和经济上巩固已有的农业社，党和国家集中主要的力量进行了领导工作。特别是，从1955年年初起，我们曾动员数千名中央和地方的干部，每年进行了一两次的集中领导。这在我国农业合作化运动发展中起了重要作用。
    我们通过这种领导工作，正确地选拔和分配干部，在年青的合作社中建立社会主义的秩序和制度，在社员群众中加强了社会主义教育，迅速地发展了生产，巩固了合作社的经济基础，在短时间内改善社员的生活方面获得了巨大的成就。（掌声）在巩固农业合作社方面，具有决定性作用的是工人阶级的国家的支援。
    在战后年间，国家为了兴修水利灌溉工程，扩大农业机器代耕站网，培养农业技术人材，对农业部门的投资共达一百二十亿圆。战后时期，我们党采取了优先发展重工业的方针，特别是把力量集中到对农业和轻工业的发展迫切需要的重工业部门。于是，国家向农村供应了大量的化学肥料、农业机器、建设材料和各种消费品。
    与此同时，战后年间，国家给经济基础薄弱的农业合作社和贫农发放了三十多万吨贷粮和种谷、二百四十三亿圆以上农业贷款，豁免了十六万吨以上的现物税粮、贷粮和十四亿圆以上贷款。
    从1956年起，为了减轻农民的负担，提高他们的生产积极性，全面实行了固定的现物税制，显著地降低了税率，同时减低了农业合作社现物税量的5％。
    为了解决农村中极为缺乏的劳动力问题，在战后期间，我们党把数万名复员军人和许多初高中毕业生分配到农村。并在每年的农忙季节，动员许多职员、学生和军人，给予数百万人工的劳动力的帮助。
    虽然战后我国的情况那样艰苦，加上合作经济在我国是新建立的制度，因而很缺乏经验，但由于我们党的这种正确领导和国家的大力帮助，以及为它所鼓舞的我国农民的忘我劳动，我国能够把从数量上迅速增长的农业合作社，在短短的时间内，从政治经济上巩固起来，并保证了农业生产力的继续发展和农民生活的迅速改善。（掌声如雷）
    随着农业合作社的日益巩固，它的优越性表现得更加显明，农业合作化运动更加促进了它的发展。
    基于农业合作化所取得的这种经验和成就，我们党的第三次代表大会提出了关于在第一个五年计划期间完成农业合作化的历史性的任务。
    为了在最短时间内实现党的第三次代表大会所提出的关于完成农业合作化的任务，我们党在巩固已取得的成就，同时对合作化运动开展较差的地区集中力量加以领导。
    在这个时期还没有参加农业合作社的阶层，主要是富裕农民、住在城市郊区从事农业兼营买卖的农民、住在分散的山区农民以及新解放地区的农民。
    在吸收所有这些农民加入农业合作社的时候，党仍然贯彻自愿原则，坚持了继续巩固已组织的合作经济，使没有入社的农民认清合作经济的优越性和有利性后自动参加农业合作社的方针。
    这样，到1958年8月底，我国的农业合作化运动胜利地完成了。（雷鸣般的掌声经久不息）
    这是在我国农村掀起的伟大的革命，也是我们党的农业政策的辉煌胜利。
    我国农村已经完全消灭了数千年来的剥削和贫穷的所有根源，改造成为劳动农民共同劳动、共同过自由幸福生活的社会主义农村。我国数百万农民从过去束缚于一小块土地的小生产者转变成为有组织的、大规模的合作经济的主人，转变成为光荣的社会主义的劳动者。（掌声）
    农业生产力从旧的生产关系的束缚中获得了彻底的解放，进入了有广阔前途的发展途径。
    由于农业合作化运动取得了胜利，工农联盟在新的社会主义的基础上，得到了进一步的巩固。
    掌握了政权的我国工人阶级，发挥了坚强的斗志和高昂的革命气概，保证了国家对农民的支援和坚定不渝的领导，向数百万农民证实了他们伟大事业的正确性，并把农民紧紧地团结在自己的周围。（掌声）
    农业合作化又促进了城市私营工商业的社会主义改造。我国私营工商业的力量原来就比较薄弱，它主要基于农村的小商品生产。由于个体农民经济的合作化，城市资本主义因素的最后地盘被摧毁了。所以，在我国同时进行了而且几乎同时完成了农业的合作化和私营工商业的社会主义改造。
    在停战后不到四、五年的时间内，我国正确地、同时比较很顺利地保证了这项伟大的艰巨的变革。（掌声如雷）
    依靠贫农加强同中农联盟限制和改造富农
    这是党在农村中所采取的基本的阶级政策
    同志们：
    我们是怎样在短短的时间内这样顺利地完成了像农业合作化这样从根本上改变数百万农民生活的繁重任务的呢？
    那是因为我们党把马克思列宁主义和苏联的丰富经验与我国的现实相结合，提出了我国农业合作化运动的正确路线，克服种种困难，同时毫不动摇地为它的贯彻而展开了斗争；同时还因为我国农民坚决支持党的农业合作化政策，积极参加了这一运动。（掌声）
    我国的农业合作化运动，是通过阶级斗争而得到了胜利的。
    被推翻的剥削阶级并没有放弃恢复旧制度的妄想，加上我们祖国仍被分裂为南北两部分，我们直接和敌人相对峙着，在这种情况下，我们在合作化运动的过程中，不得不展开反对敌人的破坏行为的斗争。
    阶级敌人疯狂地企图从内外来破坏我们的农业合作社，他们诽谤党的政策，制造反动谣言，诬蔑农业合作化运动，侵犯共同财产，并进行了破坏生产等罪恶活动。特别是当农业合作化接近完成、城市和农村的社会主义胜利日趋巩固的时候，反革命分子的蠢动、破坏和暗害行为更加疯狂起来了。
    我们党加强对农民群众的政治思想工作，使他们提高社会主义思想和革命警惕性，并且组织和展开了群众性的肃清反革命分子的运动。
    于是，我们在农村随时揭露和粉碎了敌人的一切策动，保障了合作化运动的胜利进行，坚强地保卫了社会主义的胜利果实。
    我们党在加强同反革命斗争的同时，在农业合作化运动中，坚持了马克思列宁主义关于农民问题的原则。农民问题，是关于工人阶级的同盟者的问题，是关于工人阶级和它的政党对农民各个阶层的态度问题。
    坚决依靠贫农，加强同中农的联盟，限制和改造富农，这是我们党在农村中所采取的基本的阶级政策。
    我国农村中的阶级关系，绝对有利于农业合作化运动的开展。在进行合作化运动的初期，我国农村各阶层的构成如下：贫农约占40％，富农不过0.6％；中农中的多数是土地改革后上升为中农的。当时，贫农迫不及待地准备参加合作社；新中农中的大部分也从一开始就拥护合作化；其余的中农则动摇和犹豫，采取看风使舵的态度；富农则冷眼相看或反对。
    我们党对于摇摆不定的中农，力求通过耐心的解释、说服和现实教育，吸收他们到合作社来；对于富农则在严格地限制他们的剥削行为，同时吸收愿意老老实实地参加劳动的人入社，把他们改造成为社会主义劳动者；至于极少数的妨害合作化运动的坏分子，则加以应有的制裁。
    随着合作化运动进入完成阶段，农村中的剥削对象消灭，合作经济更加巩固，富农开始自愿加入农业合作社。
    我们党的这种阶级政策，保证了农业合作化运动在健全的基础上发展，加强了同中农的联盟，并保证了对富农的社会主义改造。
    我们党在农业合作化过程中，随时克服了一些急躁情绪和保守主义思想。
    党严格地防止违反自愿原则、用行政的方法把农民引入合作经济的倾向，并且及时纠正了急躁地只顾合作社的数量上增加，或硬要组织高级形式和规模大的合作社等的倾向。
    与此相反，也还有一些人说合作化运动“时机尚早”，或为我国农业合作化运动的急速发展而惊惶、倒退。
    当我们党提出农业合作化方针的时候，曾有一部分人对党的农业合作化政策表示怀疑地说：“现在南北还没有统一，怎能搞合作化呢？”或者说：“现在连机器等什么都没有，怎能搞合作化呢？”
    这些人不懂得：共和国北半部的社会主义建设，就是实现我们祖国和平统一的决定性保证。
    共和国北半部的农业合作化和全面的社会主义建设，是从北半部社会经济发展的必然要求出发的。虽然南半部尚未解放，但我们不能停滞在一个地方等待，不能抑制北半部社会的发展。
    毫无疑问，如果我们不在北半部进行社会主义建设，那末，就不能从政治、经济上巩固我们的革命根据地——北半部，因而也不可能促进我们祖国的和平统一。
    我国的农业合作化是在几乎没有进行农业技术改造的环境下进行的。
    列宁曾经指出，单纯地合并农民的土地和农具的合作经济，也可以把经济改进为个体小农经济不可能达到的程度。假如由这种分散的个体农民经济过渡到合作经济，劳动生产率就会提高到二倍到三倍，人类劳动就会节省到二倍到三倍。
    我们的经验完全证实了列宁教导的正确性。我国的农业合作社虽然建立在手工业式的技术基础上，但它仍然充分显示了比个体农民经济优越，并且为农业广泛采用现代科学和技术成就创造了条件。
    一部分的人看到我国农业合作化运动以这样空前的速度向前发展，并且从最初起就是第三种形式占绝对优势，感到有些畏惧，并且犹豫不定。但是我国实施了最彻底的土地改革，在农村中反对合作化运动的势力极为微弱；相反地，农民通过长期的革命斗争，尤其通过艰苦的战争考验，提高了政治觉悟，得到了锻炼；同时还因为他们的整个经济比较零细；在这些条件下，合作化运动的这种发展行程，是完全合乎规律的。
    我党在克服这一切偏向的同时，坚决依靠农村中的党组织和革命力量，动员农民掀起高度的热情，大胆地、积极地推动了农业合作化运动。
    合作化运动促进了农业的全面飞跃发展
    朝鲜农民生活普遍提高到中农以上水平
    同志们：
    我国农业合作化的巨大成就，以及基于马克思列宁主义原则的我们党农业政策的战无不胜的生命力，很清楚地表现在战后时期农业的飞跃发展方面。
    战后时期，摆在农业部门面前的最重要的任务，就是要迅速地增产谷物，解决居民的粮食问题。
    我们党为了保证谷物的增产，采取了重要的技术上和经济上的措施：大力兴修水利灌溉工程，迅速增加对农村的化学肥料、各种农业机器和农具等的供应量，并广泛采用了各种先进的耕作技术。
    兴修水利灌溉工程，对提高单位面积产量，增产谷物，具有决定性的意义。
    在战后五年期间，国家对水利灌溉工程的投资，占对整个农业部门投资总额的57％。除了用国家的资金兴修大规模的水利灌溉工程外，各农业社还以自力广泛地进行了中、小型水利灌溉工程的建设。于是在战后五年内，我国的水田灌溉面积由二十二万七千町步扩大到四十六万三千町步。这意味着占水田总面积的91％的水田，已变为水利安全田了。
    在扩大灌溉面积的同时，还广泛地展开了河川堤防和水土保持等的建设工程，并广泛地进行了植树造林工作，从洪水和潮水的侵害中保护了三十五万多町步的耕地。
    1958年对农村的化学肥料供给量，增加到1953年的十二倍，农业机器和农具的供应量也迅速地增加了。
    与此同时，我们扩大了农业机器代耕站网，拖拉机（按十五马力计算）的数目增加到四倍，它的翻耕面积扩大到十二倍。
    在集体经济的条件下，广泛推广了过去个体农民经济时不可能采用的新的先进的耕作方法。并根据因地制宜的原则，进一步改进了农作物的分布。
    到1958年，在水稻生产方面，能够比水苗显著提高产量的冷床苗的栽植面积占整个水田面积的50％；在棉花生产方面，采用营养坛假植法的种植面积，占整个棉田的70％；高产作物玉米的种植面积，由1954年的二十三万六千町步增加到八十二万六千町步；在同期内，土地利用率由125％增加到161％。
    由于集体经济的优越性，加上这一切技术措施和我国农民的忘我劳动，我国的谷物产量得到了不断迅速的增长。
    1956年，谷物产量已经超过了战前的水平，产量达到二百八十七万吨，1957年达到了三百二十万吨，1958年达到了三百七十万吨。（掌声如雷）1958年度的谷物总产量，约相当于解放后1946年的二倍。这是几千年来我们的祖先根本想像不到的丰收。必须指出的是：谷物生产的这种增长，是在连续严重干旱的极其不利的气候条件下取得的。
    许多先进的农业合作社，创造了更为惊人的丰产纪录。平安南道江南郡斗岩农业合作社，去年在一百六十町步水田里，每町步平均收获了十三吨稻子，其中在一点五町步试验田里，取得了一町步生产五十五吨的成绩。
    顺川郡三龙农业合作社，在四百二十二町步的玉米地里，每町步平均收获了三点六吨，其中十二町步的平均产量为十八吨；黄海南道瓮津郡苑寺农业合作社的小麦町步产量最高达四点五吨。
    毫无疑问，如果我们没有进行农业合作化，就不能胜利地实现发展农业的各种技术措施，也不能使农民掀起高涨的生产热情，因之就不可能取得像今天这样我国在历史上从未有过的谷物丰收。（掌声如雷）
    我们完全解决了粮食困难的问题。
    同谷物产量的增加一起，经济作物的生产、畜牧业、蚕业和果木业等农业的其他部门也得到了迅速的发展。我们的集体经济，不仅在保障谷物生产的增长中显示了自己的优越性，而且在农业的多方面发展中起了决定性的作用。
    1958年，棉花的町步产量达到1953年的二倍，总产量增加到三倍。黄海南道载宁郡三支江农业合作社，在六十一町步的棉田里，每町步平均收获了三吨棉花，其中在五町步的棉田里，每町步取得了六点七吨的高产。在亚麻、烟和其他经济作物等生产方面，也取得了显著的成果。
    在畜牧业方面，截至1958年9月1日止，牛增加到1953年年底的一点三倍，猪增加到二点八倍，肉类产量在战后五年内增加到三点二倍。
    由于展开了在第一个五年计划期间扩大十万町步果木园的全民性的运动，现在已经开垦了五万三千多町步适合于种植果木的土地。在蚕业部门，1958年的蚕茧产量达到了战前最高水平的一点六倍，即八千七百吨。
    这样，社会主义赢得胜利的我国农业部门，最近年间在以谷物生产为主的所有部门中，掀起了全面的高潮和革新。
    农业生产的急剧增长，巩固了农业合作社的经济基础，迅速改善了社员的生活。
    合作社公共积累的比例，截至1956年止，约占纯收入的5％。但到社员的生活得到改善的1957年，约提高到10％，到1958年提高到15％以上。去年我国农业合作社的公共财产总额约达六百八十六亿圆，每社平均五百十五万圆，每农户平均六万五千圆。
    这同1955年相比，每户平均提高到二点四倍。这样，我国农业合作社奠定了能够不断扩大再生产的巩固基础。
    虽然每年积累很多的公共积累基金，逐年扣除更多的种籽、饲料基金和肥料交换粮，但是如下表所说明，社员的收入仍然不断地增长。
                    合作社每户平均收入增长表
                   1955年 　1956年 　1957年　 1958年
    谷物　（公斤）　1，250　1，616 　1，742  　1，826
    薯类　（公斤）　193　    357　    434　    501
    现款　（圆）　  5，605　9，542　 13，703　 20，350
  上表表明，1958年同1955年相比，每个农户的平均收入，谷物增加到一点五倍，薯类增加到二点六倍，现款增加到三点六倍。
    刚停战后，约占总农户40％的贫农现在已经不再存在了。我国农民的生活已经普遍提高到中农以上的水平。（掌声如雷）
    今天，我国的农村，拆掉了几千年来相继居住的小草房，正在迅速地转变成为清洁而美丽的社会主义文化农村。战后期间，在我国农村中已建成了许许多多的美丽舒适的文化住宅；到处建立了学校、俱乐部、托儿所、幼儿园和诊疗所；开办了澡塘、理发馆、洗衣房，供社员们利用于集体文化生活。由于全面地实施了初等及中等义务教育制，以及进一步加强了成人教育工作，农民的文化水平正在迅速提高，技术知识也在农民中间更加广泛地普及起来。
    农民的思想也发生了巨大的变化。封建的、资本主义的旧思想残余正在被肃清，他们的思想正在改造成为社会主义的思想。
    在社会主义集体经济的道路上找到了幸福的我国农民，充满着保卫自己珍贵的胜利果实的坚定不移的决心。他们清楚地看到更加光明的未来，抱着千百倍的勇气和信心，响应党的号召，跨上千里马向前奔驰着。（掌声）
    生产力的飞跃发展，集体经济的进一步巩固，农民生活的迅速改善，我国农民高昂的革命气概，这些都是农业合作化在我国农村中取得胜利的结果，也是我们党的农业政策在我国农村中取得胜利的结果。（掌声如雷）
    我国农民应当为他们在党的领导下所取得的社会主义革命的伟大胜利和社会主义建设的伟大业绩而自豪！（雷鸣般的掌声经久不息）
    农业社合并工作已在短时间内顺利完成
    党在实现和巩固合作化中获得宝贵经验
    同志们：
  我国农业合作社虽然是在战后十分艰苦的条件下组织起来的，它的历史很短，并且经验不多，但清楚地显示了它的无比的优越性。
    但是，社会主义集体经济不会停滞不前，应当向前发展，并更加巩固。
    农业生产力在迅速发展，因而我国小规模的农业合作社就不能适应生产力进一步发展的需要。它妨碍土地的合理利用、劳动组织的改善、农业的多种发展，特别是妨碍农业机械化的实现，并且使广泛开展的农村建设事业造成不合理的现象。
    为了胜利地进行当前农村中的技术革命和进一步发展农业生产力，就有必要把农业合作社合并起来，扩大它的规模。在各农业合作社在政治、经济上得到了巩固、管理干部的领导水平和业务能力有所提高的条件下，这更是已所成熟的要求。同时，我国农民也认识到小规模农业合作社的不合理，迫切地要求加以合并。
    因此，我们党在去年10月决定：以里行政区域为单位，把里的农业合作社合并成为一个社，由里人民委员长兼任社管理委员长。
    合并农业合作社是件复杂的工作，但是由于农民群众的政治热忱十分高涨，在短短的一两个月的时间内顺利地完成了。（掌声）结果，把原来的一万三千三百零九个农业合作社合并成三千八百四十三个社，社的规模从每社平均八十户增加到三百户左右；在耕地面积方面，由一百三十町步扩大到五百町步。
    农业合作社的合并，使我们可以大规模地开展土地整理工作，更加广泛地采用现代化的农业机器和先进农业技术，进一步合理地利用自然经济条件，从各方面发展集体经济，防止劳动力和资材的浪费，有计划地、迅速地促进庞大的农村建设。
    同时，由于里人民委员长兼任管理委员长，可使地方政权更加接近生产，进一步加强它在农村经济和文化建设方面的作用和职能。
    在合并农业合作社的同时，我们还把农村消费合作社商店和信用合作社，移交给农业合作社直接经营。这件事的巨大意义在于农业合作社不仅加强了对农业生产而且对流通和信用工作等方面的关心，从而进一步增进社员的生活福利；同时得以全面地规划社内一切经济活动，提高它的自主性和创造性。
    这又是进一步加强城市和农村之间的经济联系、更加巩固工农联盟的重要措施。
    这样，在战后五年期间，我国保证了农业合作化的胜利，更加巩固了农业合作社，并把它提高到新的发展阶段。
    通过这些斗争，我们党、我国农民和全体人民，取得了宝贵的经验：
    第一，我们的经验清楚地说明，我们选择的农业合作化道路是最正确的道路。因为我们按照马克思列宁主义的教导，按照苏联在社会主义建设中的经验，引导个体农民经济走上了社会主义集体经济的道路，所以才能在战后艰苦的环境中，迅速地恢复和发展了农村经济，改善了农民生活，并且为我国农村逐渐变为具有现代技术的、富裕而文化的社会主义农村而奠定了基础。
    第二，我国的经验证明，在没有现代化机械和技术的条件下，就是手工式的技术在农业中占统治地位的条件下，也能实现农业合作化；在这种基础上组织起来的集体农业经济，也绝对比个体农民经济优越。我国因为实行了农业合作化，农业才能得到迅速地恢复和发展，并加速了技术改造。
    第三，我国农业合作化运动的胜利证明，党的政策是正确的。党在群众中的威信是很高的。同时当群众通过实际斗争，确信党的政策的正确性，并为实现党的政策而一致站起来的时候，就没有什么克服不了的困难，能够胜利地完成任何艰巨和繁重的任务。（掌声如雷）
    我们党坚定不移的领导，群众对党的无限的信任和群众高昂的革命干劲，这些就是农村经济的社会主义改造取得胜利的决定性的保证，是我们一切胜利的决定性的保证。
    同志们：
    我国农村已经完全摆脱了过去的贫穷、停滞和落后的状态，踏踏实实地走上了发展社会主义的新道路。在我们党的领导下，我国农民在农村的社会主义革命中获得了胜利，在社会主义建设中也获得了巨大的成就。
    但是，我们绝不能为已经取得的胜利和成果而自满，我们没有任何理由可以自满。我们仅不过是奠定了促使农业发展到新的更高阶段的基础而已。主要的问题在于：在这个基础上，加速农业生产力的发展，进一步改善农民的生活。
    进行技术和文化革命是当前农村基本任务
    水利化机械化电气化是技术革命基本内容
    今天，我国农业部门的基本任务是：在最近几年内，在农村进行技术革命和文化革命，以便从政治上及经济上进一步巩固社会主义集体经济，促使我国农村转变成为具有现代技术的、富裕和文化的社会主义农村。
    为了在农村进行社会主义建设，不仅要改造生产关系，还要实现农业的技术改造，改造农民的思想。
    技术革命是今天我国农业部门最迫切、最重要的任务。如果不把农业用现代技术装备起来，就不可能保证社会主义社会的高度的生产力。
    我国农业的发展，主要取决于技术改造。
    我们要从技术上改造农业，以便加速农业生产的发展，使劳动更加省劲。
    我们的目的是要更快地发展工业，并促使农业也能像工业一样奠定现代化的技术基础，以便建设社会主义，进而建设共产主义。
    农业的技术改造，将逐步地消灭工业和农业、城市和乡村之间的本质上的差别，迅速提高农民的技术水平，并促进农民的思想改造。
    正如我们党所指出的，水利化、机械化和电气化，是我国农村进行技术革命的基本内容。我们要在两、三年内完成旱田、水田的水利化，一、两年内完成农村的电气化；四、五年内实现农业机械化。（掌声如雷）
    今天，我国有着完成这一庞大任务的种种可能性。
    我国的农业已经实现了合作化，农业合作社已经合并为更大的社，它的经济基础得到了进一步的巩固。
    我国有着强有力的重工业基地。由于我们党采取了保证重工业优先发展的正确的经济政策，我国工人阶级进行了英勇的劳动，因之我国工业就可给农村生产并供应大量的铁材、建筑材料、拖拉机和载重汽车等各种先进农业机器。
    主要问题在于，要善于组织目前我国农民的高涨的热情，把这一切可能性转变成为现实。
    一两年内将把灌溉面积扩大到一百万町步
    这些耕地面积能充分解决朝鲜的粮谷问题
    水利化问题，是我国农业技术改造中的基本问题。在我国耕地面积有限、稻谷生产占重要地位、每年有相当长期间的干旱，夏天又常有洪水泛滥等的情况下，建立水田和旱田的灌溉系统，防止水灾和旱灾，在提高单位面积产量和增加农业生产方面，具有决定性的意义。
    由于我们党一贯实行关于扩大灌溉面积的措施，水田灌溉已基本上完成。今天水利化的中心任务，是迅速建立旱田灌溉系统。我们要在继续扩大水田面积的同时，要广泛进行旱田灌溉。只有这样，才能在占总耕地面积三分之二以上的旱田上，迅速提高谷物产量，进一步促进经济作物、蔬菜和果木业等生产的发展。去年各先进农业社和国营农牧场的经验证明：在建立旱田灌溉系统的条件下，玉米和小麦的町步产量提高到灌水前的二倍至三倍，棉花提高到三倍至四倍，水果提高到二倍。建立旱田灌溉系统，又能显著地提高土地利用率，并且为综合性机械化的发展造成非常有利的条件。
    党中央委员会曾在1958年9月全会提出了战斗性的任务：要在今后两、三年内，建立七十万町步旱田的灌溉系统，新造三十多万町步的水利安全田，除了斜度较大的坡地外，要在一百四十万町步的耕地面积上全面建立灌溉系统。这是我们一代实现我们祖先数千年来所梦想的切实的愿望——伟大的自然改造计划。
    为党的决议所鼓舞的我国农民，为了实现这个计划而总动员起来了。今天各农村和农业合作社到处劈山拦海，改造山河，兴修许多水利灌溉工程。
    目前包括岐阳、于?屯和鸭绿江流域地区等大规模的国营灌溉工程在内的一万多处灌溉工程正在施工，预计今年可以灌溉的面积，水田达六万五千町步，旱田达二十三万町步。
    这说明我们党提出的有历史意义的伟大事业——水利化，正在有效地进行。
    但是，现在我们在建立旱田灌溉系统中只不过才走上了第一步。在我们面前还有庞大的工程需要建设，并且今后要建设的工程需要更多的劳动力、材料和复杂的技术。
    在九月全会所提出的任务中，我们首先要扩大五十至六十万町步的灌溉面积，以便在一、两年内把整个灌溉面积扩大到一百万町步。根据我们的估计，只以这些耕地面积就能充分解决我国的粮谷问题。在一、两年内要把灌溉面积由现有的四十六万多町步扩大到一百万町步，这是我们实现水利化的当前第一阶段的任务。
    在进行灌溉工程的同时，要广泛地进行河川治理和水土保持工程，并要扩大土地保护面积。
    我国因为还没有做好治山治水工作，常有因水灾而流失耕田或减低产量等现象。我们必须整理河川，兴筑堤坝，营造保护林，广泛进行水土保持工程，防止洪水泛滥。特别是在常有洪水泛滥的东海岸地区，必须以治山治水为主，同时进行水利灌溉工程。
    在进行水利灌溉工程方面也不例外，大规模的由国家直接进行，中小规模的由各农业合作社负责进行。
    水利化是改造自然的伟大事业，是永远为国家和社会利益服务的百年大计，因此，必须展开全民性的运动来进行。不仅是农民，而且全体人民都要参加这项事业。
    工人要及时生产和供应灌溉工程所需的水泥、钢材、木材、各种电动机和抽水机。职员、学生和军人，要直接参加灌溉工程的建设。战后，我国的职员、学生、军人和全体人民普遍参加了建设灌溉工程的劳动，给予国家和农民巨大的帮助，并积累了丰富的经验。我们今后仍要继续动员广大的社会劳动支援灌溉建设工程。
    灌溉工程中急待解决的问题，是各地工地必须提高机械化水平的问题。如果不实现机械化，就不能完成需要数亿个劳动力的这项庞大的工程。在岐阳、于?屯等地的大规模的国营灌溉工程的建筑中，我们已经采用了各种建筑机器，大部分作业已经机械化了。对今年动工的大规模的工程，还将供应大量的挖土机、推土机、皮带传送机等建筑机器。国家将迅速增加这种建筑机器的生产量，以促进灌溉建设工程的机械化。但是对一万多处的中小灌溉工程，则不能一下子全部供应现代化的建筑机器。
    去年，平安南道在挖土、积土和搬运作业中采用了木制起重机、推车和铁索等简单的中小型机械的结果，不仅比计划节省了四万五千个劳动力，并在去年年底提前完成了原计划在今年开工的工程的土方工作。各灌溉建设工地要大力地实行简便易行的中小机械化，为进一步节约劳动力和减轻劳动而斗争。
    为了节约建设灌溉工程所需的劳动力和材料，首先必须彻底地进行调查设计工作。我们要在合理、综合利用水利资源的原则下，正确地选定工程对象，把一些灌溉设备构成为互相联系的一个统一体系，防止在施工中或在完工以后改变构造物或水渠等现象。同时要进一步提高工程的质量，最大限度地利用已经完成的灌溉设备。
    今后四五年内大量生产拖拉机和载重汽车
    将使田间作业和运输作业全面实现机械化
    同水利化一起，机械化在农村技术革命中也占有重要的地位。
    农业合作化以后，发展了多种经济，广泛地采用了先进的集约经营，进行了灌溉建设等庞大的农村建设，以及搬运工作的迅速增加等等，这些造成了农村劳动力的紧张和农业机器及输送器材的严重缺乏。因此，不实行机械化，就不能解决农村劳动力的问题，也不能促使我国农业前进一步。以现代化的农业机器代替世纪以来相传已久的落后的手工式的农具的时期，已经到来了。
    农业经济的机械化，是节约劳动力、减轻农民的劳动、增加生产、降低农产品成本的重要途径。
    实现农业的机械化，最重要的问题是向农村供应我国已经开始大量生产的拖拉机和载重汽车的问题。今年我国将向农村供应五千辆拖拉机和二千五百辆载重汽车。
    我国农村的田间作业和搬运作业全面实现机械化，至少需要三万至三万五千辆拖拉机和二万五千至三万辆载重汽车。我们要不断地提高拖拉机和载重汽车的产量，使今后四、五年内，完全满足上述的需要。此外，还将大量生产其他各种先进的农业机器供给农业部门。（掌声）到那时，脱谷、抽水等固定作业将完全实现机械化，搬运、翻耕、播种、收割等流动作业也将基本上实现机械化。
    在我国实现农业的机械化，不得不考虑到我国水稻生产占主要比重、土地起伏和斜度较大、有间作、造垅播种等固有的耕作体系和各地自然经济条件差别很大等情况，因之我们在实现机械化中应当坚持如下的原则：先从平地开始，逐渐扩大到山间地带；先从最吃力而费工最大的作业开始，逐渐过渡到综合性机械化；并且要使大机械和中小机械、现代化的机械化和简单的小机械化很好地相结合。
    直到现在，我国的农业合作社通过国营农业机器代耕站利用了现代化的农业机器。今后在一定时间内，我们仍将继续经营和扩大国营农业机器代耕站，来促进农业的机械化。同时在农业合作社的规模得到扩大、经济基础得到迅速加强的条件下，要使农业合作社也具备现代化的农业机器，以便建立使农业合作社全面过渡到自己具备并直接使用现代化农业机器的制度。这将更有利于改善农业机器的管理和利用，缩小行政管理费和非生产劳动力，提高农民的技术水平。
    为了保证农业机械化的顺利实现，农业合作社必须首先整理田地，兴修道路和桥梁，并要组织机械化作业班，使拖拉机、载重汽车便于通行和工作；同时要大力进行拖拉机手、载重汽车司机、调整员、修理工等技术人材的培养工作。
    农业机器的生产部门，随着拖拉机数量的增加，要大量生产适合各种拖拉机能力的各种拖带的机器和零件，并进一步提高质量。特别要迅速地完成我国农村最迫切需要的插秧机的研究工作，制造出适合我国农村的、既简便又结实和尽可能利用于多种作业的各种农业机器。
    朝鲜展开大建中小电站的全民性运动
    农村电气化的任务将在一两年内完成
    为了在农村顺利地实现水利化和机械化，必须先实行电气化。
    在农村不先实现电气化，就不能保证水利化和机械化的实现，也不能发展农村的文化。
    我国在农村电气化方面，已经取得了相当的成就。目前在我国，占整个农村里的67％、占总农户数的49％都已经用电。
    但是，为了农业的技术改造，我国还需要很多的电力。同时，我们要给所有的村庄和农户都安上电灯，装上有线广播器。要进行这些工作，必须迅速地增加电力生产。
    我们党早已明确地提出了我国电气化的基本方向。目前，我国正在建设秃鲁江、江界、云峰等大规模的水力发电站。今后仍将继续建设大规模的水力发电站，同时也要进行城市的火力发电站的建设。
    为了在一、两年内完成农村的电气化，在全国各地展开全民性的运动建立中、小型发电站，这是最重要的问题。因为中、小型发电站，不需要很大的投资就可以简易地、迅速地建立起来，同时由于各地都可以建立这种发电站，所以可以节省大量的电线及其他电气器材。
    在我国到处都有可以利用的水力和各种能建立发电站的资源。我国劳动者要实现电气化的劳动热情和创造性已达到了高潮，各地从去年9月起广泛地建立小型发电站。在咸镜南道已经建设一百六十五所，在慈江道建设一百六十三所，在江原道建设七十五所，这些道的每个里都用电。
    在电力生产方面，我们要破除神秘观点，应积极利用水力、火力、风力、潮汐等各种动力资源，更加大力地建立中、小规模的发电站。在农村中特别要把发电站建设和兴修农田水利工程结合起来，使所有的水库里的水，先利用于发电，然后再灌溉水田和旱田，不让一滴水白流出去。
    各电器厂要大量生产和供应中、小型发电站所需的发电机、变压器和电动机等。
    水利化、机械化、电气化，这是不可分割的统一的任务，是农村技术革命的总路线。
    在最近年间，我们要有效地完成这项巨大的任务，以生命水灌浇我国田野，并用现代化的机械和技术装备农业，保证每年丰收，并减轻农民的繁重的劳动，使农民的劳动省劲和愉快。（掌声如雷）
    以谷物生产为主同时发展农村的多种经济
    深耕密植大量施肥是提高产量的首要条件
    同志们：
    我们要积极推进农业的技术改造，并以它为基础保证农业生产的大跃进。
    过去我国农业处于落后状态，偏重于谷物生产，甚至连谷物生产中的问题也不能及时加以解决。今后我们要彻底肃清我国农业的这种落后性，保证农业经济的多种发展。
    我们要继续坚决地贯彻我们党关于以谷物生产为主同时发展经济作物、畜牧业、养蚕业、果木业、淡水养鱼等农业经济的政策，从而把我国农村不仅变为强有力的粮食基地，而且转变为强有力的原料基地。
    谷物问题是在社会主义建设中最重要的问题之一。如果不大力发展谷物生产，就不能供应居民足够的粮食，也不能进一步发展畜牧业等农业经济的其他部门。
    在土地面积有限的我国，增加谷物等农作物生产的关键在于：进一步发展集约经营，提高单位面积产量。
    恩格斯曾说：
    “人类所支配的生产力是无穷无尽的。应用资本、劳动和科学就可以使土地的收获量无限地提高。”
    我国耕地面积小，土地又很瘠薄。但是，只要我们能够改进农业技术，不断地发展集约农业，瘠薄的土地可以变为肥沃的土地，在小面积的土地上也可以无限地提高产量。
    农业的集约经营，是保证高产的关键。在这方面，我国农民已经积累了丰富的经验，获得了我们祖先根本不能想像的高产成绩。
    为了进一步提高单位面积产量，我们要继续发展集约农业，这是农业生产方面的我党的基本方针。
    同水利化和机械化一起，深耕、密植、大量施肥，是实现农业集约经营的基本方法，是提高单位面积产量的首要条件。
    根据农业科学研究部门试验的结果，深耕能够提高水稻町步单位面积产量，在深耕十五公分的水田中，比深耕十公分的水田增产23％，深耕二十公分增产27％；再看水稻密植和产量的关系：每坪密植二百四十株，比密植一百二十株的水田增产35％，每坪密植玉米十八棵，比密植十棵增产54％。
    去年在试验田里取得了高产纪录的各农业合作社的经验，也明确地证明深耕密植的优越性。
    正如党中央委员会在给全体党员的信中所指出，从今年开始，我们必须把水田和旱田深耕到三十公分以上，并且要提高栽植密度，使水稻每坪提高到三百株以上，玉米提高到十五棵以上，小麦每町步播种量要提高到三百公斤以上。
    争取高产的最重要条件是大量施肥。深耕密植也只有在大量施肥的条件下才能奏效。我们要坚决增加施肥量，并要根据土质和各种作物的需要，建立适当的科学的施肥体系，正确地保证各种肥料的施肥比例。
    各农业合作社必须在所有的耕地中每町步平均施自积肥料五十吨以上。为此，在全国范围内，每年要生产自积肥料一万万吨以上。各农业合作社要尽量挖掘厩肥、堆肥和泥炭等所有的肥源，开展日常的全民性的运动，来急速增加自积肥料产量。
    同时，还要多施化学肥料。国家将进一步发展化肥工业，向农村供应更多的化肥，以便在四、五年内，把町步施肥量提高到八百到一千公斤，特别将显著地提高目前还感不足的磷肥和钾肥的比重。各农业合作社也要办小型的化肥厂，大量生产磷肥、钾肥和石灰。
    此外，还要急速完成目前正在进行的一百万町步耕地的土壤调查工作，以便在这个基础上建立科学的施肥体系。
    在提高单位面积产量方面，播种优良种子，改善田间管理工作和防治病虫害等工作，具有重要的意义。
    每个农业合作社都要设立育种圃，进一步改进和加强育种工作，以便培育合乎当地气候、土壤等的高产的优良种子。要像经营园艺一样精心细意地经营耕田，并且要利用农药和一切可能的方法，来彻底防治农作物的病虫害。
    要全面地采用已经被经验所确证的丰产耕作法——冷床育苗法和棉花营养坛假植法，各农业科学研究部门和农业合作社，应进一步加强实验研究工作，以改进农业生产方法，特别要积极奖励和启发农民的热情和创造性。
    在发展农业技术和改善耕作方法等方面，展开反对保守思想的斗争，是具有决定性意义的。如果沿袭并固守从旧的封建时代相传下来的落后的耕作方法，那么农业就不可能发展，因之要展开反对一切保守思想的斗争，发扬创造性，要大胆地、积极地采用先进农业技术。
    这样，在农业科学方面，要掀起大革新，在单位面积产量方面，不断地创造新纪录。
    最近二、三年内谷物年产量将达七百万吨
    朝鲜全体人民所需的大米将获得充分供应
    我国农业合作社的全体社员，在最近二、三年内，要努力使水稻町步产量达到十吨至十五吨、玉米达到四至五吨、小麦达到三至四吨。这样，我们就毫无疑问地能完成年产七百万吨以上谷物的任务。
    到那时，我国完全以大米将供给全体劳动者，并且将奠定进一步发展畜牧业的巩固基础。这当然是艰巨的任务，但并不是遥远的将来的理想。
    只要我国全体农民遵照党的农业政策，胜利地实现改进农业技术和耕作方法的上述各项措施，这项战斗性的任务就会在最近几年内可以完成。（掌声如雷）
    同谷物的增产一起，要进一步增加经济作物和蔬菜的生产。
    在经济作物方面，要把重点放在棉花等纤维作物和各种油料作物的种植方面，还要种植更多的甜菜、烟、人参和蛇麻草等。
    今天对我们来说，解决纤维原料的问题是非常重要的问题。过去我国的纺织工业极其落后，纤维原料也不能自力解决。今天我国的纺织工业已提高到相当的水平，并且已经开始生产化学纤维，从而原料问题也逐渐可以自力解决。我国今后将进一步发展纺织工业，在四、五年内把布匹产量提高到五亿公尺。为了保证纺织工业所需的原料，不仅要迅速提高化学纤维的产量，还要迅速提高棉花等自然纤维的产量。
    最近经验证明，在我国可以大量生产自然纤维。
    在棉花的种植方面，我们要把町步产量提高到三吨至四吨以上，扩大棉花的播种面积，以便在两三年内使棉花产量增加到二十万吨以上。同时，要在两江道、慈江道和咸镜北道的山区广泛种植亚麻和大麻。
    为了给劳动人民充分供应食用油，各农业社要大力种植落花生、向日葵、芝麻、苏子、油菜等各种油料作物，争取在最近年内生产十万吨以上的食用油。此外，在今后数年内为了保证生产十万吨白糖，要把甜菜的栽培面积扩大到三万町步，并要提高它的单位面积产量。
    城市及工人区郊区的农业合作社，要扩大蔬菜基地，不断提高单位面积产量，以便给工人、职员正常地供应各种新鲜的蔬菜。
    迅速发展牧畜业是目前摆在农业部门面前的一个最重要的任务。
    自古以来，朝鲜人民对吃大米饭、喝肉汤、住瓦房的人家称为富户。现在我们为使全体劳动人民都能过富裕的生活而奋斗。我们不久就将充分地供应大米。现在主要的问题在于大量生产肉类供给居民。
    今天，劳动人民对肉类等畜产品的需要迅速增加起来了。我们要迅速发展畜牧业，来满足这种需要。
    最近，我们党讨论了关于迅速加强畜产物生产的问题，提出了一系列的具体任务。
    在今后两三年内，要生产四十万吨肉、四十六万吨牛奶、十五亿个鸡蛋、七百吨以上羊毛。
    为此，各农业合作社要更加迅速地发展畜产业，以集体畜产业为主，还要发展各农户的个体畜产业。
    农业合作社应该把重点放在繁殖率高又能圈养的猪的饲养方面，还要大量饲养牛、鸡、鸭等，以便把每一百町步肉类产量提高到二十五吨水平。
    为了提高牛奶产量，我们要从朝鲜牛挤奶，并且在两三年内，至少把三十万头朝鲜牛改为乳牛，把每头牛的挤奶量提高到一吨半至两吨以上。
    要继续巩固畜产业的基础，在两三年内大力繁殖家畜，牛要增为一百万头、猪增为四百万口、绵羊和山羊增为六十至七十万只。
    在发展畜牧业方面，最重要的问题是建立巩固的饲料基地。在最近几年内，我们要把麦类后作地中的二十万町步和坡地、瘠薄地十万町步改为饲料地，在放牧地、空闲地和山麓等地，广泛栽植各种牧草。家畜饲料必须以青贮饲料和干草为主。青贮饲料是所有家畜都爱吃、吃后又爱上膘的饲料，并且比别的饲料能显著地降低畜产物的成本。各农业合作社要大力生产青贮饲料。以麦类地后作物——带穗的鲜玉米秸，制造大量的配合青贮饲料，做为猪的饲料。
    饲养家蚕的成就和最近几年内在饲养柞蚕及蓖麻蚕的工作中所取得的成就，给蚕业的发展开辟了广阔的前途。
    我们不仅需要棉织品，还需要毛织品和丝织品。要增产丝织品，必须发展养蚕业。
    在今后两三年内，我们要把蚕茧的产量提高到六、七万吨。
    农业合作社要继续扩大桑田、柞蚕林和蓖麻的种植面积，广泛采用集体饲养、多次饲养等先进的饲养方法，不断地提高蚕茧的质量和单位产量。
    在我国各地，出产大量各种味美的水果。我们要在今后两、三年内扩大果木园十万町步，在今后十年内，要扩大到二十万町步。我们要在所有的丘陵地带和村庄栽满果木树，在公路两旁也要栽植果木树。这样，不仅能增产水果，而且还能更美化我国的国土。
    各农业合作社要广泛地采用先进果木管理法，增加施肥量，保证充分浇水，以便在今后几年内，把水果的町步产量提高到二十吨以上。
    各农业合作社要大力发展浅海养殖和淡水养鱼工作。展开这项工作，既能造成水产品资源，又能克服水产业的季节性的限制，保证安全而大量的生产，更圆满地满足对水产品的需要。
    我国具有大力发展浅海养殖和淡水养鱼工作的有利条件。在我国的东西海岸，有广阔的浅海和盐碱地，各地还有许多水库、湖沼和江河。在占整个耕地面积三分之一的水田里，也可以养鱼。我们要善于利用这种有利的自然条件，迅速发展养殖、养鱼工作，以便在今后两三年内，使这个部门水产品产量提高到三十至四十万吨。
    此外，我们还要养蜂，采山菜，摘山果，还进行食品加工生产。要发展各农业合作社根据自然经济条件可以发展的一切副业生产，继续贯彻我们党的“靠山吃山，靠海吃海”的口号。
    我们要这样多方面地发展农业，迅速提高农业合作社的收入，进一步巩固它的经济基础，使农民的生活富裕起来。
    我们不仅要大量生产谷物，还要大量生产各种农业产品和副业产品，把我国的农业转变成能够满足人民经济和居民多种需要的发达的社会主义经济。
    大力建筑农村住宅和文化福利等机构
    今后四五年内将使农村变得更加美丽
    各农业合作社在从各方面全面发展各种农业生产的同时，应把重要力量放在农村建设方面。
    我们党把建设新的文化农村当作一项重要的任务。我国的农业合作社大力展开了建设工作，已经取得了巨大的成就。
    但是，我们还没有完全改变由于数千年来的压迫、剥削和贫穷所造成的旧农村的面貌。
    各农业合作社的建设，必须以生产建设为主，并要大力建筑新的文化住宅，兴建更多的教育、文化、卫生和福利设备。
    我们必须努力地显著地提高建筑的质量。我们兴建的每座房屋和设备，必须适合于我国农民的社会主义幸福生活的需要。使他们使用起来感到方便，同时又要雅致、美观和坚固。
    国家今后仍将为农村建设继续供应必要的资材，并且给予农民以技术上的帮助。各农业合作社要在农村建设中广泛动员和利用地方资材，尽可能地自力解决建设资材。这将降低建设成本，并进一步加快建设速度。
    我们要合理地分布住宅和各种文化福利设备，兴修道路，栽植树木，要把我们的农村建设得更加美丽。
    这样，我们必须在今后四、五年内，使所有的农村完全改变成为社会主义的农村。（掌声如雷）
    文化革命是农村社会主义建设的现实要求
    今后几年内使全体社员具备初中程度知识
    同志们：
    今天摆在我国农村面前的重要的任务是文化革命。如果不进行文化革命，那末在农村中就不能进行技术革命，就不能巩固已经获得胜利的社会主义的生产关系。我们要积极地促进文化革命，使之适合于农村社会主义建设的现实要求。
    目前农村文化革命中的最重要的任务，是提高全体农民的一般知识水平和技术水平。
    我国已经从去年11月起开始实施了初中义务教育制，在四、五年内，将实施普遍的技术义务教育制。因此，我们的年青的一代都可以受到中等教育，今后还将可以全面地受到技术教育。国家还将进一步加强高等技术专科学校和大学培养农业专家及技术人员的工作。各级学校要使教育和生产密切地结合起来，把新的一代培养成为全面发展的、有才能的社会主义建设者。
    同时，要在今后几年内努力使全体农业合作社社员具备相等于人民学校或初中毕业程度以上的知识，并掌握一定程度的技术。为此，我们党提倡各农业合作社广泛开办劳动者学校和劳动者中学。根据党的这一方针，现在全国各地农业合作社，已广泛地建立了劳动者学校和劳动者中学，许多社员在这里进行学习。今后我们要进一步加强并发展这一工作。同时要广泛地吸收社员参加函授教育网，并使他们展开学习新技术的群众性运动。
    这样，全体农民将成为有知识的人，成为有技术、精通于农业生产的人。
    要提高知识和技术水平，同时还要使农民过文化的生活。
    现在我们生活在最先进的社会主义制度下。今天我国由落后的农业国家转变成为社会主义工业、农业国家。社会发展了，经济也发展了，因而人民也必须过文化的生活。
    我们要把我们的生活改变成为文化的生活，把它作为当前的重要工作，并以全民性运动加以进行。要消除一切不卫生的、不文化的现象，大胆地革新落后的生活方式和习惯。
    为了进一步改善和加强农村的保健卫生工作，必须完全消灭血吸虫病等水土病和传染病，彻底扑灭苍蝇、蚊子、臭虫、老鼠等。各农业合作社社员要把家庭和村庄收拾得更整洁、更美丽，把儿女养育得更好，把生活搞的更舒适、更文化。
    与此同时，我们要进一步改进民主宣传室的工作，使它成为农民学习和受教育和文化娱乐的场所，还要发展农村的体育、文学、艺术业余小组等群众性工作。
  大力对农民群众进行共产主义的思想教育
  以爱国主义和国际主义思想坚强武装农民
    为了从政治上更加巩固农业合作社，建设社会主义，并为了准备逐渐过渡到共产主义，要进一步加强对农民群众的共产主义的思想教育。
    在我国农村社会主义生产关系已经取得了胜利。但是我们农民还没有完全消除由旧社会继承下来的封建的和资本主义的思想残余。
    在农民群众中要大力展开共产主义思想教育工作，彻底肃清农民的各种旧思想残余，改造他们的思想。
    我们首先要使农民继续认清，在农村取得胜利的社会主义的农业合作化制度，比资本主义制度或小商品经济绝对优越，教育农民拥护这个制度，并坚决与企图使剥削制度复辟的分子进行斗争，从敌人的侵犯中坚决保卫住社会主义的胜利成果。
    在对农民进行共产主义教育方面，最重要的是肃清他们的思想中的利己主义和小商品所有者的劣根性。利己主义是阻挠我们前进的巨大的障碍。
    为了有效地建设社会主义，我们要巩固并进一步发展农村的社会主义所有制和集体所有制。并且为了将来建设共产主义，我们要把集体所有制逐步转变为全民所有制。要不肃清利己主义，就不可能促进这一切的发展过程。
    要教育全体农业合作社社员，使他们爱护公共财产，尊重国家和社会的利益，个人利益要服从国家和社会的利益；在集体生活中，要发挥同志式的互助合作精神。合作社的公共财产和集体经济，是发展合作社的基础，是提高社员们生活水平的根源。对贪污、浪费和盗窃公共财产、或不认真地参加集体经济工作的倾向，要坚决展开斗争。
    与此同时，要教育全体合作社社员热爱劳动。
    劳动是最崇高的事情，人类社会的一切财富都是通过劳动者的劳动创造出来的。
    今天，我国农民并不是为地主、资本家而劳动，而是为自己的幸福和国家社会的利益而劳动。在我国的制度下，劳动是最光荣的事，是所有的人的神圣义务。社会主义的原则是不劳者不得食。不爱劳动，好偷懒，靠别人过日子是最可耻的。我们要教育合作社社员们，使他们建立正确的劳动观点，热爱劳动，老实地参加集体劳动，自觉地遵守劳动纪律。
    我们要使农民以社会主义爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义思想坚强地武装起来。
    社会主义爱国主义，应该从热爱自己的合作社、热爱自己家乡出发。我国农民都应该成为热爱自己的家乡和社会主义祖国的热烈的爱国者。
    我们要进一步加强对农民的无产阶级国际主义思想教育，使他们从热爱自己的社会主义祖国出发，拥护社会主义阵营，加强与社会主义阵营各国人民以及全世界一切向往社会主义的劳动人民之间的友谊团结。
  （掌声如雷）
    为了保证有效地进行社会主义建设，要进一步巩固工农联盟。它是全体人民团结的基础，革命胜利的决定性的因素。在我国工农联盟经受了战争的艰苦考验，并通过社会主义革命，进入了新的发展阶段。
    在农村进行技术革命和文化革命中，我们要更加强工人阶级对农民的领导和帮助，进一步促进农业的发展和农民的思想改造，从而更加巩固工农联盟，更加提高工人阶级的领导作用。
    加强党和国家对合作社的领导和帮助
    发扬社内民主提高干部政治业务水平
    同志们：
    为了有效地执行农业部门的重大的任务，从政治经济上更加巩固集体经济，要改进农业合作社的经营管理工作，进一步加强党和国家对合作社的领导和帮助。
    鉴于农业合作化已经完成，原来的农业合作社已合并并走上了新的发展阶段，因而这个大会将通过新的农业合作社标准章程。
    新的农业合作社标准章程草案的基本内容，是使我国全体农业合作社的社员们，在工人阶级的领导下，进一步巩固在农村中所取得的社会主义胜利果实，完成社会主义建设，为逐渐过渡到共产主义做好准备。新的标准章程是我国农民争取土地和自由进行了长期斗争的结晶、是一面照亮他们集体生活准则的镜子；给他们指明更加光明前途的灯塔。
    我们要进一步改进农业合作社的经营管理工作，使合并后的农业合作社，遵照农业合作社新标准章程的基本原则，更好地完成摆在自己面前的重大任务。
    在社员数日益剧增和社的工作范围扩大的条件下，进一步发扬社内民主，是巩固合作社的关键。我们要广泛地吸收社员群众参加社的经营管理工作，使他们以合作社主人翁的态度毫无顾忌地提出意见，批评缺点，一致团结起来，在一切工作中发挥更大的积极性和创造性。同时要彻底整顿社管理干部中还存在着的官僚主义作风，使他们要建立革命的群众观点：依靠群众进行工作，向群众学习，并教育群众。要经常按期召开社员大会、代表会议和管理委员会，一切问题须通过集体讨论和决定，及时向社员报告社的工作和财产收支情况。
    正如我们的经验所证明：管理干部的政治业务水平，在巩固合作社方面具有重要的意义。通过并社工作，管理干部的队伍得到了进一步的加强，但是与庞大任务的要求相比，他们的水平还是低的。
    管理干部特别是各管理委员长，要不断地努力，不仅要精通一切农业生产组织和技术，还要力求掌握商品流通、信用、教育、文化、卫生等各部门的知识，了解社的内部生活。党和政府应继续加强管理干部的培养和再教育工作，继续帮助他们提高政治和业务水平。
    我国的农业合作社，是社会主义的大规模的经济。不消说，这种经济没有计划是不能经营的。特别是在目前所造成的新的情况下，计划化的意义，更为重大了。
    不仅在生产方面，而且在分配、交换以及消费等合作社的一切经济活动方面，都要实行计划化，教育、文化、卫生等工作，也要有计划地发展。各农业合作社特别是对基于科学基础的前景计划，也要加以深重的注意，以便展开庞大的自然改造工作和农业的技术改造，胜利地保证农村的建设工作，有计划地发展合作经济。
    各农业合作社制订生产和建设计划，必须保证最大限度地利用潜力和各种可能，用最少的劳动力、材料和资金，取得最大的成就。
    各农业合作社要认真地保持积累和消费之间的平衡，保证不断的扩大再生产，有计划地提高社员的生活水平。我们既要反对不照顾社员的当前生活，片面地强调进行可以从缓的建设的现象，又要反对不考虑集体经济的发展和社的经济基础，不管明天怎样，有多少吃多少的现象。
    我们的原则是既要考虑积累，又要考虑消费；随着社员生活的改善逐渐增加积累。只有增加积累，才能在巩固的基础上不断地提高社员的物质文化生活。
    为了完成农村的技术革命，进行农村庞大的生产建设、文化建设，要增加农业合作社的公积金。
    每个农业合作社要考虑自己社的具体情况，在标准章程所规定的范围内，决定每年的积累比例。
    公积金是增加社内公共财产的基本源泉。各农业合作社用公积金购买拖拉机、汽车等现代化机械，不断地增加生产，扩大生产和文化设备，并建筑住宅。
    今后评定合作社的工作成绩，不仅以社员的收入多寡为根据，而且还要以积累公积金的多寡和基本建设的规模做根据。
    要严格管理随着公积金的增多而增加的公共财产，使之更合理地利用于发展集体经济和增进社员福利等方面。
    改善劳动组织和合理地利用劳动力，是今天农业合作社的特别重要问题。
    每个农业合作社要适应新的具体情况，合理地改编作业班，更加提高全体社员参加集体劳动的比例。
    要彻底消除经常变动工作场所，不及时准备作业条件，不及时下达工作指示因而浪费劳动力的现象。
    同时，要大力展开组与组、班与班、社与社之间的社会主义竞赛运动，广泛地推广优秀的成就和经验，努力在经济及文化建设方面不断地掀起新的革新。
    各农业合作社要深切地关心社员的日常生活。
    要防止随着社员收入的迅速增加而可能产生的浪费现象，要指导他们妥善地安排自己的生活。我们还要关心社员的劳动保护条件，保证所有社员能有一定的时间休息和睡眠。特别要减轻妇女的家庭负担，创造保护儿童和更好地养育儿童的条件。为此，要办好托儿所、幼儿园、洗衣房、缝纫所等，并在农忙期开设公共食堂。
    在农业合作化完成和合作社规模得到扩大的情况下，要加强党和国家对合作社的指导和帮助。
    从今年起，我们计划把农业现物税比例由过去平年产量的10％到27％降低到12％的程度。（掌声）并计划完全免除山区的部分经济基础比较薄弱的农业合作社的现物税。（掌声）
    在农产品的产量逐年急剧增加的今天，这样大大降低现物税率，将给农业合作社带来巨大的经济上的利益，促使合作社显著地增加积累，进一步加快农业的技术改造和农村建设，还大大地有助于落后的合作社的经济基础的巩固，更加提高农民的生活水平。
    在保证农业发展、巩固集体经济中，我们要进一步提高各级党组织、政权机关和农业经济领导干部的作用。最近我们党采取了关于加强道、市、郡人民委员会领导农村的力量和扩大它们的权限的一系列措施。这在使领导接近于生产、适合于新的农村现实、发挥地方的创造性、挖掘生产潜力和可能性等方面，具有巨大的意义。
    我们要在农村领导工作中消除形式主义作风，加强现场领导，特别要对经济基础还薄弱的农业合作社集中领导力量，使这些合作社迅速地发展起来。
    全体农业领导干部，要把领导和群众的革命热情结合起来，进一步加强党和群众的统一，从而彻底贯彻我们党的农业政策。
    为了保证党对农村工作的领导，特别要加强农业合作社的党组织的工作。
    农业合作社的党组织要深入广大群众，宣传和贯彻党的路线和政策，动员他们积极贯彻党的政策，并且在这个过程中提高党员的先锋队作用。
    在好几个村庄和党组织合并到一个社的情况下，要克服过去狭隘的本位主义和家族主义倾向，进一步加强社员的思想统一和互助合作。
    党组织要加强对农业合作社的管理经营工作和经济活动的领导和监督。
    党组织要加强和社内的爱国烈属和军属的工作，经常关怀他们的生活和他们子弟的教育，并从各方面帮助他们，使他们在社的工作中起核心作用。
    党组织要很好地关心民青同盟等群众团体的工作。
    在我国的社会主义建设中，党的后备队——民青盟员们，担负着突击队的任务。
    党组织要正确地领导民青组织，加强对青年的共产主义教育，不断提高他们的技术文化水平，让他们作为祖国和人民的勇敢战士，尽自己的一切智慧和革命热情，为农村的社会主义建设而服务。
    我们要把所有的农业合作社发展成为经济基础坚固、社员生活富裕、政治上坚定的社会主义经济。只有这样才可以铜墙铁壁般地巩固我们党的农村阵地。
    美李匪帮统治下的南朝鲜已成为饥饿地带
    北部社会主义建设是朝鲜和平统一的保证
    同志们：
    我们祖国被分裂为南北两半部，在共和国北半部正在进行的社会主义建设和南朝鲜经济情况呈现着截然不同的对照。今天南朝鲜经济越来越陷入破产的境地。
    美李匪帮十三年来统治南朝鲜的结果，剩下的只是民族经济的破产，人民生活的贫穷、无知、蒙昧和堕落。
    南朝鲜工厂企业中的大部分是中小企业，其中约有80％停工或缩短生产时间。
    目前，在南朝鲜有四百二十万以上的失业者流浪在街头，侥幸有工作的工人，也只能领到相当于最低生活费三分之一的工资，并且经常拖欠好几个月。
    我国社会主义农业合作化经济正在继续飞跃发展，但南朝鲜农业迄今没有摆脱殖民地半封建的附属地位，生产力日益遭到严重的破坏。
    南朝鲜播种面积较日本帝国主义统治时期减少了六十万町步；谷物总产量减少了40％。在日寇统治朝鲜的时期，南朝鲜的谷物产量相当于北朝鲜的两倍，但是现在，南朝鲜的谷物产量却比共和国北半部显著地减少了。
    以“朝鲜的谷仓”闻名的南朝鲜，已经变为慢性的饥饿地带，约有占总农户半数的农户陷于断粮境地。
    南朝鲜农民中的绝大多数，已经沦为没有一坪土地的佃农或雇农，或者沦为离井背乡、乞食仿徨的流浪民。
    虽然如此，但是美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮，却把总预算的约70％做为军事费和警察费，丝毫不关心农业经济的恢复。他们不择手段地榨取骨瘦如柴的南朝鲜农民的最后一滴血汗。
    这是美帝国主义者在南朝鲜施行殖民政策的必然结果。
    南朝鲜人民唯一的出路是：摆脱美国侵略者的统治，实现祖国的统一。
  南朝鲜农民进一步认清了，在美李匪帮的统治下，是不可能得到土地和自由的；也是不可能摆脱今天这样的难以形容的悲惨处境的。
    我国农村的社会主义建设成就越大、我们农民的生活水平提得越高，就越能鼓舞起呻吟在压迫剥削和饥寒交迫苦痛生活中的南朝鲜农民的勇气和希望。（掌声）
    我们共和国北半部的农民为了拯救南朝鲜的同胞，要更加发展农业经济，更好地建设社会主义。
    共和国北半部的社会主义建设，将成为实现祖国和平统一的坚强的保证，并将成为祖国统一后迅速恢复南朝鲜经济，改善南朝鲜人民生活的强有力的物质基础。
    随着时间的增加，共和国北半部的社会主义力量将更加增强，南朝鲜人民的革命觉悟将更加提高。任何力量也不可能阻挠朝鲜人民向往祖国和民族统一的革命力量的成长。（掌声如雷）
    在统一的祖国疆土上，全国同胞聚集在一起，过自由、富裕和幸福日子必将到来。（雷鸣般的掌声经久不息）
    社会主义在世界范围内取得了决定性胜利
    形势发展有利于朝鲜人民完成伟大的事业
    今天，社会主义在世界范围内取得了决定性的胜利，帝国主义势力正走向没落的道路。
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营比帝国主义阵营无比的强大。
    社会主义阵营占有整个地球陆地面积的四分之一以上的广阔土地，具有着比帝国主义国家多一倍的将近十万万的人口。
    伟大的苏联在经济和科学技术方面取得了惊人的巨大成就，开始压倒美国。
    即将召开的苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会，将讨论新的、国民经济七年计划，这不仅是苏联人民建设共产主义的宏伟纲领，而且更加鼓舞全世界人民为和平和社会主义的斗争。（掌声如雷）
    苏联已经发射了三颗人造卫星，开辟了科学发展历史上的新的纪元。（掌声）
    在新年年初，苏联向月球发射了宇宙火箭。（雷鸣般的掌声经久不息）这清楚地说明：苏联的科学和技术站在人类科学文化的最前列，远远超过了以美国为首的资本主义世界，开辟着人类从未知道的世界，为人类做出伟大的贡献。（掌声）
    苏联发射宇宙火箭，显示了社会主义比资本主义的优越性，并使全世界进步人类进一步坚定对共产主义未来的信心。（掌声如雷）
    我以大会和全体朝鲜人民的名义，热烈地祝贺苏联科学家、技术人员、工人和全苏联人民的伟大成就。（全场起立，雷鸣般的掌声和欢呼声经久不息）
    所有的人民民主国家，正在有效地建设着社会主义，人民经济得到迅速发展，人民生活得到不断的改善。
    目前，社会主义阵营国家的工业生产，占全世界工业生产的三分之一，在今后七年内，它将占全世界工业生产的一半以上。
    社会主义阵营国家，在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下，以苏联为中心更加巩固地团结起来了。
    所有这一切，都显示着压倒帝国主义势力的社会主义阵营的不可战胜的威力。（掌声如雷）
    一切形势的发展都更加有利于我们正义的伟大事业的完成。
    我国人民同一切兄弟国家人民一起并肩前进，将胜利地完成我国的社会主义建设，并且必将实现我们祖国的和平统一。（雷鸣般的掌声经久不息）
    这样，我国人民将在为进一步巩固远东和全世界和平与社会主义阵营的事业中作出贡献。
    同工人阶级一起，我国农民是这一光荣的伟大事业的承担者。
    我们农民为进一步发展农业的劳动斗争，同时就是为在共和国北半部建设社会主义的斗争，也就是为祖国的和平统一和将来繁荣的斗争。
    我确信，我国全体农民更加巩固地团结在我们党的周围，并在党的领导下，必将胜利完成摆在农业部门面前的巨大任务。（全场起立，震撼场内的雷鸣般的掌声和“朝鲜劳动党万岁！”、“金日成元帅万岁！的欢呼声经久不息）　（文内插题是本报编者所加）
