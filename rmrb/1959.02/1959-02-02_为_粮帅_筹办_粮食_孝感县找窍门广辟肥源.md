Procuring "Grain" for the "Grain Commander"
Xiaogan County Finds Ways to Broaden Fertilizer Sources

(本报讯) This newspaper reports that Xiaogan, a nationally renowned high-yield county for grain crops, is simultaneously carrying out three major tasks in winter agricultural production: vigorously accumulating and producing fertilizer, intensifying field management, and deeply plowing early rice fields. This is all in preparation for creating even higher grain production records this year.

A professional fertilizer accumulation team of over 75,000 people across the county, along with nearly 4,000 soil fertilizer workers, are working with great enthusiasm to procure "grain" for the "Grain Commander." From November of last year to the present, the county has already accumulated 290 million dan of various natural fertilizers, an increase of more than 40 million dan compared to the same period last year. It has also produced 1.33 million dan of various soil fertilizers. In order to broaden fertilizer sources and find more ways, the county has proposed six "want fertilizers" from nature: "Want fertilizer" from grass—composting various weeds and crop stalks, using high-temperature methods to accelerate decomposition; "Want fertilizer" from soil—combining the construction of new villages and sanitation work, demolishing old houses, and thoroughly sweeping and digging up old wall soil and topsoil; "Want fertilizer" from water—requiring all canteens and farm households to utilize all sewage; "Want fertilizer" from humans and livestock; "Want fertilizer" from air and stones—producing soil ammonia water, bacterial fertilizers, and various mineral fertilizers. Various locations have also achieved five integrations in fertilizer accumulation: the integration of natural fertilizer and soil fertilizer, the integration of eliminating crop pests and diseases and clearing field weeds, the integration of fertilizer accumulation and pig raising development, the integration of fertilizer accumulation and improving living environments, and the integration of concentrated fertilizer accumulation and regular fertilizer accumulation. These concrete measures have powerfully promoted the upsurge in the fertilizer accumulation movement. For example, Zhu Dian Commune, by implementing the "Six Wants for Fertilizer, Five Integrations" method among its members, accumulated more than 70 million dan of fertilizer in six days.

Field management of winter-sown crops across the county is also in full swing. In the fields, people carrying fertilizer, weeding, clearing ditches, and eliminating pests are shuttling back and forth, and the seedlings are growing green and lush. According to recent statistics, all 550,000 mu of winter-sown crops in the county have been top-dressed once, and 50% of the fields have been top-dressed twice. First- and second-class seedlings now account for more than 80% of the total sown area.

Why can Xiaogan County conduct winter production so vigorously? First, the county party committee and commune party committees implemented a division of labor and designated areas, with each level assuming responsibility. They went deep into the villages and fields, promptly summarized typical experiences, convened battlefield meetings, and organized inspections and evaluations, rapidly promoting the production upsurge from points to a widespread scale. Second, more than 500 of the original township and agricultural cooperative leaders who had been transferred up after communization were returned to their original positions, greatly strengthening the grassroots leadership of each commune. Third, each commune conducted comprehensive planning and arrangements for industrial and agricultural production, and also made reasonable adjustments to the use of labor. Fourth, the entire county seriously summarized the achievements and experiences of the 1958 Great Leap Forward in production from the bottom up, conducted commendations and model recognitions at all levels, and established the firm confidence of the vast number of cadres and masses in striving for a greater leap forward in production this year. Fifth, the party consolidation work of each commune has been closely integrated with current production, further inspiring the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members, and further setting off a new upsurge in the mass-based winter agricultural production challenge competition.

    为“粮帅”筹办“粮食”
    孝感县找窍门广辟肥源
    本报讯　全国著名的粮食作物高产县孝感，在冬季农业生产中三套锣鼓一齐打，大搞积肥造肥，大搞田间管理，大搞早稻田深翻，为今年粮食生产创造更高纪录做好准备。
    全县一支七万五千多人的积肥专业队伍，和近四千名制土化肥工人，正在干劲冲天地为“粮帅”筹办“粮食”。去年11月到目前，全县已积各种自然肥料二亿九千万担，比去年同期的积肥量增加四千多万担；造各种土化肥一百三十三万担。全县为了广辟肥源、多找窍门，向大自然提出了六要肥：向草要肥——沤制各种杂草和作物秆，用高温法加速腐熟；向土要肥——结合建新村和清洁卫生工作，拆旧屋和把陈壁土、地皮土等，扫净挖尽；向水要肥——要求所有食堂和农家把一切污水都加以利用；向人畜要肥；向空气、向石头要肥——制造土氨水、细菌肥料和各种矿物肥料等。各地积肥中还做到了五结合：即自然肥与土化肥结合，消灭作物病虫害与清除田间杂草结合，积肥与发展生猪结合，积肥与改善居住环境结合，突击性积肥与经常性积肥结合。这些具体的措施，有力地推动了积肥运动高潮。如祝店公社在广大社员中贯彻“六要肥、五结合”的办法，六天内积了七千多万担肥料。
    全县冬播作物田间管理工作，也是热火朝天。田野里挑担子送肥的，锄草的，清沟的，除虫的，人们往来如穿梭，禾苗长的青又青。据最近统计，全县五十五万亩冬播作物，全部追过一道肥，并有50％的田追过两道肥，一类、二类苗已占总播种面积80％以上。
    孝感县冬季生产为什么能搞得这样热热闹闹？首先，县委和公社党委实行了分工分片、层层包干，深入农村和田间，及时总结典型经验，召开战地会和组织检查评比，迅速地推动生产高潮由点到面广泛开展。其次，将公社化后调上来的原乡和农业社的主要干部五百多人，仍放回他们原先的工作岗位，大大充实了各公社的基层领导力量。三、各个公社对工农业生产进行了全面的规划和安排，对劳动力的使用也作了合理的调整。四、全县曾自下而上地认真总结了1958年生产大跃进的成绩和经验，层层进行评功表模，树立了广大干部和群众争取今年生产更大跃进的坚定信心。五、各公社的整社整党工作，紧密地结合了当前生产，更加鼓舞了广大社员群众的生产积极性，进一步掀起了群众性的冬季农业生产挑战竞赛的新高潮。　（曲一凡、胡烈斌）
