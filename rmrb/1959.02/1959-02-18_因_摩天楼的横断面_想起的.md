Thoughts on "Cross-section of a Skyscraper"
    Dong Rongsen

    It was in 1925. The poet Mayakovsky came to the United States from the newly born Soviet Russia and wrote a short poem entitled "Cross-section of a Skyscraper," offering a scathing satire of the decadent bourgeois "civilization." The poem says: "A poor, sour painter who paints nudes, closes his eyes slightly on the ninety-somethingth floor, thinking about how to curry favor with the boss's daughter, so that the boss will buy his oil paintings at a high price." With just a few light strokes, he made a highly artistic summary of the yellow and black culture in bourgeois society! The last four lines of this poem are—
        I trekked
            seven thousand versts,
        to a place that
                regressed seven years!

It seems that Mayakovsky was too polite. This world full of ghosts has regressed far more than "seven years"! The "Hula Hoop Dance" currently popular in the gold-worshipping empire is evidence of this.

    I don't know which loyal servant of a toy capitalist came up with the idea of making hoops out of plastic, letting people put them around their waists, and then using the posture of the Hawaiian Hula dance (that is, the grass skirt dance commonly seen in Hollywood movies) to frantically twist their waists and hips to prevent the hoop from falling to the ground. Some say that the "Hula Hoop" was originally a simple form of exercise and not as evil as the now-popular "Hula Hoop Dance," but in any case, as long as the bosses see that it can make money, they can also change its nature. For example, as soon as the "Hula Hoop Dance" became popular, medical doctors or health experts hired by capitalists were ordered to come out and declare that anyone who dances the hula hoop can reduce excess fat, that is, make fat people thinner, and so on. Under the capitalist's "propaganda offensive," in the world that Mayakovsky called "regressed seven years," first the lords, ladies, young masters, and young ladies who were full all day long and had nothing to do, and thus became fat, and then the petty citizens who were deceived, anesthetized, and insulted, started to jump and jump wildly. In a few months, you could see women on the streets wearing swimsuits and dancing this dance. The result is not difficult to imagine: it is said that a toy company in the United States is already unable to meet demand, the bosses are making a lot of money, the lords and young masters are enjoying themselves, and the souls of those who have been deceived and humiliated have once again suffered unparalleled blows....

    And this is just "dancing." According to the New York Post, London finds even "dancing" not "civilized" enough, and many clubs here have gone even further, having already implemented "nude competitions."

    This is the "civilization" of the Western bourgeoisie! "Equality between men and women" in name, but actually an insult to women; and from playing with insults to slave trading—alas, how many years has this regressed?

    因“摩天楼的横断面”想起的……
    栋榕森
    那是1925年的事了。诗人玛耶可夫斯基从新生的苏维埃俄罗斯到了美国，写了一首不长的诗篇，题目叫做“摩天楼的横断面”，对腐朽的资产阶级“文明”，作了辛辣的讽刺。诗中有云：“一个画裸体画的穷酸画家，在九十几层楼里微闭着眼睛，想着一桩心事，怎样去巴结老板的女儿，好让老板高价收买他的油画。”就像这么轻轻几笔，把资产阶级社会中的黄色文化和黑色文化作了高度的艺术的概括！这首诗的最后四句是——
        我跋涉了
            七千俄里，
        来到的地方
                却倒退了七年！看来，玛耶可夫斯基说得太客气了。这个充满鬼魂的世界，何止“倒退了七年”？近来流行在金元帝国里的“呼拉圈舞”，就是证据。
    不知是哪一位玩具资本家的忠仆，想出了用塑料制成圈子，让人们套在腰部，然后用夏威夷呼拉呼拉舞（也就是人们在好莱坞电影里所常见的草裙舞）的姿态，疯狂地扭动着腰部和臀部，使这圈子不能落地。也有人说“呼拉圈”最初确是一种简易的运动形式，并非像现在流行的“呼拉圈舞”一样的邪恶，但不管怎样，只要老板们看中它可以生财，也是可以让它改变性质的。例如“呼拉圈舞”刚刚流行，资本家雇用的医学博士或健康学家之类接着就奉命出来声明：凡是跳呼拉圈舞者，可以使脂肪过多的减少脂肪，亦即可使胖子变瘦云云。在资本家的“宣传攻势”下，于是乎在那个被玛耶可夫斯基称之为“倒退了七年”的世界里，起初是饱食终日无所用心因而发胖了的老爷太太公子小姐等等，后来是被欺骗、被麻醉和被侮辱的小市民们大跳而特跳起来，不出几个月，就在街上看见穿了游泳衣在跳这种舞的女性了。结果是不难想像的：据说美国一家玩具公司已经供不应求，老板们大赚其钱，老爷少爷们大享其乐，而被欺骗与被屈辱者的灵魂又一次遭受到无比的打击了……。
    而这还只是“舞”。据纽约邮报说，伦敦已经连“舞”也嫌不够“文明”了，这儿许多俱乐部走得更远些，早已实行“裸体比赛”了。
    这就是西方资产阶级的“文明”！字面上的“男女平权”，实际上对女性的侮辱；又从玩弄侮辱到奴隶买卖——唉，这究竟倒退了多少年？
