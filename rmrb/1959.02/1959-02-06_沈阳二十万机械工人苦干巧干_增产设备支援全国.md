    Shenyang's 200,000 Mechanical Workers Work Hard and Skillfully
    Increase Equipment Production to Support the Whole Country
    (Our newspaper's Shenyang dispatch, 5th) The more than 200,000 mechanical industry workers in Shenyang are currently advancing vigorously with soaring enthusiasm.
    Since the beginning of February, various factories have been actively arranging their February plans, and the broad masses of workers have put forward guarantees: "Don't slack off before or after the Spring Festival, and strive for a complete success in February." The Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory, whose actual output in January exceeded twice that of the same period last year, in order to ensure that the entire factory completes its February plan, the workers of the Third Workshop, responsible for supplying the entire factory with forgings, discussed the entire month's task in advance. They decided to seize the six days before the Spring Festival, work hard and vigorously, so that each piece of equipment would complete about 29% of the entire month's task for February. The workers of the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory, who completed the January state plan three days ahead of schedule, discussed the February plan on the 31st. Although February includes the Spring Festival holiday, with only about twenty working days in the month, the February production plan has been increased by 8% compared to January. They are now urgently manufacturing a batch of coal washing machines to support national steel production.
    While arranging the February plan, many factories are focusing on concrete measures to ensure that the measures keep up from the very beginning of February. The workers of the Shenyang Transformer Factory, who are manufacturing complete sets of power station equipment for power stations in Changchun, Harbin, Fushun and other places, after overfulfilling the January transformer output plan, have now decided to produce 2.95 million kilovolt-amperes of transformers in the first quarter, an increase of more than two times compared to the same period last year. In order to ensure the completion of this arduous production task, Wang Feng'en, an engineer promoted from worker in the Great Leap Forward last year, has mobilized more than 300 workers to formulate specific measures and conscientiously implement them.
    Although the Northeast region is still freezing cold, the various factories are already bustling with activity and full of the spirit of spring. The broad masses of workers are fighting tensely to produce more and better mechanical equipment to support all parts of the country.

    沈阳二十万机械工人苦干巧干
    增产设备支援全国
    本报沈阳5日电　沈阳市二十多万机械工业职工，目前正以冲天的干劲朝气勃勃地向前猛进。
    进入2月份以来，各个工厂都在积极安排2月份的计划，广大职工纷纷提出保证：“春节前后不松劲，力争2月满堂红”。1月份实际产量超过去年同期两倍左右的沈阳重型机器厂，为了保证全厂完成2月份计划，负责供应全厂锻件的第三车间职工提前讨论了全月的任务。他们决定抓紧春节前六天的时间，苦干猛干，使每台设备分别完成2月份全月任务的29％左右。提前三天完成了1月份国家计划的沈阳矿山机器厂职工，在31日就讨论了2月份的计划。虽然2月份正值春节假期，全月工作日只有二十来天，但2月份的产量计划反比1月份增加了8％。现在正在紧急制造一批洗煤机，支援全国钢铁生产。
    在安排2月份计划的同时，许多工厂都在大抓具体措施，保证2月份一开始就让措施跟上去。正为长春、哈尔滨、抚顺等地电站制造电站配套设备的沈阳变压器厂职工，在超额完成了1月份变压器产量计划之后，现又决定要在第一季度生产出二百九十五万千伏安的变压器，这一产量比去年同期增长了两倍多。为了保证完成这一繁重的生产任务，在去年大跃进中由工人提拔为工程师的王凤恩，已经发动了三百多工人一面制订具体措施，一面认真贯彻执行。
    尽管东北地区目前仍然天寒地冻，但各个工厂却已热气腾腾，充满了春意。广大职工正为生产出更多更好的机械设备支援全国各地而紧张战斗着。
