    Clumsy Wordplay
    Recently, when Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party negotiated with the Socialist Party on the issue of passing a resolution on Japan's non-nuclear armament in the Diet, it solemnly stated that it could write in the resolution that Japan "does not possess nuclear weapons that threaten other countries." But at the same time, it hurriedly declared that, for "defense," it could possess "non-threatening" nuclear weapons.
    Obviously, the Liberal Democratic Party thinks this word game is very clever. However, the ambition of the Kishi Nobusuke group to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," import American nuclear weapons, and accelerate the revival of militarism has long been exposed. Therefore, the so-called "non-threatening" nuclear weapons, like the U.S. imperialists' so-called "clean hydrogen bombs," cannot deceive anyone.

    拙劣的文字游戏
    最近，日本执政的自由民主党在和社会党谈判在国会通过有关日本非核武装决议的问题时，颇为郑重其事地表示可以在决议案中写明日本“不保有威胁别国的核武器”。但同时，它又慌忙声言：为了“防卫”，可以保有“不威胁别国的”核武器。
    显然，自由民主党认为他们这种文字游戏是很聪明的。然而，岸信介集团想通过修改日美“安全条约”，运进美国核武器，加紧复活军国主义的野心，早已暴露无遗。因此，所谓“不威胁别国”的核武器，同美帝国主义所谓“干净的氢弹”的说法一样，是欺骗不了任何人的。
