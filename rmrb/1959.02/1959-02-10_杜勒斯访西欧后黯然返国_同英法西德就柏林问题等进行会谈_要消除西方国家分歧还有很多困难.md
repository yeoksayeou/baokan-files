(Comprehensive report from this newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles visited Britain, France, and West Germany from February 4 to 8. This visit mainly discussed the German problem, the Berlin problem, and how to deal with Soviet proposals. Dulles departed from Bonn on the afternoon of the 8th and flew back to Washington.

The reason for Dulles' sudden "lightning trip," which Western European political figures found "unexpected," was that serious differences had arisen among Western countries in terms of strategies and methods on the Berlin issue, the German issue, and negotiations with the Soviet Union. West German newspapers bluntly pointed out that Dulles would only make such a surprise visit and talks in the event of a "major political crisis." Dulles himself admitted in a statement issued on February 3 when he left Washington that the current situation was "very complex" and required "joint consideration of our future course of action" with Britain, France, and West Germany.

Dulles arrived in London at noon on the 4th. Upon arriving at London Airport, he emphasized that "Western countries should understand each other." However, his visit to London was overshadowed by Macmillan's decision to visit the Soviet Union soon to hold direct talks with Soviet leaders on world issues, including issues related to Germany and European security.

Dulles concluded his two days of talks with Macmillan and Lloyd on the afternoon of the 5th. A British government spokesman said that "the European situation related to the German problem and the Berlin problem, as well as the prospects for the Geneva conference on the cessation of nuclear weapon testing," were "the basis of the talks." In addition, the two sides also discussed disarmament issues and "briefly exchanged views" on the situation in the Middle East.

Dulles arrived in Paris from London on the 5th and held talks with French President de Gaulle on the 6th in Paris. French Prime Minister Debré also participated in the talks.

After the talks, both French and American spokesmen emphasized that the two sides were "in agreement" on the German issue and the Berlin issue and that there were "no fundamental differences of opinion." However, they pointed out that the talks were merely "an exchange of views" and that "no proposals were made and no documents were drafted."

Dulles held two days of talks with Adenauer in Bonn. Judging from the published news about the talks, there are still many difficulties in reaching a consensus between Bonn and Washington on how to deal with Soviet proposals regarding the Berlin issue and the German peace treaty issue.

On the afternoon of the 7th and the morning of the 8th, the two sides held two talks lasting two to three hours each. After the talks, spokesmen for both sides emphasized that there were no differences of opinion on the handling of the German issue and the Berlin issue in terms of "some general views" or "principles." However, they both avoided revealing specific details of the talks, especially on issues such as what measures should be taken in West Berlin, "free elections," and the Western so-called "flexible policy."

An American spokesman said that in Dulles' talks with his "friends" in London, Paris, and Bonn, "no one fundamentally changed their attitude."

A Bonn government spokesman emphasized the need for more consultations between Western countries.

Regarding the Berlin issue, spokesmen for both sides confirmed that the talks had addressed the issue of what measures the West would take when the Soviet Union transferred the right to inspect access to West Berlin to the German Democratic Republic, but neither side revealed specific details.

According to an American spokesman, the West's response to the Soviet Union's January 10 proposal will be submitted within seven to ten days. However, according to Eckardt, Western countries will not publish their proposals before the East-West conference is held. Western claims should be put forward and discussed among responsible national leaders and diplomats. Eckardt also emphasized that in the future, the West will have such a slogan, "Never concede without concessions from the other side!" This shows that the Bonn government hopes that the West will continue to adopt a "tough" attitude towards the Soviet Union.

### 杜勒斯访西欧后黯然返国  同英法西德就柏林问题等进行会谈  要消除西方国家分歧还有很多困难

    杜勒斯访西欧后黯然返国
    同英法西德就柏林问题等进行会谈
    要消除西方国家分歧还有很多困难
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国国务卿杜勒斯于2月4日至8日先后访问了英国、法国和西德。这次访问主要是讨论德国问题、柏林问题以及如何应付苏联建议的问题。杜勒斯已于8日下午从波恩动身飞回华盛顿。
    杜勒斯突然作这次使西欧政界人士感到“意外”的“闪电旅行”的原因是，西方各国在柏林问题、德国问题以及同苏联谈判的问题上产生了策略、方法上的严重分歧。西德报纸直率地指出，只有在发生“重大的政治危机”时，杜勒斯才会作这种突击式的访问会谈。杜勒斯自己在3日离开华盛顿时发表的声明里承认，目前局势“非常复杂”，需要同英、法、西德“一道考虑我们今后的行动计划”。
    杜勒斯于4日中午到达伦敦。他在到达伦敦机场时强调“西方国家应当互相了解”。但他到伦敦的访问，由于麦克米伦决定即将访问苏联，同苏联领导人直接会谈世界问题，其中包括有关德国和欧洲安全的问题，而黯然失色。
    杜勒斯在5日下午结束了同麦克米伦和劳埃德的两天的会谈。英国政府发言人说，在这次会谈中，“同德国问题和柏林问题有关的欧洲局势问题，以及日内瓦不继续试验核武器会议的前景”是“会谈的基础”。此外，双方还讨论了裁军问题，并就中东形势“简短地交换了意见”。
    杜勒斯在5日从伦敦来到巴黎，6日在巴黎同法国总统戴高乐进行了会谈，法国总理德勃雷也参加了这次会谈。
    在会谈结束后，法、美两国发言人都强调，双方在德国问题和柏林问题上“意见一致”，“没有根本的意见分歧”，但是，他们指出，会谈只是“口头交换意见”性质，“没有提出任何建议，也没有拟定任何文件”。
    杜勒斯在波恩同阿登纳进行了两天会谈，从发表的关于会谈的消息看来，波恩和华盛顿之间要在如何对待苏联关于柏林问题和对德和约问题建议方面取得一致意见，还有着很多困难。
    在7日下午和8日上午，双方进行了两次历时两三小时的会谈。会谈后，双方的发言人都强调说，双方对德国问题和柏林问题的处理在“一些总的看法”或“原则”上没有意见分歧。但是他们都回避透露会谈的具体细节，特别是在关于要对西柏林采取什么措施、“自由选举”以及西方所谓“有弹性的政策”等问题上。
    美国发言人说，在杜勒斯同他在伦敦、巴黎、波恩的“朋友”的会谈中，“没有任何人在根本上改变自己的态度”。
    波恩政府发言人强调地谈到西方国家之间需要更多的磋商。
    关于柏林问题，双方发言人都证实，在会谈中已经谈到了当苏联把通向西柏林的检查权移交给德意志民主共和国时，西方将会采取什么措施的问题，但是双方都没有透露具体内容。
    据美国发言人透露，西方对苏联1月10日的建议的答复将在七天到十天之内提出。但是据埃卡特说，在东西方会议举行前，西方国家将不发表它们的建议，西方的主张应当在负责的国家领导人和外交人士中提出和讨论。埃卡特还强调表示，将来西方会有这样的口号，“没有对方的让步，就绝不让步！”这表明波恩政府希望西方继续对苏联采取“强硬”态度。
