    Strive to Exceed 100 Million Dan

    The National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Units, in its Ten Initiatives, proposed that the national cotton production target for this year is 100 million dan of ginned cotton, and efforts should be made to exceed it!

    Now that the spring is warm and the ice is melting, the cotton planting season is approaching. Cotton is a highly technical crop, and grasping every production link is crucial for completing this year's leap forward targets. At present, we should focus on the spring sowing stage. There are two main aspects to doing a good job in spring sowing: one is timely sowing, without missing the season; the other is to improve the quality of sowing (especially applying sufficient base fertilizer), striving for perfection.

    Party and government leading departments in all cotton-producing areas should fully utilize the experience from last year's Great Leap Forward, organize an inspection of spring sowing preparation work, strengthen leadership wherever preparation work is weak, and ensure that the preparation work of every commune and team is "ready for anything" before cotton sowing.

    This year, the national cotton planting area will be expanded, and some areas that did not grow cotton in the past will also grow it. New cotton-growing areas lack cotton-growing experience, and technical forces are also insufficient. This is a new problem in development. The practice of drawing experienced technical backbones with rich cotton planting experience from old cotton-growing areas in Zhejiang to new cotton-growing areas to provide guidance is worth promoting.

### 力争超过一亿担

    力争超过一亿担
    全国农业先进单位代表会议在十大倡议中提出，今年全国棉花生产任务为一亿担皮棉，并且要力争超过！
    现在春暖冰消，栽种棉花季节即将来到。棉花是技术性很强的作物，抓紧每一道生产环节，对完成今年的跃进指标具有决定性的意义。目前，应该抓好春播这一关。搞好春播有两个主要环节：一个是适时播种，不误节令；另一个是提高播种质量（特别是施足底肥），力求精益求精。
    各棉产地区党政领导部门，应当充分运用去年大跃进中的经验，对春播准备工作组织一次检查，发现哪里准备工作薄弱，就加强哪里的领导，一定在棉花播种前，使社社、队队的准备工作做到“万事俱备”。
    今年，全国棉花播种面积将要扩大，一些过去没有种棉花的地区也要种棉。新棉区缺乏种棉经验，技术力量也不足，这是发展中的新问题。浙江老棉区抽调有丰富植棉经验的技术骨干到新棉区去做辅导工作，是值得提倡的做法。
