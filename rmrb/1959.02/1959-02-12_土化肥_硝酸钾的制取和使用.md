    Soil Fertilizer - The Production and Use of Potassium Nitrate
    Qiao Shenghui
    Potassium nitrate, also known as saltpeter or earth nitrate, is a raw material for making black gunpowder and also a very good chemical fertilizer. It is a white crystalline substance that easily deliquesces. Potassium nitrate is produced in abundance in China, such as in Baoding, Lixian, and Cangxian in central Hebei Province, the Jinzhong area of Shanxi Province, and Henan Province. The Northwest, Northeast, and South China can also produce it.
    The molecular formula of potassium nitrate is KNO3. The refined product contains about 14% nitrogen and about 45% potassium oxide. The nitrogen and potassium in it are both fast-acting. Potassium nitrate is very soluble in water; one hundred catties of water can dissolve thirty-two catties of it. When applied to the soil, crops can quickly absorb it, and the fertilizer effect is very good.
    The raw materials for potassium nitrate are nitrate soil, toilet soil, old wall soil, etc., which can be collected near rural toilets or in relatively humid places. Nitrate soil mainly contains potassium nitrate and sodium chloride (table salt), which are formed by the decomposition and transformation of nitrogen-containing substances such as animal manure, fallen leaves, weeds, and animal and plant corpses by microorganisms into ammonia. This ammonia flows into the soil and is converted into nitrates through nitrification, and then accumulates on the soil surface through the capillary action of the soil. The potassium nitrate in old wall soil is formed in a similar way to that of nitrate soil, but it is mainly formed by the capillary action of nitrates in groundwater. Generally, nitrate soil contains about 0.7% potassium nitrate, followed by sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, etc.
    The method for making potassium nitrate is to first leach the nitrate soil with water. If necessary, some plant ash can be added to the nitrate soil to supplement potassium. The potassium nitrate, sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, etc. in the nitrate soil will mostly dissolve in the water. Then, the leachate is boiled and concentrated. By utilizing the difference in the solubility of potassium nitrate, sodium chloride, and magnesium chloride in cold and hot water, potassium nitrate can be separated. The amount of sodium chloride and magnesium chloride that dissolves in hot and cold water is about the same. For example, thirty-six catties of sodium chloride can dissolve in one hundred catties of water at 20 degrees Celsius, and thirty-nine catties can dissolve in one hundred catties of water at 100 degrees Celsius. However, thirty-two catties of potassium nitrate can dissolve in one hundred catties of water at 20 degrees Celsius, and two hundred and forty-seven catties can dissolve in one hundred catties of water at 100 degrees Celsius. During the boiling process of the leachate, impurities such as sodium chloride will continuously crystallize out, while a large amount of potassium nitrate dissolves in the boiling water. When the leachate is boiled to a certain extent, the impurities such as sodium chloride are removed, and the boiled liquid is poured into a vat to cool. Since potassium nitrate dissolves very little in cold water, the crystals that form after the water cools are potassium nitrate. Finally, after drying, a crude potassium nitrate product is obtained. Generally, crude products contain about 10% nitrogen and 25% to 30% potassium oxide. The crude product is dissolved in water and recrystallized to obtain a refined product. Refined products generally contain about 14% nitrogen and about 45% potassium oxide. However, as a fertilizer, the crude product can be used without refining.
    Precautions for the manufacture and application of potassium nitrate:
    1.  Nitrate soil must be collected before the rainy season, preferably in the spring. Because potassium nitrate is very soluble in water, it will be leached into the lower layers of the soil by rainwater during the rainy season, and the nitrate soil obtained will not contain potassium nitrate or will contain very little.
    2.  Potassium nitrate is a fast-acting fertilizer and should not be used as a base fertilizer, but as a top dressing.
    3.  Potassium nitrate contains less nitrogen and more potassium, and should be applied to crops that require a lot of potassium, such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, and tobacco.
    4.  Potassium nitrate should not be mixed with farm manure such as human urine and manure, because this will cause the fast-acting nitrogen in potassium nitrate to be fixed by microorganisms, making the fertilizer effect slow. However, it can be mixed with ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and superphosphate without affecting each other.
    5.  After the potassium nitrate crystals are removed, the remaining brownish solution is brine. Brine can also be used as a fertilizer, and it is widely used in rural areas of North China, where the masses believe it has a very good effect. It contains fast-acting nitrogen and soluble potassium. Generally, brine contains 2% to 4% fast-acting nitrogen and about 3% potassium oxide. It can be applied in sandy soil, irrigated land, and areas with low groundwater levels.

    土化肥——硝酸钾的制取和使用
    乔生辉
    硝酸钾就是火硝，也有叫土硝的，是配黑色火药的原料，也是一种很好的化学肥料。它是一种白色的结晶体，很容易潮解。硝酸钾在我国的产量很丰富，如河北省中部保定、蠡县、沧县，山西省晋中一带及河南等省产量都很大；西北、东北及华南也都能生产。
    硝酸钾的分子式是KNO3，精制品含氮素14％左右，含氧化钾45％左右。其中的氮素及钾都是速效性的。硝酸钾极易溶解于水，一百斤水能溶解三十二斤。施入土壤后，作物能很快吸收，肥效很好。
    硝酸钾的原料是硝土、厕所土、老墙土等，农村厕所旁或比较阴湿的地方都可以收集到。硝土中主要含有硝酸钾及氯化钠（食盐），成因是动物粪尿及其它落叶、杂草、动植物尸体等含氮物质，经微生物的分解转化成氨，流失于土壤中，经硝化作用转化成硝酸盐，再由土壤的毛细管作用积结到土壤表层而形成。老墙土中的硝酸钾与硝土的成因相仿，不过主要是由地下水中的硝酸盐再经土壤毛细管的作用形成。一般硝土中约含0.7％左右的硝酸钾，其次是氯化钠、氯化镁等。
    硝酸钾的制法，首先将硝土用水浸提。必要时硝土中可加一些草木灰，补充钾素。硝土中的硝酸钾、氯化钠、氯化镁等就大部溶解于水中，然后将浸提液熬煮浓缩。利用硝酸钾、氯化钠、氯化镁在冷、热水中溶解的多少不同，就能将硝酸钾分离出来。氯化钠、氯化镁在热水冷水中溶解的量是差不多的，例如氯化钠在摄氏二十度的一百斤水中能溶解三十六斤，在一百度的一百斤水中能溶解三十九斤；而硝酸钾在二十度的一百斤水中能溶解三十二斤，在一百度的一百斤水中能溶二百四十七斤。浸提液在熬煮过程中，氯化钠等杂质就不断结晶析出，而硝酸钾却大量的溶解在沸腾的水中。当浸提液熬煮到一定程度，把氯化钠等杂质捞出，将熬煮液倒入缸中进行冷却。由于硝酸钾在冷水中溶解的很少，待水冷却后，结晶出来的东西就是硝酸钾。最后晾干，就得出硝酸钾粗制品。一般粗制品含氮素10％左右，氧化钾25％到30％。将粗制品用水溶解，重新结晶，就能得出精制品。精制品一般含氮素14％左右，氧化钾45％左右。不过作为肥料，粗制品就可以施用，不需精制。
    硝酸钾的制造、施用注意事项：
    一、采取硝土一定要在雨季之前，最好是在春季。因为硝酸钾是极易溶于水的，在雨季就被雨水淋洗到土壤下层，所得的硝土不含硝酸钾或含量极少。
    二、硝酸钾是速效肥料，不宜作为基肥，应作为追肥。
    三、硝酸钾中含氮少而含钾多，应施于需钾多的作物如马铃薯、甘薯、烟草等。
    四、硝酸钾不宜和农家肥如人粪尿、厩肥等混合施用，这样会使硝酸钾中的速效氮被微生物固定，使肥效迟缓。但与硫酸铵、硝酸铵、过磷酸钙可以混合施用，互不影响。
    五、当硝酸钾结晶取出后，剩下来的带褐色的溶液就是卤水。卤水亦可作为肥料，在华北农村中施用的也不少，群众认为效果很好。其中含有速效氮及可溶性钾，一般卤水中含速效氮2％到4％，氧化钾3％左右，可在砂壤土、水浇地、地下水位低的地区施用。
