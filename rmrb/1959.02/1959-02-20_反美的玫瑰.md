    Anti-American Rose
    Argentina　Hulio Vasi

    In the place where the distant stars dwell, I once met a rose, an Argentine rose. I said to her: "I am a wandering poet, and I want you to tell me many things." She blushed and answered me: "I want to tell you about the Yankees."
    If you see mad patrol planes making birds tremble, shaking tables and chairs, and plants and trees fearing and restless, that is the Yankees at Ezeiza①.
    If you see a naval officer sailing with chewing gum pirates, using black cannons and wearing white gloves, that is the Yankees at sea.
    If you see puppet officers, glaring with their jackal eyes, suddenly bombing peace, it is the Yankees behind them.
    If you see chimneys billowing smoke, workers losing patience, and dust and struggle enveloping everything, it is the Yankees as managers.
    If you see yellow daffodils② at night, sugarcane bleeding, and a lack of bread, a gentleman riding in a spacious car, it is the Yankees in Tucumán③.
    If you see a despicable ambassador holding a ceremony in the blue south with lovely spires, and subservient ministers running to attend, it is the Yankees in Patagonia.
    If you see naked, drunken grape goddesses, young green hands holding thunder, armed struggle, it is the Yankees in Mendoza④.
    If you see cinchona trees burning with raging red flames, lumberjacks starving, wages low, and mighty anger being aroused, it is because of the Yankees in Santiago.
    If you see tall candles, dim candlesticks, bejeweled ladies, priests wearing clerical robes holding a funeral, lamenting some kind of disaster, it is the Yankees in the church.
    If you see black bodies on the docks, under cranes, or on the La Plata River, fine rain pouring on them, the Yankees are in that port.
    If you see moon lovers, like lovely heavenly petals accompanying red rockets, the Yankees are in death.
    If you see the people of the old world united vigorously and closely, their heartbeats like deep drumbeats, the Yankees are on the gallows.
    If you see thousands of peace doves衝擊黑霧 (translators note: the literal translation is "冲撃" but I don't know the implied meaning, I suspect it is more than just a strike), and breaking it down, carnations and myrrh are born, the Yankees are in the grave.
    In the place where the distant stars dwell, I once met a rose, an Argentine rose, I said to her: "I am a wandering poet, and I want you to tell me many things." She blushed and answered me: "I want to tell you about the Yankees."

    反美的玫瑰  
    阿根廷　胡立欧·瓦西在那远方的星星居住的地方，我曾遇见一朵玫瑰花，阿根廷的玫瑰花。我对她说：“我是流浪诗人，想要你告诉我很多事情。”她红着脸回答我：“我要把美国佬对你讲一讲。”如果你看见疯狂的巡逻机使飞鸟战栗，震动桌椅，草木惧怕，不能安宁，那就是美国佬在艾赛易沙①。如果你看见一个海军军官，和口胶糖的海盗们在航行，用黑色的炮，戴白色的手套，那是美国佬在海上。如果你看见傀儡军官，瞪着他们那野狗的眼，突然轰炸和平，那是有美国佬在他们背后。如果你看见冒着浓烟的烟囱，工人们失去了耐性到处笼罩着尘烟和搏斗，是美国佬当经理。如果在深夜你看到黄色的水仙②，甘蔗在流血，而缺少面包，一位老爷乘着宽敞的轿车，是美国佬在图库曼③。如果你在有着可爱的塔尖的蓝色的南方，看见一个卑鄙的大使在举行仪礼，仆从的部长们都跑去参加，那是美国佬在巴塔哥尼亚。如果你看见裸体的酩酊的葡萄女神，年轻的绿手中拿着雷，武装争斗，那是美国佬在门多萨④。如果你看到金鸡纳霜树燃熊熊的赤焰，伐木者挨饿，工资低微，雄壮的怒火被激起，那是因美国佬在圣地亚哥。如果你看见长大的腊烛，灰暗的烛台，珠光宝气的夫人，穿着教衣的教士做殡仪，那是哭诉着某种灾难，那是美国佬在教堂里。如果你在码头上、在起重机下，或在拉巴拉他河上看见黑人的尸体，细雨浇在他身上，美国佬就在那港口上。如果你看见月亮恋人，像可爱的天上的花瓣伴着红色的火箭，美国佬就在死亡。如果你看见旧世界的人民朝气勃勃地紧紧地团结起来，他们的心跳像深沉的鼓鸣，美国佬就在绞架上。如果你看见千万只和平鸽冲击黑雾，并把它冲垮，石竹花和没药花诞生，美国佬就在坟墓中。在那远方的星星居住的地方，我曾遇见一朵玫瑰花，阿根廷的玫瑰花，我对她说：“我是流浪诗人，想要你告诉我很多事情。”她红着脸回答我：“我要把美国佬对你讲一讲。”〔注〕布宜诺斯艾利斯附近的小市镇的古称。

    图库曼和门多萨二城都属于西部的安的斯山区，图库曼种植甘蔗。门多萨种植葡萄和各种水果，冬季成熟，多运往美国。
