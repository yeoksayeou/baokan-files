    Terms of Address for Ordinary People Since the Song and Yuan Dynasties
    Liu Mianzhi
    In old operas, the young male lead often recites his school name and official name, indicating that in feudal society, students acquired a school name upon entering school, and once they became officials, they had an official name. So, what were ordinary people called before they went to school or became officials? In operas, waiters in inns are invariably called "Shopkeeper Xiao Er." As for the general populace, historical records rarely mention their affairs, so for many years, this question has remained unanswered.
    Unable to find answers in official histories, one has to read miscellaneous books. After reading miscellaneous books for some years, this doubt has been resolved. It turns out that the mark of class did not even spare ordinary people the right to choose their own names. In ancient feudal society, commoners without official positions or academic achievements had neither a school name nor an official name. How were they addressed then? Using their position in the family lineage or a number calculated from their parents' ages as a symbol. How can this be proven? Qing dynasty scholar Yu Yue in his "Spring in the Hall Jottings, Volume 5" states:
        Xu Chengan saw in the Cai family genealogy of
    Deqing a small line of text written by an ancestor: "The
    Yuan dynasty stipulated that commoners
    without positions were not allowed to take names, but
    instead used their birth order and
    the combined ages of their parents as their name." This is
    not found in the Yuan History. However, evidence from
    the name used by Emperor Gao (Ming
    Taizu) for his elder brother is exactly
    like this, proving that this was indeed
    a Yuan dynasty decree. In the
    Shaoxing countryside today, there are many who use
    numerical characters as names, such
    as if the husband is twenty-four years old and the wife is twenty
    -two years old, combining to forty-six, the son is named
    Si-Liu (Forty-Six). If the husband is twenty-
    three years old and the wife is twenty-
    two years old, combining to forty-five, the son may be named
    Wu-Jiu (Five-Nine), Five-Nine being forty-five.
    Yu Yue further extends Xu Chengan's theory, pointing out that Chang Yuchun's great-grandfather was Si-San (Four-Three), grandfather was Chong-Wu (Double Five), and father was Liu-Liu (Six-Six). Tang He's great-grandfather was Wu-Yi (Five-One), grandfather was Liu-Yi (Six-One), and father was Qi-Yi (Seven-One), all named with numerical characters. He also cites Song Hongmai's "Yijian Zhi," which records Song dynasty anecdotes, including names such as Xiong Er (Bear Two) of the Xingguo Army, Liu Shi-Er (Liu Twelve) of Poyang City, Zhou San (Zhou Three), a farmer from Nancheng, Wei Liu (Wei Six), a commoner from Poyang, Cong Si (Cong Four) from Fuli, Yin Er (Yin Two), a fisherman from Shanyang County, Chuzhou, Liang Xiao-Er (Liang Little Two), a villager from Chi Xi Township, An'yi, Jie Prefecture, Dong Xiao-Qi (Dong Little Seven) from Linchuan, Zhang Si (Zhang Four), a resident of Wuyuan, Huizhou, Li Shi-Liu (Li Sixteen), a resident of Huangzhou, Cui San (Cui Three), a servant, and Zheng Xiao-Wu (Zheng Little Five), a villager from Poyang, and Chen Er (Chen Two), a farmer from Xiaoshun Town, Jinhua, etc. Based on these examples, he analyzes that, firstly, these people were all ordinary people; secondly, the regions included present-day Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Hubei, etc.; and thirdly, the names were all calculated using the numerical order of their siblings, therefore, he concludes that "it is suspected that ordinary people in the Song dynasty alleys did not have names."
    In fact, many commoner names from the Song Dynasty appear in the marriage documents of Qingming Collection, such as Shen Yi-Liu Xiu, Xu Zong-Wu Xiu, Jin Bai-Er Xiu, Li Liu-Jiu Xiu, and so on. Ming Taizu's father was called Wu-Si (Five Four), styled Shizhen, his second brother Chong-Liu (Double Six) styled Xingsheng, and his third brother Chong-Qi (Double Seven) styled Xingzu. Ming Taizu was originally called Chong-Ba (Double Eight), styled Xingzong, as seen in Pan Zhang's "Examination of National History" citing Cheng Xiu-Duan-Hui-Wang Tongzong's "Collected Records of Cord Dwelling." This shows that Ming Taizu's family was originally named with numbers. As for names like Shizhen and Xingzong, which resemble academic or official names, they were probably given after Ming Taizu rose to the ruling class.
    If commoners in the Anhui region were named this way in the early Ming, then so too were they in Jiangsu. For example, Zhang Shicheng was originally named Jiu-Si (Nine-Four). Huang Pu's "Idle Chats on Past and Present" says: "Someone told Zhu Yuanzhang that Zhang Shicheng doted on men of letters his whole life, but was fooled by them. He was originally named Jiu-Si, but after becoming a prince, he wanted an official name, and someone gave him the name Shicheng. Zhu Yuanzhang said: 'Good, this name is not bad.' That person said: 'No, he's been greatly fooled.' In Mencius, there is the saying: 'A scholar is truly a petty person.' This sentence can also be read as 'Shicheng is a petty person.' He was cursed as a petty person for half his life, and he didn't even realize it until he died, truly pitiable." This shows that Zhang Shicheng's name was also given to him later.
    It's not just the Song, Yuan, and early Ming dynasties; even in Shaoxing during the late Qing dynasty, and even into the early years of the Republic of China, the tradition of this class-based naming system was preserved in the Shaoxing area. Don't believe it? Lu Xun's works are proof. In his essay "Village Opera," the names he lists include Ba-Gonggong (Eighth Grandpa), Liu-Yi-Gonggong (Sixty-One Grandpa), etc. In another essay, there is also Old Lady Jiu-Jin (Nine Pounds).
    Above, we mentioned that people in the Song dynasty had the character "秀" (xiu, elegant/outstanding) in their names, which was also a common term of address for commoners since the Song and Yuan dynasties, indicating status and position. In early Ming Nanjing, there was Shen Wansan Xiu, a great tycoon, who was targeted by Ming Taizu, his family fortune confiscated, and he was exiled to Yunnan. Besides "秀", there was also "郎" (lang, young man/husband). Wang Yingkui's "Jottings from Liunan, Volume 5" says: "Tang Tingwei's 'Daily Records of Leisure' states: 'In the early Ming dynasty, there were two types of address for commoners: one was 秀, and the other was 郎. 秀 referred to descendants of distinguished families, outstanding individuals, while 郎 referred to the insignificant offspring of minor families, the common rabble. Calling someone 秀 was 'So-and-so Xiu,' while calling someone 郎 was 'So-and-so Lang.' People were assigned their place, and could not cross over.'" This shows that from the Song to the Ming dynasty, sons of officials and nobles were called "秀," while commoners in the marketplace could only be called "郎," and one could not call people whatever one wanted. Shen Wansan was called "秀" because he was rich. Another example, Liu Da-Xiu, who gave burial land to Zhu Yuanzhang, was the son of an official. "Gazetteer of Fengyang County, Guangxu Period, Volume 12: 'Liu Jizu's grandfather, Xuelao, served as a general manager during the Yuan dynasty.'" Jizu was the firstborn, so he was called Da-Xiu (Big Xiu).
    Thus, we understand the reason why men in folk stories performed in operas are called "so-and-so Lang." It's also why the story of the Oil Seller Lang's exclusive possession of the courtesan is called "The Story of the Oil Seller Lang." Furthermore, there was a saying in Ming and Qing society, "不郎不秀" (bu lang bu xiu, neither lang nor xiu), which was used to scold people for being useless, neither high nor low. Even in modern times, some regions still retain this saying, but few people understand its original meaning.
    From the above miscellaneous books, we can see the situation of commoner addresses since the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties. Can these addresses be considered names? No. There is also written proof. When Ming Taizu became a monk, he received help from the Wang and Liu families. After becoming emperor, he made members of these two families officials and also gave two names to the friends of these families from his youth. Ming Taizu's "Collected Works, Volume 5, Edict Giving Names to Wang Wen and Liu Ying": "Now, the Wang and Liu surnames are diligent in agriculture in the countryside, and these people have not yet been named, so I specially bestow upon them the names Wen and Ying." Assuming that the ages of Wang Wen and Liu Ying were not far from that of Ming Taizu, around seventeen or eighteen in 1344, then by the early Hongwu period, they would have been over forty years old, and still without names. The reason is that they worked as farmers their whole lives. It can be seen that their original numerical symbols, whether based on birth order or the combined ages of their parents, could not be considered names. They had never attended school, never been officials, and thus remained nameless people their entire lives. These two people, because of their friendship with the emperor, became officials and clerks. Since officials should have official names to appear official, the imperial decree bestowed names, thus breaking the precedent and giving them names.
    This explains why official histories never mention this matter. Not only is it "unattested in the Yuan History," but it is also unattested in any history.

### 宋元以来老百姓的称呼

    宋元以来老百姓的称呼
    刘勉之
    旧戏上小生的道白，常有学名什么，官名什么，足见在封建社会里学生上学起学名，一旦作了官又有官名。那末，没上学，没作官以前，平常老百姓叫什么呢？戏文上凡是旅店里的服务员，一律都叫作店小二。至于一般人，因为史书上很少纪载老百姓的事情，多年来也只好阙疑了。
    求之正史不得，只好读杂书，读了些年杂书，这个疑算是解决了。原来阶级的烙印连老百姓起名字的权利也不曾放过，在古代封建社会里，平民百姓没有功名的，是既没有学名，也没有官名的。怎么称呼呢？用行辈或者父母年龄合算一个数目作为一个符号。何以见得？清俞樾春在堂随笔卷五说：
        徐诚庵见德清蔡氏家谱有
    前辈书小字一行云：元制庶人
    无职者不许取名，而以行第及
    父母年龄合计为名，此于元史
    无征。然证以高皇帝（明太
    祖）所称其兄之名，正是如
    此，其为元时令甲无疑矣。现在
    绍兴乡间颇有以数目字为名
    者，如夫年二十四，妇年二十
    二，合为四十六，生子即名四
    六。夫年二十三，妇年二十
    二，合为四十五，生子或为五
    九，五九四十五也。
    俞樾又引申徐诚庵之说，指出明初常遇春的曾祖四三，祖重五，父六六。汤和曾祖五一，祖六一，父七一，亦以数目字为名。他又引宋洪迈夷坚志所载宋时杂事，有兴国军民熊二，鄱阳城民刘十二，南城田夫周三，鄱阳小民隗六，符离人从四，楚州山阳县渔者尹二，解州安邑池西乡民梁小二，临川人董小七，徽州婺源民张四，黄州市民李十六，仆崔三，鄱阳乡民郑小五，金华孝顺镇农民陈二等等，根据这些例子分析，其一，这些人都是平常百姓，其二，地区包括现在的安徽、浙江、江西、山西、湖北等地，其三，称呼都以排行数字计算，因此，下的结论是“疑宋时里巷细民，固无名也。”
    其实，宋代平民姓名见于清明集户婚门的很多，如沈亿六秀，徐宗五秀，金百二秀，黎六九秀之类。明太祖的父亲叫五四，名世珍，二哥重六名兴盛，三哥重七名兴祖，明太祖原来也叫重八，名兴宗，见潘柽章国史考异引承休端惠王统宗绳蛰录，可见明太祖一家原来都以数字命名的。至于世珍兴宗这一类学名官名性质的名字，大概都是明太祖爬上统治阶级以后所追起的。
    明初安徽地区的平民如此，江苏也是如此。例如张士诚原名九四，黄溥闲中今古录说：“有人告诉朱元璋，张士诚一辈子宠待文人，却上了文人的当。他原名九四，作了王爷后，要起一个官名，有人替他起名士诚。朱元璋说：
  ‘好啊，这名字不错。’那人说：
  ‘不然，上大当了’。孟子上有：
  ‘士，诚小人也。’这句话也可以读作‘士诚，小人也。’骂张士诚是小人，给人叫了半辈子小人，到死还不明白，真是可怜。”可见张士诚的名字也是后来起的。
    不只是宋、元，明初以及清朝后期的绍兴，甚至到清朝末年以至民国初年，绍兴地方还保留着这个阶级烙印的传统，不信吗？有鲁迅先生的著作为证。他在“社戏”一文中所列举的人名就有八公公，六一公公之类，在另一篇中还有九斤老太呢。
    上面讲到宋朝的人名下面有带着秀字的，秀也是宋元以来的民间称呼，是表示身份地位的。明初南京有沈万三秀，是个大财主，让明太祖看中了，被没收家财，还充军到云南。秀之外又有郎，王应奎柳南随笔卷五说：“江阴汤廷尉公余日录云：明初闾里称呼有二等，一曰秀，一曰郎。秀则故家右族，颖出之人，郎则微裔末流，群小之辈。称秀则曰某几秀，称郎则曰某几郎，人自分定，不相逾越。”可见从宋到明，官僚贵族子弟称秀，市井平民则只能称郎，是不能乱叫的。沈万三称秀是因为有钱。另一个例子，送坟地给朱元璋的那个刘大秀则是官僚子弟，光绪凤阳县志卷十二：“刘继祖父学老，仕元为总管。”继祖排行第一，所以叫作大秀。
    这样，也就懂得戏文里演的民间故事，男人叫作什么郎的道理了。也就难怪卖油郎独占花魁这个故事，秦小官卖油，就叫作卖油郎的来由了。还有，明清两代社会上有一句话“不郎不秀”，是骂人不成材，高不成低不就的意思，一直到现代，还有些地区保留这句话，却很少人懂得原来的含意了。
    从以上一些杂书，可以看出，宋元明以来的平民称呼情况，这类称呼算不算名字呢，不算。也有书可证。明太祖出家时得到过汪刘两家人的帮助。作了皇帝后他封这两家人作官，还送给这两家青年时代的朋友两个名字，明太祖文集卷五赐汪文刘英敕：“今汪姓刘姓者见勤农于乡里，其人尚未立名，特赐之以名曰文，曰英。”汪文刘英的年龄假定和明太祖相去不远，公元1344年约年十七八岁，那末，到洪武初年已经四十多岁了，还没有名字。其道理是作了一辈子农民。可见他们原来的无论行辈或者合计父母年龄的数字符号都不能算名字，没有上过学，没有作过官，也就一辈子作个无名之人。这两个人因为和皇帝有交情，作了署令史官，作官应该有官名，像个官样子，圣旨赐名，才破例有了名字。
    这也就难怪正史上从来不讲这个事情的道理了。不但“元史无征”，什么史也是无征的道理了。
