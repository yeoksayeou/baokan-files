    Strive for Self-Sufficiency in Southern Coal
    Sichuan Builds Coal Base Network Around Steel Plants
    Guangdong Advances on Three Fronts to Guarantee Doubled Coal Production
    (Our dispatch from Chengdu, February 18) Sichuan Province is launching a large-scale coal base network construction effort to store up grain and prepare fodder for the great leap forward in steel and other industrial production and construction. Near industrial bases such as Chongqing and Chengdu, and along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and Baoji-Chengdu Railway, eight bases have already officially commenced operations. The total annual production capacity of the mines being built throughout the province this year will reach over 20 million tons, of which approximately 11 million tons can be put into production this year.
    The Sichuan Provincial Coal Industry leadership considers accelerating base construction as a primary measure to rapidly develop the coal industry. Given the province's weak coal industry foundation and uneven regional distribution, Sichuan's coal base construction this year will prioritize meeting the needs of steel and railway line industries and transportation, and will be divided into three categories based on the province's characteristic of dispersed iron smelting and centralized steelmaking: First, around large and medium-sized steel bases such as Chongqing, Chengdu, and Jiangyou, the Nantong, Zhongliangshan, Hualingshan, and Yongchuan-Rongchang coal and coking coal production bases will be expanded and newly built on a large scale. The scale of mine construction in these areas this year accounts for more than half of the province's mine construction tasks. These areas will also construct washing plants with an annual production capacity of approximately 10 million tons. Second, around more than 20 small steel plants throughout the province, dozens of medium and small-sized mines with an annual production capacity of 300,000 to 600,000 tons and a number of simple or indigenous washing plants will be constructed. Third, based on future industrial and transportation development and regional balance requirements, coking coal bases and anthracite bases will be constructed in resource-rich areas such as Xichang, Linshui, Daxian, and Furongshan, respectively.
    Because the scale of coal base construction throughout the province is very large this year, a combination of specialized departments and local forces is adopted. While starting work comprehensively, priorities are also clarified, and efforts are concentrated to ensure key projects, striving to put these mines into production in stages. In order to accelerate the construction of the four major coal and coking coal production bases of Nantong, Zhongliangshan, Hualingshan, and Yongrong, the province has concentrated more than 60% of its investment in the mines and washing plants in these areas and has tried its best to meet their needs in terms of equipment, materials, and technical strength. Thanks to the close cooperation of design, construction, supply, and production departments, the new wells put into production in these four bases this year can reach an annual production capacity of approximately 6 million tons. While constructing large-scale modern washing plants in these areas, active preparations are also being made for the construction of a number of simple washing plants.
    The bases along the Baoji-Chengdu Railway and in Xichang, Furongshan, Linshui, Daxian, and other areas, as well as the medium and small-sized mines in various special districts, have already been started using indigenous methods, and preparations are being actively made for power supply to expand the scale of construction.
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Guangdong Province is simultaneously strengthening the coal industry from three aspects: capital construction, production, and transportation. This year, the province requires the production of more than twice the highest annual output in history in 1958, achieving self-sufficiency in most coal.
    Currently, the main force in Guangdong's coal industry—one hundred and one medium-sized new mines with an annual output of more than 100,000 tons—have already begun or are about to begin construction, of which more than twenty are under intense construction. The provincial departments concerned have concentrated design forces and established basic construction teams to accelerate the construction of the Luojiadu, Lianyang, Nanling and other coal mines with large output and good coal quality in the northern Guangdong area. It is estimated that all the projects of these one hundred and one new mines will be completed in the next two years, at which time the total annual production capacity will reach more than 10 million tons. Simultaneously with the construction of new medium-sized coal mines, three hundred and five small coal mines will also be vigorously renovated and expanded. Among them, two hundred small coal mines will be equipped with mechanical power. After all these small coal mines are renovated, each will have an annual production capacity of 20,000 to 50,000 tons. The renovation and expansion of small coal mines will strive to be completed in the second quarter.
    While building, existing mines and small coal mines are stepping up production. Many areas have launched a technical innovation movement, tapping potential and increasing coal production.
    Since most coal mines are located in remote areas and the speed of production development is extremely fast, the situation of transportation not keeping up with production needs has already emerged. In order to transport coal from the mining areas in a timely manner, the relevant departments are building light railways and highways leading to the mining areas and vigorously improving river channels. The coal transportation light railway being built in the Shaoguan area is more than 100 kilometers long.
    The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and relevant departments have given priority to the supply of equipment needed for capital construction, production, and transportation of the coal industry. In the steel allocated for the manufacture of various equipment in the first quarter, coal industry equipment accounted for one-fifth.

    力争南方煤炭自给
    四川围绕钢铁厂大建煤炭基地网
    广东三路进军保证煤炭产量翻番
    本报成都18日电　四川省展开大规模的煤炭基地网建设工作，为钢铁等工业生产建设的大跃进储粮备草。在重庆、成都等工业基地附近和成渝铁路、宝成铁路沿线，目前已有八个基地正式开工。全省今年建设的矿井的年产能力将达二千万吨以上，其中一千一百万吨左右今年内就可以投入生产。
    四川省煤炭工业领导部门把加速基地建设作为当前迅速发展煤炭工业的一项主要措施。根据全省煤炭工业基础薄弱、地区分布不平衡的情况，今年四川省煤炭基地的建设，从首先保证钢铁和铁路沿线工业、交通用煤的需要出发，按照全省分散炼铁、集中炼钢的特点分为三类：一、在重庆、成都、江油等大型和中型钢铁基地附近，大规模扩建和新建南桐、中梁山、华蓥山、永（川）荣（昌）等四个主要煤、焦生产基地。这些地区今年的建井规模占全省矿井建设任务一半以上。这些地区还要建设年产能力约一千万吨的洗选厂。二、在全省二十多个小型钢铁厂附近，建设几十对年产能力三十万吨到六十万吨的中小型矿井和一批简易或土法洗选厂。三、根据将来工业交通发展和地区平衡的要求，在资源丰富的西昌、邻水、达县、芙蓉山等地分别建设炼焦煤基地和无烟煤基地。
    由于今年全省煤炭基地建设规模很大，采取专业部门和地方力量结合的办法，在全面动工的同时，又分清主次，集中力量保证重点，争取这些矿井分期分批投入生产。为了加速建设南桐、中梁山、华蓥山、永荣四个主要煤、焦生产基地，全省集中了60％以上的投资用于这些地区的矿井和洗选厂，并在设备、器材、技术力量等方面尽量给以满足。由于设计、施工、供应、生产部门的密切配合，今年内这四个基地投入生产的新井年产能力可达六百万吨左右。这些地区在建设大型现代化洗选厂的同时，还积极准备建设一批简易洗选厂。
    宝成铁路沿线和西昌、芙蓉山、邻水、达县等基地以及各专区的中小型矿井，已经用土法上马，并积极准备电源等，以便扩大施工规模。
    据新华社讯　广东省从基本建设、生产、运输三方面同时加强煤炭工业。今年全省要求生产出比历史上产量最高的1958年度还多一倍以上的煤，做到大部分煤炭自给。
    现在，广东煤炭工业中的主力军——一百零一对年产十万吨以上的中型新矿井已经或即将开始建设，其中有二十多对正在紧张施工。省有关部门对产量大、煤质好的粤北地区罗家渡、连阳、南岭等煤矿，已集中设计力量，建立基本施工队伍来加速建设。预计这一百零一对新建矿井的全部工程，将分别在今明两年内建成，那时每年总生产能力将达到一千多万吨。与新建中型煤井的同时，还将大力改建和扩建三百零五个小煤井。其中有二百个小煤井将要装备机械动力。这些小煤井全部经过改造后，每个都将具有二万到五万吨的年产能力。改建和扩建小煤井的工作，争取在第二季度内全部完成。
    在建设的同时，现有的矿井和小煤井都在加紧生产。不少地区已经展开了技术革新运动，挖掘潜力，增产煤炭。
    由于大多数煤矿地处偏僻，生产发展的速度又极快，目前已呈现运输赶不上生产需要的情况。为了使矿区煤炭及时运出，有关部门正在兴建通往矿区的轻便铁路、公路，大力整治河道。韶关专区正在兴建的运煤轻便铁路就有一百多公里。
    中共广东省委和有关部门优先安排了煤炭工业的基本建设、生产和交通运输所需设备的供应。第一季度制造各种设备所分配的钢材中，煤炭工业设备占了五分之一。
