    I Have a Leaping Heart (Lyrics)
　　I have a leaping heart, hoping for grain yields of 10,000 jin per mu, with abundant and strong rice, wheat, and millet, and cotton bolls as white as clouds. I have a leaping heart, wanting to turn barren land into gold, rocks yielding to my path, and rivers obeying my commands. I have a leaping heart, turning stubborn stones into iron and iron into gold, molten iron flowing in waves, and sparks of steel flying like stars in the sky. I have a leaping heart, riding a swift horse and rushing forward, with no high mountains or vast seas to stop me, wanting to pluck stars from the sky!

    我有一颗跃进心（歌词）
　　放平我有一颗跃进心，粮食亩产一万斤，稻谷麦黍多肥壮，棉花团团滚白云。我有一颗跃进心，要叫黄土变黄金，岩石见我把路让，河水听我发号令。我有一颗跃进心，顽石炼铁铁炼金，铁水奔流波浪涌，钢花飞出满天星。我有一颗跃进心，骑上快马向前奔，高山大海挡不住，要到天上摘星星！
