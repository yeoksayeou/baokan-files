Contact the Masses, Train Ourselves, Promote Production
Jiangxi Sends Large Numbers of Cadres Down to Become Commune Members

Nanchang, February 17th (report from our newspaper) – Jiangxi Province's measure of having Party committees at all levels send cadres down to people's communes in rotation to become "Five-Good" commune members has achieved excellent results.

The implementation of this measure has strengthened the leadership of the people's communes, further tightened the ties between cadres and the masses, thereby greatly promoting production and work, while also training and improving the cadres.

Jiangxi Province's initiative of sending cadres down to become "Five-Good" commune members was first started in Ganxian County. At the provincial Party congress held in January, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee summarized Ganxian's experience and promoted it throughout the province. The Provincial Party Committee believes that, due to the development of the people's commune movement, Party committees at all levels must continue to promote the excellent style of cadres going deep into reality and connecting with the masses, in order to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1959. At the same time, since the communes were established not long ago, cadres still lack leadership and management experience, which also requires cadres at all levels to go deep down to discover problems and explore and summarize experiences. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee requires Party committees at all levels to promote Ganxian's experience of sending cadres down to people's communes to become "Five-Good" commune members, and to send cadres down to the communes in batches and in rotation throughout the year to be commune members for one to three months. In the commune, they should completely obey the leadership of the commune's production team as ordinary commune members, eating, living, and working with the commune members, and strive to become "Five-Good" commune members who are good in ideology, good in labor, good in work, good in learning, and good in unity. At the same time, they should often listen to the masses' opinions and requirements for the commune, and assist the commune and team cadres in studying and solving problems, in order to strengthen the leadership of the commune. The Provincial Party Committee also stipulated that this measure should be established as a regular system and adhered to in the future.

After the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee put forward this call, it immediately received a warm response from Party organizations at all levels and the broad masses of cadres throughout the province. From January to now, the first batch of about 3,000 cadres at the prefectural, county, and commune levels throughout the province have gone to the communes to be commune members one after another, and more than 10,000 cadres have also been approved and will soon go to the communes to be commune members.

After the cadres went down to be commune members, each of them worked hard and went deep, eating, living, and working with the masses, enduring hardship first, and taking the lead in production. Therefore, they were warmly welcomed by the masses wherever they went, greatly encouraging the masses' enthusiasm for production. At the beginning, the progress of fertilizer accumulation in Zhangjia Brigade of Xingfu Commune in Lichuan County was slow. After Chen Xirong, the Minister of the Organization Department of the County Party Committee, came here to be a commune member, he realized that the masses had the idea that there was no fertilizer to be accumulated. He discussed with the captain and the commune members on the one hand, and personally went up the mountain with several commune members to find sources of fertilizer. As a result, the sources of fertilizer increased greatly, and the commune members all worked hard. In less than a week, the amount of fertilizer accumulated by the whole team increased from less than 100 loads per mu to more than 500 loads, and was rated as an advanced team in fertilizer accumulation by the whole commune. Lian Runsheng, Deputy Secretary of the Leping County Party Committee, and Lai Yawen and Li Wenyao, Deputy County Heads of Nankang County, participated in water conservancy construction in the commune, sleeping in thatched sheds and eating at the construction site with the commune members, regardless of wind, snow, and severe cold. They always started work in the morning before the commune members got up. Once, when Lai Yawen and Li Wenyao were working on a construction site, they happened to be digging river sand, and it started to snow heavily and the river water froze into thin ice. At this time, in order to ensure the progress of the project, they both took the lead in rolling up their trousers and jumping into the river to carry sand without hesitation. Therefore, they were unanimously rated as "vanguards in water conservancy battle" by the commune members that day, and a clapper talk was composed to praise them: The cadres who go down are vanguards, they bring prosperity wherever they go, they can overcome thousands of difficulties, and they motivate everyone to be a hero.

Because the cadres who went down to be commune members closely integrated with the masses, not only were their ideological and emotional ties with the masses closer, and they could often hear the masses' opinions and requirements, but they also more clearly felt and saw some problems existing in running the commune and in production, and promptly provided them to the commune leaders for research and assisted in solving them. Huang Cheyuan, Deputy Secretary of the Ganxian County Party Committee, and cadre Liu Zhongying found in Tiancun Commune that because labor management was not done well during the rectification of the commune, the commune members had many opinions on the evaluation of grade wages. Huang Cheyuan and Liu Zhongying reported this problem to the commune leaders and helped the commune cadres to further mobilize the masses to discuss and study, and finally proposed the method of implementing fixed grades and flexible wages, combining fixed grade wages with work points calculated on an hourly basis. In this way, everyone was satisfied, and the commune members' enthusiasm for production was greatly improved. Now this method has been promoted throughout the county.

    联系群众　锻炼自己　推动生产
    江西大批干部下放当社员
    本报南昌17日电　江西省各级党委下放干部轮流到人民公社当“五好”社员，得到了很好的效果。
    这个措施的执行，加强了人民公社的领导，进一步密切了干部与群众的联系，从而大大推动了生产和工作，同时也锻炼与提高了干部。
    江西省下放干部当“五好”社员最先是由赣县开始的。中共江西省委在1月份召开的全省党代表大会上总结了赣县的经验，普遍在各地推广。省委认为，由于人民公社化运动的发展，各级党委必须继续发扬干部深入实际、联系群众的优良作风，以争取1959年的工农业生产有更大更好更全面的跃进。同时，公社建立不久，干部还缺乏领导和管理的经验，这也要求各级干部深入下去发现问题，摸索和总结经验。因此，省委要求各级党委推广赣县下放干部到人民公社当“五好”社员的经验，一年中分期分批地轮流把干部下放到公社当一到三个月的社员，在公社里完全以一个普通社员的身分服从社的生产队的领导，与社员同吃同住同劳动，并争取成为思想好、劳动好、工作好、学习好、团结好的“五好”社员；同时，经常听取群众对公社的意见和要求，协助社、队干部研究解决问题，以加强公社的领导。省委并且规定，要把这个措施定为一项经常制度，在今后坚持下去。
    江西省委提出这个号召以后，立即得到了全省各级党组织和广大干部的热烈响应。自1月到现在，全省第一批三千名左右地、县、公社干部已先后到公社当社员，另有一万多名干部也已荣获批准，很快就到公社当社员。
    干部下放当社员以后，个个艰苦深入，与群众同吃同住同劳动，吃苦在前，带头生产。因此所到之处，受到了群众的热烈欢迎，大大鼓舞了群众的生产积极性。黎川县幸福公社张家大队开始积肥进度迟缓，县委组织部部长陈希荣到这里当社员以后，知道群众存在着无肥可积的思想，便一面同队长和社员们商量讨论，一面亲自同几个社员一起上山寻找肥源。结果肥源大大增加，社员们一齐鼓足了干劲，不到一个星期，全队积肥数量即由原来平均每亩不到一百担增加到五百多担，被全社评为了积肥上游队。乐平县委副书记廉润生、南康县副县长赖雅文、李文遥，都在公社参加了修水利，同社员一起睡在茅棚、吃在工地，不畏风雪严寒，总是社员们还未起床他们就早上工干活了。一次赖雅文、李文遥所在的工地上正赶挖河沙，碰到天降大雪，河水结了薄冰，这时为了保证工程进度，他们两个毫不犹豫地带头卷起裤腿，跳到河里挑沙。因此当天就被社员们一致评为“水利战斗尖兵”，并且编了快板夸奖他们：下放干部是尖兵，到了那里那里红，千层困难能克服，带动人人当英雄。
    由于下放当社员的干部紧紧的与群众打成一片，不仅在思想感情上与群众的联系更加密切了，能经常听到群众的意见和要求，同时也由此更清楚地感到和看到了办社和生产中存在的一些问题，及时提供给社的领导研究并协助解决。赣县县委副书记黄彻援和干部刘仲英在田村公社发现整社中因为劳动管理没有搞好，社员对级别工资的评法有许多意见。黄彻援和刘仲英便把这个问题反映给公社领导，并帮助公社干部进一步发动群众讨论研究，最后提出实行死级别活工资的办法，将固定的等级工资和按时计算的工分结合起来。这样人人满意，大大提高了社员的生产积极性。现在这个办法已在全县推广开来。
