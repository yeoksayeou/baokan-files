According to the Southern Daily News, with the arrival of the warm spring season, a more magnificent production movement than last year has been launched in the Zhangshi People's Commune in the suburbs of Shaoguan City. More than 10,000 laborers in this commune are fighting vigorously on all production fronts. The agricultural labor force, having achieved an average of over 1,800 dan of fertilizer accumulated per mu, continues to vigorously accumulate, produce, and deliver fertilizer, and is carrying out busy spring plowing activities, preparing fields and sowing seeds early, and planting various economic crops such as peanuts; the industrial labor force is building on a large scale, constructing a phosphate fertilizer plant, a granular fertilizer plant, and an agricultural tool repair and processing plant, rushing to produce fertilizer and agricultural tools. Other factories or workshops are also being built or are engaged in tense production.

In order to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year, and to further implement the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and simultaneously developing self-sufficient production and commodity production, the Zhangshi Commune has assigned sufficient personnel to all production fronts since the beginning of January, and has been working with full enthusiasm, setting off a vigorous mass production upsurge. In the past twenty-odd days, the commune has achieved remarkable results in preparing for production, focusing on deep plowing and fertilizer accumulation. As of January 28, a total of 57,360,000 dan of various fertilizers had been accumulated, with an average of 1,850 dan of fertilizer per mu based on the area planted with early and mid-season rice. Among them, the average amount of concentrated fertilizer was 837 dan per mu. More than 16,600 mu of fields were deeply plowed and the soil improved to a depth of more than one chi, and 1,900 mu of soil were fumigated. In conjunction with fertilizer accumulation and deep plowing, 515 small-scale water conservancy projects were repaired, and more than 2,580 new ox-cart roads and handcart roads were built. The work of selecting more than 4 million jin of improved varieties has also been basically completed. In the past few days, spring sowing and spring plowing have also begun. More than 600 head of cattle and more than 600 cattle herders are busily plowing and harrowing in the flat fields that have been deeply plowed. At present, more than 31,000 jin of seeds have been soaked, more than 21,000 jin have been sown, more than 500 mu have been harrowed, more than 1,000 mu of land for planting economic crops has been prepared, and more than 500 mu of early-maturing crops have been planted. The commune's land has seen a scene where the rice seedlings are green before the spring grass turns green.

The industrial production of this commune is also as intensive as agriculture. According to this year's plan to build 24 projects and 43 factory buildings, except for three projects including the fluorite, fiberboard factory, and leather factory that have not yet started construction, the other 21 are under construction, and some are already producing while being built. The phosphate fertilizer plant, lime plant, granular fertilizer plant, agricultural tool repair and processing plant, etc. that support agricultural production have produced more than 15,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer and 20,000 jin of granular fertilizer, rushed to produce 4 horse-drawn carts, 400 handcarts, 15 sweet potato cutting machines, 30 paddy field harrows, 1 seeder, and 370 ox carts, and repaired more than 3,500 handcarts and ox carts. The brick and tile factory, logging yard, iron smelting plant, and coal mine have also been put into normal production.

Recently, the sideline production and diversified operations of the Zhangshi Commune have also been continuously developing. In the first twenty-four days of January alone, 1.2 million jin of firewood, more than 11,000 jin of vegetables, more than 650 poultry, and more than 180 pigs were sold. In order to better, more, and faster develop sideline production this year, in addition to actively purchasing piglet and poultry seedlings, the commune strictly prohibits the slaughter of hens, ducks, and sows, and has established a fish fry breeding farm to vigorously engage in fish fry breeding.

In the rectification of the commune, the Zhangshi Commune has further strengthened labor management, adjusted wage levels, implemented a production responsibility system, and rationally arranged the labor force according to the needs of industrial and agricultural production. Now, the commune has implemented a quota management system, and the commune's various management areas and production teams have implemented a system of "five guarantees" (guaranteeing cost, targets, area, measures, and wages), "six fixings" (fixing time, quality, tasks, location, leadership, and personnel), and a system of "one competition, one evaluation, and one reward", so that everyone has a responsibility and everyone has a task, and the enthusiasm of the commune members is unprecedentedly high. While strengthening labor management, the commune has vigorously tapped labor potential and streamlined logistics personnel on the one hand, and rationally arranged the labor force according to the needs of industry, agriculture, diversified operations, and logistics work, and organized specialized teams. In addition, cadres at all levels of the commune have promoted the style of taking the lead in hard work, participating in production, and leading production, which has played a very good role in carrying out the production movement.

    春草未绿秧先绿　工业农业满堂红
    樟市公社热气腾腾
    据南方日报消息　随着春暖花开季节的来临，一个波澜壮阔的比去年更大规模的生产运动，已经在韶关市郊区樟市人民公社搞得热火朝天。这个公社的一万多个劳动力，正在各条生产战线上生龙活虎地战斗着。农业劳动大军在取得平均每亩积肥一千八百多担的成绩的基础上，继续大搞积肥、制肥、送肥，展开繁忙的春耕活动，提早整田和播种，多种经济作物如花生等也已经开始种植；工业劳动大军正在大兴土木，兴建磷肥厂、颗粒肥料厂和农具修配加工厂，赶制肥料和农具。其他工厂或工场也在加紧兴建或进行紧张的生产。
    樟市公社为了实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进，进一步贯彻工业和农业同时并举、自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针，从1月上旬开始，各条生产战线都配足人马，鼓足干劲，掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众大闹生产的热潮。二十多天来，这个公社以深翻积肥为中心的备耕生产，取得了显著的成绩。截至1月28日，一共积集了各种肥料五千七百三十六万担，按早、中造水稻种植面积平均计算，每亩有肥料一千八百五十担。其中，精肥平均每亩有八百三十七担。深翻改土深度达一尺以上的田有一万六千六百多亩，熏土一千九百亩。在积肥深翻中结合修好小型水利五百一十五宗，新筑牛车路、手推车路共二千五百八十多条。挑选良种四百多万斤的工作也已经基本完成。这几天来，春播春耕也开始了。六百多头耕牛和六百多个使牛手，在经过深翻的一片平坦的田野上，忙碌地进行犁田耙田。目前全社已经浸种三万一千多斤，播种二万一千多斤，耙田五百多亩，整好种植经济作物的土地一千多亩，种下旱熟作物五百多亩。公社的土地上出现了春草未绿秧先绿的景象。
    这个公社工业生产密锣紧鼓的情形也不下于农业。按照今年的规划要兴建的二十四个项目、四十三个厂房，目前除萤石、纤维板厂、皮革厂三项未动工外，其他二十一项正在动工，有的已经边建边生产。支援农业生产的磷肥厂、石灰厂、颗粒肥料厂、农具修配加工厂等已经生产了磷肥一万五千多吨、颗粒肥二万斤，赶制出马车四辆、手推车四百部、切薯机十五台、水田耙三十张、播种机一台、牛车三百七十部，修好手推车和牛车三千五百多部。砖瓦厂、伐木场、炼铁厂、挖煤厂也都投入正常生产。
    最近，樟市公社的副业生产和多种经营也在不断发展。仅在1月份的头二十四天中，就出售了木柴一百二十万斤，蔬菜一万一千多斤，三鸟六百五十多只，生猪一百八十多头。公社为了今年能够更好更多更快地发展副业生产，除积极采购猪苗及三鸟种苗外，还严禁宰杀母鸡母鸭母猪，并且建立一个鱼苗繁殖场，大搞鱼苗繁殖工作。
    樟市公社在整社中，进一步加强了劳动管理，调整了工资级别，实行了生产责任制，根据工农业生产的需要，合理安排了劳动力。现在，这个社已经实行了定额管理制度，公社各个管理区、生产队实行了五包（即包成本、指标、面积、措施、工资）、六定（定时间、质量、任务、地点、领导、人员）和一竞一评一奖的制度，做到人人有责，个个有任务，社员的积极性空前高涨。在加强劳动管理时，这个公社一方面大力挖劳动潜力、精简后勤人员；一方面又按工业、农业、多种经营和后勤工作的需要，合理安排了劳动力，组织了专业队伍。此外，公社各级干部发扬带头苦干、参加生产、领导生产的作风，对开展生产运动起了很好的作用。
