Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, February 17th: Hunan Province is vigorously building ships and opening rivers to develop water transport. This year, the province plans to open 6,000 kilometers of sailing boat waterways, repair 5,000 kilometers of waterways, open 4,000 kilometers of motorized sailing boat waterways, and make 50,000 to 100,000 kilometers of canals navigable. It also plans to build 30,000 wooden sailing boats of one to three tons for agricultural use and develop 100,000 tons of specialized transport ships.

Hunan Province has the four major water systems of Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li rivers running through it, with a total of 842 large and small rivers, totaling more than 32,000 kilometers in length. There are also many mountain streams and small rivers, providing good conditions for vigorous development of water transport. At the beginning of last year, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the policy of "unified planning, comprehensive management, and comprehensive utilization of water resources" to vigorously develop water transport. Within one year, more than 6,000 kilometers of new sailing boat waterways have been opened, 9,497 kilometers of sailing boat waterways have been repaired, and the total mileage of navigable natural rivers has reached more than 17,000 kilometers, accounting for 54% of the total river length, an increase of 64.6% compared with 1957. The mileage of navigable irrigation canals has reached 20,000 kilometers, and 95 counties and cities in the province can be navigated. This has played a considerable role in promoting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

In order to further develop water transport, the Hunan Provincial Committee requires party committees at all levels to first launch mass movements this year, implement the policy of walking on two legs, grasp both steamship transportation and sailing boat transportation, and focus on sailing boat transportation. It is also necessary to implement the principle of "overall arrangement and comprehensive utilization," which should not only facilitate navigation, but also facilitate irrigation and power generation, and gradually realize river networkization.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 17th: Since Liaoning Province launched a mass movement of the whole party and the entire people to develop transportation in January, transportation efficiency has significantly improved.

At present, the turnaround time of railway freight cars has generally been shortened. In some stations, the time for one operation of vehicles in mid-January and late January was shortened by 15 hours compared with early January. The time for one operation of vehicles in Benxi, Beipiao, Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan, Fuxin, Xinqiu and other stations has reached or exceeded the leap forward target. The turnover of vehicles has been greatly accelerated. The average daily loading volume of the province's railway department in mid-January and late January was more than 1,130 vehicles more than in early January; in particular, the loading volume of coal was more than 870 vehicles more than in early January. The transportation efficiency of highways and shipping has also been improved. From a regional perspective, Benxi and Beipiao counties and cities have achieved the most outstanding results. The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee have respectively issued transportation red flags to these two counties and cities.

    全党全民大办交通水陆运输同时跃进
    湖南
    据新华社长沙17日电　湖南省大力造船开河，发展水上运输。今年，全省计划开辟帆船航道六千公里，整修航道五千公里，开辟机帆船航道四千公里，渠道通航五万至十万公里，新造农业用的一至三吨木帆船三万只，发展专业运输船十万吨。
    湖南省湘、资、沅、澧四大水系贯穿全省，大小河流共有八百四十二条，总长三万二千多公里，还有许多山溪小河，有着大力发展水运事业的良好条件。中共湖南省委在去年初提出“统一规划、全面治理、综合利用水利资源”的方针，大搞水运。一年内，已开辟新帆船航道六千多公里，整修帆船航道九千四百九十七公里，自然河流通航总里程达到一万七千多公里，为河道总长的54％，比1957年增加64.6％，利用灌溉渠道通航的里程达到二万公里，全省九十五个县、市都能通航。这对支援工农业生产大跃进，起了相当大的促进作用。
    为了进一步发展水运事业，湖南省委要求各级党委今年首先要大搞群众运动，贯彻两条腿走路的方针，一面抓轮船运输，一面抓帆船运输，并以帆船运输为主。并要贯彻“全面安排、综合利用”的原则，既要有利于通航，又要便于灌溉、发电，逐步实现河网化。
    辽宁
    据新华社沈阳17日电　辽宁省自1月份展开全党全民办交通运输的群众运动以来，运输效率显著提高。
    现在，铁路货车车辆停留时间普遍缩短，有的车站1月中、下旬的车辆一次作业时间，就比上旬缩短十五小时。本溪、北票、沈阳、大连、鞍山、阜新、新丘等车站的车辆一次作业时间，都已达到或超过跃进指标。车辆周转大大加速，全省铁路部门1月中、下旬每天平均装车量，比上旬多一千一百三十多车；特别是煤炭的装车量，每天比上旬多八百七十多车。公路和航运的运输效率也有提高。从地区来看，本溪和北票两县市成绩最为突出，中共辽宁省委和省人民委员会已分别以交通运输红旗发给这两个县市。
