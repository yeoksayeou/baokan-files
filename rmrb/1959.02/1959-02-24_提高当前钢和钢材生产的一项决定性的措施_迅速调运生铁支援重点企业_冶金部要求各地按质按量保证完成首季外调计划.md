Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry's telephone conference on the transfer of pig iron and steel, held on the 21st, determined that all provinces, regions, and steel enterprises must immediately mobilize. In accordance with the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard" and "external before internal," they must transfer qualified pig iron according to the state plan to ensure the iron needed by key national steel enterprises and machinery equipment manufacturing.

According to the state plan, pig iron should be transferred from nineteen provinces, autonomous regions, and steel enterprises in the first quarter of this year to support key steel plants and departments such as machinery, railways, and coal. However, so far, the plans for external transfer of pig iron have been better completed by units such as Fujian, Anhui, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, and the Benxi Iron and Steel Company. The conference pointed out that completing the steel production plans for February and March is key to completing the first quarter's plan, and the first quarter's steel production plan is the foundation of this year's steel plan. Transferring pig iron to support key enterprises in steelmaking and machinery industrial departments in casting is a decisive measure to rapidly improve current steel and steel production.

In order to guarantee the completion of the pig iron external transfer plan in terms of quality and quantity, the conference required all provinces and autonomous regions to pay attention to the following points:

One, take various measures to ensure the completion of the state-stipulated first quarter's pig iron external transfer plan before the end of March.

Two, the pig iron of each province and autonomous region should be used and distributed centrally to ensure key needs and external transfer according to plan. There are two key points to ensure: one is the pig iron used for steelmaking in key national steel enterprises, especially large steel enterprises; the other is the pig iron needed for heavy machinery, mining, coking, coal washing, locomotive manufacturing.

Three, tightly grasp the raw material production and technical operation of small blast furnaces, and expand the operating rate of small blast furnaces. This is the key to completing the current steel production and pig iron transfer plan.

Four, strengthen the organization of the transfer of pig iron and other steel production raw materials.

The conference announced the specific targets for the external transfer of pig iron by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry for nineteen provinces, autonomous regions, and enterprises before the end of February, requiring all provinces, autonomous regions, and enterprises to immediately take measures to ensure completion. These nineteen units are: Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, Longyan Iron and Steel Company, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Benxi Iron and Steel Company, and Shanxi, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Sichuan, and Guizhou.

When studying the current steel transfer problem, the conference decided that the steel transferred nationwide before the end of February should be used centrally. The principle is to prioritize key projects and the manufacturing of important equipment such as coking, coal washing, rolling mills, locomotives, power stations, and chemicals. To this end, steel enterprises in Anshan, Taiyuan, Shanghai, Chongqing, Daye, Benxi, Shenyang, Dalian and other places are required to complete the steel transfer plan in accordance with this principle.

    提高当前钢和钢材生产的一项决定性的措施
    迅速调运生铁支援重点企业
    冶金部要求各地按质按量保证完成首季外调计划
    新华社23日讯　冶金工业部21日举行的调运生铁、钢材电话会议确定，各省、区和钢铁企业要立即动员起来，根据“全国一盘棋”和“先外后内”的精神，按照国家计划调出合格的生铁，以保证全国各重点钢铁企业和机械设备制造所需的用铁。
    国家计划规定，今年第一季度，要从十九个省、自治区和钢铁企业调出生铁，支援重点钢厂和机械、铁道、煤炭等部门。但是到目前为止，除福建、安徽、浙江、四川和石景山钢铁公司、本溪钢铁公司等单位外调生铁的计划完成得较好以外，其他一些地区外调生铁的计划完成得不够好。会议指出，完成2、3月份的钢铁生产计划是完成第一季度计划的关键，第一季度的钢铁生产计划是今年钢铁计划的基础。而调运生铁支援重点企业炼钢和机械工业部门铸造，是迅速提高当前钢和钢材生产的决定性的措施。
    为了保证按质按量地完成生铁外调计划，会议要求各省、自治区注意以下各点：
    一、采取各种措施，在3月底以前保证完成国家规定的第一季度外调生铁计划。
    二、各省、自治区的生铁，要集中使用和集中分配，以便确保重点需要，确保按计划外调。确保的重点有二：一是全国各重点钢铁企业，特别是大型钢铁企业炼钢用的生铁；另一是重型机械、矿山、炼焦、洗煤、机车制造所需要的生铁。
    三、抓紧小高炉的原材料生产和技术操作，扩大小高炉的开工生产率，这是完成当前钢铁生产和调运生铁计划的关键。
    四、加强生铁和其他钢铁生产原料调运的组织工作。
    会议宣布了冶金工业部制定的全国十九个省、自治区和企业在2月底以前外调生铁的具体指标，要求各省、自治区和企业立即采取措施，保证完成。这十九个单位是：石景山钢铁公司、龙烟钢铁公司、鞍山钢铁公司、武汉钢铁公司、本溪钢铁公司和山西、河北、内蒙古、江西、浙江、安徽、福建、江苏、山东、湖北、湖南、河南、四川和贵州。
    会议在研究当前钢材调运问题时，决定2月下旬以前全国调运的钢材要集中使用。原则是优先保证重点工程和炼焦、洗煤、轧机、机车、电站、化工等重要设备的制造业。为此，要求鞍山、太原、上海、重庆、大冶、本溪、沈阳、大连等地的钢铁企业，按照这个原则完成钢材调运计划。（附图片）
