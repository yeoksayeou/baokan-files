Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: The Ministry of Light Industry held a National Light Industry Bureau Directors' Meeting from February 16th to 22nd to specifically arrange the production plans for various sectors of light industry this year.

The meeting believed that guaranteeing the supply of raw materials is a crucial key to completing this year's light industry production tasks. This year, a technical revolution movement centered on saving raw materials, using substitutes, and increasing labor productivity must be widely carried out in the light industry system. We must use a three-pronged approach of increasing revenue, reducing expenditure, and strengthening cooperation to accelerate the production of raw materials and conserve their use in every possible way. The specific measures are: First, light industry bureaus in all provinces and cities are required to tightly grasp industries, products, and regions, and to uniformly allocate this year's raw materials to ensure key areas are prioritized while also considering general needs. Production of products urgently needed in the market should be arranged first, ensuring that raw materials allocated to light industry by the state are not used for other purposes. Agricultural products are the main source of raw materials for light industry. Light industry departments in various regions are required to cooperate with relevant departments to quickly purchase and promptly transport them. Second, vigorously develop diversified operations, establish a large number of satellite factories closely related to the production of the main factory, and establish chemical raw material bases, such as establishing electrolytic alkali production and bleaching powder workshops in qualified paper mills. Third, each industry should focus on major products, actively carry out the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, organize waste product recycling, find substitutes, and strictly control and reduce the consumption quotas of raw materials. For example, caustic soda is one of the urgently needed raw materials for light industry. In addition to the supply from the chemical industry sector, the country is rich in native alkali resources, which can be widely exploited and utilized to give full play to the role of native alkali. Fourth, implement the idea of "the whole country as one chessboard," strengthen cooperation, restore original cooperative relationships, establish new cooperative relationships, organize raw material production, and provide mutual support.

In order to tap the potential of existing enterprises and improve labor productivity, all regions should systematically summarize and conscientiously promote existing key technological innovations and advanced experiences. The meeting requested that factories above the county level in the ceramics, enamel, glass, leather, and rubber shoe industries should make full use of the advanced experiences of 1958, use non-metallic materials as much as possible, and basically achieve mechanization within this year.

The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of people's communes running industries on a large scale, and light industry departments must take on the task of helping people's communes run industries.

    开源节流保证原材料供应
    全国轻工业厅局长会议安排今年生产计划
    据新华社26日讯　轻工业部在2月16日到22日召开全国轻工业厅局长会议，具体安排了今年轻工业各行业的生产计划。
    会议认为，保证原材料的供应是完成今年轻工业生产任务的重要关键。今年必须在轻工业系统广泛开展一个以节约原材料、使用代用品、提高劳动生产率为中心的技术革命运动，以开源、节流、协作三管齐下的办法，千方百计地加紧原材料生产，和节约使用原材料。具体措施是：一、要求各省市轻工业厅、局，紧紧地抓行业、抓产品、抓地区，统一调配今年的原材料，以保证重点，照顾一般，先安排市场上急需产品的生产，保证国家分配给轻工业的原材料不作他用。农产品是轻工业原料的主要来源，要求各地轻工业部门配合有关部门迅速收购，及时调运。二、大量发展多种经营，大办一些与本厂生产有密切联系的卫星厂，建立化工原料基地，如在有条件的纸厂建立电解法制烧碱与漂粉车间等。三、各行业以主要产品为主，积极开展原材料的综合利用，组织废品回收，寻找代用品，严格控制和降低原材料的消耗定额。如烧碱是轻工业急需的原料之一，除了由化工部门供应外，全国各地土碱资源丰富，可以广泛挖掘采用，充分发挥土碱的作用。四、贯彻“全国一盘棋”思想，加强协作，恢复原有协作关系，建立新的协作关系，组织原料生产，互相支援。
    为了挖掘现有企业的潜力，提高劳动生产率，各地应系统地总结和认真推广已有的带关键性的技术创造和先进经验。会议要求陶瓷、搪瓷、玻璃、制革、胶鞋工业中县以上的工厂，要充分利用1958年的先进经验，尽量使用非金属材料，在今年内基本上实现机械化。
    会议指出，必须继续贯彻人民公社大办工业的方针，轻工业部门必须担负起帮助人民公社办工业的任务。
