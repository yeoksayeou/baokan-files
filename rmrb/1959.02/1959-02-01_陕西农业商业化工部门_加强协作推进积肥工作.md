Shaanxi Province's relevant departments are further strengthening collaboration to promote the province's manure collection and fertilizer production campaign.

Recently, at a provincial fertilizer work conference jointly convened by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Department of Commerce, and the Chemical Industry Bureau, the following decisions were made regarding the division of labor and collaboration: The industrial department is responsible for fertilizer resource exploration, research on production methods, and guidance on production techniques; the commercial department is responsible for the supply of materials, tools, and equipment, and the promotion of finished products; the agricultural department is mainly responsible for fertilization techniques, fertilizer efficiency identification, and field comparison tests. In response to the fact that Shaanxi Province's soil needs nitrogen fertilizer but nitrogen fertilizer is lacking, each department, according to its own situation, is responsible for solving the problem of nitrogen fertilizer production through division of labor and collaboration. After research by relevant units, the technical problems of indigenous coking and recovering ammonia water from coal smoke from other sources have been basically solved, and the Department of Commerce is responsible for promoting it; in order to open up more avenues for nitrogen fertilizer production, the Chemical Industry Bureau is responsible for solving the problem of extracting nitrogen from the waste steam of oxygen plants; the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences is researching and solving the technical problems of indigenous production of lime nitrogen. In addition, relevant departments have also made division of labor and collaboration in areas such as pig raising for manure collection, planting green manure, and manufacturing indigenous chemical fertilizers.

Currently, relevant departments are carrying out various tasks for manure collection and fertilizer production. In addition to actively adjusting green manure seeds in various counties in the province, the Department of Commerce has also sent people to Hunan, Gansu, and other provinces to purchase seeds, and has signed contracts with factories run by local schools to manufacture 1,000 tons of indigenous chemical fertilizer. The Zhouzhi County Commerce Bureau is assisting the county and various communes in establishing fertilizer plants, cooperating with the grain department to solve the problem of green manure seeds, and sending people to Shenyang to purchase raw materials needed for manufacturing bacterial fertilizer. The Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences has sent five people to help various communes plant green manure, and plans to send another group of people after the Spring Festival. The Chemical Industry Bureau is researching to train a group of indigenous chemical fertilizer testing personnel for various places. In addition to helping Chang'an County establish a potash fertilizer plant and helping the original Ningxia and Nanzheng establish phosphate fertilizer plants, continuing to look for mineral fertilizer to expand fertilizer sources, it will also study the comprehensive utilization of phosphate rock, potash feldspar, pyrite, coal mines, and agricultural product stalks and wild fibers to increase fertilizer production. The Chemical Industry Bureau has also sent three work groups to help Yan'an, Hanzhong, Baoji and other places establish chemical fertilizer factories.

Last year, the relevant departments in Shaanxi Province adopted the method of division of labor and collaboration in manure collection and fertilizer production and did a lot of work. In the vigorous campaign of indigenous chemical fertilizers, relevant units jointly summarized the experience of the masses in Lantian and other counties in manufacturing indigenous chemical fertilizers and steaming fertilizer and smoking fertilizer, and jointly held a potassium feldspar comprehensive factory and a potassium feldspar comprehensive utilization training class with Chang'an, Zhouzhi and other five counties. The Department of Commerce also cooperated with relevant units to cultivate a large number of strains of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and other bacteria, and held bacterial fertilizer training classes to solve the technical, equipment and raw material problems for manufacturing bacterial fertilizer throughout the province. The Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences set up four points in Suide, the original Wugong, etc., and made comparison demonstrations in forty counties to promote the planting of green manure; it also designated special personnel to focus on studying the accumulation, storage, and application of farm manure. The Chemical Industry Bureau has also done a lot of work in helping to find mineral fertilizer resources and solve technical problems in the production of indigenous chemical fertilizers.

    加强协作推进积肥工作
    据新华社西安30日电　陕西省有关部门进一步加强协作，推动全省积肥、造肥运动。
    最近，在农林厅、商业厅和化工局联合召开的全省肥料工作会议上，对分工协作，作了下述决定：工业部门负责肥料资源勘察、生产方法的研究和生产技术的指导工作；商业部门负责物资、工具、设备的供应和成品的推销工作；农业部门主要担任施肥技术、肥效鉴定和田间对比试验等工作。针对陕西省土壤需要氮肥而氮肥缺乏的情况，各部门按照本身情况，分工协作共同负责解决氮肥的生产问题。经过有关单位研究，目前土法炼焦和从其他方面的煤烟中回收氨水的技术问题已经基本上解决，由商业厅负责推广；为了开辟更多的氮肥生产门径，化工局负责解决从氧气厂的废汽中提取氮；中国农业科学院陕西分院研究解决土法制造石灰氮的技术问题。此外，在养猪积肥、种植绿肥和制造土化肥等方面，有关部门也都作了分工协作。
    目前，有关部门都为积肥、制肥进行各种工作。商业厅除在省内各县积极进行绿肥种子的调整外，还派人到湖南、甘肃等省购买种子，和当地各学校办的工厂签订了制造一千吨土化肥的合同。盩厔县商业局正协助县和各公社建立肥料厂，和粮食部门协作解决绿肥种子问题，并派人到沈阳去购买制造菌肥所需的原料。中国农业科学院陕西分院已派了五个人帮助各公社种植绿肥，春节后，计划再派一批人下去。化工局正在研究为各地培养一批土化肥的化验人员，除正在帮助长安县建立钾肥厂和帮助原宁陕、南郑建立磷肥厂，继续寻找矿肥扩大肥源外，还要研究磷灰石矿、钾长石矿、硫铁矿、煤矿和农产品禾秸、野生纤维的综合利用，以增产肥料。化工局还派了三个工作组帮助延安、汉中、宝鸡等地建立化学肥料工厂。
    陕西省有关部门去年在积肥、造肥当中，就采取分工协作的办法，作了很多工作。在大搞土化肥运动中，有关单位共同协作总结了蓝田等县群众制造土化肥和蒸肥、熏肥的经验，联合长安、盩厔等五个县共同举办了钾长石综合工厂和一个钾长石综合利用的训练班。商业厅还和有关单位协作培养了大批固氮菌等的菌种，举办细菌肥料训练班，解决了全省各地制造菌肥的技术、设备和原料的问题。中国农业科学院陕西分院在绥德、原武功等地设了四个点，又在四十个县作了对比示范推动绿肥的种植；还指定专人，集中精力研究了农家肥料的积攒、保管、施用问题。化工局也在帮助寻找矿肥资源和解决土化肥生产技术问题上，作了许多工作。
