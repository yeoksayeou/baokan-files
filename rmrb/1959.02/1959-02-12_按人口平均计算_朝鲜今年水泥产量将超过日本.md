Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th: Kim Il, First Vice-Premier of the North Korean Cabinet, said at the completion ceremony of the "February 8th Madong Cement Factory" on the 8th that workers at North Korea's cement plants are striving to produce three million tons of cement this year, a figure that will be 2.5 times North Korea's cement production last year. He also said that in the next few years, North Korea will increase its annual cement production to five million tons.

	Calculated on a per capita basis, North Korea's annual production of three million tons of cement will allow each person to have 300 kilograms of cement, which far exceeds Japan's per capita cement production.

	Kim Il said that this modern cement factory with an annual output of 400,000 tons, newly built in North Korea with Soviet assistance after the war, will increase its production capacity to one million tons per year. He said that in order to develop cement production, North Korea, while making full use of existing production equipment and building large factories, has also started building many small cement factories in various places since last year.

	Kim Il expressed his gratitude to the Soviet Union for its assistance to the North Korean people, saying that the completion of this factory once again demonstrates the friendship between the North Korean and Soviet peoples. The North Korean people will strive to continuously strengthen the friendly unity between themselves and the Soviet people.

    按人口平均计算
    朝鲜今年水泥产量将超过日本
    新华社平壤9日电　朝鲜内阁第一副首相金一8日在“二·八马洞水泥工厂”的竣工仪式上说，朝鲜各水泥厂的工人正在为争取在今年内生产三百万吨水泥而斗争，这个数字将达到朝鲜去年水泥产量的2.5倍。他还说，在最近几年内，朝鲜将使它的水泥年产量达到五百万吨。
    按人口平均计算，朝鲜北部年产三百万吨水泥，将使每人可分得水泥三百公斤，这远远超过日本按人口平均的水泥产量。
    金一说，朝鲜战后在苏联援助下新建的这座现代化的年产四十万吨的水泥工厂将要把它的生产能力提高到年产一百万吨。他说，为了发展水泥生产，朝鲜北部在充分利用现有的生产设备和建设大厂的同时，还从去年开始在各地建设了许多小型水泥工厂。
    金一对苏联给予朝鲜人民的援助表示感谢，他说，这个工厂的建成再次显示了朝苏两国人民的友谊。朝鲜人民将为不断加强同苏联人民之间的友好团结而努力。
