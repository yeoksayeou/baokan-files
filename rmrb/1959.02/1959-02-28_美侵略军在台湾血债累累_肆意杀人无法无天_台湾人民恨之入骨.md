Xinhua News Agency, February 27th, Taipei dispatch: Taiwan recently experienced the tragedy of an American soldier running over and killing a Kuomintang legislator with his car. On the evening of February 23rd, Kuomintang legislator Ma Xiaojun and his wife, Fang Fusheng, were riding home together in a rickshaw in Taipei when they were hit by a military vehicle driven by Sergeant Drummz of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group on Nanjing East Road. The rickshaw was smashed, and Ma Xiaojun was seriously injured. He was rescued by passersby and sent to Taiwan University Hospital, where he died shortly after. His wife, Fang Fusheng, suffered severe head injuries and a broken shoulder, and is currently in the hospital in critical condition. The rickshaw puller's leg was injured. Ma Xiaojun was 77 years old, from Rong County, Guangxi, and had served as the "Chief Advisor of the Ministry of Military Affairs" in Chiang Kai-shek's group.

The tragic death of Ma Xiaojun is just one of the thousands of traffic accidents caused by the rampaging American aggressor troops in Taiwan. Just over two months ago, a newly married couple in Taipei was riding home in a rickshaw after seeing a movie when they were run over by a car driven by Hanson, a soldier from the U.S. 13th Air Force. The 17-year-old bride, Chen Liangxiao, was killed instantly, and the groom, Zhang Xinjun, in his twenties, and the rickshaw puller were seriously injured. After causing the accident, the American murderer Hanson not only did not stop, but instead accelerated and fled at high speed. However, many citizens noted the license plate number, and the Taipei police authorities received many reports of the American military vehicle's number and requests for the murderer to be punished. After negotiations, the U.S. 13th Air Force had to admit that its subordinate Hanson had driven the car that killed the person. However, the American Air Force murderer Hanson is still at large. Furthermore, the U.S. military refuses to compensate the victim's family for their losses.

Xinhua News Agency, February 27th, Taipei dispatch: The people of Taiwan deeply hate the American aggressors. In Kaohsiung Port, which has been occupied by the United States as a naval base, it is very difficult for members of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group to hire a maid. This is according to recent reports in the Taiwanese press.

The Tainan "Success Evening News" published a report on February 19th under the headline "Difficult to Hire Help Despite Money, American Advisors Seek Assistance," stating that the U.S. military advisory group stationed in Kaohsiung "is racking their brains over the problem of hiring maids." They collectively appointed Colonel Bao Yide, the head of the Naval Section of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan, to request a solution from the Chiang Kai-shek group's Kaohsiung Municipal Government. Bao Yide wrote a letter to Chen Wuzhang, the mayor of the Chiang Kai-shek group's Kaohsiung City, explaining that the U.S. military personnel in Kaohsiung could not hire maids and requesting Chen Wuzhang to "resolve this difficulty."

The Taipei "United Daily News" also reported that recently in Kaohsiung, "American military dependents have spent much time and effort searching for help," but despite being "wealthy foreign customers," very few people are willing to work for them, making the Americans "feel overwhelmed and seeking help from the local government, which shows the seriousness of the problem."

American aggressors in Taiwan run rampant and commit all kinds of evil deeds. The people of Taiwan's hatred for them is also deepening. According to the Kaohsiung "China Evening News," according to statistics released by the Foreign Affairs Office of the Chiang Kai-shek group's Kaohsiung City Police Department, in the past year, American aggressors committed 216 cases in Kaohsiung City, including 62 traffic accidents, 21 cases of killing and injuring Chinese people, 42 cases of violating public order, and other cases of international smuggling, molesting women, undermining public morals, robbery, and theft. These 200-plus cases are only the incidents that the police department has on record. There are also many atrocities committed by the U.S. military that the citizens of Kaohsiung did not report to avoid trouble. Several shocking atrocities by the U.S. military occurred in Taiwan last year, one of which was the case of Thomas, a member of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group, tying his maid Chen Hua to a sofa in his residence, pouring gasoline on her, and burning her alive. After this atrocity spread throughout Taiwan, it became very difficult for the families of U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan to hire maids.

At the same time, news reports say that because American soldiers stationed in the Kaohsiung and Tainan areas are often punished by Taiwanese patriots, anti-American slogans such as "Yankee Go Home!" are frequently found in this area. Therefore, at present, American soldiers do not dare to stray far from the city and barracks unless they are in groups.

    美侵略军在台湾血债累累
    肆意杀人无法无天　台湾人民恨之入骨
    新华社27日讯　台北消息：台湾最近发生美国士兵驾车撞死一名国民党立法委员的惨剧。23日晚上，台湾国民党立法委员马晓军和他的妻子方福生，在台北市内同乘一辆三轮车回家，经过南京东路时，被美国军事援助顾问团上士德鲁姆兹驾驶军车撞翻。三轮车被撞烂，马晓军受重伤，被途人抢救送往台湾大学医院不久即毙命。其妻方福生头部受重伤，肩骨折断，现在在医院未脱离危险期。三轮车工人的腿部受伤。马晓军今年七十七岁，广西容县人，曾任蒋介石集团的“军政部主任参事”等职。
    马晓军惨死只是横行霸道的美国侵略军在台湾犯下数以千计的车祸事件之一。两个多月前，台北市即曾发生一对新婚夫妇看电影后乘三轮车回家时，被美国第十三航空队士兵汉森驾车撞翻的惨案。十七岁的新娘陈良笑当场惨死，二十多岁的新郎张新钧和三轮车工人都受重伤。美军凶手汉森肇祸后，不仅不下车，反而把汽车加大油门飞速逃走，但被许多市民把车牌记下，台北警察当局接到了许多报告闯祸美军车号和要求惩凶的电话和信件。经过交涉，美国第十三航空队才不得不承认其部属汉森曾驾车杀人。但是，至今美国空军杀人凶手汉森仍然逍遥法外。美军方面并且拒绝给受害家属赔偿损失。
    新华社27日讯　台北消息：台湾人民对美国侵略者十分痛恨，在被美国霸占为海军基地的高雄港，美国军事援助顾问团人员想雇用一个女佣人也十分困难。这是台湾报纸最近透露的消息。
    台南市“成功晚报”在2月19日以“有钱难雇工，美顾问求援”为标题刊登的消息说，驻在高雄市的美军顾问团人员“正在为雇请佣人问题而大伤脑筋”，他们公推美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团海军组组长包义德上校向蒋介石集团高雄市政府请求解决。包义德写了一封信给蒋介石集团高雄市市长陈武璋，说明美军人员在高雄请不到佣人，要求陈武璋“解决此一困难”。
    台北市“联合报”也报道说，最近高雄“美军眷属旷日费时四出寻觅雇工”，尽管她们是“阔绰多金的洋客”，但极少有人愿意替她们做工，使美国人“感到应付维艰而求助于地方政府，足见这一问题的严重性了”。
    美国侵略人员在台湾横行霸道，无恶不作，台湾人民对他们的仇恨也日益加深。据高雄“中国晚报”报道，根据蒋介石集团高雄市警察局外事室发表的统计，在去年一年内，美国侵略人员在高雄市犯案二百一十六件，其中包括汽车闯祸案六十二件，杀死和伤害中国人案二十一件，违反治安案四十二件，其他为国际走私、调戏妇女、妨害风化、抢掠盗窃等等案件。这二百多宗只是警察局有案可查的事件。还有许多美军的暴行，高雄市民为了免得招惹麻烦而没有报案。台湾去年曾发生几件轰动一时的美军暴行，其中一件是美军顾问团人员汤姆斯在住宅中把女佣人陈花绑在沙发椅上，浇上汽油活活烧死。这一件暴行传遍台湾后，侵台美军眷属从此很难雇到女佣人了。
    同时有消息说，由于驻在高雄、台南一带的美国兵常常受到台湾爱国者的惩罚。这一地区还常常发现“美国鬼子滚出去”等反美标语。因此，目前美国兵除非成群结队，都不敢远离市区和营房。
