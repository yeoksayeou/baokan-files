Self-Study and Self-Teaching: A Good Way to Train Instructors
Propaganda Department of the CPC Tianjin Hexi District Committee
    Within a short few months, more than 70,000 people in our district have participated in the mass movement to study theory. How to continuously consolidate and improve on the basis of popularization has become an important issue we currently face.
    A crucial step in consolidation and improvement lies in organizing and training a large number of theoretical instructors. There are two ways to solve the problem of theoretical instructors: one is to rely on external assistance, inviting others to speak, or relying on a few leading cadres within the unit. This cannot fundamentally solve the problem, because inviting external assistance is not always possible, and moreover, they are not familiar with the situation of the masses, making it difficult to lecture. Relying solely on lectures from leading cadres within the unit also poses problems. Take our district's Steel Rolling Mill No. 1 as an example. The factory has nearly 4,000 employees, workshops are dispersed, rest days differ, and there are many work shifts, making it difficult to lecture during work hours. Therefore, inviting external assistance and relying on lectures from a few leading cadres can only solve the immediate problem and is not a long-term solution. Another method is to implement the mass line, rely on our own efforts, not only having people within the factory lecture, but also having people lecture within the workshops—in short, letting the workers themselves take the stage. This requires training a group of worker instructors. We have adopted the latter approach, and in less than a month, we have established a lecturing team of nearly a thousand people.
    Our district's lecturing team is divided into systems: a worker lecturing team, a farmer lecturing team (currently being prepared), a shop assistant lecturing team, and a street lecturing team. The members participating in the lecturing team are very broad, including workshop Party branch secretaries, workshop directors, labor union chairmen, and production workers, as well as street cadres, police officers, shop managers, shop assistants, and tricycle workers. The worker lecturing team primarily consists of veteran workers, labor models, activists, and Party members. Why were these comrades selected as instructors? Because these comrades are mostly the backbone of the masses, have an urgent desire to learn, and are familiar with production and the situation of the masses, making them adept at explaining the principles of communism.
    Our district's lecturing team mainly determines the teaching content based on the central tasks of the Party. During the communist education movement, four lessons have been taught: (1) Communism is our future; (2) Fighting to accelerate socialist construction; (3) On bourgeois rights; (4) On people's communes. After the Communiqué and Resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee were published, we also combined them with the previous ideological situation of the masses and tentatively proposed the following topics: (1) On the policy of walking on two legs; (2) Striving to fulfill the great tasks of 1959; (3) Correctly understanding the theory of continuous revolution and the stages of revolutionary development; (4) Our current task is to accelerate socialist construction; (5) Combining revolutionary vigor with scientific analysis, etc. In teaching these topics, we try to use philosophical principles for analysis.
    The activity method of the lecturing team is "learn before teaching" and "learn while teaching." In their studies, they generally adopt a method that combines discussion, lesson preparation, and research on practical problems. This not only allows them to pool their wisdom and learn well themselves, but also improves the quality of lesson preparation and saves lesson preparation time.
    Currently, many units in our district have established lecturing teams at the factory level and street level, ranging from three or five people to as many as seventy or eighty people. Some factories have already formed a complete system of organizing theoretical education for the masses. For example, Cotton Textile Factory No. 4 has established a factory-level amateur Marxism-Leninism College and formed six lecturing teams according to workshop, each team consisting of about ten people, responsible for the theoretical education of the employees in their respective workshops. Steel Rolling Mill No. 1 has also established a Marxism-Leninism Education and Research Office, and each workshop and production team has also established its own Marxism-Leninism teaching and research group. The head of the workshop teaching and research group is also a member of the factory-level Marxism-Leninism Education and Research Office, and the head of the production team is also a member of the workshop teaching and research group, forming a three-ring chain of theoretical education from the factory level to the workshop and from the workshop to the team. This further expands the theoretical ranks and, organizationally, tightly binds learning and production together, fundamentally solving the contradiction between learning and production, and creating important conditions for the combination of theoretical popularization and improvement, bringing a lively and vibrant new situation to theoretical work.
    Our district's lecturing team has only been established recently, but its activities have greatly promoted the study of theory among the masses throughout the district. There are the following gains:
    First, because backbone elements among the workers and working people have been mobilized to participate in the lecturing team, this has not only improved the theoretical level of these comrades, but has also played a significant role in popularizing and consolidating the mass study of philosophy. For example, the number of people originally studying philosophy was only 42,000 (including workers, shop assistants, and citizens), but after the lecturing team was established, it immediately increased to over 70,000. More than 3,000 tricycle workers, who had rarely studied politics, also actively participated in the study of philosophy. In the past, the study of philosophy in some factories was conducted by a few leading cadres of the factory, but it stopped when work became busy. After the lecturing team was established, it resumed. These facts all show that establishing a lecturing team to solve the problem of instructors is one of the key factors in consolidating and improving the mass movement to study theory.
    Second, because the content of the lectures comes from production and the actual lives of the masses, their language comes from the worker-peasant masses, and their class nature and purpose are also relatively clear, the lectures are lively, persuasive, and easy for the masses to listen to and accept. The results in production are also significant. For example, the No. 1 Branch of the Dyeing Company produced socks, but was 200 dozen short of completing its daily task. After studying the lesson "Socialism is Good, Communism is Even Better," they exceeded their daily task by 100 dozen.
    Third, a large number of backbone elements have been trained, and their theoretical level, policy level, and ideological level have been improved. After studying and lecturing, many comrades have learned to handle problems and improved their working methods. For example, a workshop deputy director at the Internal Combustion Engine Parts Factory, after studying, lectured extensively on theory in the workshop, changing the backward face of the workshop. In the past two months, he has continuously won red flags and become an advanced workshop in the factory. A workshop director at the Dyeing Company said, "Giving lectures has promoted my own learning and I have gained a lot," and "I didn't dare to speak in the past, but now I dare to speak."

    自学自讲，培养教员的一种好办法
    中共天津市河西区委宣传部
    我区群众学习理论的运动在短短的几个月内，全区参加学习的已有七万多人。如何在普及的基础上不断巩固和提高，已成为我们当前面临的一个重要问题。
    巩固和提高的重要一环在于组织和培养大批的理论教员。而解决理论教员问题，有两种办法：一是靠外援，请别人来讲，或是靠本单位的少数领导干部。这不能从根本上解决问题，因为，请外援一则不能经常，二则对群众情况不熟悉，讲起来有困难。光靠本单位领导干部讲也有问题。拿我区轧钢一厂来说，全厂职工近四千人，车间分散，公休日不同，加上劳动班次多，跟班讲也有困难。因此，请外援，靠少数领导干部讲课，只能解决燃眉之急，不是长久之计。另一种办法是贯彻群众路线，自力更生，不仅厂内自己讲，车间内也要自己讲，一句话，让工人自己上台讲。这就要求培养一批工人教员。我们采取了后一种办法，不到一个月，已经建立起来一支近千人的讲师团。
    我区的讲师团按系统分为：工人讲师团、农民讲师团（正在筹备）、店员讲师团和街道讲师团。参加讲师团的成员非常广泛，有车间支部书记、车间主任、工会主席和生产工人，有街道干部、民警，还有商店经理、店员和三轮工人。在工人讲师团里多是老工人、劳动模范、积极分子和党员。为什么挑选这些人当讲师呢？因为这些同志多是群众中的骨干，要求学习迫切，同时，他们熟悉生产和群众的情况，是善于讲解共产主义道理的人。
    我区讲师团主要是结合党的中心任务来确定教学内容。在共产主义教育运动中，已讲了四课：（1）共产主义是我们的前景；（2）为加速社会主义建设而战；（3）关于资产阶级法权；（4）关于人民公社。八届六中全会的公报和决议发表后，我们又结合群众前一段的思想情况，初步拟了以下几个题目：（1）关于两条腿走路的方针；（2）为完成1959年的伟大任务而奋斗；（3）正确认识不断革命论与革命发展阶段论；（4）我们当前的任务是加速社会主义建设；（5）革命干劲与科学分析相结合，等等。在讲授这些题目中，都尽量用哲学上的原理去分析。
    讲师团的活动方法是：“先学后讲”，“边学边讲”。他们在学习中，一般都采取讨论、备课和研究实际问题三结合的方法。这样做，既能集思广益，自己学好，又能提高备课质量，节省备课时间。
    目前，我区有许多单位成立了厂一级的、街一级的讲师团，少则三、五人组成，多则七、八十人组成。有的工厂已经形成了一整套向群众进行理论教育的组织。如棉纺四厂成立了厂级的业余马列主义学院，并按车间组成六个讲师团，每个团由十人左右组成，负责本车间职工的理论教育工作。轧钢一厂也成立了马列主义教育研究室，各车间和生产小组也都建立了自己的马列主义教研组，车间教研组的负责人也是厂级的马列主义教研室的成员，生产小组的负责人又是车间教研组的成员；形成了一个由厂级到车间、由车间到小组三环连锁的理论教育网。这就进一步扩大了理论队伍，并且从组织上把学习、生产紧紧地拧在一条绳上，基本上解决了学习与生产的矛盾，并且给理论的普及和提高相结合创造了重要条件，给理论工作带来了生动、活泼的新局面。
    我区的讲师团还成立不久，但它的活动，对全区群众学理论起了很大的推动作用。有以下几点收获：
    首先，由于发动了工人和劳动人民中的骨干分子参加讲师团，这不仅提高了这些同志的理论水平，而且对普及和巩固群众学哲学起了很大的作用。例如：原来学哲学的只有四万二千多人（包括工人、店员、市民），讲师团成立后马上增加到七万多人。一向很少学习政治的三千多名三轮工人，也积极地参加了哲学学习。过去有些厂的哲学学习是由厂的少数领导干部担任讲课，工作一紧张就停了下来，讲师团成立后，就又恢复起来了。这些事实都说明，成立讲师团来解决教员的问题，是群众学习理论运动得以巩固和提高的重要关键之一。
    其次，群众自学自讲，由于讲课的内容来自生产和群众生活实际，他们的语言来自工农大众，阶级性和目的性也较明确，因此，讲的生动活泼，说服力很强，群众爱听，容易接受。在生产上收效也很大。例如，漂染公司一分厂生产袜子，每天差二百打完不成任务，学习“社会主义好，共产主义更好”一课后，每天超额一百打完成任务。
    第三，培养了大批骨干，提高了他们的理论水平、政策水平和思想水平。许多同志经过学习和讲课，学会了处理问题，改进了工作方法。如内燃机制配厂有个车间副主任，经过学习，在车间大讲理论，改变了车间的落后面貌，两个月来，连续夺得了红旗，成为全厂的先进车间。漂染公司一个车间主任说：“通过讲课，促进了自己的学习，收获很大”，“过去不敢讲，现在敢讲了”。
