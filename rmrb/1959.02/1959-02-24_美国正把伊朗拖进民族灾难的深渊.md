    The United States is Plunging Iran into the Abyss of National Disaster
    Commentator of this newspaper

    U.S. government officials announced on February 16th that the United States is about to formally sign a bilateral military agreement with Iran. On the same day, the Iranian Foreign Minister made the same announcement.

    Negotiations between the United States and Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan, the remaining members of the Baghdad Pact, to conclude bilateral military agreements, have entered the final stage. The United States intends to strengthen its control over these countries through such agreements and further transform them into U.S. war bases. According to revealed materials, these agreements stipulate that U.S. troops can enter the territory of these countries, and the United States wants to establish more military bases on the territory of these countries. In this regard, the United States is particularly interested in establishing medium-range missile bases in Iran, Turkey, and other countries bordering the Soviet Union, targeting the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. According to the West German newspaper "Neue Rheinische Zeitung," U.S. medium-range rocket installations are currently being built in the Zagros Mountains region of Iran to form "an American missile ring around southern Soviet Union." Rockets will be transported there immediately after the U.S.-Iran military agreement is signed. It is not surprising that the West German newspaper knows about this secret project, because this newspaper also mentioned that West German engineers participated in the project construction along with the Americans. People see that Dulles, Murphy, and other U.S. officials have recently, in a propaganda campaign to shirk responsibility for the United States' insistence on the "Cold War," repeatedly professed the "peaceful intentions" of the United States, particularly denying the threatening nature of the hundreds of military bases the United States has established around socialist countries. However, facts speak louder than words. The United States not only continues to maintain but also brazenly increases these bases! The U.S. ruling clique is precisely adhering to the "brink of war" policy that endangers world peace.

    The U.S. conclusion of these bilateral military agreements on the remains of the Baghdad Pact is also aimed at the Arab national independence movement. Just as the United States once used Iraq under the old dynasty as a center for armed intervention in Syria, the United States is now turning Iran into a center for armed intervention and subversion against the Republic of Iraq. At the instigation of the United States, some pro-American members of the Iranian parliament and newspapers have recently openly advocated overthrowing the current Iraqi government. Many U.S. military advisers and American weapons have appeared in the Iranian border area adjacent to Iraq, in order to organize armed provocations and subversion against Iraq. The Republic of Iraq is currently the first target in the U.S. plot to defeat Arab countries one by one. These facts completely expose the "friendly" posture that U.S. officials have recently put on in front of some Arab countries. American imperialism, the most vicious enemy of the Arab people today, is not only carrying out divisive political conspiracies against Arab countries but is also making such intensive military deployments for armed threats.

    The Iranian government's announcement that it is about to sign a military agreement with the United States indicates that it has openly embarked on a path of cooperation with U.S. aggressors. This also thoroughly exposes a recent unusually despicable diplomatic trick of the Iranian government. The Iranian government once proposed to the Soviet Union in January this year to hold secret negotiations, but in the negotiations, Iran not only rejected the draft treaty of friendship, mutual non-aggression, and cooperation proposed by the Soviet Union but also refused to sign the draft treaty originally proposed by Iran itself. A Washington dispatch from United Press International on February 16th stated that U.S. authorities had long known that Iran's proposal to negotiate with the Soviet Union was nothing more than "a bargaining tactic in the U.S.-Iran defense agreement negotiations." The Soviet government has issued a statement strongly condemning the Iranian government's two-faced and insincere policy towards the Soviet Union, and announced that the Soviet government cannot ignore the Iranian government's open cooperation with foreign aggressor forces and cannot but draw corresponding conclusions from this. This is a completely necessary and solemn attitude taken by the Soviet government to ensure the security of its borders and maintain peace in the Near and Middle East. Peace-loving people of all countries resolutely support this solemn attitude of the Soviet government.

    The Iranian government had hoped that the United States would provide more "economic assistance" in the military agreement negotiations with the United States to alleviate Iran's current serious economic difficulties. However, apart from recently granting Iran new loans of more than 40 million U.S. dollars, Washington has stated after Iran agreed to sign the agreement that "the United States does not intend to provide more military or economic assistance." In fact, although Iran has received one loan after another from the United States for many years, most of these loans have been used for military purposes, and the Iranian economy has deteriorated accordingly, with people complaining everywhere. According to U.S. news agency reports, Iranian government officials, in view of the crisis in domestic rule, often "use the Iraqi events as evidence to prove that they need more help and support from the United States." However, should not the opposite lesson be drawn from the Iraqi events? The more the old Iraqi dynasty relied on foreign support and the more it violated national interests by participating in the imperialist aggression, the more serious its domestic rule crisis became, and the outcome is known to all.

    美国正把伊朗拖进民族灾难的深渊
    本报评论员
    美国政府官员2月16日宣布，美国即将同伊朗正式签订双边军事协定。同一天，伊朗外交大臣作了同样的宣布。
    美国同伊朗、土耳其和巴基斯坦这些巴格达条约残余成员国缔结双边军事协定的谈判，已经进入最后阶段。美国是要通过这种协定加强对这些国家的控制，进一步把这些国家变为美国的战争基地。根据已经透露出来的材料，这些协定规定美国军队可以进入这些国家领土，美国要在这些国家领土上建立更多的军事基地。在这方面，美国特别有兴趣于在毗邻苏联的伊朗、土耳其等国境内设立针对着苏联和其他社会主义国家的中程导弹基地。据西德“新莱因报”报道，目前已经在伊朗扎格罗斯山脉地区建设美国中程火箭装置，以形成“围绕着苏联南部的一个美国导弹圈”，在美国—伊朗军事协定签订后，就立刻要把火箭运去。西德报纸会知道这种秘密工程是并不奇怪的，因为这家报纸也谈到，西德工程师同美国人一道参加了工程建设。人们看到，杜勒斯、墨菲等美国官方人士最近在推卸美国坚持“冷战”责任的宣传运动里，还口口声声表白美国的“和平意图”，特别抵赖美国在社会主义阵营国家周围设立成百个军事基地的威胁性质。然而，事实胜于雄辩，美国不仅继续保持，而且还明目张胆地增加着这种基地！美国统治集团正是这样在坚持奉行着危害世界和平的“战争边缘”政策。
    美国在巴格达条约的残躯上缔结这些双边军事协定，其矛头也是指向阿拉伯民族独立运动的。像美国过去曾经把旧王朝统治下的伊拉克作为武装干涉叙利亚的一个中心一样，美国目前又在把伊朗变为武装干涉和颠复伊拉克共和国的一个中心。在美国唆使下，最近以来，伊朗一些亲美的议员和报纸公开在鼓吹要推翻目前的伊拉克政府。许多美国军事顾问和美式武器出现在同伊拉克接壤的伊朗边境地区，为的是组织对伊拉克的武装挑衅和颠复活动。伊拉克共和国目前正是美国在各个击破阿拉伯国家的阴谋里的第一个目标。这些事实完全揭穿了美国官方人士最近在一些阿拉伯国家面前装出的一副“友好”姿态。美帝国主义，这个阿拉伯人民当前最凶恶的敌人，不仅在对阿拉伯国家进行挑拨离间的政治阴谋活动，而且也在这样紧张地进行着武力威胁的军事部署。
    伊朗政府宣布即将同美国签订军事协定，表明它已经公开走上同美国侵略者合作的道路。这也彻底暴露了伊朗政府最近的一个异常卑劣的外交把戏。伊朗政府曾经在今年1月间向苏联倡议举行秘密谈判，然而在谈判里，伊朗不仅拒绝了苏联提出的两国友好、互不侵犯和合作条约草案，而且不愿意签署原本由伊朗自己提出的条约草案。合众国际社2月16日的一条华盛顿消息说，美国当局早已知道，伊朗倡议同苏联进行谈判不过“是在美国—伊朗防御协定谈判中进行讨价还价的一个手法”。苏联政府已经发表声明，强烈谴责伊朗政府对苏联奉行两面派的不真诚的政策，并且宣布苏联政府不能对伊朗政府公开同外国侵略势力合作的行动置若罔闻，不能不由此作出相应的结论。这是苏联政府为了保障自己国境安全和维护中近东和平而采取的完全必要的严正态度。爱好和平的各国人民都坚决支持苏联政府的这一严正态度。
    伊朗政府曾经指望在同美国的军事协定谈判里美国会给予更多的“经济援助”，来缓和伊朗当前严重的经济困难。但是，美国除了在最近通过给予伊朗四千多万美元新贷款外，华盛顿方面在伊朗答应签订协定后已表示，“美国不打算给予更多的军事或经济援助”。实际上，伊朗虽然多年来便收到美国一笔又一笔贷款，但这些贷款绝大部分都是用于军事目的，而伊朗经济也随着越来越恶化，人民怨声载道。美国通讯社的消息说，伊朗政府官员们鉴于国内统治的危机，经常向美国“以伊拉克事件作为证据，证明他们需要美国更多的帮助和支持”。然而，从伊拉克事件中难道不是正应该得出完全相反的教训吗？伊拉克旧王朝越依靠外国支持，越违背民族利益参与帝国主义的侵略勾当，它的国内统治危机也就越严重，而其结局是大家知道的。
