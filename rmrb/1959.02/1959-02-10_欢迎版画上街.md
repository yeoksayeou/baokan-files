    Welcome Woodcuts to the Streets
    Qin Li
    Passing the southern entrance of Wangfujing Street, I saw a crowd gathered in front of the gallery. Approaching, I realized the Printmaking Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts had established a new “Printmaking Bulletin Board” here.
    Many of these are original colored prints, mostly woodcuts. Most interesting is that in addition to new works by woodcut artists like Li Hua and Gu Yuan, there are also amateur creations by workers and cadres from Beijing. No wonder people were gathered there, reluctant to leave!
    Woodcuts taking to the streets is a good tradition of our woodcut movement. In the past, during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, as well as in the student democratic movements in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, woodcut workers and students used this simple weapon to serve the struggles of the time. The woodcuts in the old liberated areas had even closer ties with the masses. During the New Year and other festivals, artists also carved and printed New Year pictures and other woodcuts to meet the needs of the masses, who praised and loved them very much. Therefore, printmaking art had a deeper influence among the broad masses.
    Of course, after liberation, due to improved printing conditions, the publication of prints became more convenient, and we also had our own magazine, "Printmaking." It should be said that the relationship between prints and the masses is even closer. However, the practice of woodcuts taking to the streets was interrupted for a period. In recent years, it has been restored. For example, during the struggle against the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt and in support of the Middle Eastern people against the American and British aggression, many woodcut leaflets and woodcut propaganda posters appeared on the streets in a timely manner.
    Now that there is a fixed venue, prints can regularly meet with the masses on the streets. Painters can directly dedicate their works to the masses and let the masses evaluate them. I think this is a very good approach.

    欢迎版画上街
    秦犁
    经过王府井大街南口，看到画廊前围满了人，走近一看原来是中央美术学院版画系在这里新辟了一个“版画壁报”。
    这里面有很多是彩色的版画原作，其中以木刻居多，最有意思的是除了有木刻家李桦、古元等人的新作以外，还有北京的工人、干部的业余创作，怪不得人们围在那里不忍离去呢！
    版画上街头，这是我们木刻运动的一个好传统。过去在抗日战争和解放战争时期，以及国民党统治区的学生民主运动中，木刻工作者和学生们都曾运用过这个简便的武器为当时的斗争服务。老解放区的木刻与群众更有密切的联系，每逢过年过节时，艺术家们还刻印一些新年画之类的版画以满足群众的需要，群众都十分称赞、喜爱，因此版画艺术在广大群众中有了较深的影响。
    当然在解放之后，由于印刷条件优越了，版画的出版也方便了，也有了自己的刊物“版画”，应当说版画和群众的关系更密切了，但是版画上街头这种方式曾经中断过一个时期，近年来，又恢复了。例如在反对英法侵略埃及和支援中东人民反对美英侵略的斗争中街头上就及时出现了许多木刻传单和木刻宣传画。
    现在有了这个固定的园地，版画经常可以在街头和群众见面了，画家们尽可以把作品直接献给群众，让群众来评价。我想，这是一种很好的办法。
