    Rapid Progress in Industrial Basic Construction
    Petroleum, Chemical, Steel, and Machinery Manufacturing Industries Have Reached a Considerable Scale

    (This article) reports that Gansu Province achieved significant accomplishments in industrial basic construction in 1958. Last year, over 1,400 factories and mines at the central, provincial, prefectural, and county levels commenced production, including 39 above the quota. The province's basic industries, such as petroleum, chemical, non-ferrous metals, steel, and machinery manufacturing, have reached a considerable scale, and the railway network and power grid are also being accelerated.

    From 1870, when Gansu began building the foreign-style ordnance bureau and woolen mill, to 1949, industrial development was slow. The Lanzhou General Machinery Factory, established on the foundation of the foreign ordnance bureau, could only repair machines and assemble parts in 1949. The Northwest Woolen Mill, developed using equipment from the woolen mill, produced woolen fabrics that were called "gunny sacks" before liberation. Added to the dilapidated twenty-odd factories and mines, this was all the industrial wealth at the time. After liberation, when the province undertook large-scale construction, all steel, cement, and machinery had to be transported from other places.

    Today, Gansu's industrial landscape has greatly changed. From Tianshui, bordering Shaanxi in the east, to Jiayuguan in the west, more than ten new industrial cities, including Lanzhou, Baiyin, Huangyangzhen, Jiuquan, and Yumen, are rapidly growing across more than a thousand kilometers of land.

    The province's large-scale basic construction began with railway construction. In 1949, the state mobilized tens of thousands of railway soldiers to rush to repair the Baoji-Tianshui railway. The railway network in the province, centered on Lanzhou, has taken initial shape. The massive Lanzhou railway hub, connecting Gansu, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Ningxia, has completed part of its project and been handed over for use. Last year was a year of great leap forward in railway construction for the province, with more than 300 kilometers of railways built. Currently, the province has 2,000 kilometers of railways in operation, with several others under construction.

    Prior to last year, Gansu's industrial construction was limited to a few points such as Lanzhou and Yumen. Now, industrial construction blossoms all over the province. Large enterprises such as oil refineries, chemical plants, and thermal power plants were completed ahead of schedule last year and mostly put into production. Lanzhou, which had never refined a ton of steel in its history, has implemented the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and building from small to large, mobilizing the entire population to engage in the steel industry. It now has an annual steel production capacity of 700,000 tons and has initially formed an industrial system from mining and coking to steelmaking, steel rolling, and machinery manufacturing. On this basis, the He'kou Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise, with an annual output of 240,000 tons of various steel products, is being accelerated. The Liujiaxia Hydropower Station and the Yanguoxia Hydropower Station projects also started construction last year. In the fertile Hexi Corridor, in addition to the Yumen Oilfield, there are six or seven new industrial areas that began construction last year alone, including large-scale iron and steel joint enterprises, petroleum joint enterprises, metal product manufacturing, sugar and wine joint enterprises, and cotton textile mills. The production of Yumen Oilfield, China's first natural petroleum base, is expanding daily. In the second half of last year, the mine's employees used indigenous methods to manufacture equipment themselves and built two oil refineries with a total production capacity of 700,000 tons through self-reliance.

    Since Gansu Province adopted the method of "walking on two legs" in basic construction, last year's achievements were greater than any previous year. In terms of the amount of national investment completed alone, 1958 increased by 40% compared to 1957. With a large number of new factories and mines completed and put into production, Gansu's industrial production level has greatly improved. In terms of machinery and equipment, except for some complex ones, Gansu can now manufacture parts of the equipment for steelmaking, ironmaking, steel rolling, power generation, and chemicals locally. Building materials such as cement, firebricks, and sanitary equipment do not need to be entirely imported from coastal areas. On this basis, Gansu's industrial construction scale this year will greatly exceed last year. Light industrial production has also undergone tremendous changes, and more and more local Gansu products have appeared in stores and companies throughout the province. The woolen blankets and fabrics produced by the Northwest Woolen Mill after reconstruction have been sold far overseas. (Guo Fenxiang)

    工业基本建设突飞猛进
    石油化工钢铁机械制造等工业已具相当规模
    本报讯　甘肃省1958年工业基本建设的成就巨大。去年投入生产的中央工业以及省、专区、县的厂矿共一千四百多个，其中限额以上的三十九个。全省石油、化工、有色金属、钢铁、机械制造等基本工业已经有了相当的规模，铁路网、电力网也在加快建设中。
    从1870年甘肃开始建洋炮局、制呢厂等工业开始到1949年，工业发展迟缓。在洋炮局基础上建立的兰州通用机器厂，1949年时只能修理机器，配配零件；利用制呢厂设备发展的西北毛纺厂，解放前出产的呢料被称做“麻袋片”。加上破烂不堪的二十多个厂矿，就是当时全部工业财产。解放后，全省进行大规模建设时，所有的钢材、水泥、机器设备，全要从外地运来。
    今天，甘肃工业面貌已经大大改观。东起和陕西接壤的天水，西迄嘉峪关，在绵延一千多公里的土地上，兰州、白银、黄羊镇、酒泉、玉门等十多个新工业城市正在迅速成长。
    全省的大规模基本建设是从铁路建设开始的。1949年，国家就调动数万铁道兵抢修通宝鸡——天水铁路。全省以兰州为中心的铁路网已初具规模。规模巨大的、连接甘、新、青、宁四省区的兰州铁路枢纽部分工程已经建成移交使用。去年是全省铁路建设大跃进的一年，共修筑了三百多公里的铁路。现在，全省铁路已有二千公里通车，目前还有几条正在加紧修筑。
    去年以前，甘肃的工业建设只限于兰州、玉门等几个点上。现在，全省各地盛开着工业建设的花朵。炼油厂、化工厂、热电站等大型企业，去年都已比原计划提前建成，大部分投入生产。历史上从未炼过一吨钢的兰州市，由于贯彻了土洋并举、由小到大的建设方针，动员全民大搞钢铁工业，目前已拥有年产钢七十万吨的设备能力，并初步形成了从采矿、炼焦直到炼钢、轧钢、机械制造的工业体系。在这个基础上，年产各种钢材二十四万吨的河口钢铁联合企业正在加速建设中。刘家峡水电站和盐锅峡水电站工程也在去年开工。在富饶的河西走廊除玉门油矿以外，仅去年开始建设的新工业区就有六七个，其中包括大型钢铁联合企业、石油联合企业、金属品制造业、糖酒联合企业、棉纺织厂等。我国第一个天然石油基地玉门油矿的生产在日益扩大。去年下半年，全矿职工用土办法自制设备，自力更生建设起总生产能力为七十万吨的两个炼油厂。
    甘肃省基本建设采用两条腿走路的办法以后，去年的建设成就比以往任何一年为大，光从完成的国家投资数量来看，1958年比1957年增加了40％。新厂矿大量建成投入生产后，甘肃的工业生产水平已大大提高。在机器设备方面，除一些复杂的外，像炼钢、炼铁、轧钢、发电、化工部分设备，甘肃已能就地制造，水泥、耐火砖、暖卫设备等建筑器材，也不必全部从沿海地区调进。在这个基础上，甘肃今年的工业建设规模将大大超过去年。轻工业生产也有了巨大变化，省内各地商店、公司中已出现愈来愈多的甘肃本地产品。西北毛纺厂经过改建，生产的毛毯、呢料已远销国外。　（郭汾祥）
