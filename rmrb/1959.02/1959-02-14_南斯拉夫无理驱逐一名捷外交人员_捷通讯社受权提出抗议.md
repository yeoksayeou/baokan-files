Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 13th: The Czechoslovak News Agency was recently authorized to issue a statement strongly protesting the Yugoslav authorities' unjustified expulsion of a diplomatic staff member from the Czechoslovak Embassy in Belgrade.
    The statement points out that this is another action aimed at undermining the mutual relations between Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. The "reason" put forward by the Yugoslav authorities for this action is that a Yugoslav diplomatic staff member stationed in Czechoslovakia, Busevic, was recently expelled from Czechoslovakia. Busevic was expelled because he had an improper relationship with a minor Czechoslovak female student, which ultimately led to the female student's suicide. The statement said that Busevic's behavior violated the law and was extremely incompatible with the conduct of a diplomatic personnel.
    The statement said that the Yugoslav authorities used the Czechoslovak government's expulsion of Busevic as an excuse to unjustifiably expel Czechoslovak diplomatic personnel, while they had never expressed the slightest dissatisfaction with the activities of this Czechoslovak diplomatic personnel. This action shows that the Yugoslav authorities are not interested in the normal development of mutual relations and have no intention of resolving various possible problems based on established facts and in accordance with the principles of mutual respect and understanding.

    南斯拉夫无理驱逐一名捷外交人员
    捷通讯社受权提出抗议
    新华社布拉格13日电　捷克斯洛伐克通讯社最近受权发表声明，强硬抗议南斯拉夫当局无理驱逐一名捷克斯洛伐克驻贝尔格莱德大使馆的外交人员。
    声明指出，这是又一次目的在于破坏捷南两国相互关系的行动。南斯拉夫当局对它的这种行动所提出的“理由”是，南斯拉夫一个驻捷外交人员布塞维奇最近被捷克斯洛伐克驱逐出境。而布塞维奇之被驱逐是因为他同一个未成年的捷克斯洛伐克女学生发生了不正当的男女关系，并最后导致了这个女学生的自杀。声明说，布塞维奇的这种行为是违背法律的，并且同一个外交人员的行为极不相容。
    声明说，南斯拉夫当局把捷克斯洛伐克政府驱逐布塞维奇出境作为无理驱逐捷克斯洛伐克外交人员的借口，而它对这位捷克斯洛伐克外交人员的活动却从未表示过丝毫的不满。这种行动表明：南斯拉夫当局对相互关系的正常发展不感兴趣，并且无意根据确定的事实和按照相互尊重和谅解的原则来解决各种可能发生的问题。
