Xinhua News Agency, Guantanamo, 4th. Cuban Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Castro, at a mass rally of 15,000 people on the 3rd, condemned the U.S. Ambassador for interfering in Cuban internal affairs and called on the Cuban people to strive for economic independence and freedom.

Castro made these remarks in a park in Guantanamo, Oriente Province, eastern Cuba, about 27 miles from the U.S. naval base. Guantanamo Bay has been occupied by the United States as a "naval base" for more than 50 years. The United States used this base to provide the Batista dictatorship with arms and weapons to suppress the Cuban uprising.

According to reports, Castro, speaking to the cheering crowd at the mass rally, said, "We must be economically liberated." He emphasized that "Cuba has not been well managed for fifty years because no one has taken such responsibility, nor has anyone played such a role that they can issue orders." Castro then said, "The person issuing orders is the U.S. Ambassador." He condemned the U.S. Ambassador for being in charge of Cuban affairs. Castro mentioned that some people think it is a good thing that seven U.S. ships are stationed in Guantanamo Bay. But he said, "In reality, this shows that Cuba is a weak country."

Speaking about the upcoming land reform plan, Castro said that the land reform law still has shortcomings, "Our goal is to immediately demand the passage of a more extensive land law." Castro condemned the "land robbers" for stealing approximately 7.5 million acres of land in Cuba. But he assured that "constitutional measures" would be taken in the future to recover these lands. Castro arrived in Oriente Province from Havana on the 1st. He personally led a 200-person land reform "shock brigade" to implement land reform in the old base of the rebel army in the Sierra Maestra mountains.

    卡斯特罗号召人民争取经济独立
    谴责美国大使干涉古巴内政
    新华社4日讯　关塔那摩消息：古巴武装部队总司令卡斯特罗3日在一个一万五千人的群众大会上谴责美国大使干涉古巴内政，并且号召古巴人民争取经济上的独立和自由。
    卡斯特罗是在古巴东部奥连特省的关塔那摩、离美国海军基地约二十七英里的一个公园里讲这番话的。到目前为止，关塔那摩海湾已经被美国占领作为“海军基地”有五十多年。美国曾利用这个基地给巴蒂斯塔独裁政权提供军火和武器，用来镇压古巴的起义运动。
    据报道，卡斯特罗在向群众大会上热烈欢呼的人发表演说时说，“我们必须在经济上得到解放”。他强调说，“五十年来，古巴一直没有得到好好的管理，因为没有人负起过这样的责任，也没有人发挥过这样的作用，以致可以发布命令”。卡斯特罗接着说，“发布命令的人是美国大使”。他谴责美国大使一直掌管着古巴的事务。卡斯特罗讲到有些人认为有七艘美国舰只停留在关塔那摩海湾是件好事情。但是他说，“实际上这表明古巴是一个弱国”。
    卡斯特罗在谈到即将进行的土地改革计划时说，土地改革的法律还有不足之处，“我们的目标是立即要求通过一项更为广泛的土地法律”。卡斯特罗谴责说，“土地强盗”抢走了古巴大约七百五十万英亩的土地。但是他保证将来采取“宪法措施”来收回这些土地。卡斯特罗是在1日从哈瓦那到奥连特省来的。他亲自率领了一支二百人的土地改革“突击队”，以便在马埃斯特腊山区起义军的老根据地去实施土地改革。
