Xinhua News Agency, 7th. To convey the greetings of people from all walks of life across the country to their own soldiers, Spring Festival慰问 delegations from various provinces and cities have recently launched extensive慰问 activities throughout the country.
    In the capital, the delegation led by Wu Han, the Deputy Mayor of Beijing, began on the 2nd to慰问 officers and soldiers stationed in Beijing, the sick and wounded, convalescents, and disabled veterans in eight different directions. Wherever they went, they held慰问 rallies, reporting to the officers and soldiers on the great achievements of socialist construction in the capital and the country last year, and the major tasks of socialist construction this year. They encouraged all officers and soldiers to continue to carry forward the glorious traditions of the People's Army, improve their military and political levels, and make greater contributions to the cause of socialist construction. The accompanying eight art troupes, including the China Peking Opera Theater and the China Pingju Opera Theater, performed extensively for the officers and soldiers.
    The Hebei Provincial People's慰问 Delegation, led by Deputy Governor Gao Shuxun, began carrying a large number of慰问 gifts from January 26th and set off in different directions to慰问. A慰问 rally was also held in Tianjin.
    Members of the Liaoning Provincial 慰问 Delegation braved wind and snow these days, climbing mountains and wading through rivers to慰问 troops in various remote areas. The fourth sub-delegation met with officers and soldiers in every work area when慰问 a construction unit. They held hands with the soldiers and asked each other about the cold and warmth affectionately. The female comrades of the慰问 delegation sewed and mended military uniforms for the soldiers.
    The twelve sub-delegations of the Guangdong Provincial People's Spring Festival 慰问 Delegation, led by Governor Chen Yu, have all set off separately. Entrusted by the people of the province, they carried a large number of慰问 letters and books. Guangzhou and Shantou alone had more than 220,000慰问 letters and 130,000 books. Accompanying them were Peking Opera, Cantonese Opera, acrobatics, and Qiong Opera troupes.
    The Yunnan Provincial慰问 Delegation, which慰问 the railway soldiers on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, has recently held many慰问 rallies. Zhou Chiping, Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, warmly praised the heroic achievements of the railway soldiers in overcoming countless difficulties and building roads tenaciously at one rally. The sub-delegations of Zhaotong, Qujing, and Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture have all gone deep into various construction sites and carried out recreational activities with the road-building soldiers and laborers.
    In Shanghai, the慰问 delegation led by Xu Jianguo, the head of the delegation and Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, Lieutenant General Liu Fei, the Deputy Commander of the Shanghai Garrison, and Vice Admiral Rao Shoukun, the Deputy Commander of the East China Sea Fleet, has gone to various hospitals of the People's Liberation Army to慰问 the sick and wounded. The actors accompanying the慰问 delegation have also made wonderful performances.
    On the evening of the 7th, Jinan City held a grand慰问 rally to慰问 the officers and soldiers stationed there. Tan Qilong, the head of the Shandong Provincial People's Spring Festival 慰问 Delegation and Governor of the Province, warmly慰问 the troops stationed throughout the province on behalf of the 54 million people at the meeting. This 慰问 delegation will soon set off separately to慰问 troops stationed in various parts of Shandong and revolutionary disabled veterans.
    On the Fujian Front, the footsteps of the members of the Fujian Provincial People's Spring Festival 慰问 Delegation have traversed the forward positions, coastal islands, and many inland military camps. The Northeast Three Provinces Fujian Front 慰问 Performance Troupe also rushed to the Xiamen front on the 7th to celebrate the festival together with the heroic three services in the trenches.
