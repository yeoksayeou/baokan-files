To vigorously increase the production of coke and improve the quality of coke is an extremely important aspect of ensuring a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in steel production this year. We will produce 18 million tons of steel this year. The quantity of steel is premised on the quantity of iron; steel can become materials on the premise that the steel is good steel, and good steel is also premised on the iron being good iron. And the quantity and quality of iron are closely related to the quantity and quality of coke. Not only is coke needed for ironmaking, but the quality of coke has a great impact on the yield and quality of iron. For every 1% increase in the ash content of coke, the productivity of the blast furnace decreases by 2% to 2.5%, and for every 1% increase in the sulfur content of coke, the productivity of the blast furnace also decreases by 2% to 2.5%. This is the impact of coke quality on pig iron production. The ash and sulfur content in coke are often the main sources of ash and sulfur in pig iron. This is the impact of coke quality on pig iron quality. In order to fulfill the great plan of producing 18 million tons of steel, and to achieve "iron is good iron, steel is good steel, steel becomes materials, and materials are of various kinds," coke production must not only have a large increase in quantity but also a large improvement in quality. This is an extremely important task at present.

Industrial production is interlocked. To make coke production not only have a large increase in quantity but also a large improvement in quality, the most important thing is to improve the quality of coal used for coking. The most important step in improving the quality of coking coal is: all raw coal supplied for metallurgical coke production, except for those with particularly low ash and sulfur content, must be washed and selected. To achieve this requirement, it is necessary to rapidly increase coal washing capacity. In this regard, in addition to accelerating the construction of large-scale coal washing plants and tapping the potential of existing coal washing plants, the most suitable method for the current needs is to vigorously develop simple coal washing plants, because simple coal washing plants can be built quickly, require less investment, require less steel, and the problems of equipment and materials are easy to solve, which can achieve immediate results. For example, a simple coal washing plant with an annual capacity of 300,000 tons of raw coal can be built in a few months, with an investment of only one yuan per ton of coal washing capacity and only two tons of steel. As long as we conscientiously implement the policy of combining large-scale enterprises with small and medium-sized enterprises, and combining indigenous methods with foreign methods, it will not be difficult to rapidly increase coal washing capacity and ensure the quality of coal used for coking.

Solving the quality problem of coal used for coking does not mean solving the production quantity and quality problems of coking itself. To produce more and better coke, on the one hand, we must do everything possible to tap the potential of existing large-scale modern coking plants and actively build new large-scale modern coking plants; on the other hand, we must actively improve indigenous coking technology and vigorously promote simple coking furnaces. Large-scale modern coking furnaces have high output, good quality, and consume less labor, and are the backbone of coke production. This is beyond doubt. However, the number of large-scale modern coking plants in our country is still not large, and their strength alone cannot meet the needs of the high-speed development of steel production. The construction of new plants also takes time, and even if construction starts immediately, they will not be put into production until after the third quarter. Therefore, while we are grasping the production and construction of large-scale modern coking plants, we must also grasp the vigorous promotion of simple coking furnaces.

Indigenous coking methods showed their prowess in the mass steelmaking campaign last year. Last year, the output of coke from indigenous kilns accounted for a large proportion of the total coke output. In this year's coke production tasks, coke from indigenous kilns will still account for a large proportion. The indigenous coke ovens producing this kind of coke have the advantages of saving investment, fast construction, simple equipment, and easy operation; moreover, as long as they are technically improved, their coke yield and labor productivity can be improved, and the ash and sulfur content of coke can also be reduced. Recently, some places have created some simple coking furnaces combining indigenous and foreign methods. The furnace type of this kind of simple coking furnace is basically the same as that of mechanized large-scale coking furnaces, but it does not use or uses less mechanical equipment, so it requires less investment, can be built quickly, and is easy to be implemented everywhere. This kind of coking furnace not only has a high coke yield and good coke quality, but also can recover by-products such as benzene, ammonia, high-temperature coal tar, and gas. It should be the direction of development of small and medium-sized coking industries. While vigorously improving indigenous coking methods, all localities must vigorously promote simple coking furnaces.

In addition to accelerating the construction of large-scale coal washing plants and coking plants, and tapping the potential of existing modern coal washing plants and coking plants, vigorously developing simple coal washing plants, vigorously developing simple coking furnaces, and vigorously improving indigenous coking methods is a correct path to increase coke production and improve coke quality. Galloping straight ahead along this road can ensure that the blast furnaces are well-fed and well-nourished. However, to keep running on this road, we must still muster our energy and strive for the upper reaches. The direction is set, the methods are available, but if the energy is insufficient, we will still not be able to move fast. All the representatives attending the National Coal Washing, Coking, and Oil Recovery On-Site Conference have issued a proposal to the comrades engaged in coal washing, coking, and petrochemical work across the country, proposing to guarantee that the blast furnaces are well-fed and well-nourished. This is a loud bugle call. Comrades across the country engaged in this work must bring out their soaring energy and devote themselves to the struggle to increase coke production and improve coke quality.

Quality and quantity are unified. Without quantity, there is no quality to speak of; if quality is not guaranteed, the value of quantity is reduced. This is especially true in the case of coke. For every 1% increase in the ash content of coke, the coke consumption of ironmaking increases by 1.5% to 2.5%, and for every 1% increase in the sulfur content of coke, the coke consumption of ironmaking also increases by 1.5% to 2.5%. If we put quantity and quality in opposition, and only care about quantity but not quality, we will inevitably increase the quantity task even more. Only by unifying quantity and quality, grasping both quantity and quality, so that the coke consumption of ironmaking can be continuously reduced, can we be more confident in guaranteeing the supply in terms of quantity. While increasing coke production and improving coke quality, we must also widely recover coal tar in indigenous coking and gradually realize the recovery and utilization of ammonia water and gas. Comprehensive utilization of coal in the coking process is an important aspect of comprehensive utilization of coal and is also a relatively easy method to achieve at present. Some people suspect that recovering by-products may be detrimental to coke output. Theory and practice have proved that extracting coal tar and other by-products in the coking process does not contradict coke output. Oil extraction does not affect coke output, and in some places, in order to extract oil, the kiln type and operation of indigenous coke ovens have been improved, which has also increased the coke yield and eliminated the phenomenon of raw coke. Although some comrades agree with the recovery and utilization of coal tar, they believe that the technology is complex and requires modern equipment, and indigenous coking cannot carry out comprehensive utilization. Even if it is utilized, the amount of by-products recovered is not large. In fact, indigenous coking has already received oil, and some places have received it very well and a lot. Although some places did not receive much at the beginning, it is entirely possible to gradually increase it. From nothing to something, from less to more, from one kind to many kinds, from low-level to high-level, continuous development, and continuous improvement are the only way to comprehensively utilize resources. It is wrong not to pay attention to comprehensive utilization, and it is also unrealistic to try to utilize it perfectly all at once.

We believe that the vast masses on the coal washing and coking front will continue to muster their energy on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward to achieve a greater leap forward, and will surely send more and better coke to the sides of large and small blast furnaces, so that the production plan of 18 million tons of steel will be successfully realized!

    大搞简易洗煤厂  大搞简易炼焦炉
    大力增产焦炭、提高焦炭质量，是保证今年钢铁生产更大更好更全面跃进的一个极为重要方面。我们今年要生产一千八百万吨钢。钢的数量以铁的数量为前提；钢要成材以钢是好钢为前提，钢是好钢也以铁是好铁为前提。而铁的数量和质量同焦炭的数量和质量又有着密切的关系。不但炼铁要用焦炭，而且焦炭的质量对铁的产量和质量都有很大的影响。焦炭的灰分每增加1％，高炉的生产率就要降低2％到2.5％，焦炭的硫分每增加1％，高炉的生产率也要降低2％到2.5％。这是焦炭质量对生铁产量的影响。焦炭中的灰分和硫分经常是生铁中的灰分和硫分的主要来源，这是焦炭质量对生铁质量的影响。为了完成生产一千八百万吨钢的伟大计划，做到“铁是好铁、钢是好钢、钢要成材、材要多种”，炼焦生产不仅在数量上要有很大的增长，而且在质量上也要有很大的提高。这是当前一项极其重要的任务。
    工业生产是一环套一环的，要使炼焦生产不仅在数量上有很大的增长，而且在质量上有很大的提高，首先要提高炼焦用煤的质量。提高炼焦煤的质量，最主要的一关是：凡供炼冶金焦用的原煤，除灰分、硫分特别低的以外，都必须经过洗选。要达到这个要求，就要迅速提高洗煤能力。在这方面，除了加速大型洗煤厂的建设，并挖掘现有洗煤厂潜力以外，最能适应当前需要的办法是大搞简易洗煤厂，因为简易洗煤厂建设快，投资少，需要的钢材少，设备和材料问题都容易解决，能收立竿见影之效。例如，建设一个每年洗原煤三十万吨的简易洗煤厂，几个月就可以建成，每吨洗煤能力只需投资一元，只需钢材两吨。只要我们认真贯彻大型企业和中小型企业并举、土法生产和洋法生产并举的方针，就不难迅速提高洗煤能力，保证炼焦用煤的质量。
    解决了炼焦用煤的质量问题，并不等于解决了炼焦生产本身的产量和质量问题。要生产更多更好的焦炭。一方面要千方百计挖掘现有的大型现代化炼焦厂的潜力，并且积极建设新的大型现代化炼焦厂；另一方面还要积极提高土法炼焦技术，大力推广简易炼焦炉。大型现代化炼焦炉产量高、质量好、耗用的劳动力少，是炼焦生产中的骨干力量，这是毫无疑问的。但是，我国现有的大型现代化炼焦厂为数还不多，光靠他们的力量，目前还无法满足钢铁生产高速度发展的需要。建设新厂也需要一个时间，即便是现在马上着手建设，也要到第三季度之后才能投入生产。因此，我们在抓紧大型现代化炼焦厂的生产和建设的同时，一定还要抓紧大力推广简易炼焦炉。
    土法炼焦在去年全民办钢铁的运动中曾经大显身手，去年土窑焦的产量在焦炭总产量中占很大的一部分，今年的焦炭生产任务中，土窑焦仍将占很大的比重。生产这种土窑焦的土焦炉具有投资省、建设快、设备简单、操作简易等优点；而且，只要经过技术上的改进和提高，它的成焦率、劳动生产率都可以提高，焦炭的灰分和硫分也都可以降低。最近有些地方创造了一些土洋结合的简易炼焦炉，这种简易炼焦炉的炉型基本上同机械化的大型炼焦炉相同，却不用或少用机械设备，因而投资少、建设快，便于遍地开花。这种炼焦炉不仅成焦率高，焦炭质量好，而且能回收苯、氨、高温焦油和煤气等副产品，应该作为中小型炼焦工业的发展方向。各地在大力提高土法炼焦的同时，必须大力推广简易炼焦炉。
    除了加速大型洗煤厂和炼焦厂的建设，并挖掘现有现代化洗煤厂和炼焦厂的潜力以外，大搞简易洗煤厂，大搞简易炼焦炉，大力提高土法炼焦，这是增加焦炭产量、提高焦炭质量的一条正确道路。沿着这条道路纵马直前，就可以做到让高炉吃饱、吃好。但是，要想在这条道路上马不停蹄，还必须鼓足干劲，力争上游。方针定了，办法有了，干劲不足，还是走不快的。出席全国洗煤、炼焦、收油现场会议的全体代表，已经向全国从事洗煤、炼焦、石油化工工作的同志们发出了倡议书，提出保证让高炉吃饱，吃好。这是一声响亮的号角，全国从事这方面工作的同志们，都要拿出冲天的干劲来，投身到增产焦炭，提高焦炭质量的斗争中去。
    质量和数量是统一的。没有数量，便谈不到质量；不保证质量，数量的价值就降低了。在焦炭的问题上尤其是如此。焦炭的灰分每增加1％，炼铁的焦炭消耗量就增加1.5％至2.5％，焦炭的硫分每增加1％，炼铁的焦炭消耗量也增加1.5％至2.5％。如果我们把数量和质量对立起来，只顾数量不顾质量，势必要更加重数量任务。只有把数量和质量统一起来，既抓数量又抓质量，使得炼铁的焦炭消耗量能够不断降低，数量上保证供应才更加有把握。在增加焦炭产量，提高焦炭质量的同时，还必须做到在土法炼焦中广泛回收焦油，逐步实现对氨水和煤气的回收和利用。在炼焦过程中综合利用煤炭，是煤炭综合利用的一个重要方面，也是目前比较容易实现的方法。有人怀疑回收副产品可能对出焦不利。理论和实践都证明，在炼焦过程中提取焦油和其他副产品，同出焦并无矛盾。抽油并不影响出焦，而且有些地方为了抽油，改进了土焦炉的窑型和操作，还提高了成焦率，消灭了生焦现象。有些同志虽然赞成焦油回收利用，但却认为技术复杂，需要现代化设备，土法炼焦不能进行综合利用，即使利用了，回收副产品的数量也不大。事实上，土法炼焦已经收到了油，而且有些地方收得很好很多。虽然也有的地方开始时收得不多，但完全有可能逐步提高。从无到有，从少到多，从一种到多种，从低级到高级，不断发展，不断完善，是资源综合利用的必由之路。不重视综合利用是不对的，企图一下子尽善尽美地利用也是不现实的。
    我们相信，经过洗煤、炼焦战线上的广大群众在去年大跃进的基础上继续鼓足干劲，实现更大的跃进，一定能把更多更好的焦炭送到大大小小的高炉旁边，使一千八百万吨钢的生产计划胜利实现！
