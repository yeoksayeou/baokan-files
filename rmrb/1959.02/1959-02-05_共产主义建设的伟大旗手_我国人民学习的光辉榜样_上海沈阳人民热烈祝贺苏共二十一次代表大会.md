Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 4th: The news of the 21st Congress of the CPSU has become the most important thing in the lives of the people of Shanghai in recent days. People are repeatedly reading Comrade Khrushchev's report on the control figures for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union from 1959 to 1965. The many brilliant figures in the report have brought great encouragement and endless strength to the people of Shanghai.

Shi Ximin, Vice President of the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said: The convocation of the 21st Congress of the CPSU is a great encouragement to the working people of the world. After the completion of the seven-year plan, it will prepare huge material and spiritual conditions for the Soviet Union to transition to communism. We believe that the Soviet people will be able to complete the seven-year plan ahead of schedule and with overachievement.

Wang Shusen, an old worker of the No. 2 State Cotton Factory who participated in the "May 30th" revolutionary struggle and a representative of the National People's Congress, said excitedly: The 21st Congress of the CPSU has illuminated the whole world, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the lighthouse of progressive humanity in the world.

Teachers and students of Fudan University, East China Normal University, Jiaotong University and other schools took Comrade Khrushchev's report and the speeches of many other comrades at the 21st Congress of the CPSU as learning materials for celebrating the winter vacation. Many teachers and students carefully read and discussed the part of the seven-year plan concerning the peaceful education of the Soviet Union. Everyone felt that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union attached great importance to the communist education of young people, and that they should improve themselves well in the future and learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with an open mind. Professor Su Buqing, Vice President of Fudan University, said that the success of the launch of the space rocket and the large-scale research on thermonuclear reactions will both facilitate the development of the Soviet Union's communist construction, and also powerfully prove that the Soviet Union is the best example in developing science and technology. He expressed that he would further go all out, do a good job in teaching and scientific research, and contribute to accelerating our country's socialist construction and competing peacefully with imperialism together with the Soviet people.

Zhou Zhihong, Dean of the Metallurgical College of Jiaotong University, Feng Depai, Director of the Institute of Physiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Deputy Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Wang Yinglai, Director of the Institute of Biochemistry, all said: While Soviet scientists are committed to developing cutting-edge modern science and technology, they are constantly strengthening the connection between scientific research work and production practice, and rapidly and widely applying the latest achievements in science and technology to the national economy. This is an example worth learning from. We must better learn from the advanced scientific and technological work experience of the Soviet Union.

In recent days, the vast number of cadres have been earnestly reading and studying Khrushchev's report. Cadres in many units have organized informal discussions. Neighborhoods in urban areas have also used reading sessions, discussion meetings or blackboards to publicize the Soviet Union's seven-year plan for building communism to the general public. Many housewives said excitedly at the discussion meeting: "As long as we learn from the Soviet Union better, our lives will definitely be better."

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th: In recent days, the broad masses of the people in Shenyang have warmly hailed the convocation of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The magnificent plan mentioned in Comrade Khrushchev's report on the control figures for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union from 1959 to 1965 has greatly inspired the people of the city.

These days, the Soviet seven-year plan has become the center of discussion for workers and staff of factories and enterprises in Shenyang. Tang Jiyao, a worker at the Shenyang First Machine Tool Plant, said: "The Soviet seven-year plan will lay a solid foundation for the transition to communism, and it is also a very encouraging prospect." Many workers and engineering technicians have stated that they must further learn from the Soviet Union this year, go all out with greater efforts, and ensure the better completion of tasks as a gift to the 21st Congress of the CPSU.

The members of the people's communes in the suburbs of Shenyang were deeply moved by the Soviet Union's magnificent plan for building communism. Bu Quanzhong, the station chief of the Shahezi Work Station of the Beiling People's Commune, said excitedly: "After seven years, the level of agricultural production in the Soviet Union will develop to the point where it can fully meet the needs of residents for food and industrial raw materials, and ensure all other needs of the country for agricultural products. This is really a great thing!" The cadres and members of this work station all stated that they would take practical actions to accumulate more fertilizer and accumulate good fertilizer to celebrate the convocation of the 21st Congress of the CPSU.

People from all walks of life in Shenyang, including literary and art workers, scientists, educators, and citizens, have also expressed their feelings. Writer Shao Hua said: "Comrade Khrushchev's report at the 21st Congress of the CPSU is like a newly rising man-made sun, illuminating the hearts of hundreds of millions of people all over the world." Guo Kexin, a researcher at the Institute of Metal Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Tan Bingyu, an associate researcher, both said that it can be seen from the scientific plan proposed in the Soviet seven-year plan that Soviet science is developing at a high speed, which capitalist countries cannot match. Associate researcher Zhuang Yuzhi, and Xu Weijun and Wang Daxiong, engineers of the Shenyang Branch of the Beijing Chemical Research Institute, all stated that in the future, they must dare to think and act like Soviet scientists so that our country's scientific undertakings can better serve construction.

Teachers of the Mining Department of Northeast Institute of Technology said: We want to sing for the Soviet Union's magnificent seven-year plan. The figures and indicators of this plan are so kind to us. It encourages the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world to strive for a happy tomorrow.
