Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: According to Xinhua News Agency, the flames of anger against colonial rule are burning in the British-owned Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in Central Africa. In recent days, people in various parts of Nyasaland have held large-scale demonstrations to protest the British colonial authorities' sentencing of three prominent activists of the Nyasaland African National Congress and many other local African leaders.

    In Karonga, at the northern end of Lake Nyasa, crowds demonstrated in front of the local prison. Colonial police attacked the demonstrators with smoke bombs and tear gas. The angry demonstrators fought them back and released a prisoner from the prison.
    In Ncheu, in southern Nyasaland, local people demonstrated on the morning of the 20th to protest the colonial authorities' sentencing of eighteen Africans to six months in prison each on the "crime" of "holding illegal assemblies and engaging in illegal activities." Local police attacked the protesting crowds in Ncheu with tear gas. When the crowds refused to disperse, the police beat them with batons. The colonial authorities announced that one injured African was arrested.
    It is reported that earlier, when crowds demonstrated in Poma, in central Nyasaland, the colonial police also took similar violent actions.
    The British colonial authorities have dispatched two battalions of British troops by air to Karonga on the 20th to reinforce the troops suppressing the local people. Colonial police forces have also been rushed there from Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia.
    The British "Daily Telegraph" reported that in the past few weeks, there have been marches and demonstrations, and clashes with the police almost every day. These struggles are part of the African people's struggle to demand that Africans immediately administer Nyasaland and to break away from the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which was established against the will of the people of Nyasaland.
    In an editorial, "The Times" linked these reports with recent news of instability and demonstrations in the Belgian Congo and French Congo, thus reflecting the fear of colonial countries in the face of the growing national liberation movement. The newspaper said: "There is now a danger of a full-scale fire breaking out." The newspaper called on the relevant metropolitan countries—Britain, Belgium, and France—to "restore order" in their territories.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: Blantyre news: Hastings Banda, President of the Nyasaland African National Congress, said on the 21st that in Nyasaland, Africans are in the vast majority, and he firmly demands that the majority Africans administer their own country.
    He pointed out that his party demands that Africans should be in the majority in the Legislative Council and the Executive Council.
    Referring to the British colonial authorities' increasing deployment of troops and police for suppression, Banda said: "What is the use of this? Your (British) troops and police can never solve a political problem, and the current problem is precisely a political problem."
    It is reported that representatives of the Nyasaland African National Congress, when passing through London after attending the All-African People's Conference in Accra, submitted a memorandum to the British government demanding immediate independence for Nyasaland.
    On the 21st, the British authorities continued to transfer troops from Northern Rhodesia to Nyasaland. Sir Roy Welensky (a Briton), Prime Minister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, clamored on the 21st to take "the most vigorous measures." He threatened: "We have ample armed forces, and we will not hesitate to use them."
    In a statement on the anti-colonial riots that occurred on the 20th, the Nyasaland colonial authorities admitted that the police had fired on the crowds.

    尼亚萨兰爆发反殖民统治示威
    英国殖民当局增调武装力量加紧镇压活动
    “泰晤士报”惊呼将有全面发生大火的危险
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：反对殖民统治的怒火正在中非英属罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦燃烧着。尼亚萨兰各地人民在近几天来举行了大规模的示威游行，抗议英国殖民当局对尼亚萨兰的三位非洲人国民大会的著名活动家和许多其他当地的非洲领袖的判刑。
    在尼亚萨湖北端的卡龙加，群众在当地监狱前面举行了示威。殖民警察用烟幕弹和催泪瓦斯袭击示威群众，愤怒的示威群众击退了他们，把一个犯人从监狱中释放出来。
    在尼亚萨兰南部的恩切乌，当地人民在20日上午举行示威，抗议殖民当局以“举行非法集会和进行非法活动”的“罪名”，判处十八名非洲人各以六个月的徒刑。当地警察用催泪瓦斯袭击恩切乌的抗议群众，群众拒绝走散，警察就用棍子殴打他们。殖民当局宣布，一个受伤的非洲人被捕。
    据报道，早些时候，在尼亚萨兰中部的波马的群众举行示威时，殖民警察也采取了类似的暴力行动。
    英国殖民当局已经调派两营英国军队在20日乘飞机赶往卡龙加，增援镇压当地人民的军队。殖民警察部队也从尼亚萨兰和北罗得西亚赶往那里。
    英国“每日电讯报”报道，在过去几星期内，几乎每天都有游行示威，同警察发生冲突的事件。这些斗争成为非洲人民为了要求立即让非洲人管理尼亚萨兰和要求脱离不顾尼亚萨兰人民的意志而建立的罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦而进行的斗争的一部分。
    “泰晤士报”在一篇社论中把这些报道同最近有关比属刚果和法属刚果不稳定和举行示威游行的消息联系起来，从而反映殖民主义国家在日益增长的民族解放运动面前的恐惧状况。报纸说：“现在酿有全面发生大火的危险”。这家报纸要求有关宗主国——英国、比利时和法国——在他们领地“恢复秩序”。
    新华社22日讯　布兰太尔消息：尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会主席班达21日说，在尼亚萨兰，非洲人占绝大多数，他坚决要求由占多数的非洲人来管理自己的国家。
    他指出，他的政党要求在立法会议和行政会议中非洲人应该占多数。
    班达谈到英国殖民当局增调军队和警察进行镇压时说：“这有什么用呢？你们（英国）的军队和警察从来不能解决一个政治问题，而目前的问题正是政治问题。”
    据报道，尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会的代表在参加了阿克拉全非人民大会后路过伦敦时，曾经向英国政府提出一份备忘录要求尼亚萨兰立刻独立。
    英国当局21日继续从北罗得西亚调遣军队到尼亚萨兰。罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦总理韦伦斯基（英国人）21日叫嚣要采取“最有力的手段”。他恫吓说：“我们拥有充分的武装力量，我们将毫不踌躇地使用它们”。
    尼亚萨兰殖民当局在就20日发生的反抗殖民统治的骚乱发表的声明中承认，警察曾向群众开枪。
