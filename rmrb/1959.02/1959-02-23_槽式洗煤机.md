Industrial Common Sense

    A trough coal washer separates clean coal and waste rock by placing the coal in a trough and flushing it with water. The clean coal is light and easily moved by the water, and is quickly carried away; while the waste rock is heavy and not easily moved by the water, and sinks to the bottom of the trough, moving slowly.
    If we change the slope of the trough, that is, change the speed and force of the water flow, we can control which specific gravity of coal is washed away, and which specific gravity of particles move slowly at the bottom of the trough and are discharged from the slag discharge box. The trough coal washer is made up of various troughs of different slopes and lengths, and according to the different slopes and water flushing forces, the raw coal is divided into various products with different ash content. Trough coal washers can be made of wood or iron, and the effect is the same.
    Trough coal washers are divided into three types: ground chutes, fine coal trough coal washers, and lump coal trough coal washers.
    The ground chute is a trough built of bricks or wooden boards on the ground according to the slope of the terrain. In the past, ground chutes did not have slag discharge boxes installed, but instead used manual labor to dig out the waste rock and middlings that had sunk to the bottom; now some have been improved and can also be automatically discharged with slag discharge boxes. Ground chutes can wash raw coal of 50 mm or less, or 13 mm or less. To wash larger-sized coal, the trough can be shorter; to wash smaller-sized coal, the trough should be longer. The quality of the coal washed out by ground chutes is relatively poor.
    The fine coal trough coal washer is used to wash fine coal of 15 or 13 mm or less. This type of trough is relatively long, generally 15 to 20 meters, with three to four troughs arranged vertically. There are a dozen or so slag discharge boxes on the trough to discharge heavy objects. The heavy objects discharged from the upper trough go to the lower trough for washing, because the coal particles are fine and difficult to separate from the small waste rock particles. The lump coal trough coal washer is used to process lump coal of 60 to 13 mm. However, raw coal with good coal quality below 50 mm can also be used for washing. Lump coal trough coal washers are generally 8 to 9 meters long and have two slag discharge boxes; there are also those that are lengthened to 12 to 13 meters and have three slag discharge boxes.

    槽式洗煤机
    把煤放到一个槽中，用水冲它，精煤轻容易被水冲动，并且很快地被水带走；而矸石重不易被水冲动，沉在槽底作缓慢的移动，这样就使精煤和矸石分开。
    假使我们变更槽子的坡度，也就是变更水流的速度和冲力，就可以控制使那种比重的煤冲走，而使那种比重的颗粒在槽底缓慢移动，由排渣箱排出。槽式洗煤机就是由各种不同坡度和不同长度的槽子连接成的，根据坡度不同，水冲力不同，把原煤分成各种不同灰分的产品。槽式洗煤机可用木制或铁制，效果一样。
    槽式洗煤机分地溜槽、末煤槽式洗煤机和块煤槽式洗煤机三种。
    地溜槽是根据地形的坡度在地面用砖砌的或用木板制的槽子。过去地溜槽不安装排渣箱，而是用人工把沉在底上的矸石和中煤挖出去；现在有的已经做了改进，也可以用排渣箱自动排放。地溜槽可以洗五十公厘以下的或十三公厘以下的原煤，洗粒度大的煤，槽子可以短一些；洗粒度小的煤，槽子要长一些。地溜槽洗出的煤的质量较差。
    末煤槽式洗煤机是洗选十五或十三公厘以下的末煤用的。这种槽子比较长，一般是十五到二十公尺，三个到四个槽子上下排列而成。槽上有十来个排渣箱排放重物，上槽排出的重物到下槽去洗选，这是因为煤粒细，难于和小矸石粒分开的缘故。块煤槽式洗煤机是处理六十到十三公厘块煤的。但煤质好的五十公厘以下的原煤也可以用来选洗。块煤槽式洗煤机一般长八至九公尺，有二个排渣箱；也有加长到十二到十三公尺，安三个排渣箱的。
