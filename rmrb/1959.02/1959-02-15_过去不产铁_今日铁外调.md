The Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, which historically relied on other regions for pig iron supply, has leaped forward in the Great Leap and become a region with pig iron for external transfer. In 1958, the entire prefecture supported major cities and industrial areas such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guiyang with more than 5,700 tons of high-quality iron. At present, pig iron from the autonomous prefecture is continuously being shipped from Miao and Dong villages to both inside and outside the province, to meet the needs of steelmaking.

For a long time, people believed that Qiandongnan did not produce iron and could only produce agricultural products such as timber, grain, and tobacco. Until 1957, only five of the sixteen counties in the entire prefecture produced some iron. In remote counties like Congjiang, in the past, due to inconvenient transportation, several blacksmith shops often relied on national loans to survive when the supply of raw iron from other places was not timely, affecting industrial and agricultural production. In 1958, after the Party Central Committee put forward the slogan of the whole people refining steel, a vigorous iron-smelting campaign was launched throughout the prefecture, changing the historically backward state. Every county in the prefecture produced iron. In 1958, more than 18,000 tons of qualified pig iron were produced, an increase of more than 23 times compared with 1957. At the same time, through the mass iron-smelting campaign, the number of iron-smelting technicians in the entire prefecture increased from 116 in 1957 to more than 6,500.

High-quality timber is continuously shipped to various places

    This newspaper reports that the people of all ethnic groups in Qiandongnan supported the economic construction of various parts of the country in 1958 with a large amount of high-quality timber.

    The Miao, Dong, Han, and other ethnic farmers in Qiandongnan produced about 650,000 cubic meters of timber in 1958, exceeding the total actual production during the First Five-Year Plan period by 68%. In addition to supporting the industrial construction and railway construction needs of the province, more than 180,000 cubic meters were transferred to other provinces. The construction of Tiananmen Square in Beijing, the Baotou and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plants, the Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia Hydropower Projects, and the harnessing of the Yellow River all used timber supported by this area.

    In the process of completing the timber production tasks, under the leadership of the Party, people carried forward the communist spirit and overcame various difficulties. More than 60,000 male and female workers on the forestry front, who have lived in the Miaoling Mountains and on the Qingshui River, the Duliu River, and the Yanghe River for a long time, traveled through the deep mountains and ridges, worked in the wind and rain, and completed the tasks assigned by the Party excellently. Yang Qiguang, the captain of the Linghu logging team in Jinping County, and Li Deshao worked with the workers to carry out technical innovations. Initially, when they used wooden rail flatcars to transport timber, some people had superstitious ideas, fearing that this would offend the "mountain god" and cause accidents. However, under the leadership of comrades such as Yang Qiguang, people broke superstition and promoted the "curved handle saw" in logging and adopted wooden rail flatcars and small river "herding" in transportation. In this way, the logging and transportation efficiency of the entire team of thirty-two people increased from the original 42 cubic meters per day to 120 cubic meters; by November 8 last year, they had overfulfilled the annual logging and transportation tasks by 29%. In the case of tight labor for transportation, farmers of all ethnic groups in the prefecture actively participated in timber transportation.

    The people of the prefecture also achieved simultaneous logging and afforestation, afforesting 11 million mu last year, exceeding ten times the total afforestation in the eight years since liberation.

    过去不产铁　今日铁外调
    本报讯　历史上从来靠外地供应生铁的黔东南苗族侗族自治州，在大跃进中一跃而为有生铁外调的地区。1958年全州支援北京、上海和贵阳等大城市、工业区的优质铁五千七百多吨。目前，自治州生铁正继续源源从苗乡侗寨运往省内外，供应炼钢需要。
    长久以来，人们认为黔东南不出铁，只能出产木材、粮食、烟叶等农产品。直到1957年，全州十六个县也只有五个县生产了一些铁。像从江这个边远县份，过去由于交通不便，一遇外地毛铁调入不及时，几个铁匠炉就常靠国家贷款过日子，影响工农业生产。1958年党中央提出全民炼钢铁口号后，全州开展声势浩大的炼铁运动，历史上遗留下来的落后状态改变了，全州县县生产铁。1958年共生产出合规格的生铁一万八千多吨，比1957年增加二十三倍多。同时通过群众炼铁运动，使全州炼铁技术工人由1957年的一百一十六人增加到了六千五百人以上。优质木材源源运往各地
    本报讯　黔东南各族人民在1958年用大量质量优良的木材，支援了全国各地经济建设。
    黔东南的苗、侗、汉等族农民1958年内生产木材六十五万立方公尺左右，超过第一个五年计划期中生产实绩总和的68％。这些木材，除了支援本省工业建设和铁路建设需要外，还调出外省十八万多立方公尺。在修建北京天安门、包头和石景山钢铁厂、三门峡和刘家峡水力发电工程以及治理黄河等工程中，都有这里支援的木材。
    在完成木材生产任务的过程中，人们在党的领导下，发扬了共产主义风格，克服了种种困难。长期生活在苗岭山脉和清水江、都柳江、?阳河上的林业战线上的六万多名男女职工，走遍深山峻岭，在风里、雨里，披星戴月，出色地完成了党交给的任务。锦屏县的岭湖采伐队队长杨启光和李德昭和工人们一道大搞技术革新。最初他们采用木轨平车运木材时，有些人存在迷信思想，怕这样做得罪“山神”，发生事故。但在杨启光等同志的带动下，人们破除了迷信，在采伐上推广“弯把锯”，在运输上采用木轨平车和小河“放羊”。这样，全队三十二个人的砍伐、调运效率，由原来每天四十二立方公尺提高到一百二十立方公尺；到去年11月8日止，就超额29％完成全年的采伐、调运任务。在调运劳力紧张的情况下，全州各族农民积极参加木材的运输工作。
    全州人民还做到砍伐和造林同时并举，去年造林一千一百万亩，超过解放八年来造林总和的十倍。
