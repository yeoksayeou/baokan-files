Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 3rd: The following is the full text of the speech by Comrade F. R. Kozlov, Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU, at the morning session of the 21st Congress of the CPSU on February 3rd:

    Comrades! The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will occupy a special place in the history of our Party. The great significance of this congress lies first and foremost in the fact that it unfolds a new stage in the development of Soviet society – the stage of comprehensive construction of communism.

    In Comrade N.S. Khrushchev's report, a magnificent program for the construction of communism was depicted very clearly and comprehensively, the current domestic and international situation of our country was analyzed profoundly, and a series of theoretical issues of Marxism-Leninism were explored.

    The characteristic of the period from the 20th Congress to the 21st Congress of the Party is the further growth of our country's power and the smooth advance of communist construction in all aspects.

    The Soviet people have the right to be proud of the truly heroic victories they have achieved in the country's economic and cultural construction. And the plan to comprehensively unfold communist construction in the next seven years unfolds even broader and brighter prospects before us. It is not surprising that these days the working people of socialist countries and millions of people around the world are watching the work of the congress, which is discussing the program for the vigorous development of the productive forces of our great motherland.
    The Seven-Year Plan is the Greatest Achievement of the Soviet Social System
    It Proves the Undoubted Superiority of the Socialist System
    All progressive mankind considers the Seven-Year Plan to be the greatest achievement of our social system. Our social system has proven with facts its undoubted superiority over capitalism and its ability to develop the economy at a high speed. We are pleased to see that our country, which was economically backward by fifty to one hundred years compared to the most developed capitalist countries before the revolution, has achieved unprecedented achievements in developing the socialist economy and culture in a very short historical period, despite the great damage caused by the wars imposed on us, and has become a great world power. It has set itself the task of catching up with and surpassing the richest capitalist country, the United States, in economic terms.

    You must know that neither Britain, nor any other of the most developed capitalist countries, would even dare to think of competing with the United States in terms of the level of development of productive forces. Only the Soviet Union can put forward this task. It has strong confidence in its bright future and bravely engages in peaceful competition with the United States, intending to win this competition in a short historical period. (Applause)

    In the face of the Soviet Union's extremely great achievements, all the defects and deformities of the economies of capitalist countries are even more prominent. Economic crises shake the capitalist countries, characterized by the anarchy of production and the constant struggle for sales markets and investment scopes, shaking their economies, intensifying and deepening domestic social contradictions, and deepening the relative impoverishment of the working people. Lacking confidence in the consolidation of their economic systems, the imperialists are trying to get rid of existing economic difficulties not through peaceful economic competition, but by strengthening the arms race, militarizing the economy, and preparing for new wars.

    We firmly oppose war. We advocate the immediate elimination of international tensions. The policy of peaceful coexistence is not a temporary phenomenon for us; it is a natural attribute of socialist society. The Soviet people need peace in order to realize the grand plans of communist construction. Peace - this is the basic content of our Leninist foreign policy.

    The Soviet Union is not advancing victoriously alone. The great People's Republic of China and other countries of the socialist camp are confidently advancing shoulder to shoulder with it. The world socialist system is a powerful force that has a huge impact on the entire process of international life. The dying struggles of all kinds of reformists and revisionists who try to slander and undermine the friendship and cooperation of the countries of the socialist camp and create divisions in the international communist movement are base and useless.

    These traitors engage in divisive activities to please the heads of the imperialist monopoly groups. They are like the barking dog in the famous Krylov fable: "Hey, how fierce, it barks and barks at the elephant!"

    The Party resolutely abandons everything that hinders further development
    Measures to Improve the Leadership of the National Economy Have Achieved Remarkable Results
    Comrades! The historically significant achievements of the Soviet Union in the development of the socialist economy are the result of the selfless creative labor of the Soviet people and the great political and organizational work of the Communist Party, which implements Lenin's general line. The tremendous measures taken by the Party in recent years to improve the leadership of the national economy have achieved remarkable results.

    Our achievements are great. These achievements demonstrate: the Communist Party has achieved great success by implementing the great Lenin's legacy, which in turn proves the infinite vitality of the socialist economic system. The socialist economy, unlike the capitalist economy, develops according to a unified plan based on scientific principles and in accordance with the requirements of objective economic laws; the working masses are closely concerned about the development of industry and agriculture, because the growth of products in socialist society will improve the material welfare of all the people. The secret of our achievements lies in the fact that the entire process of socialist development is led by the Marxist-Leninist Party, which, proceeding from specific historical conditions, scientifically summarizes and analyzes the results of economic development, opens up new roads, and resolutely abandons everything that is outdated and hinders further development. This is the significance of the Party's far-reaching and wise measures to reorganize the management of industry and construction, and to improve the leadership of agriculture. The implementation of these measures has not been long, and the Soviet people have achieved such great achievements in all aspects of socialist construction! These achievements are the guarantee for our country to continue to advance rapidly towards communism. It is not far off when the Soviet Union will jump to the first place in the world in terms of the absolute quantity of products and the quantity of products per capita. This will be the extremely great, world-historically significant victory of the entire socialist camp in the peaceful economic competition with capitalism.

    The completion of the Seven-Year Plan formulated by the Party will be of decisive significance for creating the material and technical foundation of communist society. The most important condition for solving this historical task is to ensure further technological progress in the national economy. When we talk about the peaceful economic competition between socialism and capitalism, we must always remember the great Lenin's instruction: "...whoever has strong technology, organization, discipline, and good machines will prevail..." Under capitalist conditions, technological progress, like the entire development of production, is subordinate to one purpose, that is, a handful of monopoly capitalists extracting maximum profits. Therefore, linked to technological progress is the intensification of the exploitation of the working class and the increase in unemployed workers.
    The Progress and Development of Technology in Socialist Countries
    Is Closely Related to the Creative Activities of Millions of People
    In socialist countries, technological progress has a completely different meaning. Here, the development of technology is closely related to the creative activities of millions of people and is subordinate to the interests of the people. The working people of socialist countries are directly concerned about improving technology, because this can improve productivity and improve working conditions, and can further improve the living standards of all the people.

    In socialist society, there is no private ownership of the means of production, and technological policy does not depend on the selfish interests of monopoly groups, but on the interests of the broadest masses of the people. Only in socialist society is it possible to have a true prosperity of science and technology. Speaking of this, please allow me to talk about some facts of the recent scientific and technological progress in the Soviet Union to illustrate this.

    Our country has opened up the road to outer space for mankind. The first phase of the nuclear power plant with a capacity of 600,000 kilowatts has been put into production. The newborn baby of the nuclear fleet—the nuclear icebreaker—has been launched. We have manufactured the world's fastest jet airliner and turboprop airliner. The world's largest V.I. Lenin Volga Hydropower Station has been supplying electricity to cities, factories, and construction projects. The first batch of units of the larger Stalingrad Hydropower Station has begun to work. The construction of giant thermal power plants is expanding more and more widely. A 200,000-kilowatt turbogenerator has been manufactured and is being installed, and a 300,000-kilowatt turbogenerator is now being manufactured. Highly efficient drilling equipment has been manufactured, which can greatly increase the extraction of oil and gas, especially in the eastern region. New computers have enriched modern technology. In order to equip industry, agriculture, transportation, and other economic sectors, more than 1,600 new modern machines, equipment, and machinery were created in 1958 alone.

    The control figure draft stipulates a magnificent program for basic construction. A large part of the investment will be used to expand and transform existing enterprises and replace old equipment with new and more efficient equipment.

    It is stipulated to greatly expand the Magnitogorsk and Kuznetsk Metallurgical Combine, the Kuibyshev Cement Plant and the "Giant" Factory, the Stalinogorsk, Voskresensk, and Rubizhansky Chemical Combine, the Yaroslavl Tire Factory, and many other enterprises. This makes it possible to greatly increase production capacity with less investment. For example, the cost required to increase the production capacity of the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine as stipulated in the plan can save the country more than 2 billion rubles compared with the cost of building a new factory with the same capacity.

    The production process will be fully mechanized and automated
    Heavy manual labor in industry will be completely eliminated
    The Seven-Year Plan stipulates the widespread adoption of new technologies, the full mechanization and automation of the production process, and the specialization and collaboration of all sectors of the national economy. At the same time, it must be noted that not only should individual production processes be mechanized and automated, but also more extensive measures should be taken in this regard.

    In seven years, heavy manual labor in industry will be completely eliminated. This is a major achievement of the Soviet people. Eliminating heavy manual labor can liberate a large number of workers from auxiliary work, which can eliminate the current abnormal situation, that is, more people are engaged in auxiliary work than in main production.

    It is stipulated to organize the highly specialized production of automated tools on a large scale in the next few years in order to realize further full automation of all sectors of the national economy.

    It is stipulated that more than half of the increase in labor productivity in seven years must be achieved through the adoption of new technologies. This actually means that a technological transformation will be carried out in all sectors of the national economy in seven years, and in many cases, this transformation has the nature of a true technological revolution.

    Our machine manufacturing industry plays a particularly important role in the technological transformation of various sectors of the national economy. It seems that in developing the machine manufacturing industry, we must proceed from the following basic guidelines:

    Manufacture machines and equipment that mechanize heavy work;

    Manufacture machines and units with higher productivity and more economic efficiency, especially automated equipment;

    Strengthen technological processes, develop and improve the specialization and collaboration of production, and reduce the unit consumption of metal.

    When equipping enterprises with metal processing machine tools, we must greatly increase the production of combined machine tools and special machine tools. In terms of productivity, one such machine tool can replace three to five universal machine tools. However, the proportion of combined machine tools and special machine tools in the total number of machine tools has hardly increased. The draft Seven-Year Plan stipulates a large increase in the production of this equipment.

    The automation of machine manufacturing production largely depends on the increase in the output of various types of automatic and semi-automatic metal cutting machine tools. As everyone knows, in order to achieve the full automation of machine manufacturing, the Seven-Year Plan stipulates that about 1,500 automatic and semi-automatic production lines should be manufactured to ensure that the instrument manufacturing industry can produce metal cutting machine tools with automatic progressive operation and highly precise machine tools in batches.

    The issue of fully mechanizing and automating the production process of wrought iron production is also worthy of serious attention. A lot of manual labor is used there, so the total time for using forging presses only accounts for 7% to 20%.

    The proportion of low-productivity machines—forging hammers—in the total number of forging presses is still very high. The weight of the steel billets forged by forging hammers is many times greater than the weight of the finished parts. Therefore, more progressive technological processes must be adopted in wrought iron production, that is, the method of heating the blanks in induction furnaces and gas furnaces first, and then stamping the forgings with mechanized stamping machines. The size and weight of the steel billets produced in this way are roughly the same as the finished parts, and the mechanical processing time can almost be reduced to one-half to one-third, and the amount of metal consumption can also be reduced by 30% to 50%.

    The modernization of equipment has great national economic significance. The experience of some enterprises proves that relying on modernization, the productivity of machine tools can be increased by 20%-30% with relatively little cost, and in individual cases, it can be increased by two times or even more than two times. For example, in the Moscow "Milling Cutter" tool factory, the productivity of machine tools has increased by two to four times due to the modernization of many machine tools.

    It is estimated that about 400,000 machine tools will be modernized in seven years. If the productivity of each machine tool increases by an average of only 25% due to modernization, then the economic effect generated in seven years will reach 10 billion rubles. The total cost of modernization is only about 2.8 billion rubles.

    The widespread use of the assembly line method of production can significantly increase the number of products. As everyone knows, the assembly line method can ensure better utilization of equipment and production area, balanced production of products, and greatly reduce the amount of labor when manufacturing products. Automobile factories, tractor factories, bearing factories, machine tool factories, and other factories that produce a large number of finished products use this method most effectively. The "Red Proletarian" factory has achieved positive results in using the assembly line method of production. There, the grouping assembly line method is used to manufacture parts that are similar in technology, which not only shortens the manufacturing cycle, but also greatly reduces the cost of the products. The labor productivity of this factory has increased by 45%-50% due to the implementation of the assembly line method in production.

    The widespread use of electronics and radio engineering in production
    Is one of the necessary conditions for the development of modern machine manufacturing
    An important task of machine manufacturing workers is to use more advanced technology and perfect equipment, improve the structure of machines, and greatly reduce the loss of metal when manufacturing parts. It is no secret that we lose more than 4.5 million tons of metal as shavings every year, and machine manufacturing plants lose about 25 billion rubles in this regard every year. Can we greatly reduce the loss of metal? We certainly can! To do this, in particular, it is necessary to: improve the precision of castings, forgings, and other steel billets and the smoothness of their surfaces, minimize mechanical processing, and completely eliminate mechanical processing for individual parts. One of the necessary conditions for the development of modern machine manufacturing is the widespread use of electronics and radio engineering in production. Otherwise, the automation and full mechanization of production cannot be successfully developed.

    The significance of radio electronics has increased especially due to the use of semiconductors. Replacing radio vacuum tubes with semiconductor instruments can significantly reduce the need for electrical energy, save precious non-ferrous metals and materials, reduce the volume and weight of instruments, improve reliability and extend the service life, and reduce operating costs. Due to the huge national economic significance of developing the production of semiconductor instruments, the Seven-Year Plan stipulates that existing factories of the semiconductor industry should be greatly expanded and new factories of the semiconductor industry should be built.

    The manufacture of fast electronic computers has created great possibilities for the automation of a large number of complex calculations and for more effective management of the production process. Now scientific research institutions can solve the most complex problems raised by science and technology in a short time.

    It is precisely with the help of fast electronic computers that it is possible to calculate the orbits of cosmic rockets and artificial earth satellites. Based on the materials measured on the ground, these machines can calculate the length of a large segment of the orbit of a cosmic rocket within 1.5-2 hours, while it takes dozens of hours for the cosmic rocket to fly through this segment. To illustrate the effectiveness of using these machines for calculation, another calculation problem related to rocket design can also be cited. To solve ten schemes of this problem, it takes ten mathematicians seven months to calculate with keyboard computers, while with the help of electric analog and digital computers, one hundred schemes of this problem can be solved by fewer experts in a week.

    Due to the automation of calculation work after the use of electronic computers, about 1 billion rubles were saved last year alone. It should be pointed out that the use of these machines greatly won the time for researching and manufacturing new technical equipment models. The application of electronic calculation devices to industry has improved the utilization efficiency of production units and greatly increased their operating speed. Therefore, the use of electronic computers and electronic control machines in the national economy will promote the more rapid development of our socialist economy.

    In the next seven years, a broad and comprehensive program of scientific research work has been determined, and it is stipulated to greatly expand the network of scientific research institutions, especially in the eastern regions of our country. In 1959 alone, 27.3 billion rubles will be allocated for the development of science. Such a scale of scientific research work can ensure the high-speed pace of further technological progress.

    Due to the growth of the oil industry and the gas industry, replacing steam turbines with gas turbines in power stations is of great significance at present. Comrade N.S. Khrushchev's report emphasized the importance of this issue.

    The "Thermal Power Plant Design Institute" compared the technical and economic indicators of two power stations: one is a steam turbine power station, which is equipped with four turbine units with a power generation capacity of 150,000 kilowatts per unit, and the other is a gas turbine power station with the same power generation capacity, which is equipped with six units with a power generation capacity of 100,000 kilowatts. This comparison shows that with the use of steam turbine equipment, the metal consumption per kilowatt of design power is 43 kilograms, while with the use of gas turbines, it is only 24 kilograms, that is to say, it is almost reduced by half. At the same time, the unit volume of buildings is also reduced by one-third.

    We must strengthen our work in this regard and do our best to assist our scientists and designers, and assist them in accelerating the design and application of huge gas turbines to meet the needs of large thermal power plants and other sectors of the national economy.

    Many other facts can also be cited. What do they show? First of all, they show that we have huge economic potential. By using these potentials, we can accelerate the realization of the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan, save millions of tons of steel in processing, improve labor productivity, improve quality, and reduce the cost of industrial products.

    The Party has always believed that it is necessary to do everything possible to improve labor productivity
    This is a necessary condition for winning the competition with capitalism
    Comrades! The Communist Party has believed in the past and still believes that realizing Lenin's legacy - doing everything possible to improve social labor productivity is a necessary condition for winning the competition with capitalism, and it is of paramount importance. V.I. Lenin pointed out that socialism should achieve a high level of labor productivity in its own way, with its own Soviet methods.

    The capitalists raise labor productivity in their enterprises by such methods as: artificially selecting the healthiest and most hard-working workers, maximizing labor intensity, thereby exhausting all the strength of the workers and making them destined to premature aging and death. These methods are incompatible with socialist society.

    The working people of our country work for themselves and for their society. Therefore, they are closely concerned about the improvement of labor productivity, and believe that this is a solid foundation for the improvement of their living standards. We must always remember that we enthusiastically adopt new technologies, not for the sake of technology itself, but to make the labor of the Soviet people produce greater production results, and on this basis, defeat capitalism in the peaceful economic competition.

    In terms of the growth rate of labor productivity, our country is ahead of capitalist countries. The labor productivity in our country's industry grows by 6%-7% every year, while in the industry of the United States, the most developed capitalist country, it only grows by 1.5%-2%. But do not forget that in terms of the level of labor productivity, the Soviet Union is still behind the United States, so we still have to do a lot of work in order to catch up with and surpass the United States in this decisive aspect.

    In seven years, the labor productivity in industry will increase by 45%-50% per worker. In order to successfully solve the task put forward by the Party in improving labor productivity, we should concentrate our efforts on realizing the Party's program of adopting new technologies, fully automating and mechanizing the production process, modernizing equipment, improving technological processes, specializing enterprises, and improving labor organization.

    The further improvement of the technical proficiency and technical knowledge of workers and intellectuals engaged in production is one of the decisive factors in the growth of labor productivity.

    In the years since the establishment of Soviet power, excellent expert cadres have grown up in our country. They are proficient in their business and can solve the most complex production, economic, and scientific and technological tasks. There are more than 7 million experts with higher and secondary professional education working in the national economy. The cultural and technical level of the working class has been greatly improved. They have proved that they are capable of managing modern types of machines and equipment and various complex production processes. Hundreds of thousands of innovators in socialist production have become the creators of technological progress.
    The Creative Genius of the Soviet Working People Shocked the World
    Has Been in a Leading Position in the Most Important Departments of Science and Technology
    How can we not be delighted that our powerful Soviet people are currently in a leading position in the most important departments of modern science and technology. The creative genius of the Soviet people and their love for labor are a reliable guarantee for our continued rapid progress and for seizing the first place in the world in science and technology. (Applause)

    The era when the Russian workers, who were ruthlessly exploited by landlords and capitalists, deeply sang the well-known "Barge Haulers' Song" in heavy slave labor is gone forever. Everyone still remembers that the song talked about the "smart Englishmen" inventing one machine after another, while our Russian peasants were "exhausted" and had to sing their favorite "Barge Haulers' Song". This song had profound social significance at that time. It reflected the technological backwardness of pre-revolutionary Russia and the heavy labor conditions of Russian workers. The atmosphere expressed in this song is gone forever. How far has our motherland advanced. Now, it is no longer the "smart Englishmen", but our Soviet working people who have shocked the world with their creative genius and were the first to manufacture artificial earth satellites and artificial solar system planets. (Applause)

    Now, in many of the most important scientific and technological departments, not only countries like Britain, but even the United States have to catch up with the Soviet Union. In terms of production level and labor productivity, we have surpassed Britain and have set ourselves the task of catching up with and surpassing the United States in this regard in the near future.

    The moving prospects for the technological transformation of all sectors of the national economy depicted in Comrade N.S. Khrushchev's report enable us to achieve higher productivity than capitalism and obtain abundant products. Moreover, unlike capitalist countries, where labor was and is a heavy burden for workers, in our country, labor is gradually becoming a need in people's lives.

    There is no doubt that we have made significant achievements in improving labor productivity. However, we will not talk about it here. We must look forward and remember that we must take a greater step forward in improving labor productivity in seven years. You must know that three-quarters of the expected total increase in industrial products comes from this.

    We cannot be satisfied with the average figure of labor productivity growth, but we must make the labor productivity of every enterprise, every collective farm and state farm, every workshop, every section, and every work area grow.

    We cannot continue to tolerate the shortcomings in improving production technology, improving labor productivity, and reducing product costs. The results of the work of each enterprise should be evaluated not only according to the total output value, but also according to these most important indicators.

    The realistic guarantee for completing the task of improving labor productivity is, first of all, to take extensive measures to improve the technical level of production. The working experience of many enterprises proves that our economy has great potential for greatly improving labor productivity, and we also have great potential in this regard.

    The Seven-Year Plan stipulates to greatly increase the actual income of employees
    The growth of labor productivity must exceed the growth of wages
    When talking about improving labor productivity, it must be emphasized that the control figures stipulate that the actual income of workers and staff should be greatly increased. In seven years, the average income of each employee will increase by 40% due to the increase in monetary wages, preferential treatment, subsidies, and further reduction in the price of food in public catering.

    The task put forward by the Party—to complete the work of adjusting the wages of employees in all sectors of the national economy that was started in accordance with the resolution of the 20th Congress of the CPSU—is of great significance for improving labor productivity and improving the welfare of the working people. This adjustment not only means eliminating the many shortcomings caused by the former competent authorities in charge of industry and construction in stipulating labor quotas and remuneration, but also means greatly increasing the income of low-wage and medium-wage employees, thereby shortening the distance in labor remuneration between low-wage and medium-wage staff and high-wage staff.

    In order to continuously expand production and improve the welfare of the working people on this basis, the growth of labor productivity must exceed the growth of wages. However, unfortunately, the leaders of many national economic committees and enterprises tolerate the overspending of the wage fund. Ensuring that the growth of labor productivity exceeds the growth of wages is the unwavering law of every enterprise and construction project, and it is a condition for the rapid development of social production and the further improvement of the welfare of the working people.

    Comrades! The mission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as the leading force of the Soviet state, is to lead the people to fight for the successful realization of the great plan for comprehensively unfolding communist construction in our country. Therefore, it is extremely important to further improve the Party's organizational work among the masses.

    The 20th Congress of our Party stipulated a magnificent program for the further development of our country. The anti-Party group attempted to sabotage the implementation of the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU. It opposed some very important and very urgent measures, such as reclaiming virgin and wasteland, the revision of the national economic plan, especially the plan for agricultural production, the reorganization of the management of industry and construction, and the expansion of the power of the party organizations and Soviet organs in various union republics and localities. The despicable factionalists even opposed the measures to exempt collective farmers, workers and staff with private plots of land from purchasing agricultural products, and opposed measures to further improve the welfare of the working people. All these measures were implemented on the initiative of Comrade N.S. Khrushchev. Despite the opposition of the anti-Party group, he implemented these measures with fortitude, resolutely and courageously with the support of our entire Party and all the people. (Applause)

    The basis of the anti-Party group's position is that its participants were captured by the old ideas and methods of being divorced from the life of the Party and the state, could not see the new conditions and new situations, showed conservatism, clung to the work forms and methods that had become outdated and did not conform to the interests of advancing towards communism, and opposed what arose in life and conformed to the interests of the development of Soviet society and the interests of the entire socialist camp.

    After smashing and discarding this small group of splitters and factionalists, our Party further consolidated its ranks and raised higher the great banner of Marxism-Leninism.

    Under this glorious and invincible banner, our working class, under the leadership of the Leninist Party, opened a new era in world history in October 1917. Under this banner, we are now entering a new and extremely important period in the development of our country - the period of comprehensively unfolding communist construction.

    Under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, we are advancing with confidence and unswervingly, opening up a bright and great future for all mankind - the road to the victory of communism.
(Stormy and prolonged applause)

    苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员
    科兹洛夫在苏共二十一次代表大会上的发言
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社莫斯科3日讯：苏共中央主席团委员弗·罗·科兹洛夫同志在苏共第二十一次代表大会2月3日上午会议上的发言。全文如下：
    同志们！苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会在我们党的历史上将占有特殊的位置。这次代表大会的伟大意义首先在于，它在苏维埃社会的发展中展开了一个新的阶段——全面建设共产主义的阶段。
    在尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的报告中，极明确而全面地描绘出共产主义建设的宏伟纲领，深刻地分析了当前我国的国内和国际形势，探讨了一系列马克思列宁主义的理论问题。
    从党的第二十次代表大会到第二十一次代表大会这一时期的特点，是我国威力的进一步增长，共产主义建设在一切方面顺利地向前迈进。
    苏联人民有权为自己在国家的经济和文化建设中所取得的真正英雄般的胜利而自豪。而预定的在最近七年中全面展开共产主义建设的计划，在我们面前展开了更加广阔而光明的前景。这些天来社会主义各国的劳动人民以及全世界千百万人们都在注视着正在讨论我们伟大祖国的生产力蓬勃发展的纲领的代表大会的工作，这是不奇怪的。
    七年计划是苏联社会制度最伟大的成就
    它证明社会主义制度的优越性无庸置疑
    全体进步人类认为七年计划是我们的社会制度的最伟大的成就，我们的社会制度以事实证明了自己比资本主义有无容置疑的优越性，有能力高速度地发展经济。我们高兴地看到，革命前在经济方面比最发达的资本主义各国落后五十至一百年的我国，尽管强加于我们的战争使我们受到极大的破坏，在极短的历史时期内在发展社会主义的经济和文化方面取得了空前的成就，变成了伟大的世界强国，它给自己提出一项任务——在经济方面赶上并超过最富强的资本主义国家——美国。
    要知道，无论英国，无论任何其它的最发达的资本主义国家甚至连想也不敢想要和美国在生产力发展水平方面进行竞争。只有苏联才能提出这项任务，它对自己的光明的未来具有坚强的信心，勇敢地同美国进行和平竞赛，打算在短短的历史时期内赢得这场竞赛。（鼓掌）
    在苏联极伟大的成就的面前，资本主义各国经济上的一切缺陷和畸形状态就表现得更为突出。经济危机摇撼着以生产的无政府状态和不断争夺销售市场和投资范围为特征的资本主义各国，振荡着它们的经济，加剧和加深了国内的社会矛盾，加深了劳动人民的相对贫困化。帝国主义者对自己的经济制度的巩固缺乏信心，他们不是用和平的经济竞赛的方法，而是企图通过加强军备竞赛、经济的军国主义化和准备新战争来摆脱现存的经济困难。
    我们坚决反对战争。我们主张立即消除国际紧张局势。和平共处的政策对我们说来，不是什么暂时的现象，它是社会主义社会天然的属性。苏联人民需要和平，以便实现共产主义建设的各项宏伟的计划。和平——这是我们的列宁主义对外政策的基本内容。
    苏联并不是单枪匹马地胜利前进的。伟大的中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营的其他国家正满怀信心地与它并肩前进。世界社会主义体系，这是强大的力量，它对国际生活的全部过程发生巨大的影响。各式各样的改良主义者和修正主义者力图诽谤和破坏社会主义阵营各国的友谊合作和在国际共产主义运动中制造分裂，这种垂死挣扎是卑鄙的、无用的。
    这些叛徒进行分裂活动，讨好帝国主义垄断集团的头子，他们像著名的克雷洛夫寓言中的叭儿狗一样：“嘿，真厉害，它还向大象乱吠乱叫呢！”
    党坚决抛弃一切阻碍进一步发展的东西
    改善国家经济领导工作的措施成绩显著
    同志们！苏联在社会主义经济发展中取得的有世界历史意义的成就，是由于苏联人民进行了忘我的创造性劳动，由于贯彻执行列宁的总路线的共产党进行了巨大的政治组织工作的结果。近几年来党所执行的关于改善国家经济领导工作的巨大措施获得了显著的成绩。
    我们的成就是巨大的。这些成就说明了：共产党由于实现了伟大列宁的遗训而获得了极大的成功，这又证明了社会主义经济体系的无穷的生命力。社会主义的经济与资本主义的经济不同，它是按照有科学根据并符合于客观经济规律要求的统一计划而发展的；劳动群众密切关怀工业和农业的发展，这是因为社会主义社会中产品的增长会使全体人民的物质福利提高。我们获得成就的秘密在于：社会主义发展的全部过程是马克思列宁主义的党领导的，它从具体的历史条件出发，科学地概括和分析了经济发展的结果，开辟了新的道路，坚决地抛弃了一切陈旧过时的、阻碍进一步发展的东西。这就是党所采取的关于改组工业和建筑业的管理、改善农业领导的、深远而英明的措施的意义。这些措施的执行并不久，而苏联人民在社会主义建设的一切方面获
  得了多么巨大的成就！这些成就是我们国家向共产主义继续迅速前进的保证。苏联在产品的绝对数量和按人口计算的产品数量方面跃居世界第一位，已为期不远了。这将是整个社会主义阵营在与资本主义的和平经济竞赛中极伟大的、具有世界历史意义的胜利。
    党所制订的七年计划的完成对于创立共产主义社会的物质技术基础将具有决定性的意义。解决这一历史任务的最重要条件是保证国民经济中的进一步的技术进步。当我们谈到社会主义与资本主义的和平经济竞赛时，必须经常想到伟大列宁的指示：“……谁有强大的技术、组织性、纪律和好的机器，谁就占上风……”在资本主义条件下，技术进步也像生产的整个发展一样，是服从于一个目的，即一小撮垄断资本家榨取最大限度的利润，因此，与技术进步联系着的是对工人阶级的剥削的加强和失业工人的增加。
      社会主义国家中技术的进步和发展
      同千百万人的创造活动有密切联系
    在社会主义国家中，技术进步具有完全不同的意义。在这里，技术的发展同千百万人的创造性活动有密切的联系，并且服从于人民的利益。社会主义国家的劳动人民直接关心改进技术，因为这能够提高生产率和改善劳动条件，能够使全体人民的生活水平进一步提高。
    在社会主义社会中，没有生产资料的私有制，技术政策不是取决于垄断集团的自私的利益，而是取决于最广大人民群众的利益，只有在社会主义社会中才有可能有科学和技术的真正繁荣。谈到这里，请允许我谈一谈苏联最近科学技术进步的一些事实来说明这一点。
    我国为人类开辟了通向宇宙空间的道路。功率为六十万瓩的原子能发电站的第一期工程已经投入生产。原子船队的初生子——原子破冰船已经下水。我们制造出世界上最快的喷气客机和涡轮喷气客机。世界最大的弗·伊·列宁伏尔加水电站已经为城市、工厂、建筑工程供电。功率更大的斯大林格勒水电站的第一批机组已经开始工作。日益广泛地展开了巨型火电站的建设。功率为二十万瓩的涡轮发电机已经制成并开始安装，现在正在制造功率为三十万瓩的涡轮发电机。制成了高效率的钻井设备，这可以大大增加石油和瓦斯的开采量，特别是在东部地区。新的计算机充实了现代技术。为了装备工业、农业、运输业和其他经济部门，仅在1958年就创制了一千六百多种新的现代化机器、装备和机械。
    控制数字草案中规定了基本建设的宏伟纲领。很大一部分投资将用来扩建和改造现有企业，用新的、效率更高的装备来代替旧装备。
    规定要大力扩建马格尼托哥尔斯克和库兹涅茨克冶金联合厂、古比雪夫水泥厂和“巨人”工厂、斯大林诺哥尔斯克、沃斯克烈先斯克、卢比让斯克化学联合厂、雅罗斯拉夫轮胎工厂和许多其他企业。这样就有可能在少投资的情况下大大提高生产能力。例如，计划规定的提高马格尼托哥尔斯克冶金联合厂的生产能力所需的费用，同建设具有同等能力的新工厂所需的费用相比较，可以给国家节省二十多亿卢布。
    生产过程将实行全盘机械化和自动化
    工业中的繁重手工劳动将被完全消除
    七年计划规定广泛采用新技术，生产过程实行全盘机械化和自动化，国民经济一切部门实行专业化和协作。同时必须注意到，不仅是要把个别生产过程实行机械化和自动化，而且要在这方面实行更广泛的措施。
    在七年中，工业中繁重的手工劳动将被完全消除。这是苏联人民的一大成就。消除繁重的手工劳动就可以把大量工人从辅助性工作中解放出来，这样就可以消灭目前存在的一种不正常的状况，即从事辅助工作的人多于从事主要生产的人。
    规定在最近几年内大规模地组织自动化工具的高度专业化的生产，以便实现国民经济一切部门进一步全盘自动化。
    规定在七年中间劳动生产率的增长额有一半以上须靠采用新技术来实现。这实际上意味着在七年中对国民经济一切部门实行技术改革，而且在许多场合这种改革带有真正技术革命的性质。
    我国机器制造业在国民经济各部门的技术改革中起着特别重要的作用。看来，在发展机器制造业方面我们必须从下列基本方针出发：
    制造使笨重工作机械化的机器和装备；
    制造生产率更高的和经济上更合算的机器和机组，特别是自动化装备；
    强化工艺过程，发展和改进生产的专业化和协作，降低金属的单位消耗量。
    在用金属加工机床来装备企业时，必须大力增加联动机床和专门机床的生产。按生产率讲，一个这样的机床可以代替三个到五个万能机床。但是，联动机床和专门机床在机床总数中的比重几乎没有增加。七年计划草案中规定大力增加这种装备的生产量。
    机器制造业生产的自动化在很大程度上取决于各个类型的自动和半自动金属切削机床产量的增加。大家知道，为了实现机器制造业的全盘自动化，七年计划规定要制造约一千五百个自动和半自动作业线，保证仪器制造业能够成批生产带有自动递进操纵的金属切削机床和高度精密的机床。
    关于锻铁生产的生产过程实行全盘机械化和自动化的问题也值得认真注意，那里使用很多手工劳动，因此使用锻压机的时间总共只占7％到20％。
    生产率低的机器——锻锤在锻压机总数中所占的比重仍然很高。用锻锤锻出的钢坯比成件的重量大好多倍。因此，在锻铁生产中必须更坚决地采用进步的工艺过程，即采用先把毛坯在感应电炉和煤气炉中加热，然后再用机械化冲压机冲压的方法来生产锻件坯。这样生产出的钢坯的尺寸和重量大致和成件相同，以后机械加工的时间几乎可以缩减到二分之一到三分之一，金属的耗费量也可以减少30％到50％。
    设备的现代化具有巨大的国民经济意义。一些企业的经验证明：依靠现代化用比较不多的花费就可以使机床的生产率提高20％—30％，在个别情况下，可以提高到二倍，甚至二倍以上。例如，在莫斯科“铣刀”工具制造厂内由于许多机床的现代化，机床的生产率提高到二到四倍。
    七年间预计约有四十万台机床实行现代化。如果每一台机床的生产率由于实行现代化平均只提高25％，那末，七年内所产生的经济效果将达到一百亿卢布。而现代化所需的费用总共才二十八亿卢布左右。
    广泛地采用生产的流水作业法，可以使产品数量显著增加。大家知道，流水作业法可以保证更好地利用设备、生产面积，均衡地生产产品，大大地降低制造产品时的劳动量。汽车工厂、拖拉机厂、轴承厂、机床制造厂以及其他大批出产成品的工厂使用这种方法最有成效。“红色无产者”工厂在运用生产的流水作业法上取得了肯定的成绩。那里用分组流水作业法制造在工艺上相近的零件，这不仅缩短了制造的循环过程，而且也大大降低了产品的成本。这个工厂由于在生产中实施了流水作业法，劳动生产率提高了45％—50％。
    在生产中广泛运用电子学和无线电工学
    是发展现代机器制造业的必要条件之一
    机器制造工人的重要任务是：使用更先进的技术和完善的装备，改进机器的构造，在制造零件时要使金属的损耗大大缩减。我们每年有四百五十万吨以上金属成为刨屑，机器制造厂在这方面每年约损失二百五十亿卢布，这不是什么秘密。我们能不能大大地缩减金属的损耗呢？一定能！要做到这一点，特别是需要：提高铸件、锻件和其他钢坯的精密度和它们表面的光滑程度，最大限度地缩小机械加工，对于个别的零件则完全取消机械加工。发展现代机器制造业的必要条件之一是在生产中广泛地运用电子学和无线电工学。否则，生产的自动化和全盘机械化就不能顺利发展。
    无线电电子学的意义特别是由于半导体的使用而增大了。用半导体的仪器代替无线电真空管，就有可能显著地缩减电能的需要，节省珍贵的有色金属和材料、缩小仪器的体积和重量，提高可靠性和延长使用期限、降低经营费用。由于发展半导体仪器的生产有巨大的国民经济意义，所以在七年计划中规定要大力扩大现有的半导体工业的工厂和建设新的半导体工业的工厂。
    快速电子计算机的制成，为大量的繁复计算的自动化和为生产过程的更有效的管理创造了极大的可能性。现在科学研究机关能够在短时间内解决科学和技术所提出的最复杂的问题。
    正是借助于快速电子计算机，才有可能计算宇宙火箭和地球卫星的轨道。根据地上测量的材料，这些机器可以在1.5—2小时内计算出宇宙火箭轨道的一大段的长度，而宇宙火箭飞完这段距离需要几十小时。为了说明使用这些机器计算的效能，还可以举出一个与火箭设计有关的算题。解决这个问题的十个方案，需要十个数学家用键盘计算机计算七个月，而借助于电模拟和数字计算机，这个问题的一百个方案只要更少的专家在一星期内就可解决。
    由于计算工作采用了电子计算机后自动化了，仅去年一年就节省了约十亿卢布。应该指出：这些机器的使用大大地赢得了研究和制造新技术装备模型的时间。电子计算装置运用于工业，提高了生产机组的利用效能，大大地增加了它们的运转速度。因此，在国民经济中使用电子计算机和电子控制机，将促进我们社会主义经济的更迅速的发展。
    在今后七年内，确定了广泛的全面的科学研究工作纲领，并规定了大大扩大科学研究机关网，特别是在我国的东部地区。仅仅在1959年内，为了发展科学就要拨出二百七十三亿卢布。如此规模的科学研究工作可以保证进一步的技术进步的高速步伐。
    由于石油工业和瓦斯工业的增长，在电站中用燃气轮机代替蒸汽轮机在目前具有重要的意义。在尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的报告中着重指出了这一问题的重要性。
    “火电站设计院”比较了两个电站的技术经济指标：一个是蒸汽轮机电站，它装备有每组发电能力为十五万瓩的四个轮机组，另一个是发电能力相同的燃气轮机电站，它装备六个发电能力为十万瓩的机组。这个比较表明：利用蒸汽轮机设备，每一瓩设计功率的金属消耗是四十三公斤，而利用燃气轮机只有二十四公斤，这就是说，几乎减少了二分之一。同时建筑物的单位容积也缩小了三分之一。
    在这方面必须加强工作，尽力协助我们的科学家、设计师，协助他们加速设计和运用巨大的燃气轮机，以适应大型火电站以及其他国民经济部门的需要。
    还可以举出不少其它的事实。它们说明什么呢？首先，说明我们在经济上拥有巨大的潜力，利用这些潜力，就可以加速实现七年计划的任务，在加工时节约成百万吨的钢材，提高劳动生产率，提高质量和降低工业产品的成本。
    党一向认为必须尽力提高劳动生产率
    这是和资本主义竞赛致胜的必要条件
    同志们！共产党过去和现在都认为，实现列宁的遗训——尽力提高社会劳动生产率是和资本主义竞赛致胜的必要条件，是有头等重要的意义。弗·伊·列宁指出，社会主义应该按照自己的方式，以自己的苏维埃的方法来达到高度的劳动生产率。
    资本家在其企业中是靠这样一些方法来提高劳动生产率的：人为地挑选最健康和最吃苦耐劳的工人、最大限度地提高劳动强度，从而耗尽工人的一切力量并使他们注定要过早地衰老和死亡，这些方法是和社会主义社会格格不入的。
    我国的劳动人民是为自己、为自己的社会工作，因此他们密切关心劳动生产率的提高，认为这是他们的生活水平提高的牢固的基础。必须永远记住，我们热心采用新的技术，不是为了技术的本身，而是为了使苏联人的劳动产生更大的生产效果，并在这种基础上在和平的经济竞赛中战胜资本主义。
    按劳动生产率的增长速度来说，我国走在资本主义各国的前面。我国工业中劳动生产率每年增长6％—7％，而在美国这个最发达的资本主义国家的工业中仅仅增长1.5％—2％。但是不要忘记，按劳动生产率的水平来说，苏联还落后于美国，所以我们还必须做许多工作，以便在这个决定性的方面赶上并超过美国。
    七年内，工业中的劳动生产率按每个劳动者来计算，要增长45％—50％。为了顺利地解决党在提高劳动生产率方面所提出的任务，我们应该集中力量实现党所规定的采用新技术、生产过程实行全盘自动化和机械化、设备现代化、改善工艺过程、企业专业化，以及改善劳动组织的纲领。
    工人和从事生产的知识分子的技术熟练程度和技术知识的进一步提高，是劳动生产率增长的决定性因素之一。
    在苏维埃政权存在的年代中，优秀的专家干部在我国成长起来了，他们精通业务，能够解决最复杂的生产经济和科学技术任务。国民经济中有七百多万个受过高等和中等专业教育的专家在工作。工人阶级的文化和技术水平无比地提高了，他们已经证明了自己有能力管理现代各种类型的机器和设备以及各种复杂的生产过程。几十万社会主义生产革新者成为技术进步的创造者。
      苏联劳动人民的创造天才震惊全世界
    在科学技术最重要部门已居领导地位
    我们强大的苏联人民目前在现代科学和技术的最重要部门方面居于领导的地位，这怎能不令人欢欣鼓舞。苏联人民的创造天才和对劳动的热爱，是我们继续迅速前进、在世界科学和技术方面夺取首位的可靠保证。（掌声）
    受到地主资本家无情剥削的俄国劳动者，在沉重的奴役劳动中深沉地唱着众所周知的“船夫曲”的时代一去不复返了。大家还记得，歌子里讲到“聪明的英国人”发明了一个又一个的机器，而我们俄国庄稼汉“累得有气无力”，只得唱心爱的“船夫曲”。这支歌在当时有着深刻的社会意义，它反映了革命前俄国技术的落后和俄国劳动者的沉重的劳动条件。现在这支歌中所表现的那种气氛已经一去不复返了，我们的祖国前进得多么远了。现在，已经不是“聪明的英国人”，而是我们苏联劳动人民以自己的创造天才震惊了全世界，第一个制成了人造地球卫星和人造太阳系行星。（掌声）
    现在，在许多最重要的科学和技术部门方面，不仅像英国这样的国家，甚至于美国也不得不追赶苏联。在生产水平和劳动生产率方面，我们已经超过英国，并给自己提出任务，要在不久的将来在这方面赶上并超过美国。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志报告中所描绘的对一切国民经济部门实行技术改革的动人前景，使我们能够达到比资本主义更高的生产率，获得丰富的产品。而且，我们和资本主义各国不同，在那里过去和现在劳动都是工人的重担，在我国劳动逐渐成为人们的生活需要。
    毫无疑问，在提高劳动生产率方面，我们已取得了重大的成就。然而这里不去谈它。我们要向前看，要记住，七年中在提高劳动生产率方面要更大大地前进一步。要知道，预计工业产品全部增产量的四分之三是靠这一点得来的。
    我们不能满足于劳动生产率增长的平均数字，而要使每个企业、每个集体农庄和国营农场、每个车间、每个工段、每个工区的劳动生产率都增长。
    我们不能继续容忍在改进生产技术、提高劳动生产率和降低产品成本方面的缺点。每一个企业的工作的结果不仅应当根据总产量来评价，而且要根据这些最重要的指标来评价。
    完成提高劳动生产率的任务的现实保证，首先是采取广泛的措施来提高生产的技术水平。许多企业的工作经验证明，我国经济具有大大地提高劳动生产率的巨大可能性，在这方面我们也拥有巨大的潜力。
    七年计划规定大大提高职工的实际收入
    劳动生产率的增长必须超过工资的增长
    在谈到提高劳动生产率时，必须强调指出，控制数字中规定要大大提高工人和职员的实际收入，在七年中，由于货币工资、优抚金、补助金的增加以及公共饮食业食品价格的进一步降低，每个职工的平均收入将增加40％。
    党所提出的任务——完成根据苏共第二十次代表大会的决议而开始进行的调整一切国民经济部门职工工资的工作——对于提高劳动生产率和提高劳动人民的福利有重大的意义。这种调整不仅意味着消除过去管理工业和建筑业的主管机构在规定劳动定额和报酬方面所造成的许多缺点，而且还意味着大大提高低工资和中等工资的职工的收入，从而缩短低工资和中等工资工作人员同高工资工作人员在劳动报酬上的距离。
    为了不断扩大生产和在这个基础上提高劳动人民的福利，劳动生产率的增长必须超过工资的增长。但是，可惜许多国民经济委员会和企业的领导者却容忍超额支出工资基金。保证劳动生产率的增长超过工资的增长，是每一个企业和建筑工程的确定不移的法律，是迅速发展社会生产和进一步提高劳动人民的福利的条件。
    同志们！作为苏维埃国家的领导力量的苏联共产党的使命是：领导人民为顺利实现在我国全面展开共产主义建设的伟大规划而斗争。所以，进一步改进党在群众中的组织工作极为重要。
    我们党的第二十次代表大会规定了使我国进一步发展的宏伟纲领。反党集团曾企图破坏苏共第二十次代表大会决议的执行，它反对下面一些非常重要的和非常迫切的措施，如开垦生熟荒地，国民经济计划、特别是农业生产方面的计划的修改，对工业和建筑业管理的改组，扩大各加盟共和国和地方党组织以及苏维埃机关的权力。卑鄙的派别活动分子甚至反对免除向有宅旁园地的集体农民、工人和职员征购农产品的措施，反对进一步提高劳动人民福利的措施。所有这些措施都是根据尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的倡议而实行的，他不顾反党集团的反对，在我们全党和全体人民的支持下刚毅地、坚决地和勇敢地实行了这些措施。（掌声）
    反党集团立场的基础就是，它的参加者都作了脱离党和国家生活的旧观念和方法的俘虏，看不见新的条件、新的形势，表现出了保守主义，死抓住已经过时的、不符合向共产主义前进的利益的工作形式和方法，反对生活中所产生的东西，反对合乎苏维埃社会发展的利益和整个社会主义阵营的利益的东西。
    我们党在粉碎和抛弃了这一小撮分裂分子和派别活动分子以后，更加巩固了自己的队伍和更高地举起了马克思列宁主义的伟大旗帜。
    在这个光荣的和不可战胜的旗帜下，我国的工人阶级曾经在列宁党的领导下，在1917年10月开辟了世界历史的新纪元。在这个旗帜下，我们现在进入我国发展的新的极重要的时期——全面展开共产主义建设的时期。
    在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，我们满怀信心地和坚定不移地前进，为全人类开辟了走向光明伟大的未来——走向共产主义胜利的道路。
  （暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
