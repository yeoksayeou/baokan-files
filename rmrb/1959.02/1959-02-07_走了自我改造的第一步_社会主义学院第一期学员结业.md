Xinhua News Agency, 6th -- The first class of students from the Socialist Academy, sponsored by the National Committee of the CPPCC, held its graduation ceremony today. The students, from various democratic parties—all of whom are responsible personnel at various levels of the democratic parties—have undergone more than two years of study. Most have achieved varying degrees of progress in political and ideological remolding. They are about to embark on their work posts and continue to contribute to socialist construction.

	The Socialist Academy is a school with a special format. Here, students, based on the principle of voluntariness, conduct political and ideological remolding within a concentrated period of time through the study of Marxism-Leninism and the methods of criticism and self-criticism, in order to change their standpoints, viewpoints, and ways of understanding issues.

	The Socialist Academy began in October 1956, and the class graduating this time consists of more than 130 students. Wu Yuzhang, president of the Socialist Academy, spoke at the graduation ceremony. He said that after more than two years of study, most students have made varying degrees of progress in politics and ideology, and some have made rapid and significant progress, even becoming leftists. It can be said that the gains are significant. However, he said, the political stance of most people has not yet broken away from the middle state, and some have made little progress, or even remained in their original state, but naturally this is only a small number. He said that through study, most students have a relatively correct view of themselves in terms of self-awareness, admitting that they have two sides on the issue of socialist revolution, admitting that their bourgeois standpoint has not been completely abandoned, and expressing their willingness to accept socialist remolding. Many people have begun to analyze problems from a class perspective. Wu Yuzhang said that this is a manifestation of awakening, and it is the first step in remolding oneself. Secondly, on the issue of the enemy and ourselves, most students have a relatively deep understanding, and many can distinguish themselves from the rightists. Thirdly, most students have also improved their ability to identify the struggle between the two roads within the people, and expressed their willingness to stand on the correct side, strengthen remolding, and take the socialist road. Wu Yuzhang spoke of the last gain, that most students have begun to get used to criticism and self-criticism, and realized that criticism and self-criticism are an extremely important weapon for self-remolding. Wu Yuzhang emphasized that it should be affirmed that the gains are huge, but these gains are only the first step in self-remolding. In order to further strengthen remolding, Wu Yuzhang encouraged everyone to recognize the situation, raise awareness, master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and continue to carry out political and ideological remolding in the future.

	Wu Yuzhang finally said that after graduation, most of the students will return to their original work posts. He hoped that all people will continue to seize the task of remolding themselves through practice and study in the future, so as to contribute to the cause of socialist construction.

	Zhang Zhiyi, Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, was invited to speak at the meeting. Zhang Zhiyi said that the communists believe that in the process of socialist revolution, the majority of bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals can be transformed, but the process of transformation is by no means easy. He congratulated the students on the gains they had made in their studies, and hoped that after studying, everyone would continue to strengthen their political and ideological remolding while serving socialism.

	Representatives from the central committees of various democratic parties attended today's graduation ceremony. Hu Zi'ang, vice chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, spoke on behalf of the democratic parties at the meeting, expressing his heartfelt gratitude to the Communist Party for holding the Socialist Academy to help members of the democratic parties undergo fundamental remolding. He hoped that the students will continue to study and constantly transform themselves in the spirit and attitude they learned in the academy in the future. One of the students introduced his study experience at the meeting at the end.

	After this class of students graduates from the Socialist Academy, the academy leadership plans to summarize the experience of political and ideological remolding, and will immediately begin preparing for the enrollment work of the second class of students.

    走了自我改造的第一步
    社会主义学院第一期学员结业
    据新华社6日讯　由政协全国委员会举办的社会主义学院第一期学员，今天举行结业式。来自各民主党派的学员——他们都是民主党派各级的负责人员，经过两年多的学习，多数人在政治思想改造方面取得了不同程度的收获，他们即将踏上工作岗位，继续为社会主义建设贡献力量。
      社会主义学院，这是一个形式特殊的学校。这里的学员，按照自愿的原则，通过马克思列宁主义的学习以及批评和自我批评的方法，在集中的时间内进行政治思想改造，以改变自己的立场、观点和认识问题的方法。
    社会主义学院从1956年10月开始举办，本期毕业的学员有一百三十多名。社会主义学院院长吴玉章在结业式上讲了话，他说，经过两年多的学习，大部分学员在政治上、思想上有了不同程度的进步，并且其中一部分进步较快较大，有的并且已成为左派，应该说收获是很大的。不过，他说，多数人的政治立场还未脱离中间状态，也有人进步较小，甚至还停留在原来的状况，自然这只是很少数。他说，经过学习，大多数学员在自我认识方面，对自己有了比较正确的看法，承认自己在社会主义革命问题上有两面性，承认自己的资产阶级立场并未完全抛弃，表示愿意接受社会主义改造。许多人已开始能够用阶级观点来分析问题，吴玉章说，这是有了觉悟的表现，是改造自己的第一步。其次，在敌我问题上，大多数学员基本上有了比较深刻的认识，不少人且能够与右派分清界线。再次，大多数学员对于人民内部两条道路的斗争，也提高了识别能力，并且表示愿意站在正确的一面，加强改造，走社会主义道路。吴玉章谈到最后一个收获，就是大多数学员开始习惯了批评和自我批评，认识到批评与自我批评是自我改造的一个极其重要的武器。吴玉章强调说，应该肯定，收获是巨大的，但是这些收获还只是自我改造的第一步。为了进一步加强改造，吴玉章勉励大家，今后要认清形势，提高觉悟，掌握批评和自我批评的武器，继续进行政治思想改造。
    吴玉章最后说，同学们结业后，大多要回到原来的工作岗位，他希望所有的人在今后通过实践，通过学习，继续抓紧改造自己的任务，以便能够为社会主义建设事业贡献力量。
    中共中央统战部副部长张执一应邀在会上讲话。张执一说，共产党人相信，在社会主义革命过程中，资产阶级分子及资产阶级知识分子多数人是可以改造过来的，但是改造的过程绝不是轻而易举的。他祝贺学员们在学习中所取得的收获，并且希望大家经过学习后，在为社会主义服务的同时，继续加强自己的政治思想改造。
    各民主党派中央都派了代表参加今天的结业式。中国民主建国会中央委员会副主任委员胡子昂代表民主党派在会上讲了话，他对于共产党为了帮助民主党派成员进行根本改造而举办社会主义学院，表示衷心感谢。他希望学员们今后本着在学院学习的精神和态度，继续学习，不断改造自己。有一位学员最后在会上介绍了自己的学习心得。
    社会主义学院这一期学员结业以后，学院领导方面准备总结政治思想改造的经验，并即着手筹备第二期学员的招生工作。
