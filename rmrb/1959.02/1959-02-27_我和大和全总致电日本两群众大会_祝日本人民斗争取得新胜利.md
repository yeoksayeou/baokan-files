Xinhua News Agency, February 26th – More than thirty Japanese people's organizations from all walks of life will jointly hold a Japan Peace Congress in Tokyo on the 27th and 28th to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and promote peaceful coexistence.

The China Peace Committee today sent a telegram to the Japan Peace Committee, warmly congratulating the convening of the congress and expressing greetings and respect to the Japanese people who are bravely opposing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and striving for independence, peace, and democracy.

The telegram from the China Peace Committee stated: "The real purpose of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries in revising the 'Security Treaty' is to further incorporate Japan into the U.S. atomic strategic system, turn Japan into a base for the U.S. to launch atomic war, actively arm Japan with nuclear weapons, and firmly tie Japan to the U.S. war chariot, making Japan an accomplice of the U.S. in its aggression against Asian countries. The Kishi Nobusuke government's further military collusion with the United States not only shows its willingness to sell out Japan's national interests but also once again exposes Kishi Nobusuke's true face of hostility towards the Chinese people. If the conspiracy of the U.S. and Japan to revise the 'Security Treaty' succeeds, the Japanese nation will suffer the devastating scourge of atomic war, and it will also seriously threaten peace in Asia and the world. The Japanese people's struggle to abolish the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' and oppose the revival of militarism not only conforms to the vital interests of the Japanese people but is also a significant contribution to peace in Asia and the world.

"The Chinese people have always supported the Japanese people's just struggle for independence, peace, and democracy. We believe that in the struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' revision of the 'Security Treaty,' the Japanese people will further strengthen their unity and achieve new victories."

Xinhua News Agency, February 26th – The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) today sent a telegram to the National Congress for Breaking the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" System and Restoring Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, which will be held in Tokyo on the 28th, expressing sincere congratulations and fraternal support on behalf of the Chinese workers.

The ACFTU's telegram stated:

"The negotiations on revising the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' clearly exposed the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to drag Japan into the road of war and the Kishi government's ambition to revive Japanese militarism and imperialism.

"In order to serve U.S. imperialism, the Kishi government has consistently adopted a blatant attitude of hostility towards the Chinese people, preventing the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan to this day. To alleviate the increasingly serious dissatisfaction among all strata of Japanese society, Kishi Nobusuke's recent gestures regarding Sino-Japanese relations are merely a conspiracy to shift the responsibility for the failure to improve Sino-Japanese relations to the Chinese side. Kishi Nobusuke's reactionary policies and double-dealing tactics have been seen through by the broad masses of the Japanese people and have been met with strong protests and opposition. The convening of your congress is a powerful response to this policy.

"We firmly believe that Kishi Nobusuke's continued implementation of this reactionary policy will only provoke increasingly fierce opposition from the Japanese people, the Chinese people, and all the people of Asia and Africa, and he will reap the consequences.

"Chinese workers resolutely support your just struggle and wish you greater success in your struggle."

    我和大和全总致电日本两群众大会
    祝日本人民斗争取得新胜利
    新华社26日讯　日本各界三十多个人民团体27、28两日将在东京联合举行废除日美“安全条约”、促进和平共处日本和平大会。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会今天致电日本和平委员会，热烈祝贺大会的召开，并对英勇地反对日美“安全条约”，争取独立、和平、民主的日本人民表示问候和敬意。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的电报说：“美日反动派修订‘安全条约’的真正目的在于进一步把日本纳入美国原子战略体系，把日本变成美国发动原子战争的基地，积极用核武器武装日本，把日本牢牢地绑在美国的战车上，使日本成为美国侵略亚洲国家的帮凶。岸信介政府进一步同美国实行新的军事勾结，不仅说明它心甘情愿地出卖日本的民族利益，而且再一次暴露了岸信介敌视中国人民的真面目。如果美日修订‘安全条约’的阴谋得逞，日本民族将会遭受原子战争毁灭性的祸害，而且也将严重威胁亚洲和世界的和平。日本人民要求废除日美‘安全条约’、反对复活军国主义的斗争，不仅符合日本人民切身利益，也是对亚洲和世界和平的重大贡献。
    “中国人民一向支持日本人民要求独立、和平、民主的正义斗争，我们相信，在反对美日反动派修订‘安全条约’的斗争中，日本人民将进一步加强团结和取得新的胜利。”
    新华社26日讯　中华全国总工会今天致电28日将在东京举行的日本打破日美“安全条约”体系，恢复日中邦交国民大会，代表中国工人对大会表示衷心的祝贺和兄弟般的支持。
    中华全国总工会的电报说：
    “修改日美‘安全条约’的谈判，明显地暴露了美帝国主义把日本拖入战争道路的阴谋和岸政府企图复活日本军国主义和帝国主义的野心。
    “为了向美帝国主义效劳，岸政府对中国人民一贯采取露骨的敌视态度，使中日两国迄未恢复正常关系。为了缓和日本各阶层日益严重的不满，岸信介最近在中日关系上作出的种种姿态，只不过是准备把中日关系不得改善的责任推到中国方面的一种阴谋。岸信介这种反动政策和两面手法，已为日本广大人民所识破，并遭到强烈的抗议和反对。贵大会的召开，正是对这种政策的一个有力的回答。
    “我们深信，岸信介继续执行这种反动政策，只会更激起日本人民、中国人民和全亚非人民越来越激烈的反对，而自食其果。
    “中国工人坚决支持你们的正义斗争，并祝你们在斗争中获得更大的成就。”
