    Act Early to Prevent Spring Drought
    By People's Daily Commentator

    This year, most regions have experienced sparse rain and snow; meteorological science departments predict that many regions may continue to lack rain in the coming period. This situation adds an important item to the current main combat tasks on our agricultural front—the management of summer harvest crops and the preparation for spring plowing: drought prevention and soil moisture conservation. Soil must have sufficient fertilizer for crop growth, and also adequate moisture, for various crops to grow well. Therefore, while vigorously engaging in accumulating fertilizer, making fertilizer, topdressing, and preparing improved seeds, farm tools, and draft animals, all localities must also allocate a certain amount of manpower to effectively strengthen drought prevention work.

    Drought prevention is an urgent and arduous task. Spring irrigation, water storage, harrowing to conserve soil moisture, and other drought prevention measures are all agricultural tasks with strong time constraints; slight relaxation will lead to missed opportunities. Building farmland water conservancy projects, repairing and supplementing water lifting tools, leveling irrigation land, etc., may not be ready in time if started late. Generally speaking, most areas are only about a month away from spring plowing. During the days of spring sowing, "a day can delay an entire spring"; a difference of half a day in sowing time will make a big difference in the growth of crops. Delaying drought prevention work will affect timely sowing; it will also greatly affect the returning green growth of wheat seedlings.

    Since it is called "drought prevention," it means preventing problems before they occur, that is to say, drought has not yet formed when this work is being done. Under such circumstances, some people often have a fluke mentality of waiting for rain, believing that: how can it not rain for a long time? Of course, it will always rain, it will not never rain; however, it will never come early because people are looking forward to it, let alone happen to fall to suit the needs of sowing.

    It is absolutely impossible to regard the current situation as static and unchanging. Under current conditions, we are still unable to grasp the laws of occurrence and development of this natural phenomenon with 100% certainty. This requires us to envision the most serious situation and make full preparations, instead of harboring any侥幸之心 (fluke mentality). Of course, the existing soil moisture and water sources are all worth valuing; however, we cannot become complacent just because we have these. When the drought develops to a certain extent, the soil moisture in the ground will deteriorate rapidly, and the water in rivers and wells will also change from abundance to scarcity, and even depletion. When water is needed for drought resistance, there is no water in the wells. What counts as doing a good job in drought prevention? The standard can only be this: ensure that even in the most drought-stricken times, there is soil moisture in the ground for sowing, and there is water in rivers and wells for irrigation. This requires attention to improving quality and paying attention to practical results from the very beginning of drought prevention work.

    Drought prevention is not an unfamiliar thing for many regions. However, this year there are also new favorable conditions. We must fully use the rich experience accumulated in the past to deal with it; and pay attention to adapting to the situation of communization, fully use the favorable conditions of communization to better organize labor to deal with natural disasters; adapt to the situation of deep plowing and close planting, and also find new experiences in drought prevention and soil moisture conservation and drought resistance. Whether from an organizational, material, or experiential point of view, our strength is greater than in the past. Overcoming the spring drought that may occur this year is to clear obstacles for the great advance of 1050 billion catties of grain, 100 million dan of ginned cotton, and more oil crops, hemp, etc.

    及早动手，预防春旱 
    本报评论员
    今年多数地区雨雪稀少；气象科学部门预报，今后一个时期许多地区仍然可能缺雨。这个情况给我们农业战线上当前的主要战斗任务——夏收作物的管理工作和春耕准备工作，增加了一个重要的项目，就是防旱保墒。土壤里有足够作物生长的肥料，还要有适当的水分，各种作物才能很好地生长。因此，各地在大搞积肥、制肥、追肥和准备良种、农具和耕畜的时候，还必须拿出一定的力量来切实加强防旱工作。
    防旱是紧迫而繁重的任务。春灌、蓄水、耙地保墒等防旱措施，都是有强烈时间性的农活，稍为放松就会失掉时机。兴修农田水利、检修和补充提水工具、平整灌溉土地等，动手晚了就可能赶不上使用。就多数地区说，目前距春耕只有一个月左右。在春播的日子里，“一天能误一个春”，播种时间差一天半天，庄稼生长的好坏就会大不相同。如果推迟了防旱工作，就会影响到适时下种；对麦苗的返青生长，也会大有影响。
    既然说是“防旱”，就是防患于未然，也就是说，在做这个工作的时候旱象还没有形成。有些人在这种情况下往往有一种等待下雨的侥幸心理，他们认为：哪能长时间不下雨呢？当然，雨总是要下的，不会永远不下雨；但是，它决不会因为人们的翘首盼望而提前，更不会恰巧下得适合播种的需要。
    决不可把当前的情况看作静止的不变的。在目前的条件下，我们还不可能百分之百地掌握这种自然现象的发生和发展规律。这就要求我们必须设想到最严重的情况，作充分的准备，而不可稍存侥幸之心。对于现有的墒情和水源，当然都是值得重视的；但是不能因为有了这些就认为可以有恃无恐了。在干旱发展到一定程度的时候，地里的墒情会急转直下，河水、井水也会由多变少，甚至枯竭。在抗旱需水的时候，井里反而没有水了。怎样才算做好了防旱工作？标准只能是这样的：保证在最干旱的时候，地里有墒可以下种，河里、井里有水可供灌溉。这就要求在一开始进行防旱工作的时候就注意提高质量，注意实效。
    防旱对许多地区说并不是什么生疏的事情。但是，今年也有新的有利的条件。我们要充分运用过去积累起来的丰富经验来对付它；并且注意适应公社化的情况，充分运用公社化的有利条件更好地组织劳动力对付自然灾害；适应深耕密植的情况，也要找出防旱保墒和抗旱的新经验。无论从组织上、物质上、经验上来说，我们的力量都比过去更强大了。战胜今年可能发生的春旱，就是为一万零五百亿斤粮食、一亿担皮棉和更多的油料、麻等等的大进军扫除障碍。
