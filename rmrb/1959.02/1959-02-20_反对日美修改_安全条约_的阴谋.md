Oppose the Conspiracy to Revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"
　　President of the Japan Peace Committee, Hirano Yoshitaro

　　Attempt to Revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"

　　To create world peace, China's Second Five-Year Plan and the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan are both being implemented. Their success is a guarantee of world peace. However, the Japanese government of Nobusuke Kishi, which follows the United States in pursuing a war policy, intends to import nuclear weapons from the United States through the so-called "Defense Six-Year Plan" (1958-1964) and step up preparations to equip the Self-Defense Forces with nuclear weapons.
　　Japan's nuclear armament plan and Foreign Minister Fujiyama's eagerness to sign a revised Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" with the United States are two sides of the same coin. Once the revised Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is signed and approved by the Diet, Japan's nuclear armament will be carried out openly and legally, thereby laying the foundation for the formation of a Northeast Asian military aggression group hostile to the people of Asian countries. This is the concrete content of what Nobusuke Kishi calls the "New Era of Japan-U.S. Relations." The Japanese peace movement is fighting head-on to oppose the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."
　　The attempt by the Japanese and U.S. reactionaries to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is to incorporate Japan into the U.S. atomic strategy system, reorganize Japan's military with nuclear armament as the center, and turn the Japanese Self-Defense Forces into mercenaries of the United States. Because Japan's military reorganization centered on nuclear armament is closely combined with the U.S. atomic war preparations, Japan will assist U.S. imperialism in launching military aggression against China and other countries and assume aggressive obligations. At the same time, Japanese monopoly capital also wants to take this opportunity to expand overseas, develop the military industry, suppress the growing political consciousness of the working class, and accelerate the revival of militarism. U.S. President Eisenhower's State of the Union Address focuses on promoting a key missile development program in the military field, planning to allocate $6.7 billion for missile development. The Japanese government of Nobusuke Kishi is also compiling the "Defense Agency's" budget with a key missile development program.
　　The total budget of the Japanese "Defense Agency" for fiscal year 1959 is 136.04 billion yen, an increase of 15.98 billion yen compared to fiscal year 1958. Adding the expenses of the U.S. military advisory group stationed in Japan and the defense burden-sharing expenses, the total budgetary expenditure in "defense" amounts to 153.665 billion yen, accounting for 10.8% of Japan's entire national budget for fiscal year 1959. Among them, in terms of strengthening nuclear weapons equipment, it is worth noting that the expenditure item for the missile test force appeared for the first time in the draft budget of the "Defense Agency." The "Defense Agency" will do its best to develop missile weapons such as ground-to-air missiles, mainly "Oerlikon" missiles, and it is expected to trial-produce anti-tank missiles for actual combat in 1959 and ground-to-air missiles and air-to-air missiles in 1960. In fiscal year 1959, it also plans to purchase various types of missiles from the United States and Switzerland to accelerate nuclear armament.
　　From this, it can be seen that the Japanese government's publicity that the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is to achieve a "bilateral" and "equal" "revision" is a deception, and it is trying to use this guise to perpetuate the military bases established by the United States in Japan and Okinawa and openly make Japan an atomic war base for the United States to launch aggression in the Far East.

　　Okinawa and the so-called "Joint Defense Area"
　　In revising the "Security Treaty," both Japan and the United States are trying to include Okinawa in the "joint defense area," either explicitly or implicitly. The United States has already transported nuclear weapons and missiles into Okinawa. The Okinawa base has become the largest center of the U.S. atomic strategic system in the Far East.
　　Currently, the U.S. military stationed in Okinawa is approximately 50,000, mainly the Marine Corps. The United States has built medium-range ballistic missiles with a range of 2,400 kilometers in Henoko and Gushikami. The U.S. atomic base in Okinawa is not only aimed at China, but also used to suppress Japan if it takes action to resist the United States. The "Nike Hercules" missile (range of 110 kilometers) bases established by the United States in Yontan, Chinen, and Kitatani have already transported atomic weapons and are stationed with Nike missile units. The U.S. Fifth Strategic Air Force stationed in Kadena (with various types of aircraft such as B66, B47, and B57) patrols between bases in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. The U.S. Department of Defense will allocate $6.28 million in the 1959 budget to strengthen the construction of the Okinawa base, which is twice as much as in 1958.
　　Including Okinawa in the "joint defense area" is one of the important goals of the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The so-called "joint defense" means recognizing that Okinawa is entirely U.S. territory, and the Japanese Self-Defense Forces are responsible for participating in the U.S. aggressive wars launched in the Far East with Okinawa as a base. The United States has been attempting to plot the "two Chinas" conspiracy by occupying Taiwan. The Japanese reactionaries also want to use Okinawa as a base to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan by force and to dispatch Japanese troops to Kinmen, Matsu, and any other area in the Western Pacific. Moreover, after training in landing operations and airborne troop operations, the Japanese army will become the vanguard and act as cannon fodder for the United States to launch aggressive wars in the Far East. Japan will shoulder the burden of the U.S. strategic plan.

　　Japan will shoulder the burden of the U.S. strategic plan
　　Currently, the U.S. military stationed in Japan has approximately 45,000 personnel from the Fifth Tactical Air Force (headquarters in Fuchu), commanded by the U.S. Pacific Forces Commander (unified command in Hawaii), approximately 13,000 personnel from the U.S. Far East Naval Detachment, and approximately 17,000 personnel from the Army responsible for military engineering and communications. In addition, the U.S. Seventh Fleet uses Japanese ports such as Yokosuka, Kure, and Sasebo as bases, and the U.S. Third Marine Division, approximately 50,000 personnel, is stationed in Okinawa. The U.S. First Naval Air Wing stationed in Atsugi and Iwakuni possesses small nuclear weapons. The incident of this air wing going to the Taiwan Strait in the autumn of 1958 is still fresh in people's memory.
　　The U.S. 39th Air Division is stationed in Misawa in northern Honshu, Japan, possessing aircraft with nuclear attack capabilities such as the F100. The 41st Air Division stationed in Irumagawa (Saitama Prefecture) near Tokyo possesses military aircraft carrying atomic bombs such as B57, B86D, and F100. The bomber squadron stationed in Yokome possesses aircraft such as the D57. In particular, the Kanto region behind Tokyo is the center of this atomic bombing base, which makes Tokyo, with a population of 9 million, in terrible danger of being retaliated against with nuclear weapons.
　　These main U.S. military bases can constitute the deployment of aggressive troops in terms of guidance relations based on the joint combat relationship between the U.S. military and the Japanese Self-Defense Forces. For example, the U.S. Fifth Air Force Command at the Fuchu base is together with the Japan Self-Defense Forces Air General Command. As the equipment of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces is strengthened, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces will shoulder a burden of the U.S. strategic plan and be driven by the U.S. military, which is the essence of the so-called "joint operations."

　　Resolutely follow the path of peace and neutrality
　　From the above, it can be seen that the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has a blatant reactionary attempt. So, why do both Japan and the United States want to forcibly revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," especially now?
　　The current world is a world where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. The struggle for national independence in colonies and dependent countries is surging, and the broad masses of people in the capitalist world are standing up to fight for peace, democracy, and improving their living standards. Moreover, the economic crisis in the capitalist world is also deepening day by day. Faced with this world situation, the United States is attempting to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to intensify its reactionary military and economic policies in Asia, reorganize and strengthen its aggressive system, and counter this world trend.
　　In a word, the current world situation will rapidly develop in a direction more favorable to socialism and unfavorable to capitalism and U.S. imperialism. This is the main reason why the Japanese and U.S. monopoly capital groups are eager to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." It is very obvious that they want to take advantage of the current opportunity to strengthen their rule and forcibly promote war policies. Therefore, the Japanese government's activities in revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" with the U.S. government are anti-people and anti-national in nature, which is very obvious.
　　The Japanese people are fighting to oppose the revision of this "treaty" and strive for the abolition of this "treaty." This struggle of the people throughout Japan is carried out with the support of the widespread struggle for peace waged by the people all over the world. The broad masses of the Japanese people have joined the struggle for peace, democracy, and improving their living standards. The victorious progress of this struggle will create favorable conditions for fundamentally shaking the rule of Japanese monopoly capital, crushing the ambition of U.S. monopoly capital to dominate Asia and the world, and strengthening the struggle of the Japanese and Asian peoples for national independence. In particular, this struggle will make it possible for the Japanese nation to return to the friendly family of Asian nations. This is a huge force for further strengthening the friendly unity between the Japanese and Chinese nations, as well as strengthening the friendly unity of Asian nations. The broad masses of the Japanese people hope to abandon any war, not participate in any military alliances, and hope that all nations live in peace. The struggle to oppose the revision and strive for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is an important step in realizing this urgent desire of the Japanese people.
　　The statement issued by Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi on the issue of revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the relevant statement of the Soviet government have increased the Japanese people's courage and confidence in the struggle for peace. At a time when the Nobusuke Kishi government is stepping up negotiations with the United States to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the Japan Peace Congress to be held in Tokyo on February 27 and 28 will become a major turning point for Japan's leap forward on the road of peace and neutrality and for strengthening the struggle to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

    反对日美修改“安全条约”的阴谋
    日本和平委员会理事长　平野义太郎
    日美修改“安全条约”的企图
    为了缔造世界和平，中国的第二个五年计划和苏联的七年计划，都在开始执行中。它们的成功是世界和平的保障。然而，追随美国推行战争政策的日本岸信介政府，则以所谓“防卫六年计划”（1958—1964年）想从美国运进核武器，加紧准备以核武器装备自卫队。
    日本的核武装计划，和日本外相藤山急于同美国签订修改后的日美“安全条约”的办法，是表里一体的。一旦修改后的日美“安全条约”得以签订并在国会上获得批准，那末日本的核武装就会以公然合法的面目进行，从而为组成以亚洲各国人民为敌的东北亚军事侵略集团打下基础。这就是岸信介所说的“日美新时代”的具体内容。日本的和平运动正在针锋相对地为反对修改日美“安全条约”而斗争。
    日美反动派修改日美“安全条约”的企图，是要把日本纳入美国的原子战略体系，以核武装为中心重整日本的军备，使日本自卫队变成美国的雇佣兵。由于日本以核武装为中心的重整军备同美国的原子备战密切结合，日本将协助美帝国主义对中国等国家发动军事侵略，并承担侵略义务，同时日本垄断资本还想借此向海外实行扩张，发展军需工业，镇压政治觉悟不断增长的工人阶级，加紧复活军国主义。美国总统艾森豪威尔的新年咨文在军事方面是要推行发展导弹的重点计划，计划拨出六十七亿美元供发展导弹之用。日本的岸信介政府也以发展导弹的重点计划来编制“防卫厅”的预算。
    1959年度日本“防卫厅”的预算总计一千三百六十亿四千万日元，比1958年度增加一百五十九亿八千万日元。加上驻日美军顾问团经费、防卫分担费，那末在“防卫”方面的预算开支总额达一千五百三十六亿六千五百万日元，占日本1959年度整个国家预算的10.8％。其中在加强核武器装备方面，值得注意的是在“防卫厅”的预算草案中第一次出现了导弹试验部队的开支项目。“防卫厅”将以“厄利康”式导弹为主尽力发展地对空导弹等导弹武器，预计在1959年试制实战用的反坦克导弹，1960年试制地对空导弹和空对空导弹。1959年度还准备从美国、瑞士购入各种类型的导弹，加紧推行核武装。
    由此可见，日本政府宣传修改日美“安全条约”是为了实现“双边”和“平等”的“改订”，这是一个骗局，是想在这种幌子下使美国在日本本土及冲绳建立的军事基地永久化，并公然使日本成为美国在远东发动侵略的原子战争基地。
    冲绳和所谓“共同防卫地区”
    日美双方在修改“安全条约”中，或明或暗地想把冲绳列入“共同防卫地区”。美国已经把核武器和导弹运进冲绳。冲绳基地成了美国在远东的原子战略体制的最大中心。
    现在，美国在冲绳的驻军大约有五万人，主力是海军陆战队。美国在边野古、具志头修了射程二千四百公里的中程弹道导弹。美国在冲绳的原子基地，不仅是针对中国，而且一旦日本发生反抗美国的行动，也会用它来压制日本。美国在读谷、知念、北谷设立的“奈克·赫尔克里士”式导弹（射程一百一十公里）基地，已经运进了原子武器，并驻有奈克导弹部队。驻在嘉手纳的美国第五战略空军（有B66、B47、B57各种类型飞机），在日本、台湾、南朝鲜等的基地之间往返巡逻。美国国防部在1959年度预算中将拨出六百二十八万美元来加强冲绳基地的建设，这笔款子比1958年度多一倍。
    把冲绳列入“共同防卫地区”是日美修改“安全条约”的重要目标之一。所谓“共同防卫”，就是既承认冲绳完全是美国的领土，而日本的自卫队又负有参加美国以冲绳为据点在远东发动的侵略战争。美国一直企图以霸占台湾的行动来策划制造“两个中国”的阴谋，日本反动派也想以冲绳为据点用武力阻止中国人民解放台湾，以及向金门、马祖及西太平洋其它任何地区派遣日本军队。而且日本军队经过登陆作战和伞兵部队作战的训练后，将成为第一线的尖兵，给美国打头阵，充当美国在远东发动侵略战争的炮灰。日本将肩起美国战略计划担子
    目前驻在日本本土的美军有美国驻太平洋部队司令（统一司令部设在夏威夷）指挥下的第五战术空军部队（司令部设在府中）约四万五千人，有美国远东海军分遣队约一万三千人左右，还有担任军事工程及通信联络的陆军约一万七千人。此外，美国的第七舰队以日本的横须贺、吴、佐世保等军港为基地，在冲绳还驻有美国第三海军陆战队师大约五万人。驻在厚木、岩国的美国第一海军航空队拥有小型核武器。1958年秋天这支航空队开赴台湾海峡的事情至今世人记忆犹新。
    日本本州北部的三泽驻有美国第三十九航空师，拥有F100等有原子攻击能力的飞机。驻在东京附近的入间川（琦玉县）的第四十一航空师，拥有B57、B86D、F100等载原子弹的军用机。驻在横目的轰炸连，拥有D57等类型的飞机。尤其是东京背后的关东地方，是这种原子轰炸基地的中心，这使拥有九百万人口的东京，有遭到核武器报复打击的可怕危险。
    以上这些主要的美军基地，都可以根据美军和日本自卫队共同作战关系，而在指导关系上构成侵略军队的部署。例如，府中基地的美国第五航空军司令部就是和日本自卫队航空总队司令部在一起的。随着日本自卫队装备的加强，日本自卫队将肩负起美国战略计划的一副担子，而受美军驱使，这就是所谓“共同作战”的实质。
    坚决走和平中立的道路
    从上述看来，日美修改“安全条约”具有露骨的反动企图。那末，为什么日美双方要强行修改日美“安全条约”，尤其是现在急于这样做呢？
    现在的世界是东风压倒西风的世界，殖民地、附属国争取民族独立的斗争风起云涌，资本主义世界的广大人民在挺身为争取和平、民主和提高生活水平而斗争。而且资本主义世界的经济危机也在一天天地加深。面对着这种世界局势，美国企图通过日美“安全条约”的修改，加紧推行它在亚洲的反动的军事和经济政策，重新改组和加强它的侵略体制，以对抗这种世界潮流。
    一句话，现在世界局势更将迅速地朝着有利于社会主义，而不利于资本主义和美帝国主义的方向发展。这就是日美垄断资本集团急于修改日美“安全条约”的最主要的原因所在。十分明显，它们想趁着现在的时机加强自己的统治和强制推行战争政策。因此，日本政府同美国政府修改日美“安全条约”的活动，具有反人民的、反民族的性质，是十分明显的。
    日本人民正在为反对修改这个“条约”和争取废除这个“条约”而斗争。日本全国人民的这一斗争，是在全世界人民广泛开展的争取和平斗争的支持下进行的。日本的广大人民群众投入了争取和平、民主和提高生活水平的斗争。这一斗争的胜利进展，将为从根本上动摇日本垄断资本的统治、粉碎美国垄断资本独霸亚洲和世界的野心，以及加强日本及亚洲人民争取民族独立的斗争，创造有利的条件。尤其是这一斗争将会使日本民族重返亚洲各民族友好大家庭的怀抱成为可能。这是进一步加强日本民族同中国民族的友好团结，以及加强亚洲各民族友好团结的巨大力量。日本的广大人民都希望放弃任何的战争，不参加任何的军事同盟，而且希望各民族和平相处。为反对修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”的斗争，是实现日本人民这一迫切愿望的重要步骤。
    中国陈毅副总理兼外交部长就日美修改“安全条约”问题发表的声明和苏联政府的有关声明，给日本人民增加了争取和平斗争的勇气和信心。在岸信介政府加紧同美国谈判修改日美“安全条约”的时候，2月27日和28日将在东京召开的日本和平大会，将会成为日本在和平中立的道路上跃进和加强争取废除日美“安全条约”斗争的重大转折点。
