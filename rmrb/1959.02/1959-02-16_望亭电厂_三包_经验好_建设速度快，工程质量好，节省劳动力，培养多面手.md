    Wangting Power Plant's "Three Guarantees" Experience is Good
    Fast Construction Speed, Good Project Quality, Labor Saving, and Cultivation of Versatile Workers
    (Our Newspaper) News from Jiangsu: The Wangting Power Plant in Jiangsu Province, in the recent installation of a 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator, broke with convention and boldly adopted the "Three Guarantees" method (operation guarantees maintenance, maintenance guarantees installation, installation guarantees operation), greatly saving labor, improving installation quality, and accelerating construction speed, enabling the power station to generate electricity and go into production ahead of schedule.
    According to past practice, power plants typically have separate teams for operation, maintenance, and installation, each responsible for their own specialty. However, in reality, maintenance workers generally also understand installation, and operation workers can also handle machine maintenance. Based on this situation, after the completion of the first phase of the new construction project at the Wangting Power Plant, the plant leadership proposed using the "Three Guarantees" method for the second phase of the expansion project. The installation and maintenance team, in addition to one-third of the civil engineering and installation personnel from the Shanghai Construction Engineering Bureau No. 24 who were responsible for the first phase of the project, was mainly composed of the plant's maintenance personnel and 450 new apprentices. This team was responsible for all installation tasks for the second phase of the project. In this way, the No. 24 Engineering Bureau was able to free up two-thirds of its strength to carry out new construction and expansion projects at other power plants.
    The newly formed installation and maintenance team at Wangting Power Plant, at the beginning of 1959, installed the first 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator in the second phase of the project in just two days and three nights. Because the maintenance personnel participated in the installation work, they paid special attention to the installation quality. After the three-day installation was completed, they spent a full four days conducting careful inspections and tests to ensure that the installation quality met the national standards. This installation and maintenance team will not only be responsible for the installation of four 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generators and three 120-ton boilers this year, but also for the major repair and improvement projects of the plant's original six units and seven 75-ton boilers. One team is being used as two, fully leveraging human potential.
    After the maintenance team took on the installation tasks, the daily machine maintenance and upkeep was taken over by the operation workers, except for necessary regular overhauls and improvement projects. Under the premise of ensuring safe and economical operation, the operation personnel also actively explored the potential of the equipment and increased the generator output. Currently, the output of each of the plant's four 22,000-kilowatt generators has been increased to 24,000 kilowatts, and the output of each of the two 6,000-kilowatt generators has also been increased to 7,200 kilowatts. Thanks to the operation workers' careful maintenance and upkeep, the machines are still operating normally.
    In the process of installation, the maintenance team also trained a large number of new apprentices. For example, more than 70 young apprentices learning electric welding were able to master the technology within one or two months, and more than a dozen of them were able to complete tasks independently. Some apprentices who had only been in the plant for three months had already participated in two installation projects and made rapid progress in their skills. After the completion of the second phase of the installation work, these young workers can be transferred to take over the work of the operation workers, and because they installed the machines themselves, they are very familiar with them and can carry out maintenance at any time. The current operation workers can then be transferred to participate in installation work.
    Through the practical exercise of implementing the "Three Guarantees" in the second phase of the installation project, the workers at the Wangting Power Plant will gradually become versatile, able to produce, maintain, and install. This will not only accelerate the plant's capital construction speed, but also train technical workers in batches to support other plants.

### 望亭电厂“三包”经验好  建设速度快，工程质量好，节省劳动力，培养多面手

    望亭电厂“三包”经验好  
    建设速度快，工程质量好，节省劳动力，培养多面手
    本报讯　江苏省望亭发电厂在最近安装二万五千瓩汽轮发电机过程中，打破惯例，大胆采用三包（运行包检修，检修包安装，安装包运行）办法，大大节省了劳动力，提高了安装质量，加快了建设速度，使电站得以提前发电，投入生产。
    按照过去一般的习惯，电厂中的运行、检修和安装，各有一套人马，各管专业。但是在实际上，负责检修的工人，一般也懂得安装，负责运行的也可以兼任机器的维护工作。根据这种情况，望亭电厂在第一期新建工程结束后，厂领导上就提出要用“三包”办法，进行第二期扩建工程。安装检修队伍除由原来负责一期工程的上海基建局二十四工程处留下三分之一的土建和安装人员外，主要由厂内的检修人员和四百五十名新学工组成。这支队伍担负第二期工程的全部安装任务。这样，二十四工程处便能腾出三分之二的力量，进行其他电厂的新建和扩建工程。
    望亭电厂新组织成的这支安装检修队，在1959年开初，就以三天二夜的速度，安装好了二期工程中的第一部二万五千瓩汽轮发电机。由于检修人员参加了安装工作，对安装质量特别重视，在三天安装完毕后，整整用四天的时间进行精细的检查和试验，使安装质量达到了国家要求的标准。这个安装检修队今年不仅要担负四台二万五千瓩汽轮发电机和三台一百二十吨锅炉的安装任务，同时还担负了厂里原有六台机组和七台七十五吨锅炉的大修改进工程的工作。一套班子，当两套使用，充分地发挥了人的潜力。
    检修队负担安装任务后，除必要的定期的大修和改进工程由他们负责外，日常的机器维护和保养工作就由运行工人负责。运行人员在保证安全经济运行的前提下，还积极地挖掘设备潜力，提高发电机的出力。目前全厂四部二万二千瓩的发电机，每部出力已增加到二万四千瓩，两部六千瓩的发电机，每部出力也增加到七千二百瓩，由于运行工人的加意维护和保养，机器运转仍很正常。
    检修队在安装的过程中，同时培养了大批的新学工。如学习电焊的七十多个青年学工，在一两个月内，已经能掌握技术，有十多个人已能单独地完成任务。有些刚进厂不过三个月的学工，已经参加了两次安装工程，技术进步很快。这些青年工人，在第二期安装工作完成后，就可以调出来负担运行工人的工作，而且因为机器是他们自己安装的，他们很熟悉，也可以随时进行检修。而现在的运行工人又可以调出去参加安装工作。
    通过第二期安装工程中实行“三包”的实际锻炼，望亭电厂的工人都将逐渐成为多面手，既会生产，又会检修，又会安装，这不但加快了本厂的基建速度，而且可以成批地培养技术工人支援外厂。
