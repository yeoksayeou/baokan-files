Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 4th. The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued its meeting in the Grand Kremlin Palace at 4:00 PM (Moscow time) on the 4th to discuss Comrade Khrushchev's report.

    The first to speak was Denisov, First Secretary of the Saratov Oblast Committee of the CPSU. He said that the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan will make the Soviet state even richer and stronger. Now, there is no region on the map of the Soviet Union that does not have a provision for the development of productive forces or the establishment of new enterprises. The speaker emphasized that in the Soviet state, the law of planned and proportionate economic development is playing a role.

    Speaking of the development prospects of the Saratov Oblast, Denisov said that by 1965, the chemical industry products in the state would increase seventeenfold compared to 1958.

    In his speech, Denisov talked about the speeches of Biryuzin and Saburov at the Congress, in which they examined their own mistakes. He said that Biryuzin's speech was not satisfactory to him because it was not sincere and honest enough.

    Fedorov, Chairman of the State Chemistry Committee of the USSR Council of Ministers, said in his speech that the Seven-Year Plan stipulates a substantial increase in the products of the chemical industry. He cited figures for increasing the production of chemical products, and emphasized that the resolution on accelerating the development of the chemical industry, adopted on the initiative of the Party Central Committee, shows that we must establish polymer chemistry as soon as possible to meet the needs of the national economy and improve the welfare of the people.

    Fedorov said that the capacity to produce synthetic materials is particularly large in oil processing enterprises and regions with large natural gas reserves, such as the Bashkir Autonomous Republic, the Kursk Oblast and Saratov Oblast of the Russian Federation, the Lugansk Oblast and Stanislav Oblast of Ukraine, and Azerbaijan. In the next seven years, these regions will become the leading areas for the comprehensive utilization of oil and gas, and will produce large amounts of synthetic materials.

    In this regard, Fedorov emphasized that organizing the production of synthetic materials in oil refineries can be achieved without large investments. He pointed out that the task put forward by the Party to accelerate the development of the chemical industry will certainly be completed ahead of schedule.

    The next speaker was Academician Yudin, the Soviet Ambassador to China. In his speech, he spoke in detail about the theoretical issues raised in Comrade Khrushchev's report. Yudin said that the Seven-Year Plan is not an individual formula for the transition to communism, but a rigorous scientific plan for the transition to communism. Now, anyone who wants to understand what communism is should study the documents of the 21st Congress of the CPSU in addition to the Marxist classics.

    Yudin continued by saying that, due to his work, he had personally witnessed the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, unswervingly building historically significant revolutionary achievements. He said that China is fully unfolding the construction of a socialist society. It has already advanced a whole era compared to other Asian countries that were at the same level with it not long ago.

    Yudin also spoke in detail about the growth of Chinese industry, the achievements of China in training skilled experts and cadres, and the achievements made by Chinese farmers.

    Yudin emphasized that the Chinese Communist Party is a glorious contingent of the international communist movement. The Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party have won the deep love of the Soviet people and all mankind with their achievements. He said that the whole world is cheering for China's achievements, and only the imperialists and incorrigible revisionists are unhappy.

    Yudin pointed out that Yugoslav revisionists, with the help of American monopoly capital, are promoting the American way of life. American imperialists know the value of the dollar. Yugoslavia has already come under the economic control of the United States.

    Referring to Tito's attacks on the People's Republic of China alongside Dulles, Yudin said that the Tito group is acting together with American imperialists, which exposes the disguise of the revisionists. Krotov, director of the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant, pointed out in his speech that the outline of the Seven-Year Plan inspires the creative enthusiasm of the workers, engineers, and designers of their factory. He said that according to the suggestions they put forward, a plan is being drafted to increase the production capacity of the Soviet Union's largest Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant by 50%, while reducing the previously planned basic investment by half. In his speech, Krotov also expressed his support for the proposal made at the Congress to establish a scientific research institute at the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant. Shkolnikov, First Secretary of the Voronezh Oblast Committee (Russian Federation) of the CPSU, spoke about the industrial development tasks of the Voronezh Oblast, the production enthusiasm of the working people, and the possibility of completing the Seven-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule in the industrial field. Satpayev, President of the Academy of Sciences of the Kazakh Republic, spoke about Kazakhstan's great achievements and abundant underground resources. He said that Kazakhstan has explored more than two hundred coal production areas and more than one thousand oil and gas structures. According to the proven iron ore reserves, Kazakhstan ranks among the top in the Soviet Union. The Republic has a large amount of manganese ore. The copper content of the Jezkazgan copper mine is almost twice as high as that of the best copper mines in the United States. Satpayev pointed out that it can be said that there is not a single element in Mendeleev's periodic table that Kazakhstan does not have. The speaker said that due to the utilization of Kazakhstan's natural resources, Kazakhstan has become a developed industrial and agricultural republic of the Soviet Union since the establishment of Soviet power. In the afternoon meeting, representatives of the fraternal parties of Israel, Bolivia, Switzerland, Iceland, and New Zealand delivered congratulatory messages to the Congress, which were warmly welcomed by the participants.

    The Congress will continue to meet at 10:00 AM tomorrow.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 5th. The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued its meeting at 10:00 AM (Moscow time) today and concluded the discussion on Khrushchev's report.

    The first speaker at the meeting was Peter Shelest, Secretary of the Kiev Oblast Committee of the CPSU. He said that the working people of the Kiev Oblast have achieved important successes since they began implementing the 1959 plan. In the next seven years, almost 65% of the increase in the output of enterprises in the Kiev Oblast will be achieved by increasing labor productivity. To this end, Shelest raised the issue of more widespread adoption of new advanced technologies and mechanization and automation in various industrial sectors, as this will guarantee the solution of the above-mentioned tasks.

    Kolushinsky, Secretary of the Omsk Oblast Committee of the CPSU, said in his speech that compared with 1953, the income of collective farms in the Omsk Oblast has increased by two and a half times in 1958, so it is possible to start a wide range of reconstruction of the countryside and improve rural facilities. When talking about the agricultural development prospects of the Omsk Oblast, Kolushinsky pointed out that the collective farmers of this Oblast guaranteed to complete the meat production plan stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, and to complete the grain production plan stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan in three or four years.

    Academician Kan. Ostrovitianov, Vice President of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, analyzed in his speech a series of theoretical issues raised by Khrushchev in his report regarding the period of comprehensive construction of a communist society in the Soviet Union. He said that the construction of communism puts huge tasks on the social sciences. The task of economics is to be able to solve the problems in the construction of communism. Therefore, the leadership of academic work must be raised to a higher level. Academician Ostrovitianov advocated that the Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union should establish close ties with the State Planning Committee of the Soviet Union, the National Economic Committees and other national economic organs. He said that economists must base their research work on the tasks put forward by the practice of communist construction.

    Borisov, First Secretary of the Yakut Oblast Committee of the CPSU, said in his speech that according to geological exploration work, the Yakut Autonomous Republic is one of the richest warehouses in the Soviet Union, and many mineral deposits have been discovered in its territory, such as coal mines, tin mines, iron mines, gabbro mines, gold mines, rare elements and diffusion elements.

    Borisov said that the working people of the Yakut Autonomous Republic have decided that by 1965, diamond mining will increase nineteen times compared with 1958, while the Seven-Year Plan only stipulates an increase of thirteen times. The speaker emphasized the particularly rapid development of the people's culture in the Yakut Autonomous Republic. Here, 77 out of every 10,000 residents are studying in universities, while in the United States there are only 60 college students per 10,000 people, only 37 in the United Kingdom, and only 27 in France.

    Academician M.B. Mitin, Chairman of the Council of the All-Union Political and Scientific Knowledge Popularization Association, said in his speech: The 21st Congress presented a magnificent picture of the Soviet Communist Party's rock-solid unity and power, and a moving scene of the loving devotion of the fraternal communist and workers' parties to the Soviet Communist Party.

    He said that Khrushchev's report at the Congress showed how broad a world has been opened up for the development of national productive forces and the development of science and technology in the construction of communism. In this case, the shameful bankruptcy of the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin and Shepilov is particularly obvious. The complete victory of the Party's Marxist-Leninist line is becoming clearer and clearer.

    Mitin pointed out that Khrushchev's further development of the issue of socialist countries, especially the role that socialist countries should play in the period of comprehensive construction of communism, and the issue of the growing role of mass social organizations in managing state affairs, is an extremely valuable contribution to theory.

    Academician Mitin also talked about other theoretical principles expounded in Khrushchev's report that expounded the path to communism. He believes that clarifying the issue of collective farm construction belongs to these principles. Mitin said that in the next seven years, the issue of how to lead tens of millions of collective farmers to a communist society will be resolved.

    Finally, Academician Mitin emphasized that Khrushchev's report developed the lofty and great proposition of Marxism-Leninism, full of humanistic concern for world peace.

    After Academician Mitin's speech, the discussion of Khrushchev's report by the Congress ended.

    After a twenty-minute break, Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, made a concluding speech. After the adoption of various resolutions, the Congress successfully closed at 2:40 PM local time.

    对赫鲁晓夫报告进行了充分的讨论
    苏共代表大会展现壮丽图景
    新华社莫斯科4日电　苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会4日下午四时（莫斯科时间）在大克里姆林宫继续举行会议，讨论赫鲁晓夫同志的报告。
    苏共萨拉托夫州委员会第一书记杰尼索夫首先发言。他说，七年计划的实现将使苏维埃国家更加富强。现在，苏联地图上已经没有一个地区没有规定生产力的发展或者没有建立新的企业。发言人着重指出，在苏维埃国家里，有计划、按比例的发展经济的规律正在起着作用。
    在谈到萨拉托夫州的发展前景时，杰尼索夫说，到1965年，州内的化学工业产品将比1958年增加十七倍。
    杰尼索夫在发言中谈到了别尔乌辛和萨布罗夫在代表大会上检讨自己错误的发言。他说，别尔乌辛的发言不能令他满意，因为别尔乌辛的发言不够真诚老实。
    苏联部长会议国家化学委员会主席费多罗夫在发言中说，七年计划规定要大大增加化学工业的产品。他举出了增加化学产品生产的数字，同时强调指出，根据党中央委员会的倡议所通过的关于加速发展化学工业的决议表明，我们要尽快地建立聚合化学来供应国民经济的需要和增进人民的福利。
    费多罗夫说，石油加工企业以及拥有大量天然瓦斯储备的地区如巴什基尔自治共和国、俄罗斯联邦的库尔斯克州和萨拉托夫州、乌克兰的卢甘斯克州和斯坦尼斯拉夫州以及阿塞拜疆等地生产合成材料的能力特别大。在七年中上述这些地区将成为综合利用石油和瓦斯的主导地区，并且将生产大量的合成材料。
    在这方面费多罗夫强调指出，在石油加工厂中组织合成材料的生产是不需要大量投资就可以实现的。他指出，党所提出的加速发展化学工业的任务一定可以提前完成。
    接着发言的是苏联驻中国大使尤金院士。他在发言中详细地谈到了赫鲁晓夫同志的报告中所提出的理论问题。尤金说，七年计划不是向共产主义过渡的个别公式，而是向共产主义过渡的严密的科学计划。现在，凡是想理解共产主义是什么的人，除了马克思主义经典著作以外，都应该研究苏共第二十一次代表大会的文件。
    尤金接着说，由于工作关系，他曾亲眼见到中国人民在共产党领导下始终不渝地在建树具有历史意义的革命功绩。他说，中国正在全面展开社会主义社会建设。它已经比不久前同它站在同一水平的其他亚洲国家前进了整整一个时代。
    尤金还详细地谈到中国工业的增长，中国培养熟练专家干部的成就和中国农民所取得的成就。
    尤金强调指出，中国共产党是国际共产主义运动的一支光荣队伍。中国人民和中国共产党以自己的功绩博得了苏联人民和全人类的深切爱戴。他说，全世界都为中国的成就而欢呼，只有帝国主义者和不可救药的修正主义者才不高兴。
    尤金指出，南斯拉夫修正主义者在美国垄断资本帮助之下来宣传美国生活方式。美国帝国主义者是知道美元的价值是甚么的。南斯拉夫在经济方面已经受到美国的控制。
    尤金在谈到铁托同杜勒斯一道攻击中华人民共和国时说，铁托集团和美帝国主义者一同行动，这就揭破了修正主义者的伪装。乌拉尔重型机器制造厂厂长克罗托夫在发言时指出，七年计划提纲鼓舞着他们工厂的工人、工程师和设计师的创造热情。他说，根据他们提出的建议，正在起草方案把苏联最大的乌拉尔重型机器制造厂的生产能力提高50％，同时减少以前预定的基本投资一半。克罗托夫在发言中还表示支持代表大会上所提出的关于在乌拉尔重型机器制造厂成立科学研究所的建议。苏共沃罗涅日州（俄罗斯联邦）委员会第一书记什科尔尼科夫在发言中谈到了沃罗涅日州的工业发展任务、劳动人民的生产热情、以及工业方面提前一年完成七年计划的可能性。哈萨克共和国科学院院长萨特帕耶夫在发言中谈到了哈萨克的巨大成就和丰富的地下富源。他说，哈萨克已经勘探出二百多个煤产地和一千多个石油瓦斯结构。根据已经查明的铁矿蕴藏量，哈萨克居苏联前几位。共和国有大量锰矿。杰兹卡兹干铜矿的含铜量差不多比美国最好的铜矿含铜量多一倍。萨特帕耶夫指出，可以说，门德雷叶夫化学元素表上的元素，没有一种是哈萨克所没有的。发言人说，由于利用了哈萨克的天然富源，哈萨克在苏维埃政权建立以来，已经成为苏联一个工农业发达的共和国了。在下午会议上，以色列、玻利维亚、瑞士、冰岛和新西兰的兄弟党的代表向代表大会致了贺词，受到与会者的热烈欢迎。
    代表大会5日上午十时将继续举行会议。
    新华社莫斯科5日电　苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会今天上午十时（莫斯科时间）继续开会，结束了对赫鲁晓夫报告的讨论。
    在会上第一个发言的是苏共基辅州委员会书记彼得·谢列斯特。他说，基辅州的劳动人民开始执行1959年计划以来，已经取得了重要成就。今后七年中，基辅州各企业产量的增长差不多有65％将要靠提高劳动生产率来达到。为此，谢列斯特提出了在各工业部门更广泛地采用新的先进技术以及机械化和自动化的问题，因为，这将保证上述任务的解决。
    苏共鄂木斯克州委员会书记科卢申斯基在发言中说，1958年和1953年比较，鄂木斯克州集体农庄的收入增加了两倍半，这样就能够开始广泛地改建农村和改善农村的设施。在谈到鄂木斯克州的农业发展前景时，科卢申斯基指出，这个州的集体农民保证在三年内提前完成七年计划规定的肉类生产计划，在三、四年内完成七年计划规定的粮食生产计划。
    苏联科学院副院长康·奥斯特罗维季扬诺夫院士　在发言中分析了赫鲁晓夫在报告中提出的关于在苏联全面展开共产主义社会建设时期的一系列理论问题。他说，共产主义建设向社会科学提出了巨大的任务。经济学的任务是要能够解决共产主义建设中的问题。因此，必须把对学术的领导提高到更高的水平。奥斯特罗维季扬诺夫院士主张苏联科学院经济研究所与苏联国家计划委员会、各国民经济委员会和其他国民经济机关建立密切的联系。他说，经济学家必须把共产主义建设实践提出的任务作为自己的研究工作的基础。
    苏共雅库特州委员会第一书记鲍里索夫在发言中说，据地质勘探工作表明，雅库特自治共和国是苏联最富庶的仓库之一，它的境内发现了许多矿藏，如煤矿、锡矿、铁矿、辉长岩矿、金矿、稀有元素和扩散元素等。
    鲍里索夫说，雅库特自治共和国劳动人民决定，到1965年，钻石开采量将比1958年增加十九倍，而七年计划控制数字只规定增加十三倍。发言人着重指出了雅库特自治共和国人民文化的特别迅速的发展。这里，一万居民中就有七十七个人在高等学校学习，而在美国，每一万人中只有六十名大学生，在英国只有三十七名，在法国只有二十七名。
    全苏政治和科学知识普及协会理事会主席马·鲍·米丁院士在发言中说：第二十一次代表大会展现了苏联共产党的坚如磐石的团结和威力的壮丽图景，展现了各兄弟共产党和工人党对苏联共产党爱戴的动人情景。
    他说，赫鲁晓夫在代表大会上的报告表明：在共产主义建设中，为发展全国生产力和发展科学技术开辟了多么广阔的天地。在这种情况下，马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团的可耻破产是特别明显了。党的马克思列宁主义路线的完全胜利是愈来愈显得清楚了。
    米丁指出，赫鲁晓夫对社会主义国家问题，特别是对社会主义国家在全面展开共产主义建设的时期应当起的作用问题以及对群众性的社会团体在管理国家事务中日益增长的作用问题的进一步发展，是对理论的极其宝贵的贡献。
    米丁院士还谈到赫鲁晓夫报告中提出的阐述向共产主义前进的道路的其它一些理论原理。他认为，阐明集体农庄建设问题就是属于这些原理的。米丁说，在今后七年中，将解决如何把几千万集体农民引向共产主义社会去的问题。
    米丁院士最后着重指出，赫鲁晓夫的报告发展了马克思列宁主义的、充满着对世界和平的关怀的人道主义的崇高而伟大的主张。
    米丁院士发言以后，代表大会对赫鲁晓夫的报告的讨论至此结束。
    会议休息二十分钟后，苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫作了总结发言。在通过各项决议后，大会在当地时间十四时四十分胜利闭幕。
