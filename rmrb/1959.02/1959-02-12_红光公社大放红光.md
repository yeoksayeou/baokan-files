(Reported from Chengdu, February 11) The Hongguang People's Commune in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, located in the Dujiangyan irrigation area, has shone brilliantly since its establishment. In just over four months, it has fully demonstrated the superiority of the commune, further liberating productive forces and advancing towards agricultural mechanization and electrification by leaps and bounds.

	This year's spring plowing can be fully mechanized
The Hongguang Commune is formed by the merger of 59 agricultural cooperatives, with more than 60,000 members and 112,000 mu of cultivated land. This fertile and flat land is ideal for mechanized farming. As soon as the commune was established, it purchased 46 tractors from the state (equivalent to 126 standard units). Each management area has a tractor team, and this year's spring plowing can be fully mechanized. This was impossible in the past. Agricultural cooperatives generally had only about 100 households, and their small size meant they were weak. Their annual accumulation was less than 10,000 yuan, so they could not afford tractors. Moreover, small cooperatives were unable to alter the crisscrossing canals. Limited by crop rotation, the land could only be combined into fields of 20 to 30 mu at most, making mechanized farming inconvenient. This area is the focus of Sichuan Province's promotion of mechanized farming. A tractor station was established in 1954, but before the establishment of the commune, most agricultural cooperatives still could not achieve mechanized farming. After the establishment of the Hongguang People's Commune, it had more than 6 million yuan in public accumulation, with sufficient resources to purchase various agricultural machines. The commune's land was combined into large blocks of 100 to 200 mu each, according to the crops in continuous plots and mechanized farming into blocks, allowing tractors to run freely. The implementation of mechanized farming not only saves a lot of manpower, livestock, and time, but will also increase crop yields. The facts over the years have proven that, under the same soil quality and cultivation techniques, wheat grown on mechanized land yields 20%-30% more than non-mechanized land; rapeseed yields 10%-15% more; and rice yields 5%-10% more.

	Comprehensive Reform of the Irrigation System
This people's commune, located in the heart of the Dujiangyan irrigation area, has all its land under gravity irrigation. However, in the past, such favorable water conservancy conditions were not rationally used. In the era of individual peasant economy, water disputes often occurred. In addition, many ditches were dug arbitrarily from the perspective of individual households, not only occupying a large amount of land, but also seriously affecting crop growth due to the high groundwater level and low soil temperature. During the period of agricultural cooperatives, this situation changed significantly. Disputes between households were eliminated, some low-yielding, damp fields were converted into good fields, and some unreasonable ditches were reconstructed. However, many contradictions still existed between townships and cooperatives in water use. The renovation of ditches and the transformation of damp fields could not be thoroughly resolved because they were carried out within a small scope. By the time the commune was established, there were still damp fields accounting for about 10% of the commune's cultivated land. The emergence of the Hongguang People's Commune has solved the long-standing water use problem. The commune has newly built 20 sluice gates within a 30-li radius, releasing and using water according to production needs. When watering the spring crops recently, every piece of land could receive water on time and in the right amount. At the same time, the commune, starting from the overall situation, carried out a comprehensive adjustment of the water system. Only half of the existing more than 10,000 branch ditches and small weirs are needed. The commune will not only reclaim a batch of land from these abandoned ditches, but will also effectively transform damp fields. The abundant water resources have also been comprehensively utilized. The commune has newly established seven hydropower stations, plus the original three hydropower stations, and it will soon be possible to have an average of 100 kilowatt-hours of electricity per person. The commune's existing 150 water mills are being converted into hydropower stations, using hydraulic power to thresh and process grain and feed. This year, the commune will realize mechanization and semi-mechanization in seven major areas: cultivation, transportation, sowing, transplanting, threshing, feed processing, and pest control; most areas will have electric lighting.

	Large-scale Development of Diversified Economy
Due to its large size and population, the Hongguang People's Commune correctly implemented the production policy of simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture, and simultaneously promoting self-sufficiency and commodity production. This changed the past situation of being all rice fields, with simple crops, making it difficult to develop a diversified economy. In the past, the development of diversified economy was not good here. A big reason was that the scale of the cooperatives was small, and funds, land, and talents were limited. If grain production was emphasized, other aspects could not be taken care of. Generally, agricultural cooperatives only operated four or five diversified economic projects. After the establishment of the Hongguang Commune, it ranked all the technical personnel in the commune and formed more than 600 specialized groups. The commune extracted a large amount of funds and allocated a portion of land, and vigorously engaged in diversified operations based on the characteristics of the plain area. The operating projects quickly expanded to more than 20 types, such as beekeeping, dairy cows, rice-fish farming, poultry, and livestock, all of which have been greatly developed. In less than three months, it has generated an income of 450,000 yuan. Recently, it has signed a contract with the commercial departments worth 1 million yuan. In this way, the problem of "more grain and less money," which had not been solved in the past when the cooperatives were small, has been quickly changed, ensuring that members receive wages on a monthly basis, and gradually increasing them.
	In the past, there was almost no industry in agricultural cooperatives. Now the commune has established 65 factories. Although the factories have not been built for long, all factories have increased production and all factories have surpluses. The total industrial output value has reached more than 1 million yuan. These commune-run factories produce large amounts of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, building materials, indigenous steel and iron, as well as bamboo and wood appliances, and processed agricultural products.

	As soon as the Hongguang Commune was established, it invested in the intense national iron smelting movement and the four-autumn blitz. More than 12,000 strong laborers out of the commune's more than 29,000 laborers were transferred to the mountains to smelt iron and participate in commune-run industries, and the amount of labor used in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries also increased greatly. Under such circumstances, due to the commune's large-scale collective welfare undertakings, and unified scheduling, overall arrangement, and rational use based on the strength of labor and different types of work, the labor potential of all commune members, especially female commune members, has been greatly brought into play. With the increase of large-scale agricultural machinery and the reform of tools, the result was a victorious completion of various arduous tasks. The four-autumn work was done faster and better than any previous year, ensuring the effective implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. More than 60,000 mu of wheat and rapeseed fields were plowed to a depth of 1.5 to 2 feet or more on 80% of the area. In the past, these two crops were rarely fertilized with base fertilizer, or even not fertilized at all. This time, more than 50,000 jin of base fertilizer was applied per mu, and layered fertilization was carried out. All wheat and rapeseed are of improved varieties. The amount of wheat seeds used per mu has increased from about 20 jin in the past to about 50 jin, and the amount of rapeseed per mu has increased from 4,000 nests in the past to 10,000 nests. Now, wheat and rapeseed have been top-dressed twice and irrigated once, and the seedlings are growing particularly vigorously.

	Double Cropping Rice Increases by More Than Double
	96% of members Increase Income

For a long time, there has been an argument that in high-yield areas like the West Sichuan Plain, further efforts can only increase production by a few percent, and it is impossible to double it. This statement is now refuted by the facts. Before the establishment of the commune, the advanced cooperatives won a great victory in terms of early rice. The average yield of early rice per mu jumped from more than 500 jin in the past to 1,200 jin. In September, the Hongguang Commune was established, and the late rice had already been planted. The commune immediately strengthened field management, increased fertilizer application, rationally irrigated water, diligently controlled pests, and made a concerted effort to achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest of 30,000 mu of late rice, increasing production by more than double compared to the previous year. Subsequently, they seized the opportunity to increase the planting of a season of late autumn crops. The commune's total annual grain output increased by one and a half times compared to the previous year, an increase exceeding the total of the eight years since liberation; the average person had 3,000 jin of grain, 90% of which was refined grain. With the rapid development of diversified economy and commune-run industries, according to the recent settlement, the total income from various productions last year reached 14.68 million yuan, an increase of 143% compared to the previous year. After deducting taxes and production costs, the net income reached more than 10 million yuan. As a result of the distribution, the commune's accumulation increased nearly tenfold compared to when it was a small cooperative, and the income of members also generally increased. The income of 96.3% of the members increased, with an average net increase of 17 yuan per person compared to the previous year, and the income of the remaining members did not decrease either.

	Masses' material and cultural life have been greatly improved
The rapid development of industrial and agricultural production has laid a solid foundation for further changing people's lives. Since November of last year, the commune has begun to implement a distribution system combining wages and supplies. In terms of the supply system, it has implemented free meals. The food level of all 200 or so canteens in the commune has reached and exceeded that of the local wealthy middle peasants. In addition, the commune, adhering to the principle of "large collective, small freedom," combined the distribution of income and distributed a certain amount of materials to the members: 100 jin of grain per household, 4 jin of pork per person, and 1 yuan of vegetables, to supply members with some snacks and side dishes at home. In terms of wages, since November of last year, each labor force has had an average wage of 4 yuan, which was increased to 6 yuan in January this year.

Many collective welfare undertakings have been established. The commune has established 230 nurseries, 105 kindergartens, and 2 homes for the elderly. Each brigade also has sewing, laundry, and hairdressing organizations, which charge only a small fee. The commune also has 64 elementary schools and 6 complete elementary schools, and elementary education has been popularized. There are 6 middle schools, 17 spare-time schools, as well as 5 hospitals, 7 maternity hospitals, and 7 health centers. The cultural life of the members is becoming more and more rich and colorful. The commune has two film projection teams, and each member can watch two films per month. The amateur cultural troupe and broadcasting station set up in the commune, as well as the clubs in the brigades, also often perform for the members. All teams subscribe to newspapers. In terms of housing, a new type of residential area that can accommodate 10,000 households—the 10,000-person new village—is being surveyed, and construction will begin in March this year.

    红光公社大放红光
    本报成都11日电　位于四川都江堰流域的郫县红光人民公社成立后大放异采，在短短四个多月中就充分显示出公社的优越性，进一步解放生产力，大踏步向农业机械化、电气化前进。
        今年春耕可以全部实现机械耕作
    红光公社是由五十九个农业社合并组成的，有社员六万多人，耕地十一万二千多亩。这片肥沃、平坦的土地，是最理想的机械耕作场地。公社一建立，就向国家购买了四十六台拖拉机（折合一百二十六个标准台），每个管理区都有一个拖拉机队，今年春耕可以全部实行机械耕作。这在过去是办不到的。农业社一般只有百户左右，社小力弱，全年积累不到万元，买不起拖拉机；再则，社小也无力改变犬牙交错的渠道；限于作物轮作，田土最多只能合成二、三十亩大的田块，实行机耕诸多不便。这里是四川省推行机耕的重点，1954年就建立了拖拉机站，但到公社成立前，大部分农业社仍不能实现机耕。红光人民公社成立后，拥有六百多万元的公共积累，有足够力量购买各种农业机械。全社土地根据作物连片、机耕成块，因地制宜地合并为一百亩到二百亩的大块，任拖拉机尽情奔驰。实行机耕不仅节省大量人力、畜力和时间，还将提高农作物的产量。几年来的事实证明，在土质和栽培技术相同的条件下，小麦机耕地比非机耕地增产20％—30％；油菜机耕地增产10％—15％；水稻机耕地增产5％—10％。
              全面改革灌溉系统
    这个位于都江堰灌区腹心地带的人民公社，全部土地都是自流灌溉。但是，在过去，这样有利的水利条件并未得到合理使用。个体农民经济时代，经常发生争水纠纷。另外，许多沟渠是从一家一户的利益出发，随意乱挖，不仅占用了大量土地，还因地下水位高，土壤的温度低，严重影响作物生长。农业社时，这种情况有很大改变，户与户间的纠纷消除了，有些低产的下湿田改成了好田，有些不合理的沟渠改建了。但是，在用水上，乡与乡、社与社之间仍存有不少矛盾。对沟渠的整修和下湿田的改造，也因局限于小范围内进行，不能彻底地解决。到公社成立时，还有约占全社耕地10％的下湿田。红光人民公社的出现，长期存在的用水问题就迎刃而解，全社在方圆三十华里的土地内新建了二十个闸门，根据生产需要放水用水。最近浇灌小春作物时，使每块田土都能按时按量得到用水。与此同时，公社从全局出发，对水系进行全面调整，现有的一万多条支沟、小堰，只要一半就够了。全社不仅将从这些废弃的沟渠中开出一批土地，还将有效地改造下湿田。丰富的水利资源也得到综合利用，全社新建立了七个水电站，加上原有的三个水电站，不需很久的时间即可做到每人平均有电一百度。全社现有的一百五十座水碾，正在改建为水动力站，用水力作动力进行脱粒以及粮食和饲料加工。今年内全社要在耕作、运输、播种、插秧、脱粒、饲料加工、防治虫害等七项主要工具上实现机械化和半机械化；大部地区有电灯照明。
              大量发展多种经济
    红光人民公社由于社大人多，正确地贯彻了工业和农业同时并举，自给生产和商品生产同时并举的生产方针，改变了过去全是稻田，作物单纯，难于发展多种经济的局面。过去这里多种经济发展不够好，很大的原因是社的规模小，资金、土地和人才都有限，抓住粮食生产，其他方面就照顾不到。一般农业社经营多种经济的项目只有四、五种。红光公社成立后，将全社各项技术人员进行排队，分门别类组成了六百多个专业小组，社里抽出大批资金和划出一部分土地，根据平原地区的特点，大搞多种经营。经营项目很快扩大到二十多种，如像养蜂、奶牛、稻田养鱼、家禽家畜等都大量发展起来了，在不到三个月的时间内，收入了四十五万元。最近又和商业部门签订了价值一百万元的合同。这样，便迅速改变了过去小社时一直不能解决的“粮多钱少”的问题，保证社员按月发放工资，并逐步有所增加。
    过去在农业社时，几乎都没有工业，现在公社已建立了六十五个工厂。虽然建厂都不久，但是厂厂增产、厂厂盈余，工业总产值已达一百多万元。这些社办工厂生产了大量化肥、农药、建筑材料、土钢土铁、以及竹木器具、农产品加工品等。
    红光公社刚一成立，就投入了紧张的全民炼铁运动和四秋突击工作。全社两万九千多个劳动力就抽调了一万二千多个强劳力上山炼铁和参加社办工业，而农、林、牧、副、渔等各方面的生产用工量也大大增加。在这种情况下，由于公社大办集体福利事业，又根据劳力强弱，不同的活路，统一调度，全面安排和合理使用，从而使全体社员特别是妇女社员的劳动潜力大大发挥出来，再加大型农业机械的增加和工具的改革，结果胜利完成各项繁重的任务。四秋工作比过去任何一年都做得又快又好，保证了农业“八字宪法”的切实贯彻执行。六万多亩小麦和油菜田，有80％深耕一尺五寸至二尺以上。过去这两种作物施底肥很少，甚至不施底肥，这次每亩施底肥五万斤以上，并做到分层施肥。小麦和油菜全部是良种，小麦每亩用种量由过去二十斤左右增加为五十斤左右，油菜每亩由过去的四千窝增加到一万窝。现在小麦和油菜都已施了二道追肥，灌了一道水，苗架生长得特别茁壮。
      双季稻增产一倍多
        96％的社员增加收入
    长期以来有一种论调，硬说像川西平原这样的高产区，再努力只能增产百分之几，不可能翻番。这种说法，现在在事实面前不攻自破了。公社成立前，各高级社就在早稻方面打了一个大胜仗，早稻亩产平均由过去的五百多斤，一跃而达到一千二百斤。9月份红光公社成立，当时晚稻已经栽上。公社立即加强了田间管理，增施肥料，合理灌水，勤治虫害，一鼓作气使三万亩晚稻获得空前丰收，比上一年增产一倍以上。随后，他们抓紧时机，又增种了一季晚秋作物，全社全年粮食总产量比上一年增产一倍半，增产幅度超过了解放以来八年的总和；每人平均有粮三千斤，其中90％都是细粮。加上多种经济和社办工业的飞跃发展，根据最近结算，去年全年各项生产总收入达一千四百六十八万元，比前年增加143％。除去税收和生产费用，纯收入达一千多万元。分配结果，公社积累比小社时增加近十倍，社员收入也普遍提高，96.3％的社员增加收入，平均每人比上年净增十七元，其余社员的收入也没有减少。
                群众物质生活和文化生活有很大改善
    工农业生产的飞跃发展，为进一步改变人民生活打下了巩固基础。公社从去年11月份起，开始实行了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，在供给制方面，实行了吃饭不要钱，全社二百多个食堂，伙食水平赶上和超过了当地富裕中农。另外，该社还本着“大集体、小自由”的原则，结合处理分配收入，分配了一定的实物给社员：每户一百斤粮食，每人四斤猪肉和一元钱的菜蔬，供应社员平时在家做些小吃、小菜。工资部分，从去年11月份起，每个劳动力平均有工资四元，今年1月份又增加为六元。
    许多集体福利事业兴办起来了。全社建立了托儿所二百三十个、幼儿园一百零五个、敬老院二个。各个大队还设立有缝纫、洗衣、理发等组织，只收少许的费用。全社还举办有初小六十四所，完全小学六所，小学教育已普及。中学有六所，业余学校有十七所，此外还有医院五所，妇产院七所，保健所七个。社员的文化生活越来越丰富多彩，全社有两个电影放映队，每个社员每月能看两场电影。公社里设立的业余文工团、广播站以及大队里的俱乐部也经常为社员演出。队队都订有报纸。在住的方面，一个可供万户居住的新型居民点——万人新村，正在勘测，今年3月份就可动工兴建。　（文圭火）
