    In Cooperation with Factories to Establish Labor Sites for Cultivating the Second Generation
    Many Workshops Set Up in Beijing Middle Schools

    (Our report) Beijing - Nearly one hundred middle schools in urban Beijing have recently established cooperative relationships with fifty-five factories and fifty-eight schools under the unified arrangement of the Party and the government, setting up more than one hundred and twenty workshops in schools. Many more factories will continue to establish more workshops in schools according to the schools' needs.
    The Beijing municipal Party organizations and government recently summarized this method of factories setting up workshops in schools, believing that it is a good way to organize students to participate in productive labor. After the specific organization of the education and industrial departments, this practice has now been vigorously promoted in urban areas, organizing some central and municipal factories to set up workshops in schools. In addition to the district-run factories organized by the districts to set up workshops in schools, the majority of middle schools in urban areas will have fixed workshops set up by factories in schools. Only seven modern state-owned factories, such as the North China Radio Joint Equipment Factory, Beijing Wire Factory, Beijing Switch Factory, Beijing Glass Factory, Beijing Comprehensive Instrument Factory, Beijing Chemical Factory, and Beijing Electron Tube Factory, have now begun to set up workshops in thirty-eight schools in Dongcheng, Xicheng, Chongwen and other districts. These workshops are generally related to teaching and include types such as electrical engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and instrumentation.
    According to the practice of some schools in the previous stage, setting up workshops in schools has many advantages: for schools, factories are responsible for solving problems such as production equipment, raw materials, transportation, and sales, so schools can concentrate on organizing students' learning and labor better. First of all, schools can actively arrange students' learning and labor time according to a unified education plan, and ensure that the content of productive labor is adapted to the students' age, gender, and physical condition, and is combined with the relevant courses of each grade as much as possible. In junior high schools, generally simpler types of work are arranged, while in senior high schools, more complex types of work such as electrical engineering, chemical engineering, and mechanical engineering are arranged. This also makes productive labor regular and systematic in these schools. Productive labor is placed in the curriculum along with other subjects and becomes an integral part of the school's entire education. Because the workshops are located in the schools, it is easier to connect theory with practice in teaching. At the same time, students can see the results of their labor by participating in productive labor in the workshops, which makes it easier to arouse their interest and enthusiasm for labor than participating in some non-fixed labor. In addition, it also facilitates teachers to participate in labor training and connect with reality.
    While implementing the above methods, Beijing's urban middle schools will maintain and appropriately adjust the various forms of productive labor that students originally participated in, according to the specific conditions of each school. After arranging fixed and regular labor, these schools can still plan and prepare to send students to the countryside and factories for one or two weeks during the busy farming season or when factories need them, allowing students to more broadly connect with social reality and with the workers and peasants.

    同工厂协作建立培养第二代的劳动场所
    北京各中学设立大批车间
    本报讯　北京市城区的近百所中学，最近在党和政府的统一安排下已有五十五个工厂和五十八个学校建立了协作关系，在学校建立一百二十多个车间。还有许多工厂将根据学校的需要，继续到学校设立更多的车间。
    北京市的党组织和政府最近总结了这种工厂在学校设车间的办法，认为这是组织学生参加劳动生产的一种良好的形式。经过教育部门和工业部门的具体组织，现在已在城区大力推广这种做法，组织一些中央和市属工厂到学校设立车间，加上各区所组织的区属工厂在学校设立的车间，城区的多数中学都将有工厂在学校设立的固定车间，仅华北无线电联合器材厂、北京有线电厂、北京开关厂、北京玻璃厂、北京综合仪器厂、北京化工厂和北京电子管厂等七个现代化国营大工厂，现在已开始分别到东城、西城、崇文等区的三十八个学校设立车间。这些车间一般都是和教学有联系的，有电工、化工、机工和仪表等几种类型。
    根据前一阶段一些学校的实践证明，工厂在学校设车间这种做法好处很多：对学校来说，生产设备、原料、运输、销售等问题工厂已负责解决，学校可以集中精力把学生的学习和劳动组织得更好。首先，学校能够根据统一的教育计划主动地安排学生的学习和劳动时间，并使生产劳动的内容能够与学生的年龄、性别、体力情况相适应，与各年级的有关课程尽量地结合起来，在初中学生中，一般安排了比较简单的工种，在高中学生中，则安排了电工、化工、机械等比较复杂的工种。这样也使得劳动生产在这些学校经常化、制度化了，劳动生产和其他功课一样排列到课程表内，成为学校整个教育中的一个组成部分。由于车间设在学校，在教学方面也就更便于理论联系实际。同时，学生在车间里参加生产劳动，可以看到劳动的成果，比起参加一些不固定的劳动来，更容易引起他们的劳动兴趣和劳动热情。另外，也便利了教师参加劳动锻炼和联系实际。
    北京城区各中学在实行上述办法的同时，对于学生们原来参加各种生产劳动的形式仍将根据各校的具体情况予以保持和适当的调整。这些学校在安排了固定的经常的劳动以后，每年仍可在农忙时，在工厂需要时有计划、有准备地抽出一、两个星期的时间下乡下厂参加劳动。让学生更广泛地联系社会实际和联系工农群众。
