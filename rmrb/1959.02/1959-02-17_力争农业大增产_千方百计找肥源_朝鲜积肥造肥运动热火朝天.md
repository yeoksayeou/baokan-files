Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 15th: To surpass the target of producing five million tons of grain this year, farmers in northern Korea have launched a vigorous campaign to collect and produce fertilizer. Regardless of the freezing weather, farmers are going up the mountains to sweep up fallen leaves, going down to the rivers to dig river mud, extracting peat, and producing indigenous chemical fertilizer, exploring fertilizer sources by every possible means. They have collected several times more fertilizer than in previous years. According to statistics from the Korean Ministry of Agriculture, from last winter to January of this year, agricultural cooperatives in various regions have already exceeded the target set by Premier Kim Il-sung to produce 100 million tons of self-supplied fertilizer annually nationwide. This fertilizer is now being transported to the fields in large quantities.

Farmers in South Pyongan Province have achieved the greatest success in fertilizer collection. They have manufactured many wooden indigenous machines, which have greatly promoted the increase in fertilizer production. To date, they have collected more than 32 million tons of fertilizer, which is ten times that of the same period last year. In order to implement the method of intensive cultivation with less planting and more harvesting, and greatly increase rice production, farmers in this province plan to apply 200 tons of fertilizer per chongbo (approximately 15 mu) in 100,000 chongbo of paddy fields. Farmers in South Hamgyong Province have also collected more than 15 million tons of fertilizer, which is eight times that of the same period last year. In the days of heavy snowfall, agricultural cooperatives in various regions used sleds made by the cooperative members themselves to transport fertilizer, which greatly improved the efficiency of fertilizer transportation.

The 6,289 indigenous chemical fertilizer plants built by agricultural cooperatives in various regions produced more than 34,000 tons of indigenous chemical fertilizer in just one month. According to chemical analysis, the fertilizer effect of the indigenous chemical fertilizer produced by agricultural cooperatives in Jagang Province is approximately six to seven times that of the same amount of human and animal waste.

    力争农业大增产　千方百计找肥源
    朝鲜积肥造肥运动热火朝天
    新华社平壤15日电　朝鲜北部各地农民为了超额完成今年生产五百万吨粮食的任务，展开了热火朝天的积肥造肥运动。农民们不顾天寒地冻，上山扫落叶，下河挖河泥，掏泥炭，造土化肥，千方百计地开辟肥源，积了比往年多几倍的肥料，据朝鲜农业省统计，从去年冬天起到今年1月份为止，各地农业社已经超额完成了金日成首相指示的每年全国生产自给肥料一亿吨的指标，现在这些肥料已经大量运到田中。
    平安南道农民们积肥成绩最大。他们自造了许多木制土机械，大大地促进了肥料的增产，到目前为止已积肥三千二百多万吨，等于去年同期的十倍。为了实行少种多收的精耕细作的办法，大大增产稻谷，这个道的农民要在十万町步水田中每町步（约合十五亩）施肥二百吨。咸镜南道的农民也已经积了一千五百多万吨肥料，等于去年同时期的八倍。在大雪纷飞的日子里，各地农业社都用社员自己制造的雪橇运肥，大大提高了运肥效率。
    各地农业社自建的六千二百八十九所土化肥厂，在仅仅一个月间就生产了三万四千多吨土化肥。慈江道的农业社生产的土化肥，根据化验证明肥效约等于同等数量的人粪尿的六、七倍。
