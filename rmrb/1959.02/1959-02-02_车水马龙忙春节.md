The Spring Festival is Busy with Heavy Traffic
Seizing Every Minute, Not Skimping on Quantity
    Flipping through the calendar, there are only a few days left until the Spring Festival. These days, the employees of the Beijing Transportation Company are working day and night to rush the transportation of Spring Festival supplies, so that the people of the capital can celebrate the first Spring Festival in the Great Leap Forward in a lively and joyful atmosphere.
    At the railway station, as long as the goods that arrive are for the festival or are daily necessities, cars, horse-drawn carts, and tricycles are dispatched for a concentrated unloading operation, no matter when they arrive. In order to prevent any accumulation on the station's loading platforms, the business dispatch department of the transportation company urges the materials department to distribute the goods on the spot as soon as a shipment arrives. If the consignee doesn't take delivery, they will deliver it to their door; if there is no warehouse, they will help them find temporary storage. Freeing up one more loading and unloading space means one more freight car can be unloaded. For this reason, the transportation company has also organized a complete set of personnel. How much cargo arrives, how many tools to use, what kind of cargo arrives, what kind of tools to use, each has a different "battle plan." Recently, seven to eight hundred cars, horse-drawn carts, and nearly a thousand tricycles are dispatched every day to distribute tens of thousands of tons of festival goods and daily necessities to warehouses, shops, and users.

        Hoping for Cold Weather in the Depth of Winter
    Although the non-staple foods are scattered and fragmented, making transportation more troublesome, the transportation workers still tried their best to complete the task on time. Not long ago, two million catties of persimmons from Zhoukoudian were due to be transported, but because the weather was relatively warm, the persimmons were soft and inconvenient to load onto vehicles. How nice it would be to have a cold day! The car drivers waited and waited, but the weather always seemed to be joking with them. On "Laba" day, the cold weather finally arrived. The temperature in Beijing suddenly dropped to fourteen or fifteen degrees below zero, and the persimmons froze. This made the car drivers very happy, and they launched a race against time, starting early and working late. When their hands froze, they stopped the car, breathed on their hands, and then drove dozens of miles with this burst of warmth; when their feet went numb, they jumped out of the car to move around before continuing. With this kind of soaring drive, they went out under the stars and returned with the moon, distributing tons of coal to the stoves of every household, and stuffing tens of thousands of catties of cotton into the clothes of adults and children. The transportation workers used their own cold to exchange for the warmth of thousands of households.

        Every Little Bit is Hard-Earned
    Candies and pastries are even more difficult to deal with. Some are afraid of the cold, some are afraid of the heat, some are afraid of being squeezed, and some are afraid of being crushed. The red-cheeked apples are like newly born babies, unable to withstand even a little cold. In order to prevent the apples from catching a cold on the road, the drivers could only eat during loading and unloading, sometimes only managing to eat one hot meal a day. Transporting fruits requires moving quickly, but transporting loose packages of pastries requires a steady and slow pace, daring neither to touch them nor to bump them, as any touch or bump would rub off a layer of skin.
    The most difficult "guests" to serve are the live pigs. Once they are on the vehicle, the vehicle cannot stop, let alone spend the night outdoors. If the vehicle stops, the pigs will desperately try to escape from the net, and they are sure to freeze to death if they spend the night in the cold weather. In order to ensure that these "guests" arrive safely at their destination, the drivers adopted a method of two drivers per vehicle, taking turns driving. When they were hungry, they chewed on some "dry rations" to fill their stomachs, and when they were sleepy, they took a nap in the vehicle.

        Everyone Celebrates the First Day, We Celebrate the Fifteenth
    During festivals, the transportation department becomes even busier. Not being able to go home for a reunion dumpling dinner on "New Year's Eve" has become a habit for the drivers. For the sake of thousands upon thousands of passengers, all the employees of the transportation company unanimously stated that they would not take holidays during the Spring Festival. The drivers went out to drive, and the cadres went down to the station to work as ticket sellers and service personnel. They said: If we don't go home, we can let thousands of people go home for reunions, which is a great pleasure. He Shuojun, deputy director of the Jiulongshan Motor Vehicle Depot, joked with me: It's the same every year, everyone celebrates "the first day," we celebrate "the fifteenth." Wu Shuwen, a driver from the First Team of the Long-Distance Bus Company, postponed his wedding by several months in order not to delay Spring Festival operations. How many people, other than Wu Shuwen, who had long planned to get married during the Spring Festival holiday, did not mention it to their leaders?

      Doing Our Best to Serve You
    These days, the comrades at the long-distance bus company's passenger and freight terminal are launching a movement to offer suggestions and ideas, to see who can come up with the best ideas to serve passengers thoughtfully.
    Resolution letters are being submitted to the Party Committee, and dazibao (big-character posters) are plastered on the walls of the station.
    In order to encourage employees and students from government offices, enterprises, factories, and schools to stagger their holidays and avoid everyone traveling together at the same time, which would overwhelm the vehicles, the station director personally went out to investigate the flow, direction, and timing of passengers in order to concentrate ticket sales and transport them in batches. The windows of the bus station are open day and night, and tickets can be bought at any time, without having to stand in line for a long time.
    They thought that guests returning home for the Spring Festival would be bringing the old and the young, as well as a lot of luggage. It would be very inconvenient for them to come to the station to board the bus in such cold weather. They should drive the buses to places where passengers are more concentrated, which would not only save the passengers trouble but also save a small amount of handling fees.
    The Great Leap Forward and the Great Construction have greatly changed the appearance of the hometown. If guests walk in the dark after getting off the bus, will they get lost? The comrades in the dispatch room have studied the departure and arrival times of each route for this matter, so that passengers can arrive a little earlier, making it easier to find directions and ask for information, and also to see the new face of their hometown as soon as possible.
    Don't guests want to bring some "New Year's goods" home for the festival? Someone else came up with a good idea: attach a trailer to the back of the passenger car, specializing in less-than-carload transportation, which is sure to be popular with passengers.

    Dear readers, when you read this fragmented newsletter, perhaps you have already embarked on the journey home; perhaps you and your family are happily talking about small stories in the Great Leap Forward; perhaps you have just bought fresh fruits and vegetables from the retail store... Whenever this happens, can you not feel grateful from the bottom of your heart to those transportation workers who work hard day and night for us! (Lian Xiang)

### 车水马龙忙春节

    车水马龙忙春节
    分秒必争　斤两不压
    翻开日历，离春节只有几天了。这些天，北京市运输公司的职工正在夜以继日抢运春节物资，为的是让首都人民热热闹闹、高高兴兴欢度大跃进中的第一个春节。
    火车站上，只要来的是过节物品和日用百货，什么时候到货，什么时候汽车、马车、三轮车就一齐突击搬运。为了不让车站的货台有一点积压，运输公司的商务调度部门，每到一车货，紧跟着就催促物资部门就地分配；货主不担货，就主动送上门去；没有仓库，还替他们找好临时堆栈。能多腾出一个装卸货位，就能多甩一个车皮。为这事，运输公司还组织了成套人马，到多少货、用多少工具，到什么货、用什么工具，各有不同的“作战方案”。最近，每天都要出动七、八百辆汽车、马车和近千辆的三轮货车，把上万吨的过节物品和日用百货分送到仓库、商店和用户手里。
        十冬腊月盼冷天
    尽管副食品零星分散，运输起来比较麻烦，运输工人还是想尽一切办法按时完成了任务。不久前，周口店的二百万斤柿子就该起运了，只因为天气比较暖和，柿子稀软，不便装车。能有个大冷天该多好呢！汽车司机左盼右盼，天气总是和他们开玩笑。“腊八”这一天，冷天总算盼到了。北京的气温突然下降到零下十四、五度，柿子冻了。这一下可乐坏了汽车司机，起早贪黑和时间展开了争夺战。手冻僵了，停下车来，呵呵手，趁着这股子热气，又赶它几十里；脚发麻了，跳下车来活动活动再走。凭着这种冲天的干劲，他们顶着星星出去，带着月亮回来；把成吨的煤炭分添到每家每户的炉子里；把上万斤的棉花絮在大人小孩的衣服里；运输工人用他们自己的寒冷，换得了千家万户的温暖。
        一星一点当思来处不易
    糖果糕点就更难对付，有的怕冷，有的怕热，有的怕挤，有的怕压。红脸蛋的苹果真像刚出生的娇儿，一点冷也受不得。为了不让苹果在路上着凉，司机们只能抽装卸的时候吃饭，有时一天只能摸上一顿热饭。运水果要跑得快一点，可是装运散包的糕点又得稳步慢行，既不敢碰着，也不敢颠着，一碰一颠就要蹭掉一层皮。
    最难伺候的“客人”要数毛猪了。只要它们一上车，车就不敢停下来，更不敢露天过夜。停下车来猪就拼命往网外奔，冷天过夜准得冻死。为了让这些“客人”平安到达目的地，司机同志采取一车两人、轮流驾驶的办法，饿了就嚼点“干粮”充饥，困了就在车上打个盹。
        大家过初一　咱们过十五
    逢年过节，运输部门就倍加繁忙，“三十”晚上不能回家吃一顿团圆饺子，这已成了司机的习惯了。为了千千万万的旅客，运输公司的全体职工一致表示春节期间不休假，司机开车去了，干部下到车站，又当售票员，又当服务员。他们说：咱们不回家，能让成千上万的人都回家团聚，便是天大的乐事。九龙山汽车场何硕俊副场长曾和我开玩笑地说：年年如此，大家过“初一”，咱们过“十五”。长途汽车公司第一车队司机吴树文同志，为了不耽搁春节出车，把自己的婚期往后推迟了几个月。没有向领导开过口，而早就打算春节假日结婚的人，何止吴树文一人呢？
      千方百计为您忙
    这几天，长途汽车公司客货运总站的同志正在开展一个献计献策的运动，看谁能想出最好的主意，为旅客服务得周到。
    一张张的决心书向党委递来，一张张的大字报贴满了车站的墙壁。
    为了动员机关、企业、工厂、学校的职工学生，把假期穿插错开，免得大家挤在一起走，车辆转不过来，站长亲自出马，挨门穿户调查旅客的流量、流向、流时，以便集中售票，分批疏运。汽车站的窗口昼夜敞着，什么时候都可以买到票，不必站队等很长时间。
    他们想，春节回家的客人携老扶幼，还带着一大堆行李，要是来车站上车，大冷天该多不方便。要把车子开到旅客较集中的地点，既免了旅客的麻烦，还能节省一点小搬运费。
    大跃进、大建设，家乡大变了样。客人下车要是摸黑走，会不会迷了路？调度室的同志为这事研究了每条路线的发车到车时间，为的是要让旅客早到一会，便于寻路问道，也好早点看看家乡的新面貌。
    客人回家过节不要带点“年货”吗？又有人想出了好主意：在客车的屁股上带个挂车，专办零担运输，定受旅客欢迎。
              ×　　　　　×　　　　　×
    亲爱的读者，当您读到这篇片片断断的通讯时，也许您已经登上回乡的路程；也许您阁家欢乐正在谈说大跃进中的小故事；也许您正在从零售店里刚刚买到新鲜的果品蔬菜……每当这时，您能不从内心里感激那些为我们日夜辛苦的运输工人吗！　　　（连祥）
