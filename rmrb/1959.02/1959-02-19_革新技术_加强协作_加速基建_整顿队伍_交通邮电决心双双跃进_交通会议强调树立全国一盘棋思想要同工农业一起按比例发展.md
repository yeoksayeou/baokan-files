Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The grand 1959 national economic leap forward plan brings even more arduous tasks to transportation, postal and telecommunications. It is estimated that the total national freight volume this year will increase by more than double compared to 1958, and the volume of postal and telecommunications services will also increase significantly. The basic construction tasks of the transportation departments are also greater than in any previous year. In order to complete and overfulfill this year's tasks, the CPC Central Committee Transportation Work Department and the Ministry of Transport recently held the National Provincial, Municipal, and Autonomous Region Party Committee Transportation Work Ministers Conference and the National Transportation Work Conference, respectively, for discussions. After deeply studying the current situation of transportation and communications work, both conferences believe that in order to complete this year's arduous tasks, the staff and workers of the national transportation, postal, and telecommunications departments must continue to exert great effort, strive for the upstream, hold high the red flag, and launch a mass movement for vigorously developing transportation under centralized leadership, so as to promote greater leaps forward in transportation, postal, and telecommunications.

In order to ensure the completion of this year's transportation, postal and telecommunications tasks, both conferences believe that the following tasks must be grasped:

	(1) Vigorously carry out the technical revolution movement. In accordance with the urgent needs of production and the requirement to gradually eliminate heavy manual labor, we should formulate a technical revolution plan to achieve mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. While continuing to mobilize the masses to engage in invention and creation, we must select, test, finalize, and vigorously promote existing inventions and creations. We must implement the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and gradually improve. Departments and enterprises with the necessary conditions should pay attention to scientific research work. We must universally mobilize the masses and implement the "three-way combination of leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers," organize all forces, and focus on solving key problems in production.

	(2) Strengthen transportation organization work, improve the planning nature of transportation, and do a good job in transportation collaboration. We must strengthen the work of the Transportation Committee and the Transportation Command. It can promptly organize the comprehensive utilization of various transportation tools; promptly organize the balance between transportation capacity and transportation volume; organize transportation collaboration among various departments, and implement planned transportation and rational transportation.

	(3) Strengthen transportation and postal construction work. The manufacturing and repair plants of the railway, transportation, and postal systems must guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of tool manufacturing, repair, and other production tasks, and strive to develop the transportation industry, vigorously run various factories, and arm themselves. We must mobilize the masses, and according to national and local plans, ensure the timely completion of the construction of railways, highways, waterways, ports, stations, and communication equipment, and pay attention to the maintenance and repair of existing roads and equipment. In transportation and postal construction, we must not only develop foreign equipment and foreign tools, but also develop indigenous equipment and indigenous tools. In areas with poor transportation conditions, we should pay special attention to using local materials and massively developing civilian transportation tools. We must fully implement the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, fully tap potential, and complete more production and construction tasks with less investment. Special attention should be paid to quality and saving raw materials. In order to coordinate the development of all aspects of transportation construction, we must pay attention to overall planning, so that transportation is "complete" and "networked." Lines, ports, stations, equipment, tools, and repair forces must be developed in a coordinated manner, and trunk lines, branch lines, waterways, land routes, foreign railways, and indigenous railways must be connected.

	(4) Consolidate, strengthen, and improve the mass transportation and postal teams. We must establish professional transportation teams and reserve teams in counties, communes, factories, mines, and urban streets as needed, and often pay attention to arranging them to undertake transportation and infrastructure tasks; rural postal and telecommunications institutions below the county level that have not yet been decentralized should be decentralized, and the people's communes should manage the decentralized postal and telecommunications institutions well, and should be reorganized according to business needs and the principle of streamlining. We must strengthen the management of these transportation and postal teams, establish necessary working systems, and strengthen political and ideological work to gradually improve them.

Both conferences unanimously emphasized that in completing this year's heavy transportation tasks, we must establish the idea of "the whole country as a single chess game." The national economic construction plan with steel as the key link is a big chess game. In this chess game, the transportation industry is also a chess game. In terms of the transportation industry, railway, highway, waterway, and civil aviation transportation are all components of this chess game, and they must be comprehensively utilized, fully collaborated, and unifiedly commanded. Strengthening the idea of the whole country as a single chess game means strengthening the idea of striving to complete the country's unified transportation tasks. All partial interests must be subordinate to the overall interests. When arranging transportation, all localities must implement the principle of ensuring the central government, taking care of local areas, ensuring key points, and taking care of general needs.

The meeting convened by the Transportation Work Department of the CPC Central Committee pointed out that while planning and deploying industrial and agricultural production in their respective regions, party committees at all levels must make overall considerations and comprehensive arrangements for the transportation industry (including postal and telecommunications), so that the transportation industry can develop in a planned and proportionate manner together with the entire industrial and agricultural production, so as to ensure the needs of national economic development. This meeting also discussed and studied how to give play to the party's leading role in transportation enterprises, fully promote the mass line working methods of "two participations, one reform, three combinations, and four big," carry out socialist and communist education, cultivate a transportation team that is both red and expert, and some issues related to the transportation system.

    革新技术  加强协作  加速基建  整顿队伍
    交通邮电决心双双跃进
    交通会议强调树立全国一盘棋思想要同工农业一起按比例发展
    据新华社18日讯　1959年宏伟的国民经济跃进计划，给交通运输、邮电事业带来更加繁重的任务。预计今年全国货运总量将比1958年增长一倍以上，邮电业务量也将有很大的增加，交通部门的基本建设任务，也比以往任何一年大得多。如何完成和超额完成今年的任务，最近中共中央交通工作部和交通部召开的全国省、市、自治区党委交通工作部长会议和全国交通工作会议分别作了讨论。两个会议在深入研究当前交通运输和通讯工作的形势后，认为要完成今年的繁重任务，全国交通运输、邮电部门的职工，必须继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，高举红旗，在集中领导之下开展大办交通的群众运动，促使交通邮电事业获得更大的跃进。
    为了保证今年交通运输、邮电任务的完成，两个会议都认为必须抓以下几项工作：
    （一）大力开展技术革命运动。要根据生产的迫切需要和逐步消灭笨重体力劳动的要求，订出实现机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化的技术革命规划。要在继续发动群众搞发明创造的同时，把已有的发明创造加以选择、试验、定型、大力推广。要贯彻执行土洋结合、逐步提高的方针。有条件的部门和企业要注意科学研究工作。要普遍发动群众，实行“领导干部、技术人员和工人三结合”，把各种力量组织起来，集中解决生产中的关键问题。
    （二）加强运输组织工作，提高运输的计划性，搞好运输协作。要加强运输委员会和运输指挥部的工作。它可以及时组织各种运输工具的综合利用；及时组织运力和运量之间的平衡；组织各个部门的运输协作，实行计划运输和合理运输。
      （三）加强交通、邮电的建设工作。铁道、交通、邮电系统的制造厂和修配厂，要保证完成和超额完成工具制造、修配和其他生产任务，尽量发展交通工业，大办各种工厂，自己武装自己。要发动群众，根据国家和各地的计划，保证按期完成铁路、公路、航道、港口、车站和通信设备的修建任务，并注意做好现有道路、设备的养护维修工作。在交通、邮电建设上，不仅要发展洋设备、洋工具，也要发展土设备、土工具，在交通条件较差的地区，特别要注意就地取材，大量发展民间运输工具。必须全面贯彻多快好省的方针，要充分挖掘潜力，以较少的投资，完成更多的生产和建设任务。特别要注意质量和节约原材料。为了使交通建设的各个环节协调地发展，必须注意全面规划，使交通“成套”“成网”，线路、港、站、设备、工具、修配力量要协调发展，干线、支线、水路、陆路、洋铁路、土铁路要沟通衔接。
    （四）整顿巩固和提高群众性的交通、邮电队伍。要根据需要把县、公社、厂矿、城市街道的专业运输队伍和后备队伍建立起来，并经常注意安排他们担负运输和基建的任务；县以下的农村邮电机构，还没有下放的要下放，人民公社对下放的邮电机构要很好的管起来，并要根据业务需要和精简原则加以整理。对于这些运输、邮电队伍，要加强管理，建立必要的工作制度，加强政治思想工作，使它逐步提高。
    两个会议一致强调在完成今年繁重的运输任务中，要树立“全国一盘棋”的思想。以钢为纲的全国经济建设计划是一盘大棋。在这盘大棋中，交通运输业也是一盘棋。就交通运输业来说，铁路、公路、水路和民用航空的运输都是这盘棋的组成部分，它们必须综合利用，全面协作和统一指挥。加强一盘棋的思想即加强为完成国家统一的运输任务而奋斗的思想。一切局部利益都必须服从整体利益。各个地方在安排运输的时候，一定要贯彻保证中央、照顾地方，保证重点、照顾一般的原则。
    中共中央交通工作部召开的会议指出各级党委在对本地区工农业生产进行规划和部署的同时，一定要对交通运输业（包括邮电事业），作通盘考虑和全面安排，使交通运输事业能够同整个工农业生产一起有计划、按比例地发展，以保证国民经济发展的需要。这个会议还讨论和研究了如何发挥党在交通企业中的领导作用，全面推广“两参、一改、三结合、四大”的群众路线工作方法，开展社会主义和共产主义教育，培养一支又红又专的交通运输队伍以及有关交通体制方面的一些问题。
