To further implement the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently, in conjunction with the 1958 basic construction inter-factory competition evaluation, mobilized the masses to summarize their experiences in comprehensively implementing the policy of greater, faster, better, and more economical results. It also held a basic construction conference to promote the experiences of the Shanxi Provincial Sixth Construction Engineering Company and the Taiyuan Municipal Engineering Company.

At a meeting attended by leading cadres such as party committee secretaries and managers of various basic construction units, the Municipal Committee analyzed the characteristics of this year's basic construction: heavy tasks and many new workers. Therefore, it is necessary to pay special attention to project quality and safety. The Municipal Committee requested all units to take measures in design, construction, and worker training to ensure quality and safety: (1) When improving design and selecting engineering structures, attention must be paid to ensuring project quality. If it is necessary to simplify design and engineering structures, it is necessary to first survey the terrain and geology and conduct experiments, and only after proving that there is a scientific basis can it be promoted. (2) Do a good job in construction preparation. For high-altitude operations, scaffolding and safety nets must be prepared. Construction sites should be orderly. (3) Strengthen the education of employees on the comprehensive implementation of the policy of greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Through employees' airing of views, new operating procedures suitable for production needs should be formulated.

In recent days, all construction engineering units in the city have launched a mass quality and safety inspection campaign and formulated measures to prevent major quality and safety accidents. Many units have adopted a method that combines inspections by leading cadres and technical personnel with the airing of views by workers, and any loopholes in quality or safety are improved in a timely manner. The Shanxi Provincial Sixth Construction Engineering Company formed a quality and safety inspection team headed by the company's deputy manager and chief engineer to conduct a comprehensive review and inspection of geological data, important designs, and the strength of various materials. Immediate recalculations were made where necessary, and repairs were made immediately where necessary. After the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company's power station installation site's workers were mobilized by the party committee, they posted more than 200 big-character posters in a few days. The workers examined their negligent thinking on quality and safety and put forward ways to prevent it. Workers at the Taiyuan Chemical Engineering Department's construction site checked out 18 fire prevention loopholes, such as smoking casually in sheds, and carried out discussions on the relationship between eliminating accidents and accelerating project progress. These loopholes were quickly plugged.

    项项工程多快好省
    太原建筑单位开展质量、安全检查运动
    本报太原3日电　为了进一步全面贯彻多快好省的建设方针，最近中共太原市委结合1958年基本建设厂际竞赛评比工作，发动群众总结了全面贯彻多快好省方针的经验，并且召开基本建设会议，推广了山西省第六建筑工程公司和太原市政工程公司的经验。
    市委在各基本建设单位党委书记、经理等负责干部参加的会议上，分析了今年基本建设的特点是，任务繁重，新工人多。因此，需要特别重视工程质量和安全。市委要求各单位进一步从设计、施工和培训工人等方面采取措施，保证质量和安全：（一）改进设计和选择工程结构时，必须注意保证工程质量。如果要简化设计和工程结构，需要先勘测地形、地质，并且经过试验，证明有科学根据才能推行。（二）作好施工准备工作。高空作业，必须备妥脚手架、安全网。要使施工现场有条不紊。（三）对职工加强全面贯彻多快好省方针的教育。通过职工鸣放，制订出适合生产需要的新的操作规程。
    近日来，全市各个建筑工程单位开展了群众性的质量、安全检查运动，制定了一些杜绝重大质量、安全事故的措施。许多单位采取领导干部、技术人员检查同工人大鸣大放相结合的办法，发现有质量或安全事故的漏洞就及时改进。山西省第六建筑工程公司由公司副经理、主任工程师为首组成了质量、安全检查组，对地质资料、重要设计和各种材料的强度等，进行了全面的审查和检验。发现需要复算的立即复算，需要补修的立即进行了补修。太原钢铁公司电站安装工地职工在党委动员以后，几天内就贴出二百多张大字报。职工们检查了对待质量、安全的麻痹思想，提出了防止的办法。太原化工工程处工地的职工检查出在席棚里随便吸烟等十八项防火漏洞，开展了杜绝事故同加速工程进度关系的讨论，这些漏洞很快就堵住了。
