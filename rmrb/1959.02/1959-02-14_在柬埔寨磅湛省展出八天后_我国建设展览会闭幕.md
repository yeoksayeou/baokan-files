Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, February 13th: China's Construction Exhibition concluded on the evening of February 10th after an eight-day run in Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia.

    The exhibition received approximately 200,000 visitors from Kampong Cham, Kratie, Kampong Thom, Pursat, Siem Reap, and Prey Veng provinces.

    Visitors wrote many comments in the guestbook, enthusiastically praising the growing friendship between China and Cambodia. The Governor of Kampong Cham Province, Ouk You Ann, wrote that the Chinese exhibition was beneficial to the Cambodian people because they would absorb the experiences created by the Chinese people and adapt them to the Cambodian situation. The official delegation from Siem Reap Province wrote that China's methods of cultivation and agricultural implements for obtaining bumper harvests were easy to learn. The Cambodian people will apply these methods.

    Another visitor wrote that after visiting this exhibition, it is clear that the friendship between Cambodia and China is based on mutual assistance to achieve common prosperity, and not on military affairs and weapons, as the imperialists have spread rumors. Although our political systems are different, we have the same lofty ideals for developing industry and agriculture.

    During the exhibition, Gu Fusheng, Acting Head of the Chinese Delegation, and other personnel, accompanied by the Governor of Kampong Cham Province and other senior officials, visited the province's agricultural experimental station, cotton experimental station, and other facilities. The Chinese guests exchanged experiences on the spot with the relevant Cambodian personnel.

    在柬埔寨磅湛省展出八天后
    我国建设展览会闭幕
    新华社金边13日电　中国建设展览会在柬埔寨磅湛省展出了八天以后，已在10日晚上闭幕。
    展览会接待了约二十万观众，他们来自磅湛、桔井、磅同、菩萨、暹粒和波萝勉等省。
    来宾们在意见簿上写下了许多观感，热情地赞扬了日益发展着的中柬友谊。磅湛省省长奥金安写道，中国展览会对柬埔寨人民是有益的，因为他们将吸收中国人民创造的那些经验，并且使它们适合于柬埔寨的情况。暹粒省的官方代表团写道，中国获得丰收的耕作方法和农具是容易学的。柬埔寨人民将运用这些方法。
    另一位参观者写道，参观了这个展览会以后可以清楚地看出，柬中友谊是建立在为达到共同繁荣的互助基础上的，而不是像帝国主义者谣言所说的建立在军事和武器的基础上的。虽然我们的政治制度不同，可是我们发展工农业的崇高理想是一样的。
    在这个展览会展出期间，中国代表团代理团长顾福生和其它人员在磅湛省省长和其他高级官员的陪同下，参观了省的农业实验站、棉花实验站和其它设施。中国客人同柬埔寨有关人员就地交换了经验。
