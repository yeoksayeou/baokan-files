    The Effect of Watering Wheat

    Henan People's Victory Canal Irrigation Area experiment: Wheat that was watered had a ground temperature increase of one degree, and the plant height increased by 12.1 cm; wheat that was not watered had a plant height of 9.7 cm. Wheat that was watered had an 18% increase in tillering rate and a 93% increase in tillering roots compared to wheat that was not watered. A survey in Hua County showed that wheat that was only fertilized but not watered had 14 tillers; wheat that was neither watered nor fertilized had only 5 tillers; wheat that was fertilized and watered had as many as 21 tillers.

    An investigation in Anyang: In wheat test fields that were watered twice, there were 465 tillers per 100 plants; in wheat that was watered once, there were 426 tillers per 100 plants; and in wheat that was not watered, there were only 397 tillers per 100 plants. In general wheat fields, watered wheat had 350 tillers per 100 plants; unwatered wheat had only 280 tillers. (Jun Qian)

    小麦浇水效果
    河南人民胜利渠灌区试验：小麦浇了水的，地温升高一度，株高一二点一公分；不浇水的，株高九点七公分。浇了水的比不浇水的分蘖率增加18％，分蘖根增加93％。滑县调查：小麦只追肥不浇水的，分蘖十四个头；不浇水又不追肥的，分蘖只五个头；施了追肥又浇了水的，分蘖达二十一个头。
    安阳调查：浇过两次水的小麦试验田，每百株分蘖四百六十五个头；浇一水的每百株分蘖四百二十六个头；不浇水的，每百株只分蘖三百九十七个头。一般麦田，浇水的每百株分蘖三百五十个头；不浇水的，只有二百八十个头。　（君谦）
