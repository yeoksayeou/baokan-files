Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 11th: The Council of the "European Economic Cooperation Organization" recently published the final settlement results of the "European Payments Union," which collapsed at the end of last year. The settlement results show that West Germany is the largest creditor in this "Payments Union," and the other sixteen member states are in debt to it; among them, the United Kingdom owes West Germany $269.7 million, and France also owes West Germany $167.4 million.

The settlement results also show that France is the largest debtor in this "Payments Union." In addition to the huge debt owed to West Germany, France also owes a total of $484.5 million to the other fourteen member states, excluding Ireland.

The "European Payments Union" was established in July 1950 by seventeen Western European countries that received so-called "Marshall Aid" as an institution for settling trade surpluses and deficits among themselves. The rise and fall of the creditor and debtor status of major countries in the "Payments Union" reflects the fierce competition for markets among them. Furthermore, the official entry into force of the so-called "Common Market" of the six Western European countries on New Year's Day this year has further intensified the contradictions between the monopoly groups of major Western European countries. The Western European "Payments Union," which lasted for nearly eight years, finally collapsed at the end of last year amidst a major scramble manifested in the declaration of free currency convertibility by major Western European countries, and was replaced by a so-called "European Monetary Agreement."

    西欧“支付同盟”算出总账
    西德成为最大债主
    新华社11日讯　巴黎消息：“欧洲经济合作局”理事会不久前发表了关于在去年年底宣告垮台的“欧洲支付同盟”的最后结算结果。结算结果表明，西德是这个“支付同盟”中最大的债主，其他十六个成员国都对它负有债务；其中英国欠西德二亿六千九百七十万美元，法国也欠西德一亿六千七百四十万美元。
    结算结果还表明，法国是这个“支付同盟”中最大的债务国。除了欠西德的巨额债务外，法国还对除了爱尔兰之外的其余十四个成员国欠有总额达四亿八千四百五十万美元的债务。
    “欧洲支付同盟”是在1950年7月由接受所谓“马歇尔援助”的十七个西欧国家建立起来作为结算它们彼此之间贸易盈亏的机构。“支付同盟”中各主要国家债权和债务地位的消长反映了它们之间争夺市场竞争的剧烈。而由于所谓西欧六国“共同市场”定今年元旦正式生效，更使西欧各主要国家垄断集团间的矛盾进一步激化。成立近八年的西欧“支付同盟”终于在去年年底以西欧各主要国家货币宣布自由兑换为形式表现出来的大混战中宣告垮台，而被一个所谓“欧洲货币协定”所代替。
