    “Managing Wheat Like Embroidery”
    Cheng Pu
    Farmers in Yangzhong County, Jiangsu Province, are launching a large-scale mass movement to manage wheat fields with the spirit of "managing wheat like embroidery," striving for a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin of wheat this year (the county's average per-mu yield of three wheat crops last year was 251.5 jin).
    "Managing wheat like embroidery" is a very interesting slogan. Everyone knows how delicate embroidery is. To embroider exquisitely and beautifully, women must concentrate and meticulously use the needle and thread. Now, people dare to use this spirit to manage large areas of wheat fields. This is no simple matter! We often say "brocade-like rivers and mountains," which only describes our motherland's rivers and mountains as beautiful as brocade, but the people of Yangzhong County are truly weaving and embroidering the land of the motherland with their own hands! They want to carry out a large-scale high-yield movement with the meticulousness of embroidery. The comrades in Yangzhong County are not just talking about this casually. They are doing it practically and doing it very well. After completing the sowing of more than 100,000 mu of wheat last autumn, the county immediately launched a wheat field processing campaign, basically achieving garden-like management in every plot of wheat field. At the beginning of January, they overcame the cold wave, preventing frost damage to the wheat fields. People also applied a large amount of topdressing fertilizer to the wheat fields. Not long ago, the Yangzhong County Party Committee decided to mobilize the masses to break through the "five barriers" (overwintering, greening, round stem elongation, booting and heading, maturity) of three wheat production, "tightening every link" to ensure high yields in every plot of wheat field. We believe that as long as this tenacious and meticulous spirit is used to manage the wheat fields to the end, they will be able to break through all barriers and finally win the red flag of high-yield three wheat crops.
    We are pleased to see that Yangzhong County is not the only place managing wheat fields meticulously with the spirit of embroidery; in fact, many places are doing this now. Examples can be readily found. According to a report in the Hebei Daily on the 16th of this month, Cang County, Hebei Province, recently launched a high tide of wheat field management under the slogan "Work hard for 100 days to ensure the realization of a 1,000-jin county" and launched a competition with ten counties and cities, including Anguo and Gaocheng. Now that wheat is about to begin to green up, the Cang County Party Committee has decided to focus on water and fertilizer to ensure that the wheat passes the greening stage well and achieves "four increases": increased plants, increased ears, increased grains, and increased grain weight. The measures are: vigorously conserve soil moisture before greening, irrigate greening water, vigorously apply topdressing fertilizer, and prevent and control diseases and insect pests. Currently, farmers throughout the county are rushing to deliver fertilizer, apply topdressing, and irrigate wheat.
    On the one hand, holding high advanced production increase targets, and on the other hand, tightly grasping advanced production increase measures, "finely carving and meticulously grinding" in specific field management, advancing steadily step by step until the final victory. This is a manifestation of strategically despising difficulties and tactically valuing difficulties, a combination of revolutionary drive and a pragmatic spirit. To do something, no matter how complex and difficult it is, if we can use meticulous and detailed scientific analysis, dissect it into several parts according to the internal connections of the matter, and then take a series of meticulous measures to complete each part one by one, then we will be confident in successfully completing the entire matter. It can be seen that the more we value difficulties tactically, the more reason and confidence we have to despise difficulties strategically. This is also the case in agricultural production. To increase the average per-mu yield of wheat from 200-300 jin to 1,000 jin at once cannot be said to be a difficult task. However, if we can use a meticulous and detailed scientific attitude to analyze all the factors that determine that wheat yield may reach more than 1,000 jin, dissect the entire production process of wheat from sowing to maturity into several "barriers," and then take a series of meticulous measures to break through each "barrier," then, in such a thorough and detailed practical process, people's confidence in successfully completing the arduous task of 1,000 jin per mu will continue to increase.
    Of course, managing wheat fields meticulously with the spirit of embroidery will cost a lot of effort and entail a lot of trouble. But this is only one side of the matter; the other side is that people will be able to control the growth pattern of wheat to a greater extent. This is because meticulousness leads to familiarity, familiarity leads to skill, and the more skillful, the more freedom. A diligent embroidery expert can flexibly and freely embroider more and more exquisite flowers through continuous and careful operation. In wheat field management, if we put in the effort as meticulous as embroidery, we will surely be able to discover and master the objective laws of production more comprehensively and deeply. Using these objective laws to fight against nature, people's freedom will become more and more abundant. We wish Yangzhong County, Cang County, and all places that are meticulously cultivating wheat can "embroider" the most beautiful flowers in the vast wheat fields.

    “管麦如绣花”
    程浦
    江苏省扬中县的农民正在开展一个大规模的群众运动，要以“管麦如绣花”的精神，对麦田进行精细的加工管理，力争今年全县麦子亩产千斤（去年全县三麦平均亩产量是二百五十一斤半）。
    “管麦如绣花”，这个口号很有意思。谁都知道，绣花是多么精细的女红，妇女绣花，要想绣得精致、美丽，必须专心致志、一丝不苟地运针使线才行。现在，人们敢于用这样的精神来管理大面积的麦田，这是多么不简单的事！我们常说“锦绣河山”，这只不过是形容我们祖国的河山美丽得像锦绣一样，可是，扬中县的人们真是在用自己的双手织绣着祖国的大地！他们要以绣花的细致程度开展大面积丰产运动。扬中县的同志们并不是随随便便说说这句话的，他们正在脚踏实地地这样做，而且做得很出色。这个县在去年秋季完成十万多亩麦子的播种工作以后，立即开展了麦田突击加工运动，使块块麦田基本上达到了园田化。1月初，战胜了寒流，使麦田避免了冻害。人们又给麦田施了大量的追肥。不久前，中共扬中县委又决定发动群众再闯三麦生产的“五关”（越冬、返青、圆秆拔节、孕穗抽穗、成熟），“环环措施都抓紧”，确保块块麦田都高产。我们相信，只要用这种顽强、细致的精神把麦田管理抓到底，他们一定能闯过一切关口，最后夺得三麦高产的红旗。
    我们高兴地看到，用绣花的精神来精细地管理麦田的，不只有扬中县一个地方；实际上许多地方目前也正在这样做。例子随手可以拈到。据本月16日河北日报报道，河北省沧县最近在“大干鏖战一百天，保证实现千斤县”的口号下，掀起了麦田管理高潮，并且同安国、藁城等十个县市展开了竞赛。现在小麦就要开始返青，沧县县委决定大抓水肥，保证小麦过好返青关，实现“四增”：增株、增穗、增粒、增粒重。措施是：在返青前大力保墒，浇返青水，大力追肥，防治病虫害。目前全县农民正在突击送肥、追肥、浇麦。
    一方面高高举起先进的增产指标，一方面紧紧抓住先进的增产措施，在具体的田间管理上“精雕细刻”，稳扎稳打，一关又一关地向前推进，直到最后胜利。这是在战略上藐视困难而又在战术上重视困难的表现，是革命干劲和求实精神相结合的表现。办一件事情，不管它多么复杂和困难，假如能运用周密细致的科学分析，按照这件事情的内在联系把它解剖成若干个部分，然后再采取一系列的细致的措施去逐一完成每一个部分。这样一来，就有把握胜利完成这件事情的全部。可见，越是能在战术上重视困难，就越有理由和信心在战略上藐视困难。在农业生产上也是这样。使麦子的平均亩产量由二、三百斤一下子跃增到一千斤，这不能不说是个艰巨的任务。但是假如能够用周密细致的科学态度，分析决定麦子产量可能达到千斤以上的一切因素，把麦子从播种到成熟的整个生产过程解剖成若干个“关口”，然后采取一系列的细致的措施来突破每一个“关口”，那么，在这样周密细致的具体实践过程中，人们对于完成亩产千斤的艰巨任务的胜利信心就会不断地增强。
    当然，用绣花的精神去细致地管理麦田，要耗费许多心机，要承受许多麻烦。但是这只是事情的一面；另一面却是人越来越能在更大的程度上驾驭麦子的生长规律。这是因为细能生熟，熟能生巧，愈巧愈自由。一个勤勉的刺绣能手，由于不断地细心地操作，能够灵活自如地绣出越来越精美的花。在麦田管理上，如果下了细如绣花的功夫，也一定能更全面更深入地发现和掌握生产的客观规律。运用这种客观规律去跟自然作斗争，人们的自由就愈来愈多。祝扬中县、沧县和一切正在精益求精地培育麦子的地方都能在广阔的麦田上“绣”出最美丽的花来。
