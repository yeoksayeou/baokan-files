Xinhua News Agency, February 21st: Premier Phạm Văn Đồng of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam wrote to Premier Zhou Enlai on January 30th regarding the current situation of the 50,000 Vietnamese nationals in Thailand. Premier Zhou Enlai replied to Premier Phạm Văn Đồng on February 19th, expressing the Chinese government's full support for the proposals put forward by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on this issue. The correspondence between Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier Phạm Văn Đồng is as follows:

  Premier Zhou Enlai's reply to Comrade Phạm Văn Đồng, Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam:

    I have received your letter of January 30, 1959. The Chinese government and the Chinese people deeply sympathize with the plight of the 50,000 Vietnamese nationals in Thailand and express great regret at the Thai authorities' unreasonable persecution of Vietnamese nationals.

    The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's request that the Thai authorities immediately cease the persecution of overseas Vietnamese and its proposal that the Red Cross societies of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Thailand make contact and consultations as soon as possible to resolve issues such as the residence and repatriation to Vietnam of overseas Vietnamese is entirely reasonable. The Chinese government fully supports this reasonable proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    The Chinese government has always maintained that the settlement of international disputes should be guided by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and that disputes between countries should be resolved through peaceful consultation. Therefore, the issue of Vietnamese nationals existing between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Thailand can and should be resolved through peaceful consultation. The Thai authorities' unwillingness to negotiate not only hinders the improvement of Thai-Vietnamese relations and is detrimental to Vietnamese nationals residing in Thailand, but is also detrimental to the Thai people. We hope that the Thai authorities will, in the spirit of the Bandung Conference and the desire of the peoples of Asia and Africa for unity and friendship, stop persecuting Vietnamese nationals and reasonably handle the issue of repatriation to Vietnam.

    Just as is the case with the plight of Vietnamese nationals in Thailand, overseas Chinese in Thailand are also being subjected to similar persecution by the Thai authorities. All of this is inseparable from the American conspiracy to undermine relations between Thailand and the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The government of the People's Republic of China naturally cannot but be concerned about the plight of Chinese nationals in Thailand.

    Premier Comrade, I believe that your proposal will not only receive the sympathy and support of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, but will also receive the sympathy and support of all other peace-loving and justice-upholding countries and peoples. Justice is on the side of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Vietnamese nationals in Thailand should receive proper treatment, and their repatriation to Vietnam should be reasonably resolved.

    Please accept my highest respects.
      Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China

  Letter from Phạm Văn Đồng, Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam:

  Dear Premier Comrade:

    I would like to draw your attention to the current situation of the 50,000 Vietnamese nationals in Thailand.

    Our Vietnamese nationals in Thailand moved to Thailand in 1946 to escape the ravages of war in Laos and Cambodia. They were granted residence by the former Thai government and received sympathy and help from all walks of life in Thailand. For more than a decade, they have made an honest living and have always respected the laws and customs of their place of residence. They have made no small contribution to Thailand's economy.

    After the end of the Indochina War, most of our nationals wanted to return to their homeland to contribute their share to the construction of their country. At the Bandung Conference in 1955, I met with Thai Foreign Minister Prince Wan Waithayakon, and the two sides exchanged preliminary views and reached an agreement in principle that the two countries should consult on resolving the issue of Vietnamese repatriation. Subsequently, the governments of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Thailand exchanged notes requesting the Republic of India to act as an intermediary in order to prepare for negotiations on the issue of Vietnamese repatriation. However, despite the repeated expression by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam of its goodwill to resolve the issue of Vietnamese repatriation in the spirit of respecting human rights and the legitimate rights of Vietnamese nationals, this work has been delayed and no results have been achieved because the Thai government is unwilling to respond to the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's proposal for a meeting and consultation between the two sides.

    In June 1958, after being informed by the Consul General of the Republic of India in Hanoi that the Thai government had proposed that the Red Cross societies of Vietnam and Thailand discuss the issue of Vietnamese repatriation, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam appointed the Red Cross Society of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to contact the Thai Red Cross Society. The Red Cross Society of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly suggested that the Thai Red Cross Society propose the time, place and composition of the delegation for negotiations. However, due to the obstruction of the Thai government, no contact has been possible so far.

    Since the end of October 1958, the Thai authorities have ordered the arrest and imprisonment of more than 500 Vietnamese nationals, putting their lives, property and reputations in serious jeopardy. Recently, there have been reports that the Thai authorities intend to concentrate 50,000 Vietnamese nationals in southern Thailand, and intend to hand over 200 of the Vietnamese nationals arrested by the Thai authorities in November 1958 to the South Vietnamese regime.

    The above actions and attempts by the Thai authorities violate international law, the Charter of the United Nations, the Declaration of Human Rights, and the spirit of the Bandung Conference of 1955. This attempt completely disregards the wishes of the Vietnamese nationals and harms the friendship between the Vietnamese and Thai nations.

    The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has written to the Thai government expressing its opposition to all actions by the Thai authorities that harm the lives, property and reputations of our nationals, as well as the forced relocation of them to South Vietnam or the concentration of Vietnamese nationals in southern Thailand against their wishes. At present, Vietnam is temporarily divided into two regions, and Vietnamese nationals are completely free to choose which region they wish to return to. This legitimate right of Vietnamese nationals must be respected, and the Thai authorities must not force them to move to South Vietnam against their wishes.

    Regarding the arrested Vietnamese nationals, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has requested that the Thai government restore their freedom, as they have not violated Thai law. And asked the Thai government to arrange for their repatriation in accordance with the wishes of the Vietnamese nationals. On the side of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is always ready to welcome its own nationals back home.

    Regarding the entire issue of Vietnamese repatriation, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that it is necessary for the governments of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Thailand to appoint the Red Cross Societies of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Thailand to make contact to discuss various related matters, such as guaranteeing the safety of Vietnamese nationals, handling their property, and arranging for their repatriation. The venue for negotiations can be chosen by Thailand, either in Thailand, in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, or in a third country.

    In the spirit of solidarity and mutual assistance among the peoples of Asia and Africa, and in the spirit of the Bandung Conference, I hope that the People's Republic of China will support our government's request that Thailand must immediately stop suppressing and imprisoning Vietnamese nationals, restore the freedom of those arrested, and begin contact and consultations between the Red Cross Societies of Vietnam and Thailand as soon as possible in order to resolve the issue of Vietnamese repatriation.

    With kindest regards.

    周总理就旅泰越侨问题函复范文同总理
    中国政府完全支持越南政府建议
    希望泰国当局停止迫害旅泰越侨
    旅泰华侨也遭到迫害，中国政府关心侨胞处境
    新华社21日讯　越南民主共和国范文同总理1月30日曾就在泰国的五万越南侨民的现状写信给周恩来总理。周恩来总理2月19日复信范文同总理，表示中国政府完全支持越南民主共和国政府就这一问题提出的建议。周恩来总理和范文同总理的来往信件如下：
  周恩来总理的复信越南民主共和国总理范文同同志：
    我收到了您1959年1月30日的来信。中国政府和中国人民深切同情在泰国的五万越南侨民的处境，对泰国当局无理迫害越南侨民的行为感到极大的遗憾。
    越南民主共和国政府要求泰国当局立即停止对越侨的迫害，并且建议越南民主共和国和泰国两国红十字会尽早接触和商谈，以便解决越侨的居留和归国等问题，这是完全合理的。中国政府完全支持越南民主共和国政府的这个合理的建议。
    中国政府一贯认为，解决国际争端应该以和平共处的五项原则为准则，国与国之间的纠纷应该通过和平协商求得解决。因此，存在于越南民主共和国和泰国之间的越南侨民问题，是可以而且应当通过和平协商的方式得到解决的。泰国当局不愿协商的态度，不仅妨碍泰越两国关系的改善，不利于旅居在泰国的越南侨民，而且对于泰国人民也是不利的。我们希望泰国当局能本着万隆会议的精神和亚非各国人民要求团结友好的愿望，停止对越南侨民的迫害，合理地处理越侨的归国问题。
    正如旅泰越侨的处境一样，旅泰华侨也遭到泰国当局类似的迫害。所有这一切，都是同美国阴谋破坏泰国和中华人民共和国、越南民主共和国之间的关系分不开的。中华人民共和国政府自然也不能不关心中国旅泰侨胞的处境。
    总理同志，我相信，您的建议不但得到中国政府和中国人民的同情和支持，而且也会得到其他一切爱好和平、主持正义的国家和人民的同情和支持。正义在越南民主共和国方面，越南旅泰侨民应该得到正当的待遇，他们的归国问题应该得到合理的解决。
    请接受我最崇高的敬意。
      中华人民共和国国务院总理
                周恩来（签名）
          1959年2月19日于北京
  越南民主共和国
  范文同总理的来信亲爱的总理同志：
    我谨请您关注我国旅泰五万侨胞的现状。
    我国旅泰侨胞是在1946年为了逃避在老挝、柬埔寨的战争灾难而迁往泰国的，他们曾经获得前泰国政府准予居留，并且得到泰国各阶层人民的同情和帮助。十多年来，他们善良谋生，一向尊重住在地的法律和风俗习惯。他们对泰国的经济领域曾作出了不小的贡献。
    印度支那战争结束以后，我们的侨胞大多数都想回到家乡为祖国的建设事业贡献他们的一分力量。在1955年万隆会议时，我曾会见泰国外交部长旺·威泰耶康亲王，双方初步交换了意见并且原则上达成了关于两国应该就解决越侨归国问题进行协商的协议。其后，越南民主共和国政府和泰国政府曾经互换照会请印度共和国作中间人，以便为越侨归国问题谈判作好准备。但是，尽管越南民主共和国政府曾多次表明希望根据尊重人权和越侨的正当权利的精神来解决越侨归国问题的善意，然而这一工作仍被拖延，未能获致结果，因为泰国政府不愿意答复越南民主共和国政府关于双方会晤和协商的建议。
    至1958年6月，在得到印度共和国驻河内总领事先生告知泰国政府提出交由越南和泰国两个红十字会来商谈越侨归国问题的建议之后，越南民主共和国政府即委派越南民主共和国红十字会同泰国红十字会进行接触。越南民主共和国红十字会曾经多次建议泰国红十字会提出谈判的时间、地点和代表团的成分。但是由于泰国政府的阻挠，至今还没有能够进行接触。
    自1958年10月底以来，泰国当局下令逮捕和监禁了五百多名越侨，使得他们的生命、财产和名誉遭受到严重的威胁。最近，又有消息传来泰国当局打算把五万越侨集中到泰国南部，并且打算将1958年11月间被泰国当局逮捕的越侨中的二百人交给南越政权。
    泰国当局以上的行动和企图违反了国际法，违反了联合国宪章，违反了人权宣言，也违反了1955年万隆会议的精神。这种企图完全不照顾到越侨的愿望并且损害越泰两民族的友谊。
    越南民主共和国政府已经致函泰国政府表示反对泰国当局一切损害我国侨胞的生命、财产和名誉的行动以及强迫他们迁往越南南方或把越侨集中到泰国南方的种种违背越侨愿望的做法。目前越南暂时还被分裂为两个地区，越侨愿意回到那个地区他们完全享有自由选择的权利。越侨的这种正当权利必须得到尊重，泰国当局不得强迫他们违背自己的愿望迁往南越去。
    对于被逮捕的越侨，越南民主共和国政府已经要求泰国政府恢复他们的自由，因为他们并没有违犯泰国的法律。并且要求泰国政府按照越侨的愿望安排他们归国。在越南民主共和国政府方面，越南民主共和国政府随时愿意迎接自己的侨民回国。
    关于整个越侨归国问题，越南民主共和国政府认为，越南民主共和国和泰国两国政府有必要委任越南民主共和国红十字会和泰国红十字会进行接触，以商谈各种有关事项，如保证越侨的安全、财产的处理和安排他们归国等等。谈判的地点可由泰国选择，或者在泰国，或者在越南民主共和国，或者在第三个国家里。
    根据亚非各国人民团结互助的精神，根据万隆会议的精神，我希望中华人民共和国支持我国政府要求泰国必须立即停止对越侨的镇压监禁，恢复被捕者的自由，并且尽早开始越南和泰国两红十字会的接触和商谈，以便解决越侨归国问题。
    顺致亲切的敬意。
        越南民主共和国政府总理  范文同（签名）
          1959年1月30日于河内
    此致中华人民共和国国务院总理  周恩来同志
