Implementing the Policy of Combining Education with Productive Labor
Korean Students Study Hard and Work Well
Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang -- Schools at all levels in Korea have achieved remarkable success in implementing the Korean Workers' Party's policy of combining education with productive labor.

Teachers and students of Korean universities, colleges, and middle schools have built many factories and workshops with their own efforts, and they also cultivate experimental fields.

In less than three months, the teachers and students of Hamhung Industrial University established a phosphate fertilizer factory, an oil synthesis factory, a cement factory, and a food factory. They are now producing forty-four kinds of products, including phosphate fertilizer, reflective paper, and photographic film, six of which Korea could not produce in the past. In addition, the teachers and students of Kim Chaek University of Technology have now made semiconductors and are manufacturing helicopters and 6,000-kilowatt hydroelectric generators. Teachers and students of Kim Il-sung University replaced chemical analysis with spectral analysis in soil analysis, increasing efficiency by thirteen times. They also made computers, microscopes, and telescopes. High schools and junior high schools in various places have built a total of 214 factories and 238 workshops, including factories for machinery manufacturing, cement, chemical fertilizers, and textiles, as well as small power stations. Some middle schools contract a workshop or a lathe in a factory to work with the workers, learn technology from the workers, and study the ideology of the working class.

In addition, middle school students in various places are actively learning various production technologies. There are now 7,500 middle school students in northern Korea learning automobile driving technology, and 800 have passed the examination and obtained driver's licenses. In addition, many students are learning to drive tractors. The Young Pioneers in people's schools in various places are also not lagging behind. This year, they will raise 50 million rabbits and produce 5,000 tons of castor beans and silkworm cocoons.

As a result of implementing the combination of education and productive labor, the quality of teaching has been significantly improved. In the 1958-1959 academic year, the results of the first semester examination for second-year students at Hamhung Industrial University showed that 93 out of 297 students were excellent, compared to only 10 in the previous academic year; and 114 students were good, compared to 76 in the previous academic year. In the past, a cement course required 20 hours of instruction, but now that students participate in cement production themselves and have practical knowledge, this course only requires 6 hours of instruction.

Recently, schools in Korea have summarized their experiences in various aspects and will take the work of combining education and productive labor to a higher level. At a conference of educators from universities and colleges, Lee Il-kyung, the Korean Minister of Education and Culture, recently emphasized the need to combine political and moral education, knowledge and cultural education, and production and technical education.

    贯彻教育和生产劳动相结合的方针
    朝鲜学生劳动好读书好
    新华社平壤讯　朝鲜各级学校执行朝鲜劳动党教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，取得了显著的成就。
    朝鲜各大学、专科学校和中学的师生用自己的力量建立了很多工厂和工作室，他们还种试验田。
    咸兴工业大学的师生们在不到三个月的时间内建立了磷肥工厂、油脂合成工厂、水泥工厂、食品工厂等，现在生产着四十四种产品，其中磷肥、反光纸、照像胶卷等六种产品是朝鲜过去不能生产的。另外，金策工业大学的师生们现在制成了半导体，并且正在制造直升飞机、六千瓩的水力发电机等。金日成综合大学的师生在分析土壤的工作中，用光谱分析法代替了化学分析法，提高效率十三倍，他们还制成了计算机、显微镜、望远镜等。各地的高中和初中共建立了二百十四个工厂和二百三十八个工作室，包括机械制造、水泥、化肥、纺织等工厂和小型发电站。有的中学在工厂中包下一个车间或一台车床，来同工人一同劳动。向工人学技术，并且学习工人阶级的思想。
    另外，各地中学生还积极学习各种生产技术，现在朝鲜北部有七千五百个中学生在学汽车驾驶技术，并且已有八百名考试及格取得了司机证。另外还有许多学生学开拖拉机。各地的人民学校的红领巾们也不落后，他们要在今年养五千万只兔子，生产五千吨蓖麻和蚕茧。
    实行教育和生产劳动相结合的结果，教学质量有显著提高，咸兴工业大学在1958—1959学年中，二年级学生上半年学期考试的结果，二百九十七名学生中最优等生达九十三名，而前一学年只有十名；优等生达一百十四名，而前一学年为七十六名。过去讲水泥的课程要讲二十小时，可是现在学生自己参加生产水泥，有实际的知识，这门课程只讲六小时就行了。
    最近，朝鲜各学校总结了各方面的经验，要把教育和生产劳动相结合的工作提高一步。朝鲜教育文化相李一卿最近在大专学校教育工作者会议上强调，要把政治和道德教育、知识文化和生产技术教育结合起来。（附图片）
