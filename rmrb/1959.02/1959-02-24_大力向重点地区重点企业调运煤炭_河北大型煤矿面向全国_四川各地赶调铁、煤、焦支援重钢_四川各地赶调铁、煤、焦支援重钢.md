Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 22nd: Hebei Province's large coal mines resolutely implement the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard" and actively transfer coal to support key regions and key enterprises nationwide.

As of February 17th, Hebei Province had completed 53% of its coal transfer task for February. Among them, the task of transporting to Shanghai was completed by 60%, to Wuhan Iron and Steel Company by 56%, to Anshan Iron and Steel Company by 88%, to Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company by 55%, to railway departments by 64%, and to Beijing by 43%. This situation shows that after studying the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, leading cadres and workers of Hebei's coal mines have further realized the importance of Hebei's coal production in supporting the whole country.

The slogan of the coal mine workers for completing the coal transfer task is: "Load as soon as it arrives, load quickly and transport quickly." During the Spring Festival, in order to ensure the completion of the loading task, coal mines throughout the province mobilized more than 5,000 people to load more than 4,000 vehicles in four days. The mines also organized quick loading and quick transportation shock teams. Fengfeng Coal Mine concentrated thirteen electric chutes from underground for loading and organized nearly four hundred flatbed cars to transport coal to the station. In all mines, leading cadres took the lead and personally directed the operations on-site. A large number of cadres also went down the well to participate in production or loaded vehicles above ground to ensure the completion of the export loading task.

People's Daily, Chongqing, February 23rd: The Sichuan Provincial Party Committee and local city and regional Party Committees are vigorously taking measures to carry out a mass short-distance iron ore transportation campaign to ensure steelmaking in Chongqing's steel mills. Currently, more than 60,000 tons of pig iron accumulated in various places are being transported to transportation trunk lines; on February 16th, more than 3,600 tons of pig iron were shipped from various places, higher than the average daily shipment in the first half of the month; although the shipment of pig iron decreased somewhat on the 17th and 18th due to rain, local Party committees are further taking various measures to strengthen the transfer work.

In order to ensure the production of several key steel mills, at the beginning of this year, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee closely urged local county Party committees to strengthen the leadership of pig iron, coal, and coke transfer work, and held a special meeting to arrange the transfer work. Recently, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee issued instructions to all localities in an emergency telephone conference to immediately launch a mass short-distance transportation campaign, concentrate pig iron, coal, and coke to various transportation trunk lines, and promptly load and transport them to Chongqing steel mills within a limited time. The Provincial Party Committee stipulated that each locality must ship 3,500 to 4,000 tons of pig iron every day to ensure that Chongqing steel mills have four days of "grain and grass" reserves; any area that has not completed the pig iron transfer plan must make up the full amount and must not be short, and requires all localities to prioritize the transportation of pig iron, coal, and coke under the principle of ensuring key needs.

To further improve and strengthen short-distance transportation, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee also instructed all localities to add 100,000 short-distance transportation personnel to the existing workforce. People's communes in various places must establish professional transportation teams as soon as possible to undertake short-distance transportation and concentrate pig iron, coal, coke, and other materials to various transportation trunk lines.

All prefectures and counties are very enthusiastic about transferring pig iron to support the production of key factories. Recently, the local prefectural and county Party committees have respectively held telephone conferences or special cadre meetings to strengthen the leadership and unified deployment of pig iron transfer work; in all localities, the secretary in charge of industry and the responsible cadres of the Transportation Bureau personally led the work teams to participate in and direct the iron transportation. Dazhou Prefecture, which has a large accumulation of pig iron, recently, due to the secretary taking the lead and personally grasping the pig iron transfer work, all counties quickly increased the short-distance transportation force by more than 10,000 people, and unified the deployment of transportation tools, vigorously boosting transportation capacity. The total amount of pig iron shipped out of the entire district has surged from more than 300 tons per day to more than 1,000 tons. Wanxian Prefecture is particularly mountainous and the traffic is extremely inconvenient, and recently it has encountered a rainy season. The entire prefecture's iron transportation army overcame the difficulties of high mountains and slippery roads, and still rushed to transport more than 5,000 tons of pig iron from February 1st to 17th.

    大力向重点地区重点企业调运煤炭
    河北大型煤矿面向全国
    四川各地赶调铁、煤、焦支援重钢
    新华社天津22日电　河北省各大型煤矿坚决贯彻执行全国一盘棋的方针，积极外调煤炭支援全国重点地区和重点企业。
    到2月17日止，河北省2月份外调煤炭的任务已完成53％。其中运往上海的任务完成60％，运往武汉钢铁公司的任务完成56％，运往鞍山钢铁公司的任务完成88％，运给石景山钢铁公司的任务完成55％，运给铁路部门的任务完成64％，运给北京的任务完成43％。这一情况说明，经过学习党的八届六中全会精神，河北各煤矿领导干部和职工群众已进一步认识了河北煤炭生产支援全国的重要性。
    各个煤矿职工对完成外调煤炭任务的口号是：随到随装、快装快运。春节期间，为了保证完成装车任务，全省煤矿共动员了五千多人在四天内装车四千多辆。各矿还组织了快装快运突击队。峰峰煤矿从井下集中了十三台电溜子装车，并组织近四百辆排子车向车站运煤。各矿都是领导干部挂帅，亲自到现场指挥。广大干部也纷纷下井参加生产或在井上装车，保证外运装车任务的完成。
    本报重庆23日电　中共四川省委和各地、市委正大力采取措施，开展群众性的生铁短途突击运输运动，保证重庆各钢厂炼钢。目前积存各地的六万多吨生铁正源源运往交通干线；2月16日各地运出生铁三千六百多吨，比上半月平均日运量都高；17日、18日因雨，生铁运量虽有些下降，但各地党委正进一步采取各种措施，加强调运工作。
    为了保证几个重点钢厂的生产，中共四川省委今年一开头就抓紧督促各地、县委加强生铁、煤和焦炭调运工作的领导，并召开了专门安排调运工作的会议。最近中共四川省委又在紧急电话会议上，指示各地立即开展群众性的短途突击运输，把生铁、煤、焦炭集中到各交通干线，及时抢装、抢运，限期运到重庆钢厂。省委规定，各地每天必须运出三千五百到四千吨生铁，以保证重庆钢厂有四天“粮草”的储备；凡生铁调运没有完成计划的地区要如数补足，不得短少，并要求各地在保证重点的原则下，对物资进行排队，首先抓紧生铁、煤焦等的运输。
    为进一步改善和加强短途运输，中共四川省委还指示各地在现有的人力基础上，再增加十万名短途运输力量。各地人民公社必须尽快建立专业运输队，担负短途运输，把生铁和煤焦等物资集运各交通干线上。
    各专、县对调运生铁支援重点厂生产的热情都很高。最近地、县委都分别召开电话会议或专门的干部会议，加强生铁调运工作的领导和统一布置；各地都由管工业的书记、交通局负责干部亲自带工作组上阵参加和指挥运铁。生铁积存较多的达县专区，最近由于书记挂帅，亲自抓生铁调运工作，各县迅速增加了短途运输力量一万多人，并统一调度运输工具，大搞运力加番。全区生铁由每天外调三百多吨猛增到一千多吨。万县专区特别多山，交通极不方便，最近又遇到多雨季节，全区运铁大军克服了山高路滑的困难，在2月1日到17日仍抢运出生铁五千多吨。
