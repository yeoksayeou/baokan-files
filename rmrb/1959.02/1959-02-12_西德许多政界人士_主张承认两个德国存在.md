Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 11th: More and more politicians in West Germany are advocating recognizing the reality of the existence of two Germanys and demanding negotiations with the German Democratic Republic to resolve the issue of German reunification.

    According to the "Neues Deutschland" newspaper, West German Federal Parliament member, Heinemann (Social Democrat), who once served as Minister of the Interior in the Adenauer government, recently reiterated at a gathering of Social Democrats in Cuxhaven, West Germany, that Bonn should change its policy direction, especially its attitude towards the German Democratic Republic.

    Heinemann emphasized that now is a good time to realistically assess the current situation and seek ways to solve the German question. He believes that while standing with the West, one should not be hostile to the East. Heinemann said that the West's policy to date has failed.

    Heinemann pointed out that for Bonn, there is no other way out of the current predicament except to establish contact with the German Democratic Republic and end the "Cold War."

    In addition, according to the German News Agency, at a recent forum held by politicians in Hamburg, some representatives from various West German parties also advocated holding all-German talks to varying degrees. These people unanimously acknowledged that the existence of the German Democratic Republic is "a fact"; it is necessary to hold talks with it on issues such as the conclusion of a peace treaty; any other attitude is unrealistic.

    At the meeting, Federal Parliament member Rademacher (Free Democrat) advocated establishing a committee with the German Democratic Republic on an equal footing to negotiate peace treaty issues. Federal Parliament member Brachstein (Social Democrat) believed that Bonn's idea of ​​solving the German question with "the military strength of the Federal Republic" is absurd; abandoning atomic armament is the first step towards a possible solution to the German question. Even the representative of the Christian Democratic Union advocated contact with the German Democratic Republic on technical issues.

    西德许多政界人士
    主张承认两个德国存在
    新华社11日讯　柏林消息：西德政界人士中越来越多的人主张承认两个德国存在的现实，要求同德意志民主共和国举行谈判来解决德国统一问题。
    据新德意志报报道，西德联邦议院议员、一度在阿登纳政府中担任过内政部长的海涅曼（社会民主党人）最近在西德库克斯港社会民主党人的一次集会上再一次重申，波恩应改变其政策方针，特别是改变它对德意志民主共和国的态度。
    海涅曼强调说，现在正是现实估计当前局势和寻求解决德国问题的途径的大好时机。他认为，在这样做的时候虽然要同西方站在一起，但却不应该同东方相敌对。海涅曼说，西方迄今为止的政策已经遭到失败。
    海涅曼指出，对波恩来说，要想脱出当前的窘境，除了同德意志民主共和国建立接触和结束“冷战”之外别无其他路可走。
    另外，据德意志通讯社报道，在汉堡政界人士不久前举行的一次座谈会上，分别属于西德各不同党派的一些代表人物也都在不同程度上主张举行全德会谈。这些人士一致承认，德意志民主共和国的存在是“一个事实”；就缔结和约等问题同它进行会谈是必要的；任何其他态度都是不现实的。
    在会上，联邦议院议员拉德马赫（自由民主党人）主张同德意志民主共和国在平等的基础上成立一个委员会来谈判和约问题。联邦议院议员布拉赫施泰因（社会民主党人）认为，波恩想要用“联邦共和国的军事实力”来解决德国问题的想法是荒谬的；放弃原子武装才是可能解决德国问题的第一个步骤。连基督教民主联盟的代表也主张同德意志民主共和国在技术性问题上进行接触。
