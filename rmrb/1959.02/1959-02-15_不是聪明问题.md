    Not a Question of Intelligence
    Yao Renwei
    “They’re intelligent, I'm not!” This phrase often becomes the mantra for some who are content to remain downstream, refusing to accept new things. And whenever they say this, they always seem to be talking about others, without any sense of shame; strangely, listeners often don't think twice, tacitly agreeing.
    Is "intelligence" really the problem? Where does it manifest itself correctly? After reading "The Ingenious Girl Movement" in the seventh issue of "Red Flag" last year and "People Call Us 'Ingenious Girls'," written by Song Chou'er, a national women's activist representative from Mǐshān Township, Jìnchéng County, Shānxī, published in the "People's Daily" on December 8th, I had some enlightenment. Song Chou'er, Wáng Lèpíng, and Lǐ Chūnhuā, these three ordinary rural girls, are able to lend a hand in deep plowing, close planting, seed soaking, seed mixing, weeding, seedling thinning, vegetable planting, pollination; beekeeping, grafting, pig raising, chicken raising; well digging, canal opening, water conservation and water management; flower cutting, embroidery, tailoring, flower piling; ball bearing making, steel smelting, treadle cotton ginning, and other tasks. To build a new socialist countryside, they learn whatever is needed, creating miracles in everything they do. No one can deny that they are intelligent, so the masses call them "Ingenious Girls." But is their "intelligence" and "ingenuity" determined by "talent" or "genius," as some people believe? Is "intelligence" the "gift" of a select few? The answer is no to both. The key to going from not being able to do something to being able to do it lies in: first, getting rid of feelings of inferiority and daring to think and speak; second, being down-to-earth, studying hard, and working hard. Isn't that the truth? In the spring of 1956, their commune mobilized well digging, and some people opposed it, saying: "For generations, no one has ever heard of being able to dig wells and grow vegetables in Mǐshān. These people now, they're really trying to draw water from a dragon's back, just messing around." Song Chou'er and the other two discussed it and said: "We are Party members and Youth League members, we must do new things that our predecessors have not done, and set an example for everyone!" "If you don't believe us, we'll just wait and see! The Party branch supports us, there's nothing we can't do." Sure enough, they did things that others dared not do. Their personal experience is: "When we learn, we delve in, and once we delve in, we will master it, and once we master it, we use it, and once we use it, we delve in again." From this, we can understand that "intelligence" is nothing more than the close combination of lofty revolutionary ideals and a pragmatic scientific spirit. From the development of the "Ingenious Girl" movement, and the emergence of more than seven hundred ingenious girls and more than five thousand six hundred female experts in the whole county, we can also understand that "intelligence" is not the "gift" of a few, but something that everyone can learn. As someone said, "Genius is due to accumulation, intelligence lies in learning." Those who constantly emphasize that others are intelligent and they are not, are either crushed by the burden of inferiority and unable to get up, or are complete ideological lazybones.
    Our spirit should be: As long as something is possible, if others don't dare to do it, we must dare to do it; if others can't do it, we must be able to do it.

    不是聪明问题
    姚人为
    “人家聪明嘛，我不行！”这句话常常成为某些人甘居下游，拒绝接受新事物的口头禅。而且每当他们说这句话的时候总好像在谈论别人似的，毫无愧色；可怪的是听的人也常常不加思索，大有默许之意。
    “聪明”是不是问题？它正确体现在哪里？前后读了登在去年第七期“红旗”上的“巧姑娘运动”和12月8日“人民日报”刊出全国妇女积极分子代表、山西晋城县米山乡宋丑儿自己写的“人家叫我们‘巧姑娘’”这两篇文章，很有一些启示。宋丑儿、王乐平和李春花这三个普通的农村姑娘，她们对深翻、密植、浸种、拌种、锄苗、定苗、种菜、授粉；养蜂、接树、养猪、养鸡；打井、开渠、水保水利；剪花、刺绣、裁缝、堆花；捣滚珠、炼钢铁、蹬轧花机等等活计都能插上手。她们为了建设社会主义新农村，干啥学啥，样样创奇迹，谁也不能不承认她们是聪明的，因此群众都叫她们“巧姑娘”。但是，她们的“聪明”和“巧”，是不是就像有些人迷信的那样是由于“天资”或“天才”所决定的呢？是不是“聪明”成为少数人“天赋”的产物呢？回答都是否定的。由不行到行，关键问题在于：一是打掉自卑感，敢想敢说；二是脚踏实地，苦学苦干。事实不正是这样吗？1956年春天，她们社里发动打井，有人反对说：“祖祖辈辈就没听说过米山能打井种菜，现在这些人哪，真是龙背上取水，瞎胡干。”宋丑儿等三人就商量说：“咱们是党团员，要干前人没干过的新事，给大家摆出个样子看看！”“不信，咱们就走着看！党支部支持我们，就没有办不成的事。”果然，别人不敢作的事，她们都作出来了。她们亲身的体会是：“我们要学就钻，一钻就会，会了就用，用了再钻。”从这里我们可以懂得“聪明”不是别的，而是远大的革命理想和实事求是的科学精神的紧密结合。从“巧姑娘”运动的展开，全县涌现出了七百多个巧姑娘和五千六百多个女土专家这件事来看，还可以懂得“聪明”根本不是少数人“天赋”的产物。而是人人可学得的。有人说得好：“天才由于积累，聪明在于学习。”那些口口声声强调人家聪明自己不行的人，不是被自卑感的重担压倒爬不起来，便是十足的思想懒汉。
    我们的气概应该是：只要是可能作的事，别人不敢办，我们要敢办；别人办不到的，我们要能办到。
