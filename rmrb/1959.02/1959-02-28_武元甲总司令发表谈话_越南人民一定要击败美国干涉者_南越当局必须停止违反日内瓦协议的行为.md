Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 26th – According to a Vietnam News Agency report on February 26th, General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, told a Moscow Radio correspondent in Hanoi that "U.S. imperialism must not interfere" is the common demand of 25 million Vietnamese people. If the U.S. imperialists ignore our demands, then surely one day our people will force them to pack their bags and get out.

Speaking of improving the implementation of the Geneva Accords, Vo Nguyen Giap said that the current situation can be simply summarized as follows: the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has strictly implemented the Geneva Accords, while the South Vietnamese authorities violate this agreement every day, and with increasing severity. Vo Nguyen Giap believes that in order to improve this situation, the South Vietnamese authorities should accept the very practical suggestions made by Premier Pham Van Dong in his note to South Vietnam on December 22 last year.

He continued, more specifically, the South Vietnamese authorities must immediately cease their policy of persecuting and suppressing patriots and peace-loving people, and at the same time discuss the following four issues with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam: both sides reduce their armed forces; both sides guarantee not to join any military alliance or employ foreign military personnel; conduct trade exchanges, which are beneficial to both sides; both sides prohibit all war propaganda and propaganda that helps to spread discord between the North and South; both sides agree to allow free communication and the free exchange of scientific, economic, cultural groups and women and children between the two parts of the region.

Referring to the massacre in Phu Loi, he said that this massacre is the most barbaric in the history of Vietnam and the modern world. In this massacre, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities were the murderers. He also expressed concern about the fate of the surviving political prisoners in the Phu Loi concentration camp.

Vo Nguyen Giap pointed out that in addition to the Phu Loi concentration camp, other concentration camps and prisons in South Vietnam also imprison tens of thousands of patriots and former resistance fighters who oppose the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique. A policy of suppression and massacre is now being carried out throughout South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese authorities are turning South Vietnam into a large prison. He said that the Vietnamese people will continue to struggle to expose the truth of the Phu Loi concentration camp massacre, demand that the South Vietnamese authorities stop implementing the policy of suppression and persecution, disband the Hitler-style concentration camps, and release all patriotic fighters who are currently detained.

Vo Nguyen Giap exposed that U.S. imperialism is intensifying its interference in South Vietnam. He said that currently, nearly two thousand U.S. military advisors are responsible for the expansion of the Ngo Dinh Diem army and its headquarters, as well as for the military bases in South Vietnam. Recently, the International Commission made a resolution that the "Temporary Equipment Replenishment Mission" belonging to the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group, which was illegally established in South Vietnam, should withdraw from South Vietnam before June this year. He said that we agree with this decision and demand that the U.S. imperialists and the South Vietnamese authorities strictly abide by this decision.

He added, however, that the withdrawal of the "Temporary Equipment Replenishment Mission" from South Vietnam does not mean that the problem has been solved. We demand that the thousands of U.S. military advisors currently in the South should withdraw from South Vietnam, and that the U.S. imperialists and the South Vietnamese authorities should stop transporting new U.S. military equipment into South Vietnam. They should stop expanding existing military bases and stop building new military bases, which, according to U.S. plans, is currently underway.

General Vo Nguyen Giap said that the cause of the Vietnamese people in consolidating peace and reunifying the country cannot be determined by the U.S. interventionists. It will ultimately be determined by the Vietnamese people. Therefore, we believe that Vietnam will surely be reunified, and the U.S. interventionists and their running dogs will be defeated. Therefore, despite the various difficulties that exist at present, the terms of the Geneva Accords will still be implemented in the future.

    武元甲总司令发表谈话
    越南人民一定要击败美国干涉者
    南越当局必须停止违反日内瓦协议的行为
    新华社河内26日电　据越南通讯社26日报道，越南人民军总司令武元甲大将向莫斯科电台驻河内记者说，“美帝国主义不得进行干涉”是两千五百万越南人民的共同要求。如果美帝国主义者不理会我们的要求，那么肯定有一天我们的人民将强迫他们收拾行装滚出去。
    武元甲在谈到改进执行日内瓦协议的工作时说，当前的情况可以简单归纳如下：越南民主共和国政府严格地执行了日内瓦协议，而南越当局却每天都在违反这个协议，而且越来越严重。武元甲认为，为了改善这种情况，南越当局应当接受越南民主共和国政府的非常切实可行的建议。这个建议是范文同总理在去年12月22日给南越的照会中提出来的。
    他接着说，说得更具体一点，南越当局必须马上停止迫害和镇压爱国者和爱好和平者的政策，同时和越南民主共和国讨论下列四个问题：双方削减武装力量，双方保证不加入任何军事联盟或者雇用外国军事人员；进行贸易往来，这是对双方都有益的；双方禁止一切战争宣传以及有助于在南北方之间散布不和的宣传；双方同意允许自由通信以及两部分地区的科学、经济、文化团体和妇女儿童的自由来往。
    谈到关于富利大屠杀的惨案时，他说，这场大屠杀在越南和现代世界的历史上是最野蛮的。在这场大屠杀里，吴庭艳当局是凶手。他并且对富利集中营的幸存的政治犯的命运表示担忧。
    武元甲指出，除了富利集中营以外，南越其他的集中营和监狱里也囚禁着成千上万反对美国—吴庭艳集团的爱国者和前抗战志士。现在在南越各地都在执行镇压和屠杀的政策。南越当局正在使南越变成一个大监狱。他说，越南人民将继续斗争，把富利集中营屠杀事件的真相揭发出来，要求南越当局停止执行镇压和迫害的政策，解散希特勒式的集中营和释放一切现在被拘禁的爱国志士。
    武元甲揭露了美帝国主义在加强干涉南越，他说，目前，将近有二千名美军顾问负责吴庭艳军队的扩军和司令部工作，以及负责南越的军事基地。最近，国际委员会作出决议：在南越非法建立的美国军事援助顾问团所属的“美国临时装备更新团”应该在今年6月份前撤出南越。他说，我们同意这个决定，并且要求美帝国主义者和南越当局严格遵守这个决定。
    他又说，但是，“美国临时装备更新团”从南越撤出并不等于这个问题已经解决。我们要求，现在在南方的数以千计的美国军事顾问应该从南越撤出，美帝国主义者和南越当局应该停止把新的美国军火运入南越，他们应该停止扩大原有的军事基地和停止建立新的军事基地，而根据美国的计划，这种工作正在进行。
    武元甲大将说，越南人民巩固和平和重新统一国家的事业是不能够由美国干涉者来决定的。它最终将由越南人民来决定。因此，我们相信，越南一定会重新统一，美国干涉者和他们的走狗将被击败。因此，尽管目前存在各种各样的困难，日内瓦协定的条款将来还是会被执行的。
