Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 15th: According to a U.S. State Department spokesman on the 14th, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles has suffered a second bout of cancer and will continue to be off work for treatment.

Dulles underwent a hernia operation at Walter Reed Army Hospital on the 13th. A treatment report released by the hospital on the 14th stated that a small "radium tube" taken from the hernia sac during the operation, upon examination, was found to be "adenocarcinoma." The report also said that microscopic examination of the fluid removed after treating the hernia sac revealed "free cancer cells." Dulles underwent adenocarcinoma surgery in 1956, during which a cancerous portion of his lower intestine was removed.

Before the hospital officially released the treatment bulletin, U.S. President Eisenhower, accompanied by a group of senior aides and Dulles' brother, Allen Dulles, rushed to Walter Reed Army Hospital to see Dulles. Eisenhower, after spending thirty-seven minutes at Dulles' bedside, issued a statement saying that the extent of Dulles' malignant condition "has not been fully determined, but further treatment is certainly needed."

Sources say that doctors generally believe Dulles' cancer is incurable. The cancerous cells are suspended in the fluid within the abdominal cavity, and while these cells can be treated with X-rays, it is very difficult.

The U.S. government announced that Deputy Secretary of State Herter will temporarily assume Dulles' duties. Herter has ended his vacation in South Carolina and returned to Washington yesterday.

Although the U.S. government had repeatedly stated in recent days that Dulles' resignation was not being considered, Western news agencies are now widely predicting that Dulles' replacement is inevitable.

Just as the "brinkmanship" policy and the policy of intensifying the "Cold War" formulated and implemented by Dulles were suffering serious setbacks, and the North Atlantic bloc was mired in division and chaos over a series of important issues, the news of Dulles' deteriorating health caused widespread anxiety and unease among politicians in the United States and its allies.

U.S. congressional leaders expressed serious concern that Dulles' second bout of cancer could hinder the implementation of U.S. foreign policy during a "time of crisis." Senator Church, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that "Dulles' leave of absence is a critical matter occurring at a critical time." Officials in the West German Adenauer government "felt very frustrated." They feared that "a spoke has broken in the wheel of the West's formulation of policy on the German question." A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said that this was "very bad news" for the West. British Prime Minister Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Lloyd also expressed "great regret" at the news.

    杜勒斯癌症复发
    新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：据美国国务院发言人14日宣布，美国国务卿杜勒斯第二次患了癌症，他将继续离职治疗。
    杜勒斯13日在华尔特·里德陆军医院动了疝气手术。这个医院在14日发表的一份治疗报告中说，在动手术时从疝气囊拿出的一个小“镭管”，根据研究结果，证明患“腺癌”。治疗报告还说，治疗疝气囊之后拿出的液体在显微镜下发现有“自由癌细胞”。杜勒斯在1956年曾经动过腺癌手术，那次拿掉了他肠子下面的长癌的部分。
    在医院正式发表治疗公报之前，美国总统艾森豪威尔带着一批高级助手以及杜勒斯的弟弟艾伦·杜勒斯等人匆匆赶到华尔特·里德陆军医院去看杜勒斯。艾森豪威尔在杜勒斯病床旁呆了三十七分钟以后发表声明说，杜勒斯的症状“恶性的程度如何尚未完全断定，但是肯定需要进一步治疗”。
    有消息说，据医生们透露，一般认为杜勒斯所患的癌症是治不好的。癌肿的细胞浮悬在腹腔内的液体中，那些细胞虽然可以用X光治疗，可是很困难。
    美国政府宣布，杜勒斯的职务现在决定由副国务卿赫脱暂时代理。赫脱已经结束了他在南卡罗来纳州的假期在昨天赶回华盛顿。
    虽然美国政府前几天曾经一再声明说不考虑杜勒斯的辞职问题，但是现在西方通讯社已经纷纷预测：杜勒斯的更换已经是不可避免的了。
    正当美国由杜勒斯拟订和执行的“边缘”政策和加剧“冷战”的政策遭到了严重的失败，而北大西洋集团内部正在一系列重要问题上陷于四分五裂和混乱的时候，杜勒斯病况恶化的消息在美国国内和它的盟国的政界人士中引起了一片焦虑和不安。
    美国国会领袖们表示严重担心，杜勒斯第二次患癌症可能妨碍在一个“危机时期”美国外交政策的推行。参议院外交委员会委员丘奇说，“杜勒斯的请假是在危急时期发生的一件危急的事。”西德阿登纳政府官员“感到十分沮丧”。他们担心“西方拟订对德国问题政策的车轮折断了一根辐条”。法国外交部的一位发言人说，这对西方来说“是一个很坏的消息”。英国首相麦克米伦和外交大臣劳埃德也对这一消息表示“非常遗憾”。
