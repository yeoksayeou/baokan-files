 	A Happy Home for Revolutionary Martyrs' Families
 	--A Visit to the Revolutionary Martyrs' Nursing Home in the Suburbs of Tangshan Before the Spring Festival
 	Wang Zhuofei, Wen Guangjun

 	Visiting and comforting families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers is a new folk custom and tradition that has been preserved since the war years. Before the Spring Festival, we, like other visitors, came to the suburbs of Tangshan with respect and visited the Revolutionary Martyrs' Nursing Home.

 	The Nursing Home is Full of Spring
 	This glorious home was established on National Day last year. The nursing home is a courtyard with more than 30 rooms, each of which is bright, clean and tidy. Inside the rooms are also hung glory flowers, honorary plaques, and the meritorious service reports of the martyrs during their lifetimes.

 	The nursing home provides the elderly with clothing, food, and pocket money. The director, cooks, and service staff are responsible for taking care of their lives. The nursing home's recreation room has various items for leisure, such as chess, checkers, picture books, and comic books.

 	The nursing home already has a construction plan, preparing to turn the backyard into a garden when the weather is warmer, plant grapes, build a fish pond, and also prepare to plant flowers and raise rabbits there, all to increase the enjoyment of life for the elderly.

 	Those who are personally present do not feel the twilight of old age here, but are filled with the breath of spring everywhere.

 	Parents of Heroes
 	During our visit to the elderly, we learned that their sons—the martyrs—were all good children of the Party, and the elderly also had a loyal heart, forever facing the Party.

 	We visited Grandma Tan Ping in the fourth dormitory of the nursing home. She is 73 years old this year. Her son joined the revolution in 1934 and later died gloriously.

 	During the war years, Grandma Tan was known as a revolutionary mother. Because she sheltered underground Party comrades, she was arrested twice by the enemy and suffered torture, but she never revealed the Party's secrets.

 	After liberation, Grandma Tan participated in street work and always actively responded to the Party's call. She has been repeatedly rated as a model. Currently, her room still has six certificates of merit for model workers and activists awarded by Hebei Province and Tangshan City.

 	In Grandpa Li Defang's dormitory, we listened to Grandpa Li tell us the story of his love for the People's Army and his son's heroic sacrifice. In 1946, his hometown was a guerrilla zone. The Kuomintang army arrested his son, Li Quanlai, to be a soldier. Grandpa Li tried various ways to get some money to redeem his son, and then mobilized his son to join the Eighth Route Army. Once, Li Quanlai and five soldiers were active together and encountered a large group of enemies. Li Quanlai was wounded by a machine gun and could not move. He handed the gun to his comrades, forcing them to retreat, while he stayed behind with a grenade to cover them, finally sacrificing himself gloriously to preserve his comrades.

 	Care and Respect
 	Since its establishment, this nursing home has received care and respect from all sides.

 	The district party secretary and district head often come to visit the elderly. Shops, vegetable markets, and grain stores deliver the things the nursing home needs to their door and give priority to the elderly. During the New Year, the People's Commune sent peanuts and cabbage for the elderly to celebrate the New Year. Students from schools also often come to comfort them. Every festival, students come to build arches for the nursing home, and usually help the elderly wipe windows and sweep the yard.

 	The officers and soldiers of the troops have even more respect for the families of revolutionary martyrs. A soldier wrote in a letter: Dear parents, although your son has sacrificed gloriously, you still have thousands upon thousands of sons. Your lives are not lonely. This soldier expressed that he would work hard to learn his skills and defend the socialist construction of the motherland. There are many similar letters.

 	Missing the Soldiers
 	The elderly also miss the soldiers at the front very much. The Spring Festival is approaching, and they have written many letters to the front.

 	Grandma Li Zhifeng introduced her son's heroic deeds in a letter to the front. Her son sacrificed in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. During the famous Jinzhou Campaign in the Liberation War, her son once carried explosives, passed through the enemy's artillery fire, and destroyed the enemy's bunker, earning a great merit. The certificate of merit is still hanging in front of Grandma Li's bed. Grandma Li exhorted the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in the letter, hoping that they would defend the motherland well at the front and make contributions to the motherland.

 	Grandma Wang Suhua, who is 74 years old, also wrote a letter to the front. Her son joined the Eighth Route Army in 1940. She still clearly remembers what her son said to her when he left: Mom, let me go! If I leave, someone will take care of you. If I die, someone will support you. This is indeed the case. Now, Grandma Wang says in her letter to the soldiers at the front: I am in the Revolutionary Martyrs' Nursing Home, someone supports me, and life is very good, please rest assured. You are all good lads like my son. You must study technology well, exercise your bodies, drive away the American imperialists, and liberate Taiwan.

### 光荣之家幸福多——春节前访唐山市郊区烈属养老院

    光荣之家幸福多
    ——春节前访唐山市郊区烈属养老院
    王濯非　温光均
    节日慰问烈军属，这是从战争年代一直保留下来的民间新的风俗，新的传统。春节前，我们同其他访问者一样怀着尊敬的心情，来到唐山市郊区，访问了烈属养老院。
  养老院里春意浓
    这个光荣之家是在去年国庆节成立的。养老院是一个四合院，有三十多间房子，每间房子都是窗明几净，清洁整齐。屋内还挂着光荣花、光荣匾和烈士们生前的立功喜报。
    老人穿衣、吃饭、零用钱都由养老院供给，生活有院长、炊事员和服务员，负责照顾。养老院的游艺室内有象棋、跳棋、画报、小人书等各种供消遣的东西。
    养老院已有了一个建设计划，准备在天气暖和的时候，把后院改为花园，种上葡萄，建个养鱼池，还准备在那里种花、养兔，一切为了使老人们增加生活的乐趣。
    身历其境的人，感觉不到这里有晚年的暮意，而是到处充满了春天的气息。
      英雄父母
    我们在访问老人时，得知他们的儿子——烈士们都是党的好儿女，老人们也是一片忠心，永远向着党。
    我们在养老院第四宿舍里访问了谭萍老大娘，她今年七十三岁了，儿子在1934年参加革命，后来光荣地牺牲了。
    在战争年代，谭老大娘被人们称为革命母亲。因为她掩护地下党的同志，曾被敌人逮捕过两次，受尽了拷打，但她始终没有泄露党的秘密。
    解放后，谭老大娘参加了街道工作，一贯积极响应党的号召。多次被评为模范，现在，她房间里还挂着六张由河北省、唐山市送的模范工作者和积极分子的奖状。
    我们在李德方老大爷的宿舍里，听李大爷向我们讲他热爱人民军队和他儿子英勇牺牲的故事。在1946年的时候，他的家乡是游击区，国民党军队把他的儿子李全来抓去当兵，李老大爷想了各种办法弄一些钱把儿子赎回来，然后动员儿子参加了八路军。有一次，李全来和五个战士一起活动，遇到了大股的敌人，李全来被机枪打伤了，不能走动。他把枪交给了战友，逼着战友们撤退，而自己拿着手榴弹留下来掩护，最后以光荣的自我牺牲来保全了同志。
      关怀和尊敬
    这个养老院成立以来，受到各方面的关怀和尊敬。
    区委书记和区长常来看望老人。商店、菜市场、粮店都把养老院需要的东西送上门，并优先照顾老人。新年时，人民公社送来花生、白菜给老人过年。学校的学生也常来慰问，每到过节的时候，学生就来替养老院扎牌楼，平时就帮助老人擦玻璃、扫院子。
    部队的官兵更加尊敬烈属。一位战士的信上说：亲爱的爸妈们，你们的儿子虽然光荣牺牲了，但是你们还有上千上万的儿子，你们的生活并不孤单。这位战士表示要努力学好本领，保卫祖国的社会主义建设。类似这样的信是很多的。
        怀念战士
    老人们也十分怀念前方的战士。春节快到了，他们写了很多信寄往前方。
    李志凤老大娘在给前方的信上介绍了她儿子的英雄事迹，她的儿子是在抗美援朝战争中牺牲的。在解放战争时期著名的锦州战役中，她儿子曾抱着炸药，穿过敌人的炮火，炸毁了敌人的碉堡，立了一大功。立功奖状现在还挂在李大娘的床前。李大娘在信上叮咛解放军的战士，希望他们在前方好好的保卫祖国，为祖国立功。
    七十四岁的王素花老大娘也写信捎给前方。她的儿子是在1940年参加八路军的。她现在还清楚地记得儿子临走时对她说的话：妈妈，让我走吧！我走了，会有人照顾您，我死了，会有人养活您。事情的确是这样，现在王老大娘在给前方战士的信上这样说：我在烈属养老院，有人养活我，生活非常好，请你们放心。你们都和我儿子一样是棒小伙子，要好好学习技术，锻炼身体，赶走美帝，解放台湾。
