Grasp Technology, Attack Pig Iron

In order to improve the output and quality of small converters, the relevant departments in Anhui Province have earnestly summarized many technical experiences. Through those figures and technical "jargon," it can be seen that they are truly striving to make economic work "more and more meticulous."

This style of leadership and leadership method is worth greatly promoting. It can be used not only to grasp steel production, but also to grasp iron production. At present, grasping pig iron is the central link to ensure the growth of steel production. We suggest that comrades in all regions, including those in Anhui Province, carry forward this style, promote this method, and quickly grasp the technology of ironmaking: how to make blast furnaces produce more and better iron, use less coke, and lower costs.

More iron means more steel; with good iron, it is easier to make good steel. We hope that all comrades in charge of large, medium, and small blast furnaces will come and fiercely grasp iron production.

    抓技术　攻生铁
    安徽省有关部门为了提高小转炉的产量和质量，切切实实地总结了技术方面的许多经验。通过那些数目字和技术上的“行话”，可以看出他们真是在努力把经济工作“越做越细致”。
    这种领导作风和领导方法，值得大大提倡。它不但可以用于抓钢的生产，也可以用于抓铁的生产。在目前，抓生铁又是保证钢产量增长的中心环节。我们建议，各个地区，也包括安徽省的同志们在内，发扬这种作风，推广这种方法，迅速抓一抓炼铁方面的技术：怎样使高炉生产得更多，更好，焦炭用得更少，成本更低。
    铁多，钢就多了；有了好铁，炼好钢也就容易了。愿掌管一切大、中、小高炉的同志们都来狠狠地抓铁。
