Skillfully Applying Topdressing Fertilizer to Increase Rapeseed Production
Wang Quanfu, Zhou Maoyuan

Rapeseed has tremendous potential for branching and pod formation. We know that in previous years, ordinary field rapeseed generally had only five to eight branches per plant (referring to the first-order branches, the same below), about 150 to 200 pods per plant, and an average of about 15 to 20 seeds per pod. However, well-grown rapeseed can have 10 to 20 branches per plant, 500 to 1,000 pods, and 25 to 30 seeds per pod. This year's large-area rapeseed, due to better deep plowing than in previous years, and on the basis of close planting, adopts effective measures to strive for more than ten to fifteen branches per plant, a pod number of more than 300 to 500 per plant, and a seed number of 20 to 25 per pod. Then, the rapeseed yield per unit area has the potential to reach a high-yield level of 300 jin, 500 jin, or even more than 1,000 jin per mu, based on the past yield of about 100 jin per mu. Last year, a rapeseed plant in Zhong County, Sichuan, due to heavy fertilization and good management, had more than 700 branches (including re-branching) and more than 50,000 pods, with a single plant yield of more than six jin. This example fully demonstrates that it is entirely possible to strive for more branches, more pods, more seeds, and heavier seeds in rapeseed, and it also shows that rapeseed still has great potential for increasing production.

The primary measure to strive for "more branches, more pods, more seeds, and heavier seeds" in rapeseed is to heavily apply topdressing fertilizer. Over the past few years, considerable experience has been accumulated both inside and outside the province regarding the application of topdressing fertilizer to rapeseed. For example, farmers in Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, a nationally renowned advanced rapeseed area, summed up the benefits of applying fertilizer to rapeseed in spring as: First irrigation promotes root growth, second irrigation promotes branching, third irrigation ensures flowering to the top, and fourth irrigation makes rapeseed seeds like fish eyes. The county's widespread application of fertilizer four times in the spring of 1958 was a decisive factor in obtaining the national red flag for rapeseed production. Farmers in Sichuan Province proposed that rapeseed topdressing should adhere to the principle of "less first, more later, dilute first, then concentrated," correctly reflecting that the period when rapeseed needs the most fertilizer is after the budding stage in spring, rather than the seedling stage before budding. The "five meals must not be missed, both ends must be full" proposed by Hubei Province and the "rapeseed gets rich in old age" that has long been circulating among farmers in Hunan Province clearly point out that late topdressing has a decisive significance for increasing rapeseed production. The Hunan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Shaoyang Prefecture agricultural research institutions conducted experiments on spring fertilization of rapeseed in 1955 to 1956 and 1956 to 1957, and the results showed significant yield increases. Sweet rapeseed varieties yielded 62% more with topdressing fertilizer than without, and 34% more with flower fertilizer; Victory rapeseed, after two spring topdressing applications, yielded 41%-91% more than without topdressing. In the rapeseed producing areas of Hunan Province, there are countless examples of increased production from spring topdressing.

To achieve the standard of "heavy application" of topdressing fertilizer, it is necessary to break with convention and ensure good quality and large quantity. Generally, 30 to 40 dan of well-rotted human and animal manure (diluted with about one times the amount of water) or 25 to 30 jin of ammonium sulfate (mixed with four to five times the amount of soil) should be applied per mu to sweet rapeseed, around the base of the plant. Victory rapeseed is more fertilizer-tolerant, and the amount of fertilizer should be increased by 30% to 50% compared to sweet rapeseed. The time for applying topdressing fertilizer starts from mid-February, and it is generally better to start early than late. If it is too late, the plant will grow too tall, making field operations inconvenient and not conducive to more branching. It is best to apply fertilizer once when the rapeseed begins to bud and again when the flower spikes are about one foot high. Combine the application with middle tillage and earthing up, clearing ditches and draining water to avoid nutrient loss and waterlogging during the rainy season, which will affect the later growth of rapeseed.

Spraying phosphate fertilizer on the leaves during the full bloom stage of rapeseed has a significant effect on the flowering of rapeseed, promoting more seeds and heavier seeds. Generally, two to four jin of superphosphate can be mixed with one hundred to two hundred jin of water per mu. After filtering, spray the solution on the leaves with a sprayer. Spray once every three to five days, for a total of two to three times, to achieve the effect of increasing production. If four to five qian of boric acid is added to every hundred jin of water when spraying phosphorus, it can quickly transport the nutrients in the roots, stems, and leaves of the rapeseed to the seeds, increasing the seed weight.

Judging from the experience of many high-yields in recent years, another important measure to strive for "more branches, more pods, more seeds, and heavier seeds" in rapeseed is to remove yellow leaves and pinch off the top buds to ensure that the pods are not affected by spring cold and diseases. This year, some early-sown rapeseed in Hunan has grown vigorously before winter, but a few leaves have turned yellow. These yellow leaves are mostly at the base, affecting ventilation and light transmission in the lower part. At the same time, the long-term shade and humidity of the ground are also conducive to the development of sclerotinia and downy mildew mycelium of rapeseed. After these fungal spores germinate, they first harm the weaker yellow leaves, and then continue to invade the good leaves and stems, seriously causing the entire plant to fail. Therefore, in early spring, a general cleaning of the field should be carried out to remove all yellow leaves and weeds.

Rapeseed is a cross-pollinated crop, and pollination relies on insects and wind to spread pollen during flowering. If the climatic conditions are not good, the pollination will be incomplete, affecting the number of pods and seeds. According to observations by the Hunan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the number of pods set by rapeseed is generally only about 70% of the total number of flowers, and as low as 40% to 50%, which seriously affects the yield per unit area of rapeseed. In order to increase the seed setting rate of rapeseed and strive for more than 95% of the flowers to set seeds, it is necessary to vigorously promote beekeeping, set up beehives in the fields, and strengthen the pollination of bees. In areas with few bees, artificial assisted pollination can also be promoted. Use bamboo poles or ropes (preferably connected with sheets or long towels) to gently drag them over the rapeseed flowers on sunny days when the dew is about to dry. Carry out this process three to four times to increase pollination opportunities, improve the seed setting rate, and achieve the purpose of increasing production.

Pest and disease control of rapeseed must be actively carried out to ensure that rapeseed is not harmed. In addition to measures such as ditching and drainage, middle tillage during the budding stage, and removal of yellow leaves, pay attention to field inspections starting from the end of February. If downy mildew is found, Bordeaux mixture 1:1:200 can be sprayed, with a dosage of 150 to 200 jin per mu, and sprayed once every ten days or so. The number of sprays depends on the severity of the disease. If insect pests occur at the same time, Bordeaux mixture and 666 can be mixed for combined treatment, and pay attention to mixing and applying at the same time. For sclerotinia of rapeseed, check frequently in the early stage of pod formation when the temperature reaches above 20 degrees Celsius and it is rainy and humid. In the early stage of the disease, spray and sprinkle 1:15 cyanamide slaked lime powder in time, with a dosage of about 10 jin per mu. For the prevention and control of virus diseases, the main focus is on eradicating aphids. Spraying wettable 666 at 1:200-300 dilution or 50 times the concentration of tobacco soapy water multiple times during the seedling stage can completely eliminate aphids.

    巧施抽苔肥增产油菜籽
    王全夫　周懋元
    油菜分枝结荚的潜力是很巨大的。我们知道，往年一般大田的油菜，每株分枝（指第一次分枝，下同）一般只有五至八个，每株荚果约一百五十至二百个，每荚平均籽粒约十五至二十粒。而生长较好的油菜，每株却能有十至二十个分枝，五百至一千个荚果，每荚二十五至三十粒种子。今年的大面积油菜，由于深耕比往年好，在密植的基础上，采取有效措施，力争每株分枝十到十五个以上，每株结荚数达到三百至五百个以上，每荚粒数达到二十至二十五粒以上，那么，油菜的单位面积产量就有条件从过去亩产一百斤左右的基础上，达到大面积亩产三百斤、五百斤甚至一千斤以上的高产水平。去年四川忠县的一株油菜，由于施肥多、管理好，全株共分枝七百多个（包括再分枝），结荚五万多个，单株产量达六斤以上。这个例子充分说明，争取油菜枝多、荚多、粒多、粒重是完全可能的，同时也显示出油菜还有很大的增产潜力。
    争取油菜“枝多、荚多、粒多、粒重”的首要措施是重施苔肥。几年来省内外对于油菜施用苔肥，已经积累了相当丰富的经验。如全国著名的油菜先进地区——江苏兴化县农民总结油菜春季施肥的好处是：一浇长根，二浇长杈（分枝），三浇开花到顶，四浇菜籽像个鱼眼睛。该县1958年春季普遍追肥四次，是获得了全国油菜生产的红旗的决定性因素。四川省农民提出油菜追肥要掌握先少后多、先淡后浓的原则，正确地体现油菜需肥最多的时期是在春季现蕾之后，而不是现蕾之前的幼苗时期。湖北省提出的“五餐不可少，两头要吃饱”和湖南省农民流传已久的“油菜老来富”等经验，都十分明确的指出后期追肥对油菜增产具有决定性的意义。湖南省农业科学研究所和邵阳专区农业研究机关，曾于1955年到1956年，和1956年至1957年两年中，进行油菜春季施肥的试验，结果都显著增产。甜油菜类型的品种，施苔肥较不施苔肥增产62％，施花肥增产34％；胜利油菜春季追施苔肥二次，较不追肥增产41％—91％。在湖南省各油菜产区，春季追施苔肥获得增产的事例更是不胜枚举。
    追施苔肥要达到“重施”的标准，必须打破常规，做到质好量多。一般甜油菜每亩用腐熟的人畜粪尿三、四十担（兑水一倍左右）或用硫酸铵二十五至三十斤（拌土四、五倍），施在蔸旁。胜利油菜耐肥性更强，施肥量要比甜油菜增加三到五成比较恰当。施用苔肥的时间从2月中旬起开始，一般宜早不宜迟，过迟植株长高了，田间操作不便，且无助于多发分枝。最好当油菜开始现蕾时追肥一次，在苔高一尺左右时再施一次。施时结合进行中耕培土，清沟沥水，避免肥分流失和雨季渍水，影响油菜后期生长。
    油菜盛花阶段，在叶面喷磷肥，对油菜开花到顶，促使粒多、粒重有重大作用。一般每亩可用过磷酸钙二至四斤兑水一百至二百斤，经过过滤将溶液用喷雾器喷射在叶面上。每隔三、五天喷射一次，共喷二至三次，即可收到增产的效果。喷磷时如每百斤水掺入硼酸四至五钱，可使油菜根、茎、叶里面的养分迅速输送到种子中去，增加籽实重量。
    从近年来许多丰产经验看，争取油菜“枝多、荚多、粒多、粒重”的另一重要措施是打黄叶和摘顶心，保证荚果不受春寒和病害的影响。今年湖南部分早播的油菜，冬前生长比较旺盛，但有少数叶片已经变黄。这些黄叶多在基部，影响下部通风透光。同时由于地面长期荫蔽多湿，又有利于油菜菌核病和霜霉病菌丝体的发展。这些病菌孢子发芽后，最先为害生命力较弱的黄叶，接着将继续侵害好的叶片和茎秆，严重的使整株失收。因此在初春，要普遍进行一次清洁田园的工作，把黄叶、杂草全部清除干净。
    油菜是异花授粉的作物，开花时要靠昆虫和风力传播花粉，如果气候条件不好，就会授粉不全，影响荚多粒多。据湖南省农业科学研究所观察，一般油菜结荚数只占开花总数的70％左右，低的只有40％到50％，因而严重影响油菜的单位产量。为了提高油菜的结实率，争取95％以上的花朵都能结实，要大力提倡养蜂，在田间设置蜂箱，加强蜜蜂传粉的作用。蜜蜂少的地区还可以推行人工辅助授粉，用竹竿或绳索（最好用被单或长手巾接连起来）在晴天露水将干时在油菜花上轻轻拖动，如此进行三至四次，可增加授粉机会，提高结实率，达到增产的目的。
    对于油菜病虫害必须主动进行预防，以保证油菜不受损害。防治方法除开沟排水、苔期中耕、摘除黄叶等措施外，自2月底开始要注意田间检查。发现霜霉病，可以喷射1∶1∶200波尔多液，每亩用量一百五十至二百斤，每十天左右喷射一次。喷射次数依病情而定，如同时发生虫害，可用波尔多液与六六六混合进行兼治，并注意随混合随施用。对油菜菌核病要在结荚初期当气温达到摄氏二十度以上，多雨过湿时勤加检查，在发病初期及时喷撒1∶15赛力散消石灰粉，每亩用量十斤左右。对于毒素病的防治，主要抓住根治蚜虫。用1∶200—300倍液的可湿性六六六或五十倍的烟草肥皂水在苗期多次喷射，可以彻底消灭蚜虫。
