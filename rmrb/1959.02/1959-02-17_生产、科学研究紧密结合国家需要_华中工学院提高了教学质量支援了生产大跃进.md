Production and Scientific Research Closely Integrated with National Needs
Huazhong Institute of Technology Improves Teaching Quality and Supports the Great Leap Forward in Production

    (Our report) Wuhan - Teachers and students of various departments of Huazhong Institute of Technology, closely integrating their majors, facing local industrial production, actively carry out scientific research and production activities to support the leap-forward development of industrial and agricultural production this year.
    Currently, more than 200 relatively large scientific research projects are underway at this school, with over 1,000 teachers and students participating in this activity. The vast majority of these research projects are proposed according to the urgent needs of industrial and agricultural production and are carried out in close collaboration with factories and enterprises. In order to support the realization of electrification and mechanization in rural areas, the school has established a comprehensive cooperative relationship with relevant departments in Jingshan County, Hubei Province. In the previous period, some teachers and students had gone to the county to conduct investigations and research, discussed with workers and peasants, formulated the county's industrial development plan, and assisted the county in gradually establishing factories and hydropower stations, training a group of technical cadres, and trial-producing various native gantry planers, native lathes, native milling machines, and other machinery and equipment. The complete sets of native electrical appliances successfully trial-produced by teachers and students not long ago are planned to be widely promoted in Jingshan County. The various departments of the school, in conjunction with their majors, have respectively established cooperative relationships with dozens of factories such as Daye Steel Plant, Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, and Wuhan Motor Manufacturing Plant. They are currently helping the factories to study and solve problems existing in production and promote the latest modern production technologies. Teachers and students are also working hard in the school's factories to support local industry. Teachers, students, and workers in the Department of Comprehensive Mechanical Engineering are to complete the production and installation of 150 Model 1617 precision lathes in the near future so that the machines can be delivered to local industrial departments as soon as possible; the Comprehensive Motor Factory produced more than 500 small motors and 2,000 broadcast intercoms to support rural power undertakings. Various departments have also sent technical guidance groups and work teams to various districts and counties to help newly built factories solve production technology problems.
    These scientific research and production activities are carried out under the leadership of the school's Party committee, with teachers, students, and workers closely integrated. The Department of Mechanical Engineering is to produce 150 lathes in more than two months. The Party committee secretary often personally goes to the factory to direct production, and the Party committee deputy secretary goes to factories outside the school to solve the problem of raw material supply and transportation. In various research activities and production labor, teachers and students not only conduct theoretical discussions in factories and laboratories but also engage in basic technological operations such as carpentry, fitting, and electrical work. Teachers, students, and workers are closely integrated, learning from each other's strengths to make up for weaknesses. Teachers often give enlightening reports in conjunction with production or conduct on-site teaching to help students and workers master basic principles. Teachers and students also humbly learn from workers, gradually mastering various production skills. Due to the close integration of teachers, students, and workers, various scientific research and production labor have achieved great results. The Department of Mechanical Engineering had only produced ten belt lathes since its establishment, but now it produces 150 lathes in more than two months, and the quality meets national standards.
    The various scientific research and production labor carried out by Huazhong Institute of Technology not only take into account the needs of national and local industrial production but are also closely integrated with majors. Therefore, they not only support the Great Leap Forward in industrial production but also improve teaching quality. The sixteen types of native electrical appliances successfully trial-produced by the Department of Electrical Engineering use wood and iron sheets instead of silicon steel sheets and copper, and the production method is very simple, which will promote rural electrification. The 150 lathes produced by teachers and students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering in more than two months account for more than 4% of the total lathe production in Wuhan last year, and some of the lathes have been successively transported to various parts of Hubei. These activities have enriched teaching content and improved teaching quality. When the Department of Thermal Energy and Power cooperated with factories to research and design a boiler equipment, with the help of workers and engineering technicians, they supplemented the content of the boiler course, and students have consolidated the theory and professional knowledge they learned through actual production labor.
    Since April last year, this school has begun to face local industry, carry out scientific research and production labor, completed more than 500 relatively major scientific research projects, solved more than 4,000 production technology problems for local industry, established regular cooperative relationships with nearly 100 factories, and also used school factories and laboratories to produce more than 100 kinds of industrial products, which not only supported local industry but also played a good role in cultivating teachers' and students' ability to combine theory with practice and improve teaching. At the beginning of this year, Huazhong Institute of Technology summarized the achievements of teaching, production labor, and scientific research in the past year, and all teachers and students of the school are determined to more comprehensively implement the Party's education policy and continue to vigorously support the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production this year.

    生产、科学研究紧密结合国家需要
    华中工学院提高了教学质量支援了生产大跃进
    本报讯　华中工学院各系师生紧密结合专业，面向地方工业生产，积极开展科学研究和生产活动，支援今年工农业生产的飞跃发展。
    现在，这个学校有二百多个比较大的科学研究项目正在进行，参加这一活动的有一千多位师生。这些研究项目绝大部分都是根据工农业生产的迫切需要提出来的，是与工厂企业紧密协作进行的。为了支援农村实现电气化、机械化，这个学校同湖北京山县有关部门建立了全面协作的关系。前一时期，一部分师生已到这个县进行调查研究，和工人农民一起讨论，制订出全县工业发展规划，并且协助这个县逐步建立工厂和水电站，培养一批技术干部，试制各种土龙门刨床、土车床、土铣床等机器设备。不久前师生们试制成功的成套土电器，准备在京山县普遍推广。这个学校各个系结合专业，已分别同大冶钢厂、武汉重型机床厂、武汉电机制造厂等数十个工厂建立了协作关系，目前正帮助各厂研究和解决生产中存在的问题，并推广现代最新生产技术。师生们为了支援地方工业也在校内的工厂里紧张地劳动着。综合机械系教师、学生和工人要在最近完成一百五十台一六一七式精密车床的生产和安装工作，以便尽快地把机器送到地方工业部门去；综合电机厂生产了五百多台小型电动机和两千个广播通话器，支援农村电力事业。各系还先
  后派出技术辅导团和工作组到各专区和县，帮助新建工厂解决生产技术问题。
    这些科学研究和生产活动，都是在学校党委领导下，教师、学生和工人紧密结合进行的。机械系要在两个多月内生产一百五十台车床，党委书记经常亲临工厂指挥生产，党委副书记到校外工厂解决原材料供应和运输问题。在各项研究活动和生产劳动中，教师学生在工厂和实验室，不仅进行理论探讨，也从事木工、钳工、电工等基本工艺操作，教师、学生、工人紧密结合，互相取长补短，教师经常结合生产作启发性报告或进行现场教学，帮助学生和工人掌握基本原理，教师和学生也虚心向工人学习，逐步掌握各种生产技能。由于教师、学生、工人紧密结合，使各项科学研究和生产劳动取得巨大成绩。机械系从建校以来只生产过十部皮带车床，现在两个多月就生产一百五十台车床，质量合乎国家标准。
    华中工学院进行的各项科学研究和生产劳动，既考虑到国家和地方工业生产的需要，也紧密结合专业，因此既支援了工业生产大跃进，又提高了教学质量。电机系试制成功的十六种土电器，用木材、铁片代替矽钢片和铜，制作方法十分简单，对农村电气化将起促进作用。机械系师生两个多月生产一百五十台车床，占武汉市去年一年车床生产总数的4％以上，现在已有部分车床陆续运往湖北各地。通过这些活动，丰富了教学内容，提高了教学质量。热能动力系在与工厂协作研究设计一种锅炉设备时，在工人和工程技术人员帮助下，补充了锅炉课程的内容，学生们通过实际生产劳动，学习的理论和专业知识更加巩固了。
    从去年4月起，这个学校就开始面向地方工业，开展了科学研究和生产劳动，完成了五百多个比较重大的科学研究项目，为地方工业解决了四千多个生产技术问题，同近百个工厂建立了经常的协作关系，还利用校内工厂和实验室，生产了一百多种工业产品，这不仅支援了地方工业，而且对培养师生理论联系实际和改进教学也起了良好的作用。今年年初，华中工学院总结了一年来的教学、生产劳动和科学研究的成绩，全院师生决心更全面地贯彻党的教育方针，继续大力支援今年工农业生产大跃进。　（殷平）
