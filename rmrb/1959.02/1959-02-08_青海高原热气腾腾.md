    Qinghai Plateau is Steaming with Enthusiasm

    Xining, February 7th (by our own correspondent) - On the Qinghai Plateau, where snowflakes are dancing on the eve of the Spring Festival, a world-shaking labor scene has emerged.

    In the Dongfeng People's Commune on the outskirts of Xining City, the gong for starting work rang out everywhere just after the clock struck five. The sound of people bustling about, the jingling of bells on horse-drawn carts, and groups of vigorous figures poured into the fields. People started working as soon as they arrived at the construction site, in groups of two or three, starting fires to smoke the soil. In an instant, puffs of white smoke rose from the ground, like a thick fog spreading in the spring morning. At the edge of the field, a long line of horse-drawn and mule-drawn carts sped past, and people were busy transporting 100,000 catties of fertilizer to the fields.

    As soon as the morning gong stopped, the carpentry team also got up to rush to make vehicles for the fertilizer transport team. In the past two months, they have made more than 100 large and small carts, increasing the efficiency of fertilizer transportation by four or five times. The cooks are busy preparing meals for the transport team who have just returned from the city with manure. After settling down the cart drivers and feeding them, they continued to arrange breakfast for the heroes on the fertilizer accumulation and delivery battlefield.

    The sun came out, and on the outskirts of Xining City, the white snow, red flags, the dust from pounding dirt and the smoke from smoking fertilizer swirled and dissipated in the sky, the morning glow dyed like rosy clouds, it was a sea of smoke, and also a boiling sea of labor.

    青海高原热气腾腾
    本报西宁7日电　春节前夕雪花飞舞的青海高原上出现了惊天动地的劳动场面。
    在西宁市郊东风人民公社里，时钟刚刚敲过了五下，上工的锣声就四处唱起来了。人声熙攘，马车上铜铃当当，一群一群矫健的身影涌向地里。人们到了工地就干起来了，三三两两一组，开始点火熏土，刹时间，平地腾起一朵一朵的白烟，像春晨弥漫的浓雾。地头上，一长溜马车、骡车飞驰过来，人们在开始忙碌着把十万斤肥料运到地里。
    早上的锣声刚息，木工组也起来为运肥队赶制车辆，最近两个月他们制大、小车一百多辆，使运肥效率提高四、五倍。炊事员们正忙碌着为刚从城里拉粪回来的运输队作饭。刚刚安顿赶车的人们吃了饭，又接着为积肥、送肥战场上的英雄安排早餐了。
    太阳出来了，在西宁市郊的原野上白雪红旗，打灰的尘土和熏肥的烟雾，在天空缭绕、飘散，朝霞染得像彤云一样，是烟雾的海洋，也是劳动的沸腾的海洋。
