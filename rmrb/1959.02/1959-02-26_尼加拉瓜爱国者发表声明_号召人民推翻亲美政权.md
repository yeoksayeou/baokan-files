Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, 25th - The "Nicaraguan Patriots Association," established in Venezuela, recently issued a statement calling on the Nicaraguan people to unite and overthrow the pro-American Nicaraguan regime of Luis Somoza in commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the assassination of national hero Sandino.

The statement said that Sandino was the leader of the Nicaraguan people's opposition to imperialist rule and was assassinated by thugs loyal to foreign investors and the American policy of aggression, under Anastasio Somoza (the father of the current Nicaraguan president). The statement pointed out that Anastasio Somoza's tyranny exists entirely as a result of blatant American interference. The statement called on all Nicaraguan people to eliminate ideological differences and make the greatest effort to unite in struggle in order to regain the democratic freedom and national sovereignty for which Sandino fought.

Another report says that the Caracas City Council recently decided to erect a bronze monument on a street named after Sandino to commemorate this national hero. The Municipal Council also issued a statement supporting the Nicaraguan people's struggle against imperialist interventionists. The statement said that Sandino's struggle against North American armed intervention "represents the common sentiment of the vast majority of Latin Americans." (Picture attached)

    尼加拉瓜爱国者发表声明
    号召人民推翻亲美政权
    新华社25日讯　加拉加斯消息：在委内瑞拉成立的“尼加拉瓜爱国者协会”最近发表一项声明，号召尼加拉瓜人民团结一致推翻亲美的尼加拉瓜路易斯·索摩查政权，以纪念民族英雄桑地诺被刺身死第二十五周年。
    声明说，桑地诺是尼加拉瓜人民反对帝国主义统治的领袖，他是被效忠于外国投资家和美国侵略政策的安纳斯塔肖·索摩查（现任尼加拉瓜总统的父亲）的匪徒们刺杀的。声明指出，安纳斯塔肖·索摩查的暴政之所以能够存在，完全是美国横蛮干涉的结果。声明号召全体尼加拉瓜人民消除意识形态上的分歧，作最大的努力进行联合斗争以便重新取得桑地诺为之而战的民主自由和国家主权。
    另有消息说，加拉加斯市议会最近决定在以桑地诺命名的一条大街上树立铜碑来纪念这位民族英雄。市政议会还发表声明支持尼加拉瓜人民反对帝国主义干涉者的斗争。声明说，桑地诺反对北美武装干涉的斗争“代表了拉丁美洲绝大多数人的共同情绪”。（附图片）
