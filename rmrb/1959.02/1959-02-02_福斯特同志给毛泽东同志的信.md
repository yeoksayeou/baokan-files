    "Red Flag" Magazine Editor's Note: Comrade Foster, Honorary Chairman of the Communist Party of the United States, sent a letter to Comrade Mao Zedong on December 19, 1958. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote a reply to Comrade Foster on January 17, 1959. The letter stated: "Thank you very much for your letter of December 19, 1958. From your passionate letter, I see the soul of the great American Communist Party, the soul of the great American working class and the American people. The Chinese people understand that American imperialism has done many bad things to China and to the whole world. It is only the American ruling clique that is bad; the American people are very good. Among the Americans, although many have not yet awakened, the bad people are only a small minority, and the vast majority are good people. The friendly relations between the Chinese and American people will eventually break through the obstacles of the Dulles clique and develop more and more widely. Although the Communist Party of the United States is temporarily in a difficult position, your struggle is very meaningful and will surely bear fruitful results in the future. The night has an end. The American reactionary forces are now running into walls everywhere, showing that their lifespan will not be long. The current situation of the enemy being strong and us being weak in your country is only a temporary phenomenon, and it will definitely change in the opposite direction. Please allow me to extend my heartfelt greetings to you—a glorious fighter and leader of the American working class—on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, and wish you a speedy recovery. If it is possible, I warmly welcome you to come to China for medical treatment and recuperation." The following is a translation of Comrade Foster's letter.
    Chairman Mao Zedong of the Communist Party of China
    Dear Comrade, Dear Friend:
    Let me most sincerely congratulate the great Chinese people and their Communist Party through you, and congratulate you on the glorious victory of the great revolution, which is inspiring the whole world. I regret that I cannot visit your country in person, therefore, I take this opportunity to express my congratulations through this letter. I am seventy-eight years old; I have been unable to leave my house for fourteen months due to a paralytic stroke; and I am bound by two misdemeanor charges, each of which could carry a sentence of five to ten years in prison. Therefore, my hope of coming to revolutionary China is rather small, although I have not given up trying to obtain a passport to visit socialist countries. By the way, I hope to receive better treatment in these countries than I could receive in the United States.
    The Chinese people, mainly workers, have played a significant role in the history of the western region of the United States, as you undoubtedly know. They began to migrate to this region in the early 1850s, at the height of the famous California gold rush. In the decades since then, they have worked in all the mines, forests, ranches and construction sites in the western United States. They built the main railways of California. In particular, they laid the western half of the first transcontinental "Central Pacific Railroad" in the United States in the late 1860s, a heroic achievement. In the 1880s, they had to fight against chauvinism, threats, intimidation and violence that culminated in the passage of the "Exclusion Act." The strict enforcement of this law almost completely prohibited Asian immigration. This is the typical way American capitalists treat ethnic minorities, and the most abused are those with different skin colors, such as American Indians, blacks, Japanese, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Filipinos, and so on. In the early days of immigration, as many as 100,000 Chinese came to the United States each year. Now, despite the government's policy of strict restrictions, there are still about 118,000 Chinese in the United States. In major cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, and New York, there are small Chinatowns, some of which have the characteristics of Chinese architecture and customs. As you know, these masses are deeply inspired by the Chinese revolution.
    The large monopoly capital that manipulates the U.S. imperialist government is pursuing a violent policy of intimidation, attempting to strangle the Chinese revolution and obstruct the Chinese people from expanding their heroic achievements in building socialism and communism. As an American worker, I am ashamed of this policy. The fact that the United States is trying to force China to obey U.S. orders in the Taiwan Strait and is supporting the Chiang Kai-shek gang in every way shows the true face of a barbaric imperialism. Until recently, this imperialism was rampant everywhere in Asia, Africa and Latin America. But now, because the Chinese people, the Indian people, the African people and the Latin American people have risen up in these regions, this imperialism is rapidly approaching its end.
    How arrogant it is for the American imperialists to insist on pushing their current policy toward China. If any strong country tried to inflict on the American imperialists themselves the atrocities that the American imperialists are now inflicting on the People's China every day, they would shout out in rage. They send warships to the Chinese coast; they attempt to bomb, seize and occupy Chinese cities; they impose unprecedented economic blockades; they attempt to prevent the Chinese people from having due representation in the United Nations; they constantly threaten the Chinese people, who are heroically struggling to get rid of the poverty and suffering caused by the tyranny and oppression of the past, with imperialist war.
    But the strength of the Chinese people is growing rapidly, and they can laugh at the posturing of this "paper tiger." They know that U.S. blockades and war threats cannot stop the growth of Chinese socialism. The imperialists know especially that they are powerless to oppose the international solidarity of the socialist world, headed by the Soviet Union and with the People's China as an important component. The great China is developing irresistibly, and all the forces of world imperialism cannot stop it. Before long, the United States will find itself in a completely untenable position in its relations with the People's China. It must retreat. It has begun to realize that its counter-revolutionary policy toward China, which it has pursued until now, is fraught with disaster for itself. Throughout the United States, there is a strong and deepening resentment against the anti-China policies of Eisenhower, Dulles, and Truman. There is no doubt that this was a powerful factor in the decisive political defeat suffered by the Eisenhower Republicans in the November 1958 elections. There is a growing belief that unless these policies are reversed, the result will be disastrous for the United States. There are now a large number of Americans, not only workers, but also a considerable proportion of other classes of people, who realize that the United States is grabbing the tail of the unconquerable Chinese dragon, and the sooner it lets go, the better for the United States.
    The regrettable situation is that the American working class is not resisting this imperialist behavior of bullying the Chinese people enough. But, as you know, the important trade unions in the United States are led by people who have no socialist ideas, and who have not even established a Labor Party. They are often as fanatical warmongers as the capitalists. They have a very weak concept of international solidarity, especially of international solidarity with the people of socialist countries and the people suffering from imperialist oppression. But, during the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, the American progressive workers, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the United States, and in the face of unprecedented oppression by the government, launched a powerful resistance. The prestige of the People's China is constantly and rapidly rising in the United States. American public opinion is in a constant state of amazement at the revolutionary achievements of the Chinese people.
    In the past generation or so, the great event that has shocked the world is the rapid development of Soviet socialism. Since the early days of the revolution, I have visited the Soviet Union thirteen times, and I have been fortunate to observe the development of this revolution at close range. Now, there is that magnificent Seven-Year Plan, which will inevitably promote the world socialist cause to an unprecedented extent. It is a great joy and encouragement to see socialist countries catching up with capitalist countries one after another. In particular, Lenin's slogan about the Soviet Union "catching up with and surpassing" the United States is being realized. The significance of this situation is clear to all. This situation means that the new socialist world has defeated the old capitalist world. The Soviet Union is illuminating the path forward for the world economically, theoretically and culturally. Those capitalists who are not completely blinded by ignorance and hatred are increasingly beginning to recognize this.
    Now there is also the People's China, whose incredible development in all aspects of construction has shocked the world. Its long twenty-five years of arduous civil war and anti-imperialist war are bearing the fruit of glorious socialist development. I must say that I am not only excited, but truly and deeply delighted by the great progress that China has already made. China's current Great Leap Forward is truly full of dazzling industrial and agricultural achievements. The prospect of China, which was said to be decadent and hopeless for so many years, is now radiant and will surpass Britain, once a prominent leader in the capitalist world, in just a few years. The revolutionary implications of this prospect are simply overwhelming. I am particularly interested in the new People's Communes that are being established across the country with China's usual lightning speed. This will undoubtedly further accelerate the extremely rapid pace of development of the Chinese revolution. The miracle of the People's Communes is also matched by the remarkable mass movements of the Chinese people in steelmaking, the chemical industry, agriculture, and so on. For those who grew up in a capitalist industrial country like the United States, where industry is highly concentrated in vast factories, it is hard to believe that the Chinese people can carry out such massive industrial construction with such small production units. But, unless I am completely mistaken, these small units will accelerate, rather than hinder, the development of the largest and most efficient factories. It is hard to imagine how far China will have progressed when the historically significant Soviet Seven-Year Plan is completed. After so many years of being plundered and devastated by its own exploiters and foreign imperialists, the Chinese people are now building socialism with such a high degree of enthusiasm. It is hard to say whether the American people understand, even vaguely, the great events that are currently taking place in China's socialistization process, and even the beginning of communization.
    The United States is watching with hostile eyes, although it does not understand what it sees. Its hatred of the People's China is notorious, even though the American people as a whole have kind feelings for the Chinese masses. But the dominant imperialists are using every possible means to defeat China and stop its industrial development. This hatred is, at its core, a genuine fear. The imperialists who own and rule the United States know very well that since they have already failed to dominate the world in the face of the heroic Soviet Union, then, when they have to deal with the People's China in addition to the Soviet Union, and the power of the People's China will double or triple in a few more years, they will find it doubly impossible to dominate the world. The continuous development of the Soviet Union and the People's China not only means the strengthening of these two countries themselves, but also the strengthening of the world socialist cause. It was already extremely foolish for the U.S. imperialists and their lackey Chiang Kai-shek to think that they could overthrow the People's China with external aggression, and it is even more foolish for them to believe that the rapidly developing China can be overthrown by internal rebellion.
    I believe that the socialist countries united are already much stronger than the imperialist countries united. Perhaps the clearest indication of this is the fact that in the past decade, the socialist countries have been able to prevent the world war that the imperialist countries have been一心想 trying to launch during this period. The U.S. imperialists saw that after World War II, the United States was not scarred by the war, that they had a monopoly on the atomic bomb, and that their industrial and military machine had greatly expanded, while almost all the socialist countries, including the Soviet Union and China, were severely damaged by World War II. Without a doubt, they thought that they could easily defeat socialism and establish U.S. imperialist control throughout the world. But their hopes were completely dashed. The revolutionary people, not only in China, Korea, and Indochina, have driven the imperialist troops led by the United States back step by step, and have established their own powerful military forces; and most importantly, they have broken the U.S. monopoly on the atomic bomb.
    In general, the revolutionary people have made it very difficult for the imperialists to launch the world war they desire. In such a war, the imperialists cannot win in any case; all they can get is the destruction of the capitalist system and the expansion of the world socialist cause. Even so, the imperialists could still cause serious damage to the world. As the basic force for world peace, the people of socialist countries must prevent this at all costs. The decisive defeat of the imperialists at the 1955 Geneva "Summit" has already been revealed. I believe that this defeat is fundamental to the capitalist system. In my opinion, the task of the revolutionary forces around the world now is to promote the development of the world socialist cause, while also tying up the capitalist warmongers. It must be admitted that this is an extremely difficult task. But, for the capitalist system, this is a fatal process. Peaceful coexistence must be won through heroic struggle.
    The general crisis of capitalism is deepening. All the major capitalist countries are sick, and getting sicker, despite their war-nurtured prosperity and Keynesian policies aimed at dealing with periodic economic crises. In the United States, nearly four million people are now unemployed, and the entire economic system is tottering. There is real pessimism and confusion in the ranks of the capitalists, especially after the launch of the Soviet artificial satellites and the sensation caused here by the Soviet education system and scientific progress. The imperialists have never been so deeply shocked by the progress of the Soviet Union as they are now. They know full well that they and their partners cannot manipulate the world now. They dare not even imagine what the situation will become once the People's China is truly proceeding at full speed in terms of economic, political, and cultural development. No wonder churches are growing so fast; capitalism is increasingly relying on prayer to save itself.
    According to the current situation, and even more so in the future, the socialist countries and their allies have the main responsibility of leading the world. While implementing their own constructive socialist programs, they certainly have the responsibility to save the world from the disasters caused by the dying capitalist system. They must prevent imperialist wars; they must stop capitalism from destroying world progress; they must save mankind from the disasters repeatedly caused by economic crises. They must defend the socialist countries and the anti-colonial countries; they must promote the industrialization of underdeveloped countries; they must make the world more civilized in many ways; they must combine the various tasks of the world socialist cause to protect the people and make them progress. They must overcome modern capitalist epidemics that harm mankind, such as mental illness, degenerative physical diseases, crime, juvenile delinquency, and so on.
    In recent years, the world's socialist forces and their tasks have become more and more complex, yet also simpler. The socialist revolution is advancing through three main currents: first, the true socialist countries, which have political power, the leadership of the Communist Party, and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism—they are the true leaders of the revolution. Second, there are many anti-colonial countries that have broken away from imperialism; they are not as clear-sighted revolutionaries as the first type of countries, but they are essentially mainly anti-imperialist, and their masses are clearly politically linked to the socialist countries rather than the imperialist countries. Third, there are mass democratic organizations in capitalist countries, such as various workers' parties, trade unions, cooperatives, women's and youth organizations, peasant movements, ethnic groups, and so on, totaling millions of people. These democratic organizations are often led by opportunists and have pro-capitalist programs. They cannot be easily regarded as an important part of the revolutionary movement, which is often overlooked. Although their leaders are often counter-revolutionary, their masses, from their history and daily struggles, are fundamentally part of the revolutionary movement. They reflect the degree of revolution in imperialist-capitalist countries. The true socialist movement in the world should recognize this fact more clearly and guide its actions more clearly with this fact. We must give practical leadership to all these three major revolutionary forces or potential revolutionary forces, regardless of how different their current problems, leaders, programs, and struggle tactics may be.
    At least until now, the United States is one of the most difficult regions in the world to build a socialist movement. Its difficulties, for example, are very different from those of China. The American labor movement, in some of its aspects, such as local labor newspapers, local labor parties, etc., dates back to the American Revolution of 1776. It has almost as long a history as the British labor movement, or even longer. I myself grew up almost entirely in the labor movement. I first participated in a strike in 1893; I joined the Socialist Party in 1900; became a syndicalist in 1909; and joined the Communist Party in early 1921. The first Marxists in the United States (German immigrants, many of whom had worked with Marx and Engels) appeared in the 1850s. The first Socialist Party in the United States was founded in 1876. During this long period, the United States was known for its intense class struggle. Many of the most arduous strike struggles in the history of the world's industrial countries have occurred in the United States. The American working class, composed of many races and nationalities, has repeatedly demonstrated its outstanding fighting qualities.
    At this very time, the bourgeoisie has built a powerful and brutal organization. They own about half of the capitalist world's output, they have reached the point of controlling a large part of the capitalist world, they have built a vast capitalist system; if they had the power to do so, they would still want to rule the world, including the socialist world and the capitalist world. But their power has its limits. Despite their vast wealth and power, they cannot bring the socialist forces of the world under their control. Their fatal weakness lies here, and this will eventually lead to their demise.
    In this harsh environment, American workers and their allies have not been able to build a strong revolutionary movement. It is true that they have built a trade union movement with 18 million members amidst countless difficulties; 18 million black people are the most combative part of the American working class and have powerful organizations; there are also powerful peasant movements; there are also youth and women's movements, and so on. Although the leadership of these organizations is unreliable, and the capitalists are implementing various imperialist policies of corruption and bribery, these organized millions can exert power and have a great influence on the course of the United States.
    But their ideological work is not as good as their organizational work. Marx's socialist ideas are very weak among them; their main idea (which is instilled in them by the extremely powerful capitalist propaganda machine) is a chaotic Roosevelt-style Keynesianism (which capitalist theorists call "people's capitalism"). The situation has become increasingly worse because U.S. imperialism has achieved enormous development by placing other capitalist countries and underdeveloped countries in a semi-subservient position. Thus, fifty years ago, about one-quarter of the trade union movement openly supported Marxism; and now, if there are one-tenth (in some unions outside the AFL-CIO), it is probably saying too much. There is no Labor Party in the United States, and the workers do not have their own other mass political organizations. If they participate in political activities, the vast majority follow the two old bourgeois parties, which are also manipulated by monopoly capitalists, mainly the Democratic Party. Several left-wing parties are very weak. Apart from a small group of only three or four thousand people, there is no social democratic party. The Trotskyists are also a very small group, even more insignificant; the Socialist Labor Party (De Leonists) is also just a very small faction. In the recent elections, the Democratic Party received at least 40 million votes, which should have been cast for a People's Front party; the five left-wing parties together received less than 100,000 votes nationwide.
    From the defects of the American labor movement explained above, it seems almost impossible for this country to open a path to socialism. But it would be a mistake to underestimate the American working class. Although they are currently performing poorly at a time when U.S. imperialism is rampant, the American working class has excellent fighting traditions. In addition, there is a new factor that we should not ignore, which is the impact of international democratic and socialist forces on the situation in the United States. This has great significance for the American working people in many ways. For example, in the case of black people, the strong democratic influence in the world has obviously forced American capitalists to make major changes in the brutal system of racial discrimination that they have imposed on black people for hundreds of years. Thus, in the U.S. Army, the government has been forced to abolish the segregation system of dividing the army into white and black regiments, because it cannot send that segregated army outside the United States without being severely condemned.
    Similarly, due to democratic pressure from abroad, the United States has been forced to legally abolish its white-only schools, hotels, buses, etc., and at least formally stipulate that they must accommodate black people. Of course, every effort is always made to circumvent this law. The United States has also been forced to restrain the lynching of black people, which was a common and terrible phenomenon not long ago. This external pressure in favor of black people is a major factor in the American class struggle. Similarly, the U.S. imperialists have been forced to at least alleviate some of the arbitrary exploitation and barbaric oppression of white workers that used to be commonplace, such as Ku Klux Klan activities, McCarthyism, and the like. We can be sure that these external democratic influences will become more and more widespread and more and more powerful. There is no doubt that international democratic pressure gave considerable help to the American workers in their recent domestic defeat of aggressive McCarthyism. The American imperialists will find that in order to maintain their barbaric system in the United States, they will not only be opposed by the American labor forces, but also increasingly opposed throughout the world. If the United States allows these atrocities to continue unchecked, then it will be difficult for it to effectively pose as the leader of the "democratic" world.
    Since its founding, the Communist Party of the United States has been in a much better situation than any other left-wing party. Its membership is usually three to ten times the total membership of other left-wing parties, and its influence is much greater. This is because its theory and practice are based on Marxism-Leninism. Although we have made many mistakes, our party's influence among the masses is incomparably greater than that of other left-wing parties. In 1935, its membership reached about 80,000. Around this time, our party began to suffer a series of disasters, which were essentially the continuous attacks by brutal imperialism on the party. These disasters include: the CIO expelling eleven left-wing unions with about one million members in 1949; the leadership of Browder's revisionism within the party (which actually abolished the party), causing the party to lose about 15,000 members; the government and many union bosses conducting a frantic war propaganda, which had a detrimental effect on many party members; from 1948, the government began a long-term persecution of the party, including arresting and imprisoning many of the party's leaders, forcing the party to go almost completely underground, causing the party to lose several thousand members; the party made several mistakes, such as organizing the Progressive Party in 1948, which also caused us to lose several thousand members; the consequences of the cult of personality of Stalin severely damaged socialist propaganda in the United States; the corrosive effect of prolonged American prosperity and the resulting theories such as American exceptionalism had a toxic effect. Thus, the party experienced a serious revisionist crisis in 1955, which almost led to its destruction. The party lost several thousand more members. The current situation is that although our membership has been reduced to a very low number, our party is gradually recovering from the serious crisis it has experienced. Overall, the revisionists have been defeated. There is no doubt that U.S. imperialism, using its many agents, has always tried to destroy our party, but it has failed.
    The above can provide you with some practical information about the American situation, and also express my own admiration for the brilliant Chinese Communist Party under your leadership. I hope that, despite all the difficulties, I will one day be able to meet you and have a face-to-face chat with you. I am convinced that you must be in very good health. Please convey my heartfelt greetings to all your comrades.
                                Your Comrade

    P.S., I am very sorry that I cannot sign my name because my right hand is still paralyzed.

    福斯特同志给毛泽东同志的信
    “红旗”杂志编者按：美国共产党名誉主席福斯特同志在1958年12月19日寄给毛泽东同志一封信。毛泽东同志在1959年1月17日给福斯特同志写了回信。信中说：“十分感谢您1958年12月19日的来信。从您的充满热情的来信中，使我看到了伟大的美国共产党的灵魂，看到了伟大的美国工人阶级和美国人民的灵魂。“中国人民懂得，美国帝国主义对中国做了许多坏事，对全世界做了许多坏事，只是美国的统治集团不好，美国人民是很好的。在美国人中间，虽然有许多人现在还没有觉醒，但是坏人只是一小部分，绝大多数是好人。中国人民同美国人民之间的友好关系，终究会冲破杜勒斯之流的障碍，日益广泛地发展起来。“美国共产党虽然暂时还处于不大顺利的地位，但是你们的斗争是很有意义的，将来一定会结出丰硕的果实。黑夜是有尽头的。美国反动势力现已到处碰壁，显示着他们的寿命不会很长了。你们那里目前敌强我弱这种形势，完全是暂时的现象，它一定会向相反的方向起变化。“请允许我代表中国共产党和中国人民向您——美国工人阶级光荣的战士和领袖，致以衷心的问候，并祝您早日恢复健康。如果您有可能的话，我热诚地欢迎您到中国来医疗和休养。”以下就是福斯特同志的信的译文。
    中国共产党主席毛泽东
    亲爱的同志、亲爱的朋友：
    让我通过您最衷心地祝贺伟大的中国人民及其共产党，祝贺你们的巨大革命的辉煌胜利，这个胜利正在鼓舞着全世界。遗憾的是我不能亲自来访问你们的国家，因此，我利用这个机会，通过这封信来表达贺意。我七十八岁了；由于患了瘫痪性的中风，十四个月来一直出不了门；而且，我受着两起治安罪起诉的束缚，每一起可能判处五年到十年的徒刑。因此，我到革命的中国来的希望相当小了，虽然我并没有放弃努力，来争取一张护照，以便访问社会主义国家。顺便提一下，我希望在这些国家得到比我在美国所可能得到的更好的治疗。
    中国人，主要是工人，在美国西部地区的历史中，起过很大的作用，这一点您无疑是知道的了。他们开始移居到这个地区，是在十九世纪五十年代初期，正是加利福尼亚州有名的淘金热盛极一时的时候。从那时以后的几十年间，在美国西部所有的矿山、森林、牧场和工地里，都有他们在工作。他们修建了加利福尼亚州的主要铁路。特别是在十九世纪六十年代后期，铺修了美国第一条横贯大陆的“中太平洋铁路”的西半段，这是一个英雄的成就。在十九世纪八十年代，他们曾经不得不同在“排外法”被通过时达到极点的沙文主义、威胁恐吓和暴力行为进行斗争。这个法令严格执行的结果，几乎完全禁止了亚洲移民入境。这正是美国资本家一贯对待少数民族的特有做法，而最受虐待的是那些肤色不同的人，如美洲印第安人、黑人、日本人、波多黎各人、墨西哥人、菲律宾人等等。在移民的早期，到美国来的中国人一年达十万人之多。现在，尽管政府实施着严格限制的政策，美国还有十一万八千左右的中国人。在旧金山、洛杉矶、西雅图、芝加哥和纽约等主要的城市里，都有小块的华侨居住区，其中一些有着中国式建筑和习俗的特点。正如您所知道的，这些群众都是深深地为中国的革命所鼓舞的。
    操纵着美国帝国主义政府的大垄断资本实行着强暴的威吓政策，企图绞杀中国革命和阻挠中国人民扩大他们在建设社会主义和共产主义的事业中取得的英雄成就。作为一个美国工人，我对于这种政策感到耻辱。美国在台湾海峡试图强使中国听从美国的指挥，并且在各方面支持蒋介石匪帮，从这里可以看到一个野蛮帝国主义的真实面貌。直到最近，这个帝国主义还在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲到处横行。但是，现在由于在这些地区，中国人民、印度人民、非洲人民和拉丁美洲人民起来了，这个帝国主义正在迅速地接近它的末日。
    美帝国主义者硬要推行他们目前这种对中国的政策，这是多么的骄横。如果有任何一个强国，试图把美帝国主义者现在天天施加于人民中国的那种暴行，施加于美帝国主义者自己的港口和国家，他们就会狂怒地大叫起来。他们把军舰开到中国的海岸；他们企图轰炸、夺取和占领中国的城市；他们实行前所未有的经济封锁；他们企图阻止中国人民在联合国内有应有的代表权；他们经常把帝国主义战争的威胁加于正在为了摆脱过去的暴政和压迫所造成的贫困和痛苦而英勇斗争的中国人民。
    但是，中国人民的力量正在迅速壮大，他们能够对这个“纸老虎”的装腔作势付之一笑。他们知道，美国的封锁和战争威胁不可能阻挡中国社会主义的成长。帝国主义者尤其知道，他们要反对以苏联为首的、以人民中国为重要组成部分的社会主义世界的国际团结，是无能为力的。巨大的中国正在不可阻挡地发展着，世界帝国主义的一切力量都不能阻止它。不用很久，美国就会发现它自己在同人民中国的关系上处于完全站不住脚的地位。它必须退却。它已经开始认识到直到现在为止它对待中国的反革命政策，对它自己是充满着灾难的。在美国全国，有着一种强烈的和日益加深的愤慨，反对艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯—杜鲁门的反华政策。没有疑问，这是使艾森豪威尔共和党人在1958年11月选举中遭到决定性的政治失败的一个有力因素。人们日益增强的信念是，这些政策除非取消，否则其结果一定会使美国遭殃。现在已经有大批的美国人，不仅是工人，而且包括相当大部分其他阶级的人们，认识到美国抓住的是不可征服的中国巨龙的尾巴，对美国来说，越快放手越好。
    令人遗憾的情况是，对于欺侮中国人民的这种帝国主义行为，美国工人阶级反抗的程度是不够的。但是，正如您所知道的，美国的重要工会是由没有社会主义思想的人们领导的，这些人甚至连一个工党也没有建立起来。他们常常是像资本家一样疯狂的战争贩子。他们对于国际团结的观念，特别是对于社会主义国家的人民和遭受帝国主义压迫的人民的国际团结的观念，非常薄弱。但是，在1950年到1953年朝鲜战争期间，美国进步工人曾经在美国共产党领导之下，并且在政府空前的压迫的面前，发动了强大的反抗。人民中国的威信，在美国是不断地和迅速地上升着。美国的公众舆论，对于中国人民的革命成就，是处于不断感到惊异的状态中。
    在过去一个世代左右，震惊了全世界的伟大事件是苏联社会主义的迅速发展。自革命的初期以来，我访问过苏联十三次，我幸运地就近观察过这个革命的发展。现在，又有那辉煌壮丽的七年计划，它必然会空前地推动世界社会主义事业的前进。看到社会主义国家一个接一个地赶上了资本主义国家，真是令人感到极大的欢欣鼓舞。尤其是列宁关于苏联
  “赶上并超过”美国的口号正在实现中。这种情况的意义是所有的人都能清楚了解的。这种情况意味着社会主义的新世界战胜了资本主义的旧世界。苏联在经济上、理论上和文化上为全世界照耀着前进的道路。那些不是被无知和仇恨所完全蒙蔽了的资本家们，正在日益开始认识这一点了。
    现在又出现了人民中国，它在各方面建设中令人难以相信的发展，震惊了全世界。它的漫长的二十五年艰苦的内战和反帝战争，正在结出辉煌的社会主义发展的果实。我必须说，我对中国所已经取得的巨大发展，不仅感到兴奋，而且真正是万分地欢欣鼓舞。中国目前的大跃进，真是充满着令人眼花缭乱的工业成就和农业成就。中国的前景，过去多少年来据说是衰朽绝望的，现在是光芒万丈，在短短的几年之内将超过一度是资本主义世界突出的领袖的英国，这个前景的革命含义，简直是压倒一切的。我特别感到兴趣的是以中国常有的闪电般的速度在全国建立起来的新的人民公社。这无疑地将使中国革命发展的极快速度进一步加快。人民公社的奇迹又同中国人民在炼钢、化学工业、农业等方面了不起的群众运动相媲美。对于生长在像美国这样工业高度集中在庞大工厂里的资本主义工业国的人来说，中国人民能够用这么小的生产单位，来进行这么巨大的工业建设，是难以相信的。但是，除非我是完全想错了，这些小单位将会加速、而不是妨碍那些最大型的、效率最高的工厂的发展。当具有历史意义的苏联七年计划完成的时候，中国将前进得多远，那真是不容易想像的。中国人民被本国剥削者和外国帝国主义者掠夺和摧残了这么多年之后，现在正在以多么高度的热情建设着社会主义啊。很难说美国人民懂得，那怕是模糊地懂得，目前在中国的社会主义化过程中，甚至是开始共产主义化的过程中，所发生的巨大事件。
    美国以敌对的眼光注视着，虽然并不懂得所看到的东西，它对人民中国的仇恨是恶名昭著的，尽管整个地来说，美国人民对中国人民群众有善良的感情。但是，占统治地位的帝国主义者却在使用一切可能的手段来击败中国和阻止它的工业发展。这种仇恨，骨子里是真正的恐惧。占有和统治着美国的帝国主义者知道得很清楚，既然他们在英勇的苏联面前已经无法称霸世界，那末，当他们在应付苏联之外，还必须应付同苏联站在一起的人民中国，而人民中国的力量，再过几年，就会增强两倍或者三倍，他们就会感到称霸世界是加倍地不可能了。苏联和人民中国的不断发展，不仅仅意味着这两个国家本身的壮大，而且是世界社会主义事业的壮大。美帝国主义者和他们的走狗蒋介石，以为可以靠外部的进攻来推翻人民中国，这已经是愚不可及了，而他们竟相信迅速发展的中国可以用内部暴乱来推翻，那就更加是愚蠢到了极点。
    我认为，社会主义国家联合起来，已经是比帝国主义国家联合起来强大得多了。最明确地表明这一点的，也许是这个事实：在过去十年间，社会主义国家有能力防止帝国主义国家在这个时期一心想发动的世界大战。美帝国主义者看到，经过第二次世界大战，美国没有受到战争的创伤，他们垄断着原子弹，他们的工业和军事的机器大大地扩张，而几乎所有的社会主义国家，包括苏联和中国，都受到第二次世界大战的严重破坏，毫无疑问，他们就以为可以轻而易举地把社会主义打倒，并且在全世界建立美帝国主义的控制。但是他们的希望完全落空了。革命的人民，不仅是在中国、朝鲜和印度支那，把以美国为首的帝国主义军队打得寸步不前，而且建立起他们自己的强大的军事力量；而最重要的是，他们打破了美国对原子弹的垄断。
    总的来说，革命的人民使得帝国主义者非常难以发动他们所企求的世界大战。在这样的战争中，帝国主义者无论如何是不可能得胜的，他们所能得到的，只是资本主义制度的毁灭和世界社会主义事业的扩展。即使如此，帝国主义者还可能使世界受到严重的破坏。作为世界和平的基本力量，社会主义各国人民必须不惜一切代价加以制止。在1955年的日内瓦“最高级”会议上，帝国主义者的决定性失败已经显露出来了。我认为，这个失败对资本主义制度说来，是根本性的。据我看来，现在革命力量在全世界的任务是促进世界社会主义事业的发展，同时还要把资本主义战争贩子捆起来。应该承认，这是一个极端困难的任务。但是，对于资本主义制度，这是个致命的过程。和平共处必须用英勇的斗争来争取。
    资本主义总危机正在日益加深。所有的资本主义大国都病了，而且病得越来越重，尽管它们有靠战争养育的繁荣和旨在应付周期性经济危机的凯恩斯主义政策。在美国，现在已有近四百万人失业，整个经济制度摇摇晃晃。在资本家的行列中，存在着真正的悲观和混乱，特别是在苏联人造地球卫星发射以后和苏联教育制度和科学进步在这里引起轰动以后。帝国主义者对苏联的进步，从来没有像现在这样深深地感到震惊。他们清楚地晓得，他们和他们的伙伴们现在不能够操纵世界了。他们甚至不敢设想，一旦人民中国在经济、政治和文化的发展方面真正开足马力前进的时候，局势将变得怎样。难怪教堂增长得这么快；资本主义正在越来越指望用祷告来拯救自己了。
    依照目前情况来说，而且将来更会是如此，社会主义国家和它们的同盟者负有领导世界的主要责任。它们在贯彻自己的建设性的社会主义纲领的同时，肯定地有责任从垂死挣扎的资本主义所造成的灾难中拯救世界。它们必须防止帝国主义战争；它们必须阻止资本主义对世界进步的破坏；它们必须使人类免于经济危机所一再造成的灾难。它们必须捍卫社会主义国家和反殖民主义的国家；它们必须促使不发达的国家工业化；它们必须在许多方面使世界更加文明；它们必须结合世界社会主义事业的种种任务来保护人民，并且使他们进步。它们必须克服戕害人类的近代资本主义病疫，诸如精神病、退化性的生理疾病、犯罪、少年犯罪等等。
    近年来，世界社会主义力量和它们的任务越来越复杂，然而也更简单了。社会主义革命正通过三股主要的潮流前进：首先是真正的社会主义国家，它们拥有政权，有共产党的领导，有马克思列宁主义的指导——它们是革命的真正领导者。其次，有许多摆脱了帝国主义的反殖民主义国家；它们不是像第一类国家那样眼光清晰的革命主义者，但是，在本质上主要是反帝的，它们的人民群众在政治上是明显地同社会主义国家而不是同帝国主义国家联系起来的。第三，在资本主义国家里有群众性的民主组织，诸如工人的各种政党、工会、合作社、妇女和青年组织、农民运动、民族团体等等，共有千百万的人数。这些民主的组织往往是为机会主义者所领导，并且拥有亲资本主义的纲领，不可以轻易地把它们看作是革命运动的重要部分，而这一点是常常被人忽视的。尽管它们的领导常常是反革命的，但是，它们的群众，从它们的历史和日常斗争来看，却基本上是革命运动的一部分。它们反映着帝国主义—资本主义国家中革命的程度。世界上真正的社会主义运动应当更清楚地认识这个事实，并且更明确地以这个事实来指导自己的行动。我们必须对所有这三大股革命的力量或者潜在的革命力量给以切实的领导，不管它们当前的问题、领导、纲领和斗争策略有多大的不同。
    至少直到目前为止，美国是世界上建立社会主义运动最艰难的地区之一。它的困难，比方说，同中国比起来，是有很大的不同的。美国劳工运动，就它的某些方面来说，例如地方性的劳工报纸、地方性的劳工政党等等，溯源于1776年的美国革命时期，它和英国劳工运动有差不多同样久的历史，甚至更久一些。我自己几乎是在劳工运动中长大的。我第一次参加罢工是1893年；我在1900年参加了社会党；1909年成为工团主义者；在1921年初加入共产党。美国最初的马克思主义者（德国的移民，其中许多人和马克思、恩格斯在一起工作过）出现于十九世纪五十年代。美国的第一个社会党成立于1876年。在这个长时期中，美国是以阶级斗争激烈著称的。世界工业国历史上最艰苦的罢工斗争，许多是在美国发生的。由许多种族和民族组成的美国工人阶级，一次又一次地证明了自己的出色的斗争品质。
    就在这个时候，资产阶级建立起一个强有力的和残暴的组织。他们拥有资本主义世界产量的大约一半，他们达到了控制资本主义世界很大部分的地步，他们建立起庞大的资本主义体系；如果他们有力量做到的话，他们还想统治全世界，包括社会主义世界和资本主义世界。但是他们的力量是有最大限度的。尽管他们拥有那么大的财富和力量，但是，他们不能把世界上的社会主义力量置于他们的控制之下。他们的致命弱点也就在这里，这将终于导致他们的灭亡。
    在这种严酷的环境中，美国工人和他们的同盟者还没有能够建立起一个强有力的革命运动。诚然，他们已经在无数的困难中，建立起一个拥有一千八百万会员的工会运动；一千八百万黑人是美国工人阶级中最具有斗争性的部分，而且有强大的组织；还有强大的农民运动；也有青年运动和妇女运动，等等。尽管这些组织的领导是不可靠的，资本家又施行种种帝国主义的腐蚀和收买政策，但是这些有组织的千百万人能够发挥力量，对美国的进程起很大的影响。
    但是，他们的思想工作没有他们的组织工作做得好。马克思的社会主义思想在他们当中是非常微弱的；他们的主要思想（这是极强大的资本主义宣传机器灌输给他们的）是一种混乱的罗斯福式的凯恩斯主义（资本主义理论家称之为“人民资本主义”）。由于美帝国主义把其他资本主义国家和不发达的国家置于半屈服的地位，使自己取得巨大的发展，情况就越来越坏了。因此，五十年以前，工会运动约有四分之一是公开拥护马克思主义的；而现在，如果说有十分之一
  （在劳联—产联以外的一些工会），恐怕也是说多了。在美国没有工党，工人也没有自己的其他群众性的政治组织。如果参加政治活动的话，他们绝大多数是跟着同样为垄断资本家所操纵的两个老牌资产阶级政党走的，主要是跟着民主党走的。几个左翼政党都是非常弱小的。除了一个只有三、四千人的小团体外，并没有一个社会民主党。托洛茨基派也是一个非常小的团体，更加微不足道；社会劳工党（德里昂派）也只是一个很小的派别。在最近的选举中，民主党得了至少四千万张选票，这些选票照理是应该投给一个人民阵线的政党的；五个左翼政党在全国所得的票数合起来还不满十万。
    从上面所说明的美国劳工运动的缺陷来看，似乎这个国家几乎不可能打开一条走向社会主义的道路。但是，如果把美国工人阶级低估了，那将是个错误。尽管他们现在在美帝国主义横行一时的时候表现得差，但是美国工人阶级是有优良的斗争传统的。此外还出现了一个我们不应当忽视的新的因素，这就是国际民主力量和社会主义力量对美国局势的影响。这在许多方面都对美国劳动人民有重大的意义。例如，拿黑人的情况来说，世界上强烈的民主影响，显然已经迫使美国资本家把他们几百年来强加于黑人的残暴的种族歧视制度，作了重大的改变。这样，在美国陆军中，政府已经被迫废除了把军队分为白种兵团和黑种兵团的种族隔离制度，因为它不可能把那种实行种族隔离的军队派到美国以外的地方去而不受到严重的谴责。
    同样地，由于国外的民主压力，美国被迫在法律上取消它的只容纳白人的学校、旅馆、公共汽车等，至少在形式上规定要容纳黑人。当然，总是千方百计地来规避这种法律。美国也被迫约束了对黑人的私刑杀害，不久以前这还是常见的可怕现象。这种有利于黑人的外来压力，是美国阶级斗争中一个重大的因素。同样地，美帝国主义者已经被迫至少缓和一些从前一直是习以为常的对白种工人的肆意剥削和野蛮压迫，如三K党活动、麦卡锡主义之类。我们可以肯定，这些外来的民主影响将会越来越广泛，越来越有力。毫无疑问，国际上的民主压力对于美国工人最近在国内击败咄咄逼人的麦卡锡主义，给予了相当大的帮助。美国的帝国主义者将会发现，要在美国维持他们的野蛮制度，他们就不但要遭到美国劳工力量的反对，而且越来越在全世界范围内遭到反对。如果美国让这种暴行无所顾忌地继续下去，那么，它就很难有效地装出“民主”世界领袖的姿态。
    美国共产党自从建党以来，比任何左翼党派的情况都好得多。它的党员人数通常是其他左翼党派党员总数的三倍到十倍，它的影响也大得多。这是因为它的理论和实践都是以马克思列宁主义为基础的。虽然犯过许多错误，我们党在群众中的影响，比起其他左翼各党来，是大得不可比拟的。在1935年的时候，它的党员人数曾达到八万左右。大约就在这个时候，我们党开始遭到一连串的灾难，这些灾难实质上就是残酷的帝国主义对党进行了不断的打击。这些灾难包括：产联在1949年开除了拥有约一百万会员的十一个左翼工会；党内白劳德修正主义的领导（实际上取消了党），使党损失了约一万五千名党员；政府和许多工会头子等进行疯狂的战争宣传，有害地影响了许多党员；从1948年开始，政府对党进行长期迫害，包括把党的许多领袖逮捕和监禁，迫使党几乎完全转入地下，使党损失了好几千党员；党犯了若干错误，例如在1948年组织进步党，这也使我们损失了好几千党员；对斯大林个人迷信的后果，严重地损害了在美国的社会主义宣传；长期以来美国繁荣的腐蚀作用和由此而来的美国例外论之类的理论，造成了有毒的影响。于是，党在1955年发生了一次严重的修正主义危机，使党几乎遭到毁灭。党又损失了好几千党员。目前的情况是，我们的党员人数虽然已经减少到很低的数字，但是，我们党正在逐渐从它所经历的严重危机中恢复过来。总的来说，修正主义分子已经被击败了。毫无疑问，美帝国主义利用它的许多代理人，一直企图毁灭我们党，但是它失败了。
    以上所述，可以提供您一些关于美国形势的实际情况，同时也表示我自己对于在您领导下的光辉的中国共产党的钦佩。我希望，尽管有种种困难，终有一天能够同您相见，并且同您当面畅叙。我深信您的身体一定非常健康。请向您所有的同志转致我衷心的问候。
                                您的同志
