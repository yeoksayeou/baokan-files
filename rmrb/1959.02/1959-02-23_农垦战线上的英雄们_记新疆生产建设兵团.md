Heroes on the Agricultural Reclamation Front
——A Record of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps
By Our Correspondent Wang Boqing

　　People say the frontier is too desolate, unaware of the treasures here;
　　Labor can turn the world upside down, the frontier will surely become paradise.

This is a poem written nine years ago by a soldier stationed at the foot of the Pamir Plateau.

Just like the heroic spirit displayed in this poem, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army inherited the glorious tradition of hard struggle from the People's Liberation Army and embarked on a path of combat on the agricultural reclamation front, progressing from nothing to something, and from small to large. In the early days of entering the wilderness, the soldiers ate whole wheat grains, had no vegetables and used salt water as vegetables, and without production tools, they used manpower to pull plows for sowing. Thus, they finally overcame a series of difficulties, and by the autumn of 1958, they had established more than forty mechanized state-owned farms.

A few years ago, this place was full of reed marshes and bushes, making it difficult for people to pass even on horseback; but now, teams of tractors are speeding here, plowing hundreds and thousands of acres of black land into a continuous stretch. In the past, where foxes and wild boars ran rampant, soldiers are now grazing herds of "Xinjiang sheep" and raising "Ukrainian" white pigs and various poultry. Some places used to be so arid that not a drop of water existed. Local Uyghur farmers had to lay wooden boards on the Gobi Desert as canals to divert water across the desert. Now, soldiers have built many large-scale canals and reservoirs in those places, bringing in rolling snow water to irrigate the arid land. Every harvest season, wheat waves roll over millions of acres of land, and the grapes, peaches, and apples planted in the fields a few years ago are now laden with fruit.

In 1958, a year of miracles, the Production Corps and the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang jointly wrote a brilliant page in agricultural reclamation production. In that year, the planting area reached more than three million mu, and grain output doubled compared to 1957, equivalent to four times the total increase in production by the Production Corps during the First Five-Year Plan; cotton output also increased by 20% compared to 1957. Just as a soldier's poem says: "Our drive is great, ten thousand arrows are fired together, we will break through the sky every day, and collapse the earth when we touch it." The soldiers, with full drive, combined hard work, practical work, and clever work, and created many outstanding achievements in 1958. The famous "Fire Continent" Turpan Basin is an ideal cotton-producing area in our country. The weather there is notoriously hot, with daytime temperatures reaching over 40 degrees Celsius in the summer. Soldiers Xu Haijia and Xue Mingzhe, in order to manage the cotton well, often braved the scorching heat, eating and sleeping in the fields. As a result, their twelve mu of high-yielding cotton fields averaged 1,499 jin of seed cotton per mu, with 1.17 mu averaging 3,677 jin of seed cotton per mu. This raised the cotton field yield record here to an unprecedented peak.

What kind of people created such outstanding achievements? Let's first look at the story of tractor driver Tang Zhengtao! Tang Zhengtao is a brave and forward-looking female member of the Communist Youth League. In the six months from February to August 1958, she drove a "Nate-25" tractor and, together with her assistant, completed a task that would have taken two years and seven months. Last summer, a production team's cotton fields suffered from drought and urgently needed watering after the tractor had dug the ditches, otherwise, the cotton production would be reduced. Tang Zhengtao accepted the task of digging ditches. On the day she worked, the sun was scorching, and the steering wheel and gear lever of the "Nate-25" tractor, without any shade, were burning hot. But she kept operating, even forgetting to drink water. During the tense work, the water in the tractor's water tank ran out, and the engine was burning like a stove. If she went to the station to fetch water, the work would have to stop for several hours. In order to save the cotton seedlings, even though she herself was dizzy with thirst, she still poured her drinking water into the water tank and continued to work.

In 1958, the Production Corps reclaimed more than 3.7 million mu of wasteland. This means that on average, in the past year, every 24 hours, more than 10,000 mu of wasteland north and south of the Tianshan Mountains were turned into fertile fields. At the Mosowan Second Farm in the Shihezi Reclamation Area on the Manas River, the soldiers completed the construction of a farm planned to be built in one year within half a year. They reclaimed more than 68,000 mu of wasteland last year, 70% of which was put into production, achieving the goal of "reclaiming wasteland in the same year, putting it into production in the same year, and making profits in the same year," setting up a red flag in the high-speed construction of farms.

This is a red flag that demonstrates a heroic spirit of fearlessness. Just as the Siberian cold current hit, the temperature dropped to minus 40 degrees Celsius, and the soldiers, carrying tools, braved the cold wind and entered the wilderness. The wilderness was windy and snowy. The soldiers were already accustomed to this kind of life. They shoveled away the accumulated snow, bravely swung their hoes and shovels, and declared war on the several-foot-thick frozen soil. In order to put the land into production in the same year, they used snowmelt water for irrigation in the spring. In this way, after a few months, they awakened the Mosowan wilderness that had been sleeping for thousands of years.

The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps has already won a great victory on the labor front. Now, under the shining light of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, they are continuing to advance bravely on the road to victory. In order to turn Xinjiang into a cotton and grain base for the motherland together with the people of all ethnic groups, they will launch larger battles in the wilderness of the Tarim River and other places, and transform two to three million mu of wasteland into fertile fields in the next few years. They will plant the red flag of developing the rich resources of the frontier all over the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains.

    农垦战线上的英雄们
    ——记新疆生产建设兵团
    本报记者　汪波清
    人说边疆太荒凉，不知这里有宝藏；
    劳动能够翻天地，边疆定会变天堂。
    这是九年以前进驻在帕米尔高原下的一位战士写下的一首诗。
    正像这首诗显示的豪迈气概那样，中国人民解放军新疆生产建设部队继承了人民解放军艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，在农垦战线上走过了一个从无到有，从小到大的战斗路程。在最初进入荒原的那些日子里，战士们吃的是囫囵麦粒，没有菜，就拿盐水当菜，没有生产工具就用人拉犁播种。这样，他们终于克服了一系列困难，到1958年秋季已经建立了四十多个机械化的国营农场。
    几年以前，这里还处处是芦苇林、灌木丛，人们骑着马也难得闯过去；可是，现在成队成队的拖拉机在这里驰骋，耕翻着几百亩几千亩连成一片的黑色土地。在过去狐狼、野猪行凶的地方，战士们放牧着成群的“新疆羊”，养起了“乌克兰”白猪和各种家禽。有的地方过去干旱得滴水没有，当地维吾尔族农民为了把水引过戈壁滩，曾不得不用木板铺在戈壁滩上当作水渠，现在战士们已经在那些地方修建了许多大型渠道和水库，引来滚滚的雪水，滋润着干旱的土地。每年收获季节，千百万亩土地上麦浪翻滚，田园里几年前栽的葡萄、桃、苹果，已是果实累累。
    在1958年这个出奇迹的一年里，生产部队和新疆各族人民一道，在农垦生产上写下了灿烂的一页。这一年种植面积达到三百多万亩，粮食产量比1957年增加了一倍，相当于生产部队在第一个五年计划期间增产总数的四倍；棉花产量也比1957年增加了20％。正像一位战士的诗说的：“我们干劲大，万箭一齐发，战天天要破，碰地地要塌”。战士们鼓足干劲，把苦干、实干和巧干结合起来，在1958年创造了许多出色的成绩。著名的“火洲”吐鲁番盆地是我国一块理想的产棉区。那里的天气是有名的热，夏天白昼温度可以达到摄氏四十度以上，战士徐海甲和薛明哲，为了管理好棉花，常冒着酷热，吃在田间，睡在田间。结果他们管理的十二亩丰产棉田平均亩产籽棉一千四百九十九斤，其中有一点一七亩平均亩产籽棉达到三千六百七十七斤。把这里的棉田亩产纪录提高到史无前例的高峰。
    创造了优异成绩的都是怎样一些人呢？先看一看拖拉机手汤征桃的事迹吧！汤征桃是一个勇往直前的女共青团员，在1958年2月到8月的六个月中，她驾驶一台“热特—25”拖拉机，和她的助手一起，就完成了两年又七个月的任务。去年夏天，一个生产队的棉田受了旱，急需在拖拉机开沟后浇水，否则棉花就要减产。汤征桃接受了开沟的任务，在她工作的这天，烈日当空，没有遮阳的“热特—25”拖拉机，方向盘和变速杆晒得烫手，但是她还是不停地操作，甚至连口水都顾不得喝。正在紧张劳动的时候，拖拉机水箱里的水用光了，车头烧得像火炉一般，如果到驻地去取水，工作就要停好几个钟头。为了救棉苗，虽然她自己干渴得头发晕，但是她仍然把自己喝的水倒进水箱，又继续工作起来。
    1958年，生产部队开垦了荒地三百七十多万亩。这就是说，平均在去年每二十四小时内，天山南北就有一万来亩荒地变成了良田。玛纳斯河畔石河子垦区，莫索湾第二农场的战士们在去年半年内，建成了计划要一年建成的农场，他们在去年开荒六万八千多亩，其中70％的土地投入生产，实现了“当年开荒，当年投入生产，当年生产有利”的目标，在高速度建设农场方面树起了一面红旗。
    这是一面表现了英勇的大无畏精神的红旗，正当西伯利亚寒流袭来的时候，气温下降到零下四十度，战士们扛着工具，迎着冷风开进了荒原。荒原上风大雪深。战士们早已习惯了这种生活，他们铲开积雪，奋勇地挥起镢头铁锹，向几尺厚的冰冻土块开战了。为了做到当年投入生产，他们在春季利用融雪水浇地。就这样在几个月后，他们唤醒了沉睡千百年的莫索湾荒野。
    新疆生产建设部队在劳动战线上已经打了一个大胜仗。现在，在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，他们正在胜利的道路上继续奋勇前进。他们为了和各族人民把新疆变成祖国的一块棉花和粮食基地，要在塔里木河等地的荒原上发起更大的战役，要使两三千万亩荒地在最近几年内变成良田。他们要把开发边疆富源的红旗插遍天山南北。
