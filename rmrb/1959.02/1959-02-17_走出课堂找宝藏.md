Stepping Out of the Classroom to Find Treasures
A Record of the Beijing Mining Institute Coalfield Geology Department's Work-Study Exhibition by Peng Yinglu

In response to the Party's call, teachers and students of the Coalfield Geology Department of the Beijing Mining Institute engaged in work-study and labor production activities in the field for eight months, starting in May of last year. Over four hundred teachers and students traveled across a large part of China. They found a total of 3.3 billion tons of coal (with a predicted reserve of 12 billion to 24 billion tons), 600 million tons of iron, and 44 kinds of rare metals and radioactive elements. They wrote over 800 geological reports, scientific research papers, and work summaries; and they proposed supplementary and revised opinions on some past geological theories and conclusions. Now, they are reporting these fruitful results to the Party and the country through an exhibition. The following are just a few fragments of the exhibition, but they show that through this work-study and labor production activity in the field, the teachers and students not only created wealth for the country but also educated the youth, and they deeply fell in love with the geological cause of the motherland.

	Who Says There's No Coal in the South?

In the past, some geologists asserted that there were no abundant coal deposits in southern China. However, in the exhibition hall, a photo of a coconut grove with more than twenty young men in it gives a powerful rebuttal to this fallacy. This group of young men found rich mineral deposits on Hainan Island.

Hainan Island—the treasure island of the motherland. It has beautiful scenery and is rich in tropical and subtropical cash crops such as rubber, coconuts, pineapples, and coffee. The coastal area has extremely rich mineral deposits. These young people, who had never left the north, came to Hainan Island, not to enjoy the beautiful southern scenery, nor to taste the exotic fruits of the south, but they said, "We want to go to those mountains, primeval forests, and endless beaches to find all kinds of treasures."

Gales, torrential rains, and outdoor camping life were nothing to these young people, but leeches and poisonous snakes were the "enemies" that threatened them. Every time they walked a certain distance, they would find several leeches on their legs and waists. The young people were not frightened by these. The geological hammer they carried became a "weapon" for self-defense, and the local Miao compatriots were their best guides. After more than three months of hard work, this group of young people finally found more than 100 million tons of coal, more than 300 million tons of iron, and a variety of minerals on Hainan Island, completing geological maps of 68.31 million square kilometers and successfully completing the general survey task.

	An Unusual Little Fossil

Walking into the specimen display hall, one is presented with all kinds of mineral specimens and strange animal and plant fossils. These specimens and fossils are a small part of what the students collected during the labor process. Among them are rare gold and uranium ores, and precious trilobite and black coral fossils. What interests the audience most is an inconspicuous "graptolite" from Guangdong. This small fossil has an unusual story. Not long ago, someone predicted that there were more than 2.8 billion tons of coal reserves in the Taishan area of Guangdong, and a large number of people and drilling rigs were transferred to prepare for a comprehensive drilling, and plans were made to establish modern shafts. Students from the Guangdong team found this small fossil—"graptolite"—in this area. They analyzed that graptolites are standardized fossils belonging to the Ordovician strata, while coal can only be formed above the Ordovician strata. Since the Ordovician strata have already appeared, it proves that the coal above has weathered away, and even if there is coal, the reserves are extremely small. Later, after appraisal by relevant departments, it was considered that the students' inference was correct. This small "graptolite" saved the country a considerable amount of money.

	Friendship Between College Students and Farmers

In the exhibition hall, there is a very meaningful coordinate map, which embodies the friendship between college students and farmers.

The incident happened in the Benxi Niuxintai People's Commune prospecting team of the Northeast team. The main task of the team was to cooperate with the local small blast furnace production to find iron ore. They had been in the commune for several days, and no iron ore had been found. The team members were very anxious. What to do? The team held a free discussion meeting. Through the discussion, everyone clarified that to find a mine, it is necessary to rely on the local Party organization and the local villagers. So they asked the Party organization of the local People's Commune to treat them as members of the commune, and to eat, live, and work with the villagers. Whenever they had free time, they would tell the villagers about recognizing mines, finding mines, and some basic geological knowledge. The villagers gradually fell in love with this group of college students, and a wave of mass reporting of mines was set off. Some villagers told the students about the ore outcrops they had discovered long ago. Based on the clues provided by the villagers, they found a large amount of magnetite. At the same time, they also received a vivid education on geology run by the whole Party and the whole people.

A long time has passed since this incident, but the students have always had a "stone" in their hearts that they haven't put down, that is, how to repay the enthusiastic help of the villagers?

The students of the Northeast team returned to school and devoted themselves to the research of indigenous methods of finding mines. They selected more than 60 ore samples from the ore samples of 100 mining points they had surveyed locally and carefully tested and analyzed them, found the relationship between the grade and specific gravity of iron ore, and the curve of magnetite analysis and chemical analysis, and made this unprecedented "simple and rapid analysis method of iron ore" coordinate map. After many validations, even a farmer with a low level of education can use a scale and a bucket of water to find out the grade and reserves of iron ore based on this coordinate map. The students of the Northeast team are preparing to send this "coordinate map" to the Niuxintai People's Commune.

	Combination of Teachers and Students, Mutual Growth in Teaching

The various technical innovations and inventions displayed in the technical innovation hall and the deeds show that the achievement of these achievements is the result of the implementation of the Party's education policy, and also the result of the combination of teachers and students.

When the students were designing the "unmanned automatic lifting device on the tower," they regarded "automatic" as very mysterious, and the design scheme was very complicated and not suitable for the characteristics of field work. Ma Zhikan, a lecturer in the prospecting teaching and research group, learned about this situation. He not only introduced the experience of the "inclined lifting device" in the Northeast, but also helped the students get rid of the complicated design. After joint research by teachers and students, they finally successfully trial-produced the "unmanned automatic lifting device on the tower," which saved two people's labor compared with the original one. Teachers and students also studied, discussed, and applied together, and worked together to complete the ground electrical survey report of Jiulishan, providing information on the underground mineral deposits of Jiulishan.

The students of the Coalfield Geology Department of the Mining Institute have now started a new academic year. Many new contents have been added to the "Chinese Geology" course. These new contents are precisely the data collected by the students from the field, which have been sorted, processed, and incorporated under the guidance of teachers.

    走出课堂找宝藏
    记北京矿业学院煤田地质系勤工俭学展览会  彭应禄
    北京矿业学院煤田地质系师生，响应党的号召，从去年5月起到野外进行了八个月的勤工俭学、劳动生产活动。四百多师生跑遍了大半个中国。共找到煤三十三亿吨（预测储量一百二十到二百四十亿吨），铁六亿吨，各种稀有金属、放射性元素等四十四种；写出八百多篇地质报告、科学研究论文和工作总结；并对过去一些地质理论和结论提出了补充和修改意见。现在，他们正把这些丰硕的果实，通过展览会向党、向祖国汇报。下面记述的仅是展览会的几个片断，但是可以看出师生们通过这次野外勤工俭学、劳动生产活动，不但为国家创造了财富，而且使青年们受到了教育，他们深深地爱上了祖国的地质事业。
        谁说南方无煤田
    过去，有些地质学家曾断言我国南方没有丰富的煤藏。但是，在展览馆里，一张有着椰子林的照片上的二十多个小伙子，却给这种谬论一个有力的回击，这群青年在海南岛上找到了丰富的矿藏。
    海南岛——祖国的宝岛，这里风景优美、盛产橡胶、椰子、菠罗、咖啡等热带与亚热带的经济作物，沿海一带有着极丰富的矿藏。这些从来没有离开过北方的青年人到海南岛，不是为了欣赏明媚的南国风光，也不是为了品尝南方的奇异瓜果，他们说：“我们要去那丛山峻岭、原始森林，以及那一望无际的沙滩，找寻各种宝藏。”
    狂风暴雨，野外露宿生活，对这群青年人早已算不得什么，但山蚂蝗和毒蛇却是威胁他们的“敌人”，每当走过一段路，他们在腿上、腰上总要发现几条山蚂蝗。青年人没有被这些吓住。他们随身携带的地质锤，成了自卫的“武器”，当地的苗族同胞是他们最好的响导。经过三个多月的苦战，这群青年人终于在海南岛上，找到了一亿多吨煤，三亿多吨铁，还有多种多样的矿藏，完成地质图六千八百三十一万平方公里，出色地完成了普查任务。
  一块不平常的小化石
    走进标本陈列馆，出现在眼前的是各种各样的矿物标本和奇奇怪怪的动、植物化石。这些标本和化石，是学生们在劳动过程中搜集的一小部分。其中有稀有的金、铀矿石，有珍贵的三叶虫、黑珊瑚化石等等。使观众最感兴趣的是一块不引人注目的、来自广东的“笔石”。这块小化石，有一段不平常的故事。不久前，有人预测广东台山一带储藏煤二十八亿吨以上，并且调来了大批的人力和钻机，准备进行全面钻探，还计划建立现代化的竖井。广东队的学生在这地方找到这块小小的化石——“笔石”。他们分析，笔石是属于奥陶纪地层的标准化石，而煤的形成只能在奥陶纪地层的上面，既然奥陶纪地层已出现了，证明上面的煤已经风化掉了，即使有煤储量也极少。后来经过有关部门的鉴定，认为学生们的推论是正确的。这块小小的“笔石”使国家避免了一笔数目不小的损失。
      大学生和农民的友谊
    在展览馆里，有一张很有意义的座标图，它凝结着大学生和农民的友谊。
    事情发生在东北队本溪牛心台人民公社普查小队里。小队的主要任务是配合当地小高炉生产找铁矿。他们来到公社已经好几天了，一个铁矿还没发现，小队成员都非常着急。怎么办？小队里召开了务虚会，通过务虚大家都明确要找到矿一定要依靠当地党组织，依靠当地老乡。于是他们要求当地人民公社的党组织把他们当做公社社员，并且和老乡同吃、同住、同劳动。一有空闲他们就给老乡讲认矿、找矿和一些地质基本知识。老乡们渐渐爱上了这群大学生，一个群众报矿热潮就随之掀起来了。有的老乡将自己早就发现了的矿苗告诉了学生们，根据老乡提供的线索，他们找到了大量磁铁矿。同时也受到了一次生动的全党、全民办地质的教育。
    这件事过去了很久，学生们心里有块
    “石头”一直没放下，就是怎样报答老乡们的热情帮助？
    东北队的学生们回到学校，就投入土法找矿的研究，他们从当地调查过的一百个矿点的矿石样品中，选出六十多个矿石进行了仔细的化验与分析，找到了铁矿品位与比重的关系，磁铁分析与化学分析的曲线，制成了这张从未有过的“铁矿简易、快速分析法”的座标图。经过多次验正，即使一个文化很低的农民，用一杆秤和一桶水，依据这张座标图，就可找出铁矿的品位与储量。东北队的学生们正准备把这张“座标图”，寄给牛心台人民公社。
    师生结合，教学相长
    在技术革新馆展出的各种技术革新和发明创造的实物和事迹，表明这些成绩的获得是贯彻党的教育方针的结果，也是师生相结合的结果。
    学生们在设计“塔上无人自动提引器”时，把“自动”看得非常神秘，设计出的方案很复杂，不适合野外工作的特点。勘探教研组的讲师马植侃了解到这个情况后，不但介绍了东北“斜面提引器”的经验，而且还帮助学生们摆脱复杂的设计，经过师生共同研究，终于试制成功了比原来节省两个人力的“塔上无人自动提引器”。教师和学生还边学、边讨论、边应用，共同努力，完成了九里山地面电测报告，提供了九里山地下矿藏的情况。
    矿业学院煤田地质系的学生们现在又开始了新的学年，在“中国地质”这门课程中增添了许多新的内容，这些新的内容正是学生们从野外收集回来的资料，在老师指导下整理、加工后编入的。
