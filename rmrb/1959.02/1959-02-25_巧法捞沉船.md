   Clever Method for Salvaging Sunken Ships
   Liang Hengxin
    Salvaging sunken ships and repairing them costs half as much as building a new ship and is much faster. From liberation to the end of 1957, we had salvaged 176 sunken ships, totaling 145,000 tons. The large ocean liner "Peace 16" was also salvaged from the seabed and restored to its youth after repairs. Last year's Great Leap Forward saw more than 70,000 tons of sunken ships resurface.
    The ability to salvage sunken ships is the result of our utilization of water's buoyancy.
    A piece of wood can float on the water surface because of the buoyancy of the water. Adding a person on top won't work. This isn't because there's no buoyancy, but because the buoyancy is too small to support the combined weight of the wood and the person.
    What methods can increase buoyancy?
    After a ship sinks, the hull is punctured, and water seeps in, causing buoyancy to fail. How can we regain buoyancy and salvage it?
    The problem lies in the hull's leaks. In the past, the method for salvaging sunken ships was to send divers to the seabed to repair the leaks, pump air into the ship to force the water out, and enable the ship to regain buoyancy and rise back to the surface. Although this method was good, working underwater was very difficult; at a depth of forty meters, the pressure is about five atmospheres, and a diver's work should not exceed one hour at a time.
    Can we not gain buoyancy without sealing the leaks? This question provided great inspiration. Look at people learning to swim, they don't need to seal their entire body to gain buoyancy! As long as they wear a lifebuoy, this sealed air-filled bladder pushes a lot of water away when it enters the water, gaining buoyancy and even floating the person.
    It would be great to put lifebuoys on ships. This is not a fantasy or a joke. The "pontoon salvage method" we are currently using cleverly utilizes the principle of lifebuoys.
    A pontoon is a very large hollow iron cylinder, divided into three compartments, with a buoyancy compartment in the middle larger compartment. Each of the three compartments has a seabed valve, an exhaust valve, and an air inlet. To submerge it, open the seabed valve and exhaust valve to fill each compartment with water, then the pontoon sinks. Then tie it to both sides of the sunken ship. When you want the pontoon to re-float, close the exhaust valve and pump air into the air inlet to drain the water. After the pontoon regains buoyancy, it rises and lifts the sunken ship as well.

   巧法捞沉船
   梁恒心
    把沉船捞起来加以修复，其费用比造一艘新船节省一半而且时间快得多。从解放以后到1957年底，我们已捞起沉船一百七十六艘，共十四万五千吨。大海轮和平16号也是从海底捞起，修理后回复青春的。去年大跃进，又有七万多吨沉船重见天日。
    沉船能够捞起来，这是我们利用水的浮力的结果。
    一根木料可以浮在水面，这是水的浮力的作用。上面再站一个人就不行了，这不是没有浮力，而是浮力太小不能支持木头和人合起来的重量。
    有什么方法能增加浮力呢？
    船失事后船壳穿了，水渗进来浮力失效了。怎样从新获得浮力而把它捞起来呢？
    毛病就在船壳的漏洞。过去打捞沉船的办法是派人潜入海底，修补漏洞，灌气入船将渗入的水赶出来，使船重新获得了浮力而升回水面。这个办法虽然好，但潜入水中作活是十分艰巨的；在水深四十公尺的地方压力约有五个大气压，潜水员的工作一次不能超过一小时。
    难道不封漏洞就不能获得浮力么？经这一问，给人们极大的启发，你看学游泳的人，何尝要把整个人封闭着才能获得浮力呢！只要带上救生圈，这个封闭而灌满空气的气囊，入水后挤开很多水，获得了浮力，连人也浮起来了。
    能够给轮船带上救生圈就好了，这不是空想和笑话，我们现在采用的“浮筒打捞法”，就是巧妙地利用了救生圈的原理。
    浮筒是一个很大的空心铁筒，里面分三个仓，中间一个较大的仓里面还有一个浮力仓。三个仓各有一个海底阀、出气阀和进气口。要它沉下时打开海底阀和出气阀，使各个仓充满水后，浮筒就下沉。然后将它缚在沉船的两旁。要让浮筒重新浮起的时候，就把出气阀关闭，再从进气口内打气排水。浮筒重新获得浮力后就上升，并且把沉船也抬浮起来。
