Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th. The production competition initiated by Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant, and Yangquan Iron and Steel Plant in Shanxi Province has developed into a "three-high" red flag competition focused on iron, characterized by high output, high quality, and high efficiency, sweeping the entire iron and steel industry front in the province. The production levels of pig iron and steel in the province are rising daily with the vigorous development of this movement. Currently, the daily output of pig iron in the province has increased by 66% compared to the average daily output in January, and the daily output of steel has increased by more than 200 tons compared to the average daily output in January. In the first half of February, the daily output of pig iron at Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company exceeded that of January by 7.1%, and on the 19th and 20th, it even increased by 40% compared to the average daily output in January. On the 25th, the company's ironmaking plant completed the state's pig iron production plan for February ahead of schedule and exceeded its quota.

Currently, more than 20 large and medium-sized iron and steel plants in the province have joined this competition. Even other factories related to steel production, such as Taiyuan Refractory Materials Factory, Yangquan Refractory Materials Factory, and Yangquan Alumina Factory, have actively participated.

The "three-high" competitions in various regions, comparing high output, high quality, and high efficiency, generally require reaching the following levels: in increasing pig iron output by improving blast furnace utilization coefficient, the average monthly utilization coefficients of large, small, and indigenous blast furnaces should reach 1.5, 1.1, and 0.7, respectively; in terms of quality, good iron and good steel are required, while the ash content of coke should be reduced from the current 20% to below 13%, the sulfur content should not exceed 1%, the iron content of ore should reach over 40%, and the refractoriness of blast furnace refractory bricks should reach over 1700 degrees Celsius. Mining and transportation efficiency must also be greatly improved to meet production needs. The iron ore used by Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company this year has a lower iron content than last year. In response to this situation, the entire plant has strengthened ore dressing, sintering, and increased smelting intensity, overcoming difficulties and raising the blast furnace utilization coefficient of the entire plant to 1.82 tons in recent days, with the Youth Furnace reaching 2.08 tons. Yingchao Iron and Steel Plant in Yangcheng County and Jinci Iron Plant in Taiyuan City have also adopted measures such as strengthening ore dressing and improving technology to increase the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces and increase pig iron production.

While various iron and steel plants in the province are catching up with each other and promoting mutual progress, they are all centered on the three iron and steel companies and plants in Taiyuan, Changzhi, and Yangquan, first ensuring the production leap forward of key iron and steel plants. In order to ensure the production leap forward of Yangquan Iron and Steel Plant, five counties and cities in Jinzhong District, including Jiexiu, Heshun, and Yuci, held a coordination meeting to expand production to support Yangquan's ore and coke supply, and organized more than 60 trucks and 400 horse-drawn carts to transport coke and ore to Yangquan continuously. Counties near Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant in the Jin Southeast region also actively supported key areas in terms of raw material transportation. More than a dozen machine factories, including Shanxi Machine Tool Factory, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory, and Shanxi Machinery Factory, actively undertook the task of rushing to manufacture metallurgical equipment for the new construction project of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, carrying out collaboration to meet the needs of the project.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 27th. The broad masses of workers on the iron and steel front in Shandong Province have launched a "six-comparison" red flag competition movement centered on technological revolution - comparing output, quality, cost, safety, efficiency, and ideology. After this period of competition, the province's iron and steel production has achieved significant results. Comparing the average daily output for the seven days from February 16th to 22nd with the average daily output for the first one and a half months of this year, the province's iron increased by 17.3%, and steel increased by more than double. Quality has also improved significantly. For example, the sulfur content of pig iron at Jinan Shengjian Iron and Steel Plant has been reduced to 0.049%, and the finished product rate has reached 97%. Workers in the steelmaking workshop of Qingdao State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 6 have tried every means to break through technical barriers, achieving furnace after furnace of molten iron turning into steel, ladle after ladle of molten steel being poured into ingots, and every steel ingot meeting quality standards. Driven by the competition movement, workers on the iron and steel front in Weifang City have vigorously engaged in technological revolution, increasing the city's average daily pig iron output from more than 210 tons to more than 270 tons, reducing the sulfur content of pig iron to 0.15%, and significantly reducing costs.

This "six-comparison" red flag competition movement particularly emphasizes reducing the sulfur content of iron and steel and improving the quality of iron and steel. In this regard, it is required to pass five levels: (1) Coal for coking must be washed and selected to ensure that the sulfur content, ash content, and moisture content of washed coal do not exceed the specified standards; (2) Rapidly improve the technical level of coking to reduce the sulfur content and ash content in coke; (3) Ore must be selected, and high-sulfur ore must be roasted to improve grade and reduce sulfur content; (4) Strictly implement desulfurization inside and outside the furnace during ironmaking; (5) Strictly control the sulfur content of iron used for steelmaking. In terms of output, it is required that all built blast furnaces strive to be fully put into production, and new and expanded ones should be completed as soon as possible and put into production ahead of schedule. Costs should be reduced to the lowest possible level. In order to achieve the above requirements, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China first requires party committees at all levels to strengthen their leadership over iron and steel production; various cities, special districts, and key factories and mines must immediately establish and improve organizational structures, strictly conduct technical inspection and supervision work and chemical testing work, and establish corresponding systems, with each level being responsible, and any unqualified products, especially products for external transfer, shall not leave the factory.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 27th. More than 40,000 iron and steel workers in Tianjin held a competition and skill demonstration radio conference this afternoon, deciding to launch a socialist competition movement across the city's iron and steel industry front, comparing output, quality, variety, conservation, collaboration, and safety.

Representatives of the Emerging Steel Plant, which was rated as a municipal model unit in 1958, challenged Tianjin Steel Plant at the conference, setting the conditions of completing the annual steel production task one month ahead of schedule and achieving a steel ingot prime product rate of 98%, and put forward specific measures such as balancing equipment capacity, improving converter furnace life, improving operations, and comprehensively formulating operating procedures for steelmaking with indigenous iron. Representatives of Tianjin Steel Plant immediately accepted the challenge at the meeting. They guaranteed to vigorously engage in technological revolution to increase labor productivity by 96% compared to last year, increase the plant's steel output by two times compared to last year, and achieve a steel ingot prime product rate of 98%. Their slogan is: "No matter how difficult, we will never lack a penny!"

In order to ensure the completion of the annual steel production task, steel rolling workers throughout the city had already sounded the war drums before the conference. They vigorously launched a technological revolution movement centered on improving production efficiency; now, many small rolling mills in the steel rolling plant have realized coiling, the primary rolling mill has realized mechanization, and production efficiency has been greatly improved as a result. At today's conference, representatives of Tianjin Steel Rolling Plant No. 1 challenged steel rolling plant workers throughout the city, setting the conditions of guaranteeing an annual output of 210,000 tons of steel, a shaped steel prime product rate of 99.7%, and a wire prime product rate of 99.5%. Representatives of various steel rolling plants also expressed their acceptance of the challenge with advanced indicators and measures. Subsequently, representatives of Tianjin Refractory Materials Factory, Welding Rod Factory, Ironmaking Factory, and other units also successively put forward the conditions of challenge and acceptance at the meeting.

    高产高质高效率竞赛浪潮席卷山西山东
    钢铁日产水平步步高升
    天津钢铁战士誓师比产量比质量比品种比节约比协作比安全
    据新华社太原27日电　山西省由太原钢铁公司、长治钢铁厂、阳泉钢铁厂首先挑起的生产竞赛，已发展成为一个以铁为中心的高产量、高质量、高效率的席卷全省钢铁工业战线的“三高”红旗竞赛。全省生铁和钢的生产水平正随着这个运动的蓬勃开展而逐日上升。现在全省生铁的日产量已比1月份的平均日产量提高66％，钢的日产量也比1月份平均日产量增加了二百多吨。太原钢铁公司2月上半月的生铁日产量超过1月份7.1％，19、20两日更比1月份平均日产量提高40％。25日，这个公司的炼铁厂就提前超额完成2月份国家生铁生产计划。
    现在，全省卷入这场竞赛的已有二十多个大中型钢铁厂。甚至其他和钢铁生产有关的工厂，如太原耐火材料厂、阳泉耐火材料厂、阳泉氧化铝厂等也纷纷参战。
    各地比高产量、比高质量、比高效率的“三高”竞赛，一般要求达到这样的水平；在提高高炉利用系数增加生铁产量上，大洋炉、小洋炉、土高炉每月平均利用系数分别达到一点五、一点一、零点七；质量方面作到铁要好铁、钢要好钢，同时使焦炭的灰份由现在的20％降到13％以下，含硫量不超过1％，矿石含铁量达到40％以上，高炉耐火砖的耐火度要达到一千七百度以上，并且要大大提高采矿和运输效率，以适应生产的需要。太原钢铁公司今年使用的矿石含铁量比去年降低，针对这种情况，全厂加强了选矿、烧结和提高冶炼强度等措施，克服困难，使这几天全厂高炉利用系数提高到一点八二吨，其中青年号高炉利用系数达到二点零八吨。阳城县应朝钢铁厂、太原市晋祠铁厂也都采取加强选矿和改进技术等措施，提高高炉利用系数，增加生铁产量。
    全省各钢铁厂在你追我赶互相促进的同时，并都以太原、长治、阳泉三个钢铁公司、钢铁厂为中心，首先保证重点钢铁厂的生产跃进。晋中地区介休、和顺、榆次等五个县市，为了保证阳泉钢铁厂生产跃进，特召开协作会议，扩大生产支援阳泉的矿石和焦炭，并组织六十多辆汽车和四百多辆马车，把焦炭和矿石源源地运到阳泉。晋东南地区靠近长治钢铁厂的各县，也从原料运输等方面积极支援重点。山西机床厂、太原矿山机器厂、太原重型机器厂和山西机器厂等十多个机器厂，都积极担负起为太原钢铁公司新建工程赶制冶金设备的任务，开展协作，以赶上工程需要。
    据新华社济南27日电　山东省钢铁战线上的广大职工掀起了以技术革命为中心的“六比”红旗竞赛运动——比产量，比质量，比成本，比安全，比效率，比思想。经过这一段时期的竞赛运动，全省钢铁生产获得了显著成绩。以2月16日至22日七天的平均日产量与今年头一个半月的平均日产量相比，全省铁增长了17.3％，钢增加了一倍以上。质量也有较大提高。如济南生建钢铁厂的生铁含硫量已经降低到0.049％，成品率达到了97％。青岛国棉六厂炼钢车间职工千方百计突破技术关，达到炉炉铁水变成钢，包包钢水浇成锭，根根钢锭质量合格。潍坊市钢铁战线职工在竞赛运动推动下，大闹技术革命，使全市的生铁平均日产量由二百一十多吨提高到二百七十多吨，生铁含硫量降低到0.15％，成本也有显著降低。
    这次“六比”红旗竞赛运动，特别强调要降低钢铁的含硫量，提高钢铁的质量。在这方面，要求过好五关：（1）炼焦用煤必须进行洗选，保证洗煤的含硫量、灰分、水分不超过规定标准；（2）迅速提高炼焦的技术水平，降低焦中的含硫量和灰分；（3）矿石必须进行拣选，含硫高的矿石必须经过焙烧，以提高品位，减少含硫量；
  （4）炼铁时要严格执行炉内炉外脱硫；（5）严格控制炼钢用铁的含硫量。在产量方面，要求已建好的高炉力争全面投入生产，新建和扩建的要早日建成，提前投入生产。成本要降低到最低水平。为了达到以上要求，中共山东省委首先要求各级党委加强对钢铁生产的领导；各市、专区和重点厂矿要立即建立和健全组织机构，严格进行技术检查监督工作和化验工作，并建立相应的制度，层层负责，凡不合规格要求的产品特别是外调的产品，一概不出厂。
    新华社天津27日电　天津市四万多名钢铁职工今天下午举行了竞赛比武广播大会，决定从现在开始在全市钢铁工业战线上掀起一个比产量、比质量、比品种、比节约、比协作、比安全的社会主义竞赛运动。
    被评为1958年市级模范单位的新兴钢厂职工代表，在大会上以提前一个月完成全年钢产任务、钢锭正品率达到98％为条件，向天津钢厂提出挑战，并且提出了平衡设备能力、提高转炉炉龄、改进操作、全面制定土铁炼钢操作规程等具体措施。天津钢厂的职工代表立即在会上应战。他们保证大搞技术革命，使劳动生产率比去年提高96％，全厂的钢产量比去年增加两倍，钢锭的正品率达到98％。他们的口号是：“不管如何困难，决不缺少一钱！”
    全市轧钢工人为保证完成全年的钢产任务，早在大会之前就擂起战鼓。他们蓬蓬勃勃地开展了以提高生产效率为中心的技术革命运动；现在，轧钢厂的许多小型轧钢机已经实现了围盘化，初轧机实现了机械化，生产效率因而大为提高。在今天的大会上，天津轧钢一厂的职工代表以保证年产二十一万吨钢材、型钢正品率达到99.7％、线材正品率达到99.5％为条件，向全市轧钢厂职工挑战。各轧钢厂的职工代表也以先进的指标和措施表示应战。接着天津耐火器材厂、电焊条厂、炼铁厂等单位的代表，都纷纷在会上提出了挑战和应战的条件。（附图片）
    太原钢铁公司职工大闹技术革新。焦化厂的炼焦工人在自己创造的土洋结合的炼焦炉上，又配制了一台土推焦机。它投入生产以后，就可使推焦工序由手工操作改成机械化，焦炭产量可由过去的日产十几炉增到日产二十多炉。　新华社记者　周树铭摄
