Drop by Drop into a Stream
——Introducing a Set of Indigenous Coking and Oil Recovery Experiences
Li Puqing

Indigenous coking can recover coal tar while producing coke. This coal tar is a very valuable light oil. This year, the output of indigenous coking in various regions is considerable, allowing for the recovery of a significant amount of coal tar. Currently, more and more indigenous coking plants are freeing up resources to focus on comprehensive utilization (mainly oil recovery) in order to reduce coke costs and increase output value. Here are some existing oil recovery experiences for reference.

At present, the two types of indigenous coking furnaces widely used in China are the Pingxiang-style long furnace and the Zhongxing-style round furnace. Both of these furnaces are suitable for recovering coal tar. The production process for recovering coal tar is the same for both: first, "extract," which means extracting the coal gas containing coal tar from the coal seam inside the furnace; second, "recover," which means separating the coal tar from the coal gas through condensation equipment. The method of using chimney suction to extract coal gas is called natural draft oil recovery; the method of using a fan to extract coal gas is called mechanical oil recovery.

Pingxiang furnaces are used more in the south, heating from the top, with coking proceeding from top to bottom. Oil grooves are set at the bottom of the furnace for oil recovery. The Weiyuan Coal Mine Coking Plant in Sichuan has used the Pingxiang furnace to recover oil and has created a relatively complete set of experiences. The average oil recovery rate of this plant is 1.5%, with some reaching 2.2%. Their main experiences are:

I. Preventing Furnace Oil Leakage. When building the furnace bottom, the plant used a mixture of lime and fine furnace slag in a ratio of one to three to build the furnace bottom and oil grooves, about fifteen centimeters thick, repeatedly compacted and then polished with pebbles dipped in brine. Such a furnace bottom has less oil leakage and can be used for about two years. At the same time, in the production process, on the one hand, it is necessary to pay attention to the maintenance of the furnace bottom and oil grooves, brushing with lime water after each coke discharge and cleaning, and repairing cracks at any time; on the other hand, it is necessary to keep the furnace bottom moist, flooding the furnace bottom with cold water for several hours after each coke discharge, which can ensure that the furnace bottom temperature drops and also allow the furnace bottom to absorb water and absorb less oil.

II. Increasing the Area of Oil Grooves. An oil groove is opened every eighty centimeters to one meter along the length of the furnace, with a groove width of fifteen to twenty centimeters. The groove surface is covered with bricks, leaving a narrow gap between the bricks.

III. No Oil Stored at the Bottom of the Furnace. After the coal gas flows from top to bottom through the cold coal seam, a part of the coal tar condenses in the oil grooves. This part of the coal tar should be discharged from the furnace in time. The oil grooves of the plant have a slope of about 0.2%, and coal tar is often carried out from the high end of the oil grooves by passing water.

IV. Using a Fan. This is a very important measure taken by the Weiyuan Coal Mine Coking Plant to improve the oil recovery rate. The experience of other regions is similar. The mechanical oil recovery rate is usually twice as high as the natural draft oil recovery.

In addition, the Weiyuan Coal Mine Coking Plant has another experience in long-term production, that is, good fire, complete coking, and no prolonged coking cycle, so that more oil can be produced.

The experience of the Xinyi Coal Mine in Longchang, Sichuan, is similar to that of Weiyuan. The difference from the Weiyuan Coal Mine Coking is the use of natural draft oil recovery, and the condensation equipment uses clay pipes instead of steel pipes. The oil groove area at the bottom of the Xinyi Coal Mine coke oven accounts for about 20% of the furnace bottom area, and the slope of the oil groove is increased to 0.5% to 0.7%. The oil recovery rate reaches about 1.7%, creating the highest record for natural draft oil recovery in domestic indigenous coking.

In the experience of other places, some are also of certain significance. Such as:

I. Using Coal Gas to Return to the Furnace for Coking. The working group of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry conducted a pilot project in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, and achieved preliminary success. One of the disadvantages of the Pingxiang-style furnace is that the coking rate is slightly lower than that of the Zhongxing-style furnace. In addition to the influence of coal quality, it is due to the heating method, which can be improved after burning self-produced coal gas. Burning self-produced coal gas provides the possibility for further extracting more gas and producing more coal tar. In some places, backfire and explosion occur when burning coal gas, because the coal gas pressure is insufficient and the injection speed is too low, which can be avoided as long as attention is paid.

II. Mechanical Oil Recovery Helps to Coke with Lean Coal. The Xi'an Petroleum Institute used Tongchuan coal, which is not easy to coke, and used mechanical oil recovery to coke into good coke in the Pingxiang-style furnace, and the oil recovery rate was also high. Because the mechanical pumping force is large, the coking temperature and heating speed are increased. This experience proves that oil recovery is not only harmless to coking, but sometimes also beneficial.

There are also some promising practices that are still being explored. Such as:

When natural draft oil recovery is used, how to increase the pumping force is an important issue. Some places light a fire at the bottom of the chimney, which is definitely an effective way to increase the pumping force, but sometimes the chimney explodes at the end of coking. For safety reasons, you can try to light a fire only during the main oil production period and stop lighting a fire at the end of coking. For longer furnaces, you can also try to recover oil from both ends when natural draft oil recovery is used, but the middle of the oil groove should be cut off.

The Zhongxing-style furnace commonly seen in the north is generally round, and there are also rectangular ones. This furnace burns fire from the bottom, and coking proceeds from the surrounding to the center. When recovering oil, lay the exhaust duct in the last coking part of the coal seam. The most suitable position of the exhaust duct is generally explored according to the comparison between the fire penetration time of the gas duct and the coking time.

Just as you must pay attention to the bottom of the furnace when Pingxiang furnace recovers oil, you must pay attention to the top of the furnace cover when Zhongxing furnace recovers oil. Covering the top of the furnace can not only greatly improve the oil recovery rate, but also improve the coking rate and shorten the production cycle.

    ——介绍一束土法炼焦收油经验
    李普庆
    土法炼焦可以在生产焦炭的同时回收焦油。这种焦油是很有价值的轻质石油。今年，各地土法炼焦的产量不小，可以回收数量可观的焦油。目前愈来愈多的土法炼焦厂正在腾出手来抓综合利用（其中主要是收油），以求降低焦炭成本，增加产值。这里介绍一些已有的收油经验，供各地参考。
    目前，我国广泛采用的两种土法炼焦炉是萍乡式的长炉和中兴式的圆炉。这两种炉子都适合于收焦油。它们回收焦油的生产过程是一样的：一是“抽”，就是把带有焦油的煤气从炉内煤层中抽出来；二是“收”，就是通过冷凝设备把焦油从煤气中分出来。靠烟囱吸力来抽煤气的方法，叫做自然抽风收油；靠抽风机来抽煤气的方法叫机械收油。
    萍乡炉在南方采用较多，从上部加热，结焦由上向下进行。收油时在炉底设油沟。四川威远煤矿炼焦厂运用了萍乡炉收油，已创造了一套比较完整的经验，这个厂的平均收油率为1.5％，高的达到2.2％。他们的主要经验是：
    一、防止炉渗油。该厂在建造炉底时，用石灰和细炉渣按一比三的比例混合打炉底及油沟，厚约十五公分，多次打实后用卵石醮卤水磨光。这样的炉底渗油少，可以使用两年左右。同时，在生产过程中，一方面要经常注意炉底和油沟的维护，每次出焦清理后，用石灰水刷浆，有裂缝随时补缝；另一方面要保持炉底润湿，每次出焦后用冷水淹炉底数小时，这样既能保证炉底温度下降，又能使炉底吸水后少吸油。
    二、增大油沟面积。沿炉长方向每隔八十公分至一公尺开一条油沟，沟宽十五至二十公分。沟面盖砖，砖与砖之间留一窄缝。
    三、炉底不存油。煤气自上向下流经冷煤层后，焦油有一部分冷凝在油沟中。这部分焦油要及时引出炉外。该厂的油沟有0.2％左右的坡度，经常从油沟高的一端通水带出焦油。
    四、采用抽风机。这是威远煤矿炼焦厂提高收油率的一项很重要的措施。其他各地的经验与此相仿，机械收油率通常比自然抽风收油要高出一倍。
    此外，威远煤矿炼焦厂在长期生产中，还有一条经验，就是火烧得好，结焦到底，炼焦周期不拖长，油才能出得多。
    四川隆昌信义煤矿的经验与威远类似，跟威远煤矿炼焦不同的是用自然抽风收油，冷凝设备用瓦管代替钢管。信义煤矿焦炉底油沟面积占炉底面积20％左右，油沟斜度加大到0.5％到0.7％。收油率达到1.7％左右，创目前全国土法炼焦自然抽风收油的最高纪录。
    在其他地方的经验中，还有一些也有一定的意义。如：
    一、利用煤气回炉炼焦。石油工业部工作组在河北省石家庄搞了试点，获得初步成功。萍乡式炉的一个缺点是结焦率略低于中兴式炉，除了煤质的影响之外，是由于加热方式的缘故，在烧自产煤气后就可以得到提高。烧自产煤气为进一步多抽出烧气，多产焦油提供了可能性。有些地方烧煤气时发生回火放炮，是由于煤气压力不足，喷出速度太低的缘故，只要注意就可以避免。
    二、机械收油有助于用瘦煤炼焦。西安石油学院用不易成焦的铜川煤，使用机械收油在萍乡式炉内炼成好焦，收油率也高。因为使用机械抽力较大，提高了结焦温度及加热速度。这一经验证明，收油不但对炼焦无害，有时还能有利。
    也有一些颇有意义，尚在摸索的作法。如：
    自然抽风收油时，如何增加抽力是一个重要问题。有的地方在烟囱底部生火，这肯定是一项增加抽力的有效方法，但是在成焦末期有时烟囱发生爆裂。为安全起见，可以试行只在主要出油期生火，成焦末期停止生火的办法。比较长的炉，在自然抽风收油时，也可以试用两端收油，但油沟中部应当隔断。
    北方常见的中兴式炉，一般为圆形，也有长方形的。这种炉从下部烧火，结焦从四周向中心进行。收油时在煤层中最后成焦处铺设抽气道。抽气道的最合适位置，一般的根据煤气道透火时间和成焦时间对比来摸索。
    正像萍乡炉收油必须注意炉底一样，中兴炉收油必须注意炉盖顶。炉子盖顶的，不仅可以使收油率大大提高，还可以使成焦率提高，生产周期缩短。
