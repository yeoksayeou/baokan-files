Heilongjiang - All Aspects of Spring Plowing Preparation Moving Forward Simultaneously
Jilin - Rushing to Accumulate Fertilizer While Intensifying Spring Plowing Preparation

    This newspaper's Harbin dispatch, 19th - Heilongjiang Province's farmers will work hard, struggle hard, and work skillfully for forty days before the early spring plowing and sowing at the end of March this year, to fight the first battle for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in this year's agricultural production.

    Currently, although Heilongjiang Province is covered with ice and snow, the battle of spring plowing preparation has been fully launched, focusing on accumulating more manure fertilizer, producing more humic acid fertilizer, and delivering manure, while also seizing the time for water conservancy construction, tool reform, careful seed selection, and land preparation and ridging, so that all aspects of spring plowing preparation are advancing simultaneously. At present, 80% of the province's cultivated land has already been autumn-tilled, preparing nearly 10,000 catties of manure fertilizer for each mu of cultivated land; water conservancy projects have increased more than tenfold compared to the same period last year, more than 240,000 pieces of various tools have been created and reformed, and the selected and preserved seeds are already sufficient for sowing needs. The people's communes are exchanging seeds with each other according to the needs of the sowing area of various crops.

    In 1958, when the snow was heavy and spring was late, this province sowed twenty days earlier than in previous years, winning time to increase the number of hoeing and weeding, making the crops mature and harvest early, and threshing and delivering grain also became active step by step because of being early in everything. This year, the snow is light and the spring is early. The Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee has issued an emergency mobilization order for spring plowing preparation, and the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has also held a telephone conference to specifically deploy spring plowing preparation work. A large number of cadres will go deep into the countryside to lead the masses to launch a high tide of spring plowing preparation.

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch - The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a broadcast conference on the 14th, calling for a rapid upsurge in spring plowing preparation.

    Wu De, First Secretary of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out to the 2.5 million cadres and masses listening to the broadcast: We must seize the season and promptly do all the preparatory work for spring plowing production. This is the first hurdle in striving for a great agricultural harvest this year. In the spring plowing preparation stage, we must earnestly implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture.

    Wu De also pointed out: While vigorously rushing to accumulate fertilizer and deliver manure, we must also seize the time to do a good job in land preparation, seed preparation, water conservancy construction, and other work. Jilin Province will also launch two mass-based "ten-thousand-person spring plowing preparation inspections" recently, and organize competitions between counties, communes, management areas, and teams.

    黑龙江——各项备耕工作齐头并进
    吉林——突击积肥同时加紧备耕
    本报哈尔滨19日电　黑龙江省农民要在今年3月底提早春耕播种前，大干、苦干、巧干四十天，为今年农业生产更大、更好、更全面的跃进打好第一仗。
    目前黑龙江省虽然冰雪满地，可是备耕战斗已全面展开，以多积粪肥、多造士化肥和送粪为中心，同时抓紧水利施工、工具改革、精选种子和整地起垅，使各项备耕工作齐头并进。现在，全省80％的耕地已经秋翻，为每亩耕地准备粪肥近一万斤；水利工程比去年同时期增加了十倍多，创造和改革的各种工具有二十四万多件，精选保存的种子已经足够播种需要。各人民公社正按照各种作物播种面积的需要，互相串换种子。
    在雪大春迟的1958年，这个省比历年提早二十天播种，赢得时间增加了铲趟次数，使作物早熟丰收，打场、送粮也因为一早百早，步步主动。今年雪小春早，黑龙江省人民委员会已发出紧急备耕动员令，中共黑龙江省委又召开电话会议具体部署备耕工作，大批干部将深入农村领导群众掀起备耕高潮。

    据新华社讯　中共吉林省委在14日召开广播大会，号召迅速掀起备耕高潮。
    中共吉林省委第一书记吴德向二百五十万收听广播的干部群众指出：必须抓住季节，及时做好春耕生产的一切准备工作，这是争取今年农业大丰收的第一关。在春耕准备阶段，要切实贯彻农业“八字宪法”。
    吴德还指出：当前在大力突击积肥送粪的同时，还得抓紧作好整地、种子准备、水利建设等工作。吉林省最近还要开展两次群众性的万人备耕大检查，并组织县与县、社与社、管理区与管理区、队与队的评比竞赛。
