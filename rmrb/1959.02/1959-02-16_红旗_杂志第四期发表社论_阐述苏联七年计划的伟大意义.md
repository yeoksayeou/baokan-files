Xinhua News Agency, February 15th: The semi-monthly magazine "Red Flag" published in its fourth issue of 1959 an editorial entitled "A Bugle Call for Marching Towards Communism," as well as Ke Qingshi's "On 'The Whole Country as a Coordinated Chessboard'," Tan Zhenlin's "Striving for a Greater Bumper Harvest This Summer" (Editor's note: The articles by Ke Qingshi and Tan Zhenlin will be reprinted in full in this newspaper soon), Yu Zhaoli's "Dulles' Fairy Tale and China's Reality," Yang Chengwu's "On Cadres Enlisting as Soldiers," and articles such as Ai Siqi's "The Dialectic of the Infinite and the Finite," and Chen Maoyi's "Correctly Dealing with Rules and Regulations," two short essays.

The editorial, "A Bugle Call for Marching Towards Communism," pointed out that the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will be recorded in the annals of the communist movement as a new milestone for humanity's advance towards communism. The editorial stated that the report and concluding remarks made by Comrade Khrushchev at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as well as the resolutions adopted by the Congress, summarized the rich experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and put forward a grand program for the comprehensive development of communist construction in the Soviet Union. It is not difficult for people to see from the nationwide upsurge of enthusiastic labor competition in the Soviet Union that the great seven-year plan is bound to be victoriously realized. Now, even some bourgeois figures in Western countries cannot deny that the Soviet people are advancing with full confidence.

The editorial also pointed out that in order to transition to communism, not only a high degree of material and technological foundation is needed, but also the communist consciousness of the working people needs to be raised. Therefore, the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union particularly emphasized the great significance of enhancing the creativity, initiative, and activeness of the masses, and linked communist moral education with the task of building communism.

The editorial then pointed out that the Soviet Union's seven-year plan has brought the economic competition between socialism and capitalism into a new stage. The incomparable superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system and the solidarity and mutual assistance among socialist countries guarantee the high-speed development of the economies of socialist countries. The general crisis of capitalism is deepening further, and imperialist countries are increasingly moving towards disintegration. The days when the United States is left at the "wrong station" by the Soviet Union are definitely not far away.

The editorial said that all peace-loving countries and people in the world see that the Soviet Union's seven-year plan is full of a spirit of peace-loving. The realization of the seven-year plan will certainly play an extremely great role in safeguarding world peace.

The editorial also discussed the major contributions of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in its discussions and resolutions on a number of international issues: such as pointing out that the reactionary bourgeoisie in some countries have turned to open dictatorial rule, which is a sign of its weakness; continuing to put forward a series of proposals to ease international tensions; reminding nations striving for independence that they can only achieve true victory by uniting all anti-imperialist forces at home and abroad to fight together, and so on. The editorial then pointed out the great significance of the elaboration of the new stage of communist construction and certain issues of Marxist-Leninist theory in the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and in Comrade Khrushchev's report. These issues include the two stages of communism, the issue of highly developing social productive forces and increasing labor productivity, the issue of distributing social production's material and spiritual wealth among all members of society, the issue of planned and organized labor distribution in communist society, the issue of the merging of collective ownership and ownership by the whole people into one, the issue of the political organization and state institutions and management of society during the period of comprehensively developing communist construction, and the relationship between the universal laws and particularities of the transition to communism.

The editorial also pointed out that the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union powerfully shattered the attempts of the imperialist reactionaries and the Yugoslav revisionists to provoke and undermine the friendly and cooperative relations between China and the Soviet Union. The editorial said: We Chinese Communists will continue to adhere to learning from the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union and will continue to struggle to further consolidate and strengthen the great friendship between our two parties.

The editorial concluded by saying that the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was a congress that marked new victories and enhanced militant unity in the international communist movement. Through this congress, people can clearly see that it will not be too long before the banner of communism, "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs," will fly in the skies of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp. This banner will attract the working people of the world with infinite power and shake the tottering rule of imperialism.

    “红旗”杂志第四期发表社论  
    阐述苏联七年计划的伟大意义
    同期发表“论全国一盘棋”和“争取今年夏季更大的丰收”等论文
    据新华社15日讯　“红旗”半月刊1959年第四期发表了题为“向共产主义进军的号角”的社论和柯庆施的“论‘全国一盘棋’”，谭震林的“争取今年夏季更大的丰收”（编者按，柯庆施和谭震林的文章，本报即将全文转载），于兆力的“杜勒斯的童话和中国的真实”，杨成武的“谈干部当兵”等文章；还发表了艾思奇的“无限和有限的辩证法”，陈茂仪的“正确地对待规章制度”等两篇短论。
    “向共产主义进军的号角”的社论指出：苏共第二十一次代表大会，将作为人类向共产主义前进的新的里程碑，记载在共产主义运动的史册上。社论说：赫鲁晓夫同志在苏共第二十一次代表大会所作的报告和总结发言，以及大会所通过的决议，总结了苏联社会主义建设的丰富经验，提出了苏联全面展开共产主义建设的宏伟纲领。代表大会所通过的七年计划，正是这个纲领的最重要部分。人们从苏联全国各地热火朝天的劳动竞赛高潮中间不难看到，伟大的七年计划是一定要胜利实现的。现在，就连西方国家的某些资产阶级人士也不能否认苏联人民在满怀信心地前进。
    社论还指出，为了过渡到共产主义，不仅需要高度的物质技术基础，而且需要提高劳动人民的共产主义觉悟。因此，苏共第二十一次代表大会特别强调提高人民群众的创造性、主动性和积极性的重大意义，而且把共产主义道德教育同建设共产主义的任务联系起来。
    社论接着指出：苏联的七年计划，使社会主义同资本主义的经济竞赛进入了一个新阶段。社会主义制度对于资本主义制度的不可比拟的优越性，社会主义各国间的团结互助，保证了社会主义国家经济高速度的发展。资本主义的总危机正在进一步加深，帝国主义国家之间正在日益走向四分五裂。美国被苏联丢在“错车站”上的日子，肯定是不会很远了。
    社论说，全世界爱好和平的国家和人民，都看到苏联的七年计划充满着爱好和平的精神。七年计划的实现，对于维护世界和平一定会起极其巨大的作用。
    社论还论述了苏共第二十一次代表大会在讨论和决议中对一些国际问题的重大贡献：如指出一些国家反动的资产阶级转而采取了公开的独裁统治是它的软弱的标志；继续提出一系列缓和国际紧张局势的主张；提醒争取独立的民族只有团结国内外一切反帝国主义的力量共同奋斗，才能取得真正胜利，等等。社论接着指出苏共第二十一次代表大会决议和赫鲁晓夫同志报告中关于共产主义建设新阶段和马克思列宁主义理论若干问题阐述的重大意义。这些问题包括共产主义的两个阶段的问题、高度地发展社会生产力和提高劳动生产率的问题、社会生产的物质财富和精神财富在社会全体成员中间分配的问题、共产主义社会有计划有组织地进行劳动分配的问题、集体所有制和全民所有制两种所有制融合为一的问题、全面展开共产主义建设时期社会的政治组织与国家机构和管理问题、向共产主义过渡的普遍规律和特殊性的关系问题等。
    社论还指出：苏共第二十一次代表大会，有力地粉碎了帝国主义反动派和南斯拉夫修正主义者对于中苏友好合作关系的挑拨和破坏。社论说：我们中国共产党人将继续坚持向伟大的苏联共产党学习，并且为了进一步巩固和加强我们两党之间的伟大的友谊而继续奋斗。
    社论最后说：苏共第二十一次代表大会是表示国际共产主义运动取得新的胜利、增强战斗团结的一次大会。通过这次大会，人们可以清楚地看到，不要太久的时间，“各尽所能、按需分配”的共产主义的旗帜，就将飘扬在苏联和整个社会主义阵营的天空。这面旗帜将以无限的力量吸引全世界劳动人民，震撼摇摇欲坠的帝国主义的统治。
