Why the Fanfani Cabinet Resigned
Xi Linsheng

The Fanfani cabinet of the Italian Christian Democratic Party, which had been in power for more than six months, resigned on January 26, bringing Italy to a new government crisis.

The direct cause of the Fanfani government crisis was the resignation of Labor Minister Virgilieri of the Social Democratic Party, who insisted on resigning because he disagreed with the party's right-wing leadership merging with the Christian Democratic Party. Thus, Fanfani had to decide to submit his resignation to President Gronchi at the cabinet meeting on the 26th.

The resignation of the Fanfani cabinet actually reflects the increasingly developing and deepening political crisis in Italy.

The Fanfani Cabinet Was Born Deficient

The Fanfani cabinet, from the first day of its formation, was built on sand. The results of the general election in May last year showed that the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party, which advocated changing the current policies of the Christian Democratic Party government, received 11 million votes, and the Christian Democratic Party's plan to obtain an absolute majority in the parliament failed. This proves that the Italian people hope to change the country's foreign and domestic policies. However, the Christian Democratic Party still ignored this new situation after the general election, stubbornly attempted to monopolize power, and continued to pursue policies that violated national interests. However, the Christian Democratic Party encountered considerable difficulties in continuing to monopolize power. Some middle-of-the-road parties that had participated in the coalition government were unwilling to partner with it again. After a long delay, a two-party government headed by Fanfani, the general secretary of the Christian Democratic Party, and with the participation of the Social Democratic Party, was cobbled together. These two parties occupied less than half of the seats in parliament. For six months, the Fanfani cabinet has been in a precarious situation. Three times the proposals it submitted to parliament were rejected, and even members of the Christian Democratic Party voted against the government. In several votes of confidence, the Fanfani cabinet could only obtain an extremely slight majority, and not long ago, in the House of Representatives vote of confidence on January 23, it only obtained a majority of one vote. This one vote was obtained when four members of the Italian Communist Party were absent from the 21st Congress of the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow. At the same time, before Virgilieri resigned, two Christian Democratic Party ministers in the Fanfani cabinet had already resigned one after another. All this shows that the Fanfani cabinet has long lost its foundation for existence.

Clerical Rule is Unpopular

Like the downfall of previous Christian Democratic Party governments, the resignation of the Fanfani cabinet proves that the domestic and foreign policies pursued by the Christian Democratic Party have become increasingly unpopular. Domestically, the Fanfani cabinet implemented the dictatorship of landlords, big bourgeoisie, and clerical factions, and stepped up its offensive against the democratic and freedom rights of the people. In foreign policy, the Fanfani government supported the US and British imperialist aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, and turned Italy's airports and ports into springboards for the US aggressors to enter the Middle East. Moreover, the Fanfani government, disregarding national interests, agreed to the United States establishing medium-range missile bases on Italian territory, posing a serious threat to Italian security. Economically, due to the impact of the economic crisis in the United States and the capitalist world, Italy's industrial production has experienced stagnation and a downward trend. Production in many industrial sectors has been reduced, and the army of unemployed remains at a record high of more than 1.8 million. As a result of inflation, prices have risen by an average of 8% in the past year, which has seriously affected people's lives. All this has aroused deep dissatisfaction among the Italian people with the Fanfani government. More and more people are participating in the wave of various political struggles organized by the Italian Communist Party and other progressive parties. In the six months that the Fanfani government was in power, the Italian people's movement against US and British aggression in the Middle East, against the establishment of missile bases on Italian territory, and for peace, as well as the strike struggles of workers and peasants, reached unprecedented heights. In particular, the strike movement has been almost continuous, and its scale has become larger and larger, with millions of people participating in the strikes. This series of waves of struggles for peace and strikes severely impacted the shaky Fanfani cabinet.

Serious Division within the Ruling Group

Another reason for the resignation of the Fanfani cabinet was the division within the ruling group, first of all the split between the Christian Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party within the coalition government. Within the Christian Democratic Party, due to the changes in the international situation that were unfavorable to the imperialist camp, the impact of the US economic crisis, and the rise of the domestic people's movement against the Fanfani government, the struggle between the three forces in the party intensified.

Some of them were dissatisfied with Fanfani's policies and began to show a tendency to turn to the left, which was particularly evident in the events in Sicily. The ruling party of the Sicilian local government, the Christian Democratic Party, recently formed a "left-leaning" government with the support of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party. The headquarters of the Christian Democratic Party was very angry about this and even fired the secretary of the local party organization. However, these "rebels" simply formed a new political party called the "Sicilian Catholic-Socialist League." This trend in Sicily made the Italian reactionaries and the American newspapers greatly alarmed. Another group, mainly representing the interests of national monopoly capital, saw that the world situation was weakening US leadership, and therefore wanted to take the opportunity to get rid of some US control and open up a path for themselves. They desperately expanded to the Middle East and Latin America to seize oil resources in these regions. The main figures in this faction are President Gronchi and Fanfani. However, they were attacked by another powerful pro-American faction within the party, such as Sherba and Bella. The American press also continuously put pressure on these people. The increasing contradictions within the Christian Democratic Party put Fanfani in a situation where he was constantly attacked from both sides. Even his Christian Democratic Party members in parliament continued to "shoot cold arrows" and voted against the government of the general secretary. It was precisely because of this situation that Fanfani, after resigning as Prime Minister, then resolutely resigned as General Secretary of the Christian Democratic Party. This reflects the intensification of the crisis of division within the core of this clerical ruling group.

The Social Democratic Party, which participated in the Fanfani government, was also divided into two factions on the issue of relations with the Socialist Party. One faction saw the rising tide of popular dissatisfaction with the Christian Democratic Party government and tried its best to get rid of the Christian Democratic Party and merge with the Socialist Party, and even considered forming a government with the Socialist Party. After the 33rd Congress of the Socialist Party recently, it further promoted the actions of this faction to strive for the merger of the two parties. This faction, headed by the second leader, Matteotti, has a considerable influence in the Central Committee. Labor Minister Virgilieri, who resigned, belonged to this faction, and his resignation was precisely out of the above considerations. The other faction, headed by the General Secretary of the Social Democratic Party, Saragat, believed that the split between the Nenni faction of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party was not thorough enough and should not rush to merge with the Socialist Party, but should continue to form a coalition government with the Christian Democratic Party. Therefore, they were extremely dissatisfied with Virgilieri's resignation. A few days ago, five members of the Social Democratic Party announced their withdrawal from the party, intending to oppose any Christian Democratic Party-led government together with Nenni's Socialist Party, which on the one hand promoted the split of the Social Democratic Party; on the other hand, it will make the most serious political crisis in Italy since the war more complicated.

Government Crisis Continues to Deepen

Now, more than half a month has passed since Fanfani submitted his resignation. Although President Gronchi tried desperately to find a new candidate for prime minister, it is still nowhere in sight. In order to temporarily solve the current difficulties, Gronchi rejected Fanfani's resignation and requested that Parliament hold a vote of confidence on the issue of the Fanfani cabinet's resignation. But Fanfani stubbornly refused to withdraw his government's request for resignation. Even Western news agencies admit that the current "crisis is very serious." Agence France-Presse even said: "President Gronchi certainly believes that the problem is not only the issue of candidates, but also the issue of the program." Moreover, Gronchi's communique also mentioned: "President Gronchi must not allow the situation to become such that the system is in danger." It is said that the communique said this because "the President believes that the current situation may contain a threat of this danger." This proves that the current Italian government crisis is further deepening.

In response to the behind-the-scenes conspiracies of various bourgeois parties, the Italian Communist Party issued a statement on January 28 emphasizing that the cabinet crisis can only be resolved by relying on the cooperation of left-wing parties. The Italian Communist Party's position fully reflects the wishes and demands of the broad masses of Italian working people. In recent days, working people in many cities in Italy have held mass rallies and various gatherings, and passed resolutions demanding the organization of a new government of progress, peace, and freedom. However, it seems that the Italian authorities are not prepared to consider this legitimate demand of the people. There are reports that they are still trying to organize a so-called "centrist" coalition cabinet, which is basically controlled by the Christian Democratic Party, or even a minority Christian Democratic Party cabinet, in order to clean up the situation. But can this help improve the situation? The Fanfani cabinet crisis, like past short-lived Christian Democratic Party governments, reflects that in the current domestic and international situation, the Christian Democratic Party's policies that violate national interests are increasingly unworkable.

    范范尼内阁为什么辞职
    席林生
    上台六个多月的意大利天主教民主党范范尼内阁已在上月26日辞职，从而使意大利又一次面临新的政府危机。
    造成范范尼政府危机的直接原因，是劳工部长、社会民主党人维尔雷里因为不同意党的右翼领导同天主教民主党合流而坚持辞职。于是范范尼不得不在26日内阁会议上决定向总统格隆基提出辞职。
    范范尼内阁的辞职，实际上反映了意大利日趋发展和深刻化的政治危机。
    范范尼内阁先天不足
    范范尼内阁从它组成后的第一天起，就是建立在沙滩上的。去年5月大选的结果，意大利共产党和主张改变天主教民主党政府现行政策的社会党得到了一千一百万选票，而天主教民主党预谋在议会中取得绝对多数的计划遭到了失败。这证明意大利人民希望改变国家的外交和内政政策。但是，天主教民主党仍然无视大选后出现的这种新的形势，顽固地企图垄断政权，以继续推行它们违反民族利益的政策。然而天主教民主党在继续垄断政权的事情上遇到了不小的困难。一些过去参加联合政府的中间党派不愿再跟它合伙。在拖延了很长时间之后，才拼凑起以天主教民主党总书记范范尼为首的、有社会民主党参加的两党政府。这两党政府在议会中占有席位连半数也不到。六个月来范范尼内阁始终处于风雨飘摇之中。它三次向议会提出的提案，都被否决，投票反对政府的甚至有天主教民主党的议员。在好几次信任投票中，范范尼内阁也只能得到极其微弱的多数，不久前在1月23日的众议院信任投票中甚至只得到了一票的多数。而这一票还是在意大利共产党四个众议员赴莫斯科出席苏共二十一次代表大会而缺席的情况下取得的。与此同时，在维尔雷里辞职之前，范范尼内阁的两位天主教民主党部长就已先后提出了辞职。这一切表明范范尼内阁是早已失去了存在的基础了。
      教权统治不得人心
    像过去历届天主教民主党政府的倒台一样，范范尼内阁的辞职证明天主教民主党所执行的国内外政策已经越来越不得人心。范范尼内阁对内执行地主、大资产阶级和教权派的专政，加紧向人民的民主和自由权利进攻。在对外政策上，范范尼政府支持美英帝国主义对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略，并且把意大利的飞机场和港口变成美国侵略军开入中东的跳板。而且范范尼政府还不顾民族利益，同意美国在意大利领土上设立中程导弹基地，造成了对意大利安全的严重威胁。在经济上，由于美国和资本主义世界的经济危机的影响，意大利的工业生产发生了停滞和下降的趋势，许多工业部门的生产缩减，失业大军仍然保持一百八十多万人的最高纪录。由于通货膨胀的结果，一年来物价平均上涨了8％。使人民生活受到严重影响。这一切引起意大利人民对范范尼政府的深刻的不满。越来越多的人民参加到意大利共产党和其他进步政党所组织的各种政治斗争的浪潮中去。在范范尼政府当权的半年中，意大利人民反对美英侵略中东、反对在意大利领土上建立导弹基地的争取和平的运动，以及工人和农民的罢工斗争空前地高涨。特别是罢工运动几乎连绵不断，而且规模越来越大，参加罢工的群众多达几百万人。这一系列的争取和平和罢工斗争的浪潮，严厉地冲击着摇摆不稳的范范尼内阁。
    统治集团严重分化
    导致范范尼内阁辞职的另一个原因，是统治集团内部的分裂，首先是联合政府内部天主教民主党和社会民主党的分裂。在天主教民主党内，由于国际形势发生不利于帝国主义阵营的变化、美国经济危机的影响以及国内人民反对范范尼政府运动的高涨，加剧了该党三种势力的斗争。
    其中一部分人不满范范尼的政策，开始表现出向左转的倾向，这在西西里岛的事件中特别明显地表现出来。西西里岛地方政府的执政党天主教民主党不久前依靠共产党和社会党的支持，组成了一个“左倾趋势”的政府。天主教民主党总部对此十分恼怒，竟开除了该地方党组织的书记。可是这些“反叛者”索性成立了一个“西西里天主教—社会党联盟”的新政党。西西里岛上的这种趋势使得意大利的反动派和美国报纸大为惊慌。另一部分主要是代表国家垄断资本的利益的人，他们看到世界局势正在削弱美国的领导权，因而想乘机摆脱一些美国的控制，为自己打开一条出路。他们在国外拼命向中东和拉丁美洲地区进行扩张，企图攫取这些地区的石油资源。这一派中主要人物是总统格隆基和范范尼。但是他们受到党内另一派有势力的极端亲美派如谢尔巴、贝拉等的攻击。美国报刊也连续对这部分人施加压力。天主教民主党内部的矛盾的增长，使范范尼经常处于左右两面夹攻之中。甚至他的天主教民主党的议员在议会中也不断“放冷箭”，投票反对这个总书记的政府。正是由于这种情况，范范尼在辞掉内阁总理职务之后，接着又坚决辞去了天主教民主党总书记的职务。这反映了在这个教权统治集团的核心内部的分裂危机的尖锐化。
    参加范范尼政府的社会民主党在同社会党的关系问题上，也分成了两派。一派看到目前广大人民对天主教民主党政府的不满情绪的高涨，就竭力企图摆脱天主教民主党而同社会党合并，甚至考虑和社会党合组政府。最近在社会党举行的第三十三次代表大会之后，更促进了这一派人争取两党合并的行动。这一派人以第二号领袖马特奥蒂为首在中央委员会中占有不小的势力。提出辞职的劳工部长维尔雷里就属于这一派，他的辞职也正是出于上述的考虑。而以社会民主党总书记萨拉盖特为首的另一派，认为目前社会党南尼派同共产党的决裂还不够彻底，不应当忙着和社会党合并，应当继续跟天主教民主党搞联合政府。因此他们极不满意维尔雷里的辞职。前几天，五名社会民主党的议员宣布退党，打算同南尼的社会党一起反对任何天主教民主党领导的政府，这就一方面促成了社会民主党的分裂；另一方面将使意大利战后以来最严重的政治危机更加复杂化。
    政府危机继续加深
    现在，自范范尼提出辞职以来已经半个月多了。尽管格隆基总统拼命物色新总理人选，但是至今渺茫无着。为了暂时解决目前的困难，格隆基拒绝范范尼辞职，并且要求议会就范范尼内阁辞职问题举行信任投票。但是范范尼却偏不肯撤回他的政府的辞职要求。这种情况连西方通讯社也承认，目前“危机十分严重”。法新社甚至说：“格隆基总统肯定问题不仅是人选问题，也是纲领问题”。而且格隆基的公报还提到：“格隆基总统决不能让情况变得使制度发生危险”。据说公报这样说是因为“总统相信当前局势可能包含着这种危险的威胁”。这证明目前意大利政府危机正在进一步走向深刻化。
    针对着各资产阶级政党在幕后的阴谋活动，意大利共产党1月28日发表了一项声明强调指出，只有依靠左翼各政党的合作才能解决内阁危机。意共的这个立场充分反映了意大利广大劳动人民的愿望和要求。连日来意大利许多城市的劳动人民纷纷举行了群众大会和各种集会，并且通过决议，要求组织一个进步、和平和自由的新政府。但是，看来意大利当局不准备考虑人民的这种正当要求。有消息说，它们仍然企图组织一个基本上由天主教民主党控制的所谓“中间派”联合内阁，甚至是一个少数派的天主教民主党一党内阁也好，以便收拾一下局面。但是，这能有助于局势好转吗？范范尼内阁危机和过去历届寿命不长的天主教民主党政府一样，反映了在当前国内外形势下，天主教民主党的违反民族利益的政策已经越来越行不通了。
