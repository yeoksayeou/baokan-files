    China-Bulgaria Volleyball First Friendly Match
    Sofia Women's Team Wins, Men's Team Loses
    (Our dispatch) The Bulgarian Sofia city men's and women's volleyball teams, who are visiting our country at our invitation, played their first friendly matches in our country yesterday afternoon at the Beijing Gymnasium against the Chinese youth men's and women's volleyball teams. As a result, the visiting women's team defeated the Chinese youth women's team by three to one, and the visiting men's team lost to the Chinese youth men's team by one to three.

    Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi watched yesterday's game. Bulgarian Ambassador to China Panchevsky and his wife, as well as embassy staff, were also invited to watch the game.

    The women's team match was held first. Due to the home team's lack of effective blocking, the first and second games were lost to the visiting team, which was good at long-range spiking, by fifteen to eleven and nineteen to seventeen respectively. Later, the Chinese youth women's team pulled back a game by fifteen to twelve, but lost the fourth game again by fifteen to twelve. In this friendly match, the visiting team's Timcheva, who is one meter and seventy-seven centimeters tall, and the home team's Wang Zishu, who is one meter and seventy-six and a half centimeters tall, both performed excellently with their powerful spikes.

    The men's team match proceeded at a fast pace. Both sides launched fierce offensives. The home team adopted powerful serves to disrupt the visiting team's first pass many times, making it difficult for the visiting team's specialty, "two spikes," to be effective. As a result, the home team won fifteen to ten, seven to fifteen, fifteen to five, and fifteen to twelve.

    中保排球第一场友谊赛
    索非亚市女队胜男队败
    本报讯　应邀来我国访问的保加利亚索非亚市男女排球队，昨天下午在北京体育馆同中国青年男女排球队作了来我国的第一次友谊比赛。结果客队女队以三比一胜中国青年女子队，客队男队以一比三败给中国青年男子队。
    周恩来总理和陈毅副总理兼外交部长观看了昨天的比赛。保加利亚驻中国大使潘切夫斯基和他的夫人，以及使馆人员也应邀观看了比赛。
    首先进行的是女子队的比赛。由于主队缺乏有效的拦网，第一局和第二局分别以十五比十一和十九比十七败给了善于远网扣球的客队。后来中国青年女子队以十五比十二扳回一局，但第四局又以十五比十二失败。在这场友谊比赛中，客队身高一公尺七十七公分的季姆契娃和主队身高一公尺七十六公分半的王子淑的猛力扣球，都很出色。
    男子队的比赛以很快的速度进行。双方队员都展开猛烈的攻势。主队采取了大力发球多次破坏了客队的第一次传球，使客队擅长的“两次扣球”很难发挥。结果十五比十、七比十五、十五比五和十五比十二主队获胜。
