Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, February 26th. The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published a commentary on the 24th, refuting with facts the slanderous case plotted by the Yugoslav government in Prizren. In this case, Yugoslavia slandered Albania for dispatching its citizen Hafiz Hoxha (who is actually an experienced agent of the Yugoslav State Security Administration) to engage in espionage activities. The Yugoslav revisionists fabricated facts, insisting that this Yugoslav agent had handed over information about Yugoslavia's economy and armed forces to the Albanian Embassy in Yugoslavia.

The commentary stated that Hoxha is an enemy of the Albanian people. He fled to Yugoslavia in 1953. There, after finding his brother, who had fled to Yugoslavia long ago and was working for the Yugoslav State Security Administration, he also became an agent of this organization. In 1957, Albania announced an amnesty decree, and Hoxha returned to Albania in accordance with the instructions of the Yugoslav State Security Administration. However, he left his entire family in Yugoslavia. This was probably because the Yugoslav agents wanted to use his family as hostages. When Hoxha returned to Albania, he received all the conveniences in accordance with the amnesty decree, returned to his hometown, and obtained a job. However, he soon began to carry out the mission assigned to him by the Yugoslav State Security Administration, but he could not find a suitable area to complete this mission. When he saw that his activities were about to be exposed, he fled again in 1958 to the place that sent him - Yugoslavia.

The commentary pointed out that it is clear that the Yugoslav government is trying to cover up its long-standing anti-Albanian policy with slander, to cover up its series of actions interfering in our internal affairs and the conspiracy of sending its agents to Albania, and to cover up the espionage activities of the Yugoslav State Security Administration and the Yugoslav diplomatic personnel in Albania with slander. It would take many pages to describe the series of hostile activities of the Yugoslav State Security Administration and the Yugoslav diplomatic personnel in Albania.

The commentary then revealed the facts of Yugoslav diplomatic personnel in Albania openly conducting propaganda against the Albanian Party and state system, taking photos in restricted areas without permission, attempting to buy off agents, and the Yugoslav government's oppression of the Albanian minority within its borders. The commentary emphasized that the Yugoslav State Security Administration will not stop using these tricks, because this is precisely the task given to the Yugoslav revisionists by their American masters. These provocative activities once again show your true face - the face of a lackey.

    南斯拉夫政府贼喊捉贼
    阿“人民之声报”载文驳斥
    新华社地拉那26日电　阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”24日在一篇评论里用事实驳斥了南斯拉夫政府在普利斯伦市策划的诬告案，在这个案件里南斯拉夫诬蔑阿尔巴尼亚派遣它的公民哈菲兹·霍克哈（其实他是南斯拉夫国家保安处有经验的特务）从事间谍活动。南斯拉夫修正主义者捏造事实，硬说这个南斯拉夫的特务曾经把南斯拉夫的经济和武装部队的情报交给阿尔巴尼亚驻南斯拉夫公使馆。
    评论说，霍克哈是阿尔巴尼亚人民的敌人。他在1953年逃往南斯拉夫。在那里，他找到了很早以前逃到南斯拉夫、并且为南斯拉夫国家保安处工作的兄弟之后，也就成为了这个组织的特务。1957年阿尔巴尼亚宣布大赦令，霍克哈遵照南斯拉夫国家保安处的指示返回阿尔巴尼亚。但是他却把全家都留在了南斯拉夫。这大概是南斯拉夫的特务们要把他的家庭作为人质。当霍克哈回到阿尔巴尼亚之后，按照大赦令他得到了一切便利，返回了家乡，并且获得了工作。但是不久他就开始执行南斯拉夫国家保安处交给他的使命，可是他却没有找到适当的地区来完成这一使命。并且在他看到自己的活动即将被揭露的时候，在1958年再度逃往派他来的地方——南斯拉夫。
    评论指出，大家明白，南斯拉夫政府正是想以诬蔑来掩盖它长久以来一直反对阿尔巴尼亚的政策，掩盖它一系列干涉我国内政的行动和派遣它的特务来阿尔巴尼亚的阴谋，想以诬蔑掩盖南斯拉夫国家保安处和南斯拉夫驻阿尔巴尼亚外交人员的特务活动。南斯拉夫国家保安处和南斯拉夫驻阿尔巴尼亚外交人员的一系列的敌对活动是要用许多篇幅才能叙述完的。
    评论接着揭露了南斯拉夫驻阿尔巴尼亚外交人员公开进行反对阿尔巴尼亚党和国家制度的宣传，不经允许就私自往禁区拍摄照片和企图收买特务以及南斯拉夫政府压迫在它的境内的阿尔巴尼亚少数民族的事实。评论强调指出，南斯拉夫国家保安处是不会停止使用这些伎俩的，因为这正是美国老爷们给与南斯拉夫修正主义者的任务。这种挑衅活动只不过再一次表现了你们真正的嘴脸——奴仆的嘴脸而已。
