This Dispatch from Wuhan, February 27th: Guanghua County, Hubei Province, which shone brilliantly in agricultural production last year, has recently formulated an even greater leap forward plan for agricultural production this year. According to this plan, the total output, average yield per mu, and total value of agricultural and sideline production of all agricultural products in the county this year will double on the basis of last year. After the plan is realized, the county will reach the following average level per capita: 3,000 jin of grain, 1,000 jin of seed cotton, 100 jin of oil, 100 jin of fish, 1,000 jin of vegetables, one and a half pigs, equivalent to 1,000 yuan in cash. The people of the county are fighting unremittingly with soaring enthusiasm to realize the leap forward plan.

Guanghua County has more than 700,000 mu of cultivated land, but the soil is thin and the water conservancy conditions are very poor, making it a well-known low-yield area in Hubei Province. However, in 1958, under the leadership of party organizations at all levels, the people of the county resolutely implemented the general line of socialist construction and vigorously built water conservancy projects and reformed farming techniques and production tools. Tremendous changes have taken place in the county's agricultural production, and the total output and average yield per mu of grain crops have both increased by more than double that of 1957, which was a relatively large harvest year. The total output and average yield per mu of cotton and oil crops also increased by two times and about one time respectively compared with 1957. Guanghua County has historically been a grain-deficient county. After the great leap forward last year, it not only removed the "low-yield area" label, but also became a surplus-grain county.

This great victory has brought confidence and strength to the people of the county to continue to leap forward. Based on this situation, the county party committee recently formulated a leap forward plan for the entire county. According to the plan put forward by the county party committee, the average yield per mu targets for several major crops in the county this year are: strive for 1,000 jin of wheat; 2,000 jin of rice, striving for 2,500 jin; 800 jin of miscellaneous grains, striving for 1,000 jin; 250 jin of cotton (lint), striving for 1,000 jin (seed cotton); 300 jin of sesame, striving for 350 jin. Even if these average yield per mu targets are calculated based on guaranteed figures, they are more than doubled to one and a half times higher than the actual output last year. In addition, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries will also increase production by more than double last year, with the exception of individual projects.

In order to realize the annual leap forward plan, the county party committee put forward seven major measures on the basis of summarizing last year's experience: 1. Seriously implement the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the party and the spirit of the Provincial Party Congress, vigorously grasp party rectification and commune rectification, further break down superstitions, emancipate the mind, go all out, aim high, and organize an even greater production upsurge. 2. Carry out a mass debate, mobilize the masses to summarize and promote last year's successful experience, implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture more deeply and meticulously, and hold the red flag of technological revolution even higher. 3. Strengthen wheat field management work centered on accumulating fertilizer, manufacturing fertilizer, and topdressing, and strive to achieve a wheat yield of 1,000 jin per mu to fire the first shot of the leap forward. 4. Make early preparations for the completion of water conservancy projects and vigorously do a good job in water storage and water conservation. 5. Vigorously grasp tool reform to further resolve the contradiction of insufficient labor. 6. Grasp all spring plowing preparation work, especially to grasp fertilizer accumulation, fertilizer manufacturing, and deep plowing, to lay a good foundation for spring sowing. 7. Carry out socialist labor emulation, and continuously spread advanced experience and promote the production movement to develop wave after wave through competition.

After the above plans and measures were submitted to the people's communes for discussion, the vast number of cadres and the masses unanimously agreed that they were advanced and feasible. Therefore, the people's communes immediately formulated corresponding plans and measures and quickly set off a new production upsurge. As of now, although a large number of laborers in the county have been participating in the Danjiangkou water conservancy project and railway construction, various summer harvest crops have generally been topdressed and weeded three times. The county's water conservancy project is also progressing rapidly. Calculated by earthwork, it has cumulatively completed more than 60% of the planned tasks for the winter and spring. At the same time, the people's communes have also organized forces to strengthen spring sowing preparations. They have now successively deep-plowed all the winter fallow land (fields) and are carrying out large-scale work such as accumulating fertilizer for spring-sown crops and repairing, matching, and adding spring plowing farm tools.

Because Guanghua County's entire winter production has been carried out vigorously and has created many successful experiences, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and the Xiangyang Prefectural Party Committee have issued the call to "Learn from Guanghua and Catch up with Guanghua" to the entire province and prefecture. Currently, the "Learn from Guanghua and Catch up with Guanghua" movement is unfolding throughout the province, and many of Guanghua County's experiences have begun to blossom and bear fruit in various places.

This Dispatch from Wuhan, February 27th: The vast number of cadres and the masses of Guanghua County, Hubei Province are actively working with soaring enthusiasm to realize the task of "wheat thousand-jin county" and "one season to get the whole year’s [harvest]".

Since last autumn, the people's communes of Guanghua County have been actively carrying out various preparations for planting summer harvest crops. The county has a total of 540,000 mu of summer harvest crops, of which 360,000 mu are wheat, all of which have been deep-plowed to about one foot; and 180,000 mu are broad beans and peas, which have also been deep-plowed to eight inches. The amount of base fertilizer applied to both wheat and bean crops is very sufficient, with wheat receiving about 1,000 dan of base fertilizer per mu, which is seven to eight times more than last year. As of now, all wheat and bean crops have generally been topdressed and weeded three times, and some have been topdressed and weeded four times. Among them, wheat has been topdressed an average of 300 dan to 400 dan per mu, an increase of more than two times compared with the same period last year; bean crops have been topdressed more than 100 dan per mu, an increase of nearly two times compared with the same period last year. Therefore, this year's summer harvest crops are growing very well. In terms of dense planting, at this time last year, wheat generally had only more than 100,000 plants per mu, and more than 200,000 plants were only found in individual high-yield fields; this year, up to now, each mu generally has about 600,000 plants, and some have reached 800,000 to 900,000 plants or even 1 million plants. The masses generally report that this year's wheat has no missing seedlings in any mu, and every plot is full of strong seedlings.

Over the past few months, the vast number of cadres and the masses of Guanghua County have fought against various difficulties in every possible way to ensure a bumper harvest of summer crops and realize the task of "wheat thousand-jin county" and "one season to get the whole year’s [harvest]". In order to ensure that crops have enough fertilizer, they used methods such as organizing surveys and holding forums with old farmers to vigorously open up fertilizer sources, and also sent people to other counties to learn the experience of making soil fertilizer many times. During the concentrated fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production, they worked day and night in several shifts. In order to regularize field management, the people's communes have established a responsibility system with dedicated personnel in charge of each field, so that every plot of land is cared for, and labor emulation focusing on strengthening field management is widely carried out. In order to solve the difficulties of insufficient labor, the people's communes have vigorously carried out tool reforms, centered on their own machinery manufacturing and repair networks, to improve labor efficiency. For example, in deep plowing, the county has successively reformed and promoted more than 40,000 rope-pulled plows and deep plows; in weeding and loosening the soil, it has created and promoted more than 30,000 pieces of manual and animal-powered nail rakes and weeding tools.

Now, the vast number of cadres and the masses of Guanghua County are advancing victoriously with soaring enthusiasm. The people's communes have launched the fourth concentrated movement of fertilizer accumulation, fertilizer production, and topdressing after the Spring Festival, and continue to vigorously strengthen field management.

    大跃进带来冲天干劲
    光化增产浪潮一年高一年
    群众正加强夏田管理保证小麦亩产千斤
    本报武汉27日电　去年农业生产上大放异彩的湖北省光化县，最近订出了今年农业生产更大跃进的计划。按照这个计划，今年全县各项农产品的总产量、平均单产量和农、副业总产值，都将在去年的基础上成倍地增长。计划实现后，全县按人口平均将达到这样的水平：粮食三千斤、籽棉一千斤、油料一百斤、鱼一百斤、菜一千斤、猪一头半，折合现金一千元。全县人民正以冲天的干劲，为实现跃进计划进行着不懈的斗争。
    光化县有耕地七十多万亩，但土质薄瘦，水利条件很差，是湖北省有名的低产地区。可是1958年全县人民在各级党组织的领导下坚决地贯彻执行了社会主义建设总路线，大力兴修了水利和改革了耕作技术、生产工具，全县的农业生产发生了极其巨大的变化，粮食作物的总产量和平均单产量，都较大丰收的1957年又猛增达一倍还多。棉花和油料作物的总产量和平均亩产量，也分别比1957年提高了两倍和一倍左右。光化县在历史上一直是缺粮县，经过去年的大跃进，不仅摘去了“低产区”的帽子，而且成了余粮县。
    这个伟大的胜利给全县人民带来了继续向前跃进的信心和力量。根据这个情况，县委在最近制定了全县的跃进计划。按照县委提出的计划，今年全县的几种主要作物的平均单产指标是：小麦力争千斤；水稻二千斤，争取二千五百斤；杂食八百斤，争取一千斤；棉花二百五十斤（皮棉），争取一千斤（籽棉）；芝麻三百斤，争取三百五十斤。这些作物的平均单产指标，即使是以保证数字计算，也分别比去年的实际产量提高了一倍到一倍半以上。此外，林、牧、副、渔各业，除个别项目外，也将比去年增产一倍以上。
    为了实现全年的跃进计划，县委在总结去年经验的基础上提出了七大措施：一、认真贯彻党的八届六中全会决议和省党代表会议的精神，大抓整党、整社工作，进一步破除迷信，解放思想，鼓足干劲，力争上游，组织更大的生产高潮。二、开展全民性的大辩论，发动群众总结和推广去年的成功经验，更深入、细致地贯彻农业的“八字宪法”，把技术革命的红旗举得更高。三、加强以积肥、造肥、追肥为中心的麦田管理工作，力争实现小麦亩产一千斤，打响跃进第一炮。四、提早做好水利工程结束工作，大力作好蓄水保水工作。五、大抓工具改革，进一步解决劳力不足的矛盾。六、把各项春耕准备工作抓好，特别是要抓好积肥、造肥和深翻地，为春播打好基础。七、开展社会主义劳动竞赛，通过竞赛不断地传播先进经验，推动生产运动一浪赶一浪地向前发展。
    上述计划和措施交各人民公社讨论后，广大干部和群众一致认为它们是先进而又可行的。因此，各人民公社都立即制订出了相应的规划和措施，并且迅速地掀起了新的生产高潮。截至目前为止，尽管全县一直有大批的劳动力参加丹江水利工程和铁路建设，但各种夏收作物却普遍追肥、锄草各三次。全县水利工程进展得也很快，按土方计算，累计已完成去冬今春计划任务的60％以上。与此同时，各人民公社还组织力量加强了春播准备工作，现在已经先后深翻完了全部冬闲地（田），为春播作物积肥和修配、添制春耕农具等工作，也在大规模地进行。
    由于光化县整个冬季生产搞得有声有色，创造出了不少成功的经验，中共湖北省委和襄阳地委都曾向全省和全专区发出了“学光化、赶光化”的号召。目前“学光化、赶光化”的运动正在全省展开，光化县的许多经验已开始在各地开花结果。
    本报武汉27日电　湖北省光化县的广大干部和群众正以冲天的干劲，为实现“小麦千斤县”和“一季捞全年”的任务积极劳动。
    光化县各人民公社从去年秋天起就积极地进行了种植夏收作物的各项准备工作。全县夏收作物共五十四万亩，其中小麦三十六万亩，全部深翻到一尺左右；蚕豆、豌豆十八万亩，也深翻到八寸左右。无论是小麦或豆类作物，底肥施用量都很充足，其中小麦每亩施底肥达到了一千担左右，比去年增加了七倍到八倍以上。截至目前为止，全部麦子和豆类作物已普遍追肥、锄草三次，有的已追肥、锄草四次。其中小麦每亩平均已追肥三百担到四百担，比去年同期的追肥量增加达二倍以上；豆类作物每亩已追肥百担以上，较去年同期增加了近两倍。因此，今年的夏收作物长得很好。在密植方面，去年在这个时候，小麦每亩一般只有十多万株，二十万株以上的只是个别的丰产田；今年到目前止，每亩一般都有苗六十万株左右，有一部分达到八、九十万株甚至一百万株。群众普遍反映说：今年的小麦是亩亩无缺苗，块块苗肥壮。
    光化县广大干部和群众几个月来为了确保夏收作物大丰收，实现“小麦千斤县”和“一季捞全年”的任务，曾经千方百计地向各种困难作过斗争。为了让作物有足够的肥料，他们用组织查勘和召开老农座谈会等办法，大力开辟肥源，还多次地派人到外县学习造土化肥的经验。在突击积肥、造肥的时候，分作几班人马，夜以继日地干。为了使田间管理经常化，各人民公社都建立了专人专管的责任制，使块块地都有人关心，并且广泛地开展了以加强田间管理为主要内容的劳动竞赛。为了解决劳动力不足的困难，各人民公社都以自己的机械制造修配网为中心，大力地进行了工具改革，提高劳动效率。如在深翻土地时，全县就先后改制和推广了四万多部绳索牵引犁和深耕犁；在锄草、松土时，又创制和推广三万多件人力、畜力的钉扒、锄草器等。
    现在，光化县的广大干部和群众，正以冲天的干劲乘胜猛进。各人民公社在春节后已掀起了第四次突击积肥、造肥、追肥的运动，并继续大力加强田间管理。（附图片）
