    Arrange Labor Education Appropriately According to Students' Age and Physical Strength: Chongqing Organizes Primary School Students as Little Helpers in Factories and Communes
    (Our Newspaper Reporter Li Sufen) Chongqing: More than 600 primary schools in Chongqing have widely organized primary school students to serve as little helpers in factories and people's communes, and to run their own small factories and small farms, so that children can participate in interesting labor within their capabilities, and receive labor education.
    In November last year, primary schools in Chongqing generally established ties with factories and people's communes, and set up more than 6,000 small factories. These small factories arrange labor education according to the age and physical strength of primary school students in urban and rural areas. Senior grade students work four hours per week, divided into two sessions; middle grade students work two hours per week; lower grade students are young, and they are guided to gradually learn to manage their daily life and learn to make some small handicrafts. Some schools in urban and industrial and mining areas have established processing plants in conjunction with factories, and organize senior grade students around the age of twelve to participate in some light labor. The labor production of these processing plants is closely related to natural science classes, including chemical engineering, electrical engineering, and metalworking. There are also telecommunications factories, ink factories, and alkali factories that manufacture simple telephones. In rural schools, children are generally organized as "little helpers" to help production teams accumulate fertilizer, weed, and catch insects. Some children make granular fertilizer, and many primary school students also run their own high-yield experimental gardens, doing some interesting experimental work. Many middle grade children in schools usually like to make small toys with paper, cloth scraps, and clay. The schools help them set up small factories, such as toy factories, recycled cotton weaving factories, straw hat factories, straw sandal factories, cardboard box factories, chalk factories, and raise small poultry such as rabbits and chickens. Primary school students often send batches of toys, straw hats, straw sandals, etc. to the peasant uncles of the people's communes and the younger brothers and sisters in nurseries and kindergartens.
    When implementing the Party's education policy, many primary schools in Chongqing have clearly stated that the purpose of primary school students participating in labor is to cultivate children's labor habits from an early age, promote physical and mental development, and learn some production knowledge and skills. All schools have formally included labor in the teaching plan, and many teachers also work with the students, explaining the significance of participating in productive labor to the students, and helping them summarize the gains of labor. In the process of labor, teachers also provide students with some production knowledge education. After the Zhonghua Road Primary School organized students to participate in labor, 25 of the 26 classes in the school became excellent collectives, and more than 90% of the students had excellent grades in Chinese and arithmetic. The students' organizational discipline was strengthened, and the students were more united. The children of this school boldly innovated operating techniques in labor and improved production efficiency. When processing cardboard boxes for an auto parts factory, the children in the cardboard factory made several wooden boards according to the size and shape of the cardboard boxes, reformed the operating techniques, and greatly improved the quality of the cardboard boxes. The primary school students who participated in labor in the printing factory changed the hand-cranked labor to foot-pedal operation, and changed single-sided printing to double-sided printing, which doubled the printing efficiency, so they became more interested in labor.
    In order to better implement the Party's education policy, Chongqing's primary schools are currently organizing teachers to further study the central government's instructions on education work, and at the same time focusing on rectifying the labor bases.

    按照学生年龄体力
    妥善安排劳动教育
    重庆组织小学生作工厂公社小助手
    本报讯　记者黎素芬报道：重庆市六百多所小学校广泛组织小学生作工厂、人民公社的小助手和自办小工厂、小农场，使儿童参加力所能及的有兴趣的劳动，并对他们进行劳动教育。
    去年11月，重庆市各小学校普遍和工厂、人民公社挂钩，办起了六千多个小工厂。这些小工厂按照城乡小学生的年龄、体力等情况，来安排劳动教育。高年级学生每周劳动四小时，分作两次进行，中年级学生每周劳动两小时，低年级学生年龄小，启发他们逐步学会管理自己的日常生活和学习做一些小手工艺品。城区和工矿区的一些学校同工厂挂钩，设立了加工厂，组织十二岁左右的高年级学生到加工厂参加一些轻便的劳动。这些加工厂的劳动生产大都同自然课有较密切的联系，包括化工、电工、金工，也有制作简单电话机的电讯厂、墨水厂和白碱厂。在农村的学校，一般是组织儿童作“小助手”，帮助生产队积肥、拔草、捉虫，有些儿童制造颗粒肥料，不少小学生还自己搞高产试验园地，做一些有趣的试验工作。许多学校的中年级儿童，平常喜欢用纸、布片、泥团等做小玩艺，学校就帮助他们办小工厂，如玩具厂、再生棉织厂、草帽厂、草鞋厂、纸盒厂、粉笔厂，以及饲养小兔、小鸡等小家禽。小学生们常常把一批批玩具、草帽、草鞋等送给人民公社的农民叔叔和托儿所、幼儿园的弟弟妹妹们。
    重庆市许多小学校在贯彻党的教育方针时，明确提出小学生参加劳动的目的是使儿童自幼养成劳动习惯，促进身心发育，并且学到一些生产知识和技能。各学校都把劳动正式列入教学计划，许多教师还和学生们一同劳动，对学生讲解参加生产劳动的意义，并且帮助他们总结劳动的收获。在劳动过程中，教师还对学生进行一些生产知识教育。中华路小学组织学生参加劳动以后，全校二十六个班有二十五个班成了优秀集体，语文、算术考试成绩优良的学生占90％以上，学生们的组织性纪律性加强了，学生之间也更加团结了。这个学校的儿童们在劳动中大胆革新操作技术，提高了生产效率。纸板厂的儿童们在给一个汽车配件厂加工纸盒时，依照纸盒模样大小做了几块木板，改革操作技术，大大提高了纸盒的质量。在印刷厂参加劳动的小学生们，把手摇劳动改为脚踏，改单面印刷为双面印刷，使印刷效率提高一倍，因此他们对劳动的兴趣更大了。
    为了更好地贯彻党的教育方针，最近重庆各小学校正组织教师进一步学习中央关于教育工作的指示，同时着重整顿劳动基地。
