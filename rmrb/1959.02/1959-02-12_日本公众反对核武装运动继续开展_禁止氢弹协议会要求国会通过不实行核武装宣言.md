Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch from Tokyo: The representatives of the Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs visited representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party in the Diet on the 10th, respectively, and presented them with a written request, demanding that the Diet immediately pass a declaration that Japan will not implement nuclear armament.

The request stated that the declaration of Japan not implementing nuclear armament must require that not only now but also in the future Japan will never engage in nuclear armament and will not allow nuclear weapons to be transported into Japanese territory.

The request pointed out that Japan's declaration of not implementing nuclear armament will not only enable Japan to get rid of the threat of nuclear weapons, but will also be the first step in saving the world from the crisis of atomic warfare.

The request pointed out that Japan's declaration of not implementing nuclear armament will become a model for all countries in the world both politically and morally, and at the same time is in line with the wishes of the peace-loving Japanese people.

In response to this request from the Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the representatives of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party both expressed their complete agreement and stated that they would work hard to enable the Diet to pass a declaration that Japan will not implement nuclear armament. However, Takeo Fukuda, Secretary-General of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, refused to accept this request, saying that the Liberal Democratic Party wanted to express its "own views," and that in the current world situation, the Liberal Democratic Party would not make a resolution like the "proposal to establish a zone of peace in the Far East" as called for by China and the Soviet Union to Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch from Tokyo: The Committee on Diet Policy of the Japanese Socialist Party decided today that Socialist Party members will not participate in the plenary sessions of the House of Representatives and the deliberations of all committees of the House of Representatives, expressing opposition to the Nobusuke Kishi group's two-faced tactics on the issue of nuclear armament.

When Nobusuke Kishi answered questions from Socialist Party members in the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives on the 9th, he said that he would not equip the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" with any nuclear weapons, and he pretended to agree with the Socialist Party to jointly submit a resolution to the Diet declaring that Japan would not implement nuclear armament. However, on the other hand, he instructed the Liberal Democratic Party to create various difficulties for the joint proposal suggested by the Socialist Party, refusing to clearly stipulate in the joint proposal that any kind of nuclear weapon is prohibited, wanting to revise the joint proposal into something that exists in name only, and wanting to delay the submission of the joint proposal by "separating" the Diet deliberation work from the joint proposal issue.

The Nobusuke Kishi group's two-faced tactics have been exposed. Mitsu Kono, Chairman of the Diet Policy Committee of the Socialist Party, pointed out when his meeting with Koshichi Masuda, Chairman of the Diet Policy Committee of the Liberal Democratic Party, broke down today, "This is a fundamental issue related to parliamentary politics. Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi must do as he said in the Diet. If this cannot be achieved, he must bear the responsibility." The Socialist Party stated that if the Liberal Democratic Party does not accept the Socialist Party's demands, the Socialist Party will not participate in Diet deliberation work starting from the 11th.

The Socialist Party issued a statement on this matter today, pointing out that Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, who is also the President of the Liberal Democratic Party, made a speech in the Diet about Japan not engaging in nuclear armament, but it was "rejected" by the ruling party itself, and his responsibility is significant. "This not only destroys the urgent desire of the Japanese people to oppose nuclear armament, but also undermines the parliamentary cabinet system."

Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch from Tokyo: A "National Rally Demanding the Expansion of Social Insurance" was held in Tokyo yesterday. The rally unanimously passed a resolution condemning the reactionary policies of the Nobusuke Kishi government.

    日本公众反对核武装运动继续开展
    禁止氢弹协议会要求国会通过不实行核武装宣言
    社会党反对岸信介两面手法决定不参加众议院审议工作
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会代表10日到国会分别访问自由民主党、社会党和共产党的代表，向他们提出要求书，要求在国会立即通过日本不实行核武装的宣言。
    要求书说，日本不实行核武装宣言必须要求不仅现在而且今后日本也永远不进行核武装和不许把核武器运进日本境内。
    要求书指出，日本宣布不实行核武装，不仅能使日本摆脱核武器的威胁，并且将成为拯救世界原子战争危机的第一步。
    要求书指出，日本不实行核武装宣言无论在政治上或者是道义上，都将成为世界各国的榜样，同时是符合爱好和平的日本人民的愿望的。
    对于日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会的这种要求，社会党和共产党的代表都表示完全同意，并且表示将为使国会通过日本不实行核武装宣言而努力。但是执政的自由民主党干事长福田赳夫竟拒绝接受这个要求，他说，自由民主党要表明“独自的见解”，在目前世界形势之下，自由民主党不做出如同中苏两国向日本发出的呼吁那样的“在远东建立和平地区的建议”的决议。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本社会党国会对策委员会今天决定，社会党议员将不参加众议院全体会议和所有众议院各委员会的审议工作，表示反对岸信介集团在核武装问题上耍弄两面手法。
    岸信介9日在众议院预算委员会回答社会党议员的质询时表示，将不用任何核武器装备日本“自卫队”，他摆出一副同意同社会党向国会联合提出宣布日本不实行核武装决议案的姿态。但是，另一方面，他又指使自由民主党对社会党建议的这个联合提案多方留难，拒绝在联合提案中明确规定禁止任何种类的核武器，要把这个联合提案修改成为一个有名无实的东西，并且想用把国会审议工作同这个联合提案问题“分开来进行”的办法，拖延联合提案的提出。
    岸信介集团的两面手法已经被揭穿。社会党国会对策委员会委员长河野密今天在同自由民主党国会对策委员会委员长增田甲子七会谈决裂时指出，“这是同议会政治有根本关联的问题，要岸信介首相按照他在国会上所作的发言去做，如果不能实现，就要承担责任”。社会党表示，如果自由民主党不接受社会党的要求，社会党从11日起就不参加国会审议工作。
    社会党今天就这件事发表声明指出，身为自由民主党总裁的岸信介首相在国会上发表的关于日本不进行核武装的讲话，竟被执政党自己“否定”，他的责任是重大的。“这不仅是摧残了日本国民反对核武装的迫切愿望，而且也破坏了议会内阁制度。”
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：东京昨天举行了“要求扩充社会保险国民大会”，大会一致通过决议，谴责岸信介政府的反动政策。
