Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 23rd: The entire workforce of the Guangzhou Paper Mill, a large newsprint factory, recently held a meeting and passed eight competition conditions, initiating a socialist competition with seventeen other paper mills to ensure an even greater paper production increase this year.

The seventeen paper mills are: Jilin Paper Mill, Shiyan Paper Mill, and Kaishantun Paper Mill in Jilin Province; Lihua Paper Mill and China Paperboard Mill under the Shanghai Paper Company; Tianjin Paper General Factory; Jiamusi Paper Mill in Heilongjiang Province; Shandong Paper Mill; JinCheng Paper Mill and Yingkou Paper Mill in Liaoning Province; 601 Paper Mill, 602 Paper Mill, and Zhongyuan Paper Mill in Sichuan Province; Nanchang Paper Mill in Jiangxi; Nanping Paper Mill in Fujian; Jiaxing Minfeng Paper Mill and Hangzhou Huafeng Paper Mill in Zhejiang Province.

The Guangzhou Paper Mill employees' own proposed goals are: to guarantee exceeding the state-specified paper production plan by 25% this year (an increase of 52.5% over last year); and to exceed the state-specified output value plan by 35.47% (an increase of 45.63% over last year). They proposed the following eight specific competition conditions:

One, the wire section paper machine's production rate (newsprint, calculated as an annual average): No. 2 paper machine to reach 99% (i.e., waste paper lost during the paper machine operation does not exceed 1%); high-speed paper machine to reach 95%.

Two, the paper's finished product rate (calculated as an annual average): No. 1 and No. 2 paper machines to reach 94.08%; high-speed paper machine to reach 88.36%.

Three, conserve raw materials. While vigorously saving chemical raw materials, all wood bark, sawdust, knots, raw wood chips, coarse residue, etc., lost in the past processing should be recovered and used for papermaking.

Four, extend the service life of valuable items. The amount of copper mesh consumed per ton of paper should be reduced by 30% compared to last year.

Five, the amount of pulp consumed per ton of paper should reach the national advanced level.

Six, increase labor productivity, guaranteeing an 11% increase compared to last year.

Seven, guarantee safe production.

Eight, develop comprehensive utilization, striving to utilize all waste materials to manufacture new products.

While formulating the competition plan, the Guangzhou Paper Mill also formulated many specific measures to achieve this plan. Currently, all the factory employees are enthusiastically engaged in a large-scale technical revolution, working hard to achieve the competition conditions they have proposed. (Attached picture)

    新华社广州23日电　规模很大的新闻造纸厂——广州造纸厂的全体职工最近举行大会通过八项竞赛条件，倡议同十七个造纸厂开展社会主义竞赛，保证今年造纸工业更大丰产。
    这十七个造纸厂是：吉林省的吉林造纸厂，石砚造纸厂，开山屯造纸厂；上海造纸公司所属的利华造纸厂，中国纸板厂；天津造纸总厂；黑龙江省的佳木斯造纸厂；山东造纸厂；辽宁省的金城造纸厂，营口造纸厂；四川省六○一造纸厂；六○二造纸厂，中原造纸厂；江西南昌造纸厂；福建南平造纸厂；浙江省嘉兴民丰造纸厂，杭州华丰造纸厂。
    广州造纸厂职工自己提出的奋斗目标是：保证今年超额25％完成国家规定的纸张产量计划（比去年增长52.5％）；超额35.47％完成国家规定的产值计划（比去年增长45.63％），他们提出的八项具体竞赛条件如下：
    一，长网抄纸机的抄造率（新闻纸，以全年平均计算）：二号抄纸机达到99％（即抄纸机在操作过程中损失的废纸不超过1％）；高速抄纸机达到95％。
    二，纸张的成品率（全年平均计算）：第一、二号抄纸机达到94.08％；高速抄纸机达到88.36％。
    三，节约原材料。在大力节约化工原材料的同时，要把过去加工过程中损失的木皮、木糠、木节、生木片、粗渣等，全部回收用来抄纸。
    四，延长贵重品的使用寿命。每吨纸消耗的铜网，要比去年降低30％。
    五，每吨纸消耗的纸浆量，要达到全国先进水平。
    六，提高劳动生产率，保证比去年提高11％。
    七，保证做到安全生产。
    八，发展综合利用，争取把一切废料都利用起来，制造新产品。
    广州造纸厂在拟订竞赛计划的同时；还制订了实现这个计划的许多具体措施。目前，全厂职工正在热火朝天地大闹技术革命，为实现自己所提出的竞赛条件而努力。（附图片）
