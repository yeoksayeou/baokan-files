    A Casual Discussion on the National Form of Literature
　　Mao Dun

    When we talk about the national form of our country's literature and art, people first think of opera, music, dance, fine arts, and architecture, because in the formal aspects of these arts, the national style is obvious. People's opinions on the characteristics of the national form of these arts are generally consistent, although there are still different views on individual specific issues.
    When it comes to literature, the issue is more complicated. People feel that old-style poetry, old-style novels (from Song dynasty storytellers' scripts to chaptered novels), and the wide variety of storytelling literature all have their own national forms, but in new-style poetry, new-style novels, and other literary works that have become popular since the May Fourth Movement, the national form seems less obvious, and it even feels like there is no national form at all.
    This is a question worth discussing.
    Do our new-style novels and new-style poems have a national form? If not, or if only a little, how should we strive to create or develop it?
    Recently, many articles discussing the development of new poetry have revolved around the issue of the national form of poetry. Poets agree that developing new poetry on the basis of classical poetry and folk songs is the right direction. However, the issue of evaluating new folk songs and the question of whether regulated verse or free verse is the "mainstream" have also arisen. Regarding the former issue, after criticizing incorrect arguments, understanding is becoming more consistent. Generally speaking, new folk songs are both ideological and artistically valuable, although there are many imitations among them that are not very good. However, it is inevitable that some (or even most) of the hundreds of millions of new folk songs are not good, but this does not detract from the value of new folk songs themselves. As for the idea that the monotonous forms of new folk songs (four, six, or eight lines of five- or seven-character verses) are an "innate defect," this is also not a valid argument. This view is one-sided and does not look at the issue from a developmental perspective. In short, after debate, the problem of overestimation or underestimation of new folk songs has been corrected, and everyone agrees that we must learn from new folk songs.
    Regarding the latter issue, the question of whether regulated verse or free verse is the mainstream, I am not clear on how this question was initially raised. I think that since everyone now acknowledges that the correct direction for the development of new poetry is based on classical poetry and folk songs, then the question of which is the mainstream should not arise. The mainstream should be new poetry in a national form based on classical poetry and folk songs. However, this sentence should not be interpreted as rejecting the "Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy. If this sentence needs a footnote, it is that in the process of creating a new poetic style (the national form of new poetry), poets should strive to develop it on the basis of classical poetry and folk songs. The new poetic style should also be a "Hundred Flowers Bloom." Poetry creation in the last six months has already made a good start. If we are to evaluate the historical merits and demerits of new poetry (free verse), then I would argue that in the thirty years from the May Fourth Movement to before Liberation, in areas ruled by reactionary forces, the main form of poetry that played a progressive role at the time, that is, poetry that served as a cultural vanguard in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic movement, was free verse rather than regulated verse. Of course, the free verse I am referring to is the form used by progressive poets at that time: neither neat five- or seven-character lines, nor the "staircase style" that some people find headache-inducing, nor the "tofu-square style"; neither completely without rhyme and rhythm, nor necessarily rhyming at the end of every line. The so-called "free verse" written by a few so-called "poets" and appreciated by a small number of young people, which was difficult to read and understand (some say these bad poems can be called translation style, but I think they are even more difficult to read and understand than the most difficult translated poems, while good translated poems are not difficult to read and understand), although they themselves praised it highly, actually had no effect. As for those who studied folk songs and tried to use folk song forms, there was Pu Feng at that time, and we advocated for him when his collection of poems was published; however, it ultimately failed to become a trend, partly due to historical conditions, and partly because we did not emphasize at that time that the creation of the national form of new poetry should be based on folk songs. Summarizing past experience, we can have a deeper understanding of today's proposed direction of development based on classical poetry and folk songs (which is also the direction of completing the national form of new poetry). However, if we deny the historical role of new poetry in the past thirty years under the banner of this direction, I think it is not a realistic attitude.
    In the debate between regulated verse and free verse, some arguments lack a spirit of analysis. When regulated verse is mentioned, people think of the strictly regulated poetic forms after the Qi and Liang dynasties (later known as "near-style" poems), and they equate this poetic form with the entire classical poetry. In my opinion, in Chinese classical poetry, apart from these "near-style" regulated poems, the poems formerly called "ancient-style" poems can all be regarded as free verse. Compared with today's free verse, the only difference is the degree of freedom. Why do I say that the degree of freedom is different? This is in comparison to "near-style poems." "Ancient-style poems"—if you don't object to calling them free verse in classical poetry—have lines of varying lengths, looser restrictions on rhyme (many rhyme categories in modern rhymes are interchangeable in ancient-style poems), can change rhymes, and the tones of the words in symmetrical lines are not as strictly controlled as in "near-style" poems. Compared to "near-style poems," they are much "freer," although they are still less "free" than the free verse of new poetry after the May Fourth Movement. Li Bai's ancient-style poems can be regarded as representatives of the free school in classical poetry. Today's poets who write free verse can inherit and develop this tradition of classical poetry, so why hesitate when they hear about those strictly regulated "near-style" poems? I believe that today's free verse is already more free in syntax and structure than the "free verse" in classical poetry, which is progress and development. However, in terms of practicing character use, sentence structure, and rhythm, we should learn from the limited freedom of "classical free verse." We want both freedom and limited freedom. The former refers to structure, and the latter refers to the language of poetry (also known as "literary language").
    The national form of literature contains two factors: one is language (literary language; the term "literary language," in its broad sense, refers to the language used in philosophical, literary, scientific, political, and economic works; specifically referring to the language used in literary works, it has the name "artistic language," but usually when discussing literary form, the commonly used "literary language" refers to "artistic language" and not the broad sense of "literary language," which I will follow here.), which is the main and decisive factor; the other is the mode of expression (i.e., genre), which is secondary and only plays a supporting role. In poetry, regulated verse or free verse is a mode of expression. This or that mode of expression alone cannot determine its national form (because this or that mode of expression, we have it, and other nations can also have it; foreign poetry also has regulated verse and free verse; some of our new poems are influenced by foreign free verse, but as mentioned above, free verse is actually inherent in our culture), but must rely on the language of poetry. The so-called language of poetry, like general literary language, is processed and refined on the basis of the national language to make it more quintessential, more image-rich, and more rhythmically beautiful. Literary language cannot be unchanged spoken language, but it cannot be separated from the basic elements of spoken language—vocabulary, grammar, and rhetoric. Literary language, like spoken language, develops with changes in national life. In the process of development, some unsuitable vocabulary, grammar, and rhetoric are eliminated, and some new vocabulary, grammar, and rhetoric that are more suitable for the changing new life are added. However, in order to adapt to the particularities of poetry, the language of poetry can be processed more than the literary language of prose works (novels, dramas, etc.), or in other words, it can be at a greater distance from the basic elements of spoken language. But it cannot violate the basic laws of vocabulary, grammar, and rhetoric of spoken language. If it does, we have a polite criticism: "affected." To give a ready-made example, Du Fu's two lines of poetry: "Parrots peck at fragrant rice kernels that are left, old phoenixes perch on green wutong branches," really violate the basic laws of spoken language. Although it is Du Fu's poetry, we cannot be too superstitious and think that such poetic language should also be learned. There are many such lines in classical poetry, and none of them can be learned.
    Someone translated Chairman Mao's *Qinyuanchun: Snow* into spoken language, in which the line "Clad in silver and draped in red" was translated as: "It looks like a person with white clothes setting off red makeup" (see "Literary Knowledge" 1958, Issue 3, page 11). Adding some explanation to help readers appreciate "Ode to Snow" is appropriate, but I doubt whether it should be translated into spoken language. But after reading the spoken language translation of "Clad in silver and draped in red," I felt that it should be called "restoration" rather than "translation." Why? Because the original is the language of poetry, while the translation is not. The translation of poetry should also be the language of poetry. According to this spoken language translation, it simply restores the language of poetry that the poet extracted and refined from the spoken language to spoken language. Not only the line "Clad in silver and draped in red" is like this, but all the other translated sentences in the entire poem can be said to be "restored" to spoken language, rather than translated into poetic language that is closer to spoken language than the original. This cannot be entirely attributed to the translator's poor skills. It is really because he does not understand that 99 percent of the sentences in this *Qinyuanchun: Snow* cannot be translated into more colloquial language while still being the language of poetry. The sentences of the original poem are all extracted and processed from spoken language. They are both beautiful and magnificent (beautiful and magnificent in image and beautiful and magnificent in rhythm). If you want to make these words and sentences more colloquial, then it will inevitably only be restored to spoken language; try reading the translation in the third issue of "Literary Knowledge," how awkward and deflating. I have the same feeling after reading the translation of another *Qinyuanchun: Changsha* in the same issue.
    I give this example to illustrate that the language of poetry cannot be the original style of spoken language; all literary language is processed spoken language. This point is just as important as the fact that the language of poetry allows for a greater distance from the basic laws of spoken language (compared to the literary language in prose works), but it cannot violate the basic laws of spoken language. Without understanding this principle, one cannot correctly grasp the direction of development based on classical poetry and folk songs. In other words, one will not be able to achieve the creation of the national form of new poetry well.
    Precisely because the main factor in the national form of literary works is literary language processed on the basis of the national language, when the literary works of any nation are translated into other languages, they will inevitably lose their national style to a greater or lesser extent. When two relatively close languages are mutually translated, more of it can be preserved, but translating poetry is more difficult than translating prose.
    There is another way of talking about national form. This view also acknowledges that language is the first and foremost factor in national form, but at the same time, it also regards the national life content expressed in the works (local color, customs, national thoughts and feelings—the nationality of the characters' personalities, etc.) as an important factor in national form. This view, starting from the national form as "a form permeated with national content," concludes that the national form is broad and includes national language and national life content. This saying seems to have sufficient reasons. No one will admit that a work that only uses the national language but cannot express the national life content (local color, customs, national thoughts and feelings) can be considered to have a national form. For example, if there is such a work, written in Chinese about Chinese life, but the customs are not Chinese or from a certain part of China, and the characters' voices, smiles, thoughts, and feelings are all foreign; we would of course be extremely dissatisfied with such a work. Because first and foremost, it is not like Chinese people, not like Chinese life. Likeness is a serious issue of content. We oppose works that are not like Chinese people and Chinese life, not from the perspective of national form, but from the perspective of their content's lack of authenticity. On the other hand, works that do not raise the issue of whether the content is authentic may also raise the question of whether they have a national form. For example, the text of some of our works is in the so-called translation style, which is not what the common people like to see and hear. Of course, we cannot imagine a national form without national life content. We oppose opposing content and form (as formalists do), but we cannot apply the principle of unifying content and form as a formula to the issue of national form; national life content in works is ultimately mainly a content issue. Using the national language to express this content is what gives the work a national form. Returning the authentic reflection of national life content to its original position in the content of literary works does not diminish the importance of national life content in works of national form; on the contrary, it emphasizes and highlights its importance. If we follow the broad definition, although it seems on the surface that we never forget the unity of form and content, in essence, we are reducing content to the category of form, which is contrary to the principle that content determines form. We firmly oppose formalism taking advantage of loopholes, and we want to seriously criticize those so-called national form works that are clothed in the guise of the national language but have little or no national life content. However, we cannot confuse the content and form of works just because we are afraid of formalism taking advantage of loopholes. Moreover, we cannot but consider the possibility that a work may be qualified in expressing national life content, but there are problems in using the national language, such as not conforming to the standardization of language and not being liked by the people. If we follow the broad definition that national life content is a component factor of the national form of a work that occupies half of its composition, then can such a work be considered to have half of the national form? This only complicates the issue.
    This is all I will say about the relationship between national life content and national form. This passage is not idle talk, because, on the issue of the national form of novels, it is inevitable that the issue of national life content will be involved, and it is also in the area of novels that misunderstandings often arise, and the reflection of national life content is regarded as the expression of national form.
    Next, I plan to briefly talk about the issue of the national form of our novels. I think it is not necessary to spend any more time solemnly pointing out that novels of national form must have sufficient and authentic national life content. I have said enough about it above. Here, I will only talk about it from the perspective of form.
    Regarding the national form of novels, there are usually the following views:
    It is believed that the chaptered style is the national form of our long novels, and the notebook style (this term is used in the old sense, referring to the notebook novels collected in "Taiping Guangji" up to those of the Qing Dynasty) is the national form of our short novels; it is believed that stories with a beginning and an end, unfolding in sequence, are a national form, while starting in the middle without following the sequence is a foreign form. These views are quite common.
    I think these views are all worth studying. We can admit that the chaptered style, the notebook style, the order of stories, etc., are all forms created in the long-term development process of our country's novels, and are what the common people like to see and hear; however, we must also say that these forms only occupy a technical position in the national form, and technical things are universal and cannot be used as the sole symbol of the national form. For example, stories with a beginning and an end, unfolding in sequence, although it is a commonly used method in our classical novels, it is not unique to our country; starting in the middle without following the sequence, although it became very popular after the May Fourth Movement (it is also a fact that the writers at that time were a little influenced by foreign countries), but aren't the Song Dynasty storytellers' scripts "A Demon in West Mountain Cave" and the Yuan and Ming Dynasties' storytellers' scripts "The Story of Quick-tongued Li Cuilian" started in the middle? Although a large part of the novels in "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" start with "So-and-so, from such-and-such place…," which on the surface seems to be sequential and have a beginning and an end, but in essence, they only describe a certain encounter of so-and-so, isn't it also starting in the middle? As for the chaptered style, it may be unique to our country, but if we hold on to this point to represent the national form of our classical novels, then it would be a vulgarization of the issue of national form. This is not a correct evaluation of the national form of our classical novels, but is really lowering its true value and distorting its true meaning.
    If we must find the national form in the mode of expression of our classical novels, I think we should put aside the technical things that can be called genres, such as the chaptered style, the notebook style, having a beginning and an end, unfolding in sequence, etc., and look for them in the structure of the novel and the shaping of characters.
    The structure of our classical novels is not immutable, but has developed; if we take the May Fourth Movement as the dividing line, and all novels before the May Fourth Movement (such as the works of Li Boyuan and Wu Jianren, etc.) are counted in the scope of classical novels, then from the Song Dynasty storytellers' scripts (not to mention what was collected in "Taiping Guangji") to "A Flower in a Sinful Sea," the changes and development of its structure are clearly visible: from simple to complex, from planar to three-dimensional, from parallel to interlaced. Such a law of development is not unique to our country's novels, but in this development process, our long novels have completed the structure of national form. This can be summarized in twelve characters: separable and combinable, sparse and dense interspersed, seemingly broken but actually connected. If we use architecture as a metaphor, a long novel can be compared to a garden, and the buildings and courtyards in the garden each become independent and complete small units, each with its own pattern. This is like the chapters (episodes) of a long novel, each with its own focus, its own climax, and its own situation. The chapters, each with its own focus, are intertwined to form the waves of the entire novel, just as the pavilions, waterside buildings, lake and mountain stones, flowers and trees, etc., each with its own pattern and personality, form the entire garden's magnificent and elegant, broad and tortuous situation. I believe that our long classical novels rely on this structural method to achieve the following purposes: being as long as a million words but being able to unfold freely, and having large and small stories that are diverse and complex but arranged appropriately.
    This structural method is closely coordinated with the method of shaping characters. The national form is also clearly visible in the method of shaping characters.
    I think the national form of shaping characters can be summarized in the following sentence: the combination of rough-line outlining and detailed brushwork. The former is often used to depict the character's personality, that is, to make the character express his personality through a series of events, and this series of events is usually expressed in a concise and powerful narrative style (rough-line outlining), and rarely expressed in a lengthy and detailed lyrical style. The latter is often used to describe the character's voice and appearance, that is, to render the character's demeanor through dialogue and small actions.
    However, the mode of expression is, after all, an artistic skill, and artistic skills are universal; therefore, looking at the mode of expression independently cannot say that this must be the national form of the literature of nation A, and that must be the national form of the literature of nation B. It must be combined with another most important factor before the national form that the work has must be that of nation A and not that of nation B; this main factor is literary language that originates from the national language and has been processed. This factor is particularly prominent in the national form of poetry, and relatively less prominent in the national form of novels, but its importance cannot be ignored because it is not so prominent.
    The characteristics of structure and the characteristics of character shaping can often be retained in the same way when the work is translated into a foreign language; however, the flavor of the national language attached to literary language (precisely because literary language is refined national language, this flavor is particularly rich) is often difficult to fully express in other languages, and sometimes even partial expression is difficult to obtain.
    If we take Lu Xun's works as an example, this issue can be seen more clearly. Even the most formally close to foreign novels, Lu Xun's works still have their own national form. This is his literary language. It is also this national form that constitutes Lu Xun's personal style. It is precisely this personal style that is often lost in translation. On the surface, it seems that what is not well translated or cannot be translated is only personal style, but in essence, it is national form.
    Finally, to sum up, I believe that the main factor in the national form of literature is literary language, but we cannot ignore the mode of expression created by national literature in the long-term development process; at the same time, acknowledging the absolute importance of language factors in national form does not mean denying the possibility of translating national form literature into foreign languages. Not only can the national life content permeated in the form be completely retained in the translated version of the foreign translation, but even part of the artistic skills can be transferred; in this way, a good translated version can enable readers to understand the ideological content of the original work and also enable readers to appreciate the artistic form of the original work. What cannot be translated is only the unique flavor of the literary language of the original work. Perhaps some people are very dissatisfied with this and feel that the tenacious national language can be transformed into something more elastic or adaptable; but in this way, the theory of the national form of literature would have to be completely changed, which may be a matter of a hundred years from now, so I will not predict it.

    漫谈文学的民族形式
　　茅盾
    提起我国文学、艺术的民族形式，人们首先就要想到戏曲、音乐、舞蹈、美术和建筑，因为在这些艺术的形式部分，民族风格是显而易见的。对于这些艺术的民族形式的特征，人们的意见大体上也是一致的，虽然在个别具体问题上也还有不同的看法。
    谈到文学，问题就比较复杂了。人们会觉得旧体诗词、旧体小说（从宋人话本直到章回体小说）以及品种极多的说唱文学，都有各自的民族形式，可是在新体诗、新体小说等等“五四”以后兴行的文学作品上，民族形式就好像不大显著了，甚至还觉得简直没有民族形式。
    这是一个值得讨论的问题。
    我们的新体小说和新体诗究竟有没有民族形式？如果还没有，或者只有一点点，我们应当怎样努力来创造或发展？
    近来有不少文章讨论新诗的发展问题，就是围绕着诗歌的民族形式问题进行的。诗人们都认为，在古典诗歌和民歌的基础上发展新诗，这个方向是正确的。但是又发生了对新民歌估价的问题和格律诗与自由诗孰为“主流”的问题。对于前一问题，在批评了不正确的议论以后，认识是趋于一致了。新民歌总的说来，是思想性和艺术性都很高的，虽然新民歌中间也有不少模仿品并不高明，但数以亿计的新民歌有一部分（或者甚至大部分）不好的作品，也是难免的，无损于新民歌本身的价值。至于说新民歌形式单调（五、七言的四句、六句或八句），是新民歌“先天的缺陷”，也不是确论。这种看法是片面的，而且不从发展上看问题。总之，经过辩论以后，对新民歌估价的偏高偏低的毛病，得到了纠正，而且大家一致认为：必须向新民歌学习。
    对于后一问题，格律体和自由体孰为主流的问题，我还不明白这个问题最初是以什么方式提出来的。我想，既然现在大家都承认新诗发展的正确方向是以古典诗歌和民歌为基础，那就应当不发生格律体与自由体孰为主流的问题。主流应当是以古典诗歌和民歌为基础的民族形式的新诗歌。但是这句话不可以解释为排斥百花齐放。这句话如果需要注解，那就是：在创造新诗风（新诗的民族形式）的过程中，诗人们努力的方向是以古典诗歌和民歌为基础而加以发展。新诗风也应当是百花齐放，最近半年来的诗创作已经作了良好的开端。如果要论评新诗（自由体）的历史上的功罪，那我倒以为，从“五四”到解放前，这三十年间，在反动势力统治的地区，当时起着进步作用的，也就是说，在反帝、反封建的民主运动中作为文化战线上一个支队的诗歌的主要形式，是自由体而不是格律体。当然，这里说的自由体，指的是那时候的进步诗人们所使用的形式：既非整齐的五、七言，也不是有些人所头痛的“楼梯式”，同时也不是“豆腐干体”；既非全然没有韵节，也不是定要句尾押韵。那时候少数所谓“诗人”所写并为少数青年所欣赏的令人难以卒读的所谓“自由体”（有人说这些坏诗可称为翻译体，我看它们实在比最难读的翻译诗还难读难懂，而好的翻译诗并不难读难懂），虽然他们自己吹捧得很厉害，其实不起作用。至于学习民歌、试用民歌体者，当时曾有蒲风，我们在他的诗集出版的时候曾经鼓吹过；然而终于不能蔚为风气，一方面由于历史条件，又一方面由于我们在那时没有强调新诗的民族形式的创造应当以民歌为基础之一。总结过去的经验，能够对于今天所提出的以古典诗歌和民歌为基础的发展方向（也是完成新诗歌的民族形式的方向），体会得更深刻些。但是，如果在这方向的旗帜下否定三十年来新诗歌的历史作用，我以为不是实事求是的态度。
    在格律体和自由体的争论中，有些议论还欠缺分析的精神。一提到格律体，人们就会想到齐梁以后的格律森严的诗体（即后来称为近体的），并且把这种诗体和整个古典诗混为一谈。依我看来，中国古典诗中除了这些旧称为“近体”的格律诗而外，旧称为“古体”的诗，都可以算作自由体，和今天的自由体比起来，仅自由之程度大小不同而已。为什么说自由之程度大小不同呢？这是和“近体诗”比较说的。“古体诗”——如果你不反对称它为古典诗中的自由体——是有长短句的，押韵限制宽（今韵的不少韵部在古体诗是通用的），可以换韵，上下句对称的字的平仄不像“近体”扣得那么紧，等等，对“近体诗”说来，就“自由”得多了，虽然比“五四”以后新诗的自由体还少些“自由”。李白的古体诗可以算是古典诗中自由派的代表。今天写自由体的诗人大可以继承古典诗这个传统而发展之，何必一听到古典诗就想到那些格律森严的“近体”，从而迟疑却步？我以为：我们的今天的自由体在句法、章法上已经比古典诗中的“自由体”更自由些了，这是一个进步，一个发展，但对于练字、练句和韵律，等等，还应当学习“古典自由体”的有限制的自由。又要自由，又要限制自由，前者指结构，后者指诗的语言（亦即一般称为“文学语言”的）。
    文学的民族形式包含两个因素，一是语言（文学语言，按“文学语言”一词，就其广义而言，指哲学、文学、科学、政治、经济等著作所用的语言，专指文学作品所用的语言，有“艺术语言”一名，但是通常谈文学形式时常用的“文学语言”即指“艺术语言”而不指广义的“文学语言”，此从之。），这是主要的，起决定作用的。二是表现方式（即体裁），这是次要的，只起辅助作用。就诗而论，格律体或自由体是表现方式，光是这个或那个表现方式还不能决定它的民族形式（因为这个或那个的表现方式，我有之，别的民族也可有之，外国诗也有格律体和自由体，我们的有些新诗受外国自由诗的影响，但如上所述，自由体实亦我所固有），必有赖于诗的语言。所谓诗的语言，和一般的文学语言一样，是在民族语言的基础上加工提炼使其更精萃，更富于形象性、更富于节奏美。文学语言不能是原封不动的口语，但也不能脱离口语的基本要素——词汇、词法和修辞法。文学语言也和口语一样，是随着民族生活的变化而发展的。在发展的过程中，淘汰了一些不适用的词汇、词法和修辞法，增加了一些更适合于变化着的新生活的新词汇、词法和修辞法。然而为了适应诗的特殊性，诗的语言可以比散文作品（小说、话剧等）的文学语言更多些加工，或者说，可以和口语的基本要素有较大的距离。但不能违反口语的词汇、词法和修辞的基本规律。违反了，我们有一句客气的批语，曰“雕琢”。举一个现成的例，杜甫的两句诗：“香稻啄余鹦鹉粒，碧梧栖老凤凰枝”，实在是违反口语的基本规律的，虽然是杜诗，我们不能太迷信，以为这样的诗的语言也当学习。古典诗中这样的诗句很多，都是不可以学的。
    有人把毛主席的沁园春“雪”译为口语，其中“看红装素裹”一句是这样译的：“看起来恰象一个人儿白的衣裳衬托着红的妆点”（见“文学知识”1958年第三期第十一页）。为了帮助读者欣赏“咏雪”，加点解释是应当的，至于是不是应当译为口语，我很怀疑。可是我读了“看红装素裹”的口语译文以后，觉得这与其称为“译”，还不如称之为“还原”。为什么？因为原文是诗的语言，而译文则不是。诗的译文也应当是诗的语言。照这句口语译文看来，只是把诗人从口语加工提炼的诗的语言还原为口语。不但“看红装素裹”一句是这样，整首词的其他的译句，也都可以说是“还原”为口语，而不是翻译为比原词更近于口语的诗的语言。这倒也不能光归咎于译者的本领差，实在是由于他不了解这首沁园春“咏雪”的百分之九十九的句子不能翻译为比原句更口语化而同时又是诗的语言。原词的句子都是从口语提炼加工来的，又美丽、又雄壮（形象上的美丽、雄壮和节奏上的美丽、雄壮），如果你要把这些词句再口语化些，那就必然只是还原为口语而已；试读“文学知识”第三期那篇译文，多么别扭，多么泄气。读了同刊同期另一沁园春词“长沙”的译文，也有同感。
    我举这个例，意在说明，诗的语言不能就是原来样式的口语；所有文学语言都是加工了的口语。这一点，正和诗的语言虽然容许与口语的基本规律有较大的距离（对散文作品中的文学语言作的比较），但是不能违反口语的基本规律，是同样重要的。不了解这个道理，就不能正确地掌握以古典诗歌和民歌为基础的发展的方向。换言之，也就是不会很好地实现新诗的民族形式的创造。
    正因为文学作品的民族形式的主要因素是在民族语言基础上加工的文学语言，所以任何民族的文学作品翻译为其他语文的时候，或多或少总不免要丧失它的民族风格。比较接近的两种语言在互译时或者还能多保存一些，但译诗还是比译散文为难。
    对于民族形式，还有另一种说法。这一种说法也承认语言是民族形式的首先第一因素，但同时又把作品中所表现的民族生活内容（地方色彩、风俗习惯、民族思想情感——人物性格的民族性等等），也看作民族形式的重要因素。这一种说法，从民族形式即“渗透着民族内容的形式”出发，得出结论是：民族形式是广义的，它包含民族语言和民族生活内容。这一说，看来理由很充足。谁也不会承认，仅仅使用民族语言而不能表现民族生活内容（地方色彩、风俗习惯、民族思想情感）的作品，可以算它具有民族形式。比方说，如果有这么一部作品，用中国语言写中国生活，可是风俗习惯不是中国的或中国某一地的，人物的声音笑貌、思想情感都是洋气洋腔；对于这样一部作品，我们当然极不满意。因为首先第一它写的不像中国人，不像中国生活。像不像，是一个严重的内容问题。我们反对不像中国人和中国生活的作品，不是从民族形式上着眼，而是从它内容的不真实着眼的。另一方面，不发生内容是否真实问题的作品，也可能发生有没有民族形式的问题。例如我们有些作品的文字是所谓译翻体，不是老百姓所喜闻乐见。我们当然不能设想没有民族生活内容的民族形式，我们反对把内容和形式对立（如形式主义者之所为），但是，也不能把内容和形式统一的原则作为一个公式套到民族形式问题上；民族生活内容在作品中毕竟主要是个内容问题，这个内容用民族语言来表现，这才使作品具备民族形式。把民族生活内容的真实反映，归到文学作品内容的原位，并不降低了民族生活内容在民族形式的作品中的重要性，而是相反，恰恰强调了、突出了它的重要性。如果照广义论者的说法，表面上虽然好像念念不忘形式与内容的统一，而实质上却是把内容降低到形式的范畴，有背于内容决定形式的原则。我们坚决反对形式主义来钻空子，我们要严正地批判那些披着民族语言外衣而没有或者很少有民族生活内容的所谓民族形式的作品，但是我们也不能因为怕形式主义来钻空子，就把作品的内容和形式混为一谈。而且我们还不能不考虑到可能有这样的情况：一部作品在表现民族生活内容上是合格的，但是在运用民族语言上是有问题的，例如不合于语言的规范化，不为人民大众所喜闻乐见。如果照广义论者的说法，民族生活内容是作品的民族形式的居其一半的组成因素，那末，这样的作品是否也能算作一半的民族形式呢？这是反而把问题弄得复杂起来了。
    关于民族生活内容和民族形式的关系，就讲到这里为止。这段话不是闲文，因为，在小说的民族形式问题上，不可避免地要牵涉到民族生活内容的问题，而且，也是在小说方面常常会引起错觉，把民族生活内容的反映认为即是民族形式的表现。
    下面打算略谈我们的小说的民族形式问题。我想不必再费笔墨郑重指出民族形式的小说必须有充分的真实的民族生活内容，上文已经说得够多了。在这里只从形式方面谈起。
    关于小说的民族形式，通常有下列一些看法：
    认为章回体是我们的民族形式的长篇小说，笔记体（这个术语是沿用旧有的，指“太平广记”所收辑，直到清人的笔记小说）是我们的民族形式的短篇小说；认为故事有首有尾，顺序展开，是民族形式，而不按顺序，拦腰开头，则是外来的形式。这些看法，相当普遍。
    我以为这些看法都值得研究。我们可以承认，章回体、笔记体、故事顺序等等，都是我国小说长期发展过程中所创造的一些形式，而且是老百姓所喜闻乐见的；但是，我们也不能不说，这些形式在民族形式中只居于技术性的地位，而技术性的东西则是带有普遍性的，并不能作为民族形式的唯一标志。例如故事有首有尾，顺序展开，虽然是我国古典小说常用的方法，但也不是我国所独有；不按顺序、拦腰开头的写法，虽然从“五四”以后大为流行（当时的作家们受了点外来的影响也是事实），但宋人的话本“西山一窟鬼”、元、明间的话本“快嘴李翠莲记”，何尝不是拦腰开始的？“聊斋志异”的一大部分小说虽然是“某生者，某地人也……”开始，表面上像是顺序而有头有尾，但实质上只描写某生的一段遭遇，岂不也是拦腰开始？至于章回体，也许是我国所独有，然而如果持此一点以代表我国古典小说的民族形式，那就未免把民族形式问题庸俗化了。这不是正确地评价我们的古典小说的民族形式，而实在是降低了它的真正价值，歪曲了它的真正意义。
    如果一定要在我国古典小说的表现方法中找民族形式，我以为应当撇开章回体、笔记体、有头有尾、顺序展开的故事等等可以称为体裁的技术性东西，另外在小说的结构和人物形象的塑造这两方面去寻找。
    我国古典小说的结构并不是一成不变，而是有发展的；如果以“五四”为分界线，“五四”以前的小说（如李伯元、吴趼人等的作品）都算在古典小说的范围，则自宋人话本（更不用说“太平广记”之所收辑）到“孽海花”，其结构的变化发展，显然可见：由简到繁，由平面到立体，由平行到交错。这样的发展规律，本来不是我国小说所独有，但在这发展过程中，我们的长篇小说却完成了民族形式的结构。这可以用十二个字来概括：可分可合，疏密相间，似断实联。如果拿建筑做比喻，一部长篇小说可以比作一座花园，花园内一处处的楼台庭院各自成为独立完整的小单位，各有它的格局，这好比长篇小说的各章（回），各有重点、有高峰，自成局面；各有重点的各章错综相间，形成了整个小说的波澜，也好比各个自成格局、个性不同的亭台、水榭、湖山石、花树等等形成了整个花园的有雄伟也有幽雅，有辽阔也有曲折的局面。我以为我们的长篇古典小说就是依靠这种结构方法达到下列的目的：长到百万字却舒卷自如，大小故事纷纭杂综然而安排得各得其所。
    这种结构方法和人物形象塑造的方法又是密切配合的。在人物形象塑造的方法上，也显然可见我们的民族形式。
    人物形象塑造的民族形式，我以为可用下面一句话来概括：粗线条的勾勒和工笔的细描相结合。前者常用以刻划人物的性格，就是使得人物通过一连串的事故，从而表现人物的性格，而这一连串的事故通常都是用简洁有力的叙述笔调（粗线条的勾勒），很少用冗长细致的抒情笔调来表达。后者常用以描绘人物的声音笑貌，即通过对话和小动作来渲染人物的风度。
    但是，表现方法毕竟是艺术技巧，而艺术技巧是有普遍性的；因此，独立地来看表现方法还不能说这个一定是甲民族文学的民族形式，那个一定是乙民族文学的民族形式，必须结合另一个最为主要的因素，这才使得作品所具有的民族形式一定是甲民族的而不是乙民族的；这个主要的因素就是根源于民族语言而经过加工的文学语言。这个因素，在诗歌的民族形式上特别显著，在小说的民族形式上比较地不是那么显著，但不能因其不那么显著而忽略它的重要性。
    结构的特点和人物塑造的特点，在作品翻译为外国文时，常常可以照样保留着；但是，附丽于文学语言的民族语言的韵味（正由于文学语言是精练的民族语言，所以这种韵味就特别浓郁），却往往很难在别的语文中全部表达出来，有时甚至求得部分的表达也很困难。
    如果以鲁迅的作品为例，这个问题可以看得更清楚。鲁迅的作品即使是形式上最和外国小说接近的，也依然有它自己的民族形式。这就是他的文学语言。也就是这个民族形式构成了鲁迅作品的个人风格。正是这个人风格在翻译中常常会丧失。从表面上看，好像译不好，或译不出来的，只是个人风格，但实质上是民族形式。
    最后，总起来说，我以为文学的民族形式的主要因素是文学语言，但也不能忽视民族文学在长期发展过程中所创造的表现方法；同时，承认了语言因素在民族形式中的绝对重要性，并不等于否认民族形式文学翻译为外国语文的可能性。不但渗透于形式中的民族生活内容完全可以保留在外国译文的译本中，甚至艺术技巧的部分也可以迻译；这样，一部好译本既可以使读者理解原作的思想内容，也可以使读者欣赏原作的艺术形式。不能翻译的，只是原作的文学语言的独特的韵味而已。也许有人为此十分不满意，觉得那具有顽强性的民族语言大可改造为更富于弹性或适应性；但这样一来，文学的民族形式的理论就得全部更改，这也许是百年以后的事吧，恕不预测。
