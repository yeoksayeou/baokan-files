    Sananikone Publicly Declares
    Laos is Not Bound by the Geneva Accords
    The United States Hastily Expresses Support for the Lao Government's Act of Bad Faith
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 14th (via dispatch) - According to a Vientiane radio broadcast on the 13th, Lao Kingdom Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone issued a statement at a press conference held on the 11th, clarifying the Lao Kingdom government's position on issues such as the Geneva Accords on Laos and the activities of the International Commission for Laos. Sananikone said that the Lao Kingdom government cannot agree with the understanding of the Geneva Accords that the Lao Kingdom is still bound by the Geneva Accords before Vietnam has achieved reunification. He said that the Lao Kingdom "is a member state of the United Nations and can only recognize the arbitration of this high-level international organization."
    In this statement, which effectively declared that Laos was no longer bound by the Geneva Accords and denied the continued existence of the International Commission for Laos, Phoui Sananikone also stated that the Lao Kingdom government believes that the work on the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Laos and other agreements signed on behalf of the Lao Kingdom government by the Commander-in-Chief of the French Union forces at the Geneva Conference has been completed. The newly appointed Prime Minister of the Lao Kingdom concluded his statement by declaring, "The Lao Kingdom government has expressed its attitude and there will be no further misunderstandings regarding the implementation of the Geneva Accords."
    Phoui Sananikone's statement is considered a blatant violation of the Geneva Accords. According to Article 39 of the Geneva Agreement on Laos, Article 46 of the Agreement on Vietnam, and Article 25 of the Agreement on Cambodia, the three international commissions should continue to operate until the political issues of the three countries are fully resolved. The two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, also affirmed in a letter to the Indian government and the International Commission for Laos on January 31st that the International Commission for Laos' resolution on the cessation of activities on July 19, 1958, does not affect the legal provisions of the International Commission for Laos, nor does it reduce the Commission's authority in performing the tasks and responsibilities stipulated in the Geneva Accords. Phoui Sananikone's unilateral statement undermining the Geneva Accords was issued at a time when the United States, in violation of its promises made regarding the Geneva Accords, is increasingly and blatantly engaging in military intervention in Laos.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 14th - Washington: When answering questions raised by reporters on the 12th, White, the press officer of the U.S. State Department, openly expressed support for the statement issued by Lao Kingdom Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone on the 11th, which declared that Laos was no longer bound by the Geneva Accords. He said that the U.S. government "respects (the Lao government's) decision."
    According to the United States Information Service, U.S. State Department officials believe that after Phoui Sananikone issued the above statement, "the United States is now free to establish a military mission in Laos."
    The aforementioned position of the U.S. State Department regarding Phoui Sananikone's statement once again clearly exposes the connection between the United States and the Lao Kingdom government in taking actions that violate the Geneva Accords, as well as the United States' conspiracy to further militarily intervene in the Laotian situation and undermine peace in the region.

### 萨纳尼空公然声明  老挝不受日内瓦协定约束  美国赶忙表示支持老挝政府的背信行为

    萨纳尼空公然声明
    老挝不受日内瓦协定约束
    美国赶忙表示支持老挝政府的背信行为
    新华社河内14日电　据万象电台13日广播，老挝王国首相培·萨纳尼空在11日举行的记者招待会上发表声明，阐明老挝王国政府对关于老挝问题的日内瓦协定和老挝国际委员会的活动等问题的立场。萨纳尼空说，老挝王国政府不能同意对日内瓦协议的这种理解：在越南还没有实现统一的时候，老挝王国仍然受日内瓦协定的约束。他说，老挝王国“是联合国的会员国，它只能承认这个高级国际组织的仲裁”。
    培·萨纳尼空在这项实际上宣布老挝不再受日内瓦协定的约束和否认老挝国际委员会继续存在的声明中还说，老挝王国政府认为，关于老挝履行停止在老挝的敌对行动的协定和法兰西联邦部队总司令在日内瓦会议上代替老挝王国政府签订的其它各项协定的工作已经完成。这位接任不久的老挝王国首相在声明中最后宣称，“老挝王国政府已经表示了自己的态度，今后当不会再发生关于履行日内瓦协议问题的误解。”
    培·萨纳尼空的这一声明被认为是对日内瓦协议的粗暴破坏。根据日内瓦会议关于老挝问题的协定的第三十九条、关于越南问题的协定的第四十六条和关于柬埔寨问题的协定的第二十五条的规定，在三个国家的政治问题还没有完全解决以前，三个国际委员会应当继续进行活动。日内瓦会议的两位主席，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和英国外交大臣劳埃德在1月31日写给印度政府和老挝国际委员会的信中，还曾经肯定，老挝国际委员会在1958年7月19日关于停止活动的决议并不影响到老挝国际委员会的法律规定，也不减少委员会在执行日内瓦协议所规定的任务和职责方面的权限。培·萨纳尼空这项片面破坏日内瓦协议的声明，是在美国违背它对日内瓦协议所作的诺言而日益明目张胆地对老挝进行军事干涉的时候发表的。
    新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院新闻发布官怀特12日在答复记者提出的问题时，公然表示支持老挝王国首相培·萨纳尼空在11日发表的宣称老挝不再受日内瓦协定的约束的声明。他说，美国政府“尊重（老挝政府的）这项决定”。
    据美国新闻处报道，美国国务院的官员们认为，在培·萨纳尼空发表上述声明以后，“美国现在可以自由地在老挝设立一个军事使团。”
    美国国务院官员迫不及待地就培·萨纳尼空的声明表明的上述立场，再次清楚地暴露了美国同老挝王国政府采取违反日内瓦协议的行动的联系，以及美国企图进一步对老挝局势进行军事干涉和破坏这个地区的和平的阴谋。
