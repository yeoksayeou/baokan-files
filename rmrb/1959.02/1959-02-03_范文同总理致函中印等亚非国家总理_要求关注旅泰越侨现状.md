Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 2nd: According to a Vietnam News Agency report today, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam recently suggested that the governments of India, China, the United Arab Republic, Indonesia, Ceylon, Burma, and Cambodia, which participated in the Bandung Conference, pay attention to the situation of the 50,000 overseas Vietnamese residing in Thailand. He requested that the governments of these countries support the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's proposal that the governments of Vietnam and Thailand entrust their respective Red Cross societies to discuss all issues related to overseas Vietnamese in Thailand.

This request was made by the Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, in letters he wrote to Indian Prime Minister Nehru on January 21st, and to Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, United Arab Republic President Nasser, Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda, Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike, Burmese Prime Minister Ne Win, and Cambodian Prime Minister Sihanouk on January 30th, respectively.

In the letters, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said that the overseas Vietnamese in Thailand have always made a legitimate living and abided by local laws. Since the restoration of peace in Indochina, they have been eager to return home to build their country, but this issue has not been resolved until now. Since October 1958, the Thai authorities have ordered the arrest and imprisonment of more than 500 overseas Vietnamese, and intend to concentrate 50,000 overseas Vietnamese in southern Thailand and prepare to hand over more than 200 overseas Vietnamese arrested by the Thai authorities last November to the South Vietnamese authorities. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly protested against the Thai authorities' acts of violating international law, the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the spirit of the Bandung Conference, and demanded that the two sides negotiate to resolve this issue.

The letters stated that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly stated its position: demanding that the Thai government release the arrested overseas Vietnamese because they have not violated Thai law. At the same time, it is required that the Thai government arrange for them to return to their hometowns according to the wishes of the overseas Vietnamese. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is always ready to welcome overseas Vietnamese who are willing to return home; it is suggested that the governments of Vietnam and Thailand entrust the two countries' Red Cross Societies to negotiate on issues such as guaranteeing the safety of overseas Vietnamese, the property of overseas Vietnamese, and arrangements for returning to their hometowns. The negotiation venue can be chosen by Thailand, either in Thailand, in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, or in another country.

    范文同总理致函中印等亚非国家总理
    要求关注旅泰越侨现状
    新华社河内2日电　据越南通讯社今天报道，越南民主共和国政府最近建议参加万隆会议的印度、中国、阿拉伯联合共和国、印度尼西亚、锡兰、缅甸和柬埔寨各国政府关注旅居泰国的五万越南侨民的现状。他要求这些国家的政府支持越南民主共和国关于越泰两国政府委托两国的红十字会会商有关旅泰越侨的一切问题的建议。
    这种要求是由越南民主共和国总理范文同在他在1月21日写给印度总理尼赫鲁和在1月30日分别写给中华人民共和国总理周恩来、阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔、印度尼西亚总理朱安达、锡兰总理班达拉奈克、缅甸总理奈温和柬埔寨首相西哈努克的信中提出的。
    范文同总理在信里说，旅泰越侨一向合法地谋生和遵守当地法律，自从印度支那和平恢复以来，他们迫切希望回家建设祖国，但是这个问题直到现在仍未解决。自从1958年10月以来，泰国当局下令逮捕和监禁五百多名越侨，并且打算把五万越侨集中到泰国南部和准备把去年11月被泰国当局逮捕的越侨中的二百多人交给南越当局。越南民主共和国政府曾经多次抗议泰国当局违反国际法、联合国宪章、人权宣言和万隆会议精神的行为，并且要求双方谈判解决这个问题。
    信中说，越南民主共和国政府还多次表明了自己的立场是：要求泰国政府释放被捕的越侨，因为他们没有违反泰国的法律。同时要求泰国政府根据越侨的愿望安排他们回乡。越南民主共和国政府随时准备迎接愿意回国的越侨；建议越泰两国政府委托两国红十字会就有关保证越侨的安全、关于越侨的财产、安排回乡等问题进行谈判。谈判地点由泰国选择，在泰国或者在越南民主共和国、或在另外一个国家都可以。
