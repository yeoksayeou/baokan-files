Xinhua News Agency report: The cotton-growing areas of Zhejiang are actively carrying out preparations for cotton planting. In addition to large-scale fertilizer accumulation and water conservancy construction, activities such as training technical personnel, preventing and controlling insect pests, and preparing improved varieties have also been widely launched.

This year, Zhejiang Province's cotton planting area will be approximately doubled compared to last year. Not only will the cotton planting area be expanded in the old cotton-growing areas of Ningbo and Jiaxing, but new cotton-growing areas will also be opened up in the Wenzhou and Jinhua regions. Currently, the people's communes in these new cotton-growing areas have already designated fertile land for cotton planting. The old cotton-growing areas have promoted the spirit of communist mutual assistance, dispatching technical backbones with rich cotton-growing experience to the new cotton-growing areas to provide guidance. The Provincial Department of Agriculture has also sent two working groups to the new cotton-growing areas.

In order to improve cotton planting techniques, the Provincial Department of Agriculture held a cotton planting technology training class for more than 480 people at the end of last year. Subsequently, counties also held training classes or study classes. Cixi County, a major cotton producing area, has trained 1,460 people so far.

The old cotton-growing areas attach great importance to the prevention and control of insect pests, and actively carry out the prevention and control of pink bollworm before sowing cotton. Cixi County cleaned more than 31,000 cotton warehouses, eliminated more than 30,000 catties of pink bollworm, picked off more than 370,000 catties of rotten bolls, and soaked and froze 110,000 pieces of various storage and drying utensils. The vast majority of the 18 million catties of cotton seeds transported from the old cotton-growing areas to new cotton-growing areas such as Jinhua and Wenzhou have been disinfected.

This year, Zhejiang Province plans to universally select and plant the superior variety Dai Zi cotton, and has begun to carry out grain selection work on cotton seeds. This year, all people's communes are preparing to adopt nutrient pot seedling cultivation. Counties such as Cixi, Yuyao, Pinghu, and Jinhua have prepared various nutrient pot making machines. One type of pot making machine in Cixi County can make 80 nutrient pots per minute, which is ten times more efficient than making them by hand.

    浙江棉田将扩大一倍
    据新华社讯　浙江棉区积极进行植棉备耕工作。除了大规模的积肥和兴修水利以外，训练技术力量、防治虫害和准备良种等活动也已普遍展开。
    今年浙江省棉花种植面积将比去年增加一倍左右，不仅在宁波、嘉兴专区的老棉区里扩展种棉面积，还在温州、金华专区开辟了新棉区。现在，这些新棉区的人民公社，已划出了种棉花的良地。老棉区发扬了共产主义的互助精神，抽调出具有丰富种棉经验的技术骨干，到新棉区去做辅导工作。省农业厅也向新棉区派出了两个工作组。
    为了提高种棉技术，省农业厅在去年年底就开办了四百八十多人的植棉技术训练班，随后，各县也开办了训练班或学习班。棉花主要产地慈溪县目前已训练了一千四百六十人。
    老棉区对防治虫害十分重视，在播种棉花前就积极进行红铃虫的防治工作。慈溪县清理了棉仓三万一千多间，消灭了红铃虫三万多斤，摘掉烂铃三十七万多斤，还浸冻各种贮晒用具十一万件。从老棉区运往金华、温州等新棉区去的一千八百万斤棉种，绝大部分都经过消毒。
    浙江省今年准备普遍选播优良品种岱字棉，并已开始对棉种进行粒选工作。今年各人民公社都准备采用营养钵育苗。慈溪、余姚、平湖、金华等县已准备了各种营养钵制造器，慈溪县有一种制钵器每分钟能造营养钵八十只，比原来用手工做提高效率十倍。
