　　I am thirty years old this year, and the mother of two children. In the past, I was busy all day taking care of the children and cooking, a complete whirlwind, and it was impossible to participate in production. Our family of five relied solely on my husband's income, which was a heavy burden for him. After the establishment of the commune, canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens were set up. The whole family eats in the canteen, and both my daughters, Xianying and Fengxian, have entered the kindergarten. "Free from household chores," I can also happily participate in production, twisting river mud, breaking ice, and managing spring flowers. Now I can also receive a salary every month. In this way, the family income has increased, and life has become more prosperous. Our income in 1958 increased by ninety-six yuan compared to 1957. Look! The floral clothes, new pants, and thermal underwear I'm wearing now are all newly bought.

　　A few days ago, the weather was gloomy, as if it was about to snow. I was afraid the children would be cold, so I went to the kindergarten to check on them. Oh my, the whole room was steaming with warmth. Twenty-some children were gathered around the floor fire cage, stretching out their little hands, pretending to be little doves, and dancing! The one who loves children the most is the mother, but the commune mothers are even more thoughtful and love the children even more.

    从家务劳动中解放了出来
    浙江桐乡洲泉人民公社第十四管理区女社员  沈美娥
    我今年三十岁，是两个孩子的妈妈。过去一天到晚，忙着照顾孩子，烧饭，手忙脚乱，想参加生产不可能。一家五口，光凭丈夫收入，他的担子很重。公社化后，食堂、托儿所、幼儿园办起来了。全家在食堂吃饭，两个女儿仙英、凤仙都进了幼儿园。“身无家事一身轻”，我也可以高高兴兴地参加生产了，捻河泥，敲冰，春花管理我都能做。现在我每个月还可以领工资。这样，全家收入增加，生活富裕起来了。1958年收入比1957年增加了九十六元。喏！我现在身上穿的花衣服、新裤子、卫生衣都是新买的。
    前些日子，天气阴沉沉，好像要下雪了，我怕小孩子冷，就去幼儿园看望看望，吓，满房子热气腾腾，二十几个孩子围在地火笼旁边，伸出两只小手，装成小鸽子，正在跳舞哩！最疼孩子的是妈妈，公社妈妈想得更周全，更疼孩子。
