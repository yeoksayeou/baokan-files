Wooden Machinery with Ingenious Craftsmanship
Introducing a Simple and Widely Applicable Power Machine
By Our Reporters Ma Xinren and Jiao Huadong

Have you ever seen such a "machine"? It doesn't use steel, nor is it manufactured in a machine factory. It's assembled from simple parts, doesn't burn coal or oil, and when hitched to livestock, it can power all kinds of operating machinery currently used in rural areas. The windlass power machine created by the Anjia People's Commune in Wuchang County, Heilongjiang Province, is such a good tool. The structure of the windlass power machine is very simple: a windlass made using the principle of a rope traction machine, plus a few speed-changing transmission wheels and two or three transmission belts. An ordinary carpenter can make it; one cubic meter of wood can make three units.

What are the functions of this windlass power machine? Let's first take a look at the water conservancy construction site in Wuchang County. Currently, the construction of water conservancy projects in Heilongjiang Province is at its peak, and this is the coldest time of the year, and therefore the most difficult time to build water conservancy projects. The surface of the earth is frozen six feet deep, as hard as stone, but even more resilient than stone. Raising a pickaxe and digging fiercely makes one's hands numb, and only a white spot appears on the ground. Drilling a three-foot-deep hole with a chisel sometimes takes a whole day. But with the windlass power machine, just attach a drill bit to the transmission belt, and as people push or livestock pull the windlass, the drill bit drills straight into the ground with a "chih-chih" sound, and four or five drill holes can be made in a day. After putting explosives into the drill holes and blasting them, the amount of earthwork that used to take dozens of people several days to dig out can now be completed in three or four hours. The windlass power machine, with the speed-changing device removed, is placed on the top of the slope, and as the winch rotates, a line of earth-transporting sleds is quickly pulled to the top of the slope. Before using the windlass power machine, each person at the water conservancy construction site could only transport an average of 0.6 cubic meters of earth per day, but now people are no longer seen carrying or hauling earth on the slippery slope, and the average amount of earth transported per person per day has increased to 3.5 cubic meters.

However, the windlass power machine had already played a huge role in agricultural production even before water conservancy construction.

In Wuchang County, threshing was previously done with foot-operated threshing machines. But this work was not easy either; men in their twenties and thirties, using their feet and hands, exerting their whole bodies, would be covered in sweat after a few tens of minutes, and would have to be replaced after two hours. But last year, at the Anjia People's Commune in this county, next to the threshing machine driven by the windlass power machine, only elderly women were seen sitting aside untying rice bundles and handing the rice stalks to young women. The women picked up the rice stalks and put them on the rapidly rotating threshing machine, walking from one end of the threshing machine to the other, and in three to five seconds, a bundle of rice was threshed cleanly, and they could work continuously for four hours without feeling very tired. Leading cadres of the Anjia People's Commune recorded the following account: during the autumn harvest of the entire commune, a total of seventy windlass power machines were manufactured and promoted, and 80% of the rice that required laborious threshing was threshed using threshing machines driven by windlass power machines. Due to the expansion of the rice planting area in 1958, coupled with the bumper harvest, the total rice production increased by 1.3 times compared to 1957. According to the 1957 threshing progress, it would have taken four months or more to complete the threshing. However, with the use of the windlass power machine, the entire threshing was completed in twenty-five days, and the labor force invested in threshing was only half of that in 1957.

You see, the windlass power machine is so useful; but its use is not limited to this. The Red Star Management Area of the Anjia People's Commune uses two horses to turn the windlass power machine, which drives a small 400-watt generator, and the iron and wood factory, offices, and clubs can all be illuminated. The Red Star Management Area is only twelve li away from the county seat, and the city lights can be seen at night. For many years, the commune members have hoped that the village could have bright electric lights like the city, and have repeatedly planned to build small power stations, but there is no water source nearby, and even if there were a water source, the severe winter of five months could freeze all the river water, and even with a hydroelectric generator, it would not be able to turn. If thermal power generation were used, each commune member's family would have to spend more than two yuan a month on electricity. But with the windlass power machine driving a generator, commune members have already begun to be able to watch the village troupe perform programs in the bright electric light in the evening; and have dinner together under the electric light during the New Year and festivals. A windlass power machine driving a 400-watt generator still has a lot of power to spare. The Red Star Management Area is preparing to purchase a generator with even greater horsepower. According to them, as long as there is a 3,000-watt generator, every household in the village can install electric lights. The rice milling machine that the Anjia People's Commune originally designed to be powered by a diesel engine is now driven by a windlass power machine, milling 7,000 jin of rice day and night, which is equivalent to the workload of six stone mills. The crude machine tools in the iron and wood factory are also driven by the windlass power machine, and with only one donkey pulling it, the machine tool starts to rotate and cut metal. Machines driven by the windlass power machine also include a circular saw that can process 200 cubic meters of wood per day, a blower required for small blast furnaces, and a straw cutter that chops feed into fine pieces. A water pump that pumps 50 tons of water per hour has also been tested, and the pumped water can spray out four and a half to six feet away. In other people's communes, the windlass power machine is also used to drive machines for crushing raw materials for earth fertilizer, cutting soybean cakes, and weaving straw ropes, as well as stone mills for grinding tofu.

Can the windlass power machine also be used for field operations? Commune members of the rural people's commune in Wuchang County are testing the use of windlass power machines to drive seeders on the snow. The windlass power machine has the speed-changing device removed, and the windlass is equipped with wheels underneath so that it can be moved at will. Because the base of the windlass is very large, and the center of gravity is low, it is very stable, and in addition, two agricultural implements are pulled symmetrically at the same time, so there is no need to drive piles to fix it like a rope traction machine. The windlass is hung with two ten-row seeders, and by turning the winch, the two seeders can move towards each other and sow seeds. Each ten-row seeder used to require two to three horses to pull it, but with the windlass power machine, two ten-row seeders only require two horses.

How many kinds of work can the windlass power machine do? The statistics of the Anjia People's Commune are sixteen kinds, but other communes say there are twenty kinds, and still others say thirty kinds. The inconsistent numbers raise questions in people's minds: to be precise, how many uses does the windlass power machine actually have? An official from the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture believes after studying the windlass power machine: its uses are very broad. What's going on?

A professor from Northeast Agricultural College has visited the Anjia People's Commune twice to investigate the structure and function of the windlass power machine. He explained this question to reporters: The simple structure of the windlass power machine utilizes the two principles of physics: leverage and speed change, and the ratio of the size of the speed change wheel reaches nineteen to one, which greatly exceeds the provision in the book that it must not be greater than eight to one, which is the key to its ability to exert such great power. According to the technicians of the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture, the rotation speed generated by the windlass power machine can be as slow as a few tens of revolutions per minute, and as fast as one thousand eight hundred revolutions per minute. Machines with relatively large loads can also be driven at speeds up to one thousand eight hundred revolutions per minute. According to the analysis of the professor from Northeast Agricultural College, the complete windlass power machine is a power machine for rotary operations; disassembled, leaving only the windlass, it becomes a rope traction machine with a low and stable center of gravity and a changed shape, and can become the power for all linear traction tools. And the existing machines and tools in rural areas are either rotating (rotary operations) or pulling (linear traction). Therefore, the windlass power machine can be used in rural areas without encountering any obstacles. As long as you think of ways to use it, it has as many uses as you say it has.

    木机器巧夺天工
    介绍一种制造简单应用广泛的动力机
    本报记者　马新仁　焦化东
    你见过这样的“机器”吗？它不用钢铁，也不用机器工厂制造。它用简单部件合起来，不烧煤，也不烧油，套上牲口，就能够带动当前农村里各式各样的作业机具。黑龙江省五常县安家人民公社创造的绞关动力机就是这样的好工具。绞关动力机的构造很简单，一个利用绳索牵引机原理制成的绞关，加上几个变速传动的轮子和两三根传动皮带，普通木匠就能做，一立方公尺木材可以做三部。
    这种绞关动力机有些什么作用呢？我们先到五常县的水利工地上看看。当前黑龙江省兴修水利工程正是高潮，这时正是一年中间最冷，因而也是修水利最艰苦的时候。大地表面冻了六尺深，像石头那样硬，却又比石头还韧。举起洋镐猛刨，震得人虎口发木，而地面上不过打出一个白点。用钎子打一个三尺深的钻眼儿，有时候要一整天。可是用绞关动力机，只在传动皮带上套一个钻子，人推或牲口一拉绞关，钻子就哧哧地直往地里钻，一天可以打出来四、五个钻眼儿。钻眼里下上炸药爆破，以往几十个人几天才能挖出来的土方量，现在三、四个小时就完成了。绞关动力机卸去了变速装置，安放在坡顶上，绞盘转动，一列运土的爬犁，就飞快地拉上坡顶。没有用绞关动力机以前，水利工地上每人每天平均才能运零点六方土，而现在再不见人在滑坡上背、扛、挑，平均每人每天完成的运土量，却提高到三点五方。
    可是，绞关动力机在兴修水利以前已经在农业生产上发挥出巨大的作用。
    在五常县，以前用脚蹬打稻机打场。但这活也不轻，二、三十岁的汉子，脚蹬手打，全身使劲，几十分钟就满身大汗，干两个小时，就得用人替换。可是在去年这个县的安家人民公社用绞关动力机带动的打稻机旁边，只见老年妇女坐在一旁解稻捆，把稻把递给年轻的妇女。妇女们拿起稻把来搭上飞转的打稻机，从打稻机的这头走到那头，三、五秒钟一把稻子打的干干净净，一口气干上四个小时，还不觉得很累。安家人民公社领导干部记下了这样一笔账：全社秋收中共制造推广了七十部绞关动力机，80％打场费工的水稻都是用绞关动力机带动打稻机脱谷。由于1958年水稻播种面积扩大，再加上丰产，水稻总产量比1957年增加一点三倍。按1957年的打场进度，要四个月或更多的时间才能把场打完。但是使用了绞关动力机，二十五天就全部打完了场，而且投入打场的劳动力只有1957年的一半。
    你看，绞关动力机多么顶事；可是它的用途还不仅于此。安家人民公社红星管理区用两匹马转动绞关动力机，带上一个四百瓦的小发电机，铁木工厂、办公室、俱乐部都可以照明。红星管理区离县城只有十二里路，夜晚可以看见城市的灯光。好多年来，社员就希望村子里能够像城市那样有雪亮的电灯，也多次筹划建立小发电站，可是附近没有水源，就是有了水源，五个月的严冬能把河水全部冻透，有水力发电机还是不能转动。如果用火力发电，每个社员家庭一个月要支出两块多钱的电费。而绞关动力机带上发电机，社员们已经开始能够在晚间雪亮的电灯光下，看本村的剧团演节目；过年过节，在电灯光下会餐。一部绞关动力机带一个四百瓦的发电机，动力还有很大的富裕。红星管理区正在准备购买马力更大一些的发电机。据他们说只要有一个三千瓦的发电机，全村每户居民都可以安上电灯。安家人民公社原来工厂设计要用柴油动力机发动的碾米机，现在用绞关动力机带动使用，一昼夜碾米七千斤，等于六个石碾子的工作量。铁木工厂的土机床，也用绞关动力机带动，而且只用一头毛驴拉着，机床就转动起来切削金属。使用绞关动力机带动的机器，还有每天可以加工二百立方公尺木材的圆盘锯，小高炉需用的鼓风机，饲料铡的又细又碎的铡草机。每小时抽水五十吨的水泵也试验过，抽出来的水可以喷出四尺半到六尺远。在其他的人民公社里，绞关动力机还用来带动粉碎土化肥原料、切豆饼、编草绳的机器，推豆腐的石磨。
    绞关动力机在田间作业上也能够使用吗？五常县农村人民公社的社员们正在雪地上试验用绞关动力机带动播种机。绞关动力机拆去了变速装置，绞关下面装上轮子可以随意移动。因为绞关的底座很大，重心低，很稳当，再加上同时对称牵引两台农具，就不需要像绳索牵引机那样打桩固定。绞关挂上两台十行播种机，转动绞盘，两台播种机就能相向移动播种。每台十行播种机过去需用两匹到三匹马才能拉动，使用了绞关动力机的绞关，两台十行播种机才用两匹马。
    绞关动力机能干多少种活儿呢？安家人民公社的统计数字是十六种，别的公社却说有二十种，还有的说三十种。不统一的数字在人们心中引起疑问：精确地说，绞关动力机的用途到底有多少种？黑龙江省农业厅一位负责人研究了绞关动力机以后认为：它的用途很宽广。这是怎么回事呢？
    东北农学院一位教授曾经两次到过安家人民公社考查绞关动力机的构造和作用。他向记者解答了这个问题：构造简单的绞关动力机运用了杠杆作用、变速作用两条物理学上的原理，而且变速轮大小的比例达到十九比一，大大超过书本上不得大于八比一的规定，这就是它能发挥这样大的力量的关键所在。根据黑龙江农业厅技术人员测定，绞关动力机发出的转速，每分钟可以慢到十几转，快到一千八百转。每分钟转速在一千八百转以内，负荷量相当大的机器也可以带动。根据东北农学院那位教授的分析，完整成套的绞关动力机，是旋转作业的动力机；拆开来，只留下绞关，就成了重心又低又稳的形状改变了的绳索牵引机，能成为一切直线牵引工具的动力。而农村里现有的机器工具不是转的（旋转作业），就是拉的（直线牵引）。因此，绞关动力机在农村使用中，就可以无往而不利。只要你想办法利用它，说它有多少种用途，它就有多少种用途。（附图片）
