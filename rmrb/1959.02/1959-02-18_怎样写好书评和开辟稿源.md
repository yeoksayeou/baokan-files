How to Write Good Book Reviews and Develop Sources of Manuscripts
People's Education Publishing House, Wu Boxiao

I believe that the recommendation and introduction of books and periodicals cannot be generally called book reviews. For the classical works of Marxism-Leninism, we can only do some work to guide learning. Not long ago, the "Comrade Mao Zedong on Educational Work" was published, and Liu Aifeng, Deputy Minister of Education, wrote an article expounding it, which would be of great help in guiding readers to study that great document. This kind of article should not be called a book review. Furthermore, for the work summaries and bumper harvest experiences written by local party committees, and the works on the creations, inventions, and technological reforms of workers and peasants, the first thing to do should be to introduce and recommend them and widely promote them; it is not advisable to rush to comment and criticize. Some books do need to be reviewed. For example, literary and artistic creations and academic works should point out their successes, what are their advantages, what are their shortcomings and errors, and so on. In the past, some newspapers had a "Book Review" supplement, which included all articles discussing and introducing books and periodicals, and even reading notes and afterthoughts, under the name of review, which always seemed inappropriate.

Regarding the source of book review articles, I believe that every publishing house should write an article when publishing a good book, talking about the main content, advantages and disadvantages, the significance of publication, what role it will play for readers, etc., and submit it to newspapers and periodicals for publication. Doing so will naturally help readers, and it will also have a checking and supervisory effect on publishing houses, which can enhance the publishing house's sense of responsibility and improve the quality of publication. If a publishing house cannot even write such an article when publishing a book, then it is better not to publish the book; because even the publisher themselves does not know why they are publishing the book, then what is the need to publish it? Writing this type of article may be a kind of pressure for publishing houses, but combining publishing books with guiding reading is of great significance. Of course, if the readership of a book is very narrow, limited to a specific audience, this type of article may not need to be written. As for how to organize people to write these types of articles, each publishing house can think of its own methods, like writing a preface for a book, and if it becomes a trend, I think it is feasible.

Currently, few book reviews are published in newspapers and periodicals, and even fewer are good. Some book reviews are very long, and the introduction of content and quotation of original texts are often lengthy, making them difficult to read. If readers have time to read the introductory article, it is better to read the original work. The article "Introducing a Cooperative" written by Chairman Mao, and the article "My Family" written by Elder Xu and Elder Xie, are both very short, but readers want to read them again after reading them. These articles are examples for us to learn from. I really like the "Reader, Author, Editor" column in the People's Daily. The text is very short, but a question, a point of view, is expressed concisely, clearly, vividly, and interestingly. If book reviews are written in this way, readers will definitely love to read them. Of course, this form should not be the main one, let alone the only one. Longer book reviews introducing important books are also very necessary; but long book reviews should preferably not exceed two or three thousand words.

Some books already have a very wide readership, and there is no need to review them again and again. For example, "Dream of the Red Chamber" and "Tracks in the Snowy Forest" seem to have been reviewed too much. Many issues are clear to readers at a glance, and there is no need to spend much time on evaluation and introduction. Of course, some books have a bad influence, and the more they are distributed, the greater the side effects, then more reviews are necessary.

Regarding the issue of book review authors, I believe that local party committees are the force that should be organized first. Generally, it is not easy to write good evaluation articles by just discussing the book itself. Local party committees have a comprehensive understanding and have both theoretical and practical experience, so they can definitely write good articles. Secondly, the editors of publishing houses and newspapers and periodicals have an unshirkable responsibility. University students and teachers are a strong force, and middle school teachers can also be organized. In order to introduce a certain book, organizing a symposium and publishing the records is a good way to organize book reviews, and it can be tried.

    怎样写好书评和开辟稿源
    人民教育出版社　吴伯萧
    我认为对于书刊的推荐和介绍，不能一概叫做书评。对于马克思列宁主义的经典著作，就只能作一些指导学习的工作。不久以前出版的“毛泽东同志论教育工作”，教育部副部长刘皑风同志写文章作了阐述，对指导读者学习那部伟大的文献会有很大帮助。这种文章就不好叫做书评。再如各地党委写的工作总结和丰产经验，有关工人农民的创造、发明和技术改革的论著首先应当作的是介绍推荐，广为提倡；不宜忙于去评头论足，说短道长。对于有些书，是需要评论的。如文艺创作和学术论著，就须指出它的成功之处，优点是什么，有什么缺点和错误，等等。过去有的报纸有“图书评论”专刊，把所有谈论、介绍书刊的文章，甚至读书心得、读后感想，都归之于评论的名下，看来总觉不很适当。
    关于书评文章的稿源问题，我认为：每个出版社在出版一本好书的时候，都应该写出一篇文章，谈谈主要的内容、优点缺点、出版的意义、对读者会起一些什么作用等等，交给报刊发表。这样做对读者自然有帮助，对出版社也有检查督促的作用，可以增强出版社的责任感，提高出版质量。如果出版一本书，连这样一篇文章也写不出，那么书还是不出的好；因为连出版者自己都不知道为什么要出版这本书，那又有什么出版的必要？写这类文章对出版社可能是一种压力，不过出版书籍同指导读书结合起来，意义是很大的。当然，如果读者范围很窄的书，限于一定的对象，这类文章可以不写。至于怎样组织人写这类文章，各出版社可以自己想办法，像出书写序一样，成为风气，我看是行得通的。
    现在各报刊书评登得不多，好的更少。有些书评写得很长，介绍内容、引用原文也往往长篇大段，读起来很吃力。读者若有时间读介绍文章，还不如读原著。毛主席写的“介绍一个合作社”，徐老、谢老写的介绍“我的一家”的文章，都很短，但是读者读了还想读。这些文章是我们学习的榜样。我很喜欢人民日报“读者、作者、编者”一栏，文字很短，但是，一个问题，一点意见，说得扼要明确，生动有趣。这样来写书评，读者一定很爱看。当然，这种形式不应当是主要的，更不应当是唯一的。介绍重要的书籍长一些的书评也很需要；但是长的书评，最好也不要超过两、三千字。
    有些书已经有了极广泛的读者，一评再评就不必要了。如“红楼梦”和“林海雪原”，就觉得评得多了些。有许多问题，读者一看就明白，也不必多费评介笔墨。当然，有些有不好影响的书，发行越多，副作用越大，那是非多有些评论不可的。
    书评作者队伍问题，我认为地方党委是首先应该组织的力量。就书论书，一般总不容易写出好的评介文章。地方党委了解全面，有理论又有实际经验，一定能写出好文章。其次，出版社和报刊的编辑，责无旁贷。大学学生和教师，力量雄厚，中学教师也可组织。为了介绍某一本书，组织座谈会，把记录发表，是组织评书的好办法，可以试行。
