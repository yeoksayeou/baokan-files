Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The Ministry of Agriculture calls on wheat-producing provinces across the country to launch a movement for wheat yields of 1,000 jin per mu, to muster even greater enthusiasm, to vigorously grasp wheat field management, and to strive to create wheat "thousand-jin mu," "thousand-jin team," "thousand-jin commune," "thousand-jin county," and "thousand-jin special zone," and to strive for even greater leaps forward in wheat production this year compared to last year. This call was made by the Ministry of Agriculture at a telephone briefing meeting on wheat field management held on the 6th, attended by eleven provinces and cities.

Participating in this meeting were the directors of agriculture departments and bureaus from eleven provinces and cities producing wheat, including Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, Sichuan, Shanxi, Jiangxi, and Beijing. At the meeting, ten provinces including Hebei, Henan, and Shandong reported on the current situation of wheat field management. Judging from the reports of various provinces, wheat field management work started early, was large in scale, and was done well this year. Therefore, the wheat seedlings in most areas are currently growing denser and better than in previous years. Most wheat fields have 400,000 to 800,000 plants per mu, with one to three tillers. In provinces such as Hebei, Henan, Hubei, and Jiangsu, these types of wheat fields account for over 80%.

This year's wheat field management work began as soon as the wheat seedlings emerged. Party secretaries in many regions personally took charge, leading this large-scale mass movement. In provinces and cities such as Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Beijing, over 20 million people were involved in the wheat field management movement, and more than 500,000 wheat field management professional teams were organized, implementing a wheat field management responsibility system. Many regions also carried out evaluations and inspections of wheat field management work, designated high-yield areas, promoted ridge-furrow cultivation, and launched a large-scale high-yield field movement. They put forward slogans such as "the weak catch up with the strong, the late catch up with the early, and third-class seedlings catch up with first-class seedlings," and "manage wheat like embroidery, strive for a yield of 1,000 jin per mu," and wheat field management work centered on topdressing and watering continued to deepen. By the end of January, according to statistics from thirteen provinces and cities, over 230 million mu of wheat fields had been topdressed, accounting for about 70% of the wheat field area in these provinces and cities, with an average topdressing of over 10,000 jin per mu. In Henan Province, the topdressed area accounted for over 90% of the province's wheat field area, of which 40 to 50 million mu were topdressed two to three times. According to statistics from thirteen provinces and cities, the winter irrigation area of wheat fields has reached about 100 million mu, accounting for about 35% of the wheat field area in these regions. To prevent frost damage, provinces such as Shandong and Shaanxi have rolled over 10 million mu of wheat fields, and some areas in Hubei Province have carried out ditching for drainage and covering with grass and ashes. Wheat rust has occurred in provinces and cities such as Shaanxi, Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and Beijing. These areas are actively preventing and controlling it, and some have achieved preliminary results. Through these management measures such as processing, fertilizing, and watering, wheat in various places is growing vigorously, and some third-class seedlings have been upgraded and turned strong. In particular, large-scale high-yield fields are generally managed by designated personnel, with extra topdressing and watering, and the wheat seedlings are growing thicker and stronger than ordinary ones.

At the meeting, various provinces also reported on the current problems in wheat field management and future measures. Henan Province proposed to work hard on wheat field management for more than 100 days, launch a large-scale high-yield movement, and put forward ten specific measures for wheat field management. The Ministry of Agriculture believes that the specific measures in Henan Province are very good and can be learned from by various places.

Gu Dachuan, Vice Minister of Agriculture, spoke after the reports from various places. He said: The quality of wheat sowing this year is better than in any previous year: the base moisture is good, the plowing is deep, there is more base fertilizer, the seeds are good, and they are sown densely. Field management work has also been strengthened after the wheat seedlings emerged, and the current wheat growth is also better than in previous years. These are favorable conditions for striving for a greater harvest this year.

After analyzing these favorable conditions, Gu Dachuan hoped that provinces and cities would launch a wheat "thousand-jin mu" movement, to muster even more and greater enthusiasm for wheat field management, and strive for a greater leap forward this year. In order to strive for a greater wheat harvest this year, he said: Currently, we must first firmly grasp the work of accumulating fertilizer and making fertilizer, to prepare enough fertilizer for topdressing each mu of wheat three more times, and ensure the quality of the fertilizer. Pay attention to preventing spring drought. Areas with irrigation conditions should try their best to utilize them. The shortage of water lifting tools should be resolved as soon as possible, and damaged ones should be repaired quickly to meet irrigation needs. In areas with heavy rainfall, ditches should be opened for drainage to prevent waterlogging. Wheat rust, under the conditions of implementing dense planting and expanding irrigation, and with the warming of the climate in spring, has the potential to expand and spread. Various places must attach sufficient importance to this, prepare soil pesticides and machinery, and do a good job in forecasting and reporting, and promptly eliminate it. Pay attention to preventing frost. In carrying out the large-scale high-yield field movement, focus on establishing a wheat field management archive system, systematically observing and recording, to facilitate the summarization of high-yield experiences.

    农业部召开管理麦田细如绣花
    热烈开展小麦亩产千斤运动
    处处争上游努力创造小麦千斤亩千斤队千斤社千斤县千斤专区
    新华社8日讯　农业部号召全国产小麦的省份开展一个小麦亩产千斤运动，鼓起更大的干劲，狠狠地抓小麦田间管理，努力创造小麦千斤亩、千斤队、千斤社、千斤县、千斤专区，争取小麦生产今年比上年有更大的跃进。这一号召是农业部在6日召开的十一个省市小麦田间管理电话汇报会议上提出来的。
    参加这次会议的有出产小麦的河北、河南、陕西、山东、安徽、江苏、湖北、四川、山西、江西和北京等十一个省市的农业厅、局长。会上，河北、河南、山东等十个省汇报了当前小麦田间管理的情况。从各省汇报的情况看，今年小麦田间管理工作动手早，规模大，做得好。因此，目前各地麦苗大都比往年长得密、长得好，大部分麦田每亩株数四十万到八十万、分蘖一个到三个。河北、河南、湖北、江苏等省这类麦田都在80％以上。
    今年的小麦田间管理工作是从小麦一出苗就开始的。很多地区的党委书记亲自挂帅，领导这个大规模的群众运动。山西、河北、山东、河南和北京等省市投入麦田管理运动的人在两千万以上，并组织麦田管理专业队五十多万个，推行了麦田管理责任制。许多地区还开展了小麦田间管理工作的评比检查，规定了丰产方，推广了畦田化，开展大面积丰产田运动。他们提出了“弱赶强，晚赶早，三类苗赶一类苗”，“管麦如绣花，力争亩产千斤”的口号，以追肥、浇水为中心的麦田管理工作不断深入地开展起来。到1月下旬，据十三个省市的统计，麦田已施追肥的有两亿三千多万亩，占这些省市麦田面积的70％左右，一般每亩追肥在一万斤以上。河南省追肥面积占全省麦田面积的90％以上，其中有四、五千万亩追肥两遍到三遍。麦田冬灌面积，据十三个省市的统计，已达一亿亩左右，约占这些地区麦田面积的35％。为预防冻害，山东、陕西等省已镇压麦田一千多万亩，湖北等省有些地区的麦田已进行了开沟排水、盖草铺灰。小麦锈病在陕西、河北、河南、山西、北京等省市都有发生，这些地区正在积极防治，有的已获得初步成效。通过这些加工加肥加水等管理措施，各地小麦生长茁壮，部分三类苗升级转旺。特别是各地对大面积丰产田，一般都固定人员负责管理，格外追肥、浇水，麦苗比一般的长得粗，长得壮。
    会上，各省还汇报了当前小麦田间管理上的问题和今后的措施。河南省提出麦田管理大干一百多天，大搞大面积丰产运动，并且提出了十项麦田管理的具体措施。农业部认为河南省的具体措施很好，各地可以学习。
    农业部副部长顾大川在各地汇报后讲了话。他说：今年小麦播种质量比以往任何一年都好：底墒好，翻得深，底肥多，种子好，种得密，麦子出苗后又加强了田间管理工作，目前麦子生长情况也比历年都好。这些是争取今年更大丰收的有利条件。
    顾大川在分析了这些有利条件后，希望各省市开展小麦千斤亩运动，把麦田管理的劲头鼓得更足、更大，争取今年有更大的跃进。为了争取今年小麦更大的丰收，他说：当前首先紧紧抓住积肥、造肥工作，为每亩小麦再追三次肥准备足够的肥料，并要保证肥料的质量好。注意防止春旱，有灌溉条件的地区，应尽量想办法利用起来。提水工具不足的应尽快设法解决，坏了的赶快进行修理，以解决灌溉的需要。雨水多的地方，要开沟排水以防涝。小麦锈病，在实行密植、扩大灌溉的条件下，在入春气候转暖的情况下，有扩大蔓延的可能，各地对此必须有足够的重视，准备土农药械，并作好预测预报的工作，及时地扑灭。要注意防霜防冻的工作。在开展大面积高额丰产田运动中，有重点地建立麦田管理的档案制度，系统地进行观察、记载，以便于总结丰产经验。
