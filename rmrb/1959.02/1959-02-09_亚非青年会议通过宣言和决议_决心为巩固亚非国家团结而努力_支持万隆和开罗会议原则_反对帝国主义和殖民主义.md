Without the participation of the People's Republic of China, no important international issues, especially those in the Far East, can be reasonably resolved.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 8th: The Afro-Asian Youth Conference passed a resolution on youth affairs on the 7th.

The resolution recommends the establishment of a permanent Afro-Asian Youth Office, which will be affiliated to the Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference. The office should take the necessary measures to establish an Afro-Asian Youth General Federation.
