(Our newspaper's Hangzhou dispatch from the 7th) As spring arrives on the Zhoushan sea, 100,000 fishermen of Zhoushan are catching the spring season's small yellow croaker day and night.

On February 4th and 5th, thousands of fishing boats from Zhoushan crisscrossed the sea, displaying great activity. During these two days, the deep-sea fishing team of the Ant People's Commune sent ten motorized sailing boats to the Dachen fishing ground to intercept ribbonfish. They cast their nets twenty-four times each day, an increase of two net casts compared to normal days. In a few days, each pair of motorized sailing boats caught over 30,000 catties of ribbonfish and small yellow croaker.

The near-sea fishing team of the Ant Commune has also been driving stakes day and night at sea these past few days, welcoming the spring fishing season. The members broke the past habit of driving stakes for only one tide a day, and now drive stakes for two tides a day regardless of day or night, thus driving one hundred stakes in two days. At the same time, they are also casting nets while driving stakes, quickly setting up more than seven hundred net tops, in order to continue fishing during the Spring Festival, ensuring that people can rest but nets don't.

At the start of the new year, the members of the Ant People's Commune are enthusiastically discussing the fishing plan for 1959 proposed by the commune's Party committee. This plan requires this year's fish production to more than double last year's Great Leap Forward. The members' enthusiasm for production is even greater than last year, and they have put forward the slogan "Persist in fishing until New Year's Eve, return home with a good harvest to celebrate the Spring Festival!"

    舟山群岛千帆竞捕小黄鱼
    本报杭州7日电　春神刚刚降临舟山海面，舟山十万渔民日夜奋捕春汛小黄鱼。
    2月4日、5日，舟山数千条渔船纵横海上，十分活跃。这两天，蚂蚁人民公社的远洋捕鱼队，派出十条机帆船，到大陈渔场拦捕带鱼。他们每天下网二十四次，比平日增加两网，几天中每对机帆船捕到带鱼、小黄鱼三万多斤。
    蚂蚁公社的近洋捕鱼队这两天也日夜在海上打桩头，迎捕春汛。社员们打破了过去一天只打一潮桩的习惯，不分日夜一天打两潮桩，因此两天就打桩一百只。同时他们还边打桩边下网，迅速放下了七百多顶网，以便春节期间照常捕鱼，做到歇人不歇网。
    新春开始，蚂蚁人民公社的社员们热烈讨论着公社党委提出的1959年的捕鱼规划，这个规划要求今年的鱼产量比去年大跃进还要翻一番多，社员的生产劲头比去年更大，他们提出了“坚持捕鱼到除夕、丰收回家过春节”的口号。
