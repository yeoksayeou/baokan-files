Strengthening the Leading Backbone of Communes
    Shuang Wen

    Recently, many provincial and district party committees have adopted methods such as transferring cadres downward level by level or drawing a large number of outstanding cadres to strengthen the leadership of rural people's communes. This is a powerful organizational measure to strengthen the Party's leadership and run people's communes well, and an important guarantee for realizing a greater leap forward this year.

    Cadres going deep into the grassroots and strengthening specific leadership is one of the Party's important leadership methods. Implementing this method not only trains cadres and improves work but also helps to boost the enthusiasm of the masses. The news from Hubei published in today's newspaper says it well: "Cadre transfer to enrich the grassroots is one of the main experiences of Hubei Province in achieving a bumper harvest last year." Since this was the case last year, in order to achieve a greater leap forward, this year we should not ignore this main experience and should widely promote it.

    This year's advocacy of cadre transfer and strengthening commune leadership has particularly important significance. After the great movement of last autumn and winter, the whole country's rural areas have fully realized communization. This year's production is starting on the basis of communes, and the work of the communes is much more complex and heavy than that of agricultural production cooperatives. In addition, some problems from the transition from production cooperatives to communes last year still need to be reasonably addressed; after the commune framework is set up, how to reasonably arrange production and life also requires a lot of effort to rectify. Therefore, strengthening the leading backbone of communes is an urgent task to consolidate and improve the communes.

    The important issue is educating the peasants. This task has not changed today. The Sixth Plenary Session's resolution on several questions concerning people's communes pointed out that the vision of commune members cannot be limited to the circle of smaller-scale collective interests; otherwise, it will hinder the continued development of social productive forces and the continued improvement of people's consciousness. Thus, first of all, it requires commune cadres, especially the leading backbone of communes, to both love the commune, love the collective, and care for the interests of the commune at all times; and also to see higher and farther, and be able to handle various issues from the overall perspective of caring for the interests of all the people and the interests of the country. This requires commune leading cadres not only to have Party spirit but also to have a certain ideological level, relatively rich leadership experience, and extensive knowledge. From this point of view, it is also very necessary to equip communes with a group of leading backbone personnel who have a strong Party spirit, a high ideological level, and relatively rich leadership experience. At present, the communes have only been established for a short time, and the work of rectification and consolidation is underway. A new and greater leap forward has already begun. It is hoped that Party committees at all levels will fully value the work of strengthening the leading backbone of communes, which is an extremely important aspect of ensuring a greater leap forward this year.

    加强公社的领导骨干
    双文
    最近，许多省委和地委都采取了层层下放干部，或者是抽调大批优秀干部的办法加强农村人民公社的领导。这是加强党的领导、办好人民公社的一项有力的组织措施，是实现今年更大的跃进的重要保证。
    干部深入基层，加强具体领导，这是党的重要领导方法之一。贯彻执行这个方法，既锻炼了干部，改进了工作，也更有利于鼓舞群众的干劲。今天本报发表的湖北的消息说得好：“干部下放，充实基层，是湖北省去年取得丰收的主要经验之一。”既然去年如此，那末为了实现更大的跃进，今年自然更不应该忽视这一条主要经验，更应该广泛地推广这一经验。
    今年提倡干部下放，加强公社领导，还有特殊重要的意义。经过去年秋冬两季大运动，全国农村已经全部实现公社化了。今年的生产，一开始就是在公社的基础上进行的，而公社的工作，比之农业生产合作社，要复杂繁重得多。加之去年由生产合作社转公社时有些问题还需继续合理处理；公社搭起架子后，生产和生活如何合理安排，也需要用很多工夫去加以整顿，因此，目前加强公社领导骨干，也是巩固和提高公社的一项刻不容缓的任务。
    重要的问题是教育农民。这个任务今天并没有改变。六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议中指出，不能让公社社员的眼光只是局限在较小范围的集体利益的圈子里，不然，就将妨碍社会生产力的继续发展和人民觉悟的继续提高。这样，首先就要求公社干部，特别是公社的领导骨干，既热爱公社热爱集体，时时刻刻关怀公社利益；又要看得更高更远，能够从关心全民利益国家利益的全局观点出发来处理各种问题。这就要求公社领导干部不仅需要党性，还需要有一定的思想水平、比较丰富的领导经验和广泛的知识。从这个意义上看，给公社配备一批党性强、思想水平较高、领导经验比较丰富的领导骨干，也十分必要。目前，公社刚刚成立不久，现正在进行整顿和巩固的工作，新的更大的跃进又已经开始，希望各级党委充分重视加强公社领导骨干的工作，这是保证今年更大跃进的一个极其重要的方面。
