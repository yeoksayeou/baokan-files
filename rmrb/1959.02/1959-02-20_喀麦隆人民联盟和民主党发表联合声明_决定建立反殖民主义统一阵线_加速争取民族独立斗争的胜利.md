Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 18th. Two major political parties in Cameroon issued a joint statement here on the 18th, aiming to achieve reconciliation on the basis of promoting the national cause.

The statement was signed by Ernest Ouandié, Vice President of the Cameroon People's Union, and André-Marie Mbida, President of the Cameroon Democratic Party. Ouandié personally read the statement at a press conference held on the 18th. The statement said that the two leaders held talks in Conakry (Guinea) on January 23, and former Cameroonian Prime Minister Mbida decided to abandon his demand for "gradual independence" and expressed his willingness to cooperate with the Cameroon People's Union.

The minimum common program agreed upon by both parties is: 1. Complete and unconditional amnesty for all political prisoners; 2. Allow all deported political prisoners to return to the country; 3. Withdraw the troops carrying out suppression activities in Cameroon; 4. Dissolve the current Legislative Assembly chaired by France; 5. Hold a referendum on the reunification of Cameroon, and then hold a general election to establish a national constituent assembly. In order to supervise the elections, a committee should be established by the upcoming special session of the United Nations General Assembly, and the majority of its members should come from anti-colonial countries. The Cameroonian government established after the general election should enjoy all powers and should be the only qualified organization to conduct negotiations with international organizations regarding the termination of trusteeship.

The joint statement said that the Cameroon People's Union and the Cameroon Democratic Party signed this minimum common program, hoping to prove their belief that only a united and anti-colonialist front can accelerate the victory of the Cameroonian people. They hope that all parties and individuals with this belief will support this front.

The joint statement also called on the governments and people of all African countries to support the cause of Cameroon, and expressed its willingness to establish new relations with France, Britain, and all countries willing to cooperate on the basis of equality and mutual respect. The statement also condemned France's merger policy and expressed its determination to fight against this policy.

When explaining this statement, Ouandié said that the reconciliation of the two parties showed that the Cameroon issue had matured. He also pointed out that even former Cameroonian Prime Minister Mbida had raised doubts about the legitimacy of the Legislative Assembly chaired by France, which showed how unrepresentative this assembly was. He said that the United Nations delegation that visited Cameroon last November recommended in its report that the existing French-made constitution be maintained. He concluded by saying, "But we hope that the United Nations will seriously consider the examples of Iraq and Cuba and not disgrace itself by supporting a regime that will soon be driven away by the power of the people."

    喀麦隆人民联盟和民主党发表联合声明
    决定建立反殖民主义统一阵线
    加速争取民族独立斗争的胜利
    新华社开罗18日电　喀麦隆的两个主要政党18日在这里发表了一项目的在于在促进民族事业的基础上实现和解的联合声明。
    声明是由喀麦隆人民联盟副主席欧内斯特·乌安迪和喀麦隆民主党主席安德烈—马里·姆比达签署的。乌安迪亲自在18日举行的记者招待会上宣读了这一声明。声明说，两位领袖1月23日在科纳克里（几内亚）举行了会谈，前喀麦隆总理姆比达决定放弃他的“逐步取得独立”的要求，并且表示愿意同喀麦隆人民联盟进行合作。
    双方同意的最低共同纲领是：一、全部和无条件地赦免所有政治犯；二、让所有被驱逐的政治犯回国；三、撤走在喀麦隆进行镇压活动的军队；四、解散目前的由法国主持的立法议会；五、就喀麦隆重新统一的问题举行公民投票，然后举行大选以便成立一个全国制宪议会。为了监督选举，即将举行的联合国大会特别会议应当成立一个委员会，它的大多数委员应当来自反殖民主义国家。在大选以后成立的喀麦隆政府应当享有一切权力，并且应当成为同国际组织进行关于结束托管的谈判的唯一有资格的组织。
    联合声明说，喀麦隆人民联盟和喀麦隆民主党签订这项最低共同纲领，是希望证明它们的信念：只有一个统一的和反殖民主义的阵线才能够加速喀麦隆人民的胜利。它们希望具有这种信念的所有党派和个人支援这个阵线。
    联合声明还要求非洲所有国家的政府和人民支持喀麦隆的事业，并且表示愿意在平等和互相尊重的基础上同法国、英国和所有愿意在这个基础上进行合作的国家建立新的关系。声明还谴责法国的合并政策，并且表示决心要对这一政策进行斗争。
    乌安迪解释这项声明的时候说，两党的和解表明了喀麦隆问题已经成熟了。他还指出，甚至前喀麦隆总理姆比达对于法国主持的立法议会的合法性都提出了怀疑，这表明这个议会是多么没有代表性。他说，去年11月访问喀麦隆的联合国代表团在它的报告中建议保持现有的法国制订的宪法。他最后说，“但是我们希望联合国会认真地考虑伊拉克和古巴的例子，不要由于支持一个不久将会被人民力量赶走的政权而使自己丢脸。”
