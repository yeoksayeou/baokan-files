According to Tianjin Daily news, the Party General Branch of the Chemistry Department of Nankai University pays attention to giving play to the academic specializations of veteran teachers, helping them connect with practical production, and closely integrate with students, so that they can better play their roles in teaching, scientific research, and guiding young teachers.

After the education of the rectification movement and the Great Leap Forward situation, the veteran teachers of the Chemistry Department have improved politically and ideologically, and have taken a big step forward on the road of ideological transformation. Especially after the summer vacation of 1958, when Nankai University launched a movement to engage in scientific research and run factories in a big way in implementing the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, many veteran teachers strengthened their awareness of serving the proletariat's education and scientific and cultural undertakings. With the care of the Party and multifaceted assistance, all teachers and students of the department, after forty-five days of hard work, completed a total of 1,066 scientific research projects and achieved great results. In these scientific research achievements, many veteran teachers contributed their efforts. After the start of the new academic year in 1958, the Party organization of the Chemistry Department further paid attention to giving play to the role of veteran teachers. For example, according to the urgent needs of national construction, the department prepared a specialized course – "Polymer Chemistry". Professor He Binglin, who is in charge of the teaching and research group of this subject, was initially unconfident when accepting this task, thinking that the conditions were not mature enough, the instruments, equipment, and books and materials were relatively lacking, and the time for starting the course was very tight, and he was worried that he would not be able to start the course on time. However, encouraged by the Party organization and inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the young teachers, Professor He Binglin, considering the needs of national construction, finally accepted this new task, and together with the young teachers discussed and formulated the teaching syllabus and teaching plan, and compiled the lecture notes for the basic course of polymer chemistry in a very short time. After the start of the course, in the weekly course group meetings, the spirit of "three combinations" could also be implemented, striving to improve teaching and improve teaching quality. When lecturing on the chapter of polymer chemistry polymerization reaction, he adopted the correct opinions put forward by the students, improved the teaching method, made it easy for students to understand, and the effect was very good.

In teaching, many veteran teachers have now changed the old method of preparing lessons behind closed doors in the past, and began to pay attention to listening to students' opinions, and discussing teaching plans, course content, and teaching requirements with young teachers and students. Professor Wang Jitao, director of the Organic Chemistry Teaching and Research Group, based on the suggestions made by the students in the big-character posters, merged the two courses of organic synthesis and organic structure theory into one course of advanced organic chemistry, deleted the repeated content of the original two courses, reorganized the textbook content, and made the scientific nature and system of the course more perfect, thereby drawing up a new teaching syllabus. Professor Chen Rongti of the Physical Chemistry Teaching and Research Group actively prepared lessons based on students' opinions on the basic course of thermodynamics, and often listened to students' and young teachers' opinions to improve teaching. In scientific research, thanks to the encouragement of the Party, many veteran teachers paid attention to closely combining with young teachers and students, jointly formulating scientific research plans, and strengthening specific guidance for young teachers and students, and paying attention to training young teachers in teaching work. For example, Professor Qiu Zongyue, the director of the department, although old and weak and on long-term recuperation, took the initiative to participate in this research work when he heard that young teachers and students were carrying out scientific research on fuel cells, looking for and translating relevant foreign language materials, enthusiastically giving guidance, and making a theoretical explanation on fuel cells at the scientific research work discussion meeting, carefully analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of various fuel cells, helping young teachers and students determine the research direction and pointing out the research methods to be adopted. Professor Chen Ruyu of the Organic Chemistry Teaching and Research Group changed the past research method of belittling practice and being divorced from reality, accepted the research on an important topic in afforestation work, helped young teachers determine the research route, worked hard with young teachers, and proposed to make research results as soon as possible. Fang Sunan, a young teacher of the Organic Chemistry Teaching and Research Group, taught the ordinary organic chemistry course for the first time, and was actively responsible and enthusiastic in teaching, but lacked experience. Professor Wang Jitao, director of the Organic Chemistry Teaching and Research Group, personally helped Fang Sunan teach organic chemistry, and held meetings with young teachers based on students' opinions to study and improve the teaching method and improve the teaching quality.

In the teaching reform, some veteran teachers in the department have encountered some specific difficulties in their work, and their thinking is not very clear on how to better play their roles in teaching. For these problems, the Party and administration of the Chemistry Department have repeatedly studied them, properly arranged teaching and scientific research according to their specializations, strengthened ideological education, and often adopted individual talks and small forums to eliminate some unnecessary concerns and improve their awareness. In order to further play the role of veteran teachers in teaching, the Party and administration of the Chemistry Department have also convened meetings of teaching and research group directors and meetings of veteran teachers to study the basic experience of teaching reform and engaging in scientific research in a big way, discuss specific problems in teaching and scientific research work, help veteran teachers clarify their thinking, and encourage them to further improve their work. At the same time, they are also encouraged and supported to visit some production units in Shanghai, Nanjing, Northeast China, and other places, so that they can increase some perceptual knowledge, connect with practical production, and enrich the content of scientific research and teaching.

    在党组织的亲切关怀和多方面帮助下
    南开化学系老教师发挥专长
    据天津日报消息　南开大学化学系党总支注意发挥老教师的学术专长，帮助他们联系生产实际，和学生密切结合，使他们在教学、科学研究和指导青年教师等方面更好地发挥作用。
    经过整风运动和大跃进形势的教育，化学系的老教师们在政治上思想上都有了提高，在思想改造的道路上大大向前迈进了一步。特别是1958年暑假，南开大学在贯彻党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针中掀起了大搞科学研究、大办工厂运动之后，许多老教师加强了为无产阶级的教育和科学文化事业服务的自觉性。在党的关怀和多方面的帮助下，全系师生经过四十五天的奋战，共完成了一千零六十六项科学研究项目，取得了巨大的成绩。在这些科学研究成果中，许多老教师贡献了自己的力量。1958年新学年开始以后，化学系党组织进一步注意发挥老教师的作用。如该系根据国家建设的迫切需要，筹办了一个专门化的课程——“高分子化学”。负责这个学科教研组工作的何炳林教授，在接受这个任务时，开始信心不足，认为条件不够成熟，仪器设备和书籍资料比较缺乏，而开课的时间又很紧迫，担心不能按时开课。但是，在党组织的鼓励和青年教师革命干劲的鼓舞下，何炳林教授考虑到国家建设的需要，终于接受了这个新的任务，和青年教师一起讨论制订了教学大纲、教学计划，并在很短的时间内编写出了高分子化学基础课程的讲稿。开课之后，在每周举行的课程小组会中，也能贯彻“三结合”的精神，努力改进教学，提高教学质量。在讲授高分子化学聚合反应一章时，他采纳了学生提出的正确意见，改进了教学方法，使学生容易理解，效果很好。
    在教学中，不少老教师现在已经改变了过去闭门备课的老方法，开始注意听取学生的意见，和青年教师、学生一起讨论教学计划、课程内容和教学要求。有机化学教研组主任王积涛教授，根据学生们在大字报中提出的建议，将有机合成和有机结构理论两门课，合并为一门高等有机化学，删去了原来两门课重复的内容，重新组织了教材内容，使课程的科学性和系统性更加完善，从而拟出了新的教学大纲。物理化学教研组陈荣悌教授，根据学生对热力学基础课程的意见积极备课，并经常听取学生和青年教师的意见改进教学。在科学研究中，由于党的鼓励，很多老教师注意和青年教师、学生紧密结合，共同制订了科学研究的规划，并对青年教师和学生加强具体指导，在教学工作中注意培养青年教师。如系主任丘宗岳教授，虽然年老体衰长期休养，但当他听到青年教师和学生正在开展燃料电池的科学研究之后，便主动地参加这项研究工作，寻找和翻译有关外文资料，热情地给以指导，并在科学研究工作讨论会上，作了关于燃料电池的理论讲解，仔细分析了各种燃料电池的优缺点，帮助青年师生确定研究方向和指出应采取的研究方法。有机化学教研组陈茹玉教授改变了过去轻视实践、脱离实际的研究方法，接受了造林工作上某项重要题目的研究，帮助青年教师确定了研究路线，和青年教师一起苦战，并提出要早日做出研究成果。有机化学教研组青年教师方苏南第一次开普通有机化学课，在教学中积极负责，热情很高，但缺乏经验。有机化学教研组主任王积涛教授就亲自帮助方苏南试讲有机化学，并根据学生意见和青年教师一道开碰头会，研究改进讲授方法，提高教学质量。
    在教学改革中，该系一些老教师在业务上曾碰到一些具体困难，对如何在教学工作中更好发挥作用，思想上也不很明确。对于这些问题，化学系党和行政曾反复作过研究，根据他们的专长，妥善安排教学和科学研究，并加强思想教育，经常采取个别谈心和小型座谈会等方式，解除一些不必要的顾虑，提高他们的觉悟。为了进一步发挥老教师在教学中的作用，化学系党和行政并曾召开教研组主任会议和老教师会议，研究教学改革和大搞科学研究的基本经验，讨论教学和科学研究工作中的具体问题，帮助老教师明确思想，鼓励他们进一步搞好工作。同时，还鼓励和支持他们到上海、南京、东北等地参观访问一些生产单位，使他们增加一些感性知识，联系生产实际，丰富科学研究和教学的内容。
