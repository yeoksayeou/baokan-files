    Enthusiastically Hail the Soviet Union's Entry into the Period of Comprehensive Construction of a Communist Society!
    The 21st Congress of the CPSU Triumphantly Concluded
    Khrushchev stated in his concluding remarks: The congress embodied the determination to implement the communist construction plan and defend peace. The congress passed a resolution on Comrade Khrushchev's report and approved the control figures for the Seven-Year Plan.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 5th: The momentous and historically significant 21st Extraordinary Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which lasted nine days, triumphantly concluded in Moscow at 2:40 PM Moscow time today amidst a warm and solemn atmosphere. This congress declared that the Soviet Union had entered a period of comprehensively unfolding the construction of a communist society, and it will be recorded in Soviet history as the congress of communist builders.
    The congress opened on January 27th in the Kremlin, Moscow. A total of 1,375 delegates attended the congress. The congress heard a report by Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, on the "Control Figures for the Development of the National Economy of the USSR for 1959-1965," and conducted an in-depth and detailed discussion of this report. A total of 86 delegates spoke at the congress, including leading comrades of the Central Committee of the CPSU, representatives from all parts of the Soviet Union, as well as model workers in the industrial and agricultural sectors and outstanding representatives of the cultural, technical, and scientific sectors. In their speeches, they spoke about the achievements and future development prospects of the Soviet Union and various regions of the Soviet Union in developing the national economy, expressing the will and aspirations of the Soviet people. They unanimously endorsed the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan and expressed their determination to fight with full confidence to realize this great plan.
    Delegations from 72 fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties participated in this congress. Representatives of the fraternal parties delivered congratulatory messages at the meeting, expressing the love of the working class and working people around the world for the Soviet people and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and congratulating the Soviet Union on its victories in building communism.
    The congress was filled with enthusiastic emotions from beginning to end, overflowing with an optimistic atmosphere of advancing victoriously for the cause of communism.
    Today's meeting of the congress began at 10:00 AM. After the delegates continued to speak, the discussion of Comrade Khrushchev's report concluded at 12:00 PM.
    Then, Comrade Khrushchev made a concluding speech.
    Khrushchev said that this congress vividly demonstrated the rock-solid unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the high level of enthusiasm of the party organizations and all Communist Party members. He also pointed out that the congratulatory messages from the representatives of the fraternal parties attending the congress and the congratulatory telegrams from the fraternal parties to the congress, as well as the meetings between the representatives of the fraternal parties and the delegates to the congress and the working people of Moscow, vividly demonstrated the consistency and unity of the international communist movement on the basis of Marxism-Leninism.
    Khrushchev said that our party and the Soviet people consider it their internationalist obligation to constantly strengthen friendship and proletarian solidarity with the working people and progressive forces all over the world, consolidate the powerful socialist camp, and constantly strive for international peace. He emphasized that the work of the congress embodies the determination of the party and all the Soviet people to implement the communist construction plan and the desire to make every effort to defend peace and ensure the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems. He said that this is the most important characteristic of our congress.
    Khrushchev then talked about some issues of the international situation. Referring to the recent remarks of US President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, Secretary of State Dulles, and others, he pointed out that in these people's remarks, the call to be vigilant and the presentation of various doubts give the impression that the old set of warmongering terms are being brought out again. Khrushchev said that it can be seen from this that certain groups in the United States want to nullify some of the warmth in the relations between our two countries, a warmth that has arisen in recent times, especially due to Mikoyan's good reception in the United States.
    Khrushchev said that American military and political figures often say that the United States has more favorable military conditions than the Soviet Union because they have a network of military bases within the territory of European and Asian countries that can launch attacks on the Soviet Union, while the Soviet Union, they say, has fewer intercontinental rockets. Therefore, it is said that war is not so threatening to the United States. Khrushchev said that this is no longer in line with reality, and it is just wishful thinking on the part of the American generals. It should be known that the Soviet Union now, in fact, possesses the means to strike any aggressor anywhere on the globe. We say that we have arranged for the mass production of intercontinental ballistic rockets, and this is not to brag, nor is it to scare anyone, but to make the true situation clear.
    Khrushchev talked about the issue of improving relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. He said that not long ago, the governments of the Soviet Union and the United States exchanged rather sharp letters. This was because at that time, we were talking about very sharp issues in the international situation. He said that now these have become things of the past, and we should look to the future. We believe that if the US President and other leaders truly want peace, as they said in their talks with Mikoyan, they will recognize the necessity of peaceful coexistence among nations and establish relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries on this basis.
    When discussing the Berlin issue and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, Khrushchev compared the situation in West Berlin to a lit fuse in a powder magazine or a time bomb, the installation of which could lead to an explosion at any time. He went on to say, therefore, we are prepared to participate with the United States, Britain and France in formulating a principle that can ensure the normal development of West Berlin, ensure the city's ties with all the countries with which it wishes to establish relations, and ensure that these countries enter the free city. We also agree that the United Nations should participate in observing the status of a free city and are willing to discuss the way in which it can participate in this matter.
    Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union took the initiative and put forward its draft peace treaty with Germany. If the United States has any objections to this draft or has any special hopes that should be reflected in the treaty, then no one is preventing them from expressing their views. The recommendation to convene a peace conference is precisely for this reason.
    Khrushchev said that if the people of the two Germanys want to hold free elections, the Soviet Union does not object to holding such elections, but there must be no interference from third parties.
    Khrushchev said that it can be predicted that after a certain period, the Germans will want to hold free elections in order to eliminate the capitalist system in West Germany. It seems that Chancellor Adenauer will not allow this to happen, but this is entirely possible. However, this is a matter for the Germans themselves.
    When talking about the issue of stopping nuclear tests, Khrushchev said that we advocate establishing appropriate supervision over the cessation of nuclear tests. But we will not allow Western countries to infringe on our sovereignty under the guise of supervision. We hope to reach an agreement on stopping nuclear tests as soon as possible. We are ready to sign a treaty on this issue at any time, a treaty that should be based on reasonable conditions and ensure the necessary supervision of explosions.
    Khrushchev pointed out that the work of the congress has greatly angered the Yugoslav revisionists. Articles have appeared in the Yugoslav newspapers, in which clumsy attempts are made to defend the revisionist policy, to conceal from the Yugoslav people the Soviet Union's desire to cooperate with Yugoslavia, and to distort the truth of the relationship formed between Yugoslavia and the socialist countries. The Yugoslav leaders are using their revisionist policies to split the revolutionary forces of the working class who are fighting for the fundamental interests of the working people.
    In order to prove their conjecture that "there are differences between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China," the Yugoslav revisionists did not hesitate to bring up US Senator Humphrey as a witness. This fact shows how dirty and provocative methods they have adopted in order to damage the unity of the socialist countries. Khrushchev finally said that thousands of years will pass, but the glory of our heroic era - the era of building socialism and communism - will never diminish.
    As Khrushchev spoke, sunlight shone through the windows into the venue, making the solemn hall even more splendid and bright. Khrushchev's concluding speech lasted one hour and forty minutes and was constantly interrupted by warm applause. When he finished speaking, the entire audience stood up again and applauded warmly for a long time.
    Subsequently, Suslov, a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU, asked the congress to adopt the resolution on Comrade Khrushchev's report drafted by the resolution drafting committee. All the delegates unanimously raised their red delegate cards and passed the resolution.
    The congress also unanimously approved the "Control Figures for the Development of the National Economy of the USSR for 1959-1965."
    Then, Comrade Khrushchev, on behalf of the presidium of the congress, proposed that the congress pass a resolution on holding the 22nd regular congress of the CPSU in 1961 instead of 1960. The delegates to the congress unanimously passed this resolution.
    Afterwards, Comrade Khrushchev announced to the congress that the agenda was over and the 21st Extraordinary Congress of the CPSU was now closed. At this time, all the delegates and guests of the congress stood up and sang "The Internationale" in unison, the song symbolizing the great unity of proletarian internationalism and the confidence of the Soviet people in advancing towards the victory of communism.
    The delegates warmly cheered and shouted slogans to congratulate the successful conclusion of the congress.

    热烈欢呼苏联进入全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期！
    苏共第二十一次代表大会胜利闭幕
    赫鲁晓夫在总结发言中说：大会体现了贯彻共产主义建设计划和保卫和平的决心大会通过了关于赫鲁晓夫同志报告的决议，批准了七年计划的控制数字
    新华社莫斯科5日电　历时九天的、有重大历史意义的苏联共产党第二十一次非常代表大会，今天在莫斯科时间十四时四十分在热烈隆重的气氛中宣告胜利闭幕。这次大会宣布苏联已进入了全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期，它将作为共产主义建设者的代表大会列入苏联史册。
    这次代表大会在1月27日在莫斯科克里姆林宫开幕。出席大会的共有一千三百七十五名代表。大会听取了苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫作的“1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的控制数字”的报告，并对这一报告进行了深入详尽的讨论。在大会上发言的共有八十六名代表，其中包括苏共中央各领导同志，来自苏联各地的代表，以及工业、农业部门的模范人物和文化技术科学部门的优秀代表。他们在发言中谈到了全苏联和苏联各地区在发展国民经济方面取得的成就和今后的发展远景，表达了苏联人民的意志和愿望。他们一致赞同七年计划的控制数字，并表示要满怀信心地为实现这一伟大计划而斗争。
    有七十二个兄弟共产党和工人党的代表团参加了这次代表大会。各兄弟党的代表在会上致了贺词，表达了全世界工人阶级和劳动人民对苏联人民和苏联共产党的热爱，并且祝贺苏联在建设共产主义方面取得胜利。
    大会自始至终充满着热烈的情绪，洋溢着为共产主义事业胜利前进的乐观气氛。
    代表大会今天的会议在上午十时开始。在代表们继续发言后，在十二时结束了对赫鲁晓夫同志的报告的讨论。
    接着，赫鲁晓夫同志作了总结发言。
    赫鲁晓夫说，这次大会鲜明地显示了苏联共产党磐石般的团结一致，显示了党组织和全体共产党员的高度积极性。他同时指出，出席代表大会的各兄弟党代表的贺词和各兄弟党给代表大会的贺电以及兄弟党代表同代表大会代表、同莫斯科劳动人民的会见，生动地显示了国际共产主义运动在马克思列宁主义基础上的一致和团结。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们党和苏联人民认为自己的国际主义义务是不断加强同全世界劳动人民和进步力量的友谊与无产阶级团结，巩固强大的社会主义阵营，不断为国际和平而奋斗。他强调指出，代表大会的工作体现了党和全体苏联人民贯彻共产主义建设计划的决心，体现了要尽一切努力来保卫和平，保证不同社会制度的国家和平共处的愿望。他说，我们代表大会的极重要的特点就在于此。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到国际局势的某些问题。他在谈到美国总统艾森豪威尔、副总统尼克松、国务卿杜勒斯等人最近的言论时指出，在这些人的言论中，叫喊要提高警惕，并提出种种怀疑，使人感到又在搬出老一套的好战术语。赫鲁晓夫说，由此可见，美国某些集团想把我们两国关系中的某些热气化为乌有，这种热气是在最近一段期间，特别是由于米高扬在美国受到很好接待而产生的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，美国军政界人士经常说，美国在军事方面的条件比苏联更为有利，因为他们在欧洲和亚洲国家境内拥有可以对苏联发动进攻的军事基地网，而苏联，据他们说，洲际火箭还少。因此，据说，战争对美国来讲威胁性并不那么大。赫鲁晓夫说，这一点早就不符合现实了，这只不过是美国将军们的痴心妄想。要知道，苏联现在事实上已拥有能给地球上任何地方的侵略者以打击的手段。我们说我们已安排好了洲际弹道火箭的成批生产，这并不是为了说大话，也不是为了要吓唬什么人，而是为了要把事情的真实情况讲清楚。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到了改善美苏两国的关系问题。他说，不久以前，苏美两国政府曾经互换了相当尖锐的信件。这是因为，当时谈的是国际局势中非常尖锐的问题。他说，现在这些已经成为往事了，我们应当展望未来。我们相信，如果美国总统和其他领导人能像他们在同米高扬交谈时所说的那样，真正希望和平，他们就会承认各国和平共处的必要性，并在这个基础上同苏联和其他社会主义国家建立关系。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到柏林问题和缔结对德和约问题时把西柏林的局势比作火药库里燃着的导火线或定时炸弹，它们的装置随时都可能导致爆炸。他接着说，因此，我们准备同美国、英国、法国一道参加来拟定一种原则，这种原则要能够保证西柏林的正常发展，保证这个城市同它所愿意与之建立关系的一切国家的联系，以及保证这些国家进入自由城市。我们并且同意联合国参加遵守自由城市的地位，并且愿意讨论它可以在那一种方式下参与这件事。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联表现了主动，提出了自己的对德和约草案。如果美国对这个草案有意见或有某些特别希望应该在和约中反映出来的话，那末谁也没有阻碍他们发表自己的意见。建议召开和会正是为了这点。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果两个德国的人民愿意举行自由选举的话，苏联不反对举行这种选举，但是不得有第三者的干涉。
    赫鲁晓夫说，可以预料，经过一定时期，德国人将想举行自由选举，以便消灭西德的资本主义制度。看来，阿登纳总理不会允许有这种作法，而这种作法是完全可能的。然而这是德国人自己的事情。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到停止核试验谈判的问题时说，我们主张对停止核试验建立适当的监督。但是我们不许西方国家在监督的幌子下侵犯我国的主权。我们希望尽速达成停止核试验协议。我们准备随时签订关于这个问题的条约，这个条约应以合理的条件为基础，并保证对爆炸进行必要的监督。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，代表大会的工作使南斯拉夫修正主义者极为恼怒。在南斯拉夫的报刊上出现了一些文章，文章中拙劣地企图为修正主义政策辩解，企图对南斯拉夫人民隐瞒苏联有同南斯拉夫合作的愿望，企图歪曲南斯拉夫和社会主义国家之间所形成的关系的真相。南斯拉夫领导人正在用他们的修正主义政策来分裂为劳动人民根本利益而奋斗的工人阶级的革命力量。
    南斯拉夫修正主义者为了证明他们所设想的似乎“苏联和中华人民共和国之间存在分歧”的臆测，竟不惜抬出美国参议员汉弗莱作为证人。这个事实表明，他们为了要损害社会主义国家的团结，竟然采取了多么肮脏的挑衅手法。赫鲁晓夫最后说，千秋万世将会过去，但是我们英雄的时代——建设社会主义和共产主义时代的荣耀将永远不会减色。
    在赫鲁晓夫讲话时，阳光正透过窗户照射着会场，使这个庄严的大厅显得更加辉煌明亮。赫鲁晓夫的总结发言历时一小时四十分，不断被热烈的掌声所打断。他发言结束时，全场再次起立，长时间地热烈鼓掌。
    随后，苏共中央主席团委员苏斯洛夫提请代表大会通过决议起草委员会起草的关于赫鲁晓夫同志报告的决议。全体代表一致举起红色代表证，通过了这一决议。
    大会还一致批准了“1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的控制数字”。
    接着，赫鲁晓夫同志以代表大会主席团的名义提议大会通过关于在1961年、而不在1960年召开苏共第二十二次定期代表大会的决议。代表大会代表一致通过了这个决议。
    随后，赫鲁晓夫同志向大会宣布，议程已经结束，苏共第二十一次非常代表大会至此闭幕。这时，代表大会全体代表和来宾一致起立，高唱“国际歌”，这歌声象征着无产阶级国际主义大团结，象征着苏联人民向共产主义胜利前进的信心。
    代表们热烈欢呼并高呼口号，祝贺代表大会胜利闭幕。
