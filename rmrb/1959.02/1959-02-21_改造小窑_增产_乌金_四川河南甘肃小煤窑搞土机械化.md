Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 20th: Sichuan Province is extensively transforming nearly a hundred counties' small coal mines to increase coal production. This year, plans are in place to transform over seven thousand small coal mines, with a focus on two thousand small mines, each with an annual production capacity of over ten thousand tons, located near small blast furnace clusters and along transportation routes.

Small coal mines are a vital and rapidly growing force in Sichuan Province's coal industry. In the short four months from September to December last year, the number of small coal mines in Sichuan Province surged from over eight thousand to over thirty-six thousand. Last year, these small coal mines produced a total of more than 18 million tons of raw coal, accounting for more than 70% of the province's raw coal production.

Based on the layout of the iron and steel industry, and adhering to the principle of focusing on key areas while improving overall conditions, Sichuan Province is actively carrying out the "five determinations" (定点, 定型, 定员, 定组, 定领导) for small coal mines: determining the location, model, personnel, groups, and leadership. Priority is given to mining areas with abundant resources, good coal quality, and convenient transportation and power supply for technological transformation. At the same time, general small coal mines are being consolidated and maintained to sustain production. While transforming small coal mines, corresponding development of simple washing and coking production is also being pursued to wash and coke coal locally, supplying the iron and steel industry.

Currently, the transformation of small coal mines is progressing rapidly. In Neijiang Prefecture, some mines have expanded underground working faces and improved ventilation, drainage, and hoisting conditions by using indigenous equipment such as wooden winnowers and winches. As a result, production capacity has increased by an average of more than double that of December last year. The Lijiagou Coal Mine in Yongchuan County was originally a small indigenous mine with a daily coal output of only about three tons. The mine workers independently manufactured indigenous machinery such as wooden winches, coal crushers, and coal sifters, and created a rapid air-blast coking method. This enabled the indigenous mechanization of key processes such as underground hoisting, transportation, coal crushing, and coking. Without any national investment, the annual raw coal production capacity reached over ten thousand tons, and several thousand tons of coke can also be produced each year.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th: Henan Province has achieved results in the technological transformation of small coal mines by relying on the masses to carry out technical revolution and self-manufacture equipment.

According to incomplete statistics from Xinxiang, Luoyang, Xuchang, and other prefectures, three hundred and fifty-eight small coal mines have basically achieved indigenous mechanization or semi-mechanization; more than four hundred others are currently undergoing transformation. The transformed small coal mines have not only saved a lot of manpower and reduced the physical labor of workers, but also greatly increased coal production. According to statistics from the Henan Provincial Coal Industry Bureau, the current average daily output of raw coal from small coal mines in the province is more than 20,000 tons, catching up with the production level of the province's coal industry in 1957.

In rectifying and transforming small coal mines, Henan Province has adopted the approach of focusing on transforming small coal mines located near "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" iron and steel bases, so that the coal needed by the iron and steel plants operated by prefectures and counties can be supplied locally.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 20th: Gansu Province is actively transforming small coal mines based on the principle of "overall transformation, focusing on key improvements."

Gansu Province opened more than two thousand three hundred small coal mines last year, with more than one hundred open-pit mining areas. The output of small coal mines accounts for more than half of the province's total output. This year, the greater leap forward in Gansu Province's coal industry mainly relies on these small coal mines.

The "overall transformation" of small coal mines in Gansu Province involves using indigenous methods and indigenous machinery to reform the tools of all small coal mines. "Focusing on key improvements" involves adopting indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods for key mines to gradually achieve indigenous mechanization or semi-mechanization, so that the transformed mines can generally produce for three to five years, with annual output increasing to more than 30,000 to 50,000 tons.

More than one hundred small coal mines have been selected for key transformation throughout the province.

Some small coal mines that have undergone tool reform have already shown initial results. For example, the Daijia No. 4 well in Dongshuiquan, Shandan County, previously had no drainage equipment, and sometimes only produced more than ten tons of coal per day. Recently, the workers manufactured two hand-operated water pumps, quickly eliminated the underground water inflow, and increased the daily coal production to one hundred and eighty tons. After the Xinhe Coal Mine installed two 40-kilowatt generators, the two production wells have been using electric pumps for drainage. Several hundred workers who originally used manual drainage have now participated in coal mining, thereby increasing coal production. (Attached picture)

　　Sichuan Yongchuan County Hongxin People’s Commune-run Lijiagou small coal mine has made achievements in technological transformation. The indigenous coal crusher they created can crush 32 tons of coal per day, which is 284 times more efficient than manual coal hammering.

### 改造小窑　增产“乌金”  四川河南甘肃小煤窑搞土机械化

    改造小窑　增产“乌金”
    四川河南甘肃小煤窑搞土机械化
    据新华社成都20日电　四川省有近百个县正在广泛改造小煤窑，提高煤炭产量。今年计划改造小煤窑七千个以上，并在小高炉群附近和交通沿线，重点改造每个年产能力在一万吨以上的小窑二千个。
    小煤窑是四川省煤炭工业迅速发展起来的一支重要生力军。去年从9月到12月的短短四个月中，四川省小煤窑从八千多个猛增到三万六千多个。去年，这些小煤窑共生产原煤一千八百多万吨，占全省原煤产量的70％以上。
    四川省各地根据钢铁工业的布局，本着重点改造、普遍提高的原则，正在积极进行小煤窑的定点、定型、定员、定组、定领导的“五定”工作，以资源丰富、煤质好、交通和电源比较方便的矿区作为重点，进行技术改造，同时对一般小煤窑加以整顿巩固，维持生产。在改造小煤窑的同时，要相应地发展简易洗选、炼焦生产，就地洗煤炼焦，供应钢铁工业。
    现在，小煤窑的改造工作进展很快。内江专区部分矿井在扩大井下工作面，利用木质风簸、绞车等土设备，改善通风、排水、提升条件后，生产能力平均比去年12月份提高了一倍以上。永川县李家沟煤矿原来是一个日产煤只有三吨左右的小土窑，矿上职工自己动手制造了木制绞车、碎煤机、筛煤机等土机械和创造了鼓风快速炼焦法，使井下提升、运输、碎煤、炼焦等主要环节实现了土机械化，没有用国家投资，原煤的年产能力就达到一万吨以上，每年还能生产焦炭数千吨。
    据新华社郑州20日电　河南省依靠群众大搞技术革命和自制设备，对小煤窑进行技术改造的工作已经做出成绩。
    据新乡、洛阳、许昌等专区的不完全统计，有三百五十八个小煤矿和小煤窑基本上实现了土机械化或半机械化；目前正在改造的还有四百多个。经过改造的小煤窑，不仅节省了许多人力和减轻了工人的体力劳动，而且煤炭产量大大提高。据河南省煤炭工业局统计，目前全省小煤窑平均日产原煤二万吨以上，赶上了1957年全省煤炭工业的生产水平。
    在整顿和改造小煤窑中，河南省采取了哪里有“小土群”和“小洋群”钢铁基地，就重点改造哪里的小煤窑，这样，使专区和县经营的钢铁厂所需要的煤炭，能够在当地得到供应。
    据新华社兰州20日电　甘肃省本着“全面改造、重点提高”的原则，正积极改造小煤窑。
    甘肃省去年开办了二千三百多个小煤窑，露天采区达一百多处。小煤窑的产量占全省产量一半以上。今年，甘肃省煤炭工业的更大跃进，主要还是依靠这些小煤窑。
    甘肃省对小煤窑的进行“全面改造”，就是用土办法、土机械对所有小煤窑进行工具改革。“重点提高”，就是对重点矿井采取土法上马、土洋结合的办法，逐步实现土机械化或半机械化，做到改造后的矿井一般能生产三、五年，年产量增加到三万到五万吨以上。
    全省已经选择了一百多个小煤窑进行重点改造。
    一些进行工具改革的小煤窑现在已初见成效。如山丹县东水泉戴家四号井，过去没有排水设备，有时一天只产煤十多吨；最近职工们制造了二台手压水泵，很快排除了井下涌水，日产煤增加到一百八十多吨。新河煤矿安装了两台四十瓩发电机后，两个生产井已经使用电泵排水，原来用手工排水的几百个工人都参加了采煤，因此提高了煤的产量。（附图片）
    四川永川县红新人民公社办的李家沟小煤窑，技术改造有成绩。他们创制的土碎煤机每天可碎煤三十二吨，较人工锤煤工效提高二百八十四倍。这是工人正在将打碎的煤运到一边。
