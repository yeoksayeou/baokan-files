    Cheer the 21st Congress of the CPSU
    Great Inspiration
    Comrade Editor:
    Hearing the news of the convening of the 21st Extraordinary Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the officers and soldiers of our team felt extremely excited. The newspapers carrying the news of the congress had just arrived, and comrades were eagerly vying to read them. In particular, Khrushchev's report greatly inspired us. The seven-year plan is a grand program for the Soviet people to march towards a communist society, and the realization of this plan will greatly strengthen the power of the entire socialist camp. The officers and soldiers of our 14th Detachment all expressed that they would go all out and strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, and at all times heighten our vigilance, strengthen Sino-Soviet unity, and ensure world peace.

    欢呼苏共二十一次代表大会
    巨大的鼓舞
    编辑同志：
    听到苏联共产党第二十一次非常代表大会召开的消息，我队广大官兵感到极大的兴奋。刊登大会消息的报纸刚刚来到，同志们就纷纷争阅。特别是赫鲁晓夫的报告，使我们受到很大鼓舞。七年计划是苏联人民向共产主义社会迈进的宏伟纲领，这个计划的实现将大大加强整个社会主义阵营的威力。我们十四支队的官兵们都表示要鼓足干劲，争取1959年更大更好更全面的跃进，并时刻提高警惕，加强中苏团结，确保世界和平。
