Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 25th -- The Executive Committee of the Cuban People's Socialist Party recently issued a statement supporting Castro's appointment as Prime Minister and the various revolutionary tasks he announced.

    According to a report in the "Hoy" newspaper on the 21st, the People's Socialist Party believes in its statement that Castro's appointment as Prime Minister is a victory for revolutionary and progressive forces and a step towards eliminating the gap between the provisional government and the revolutionary forces. This appointment will strengthen revolutionary action.

    The newspaper said that the People's Socialist Party fully supports the guarantees put forward by Castro regarding land reform, housing construction, the development of national industry, and worker welfare. At the same time, it fully supports Castro's warning to guard against the movements launched by enemies of Cuba, both domestic and foreign, aimed at splitting the revolutionary forces.

    The statement of the People's Socialist Party emphasizes the danger posed by the blackmail activities of US imperialism and its servants.

    The statement warns the Cuban people to be vigilant against counter-revolutionaries carrying out conspiracies and spreading rumors, and reiterates the urgent need for unity among revolutionary and patriotic forces.

    The statement of the People's Socialist Party points out that the enemies of the revolution rely on the old reactionary tactics of alienating the people's forces. It says that the weapon the enemy likes to use is anti-communism. The statement of the People's Socialist Party says that whoever promotes, advances, or tolerates anti-communist practices is helping the cause of imperialism and counter-revolution. The statement also says that whoever attacks or undermines unity is endangering the revolution and creating obstacles to the complete realization of revolutionary goals.

    古巴人民社会党发表声明
    支持政府的革命措施
    新华社25日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴人民社会党执行委员会最近发表声明，支持卡斯特罗就任总理和他所宣布的各项革命任务。
    据“今日报”21日报道，人民社会党在声明中认为，卡斯特罗的被任命为总理，是革命势力和进步势力的胜利，是消除临时政府和革命势力之间的隔阂的一个步骤。这个任命将加强革命行动。
    这家报纸说，人民社会党完全支持卡斯特罗在土地改革、兴建住房、发展国家工业和工人福利方面所提出的保证，同时全力支持卡斯特罗发出的提防古巴国内外敌人发动旨在分裂革命力量的运动的警告。
    人民社会党的声明强调美帝国主义及其仆从进行讹诈活动所产生的危险。
    声明告诫古巴人民提防反革命分子进行阴谋活动和散播谣言，并重申革命势力和爱国势力迫切需要团结一致。
    人民社会党的声明指出，革命的敌人依靠离间人民势力那种老一套反动策略。它说，敌人喜欢采用的武器便是反对共产主义。人民社会党的声明说，谁宣传、推进或容忍反共做法，谁便是在帮助帝国主义和反革命的勾当。声明又说，谁攻击团结或破坏团结，谁就是危害革命，并且制造阻挠革命目标完全实现的障碍。
