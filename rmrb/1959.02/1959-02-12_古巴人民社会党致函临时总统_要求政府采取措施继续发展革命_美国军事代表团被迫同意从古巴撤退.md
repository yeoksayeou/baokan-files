Xinhua News Agency, February 11th, dispatch from New York by TASS: According to the Cuban newspaper "Hoy," the National Committee of the People's Socialist Party of Cuba held an expanded meeting in Havana from January 26th to 28th. The meeting studied the issues of defending the revolution and ensuring its continued development, the party's work under legal conditions, and many other issues.

The Chairman of the People's Socialist Party of Cuba, Juan Marinello, delivered the opening speech at the meeting. The General Secretary of the Party, Blas Roca, delivered a speech on behalf of the Executive Committee of the National Committee on the issue of defending the achievements of the revolution.

The plenary session unanimously passed a letter to the Provisional President of Cuba. The letter listed the urgent demands of the masses of people, supported by the People's Socialist Party, for the continued development of the revolution. Among these demands were: the immediate implementation of land reform, the issuance of a declaration to eliminate racial discrimination, the implementation of trade union democratization, and the raising of workers' wages and relief for unemployed workers.

In the letter, the People's Socialist Party of Cuba also suggested abolishing all the privileges granted to foreign companies by the former government that placed excessive burdens on Cuba, proposing the promulgation of laws to establish armed forces on the basis of the rebel army, and the formulation of laws to democratize the 1940 Constitution.

The plenary session also suggested that the government issue a declaration stipulating that the government will pursue a policy of non-alignment with any bloc, stipulating that the government will establish diplomatic and trade relations with all countries in the world—including socialist countries—on the basis of conforming to the interests of the Cuban people and mutual respect for sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, and respect for the social and political systems of other countries.

The plenary session also passed a letter from the People's Socialist Party of Cuba to the Cuban people.

Xinhua News Agency, February 11th, dispatch from Havana: The Cuban Provisional Government's Ministry of State announced on the 10th that the United States had "agreed" to withdraw its American military delegation from Cuba.

This military delegation was composed of thirty-one American army, navy, and air force "officers" and "experts." During the Batista dictatorship, this notoriously evil American military delegation not only trained Batista's army but also directly commanded the reactionary government's troops to suppress the Cuban national uprising movement. The news stated that, so far, the American ambassador in Havana has "refused to make any comment" on the withdrawal of the military delegation.

The Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Armed Forces, Castro, after the establishment of the new government, repeatedly condemned the American military delegation as "a mission trained to defeat our army and possibly engage in espionage," stating that "revolutionary Cuba no longer needs the help of the American military delegation" and demanded that it "pack up and leave as soon as possible."

Xinhua News Agency, February 11th, dispatch from Havana: Employees of the Cuban Electric Company, controlled by American monopoly capital, recently achieved victory in their struggle against the employer's unreasonable dismissal of workers. The Cuban Electric Company is an electrical monopoly organization of American Foreign Power Company in Cuba, and its power lines extend to every factory, store, and home in Cuba that uses electricity.

According to reports, more than six hundred employees of the Cuban Electric Company held hunger strikes and demonstrations in the capital Havana earlier this month. They protested against the employer's unreasonable dismissal of employees who participated in political activities and trade union work, and demanded a 20% wage increase.

The news stated that, due to the persistence of the Cuban workers in this struggle, the "directors" of the Cuban Electric Company were forced on the 9th to "agree to continue employing those workers who were dismissed for participating in political and trade union activities" and to "pay them all wages for the entire period of dismissal."

Prior to this, this American company had threatened the Cuban government, "demanding 'urgent attention and resolution' to strikes affecting its operations nationwide," otherwise, it "would lead to the 'final paralysis' of operations."

    古巴人民社会党致函临时总统
    要求政府采取措施继续发展革命
    美国军事代表团被迫同意从古巴撤退
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社纽约10日讯：据古巴报纸“今日报”报道，古巴人民社会党全国委员会从上月26日到28日在哈瓦那举行了扩大会议。会议研究了保卫革命和保证革命的继续发展问题、党在合法条件下的工作问题以及其它许多问题。
    古巴人民社会党主席胡安·马里内略在会上致了开幕词。党的总书记布拉斯·罗加代表全国委员会执行委员会对保卫革命成果的问题作了发言。
    全会一致通过了一封给古巴临时总统的信。信中列举了受到人民社会党支持的人民群众对继续发展革命的迫切要求。在这些要求中有：立即实行土地改革，发布消灭种族歧视的声明，实行工会民主化以及提高工人工资和救济失业工人。
    古巴人民社会党在信中还建议取缔前政府给予外国公司的一切使古巴负担过重的特权，建议颁发在起义军部队的基础上建立武装力量的法律和制订使1940年宪法民主化的法律。
    全会还建议政府发表一项宣言，规定政府将执行不参加任何集团的政策，规定政府在符合古巴人民利益和相互尊重主权、互不干涉内政、尊重其他国家的社会政治制度的基础上，与世界上的一切国家——其中包括社会主义国家——建立外交与贸易关系。
    全会还通过了古巴人民社会党告古巴人民书。
    新华社11日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴临时政府国务部10日宣布，美国已经“同意”撤退它在古巴的美国军事代表团。
    这个军事代表团是由三十一名美国海陆空军的“军官”和“专家”组成的。在巴蒂斯塔独裁统治时期，这个恶行昭著的美国军事代表团不但训练过巴蒂斯塔的军队，而且直接指挥反动政府军队来镇压古巴民族起义运动。消息说，到目前为止，在哈瓦那的美国大使对军事代表团的撤退始终“拒绝发表任何评论”。
    古巴武装部队总司令卡斯特罗在新政府成立以后曾经多次谴责美国军事代表团是“一个训练用来打败我们的军队的和可能进行间谍活动的使团”，“革命的古巴不再需要美国军事代表团的帮助”，并且要求它“卷铺盖，尽快离开”。
    新华社11日讯　哈瓦那消息：美国垄断资本控制的古巴电力公司的职工，最近在反对资方无理解雇工人的斗争中取得了胜利。古巴电力公司是美国国内外电力公司在古巴的电气垄断组织，它的电力线路伸展到古巴使用电力的每一家工厂、商店和住家。
    据报道，古巴电力公司六百多名职工本月初在首都哈瓦那举行了绝食罢工和示威游行。他们抗议资方无理解雇参加政治活动和工会工作的职工，并且要求增加工资20％。
    消息说，由于古巴工人坚持了这个斗争，古巴电力公司的“董事”已在9日被迫“同意继续雇用那些因参加政治和工会活动而被解雇的工人”，并且“照付他们解雇期间的全部工资”。
    在这以前，这家美国公司曾经威胁古巴政府，“要求对影响它在全国的业务的怠工‘给予紧急的注意和设法解决’”，否则“将导致业务的‘最后瘫痪’。”
