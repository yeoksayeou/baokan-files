    A Paradise for Beasts, a Hell for Humans
    Chí Běi'ǒu
    Mrs.'s cats, Miss's dogs, Master's horses, Young Master's monkeys...
    Their nails manicured, their heads shaved, perfumed, and hair oiled.
    One by one they arrive at luxurious mansions, where lavish banquets await them.
    The halls are brightly lit, like daytime.
    The tables are laden with delicacies and fine wines:
    South African fruits, Australian steaks, Kenyan coffee, New Zealand cream…
    Who can say that this old-brand empire is not wealthy?
    Beasts eat even better than humans.
    While laborers tighten their belts, the wealthy's cats and dogs eat meat and drink milk at every meal.
    Animals receive love and respect, while human dignity suffers insult and damage.
    A paradise for beasts, a hell for humans, that is the essence of the "free world." (Attached picture)
    While hundreds of thousands of unemployed people in Britain wander the streets in the harsh winter, searching for bread and jobs, the wealthy in Britain held a beast feast in a luxurious London hotel on February 10, indulging in wild revelry. Various kinds of beasts attended this banquet, from monkeys, cats, dogs, ducks, to horses, deer, and even large snakes.

    畜生的天堂，人的地狱
    池北偶太太的猫、小姐的狗，老爷的马、少爷的猴，……修过指甲，剃过了头，喷了香水，上了发油。一位一位莅临豪华的大厦，那里设好了盛宴在恭候。大厅里灯火辉煌明如白昼，餐桌上摆满佳肴美酒：南非的水果，澳洲的肉排，怯尼亚的咖啡，新西兰的奶油……谁能说这老牌帝国不富有？畜生吃的比人还要讲究。劳动者要勒紧裤带，富豪的猫狗顿顿吃肉喝奶，禽兽得到宠爱和尊敬，人的尊严受尽侮辱和损害。畜生的天堂，人的地狱，这就是“自由世界”的实质所在。（附图片）
    当英国数十万的失业者在严冬中徘徊街头寻找面包、寻找职业的时候，英国的富有者却于2月10日在伦敦豪华的大旅馆中，举行禽兽宴，纵情狂欢。参加这个宴会的有各种各样的禽兽，从猴子、猫、狗、鸭到马、鹿甚至大蛇。
