The Overproduction Crisis Deepens Contradictions in Capitalist Countries
Western European Coal and Steel Community Shows Signs of Disintegration
Coal Stocks Pile Up in Various Countries
All Take Measures to Protect Themselves

(Reported by this newspaper) As the overproduction crisis in Western European coal and steel intensifies, contradictions within the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) group are becoming increasingly acute.

According to the French newspaper "Le Monde" on February 18th, the coal crisis in Western Europe is deepening further, with coal stocks piling up at mine sites in all Western European countries. The British coal industry has decided to close 36 mines. The West German coal industry is attempting to overcome difficulties by partially laying off miners. France, due to the large accumulation of coal stocks, has begun to limit production. Belgium has decided to continue closing a number of coal mines. The newspaper estimates that in the next month, the six ECSC countries will have 55 million tons of coal stockpiled at mine sites and in the hands of consumers, equivalent to eleven weeks of production.

In order to cope with this situation, the ECSC Council of Ministers recently held a meeting in Luxembourg to discuss countermeasures. After the meeting, Belgian Minister of Economic Affairs, Mr. Siven, told the press that if the ECSC could not help Belgium solve the difficulties in its coal mining industry, Belgium would take measures to implement self-help. So-called "self-help" would mean prohibiting coal from Germany, the Netherlands, and France from entering Belgium, which would mean the disintegration of the ECSC.

Since joining the "Coal and Steel Common Market," Belgium has not benefited from the alliance because its coal mining industry, after lowering tariffs, cannot compete with West Germany and the Netherlands. For several years, the ECSC has painstakingly resolved this contradiction by subsidizing the Belgian coal industry through taxes levied on West German and Dutch coal owners, preventing Belgium from withdrawing from the alliance. However, now that the coal mining industries in all Western European countries are struggling to take care of themselves, it is no longer possible for Belgium to obtain these subsidies. Conversely, with the market shrinking and competition intensifying, the Belgian coal mining industry has been particularly severely hit.

The French newspaper "Libération," in commenting on this matter, pointed out: "Just as the Common Market is opening, the first institution established by the six small European countries—the European Coal and Steel Community—is showing signs of disintegration."

France Underprices Steel Sales
Other Western European Countries Dissatisfied

(Reported by this newspaper) The fact that French steel prices in the Western European market have consistently been lower than those of other countries since the devaluation of the French franc has caused serious unease among the ECSC countries, particularly West Germany.

On February 11th, representatives of the ECSC's highest authority met with the French Minister of Industry and Commerce, Mr. Marcel-Jean Jeanneny, in Paris to discuss the issue of steel prices. At the meeting, the West German representative pointed out that since the devaluation of the French franc by 17% at the end of last year, some French steel products have had factory prices that were 30% lower than West German steel prices. He demanded that this artificial and abnormal phenomenon be changed. However, Mr. Jeanneny flatly denied this claim. He said that after deducting freight and taxes, the price of French steel delivered to the Ruhr region of West Germany was at most 5% lower than the German steel price, and would not exceed this limit.

After several compromises, the representatives of the ECSC's highest authority finally requested that the French government either find a way to significantly increase steel prices or levy a compensatory tax on French steel enterprises to change this "unreasonable" situation. However, both of these suggestions were rejected by the French side.

West Germany Raises Coal Import Tax
United States Greatly Angered by Impact

(Reported by this newspaper) In order to alleviate the coal overproduction crisis, the West German government has announced that it will increase the import tax on coal by $4.76 per ton, effective February 16th. Currently, 14 million tons of coal and coke cannot be sold in the Ruhr region.

This measure by the West German government has aroused strong dissatisfaction among American coal monopoly capitalists. United States Congressman Bailey, representing the "Anthracite Operators Association," telegraphed the United States Department of State, saying that after West Germany increased the import tax on coal, at least 14 million tons of the 16 million tons of anthracite coal that the United States exports to West Germany each year would be squeezed out of the market, which would increase the number of unemployed in the American coal-producing center of West Virginia by 7,000 to 9,000. Mr. Bailey believes that this action by West Germany is the first blow to the United States by Western European countries through the Western European "Common Market."

He said that this is a "blackmail" weapon that European countries may use to force the United States to further reduce tariffs. Mr. Pickett, Vice President of the United States "National Coal Association," also wrote a letter to the United States Department of State, saying that since 1948, the United States has provided West Germany with more than $13 billion in aid, part of which was used to help West Germany rebuild its coal industry, but now "the hand that fed West Germany has been bitten." He demanded that the United States Department of State lodge a formal protest, and if West Germany does not cancel this measure, the United States should take economic retaliation.

The United States government has lodged a protest with West Germany over this matter. In a note to the West German government, the United States government emphasized that West Germany's increase in the import tax on coal would have a "serious impact" on those coal mines that produce specifically for the needs of the West German market. However, the West German government did not concede, and in a note responding to the American protest, stated its firm intention to implement the measure of increasing the import tax on coal, and reiterated the "necessity of giving the German coal mining industry a breathing space."

### 生产过剩危机加深资本主义国家矛盾  西欧煤钢联营有瓦解之势

    生产过剩危机加深资本主义国家矛盾
    西欧煤钢联营有瓦解之势
    各国存煤堆积如山
    纷纷采取措施自保
    本报讯　在西欧煤钢生产过剩危机愈演愈烈的情况下，欧洲煤钢联营集团内部的矛盾日趋尖锐化。
    据法国“世界报”本月18日称，西欧煤业危机正进一步加深，所有西欧各国煤矿矿场上的存煤都堆积如山。英国煤业决定关闭三十六个矿山。西德煤业企图借助于矿工部分失业来度过难关。法国因存煤大量堆积，已开始限制生产。比利时决定继续关闭一批煤矿。据该报估计，下一个月，煤钢联营集团六国积存在煤矿矿场上和消费者手里的煤将达五千五百万吨，即相当于十一个星期的产量。
    为了应付这一情况，欧洲煤钢联营集团部长理事会最近在卢森堡举行会议，商讨对策。会后，比利时经济大臣西文告诉报界说，如果欧洲煤钢联营集团不能帮助比利时解决煤矿业的困难，比利时就将采取措施来实行自助。所谓“自助”，就是要禁止德国、荷兰和法国的煤入境，而这就意味着煤钢联营的瓦解。
    比利时自从参加“煤钢共同市场”以来，由于它的采煤业在降低关税后，不能同西德和荷兰竞争，因此，并未得到联营的好处。几年来，欧洲煤钢联营集团一直煞费苦心地用向西德和荷兰煤业主征收税来津贴比利时煤业的办法，解决这个矛盾，使比利时不致退出联营。但是目前当西欧所有国家的采煤业都自顾不暇的时候，比利时要想再取得这笔津贴已不可能。相反地，在市场日益萎缩，竞争更趋激烈下，比利时采煤业遭到的打击特别严重。
    法国“解放报”在评述这件事时指出：“正当共同市场开张之际，小欧洲六国最先建立的机构——欧洲煤钢联营集团都有了瓦解之势”。
    法国压价推销钢材
    西欧其他国家不满
    本报讯　法郎贬值后，法国钢价在西欧市场上一直低于其他国家的情况，引起了欧洲煤钢联营国家特别是西德的严重不安。
    本月11日，煤钢联营集团最高机构的代表在巴黎同法国工商部长马塞尔·让内讨论了钢的价格问题。会上西德代表指出，自从去年年底法郎贬值17％以后，结果法国的一些钢材出厂价格低于西德钢价30％。他要求改变这种人为的不正常现象。但是，让内断然否认这一说法。他说，除掉运费和课税后，法国在西德鲁尔区交货的钢材价格最多也只比德国钢价低5％，而不会超过这个限度。
    经过几度折衷之后，煤钢联营集团最高机构的代表终于要求法国政府或者设法大大提高钢价，或者向法国钢铁企业课一种补偿税，以改变这种“不合理”的情况。但是这两项建议都遭到法国方面的拒绝。
    西德提高煤的进口税
    美国受影响大为光火
    本报讯　西德政府为了缓和煤的生产过剩危机，已宣布从2月16日起将煤的进口税每吨增加四点七六美元。目前在鲁尔区销不出去的煤和焦炭已达一千四百万吨。
    西德政府的这项措施引起美国煤业垄断资本的强烈不满，美国国会议员贝利代表“烟煤经营者协会”打电报给美国国务院说，西德提高煤的进口税后，美国每年向西德出口的一千六百万吨烟煤中，至少将有一千四百万吨要被排挤出市场，这样将使美国产煤中心西弗吉尼亚州增加七千至九千失业者。贝利认为，西德这次行动是西欧国家通过西欧“共同市场”给美国第一个打击。
    他说，这是一种“讹诈”武器，欧洲国家可能用它来迫使美国进一步降低关税。美国“全国煤矿协会”副主席皮克特也给美国国务院写了一封信说，从1948年起，美国对西德提供了一百三十多亿美元的援助，其中一部分用于帮助西德重建煤炭工业，但是现在“喂西德的手却被咬了一口”。他要求美国国务院提出正式抗议，如果西德不取消这项措施，美国就应采取经济报复。
    美国政府为此向西德提出了抗议。在致西德政府的照会中美国政府强调说，西德提高煤的进口税将对那些专为西德市场需要而生产的煤矿产生“严重影响”。但是西德政府并不让步，在回答美国抗议的照会中表示坚决要执行增加煤的进口税的措施，并再次强调这项措施“给予德国采煤工业以喘息机会的必要性”。
