Editorial: Basic Construction Should Comprehensively Implement the Policy of More, Faster, Better, and More Economical

    In 1958, China achieved brilliant accomplishments on the basic construction front. The national investment in basic construction this year was about half of the total investment during the First Five-Year Plan period. There were more than 600 large factories and mines above the quota that were partially or fully put into production, more than 160 more than during the First Five-Year Plan period. On average, a new factory or mine above the quota was partially or fully put into production every twelve-plus hours. Small and medium-sized factories and mines sprang up like mushrooms all over the motherland. The scale and speed of basic construction were unprecedented; engineering costs were generally reduced, and the quality of projects generally met the requirements.
    Larger-scale basic construction work has already begun in 1959. The characteristics of this year's basic construction work are: large tasks and many large and complex projects. Although our design and construction teams have been greatly trained and improved last year, and have made unprecedented achievements, compared with the increasingly large-scale and complex construction tasks, our experience is still insufficient, and our technical level is still not high. Therefore, in the face of this year's great basic construction tasks, we must not be complacent in the slightest, but should continue to exert full effort, further comprehensively implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, and strive to ensure that the quantity and quality of basic construction projects both leap forward, and achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.
    The goal of a comprehensive great leap forward in basic construction is to complete a large number of projects that are of high quality and low cost as quickly as possible. In basic construction work, at any time, we must strive to complete more projects as quickly as possible according to needs and possibilities. This can more quickly improve China's industrial level, enhance our national strength, and improve people's lives. The issue of speed is still a matter of paramount importance in socialist construction. However, while completing quantity as quickly as possible, we must pay attention to ensuring and improving quality. Because only good engineering quality can fully exert the investment effect, increase social products quickly and in large quantities, and achieve the goal of developing production at high speed. The superiority of socialism should not only be reflected in the quantity and progress of economic achievements, but also in its quality. Both production and basic construction need to pay attention to quality, and basic construction is a project of vital and lasting importance, so we must ensure quality.
    There is a contradictory side between quantity, speed, and quality, but there is also a unified side. Some people say that "high output cannot be high quality" and "to improve quality, the progress cannot be guaranteed," etc. These are all one-sided views that only see the contradictory side between quantity, speed, and quality and do not see their unified side. Countless examples in the great leap forward in basic construction have powerfully broken this incorrect argument. For example, the large container workshop factory building project of the Jilin Chemical Machinery Factory, according to general construction conditions, would take at least half a year to complete at the fastest. However, the construction unit of this project completed the entire project in thirty-five working days under severe winter construction conditions, and the quality was good. Of course, sometimes some units did not unify quality and quantity, and there have been individual cases in the past where speed was guaranteed but quality was not. What is the reason? The main reason is that the relationship between quantity, speed, and quality was not correctly treated, and the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical was not fully implemented.
    The policy of socialist construction of more, faster, better, and more economical put forward by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong is a dialectically unified and complete policy. The four aspects of more, faster, better, and more economical are mutually restrictive and mutually reinforcing. Ignoring any one aspect will lead to bad results. The four requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical are relative, and no one aspect can be unilaterally emphasized. For example, unilaterally emphasizing good (quality) and inappropriately increasing the safety factor in the design will cause waste and affect the scale and speed of construction. However, conversely, if we unilaterally seek more and faster, and the design and construction are very sloppy; or if we unilaterally seek to save money, and inappropriately save raw materials or use unqualified materials instead, the result will affect the quality of the project, and even cause accidents. In the end, it will still cause waste and fail to speed up the construction. In the process of implementing the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, we must break superstitions, liberate our minds, and advocate daring to think, speak, and act, and at the same time, we must be realistic, advocate practical calculations, arrangements, and inspections, and combine soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis.
    Based on the experience gained in basic construction in 1958, how can we further comprehensively implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical in the main links of design, construction, and building materials to achieve a comprehensive leap forward in quantity and quality?
    Design work is the first important checkpoint in basic construction. Design work has a decisive impact on the quality and rationality of factory and mine projects. In 1958, the national survey and design personnel exerted the spirit of daring to think, speak, and act, and adopted measures such as combining indigenous and foreign methods, using local materials, and lowering excessively high standards, which greatly saved investment. For example, for large-scale iron and steel joint enterprises, the construction investment required to increase the production capacity of one ton of steel per year was 750 yuan to 1,000 yuan during the First Five-Year Plan period, but last year it was only 300 yuan. Many units have improved the efficiency of design work after reforming design methods, and have basically reversed the situation in which design could not keep up with construction. This year, we must continue to oppose the conservative tendency of sticking to conventions in design work and carry forward the spirit of creation. Without this spirit, design work cannot leap forward. However, we must also pay attention to combining creativity with the spirit of seeking truth from facts. For example, in the design of building structures, we must at all times oppose the conservative tendency of inappropriately raising structural standards, in order to save funds and build more enterprises. At the same time, we should also pay attention to not inappropriately reducing the structural quality, for example, major engineering projects that should use steel structures should use steel structures, and should not use reinforced concrete structures; those that should use reinforced concrete structures should use reinforced concrete structures, and should not use brick and wood structures; and the walls of civil buildings should be as thick as they should be. This is not conservatism, nor is it waste, but it is seeking truth from facts, that is, using a scientific attitude to act in accordance with the requirements of the objective laws of things. Liberating the mind and breaking superstitions are aimed at protecting science; superstition must be broken, and science must be established. Therefore, it is necessary to advocate carrying out practical experiments and calculations in the design. It is necessary to reasonably apply the design, and the shortcomings of excessively slow design should not be repeated; however, the practice of simply seeking speed, unilaterally saving money, and not paying attention to quality is also incorrect. Sometimes, certain repetitive construction and relatively minor projects can be surveyed, designed, and constructed at the same time, but in general, large and medium-sized projects must follow the normal basic construction procedure of "no survey, no design, no design, no construction." In the design, it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, which is an important measure to ensure that basic construction is more, faster, better, and more economical. To better implement this policy, we first need to have a correct understanding of it. The characteristics of the design of combining indigenous and foreign methods are two: First, based on China's specific circumstances, refer to foreign experience and conduct creative design; Second, in the process design of most enterprises, appropriately use simple equipment with a low degree of mechanization to meet the needs of China's great leap forward in the national economy. However, it cannot be considered that the combination of indigenous and foreign methods is "the more indigenous, the better," and buildings that should use steel structures are also changed to brick and wood structures. This violates science, and the result will affect the quality of the project, and even cause accidents. Design personnel need to correctly grasp the spirit of the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, so that design work can achieve a more comprehensive leap forward.
    Another link to ensure a comprehensive leap forward in the quantity and quality of basic construction is construction. In 1958, the construction department reformed the labor organization and operation methods of the construction team, and carried out a mass technical revolution movement, which greatly accelerated the construction and installation speed. It used to take more than two months to install a 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator unit, but now it only takes 100 hours. The project cost of many units has been reduced by 20% to 30%. The quality of the project is generally good as well. This new construction method is a reasonable construction method that is more, faster, better, and more economical, and should be promoted step by step this year. In the promotion, it is also necessary to correctly and comprehensively grasp the main content of this new construction method. That is: (1) Rationally arrange the engineering projects, shorten the front line, and concentrate superior forces to fight annihilation battles. Complete a batch and then build a batch, complete one and then come to another. (2) On a factory building or building, change the specialized work teams that were divided into very fine jobs in the past to mixed work teams, launch a multi-skilled movement among the workers and masses, and implement a layered, cross-parallel assembly line operation construction method on a project. (3) Greatly increase the proportion of prefabricated components and assembly work. (4) On the construction site, the various types of work, the A and B parties, etc., implement unified centralized leadership. It can be seen from this that the main efforts in the construction aspect of basic construction in 1959 are to shorten the front line, concentrate forces, unify leadership, reform labor organization, and improve construction technology, and the results are concentratedly manifested in the acceleration of construction speed. Therefore, it is necessary to comprehensively summarize and promote the experience of the great leap forward in construction last year, which is centered on the above-mentioned basic content, and improve the management level and technical level of construction in order to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical. Any practice of unilaterally pursuing speed without in-depth and meticulous work will not only fail to achieve the purpose of speed, but also cause losses in work. Construction must be prepared, and of course the preparation time should not be too long. General projects should have construction plans, and larger projects should have construction organization designs. If the preparation work is done well, construction will not only be slow, but will be faster. In construction, it is sometimes necessary to modify some design drawings. Some modifications are necessary to correct design errors and unreasonable points. However, any important part of the design that affects the structure of the project needs to be modified with the consent of the design department. Changing building materials should also go through practical calculations and certain approval procedures. In short, be bold and careful, accelerate the construction speed, pay attention to economy, and ensure the quality of the project. The leaders of the construction department should also comprehensively grasp ideology, grasp production, and grasp life. The greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more we should care about the lives of the masses, ensure that construction workers, especially high-altitude workers, have enough rest time, and ensure the safe production of workers.
    To improve the quality of the project, we must pay great attention to ensuring the quality of building materials. Whether it is metal materials such as steel, or non-metal materials such as cement, bricks, tiles, sand and gravel, we must responsibly check the product quality before leaving the factory, and only qualified products can leave the factory. In terms of material use, poor quality materials cannot be used in important parts of basic construction projects. In the selection of materials in the design, we must continue to oppose the conservative tendency, but also have the necessary safety factor. The construction department cannot tap the potential within the necessary safety factor of the design. New materials and qualified substitute materials should be adopted, but they should be tested and verified to prove that they are indeed qualified before they are widely promoted.
    In improving the quality of the project, special attention should be paid to large and medium-sized dam projects. These projects are related to the safety of people's lives, and there can be no sloppiness in any aspect of design, construction, and materials.
    To complete this year's basic construction tasks in a more, faster, better, and more economical manner, and to ensure a comprehensive leap forward in the quantity and quality of basic construction, the key lies in strengthening the Party's leadership and launching a mass movement. The provincial, municipal, and autonomous region party committees need to further strengthen the leadership of basic construction work, especially design work. Under the unified leadership of the Party, all design and construction units should implement the three-way combination of administrative personnel, technical personnel, and workers, fully mobilize everyone, and make the mass movement even more prosperous. At present, it is necessary to carry out mass movements to improve engineering quality, safety education, and improve technology, so that the idea of comprehensively implementing the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the technical level of workers is generally improved. In the current mass movement, we must also mobilize the vast number of employees to establish and improve some necessary technical management systems. The purpose of reforming rules and regulations is to do a good job in production and develop productive forces. Unreasonable rules and regulations must be abolished; necessary and reasonable rules and regulations need to be established and improved. For example, there should be necessary approval systems in design work, there should be various systems to ensure engineering quality and safe operation in construction, there should be certain inspection systems for the use of materials, and so on. At the same time, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to participate in management, strengthen the work of organizational management and technical management, and make the mass movement and centralized leadership well combined.
    The prelude to the great leap forward in basic construction in 1959 has been unveiled. As long as we strengthen the Party's leadership, launch a mass movement, and further comprehensively implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, we will be able to successfully complete this year's magnificent tasks and make the quantity and quality of basic construction leap forward!

### 基本建设要全面贯彻多快好省的方针

    基本建设要全面贯彻多快好省的方针
    1958年，我国在基本建设战线上取得了辉煌成就。这一年全国基本建设投资约为第一个五年计划期间投资总额的一半。仅限额以上的大厂矿，部分或全部投入生产的就有六百多个，比第一个五年计划期间多一百六十多个。平均每十二个多小时，就有一个限额以上的新建厂矿部分或全部投入生产。中小型厂矿更是雨后春笋般地出现在祖国大地上。基本建设规模之大，速度之快，都是空前的；工程造价普遍降低，工程质量一般都合乎要求。
    1959年更大规模的基本建设工作，已经开始了。今年基本建设工作的特点是：任务大，大型复杂的工程项目多。我国的设计和施工队伍去年虽然得到了很大的锻炼和提高，做出了空前巨大的成绩，但是比起规模越来越大、内容越来越复杂的建设任务来，我们的经验还是不够的，我们的技术水平还是不高的。因此，在今年伟大的基本建设任务面前，绝不能有丝毫自满，而应该继续鼓足干劲，进一步全面贯彻多快好省的方针，力保基本建设工程数量、质量双跳龙门，实现更大更好更全面的跃进。
    基本建设全面大跃进的目标，就是要尽快地完成数量众多、质量优良、成本低廉的工程。在基本建设工作中，任何时候都要根据需要和可能，力求尽快地完成更多的工程项目。这样可以更快地提高我国的工业水平，增强我们的国力，改善人民的生活。速度问题仍然是社会主义建设中具有头等重要性的问题。但是，在尽快地完成数量的同时，又必须注意保证和提高质量。因为只有好的工程质量，才能充分发挥投资效果，又快又多地增加社会产品，达到高速度地发展生产的目的。社会主义的优越性，不但要表现在经济成就的数量和进度上面，还必须表现在它的质量上面。生产和基本建设都需要注意质量，基本建设是百年大计，更要切实保证质量。
    数量、速度和质量之间有其矛盾的一面，但也有统一的一面。有人说“高产就不能优质”、“要提高质量就不能保证进度”等等，这都是只看到数量、速度和质量之间的矛盾的一面而没有看到它们统一的一面的片面看法。基本建设大跃进中无数的事例，有力地打破了这种不正确的论点。例如吉林化工机械厂庞大的容器车间厂房工程，按照一般施工情况，最快也得半年才能建成。但是，这项工程的施工单位在严寒的冬季施工条件下，用三十五个工作日就把全部工程建成了，而且质量良好。当然，有时候有的单位也的确没有把质量和数量统一起来，过去也出现过保证了速度但没有保证质量的个别事例。其原因何在呢？主要原因是没有正确对待数量、速度和质量的关系，没有全面贯彻多快好省的方针。
    党中央和毛泽东同志提出的多快好省的社会主义建设的方针，是一个辩证统一的完整的方针。多快好省这四个方面是互相制约又互相促进的。忽视其中任何一个方面都会造成不好的结果。多、快、好、省这四个要求是相对的，不能片面强调任何一个方面。例如，片面强调好（质量），在设计中不适当地加大安全系数，便会造成浪费，影响建设的规模和速度。但是，反过来，如果片面地贪多图快，设计、施工十分草率；或者是片面求省，不适当地节省原料或者用不合格的材料代替，结果都会影响工程质量，甚至发生事故。到头来，还是造成浪费，不能加快建设的速度。在贯彻多快好省方针的过程中，必须破除迷信，解放思想，提倡敢想敢说敢干，同时也要作到实事求是，提倡切实的计算、安排和检查，把冲天的干劲和科学分析结合起来。
    根据1958年在基本建设中取得的经验，我们在设计、施工和建筑材料这几个主要环节上，怎样进一步全面贯彻多快好省的方针使数量质量全面跃进呢？
    设计工作是基本建设的第一个重要关口。设计工作对于厂矿工程的质量好坏、合理与否有着决定性的影响。全国勘察设计人员在1958年发挥了敢想敢说敢干的精神，采取了土洋结合、就地取材、降低过高的标准等措施，大大节省了投资。例如，大型钢铁联合企业每增加年产一吨钢的生产能力，它的建设投资在第一个五年计划期间需要七百五十元至一千元，去年只要三百元。许多单位在改革设计方法以后，提高了设计工作的效率，基本上扭转了设计赶不上施工的局面。今年还要继续在设计工作中反对墨守成规的保守倾向，发扬创造精神。没有这种精神，设计工作就不能跃进。但是，也要注意把创造性和实事求是的精神结合起来。例如，在建筑结构的设计方面，任何时候都要反对不适当地提高结构标准的保守倾向，以便节省资金，兴建更多的企业。同时，也应该注意不要不适当地降低结构质量，比如，应该用钢结构的重大工程项目，就要用钢结构，而不要用钢筋混凝土的结构；应该用钢筋混凝土结构的，就要用钢筋混凝土结构，而不要用砖木结构；民用建筑的墙应当砌多厚，就要砌多厚。这不是保守，也不是浪费，而是实事求是，即用科学的态度按照事物的客观规律的要求办事。解放思想，破除迷信，目的是为了保护科学，是迷信必破，是科学必立。因此，需要提倡在设计中进行切实的试验、计算。合理地套用设计是必要的，设计过分缓慢的缺点也不应重复；但是，单纯图快、片面节约、不注意质量的作法也是不对的。有的时候，某些重复建设的、比较次要的工程可以边勘察、边设计、边施工，但是一般地说，大中型工程都必须遵循“没有勘察不能设计，没有设计不能施工”这一正常的基本建设程序。在设计中，需要继续贯彻土洋结合的方针，这是保证基本建设多快好省的一项重要措施。要很好地贯彻这一方针，首先需要对它有一个正确的理解。土洋结合的设计的特点有二：一是根据我国的具体情况，参考外国的经验，进行创造性的设计；二是在多数企业的工艺设计中，适当地采用机械化程度不高的简易的设备，以适应我国国民经济大跃进的需要。但是，不能认为土洋结合就是“越土越好”，应该采用钢结构的建筑也改用砖木结构。这就违反了科学，结果会影响工程质量，甚至造成事故。设计人员需要正确地掌握土洋结合的方针的精神，使设计工作实现更全面的跃进。
    保证基本建设数量质量全面跃进的另一个环节是施工。1958年，施工部门改革了建筑队伍的劳动组织和作业方法，开展了群众性的技术革命运动，建筑、安装速度大大加快。安装一台二万五千瓩汽轮发电机组，过去要两个多月，现在只要一百个小时。许多单位的工程成本降低了20％到30％。工程质量一般也好。这种新的施工方法是一种多快好省的合理的施工方法，今年还应该有步骤地推广。在推广中，也要正确地全面地掌握这种新施工方法的主要内容。这就是：（一）对工程项目进行合理的排队，缩短战线，集中优势兵力打歼灭战。完成一批再建一批，建成一个再来一个。（二）在一个厂房或建筑物上，把过去分工很细的专业工作队改为混合工作队，在职工群众中展开多面手运动，在一个工程上实行分层交叉平行流水作业的施工方法。（三）大大增加采用预制构件和装配工作的比重。（四）在施工工地上，各工种、甲乙方等实行一元化的集中领导。从这里可以看出，1959年基本建设施工方面的主要努力方向是缩短战线，集中力量，统一领导，改革劳动组织，提高施工技术，其结果又集中表现为施工速度的加快。因此，必须全面地总结和推广以上述的基本内容为中心的去年施工大跃进的经验，提高施工的管理水平和技术水平，才能做到多快好省。任何离开深入的细致的工作而片面追求快的作法，其结果不但不能达到快的目的，而且会在工作上造成损失。施工必须有准备，当然准备时间不能过长。一般工程要有施工规划，较大的工程要有施工组织设计。准备工作做好了，施工不但不会慢，反而会更快。在施工中，有时需要修改部分设计图纸，有些修改是为了校正设计的错误和不合理的地方，这是必需的。但是，凡属设计中影响到工程结构的重要部分，就需要征得设计部门的同意才能修改。换用建筑材料，也应该经过切实的验算和一定的批准手续。总之，要胆大心细，既要加快施工速度，注意节约，又要切实保证工程质量。施工部门的领导人员还要全面地抓思想，抓生产，抓生活。群众的干劲越大，越要关心群众的生活，要保证建筑工人、特别是高空作业工人有足够的休息时间，要保证工人安全生产。
    要提高工程质量，必须十分注意保证建筑材料的质量，无论是钢铁等金属材料，还是水泥、砖瓦、砂石等非金属材料，在出厂以前，要负责地检查产品质量，合格品才能出厂。在材料使用方面，质量差的材料不能用于基本建设工程的重要部分。在设计中选用材料，必须继续反对保守倾向，但是也要有必要的安全系数。施工部门不能在设计的必要的安全系数内去挖潜力。新材料和合格的代用材料应该采用，但要经过试验鉴定，证明确实合格，才普遍推广。
    在提高工程质量中，特别要注意大中型的水坝工程，这些工程关系到人民生命安全，在设计、施工、材料每一个方面，决不能有丝毫马虎。
    要多快好省地完成今年的基本建设任务，保证基本建设的数量、质量全面跃进，关键在于加强党的领导和大搞群众运动。省、市、自治区党委需要进一步加强对基本建设工作、特别是设计工作的领导。各设计、施工单位要在党的统一领导下，实行行政人员、技术人员和工人的三结合，把大家充分发动起来，把群众运动搞得更加红火。目前要开展提高工程质量、安全教育和提高技术的群众运动，使全面贯彻多快好省方针的思想深入人心，使工人的技术水平普遍提高一步。在目前的群众运动中，还要发动广大职工建立和健全一些必要的技术管理制度。改革规章制度的目的是为了搞好生产，发展生产力。不合理的规章制度必须废除；必要的合理的规章制度，则需要建立和健全起来。例如，设计工作中要有必要的审批制度，施工中要有保证工程质量和安全作业的各种制度，使用材料要有一定的检验制度，等等。同时，要发动群众参加管理，加强组织管理和技术管理的工作，使群众运动和集中领导很好地结合起来。
    1959年基本建设大跃进的序幕已经揭开。只要加强党的领导，大搞群众运动，进一步全面贯彻多快好省的方针，我们就能胜利完成今年的宏伟任务，使基本建设数量、质量双双跃进！
