Jilin, February 21st (Our Dispatch) – The massive container workshop building project of the Jilin Chemical Machinery Plant was completed in just thirty-five working days, with excellent construction quality, providing an example of fast and high-quality construction.

This project features a large prefabricated reinforced concrete structure with four wide spans. The workload was significant, with earthwork alone amounting to 19,000 cubic meters and concrete totaling 4,000 cubic meters. Under normal construction conditions, such a large project would take at least half a year to complete. However, the employees of the First Construction and Installation Engineering Company of the Jilin Chemical Industrial Company, who undertook this project, completed it in a short period despite the harsh winter construction conditions.

The key to achieving both speed and quality in this project was consistently adhering to a mass movement approach from beginning to end, while also strengthening organizational leadership at every stage, combining hard work with ingenuity to achieve "speed with skill" and "skill yielding speed."

Regarding construction planning, they conducted a thorough analysis and arrangement of the entire project before construction began, and convened technical personnel and worker forums to discuss the project progress and construction plans, so that each team, each shift, and each worker had a clear understanding of their assigned tasks. In terms of construction organization, four mixed combat teams were established based on the principle of facilitating cooperation, including earthwork, prefabrication, hoisting, and transportation. In terms of construction methods, multi-trade three-dimensional cross-operation and parallel flow operation methods were adopted, and an overall concept of creating conditions for the leading project in all aspects was established, ensuring the smooth progress of the leading project and guaranteeing the project's progress. At the same time, secondary trades such as plumbing, electrical, and carpentry were carried out in conjunction with the leading project using "inserting stitches wherever possible" and "finding stitches where there are none." In terms of project management, on-site management was strengthened, with management personnel being assigned to the site, and design modifications and supplements, technical problem handling, and plan issuance were all carried out on-site, so that management work was consistent with the construction progress, and problems were discovered and resolved at any time. In terms of technical measures, prefabricated structures were expanded, all possible machinery was utilized, the degree of mechanization was increased, and labor productivity was improved. By adopting the above measures, high-speed construction was established on a solid foundation.

In order to ensure that the project was both fast and of high quality, the company's Party committee consistently emphasized project quality from beginning to end. In addition to carrying out ideological education work through various forms of publicity, it also tightly grasped the design stage, the material stage, the construction stage, and the quality supervision stage. First, before construction, technical personnel, cadres, and worker representatives from the design department, construction department, and material supply department were convened to repeatedly review the drawings, and two to four different schemes were proposed for important parts such as the foundation position and the roof frame structure. Through four meetings, serious discussions, analyses, and comparisons were conducted, and finally, democratic approval was obtained. Second, the critical material stage for ensuring quality was grasped, and materials were strictly selected. Important materials such as concrete were tested by the central laboratory to ensure that the grade strength met certain standards, ensuring that there were no honeycombs or pitting in the concrete pouring project. During the concrete curing process, temperature measurement teams and insulation teams were organized to ensure quality under winter construction conditions. Third, during the construction process, both progress and quality were emphasized. While issuing construction tasks, quality was emphasized. When quality problems were discovered, on-site meetings were immediately convened to conduct on-the-spot inspections and improvements. Fourth, in order to meet the requirements of rapid construction, quality inspection work was strengthened. Full-time quality supervisors were set up in each team, and a system combining independent supervision and mass supervision was implemented, so that situations were reflected in a timely manner and improvements were made in a timely manner.

    快速优质施工的一个范例
    吉林化工机械厂建设中抓紧设计、材料、施工和质量检查
    庞大的容器车间厂房已建成，力争早日生产化工设备
    本报吉林21日电　吉林化工机械厂庞大的容器车间厂房工程，用三十五个工作日全部建成，工程质量良好，为快速优质施工提供了范例。
    这项工程有四个跨度宽的钢筋混凝土大型装配式结构。工程量很大，仅土方就有一万九千立方公尺，混凝土四千立方公尺。这样大的工程，按一般施工，最快也得半年才能建成。但是，承担这项工程的吉林化学工业公司第一建筑安装工程公司的职工，使这项工程在严寒的冬季施工条件下，短期完成了。
    这项工程达到速度快、质量好的关键是自始至终坚持大搞群众运动，同时又在每个环节上加强组织领导，把苦干与巧干结合起来，作到“快中加巧”、“巧中出快”。
    他们在施工计划方面，施工前，对全部工程进行了周密的分析和安排，并召集技术人员座谈会和工人座谈会，讨论工程进度和施工方案，使每个队、每个班和每个工人对自己所承担的任务，都了如指掌。在施工组织方面，以便于协作为原则，成立了土木、预制加工、起重吊装、运输等四个混合战斗队。在施工方法上，采用多工种立体交叉作业和平行流水作业的方法，并树立一切工程为主导工程创造条件的整体观念，使主导工程顺利进行，保证了工程进度。同时，水暖、电气、木工等次要工种，用“见缝插针”，“无缝找缝”的办法，与主导工程交叉进行。在工程管理方面，加强现场管理，把管理人员下放到现场，设计的修改补充、技术问题的处理、计划的下达都在现场进行，使管理工作与施工的进程一致，随时发现问题，随时处理。在技术措施方面、扩大预制结构，利用一切可能利用的机械，提高机械化程度，提高劳动生产率。由于采取了上述措施，就使高速度施工建立在可靠的基础上。
    为了保证工程既高速又优质，公司党委自始至终强调工程质量，除了通过各种宣传形式进行思想教育工作外，同时紧紧抓住设计关、材料关、施工关和质量监督关。第一，在施工前，召集设计部门、施工部门和材料供应部门的技术人员、干部和工人代表反复会审图纸，对基础位置和房架结构等重要部分提出两种至四种不同方案，通过四次会议，认真进行讨论、分析、比较，最后经过民主审定。第二，抓住保证质量关键的材料关，严格挑选材料。混凝土等重要材料都经过中央试验室化验，使标号强度达到一定标准，保证了混凝土浇灌工程没有蜂窝麻面。在混凝土养生过程中，组织了测温队和保温队，在冬季施工条件下保证了质量。第三，施工过程中，进度质量并重，下达施工任务的同时，就强调质量。发现质量问题，立刻召开现场会议，当场进行检查和改进。第四，适应快速施工的要求，加强了质量检查工作，在每个队里设专职质量监督员，并实行独立监督和群众监督相结合的制度，作到了及时反映情况，及时改进。
