Workers Should Pay Attention to Improving Their Theoretical Knowledge

Hou Keyi, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

In the past six months, the popularization of Marxist-Leninist theory among workers in Tianjin has achieved some success and accumulated some experience. The basic point is that Party committees at all levels must personally mobilize the masses, pay attention to solving the main problems in lectures, exchange experiences in a timely manner, and eliminate obstacles in learning, so as to consolidate and sustain theoretical study and continuously improve it. This is the fundamental guarantee for popularizing theoretical learning among workers. Without popularization, there is no way to talk about improvement; without timely improvement, it is impossible to continue popularizing. As the masses' study of theory becomes more widespread, the question of how to further improve becomes prominent. That is to say, on the one hand, we must continue to popularize, and on the other hand, the work of consolidation and improvement must keep up. If this problem is not solved, it will be impossible to ensure that the movement for workers to study theory is carried out in depth. On this issue, it should first be clear that the popularization and improvement of theory are both distinct and interconnected. The popularization of theory simultaneously requires improvement; without popularization, improvement lacks a foundation; without improvement, popularization lacks guidance. Therefore, on the basis of vigorously popularizing, we must pay attention to improvement at any time. At the beginning of popularization, it is necessary to break the masses' mysterious notions about philosophy, enhance their confidence in learning, and make them realize that the important significance of learning theory lies in raising awareness, improving work, and promoting production. Therefore, at the beginning, it is necessary to talk about some relatively simple and easy-to-understand things in theory based on the actual problems in the life and production of the unit or factory. For example, some factories start with the subjective and objective, and subjective initiative; some factories start with the principle of contradiction; some factories first talk about the question of correctly handling contradictions among the people, and so on. Everyone is interested in learning, which is good. However, the study of theory by workers, like the development of other things, is also a process of development from nothing to something, from simple to complex, and from low-level to high-level. Therefore, after the popularization movement is launched, some people will soon demand further improvement. The workers have great enthusiasm for learning theory, and they not only demand to solve certain aspects of problems in current life and production, but also demand to learn many Marxist-Leninist principles. Some active learners asked: "Is philosophy just these things? Can you talk a little more?" Others said: "At the beginning, you put forward a theoretical principle and repeatedly cited many facts to illustrate that it is correct. Now you should turn it around, give more principles, and don't give too many examples. We can understand if the examples are appropriate." Others said: "At the beginning, it was very good to cite our factory's affairs. It quickly broke our mysterious concept of philosophy. Now we should cite some major domestic and foreign events to let us know more things." This is what Chairman Mao said: "The people demand popularization, and then they also demand improvement, demanding improvement year by year and month by month" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume III, page 884). Workers demand to deepen, thoroughly explain, and more comprehensively and systematically explain the principles on the basis of their original knowledge, and let them know more. From this point of view, the study of Marxist-Leninist theory by workers, from popularization to improvement, should also be considered an inevitable law. In this sense, it can also be said that popularization and improvement are the same thing, and cannot be separated or mechanically divided into stages. Without popularization, there is no way to talk about improvement, and if improvement cannot be timely, it cannot continue to popularize, and cannot be consolidated and sustained.

Secondly, since each factory started lectures by talking about the problems existing in their own factory, and the situations of each factory are different, the problems discussed are inconsistent, and the amount cannot be the same. In a word, the principles generally spoken during popularization are simple, superficial, piecemeal and not systematic enough. Therefore, we cannot be satisfied with the achievements made in the popularization of theory, but should systematically teach some basic theoretical principles to workers in a planned way on the basis of popularization, so as to enable workers' learning to deepen step by step and continuously improve. Otherwise, as in some factories, popularization has also been carried out, but improvement has not kept up, and when a crash task comes, it falls into a state of stagnation or semi-stagnation. Of course, we must never talk about improvement without leaving the current practical problems and the existing level of workers. Both popularization and improvement require reading some books, but we cannot simply start from books and be divorced from reality. Otherwise, it can only produce dogmatism, and cannot truly improve the theoretical level of the working masses.

The fundamental way to solve the combination of popularization and improvement is to follow the mass line.

In the improvement of theoretical study, there are two problems that need to be solved, one is the teacher problem, and the other is the backbone training problem. At present, the strength of full-time theoretical cadres in Tianjin is not enough. At the same time, full-time theoretical cadres have limited knowledge of the situation at the grassroots level, and many do not understand production, which cannot but increase the difficulty for them to connect with reality. As the workers in some factories reflected: "The lectures are good, but they are too little related to our factory." "The teacher is not as good as the cadre, and the cadre from other factories is not as good as the cadre from this factory." Of course, this is not absolute, and it is by no means to say that full-time theory teachers are not needed. On the contrary, it is necessary to cultivate, use and give play to their strength in a planned and proper manner. This is one aspect of the problem. On the other hand, the scope of popularization is so wide, and it is required to deepen step by step and continuously improve. What should we do? According to the practice of this period, the fundamental way to solve the problem of combining popularization and improvement is to follow the mass line and combine the part-time theoretical team with the full-time theoretical team. In organizing the part-time theoretical team, we must cultivate the active elements that have been organized (including grassroots leading cadres, active workers in learning, and people with a higher level), and gradually improve their theoretical level. In other words, we must let them take the first step, and then gradually improve the workers in the factory through them. Doing so is conducive to solving the problems of popularization, improvement, consolidation, and sustainability.

Several good forms to solve popularization and improvement

To solve this problem, there must also be corresponding organizational forms. Since we do not have much experience, we can only encourage everyone to create. The existing forms and practices are as follows.

Teaching Station. Some grassroots cadres in the factory listen to lectures at the teaching station and then go back to lecture to the workers. This form was organized at the beginning of the workers' study of philosophy in Tianjin, and it also solved part of the problem, but some members who listened to lectures at the teaching station were not active elements who emerged in the learning process, and some were temporarily grabbed. There is a lack of planning, and after listening to the lectures, they go back to lecture, which cannot satisfy the workers. This method cannot fundamentally solve the problem.

Some factories have organized the active learners (mostly veteran workers and workshop cadres) into "philosophy research groups" and "philosophy teaching and research sections" to lead the learning of workers throughout the factory. Because they can closely combine the situation of their factory or workshop to study and explain the theory, the effect is very good. Even if the production tasks are tight, they can combine learning with production and persist in learning. But who will help them improve is a big problem. Although the leading cadres of some factories have a higher level, they are busy with work and have certain difficulties, and the theoretical knowledge level of the leading cadres of many factories is not high. In this case, the Hedong District Committee and Heping District Committee of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed a solution, which is to select backbones and active learners from the "philosophy teaching and research sections" and "philosophy research groups" of each factory in the district and some factories that have not established teaching and research institutions to form a district-wide lecturer group, regularly combining with the central tasks, and systematically explaining theoretical problems to them. We feel that this method is relatively good, at least everyone is satisfied today.

However, this cannot exclude other practices. For example, the workers' spare-time political theory study class attached to the municipal party committee's advanced cadre self-study class is also a good form. Although their strength is small and the number of students enrolled is small (only 37 people), the students are all learning backbones from nearby factories, and the scale is small, simple and easy to implement. We feel that party schools, cadre schools, and universities can also try to do it. This can not only solve the problem of training some workers' learning backbones, but also enable our cadres engaged in theoretical education to approach reality and get exercise.

Although we have done some work on the issue of improvement, we are still in the process of exploration and have not yet passed the test. We need to further give play to the creative spirit of Party committees at all levels and solve this problem as soon as possible.

    工人学理论要注意提高
    中共天津市委宣传部副部长　　侯岢一
    半年来，天津市工人学习马克思列宁主义理论的普及工作，取得了一些成绩和经验。其中基本之点是：各级党委要亲自动手发动群众，注意解决讲课中的主要问题，及时交流经验，消除学习中的障碍，使理论学得以巩固持久和不断提高这是在工人中普及理论学习的根本保证。没有普及当然谈不上提高，不及时提高，也就不能继续普及随着群众学习理论的普及，如何进一步提高的问题就突出起来了。这就是说，一方面要继续普及，另一方面，巩固和提高的工作也要跟上去，这个问题不解决，也就无法保证工人学习理论的运动得到深入的开展。在这个问题上，首先应该明确，理论的普及和提高是互相区别又互相联系的。理论的普及，同时就要求着提高；没有普及，提高就缺乏基础，没有提高，普及就缺乏指导。因此，要在大力普及的基础上，随时注意提高。普及之始，要破除群众对哲学的神秘观念，提高他们的学习信心，使他们认识学习理论的重要意义在于提高觉悟，改进工作和促进生产。因此，开始时，根据本单位或本厂的生活与生产中的实际问题，在理论上讲些比较浅显易懂的东西，是必要的。如有的工厂是从主观与客观、主观能动性讲起，有的厂从矛盾原理讲起，有的厂先讲正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题等等，大家学起来，有兴趣就好。但工人学理论与其他事物的发展一样，也是从无到有，从简单到复杂，从低级到高级的发展过程。因此，普及运动开展起来后，很快就会有人要求进一步提高。工人群众学习理论的气魄是很大的，他们不仅要求解决当前生活中、生产中某一方面的问题，而且要求学很多马列主义道理。有些学习积极分子问：“哲学就是这些东西吗？能不能再多讲一点？”还有的说：“在开始时你们提出一个理论原则，反复举出很多事实来说明是对的，现在你们应该翻过来，多给讲些道理，例子不要太多，举的恰当我们就能理解了。”还有的说：“开始时你们举我们厂子的事讲很好，很快就打破了我们对哲学的神秘观念，现在应举国内、国外一些大事，叫我们多知道一些东西。”这就是毛主席讲的：“人民要求普及，跟着也就要求提高，要求逐年逐月地提高”（“毛泽东选集”卷三、八八四页）。工人要求在他们原有的基础上，把道理再讲深一点、讲透一点，讲的更全面更系统一点，叫他们多知道一些。这样看来，工人学习马克思列宁主义理论，从普及到提高，也应认为是一个必然规律。在这个意义上讲，也可以说普及与提高是一回事，不能截然分开，也不能机械地划分阶段。没有普及当然谈不上提高，而不能及时提高，也就不能继续普及，不能巩固和持久。
    其次，由于各厂在开始讲课时都是先从本厂存在的问题讲起的，而各厂情况不同，讲的问题不一致，份量也不能一致，一句话，在普及时一般讲的道理是简单的、浅显的、零碎而不够系统的，因此我们也不能满足于理论普及工作所取得的成绩，而应在普及的基础上，有计划地把一些基本的理论原理，系统地教给工人，这样才能使工人的学习步步深入，不断提高。否则正如有些工厂一样，普及也搞起来了，但提高没有跟上去，突击任务一来，就陷于停顿或半停顿的状态。当然，决不能离开当前的实际问题，离开工人现有的水平空谈提高，普及与提高都需要念些书，但不能单纯从书本出发，脱离实际。否则，只能产生教条主义，而不能真正提高工人群众的理论水平。
        解决普及和提高相结合
      的根本办法是走群众路线
    在理论学习的提高中，有两个问题需要解决，一个是教员问题，一个是骨干培养问题。目前天津市专职理论干部的力量是不够的，同时专职理论干部对基层情况的了解有限，很多人不懂得生产，这就不能不给他们增加联系实际的困难。正如有些厂的工人所反映的：“讲的不错，就是联系我们厂的事太少了”。“教员不如干部讲的好，外厂干部不如本厂干部讲的好。”当然，这不是绝对的，也丝毫不是说专职理论教员不需要，相反地，必须有计划地妥善地培养、使用和发挥他们的力量。这是问题的一方面。另一方面，普及的面这样广，而又要求步步深入，不断提高，怎样办？根据这一段的实践，解决普及和提高相结合问题的根本办法，就是走群众路线，兼职理论队伍与专职理论队伍并举。在组织兼职理论队伍方面，要把已经组织起来的积极分子（包括基层领导干部、工人学习积极分子和水平较高一点的人）加以培养，逐步提高他们的理论水平。换句话说，要他们先走一步，通过他们再去逐步提高本厂工人，这样做，便于解决普及、提高、巩固、持久的问题。
      解决普及和提高的几种好形式
    解决这个问题，还要有相适应的组织形式，由于我们的经验不多，只能鼓励大家来创造，目前已有的形式和做法有以下几种。
    传授站。工厂的一些基层干部在传授站听讲之后，回去给工人讲。这种形式在天津市工人学哲学一开始就组织起来了，也解决了一部分问题，但是有些到传授站听讲的成员并不是在学习中涌现出来的积极分子，有些是临时抓来的，计划性差，听完传授后回去讲，并不能使工人满意。这种方式还不能根本解决问题。
    有些工厂把学习积极分子（多是老工人、车间干部）组成“哲学研究组”、“哲学教研室”，通过这些骨干来领导全厂工人的学习。由于他们能紧密结合本厂或本车间的情况来研究和讲解理论，因而效果很好，即使生产任务紧张，他们也能把学习与生产结合起来坚持学习。但是谁来帮助他们提高，这是个大问题。有些工厂的领导干部虽然水平较高，但工作忙，有一定的困难，而且不少工厂的领导干部自身的理论知识水平也并不高。在这种情况下，中共天津市河西区委、和平区委提出了解决问题的办法，就是从全区各厂“哲学教研室”、“哲学研究组”和一些没有建立起教学研究机构的厂子，挑选骨干和学习积极分子，组成全区性的讲师团，定期结合中心任务，有计划地系统地给他们讲解理论问题。这个方法我们初步感到比较好，至少今天大家还满意。
    不过不能因此排除其他的做法，如市委高干自修班附设的工人业余政治理论学习班，也是一种好形式，虽然由于他们的力量小，招收人数不多（仅三十七人），但学员都是附近厂子的学习骨干，规模小，简而易行。我们觉得党校、干部学校、大学也可试办，这样既可解决一部分工人学习骨干的培养问题，同时又可使我们从事理论教育工作的干部接近实际，得到锻炼。
    虽然在提高问题上我们做了一些工作，但我们还是在摸索过程中，没有过关，还需要进一步发挥各级党委的创造精神，尽快的解决这方面的问题。
