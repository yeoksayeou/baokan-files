Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 13th: The broad masses of workers in Shanghai, while vigorously carrying out the technical revolution and marching towards high-grade, large-scale, precision, and cutting-edge products, have received comprehensive and selfless assistance from the Soviet Union.

Shanghai’s machinery, electrical machinery, and other industries have gone through the stages of repair and imitation in recent years and have begun to design and manufacture independently. Particularly since the Great Leap Forward in production last year, many new products have been successfully trial-produced, and some cutting-edge technologies have been initially mastered. The achievement of these results is inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to our country.

With the help of Soviet experts, the Shanghai Instrument Factory successfully trial-produced 21 new types of measuring instruments, physical optical instruments, and microscopes last year, exceeding the total of new products in the First Five-Year Plan, and plans to trial-produce 22 types this year. The Shanghai Machine Tool Factory has become a famous factory in our country for manufacturing precision grinding machines and will trial-produce various high-precision products this year. The Shanghai Tool Factory has developed into a modern factory capable of manufacturing various high-grade and precision tools. The work of these factories has been helped by Soviet brothers. When the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory was preparing to design a high-precision screw grinding machine, Rabaotkina, the chief designer of the Moscow Internal Grinding Machine Factory who was helping this factory, brought some of the drawings that their factory had just designed to Shanghai during her vacation back to her country. When the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory trial-produced China's first self-designed Dongfeng brand universal diesel engine, Soviet experts Shatilov and Sibachev provided the most advanced technical design data and made very important suggestions. This diesel engine saves fuel, has a long life, and is lightweight, reaching an advanced level.

In the Great Leap Forward in industrial production in Shanghai, Soviet experts worked hard and skillfully with Chinese workers and technicians with great enthusiasm. When a nationwide upsurge of steelmaking by the whole people was launched, the Shanghai Instrument Factory had to produce a large number of steel inspection microscopes in a short period of time to support the whole country. Naryeshkin, a measuring instrument design expert at this factory, took the initiative to participate in the design of the steel inspection microscope, sometimes working until late at night. Another expert working at this factory, Tikhonov, also gave his notes of about 30 years of work in factories and scientific institutions to the factory to be translated. He is about to return to his country soon, and these days he is still rushing to write experience materials about new technologies for the factory.

In the process of vigorously carrying out the technical revolution and marching towards high-grade, large-scale, precision, and cutting-edge products, the broad masses of workers in Shanghai attach great importance to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. When a worker from the Shanghai No. 2 Steel Plant visited the Soviet Red October Steel Plant, he saw that the plant's automatic steel tapping machine was very good and prepared to learn from it. The factory sent the drawings of the automatic steel tapping machine before he returned to Shanghai. In the reading room of the Shanghai Library, there are often a large number of workers buried in reading Soviet science and technology books. Last year alone, Shanghai received 150,000 copies of Soviet science and technology books, many of which are related to cutting-edge sciences such as the peaceful use of atomic energy, radioactive isotopes, semiconductors, ultrasonics, and industrial automation. Many books and periodicals were sent to Shanghai one or two months after they were published in the Soviet Union.

### 上海职工在苏联援助下猛攻技术堡垒  试制成功许多高级、大型、精密、尖端新产品

    上海职工在苏联援助下猛攻技术堡垒
    试制成功许多高级、大型、精密、尖端新产品
    新华社上海13日电　上海广大职工群众在大搞技术革命向高级、大型、精密、尖端产品进军当中，得到苏联全面的、无私的援助。
    上海机械、电机等工业几年来走过了修配和仿制的阶段，开始自行设计和独立制造；特别是去年生产大跃进以来，试制成功了许多新产品，并且初步掌握了一些尖端技术。这些成绩的获得都和苏联对我国的无私援助分不开。
    上海仪器厂在苏联专家的帮助下，去年试制成功了二十一种新的计量仪、物理光学仪和显微镜，超过了第一个五年计划新产品的总和，今年还要试制二十二种；上海机床厂已经成为我国制造精密磨床的著名工厂，今年还要试制多种高精度的产品；上海工具厂已经发展成为能够制造多种高级、精密工具的现代化工厂。这些厂的工作都曾经得到苏联兄弟般的帮助。当上海机床厂准备设计一种高精度螺丝磨床的时候，帮助这个厂工作的莫斯科内圆磨床厂主任设计师拉鲍脱基娜，利用休假回国的机会，把她们厂刚设计好的一部分图纸带来上海。上海柴油机厂试制我国第一台自行设计的东风牌万能柴油机时，苏联专家沙季洛夫、西巴乔夫提供了最先进的技术设计资料和数据，并且提出了很重要的建议。这种柴油机用油省、寿命长、体重轻，达到了先进水平。
    在上海工业生产大跃进当中，苏联专家以极大的热情，同中国工人、技术人员一起苦干、巧干。当全国掀起全民炼钢高潮的时候、上海仪器厂要在短期内生产大批检验钢的质量的验钢镜支援全国各地，这个工厂的计量仪器设计专家纳雷什金主动参加验钢镜的设计工作，有时一直工作到深夜。在这个厂工作的另一个专家吉洪诺夫，还把自己在工厂、科学机关工作约三十年的笔记，交给工厂翻译出来。他很快就要回国了，这几天还在为工厂赶写有关新技术的经验材料。
    上海广大职工在大搞技术革命，向高大精尖进军的过程中，十分重视学习苏联的先进经验。上钢二厂一位工人在苏联红十月钢铁厂参观时，看到这个厂的自动出钢机很好，就准备学习。这家工厂没有等他回到上海就把自动出钢机的图纸寄来了。在上海图书馆的阅览室里，经常有大批职工在埋头阅读苏联的科技书籍。去年一年里，上海收到苏联的科技书籍有十五万册，其中不少是有关和平利用原子能、放射性同位素、半导体、超声波、工业自动化等尖端科学的书籍。很多书刊在苏联出版后一、二个月就寄到了上海。
