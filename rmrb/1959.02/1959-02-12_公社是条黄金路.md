    The Commune is a Golden Road
    How much blood the martyrs shed, how much hardship the people suffered, from small paths to wide roads, the commune's avenue is so broad. When stomachs are empty, go to the canteen, when bodies are cold, there are clothes to wear, children all go to nurseries, the elderly all enter homes of happiness, tall buildings are built everywhere in the farm villages, cars drive to the front of the house. Everyone labors for the public good, everyone performs and everyone watches, clothing, food, housing, and education are all provided, people no longer need to use money. The commune is a golden road, shining brightly to the highest heavens.

    公社是条黄金路
    戈壁舟烈士流过多少血，人民遭过多少难，走过小路走大路，公社大道好宽展。肚子饿了进食堂，身上冷了有衣穿，娃娃都上托儿所，老人都进幸福院，农庄到处修高楼，汽车开到家门前。人人劳动天下公，大家演戏大家看，衣食住行受教育，人再不知要用钱。公社是条黄金路，光辉灿烂上九天。
