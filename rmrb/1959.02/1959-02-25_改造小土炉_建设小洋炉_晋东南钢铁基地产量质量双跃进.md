Transforming Small Indigenous Furnaces, Constructing Small Modern Furnaces
Jin Southeast Iron and Steel Base Achieves Double Leap in Production and Quality

(Reported by our newspaper) The Jin Southeast Special District of Shanxi Province has adopted the method of "integrating construction with production as the main focus" and "transforming from indigenous to modern" to consolidate the iron and steel base in a down-to-earth manner, enabling both production and construction of the iron and steel base to make great leaps forward.

The method of consolidating the iron and steel base by integrating construction with production as the main focus and transforming from indigenous to modern was first explored by Jincheng County in this special district. During the nationwide steelmaking campaign, Jincheng County built six modern furnaces, five hundred indigenous blast furnaces, and more than eight thousand indigenous square and round furnaces, all of which have been operating normally. Last winter and this spring, the Jincheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party studied the situation of the small indigenous furnace groups and believed that the small indigenous furnace groups must be transformed into small modern furnace groups as soon as possible, and that the existing small indigenous furnaces must be rectified. The county committee then transferred a large number of cadres to help the iron and steel base establish factories, departments, offices, and workshops, and to improve the Party and Youth League organizations, fix the production team, and establish management systems. At the same time, the masses were mobilized to manufacture a large number of indigenous blowers and meters to modernize the indigenous furnaces; and a large number of indigenous wind drills were manufactured to mechanize mining. On this basis, each iron and steel base also strengthened the construction of new furnaces. This not only greatly increased the output of the original indigenous blast furnaces, but also built a batch of new modern blast furnaces.

Now, all thirty iron and steel bases and forty-eight iron and steel key points in the Jin Southeast Special District, according to the experience of Jincheng, have quickly normalized production, democratized management, and industrialized enterprises after rectification. Twenty-two iron and steel bases, including Liugou, Dayang, Xinbi, Liyi, Yingchao, and Ciying, have installed blowers and meters on the indigenous blast furnaces. After workers use mechanical operations, the output has increased by 40% compared to the original, and the production of poor-quality iron has been eliminated.

Carrying out construction on the basis of normal production order and increased production not only makes it possible for leaders to grasp construction while grasping production, but also further inspires the enthusiasm of workers and creates conditions for construction. After the rectification of the Liugou Iron and Steel Base, the workers expressed that the iron and steel base has a promising future, and they have even greater enthusiasm than in the past, building factories in the face of severe cold. From December of last year to now, a new 13-cubic-meter modern blast furnace has been built, as well as twelve factories including refractory brick factories, blue brick factories, lime factories, cement factories, and coke factories. Now, the construction of the Jin Southeast Special District's iron and steel base, like its production, has formed a new upsurge. Twenty-one out of the thirty bases are actively building new modern furnaces. In the past month, thirty-four new modern furnaces have been built, thirty-six are under construction, and another sixty 8-cubic-meter small modern furnaces will be completed in the first quarter.

The method of consolidating the iron and steel base by transforming from indigenous to modern and integrating construction with production as the main focus has created extremely favorable conditions for training technical personnel. Most of the workers from the countryside lack scientific knowledge, and it is quite difficult for them to master the operating techniques of modern furnaces all at once, but it is relatively easy to master the furnaces that are being transformed from indigenous to modern. Now, there are already several thousand people in the entire special district who can operate modern furnaces for production. The Liugou Iron and Steel Base has trained more than 500 ironmaking experts and mining experts. The person in charge of the Industry Department of the Jin Southeast District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party said: "In the past, it was very difficult to train modern furnace technicians. Now, before each new modern furnace is completed, we can train a furnace leader, three shift workers, and one or two technicians."

    改造小土炉  建设小洋炉
    晋东南钢铁基地产量质量双跃进
    本报讯　山西省晋东南专区采取“以生产为主结合建设”和“由土变洋”的办法，踏踏实实地整顿钢铁基地，使钢铁基地的生产和建设双双跃进。
    以生产为主结合建设和由土变洋整顿钢铁基地的办法，是这个专区的晋城县首先摸索出来的。晋城县在全民大战钢铁中，建起了六座洋炉，五百座土高炉，八千多个土方炉和土圆炉，并都已进行正常生产。去冬今春，中共晋城县委研究了小土炉群的情况，认为小土炉群必须尽快地向小洋炉群过渡，必须对现有的小土炉进行整顿工作。县委随即抽调了大批干部，帮助钢铁基地建立了厂部、科室和车间，并且健全了党团组织，固定了生产队伍，建立了管理制度。同时发动群众制造了大量的土风机，土仪表，使土炉洋化；制造了大量的土风钻，使采矿机械化。在这个基础上，各个钢铁基地又加强了建设新炉的工作。这样，不仅使原有的土高炉产量很快提高，同时还建设起一批新的洋高炉。
    现在，全晋东南专区的三十个钢铁基地，四十八个钢铁基点，根据晋城的经验，进行整顿以后，也很快地实现了生产正常化，管理民主化，企业工厂化。柳沟、大阳、辛壁、礼义、应朝、茨营等二十二个钢铁基地的土高炉上装起了风机、仪表，工人用机械操作以后，产量比原来提高了40％，并且消灭了质量不好的铁。
    在生产秩序正常、生产提高的基础上进行建设，不仅领导有可能在抓生产同时抓建设，而且进一步鼓舞了职工的积极性和为建设创造了条件。柳沟钢铁基地在整顿之后，职工们都表示钢铁基地有奔头，干劲较过去更大，冒着严寒建设工厂。从去年12月到现在为止，新建起一座十三立方的洋高炉，和耐火砖厂、青砖厂、石灰厂、水泥厂、焦炭厂等十二个工厂。现在，晋东南专区钢铁基地的建设和生产一样，形成了新的高潮，三十个基地中有二十一个基地积极建设新洋炉。一个月来，已建起新洋炉三十四座，正在动工兴建的三十六座，另有六十座八立方的小洋炉，将在第一季度建成。
    由土变洋和以生产为主结合建设整顿钢铁基地的办法，为培养技术人材创造了极为有利的条件。从农村来的工人，大都缺乏科学知识，要他们一下子掌握洋炉的操作技术有相当困难，但是掌握由土变洋的炉子就比较容易。现在全专区已有好几千人能操作洋炉生产。柳沟钢铁基地培养出的炼铁能手、采矿能手达五百多人。中共晋东南地委会工业部负责人说：过去培养洋炉技术工人很困难，现在，在每个新洋炉建成之前，就能给培养出一个炉长，三个值班的和一两个技术人员。
