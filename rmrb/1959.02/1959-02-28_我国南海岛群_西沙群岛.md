    China's South China Sea Islands - The Xisha Islands
    The Xisha Islands in the South China Sea, southeast of Hainan Island, together with the Zhongsha Islands and Nansha Islands, have always been China's territory, and China has full sovereignty over these islands.
    Recently, the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem government has once again clamored that the Xisha Islands belong to it. People remember that in 1956, when the ambitious elements in the Philippines attempted to invade China's Nansha Islands, the Ngo Dinh Diem government took the opportunity to act, attempting to invade these islands belonging to China, saying that South Vietnam possessed "traditional sovereignty" not only over the Nansha Islands but also over the Xisha Islands. Since the last century, imperialist countries have repeatedly attempted to invade these Chinese islands in the South China Sea, but all have ended in failure. In recent years, U.S. imperialism has also carried out various activities, attempting to obliterate China's sovereignty over these islands.
    In 1951, in the one-sided peace treaty with Japan that the United States manufactured, it deliberately stipulated only that Japan renounce its rights to Nanwei Island and the Xisha Islands, without mentioning the issue of returning these islands to China, laying a pretext for invading these islands. The Chinese government exposed this conspiracy of the United States in a statement issued on August 15 of the same year and reaffirmed China's sovereignty over these islands.
    The South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem government is using the one-sided peace treaty with Japan as an excuse to put forward the so-called "traditional sovereignty" over the Xisha Islands. However, historical facts prove that it is China that has traditional sovereignty over these islands. As early as the beginning of the fifteenth century, the Xisha Islands were already Chinese territory. In many ancient Chinese books, such as Fei Xin's "Xingcha Shenglan" and Huang Shengceng's "Xiyang Chaogong Dianlu," there are detailed records about the Xisha Islands. The names "Qizhou Yang" and "Qili Yang," mentioned in these ancient books, refer to the Xisha Islands. The Xisha Islands consist of dozens of islands and reefs, none of which are large in area, and are roughly divided into three parts: the Xuande Islands, the Yongle Islands, and other islands and reefs. Yongxing Island in the Xuande Islands is the largest, with an area of approximately 1,851,000 square meters. These islands have always been the fishing grounds for fishermen from Hainan Island, about 150 nautical miles from Yulin Port. In 1907, Li Zhun, the Guangdong Naval Admiral under the Qing government, led the navy to inspect the Xisha Islands and held a grand ceremony, naming and inscribing each island on stone tablets. This was precisely to prevent the covetousness of foreign ambitious people at that time.
    After 1930, France once invaded the Nansha Islands and made demands on the Xisha Islands. This unreasonable demand by France directly violated the treaty between China and France. Article 3 of the 1887 "China-France Boundary Convention" clearly stipulates the maritime boundary, stating that "all islands east of this line belong to China, and Jiutou Mountain (Vietnamese name Ge Duo) and all small islands in the sea west of this line belong to Vietnam." The Xisha and Nansha Islands are all east of the boundary line, and according to the treaty text, they naturally belong to China. The Chinese government at the time rejected France's unreasonable demands based on reason.
    After World War II, French colonialists re-invaded Vietnam. The Chinese government officially dispatched the navy in December 1946 and January 1947 to accept the islands in the South China Sea under the recognition of various countries. Subsequently, although the French navy forcibly landed on Coral Island in the Xisha Islands, under the questioning of the Chinese government at the time, the French Ambassador to China, M. Merillon, was forced to state that the French navy's actions were "not instructed by the French government." Later, France, realizing that it was in the wrong, tried to avoid direct negotiations and proposed to resolve this "dispute" that did not exist at all through international arbitration. This was rejected by the Chinese government at the time.
    Whether from a historical or international treaty perspective, China has indisputable sovereignty over the Xisha Islands, and the clamoring of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime is baseless.

### 我国南海岛群—西沙群岛

    我国南海岛群—西沙群岛
    在海南岛东南的南海中的西沙群岛，同中沙群岛和南沙群岛一起，向来都是我国的领土，我国对这些群岛具有充分的主权。
    最近南越吴庭艳政府竟然又一次叫嚷西沙群岛是属于它的。人们记得，1956年当菲律宾的野心分子妄图侵占我国南沙群岛的时候，吴庭艳政府就曾借机活动，妄想侵占这些属于我国的岛屿，说什么南越不但对南沙群岛而且对西沙群岛也拥有“传统的主权”。从上世纪以来，帝国主义国家曾几次企图侵占在南海中的我国这些岛群，但是都以失败告终。最近几年，美帝国主义也进行了种种活动，企图抹杀我国对这些岛屿的主权。
    1951年，美国在它一手制造的片面对日和约中，故意仅仅规定日本放弃对南威岛和西沙群岛的权利，而不提这些岛屿归还中国的问题，为侵占这些岛屿预伏下借口。我国政府于同年8月15日发表的声明中曾揭露了美国的这一阴谋，并重申中国对这些岛屿的主权。
    南越吴庭艳政府正是以片面的对日和约为借口提出所谓对西沙群岛的“传统的主权”的。但是历史事实证明，对这些群岛有传统的主权的正是中国。远在十五世纪初期，西沙群岛就已经是中国的领土。在我国的许多古书中，例如费信的“星槎胜览”和黄省曾的“西洋朝贡典录”中，都有关于西沙群岛的详细纪载，这些古书中所提到的“七洲洋”和“七里洋”等名称都是指西沙群岛而言。西沙群岛共有数十个岛礁，面积都不大，大体分为三部分：宣德群岛，永乐群岛和其他岛礁，宣德群岛中的永兴岛最大，面积约一百八十五万一千平方公尺。这些岛屿一向是我国海南岛渔民捕鱼的所在，距榆林港约一百五十海里。1907年清政府所属广东水师提督李准曾率领海军视察了西沙群岛，还特别举行了一次隆重的典礼，将各岛命名勒石。这正是为了防止当时外国野心家的窥伺。
    1930年后法国曾一度侵占南沙群岛并对西沙群岛提出要求。法国的这一无理要求直接违反了中法之间的条约，1887年的“中法界务专约”第三款中明确规定海上界线，说明“该线以东各海岛归中国，该线以西海中九头山（越名格多）及各小岛归越南”，西沙、南沙两群岛都在界线之东，照约文规定，当然属于中国。当时的中国政府据理拒绝了法国无理的要求。
    第二次世界大战后，法国殖民者重新侵入越南。我国政府曾于1946年12月和1947年1月在各国公认下派遣海军正式接受了南中国海各岛屿。其后，法国海军虽曾强行在西沙群岛的珊瑚岛登陆，在当时中国政府的质问下，法国驻华公使梅里蔼曾被迫表示，法国海军的行动“并非出于法国政府之指使”；后来法国自知理屈，力图避免正面交涉，提出用国际仲裁的办法来解决这个根本不存在的“纠纷”。这在当时已被中国政府拒绝了。
    从历史上或从国际条约来看，我国对西沙群岛都拥有无可置辩的主权，吴庭艳政权的叫嚷是毫无根据的。
