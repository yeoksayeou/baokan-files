    The Fierce Struggle Before Dawn
    – The Current Stage of the Cameroonian People's Struggle for Independence
    陶恺
    According to the firm demands of the Cameroonian people and the resolution of the United Nations Trusteeship Council in November last year, the northern and southern regions of Cameroon, currently under British and French rule, will achieve independence in 1960. However, to date, neither Britain nor France has taken any concrete measures to implement this resolution. On the contrary, they are intensifying armed suppression and political persecution against the Cameroonian people,打击民族独立运动, in order to prepare, under various disguises, for continuing colonial rule, rendering independence nominal when the date of Cameroonian independence arrives next year.

    Therefore, in the period before independence, the Cameroonian people's struggle for national independence will enter a stage of intense battle before dawn. The struggle at this stage is not only of great significance for the future development of the Cameroonian national independence movement, but will also have a great impact on the national independence movements in West and Central Africa.

    The relevant resolutions of the African People's Conference held at the end of last year strongly supported the struggle of the Cameroonian people, and called on all African organizations and people of all countries who sympathize with the just struggle of the African people to hold a "Cameroon Day" on February 20 this year, when the United Nations resumes discussion of the Cameroon issue, to support the Cameroonian people. This resolution has been supported by the people of Africa and Asia.

    South of the Sahara Desert, Cameroon is one of the regions where the struggle between national revolutionary forces and colonialists is particularly acute. After the Second World War, nationalist parties such as the "Cameroon People's Union" and the "Cameroon Democratic Women's League" emerged in Cameroon, leading the people in the struggle against colonial rule. After the Asian-African Conference in 1955, the Cameroonian national independence movement began to enter a climax. On April 22, 1955, various parties in Cameroon issued a joint declaration demanding an end to the trusteeship system and the establishment of a sovereign Cameroonian state. The French colonial authorities responded to this just demand with frenzied suppression. Within a few weeks, more than 5,000 Cameroonian people were killed in what is known as the "May Massacre." However, the Cameroonian people were not intimidated by this frantic action by France, and under the leadership of the "People's Union," they continued to carry out the struggle for national independence and the unification of the northern and southern regions. In the summer of 1956, this struggle developed into an armed struggle. In 1957, this struggle quickly spread to the Sanaga Maritime and Bassa regions. In March and April last year, an armed uprising broke out in the Bamiléké region, with 70,000 to 80,000 participants. The French authorities repeatedly increased their troops to suppress the uprising, but still could not extinguish the armed struggle of the Cameroonian people. The organized large-scale anti-imperialist armed struggle of the Cameroonian people has thus become the most notable event south of the Sahara Desert. At the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held at the end of 1957, the Conference of Independent African States held in 1958, and the African People's Conference, the heroic struggle of the Cameroonian people received widespread sympathy and enthusiastic support. The persistent struggle of the Cameroonian people and the vigorous development of the national independence movement throughout Africa have forced relevant parties to consider the issue of Cameroon achieving independence within a time limit. In late October last year, the Cameroonian Legislative Assembly passed a resolution by a vote of 46 to 7, demanding complete independence on January 1, 1960. Subsequently, France also expressed its attitude to the United Nations Trusteeship Council, agreeing to Cameroon's "independence" on January 1, 1960. However, the "independence" agreed to by France was only "independence" within the "French Community." Within this "Community," powers such as military and diplomatic affairs are still controlled by France. Britain, on the other hand, took the merger of Northern Cameroon into Nigeria as a prerequisite for achieving "independence." So, what would be left for a so-called "independent" Cameroon to handle itself?

    How much difference can be found in essence between such an "independent" government and today's so-called Cameroonian "autonomous government"?

    The hypocritical face of the French authorities was quickly exposed in the actual struggle in Cameroon, and military suppression activities are still being carried out frantically. The more than 80,000 French colonial troops stationed in Cameroon have not only not been reduced, but have been strengthened immediately after the Congolese people's struggle against colonial rule broke out. More than 60,000 Cameroonian people are still imprisoned in prisons or concentration camps, suffering all kinds of abuse. The nationalist party "Cameroon People's Union," which is supported by the broad masses of the people, is still declared "illegal" today. Other nationalist parties are also constantly persecuted by the colonial authorities. In the vast territory of Cameroon, there is no sign that France is willing to give up its colonial rule here in a few months.

    Within the United Nations, the hypocritical faces of France and Britain are also very blatant. They verbally declare that they "agree" to Cameroon's independence in 1960, but when voting on any proposals that are beneficial to the national independence movement in the trust territories, they invariably and resolutely oppose them. During the discussion of the future of Cameroon in the United Nations Trusteeship Council in November last year, Britain and France resolutely opposed the proposals of socialist countries and Asian-African countries regarding the steps to Cameroon's independence. The "reason" held by France was that the substantive issue of Cameroon's independence could only be discussed after listening to the report of the delegation sent by the United Nations to Cameroon. Britain even absurdly used the rainy season as a "reason" to oppose holding a referendum in Cameroon this year.

    The stubborn attitude of Britain and France has been supported and sheltered by the United States. The United States has invariably stood with Britain and France in the United Nations Trusteeship Council to oppose any positive proposals put forward by socialist countries and Asian-African countries on the Cameroon issue. Not only that, but the United States has also played an extremely bad role in the United Nations delegation sent to Cameroon, doing its best to whitewash the bloody rule of Britain and France in Cameroon. When the United Nations delegation, with American representatives, arrived in Cameroon in 1955, the French authorities were massacring thousands of Cameroonian people, even committing such crimes in the face of the United Nations delegation, but the report of the delegation made no mention of these situations. Last autumn, a United Nations delegation led by the United States went to Cameroon for inspection again. The delegation issued a report on January 30 this year, avoiding the major issues before independence, such as stopping the military suppression and political persecution by Britain and France, and withdrawing British and French troops. Instead, it put forward a proposal to permanently divide the northern and southern regions of Cameroon. This report is obviously in line with the wishes of the British and French colonialists. According to the Cameroon People's Union, the head of the United Nations delegation, US representative Griggs, had held several secret talks with certain figures in Cameroon in order to further expand US interests and influence in Cameroon in the future. Obviously, this is precisely the true purpose of the United States' consistent support for Britain and France on the Cameroon issue.

    The Cameroon People's Union and the broad masses of the people have repeatedly declared that before independence is achieved, it is necessary to: 1. Immediately withdraw British and French troops and military police; 2. Immediately stop all political persecution; 3. Guarantee freedom of speech and political activity; 4. Immediately release all those arrested. Because only in this way can the Cameroonian people freely express their own opinions, choose the government they need, and decide on major issues related to the realization of independence.

    The Cameroonian people have waged a long-term struggle to get rid of colonial rule and achieve national independence. In the past three years, the Cameroonian national revolutionary forces have been tempered and strengthened in the fiery armed struggle. More than 5,000 patriotic people have contributed their lives to the cause of national independence in the armed struggle. Neither the political deception nor the bloody suppression of imperialism can change the determination of the Cameroonian people to fight for independence. With the active support of socialist countries and Asian-African countries, the Cameroonian people will continue to forge ahead courageously on their own path and eradicate the colonial rule imposed on them forever in the near future.

    黎明前的激烈斗争
    ——喀麦隆人民争取独立的现阶段
    陶恺
    根据喀麦隆人民的坚决要求和联合国托管委员会在去年11月间的决议，目前处于英法两国统治下的喀麦隆南北两个地区，将在1960年取得独立。可是，迄今为止，英法两国并没有为实现这一决议采取任何具体措施。相反地，它们正在对喀麦隆人民加紧进行武装镇压和政治迫害，打击民族独立运动，以便在明年喀麦隆独立日期到来以前，做好准备工作，继续在种种伪装下实行殖民统治，使独立成为有名无实。
    因此，在独立前的一段时期里，喀麦隆人民争取民族独立的斗争将进入一个拂晓前的激战阶段。这个阶段的斗争，不仅对于喀麦隆民族独立运动的今后发展有着重大意义，而且对于西非和中非地区的民族独立运动也会发生很大影响。
    去年年底举行的非洲人民大会的有关决议中，着重地支持了喀麦隆人民的斗争，并且要求非洲所有的组织和同情非洲人民正义斗争的各国人民，在今年2月20日联合国恢复讨论喀麦隆问题这一天，举行“喀麦隆日”，声援喀麦隆人民。这个决议得到了非洲和亚洲人民的支持。
    在撒哈拉沙漠以南，喀麦隆是民族革命力量和殖民主义者斗争特别尖锐的地区之一。第二次世界大战以后，喀麦隆境内就出现了“喀麦隆人民联盟”、“喀麦隆民主妇女联盟”等民族主义政党，领导人民进行反对殖民统治的斗争。1955年亚非会议以后，喀麦隆民族独立运动开始进入高潮。1955年4月22日，喀麦隆各党派发表联合宣言，要求结束托管制度，建立喀麦隆主权国家。法国殖民当局以疯狂的镇压来回答这一正义要求。几个星期之内，有五千多喀麦隆人民遭到杀害，这就是有名的“5月惨案”。但是，喀麦隆人民并没有被法国这一疯狂行动吓倒，他们在“人民联盟”的领导下，继续开展了争取民族独立和南北两个地区统一的斗争。1956年夏季，这一斗争发展为武装斗争。1957年，这一斗争很快扩及萨纳加海滨和巴萨等地区。去年3、4月间，在巴米来卡地区又爆发了武装起义，参加者达七、八万人。法国当局多次增兵进行镇压，仍然扑灭不了喀麦隆人民武装。喀麦隆人民的有组织的大规模反帝武装斗争因而成了撒哈拉沙漠以南最引人注目的事件。在1957年底举行的亚非人民团结大会、1958年举行的非洲独立国家会议和非洲人民大会上，喀麦隆人民的英勇斗争都得到了广泛的同情和热烈的支援。喀麦隆人民坚持不懈的斗争以及整个非洲的民族独立运动的蓬勃发展，迫使有关方面不得不考虑喀麦隆限期取得独立的问题。去年十月下旬，喀麦隆立法议会以四十六票对七票通过决议，要求1960年1月1日取得完全独立。接着，法国也向联合国托管委员会表示了态度，同意喀麦隆在1960年1月1日“独立”。然而，法国所同意的“独立”，仅仅是在“法国共同体”内的“独立”。在这个“共同体内”，军事、外交等权限仍由法国掌握。英国则以北喀麦隆并入尼日利亚作为取得“独立”的前提。这样，所谓“独立”的喀麦隆还剩下什么东西能够由自己处理呢？
    这样的“独立”的政府，和今天的所谓喀麦隆“自治政府”在实质上能够找出多大的区别呢？
    法国当局的伪善的面貌在喀麦隆的实际斗争中，很快就被揭露了，军事镇压活动仍然在疯狂地进行着。驻在喀麦隆的八万多法国殖民军不仅没有减少，而且在刚果人民爆发反对殖民统治斗争后，立即有了加强。六万多喀麦隆人民仍然被关在狱中或集中营里，遭受着百般虐待。得到广大人民拥护的民族主义政党“喀麦隆人民联盟”，今天仍然被宣布为“非法”。其他民族主义政党也不断受到殖民当局的迫害。在广阔的喀麦隆领土上，找不到任何迹象足以说明法国愿意在几个月后放弃它在这里的殖民统治。
    在联合国内，法国和英国的伪善面貌也是十分露骨的。它们在口头上宣称“同意”喀麦隆在1960年独立，但是，在表决任何有利于托管地民族独立运动的提案时，它们却又无例外地坚决加以反对。去年11月间，联合国托管委员会关于喀麦隆前途问题的讨论中，英法两国坚决反对社会主义国家和亚非国家提出的喀麦隆独立步骤的主张。法国所持的
  “理由”是在听取联合国派往喀麦隆的代表团的报告以后，才能讨论喀麦隆独立的实质问题。英国甚至荒谬地以雨季作为“理由”，反对今年在喀麦隆举行公民投票。
    英法两国的顽固态度得到了美国的支持和庇护。美国在联合国托管委员会上无例外地和英法站在一起反对社会主义国家和亚非国家就喀麦隆问题提出的任何积极性的建议。不仅如此，在联合国派往喀麦隆的代表团中，美国也起了极其恶劣的作用，尽力粉饰英法在喀麦隆的血腥统治。1955年有美国代表参加的联合国代表团到达喀麦隆的时候，法国当局正成千上万地屠杀喀麦隆人民，甚至是当着联合国代表团的面干这种罪行，但是，在代表团的报告中，却绝口不谈这些情况。去年秋天，以美国为首的联合国代表团又去喀麦隆视察。这个代表团在今年1月30日发表了一个报告，对于制止英法两国的军事镇压和政治迫害、撤退英法军队等独立以前的重大问题避而不谈，反而提出了永远分裂喀麦隆南北两个地区的建议。这份报告显然是符合英法殖民者的愿望的。据喀麦隆人民联盟揭露，联合国代表团的负责人美国代表格里格曾经和喀麦隆的某些人物进行多次密谈，以便今后进一步扩张美国在喀麦隆的利益和势力。显然，这正是美国一贯在喀麦隆问题上支持英法的真正目的。
    喀麦隆人民联盟和广大人民早已一再宣布，在实现独立以前，必须做到：一、立即撤退英法军队和宪兵；二、立即停止一切政治迫害；三、保证一切言论和政治活动自由；四、立即释放一切被捕者。因为只有这样，喀麦隆人民才有可能自由地表达他们自己的意见，选择他们所需要的政府和决定有关实现独立的重大问题。
    喀麦隆人民为了摆脱殖民统治，取得民族独立，曾经进行了长期的斗争。近三年来，喀麦隆民族革命力量又在火热的武装斗争中锻炼和壮大了自己。五千多名爱国志士在武装斗争中为民族独立事业贡献出了自己的生命。帝国主义的政治欺骗和血腥镇压都不能改变喀麦隆人民争取独立的决心。在社会主义国家和亚非国家的积极支持下，喀麦隆人民必将在自己的道路上继续奋勇前进。并在不久的将来永远根除强加在他们头上的殖民统治。
