Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 31st. At the afternoon session of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on January 31, the heads of the delegations of the Communist Parties of Germany, Austria, Britain, Denmark, Norway, and Japan delivered congratulatory messages to the Congress. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by the attendees.

    First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, Max Reimann, on behalf of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party and all its members, sent fraternal combat greetings to the delegates of the Congress and the heroic Soviet people of all nationalities.

    In his congratulatory message, he said that the great plans discussed at this Congress will help us in the Federal Republic of Germany to clearly point out to the masses the peaceful aims of the Soviet Union and socialist countries, and to make the people of the Federal Republic of Germany understand that the Soviet Union is a friend of all peoples, including the German people, while the enemies of the German people are the German imperialists and militarists who are creating the threat of a third world war. Comrade Reimann said that the vast majority of residents of the Federal Republic of Germany want peace and oppose the preparation for atomic war.

    Comrade Reimann concluded by saying that the Adenauer government has banned the Communist Party, but our party, despite this ban, is living and fighting.

    Chairman of the Austrian Communist Party, Koplenig, said in his congratulatory message that the Austrian Communists and the broad masses of working people unanimously praise the achievements made by the Soviet people of all nationalities in recent years.

    The Soviet Union is winning victory after victory in large-scale economic construction, while signs of economic crisis in the capitalist world are increasingly intensifying. The number of unemployed in Austria is constantly increasing, and they now account for about 10% of the total number of employees.

    Comrade Koplenig said that the great victories achieved by the Soviet Union on the road to communism have convinced the working people of the world that the capitalist era is coming to an end, and the victorious advance of socialism is irresistible.

    Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Pollitt, on behalf of the Communist Party of Great Britain, sent a congratulatory message to the Congress, saying: We have seen the great progress your country has made in all fields of work since the 20th Congress. The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will be a new step forward for the Soviet people and will be a source of hope and encouragement for the international workers' movement, especially the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries.

    Comrade Pollitt said that the Soviet Union has convincingly proved that socialism is superior to capitalism. We sincerely thank you for all that you have done and will do in the future, especially for the great victory you achieved over fascism and for your contribution to the cause of maintaining lasting peace. We wish you success in all your initiatives, because we know that the realization of these initiatives will not only benefit you but also the workers of the whole world.

    Chairman of the Communist Party of Denmark, Knud Jespersen, said in his congratulatory message that the 21st Congress of the CPSU marks a new and decisive stage in the economic competition between the two world systems.

    Jespersen recalled that the Communist Party of Denmark held its 20th Congress not long ago. Before the congress, the party had been subjected to a frenzied attack by revisionists who opposed the internationalist stance and attempted to lead the party away from the path of Marxism-Leninism. The Congress reaffirmed by an absolute majority that the Communist Party of Denmark supports the declaration of the Moscow meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of November 1957. Comrade Jespersen said that after strengthening the unity of its ranks, our party is now mobilizing all its forces to solve the tasks it faces.

    Chairman of the Communist Party of Norway, Emil Lovlien, said in his congratulatory message that although the Norwegian Social Democratic Party has been in power for many years and has a majority in parliament, domestic capital rule has not only not been eliminated but has intensified. Because Norway has joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it has been left to the mercy of Western imperialist forces. The Norwegian people are watching with great anxiety the revival of revanchist German militarism headed by Hitler's generals.

    Comrade Lovlien emphasized that the main task of the Communist Party of Norway at present is to establish the unity of workers on a class basis. To safeguard the urgent demands of the working class and to win the struggle for peace, united action of the working class is absolutely necessary.

    Comrade Lovlien finally warmly congratulated the 21st Congress and the Soviet people, and wished the Soviet people success in completing the seven-year plan.

    General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Japan, Kenji Miyamoto, congratulated the delegates to the Congress in his congratulatory message. He said that the members of our party and all peace fighters are watching the 21st Congress of the CPSU with great hope. We are convinced that the Congress will play a prominent historical role in strengthening world peace, developing the world socialist system, and in the great cause of the victorious construction of communism in the Soviet Union.

    苏联人民向前迈出新的一步
    全世界工人阶级都受到鼓舞
    德奥英丹挪日共产党代表祝贺苏共代表大会
    新华社莫斯科31日电　在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会1月31日下午会议上，德国共产党、奥地利共产党、英国共产党、丹麦共产党、挪威共产党、日本共产党的代表团团长向代表大会致了贺词。他们的讲话受到了到会者的热烈欢迎。
    德国共产党中央委员会第一书记马克斯·雷曼代表德国共产党中央委员会及其全体党员向代表大会的代表们及英勇的苏联各族人民致兄弟般的战斗敬礼。
    他在贺词中说，这次代表大会上所讨论的伟大计划将帮助我们在德意志联邦共和国向群众清楚地指出苏联和社会主义各国的和平目的，让德意志联邦共和国的人民了解，苏联是各国人民，也是德国人民的朋友，而德国人民的敌人则是制造第三次世界大战威胁的德国帝国主义者和军国主义者们。雷曼同志说，德意志联邦共和国的绝大多数居民希望和平并反对准备原子战争。
    雷曼同志最后说，阿登纳政府禁止共产党，但是我们党不顾这种禁令，正在生活着和斗争着。
    奥地利共产党主席柯普勒尼希致贺词时说，奥地利共产党人和广大的劳动人民一致赞扬苏联各族人民近几年来所获得的成就。
    苏联在大规模的经济建设中节节胜利，而资本主义世界的经济危机迹象却在日益加剧。奥地利的失业人数在不断增加，他们现在约占全体职工人数的10％。
    柯普勒尼希同志说，苏联在共产主义道路上取得的巨大胜利使全世界劳动人民相信，资本主义时代行将结束，而社会主义的胜利前进则是不可阻挡的。
    英国共产党执行委员会主席波立特同志代表英国共产党向代表大会致贺词时说，我们看到了你们国家在第二十次代表大会以后在各方面工作的一切领域中都获得了伟大的进展。苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会将是苏联人民向前迈出的新的一步，将是国际工人运动，特别是各国共产党和工人党的希望和鼓舞的源泉。
    波立特同志说，苏联令人信服地证实了社会主义比资本主义优越。我们衷心地感谢你们过去已完成的和今后还要完成的一切，特别是感谢你们对法西斯取得的伟大胜利和对维护持久和平事业作出的贡献。我们祝你们的一切创举都获得成功，因为我们知道，这些创举的实现，不仅会造福于你们，也会造福于全世界的工人。
    丹麦共产党主席克努德·耶斯佩森在贺词中说，苏共第二十一次代表大会标志着两个世界体系的经济竞赛进入一个新的决定性阶段。
    耶斯佩森回顾说，丹麦共产党不久前举行了第二十次代表大会。在代表大会召开之前，党曾经受到了修正主义者的疯狂进攻，他们反对国际主义立场，企图使党离开马克思列宁主义道路。代表大会以绝对多数票重申丹麦共产党拥护1957年11月各国共产党和工人党代表的莫斯科会议的宣言。耶斯佩森同志说，我们党在加强自己队伍的团结以后，现在正动员一切力量解决它所面临的任务。
    挪威共产党主席埃米尔·洛夫林同志在贺词中说，尽管挪威社会民主党已经执政多年并且在议会中拥有多数，但是国内的资本统治不仅没有消除，反而变本加厉了。由于挪威参加了北大西洋公约，它已听任西方帝国主义势力的摆布。挪威人民极其不安地注视着以希特勒将领为首的复仇主义的德国军国主义的复活。
    洛夫林同志强调指出，挪威共产党当前的主要任务是在阶级的基础上建立工人的统一。要维护工人阶级的迫切要求和胜利进行争取和平的斗争，工人阶级的统一行动是绝对必要的。
    洛夫林同志最后热烈祝贺第二十一次代表大会和苏联人民，并祝苏联人民在完成七年计划中获得成就。
    日本共产党中央委员会总书记宫本显治同志在贺词中祝贺大会代表。他说，我们党的党员和全体和平战士抱着极大的希望注视着苏共第二十一次代表大会。我们确信，代表大会在加强世界和平、发展世界社会主义体系和在苏联胜利建设共产主义的伟大事业中定将起卓越的历史作用。
