    Seize the Present, Plan for the Whole Year
    Shanghai Machine Tool Plant Takes Measures to Strive for a Twofold Increase in Production Capacity in the Second Half of the Year
    (Our newspaper's Shanghai dispatch, February 2nd) The workers of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant have launched a vigorous mass movement centered on expanding production capacity, striving to increase the plant's production capacity by more than two times in the third quarter of this year. This will enable them to undertake the exceptionally heavy tasks in the second half of the year and ensure the completion of the year's leap forward plan.
    This nationally renowned machine tool plant doubled its production last year compared to the year before. This year, on the basis of last year's expansion, it will double again and will also trial-produce more than twenty new high-precision grinder products. According to the preliminary arrangements for the year's production and the supply of raw materials, it is estimated that the tasks in the third and fourth quarters will increase more than two times compared to the first quarter. If measures are not taken early, a situation will inevitably arise where production capacity cannot adapt. The Party Committee analyzed this new situation and proposed to the plant's workers: give full play to people's subjective initiative and change the potentially "loose at the beginning and tight at the end" situation. In addition to seizing the current production, they also mobilized the plant's workers to summarize last year's work, make full use of last year's experience, and actively expand the plant's production capacity rapidly from equipment, technology and other aspects.
    The workers first addressed the potential shortage of equipment capacity by launching a movement to build indigenous machine tools on a large scale. The hydraulic workshop is manufacturing a deep-hole drilling machine more than six meters long, which can free up the two ocean lathes currently used to make "hydraulic cylinders." The third workshop is modifying a gantry planer, which will increase efficiency by 25% after completion. Currently, workers and technicians throughout the plant are designing and manufacturing a total of more than twenty large indigenous machine tools.
    Insufficient casting capacity is the weakest link in the plant's production. Now, the plant is starting to change the manual casting operation to mechanization, which can double the output.
    Adopting a method of combining leading cadres, workers, and technicians to streamline product structure was an important factor in the rapid increase in the plant's production efficiency last year. Now, in addition to sorting out the products that have been streamlined last year and putting them into mass production, the workers will also carry out this work in a more planned and extensive manner. Recently, another streamlined universal grinder will soon be manufactured in batches. After streamlining this grinder, raw materials are saved by more than 20%, costs are reduced by more than 30%, man-hours are reduced by more than 40%, and the number of parts is reduced by more than 50%, while the performance is exactly the same as the original. Currently, the plant is also adjusting the production organization according to the new characteristics of this year's production to make it more reasonable in order to improve labor productivity.
    In view of the large tasks this year and the fact that many are high-end products, the plant has also launched a mass upsurge of learning technology and improving technology. The assembly group in the hydraulic workshop has already begun to study the theory of hydraulic transmission. The second workshop has gathered more than twenty excellent workers, and engineers give them special technical theory classes every day. Various workshops also use mass movement methods to systematically train the large number of new apprentices so that they can operate independently as soon as possible.
    In order to have more sufficient raw materials to complete this year's leap forward plan, the workers are also relying on their own efforts to manufacture raw materials. They have already begun to use indigenous furnaces to make coke, and use regenerative furnaces to smelt indigenous iron from various places and scrap iron from the plant into pig iron for casting. Small electric furnaces are smelting silicon iron, simple indigenous kilns are producing cement, and the motor workshop set up in the old factory building is busy manufacturing motors.

### 抓紧当前　安排全年  上海机床厂采取措施力争下半年生产能力提高两倍

    抓紧当前　安排全年
    上海机床厂采取措施力争下半年生产能力提高两倍
    本报上海2日电　上海机床厂职工掀起了一个以扩大生产能力为中心的轰轰烈烈的群众运动，力争在今年第三季度内，把全厂生产能力提高两倍以上。这样就能够担负起下半年异常繁重的任务，确保全年跃进计划的完成。
    这个全国著名的机床厂，去年的生产比前年翻了一番，今年在去年扩大了的基础上还要再翻一番，并且还要试制二十多种精密度很高的磨床新产品。根据全年生产的初步安排和原材料供应情况，预计三、四季度的任务都将比一季度增长两倍以上，如不及早采取措施，必将出现生产能力不能适应的局面。党委会分析了这个新形势，向全厂职工提出：充分发挥人的主观能动性，改变可能出现的“前松后紧”的局面。除了抓紧当前的生产以外，他们还发动全厂职工群众总结去年的工作，充分运用去年的经验，积极从设备、技术等方面迅速扩大全厂的生产能力。
    职工们首先针对将出现设备能力不足的情况，展开了大搞土机床的运动。液压车间正在制造一台长达六公尺多的深孔钻床，可以把现在专做“油压筒”的两台大洋车床解放出来。第三车间正在改装一台龙门刨床，完成后效率可提高25％。目前，全厂工人和技术人员正在设计制造的大型土机床共有二十多台。
    铸造能力不足，是全厂生产最薄弱的环节。现在，厂里正在动手把铸造的手工操作改为机械化，产量可以提高一倍。
    采用领导干部、工人和技术人员三结合的方式精简产品结构，是去年全厂生产效率所以能迅速提高的重要因素。现在，职工们除了把去年已精简过的产品加以整理成批投入生产外，并且将更有计划更广泛地开展这一工作。最近又有一种精简过的万能磨床马上就要成批制造。这种磨床精简以后，原材料节约20％多，成本降低30％多，工时减少40％多，零件数量减少50％多，而性能完全同原来的一样。目前，全厂还根据今年生产的新特点，调整生产组织，使之更加合理，以提高劳动生产率。
    鉴于今年的任务大，而且有很多是高级产品，全厂还掀起了一个群众性的学习技术、提高技术的热潮。液压车间装配小组已经开始学习液压传动的理论。第二车间集中了二十多个优秀工人，由工程师每天专门给他们上技术理论课。各个车间还运用群众运动的方法，系统地培养新进厂的大批艺徒，使他们能尽快独立操作。
    为了有更充足的原材料来完成今年的跃进计划，职工们还自力更生、自造原材料。他们已经开始用土炉炼焦，并且用再生炉把各地来的土铁和本厂的废铁屑炼成铸造用的生铁。小电炉正在冶炼矽铁，简易的土窑正在生产水泥，利用旧厂房办的马达车间正在忙着制造马达。　　（贺昌华）（附图片）
