Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, February 14th: Over the past eight years, the People's Liberation Army troops and Tibetan and Han cadres working in the Ali region of western Tibet, which is more than 4,000 meters above sea level, have overcome various difficulties and have been self-reliant in continuously bringing about new changes in the face of the Ali Plateau.

In some places where only wild animals roamed for thousands of years, the People's Liberation Army troops and Tibetan and Han cadres started from scratch to carry out production and construction, building more than 7,000 square meters of new houses. Lacking wood, they found ways to use shrub branches instead; lacking bricks and tiles, they used stones and adobe. New settlements have now emerged in the barren mountains and remote areas they have passed through. Garkonsha, a new settlement, has been built on the banks of the Gar River, where there was not even a single herdsman's tent eight years ago. Hundreds of houses have sprung up on the flat ground, and banks, post and telecommunications bureaus, trading companies, and hospitals have been established.

On the Ali Plateau, where snowy mountains overlap, transportation in the past relied entirely on mules and pack sheep. After liberation, more than 2,500 kilometers of highways and motor vehicle tracks were built, greatly improving transportation conditions. The famous Xinjiang Highway and the Heihe-Ali line, which will soon be completed as a formal highway, have made the connection between Ali and other regions closer. The Gada Ke-Pulan Zong Highway, which runs through the territory, connects the vast pastoral and agricultural areas of Ali, facilitating the exchange of agricultural and pastoral products.

The vast Ali Plateau had no hospitals and no doctors before liberation, but now medical institutions have been established. People who have suffered from plagues and diseases for generations can now receive free medical treatment from the state. In the past, the vast number of farmers and herdsmen in Ali never had the opportunity to go to school, but now some young people from farming and herding families have been sent to schools in Beijing and other inland cities to study.

The People's Liberation Army troops and Tibetan and Han cadres in the Ali region have carried out creative labor in agricultural production. At the foot of snowy mountains where no grains had ever grown, they reclaimed thousands of acres of fertile land and successfully trial-planted many kinds of crops. In recent years, they have produced their own grain and vegetables, which has not only reduced the burden on the state but also solved the difficulties of some of the local people. Soon, an experimental farm, with soldiers and cadres taking turns to participate in production, will begin land reclamation and production at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains.

In order to help the local people develop production, the Ali Sub-Committee of the CPC has done a lot of work in the past eight years. A large number of farmers, herdsmen, and handicraft workers throughout the region have received state loans and food, and some poor households have also received free relief. The Sub-Committee organized forces to purchase local specialty products that had long been unsalable at reasonable prices, and at the same time supplied some daily necessities transported from the mainland to the rural and pastoral areas at low prices. The People's Liberation Army soldiers often carry out voluntary labor, repairing bridges and roads, building canals and reservoirs, and helping farmers and herdsmen with various kinds of labor, which has played a good role in production.

### 荒山僻野建起大批房屋　雪山脚下开出千亩良田  西藏阿里地区一片新兴景象

    荒山僻野建起大批房屋　雪山脚下开出千亩良田  
    西藏阿里地区一片新兴景象
    新华社拉萨14日电　在拔海四千公尺以上的西藏西部阿里地区工作的人民解放军部队和藏、汉族干部，八年来战胜了各种困难，自力更生地使阿里高原的面貌不断发生新的变化。
    在一些千百年来只有野兽出没的地方，人民解放军部队和藏、汉族干部，白手起家进行生产建设，盖起了七千多平方公尺新房屋。没有木材，他们想办法用灌木条代替；没有砖瓦，他们就改用石块和土坯。在他们走过的荒山僻野，现在出现了新的居民点。八年前连一顶牧人帐篷都没有的噶尔河畔，现在建成了新的居民点噶尔昆沙，平地耸起了几百间房屋，开办了银行、邮电局、贸易公司和医院等。
    雪山重叠的阿里高原上，过去运输完全靠骡马和驮羊。解放后修建了二千五百多公里的公路和汽车便道，大大改善了运输状况。著名的新疆公路和即将修成正式公路的黑河—阿里线路，使阿里和外区的联系密切了。纵贯境内的噶大克—普兰宗公路，把阿里辽阔的牧区和农业区连接起来，便利了农牧产品的交流。
    地区辽阔的阿里高原，解放以前没有一所医院，找不到一个医生，现在已成立了医疗机构。祖祖辈辈遭受瘟疫和疾病磨折的人们，今天可以得到国家的免费治疗。阿里广大农牧民过去从没有上学念书的机会，现在有些农牧民的青年子弟被保送到北京和其他内地城市的学校里学习。
    阿里地区人民解放军部队和藏、汉族干部，在农业生产方面进行了创造性的劳动。他们在从来没有长过五谷的雪山脚下，开垦出几千亩良田，试种成功许多种农作物。几年来，他们自己生产粮食和蔬菜，不仅减轻了国家的负担，还解决了当地部分人民的困难。不久，一个由战士和干部轮流参加生产的试验农场，就要在昆仑山下开始垦荒生产。
    为了帮助当地人民发展生产，八年来，中共阿里分工委做了许多工作。全区有很大数量的农户、牧户和手工业者都得到了国家的贷粮和贷款，部分贫穷户还得到了无偿的救济。分工委组织力量到各地用合理的价格收购长期没有出路的土特产品，同时将内地运来的一些生活用品廉价地供应给农村和牧区。人民解放军战士经常进行义务劳动，修桥补路，建造水渠、水库，帮助农牧民从事各种劳动，对生产起了很好的作用。
