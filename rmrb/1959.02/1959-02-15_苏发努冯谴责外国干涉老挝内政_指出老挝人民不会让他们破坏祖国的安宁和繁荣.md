Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 13th: Vientiane dispatch: The Lao "Patriotic News" published on January 10th a conversation between Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Patriotic Party, and a reporter from the newspaper. In this conversation, Souphanouvong condemned foreign interference in Lao internal affairs.

In response to a question about the characteristics of the Lao situation in the past year, Souphanouvong said: In the past year, the Lao situation has undergone historical developments: the cessation of mutual slaughter; the unification of the Lao people to form a coalition government; the holding of free supplementary elections with the participation of various parties nationwide; the promulgation of legislation guaranteeing the people's democratic freedoms, etc. These victories made the Lao people very happy and proved that we have the ability to determine our own destiny.

However, some foreigners and Lao people have tried to hinder our progress, attempting to undermine the peace of our people. They spread rumors, sow discord among the Lao people, slander parties and individuals who support a policy of peace and neutrality, sabotage the coalition government, discriminate against, retaliate against, arrest, imprison, and even kill patriotic people, trample on the people's democratic freedoms, and depreciate the value of the Lao currency. The above-mentioned circumstances have greatly affected national harmony and the people's lives, hindering the Lao people from taking the road of peace and neutrality, and making Laos more subordinate to foreign countries. As a result, the Lao people's material and spiritual lives are becoming increasingly impoverished, and Laos' financial and economic situation is deteriorating.

The cause of all these situations is the increasingly deep interference of certain foreigners in Laos. This interference makes some Lao politicians afraid to freely implement a policy of peace and neutrality that conforms to the wishes of the Lao people.

In response to a question about how the Lao Patriotic Party treats the above-mentioned situation, Souphanouvong said: The Lao Patriotic Party has cooperated with parties and individuals who support a policy of peace and neutrality, especially in the National Assembly meetings. The Patriotic Party has cooperated with patriotic parliamentarians to conduct reasoned struggles against policies that do not conform to the national interest. It has also written many official letters requesting the government to resolve the issues raised over the years, and has also written to the International Commission. However, until now, the Lao Patriotic Party's reasonable suggestions have not been addressed. On the contrary, some people have spread rumors, making many solvable problems unsolvable, and creating more difficulties. Despite this, the Lao Patriotic Party is not discouraged. At any time, the Lao Patriotic Party is willing to work with the army, police, youth, staff, officials, and people from all walks of life who love the motherland and peace, to lead the motherland onto a bright and splendid path.

Souphanouvong, when talking about the prospects for the Lao situation in 1959, said: 1959 has many favorable conditions that can help us consolidate national harmony, improve people's lives, and strive to build the motherland. He said, but we will also encounter many difficulties. Because certain foreigners and Lao people are unwilling to see Laos at peace, they are working hard to promote the realization of their plans. Specifically, they continue to discriminate against, retaliate against, and suppress patriots, strengthen slanderous propaganda and spread rumors, sow discord among the Lao people, and create chaos on Lao soil. At the same time, they are looking for opportunities to amend the new election law, restrict the people's universal and direct suffrage, attempt to promulgate the so-called "Law Against Actions Threatening the Kingdom," and prepare to dissolve the National Assembly, etc. Long ago, they created an atmosphere in public opinion in order to do these things. And the purpose of these things is to establish a dictatorship and restore us to our original backward state. But whether they can do it is another matter. Because the Lao people, including patriotic politicians, parliamentarians, officials, staff, the army, the police, and people from all walks of life, all hope for national peace and prosperity. Our policy conforms to the wishes of the people. Although our country is encountering temporary difficulties, the international situation has become relatively stable, those who specialize in interfering and disrupting in various countries are suffering more and more failures, and the forces in the world that love the motherland and peace are growing stronger. Therefore, if we unite into a strong force and resolutely oppose the above-mentioned conspiracies, then those people's conspiracies will certainly not succeed, and the Lao people will surely achieve final victory.

### 苏发努冯谴责外国干涉老挝内政  指出老挝人民不会让他们破坏祖国的安宁和繁荣

    苏发努冯谴责外国干涉老挝内政
    指出老挝人民不会让他们破坏祖国的安宁和繁荣  
    新华社河内13日电　万象消息：老挝“爱国报”在1月10日发表了老挝爱国党领袖苏发努冯亲王对这家报纸的记者所发表的谈话。苏发努冯在这次谈话中谴责外国干涉老挝内政。
    在回答过去一年老挝局势有什么特点的问题时，苏发努冯说：过去一年中，老挝局势有了历史性的发展：制止了互相残杀的局面；老挝人联合起来，成立了联合政府；在全国范围内举行了有各党派参加的自由的补充选举；颁布了保证人民民主自由权的法案等。这些胜利使老挝人民很高兴，证明了我们有决定自己命运的能力。
    但是，有一些外国人和老挝人，曾经竭力阻碍我们前进，企图破坏我们人民的安宁，他们造谣生事，离间老挝人，诽谤赞成和平中立政策的党派和人士；破坏联合政府；歧视、报复、逮捕、监禁、甚至杀害爱国人民；蹂躏人民的民主自由权利；贬低老挝币值。上述情况，大大影响了民族的和睦和人民的生活，阻碍老挝人民走上和平中立的道路，使老挝更加附属于外国。因而，老挝人民的物质和精神生活日益贫困，老挝的财政经济状况日益恶化。
    造成所有这些情况的原因，是某些外国人日益深入地干涉老挝，这种干涉使老挝的一些政治家不敢自由地执行符合老挝人民愿望的和平中立政策。
    在回答老挝爱国党怎样对待上述情况的问题时，苏发努冯说：老挝爱国党曾经同赞成和平中立政策的各党派和人士合作，尤其是在国会会议上，爱国党曾经同爱国议员合作，为反对不符合国家利益的政策而进行说理斗争，还写了许多公函，要求政府解决几年里所提出的问题，同时也写信告诉国际委员会。但是直到现在，老挝爱国党的合情合理的建议没有得到处理，相反地有人还造谣生事，使许多可以解决的问题不能解决，而且造成更多的困难。尽管如此，老挝爱国党仍然不灰心。无论什么时候，老挝爱国党都愿意同爱祖国、爱和平的军队、警察、青年、职员、官吏以及各阶层人民一起，把祖国引上光明灿烂的道路。
    苏发努冯在谈到1959年老挝局势的展望时说：1959年有许多有利的条件，可以帮助我们巩固民族的和睦，改善人民生活和努力建设祖国。他说，但是我们也将遇到许多困难。因为某些外国人和老挝人不愿意老挝安宁，正在努力促进他们的计划的实现，具体地说，就是继续歧视、报复和镇压爱国者，加强诽谤性的宣传和造谣生事，离间老挝人，并且在老挝的土地上制造纷乱，同时，伺机修改新选举法，限制人民的普遍和直接的投票权，企图颁布所谓“反对威胁王国的行动”法案，准备解散国民议会等。很久以前，他们就为了做到这些事情而在舆论界制造气氛。而这些事情的目的在于建立一个独裁制度，使我们恢复原来的落后状况。但是他们能否办得到，又是另一回事了。因为老挝人民，其中包括爱国的政治家、国会议员、官吏、职员、军队、警察以至各阶层人民，都希望国家安宁和繁荣。我们的政策符合人民的愿望。虽然我国正在遭遇到暂时的困难，但是国际局势已经相对稳定，专门在各国进行干涉和捣乱的人日益遭到更多的失败，世界上爱祖国、爱和平的力量日益强大。因此，如果我们团结成一股坚强的力量，同时坚决反对上述阴谋，那么，那些人的阴谋一定不能得逞，而老挝人民一定取得最后胜利。
