Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 2nd: At the afternoon session of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on February 2nd, the heads of the delegations from the Algerian Communist Party, the Moroccan Communist Party, the Argentine Communist Party, and the Uruguayan Communist Party delivered congratulatory speeches to the Congress. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by the attendees.

	Rabi Bouhali, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Algerian Communist Party, delivered congratulations on behalf of the Algerian Communist Party and the Algerian people to the Congress. He said it can be believed that you will certainly be able to complete the Seven-Year Plan, just as you completed the previous Five-Year Plans. The Algerian people believe that the realization of the Seven-Year Plan will not only mean the victory of the Soviet Union, but also the victory of the entire socialist camp. This victory will point out the path to peace and progress for the people of all countries.

	Bouhali then pointed out that the war imposed on Algeria by the French government has caused many sacrifices. The new French government also frantically hopes to drown the Algerian people's desire for freedom and independence in blood. The Algerian government, temporarily located in a neutral country, has constantly suggested that the French government start negotiations on the entire Algerian issue.

	Bouhali continued, the American imperialists and other imperialists of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are helping the French colonialists. But the Algerian people are filled with firm determination to have their rights to independence and autonomy recognized. They know that their just cause is supported by all forces of peace.

	Bouhali said that the Algerian Communists participated in the national struggle, and they are patriots. They do not deviate from the principles of internationalism in the slightest. The Algerian Communist Party firmly condemns modern revisionism as the main danger, and resolutely fights against sectarianism and dogmatism in its own ranks.

	Ali Yata, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Moroccan Communist Party, said in his congratulatory speech, "We have no doubt that the results of the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan will further strengthen the power of your great country, a power that already makes the enemies of peace, democracy, and progress tremble." Your Seven-Year Plan is a great encouragement to the people of all countries striving to break the shackles of slavery. Yata, when talking about the heroic struggle and work of the Moroccan Communists, pointed out that the Moroccan Communists strive to unite all patriotic forces in the country to combat the conspiracies of imperialism.

	Yata emphasized that the war in Algeria must be ended, and France must be forced to negotiate with the government of Algeria, which is fighting. He said: "This is the task of our country and the task of all progressive humanity."

	Yata said that the Moroccan Communists are active supporters of the Arab people in the struggle against the common enemy, imperialism. We also consistently fight for the unity of the African people. He said, we are struggling under difficult conditions, but we believe in our own strength because your glorious achievements support us.

	H. A. Álvarez, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Argentine Communist Party, said in his congratulatory speech that the socialist achievements of your country in forty-one years of heroic struggle have strengthened the working people's belief in the enormous creative power of the socialist system. The victorious completion of the resolutions of your historically significant congress will be a very valuable support to countries like ours, which are struggling to defend their national independence and to strive for progress, prosperity, and peace.

	Álvarez continued, imperialism, which is falling apart due to numerous contradictions, is struggling in vain to get rid of the crisis and intensifying its attacks on the national independence of South American countries. However, we can say that despite the betrayal of the motherland by some rulers, the people of Latin American countries will not become the prey of colonialists. Álvarez said that no force can stop the struggle of our working class and people to protect economic independence, defend national progress, and safeguard peace. Our party holds high the banner of the people's and national demands and spares no effort to strive for the unity of the working class and the concerted action of all popular forces.

	Arismendi, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Uruguayan Communist Party, delivered a congratulatory speech to the Congress on behalf of the Uruguayan Communist Party.

	When talking about the significance of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, Arismendi said that the lofty goal of the working class—the establishment of communism—has been put forward by the Soviet Union as a direct practical task for contemporary Soviet people. He continued, in terms of ideology, your congress has dealt a fatal blow to all kinds of revisionism, and you have made a correct and critical assessment of the methods of the Yugoslav leaders.

	Arismendi then said that our people have achieved many accomplishments. They have defended their rights and freedoms, promoted the development of friendly relations and trade ties with socialist countries, and carried out a series of anti-imperialist struggles, especially reclaiming the slaughterhouse and cold storage from the hands of American imperialism.

	Arismendi said that our party leads the struggle of the working people, thus enhancing its prestige among the working class and the entire people. However, huge tasks still lie before us. Inspired by your 21st Congress, we will strive to improve our work in building the Uruguayan working-class party, which is necessary for launching the struggle of the people of Latin American countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 3rd: At the morning session of the 21st Congress of the CPSU on February 3rd, Muhammad Ennafaa, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Tunisian Communist Party, addressed the Congress on behalf of the Tunisian Communist Party.

	He said that the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy is a plan for your great victory and an outstanding proof of the vigorous Marxist-Leninist doctrine. Ennafaa said that your achievements inspire us and give us new strength.

	Ennafaa continued, the Tunisian people, who have suffered all kinds of colonial oppression, although they have achieved success in the struggle for independence, know that this struggle is not over yet. The fraternal Algerian people are still continuing their war for independence.

	Ennafaa said that as long as Tunisia's foreign policy relies on the West, Tunisia cannot achieve its goals, nor can it make its own contribution to solving the most important Algerian issue. In this case, the necessity of strengthening relations between Tunisia and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly clear.

	We want to say to those who accuse us Communists of believing in socialism: please show us even one capitalist country that can help Arab countries strive for independence like the Soviet Union! Ennafaa said, I wish the Soviet people success in completing the Seven-Year Plan, and I believe you will succeed.

	Ennafaa's speech was warmly welcomed by the delegates.

    阿尔及利亚等国兄弟党向大会致词
    苏联威力使和平的敌人发抖  七年计划鼓舞被压迫的人民
    新华社莫斯科2日电　在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会2日下午会议上，阿尔及利亚共产党、摩洛哥共产党、阿根廷共产党和乌拉圭共产党的代表团团长向大会致了贺词。他们的讲话受到了到会者的热烈欢迎。
    阿尔及利亚共产党中央委员会第一书记拉比·布哈利代表阿尔及利亚共产党和阿尔及利亚人民向代表大会致贺。他说，可以相信，你们一定能够完成七年计划，正如你们完成了前几个五年计划一样。阿尔及利亚人民相信，实现七年计划将不仅意味着苏联的胜利，而且意味着整个社会主义阵营的胜利。这个胜利将向世界各国人民指出通向和平和进步的道路。
    布哈利接着指出，法国政府强加给阿尔及利亚的战争已经造成了很多牺牲。法国新政府也疯狂地指望把阿尔及利亚人争取自由和独立的愿望淹没在血泊中。暂设在中立国家的阿尔及利亚政府不断地建议法国政府就整个阿尔及利亚问题开始谈判。
    布哈利接着说，美帝国主义者和北大西洋公约组织的其他帝国主义者都在帮助法国殖民主义者。但是阿尔及利亚人民充满坚定的决心，争取使他们的独立和自主的权利得到承认。他们知道，他们的正义事业得到所有和平力量的支持。
    布哈利说，阿尔及利亚共产党人参加了全民斗争，他们是爱国者。他们一步也不离开国际主义的原则。阿尔及利亚共产党坚决谴责作为主要危险的现代修正主义，并且同自己队伍中的宗派主义和教条主义进行坚决斗争。
    摩洛哥共产党中央委员会第一书记阿里·亚塔致贺词时说，我们毫不怀疑，七年计划执行的结果，将使你们的伟大国家的威力更加增强，这种威力现在已经使和平、民主和进步的敌人发抖。你们的七年计划是对争取打碎奴役枷锁的各国人民的巨大鼓舞。亚塔谈到摩洛哥共产党人的英勇斗争和工作时指出，摩洛哥共产党人努力团结国内的一切爱国力量来打击帝国主义的阴谋。
    亚塔强调说，必须结束阿尔及利亚的战争，迫使法国同斗争中的阿尔及利亚的政府谈判。他说：这是我国的任务，也是全体进步人类的任务。
    亚塔说，摩洛哥共产党人是阿拉伯人民在反对共同敌人帝国主义的斗争中的积极支持者。我们也一贯为非洲人民的团结而斗争。他说，我们是在困难的条件下斗争的，但是我们相信自己的力量，因为你们的辉煌成就支持着我们。
    阿根廷共产党中央委员会总书记赫·阿·阿尔瓦雷斯致贺词说，在四十一年的英勇斗争中，你们国家所取得的社会主义卓越成就，加强了劳动人民对社会主义制度巨大创造能力的信念。胜利地完成你们具有历史意义的代表大会的决议，将是对我们这样一些国家非常宝贵的支持，我们这些国家正在为捍卫本国民族独立，争取进步、繁荣与和平而进行斗争。
    阿尔瓦雷斯接着说，由于重重矛盾而陷于分崩离析的帝国主义，徒劳无益地在挣扎摆脱危机，加紧进攻南美国家的民族独立。但是，我们可以说，尽管某些统治者背叛祖国，拉丁美洲各国人民是不会成为殖民主义者猎获物的。阿尔瓦雷斯说，任何力量也不能阻挠我们工人阶级和人民为保护经济独立、捍卫民族进步和维护和平而进行的斗争。我们的党高举着人民的和民族的要求的旗帜，不遗余力地争取工人阶级的团结一致，争取一切人民力量的一致行动。
    乌拉圭共产党中央委员会第一书记阿里斯门迪代表乌拉圭共产党向代表大会致了贺词。
    阿里斯门迪在谈到苏共第二十一次代表大会的意义时说，工人阶级的崇高目标——建立起共产主义——已经被苏联提出作为当代苏联人直接的实际任务。他继续说，在思想意识方面，你们代表大会给形形色色的修正主义以致命的打击，你们对南斯拉夫领导人的手法作出了正确的、批评性的估价。
    阿里斯门迪接着说，我们人民获得了许多成就。他们维护了自己的权利和自由，促进了同社会主义国家友好关系和贸易联系的发展，进行了一系列的反帝斗争，特别是我们从美帝国主义的手中夺回了屠宰冷藏场。
    阿里斯门迪说，我们的党领导着劳动人民的斗争，因而提高了它在工人阶级和全体人民中的威信。但是，在我们面前还摆着巨大的任务。在你们第二十一次代表大会的鼓舞下，我们将力求改进我们建设乌拉圭工人阶级政党的工作，这一工作是展开拉丁美洲各国人民的斗争所必须
  的。
    新华社莫斯科3日电　在苏共第二十一次代表大会3日上午会议上，突尼斯共产党中央委员会第一书记穆罕默德·恩纳法代表突尼斯共产党向代表大会致词。
    他说，苏联发展国民经济七年计划是你们伟大胜利的计划，是生气勃勃的马克思列宁主义学说的出色证明。恩纳法说，你们的成就鼓舞着我们，给我们以新的力量。
    恩纳法接着说，饱尝种种殖民主义压迫的突尼斯人民，尽管在争取独立的斗争已经取得成就，但是他们知道，这个斗争还没有结束。兄弟的阿尔及利亚人民还在继续进行争取独立的战争。
    恩纳法说，只要突尼斯的对外政策指望西方，突尼斯就不能达到自己的目的，也不能对解决最重要的阿尔及利亚问题作出自己的贡献。在这种情况下，加强突尼斯和苏联的关系的必要性就愈来愈清楚了。
    我们要向那些指责我们共产党人信仰社会主义的人说：请你们给我们指出哪怕是一个这样的资本主义国家，它能够像苏联一样帮助阿拉伯国家争取独立！恩纳法说，我预祝苏联人民在完成七年计划中获得成功，我相信你们一定成功。
    恩纳法的讲话受到代表们的热烈欢迎。
