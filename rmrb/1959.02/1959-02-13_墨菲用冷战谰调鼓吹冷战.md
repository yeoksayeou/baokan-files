Xinhua News Agency, New York, 12th dispatch: U.S. Deputy Undersecretary of State Murphy delivered a speech at the Worcester Economic Club in Massachusetts on the 10th, reiterating the "Cold War" policy of U.S. foreign policy.

    When talking about the West Berlin issue, Murphy stated that the United States will do its best to keep West Berlin as an outpost for the "Cold War" and for sabotage and conspiracy activities against socialist countries. In his speech, he slandered the Soviet Union for using the West Berlin issue to "intensify the Cold War," saying that if Western countries withdrew from Berlin, it would "undoubtedly complicate matters severely." He clamored that the United States should "maintain a firm position" on this issue. Murphy's remarks clearly show that the phrase "intensifying the Cold War" by using the Berlin issue is applicable to the United States itself.

    Under pressure from domestic and international public opinion, Murphy, while emphasizing this "Cold War" policy of the United States, had to express that the United States is willing to "seek all opportunities to seek meaningful negotiations on the Berlin issue." He also admitted that there are "differences of opinion" between the United States and its allies on this issue.

    In the opening part of his speech, Murphy talked about the overall world situation, saying that there are currently some issues that make the United States "uneasy." From Murphy's remarks, it can be seen that these issues are the strong economic development of socialist countries such as the Soviet Union and China and the upsurge of the world national independence movement. He admitted that socialist countries such as the Soviet Union and China have "good prospects for great industrial and economic development," and the United States is "living in a highly competitive era" and is "constantly under the pressure of a hostile social system." However, he attempted to comfort himself, insisting that "it seems" the United States has "the same good prospects for great development" as socialist countries, and the comparison of the strength of the two forces "will not have a major change for a while."

    Murphy admitted that the "peaceful coexistence" foreign policy pursued by socialist countries has had a profound impact in vast areas of the world and has "affected" the United States' policies of aggression and expansion "in some important regions" of the world. He said that the "situation regarding the relationship between the free world and the Sino-Soviet bloc" "overshadows the entire foreign policy of the United States." Murphy admitted that the United States has a weakness, which is that the American people are unwilling to sacrifice their lives for the war adventures of the American rulers. He said, "Perhaps a weakness in the struggle" of the United States' "position is that the people of the free world are unwilling to engage in" and "be drawn into such a struggle." Therefore, Murphy tried his best to issue malicious and distorted slanders against the peaceful coexistence policy of socialist countries, attempting to deceive the people of the "free world" to support the "Cold War" policy of the United States. Murphy also attempted to sow discord between socialist countries and nationally independent countries. He even wanted to portray the notorious colonialism as a friend of nationally independent countries, saying that Western countries "reserved" the "freedom" to choose "aid" for nationally independent countries, while socialist countries were to "deprive" them of this freedom. Murphy even more shamelessly attempted to deceive himself, insisting that the various enslaving conditions attached to U.S. foreign "aid," and the use of "aid" as a means to carry out economic aggression and achieve political goals, were the United States "rapidly and compassionately meeting the economic and financial needs of Asian countries in development."

    Although Murphy admitted that "the rise of the people of Asia and Africa to strive for independence and devote themselves to economic and social progress is the most important thing in the mid-twentieth century." "The rise of nationalism and the awakening of people of all countries is particularly evident on the African continent." However, in his speech, he futilely covered up for colonialist countries, while worrying that colonial people would use force to oppose the rule of imperialism. He stated that the United States should try to obstruct the resistance struggle of colonial people, saying that one of the purposes of U.S. policy is to make the national independence movement "develop along peaceful paths and prevent the occurrence of explosive situations that could involve everyone," and "a major problem" in Africa is to "adjust" rather than change "the relationship between dependent countries and European ruling countries," and the United States maintains so-called "friendly contact" with the national independence movement in this spirit. Murphy's remarks fully exposed the true face of the United States as the most ferocious colonialist.

    In his speech, Murphy also daydreamed, trying to sow discord between the friendly and intimate brotherly relationship between China and the Soviet Union. However, he had to admit that his attempt was futile. China and the Soviet Union continue to strengthen cooperation in political, economic and military fields, so that any such illusions of imperialist elements will eventually burst like soap bubbles.

    Murphy finally asked his audience not to believe in "dark prophecies" but to muster "confidence." However, he had to admit that "now is not the time for (the United States) to be complacent."

### 墨菲用冷战谰调鼓吹冷战

    墨菲用冷战谰调鼓吹冷战
    污蔑社会主义国家的和平共处政策
    毫不讳言要阻挠殖民地人民的斗争
    新华社12日讯　纽约消息：美国副国务卿帮办墨菲10日在马萨诸塞州武斯特经济俱乐部发表一篇演说，重申美国外交政策的“冷战”方针。
    墨菲在谈到西柏林问题时表示，美国要竭力保持西柏林继续作为一个“冷战”和对社会主义国家进行破坏和阴谋活动的前哨。他在演说里污蔑苏联利用西柏林问题“加剧冷战”，说什么如果西方国家撤离柏林，就“会毫无疑问地使事情严重复杂化起来”。他扬言美国在这个问题上要“保持坚定的立场”。墨菲这段话清楚表明，利用柏林问题“加剧冷战”的话，正适用于美国自己。
    迫于国内外舆论的压力，墨菲在强调美国这一“冷战”方针的同时，又不得不表示美国愿意“寻求一切机会来谋求就柏林问题进行有意义的谈判”。他并且承认，美国同它的盟国之间在这个问题上“意见是有分歧的”。
    墨菲在演说的开头部分谈到了总的世界形势，他说，目前有些使美国“感到不安”的问题。从墨菲的谈话可以看出，这些问题就是苏联和中国等社会主义国家经济的强大发展和世界民族独立运动的高涨。他承认，苏联和中国等社会主义国家有着“工业和经济大大发展的美好前景”，美国“生活在一个竞争性很强的时代”，“经常处于一个敌对的社会制度的压力之下”。但是，他又妄图自我安慰，硬说“看来”美国有同社会主义国家“一样大大发展的美好前景”，两种力量地位的对比“一时不会有重大的改变”。
    墨菲承认，社会主义国家所执行的“和平共处”外交政策在世界广大地区产生了深刻的影响，在世界“某些重要地区影响了”美国的侵略和扩张政策。他说，关于“自由世界和中苏集团之间的关系的情况”，“笼罩着美国整个的外交政策”。墨菲承认美国有个弱点，那就是美国人民不愿为美国统治者的战争冒险去卖命。他说，“或许在斗争中”美国的“地位的一个弱点就是自由世界的人民不愿意从事”和“被卷入这样一场斗争”。于是墨菲就竭力对社会主义国家的和平共处的政策发出恶意和歪曲的污蔑，企图骗使“自由世界”的人民来支持美国的“冷战”政策。墨菲还力图挑拨社会主义国家和民族独立国家的关系。他竟然想把臭名万代的殖民主义说成是民族独立国家的朋友，说什么西方国家为民族独立国家“保留了”选择“援助”的“自由”，而社会主义国家则是要“剥夺”它们的这种自由。墨菲还更加无耻地企图掩耳盗铃，硬把美国在对外“援助”中所附带的种种奴役性条件，和以“援助”作为执行经济侵略和达到政治目的的手段，说成是美国“迅速而同情地满足亚洲国家在发展方面的经济和财政需要。”
    墨菲虽然承认，“亚非人民起来争取独立，致力于经济和社会的进步，是二十世纪中叶最重要的事情。”“民族主义的高涨和各国人民的觉醒在非洲大陆特别明显”。但是，他在演说中却徒劳地为殖民主义国家打掩护，同时耽心殖民地人民用武力来反对帝国主义的统治。他表示美国要设法阻挠殖民地人民的反抗斗争，他说，美国政策的目的之一是使民族独立运动“按照和平途径发展下去和防止发生可能把所有的人都卷进去的爆炸局势”，在非洲的“一个主要问题”是“调整”而不是改变“附属国和欧洲统治国之间的关系”，美国就是本着这种精神同民族独立运动保持着所谓“友好的接触”。墨菲这段话充分暴露了美国这个最凶恶的殖民主义者的真面目。
    墨菲在演说中还白昼作梦，力图挑拨中国同苏联之间友好无间的兄弟关系。但是，他不得不承认他的这种企图是徒劳的，中国和苏联继续在政治、经济和军事方面加强合作，使得帝国主义分子的任何这种幻想最后将像肥皂泡一样破灭。
    墨菲最后要他的听众不要相信“阴暗的预言”而要鼓起“信心”。但是，他不得不承认“目前不是（美国）沾沾自喜的时候”。
