Repairing the Roof in a Snowy Night

The wind and snow had battered the whole day, and the temporary thatched huts built by the migrant workers in Xiaoxian County, Anhui Province, had holes blown open by the wind and snow. Li Yongqi, a Communist Party member, was as anxious as if he were being fried in oil. He thought: This is a major issue concerning the health of the migrant workers, and a solution must be found. But it was already late, and there was no time to build new shelters. What to do? After considering it, he unhesitatingly braved the wind and snow and went from the construction site to the village. He borrowed a house in the village, but the roof also leaked a bit. So he took several migrant workers to a brother company to borrow rice straw, climbed onto the roof, and patched up the holes one by one.

Outside the house, the wind and snow continued to rage. The migrant workers happily gathered together, looking at Comrade Li Yongqi, emitting bursts of kind and hearty laughter. People were genuinely grateful to this Communist Party member who cared about everyone's lives.

    风雪夜里补屋顶
    大风大雪吹打了一天，安徽萧县城民工们搭的临时草屋被风雪打得开了洞。共产党员李永启心里急得如油煎，他想：这是关系到民工身体健康的大问题，一定要想办法解决。但是这时天色已晚，重新盖个住处来不及了。怎办呢？他考虑了一下，就毫不犹豫地冒着风雪从工地到村子里去了。他在村子里借到了房子，不过屋顶也有点漏风，于是他又带着几个民工到兄弟连借来了稻草，爬上屋顶把漏洞一一补好。
    房子外面的风雪，仍然吹打不停。民工们高高兴兴地围在一起，望着李永启同志，发出阵阵亲切爽朗的笑声，人们都从心眼里感激这位关心大家生活的共产党员。
