    The great leap forward in socialist construction and the great victory of the socialist revolution in pastoral areas in 1958, the vigorous development of the people's commune movement, the implementation of a whole set of construction policies of walking on two legs, the great liberation of people's mental outlook, and the unprecedented upsurge of mass enthusiasm and creativity have all provided extremely favorable conditions for realizing new and greater leaps forward in the future. Therefore, it is entirely possible to complete and overfulfill the targets of the 1959 plan for developing the national economy formulated by this provincial party committee meeting. However, some people, in recognizing the possibility of reality, often only emphasize the objective and neglect the role of subjective initiative; they only see unfavorable conditions and fail to see or even obliterate more favorable conditions; they only see things and not people. Therefore, their understanding cannot comprehensively and truthfully reflect the original appearance of objective reality. Right-leaning conservative thinking must be constantly overcome, and superstitions cannot be completely broken all at once. Therefore, in order to make ideological understanding conform to objective reality as much as possible and correctly grasp objective laws, we must constantly be vigilant and overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, and we must constantly promote a revolutionary style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act.
    The reason why we must continue to overcome right-leaning conservatism is precisely to encourage people to muster even greater revolutionary drive. The practice of the Great Leap Forward tells us: When people break superstitions and remove all kinds of shackles in the ideological field that do not conform to objective truth, they can fully exert the subjective initiative of pursuing truth and daring to practice, and they can create unprecedented miracles.
    The reason why our revolution and construction undertakings have been able to achieve great leaps forward again and again is precisely because they correctly reflect the development of objective reality, conform to the demands and will of the broad masses of people. Practice has proven that in places where great leaps forward are achieved with the strides of giants, one of their common laws is that they can correctly or relatively correctly understand reality, and resolutely and fully apply the working method of the mass line, respect the practice of the masses, and respect the revolutionary nature and creativity of the masses. Arranging one's actions according to this principle not only victoriously realizes the goal of the leap forward, but also draws strength and wisdom from the masses. Therefore, their revolutionary optimism can be forever vigorous, both full of drive and pragmatic. It must be affirmed that the vast majority of cadres have done this, otherwise we would not have been able to achieve the great victory of 1958. It is also precisely because of the practice of the vast number of cadres and the masses working together and the close combination of leaders and the masses that the party's working methods of the mass line have been greatly enriched. However, also because the revolutionary situation has developed very rapidly, people's understanding has not been able to completely reflect objective reality in time, and therefore there are still some shortcomings in the implementation of the mass line. In order to realize a greater leap forward in 1959, all work and all departments should strive to improve the level of leading mass movements. This is the most effective measure for implementing the socialist construction line and a whole set of construction policies of walking on two legs, and it is also a good way to continue to overcome right-leaning conservatism.

    保守思想要经常克服
    1958年社会主义建设的大跃进和牧业区社会主义革命的大胜利，人民公社化运动的蓬勃发展，用两条腿走路的一整套建设方针的贯彻，人们精神面貌的大大解放，群众积极性和创造性的空前高涨，都为实现今后新的更大的跃进，提供了十分有利的条件。因此，完成和超额完成省委这次会议所制订的1959年发展国民经济的计划的指标，是完全可能的。然而，有些人却在认识现实的可能性问题上，往往只强调客观，忽视主观能动性的作用；只看不利条件，看不到或者抹煞更有利的条件；只见物，不见人。因此，他们的认识就不可能全面地如实地反映客观实际的本来面目。右倾保守思想是要经常克服的，迷信也不是一下子都能破完的。所以，要使思想认识尽可能地符合客观实际，正确地掌握客观规律，就要经常地警惕和克服右倾保守思想，就要不断地发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的革命风格。
    我们所以要继续克服右倾保守，正是为了要人们鼓足更大的革命干劲。大跃进的实践告诉我们：当人们破除了迷信，在思想领域中解除了不符合客观真理的种种束缚之后，就能充分地发挥追求真理、勇于实践的主观能动作用，就能创造出破天荒的奇迹。
    我们的革命和建设事业之所以能够一再大跃进，正因为它正确反映了客观现实的发展情况，符合广大人民群众的要求和意志，实践证明，凡是以巨人的步伐大跃进的地方，他们的共同规律之一，就是因为能够正确地或比较正确地认识现实，坚决地充分地运用了群众路线的工作方法，尊重群众的实践，尊重群众的革命性和创造性。按照这个原则安排自己的行动，不仅胜利地实现了跃进的目的，而且从群众中吸取了力量和智慧。因而他们的革命的乐观主义精神就能永远的旺盛下去，既干劲冲天，又实事求是。必须肯定，绝大多数干部是这样做了的，不然我们就不可能取得1958年的大胜利。也正由于广大干部和群众在一起、领导和群众密切结合的实践，才大大丰富了党的群众路线的工作方法。但是，也由于革命形势发展十分迅速，人的认识一时还来不及完备的反映客观实际，因而在执行群众路线上，还存在一些不够的地方。为了实现1959年更大的跃进，一切工作，一切部门都应该努力提高领导群众运动的水平，这是贯彻执行社会主义建设路线和用两条腿走路的一整套建设方针的最有效的措施，也是继续克服右倾保守的良方。
