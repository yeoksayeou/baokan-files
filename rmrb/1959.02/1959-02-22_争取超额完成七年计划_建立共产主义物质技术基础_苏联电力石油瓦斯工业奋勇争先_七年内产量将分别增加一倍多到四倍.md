Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 21st: Our correspondent reports: The Soviet Seven-Year Plan, approved by the recently concluded 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, marks the decisive stage in the Soviet Union's comprehensive national electrification. Key figures from the Seven-Year Plan and materials published in Soviet newspapers indicate that by 1965, the Soviet Union's per capita electricity production will increase from an average of 1,028 kilowatt-hours in 1957 to approximately 2,300 kilowatt-hours, exceeding the current per capita electricity production levels of countries such as Britain, France, and West Germany. At that time, electricity consumption in Soviet industry will increase by 1.2 times compared to the present, and the electricity available to each industrial worker will almost double, bringing industrial power supply close to current US levels. Agricultural electricity consumption will increase approximately threefold. All collective farms will have basically completed electrification by the end of the Seven-Year Plan, and state farms and machinery repair stations will complete electrification even earlier (currently, only 92%-93% of farms in the US are electrified). The level of railway electrification will greatly exceed that of the United States, with the length of electrified railway lines more than doubling to nearly 30,000 kilometers. Electricity will be used more widely in daily life for residents.

In order to establish the material and technical foundation of communism and complete national electrification, the scale of increase in Soviet electricity production and power station construction in the next seven years will be unprecedentedly large. The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that by 1965, the Soviet Union's electricity production will reach 500 billion to 520 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of more than double. Given the already high level of electricity production, such a growth rate is very rapid. As we know, during the period 1952-1958, the total electricity production in the Soviet Union increased by approximately 130 billion kilowatt-hours, an average annual increase of approximately 19 billion kilowatt-hours. In the next seven years, the absolute increase in total electricity production will reach 270 billion to 290 billion kilowatt-hours, with an average annual increase of 38.5 billion to 41.5 billion kilowatt-hours, more than double the growth of the past seven years.

In terms of power station construction, the total generating capacity of power stations to be completed and put into production in the Soviet Union in the next seven years will reach 58 million to 60 million kilowatts, more than doubling the current total generating capacity of power stations nationwide. This means that the total generating capacity of power stations to be completed and put into production in the Soviet Union in the next seven years will exceed the sum of the generating capacity of all power stations completed and put into production in the Soviet Union over the past forty-one years, and will be approximately 80% more than the increase in generating capacity in the past seven years. If the Soviet Union increased its generating capacity by 5 million to 6 million kilowatts annually in the past two years, then the average annual increase in new generating capacity in the next seven years will reach 8 million to 9 million kilowatts.

Currently, thermal power plants produce 81% of the Soviet Union's electricity. In order to gain time in the peaceful economic competition with the United States, the Seven-Year Plan stipulates that even more attention should be paid to prioritizing the construction of thermal power plants, which require less investment and have shorter construction periods. During this period, 118 new thermal power plants will be built and 130 power plants will be expanded; the increased generating capacity of thermal power plants nationwide will account for approximately four-fifths of the total increase in generating capacity in the Soviet Union during the seven-year period. Compared to the past seven years, the increase in the generating capacity of thermal power plants in the next seven years will be more than double.

During the Seven-Year Plan, the scale of hydropower station construction in the Soviet Union, although smaller than that of thermal power plants, will still exceed that of the past. The generating capacity of new hydropower stations to be completed and put into production in the next seven years will increase from 7.4 million kilowatts in the past seven years to over 10 million kilowatts.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 20th: Our correspondent reports: The Soviet Union will develop its fuel industry at a rapid pace during the Seven-Year Plan, with priority given to the development of the oil and gas industries. According to the plan, in the next seven years, the absolute annual increase in Soviet oil production will exceed the absolute increase in the forty-one years since the founding of the Soviet Union; the absolute increase in gas production will be more than three times greater than the absolute increase in the thirty years since 1928.

The Soviet fuel industry has always developed very rapidly. People still remember that before the October Revolution, Russia's fuel industry was very backward. In 1917, Russia only produced 31.4 million tons of coal and 8.8 million tons of oil, while the gas industry was entirely developed after the October Revolution. However, by the end of 1958, the Soviet Union's coal production had reached 496 million tons, exceeding that of the United States and ranking first in the world; annual oil production had reached 113 million tons, nearly thirteen times the production in 1917; and gas production had reached 29.8 billion cubic meters, 1,753 times the annual production in 1913.

In the three years since the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet fuel industry has moved forward at a very rapid pace. During the three years, coal production increased by 105 million tons, while oil and gas production increased by 60% and twofold respectively. If the average annual increase in coal production was 26 million tons from 1951 to 1955, then the average annual increase in the last three years has been 35 million tons. Oil production increased by an average of 6.6 million tons annually during the Fifth Five-Year Plan, while in the last three years it has increased by an average of 14 million tons annually. In 1957, the total oil production of all capitalist countries increased by only 29 million tons, while the United States increased by only 300,000 tons. In 1958, oil extraction in the United States decreased by 7.5% due to the impact of the economic crisis.

During the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will develop its oil and gas industries on a large scale. During the seven years, oil and gas production will increase by more than double to fourfold respectively. The average annual absolute increase during the Seven-Year Plan alone is equivalent to more than twice the total annual production in 1917; the average annual absolute increase in gas production is equivalent to fifty-six times the production in 1928.

In the next seven years, the scale of gas extraction will be even larger than that of oil. More than 160 gas storage areas have now been discovered throughout the Soviet Union. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the Uzbek Republic alone will extract 18.3 billion cubic meters of gas, while in 1958 this republic only produced 172.2 million cubic meters of gas. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the thermal energy generated by the natural gas extracted throughout the Soviet Union will be approximately equal to the total thermal energy generated by the coal produced in the Soviet Union's several important coal regions—Donbas, Pechora, and Moscow—in early 1958.

As a result of developing the oil and gas industries at an unprecedented speed, by 1965, the structure of the entire fuel industry in the Soviet Union will undergo fundamental changes. The proportion of oil and gas in the total production of the fuel industry will increase from the current 31% to 51%, while the proportion of coal will decrease from the current 60% to 43%.

    争取超额完成七年计划　建立共产主义物质技术基础
    苏联电力石油瓦斯工业奋勇争先
    七年内产量将分别增加一倍多到四倍
    新华社莫斯科21日电　本社记者报道：最近闭幕的苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会通过的苏联七年计划，开始了苏联完成国家全盘电气化的决定性阶段。七年计划的控制数字和苏联报纸发表的材料表明，到1965年，苏联按人口平均计算的电力产量将由1957年的平均每人一千零二十八度增加到大约二千三百度，超过英、法、西德等国目前按人口计算的电力生产水平。那时候，苏联工业的用电量将比现在增加一点二倍，工业工人所摊的用电量将几乎提高一倍，对工业的电力供应将接近目前美国的水平。农业用电量将增加三倍左右，所有集体农庄在七年计划结束时将基本上完成电气化，而国营农场和机械修配站电气化的完成还要早得多（目前美国只有92％—93％的农场实行了电气化）。铁路电气化程度将大大超过美国，电气化铁路线长度将增加为现在的两倍以上，达到将近三万公里。在居民日常生活中，电力将得到更广泛的应用。
    为了建立共产主义物质技术基础和完成全国电气化，今后七年苏联电力生产增加的规模和发电站建设的规模将空前地巨大。七年计划规定，到1965年苏联的电力产量将达到五千亿到五千二百亿度，即增加一倍以上。在电力生产水平已经很高的基础上，这样的增长速度是非常快的。大家知道，在1952—1958年期间，苏联电力总产量增加了约一千三百亿度，每年平均增加约一百九十亿度，而在今后七年中，电力总产量的绝对增长额将达二千七百亿到二千九百亿度，年平均增长额为三百八十五亿至四百一十五亿度，即比过去七年的增长额多一倍以上。
    在发电站建设方面，今后七年苏联建成和投入生产的发电站的总发电能力将达五千八百万到六千万瓩，把目前全国发电站的总发电能力翻一番以上。这就是说，在今后七年内苏联要建成和投入生产的发电站总发电能力，还超过过去四十一年苏联建成和投入生产的全部发电站的发电能力的总和，比过去七年增加的发电能力则多80％左右。如果过去两年苏联每年增加五百万至六百万瓩发电能力，那么今后七年平均每年增加的新发电能力则达八百万至九百万瓩。
    目前，火力发电站生产着苏联81％的电力。为了争取在同美国进行的和平经济竞赛中赢得时间，七年计划规定要比过去更加注意优先开展投资少、建筑期限短的火力发电站的建设。在这期间，要建成一百一十八个新的火力发电站并扩建一百三十个发电站；全国火力发电站增加的发电能力，将占七年期间苏联增加的总发电能力的五分之四左右。和过去七年比较，今后七年火力发电站发电能力的增加额将多一倍以上。
    在七年计划期间，苏联水电站建设的规模虽然比火力发电站小，但是仍超过过去。今后七年建成和投入生产的新水电站的发电能力将从过去七年的七百四十万瓩增加到一千万瓩以上。
    新华社莫斯科20日电　本社记者报道：苏联在七年计划期间将以飞快的速度发展燃料工业，并且要优先发展石油工业和瓦斯工业。根据计划，在未来七年中，苏联石油年产量的绝对增长量将超过苏联建国后四十一年的绝对增长量；瓦斯的绝对增长量将比1928年以来三十年的绝对增长量多三倍多。
    苏联的燃料工业过去一直是发展得十分迅速的。人们还记得，十月革命以前，俄国的燃料工业很落后。1917年，俄国只生产了三千一百四十万吨煤、八百八十万吨石油，而瓦斯工业则完全是十月革命以后才发展起来的。可是到1958年底，苏联的煤产量已达四亿九千六百万吨，超过了美国而跃居世界第一位；石油的年产量已达一亿一千三百万吨，为1917年产量的将近十三倍；而瓦斯产量则达二百九十八亿立方公尺，为1913年年产量的一千七百五十三倍。
    在苏共第二十次代表大会以来的三年中，苏联的燃料工业以很快的速度向前发展。在三年期间，采煤量增加了一亿零五百万吨，而石油和瓦斯产量则分别增加了60％和两倍。如果说，1951到1955年每年平均增加了二千六百万吨煤，那么，最近三年来每年则平均增加了三千五百万吨。石油在第五个五年计划期间平均每年增加了六百六十万吨，而近三年来则平均每年增加了一千四百万吨。1957年，所有资本主义国家的石油产量总共才增加了二千九百万吨，而美国仅仅增加了三十万吨。1958年，美国的石油开采量因受经济危机的冲击还减少了7.5％。
    在七年计划期间，苏联将大规模地发展石油工业和瓦斯工业。七年期间，石油和瓦斯生产将分别增加一倍多到四倍。仅七年计划期间的每年平均绝对增长量就相当于1917年的全年产量的两倍还多；瓦斯每年平均绝对增长量则相当于1928年产量的五十六倍。
    在未来七年中，瓦斯开采规模比石油还要庞大。现在苏联全国已经发现有一百六十多个瓦斯储藏区。单是乌兹别克共和国到七年计划结束时就将开采一百八十三亿立方公尺的瓦斯，而1958年这个共和国只生产了一亿七千二百万立方公尺瓦斯。到七年计划结束的时候，全苏联开采的天然瓦斯所能产生的热能将大约等于苏联几个重要煤区——顿巴斯、彼乔拉和莫斯科等煤区1958年初出产的煤所产生的全部热能。
    由于以空前的速度发展石油工业和瓦斯工业的结果，到1965年的时候，苏联整个燃料工业的结构将发生根本变化。石油和瓦斯在燃料工业的生产总量中所占的比重将从目前的31％增加到51％，而煤所占的比重将由现在的60％降低到43％。
