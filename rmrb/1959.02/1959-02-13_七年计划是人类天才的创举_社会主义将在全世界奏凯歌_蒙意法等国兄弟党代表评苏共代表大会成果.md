Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Representatives of fraternal parties from various countries who were invited to attend the 21st Congress of the CPSU continued to publish articles and give talks, commenting on the great achievements and significance of the congress.

    First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, spoke at a mass rally in Ulaanbaatar on the 12th after returning home from attending the CPSU Congress, saying that the delegation of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party was warmly received by the Soviet people during its stay in the Soviet Union, and that the delegation had expressed its heartfelt congratulations to the Soviet people and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He said that the seven-year construction plan discussed and adopted by the 21st Congress of the CPSU is a great program for building communism and a program for socialism to surpass capitalism in peaceful competition. This congress marked a new period for the Soviet Union to enter into the comprehensive development of communist society. The congress dealt a heavy blow to modern revisionists.
    When the General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Palmiro Togliatti, returned to Rome from Moscow on the evening of the 10th, he answered reporters' questions, saying: "The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is an event of great political significance for the Soviet Union and the international workers' movement, and I think it is also the case for the whole world." Togliatti believes that the resolutions of this congress trace back to the resolutions of the 20th Congress in various aspects of economic and political life and have been developed, which is of particularly great significance.
    Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, Jacques Duclos, wrote in the Soviet "Pravda" on the 11th that the communist parties of capitalist countries attending the 21st Congress of the CPSU could not fail to see that the daily life they often saw in their own countries was in stark contrast to the great victories achieved by the builders of communism. Duclos emphasized that the Soviet Union's peaceful challenge to capitalist countries proves the confidence of the countries that are building communism in the superiority of its production system. The completion of the Seven-Year Plan will soon make it possible to fulfill the task of the Soviet Union surpassing advanced capitalist countries in terms of per capita production.
    General Secretary of the Finnish Communist Party, Ville Pessi, delivered a speech at a rally held in Helsinki after returning home from attending the 21st Congress of the CPSU. He said that the CPSU congresses have always aroused great interest throughout the world. The recently concluded congress has attracted particular attention because the congress discussed the Soviet Union's magnificent plan for developing the national economy in the next seven years.
    Pessi said that the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan makes people believe that socialism and communism will surely triumph throughout the world.
    Secretary of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party, Henri Blum, published an article in the "Red Flag Weekly" after returning home from attending the 21st Congress of the CPSU, evaluating the achievements of the 21st Congress of the CPSU. Blum wrote that the Seven-Year Plan adopted by this congress is a great creation, a rare initiative of creative labor that human genius has ever aspired to.

　　社会主义将在全世界奏凯歌
　　蒙意法等国兄弟党代表评苏共代表大会成果
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：应邀参加苏共二十一次代表大会的各国兄弟党代表继续发表文章和谈话，评论这次代表大会的伟大成就和意义。
    蒙古人民革命党中央委员会第一书记泽登巴尔在参加苏共代表大会回国后，12日在乌兰巴托的群众大会上讲话说，蒙古人民革命党代表团在苏联逗留期间，受到苏联人民的热情接待，代表团曾向苏联人民和苏联共产党表示衷心的祝贺。他说，苏共第二十一次代表大会讨论通过的七年建设计划是建设共产主义的伟大纲领，是在和平竞赛中社会主义胜过资本主义的纲领。这次大会标志着苏联进入全面展开共产主义社会建设的新时期。大会对现代修正主义者给予沉重的打击。
    意大利共产党总书记帕尔米罗·陶里亚蒂，10日傍晚从莫斯科回到罗马时，回答记者的问题说：“苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会对苏联和国际工人运动是一个有极大政治意义的事件，我想，对整个世界来说，也是如此。”陶里亚蒂认为，这次代表大会的决议溯源于第二十次代表大会在经济和政治生活各方面的决议，并且有所发展，这是意义特别重大的。
    法国共产党中央委员会书记杜克洛11日在苏联“真理报”上写道，参加苏共第二十一次代表大会的资本主义国家的共产党人都不能不看到，他们在自己国家所经常看到的日常生活同共产主义建设者所取得的伟大胜利成了鲜明的对照。杜克洛强调说，苏联对资本主义国家发出的和平挑战证明了正在建设共产主义的国家对于它的生产制度优越性的信心。完成七年计划将使苏联在按人口平均计算的生产量方面超过先进资本主义国家的任务很快就可以实现。
    芬兰共产党总书记维勒·培西在参加苏共二十一次代表大会回国后在赫尔辛基举行的集会上发表演说。他说，苏共历次代表大会总是引起全世界的巨大兴趣。最近闭幕的代表大会特别引起了人们的注意，这是因为在代表大会上讨论了苏联在最近七年发展国民经济的宏伟计划。
    培西说，苏联的七年计划使人们相信，社会主义和共产主义必定将在全世界取得胜利。
    比利时共产党中央委员会书记布吕姆在参加苏共二十一次代表大会回国后在“红旗报周刊”上发表文章，评价苏共第二十一次代表大会的成果。布吕姆写道，这次代表大会通过的七年计划是一个巨大的创造，是人类天才所曾经响往的创造性劳动的罕有的创举。
