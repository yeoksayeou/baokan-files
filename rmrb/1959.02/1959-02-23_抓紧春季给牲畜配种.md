Heilongjiang Strives for Large-Scale Livestock Production
    (Our newspaper, Harbin, 22nd) Heilongjiang Province will launch a "Double Full" (large livestock fully pregnant, full condition), "One Without" (without livestock epidemics), "Five All" (livestock all bred, all accurate, all born, all alive, all strong), "Ten Rearing" (large rearing of horses, donkeys, mules, cattle, dairy cows, pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, rabbits) large-scale livestock production movement this year to develop animal husbandry production. This was proposed at the Provincial Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Work Conference currently being jointly held by the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee. This year, the province's horses will increase by 18% compared to last year, cattle will increase by 22.4% compared to last year, dairy cows will increase by 75.9% compared to last year, sheep will increase by 89.1%, pigs will increase by 143.8%, and poultry (including chickens and ducks) will increase by 566%. The number of pigs and poultry developed this year alone is equivalent to each rural resident in the province raising one pig and ten chickens (ducks) on average.
    Currently, animal husbandry departments in various regions are vigorously grasping livestock breeding work. Last winter, provincial departments trained 1,500 artificial insemination instructors for livestock for various counties. In January of this year, these people trained a large number of artificial insemination technicians for various people's communes. These farmer-breeders are concentrating mares, some preparing for breeding, and some have already begun breeding. In order to ensure the realization of this year's Great Leap Forward plan, comprehensive breeding stations have been universally established in various communes, forming a breeding network, and adopting low-temperature preservation of semen, promoting centralized breeding of female animals, in order to achieve timely breeding, year-round breeding, multiple breeding, and repeated breeding, ensuring full breeding of female animals, and accurate full breeding. All the small female pigs born this year with good physical condition will be retained as breeding sows this year; half of the eggs produced in the first half of this year will be used to hatch chicks, adopting the method of "eat less first, then eat more."
    To ensure the great development of livestock this year, the prevention and control of livestock diseases will also be strengthened. Local animal husbandry departments will continue to vigorously carry out mass epidemic prevention movements, establish epidemic prevention and hygiene systems, and implement epidemic prevention measures such as blockade, isolation, disinfection, and corpse disposal, especially carrying out regular comprehensive epidemic prevention injections and quarantine to ensure the realization of a disease-free province this year. Strengthen feed and feeding management. Store all available agricultural and sideline products as livestock feed, vigorously engage in silage feed, protect and improve grasslands, increase grass production, store a large amount of wild grass and vegetables, plant high-yield feed crops, and provide livestock with nutritious green feed all year round. Livestock feeding management will continue to promote the responsibility system and implement technological innovation, and universally promote the method of separate small trough feeding for old, weak, and pregnant animals to protect livestock.

Liaoning Emphasizes Both Livestock Breeding and Improvement
Yunnan Universally Launches the Four All Movement
    (Our newspaper, Shenyang, 22nd) Liaoning plans to greatly increase large livestock, pigs, and sheep this year compared to last year, and strive for full improvement of horses, cattle, and sheep.
    In order to achieve the leap forward targets for various livestock, the work of selecting breeds and establishing stations this year started more than a month earlier than last year. Currently, according to statistics from twenty-five counties and cities, 363 comprehensive and single-purpose artificial insemination stations for livestock have been established, 1,297 inseminators have been trained, and more than 1,100 breeding sires have been selected.
    In order to achieve a greater harvest in animal husbandry this year, many regions have summarized and promoted last year's leap forward experience. For example, according to last year's experience, Changtu County will achieve "Six All," "Four Without," and "Ten Satisfaction" this year. "Six All" are: all bred, all accurate, all born, all alive, all strong, all large. "Four Without" are: without thinness, without disease, without epidemics, without death. "Ten Satisfaction" are: high-speed development satisfies the state; thriving livestock and poultry satisfy the commune; increased income satisfies the commune members; increased manure satisfies agriculture; increased products satisfy industry; increased commodities satisfy supply and marketing; increased animal power satisfies transportation; no disease and no epidemics satisfy the breeders; increased fresh milk satisfies the old and young; more meat, milk, and eggs satisfy everyone. In addition, it is also necessary to achieve specialization of commune-run pastures, year-round livestock and poultry breeding, popularization of artificial insemination, improved breeds of livestock and poultry breeding, directional breeding of young livestock, dual-purpose yellow cattle for milk and draft, self-sufficiency in feed production, year-round green feed, grassland water conservancy, rational management systems, comprehensive prevention and control work, veterinary care for the livestock team, and all-round skills for livestock personnel.

    (Our newspaper, Kunming, 22nd) In order to achieve this year's greater leap forward targets for animal husbandry, a mass movement striving for "full pregnancy of female animals, full production of pregnant animals, full survival of young animals, and full strength of large animals" has been universally launched throughout Yunnan Province.
    Most areas of the province have established livestock breeding stations and artificial insemination stations, and introduced and retained a large number of excellent breeding sires. Up to now, Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, Qujing Prefecture, and seventeen counties including Songming have basically achieved full pregnancy of female animals. The livestock breeding movement of "all bred, all pregnant, all born, all alive" is continuing to develop. The action slogan of Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture is: make full preparations, select good breeds, equip the instruments, work hard in the spring, and ensure that 100% of the eligible female animals in the prefecture are bred and pregnant.

Inner Mongolia to Increase Livestock by Nine Million Head
    (Our newspaper, Hohhot, 22nd) Currently, a high tide of large-scale livestock production has been set off in the vast pastoral areas and rural areas of Inner Mongolia. Herdsmen and farmers of all ethnic groups are determined to increase livestock by more than nine million head this year.
    Since last winter, the region has safely overwintered more than 20 million head of livestock, and at the same time, has delivered more than 1.12 million young animals, with a survival rate of over 95%, which is more than the same period last year, and launched the first shot for this year's animal husbandry. Now, people of all ethnic groups in the region are working hard to launch the second shot around the Qingming Festival. Strive to reach a total of 28.14 million head of livestock in the region this year.

Henan Vigorously Engages in Artificial Insemination of Livestock
Gansu Animal Husbandry Front Plants Red Flags
    (Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, 22nd) Currently, about 60% of the eligible female animals in Henan Province are pregnant. The province is continuing to vigorously engage in livestock breeding work, striving to achieve full pregnancy of female animals before the "May Day" holiday.
    In order to seize the spring breeding and strive to achieve a greater leap forward in livestock breeding this year, Henan Province has convened livestock breeding meetings from the province to the county recently, inspiring people to strive for a greater leap forward in animal husbandry.
    Achieving artificial insemination is an important measure taken by Henan Province this year to do a good job in livestock breeding. At present, the number of artificial insemination stations in the province has increased from 550 in December last year to 940. From January to now, more than 3,900 technicians are being trained and have been trained in various places.
    In order to promote early estrus in livestock, many places inject pregnant women's urine, pregnant mare serum, etc. to induce estrus in female animals. While grasping the spring breeding of draft animals, various places have universally strengthened the work of loving and protecting livestock. More than 20 counties including Deng County and Shenqiu have established a livestock file system to strengthen feeding management according to the specific situation of each animal.

    (Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 22nd) Gansu Province vigorously plants red flags on the animal husbandry front, promoting a mass movement for a comprehensive harvest in animal husbandry this year.
    In recent months, party committees at all levels in various parts of the province have held more than 1,000 on-site meetings on animal husbandry production, state-owned ranch production, etc., and planted more than 20 red flags for high-yielding livestock, breeding improvement, technological innovation, feeding management, epidemic prevention and hygiene, and taming wild animals throughout the province. Under the driving force of these advanced red flags, the animal husbandry front in the province has presented a new and vigorous situation. People's communes in various places have established more than 80,000 pastures, and many new artificial insemination stations have also been established. Under the slogan of "all bred, all accurate, all born, all alive, all strong," livestock breeding is continuing vigorously.

Shandong Selects Strong Livestock for Breeding
Fujian Vigorously Grasps Feeding and Breeding
    (Our newspaper, Jinan, 22nd) People's communes in various parts of Shandong vigorously carry out livestock selection and breeding activities, so that all more than one million eligible female animals in the province will be fully pregnant by the end of April.
    In order to ensure the completion of the task of selecting breeds, breeding, and breeding young animals, the people's communes have also established feeding and breeding departments, artificial insemination stations, and management areas have established livestock feeding and breeding committees, and production teams have established feeding groups to regularly conduct livestock feeding and breeding inspections and research. Many areas have convened summary commendation and comparison meetings for livestock feeding and breeding, selected more than 20,000 excellent strong breeding animals, and established a high-quality seed base. Veterinary stations in various places have also organized mobile breeding stations to go deep into the society and teams to carry out breeding work.

    (Our newspaper, Fuzhou, 22nd) Many places in Fujian Province have adopted three major measures of breeding, improving feeding management, and preventing and controlling diseases to vigorously develop poultry and livestock production and have achieved remarkable results.
    Many people's communes have implemented the policy of self-breeding and self-raising, and launched a movement for full pregnancy of female animals. In terms of poultry and livestock management, according to incomplete statistics from forty-two counties, the existing reserves of silage and fermented feed have increased by more than two times compared with the same period last year. The feeding management of poultry and livestock in various counties generally adopts the establishment of pig farms and poultry farms, the establishment of professional teams, and the establishment of a responsibility system and reward methods to vigorously develop collective breeding undertakings.
    Many people's communes have established livestock health rooms and animal husbandry veterinary stations. At present, the province has more than 20,000 veterinarians and epidemic prevention workers. (Attached picture)

    抓紧春季给牲畜配种
    黑龙江力争牲畜大群丰产
    本报哈尔滨22日电  黑龙江省今年要在全省范围内开展一个“双满”（大家畜满怀、满膘）、“一无”（无畜疫）、“五全”（牲畜全配、全准、全产、全活、全壮）、“十大养”（大养马、驴、骡、耕牛、奶牛、猪、羊、鸡、鸭、兔）的大群丰产运动，发展畜牧业生产。这是中共黑龙江省委、省人民委员会目前正在联合举行的全省农业、畜牧工作会议上提出的。今年全省的马将要比去年增长18％，牛要比去年增长22.4％，奶牛比去年增长75.9％，绵羊增长89.1％，猪增长143.8％，家禽（包括鸡、鸭）增长566％。光是猪、家禽今年发展的数量，就等于全省农村人口平均每人养一口猪、十只鸡（鸭）。
    目前各地畜牧工作部门正在猛抓牲畜配种工作。省有关部门去年冬季为各县培训了一千五百名牲畜人工授精的师资，今年1月间，这些人又为各人民公社培训了大批人工授精的技术员。这些农民配种技术员正在将母马集中，有的准备配种，有的已经开始配种。为了保证实现今年跃进计划，各公社已经普遍建起综合配种站，形成了一个配种网，并采取精液低温保存，推行母畜集中繁殖，以作到适时配、常年配、多次配、重复配，保证母畜全配，全配准。全省今年生下来的小母猪，体质好的，今年都留做繁殖母猪；今年上半年生产的鸡蛋，采取“先少吃，后多吃”，拿出一半来孵化小鸡。
    为保证今年牲畜大发展，还加强对牲畜疫病防治工作。各地畜牧部门将继续大力开展群众性防疫运动，建立防疫卫生制度，实行封锁、隔离、消毒、毁尸的防疫措施，特别是进行定期全面防疫注射和检疫，保证今年实现无疫省。加强饲料和饲养管理工作。贮存一切可以利用的农副产品作牲畜饲料，大搞青贮饲料，保护和改良草原，提高产草量，大量贮存野草野菜，种植高产饲料作物，常年供应牲畜养分丰富的青绿饲料。牲畜饲养管理工作，将继续推行责任制度和实行技术革新，普遍推行老、弱、妊畜分类小槽饲养的方法，保护牲畜。
