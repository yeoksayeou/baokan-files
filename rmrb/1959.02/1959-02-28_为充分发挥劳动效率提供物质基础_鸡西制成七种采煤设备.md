    Jixi Manufactures Seven Types of Coal Mining Equipment
    (Xinhua News Agency, Jixi) The Jixi Mining Machinery Plant recently successfully trial-produced seven new models of coal mining machinery. These include Jixi-type and Dongfeng-type combined coal mining machines, Dongfeng-type cutting and loading machines, and coal loading machines for coal mining faces. This lays a material foundation for increasing labor efficiency.
    These coal mining equipment have many advantages. The Jixi-type combined coal mining machine is equipped with sturdy crushing teeth, which can be used for coal mining in coal seams with high hardness. Its production capacity is also very high, capable of mining 150 tons of coal per hour. Its weight is one-third lighter than the Donbass-type combined coal mining machine, which greatly reduces production costs.
    This factory will mass-produce these new products this year; for some old products that are still being produced, the design structure will be comprehensively and systematically improved. Since December of last year, the design structure of five main coal mining and tunneling machines, such as the miner-type thin coal seam combined coal mining machine and the pneumatic rock grab, have been comprehensively improved. For example, the original pneumatic rock grab used a piston-type pneumatic device. The piston's leather pad was not wear-resistant, easily damaged, and the processing of this device was extremely complicated. Now, it has been changed to a gear-type pneumatic device, which is both durable and saves man-hours and steel. This provides an important guarantee for fully utilizing labor efficiency without increasing equipment or personnel.

    为充分发挥劳动效率提供物质基础
    鸡西制成七种采煤设备
    据新华社鸡西电　鸡西矿山机械厂最近试制成功了七种新型号的采煤机械。其中有鸡西型和东风型联合采煤机、东风型截装机、采煤工作面装煤机等。为提高劳动效率奠定了物质基础。
    这些采煤设备有很多优点。鸡西型联合采煤机装有坚固的破碎齿，能在硬度较高的煤层采煤，它的生产能力也很高，每小时可采煤一百五十吨，体重比顿巴斯型联合采煤机轻三分之一，因此生产成本大大降低。
    这个厂今年将大批生产这些新产品；对于继续生产的一些老产品，则全面系统地改进设计结构。去年12月份以来，已经全面改进了矿工型薄煤层联合采煤机、汽力抓岩机等五种主要采煤和掘进机械的设计结构。如原设计的汽力抓岩机采用的是活塞式气动装置，活塞的皮垫不耐磨，容易损坏，而且这种装置加工又极为复杂，现在改为齿轮式汽动装置，既耐用又能节省工时和钢材。这对不增设备不增人，充分发挥劳动效率，提供了重要保证。
