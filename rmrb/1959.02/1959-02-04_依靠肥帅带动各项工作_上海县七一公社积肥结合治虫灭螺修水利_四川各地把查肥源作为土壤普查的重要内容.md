    Relying on Fertilizer as the Leader to Drive All Work
    Shanghai County's Qiyi Commune Combines Fertilizer Accumulation with Pest Control, Snail Eradication, and Water Conservancy Construction
    Sichuan Various Regions Regard Investigating Fertilizer Sources as an Important Part of Soil Survey
    (Our Newspaper) Shanghai County's Qiyi People's Commune takes fertilizer accumulation as the center, closely combining it with pest control, snail eradication, and water conservancy construction, achieving multiple goals with one action. It has not only accumulated a large amount of fertilizer but also ensured the smooth progress of various tasks.
    In addition to planting cotton and rice, this commune is rich in vegetables, supplying one-third of the vegetables consumed by Shanghai citizens. Water conservancy for irrigation, drainage, and transportation is particularly urgent, so this year's water conservancy tasks are very heavy. At the same time, plant diseases, insect pests, and the host snails of schistosomiasis all need to be eliminated this winter. Currently, all tasks must be guaranteed for a greater leap forward, and the labor force is relatively tight. After studying the overall situation, the commune's Party committee believes that it is entirely possible to closely combine fertilizer accumulation with the above tasks, so it consulted with relevant departments of the commune and decided to take fertilizer accumulation as the leader to drive the rest. More than 10,000 laborers were rationally arranged from the existing 27,000 agricultural laborers and divided into four armies to carry out the work.
    These four armies are full of vigor and show their unique abilities. The first army, consisting of thousands of people, dredges waterways in nearly a hundred rivers and streams every day, while also digging up a large amount of soil fertilizer to send to the fields. The second army, consisting of thousands of commune members, takes hoes and removes weeds in front of and behind houses, on graves, along roads, and in fields, destroying the old homes of aphids, rice borers, cotton bollworms, and other pests while also using the weeds as compost. They also carry out a major cleanup in cotton warehouses and pull out rice roots in the fields to eliminate cotton bollworms and rice borers. Another army dredges the forty rivers and streams that still have snails, drains the river water, digs up a large amount of river mud, and shovels three or four inches of soil around the riverbanks to leave the snails nowhere to hide. At the same time, the weeds shoveled down are also made into compost, and the mud from the bottom of the river is used as soil fertilizer.
    After this work, which centers on fertilizer accumulation and combines pest control, snail eradication, and water conservancy construction, was carried out, it achieved multiple goals and flourished in all directions. Now, millions of dan of fertilizer are accumulated every day. By January 28, 9.8 million dan of fertilizer had been accumulated, completing nearly 50% of the fertilizer accumulation target. In terms of water conservancy construction, more than twenty large and small rivers and streams have recently been dredged. In terms of eliminating snails, one-third of the commune was originally an area where schistosomiasis was prevalent. After this large-scale fertilizer accumulation combined with snail eradication, it is expected that schistosomiasis can be completely eradicated in the near future. In terms of pest control, the weeds on more than 5,000 mu of land have been removed, and the weeding work is still being further carried out, which will play a greater role in protecting plants and reducing pests this year.

    (Xinhua News Agency) Since the soil survey work started in various parts of Sichuan last December, good results have been achieved in both fertilizer accumulation and soil survey due to close links with the winter fertilizer accumulation and production movement.
    Thousands of farmer technicians participated in this soil survey. They all listed the investigation of fertilizer sources as an important task. The Peng'an County survey team recently discovered nine kinds of mineral fertilizers and organic fertilizers in dozens of places in one month. Among them, the peat reserves reached more than 50 million dan, and there were also many phosphate rocks. Various mineral fertilizers are enough for the county to develop a large number of local chemical fertilizer production. Yibin Prefecture, in conjunction with the soil survey, discovered 27 kinds of large mineral and plant fertilizers by the end of last year, including phosphate mines in seven counties and peat in six counties. At present, the region is using these fertilizer sources to accumulate and produce a large amount of fertilizer. Many communes have established local chemical fertilizer factories and produced a large amount of local chemical fertilizer.
    The soil survey work in various places paid close attention to starting from the fields where spring crops are planted. While investigating the soil, they also conducted investigations on seedlings and fertilizer requirements. This "three investigation" method greatly promoted "accumulating fertilizer according to the soil" and "applying fertilizer according to the soil." Langzhong County found that more than 50,000 mu of cultivated land was acidic and urgently needed phosphorus and potassium fertilizers. The county immediately launched a movement to rush to produce phosphorus and potassium fertilizers and applied them to the fields in a timely manner. In addition, a large amount of lime was also produced to transform some excessively acidic land. Some places set up "production inspection teams" in the soil survey team to find loopholes and make suggestions for the establishment of "field archives" for high-yield spring crop fields. Some places in Nanchong Prefecture found that wheat seedlings were not growing well on some excessively alkaline land. After urgently applying nitrogen fertilizer, the growth of the seedlings changed within three days.
    Many communes, based on soil and natural conditions, have carried out land planning for spring rice and other crops in a timely manner and put forward fertilizer application plans. This has further strengthened the planning of the fertilizer accumulation movement.
    The farmer technicians who participated in the survey teams in various places regarded the political mobilization work of fertilizer accumulation as part of their work. They used their own experiences to teach commune members knowledge about fertilizers and soil problems while surveying the soil and imparting technology. In the past, some farmers in various places were afraid that applying too much fertilizer would cause crops to lodge. After listening to the publicity, they understood the truth and their enthusiasm for accumulating and producing fertilizer was greatly improved.

    依靠肥帅带动各项工作
    上海县七一公社积肥结合治虫灭螺修水利
    四川各地把查肥源作为土壤普查的重要内容
    本报讯　上海县七一人民公社以积肥为中心，紧紧结合治虫、灭螺和兴修水利，做到一举数得，不仅积攒了大量肥料，并使各项工作都顺利进展。
    这个公社种植棉、稻以外，盛产蔬菜，上海市民吃的蔬菜三分之一由这里供应，水利灌溉排涝运输要求特别紧迫，因此今年水利任务很重。同时，植物病虫害和血吸虫的寄主钉螺都需要在今冬扑灭，而目前各项工作又要保证更大跃进，劳动力相当紧张，该公社党委研究全面情况之后，认为以积肥为主和上述各项工作密切结合起来是完全可以的，就与公社有关部门商量，决定积肥挂帅，带动其余，从现有的二万七千个农业劳动力中抽出一万多劳动力来合理安排，分成四路大军进行。
    这四路大军雄姿焕发，各显神通。第一路数千名大军每天在近百条河浜疏浚河道，同时又挖出大量的土肥，送到田里。第二路大军，上千名社员拿着锄头，在宅前宅后、坟墓上、路旁、田间除杂草，捣毁蚜虫、螟虫、红铃虫等各种害虫的老家，同时又把杂草作为堆肥。他们还在棉花仓库里大扫除，在田里拔掉稻根，消灭红铃虫、螟虫。另一路大军，在四十条尚有钉螺的河浜，抽干河水，把大量河泥挖上来，河旁周围又铲土三、四寸，使钉螺无处藏身，同时又把铲下来的杂草也作成堆肥，把河底的泥作为土肥。
    这个以积肥为中心的结合治虫、灭螺、兴修水利等工作开展以后，一举数得，四面开花。现在每天积肥成百万担，到1月28日止，就积肥九百八十万担，完成积肥数近50％。在兴修水利方面，最近有二十多条大小河浜疏浚完毕。在消灭钉螺方面，该公社原来有三分之一地区是血吸虫病流行区，经过这次大搞积肥结合灭螺，可以预计血吸虫病可以在近期彻底根除。在治虫方面，已有五千多亩土地上的杂草铲除尽，现在除草工作还在进一步开展，这将对今年保护植物、减少虫害起更大的作用。（王洪仙）
    据新华社讯　四川各地从去年12月开始的土壤普查工作，由于同冬季积肥造肥运动紧密联系进行，积肥和土壤普查都得到很好的效果。
    这次土壤普查，有成千上万的农民技术员参加。他们都把查肥源列为一项重要内容。蓬安县的普查队最近一个月中就在几十个地方找出了九种矿物肥和有机肥，其中泥炭储量达五千多万担，磷矿石也不少，各种矿肥足够全县大量发展土化肥生产之用。宜宾专区结合土壤普查，到去年年底发现了大宗矿肥、植物肥二十七种，其中磷矿遍及七个县，泥炭遍及六个县。目前，全区正利用这些肥源大量积肥造肥，很多公社办起了土化肥厂，生产了大量土化肥。
    各地的土壤普查工作，十分注意先从种植小春作物的田地开始，在查土壤的同时，进行查苗、查需肥。这种“三查”的办法大大推动了“看土积肥”和“看土施肥”。阆中县查出有五万多亩耕地偏酸，急需磷钾肥料，全县立即掀起赶造磷钾肥运动，及时施到地里，另外还生产了大量石灰，改造部分酸性过重的地。有些地方在土壤普查队中专设“生产检查组”，找漏洞，提建议，为小春高产田建立“田间档案”。南充专区有的地方发现有部分碱性过重的地小麦生长不好，经过急施氮肥，三天便改变了小苗的生长情况。
    不少公社根据土壤和自然条件，及时进行了大春水稻等作物的土地规划工作，提出施肥计划。这也进一步加强了积肥运动的计划性。
    各地参加普查队的农民技术员们，把积肥的政治鼓动工作看成自己工作的一部分。他们现身说法，边查土壤，边向社员讲授有关肥料和土壤问题的知识，边传授技术。过去，各地都有一些农民怕多施肥庄稼倒伏，听了宣传后，懂得了其中的道理，积造肥料积极性大为提高。
