A new battle to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production this year has begun in full swing! The people of the whole country are striving to achieve the four major production increase targets of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, as well as other corresponding production increase targets. Such a situation of a mighty army marching forward victoriously puts extremely heavy and glorious tasks on transportation work. The transportation volume of steel, coal, grain, and cotton usually accounts for about 50% of the total railway transportation volume, about 60% of the total highway transportation volume, and about 40% of the total water transportation volume. The leap forward in the production of steel, coal, grain, and cotton will inevitably bring greater transport volume to transportation; moreover, to ensure the realization of the four major targets of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, the transport volume of pig iron, ore, timber, fertilizer, pesticides, and agricultural machinery will also greatly increase. The transportation departments must shoulder the heavy responsibility of being the "vanguard" and be a good pioneer for the realization of the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain and cotton and the greater leap forward of the entire national economy.

The exact increase in this year's freight volume cannot be estimated at present, but according to general rules, it is likely to double. In recent years, China's transportation capacity has continued to develop. In particular, last year, the policy of the whole party and the whole people running transportation was implemented, and the transportation capacity has greatly increased. Last year, the mileage of new railway lines and double-track laying completed reached 2,300 kilometers, which is double the total length of new railways built in 1957; at the same time, the earthwork and stone work of roadbeds and some bridge projects on more than 3,000 kilometers of railways have been basically completed. In terms of highways, 150,000 kilometers were newly built last year alone (including simple highways), which is equivalent to 180% of the total mileage of new highways built during the first five-year plan. In terms of water transport, about 10,000 kilometers of waterways were opened and improved. In terms of civil aviation, more than 6,000 kilometers of local routes were opened, which is more than the total increase during the first five-year plan. While railways, highways, waterways, and airports are being built, locomotives, vehicles, ships, and airplanes have all increased to varying degrees. However, facing the more arduous transportation tasks this year, the existing transportation capacity is still insufficient. This requires all employees of the transportation department to muster greater efforts and make greater efforts than last year to complete and overfulfill this year's transportation tasks.

Transportation includes two aspects: transportation and transportation construction. We must do both of these tasks well at the same time, doing both transportation and transportation construction, in order to complete this year's transportation tasks. Carrying out transportation construction is the basic method of increasing transportation capacity. We must seize the time to build new railways, highways, stations, ports, and airports, open up new routes, and manufacture new vehicles and ships. When grasping transportation construction, the most important thing is to concentrate our efforts on the most urgently needed projects. At present, in terms of railways, we must seize the technical transformation of existing railway trunk lines, especially the construction of the Jinpu and Jingguang double lines, the construction of certain dedicated lines, branch lines, hub stations, and the transformation and manufacture of locomotives and vehicles. In terms of highways, we must seize the expansion of the manufacturing capacity of trailers and auto parts, and use the method of "long-term preparation, short-term shock" to build more and better highways. In terms of water transportation, we must seize port construction, increase berth positions, loading and unloading machinery, and warehouse stacking yards, and expand the port's throughput capacity. In terms of civil aviation, we must seize the construction of airports.

Seizing transportation construction and striving for new transportation lines and new transportation equipment to be put into production as soon as possible is an important aspect of completing this year's transportation tasks, but we cannot place all our hopes for completing this year's transportation tasks on newly added transportation capacity. The transportation equipment and transportation tools planned to be added this year are not only insufficient in quantity to fully meet objective requirements, but most of them cannot be put into production in the first half of the year. Therefore, grasping transportation organization work, tapping the potential of existing transportation equipment, and improving transportation efficiency are still the most effective and most important measures to complete this year's transportation tasks. Last year, there was great progress in transportation organization work, especially in the queueing of materials, comprehensive utilization of various transportation methods, and the connection between long-distance transportation and short-distance transportation. However, there are still many areas for improvement in certain links of transportation organization work. As long as we continue to work hard in planning transportation, rational transportation, material queueing, comprehensive utilization of various transportation methods, and organizing transportation cooperation in the future, strengthen cargo source organization work, improve the accuracy of planning, reduce unreasonable transportation, reduce empty driving rates, and accelerate the turnover of vehicles and ships, we can tap more transportation potential and complete more transportation tasks with the same transportation capacity.

Both transportation work and transportation construction work must carry out mass movements in a big way, and adopt the method of combining professional teams and the broad masses to develop the transportation industry. This is the key to transporting more, faster, better, and more economically, and building transportation construction more, faster, better, and more economically. Professional transportation teams are the backbone of the national transportation industry, and there is no doubt that they will continue to grow and develop in the future. However, the scope of transportation is very wide. Wherever there are people and production, there must be transportation. Such a broad social need cannot be handled solely by professional transportation teams. Only by carrying out mass movements in a big way and combining the strength of professional teams and the broad masses can we shoulder the ever-increasing transport volume due to the continuous development of social production. Last year, the whole country carried out water conservancy projects and steel production in a big way. Thousands of remote mountain areas with traffic blockages were transformed into the front lines of production and construction. If it were not for carrying out mass movements in a big way and combining the strength of professional teams and the broad masses, turning roads into existence, turning stagnant water into living water, and winning huge victories in water conservancy construction and steel production with bustling traffic and a thousand sails competing? Last year, steel, coal, grain, and cotton were all increased several times. Whether it was trunk line transportation or branch line transportation, long-distance transportation or short-distance transportation, the transportation volume increased sharply. If it were not for carrying out mass movements in a big way and combining the strength of professional teams and the broad masses, how could we guarantee the comprehensive leap forward of industrial and agricultural production? This year, facing the more arduous transportation tasks and transportation construction tasks, we must also further carry out mass movements in a big way and better combine the strength of professional teams and the broad masses. At present, there is a mass transportation team in all regions. The current task is to rectify, consolidate and improve this team. In the new steel production bases, we should adopt methods such as determining tasks, tools, routes, personnel, and leadership to fix the steel transportation team that needs to be fixed, and make it a capable professional team. In stations, ports, and cities, we should effectively organize the necessary reserve teams that do not leave their original production, according to needs. In people's communes, we should also establish a professional or part-time transportation team with both workers and peasants, according to actual needs, along with the industrialization and diversified economic development of the communes.

Continuing to carry out mass movements in a big way on the transportation front should focus on carrying out technological revolution. At present, the intensity of physical labor on the transportation front is still very high, and it still occupies a lot of labor. Whether it is road construction, river digging, handling, or loading and unloading, it often requires hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of people to participate. Last year, various regions mobilized a large number of people to rush to transport backlog materials and open up new roads. This was necessary under the objective situation of large transport volume, rapid momentum, tight time, wide distribution, and many changes at that time, and it also played a huge role; however, this method can only be adopted when rushing emergency tasks. If this is done frequently, the transportation industry will occupy too much labor force, which will inevitably affect the arrangement of the national labor force. The only way to use less people and do more things is to carry out technological revolution and improve labor productivity. In the technological revolution, we must implement the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and adopt both the latest technological achievements and the technology that combines indigenous and foreign methods. In the past year, the vast number of employees on the transportation front have already made great achievements in improving equipment, improving tools, and improving technical operations. Indigenous railways, indigenous humps, high platforms, low cargo positions, automobile trains, semi-mechanization of wooden sailing ships, cableway transportation, wooden rail transportation, eight-sided sails, etc., have all significantly improved transportation efficiency. We must vigorously support these new creations, conscientiously summarize and mobilize the masses to continue to create various advanced experiences that are more, faster, better, and more economical, and promote them in a timely manner.

To develop the transportation industry more, faster, better, and more economically, we must give full play to the initiative of local governments. Every county, and even every people's commune, must have transportation lines and their own transportation tools, so we must pay attention to giving play to the initiative of local governments, and even every people's commune. At the same time, we must also see that the transportation industry also has the characteristics of concentration and unification. Without centralized and unified leadership, everyone acting on their own, it would be difficult for the transportation industry to play its role. Therefore, the transportation industry must implement the idea of "the whole country as a chessboard", and combine strengthening centralized leadership and giving play to local initiative well. According to the principle of ensuring key points and taking care of general needs, materials should be queued and transportation should be organized according to their importance and urgency. To this end, we must strengthen plan management and comprehensively arrange annual, quarterly, and monthly transportation plans. The transportation authorities in various regions should study the requirements of industrial and agricultural production and commodity circulation in their regions for transportation, find out the flow and direction of goods, verify the consignment plan, rationally arrange transport capacity, organize the comprehensive utilization of various transportation methods, and integrate railways, highways, shipping, trunk lines and branch lines, modern transportation tools and folk transportation tools, professional transportation forces and social transportation forces of organs, enterprises, schools, etc., as well as the transportation forces of the people's communes, into a unified plan, and make overall arrangements to ensure the transportation of key materials and take care of the transportation of general materials.

In addition to doing a good job in freight transportation, we must also vigorously do a good job in passenger transportation. With the development of economic construction, the volume of passenger transportation will inevitably increase greatly. For example, this year's Spring Festival passenger transportation reached tens of millions of passengers. Whether passenger transportation is done well or not not only affects millions of passengers, but also affects production and construction. Therefore, while grasping freight transportation, we must also actively improve passenger transportation.

Transportation has an inseparable connection with industrial and agricultural production and people's lives. Not only is the circulation process following the production process inseparable from transportation, but the production process of industrial and agricultural products is also inseparable from transportation. The transfer of products and semi-finished products from one production site to another in industrial production requires a transportation process; in agricultural production, the transportation of fertilizers to the fields also requires a transportation process. Therefore, the party committees in various regions must also earnestly grasp transportation work while grasping industry and agriculture. Transportation has close connections with various departments of social production, involves a wide range of aspects, and many problems cannot be solved by one department alone. Only under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels can we make overall arrangements to do a good job in transportation. We believe that under the leadership of party committees at all levels, all comrades in the transportation department and the broad masses of people will pool their wisdom and efforts, and the transportation work will surely have a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, and will surely be a good pioneer for the realization of the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton and the greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward of the entire national economy!

    做好开路先锋
    一个争取今年工农业生产更大更好更全面跃进的新的战役轰轰烈烈地开始了！全国人民正为实现钢、煤、粮、棉四大增产指标以及其他相应的增产指标而奋斗。这样的千军万马乘胜前进的形势，对交通运输工作提出了十分繁重同时也十分光荣的任务。钢、煤、粮、棉这四种物资的运量通常在铁路运输总量中占50％左右，在公路运输总量中占60％左右，在水上运输总量中占40％左右。钢、煤、粮、棉生产的跃进，必然给交通运输带来更大的运量；而且，要保证钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标的实现，生铁、矿石、木材、肥料、农药、农业机械的运量也会有很大的增长。交通运输部门必须担负起“先行官”的重任，为实现钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标及整个国民经济的更大跃进做好开路先锋。
    今年的货运量究竟将增长多少，目前还预计不出来，根据一般规律来推算，翻一番恐怕是少不了的。几年来，我国的交通运输力量不断发展，特别是去年贯彻了全党全民办交通的方针，交通运输力量有了巨大的增长。去年一年完成的铁路新线和复线铺轨里程达二千三百公里，比1957年新建铁路总长增加了一倍；同时还有三千公里以上的铁路基本上完成了路基土石方工程和部分桥梁工程。公路方面，去年一年就新建了十五万公里（包括简易公路），相当于第一个五年计划期间新建公路里程总和的180％。水上运输方面，开辟和整治航道一万公里左右，民用航空方面，开辟了地方航线六千多公里，都比第一个五年计划期间增长的总和还多。在铁路、公路、航道、机场建设的同时，机车、车辆、船舶、飞机都有不同程度的增长。但是，面对着今年更加繁重的运输任务，现有的交通运输力量还是不够的。这就要求交通运输部门的全体职工鼓起更大的干劲，比去年作更大的努力，以完成和超额完成今年的交通运输任务。
    交通运输包括两个方面：一是运输，一是交通建设。必须把这两方面的工作同时做好，既做好运输，又做好交通建设，才能完成今年的运输任务。进行交通建设，是增加运输力量的基本方法。我们一定要抓紧修建新的铁路、公路、车站、港口、机场，开拓新的航线，制造新的车辆、船舶。在抓紧交通建设的时候，最重要的是集中力量抓最急需的项目。目前，在铁路方面，要抓紧现有铁路干线的技术改造，特别是津浦、京广复线的建设、某些专用线、支线、枢纽站的建设和机车车辆的改造与制造。在公路方面，要抓紧扩大挂车和汽车配件的制造能力，并用“长期准备，短期突击”的办法修建更多更好的公路。在水上运输方面，要抓紧港口建设，增加码头泊位、装卸机械和仓库堆场，扩大港口的通过能力。在民用航空方面，要抓紧机场的建设工程。
    抓紧交通建设，力争新的交通线路和新的交通设备早日投入生产，这是完成今年运输任务的一个重要方面，但不能把完成今年运输任务的希望全部放在新增加运输能力上面。今年计划增加的交通设备、运输工具不仅数量上还不能完全适应客观要求，而且大部分上半年还不能投入生产。因此，抓紧运输组织工作，挖掘现有运输设备的潜力，提高运输效率，仍然是完成今年运输任务最有效的也是最主要的措施。去年，运输组织工作有很大的进步，特别是在物资排队、综合利用各种运输方式、长途运输和短途运输的衔接方面做出了很好的成绩。但是，在运输组织工作的某些环节上仍有不少可以改进的地方。只要今后在计划运输、合理运输、物资排队、综合利用各种运输方式、组织运输协作等方面继续努力，加强货源组织工作，提高计划的准确性，减少不合理的运输，减少空驶率，加速车辆、船舶的周转，就可以挖掘更多的运输潜力，用同样的运输力量完成更多的运输任务。
    运输工作和交通建设工作都要大搞群众运动，采取专业队伍和广大群众相结合的办法发展交通运输事业。这是运输运得多快好省、交通建设建得多快好省的关键。专业交通运输队伍是国家交通事业中的骨干力量，今后要继续发展壮大，这是毫无疑问的。但是，运输的范围非常广泛，有人、有生产的地方就要有运输，这样广阔的社会需要，是单纯依靠专业运输队伍包办不了的。只有大搞群众运动，把专业队伍的力量和广大群众的力量结合起来，才能担负起由于社会生产不断发展而日益增长的运输量。去年全国大修水利，大办钢铁，千万处交通闭塞的荒山僻野变成了生产建设的前线，若不是大搞群众运动，把专业队伍的力量和广大群众的力量结合起来，变无路为有路，变死水为活水，车水马龙，千帆竞发，哪能赢得水利建设和钢铁生产的巨大胜利？去年钢、煤、粮、棉样样加番，无论干线运输或支线运输，长途运输或短途运输，运量莫不激增，若不是大搞群众运动，把专业队伍的力量和广大群众的力量结合起来，哪能保证工农业生产的全面跃进？今年，面对着更加繁重的运输任务和交通建设任务，也必须进一步大搞群众运动，把专业队伍的力量和广大群众的力量更好地结合起来。现在，各地都有一支群众性的交通运输队伍。目前的任务是要对这支队伍进行整顿、巩固和提高。在新的钢铁生产基地，应该采取定任务、定工具、定线路、定人员、定领导等办法，把需要固定的钢铁运输队伍固定下来，使它成为一支精干的专业队伍。在车站、港口、城市，应该根据需要，把必要的、不脱离原来生产的后备队伍切实地组织起来。在人民公社，也应该随着公社工业化和多种经济的发展，根据实际需要，建立一支专业的或者亦工亦农的运输队伍。
    在交通运输战线上继续大搞群众运动，应当以开展技术革命为中心。目前，交通运输战线上体力劳动的强度还很高，占用劳动力还很多。无论是修路、挖河，无论是搬运、装卸，动辄都需要成百、成千、成万的人参加。去年，各地动员大批群众抢运积压物资，开拓新的道路。这在当时运量大、来势猛、时间紧、分布广、变化多的客观形势下，是必要的，而且也起了巨大的作用；但是，这种办法毕竟只是突击紧急任务的时候可以采用，经常这样做，交通运输业占用的劳动力过多，势必影响到全国劳动力的安排。人要少用，事情还要多做，唯一的办法就是开展技术革命，提高劳动生产率。在技术革命中要贯彻土洋并举的方针，既要采用最新的技术成就，也要采用土洋结合的技术。去年一年中，广大交通运输战线上的职工已经在改进设备、改进工具、改进技术操作等方面取得了很大的成就。土铁路、土驼峰、高站台、低货位、汽车列车化、木帆船半机械化、索道运输、木轨运输、八面风帆等等，都显著地提高了运输效率。我们一定要大力支持这些新的创造，认真总结并且发动群众继续创造各种多快好省的先进经验，及时推广。
    要多快好省地发展交通运输事业，必须充分发挥地方的积极性。每一个县，直至每一个人民公社，都要有交通线路和自己的交通运输工具，因而必须注意发挥地方的，乃至每一个人民公社的积极性。同时，也必须看到，交通运输事业又具有集中性、统一性的特点，没有集中统一的领导，大家各自为政，交通运输事业就很难发挥作用。因此，交通运输事业必须贯彻“全国一盘棋”的思想，把加强集中领导和发挥地方积极性很好地结合起来，根据保证重点、照顾一般的原则，对物资进行排队，分别轻重缓急组织运输。为此，就要加强计划管理，全面安排年度、季度、每月的运输计划。各地运输主管部门要研究本地区工农业生产和商品流转对运输的要求，摸清货物的流量、流向，核实托运计划，合理安排运力，组织各种运输方式的综合利用，将铁路、公路、航运，干线和支线，近代运输工具和民间运输工具，专业运输力量和机关、企业、学校等社会运输力量，以及人民公社的运输力量，全部纳入统一的计划内，进行统筹安排，来保证重点物资的运输，并且照顾一般物资的运输。
    除了做好货运工作之外，还要大力做好客运工作。随着经济建设的发展，客运量也必然会有很大的增长，例如今年春节旅客运输就达几千万人次。客运工作做得好不好，不但影响千百万旅客，而且也会影响到生产和建设。因此，在抓紧货运工作的同时，还要积极改进客运工作。
    交通运输同工农业生产，同人民生活之间都有着不可分割的联系。不但继生产过程之后的流通过程离不开运输，而且工农业产品的生产过程中也离不开运输。工业生产中产品和半成品从一个生产场所转移到另一个生产场所，要有一个运输过程；农业生产中把肥料运到田里去，也要有一个运输过程。因此，各地党委要在抓工业和抓农业的同时，也把交通运输工作认真地抓起来。交通运输同社会生产各个部门都有密切的联系，牵涉的面很广，许多问题都不是一个部门能够解决的，也只有在各级党委的统一领导下，全面安排，才能把交通运输工作做好。我们相信，在各级党委的领导下，交通运输部门全体同志和广大人民群策群力，交通运输工作一定能有更大更好更全面的跃进，一定能为钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标的实现和整个国民经济的更大更好更全面的跃进做好开路先锋！
