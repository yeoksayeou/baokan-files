Xinhua News Agency, January 31st: The Jingxi Mining Bureau today exceeded its January coal production plan of 451,500 tons, firing the first shot in this year's production leap forward.

    As early as the end of last year, the Bureau's Party committee mobilized workers from all mines to discuss the coal production plan for the first quarter and January of this year, and formulated specific measures to complete the plan. The miners were all confident and motivated, and a production competition was launched between sections, shifts, and individuals throughout the mine. The Party Secretary and Director of the Mining Bureau personally went to each mine to check on safe production at the beginning of the year. The heads of each mine and the cadres of each section also frequently went down the well to work alongside the miners, promptly identifying and solving key problems in production.

    In order to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the coal production plan for the first ten days of February, the mines under the Jingxi Mining Bureau recently held workers' congresses to discuss the plan for the first ten days of February and formulate specific measures. The miners posted big-character posters expressing their determination, taking the call of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee to adhere to production until the last minute before the Spring Festival and to strive for full attendance after the Spring Festival as their slogan.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 31st: After the workers of the Shanghai Diesel Engine Plant saw off the great leap forward year of 1958, all the workers of the plant sharpened their swords and rested for two days, then continued to be full of energy and plunged into the new battle, overfulfilling the production task of the first month of the new year, producing fifty more diesel engines than originally planned.

    As early as the end of last year, the Shanghai Diesel Engine Plant mobilized all the workers to make various preparations for the great leap forward in production this year in terms of product design, process compilation, and the manufacturing of indigenous equipment. At the beginning of the new year, the masses were mobilized to discuss the production plan for January and the first quarter. Each workshop and group came up with ideas and measures based on the task, and formulated plans. In mid-January, Party organizations at all levels also conducted timely inspections, further boosting the enthusiasm of all the workers. The oil pump workshop, which is responsible for manufacturing the heart of the diesel engine – the oil supply system, launched a vigorous competition between shifts and groups. In the competition of catching up with each other, all the workers of the plant continued to make great technical innovations, further improving production efficiency.

    In order to ensure a greater leap forward this year, the production of diesel engine plant products is developing in the direction of high-grade and precision. While completing production tasks in January, the plant also armed itself with indigenous equipment. In January, the diesel engine workshop had finalized twenty-six kinds of indigenous machine tools and produced thirty-two sets.

    Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, January 31st: The workers of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant completed the January production plan ahead of schedule on the 30th. The locomotive output increased by nearly one-third compared with the same period last year.

    In order to explore the laws of the great leap forward, the factory launched a bottom-up great summary, great inspection, and great appraisal movement at the end of last year, and also held a great leap forward exhibition and advanced experience performances. Through these activities, the workers further realized that making great efforts is the decisive factor in promoting the great leap forward in production. Based on summarizing last year's experience, the workers comprehensively analyzed the favorable conditions for this year's great leap forward, proposed the goal of doubling the output of locomotives and rolling stock this year, and immediately began designing and trial-producing 7,000-horsepower internal combustion locomotives and other new products.

    Through this mass summary, inspection, and appraisal, the factory also selected more than 600 red flag bearers. Under the slogan of "Heroes emerge in the face of difficulties," the workers launched a friendly competition of learning from, comparing with, and catching up with advanced workers, which played a significant role in completing the January plan.

    打响了今年生产跃进第一炮
    京西矿务局、上海柴油机厂、大连机车厂完成一月份计划
    据新华社31日讯　京西矿务局今天超额完成了1月份四十五万一千五百吨的产煤计划，打响了今年生产跃进的第一炮。
    这个局的党委早在去年年底，就发动各矿职工讨论了今年第一季度和1月份的产煤计划，并制定了完成计划的具体措施。矿工们个个心中有底，干劲十足，全矿展开了段与段，班与班、人与人之间的生产竞赛。矿务局的党委书记、局长今年一开始就分别到各矿检查安全生产情况，各矿的负责人和各段的干部也经常下井跟班生产，及时发现与解决生产中的关键问题。
    为了保证完成和超额完成2月上旬的产煤计划，京西矿务局所属各矿最近分别召开了职工大会，讨论了2月上旬的计划，制定了具体措施。矿工们纷纷贴出大字报表示决心，他们把北京市委提出的春节前坚持生产到最后一分钟、春节开工后争取全勤生产开门红的号召，作为行动口号。
    据新华社上海31日电　上海柴油机厂工人送走了1958年大跃进年以后，全厂职工秣马厉兵，休整了两天，又精神抖擞地继续鼓足干劲投入新的战斗，超额完成新年第一月的生产任务，比原计划多生产五十台柴油机。
    上海柴油机厂早在去年年尾便发动全厂职工从产品设计、编制工艺、制造土设备方面，为今年生产大跃进作了各项准备工作。新年一开始，又发动群众讨论1月份和一季度生产计划，各个车间、小组根据任务，想办法、找措施，订出了规划。1月中旬，各级党组织并及时进行了检查，进一步鼓舞了全厂职工的干劲。担负制造柴油机心脏——输油系统的油泵车间，班与班、组与组展开了轰轰烈烈的竞赛。在你追我赶的竞赛中，全厂职工继续大闹技术革新，使生产效率进一步提高。
    为了保证今年更大跃进，柴油机厂的产品制造正朝着高级、精密方向发展。全厂1月份在完成生产任务的同时，还大搞土设备武装了自己。1月份，柴油机车间已定型了二十六种土机床，生产了三十二套。
    据新华社旅大31日电　大连机车车辆厂职工在30日提前完成了1月份的生产计划，机车产量比去年同期增产将近三分之一。
    为了探索大跃进的规律，工厂在去年底展开了自下而上的大总结、大检查、大评比运动，同时举办了大跃进展览会和先进经验表演等。通过这些活动，职工们更进一步认识到鼓足干劲是推动生产大跃进的决定因素。在总结去年经验的基础上，职工们全面分析了今年大跃进的有利条件，提出今年要使机车、车辆产量成倍增长的指标，并且立即着手设计和试制七千马力内燃机车和其他多种新产品。
    通过这次群众性的总结、检查、评比，全厂还选出了六百多名红旗手。职工们在“困难面前出英雄”的口号下，掀起了学先进、比先进、赶先进的友谊竞赛，这对完成1月份计划起了极大的作用。
