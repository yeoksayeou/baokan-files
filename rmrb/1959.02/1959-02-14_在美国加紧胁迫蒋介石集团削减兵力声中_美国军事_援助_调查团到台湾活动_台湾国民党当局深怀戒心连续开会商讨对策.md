Xinhua News Agency, 13th: Taipei News -- Amidst the intensifying coercion from the United States for the Chiang Kai-shek group to reduce its troop strength, the U.S. Military Assistance Program Investigation Group arrived in Taipei on the 11th from Seoul. This investigation group, led by Draper, Chairman of the U.S. Military Assistance Program Study Committee, held consecutive meetings with U.S. Taiwan Defense Command Commander Smoot, U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group to Taiwan Chief Doane, U.S. Ambassador to Taiwan Drumright, and others, and also contacted high-ranking officials of the Chiang Kai-shek group, including Chen Cheng, Yu Ta-wei, Yen Chia-kan, and Wang Shu-ming.

According to foreign news agency reports, the activities of this investigation group in Taiwan have already aroused the vigilance of the Chiang Kai-shek group. Before the U.S. investigation group arrived in Taiwan, the Chiang Kai-shek group convened a series of meetings to discuss countermeasures. In the past few weeks, there have been widespread rumors in Taipei that U.S. pressure to coerce the reduction of Chiang's troops is intensifying. On the eve of the U.S. military aid investigation group's arrival in Taipei, the English-language newspaper "China News," published in Taipei by the Chiang Kai-shek group, published a commentary warning the United States not to pressure Chiang's army to reduce its troop strength. The "Pan-Asia News Agency," established by Kuomintang elements in Taiwan, also said that Taiwan "will strongly oppose the U.S. demand for disarmament."

Foreign news agencies say that the Chiang Kai-shek group is now emphasizing that even with a full increase in firepower, the current 600,000 Chiang's troops are still the minimum necessary force for defending Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. At the same time, the Taiwan Kuomintang military authorities have expressed dissatisfaction with the "slow steps" taken by the United States in providing "aid," and fear that the current reduction in troops will seriously damage the morale of Chiang's troops in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. On the other hand, the United States is taking advantage of the Chiang Kai-shek group's economic difficulties, intensifying its rhetoric, accusing the Chiang Kai-shek group of squandering too much "U.S. aid." As early as January 30, United Press International reported the news of Draper's activities in Japan, saying, "Washington is particularly emphasizing the investigation group in the Far East because of the recent large expenditures in Nationalist China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group)."

Hong Kong news says that reducing the strength of Chiang's troops is one of the predetermined steps for the United States to further seize control of the Chiang Kai-shek group. This American scheme has been resisted by the Taiwan authorities. The news says that the Chiang Kai-shek group's budget deficit for the current fiscal year has reached 60 million U.S. dollars, an increase of 20 million U.S. dollars over the previous year. The United States will intensify its exploitation of the Chiang Kai-shek group's crisis, using the reduction of "U.S. aid" as a threat and the increase of some firepower as bait, to force the Chiang Kai-shek group to yield and agree to reduce Chiang's troops. This struggle between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek group is continuing to develop.

    在美国加紧胁迫蒋介石集团削减兵力声中
    美国军事“援助”调查团到台湾活动
    台湾国民党当局深怀戒心连续开会商讨对策
    新华社13日讯　台北消息：在美国胁迫蒋介石集团削减兵力声中，美国军事援助计划调查团11日由汉城到达台北。这个由美国军事援助计划研究委员会主席德莱柏率领的调查团，与侵台美军司令斯摩特、美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团团长窦恩、美国驻台湾“大使”德鲁姆赖特等接连举行会议，并且与蒋介石集团高级官员陈诚、俞大维、严家淦、王叔铭等接触。
    据外国通讯社消息，这个调查团到台湾活动，已经引起了蒋介石集团的戒心。在美国调查团抵台以前，蒋介石集团曾召开了一连串的会议，商讨对策。在过去几个星期，台北即盛传美国胁迫削减蒋军的压力正在加重。在美国军援调查团到台北的前夕，蒋介石集团在台北出版的英文报纸“中国新闻”即发表评论，警告美国不要压迫蒋军削减兵力。台湾国民党分子设立的“泛亚社”也说，台湾方面“将极力反对美国的裁军要求”。
    外国通讯社说，蒋介石集团现在强调即使充分增加火力，目前的六十万名蒋军仍是防守台、澎、金、马的最低需要额。同时，台湾国民党军事当局对美国给予“援助”时所采取的“缓慢步骤”表示不满，并且惧怕目前削减军队会严重地损害台、澎、金、马的蒋军士气。另一方面，美国却乘蒋介石集团的经济困难，加紧放出空气，指责蒋介石集团已经虚耗了太多的“美援”。早在1月30日，合众国际社报道德莱柏抵日本活动的消息中就说，“华盛顿特别着重远东的调查团，因为最近在国民党中国（指蒋介石集团）的开支很大”。
    香港消息说，削减蒋军兵力是美国进一步夺取蒋介石集团的权柄的预定步骤之一。美国这种计谋已受到台湾当局的抗拒。消息说，蒋介石集团本会计年度的预算赤字已达六千万美元，比上一年度增加了二千万美元。美国将加紧乘蒋介石集团之危，以削减“美援”为要胁，以增加一部分火力为诱饵，迫使蒋介石集团屈服，同意裁减蒋军。美国和蒋介石集团之间这场斗争，正在继续发展。
