Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: Joint Notice from the CCP Central Committee and the State Council on Launching a Spring Mating Campaign for Large Livestock:

(1) The large livestock mating work in 1958 was successful, with hundreds of counties, and a few prefectures and provinces, achieving full mating rates for eligible female animals. According to materials from various provinces, in addition to those that have already given birth before the new year, there are still about 15 million pregnant female animals, which is a good foundation for greatly improving the breeding rate of large livestock in 1959. The "Ten Initiatives" of the Agricultural Socialist Construction Advanced Units Representatives Conference proposed a target of a net increase of about 10% in large livestock in 1959, which can and must be achieved. Most provinces and regions should meet this target, and some provinces and regions with better conditions, especially mountainous and pastoral areas, should strive to exceed it. To this end, the first priority is to do a good job in feeding and managing pregnant animals, and to provide necessary care in their use based on the different lengths of pregnancy, so as not to cause miscarriages. After the birth of calves, it is necessary to effectively protect the female animals and carefully care for the calves, striving for the survival of every calf.

(2) Among large livestock, according to statistics, there are more than 27 million eligible female animals in the country. In addition to the approximately 15 million that are currently pregnant, there are still about 12 million that can be mated. It is necessary to seize the mating season in February, March, and April to launch a concentrated campaign to achieve full mating of livestock. In order to strive for more female animals to give birth in 1959, non-pregnant female animals should be mated as early as possible; female animals that give birth in the spring can also be mated immediately after giving birth, during the period when they are easily conceived. All regions should regard livestock mating work as one of the central tasks of spring production. In a spring plowing season, it is necessary to complete two sowings, one for agriculture and one for animal husbandry. People's communes must properly arrange the labor force required for livestock feeding and mating, organize professional groups, and assign dedicated personnel to be responsible. The mating season is also a busy season for spring plowing. It is necessary to prevent breeding bulls and female animals from overworking, which would affect estrus and conception, and to take into account the need for animal power in spring plowing. It is necessary to appropriately arrange the time for mating and use of animals, based on the specific conditions of each animal, taking into account both needs, so as to ensure that spring plowing and mating are not delayed. The communization of pastoral areas has created more favorable conditions for the development of livestock. Breeding and mating work should be improved compared to previous years, paying attention to selection of breeds and mating, and starting to seriously change the past phenomenon of uncontrolled and random mating. Female animals on the transportation front and female animals in mountainous and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas should be mated promptly to prevent them from remaining non-pregnant.

(3) All counties and communes should make specific plans for the concentrated spring mating, based on the number and distribution of existing breeding bulls and female animals. If breeding animals are insufficient or unevenly distributed, appropriate adjustments can be made between teams, and mating contracts can be signed between communes for mutual cooperation. From now on, breeding bulls and female animals should be fed better, and effective estrus-inducing methods should be promoted to promote estrus, improve mating ability, and increase conception rates.

    It is also necessary to vigorously develop artificial insemination to improve the utilization rate of breeding bulls and accelerate livestock breeding and improvement. In addition to making full use of existing artificial insemination equipment, successful experiences from various regions can be promoted, using local materials and indigenous methods to solve the difficulty of insufficient equipment. Where there is a shortage of artificial insemination personnel, training courses should be held in a timely manner, or apprenticeships should be used to train personnel quickly. People's communes, production brigades, and production teams should all plan to establish their own livestock mating organizations in batches. State-owned breeding farms and state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms should make full use of their existing conditions to expand the utilization rate of superior breeding animals and help nearby people's communes do a good job in livestock breeding and improvement.

(4) The estrus, mating, gestation, rearing, and use of livestock all require sufficient feed. People's communes should, based on the principle of saving grain, ensure the food supply for people on the one hand, and allocate a certain amount of concentrated feed to livestock on the other hand. All agricultural and sideline products that are scattered in the fields and yards that can be used as feed should be collected and stored for utilization to ensure the current supply of livestock feed.

    In addition, many places are preparing to return some sloping land, low-lying land, saline-alkali land, and other relatively barren land to cultivation in 1959. These returned lands should be used to plant high-yielding fodder crops and establish feed bases. Each people's commune should, with production brigades or production teams as units, make overall arrangements for the fodder and feed needed by the unit throughout the year. When formulating planting plans, fodder and feed must be included in the unified arrangements.

(5) The spring livestock mating season is short and fleeting. All regions must immediately deploy livestock mating tasks to communes and teams, adopting the methods of fixing personnel, fixing animals, fixing tasks, fixing time, and fixing quality, and do a good job in preparing for livestock mating as early as possible. And fully utilize the experience of leading agricultural production in 1958, adopt methods such as putting politics in command, broadcasting mobilization, and on-site comparisons to conscientiously mobilize the masses and immediately launch an unprecedented upsurge in livestock mating. Ensure a bumper harvest in both agriculture and animal husbandry in 1959.

    It is required that every people's commune, every animal husbandry and veterinary station, and every state-owned agricultural and pastoral farm submit a written report on the spring mating work to their directly superior organs after the end of the spring mating season, which shall be summarized by the province and reported to the Ministry of Agriculture by the end of May. Agricultural and pastoral farms directly under the Ministry of Land Reclamation shall report to the Ministry of Land Reclamation and send a copy to the Ministry of Agriculture.

                                       February 17, 1959

    中共中央和国务院联合发出通知
    开展春季大家畜配种运动
    号召精心护养母畜和照管仔畜，保证大家畜净增10％
    新华社22日讯　中共中央和国务院关于抓紧春季开展大家畜配种运动的通知
    （一）一九五八年的大家畜配种工作是有成绩的，全国出现了几百个适龄母畜满怀县，还有少数的满怀专区和满怀省。根据各省的材料，除了年前已经产仔的以外，现在还有怀孕的母畜一千五百万头左右，这是一九五九年大大提高大家畜繁殖率的良好基础。农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议的“十大倡议”提出一九五九年大家畜净增10％左右的指标，是有条件完成的，也必须完成。一般省、区都应当达到这个指标，有些省、区条件较好，特别是山区和牧区，还应当力争超过这个指标。为此，首先就要做好孕畜的饲养管理工作，在役使上也要根据怀孕时间长短不同的特点，给以必要的照顾，不使孕畜流产。在仔畜出生以后，要切实保护母畜，精心照管仔畜，力争仔畜个个成活。
    （二）在大家畜中，适龄母畜据统计全国共有二千七百多万头，除了现正怀孕的一千五百万头左右以外，还有一千二百万头左右是可以配种的，必须抓紧二、三、四月这个配种季节，开展一个牲畜配种满怀的突击运动。为了争取有较多的母畜在一九五九年内产仔，空怀的母畜要尽可能地抓紧早配；春季产仔的母畜，也可以抓紧产后容易受胎的期间，实行热配。各地都应当把牲畜配种工作当作春季生产的中心任务之一，在一个春耕季节，要完成农业和牧业的两个播种，人民公社对牲畜的饲养和配种工作所需要的劳力，必须妥善安排，组织专业小组，固定专人负责。配种紧张季节也是春耕繁忙的季节，既要不使种公畜和母畜劳动过度，影响发情和受胎，又要照顾到春耕中畜力的需要，必须根据每头牲畜的具体情况，兼顾两方面的需要，适当安排配种和使役的时间，做到春耕配种两不误。牧区公社化为发展牲畜创造了更为有利的条件，繁殖配种工作应比往年提高一步，注意选种选配，开始认真改变过去那种野交乱配的现象。运输战线上的母畜和山区、半农半牧区的散畜中的母畜，都要抓紧配种，不使空怀。
    （三）各县各社都要根据现有种公畜、母畜的数量和分布情况，做好突击春季配种的具体规划。种畜不足或分布不平衡的，队与队之间可做适当调剂，社与社之间订立配种合同，相互协作。从现在起，就要让种公畜和母畜吃好一点，并且推广那些行之有效的催情办法，促使发情和提高配种能力，提高受胎率。
    还要大力开展人工授精，提高种公畜的利用率，加速牲畜的繁殖改良工作。除了充分利用现有的人工授精器材以外，可以推广各地已有的成功经验，就地取材，利用土法，解决器材不足的困难。人工授精人员不足的地方，要及时举办训练班，或用带徒弟的办法抓紧培养。人民公社、生产大队和生产队都应该有计划地分批建立自己的牲畜配种组织。国营种畜场、国营农牧场，都应该充分利用自己的现有条件，扩大优良种畜的利用率，帮助附近的人民公社做好牲畜的繁殖改良工作。
    （四）牲畜的发情、配种、保胎、育仔、使役等，都必须有充足的饲料。人民公社都应当根据节约用粮的原则，一方面保证人吃，另方面也要拨给牲畜一定数量的精料。散失在地里和场里的可作饲料的一切农副产物，都应当收贮利用起来，保证当前牲畜饲料的供应。
    此外，许多地方都准备在一九五九年退耕一部分山坡地、低洼地和盐碱地等比较瘠薄的土地，应当利用这些退耕地，种植高产的饲草饲料，建立饲料基地。每一个人民公社都应该以生产大队或生产队为单位，统筹安排本单位全年需要的饲草和饲料。在制定播种计划的时候，就必须把饲草饲料统一安排在内。
    （五）春季的牲畜配种季节时间短促，稍纵即逝。各地都要把牲畜配种任务立即布置到社、到队，采取定人、定畜、定任务、定时间、定质量的办法，及早做好牲畜配种的各项准备工作，并且充分运用一九五八年领导农业生产的经验，采取政治挂帅、广播动员、现场评比等等方式，认真把群众发动起来，立即掀起一个规模空前的牲畜配种高潮。保证一九五九年农业和牧业两丰收。
    要求每一个人民公社、每一个畜牧兽医工作站、每一个国营农牧场，在春季的配种季节结束以后，都就春季配种工作分别向其直接的上级机关做一书面报告，由省汇总于五月底报农业部。农垦部直属的农牧场则报农垦部并抄送农业部。
                                       一九五九年二月十七日
