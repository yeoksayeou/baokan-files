	Conserving Energy and Building Strength for Future Endeavors
	——The Rich and Colorful Spring Festival Life of Workers in the Capital
	By Our Reporter
		The Club Director Is Kept Busy
	Who is the busiest during the Spring Festival holiday in factories?
	At the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant, it was hard to find the young club director. He was answering the phone, and we only heard him say: "Okay! I'll have someone send the Soviet dance costumes to your metalworking workshop later. We'll definitely let you wear them on stage..." Another phone rang, and he hurriedly picked it up and said: "Good, our band can go to your factory to accompany the performance. Let the workers from our two factories have a good get-together." As soon as he put down the headset, the phone rang again, making him busy answering: "The program for the joint performance at the Chaoyang People's Commune on the third day of the new year has been selected, including cross-talk, Huangmei opera, chorus, and dance..."
	Just as we were about to start talking, several people came into the room to find the club director.
	Our conversation kept getting interrupted, always breaking off after a sentence or two. A trade union cadre said: "Don't wait for him! He's the busiest person in our factory right now. People are looking for him day and night. We're afraid he'll get sick from exhaustion, so we advised him to take a break, but he wouldn't agree. Our factory workers completed the plan for early February ahead of schedule before the Spring Festival, and now they've put forward a new slogan saying that they will ensure a flying start after the Spring Festival holiday. As trade union workers, how can we not do everything we can to let them have a great time during the Spring Festival?"
			Drinking Tea and Composing Poems
	In the art hall of the Laboring People's Cultural Palace, there is a "teahouse." Two palace lanterns are hung in the hall, their red light shining everywhere, creating a Spring atmosphere. Many workers sit here and improvise, drinking tea and composing poems. The boards for posting poems are completely covered.
	Zhang Baoqing, a young lathe operator from the Dongfeng Machinery Factory, had just posted a poem that read, "Enjoy the Spring Festival well, the whole family laughs together, when it's time to go to work, don't let it be a second late," and was already writing another one: "Sunflowers always face the sun, the people of the whole country have their hearts set on the Party, the sun shines warmly on people's hearts, the Communist Party's kindness will never be forgotten."
	As the workers wrote and admired, someone suddenly began to read aloud: "In the old days, Kongming borrowed the east wind to defeat Cao Cao's million-strong army. Today, everyone is competing with Zhuge Liang, the east wind will always prevail over the west wind."
	"Excellent! Who wrote this? There's no signature?" Someone replied: "It was a young man in a leather jacket who went to the dance hall to dance."
	Li Haiquan, an old worker from the Beijing Camera Factory, arrived late. He had never written a poem before. Seeing the walls covered with poems written by the workers themselves, he was very excited and picked up a pen to write one: "Entering the teahouse, my heart is happy, poems fill the wall like a hundred flowers blooming, the laboring people have today, thanks to the Chinese Communist Party."
			Spending the New Year with Actors
	At the Beijing Workers' Club, the lights were brightly lit and the atmosphere was festive. Workers who had finished their New Year's dinner came here with their families and children to spend the Spring Festival with famous actors.
	Hearty laughter rang out in the hall. Cross-talk comedians Ma Ji and Guo Quanbao bowed three times to the worker comrades to "congratulate them on the Spring Festival." Peking opera actor Qiu Shengrong said to the workers: "You've all worked hard for a year. Tonight we're having a get-together here, just like at home. We'll sing whatever you comrades want to hear." The actors sang one and then another. Tan Fuying and Qiu Shengrong sang "The Case of Chen Shimei" together, and Qiu Shengrong also sang two excerpts from "Yao Qi." Li Shaochun sang "Hongyangdong," and Ma Lianliang sang "San Niang Teaches Her Son" and then added an excerpt from "Ten Elders Pacify Liu." Some Peking opera actors not only sang Peking opera, but also performed Xihe drum, single-string, and Yue opera. Hou Xirui, a famous Peking opera performer of the Jing role who had been away from the stage for many years, couldn't help but go on stage to sing a song "Beating Yan Song." When the old actor took the stage to sing, Ma Lianliang played the drums for him, Zhang Junqiu played the Qin, and Qiu Shengrong personally held the gong. The workers in the audience welcomed this rare collaborative performance with thunderous applause.
	When the get-together ended, the workers flocked to the lounge to thank the actors. The workers hoped that they would perform more often in the factories and guide amateur cultural activities. Ma Lianliang said on behalf of the actors present: "It's our duty!" He also warmly said to the workers: "You go ahead, we'll follow closely. Let's make a great leap forward together."
				Visiting the People's Commune
	In front of the Party Committee of the Huangtugang People's Commune, children dressed in their best clothes ran, jumped, and cheered: "The worker uncles have come to wish us a Happy New Year!"
	Coming here were more than 40 worker representatives from the Fengtai Bridge Factory. The Fengtai Bridge Factory and the Huangtugang People's Commune are less than ten minutes away from each other. Workers and commune members often meet, and some have become close friends. As soon as the guests arrived, firecrackers crackled non-stop. Amid thunderous applause, representatives from the factory and the commune congratulated each other on the Spring Festival and wished for an even greater leap forward in production after the Spring Festival. Under the warm reception of the commune members, some workers visited the commune's 1958 Great Leap Forward exhibition and the ten-room greenhouse of vegetables and flowers, while others visited commune members' homes. Advanced producers, workers Cao Shengzhi and Li Weirong said to Wu Xiuzhen, a commune member and municipal agricultural model worker, that the workers recognized that this year was a decisive year in the three years of hard struggle, and that they had exceeded the production plan for early February by 8.4% three days before the Spring Festival. Wu Xiuzhen smiled and said, "Good, let's compete in the Great Leap Forward! This year, the commune will greatly develop vegetable production and the raising of pigs, chickens, and other poultry, to support the city with more abundant non-staple foods." Then, more than 600 commune members were invited to visit the factory, and the workers and commune members watched programs written and performed by both sides together.
			A Frequent Guest – The Factory Director
	Han Zhaoliang, the director of the Civil Electrical Appliance Factory, visited the workers' homes one by one. He came to the door of old worker Guo Qing's home very familiarly and heard laughter inside. He quietly opened the door and said with a smile to the host: "Wow! It's really lively. I thought you had guests!"
	"Old Han, come on in! We're eating dumplings on the first day of the New Year. You're not an outsider," Guo Qing said, pulling Han Zhaoliang to sit down.
	Factory Director Han grabbed Guo Qing's daughter: "Xiao Qin, who bought you the hair tie? It's so pretty!"
	"Hurry up and wish your uncle a Happy New Year!" Xiao Qin's mother gestured to Xiao Qin. But the little girl mischievously said, "He comes here often, he's not an outsider, who's going to wish him a Happy New Year!"
	Factory Director Han talked to Guo Qing about Guo Qing's holiday life. Guo Qing immediately introduced his "plan" with relish: watch a movie on the first day of the New Year, receive his apprentices on the second day, watch two more movies on the third day, and go to the park with some friends on the fourth day to take some photos together. The factory director praised his "plan" as rich and colorful, but "not thorough enough: one is that there is no content for the evening of the second day, and the other is that there is a lack of overall planning, and no one is cooking at home, how will the plan be realized?" Guo Qing's wife said with a smile: "We two have divided the work, one of us will cook for two days." The factory director said: "I have two funny movie tickets for 'Two times two equals five.' How about going to the theater on the evening of the second day?"

    养精蓄锐奔前程
    ——首都工人丰富多采的春节生活

        忙坏了俱乐部主任
    在工厂的春节假期中，最忙的是谁呢？
    在北京汽车制造厂，好容易才找到了年青的俱乐部主任。他正在接电话，只听见他说：“好吧！回头就叫人把苏联舞衣给你们金工车间送去，一定让你们穿上它上台表演……”。另一个电话又响了，他急急忙忙拿起来说：“好，我们的乐队可以到你们厂去伴奏，让我们两个厂的工人在一块好好联欢联欢。”刚把耳机放下，电话的铃声又使他忙着去接：“初三去朝阳人民公社联欢演出的节目已经选好了，有相声、黄梅戏、合唱、舞蹈……”
    我们正要接谈的时候，屋里又进来几个人找俱乐部主任。
    我们的谈话老继续不下去，总是谈一两句就叫人打断了。工会一位干部说：你们别等他了吧！他现在是我们全厂最忙的一个人。日日夜夜都有人找他。我们怕他累病了，劝他歇歇，可是他不答应。我们工厂的工人春节前提前完成了2月上旬计划，现在又提出新口号说，要保证春节开工后满堂红。做工会工作的人，怎能不想尽一切办法，让他们在春节期间玩得痛痛快快呢？
            饮茶赋诗
    劳动人民文化宫的艺术厅里有个“茶馆”。馆内悬挂着两个宫灯，红光普照，春意融融。很多工人坐在这里即兴挥笔，饮茶赋诗，张贴诗篇的板壁上被贴得没一点空隙。
    东风机械厂的青年车工张宝清，刚把“春节玩得好，全家齐欢笑，上班时间到，不让它差分秒”的诗贴到板壁上，挥笔又是一首：“向日葵总向阳，全国人民心向党，太阳普照人心暖，共产党的恩情永难忘”。
    工人们一面写，一面欣赏，忽然有人高声朗诵起来了：“昔日孔明借东风，打退曹操百万兵，今日人人赛诸葛，东风永远压西风。”
    “太好了！这是谁写的，怎么没有署名？”有人回答：“是个穿皮加克的小伙子，跑到舞厅跳舞去了。
    北京照像机厂老工人李海泉，来得很晚，他从来没写过诗，看到工人们自己写的诗琳琅满壁，心里很激动，提起笔来也写了一首：“进得茶馆心舒畅，诗篇满墙百花放，劳动人民有今日，感谢中国共产党。”
            和演员共度新春
    北京工人俱乐部里，华灯初上，喜气盈门。吃罢年饭的工人们，带着家属和孩子，来到这里同著名演员们共度新春。
    会场上响起了爽朗的笑声。相声演员马季、郭全宝登台向工人同志们三鞠躬，“恭贺春厘”。京剧演员裘盛戎对工人们说：“大家辛苦一年了，今晚在这里联欢，就像在家里一样。同志们要听什么，咱们就唱什么。”演员们唱一个还不够，再加一个，两个。谭富英和裘盛戎合唱了“铡美案”，裘盛戎又唱了两段“姚期”，李少春唱了“洪羊洞”，马连良唱罢“三娘教子”，又加一段“十老安刘”。有些京剧演员不仅唱京剧，还反串西河大鼓、单弦和越剧。脱离舞台生活多年的六十八岁的著名净角侯喜瑞，也情不自禁地上台高歌了一曲“打严嵩”。当这位老演员登台演唱的时候，马连良为他击鼓，张君秋给他操琴，裘盛戎亲自掌锣。台下的工人们以雷动的掌声欢迎这场不可多得的合作演出。
    联欢结束了，工人们拥到休息室向演员们道谢。工人们希望他们多到工厂演出，辅导业余文艺活动。马连良代表在场的演员们说：“义不容辞！”他还热情地对工人们说：“你们头里走，我们紧跟着，咱们共同大跃进。”
              到人民公社作客
    黄土岗人民公社党委会门前，穿得漂漂亮亮的小孩子们跑着、跳着、欢呼着：“工人叔叔向我们拜年来了！”
    到这里来的是丰台桥梁厂的四十多位工人代表。丰台桥梁厂同黄土岗人民公社相距不到十分钟的路程，工人和社员经常见面，有的已相结成知心朋友。客人们一到，鞭炮声就噼噼啪啪地闹个不停。在春雷般的掌声中，工厂和公社的代表相互祝贺春节好，祝贺春节后生产有更猛的跃进。在社员们的殷勤接待下，有的工人参观了公社1958年跃进展览会和十大间温室的蔬菜和鲜花，有的工人到社员家作客。先进生产者、工人曹胜志、李维荣对公社社员、市农业劳模武秀珍说，工人们都认识到今年是苦战三年中有决定性意义的一年，春节前三天，就超额8.4％完成了2月上旬的生产计划。武秀珍笑着说，好，咱们在大跃进中比赛吧！今年公社要大大发展蔬菜生产与猪、鸡等家禽的饲养，用更充裕的副食品支援城市。接着，六百多个社员又被邀请去工厂作客，工人同社员一起观看了他们双方自编自演的节目。
            常来的客人——厂长
    民用电器厂厂长韩昭良挨个到工人家里串门。他很熟悉地来到老工人郭庆家的家门前，只听见屋里一片说笑声。他悄悄地把门拉开，就笑着对主人说：“嗬！真热闹啊，我以为你家来了客人哩！”
    “老韩，快来！年初一吃饺子，没有外人。”郭庆一边说，一边拉住韩厂长让他坐下来。
    韩厂长一把拉住郭庆的女孩：“小琴，谁给你买的头绳，这么漂亮！”
    “还不给你大伯拜年！”小琴的妈妈向小琴做着手势。可是这位小姑娘却调皮地说：“他常来，又不是外人，谁给他拜年啊！”
    韩厂长和郭庆谈到了郭庆的假期生活。郭庆立刻津津有味地介绍了他的“规划”：初一看电影，初二接待徒弟们来拜年，初三再看两个电影，初四和几个朋友到公园玩去，一起拍个照片。厂长称赞他的这个“规划”丰富多采，但是“还不够周密：一个是初二晚上还没有玩的内容，另一个是缺乏全面安排，家中没有人做饭，计划怎么实现呢？”郭庆的爱人笑着说：“我们两个人分了工，一人做两天饭。”厂长说：“我这里有两张‘二乘二等于五’的逗人笑的电影票，初二晚上还是看戏去吧。”
