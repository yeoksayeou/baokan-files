I will once again transcribe this well-known quote from our great revolutionary teacher Lenin:

	"Communistic subbotniks are the gratuitous, absolutely voluntary and unaided work of individual persons, performed on behalf of the whole of society, work performed not because it is prescribed by some authority or state, but because it is voluntary and cheerful work, performed without expectation of reward from any person or authority, and without the condition that it is to be paid for." (See "Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on Communist Society," page 64)

Now, let's look at a small, touching story. Such things are not uncommon in our country.

	"On January 19th, the Liberation Daily published an open request for voluntary labor during the Spring Festival. The letter stated: 'The Spring Festival is approaching, and both large and small steel mills will be closed for the holiday. If there is a need to repair steel furnaces, I am willing to volunteer my labor. I have a monthly pass, and no matter how far or near, day or night, I am ready to be called upon. I am a boiler model worker and also have skills in electric welding and gas cutting.' The letter was written by Tang Yuqing, a worker at the China Shipbuilding Factory… After sending the letter, he actively prepared. He cancelled his Spring Festival theater tickets and told his children that his wife and sister would accompany them during the holiday, while he prepared his tools and waited for notification at the factory.
	After Tang Yuqing's letter was published, it received widespread response and support. Workers, technicians, and teachers and students from other factories and schools wrote and called him, expressing their desire to learn from him, and some even requested to participate in this meaningful voluntary labor with him. Li Miaogen and Zhu Guanglin, veteran workers in the same workshop as Tang Yuqing, considering that his skills were not yet proficient, proactively told him: 'If you can't handle it, come find us, and bring back complex drawings to study together.'" (People's Daily, February 6: "Battle Drums Welcome the Spring")

Seizing the holiday to volunteer labor for any factory, and being "ready to be called upon no matter how far or near, day or night"—what kind of work attitude is this! Using Lenin's words to examine the actions of this ordinary worker, every word is well-deserved for him. I don't know if this worker comrade has read Lenin's passage, but he must have already felt that now, no matter which factory it is, it belongs to our socialist country—he is the master of this country. We are building socialism, but from our working class, aren't communist buds sprouting everywhere, welcoming the spring, and about to bloom?

    共产主义的蓓蕾
    姚人为
    我再一次抄下这一段大家熟知的名言，这是我们伟大革命导师列宁说的：
      “共产主义劳动，从比较狭窄和比较严格的意义上说，是一种为社会造福的无报酬的劳动，这种劳动不是为了履行一定的义务、不是为了享有取得某种产品的权利、不是按照事先规定的法定定额进行的劳动，而是自愿的劳动，是无定额的劳动，是不指望报酬、没有报酬条件的劳动，是根据为公共利益劳动的习惯、根据必须为公共利益劳动的自觉要求（这已成为习惯）来进行的劳动，这种劳动是健康的身体的自然需要。”（见“马恩列斯论共产主义社会”64页）
    再请大家看一个小小的动人的故事。这样的事在我们国家里并不稀奇了。
    “1月19日，解放日报上出现了一封公开征求春节义务劳动的短信，信上说：‘春节快到了，大小炼钢厂都要休假，欢度春节，如有需要修理炼钢炉等，我愿意去义务劳动。我有月季票，不论路远路近，白天黑夜，随叫随到。我是锅炉出样工，也会电焊、气割等技术。’写信的是中华造船厂工人唐余庆。……发信以后，他就积极进行准备。春节的戏票不订了，还和孩子们讲好，节日让他爱人和妹妹陪他们玩，自己准备好工具在厂里等候通知。
    唐余庆的信发表以后，受到人们普遍响应和支持。别的工厂的工人、技术人员和学校的师生纷纷写信和打电话给他，表示向他学习，有的还要求同他一起参加这个有意义的义务劳动。和唐余庆同车间的老师傅李妙根和祝广林考虑到他的技术还不够熟练，主动关照他说：‘你搞不下来时就找我们，复杂图纸就带回来一起研究。’”（人民日报2月6日：“战鼓迎春”）
    抓住假期愿意为任何厂子作义务劳动，而且是“不论路远路近，白天黑夜，随叫随到”。这是怎样的一种劳动态度啊！用列宁的话来检验一下这个普通工人的行动，每一个字对他来说都是当之无愧的。我不知道这位工人同志是否读过列宁这段话，但是他一定已经感觉到，现在不论是哪一个厂子，都是属于我们社会主义国家的——他是这个国家的主人。我们正在建设社会主义，但是从我们工人阶级的身上，不是到处都在孕育着共产主义的蓓蕾，正迎着春天，含苞欲放的吗？
