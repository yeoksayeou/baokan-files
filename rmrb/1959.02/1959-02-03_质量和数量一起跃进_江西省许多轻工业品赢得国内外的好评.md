Nanchang, February 2 (Reported by this newspaper) Jiangxi Province, while vigorously developing light industry, has paid attention to mobilizing the masses to improve product quality. Not only has the number of light industrial factories in the province increased to over 90,000, but the quality of products has also been generally improved.

Last year, some textile, food, ceramic, chemical, and other products produced in Jiangxi Province won unanimous praise from consumers. The bleached fine cloth produced by the Jiangxi Cotton Textile Factory is soft, durable, and sells well throughout the province. The Hero brand bamboo shell thermos bottles manufactured by the Jiangxi Glass Factory can still maintain a temperature of 78 degrees Celsius after 24 hours. In the ceramic industry, in addition to the continued maintenance of world-class levels for products like Qinghua and Linglong porcelain, the quality of porcelain industrial products such as 10 kV high-voltage resistors and oil switch bushings has also rapidly improved, with continuous orders from both domestic and foreign customers. The sugar, oil, wine, and other products produced by the agricultural product processing plants of people's communes in various regions are mostly nutritious, hygienic, and excellent in color, aroma, and taste. The Yangmei wine newly brewed by the Damaoshan Reclamation Farm has been sold at home and abroad. In 1957, Jiangxi exported 45 varieties of goods, and in 1958, this number increased to 71.

In the process of improving the quality of light industrial products, Jiangxi criticized the ideas that it was difficult to improve quality due to poor factory equipment and technology. Then, based on market needs and raw material conditions, a technical innovation movement was launched. First, all industries closely monitored market feedback on products and improved product quality accordingly. For example, with enamel products, initially, the masses felt that the patterns were old-fashioned, the gloss was insufficient, and the styling was not diverse enough; enamel manufacturing workers concentrated their efforts on improving the styling design and gloss. The Nanchang Taifeng Enamel Factory mobilized its employees to produce glossy enamel powder, increasing the enamel gloss from 66 degrees to over 100 degrees. This product was welcomed both inside and outside the province and was also sold to the South Sea Islands and other places. Second, based on the characteristics of local raw materials, new, high-quality products were manufactured in accordance with local conditions; when using substitutes, earnest attention was paid to solving the problem of poor raw materials affecting quality. For example, the Jiangxi Cotton Textile Factory, based on the characteristics of Jiangxi's cotton, which has long and high-quality fibers, produced bleached fine cloth that was even better than the Longtou bleached fine cloth, fully utilizing the advantages of the raw materials. Third, tools were innovated, equipment was improved, and operations were gradually developed from manual to mechanized and semi-mechanized. For example, in many people's communes' sugar factories, the stoves for boiling sugar in the past did not have chimneys, and charcoal ash often fell into the sugar pots, resulting in excessive impurities in the sugar; later, the workers came up with a solution to change the single stove into a row of multi-pot stoves, uniformly installing a large chimney, ensuring the cleanliness of the sugar. In the ceramic industry's painting process, printing and decal application were vigorously promoted, resulting in faster speed and guaranteed quality.

    质量和数量一起跃进
    江西省许多轻工业品赢得国内外的好评
    本报南昌2日电　江西省在大量发展轻工业中注意发动群众提高产品质量，全省轻工业工厂不仅在数量上发展到九万多个，而且在产品质量上获得普遍提高。
    江西省去年生产的一些纺织、食品、陶瓷、化工等产品，质量博得消费者一致的好评。江西棉纺织厂生产的加密白细布，柔软耐用，畅销全省。江西玻璃厂制造的英雄牌竹壳热水瓶，经过二十四小时仍然能保持摄氏七十八度的温度。在陶瓷工业方面，除清花、玲珍等产品继续保持世界先进水平外，十千伏特高压电阻和油开关套等瓷质工业用品的质量也迅速提高，全省和国内外不断有人订货。各地人民公社的农产品加工厂生产的糖、油、酒等产品，大部分做到了营养、卫生、色香味俱佳。大茅山垦殖场新酿造的杨梅酒，已销行国内外。1957年，江西出口品种有四十五种，1958年增加到七十一种。
    江西在提高轻工业产品质量的过程中，批判了认为工厂设备不好、技术差，难以提高质量等思想，然后根据市场需要、原料情况等开展了技术革新运动。首先，各个行业密切注意了市场对产品的反映，并且根据反映改进产品质量。例如搪瓷制品，起初群众认为花色老一套，光泽不够，造型种类不够多样；搪瓷制造业职工便集中力量改进造型设计和光泽程度。南昌泰丰搪瓷厂发动职工制成光泽珐琅粉，使搪瓷光泽度由六十六度提高到一百度以上。这种产品受到省内外欢迎，而且远销到南洋群岛等地。其次，根据当地原材料的特点，因地制宜，制造新的、质量高的产品；在利用代用品时，切实注意解决原料不好而影响质量的问题。例如，江西棉纺织厂根据江西的棉花纤维长、质量好的特点，制成了比龙头白细布还要好的加密白细布，充分利用了原料的特长。第三，革新工具，改进设备，逐步由手工操作发展到机械化和半机械化。例如，许多人民公社的制糖厂，过去熬糖的炉灶没有烟囱，柴炭灰往往掉入糖锅，使糖含杂质过多；后来职工们想办法，把单一的炉灶改成一列式多锅炉灶，统一安装一个大烟囱，保证了糖的清洁。陶瓷工业的彩绘工序，大力推广了印花、贴花，速度快，质量也有了保证。
