Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 12th: Ahmed, a secretary of the Central Committee Secretariat of the Communist Party of India, stated on the 11th while speaking in the Indian Council of States that the Communist Party of India is willing to offer cooperation in the common efforts of the nation to defend democracy and develop the national economy and culture.

Ahmed was speaking on behalf of the Communist Party of India during the Council of States' discussion of Indian President Prasad's opening address. He said that if such cooperation "is sought in an appropriate manner and is based on a genuine people's program, the Communist Party of India will be the first to offer such cooperation." Ahmed called for the full use of all resources to develop planning work and to take a firm stance against attempts by vested interest groups to cancel planning work.

Earlier, Indira Gandhi, the newly appointed president of the Congress Party, said at a press conference after taking office that she would bring those who had once been with the Congress Party (referring to the Praja Socialist Party) back into the fold. She expressed her expectation of cooperation from the Communist Party in building the country, although "the views and methods of the Communists differ from those of the Congress Party." At the same time, she said, "I will make special efforts to win Kerala back for the Congress Party." The "Hindustan Times" reported on the 12th that a new political party might be formed in the near future, which would oppose the stipulation of maximum land ownership limits, oppose the establishment of agricultural cooperatives and state-run food operations, and oppose "infringements on the private sector" of the economy. The newspaper pointed out that Ranga, secretary of the Congress Party parliamentary group, and Singh, a minister from Uttar Pradesh, had recently expressed this view. According to some newspapers, Congress Party members in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab have differences of opinion on the issue of land reform. In the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly, about forty Congress Party members have withdrawn from the party and decided to form a separate organization.

Joshi, Secretary of the Central Secretariat of the Communist Party of India, published a commentary in the latest issue of the party's organ "New Age" weekly, calling for the establishment of true national unity in India. He wrote that India's struggle "will continue to advance victoriously under the banner of national unity with the active participation of communists. India cannot advance under the banner of anti-communism."

    艾哈迈德在印度国会联邦院表示
    印度共产党愿提供合作
    保卫民主发展国民经济
    新华社新德里12日电　印度共产党中央委员会书记处书记艾哈迈德11日在印度国会联邦院讲话的时候，表示印度共产党愿意在全国的共同努力中提供合作，来保卫民主以及发展国民经济和文化。
    艾哈迈德是在联邦院讨论印度总统普拉沙德的开会词时代表印度共产党发言的。他说，如果这种合作“是以适当的方式来谋求，并且是以真正的人民纲领为基础的话，印度共产党将首先提供这种合作。”艾哈迈德要求充分使用一切资源，使计划工作得到发展，并且采取坚决的态度来反对既得利益集团取消计划工作的企图。
    早些时候，新担任国大党主席的英迪拉·甘地夫人在就职以后，曾经在记者招待会上说，她将使曾经一度和国大党在一起的人（她指的是人民社会党）回到国大党的怀抱中来。她表示，她指望得到共产党的合作来建设国家，虽然“共产党人的观点和方法不同于国大党”。同时，她说，“我将进行特别的努力，为国大党把喀拉拉邦争取回来。”“印度斯坦时报”在12日报道，可能在不久的将来成立一个新政党，它将反对规定拥有土地的最高限额，反对建立农业合作社和实行粮食国营，并且反对“侵犯私营部分”的经济。这家报纸指出，国大党议会党团秘书兰加和北方邦部长辛格最近表示了这种看法。据一些报纸报道，北方邦和旁遮普邦的国大党人士在土地改革问题上意见有分歧。在安得拉邦的立法会议中，已经有大约四十名国大党议员退党，决定成立一个单独的组织。
    印度共产党中央书记处书记乔希在党的机关刊物“新世纪”周报最近一期上发表评论，要求印度建立真正的民族团结。他写道，印度的斗争“必将在有共产党人积极参加的民族团结的旗帜下继续朝着胜利前进。印度是不可能在反共的旗帜下前进的。”
