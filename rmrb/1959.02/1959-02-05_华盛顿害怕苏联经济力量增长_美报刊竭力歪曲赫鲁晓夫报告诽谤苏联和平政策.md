Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 2nd: According to TASS, New York, February 2nd: If one looks at the comments of major American newspapers on Khrushchev's report to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, it would create the impression that Khrushchev was not talking about the grand plan for the development of the Soviet national economy, nor about the establishment of the material and technical foundation of Soviet communism, but mainly about the mass production of intercontinental ballistic missiles in the Soviet Union.

It is not difficult to see the intention of the "free" American newspapers in distorting this report: these newspapers, at the request of certain people, are attempting to slander the Soviet Union's peaceful policies and arouse suspicion about the Soviet Union's call for peaceful competition between the socialist and capitalist systems.

The "New York Herald Tribune," based on this "interpretation" of the report, is once again launching a frenzied propaganda campaign to increase American military appropriations, at the request of the aforementioned people.

The purpose of the American propaganda machine's clamor about Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles is to divert the attention of the American public and prevent them from paying attention to the real reason that alarms the American ruling class, which is the Soviet Union's seven-year plan for economic development.

This feeling of anxiety is also reflected in the disputes that American experts are now conducting around the economic development prospects of the United States and the Soviet Union. The characteristic of these disputes is that no one dares to say, as in the past, that the Soviet Union's new plan for the development of the national economy is "utopian" or "propaganda." The "New York Times" wrote on the day the Congress opened that "in the era of Soviet space rockets," Americans can no longer "easily evade the Soviet plan" as if it were something utopian.

The "New York Herald Tribune's" Washington economic commentator pointed out in an article that the most authoritative American experts are convinced that "this program of the Soviet Union will increase the production power of an already formidable industrial power." According to this commentator, these experts still expect that the Soviet Union will not catch up with the United States by 1970.

The "New York Times'" Washington commentator wrote in an article: "The slow economic development of the United States indicates that the Soviet Union can win this competition and catch up with the United States in 1970."

### 华盛顿害怕苏联经济力量增长  美报刊竭力歪曲赫鲁晓夫报告诽谤苏联和平政策

    华盛顿害怕苏联经济力量增长
    美报刊竭力歪曲赫鲁晓夫报告诽谤苏联和平政策
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社纽约2日讯：如果看一下美国主要报纸对赫鲁晓夫在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会上所作报告的评论，那就会造成这样一种印象：好像赫鲁晓夫谈的并不是关于苏联发展国民经济的宏伟计划，也不是关于苏联共产主义物质技术基础的建立，而主要是关于在苏联成批生产洲际弹道导弹。
    不难看出“自由的”美国报刊歪曲这个报告的意图何在：这些报刊在按照某些人士的要求，企图诽谤苏联的和平政策，引起人们对苏联关于社会主义体系和资本主义体系之间开展和平竞赛的号召的怀疑。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”根据对报告的这种“解释”，按照上述那些人士的要求，再次为增加美国的军事拨款而掀起疯狂的宣传。
    美国宣传机构掀起关于苏联洲际弹道导弹的叫嚣，其目的是转移美国公众的注意，使他们不去注意引起美国统治集团惊慌失措的真正原因，那就是苏联经济发展的七年计划。
    在美国各种专家现在围绕着美国和苏联的经济发展前景所进行的争吵中，也表现了这种惶惑的心情。这些争吵的特点是：这次没有谁敢像过去那样，说苏联发展国民经济的新计划是“空想”或“宣传”。“纽约时报”在代表大会开幕的当天写道，“在苏联宇宙火箭的时代里”，美国人已经无法像对待某种空想的东西那样来“轻易地回避苏联的计划”。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”驻华盛顿经济评论员在一篇文章指出，最权威的美国专家们确信，“苏联的这一纲领将增加已经是可怕的工业强国的生产威力”。据这个评论员说，这些专家们仍然指望到1970年时苏联不会赶上美国。
    “纽约时报”驻华盛顿评论员在文章中写道：“美国缓慢的经济发展表明苏联可以赢得这场竞赛，并且在1970年赶上美国。”
