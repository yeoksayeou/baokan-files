    Opening a New Era for the World
    Song Qingling
    The tremendous progress made by the Soviet Union and China in science, engineering, and all forms of production, the even greater plans we have formulated for further progress, the joyful atmosphere of life and work that permeates our land, and the transformation of our people into a new type of person with a communist spirit (highly cultured, engaging in both mental and manual labor, selflessly, fearlessly, and steadfastly loving peace and just laborers) – all these critically important facts are now attracting the attention of the entire world.
    The friendship between the Soviet Union and China is one of the powerful driving forces behind this unparalleled material and spiritual "Great Leap Forward." This friendship is firmly established on the foundation of Marxist-Leninist truth, reaffirming and expanding the concept of "friendship between nations," setting a new standard for it.
    The Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance we concluded in February 1950 expressed and further strengthened the blood ties between the Soviet and Chinese peoples. It was concluded to consolidate the already existing warm feelings between the two peoples and to enhance our fraternal cooperation in all matters. The important communiqués issued after the meetings between N.S. Khrushchev and Mao Zedong in Beijing in October 1954 and August 1958, as well as the epoch-making Moscow Declaration and Peace Manifesto of 1957, further strengthened our enduring and unbreakable comradely friendship and cooperation in all aspects. This comradely friendship is a vast and vital force, powerfully promoting the cause of peace and progress for all mankind.
    In our country, the people are the masters because the ownership of the means of production is in their hands. This determines the form of state organization we have established for ourselves and the policies our government pursues at home and abroad. The purpose of a socialist state is to enable its people to continuously improve their living standards as they strive to achieve communist goals; when communism is realized, everyone will work according to their ability and receive what is necessary for a prosperous and cultured life. In our country, everyone lives by their own labor, and no one is allowed to live off the labor of others.
    Just as there can be no exploitation in a socialist country, a socialist country cannot exploit other countries. The national and racial prejudices manufactured by bourgeois chauvinism to undermine the natural amity that exists among all peoples are absolutely incompatible with socialist ideology. Socialism requires us to see our human fellows with new eyes and opens the way for the first time to establish a truly unhindered friendship between nations and among peoples. Only on this basis can mutual respect arise, and from here can spring the practical possibility and prospect of a world without war and with universal cooperation for progress. In simple and clear terms, this is the Marxist-Leninist internationalism of the working class.
    The Soviet Union and China are firm representatives of these irresistible ideals. Our great alliance is based on these ideals. Our two countries are completely equal. We respect each other's territorial and sovereign integrity and do not interfere in each other's internal affairs. We practice selfless and fraternal assistance, which is part of our socialist relations.
    In our long history, we Chinese people have never known any feeling comparable to the comradely affection we have for the Soviet people and that they wholeheartedly express to us. The Soviet people have an inspiring history of heroic struggle and rich experience in building socialism. They have unreservedly shared their unwavering fighting spirit and broad knowledge with us. During our "Great Leap Forward," China has been able to make progress in construction and improving the lives of 650 million people that some have found unbelievable. This is inseparable from the enormous material assistance provided to us by the Soviet Union. Recently, China and the Soviet Union signed an agreement in Moscow on further expanding economic cooperation. In this agreement, the Soviet Union again provided new and significant assistance to China's socialist construction. The signing of this agreement once again embodies the Soviet people's fraternal affection for the Chinese people.
    This highest form of international relations is a hallmark of the harmonious cooperation among socialist countries. Led by the Soviet Union, they are closely united, advancing shoulder to shoulder, supporting and encouraging each other, and achieving remarkable successes in all aspects of their work. The Soviet Union has set the goal of surpassing the United States in output, and China has set the goal of surpassing the United Kingdom.
    In our relations with the people of other countries, regardless of where they live or what system they choose, we implement the principle of treating all peoples with the deepest respect and friendship. Those who still suffer oppression or any form of discrimination will always receive our special sympathy and heartfelt support. Our past actions demonstrate that we support their struggle for independence and their struggle for the rapid establishment of their independent economies.
    Friendship of this nature is new to humanity, beginning with the appearance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries on the world stage. To fully appreciate the significance of this friendship, one must analyze the completely different premises that form the basis of relations between nations wherever capitalism and imperialism exist.
    Under the capitalist system, state power is also in the hands of those who own the means of production – in this system, the owners are not the entire people but the private landowners and capitalists who possess the means of production. In determining and implementing policies, the interests and needs of these few are placed above the interests and needs of the majority of society, especially the working people. In most cases, what benefits the ruling class does not benefit the entire people, and the state, which manages the people, is a tool they use to accumulate maximum profits for themselves in the shortest amount of time. This applies to both domestic and foreign policy.
    The relationships between such states can be compared to the relationships among a pack of snarling wolves. They are all beasts of the same kind, but each attempts to defeat its opponents in a struggle to the death. "Friendship" is a synonym for a momentary truce, during which the battle continues in a less violent form, with each side scheming to gain dominance. International relations involve the use of varying degrees of force, with the aim of weakening opponents and creating or exacerbating inequalities between countries and among nations.
    Imperialism is the highest stage of capitalism and its most predatory stage. Therefore, imperialist countries are inherently the most aggressive. They treat every other country as either an object of plunder or an irreconcilable opponent. To achieve its aggressive goals with impunity, it can resort to any means, no matter how despicable. Therefore, as long as imperialism exists, the people of all countries face the possibility of turmoil and wars of aggression, and this is the sole source of this disaster in the world today.
    However, in today's world, there is something new: it includes two diametrically opposed concepts of life and interaction. They coexist, but one is becoming increasingly influential, while the other is becoming less so. This follows the laws of historical development, which dictate that old things gradually lose their usefulness and must give way to new things. Sooner or later, people will understand the value of the new overcoming the old; this will accelerate the process of change.
    The same is true in international relations.
    The populations of Asia, Africa, and Latin America account for more than half of the world's population. It is here that people live in suffering under colonial oppression. But it is also here that imperialism is heading towards its demise, as one nation after another gains independence. The antagonistic contradiction between imperialism and national liberation movements can only be resolved by the death of imperialism. However, there are no, and cannot be, antagonistic contradictions between the struggling peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the socialist countries. In any case, as facts have proven, socialist countries care about them and provide active support.
    Can anyone believe that oppressed peoples and formerly oppressed peoples would be deceived by the sweet words of "friendship" from Dulles or Lloyd, the direct representatives of the biggest monopoly capitalists? Can anyone fail to see the massive evidence that socialist countries – countries the people know for certain are reliable friends who will support them in any crisis – have high prestige in these regions?
    The peoples of all countries are tired of the old systems, which cannot provide what people need most in life – fraternity, peace, and progress. This is both a reflection of and a reason for the epoch-making changes taking place all over the world. These changes are: the socialist ranks are growing stronger while the capitalist ranks are shrinking; more and more countries are gaining freedom, while colonial empires are gradually disintegrating; the forces of peace are growing stronger, while the warmongers are becoming increasingly isolated. This is exactly what Chairman Mao Zedong meant when he said, "The East wind prevails over the West wind."
    In this context, we can see that Sino-Soviet friendship occupies a unique position. This friendship realizes humanity's long-held dreams, representing the new world that is taking shape. The remarkable characteristics of this friendship are the consensus of views on fundamental and specific issues, the extremely important and close cooperation in the construction of socialism and communism, and the strong joint defense against possible aggressors. Sino-Soviet friendship is the cornerstone of the unity among the countries of the socialist camp and therefore plays a crucial role in maintaining peace and guaranteeing the rights of people around the world.
    Predictably, those who wish to maintain the old order find it difficult to accept these realities of life. Some people (including our good friends) are a little shocked when they hear us talk about imperialism in this way, especially American imperialism. They think we are somewhat naive, that we underestimate the destructive power of the American war machine.
    To these friends, we say: we have fought for freedom for so long and so arduously that we will not easily underestimate the enemy. It is precisely you who must face the lessons of history and break your outdated superstitions about him. Recall the early days of the Soviet and Chinese revolutions. At that time, the imperialists ruled the world. Their industrial capacity gave them overwhelming superiority in weapons, which they used to brutally suppress us. Our two peoples were practically fighting with pitchforks!
    However, the great Soviet and Chinese peoples triumphed in their revolutions, changing humanity's path to the future. How did they do it? They had no magic formulas, no "secret weapons." They only had the courage and will of heroic warriors who adhered to the irrefutable Marxist-Leninist truth. This is the driving force that mobilized millions of people, turning them into an impregnable fortress. This "miracle" has occurred repeatedly over the past four decades.
    As Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out, the imperialists lack this moral strength because they are only concerned with benefiting themselves at the expense of others, and they are always doing bad things to the people. A person or government that is morally bad may appear strong on the outside, but inside it is rotten and weak – merely a "paper tiger."
    Today, the revolutions in the Soviet Union and China have both been consolidated. The Soviet Union has entered a period of comprehensively building a communist society. The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, recently held, was a congress for advancing toward communism. The plan for the development of the Soviet national economy for 1959-1965, formulated at the congress, is a great plan for building communism. This congress presented all of humanity with a magnificent vision of communism. China is also engaged in socialist construction at a flying speed. Our people are advancing from victory to victory, and a new picture of the "Great Leap Forward" is unfolding before us. Our two countries are becoming stronger and stronger, developing at a speed that can almost be measured in hours. We stand side by side like two giants in the world, at the center of the socialist camp of 900 million people united by Marxist-Leninist friendship. This situation fills the people of the world with heartfelt joy. People are unanimously cheering for this because it is an enduring force, a beacon that illuminates and inspires those who are still oppressed to rise up and fight, no matter how difficult the circumstances. Because without a doubt, it has been proven that the "paper tiger" can be punctured.
    The Soviet Union and China love peace. In our Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, we guarantee that both countries will "...participate in all international activities aimed at ensuring world peace and security in a spirit of faithful cooperation, and fully contribute their strength to the rapid realization of this goal."
    Over the years, we have done everything we can to fulfill this peace guarantee. However, we do not see the same willingness from the West. To this day, there are still some fools in high positions who stubbornly bring humanity to the "brink of war" again and again, talking about "rolling back" our people's countries. And they have accomplices in the Far East who delusionally believe that they can restore their capacity for war in order to participate in these "plans."
    For example, the Kishi Nobusuke government in Tokyo is secretly engaged in modifying the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The Kishi Nobusuke government dreams of restoring Japanese imperialism, making it a threat to the whole of Asia. In fact, it is tying Japan and the Japanese people (who do not want this) to the American war machine, implementing Washington's plan of "using Asians to fight Asians" to create fratricide. The Chinese people will never allow Japanese aggression to rise again; this aggression once caused enormous sacrifices to the Chinese people and the people of other parts of Asia. People remember that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance declares that the two countries are "determined to jointly prevent the revival of Japanese imperialism and the renewed aggression by Japan or other countries that collude with Japan in any form of aggression by strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics."
    These "brinkmen" and their accomplices are heading towards the grave of despicable warmongers. If they push their despicable plans too far, this will surely be their fate.
    In recent months, the American imperialists, who have long forcibly occupied China's territory of Taiwan and other coastal islands, have more blatantly interfered in our country's internal affairs. They are trying to intimidate us by flaunting ships, planes, and missiles in an attempt to prevent China from liberating its sacred territory. Liberating Taiwan is an unfinished task in China's domestic war and can only be resolved by the Chinese people themselves. But the United States has been illegally interfering in this purely internal affair of our country. It absurdly accuses us of "aggression" against ourselves, attempting to create "two Chinas" in order to permanently seize this territory of China, using it as an "unsinkable aircraft carrier" (as American spokesmen have called it) to attack us and other Asian countries.
    Obviously, the Chinese people will never tolerate such unreasonable behavior and infringement. At the appropriate time, we will recover Taiwan and all our other islands. The United States tried to threaten us, but as soon as it spoke, our great friend, the Soviet Union, made its position clear. N.S. Khrushchev clearly announced that any attack on the People's Republic of China would be regarded as an attack on the Soviet government and people. This was like pouring a bucket of cold water over the heads of those hotheads.
    The Soviet Union and China cannot be intimidated. We are not influenced by "positions of strength." We are realists, and we know where the real strength lies – in the people, in the future. Imperialism, especially American imperialism, represents something old and decadent. It has completely exposed its true colors, making people realize that it is the enemy of people everywhere, including the people of imperialist countries. The world socialist system centered on the Soviet Union, the national independence movements supported by socialist countries, and countless progressive, peace-loving people in the rest of the world – they represent the forces of the new. They will surely defeat the forces of the old, no matter how they struggle in their death throes.
    The brilliant record and magnificent achievements of Sino-Soviet friendship demonstrate its great historical significance as a political, economic, and social force. This friendship, born of the lofty desire for human happiness and prosperity, has become an unshakable fortress, uniting more and more people around the world. This friendship is something the Chinese people have reason to be proud of. It points the way towards a bright and infinitely promising future in relations between people and between nations where there will never again be exploitation and oppression, towards a great era of peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism.

    开辟世界的新纪元
    宋庆龄
    苏联和中国在科学、工程和一切形式的生产方面获得的长足进展以及我们为进一步的进展拟订的更伟大的计划，在我们国土上到处洋溢着的生活和工作中的愉快气氛，以及正在把我们的人民改造成为具有共产主义精神的新型的人（有高度文化修养的、手脑并用的、忘我地、无畏地、坚定不移地热爱和平和正义的劳动者），所有这些十分重要的事实，现在正在吸引着全世界的注意。
    苏联和中国的友谊是推动这种无与伦比的物质上和精神上的“跃进”的强大动力之一。这种友谊是牢牢地建立在马克思列宁主义真理的基础之上的，它重新确定和扩展了“各国之间的友谊”的观念，为这种观念树立了一个新的标准。
    我们在1950年2月缔结的友好同盟互助条约，表达了并且进一步加强了苏联和中国人民之间的血肉相连的关系，缔结这项条约是为了巩固两国人民之间已经存在的热烈感情和增进我们在一切问题上的兄弟般的合作。尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫和毛泽东在北京举行会谈以后，在1954年10月和1958年8月先后发表的重要公报，以及1957年发表的具有划时代意义的莫斯科宣言和和平宣言，进一步加强了我们的持久的牢不可破的同志之谊和在一切方面的合作。这种同志之谊是一支巨大的富有生命力的力量，它有力地推动着全人类的和平和进步的事业。
    在我们国家里，人民是主人，因为生产资料的所有权掌握在他们的手里。这就决定了我们为我们自己建立的国家组织的形式和我们的政府在国内外奉行的政策。社会主义国家的目的是使它的人民在为实现共产主义目标而努力的时候能够不断提高生活水平；在共产主义实现的时候，人人都各尽所能地进行劳动，得到富裕的、有文化的生活所必需的东西。在我们的国家里，人人都靠自己的劳动生活，人人都不许靠别人的劳动生活。
    正如同在一个社会主义国家里不能有剥削一样，一个社会主义国家也不能剥削别的国家。资产阶级沙文主义为了破坏各国人民之间存在的自然友爱而制造的民族和种族偏见，是同社会主义思想绝对不相容的。社会主义要我们用新的眼光来看待我们的人类同胞，并且开辟了各国之间和各国人民之间第一次建立起真正的、没有隔阂的友谊的道路。只有在这种基础上，才能够产生相互尊重，从这里才能产生一个没有战争，并且普遍协作争取进步的世界的实际可能性和前景。用简单明了的措词来说，这就是工人阶级的马克思列宁主义的国际主义。
    苏联和中国是这些不可抗拒的理想的坚定代表者。我们的伟大的结盟关系就是以这些理想为基础的。我们两国之间完全平等。我们尊重各自的领土和主权完整，不干涉彼此的内政。我们之间实行着无私的和兄弟般的援助，这是我们的社会主义关系的一部分。
    在我们悠久的历史上，我们中国人民从来不知道有任何感情可以同我们对苏联人民怀有的、而他们衷心向我们表示的同志感情相比拟。苏联人民有着英勇斗争的鼓舞人心的历史和建设社会主义的丰富经验。他们把毫不退缩的战斗精神和广泛的知识都毫无保留地介绍给我们。我们中国在“大跃进”中，已经能够在建设和提高六亿五千万人民的生活方面取得某些人所不能相信的进展。这是同苏联给予我们的巨大物质援助分不开的。最近中苏两国在莫斯科签订了关于进一步扩大经济合作的协定。在这个协定中，苏联又对我国的社会主义建设提供新的重大的援助。这个协定的签订，再一次体现了苏联人民对我国人民的兄弟般的深情厚谊。
    这种最高形式的国际关系是各社会主义国家之间和衷共济的标志。它们以苏联为首、亲密团结、并肩前进，互相支援、互相鼓励，在工作的各个方面都获得了显著的成就。苏联已经规定了在产量方面超过美国的目标，中国规定了超过英国的目标。
    在我们同其他国家人民的关系方面，不管他们住在那里，也不管他们选择什么样的制度，我们实施以最深刻的尊敬和友谊对待一切国家人民的原则。那些仍然遭受压迫或者任何形式的歧视的人们，将永远得到我们的特别同情和衷心支持。我们过去的行动表明，我们是支持他们争取独立的斗争、支持他们为迅速建立他们的独立经济而进行的斗争的。
    这种性质的友谊，对于人类说来是新的，这种友谊是从苏联和其他社会主义国家在世界舞台上出现的时候开始的。要充分体会这种友谊的意义，就必须分析凡是存在着资本主义和帝国主义的地方，形成国家之间的联系的完全不同的前提。
    在资本主义制度下，国家权力也是掌握在占有生产资料的人们的手中的——在这种制度下，所有者并不是全体人民，而是私人占有生产资料的大地主和资本家。在决定和执行政策的时候，是把这些少数人的利益和需要放在社会上大多数人、特别是劳动人民的利益和需要之上的。在大多数情况下，给统治阶级带来好处的，就不会给全体人民带来好处，而管理人民的国家是他们用来在最短时间内为他们积累最大利润的工具。这一点对于对内政策和外交政策都是适用的。
    可以把这类国家之间的关系比作咆哮的狼群之间的关系。它们都是同类的野兽，可是每一个都企图在生死斗争中打败对手。“友谊”是片刻停战的代名词，在这个期间，战斗以不那么猛烈的形式继续着，各方都用尽心机想占据统治地位。国际关系就是使用程度不同的强力，目的是要削弱对手，并且制造或扩大各国之间和各民族之间的不平等。
    帝国主义是资本主义的最高阶段，也是最富有掠夺性的阶段。因此，帝国主义国家本质上就是最富有侵略性的。它把每一个其他国家不是当作掠夺对象，就是当作不可调和的对手。为了达到它的侵略目的而不受惩罚，它可以不择手段，不管那种手段是多么卑鄙。因此，只要帝国主义存在，各国人民就面临着发生动乱和侵略战争的可能性，而这就是今天世界上的这种灾难的唯一根源。
    不过，在今天的世界上，存在着某种新的情况：它包括生活和交往的两种截然相反的概念。它们一起存在着，但是其中的一个影响越来越大，而另一个影响越来越小。这是遵循着历史发展的规律的，这种规律决定旧事物逐渐失去作用而必须让位给新事物。人民迟早会懂得新事物战胜旧事物的价值的；这样就会加速变化的过程。
    在国际关系方面情况也是这样的。
    亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的人口，占地球人口的一半以上。正是在这里，人民在殖民压迫下面痛苦地生活。但是，也正是在这里，随着各国人民一个接一个地取得独立，帝国主义正在走向它的末日。帝国主义和民族主义运动之间的对抗性矛盾，只能以帝国主义的死亡来解决。但是，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的正在斗争的人民跟社会主义国家之间是没有、而且也不可能有对抗性矛盾的。在任何情况下，正如事实所证明的，社会主义国家关怀他们而且给予积极的支持。
    难道有任何人可能相信，被压迫的人民和以前的被压迫人民会因为最大垄断资本家的直接代表杜勒斯或者劳埃德之流说了一些“友谊”的甜言蜜语就受骗吗？难道有任何人可能会看不到大量的证据证明社会主义国家——各国人民肯定地知道这些国家是在任何危机中都会支持他们的可靠朋友——在这些地区有很高威信吗？
    各国人民已经厌倦旧制度了，这些旧制度不能提供人在生活中所最需要的东西——兄弟之谊、和平和进步。这是全世界各地正在发生的划时代的变化的反映，同时也是原因。这些变化就是：社会主义队伍日益壮大而资本主义的队伍日益缩小；越来越多的国家取得自由，而殖民帝国逐渐瓦解；和平的力量日益强大，而战争贩子越来越孤立。这正是毛泽东主席所说的“东风压倒西风”的涵义。
    在这种情况下，我们可以看到中苏友谊占据着一个独特的地位。这种友谊实现了人类长时期以来的梦想，它代表着正在形成中的新世界。这种友谊的显著特点，是双方在基本观点和具体问题上的看法一致，是对于社会主义和共产主义的建设进行极其重要的亲密合作，是对付可能的侵略者进行强有力的共同防御。中苏友谊是社会主义阵营各国之间的团结的基石，因此在维护和平和保障世界各地的人民的权利方面起着关键作用。
    可以预料得到，那些希望保持旧秩序的人们是难以接受这些生活的现实的。有些人（其中有我们的好朋友）听到我们这样谈论帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义的时候，就有一点震动。他们认为，我们未免有点幼稚，认为我们是低估美国战争机器的破坏力。
    对于这些朋友，我们说：我们已经为自由进行过这么长期和这么艰苦的斗争，所以我们是不会轻易低估敌人的，而恰恰你们必须正视历史的教训，打破你们已经过时的对他的迷信。回想苏联和中国革命的初期吧。那时，帝国主义者统治着世界。他们的工业能力使他们在武器方面占压倒的优势，他们用这些武器来残酷地镇压我们。我们两国人民简直是用干草叉打仗的！
    但是，伟大的苏联和中国人民在革命中取得了胜利，改变了人类走向未来的道路。他们是怎样做到的呢？他们没有神奇的单方，也没有“秘密武器”。他们只有坚持无可辩驳的马克思列宁主义真理的英勇战士的勇气和意志。这就是把千百万人民动员起来，变成一个不可攻破的坚固堡垒的动力。在过去四十多年中，这种“奇迹”一再出现。
    正如毛泽东主席指出的，帝国主义者缺乏这种道义力量，因为他们所关心的只是损人利己，他们永远对人民做坏事。一个在道义上不好的人或者政府可能在外表上是强大的，但是里面则是腐朽的和虚弱的——只不过是一只“纸老虎”而已。
    今天，苏联和中国的革命都已经巩固了。苏联已经进入全面开展共产主义社会建设的时期。最近召开的苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会，是一个向共产主义前进的大会。会上制订的1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的计划，是一个建设共产主义的伟大计划。这个大会向全人类展示了共产主义的壮丽远景。中国也在以飞跃的速度进行社会主义建设。我们的人民正在从胜利走向胜利，一个新的“大跃进”的图景正在我们面前展开。我们两个国家越来越强大，发展的速度简直要按小时计算。我们像两个巨人并肩站在世界上，站在用马克思列宁主义的友谊团结起来的九亿人民的社会主义阵营的中心。这种情况使世界各地的人民感到衷心的喜悦。人民众口一声地为此而欢呼，因为这是一支持久的力量，它像灯塔一样照耀着、鼓舞着那些仍然受着压迫的人们起来进行斗争，不管处境多么困难。因为毫无疑问，事实已经证明，“纸老虎”是可以戳穿的。
    苏联和中国热爱和平。在我们两国的友好同盟互助条约中，我们保证两国“……以忠诚的合作精神，参加所有以确保世界和平与安全为目的之国际活动，并为此目的之迅速实现充分贡献其力量。”
    这些年来，我们一直尽一切力量来履行这种和平保证。但是，我们看不到西方有同样的意愿。直到今天，还有一些身居高位的蠢人，硬把人类一再带到“战争边缘”，大谈要把我们的人民国家“推回去”。而且他们在远东有同谋者，这些人妄想他们能够恢复他们的进行战争的力量，以便参加这些“计划”。
    例如，东京的岸信介政府暗地里干修改日美“共同安全条约”的勾当。岸信介政府梦想恢复日本帝国主义，使它成为对整个亚洲的威胁。事实上，它正在把日本和日本人民拴在美国战争机器上面（而日本人民是不愿意这样做的），推行华盛顿所策划的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的造成自相残杀的计划。中国人民绝不允许日本的侵略再起；这种侵略曾经使中国人民和亚洲其他各地人民遭到巨大的牺牲。人们记得，中苏友好同盟互助条约宣布，两国“决心以加强中华人民共和国与苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟之间的友好与合作，共同防止日本帝国主义之再起及日本或其他用任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略”。
    这些“边缘人物”和他们的同谋者正在走向可鄙的战争贩子的坟墓。如果他们把他们卑鄙的计划推行得太远了，这肯定将是他们的下场。
    最近几个月以来，长期用武力霸占中国的领土台湾和其他沿海岛屿的美帝国主义者更加肆无忌惮地干涉我国的内政。他们企图大肆炫耀舰只、飞机和导弹来吓唬我们，阻止中国解放自己神圣的土地。解放台湾是中国国内战争中的没有完成的任务，只能由中国人民自己来解决。但是美国一直在非法干涉这件纯粹是我国内政的事情。它荒唐透顶地指责我们“侵略”我们自己，企图制造“两个中国”，以便永远夺去中国的这块领土，把它当作一个“不沉的航空母舰”（美国的发言人是这样称呼它的），来进攻我们和其他亚洲国家。
    显然中国人民决不会容忍这种蛮不讲理的行径和侵犯。在适当的时候，我们将收复台湾和我们的其他一切岛屿。美国企图威胁我们，但是它的话一说出口，我们的伟大朋友苏联就说明了自己的立场。尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫明确地宣布，对中华人民共和国的任何进攻将被看做是对苏联政府和人民的进攻。这就像是在那些头脑发热的人们的头上泼了一桶冷水。
    苏联和中国是吓唬不了的。“实力地位”影响不了我们。我们是现实主义者，我们知道真正的力量何在——在人民，在未来。帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义代表的是衰老和腐朽的东西。它已经完全暴露出自己的真面目，使人们认识到它是世界各地人民、包括帝国主义国家的人民在内的敌人。以苏联为中心的世界社会主义体系，得到社会主义国家支持的民族独立运动，世界其他地方无数的进步的、爱好和平的人民——它们代表新生的力量。它们肯定会战胜衰老和腐朽的力量，不管这些力量进行怎样的垂死挣扎。
    中苏友谊的辉煌记录和宏伟成就说明了它作为一支政治、经济和社会力量的伟大历史意义。这种友谊是从谋求人类幸福和繁荣的崇高愿望产生的，它已经成为一个不可动摇的堡垒，把世界上的愈来愈多的人团结在自己的周围。这种友谊是中国人民有理由引以为自豪的东西。它指出了走向人与人之间和国与国之间的关系中永远不再有剥削和压迫的光明的、前途无限的未来的道路，走向和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义的伟大时代的道路。（附图片）
