A Perspective on the U.S. Budget
Lu Guomu

The U.S. government's budget for the 1960 fiscal year has been officially released. U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in his budget message to Congress, emphatically stated: "This is a balanced budget," and "Revenue and expenditure are roughly equal, with a slight surplus." Judging from the figures, this is the case: "Budget revenue is $77.1 billion, budget expenditure is $77 billion, and the budget surplus is $100 million." In his budget message, Eisenhower also compared the 1960 fiscal year budget with the 1959 fiscal year budget, pointing out that the new budget's expenditure is $3.9 billion less than the previous year's. It seems that Eisenhower is truly "tightening government spending and maintaining a balanced budget."

Of course, Eisenhower is not doing this to reduce the burden on the American people. On the contrary, he has already requested in his budget message to increase gasoline tax and postage rates, and to extend the decision not to cut consumer taxes for another year. Thus, it can be seen that Eisenhower is actually increasing the burden on the American people.

The real reason that prompted Eisenhower to propose a "balanced budget" must be found in the American economic crisis. Since the autumn of 1957, the United States has been mired in the most serious economic crisis since the war. This crisis was primarily a crisis of overproduction, mainly manifested in a sharp decline in industrial production (the industrial production index fell from 145 in August 1957 to 126 in April 1958, a decrease of 13.1%) and a rapid increase in unemployment (unemployment in June 1958 rose to 5.43 million, the highest peak in sixteen years); later, it developed into a financial crisis, which is the surge in fiscal deficits and the malignant development of inflation. The Eisenhower administration once tried to cope with the crisis of overproduction by artificially increasing government spending and relaxing credit. As a result, although industrial production has "rebounded" somewhat after May 1958 (the industrial production index increased to 142 in December 1958, still lower than the level before the crisis), the fundamental contradiction that caused this crisis, in Eisenhower's words, namely "production capacity has increased considerably, but demand has not increased correspondingly," remains serious. Not only that, but as a result of the government's "spending spree," the United States is facing the most severe fiscal deficit and inflation since the war. Eisenhower has had to admit in his budget message that the budget deficit for the 1959 fiscal year will reach $12.9 billion, and the national debt will reach an unprecedented record of $285 billion. The situation of inflation is also becoming increasingly serious. In the past year, the currency issued by the government has increased by $13 billion. Therefore, the dollar is also worth less. Currently, the dollar's purchasing power is only 48% of its pre-war value. The devaluation of the dollar has also caused an outflow of gold, with $2.4 billion flowing out last year alone. As a result of inflation, prices have also risen. Even according to the materials provided by Eisenhower in his recent economic message, the current U.S. consumer price index has risen by approximately 2% compared to a year ago. All of these situations have made Eisenhower extremely uneasy. As early as last November, he exclaimed: If government spending continues to increase substantially, it "will bankrupt the United States." Recently, he also called for a "declaration of war" on inflation in his economic message. This is the true background behind Eisenhower's forced proposal of the so-called "balanced budget."

"Spending sprees" have failed to stop the deepening of the economic crisis, so how will a "balanced budget" fare? First of all, it must be pointed out that whether the new budget for the 1960 fiscal year can truly achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure remains a question. According to the "New York Times," this is an "unreliable balance." Take the new budget revenue as an example. In this year of deep crisis, raising such a huge sum of $77.1 billion is indeed not an easy task. According to Eisenhower's budget message, even with some "rebound" in industrial production, the government's revenue for the 1959 fiscal year is estimated to be only $68 billion. If this number is used to estimate the new budget revenue, there is still a shortfall of $9.1 billion. Therefore, Eisenhower pins his hopes on measures such as raising gasoline tax and postage rates to intensify the squeeze on the people. However, according to the "New York Times," revenue from these areas will only add up to $1.3 billion, which is far from enough to offset this shortfall. Even the American "Time Magazine" believes that the budget for the 1960 fiscal year "will still have a deficit of more than $3 billion." On the other hand, it is not certain that the new budget expenditure can be reduced. Because those monopoly groups that obtain huge profits from government orders, especially those large enterprises that manufacture military equipment, are currently exerting great pressure on the Eisenhower administration through Democratic congressmen they control, demanding that the government continue to expand spending, even at the risk of a deficit. In fact, Eisenhower has not ignored the interests of these monopoly groups. He has already stated in his budget message: "The government's budget is proposed by the President, but it is decided by Congress," "Only Congress has the power to spend money, so the responsibility for determining the scope and amount of federal spending ultimately rests with Congress." This statement fully exposes Eisenhower's lack of confidence in his own proposed "balanced budget." However, he played a "political trick," attempting to shift the responsibility for the budget's imbalance onto the Democratic-controlled Congress.

Not only that, Eisenhower's new budget is still a budget for expanding armaments and preparing for war. The military expenditure stipulated in the budget (including the Department of Defense's military spending, the atomic energy program, strategic material reserves, and foreign military "aid" four items) still amounts to $45.8 billion, accounting for 59.5% of the total expenditure, while last year's military expenditure accounted for 57% of the budget expenditure. It is thus clear that the new budget will continue to expand military preparations.

Although expanding armaments does have a stimulating effect on the U.S. economy, it cannot solve the crisis of overproduction; on the contrary, it has brought about serious consequences of fiscal deficits and inflation. The situation in 1958 (calendar year) is an example. Last year, the Eisenhower administration's expenditure on expanding armaments reached a new peak in peacetime. According to statistics recently released by the U.S. Department of Defense, military orders alone amounted to $21.8 billion in 1958, $3.8 billion higher than the $18 billion in 1957. The amount belonging to missile orders had reached $5.3 billion by the middle of the year. Even so, U.S. industrial production still did not escape the困境 of the crisis last year. This is mainly manifested in the general insufficient operating rate and a sharp reduction in output. According to recent statistics in the U.S. press, the average index of U.S. industrial production for the entire year of 1958 was only 134, a decrease of 6.5% compared to the average index of 143 for the entire year of 1957. Among them, the heavy industry sector declined the most. For example, the average operating rate of the steel industry for the entire year was only 60%; steel production was only more than 84 million tons, a decrease of 25% compared to 1957. The situation in the automobile industry was even worse, with an average operating rate of only 40% for the entire year; and production was reduced to 4.24 million vehicles, the lowest annual output in ten years. The production of other industries such as coal, petroleum, aluminum, and durable consumer goods has also been greatly reduced. This reduction in production has also affected the expansion of enterprises. According to preliminary statistics, corporate fixed capital investment in 1958 was only $29.6 billion, a decrease of 21% compared to 1957; especially manufacturing investment, which decreased by 28%. Facts have proved that huge military expenditures are not a "panacea" for the economic crisis.

Secondly, in order to achieve a superficial "balance," the new budget, while continuing to maintain huge military expenditures, has also drastically cut civilian expenditures. The items stipulated in the budget to be cut are mainly: expenditures on commerce and housing construction decreased by $1.3 billion, expenditures on agriculture (mainly used to acquire surplus agricultural products and subsidize agricultural product prices) decreased by $800 million, and expenditures on "labor and welfare" decreased by $250 million. It is not difficult to see that this is a budget that attacks the welfare of the working people. The result of cutting civilian expenditures will inevitably promote the accelerated development of the economic crisis. Because the current situation in construction, agriculture, and labor is not as "wonderful" as the U.S. government claims. According to recent statistics in the U.S. press, the total value of national construction in 1958 was $49 billion, an increase of 2% compared to 1957 (if the inflation factor is taken into account, there is actually no increase); among them, the number of private residential starts for the entire year was 1,129,200, an increase of 87,300 compared to 1957. The reason why the construction industry has not declined like industry is entirely due to the support of government mortgage loans. In April last year, in order to prevent the economic crisis from spreading indefinitely, the Eisenhower administration repeatedly relaxed the limits of government-guaranteed escrow amounts, stimulating residential construction to maintain "prosperity." It is estimated that by November last year, construction funded by the government had increased by $4 billion compared to 1957. Therefore, the new budget's cut in expenditures in this area means that the construction industry will lose its reliance on this artificial stimulus, and the risk of decline will also appear. The situation in agriculture is even worse. U.S. agricultural production has long been in a state of oversupply. Although the U.S. government has taken measures such as reducing the area of cultivated land to limit agricultural production, agricultural production still increased by 11% in 1958, which is equivalent to another "disaster of abundance." In the United States, surplus agricultural products without a market are handled by government purchases. The current surplus agricultural products piled up in the hands of the U.S. government that have no way to sell have reached $8.3 billion. Therefore, the new budget's cut in expenditures in agriculture will inevitably aggravate the crisis of overproduction in agriculture and cause serious difficulties for small and medium-sized farmers. The situation in labor is even more serious. The most prominent is the problem of mass unemployment. According to preliminary official U.S. statistics alone, the average number of unemployed people for the entire year of 1958 reached 4.69 million, setting a new record in sixteen years. Moreover, the U.S. press estimates that the number of unemployed people will increase in 1959. However, Eisenhower completely ignores such a serious problem and instead cuts expenditures on labor (mainly cutting the additional unemployment relief funds added last year) in the new budget, which will subject the lives of the working people to even more serious threats.

In short, the so-called "balanced budget" proposed by Eisenhower is nothing more than a self-deceiving trick. Eisenhower himself knows that the government's "spending spree" has already led to a financial crisis; the government's "tightening of expenditures" will aggravate the crisis of overproduction. After all calculations, the economic crisis still cannot be solved. This reflects the current dilemma in which the U.S. ruling group finds itself in. However, there is one principle that Eisenhower will not abandon, and that is to continue expanding armaments and preparing for war in order to maintain the high profits of the monopoly groups. Obviously, Eisenhower's "balanced budget" is formulated according to this principle, and the result will only be to transfer the heavy burden of the economic crisis onto the American people. This is the true essence of the "balanced budget."

    美国预算的透视
    陆果木
    美国政府的1960财政年度预算已经正式出笼了。美国总统艾森豪威尔在向国会提出的预算咨文中极力强调：“这是一项平衡的预算”，“收支大体相等，还稍有结余”。如果从账面上来看，情况是这样：“预算收入七百七十一亿美元，预算支出七百七十亿美元，预算结余一亿美元”。艾森豪威尔在其预算咨文中还将1960财政年度预算和1959财政年度预算作了一个比较，指出新预算在支出方面比上一年度预算支出少了三十九亿美元。看来，艾森豪威尔真像是在“紧缩政府开支，保持预算平衡”。
    艾森豪威尔这样做当然不是为了减轻美国人民的负担。相反的，他已在预算咨文中要求提高汽油税和邮资、并延长不削减消费税的决定有效期一年。由此可见，艾森豪威尔实际上是要加重美国人民的负担。
    促使艾森豪威尔提出“平衡的预算”的真实原因，必须从美国经济危机上来找，自从1957年秋季以来，美国一直陷在战后最严重的一次经济危机之中。这次危机首先是生产过剩的危机，主要表现在工业生产猛烈下降（工业生产指数从1957年8月的145跌至1958年4月的126，下降了13.1％）和失业人数迅速增加（1958年6月失业人数增至五百四十三万，达十六年来的最高峰）；后来又发展到财政金融危机，这就是财政赤字激增和通货膨胀的恶性发展。艾森豪威尔政府曾经力图用增加政府开支和放松信贷的人为办法来对付生产过剩的危机。结果，工业生产虽然在1958年5月以后有所“回升”（1958年12月工业生产指数增至142，仍低于危机开始前的水平），但造成这次危机的根本矛盾，用艾森豪威尔的话来说，即“生产能力有过相当大的增长，但需求量却没有相应的增加”，至今依然严重存在。不仅如此，由于政府“大量花钱”的结果，已使美国面临战后以来最恶化的财政赤字和通货膨胀的局面。艾森豪威尔在其预算咨文中已不得不承认：1959财政年度的预算赤字将达一百二十九亿美元，国债将创二千八百五十亿美元的空前记录。通货膨胀的情况也愈来愈严重。一年来，政府发行的通货增加了一百三十亿美元。因此，美元也更不值钱。目前美元购买力仅值战前的48％。美元贬值又引起了黄金外流，去年一年外流黄金达二十四亿美元。由于通货膨胀的结果，物价也随之上涨。即使根据艾森豪威尔最近在其经济咨文中提供的材料，目前美国消费品价格指数，也比一年前上升了大约2％。所有这些情况，已使艾森豪威尔极度不安。还在去年11月间，他就曾惊呼：政府开支再大量增加，“将使美国破产”。最近，他又在经济咨文中要求对通货膨胀“宣战”。这就是艾森豪威尔被迫提出所谓“平衡的预算”的真实背景。
    “大量花钱”没有能够制止经济危机深入发展，那么，“平衡的预算”又将如何呢？首先必须指出，1960财政年度的新预算是否真能收支平衡，仍然是个疑问。照“纽约时报”的说法，这是一种“靠不住的平衡”。就拿新预算收入来说，当此危机深重的年头里，要想筹足七百七十一亿美元这样一笔巨款，确实不是一件容易的事情。据艾森豪威尔的预算咨文透露：即使在工业生产已有某些“回升”的情况下，1959财政年度的政府收入，估计也只有六百八十亿美元。如以此数来估量新预算收入，还是短差九十一亿美元。因而，艾森豪威尔把希望寄托在提高汽油税和邮资等加紧搜括人民的措施上。但是，据“纽约时报”估计，这些方面的收入，总共只能增添十三亿美元，也远不足以抵消这个差额。就连美国“时代周刊”也认为1960财政年度的预算，“仍将有三十亿美元以上的赤字”。另一方面，新预算支出也不是肯定能减得了的。因为，那些从政府订货中获取巨额利润的垄断集团，特别是那些承制军备的大企业，目前正在通过控制国会的民主党议员，对艾森豪威尔政府大施压力，要求政府继续扩大开支，甚至不惜冒赤字风险。其实，艾森豪威尔也并未忽视这些垄断集团的利益。他在预算咨文中已经作了声明：“政府的预算是由总统提出的，但是它由国会作出决定”，“唯有国会才有花钱的权力，因此决定联邦开支的范围和数字的责任最后落在国会肩上”。这一声明，充分暴露了艾森豪威尔对于自己所提出的“平衡的预算”也是没有信心的。不过，他玩了一个“政治手法”，企图将预算失去平衡的责任推在民主党所控制的国会身上。
    不仅如此，艾森豪威尔的新预算，依然是个扩军备战预算。预算规定的军事费用（包括国防部军费、原子能计划、战略物资储备和对外军事“援助”四个项目），仍然高达四百五十八亿美元，占整个开支的59.5％，而上一年度的军事费用占预算开支的57％。由此可见，新预算还是要继续扩充军备。
    扩充军备对于美国经济固然有其刺激作用，但它毕竟不能解救生产过剩的危机；反之，倒已带来了财政赤字和通货膨胀的严重后果。1958年（日历年度）的情况就是一个例证。去年一年，艾森豪威尔政府用来扩充军备的开支，达到了和平时期的新高峰。据美国国防部最近发表的统计，单是军事订货一项，1958年就有二百一十八亿美元，比1957年的一百八十亿美元高出三十八亿美元。其中属于导弹订货的款项，迄至年中已达五十三亿美元。即使如此，去年美国工业生产还是没有摆脱危机的困境。这主要表现在开工率普遍不足和产量大减。据美国报刊最近统计：1958年美国工业生产全年平均指数仅为134，比1957年的全年平均指数143下降了6.5％。其中重工业部门下降得最厉害。例如：钢铁业全年开工率平均仅达60％；钢产量只有八千四百多万吨，比1957年减少了25％。汽车工业情况更惨，全年开工率平均仅达40％；而产量减至四百二十四万辆，为十年来产量最低的一年。其他如煤、石油、铝和耐用消费品等工业的产量，也都有很大缩减。这种减产情况，并已影响企业的扩充。据初步统计，1958年企业的固定资本投资仅为二百九十六亿美元，比1957年减少21％；尤其是制造业的投资，减了28％。事实证明，巨额军事开支对于经济危机来说，也并不是什么“万灵药”。
    其次新预算为了达到表面上的“平衡”，在继续维持庞大军费开支的同时，还大量削减了民用开支。预算规定削减的项目，主要为：用在商业和房屋建筑方面的开支减少十三亿美元，用在农业方面的开支（主要用来收购剩余农产品和补贴农产品价格）减少八亿美元，用在“劳工与福利”方面的开支减少二亿五千万美元。不难看出，这是一个向劳动人民福利进攻的预算。而削减民用开支的结果，势将促使经济危机的加剧发展。因为目前建筑业、农业和劳工方面的情况，也并不像美国官方所吹嘘的那样“美妙”。据美国报刊最近统计，1958年全国建筑总值为四百九十亿美元，比1957年增加了2％（如将物价上涨因素估计在内，实际上并无增加）；其中私人住宅动工数全年为一百一十二万九千二百幢，较1957年增加了八万七千三百幢。建筑业所以没有像工业那样下降，完全是靠政府的抵押贷款支持的。去年4月间，艾森豪威尔政府为了预防经济危机无边蔓延，曾一再放宽政府担保的押款限额，刺激住宅建筑保持“兴旺”。据估计，到去年11月，属于政府出钱的建筑，比1957年增多了四十亿美元。所以，新预算削减这方面的开支，即意味着建筑业将要失去这一人为刺激的依靠，同样会出现下降的险象。农业方面的情况更是不妙。美国农业生产久已处在过剩状态。尽管美国政府曾经采取缩小耕地面积等办法来限制农业生产。但1958年农业还是增产了11％，这等于是又来了一次“丰收之灾”。在美国，市场无着的过剩农产品，都是靠政府收购来处理的。目前堆积在美国政府手中而无路销售的剩余农产品，已达八十三亿美元。因此，新预算削减农业方面的开支，势必加重农业生产过剩的危机，并对中小农户造成严重的困难。劳工方面的情况更严重。最突出的是大量失业问题。仅据美国官方初步统计，1958年全年平均的失业人数竟达四百六十九万，创十六年来的最高纪录。而且，美国报刊估计，1959年失业人数还会增加。但是，艾森豪威尔根本漠视这样一个严重问题，反在新预算中削减用于劳工方面的开支（主要是削减去年追加的失业救济金），这将使劳动人民的生活受到更加严重的威胁。
    总之，艾森豪威尔提出的所谓“平衡的预算”，不过是个自欺欺人的骗术而已。艾森豪威尔自己也知道：政府“大量花钱”，已经招致财政金融危机；政府“紧缩开支”，又要加剧生产过剩危机。算来算去，经济危机还是无法解决。这正反映了美国统治集团目前已处在进退两难的困境之中。不过，有一条原则，艾森豪威尔是不会放弃的，那就是继续扩军备战，保持垄断集团的高额利润。显然，艾森豪威尔的“平衡的预算”，就是按照这一原则来拟定的，其结果自然只有把经济危机的沉重负担转嫁在美国人民身上。这也就是“平衡的预算”的真实本质。
