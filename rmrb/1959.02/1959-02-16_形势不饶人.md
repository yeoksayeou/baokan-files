The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party – what kind of reaction has it aroused among the working masses? What is the greatest demand of the working masses at present?

Let me first give an example from an investigation.

The production of the undershirt workshop of a knitting factory in Qingdao increased by 66% last year compared to 1957. The initial determination for this year's output is to increase by another 41% compared to last year. After receiving the plan, the workshop director thought that the new year had just begun, so he should rest for a few days before talking about it. He did not announce the plan to the masses, and he did not organize solutions to many technical problems in production in a timely manner. In mid-January, the factory Party committee conveyed the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. One day, as soon as the workshop director entered the workshop, an old worker grabbed his clothes and asked, "Director, are we still going to have a Great Leap Forward this year?" He immediately replied casually, "Great Leap Forward? Of course, we're going to have a Great Leap Forward!" Back in his office, he pondered and realized that the old worker's words had a deeper meaning. He suddenly remembered the production plan. Upon inspection, he found that the daily output had not been completed for several days. So, he immediately convened a meeting of the entire workshop that day, made a self-criticism, mobilized all the workers to discuss this year's production tasks, adopted technical measures, and launched a red flag competition. Sure enough, production rose from the next day, and the daily plan was overfulfilled on the third day. The workshop director believed that he had received another vivid education on the general line of socialist construction.

"Are we still going to have a Great Leap Forward this year?" This sentence is profound and sincere. The workers have their own views. The broad masses of workers are filled with infinite pride and joy for the Great Leap Forward of 1958, and they are full of confidence in a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. This old worker was encouraged by the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Seeing that other factories and other workshops had already set up positions for the Leap Forward, he was dissatisfied with the bleak situation and the workshop director's approach. He felt depressed, so he raised this question, representing the opinions of the workers in the workshop. This is not accidental. They know that there will be a greater harvest of cotton this year, and the people's needs for clothing across the country should be better met. They have a high sense of responsibility, so they demand a greater increase in production. In fact, it is not just the knitting factory; which factory's employees are not like this? Just go to the factory and ask, and you will understand: now the workers and masses want to know what the factory's production plan is in the national steel, coal, grain, and cotton plans, and how much it will increase compared to 1958? What is their own production task? How much does the entire factory and individual complete each day, and how does it compare with others? These indicators are so attractive. All factories that have mobilized the masses to discuss this year's production plan have not only raised the plan higher than the state's requirements, but also have practical and reliable measures. The masses use practical actions to answer the Party: this year's greater, better, and more comprehensive Leap Forward plan must be absolutely completed and is completely capable of being completed.

This year's spring is early. After the earth-shaking changes of 1958, the ideological awareness of the broad masses of workers has greatly improved compared to the beginning of last year's Great Leap Forward. Go to the factory and experience it; everywhere is a surge of enthusiasm, everywhere is the atmosphere of a new battle. Resolutely respond to the Party's call, grasp the pulse of the masses, and more quickly, more bravely, and more actively lead the masses to set off a greater wave of the Leap Forward. This task is urgently placed before every enterprise leader!

For a person who directs production, time waits for no one, and the situation waits for no one. If you don't take the initiative to move forward, you will miss the opportunity.

    形势不饶人

    党的八届六中全会决议，在工人群众中引起的反应是什么？工人群众当前最大的要求是什么？
    让我先举一个从调查中得到的例子。
    青岛一家针织厂汗衫车间的生产，去年比1957年提高了66％。今年的产量，初步确定要比去年再增长41％。车间主任接到计划后，认为新年刚过，先歇几天再说，就没有向群众公布计划，生产里有不少技术问题，他也没有及时组织解决。到1月中旬，厂党委传达了党的八届六中全会决议。有一天，车间主任刚进车间，就被一位老工人拉住衣服问他说：“主任，咱们今年还跃进不跃进？”他马上随口答道：“大跃进?，怎么不跃进？”他回到办公室一思索，觉得那位老工人话中有话，猛然想起了生产计划。一检查，才发现已经有好几天没有完成日产量了。于是当天就召开了全车间大会，自己作了检查，发动全体工人讨论了今年的生产任务，采取了技术措施，开展了红旗竞赛。说来也快，从第二天起生产就上升，第三天就超额完成了当天计划。结果1月份计划提前完成了。这位车间主任认为又受到一次生动的社会主义建设总路线的教育。
    “今年咱们还跃进不跃进？”这句话问得深刻，问得恳切。工人是有自己的看法的。广大职工对于1958年的大跃进充满无限自豪和欢乐的心情，对于今年更大更好更全面的跃进，满怀信心。这位老工人受到了党的八届六中全会决议的鼓舞，看到了另外厂和别的车间都摆开了跃进的阵势，对本车间冷清的局面和车间主任的做法不满意，心里发闷，才提出这个问题来的，他代表了车间工人的意见。这不是偶然的，他们知道今年棉花要有更大丰收，全国人民穿衣的需要应该更好地满足，他们有高度的责任感，因此他们要求更大地提高生产。其实，不光是针织厂，哪一个工厂的职工不这样呢？只要到工厂里去问问，便会明白：现在职工群众要求知道在全国钢煤粮棉计划中本厂的生产计划是多少，比1958年提高多少？自己的生产任务多少？每天全厂和个人计划完成多少，比别人怎样？这些指标那样地吸引人心。凡是发动群众讨论了今年生产计划的厂，制订出来的计划不仅比国家要求提高了，而且有切实可靠的措施。群众用实际行动向党回答：今年更大更好更全面的跃进计划，是绝对必须完成和完全能够完成的。
    今年春早。广大职工群众经过1958年翻天复地的大变化，思想觉悟比去年大跃进开始时又大大地提高了。到工厂中去体验一下，到处是热气奔腾，到处是一场新的战斗的气氛。坚决响应党的号召，掌握群众的脉搏，更迅速更勇敢更积极地带领群众，掀起一个更大的跃进浪潮，这个任务，迫切地摆在每一个企业领导同志的面前了！
    对于一个指挥生产的人来说，时间不饶人，形势不饶人，倘不主动向前，便会错过时机。
