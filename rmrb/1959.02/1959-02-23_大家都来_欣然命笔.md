Let's All "Write With Joy"
Shan Bai

"The worst fault in writing is to follow in others' footsteps." The ancients warned us long ago, but I still knowingly violate this principle, because I feel that someone has expressed an idea so well that I cannot help but do some voluntary promotion for it.

An old playwright said that writing literary works should be like Chairman Mao writing the "Two Poems on Seeing Off the God of Plague" - "writing with joy" - only then can one write well. What insightful words!

From "writing with joy," one can imagine a series of scenes: a "sleepless" night of "boundless thoughts," dawn breaks, "a gentle breeze caresses, the rising sun shines through the window," the scenery is so beautiful, the mood is so pleasant, "gazing at the southern sky," thinking that schistosomiasis has been eradicated on a large piece of land over there, the eyes are full of spring breeze willows, green waters and green mountains... Six hundred million people are doing great things that Yao and Shun could not do, or even imagine!

Please take another look at the characters on the printed original manuscript. When writing the second poem praising the new era, those characters became even more unrestrained and vigorous. Look at those particularly large characters, the "spring" of "spring breeze," the "move" of "earth shakes," and even the final, larger "burn" - they give people a visual image that fully matches the content of the poem, revealing the poet's joy and making people think of a people's power that swallows mountains and rivers.

Shouldn't poetry, all literary works, be written like this? The ancients had the saying of "a brushstroke that comes from inspiration," the metaphor of "pen singing and ink dancing," the praise of "understanding with the heart and comprehending with the spirit" and "unrestrained and vivid," and foreigners also have the term "inspiration"...

How different is this situation from the "forced writing" that critics talk about when they say "poetry cannot be forced"!

However, saying this is not to mystify creation, nor is it to oppose all organizational work, such as editing work; it is only to say that the method of organization should be careful, and do not force the author to write about topics that they are not interested in or familiar with, and do not force the author to adopt styles and forms that they are not good at. We can advocate and promote, but we should not prescribe and limit to death. We must be good at making the author "write with joy."

And the author should also be good at pursuing that state of "writing with joy," to go deep into the masses, breathe with the people, and be good at writing works that meet the wishes of the people. Our predecessors are our role models. Lu Xun was happy to write "literature by order," and Mayakovsky was happy to accept telephone commissions from newspaper editorial departments. He said: "In my opinion, the best poems should be written based on the social order of the Third International..."

"Order" is a bit harsh, but it is the people's "order," the Party's "order," and what is written is not an eight-legged essay, but the "best poem"! It is the same as "writing on a given topic," it can be "a perfunctory work," or it can be "an expression of temperament." The problem lies in the author's need to be at one with the masses, to adjust their own thoughts and feelings, to make their mental state closely match the spiritual state of the people, to take the needs of the people as their own needs, and to take the love and hatred of the people as their own love and hatred.

Only "spirited" authors can reflect a "spirited" era. Let us all "write with joy"!

### 大家都来“欣然命笔”

    大家都来“欣然命笔”
    山柏
    “文章最忌随人后”，古人早已警告过，可我还要明知故犯，因为觉得人家把一个意思说得实在好，就情不自禁地想作一番义务宣传。
    一位老剧作家说，写文艺作品应该像毛主席写“送瘟神二首”那样“欣然命笔”，才能写得好。真是旨哉言乎！
    从“欣然命笔”，可以想起一连串的情景：一个“浮想联翩”的“不寐”之夜，天亮了，“微风拂煦，旭日临窗”，景色是那样的美妙，心境是那样的愉快，“遥望南天”，想到那边一大片土地上已经消灭了血吸虫病，满眼是春风杨柳，绿水青山……六亿人民正在做着尧舜也做不到、甚至想不到的宏伟事业！
    请再看看制版印出的原稿上的字吧，写到第二首对新时代的赞美时，那些字益发潇洒奔放了。你看那几个写得特别大的字，“春风”的“春”字，“地动”的“动”字，以至于最后更大的“烧”字，它们给人以视觉的形象，充分地配合了诗的内容，流露着诗人的欣慰之情，使人联想到一股气吞河山的人民的力量。
    诗歌，一切文艺作品，难道不应该是这样写出来吗？古人有“兴到之笔”的说法，有“笔歌墨舞”的比喻，有“心领神会”“酣畅淋漓”的赞叹，外国也有“烟士比里纯”（灵感）的术语……
    这种情形和批评家所说的“诗不可强作”的“强作”多么不同！
    但是，这末说，并不是把创作神秘化，也不是反对一切的组织工作，例如编辑工作等；只是说，组织的方法要讲究，不要勉强作者去写他所不感兴趣的、不熟悉的题材，不要勉强作者去采用他所不擅长的样式、形式。可以鼓吹，提倡，却不宜规定，限死。要善于使作者“欣然命笔”。
    而作者也应该善于追求那种“欣然命笔”的境界，要深入群众，同人民呼吸相通，善于写出符合人民愿望的作品来。前人是我们的榜样，鲁迅乐于写“遵命文学”，马雅可夫斯基乐于接受报馆编辑部的电话约稿，他说：“用我的观点说，最好的诗篇应当是根据第三国际的社会订货而写作……”
    “订货”，未免刺耳，然而这是人民的“订货”，党的“订货”，而写出来的也不是八股试帖，而是“最好的诗”！同样是“出题作文”，可以是“应付敷衍之作”，也可以是“性情流露之篇”。问题在于作者要和群众打成一片，要调整自己的思想感情，使自己的精神状态密合于人民的精神状态，以人民的需要为需要，以人民的爱憎为爱憎。
    只有“意气风发”的作者才能反映“意气风发”的时代。让我们大家都来“欣然命笔”吧！
