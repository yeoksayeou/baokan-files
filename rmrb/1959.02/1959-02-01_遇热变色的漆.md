	Heat-sensitive paint is a new product produced in Shanghai. When this paint is applied to an object and exposed to a certain temperature, it changes from its original color to another color, in order to attract people's attention, thereby preventing accidents in a timely manner. This paint is specially used for indoor and outdoor electrical appliances, motors, bearings, and other machine parts that are prone to heat generation and require not to heat up.
    Heat-sensitive paint is also known as heat indicator paint, and it is made of paint materials and special pigments. This paint is divided into two types, reversible and irreversible, depending on the color-changing pigments used. Reversible color-changing paint changes color when exposed to a certain temperature, and the color returns to normal when the temperature returns to normal. Irreversible paint will not return to its original color.

    遇热变色的漆
    本报讯　遇热变色漆是上海生产的一种新产品。这种油漆涂在物体上，遇到一定的热度就会从原来的颜色变成另一种颜色，以便引起人们的注意，从而可以及时防止发生事故。这种油漆是专门用于室内外的电器、电动机、轴承以及其他容易发热而要求其不发热的机件上的。
    遇热变色漆又称热度指示漆，它是油漆料和特种颜料制成的。这漆又根据所用变色颜料的不同，而分为可逆性与不可逆性二种。可逆性的变色漆即遇到一定热度就变色，当热度恢复常态时，颜色即复原，不可逆性就不会复原。
