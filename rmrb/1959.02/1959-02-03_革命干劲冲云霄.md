Revolutionary Enthusiasm Soars to the Sky
By Our Correspondent

The sound of gongs and drums grew louder and louder, and the meeting place simply wouldn't quiet down. Only when the deputy secretary of the Party committee was about to report on the factory's production completion for January did it finally quiet down with great difficulty.

The deputy secretary of the Party committee said: "Our North China Radio Factory made a flying start in 1959. In the first ten days of January, the output value completed 172%, and in the middle ten days, it completed 114.2%. Twenty workshops should receive the Leap Forward Red Flag, and the Second Branch Factory should receive a comprehensive Leap Forward Red Flag..."

Applause and laughter merged into one, and people excitedly shouted slogans. Workers from one workshop shouted: "Attack quality like fierce tigers, capture high yield like dragons," while workers from another workshop shouted: "Our products are good and good, they can go to heaven and enter the earth, launch satellites into the moon palace, and create miracles by improving quality."

People ran to the stage to express their determination. The representative of the Second Branch Factory, which won the comprehensive Leap Forward Red Flag, couldn't help but recite a poem: "Leap Forward Red Flag flies in the Second Factory, the Second Factory will never be proud. Make persistent efforts and leap forward again, report good news before the Spring Festival."

        Four Times Longer in Four Days

We took a tour of the Second Branch Factory and saw workers wearing white work clothes and rubber gloves, sitting at their workbenches, working intently. The walls of the workshop were covered with all kinds of charts and paintings, on which were written the workshop's plans, measures, and key projects. Some even wrote out the responsible persons and dates for solving key projects in detail.

We walked up to a female worker and asked about the production task for this month. She said confidently, "50,000." After saying that, she said embarrassedly that she had made a fool of herself more than twenty days ago. On the 4th, the factory director came to the workshop and asked about the task for this month, and she was immediately stumped. She vaguely remembered a "five" and blurted out, "500,000." After saying that, she felt it wouldn't be that many, and immediately changed her mind and said, "50,000." After saying that, she felt it wasn't right, so she had to honestly say, "I don't know." To be honest, she had taken two days off for the New Year, and her heart couldn't be brought back. In addition, she had a kind of thinking that the factory's production last year was good, it had increased twelvefold in a year, and after the New Year, she should have a good rest, so she didn't listen carefully when the workshop arranged tasks.

Unexpectedly, this situation attracted the attention of the Party committee. The Party committee held a meeting that day to study and proposed a new action slogan: "Grasp production firmly and make a flying start!" The next day, the whole factory was mobilized. The factory's propaganda personnel went everywhere to tell people: "1959 is a year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. The factory's task is more than four times greater than the previous year. Everyone must work harder."

The workshop's propagandists drew many charts and paintings and posted the plans and measures on the walls. The workshop pre-checked, and everyone met and tested each other: What are the workshop, group, and your individual monthly, weekly, and daily plans? What are the key points of the workshop? How to solve them?

On the 8th, the whole factory organized a 500-person inspection team. The departments related to production checked each other. They checked for three days, checking whether everyone knew the workshop's plan and key points? Are there specific measures to solve the key points? Check whether civilized production and production order are good? How is the technical revolution going?

This time, production took a turn for the better, and the output increased four times in just four days.

        The Material Section is Relaxed

We went to visit the material section. Everyone muttered along the way that materials were so tight that the comrades in the section must be extremely busy, and they probably didn't have time to talk to us. When we ran to the office, it was strange. The room was quiet, with only three people working. Li Fengyan, the leader of the planning and scheduling group, said that if we had come to interview the material section at the end of last year, we really wouldn't have found time to talk. At that time, hundreds of people would come to urge delivery every day. They would sit around the office and not leave, and some individuals would even say some inappropriate things: "What is your material section for? Are you responsible for the failure to complete the production task?" The comrades in the material section were so busy that they couldn't even drink a mouthful of water all day long, and they couldn't even take a nap in the office at night. A phone call would come every now and then to urge materials. The section was so busy that it had to pull in people who could write and calculate from the laboratory, the motorcade, and the warehouse to help. Everyone worked for several consecutive nights, but it still didn't help.

What to do? This year's task will be several times longer. Where will the materials come from? The comrades in the material section were so worried that they went to the Party committee. The Party committee held a special meeting on this matter, calling on everyone to mobilize the masses and increase income and reduce expenditure. Soon, the inspection team came down to inspect. Li Fengyan recalled the scene at that time. He said that he was assigned to the Third Branch Factory to inspect. When he went down, he found many problems. Some workshops had set their plans too large, some used large materials as small materials, and some used expensive materials as cheap materials. Some individual workshops had some materials that they didn't need, but they were unwilling to give them to others. Before leaving, they convened a forum with the workers and material clerks in the workshop. At the meeting, they talked about the tight supply of materials and asked everyone to find a way.

Since then, good news has been constantly coming: the Sixteenth Workshop didn't have silicon steel sheets, so the workers used small materials and scraps instead; they didn't have enameled wire, so they repaired the scrapped old wire. The Fourth Branch Factory didn't have materials, so the workers dismantled the waste molds and took down the usable parts to use. The workers made so many things! They made carbolic acid, steel balls, calcium carbide, and more than a dozen high-grade alloys. The material section no longer felt so burdened.

        First of all, There Must Be Drive

We went to the Fourth Branch Factory, which manufactures machinery and tooling. Yuan Guangru, the deputy director of the technical department, said that after the general inspection, the workers were very motivated. They invented and created many machines. For example, the Fourth Workshop used to take seven or eight hours to cut threads and screw threads. After the self-modified whirlwind cutting method, the efficiency was increased by 120 times. The Sixth Workshop used to be able to make only one or two cylinders a day. Recently, after changing the work method, it can make more than a dozen a day. The Third Workshop changed the single-head cutter of the milling machine to a double-head cutter, which improved efficiency several times. After worker Wang Longchang saw Wang Chonglun's invention of the universal tool embryo, he improved his planer. Now his planer can not only plane flat surfaces, but also replace the slotting machine to plane various arcs... We walked to the Sixth Workshop and saw a large group of people binding a thick pipe and channel steel with steel wire. Several people were pouring cement into wooden troughs. People traveling with us said that the workers were using indigenous methods to build a six-meter gantry planer. It would take at least half a year to make a foreign planer, but this indigenous one could be made in just one month. We walked a few steps forward and saw a frame made of iron plates. People said that this was a two-and-a-half-meter indigenous vertical lathe made by the workers. It would have taken more than a dozen tons of metal materials to make such a lathe, but now it was made by piecing together small materials.

Yuan Guangru stopped here and said that now that he recalled the scene when he discussed the plan at the end of last year, he felt really funny. At that time, everyone opened their hands and shouted: "We are short of 50 tons of steel in January, how can we make machines and tooling?" "We should use the spirit of scientific analysis to make plans!" As a result, the plan could not be made. After the Party committee knew about it, it asked everyone to study and discuss the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. What is scientific analysis? Does scientific analysis mean not having soaring enthusiasm? Can difficulties not be overcome? Immediately afterwards, the inspection team came to inspect, and the morale of the masses was even higher. After discussion by everyone, the task of the Seventh Workshop was increased by 50%. The workers of the Sixth Workshop proposed to complete the plan of February 10 before February 5. The workers made so many inventions and creations all of a sudden, and now no one is shouting that the task cannot be completed.

        A Pair of Brothers

We went to the 42nd work section and saw a silk banner with red characters hanging on the wall, which read: "Thank you for your strong support to the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League of our Second Branch Factory." While we were watching, we suddenly heard someone shouting: "Ambassador, you are back? Do you have any new tasks?" Ambassador? What ambassador? Looking back, we saw several people surrounding a person and asking questions. Who is this person? After asking, we learned that this person is Wang Changxi, the representative sent by the 42nd work section to the Second Branch Factory. The tooling of the Second Branch Factory is all made by the 42nd work section. The representative of the 42nd work section goes to the Second Branch Factory every day to attend production scheduling meetings to understand the production situation and problems there, so everyone gave him the nickname "Ambassador".

We found Comrade Wang Changxi. He said that the 42nd work section has been making tooling for the Second Factory. These two units are famous enemies. They quarrel all day long. The Second Factory asks all day long: "Why haven't you given us the tooling when it's due?" The 42nd work section also replied with "reason": "You ordered it late, and we can't prepare the materials in time." At that time, the plan of the Second Factory had to go through twelve hands and take more than two weeks to reach the hands of the workers of the 42nd work section.

"And now, the plan can reach our hands in just three days. A mold can usually be made in just one week." Wang Changxi said, now the 42nd work section has put forward such a slogan: "Satisfying the requirements of the Second Factory is our task." "We want to take the goods to the Second Factory on our own initiative." Whatever the Second Factory urgently needs, the 42nd work section will rush to do it. The 42nd work section has recently sent three comrades to be "stationed" in the Second Factory. When the tools in the workshop are broken, they will immediately repair them. The workers of the Second Factory are very satisfied. They have written many thank-you letters, and send a delegation to the 42nd work section every three or two days to express their appreciation. Everyone enthusiastically sings: "The 42nd work section and the Second Factory are brothers."

    革命干劲冲云霄
    本报记者
    锣鼓声敲得一阵比一阵响，会场怎么也静不下来。一直等到党委副书记要报告全厂1月份生产完成的情况了，这才好不容易静下来。
    党委副书记说：“我们华北无线电厂1959年一开始就打响了头一炮，1月上旬产值完成172％，中旬完成114.2％。有二十个车间应拿到跃进红旗，二分厂应得一面全面跃进红旗……”。
    掌声、笑声混成一片，人们兴奋地喊起了口号。这个车间的工人喊：“攻质量如猛虎，擒高产似蛟龙”，那个车间的工人叫：“我们的产品好又好，能上天来能入地，放射卫星进月宫，提高质量创奇迹”。
    人们跑到台上表决心，得了全面跃进红旗的二分厂的代表讲着讲着，情不自禁地念起了诗：“跃进红旗二厂飘，二厂绝对不骄傲。再接再厉再跃进，春节以前把喜报。”
          四天长四倍
    我们到二分厂走了一圈，见工人穿着白色工作服，戴着橡皮手套，坐在工作台前紧张地工作。车间的墙上贴着各式各样的图表和画，上面写着车间的计划、措施和关键项目。有的把解决关键项目的负责人和日期都详详细细地写出来。
    我们走到一个女工跟前，问起这个月的生产任务，她很有把握地说：“五万个”。说完以后，她很不好意思地说，二十多天前，她曾出过一次丑。四号那天，厂长来车间，问起了这个月的任务，一下子就把她给问住了。他恍恍惚惚记得有个“五”字，就信口说：“五十万个”。说了以后觉得不会那么多，马上又改口说：“五万个”。讲了又觉不对，只好老老实实说：“不知道”。说实在的，过年放了两天假，心老收不回来，另外自己还有一种思想，总认为厂里去年的生产搞得不错，一年长了十二倍，过了年该好好休息休息了，这样车间布置任务时就没用心听。
    没想到这情况引起了党委的重视，当天党委就开会研究，并且提出了新的行动口号：“狠狠抓生产，打响头一炮！”第二天，全厂就动起来了，厂里的宣传人员到处给人讲：“1959年是更大更好更全面跃进的一年，厂里的任务比头年多四倍多，大伙要加把劲。”
    车间的宣传员画了许多图表和画，把计划和措施贴在墙上，车间预先检查，大伙见面你考我我考你：车间、小组和你个人的月计划、周计划和日计划是多少？车间的关键是什么？怎样解决？
    八号，全厂组织了一个五百人的大检查团，生产上有关系的部门互相对口检查。前前后后查了三天，查人人是不是都知道车间的计划和关键？有没有解决关键的具体措施？查文明生产和生产秩序好不好？技术革命搞得怎么样？
    这一下，生产就翻了个过，只四天功夫产量就长了四倍。
          材料科轻松了
    我们去材料科参观。大伙一路走一路嘀咕，材料这么紧，科里的同志一定忙得不可开交，恐怕没时间和我们谈话。跑到办公室一看，奇怪，屋里静悄悄的，只有三个人在办公。计划调度组的组长李凤岩说，要是去年年底来材料科采访，那可真是找不出时间谈话。那时候，一天要有百十个人来催货，他们围坐在办公室里不走，个别的人嘴里还说些不三不四的话：“你们材料科是干什么的？生产任务完不成你们负不负责”；材料科的同志忙得一天连口水都喝不上，夜里想在办公室打个盹都不行，一会一个电话来催料。科里忙得没办法，只好把化验室、汽车队、仓库里能写能算的人都拉来帮忙，大伙连着几个通宵几个通宵的干，还是不顶事。
    怎么办？今年任务要长好几倍，材料从哪儿来？材料科的同志愁得没办法，找党委。党委为这事专门开了会，叫大伙好好发动群众，开源节流。不久，检查团下来检查了。李凤岩回述着当时的情景。他说，他被分派到三分厂去检查。下去，发现了好些问题，有的车间把计划订得过大，有的把大材当小材用，有的把贵材当贱材用，有个别车间有些料用不着，也不肯给人家。临走时，他们召集车间里的工人材料员开了个座谈会，会上，他们把材料紧张的情况讲了讲，要求大家想办法。
    从这以后，好消息就不断传来：十六车间没矽钢片，工人们就用小材、边料代替，没漆包线，就返修报废了的旧线。四分厂没料，工人们就把废模具拆了，把能用的零件拿下来用。工人们做的东西可多啦！他们做出了石碳酸、钢珠、电石和十几项高级合金。材料科不再觉得背上压得那么重了。
          首先要有干劲
    我们到制造机械和工模具的四分厂去。技术室的副主任苑光如说，大检查后，工人的干劲很足，他们发明创造了许多机器，像四车间车丝扣、螺纹，过去要七、八个钟头才能车一个，自改旋风切削加工法后，效率提高一百二十倍。六车间车汽缸，以前一天只能搞一、二个，最近改了工作法，一天能搞十几个。三车间把铣床单头刀改成双头刀，提高效率好几倍。工人王隆昌看了王崇伦发明创造的万能工具胎后改进了他的刨床，现在他的刨床不但可以刨平面，还可以代替插床刨各式各样的弧度……。我们走到六车间看见一大群人正在用钢丝捆扎一根粗管子和槽钢，有几个人正往木槽里灌水泥，同行的人告诉说，工人正用土法造六公尺龙门刨。做一台洋刨床，起码得半年功夫，而这个土的，只要一个月就可做成了。我们往前走了几步，又看见一个用铁板搭成的架子。人家说，这是工人做的二公尺五的土立车床。本来做这样一个车床要十几吨金属材料，现在用小料拼拼凑凑就做成了。
    苑光如介绍到这里，停了停说，现在回想起去年年底讨论计划时的情景，心里觉得实在好笑，那时间，大家张着两只手空嚷嚷：“1月份缺五十吨钢材，怎么造机器和工模具？”“我们应该用科学分析的精神来订计划呀！”弄得计划没法儿订。党委知道后，就叫大家好好学习讨论六中全会的文件，什么叫科学分析，科学分析是不是不要冲天干劲？困难是不是不能克服？紧接着检查团来检查，群众情绪更高了，七车间经过大伙讨论，任务增加了50％，六车间的工人提出要在2月5日前把2月10日的计划完成。工人一下子就搞了那么多发明创造，现在再没有人嚷嚷任务完不成了。
          一对亲兄弟
    我们到四二工段，见墙上挂着一幅白缎红字的锦旗，上面写着：“感谢你们大力支持咱二分厂党政工团”，正看着，忽然听见有人在喊：“大使，你回来了？有什么新的任务吗？”大使？什么大使？回头一看，见几个人正围着一个人问东问西，这人是谁？一打听，才知道这人叫王长喜，是四二工段派到二分厂的代表。二分厂的工模具都是四二工段做的。四二工段的代表天天去二厂开生产调度会，了解那边生产情况和问题，因此大伙就给他起了个名叫大使。
    我们找到王长喜同志，他说，四二工段一直给二厂作工模具，这两个单位是有名的冤家对头，一天到晚吵吵，二厂成天催问：“到期了为什么不给工模具？”四二工段回答得也挺有“道理”，你们订得迟，我们备料备不过来。那时候，二厂的计划转来转去要转十二道手，花两个多星期的功夫才能到四二工段工人的手里。
    “而现在，计划只要三天就可以到我们的手里。一副模一般只要一个星期就可以做出来。”王长喜说，现在四二工段提出这样一个口号：“满足二厂要求，就是我们的任务。”“我们要把货主动给二厂送上门。”二厂急需什么，四二工段就赶什么。四二工段最近还派了三位同志常“驻”在二厂，车间的工具坏了，马上就动手修。二厂工人非常满意，他们写来许多感谢信，三天两天就派慰问团来四二工段慰问一次，大伙热情地唱：“四二工段和二厂是亲兄弟”。
