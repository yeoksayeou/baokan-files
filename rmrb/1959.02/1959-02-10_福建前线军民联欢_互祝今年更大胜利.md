Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Frontline, February 9th: Xinhua News Agency frontline reporters reported on the scene of army and civilians on the Fujian front celebrating the Spring Festival, saying: Early in the morning of the 8th, the sound of firecrackers echoed from the fortress positions on the coastal defense line to the various mountain villages on the front. Loudspeakers on the wharves of the harbors broadcasted pleasant music, and teams of naval vessels that had patrolled the sea the previous night were returning from the ocean, flying the five-star red flag.
    As the morning sun rose from the sea, teams of national defense soldiers beat gongs and drums and went to the frontline people's communes to wish the commune members a happy new year. Girls and children in brightly colored clothes also went in groups to the front lines to visit the People's Liberation Army guarding the coastal defense front. Generals went to the companies and exchanged New Year's greetings with the soldiers. The leaders of the frontline navy also went to the ships and exchanged New Year's greetings with the sailors. During the mutual greetings, people joyfully shouted together: Wishing Chairman Mao good health! Wishing for greater victories in 1959!
    Frontline artillery soldiers extended New Year's greetings to the frontline people who persisted in the struggle against the enemy and in production and construction, and expressed their condolences to the families of martyrs, military dependents, and those who suffered under enemy fire. They also sent the frontline people many heartfelt New Year's gifts.
    On the Spring Festival day, the several clubs jointly run by the army and civilians on Dadeng Island were dressed in festive attire. The Party Committee secretaries of the Dadeng, Xiaodeng, and Jiaoyu three island battlefield people's communes and the leaders of the artillery units visited the soldiers and commune members throughout the three islands during the festival. The famous dancer Dai Ailian, who was visiting Dadeng Island, performed dances for the army and civilians during the festival.
    The leaders of the unit where the artillery soldier Hu Dean, who demonstrated a lofty communist style in the artillery battle, was stationed, specially expressed their gratitude on the Spring Festival day to the personnel of a certain hospital who had made great efforts to save Hu Dean's life, and to the Zhangzhou Prefectural Committee Secretary and the people who took the lead in donating blood to save Hu Dean.
    The "Ten Sisters," "Little Eighth Route Armies," and "Seven Aunts" of Hecuo Village, the heroic village on Xiamen Island, also carried large cabbages freshly pulled from the vegetable garden with a yield of over 28,000 catties per mu, and carried oysters, traversing the shell craters to reach the position of a certain artillery company. Lin Shaoyang, one of the "Seven Aunts" who returned from the Philippines, was over fifty years old. When she saw the artillery soldiers, she happily shouted in the Minnan dialect: "Liberation Army comrades, happy New Year!" Then she danced a Philippine folk dance in front of the artillery room for the artillery soldiers. The young "Ten Sisters" entered the artillery room and expertly operated the cannons in their respective positions, eliciting shouts of "Bravo!" from the artillery soldiers. They had served as artillerymen punishing the Jinmen Chiang troops.
    The sailors who returned from night patrol went to the home of the martyr sailor Wu Cailiang to inquire about his family. Martyr Wu Cailiang gave his young life in the battle to defend the motherland. The sailors and the Young Pioneers from Xiamen Siming Elementary School, who came to express their condolences, performed songs and dances at Wu's mother's home, wishing Wu's mother a happy Spring Festival.

    福建前线军民联欢
    互祝今年更大胜利
    新华社福建前线9日电　新华社前线记者报道福建前线军民欢度春节的情景说：8日一大早，从海防线上的要塞阵地到前线各个山庄上，到处响起了节日的鞭炮声。港湾码头上的扩音器，播送着悦耳的音乐，一队队在昨夜出海巡逻的海军艇队，正从远洋里扬着五星红旗返航归来。
    朝阳刚刚从海上升起，一队队的国防军战士打着锣鼓，来到前线人民公社给社员们贺年。穿着鲜艳花衣的姑娘、儿童们，也成群结队地赶到前沿去看望守卫在海防前线上的解放军。将军们到了连队，和战士们团拜。前线海军首长也到艇上和水兵们团拜。在互相团拜时，人们欢乐地共同高呼：祝毛主席健康！祝1959年更大的胜利！
    前线炮兵战士们纷纷向坚持对敌斗争、坚持生产建设的前线人民恭贺新春，向烈属、军属以及在敌人炮火下受难者的家属表示慰问。他们还送给前线人民许多情意深长的新春贺礼。
    春节这天，大登岛上军民合办的几个俱乐部都穿上了节日盛装。大登、小登和角屿三岛战地人民公社的党委书记与炮兵部队的首长，在节日里走遍了三岛，看望战士和社员。正在大登岛上进行访问的著名舞蹈家戴爱莲，节日为军民表演了舞蹈。
    在炮战中表现了崇高的共产主义风格的炮兵战士胡德安所在部队的首长，春节这天，特地向为抢救胡德安生命付出了巨大辛劳的某医院人员，向为抢救胡德安而带头献血的漳州地委书记以及人民，表示感谢。
    厦门岛上的英雄村——何厝村的“十姐妹”、“小八路”、“七大娘”还抬着从亩产二万八千多斤蔬菜园中刚拔起来的大白菜，挑着海蛎子，穿过弹坑奔向某炮连阵地。从菲律宾回国的“七大娘”中的林沙央，五十多岁了，见到炮兵就高兴地用闽南话喊道：“解放军同志，恭贺新喜！”接着就在炮室前给炮兵们跳起了菲律宾民间舞蹈。年轻的“十姐妹”走进炮室，便各就各位熟练地操作起大炮来，引得炮兵们同声叫“好！”她们曾作过惩罚金门蒋军的炮手。
    夜巡归来的水兵们，一上岸就奔到水兵吴才良烈士的妈妈家里去问长问短。吴才良烈士在保卫祖国的战斗中献出了年轻的生命。水兵们在吴妈妈家里和前来慰问的厦门市民立小学的少先队员们一起给吴妈妈表演歌舞，祝吴妈妈春节欢乐。
