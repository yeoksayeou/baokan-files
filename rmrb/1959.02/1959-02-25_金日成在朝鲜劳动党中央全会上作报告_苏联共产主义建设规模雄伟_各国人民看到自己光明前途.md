Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 23rd: The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party began here today.

    The agenda of the plenary session includes the following issues: 1. On the activities of the Korean Workers' Party delegation to the 21st Congress of the CPSU; 2. On improving the quality of industrial products; 3. On continuing to improve and develop transportation work.

    Kim Il-sung, head of the Korean Workers' Party delegation to the 21st Congress of the CPSU and Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, delivered a report on the first issue at the plenary session.

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 24th: Comrade Kim Il-sung, head of the Korean Workers' Party delegation to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, delivered a report on the 21st Congress of the CPSU at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party held on the 23rd.

    The report stated that the 21st Congress of the CPSU is a historical event of great significance not only for the communist construction of the Soviet people, but also for strengthening the unity and power of the socialist camp, for promoting the development of the international communist and working-class movement, and for safeguarding world lasting peace. Today, all members of the Korean Workers' Party and the Korean people, together with the progressive humanity of the world, warmly welcome the achievements of this congress and are greatly encouraged.

    The report stated that the 21st Congress of the CPSU was a congress of communist builders, and this congress showed that the Soviet people, under the leadership of Lenin's party, are advancing confidently towards the victory of communism. The report stated that the Soviet Union's seven-year plan is a magnificent program for building communism, and its enormous scale is unprecedented in history. This magnificent prospect further clearly demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system over capitalism and further strengthens the confidence of the people of the world in the final victory of socialism.

    The report stated that the 21st Congress of the CPSU demonstrated the victory of the Leninist line of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the unbreakable unity of the party ranks. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is creatively developing Marxism-Leninism, guiding the Soviet people to new victories.

    The report stated that the great achievements made by the Soviet people in recent years in the struggle for building communism and consolidating world peace have proved the enormous vitality of the line of the CPSU Central Committee and all the measures it has taken. This congress demonstrated the rock-solid unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, demonstrating that all the Soviet people are closely united around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union headed by Comrade Khrushchev, and expressing infinite love and trust in it.

    The report stated that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, founded by Lenin, is the center of the international communist and working-class movement and will always be an example for Marxist-Leninist parties throughout the world.

    The report stated that the 21st Congress of the CPSU demonstrated a new victory for Marxist-Leninist theory and made a great contribution to strengthening the socialist camp and developing the international communist movement. Comrade Khrushchev's report and the documents adopted by the congress not only clearly illuminated the prospects of Soviet communist construction and scientifically analyzed the important issues arising in the international workers' movement, but also further developed and enriched the Marxist-Leninist theory on the transition from socialism to communism. Today, the people of all countries in the socialist camp are infinitely encouraged by the growth of the Soviet Union's power, and they are victoriously building socialism in their own countries along the path opened up by the Soviet people and with its active support and assistance, and are advancing powerfully towards the bright future of communism. All Marxist-Leninist parties and hundreds of millions of working people around the world see their own bright future in the path of the Soviet people's advance and have gained infinite strength and courage.

    The report stated that it is extremely natural that all countries of the socialist camp are firmly united around the Soviet Union, and that all communist and workers' parties in the world are united around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This is also the sacred international obligation of all communists. The enemies of socialism fear this unity most.

    The report stated that in recent years, international reactionaries and revisionists have carried out various conspiracies to disintegrate the socialist camp from within and split the communist movement, but, as in the past, they have suffered a shameful defeat. Life has fully confirmed the correctness and vitality of the declaration of representatives of communist and workers' parties adopted at the Moscow meeting in November 1957. The report stated that revisionists have not been able to lead any communist and workers' party away from the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. Today, Yugoslav revisionists, like their predecessors Bernstein and Kautsky, have been branded as traitors and become objects of hatred for all communists and working people.

    The report stated that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and all the Korean people warmly support the Soviet Union's proposal to establish a zone of peace, primarily a non-nuclear zone, in the Far East and the Pacific region, and are making every effort to realize this proposal.

    The report stated that today the chieftain endangering peace in various regions of the world is the US imperialist. They maintain aggressive troops stationed in South Korea and Taiwan, expand military bases in Asia and other regions, and are continuing to create the danger of war.

    The report described the brilliant victories achieved by the Korean people in socialist construction. The report stated that we must continue to maintain a high speed and advance at a rapid pace. The most important task of our country's current socialist construction is to rely on the victorious socialist relations of production and the high revolutionary spirit of the working people to develop productive forces and further consolidate the socialist material and technical base.

    In discussing the peaceful reunification of Korea, the report said that we must not forget for a moment our compatriots in South Korea who are in a miserable situation under the rule of the US imperialists and the traitorous Syngman Rhee clique. We must resolutely persist in the struggle, force the US aggressors to withdraw from South Korea, and victoriously complete the peaceful reunification of our country.

    The report stated that the Korean people will firmly defend the eastern outpost of peace and socialism and fulfill their glorious internationalist obligations.

    The report stated that all the victories we have achieved are the victory of the policies formulated by the Korean Workers' Party based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and are the result of the heroic struggle of the Korean people united around the Party.

    The report stated that all our victories are inseparable from the active support of the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all fraternal countries. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is always our example, and its achievements and rich experience serve as a guide in our work. Comrade Khrushchev's report at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the various decisions of the Congress have become a new and tremendous help and encouragement to us. All members of the Korean Workers' Party and working people must study in depth Comrade Khrushchev's report and other documents of the Congress.

    The report stated that the Korean people have realized through their arduous struggle how precious friendship and solidarity with the people of socialist countries, especially friendship and solidarity with the Soviet people, are. The Korean Workers' Party and the Korean people will further strengthen friendship and solidarity with the Soviet people, continue to learn from them, and advance shoulder to shoulder with the people of all fraternal countries. We will strive to strengthen solidarity with all communist and workers' parties, as well as with the working people of the world.

    苏联共产主义建设规模雄伟
    各国人民看到自己光明前途
    新华社平壤23日电　朝鲜劳动党中央委员会全体会议今天在这里开始举行。
    全体会议的议程包括以下几个问题：一、关于出席苏共第二十一次代表大会的朝鲜劳动党代表团的活动的问题；二、提高工业产品质量的问题；三、继续改善和发展运输工作的问题。
    出席苏共第二十一次代表大会的朝鲜劳动党代表团团长、朝鲜劳动党中央委员会委员长金日成在全体会议上，就第一个问题作了报告。
    新华社平壤24日电　出席苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的朝鲜劳动党代表团团长金日成同志在朝鲜劳动党中央委员会23日举行的全体会议上，作了关于苏共第二十一次代表大会的报告。
    报告说，苏共第二十一次代表大会不仅对于苏联人民的共产主义建设、而且对于加强社会主义阵营的团结和威力、对于促进国际共产主义和工人阶级运动的发展、对于维护世界持久和平都是具有巨大意义的历史事件。今天，朝鲜劳动党全体党员和朝鲜人民同全世界进步人类一起，热烈欢迎这次大会所取得的成就，并且受到巨大的鼓舞。
    报告说，苏共第二十一次代表大会是共产主义建设者大会，这次大会显示了苏联人民正在列宁的党的领导下，满怀信心地向共产主义的胜利前进。报告说，苏联的七年计划是建设共产主义的宏伟纲领，它的庞大的规模是历史上从未有过的。这一雄伟的展望进一步清楚地显示了社会主义制度对资本主义的优越性，进一步加强了世界人民对社会主义取得最后胜利的信心。
    报告说，苏共第二十一次代表大会显示了苏联共产党中央委员会列宁路线的胜利和党的队伍的牢不可破的团结。苏联共产党创造性地发展着马克思—列宁主义，引导苏联人民不断走向新的胜利。
    报告说，近几年来，苏联人民在为建设共产主义和巩固世界和平的斗争中取得的伟大成就证明了苏共中央的路线和它采取的一切措施的巨大的生命力。这个大会显示了苏联共产党的坚如磐石的团结，显示出全体苏联人民紧密地团结在以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联共产党中央委员会的周围，并且对它表示无限的热爱和信任。
    报告说，由列宁建立的苏联共产党是国际共产主义和工人阶级运动的中心，并且永远是全世界马克思—列宁主义的政党的榜样。
    报告说，苏共第二十一次代表大会显示了马克思—列宁主义理论的新的胜利，对加强社会主义阵营、发展国际共产主义运动作出了伟大的贡献。赫鲁晓夫同志的报告和大会通过的文件不仅清楚地照亮了苏联共产主义建设的前景，科学地分析了国际工人运动中产生的重要问题，而且进一步发展和丰富了关于由社会主义过渡到共产主义的马克思—列宁主义的理论。今天社会主义阵营各国人民因苏联的威力的成长而受到无限鼓舞，他们沿着苏联人民所开辟的道路并且在它的积极的支持和援助下胜利地在自己的国家里建设社会主义，并且向着共产主义的光明的未来有力地前进着。全世界所有的马克思—列宁主义的政党和亿万劳动人民在苏联人民前进的道路上看到了自己的光明前途，并且得到了无限的力量和勇气。
    报告说，社会主义阵营的一切国家以苏联为中心牢固地团结着，全世界的共产党和工人党以苏联共产党为中心团结着，这是极其自然的事。这也是一切共产主义者的神圣的国际义务。社会主义的敌人最害怕这种团结。
    报告说，近几年来，国际反动派和修正主义者为了从内部瓦解社会主义阵营和分裂共产主义运动，进行了各种各样的阴谋活动，但是，它们像过去一样遭到了可耻的失败。生活完全证实了1957年11月在莫斯科召开的会议上通过的各国共产党和工人党代表的宣言的正确性和生命力。报告说，修正主义者没有能够使任何一个共产党和工人党离开马克思—列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的原则。今天，南斯拉夫修正主义者像他们的前辈伯恩斯坦和考茨基那样，被打上了变节者的烙印，成为所有共产主义者和劳动人民的憎恨的对象。
    报告说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和全体朝鲜人民热烈支持苏联关于在远东和太平洋地区建立和平地区、首先是非原子区的建议，并且为实现这个建议尽自己一切的努力。
    报告说，今天危及世界各地区和平的魁首是美帝国主义者。他们保持驻在南朝鲜和台湾的侵略军队，在亚洲和其他地区扩大军事基地，正在继续制造战争危险。
    报告叙述了朝鲜人民在社会主义建设中取得的光辉胜利。报告说，我们要快马加鞭，继续坚持高速度前进。我们国家目前的社会主义建设的最主要的任务是依靠胜利的社会主义生产关系和劳动人民的高度的革命精神，发展生产力和进一步巩固社会主义的物质技术基础。
    报告在谈到朝鲜的和平统一时说，我们一时一刻都不能忘记南朝鲜在美帝国主义者和李承晚卖国集团统治下处于悲惨境地的同胞们。我们必须顽强地坚持斗争，迫使美国侵略者撤出南朝鲜，胜利地完成我们国家的和平统一。
    报告说，朝鲜人民将坚强地捍卫和平和社会主义的东方前哨，完成自己担负的光荣的国际主义义务。
    报告说，我们所取得的一切胜利，是朝鲜劳动党根据马克思—列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的原则所制订的政策的胜利，是团结在党的周围的朝鲜人民进行英勇斗争的结果。
    报告说，我们的一切胜利是同苏联、中华人民共和国和一切兄弟国家人民的积极支援分不开的。苏联共产党永远是我们的榜样，它的成就和丰富的经验成为我们工作中的指针。赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会上作的报告和代表大会的各项决定，成为对我们的新的巨大的帮助和鼓励。朝鲜劳动党全体党员和劳动人民要深入学习赫鲁晓夫同志的报告和大会的其他文献。
    报告说，朝鲜人民通过自己的艰苦斗争认识到同社会主义各国人民的友谊团结，首先是同苏联人民的友谊团结，是多么宝贵。朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民将进一步加强同苏联人民的友谊团结，继续向他们学习，同一切兄弟国家人民并肩前进。我们将为加强同各国共产党和工人党的团结以及同全世界劳动人民的团结而努力。
