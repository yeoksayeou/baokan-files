    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 13th: The Polish working people are launching a widespread movement to greet the Third National Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, which will be held on March 10th this year, with practical actions.

    This movement began at the end of last year. The working people of all regions conducted nationwide discussions on the directives for Poland's development in the next seven years, which the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party will submit to the Third National Congress for discussion. Nearly 90% of the workers participated in the discussions. During the discussions, party activists and the broad masses of employees in industrial enterprises studied the production targets of their enterprises for 1959-1965 and explored the economic potential of their enterprises in order to raise production targets. For example, the workers of the "Seventh Zyrardów Factory" in Warsaw proposed during the discussion that they would produce 1,500 more cars than originally planned this year. The workers of the Dębica Rubber Factory proposed that they could save the 165 million złotys of investment that the state had planned to allocate to the factory during the period of 1960-1965, and guaranteed to complete the state's production tasks even without this investment. The shipbuilding workers of the "Paris Commune" Shipyard in Gdańsk decided to build eleven more ships than planned during the period of 1959-1965. Workers in the metallurgical industry planned to produce 9 million tons of steel for the country in 1965, while the original plan was 8.5 million tons.

    Farmers in various parts of Poland also widely discussed the issue of increasing crop yields. In Lublin Province alone, farmers held 400 meetings.

    While engaging in nationwide discussions, the working people of all regions undertook obligations to greet the Party Congress, and almost all industrial enterprises put forward guarantees for increasing production. For example, the "Jankowice" mine, by improving labor organization, can increase coal output by 150 tons per day and night. Workers in Rzeszów Province decided in January this year to produce products worth 500 million złotys more before the Party Congress is held. The Lenin Metallurgical Combine in Nowa Huta has already produced 8,500 tons of steel more than planned for the country, and the Oświęcim Chemical Combine has produced 20 million złotys worth of products more than planned. Due to the fulfillment of their guarantees, 1,200 enterprises in Wrocław Province have now produced 460 million złotys worth of products more for the country.

    In the movement to greet the Party Congress, Polish youth are standing at the forefront. 350,000 young people have guaranteed to produce products worth 500 million złotys more for the country.

    以实际行动迎接党的第三次代表大会
    波兰人民广泛展开增产运动
    各地对今后七年波兰发展的指示进行了全民讨论
    新华社华沙13日电　波兰劳动人民正在展开一个广泛的运动，以实际行动来迎接将在今年3月10日召开的波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会。
    这个运动在去年年底就展开了。各地的劳动人民对波兰统一工人党中央将提交第三次代表大会讨论的关于今后七年波兰发展的指示，进行了全民讨论。差不多有90％的工人参加了讨论。在讨论中，各地工业企业的党的积极分子、广大职工研究了1959—1965年本企业的生产指标，挖掘了本企业的经济潜力，以便提高生产指标。例如，华沙的“第七泽兰工厂”的职工在讨论中提出，要在今年超过原订计划多生产一千五百辆汽车，杰姆比查橡胶厂的职工提出，可以把国家预定要在1960—1965年期间拨给本厂的一亿六千五百万兹罗提的投资节省下来，而且保证在没有这笔投资的情况下仍旧完成国家的生产任务。革但斯克的“巴黎公社”造船厂的造船工人决定要在1959—1965年期间超计划多建造十一只船。冶金工业部门的工人计划在1965年给国家生产九百万吨钢，而原订计划是八百五十万吨。
    波兰各地农民也广泛讨论了提高农作物收获量的问题。单单在卢布林省，农民们就举行了四百次会议。
    在全民讨论的同时，各地劳动人民为迎接党的代表大会承担了义务，差不多所有的工业企业都提出了增加生产的保证。例如，“扬科维查”矿井由于改善了劳动组织，一昼夜可以把采煤量增加一百五十吨，热舒夫省工人在今年1月决定，要在党代表大会召开之前多生产价值达五亿兹罗提的产品。诺瓦胡塔的列宁冶金联合企业现在已经为国家超计划多生产了八千五百吨钢，奥斯威辛的化学联合企业多生产了二千万兹罗提的产品。弗罗茨瓦夫省的一千二百个企业由于完成了自己的保证，现在已经为国家多生产了四亿六千万兹罗提的产品。
    在迎接党代表大会的运动中，波兰青年们站在最前列。有三十五万青年保证要给国家多生产五亿兹罗提的产品。
