    The Great Friendship of Brotherhood of the Great People

    February 14th is a day of great significance in the history of the people of the Soviet Union and China. Nine years ago today, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China signed the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. This event was widely celebrated by the people of the Soviet Union, China, and all countries of the socialist camp.

    Humanity has never seen such a solid and sincere brotherly friendship, a friendship that will forever unite the great people of the Soviet Union and China. This brotherly alliance is the firm foundation of the unbreakable unity of the entire socialist family. The historically significant 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union demonstrated with new force the solidarity of the mighty socialist camp.

    In his report to the 21st Congress of the CPSU, Comrade N.S. Khrushchev emphasized the strong unity of the socialist camp and the unbreakable Soviet-Chinese friendship. He said: "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China are doing everything possible to strengthen the friendship between the two great socialist countries."

    The friendship and unbreakable unity of the Soviet Union and China are the great historical achievements of our two free people. Both the Soviet and Chinese people cherish this friendship and unity, and protect it as they would their own eyes.

    Speaking about the roots and foundations of Sino-Soviet friendship at the 21st Congress of the CPSU, Comrade Zhou Enlai said: "The Soviet Union and China are fraternal socialist countries. Marxism-Leninism closely unites our two countries and all socialist countries. The people of our two countries are the closest comrades-in-arms who have undergone long-term tests. Our destinies are common, our interests are consistent, and the close friendship between our two peoples will always be unbreakable."

    The celebration of the ninth anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance coincides with a new and decisive stage in the peaceful competition between the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the entire socialist camp with capitalism. Socialism has a decisive impact on the entire course of human history.

    As a result of the implementation of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, approved by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and due to the high-speed economic development of the people's democratic countries, the industrial products produced by the countries of the world socialist system will account for more than half of the world's total output. This will ensure that the world socialist system economically overwhelms the world capitalist system.

    Inspired by the resolutions of the Party's 21st Congress, the Soviet people are working actively to realize the Seven-Year Plan as soon as possible – a magnificent program for the comprehensive construction of communism. The working people of the People's Republic of China, as sincere friends of the Soviet people, welcomed the Soviet Seven-Year Plan with great enthusiasm and were sincerely happy for the labor achievements of the Soviet people. Zhang Guihai (音译), a worker in Beijing, expressed the thoughts and feelings of the Chinese people very well, saying: "The figures of the Seven-Year Plan excite us because the Soviet road is our road, and the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow."

    Under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party, the Chinese people are advancing confidently along the socialist road. Its economy and culture are developing at a high speed. In the past nine years – from 1950 to 1958 – China's industrial output has increased ninefold. In 1958 alone, industrial output increased by more than 60%, and agricultural output increased by more than doubled.

    The People's Republic of China, together with all socialist countries, is solving such an extremely important problem: to win as much time as possible in the economic competition with capitalism. It has set itself the task of surpassing Britain in industrial output in fifteen years. The nationwide "Great Leap Forward" movement shows that the Chinese people will complete this task in a much shorter time.

    The past nine years have convincingly demonstrated that Sino-Soviet friendship is of great significance for the people of our two countries to build socialism and communism, for consolidating and further developing the socialist system, and for the cause of peace and security for all mankind.

    The Soviet Union and China provide each other with constant assistance in their advancement. Cooperation between our two countries covers all aspects of life and is achieving increasingly remarkable results.

    Soviet-Chinese economic and cultural relations are an example of truly equal cooperation. The new agreement on further expanding economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, signed not long ago in Moscow by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Khrushchev and Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai, is also proof of this.

    The "Guangming Daily" wrote in an editorial that the Chinese people are satisfied and happy about the signing of the Sino-Soviet expanded economic cooperation agreement. With the sincere assistance of the great Soviet Union, our people will work harder to learn from the Soviet Union and strive for a great leap forward in our socialist construction.

    The working people of the People's Republic of China creatively apply the rich experience of Soviet socialist construction. The Soviet people are also absorbing many valuable things from the experience of our Chinese friends. The mutual enrichment of each other's experience is precisely the characteristic of the brotherly cooperation between our two countries.

    Sino-Soviet friendship has become a powerful factor in the struggle to consolidate peace and the security of all peoples. Even the most bellicose elements among the imperialists who advocate a new war have to admit this friendship and the great strength behind it.

    The people of our two countries hold the same views on all issues in international relations. The Soviet government and the Chinese government follow the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence between the capitalist system and the socialist system in their foreign policies. The peaceful policies of our two countries have been unanimously approved and supported by all progressive mankind. The strong alliance between the Soviet and Chinese people does not threaten anyone; this alliance serves the noble goal of defending the peaceful labor of our two peoples and ensuring lasting world peace.

    The imperialists and their echoers – the Yugoslav revisionists – are attempting to sow discord between the people of our two countries, between the two fraternal Communist Parties of the Soviet Union and China, and to find non-existent differences. This hope has already been dashed. As Comrade Khrushchev said at the 21st Congress of the CPSU, they will never see such differences, just as they will never see their own ears.

    The working people of the Soviet Union and China are moving firmly and confidently towards a bright future. In the struggle for this future, strong Marxist-Leninist parties have united them and are guiding them forward. The unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China, armed with the immortal Marxist-Leninist doctrine, is the guarantee of all the victories of our two peoples now and in the future.

    No force in the world can weaken and shake the unbreakable friendship forged by our two fraternal peoples under the victorious banner of Marxism-Leninism.

    苏联“真理报”二月十四日社论 
    伟大人民的兄弟友谊
    2月14日是苏联和中国两国人民历史上有着重大意义的日子。九年前的今天，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和中华人民共和国签订了友好同盟互助条约。这件事受到苏联、中国以及整个社会主义阵营各国人民的广泛的庆贺。
    人类从来未曾有过这样巩固的真诚的兄弟友谊，这种友谊永远把苏中两国伟大的人民团结在一起。这种兄弟联盟是整个社会主义国家大家庭牢不可破的团结一致的坚固基础。具有历史意义的苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会以新的力量显示出强大的社会主义阵营的团结一致。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在苏共第二十一次代表大会上作的报告中强调指出社会主义阵营强有力的团结一致和中苏友谊的牢不可破。他说：“苏联共产党和中国共产党竭尽全力来加强两个伟大的社会主义国家的友谊”。
    苏联和中国的友谊和牢不可破的团结一致是我们两国自由的人民具有历史意义的伟大成果。苏联人和中国人都珍视这种友谊和团结，像爱护眼珠一样来爱护它。
    周恩来同志在苏共第二十一次代表大会上谈到中苏友谊的根源和基础时说：“苏联和中国是社会主义的兄弟之邦。马克思列宁主义把我们两国和所有社会主义国家紧密地团结在一起。我们两国人民是经过长期考验的最亲密的战友。我们的命运是共同的，我们的利害是一致的，我们两国人民的亲密友谊永远是牢不可破的。”
    庆祝苏中友好同盟互助条约的九周年，正好是苏联、中华人民共和国以及整个社会主义阵营在同资本主义进行和平竞赛方面进入一个新的决定性的阶段的时候。社会主义对整个人类历史进程起着决定性的影响。
    由于执行苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会所批准的苏联发展国民经济七年计划，以及由于各人民民主国家经济的高速度发展，世界社会主义体系各国生产的工业品将占全世界产量的一半以上。这样将保证世界社会主义体系在经济上压倒世界资本主义体系的优势。
    被党的第二十一次代表大会的决议所鼓舞的苏联人民，为尽快实现七年计划——全面展开共产主义建设的宏伟纲领，而积极努力地劳动。作为苏联人民的真诚朋友的中华人民共和国的劳动人民，以巨大的热情欢迎苏联的七年计划，并且衷心地为苏联人民的劳动成果而高兴。北京工人张贵海（音译）很好地表达了中国人民的思想感情，他说：“七年计划的数字激动着我们，这是因为苏联的道路就是我们的道路，苏联的今天就是我们的明天”。
    中国人民在光荣的共产党的领导下满怀信心地沿着社会主义道路前进。它的经济和文化正在高速度地发展着。在过去九年——从1950年到1958年——中，中国的工业产量增加了九倍。仅仅在1958年一年中，工业产量就增加了60％以上，农业产量增加了一倍以上。
    中华人民共和国同所有社会主义国家一道在解决这样一个极其重要的问题：在同资本主义的经济竞赛中最大限度地赢得时间。它给自己提出了一项任务，要在十五年内在工业产量方面超过英国。全国展开的“大跃进”运动表明，中国人民将在短得多的时间内完成这个任务。
    过去的九年令人信服地表明，苏中友好对于我们两国人民建设社会主义和共产主义，对于巩固和进一步发展社会主义制度，对于全人类和平和安全的事业具有巨大的意义。
    苏联和中国在前进中互相给予经常的援助。我们两国的合作包括生活的各个方面，并且获得越来越显著的成果。
    苏联和中国的经济关系和文化关系是真正平等合作的范例。不久前苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来在莫斯科签订的进一步扩大苏联和中华人民共和国经济合作的新协定也证明了这一点。
    “光明日报”在社论中写道，中国人民对于中苏扩大经济合作协定的签订，感到满意和高兴。在伟大苏联的真诚援助下，我国人民将更加努力向苏联学习，争取我国社会主义建设的大跃进。
    中华人民共和国的劳动人民创造性地运用苏联社会主义建设的丰富经验。苏联人也在吸取着我们中国朋友经验中的许多宝贵的东西。相互丰富彼此的经验正是我们两国兄弟般合作的特点。
    苏中友谊已经成为巩固和平和各国人民安全的斗争中的强大因素。甚至连拥护新战争的帝国主义者中最好战的分子也不得不承认这种友谊及其背后的伟大力量。
    我们两国人民对于国际关系中一切问题的观点都是一致的，苏联政府和中国政府在自己的外交政策中遵循着资本主义体系同社会主义体系和平共处的列宁主义原则。我们两国的和平政策受到了全体进步人类的一致赞同和支持。苏联人民和中国人民的强大同盟不威胁任何人，这个同盟是为保卫我们两国人民和平劳动的崇高目标、为保障世界持久和平服务的。
    帝国主义者及其应声虫——南斯拉夫修正主义者企图在我们两国人民之间、在苏联和中国两个兄弟共产党之间散布不和，寻找并不存在的分歧，这种希望是已经落空了。正如赫鲁晓夫同志在苏共第二十一次代表大会上所说的，他们永远看不到这种分歧，就像永远看不见自己的耳朵一样。
    苏联和中国的劳动人民正在坚定地、满怀信心地走向光明的未来。在争取这个未来的斗争中，强大的马克思列宁主义政党把他们团结了起来并引导着他们前进。以不朽的马克思列宁学说武装起来的苏联共产党和中国共产党的团结一致，是我们两国人民现在和未来一切胜利的保证。
    世界上没有任何力量能够削弱和动摇我们两国兄弟人民在马克思列宁主义胜利旗帜下所结成的牢不可破的友谊。
