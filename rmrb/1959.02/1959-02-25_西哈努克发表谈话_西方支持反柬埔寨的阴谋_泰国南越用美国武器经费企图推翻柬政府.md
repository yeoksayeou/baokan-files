Xinhua News Agency, February 24th, dispatch from London, TASS, February 23rd: Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Sihanouk, in an interview with a Singapore-based reporter for the London "Observer," condemned the United States for supporting a conspiracy to overthrow the current Cambodian government. The reporter wrote that Sihanouk said that Thailand and South Vietnam are using American weapons and funds to realize this conspiracy.

According to the reporter, Prince Sihanouk was referring to the recently exposed conspiracy led by Cambodian right-wing political activist Sam Sary. The "Observer" reporter wrote that, according to government materials, the Cambodian rebels' army is being prepared on South Vietnamese territory and possesses a large quantity of weapons.

Prince Sihanouk continued, "It seems that the arrest of a large number of conspirators, our acquisition of destructive documents and confessions, and the prevention of the conspirators' activities in Saigon and Bangkok have stopped their plans. But they still insist on their plan to establish a new, rebellious government."

Prince Sihanouk added: "It is regrettable that our neighbors are using the funds and weapons of the Western bloc to threaten our country and plot conspiracies against our country." The reporter pointed out that there is no doubt that Prince Sihanouk was referring to the United States when he spoke of Western countries. The reporter then wrote that Prince Sihanouk's close aides believe that behind the aforementioned conspiracy lies a plan to establish a pro-Western republic in Cambodia, similar to South Vietnam.

    新华社24日讯　塔斯社伦敦23日讯：柬埔寨首相西哈努克亲王对伦敦“观察家报”驻新加坡记者发表谈话时，谴责美国支持企图推翻柬埔寨现政府的阴谋。记者写道，西哈努克说，泰国和南越正利用美国的武器和经费来实现这种阴谋。
    据记者说，西哈努克亲王所指的是不久前被揭露的由柬埔寨右翼政治活动家桑·萨里领导的阴谋。“观察家报”记者写道，根据政府材料，柬埔寨的叛乱者的军队在南越领土上整装待发，并且备有大量武器。
    西哈努克亲王接着说，“看来，逮捕了大量阴谋者，我们获得了破坏性文件和口供，阻止了阴谋策划者在西贡和曼谷的活动。但是他们仍然坚持他们的建立新的、叛乱政府的计划。”
    西哈努克亲王补充说：“令人遗憾的是，我们邻国正利用西方集团的经费和武器来威胁我国和策划反对我国的阴谋”。记者指出，毫无疑问，西哈努克亲王谈到西方国家时，指的是美国。记者接着写道，西哈努克亲王的亲信人士认为，在上述阴谋的背后，有一个在柬埔寨建立类似南越那样的亲西方共和国的计划。
