Expanded Utilization of Fission and Fission Products

    Fission is the flame of the atomic age, and it will replace the burning of coal and oil, giving us light and heat.

    Fission is caused by neutrons, which are very small uncharged particles, only slightly heavier than the hydrogen nucleus (also called a proton). Together with protons, they constitute all atomic nuclei, so they are called nucleons. When a neutron is very close to the nucleus of uranium-235 (usually, the number after an element indicates roughly how many times heavier its nucleus is than the hydrogen nucleus; uranium-235 means a uranium nucleus about 235 times heavier than the hydrogen nucleus), it will be absorbed by the uranium nucleus. As a result, the uranium nucleus will split into two lighter nuclei (occasionally it will split into three or four fragments, a phenomenon discovered by Chinese scientists Qian Sanqiang and He Zehui under the guidance of Joliot-Curie), and release two to three new neutrons. This is called fission. And materials like uranium-235 that can undergo fission are called fissile materials, their common name being nuclear fuel.

    From this, it can be seen that neutrons play an important role. They are relied upon to create new fissile materials, and they are also relied upon to cause fission. At the same time, the importance of uranium-235 can also be seen, because its fission can continuously provide neutrons, especially because the neutrons produced after its fission are more than one, making it possible to cause more than one new fission. This new fission then causes newer fission, allowing the fission energy to continue on its own. Such a reaction is called a chain reaction. When the volume of a uranium block or a solution of uranium salt is quite small, neutrons can easily escape from it, so a chain reaction cannot occur. When they have a large enough volume, plus some moderators to reduce the speed of the neutrons, and a reflective layer to reflect the escaped neutrons back, the chain reaction of fission can occur in the uranium block and the uranium salt solution. Such a uranium block or uranium salt solution is called an atomic reactor. It can continuously provide heat energy like a boiler, so it has a common name, called an atomic boiler.

    If the number of neutrons in an atomic reactor keeps increasing, then the fission reaction will become more and more intense; if the number of neutrons keeps decreasing, then the fission reaction will slow down, or even stop. Therefore, people compare the neutrons in fission to oxygen in combustion, and the amount of neutrons in an atomic boiler is equivalent to the amount of ventilation in an ordinary boiler. To control an atomic boiler, you only need to control the number of neutrons.

    The slag in an ordinary boiler obstructs ventilation and reduces the furnace temperature, while the fission fragments in an atomic boiler (which can be said to be the "slag" or "ashes" in the atomic boiler) also absorb neutrons, weakening the fission reaction. Therefore, before the uranium-235 in the boiler is completely fissioned, the atomic fuel must be taken out of the furnace, the uranium extracted and returned to the furnace by chemical analysis, and the fission fragments taken out for separate treatment. The uranium-235 burned in an atomic boiler almost entirely becomes fission fragments, and the current consumption of uranium-235 is still quite large.

    Among the fission products, in addition to fission fragments, there are also neptunium-239, plutonium-239, and elements heavier than plutonium, which are transformed from uranium-238. These elements are all heavier than uranium, so they are also called transuranic elements. These fission products can be said to be new substances of the atomic age. Before there were atomic reactors, these new substances were almost impossible to find on Earth. For example, iodine, strontium, and barium are also present in the Earth's crust and oceans, but they are very stable, while the iodine, strontium, and barium in reactors are unstable. Another example is technetium, which has a very short life, and in the past was only found in the sun and other stars, not in the Earth's crust. Now it has been found in reactors, and in considerable quantities. As for transuranic elements such as plutonium and neptunium, they are also almost impossible to find in nature.

    We not only do not know the uses of these new substances, but even scientists working on atomic energy have not yet utilized them all. At present, some products have found uses, such as cesium-137, which has a longer life and can replace X-ray sources to inspect internal defects in metal sheets; strontium-90 can make air conductive, thus eliminating the static electricity accumulation caused by friction in light industrial products, and can also be combined with semiconductor materials to manufacture atomic batteries that can be used for decades, etc.; iodine-131, which has a shorter life, can be used as a tracer atom to diagnose thyroid diseases. However, many radioactive isotopes do not yet have any known uses, and they are all unstable; if they are not used, they will change, and they cannot be stored, so they can only be treated as waste. Even a large part of radioactive strontium and cesium is treated as waste. Because these substances constantly emit rays that are harmful to human and biological life, they are dangerous and troublesome waste. At the 1955 Geneva Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, the disposal of radioactive waste was regarded as a difficult and complex problem. Currently, Britain uses pipelines to discharge radioactive waste into the seabed. Soviet scientists believe that this is not safe. Although these wastes cannot raise the radioactivity in seawater to a level harmful to human health, they may concentrate certain radioactive properties in the bones of fish, becoming a disaster for humans. Due to the rapid development of the atomic energy industry, there will be more and more radioactive fission products. If they are not all utilized, it will not only be a great pity, but it will also cause difficulties in disposal.

    The expanded utilization of fission products mentioned by Khrushchev in his report to the 21st Congress of the CPSU refers to the need to apply these radioactive isotopes to production as much as possible. If this requirement is met, it will not only promote various production undertakings, but also turn the useless into useful, directly reducing the cost of atomic power generation.

    In addition, the neutrons emitted during uranium fission can also be used to produce radioactive isotopes. A large part of radioactive isotopes are made using neutrons. For example, cobalt-60, which is used to treat tumors, is transformed after cobalt-59 absorbs neutrons; carbon-14 and phosphorus-32, which are used to study the internal tissues of plant and animal growth, and iron-59, which is used to study the steel smelting process, etc., all need to be made using neutrons. Neutrons can also be used to transform thorium-232 into uranium-233, and heavy hydrogen into super-heavy hydrogen, all of which are nuclear fuels. Neutrons can also be used for various scientific research, such as studying the changes in the properties of materials under the action of neutrons, etc. Therefore, if neutrons are also included in the scope of fission products, then the uses of fission products will be even greater.

    裂变和裂变产物的扩大利用
    克理
    裂变，这是原子时代的火焰，它将代替煤和石油的燃烧，给我们光和热。
    裂变是由中子引起的，中子是不带电的很小的粒子，它只比氢核（也叫做质子）略微重一点，它和质子一起构成了一切原子核，因此人们把它们叫做核子。当中子很接近铀235的原子核时（通常一个元素后面的数字，表示它的核的重量大致是氢核的多少倍，铀235就是指比氢核约重235倍的铀核）就会被铀核吸住，从而铀核就由中子的冲击裂成两个较轻的原子核（偶然也会裂成三块到四块碎片，这个现象是我国科学家钱三强和何泽慧在约里奥·居里指导下发现的），并放出二个到三个新的中子。这叫做裂变。而铀235这样能够裂变的物质，叫做可裂变物质，它们的通俗名称，就是核子燃料。
    从这里可以看出，中子起了重要的作用，制造新的可裂变物质时要靠它，引起裂变也要靠它。同时，也能看出铀235的重要，因为它的裂变，可以源源不断地提供中子，特别是由于它裂变后产生的中子不止一个，有可能引起一个以上的新的裂变，这个新的裂变又引起更新的裂变，使裂变能自行继续下去。这样的反应叫做链式反应。铀块或铀盐的溶液的体积相当小的时候，中子很容易从里面逃走，因此就不能产生链式反应；当它们有足够大的体积，再加上一些减速剂，减低中子的速度，加一层反射层，把跑出来的中子反射回去，就可以使铀块和铀盐溶液进行裂变的链式反应。这样的铀块或铀盐溶液，叫做原子反应堆。它能够像锅炉那样，不断提供热能，因此它有一个通俗名称，叫做原子锅炉。
    原子反应堆里中子的数量，如果不断增加，那么裂变反应就愈来愈猛烈；如果中子数量愈来愈少，那么裂变反应就要减慢，甚至停止。所以人们把裂变作用中的中子比作燃烧作用中的氧气，而原子锅炉里的中子量就相当于普通锅炉里的通风量。要控制原子锅炉，只要控制中子数量就行了。
    普通锅炉里的炉渣要阻碍通风，减低炉温，而原子锅炉里的裂变碎片（可以说是原子锅炉里的“炉渣”或“灰烬”）也要吸收中子，使裂变反应减弱。因此，等不到锅炉里的铀235裂变完，就要从炉中取出这些原子燃料，用化学分析，把铀取出回炉，并把裂变碎片取出另行处理。原子锅炉中烧掉的铀235几乎全变成了裂变碎片，而目前铀235的消耗量还是相当大的。
    裂变产物中，除了裂变碎片以外，还有由铀238变成的镎239、钚239和比钚还重的元素。这些元素都比铀重，因此也叫做超铀元素。这些裂变产物，可说是原子时代的新物质。在没有原子反应堆以前，这些新物质在地球上几乎找不到。又如碘、锶、钡这几种元素，在地壳和海洋中虽然也存在，但它们都很稳定，而反应堆中的碘、锶、钡却是不稳定的。再如锝这种元素，由于寿命很短，过去只在太阳和其他恒星中才有，地壳中根本找不到，现在从反应堆中找到了，而且有相当数量。至于钚、镎这些超铀元素，在自然界中也几乎找不到。
    对于这些新物质，不仅我们不知道它们的用途，连从事原子能工作的科学家，也还没有把它们都利用起来。目前有些产物已经找到了用途，如寿命较长的铯137，可以代替X射线源，来探视金属薄片内部的缺陷；锶90可以使空气导电，因而可以消除轻工业产品由于摩擦而引起的静电积累，也可以和半导体物质配合，制造能使用几十年的原子电池等；寿命较短的碘131可以用作示踪原子，用来诊断甲状腺病。但很多放射性同位素，还不知道有什么用，而且它们都是不稳定的，不用就变了，想藏也藏不住，因此只好当废料处理。甚至连放射性锶和铯的很大部分也当作废料处理。由于这些物质不断地放出有害于人和生物生命的射线，因此是危险和麻烦的废料。在1955年日内瓦和平利用原子能会议上，把排除放射性废物看成是艰巨而又复杂的问题。目前，英国利用管道把放射性废物排入海底。苏联科学家认为这样做是不安全的，这些废物虽然不能把海水中的放射性提高到有害人们健康的程度，但可能把某些放射性质浓集到鱼的骨头中，而成为人的祸害。由于原子能事业的迅速发展，放射性裂变产物将愈来愈多，如果不将它们全部利用起来，不仅非常可惜，而且将会造成处理上的困难。
    赫鲁晓夫在苏共二十一次代表大会的报告中所指出的扩大裂变产物的利用，指的就是应当尽量把这些放射性同位素应用到生产中去。如果达到了这个要求，不仅推动了各项生产事业，也可化无用为有用，直接减低了原子能发电的成本。
    此外，铀裂变时发出的中子，也可以被用来制造放射性同位素。有很大一部分放射性同位素，都是利用中子制成的。例如治疗肿瘤的钴60，就用钴59吸收中子后变成；研究动植物生长内部组织的碳14、磷32，以及研究钢铁冶炼过程的铁59等等，也都要利用中子制成。还可以利用中子使钍232变成铀233，使重氢变成超重氢，它们都是核子燃料。利用中子还可以进行各种科学研究，如研究中子作用下物质性质的改变等等。因此，把中子也放在裂变产物的范围内，那么裂变产物的用途就更多了。
