Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 2nd. The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued its session at 4:00 PM (Moscow time) on February 2nd to discuss Comrade Khrushchev's report.

At the afternoon session, V. Grishin, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, spoke first. He pointed out that the 21st Congress of the CPSU was attracting the attention of world public opinion because the congress would resolve the issues of the further development of the Soviet Union, humanity, and the world.

After describing the enthusiastic welcome of the Soviet people to the CPSU Congress, Grishin said that at the time of the convening of the congress, the Soviet trade unions, with more than 52 million members, were more firmly and unitedly prepared to fulfill the tasks put forward by the Seven-Year Plan to the Soviet working people.

Grishin pointed out the development and growth of regular production meetings organized by trade unions in enterprises and construction sites. He said that more than seven million employees were elected into these meetings, through which the working people could directly manage factories and construction sites.

Grishin said that in the future, the Soviet trade unions would first assist in launching the patriotic movement of the working people domestically, striving to complete the Seven-Year Plan in five or six years.

Zasyadko, Vice Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, said in his speech that the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan made every participant in the congress deeply proud of the Communist Party and the Soviet people, because the Party and the people jointly shouldered the task of turning our country into the most powerful country in the world. The task of catching up with and then surpassing the most developed capitalist countries, including the United States, in terms of industrial product production, would be solved by developing the entire economy on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry. The victory of the Soviet people was beyond doubt.

Zasyadko pointed out the magnificent scale of capital construction stipulated in the control figures. The investment in capital construction in the Seven-Year Plan was equal to the sum of all investments since the establishment of the Soviet regime.

Zasyadko emphasized that the primary issue at present was the issue of effectiveness and the correct use of investment. In his speech, he severely criticized the leadership of the former Soviet State Planning Committee. Due to the mistakes of this leadership, large amounts of funds had been frozen in the past, funds had been scattered, and many projects could not be completed, and the excessive delay of project deadlines had not been stopped.

The next speaker was Titov, First Secretary of the Kharkov Oblast Committee, who spoke about the achievements of this major industrial area of Ukraine in the past three years, as well as its tasks in the next seven years.

Razzakov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kyrgyzstan, emphasized in his speech that the Seven-Year Plan correctly combined the interests of the entire Soviet Union and the interests of the various republics.

Razzakov suggested including the development of the large coal mining area in Kyrgyzstan and the construction of the Frunze-Chu River railway (which connects the republic with several major railway lines in the Soviet Union) in the Seven-Year Plan.

Käbin, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Estonia, said in his speech that before joining the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Estonia was only an agricultural raw material byproduct of capitalist countries. Now Estonia is an industrial-agricultural socialist republic, and its industrial output is now 8.6 times higher than in 1940 before the war, despite the large-scale destruction it suffered during World War II.

Ignatiev, First Secretary of the Tatar Oblast Committee of the CPSU, pointed out, when talking about the development of the national economy of the formerly backward Tatar, that the total output value of Tatar in 1958 increased by 140 times compared to 1913.

Ignatiev said that by the time the Seven-Year Plan is completed, Tatar's total industrial output will increase by 84% compared to 1958. During the seven years, Tatar's oil industry will drill 5,000 oil wells. The republic's proportion in the country's fuel structure will be further increased.

At the afternoon session, the following delivered congratulatory speeches to the congress: Rabah Bouhali, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Algerian Communist Party, Ali Yata, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Moroccan Communist Party, Alvarez, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Argentine Communist Party, and Arismendi, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uruguay. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by the attendees.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 3rd. At 10:00 AM (Moscow time) today, the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued to meet in the Grand Kremlin Palace to discuss Khrushchev's report.

Marshal Malinovsky, Soviet Minister of Defense, spoke first.

V. Kozlov, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, said in his speech that the Soviet state had firmly moved forward in all aspects of construction during the period from the 20th Congress to the 21st Congress of the CPSU. The Soviet people have every right to be proud of the victories they have achieved. The Seven-Year Plan for comprehensively launching the construction of a communist society has unfolded a broader prospect in front of the Soviet state. He said that it is not surprising that all working people in the Soviet Union and around the world are paying close attention to the congress that is discussing the plan to give new vigorous development to our country's productive forces. Everyone sees the achievements of the Soviet Union as a victory for our system, which has proven in fact that socialism is superior to capitalism.

Kozlov said that we firmly oppose war, and we advocate eliminating the tense atmosphere in international relations. In order to complete its plan, the Soviet people need peace. Peace is the basic content of Leninism’s foreign policy.

The speaker then said that the Soviet Union is not alone in its rapid progress towards progress. People's China and other countries in the socialist camp are with it. The world socialist system is a powerful force. The sycophants of imperialism—reformists and revisionists—want to create divisions within the peace camp, and their pathetic attempts will not succeed.

Kozlov said that the completion of the Seven-Year Plan will be a decisive factor in establishing the material and technical foundation of communism. Therefore, the further technological development of the national economy, the transformation and modernization of existing enterprises are of great significance. More than half of the planned increase in labor productivity in industry will rely on mechanization and automation to be realized. Kozlov emphasized that a real technological revolution will also be carried out in some departments.

Belyauskas, Alternate Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU, spoke at the meeting. He said that the significance of the 21st Congress to the Soviet Union and the entire international life is inestimable. The measures implemented by the Party in recent years to reorganize the management of industry and construction, strengthen the collective farm system, and expand the powers of local and republic institutions have promoted the achievement of economic achievements and enhanced the enthusiasm of all the Soviet people.

Belyauskas then said that when the Party and the people were struggling to implement important measures, the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov embarked on the path of factional activities, attempting to obstruct the implementation of the resolutions of the 20th Congress.

Belyauskas said, I cannot but admit with pain that I did not recognize the anti-Party conspiracy of this group at the important moment of the Party. I stated this in front of the congress of the highest organ of our Party. I condemned in the past, and I condemn now, the divisive activities of the anti-Party group. I talked about this at the June Plenum of the Central Committee, and I have also spoken on this issue at various Party meetings.

Belyauskas expressed complete agreement with Khrushchev's assessment of the activities of the anti-Party group in the report to the congress and at the December Plenum of the Central Committee.

Belyauskas explained to the congress how he went down the wrong path. He said that although he expressed doubts about the reorganization of the management of industry and construction in those years, and supported attacks on Khrushchev, he did not agree with the anti-Party group's proposal to remove the leadership of the Central Committee.

Belyauskas said that he agreed with the Central Committee on the issue of the need to reclaim wasteland and on international life issues such as relations with Yugoslavia.

Belyauskas said that during his tenure as ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, he increasingly realized what harm the anti-Party sectarian group brought to the Soviet Union's policies.

In his speech, Belyauskas once again emphasized that he, like the entire Party and the Soviet people, believed that all the measures implemented by the Party Central Committee in recent years were absolutely correct. He thanked the Central Committee for giving him the opportunity to redeem his mistakes to the Party, and said that he would strive not to fail the trust that the Party now gives him. He said that he guarantees to always defend the cause of the Party, to fight for the realization of the Party's general line, for the cause of peace, and for communism.

V. Yelyutin, Soviet Minister of Higher Education, said that the professors, teachers, and university students of Soviet higher education institutions welcomed with incomparable joy the plan for building communism that the congress was discussing—the Seven-Year Plan.

Yelyutin said that well-trained cadres would play a huge role in solving the tasks facing the Soviet Union. The Communist Party has always paid great attention to the training of cadres and has achieved great success in this regard. In the Soviet Union, intellectuals from worker and peasant backgrounds have grown up. Yelyutin talked about the increasing speed of cadre training and compared it with other countries.

In his speech, Yelyutin talked about the further development of scientific research and higher education institutions. He talked about the broad possibilities created by the Soviet Union for the creative labor of scientists, and about the increasingly close connection between science and the national economy.

Yelyutin emphasized that educating young people in the spirit of communism is of great significance to the construction of communism. The implementation of the decisions of the Party and the government on the combination of education and productive labor will promote this.

Kuusinen, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU, said that the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan and subsequent long-term plans propose the historic task of achieving the complete economic victory of the socialist system over the capitalist system.

Kuusinen pointed out that the Seven-Year Plan and the long-term plans, in political terms, will correctly send our country into the orbit of communism like a multi-stage rocket.

Kuusinen emphasized the importance of the theoretical principles elaborated in Khrushchev's report. He said that our Party has long needed a new program, and a draft of this program should be prepared before the next congress of the CPSU. This task is realistic because we now have every reason to use the Seven-Year Plan and the long-term plans as the foundation of the program. Kuusinen said that if Khrushchev's report is used as the basis for the CPSU party program, then a good party program will be obtained.

Kuusinen condemned the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov. He said that the daily practice of this group is in fact a revision of Marxism-Leninism. These rigid bureaucrats felt incompatible with everything new. They felt that if the Party and the people started to complete new tasks, they would not be able to maintain their leading positions. I believe that no one at our congress would not condemn the participants of the anti-Party group.

Kuusinen then pointed out the importance of strengthening internationalist ties and uniting the forces of the international communist movement and the workers' movement. He emphasized that the 21st Congress itself is a brilliant proof of the unity of these forces, which is also reflected in the speeches of the representatives of brother parties from all over the world at the congress.

Ulbabayev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Tajikistan, said that the brilliant achievements made by the Soviet people in welcoming the 21st Congress and the unanimous support of the Soviet people for the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan are a severe judgment on the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov. This group has broken away from the Party and does not believe in the creative power of the people. The explanations given by the participants of this group are not satisfactory. He believes that it may not be appropriate to continue to keep the participants of the factional group in the Party Central Committee.

The next speaker was Ivan Dyadyk, Chairman of the National Economic Council of the Stalino Economic Region (Ukraine).

The last speaker at the morning session was the famous physicist Academician Igor Kurchatov.

Kurchatov said that, as pointed out in Khrushchev's report, our scientists will engage in mastering controllable thermonuclear reactions in order to obtain virtually endless energy sources.

He said that this task is not a problem today, because the Soviet Union now has enough necessary fuel resources for many years. The task is raised out of concern for the future of mankind and for communist society. (Attached picture)

    七年计划和远景计划有如多级火箭
    将正确地把苏联送进共产主义轨道
    科兹洛夫和库西宁等在苏共代表大会上发言
    新华社莫斯科2日电  苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会2日下午四时（莫斯科时间）继续开会，讨论赫鲁晓夫同志的报告。
    在下午会议上，全苏工会中央理事会主席维·格里申第一个发言。他指出，苏共第二十一次代表大会吸引着世界公众的注意，因为在代表大会上将解决苏联、人类和全世界进一步发展的问题。
    格里申叙述了苏联人民热情迎接苏联共产党代表大会的情况后说，在召开这次代表大会的时候，拥有五千二百万会员以上的苏联工会，更加坚强、团结一致地准备完成七年计划向苏联劳动人民所提出的任务。
    格里申指出了企业和工地的工会所组织的经常性的生产会议的发展和成长。他说，有七百万名以上的职工被选入这种会议，通过这种会议，劳动人民可以直接管理工厂和工地。
    格里申说，今后苏联工会将首先协助在国内开展劳动人民的爱国主义运动，争取在五、六年内完成七年计划。
    苏联部长会议副主席扎夏迪科在发言中说，七年计划控制数字使代表大会的每一个参加者都为共产党和苏联人民而深深感到骄傲，因为党和人民共同肩负着把我国变为世界最强大的国家的任务。在工业产品生产方面赶上而后超过包括美国在内的最发达的资本主义国家的任务，将通过在优先发展重工业基础上发展整个经济的办法来解决。苏联人的胜利丝毫无庸置疑。
    扎夏迪科指出了控制数字中规定的基本建设的宏伟规模，七年计划对基本建设的投资等于苏维埃政权建立以来历年投资的总和。
    扎夏迪科强调指出，目前首要的是效果问题和正确地使用投资的问题。他在发言中严厉地批评了前苏联国家计划委员会的领导，由于这个领导的过错，过去冻结了大笔资金，分散了资金，经常有许多工程不能完工，没有制止过分拖延工程期限。
    接着发言的是哈尔科夫州委员会第一书记季托夫，他谈到了这个乌克兰的大工业区三年来所取得的成就，以及它在今后七年中的任务。
    吉尔吉斯共产党中央委员会第一书记拉扎科夫在发言中强调指出，七年计划把全苏联的利益和各共和国的利益十分正确地结合起来了。
    拉扎科夫建议把开发吉尔吉斯的大煤矿区和建设伏龙芝—楚河铁路（这条铁路把共和国同苏联几条主要铁路干线连接起来）列入七年计划。
    爱沙尼亚共产党中央第一书记凯宾在发言中说，在加入苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟之前，爱沙尼亚只是资本主义国家的农业原料副产地。现在爱沙尼亚是一个工业—农业社会主义共和国，现在它的工业产量比战前1940年增加了八点六倍，尽管它在第二次世界大战期间遭到了大规模的破坏。
    苏共鞑靼州委员会第一书记伊格纳捷夫谈到过去落后的鞑靼的国民经济的发展时指出，鞑靼1958年的总产值比1913年增加了一百四十倍。
    伊格纳捷夫说，到七年计划完成时，鞑靼的工业总产量将比1958年增加84％。七年中鞑靼的石油业将钻五千个油井。共和国在国家燃料结构方面的比重将进一步提高。
    在下午会议上向代表大会致贺词的有：阿尔及利亚共产党中央委员会第一书记拉比·布哈利、摩洛哥共产党中央委员会第一书记阿里·亚塔、阿根廷共产党中央委员会总书记阿尔瓦雷斯和乌拉圭共产党中央委员会第一书记阿里斯门迪。他们的讲话受到了到会者的热烈欢迎。
    新华社莫斯科3日电　今天上午十时（莫斯科时间）苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会继续在大克里姆林宫开会，讨论赫鲁晓夫的报告。
    苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅首先发言。
    苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员弗·科兹洛夫在发言中说，苏维埃国家在苏共二十次代表大会到第二十一次代表大会期间，在建设的各个方面都坚定地向前迈进了一步。苏联人民完全有权利为他们所取得的胜利感到自豪。全面展开共产主义社会建设的七年计划在苏维埃国家面前展开了更加广阔的远景。他说，苏联和世界各国的全体劳动人民很注意正在讨论使我国生产力获得新的蓬勃发展的计划的代表大会，这是不奇怪的。大家都把苏联的成就看作是我们制度的胜利，这个制度以事实证明了社会主义比资本主义优越。
    科兹洛夫说，我们坚决反对战争，我们主张消灭国际关系中的紧张气氛。为了完成自己的计划，苏联人民需要和平。和平，这是列宁主义外交政策的基本内容。
    发言人接着说，苏联在走向进步的急速进程中不是孤独的。人民中国和社会主义阵营的其他国家同它在一起。世界社会主义体系是强大的力量。帝国主义的献媚者——改良主义者和修正主义者想在和平阵营内制造分裂，他们的可怜的企图是不会得逞的。
    科兹洛夫说，七年计划的完成将是建立共产主义物质技术基础方面的决定性因素。因此，国民经济中的进一步技术发展，现有企业的改造和现代化，就具有重要意义。工业中计划增加的劳动生产率有一半以上将依靠机械化和自动化来实现。科兹洛夫强调说，在某些部门还将进行真正的技术革命。
    苏共中央主席团候补委员别尔乌辛在会上发言。他说，第二十一次代表大会对苏联和整个国际生活的意义是无法估计的。近年来党所实行的改组工业和建筑业管理、加强集体农庄制度、扩大地方和共和国机构的权力等等措施，促进了经济成就的获得，提高了全体苏联人民的积极性。
    别尔乌辛接着说，在党和人民为实现重要措施而奋斗的时候，马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团走上了派别活动的道路，企图阻挠第二十次代表大会决议的执行。
    别尔乌辛说，我不能不怀着痛苦的心情承认，我在党的重要时刻没有识破这个集团的反党阴谋。我在我们党的最高机构代表大会面前说明这一点。我过去谴责，现在也在谴责反党集团的分裂活动。我在中央委员会六月全体会议上谈过这一点，在党的各次会议上也曾就这个问题作过发言。
    别尔乌辛表示完全同意赫鲁晓夫在代表大会的报告中和在中央委员会十二月全体会议上对反党集团的活动所作的论断。
    别尔乌辛向代表大会说明他如何走上了错误的道路。他说，尽管当年他对改组工业和建筑业的管理表示了怀疑，并且支持过对赫鲁晓夫的攻击，但是他没有同意反党集团所提出的撤换中央委员会领导的主张。
    别尔乌辛说，在关于必须开垦荒地的问题上以及像对南斯拉夫的关系这样的国际生活问题上，他是同意中央委员会的。
    别尔乌辛说，我在担任驻德意志民主共和国大使的期间，愈来愈体会到反党的宗派集团给苏联的政策带来了什么样的危害。
    别尔乌辛在发言中再一次强调指出，他同全党和苏联人民一样，认为近年来党中央委员会所执行的一切措施都是绝对正确的。他感谢中央委员会给他以赎回他对党的过错的机会，并且说，他将努力不辜负党现在所给他的信任。他说，他保证永远捍卫党的事业，为实现党的总路线、为和平事业、为共产主义而奋斗。
    苏联高等教育部长维·叶留金发言说，苏联高等学校的教授、教师和大学生都怀着无比欢欣的心情欢迎代表大会正在讨论的建设共产主义的计划——七年计划。
    叶留金说，在解决苏联面临的任务方面，受过良好训练的干部将起巨大的作用。共产党一向非常注意培养干部，并且在这方面取得了巨大的成就。在苏联，工农出身的知识分子成长起来了。叶留金谈到了培养干部的日益增长的速度，并且同其他国家进行了比较。
    叶留金在发言中谈到了进一步发展科学研究和高等学校的问题。他谈到了苏联为科学家的创造性劳动创造了广泛可能性，谈到了科学同国民经济的日益紧密的联系。
    叶留金强调指出，用共产主义的精神教育青年对共产主义的建设有着巨大的意义。实现党和政府关于教育同生产劳动相结合的决定将会促进这一点。
    苏共中央主席团委员库西宁说，苏联的七年计划和以后的远景计划，提出了使社会主义制度取得对资本主义制度的完全的经济胜利的历史性任务。
    库西宁指出，七年计划和远景计划，在政治方面将像多级火箭一样正确地把我国送进共产主义的轨道。
    库西宁强调指出了赫鲁晓夫报告中所阐述的理论原理的重要性。他说，我们党早就需要一个新纲领，这个纲领的草案应当在苏共下届代表大会前拟定好。这项任务是现实的，因为我们现在有一切根据把七年计划和远景计划作为纲领的基础。库西宁说，如果把赫鲁晓夫的报告作为苏共党纲的基础，那么就会得到一个很好的党纲。
    库西宁谴责马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团。他说，这个集团的日常实践事实上是对马克思列宁主义的修正。这些僵化的官僚主义者对一切新事物都感到格格不入。他们感到，如果党和人民着手完成新任务，他们就保不住自己的领导岗位，我相信，在我们的代表大会上没有一个人会不谴责反党集团的参加者。
    库西宁接着指出了加强国际主义联系和团结国际共产主义运动和工人运动的力量的重要性。他强调指出，第二十一次代表大会本身就是这些力量团结的光辉证明，这一点在世界各大洲兄弟党代表在代表大会上的讲话中也得到了反映。
    塔吉克共产党中央委员会第一书记乌尔扎巴耶夫发言说，苏联人民为迎接第二十一次代表大会所作出的辉煌成就和苏联人民对七年计划的控制数字的一致拥护，是对马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团的严厉的判决。这个集团脱离了党，不相信人民的创造力量。这个集团的参与者所作的解释是不能令人满意的。他认为，把派别集团的参与者继续留在党中央委员会未必适宜。
    接着发言的是斯大林诺经济区（乌克兰）国民经济委员会主席伊凡·佳迪克。
    在上午会议上最后一个发言的是著名物理学家伊戈尔·库尔恰托夫院士。
    库尔恰托夫说，正如赫鲁晓夫报告中所指出的，我国科学家将从事掌握可控制的热核反应，以便获得实际上无穷无尽的能源。
    他说，这个任务不是今天的问题，因为现在苏联拥有足够用很多年的必要的燃料资源。这个任务的提出是出于对人类未来、对共产主义社会的关怀。（附图片）
