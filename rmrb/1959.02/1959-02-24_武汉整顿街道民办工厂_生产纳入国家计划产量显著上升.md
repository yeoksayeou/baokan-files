    Wuhan Rectifies Street-Run Private Factories
    Production Incorporated into State Plans, Output Significantly Increases
    (Our Dispatch) Wuhan, Feb. 24 (Correspondent Guo Wenqing) reports: In Wuhan, a system of unified management and decentralized production has been implemented in some street-run private factories, greatly improving production levels.
    Since the summer of 1958, Wuhan has established more than 1,400 small factories in streets that previously had no industrial base. These factories serve large-scale industry, produce daily necessities, and provide processing and repair services. They have absorbed more than 42,000 street residents (the vast majority of whom are housewives) into production. To date, these factories have manufactured more than 1,000 types of products. Street residents' involvement in industry has not only created wealth for the country and increased residents' incomes but has also transformed consumption-oriented streets into production-oriented streets. Residents, who were previously scattered, have also been brought together through production.
    However, these small factories, which are managed by residents' committees, have been limited in their ability to further develop due to limited management capabilities and external connections. To change this situation, Dazhi, Baoshan, and other streets have taken the lead in implementing a system of unified management and decentralized production. The management rights of factories originally belonging to various residents' committees have been centralized to the street offices. From political work to production management and financial planning, the street offices are responsible for unified arrangements, and each factory carries out production under unified leadership. This has transformed private factories into the collective industry of the streets. Correspondingly, a "five fix and three guarantee" responsibility system has been established between the streets and factories, namely fixing the number of personnel, output value, profits to be turned over, investment, and economic expenditures; and guaranteeing the quantity and quality of products and the payment of profits. This facilitates centralized leadership and strengthens business management.
    In order to fully mobilize the production enthusiasm of each factory, in terms of finance, the street offices provide larger factories or comprehensive factories with a certain amount of working capital as a flexible expenditure for their production development, based on the implementation of a graded economic accounting system between the streets and factories. For small factories with few people and little capital that are not suitable for setting up accountants, the street offices uniformly account for them by setting up separate accounts for each household. In terms of production, the street offices make overall arrangements and reasonable adjustments based on the urgency of the overall production tasks and the specific conditions of each factory's equipment and labor force, so that those unfixed types of work (such as seasonal production) can receive corresponding production tasks.
    After the implementation of unified management, first of all, under the leadership of the street offices, the production of street factories was initially incorporated into the district and municipal plans; especially through the unified use of profits, in addition to paying taxes, distributing wages, and making public accumulation, the street offices can also rationally arrange expenditures for expanding reproduction and collective welfare. Secondly, with unified leadership, the collectivist ideology and production enthusiasm of the workers have been greatly enhanced, and they have tried every means to innovate technology and improve productivity. The production of street industries that have undergone rectification has increased significantly. Taking Baoshan Street's street industry as an example, in the five months before the rectification, the output value averaged only 140,000 to 150,000 yuan per month, while in December of last year after the rectification, the output value soared to 840,000 yuan.
    During the rectification process, in order to facilitate production development and management, small factories of the same type were merged, and reasonable adjustments were made in profit distribution and personnel arrangements, strengthening the backbone of each factory and establishing various systems. At present, according to the experience of unified management and decentralized production, Wuhan's districts are rectifying street factories in batches.

### 武汉整顿街道民办工厂  生产纳入国家计划产量显著上升

    武汉整顿街道民办工厂
    生产纳入国家计划产量显著上升
    本报讯　通讯员郭文清报道：武汉市部分街道民办工厂，实行统一管理、分散生产的制度，大大提高了生产水平。
    从1958年夏季以来，武汉市在原来没有生产基础的街道里，办起了为大工业服务、生产日用品、加工修理等类型的小工厂一千四百多个，吸收了四万二千多名街道居民（绝大多数是家庭妇女）参加了生产。到目前为止，这些工厂已经制造出一千多种产品。街道居民办工业不仅为国家创造了财富，增加了居民收入，而且把消费的街道改造成了生产的街道，原来处于分散状况的居民，也被生产联系起来了。
    但是，这些分属于居民委员会管理的小工厂，由于管理能力以及和外界联系有限，进一步发挥作用受到了限制。为了改变这种状况，大智、宝善等街，首先实行了统一管理、分散生产的制度，把原来分属于各居民委员会的工厂的管理权，集中到街道办事处，从政治工作到生产管理、财务计划，统一由街道办事处进行安排，各工厂在统一领导下进行生产。这就把民办工厂改变成了街道的集体工业。与此相适应，在街、厂之间建立起“五定三包”责任制，即定人员、产值、上缴利润、投资、经济开支的数量；包产品数量、质量和利润上缴。这样既便于集中领导，又加强了经营管理。
    为了充分发挥各厂的生产积极性，在财务方面，街、厂之间在实行分级经济核算的基础上，街道办事处给较大的厂或综合性工厂以一定的流动资金，作为它们发展生产的机动费用；人少、资金少而又不宜设会计的小厂，则由街道办事处分户立账统一核算。在生产上，街道办事处根据整个生产任务的轻重缓急、以及各厂的设备和劳动力等的具体情况，进行统筹安排和合理调剂，使那些不固定的工种（如生产带季节性），都能得到相应的生产任务。
    实行统一管理以后，首先，通过街道办事处的领导，把街道工厂的生产初步地纳入了区、市计划；尤其通过利润的统一使用，街道办事处除上交税款、分配工资、公共积累之外，还能合理地安排扩大再生产和集体福利的开支。其次，统一了领导，职工的集体主义思想和生产积极性有了很大的提高，他们千方百计地革新技术，提高生产率。经过整顿的街道工业的生产显著上升。以宝善街街道工业为例，整顿前的五个月里，产值平均每月只有十四、五万元，而整顿后的去年12月份，产值就猛升到八十四万元。
    在整顿过程中，为了便于发展生产和管理，把同类型的小厂进行了合并，在收益分配和人事安排上作了合理调整，充实了各厂的骨干力量，并建立了各种制度。目前，武汉各区根据统一管理、分散生产的经验，对街道工厂分批进行整顿。
