Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th - More than seven thousand representatives from all walks of life in Hanoi held a rally at the Hanoi People's Theater on the evening of the 19th to warmly celebrate the great achievements of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

President Ho Chi Minh delivered a speech at the meeting, saying that Comrade Khrushchev's report and the resolution of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the seven-year plan for building communism are extremely important documents, which further enrich the treasure trove of Marxist-Leninist theory. Vietnamese cadres must study these documents well.

President Ho Chi Minh said that the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has further made us see the unity and solidarity between the countries of the socialist family and between the various Marxist-Leninist parties. The congress has further made us see the incomparably magnificent strength of an army including thirty-five million communist fighters and a billion people who are selflessly building socialism and communism.

President Ho Chi Minh said that the Soviet people are striving to complete the great seven-year plan ahead of schedule and ahead of schedule with fiery construction enthusiasm. The Soviet people's construction enthusiasm is encouraging fraternal countries to move forward more rapidly.

President Ho Chi Minh said that the 21st Congress of the CPSU severely condemned the reactionary revisionism that violates Marxism-Leninism; the purpose of revisionism is to undermine the unity of the working class and frustrate the fighting spirit of the working people.

When President Ho Chi Minh talked about the Soviet Union's consistent peace policy, he said that the Soviet Union is working hard to safeguard world peace, but it has enough strength to eliminate enemies who dare to launch a crazy war against the Soviet Union.

President Ho Chi Minh's speech was interrupted from time to time by stormy applause.

Huang Wenhuan, member of the Central Political Bureau of the Vietnamese Labor Party and member of the Vietnamese Labor Party delegation to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, then made a report at the meeting, in which he introduced in detail the main contents of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan and the situation of the Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He said that the success of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the adoption of the Seven-Year Plan are a great victory of Marxist-Leninist doctrine, a victory of the socialist system, and a victory of the Soviet people and the people of the world. He said that if mankind's greatest desire at present is peace and the elimination of war, then the completion of the Soviet Union's seven-year plan, coupled with the further strengthening of the entire socialist camp, will play a decisive role in the fate of the world.

Soviet Ambassador to Vietnam Sokolov also spoke at the meeting. He said that the Communist Party and people of the Soviet Union will always support the socialist construction of the Vietnamese people and the struggle for a unified country. Finally, he shouted "Long live world peace!" in Vietnamese.

The congress finally unanimously adopted a congratulatory telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union amid warm applause.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th - According to TASS Tokyo, 19th: The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement today on the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The statement pointed out that the 21st Congress of the CPSU adopted a seven-year plan for developing the national economy, made a great contribution to the cause of socialism and building communism, and pointed out the prospects for consolidating peace for the whole world. This Congress is not only of outstanding historical significance to the Soviet people, but also to the people of the whole world. The statement pointed out the tremendous achievements made by the Soviet Union in science and technology and in economic development.

The statement talked about the bright prospects for the Soviet Union to complete its seven-year plan, and pointed out that this will be a decisive victory for socialism over capitalism in the peaceful economic competition.

The statement said that the working people of the world and all peace-loving people heartily welcome the seven-year plan for developing the national economy, welcome the bright prospects it brings for consolidating the cause of peace, and believe that it will be successfully realized. This plan gives them greater confidence and courage in their struggle for peace and communism.

The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party believes that the proposals put forward by Khrushchev in his report aimed at easing international tensions are of great significance. In this regard, the statement sharply criticized the Kishi Nobusuke government for pursuing anti-national and anti-democratic policies and reviving militarism in order to cater to the American imperialists. The statement pointed out that the brilliant prospects of the seven-year plan adopted by the 21st Congress of the CPSU inspire the working people of Japan, first of all the working class of Japan, and this is a powerful weapon in their struggle.

The statement went on to point out that the 21st Congress of the CPSU proved that the measures taken by the Central Committee of the CPSU against the anti-Party group that attempted to undermine the unity of the Party and obstruct the implementation of the resolutions of the 20th Congress were correct. The 21st Congress of the CPSU not only proved the unbreakable unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, but also proved the strong unity of the international communist movement based on proletarian internationalism. The statement concluded by saying that the Japanese Communists are extremely satisfied with the results of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, and they will more bravely and confidently launch a struggle against the reactionary policies of the American imperialists and the Japanese monopoly capitalists, and against the policies of militarizing the country, and strive to establish a peaceful, independent, democratic and neutral Japan.
