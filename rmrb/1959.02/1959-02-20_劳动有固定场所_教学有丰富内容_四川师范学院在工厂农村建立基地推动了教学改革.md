    Labor Has Fixed Locations, Teaching Has Rich Content
    Sichuan Normal College Establishes Bases in Factories and Rural Areas to Promote Teaching Reform

    (Our dispatch) Sichuan Normal College, based on the characteristics of normal education and centered on teaching reform, has established bases that combine teaching, scientific research, production labor, and school-running activities in factories and rural areas, further improving the quality of education.

    When establishing these bases, Sichuan Normal College fully considered the characteristics and teaching needs of different majors. The bases for the Chinese and History departments are mainly in rural areas, enabling teachers and students to better learn from the working people through agricultural labor. The Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry departments are mainly based in factories to better integrate with their respective majors. The time each major and grade spends at the base is also specifically arranged according to their characteristics, following systems such as "one, two, nine" (one month of vacation, two months of labor, nine months of study each year) and "one, three, eight." For example, sophomores, juniors, and seniors in the Mathematics Department spend two to four months each year at the four-combination base engaging in labor, scientific research, and school-running activities related to teaching. Freshmen, who need to learn more basic knowledge, participate in one month of production labor on campus each year. Currently, Sichuan Normal College has established a number of four-combination bases in places like the Shangyou People's Commune in Huayang County, Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, Chengdu 402 Factory, and Guanxian Yuzui Hydropower Station. The first batch of over two hundred teachers and students from the History, Chinese, Mathematics, and other departments have already conducted a series of activities at these bases.

    Teachers and students at the four-combination bases arrange various activities according to teaching needs. Juniors in the Chinese Department and sophomores in the History Department, according to the teaching plan, brought courses closely related to rural realities, such as folk literature and composition, and sections of Chinese ancient and medieval peasant uprisings, respectively, to the Shangyou People's Commune. They conducted on-site teaching, investigation, and research, while also participating in production labor and school-running activities. Juniors in the Mathematics Department brought courses like descriptive geometry and differential equations to the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory. In addition, when studying modern Chinese history, the History Department also plans to bring the course to factories to conduct on-site investigations into workers' lives and the workers' movement, and to study the development of modern Chinese industry. The Chemistry Department plans to bring the agricultural chemistry course to the countryside for on-site teaching. The college party organization also jointly studied with the party organizations at the bases to comprehensively arrange activity schedules. For example, at the Shangyou Commune, sophomores and teachers from the History Department spend two days a week (eight hours a day) on professional and political study, approximately two days on labor, and the remaining three days on commune work and school-running activities. Teachers have two days to prepare lessons. In their labor and work, teachers and students also conduct various special investigations and research.

    In their various activities, teachers and students pay particular attention to utilizing the favorable conditions of factories and rural areas to reform teaching work. First, they use the abundant practical materials gathered from production labor and work to enrich teaching content. The new industrial chemistry textbook written by the Chemistry Department based on factory investigation and research materials overcomes some shortcomings of past textbooks that were divorced from production and reality. For example, in the section on steel smelting, it added content on indigenous production methods; in the section on salt by-products, it used Sichuan data instead of Northeast sea salt by-product data. Second, they adopt the method of "the able being the teacher," inviting workers and peasants to give lectures based on the course content. In the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, the Mathematics Department invited veteran workers to teach rapid blueprint reading in the descriptive geometry course, combining it with workshop products and drawings. Students learned, observed, and practiced simultaneously, with excellent results. In the Shangyou Commune, the Chinese Department invited folk artists to jointly teach the folk literature course with teachers. The artists first performed and introduced the works, then the teachers theoretically analyzed the ideological content and artistic characteristics of the works. They also try to directly link teaching, scientific research, and school-running with labor. When the History Department's sophomores taught the section on peasant uprisings at the Shangyou Commune, they discovered that local peasants had once launched a struggle against feudal warlords and Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule. They then set the scientific research topic of "A History of the Huayang County Peasants' Uprising Struggle," conducting in-depth investigation and research and inviting peasants to give reports. Teachers and students here helped the peasants run an agricultural middle school and a political, cultural, and technical school. At the same time, they combined the work of running the school with research on the experience of developing education in the Shangyou Commune, listing this as a scientific research topic.

    Through engaging in teaching, scientific research, production labor, and school-running activities in factories and rural areas, teachers and students not only changed their thoughts and feelings and improved their political consciousness, but also greatly improved the quality of teaching. The Mathematics Department was previously considered a department for pure theoretical research. Now, thirty-six teachers and students who went to the Yuzui Hydropower Station in Guanxian learned courses such as operations research in conjunction with production during the twenty-odd days. They also collected more than three hundred mathematical problems from actual production and used the mathematical theoretical knowledge they had learned to solve many production problems. Solving the problem of the ring cutter bulk density table alone improved work efficiency two hundred times. The teachers and students helped factories and communes run dozens of schools of various types and also helped these schools compile teaching materials and train teachers, learning certain school-running skills.

    The practice of teachers and students at Sichuan Normal College has preliminarily proven that establishing four-combination bases in factories and rural areas has the following benefits: First, it suits the characteristics of normal education, providing relatively complete labor venues and facilitating the development of a complete set of school-running activities, from early childhood education to adult education, on the spot by teachers and students. This allows teaching, scientific research, production labor, and school-running activities to be combined with each other, enabling students to receive more comprehensive training in terms of ideology, learning, and school-running. Second, having a fixed base facilitates the systematic and comprehensive carrying out of investigation and research, enriching teaching, scientific research, and school-running work with abundant practical materials. Third, it allows the school to complete its predetermined teaching tasks according to plan with the help of factories and communes.

    In addition, the Physics, Chemistry, and other departments of this school have also established labor bases such as machine factories and chemical factories on campus to compensate for some of the shortcomings of off-campus bases in terms of meeting professional needs.

    劳动有固定场所　教学有丰富内容
    四川师范学院在工厂农村建立基地推动了教学改革
    本报讯　四川师范学院根据师范教育的特点，以教学改革为中心，在工厂、农村建立教学、科学研究、生产劳动和办学活动四结合的基地，进一步提高了教育质量。
    在建立基地时，四川师范学院充分考虑了不同专业的特点和教学需要。中文、历史两系的基地，以农村为主，使教师、学生在农业劳动中更好地向劳动人民学习，数学、物理、化学三系，则以工厂为主，以便更好地结合所学专业。各不同专业和年级到基地活动的时间，也根据其特点分别按“一、二、九”（每年放假一个月，劳动两个月，学习九个月）、“一、三、八”等制度，进行了具体安排。比如数学系二、三、四年级每年以二至四个月时间到四结合基地围绕教学进行劳动、科学研究和办学活动。一年级学生需要学习更多的基础知识，每年就在校内参加一个月的生产劳动。现在，四川师范学院已在华阳县上游人民公社、成都量具刃具厂、成都四○二厂、灌县鱼嘴水电站等处建立了一批四结合基地。历史、中文、数学等系第一批二百多个教师、学生，已分别在这些基地进行了一系列活动。
    师生们在四结合基地，根据教学需要安排各项活动。中文系三年级和历史系二年级根据教学计划，分别把同农村实际有密切联系的民间文学、习作等课和中国古代及中世纪农民起义等部分带到上游人民公社，一面现场教学，一面进行调查研究，同时参加生产劳动和进行办学活动。数学系三年级把画法几何、微分方程等课程带到成都量具刃具厂。此外，历史系在学习中国近代史时，还准备把课程带到工厂，实地调查工人生活和工人运动，研究中国近代工业的发展。化学系准备把农业化学课带到农村，进行现场教学。学院党组织还与所在基地的党组织共同研究，全面安排了活动时间。如历史系二年级师生在上游公社，每周以两天时间（每天八小时）进行专业学习和政治学习，两天左右参加劳动，其余三天参加社内工作和办学等活动，教师有两天用来备课。在劳动和工作中，师生们还进行各项专题调查研究。
    师生们在各项活动中，特别注意利用工厂、农村的有利条件，改革教学工作。首先，运用在生产劳动和工作中搜集来的丰富的实际资料，充实教学内容。化学系根据工厂调查研究资料写出的新的工业化学教材，克服了过去教材中脱离生产、脱离实际的某些缺点，比如，在钢铁冶炼部分，增加了土法生产的内容；制盐副产品部分，用四川的资料代替了东北海盐副产品的资料。其次，采取能者为师的办法，根据课程内容，邀请工人、农民讲课。数学系在成都量具刃具厂教画法几何的识图部分，邀请老工人结合车间产品和图纸，讲授快速识图法，学生们边学边看边作，效果很好。中文系在上游公社请民间艺人与教师共同讲授民间文学课，艺人先演唱和介绍，再由教师从理论上对作品的思想内容和艺术特点进行分析。他们还尽可能使教学、科学研究同办学、劳动直接联系起来。历史系二年级师生在上游公社讲授农民起义部分时，发现当地农民曾经发起反对封建军阀和蒋介石反动统治的斗争，就订出“华阳县农民起义斗争史”的科学研究题目，深入进行调查研究，并且邀请农民作报告。师生们在这里协助农民办起了农业中学和政治文化技术学校，同时结合办学工作，把研究上游公社教育事业发展经验列为科学研究题目。
    师生们在工厂、农村进行教学、科学研究、生产劳动和办学活动，不仅思想感情起了变化，政治觉悟有所提高，还大大提高了教学质量。数学系过去被认为是作纯理论性研究的专业。现在，到灌县鱼嘴水电站的三十六个教师和学生，在二十多天里，结合生产学习了运筹学等课程，还搜集到生产实际中的数学问题三百多个，并运用学得的数学理论知识解决了不少生产问题，其中仅环刀容重数表一个问题的解决，提高工效二百倍。广大师生协助工厂和公社办起各类学校几十所，并且帮助这些学校编写教材、培养师资，学到了一定的办学本领。
    四川师范学院师生们的实践初步证明，在工厂、农村建立四结合基地有以下好处：一、适应师范教育的特点，既有比较完整的劳动场地，又便于广大师生就地开展从幼儿教育到成人教育的整套办学活动，使教学、科学研究、生产劳动和办学活动能够相互结合，使学生在思想、学习和办学等方面得到比较全面的锻炼。二、有了固定基地，便于系统全面地开展调查研究，用丰富的实际材料充实教学、科学研究和办学工作。三、使学校在工厂、公社帮助下按计划完成预定的教学任务。
    此外，这个学校的物理、化学等系还在校内建立起机械厂、化工厂等劳动基地，以弥补校外基地在结合专业需要上的某些不足。
