Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, 1st – Tangshan Steel Plant workers overfulfilled their January production plan in the high-yield, high-quality red flag competition. By January 31st, they had increased the country's production of high-quality steel by more than 2,000 tons, and the qualified rate of steel ingots increased by 5% compared with the original plan.

Improving the qualified rate of steel ingots is the key to Tangshan Steel Plant’s better and more comprehensive completion of its production plan this year. From the beginning of this year, the factory's Party committee organized a competition and evaluation of red flag grabbing and model worker establishment among all employees, focusing on improving the quality of steel ingots, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers. When the Wang Yiyuan steelmaking team saw that the qualified rate of steel ingots produced by the Ma Guangzong team reached 95.65%, they earnestly studied and promoted the Ma Guangzong team’s operations, implemented normal and meticulous batching, and correct slagging and other advanced experiences. The qualified rate of steel ingots increased from 85% to 97%. The entire factory also formed a desulfurization team composed of leading cadres, technicians, and workers. Everyone used their brains and contributed ideas, proposing more than 70 desulfurization measures to fight against the great enemy of steel quality – high sulfur. After this stage of hard work, the qualified rate of steel ingots in the entire factory increased from 77.28% in the first ten days of the month to 95.74%. Among them, eight shifts created a new record of 100% qualified rate. As the sulfur content of steel ingots decreased, the life of the furnace lining was extended, and the output also increased, from more than 90 heats per day to more than 110 heats.

The steel rolling workers also put forward the fighting slogan of "rolling good steel into good materials" in the competition, and made great efforts in technical revolution. The workers came up with more than 300 suggestions from all aspects to overcome high sulfur. Leaders and technicians went to the workshop to conduct steel rolling material experiments with the workers, and immediately promoted their experience. For example, they adopted different heating times according to the different sulfur content and temperature of the steel ingots, which played a great role in improving the quality. In the competition, the workers also carried forward the spirit of ingenuity to improve equipment and operation methods, so that the efficiency of rolling steel increased from more than 300 tons per day in early January to more than 400 tons, with a maximum of more than 500 tons.

### 抓紧关键　开展竞赛  唐山钢厂增产两千多吨钢

    抓紧关键　开展竞赛
    唐山钢厂增产两千多吨钢
    新华社唐山1日电　唐山钢厂职工在高产优质红旗竞赛运动中超额完成1月份生产计划。到1月31日，已经为国家增产了二千多吨优质钢，钢锭合格率比原计划提高了5％。
    提高钢锭合格率是唐山钢厂今年更好更全面完成生产计划的关键。工厂党委从今年一开始就围绕提高钢锭质量在全厂职工中组织了夺红旗、树标兵的竞赛评比，大大鼓舞了职工的积极性。王益元炼钢小组见到马广宗小组生产的钢锭合格率达到95.65％，就认真学习推广了马广宗小组的操作，实行正常细致配料，正确化渣等先进经验，钢锭合格率由85％提高到97％。全厂还由领导干部、技术人员和工人共同组成攻硫小组，人人动脑筋，献计策，一共提出七十多条脱硫措施，和提高钢的质量的大敌——高硫展开斗争，经过这一阶段的苦战，全厂钢锭合格率由上旬的77.28％提高到95.74％，其中有八个班创造了合格率达到100％的新纪录。由于钢锭的含硫量降低，延长了炉衬的寿命，产量也随着增加，每天由炼九十多炉提高到一百一十多炉。
    轧钢工人们在竞赛运动中也提出“把好钢轧成好材”的战斗口号，大闹技术革命。工人们从各方面想办法战胜高硫，提出了三百多条意见。领导和技术人员都到车间和工人一起搞轧钢材的试验，搞出经验立即推广。例如他们根据钢锭含硫量和温度不同而采取不同的加热时间，对提高质量就起了很大作用。工人们在竞赛中也发扬巧干的精神改进了设备和操作方法，使轧制钢材的效率由1月初日产三百多吨提高到四百多吨，最高达到五百多吨。
