Acids and alkalis industry generally refers to the industries of sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, soda ash (i.e., alkali powder, baking soda), and caustic soda (i.e., lye). They have extremely wide uses and are almost essential for the production of all sectors of the national economy. Sulfuric acid, in particular, is known as the "mother of industry." This is because they are not only basic raw materials for modern industry, but also can chemically react with many metals and non-metals to produce many new substances.

Specifically, what is the relationship between the acids and alkalis industry and industrial and agricultural production and the people's material and cultural life?

Acids and alkalis are basic raw materials for modern industry, and the production of almost all industrial sectors directly or indirectly uses acids and alkalis. In the metallurgical industry: mining requires explosives, and making explosives requires sulfuric acid and nitric acid; steelmaking requires soda ash as a desulfurizer; steel rolling requires sulfuric acid as a detergent; other processes such as aluminum smelting, nickel production, tungsten production, copper smelting, magnesium smelting, titanium smelting, gold extraction, and hard alloy smelting either use sulfuric acid or alkali; in the petroleum industry, refining petroleum requires sulfuric acid and alkali to remove impurities to produce gasoline, kerosene, etc.; many chemical raw materials in the chemical industry, such as plastics, dyes, coatings, pigments, solvents, synthetic rubber, and artificial fibers, need acids and alkalis to manufacture; the transportation industry needs sulfuric acid and caustic soda for batteries in cars and trains, and for explosives for opening mountains and building roads; in cutting-edge science, such as the extraction of germanium for semiconductors in the radio and electronics industry, and the extraction of uranium for the atomic energy industry, large amounts of sulfuric acid are needed; the defense industry cannot do without acids and alkalis; the well-known yellow explosive is a product of nitric acid treatment; other industrial productions such as textiles, papermaking, soap, enamel, glass, and food also require large amounts of acids and alkalis.

Acids and alkalis are important substances for promoting the great development of agricultural production. The most commonly used chemical fertilizer in agricultural production, such as ordinary superphosphate, is made by reacting phosphate rock with sulfuric acid; ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate are made by reacting synthetic ammonia with sulfuric acid and nitric acid respectively; in pesticides such as copper sulfate, DDT, and 666, some directly use acids and alkalis in the manufacturing process, and some use the by-product chlorine of caustic soda; various fibrous agricultural and sideline products and wild plants can be processed into rayon, etc. after being treated with caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, and bleaching powder (a by-product of caustic soda).

Acids and alkalis are closely related to people's lives. In people's daily lives, whether it is clothing, food, housing, transportation, or cultural entertainment, health care and other material and cultural needs, they are directly or indirectly related to acids and alkalis. For example, people want to wear clothes, and they always hope to wear them beautifully, which requires bleaching powder to bleach the cloth, or alkali treatment to mercerize it, or dyes to dye the cloth into bright colors; people use soap to wash their faces and clothes, and soap is made from oils and fats and caustic soda; people eat steamed buns, biscuits, bread, MSG, etc., which also requires a large amount of soda ash, baking soda (also known as heavy alkali, made from soda ash) or hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, etc. to manufacture; the glass on the doors and windows of people's houses, daily enamel products, steel pots, tungsten filaments in light bulbs, copper wires in electric wires, and many small hardware items are all related to acids and alkalis in the manufacturing process. Some are directly used as raw materials, and some need to be treated with acids and alkalis before they can be made. In cultural life: the paper for printing books and newspapers requires caustic soda to be made, and bleaching powder is also used for bleaching. Various chemical drugs used to prevent and treat diseases, such as antipyretics and anti-inflammatory tablets, some (such as aspirin) use acids and alkalis in the manufacturing process, and some (such as anti-inflammatory tablets) use acids and alkalis as part of the drug.

In short, the acids and alkalis industry is very closely related to mineral mining, metallurgy, petroleum, chemical, defense, textile, papermaking, enamel, glass, soap, food and other industrial sectors and agricultural production, as well as people's lives. Therefore, all countries in the world attach great importance to the development of the acids and alkalis industry and regard the production level of the acids and alkalis industry as a sign of measuring a country's degree of industrialization.

Since liberation, China's acids and alkalis industry has made great progress under the leadership of the Party; technically, from design and construction to production and operation, it has been mastered proficiently. The main raw materials required by the acids and alkalis industry, such as salt, sulfur-containing minerals, and coal, are extremely abundant in our country, so the development prospect of China's acids and alkalis industry is extremely bright.

    酸碱·生产·生活
    酸碱工业一般是指硫酸、硝酸、盐酸和纯碱（即碱面、苏打）、烧碱（即火碱）等工业。它们的用途极广泛，几乎为国民经济各部门的生产所必需。特别是硫酸被称为“工业之母”。这是由于它们不仅是现代工业的基本原料，而且还能和许许多多的金属、非金属起化学作用，产生许多新的物质。
    具体说来，酸碱工业与工农业生产和人民物质文化生活的关系是怎样的呢？
    酸碱是现代工业的基本原料，各个工业部门的生产，差不多都直接或间接地使用酸碱。在冶金工业方面：开矿要用炸药，而造炸药要用硫酸和硝酸，炼钢要用纯碱作脱硫剂，轧钢要用硫酸作洗涤剂，其他如炼铝、制镍、炼钨、炼铜、炼镁、炼钛、炼金及冶炼硬质合金等等，都是不用硫酸即用碱；石油工业中精炼石油必须用硫酸和碱除杂质，制成汽油、灯油等；化学工业中的许多化工原料，如塑料、染料、涂料、颜料、溶剂、合成橡胶、人造纤维等，都要用酸碱来制造；交通运输业要用硫酸和烧碱作汽车、火车上的蓄电池，作开山筑路的炸药；尖端科学中，如无线电电子工业半导体用的锗的提取，原子能工业用的铀的提取，都需要大量硫酸；国防工业更离不开酸碱，大家熟知的黄色炸药，即是硝酸处理后的产物；其他如纺织、造纸、肥皂、搪瓷、玻璃、食品等工业生产，也都需要大量酸碱。
    酸碱是促进农业生产大发展的重要物质。农业生产中最常用的化学肥料，如普通过磷酸钙，就是用磷灰石与硫酸作用制成的；硫铵、硝铵是用合成氨分别与硫酸、硝酸作用制成的；农药中硫酸铜、滴滴涕、六六六等，制造过程中有的直接用酸碱，有的要用烧碱的联产品氯气；各种含纤维质的农副产品及野生植物，用烧碱、盐酸、漂白粉（烧碱的联产品）处理以后，就可以制成人造棉等。
    酸碱和人民生活有紧密的联系。在人们日常生活中，无论是衣、食、住、行还是文化娱乐、卫生保健等物质的和文化的需要，都直接或间接与酸碱有联系。如人们要穿衣服，而且总希望穿得漂亮一些，这就必须用漂白粉把布漂白，或者用碱处理得发生丝光，或者用染料把布染成鲜艳的颜色；人们洗脸、洗衣服要用肥皂，肥皂就是用油脂与烧碱制成的；人们吃馒头、饼干、面包、味精等，这也需要大量的纯碱、小苏打（又叫重碱，是纯碱作的）或盐酸、硫酸等来制造；人们的住宅门窗上的玻璃，日用的搪瓷制品、钢精锅、电灯泡中的钨丝、电线中的铜线和许多小五金等，制造过程都与酸碱有关。有的是直接用作原料，有的需用酸碱处理才能制成。在文化生活方面：印书、报的纸张，就要用烧碱制造，还要用漂白粉漂白。防治疾病用的各种化学药品，如解热药、消炎片等，有的（如阿斯匹灵）在制造过程中要用酸碱，有的（如消炎片），酸碱是药物的一部分。
    总之，酸碱工业与矿物开采、冶金、石油、化学、国防、纺织、造纸、搪瓷、玻璃、肥皂、食品等工业部门和农业生产，以及人民生活关系都非常密切。因此，世界各国都十分重视酸碱工业的发展，把酸碱工业的生产水平，作为衡量一个国家工业化程度的一种标志。
    解放后，我国酸碱工业在党的领导下有了很大发展；在技术上，从设计、施工到生产操作，都已熟练地掌握了。酸碱工业所需要的主要原料食盐、含硫矿物、煤等物资，在我国极为丰富，所以我国酸碱工业的发展前途是极其光辉灿烂的。　　　　　　　　　（魏瑞朗）（附图片）
