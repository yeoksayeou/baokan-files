    Rushing to Repair and Manufacture Irrigation and Drainage Machinery
    Anhui Strives to Complete Repair and Manufacture of 100,000 Horsepower by April
    Tianjin Dozens of Factories Cooperate to Rush Produce Gas Engines

    Our Newspaper Hefei, 21st – The mechanical industry departments of Anhui Province are vigorously rushing to repair and manufacture agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery.

    Anhui currently has 3,183 irrigation and drainage machines. Due to the long-term drought last year and most being transferred to support industrial production, more than 50% require repairs to varying degrees. At the same time, with the construction of water conservancy projects in various places, the area of ​​mechanical and electrical irrigation will increase from more than 3 million mu last year to nearly 10 million mu. The original irrigation and drainage machinery of more than 70,000 horsepower is far from meeting the needs. Therefore, this year's irrigation and drainage machinery not only has a large repair and parts task, but also a very large production task. The production task for February to April alone is more than 60,000 horsepower. These repaired and newly manufactured irrigation and drainage machinery, totaling more than 100,000 horsepower, are required to be basically completed before April 15th and the end of April, respectively.

    In order to complete the repair, parts supply and manufacturing tasks of irrigation and drainage machinery more, faster, better, and more economically, the Provincial Party Committee instructed all localities to return all irrigation and drainage machinery transferred to support industry, along with the personnel. It also instructed that "major repairs should be handled by the province, medium repairs by the special districts, and minor repairs by the counties." Based on this instruction, various localities have adopted many measures. For example, they organized repair workers from irrigation and drainage stations, farms, and tractor stations, as well as bicycle repair workers, to carry out rush repairs on the spot. Larger product components that can be manufactured within the province are assigned to various factories to be contracted out by sector or produced by specialized factories. For example, the Provincial Mechanical Research Institute is specifically responsible for producing piston rings, and the Hefei and Wuhu meter factories are specifically responsible for producing thermal instruments. Various localities have also organized mobile repair teams to go deep into rural areas to help people's communes cultivate technical forces and repair irrigation and drainage machinery.

    Because both the repair and manufacturing tasks are very large, various localities have arranged the repair and parts tasks to be completed as a rush task, so that they can be put into use quickly. At the same time, it can also prepare for the mass production of irrigation and drainage machinery from the repair process.

    Many of the diesel engines, boiler-trolley engines, electric motors, gas engines and other power irrigation and drainage machinery and various water pumps produced in Anhui this year have not been manufactured in the past or have been produced very little, and will be produced in batches this year.

    In order to strengthen leadership over this work, the Provincial Party Committee designated units such as the Agricultural and Industrial Department, the Mechanical Parts Department, and the Mechanical Industry Department to transfer cadres to form an agricultural machinery repair and parts office. Lu'an, Anqing and other places have also successively established specialized organizations to be responsible for leading the repair and manufacturing of irrigation and drainage machinery.

    Xinhua News Agency – Workers in Tianjin's electromechanical industry are working hard to rush-produce irrigation and drainage equipment. They plan to produce 63,000 horsepower of gas engines by the end of April to support agricultural production.

    Because rural areas are implementing deep plowing and close planting, the water demand of the land has increased, coupled with the lack of rain and snow last winter, it is even more necessary to strengthen irrigation. Therefore, supplying rural areas with a large amount of irrigation and drainage equipment has become an urgent task for the electromechanical industry. At present, Tianjin Tractor Manufacturing Plant and Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Plant have undertaken the main task of producing more than 60,000 horsepower of gas engines. In addition, more than 30 electromechanical, handicraft, chemical, and textile machinery factories are cooperating to produce gas engine parts. These factories have now reorganized their production plans and formulated specific measures. The forging press factory, which casts the body parts of gas engines, decided to take measures to increase equipment utilization and reorganize the labor organization of the foundry workshop to make full use of casting equipment. This will not only complete the casting task of gas engine bodies, but also the production tasks of some of the factory's original large products will not be affected.

    The workers of various factories also used the method of vigorously carrying out technical revolution to solve the problem of raw materials. The locomotive and vehicle accessories factory, which produces crankshafts, uses nodular cast iron instead of forged crankshafts, and uses lost mold casting, which not only solves the raw material problem, but also improves production efficiency. Workers at the Tractor Manufacturing Plant are experimenting with turning high-sulfur white cast iron into gray cast iron to manufacture gas engine parts to supplement the shortage of gray cast iron.

### 赶修赶造排灌机械

    赶修赶造排灌机械
    安徽力争四月修造完成十万马力
    天津数十个工厂协作赶制煤气机
    本报合肥21日电　安徽省机械工业部门正大力赶修、赶制农业排灌机械。
    安徽现有排灌机械三千一百八十三台，由于去年长期抗旱和大部分调去支援工业生产，有50％以上需要进行不同程度的修理。同时，随着各地兴修水利工程，机电灌溉面积将由去年的三百多万亩增加到近一千万亩，原来七万多马力的排灌机械，已远远不能满足需要。因而今年的排灌机械不仅修配任务大，生产任务也很大。仅2月份至4月份的生产任务就达六万多马力。这批修理和新制的十万多马力的排灌机械，都分别要求在4月15日以前和4月底基本完成。
    为了多、快、好、省地完成排灌机械的修配和制造任务，省委指示各地，凡是调去支援工业的排灌机械，一律连人带机械归队。并指示要“大修归省，中修归专区，小修归县”。各地根据这一指示，采取了很多措施。如组织排灌站、农场、拖拉机站的修理工人和脚踏车修理工人就地突击修配，凡属省内能够制造的较大的产品部件，分别指定各厂分片包干或由专业厂专门生产。如省机械研究所专门负责生产活塞环，合肥和芜湖两个仪表厂专门生产热工仪表。各地还组织流动修配组，深入农村，帮助人民公社培养技术力量和修理排灌机械。
    因为修理和制造任务都很大，各地在安排时，把修配作为突击任务完成，这样就可以很快的排上用场。同时，还可从修理过程中来做好大批生产排灌机械的准备工作。
    安徽今年生产的柴油机、锅驼机、电动机、煤气机等动力排灌机械和各种水泵，有不少是过去没有制造过或生产很少的，今年都要成批生产。
    为了加强对这一工作的领导，省委指定由农工部、机件部、机械工业厅等单位，抽调干部成立了农业机械修配办公室。六安、安庆等地也先后成立了专门组织，负责领导排灌机械的修理制造工作。

    新华社讯　天津市机电工业职工正在紧张地赶制排灌设备。他们计划到4月底生产出六万三千马力的煤气机，支援农业生产。
    由于各地农村实行深翻密植，土地需水量增多，加上去冬雨雪少，就更需要加强浇灌工作。因此，供应农村大量排灌设备就成为机电工业的一项紧要任务。目前，天津市拖拉机制造厂和天津市内燃机厂已经承担了生产六万多马力煤气机的主要任务。另外有三十多个机电、手工业、化工、纺织机械等工厂协作生产煤气机的零件。这些工厂目前都重新安排了生产计划，制定了具体的措施。为煤气机浇铸机体部件的锻压机床厂，决定采取提高设备利用率的措施，重新安排铸工车间的劳动组织，充分利用浇铸设备，这样不但可以完成煤气机机体的浇铸任务，而且本厂原来的一些大型产品的生产任务也不会受到影响。
    各厂职工还用大搞技术革命的办法来解决原材料的问题。生产曲轴的机车车辆附件厂采用球墨铸铁代替锻制曲轴，并用漏模浇铸，既解决了原料问题，又提高了生产效率。拖拉机制造厂职工正在试验将高硫白口铁变为灰口铁，用来制造煤气机的零件，以补灰口铁的不足。
