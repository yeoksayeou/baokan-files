Washing Coal and Coking Experience Introduction

    Simple Flume Washer Coal Preparation
    Zhao Qingchun, Director of the Coal Preparation Plant, Nantong Coal Mine, Chongqing

    The coal preparation plant of Nantong Coal Mine in Chongqing was originally a small manual panning and soil-based coal preparation plant. The workers of this plant, based on the past method of flume washer coal preparation, manufactured two slime coal flume washer machines, which enabled this small soil-based coal preparation plant to develop into a medium-sized coal preparation plant capable of processing 600,000 tons of raw coal annually. This flume washer coal preparation machine is made entirely of wood, which is not only simple in structure, low in investment, and quick to build, but also easy to operate. The labor efficiency and recovery rate of refined coal are very high, and the ash content of the washed refined coal is also very low. It is a very good coal preparation equipment for the current high-speed development of the coking industry and improvement of coke quality.

    Structure of Wooden Slime Coal Flume Washer

    The flume washer on the flume washer coal preparation machine is made of dry wood boards with a thickness of 40 mm, and is架 in a frame made of wood or brick. The washing tank is divided into five layers, each with a certain distance and a different number of washing tank discharge bins. The first, second, and third layers of the washing tank are refined coal tanks, the fourth layer is the middlings tank, and the fifth layer is the tailings conveying tank, which discharges gangue. A layer of false bottom plate is provided at the bottom of each tank to protect the bottom plate and adjust the slope of the washing tank.

    Characteristics of Wooden Flume Washer

    I. The structure of the wooden slime coal flume washer coal preparation machine is very simple and easy to operate. This coal preparation machine does not use steel and can be manufactured by ordinary carpenters, making it easy to promote.

    II. Low investment and fast construction. This kind of flume washer coal preparation machine itself does not require the construction of factory buildings. Only a brick-wood structure canopy or straw mat canopy is needed. A slime coal flume washer coal preparation plant with an annual processing capacity of 300,000 tons of coal only requires an investment of 50,000 yuan and can be fully completed in more than 20 days.

    Coal Washing Effect

    Using this coal washing machine to wash raw coal with a particle size of less than 13 mm and an ash content of 15% to 16%, the recovery rate of refined coal can reach about 65%, and the ash content of refined coal can be reduced to 11%. The efficiency of each worker reaches 10 to 13 tons.

    Precautions During Operation

    I. The raw materials entering the wash should be uniform.

    II. It is necessary to frequently analyze and study the quality and washability of the raw coal entering the wash, so as to adjust the coal types in a timely manner to ensure the quality of refined coal.

    III. The coal and water should be properly matched. The amount of water should not be too large or too small. If the amount of water is too large, turbulent flow will occur in the washing tank. If the amount of water is too small, the coal in the flume will become thick and糊, which will affect the coal washing efficiency.

    IV. If the particle size of the raw coal entering the wash becomes finer, immediately close the first row of discharge bins and reduce the amount of propulsion water to make the coal and water suitable. If it is still not normal, the rising water flow of the second and third rows of discharge bins can be adjusted to ensure that the coal and the inclusions in the coal are well stratified in the tank.

    简易流洗槽选煤
    重庆市南桐煤矿选煤厂厂长　赵庆春
    重庆市南桐煤矿选煤厂原来是一座很小的人工淘洗土选煤厂，这个厂的工人根据过去流洗槽选煤方法，制造了两台末煤流洗槽选煤机，使这座小土选煤厂发展成为一年能处理六十万吨原煤的中型选煤厂。这种流洗槽选煤机全是用木料制造的，不仅构造简单，投资少，建厂快，而且容易操作，劳动效率和精煤的回收率都很高，洗选出来的精煤灰分也很低，是当前高速度发展炼焦工业和提高焦炭质量的一种很好的选煤设备。
    木质末煤流洗槽构造
    流洗槽选煤机上的流洗槽是用四十公厘厚的干木板钉制的，架在用木料做的或是砖砌的架子上。洗槽分五层，每层都有一定距离和不同数量的洗槽排料箱。洗槽的一、二、三层是精煤槽，第四层是中煤槽，第五层是尾矿输送槽，排洗矸石。每层槽底部都设有一层假底板用来保护底板和调整洗槽坡度。
    木质流洗槽的特点
    一、木制末煤流洗槽选煤机构造很简单，操作方便，这种选煤机不用钢材，一般木工就能制造，便于推广。
    二、投资少，建厂快。这种流洗槽选煤机本身不用建筑厂房，只搭个砖木结构的顶棚或草席顶棚就可以，一座年处理三十万吨煤的末煤流洗槽选煤厂只用五万元投资，二十多天就能全部建成。
    洗煤效果
    用这种洗选煤机洗选粒度小于十三公厘、灰分在15％到16％的原煤，精煤的回收率能达到65％左右，精煤灰分降到11％。每个工的效率达十吨到十三吨。
    操作中应注意的事项
    一、入洗的原料要均匀。
    二、要经常分析研究入洗原煤的质量和可洗情况，以便及时调配煤种，保证精煤质量。
    三、煤水要配合适宜，不能使水量过大或过小，水量大了洗槽中要成乱流现象，水量小了流槽中的煤会成稠糊状态，这都会影响洗选煤效率。
    四、入洗原煤的粒度如果变细时，立即关闭第一排料箱和减少推进水量，使煤水适宜，如果还不正常时，可调整二、三排料箱的上升水流，保证煤和煤中的夹杂物在槽内很好的分层。（附图片）
