Observer's Commentary

	On February 15th, Xiao Fangzhou, Deputy Secretary-General of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, once again expressed the solemn position taken by the Chinese people on the issue of Sino-Japanese trade when meeting with Eichi Shukutani, Vice President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and Chairman of the Japan Commodity Exhibition.

	Regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese trade, the attitude of the Chinese people has long been very clear. We have always believed that developing Sino-Japanese trade on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual friendship is a good thing, in line with the interests and aspirations of the people of both countries, and is very promising. However, the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government, which has consistently adopted a hostile policy towards China, not only carried out various obstructions and sabotage during the signing process of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, but also brazenly tore up this agreement and repeatedly condoned thugs to insult the Chinese national flag. Under these circumstances, all responsibility and consequences for the interruption of Sino-Japanese trade should be borne entirely by the Kishi Nobusuke government. As long as the Kishi Nobusuke government does not change its hostile attitude towards China, does not abandon its conspiracy to create two Chinas, and does not stop continuing to obstruct the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan, the issue of Sino-Japanese trade is out of the question.

	This issue was originally very clear and requires no further explanation. It is just that recently, Kishi Nobusuke suddenly and dramatically released the air of "restoring Japan-China trade," as if the responsibility for the failure to restore Sino-Japanese trade mainly lies with the Chinese people. Therefore, it is necessary to expose the two-faced and deceptive tactics of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

	Kishi Nobusuke first denies his responsibility for undermining Sino-Japanese trade relations, saying that "it is regrettable that Japan-China relations have fallen into a state of interruption. However, there is no fact that we have stopped conducting Japan-China negotiations." He declares that he has "no hostility or unfriendly thoughts towards China"; "(The Japanese) government's consistent policy is to make efforts to bring benefits to both sides through trade and cultural exchanges."; and that all statements about hostility towards China are due to "misunderstandings" on the part of China and Japan.

	Kishi Nobusuke thinks that with just a few nice words, he can dress himself up as a supporter of improving Sino-Japanese relations, lightly dismiss his responsibility for undermining Sino-Japanese relations, and even bite back, completely shifting the responsibility to the Chinese people, thereby making a big splash in the Japanese local elections. Unfortunately, people have long lost trust in Kishi Nobusuke; they not only listen to his words, but also observe his actions. Kishi Nobusuke's many words and deeds precisely prove that his attitude towards China is not "no hostility or unfriendly thoughts at all," but that there has been no change in his hostile and unfriendly thoughts. Since brazenly tearing up the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, Kishi Nobusuke has never stopped slandering and attacking China, and has become increasingly intensified. On October 9, 1958, in an interview with Brown of the American Broadcasting Corporation, Kishi Nobusuke openly slandered China as an "aggressor," calling the military provocations carried out by American imperialism against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait region "an international war against communist aggression." Kishi Nobusuke said that "for the sake of Japan's security," the Chinese people must never be allowed to recover their own territory of Taiwan. Kishi Nobusuke is also painstakingly trying to delete the clause in the Japanese Constitution that prohibits war, using the excuse of "preserving the free world" to demand sending troops abroad and colluding with the United States to expand into Southeast Asia. In addition, the Kishi Nobusuke government has repeatedly condoned thugs to insult the Chinese national flag and has been slow to explain. Although the Nagasaki incident was met with serious protests from the Chinese people and strong condemnation from Japanese public opinion, it was finally settled by announcing a "fine of 500 yen" for the thugs. What is especially intolerable is that after the Nagasaki incident, Kishi Nobusuke once again condoned thugs in Yokohama and Tokyo to tear down and even burn the Chinese national flag in public, and has not yet made an explanation. The Kishi Nobusuke government has also been working hard to follow the United States in creating "two Chinas." The Kishi Nobusuke government has always emphasized that "Japan must maintain its current diplomatic relations with the Kuomintang Chinese government in Taiwan," and said that exchanges with China must separate politics and economics, that is, trade should be discussed, but the reactionary policy of continuing to be hostile to China politically cannot be changed. Recently, Kishi Nobusuke even publicly stated in the Japanese Diet that "due to international credibility, it is necessary to always respect the Taiwan government. This is Japan's diplomatic line." Are these words and deeds not enough to expose the true face of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Japanese monopoly capital it represents? Can the Chinese people allow the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards China and not trade with Japan? If Kishi Nobusuke says that his blatant words and deeds of hostility towards China are out of "friendship" for the Chinese people, isn't this too deceiving? Are the Chinese people only not "misunderstanding" if they allow the Kishi Nobusuke government to insult and arbitrarily manipulate them, and agree to his two-faced approach of separating politics and economics?

	The Chinese people have always had a very accurate understanding of the Kishi Nobusuke government's acts of insulting the People's Republic of China and deliberately provoking 600 million Chinese people, and there will never be any misunderstandings. The Chinese people will never tolerate the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and will never allow the Kishi Nobusuke government to manipulate them. Why did Kishi Nobusuke suddenly start singing the tune of "opening up the deadlock in Japan-China relations" and appear as a "enthusiastic" role in Sino-Japanese trade at this time, after issuing lengthy remarks that slander and attack China? It's simple: because Kishi Nobusuke blindly follows American imperialism, violates the will of the Japanese people, implements a latent imperialist policy externally, and practices fascist rule internally, threatening the peace and security of the Japanese nation and Asian countries, he has been met with strong resistance from the Japanese people. Now, the voices calling for the overthrow of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet are getting louder and louder, and the Japanese people's movement to demand the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations has increasingly become a powerful force that cannot be ignored in Japanese political life. Even insightful people in the Liberal Democratic Party have issued accusations against the Kishi Nobusuke government. With the long-term and deepening of the Japanese economic crisis, the crisis of the Kishi Nobusuke government has become increasingly serious. Kishi Nobusuke himself was also forced to admit: "Internationally, the free camp is watching us with uneasy expressions; domestically, just as the House of Councillors election is about to be held and the Diet is about to reconvene, the situation will become very difficult to deal with."

	It can be seen that the reason why the Kishi Nobusuke government is eager to make a gesture of "opening up the deadlock in Japan-China relations" is nothing more than to deceive the Japanese people and get through the current political crisis. Look, when a Socialist Party member questioned the government in the Diet about whether calling for talks with China was to cope with the election, the Kishi Nobusuke government did not dare to answer directly. Isn't this hitting Kishi Nobusuke's sore spot? In fact, Kishi Nobusuke's emphasis on "separation of politics and economics" is precisely out of political considerations. Didn't Foreign Minister Fujiyama of the Kishi Nobusuke government openly admit that "the statement regarding the convening of Japan-China ambassador-level talks was mostly 'propaganda' for the House of Councillors election"? It is obvious that although Kishi Nobusuke "has a smile on his lips" or sings the tune of "restoring Japan-China trade," his hostile stance towards China has not changed at all. The most powerful evidence is what Kishi Nobusuke himself said: "Regarding the issue of Communist China, I think there is no need to change the government's past attitude."

	In fact, this two-faced approach of Kishi Nobusuke is nothing new to us. At the beginning of 1958, due to the Japanese people's increasing dissatisfaction with the Kishi Nobusuke government's policies and the deterioration of the Japanese economic situation, the trend of dissolving the House of Representatives and holding a general election in advance had become a foregone conclusion. In order to increase his campaign capital and deceive votes, didn't Kishi Nobusuke also try every possible means to resolve the issue of concluding the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement before dissolving the House of Representatives? He tacitly allowed the Japanese three-group delegation to come to Beijing to negotiate and sign the trade agreement, but once the purpose of deceiving votes had been achieved, he brazenly tore up the Fourth Trade Agreement, regardless of everything, and openly undermined Sino-Japanese relations. Kishi Nobusuke is trying to replay the old trick this time. Who else can Kishi Nobusuke deceive? He can't deceive the Chinese people, nor can he deceive the Japanese people. As long as the Kishi Nobusuke government does not change its hostile attitude towards China, continues to create the conspiracy of "two Chinas," and continues to obstruct the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan, then the Kishi Nobusuke government's sweet talk will never change the Chinese people's firm position.

	At present, the Kishi Nobusuke government's sabotage of Sino-Japanese trade has caused many difficulties for the Japanese economy, especially for some small and medium-sized Japanese enterprises. The Chinese people express deep sympathy for the difficult situation faced by these small and medium-sized enterprises due to the interruption of Sino-Japanese trade. We know that the attitude of the Kishi Nobusuke government does not represent the wishes of the Japanese people, and its approach is doomed to fail. The Chinese people are willing to live in friendship with the Japanese people and have been working to promote Sino-Japanese friendship. The Japanese people have also actively worked to enhance the friendship between the people of China and Japan, and urgently demand the early restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. We believe that despite Kishi Nobusuke's sabotage and obstruction of the development of normal relations between the two countries, despite Kishi Nobusuke's artificial obstacles on the road to Sino-Japanese friendship, the friendly relations between the people of China and Japan will eventually overcome all artificial obstacles and continue to develop forward through the joint efforts of the people of the two countries.

    岸信介的姿态骗不了人
    2月15日，中国国际贸易促进委员会副秘书长萧方洲，在接见日本国际贸易促进会副会长、日本商品展览会理事长宿谷荣一的时候，再一次表明了中国人民对于中日贸易问题所采取的严正立场。
    关于中日贸易问题，中国人民的态度早已十分明确。我们一向认为，在平等互利和相互友好的基础上发展中日贸易是一件好事，是符合两国人民的利益和愿望的，也是大有前途的。但是一贯对中国采取敌视政策的日本岸信介政府，不仅在第四次中日贸易协定签订过程中进行种种阻挠和破坏，而且最后竟悍然撕毁这一协定，并一再纵容暴徒侮辱中国国旗。在这种情况下，中日贸易中断的一切责任和后果，完全应由岸信介政府承担。只要岸信介政府一天不改变它对中国的敌视态度，不放弃制造两个中国的阴谋，不停止继续阻挠中日两国正常关系的恢复，中日贸易问题就无从谈起。
    这个问题本来是一清二楚的，无需多讲。只是近来岸信介忽然像煞有介事地放出“恢复日中贸易”的空气，似乎中日贸易不能恢复的责任主要是在中国人民方面。因此，揭穿一下岸信介政府这种两面三刀、蒙混视听的手法，是有必要的。
    岸信介首先抵赖他破坏中日贸易关系的责任，说什么“日中关系陷于中断状态，是令人遗憾的事情。但是，并没有由我们这方面停止进行日中谈判的事实。”他表白自己“对中国丝毫没有敌意和不友好的想法”；“（日本）政府一贯采取的方针是，进行努力，以便通过贸易和文化交流给双方带来利益。”；而所有关于敌视中国的说法倒是出于中日方面的“误解”。
    岸信介以为单凭几句漂亮话，就可以把自己装扮成一个改善中日关系的支持者，就可以把他破坏中日关系的责任轻轻推开，甚至反咬一口，把责任完全推到中国人民身上，从而在日本地方选举中大捞一把。可惜，人们对于岸信介早已失掉了信任，他们不仅要听其言，而且还要观其行。岸信介的许多言论和行动恰恰证明，他对中国的态度绝不是“丝毫没有敌意和不友好的想法”，而是丝毫没有改变敌意和不友好的想法。岸信介自从悍然撕毁第四次中日贸易协定以来，从未停止对中国的污蔑和攻击，而且是越来越变本加厉。1958年10月9日，岸信介在对美国广播公司记者布朗的谈话中，公开污蔑中国是“侵略者”，把美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区对中国人民进行的军事挑衅，说成是“一场反对共产主义侵略的国际战争”。岸信介说：“为了日本的安全”，绝不能让中国人民收复自己的领土台湾。岸信介还处心积虑地要删除日本宪法中禁止战争的条款，借口“保全自由世界”，要求派兵出国，勾结美国向东南亚进行扩张。此外，岸信介政府一连几次纵容暴徒侮辱中国国旗，并且迟迟不作交代。长崎事件虽经我国人民提出严重抗议并且遭到日本舆论的强烈谴责，最后竟以宣布对暴徒“罚款五百日元”草草了事。尤其令人不能容忍的是，岸信介在长崎事件发生后，又一连纵容歹徒在横滨、东京扯下甚至当众烧毁中国国旗，至今不曾作出交代。岸信介政府还竭力跟随美国制造“两个中国”，岸信介政府一直强调什么“日本必须保持它目前同台湾国民党中国政府的外交关系”，并且说什么同中国往来必须把政治和经济分开，即贸易要谈，但政治上继续敌视中国的反动政策不能改变。最近岸信介甚至在日本国会上公然声称“由于国际信义的关系，要始终尊重台湾政府。这是日本的外交路线”。难道这些言论和行动还不足以暴露岸信介政府及它所代表的日本垄断资本的真面目吗？难道中国人民可以放任岸信介政府的敌视中国政策而非和日本进行贸易不可吗？如果岸信介把他自己这样露骨地敌视中国的言行，竟说成是出于对中国人民的“友好”，这岂不是欺人太甚？难道中国人民只有听任岸信介政府的侮辱和肆意摆布，同意他的政治和经济分开的两面三刀手法，才不算是“误解”吗？
    中国人民对于岸信介政府这种种侮辱中华人民共和国、蓄意向六亿中国人民挑衅的行为，从来是了解得十分准确的，绝不会发生误解。中国人民绝不会容忍日本帝国主义的再起，绝不会听任岸信介政府的摆布。为什么岸信介在连篇累牍地发出污蔑和攻击中国的言论之后，突然在这个时候高唱起“打开日中关系僵局”的调子、俨然扮成一个“热心”于中日贸易的角色来了呢？说来也简单：由于岸信介一味追随美帝国主义，违背日本人民的意志，对外执行潜在的帝国主义政策，对内实行法西斯统治，威胁着日本民族和亚洲各国的和平和安全，他已经遭到日本人民坚强的反击。现在，打倒岸信介内阁的声浪一天比一天响亮，日本人民要求恢复日中邦交的运动已经日益成为日本政治生活中不可忽视的强大力量，连自由民主党的有识之士也对岸信介政府发出责难。随着日本经济危机的长期化和深刻化，岸信介政府的危机已越来越严重。岸信介自己也被迫承认：“在国际上，自由阵营以不安的神色注视着我们；在国内，正当就要举行参议院选举和国会就要复会的时候，情况将变得非常难于应付”。
    由此可见，岸信介政府之所以急于做出“打开日中关系僵局”的姿态，无非是为的蒙蔽日本人民，混过眼前的政治危机。请看，当社会党议员在国会上质询政府叫喊要同中国举行会谈是不是为了应付选举的时候，岸信介政府就不敢正面回答。这不正是打中了岸信介的心病吗？其实，岸信介之所以强调“政治和经济分开”，正是出于政治上的打算。岸信介政府的藤山外相不就曾公开承认“关于召开日中两国大使会谈的发言，是大部分为了参议员选举对策的‘宣传’”吗？显而易见，尽管岸信介“嘴唇上含着微笑”或是高唱“恢复日中贸易”的调子，但是他敌视中国的立场，却丝毫没有改变。最有力的证据，就是岸信介自己说的话：“关于共产党中国的问题，我想没有必要改变政府的既往态度。”
    其实，岸信介这种两面三刀的手法，对我们来说早已不是什么新玩意了。1958年初，由于日本人民日益不满岸信介政府的政策和日本经济情况的恶化，当时解散众议院、提前举行大选的趋势已成定局，岸信介为了增加竞选的资本骗取选票，不是也曾千方百计地企图在解散众议院以前解决缔结第四次中日贸易协定的问题吗？他默许日本三团体代表团到北京来谈判和签定了贸易协定，可是，一旦骗取选票的目的已达，他就不顾一切悍然撕毁第四次贸易协定，公然破坏中日关系。岸信介这一次又想旧戏重演。岸信介还能够欺骗谁呢？既骗不了中国人民，也骗不了日本人民。只要岸信介政府不改变它对中国的敌视态度，而继续制造“两个中国”的阴谋，继续阻挠中日两国正常关系的恢复，那么，岸信介政府的花言巧语就决改变不了中国人民的坚定立场的。
    目前，岸信介政府破坏中日贸易已给日本经济、特别是日本某些中小企业造成了许多困难。对于这些中小企业由于中日贸易中断而遭到的困难处境，中国人民寄予深切同情。我们知道，岸信介政府的态度绝不代表日本人民的愿望，它的做法是注定要失败的。中国人民是愿意同日本人民友好相处的，并且一直为促进中日友好而努力。日本人民也曾积极地为增进中日两国人民的友谊而努力，并且迫切要求中日早日恢复邦交。我们相信，尽管岸信介破坏和阻挠两国正常关系的发展，尽管岸信介在中日友好的道路上设下了人为的障碍，但是经过两国人民的共同努力，中日两国人民的友好关系终究将排除一切人为障碍而继续向前发展的。
