    The Bugle Call to March Towards Communism Has Sounded
    By Our Correspondent Chen Quanbi
    During the days of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the weather in Moscow was almost always good. It was full of sunshine, as if spring was about to arrive. The thawed Moscow River sparkled in the sunlight. Looking out from the windows of the conference hall, the snow on the green fir trees was gradually melting in the warm sunlight. Comrade Khrushchev said at the last meeting of the Congress: We had the sun at the beginning of our meeting, and we have the sun again today. The sun will always shine on our progress.

    At 2:40 PM on February 5th, all the lights in the Grand Kremlin Palace were turned on, and the majestic strains of the Internationale resounded. Photographers were busily capturing the last touching moments. The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, after nine days of intense work, had solemnly concluded. Delegates and fraternal party guests left the venue one after another with excitement and emotion. The Grand Kremlin Palace was once again illuminated by the glory of this historic congress.

    At the moment of the conference's conclusion, the Congress finally adopted Comrade Khrushchev's report made at the opening of the Congress and the resolution made on this report amidst thunderous applause. For a time, the atmosphere in the venue was filled with enthusiasm. The delegates raised their red delegate passes high, and thousands of hands formed a dense forest, with thousands of eyes fixed on the rostrum. They applauded warmly and cheered enthusiastically. The delegates' excitement and emotion were closely linked to the Party's great intentions and the Party's great call to build communism. We heard so many delegates' speeches, heard so many of their bold statements! Whether they were leaders of the Party and the government, or workers and collective farmers, or office workers and scientific workers, they all unanimously praised Comrade Khrushchev's report.

    Simultaneously with the adoption of Comrade Khrushchev's report, the Congress also adopted the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan. The magnificent control figures of the Seven-Year Plan are a great program for communist construction, and also a guide for the specific actions of the Soviet people in the next seven years. For more than two months, in order to make the Seven-Year Plan more specific, more substantial, and more in line with reality, all the Soviet people have put in countless efforts, held countless meetings, and put forward countless new suggestions.

    We deeply feel that in the Soviet Seven-Year Plan, every percentage point of economic development will bring the lofty ideals of human communism closer to realization, will bring great happiness to the Soviet people, and will greatly strengthen the forces defending peace. However, those imperialist elements and bourgeois-hired rumor-mongers are desperately saying against their conscience that the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan construction is in preparation for war, and that the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan construction is being carried out at the expense of the people's interests. But these bourgeois gentlemen, please open your eyes a little bit, as long as you look at the tremendous efforts made by the Soviet Union in the Seven-Year Plan to improve the people's material and cultural well-being, your rumors are worthless. The indicators of the Seven-Year Plan point out that as a result of the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, after seven years, the Soviet people will be able to obtain an average of nearly two thousand catties of grain, more than six hundred catties of milk, nearly two hundred catties of meat, eighty-eight catties of sugar, and nearly two hundred eggs per person per year. Not to mention the efforts made by the Soviet Union in other areas. Pospelov, Alternate Member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, said it well at the meeting that it is unimaginable for a country to launch a war and at the same time carry out such large-scale peaceful construction. Mikoyan also said at the meeting on the 31st that when he was in the United States, he asked Secretary of State Dulles whether he believed in a war threat from the Soviet Union. Dulles replied that no, he didn't think so. The Soviet Seven-Year Plan is a challenge to the United States, but this challenge is a challenge of peaceful competition. The Soviet Union's magnificent Seven-Year Plan shows to all mankind that the Soviet Union does not agree to resolve international disputes by war, but advocates peaceful competition between the two systems.

    At the Congress, we saw more than once these delegates from all over the country, they are all outstanding sons and daughters of the Party, outstanding representatives of the people. They have extensive contacts with the people. They wear various national costumes, they are workers, collective farmers, scientific workers, and office workers. They stepped onto the solemn rostrum with firm steps, representing their party organizations, enterprises, and construction sites, to express their heartfelt gratitude to the CPSU Central Committee headed by Comrade Khrushchev for the glorious achievements made in leading the country's activities in recent years. On the lofty rostrum, they constantly expressed their determination, made loud voices, and made vows to the Party Central Committee and the Congress: In the face of the magnificent tasks, they must redouble their efforts and complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. We will never forget the guarantees made by Anisinkov, a steelmaking worker at the Red Sormovo Steel Plant in Gorky Oblast, Mamai, a famous miner at the Donbass No. 2 Mine, and Kovaleva, the female chairman of the "For the Motherland" Collective Farm in Belarus, at the Congress, that they would complete the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan in four or five years. Their patriotic actions were respected by all the delegates and won warm applause from all the delegates. During the Congress, the presidium of the Congress received telegrams from factories and enterprises across the country every day. They told the Congress that they had either completed their production plans, or created new products and saved a lot of funds, or discovered new resources. They assured the Congress that they would use a new attitude towards labor to welcome the closing of the Congress and the new calls issued by the Congress.

    Hundreds of Young Pioneers came to the venue. They were here to congratulate the Congress. They are the successors of the communist builders. They made many guarantees to the Congress, that they would be good sons and daughters of the Party, and that after they learn their skills, they will run to the places where the Party and the motherland need them most. They will exercise well, study hard, and strive to be comprehensively developed communist builders. When they presented hundreds of bouquets of flowers to the rostrum, the whole audience stood up and applauded warmly, expressing the Party's care and love for the young generation of the Soviet motherland.

    The delegations from seventy-two fraternal parties from all over the world, in the past nine days, in addition to making cordial congratulations to the Congress on behalf of their own parties, they have always quietly listened to the speeches of each delegate. They came to Moscow again after the declaration of the Moscow meeting of communist and workers' parties of various countries was issued. More than a year later, the development of the international situation has increasingly proved the correctness of the estimates made in the Moscow meeting declaration. We can clearly see from the speeches of the delegations of various fraternal parties that the economy is rapidly rising in various socialist countries, the people's living standards are gradually improving, and the international status is constantly consolidating. And in capitalist countries and colonial countries, their economies are facing serious crises, and the people are suffering from unemployment and the loss of human rights. In the speeches of the representatives of the fraternal parties in capitalist countries and colonial countries, it was unanimously emphasized that the existence and development of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp are the greatest encouragement and support for their struggle. The Congress has always been filled with the spirit of proletarian internationalist solidarity. It is unforgettable that when Comrade Khrushchev embraced Comrades Zhou Enlai, Ho Chi Minh, and Ulbricht one after another, the atmosphere in the venue was so warm, and it could be felt how warm, how affectionate, and how powerful our socialist family is! The speeches of the fraternal party representatives unanimously pointed out that proletarian internationalist solidarity is the fundamental guarantee for the cause of human progress. They unanimously condemned the behavior of the Yugoslav revisionists in betraying the interests of the working class.

    The 21st Congress of the CPSU has successfully concluded. This is a congress of communist builders, and also a congress where communist builders pledged to march towards communism. Although the time of this meeting was very short, the Congress was an extremely important political event in Soviet history and in the cause of human progress. This meeting opened a new construction period in the Soviet Union, that is, a period of comprehensively launching communist construction. In this period, the Soviet economy will rise to new heights, the Soviet people's living standards will be closer to the communist living standards, and the Soviet people's moral character will be further improved. After seven years, the Soviet Union will be more powerful and invincible. After the successful completion of the Seven-Year Plan, the balance of power on the world political stage will undergo even greater changes, and socialist and communist ideas will be more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The bugle call to march towards communism has sounded, and the great and heroic Soviet people have taken steps forward towards communism! Let the imperialist war provocateurs tremble in the face of the peaceful will of the Soviet people and the peace-loving people of the world!

    向共产主义进军的号角响了
    本报记者　陈泉璧
    在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会进行的日子里，莫斯科的天气差不多每天都很好。这里到处充满阳光，好似春天就要来到。已经解冻了的莫斯科河，在阳光下闪闪发光。从会议大厅的窗口向外看去，绿色枞树上的积雪，也在温暖的阳光下逐渐溶解。赫鲁晓夫同志在代表大会的末次会议上说：我们会议一开始的时候就有太阳，今天又是太阳，太阳永远照耀着我们前进。
    5日下午二时四十分，大克里姆林宫会议大厅里灯光齐明，响起雄壮的国际歌的歌声。摄影师们在紧张地摄下最后一个动人的镜头。苏共第二十一次代表大会，在经过紧张的九天的工作以后，已经隆重闭幕。代表们和兄弟党贵宾们，怀着兴奋和激动的心情，陆续地退出会场。由于这个历史性的代表大会的召开，大克里姆林宫会议大厅又一次增添了光彩。
    在会议结束的瞬间，代表大会最后在雷动的掌声中，通过了赫鲁晓夫同志在代表大会开幕时所作的报告和就这个报告所作出的决议。一时会场里充满了热烈的气氛。代表们高高地举起红色的代表证，几千双手接成一座丛密的树林，几千双眼睛注视着主席台。他们热烈鼓掌，热烈欢呼。代表们兴奋和激动的心情，已经和党的伟大意图、党的建设共产主义的伟大号召紧密地结合起来了。我们听到了多少代表的发言，听到他们多少的豪言壮语！无论是党和政府的领导人，无论是工人和集体农民，也无论是机关工作人员和科学工作者，他们都一致地赞扬赫鲁晓夫同志的报告。
    与通过赫鲁晓夫同志的报告的同时，大会一起通过了七年计划的控制数字。雄伟的七年计划控制数字是一个伟大的共产主义建设的纲领，也是苏联人民在今后七年中具体行动的指南。两个多月来为了使七年计划订得更具体、更充实、更加符合实际，全体苏联人民，不知费尽了多少心计，开过了多少会议，提出了多少新的建议。
    我们深刻地感觉到在苏联七年计划中，经济发展的每一个百分数的增长，都会使人类的共产主义的崇高理想更加接近实现，都会带给苏联人民极大的幸福，并将使捍卫和平的力量大大加强。但是，那些帝国主义分子和资产阶级御用的造谣家们，他们却一味抹煞良心说苏联进行七年计划的建设是为着准备战争，说苏联进行七年计划的建设是在牺牲人民利益的条件下进行的。但是这些资产阶级的老爷们，请你们把眼睛稍稍睁开一下，只要你们看一看苏联在七年计划中对改善人民物质和文化福利所作的巨大努力，你们的造谣一个钱也不值了。七年计划的指标指出，由于发展农业和畜牧业的结果，苏联人民在七年后，每人每年平均可以得到将近二千市斤的粮食，六百多市斤的牛奶，将近二百市斤的肉类，八十八市斤砂糖和将近二百个鸡蛋。苏联在其它方面所作的努力更不用说了。苏共中央主席团候补委员波斯别洛夫在会上说得好，假使一个国家真要发动战争，而同时又要进行这么大规模的和平建设，那是不可想像的。米高扬在31日的大会上也说，他在美国时曾问过杜勒斯国务卿，他是否相信来自苏联方面的战争威胁。杜勒斯回答说，不，他不这样想。苏联的七年计划是向美国进行挑战，但这种挑战是和平竞赛的挑战。苏联雄伟的七年计划向一切人类表明，苏联不赞成用战争的方法来解决国际争端，而是主张在两个制度间进行和平竞赛。
    我们在代表大会上不止一次地看到这一些来自全国各地的代表们，他们都是党的优秀儿女，人民的杰出的代表。他们和人民有着广泛的联系。他们穿着各色民族服装，他们是工人、集体农民、科学工作者、机关工作人员。他们迈着刚毅的步伐，登上庄严的主席台，代表自己的党组织、企业和工地，向以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏共中央在近年来领导国家活动中所取得的光辉成就表示衷心的感谢。他们在崇高的讲台上，不断地表示自己的决心，发出宏亮的声音，向党中央，向代表大会发出誓言：他们在雄伟的任务面前，一定要加倍努力，提前完成七年计划。我们永远不能忘记高尔基州红色索尔莫沃钢铁厂炼钢工人阿尼辛科夫、顿巴斯二号矿井著名矿工马马伊、白俄罗斯“为了祖国”集体农庄女主席科瓦列娃在大会上所作的保证，他们要在四、五年内完成七年计划的任务。他们这种爱国主义的行为，受到全体代表的尊敬，博得全体代表的热烈鼓掌。在大会进行期间，大会主席团每天都接到来自全国各工厂和企业的电报。他们告诉代表大会，他们或者完成了生产计划，或者创造了新产品和节约了大量资金，或者发现了新的资源。他们向代表大会保证，要用新的劳动态度，来迎接代表大会的闭幕和代表大会发出的新的号召。
    成百名的少先队员来到了会场。他们是来向代表大会祝贺的。他们是共产主义建设者的后继者。他们向代表大会提出了许多保证，他们要做党的好儿女，他们学会本领后，要跑到党和祖国最需要的地方去。他们要好好锻炼身体，努力学习，争取作一个全面发展的共产主义建设者。当他们把成百束鲜花送上主席台时，全场起立，热烈鼓掌，表示了党对苏维埃祖国年青一代的关怀和爱护。
    来自世界各地的七十二个兄弟党的代表团，在过去九天中，除了代表自己的党向大会作了亲切的祝贺外，他们始终都静静地听取着每个代表的发言。他们在各国共产党和工人党莫斯科代表会议宣言发表后又一次来到了莫斯科。时隔一年多，国际局势的发展，越来越证明莫斯科会议宣言所估计的正确。我们从各兄弟党代表团的发言中清楚地看到，在各社会主义国家里经济正在急剧高涨，人民生活水平正在逐步提高，国际地位正在不断巩固。而在资本主义国家和殖民地国家中，他们的经济面临着严重的危机，人民正在遭受着失业和丧失人权的痛苦。资本主义国家和殖民地国家的兄弟党的代表发言中，一致强调，苏联和社会主义阵营的存在和发展，是他们进行斗争的最大的鼓舞和支持的力量。代表大会始终洋溢着无产阶级国际主义团结的精神。令人难忘的是，当赫鲁晓夫同志先后同周恩来、胡志明和乌布利希等同志拥抱时，会场的气氛是那样的热烈，可以感到我们社会主义大家庭是多么温暖，多么亲热，多么有力量！兄弟党代表的发言中都一致指出，无产阶级国际主义的团结是人类进步事业的根本保证。他们一致谴责了南斯拉夫修正主义者背叛工人阶级利益的行为。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会胜利闭幕了。这是共产主义建设者的大会，也是共产主义建设者誓师向共产主义进军的大会，这次会议的时间虽然很短，但是，代表大会是苏联历史上和人类进步事业中一个极其重要的政治事件。这次会议揭开了苏联一个新的建设时期，即全面展开共产主义建设的时期。在这个时期里，苏联经济将要升到新的高峰，苏联人民生活水平将要更加接近共产主义的生活水平，苏联人民的道德品质将更加提高。七年后，苏联将更加强大和不可战胜。七年计划胜利完成后，世界政治舞台力量的对比将要发生更大的变化，社会主义和共产主义思想将要更加深入人心。向共产主义进军的号角响了，伟大英勇的苏联人民已经向共产主义迈步前进！让帝国主义战争挑衅者在苏联人民和全世界爱好和平人民的和平意志面前发抖吧！
