    Red Flag and Enthusiasm
    Zeng Zhi
    Not long ago, a debate unfolded in the Bali Brigade of the Nanbai Commune in Zunyi City, Guizhou. The focus of the debate was whether or not to have red flag competitions? Whether to raise the red flag or roll it up? Some people said that the red flag is just a piece of cloth, a paper flag, what is the point of competing for it, what is so rare about winning it! However, the vast majority of people disagreed with this view. They said that if the ideology is red, then the flag will be red; if the heart is red, the flag is red, then production will be energetic.
    Obviously, those who say that the red flag is just a piece of cloth, a paper flag, only see the superficial image of the red flag, and do not see the essential meaning of the red flag; they only see the form, and do not see its profound content. The vast majority of people do not see the problem in this way. They not only see the image of the red flag, but also deeply recognize the significance of the red flag competition, and understand the relationship between the red flag and enthusiasm.
    What does "ideology is red, then the flag will be red; if the heart is red, the flag is red, then production will be energetic" mean? According to the actual situation of the red flag competition carried out in the Great Leap Forward last year, it is probably like this: a person must be ideologically advanced and highly conscious to be able to plant a red flag; a person who plants a red flag must have a fiery heart; with a fiery heart, there will be soaring enthusiasm, and production will be lively and vigorous. This also applies to a team or a commune.
    It can be seen that, in the eyes of the vast majority of people, the red flag is closely related to enthusiasm, and enthusiasm is closely related to whether production is doing well or not. They do not roll up the red flag, but raise it.
    Yes, raise the red flag! Countless facts last year have proven that wherever the red flag is flying, there is soaring enthusiasm. The red flag has greatly inspired people's enthusiasm and motivated their ambition to strive for the top and strive for the first. In order to compete for the red flag, people have launched a wave of "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced"; in order to compete for the red flag, people are carrying out selfless hard work on all production fronts. After the Bali Brigade launched the red flag competition, it plowed more than 3,100 mu of terrace fields in just ten days; while in the longer period before that, it only plowed more than 600 mu. This is the best explanation of the role played by the red flag.
    Let the red flag be raised higher in this year's production campaign, and let the red flag fly everywhere in the wind on our vast land, hills, and construction sites!

    红旗和干劲
    曾志
    不久以前，在贵州遵义市南白公社八里大队，展开了一场争论。争论的焦点是要不要红旗竞赛？把红旗打起来还是卷起来？有人说，红旗是块方布，是纸旗旗，何必争，争来有什么稀奇！但是，绝大多数人不同意这种看法。他们说，思想红，旗才红，心红、旗红生产才有劲。
    显然，说红旗是块方布，是纸旗旗的人，是只看到了红旗的表面形象，而没有看到红旗的本质含义；是只看到了形式，而没有看到它的深刻的内容。绝大多数人呢，不是这样看问题的。他们不但看到了红旗的形象，更深刻地认识到了红旗竞赛的意义，体会到红旗和干劲的关系。
    他们所说的“思想红，旗才红，心红、旗红生产才有劲”是什么意思呢？按照去年大跃进中开展红旗竞赛的实际情况看来，大约是这样的：一个人要思想进步、觉悟高，才能插红旗；插红旗的人，一定有一颗火热的心；有了火热的心，才会有冲天的干劲，生产才会搞得热热闹闹、轰轰烈烈。推而至于一个队、一个社也是如此。
    可见，在绝大多数人的眼里，红旗和干劲、干劲和生产搞得好不好是紧密相关的。他们不是把红旗卷起来，而是要把红旗打起来。
    对，要把红旗打起来！去年数不清的事实已经证明：哪里红旗招展，哪里干劲冲天。红旗大大鼓舞了人们的干劲，激励了人们争上游、争第一的雄心。为了争红旗，人们掀起了“学先进、赶先进、超先进”的热潮；为了争红旗，人们在一切生产战线上，进行着忘我的苦战。八里大队在开展了红旗竞赛以后，仅仅十天工夫，就犁了板田三千一百多亩；而在那以前较长的时间里，却只犁了六百多亩。这就是红旗所起的作用的最好说明。
    让红旗在今年的生产运动中举得更高，让红旗在我们辽阔的大地上、山岗上、工地上处处迎风飘扬吧！
