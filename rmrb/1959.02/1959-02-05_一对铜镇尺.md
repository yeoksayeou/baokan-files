A Pair of Copper Paperweights

In the Changxindian Locomotive Factory, there's a veteran worker named Liu Yongnian, who has been working at the factory for thirty years. He's experienced, skilled, and loves to research without saying much. Because the Great Leap Forward required building internal combustion locomotives, a problem arose in the process of turning the axles. The lathes in the workshop were not enough, and the leadership called for technical reforms and more research.

For this axle turning task, he had been planning for days. He remembered an old broken lathe from before liberation, which had been lying in the scrap heap. Although the lathe was old and broken, it could still contribute if repaired.

One day, after work, Master Liu hurried to the scrap heap. He didn't mind the metal shavings piercing his hands, nor the sweat soaking his clothes. He moved a pile of scrap copper and iron, and sure enough, the lathe was lying before him. He touched the lathe and muttered to himself: "Old pal, this time you'll turn over and see the light of day. The great effort to build internal combustion locomotives needs you to show your skills. Don't underestimate this old lathe, it's still extraordinary."

The next morning, he met with the director and talked about his idea of using waste materials. The director nodded repeatedly: "I will support you with any difficulties." He immediately called a few people, along with two apprentices and a technician. Before long, the lathe was transported into the workshop, and the technician was busy checking if all the parts were complete. It was discovered that two yellow brass dust covers were missing, and the materials department didn't have enough in stock either.

The technician and the apprentices were at a loss, but Master Liu said to his apprentices: "You two help the technician install all the gears, I'll go out for a while and be right back."

Master Liu walked out of the factory gate, taking big strides, running and hurrying, feeling anxious and walking fast, unknowingly arriving at his doorstep. Aunt Liu was rolling dough in the house when she looked up and saw Lao Liu returning home. "Your face isn't washed today, and your clothes aren't changed, why are you off work so early? Looks like you're sick, maybe you caught a cold last night."

Lao Liu stammered a few words, took off his shoes, got on the kang, and moved a chest. Lao Liu rummaged through the chest, making a mess. Auntie, seeing this, was annoyed. "What are you looking for? I'll help you find it. You're making a mess on purpose to give me trouble!"

Lao Liu didn't say anything and continued to search, rummaging through the chest and then the cabinet. Suddenly, Lao Liu shouted, "Where are you running!" Aunt Liu quickly came to Lao Liu's side. "Are there mice in the cabinet? No wonder it's been squeaking and gnawing so much these days."

Lao Liu said, "These two mice are a pair, and in my hands, they'll turn into treasures. I've been searching for so long just for this pair of copper paperweights, it's made me sweat all over. They are small but very useful, taking them to the factory will solve a big problem."

Speaking of this pair of copper paperweights, they have been a family heirloom in the Liu family for over a hundred years. Antique dealers have offered a price, a pair can be exchanged for a bag of flour.

The technician and apprentices were talking about him, when they saw Master Liu returning with the paperweights in his hand. Master Liu said, "Our key problem has been solved, no need for everyone to worry."

The three of them asked Master Liu together: "Where did you buy the paperweights and how much did they cost?"

Master Liu said: "These things are worth quite a bit, but I didn't spend a penny. They will be perfect as dust covers, these are our family's ancient heirlooms."

Then he compared the paperweights to the lathe, not too long, not too short, not too wide.

All the work was prepared, the axle was installed, and the test began. The director and secretary also came to watch, and the workers gathered around. Master Liu ran the lathe fast, and before long, a new axle appeared.

Instantly, the workshop was filled with applause. Everyone raised Master Liu to congratulate Liu Yongnian. The director said: "This time our task is guaranteed, the large axle for the internal combustion locomotive will definitely be completed ahead of schedule. Master Liu is our good example, daring to think, daring to do, and diligently researching. Everyone must run ahead."

    一对铜镇尺
    长辛店机车厂工人　赵崇祐　张铁桥有一位老师傅叫刘永年，在工厂里干了三十年；经验丰富手艺好，不言不语爱钻研。只因为大跃进要把内燃机车造，旋车轴的工序出了困难。车间里的旋床不够用，领导上号召改革技术多钻研。就为这件旋轴的事，前几天他心里就打了算盘：想起来解放前的一台破旋床，一直扔在了烂铁堆里边，虽然说这台床子老又破，修理一下还能有贡献。这一天，刘师傅下了班，急忙忙来到废铁堆跟前。顾不得铁刨花扎破了手，顾不得出汗湿透他的衣衫，搬开一堆废铜铁，果然床子就躺在他眼前，手摸床子自言又自语：“老伙计，这回翻身见了青天，大干内燃机车要你显身手，别看老掉牙的床子也不平凡。”第二天一早他见了主任，把他利用废料的主张谈。主任听了不住把头点：“有什么困难我支援。”当下叫来人几个，还有两个徒弟和技术员。不多时把床子运进车间内，技术员忙检查零件全不全。发现缺少两块黄铜防尘板，材料科里也货不全。技术员和徒弟们都没有主意，刘师傅对着徒弟开了言：“你俩帮着技术员把齿轮都安好，我出去一趟马上就回还。”刘师傅走出了工厂门，迈开大步连跑还带颠，心急如火走的快，不觉来到家门前。刘大娘正在屋里来擀面，抬头看见老刘把家还，“你今天脸没洗衣裳也没换，为甚么这么早就下了班？看样子是不是有了病，想必是昨天晚上受了风寒。”老刘支支吾吾说了两句话，脱鞋上炕就把箱子搬。老刘把箱子里的东西翻得乱，大娘一见好心烦，“找什么东西我来给你找，翻得乱七八糟诚心给我找麻烦！”老刘不吭声继续来寻找，翻完箱子又把柜来翻。忽听老刘喊了一声“哪里跑！”大娘急忙来到老刘跟前，“是不是柜子里有老鼠？怪不得这两天唧吱咯吱咬得欢。”老刘说：“这两个老鼠是一对，到了我手就把宝贝变。找了半天就为了这对铜镇尺，折腾我出了一身汗，东西小来用处大，拿进厂里解决大关键。”提起这对铜镇尺，刘家祖传已经百余年；古董商人出过价，一对能换一袋面。技术员和徒弟正在把他来叨念，看见刘师傅手拿镇尺转回还。刘师傅说：“咱们的关键已经解决了，用不着大家再为难。”三人一齐把刘师傅问：“哪里买来镇尺用了多少钱？”刘师傅说：“这东西值钱可不少，可是我没花一分钱，拿它当防尘板准合适，这本是我们家传的老古玩。”接着就把镇尺往床子上比了比，不长不短也不宽。一切工作准备好，上好车轴就试验，主任支书也来看，工人围了一大圈。刘师傅把车开得飞又快，不多时一根新轴出现在眼前，霎时车间一片掌声响，大家抬起老师傅祝贺刘永年，主任说：“这回咱们的任务有保证，内燃机车的大轴一定提前完。刘师傅就是我们的好榜样，敢想敢干苦心钻研大家都要跑在前。”
