Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 5th. TASS reported: At a press conference held by US President Eisenhower on the 4th, he was asked many questions about the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In answering these questions, Eisenhower made no mention of the part of Khrushchev's report at the Congress which expressed the Soviet Union's sincere hope to stop the "Cold War", ease international tensions, and free mankind from the fear of new war dangers. He said that he saw nothing in Khrushchev's report that offered "any new hope to the free world." The President did not abandon the terminology of the "Cold War." He said that the West should, as before, formulate plans that might be acceptable to the Soviet Union in order to "pry open a gap in the Iron Curtain."

The President commented in a noticeably agitated tone on Malinowski's speech at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The President called Malinowski's statement that the Soviet Union possessed intercontinental missiles capable of defeating aggressors anywhere on Earth a "propagandistic" statement.

In this regard, Eisenhower also tried his best to brag about the American military machine.

Finally, Eisenhower considered it justified that the captain of the American guard refused to allow the Soviet checkpoint on the border between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to inspect the American guard troops (convoys of guards entering the German Democratic Republic).

    对苏共代表大会和平之声充耳不闻
    艾森豪威尔犹弹冷战旧调
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿讯：在美国总统艾森豪威尔4日举行的记者招待会上，有人对他提出许多有关苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的问题。在回答这些问题时，艾森豪威尔对赫鲁晓夫在代表大会上所作报告中表示苏联真诚希望停止“冷战”、缓和国际紧张局势和使人类摆脱对新战争危险的恐惧这一部分只字不提。他说，他在赫鲁晓夫的报告中丝毫看不到给“自由世界提供任何新的希望”。总统没有丢掉“冷战”的术语。他说，西方应该和从前一样制订有可能为苏联所接受的计划，以便“从铁幕中冲开缺口”。
    总统以明显激动的声调评述了马利诺夫斯基在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会上的发言。总统把马利诺夫斯基说到苏联拥有能够击败地球上任何地方的侵略者的洲际导弹这一句话称为“宣传性”的声明。
    在这方面，艾森豪威尔还尽力吹嘘美国的军事机器。
    最后，艾森豪威尔认为美国警卫队队长拒绝让在德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国边境线上的苏联检查岗检查（警卫进入德意志民主共和国的车队的）美国警卫部队这一举动是正当的。
