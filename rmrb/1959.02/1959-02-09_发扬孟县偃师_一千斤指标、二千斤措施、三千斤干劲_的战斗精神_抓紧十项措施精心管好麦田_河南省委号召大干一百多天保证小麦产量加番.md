This Dispatch from Zhengzhou, February 8th: "Make a great effort for over a hundred days, guarantee a doubling of wheat yield per mu, and strive for one season to equal one year!" This is the battle cry put forward by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at the on-site wheat field management conference held in Meng County and Yanshi County. To ensure the completion of this combat mission, Henan Province has decided to adopt ten specific measures to strengthen wheat field management.

Meng County and Yanshi County are high-yield wheat counties in Henan Province for many years. This year, both counties have put forward ambitious plans to break through the 1,000 jin per mu mark for wheat yield in the entire county. Meng County plans to guarantee a yield of 1,000 jin per mu and strive for 1,200 jin; Yanshi County guarantees a yield of 1,200 jin per mu and strives for 2,000 jin. Since wheat was sown last year, the people of the two counties, under the slogan of "1,000 jin target, 2,000 jin measures, 3,000 jin drive," have conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and have paid special attention to "fertilizer taking the lead." Through vigorously increasing the application of base fertilizer and topdressing to wheat fields, they have promoted the entire wheat field management work. While constantly carrying out wheat seedling alignment, earnestly strengthening the management of general wheat fields, and continuously improving and eliminating Class III seedlings, they have also vigorously developed large areas of contiguous high-yield fields of several thousand mu or tens of thousands of mu. At present, the wheat seedlings in both counties are growing very well. According to inspections, the 300,000 mu of wheat fields in Meng County now generally have about three tillers per plant, of which 72,000 mu of "satellite fields" have about 1.5 million tillers per mu, and 110,000 mu of large-area high-yield fields have more than 1 million tillers per mu. The 460,000 mu of wheat in Yanshi County now also have an average of three tillers per plant, with an average of more than 900,000 tillers per mu.

The conference exchanged and promoted the advanced experience of wheat field management in Meng County, Yanshi, and other places. Based on the characteristics of early sowing, good sowing, good field management, and abundant seedlings, vigorous seedlings, and deep roots in most wheat fields throughout the province this year, it put forward three requirements and ten measures to strive for a greater wheat harvest. The three requirements are: 1. Make a great effort for four months to guarantee a doubling of wheat yield per mu and strive for one season to equal one year. 2. Launch a large-scale high-yield wheat movement. It is required that in advanced counties, the area of high-yield wheat fields should account for 30% of the total wheat sowing area, 20% in general counties, and at least 15% in the counties with the worst conditions. The planned yield of these high-yield fields must be more than double the local planned guaranteed yield. 3. Conscientiously strengthen wheat field management to achieve more heads, larger ears, and fuller grains. The next month is the key month to determine wheat tillering, so it is necessary to carefully process and fertilize to avoid losing heads or losing fewer heads. General wheat fields require 400,000 plants per mu, high-yield fields reach 1 million plants, and "satellite" fields reach 2 million plants per mu, with an average of about 30 grains per ear.

To ensure the realization of the above three requirements, the following ten measures must be taken:

1. With fertilizer taking the lead, we must work hard for one month, maintaining a participation of 10 million people in manure accumulation every day, with an average of 1,000 jin of manure accumulated per person per day. Ensure that wheat fields are well-fed, requiring general wheat fields to be fertilized with 50,000 jin of coarse manure per mu, and satellite fields with 100,000 jin. Coarse manure must be applied fully before the end of February and the beginning of March. After jointing, apply soil-based fertilizer once or twice more.

2. Give full play to the irrigation benefits of existing water conservancy projects to ensure that wheat seedlings are well-watered. At present, water conservancy construction and manure accumulation should be combined into one effort, vigorously repairing field projects, adding water conservancy tools, and ensuring that 55 million mu of winter-irrigated wheat is completed by the end of February and 70 million mu of spring-irrigated wheat is completed by the end of March.

3. Counties and communes should all establish high-yield plots, creating large plots within small plots, with satellites in every plot, and the advanced leading the backward. When delineating plots, the boundaries of counties, communes, and teams can be broken, unified command and mutual cooperation implemented, and designated personnel assigned to be responsible. Regular meetings should be held to conduct inspections and evaluations, disseminate advanced experiences, and carry out competitions.

4. Strengthen fertilization, eliminate Class III seedlings, and transform medium and low-grade wheat into medium and high-grade wheat. According to the alignment data in various places, medium and low-grade wheat currently accounts for about 20% to 30% of the total spring sowing area in the province. Counties, communes, and teams should conduct a general inspection to ensure that no plot is missed, formulate specific measures, assign special personnel to manage, and eliminate them within a time limit, requiring significant changes before the end of February.

5. Strengthen the management of summer miscellaneous crops, treating them as equally important as wheat, and pay special attention to strengthening the management of rapeseed. In concentrated rapeseed production areas, like wheat, plots should be delineated for management, with designated personnel responsible, and special on-site meetings on rapeseed field management should be held.

6. Conscientiously do a good job in wheat field cultivation, weeding, harrowing, rolling, and loosening the soil to conserve moisture, ensuring that there are no weeds or soil crusting.

7. Do a good job in "five preventions" - preventing insects, diseases, frost, lodging, and wind and sand. Preparations for the prevention and control of wheat sucking insects should be made as early as possible. High-yield plots should pay special attention to preventing lodging. The main methods are preventive measures, and by applying fertilizer and water rationally, the wheat stalks are made hard and thick.

8. Vigorously carry out tool reform to further improve labor efficiency.

9. Do a good job in agricultural scientific research. High-yield plots should generally establish archives, ensuring that there is a technical training station for every thousand mu, a local expert for every hundred mu, and a technician for every ten mu; and through research and experimentation, gradually grasp the laws of wheat production. Do a good job in seed fields to cultivate and test new varieties.

10. Conscientiously strengthen leadership, with designated personnel responsible at all levels from top to bottom, working to the end, consistently from beginning to end; widely use methods of holding on-site meetings and organizing visits and evaluations to promptly promote advanced experience; and also rationally use and arrange labor. In the organization of labor, there should be both professional teams and well-organized and tightly knit mass wheat field management blitz campaigns to ensure that all field management activities are not delayed.

The conference was held from January 31st to February 5th. More than 500 people attended the meeting, including agricultural secretaries of local, municipal, and county party committees, and some commune party committee secretaries. (Attached picture)

    发扬孟县偃师“一千斤指标、二千斤措施、三千斤干劲”的战斗精神
    抓紧十项措施精心管好麦田
    河南省委号召大干一百多天保证小麦产量加番
    本报郑州8日电　“大干一百多天，保证小麦产量翻一番，力争
  一季抵一年”，这是中共河南省委在孟县、偃师召开的麦田管理现场会议上提出的战斗口号。为了保证完成这个战斗任务，河南省决定采取加强麦田管理的十项具体措施。
    孟县、偃师是河南省历年的小麦高产县。今年这两个县都提出了要在全县突破亩产小麦一千斤大关的豪迈计划。孟县计划保证亩产一千斤，争取一千二百斤；偃师县保证亩产一千二百斤，争取两千斤。从去年小麦播种以来，两县人民在“一千斤的指标，两千斤的措施，三千斤的干劲”的口号下，认真执行了农业“八字宪法”，并且特别注意了以“肥料挂帅”，通过大力增施麦田底肥和追肥，促进整个麦田管理工作；在不断进行麦苗站队，认真加强对一般麦田的管理，不断提高和消灭三类麦苗的同时，大搞几千亩或上万亩连片的丰产方。现在，两县的麦苗生长都十分良好。据检查，孟县全县三十万亩麦田，现在一般每株分蘖三个左右，其中七万二千亩“卫星田”每亩分蘖达一百五十万个左右，十一万亩大面积丰产田每亩分蘖达一百万个以上。偃师县的四十六万亩小麦，现在每株也平均分蘖三个，每亩平均在九十万个以上。
    这次会议交流和推广了孟县、偃师等地麦田管理的先进经验。并且根据今年全省小麦种得早、种得好、田间管理好和绝大部分麦田苗多、苗旺、根深的特点，提出了力争小麦更大丰收的三项要求和十项措施。这三项要求是：一、大干四个月，保证小麦亩产加一番，争取一季抵一年。二、开展小麦大面积丰产运动。要求先进县小麦丰产田面积占麦播总面积的30％，一般县的丰产田达到20％，条件最差的县也要达到15％。这类丰产田的计划产量一定要超过当地计划的保证产量的一倍以上。三、认真加强麦田管理，作到头多、穗大、粒饱。最近一个月是决定小麦分蘖的关键月，必须认真加工施肥，作到不丢头或少丢头。一般麦田要求每亩四十万株，丰产田达到一百万株，“卫星”田每亩达到二百万株，每穗平均三十粒籽左右。
    为保证实现上述三个要求，要抓紧以下十项措施：
    一、以肥料挂帅，当前要狠狠地抓一个月，每天保持参加积肥的要有一千万人，平均每人每天积肥一千斤。保证麦田吃饱，要求一般麦田每亩施粗肥五万斤，卫星田十万斤。在2月底3月初以前把粗肥施完施足。拔节后，再施一次到两次土化肥。
    二、充分发挥现有水利工程的灌溉效益，保证麦苗喝足。当前要把兴修水利与积肥拧成一股绳，大力整修田间工程，添补水利工具，保证2月底完成冬浇小麦五千五百万亩，3月底春浇小麦七千万亩。
    三、县县社社搞丰产方，作到大方套小方，方方有卫星，先进带落后。划方时也可打破县、社、队的界限，统一指挥，互相协作，固定专人负责。并定期开会，进行检查评比，传播先进经验，开展竞赛。
    四、加强施肥，消灭三类苗，变中下等小麦为中上。根据各地站队材料，目前全省中下等小麦约占春播总面积的20％到30％。县、社、队要普遍进行一次检查，作到块块不漏，订出具体措施，确定专人管理，限期消灭，要求到2月底以前有显著转变。
    五、加强对夏杂作物管理，要和小麦平起平坐，对油菜要特别注意加强管理。在油菜集中产区，要像对小麦一样，划方管理，专人管理，并召开专门的油菜田间管理的现场会议。
    六、认真作好麦田中耕除草耙耱、镇压与松土保墒等工作，作到地无杂草，无板结。
    七、作好防虫、防病、防霜冻、倒伏和防风沙等“五防”，对小麦吸浆虫要及早作好防治准备。丰产方要特别注意防止倒伏。方法主要是事先预防、通过合理施肥加水，使麦棵秆硬秆粗。
    八、大搞工具改革，进一步提高劳动效率。
    九、搞好农业科学试验研究工作。丰产方要普遍建立档案，作到每一千亩有技术传授站，每一百亩有土专家，十亩有技术员；并要通过研究试验，逐渐掌握小麦生产规律。要搞好种子田，培育与试验新品种。
    十、认真加强领导，由上到下，层层都要有专人负责，作到一抓到底，有始有终；广泛运用召开现场会议和组织参观评比的方法，及时推广先进经验；还要合理使用与安排劳动力，在劳动力的组织上，要既有专业队，又要有组织得合理而严密的群众性麦田管理的突击运动，以保证各项田间管理活动不误农时。
  这次会议是在1月31日到2月5日召开的。参加会议的有各地、市、县委农业书记及一部分公社党委书记等五百多人。（附图片）
