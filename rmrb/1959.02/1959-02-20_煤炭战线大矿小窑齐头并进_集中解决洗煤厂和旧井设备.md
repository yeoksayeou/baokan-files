Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The Ministry of Coal Industry held a telephone conference on the 13th to formulate measures to solve problems in coal production increase.

The meeting analyzed that this year's coal output will increase by 110 million tons compared to last year, of which enterprises directly under the Ministry of Coal Industry will increase production by nearly 100 million tons. Of this 100 million tons of coal, 80 million tons will be completed by old mines and mines put into production last year, while the supply of equipment for these mines currently faces some difficulties. Based on this situation, the meeting decided that all enterprises should first equip the old mines and mines put into production last year (including coal washing plants) with the equipment they received in the first quarter, regardless of whether it is for production or capital construction; and secondly, use it for new mines that can be put into production this year. Therefore, old mining areas should set up fewer new projects in the first and second quarters and concentrate their efforts on solving the equipment and materials needed for coal washing plants and old mines. The meeting required that the mines to be put into production this year should immediately mobilize manpower and material resources to complete the 850-kilometer railway special line to be built by the Ministry of Coal Industry in the first half of the year, so as to produce coal as soon as possible; for the nearly 800-kilometer railway special line that is being prepared for construction, the roadbed culverts should also be built first, so that rails can be laid as soon as they arrive.

Regarding the issue of small coal pits, the meeting believed that, on a national scale, the coal industry must continue to implement the policy of walking on two legs. Only by simultaneously developing large, medium, and small-scale operations and combining indigenous and foreign methods can we achieve the victory of producing 380 million tons of coal. Coal industry bureaus (departments) of all provinces and cities must carry out good transformation of small coal pits and help them solve some difficulties that can be solved. However, those located in places around old mines with inconvenient transportation should no longer be developed.

The meeting emphasized that this year's production task is very arduous. At present, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to launch a vigorous technical revolution. Leading cadres must go deep into the grassroots, participate in labor, and promptly discover and solve problems in the masses' ideology, production, and life. (Attached picture)

### 煤炭战线大矿小窑齐头并进  集中解决洗煤厂和旧井设备

    煤炭战线大矿小窑齐头并进
    集中解决洗煤厂和旧井设备
    新华社19日讯　煤炭工业部13日召开电话会议，制定措施，解决煤炭增产中的问题。
    会议分析，今年煤炭产量比去年增加一亿一千万吨，其中原来煤炭工业部所属企业就要增产将近一亿吨。这一亿吨煤中有八千万吨是靠旧矿井和去年新投入生产的矿井来完成，而这些矿井的器材供应目前存在着一些困难。根据这个情况，会议决定，各企业应把第一季度拿到的器材，不论是生产用的还是基本建设用的，首先装备旧井和去年新投入生产的矿井（包括选煤厂）；其次才用于今年能投入生产的新井。因此，老矿区在一二季度内应少摆些新摊子，集中力量解决洗煤厂和旧矿井所需要的设备材料。会议要求今年将投入生产的矿井，应即刻动员人力物力，将煤炭部负责修建的八百五十公里的铁路专用线在上半年建成，以便早日出煤；对正准备修建的近八百公里的铁路专用线，也要先修建好路基涵洞，以便钢轨一到，就能铺轨。
    关于小煤窑的问题，会议认为，就全国说来，煤炭工业还必须贯彻两条腿走路的方针，只有大中小并举，土洋并举，才能取得生产三亿八千万吨煤的胜利。各省市煤炭工业管理局（厅）对小煤窑必须进行很好的改造，帮助他们解决一些可能解决的困难。但那些在老矿周围交通不方便的地方，就不要再继续发展。
    会议强调指出，今年的生产任务是很艰巨的。目前必须发动群众大闹技术革命。领导干部必须深入下层，参加劳动，及时发现和解决群众思想、生产和生活上的问题。（附图片）
