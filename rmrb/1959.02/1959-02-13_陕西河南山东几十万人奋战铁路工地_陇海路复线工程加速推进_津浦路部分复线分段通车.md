Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 12th. Under the leadership of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, tens of thousands of railway workers and laborers are working hard to build the double-track Longhai Railway. Currently, the Tongguan to Lintong section is under intense construction; on the Xi'an to Baoji section, over 1,690,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work for the roadbed and 45 bridge and culvert projects have been completed.

During the construction process, railway workers and laborers launched a technical innovation movement, overcoming severe cold weather and other difficulties, ensuring the smooth progress of the project. Railway workers building the Guocun Tunnel first heated the sand and gravel when pouring concrete, then mixed it with 50-degree hot water, overcoming the severe cold and creating a new record of 6.3 meters of excavation in eight hours. Railway workers fighting on the Weihe River Bridge used various methods to solve the problem of foundation pit collapse, completing 165 cubic meters of concrete pouring in just eight hours, 16 hours ahead of schedule. The vast number of laborers in Weinan, Lintong counties, and Xianyang City created advanced tools such as automatic tampers, soil trains, and single-wheel soil transport vehicles, which played a significant role in reducing the physical labor of the laborers and improving work efficiency.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, February 12th. The upsurge of the whole Party and the entire people building railways in Henan Province is flourishing. Since the construction of the double-track Jingguang Railway Zheng (Zhengzhou) Li (Lijiazhai) line began in August last year, the Miao (Miaogou) Xi (Xiyukou) double-track line of the Longhai Railway, the Ping (Pingdingshan) Nan (Nanyang) section of the Jiao (Jiaozuo) Leng (Lengshuitan, Hubei) Railway, and the Luo (Luoyang) Yi (Yiyang) branch line have also been successively started. Now, 200,000 laborers throughout the province are fighting hard to complete the road construction tasks ahead of schedule.

On these lines, traffic is bustling everywhere. All railway construction headquarters, canteens, medical clinics, radio stations, and spare-time schools serving the construction site have been moved to the site. During rest periods, the construction site is very active, with some taking technical classes, some beating gongs and drums, some singing loudly, and others writing clappers, challenge letters, and big-character posters. Intense work and a happy life have inspired people's booming enthusiasm. By the end of 1958, twenty large and medium-sized bridges and 417 small bridges and culverts had been built, and more than 210 kilometers of track had been laid on the Zhengli double-track line, which is more than 320 kilometers long.

The people of Henan Province have great enthusiasm for building roads. They not only work hard but also carry out technical revolutions to continuously improve labor efficiency. In Xinyang alone, the road construction army modified more than 145,000 tools, with 17 work areas achieving semi-mechanization and 19 work areas achieving vehicle-ization and ball-bearing-ization. After the Nanyang City road construction army achieved vehicle-ization, although the manpower was reduced by more than 2,000 people, the labor efficiency was more than doubled.

The method of phased and campaign-based work is commonly used in various road construction sites. According to the project's situation and the laborers' specialties, specialized teams such as roadbed, bridge and culvert, track laying, and mountain blasting are organized separately. These professional teams all establish work systems with fixed tasks, fixed personnel, fixed time, fixed tools, and fixed quality. All construction sites attach great importance to the quality of the project. For example, on the Pingnan section, all construction sites mobilized the masses to conduct inspections and evaluations, and promptly promoted advanced experience, so that the quality fully meets the standards.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, February 12th. Three months ago, when people took the train on the Jinpu Line through Shandong, the train still ran on a single track; now, they can see oncoming trains speeding on the double track. This is the result of several months of hard work by 200,000 laborers in Shandong Province.

The double-track project of the Jinpu Railway section within Shandong Province is carried out in two phases. The first phase of the project started in August last year, with 130,000 laborers building the three most heavily trafficked sections of the double track from Huangheya to Yancheng, Northeast Fort to Wucun, and Xuecheng to Mengjiagou, with a total length of more than 170 kilometers. The second phase of the project started comprehensively in early November last year, with 200,000 people working during the most intense construction period. As of now, the earth and stone work for the 387 kilometers of double track within Shandong Province has been basically completed, 419 medium and small bridges and culverts have been built, and 297 kilometers of track have been laid, of which 136 kilometers have been opened to traffic in sections, thus greatly improving transportation capacity.

When the news of the construction of the Jinpu double track reached the rural areas along the line in Shandong Province, the broad masses of farmers were overjoyed, and everyone rushed to sign up, quickly organizing a road-building army of more than 100,000 people. During the days of intense construction, red flags fluttered on every double-track construction site during the day, and lights illuminated the area at night, with the sounds of pile driving rising and falling. The laborers put forward the slogan: Go out early, come back late, push the cart and load the soil like shooting stars, complete the double-track restoration by storm, make one day equal to twenty years! After celebrating the Spring Festival, the laborers continued to devote themselves to the road construction battle, and they want to strive to lay the tracks for most of the double track within the province in the first quarter.

    陕西河南山东几十万人奋战铁路工地
    陇海路复线工程加速推进
    津浦路部分复线分段通车
    新华社西安12日电　陕西省党委挂帅，成千上万的铁路职工和民工奋力修筑陇海铁路复线。现在，潼关至临潼段，正在紧张施工；西安至宝鸡一段，一百六十九万多方路基土石方工程和四十五座桥涵已经完成。
    在施工过程中，铁路职工和民工们，开展了技术革新运动，克服了天气严寒和其他困难，保证了工程顺利进行。修建郭村隧道的铁路职工们在打混凝土时，先把沙石烘热，再用五十度的热水混合，战胜了严寒，并且创造了八小时掘进六点三公尺的新纪录。战斗在湭河大桥上的铁路工人，用各种办法解决了基坑塌方的问题，仅用八小时就灌完一百六十五方混凝土，比原计划提前十六小时。渭南、临潼等县和咸阳市的广大民工，创造了自动打夯机、土火车、独轮运土车等先进工具，对减轻民工的体力劳动和提高工作效率，都起了很大作用。
    新华社郑州12日电　河南省全党全民修铁路的高潮，正在蓬蓬勃勃地展开。自京广铁路郑（郑州）李（李家寨）复线在去年8月动工兴修以后，陇海铁路的庙（庙沟）西（西峪口）复线，焦（焦作）冷（湖北冷水滩）铁路的平（平顶山）南（南阳）段，以及洛（洛阳）宜（宜阳）支线，也相继动工兴建。现在全省二十万劳动大军为了提前完成修路任务，正在紧张地奋战。
    在这些线路上，到处车水马龙。所有修路工程指挥部，为工地服务的食堂、医疗所、广播站和业余学校等，都搬上了工地。在休息的时候，工地非常活跃，有的上技术课，有的敲锣打鼓，有的引亢高歌，还有的编快板，写挑战书、大字报。紧张的劳动，愉快的生活，鼓舞了人们蓬蓬勃勃的干劲。到1958年年底，已经建设了大中桥梁二十座，小桥涵四百一十七座，全长三百二十多公里的郑李复线铺了二百一十多公里铁轨。
    河南省人民修路的热情很高，他们不仅苦干，而且展开技术革命，不断提高劳动效率。仅信阳一地修路大军改制的工具就有十四万五千多件，有十七个工区实现了半机械化，十九个工区实现了车子化和滚珠轴承化。南阳市修路大军在实现车子化后，虽然人力减少了二千多人，但劳动效率却提高一倍以上。
    各修路工地普遍采用了分阶段分战役的工作方法，根据工程的情况和民工的特长，分别组织了路基、桥涵、铺轨和开山放炮等专业队。这些专业队都建立定任务、定人员、定时间、定工具、定质量的工作制度。各工地对于工程的质量很重视。如平南段各工地发动群众进行检查评比，及时推广先进经验，使质量完全合乎标准。
    新华社济南12日电　三个月以前，当人们乘津浦线上的火车过山东时，列车还是在单线上行驶；现在却能看到对开的列车在复线上奔驰了。这是山东省二十万民工几个月奋战的结果。
    津浦铁路山东境内一段的复线工程，是分两期进行的。第一期工程从去年8月开始，十三万民工修建了黄河涯至晏城、东北堡至吴村、薛城至孟家沟等运输最繁忙的三段复线，总长度达一百七十多公里；第二期工程在去年11月初全面动工，施工最紧张的时候有二十万人在劳动。截至目前为止，山东省境内三百八十七公里复线的土石方工程，已经基本完成，修建了中、小桥梁、涵洞四百一十九座，铺轨二百九十七公里，其中有一百三十六公里已经分段通车，运输能力因此大有提高。
    当修建津浦复线的消息传到山东省沿线的农村时，广大农民群众兴高采烈，人人争先报名，很快就组织起十多万人的筑路大军。在紧张施工的日子里，各个复线工地上白天红旗招展，夜晚一片灯光，打硪的号子声此起彼伏。民工们提出口号：早出征，晚收兵，推车装土似流星，突击完成修复线，要一天等于二十年！民工们在欢度春节后又继续投入了修路战斗，他们要争取在第一季度内把境内的绝大部分复线铺好轨道。
