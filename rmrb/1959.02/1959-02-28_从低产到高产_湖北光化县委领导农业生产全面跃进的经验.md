From Low Yield to High Yield
The Experience of the Guanghua County Party Committee in Hubei Province in Leading the Comprehensive Leap Forward in Agricultural Production
By Our Correspondents Fang Di and Xu Shijie

    Guanghua County, located in the northern part of Hubei Province, has experienced dramatic increases in industrial and agricultural production, as well as various other economic sectors, over the past year. Currently, a new, larger, and more comprehensive production upsurge is underway. In Hubei Province, this county has become a red flag for the comprehensive leap forward in rural production.

    Changing the Face of Poverty in One Year

    Before 1958, Guanghua County was a well-known impoverished county. Of the county's more than 700,000 mu of cultivated land, poor land predominated over good land, and dry land predominated over paddy fields. According to statistics, barren hilly land accounted for about three-quarters of the total cultivated land area. In 1957, the county's agricultural output reached its highest level in history, with the average yield of several major crops increasing by 50% to 100% compared to normal years. However, even in that year, the average yield of several major crops in the county only reached 320 jin for grain, 35 jin for cotton (lint), and 72 jin for sesame, which was still far behind the vast majority of areas in the province.

    After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the backwardness in production has been greatly changed. Last year, the county's industrial and agricultural output increased many times over, with some industrial and agricultural products increasing by two to three times or more. Diversified economic activities also developed rapidly. The total income of the county's rural population, calculated per capita, has reached more than 200 yuan, an increase of eight to nine times compared to before liberation. Generally speaking, the county's rural production and income levels are now close to those of advanced counties in the province with better natural conditions.

    Both Hard Work and Ingenuity are Necessary

    This year's leap forward in Guanghua County is not an ordinary one, but a particularly large and comprehensive one.

    How did this leap forward come about? Upon analysis, there are certainly many reasons; but the most important is that, under the impetus and inspiration of the Party's general line for socialist construction, people from top to bottom have been motivated to strive for advancement. How to do it? Their experience is: both hard work and ingenuity are necessary, and efforts should be focused on the key points.

    Starting in the winter before last, a high tide of large-scale water conservancy construction, soil improvement, and reform of cultivation techniques was launched throughout the county, regarding these as the main links in striving for a great leap forward in agriculture. At that time, the vast numbers of cadres and masses were enthusiastic and energetic. The County Party Committee proposed to double grain production in 1958 on the basis of grasping the above-mentioned key links. However, cadres and masses expressed their desire to double grain, cotton, and oil production.

    As a result, the already existing contradiction of insufficient labor became even more prominent. Therefore, the County Party Committee timely put forward the slogan of "both hard work and ingenuity," instructing all localities to use various methods to improve labor efficiency, especially to vigorously promote tool reform.

    Guanghua County has always grasped tool reform tightly and achieved remarkable results. Up to now, the county has created, reformed, and popularized hundreds of thousands of various tools. From water conservancy construction to field cultivation, fertilizer accumulation and production, and agricultural product processing, new tools are constantly emerging. The county has achieved vehicle transport, water turbine irrigation and drainage, ball bearing transport tools, and rope-drawn plowing machines. In order to promote the development of tool reform, a mechanical manufacturing and repair network has also been established in the county's rural areas from scratch. Therefore, last year, the county's labor efficiency increased by more than two times. Since the beginning of winter, although a large number of laborers have been transferred to participate in the Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Hub Project and the construction of the Han (Kou) Dan (Jiangkou) Railway, winter production has still been completed very well, much stronger than in the same period last year. The improvement of labor organization certainly has a great relationship with this; but more importantly, tool reform has exerted a great power.

    Vigorously Launch Mass Movements

    To work hard, to work ingeniously, who should we rely on? Guanghua County's experience is: rely on the masses, vigorously launch mass movements.

    When the county was engaged in large-scale water conservancy in the winter before last, a prominent problem encountered was insufficient technical personnel. At that time, the county only had nine general water conservancy technical cadres. What to do? The County Party Committee summarized some areas' experience in launching mass technical learning movements, using on-site internships, experience exchange, organized visits, short-term training, and other methods to cultivate technical personnel. A movement of "everyone learns technology, outsiders become experts" was launched throughout the county, which quickly cultivated thousands of technical personnel.

    The main approach of Guanghua County in launching mass movements in rural production is to carry out socialist competitions to learn from and catch up with the advanced, with different content according to different periods and different central links. In this way, the mass movement unfolds wave after wave with the production season, lasting continuously and rising higher day by day. For example, last year, Zhangji Commune had the largest increase in production. When the County Party Committee proposed the task of realizing "a thousand-jin wheat county" and "earning a year's worth in one season" and "doubling the whole year's output" this year, it called on all communes to "learn from Zhangji, catch up with Zhangji." After a period of time, Xueji Commune caught up with and surpassed Zhangji in terms of summer crop field management centered on accumulating fertilizer, producing fertilizer, and topdressing. Other production tasks were also done excellently. After evaluation and inspection, all communes launched a competition to "learn from Xueji, catch up with Xueji" under the call of the County Party Committee, which powerfully promoted the development of mass production movements.

    The Key to Strengthening Leadership

    Guanghua County's experience proves that to organize rural production, especially when engaging in large-scale mass movements, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party Committee. From their experience, strengthening the leadership of the Party Committee must grasp the following key points:

    1.  Seriously studying and implementing the central policies and guidelines and the relevant instructions of the higher-level Party Committee is an important guarantee for completing tasks. In this regard, the Guanghua County Party Committee has had lessons. For example, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee asked all localities to pay attention to grasping the work of changing dry land to paddy fields, which is an important method of increasing production, several years ago. However, at that time, the Guanghua County Party Committee did not seriously study this instruction, thinking that "Guanghua's water source is too poor, and there is no water conservancy to build," and did not carry out the change of dry land to paddy fields. Later, the Xiangyang Prefectural Party Committee repeatedly emphasized the need to vigorously promote the change of dry land to paddy fields, and the County Party Committee conducted experiments in 1956, which proved that this method was feasible in Guanghua. It is precisely because of this lesson that the Guanghua County Party Committee has been particularly serious about studying and implementing the instructions of the Central Government and the higher-level Party Committee in the past year or so. The reason why rural production in the county has been done so well since last winter is that one of the important reasons is that the county earlier implemented the instructions on rectifying and consolidating communes, and strived for the initiative. 2. Leading cadres should cultivate experimental fields well, often go deep into reality, and connect with the masses. This is even more important when a new job begins. In the past year or so, many major creations have emerged in rural production in Guanghua County, such as the method of building "watermelon seedling-style self-flowing irrigation networks" with the characteristics of being numerous, fast, good, and economical in large-scale water conservancy construction, and vehicle transport and water turbine irrigation in tool reform. All of these were discovered and improved by leaders after going deep into reality and summarizing the creations of the masses. 3. Constantly look forward, prepare early, and arrange early. In their words, this is called "one link fits into another." For example, when the sowing of summer crops has not yet ended, they have already begun to arrange field management; when spring plowing production has not yet arrived, they have begun to vigorously grasp the repair, distribution, and addition of spring plowing farm tools. Always fight prepared battles. 4. Make comprehensive arrangements for work, highlighting the center while taking into account other aspects. The specific approach is: leading cadres divide labor and contract tasks, and the masses establish specialized teams, so that while highlighting the center, everything is managed by someone, creating conditions for achieving a comprehensive leap forward. 5. Constantly learn from the leadership experience of advanced regions. Since last year, Guanghua has successively learned from the experience of Macheng, Gucheng, Hong'an, and other counties in leading rural production, which has been very helpful in improving leadership work.

    Under the leadership of the County Party Committee, the people of Guanghua are further strengthening the management of summer field crops, ensuring that they fight the first battle of this year well, and achieve a year's worth in one season.

    从低产到高产
    湖北光化县委领导农业生产全面跃进的经验
    本报记者　方堤　徐士杰
    湖北省北部地区的光化县，在过去的一年内工农业和其他多种经济都激剧地增产；目前，又掀起了新的、更大和更全面的生产高潮。在湖北省，这个县已经成为农村生产全面大跃进的一面红旗。
    一年改变穷面貌
    1958年以前，光化县还是一个有名的穷县。全县耕地七十多万亩，坏地多、好地少，旱地多、水田少。据统计，土质瘦薄的丘岗地约占总耕地面积的四分之三。1957年，全县的农业产量是历史上最高的一年，几种主要作物的平均单产量分别比常年提高了50％到一倍左右。但就是这一年，全县的几种主要作物的平均单产，也只分别达到粮食三百二十斤、棉花（皮棉）三十五斤、芝麻七十二斤，与省内绝大多数地区比起来仍然相差很远。
    经过1958年大跃进，生产落后面貌已经大大地改观了。在去年全县无论是工业、农业都成倍地增了产，有的工、农业产品增加了两倍到三倍以上，多种经济也发展得很快。全县农村人口的总收入，按人平均计算已经达到二百元以上，较解放前增加了八、九倍。一般地说，这个县的农村生产和收入水平，都已经接近于省内自然条件比它好的先进县了。
    既要苦干又要巧干
    光化县这一年不是一般的跃进，而是特大的、全面的跃进。
    这个跃进是怎样来的？分析起来，原因当然很多；但其中最重要的，是人们在党的社会主义建设总路线的推动和启示下，从上到下地鼓足了力争上游的干劲。如何干呢？他们的经验是：既要苦干，又要巧干，而且要把干劲用在主要关键上。
    从前年冬天起，先后在全县范围内掀起了大兴水利、改良土壤和改革耕作技术的高潮，把这作为争取农业大跃进的几个主要环节。当时，广大干部和群众热情高涨，干劲足。县委提出要在抓好上述几个环节的基础上，使1958年的粮食产量翻一番。可是干部和群众纷纷表示要使粮、棉、油都翻一番。
    这样一来，本来存在着的劳动力不足的矛盾，就显得更加突出了。于是，县委适时地提出了
  “既要苦干，又要巧干”的口号，指示各地必须用各种办法来提高劳动效率，特别是大搞工具改革。
    光化县在改革工具方面一直抓得很紧，成绩卓著。到现在全县创制、改革和推广各种工具达几十万件。从兴修水利到田间耕作、积肥造肥和农产品加工，都不断有新工具出现。全县实现了运输车子化、排灌水车化、运输工具滚珠轴承化和翻地绳索牵引机化。为了推动工具改革的发展，还从无到有地在全县农村中建起了机械制造修配网。因此，去年全县劳动效率提高了两倍以上。入冬以来到现在，全县虽然抽调了大批劳动力参加丹江口水利枢纽工程和汉（口）丹（江口）铁路的建设，但冬季生产仍完成得很好，比上年同期要强得多。其所以如此，改善劳动组织当然有很大关系；但更主要的，是工具改革发挥了巨大的威力。
    大搞群众运动
    要苦干，要巧干，依靠谁？光化县的经验是：依靠群众，大搞群众运动。
    这个县在前年冬天大兴水利时，碰到的一个突出问题是技术力量不足。当时全县只有九个一般的水利技术干部。怎么办呢？县委总结了一些地区大搞群众性的技术学习运动，用现场实习、交流经验、组织参观、短期训练等方式来培养技术力量，在全县开展了“人人学技术、外行变内行”的运动，即迅速地培养出数以千计的技术力量。
    光化县在农村生产中大搞群众运动的主要作法，是根据不同时期和不同中心环节，开展不同内容的学先进、赶先进社会主义竞赛。这样，群众运动就随着生产季节一浪赶一浪地展开，经久不断，日日高涨。例如，去年张集公社增产幅度最大，县委在提出今年要实现“小麦千斤县”和“一季捞全年”、“全年翻一番”的任务时，就号召各公社“学张集、赶张集”。经过一个时期以后，薛集公社在以积肥、造肥、追肥为中心的夏收作物田间管理方面赶上并超过了张集，其他各项生产也搞得很出色。经过评比检查后，各公社又在县委的号召下开展了“学薛集、赶薛集”的竞赛，有力地促进了群众性的生产运动的发展。
    加强领导的关键
    光化县的经验证明，组织农村生产，特别是在大搞群众运动的时候，必须加强党委的领导。从他们的经验来看，加强党委的领导必须抓住如下几个关键：
    一、认真地研究和贯彻中央的政策方针和上级党委的有关指示，是完成任务的重要保证。在这方面，光化县委是有过教训的。像旱地改水田这个增产的重要办法，几年前湖北省委就要各地注意抓这个工作。但当时光化县委由于没有认真研究这个指示，认为“光化水源太差，无水利可修”，没有进行旱地改水田。以后，襄阳地委又一再强调要大搞旱地改水田，县委才在1956年进行了试验，结果证明了这个办法在光化是可行的。正是由于有这个教训，所以光化县委在这一年多来对研究、贯彻中央和上级党委的指示特别认真。去冬以来全县农村生产搞得很好，重要的原因之一就在于这个县更早地贯彻了关于整顿、巩固公社的指示，争取了主动。二、领导干部要种好试验田，经常深入实际，联系群众。在一件新的工作开始时，这点更为重要。一年多来光化县农村生产中出现了许多重大的创造，如在大兴水利上提出了修筑具有多快好省等特点的“西瓜秧式自流灌溉网”的方法，在工具改革上提出了运输车子化、排灌水车化等。所有这些，都是领导深入实际以后发现了群众的创造，加以总结、提高而成的。三、不断地向前看，早准备、早安排，用他们的话来说，这叫“一环套一环”。例如，当夏收作物的播种工作还未结束的时候，他们就已开始安排田间管理；当春耕生产还未到来，他们就着手大抓春耕农具的修配、添制等工作。总是打有准备的仗。四、对工作进行全面安排，既要突出中心，又要兼顾其他。具体作法是：领导分工包干，群众建立专业队伍，作到在突出中心的同时，样样工作有人管，为实现全面跃进创造条件。五、不断地学习先进地区的领导经验。去年以来，光化曾先后学习了麻城、谷城、红安等县的领导农村生产的经验，对改进领导工作很有帮助。
    光化人民在县委的领导下，正在进一步加强夏田作物管理，保证打好今年第一仗，做到一季顶一年。
