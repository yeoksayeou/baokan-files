Newspaper and Literary Criticism Abstract

Discussion on "Song of Youth"

    Yang Mo's novel "Song of Youth" is one of the best-selling literary works recently and has aroused widespread interest among young people. There are also some different evaluations of this work. Discussions are underway in publications. Recently, Comrade Mao Dun published an article in "China Youth" (Issue 4, 1959), affirming that "Song of Youth" is an excellent work with certain educational significance, and there are no errors of principle in its ideological content, but there are areas for improvement in artistic expression. He pointed out that the criticism that negates this work is subjective and one-sided.

    The author said, why affirm that this is an excellent work with a certain educational significance? "Song of Youth" reflects the student movement led by the Party during the historical period from "September 18th" to "December 9th." The ideological content of the work is basically in line with Chairman Mao's judgment on this historical period. It can help readers enrich their understanding of revolutionary history. Through the images of several Communist Party members, it tells readers how the Party's outstanding sons and daughters were once loyal, struggled arduously, and dedicated their lives to the revolutionary cause. It also points out, through the specific facts of the character Lin Daojing, that petty-bourgeois intellectuals must undergo ideological transformation in order to truly serve the people.

    The historical facts reflected in the novel are more than twenty years away from today. If readers do not make an effort to familiarize themselves with this historical situation, but use today's standards to measure things twenty years ago, they will fall into the error of anti-historicism.

    How should the character Lin Daojing be evaluated? The author said that this character image is real and typical. Regarding this character, there are things we can learn from, and there are things we can use as a warning and arouse vigilance. The former is her spirit of pursuing truth, resolutely carrying out self-transformation, and being strong and unyielding under the enemy's coercion before joining the Party; the latter is her constantly revealed fantasies and tenderness. The novel's criticism of Lin Daojing's petty-bourgeois ideology is not forceful enough in some places, but only in some places, not all of them. This is related to the author's ideological level and artistic expression ability. It cannot be judged that the author is protecting these criticized things, or even that the author herself has these criticized things. To determine whether the author is "standing on the petty-bourgeois standpoint and using her own works as a self-expression of the petty bourgeoisie," it is necessary to look at the problem comprehensively from the perspective of historical materialism, and to look at the main tendency and main effect of the work. Comrade Mao Dun believes that, on the whole, saying that the novel's disadvantages outweigh its advantages, or accusing the author of having bad motives, is not based on facts.

    Does the novel have any shortcomings? The author believes that its main shortcomings are: in terms of character description, except for Lin Daojing, the main character, who is written in relatively detail, the other characters in the book mostly exist as "props." Regarding structure, the author's technique is a bit messy. In terms of literary language, the author can express different atmospheres in different occasions, but the vocabulary is not rich enough, and the syntax lacks variation. This makes some tense scenes lack the due enthusiasm and vividness, and some lyrical occasions lack a soft tone.

### 关于“青春之歌”的讨论

专栏：报刊文艺评论摘要

    关于“青春之歌”的讨论
    杨沫同志的长篇小说“青春之歌”，是最近以来销数最大的文学作品之一，在青年中引起了广泛的兴趣。对这部作品也有一些不同的评价。刊物上正在展开讨论。最近茅盾同志在
  “中国青年”（1959年第四期）上发表了文章，肯定“青春之歌”是有一定教育意义的优秀作品，思想内容上没有原则性的错误，艺术表现方面还有需要提高之处。他指出那种否定这部作品的批评是主观的、片面的。
    作者说，为什么肯定这是一部有一定教育意义的优秀作品呢？“青春之歌”所反映的是“九一八”到“一二九”这一历史时期党所领导的学生运动。作品的思想内容基本上是符合于毛主席对这一历史时期的论断的。它可以帮助读者丰富自己的对革命历史的认识。它通过几个共产党员的形象，告诉读者，党的优秀儿女曾经怎样地忠心耿耿、艰苦斗争，为革命事业献出了自己的生命。还通过林道静这个人物的具体事实，指出了小资产阶级知识分子必须经过思想改造才能真正为人民服务。
    小说所反映的历史事实，离开今天二十多年了。读者如果不去努力熟悉这一段历史情况，而用今天条件下的标准去衡量二十年前的事物，这就会陷于反历史主义的错误。
    应该怎样评价林道静这个人物？作者说，这个人物形象是真实的，有典型性的。对于这个人物，有可以供我们学习的，也有可供我们鉴戒、引起警惕的地方。前者，是她在入党以前追求真理、坚决地进行自我改造、在敌人淫威之下坚强不屈的精神；后者是她的时时流露的幻想和温情。小说对于林道静的小资产阶级思想意识在有些地方批判得不够有力，但只是有些地方而已，并不是全部。这和作者的思想水平、艺术表现能力有关。并不能就此判定作者是保护这些被批判的东西，或者甚至说作者本人就有这些被批判的东西。要判定作者是否是“站在小资产阶级立场上，把自己的作品当作小资产阶级的自我表现来进行创作”，就要以历史唯物主义观点全面看问题，要看作品的主要倾向和主要效果。茅盾同志认为，从整个看来，说小说的坏处多于好处，或者指责作者动机不好的论调，都是没有事实根据的。
    小说有没有缺点？作者认为它的主要缺点是：在人物描写方面，除林道静这个主要人物写得比较细致而外，书中的其他人物大都作为“道具”而存在。关于结构，作者的手法有点凌乱。在文学语言方面，作者能够表现不同场合中的不同气氛，然而词汇不够多，句法也缺少变化。这就使得某些紧张的场面缺乏应有的热烈和鲜艳，某些抒情的场合调子不够柔和。
