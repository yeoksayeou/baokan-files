Many Heroes in the Steel City of the Frontier
By our reporters Lin Tian and Lü Nanxin

　　In the early spring morning, the sky is about to dawn but not yet bright, and the Daqingshan Mountains are hidden in the light ink-like mist. The morning wind in the frontier is still quite cold. At this time, from the Kundulun District and Zhangjiayingzi to the Baotou Steel factory area, a tide of people appears. Some of these people come from nearby areas, but more come from all over the country. They come to build the country's new steel base with lofty ideals and vigorous passion.

　　The Forever Young Old Gao

　　In the spring of 1955, when the first batch of construction workers came to the banks of the Kundulun River, there were only a few small villages, some scattered fields, and rolling sand dunes and grasslands within dozens of miles. People settled in simple sheds. When they woke up in the middle of the night, their quilts were covered with a layer of dirt as thick as copper coins. During the day, while eating, a strong wind would blow, scattering yellow sand into their bowls. But no hardship could shake the people's determination to build Baotou Steel.

　　At that time, an old worker encouraged everyone, saying, "We, the working class, must be pioneers, enduring hardships first and enjoying happiness later. Only in this way can we build a strong country with a 'copper body and iron bottom'!"

　　Who was this old worker? He was Gao Decheng, an old plasterer and foreman. This old man joined the Party at the age of sixty, learned to read at the age of sixty-two, and is now sixty-four years old. Every morning, he still leaves home under the stars, walks ten miles to work on the construction site, and returns home after dark. People here affectionately call him "Old Gao."

　　When he came to Baotou, he was already sixty-one years old. The leaders advised him, "Baotou is cold and windy. You should stay in Beijing!" "I'm not afraid of suffering. I can't miss out on the glory of building Baotou Steel!" With such ambition, Old Gao came to Baotou Steel.

　　Since then, regardless of cloudy or rainy days, windy or snowy weather, he has always been running around on the construction site. Last summer, after Old Gao finished repairing houses in the Baotou Steel factory area, he went to build the Baiyun Ebo iron mine.

　　In winter, braving wind and snow, he went out two or three times a night to check the newly plastered buildings. Once, late at night, he put on a sheepskin coat and went out. Before he had gone far, a blizzard was blowing so hard that he couldn't see anyone in front of him. He lost his way and suddenly fell into a snow pit, the snow reaching the base of his thighs. Old Gao struggled hard to get out, found the building, went into each room to see if the stove was burning well and to feel if the wall was frozen, repeatedly instructing the stove watchers to be careful of fire, and then returned to his residence.

　　This old man has been working diligently for the construction of Baotou Steel for three years. But what is even more touching is the old man's heart, full of youthful vitality and burning with creative enthusiasm. Often, after the old grandfather clock in his house struck twelve, Old Gao was still sitting on a small stool, with all kinds of tools such as drills, saws, and pliers spread all over the room. On his wrinkled face, he wore reading glasses, concentrating on drilling, grinding, and carving... Last year, in order to create the automatic sand sifter that he had been researching for three years, he stayed up countless nights, and he didn't know how many times he cut his fingers! His wife couldn't persuade him to sleep, so she got up to help him burn the soldering iron to weld the iron sheet and carve the model. Over the years, Old Gao has created more than a dozen new plastering tools and small machines.

　　What force makes Old Gao so wholeheartedly engaged in the country's construction? Last year, when the organization mobilized him to retire, he said, "I am grateful to the Party for its care, but I still have two things on my mind. One is that the Party saved me from the fire pit and has been leading me to paradise step by step. I have not finished repaying the Party's kindness. Even if I live to be a hundred years old, as long as my body is still strong, I will work. The second is that I want to teach more apprentices for the construction of Baotou Steel." His words expressed the old worker's sincere love for the Party and for the cause of Baotou Steel, who had suffered in the old society and had more than thirty years of work experience. From 1952 to now, Old Gao has been named a labor model and advanced worker every year. He has personally trained more than fifty apprentices and taught plastering techniques to thousands of people. The apprentices respect him as they would their own grandfather and father.

　　A New Generation

　　On the boiling Baotou Steel construction site, the youth of our old generation of workers is renewed; and our young generation of workers is growing so fast and maturing so early. At the age of twenty, they became masters, leading a large group of apprentices to work. They love the arduous pioneering work, and they always want to create something new in every job they do.

　　When Yu Changyu, the young fitter team leader, came to Baotou Steel from Anshan, he had a wish: how happy it would be to participate in the installation of the machines of such a large steel enterprise as Baotou Steel from beginning to end! Last summer, not long after they arrived at Baotou Steel, the first tower crane with a lifting capacity of 40 tons was transported to the blast furnace construction site. Although Yu Changyu had participated in the installation of six blast furnaces in Anshan and Benxi, it was the first time he had installed this type of machine. In those days, he worked during the day and studied the installation drawings late into the night. He remembered almost every one of the crane's three thousand parts in his mind. It was really painstaking! After the crane was installed ahead of schedule, Yu Changyu proposed a new problem for himself: how to make the crane not have to move back and forth, but can lift things behind it? This requires changing the crane's maximum rotation limit from 270 degrees to 360 degrees. Even the engineers had thought that this was impossible. However, Yu Changyu, who had only gone to primary school, made a design after careful observation and several nights of hard thinking with the support of the Party organization. He only lengthened a steel rope by a section and wrapped it around a shaft one more time, which made the crane able to rotate to 450 degrees, becoming a national innovation.

　　This daring and capable young communist party member has, from the very beginning, devoted all his creative enthusiasm and energy to the construction of Baotou Steel. When installing the hot blast stove, he led the team to work as riveters because there were not enough riveters. When welders were in short supply, he went to work as a welder again. At the age of twenty-three, he has mastered ten skills such as lathe, fitter, riveter, electrician, and welder. But what he is best at is installing electrical precipitators. This is a new technological equipment on automated blast furnaces. The first few electrical precipitators in China, set up in Anshan Steel and Benxi Steel, were installed by Yu Changyu's team under the guidance of an engineer who had studied in the Soviet Union. The electrical precipitator for Baotou Steel's No. 1 blast furnace is about to be installed, and Yu Changyu is busy until late at night every day. He is familiar with the drawings on the one hand and teaches his apprentices on the other.

　　The first time we went to his house, he was giving his apprentices a lecture on the electrical precipitator installation regulations. He stood under the lamp in front of a small blackboard, with a tall, thin figure, and a pair of wise eyes under a prominent forehead. He opened a drawing, glanced at it, and drew and spoke on the small blackboard. From the structure and principle of the equipment, to the installation method of each part, he explained each difficult technical term clearly, and he remembered every detail so accurately. From eight o'clock to ten o'clock, the first lesson ended. His little daughter had already been patted to sleep by her mother, and six or seven young men were still listening and taking notes attentively. Even we, who were complete laymen, listened with fascination. How much like a learned professor is this young worker whose hands are covered in oil all day long!

　　After we became friends, he talked to us about a bold plan to welcome the early iron production of the blast furnace: to create an international record in quality and speed when installing the blast furnace electrical precipitator. The Party branch and the trade union have designated him to prepare for this. These days, he is squeezing his time at night to study more than a hundred construction drawings, and he has already thought of several ways to speed up the construction, preparing to let everyone discuss them. He also plans to write a book on the installation of electrical precipitators that has both practical experience and theory, called "Electrical Precipitator Installation Manual," and the outline of the book has been prepared. We talked about his ideals, and he said, "The biggest ideal of being a fitter is to learn all the machines in the world, so that I can do more for the country." From this young man, we see the soul of a new generation of the Chinese working class.

　　The Heroic Divers

　　People may not imagine that in the 80,000-strong construction army of Baotou Steel, there are also several divers. They rushed from the Yangtze River Bridge construction site and from the coast of the Bohai Sea to the banks of the Yellow River. These are brave, calm, and multi-skilled people. With their hands, they can figure out the structure of rocks, and they can also install, disassemble, and do all kinds of projects underwater. They are important players in the underwater project of Baotou Steel's Yellow River water source.

　　Xing Lianxi and Zhang Fuyou, divers from Dalian, have been fighting on the Yellow River for more than eight months. In June last year, as soon as Xing Lianxi arrived at the river, he put on his diving suit and dived into the rolling turbid waves. The muddy and angry river water gave a show of strength to this burly man who was used to working in calm and transparent bays. This man, wearing 120 pounds of "water armor," was beaten up and down by the high-speed Yellow River water several times, unable to grasp the bottom of the river. Xing Lianxi still tried his best and spent a whole half day crawling on the riverbed from the north bank to the south bank, and then from the south bank to the north bank, touching the terrain structure of the Yellow River bottom. In July and August, two particularly large mountain floods suddenly rushed into the Yellow River, and the sludge discharge steel pipe of the mud suction boat was washed away and silted in the quicksand at the bottom of the river. Xing Lianxi and Zhang Fuyou dived to salvage it. The water flow was too fast, and when they dived down, their bodies were flattened, and sometimes they were beaten far away. But they persevered and went down again and again, fighting in the river for three days until the last pipe was touched. In winter, the Yellow River was sealed with a layer of ice more than three feet thick, and the dredger was still working. Every time a fault occurred underwater, Xing Lianxi and Zhang Fuyou had to drill into the ice hole to troubleshoot at the bottom of the water. During the Spring Festival, they dived several times. Once, when closing the bottom of the caisson, Xing Lianxi insisted on working under the ice for two hours, which is rare in the experience of divers, but for Baotou Steel to have water early and produce iron and steel early, what difficulties can stop these underwater heroes?

　　The construction of Baotou Steel has attracted many heroic men and women, and these heroes have attracted many writers and poets. A poet with gray hair among his black hair said that he often considered writing a "New Gathering of Heroes" to sing the praises of these heroes. Indeed, our heroes today are not only comparable to the characters at the Gathering of Heroes in the past, but they are even better! (Attached picture)

    塞外钢城英雄多
    本报记者　林田　吕南新
    初春的早晨，天色将明未明，大青山隐藏在淡墨似的雾里，塞外的晨风还相当冷。这时候，从昆都仑区和张家营子通向包钢厂区的路上，便出现了潮水般的人流。这些人，有的来自附近地区，更多的是来自天南地北。他们怀着崇高的理想和旺盛的激情，来建设祖国新的钢铁基地。
    永远年轻的老高头
    1955年春天，第一批建筑工人来到昆都仑河两岸的时候，几十里之内，只有几处小村，一些零零散散的田地，再就是连绵的沙丘和草地。人们在席棚里安下了身，夜里一觉醒来，被子上落了铜钱厚的一层土；白天正吃着饭，刮起了大风，饭碗里撒上了黄沙。但任何艰难困苦，也动摇不了人们建设包钢的决心。
    那时候，一位老工人鼓励大家说：“我们工人阶级就是要打先锋，先‘受屈’，后享福，这样才能建设起‘铜梆铁底’的强国呀！”
    这位老工人是谁呢？他是老抹灰工、工长高德成。这位老人，六十岁入党，六十二岁学文化，今年已经六十四岁，每天早晨还是顶着星星，走十里路到工地上班，天黑以后才回家。这里人们都敬爱地称他“老高头”。
    他来包头那年，已经是六十一岁的人了，领导上劝他：包头天冷，风大，你老人家还是留在北京吧！“吃点苦不怕，建设包钢的光荣俺不能没份儿！”老高头就这样雄心勃勃地到了包钢。
    从那时以来，不管天阴下雨，风里雪里，他总是在工地上跑来跑去。去年夏天，老高头在包钢厂区修完房子以后，又去建设白云鄂博铁矿山。
    冬天，他冒着风雪，一夜出去两三次，检查刚抹灰的楼房。有一次深夜，他披了个羊皮袄走出去没多远，一阵暴风雪刮得对面不见人。他迷了方向，猛一下跌到一个雪坑里，雪没到大腿根。老高头费了好大力气挣扎出来，摸到了楼房跟前，到每间房子里，瞧瞧火炉旺不旺，摸摸墙冻了没冻，再三嘱咐看火炉的人注意防火，然后才回住处。
    这位老人，就这样兢兢业业，三年如一日地为包钢建设辛勤操劳。可是更感动人的，是老人那颗充满青春活力和燃烧着创造热情的心。往往，当他家里的老座钟敲过十二下以后，老高头还坐在小凳子上，钻子、锯子、钳子等各式各样的工具摆满了一屋地。他那皱纹满布的脸上，架着老花镜，聚精会神地钻呀，磨呀，刻呀……。去年，他为了创造那已经钻研了三年的自动筛沙器，熬过了多少个夜晚，手指头也不知割破了多少次！他的老伴催他睡觉催不动，就起来帮他烧烙铁焊铁皮，刻模型。几年来，老高头创造了十几种抹灰新工具和小型机械。
    是什么力量使老高头这样全心全意地从事祖国的建设事业呢？去年，当组织上动员他退休的时候，他说：“我感激党对我的关怀，可是俺还有两桩心事没了。一桩是，党把我从火坑救出来，步步上天堂，党的恩情俺还没有报完，哪怕我活到一百岁，只要身子骨还硬，就要干活。第二桩，俺还要多教些徒弟，为包钢建设。”他的话，说出了这位在旧社会受苦受难，有着三十多年工龄的老工人对党的一片赤诚和对包钢事业的热爱。从1952年到现在，老高头年年被评为劳动模范和先进工作者。他亲手培养了五十多名徒弟，向成千人传授过抹灰技术。徒弟们像对自己的爷爷和父亲那样尊敬他。
    一代新人
    在沸腾的包钢建设工地，我们老一代的工人青春长在；而我们年轻一代工人又成长得这样快，成熟得这样早。他们二十多岁的年纪，就作了师傅，领着一大帮徒弟干活。他们热爱艰巨的开创事业，作每件工作，总要有新的创造。
    青年钳工组长于长玉，从鞍山来包钢的时候，就抱着一个愿望：能够从头到尾参加安装包钢这样一个大钢铁企业的机器，该是多幸福啊！去年夏天，他们到包钢不久，第一台起重能力四十吨的塔式大吊车，运到了高炉工地。于长玉虽然在鞍山、本溪参加安装过六座高炉，可还是第一次安装这种机器。那些天，他白天干活，晚上，半夜半夜地研究安装图纸，吊车的三千多个零件，几乎每件都记在心里，这真是费尽了苦心！吊车提前安好了，于长玉又给自己提出一个新的难题：怎样能使吊车不必前后移动，就可以吊运它背后的东西？这需要把吊车的最大转动限度，从二百七十度改为三百六十度。这问题，连工程师也曾经认为是办不到的。可是只上过小学的于长玉，在党组织支持下，经过仔细观察和几夜苦思后作出了设计，只把一根钢绳加长一段，在一根轴上多绕一圈，就使吊车能转到了四百五十度，成为全国的一项创举。
    这个敢想敢干的年轻的共产党员，就是这样，从一开始，就把他的全部创造热情和精力，倾注在包钢建设上。安装热风炉的时候，铆工不足，他就带领小组去作铆工；焊工紧张的时候，他又去作焊工。二十三岁的年纪，他已经掌握了车、钳、铆、电、焊等十种技能。可是他最擅长的，还是安装电器除尘器。这是自动化高炉上的一项新的技术设备。设在鞍钢和本溪的中国头几台电气除尘器，就是在一位到苏联学习过的工程师的指导下，由于长玉小组安装起来的。包钢第一号高炉的电气除尘器快要安装了，于长玉又天天忙到深夜，他一面熟悉图纸，一面教徒弟。
    我们第一次到他家的时候，他正在给徒弟们讲电气除尘器安装规程。他站在灯下一块小黑板前，细高的身材，突出的前额下一对睿智的眼睛。他打开一张图纸，看了一眼，在小黑板上边画边讲。从设备的构造、原理，直讲到各部分的安装方法，每个难懂的技术名词他都解释得清清楚楚，每个细节他都记得那样准确。从八点一直讲到十点，结束了第一课。他的小女儿已经由妈妈拍着入睡了，六、七个小伙子还在个个全神贯注地边听边记。连我们这些完全外行的人，也听得入了神。这个两手终日粘满油泥的青年工人，多么像一个学识渊博的教授啊！
    在我们成了朋友以后，他向我们谈到了他们迎接高炉早出铁的一个大胆的计划：要在安装高炉电气除尘器的时候，在质量和速度上，创造一个国际水平的纪录。党总支和工会已经指定他在进行准备。这些天，他挤晚上的时间，研究着一百多张施工图纸，已经想到了几项加速施工的办法，准备让大家讨论。他还打算在电气除尘器安装过程中，写一本又有实际经验又有理论的书，书名叫“电器除尘安装手册”，书的提纲已经作好了。我们谈到他的理想，他说：“作个钳工，最大的理想是摸会全世界的机器，好为祖国作更多的事。”从这个年青人的身上，我们看到了我国工人阶级一代新人的灵魂。
    英雄的潜水手
    人们也许想像不到，在包钢八万人的建设大军里，还有几名潜水手。他们从长江大桥工地，从渤海岸上，赶到了黄河边。这是一些勇敢、沉着而又有多种技能的人。他们凭着一双手可以摸出岩石的构造，也可以在水下安装拆卸机械，和作各种工程。他们是包钢黄河水源地水下工程上的重要角色。
    从旅大来的潜水手邢连希和张福有，已经在黄河上战斗了八个多月。去年6月，邢连希一到河边，就穿起了潜水衣，潜到滚滚浊浪里。混黄暴怒的河水，对这个在平静透明的海湾里工作惯了的人，来了个下马威。这个身着一百二十斤“水甲”的彪形大汉，几次被高流速的黄水打得上不着天，下不着地，抓不住河底。邢连希还是想尽了各种办法，整整用了半天时间，在河底上，从北岸爬到南岸，又从南岸爬到北岸，摸了摸黄河底的地形构造。7、8月间，突然有两场特大的山洪奔入黄河，吸泥船的排泥钢管被冲走，淤在河底流沙里。邢连希和张福有潜水去打捞。水流太急，他们潜下去，身子就被打平，有时被打下去好远。但他们还是百折不挠地一次次下去，在河水里奋战了三天，直到把最后一根管子摸到。冬天，黄河上封上了三尺多厚的冰层，挖泥船还在继续工作着，每次水下发生了故障，邢连希和张福有都要钻到冰洞里，到水底去排除故障。春节期间，他们还下了几次水。一次在封闭沉井底的时候，邢连希在冰层下坚持了两个钟头，这是在潜水手们的经历中少有的，可是为了包钢早通水，早出铁出钢。什么困难能挡住这些水下英雄呢？
    包钢的建设吸引了许多英雄男女，而这些英雄又吸引了不少的作家诗人。一位黑发中已见银丝的诗人说，他常常考虑写一个“新群英会”来歌颂这些英雄。的确，我们今天的英雄们不但比得上当年群英会上的人物，而且比他们还要胜过一筹呢！（附图片）
