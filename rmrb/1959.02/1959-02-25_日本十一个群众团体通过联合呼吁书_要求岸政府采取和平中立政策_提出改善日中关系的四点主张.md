Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 24th -- The National Conference for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations and ten other Japanese mass organizations passed a joint appeal at a meeting held today, demanding that the Nobusuke Kishi government adopt a policy of peace, neutrality, and friendship in order to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations.

The appeal stated that they believe that if the Japanese Diet immediately passes a resolution including the following four points and requires the Nobusuke Kishi government to implement this resolution, relations between Japan and China can be improved.

The four points are: adopt a policy of friendship towards China and strive to normalize relations with China; respect China's sovereignty, stop creating "two Chinas" schemes and efforts to bring China into the United Nations; adhere to the principle of peaceful coexistence and not participate in any military alliance; and immediately work to promote economic and cultural exchanges between Japan and China.

The joint appeal issued by the eleven groups has been delivered to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President of the Senate, and all political parties in Japan.
