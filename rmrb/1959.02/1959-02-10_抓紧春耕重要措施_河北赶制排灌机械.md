Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Electric Report: Hebei Province recently convened an irrigation and drainage machinery conference, deciding to produce more and better irrigation and drainage machinery with fixed specifications and models, to support a greater leap forward in agricultural production.

Solving the problem of irrigation and drainage machinery is one of the important measures Hebei Province is taking to prepare for spring ploughing and strive for a greater agricultural harvest this year. Hebei Province expanded its irrigated area by more than 60 million mu last year, and now has more than 54,000 machine wells; however, there is still a great shortage of irrigation and drainage machinery. This year, the land has been deeply ploughed, and the water demand has increased. In particular, the vast majority of wheat in the province this year has been deeply ploughed and densely planted. The seedlings are now dense and strong, and if water and fertilizer cannot keep up, it will affect the bumper harvest. Therefore, while vigorously promoting the manure accumulation movement, it is necessary to start early and prepare irrigation and drainage machinery.

The conference determined that the province should produce 230,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery from January to April, including gas engines, diesel engines, and portable steam engines. It also determined that ten types of powered irrigation and drainage machinery, including the 405-horsepower gas engine manufactured by Tianjin Tractor Factory, the 10-horsepower gas engine manufactured by Yangliuqing Power Machinery Factory, and the 10-horsepower diesel engine manufactured by Tangshan Xugezhuang Iron Factory, as well as an impulse water pump that uses the drop of water as power, would be the standardized products for irrigation and drainage machinery in the province. The conference proposed that after the standardized products are produced, they must undergo strict quality inspection and test runs before leaving the factory to ensure that all products leaving the factory are qualified, sturdy, and durable. New products must be carefully appraised and repeatedly tested before being mass-produced and promoted.

The conference requested that all localities pay close attention to saving raw materials in the production of irrigation and drainage machinery, mobilize the masses to boldly experiment with substitute materials, and use local iron and local steel to replace good iron and good steel. When using substitutes, it is necessary to pay attention to ensuring quality and safety, and prevent causing greater losses and waste. In addition, all communes and brigades in the province must quickly rectify and establish repair and maintenance networks, and first of all, seize the maintenance of existing irrigation and drainage machinery in order to give full play to the role of existing irrigation and drainage equipment.

    抓紧春耕重要措施  河北赶制排灌机械
    新华社天津电　河北省最近召开排灌机械会议，决定定规格定型号生产又多又好的排灌机械，支持农业生产更大的跃进。
    解决排灌机械问题，是河北省准备春耕，争取今年农业更大丰收的重要措施之一。河北省去年扩大了水地面积六千多万亩，现在已有机井五万四千多眼；但是，排灌机械尚差很多。今年土地经过深翻，需水量大了，特别是今年全省小麦绝大部分都是深翻密植，现在苗密苗壮，如果水肥跟不上，将影响大丰收。因此，在当前大搞积肥运动的同时，需要及早动手，作好排灌机械的准备。
    这次会议确定全省1月到4月要生产二十三万马力的排灌机械，其中包括煤气机、柴油机、锅驼机等，并且确定把天津市拖拉机厂制造的四○五马力煤气机，杨柳青动力机械厂制造的十马力煤气机，唐山胥各庄铁工厂制造的十马力柴油机等十种动力排灌机械，和一个以水的落差作为动力的冲击水泵，作为全省排灌机械的定型产品。会议提出：已定型的产品生产出来以后，要经过严格的质量检查和试车再出厂，保证出厂的产品一律合格，而且坚固耐用。新产品制造出来，更需要经过认真的鉴定和反复的试验，然后才成批生产和推广。
    会议要求各地在生产排灌机械中，要切实注意节约原材料，发动群众大胆试验代用材料，利用土铁土钢代替好铁好钢。采用代用品时，必须注意保证质量和安全，防止造成更大的损失浪费。此外，全省各公社、大队要迅速整顿和建立修配网，首先要抓紧原有排灌机械的检修工作，以便充分发挥原有排灌设备的作用。
