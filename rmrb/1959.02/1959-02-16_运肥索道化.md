    Manure Transportation Becomes Cable-Car-ized
    The Quantang Brigade of the Xianxi Commune in Anhua County, Hunan Province, has basically realized the cable-car-ization of manure transportation. On January 20th, the Dafu Office held an on-site meeting in this brigade to promote their experience.
    The brigade has erected a total of fifty aerial cableways. When the representatives visited the site and saw the old mountain soil from the hillsides and cliffs being transported to the fields using the cableways, they all praised it and said they had found good fertilizer and thought of a good method. Representatives from the county party committee inspection team even used a watch to calculate the speed of the cableway transporting fertilizer: two hundred loads in half an hour. They also compared carrying by shoulder with using the cableway: one load by shoulder, twenty loads by cableway.
    The cableway is made of bamboo cable made of Phyllostachys heterocycla. In the beginning, the brigade cadres took the lead and helped the Seventh Production Team set up the first cableway. They adopted a method of simultaneous mobilization, creation, experimentation, summarization, improvement, and promotion, and then immediately convened an on-site meeting. The brigade also organized a special team to split bamboo and make cables to solve the difficulty of lacking equipment. At present, more than fifty aerial cableways have been erected throughout the brigade. They also plan to erect 250 aerial cableways within ten days, so that the entire brigade will comprehensively realize the cable-car-ization of transportation.

    运肥索道化
    湖南安化县仙溪公社泉塘大队，基本上实现了运肥索道化。1月20日，大福办事处在这个队开了现场会，推广他们的经验。
    这个大队共架设了空中索道五十处。当代表们实地参观，看到四处半山腰和岩坎上的老山土，利用索道运到田里时，个个称赞不已，都说找的好肥料，想的好办法。县委检查团的代表，还用手表计算了索道运肥的速度，半小时两百担；他们还用肩挑和索道作了对比，肩挑一担，索道二十担。
    索道是用楠竹制成的竹缆做的。开始时大队干部亲自动手，帮助第七生产队架好了第一条索道。他们采取边发动、边创造、边试验、边总结、边改进、边推广的办法，随即召开了现场会议。大队还组织了破篾制缆专业队，解决缺少器材的困难。目前全队已架起了五十多处的空中索道。他们还计划在十天内架设空中索道二百五十处，使全大队上下运输全面实现索道化。
