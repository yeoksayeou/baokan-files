Starting from the Factory Director "Enlisting"
    Wu Lü

    The Shanghai Fifth Printing and Dyeing Factory's method of having the factory director "enlist" and periodically rotating some workers and cadres in the work sections is a new attempt to implement the Party's mass line and practice "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" in industrial enterprises. This attempt has been very effective and deserves our attention, especially in the face of the new situation of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959. Further implementing the Party's mass line and practicing "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" is indeed a very important issue.

    We often say now that the Great Leap Forward of 1958 was a great achievement of the rectification campaign. Why should the Great Leap Forward of 1958 be linked to the rectification campaign that began in 1957? This is because the rectification campaign that began in 1957 further strengthened the Party's ties with the masses and further promoted the Party's mass line tradition on all fronts of industry and agriculture. The strengthening of the Party's ties with the masses and the promotion of the mass line tradition not only improved the Party's work but also raised the consciousness of the masses and stimulated their enthusiasm. This was the driving force behind the Great Leap Forward of 1958.

    "Two participations, one reform, and three combinations" is an initiative that developed on the basis of the rectification movement in industrial enterprises and uses the mass line method to manage enterprises. The promotion of this experience directly promoted the Great Leap Forward on the industrial front in 1958. Now, the Shanghai Fifth Printing and Dyeing Factory's method of having the factory director "enlist" and periodically rotating some workers and cadres in the work sections has further enriched the experience of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations." It shows that there can be two ways for cadres to participate in labor: one is to regularly participate in labor in conjunction with the central work, and the other is to leave management work and go to the groups to "enlist"; there can also be two ways for workers to participate in management: one is to participate in some daily management work of the production group; the other is to transfer some workers and section cadres for rotation to take on the management work of the section. Although these two methods of cadres participating in labor and workers participating in management are not exactly the same, the effect is the same. Industrial enterprises with the conditions can use these two methods simultaneously to make the content of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" richer, the connection between leaders and the masses closer, and the enterprise's production achieve a greater leap forward.

    The mass line is the fundamental line of our Party. We should constantly strengthen our ties with the masses. Now, in order to realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, a new upsurge of the mass production movement is rising. At this time, it is particularly necessary for comrades who are doing leadership work in industrial enterprises to go deep into reality and deep into the masses to mobilize and organize the masses, to discover and solve those problems that cannot be discovered and solved by just sitting in the office and calculating accounts, to mobilize the enthusiasm of all aspects of the enterprise, and therefore it is particularly necessary to continue to implement "two participations, one reform, and three combinations."

    从厂长“当兵”谈起
    吴滤
    上海第五印染厂厂长“当兵”和工段中部分工人与干部定期轮换的办法，是在工业企业中贯彻党的群众路线，实行“两参一改三结合”的经验的新的尝试。这个尝试，效果很好，很值得我们注意，特别是面临着1959年更大更好更全面跃进的新的形势，进一步贯彻党的群众路线，实行“两参一改三结合”，确实是个很重要的问题。
    我们现在常说，1958年的大跃进是整风运动的伟大成果。为什么1958年的大跃进要同1957年就开始的整风运动联系起来呢？这就是因为从1957年开始的整风运动进一步密切了党同群众的联系，在工业、农业各个战线上进一步发扬了党的群众路线的传统。党同群众的联系的加强，群众路线的传统的发扬，不但改善了党的工作，而且提高了群众的觉悟，激发了群众的积极性。这是1958年大跃进的原动力。
    “两参一改三结合”，就是在工业企业整风运动的基础上发展起来的，用群众路线的办法管理企业的创举。这个经验的推广，直接推动了1958年工业战线上的大跃进。现在，上海第五印染厂厂长“当兵”和工段中部分工人与干部定期轮换的办法，又进一步丰富了“两参一改三结合”的经验。它表明干部参加劳动可以有两种办法：一种是结合中心工作经常参加劳动，一种是脱离管理工作到小组去“当兵”；工人参加管理也可以有两种办法：一种是参加生产小组的部分日常管理工作；一种是抽调部分工人和工段的干部轮换，去担任工段的管理工作。这两种干部参加劳动和工人参加管理的办法，虽然不尽相同，但效果却是相同的。有条件的工业企业可以把这两种办法同时并用，使“两参一改三结合”的内容更加丰富，领导同群众的联系更加密切，企业的生产得到更大的跃进。
    群众路线是我们党的根本路线。我们应当不断加强同群众的联系。现在，为实现1959年更大更好更全面的跃进，一个新的群众生产运动的高潮正在兴起。这个时候，特别需要在工业企业中做领导工作的同志深入实际，深入群众，去发动群众，组织群众，去发现和解决那些只坐在办公室算账所不能发现和解决的问题，去调动企业中各方面的积极性，因而也特别需要继续实行“两参一改三结合”。
