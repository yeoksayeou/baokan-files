Xinhua News Agency, February 4th. According to "Pravda," Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Kirichenko's speech at the 21st Congress of the CPSU on the morning of January 31st, is as follows:

    Comrades! Our congress listened very carefully to Comrade Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev's report. This report summarized the brilliant victories achieved by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people in the struggle to consolidate the political and economic strength of the Soviet state. The report provided a comprehensive Marxist-Leninist analysis of the great and vibrant processes occurring in Soviet society, elucidated the urgent need for further development of our economy, and conducted a profound theoretical exploration of some extremely important issues regarding the transition from socialism to communism.

    The 21st Congress of the Party is a milestone in the powerful ascent of socialist society towards a new and higher stage of development, a milestone in the Soviet people's rapid leap forward along the road to communism.

    In evaluating the results of the great achievements of the Soviet people, it is no exaggeration to say that in the past five years, especially in the years since the 20th Congress, our country has reached a peak, from which a broad vision unfolds, seeing the delightful prospect of the magnificent seven-year plan for the comprehensive construction of communist society. The past five years have been a good start for the Soviet Union to enter a new historical period.

    The Party resolutely sweeps away all decadent things hindering progress
    Crushing the Anti-Party Group is a Significant Victory for the Realization of Leninism

    All the enormous achievements of our country are the result of the Party's great organizational work, the Party's leadership and guidance, and the Party's far-sighted, flexible, and correct Leninist policies. The Party develops and creatively applies Marxist-Leninist theory, while also boldly and revolutionarily resolutely sweeping away all decadent and outdated things hindering our progress. Everyone remembers how fiercely the Central Committee was attacked by the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov, which opposed the Central Committee's major measures to further boost the national economy, further improve the material welfare of the people, and major measures on other issues.

    Following the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Party, the Central Committee made every effort to eradicate all tendencies deviating from Leninism, broadly open up paths for all new and progressive phenomena produced by the creativity of the masses, and establish the entire life of the Party and the state in a completely Leninist manner. But it was precisely at this time that the participants of the anti-Party group attempted to turn us towards the path condemned by the 20th Party Congress.

    Comrades, I should say that after Stalin's death, the participants of the anti-Party group began attacking almost every new thing concerning the leadership of the country, the construction of the armed forces, and foreign policy, based on Leninist doctrine and practical experience, at every meeting of the Central Presidium. However, they particularly opposed and began to fiercely attack the Party's general line after the 20th Congress. The anti-Party group tore off its mask and, on June 18, 1957, organized opposition to the policy formulated by the 20th Congress of the Party. At that time, the participants of this group assessed their strength in the Central Committee Presidium and concluded that they seemed to have the power to change the policies of the Party and the government. Everyone knows how this ended. The further we move away from the days when the anti-Party group attempted to deviate our Party from its general line and attempted to split the ranks of the Party's Leninist unity, the clearer we can see the full baseness of the divisive activities of these political conspirators and double-dealers, and the full harm of the path they wanted to lead our country and our Party onto.

    It must be affirmed that the Central Committee of the CPSU, our Party, crushed the anti-Party group and achieved a major victory in the struggle to implement the Leninist general line and creatively apply Marxism-Leninism to the practice of communist construction. (Applause)

    Everyone knows what these despicable dogmatists did. They were deeply mired in the quagmire of conservatism, deliberately picking at words and phrases, ignoring how far they had deviated from the vibrant and genuine Marxism-Leninism, from the life of the people, and from everything that turns theory into material force. When Vladimir Ilyich Lenin spoke of such people, he said: "...he...understands nothing about political economy, only grabs at quotations, like a scholar with citation cards in his head, and is helpless when encountering a new problem not mentioned in the book, taking out a quotation that should not be taken out at all" (Lenin's Collected Works, Russian edition, Volume 29, page 335, Chinese edition, page 327). (Lively atmosphere in the hall)

    Everyone knows that a true Marxist-Leninist must not only be well-versed in the laws of Marxist philosophy, but also be good at applying these laws to practice, good at correctly applying these laws to life; not only must he have a good grasp of the various categories of Marx's political economy of capitalism, but he must also clearly understand the economic laws of socialism and be good at applying them to benefit the development of socialist society and benefit the people. A true Marxist-Leninist must not only study and understand the past of his own people, but also clearly and deeply understand the lives of the working people today, deeply care about today's life, constantly feel its pulse and be good at looking to the future, and be good at formulating the prospects for social development. Lenin said: "...Marxists must consider the lively practical life, must consider the precise facts of reality..." and he often quoted a famous saying to everyone: "My friend, theory is gray, but the tree of life is ever green" (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian edition, Volume 24, page 26, Chinese edition, Volume 25).

    The Entire Activity of the Party Central Committee in Recent Years
    Is an Example of the Creative Application of Marxism-Leninism

    Today we can point out with great satisfaction that the Party Central Committee has precisely solved various problems of domestic and international policy and various tasks in the process of communist construction from the standpoint of creative Marxism-Leninism, from the interests of the Soviet people, and taking into account practical circumstances and specific conditions. Now even the most stubborn skeptics see how correct and far-sighted our Party Central Committee is, and it has successively implemented major national measures, which are not only of political and economic significance, but also of important theoretical significance.

    Let us take the issue of reforming the management of industry and construction as an example. As long as we evaluate the results of the reform, we must say that the reform has played a real revolutionary role in the development of industry and other sectors of the socialist economy, and has fully achieved the intended goals. Our industry has never had such a boom as it does now. Everyone knows that in the years of several five-year plans, the industry of the Soviet state has achieved vigorous development. However, the work of some industrial sectors was not always balanced. For example, in some years, the coal, metallurgy, iron ore, and some other industrial sectors did not complete their plans. Comrades, everyone can recall how many resolutions were passed on this issue, how many telegrams, instructions, and directives flew like snowflakes to enterprises, and how much effort the central and local authorities made for these issues. Emergency mobilization and shock tactics were carried out one after another, but the progress was slow, and we did not always achieve the expected results.

    What is the situation now? All industrial sectors, including those that were unstable and worked intermittently in the past, are now smoothly completing their tasks. Even the forestry industry, which everyone remembers has been the subject of jokes for many years, completed its annual plan ahead of schedule last year, which made us all happy.

    From this it can be seen that experience shows that the Party's fundamental reform of the past methods of economic leadership is completely correct and timely. This reform has stimulated new and unprecedented strength and created extremely favorable conditions to maximize the vast internal potential and possibilities inherent in the socialist mode of production, so that our national economy can develop by leaps and bounds.

    Comrades! The Party and the Party Central Committee's creative and organizational role is particularly powerfully manifested in the victorious completion of the task of rapidly developing agriculture. Everyone knows what the state of our agricultural production was just a few years ago. At that time, there was not enough grain in the country, and there was a serious shortage of meat, milk, oil, sugar, vegetables, and other necessary foods.

    What were the reasons for this situation in agriculture? It should be known that in the past our agriculture also had an excellent army of collective farmers working, as well as experienced leading cadres, machine operators, and agronomists. Before 1953, our agriculture was also equipped with tractors, combine harvesters, and other machines. There were also ancient wastelands in Kazakhstan and Siberia. The problem was that the enormous potential of the socialist economy was not utilized very well. Those responsible for leading the country's agriculture were far from agriculture and did not understand agricultural production. Wherever they went, they did not interact with people, did not consult with people, did not look at the processes taking place in the countryside, and treated the needs of collective farms and collective farmers with a landlord-like irresponsible attitude.

    The historical significance of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU lies in the fact that this meeting correctly assessed the actual situation of the country's agriculture, formulated a comprehensive program for the rapid development of agricultural production, and concentrated the strength of the Party and the people to solve this task. Now everyone sees how amazing changes have taken place in the countryside. Collective farmers and all the people are very satisfied with these measures and talk about the effective impact of these measures on consolidating the collective farm system. Life in the collective farm countryside has begun to be much better, much richer, and the working conditions are also different. Collective farmers are working with greater enthusiasm and initiative. Our achievements in agriculture are obvious to all, and all the people, every Soviet worker, has seen these achievements.

    Comrades, this is the manifestation in practice of the living transforming force and organizational role of our Party, the impact of our Party's resolutions, which were adopted on the basis of a deep study of practice and the experience of the masses of the people, and on the basis of a theoretical summary of the actual process of our life and construction.

    The entire activity of our Party Central Committee in recent years vividly demonstrates the Leninist wisdom of the Party, its ability to find the central link, and its ability to successfully solve extremely important problems of Party building, state building, and economic construction by grasping this link. Everything that has been completed in the Soviet state since the 20th Congress of the CPSU is an example of our Party's creative application of Marxist-Leninist doctrine in practice, and is a huge contribution to the treasury of Marxism-Leninism, the doctrine of the laws of development of human society that is eternally new and eternally full of vitality. (Applause)

    The achievements of our Party and people are truly enormous. It is appropriate to point out the outstanding work of Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, in raising and elucidating many important theoretical and practical issues of our Party and the Soviet state, his Leninist firmness, principle, and initiative, as well as his enormous organizational work. (Applause)

    Comrades! The 20th Congress of the CPSU opened a new stage in the life and development of our Party, marking the victory of Leninist ideas and Lenin's doctrine on the Party. After the 20th Congress, the entire life and activities of our Party were particularly filled with tremendous creative content and filled with events of truly historical significance.

    The Unity Between the Party and the People
    Is an Indestructible Fortress
    The Party's Organizational Work Among the Masses
    Must Be Raised to a Higher Level

    In implementing the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Central Committee implemented a series of measures to eliminate the influence of the personality cult, restore strict adherence to Leninist norms of Party life and the principle of collective leadership within the Party ranks, and extensively develop one of the fundamental Leninist principles of Party building - intra-Party democracy. These measures have greatly increased the activity and initiative of the Party membership and the combat effectiveness of Party organizations and our entire Party. The sense of responsibility of Party members for the work situation in enterprises, collective farms, and institutions has been strengthened, the life of primary Party organizations has become more active, and the level of their organizational work has been raised. Party organizations at all levels have fundamentally changed their working methods and methods of leading economic construction, resolutely discarding everything that is outdated and does not meet the new requirements and new tasks. They are dealing with production issues more deeply and skillfully.

    The unity between the Party and the people is an indestructible fortress. The illusions and conspiracies of many enemies of socialism have been shattered more than once on this fortress. Our Party has further strengthened its unity with the people, because the Party believes that it is its sacred duty to unswervingly implement Lenin's following teachings, that is, it must maintain close ties with the people, and when leading the masses, it must not only teach the masses, but also learn from the masses. Submitting the most important issues of national significance to public discussion is one of the obvious manifestations of this. Before deciding on major issues, the Central Committee consults with the people and listens to the opinions, suggestions, criticisms, and hopes of the Soviet people. The nation's advanced individuals, heads of Party, Soviet, and economic organs, large enterprises, and collective farms, scientists, engineers, technicians, and other staff members are often invited to attend the Central Plenary Sessions and Party Central meetings on various important issues. The Party did this when it passed resolutions on reforming the management of industry and construction, reforming machine and tractor stations, strengthening the connection between schools and life, and controlling the figures of the seven-year plan currently being discussed at the Party Congress.

    Isn't this a powerful proof of the strengthening of the ties between the Party and the masses, and a convincing proof that, as Lenin pointed out, the Soviet socialist system guarantees the extensive attraction of the people "...to participate regularly, continuously and decisively in the democratic administration of the state."

    The measures implemented by the Party to expand the powers of the union republics and local Party and government organs are of great significance for further promoting Soviet democracy in our country. These measures have had an extremely favorable impact on promoting the economic and cultural upsurge of the union republics and consolidating the Soviet social system. The Party is constantly concerned with strictly observing socialist legality and protecting the rights and interests of Soviet citizens. A series of new laws passed by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to consolidate our country's socialist legal order will be of great significance in this regard. As Comrade N.S. Khrushchev said in his report, there are now no people imprisoned for political reasons in our country. All the people know and feel that our revolutionary legal system has been restored, and people strictly abide by the revolutionary legal system, and those who violate the revolutionary legal system are exposed and severely punished. (Applause)

    Comrades, the Leninist policy of the Communist Party correctly reflects the fundamental interests of the Soviet people, and it is the foundation of our society's existence. The Soviet people absolutely trust their Party, because they know that the Party is serving the people and the happiness of the people, and the Party is working tirelessly to strengthen our socialist country.

    The best sons and daughters of the Soviet people join the Communist Party, and in the ranks of the Party, under the banner of the Party, they work and fight to realize the most sublime ideals of mankind. An increasing number of working people are joining the Party. In fact, if the CPSU admitted 736,000 members in the three years between the 19th and 20th Congresses, then it admitted more than one million members in the less than three years between the 20th and 21st Congresses. In 1958 alone, more than 480,000 new members joined the Party. No year since the war has seen so many members admitted. Although we have some control over the development of Party members, only a portion of those who apply to join the Party are admitted.

    Our Party is entering a new historical development period of the Soviet state. It is a powerful, united Party, armed with the rich experience of socialist construction, and proficient in the Bolshevik art of organizing and politically leading the masses.

    In order to successfully complete the great indicators of the Seven-Year Plan, we must raise the Party's organizational and political work among the masses to a higher level. The Seven-Year Plan should become the fighting program of action for every primary Party organization and every Communist Party member. The national planned figures of the Soviet Union should be specifically reflected in the indicators and quotas that every worker, collective farmer, engineer, agronomist, staff member, and the entire enterprise, construction site, collective farm, state farm, and scientific institution will strive to implement. Each of them and each unit should find its place, determine its tasks and roles in the common great labor of the Soviet people to realize the Seven-Year Plan. It is in this regard that the Party's primary organizations should play a huge organizational role. Our glorious Leninist Communist Youth League also plays a huge role in this regard. We must strictly abide by the requirements of the law of planned development of the economy. All the nationalities of the Soviet Union will move to communism side by side at the same time.

    Comrades! As long as we carefully think about the magnificent figures of the Seven-Year Plan, a magnificent vision of our country's further growth and development will unfold before our eyes, as well as the complex and enormous tasks that we will accomplish.

    The Party pointed out that in order to realize the huge qualitative changes in our economy, it is necessary to strictly abide by the requirements of the economic law of planned (proportional) development of the national economy. The structure of many sectors of the national economy will change, and the map of the configuration of Soviet productive forces will undergo major changes. Such a proportion and economic development speed between the various sectors of the socialist economy has been established in order to maximize the increase in industrial and agricultural production.

    The report pointed out how important the chemical industry, especially the production of synthetic materials, will be and how rapidly it will develop, and how huge changes will take place in the fuel industry. Everyone is very clear that our country has huge reserves of oil and gas. Many extremely large deposits have long been explored. However, it is a pity that all these wealths have not been fully utilized until recently. Only in recent years have measures been taken to make these wealths serve the people.

    This convincingly shows how the Party is skillfully and wisely using huge internal potential and possibilities as a master to further develop our productive forces and benefit the working people.

    For example, let us take the machine manufacturing industry. Its main direction is to manufacture machines that can guarantee the technological development of various sectors of the national economy in the future. Nuclear energy, radioactive isotopes, radio electronics, semiconductors, and all the latest scientific and technological achievements will be used more and more widely in industry, transportation, and other sectors of our economy.

    The high technical equipment of the national economy can greatly increase social labor productivity. And this, as we know, is the most important and main condition for the victory of communist society.

    No sector of the national economy will not see a huge leap towards a higher quality development.

    The magnificent program for the comprehensive development of communist construction in our country, which was formulated from a creative Marxist-Leninist standpoint and described by N.S. Khrushchev in his report, is permeated with the Party's concern for further enhancing the powerful strength of the Soviet state and improving the people's lives.

    Comrades! The draft Seven-Year Plan points out the ways for the further development of the economy and culture of the Soviet Republics. The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that the allocation of productive forces should first conform to the interests of the whole country, and at the same time take into account the need to make every Soviet Republic prosper. From this we can clearly see that our Party is wisely implementing the Leninist national policy. It is precisely because of the correct solution of the national question that the Party has eliminated the inequality in economic and socio-political development of the various nationalities in our country caused by the rule of landlords and capitalists, and guaranteed the great leap forward of the national republics on the road of economic and cultural development.

    Now, all the nationalities of the Soviet Union, as the report emphasized, regardless of the level of their economic, socio-political, and cultural development before the revolution, are shoulder to shoulder and at the same time realizing the transition from socialism to communism.

    The Party unites the various nationalities of the Soviet state in a unified fraternal family, making them live in harmony with each other. The people of our country, no matter which nationality they belong to, or in which union republic they live and work, are close to each other due to those new human qualities and new character. These new qualities and character are cultivated by the Communist Party, while the world of exploitation and oppression deprives people of these new qualities and character. These qualities are: heroism and self-sacrifice in labor and struggle, collectivism, mutual assistance and mutual help, the tenacity of never giving up until the goal is achieved, and unlimited confidence in the justice of our great cause. Unlimited loyalty to the cause of communism and hatred for the enemies of the people - this is the characteristic that determines the face of the Soviet people.

    The vigorous strength of the fraternal unity among the working people of the various union republics is expressed in various forms. This is particularly manifested in solving tasks with national significance for the whole people. Without the assistance of other union republics, could Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic republics have restored their national economy destroyed by the war so smoothly and quickly? Also, without the assistance of other fraternal nationalities, could the Kazakh people have reclaimed such a vast area of virgin land in such a short period of time? No, of course not. This is the fruit of the labor and struggle of the whole people, the crystallization of the friendship of all nationalities.

    In the history of human society, there has never been such an example as our Soviet Union, where the people of dozens of nationalities live in such a close-knit fraternal family, they have unified aspirations, they have no shadows of mutual distrust, and they are building their beloved country without barriers. (Applause)

    The Soviet people, educated in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, treat the people of all socialist countries with lofty fraternal feelings, and treat the people of all countries who are fighting for peace and socialism.

    The various nationalities of the Soviet Union, united in a unified family, are united by an unbreakable friendship during the period of comprehensive development of communist society construction, and are determined to gloriously complete the plan for new great achievements on the road to the complete victory of communism. The friendship of all nationalities - this is the extremely great achievement of our Party.
  (Applause) Cadres play a decisive role in completing the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan. We must strictly abide by Lenin's principles in selecting and arranging cadres.

    Comrades! The decisive role in realizing the magnificent tasks that the Party has put forward to the Soviet people in this Seven-Year Plan, as N.S. Khrushchev pointed out in his report, will belong to our cadres. Everyone knows that the success of any cause ultimately depends on the people who are engaged in this cause, and who leads this or that job position. Our Party has cultivated professional cadres for all departments of the national economy and culture, and Party and state organs. A group of outstanding local cadres has grown up in the union republics. However, this must not be any basis for weakening cadre work. However, individual leaders mistakenly believe that since the country's cause is progressing well and the Party has won great achievements in communist construction, then there will not be any particularly noteworthy issues in cadre work now. Obviously, this view is incorrect and harmful.

    The magnificent tasks of the Seven-Year Plan require us not to reduce, but to increase the requirements for Party and state leading cadres. Our entire cadre work should be raised to a higher level to adapt to the new tasks put forward by the Party to the whole country.

    The report talked about the importance of cadre work. I would also like to talk about a few issues in this regard. For example, let's talk about such an issue. Current life requires that there should be more experts and people who are proficient in various economic sectors among Party, Soviet, economic, and trade union leading cadres.

    For example, it is best for those who lead agricultural areas to have agricultural education, to be familiar with agricultural production, or to be outstanding practical workers with organizational skills and proficient business experience. It is important that, for example, in cities where machine manufacturing accounts for a large proportion, the secretary of the municipal Party committee should be an expert in this sector, or a person who is familiar with the business and practically engaged in machine manufacturing work. Those who lead scientific organs must be people who are proficient in the science studied by the organ, and the same is true for other departments. We have many outstanding, politically mature, experienced practical workers, teachers, doctors, and experts in other various knowledge departments, who can and must be promoted to leading positions.

    Therefore, the issue is to widely open the door in order to promote people with higher education and practical workers with rich life experience and prestige among the working people to leadership positions in Party, state, economic, and other work.

    This is of great significance for organizing the struggle to complete the Seven-Year Plan of the national economy and culture. We must treat the issue of selecting cadres reasonably, according to the interests of the country, and strictly abide by Lenin's principles of selecting and arranging cadres.

    As pointed out in the report, we still have such leaders who have the kind of fear of promoting young staff members that the Party has criticized. Such leaders are willing to transfer a staff member from one place to another again and again, rather than promote a new person. Their idea is probably this: Who knows this new young man? Can he do the job, can he be competent for the work assigned to him? After promoting him, he will have to deal with this young man.

    These leaders have forgotten that many of them were also promoted by the Party to responsible positions when they were thirty to thirty-five years old. They have forgotten that the strength of our Party lies in the fact that it can often replenish its ranks with new, young, and vigorous cadres, and promote them to lead Party and state work.

    Therefore, we should more boldly promote young people who have shown foresight, ability, and unlimited loyalty to our great cause and organizational skills in basic-level work. Even if these staff members have not fully mastered the art of leadership, this can be obtained later. As the report said, at the same time, we should also carefully and caringly treat those honest cadres who have contributed to the entire communist construction cause through many years of hard work.

    The issue of cultivating a group of cadres who will be prepared to assume leadership work in the future is also of great significance. We sometimes treat this important work only as compiling a list of so-called reserve personnel. After compiling such a list, we think that the work of organizing the cadre reserve team has been all right. This is of course incorrect. This attitude towards organizing the cadre reserve team is bureaucratic and formalistic. In actual life, there are often such things: the list is there, but when it is necessary to promote a person to a certain job, the person needed cannot be found.

    Where is the problem? The key lies in the fact that some Party organizations still do not attach great importance to the work of examining cadres. We often do not pay attention to some outstanding figures who work in enterprises, institutions, and social organizations. We often cannot see that many of them can be promoted to more important positions and can be boldly promoted to leadership work.

    The most suitable candidates for promoting to chairman of the executive committee, factory director, chairman of the collective farm, and leaders of other Soviet and economic organs should be the deputies of these leaders, and the candidates for promoting to the first secretary of the Party district committee, municipal committee, and state committee should be the second secretary. But unfortunately, this is often not the case. In many organizations, it is very rare to promote the second secretary of the Party committee and the deputy leaders of various organs to the position of first leader. The main reason for this phenomenon is that when promoting staff members to the vice chairman of the Soviet and the second secretary of the Party organ, and promoting staff members to other leading organs, some staff members were selected without considering the prospects for their further promotion, and sometimes even for the simple purpose of placing a person. People say, let him be the vice chairman of the executive committee. Anyway, he has taken office, and there is nothing to approve! (Applause, laughter) However, this practice can only be harmful to the work.

    I would also like to talk about the following matter. This kind of thing has appeared in our country a long time ago and has become a tradition: we train professional cadres in various departments for some republics and states in Moscow, Leningrad, or other large central areas in the country, and these cadres can be well trained locally. What will be the result of this? For example, we train such experts in Moscow in order to send them to the Far East, then various additional allowances need to be paid to them for "special" working conditions, such as climatic conditions, etc. In general, it is indeed difficult to send this kind of person from Moscow or Leningrad to Boly or Yakutia. They prefer it here. Wouldn't it be better to train and train cadres locally who are familiar with local conditions and do not need to adapt to the environment and local climate. Undoubtedly, this would be of greater benefit to the work. All cadres must devote enormous creative labor and not fall behind the rapid pace of life.

    The magnificent Seven-Year Plan planned by the Party requires us all cadres to devote enormous creative labor. Comrades, we have a lot of work to do! Our strength and organizational skills can be maximized and developed!

    We have started a great historical cause - a peaceful competition with the capitalist United States. We should catch up with and surpass it in all aspects. And we must do this no matter what! (Applause)

    We need to complete such complex tasks and do so much work in front of us. This requires every staff member, no matter what his position is, to put out the greatest energy, give full play to the greatest initiative and organizational skills, in order to be able to gloriously shoulder the work assigned to him, and not fall behind life, not fall behind the rapid pace of life, and be able to reach the level of new and greater requirements and tasks.

    N.S. Khrushchev: Alexei Illarionovich, can I add something to your speech? I think this addition will not disrupt the correct direction you put forward in your speech.

    You correctly talked about the Far East, about some problems related to sending cadres there, and about some so-called "allowances" for working in difficult conditions.

    Isn't it time for us to abolish the different treatment of the Far East and other places that are far away but are closest to all of us? Therefore, wouldn't it be reasonable to pull out the "allowances" attached to the basic salary? (Sustained applause)

    Audience voice: Yes.

    N.S. Khrushchev: Comrades! The Far East, in terms of natural conditions, is the pearl of our country. But in the past, it was indeed too far away from us. It took almost half a year to ride a horse to get there, and it took two weeks to take a train. But now it only takes us six to eight hours to fly there from Moscow, have breakfast here, and then have lunch in the Far East. Is this still far? It is no longer "far", but close at hand. (Lively atmosphere in the hall, applause) As for the climatic conditions, grapes can grow in some areas there. Take Sakhalin Island, for example, it is simply a fascinating place! The same is true for some cities in Siberia, or Yakutia! In these places, there is a vibrant, hardworking, and beautiful life everywhere.

    But what has the "allowance" produced? If a Yakutian is born locally, then he gets one kind of salary. If he is a Yakutian from the central region of our country, then he gets another kind of remuneration for the same job. Therefore, some Yakutian comrades jokingly suggested to me that let's arrange it like this now, as long as a Yakutian is born, then give him some more salary immediately, because he was born in Yakutia. (Laughter in the hall, applause)

    If we maintain this allowance, then we are equal to discriminating against some good and richest areas of the Soviet Union. These areas have good climates. Even patients often go there, for example, to the Yenisei River for recuperation.

    Comrades, please forgive me for this addition. But my idea has been brewing for a long time, so I took the opportunity of Comrade Kirichenko's speech to tell it. (Lively atmosphere in the hall, storm-like applause).

    A.I. Kirichenko: Nikita Sergeyevich, you did not interrupt me, on the contrary, I thank you and completely agree with this addition. This addition enriched my speech. (Lively atmosphere in the hall)

    Communist Ideas Have Occupied a Dominant Position in the World
    The Capitalist Suppuration and Decaying Face Cannot Be Concealed

    Comrades! The victories achieved by the various nationalities of the Soviet Union and the work we are going to complete in the Seven-Year Plan are the great embodiment of the invincible communist ideas. As the report clearly pointed out, in our era, communist ideas have become the dominant ideas in the world. For communist ideas, there are no boundaries and borders to block them. They touch people's hearts with their vibrant power and truth.

    The unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over capitalism is increasingly revolutionizing the working people of capitalist countries, colonies, and dependencies. Seeing this, the bourgeois theorists and the right-wing socialists who are in the same vein as them are worried about the fate of their masters, so they try to cover up the capitalist suppuration and diseases, put on makeup for its decaying face, and dress it in new clothes. Recently, many different kinds of "theories" and schemes for "improving" capitalism to make it a "prosperous system" have appeared. The bourgeois theorists and right-wing socialists try to deceive the working people and advocate the idea of evolution, propagating that modern capitalism can be transformed into some form of socialism. They talk a lot about the "transformation of capitalism" and the renewal of capitalism.

    For example, Paul Ramadier, one of the right-wing socialist thinkers, insisted that in the current capitalist society, "state supervision, national planning, and even worker supervision are increasingly expanding." This enterprise-style capitalism, which Paul Ramadier calls, has no connection with private capital except for its origin. Paul Ramadier's ode to modern capitalism ends with the following question, he said, "Have we actually started to build a new type of socialism without realizing it ourselves?" At the same time, he also clamored: "The time has come for us to re-determine and announce our ideas."

    But no matter how devoted they are, they will not hatch any new ideas. Because as the saying goes, "Hens cannot hatch eagles." No matter what ideas the bourgeois theorists "determine" and "announce," they cannot save capitalism. Capitalism is outdated, it has been exhausted spiritually and morally, and it cannot progress in any way.

    Communism is full of energy. It destroys the chains of capitalist rule one by one, awakens the people of all countries to a new life, and opens up a bright future for them.

    Just forty years ago, only the Russian working class had its own Marxist-Leninist communist workers' party. These 400,000 Russian revolutionaries - Bolsheviks, who were cultivated and led by V.I. Lenin, led the Russian workers to attack the old world. At that time, the communist parties in other countries had just begun to step onto the historical stage under the influence of the Great October Revolution. In the early years after the Great October Revolution, the number of communist parties in capitalist countries was only a little more than twenty, with less than 500,000 members.

    Today, the international communist movement and the workers' movement have grown into a powerful force that truly makes capitalism fear. As the report pointed out, the Marxist-Leninist communist and workers' parties around the world now have 33 million of the most heroic, honest, self-sacrificing, and loyal sons and daughters of the working people to the cause of communism. The Marxist-Leninist communist and workers' parties are the conscience of progressive humanity, the heralds of a great future, and the builders of a new world.

    The youth communist force is growing year by year. Only three or four decades ago, the world communist youth organizations had only hundreds of thousands of members. Now, more than 60 million revolutionary young people are united under the banner of communism in these organizations. The imperialist colonial system is on the verge of collapse. The oppressed people will completely eliminate the remnants of colonialism.

    Communist ideas are embodied in the struggle to defend peace and the vigorously developing national liberation movement of the oppressed people. V.I. Lenin once predicted: "The historical tomorrow of the whole world will be the day when the awakened peoples oppressed by imperialism are completely awakened and begin a resolute, long-term, and arduous

    苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员
    基里钦科在苏共二十一次代表大会上的发言
    新华社4日讯　据“真理报”报道，苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员基里钦科1月31日上午在苏共第二十一次代表大会上的发言，全文如下：
    同志们！我们代表大会非常注意地听取了尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫同志的报告。这个报告总结了苏联共产党和苏联人民在争取巩固苏维埃国家的政治和经济力量的斗争中所获得的光辉胜利。报告对苏维埃社会所发生的伟大的、
  富有生命力的过程作了全面的马克思列宁主义的分析，阐明了进一步发展我国经济的迫切需要，并对从社会主义过渡到共产主义的某些极重大的问题作了深刻的理论探讨。
    党的第二十一次代表大会是社会主义社会开始向新的、更高的发展阶段作强有力的上升的里程碑，是苏联人民沿着通向共产主义的道路急剧跃进的里程碑。
    在评价苏联人民所获得的伟大成就的结果时，可以毫不夸张地说，在过去五年内，特别是在第二十次代表大会召开后的几年来，我们国家已登上了一个高峰，从这里展开了宽广的视野，看到了全面展开共产主义社会建设的宏伟的七年计划的令人喜悦的前景。过去的五年是苏联现在进入新历史时期的良好的开端。
    党坚决地扫除一切阻碍前进的腐朽的东西
  粉碎反党集团是实现列宁主义的重大胜利
    我国一切巨大的成就都是党的巨大的组织工作、党的领导和指导作用、党的有远见的、灵活的和正确的列宁主义政策的结果。党发展和创造性地运用马克思列宁主义理论，同时又大胆地和革命地坚决从道路上扫除一切阻碍我们前进的腐朽过时的东西。大家回忆一下，中央委员会曾经受到马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团多么猛烈的攻击，这个集团反对中央委员会为了使国家经济进一步高涨、使人民物质福利进一步提高所采取的重大措施，以及在其他一些问题上的重大措施。
    中央委员会遵循着党的第二十次代表大会的决议，尽最大力量来铲除一切脱离列宁主义的倾向，广泛地为群众的创造性所产生出的一切新的、进步的现象开辟道路，并完全列宁式地建立党和国家的全部生活。但是正是在这个时候，反党集团的参加者企图使我们转向遭到党的第二十次党代表大会所谴责的道路。
    同志们，我应该说，反党集团的参加者在斯大林逝世后就开始几乎在中央主席团每次会议上攻击从列宁学说出发、从生活出发的有关领导国家、建设武装力量和外交政策等问题的一切新东西。不过，他们特别反对和开始猛烈攻击第二十次代表大会后党的总路线。反党集团撕下了面具，在1957年6月18日有组织地反对党的第二十次代表大会所制订的方针，当时，这个集团的参加者对自己在中央委员会主席团中的力量作了估计，他们得出结论，似乎他们拥有力量来改变党和政府的政策。大家知道，这件事的结局如何。我们离开反党集团企图使我们党脱离自己的总路线、企图分裂党的队伍的列宁主义的团结的日子愈远，就愈加清楚地可以看到这些政治阴谋家和两面派的分裂活动的全部卑鄙性，以及他们想把我们国家和我们党引上的那条道路的全部危害性。
    应当肯定地说，苏共中央委员会、我们的党粉碎了反党集团，在为实现列宁主义总路线、为把马克思列宁主义创造性地运用到共产主义建设实践中去的斗争中取得了重大胜利。（掌声）
    大家都知道，这些卑鄙的教条主义者干了些什么。他们深深地陷入了保守主义的泥坑，他们别有用心地寻章摘句，不去考虑他们已经脱离了生气蓬勃的真正的马克思列宁主义、脱离人民的生活、脱离把理论变成物质力量的一切已经有多远。弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁谈到这类人的时候说：“……他……一点也不懂得政治经济学，只是抓住引文，像一个脑袋里装着引文卡片的学者一样，一旦遇到书中没有谈到的新问题，就束手无策，拿出恰恰不该拿出的引文来”（列宁全集俄文本第二十九卷第三三五页，中文本第三二七页）。（全场活跃）
    大家知道，一个真正的马克思列宁主义者不仅要通晓马克思主义哲学规律，而且要善于把这些规律运用到实践中去，善于把这些规律正确地运用到生活中去；不仅要很好地掌握马克思关于资本主义的政治经济学的各个范畴，而且也要清楚地知道社会主义的经济规律，并善于把它们运用到有利于社会主义社会发展和为人民造福的方面去。一个真正的马克思列宁主义者不仅要研究并认识本国人民的过去，而且还要清楚而深刻地了解劳动人民今天的生活，深刻关心今天的生活，经常感到它的脉搏并善于瞻望未来，善于拟定社会发展的远景。列宁说：“……马克思主义者必须考虑生动的实际生活，必须考虑现实的确切事实……”，他还常常给大家引用一个著名的佳句：“我的朋友，理论是黯淡的，而生活之树是常青的”（列宁全集俄文本第二十四卷第二十六页，中文本第二十五页）。
    党中央委员会在最近几年内的全部活动
    是创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的榜样
    我们今天可以十分满意地指出，党中央委员会正是从创造性的马克
  思列宁主义的立场出发，从苏联人民的利益出发，并考虑到实际环境和具体情况来解决国内和国际政策的各种问题以及共产主义建设过程中的各项任务。现在就连最顽固的怀疑派也看到，我们党的中央委员会是多么正确，多么有远见，它接二连三地实现了全国性的重大措施，这些措施不仅具有政治意义和经济意义，而且具有重要的理论意义。
    我们拿改组工业和建筑业管理问题为例。只要评价一下改组的结果，就必须说，改组对于工业和社会主义经济其他部门的发展起了真正的革命作用，完全达到了预期的目的。我们的工业从来还没有过像现在这样的高涨。大家知道，在几个五年计划的年代里，苏维埃国家的工业获得了蓬勃的发展。然而，某些工业部门的工作并不经常是均衡的。比如，在一些年内，煤炭、冶金、铁矿和其他一些工业部门没有完成计划。同志们，大家可以回想一下，曾经就这个问题通过了多少决议，有多少电报、指令、指示像雪片般地飞往企业，中央和地方为这些问题作过多少努力。紧急动员和突击接二连三地进行，然而，事情的进展却很缓慢，我们并不是一直取得了预期的结果的。
    现在的情形怎么样呢？所有的工业部门，包括那些过去不稳定的、工作时断时续的部门，今天都在顺利地完成自己的任务。甚至像大家都还记得的多年来一直成为话柄的森林工业，去年也提前完成了年度计划，这使我们大家感到高兴。
    由此可见，经验表明，党对过去的经济领导方式方法所实行的根本改革是完全正确和适时的。这一改革激发了新的、空前未有的力量，创造了极其有利的条件来最大限度地发挥社会主义生产方式中所具有的大量内部潜力和可能性，以便使我国国民经济一日千里地向前发展。
    同志们！党和党中央委员会的创造性作用和组织作用在胜利完成急剧发展农业的任务方面特别有力地表现出来。大家都知道，就在几年以前，我国农业生产是处在怎么样的一种状况。那时，国内粮食不够，肉、牛奶、油脂、糖、蔬菜和其他必要食品都感到严重不足。
    农业上发生这种情况的原因何在？要知道，过去我们的农业中也有出色的集体农民大军在劳动，也有富有经验的领导干部、机器操使者和农艺师。在1953年以前，我国农业也装备有拖拉机、收割联合机和其他机器。在哈萨克和西伯利亚也有着自古以来的荒地。问题在于：社会主义经济的巨大潜力利用得极不好。负责领导国内农业的人远离农业，不懂得农业生产。他们无论到那里，不同人们交往，不同人们商量，不看农村中所发生的过程，以老爷式的不负责任的态度对待集体农庄和集体农民的需要。
    苏共中央九月全会的历史意义就在于：这次会议对国内农业的实际情况作了正确的估价，拟定了急剧发展农业生产的全面纲领，并且集中了党和人民的力量来解决这个任务。现在大家都看到，农村中发生了多么惊人的变化。集体农民和全体人民都非常满意地谈到这些措施，谈到这些措施对巩固集体农庄制度的有效影响。集体农庄农村中的生活开始好得多了，富裕得多了，工作的情况也不同了。集体农民以更大的热情和积极性劳动着。我们农业上的成就是有目共睹的，全体人民，每一个苏联劳动者都看到了这些成就。
    同志们，这就是我们党的活生生的改造力量和组织作用、我们党的决议的影响在实际中的表现，党的这些决议是在深刻地研究实践和人民群众的经验的基础上，在对我国生活和建设的实际过程进行理论总结的基础上通过的。
    我们党中央委员会在最近几年内的全部活动生动地证明了党的列宁主义的智慧，善于找到中心环节，抓住这个环节就能顺利解决党的建设、国家建设和经济建设的极重要问题。苏共第二十次代表大会以后在苏维埃国家中所完成的一切，是我党在实践中创造性地运用马克思列宁主义学说的榜样，是对永远新的、永远充满生命力的关于人类社会发展规律的学说——马克思列宁主义宝库的巨大贡献。（掌声）
    我们党和人民的成就实在巨大。理应指出苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在提出和阐明我们党和苏维埃国家许多重要的理论上和实际活动中重大问题方面的卓越工作，他的列宁式的坚定性、原则性和主动性，以及他的巨大组织工作。（掌声）
    同志们！苏共第二十次代表大会开辟了我们党的生活和发展中的新阶段，标志着列宁思想、列宁关于党的学说的胜利。第二十次代表大会以后，我们党的全部生活和活动特别充满了巨大的创造内容，充满了具有真正历史意义的事件。
    党和人民之间团结一致
      是不可摧毁的堡垒
    党在群众中的组织工作
      要提高到更高水平
    中央委员会在执行苏共第二十次代表大会的决议时，实现了一系列措施，来消灭个人迷信的影响，恢复党的队伍内对列宁的党的生活准则的严格遵守和集体领导的原则，广泛发展党的建设中列宁主义的根本原则之一——党内民主。这些措施大大地提高了党员群众的积极性和主动性，提高了党组织和我们全党的战斗性。共产党员对企业、集体农庄、机关中工作情况的责任感加强了，基层党组织的生活变得更加活跃了，它们组织工作的水平更高了。各级党组织根本上改变了工作方式和对经济建设领导的方法，坚决地丢掉了过时的和不适应新要求、新任务的一切东西。它们处理生产问题更加深入、更加熟练了。
    党和人民之间的团结一致是不可摧毁的堡垒。许多社会主义敌人的幻想和阴谋诡计在这个堡垒上已不止一次地被碰得粉碎。我们党更加加强了与人民的团结，因为党认为坚定不移地实现列宁的下述遗训是自己的神圣职责，即必须和人民保持紧密的联系，在领导群众的时候不但要教导群众，而且要向群众学习。把一切有全国意义的最重要的问题提交全民讨论，就是这方面的明显表现之一。在决定重大问题之前，中央委员会同人民商讨，听取苏联人民的意见、他们的建议、批评和希望。全国先进人士，党、苏维埃和经济机关、大企业、集体农庄的负责人，科学家，工程技术人员，以及其他工作人员经常被邀请参加中央全会和党中央就各种重要问题举行的会议。党在通过关于改组工业和建筑业管理、关于改组机器拖拉机站、关于加强学校同生活的联系、关于目前党代表大会上讨论的七年计划控制数字的各项决议时，都是这样做的。
    难道这不是有力地证明了党同群众之间联系的加强，令人信服地证明了，如列宁所指出的，苏维埃社会主义制度保证广泛地吸引人民“……经常地，不断地而且决定性地参加对国家的民主管理”。
    党实行的扩大加盟共和国和地方党政机关权力的措施，对于在我国进一步发扬苏维埃民主具有重大的意义。这些措施已对促进加盟共和国经济和文化的高涨及巩固苏维埃社会制度产生了极其有利的影响。党经常关心的是严格遵守社会主义法制和保护苏联公民的权利和利益。苏联最高苏维埃通过的一批新的巩固我国社会主义法律秩序的法令，在这方面将具有重大的意义。正如尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志报告中所说的，在我们这里现在没有由于政治原因而被关在监狱里的人。全体人民都知道并且感觉到这样的情况，即我国的革命法制已经恢复，人们丝毫不苟地遵守革命法制，违犯革命法制的人遭到了揭发和严厉的制裁。（掌声）
    同志们，共产党的列宁主义政策正确地反映出苏联人民的根本利益，它是我国社会的生存基础。苏联人民绝对信任自己的党，因为他们知道党是在为人民、为人民的幸福服务，党坚持不懈地为加强我们的社会主义国家而竭力工作。
    参加共产党的是苏联人民的优秀儿女，他们在党的队伍中，在党的旗帜下，为实现人类最崇高的理想而工作和斗争。参加党的劳动群众日益增多。实际上，如果说在第十九次和第二十次代表大会之间的三年多时间内，苏共吸收了七十三万六千名党员，那末在第二十次和第二十一次代表大会之间不到三年的时间里则吸收了一百多万党员。仅仅1958年一年，新入党的就有四十八万多人。战后以来没有哪一年吸收过这么多的党员。虽然我们对发展党员有所控制，吸收的只是要求入党的人当中的一部分。
    我们的党正在进入苏维埃国家新的历史发展的新的时期，它是一个强大的、团结一致的、用社会主义建设的丰富经验武装起来的、精通布尔什维克对群众进行组织和政治领导艺术的党。
    为了胜利地完成七年计划的伟大指标，我们必须把党在群众中的组织和政治工作提高到更高的水平。七年计划应当成为党的每个基层组织和每个共产党员的战斗的行动纲领。苏联全国性的计划数字应该具体地反映在每个工人、集体农民、工程师、农学家、职员以及整个企业、建筑工地、集体农庄、国营农场和科学机关将要努力执行的指标和定额中。他们每个人和每个单位都应该在苏联人民实现七年计划的共同的伟大劳动中找到自己的位置，确定自己的任务和作用。正是在这方面党的基层组织应起巨大的组织作用。我们光荣的列宁共青团在这方面也有巨大的作用。要严格遵守有计划发展的经济规律的要求苏联各族人民将并肩同时过渡到共产主义
    同志们！只要我们仔细地想一想七年计划的宏伟的数字，我们眼前就会展开一幅我国进一步成长和发展的壮阔远景，以及我们将要完成的那些复杂而又巨大的任务。
    党指出实现我国经济方面巨大的质的变化，要严格遵守国民经济有计划（按比例）发展的经济规律的要求。国民经济的许多部门的结构将发生变化，苏联生产力配置的地图将起重大的变化。确立了社会主义经济各个部门之间的这种比例和经济发展速度，以便最大限度地增加工农业生产。
    报告中指出，如化学工业，特别是合成材料的生产，将具有何等重要的意义并将获得何等迅速的发展，燃料工业将发生何等巨大的变化。大家都很清楚，我国拥有巨大的石油和瓦斯的蕴藏量。许多极大的矿床早已被勘探出来。但是，遗憾的是所有这些财富不久以前都还没有被充分地加以利用。只有最近几年才采取措施，使这些财富服务于人民。
    这令人信服地表明，党是如何干练而又英明地以主人翁的态度利用巨大的内在潜力和可能性来进一步发展我国的生产力和造福劳动人民。
    例如拿机器制造业来说吧，它的主要方向是制造能保证今后国民经济各部门的技术发展的机器。在工业、运输业和我国经济的其它部门中将会愈来愈广泛地运用核能、放射性同位素、无线电电子学、半导体和一切最新的科学技术成就。
    国民经济的高度的技术装备可以大大地提高社会劳动生产率。而这一点，正如我们所知道的，是共产主义社会胜利最重要和最主要的条件。
    没有任何一个国民经济部门不出现向更高的质态发展的巨大跃进。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在报告中所叙述的、以创造性的马克思列宁主义立场制定的我国全面展开共产主义建设的宏伟纲领，贯穿着党对进一步增强苏维埃国家的强大威力和改善人民生活的关怀。
    同志们！在七年计划草案中指出了各苏维埃共和国经济和文化进一步发展的途径。七年计划中规定生产力的配置要首先符合全国的利益，同时也考虑到有必要使每一个苏维埃共和国繁荣起来。我们从这里可以明显地看到我党英明地实现了列宁主义的民族政策。正是由于正确地解决了民族问题，党才消除了由地主资本家统治所产生的我国各民族在经济和社会政治发展上的不平等现象，保证了各民族共和国在经济和文化发展道路上的巨大跃进。
    现在，苏联各族人民，正如报告所强调指出的，不论在革命前他们的经济、社会政治和文化的发展处于怎样的水平，都肩并肩地同时在实现从社会主义到共产主义的过渡。
    党把苏维埃国家的各族人民团结在一个统一的兄弟大家庭里，使他们友好相处。我国人民不论他们属于哪一个民族，或是在哪一个加盟共和国里生活和劳动，都由那些新的人类品质、新的性格而彼此接近起来。这些新的品质和性格是共产党教育他们养成的，而剥削和压迫的世界则剥夺了人的这些新的品质和性格。这些品质就是：在劳动和斗争中的英雄气概和自我献身精神、集体主义、互助和互相救助、不达目的决不罢休的顽强性，以及对我们伟大事业的正义性的无限信心。无限地忠于共产主义事业和对人民敌人的仇恨，——这就是决定苏维埃人的面貌的特征。
    各加盟共和国劳动人民间兄弟般团结的生气勃勃的力量，表现在各种不同的形式中。这特别表现在解决具有全民的全国性意义的任务中。如果没有其它加盟共和国的援助，难道乌克兰、白俄罗斯和波罗的海沿岸各共和国能够如此顺利和迅速地恢复战争所破坏的国民经济吗？还有，如果没有其它兄弟民族的援助，难道哈萨克人民自己能够在如此短促的时期内开垦出极广大的生荒地吗？不，当然是做不到的。这是全民劳动和斗争的果实，是各族人民友好的结晶。
    在人类社会的历史上从来没有过像我们苏联这样的例子，即几十个民族的人民生活在这样一个亲密无间的兄弟般的大家庭里，他们有着统一的志向，他们毫无互不信任的阴影，他们毫无隔阂地在建设自己的亲爱的国家。（掌声）
    受无产阶级国际主义精神教育的苏联人民，以崇高的兄弟般友好的感情对待各社会主义国家的人民，对待为争取和平和社会主义而斗争的各国人民。
    结成统一大家庭的苏联各族人民，在全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期，以牢不可破的友谊团结在一起，决心光荣地完成在走向共产主义完全胜利的道路上的新的伟大成就的计划。各族人民友好——这是我们党的极其伟大的成就。
  （掌声）干部在完成七年计划任务中起决定性作用应当严格遵守列宁的原则挑选和安排干部
    同志们！在实现党在这次七年计划中给苏联人民提出的宏伟的任务中起决定性作用的，如尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在报告中所指出，将属于我们的干部。大家知道，任何事业的成功归根到底总是取决于担任这个事业的人，以及什么人来领导这一或那一工作岗位。我们党给国民经济和文化的各部门、党和国家的机关培养了精通业务的干部。在各加盟共和国成长了一批出色的地方干部。但是，这决不能成为削弱干部工作的任何根据。然而，个别的领导人错误地认为，既然国家的事业进展得很好，而党又在共产主义建设中赢得了巨大的成就，那末现在干部工作中就不会有任何特别值得注意的问题了。显然，这种意见是不正确的，是有害的。
    七年计划的宏伟任务要我们不仅不减低，相反要提高对党和国家领导干部的要求。我们的整个干部工作应当提到更高的水平，使其适应党向全国提出的新任务。
    报告中谈到了干部工作的重要性。在这方面我也想谈几个问题。譬如就谈谈这样一个问题吧。目前的生活要求党、苏维埃、经济和工会的领导干部中间要有更多的专家和精通各种经济部门业务的人。
    例如，领导农业地区的人最好是受过农业教育，是熟悉农业生产的人，或者是具有组织才能精通业务的、有经验的优秀实际工作者。重要的是，例如，在机器制造业占有很大比重的城市，市党委书记应当是这个部门的专家，或者是熟悉业务、实际从事机器制造工作的人。领导科学机关的，必须是精通该机关所研究的那门科学的人，其他部门也是如此。我们有很多优秀的、政治上成熟的、经验丰富的实际工作者、教师、医生和其他各种知识部门的专家，这些人可以、并且必须提拔到领导工作岗位上来。
    因此，问题是要广开大门，以便把受过高等教育的人和具有丰富的生活经验、并在劳动人民中间享有威信的实际工作者提拔到党、国家、经济以及其他工作的领导职位上去。
    这对于组织为完成国民经济和文化各部门七年计划的斗争，具有十分重大的意义。应当合理地，根据国家的利益，并严格遵守列宁的挑选和安排干部的原则来对待挑选干部的问题。
    正像报告中所指出的，我们还有这样的领导人，他们对提拔年轻工作人员抱有党所指责过的那种畏惧心理。这样的领导人情愿把一个工作人员一而再地从一个地方调到另一个地方，而不愿意提拔一个新人。他们的想法大概是这样的：有谁了解这个新的年青人呢？他工作得了吗，能胜任交给他的工作吗。提拔了他以后就得和这个年青人打交道。
    这些领导人忘记了，他们之中许多人当年也是在三十到三十五岁的时候就被党提拔到负责职位上来的，他们忘记了，我们党的力量就在于它经常能把新的、年青的、生气勃勃的干部补充到自己的队伍里来，提拔他们来领导党和国家的工作。
    因此，应当更大胆地提拔那些在基层工作中已经表现出有远见、有能力并无限忠诚于我们伟大事业和具有组织才能的青年人。即使这些工作人员还没有完全掌握领导艺术，但是这是可以随后求得的。正像报告中所说的，同时还应当细心地、关怀地对待那些正直的、因多年辛勤劳动而对整个共产主义建设事业有过贡献的干部。
    关于培养一批将来准备担任领导工作的干部的问题，也具有重要的意义。我们有时把这件重要的工作只当成是编造所谓后备人员的名册。编造了这类名册之后就认为组织干部后备队的工作已经万事大吉了。这当然是不正确的。对待组织干部后备队的这种态度是官僚主义和形式主义的。实际生活中常常有这样的事：名册倒是有的，可是当需要提拔一个人担任某项工作的时候，却又找不到需要的人。
    问题在哪里呢？关键在于一些党组织对考察干部的工作仍然很不重视。我们往往没有注意到一些在企业、机关和社会团体中工作的优秀人物。我们常常看不出他们中的许多人是可以担任更重要的职务，可以被大胆地提拔作领导工作的。
    提升担任执行委员会主席、工厂厂长、集体农庄主席和其他苏维埃和经济机关的领导人的最适合的人选，按理说应当是这些领导人的副手，而提升担任党的区委会、市委会、州委会第一书记职务的人选应当是第二书记。但是遗憾的是常常不是这样。在许多组织里，把党委会第二书记和各种机关的副职领导人提升到第一领导人职位的事情，是十分稀少的。发生这种现象主要是因为：当把工作人员提升担任苏维埃副主席、党机关的第二书记和把工作人员提升到其他领导机关的时候，常常是不考虑他们进一步提升的前景就选拔了一些工作人员，而有时甚至是为了单纯地安插一个人。人们说，就让他当执委会副主席吧。反正他已经上任了，也就没有什么可批准的了！（鼓掌、笑声）可是这种作法只能有害于工作。
    我也想谈一谈下面这件事。这种事在我们这里老早就出现并已经成为一个传统：我们在莫斯科、列宁格勒或国内其他大的中心区要为某些共和国和州培养各个部门的专业干部，而这些干部本来在当地就能很好地加以培养的。这样会引起什么结果呢？譬如说，我们在莫斯科训练这样的专家，为的是把他们送到远东去，那么为了“特殊的”工作条件，譬如气候条件等等就需要付给他们各种额外的津贴。一般说来，把这种人从莫斯科或列宁格勒派到伯力或雅库季亚去，到底是会有困难的。他们比较喜欢这里。就地培养、训练那些熟悉当地条件并用不着去适应环境和地方气候的干部，不是更好吗。无疑地，这对于工作是会有更大的益处的。全体干部必须付出巨大的创造性劳动不落后于生活的一日千里的发展速度
    党所规划的宏伟的七年计划，要求我们全体干部付出巨大的创造性劳动。同志们，我们有的是工作可做！我们的力量和组织才能是可以尽量施展和发挥的！
    我们已经开始了一桩伟大的历史事业——同资本主义的美国进行和平竞赛。我们应该在各方面都赶上并超过它。而我们无论如何都要做到这一点！（鼓掌）
    在我们面前需要完成的是这样复杂的任务，需要做的是这样多的事情，这就要求每个工作人员，不管他的职位是什么，都必须拿出最大的精力，发挥最大的主动性和组织才能，以便能光荣地担负起交付给他的工作，而不落后于生活，不落后于生活的一日千里的发展速度，并能达到新的更大的要求和任务的水平。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫：阿列克赛·伊拉里奥诺维奇，我可以对您的发言作一点补充吗？我想，这个补充不会打乱您在发言中所提出的正确方向的。
    您正确地谈到了远东，谈到有关把干部派到那里去的一些问题，谈到在艰苦的条件下工作的一些所谓“津贴”。
    让我们取消对远东以及对其他距离虽远但对我们所有的人来说却是最亲近的地方的分别对待情况吧，取消这种情况难道不已经是时候了吗？因此，把对基本工资所附加的一些“津贴”也连根拔掉不也是理所当然的吗？（经久不息的掌声）
    会场声音：对。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫：同志们！远东这个地区就自然条件说，是我们国家的珍珠。但是从前，它距离我们确实是太远了。骑马到那里去几乎要走半年，坐火车去也得两个星期。不过现在我们从莫斯科坐飞机到那里只需要六到八个小时，在这里吃过早饭，然后在远东就能吃午饭。这难道还远吗？它已经不“远”，而是近在咫尺了。（全场活跃，鼓掌）至于说到气候条件，那么那里一些地区可以生长葡萄。就以库页岛来说，这简直是一个引人入胜的地方！再说西伯利亚的一些城市，或者是雅库季亚，又何尝不是如此！在这些地方，到处沸腾着生气勃勃的、勤劳的、美好的生活。
    可是“津贴”产生了什么情况呢？如果一个雅库季亚人是当地出生，那么他得到的是一种工资。如果他是从我国中央地区来的雅库季亚人，那么同样的工作却得到另一种报酬。因此一些雅库季亚同志并非平白无故地向我开玩笑地建议说：让我们现在这样来安排吧，只要一个雅库季亚人生下来，那么就立刻多给他一些工资，因为他是在雅库季亚出生的。（会场笑声，掌声）
    如果保持这种津贴，那么我们就等于是对苏联的一些良好的、最富庶的地区实行歧视。这些地区有良好的气候。甚至常常还有病人到那里，譬如说，到叶尼塞河去进行疗养。
    同志们，请原谅我的这段补充。但是我的这种想法早已酝酿成熟了，因此这次我就利用基里钦科同志讲话的机会把它讲了出来。（会场活跃，暴风雨般的掌声）。
    阿·伊·基里钦科：尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇，你并没有打搅我，恰恰相反，我感谢您，并完全同意这一补充。这个补充使我的讲话丰富了。（会场活跃）
    共产主义思想已在全世界占着统治地位
    资本主义脓疮恶症和衰老面貌无法掩饰
    同志们！苏联各族人民获得的胜利和我们在七年计划中所要完成的工作，便是无往不胜的共产主义思想的伟大体现。正像报告中所清楚指出的，在我们的时代，共产主义思想已在全世界成为占统治地位的思想。对共产主义思想来说，不存在什么界线和边境的阻挡，它们用自己生气勃勃的力量和真理打动了人们的心。
    社会主义制度对资本主义的无比优越性，日益使资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国的劳动人民革命化。资产阶级的理论家以及和他们一脉相承的右翼社会党人看到这一点，便替他们的主子的命运担心起来，于是竭力掩盖资本主义的脓疮和恶症，为它衰老的面貌涂脂抹粉，用新衣服把它打扮起来。近来出现了许多各式各样的“理论”和“改善”资本主义使其变成“昌盛制度”的方案。资产阶级的理论家和右翼社会党人力图欺骗劳动人民，鼓吹进化的思想，宣传现代资本主义可变为某种形式的社会主义。他们大谈“资本主义的转化”和资本主义的更新。
    例如，右翼社会党人的思想家之一保罗·拉马第硬说，在目前的资本主义社会中，“国家的监督，全国规模的计划，甚至工人的监督越来越扩大。”这种保罗·拉马第所称呼的企业主式的资本主义，除去起源以外，同私人资本已无任何联系了。保罗·拉马第对现代资本主义的颂歌是以下列这一问题结束的，他说，“我们是否实际上已经开始建立新式的社会主义，而自己尚未意识到？”。同时他又扬言：“我们应当重新定出和宣布我们的思想的时机已经来到。”
    但是，无论他们如何专心致力，他们也不会孵出任何新的思想。因为正如俗语所说，“母鸡是孵不出老鹰来的”。无论资产阶级的思想家“定出”和“宣布”什么思想，他们都不能挽救资本主义。资本主义已经过时了，它在精神上和道义上都已枯竭，无论如何是无法进步的了。
    共产主义的精力磅礴，它一节一节地摧毁资本主义统治的锁链，唤起各国人民走向新生活，为他们开辟出未来的光辉前景。
    就在四十年前，还只有俄国工人阶级有自己的马克思列宁主义的共产主义工人政党、由弗·伊·列宁所培育和领导的这四十万俄国革命者——布尔什维克，领导了俄国劳动者向旧世界的冲击。当时其他国家的共产党，在伟大的十月革命影响下刚刚开始走上历史舞台。在伟大的十月革命后的最初几年，资本主义国家共产党数目只有二十个多一点，党员还不到五十万人。
    现今国际共产主义运动和工人运动已成长为真正使资本主义感到畏惧的强大力量。正如报告所指出的，现在全世界马克思列宁主义的共产党和工人党拥有三千三百万最英勇、正直、富有自我牺牲精神和忠于共产主义事业的劳动人民的儿女。马克思列宁主义的共产党和工人党，是进步人类的良心，是伟大未来的预告者和新世界的建设者。
    青年共产主义力量与年俱增。不过三四十年以前世界共产主义青年组织还只拥有几十万人，现在在共产主义的旗帜下团结在这些组织里的革命青年达六千万人以上。帝国主义的殖民体系已濒于土崩瓦解被压迫人民将彻底铲除殖民主义残余
    共产主义思想体现在保卫和平的斗争和蓬勃发展的被压迫人民的民族解放运动之中。当年弗·伊·列宁曾经预言：“全世界历史的明天将是这样的一天，就是觉醒了的被帝国主义压迫的人民彻底醒悟，并开始为求得自身的解放进行坚决的、长期的艰巨战斗。”（列宁全集俄文本三十六卷第五百五十九页）
    同志们，现在我们可以说，这一天已经到来了。帝国主义殖民体系在共产主义思想的影响下，在亚非和拉丁美洲国家被压迫人民民族解放运动的巨大冲击下，已经摇摇欲坠，濒于土崩瓦解。
    第二次世界大战后社会主义力量的蓬勃发展和巩固、伟大的中国人民革命的胜利，以及由欧亚十二个国家组成的世界社会主义阵营，决定了民族解放运动的加强，并加速了殖民体系崩溃的过程，缩小了帝国主义的势力范围。
    事实上，总共不过二十五到三十年以前，帝国主义殖民体系几乎囊括东亚和东南亚的一切国家。中近东和拉丁美洲国家在政治和经济上完全从属于最大的帝国主义国家。在帝国主义者看来，他们在非洲大陆上的统治是绝对牢不可破的。
    现在，看一看世界地图，就可以看出，地图上的颜色已经变得难以辨认了。标志帝国主义国家统治殖民地人民的那种单调色彩越来越少了。目前，处于帝国主义压迫下的殖民地、半殖民地和没有取得自治的国家的领土面积为二千五百五十万平方公里，即比第二次世界大战以前少了二分之一；而遭受殖民主义压迫的人口在同一时期内几乎减少了十分之九。
    殖民主义的时代已经过去了。殖民地被压迫人民在全人类进步力量支持下彻底铲除地球上的殖民主义残余的日子，已经为期不远了。（经久不息的掌声）
    同志们，大家知道，美国和其他资本主义国家的帝国主义集团对共产主义思想害怕得要死。他们不停地胡说，共产主义威胁来自苏联。但是，每个人都知道，共产主义像其他一切思想一样是不能输出的。各国人民自己会选择他们的发展道路和他们愿意生活的那种社会制度。而这些大人先生们害怕共产主义，也就是说，他们害怕本国的人民，不信任他们。
    帝国主义分子疯狂地企图堵塞共产主义思想的道路，阻止各国人民胜利的解放斗争，这倒极像著名作家弗·柯罗连科所写的童话“太阳，站住，月亮，不许动！”中一个人物的行动。童话是这样的：在某个国家里有一个姓乌斯塔列夫希（意为“过了时的”——译者注）的将军。占星家预告这位将军，随着春天的到来他的统治就要告终。这样，为了挽救自己的统治，自己的权势，将军决定阻挡住春天的来临。他做的第一件事，是消灭其管区内的所有日历，以便使人们不知道春天何时降临。他命令向春天的报信者——燕子开炮。他在管区疆界上加强了守卫，以便拦住春泛……（全场活跃）。但是，尽管这位将军作了一切努力，设法防止春天到来，但是春天还是来临了。
    同志们！共产主义是人类的春天。无论帝国主义者——这些现代的将军们、过了时的大人先生们怎样大发雷霆，怎样妄图阻止历史发展的进程，而共产主义的思想，犹如春泛一样流遍世界各国和所有大陆，掌握着群众，使劳动人民挺身与资本主义进行斗争。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
    同志们！毫无疑问，第二十一次代表大会将一致地通过在我国全面展开共产主义建设的宏伟纲领。
    拥有极其丰富的社会主义建设经验、在久经斗争考验和锻炼的强大的共产党领导下的千百万苏联人民，进入了具有历史意义的七年。由马克思列宁主义武装起来的共产党清楚地看到通向伟大目标的道路。苏联人民之所以有不可战胜的力量，也正是因为：领导他们前进的是坚定不移的共产主义旗手——伟大的列宁的党。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）。
