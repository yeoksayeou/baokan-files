Tass, Moscow, February 6th - The resolution of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the report by Comrade N. S. Khrushchev on the control figures for the development of the national economy of the USSR for 1959-1965.

(Adopted unanimously on February 5, 1959)

The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was convened at a crucial historical juncture, when the Soviet state, after implementing extensive reforms in all spheres of social life, had entered a new phase of development—full-scale construction of a communist society—on the basis of the victory of socialism. Many generations have struggled to achieve the great goal of building communism, and now this goal is being realized by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party.

The program for the construction of communism in the USSR, which ensures a new, enormous upsurge in the economy, culture, and material well-being of the people, is unprecedented in its scale. The seven-year plan for the development of the national economy of the USSR is the embodiment of the general line of the Party in the current stage.

The Congress expresses deep satisfaction with the process and results of the discussion of the draft of the report by Comrade N. S. Khrushchev on the control figures for the development of the national economy of the USSR for 1959-1965, which took place before the Congress. This discussion vividly demonstrated the creative initiative and activity of the Soviet people and their close unity around their tried and tested leader—the Communist Party. The entire Soviet people unanimously approved the control figures for the development of the national economy, considering the seven-year plan as their own vital cause, and expressed their determination to fulfill and overfulfill the plan's tasks.

The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union resolves:

1. To approve the draft and the report by Comrade N. S. Khrushchev on the control figures for the development of the national economy of the USSR for 1959-1965;
2. To approve the control figures for the development of the national economy of the USSR for 1959-1965, as well as the amendments and additions proposed on the basis of the discussion of the draft before and during the Congress;
3. To recommend that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR, in accordance with the development of the national economy of the USSR, make the necessary corrections to the annual plans for the development of the national economy of the USSR, drawn up on the basis of the control figures approved by the Congress.

I.

The period since the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has been one of the most important in the history of the Party and the Soviet state. As a result of the implementation of the decisions of the Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and subsequent plenums of the Central Committee, the Soviet people have achieved outstanding successes in advancing towards communism. This period has shown that the decisions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are of great importance not only for the construction of communism in the USSR but also for the entire international communist and workers' movement and for the consolidation of world peace.

The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union fully approves the activities of the Central Committee and the major measures it has taken in domestic and foreign policy. The important decisions of the Party, namely, on the reorganization of the management of industry and construction, on the accelerated development of the chemical industry, on the reorganization of the Machine-Tractor Stations and the further development of the kolkhoz system, on the increase in agricultural production, on strengthening the connection of schools with life and the further development of the national education system, have great significance for the improvement of the economy, the development of culture, the improvement of the well-being of the working people, and the construction of communism.

Due to the Leninist line of the Central Committee and the selfless labor of the Soviet people, the might of the Soviet state has increased, and its international authority has grown.

The basis of the entire activity of the Central Committee is the creative application of Marxist-Leninist theory to the tasks of communist construction, a deep study of the experience of the masses, constant contact with the life of the people, the ability to find decisive links in the chain of historical development, the ability to show perspectives and mobilize the masses, as well as the ability to boldly and decisively destroy all obsolete things that hinder progress.

The Congress unanimously approves the resolutions of the June (1957) Plenum of the Central Committee, which was supported by the entire Party and the entire people. This plenum exposed and ideologically crushed the anti-party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov. This group used the most vile factional struggle methods to try to disrupt the unity of the Party, to lead the Party and the state away from the Leninist path. It opposed all major measures taken to implement the decisions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, opposed those measures that brought us great successes in the development of industry and agriculture, in improving the material well-being of the people, in achieving the easing of international tensions and the consolidation of the cause of peace in foreign policy. The Central Committee acted correctly in decisively condemning and expelling the shameful factionalists and splitters. After exposing and ideologically crushing the anti-party group, the Party, under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, became even more closely united around the Central Committee.

The Communist Party, being faithful to Marxism-Leninism, united, and closely connected with the people, has always been invincible. The Soviet people consider Lenin's Party to be their tried and tested leader and teacher, and they see its wise leadership as a guarantee of new achievements in the cause of communism.

The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with great satisfaction and revolutionary pride, sums up the great victories of the Soviet people. The main result of the heroic struggle and labor of the Soviet people is the new society they have built—socialism—and the political system corresponding to it—the Soviet socialist state.

Our country has become a powerful socialist state with a highly developed economy and advanced science and culture. Now, the industrial output of the USSR ranks first in Europe and second in the world. The total industrial output in 1958 was thirty-five times greater than in 1913, with the production of means of production—the basis of the entire national economy—increasing eighty-two times, and the production of machine-building and metalworking industries increasing to two hundred forty times. In 1958, the production of steel in our country was approximately fifty-five million tons, oil—one billion one hundred thirty million tons, coal—four billion nine hundred sixty million tons, and electricity—two hundred thirty-three billion kilowatt-hours.

Great achievements have also been made in the development of light and food industries. The production of consumer goods in 1958 was almost thirteen times greater than in 1913, with the production of cultural and household goods increasing forty-four times. Currently, the production of consumer goods is one and a half times greater than in 1940.

The enormous scale and unprecedented high rate of development of industrial production are due to the advantages of the socialist economic system, the use of the latest scientific and technological achievements, and the development of all-people socialist competition. On this basis, the labor productivity in all branches of the national economy is constantly increasing. In 1958, under the conditions of a shortened working day, the labor productivity in industry was nine times higher than in 1913 and one and a half times higher than in 1940.

Along with the rapid development of socialist industry, agriculture has also developed successfully. The Party courageously and severely criticized the errors and shortcomings in the leadership of agriculture in the past, removed all obstacles to the development of production in kolkhozes and state farms, and drafted a program for the rapid development of agriculture. The measures for the further development of agriculture, adopted and implemented by the Party and the Soviet people, have brought abundant results to our Motherland. In 1958, thirty-five billion poods of grain were procured, which is sixteen billion poods more than in 1953. Due to the cultivation of tens of millions of hectares of new land, the state has received tens of billions of poods of grain. In the last five years compared to the previous five years, the average annual production of grain increased by 39%. The production of other crops, especially sugar beets and cotton, as well as the development of state livestock farming, has also achieved great success.

The Soviet state has a powerful, fully developed industry and a highly mechanized agriculture. On the basis of the general upsurge of the socialist economy, the wealth of the state is constantly increasing, and the material well-being and culture of the people are constantly improving. In the years of Soviet power, the national income per capita has increased fourteen times. In 1958, the real income of workers and employees was almost double that of 1940, while the real income of peasants, calculated per working person, increased by more than one and a half times.

To implement the decisions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the following major measures were taken: increasing the wages of low-paid workers and employees, shortening the working days before holidays and vacations, transitioning many workers and employees in heavy industry to a shorter working day, establishing a six-hour and four-hour working day for juvenile workers, improving the conditions of social insurance benefits for workers, extending the period of leave before and after childbirth, and significantly increasing the benefits for workers and employees. The Soviet state allocates more and more funds to meet the material and cultural needs of the working people.

The Communist Party has raised millions of new people—conscious builders of communism. This is the most brilliant achievement of the socialist system.

In the Soviet state, the culture of all nationalities and peoples has reached true prosperity, providing unlimited opportunities for the full and free development of science, technology, literature, and art. The successful launch of the first artificial Earth satellites and the first artificial planet orbiting the Sun is a vivid manifestation of the high level of industrial technology and the creative genius of the Soviet people. With its great victories in the field of scientific and technological thought, the Soviet state has opened a new era of knowledge of the world. The great significance of these victories lies in the fact that they demonstrate the powerful creative force of socialism serving the interests of humanity, the progress and prosperity of mankind. The Soviet people, seeing their Motherland at the forefront of world scientific and technological progress and courageously blazing the trail to the future, are filled with patriotic pride.

The historical victories of the Soviet people in the economic and cultural spheres, the measures taken by the Party and the government in recent years, have further consolidated the Soviet system and its unshakable foundation—the alliance of workers and peasants. The friendship of the Soviet peoples has become even stronger, and their political unity has been further consolidated. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics sets an example for the world, being a communist family of free and equal nations.

The USSR, which has opened the way to socialism for humanity, has reached such a level in the development of productive forces, socialist production relations, and culture that it can, in the next seven years, launch the construction of a communist society on a broad front.

II.

The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union considers the main tasks of the Party in the coming seven years to be:

In the economic sphere: to comprehensively develop the productive forces of the state, on the basis of priority development of heavy industry, to ensure such growth in the production of all economic sectors as to take a decisive step in creating the material and technical base for the construction of communism and to ensure victory in the peaceful economic competition with capitalist countries. The strengthening of the economic power of the state, the further technical development of all sectors of the national economy, and the constant increase in social labor productivity will ensure a significant improvement in the living standards of the people;

In the political sphere: to further consolidate the Soviet socialist system, to further strengthen the unity and solidarity of the Soviet people, to develop Soviet democracy and the activity and initiative of the broad masses of the people in the construction of a communist society, to expand the functions of various social organizations in solving state problems, to enhance the organizational and educational role of the Party and the socialist state, to strengthen the alliance of workers and peasants and the friendship of the peoples of the USSR;

In the ideological sphere: to strengthen the ideological and educational work of the Party, to raise the communist consciousness of workers, especially the younger generation, to educate them in the spirit of communist labor attitudes, Soviet patriotism, and internationalism, to overcome the remnants of capitalist consciousness in people, and to struggle against the bourgeois ideology;

In the sphere of international relations: to consistently pursue a foreign policy of maintaining and strengthening peace and the security of peoples, based on Lenin's principles of peaceful coexistence of states with different social systems; to implement the policy of stopping the "cold war" and easing international tensions; to strengthen the world socialist system and the family of fraternal peoples.

The fundamental issue for the coming seven years is to gain as much time as possible in the peaceful economic competition between socialism and capitalism. It is necessary to ensure high rates of development and the necessary proportions in the national economy.

The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union considers the development of industry, especially heavy industry, to be of paramount importance and believes that in the seven-year plan it is necessary to provide for an increase in the total industrial output by approximately 80%, with the first category (production of means of production) increasing by 85-88%, and the second category (production of consumer goods) by 62-65%. It is necessary to provide for an average annual increase in the total industrial output by approximately 8.6%, in the first category by 9.3%, and in the second category by 7.3%.

The Congress considers it necessary to provide in the seven-year plan for:

A significant increase in the production of ferrous and non-ferrous metals to better meet the needs of the national economy. By 1965, the production of pig iron should reach 65-70 million tons, steel—86-91 million tons, rolled metal—65-70 million tons, commercial iron ore—150-160 million tons; the production of aluminum should increase by 1.8-2 times, copper—by 90%, and the production of other non-ferrous metals, especially rare metals, should also increase significantly;

Accelerated development of the chemical industry, especially the production of synthetic fibers, plastics, and other synthetic materials, as well as mineral fertilizers. By the end of the seven-year period, the production of synthetic fibers should increase three times, plastics and synthetic resins—by more than six times, and mineral fertilizers—by approximately two times;

Changing the structure of fuel balance, with priority given to the extraction and production of the most economical fuels—oil and gas. It is necessary to ensure that by 1965, the extraction of oil reaches 230-240 million tons, and the extraction and production of gas—1,500 billion cubic meters, and the extraction of coal—6-6,120 million tons;

Rapid development of the electrification of all sectors of the national economy, mainly through the construction of large thermal power stations. By 1965, the annual production of electricity should increase to 500-520 billion kilowatt-hours;

High-speed development of machine-building and instrument-making industries to equip enterprises with new, highly productive equipment, machines, and instruments, to achieve the full mechanization and automation of production. In seven years, it is necessary to increase the production of machine-building and metalworking products by approximately one and a half times.

The Congress believes that it is necessary, on the basis of the high level of development of heavy industry and the further development of agriculture, to provide for a significant increase in the production of consumer goods, thereby ensuring the full satisfaction of the population's demand for textiles, clothing, footwear, and other goods in seven years.

To achieve this task, by 1965 compared to 1958:

The total output of light industry should increase by approximately 50%, with the production of cotton fabrics increasing by 33-38%, wool fabrics—by 65%, silk fabrics—by 76%, and footwear—by 45%.

The total output of the food industry should increase by approximately 70%, with the production of meat increasing by approximately 110%, animal fats—by 58%, dairy products—by 120%, sugar—by 76-90%, and fish—by 60%.

Special attention should be paid to increasing the variety of industrial goods and food, improving their quality, and increasing the production of household goods.

All Party organizations must ensure the rhythmic production of enterprises so that the state plan's output and quality indicators are fulfilled and overfulfilled daily and monthly. It is necessary to more fully utilize the internal potential and possibilities of enterprises to increase production under the existing production capacities, to constantly improve technological processes and the organization of production, to improve the use of equipment, raw materials, and materials.

The basic task in agriculture is to develop production to the level where it can fully meet the population's demand for food and the industry's demand for raw materials, and to ensure the state's needs for all other agricultural products. The main way to solve this task is to significantly increase the yield of all crops per unit area, to increase the number of livestock, and to further increase the productivity of public livestock farming.

In seven years, the total output of agriculture will increase by 70%, and the production of some of the most important products should reach the following levels: grain—100-110 billion poods, sugar beets—76-84 million tons, raw cotton—570-610 million poods, meat (by slaughter weight)—16 million tons, milk—1-1.05 billion tons, potatoes—1.47 billion tons, and the quantity of vegetables should be sufficient to meet the needs of the population.

The main direction in agriculture in the coming years will remain the full-scale increase in the production of grain, which is the basis of the entire agricultural production. Now, kolkhozes and state farms have all the conditions to increase the average yield of grain per hectare by three to four poods in the coming years. In livestock farming, the basic task is to increase the production of meat, milk, wool, and eggs. To achieve this, it is necessary to increase the number of livestock and improve the productivity of various types of livestock, to develop poultry and rabbit farming in kolkhoz and state farm pastures, and to consistently strengthen the fodder base of livestock farming, primarily by increasing the production of corn, potatoes, sugar beets, and protein feed such as clover, alfalfa, vetch-oat mixtures, peas, and broad beans, as well as other similar types. It is necessary to increase the production of soybeans.

The timely and overfulfillment of the annual plans for the procurement of various agricultural products is an important task.

The Congress expresses confidence that, due to the nationwide movement to fulfill ahead of schedule the tasks set by the control figures in the production of agricultural products, especially in the production of meat and other livestock products, it will be possible not only to fulfill but also to overfulfill the seven-year plan in terms of time and quantity. The republics, territories, and regions have already developed specific measures for the expansion of agricultural production in the coming years and have guaranteed that in 1959, the production of meat will increase by one to two times or more. This initiative should be fully supported. The republics, territories, regions, districts, kolkhozes, and state farms, by fulfilling their guarantees, will be able to make a valuable contribution to the implementation of the advanced initiative of kolkhozes and state farms—to catch up with the USA in the production of meat and other agricultural products per capita in a short period. In this regard, the contribution of each republic, territory, region, district, kolkhoz, and state farm should be calculated based on the production of livestock products per 100 hectares of land.

To successfully solve the enormous tasks facing agriculture in the coming seven years, the Party, Soviets, and agricultural organizations must make every effort to strengthen the public economy of kolkhozes, take major measures to further mechanize, electrify, and improve the organization of labor in agriculture, and on this basis, ensure a significant increase in labor productivity and a reduction in the cost of agricultural products. As the leading socialist enterprises in agriculture, state farms should play a greater role.

In parallel with the implementation of measures to further expand agricultural production, it is necessary to use the forces of kolkhozes, state farms, and consumer cooperatives to develop the construction of agricultural processing enterprises, to expand the construction of housing and cultural and welfare facilities in rural areas, and to develop the construction of public utilities in rural areas. Due to the increase in the income of kolkhozes, it is necessary to more widely adopt the method of joint construction by several kolkhozes to build power stations, lay roads, construct building materials enterprises, and large-scale, well-equipped kolkhoz joint canneries, bakeries, and other enterprises.

The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union considers that the development of all sectors of agricultural production will also be a major task for the Party, Soviets, agricultural organizations, and all workers of kolkhozes and state farms in the coming years.

To ensure the high rate of development of the national economy, it is necessary to develop various types of transport. In seven years, it is necessary to carry out a fundamental technical reform of several main types of transport, especially railways, by replacing steam locomotives with economically advantageous electric and diesel locomotives. It is also necessary to strive to increase sea, river, air, and road transport, to expand pipeline transport, and to use the most economically advantageous types of transport for different regions and goods. It is necessary to develop telephone communication, radio, and television networks.

The Congress considers that the widespread adoption of new technologies, the full mechanization and automation of production processes, the specialization and cooperation of all sectors of the national economy are decisive conditions for the successful implementation of the seven-year plan and the creation of the material and technical base for communism. The task for the seven years is to eliminate heavy manual labor on the basis of the full mechanization of production processes in industry, agriculture, construction, and transport.

Given that the measures to implement the full mechanization and broader automation of production have not only economic but also great social significance, the Congress instructs the Central Committee of the Communist Party and local Party organizations to exercise constant supervision over all measures to implement the full mechanization and automation of production.

It is necessary, on the basis of the most effective use of natural resources and considering the appropriate specialization of enterprises, to improve the cooperation between enterprises and economic regions, and to eliminate irrational transport, to consistently implement the further comprehensive development of economic regions.

To achieve high rates of socialist expanded reproduction, the Congress considers it necessary to take major measures in the field of capital construction in the coming seven years. The volume of state investments will increase by 80% compared to the previous seven years, amounting to approximately 1,940-1,970 billion rubles, which is almost equal to the total volume of investments in the national economy during the entire period of Soviet power. To use the investments in capital construction as rationally as possible, it is necessary to allocate more funds for the reconstruction, expansion, and technical re-equipment of existing enterprises, to modernize equipment, which will make it possible to solve the tasks of increasing production and improving labor productivity more quickly and with less expenditure than the construction of new enterprises.

The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union notes that to timely complete the planned volume of capital construction, it is necessary to continue the policy of maximum industrialization of construction, turning the production of construction into a mechanized flow process of assembling buildings from large-sized parts and components manufactured in factories. It is necessary to accelerate the development of the construction materials industry, especially the cement industry, to expand the production of reinforced concrete structures, to more boldly merge construction organizations, to improve design work, to concentrate investments on the most important projects that have already started, to strive to shorten the construction period, to reduce costs, and to improve the quality of construction and installation work.

Given the unprecedented scale of construction in the coming seven years and the need to save as much social labor and time as possible, it is necessary to pay special attention to the correct placement of productive forces. It is necessary to pay attention to the further development of the economy of the eastern regions of our country, which are rich in natural resources. In solving the problem of the further growth of production capacities, it is necessary to give priority to those regions where investments can achieve the maximum economic effect. Party organizations must ensure the strictest protection of state interests and eliminate any manifestations of localism.

The USSR is a multinational socialist state based on the friendship of all equal nations. The peoples of the USSR, with a common will and desire, consistently move forward along the path of communist construction. Our plans vividly reflect Lenin's national policy, which ensures broad opportunities for the comprehensive development of the economy and culture of all peoples.

The seven-year plan provides for a significant development of the economy of each union republic. In each republic, it is first necessary to develop those economic sectors that have natural and economic conditions, in order to more effectively use the resources of each republic and to correctly combine the interests of each republic with the interests of the entire USSR.

The Congress considers that a significant increase in social labor productivity (the main source of expanded socialist reproduction and the basis for further improvement of the living standards of the people) is an extremely important task of the seven-year plan. During the seven years, the labor productivity in industry will increase by 45-50%, in construction—by 60-65%, in railway transport—by 34-37%, in state farms—by 60-65%, and in kolkhozes—by approximately one and a half times.

It is necessary to reduce production costs in order to reduce the cost of industrial production by at least 11.5% and the cost of construction and installation work by at least 6% in seven years.

All Party organizations, economic organizations, trade unions, and Komsomol organizations must wage a struggle to fulfill and overfulfill the tasks of the seven-year plan on increasing labor productivity and reducing production costs, to wage a struggle for economy. It is necessary to organize a nationwide movement against all manifestations of waste and carelessness towards public property. It is necessary to strengthen the responsibility of leaders for improving all quality indicators of enterprises and construction sites, especially for reducing the cost of production and improving the quality of products. It is necessary to strengthen economic accounting in industry, transport, and agriculture.

The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union considers that under the current conditions, given the significant achievements in the development of industry and agriculture, there are all the conditions to make the life of the Soviet people better in the near future, to more fully satisfy their material and spiritual needs. To this end, the seven-year plan provides for:

An increase in national income by 62-65%. This will ensure a significant increase in consumption, with the total consumption of the population increasing by 60-63% in seven years;

In seven years, the real income of workers, calculated per worker on average, will increase by 40%, and the real income of collective farmers will increase by at least 40%;

In the near future, the taxation of the population will be abolished;

Measures will be taken to adjust wages, and in seven years, the wages of low-paid workers will be increased from 270-350 rubles per month to 500-600 rubles;

The minimum pension will be increased, in cities from the current 300 rubles per month to 400 rubles, and for old people who have lived in rural areas for a long time and are connected with agriculture, from 255 rubles to 340 rubles; the minimum pensions for disabled persons and allowances for dependents will also be increased;

The work of commercial and public catering services for the population will be significantly improved, the network of public catering enterprises will be expanded, and the prices of products in public catering enterprises will be reduced;

The number of boarding schools, kindergartens, nurseries, and homes for the elderly will be increased;

Large-scale housing and public utilities construction will be carried out, and in the next seven years, approximately 650-660 million square meters of housing will be built in cities and workers' settlements, which is approximately 15 million apartments, and in rural areas, approximately 7 million houses will be built with the efforts of collective farmers and rural intelligentsia;

Measures will be implemented to shorten the working day and working week. In 1960, workers and employees will transition to a seven-hour working day, and in coal and mining industries, workers in the main underground operations will transition to a six-hour working day. In 1962, workers and employees working a seven-hour day will transition to a forty-hour working week. From 1964, workers engaged in underground work and in harmful working conditions will gradually transition to a thirty-hour working week, and all other workers will transition to a thirty-five-hour working week, i.e., a six to seven-hour working day with two rest days per week;

The turnover of retail trade in state and cooperative trade will increase by approximately 62%. The sale of livestock products, vegetable oils, sugar, fruits, citrus fruits, the most important industrial goods—fabrics, clothing, underwear, footwear, as well as cultural and household goods and miscellaneous goods will be significantly increased, especially those goods that lighten the daily labor of women.

The implementation of all these measures will be a new great achievement of the working people of our country, a vivid manifestation of the unceasing concern of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government for the well-being of the Soviet people.

The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union considers that the implementation of the grand plans for communist construction requires all levels of Party, Soviet, trade union, and Komsomol organizations to further improve the work of educating the Soviet people, to raise their consciousness and activity, to educate new people in the spirit of collectivism and diligence, in the spirit of social responsibility, in the spirit of socialist internationalism and patriotism, in the spirit of unceasing adherence to the high principles of communist morality.

The education of the working people in the spirit of communism, the overcoming of the remnants of capitalist consciousness in people, should be the center of attention and the main task of all levels of Party, Soviet, trade union, Komsomol, and other social organizations. It is necessary to continue the uncompromising struggle against hostile bourgeois ideology. In the ideological work of the Party, propaganda and agitation, the press, cinema, radio, and television, as well as cultural and educational institutions, should play an important role.

Special attention should be paid to the communist education of the growing generation. All levels of Party and Soviet organizations should ensure the consistent implementation of all measures for the reform of secondary and higher schools, to make Soviet schools achieve a close connection between education and production, with the practice of communist construction, and thus to raise citizens who are comprehensively educated and conscious, as well as middle and higher specialized personnel.

Title: The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union

The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) has emphasized the crucial role of science in the current phase of building communism. The Congress noted that Soviet science has achieved significant progress in all fields, particularly in nuclear physics, atomic energy, jet aircraft, and rocket technology. It stressed the need to accelerate the development of all scientific disciplines over the next seven years, focusing on important theoretical research to ensure further advancements in science and technology. A comprehensive plan should be formulated to concentrate scientific resources on the most significant practical and theoretical aspects. Continuous efforts should be made to strengthen the connection between scientific institutions and practical applications, rapidly applying the latest scientific and technological achievements to the national economy. Bold experimentation and design work should be encouraged.

In the social sciences, particularly economics, the task is to creatively summarize the experiences of economic and cultural construction and study the new issues arising from life. It is essential to deeply investigate the laws governing the transition to communism, conduct a comprehensive analysis of crucial processes in the capitalist world, expose the bourgeois ideological system, and fight for the purity of Marxist-Leninist theory.

Over the next seven years, socialist culture should continue to develop. Artists in literature, drama, film, music, sculpture, and painting should strive to elevate the ideological and artistic standards of their works. They will continue to be active assistants of the Party and the state in educating the working people in communism, promoting communist morality, and developing a multi-ethnic socialist culture.

The 21st Congress of the CPSU, in defining the tasks for the current phase of communist construction, starts from the premise that the Soviet Union has entered a new historical period. Socialism has achieved complete and thorough victory in our country. The era when the Soviet Union was the sole socialist state surrounded by hostile capitalist powers has passed. Now, there are two world systems: the outdated capitalism and the vibrant socialism. The working people of all countries sympathize with socialism. No force in the world can restore capitalism in our country or defeat the socialist camp.

Under the leadership of the Party, the Soviet people have achieved tremendous victories in all spheres of economic and socio-political life, making it possible to genuinely implement the task of creating the material and technical foundations for a communist society and making a planned transition to communism. Only by surpassing the production levels of advanced capitalist countries and ensuring higher labor productivity under socialism than under capitalism can communism be realized.

The comprehensive development of communist construction must ensure an abundance of material wealth, a rich spiritual culture, and the gradual satisfaction of the needs of all people, as well as the further development of socialist democracy and the cultivation of conscious builders of a communist society.

With the growth of productive forces, socialist social relations based on comradely cooperation, friendship, and mutual aid should be increasingly perfected. As technological progress advances in various economic sectors and education becomes more closely integrated with production, the fundamental differences between mental and physical labor will gradually disappear, and the cultural and technical level of all working people will gradually rise. The mechanization and automation of production as a whole, along with the reduction of the working day and the improvement of working conditions, will make labor a necessity for the comprehensive development of man.

In recent years, measures have been implemented to boost agriculture and the public economy of collective farms, making the collective farm system increasingly stable and revealing its advantages and immense potential. All this indicates that the collective farm-cooperative form of production relations is serving the development of agricultural productive forces and will continue to do so for a long time to come.

In the process of communist construction, the level of public ownership in collective farm production will be raised, and the collective farm-cooperative ownership will approach state ownership, gradually eliminating the boundaries between them. The public funds of collective farms will continue to increase and expand, and the production ties between collective farms will develop more extensively. The fusion of the collective farm-cooperative form of ownership and the state form will not occur through the contraction of collective farm-cooperative ownership but through raising its level of public ownership to state ownership with the help and support of the socialist state.

Under the current conditions of communist construction, the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" remains the guiding principle for the distribution of material wealth. Distribution according to work ensures that people are materially interested in the results of production, stimulates the growth of labor productivity, improves the professional level of workers, and improves production technology. Distribution according to work also has a significant educational role, helping people to accustom themselves to socialist discipline and making labor a universal and necessary activity. Equalitarian distribution would squander the accumulated funds and harm the construction of communism.

As socialist society develops and the consciousness of the masses rises, the labor enthusiasm of Soviet people will continue to grow, their concern for social welfare will increase, and the desire to get rich will gradually disappear. The spiritual motivation to work for the benefit of society will become increasingly significant.

The transition to distribution according to needs will gradually be realized with the development of productive forces, when all necessary consumer goods are abundant, and all people can voluntarily and to the best of their abilities work for the society, recognizing it as a social necessity.

In the Soviet society, a significant and growing part of material and cultural wealth is already distributed free of charge in the form of pensions, student scholarships, allowances for mothers with many children, and the construction and maintenance of schools, hospitals, kindergartens, boarding schools, clubs, libraries, and other cultural institutions. This part of the social consumption fund will continue to grow, serving as an important prerequisite for the gradual transition to the communist principle of distribution.

The Congress pointed out that under current conditions, the main direction in the development of the socialist state is to strive for the development of democracy, attracting all citizens to participate in the leadership of economic and cultural construction and the management of social affairs. The role of the Soviets, as organizations of the working people, must be enhanced. Many functions currently performed by state agencies should gradually be transferred to social organizations. Issues such as cultural services, healthcare, and sports for residents should be resolved with the active and broad participation of social organizations. In maintaining the norms of socialist public life, people's vigilante squads, comrade courts, and similar social institutions will play an increasingly important role, cooperating with state institutions to perform the functions of maintaining social order and citizens' rights and preventing harmful behavior to society.

Transferring certain functions of state agencies to social organizations will not weaken the role of the socialist state in communist construction but will expand and strengthen the political foundations of socialist society, ensuring the further development of socialist democracy. The Soviet state will be able to concentrate more effort on developing the economy, which is the material foundation of our system.

The task of the socialist state in defending peace and repelling military threats from imperialist countries is particularly important. As long as the imperialist camp of aggression and military blocs exists, the Soviet state must strengthen and enhance its glorious armed forces—land and naval forces—to defend the socialist achievements and peaceful labor of the Soviet people. It is necessary to strengthen the state security organs, whose primary target is the spies sent by imperialist countries. The functions of defending the socialist homeland currently performed by the state will only disappear when the danger of imperialist aggression is completely eliminated.

The Congress firmly believes that the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan will further strengthen the Soviet Union and the world socialist camp as a powerful bastion of peace and progress, further enhancing the forces of peace and weakening the forces of war. The achievements of the Seven-Year Plan will be a great victory for the invincible Marxist-Leninist doctrine and a testament to the superiority of socialism over capitalism. These achievements will attract millions of new believers to the side of socialism.

The Seven-Year Plan opens a new stage in the economic competition between socialism and capitalism. The great labor of the Soviet people, advancing along the Leninist path, has elevated our country to such heights that it can now compete economically with the United States and win this competition, leaving this major capitalist country behind. In this regard, the high rate of growth of our production will be decisive.

By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will surpass the most developed capitalist countries in Europe, such as Britain and West Germany, in terms of industrial output per capita, taking the first place in Europe. In several key products, the absolute production volume will surpass the current industrial production level of the United States, and in other products, it will approach the current industrial production level of the United States. At that time, the total production and per capita production of major agricultural products will also exceed the current level of the United States. To surpass and exceed the United States in terms of industrial output per capita, it may take another five years after the completion of the Seven-Year Plan. Therefore, by that time, or possibly even earlier, the Soviet Union will take the first place in the world in terms of absolute industrial output and industrial output per capita. This will be a victory of world-historical significance for socialism in its peaceful competition with capitalism.

The characteristics of the development of capitalist countries are quite different. The general crisis of capitalism is deepening due to the growth of socialist forces, the collapse of the colonial system, and the sharpening of internal social contradictions. The instability of the capitalist economy is intensifying, experiencing one crisis after another in production decline. Neither the arms race nor other measures taken by capitalist countries can eliminate the causes of the crisis. The contradictions of capitalism continue to increase, breeding new instability.

On the world stage, the world socialist system is competing economically with the world capitalist system. The economies of the countries in the socialist camp are developing at a rapid pace. The high rate of production development is now confirmed by the experience of socialist countries as a universal law of socialism. As a result of socialist industrialization and the cooperative path of peasants, some people's democratic countries have entered the period of completing the establishment of socialism.

According to economists' calculations, after the completion and overfulfillment of the Seven-Year Plan and the high-speed development of the economies of people's democratic countries, the industrial output of the world socialist system will account for more than half of the world's total industrial output. Thus, in the decisive sphere of human activity—material production—it will ensure the superiority of the world socialist system over the world capitalist system.

The characteristic of the development of the economies of socialist countries is that as they advance, their mutual relations are also strengthened, and the unity of the world socialist system is further enhanced. The development trend in the capitalist world is the opposite; there, the growth of production in one country or another will deepen the contradictions between capitalist countries, intensify competition, and lead to mutual conflicts.

With the further strengthening and expansion of the world socialist system, all socialist countries will develop more successfully. Formerly economically backward countries, relying on the experience of other socialist countries and cooperation and mutual assistance, are rapidly catching up in their economies and cultures. Thus, the common level of economic and cultural development of all socialist countries will be balanced and will create the prerequisites for the transition from the first stage of communism to the second stage at an increasingly rapid pace. The time for these countries, like the Soviet Union, to build a communist society is approaching.

The Soviet Union considers it an important task to continue promoting the strengthening of unity among socialist countries, developing close economic and cultural ties between them, and strengthening the friendly family of free peoples on the basis of the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism.

The Congress believes that the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan, as well as the implementation of the economic plans of other socialist countries, will create more favorable conditions for solving the current fundamental problem—maintaining world peace. The conclusion of the 20th Congress of the Party that war is not an inevitable fate has been completely proven correct. Now, there are enormous forces in the world that can defend peace and inflict a crushing defeat on the aggressors if imperialist aggressors start a war. The aggression of imperialist countries against the socialist camp can only have one outcome—the demise of capitalism.

The new achievements of the socialist camp countries will certainly strengthen and develop the peace-loving forces of the world. More and more countries will unite with countries advocating the strengthening of peace. The idea of not allowing war will become more firmly rooted in the minds of the peoples of all countries. Then, the peace-loving peoples of all countries will be able to rely on the strength of the socialist camp to force the imperialist warlike cliques to abandon their plans for a new war. Thus, even before socialism has completely triumphed on Earth and while capitalism still exists in some parts of the world, there will be a real possibility of eliminating world war from human social life.

However, the danger of war launched by imperialism still exists and cannot be underestimated. Therefore, socialist countries and all peace-loving forces must remain highly vigilant and strive more to defend peace.

The aggressive policy of American imperialism remains the main source of the danger of war, reflecting the ambitions of American monopoly capital to dominate the world. The ruling classes of the United States, as well as West Germany, Britain, France, and other countries participating in the North Atlantic aggression bloc, continue to stockpile atomic weapons, reject peaceful solutions to international problems, and constantly provoke military conflicts in various parts of the world. At the same time, West Germany is playing the role of the main striking force of the North Atlantic Alliance and is currently becoming the main base for atomic weapons and rockets of this alliance. Militarism and revanchism have risen in West Germany, threatening the peace-loving peoples of all countries.

Recent experience shows that the imperialist threat of aggression is directed at the peoples of various regions of the world. Imperialists are inciting military conflicts in the Near East, the Middle East, and the Pacific region, taking military action against the African nations struggling for freedom, and constantly threatening to interfere militarily in the internal affairs of Latin American countries.

Under these circumstances, it is particularly urgent for the peace-loving peoples of all countries to fight for the establishment of collective security and for the resolution of international disputes without resorting to war.

The aggressive policies of Western countries are in direct opposition to the Leninist peaceful foreign policy pursued by the Soviet Union and all socialist countries, which is supported by the peace-loving peoples of all countries. In recent years, due to the firm positions taken by the socialist camp countries and the peace-loving countries of the East, the fires of war in the Middle East and the Far East have been extinguished just as they began to flare up, and other plots of the imperialists have been thwarted.

The 21st Congress of the CPSU unanimously approved the Leninist peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet government, which is an insurmountable obstacle on the path of imperialist aggression. Recently, the Soviet Union has taken many timely and correct measures to promote the peaceful resolution of the German problem, to reach agreements on the cessation and complete prohibition of nuclear weapons tests, the reduction of armaments, the cessation of the cold war, and the convening of a summit meeting.

The Congress instructs the Central Committee of the Party and the Soviet government to continue the struggle for the implementation of these and other proposals to ensure international peace and security.

The peace-loving peoples of all countries must strive not to allow the incitement of military attacks to poison the international atmosphere, and to build mutual trust and cooperation between countries, regardless of their social systems. The extensive development of world trade, cultural exchanges, and other forms of people-to-people contacts will play a major role in easing international tensions and strengthening mutual trust. Improving relations between the Soviet Union and the United States will have a decisive impact on the healthy development of the international situation, as the Soviet Union and the United States are two great powers with a special responsibility for the fate of the entire world.

The Soviet Union, guided by Lenin's principles of peaceful coexistence, will consistently strive for comprehensive cooperation with all countries. The growing strength of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, as well as the new achievements of Soviet science and technology, are fully dedicated to peace and the security of all peoples.

The Congress believes that the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan will once again demonstrate the internationalist obligations of the Soviet working people to the international workers' movement and the communist movement, as well as to all progressive humanity. The new achievements in the construction of a communist society will be a powerful spiritual support for all forces fighting for peace, democracy, and social progress. This support will be particularly significant when there are signs of a new offensive by reactionary and fascist forces in capitalist countries.

The turn of the reactionary bourgeoisie to open dictatorship is a sign of its weakness and inability to continue its rule through parliamentary methods. However, it should not be forgotten that under conditions of unrestrained dictatorship, the reactionaries will have greater opportunities to intensify repression and terror, suppress anti-government movements, train the masses in the spirit they need, poison them with chauvinistic toxins, and launch military adventures. The peoples of all countries should be vigilant and always ready to strike back against the attacks of the reactionaries and the revival of fascism. At the same time, it should be noted that fascism may revive in new forms, not in those that have already been discredited in the eyes of the people. The unity of democratic forces, first of all the unity of the working class, is the most reliable guarantee against the fascist danger. The successful advance of the Soviet Union along the path of communism, the continuous victories of the various socialist countries, and the unyielding struggle for peace will open up favorable prospects for the unity of action of the working class on an international and domestic scale. In the process of class struggle, the broad masses and organizations of the Social Democratic workers of capitalist countries will increasingly realize that the victory of socialism has opened up new possibilities for the international working class, and it can be expected that they will join the other ranks of the working class and the broad democratic strata to block the path of fascism and war.

The Congress noted with satisfaction that the meeting of the representatives of the communist and workers' parties in November 1957 demonstrated the complete unity of views among the fraternal parties. The declaration of the meeting was unanimously approved by all communist and workers' parties and has become the fighting program of action for the international communist movement. The correctness of the conclusions of the declaration has been completely confirmed by life. After the November meeting, the ranks of the communist parties of all countries and the entire international communist movement have become more united on the basis of Marxist-Leninist thought, and revisionism has been thoroughly defeated in thought and politics.

The revisionist program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia has been unanimously condemned by all Marxist-Leninist parties. The theory and practice of the Yugoslav leadership mean a deviation from the position of the working class and the principles of international proletarian unity. The views and policies of the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia have led to the destruction of the people's revolution and the achievements of socialism in Yugoslavia.

Soviet communists and the entire Soviet people have friendly feelings towards the fraternal people of Yugoslavia and the communists of Yugoslavia. In the struggle against imperialism and for peace, we will continue to seek cooperation with Yugoslavia wherever our positions coincide.

While continuing to expose the main danger of revisionism under current conditions in the communist movement, it is also necessary to intensify the struggle against dogmatism and sectarianism, as they hinder the creative application of Marxist-Leninist theory and lead to a detachment from the masses.

The Congress believes that it is necessary to strive to strengthen the power of the socialist camp on the basis of the principles of the Moscow Declaration, further strengthening the unity of the international communist movement. It is necessary to develop and expand the fraternal cooperation of communist and workers' parties on the basis of the complete independence of each party, proletarian internationalism, voluntary cooperation, and mutual assistance. The CPSU, educated in the spirit of proletarian internationalism by Lenin, has always considered itself a detachment in the international workers' movement and the communist movement. The CPSU, together with the communist parties of other countries, is responsible for the fate of the socialist camp and the fate of the world communist movement. The CPSU will continue to unyieldingly adhere to the great internationalist doctrine of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, fighting against various forms of revisionism, for the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and for new victories of the world communist movement and the workers' movement.

Our country has achieved a historic victory of socialism, creating the conditions for the transition to the new stage of communist construction, which is the result of the tireless creative labor of the Soviet people and the enormous political and organizational work of the Party. The Party, relying on the collective wisdom of the working class and all the people, relying on their rich experience, formulates and implements the plans for communist construction. Our Party, at the time of the convening of the 21st Congress, is more united and cohesive than ever, and is better able to successfully solve new and great tasks.

The boundless love and trust of the people for their dear Party is clearly evident in the fact that the ranks of the CPSU have been strengthened by the influx of outstanding figures from the working class, collective farmers, and Soviet intelligentsia. In the period after the 20th Congress, the Party has consistently pursued a policy of promoting party democracy, developing criticism and self-criticism, and increasing the activity of party members. The Central Committee and local party organizations have waged a resolute struggle to restore and further develop the Leninist principles of party life and the principles of collective leadership.

The entire experience of the struggle for the victory of socialism and communism proves that in the process of building a communist society, the role of the Party, as a tested vanguard of the people and the highest form of social organization, is constantly increasing.

To accomplish the Seven-Year Plan, it is necessary to further raise the level of all political, ideological, and organizational work of the Party, actively mobilize the creative forces of the Soviet people, make all workers understand the tasks of the plan, organize and mobilize the forces of each unit to accomplish these tasks, and resolutely eliminate shortcomings and overcome difficulties in work.

The success of the plan will directly depend on enterprises, construction sites, collective farms, state farms, and scientific institutions. Therefore, it is necessary to further enhance the role of local party organizations and primary party organizations, whose mission is to mobilize and organize the masses to accomplish specific production tasks. Party organizations must strive to create an atmosphere of creative labor and vigorous development in every enterprise, collective farm, state farm, and institution. It should be remembered that victory will not come by itself but must be striven for and consolidated.

Party organizations, propagandists, and agitators, when calling for the implementation of the communist construction plan, should explain in a simple and clear manner what communism is and what great benefits it will bring to people, and should fully support and develop various forms of communist labor. All means of party organizational and educational work, all means of party ideological work, should promote the smooth implementation of the tasks of communist construction. It is necessary to make every worker adopt advanced methods of labor, more effectively utilize machines, machine tools, machine sets, tractors, and combines.

The Congress believes that party and state cadres play a crucial role in the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan. It is necessary to improve the work of appointing and training cadres, promoting educated, principled, and sensitive people to leadership positions who will dedicate all their energy and knowledge to the well-being of the people, be filled with Bolshevik enthusiasm in their work, and be uncompromising towards shortcomings. It is necessary to more boldly promote young cadres, giving them the opportunity to demonstrate their abilities in practical work.

Party organizations have the responsibility to strengthen backward enterprises, collective farms, state farms, and districts with competent cadres, selecting outstanding organizers and specialists who can mobilize enormous potential and improve backward regions.

The responsibility of party organizations is to educate our cadres and all communist party members to strictly demand of themselves in their work, to have a high sense of responsibility, to educate them to serve the people faithfully and to be faithful to the cause of communism. It is necessary to constantly raise the theoretical level and Marxist-Leninist education of our cadres.

In raising the level of party organizational work and mobilizing the masses to solve the tasks of communist construction, it is increasingly important to adhere to party democracy, develop criticism and self-criticism as a powerful tool for eliminating shortcomings in work and advancing.

In the current stage of social development, the role of the Soviets, representing the working people, is further enhanced. The Soviets of the republics, territories, regions, cities, districts, and villages should constantly study the major issues of enterprises, construction sites, collective farms, and state farms in the implementation of the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan, and be concerned with improving the material well-being and culture of the working people. The more effectively the Soviets, relying on the initiative of the masses, further expand socialist democracy, and resolutely eliminate bureaucratic and official inertia, the more effective their work will be.

It is necessary to make certain amendments and additions to the Constitution of the USSR. Since the adoption of the Constitution, significant changes have occurred in the political and economic life of the Soviet Union, and the international situation has also changed. All these changes should be reflected in the Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and fixed in legal form.

In mobilizing the broad masses to successfully complete the Seven-Year Plan, trade unions will have to do a great deal of work. Trade unions should mobilize the activity of the working class and all working people, widely organize socialist competition to ensure that each enterprise fulfills and overfulfills the state tasks, support innovators, inventors, and advanced producers, and promote their experience. Trade unions must strengthen the supervision of labor protection in production, the implementation of housing construction plans, the distribution of housing space, the work of trade enterprises and public catering, and the medical and public utility services for the working people. An extremely important task of the trade unions is to conduct mass educational work and improve the work of cultural and educational institutions.

The seven-year program of communist construction adopted by our Party opens up a vast field for the initiative and creativity of the younger generation and their vanguard—the Leninist Communist Youth League. Members of the Komsomol should continue to be examples of selfless labor for the youth. Each Komsomol organization should be a fighting, vigorous, and closely connected with the youth collective. The Komsomol will actively participate in the construction of industry, housing, and cultural life, actively participate in the further development of socialist agriculture, and in the development of new natural resources in the country.

Party organizations and Komsomol organizations must pay special attention to the education of young people in the communist worldview, to the education of active and conscious builders of a communist society who love their homeland and know how to live and work in a communist way.

The main task of the Communist Party and the Soviet people today is to ensure the unconditional fulfillment of the Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. The implementation of the tasks set by the Party and the government for the next seven years will have tremendous significance for further strengthening the power of our country. The basic guideline of the Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the USSR is the peaceful development of the economy and the improvement of the well-being of the people. The implementation of this plan will simultaneously further strengthen the defensive capabilities of the USSR, making it better prepared to inflict a crushing blow on any imperialist aggression against the great achievements of socialism. The achievements of the peaceful economic construction of the USSR and all socialist countries will once again demonstrate the superiority of socialism over capitalism and will further increase the attractiveness of the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism.

The people of the Soviet Union, in the process of socialist construction, have created a great, universally recognized labor feat. The 21st Congress of the CPSU firmly believes that the entry of our society into the period of full-scale communist construction will inspire a surging wave of labor enthusiasm, new forms of all-people competition to complete and overfulfill the Seven-Year Plan will emerge, and this will be a sign of the most brilliant victory.

The magnificent program of communist construction adopted by the Party opens up a boundless, radiant prospect for the people of the Soviet Union on the path to communism. Our sacred goal is not far away. We will pass through the decisive stage of peaceful economic competition with capitalism and win this competition in the shortest possible time. We have all the necessary conditions to achieve this. When we solve these tasks and step into a new realm, our progress will be easier. To achieve the great goal of building communism, we must work hard and well.

The people of the Soviet Union, in close unity with the peoples of the socialist camp, are advancing along the path to communism. The powerful socialist camp is becoming stronger day by day. The ideas of communism are becoming the leading force of our time.

The 21st Congress of the CPSU calls on all the laboring people of our great homeland to actively struggle for the fulfillment and overfulfillment of the Seven-Year Plan. The Congress is fully confident that the workers, collective farmers, and Soviet intelligentsia will spare no effort to further strengthen the power of our socialist state and realize the communist ideal depicted on the banner of the victory of Marxism-Leninism.

The heroic people of the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the Communist Party, are advancing with unwavering confidence, creating the most beautiful and just society in the world—the communist society.

    苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会
    关于尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志所作“1959—1965年
    苏联发展国民经济的控制数字”的报告的决议
    新华社7日讯　塔斯社莫斯科6日电：苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会关于尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志所作“1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的控制数字”的报告的决议。
      （1959年2月5日一致通过）
    苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会是在极重要的历史时刻召开的，在这个时候苏维埃国家在社会生活各个领域中进行了极为深广的改革之后，已经在社会主义取得胜利的基础上进入了自己发展的新时期——全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期。过去许多代人曾为实现建立共产主义的伟大目标而努力奋斗，现在这个目标正被在共产党领导下的苏联人民实际地实现着。
    现在制定的苏联共产主义建设的纲领，使经济、文化和人民的物质福利获得新的巨大高涨的纲领，就其宏伟规模来说，是史无前例的。苏联发展国民经济的七年计划是现阶段党的列宁主义总路线的体现。
    代表大会对于代表大会前讨论尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志关于1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的控制数字的报告提纲的过程和结果，表示深深的满意。这次讨论强有力地显示了苏联人民的创造性主动性和积极性以及他们紧密团结在自己久经考验的领袖——共产党周围。全体苏联人民一致赞同发展国民经济的控制数字，把七年计划看成自己的血肉相关的事业，并且表示有充分的决心完成和超额完成计划的任务。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会决定：
    同意尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志关于1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的控制数字的提纲和报告；
    批准1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的控制数字以及在代表大会上和代表大会前讨论提纲的基础上提出的修改和补充；
    建议苏共中央委员会和苏联部长会议根据苏联国民经济的发展情况对依据代表大会批准的控制数字所拟定的苏联发展国民经济年度计划作必要的订正。
    一
    党的第二十次代表大会以后的这段时期是共产党和苏维埃国家历史上最重要的时期之一。由于实现了苏共代表大会和随后历次中央全会的决议，苏联人民在向共产主义迈进的道路上取得了卓越的成就。这个时期表明了，党的第二十次代表大会的决议无论对于苏联共产主义建设或对于整个国际共产主义运动和工人运动以及对于世界和平的巩固都具有巨大的意义。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会完全赞同中央委员会的活动和它在内政外交政策方面所采取的重大措施。党的重要决议，即关于工业和建筑业管理的改组，关于加速发展化学工业，关于改组机器拖拉机站和进一步发展集体农庄制度，关于增加农产品生产，关于加强学校同生活的联系和进一步发展国民教育制度的决议，对于提高经济、发展文化、增进劳动人民福利和建设共产主义具有巨大的意义。
    由于中央委员会和苏联政府的列宁主义的方针，由于苏联人民的忘我劳动，苏维埃国家的威力更加增长了，它的国际威信提高了。
    党中央委员会的全部活动的基础是：创造性地运用马克思列宁主义理论来解决共产主义建设的任务，深刻地研究群众的经验，同人民生活保持经常的联系，善于在历史发展的链条上找出决定性的环节，善于展示前景和发动群众，以及善于大胆和坚决地摧毁一切阻碍前进的过时事物。
    代表大会一致同意受到全党和全体人民拥护的中央六月（1957年）全会的决议。这次会议揭露了并从思想上粉碎了马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团。这个集团利用了最卑劣的派别斗争手段，企图破坏党的统一，使党和国家脱离列宁主义的道路。它反对为实现苏共第二十次代表大会决议而采取的一切重大措施，反对那些使我们在发展工农业、增进人民物质福利方面取得巨大成就，在外交政策方面争得国际紧张局势的缓和与和平事业的巩固的措施。中央委员会的处理是正确的，它坚决地谴责和摒弃了可耻的派别活动分子和分裂分子集团。党在揭露了和在思想上粉碎了反党集团以后，在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，更加紧密地团结在中央委员会的周围了。
    共产党由于忠实于马克思列宁主义，由于自己队伍的团结一致，由于同人民有紧密无间的联系，一直是无往不胜的。苏联人民把列宁的党看作是自己的久经考验的领袖和导师，把它的英明领导看作是取得共产主义的新成就的保证。
    共产党第二十一次代表大会怀着最大的满意和革命的自豪感总结苏联人民的伟大胜利。苏联人民的英勇斗争和劳动的最主要的成果是他们建立起来的新社会——社会主义以及与它相适应的政治制度——苏维埃社会主义国家。
    我们的国家已成为一个具有高度发展的经济和先进的科学文化的强大的社会主义国家。现在，苏联的工业产量占欧洲第一位，占世界第二位。1958年的工业总产值比1913年增加了三十五倍，其中生产资料的生产——整个国民经济的基础——增长了八十二倍，而机器制造业和金属加工工业的产值增长到二百四十倍。1958年我国的钢产量约为五千五百万吨，石油产量一亿一千三百万吨，煤产量四亿九千六百万吨，发电量二千三百三十亿度。
    在发展轻工业和食品工业方面也有巨大的成就。消费品的生产在1958年比1913年几乎增长了十三倍，其中文化—生活用品的产量增加了四十四倍多。目前日用品的产量比1940年多一点七倍。
    工业生产之所以取得巨大的规模和空前未有的高速度发展，是由于社会主义经济制度的优越性，是由于采用了最新的科学技术成就和开展了全民性的社会主义竞赛。在这个基础上，国民经济各部门的劳动生产率在不断提高。1958年在缩短工作日的情况下工业的劳动生产率比1913年提高了九倍，比1940年提高了一点六倍。
    在社会主义工业蓬勃发展的同时，农业也得到顺利发展。党对过去农业领导中的错误和缺点勇敢地进行了严厉的批评，排除了阻碍集体农庄和国营农场生产发展的一切障碍，拟定了急剧发展农业的纲领。党和苏联人民所制定和实行的进一步发展农业的措施，给我们祖国带来了丰硕的成果。1958年采购了三十五亿普特谷物，即比1953年多十六亿普特。由于开垦了几千万公顷新的土地，国家多得了数十亿普特的粮食。最近五年同前五年相比，谷物生产的平均年产量增加了39％。其他农作物的生产，特别是甜菜和棉花的生产，以及公有畜牧业的发展，都获得了很大的成就。
    苏维埃国家拥有强大的、全面发展的工业和高度机械化的农业。在社会主义经济普遍高涨的基础上，国家的社会财富不断增加，人民的物质福利和文化不断提高。在苏维埃政权的年代里，按人口平均计算的国民收入增加了十四倍。1958年工人和职员的实际收入比1940年差不多增加了一倍，而农民的实际收入，按每个参加劳动的人计算，增加了一倍多。
    为了实现苏共第二十次代表大会的决议采取了这样一些重大措施：提高低工资工人和职员的工资，缩短节日和假日前的工作日，许多重工业部门的工人和职员过渡到更短的工作日，为未成年工人规定六小时和四小时工作日，改善劳动人民社会保险津贴的情况，延长产前和产后的假期，大大地提高工人和职员的优抚金。苏维埃国家拨出越来越多的资金来满足劳动人民的物质和文化需要。
    共产党培养了千百万的新人——自觉的共产主义建设者。这是社会主义制度最辉煌的成就。
    在苏维埃国家中，各民族和部族人民的文化达到了真正的繁荣，为全面而自由地发展科学、技术、文学和艺术提供了无限的可能性。世界历史上第一批人造地球卫星和第一个围绕太阳旋转的人造行星的发射成功，是我国高度工业技术水平和苏联人民创造天才的鲜明表现。苏维埃国家以自己在科学技术思想方面的伟大胜利，开辟了认识世界的新时代。这些胜利的伟大意义在于，它们显示了为人类的利益、为人类进步和繁荣而服务的社会主义的强大的创造力量。苏联人民看到自己的祖国走在世界科学技术进步的最前面和勇敢地在开辟通向未来的道路，心中充满爱国主义的自豪感。
    苏联人民在经济和文化方面的历史性胜利，党和政府最近几年来所实行的措施，使苏维埃制度及其不可动摇的基础——工农联盟进一步巩固了。苏维埃国家各兄弟民族的友谊更加紧密了，他们在政治上的统一更加巩固了。苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟向全世界做出榜样，它是自由平等民族的共产主义大家庭。
    为人类开辟了通往社会主义道路的苏联，在生产力、社会主义生产关系和文化发展方面达到了这样的水平，以至在今后七年中能够在广泛的战线上展开共产主义社会的建设。
    二
    苏共第二十一次代表大会认为党在今后七年中的主要任务是：
    在经济方面：全面发展国家的生产力，在优先发展重工业的基础
  上，使一切经济部门的生产获得这样的增长，以保证在建立共产主义的物质技术基础方面和保证苏联在同资本主义国家的和平经济竞赛中取得胜利方面迈出决定性的一步。国家的经济力量的加强、一切国民经济部门的技术的进一步发展和社会劳动生产率的不断提高，将保证人民生活水平的大大提高；
    在政治方面：进一步巩固苏维埃社会主义制度，进一步加强苏联人民的统一与团结，发展苏维埃民主和广大人民群众在建设共产主义社会中的积极性和主动性，扩大各社会团体在解决国家问题中的职能，提高党和社会主义国家的组织作用和教育作用，大力加强工农联盟和苏联各族人民的友谊；
    在思想方面：加强党的思想教育工作，提高劳动者、首先是年青一代的共产主义觉悟，用共产主义的劳动态度、苏维埃爱国主义和国际主义的精神教育他们，克服人们意识中的资本主义残余，同资产阶级思想体系作斗争；
    在国际关系方面：根据列宁的关于不同社会制度的国家和平共处的原则，坚定不移地奉行维护与巩固和平和各国人民安全的外交政策；执行停止“冷战”和缓和国际紧张局势的方针；大力加强世界社会主义体系和各兄弟人民的大家庭。
    今后七年的根本问题是在社会主义同资本主义的和平经济竞赛中最大限度地赢得时间。必须保证国民经济发展的高速度和必要的比例。
    苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会认为工业的发展，特别是重工业的发展具有头等重要的意义，并且认为在七年计划中必须规定工业总产值大约增加80％，其中第一部类（生产资料的生产）增加85％到88％，第二部类（消费资料的生产）增加62％到65％。规定在1959—1965年工业总产值每年平均增加约8.6％，第一部类为9.3％，第二部类约为7.3％。
    代表大会认为有必要在七年计划中规定：
    大大增加黑色和有色金属的生产，以便更充分地满足国民经济的需要。1965年生铁的产量要达到六千五百万至七千万吨，钢达到八千六百万至九千一百万吨，钢材的生产达到六千五百万至七千万吨，商品铁矿的开采量达到一亿五千万至一亿六千万吨；铝的生产大约增加一点八倍至两倍，精铜增加90％，其他有色金属，特别是稀有金属的产量也要大大提高；
    加速发展化学工业，特别是人造纤维和合成纤维、塑料和其他合成材料以及矿质肥料的生产。到七年终了时，人造纤维的生产要增加三倍，塑料和合成树脂将增加六倍以上，矿质肥料大约增加两倍；
    改变燃料平衡结构，要优先发展最经济的燃料——石油和瓦斯的开采和生产。保证1965年石油开采量达到二亿三千万至二亿四千万吨，瓦斯的开采量和生产量达到一千五百亿立方公尺，煤的开采量达到六亿至六亿一千二百万吨；
    迅速发展国民经济各部门的电气化，主要是依靠建设大型热电站。到1965年，电力的年产量要增加到五千亿度到五千二百亿度；
    高速发展机器制造业和仪器制造业，以便用新的具有高度生产效能的设备、机器和仪器来装备企业，实现生产的全盘机械化和自动化。七年中要把机械制造业和金属加工业产品产量提高一倍左右。
    代表大会认为，必须在重工业发展的高度水平和农业进一步发展的基础上，规定大大增加消费品的生产，从而在七年内保证充分满足居民对纺织品、服装、鞋类和其他商品的需求。
    要实现这项任务，以1965年同1958年相比：
    轻工业总产值增加大约50％，其中棉织品的生产增加33％到38％，毛织品增加65％，丝织品增加76％，皮鞋增加45％。
    食品工业总产值大约增加70％，其中肉类增加约110％，动物油脂增加58％，奶制品增加120％，糖增加76％到90％，鱼增加60％。
    应该特别注意增加工业品和食品的品种，并改进其质量，增加家庭日用品的生产。
    所有党组织应当保证各企业有节奏的生产，以使国家计划的各项产量和质量指标逐日逐月都能完成和超额完成。必须更充分地挖掘各企业的内在潜力和可能性，以便在现有生产能力的情况下增加产量，不断改进工艺规程和生产的组织，改进对设备、原料和材料的利用。
    农业方面的基本任务就是要使生产水平发展到能够充分满足居民对食品、工业对原料的需要，并且保证国家对农产品的一切其他需要。解决这项任务的办法首先应该是大大提高各种农作物单位面积产量，增加牲畜的头数和进一步提高公有畜牧业的产品生产率。
    七年中农业总产值将增加70％，而某些最重要的产品产量应达到如下水平：谷物——一百亿到一百一十亿普特，甜菜——七千六百万到八千四百万吨，原棉——五百七十万到六百一十万吨，肉类（按屠宰重计算）——一千六百万吨，奶类——一亿到一亿零五百万吨，马铃薯——一亿四千七百万吨，蔬菜的数量要充分满足居民的需要。
    今后农业方面的主要方针仍然是全力提高作为整个农业生产基础的谷物的生产。现在集体农庄和国营农场有一切条件在最近几年内普遍把谷物每公顷的平均产量提高三公担至四公担。在畜牧业方面，基本任务是增加肉类、奶类、羊毛和蛋类的产量，要达到这一点应该增加牲畜头数和提高各种牲畜的产品生产率，发展集体农庄和国营农场牧场中的养禽业和养兔业，必须更加坚持不懈地加强畜牧业的饲料基地，这里首先是要增加玉蜀黍、马铃薯、甜菜的生产，增加像三叶草、苜蓿、箭舌豌豆—燕麦混播物、豌豆、羽扁豆以及其它这样一类的蛋白质饲料的生产，增产要结合各地区的特点。必须增加大豆的生产。
    顺利地完成和超额完成采购各种农产品的年度计划是一项重要任务。
    代表大会表示相信，由于全国展开了一个运动，争取提前完成控制数字所规定的在农产品生产方面的任务，特别是肉类和其他畜产品生产有可能在时间和数量上不仅完成而且超额完成七年计划。各共和国、边疆区和州已经制订了今后几年扩大农产品生产的具体措施，并且保证在1959年就要把肉类产量增加一倍到二倍或二倍以上，它们这种创举应该得到全力支持。各共和国、边疆区、州、区、集体农庄和国营农场完成自己的保证，就能对实现先进集体农庄和国营农场的倡议——在短时期内在按人口平均计算的肉类和其他农产品产量方面赶上美国——作出宝贵的贡献。在这方面，每一个共和国、边疆区、州、区、集体农庄和国营农场所作的贡献的大小，应该按每一百公顷土地的畜产品产量来计算。
    为了顺利地解决今后七年农业所面临的巨大任务，党、苏维埃和农业机构必须全力巩固集体农庄的公有经济，采取重大措施来进一步实现农业生产的机械化、电气化和改善劳动组织，在这个基础上保证大大提高劳动生产率和降低农产品的成本。作为农业中主导的社会主义企业的国营农场应当发挥更大的作用。
    在执行进一步扩大农业生产措施的同时，必须用集体农庄、国营农场和消费合作社的力量来展开农产品加工企业的建设，全力扩大农村住宅和文化福利建设，展开农村的公用事业建设工作。由于集体农庄收入的增加，必须更广泛地采取几个集体农庄合资的办法来建设发电站，铺设道路，建设建筑材料企业和规模宏大、设备完善的集体农庄联营罐头工厂、面包工厂和其他企业。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会认为，发展农业生产各部门的问题今后也应当是党、苏维埃和农业机构以及集体农庄和国营农场全体劳动者的一项主要工作。
    为了使国民经济达到高速度的发展，应该发展各种运输。在七年内应该实现对几种主要的运输进行根本的技术改革，特别是对铁路运输，必须用经济上合算的电气机车和内燃机车来代替蒸汽机车。还应该竭力增加海上、内河、航空和公路的运输量，扩大管道运输，利用对各地区和不同货物说来都最经济合算的运输种类。必需发展电话通讯、广播电台和电视台网。
    代表大会认为，广泛地采用新技术、生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化，国民经济各部门的专业化和协作，是顺利完成七年计划和建立共产主义物质技术基础的决定性条件。七年内的任务是在工业、农业、建筑业和运输业的生产过程全盘机械化的基础上消灭繁重的手工劳动。
    鉴于实现生产机械化和更广泛的自动化的措施不仅具有经济意义，而且具有重大的社会意义，代表大会责成党中央委员会和地方党的机关对实现生产全盘机械化和自动化的一切措施进行毫不放松的监督。
    必须在最有效地利用天然资源的基础上，并且在考虑到企业的适当专业化、改善企业和经济区间的协作联系以及消除不合理的运输的情况下，坚持不懈地实现各经济区的进一步综合发展。
    为了达到高速度的社会主义扩大再生产，代表大会认为必须在今后七年中在基本建设方面采取巨大措施。国家投资额将比前七年增加80％，总额大约为一万九千四百亿至一万九千七百亿卢布，这差不多等于苏维埃政权全部年代的国民经济基本建设投资额的总和。为了最合理地利用基本建设投资，应当把更多的资金用于改建、扩建和在技术上重新装备现有企业，革新设备和使设备现代化，这样就有可能比建设新企业花费更少的钱，而且更快地解决增加产量和提高劳动生产率的任务。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会注意到，为了及时地完成规定的基本建设工程量，必须继续采取使建筑业尽量工业化的方针，把建筑业的生产变为用工厂制造的大型部件和构件装配建筑物的机械化流水作业过程。必须加速发展建筑材料工业，特别是水泥工业，扩大钢筋混凝土结构的生产，应当更大胆地合并建筑机构，改进设计工作，把投资集中用于最重要的、已经动工的工程项目，争取缩短建筑期限，降低成本，改进建筑安装工程质量。
    鉴于建筑业在今后七年中具有空前规模以及必须做到最大限度地节省社会劳动和赢得时间。因此，应当特别注意正确地配置生产力。应当注意进一步发展我国天然资源丰富的东部地区的经济。在解决生产能力的进一步增长的问题时，应该优先注意那些能使投资发挥最大经济效能的地区。党组织必须力使国家利益得到最严格的维护，必须根除本位主义的任何微小表现。
    苏联是一个以各平等民族的友谊为基础的多民族的社会主义国家。苏联各族人民怀着共同的意志和愿望，始终不渝地沿着共产主义建设的道路前进。我们的各项计划鲜明地体现了列宁的民族政策，这个政策保证各族人民的经济和文化有全面发展的广泛可能性。
    七年计划规定大大发展各加盟共和国的经济。在每一个共和国内，首先要发展那些拥有自然条件和经济条件的经济部门，以便更有效地利用每一个共和国的资源，并保证把各个共和国的利益同整个苏联的利益正确地结合起来。
    代表大会认为，大大提高社会劳动生产率（这是扩大社会主义再生产和积累的主要源泉，是进一步提高人民生活水平的基础）是七年计划的极重要的任务。在七年期间，工业的劳动生产率将要增长45％—50％，建筑业增长60％—65％，铁路运输增长34％—37％，国营农场增长60％—65％，集体农庄约增长一倍。
    必须缩减生产费用，以便在七年内使工业生产成本至少减低11.5％，建筑安装工程费用至少减低6％。
    所有的党组织、经济组织、工会和共青团组织，都必须为完成和超额完成七年计划中关于提高劳动生产率和缩减生产费用的任务、为厉行节约而展开斗争。必须组织一个全民性的运动来反对一切铺张浪费现象和对人民财产漫不经心的态度。必须加强领导者对改进企业、建筑工地的一切质量指标的责任心，特别是加强他们对降低产品成本和提高产品质量的责任心。必须全力加强工业、交通运输业和农业中的经济核算。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会认为，在目前的条件下，在工业和农业发展中取得了重大成就的情况下，有一切条件在最近时期内使苏联人民生活得更加美好，使他们的物质和精神需要得到更充分的满足。为此，七年计划规定：
    国民收入增长62％—65％。这将保证人民消费的大大提高，七年之内人民的消费总额将增加60％到63％；
    七年之内职工的实际收入，按每个职工平均计算将提高40％，而集体农民的实际收入至少将增加40％；
    在最近几年内取消对居民的征税；
    采取措施调整工资，七年中把低工资职工的工资由每月二百七十至三百五十卢布提高到五百至六百卢布；
    提高养老金的最低限额，在城市中从目前的每月三百卢布提高到每月四百卢布，而把长期住在农业地区并和农业有联系的老人的养老金由二百五十五卢布提高到三百四十卢布；并提高残废抚恤金和赡养金的最低限额；
    大大改善对居民的商业服务和生活服务的工作，扩大公共饮食企业网和降低公共饮食企业产品的价格；
    增加寄宿学校、托儿所、幼儿园、养老院；
    大规模进行住宅和公用事业建设，在今后七年中要在城市和工人村中建造总面积为六亿五千万到六亿六千万平方公尺的住宅，即约一千五百万套房间，在农村地区将用集体农民和农村知识分子的力量建造约七百万幢房子；
    实现缩短工作日和工作周的措施。在1960年，工人和职员要过渡到七小时工作日，而在煤炭工业和采矿工业中从事地下劳动的主要工序的工人则将过渡到六小时工作日。在1962年，七小时工作日的工人和职员将过渡到四十小时的工作周。从1964年起，开始把从事地下劳动和在有害健康的劳动条件下从事生产的工作者逐渐过渡到三十小时工作周，并把所有其余工作者过渡到三十五小时工作周，即工作日为六—七小时，每周有两个休息日；
    国营贸易和合作社贸易的零售商品流通额约增加62％。大大增加对居民的畜产品、植物油、糖、水果、柑桔、最重要的工业品——布匹、服装、内衣、鞋类以及文化生活用品和杂货的销售量，特别是增加那些减轻妇女在日常生活中的劳动的货品的销售量。
    实现所有这些措施，将是我国劳动人民新的极伟大的成果，是苏联共产党和苏联政府不倦地关怀苏联人民福利的鲜明表现。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会认为，实现共产主义建设的宏伟计划要求各级党、苏维埃、工会和共青团组织进一步改进教育苏联人的全部工作，提高他们的觉悟和积极性，用集体主义和勤劳的精神，用社会责任感的精神，用社会主义的国际主义和爱国主义的精神，用不懈地遵守共产主义道德的崇高原则的精神，来培养新人。
    对劳动人民进行共产主义教育，克服人们意识中的资本主义残余，应当成为各级党、苏维埃、工会、共青团和其他社会团体注意的中心和工作中心。必须继续同敌对的资产阶级思想意识进行不调和的斗争。在党的思想工作中，宣传鼓动工作、报刊、电影、广播和电视以及文化教育机关应当起重要的作用。
    应该特别重视对正在成长中的一代进行共产主义教育。各级党和苏维埃组织应该保证坚定不移地实现有关改革中等学校和高等学校的一切措施，使苏维埃学校作到教育同生产、同共产主义建设的实践紧密结合，从而培养出受过全面教育和有觉悟的公民、中级和高级的专门人才。
    在建设共产主义社会的当前时期，科学的作用日益重大。代表大会指出，苏联科学在一切知识领域内，特别是在核物理学和原子动力学方面，在喷气式飞机和火箭技术方面都获得巨大成就。代表大会同时认为，必须在七年内使所有科学部门都得到更快的发展，进行重要的理论研究工作以保证科学技术的进一步发展。为此，应拟订出科学研究工作的广泛规划，把科学界的人力和物力集中于具有实际意义和理论意义的最重要方面。应当不断加强科学机关同实践的联系，广泛而且迅速地把科学技术的最新成就应用到国民经济中，更大胆地进行试验和设计工作。
    社会科学方面，特别是经济学方面的任务是，创造性地概括经济和文化建设的经验，研究生活所提出的各种新的问题。必须深入研究向共产主义过渡的规律性，全面分析资本主义世界中所发生的一些极重要的过程，揭穿资产阶级思想体系，为马克思列宁主义理论的纯洁性而斗争。
    今后的七年应该标志出社会主义文化的进一步发展。文学、戏剧、电影、音乐、雕刻和绘画工作者的使命是进一步提高自己作品的思想和艺术水平，他们今后仍将成为党和国家在对劳动人民进行共产主义教育、宣传共产主义道德和发展多民族的社会主义文化方面的积极助手。
    三
    苏共第二十一次代表大会确定共产主义建设现阶段任务时的出发点是，苏联已经进入了新的历史发展时期。
    社会主义在我国取得了完全的和彻底的胜利。苏联曾经是处于敌对的资本主义包围中的唯一的一个社会主义国家，这样的时期已经过去了。现在有两个世界社会体系：过了时的资本主义和充满蒸蒸日上的生命力的社会主义。全世界各国劳动人民都同情社会主义。现在世界上没有任何力量能够在我国恢复资本主义，能够战胜社会主义阵营。
    苏联人民在党的领导下，取得了社会主义在经济生活和社会政治生活的一切领域内的巨大胜利，以致使我们有可能切实地实现建立共产主义社会的物质技术基础和有计划地过渡到共产主义的任务。只有在我们超过发达的资本主义国家的生产水平，并能保证比在资本主义制度下更高的劳动生产率的情况下，才能实现共产主义。
    全面展开的共产主义建设，必须在保证有丰裕的物质财富的同时，保证有真正丰富的精神文化，保证日益充分地满足一切人的需要，并保证进一步发展社会主义民主和培养自觉的共产主义社会的劳动者。
    随着生产力的增长，以同志式的合作、友谊和互助为基础的社会主义的社会关系也应该日趋完善。随着经济各部门的技术进步以及教育同生产的更加密切的结合，脑力和体力劳动之间的本质差别将逐渐消失，全体劳动人民的文化技术水平将逐渐提高。在生产的全盘机械化和自动化的基础上缩短工作日和进一步改善劳动条件，会促使劳动成为全面发展的人的生活需要。
    由于最近几年实施了使农业高涨和集体农庄公有经济增长的措施，集体农庄制度已变得日益巩固，它的优越性和内在的巨大潜力也日益充分地显露了出来。所有这些都表明，生产关系的集体农庄—合作社形式，正在为农业生产力的发展服务，并且在今后的一个长时间里还能够为它服务。
    在共产主义建设过程中，集体农庄生产的公有化水平将得到提高，集体农庄—合作社所有制将同全民所有制接近，两者之间的界线将逐渐消灭。集体农庄的公积金将不断增加和扩大，集体农庄间的生产联系将越来越广泛地发展。所有制的集体农庄—合作社形式和全民形式的融合，将不是由于集体农庄—合作社所有制的收缩，而是通过在社会主义国家的帮助和支援下把它的公有化水平提高到全民所有制而发生的。
    在共产主义建设的目前条件下，“各尽所能，按劳分配”的原则，仍然是分配物质财富的指导原则。按劳分配保证人们从物质利益上关心生产的成果，刺激劳动生产率的增长，提高工作人员的业务水平，改进生产技术；按劳分配也能起巨大的教育作用，使人们习惯于社会主义纪律，使劳动成为普遍的和必需的。平均主义的分配会把积累下来的资金都浪费掉，并为共产主义建设带来损害。
    随着社会主义社会的发展和群众觉悟程度的提高，苏联人的劳动热情越来越高，他们对社会福利的关怀会日益增长，发财致富的欲望会日益消除，从精神上激发人们从事为社会谋福利的劳动，具有越来越大的意义。
    向按需分配的过渡将是随着生产力的发展逐渐实现的，那时，一切必需的消费品都非常丰裕，所有的人都能不论所取得的物质财富多少而自愿地、尽其所能地劳动，并意识到这是社会所需要的。
    在苏维埃社会里现在已经有很大的、日益增长的一部分物质和文化财富，是用优抚金、学生助学金、多子女母亲补助费的形式，用学校、医院、幼儿园、托儿所、寄宿学校以及俱乐部、图书馆和其他文化机关的建筑费和经费的形式，免费分配的。这一部分社会消费基金将日益增加，这是逐渐过渡到共产主义分配原则的重要前提。
    代表大会指出，在现在的条件下，社会主义国家组织发展中的主要方向是尽力发展民主，吸引全体公民参加领导经济和文化建设的工作，参加管理社会事务的工作。作为劳动人民的群众组织的苏维埃的作用必须提高。国家机关现在所履行的许多职能应该逐渐过渡到由社会团体来履行。对居民的文化服务、保健、体育运动等问题，应当在社会团体积极广泛参加下解决。在维护社会主义公共生活准则方面，人民纠察队、同志审判会和这一类的社会机关将起越来越重要的作用，这些机关应当同国家机构共同执行维护社会秩序和公民权利的职能，防止危害社会的行为。
    把国家机关的某些职能移交给社会团体，并不会削弱社会主义国家在共产主义建设中的作用，而是扩大和加强社会主义社会的政治基础，保证社会主义民主的进一步发展。苏维埃国家将能够集中更大精力来发展作为我们制度物质基础的经济。
    社会主义国家在捍卫和平、防御帝国主义国家军事进攻威胁方面所负的任务是特别重大的。只要帝国主义侵略阵营和侵略性的军事集团还存在，苏维埃国家就必须加强和提高捍卫着苏联人民的社会主义成果及和平劳动的光荣武装部队——陆军和海军。必须加强国家保安机关。它的矛头首先指向帝国主义国家派来的间谍。国家目前所履行的保卫社会主义祖国的职能只有在帝国主义者进攻的危险完全消除的时候才能消亡。
    四
    代表大会坚决相信，七年计划的实现，将进一步加强作为和平和进步的强大堡垒的苏联及世界社会主义阵营的阵地，将进一步增强和平力量和削弱战争势力。七年计划的成就将是战无不胜的马克思列宁主义学说的极伟大的胜利，将是社会主义比资本主义优越的明证。这些成就将把千百万新的信仰者吸引到社会主义方面来。
    七年计划开辟了社会主义同资本主义进行经济竞赛的新阶段。沿着列宁主义道路前进的苏联人民的巨大劳动，已经把我国提高到这样的高度：它现在可以胜利地同美国在经济方面进行竞赛，在这场竞赛中赢得胜利并且把这个主要的资本主义国家抛到后面去。在这方面，我国生产增长的高速度将具有决定性的意义。
    在七年计划完成时，苏联在按人口平均计算的工业产品产量上将超过现在欧洲最发达的资本主义国家英国和西德，而在这个指标方面跃居欧洲第一位。在若干最主要的产品的绝对生产量方面，苏联将超过美国现在的工业生产水平，而在其他产品的绝对产量方面将接近美国现在的工业生产水平。到那时候，重要农产品的总产量和按人口平均计算的产量都将超过美国现在的水平。要在按人口平均计算的工业产量方面赶上并超过美国，大概在完成七年计划以后，还需要五年。因此，到那个时候，也可能更早一些，苏联就会在工业产品的绝对产量和按人口平均计算的产量方面跃居世界第一位。这将是社会主义在同资本主义进行和平竞赛中取得的具有世界历史意义的胜利。
    资本主义国家发展的特点则完全不同。资本主义总危机由于社会主义力量的增长、殖民体系的瓦解和内部社会矛盾的尖锐化，在继续加深。资本主义经济的动荡正在加剧，它经历着一次又一次危机式的生产下降。不管是军备竞赛，还是资本主义国家采取的其他措施，都不能消减产生危机的原因。资本主义的矛盾还在继续增多，孕育着新的动荡。
    在世界舞台上，世界社会主义体系同世界资本主义体系进行着经济竞赛。世界社会主义体系各国的经济在飞速发展。生产的高速度发展是现在为社会主义阵营各国的经验所证实了的社会主义普遍规律性。由于社会主义工业化和农民走上合作道路的结果，某些人民民主国家已经进入完成社会主义的建立的时期。
    根据经济学家计算，在七年计划完成和超额完成以后，以及由于人民民主国家的经济高速度发展，世界社会主义体系的工业产量将占世界工业总产量的一半以上。这样就将在物质生产这个人类活动的决定性范围方面，保证世界社会主义体系对世界资本主义体系占有优势。
    社会主义国家经济发展的特点是，随着它们的不断前进，相互之间的关系也不断巩固，世界社会主义体系的团结也更加加强。资本主义世界的发展趋势却完全相反，在那里，这一个或那一个国家的生产的增长都会加深资本主义国家间的矛盾，加剧竞争，引起相互之间的冲突。
    随着世界社会主义体系的进一步壮大和加强，所有的社会主义国家也都将得到日益顺利的发展。从前经济上落后的国家，依靠其他社会主义国家的经验，依靠合作和互助，正在迅速地使自己的经济和文化赶上去。这样，所有社会主义国家的经济和文化发展的共同水平就平衡起来，并将以日益增快的速度为从共产主义第一阶段过渡到第二阶段创造前提。这些国家像苏联一样建设共产主义社会的时间日益临近了。
    苏联认为，继续促使社会主义国家加强团结，促使它们发展它们之间的密切经济联系和文化联系，促使各自由民族的亲睦的大家庭在马克思列宁主义的伟大思想和无产阶级国际主义的原则的基础上更加团结，是自己的一项重要任务。
    代表大会认为，七年计划的实现，以及其他社会主义国家经济计划的实现，将为解决当前的基本问题——维护世界和平——创造更为有利的条件。党的第二十次代表大会所作的关于战争并不是注定不可避免的结论，已证明是完全正确的。现在世界上存在着巨大的力量能够捍卫住和平，能够在帝国主义侵略者发动战争的时候使侵略者遭到毁灭性的失败。帝国主义国家对社会主义阵营的侵略只能有一个结局，这就是资本主义的灭亡。
    社会主义阵营各国的新成就一定使全世界爱好和平的力量发展和加强。同主张巩固和平的国家联合起来的国家将越来越多。不许发动战争这个想法将更加巩固地在各国人民的头脑中生根。那时，爱好和平的各国人民就能依靠社会主义阵营的实力迫使帝国主义的好战集团放弃发动新战争的计划。这样一来，在社会主义还没有在地球上完全胜利以前，在资本主义还在世界部分地区存在的时候，就会出现把世界大战从人类社会生活中消除掉的实际可能性。
    但是，现在帝国主义发动战争的可能性仍然存在，不能轻视战争的危险。因此，社会主义国家和所有爱好和平的力量都应当保持最大的警惕性，更加努力地保卫和平。
    美帝国主义的侵略政策仍然是战争危险的主要泉源，这种侵略政策反映着美国垄断资本称霸世界的野心。美国统治集团，以及西德、英国、法国和参加北大西洋侵略集团的其他国家的统治集团，在继续蓄存原子武器，拒绝和平解决国际问题，不断在世界各地挑起军事冲突。同时西德正在扮演北大西洋联盟的主要打击力量的角色，它目前正在变成这个联盟的主要的原子武器和火箭基地。军国主义和复仇主义在西德已抬起头来，并威胁着爱好和平的各国人民。
    近年来的经验表明，帝国主义的侵略威胁着世界各个地区的人民。帝国主义分子在近东、中东和在太平洋地区煽起军事冲突，对争取自由的非洲各民族采取军事行动，并经常威胁着要对拉丁美洲各国的内政进行武装干涉。
    在这种情况下，特别迫切地需要爱好和平的各国人民为建立集体安全、为不再用战争来解决国际争端而进行斗争。
    西方国家的侵略方针，同苏联和一切社会主义国家奉行的、受到爱好和平的各国人民拥护的和平方针针锋相对。近几年内，由于社会主义阵营各国和东方爱好和平的国家采取坚定的立场，把中近东和远东的战火在刚一露头的时候就扑灭下去，并粉碎了帝国主义者的其它阴谋。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会，一致批准了苏联政府的列宁主义和平外交政策，这个政策是设在帝国主义侵略者道路上的不可逾越的障碍。最近，苏联又及时地、正确地采取了许多措施，来争取和平解决德国问题，争取就停止试验和完全禁止核武器、裁减军备、停止冷战，以及召开政府首脑会议等问题达成协议。
    代表大会委托党中央委员会和苏联政府今后继续为实现这些及其它一些保障国际和平与安全的建议而进行彻底的斗争。
    爱好和平的各国人民必须努力不使煽动军事进攻的叫嚣毒化国际气氛，力求建立各国间的互相信任和合作，不管它们是属于什么社会制度。广泛发展世界贸易、文化交流和各国人民交往的其它形式，会在缓和国际紧张局势和加强相互信任中起重大的作用。改善苏联和美国的关系，对于促进国际局势的健康发展，会起决定性的作用，因为苏联和美国是两个大国，它们对全世界的命运负有特殊的责任。
    苏联遵循列宁的和平共处原则，将始终不渝地力求同一切国家进行全面的合作。苏联和整个社会主义阵营日益增长的实力，以及苏联科学和技术的新成就，完全服务于和平与各国人民的安全。
    代表大会认为，七年计划的实行，又一次证明苏联劳动人民在对国际工人运动和共产主义运动以及对全体进步人类履行其国际主义义务。共产主义社会建设中的新成就对于一切为和平、民主和社会进步而斗争的力量是强有力的精神上的支持。当资本主义国家里出现反动派和法西斯势力有发动新攻势的迹象时，这种支持就具有特别的意义。
    反动的资产阶级转而采取了公开的独裁统治，这是它软弱的标志，是它无力以议会的方法继续维持其统治的标志。但是不能忘记，在独裁不受任何限制的条件下，反动派会有更大的可能来加剧迫害和恐怖，镇压反政府运动，用他们所需要的精神来训练群众，以沙文主义的毒素来毒害他们，并放手进行军事冒险。各国人民应该警惕，时刻准备给反动派的进攻和法西斯主义复活的威胁以打击。同时应该注意，法西斯主义可能以新的、而不是以已经在人民心目中声名扫地的形式复活。民主力量的团结一致，首先是工人阶级的团结一致是堵塞法西斯危险的最可靠的保证。苏联沿着共产主义道路顺利前进，各个社会主义国家不断取得胜利，坚持不懈地为争取和平而进行斗争，所有这一切，就为求得工人阶级在国际和国内范围内的行动一致开辟了有利的前景。在阶级斗争的过程中，资本主义国家广大的社会民主党工人群众和组织将日益认识到，社会主义的胜利，已经给国际工人阶级开辟了新的可能性，可以设想，他们一定会同工人阶级的其他队伍和广大民主阶层一道堵塞法西斯主义和战争的道路。
    代表大会满意地指出，1957年11月的共产党和工人党代表会议显示出各兄弟党观点的完全一致。会议宣言得到了所有共产党和工人党的一致赞同，它已成为国际共产主义运动的战斗的行动纲领。宣言的结论的正确性已完全为生活所证实。在11月会议以后，各国共产党的队伍和整个国际共产主义运动在马克思列宁主义思想基础上的团结加强了，修正主义在思想上和政治上已被彻底粉碎。
    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的修正主义纲领遭到了所有马克思列宁主义政党的一致谴责。南斯拉夫领导集团的理论和实践意味着背离工人阶级立场，背离国际无产阶级团结的原则。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导人的观点和政策使南斯拉夫的人民革命和社会主义的成果遭到了破坏。
    苏联共产党人、全体苏联人民对兄弟的南斯拉夫人民，对南斯拉夫的共产主义者抱着友好的感情。在反对帝国主义、争取和平的问题上，凡是我们双方的立场将吻合的，我们将继续力求同南斯拉夫合作。
    在继续揭露目前条件下共产主义运动中的主要危险修正主义的同时，也不能放松同教条主义和宗派主义的斗争，因为它们阻碍马克思列宁主义理论的创造性的运用，导致脱离群众。
    代表大会认为必须根据莫斯科宣言的原则努力加强社会主义阵营的威力，进一步加强国际共产主义运动的团结。必须在每个党完全独立自主的基础上，在无产阶级国际主义、自愿合作和互助的基础上发展和扩大共产党和工人党的兄弟合作。列宁用无产阶级国际主义精神教育出来的苏联共产党，向来都把自己看作是国际工人运动和共产主义运动中的一个支队。苏联共产党同其他国家的共产党一道对社会主义阵营的命运、对世界共产主义运动的命运负有责任。苏联共产党今后仍将坚持不懈地遵循马克思、恩格斯和列宁的伟大的国际主义学说，为反对形形色色的修正主义，为马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，为世界共产主义运动和工人运动的新胜利而斗争。
    我国取得了社会主义的历史性胜利，从而为过渡到共产主义建设的新阶段创造了条件，这是苏联人民不懈地进行了创造性劳动以及共产党进行了巨大的政治工作和组织工作的结果。党依靠工人阶级和全体人民的集体智慧，依靠他们的丰富经验，制定和实现共产主义建设的计划。我们的党在召开第二十一次代表大会的时候，比任何时期都更加统一和团结，更加能够顺利地解决新的巨大的任务。
    人民对自己亲爱的党的无限爱戴和信任明显地表现在，苏联共产党的队伍由于吸收工人阶级、集体农民和苏维埃知识分子中的优秀人物参加而得到壮大。在第二十次代表大会以后的这段时期内，党一贯地执行了发扬党内民主、开展批评与自我批评和提高党员群众积极性的路线。中央委员会和各级地方党组织为恢复和进一步发展党的生活的列宁主义准则和集体领导的原则进行了坚决的斗争。
    为争取社会主义和共产主义的胜利而斗争的全部经验证明，在建设共产主义社会的过程中，作为久经考验的人民先锋队和最高社会组织形式的党的作用日益增强。
    为了完成七年计划，就必须进一步提高党的全部政治思想工作和组织工作水平，积极发挥苏联人民的创造性，必须使所有劳动者都了解计划的各项任务，组织并调动每一个单位的力量来完成这些任务，必须坚决根除缺点，克服工作中所碰到的困难。
    计划的成功将直接取决于企业、建筑工地、集体农庄、国营农场和科学机关。因此要进一步提高地方党机关和基层党组织的作用，它们的使命是动员和组织群众来完成具体的生产任务。党组织必须努力在每个企业、每个集体农庄、国营农场和机关造成一种从事创造性劳动和蓬勃发展的气氛。应当记住，胜利是不会自行到来的，而是需要争取和巩固的。
    党组织、宣传员和鼓动员在号召执行共产主义建设计划时，应该用通俗和明确的方式来说明共产主义是什么和它给人们将带来多么巨大的好处，应该全力支持和发展各种共产主义的劳动形式。党的组织活动和教育活动，党的思想工作的一切手段，都应该促进共产主义建设任务的顺利完成。必须使每个劳动者采用先进的劳动方法，更有效地利用机器、机床、机组、拖拉机、联合机。
    代表大会认为，在实现七年计划方面，党和国家的干部起着头等重要的作用。必须改进配备和培养干部的工作，提拔有素养、具有原则性、对新鲜事物敏感的人去担任领导工作，他们会贡献出全部精力和知识来为人民谋福利，在工作中充满布尔什维克的热情，对缺点毫不妥协。必须更大胆地提拔青年干部，让他们有机会在实际工作中显示自己的才干。
    党组织有责任以熟练干部去加强落后的企业、集体农庄、国营农场和区，选拔那些能够调动巨大潜力的优秀的组织者和专家去组织人们和提高落后的地区。
    党组织的职责就是教育我们的干部、全体共产党员在所担任的工作中，要严格要求自己，要具有高度的责任感，教育他们忠实为人民服务，忠实于共产主义事业。必须不断提高我们干部的理论水平和马克思列宁主义的素养。
    在提高党的组织工作和动员群众解决共产主义建设的任务方面，坚持实行党内民主，展开批评和自我批评这一消灭工作中的缺点和前进的有力工具，具有越来越重要的意义。
    在社会发展的现阶段，劳动人民代表苏维埃的作用更加提高。共和国、边疆区、州、市、区和村苏维埃应当经常研究工业企业、工地、集体农庄和国营农场在完成七年计划的各项任务的工作中的重大问题，关心提高劳动人民的物质福利和文化。苏维埃机关在依靠群众的积极性，进一步扩大社会主义民主，坚决根除因循疲塌和官僚主义因素方面做得越好，它们的工作就越有成效。
    必须对苏联宪法作某些修改和补充。自从通过宪法以来，苏联的政治生活和经济生活发生了重大的变化，国际形势也发生了变化。所有这些变化应当在苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的宪法中得到反映，并以法律形式固定下来。
    在动员广大群众为顺利地完成七年计划而斗争方面，工会组织要进行巨大的工作。工会应当发挥工人阶级和全体劳动人民的积极性，为争取每个企业完成和超额完成国家任务而要广泛地开展社会主义竞赛，支持革新者、发明者、先进生产者，并推广他们的经验。工会必须加强监督生产中的劳动保护、住宅建筑计划的执行、住宅面积的分配、贸易企业和公共饮食业的工作以及服务于劳动人民的医疗事业和公用事业的情况。工会的极重要的任务是开展群众教育工作、改进文化教育机关的工作。
    我们党制订的今后七年的共产主义建设纲领，给青年一代及其先锋队——列宁共产主义青年团的积极性和提高他们的创造性主动性与独立活动的精神开辟了极广阔的天地。共青团员在将来仍然应当是青年的忘我劳动的表率。每个共青团组织都应当成为战斗的、生气勃勃的、同青年保持紧密联系的集体。共青团将积极参加工业、住宅和文化——生活的建设，积极参加进一步发展社会主义农业和开发国内新地区的自然富源的斗争。
    党组织和共青团组织必须特别重视培养青年的共产主义世界观，培养热爱自己祖国、善于按照共产主义方式生活和工作的、积极和自觉的共产主义社会建设者。
    共产党和苏联人民现在的主要任务是：保证无条件地完成发展国民经济的七年计划。实现党和政府提出的今后七年的各项任务对于进一步加强我国的力量将有巨大的意义。苏联发展国民经济七年计划的基本方针是和平发展经济和提高人民福利，完成这个计划将同时更加加强苏联的国防力量，使它有更多的准备，以便对帝国主义侵略者的任何侵犯社会主义伟大果实的行为给予毁灭性的反击。苏联和所有社会主义国家和平经济建设的成就将再一次地表明社会主义比资本主义优越，将更加增大伟大马克思列宁主义思想的吸引力。

    苏联人民在社会主义建设过程中建立了伟大的、全世界公认的劳动功勋。共产党第二十一次代表大会坚决相信，我国社会进入全面展开共产主义建设的时期将激发起汹涌澎湃的劳动热潮，将出现为完成和超额完成七年计划的新的全民竞赛的新形式，将成为最出色的胜利的标志。
    党所拟定的共产主义建设的宏伟纲领在苏联人民面前展开了通向共产主义的广无边际、光辉灿烂的前景。我们的神圣的目标已经不远了。我们将要走过同资本主义进行和平经济竞赛的决定性阶段，在最短期间内在这个竞赛中赢得胜利。我们具有一切必要条件来达到这个境地。当我们解决了这些任务并踏上新天地的时候，我们的前进将更容易了。为了建立起共产主义这一伟大目标，能够而且必须好好地劳动。
    苏联人民同社会主义阵营各国人民在紧密的团结中前进，开辟着走向共产主义的道路。强大的社会主义阵营一天比一天加强。共产主义的思想成为当代的主导力量。
    共产党第二十一次代表大会号召我们伟大祖国的全体劳动人民为完成和超额完成七年计划而积极奋斗。代表大会完全相信，工人、集体农民、苏维埃知识分子将尽一切努力，来进一步加强我们社会主义国家的力量，实现马克思列宁主义胜利旗帜上所描绘出的共产主义理想。
    英雄的苏联人民在共产党的领导下信心百倍地前进，创造着世界上最美好的、最公正的社会——共产主义社会。
