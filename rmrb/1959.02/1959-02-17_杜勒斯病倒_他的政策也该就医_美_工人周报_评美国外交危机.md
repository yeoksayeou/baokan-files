Xinhua News Agency, February 16th, New York dispatch: The American "Worker's Weekly" published an article by Joseph North on the 15th, saying that Dulles is undoubtedly ill, but he also "entered Walter Reed Hospital at a time when his policies also went wrong."

	North's article, entitled "Will Dulles Dictate Policy From His Hospital Bed?" discussed in detail the failure of Eisenhower-Dulles' foreign policy.

	The article said, "Dulles' name has now become a symbol of brinkmanship - pushing the world to the brink of the abyss of war. He just made a lightning visit to Europe when British Prime Minister Macmillan was preparing to visit Moscow. Macmillan's visit is one of the visits that many Western politicians are making or promising to make when elections are approaching… But it's not just to get votes. Undoubtedly, Macmillan's planned visit is not what Washington considers appropriate, nor is it what Adenauer's Bonn and De Gaulle's Paris consider appropriate."

	The article said, "Now there is disunity in the structure of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which has been cracking under internal tensions, and this tension has been greatly exacerbated in recent months by the West German war criminal company threatening British markets and sales. The recent split over the opening and closing of markets in Europe proves this, and it is becoming increasingly clear that the situation is developing in favor of West Germany and to the disadvantage of Britain."

	The article said, "As a result of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the ranks of those in the West who advocate the Cold War (and hot war) have been further disrupted. The results of the Congress have convinced all observers who still retain a bit of objectivity that the socialist countries, led by the Soviet Union, are making new and significant achievements in production and welfare. Moreover, the socialist countries, which account for one-third of the world's population and are striving for world peace, are unshakably united. Tito's position makes it almost impossible for the West to derive any comfort."

	The article said that Dulles' "brinkmanship was also frustrated by Mikoyan's recent visit here (the United States). This visit showed that important sections of the American business community and the general public are concerned about reaching a temporary agreement with the Soviet Union."

	The article said, "There was another factor when Dulles went to the hospital: the calls in Congress for a change in foreign policy are getting higher and louder." The article cited many people, such as Senators Fulbright, Humphrey, and industrialist Eaton, who are now criticizing the Republican government's foreign policy, and the results of the congressional elections last November showed how widespread the opposition to the Dulles-Eisenhower policy was.

	Regarding the Berlin issue, the article said that now there is "a larger section of the European public that is uneasy about the revival of West German military power and the restoration of West German economic power. They see that Alfred Krupp has regained his former position and is now the second largest steel manufacturer in West Germany. The monopolistic steel property is once again in the hands of this man, who was once convicted as a war criminal, and who once helped Hitler's movement with weapons produced by hundreds of thousands of slave laborers. In these circumstances, the Soviet proposals on Berlin touched millions of Europeans, who see this as a good first step towards restoring sanity to the continent and paving the way for the reunification of Germany in a way acceptable to both East and West. Many West Germans are disappointed with Adenauer's stubborn attitude on this issue and are actively considering new solutions."

	The article concluded by saying that this is the situation in which he went to the hospital. The article urged the American public - first and foremost the workers - to take a firm stand, to intervene in American foreign policy, and to force the government to adopt a sound new policy.

### 杜勒斯病倒  他的政策也该就医  美“工人周报”评美国外交危机

    杜勒斯病倒
    他的政策也该就医
    美“工人周报”评美国外交危机
    新华社16日讯　纽约消息：美国“工人周报”15日发表约瑟夫·诺思一篇文章说，杜勒斯无疑是患病了，但是他同时是“在他的政策也出了毛病的时候进入华尔特·里德医院的”。
    诺思这篇题为“杜勒斯会不会从医院的病床上指示政策？”的文章详细地谈到了艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯的外交政策的失败。
    文章说，“杜勒斯的名字现在已经成为边缘政策——把世界推向战争深渊的边缘——的象征。他刚刚在英国首相麦克米伦准备赴莫斯科访问的时候对欧洲进行了闪电式的访问。麦克米伦的访问是许多西方政治家在选举迫近时进行的或者是答应进行的一种访问……但是这还不仅仅是为了取得选票。无疑，麦克米伦的计划中的访问并不是华盛顿认为宜于做的事，也不是阿登纳的波恩和戴高乐的巴黎认为宜于做的事。”
    文章说，“现在在北大西洋公约组织国家的结构中正存在着不团结，这种结构已经在内部的紧张形势下发生裂痕，而这种紧张形势在最近几个月中由于西德战犯公司威胁了英国的市场和销售而大为加剧了。最近在欧洲的开放和关闭市场问题上的分裂证明了这一点，而且情况越来越清楚，局势正在向有利于西德而不利于英国的方向发展。”
    文章说，“由于莫斯科第二十一次党代表大会的结果，西方主张冷战（和热战）的人的阵势进一步被打乱。代表大会的结果使所有仍然抱有一点客观态度的观察家相信，以苏联为首的社会主义各国在生产和福利方面正在取得新的巨大的成就。而且竭力主张世界和平的占世界人口三分之一的社会主义国家是不可动摇地团结一致的。铁托的地位使西方几乎不可能得到什么慰借。”
    文章说，杜勒斯的“边缘政策还因为最近米高扬对这里（美国）的访问而受到挫折。这次访问显示了美国企业界中重要的部分以及普遍的公众关心同苏联取得暂时的协议。”
    文章说，“当杜勒斯进医院时还有另外的因素：国会中要求改变外交政策的呼声越来越高、越来越强烈。”文章举例说，像参议员富布赖特、汉弗莱以及工业家伊顿等许多人现在都在抨击共和党政府的外交政策，而去年11月国会选举的结果表明，杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔政策遭到多么普遍的反对。
    谈到柏林问题，文章说，现在已经有“更大一部分的欧洲公众对于西德军事力量的复活和西德经济力量的恢复感到不安。他们看到，阿尔弗雷德·克虏伯已经恢复昔日的地位，现在成为西德的第二个大钢铁制造商。垄断的钢铁财产重新掌握在这个人手里，这个人曾经被判决为战犯，他曾经以数十万奴隶劳工生产的武器来帮助希特勒的运动。在这些情况下，苏联关于柏林的建议打动了千百万的欧洲人，认为这是使大陆恢复理智并且用东西方都能接受的办法为德国重新统一铺平道路的良好的第一步。许多西德人正在对阿登纳在这个问题上的顽固态度感到失望并且正在积极考虑采取新的解决办法。”
    文章最后说，这就是在这种情况下进医院的。文章敦促美国公众——首先是劳动者采取坚持的态度，对美国外交政策进行干预，迫使政府采取健全的新政策。
