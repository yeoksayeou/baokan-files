    Rectification and Improvement

The news of Hengyang City's vigorous rectification and improvement of local industries has solved an important problem: how can the many new factories that sprung up during the Great Leap Forward achieve an even greater and better Great Leap Forward this year?

The law of progress for things is often like this: large-scale mass movements promote a great leap in production and a great development in undertakings, and great development brings with it some new problems. After a period of rectification, consolidation, and improvement, the problems are solved, and then a path to even greater development is embarked upon. This is true of the people's communes, the small-scale backyard steel furnaces, and local industries are no exception.

One cannot simply look at the advancement and development of certain undertakings from the number of factory units. Last year, Hengyang City newly established more than 230 district-run and street-run factories. This year, based on the supply of raw materials, labor arrangements, and the needs of the state and society, they have been reorganized into 172. If we only look at the number of factory units, it is indeed a reduction compared to the past; however, if we look at the scale of the factories and the production plans, it is obviously an expansion compared to the past. That is to say, after rectification, the quality of local industry has improved.

Another very important point is that the reorganization and improvement of local industries also belongs to the issue of "the whole country as a coordinated chess game." The unified national economic plan is the plan for "the whole country as a coordinated chess game." Although localities and departments have many things that can be done according to local conditions, they must be done under the guidance of the principle of "the whole country as a coordinated chess game." For example, which factories should concentrate their efforts on serving large factories, which factories should undertake repair and maintenance tasks, which factories should prepare machinery and pesticides for agricultural production, and which factories should produce necessary daily necessities – all of these require comprehensive planning, careful deployment, and overall arrangements. Only in this way can our local industries better serve large industries, agriculture, and the people's lives.

### 整顿和提高

    整顿和提高
    衡阳市大力整编和提高地方工业的消息，解决了大跃进中蓬勃发展起来的许多新工厂今年如何更大更好地大跃进的重要问题。
    事物的前进规律常常是这样：大规模的群众运动推动了生产的大跃进和事业的大发展，大发展中又带来了一些新的问题，经过一番整顿巩固和提高，问题解决了，又走上了更大发展的途程。人民公社如此，钢铁小土炉如此，地方工业也不能例外。
    不能单纯从工厂单位数字上去看某些事业的跃进和发展。去年衡阳市新办的区属和街道办的工厂共有二百三十多个，今年根据原材料供应、劳动安排以及国家社会需要等情况整编为一百七十二个。如果仅仅从工厂单位数字去看确实是比过去缩减了；但是，如果从工厂规模、生产计划来看，明显地是比过去扩大了。也就是说，经过整顿，地方工业在质量上提高了。
    还有很重要的一点是，地方工业的整编和提高也是属于全国一盘棋的问题，全国的统一经济计划，也就是全国一盘棋的计划。地方和部门虽然有许多因地制宜的事情可办，但必须在全国一盘棋的方针下去办，如哪些工厂应该集中力量为大厂服务，哪些工厂应该担负起修配任务，哪些工厂为农业生产准备机械和农药，哪些厂生产必要的生活用品，都要有全面规划，周密部署，统筹安排。只有这样，我们的地方工业才能为大工业、农业和人民生活服务得更好。
