    Is There Life Beyond Earth?
  　Shuang Yu
    Our Earth is a planet that breeds life. Are there any other planets in the universe that also harbor life? This is a question that astronomers have been exploring and that people have been concerned about. In particular, the successful launch of Soviet space rockets has brought humanity's dream of interstellar travel closer to reality, which has further aroused people's interest in this question.
    As early as the 16th century, the great Italian scientist and thinker Bruno pointed out that life exists not only on Earth but also on those stars far away from us.
    For life to exist and develop, at a minimum, three conditions must be met: a suitable temperature, water, and air. Now let's talk about whether there is life on other planets based on these three conditions.
            On the Earth's Satellite, the Moon
    The moon is a satellite of our Earth. There is almost no atmosphere or water on the moon. Due to the lack of air, the temperature on the moon varies greatly. During the day on the moon, the temperature can reach 100 to 135 degrees Celsius, while at night it can drop to 160 degrees Celsius below zero. Under the conditions of no air, no water, and such drastic temperature changes, it should be said that life cannot exist. However, some uniquely structured dark spots have been found on the slopes and valleys of the moon, and sometimes those dark spots appear green. Therefore, some astronomers believe that these are plants similar to moss and lichen, while others believe that they are large amounts of microorganisms. However, it is unreasonable to explain the existence of dark spots in this way because the physical conditions on the moon are not suitable for life to exist. Some astronomers believe that the dark spots are micro "frost" formed on the moon due to the cold effect of the long nights.
      On Mars, the Earth's Outer Neighbor
    Mars is our Earth's neighbor, and it resembles Earth more than any other planet. Therefore, people are particularly interested in it. Whether there is life on Mars is a question that people have been debating for over 150 years.
    Mars is much smaller than Earth, but it takes 24 hours, 37 minutes, and 23 seconds to rotate once, which is almost the same as a day on Earth. Mars also has the change of seasons, but each season lasts about twice as long as a season on Earth. The average distance of Mars from the sun is 278 million kilometers, which is much farther than the 150 million kilometers of Earth from the sun. Therefore, it receives less sunlight and heat than Earth, on average about 30% to 50% less. It can be measured that the temperature on the Martian equator around noon is 5 to 30 degrees Celsius, dropping at night and reaching 45 degrees Celsius below zero at dawn; near its poles, the summer temperature is about 6 degrees Celsius. The temperature difference between day and night on Mars is as high as 70 degrees Celsius, and the temperature difference throughout the year is also very large, with its winter dropping to 80 degrees Celsius below zero. Therefore, generally speaking, the climate on Mars is much colder than on Earth.
    Mars also has an atmosphere. Furthermore, water vapor and oxygen spectral lines can be found in the Martian spectrum. However, according to calculations, the oxygen content per unit surface area of Mars is only 15% of the normal oxygen content in the Earth's atmosphere, and the water vapor is only 5% of that on Earth. In addition, Mars has twice as much carbon dioxide as Earth. The atmospheric density on the surface of Mars is very small, only equivalent to the atmospheric density at an altitude of 15 kilometers above sea level on Earth.
    Through a telescope, we can see that near the poles of Mars are white, hat-shaped objects, which scientists call "polar caps." The polar caps change with the seasons. They become larger in the Martian polar winter and smaller in the summer. It can be assumed that the polar caps are mainly composed of ice. From the existence of the polar caps, we can know that not only is there moisture in the atmosphere of Mars, but there is also moisture on its surface.
    Based on the above physical conditions, Mars can nurture life. Soviet astronomers Tikhov and Barabashov have proven through years of research that life does indeed exist on Mars.
    From the telescope, it can be seen that most of Mars is orange-yellow, which is the desert covered with iron oxide; another part appears as blue-green spots, which scientists call the "seas" on Mars. Like the polar caps, the color of those spots also changes with the Martian seasons. In summer, they emit a green luster, and in autumn, they turn brown. Is this a scene of Martian plants changing with the changes in surface conditions?
    Mars is much colder than Earth. If we study the plants in the high-altitude and frigid zones of the Earth, we can infer the situation of plants on Mars. Tikhov and his students used spectral analysis to study the properties of many plants growing in the high mountains and arctic regions of the Earth, and then compared them with the spectral observation data of spots on Mars. The results confirmed that the above-mentioned "seas" on Mars are indeed relatively humid areas covered by plants. Tikhov believes that life has a very strong adaptability to the environment, and Martian plants should also have the ability to maintain their lives under the conditions of lack of water and air and severe cold.
    Where there are plants, there may also be animals, so there may be animals on Mars. Of course, the animal kingdom on Mars should also be like our animal kingdom on Earth, requiring tens of millions of years to adapt to the physical conditions on Mars.
    Even so, the assertion that there is life on Mars cannot be confirmed yet, because some scientists have raised opposing opinions.
          On Venus, the Earth's Inner Neighbor
    Venus is an average of 108 million kilometers from the sun, closer to the sun than Earth. The sunlight and heat it receives are about twice that of Earth, so the temperature on its surface is much higher than on Earth. It is about 100 degrees Celsius during the day and can drop to 25 degrees Celsius below zero at night. Venus also has a thick atmosphere around it, but it contains a particularly large amount of carbon dioxide, while the content of oxygen and water is extremely small. Some people believe that the physical conditions on Venus are equivalent to those of the Earth in the distant past—the early Carboniferous period. However, regarding the atmospheric composition of Venus, what we see is only its uppermost layer, not the surface of Venus. Venus may also have the oxygen and water necessary for life. Furthermore, Tikhov believes that based on the currently known physical conditions of Venus, plants may exist on Venus. He also inferred that the plants on Venus are yellow, orange, or red. However, whether there is life on Venus and whether it can be regarded as the Earth in the distant past remains to be proven in the future.
            On Other Planets in the Solar System
    Mercury, the closest to the sun, takes the same amount of time to rotate once as it does to orbit the sun, so it always faces the sun with one side, which has a temperature of 412 degrees Celsius; while the other side is always a cold and long night, with a minimum temperature of 200 degrees Celsius below zero. Mercury is much smaller than Earth, and the gravity on its surface is only about 39% of Earth's, so it cannot maintain an atmosphere that is easily visible to us. From these physical conditions, it is impossible for life to exist on Mercury.
    Some of the giant planets in the solar system—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are all far from the sun, so their temperatures are very low, about 140 to 220 degrees Celsius below zero. Their atmospheres are basically composed of ammonia, methane, and hydrogen. Methane is produced by the decay of organic matter, and what causes the decay of organic matter is the reproduction of bacteria. Therefore, the presence of methane on the giant planets proves the activity of bacteria. According to observations, the spectrum of methane on these planets is indeed the same as the spectrum of methane produced during the decay of organic matter. Ammonia, like methane, can also be produced from the decay of various organic remains. It can be assumed that ammonia and methane are formed by the decomposition of dead microorganisms deep in the atmosphere of these giant planets. Therefore, we can speculate that bacteria exist on these giant planets.
    As for Pluto, the farthest planet from the sun, because it is very small, with a diameter of only 5,870 kilometers, and very far from our Earth, we know very little about its situation, and it is currently impossible to judge whether there is life on it.
        In Other Stellar Worlds
    On every clear night, countless stars shine in the sky. Like the sun, they are celestial bodies that emit their own light and heat, which are what we call stars. Some stars come in pairs, which are called binary stars; some come in groups of three or five, which are called star clusters. Stars, binary stars, and star clusters, including our solar system, all belong to the Milky Way galaxy. There are about 150 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy. In the Milky Way galaxy, there are other planetary systems besides our solar system. As of the beginning of 1953, astronomers had discovered the existence of planetary systems around seventeen stars. There are countless such planetary systems in the universe. Of course, among the countless planetary systems, there will be many planets with life.
    Soviet scientists Oparin and Fesenkov recently made inferences about the number of planets with life in the Milky Way galaxy. They believe that the orbits of planets with life should be close to circular, because if the orbit of a planet is a very flat ellipse, then the planet will be sometimes very far from and sometimes very close to the "sun" (the "primary star" in the planetary system), and the climate change will be very severe, which is not conducive to the survival of life. Due to the attractive relationship between celestial bodies, the orbits of planets in binary stars and star clusters cannot be circular. 80% of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy are binary stars and star clusters. Therefore, it is impossible for life to exist on most celestial bodies in the Milky Way galaxy. There are also some celestial bodies in the Milky Way galaxy whose brightness changes frequently. These are variable stars and novae. Their brightness changes frequently, which is harmful to the survival of life. Therefore, it is also impossible for life to exist on the planets around variable stars and novae. From the perspective of celestial evolution, the age of a star (primary star) should be greater than the age of a planet, and the age of a planet should be greater than the age required in the history of life development; since the development of life generally requires billions of years (the Earth's age is about five billion years), it is also impossible for life to exist on young celestial bodies. The mass of a planet with life should not be too large or too small. This is because if the mass is too large, the gravity on the planet will also be large, which is not conducive to the survival of organisms; if the mass is too small, the gravity will also be small, and the air on the planet will easily escape, which will also hinder the survival of life. In addition, a planet with life cannot be too far from its "sun," otherwise it will not be able to maintain a suitable temperature. Oparin and Fesenkov considered these factors, made some statistical calculations, and believed that the greatest probability of life existing around stars in the Milky Way galaxy is about one in 100,000 to one in a million. That is to say, around one in 100,000 to one million stars, the planets may have life, that is, about 150,000 to 1.5 million planets in the Milky Way galaxy may have life.
    Our Milky Way galaxy is just a small island in the universe. There are countless Milky Way galaxies like ours, composed of hundreds of billions of stars. Therefore, we can say with certainty that life does not only exist on our Earth. On some planets around other distant stars, not only is there ordinary life, but there may also be rational beings.
        Space Rockets and the Question of Life on Planets
    Whether there is life on other celestial bodies is a question that has not yet been resolved. The successful launch of space rockets will help us take a big step forward in solving this problem. For example, as mentioned above, some people think that the dark spots "seas" on Mars are not plants. Since Venus has a thick atmosphere, we don't know anything about the surface conditions of Venus. We can launch a space rocket through the Martian region to directly obtain some scientific investigation data. We can also launch a rocket equipped with television equipment to orbit Mars and directly observe the life activities on Mars. In the future, we can also take rockets to Mars and Venus for on-site exploration. We can even fly farther, visit other planetary systems.

    地球以外存在生命吗？
  　双鱼
    我们的地球是个繁殖生命的天体，宇宙间存在着无数个天体，在其他的天体上是不是也有生命存在呢？这是天文学家一直在探索的问题，也是人们一直在关心的问题。特别是苏联发射宇宙火箭的成功，使人类实现星际航行的理想接近实现，这就更引起了人们对这个问题的兴趣。
    远在十六世纪，伟大的意大利科学家和思想家布鲁诺就曾经指出，生命不单存在于地球上面，也存在于那些离我们遥远的星星上。
    要生命生存、发展，最低限度必需三个条件：要有适宜的温度；要有水；要有空气。现在让我们根据这三个条件来谈谈别的星球上有没有生命的问题。
            在地球的卫星月亮上
    月亮是我们地球的卫星。月亮上几乎没有大气和水分。由于没有空气，月亮上的温度变化很大。在月球上，白天的温度可以达到摄氏一百度到一百三十五度，而晚上的温度却可以降到摄氏零下一百六十度。在没有空气、水分而温度变化这样厉害的情况下，应该说生命是不能存在的。但是，后来在月亮的山坡上和山谷中发现了一些有特殊构造的黑斑，有时那些黑斑又呈现绿的颜色。因此，有的天文学家就认为那是一些类似青苔和地衣的植物，也有的天文学家认为那是大量的微生物。可是，这样来解释黑斑的存在是不合理的，因为月球上的物理条件是不适合于生命存在的。有的天文学家认为，黑斑是月球上由于漫长之夜的寒冷作用而形成的微“霜”。
      在地球的外邻居火星上
    火星是我们地球的邻居，它比别的行星更像地球。因此，人们对它特别感到兴趣。火星上有无生命，这是人们已经争论了一百五十年以上的问题。
    火星比地球小得多，但是它自转一周的时间是二十四时三十七分二十三秒，和地球的一天差不多。火星上也有四季的变化，不过每一季的日子比地球上的一季约长一倍。火星到太阳的平均距离是二亿七千八百万公里，比地球离太阳的一亿五千万公里要远得多，因此它得到的太阳光和热比地球得到的也少得多，平均约少30％到50％。可以测出，在火星赤道上正午前后的温度是摄氏五度到三十度，夜间则下降，到黎明时会降低到摄氏零下四十五度；在它的两极附近，夏天的温度约为摄氏六度。火星上不仅昼夜的温度差有七十度之多，一年间的温差也很大，它的冬季会降到摄氏零下八十度。因此，一般说来，火星上的气候比地球上要冷得多。
    火星上也有大气。并且，在火星的光谱线中，可以找到水汽和氧的光谱线。但是，根据计算，火星每单位表面上氧的含量只有地球大气里氧的正常含量的15％，水汽只有地球上的5％。此外，火星上有比地球上多一倍的二氧化碳。火星表面上的大气密度很小，只相当于地球海平面上十五公里高处的大气密度。
    用望远镜可以看到，火星两极附近有着白色帽子状的东西，科学家们把它叫做“极冠”。极冠是随季节的变化而变化的。到了火星极地冬季它就变大，到了夏季它又缩小。可以设想，极冠主要是冰块组成的。从极冠的存在，我们可以知道，火星上不仅大气中有水分，它的表面上也有水分。
    根据上述物理条件，火星是可以孕育生命的。苏联天文学家吉霍夫和巴拉巴雪夫经过多年的研究都证明，火星上的确有生命存在的。
    从望远镜里可以看到，火星大部分是橙黄色的，那就是复盖着氧化铁的沙漠；另外有一部分呈青蓝色的斑点，科学家们把它叫做火星上的“海”。那些斑点的颜色同极冠一样，也是随着火星上的季节而变化，夏季它们放出绿色的光彩，到了秋季它们就变成褐色。这是不是火星上的植物随着表面上的条件的变化而变化的情景呢？
    火星上比地球上冷得多，如果我们研究了地球上高寒地带的植物，就可以推知火星上的植物的情况。吉霍夫和他的学生们用光谱分析法研究了许多生长在地球高山上和北极地区的植物的性质，然后把它们同火星上关于斑点的光谱观测资料比较，结果证实上述火星上的“海”的确是被植物复盖着的比较潮湿的地区。吉霍夫认为，生命对于环境是有着极强的适应能力的，火星上的植物也应该具有缺少水和空气而且严寒的条件下保持其生命的能力。
    有植物的地方，也可能有动物，所以火星上是可能有动物的。当然，火星上的动物界也应该像我们地球上的动物界一样，要有几千万年才能适应火星上的物理条件。
    虽然这样，火星上有生命的论断，至今还不能肯定，因为有的科学家又提出了相反的意见。
          在地球的内邻居金星上
    金星离太阳平均一亿零八百万公里，比地球离太阳近。它得到的太阳光和热，约等于地球得到的两倍，所以它表面的温度比地球上要高得多。白天约为摄氏一百度，夜里可以降到摄氏零下二十五度。金星的周围也有一层浓厚的大气，可是其中碳酸气特别多，而氧和水分的含量极微。有人认为，金星上的物理情况相当于远古时代——石炭初纪的地球的情况。不过，关于金星的大气成分，我们所看到的只是它的最上层的，而不是金星表面的。金星上也可能有着生命所必需的氧和水。并且吉霍夫认为，根据目前已知的金星的物理条件，金星上是可能有植物存在的。他还推断，金星上的植物是黄色、橙色或红色的。但是，究竟金星上有无生命，能不能把它看成远古时代的地球，这要等待以后证明。
            在太阳系其他行星上
    离太阳最近的水星，它自转一周的时间等于它围绕太阳走一圈的时候，所以它总是一面朝太阳，温度高达摄氏四百十二度；而另一面则永远是阴冷的漫漫长夜，最低温度到摄氏零下二百度。水星比地球小得多，它表面的重力只约等于地球的39％，所以它不能保持容易被我们看见的大气。从这些物理情况来看，水星上是不可能有生命存在的。
    太阳系中一些巨大的行星——木星、土星、天王星和海王星，都是远离太阳的，所以它们的温度都很低，约在摄氏零下一百四十度到二百二十度之间。它们的大气层基本上是由氨、沼气和氢气组成的。沼气是从有机物质腐败而产生的，而引起有机物质腐败的是细菌的繁殖，因此，大行星上有沼气存在就证明有细菌的活动。根据观测，这些行星上的沼气的光谱确实同有机物质腐败时产生的沼气的光谱相同。氨气和沼气一样，也可以从各种有机体遗骸腐败的时候产生。可以设想，氨和沼气都是这些大行星的大气深处由于衰亡的微生物分解而成。因此，我们可以推测，在这些大行星上有细菌存在。
    至于离太阳最远的冥王星，因为它很小，直径只五千八百七十公里，又离我们地球很远，所以我们对它的情况了解得很少，目前还无法判断它上面有无生命存在。
        在别的恒星世界上
    在每个晴朗的夜晚，天空闪耀着无数的星星。它们都像太阳一样，是自己发光发热的天体，那就是我们说的恒星。恒星有的成双成对，这叫做双星；有的三五成群，这叫做聚星。恒星、双星和聚星等，包括我们太阳系在内，都是属于银河系的。在银河系里，约有一千五百亿颗恒星。在银河系里，除我们太阳系外，还有别的行星系。到1953年初止，天文学家已经在十七颗恒星的周围发现了类似行星系的存在。在宇宙中，这种行星系是无数的。在无数的行星系中当然会有不少有生命存在的行星。
    苏联科学家奥巴林和费森柯夫最近对银河系内有生命存在的行星的数量作了推论。他们认为有生命存在的行星的轨道应该是近于圆形的，因为如果行星的轨道是非常扁的椭圆形的，那末行星离“太阳”（行星系中的“主星”）就有时很远有时很近，气候变化就很厉害，这对生命的生存是不利的。由于星体间具有吸引力的关系，双星和聚星中的行星轨道不可能是圆形的。在银河系中有80％是双星和聚星，因此，在银河系中绝大部分星体是不可能存在生命的。在银河系中还有一些亮度经常变化的星体，这就是变星和新星。它们的亮度经常变化，这对生命的生存是有害的，因此，变星和新星的周围的行星上也不可能存在生命。从天体演化的角度来看，恒星（主星）的年龄应该大于行星的年龄，并且行星的年龄应该大于生命发展史上所需要的年龄；由于生命的发展一般需要是几十亿年（地球年龄约五十亿年），所以年轻的星体也不可能存在生命。有生命存在的行星的质量不应该太大，也不应该太小。这是因为质量太大，行星上的重力也大，这对有机体生存是不利的；质量太小，重力也小，行星上的空气就易跑掉，这也有碍于生命的生存。此外，有生命存在的行星不能离它的“太阳”太远，否则它就不可能保持适当的温度。奥巴林和费森柯夫考虑了这些因素，作了一些统计计算，认为银河系内恒星周围生命存在的最大的几率约十万分之一到百万分之一。这就是说，在十万颗到一百万颗恒星中，有一颗恒星的周围的行星可能有生命存在，即银河系中约有十五万颗到一百五十万颗行星可能有生命存在。
    我们的银河系只是宇宙的一个小岛，像我们这样由千百亿颗恒星组成的银河系还有无数个。因此，我们可以肯定地说，生命不只存在于我们的地球上。在其他遥远的恒星周围的某些行星上，不仅有普通的生命存在，并且可能有理性的生物存在。
        宇宙火箭与星球上生命问题
    别的天体有无生命，这是一个现在还没有解决的问题，宇宙火箭发射成功，将帮助我们在解决这个问题方面迈进了一大步。例如，上面已经谈过，火星上的暗斑“海”，有人就认为它们不是植物。由于金星上有着一层浓厚的大气，我们对金星表面的情况根本不清楚。我们可以发射一个宇宙火箭经过火星区域，直接获取一些科学考察资料。我们也可以发射一个装有电视设备的火箭围绕火星运转，直接观察火星上的生命活动情况。将来，我们还可以坐上火箭到火星和金星上去进行实地探测。甚至我们还可以飞得更遥远，飞到别的行星系去作客。
