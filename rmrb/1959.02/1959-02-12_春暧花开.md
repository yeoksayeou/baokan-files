In the socialist east wind, Guo Moruo sees spring warmth and flowers blooming again. The enemy is rotting away day by day, and we are getting better. 1959 must surpass 1958! The victorious east wind must gradually blow all over the world! The spring of 1959 should be ten times the spring; this year we will welcome the tenth anniversary of the construction of our motherland. Look, everyone is exerting ten times the effort, and every industry hopes to have a gift rocket launched into the sky. Can it be done? We answer affirmatively: It must be done! First of all, we have the Party's centralized and comprehensive leadership. More than 12 million Party members, unafraid of difficulties or trivialities, are setting an example on various fronts! The Party's specific leadership explains the problems in great detail, uniting the hearts of 650 million people as one. It mobilizes the latent power of 650 million people to consolidate the people's commune as the basic unit of communism. The Party's wise call is as bright as the spring sun, calling on people to dare to do and dare to think on the basis of experimentation. It calls on people to combine revolutionary enthusiasm and scientific spirit, to be self-reliant, to be realistic, and to strive to develop originality! The Party's concern is even ten times warmer than the spring breeze, calling on people to ensure they get enough sleep and eat enough. It calls on people to combine rest and labor rhythmically, to learn in labor and to exercise in labor. Six hundred and fifty million people must be trained to become all-rounders, able to work in industry, agriculture, commerce, study, and the military; any road is possible. Of course, everyone should do their best, according to their aptitudes, becoming both red and expert, and everyone should achieve something in their profession. Look, we also have the socialist peace camp, and brotherly countries headed by the Soviet Union are thriving. The Soviet Union's artificial sun planet is rotating in the universe, broadening people's minds and calling for interstellar travel. People liberated under the banner of communism not only control their own destiny, but also control the universe! We assist each other, learn from each other, and promote each other, selflessly, resolutely opposing aggression and defending peace.

The enemy is rotting away day by day, and we are getting better. In the socialist east wind, we see spring warmth and flowers blooming again. Look, aren't the struggles of the people of Africa and Latin America, the angry tide of striving for national independence, as vast as the sea? Nature and all mankind are giving us encouragement. We must let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and cheer to the motherland: Dear motherland, your natural conditions are so rich, we will build you into a paradise on earth, a riot of color! We will dedicate ourselves to you, dedicate ourselves to the Party's noble cause, and 650 million people will exert ten times the effort! We want to make 1959 surpass 1958, first of all to ensure a steel output of 18 million tons. We want to overfulfill the industrial and agricultural targets, and we want to release satellites in science and literature as much as possible. Under the leadership of the Party, 650 million people must ensure: 1959 will make a greater and faster leap forward! Can it be done? We answer affirmatively: It must be done! We must obey the Party's command and make a big splash in the national coordination; we must also strengthen socialist and nationalist cooperation, and we must ensure that the victorious east wind forever overwhelms the west wind!

    春暧花开
    郭沫若在社会主义的东风中，又看到春暖花开，敌人一天天的在烂下去，我们在好起来。一九五九年一定要胜过一九五八年呵，胜利的东风一定要逐步地吹遍全世界！一九五九年的春天应该是十倍的春天，今年我们要迎接到祖国建设的十周年。请看呵，每一个人都在十倍地鼓足干劲，每行每业都希望能够有献礼火箭上天。办得到吗？我们肯定地回答：一定办得到！首先是我们有党的集中的全面的领导，一千二百多万党员不怕艰难不怕烦剧，正以身作则地在各个战线上分道扬镳！党的具体领导把问题阐发得十分详尽，它把六亿五千万人民的心结成一条心。调动了六亿五千万人民的潜在的力量，要巩固人民公社作为共产主义的基层。党的英明号召明朗地就像春天的太阳，它叫人们要在实验的基础上敢做，敢想。它叫人们把革命热情和科学精神结合，自力更生地，实事求是地，努力发扬独创！党的关心更和春风一样十倍地温暖呵，它叫人们要能够保证到睡好觉吃饱饭。它叫人们要有节奏地结合休息和劳动，既要在劳动中学习，也要在劳动中锻炼。六亿五千万人民都要锻炼成为多面手，亦工亦农亦商亦学亦兵，是路都可以走。当然呵，总要各尽所能，各就气质之所近，红透专深，每人在专业上都要有所成就。请看呵，我们还有社会主义的和平阵营，以苏联为首的兄弟国家都在欣欣向荣。苏联的人造太阳行星已在宇宙中旋转，它开拓着人们的心胸，号召着星际旅行。在共产主义旗帜下得到了解放的人民，不仅掌握了自己的命运，并掌握着乾坤！我们在相互协助，相互学习，并相互策进，大公无私地，坚决地，反对侵略，保卫和平。敌人一天天的在烂下去，我们在好起来，在社会主义的东风中又看到春暖花开。请看，非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的战斗，争取民族独立的怒潮岂不是汪洋如海？大自然和全人类都在给予我们以鼓舞，我们要百花齐放、百家争鸣，向祖国欢呼：亲爱的祖国呵，你的自然条件多么丰富，我们要把你建设成地上乐园，花团锦簇！我们要为你献身，为党的崇高事业献身，六亿五千万人民都要十倍地鼓足干劲！我们要使一九五九年胜过一九五八年，首先要保证钢铁产量的一千八百万吨。我们要使工业和农业的指标超额完成，我们要使科学和文艺尽可能放出卫星。六亿五千万人民在党的领导下要保证：一九五九年要作出更大的更快的跃进！办得到吗？我们肯定地回答：一定办得到！我们要听从党的指挥，大闹全国的协调；还要加强社会主义和民族主义的协作，一定要使胜利的东风永远把西风压倒！
