Deep as the Sea
    — A Record of a Naval Unit Rescuing Fishermen at Sea
    Wu Tiemin Qiao Songxin Wei Aimin
    On the afternoon of December 25, 1958, the northwest wind suddenly increased from level three to level eight or higher. Sea spray towered into the sky, and everywhere was a white expanse of raging waves.
    The operations duty room of a certain base received a report: More than 30 fishing boats operating in the Shengshan fishing grounds, due to the ebbing tide and facing the wind and waves, had some masts broken by the wind and waves, and some rudders were taken away by the raging waves, gradually drifting towards the open sea. Hu Miandi, a senior colonel of a certain naval unit, read the report, immediately summoned several officers, gave them the task, and said decisively: "Not a single fisherman can be lost. Remember, we are the people's army!"
    A thrilling sea battle began.
    The sailors of the 618 ship were the first to overcome the raging waves and rescued thirteen fishermen near Langgang.
    The 611艇 (Type 6611 patrol boat) also received the order to sail out to rescue fishermen. The wind far exceeded the boat's wind resistance. The small boat was like a water polo, sometimes lifted to the crest of a wave, and sometimes thrown into the deep trough of a wave. The sea water hit people's faces and bodies like countless sharp needles, causing a numb and painful sensation all over. The boat had tilted to forty-seven degrees. Those who lived on the ocean knew that the boat was in a very dangerous situation.艇长 (Boat Captain) Wen Guiyou and 副艇长 (Deputy Boat Captain) Jia Benyu looked at each other and decided to compete with the sea for the lives of the fishermen brothers. As long as the engine did not fail, they would not return without rescuing the fishermen. At this time, Wen Guiyou discovered three fishing boats drifting towards the open sea in the northeast direction through his binoculars and immediately ordered to accelerate towards the open sea. The wind and waves became even greater. Even those who were not usually seasick vomited yellow bile. But no one left their battle post. Telegraph operator Liu Shouye was at sea for the first time, and his face was waxy yellow because of excessive vomiting. But he was still lying on his side, holding the handrail with his left hand, and moving the telegraph key with his right hand, contacting the base. When he could no longer hold on and his right hand gradually drooped, a strong arm supported him: "Xiao Liu, hold on!" It was the deputy boat captain. He fell into the arms of the deputy boat captain. How thirsty he was, how nice it would be to have a cup of cold tea. Suddenly, a sweet and crisp candied pineapple was stuffed into his mouth. It was sent by the cook Shen Longchang. Xiao Liu suddenly felt full of energy, turned over and sat up and continued to send the telegraph.
    The small boat passed through layers of wave mountains and gradually approached the fishing boat. The fishermen on the boat were already exhausted, holding the rudder and lying on the deck covered with sea water. When they saw the small boat, they shouted desperately. Wen Guiyou got into the cockpit, personally took the helm, and approached the fishing boat. Gunner Zheng Shuijiu threw a life buoy tied with a steel cable into the sea, drifting towards the fishing boat. The fishermen were saved.
    The 611艇 towed two fishing boats, and was about to approach the third fishing boat when a huge wave, higher than the mast, hit hard. The people on the deck involuntarily slid to the starboard side, sometimes their legs were submerged in the sea, and only by grabbing the bollards with both hands could they avoid falling into the sea. When the small boat approached the fishing boat, the sound of the propeller idling was heard from the engine room. Not only did the boat not move forward, but it was gradually rolled towards the open ocean. Everyone was anxiously sweating. An old fisherman anxiously shouted: "Navy comrades, this won't work, untie one of the fishing boats!" Captain Wen hurriedly shouted: "Can't untie it! Even if there are a few more boats, we have to tow them! We must be tightly connected together!" The sailors said passionately: "Yes, we must be tightly connected together!" Suddenly, with a "bang", a four-inch thick steel cable was broken. In an instant, the boat was lifted into the air by the huge wave, and the broken cable wrapped around the idling propeller, and the main shaft also dislocated. The 611艇 lost its ability to move forward and shook violently.
    The boat captain ordered to immediately drop both anchors to troubleshoot the problem. Both anchors were dropped, but the other tied fishing boat was blown to leeward by the wind and waves. Losing its self-control, the 611艇 was dragged and suddenly tilted to sixty degrees, and a cross wave slammed in, threatening to capsize. The fishermen on the boat greeted nervously while untying the cable. When the boat captain stopped them, the steel cable tying the fishing boat had already been untied.
    The sailors watched the fishing boat gradually drift away, feeling very anxious. At this time, the boat captain ordered signal soldier Liu Zhouju to lookout for the fishing boat on the deck, and the others went into the cabin to help repair the engine.
    A night passed, and the wind and waves still did not weaken. The 611艇 and the three fishing boats drifted uncontrollably towards the open sea.
    After the base learned of the critical situation of the 611艇 and the three fishing boats, it sent more than ten ships and planes to rescue them one after another. When the 611艇 saw the warships coming to rescue, the boat captain immediately ordered the signal soldier to send a signal requesting that the fishing boats be rescued first. The fishing boats were saved. The 611艇 also gloriously returned to the base.

    情深似海
    ——海军某部海上抢救渔民记
    吴铁民  乔颂新  魏艾民
    1958年12月25日下午，西北风由三级骤增到八级以上。海面上掀起了冲天的浪柱，到处是白花花的怒涛。
    某基地作战值班室接到报告：在嵊山渔场作业的三十余艘渔船，因为赶上退潮，迎风顶浪，有的被风浪折断了桅杆，有的被怒涛夺去了船舵，渐渐飘向外海。海军某部首长胡绵第大校看了报告，立即召来几个军官，向他们交代了任务，并斩钉截铁地说：“不能丢掉一个渔民，记住，我们是人民的军队！”
    一场惊险的海上搏斗开始了。
    六一八舰的水兵们首先战胜惊涛骇浪，在浪岗附近救起了十三个渔民。
    六一一艇也接到了出航救渔民的命令。大风远远超过了艇的抗风力。小艇像只水球，一忽儿被举到浪尖，一忽儿又被扔到深深的浪谷。海水打在人的脸上、身上，像无数尖细的针刺，刺的浑身麻煞煞地疼。艇已摆到四十七度，生活在海洋上的人知道，艇的处境十分危险。艇长文桂友和副艇长贾本玉对望了一下，决定和大海争夺渔民兄弟的生命。只要机器不发生故障，救不回渔民不返航。这时，文桂友从望远镜里发现东北方向有三条渔船正向外海漂泊，立即命令加速驶向外海。风浪更大了。一向不晕船的人也吐出了黄水。但是没有一个人离开战斗岗位。报务员刘守业初次出海，因为呕吐过多，脸色蜡黄。但他仍侧卧着，左手抓住扶手，右手打动电键，和基地联系。当他实在支持不住，右手渐渐下垂的时候，一只有力的胳膊托住了他：“小刘，坚持点！”这是副艇长。他一头倒在副艇长的怀里。口多渴呀，如有一杯冷茶该多好。突然，一块又甜又脆的蜜饯菠萝塞到他嘴里。这是炊事员沈龙昌送来的。小刘突然觉得浑身是劲，翻身坐起来继续打着电键。
    小艇穿过层层浪山，逐渐接近了渔船。船上的渔民早已精疲力尽，抓着舵杆，躺在漫着海水的舱面上。当他们看到小艇时就拼命地呼喊起来，文桂友钻进驾驶室，亲自掌舵，向渔船靠近。枪炮兵郑水久用救生圈系着钢缆抛入大海，漂向渔船。渔民得救了。
    六一一艇拖上了两条渔船，正想靠近第三条渔船时，一个比桅杆还要高的大浪狠狠地打来，甲板上的人身不由主地向右舷滑来，有时双腿没入海内，只是两手死抓住系柱，才没有掉下海去。当小艇接近渔船时，从机舱里发出推进器打空车时的响声。艇不但没有前进分寸，反而被渐渐地卷向外洋。每个人都焦急得脸上冒出豆大的汗。一位老渔民着急地喊：“海军同志，这样不行啊，解掉一只渔船吧！”文艇长急忙喊道：“不能解！就是再多几条船也要拖！要紧紧地连在一起！”水兵们激昂地说：“对，要紧紧地连在一起！”突然，“砰”的一声，一根四寸粗的钢缆被拉断了。刹那间，艇身被巨浪掀向高空，断缆一下子缠住了打着空转的推进器，主轴也脱节了。六一一艇失去了前进的能力，剧烈地晃荡起来。
    艇长命令立即沉下双锚排除故障。双锚沉下了，可是另一条系着的渔船被风浪刮到左下风去。失去自制力的六一一艇被拖着一下子倾侧到六十度，横浪拦腰扑来，眼看有复没的危险。船上的渔民一面紧张地打着招呼，一面动手解缆，艇长制止时，系渔船的钢缆已经解脱了。
    水兵们眼看着渔船渐渐飘远，心中十分着急。这时，艇长命令信号兵刘周聚在舱面了望渔船，其他人进舱帮助抢修机器。
    一夜过去了，风浪仍然没有减弱，六一一艇和三条渔船毫无控制地向外海飘去。
    基地得知了六一一艇和三条渔船垂危的消息，先后派出了十多艘舰艇和飞机去抢救。当六一一艇看到前来抢救的军舰时，艇长马上命令信号兵发出了要求先去抢救渔船的信号。渔船得救了。六一一艇也光荣地回到了基地。
