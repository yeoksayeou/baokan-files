Singing and Dancing to Welcome the New Spring
The Spring Festival is approaching, and this is the first Spring Festival for the vast rural areas after the realization of the people's communes. The countryside is showing a more lively pre-holiday scene earlier than in previous years. While the commune members are stepping up their efforts to accumulate fertilizer and prepare for farming, they are also actively rehearsing plays and dances, preparing various entertainment programs. During this joyous festival, they will celebrate the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958 with joy and excitement, and will gather even greater enthusiasm to strive for a greater leap forward in 1959.
