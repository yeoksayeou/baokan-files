    Beijing Launches First Industrial Production Upsurge of the Year
    Plan to Complete First Ten Days' Target in Seven Days

    (Our Dispatch) Beijing industrial workers, on the eve of the Spring Festival (February 7th), completed the production plan for the first ten days of February with an outstanding achievement of exceeding the target by 12.7%. The actual output value completed in the first ten days accounted for 29.1% of the entire month's plan for February. The average daily output value of this period increased by 6.8% compared to the average daily output value in January.
    Following the overfulfillment of the January plan, Beijing's industrial sector swiftly and victoriously completed the plan for the first ten days of February ahead of schedule. This indicates that the first upsurge of the mass movement on Beijing's industrial front this year is rapidly forming and developing vigorously.

          The Upsurge Came Early and Fiercely

    The first characteristic of this upsurge is that it came early and fiercely. Starting in late January, it swept across the city within a few days, from large enterprises like the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company to many district-level medium and small factories and handicraft production cooperatives, all launching a vigorous mass movement. The reason this upsurge came so early and fiercely is, on the one hand, that since before the New Year, various enterprises studied the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and the slogan of achieving a greater leap forward this year was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and a series of preparations were made for this year's production. On the other hand, after a year of glorious battles last year, enterprise leading cadres and the masses have gained rich experience in the Great Leap Forward, and high speed has become a habit for many people. Therefore, when the Municipal Party Committee held a meeting to deploy the work in late January, the movement quickly entered a high tide.

    Comprehensive Leap Forward in Output, Quality, Variety, and Cost
    From the beginning of the movement, attention was paid to the comprehensive leap forward of various indicators such as output, quality, variety, and cost. Many enterprises not only paid attention to the continuous leap forward in output value and output, but also, in the spirit of a comprehensive leap forward, put forward clear slogans based on the key links in their current production. For example, the workers of Beijing No. 1, 2, and 3 Cotton Textile Factories greatly improved product quality while completing their output plans. The consumption of caustic soda in the Machine Weaving and Dyeing Factory was greatly reduced due to large-scale conservation and recycling.

    Combining Mass Movement with Detailed Management Work
    Combining mass movement with detailed management work is another characteristic of this upsurge. Many enterprises, while launching a vigorous mass movement, paid attention to strengthening management work. In order to enable employees to understand the production progress in their minds, the Guanghua Wood Factory formulated daily operation plans for the factory, workshops, teams, and individuals, checked once a day, summarized once a day, and announced once a day. On February 1, the Second Workshop and the Drying Room of this factory only completed 91% of the daily operation plan. After this situation was announced the next day, the workers were very anxious and immediately took many measures to improve production, and finally overfulfilled the daily operation plan with an excellent result of 173.3%.

  The Thrust of the Movement Points to Technological Revolution and Improvement of Labor Organization
    Another characteristic of this upsurge is that, from the beginning, the thrust of the mass movement in many enterprises was directed towards technological revolution and the improvement of labor organization, combining hard work with smart work. The Beijing Chemical Factory completed 45.4% of its monthly plan in the first six days of February due to the adoption of a series of technical and organizational measures. The sixth group of the first workshop of this factory produced tributyl phosphate, which could not be produced in large quantities due to irritating smoke. This time, the workers modified the three idle large reaction tanks in the group to enclose the synthesis reaction of this product in the tanks. This not only solved the problem of operational safety, but also increased the output of this product more than tenfold at once. The Zhunji group in the third workshop of this factory had few old workers and many new workers. They adjusted the labor organization, divided into several combat groups with old workers as the backbone, and simultaneously produced several products in rotation, resulting in a significant increase in production efficiency.
    The competition form of "high-yield day" created by the workers of Beijing in the Great Leap Forward last year has been further developed this year: First, pay attention to fully tap the production potential of eight hours; Second, many units organized "high-yield week" and "high-yield, high-quality week," making this form more diverse; Third, the connection between high-yield activities and daily production is very close. After organizing "high-yield day," many units immediately consolidated the achievements made in the high-yield day and used the experience of that day to drive the level of daily production.

    At present, the movement is continuing to develop in depth. After realizing the call of "tight battle before the Spring Festival without relaxation," the vast number of employees are continuing to work hard to strive to overfulfill the February production plan.

### 北京掀起今年第一个工业生产高潮  上旬计划七天完成

    北京掀起今年第一个工业生产高潮
    上旬计划七天完成
    本报讯　北京市工业部门的职工，在春节前夕（2月7日），以超额12.7％的出色成绩，完成了2月上旬的生产计划。全市上旬实际完成的产值，占2月份全月计划的29.1％。这一旬的平均日产值比1月份平均日产值，增加了6.8％。
    北京市工业部门在超额完成了1月份的计划后紧接着又胜利地提前完成了2月上旬的计划，这表明北京工业战线群众运动今年的第一个高潮，正在迅速形成和猛烈发展。
          高潮来得早、来得猛
    这个高潮的第一个特点是来得早、来得猛。从1月下旬起，几天之内席卷全市，从石景山钢铁公司等大型企业，一直到许多区属的中小厂和手工业生产合作社，都掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众运动。这个高潮之所以来得既早又猛，一方面是由于各企业从年前起学习了党的八届六中全会文件，要在今年实现更伟大的跃进的口号深入人心，并为今年生产做了一系列准备。另一方面，经过去年一年的光辉战斗，企业领导干部和群众都有了大跃进的丰富经验，高速度已经成为许多人的习惯。因此，当1月下旬市委开会部署以后，运动就迅速进入了高潮。
    产量、质量、品种、成本全面跃进
    运动一开始就注意产量、质量、品种、成本等各项指标的全面跃进。许多企业不仅注意了产值、产量的不断跃进，而且本着全面跃进的精神，根据本单位当前生产中的关键环节，提出了鲜明的口号，如北京第一、二、三棉纺织厂的职工在完成产量计划的同时，产品质量有很大的提高。机织印染厂由于大搞节约回收，烧碱的消耗量大量降低。
    大搞群众运动和细致的管理工作相结合
    大搞群众运动和细致的管理工作相结合，是这个高潮的另一个特点。许多企业一面掀起热气腾腾的群众运动，一面注意加强了管理工作。光华木材厂为了使职工心中有数地掌握生产进度，厂、车间和班组、个人都制订了日作业计划，一天一检查，一天一总结，一天一公布。这个厂的二车间与干燥室在2月1日只完成了日作业计划的91％。第二天这一情况公布后，工人们都十分着急，立即采取了很多措施来提高生产，终于以173.3％的优越成绩，超额完成了日作业计划。
  运动锋芒指向技术革命和改进劳动组织
    这个高潮的另一个特点是：许多企业群众运动的锋芒从一开始就朝向技术革命和改进劳动组织等方面，把苦干和巧干结合起来。北京化工厂由于采取一系列技术和组织措施，2月前六天完成了全月计划的45.4％。这个厂一车间第六组生产过磷酸三丁脂，因烟气熏人不能大批生产。这一次工人们把组内闲置的三个大反应罐加以改装，使这种产品的合成反应密闭在罐内进行。不仅解决了操作安全问题，而且使这种产品的产量一下提高了十余倍。这个厂三车间的准基小组，老工人少，新工人多，他们调整了劳动组织，以老工人为骨干分成几个战斗小组，同时交叉生产几种产品，结果生产效率大大提高。
    在去年大跃进中，北京市工人群众创造的“高产日”的竞赛形式，在今年得到了进一步的发展：一，注意充分挖掘八小时的生产潜力；二，许多单位组织了“高产周”、“高产优质周”等，使这一形式更多样；三，高产活动和日常生产的联系十分密切，许多单位在组织“高产日”后，紧接着就巩固高产日中取得的成绩，用这一天的经验，去带动日常生产的水平。
    目前运动正在继续深入发展，广大职工在实现了“春节前紧张战斗不放松”的号召以后，正在继续努力，力争超额完成2月份生产计划。
