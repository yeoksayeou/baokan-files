Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Frontline, 1st - In the recent five-plus months of battles punishing the Chiang Kai-shek troops, a large number of meritorious units and individuals have emerged from the land, sea, and air forces on the Fujian Front. Their deeds fully reflect the fearless heroism of the frontline troops and their noble qualities of unwavering loyalty to defending the socialist construction of the motherland. According to incomplete statistics, 187 units have been awarded collective first-class, second-class, and third-class honors, and 3,630 individuals have been awarded special-class and first, second, and third-class honors.

On the Fujian Front, there is a saying: "Only our tenacity prevents the enemy's frenzy." The Second Platoon of the Third Company of a certain artillery unit, which was awarded the collective third-class merit, fought tenaciously in several fierce artillery battles, even though enemy shells landed on their gun emplacements, the gun barrels were scarred, and the gunners were covered in mud. They only stopped fighting after silencing the enemy's artillery and setting fire to their fuel depots. The Eighth Company of a certain artillery unit, fighting on a certain island close to Jinmen Island, was frequently attacked by intense enemy artillery fire. However, in 27 days, the artillerymen of the Eighth Company bombarded 37 military targets on Chiang Kai-shek's army positions, destroying one enemy anti-tank gun, one anti-tank fortification, and one each of command posts, observation posts, and shelters, and damaging one enemy military vehicle, earning the unit a collective second-class merit. Lu Jianwen, a Communist Party member and squad leader of the First Platoon of the Third Company of a certain artillery unit, who was awarded the first-class merit, continued to command his entire squad in battle despite being wounded in six places during an artillery battle, refusing to leave his combat post. Zhou Chunfu, a special-class merit recipient and pilot of a certain air force unit, bravely and decisively plunged into the Chiang Kai-shek army's aircraft formation in a fierce air battle on August 14th of last year, single-handedly shooting down two U.S.-made F-86 Chiang Kai-shek aircraft and damaging one. In the naval forces, a certain gunboat squadron, one day braved raging waves and heavy gunfire to approach an enemy submarine chaser several times its size, first suppressing the enemy ship's numerous and large cannons with machine guns and small cannons, and then bravely pursued and sank the Chiang Kai-shek army's 400-plus-ton warship, earning a collective second-class merit. A certain coastal artillery company, together with fraternal units, sank or damaged five Chiang Kai-shek army vessels in 28 battles. On the transportation lines, a certain transportation company transported ammunition despite the artillery fire, making 1,074 trips in two months, safely traveling 26,797 kilometers, and promptly transporting the ammunition to designated locations, ensuring combat needs, and earning a collective merit. Among those who received merit, there were telephone soldiers who rushed into the explosion zone to complete wiring tasks, cooks who insisted on cooking and delivering food to the front lines under artillery fire, drivers who skillfully completed transportation tasks through layers of artillery fire blockades, and medics who bravely rescued the wounded even while injured themselves.

Hundreds of moving deeds of class camaraderie and care for national property were also commended and rewarded in this evaluation. Soldier Yin Daan used his own body to shield the battalion commander when shrapnel was flying; Instructor Zhang Helang took the lead in fighting a fire during battle to protect the safety of the soldiers. Artilleryman Guo Chunjiu supported a stone bridge about to break with his body in cold water, preserving the artillery piece. People praised them with "Endless stories of self-sacrifice, countless heroes who rescue others."

At the front, many people have also been recognized for their selfless spirit and for protecting the lives and property of the people. Gu Shanglu, a telephone operator of a certain unit, disregarding his own safety, bandaged the wounds of injured farmers during the enemy's frantic bombardment and carried the farmer out of the danger zone despite the artillery fire. Although he was sweating profusely and dizzy from exhaustion along the way, he returned to the artillery fire blockade zone after delivering the wounded farmer to the dressing station and retrieved the injured farmer's cattle and cart.

After receiving the honors bestowed by the Party and the people, these meritorious units and individuals have expressed their determination to achieve even greater victories in defending the motherland this year and strive for greater achievements.

    只有我们顽强不准敌人疯狂
    福建前线三军将士保卫祖国建设功勋卓著
    五个月中涌现了大批立功单位和立功人员
    新华社福建前线1日电　在最近五个多月惩罚蒋军的战斗中，福建前线陆、海、空军部队，涌现出大批立功单位和立功人员。他们的事迹充分反映出前线三军无畏的英雄气概和保卫祖国社会主义建设赤胆忠心的高尚品质。据不完全的统计，荣获集体一等功、二等功、三等功的单位有一百八十七个，荣立特等功和一、二、三等功的个人有三千六百三十名。
    在福建前线有这样一句话：“只有我们的顽强，就没有敌人的疯狂。”炮兵某部荣立集体三等功的三连二班，在几次激烈的炮战中，炮床上落有敌人炮弹，炮管砸有伤痕，泥土撒满了炮手们的全身，但是他们顽强地战斗着，直把敌人的大炮打哑、油料库打着，才停止战斗。战斗在某岛上的炮兵某部第八连，离金门岛很近，经常遭到敌人密集炮火的袭击。但是，第八连的炮手，在二十七天内，轰击了三十七个蒋军阵地上的军事目标，击毁敌人战防炮一门，防坦克工事、指挥所、观察所、掩蔽部各一个，击伤敌人军用车一辆，荣获集体二等功。共产党员、荣立一等功的炮兵某部三连一班长陆鉴文，在一次炮战中六处负伤不离战斗岗位，指挥着全班进行战斗。空军某部特等功臣、飞行员周春富，在去年8月14日一场激烈空战中，英勇果敢，单机冲入蒋军机群，一举击落美制F—86型蒋机两架，击伤一架。在海军部队里，某炮艇中队，有一天在怒海狂涛和密集的弹雨中，逼近大它数倍的敌人猎潜舰，先用机关枪、小炮，把敌舰上又多又大的炮火压住，然后，勇敢地跟踪追击，把这艘四百多吨的蒋军兵舰击沉，荣立了集体二等功。某海岸炮连在二十八次战斗中，和兄弟部队一起击沉、击伤蒋军舰艇五艘。在运输线上，某部运输连冒着炮火运送弹药，两个月出车一千零七十四车次，安全行驶二万六千七百九十七公里，及时把弹药运往指定地点，保证了战斗需要，荣立了集体功。在立功的人员中，有冲入爆炸区完成接线任务的电话兵，有在炮火下坚持做饭并送饭到阵地上的炊事兵，有穿过层层炮弹封锁出色完成运输任务的驾驶兵，有自己负伤而英勇抢救伤员的卫生兵。
    数以百计的阶级友爱和爱护国家资财的动人事迹在这次评功中，也都受到了表扬和奖励。战士尹大安曾在弹片纷飞时，用自己身体掩护营长；指导员张和朗在战斗中带头扑灭大火，来保护战士的安全。炮手郭春玖在冷水中用肉体顶住将要折断的石桥，保全了大炮。人们以“写不尽的舍己事迹，唱不完的救人英雄”来歌颂他们。
    在前线，还有不少人因为忘我的精神，爱护人民群众的生命财产而立了功。某部电话员顾尚禄，在敌人疯狂轰击时，奋不顾身地给负伤农民包扎伤口，并且冒着炮火把这个农民背出危险地带。路上，他虽然累得汗水直流，头晕眼花，可是他把伤员送到包扎所以后，又返回炮火封锁区，把负伤农民的牛和车找了回来。
    这些立功的单位和人员，受到党和人民给予的荣誉以后，纷纷表示要在今年保卫祖国的岗位上，取得更大的胜利，争取功上加功。
