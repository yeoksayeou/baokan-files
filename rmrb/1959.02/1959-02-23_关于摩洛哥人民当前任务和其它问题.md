    On the Current Tasks of the Moroccan People and Other Issues
    Ali Yata, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Morocco
    I
    Morocco achieved independence on March 2, 1956. This was the result of a long and arduous struggle by the Moroccan people, with a high degree of unity and spirit of sacrifice, in a heroic fight against imperialism and its feudal running dogs.
    This independence has been recognized by the original occupying countries—France, Spain—and by countries around the world. King Mohammed V of Morocco, who had been driven out by the French government, returned to power, and a patriotic, free government replaced the original foreign regime. The Moroccan national army and its own diplomacy were established. Our country entered the United Nations.
    However, the recognition of Morocco's independence does not mean that the foreign ruling forces have been completely eliminated, nor does it mean that the pillars of foreign rule in Morocco have been completely broken. For example, there are still several powerful American military bases belonging to the North Atlantic aggressive bloc on our territory. These bases were established with the permission of the French government at the time. In addition, French and Spanish imperialism still has a large number of troops stationed in our country. They also occupy vast areas of our country with extremely rich mineral resources: Moroccan Sahara, Mauritania and Rio de Oro. They control the economic lifeline of our country, and monopoly capital still controls our mines, transportation enterprises, electricity sectors, and banks.
    On the other hand, most of the feudal bullies who used to serve as running dogs for foreign oppressors have still almost completely maintained their economic foundations.
    The imperialists and feudal national traitors are not reconciled to their political defeat by the Moroccan people, and they are trying to take revenge and restore their rule in Morocco. They are plotting to overthrow Morocco's independence. But they have only found some shameless people without any patriotic concepts to serve them. Most of these people are despicable guys who did not receive due punishment in the early days of independence. Because they also deceived some honest, but politically inexperienced patriots, they finally launched a rebellion in the Tafilalet region in January 1957; since last autumn, they have created armed rebellions in the Rif region of the north and the central Atlas Mountains.
    Under these circumstances, the prominent issue in the current situation in Morocco is that imperialism and feudal national traitors constitute a huge threat to young Morocco.
    Therefore, it is clear that the urgent task of all Moroccan people, regardless of which class they belong to, is to defend and consolidate Morocco's national independence.
    From now on, any patriot should put aside their differences, unite, be vigilant, fight back against the conspirators (whether they are French and Spanish generals, or Moroccan former guards), make the deceived patriots see the truth, leave the wrong path, and jointly prevent and smash all conspiracies.
    However, it is far from enough to limit ourselves to such a goal. There are currently foundations for conspiracies, rebellions and constant potential threats to independence in Morocco. In order to defend and consolidate independence, these foundations should be destroyed without hesitation; all French, Spanish and American troops should be driven out without leaving a single one; our still-occupied territories should be liberated: Moroccan Sahara, Rio de Oro and Mauritania; mines, electricity, transportation enterprises and banks should be nationalized in order to free our country's economy from the control of foreign monopoly capital.
    These are the main tasks for defending and consolidating Morocco's independence, ending nearly fifty years of colonial rule and freeing ourselves from the heavy burden left by feudal national traitors.
    These huge and complex tasks can only be accomplished by the people. The Moroccan people will bravely, enthusiastically, and with their spirit of sacrifice, take on these tasks. The Moroccan people understand that national independence can make their deep wishes come true. In order to mobilize the people to participate in the struggle against imperialism and for complete liberation, their demands should be met, the unemployed should be given jobs, workers' wages should be increased, the land of feudal national traitors and colonialists should be distributed to poor peasants, and democratic freedoms should be guaranteed to all patriots. Every time the people's demands are met, it is a blow to imperialism and its running dogs. This will take the cause of complete liberation of the entire nation a big step forward.
    This is the direction followed by the Communist Party of Morocco.
    II
    The people of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia are fraternal Arab people. Nothing can separate them from the territory they live on except the artificial borders erected by French imperialism. They belong to the same cultural system, speak the same language, and have the same culture and traditions. Their interests are common, and they are fighting against common imperialism to safeguard these interests. For these reasons, the people of the Arab Maghreb demand unification, and they believe that unification is a reliable way to ensure their complete liberation from imperialist rule and to build a better future.
    Such an understandable, logical, and correct desire of the people is now taking shape as an essential political demand.
    In order to maintain the initial victories gained by Morocco and Tunisia and turn them into complete victories, it is necessary to unite. In order for Algeria to defeat the French aggressors and gain freedom, it is also essential to unite.
    The meeting of representatives of the three countries in Tangier in April 1958 was the first step towards unification. But it is painful to see that the correct decisions made at this meeting have not been fully implemented. This has made the danger of the conspiracies played by the French de Gaulle rulers even more serious. It is known that de Gaulle used two methods to force Algeria to submit and guarantee the privileges of French capitalists: giving the Algerian Liberation Army a fatal blow and isolating the fighting Algeria internationally, especially separating Morocco and Tunisia from Algeria.
    Therefore, it is obvious that the first stage of achieving the unification of the Maghreb is to establish an anti-imperialist front without cracks and a united front without any reservations or restrictions.
    The fighting Algeria requires Morocco and Tunisia to take action against the reality of Algeria. This is the only answer to the constant attempts at division by the extremely reactionary rulers of France. This not only fully conforms to the interests of Algeria, but also fully conforms to the interests of Morocco and Tunisia.
    It should be emphasized that the people of the Maghreb are immensely grateful that the People's Republic of China recognized the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic and issued a joint communiqué with the representative of that government in Beijing on December 20, 1958.
    III
    After the Second World War and after the most reactionary figures of international imperialism were defeated by the Soviet Union, the people of Asia entered the most active class of the national liberation movement. They have inflicted one defeat after another on foreign tyrants. The greatest credit should go to the People's Republic of China, to the heroic Chinese people and the Communist Party of China, because they gave the most severe blow to imperialism and its running dogs, the feudal groups and the comprador bourgeoisie, and achieved brilliant victories, thus showing the most beautiful prospects for all enslaved people.
    The people of Africa and Latin America quickly followed this example. For several years, they have been taking action, demanding to smash the shackles that enslave them and to clear away the stains left by foreign occupiers from their territory. Nothing, no matter what conspiracy, threat, bloody suppression, promise, or hypocritical reform, can stop them from moving forward. They can no longer endure a life without freedom, nor can they endure that the wealth they should enjoy is used to fatten foreign parasites, because they have realized their personality and rights.
    We can confidently say that 1959 and the coming years will be years of earth-shaking historical changes in Africa and Latin America. The two continents, which were still underestimated and hardly noticed not long ago, have now been placed on the agenda. Through their people's anti-imperialist liberation struggles, these two continents have made the most significant contribution to the just cause of maintaining world peace and winning the victory of democracy and freedom, second only to the socialist camp. This struggle needs to be given the greatest help so that it can proceed more smoothly.
    IV
    Unlike the stubborn leaders of the Western world, Morocco recognized the People's Republic of China after its independence. This fact reflects the great sympathy, admiration, and deep gratitude of people from all walks of life in Morocco for China, the powerful socialist country in Asia. The Moroccan people have this sympathy, admiration, and gratitude because China, a country that was a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country in the past, as backward and poor as Morocco, but it overthrew the rule of foreign imperialism and its running dogs, the feudal groups and the comprador bourgeoisie, and achieved historic victories; it is because the new China, with a population of 650 million, is a loyal and effective ally of the people of colonial and underdeveloped countries; it is because of the brilliant achievements China has made in reconstruction and socialist construction. Every Moroccan worker, whether manual or mental, yearns for China's achievements in industrialization, land reform, health, and education. No Moroccan is not delighted by China's Great Leap Forward, because this Great Leap Forward increased China's steel production from 5.35 million tons in 1957 to 11 million tons in 1958.
    Morocco's recognition of China reflects and safeguards Morocco's national interests. There are constantly developing trade relations between the two countries. Everyone knows that the whole country of Morocco likes to drink green tea, and it is China that supplies us with green tea. China exported 7 billion francs worth of green tea to us last year; Morocco exported phosphate, canned sardines, trucks, etc. to China.
    We are confident that in the near future, the trade relations between our two countries will continue to improve and will lead to the mutual dispatch of diplomatic representatives.
    Two days ago, Comrade Mao Zedong told us: China and Morocco are geographically far apart, but both countries are anti-imperialist and are engaged in the same anti-imperialist struggle; the two countries have common interests, so they need to be friendly to each other; cooperation between the two countries on the basis of equality and mutual respect will be beneficial to both sides.
    This is also the belief of the Moroccan people and the Communist Party of Morocco. In this regard, the Communist Party of Morocco has made and will continue to make efforts.

    关于摩洛哥人民当前任务和其它问题
    摩洛哥共产党中央委员会第一书记  阿里·亚塔
    一
    摩洛哥1956年3月2日取得独立。这是摩洛哥人民经过长期艰苦奋斗，以高度的团结和牺牲精神，与帝国主义及其封建走狗进行了英勇斗争而取得的结果。
    这个独立已为原先的占领国——法国、西班牙，以及全世界各国所承认。曾经被法国政府赶走的摩洛哥国王穆罕默德五世重新执政，一个爱国的、自由的政府代替了原来的外国政权。建立起了摩洛哥民族军队和自己的外交。我们的国家进入了联合国。
    但是，摩洛哥的独立被承认，并不意味着外国统治势力已被全部肃清，并不意味着外国在摩洛哥的统治支柱已被全部打垮。例如，目前我国领土上还有属于北大西洋侵略集团的好几个强大的美国军事基地。这些基地，是在当时法国政府的允诺下建立起来的。此外，法国和西班牙帝国主义仍在我国驻有大批军队。他们还占领着我国矿藏极为丰富的广大地区：摩洛哥撒哈拉、毛里塔尼亚和里俄特俄罗。他们掌握着我国的经济命脉，垄断资本仍旧控制着我们的矿山、交通企业、电力部门和银行。
    另一方面，大部分过去充当外国压迫者走狗的封建恶霸仍然几乎完整地保持着他们的经济基础。
    帝国主义和封建的民族叛徒对摩洛哥人民迫使得他们在政治上的失败并不甘心，他们企图复仇和重新恢复在摩洛哥的统治，他们阴谋策划推翻摩洛哥的独立。但是他们只找到了一些毫无爱国观念、恬不知耻的人们来为他们效劳。这些人大部分是独立初期没有得到应有惩罚的卑鄙家伙。由于他们也欺骗了一些诚实的、然而缺乏政治经验的爱国者，他们终于在1957年1月在塔菲拉莱地区掀起叛乱；去年秋季以来又在北部里弗地区和阿特拉斯中部山区制造了武装叛乱。
    在这种情况下，摩洛哥目前形势的突出问题是帝国主义和封建的民族叛徒对年青的摩洛哥构成了巨大的威胁。
    因此，很显然，全体摩洛哥人民，不管他们属于哪一个阶层，当前的迫切任务是保卫和巩固摩洛哥的民族独立。
    从现在起，任何爱国者都应当把他们彼此之间的分歧扔在一边，团结起来，提高警惕，反击阴谋分子（不管他们是法国和西班牙的将军，或是摩洛哥的前卫长），使受到蒙蔽的爱国者看清真相，离开错误道路，共同防止和粉碎一切阴谋活动。
    但是，如果仅限于这样的目标就远远不够，目前摩洛哥存在着阴谋叛乱和对独立经常构成潜在威胁的基础，为了保卫和巩固独立，应该毫不犹豫地将这些基础加以摧毁；应该把法国、西班牙和美国军队一个也不留地全部赶走；应该解放我国尚被占领的领土：摩洛哥撒哈拉、里俄特俄罗和毛里塔尼亚；应该把矿山、电力、交通企业和银行国有化，以求得我国的经济摆脱外国垄断资本的控制。
    这些就是为了保卫和巩固摩洛哥的独立，结束将近五十年的殖民统治和解脱封建的民族叛徒遗留下来的沉重负荷的主要任务。
    这些巨大的、复杂的任务只有人民才能完成。摩洛哥人民将勇敢地、热情地、以其勇于牺牲的精神把这些任务担当起来。摩洛哥人民懂得民族独立能使他们的深切愿望付诸实现。为了发动人民参加反对帝国主义、争取彻底解放的斗争，应该满足他们的要求，给失业者以工作，提高工人工资，将封建的民族叛徒和殖民者的土地分配给贫农，保证一切爱国者的民主自由。每满足人民一点要求，也就是给帝国主义及其走狗的一次打击。这将使整个民族的彻底解放事业前进一大步。
    这便是摩洛哥共产党所遵循的方向。
    二
    摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚和突尼斯人民是兄弟的阿拉伯人民。除了法国帝国主义所树立的人为的国界外，没有任何东西能使他们从他们赖以生活的这块领土分开。他们属于同一个文化系统，讲同样的语言，具有同样的文化和传统。他们的利益是共同的，并且为了维护这些利益而反对共同的帝国主义。由于这些原因，阿拉伯马格里布的人民要求实现统一，他们认为统一就是保证他们从帝国主义统治下获得彻底解放、建设美好将来的可靠办法。
    这样一个可以理解的、合乎逻辑的和正确的人民的愿望，现在正在形成为一个必不可少的政治要求。
    为了维护摩洛哥和突尼斯所获得的初步胜利，并使之变成为彻底的胜利，统一起来是必要的。为了使阿尔及利亚战胜法国的侵略势力而获得自由，统一起来也是必不可少的。
    1958年4月在丹吉尔举行的三国人民代表会议，是走向统一的第一步。但是人们痛心地看到，这次会议所做出的正确的决定，没有完全执行。这就使法国戴高乐派的统治者所玩弄的阴谋的危险性更加剧了。人们知道，戴高乐为了强使阿尔及利亚屈服和保证法国大资本家的特权，使用了两个办法：给阿尔及利亚解放军以致命的打击，在国际范围内孤立战斗的阿尔及利亚，特别是使摩洛哥和突尼斯与阿尔及利亚分开。
    因此，显而易见，实现马格里布的统一必经的第一个阶段，便是成立一个没有裂痕的反帝战线和一个没有任何保留的、不加任何限制的团结阵线。
    在战斗中的阿尔及利亚，要求摩洛哥和突尼斯针对阿尔及利亚现实采取行动。这是对法国极端反动统治者不断进行的分裂企图的唯一答复。这不仅完全符合阿尔及利亚的利益，而且也完全符合摩洛哥和突尼斯的利益。
    应该强调的是：马格里布人民无比感激人民中国承认阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府，并和该政府的代表在1958年12月20日在北京发表了联合公报。
    三
    第二次世界大战以后以及国际帝国主义最反动的人物被苏联击溃了以后，亚洲人民进入了民族解放运动最活跃的阶级。他们使外国暴君遭受了一次又一次的失败。最大的功绩应归于人民中国，归于英勇的中国人民和中国共产党，因为他们给予帝国主义和它的走狗以最沉重的打击，并且取得了辉煌的胜利，从而为所有被奴役的人民展示出了最美好的远景。
    非洲和拉丁美洲的人民很快地仿效了这个榜样。几年以来，他们行动起来了，要求粉碎奴役他们的枷锁，并从他们的领土上清除外国占领者遗留下来的污痕。没有任何东西不论是什么阴谋诡计、威胁、血的镇压、诺言和虚伪的改革，都不能阻挡他们前进。他们再也不能忍受没有自由的生活，再也不能忍受他们自己应当享有的财富去用来喂肥外国寄生虫，因为他们已经认识到自己的人格和权利。
    我们可以有信心地说，1959年和今后几年在非洲和拉丁美洲将是发生翻天复地的历史变化的年代。还在不久以前被人们低估和几乎不为人们所注意的两个大陆，现在已经提到日程上来了。这两个大陆通过它们人民进行的反帝解放斗争，对维护世界和平和使民主与自由获得胜利的正义事业作出了仅次于社会主义阵营的最重大的贡献。这个斗争需要获得最大的帮助以便能较顺利地进行。
    四
    和西方世界顽固的领导者不同，摩洛哥独立以后，承认了人民中国。这个事实，反映了摩洛哥各阶层人民对中国这个亚洲的强大社会主义国家的巨大同情、钦佩和深切的感激。摩洛哥人民具有这种同情、钦佩和感激的心情，是由于中国这样一个在过去是半封建半殖民地的国家，落后和贫困得像摩洛哥一样，但它却打垮了外国帝国主义及其走狗封建集团和买办资产阶级的统治，获得了历史性的胜利；是由于拥有六亿五千万人口的新中国是殖民地和不发达国家人民忠诚和有效的同盟者；是由于中国在恢复工作中以及在社会主义建设中所获得的辉煌成就。每一个摩洛哥劳动者，不论是体力劳动者或脑力劳动者都向往中国在工业化、土地改革、卫生和教育方面所取得的成就。没有一个摩洛哥人不对中国的大跃进欢欣鼓舞，因为这个大跃进在1958年把中国钢的产量从1957年的五百三十五万吨增至一千一百万吨。
    摩洛哥承认中国是反映和维护摩洛哥民族利益的。两国之间进行着不断发展的贸易关系。大家知道，摩洛哥全国嗜饮绿茶，而正是中国供应我们绿茶。中国在去年向我们输出价值七十亿法郎的绿茶；摩洛哥方面则向中国输出磷矿、沙丁鱼罐头、卡车等。
    我们深信，在不久的将来，我们两国之间的贸易关系将继续改善并将导致两国互派外交代表。
    两天以前，毛泽东同志同我们说：中国和摩洛哥之间在地理位置上相距很远，但是两个国家都是反帝的，都同样进行反帝国主义的斗争；两国具有共同的利益，因此需要彼此友好；两国在平等和互相尊重的基础上进行合作，将对双方都有利。
    这也是摩洛哥人民和摩洛哥共产党的信念。在这方面摩洛哥共产党已经进行了、并将继续进行努力。
