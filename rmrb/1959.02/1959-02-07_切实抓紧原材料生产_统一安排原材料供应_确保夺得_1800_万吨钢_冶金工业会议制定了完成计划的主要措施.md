Xinhua News Agency, 6th. 1959 will be a year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leaps forward for the metallurgical industry. Employees of the national metallurgical industrial system must continue to exert their efforts, strive for advancement, oppose conservatism, break superstitions, and complete the glorious and arduous task of producing 18 million tons of steel and centering on it for the entire metallurgical industry in a fast, good, and economical way. This is the decision made by the National Conference of Directors of Metallurgical Industry Departments (Bureaus) and Heads of Key Metallurgical Enterprises.

    The conference was recently held in Beijing. According to the plan target of 18 million tons of steel production for China in 1959 stipulated by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the conference discussed the metallurgical industry plan for 1959 and formulated the main measures to complete this plan. The conference determined that in 1959, the output of pig iron, steel, copper, and aluminum nationwide should be compatible with steel production and have greater growth than in 1958; the key construction projects should reach more than one hundred, and their scale and investment amount should also greatly exceed those of 1958; the rare metal industry will also be vigorously developed in 1959. The conference pointed out that this plan has been carefully calculated and scientifically analyzed and determined. It is not only a plan full of revolutionary enthusiasm, but also a plan based on a solid and reliable foundation. To complete this plan, it is necessary to further implement the "walking on two legs" policy on the metallurgical industry front, that is, the policy of simultaneously promoting central enterprises and local enterprises, large-scale enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, and implement the policy of "taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward" and implement the policy of combining centralized leadership with vigorous mass movements. According to the principle of "the whole country as a chessboard" and ensuring the key points and taking care of the general situation, the conference uniformly arranged the supply of raw materials and equipment this year, requiring all metallurgical departments and metallurgical enterprises, whether production units or basic construction units, to follow this principle and arrange their work; promote the communist style, prioritize external needs over internal needs, and put obedience to the overall situation first and satisfying oneself second.

    After discussing and analyzing the current situation of China's metallurgical industry, the conference believes that to ensure the seizure of 18 million tons of steel this year, the primary task at present is to vigorously develop the production of coke, iron ore, and other metallurgical materials, especially to vigorously develop the production of coke. It is required that metallurgical departments and metallurgical enterprises in various regions immediately concentrate their efforts from now on and solve the problem of coke production in about a quarter of a year. The conference pointed out that to solve the problem of coke production, in addition to the efforts of major coking enterprises to increase production and the unified distribution by the state, relying on the self-reliance of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions is an extremely important part of increasing coke production this year. There are two ways: The first is to immediately and intensively build a large number of "Red Flag No. 2" simple coking ovens. This kind of simple coking oven is easy to build, requires less materials, equipment, and investment, and produces 6,000 tons of coke per year. The quality of the coke meets the needs of small and medium-sized iron-smelting furnaces. Therefore, building this kind of coking oven in large quantities can have an immediate effect on improving the quality and output of pig iron. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry decided to work together from top to bottom to rush to produce a complete set of equipment for this batch of simple coking ovens within a month and build and put them into production within two or three months. It is required that provinces, cities, and autonomous regions intensify this work, prepare refractory materials, and immediately start construction in places with convenient transportation, coal resources, and close to blast furnace clusters. Second, local methods of coking. The conference emphasized that vigorously increasing coke production is the most prominent and urgent important task of the metallurgical industry this year. In order to improve the quality of coke, whether it is a simple coking oven or a local coking oven, the raw coal used must be washed and selected to reduce the ash content in the raw coal. In addition to coke, the conference also decided to concentrate efforts to increase iron ore production by improving the mining capacity of existing mines, building a new batch of mines, and "small local groups" mining sites, and uniformly arranged the production and supply of various other metallurgical materials. The conference required that the metallurgical departments (bureaus) of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions conscientiously focus on the issue of raw material production recently, and the construction investment, materials, and equipment allocated to various regions this year should be given priority to meet the needs in this regard.

    In order to ensure the completion of the steel production task in 1959, the conference decided to take the following measures: First, launch a mass technical revolution movement to increase the average daily production level of existing rolling equipment by 50% in 1959 compared to 1958. Second, ensure that the country's rolling mills are "well-fed and well-nourished," which is a prerequisite for existing rolling equipment to increase steel production. To this end, steel plants across the country must ensure the production of good steel and uniformly allocate steel ingots and steel billets nationwide. Third, prepare for the production of new rolling mills and ensure that new rolling mills are put into production on schedule or ahead of schedule. The conference required that the metallurgical departments (bureaus) of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions immediately carry out production preparation work and strive to install and put into production a large number of newly manufactured rolling mills in the first quarter. The conference decided that existing rolling enterprises in Anshan, Taiyuan, Chongqing, Shanghai, Daye, Tianjin, Tangshan, and other places should adopt the methods of "contracting" and "leading" to help new rolling mills across the country train production workers. Fourth, strive to increase the production of the main spare parts of rolling mills—rolling rolls. To this end, the conference decided that the machine repair workshops of key iron and steel enterprises such as Anshan and Taiyuan and the metallurgical machinery manufacturing plants in Xingtai and Shenyang should increase the production of large-scale rolling rolls to supply the country; on the other hand, it required provinces, cities, and autonomous regions to add rolling roll manufacturing workshops in nearby steel plants, be self-reliant, and produce small and medium-sized rolling rolls locally.

    Regarding the basic construction of the metallurgical industry this year, the conference conducted ranking and comprehensive balancing of construction projects according to their importance and urgency, and decided to concentrate the use of building materials, equipment, and manpower to ensure the accelerated construction of more than one hundred key projects. Among these more than one hundred construction projects, there are ferrous metallurgical enterprises and non-ferrous metallurgical enterprises; there are central metallurgical enterprises (such as the continued construction of new projects such as Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation and Baotou Steel, and the expansion projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company), and there are also local metallurgical enterprises (such as Handan Iron and Steel Plant in Hebei Province and Anyang Iron and Steel Plant in Henan Province). The conference pointed out that concentrating the use of building materials and equipment and giving priority to projects directly related to increasing the production of steel, iron, steel, and coke this year will definitely ensure the completion of the great task of the metallurgical industry this year and ensure that the metallurgical industry can move forward at a faster pace this year.

    The conference also focused on the issues of rectification, consolidation, and improvement of "small local groups". The conference pointed out that the direction of consolidation and improvement of "small local groups" in iron and steel production is not only to achieve "five fixes" (fixed point, fixed type, fixed group, fixed personnel, and fixed leadership) and "two transformations" (factoryization and baseization), but also to develop towards small-scale, combined local and foreign iron and steel joint enterprises, that is, to add simple rolling mills to make local steel into finished products. Establishing such small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises including simple rolling mills widely in areas with favorable conditions has many benefits: such as forming the base points of local metallurgical industries; promoting the industrialization process of people's communes; and producing small-sized steel to meet the urgent needs of rural areas. The experience of "small local groups" will continue to be promoted this year in the production departments of coke, copper, aluminum, etc. While building large-scale coking, copper, and aluminum enterprises, vigorously develop simple coking ovens and local coking methods, and build a batch of small-scale copper concentrators and small aluminum plants combining local and foreign methods. The conference made preliminary arrangements for the construction of simple coking ovens, simple rolling mills, and small-scale copper concentrators in provinces, cities, and autonomous regions this year.

    切实抓紧原材料生产　统一安排原材料供应
    确保夺得1800万吨钢
    冶金工业会议制定了完成计划的主要措施
    新华社6日讯　1959年将是冶金工业更大、更好、更全面地跃进的一年，全国冶金工业系统的职工，必须继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，反对保守，破除迷信，多快好省地完成一千八百万吨钢和以此为中心的冶金工业全部光荣而艰巨的任务。这是全国冶金工业厅（局）长和重点冶金企业厂矿长会议所作的决定。
    这次会议是最近在北京举行的。会议根据中共八届六中全会所规定的1959年我国产钢一千八百万吨的计划指标，讨论了1959年的冶金工业计划，制定了完成这一计划的主要措施。会议确定，1959年全国生铁、钢材、铜、铝的产量和钢产量相适应，都比1958年有更大的增长；基本建设重点工程达一百多项，其规模和投资额，也大大超过1958年；稀有金属工业也将在1959年内大力发展。会议指出，这个计划是经过仔细计算和科学分析确定的，它既是一个充满着革命干劲的计划，又是一个建立在切实可靠的基础之上的计划。完成这个计划，必须在冶金工业战线上进一步贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的方针，即中央企业和地方企业、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举的方针，贯彻执行“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的方针，贯彻执行集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的方针。会议根据“全国一盘棋”和保证重点、照顾一般的原则，统一安排了今年原材料和设备的供应，要求各冶金部门、冶金企业，无论是生产单位或基本建设单位，都必须遵循这一原则，布置和安排自己的工作；发扬共产主义风格，先外后内，服从全局第一，满足自己第二。
    会议讨论和分析了当前我国冶金工业的形势后认为，确保在今年夺取一千八百万吨钢，当前首要的任务是，必须大力发展焦炭、铁矿石和其他冶金材料的生产，特别是大力发展焦炭的生产，要求各地冶金部门和冶金企业从现在起，立即集中力量，在一个季度左右的时间内，解决焦炭的生产问题。会议指出，解决焦炭生产问题，除了各大型炼焦企业努力增产并由国家统一分配外，依靠各省、市、自治区自力更生是今年增产焦炭极其重要的一环。途径有二：第一是立即突击兴建一大批“红旗二号”简易炼焦炉。这种简易炼焦炉容易建设，所需材料、设备、投资均少，每座年产焦炭六千吨，焦炭质量合乎中、小型炼铁炉的需要。因此，大批建设这种炼焦炉，对提高生铁的质量和产量，能收立竿见影之效。冶金工业部决定上下一齐动手，在一个月内赶制出这一批简易炼焦炉的成套设备，在两、三个月内建成和投入生产，要求各省、市、自治区加紧进行这个工作，准备好耐火材料，立即在交通方便、有煤炭资源和靠近高炉群的地方着手建设。第二，土法炼焦。会议强调指出，大力增加焦炭产量，是今年冶金工业一项最突出、最紧迫的重要任务；为了提高焦炭质量，无论是简易炼焦炉或土炼焦炉，所用原煤都必须经过洗选，降低原煤中的灰分。除焦炭以外，会议还决定集中力量，从提高现有矿山采矿能力、新建一批矿山和“小土群”采矿场等方面着手，增产铁矿石，并且统一安排了其他各种冶金材料的生产和供应。会议要求各省、市、自治区的冶金厅（局）最近切切实实地抓一抓原材料生产问题，今年分配给各地的建设投资、材料和设备，都要尽先满足这方面的需要。
    为了确保完成1959年的钢材生产任务，会议决定采取以下措施：一，发动群众开展技术革命运动，在1959年内把现有轧钢设备每日的平均生产水平比1958年提高50％。二，保证全国的轧钢机“吃得饱，吃得好”，这是现有轧钢设备提高钢材产量的前提。为此，全国各炼钢厂要保证炼出好钢，要在全国范围内统一调配钢锭和钢坯。三，作好新建轧钢厂的生产准备工作，保证新建轧钢机按期或提前投入生产。会议要求各省、市、自治区冶金厅（局）立即进行生产准备工作，争取在第一季度内把制造好的一大批新轧机安装好并投入生产。会议决定由鞍山、太原、重庆、上海、大冶、天津、唐山等地现有的轧钢企业，采取“包”和“带”的办法，帮助全国各地的新轧钢厂培训生产职工。四，努力增产轧钢机的主要备件——轧辊。为此，会议一方面决定由鞍山、太原等重点钢铁企业的机修车间和邢台、沈阳的冶金机械制造厂增产大型轧辊，供应全国；另一面要求各省、市、自治区在附近的钢铁厂里增建轧辊制造车间，自力更生，就地生产中小型轧辊。
    关于今年冶金工业的基本建设问题，会议就建设项目分别轻重缓急，进行了排队和综合平衡，决定集中使用建筑材料、设备和人力，保证一百多项重点工程加速建设。这一百多项建设工程中，有黑色冶金企业，也有有色冶金企业；有中央冶金企业（如继续进行的武钢、包钢等新建工程，鞍山钢铁公司和石景山钢铁公司等扩建工程），也有地方冶金企业（如河北省的邯郸钢铁厂，河南省的安阳钢铁厂等）。会议指出，集中使用建筑材料和设备，首先供应为今年增产钢、铁、钢材、焦炭等直接有关的工程，就一定能够保证完成今年冶金工业的伟大任务，保证冶金工业今年能以更快的速度向前迈进。
    会议还着重讨论了整顿、巩固和提高“小土群”的问题。会议指出，“小土群”钢铁生产巩固、提高的方向，不仅要做到“五定”（定点、定型、定组、定员、定领导）和“两化”（工厂化、基地化），还要向小型的、土洋结合的钢铁联合企业发展，即增建简易轧钢机，使土钢成材成器。在有条件的地区广泛建立这种包括简易轧钢机的小型钢铁联合企业，好处很多：如可以形成各地冶金工业的基点；可以推动人民公社工业化的进程；可以生产小型钢材，满足农村的急需等。“小土群”的经验，今年还要在焦炭、铜、铝等生产部门继续推行，在建设大型炼焦、铜、铝企业的同时，大搞简易炼焦炉和土法炼焦，建设一批土洋结合的小型铜选矿厂和小铝厂。会议对各省、市、自治区今年简易炼焦炉、简易轧钢机和小型铜选矿厂的建设，作了初步安排。
