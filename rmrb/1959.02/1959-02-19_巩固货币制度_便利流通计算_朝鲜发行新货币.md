    巩固货币制度　便利流通计算
    朝鲜发行新货币
    据新华社平壤17日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国中央银行2月17日发表公报说，朝鲜内阁在2月12日通过了关于发行新货币——朝鲜中央银行券——的决定。
    朝鲜中央银行从13日开始发行这种新货币，到17日为止，新币的兑换工作已经在朝鲜北部整个地区完成。从2月13日起，新币已成为共和国全境内唯一的收支手段。
  新币一元等于旧币一百元。
    公报说，由于朝鲜劳动党的正确的经济政策和劳动人民的忘我努力，朝鲜北部的生产得到迅速发展，国家的财政经济基础得到巩固，物价降低了，劳动人民的生活水平有了显著提高。根据这些情况，为了进一步巩固货币制度，为了便利流通和计算，共和国政府决定发行新币。公报说，全体朝鲜人民热烈欢迎新币的发行。发行新币是朝鲜人民在社会主义经济建设中取得的又一个巨大成就。这将有助于今后人民经济的发展和社会主义货币体系的进一步加强。
    朝鲜中央银行理事长金秉道今天发表谈话说，新币的发行是党和政府在巩固货币政策方面取得的一个光辉胜利。他说，在2月13日到17日这样短的期间完成了这样庞大而复杂的新币发行工作，而且秩序井然，这说明朝鲜人民发挥了高度的政治热情和自觉性，并对党和政府有着深厚的信任。
    他说，人民对新币的信任和欢迎表现在发行新币以后，人民储蓄有了显著的增加。他说，随着生产的迅速发展，朝鲜货币的物质基础将更加巩固，物价将进一步降低。
