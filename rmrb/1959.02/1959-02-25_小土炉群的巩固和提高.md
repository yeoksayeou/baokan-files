Consolidation and Improvement of Small Indigenous Furnaces
The Chinese Communist Party, Yangcheng County Committee, Shanxi Province

The work of rectifying, consolidating, and improving steel production in Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, began in early November of last year. After more than two months of effort, five indigenous-modern integrated steel bases in Yingchao, Shuicun, Ciying, Yuli, and Haoyu, and six key iron smelting sites of varying sizes in Dongye, Beiliu, etc., have basically taken shape.

These steel bases and key factories have all developed on the basis of the mass movement to produce iron and steel on a large scale. In the process of development and improvement, the "Ten Fixes" measures played an important role. The so-called "Ten Fixes" are: (1) Fix organizational structure. All levels of organization within the factory carry out their work under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, implement political command, let ideology lead the way, and fully exert the core role of the Party organization. In addition to improving Party and Youth League organizations, each factory established five sections for production, supply and marketing, finance and statistics, capital construction, and labor organization in terms of management. (2) Fix furnace type. Based on the dozen or so furnace types created by the masses during the Great Leap Forward in Steel Production, six excellent ones were selected. (3) Fix tasks. According to the production situation, it was stipulated that each square furnace should produce iron 26 times a month, with each furnace producing more than 1,000 catties of iron. Now more than 27% of the square furnaces have reached this standard; each cubic meter of blast furnace is required to produce one ton of iron per day, and 25% of the furnaces have reached the standard, and 32% have basically reached it. Seventy-eight percent of transportation, raw materials, mining, and crushing have reached the set standards. (4) Fix personnel. In order to carry out normal production, continuously improve labor productivity, and overcome wasted labor, reasonable adjustments were made based on the strength and technical level of all labor. Each square furnace was assigned eight people, a 1.5 cubic meter indigenous blast furnace was assigned ten people (two shifts), and a 6 cubic meter foreign blast furnace was assigned twenty-four people (two shifts). Leaders, material workers, mechanics, assistant engineers, ore crushing workers, etc. in each shift were also assigned specific personnel to be responsible. (5) Fix the ratio of ingredients and feeding. (6) Fix labor and rest time to ensure that workers have eight hours of sleep each day. (7) Fix tools. (8) Fix systems and technical operating procedures. A factory director responsibility system under the unified leadership of the Party committee was established, and the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" and the mass line working methods were implemented. Each type of work has formulated operating procedures and related systems. (9) Fix financial system, calculate costs monthly and daily, and publish the settlement list at any time. (10) Fix transportation.

While adopting the above "Ten Fixes" measures, the following six key links were also emphasized.

First, implement the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, carry out rectification and factory consolidation, and clear away ideological obstacles. After extensive airing of views, big debates, and great-character posters, the erroneous ideas of conservatism and emphasizing foreign methods over indigenous ones existing among cadres were severely criticized, and the temporary concept among workers, especially new workers, was eliminated, and the idea of taking the factory as home was established. Through the implementation of the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" system, cadres basically achieved "three roles and four samenesses and one promotion." The so-called "three roles" means being commanders, fighters, and technicians; the so-called "four samenesses" means eating, living, working, and discussing with the workers; and "one promotion" means actively promoting advanced experience in all aspects. Workers achieved "five roles": production managers, labor quota setters, raw material distributors, product inspectors, and cost accountants. On this basis, various management systems were established and improved, making the factory look brand new.

Second, plan raw material production areas and determine basic teams. In the process of production and construction, according to the existing scale and development prospects of steel bases and key factories, 15 new mining areas and 42 new and expanded coal areas were built. In terms of cadres and labor, a total of 153 cadres were transferred (25 cadres above the district committee secretary level), and 25,000 laborers were permanently stationed on the steel front, ensuring the normal development of steel production.

Third, continuously improve iron smelting technology. Although the people of Yangcheng County created the miracle of using anthracite coal to smelt iron in indigenous blast furnaces last year, they were not satisfied with this, but worked harder and more cleverly to improve iron smelting production technology in many ways. Employees of the county-run joint factory created the "Extra" indigenous blast furnace, which used furnace bottom heating, improved the furnace type, and thickened the furnace wall to increase the iron output rate and extend the life of the indigenous blast furnace. The Yuli Iron Plant created a method of using coal powder to tamp the furnace bottom, plaster the furnace wall, and furnace belly, which increased the furnace temperature, solved the problem of furnace bottom sticking and material blockage, and extended the life of the furnace.

Fourth, actively cultivate various technical personnel. In addition to the original 3,355 various technical personnel studying while working, methods such as sending people out, inviting people in, organizing training, and master-apprentice teaching were also adopted. Since November of last year, 315 various technical personnel have been trained at Yingchao Iron and Steel University and the spare-time technical schools of various factories. At present, chemical analysis work has been popularized among smelting workers, and 1,850 workers can basically scientifically master the content of ore and the quality of iron, accounting for 47.2% of all smelting workers. During this period, the county successively sent more than 40 people to Shaoyang in Hunan, Macheng in Hubei, and Xinyang in Henan to learn advanced experience, sent more than 10 people to Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant to learn steelmaking and steel rolling technology, and also invited 10 people from other places to provide technical guidance.

Fifth, carry out technical revolution and gradually realize "small modern groups" on the basis of small indigenous furnaces. From December of last year to now, the majority of employees have created and trial-produced more than 7,500 various indigenous machines, and used a 60-horsepower diesel engine to modify an indigenous locomotive, which can travel more than 40 miles per hour, and self-made 205 tons of indigenous railway tracks. This greatly reduced heavy manual labor, saved labor, and improved production efficiency.

Sixth, care for the lives of employees in all aspects. Cadres and workers implementing the "five samenesses" has become a habit in various steel bases and key factories. Appropriate regulations have been made regarding grain varieties and non-staple foods. All steel mills have set up medical stations, bathhouses, barber shops and other welfare facilities. Workers' accommodation and cultural entertainment have also been properly arranged, and wages are implemented through a wage system and rewards (old workers still receive their original standard). With normal production and appropriate living conditions, the majority of employees are full of energy and enthusiasm.

    小土炉群的巩固和提高
    中共山西阳城县委会
    山西省阳城县整顿、巩固和提高钢铁生产的工作，是从去年11月初开始的。经过两个多月的努力，应朝、水村、茨营、峪礼、蒿峪五个土洋结合的钢铁基地和东冶、北留等六个大小炼铁重点，已经基本形成。
    这些钢铁基地和重点厂，都是在大搞钢铁群众运动的基础上发展起来的。在发展、提高过程中，“十定”的措施起了重要的作用。所谓“十定”是：（一）定组织机构。厂内各级组织都在党委的统一领导下进行工作，实行政治挂帅，思想先行，充分发挥了党组织的核心作用。各厂除了健全党团组织外，在管理上，每个基地分别设立了生产、供销、财统、基建、劳组五个科。（二）定炉型。根据大战钢铁中群众创造出来的十几种炉型，选择了其中优良的六种。（三）定任务。根据生产情况，规定方炉月出二十六次铁，每炉产铁千斤以上，现在已有27％以上的方炉达到了这个标准；高炉每立方公尺要求日产铁一吨，现已有25％的炉达到标准，32％的炉基本达到。运输、原料、采矿、碎料等78％达到了所定的标准。（四）定人员。为了进行正常生产，不断提高劳动生产率，克服窝工浪费，根据所有劳动力的强弱和技术高低，作了合理的调整，每个方炉定八人，一点五立方公尺的土高炉定为十人（两班制），六立方公尺洋高炉定为二十四人（两班制）。各班中的组长、料工、机工、助工、碎矿工等，也都分别固定了专人负责。（五）定配料和上料比例。（六）定劳动和作息时间，保证职工每日有八小时的睡眠。（七）定工具。（八）定制度和技术操作规程。建立了在党委统一领导下的厂长负责制，执行了“两参一改三结合”和群众路线的工作方法。各个工种分别制定了操作规程和有关制度。（九）定财务制度，每月每日核算成本，随时结算出榜公布。
  （十）定运输。
    在采取上述“十定”措施的同时，还着重抓住了以下六个环节。
    首先，贯彻党的八届六中全会决议的精神，进行整风、整厂，扫清思想障碍。经过大鸣大放大辩论，狠狠地批判了干部中存在的保守不前和重洋轻土的错误思想，消除了工人中特别是新工人中的临时观念，树立了以厂为家的思想。通过推行“两参一改三结合”制度，干部基本做到了三员四同一推广。所谓三员，就是既是指挥员，又是战斗员和技术员；所谓四同，就是与工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量；一推广是积极推广各方面的先进经验。工人做到了五员：即生产管理员、劳动定额员、原料领发员、产品验收员、成本核算员。在这个基础上建立和健全了各种管理制度，使工厂面貌焕然一新。
    其次，规划原料产地，确定基本队伍。在边生产边建设的过程中，根据钢铁基地和重点厂的现有规模和发展前途，又新建矿区十五个，新建和扩建煤区四十二处。在干部和劳动力方面，共调配干部一百五十三人（区委书记以上干部二十五人），全县固定在钢铁战线上的劳动力达二万五千人，保证了钢铁生产的正常发展。
    第三，不断提高炼铁技术。阳城县人民在去年虽然创造了土高炉无烟煤炼铁的奇迹，但并没有以此为满足，而是更加苦干巧干，从多方面改进了炼铁生产技术。县联合厂职工创造了“号外”土高炉，用炉底加热，改进炉型，加厚炉壁的办法，提高了出铁率，延长了土高炉的寿命。峪礼铁厂创造了用煤面捣炉底、糊炉壁、炉腹，提高了炉温，解决了高炉结底、恳料问题，延长了炉子的寿命。
    第四，积极培养各种技术人员。除原有的各种技术人员三千三百五十五人边生产边深造以外，还采取了派出去、请进来，组织训练，以及师傅带徒弟等办法。从去年11月以来，在应朝钢铁大学和各厂的业余技术学校又培养出各种技术人员三百一十五人。目前化验工作已经普及到冶炼工人中，有一千八百五十名工人基本上能够科学地掌握矿石含量和铁的质量，占全部冶炼工人的47.2％。在这期间，全县先后派出四十多人到湖南邵阳、湖北麻城、河南信阳等地学习先进经验，派出十余人到长治钢铁厂学习炼钢和轧钢技术，还从外地请来十人进行技术指导。
    第五，开展技术革命，在小土炉群的基础上逐步实现“小洋群”。从去年12月到现在，广大职工共创造与试制成功各种土机械七千五百多件，并用六十马力的柴油机改制成了土火车头，每小时可行四十多里，自制土铁道轨二百零五吨。这样就大大地减轻了笨重的体力劳动，节省了劳动力，提高了生产效率。
    第六，从各方面关心职工生活。干部和工人实行“五同”，在各钢铁基地和重点厂已经形成习惯。在粮食品种和副食品方面都作了适当规定。所有钢铁厂都设立了医疗站、澡塘、理发室等福利设施。工人的住宿和文化娱乐，也都作了妥善安排，工资则实行了工资制和奖励的办法（老工人仍按原标准领取）。生产正常，生活适当，因而广大职工个个精神焕发，干劲十足。
