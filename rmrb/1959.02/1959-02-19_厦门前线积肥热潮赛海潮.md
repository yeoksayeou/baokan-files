    The members of the Qianxian People's Commune on the Xiamen coastal defense frontlines are twisting the struggle against the enemy and the production movement into a thick rope, tightly around the enemy's neck.
    Like all other places in the country, the members of the Qianxian People's Commune are busy accumulating fertilizer. One early morning, I drove my car along the crisscrossing coastal roads, and almost everywhere I could see slogans and resolutions for accumulating fertilizer. Some were posted on tree trunks felled by artillery shells, and others were posted on wheelbarrows. Near the artillery positions, many new urinals and temporary toilets had been set up. Every few steps I encountered a cart after cart of fertilizer-transporting teams; the cattle herders were carrying manure baskets in their hands. On the seashore, on the mountains, inside and outside the villages, there were crowds accumulating fertilizer, and there were piles of fertilizer like mountains. I inquired and found out that the day before, the commune had assigned a task for a concentrated fertilizer accumulation effort, and this task was transmitted like lightning from the battalion to the company, from the company to the platoon, and from the platoon to the squad, and everyone was vying to be at the forefront of fertilizer accumulation. Many people got up in the middle of the night to work. Those near the sea went to the sea to dig sea fertilizer, and those near the mountains went to the mountains to burn grass and wood ash, truly using every means and leaving no stone unturned.
    In Gaolin Village, there was a female commune member named Zhong Jinzhi, who was an activist in the army-civilian unity production brigade. She had just returned from registering her child to join the army, and it was almost midnight. When she heard that the commune was going to launch a concentrated fertilizer accumulation effort, she quickly prepared her tools and woke up before long, fearing that she would fall behind. There were also nine girls in this village who were famous for being brave and calm in the struggle against the enemy. The villagers called them the "Nine Beauties Squad." The eldest sister, Lin Xiuying, was the brigade's cook. In order to let everyone eat early and accumulate more fertilizer, she quietly went to the kitchen in the middle of the night to cook. And what about the other girls? They also got up especially early. On this day, the "Nine Beauties Squad" accumulated more fertilizer than any other squad with equivalent labor power. The seventh sister, Sun Xiujin, went to the pigsty where the troops raised pigs and shoveled and dug, accumulating 125 loads of fertilizer in one morning.
    On this day, I heard and saw countless inspiring deeds of people on the frontlines of the commune working hard to accumulate fertilizer in order to strive for a bumper summer harvest. Guo Shuochuan

    厦门前线积肥热潮赛海潮
    厦门海防前线的前线人民公社的社员们，把对敌斗争和生产运动拧成了一股粗粗的绳子，紧紧地套在敌人的脖子上。
    和全国各地一样，前线人民公社的社员们，正在为积肥忙碌着。一天清晨，我驾着汽车，沿着纵横交错的海边公路跑，一路上几乎处处能看到积肥的标语、口号和决心书。有的贴在被炮弹炸倒的树干上，有的贴在独轮车上。在炮兵阵地附近，新设了许多小便缸、新挖了临时厕所。不多远就遇到一车又一车的运肥队伍；放牛的人，手里都提着粪箕。在海边、在山上、村里村外，那里都有积肥的人群，那里都有堆成山的肥料。我打听了一下，原来是前一天公社布置了突击积肥任务，这个任务像闪电似的由营传到连，连传到排，排传到班，大家都争着走在积肥的最前头。不少人在三更半夜就起来干。靠海就下海挖海肥，靠山就上山烧草木灰，真是千方百计，无孔不入。
    在高林村，有一个名叫钟金治的女社员，她是军民团结生产大队的积极分子。她刚给孩子报名参军回来，这时快午夜了，她听说社里要突击积肥，连忙准备好工具，没睡多久就醒过来，唯恐自己掉了队。这个村还有九位姑娘，以在对敌斗争中勇敢、沉着而著名，村里人称她们是“九秀班”。大姐林秀英，是大队的炊事员，为了叫大伙儿早吃饭多积肥，她半夜里就悄悄地到厨房去做饭。其他的姑娘们呢？也起得格外早。这一天，“九秀班”积的肥比同等劳动力的那一个班都要多。七姐孙秀锦一个人，跑到部队养猪的猪栏去，连铲带挖，一个上午积肥一百二十五担。
    这一天，我在前线公社听到看到人们为了争取夏季丰收，而进行着积肥的豪迈劳动事迹，真是不胜枚举。　郭说传
