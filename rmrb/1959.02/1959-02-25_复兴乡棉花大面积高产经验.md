Experiences of Large-Scale High-Yield Cotton Production in Fuxing Township
By our reporters Fú Jūn and Wén Bīn

Last year, Fuxing Township in Chaoxian County, Anhui Province, achieved a bumper harvest of 610 jin of ginned cotton per mu on its 21,900 mu of cotton fields, an increase of 7.97 times compared to the average yield per mu in 1957. Among them, 139 mu of cotton fields averaged 1,600 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

Fuxing Township carried out a series of technical revolutions in cotton planting last year. First, it implemented rational close planting, increasing the number of plants per mu from the past 2,000 to about 5,000, with the most reaching 7,000. When to top the cotton plants? In the past, the rule was "Top after the Autumn Begins." However, people began to question this age-old rule. Based on their cotton planting experience in recent years, they found that autumn cotton bolls grew larger and more numerous than summer bolls, and were also easier to set. They analyzed that this was mainly because the local autumn climate was relatively normal, with temperatures generally between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius, which was suitable for flowering and fruiting. Moreover, the autumn flowers and bolls grew on the upper part of the cotton plants, where there was good light and ventilation, so the survival rate of autumn bolls was high. Therefore, they believed that the practice of "topping after the Autumn Begins" was incorrect and should be postponed until "White Dew" to ensure both summer and autumn bolls, allowing the cotton plants to grow fully. Due to the delayed topping, each cotton plant increased by four to five cotton bolls last year. According to experiments conducted by the Yuejin Brigade with 200 cotton plants, the average number of cotton bolls per plant was originally 29. Because of the delayed topping, the average increased to 71 cotton bolls per plant, and the number of autumn bolls exceeded the number of summer bolls. It is estimated that the whole township increased production by more than 30% as a result.

Should the side shoots (remove the tips of the fruiting branches) of the cotton plants be removed? In the past, side shoots were not removed, resulting in excessively dense branches and leaves in the middle of the cotton plants, which easily led to flower and boll drop. Last year, Fuxing Township broke with convention and generally removed the side shoots, making the fruiting branches shorter at the bottom of the cotton plants and longer as they went upward. The advantage of doing this is that it removes excess branches and leaves, making it easier for the middle and lower parts of the cotton plants to ventilate and receive light, which is conducive to cotton growth and can increase the survival rate of autumn bolls.

How to ensure ventilation and light transmission after close planting? This is a major issue. The township Party committee repeatedly studied in the experimental fields and adopted the method of tying the fruiting branches with strips of cloth (so that the fruiting branches could grow obliquely upward). At the same time, the method of pushing the plants together and separating the plants to see the sun was also adopted to ensure that the middle and lower parts of the cotton plants received sufficient sunlight.

In order to prevent flower and boll drop, Fuxing Township adopted the method of artificial pollination. Commune members used brushes to carry out artificial pollination every morning, increasing the boll setting rate by 16% compared to the past. In order to prevent boll drop and boll rot, Fuxing Township used a brush to dip in naphthalene acetic acid, reducing the boll drop rate by about 6% to 25% compared to the past. Excessive moisture on the cotton bolls is also a cause of rot and drop, so commune members used lime wrapped in gauze, and gently patted the cotton bolls as if women were applying powder, to absorb moisture and prevent boll drop and boll rot. In order to prevent excessive vegetative growth, the method of applying fertilizer frequently and sparingly was adopted. Last year, in addition to sufficient base fertilizer, the cotton fields were generally fertilized about 12 to 15 times. Various effective measures were also taken in preventing wind and insect pests.

In the great cotton field technical revolution, Fuxing Township particularly emphasized implementing various advanced cotton planting techniques among the masses, requiring everyone to understand the techniques. Four cotton planting technology teaching stations were established throughout the township to teach whatever was needed based on the growth of the cotton. Cotton planting technology courses were generally offered in 22 agricultural middle schools, red and expert schools, and 83 spare-time folk schools. Physical specimens and cotton planting technology diagrams were placed beside villages and roads, with people explaining them at any time. To facilitate the masses in learning the techniques, the entire set of cotton planting knowledge was drawn on the walls in the form of pictures, with accompanying text explanations. Now, 70% to 80% of the farmers in the township basically understand cotton planting technology, and some have become cotton planting experts.

In order to ensure the realization of 1,000 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year, the cadres and masses of Fuxing Township have formulated various specific measures: (1) All will use the Dai-character cotton improved varieties and complete sowing before Qingming; (2) Ordinary fields should be deeply ploughed to a depth of one chi, three cun deeper than last year, and high-yield fields should be deeply ploughed to a depth of more than two chi; (3) Plant 5,000 cotton plants per mu, requiring 70% of the cotton fields to be transplanted with nutrient pots; (4) Apply 3,000 to 4,000 dan of fertilizer per mu of cotton field, an increase of about 50% compared to last year, and weed eight times; (5) Ensure that the cotton fields are not dry; (6) Improve tools and increase work efficiency; (7) Build their own local pesticide factories; (8) Set up full-time cadres to specifically study and promote new cotton planting techniques; implement contracting production to the team, assigning tasks to the group, implementing measures to the field, and assigning responsibility to the individual.

Currently, the county is making various preparations for cotton planting.

    复兴乡棉花大面积高产经验
    本报记者　茀君  文斌
    安徽巢县复兴乡去年种植的二万一千九百多亩棉花，获得了亩产皮棉六百一十斤的大丰收，比1957年平均亩产量增长七点九七倍。其中有一百三十九亩棉田，平均亩产皮棉一千六百斤。
    复兴乡去年植棉进行了一系列的技术革命。首先实行了合理密植，每亩的棵数一般由过去的二千棵增加到五千棵左右，最多的达到七千棵。什么时候打顶心？过去是“立过秋，把头揪”。但是人们却对这种千年不变的老规矩发生了怀疑，他们根据几年来植棉的经验，发现秋天的棉桃比夏天长的又大又多，还容易坐桃。他们分析，这主要是由于本地秋天的气候比较正常，温度一般在摄氏二十度到三十度之间，适宜于开花结果。而且秋天的花铃和棉桃又都生长在棉棵的上部，光照好，又透风，所以秋桃成活率高。因此，他们认为，“立过秋，把头揪”的做法是不对的，应该推迟到“白露”打顶心，这样既保夏桃，又大抓秋桃，让棉棵充分生长。由于推迟打顶心　去年每棵棉棵都增加了四个到五个棉桃。据跃进大队用二百棵棉棵做试验，原来平均每棵有二十九个棉桃，因为推迟打顶心，平均每棵增加到七十一个棉桃，秋桃的数量超过了夏桃的数量。全乡计算因此增产30％以上。
    棉棵要不要打边心（摘掉台枝的尖端）呢？过去是不打边心的，结果棉棵中间的枝叶过密，容易脱花烂桃。复兴乡去年打破陈规，普遍打了边心，在棉棵下面，使果枝留短些，愈向上愈留长些。这样做的好处是，去掉多余的枝叶，使棉棵中间和下部容易通风和透光，便于棉花生长，而且可以增加秋桃成活率。
    密植以后如何保证通风透光？这是个大问题。乡党委在试验田反复研究，采用了破布条扎吊果枝的办法（这样可以使果枝倾斜向上生长）。同时还采用了推棵并垅，分株见阳的办法，使棉棵中间和下部充分得到光照。
    为了防止花铃脱落，复兴乡采用了人工授粉的办法。社员们每天上午用毛笔进行人工传粉，使花铃结桃率比原来提高16％。为了防止落桃烂桃，复兴乡用毛笔蘸涂萘乙酸的办法，使棉桃脱落率比过去减少6％到25％左右。棉桃上水分过多，也是易烂易落的原因，社员们就用石灰包在纱布里面，像妇女扑粉似的在棉桃上轻轻扑打，以吸收水分，防止落桃烂桃。为了防止疯长，采取了勤施少施肥的办法。去年棉田除有充足的基肥，一般都上肥十二次到十五次左右。在防风防虫害方面，也采取了各种有效措施。
    复兴乡在大闹棉田技术革命中，特别强调把各种先进植棉技术贯彻到群众中去，要求人人懂技术。全乡成立了四个植棉技术传授站，根据棉花生长情况，做什么讲授什么。在二十二所农业中学、红专学校和八十三所业余民校内普遍开设植棉技术课。村旁路边摆着实物标本和植棉技术图解，有人随时进行讲解。为便于群众学习技术，还把整套的植棉知识，用图画的形式画在墙上，配上文字说明。现在全乡农民已有70％到80％的人基本上懂得了植棉技术，有些人已成为植棉专家。
    为了保证实现今年亩产皮棉一千斤，复兴乡的干部和群众已经订出各项具体措施：（1）全部采用岱字棉良种，在清明前播种完毕；
  （2）一般田要做到深耕一尺，比去年加深三寸，丰产田深耕二尺以上；（3）每亩植棉五千棵，要求有70％的棉田用营养钵移栽；（4）每亩棉田施肥三千到四千担，比去年增加50％左右，锄草八遍；（5）保证棉田不旱；（6）改良工具，提高工效；（7）自建土农药厂；（8）设专职干部专门研究推广植棉新技术；实行包产到队、任务到组、措施到田、责任到人。
    目前，这个县正在为种棉作种种准备工作。
