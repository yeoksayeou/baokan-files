Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 17th: The solemn call issued by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for the comprehensive development of communist society construction has aroused unprecedented labor enthusiasm among the Soviet people. A nationwide socialist labor competition to complete and overfulfill the Seven-Year Plan is unfolding magnificently throughout the Soviet Union.

    Following the lead of the Ryazan Oblast in initiating the call to complete the Seven-Year Plan for meat and milk production ahead of schedule in agriculture, the mighty army on the industrial front has also taken action. The Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, rich in oil, took the lead in challenging oil workers across the country to complete the first year of the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. They actively responded to the call of the 21st CPSU Congress to accelerate the development of the oil and gas industry, further utilized the internal potential of enterprises, and widely adopted the latest achievements in science and technology and advanced experience. After accurate calculations were made in each work team, section, enterprise, and factory, it was decided to complete the 1959 oil production plan ahead of schedule, and to produce 150,000 tons of oil, 3 million cubic meters of gas, and 150,000 tons of oil products for the state above the planned target. In addition, the drilling speed and labor productivity will be increased compared to last year, and the production cost will be greatly reduced.

    This call from the oil workers of Bashkir immediately received a warm response from oil workers across the country. The oil workers of the Tatar oil region, one of the main oil-producing areas of the Soviet Union, immediately expressed their desire to stand at the forefront of the competition. Many drilling teams are determined to increase the drilling speed, ensuring that the average drilling length of each work team reaches 16,000 meters this year, which is several thousand meters faster than the original planned speed.

    Oil workers in Baku, Ashgabat, Kuibyshev and other places have also put forward their own competition conditions.

    Coal miners are also at the forefront of this socialist labor competition. The Kuzbass tunneling workers are determined to complete 117% of the plan every month, complete the Seven-Year Plan in six years, and have issued a challenge to the Donbass miners. The Donbass miners have already accepted the challenge, and many workers have proposed to complete at least 140% of the plan every day and complete the Seven-Year Plan in five years.

    响应全面开展共产主义建设的庄严号召
    苏联工业战线号角齐鸣
    石油和煤矿工人决心提前完成生产任务
    新华社莫斯科17日电　苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会提出的全面开展共产主义社会建设的庄严号召，引起了苏联人民劳动热情的空前高涨。一个全民的为完成和超额完成七年计划的社会主义劳动竞赛正在苏联各地波澜壮阔地开展起来。
    继梁赞州首倡在农业方面开展提前完成肉类、牛奶的七年计划的号召之后，工业战线上的大军也纷纷地行动了起来。盛产石油的巴什基尔自治共和国率先向全国石油工人提出了提前完成七年计划的第一年计划的挑战。他们积极响应苏共二十一大提出的加速发展石油和煤气工业的号召，进一步利用企业内部潜力，广泛采用科学技术的最新成就和先进经验。在每个工作队、工段、企业、工厂作了精确计算之后，决定要提前完成1959年的采油计划，并且要给国家超计划生产十五万吨石油、三百万立方公尺煤气和十五万吨石油产品。此外，钻井速度、劳动生产率都要比去年提高，生产成本要大大减低。
    巴什基尔的石油工人这一号召立刻得到了各地石油工人的热烈响应。苏联主要石油产地之一的鞑靼油区的石油工人立即表示要站在竞赛的最前列。许多钻井队都下决心提高钻井速度，保证每个工作队的平均钻井长度要在今年达到一万六千公尺，即比原定计划速度多了几千公尺。
    巴库、阿什哈巴德、古比雪夫等地石油工人也纷纷提出了自己的竞赛条件。
    走在这个社会主义劳动竞赛的前列的还有煤矿工人。库兹巴斯的掘井工人下决心要每月完成计划117％，在六年内完成七年计划，并向顿巴斯矿工下了挑战书。顿巴斯矿工已经应战，许多工人提出每天至少要完成计划140％，要在五年完成七年计划。
