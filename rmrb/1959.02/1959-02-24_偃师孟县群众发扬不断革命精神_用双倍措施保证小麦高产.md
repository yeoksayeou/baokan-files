The masses in Yanshi and Meng Counties, Henan Province, are emulating the spirit of continuous revolution to guarantee high wheat yields through doubled measures.

Zhengzhou, February 23 (reported by this newspaper) – After scientifically summarizing the excellent results of this year's wheat sowing quality and early-stage wheat management, Yanshi County, Henan Province, has set an increased production target of guaranteeing 3,000 jin per mu of wheat for the entire county.

Yanshi County's original wheat target was to guarantee 1,200 jin per mu. The Yanshi County Committee of the Communist Party, in accordance with the spirit of continuous revolution, and in order to organize a greater leap forward in 1959, mobilized cadres throughout the county from top to bottom to summarize achievements and find positive factors for increasing wheat production, thereby understanding the potential for wheat yield increases this year.

First, they looked at the growth of winter wheat. Due to early and effective management of all 460,000 mu of wheat in the county, wheat tillering is high and seedlings are strong. All wheat fields were divided into three types: 200,000 mu of high-yield fields and satellite fields already have 2 million plants per mu, with a yield of 4,000 jin per mu; 150,000 mu of basic fields already have 1.3 million plants per mu, with a yield of 2,600 jin per mu; and 110,000 mu of general fields have 900,000 plants per mu, with a yield of 1,800 jin per mu. Averaged over the 460,000 mu of wheat, the average yield per mu could reach 3,017 jin. Although these wheat plants have already emerged, the three types of seedlings still have two to three latent tillers, and the first-class seedlings still have one to two latent tillers. If later management is even better, yields will be even higher. These vivid facts greatly encouraged the revolutionary zeal of the masses. Therefore, they revised the original target of 1,200 jin per mu to a guarantee of 3,000 jin. This target is both ambitious and reliable.

Now, the cadres and masses of Yanshi County are taking measures for a yield of 5,000 jin per mu, with the zeal of 10,000 jin per mu, and are striving to guarantee the realization of the 3,000 jin per mu wheat plan from five aspects:

(1) In addition to the 80,000 jin of base fertilizer and top dressing already applied per mu, Yanshi County is determined to apply an average of another 70,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. Currently, the total amount of various fertilizers accumulated, plus the base fertilizer, has increased six times compared to last year, but it is still 40% short of people's requirements. More than 46,000 people are now mobilized to accumulate fertilizer every day, with a daily progress of 400 to 500 million jin. All 1,278 local fertilizer plants in the county are also working day and night to produce local fertilizer.

(2) Water five more times before the wheat harvest. They are now trying every means to expand the irrigated area. All 31 relatively large canals in the county have been started to be built, so that the water-irrigated wheat area expands from 180,000 mu to 250,000 mu. In some hilly areas with poor water conservancy conditions, 3,000 people are now carrying water from more than 1,700 water cellars to irrigate point by point, and more than 4,800 water wells are irrigating day and night in shifts, so that people are idle but wells are not. Even in hilly areas with poor water conservancy conditions, water must be carried to irrigate it twice.

(3) Vigorously develop high-yield squares and satellite fields to promote the advanced to lead the backward, and vigorously carry out large-scale high-yield movements. There are 25 high-yield squares in the county, totaling 200,000 mu, with large squares covering small squares, and every square has satellites. The county has launched a 5,000-jin township, 10,000-jin management district, and 10,000-jin team movement.

(4) Strengthen scientific and technological management. Now many management districts in this county have one local expert for every hundred mu of wheat field, one agricultural technician for every fifty mu, and one technician for every ten mu. Each township has established a monitoring station, and is now digging soil to check insect conditions. An average of seven jin of pesticides per mu of land has already been obtained.

(5) In order to do a good job in wheat field management, the first secretaries from the county to the team are in command, establishing a responsibility system of dividing areas and contracting tasks to be responsible to the end. Agricultural secretaries focus on high-yield squares and comprehensively grasp wheat management. A red flag competition is carried out throughout the county. The mobile red flag in the 10,000-mu 10,000-jin high-yield area has been evaluated eleven times. While carrying out the competition, a responsibility system is also implemented. Adopt the method of contracting leadership, contracting output, contracting indicators, contracting work points; setting tasks, setting measures, setting labor, setting quality, setting time. Task indicators go to the field, technical measures go to the field, and inspection and acceptance go to the field. (Zhang Lizhong)

Zhengzhou, February 23 (reported by this newspaper) – The people of Meng County, Henan Province, are exerting even greater efforts, re-revising indicators, and increasing measures. The original plan of an average wheat yield of 1,200 jin per mu, striving for 2,000 jin, has been revised to guarantee 3,000 jin, with two 3,500-jin communes, six 3,000-jin communes, 120 5,000-jin squares, and 10,000-mu 10,000-jin fields.

Based on the current wheat growth situation in the county, the realization of this grand target is fully conditional and based on facts. Meng County has already accumulated rich experience in high wheat yields last year. Wheat has successfully passed the sowing stage and winter management stage. As of February 16, all 300,000 mu of wheat in the county have achieved two fertilizations and three irrigations, of which 200,000 mu have had three fertilizations and three irrigations; 52,000 mu have had four fertilizations and four irrigations; and 11,000 mu have reached five fertilizations and five irrigations. Wheat seedlings are generally lush, strong, and pleasingly tender green. According to inspection calculations, the 72,000 mu of satellite fields have reached about 2 million tillers per mu. Calculated at 40 grains per ear, the average yield per mu can reach 5,300 jin; the 110,000 mu of high-yield fields have 1.5 million tillers per mu, with a yield of 4,000 jin; and the 118,000 mu of general fields have more than 800,000 tillers per mu, with a yield of 2,130 jin. Calculated according to the current situation, the average wheat yield per mu in the county can reach 3,240 jin.

In order to ensure the realization of wheat high-yield targets, and combining soaring enthusiasm with scientific management, six major measures are adopted: First, put politics in command and vigorously carry out mass movements. In conjunction with the rectification of communes and production, repeatedly publicize the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. And carry out large-scale airing of views, debates, and criticisms, criticizing complacency and right-leaning conservative thoughts in wheat field management. Promote the spirit of vigorous and skillful work, and establish a style of combining bold thinking and daring to do with scientific analysis, and quickly launch a wheat field management movement in which every household is mobilized and everyone participates. Second, put fertilizer in command, build water conservancy, and ensure that wheat is well-fed and watered. In spring, 25 billion jin of coarse fertilizer and 60 million jin of local chemical fertilizer must be accumulated. Half of this should be completed before February, and it should be accumulated and applied at the same time, accumulating and applying in large quantities. From now until the wheat harvest, three fertilizations and three irrigations should generally be carried out, five fertilizations and five irrigations in high-yield fields, and seven fertilizations and seven irrigations in satellite fields. Third, grasp both ends and bring along the middle, expand first-class seedlings, improve second-class seedlings, and eliminate third-class seedlings to ensure that every plot grows well and every mu yields a bumper harvest. Fourth, do a good job in preventing the five major disasters of frost, hail, insects, wind, and disease to wheat. Communes should establish disease and insect monitoring stations, squares should establish disease and insect monitoring groups, and teams should set up monitors, inspecting every five days and reporting every ten days. In order to prevent wheat lodging, water should be applied early for greening and late for jointing. Apply more plant ash and potassium fertilizer externally. Press down the soil in a timely manner to control excessive growth. After jointing, according to the wheat seedling growth situation, erect pillars and add nets in the wheat field to prevent lodging. Fifth, vigorously carry out tool reform to improve labor efficiency. By the beginning of March, the entire county will realize vehicle transportation and roller bearingization, achieving one vehicle per household, and transportation without carrying burdens. And a large number of harvesting machines, threshing machines, and other tools will be manufactured to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor during the harvest season. Sixth, secretaries take command, strengthen leadership, vigorously develop high-yield squares, and establish a responsibility system. In order to strengthen the leadership of high-yield squares, the county established a wheat high-yield headquarters, and each commune established a wheat high-yield command post. A command platform is set up in the high-yield square, and a wheat field management file is established. And fix professional teams according to the square, establish a responsibility system, so that every road has a commander, every square has a general, every plot has soldiers, everyone is responsible, every point is not missed, and every mu yields a bumper harvest. Use the method of combining cadres, masses, and technology to manage satellite command fields and guide the overall situation. And launch a red flag competition movement between communes and communes, squares and squares, and people and people throughout the county. (Fang Huang)

    偃师孟县群众发扬不断革命精神
    用双倍措施保证小麦高产
    本报郑州23日电　河南省偃师县科学地总结了今年小麦播种质量和小麦前期管理优异成绩以后，订出了保证全县小麦亩产三千斤的增产指标。
    偃师县今年原订小麦指标是保证亩产一千二百斤。中共偃师县委根据不断革命的精神，为了组织1959年更大的跃进，发动全县干部从上而下地总结成绩，找小麦增产的积极因素，从而摸到了今年小麦增产的底。
    首先他们看了一下冬小麦生长情况。全县四十六万亩小麦由于管理得早、管理得好，小麦分蘖多、麦苗壮。全部麦田分三种类型站了一下队，二十万亩丰产田和卫星田，每亩已有二百万株，亩产可达四千斤；十五万亩基本田每亩已有一百三十万株，亩产可达二千六百斤；一般田十一万亩，每亩有九十万株，亩产可达一千八百斤。四十六万亩小麦平均起来，每亩产麦可达三千零一十七斤。这些小麦虽然已经出了这些麦株，但三类麦苗中还有二至三个潜伏蘖，一类麦苗中还有一至二个潜伏蘖。如果后期管理得更好，产量还会更多。这些生动的事实大大鼓舞了广大群众的革命干劲。因此他们把原来亩产一千二百斤的指标修订为保证三千斤。这个指标既积极又可靠。
    现在，偃师县的干部和群众，正拿出亩产五千斤的措施，亩产万斤的干劲，从五个方面努力保证亩产小麦三千斤计划的实现。
    （1）偃师县除每亩已施底肥追肥八万斤外，决心每亩平均再施七万斤肥。现在共积各种肥料，加上底肥虽比去年施肥量增加六倍，但距人们的要求还差40％，现在每天出动积肥的四万六千多人，日进度四至五亿斤。全县有一千二百七十八个土化肥厂也正在日夜赶制土化肥。
    （2）到麦收再浇五水。现在他们想尽办法扩大灌溉面积。全县三十一条比较大的渠道已动工修筑，使水浇麦从十八万亩扩大到二十五万亩。有些水利条件不好的山岗地，现在有三千人从一千七百多个水囤里挑水点浇，四千八百多个水井日夜轮浇，作到人闲井不闲。就是水利条件不好的山岗地，也要挑水浇它两遍。
    （3）大抓丰产方、卫星田，以先进带动落后，大搞大面积高产运动。全县有二十五个丰产方，共二十万亩，大方套小方，方方有卫星。全县已开展了五千斤乡、万斤管理区、万斤队运动。
    （4）加强科学技术管理。现在这个县有好多管理区作到百亩麦地一个土专家，五十亩一个农技师，十亩一个技术员。各个乡建立了测报站，现在已着手掘土查虫情，每亩地已平均有了七斤农药。
    （5）为了搞好麦田管理，从县到队都是第一书记挂帅，建立分片包干负责到底的责任制。农业书记以丰产方为重点，全面抓小麦管理。全县范围内开展红旗竞赛。万亩万斤丰产区的流动红旗，已经评比了十一次。在开展竞赛的同时，还实行责任制。采取包领导、包产量、包指标、包工分；定任务、定措施、定劳力、定质量、定时间。任务指标到田、技术措施到田、检查验收到田。　　　　　（张励中）
    本报郑州23日电　河南省孟县人民鼓足更大干劲，重新修订指标，措施加码。由原订全县小麦平均亩产一千二百斤争取二千斤，修订为保证三千斤，并有两个三千五百斤社，六个三千斤社，一百二十个五千斤方和万亩万斤田。
    根据当前全县的小麦生长情况，实现这一宏伟的指标是完全有条件有根据的。去年孟县已经积累了丰富的小麦丰产经验。小麦已经胜利度过播种关和冬季管理关。到2月16日止，全县三十万亩小麦已经做到二肥三水，其中有二十万亩三肥三水；五万二千亩四肥四水；一万一千亩达到五肥五水。麦苗普遍茂密茁壮，嫩绿喜人。根据检查算账，七万二千亩卫星田每亩分蘖已达二百万株左右，每穗按四十粒计算，平均亩产可达到五千三百斤；十一万亩丰产田每亩已分蘖一百五十万株，单产可达四千斤；十一万八千亩一般田，每亩分蘖八十万株以上，单产可达到二千一百三十斤。按目前情况计算，全县小麦平均亩产可以达到三千二百四十斤。
    为了确保小麦丰产指标的实现，以冲天干劲和科学管理相结合的精神，采取六大措施：第一、政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。结合整社和生产，反复宣传党的八届六中全会决议。并且开展大鸣大放大辩论，批判在麦田管理中的自满情绪和右倾保守思想。发扬大干巧干的精神，树立敢想敢干和科学分析相结合的风格，迅速掀起一个户户出动、人人上阵的麦田管理运动。第二、肥料挂帅，兴修水利，保证小麦吃饱喝足。春季要积粗肥二百五十亿斤，造土化肥六千万斤，2月份以前要完成一半，并且边积边施，大积大施。从现在到麦收一般要做到三肥三水，丰产田五肥五水，卫星田七肥七水。第三、抓两头带中间，扩大一类苗，提高二类苗，消灭三类苗，保证块块长好，亩亩丰收。第四、做好对霜、雹、虫、风、病小麦的五大灾害的预防工作。社社建立病虫测报站，方方建立病虫测报组，队队设立测报员，五天一检查，十天一汇报。为了防止小麦倒伏，要早浇返青水，迟浇拔节水。多上草木灰，体外施钾肥。适时镇压，控制陡长。在拔节后，根据麦苗生长情况，在麦田里竖柱加网、防止倒伏。第五、大搞工具改革，提高劳动效率。3月初实现全县运输车子化，滚珠轴承化，达到一户一辆车，运输不挑担。并且大量制造收割机、打场机等工具，解决收割季节劳力不足的困难。第六、书记挂帅、加强领导，大搞丰产方，建立责任制。为了加强丰产方的领导，县成立小麦丰产指挥部，各公社成立小麦丰产指挥所。丰产方设立指挥台，建立麦田管理档案。并且按方固定专业队，建立责任制，做到路路有帅、方方有将、块块有兵、人人有责、点点不漏，亩亩丰产。运用干部、群众、技术三结合的方法，管好卫星指挥田，指导全面。并且在全县掀起社与社、方与方、人与人的红旗竞赛运动。（方徨）
