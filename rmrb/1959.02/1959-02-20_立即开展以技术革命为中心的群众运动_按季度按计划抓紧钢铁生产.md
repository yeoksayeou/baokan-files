Xinhua News Agency, 19th - The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, at a production telephone conference held on the 14th, called on all steel production workers nationwide to exert full effort and immediately launch a mass production movement centered on technical revolution. This is to ensure the completion of this year's target of 18 million tons of steel and all corresponding steel production tasks, starting with the first quarter's production tasks. In the days since the telephone conference, metallurgical departments and enterprises in many provinces, cities, and autonomous regions are mobilizing the masses of workers to discuss production plans and take emergency measures to address key production issues.

The conference was attended by the heads of metallurgical industry departments (bureaus) of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, as well as key steel enterprises. When analyzing the current state of steel production, the conference pointed out that although the national output of steel, iron, and steel materials from January to the first half of February has increased compared to the same period last year, it is important to note that the production of steel, iron, and steel materials has not yet reached the production level required by the national plan for the first quarter of this year. The conference called on cadres and workers in all provinces, cities, and enterprises to further exert their efforts, seize the opportunity, and immediately reverse the current situation, achieving a great leap forward in production in late February or early March.

The conference pointed out that in order to rapidly increase steel production, the following key measures must be taken quickly:

First, strengthen the organizational and ideological leadership of steel production, launch a mass movement centered on technical revolution, and immediately mobilize the masses of workers to discuss plans, tap potential, and take measures to address key production issues. Enterprise leaders are required to focus on grasping daily production levels, carrying out various production organization tasks, and going deep into workshops and in front of furnaces to lead this work.

Second, all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions are required to rapidly increase pig iron production. This is the primary key to current steel production. All localities are required to immediately carry out various preparatory tasks to ensure that various small blast furnaces are quickly put into production. At the same time, large and medium-sized blast furnaces are required to further increase their utilization coefficient. To increase pig iron production, it is necessary to concentrate efforts on grasping the production and construction of raw materials such as coke, washed coal, refractory materials, ore, and ferroalloys. The "No. 2" simple coke ovens currently under construction in various regions must be put into production around March.

Third, all regions are required to focus on putting converters into production, ensure their supply of raw materials, and improve technical operating skills, striving for converters to produce more steel and better steel.

Fourth, all regions are required to focus on the quality of steel, iron, and steel materials. To this end, it is necessary to produce in accordance with product standards and improve various operating procedures and technical inspection systems to ensure the quality of various products.

The conference emphasized that timely transporting qualified pig iron according to the national plan to support steelmaking in key steel enterprises and casting in mechanical departments is an important link in rapidly increasing steel production and equipment manufacturing. All provinces, cities, and autonomous regions are required to quickly take effective measures in accordance with the spirit of "the whole nation as one chessboard" to prioritize the completion of pig iron transfer plans.

    立即开展以技术革命为中心的群众运动
    按季度按计划抓紧钢铁生产
    新华社19日讯　冶金工业部在14日召开的生产电话会议上，号召全国钢铁生产职工鼓足干劲，立即开展一个以技术革命为中心的群众生产运动，保证完成今年一千八百万吨钢和与此相适应的全部钢铁生产任务，首先是第一季度的生产任务。电话会议以后的这几天，许多省、市、自治区的冶金部门和企业，正纷纷发动职工群众，讨论生产计划，并针对生产关键问题，采取紧急措施。
    参加会议的有各省、市、自治区冶金工业厅（局）和各重点钢铁企业的负责人。会议分析当前钢铁生产情况时指出，从今年1月到2月上半月，全国钢、铁、钢材的产量虽比去年同期有所提高，但是值得严重注意的是，目前钢、铁、钢材的生产，还没有达到今年第一季度国家计划要求的生产水平。会议要求各省、市和各企业职工进一步鼓足干劲，抓紧时机，立即扭转目前的局面，在2月下旬或3月上旬内在生产上来一个大跃进。
    会议指出，为了迅速提高钢铁生产，目前必须迅速采取以下主要措施：
    第一，抓紧对钢铁生产的组织领导和思想领导，开展以技术革命为中心的群众运动，针对生产中的关键问题，立即发动职工群众，讨论计划，挖掘潜力，采取措施；要求企业领导干部着重抓紧日的生产水平，进行各项生产组织工作，并且深入车间、炉前，领导这一工作。
    第二，要求各省、市、自治区迅速提高生铁产量。这是目前钢铁生产中的首要关键，要求各地立即进行各种准备工作，保证各种小高炉迅速开炉生产；同时要求大、中型高炉进一步提高利用系数。为了提高生铁产量，目前必须集中力量，抓紧焦炭、洗煤、耐火材料、矿石、铁合金等原材料的生产与建设，各地正在建设的“二号”简易焦炉，必须争取在3月前后全部投入生产。
    第三，要求各地抓转炉的开炉生产，保证它们的原材料供应和提高技术操作水平，争取转炉多出钢，出好钢。
    第四，要求各地抓钢、铁和钢材的质量，为此，就必须按产品标准进行生产，并且健全各种操作规程和技术检查制度，以保证各种产品质量。
    会议强调指出，按照国家计划及时调运合格的生铁，支援各重点钢铁企业炼钢和机械部门的铸造，是当前迅速提高钢铁生产和设备制造的重要环节，要求各省、市、自治区根据“全国一盘棋”的精神，迅速采取有效的措施，优先完成生铁外调计划。（附图片）
