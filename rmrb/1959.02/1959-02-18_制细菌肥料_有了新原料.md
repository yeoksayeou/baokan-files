Bacterial Fertilizer Production: New Raw Materials

(Our newspaper, Chongqing, 17th dispatch) Teachers and students of the Southwest Agricultural College have diligently researched and successfully experimented with using soil leachate as a culture medium for producing bacterial fertilizer and using bran (or rice bran) instead of cottonseed cake for producing antibiotic fertilizer. The common characteristic of these two manufacturing methods is that the raw materials are easy to find, and the equipment and operation methods are relatively simple. Currently, more than 300 rural technical cadres in various special districts and counties in Sichuan Province have learned these two methods and are preparing to promote them widely.

Ordinarily, the production of bacterial fertilizer first requires the use of relatively expensive and scarce chemical fertilizers to make a synthetic culture medium. Now, the method successfully tested by the teachers and students of the Southwest Agricultural College only requires muddy water and sugar to make a culture medium. Using wheat bran (or rice bran) instead of cottonseed cake can solve the raw material problem for producing antibiotic fertilizer in non-cotton-growing areas.

    制细菌肥料
    有了新原料
    本报重庆17日电　西南农学院师生刻苦钻研，已试验成功用土壤浸提液做培养基制造细菌肥料和用麸（或米糠）代替棉籽饼制造抗生菌肥料。这两种制造方法的共同特点，是原料来源易找，设备和操作方法比较简便。目前四川省各专、县已有三百多个农村技术干部学会了这两种方法，准备普遍推广。
    普通做细菌肥料先要用价格较贵、来源不多的化学肥料等做成合成培养基。现在西南农学院师生试验成功的办法只要用泥巴水加糖就能做成培养基。用麦麸（或米糠）代替棉籽饼，可以解决非植棉地区制作抗生菌肥料原料问题。
