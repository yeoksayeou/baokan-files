    Can People Eliminate and Create Objective Laws?

    "Theoretical Front" monthly magazine published an article in its ninth issue of 1958 by De Lin entitled "Give Play to the Power of the Superstructure to Prepare Conditions for the Transition to Communism." The author put forward the argument in the article that people can eliminate "objective laws" and inappropriately exaggerated the role of the superstructure. The article attracted the attention of readers after it was published. According to a report in the Yangtze Daily, the Wuhan Philosophical Society held a symposium on January 23. The participants unanimously agreed that the article exaggerated people's subjective initiative to the point of omnipotence, and in fact had fallen into the quagmire of subjective idealism. Everyone believed that people's subjective initiative has a huge role in transforming the objective world, but it can never eliminate objective laws. De Lin believes that people can "eliminate" laws by "eliminating" the "prerequisites" for the generation of certain laws. This confuses the "elimination" of the laws themselves with artificial "elimination." Objective laws can lose their function and give way to new laws, but this is the result of changes in the function of the objective laws themselves, not the result of people "creating" and "eliminating" them. People's subjective dynamic role is closely linked with objective laws. The so-called subjective initiative is the "correct ideas" and "correct actions" that Chairman Mao said, that is, ideas and actions that conform to objective laws. People's subjective initiative cannot only not "eliminate" objective laws, but also cannot be separated from objective laws in any step. If people want to give full play to their subjective initiative, they must add a high degree of revolutionary drive under the premise of obeying objective laws. Therefore, the more people conform to objective laws, the greater the dynamic role they play. As for the role of the superstructure, everyone believes that the superstructure has a huge role in the formation, consolidation and development of the economic base, and it can also play a decisive role under certain conditions, but it is always determined by the economic base and always based on objective economic conditions and plays its role according to objective laws. De Lin mistakenly believes that it seems that after the Party led the proletariat to seize power and establish a socialist economic base, it can ignore the level of development of the productive forces and objective economic laws; it seems that the Party only needs to strengthen ideological education, issue instructions and calls, to create conditions for the transition to communism. And they do not understand that the fundamental reason why our Party can play a huge role in these areas is that all our actions and measures proceed from objective economic conditions and conform to objective laws.

    人能消灭和创造客观规律吗？
    “理论战线”月刊1958年第九期曾经刊载了德麟的“发挥上层建筑的力量为过渡到共产主义准备条件”的文章。作者在文章中提出了人能够消灭“客观规律”的论点，并且不适当地夸大了上层建筑的作用。文章发表后曾引起了读者的注意。根据长江日报报道，武汉哲学学会于1月23日召开了座谈会，与会者一致认为这篇文章把人的主观能动性夸大到无所不能的程度，实际上已陷入了主观唯心主义的泥坑。大家认为人的主观能动性对改造客观世界是具有巨大作用的，但它绝不能消灭客观规律。德麟认为人可以通过“消灭”产生某种规律的“前提”来“消灭”规律，这是把规律自身“消灭”与人为的“消灭”混为一谈了。客观规律可以失去作用让位给新的规律，但这是客观规律本身作用发生变化的结果，不是人去“创造”和“消灭”的结果。人的主观能动作用是和客观规律密切联系在一起的。所谓主观能动性，就是毛主席所说的“正确的思想”和“正确的行动”，即符合客观规律的思想和行动。人的主观能动作用，不但不能“消灭”客观规律，而且一步也离不开客观规律，人要充分发挥主观能动作用，必须在服从客观规律的前提下加上高度的革命干劲。因此人越符合客观规律，能动作用发挥的就越大。至于上层建筑的作用问题，大家认为上层建筑对于经济基础的形成、巩固与发展是具有巨大的作用的，在一定的条件下还可以起决定性的作用，但它始终是为经济基础所决定，始终要以客观经济条件为基础，依据客观规律而发挥作用。德麟却错误地认为，似乎党在领导无产阶级夺取了政权、建立起社会主义经济基础之后，就可以忽视生产力发展水平和客观经济规律；似乎党仅仅只要加强思想教育、发布指示和号召，就能创造出准备向共产主义过渡的条件。而不知道我们党之所以能在这些方面发挥巨大的作用，其根本原因在于我们的一切行动措施都是从客观经济条件出发，符合客观规律的。
