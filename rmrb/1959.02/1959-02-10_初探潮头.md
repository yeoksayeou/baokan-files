    First Exploration of the Crest of the Wave

    What is the current situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country? The answer is: the momentum is like a spring tide, with waves rising step by step. It is certain that an even greater production upsurge will appear across the country in 1959.
    Looking at the countryside, the crest of the wave is clearly visible:
    The masses are full of confidence in achieving high production increases. First, there is the proof of last year's bumper harvest; second, there is the guarantee of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture (this is the culmination of agricultural high-yield experience). All the soldiers of the agricultural army have liberated their minds and are full of energy. "We can achieve high yields!" Everyone says in unison, without any doubt.
    The masses have high production enthusiasm and great energy. First, politics is in command, and socialist consciousness and the enthusiasm for building socialism have greatly increased; second, production has increased, living standards have improved, and there is even greater hope for this year, so how could the energy not be great! The momentum of thousands of troops and horses appearing in the manure collection movement is a sign. The Party's resounding call for implementing the four major targets, the cadres' deeper immersion in the masses and reality, and the better combination of ideological education and material rewards are like adding fuel to the fire, making the masses' enthusiasm higher and their initiative stronger.
    However, confidence, enthusiasm, energy, etc., are only one aspect. Whether there can be a greater harvest also depends on whether the strength is sufficient.
    The consolidation and improvement of the people's communes, and the more powerful organization of the agricultural industrial army. It has always been said: "Those who gain the people prosper," and "Many hands make light work," these are the most basic aspects. But this is not enough; there is also a need for more methods and measures to better deploy and use the vast labor force in the countryside and unleash greater potential.
    Doing things all at once can boost morale, increase ambition, and enhance energy, which is good, but if the allocation is not flexible and the arrangements are inappropriate, it will waste manpower. Therefore, in addition to concentrating manpower for shock attacks, we must also be good at dispersing and arranging various labor tasks. In the greater leap forward, the most valuable thing is manpower, which needs to be carefully calculated.
    Proper scheduling can make one person equal to a hundred or a thousand. Don't believe it? Look at the manure collection movement. Haven't various places already come up with many good methods? Organizing specialized teams, setting quotas, rationally deploying and allocating manpower, and tapping the potential of manpower are precisely the efforts to solve this aspect of the problem.
    In terms of improving labor efficiency, what is more important is to reform tools. Before the full realization of agricultural mechanization, engaging in tool reform on a large scale by thousands of troops and horses is the fastest and greatest way to see results, and it is also the easiest thing for everyone to do. This is what is meant by skillful work. Just look at how people are solving the tool problem in the manure collection and transportation process. In mountainous areas, there are even "earth airplanes" and "mountain automobiles" appearing. When everyone works together, hundreds of millions of people will be equal to tens of billions of people. Wouldn't the problem be solved then?
    Everyone should have a spirit. Spirit is "boiling with enthusiasm," it is confidence, energy, it is ideological awareness; strength is methods, measures, tools, with material things as the foundation. The more sufficient the spirit, the greater the strength; the greater the strength, the stronger the spirit. Complementing each other, we will be invincible. And our countryside is currently advancing on both fronts, side by side.
    Riding the crest of the wave and looking around, what a bright and splendid scene!

    初探潮头
    铁衣
    目下全国大跃进的形势若何？答曰：势如春潮涌，波澜步步高。1959年将在全国范围内出现一个更大的生产高潮，是无疑的了。
    举眼看农村，潮头历历在目：
    群众高额增产的信心十足。一有去年的丰收作证；二有八字宪法作保（这是农业丰产经验之大成）。农业大军的全体将士们，人人思想解放，干劲十足。“能够高产！”亿众同声，毫无疑议。
    群众的生产热情高，干劲大。一则政治挂了帅，社会主义的觉悟和建设社会主义的积极性大大高涨了；二则生产增加了，生活改善了，今年有更大的奔头，干劲怎的不大！积肥运动中出现的千军万马的气势，正是一个兆头。党的关于贯彻实现四大指标的响亮号召，干部的更加深入群众深入实际，思想教育同物质奖励更好的结合，正如釜底添薪，使群众的热气更高，积极性更旺。
    然而，信心、热情、干劲等等，只是一个方面，能不能有更大的丰收，还有一个力量够不够的问题。
    人民公社的巩固和提高，农业产业军的组织更加强有力了。从来说：“得人者昌”，“众人拾柴火焰高”，这是最基本的方面。但是还不足，还需要有更多的办法，更多的措施，以便把农村广大的劳动力调度使用得更好，发挥更大的潜力。
    作事都是一拥齐上，可以壮声势，长志气，增干劲，这是好的，但如果调配不灵，安排不当，就会浪费人力。因此，除了集中突击使用人力而外，还要善于分散安排各项劳动。在更大的跃进中，最宝贵的是人力，需要精打细算。
    调度得当，能够以一当百、当千。不信看积肥运动，各地不是已经想出了许多好办法了吗？组织专业队，搞定额，合理部署分配人力，挖掘人力上的潜力，这正是努力解决着这方面的问题。
    在发挥劳动效率上，更重要的是改革工具。在全面实现农业的机械化以前，千军万马大搞工具改革，见效最快也最大，而且这也是人人最容易动手作的事。这就是所说的巧干。试看积肥运肥中，人们正在动手解决工具，在山区里还有“土飞机”、“山区汽车”出现。大家一齐动手，几亿人就会等于几百亿人。问题岂不也就解决了吗？
    人人都应当有一股气。气，就是“热气腾腾”，是信心，干劲，是思想觉悟；力，就是办法，措施，工具，有物质的东西作基础。气越足，力越大；力越大，气越旺。相辅相成，无往不胜。而我们农村目前正是双管齐下、齐头并进着的。
    乘潮头举首四盼，真乃好一片光明灿烂的景象也！
