Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 3rd—To actively adapt to the needs of people's lives, the thousand-plus workers of the Jinan Match Factory are launching a Red Flag Week competition, fully tapping potential, and vigorously increasing match production. The daily match output in late January has reached about 1,900 cases, an increase of more than 35% compared to the average daily output in the fourth quarter of last year.

The Jinan Match Factory, which accounts for more than one-third of Shandong Province's match production, produced 548,200 cases of matches (1,000 boxes per case) in 1958. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has arranged an annual production plan and tapped potential from all aspects, including labor, equipment, and raw materials, organizing the masses of workers to carry out the Red Flag competition, rapidly improving labor efficiency.

Since late January, the manufacturing workshop has launched a production competition focused on improving the efficiency of machine-hours. The efficiency of each machine per hour in the entire workshop has increased from the original 4.8 cars (each 0.1 car is one case) to 5.1 to 5.2 cars. After implementing quick picking and quick packing, and reducing auxiliary time, the packing efficiency of some workers in the packaging workshop has increased by about half compared to the past; some fast box-packing (bagging) experts can now pack twelve to fourteen cases per shift. Workers in the splint-making workshop have adopted measures such as frequent sharpening of knives and strengthening the tray-setting operation during wood turning, which has improved the utilization rate of wood and reduced waste splints; at the same time, they have made full use of discarded splints to save wood.

    增产火柴
    济南火柴厂开展红旗竞赛
    新华社济南3日电　济南火柴厂的上千名职工，为积极适应人民生活需要，正在开展红旗周竞赛运动，充分挖掘潜力，大力增产火柴。1月下旬的火柴日产量已达到一千九百件左右，比去年第四季度的平均日产量提高35％以上。
    占山东省火柴产量三分之一以上的济南火柴厂，1958年生产了五十四万八千二百件火柴（每件一千盒）。今年以来，这个厂安排了年度生产计划，并从劳力、设备、原材料等各个方面挖掘潜力，组织职工群众开展红旗竞赛，迅速地提高了劳动效率。
    1月下旬以来，制造车间开展了以提高台时生产效率为中心的生产竞赛，全车间每台机器每小时的效率，已由原来的四点八车（每一点一车为一件）上升到五点一至五点二车。包装车间的工人，实行快拿快装，减少辅助时间后，部分工人的包装效率比过去提高了一半左右；一些快速装盒（袋）能手，一人一班已能装十二到十四件。制梗车间的工人，在旋材时采取了勤磨刀、加强摆盘操作等措施，提高了木材利用率，减少废梗；同时，把丢弃的梗子充分利用起来，节约木材。
