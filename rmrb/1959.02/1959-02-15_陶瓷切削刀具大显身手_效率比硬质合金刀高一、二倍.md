Ceramic cutting tools have achieved significant results since their promotion in Shenyang. More than thirty factories are now using them regularly in production. Factories such as the Machine Tool Plant No. 3, Pneumatic Tool Plant, Factory No. 53, and Transformer Plant have generally improved production efficiency by one to two times compared to using cemented carbide tools after adopting ceramic tools.

In November of last year, Machine Tool Plant No. 3 used a ceramic tool on an eight-foot belt lathe to process the intermittent cutting of the flat surface of a square tool holder (No. 45 forged steel). Additionally, the Mechanical Plant of Northeast Institute of Technology used a 1A62 lathe to process a rough shaft with a 6mm outer diameter runout at a speed of 1,200 revolutions per minute. In both cases, the ceramic tools performed well, dispelling the myth that ceramic tools are brittle and cannot withstand impact loads. This strengthened the confidence of workers in using ceramic tools. As a result, a wave of learning and promoting ceramic tools quickly swept across the city. Factory No. 53, the Institute of Silicate Research, Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant, and Liming Machinery Plant have all successfully manufactured high-quality ceramic inserts. According to the results of physical and mechanical performance tests and cutting tests conducted at Machine Tool Plant No. 1, the hardness, wear resistance, and cutting performance of the inserts manufactured by the Institute of Silicate Research have caught up with products from Shanghai.

Currently, the use of ceramic tools is expanding in the Shenyang area. For example, Machine Tool Plant No. 1 plans to adopt ceramic tools on 70%-80% of the lathes in the plant during the first quarter. Sixteen units in the city are manufacturing or preparing to manufacture ceramic tools. It is expected that ceramic cutting tools will play a significant role in this year's large-scale increase in the electromechanical industry.

    陶瓷切削刀具大显身手
    效率比硬质合金刀高一、二倍
    本报讯　陶瓷刀具在沈阳推广以来，已取得显著效果。现在已有三十多个工厂正常地用于生产。机床三厂、风动工具厂、五三工厂、变压器厂等工厂，使用陶瓷刀后，生产效率比使用硬质合金刀普遍提高一至二倍。
    去年11月，机床三厂在八呎皮带车床上加工四方刀台（45号锻钢）平面的断继切削，和东北工学院机械厂在1A62车床上以每分钟一千二百转的转速加工外径偏摆六公厘的毛胚轴时，陶瓷刀都能正常地胜任切削，破除了一些人认为陶瓷刀脆，不能承受冲击载荷的迷信，从而坚定职工们使用陶瓷刀的信心。于是，全市就立即掀起了学习和推广陶瓷刀的热潮。五三工厂、硅酸盐研究所、抚顺重型机器厂、黎明机械厂都先后制造成功质量良好的陶瓷刀片。硅酸盐研究所制造的刀片，根据在机床一厂作物理机械性能试验和切削试验的结果，硬度、耐磨性和切削性能等方面都已赶上了上海的产品。
    目前，陶瓷刀在沈阳地区的使用范围正在扩大。如机床一厂计划要在第一季度内全厂70％—80％的车床上采用陶瓷刀。该市已有十六个单位进行制造和准备制造陶瓷刀。预计陶瓷刀具将在今年机电工业大加番当中大显身手。
