    Ahead of the Spring Flood
    The first quarter is a crucial season for timber production. The Greater Khingan Range Forest Area of Inner Mongolia has made a very correct decision to complete more than half of this year's timber production plan in the first quarter. It is hoped that other forest areas will also seize the time to increase timber production for a greater leap forward in the national economy this year.
    Warm weather brings thawing and rising river water, which is a good time for floating timber. Seize this opportunity of a month or so to cut down as much timber as possible, and mobilize and organize the strength of the masses to rush all the cut timber to the streamside and riverside, waiting for the spring flood to float it away. This is an important link to ensure the victorious completion of the annual timber production plan.
    Forestry workers, mobilize! We must let the timber wait for the spring flood, not let the spring flood wait for the timber!

    赶在春水前面
    第一季度是木材生产的关键季节。内蒙古大兴安岭林区提出要在第一季度完成今年木材生产计划一半以上，是一个十分正确的决定。希望其他林区也都抓紧时间，为今年国民经济的更大跃进增产更多的木材。
    天暖解冻，河水上涨，是流放木材的好时机。抓紧这个把月的时间，尽量多采伐一些木材，并且动员和组织群众的力量，把采伐下来的木材全部抢运到溪旁河边，等待春水流放，这是保证全年木材生产计划胜利完成的重要环节。
    林业工人们动员起来！要让木材等春水，不让春水等木材！
