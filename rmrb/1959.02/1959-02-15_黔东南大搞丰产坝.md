In order to achieve large-scale high yields, the people of all ethnic groups in the Southeastern Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture have selected flat dams with better natural conditions within the autonomous prefecture and cultivated 590,000 mu of high-yield wheat and rapeseed dams. At present, these high-yield dams are lush green, and the crops are growing well.

Before liberation, most areas of the Southeastern Guizhou Autonomous Prefecture did not have the habit of planting wheat and rapeseed. After liberation, this gradually developed, and by 1958, the sown area reached 1.28 million mu. However, the yield was very low. The average yield per mu in 1958 was the highest in the past, but it was only 118 jin. In order to completely change the low-yield situation of wheat and rapeseed, the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture launched a vigorous campaign to develop high-yield dams, aiming to ensure a wheat yield of 1,000 jin per mu and a rapeseed yield of 500 jin per mu in the high-yield dams.

These high-yield dams have implemented a series of advanced cultivation methods and last year's high-yield experience from deep plowing, applying base fertilizer, sowing, topdressing, and irrigation. Currently, intensive weeding is underway. These 590,000 mu of high-yield wheat and rapeseed fields have been weeded twice, and some have even been weeded four times. The average topdressing is more than 10,000 jin per mu.

Since the sowing of wheat and rapeseed last year, there have been more than two months of drought without rain. All high-yield dams have undergone intensive irrigation and pest control. Some have diverted water and pumped water for irrigation. Some fields could not be irrigated, so the commune members carried water to irrigate the fields early and late. At the end of December last year, *Phyllotreta vittata* beetles were found in the rapeseed fields on the Chejiang high-yield dam in Rongjiang County. The commune members organized a clearing team of more than 500 people and eliminated the *Phyllotreta vittata* beetles in more than 1,000 mu of rapeseed fields within one day. Because the field management work was meticulous and scientific, the wheat and rapeseed are growing more vigorously than in any other year.

In order to ensure a bumper harvest in these high-yield dams and strengthen the leadership of the high-yield dams, each county party committee has specially appointed a standing committee member to be responsible for leading the high-yield dams. Some large dams have county committee members dedicated to leading them. Leading cadres participate in leadership and labor, which has powerfully promoted the production of high-yield dams.

    黔东南大搞丰产坝
    本报讯　黔东南苗族侗族自治州各族人民为取得大面积丰产，在自治州内选择了自然条件较好的平坝子，培植了五十九万亩小麦油菜丰产坝，目前，这块丰产坝一片葱绿，庄稼长得很好。
    黔东南自治州在解放以前，大部分地区没有种植小麦油菜的习惯。解放以后，逐步发展，到1958年播种面积达到一百二十八万亩，但产量很低，1958年平均亩产量是历年来最高的，但也只有一百一十八斤。为彻底改变小麦油菜的低产面貌，自治州各族人民掀起了大搞丰产坝运动，要确保丰产坝里的小麦亩产千斤，油菜亩产五百斤。
    这些丰产坝从深翻、施底肥、播种、追肥、灌溉都贯彻了一系列的先进耕作方法和去年的丰产经验。目前正进行着紧张的薅淋，这五十九万亩小麦油菜丰产田都已薅淋了二道，有的还薅淋了四道。平均每亩追肥一万多斤。
    从去年小麦油菜播种以后，有两个多月干旱无雨。各丰产坝都进行了紧张的浇灌和防虫。有的引水、抽水灌溉，有的田引不上去水，社员们就贪黑起早地担水浇。去年12月底榕江县车江丰产坝上油菜地发现猿叶虫，社员们组织了五百多人的清剿队，一天之内消灭了一千多亩油菜田里的猿叶虫。由于田间管理工作做得细致而且科学，小麦油菜生长得比任何一年都茁壮。
    为确保这些丰产坝获得丰收，加强丰产坝的领导，各县县委都专设一名常委负责领导丰产坝，有一些大坝子上，都有县委委员专职领导。领导干部参加领导和劳动，有力地推动了丰产坝的生产。（肖明、潘玉国）（附图片）
