    Xiangjiang Machine Factory Establishes Motorcycle Club
    In order to carry out diverse sports activities and improve the health of its employees, the Xiangjiang Machine Factory recently established a motorcycle club, preparing to launch mass motorcycle sports activities in the factory.
    The motorcycle club of the factory has set up repair and coaching groups. The motorcycles used are all processed and repaired by sports enthusiasts in their spare time using scrap machine parts. The main method of carrying out the activities is to run training classes. The plan is to first have the factory's motorcycle club coaching group run a training class to cultivate a group of core members, and then have these core members run training classes in various workshops to popularize the sport.

    湘江机器厂建立摩托车俱乐部
    为了开展多种多样的体育运动，增进职工身体健康，湘江机器厂最近建立了摩托车俱乐部，准备在该厂开展群众性的摩托车运动。
    该厂的摩托车俱乐部，下设机修组和教练组，所用的摩托车，全都是体育积极分子在业余时间利用废料机件加工修理出来的，开展运动的主要方法是办训练班。计划先由厂摩托俱乐部教练组办一个训练班，培养一批骨干，然后由这些骨干在各车间开办训练班，进行普及。
