    Brief News
    Welcoming the Yellow River Bridge
    The Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory completed the manufacturing task of the Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge ahead of schedule in mid-February. This factory started manufacturing the Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge in July last year. It was initially expected to be completed in May this year, but the bridge construction site was scheduled to start building the bridge in May this year. Under these circumstances, the factory's technicians and workers mustered up their energy and dedication, doing everything possible to shorten the manufacturing period.
    Opening Alkali Lakes in Ice and Snow
    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is vigorously increasing the production of natural soda ash. Since the New Year, the Yikezhao League and Xilingol League have mined more than 103,000 tons of natural soda ash. Currently, two to three thousand people in these two regions are intensifying their mining efforts on the frozen alkali lakes. On the roads from various alkali lakes to nearby railway stations, camel caravans, wooden-wheeled carts, and rubber-tired vehicles transporting natural soda ash are continuously moving. It is estimated that by the end of March, the output of natural soda ash will surge to about 600,000 tons.
    Extracting Oil and Drawing Silk from Pine Needles and Cypress Leaves
    Various regions in Guizhou Province have extracted industrial oil, edible oil, and fragrance oil from nearly a hundred kinds of tree leaves such as pine, cypress, tung, and eucalyptus. Jinping County alone can extract 5 million jin of fragrance oil from Masson pine needles every year. The residue after oil extraction, after simple processing, is turned into fiber, which can be used to make rayon or artificial wool.
    Highest Liquor Yield Rate
    The Yantai Distillery in Shandong Province has created the highest national record for liquor yield rate. The average liquor yield rate of 16 fermentation tanks in four consecutive rows reached 60.07%, with an increase of 7.51 jin of 65-proof liquor per 100 jin of raw materials.
    Stone-Made Lathe
    Workers at the Jieshi Commune Machinery Factory in Lufeng, Guangdong, recently successfully trial-produced a stone lathe. Except for small screws and parts made of iron, the rest of this lathe is made of stone. After use, it has been proven that the effect is the same as that of iron lathes, and it can be used to manufacture ball bearing housings, blowers, large and small screws, and new agricultural tool parts.
    Instrument for Testing Watches
    The Beijing Electrical Engineering Research Institute and the Comprehensive Instrument Factory have jointly trial-produced a watch calibrator. When a watch is placed on this instrument, the sound of the watch is converted into electrical energy through a microphone, and then the operation of the watch is recorded through the transmission mechanism of the electromagnet and printing frame. People can immediately see whether the watch is accurate. If the watch is more than two seconds fast or slow in 24 hours, this instrument can detect it.

    迎接黄河架大桥
    山海关桥梁厂提前在2月中旬完成了郑州黄河大桥桥梁制造任务。这个厂从去年7月份开始制造郑州黄河大桥桥梁，当时预计要在今年5月份才能造成，但工地在今年“五一”就要开始架桥。工厂的技术人员和职工们在这种情况下，便鼓足了干劲和钻劲，千方百计地缩短制造日期。
    冰天雪地开碱湖
    内蒙古自治区大力增产天然碱。新年以后，伊克昭盟和锡林郭勒盟已采出天然碱十万三千多吨。现在这两个地方每天有两三千人正在冰天雪地的碱湖上加紧开采。从各个碱湖到附近火车站的道路上，运送天然碱的骆驼、木轮车、胶轮车络绎不绝，估计到3月底，天然碱产量将激增到六十万吨左右。
    松针柏叶榨油抽丝
    贵州省各地已用松树、柏树、桐树、桉树等近百种树叶分别提炼出工业用油、食油和香料油。仅锦屏一县每年就可用马尾松针提炼香料油五百万斤。炼油后的渣经过简单处理变成纤维，可制人造丝或人造羊毛等物。
    白酒最高出酒率
    山东烟台酿酒厂创造白酒出酒率全国最高纪录，连续四排十六个醱酵池平均出酒率达到百分之六十点零七，每百斤原料增产了六十五度的白酒七点五一斤。
    石头做的车床
    广东陆丰碣石公社机械厂职工，最近试用石头造车床成功。这种车床除小螺丝钉和零件是用铁做的以外，其他都是用石头打成的。经过使用证实效果和铁的一样，用它能制造滚珠轴承外壳、鼓风机、大小螺丝、新式农具零件等。
    测验手表的仪器
    北京市电工研究所和综合仪器厂合作试制成功手表校正仪。把手表放在这个仪器上，手表的声音即通过麦克风变成电能，然后再通过电磁铁及打印架等传动机构，把手表的运行情况记录下来，人们立刻可以看出手表走得准不准。如果手表在二十四小时内快慢相差两秒钟以上，用这个仪器都能测验出来。
