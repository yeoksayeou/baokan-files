    Between Teachers and Students
    By our reporter Zhu Zemin
    In Nankai University, a new type of teacher-student relationship is being established. Students respect teachers, teachers love students, teachers and students help each other sincerely and combine closely, and a style of teaching and learning from each other is growing.

    In the Student Dormitory
    With the ringing of the bell for class, I went to the Chinese Department to visit Professor Meng Zhisun, the director of the Classical Literature Teaching and Research Group. But I couldn't find him anywhere. Finally, I found him in the dormitory of the third-year students of this department.

    Professor Meng Zhisun, with his graying hair, was leaning over a desk with several young students, reading books. The teachers and students were all reading the works of the poet Li Bai and related biographical literature. Meng Zhisun told me: "Today is our fixed day for scientific research. Our teachers and students are all part of a scientific research group – the Li Bai Group. We will jointly study Li Bai's literary thought as a part of our research on the history of Chinese literary thought." The close cooperation between Professor Meng Zhisun and the young students has a history of more than a year. Last year, Meng Zhisun and the teachers of the Classical Literature Teaching and Research Group cooperated with more than one hundred students to compile more than 500,000 words of "Lectures on the History of Chinese Literature" and more than 600,000 words of "Selected Annotations of Works." If you add the classical literature reference materials together, there are about 2 million words in total.

    In the past, Meng Zhisun always engaged in scientific research behind closed doors for most of his life. Why is he now so enthusiastically working with students? He told me the following story: Last year, when he was engaged in large-scale scientific research, Meng Zhisun set a leap forward plan to complete the "Selected Annotations of Works of the Sui, Tang, and Five Dynasties" in three days. After setting the plan, he lay in bed at night and couldn't fall asleep. No matter how he calculated, he couldn't complete the annotation of 100,000 words in three days by himself. The next day, Meng Zhisun frankly told the students about his troubles, but the students said: "Teacher Meng, go ahead, we will help you with all our strength." The Party Branch also supported the cooperation between the professor and the students. As a result, they worked together to select, annotate, copy, discuss, and research. In less than three days, 100,000 words of works came out, and the quality was very good. This fact gave Meng Zhisun a great education. He truly realized the strength of the students in practice. Since then, Meng Zhisun's relationship with the students has changed. As he himself said: "I now feel that the students are close to me, and I am close to the students."

    Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend, Teachers and Students Improve Together
    The classroom was densely packed with people. This was Associate Professor Yang Yixiang of the History Department leading the second-year students in discussing the "Eastern Jin and Southern Dynasties" chapter in his "Chinese History" lecture. Many questions were raised, and people were eager to talk about various opinions. Sometimes, two people with sharply opposed views argued until their faces were red.

    After a heated discussion, the students felt that they had learned this chapter in a particularly solid and profound way. Associate Professor Yang Yixiang also felt that "each discussion improves me once." He excitedly told the reporter about the gains he had made from participating in this kind of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" discussion. When he first lectured on the "Eastern Jin and Southern Dynasties," he talked very little about the class evolution at that time. However, the students raised a series of questions during the discussion, such as: The Eastern Jin and Southern Dynasties were a period of development of large land ownership. What role did large land ownership play in the social production at that time? Were dependent farmers the main productive force at that time? Can Sun En of the Eastern Jin and Tang Yuzhi of the Southern Dynasties be regarded as peasant uprisings? … These questions were also not completely resolved for Yang Yixiang. Therefore, he was inspired and helped by the students' discussions, and then went to consult historical materials and literature, and finally solved the problems. Both teachers and students were improved.

    Now, Yang Yixiang holds a discussion after lecturing on each chapter of "Chinese History." He firmly said: "I must be both a teacher of the students and a student of the students."

    The First Class of a New Teacher
    After the Organic Chemistry course for the third grade of the Chemistry Department was decided to be taught by the young female teacher Fang Sunan, not only Fang Sunan herself became busy, but also the old professors and students helped her together. On the day Fang Sunan rehearsed the first chapter, "Introduction," Professor Wang Jitao, the director of the Organic Chemistry Teaching and Research Group, Zhou Xiuzhong, the lecturer who originally taught Organic Chemistry, and representatives of the third-grade students all came to listen. After listening to the lecture, the old teachers and students enthusiastically pointed out the advantages and disadvantages of Fang Sunan's lecture and gave her specific help. The students thought that Fang Sunan's lecture was very good and ideologically strong, but also pointed out that some places were not prominent enough. Teachers and students also encouraged her not to panic when lecturing. With the help of the old teachers and students, Fang Sunan carefully researched and improved the content and method of the lecture. When she formally lectured, she was generally welcomed by the students.

    The success of the young teacher's first lecture made all the teachers and students excited. Gao Zhenheng, the deputy director of the Chemistry Department who was on a business trip in Shanghai, wrote a letter to congratulate her after hearing the news. The students also cared more about and helped the young teacher. Based on their feelings in the classroom, they told the teacher every bit of their opinions. With help from all sides, Fang Sunan said with confidence: "Next semester, I will teach the Organic Chemistry course better, and I will also compile new Organic Chemistry lectures."

    Professor's "Course Group Meeting"
    Since the establishment of the "Course Group Meeting" in the Polymer Teaching and Research Group of the Chemistry Department, it has insisted on holding meetings once a week. This "Course Group Meeting" is composed of the Party Branch Secretary, the person in charge of the Teaching and Research Group, and student representatives, and has become the core of leading the Polymer Chemistry course.

    The content of the "Course Group Meeting" is very broad, including students' learning situation, students' opinions and suggestions for improvement on teachers' lectures, students' requirements for teachers, and teachers' requirements for students, etc. In this way, teachers and students can often communicate their thoughts and understand each other's requirements and opinions, twisting into one rope and working together to improve the teaching work. Speaking of this, Professor He Binglin, the head of the Polymer Teaching and Research Group, felt deeply. He said: "In the past, teachers taught without caring whether students understood or not, and students did not care much about helping teachers. Now it is different. When students have difficulties in learning, I always want to go to the student dormitory to tutor them. And when I have something to do, students rush to do it for me. A few days ago, I was rushing to write lectures, and the students, knowing this, went to my house to help me copy them, and even printed them out overnight. This kind of close and mutually helpful relationship between teachers and students was unimaginable in the past."

    师生之间
    本报记者　朱泽民
    在南开大学，新型的师生关系正在建立。生敬师，师爱生，师生互相赤诚帮助，密切结合，各抒己见，教学相长的风气正在成长。
    在学生宿舍里
    随着一阵上课的铃声，我到中文系去访问古典文学教研组主任孟志孙教授。可是到处找不到，最后跑到这个系三年级学生宿舍里才找到他。
    头发斑白的孟志孙教授正和几个年青学生伏在桌上看书，师生们都在阅读着诗人李白的著作和有关传记文献。孟志孙告诉我说：“今天是我们固定进行科学研究的日子，我们师生都是一个科学研究小组——李白小组的，我们要共同研究李白的文学思想，作为我们研究中国文学思想史的一个部分。”孟志孙教授和青年学生之间的密切合作关系，已经有一年多的历史了。去年，孟志孙和古典文学教研组的教师，曾和一百多名学生共同合作编写了五十多万字的“中国文学史讲义”，六十多万字的“作品选注”。如果把古典文学参考资料加在一起，总共有二百万字左右。
    孟志孙教授在他过去的大半生中，搞科学研究一向是闭户独思，现在为什么这样兴致勃勃地和学生们一起干呢？他谈了这样一个故事：去年在大搞科学研究的时候，孟志孙订了一个跃进计划，要在三天中完成“隋唐五代作品选注”。订完以后，晚上躺在床上，他翻来复去睡不着觉，无论怎样盘算，一个人在三天里也完不成十万字的选注工作。第二天，孟志孙把自己的苦恼对学生们坦率地讲了，可是学生却说：“孟老师，你干吧，我们全力帮助你”，党总支也支持教授和学生共同合作。结果他们一起动手选注、抄写、讨论、研究，不到三天时间，十万字的作品出来了，而且质量很好。这个事实，给了孟志孙很大的教育，他从实践中真正体会到了学生们的力量。从此，孟志孙和学生的关系改变了，正像他自己所说：“我现在感到学生对我亲，我也对学生亲了。”百家争鸣师生双进步
    教室里黑压压地坐满了人。这是历史系副教授杨翼骧领导着二年级学生在讨论他刚讲过的“中国史”中的“东晋南朝”一章。许许多多的问题提出来了，人们争着谈论各式各样的见解。有时，两个持有针锋相对见解的人，争得面红耳赤。
    经过一番热烈讨论以后，学生们感到这一章学得特别扎实深刻。而杨翼骧副教授也感到“讨论一次自己提高一次”。他兴奋地跟记者谈起了他参加这种百家争鸣讨论会的收获。在他第一次讲“东晋南朝”课的时候，对当时的阶级演变讲得很少。可是，学生们在讨论时就提出了一系列的问题，例如，东晋南朝是大土地所有制发展时期，大土地所有制对当时的社会生产起了什么作用？依附农是否是当时的主要生产力？东晋的孙恩和南朝的唐寓之算不算农民起义？……这些问题对杨翼骧来说，也是没有完全解决的。于是他从学生讨论中得到了启发和帮助，再去查阅历史资料和文献，终于把问题解决了，教师和学生都得到了提高。
    现在，杨翼骧在讲“中国史”的每一章以后，都要举行一次讨论会。他坚定地说：“我既要作学生的先生，又要作学生的学生。”
    新教师的第一堂课
    化学系三年级的有机化学课决定由年轻的女教师方苏南任教以后，不但方苏南自己忙碌起来，连老教授和学生们都一起帮助她。在方苏南试讲第一章“绪论”那一天，有机化学教研组主任王积涛教授、原来教有机化学课的讲师周秀中和三年级的学生代表都来听课。听完了课，老教师和学生们都热情地指出方苏南讲课的优缺点，给她以具体帮助，学生们认为方苏南这一课讲得很好，思想性强，但也指出有些地方讲得还不够突出。师生们也鼓励她讲课时不要慌乱。方苏南在老教师和学生的帮助下，从讲课内容到方法都认真进行了研究改进，当她正式讲课的时候就受到了学生们普遍的欢迎。
    年轻教师讲授第一堂课的成功，全体教师和学生都为之兴奋，因公出差在上海的化学系副主任高振衡听到了这个消息以后，还特地写信来向她祝贺；学生们也更加关心帮助年轻教师，他们根据自己在课堂听讲的感受，把一点一滴意见都告诉给老师。有了来自各方面的帮助，方苏南满怀信心地说：“下学期我要把有机化学课教得更好，还要编出新的有机化学的讲义来。”
    教授的“课程小组会”
    化学系高分子教研组自从建立“课程小组会”以后，一直坚持每周都要开会一次。这个“课程小组会”是由党支部书记、教研组负责人和学生代表组成的，成为领导高分子化学课的核心。
    “课程小组会”讨论内容是十分广泛的，包括学生学习情况、学生对教师讲课的意见和改进建议、学生对教师的要求和教师对学生的要求等等。这样，师生之间就能经常沟通思想情况和了解彼此间的要求、意见，拧成一股劲，一致努力把教学工作搞得更好。谈到这一点，高分子教研组主任何炳林教授的感触很深，他说：“过去教师教书根本不管学生懂不懂，而学生也不大关心帮助教师。现在不同了，学生们学习有了困难，我就总想着要到学生宿舍去辅导他们，而我有什么事情，学生也抢着替我作。前几天我在赶写讲义，学生们知道了，就到我家里去帮助我抄写，而且连夜突击印出来了。这种亲密互助的师生关系，过去是想也想不到的。”
