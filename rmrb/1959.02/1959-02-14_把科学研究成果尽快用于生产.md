    Put Scientific Research Results into Production as Quickly as Possible
    Shanghai Ten Scientific Research Units Closely Integrate Research Work with Production
    Academy of Agricultural Sciences Vigorously Organizes Research Work to Promote Animal Husbandry Development
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) Since last year, ten scientific research units under the central industrial departments in Shanghai have applied many scientific research results to production sectors such as steel, machinery, textiles, medicine, and agriculture, enabling the research results to take effect relatively quickly. For some research projects that are not yet fully mature, the research units have also taken various measures to strive to put them into production as quickly as possible.
    The research topics of these scientific research units are mostly proposed in response to the current key production issues. Their timely application to production has greatly improved the production efficiency of industrial sectors. For example, after the great leap forward in steel industry production, steel testing and analysis work could not keep up with the needs of production development. Researchers at the Shanghai Materials Science Research Institute successfully developed an automatic, express chemical analyzer, which promptly solved the problem of testing and analyzing steel. The Shanghai Textile Science Research Institute, in response to the contradiction between combing work lagging behind cleaning work in textile production, concentrated its efforts on successfully researching a new type of combing machine with an efficiency nearly twenty times higher than the old machine, changing the backwardness of combing work. Currently, this high-yield combing machine has been put into production. In terms of steel utilization, the manufacturing of precision instruments and meters, and the production of chemical materials, relevant scientific research units have also researched many new products and technologies, and they have been quickly promoted in the production sectors.
    During the research process, researchers from many units went to the countryside and factories to work and experiment with workers and technicians, shortening the time for research work to be applied to production and improving the quality of research work.
    Technicians from the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Research Institute and relevant design departments, along with workers and technicians from the factory, jointly researched a new method of continuous fermentation of streptomycin, increasing the fermentation potency from 2,000 units to 8,000 units. At the same time, the equipment design and production operation procedures for extracting vitamin B12 from waste liquid have also been basically completed, enabling this valuable drug to be put into production ahead of schedule.
    The leap forward in research work in these scientific research units is a major achievement of the rectification movement carried out last year. Through airing opinions, debates, and analysis of typical cases, scientific researchers criticized the bourgeois scientific research views and styles of only caring about scientific research and writing papers, disregarding production realities, and not applying research results to production. They actively launched scientific research and promoted the application of research results to production, changing the face of research work. The Shanghai Instrument and Meter Institute completed 109 research projects last year, most of which could be directly or indirectly applied to production. In the previous year, a total of 33 topics were researched, with 8 being successfully researched and only 1 being applied to production.
    Currently, these scientific research units are further summarizing last year's work experience and have decided to both complete new research topics more and faster this year and to promptly promote research results to production. Some units have also decided that each topic, from selection and research to promotion, will be contracted by a research team, making the combination of research work and production reality even closer.

    (Our newspaper's dispatch) The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences will vigorously organize national animal husbandry scientific research work this year to promote the rapid development of animal husbandry production.
    In order to specifically implement this task, the Animal Husbandry Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences recently held a meeting to discuss this year's animal husbandry scientific research work, with representatives from animal husbandry research departments and some schools across the country participating. The meeting mainly discussed how scientific research work can serve this year's great leap forward in animal husbandry production and serve the vigorous breeding of cattle and horses and the rapid development of pig, sheep, and poultry production. As a result of the discussion, the meeting preliminarily formulated more than 200 key research projects based on the key tasks related to animal husbandry stipulated in the 1959 Science and Technology Development Plan (Draft). The focus is on solving the most important technical problems in current animal husbandry production, such as striving for full fatness and pregnancy, multiple births and multiple births, increasing feed production, and improving the utilization rate of breeding males. For example, improving the reproduction rate of large livestock, sheep, and goats, rapid fattening of pigs, increasing wool, egg, and milk production, and research on commune feed land planting, etc. These key projects will be undertaken by animal husbandry scientific research departments or animal husbandry colleges in various places, or jointly researched by several departments.
    This year, animal husbandry scientists across the country will also exert soaring energy and cooperate with animal husbandry production and education departments to conduct investigations on local livestock breeds and the effects of crossbreeding improvement, propose livestock breed improvement plans, draw national livestock local breed distribution maps, compile national livestock fine breed atlases, and books such as Chinese Animal Husbandry.
    The meeting also requested animal husbandry research departments in various places to organize the compilation of small booklets on various animal husbandry technologies combining indigenous and foreign methods, and assist people's communes in carrying out mass animal husbandry scientific activities and solving new technical problems that arise in the development of collective animal husbandry.

    把科学研究成果尽快用于生产
    上海十个科学研究单位研究工作和生产紧密结合
    农业科学院为促进畜牧业发展大力组织研究工作
    本报讯　中央工业部门在上海的十个科学研究单位，从去年以来有许多项科学研究成果用于钢铁、机械、纺织、医药和农业等生产部门，使研究成果较快地产生了效果。有些不十分成熟的研究项目，各研究单位也采取了各种措施，争取尽可能快地用于生产。
    这些科学研究单位的研究课题，绝大多数是针对当前生产关键提出来的，它们及时用于生产后，大大地提高了工业部门的生产效率。如在钢铁工业生产大跃进后，钢铁化验分析工作跟不上生产发展需要，上海材料科学研究所的研究人员研究成功一种自动特快化学分析仪，及时解决了化验分析钢铁的问题。上海纺织科学研究院针对纺织生产中梳棉工作跟不上清花工作的矛盾，集中力量突击研究成功一种效率比老机器高过将近二十倍的新式梳棉机，改变了梳棉工作落后的现象。目前，这种高产量的梳棉机已经投入生产。在钢材的利用、精密仪器仪表的制造和化工材料的生产等方面，有关的科学研究单位也都研究出许多新产品、新技术，并且在生产部门很快加以推广。
    在进行研究的过程中，许多单位的研究人员下乡下厂和工人、技术人员一同劳动，一同做试验，缩短了研究工作用于生产的时间，提高了研究工作的质量。
    上海医药工业研究所和有关设计部门的技术人员及工厂的工人、技术人员共同研究成功一种链霉素连续发酵的新方法，使发酵的效价从两千单位提高到八千单位，同时，他们从废液中提取维生素B12的设备设计和制订生产操作规程的工作也基本完成，使这种贵重药品提前投入生产。
    这些科学研究单位的研究工作上的跃进，是去年开展整风运动的一项重大收获。通过鸣放、辩论和典型事例的分析，科学研究人员批判了只顾科学研究、写论文，不顾生产实际，不把研究成果用于生产等资产阶级的科学研究观点和作风，积极地展开科学研究和把研究成果推广到生产中去的活动，改变了研究工作的面貌。上海仪器仪表研究所去年完成了一百零九个研究项目，大多数研究成果都可以直接或间接地用于生产。而前年一共研究了三十三个课题，研究成功的有八个，用于生产的只有一个。
    目前，这些科学研究单位正在进一步总结去年的工作经验，并决定在今年工作中既要更多更快地完成新的研究课题，又要把研究成果及时地推广到生产中去。有的单位并决定每个课题，从选题、研究到推广，都由研究小组包下来，使研究工作和生产实际结合得更紧密。

    本报讯　中国农业科学院今年将大力组织全国畜牧科学研究工作，来促进畜牧生产的迅速发展。
    为了具体贯彻这项任务，中国农业科学院畜牧研究所在不久前召开了一次讨论今年畜牧科学研究工作的会议，有各地畜牧研究部门和一部分学校的代表参加。会议主要讨论科学研究工作怎样为今年畜牧生产大跃进服务，为大力繁殖牛、马，迅速发展猪、羊和家禽生产服务。讨论结果，会议根据1959年科学技术发展计划（草案）规定的有关畜牧的重点任务，初步拟定了二百多个重点研究项目。中心在于解决畜牧生产当前最重要的争取满膘满怀、多胎多产、增产饲料和提高种公畜利用率等方面的技术问题。例如，提高大家畜和绵羊、山羊的繁殖率、猪的快速肥育，提高羊毛、鸡蛋和牛乳产量，公社饲料地种植研究等等。这些重点项目，将分别由各地的畜牧科学研究部门或畜牧院校担任研究，或几个部门合作研究。
    今年全国的畜牧科学工作者还将发挥冲天干劲，和畜牧生产、教育部门合作进行地方畜种和杂交改良效果的调查工作，提出畜种改良方案，绘制全国家畜地方畜种分布图，编成全国家畜良种图谱和中国畜牧学等图书。
    这次会议还要求各地畜牧研究部门组织编写土洋结合的各项畜牧技术小册子，并协助人民公社开展群众性的畜牧科学活动，和解决发展集体养畜中出现的新技术问题。
