Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 21st: Construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's No. 2 Blast Furnace officially began at 4:50 PM on February 18th with the pouring of concrete for the hot stove foundation. The workers are determined to work diligently and cleverly under the direct assistance and guidance of Soviet experts to complete this large blast furnace as soon as possible. At the mobilization meeting, they proposed to "overtake Anshan and surpass Baotou" in terms of quality and construction speed.

The Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's No. 2 Blast Furnace is fully mechanized and automated, and adopts the latest smelting technology achievements such as steam blowing and high-pressure furnace tops. Many auxiliary projects of this blast furnace, such as water supply, power supply, material supply systems, and electrostatic dust removal, have been completed when the No. 1 Blast Furnace was put into production; now, the five major construction projects that need to be built are hot stoves, the blast furnace body, the iron tapping yard, the furnace top hoist room, and the dust collector. At present, a portion of the furnace shell of the hot stove has been pre-assembled, the foundation of the blast furnace body is being welded with bottom reinforcing bars, the furnace top hoist room has begun to install equipment, and the dust collector has also begun to support the formwork and tie the reinforcing bars.

In order to enable this blast furnace to join the ranks of fighting for eighteen million tons of steel as soon as possible, the workers have displayed soaring enthusiasm and are working against the clock. The installation of the wooden formwork for the hot stove foundation took eighteen days for the No. 1 Blast Furnace, but only five days for the No. 2 Blast Furnace. The binding of the reinforcing steel for the hot stove foundation has also been shortened from fifteen days to five and a half days. The workers in the three scaffolding groups challenged each other and completed six days' worth of work in one day.

    武钢二号高炉开工建设
    新华社武汉21日电　武汉钢铁公司的第二号高炉从18日下午四时五十分开始浇灌热风炉基础混凝土起，就正式开工了。工人们决心在苏联专家直接帮助指导下奋战巧干，尽快地建成这座大型高炉。他们在誓师大会上提出，在质量和施工速度方面，都要“赶过鞍钢超包钢”。
    武钢二号高炉全部是机械化、自动化操作，并采用了蒸汽鼓风、高压炉顶等最新的冶炼技术成就。这座高炉的许多附属工程，如供水、供电、供料系统和静电除尘等项目，在一号高炉投入生产时已经建成；现在需要建设的有热风炉、高炉本体、出铁场、炉顶卷扬机室、除尘器等五大工程项目。目前，热风炉已预先拼好了一部分炉壳，高炉本体的基础正在焊接底部钢筋，炉顶卷扬机室开始安装设备，除尘器也开始支撑模板和绑扎钢筋。
    为了使这座高炉早日参加为一千八百万吨钢而战的行列，工人们发挥了冲天干劲，分秒必争地施工。安装热风炉基础的木模，一号高炉用了十八天时间，二号高炉只用了五天时间。热风炉基础钢筋的绑扎工程，也由十五天缩短为五天半。搭脚手架的三个组的工人互相挑战，一天就完成了六天的任务。
