Showing Concern for the Masses in Every Matter, Providing Convenience for the Masses Everywhere
    Public Security Organs Decide to Carry Out "Love the People Month" Every Year During the Spring Festival

    (Our dispatch) To strengthen the ties between public security personnel and the people, the Ministry of Public Security, at the Ninth National Public Security Conference, passed a resolution to designate one month surrounding the Lunar New Year each year, starting from the 1959 Lunar New Year, as the "Love the People Month" for public security departments nationwide.

    The resolution pointed out: Under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, the cadres and people's police of our country's public security departments have a fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses and relying on the masses in completing the struggle against the enemy and various public security tasks. The vast majority of public security personnel have good political discipline and have established inseparable flesh-and-blood ties with the masses, thus earning the love of the people. To continuously consolidate and promote this tradition, it has been decided to designate one month before and after the Spring Festival each year as the "Love the People Month" for public security departments at all levels. A comprehensive and widespread inspection and ideological education will be conducted on adherence to policies and discipline. Model individuals and advanced units that have performed well in implementing policies and discipline should be commended promptly; those with poor discipline and work style should be criticized and educated. Great emphasis should be placed on caring for the suffering of the masses, alleviating their difficulties, paying attention to providing convenience for the masses in various tasks, proactively solving problems for the masses, and doing more good deeds for the masses. Through this inspection and education, all cadres and police will be infinitely loyal to correctly implement the Party's policies, abide by national laws and public security work discipline, and fully establish the thinking of being ruthless to the enemy, gentle internally, and wholeheartedly serving the people. This will ensure showing concern for the masses in every matter, providing convenience for the masses everywhere, integrating with the people, and implementing the mass line work style.

    The resolution stated: In view of the fact that public security organs at all levels have frequently carried out this kind of work in the past few years and have already gained a set of disciplinary contents that should be constantly noted in practice, the Ninth National Public Security Conference has specially summarized the experiences of various regions and formulated unified "Eight Disciplines and Ten Points for Attention" that should be frequently observed by public security personnel nationwide, requiring all public security personnel to memorize them and abide by them.

    Public security departments in Guangdong, Anhui, Gansu, and other provinces and cities have already enthusiastically launched "Love the People Month" activities before the Spring Festival. Other provinces and cities are also preparing to widely launch this activity after the Spring Festival.

    事事关心群众　处处便利群众
    公安机关决定年年春节开展爱民月
    本报讯　为了密切公安人员同人民群众的联系，中央公安部召开的第九次全国公安会议上曾经作出决议，决定从1959年旧历春节开始，将每年春节的一个月作为全国公安部门的“爱民月”。
    决议指出：我国公安部门的干部和人民警察，在各级党和政府的领导下完成对敌斗争和各项治安任务中，是具有密切联系群众、依靠群众的优良传统的。广大公安人员的政治纪律性也是良好的，他们同群众建立了血肉不可分的联系，因而取得了人民群众的爱戴。为了使这种传统得以不断巩固和发扬，决定把每年春节前后的一个月作为各级公安部门的“爱民月”。对遵守政策、纪律进行一次总的广泛检查和思想教育。对于执行政策纪律良好的模范人物与先进单位，要及时予以表扬；对于纪律作风不好的要给以批评教育。并大大提倡关心群众痛苦，解除群众困难，在各项工作中注意便利群众，主动地为群众解决问题，为群众多办好事。通过这个检查和教育使所有干部和民警无限忠诚地正确执行党的政策，遵守国家法律和公安工作纪律，充分树立对敌要狠，对内要和，全心全意为人民服务的思想。做到事事关心群众，处处便利群众，同人民群众打成一片，贯彻群众路线作风。
    决议说：鉴于过去几年来，各级公安机关都经常进行这种工作，已经在实践中摸到了一套经常应当注意的纪律内容，第九次全国公安会议特综合各地经验，制定了为全国公安人员应当经常遵守的统一的“八大纪律、十项注意”，要求全体公安人员人人熟记，个个遵行。
    广东、安徽、甘肃等省市的公安部门，已经在春节前热烈展开了“爱民月”的活动。其它各省市也准备春节后普遍展开这一活动。
