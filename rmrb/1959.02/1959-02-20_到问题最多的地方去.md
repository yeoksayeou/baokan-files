    Go to the Places with the Most Problems
    The Xianfeng People's Commune in Yicheng, Shanxi, recently discovered during a spring plowing preparation inspection that the Xiguan Brigade in the town's management area had several problems in its preparatory work: livestock were weak and lacked over 40,000 jin of fodder; fertilizer was also lacking; farm tools were not under the care of designated personnel, and over 800 pieces needed repair and addition; seed preparation was even worse, with only 4,000 jin of cotton seeds available out of the 15,000 jin needed, and all 400 jin of reserved sweet potato seeds had rotted.
    The commune Party committee studied these situations and quickly sent people to specifically help this team launch spring plowing preparations.
    They simultaneously mobilized commune members to apply fertilizer to wheat fields and extracted half of the 150-plus male and female laborers in the team to form a manure accumulation army for a crash effort to accumulate manure. They have already identified ten ways to accumulate fertilizer, and can accumulate enough for over 14,000 cartloads before spring plowing, exceeding the amount of base fertilizer needed for spring sowing. They also extracted twenty strong laborers to go up the mountains to cut wild grass (for feeding livestock), completing 32,000 jin before the Spring Festival. Regarding livestock management, they adopted "extraordinary measures," with Party branch committee member Lu Chengzhi taking full responsibility, adding two more feeders and a feeding pen, and improving management methods, requiring the elimination of the three types of weak livestock before spring plowing.
    On January 20th, they also extracted carpenters Wang Shilin and Chang Haoli, and blacksmith Yi Fangzhen, requiring them to repair more than 130 pieces of farm tools, such as carts, deep plows, small livestock yokes, and small saddles, within fifteen days. In addition to carefully selecting and sunning existing seeds, they also planned to exchange good quality cotton seeds and sweet potato seedlings with other teams.
    All other management areas in the commune are also taking emergency measures to vigorously grasp spring plowing preparations.

    到问题最多的地方去
    山西翼城先锋人民公社，最近从春耕准备工作检查中，发现城内管理区西关大队在备耕中存在的问题比较多：牲口瘦弱，还缺饲草四万多斤；肥料也缺；农具没有专人保管，需要修理增添的有八百多件；种籽的准备更差，共需棉种一万五千斤，现在才有四千斤，原备有留种红薯四百斤全坏了。
    公社党委会研究了这些情况，赶快派人去具体地帮助这个队展开春耕准备活动。
    他们一面发动社员在麦田追肥，一面在全队一百五十多个男女劳力中抽出一半组成积肥大军，突击积肥。已经找出十种积肥门路，春耕前可积足一万四千车，超过春播所需的底肥数。还抽出二十个强劳力，上山割野草（喂牲口用），春节前已完成三万二千斤。对于牲口管理，采取了“非常措施”，由党支部委员卢承志包干负责，并增加了两个饲养员、一处饲养圈，改进了管理方法，要求春耕前消灭三类牲口。
    1月20日，他们又抽出木匠王世林、常好礼和铁匠伊方贞三人，要求在十五天内，修好大车、深耕犁、小型牲口辕架及小鞍子等一百三十多件农具。除了对现有种籽进行精选翻晒外，还准备和其他队调换优良棉籽和甘薯种。
    全社其他各管理区，也都在采取紧急措施，大抓春耕准备工作。
