Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st: The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a telephone conference for all regions and municipal committees in the province on the evening of the 18th, calling on Party organizations at all levels, the vast number of workers on the iron and steel front, and the people of the province to take immediate action to vigorously increase ironmaking production.

The Shanxi Provincial Committee pointed out that the state has given Shanxi Province a large steel production task this year, but as long as pig iron production catches up, the steelmaking task can be completed. In terms of ironmaking, the province now has 2,180 cubic meters of ironmaking equipment in production, and the potential of this equipment is still great. After last year's mass campaign to produce iron and steel, more than 200 small indigenous ironmaking plants have emerged throughout the province. A large number of large, medium, and small blast furnaces have already begun construction. These are all favorable conditions. As long as all comrades exert sufficient effort, vigorously mobilize the masses, increase the utilization coefficient of existing ironmaking blast furnaces, accelerate the construction progress of new blast furnaces and other corresponding projects, and expand the construction scale of the ironmaking system on the basis of small indigenous groups, so that the ironmaking enterprises of small indigenous groups can quickly be upgraded to small modern groups, we will certainly be able to fulfill the iron and steel production plan well.

Regarding the issue of increasing the utilization coefficient of existing ironmaking blast furnaces, the conference determined: (1) Mobilize the masses to formulate technical and economic norms, improve the output and quality of ore, coke, and refractory bricks, reduce the consumption of raw materials and fuel, and ensure that the blast furnaces are well-fed and well-nourished to achieve high quality and high yield. (2) Strengthen equipment maintenance and repair work. (3) Adjust the power equipment of small blast furnaces, increase the air volume, and vigorously solve the problem of short-distance transportation. (4) Widely mobilize the masses to carry out red flag competitions in the above-mentioned links, and summarize and promote advanced experience.

In terms of expanding the construction scale of the ironmaking system and accelerating the construction speed of new blast furnaces and other related projects, the conference determined: In addition to ensuring that the 253 large, medium, and small ironmaking blast furnaces that have already been determined for construction must be put into production in batches before the end of March and the end of June, it is also necessary to build hundreds of small modern blast furnaces with a total capacity of about 4,000 cubic meters, and all of them must be put into production before the end of July.

    全党动员抓生铁
    山西
    据新华社太原21日电  中共山西省委在18日晚召开全省各地、市委电话会议，号召全省各级党组织、钢铁战线上的广大职工和全省人民立即行动起来，大力提高炼铁生产。
    山西省委指出，今年国家给予山西省的钢铁生产任务很大，但是，只要生铁生产赶上去，炼钢任务就可以完成。在炼铁方面现在全省已有二千一百八十立方公尺的炼铁设备进行生产，而且这些设备的潜力还很大；经过去年全民大战钢铁，全省已出现二百多个小土群炼铁厂；全省有一大批大中小型的炼铁高炉已经开始建设。这些都是有利条件。只要全党同志鼓足干劲，大力发动群众，提高现有炼铁高炉的利用系数，加速新建高炉和其他相应工程的建设进度，并在小土群的基础上扩大炼铁系统的建设规模，使小土群的炼铁企业很快地提高为小洋群，就一定能够很好地完成钢铁生产计划。
    关于提高现有炼铁高炉的利用系数问题，会议确定：（一）发动群众制定技术经济定额，提高矿石、焦炭、耐火砖的产量和质量，减少原材料和燃料的消耗量，保证让高炉吃得饱、吃得好，达到优质高产。（二）加强设备维护和检修工作。（三）调整小高炉的动力设备，增大风量，大力解决短途运输问题。（四）在上述各个环节上广泛发动群众开展红旗竞赛，总结和推广先进经验。
    在扩大炼铁系统的建设规模和加快新建高炉和其他有关工程的建设速度方面，会议确定：除了保证原已确定建设的二百五十三座大中小型炼铁高炉，必须在3月底和6月底大部分分批投入生产以外，还要增建总容量达四千立方公尺左右的小洋高炉几百座，并且要在7月底以前全部投入生产。
