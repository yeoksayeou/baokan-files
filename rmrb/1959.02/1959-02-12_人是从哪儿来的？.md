    Where Did Humans Come From?
    One day in 1860, the Great Hall of Oxford University in England was packed with people who had come to attend a scientific discussion meeting on Darwin's book "On the Origin of Species" and to listen to a speech by the prestigious Bishop of the Oxford district.
    The discussion began, and the Bishop, with his characteristic solemn tone, recounted how God "created" mankind. Then he said:
    "At the end of my speech, I would like to ask Professor Huxley: What are his thoughts on the theory that humans evolved from monkeys? Does he believe that his paternal or maternal line is from monkeys?"
    The clergymen shouted hysterically, and the believers of God waved their white handkerchiefs vigorously, thinking that God had "won."
    Before the Bishop could step down, Darwin's friend Huxley was already speaking on the stage. He calmly said: "Darwin's theory is not an abstract fantasy, but uses scientific logic to connect a large number of biological facts. As for the question of whether humans evolved from apes, I will answer it this way: I am not ashamed to have originated from that poor animal that walks with a stoop and has undeveloped intelligence; I would be ashamed to have originated from those who claim to be very talented, have high social status, but arbitrarily interfere in things they are ignorant of and wantonly obliterate the truth!"
    These words were like a bucket of cold water, dousing the religious figures into silence. But it won the university students a burst of stormy applause.
    This scientific discussion ended with the believers of God being rendered speechless.
    Today is the 150th anniversary of the birth of Charles Robert Darwin (1809-1882), a great British scientist and the founder of the theory of biological evolution. After conducting thorough observations on biology, geology, anthropology, and other aspects during his global voyage, Darwin spent twenty years writing "On the Origin of Species" (1859), which proposed the famous Darwinian principle of the theory of biological evolution. Darwin proved that the animal species on Earth gradually developed from single-celled animals, and the ancestors of humans were anthropoid apes. This scientific discovery gave religion its most severe blow, so the religious figures of the time spared no effort to attack this new theory. The above record is just one round.
    The founders of Marxism gave Darwin's theory a high evaluation. Engels considered it one of the three major discoveries of natural science in the 19th century. Lenin also said: "Darwin overthrew the view that animal and plant species are unrelated, accidental, 'divinely created,' and immutable. For the first time, he placed biology on a completely scientific basis and established the variability and continuity of species" ("What are the 'Friends of the People' and How Do They Fight the Social Democrats?" Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 1, p. 122).
  However, regarding the theory that humans evolved from anthropoid apes, Darwin knew the "what" but not the "why." Engels solved this "enigma" – labor transformed apes into humans.

### 人是从哪儿来的？

    人是从哪儿来的？
    1860年的一天，英国牛津大学的大礼堂里被人们挤得水泄不通，他们都是来参加达尔文所著“物种起源”一书的科学讨论会，听取有名望的牛津区主教演说的。
    讨论会开始了，主教以特有的庄严语气讲述了上帝怎样怎样“创造”了人类。然后他说：
    “在我的演说结束时，我想请问赫胥黎教授：他对人是从猴子变来的学说有什么想法？他是不是认为，自己的父系或母系是猴子呢？”
    教士们歇斯底里地叫喊起来，神的信徒们使劲挥舞自己的白手绢，他们以为上帝“胜利”了。
    没等主教下台，达尔文的朋友赫胥黎就已经在讲台上发言了，他从容不迫地说：“达尔文学说并不是抽象的幻想，而是用科学的逻辑，把大量的生物学事实贯穿起来。至于说到人是从猿猴演化而来这个问题，我就这样答复：要是说我是起源于那弯着腰走路和智力不发达的可怜的动物，我并不觉得羞耻；要是说我是起源于那些自称很有才华、社会地位很高、却胡乱干涉自己所茫然无知的事物、任意抹煞真理的人，那才觉得可耻呢！”
    这一席话，像一桶冷水，泼得那些宗教家们噤若寒蝉。但却博得大学生们一阵阵暴风雨般的掌声。
    这次科学讨论会是以驳得上帝的信徒们哑口无言而宣告结束的。
  今天是英国大科学家、生物进化论创始人查理·罗伯特·达尔文（1809－1882）诞生一百五十周年的日子。达尔文在环球旅行中，就生物学、地质学、人种学等方面进行周密观察以后，用二十年时间写成了“物种起源”（1859）一书，提出了著名的生物进化论的达尔文主义原理。达尔文证明：地球上的动物种类，是从单细胞动物逐渐发展而来，人类的远祖就是类人猿。这一科学发现，给予宗教以一次最严重的打击，所以，当时的宗教家们都不遗余力地攻讦这个新学说。上面的那段记载只是一个回合。
    马克思主义创始人给予达尔文学说以很高的评价，恩格斯认为它是十九世纪自然科学三大发现之一。列宁也说：“达尔文推翻了那种把动植物种看做彼此毫无联系的、偶然的、‘神造的’、不变的东西的观点，第一次把生物学放在完全科学的基础上，确定了物种的变异性和承续性”（“什么是‘人民之友’以及他们如何攻击社会民主主义者？”列宁全集第一卷第122页）。
  但是，对于人类是从类人猿进化而来这一学说，达尔文知其然而不知其所以然。恩格斯解开了这个“哑谜”——劳动使猿变成人。
