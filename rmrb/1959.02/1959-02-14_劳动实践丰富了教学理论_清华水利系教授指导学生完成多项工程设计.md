Xinhua News Agency, February 13th: Six veteran professors in the Hydraulic Engineering Department of Tsinghua University, with the help of the Party organization and through their own efforts, have taken a step forward on the path of linking theory with practice in the past year.

The six professors are Zhang Ren, the head of the Hydraulic Engineering Department, Xia Zhenhuan, the deputy head, and Shi Jiayang, Li Piji, Chen Liangsheng, and Chen Zudong, who are the heads of various teaching and research groups. They are all experienced teachers with many years of teaching experience, but they originally lacked production experience to varying degrees. After more than ten months of effort last year, they have summarized a lot of production experience in leading students in production labor and have used it to enrich and improve theoretical teaching.

Zhang Ren and Shi Jiayang are currently working as the leaders of the design representative team (equivalent to the chief design engineer) at the Miyun Reservoir construction site. The design of this reservoir is being undertaken by the Hydraulic Engineering Department of Tsinghua University. After the project started construction in September last year, the Party organization of the Hydraulic Engineering Department sent Zhang Ren and Shi Jiayang to lead more than fifty senior students and young teachers to the construction site to carry out the construction design of various buildings. Zhang Ren and Shi Jiayang guided the students in formulating design plans, reviewing the drawings drawn by the students, giving special lectures on the problems encountered by the students in the design, and organizing the students to carry out scientific research to improve the design quality. They have completed more than twenty research projects, such as "slot-type hole concrete water barrier," the use of concrete instead of steel for the volute casing on water turbines, and the construction method of building large dams by pouring sand into water, which provides favorable conditions for accelerating the progress of the project and improving the quality of the project.

Xia Zhenhuan, Li Piji, and more than ten young teachers from the Hydraulics Teaching and Research Group have created the experience of combining production practice with teaching theory in the Hydraulics course. Last semester, after six classes of students learned the theory of energy dissipation and spillway structures in hydraulics, they successfully completed six energy dissipation design tasks on projects and developed new surface flow energy dissipation and flip bucket energy dissipation building types for a large-scale water conservancy project.

Chen Liangsheng and Chen Zudong are professors who teach soil mechanics and construction science. More than ten engineering designs undertaken by the Hydraulic Engineering Department last year and the construction of two projects, including geological exploration and construction design, were completed under the joint guidance of the two of them and young teachers.

Ten months ago, when these six professors were faced with the task of not only teaching textbook knowledge but also guiding students in production and scientific research, they were all somewhat nervous. Most of them supported the Party's education policy, but they were afraid of losing face if they could not guide production, so they asked the Party organization to wait until they gained production experience before implementing the education policy. A few people doubted the Party's education policy and were unwilling to participate in production and guide students in production. At that time, the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward in water conservancy construction across the country and in Beijing had already formed, requiring them to immediately get involved in production in order to reform teaching. The Party organization of the Hydraulic Engineering Department helped them to correctly understand the Party's education policy and called on them to put down their airs and combine with the masses, learning and improving in practice. In the design of more than ten water conservancy projects by graduating students, they were assigned to serve as design group leaders or to guide various special problems. Before the work began, they were helped to select some designs for experimentation. During the design process, when encountering difficulties in implementing the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical results in various projects, the Party organization mobilized young teachers, students, and them to carry out scientific research together, using collective strength to combine learning and originality, solving more than 30 problems in more than ten projects. The entire design task was completed in four months, and the students' thinking and independent working ability were also significantly improved.

The vivid facts dispelled their doubts about the Party's education policy and also gave them a new understanding of the Party organization's leadership role and the wisdom of the masses. When a professor from another school came to visit the Hydraulic Engineering Department of Tsinghua University, Zhang Ren said to him: To make greater achievements, we must rely on the leadership of the Party. Relying solely on our old experts with old frameworks will not produce much. He also said: When calculating strength, we must include the students. They are numerous and are the new people cultivated by socialist education. These professors also seized the opportunity to participate in specific work in production in order to improve themselves faster and improve teaching work.

Professor Chen Liangsheng originally studied soil mechanics and rarely studied geological surveying work and rock geological conditions, which are very important for water conservancy construction. Therefore, he went to the middle reaches of the Yellow River to learn about this knowledge in conjunction with production tasks. He listened to lectures from young teachers with geological surveying experience with the students, climbed steep cliffs and precipices to view rocks, and walked two hundred miles along the river in a week to collect soil material information. Now he has begun to use the knowledge he has learned and the information he has collected to compile new soil mechanics lecture notes. Zhang Ren also often drew drawings by hand at the Miyun Reservoir construction site. When encountering problems, he consulted with the Party organization to organize teachers and students to discuss them together. He was not familiar with some specific calculation work, so he asked students to teach him. This not only successfully completed the design task but also improved himself and everyone together.

The professors' original fear of engaging in production has now been replaced by a positive, active, and happy mood. Zhang Ren was one of the professors who had many concerns about accepting the Miyun Reservoir design work nine months ago, but recently, when the school urged him to come back for the New Year and Spring Festival, he was reluctant to leave the construction site. He was particularly happy to be guiding students in production on a large reservoir project with a storage capacity of 4.1 billion cubic meters. He said: Sincerely accepting the leadership of the Party, humbly combining with the masses, playing one's role in work, and strengthening learning are shortcuts to accelerating the transformation and improvement of oneself.

    劳动实践丰富了教学理论
    清华水利系教授指导学生完成多项工程设计
    据新华社13日讯　清华大学水利系的六位老教授，在党组织的帮助下，经过自己的努力，过去一年中在理论联系实际的道路上前进了一步。
    这六位教授是水利系主任张任，副主任夏震寰和各个教研组主任施嘉炀、李丕济、陈梁生、陈祖东。他们都是具有多年教学工作经验的老教师，但原来都是程度不同地缺少生产经验。经过去年十个多月的努力，他们在领导学生进行生产劳动中，已经总结了不少的生产经验，并用来丰富和提高理论教学。
    张任、施嘉炀正在密云水库工地担任着设计代表组组长的工作（相当于设计总工程师的工作）。这个水库的设计是由清华大学水利系担任的。去年9月这项工程开始施工后，水利系党组织就派张任、施嘉炀带领了五十多个高年级的学生和青年教师组成设计代表组到工地进行各项建筑的施工设计。张任、施嘉炀指导学生们拟定设计方案；审定学生们画的图纸，针对学生们在设计中遇到的难题进行专题讲授，并且组织学生们开展科学研究，提高设计质量。他们已经完成了二十多项研究课题：如“槽型孔混凝土阻水帷幕”、采用混凝土代替钢材做水轮机上的蜗管、倒砂入水筑大坝的施工方法等，给加速工程的进度和提高工程质量提供了有利的条件。
    夏震寰、李丕济和水力学教研组的十多位青年教师在水力学这门课上，创造了结合生产实际讲授理论的经验。上学期六个班的学生学习了水力学中有关消能和泄水建筑的理论后，出色地完成了六项工程上的消能设计任务，又为一项大型水利工程研究出了新的面流消能、挑流消能的建筑型式。
    陈梁生、陈祖东是讲授土力学和施工学的教授，水利系去年所担任的十多项工程的设计和两项工程的施工，其中有关地质踏勘和施工设计，都是在他们两人和青年教师的共同指导下完成的。
    十个月前，这六位教授刚刚面对着既要教授书本知识又要指导学生进行生产和科学研究的任务时，内心都有些紧张。他们当中多数人拥护党的教育方针，但是怕指导不了生产丢面子，因而要求党组织等他们获得了生产经验后再按教育方针办事。有个别怀疑党的教育方针，不愿意参加生产和指导学生生产。当时全国和北京市水利建设大跃进的高潮已经形成。要求他们立即跨上生产之马以便改革教学。水利系党组织一方面帮助他们正确地认识党的教育方针，同时号召他们放下架子和群众结合，在实践中边学边提高。在毕业班学生进行十多项水利工程设计当中，就分配他们担任设计组组长或各个专门问题的指导工作。在工作开始前，帮助他们选择了一部分设计进行了试验。在设计过程中，当各项工程贯彻多快好省的方针遇到难题时，党组织又发动青年教师、学生和他们一起开展科学研究，运用集体力量把学习和独创结合起来，解决了十多项工程中的三十多个难题，四个月的时间就完成了全部设计任务，学生的思想和独立工作能力也都有了显著提高。
    生动的事实打破了他们对党的教育方针的怀疑，同时也使他们对党组织的领导作用和群众的智慧产生了新的看法。当别的学校有一位教授来清华大学水利系访问时，张任对他说：要想做出更大的成绩，就要依靠党的领导，光靠我们这些老专家旧框框多，是干不出多少名堂来的。他又说：计算力量时，一定要把学生计算在内，他们人多势众是社会主义教育培养出来的新人。这些教授在生产中也抓紧机会参加具体工作，以便更快的提高自己，改进教学工作。
    陈梁生教授原来是研究土力学的，对水利建设上很需要的地质勘测工作、有关岩石地质条件等问题，过去很少研究。于是，他就到黄河中游结合生产任务学习这方面的知识。他和学生一起听有地质勘测工作经验的青年教师讲课，攀登陡崖悬壁查看岩石，在一个星期里曾沿河步行二百里搜集土料的资料。现在他已开始运用所学来的知识和搜集到的资料在编写新的土力学讲义。张任在密云水库工地也经常亲手画图，遇到问题就和党组织商量组织师生全体讨论。有些具体计算工作，他不熟悉，就请学生教给他。这样既胜利地完成了设计任务，也使自己和大家共同得到了提高。
    这些教授们原先害怕搞生产的思想情绪，现在已经被积极主动、愉快舒畅的情绪所代替了。张任在九个月之前是对接受密云水库设计工作存在不少顾虑的教授之一，可是最近当学校催他回来过新年和春节时，他却舍不得离开工地了。他为自己在储水量达四十一亿公方的大型水库工程上指导学生进行生产而感到特别高兴。他说：真诚地接受党组织的领导，虚心地和群众结合，在工作中发挥自己的作用，加强学习，是加速改造和提高自己的捷径。
