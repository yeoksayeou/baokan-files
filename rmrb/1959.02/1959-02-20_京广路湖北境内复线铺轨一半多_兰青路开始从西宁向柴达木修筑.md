Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 17th: The roadbed for the double-track section of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway north of Wuhan in Hubei Province has been basically completed, and more than half of the rails have been laid.

The construction of the double-track railway officially commenced in November of last year. Under the slogan "People's Railway, Built by the People," the more than 100,000 people along the railway line who participated in the construction were full of enthusiasm and launched a socialist great competition of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, resulting in not only fast construction speed but also good quality.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, February 17th: The construction of the railway from Xining to the Qaidam Basin has begun. Tens of thousands of railway construction workers distributed between Xining and Quanji are working hard despite the wind and sand. All seventeen tunnels along the line have commenced construction; the earthwork and stonework for the 406-kilometer roadbed section from Xining to Xiligou are being carried out in stages.

Quanji is located 53 kilometers southeast of Da Qaidam. This section of the line from Xining to Quanji is a part of the Lan-Qing Railway, with a total length of 698 kilometers. In the future, it will extend westward to Youshashan, the westernmost oil-producing area in the Qaidam Basin. This railway is of great significance for developing the oil in the Qaidam Basin, as well as mineral resources such as salt, coal, and non-ferrous metals in central Qinghai, and promoting the economic and cultural development of minority areas.

    京广路湖北境内复线铺轨一半多
    兰青路开始从西宁向柴达木修筑
    新华社武汉17日电　京广铁路湖北境内武汉以北一段复线，已基本上筑好了路基，有一半以上铺好了铁轨。
    这段铁路的复线是在去年11月份正式开工建设的，参加修路的沿线十多万群众在“人民铁路人民修”的口号下，干劲冲天，掀起了比先进、学先进、赶先进的社会主义大竞赛，不仅施工速度快，而且质量好。
    据新华社西宁17日电　从西宁通往柴达木盆地的铁路开工修筑了。分布在西宁到全吉间的几万名筑路员工，正冒着风沙在顽强地劳动。全线十七座隧道已全部动工；从西宁到希里沟一段长四百零六公里的路基土石方工程正在分段施工。
    全吉在大柴旦东南五十三公里。西宁到全吉的这段线路，是兰青铁路的一段，全长六百九十八公里，它将来还要向西延伸，直到柴达木盆地最西部的石油产地油砂山。这条铁路对开发柴达木盆地的石油，和青海中部的盐、煤、有色金属等矿产资源，促进少数民族地区经济文化的发展，有着重大的意义。
