Risking Lives to Extinguish a Major Fire
Generously Donating to Disaster Victims

“Dear People's Police Comrades:
Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, you have displayed a high degree of class friendship, bravely extinguishing the fire and donating to disaster victims with a communist spirit, deeply moving us. … On behalf of all the farmers in the township, we express our heartfelt gratitude to you.
        Zhaotong Xiaozha Township Party Branch"

This letter of gratitude is posted on Banbanfang Street in Zhaotong County, Yunnan Province. After reading it, passersby praised the communist spirit of the police comrades. The story is as follows:

At nine o'clock in the morning on October 27th of last year, the farmers were working hard in the fields. A house about three hundred meters away from the farm suddenly burst into black smoke from the roof. The fire borrowed the power of the wind, and the wind fueled the fire, which grew bigger and bigger. Upon discovering this, police officers Guo Rutian and others immediately rushed to the scene to rescue the situation. However, because the fire was so fierce, it was difficult to extinguish. At this time, comrades like Guo Rutian thought, can we just watch the people's property be lost? No, absolutely not. So, risking their lives, they rescued the situation in the raging fire, disregarding the damage to their clothes and burns to their bodies. Finally, with the help of the masses, the fire was extinguished, and some grain and furniture were rescued.

The fire was extinguished, but they then thought of the disaster victim, Yang Huanzhi, whose husband had passed away last year, leaving behind four children. Life was already difficult, and this would be even more painful. After discussion, deputy squadron leader Qian Dafu and squad leader Zhou Jiarong decided to mobilize everyone to donate for disaster relief. In fact, the comrades already had this intention in their hearts. Qian Dafu took the lead in donating his quilt. In a short period of time, a total of two quilts, four bed sheets, and 59 yuan in Renminbi were donated, and representatives were sent to the township to provide relief to the disaster victim.

    灭大火奋不顾身
    助灾民慷慨捐款“亲爱的民警同志们：
    你们在党和毛主席的领导下，发扬了高度的阶级友爱，英勇灭火和捐助灾民的共产主义风格，使我们深受感动。……我们代表全乡农民，向你们表示衷心的感谢。
        昭通小闸乡党支部”
    这封感谢信，贴在云南省昭通县板板房街上，来往行人看后，都深赞民警同志这种共产主义风格。事情是这样：
    去年10月27日上午九时，农民都在田野上紧张地劳动，距农场约三百公尺处的一座房子，突然从房顶上冒出团团黑烟，火借风势，风助火威，越着越大。执勤民警郭汝田等同志发现后，立即奔赴现场抢救，但因火势甚旺，不好扑灭。这时郭汝田等同志想，能看着人民财产受损失不管吗？不，绝对不能。于是，他们冒着生命危险，在熊熊的烈火中抢救，不顾自己衣服烧坏和烧伤肉体。终于，在群众的协助下，将火扑灭，并救出部分粮食和家具。
    火是扑灭了，但他们又想到受灾者杨焕之，丈夫去年亡故了，留下四个小孩，本来生活就很困难，这时会更加痛苦。分队副谦大富和小队长周家荣同志经过研究后，决定动员大家捐献救灾。其实，同志们心里早有此意。谦大富带头捐出自己的被子，在片刻时间内，共捐献了被子两床，被单四条，人民币五十九元，派代表送到乡里救济受灾者。
