Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 5th: TASS reported that Comrade Belousov, alternate member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, delivered a speech at the 21st Congress of the CPSU on the morning of February 3.

He said that the great significance of the 21st Party Congress to our country and the entire international life is inestimable both now and in the future. The remarkable achievements that the Soviet Union has made in recent years in developing its economy, science, culture, and improving the material well-being of the Soviet people are the result of the unwavering implementation of the Party's Leninist general line.

Comrade Belousov then stated that in order to implement the resolutions of the 20th Party Congress, the Party has implemented the following major measures in a short period of time, such as reforming the management of the national economy, developing agriculture and strengthening the collective farm system, expanding the powers of republics and local organs, and many other measures. All this has further significantly developed the socialist economy and enhanced the creative initiative of the Soviet people in communist construction and state management.

Comrade Belousov said that while our entire party and all our people were actively striving to implement these major resolutions, the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov embarked on the path of factional activities, attempting to obstruct the implementation of the major resolutions of the 20th Party Congress and subsequent plenary sessions of the Party Central Committee. While listing these well-known facts to the delegates to the Congress, he said, I cannot but acknowledge with deep sorrow that I was unable to recognize the anti-Party conspiracy of this factional group in a timely manner at this important moment for the Party.

The speaker said that he had condemned and still condemns the anti-Party factional and divisive activities of this group, and that he had voted in favor of the resolutions made against the anti-Party group at the June Plenary Session of the Central Committee. He added that he fully agreed with Comrade Khrushchev's assessment of the anti-Party activities of this group in his reports at this Congress, at the December Plenary Session of the Central Committee, and at other Central Committee plenary sessions.

Comrade Belousov said, how did my mistake arise? According to him, when the Central Committee discussed the issue of reforming the management of industry and construction, he had expressed doubts and opposition to individual proposals for the planned reorganization. The speaker said that his incorrect position in this extremely important matter led him to make a huge political error and support the anti-Party group. He said that he had never opposed the line pursued by the Presidium of the Central Committee before, and that he had fully agreed with its proposals on the issues of reclaiming wasteland and foreign policy.

Comrade Belousov said that he thanked the Central Committee for giving him the opportunity to atone for his guilt to the Party in state work. He continued, as for my attitude towards the reform of industrial and construction management, I, like the whole party and all the people, believe that all these measures are absolutely correct.

Comrade Belousov said that, while working as the Soviet ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, I became even more convinced of how the anti-Party group hindered the implementation of a series of measures aimed at easing international tensions, and how much damage it caused to Soviet foreign policy.

Comrade Belousov then spoke about the Soviet proposals on the Berlin issue and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. He said that these profound, humanitarian, and peace-loving proposals were supported by all residents of the German Democratic Republic.

He said that Khrushchev's report on the Soviet Union's seven-year plan for developing the national economy painted a vivid picture of the great program of communist construction. Relying on the resolutions of the 21st Congress, the Soviet people will advance more rapidly along the Leninist road towards a bright future.

Comrade Belousov concluded by saying that he assured the 21st Party Congress that he would always defend the interests of the Party, actively fight to implement the Party's general line, and fight for the victory of Marxism-Leninism, for the victory of communism.

    在苏共二十一次代表大会上
    别尔乌辛的发言
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会主席团候补委员别尔乌辛同志3日上午在苏共第二十一次代表大会上发了言。
    他说，第二十一次党代表大会现在和将来对我国和整个国际生活的巨大意义是无法估计的。最近几年，苏联在发展经济、科学、文化，提高苏联人民物质福利方面取得的显著成就是始终不渝地贯彻党的列宁主义总路线的结果。
    别尔乌辛同志接着说，党为了实现第二十次代表大会的决议，在短短的期间内实行了下列一些重大措施，如改组国民经济的管理、发展农业和加强集体农庄制度、扩大共和国和地方机构的权力以及其他许多措施。这一切进一步显著地发展了社会主义经济，提高了苏联人民在共产主义建设和国家管理当中的创造性积极性。
    别尔乌辛同志说，在我们全党和全体人民为实现这些重大决议而积极奋斗的时候，马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团走上了派别活动的道路，企图阻挠第二十次代表大会和以后历次党中央全会的重大决议的实现。在向代表大会代表列举这些人所共知的事实的时候，他说，我不能不怀着沉痛的心情确认，我在这个对党说来是重要的时刻没有能及时识破这个派别集团的反党阴谋。
    发言人说，他过去和现在都谴责这个集团反党的派别活动和分裂活动，在中央六月全会上他曾投票赞成对反党集团作出的决议。他补充说，他完全同意赫鲁晓夫同志在这次代表大会上和在中央十二月全会以及其他中央全会上所作的报告中对这个集团的反党活动的论断。
    别尔乌辛同志说，我的错误是怎样产生的呢？据他说，在中央委员会讨论改组工业和建筑业的管理问题时，他对拟定中的改组的个别建议曾表示过怀疑和反对。发言人说，我在这个极重要的事情中的不正确立场，导致我犯了巨大的政治错误，支持了反党集团。他说，他以前从来没有反对过中央委员会主席团所执行的路线，其中他曾完全同意关于开垦荒地和外交政策问题的建议。
    别尔乌辛同志说，他感谢中央委员会给予他机会在国家工作中来向党赎罪。他继续说，至于谈到我对改组工业和建筑业管理的态度，我同全党和全体人民一样认为，这一切措施都是绝对正确的。
    别尔乌辛同志说，作为苏联大使在德意志民主共和国工作的时候，我更加确信了，反党集团阻碍实现一系列旨在缓和国际紧张局势的措施，使苏联外交政策遭到了怎样的损害。
    别尔乌辛同志然后谈到苏联关于柏林问题和缔结对德和约的建议，他谈到，这些深刻的人道主义的、爱好和平的建议受到德意志民主共和国全体居民的拥护。
    他说，赫鲁晓夫关于苏联发展国民经济七年计划的报告描绘出共产主义建设伟大纲领的鲜明图景。苏联人民依靠二十一次代表大会的决议，将更加迅速地沿着列宁主义的道路向光辉的未来前进。
    别尔乌辛同志最后说，我向二十一次党代表大会保证，我将永远捍卫党的利益，将积极为执行党的总路线而斗争，为马克思列宁主义的胜利，为共产主义的胜利而斗争。
