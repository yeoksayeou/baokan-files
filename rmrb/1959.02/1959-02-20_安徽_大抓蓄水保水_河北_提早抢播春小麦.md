Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 19th: Anhui Province has started its spring plowing preparations early due to the large increase in spring planting area. Currently, on the Huaibei Plain, professional teams organized by the People's Communes are simultaneously tilling the fields, building embankments, and delivering fertilizer. In the Fuyang Special District, all 36 million mu of farmland have been plowed once or twice, and 650,000 mu of spring rice fields have been prepared, with each mu receiving more than 400 dan of fertilizer. The large tools needed for converting to rice planting have also been repaired, and more than 130,000 people in the district have been trained in rice and cotton planting techniques. In the Wuhu Special District, the main rice-producing area, 640,000 mu out of 660,000 mu of seedbeds have been plowed and harrowed once or twice. More than 27,000 iron and woodworking workers in the district are rushing to repair and manufacture various farm tools, with more than 120,000 large farm implements already repaired. In the Huainan area, a spring plowing production upsurge has formed in every county. In the Lu'an Special District, the main hemp-producing area, more than 30,000 mu of hemp have been planted. In the drought-prone Feidong, Feixi, Dingyuan, and Shouxian counties in the Huainan area, and the flood-prone Suxian, Suixi, and Fengtai counties in the Huaibei Plain, efforts are currently being strengthened on key water conservancy lines, and spring repair projects are being accelerated. Recently, various localities have also taken advantage of the rain to carry out large-scale water storage and conservation work. The repair and manufacturing of farm tools has also been intensified throughout the province. The province plans to promote more than 200,000 rice transplanters, and this year it is required that 60% of the rice fields be transplanted using rice transplanters.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 19th: Hebei Province has begun sowing spring wheat. Tianjin City and the Tangshan Special District have seized the opportunity to rush-plant more than 400,000 mu. The province plans to sow more than 4 million mu of spring wheat this year.

Hebei has summed up the experience of increased production through early sowing last year, and mobilized the masses to seize the opportunity of the arrival of "Rain Water" (one of the 24 solar terms) to rush-sow spring wheat. The masses in Cangxian County, recognizing that early sowing is an important measure to achieve increased production, quickly formed more than 100 shock teams and plunged into the spring wheat rush-sowing campaign. After holding commune member meetings, the communes and teams in Yanshan County quickly organized more than 140,000 laborers and have rush-sown more than 30,000 mu of spring wheat. In the process of sowing, all localities have paid special attention to ensuring quality. This year, the spring wheat land that is being rush-planted is generally plowed to a depth of about 1.5 chi (approximately 1.5 feet), with about 10,000 jin (approximately 5 metric tons) of base fertilizer applied per mu, a sowing width of 4 to 7 cun (approximately 5.3 to 9.3 inches), and more than 30 to 40 jin (approximately 15 to 20 kg) of seeds sown per mu. Thanks to the strengthened specific leadership of the local Party committees, the sowing speed is greatly accelerating.

    安徽——大抓蓄水保水
    河北——提早抢播春小麦
    据新华社合肥19日电　安徽省备耕工作随着春播面积大增已提早动手。目前，在淮北平原上，各人民公社组织的专业队伍，正在边整田、边打埂、边送肥。阜阳专区三千六百万亩耕地已全部耕过一遍到两遍，有六十五万亩春稻田已整理好，每亩施足四百多担肥料；改种水稻所需的大型工具也已修好，全区还训练了种水稻、种棉花的技术手十三万多人。水稻主要产区的芜湖专区，六十六万亩秧田已有六十四万亩耕耙过一至二遍；全区两万七千多铁木工人，正在赶修赶制各种农具，仅大型农具就已修好十二万多件。在淮南地区，县县都已形成春耕生产的热潮。大麻主要产区的六安专区，已种上大麻三万多亩。在淮南地区易旱的肥东、肥西、定远、寿县等县和淮北平原易涝的宿县、濉溪、凤台等县，目前正在增强水利干线的力量，抓紧春修工程。最近各地还趁雨后开展了大规模的蓄水、保水工作。农具的修理制造工作也已在全省范围内加紧进行，全省计划推广插秧机二十多万部，今年要求60％的稻田用插秧机插秧。
    新华社天津19日电　河北省开始播种春麦。天津市和唐山专区已抓紧时机抢播四十多万亩，全省今年共计划播种春麦四百多万亩。
    河北各地总结了去年早播增产的经验，发动群众抓紧“雨水”已到的时机抢播春麦。沧县群众由于认识到早播是实现增产的重要措施，很快就组成一百多个突击队，投入了抢播春麦的运动。盐山县各社、队在召开社员大会以后，迅速组织起十四万多劳动力，已抢播春麦三万多亩。各地在播种当中，特别注意到保证质量。今年一般抢种的春麦地，深翻都在一尺五寸左右，亩施底肥一万斤左右，播幅四至七寸，每亩下种三十到四十斤以上。由于各地党委加强了具体领导，播种速度正在大大加快。
