Xinhua News Agency, February 21st: The spring afforestation campaign has been preliminarily launched in most parts of southern China and the North China Plain. According to statistics from twelve southern provinces and autonomous regions, including Jiangsu, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Guizhou, as of February 14th, a total of 53.93 million mu of trees have been planted in the past month and a half, and 189.18 million trees have been planted around houses and villages. At present, Northeast and Northwest China, as well as provinces and autonomous regions that have already started afforestation, are actively preparing, and a large-scale spring afforestation campaign is expected to begin in March.

The characteristics of this year's spring afforestation campaign are early commencement and rapid progress. Most provinces and autonomous regions across the country held meetings one or two months ago to arrange afforestation work, and many provinces and autonomous regions have established greening command organizations, headed by the Party committee secretary. Therefore, the afforestation campaign has developed rapidly, and those that were slower last year have caught up this year. In early February, Guangxi's afforestation area reached more than 6.26 million mu, more than one and a half times that of the same period last year, once taking the lead in the country. Ten days later, Sichuan's afforestation area surged from 1.6 million mu to 11.97 million mu, exceeding ten times that of the same period last year, replacing Guangxi in taking the lead in the country. The province has also decided to launch an afforestation campaign month: half a month for preparation, ten days for afforestation, and five days for finishing work. In addition, the progress of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Henan and other provinces this year is also faster than last year. Jiangxi has afforested 5.69 million mu, more than five times that of the same period last year, and nineteen counties have completed or exceeded the afforestation tasks assigned by the province.

This spring, various regions will vigorously plant timber forests to meet the growing need for timber. This year, the construction area of timber forests nationwide will account for more than half of the total afforestation area. Hunan, Fujian, Henan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and other provinces and autonomous regions have jointly built 17,733,500 mu of fast-growing and high-yielding forests. Southern regions will also develop oil-tea forests and reclaim old tea plantations, while northern regions will plant a large number of walnut trees and actively develop woody oil production. Bamboo-producing areas will also develop bamboo forests this spring to increase the supply of bamboo.

In order to improve the quality of afforestation, various regions have emphasized the dissemination of technology, the implementation of technical measures, and the training of key personnel this spring. In January, Liaoning Province held an afforestation technology conference attended by 750 people, and it is expected that 5,000 technical backbones can be trained throughout the province by early March. Hunan Province has universally promoted measures such as changing from one-hoe method to land preparation afforestation, changing sparse planting to dense planting, changing single rows to multiple rows, changing double plants to single plants, and changing decentralized small-scale afforestation to large-scale contiguous afforestation. Now, the province has basically eliminated the extensive one-hoe method of afforestation. (Attached picture)

    乘春光为大地赶绣新装
    南方各省已植树五千多万亩，全国造林运动即将展开
    据新华社21日讯　春季造林运动已在南方大部地区和华北平原初步展开。据江苏、广西、四川、贵州等南方十二个省、区到14日为止的统计，一个半月来共已造林五千三百九十三万亩，四旁植树一万八千九百一十八万株。目前，东北、西北各地以及已经开始造林的省、区都在积极准备，大规模的春季造林运动预计将在3月开始。
    今春造林运动的特点是，抓得早，进度快。全国大部省、区早在一两个月前就召开会议布置了造林工作，不少省、区都成立了绿化指挥机构，由党委书记挂帅，因此造林运动开展迅速，去年进度较慢的今年都急起直追，赶了上来。广西在2月初造林面积达六百二十六万多亩，超过去年同期一倍半，一度在全国领先。十天以后，四川造林面积由一百六十万亩激增到一千一百九十七万亩，超过去年同期十倍，代替广西在全国领先。这个省还决定开展一个造林运动月：半月准备，十天造林，五天扫尾。此外，江西、浙江、河南等省今年进度也比去年快。江西已造林五百六十九万亩，为去年同期的五倍多，并且有十九个县已经完成或超额完成了省里分配的造林任务。
    今春各地将大力营造用材林来满足日益增长的对木材的需要。今年全国用材林营造面积将占造林总面积的一半强。湖南、福建、河南、广西、贵州等省、区共已营造速生丰产林一十七万七千三百三十五万亩。南方各地还将发展油茶林和垦复旧有茶山，北方各地将大量种植核桃树，积极发展木本油料生产。产竹地区今春还要发展竹林，增加竹材供应量。
    为了提高造林质量，各地今春更强调了传播技术，贯彻技术措施，训练骨干等工作。辽宁省1月份曾召开有七百五十人参加的造林技术会议，预计3月初全省可以训练出技术骨干五千人。湖南省普遍推行了改一锄法为整地造林，改稀植为密植，改单行为多行，改双株为单株，改分散小块造林为大面积成片造林等措施，现在全省已基本上消灭了粗放的一锄法造林。（附图片）
