Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 9th: Before the Spring Festival, many people's communes in Jiangsu Province conducted a general inspection of the care and maintenance of draft animals. Through the inspection, further measures were taken to ensure that every draft animal is strong and well-fed, ready for the upcoming spring plowing and great production movement.

This cattle inspection was carried out on the basis of the work done in various places to strengthen the winter care of draft animals. According to the inspection, thanks to the various measures taken last winter, the recovery and increase in fatness of draft cattle has been rapidly promoted.

As early as November last year, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China studied and deployed the work of winter maintenance of draft animals at the meeting of the first secretaries of the prefectural committees. Therefore, party committees at all levels attached great importance to this work. Many commune party secretaries and cadres went deep into the cattle sheds, inspecting and helping the breeders solve specific problems. After the first secretary of the Shanyang Commune Party Committee in Baoying County went deep into the major brigades for inspection, he found that there was no grass laid on the ground of the cattle houses; the drinking water was too cold; the tree roots burned in the heated beds for the cattle produced too much smoke, the cattle could not open their eyes, and the air was not circulating well. He studied solutions with the breeders overnight and changed the situation.

In terms of keeping cattle warm, in addition to building cattle houses that are impervious to wind and rain in various places, grass coats were generally provided for the cattle. In strengthening the maintenance of draft animals, new draft animal management systems are being formed in many areas. The Lianshui County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China organized forces to carefully inspect the maintenance of more than 28,000 draft animals, and generally established a draft animal management archive system, which greatly strengthened the responsibility of the breeders, and brought a new look to the maintenance of draft animals.

Due to the strengthened leadership of party committees at all levels in the maintenance of draft animals, the recovery of fatness of draft animals in various parts of Jiangsu has been rapid. For example, in Tangquan People's Commune in Jiangpu County, all 647 draft animals in the commune reached more than 80% fatness, becoming a commune with full-fat cattle.

    让头头耕牛膘足力壮  江苏进行养牛大检查
    据新华社南京9日电　江苏各地不少人民公社在春节前，对耕牛养护情况普遍进行了一次检查。通过检查，再次采取措施，让头头耕牛膘足力壮，迎接即将到来的春耕大生产运动。
    这次耕牛检查，是在各地加强耕牛过冬养护工作的基础上进行的。据检查，由于去冬采取了各种措施，迅速促进了耕牛复膘、增膘。
    早在去年11月份，中共江苏省委就在地委第一书记会议上，研究和部署了冬季耕牛保养工作。因此，各级党委对这项工作十分重视。许多公社的党委书记和干部，深入牛舍，一面检查，一面帮助饲养员解决具体问题。宝应县山阳公社党委第一书记深入各大队检查后，发现牛屋地下没有铺草；饮水太冷；给耕牛取暖的火炕烧的树根烟太大，牛睁不开眼，空气不太流通等情况，连夜和饲养员研究出解决办法，改变了这种情况。
    在耕牛保暖工作上，各地除了修建了不透风、雨的牛屋外，并普遍给耕牛穿了草大衣。在加强耕牛养护工作中，新的耕牛管理制度正在很多地区形成。中共涟水县委组织力量，认真检查了二万八千多头耕牛的保养情况，普遍建立耕牛管理档案制，大大加强了饲养员的责任，使耕牛保养出现了新的面貌。
    由于各级党委对耕牛养护工作加强了领导，江苏各地的耕牛复膘很快。如江浦县汤泉人民公社，全社六百四十七头耕牛，头头达到八成膘以上，成为耕牛满膘社。
