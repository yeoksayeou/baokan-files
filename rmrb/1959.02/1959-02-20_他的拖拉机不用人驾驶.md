    His Tractor Drives Itself

    In the "Ertis" State Farm of the Kazakh Republic of the Soviet Union, there is a tractor driver named Ivan Loginov who invented an automatic control simulation device for the "C-80" tractor. The tractor can work with this mechanism without a driver. The tractor is connected to a plow that does not need to be attached by an operator and can cultivate the land itself according to the specified depth.

    As early as the autumn of 1956, Loginov began his experiments. In the spring of 1957, the tractor equipped with Loginov's invented simulation device automatically cultivated 400 hectares of land in the "Ertis" State Farm, without missing a single piece of land. In 1958, the tractor equipped with the simulation device was tested at the Kazakh Republic Machine Testing Station and received good evaluations.

    Loginov's initiative can not only greatly reduce the labor of tractor drivers, but also improve the quality of machine cultivation. At the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU in December 1958, Comrade Khrushchev gave a high evaluation to this invention. (Attached picture)

    他的拖拉机不用人驾驶
    在苏联哈萨克共和国“额尔齐斯”国营农场，有一个名叫伊万·洛吉诺夫的拖拉机手，他发明了一种自动操纵“C—80”型拖拉机的模拟装置，拖拉机可以依靠这种机械工作不需要人驾驶，拖拉机联挂犁也不需要联挂机手而能严格按照规定的深度自行耕作。
    早在1956年的秋天，洛吉诺夫就开始了试验。1957年春天，安装了洛吉诺夫发明的模拟装置的拖拉机，在“额尔齐斯”国营农场自动耕种了四百公顷土地，并且没有一块漏耕的土地。1958年装有模拟装置的拖拉机在哈萨克共和国机器试验站进行了试验，获得了良好的评价。
    洛吉诺夫的创举不但可以大大减轻拖拉机手的劳动，而且还能提高机器耕作的质量。在苏共中央1958年12月全会上，赫鲁晓夫同志对这个发明给予了很高的评价。（附图片）
