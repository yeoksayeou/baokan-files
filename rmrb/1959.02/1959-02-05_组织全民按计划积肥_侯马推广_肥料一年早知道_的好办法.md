Houma, February 4th (Reported by this newspaper) - Yonggu Management Area of Xinghuo People's Commune in Houma City, Shanxi Province, has created a new method for organizing all the people to accumulate and produce fertilizer called "Knowing About Fertilizer a Year in Advance." After the promotion of this new method, it has greatly promoted the work of accumulating and producing fertilizer. Commune members praised this method, saying: "With a year's advance knowledge, everyone is enthusiastic about accumulating fertilizer, and arrangements are made efficiently and effectively to ensure even greater harvests."

"Knowing About Fertilizer a Year in Advance" is a comprehensive measure ranging from organizational leadership to mass action, from planning to fertilizer accumulation methods. It mainly involves the use of charts, so that the commune, management area, production team, and specialized fertilizer accumulation teams can plan fertilizer accumulation and production targets and fertilizer varieties level by level according to the total annual fertilizer requirements of various crops. Then, according to the needs of each agricultural season, the quantity of fertilizer to be accumulated and produced in each period and the ratio of natural fertilizer, soil fertilizer, and bacterial fertilizer are specifically determined. In addition to the method of step-by-step contracting for collective units (fixing fertilizer accumulation and production tasks by season and month according to seasonal needs), grass-roots organizations at all levels also specifically fixed the monthly, seasonal, and annual fertilizer accumulation tasks for breeders, cooks, herdsmen, and each commune member's family. Cadres of the commune, management area, and production team, as well as each commune member, have this chart. By looking at this chart, they can know the total annual fertilizer accumulation and production tasks of their unit and individual, as well as the specific targets for each stage and month.

When formulating the "Knowing About Fertilizer a Year in Advance" chart, Yonggu Management Area generally took four steps: First, calculate the needs. Based on the target of 700 jin per mu for wheat, 1,000 jin per mu for cotton, and 1,500 jin per mu for autumn crops in the entire management area, it was determined to increase the application this year to more than 20,000 jin on the basis of an average of more than 6,000 jin of fertilizer applied per mu last year. The entire management area needs a total of 1.4 billion jin of fertilizer. Second, find out the quantity of existing fertilizer and the current fertilizer accumulation and production situation, so that cadres and the masses have a clear understanding. Third, plan fertilizer sources according to local conditions, and put forward annual, seasonal, and monthly fertilizer accumulation and production targets and measures. At the same time, mobilize commune members to express their opinions and debate on expanding fertilizer quantity and improving fertilizer quality. In this way, while proposing advanced targets, measures to achieve the targets were also found. Fourth, according to the annual, seasonal, and monthly fertilizer requirements, fertilizer sources, and transportation of organizations at all levels, establish a responsibility system and assign tasks level by level to each production unit and commune member's family. Within the management area, there are tasks at all levels and targets for everyone, forming a new atmosphere of accumulating and producing fertilizer everywhere and everyone cherishing fertilizer and manure.

In order to ensure the completion of the fertilizer accumulation and production tasks, the management area determined the grading and pricing of the fertilizer accumulated by commune member families to encourage commune members to accumulate more and better fertilizer; at the same time, a reward system was formulated to commend collectives and individuals who complete the fertilizer accumulation plan on time, reward those who exceed the quota, and for collectives and individuals who do not complete the plan well, the management area promptly helps to find the reasons and think of solutions.

"Knowing About Fertilizer a Year in Advance" was gradually summarized by the Nanwu Village Production Team of Yonggu Management Area in order to solve the new problems arising in the fertilizer accumulation work after the Great Leap Forward. In the large-scale fertilizer accumulation campaign last year, commune members pursued quantity and neglected quality, resulting in a large quantity of fertilizer but poor quality; at the same time, the production team only had annual fertilizer accumulation targets and lacked specific plans, thus forming a phenomenon of disconnection between fertilizer accumulation, transportation, and application; in the past, more emphasis was placed on collective and rush fertilizer accumulation, neglecting individual perennial fertilizer accumulation, causing scattered fertilizer to be dispersed and not fully utilized. After the team's cadres analyzed the above situation, they took a series of measures in terms of organizational leadership, which created the "Knowing About Fertilizer a Year in Advance" method.

The Houma Municipal Party Committee recently comprehensively summarized this experience and convened an on-site meeting of cadres and commune member representatives from people's communes in the suburban areas of the city. Everyone believed that implementing "Knowing About Fertilizer a Year in Advance" has five major benefits: First, it strengthens the planning of fertilizer accumulation and production, and mobilizes the enthusiasm of commune members to accumulate fertilizer; second, this method specifically embodies the spirit of combining centralized leadership with the mass line, and cadres and commune members can know how much fertilizer to accumulate based on the "Knowing About Fertilizer a Year in Advance" chart; third, the implementation of this method can combine collective and individual fertilizer accumulation, specialized teams and mass fertilizer accumulation, and grasp both large and small fertilizer sources at the same time; fourth, after carrying out fertilizer accumulation work in a planned manner, it saves labor and avoids conflicts with other farm work; fifth, the process of promoting this method is a process of educating commune members to cherish fertilizer, and it also increases the personal income of commune members. According to statistics from the Yonggu Management Area, in the past five months, due to the promotion of the "Knowing About Fertilizer a Year in Advance" method, each household's average income from fertilizer payments has increased by more than seven yuan.

### 组织全民按计划积肥  侯马推广“肥料一年早知道”的好办法

    组织全民按计划积肥
    侯马推广“肥料一年早知道”的好办法
    本报侯马4日电　山西省侯马市星火人民公社永固管理区，创造了一项组织全民积肥造肥的新办法
  “肥料一年早知道”，这项新办法推广以后，大大地推动了积肥造肥工作。社员们夸奖这种办法说：“有了一年早知道，大家积肥情绪高，多快好省安排巧，保证丰产更牢靠”。
    “肥料一年早知道”是一项从组织领导到群众行动，从规划到积肥方法综合性的措施。主要是通过图表的形式，使公社、管理区、生产队和积肥专业队根据各种作物全年总的需肥情况，逐级规划出积肥造肥指标和肥料品种，再按照各个农事季节的需要情况，具体确定每个时期的积肥造肥数量和积制自然肥、土化肥、细菌肥比例。除了集体单位实行逐级包干的办法（按照季节需要，分季分月固定积肥造肥任务）外，各级基层组织还具体地给饲养员、炊事员、牧工以及每个社员家庭固定了分月、分季和全年的积肥任务。公社、管理区、生产队干部和每个社员都有这张图表，一看这张图表，就能知道所在单位和个人全年积肥造肥总的任务和分期分月的具体指标。
    永固管理区在制定“肥料一年早知道”图表时，大体上采取了四个步骤：第一，先算需要账。根据全管理区小麦亩产七百斤、棉花亩产一千斤和秋田亩产一千五百斤的指标，确定在去年平均亩施六千多斤肥料的基础上，今年增施到两万多斤。全管理区共需肥料十四亿斤。第二，摸清现有肥料的数量和当前的积肥造肥情况，使干部群众心中有底。第三，因地制宜规划肥源，提出了全年分季分月的积肥造肥指标和措施。同时发动社员就扩大肥料数量、提高肥料质量进行鸣放、辩论，这样，在提出先进指标的同时，也找到了完成指标的措施。第四，根据各级组织全年分季分月需肥量、肥源、运输等情况，建立责任制，把任务逐级分配到各生产单位和社员家庭。在管理区内层层有任务、人人有指标，形成处处积肥造肥、人人爱肥惜粪的新气象。
    为了保证积肥造肥任务的完成，管理区对社员家庭积的肥，确定了分等论价，鼓励社员多积好肥；同时制订了奖励制度，对按时完成积肥计划的集体和个人给以表扬，超额的奖励，完成不好的集体与个人，管理区及时帮助找原因，想办法。
    “肥料一年早知道”，是永固管理区南五村生产队为解决大跃进以后积肥工作产生的新问题而逐步总结出来的。这个队在去年大规模的积肥运动中，社员们追求数量，忽视质量，结果积肥量多质不好；同时生产队只有全年的积肥指标，缺少具体计划安排，因此形成积肥、运肥、施肥脱节的现象；过去多强调集体和突击积肥，忽视了个人常年积肥，使零散肥料流散，得不到充分利用。队的干部研究分析了以上情况，从组织领导上采取一系列措施，这就创造了“肥料一年早知道”的方法。
    中共侯马市委最近全面总结了这项经验，并召集全市郊区人民公社干部和社员代表举行了现场会议。大家认为实行“肥料一年早知道”有五大好处：第一，加强了积肥造肥的计划性，调动了社员积肥的积极性；第二，这个办法具体地体现了集中领导和群众路线相结合的精神，干部和社员根据“肥料一年早知道”图表，能做到积肥心中有数；第三，实行这个办法，能使集体与个人积肥、专业队与群众积肥结合起来，大小肥源同时抓；第四，有计划地进行积肥工作以后，节省了劳力，避免了和其他农活的矛盾；第五，推行这项办法的过程，就是对社员进行爱惜肥料的教育过程，同时也增加了社员个人的收入。据永固管理区的统计，最近五个月来，由于推广“肥料一年早知道”办法，每户平均收入肥料价款七元多。
