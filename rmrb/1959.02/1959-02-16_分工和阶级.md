    Division of Labor and Class
    Li Honglin Editor's Note:
    In the discussion of the division of labor between mental and manual labor, some articles believe that the division of labor between mental and manual labor is the result of class antagonism. For example, in Comrade Wei's article on December 4, it was stated that "the separation of physical labor and mental labor is caused by class antagonism"; in Comrade Lin Dehong's article on December 13, it was stated that "the antagonism and separation of physical labor and mental labor was created single-handedly by the exploiting class in order to more cruelly exploit the working people, and it is a reflection of class antagonism." Obviously, this statement is not entirely in line with historical facts. Comrade Li Honglin's article believes that the division of the two types of labor is caused by the development of productive forces. However, the emergence of classes has deepened and expanded the division of these two types of labor and made them an antagonistic relationship. We believe that Comrade Li Honglin's analysis of this issue is basically correct.
    In the discussion of the division of labor between mental and manual labor, some articles mentioned that this division is a product of class society, or that it was created by the exploiting class, or even that the exploiting class forcibly separated these two types of labor.
    This view tells us that the root of the division of labor between mental and manual labor is class society. They were originally combined with each other, and they should be combined with each other in the future, but unfortunately the exploiting class artificially separated them. Since combination is reasonable, division of labor is unreasonable.
    This view is worth discussing.
    Division of labor is caused by the development of productive forces
    Division of labor is caused by the development of productive forces, and class is the consequence of division of labor. The level of productive forces in primitive society was very low, and there was no surplus of production. At this time, it was impossible for the division of labor between mental and manual labor to occur, because the society could not provide for mental laborers. Due to the low level of productive forces, society has not yet escaped from the state of ignorance and barbarism, and production experience and social life are extremely simple, so there is no need for specialized mental labor. In line with this situation, the spiritual culture of primitive society is extremely poor. Primitive religion and art only appeared in the late stage of primitive society, and writing, as an important means of mental labor, did not exist.
    As productive forces further developed and there was a surplus of social products, this enabled some people to break away from manual labor and specialize in mental labor. Due to the development of productive forces, production experience and social life gradually became more complex, which created the need for specialized mental labor. Thus, the labor of primitive society was divided into two: the vast majority of people undertook heavy manual labor, while a small number of people specialized in mental labor.
    Is the division of unified labor into two "forcibly" separated by the exploiting class? No. If social production has not reached a certain level, if society has not generated the objective need for this division of labor, no one has such great ability to "forcibly" create this division of labor.
    Class division makes the division of labor an antagonistic relationship
    Of course, class relations have an effect on this division of labor, which is to further expand and deepen the difference between the two types of labor, and to make this division of labor an antagonistic relationship. The exploited class bears all the manual labor, while only the exploiting class and its intellectuals have the conditions to engage in mental labor. In fact, with the exception of managing the country, the exploiting class generally does not engage in mental labor, but lives a parasitic life. Those engaged in mental labor are mainly intellectuals. The economic status and political attitudes of intellectuals are not consistent, so the relationship between mental laborers and manual laborers cannot be generalized. However, in terms of the general relationship between mental labor and manual labor, it is an antagonistic relationship. Why? The reason why mental labor can exist independently as a department of social division of labor is that manual labor must provide it with material conditions. However, in class society, the material exchange between the two departments of mental labor and manual labor is carried out through the path of exploitation. That is to say, the exploiting class seizes the fruits of labor from the working people and takes a part of it to support the intellectuals. Although the living conditions of some intellectuals are not much better than those of the working people, we generally cannot say that intellectuals "exploit" the working people, but in general, the way in which wealth is transferred between these two labor departments is achieved through exploitation. Class exploitation is the root cause of making the relationship between mental labor and manual labor antagonistic.
    The impact of class antagonism on the division of labor between mental and manual labor can also be seen from other aspects. For example, inventions and creations in science and technology were originally a matter of great benefit to the development of production, but in class society, they have become a means of strengthening exploitation. The achievements of literature and art enrich the spiritual life of society, but in fact, it is mainly the exploiting class that can enjoy these achievements. Of course, this point should not be understood too extremely, and the working people are not completely unable to access cultural life. But in general, in class society, the relationship between mental labor and manual labor is essentially an antagonistic relationship.
    However, antagonism is only one characteristic of this division of labor, and it cannot represent the entire division of labor between mental and manual labor. Therefore, it cannot be said that class creates this division of labor, but only that class relations make this division of labor antagonistic.
      Division of labor is a great historical progress
    For the emergence of this division of labor, it must be admitted that it is a great progress. The entry of human society from barbarism to civilization, the division of the two types of labor is an extremely important symbol. Later progress in human society's material culture and spiritual culture are inseparable from this division of labor. Of course, the price of this progress is also quite heavy. It has caused the vast majority of people to lose their freedom and fall into a state of oppression, exploitation, and lifelong servitude. However, although this division of labor has taken such a barbaric form, it is ultimately the only feasible path at that time. As Engels said, in order to escape from the beast-like living conditions, mankind had to adopt almost beast-like means: making the vast majority of people fall into a state of servitude in exchange for the freedom of a small number of people. Although this method is shockingly barbaric, it is ultimately more progressive than primitive society.
    We should not overly beautify primitive society, because that is an ahistorical attitude. Because primitive society had no private ownership and exploitation, it also did not have the bizarre forms of class society, and people's moral character was beyond the reach of private owners and exploiters. But all of this is ultimately just a product of extremely low productivity. The labor of primitive society certainly did not have the compulsory nature of class society. In a certain sense, it can be said that labor had the characteristics of freedom, but this labor is obviously incomparable with communist labor. It is extremely backward, so strictly speaking, it cannot be called "the combination of mental labor and manual labor," but only primitive labor. Of course, the labor of primitive society should not be underestimated. The reason why human beings can separate from the animal kingdom and the reason why human society appears on the earth is precisely the merit of this primitive and simple labor. The meaning of the first stone axe and the first use of fire in human history is definitely no less than any of the most important inventions in later science and technology. But history is moving forward. On the basis of the simple labor of primitive society, mental labor was finally differentiated as an independent department. The achievements of ancient astronomy, mathematics, physics, agronomy, as well as philosophy and art, could not have appeared without this division of labor. The development of ancient social production and those tall buildings that still stand today could not have been accomplished without the large-scale use of slave labor and the application of the fruits of mental labor in production. Here, not only is mental labor a new form, but manual labor is no longer the primitive and backward form of primitive society. At this time, both production tools and labor organization have greatly advanced compared to primitive society. Of course, on the other hand, the transformation from primitive free labor to forced slave labor is also the reverse side of this progress. In short, this process is neither transferred by the will of the exploited class, nor can it be controlled by the exploiting class.
        Division of labor also brought evil consequences
    This division of labor brought progress, but also brought shocking evil consequences.
    In order to move forward in understanding the world and transforming the world, it is necessary to separate mental labor and manual labor under the conditions where productive forces have developed but are not very developed. However, the source of knowledge is practice, so this division of labor contains a fatal weakness from the beginning: intellectuals are divorced from material production and also look down on manual labor; laborers do not have the right to enjoy cultural education, and their exploited status also makes them lose interest in promoting production and caring about science and technology. Since this division of labor makes everyone a one-sidedly developed person, it will inevitably become an obstacle to the development of material production and spiritual culture. Things always move forward in contradictions. When the division of labor between mental labor and manual labor appears as a progressive factor, it also becomes an obstructing force. After slave society, feudal society, and capitalist society, this division of labor has been greatly developed, and at the same time its evil consequences have also been greatly developed. But extremes meet, and the development of this division of labor itself prepares the conditions for its own elimination.
    In capitalist society, the division of labor between mental labor and manual labor has reached its peak. The development of science, culture, and technology, as well as the application of valuable achievements in production, have reached very high achievements, but at the same time, producers have also completely become an appendage of machines. This is one aspect of the matter. On the other hand, the more developed large-scale industrial production, the more it requires producers to have higher and higher levels of science and technology. So things have become like this: the division of labor between mental labor and manual labor promotes the development of production, and the development of production further requires the elimination of this division of labor.
    Merely "requiring" is not enough, there must also be a material condition that makes the elimination of this division of labor possible. This condition has been basically prepared in capitalist society with highly developed productive forces: at this time, the level of productive forces has made it possible for every laborer to have the opportunity to enjoy full cultural education. But no matter how developed the productive forces are, the division of labor between mental labor and manual labor still cannot be eliminated, so the only way out is to carry out a socialist revolution.
          Conditions for eliminating division of labor
    The socialist revolution eliminated the exploiting class, thus eliminating the social obstacles to the combination of mental labor and manual labor. But class oppression is not the root cause of this division of labor, so the socialist revolution can only eliminate the antagonism between mental labor and manual labor (which is related to class), while their division of labor or differences must be preserved. How long this division of labor will be preserved ultimately depends on the degree of development of productive forces. In countries where the level of productive forces was already very high before the socialist revolution, the period for eliminating this division of labor will be shorter. But even so, it will still take a considerable period to universally improve the cultural level of the working people and make all the people who were separated from productive labor in the past become laborers. And these things are precisely the tasks of the socialist stage. When social production has greatly developed, social products have been greatly enriched, universal education has been popularized and improved, and the ideological awareness and moral character of the people have been greatly improved, at this time, everyone participates in productive labor, everyone has a high level of culture, and the division of labor between mental labor and manual labor will be eliminated. This is exactly when we enter communist society.

### 分工和阶级

    分工和阶级
    李洪林编者按：
    在关于脑力劳动和体力劳动分工问题的讨论中，有些文章认为脑力劳动和体力劳动的分工是阶级对立的结果。如12月4日人韦同志的文章中说：“体力劳动和脑力劳动的分离是由阶级的对立而产生的”；12月13日林德宏同志的文章中说：“体力劳动和脑力劳动的对立和分离是剥削阶级为了更残酷的剥削劳动人民所一手造成的，它是阶级对抗的反映”。显然，这种提法是不完全合乎历史事实的。李洪林同志这篇文章则认为两种劳动的分工是生产力的发展引起的，不过，阶级的产生加深了和扩大了这两种劳动的分工，并使之成为对抗的关系。我们认为，李洪林同志对这个问题的分析基本上是正确的。
    讨论脑力劳动和体力劳动的分工问题中，有些文章提到：这种分工是阶级社会的产物，或者说是剥削阶级造成的，甚至说是剥削阶级硬生生地把这两种劳动分开的。
    这种看法告诉我们：脑力劳动和体力劳动的分工的根源是阶级社会。它们本来是互相结合的，以后也应当互相结合，但是不幸剥削阶级人为地把它们拆开了。既然结合是合理的，因此分工就是不合理的。
    这种看法值得商榷。
    分工是生产力的发展引起的
    分工是生产力的发展引起的，阶级则是分工的后果。原始社会的生产力水平很低，生产品没有剩余。这时不可能出现脑力劳动与体力劳动的分工，因为社会拿不出东西来养活脑力劳动者。由于生产力的水平很低，这时社会还没有脱离蒙昧和野蛮的状态，生产经验和社会生活都是极为简单的，因此也没有产生专门从事脑力劳动的需要。和这种情况相适应，原始社会的精神文化是极度贫乏的，原始的宗教和艺术是原始社会的晚期才出现的，而作为脑力劳动重要手段的文字，则是没有的。
    生产力进一步发展，社会产品有了剩余，这才使一部分人能够从体力劳动当中脱身出来专门从事脑力劳动。由于生产力的发展，生产经验和社会生活也逐渐复杂化了，这就产生了专门从事脑力劳动的需要。于是原始社会的劳动分而为二：极大多数人承当起繁重的体力劳动，一小部分人则专门从事脑力劳动。
    统一的劳动分而为二，是不是剥削阶级“硬生生地”把它分开的呢？不是的。如果社会生产没有达到一定的水平，如果社会没有产生这种分工的客观需要，谁也没有这样大的本领能够“硬生生地”制造出这种分工来。
    阶级的分裂使分工成为对抗的关系
    当然，阶级关系对这个分工是有作用的，这就是更加扩大了和加深了两种劳动之间的差别，并使这种分工成为一种对抗的关系。负担着全部体力劳动的是被剥削阶级，而有条件从事脑力劳动的只是剥削阶级和它的知识分子。其实如果把管理国家除外，剥削阶级一般并不去从事脑力劳动，而是过着寄生的生活。从事脑力劳动的，主要是知识分子。知识分子的经济地位和政治态度并不一致，所以就脑力劳动者和体力劳动者的关系来说，不能一概而论。但是就脑力劳动和体力劳动的一般关系来说，却是一种对抗的关系。为什么呢？脑力劳动之所以能够作为社会分工的一个部门而单独存在，必须有体力劳动为它提供物质条件。但是在阶级社会当中，脑力劳动和体力劳动这两个部门之间的物质交换，是经过剥削这个途径进行的。这就是说，剥削阶级从劳动人民那里把他们的劳动成果夺取过来，又从中拿出一部分来供养知识分子。尽管知识分子当中有些人的生活条件比劳动人民强不了多少，我们一般也不能说知识分子“剥削”劳动人民，但是总的说来，这两个劳动部门之间转移财富的方式，是通过剥削而实现的。阶级剥削是使脑力劳动和体力劳动的关系成为对抗的根源。
    阶级对抗对脑力劳动和体力劳动分工的影响，从其他方面也可以看得出来，比如科学技术的发明创造，本来是一件大有益于生产发展的事情，然而在阶级社会当中，它却成为加强剥削的手段。文学艺术的成就丰富了社会的精神生活，但是实际上能够享受这项成果的，主要是剥削阶级。当然，也不能把这一点理解得太极端了，劳动人民对于文化生活也不是根本不能问津的。不过总的说来，在阶级社会中，脑力劳动和体力劳动的关系，实质上是一种对抗的关系。
    但是对抗只是这个分工的一个特点，它不能代表整个脑力劳动和体力劳动的分工，因此不能说阶级造成这个分工，而只能说阶级关系使这种分工成为对抗。
      分工是历史上的伟大进步
    对于这个分工的出现，必须承认它是一个伟大的进步。人类社会之由野蛮进入文明，两种劳动的分工是一个极为重要的标志。以后人类社会物质文化和精神文化的进步，都和这种分工有分不开的关系。当然这个进步的代价也是相当沉重的，它使绝大多数人们丧失了自由，陷于被压迫、被剥削、终身从事苦役的境地。不过这个分工虽然采取了这样野蛮的形式，它究竟是当时唯一可行的道路。这正如恩格斯所说，人类为了从野兽般的生存条件当中挣脱出来，不得不采取几乎是野兽般的手段：使绝大多数人陷入受奴役的地位，来换取一小部分人的自由。这种方式虽然野蛮得惊人，但比起原始社会，究竟有它进步的地方。
    我们不应当把原始社会过分美化了，因为那是非历史的态度。原始社会由于没有私有制和剥削，所以也没有阶级社会那些奇形怪状，人们的道德面貌也是私有者和剥削者望尘莫及的。但是所有这些，归根结底不过是生产力极度低下的产物。原始社会的劳动当然没有阶级社会那种强制的性质，在一定意义上可以说劳动是具有自由的特色，但是这种劳动和共产主义劳动显然不可同日而语，它是极度落后的，因此严格说来不能称之为“脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合”，而只能叫作原始的劳动。当然，也不能小看原始社会的劳动，人之所以能从动物界分离出来，地球上之所以出现人类社会，正是这种原始的、朴素的劳动的功绩。第一把石斧和第一次使用火，在人类历史上的意义决不下于后来科学技术上任何一次最重大的发明。但是历史是往前走的，在原始社会朴素的劳动的基础上，脑力劳动终于作为一个独立部门分化出来。古代的天文学、数学、物理学、农艺学以及哲学和艺术方面的成就，如果不是这个分工，是不能出现的。古代社会生产的发展，那些至今屹立的高大建筑，如果不是大规模地使用奴隶劳动，如果没有脑力劳动的成果在生产中的应用，是根本办不到的。这里不但脑力劳动是一个新的形态，就是体力劳动，也不再是原始社会那种原始的、落后的形态了，这时，不论生产工具和劳动组织，都比原始社会大大前进了一步。当然，另一方面，从原始的自由劳动变成强制的奴隶劳动，又是这个进步的反面。总之，这个过程，既不以被剥削阶级的意志为转移，同样也不是剥削阶级所能左右的。
        分工也带来了恶果
    这个分工带来了进步，也带来了惊人的恶果。
    为了在认识世界和改造世界方面前进一步，脑力劳动和体力劳动分离开来，在生产力有所发展而又不太发展的条件下是必要的。但是知识的来源是实践，所以这种分工一开始就包含着致命的弱点：知识分子脱离了物质生产，并且也看不起体力劳动；劳动者没有享受文化教育的权利，而且被剥削的地位也使他们失去了推动生产和过问科学技术的兴趣。这种分工既然使人人都成为片面发展的人，因此它对物质生产和精神文化的发展，必然成为一种阻碍。事情总是在矛盾中前进。当脑力劳动和体力劳动的分工作为一个进步的因素出现的时候，它同时又成为一种阻碍的力量。经过奴隶社会、封建社会、资本主义社会，这个分工得到极大的发展，同时它的恶果也得到极大的发展。但是物极必反，这个分工本身的发展又给它自己的消灭准备了条件。
    在资本主义社会，脑力劳动和体力劳动的分工发展到了顶点。科学、文化、技术的发展以及其中有价值的成果在生产中的应用，都达到很高的成就，但同时生产者也完全沦为机器的一个附属物。这是事情的一个方面。另一方面，大工业生产越是发展，就越要求生产者有越来越高的科学技术水平。于是事情就成了这个样子：脑力劳动和体力劳动的分工推动了生产的发展，生产的发展又进一步要求消灭这种分工。
    仅仅“要求”还不行，还必须有这样一种物质条件，这条件使这种分工的消灭成为可能。这种条件，在生产力高度发展的资本主义社会已经基本上准备好了：这时生产力的水平已经有可能保证每个劳动者都有机会享受充分的文化教育。但是尽管生产力怎样发展，脑力劳动和体力劳动的分工仍然不能消灭，于是出路就只有进行社会主义革命。
          消灭分工的条件
    社会主义革命消灭了剥削阶级，因而也就扫除了脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的社会障碍。但是阶级压迫并不是这个分工产生的根源，所以社会主义革命只能消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的对抗（这一点与阶级联系着），而它们的分工或差别还要保存下来。这个分工要保存多久，归根到底要看生产力发展的程度。生产力的水平在社会主义革命前已经很高的国家，消灭这个分工的期间要短些。但是即使如此，普遍提高劳动人民的文化水平，使一切过去脱离生产劳动的人们都成为劳动者，也还需要一个相当长的期间。而这些事情也正是社会主义阶段的任务。等到社会生产极大地发展了，社会产品极大地丰富了，全民教育普及并且提高了，人民群众的思想觉悟和道德品质都极大地提高了，这时，人人都参加生产劳动，人人都有高度的文化水平，脑力劳动和体力劳动的分工也就消灭了。这正是进入共产主义社会的时候。
