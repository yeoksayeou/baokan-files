    We Woke Up Spring
    Bīng Xīn
    Spring in the seasons, like a sleepy child, is soundly asleep under the warm, soft duvet of winter.
    However, the Chinese people, who are seizing every second to extract wealth from nature, are unwilling to let him sleep in! Six hundred and fifty million people have agreed to wake him up with various loud noises and earth-shattering actions.
    Heavy snow is flying. The biting north wind raises knife-like sand and dust on the earth... We carry the ever-present spring in our hearts, and in groups, we go to every corner of the motherland to wake up the spring in the seasons.
    We have mined spring in the mines, refined spring in the furnaces, dried spring in the salt fields, built spring on the dams, woven spring on the spinning machines, built spring on the railways in the deserts, dredged spring in the turbulent oceans, sung spring on the bright red lips, and written spring under the waving pens...
    Spring rubs his eyes and sits up, his face full of surprised smiles: "For tens of thousands of years, I have slept enough, flown out of the cave of winter, and touched you and awakened you with the green grass, the gurgling of thawing rivers, and the colorful fragrant flowers... Now everything is reversed, great are you, the people who build socialism!"
    Spring, riding the whistling spring breeze, holding the waving spring banner, flew high.
    In the rustling sound of the spring banner, everything on the earth was awakened.
    The Kunlun Mountains, the continuous ten-thousand-foot peaks, carrying towering ice and snow, insert into the blue sky. The hot sea-like spring air surrounds it, warms it, it smiles and yawns, the snow coat on its body unfolds and melts; hundreds of millions of ice beads loosen into ten-thousand-foot torrents, laughing loudly, jumping off the towering cliffs, rushing down. It flows into the Yellow River, into the Yangtze River, into the silver-net-like large and small rivers. There, hundreds of millions of impatient men and women, old and young, wearing headscarves or work clothes, are already waiting, sleeves rolled up, full of spring breeze, welcoming it, bringing it to the shallow reservoirs and canals, bringing it to the thirsty, boundless land.
    This boundless land, released from the cold grip of severe winter by thousands of roaring plows and hundreds of millions of silver-shining hoes waving up and down. It opens its dark chest, panting, waiting for its food.
    Hundreds of millions of dan of fertilizer: gathered from pigsties, cowsheds, factory boilers, corners of people's houses... one cart after another, one load after another, are delivered. The earth devours it greedily, wiping the greasy corners of its mouth and the sweat on its face, stands up, and stretches out its strong arms to embrace thousands upon thousands of fat children, holding them tightly in its arms.
    These are the children of rice, the children of wheat, the children of cotton... laughing and clamoring, crowding in this soft and deep chest, the fragrance of the soil makes them a little dizzy, they keep shaking and calling to each other, "Brothers and sisters, it's too crowded here, let us go out and disperse!"
    Faintly, they heard the sound of the spring banner waving in the high sky; from thousands of tiny skylights, they saw the golden mist-like spring sunshine.
    They jumped for joy! They drilled upward with all their might, finally drilling out of the soil several feet deep. They stood still, took a deep breath of the spring air full of joy, and leisurely stretched out two tender green wings.
    Looking down on them, with affectionate and kind eyes, are young women with floral headscarves laughing with dimples, young men in work clothes with smiling faces, and old grandfathers holding pipes pointing and praising...
    It turns out they are already impatient!
    Spring saw all this in the high sky. He smiled and said to himself: "You people who live twenty years as one day, you are chasing time, and time is chasing you!..."
    Spring shouldered the spring banner and hurried on his way in the clouds. We have no time to care whether he is going to which high mountain, which plain, or which ocean in the motherland to do his work!
    Anyway, we have already woken up spring!

    我们把春天吵醒了
    冰心
    季候上的春天，像一个困倦的孩子，在冬天温暖轻软的绒被下，安稳地合目睡眠。
    但是，向大自然索取财富、分秒必争的中国人民，是不肯让他多睡懒觉的！六亿五千万人商量好了，用各种洪大的声音和震天撼地的动作来把他吵醒。
    大雪纷飞。砭骨的朔风，扬起大地上尖刀般的沙土……我们心里带着永在的春天，成群结队地在祖国的各个角落里，去吵醒季候上的春天。
    我们在矿山里开出了春天，在火炉里炼出了春天，在盐场上晒出了春天，在水坝上砌起了春天，在纺机上织出了春天，在沙漠的铁路上筑起了春天，在汹涌的海洋里捞出了春天，在鲜红的唇上唱出了春天，在挥舞的笔下写出了春天……
    春天揉着眼睛坐起来了，脸上充满了惊讶的微笑：“几万年来，都是我睡足了，飞出冬天的洞穴，用青青的草色，用潺潺的解冻的河流，用万紫千红的香花……来触动你们，唤醒你们。如今一切都翻转了，伟大呵，你们这些建设社会主义的人们！”
    春天，驾着呼啸的春风，拿起招展的春幡，高高地飞起了。
    哗啦啦的春幡吹卷声中，大地上一切都惊醒了。
    昆仑山，连绵不断的万丈高峰，载着峨峨的冰雪，插入青天。热海般的春气围绕着它，温暖着它，它微笑地欠伸了，身上的雪衣抖开了，融化了；亿万粒的冰珠松解成万丈的洪流，大声地欢笑着，跳下高耸的危崖，奔涌而下。它流入黄河，流入长江，流入银网般的大大小小的江河。在那里，早有亿万个等得不耐烦的、包着头或是穿着工作服的男女老幼，揎拳掳袖满面春风地在迎接着，把它带到清浅的水库里、水渠里，带到干渴的无边大地里。
    这无边的大地，让几千架的隆隆的翻土机，几亿把上下挥动银光闪烁的锄头，把它从严冬冰冷的紧握下，解放出来了。它敞开黝黑的胸膛，喘息着，等待着它的食粮。
    亿万担的肥料：从猪圈里，牛棚里，工厂的锅炉里，人家的屋角里……聚集起来了，一车接着一车，一担连着一担地送来了。大地狼吞虎咽地吃饱了，擦一擦流油的嘴角和脸上的汗珠，站了起来，伸出坚强的双臂来接抱千千万万肥肥胖胖的孩子，把他们紧紧地搂在怀里。
    这些是米的孩子，麦的孩子，棉花的孩子……笑笑嚷嚷地挤在这松软深阔的胸膛里，泥土的香气，熏得他们有点发昏，他们不住地彼此摇撼呼唤着叫：“弟兄们，姊妹们，这里面太挤了，让我们出去疏散疏散吧！”
    隐隐地他们听到了高空中春幡招展的声音；从千万扇细小的天窗里，他们看到了金雾般的春天的阳光。
    他们乐得一跳多高！他们一个劲地往上钻，好容易钻出几尺深的泥土。他们站住了，深深地吸了一口春天的充满了欢乐的香气，悠然地伸开两片嫩绿的翅叶。
    俯在他们上面，用爱怜亲切的眼光注视着他们的，有包着花布头巾笑出酒涡来的大姑娘，也有穿着工作服的眉花眼笑的小伙子，也有举着烟袋在指点夸说的老爷爷……
    原来他们又已经等得不耐烦了！
    春天在高空中把这一切都看在眼里。他笑着自言自语地说：“这些把二十年当作一天来过的人，你们在赶时间，时间也在赶你们！……”
    春天掮上春幡赶快又走他的云中的路。他是到祖国的哪一座高山，哪一处平原，或是哪一片海洋上去做他的工作，我们也没有工夫去管他了！
    横竖我们已经把春天吵醒了！
