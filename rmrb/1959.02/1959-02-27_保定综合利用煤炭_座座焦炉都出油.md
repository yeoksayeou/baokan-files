Baoding Comprehensively Utilizes Coal
    Every Coke Oven Produces Oil

    (Reported by this newspaper) Baoding City, Hebei Province, is paying attention to the comprehensive utilization of coal while developing coke production. All of the city's six coking plants, with their more than 500 coke ovens, have achieved a situation where every oven produces coke and oil. From the beginning of October last year to January 27th this year, a total of more than 110 tons of coal tar has been recovered. From this, 40 kinds of products have been processed, including gasoline, kerosene, light diesel, heavy diesel, transformer oil, paraffin wax, lubricating grease, crude phenol, benzene, iron oxide red, and ammonium sulfate. After testing, the quality of most products meets the standards. The gasoline produced has already begun to be used in automobiles.

    In August and September last year, with the development of the nationwide mass steel production movement, Baoding City built six coking plants. In order to prevent coal tar from escaping with the smoke, each coking plant put forward the slogan "More coke should be produced, and no oil should be lost," mobilizing workers to find ways to recover coal tar. Each plant organized technical research teams and launched a competition. The Baoding Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also mobilized municipal departments to send more than 2,000 chimney sections to the coking plants, which further encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers. Without cement for cooling pools, the workers used buckets, wooden boxes, large jars, and large helmets as substitutes. They also created various coolers, such as double-pipe and spring-type coolers, solving the problem of insufficient equipment. Yu Guoxiang and more than 20 other employees of the Baoding Municipal Commercial Bureau Coking Plant, developed a daring spirit, and after visiting and learning from various places, used large gasoline drums to make distillation kettles and processed 40 kinds of products, including oils, chemical raw materials, and fertilizers.

    Currently, the movement for the comprehensive utilization of coal has been deeply developed throughout the city. In order to improve the coal tar recovery rate, the Second Coking Plant of the Baoding Municipal Commercial Bureau implemented natural draft combined collection for 11 Zhongxing-style round kilns. The coal tar recovery rate reached 0.41% of the coal loaded, which was 0.11% higher than the single-kiln recovery rate. Dynamic draft combined collection was implemented for 40 Zhongxing-style round kilns, and the coal tar recovery rate reached 1% to 1.5% of the coal loaded, which was four times higher than the single-kiln recovery rate. The Commercial Bureau built a new coal tar refining plant with an annual processing capacity of 600 tons of coal tar and has already put it into production. More than 50 family members of workers at the Baoding Railway Locomotive Depot built two heaped dry distillation kilns with an annual output of 300 tons of coal tar. They have now produced 27 tons of coal tar and more than 590 tons of semi-coke. (Photo attached)

    The Baoding Coking Plant uses indigenous methods to recover coal tar, using chimneys instead of tank pipe equipment, and water buckets instead of cement cooling pools. Each kiln can recover 400 jin of coal tar. Workers use this coal tar to trial-produce more than 30 products such as gasoline, kerosene, light and heavy diesel.

    This is the chimney erected on the indigenous coking furnace to recover coal tar, which is recovering coal tar.

    保定综合利用煤炭
    座座焦炉都出油
    本报讯　河北省保定市在发展焦炭生产的同时，注意综合利用煤炭。全市六个炼焦厂的五百多座焦窑，实现了窑窑出焦必出油。从去年10月开始，截至今年1月27日，共回收焦油一百一十多吨，从中已加工出汽油、煤油、轻柴油、重柴油、变压器油、石腊、润滑脂、粗酚、苯、铁氧红、硫酸氨等四十种产品，经过化验，产品质量大部合乎标准。所产汽油已经开始供汽车使用。
    去年8、9月间，随着全民大搞钢铁运动的开展，保定市兴建起六个炼焦厂。为了不使焦油随烟跑掉，各焦厂提出了“焦要多出，油也不丢”的口号，发动职工想办法回收焦油。各厂组织了技术研究小组，发起了竞赛运动。中共保定市委还发动市直机关抽调二千多节烟筒送到焦厂，这更鼓舞了广大职工的干劲。没有水泥作冷却池，职工们便用水桶、木箱、大缸、大盔等代替。他们还创制了双管式、弹簧式等各种冷却器，解决了设备不足的困难。保定市商业局炼焦厂于国祥等二十多名职工，发扬了敢想、敢干的风格，经过在各地参观学习，用大汽油桶制成蒸馏釜，并加工制成油类、化工原料、肥料等各种产品四十种。
    目前，广泛综合利用煤炭的运动已在全市深入展开。保定市商业局第二炼焦厂为提高焦油回收率，对十一座中兴式圆窑实行了自然抽风联采，焦油回收率达装窑煤量的0.41％，比单窑回收率提高了0.11％；对四十个中兴式圆窑实行了动力抽风联采，焦油回收率达装煤量的1％至1.5％，比单窑回收提高四倍。商业局新建起了焦油精炼厂一座，全年可加工焦油六百吨，并已投入生产。保定铁路机务段五十多名职工家属建成了两座年产焦油三百吨的成堆干馏窑，现在已生产焦油二十七吨，半焦五百九十多吨。（附图片）
    保定市炼焦厂用土法回收焦油，没有缸管设备用烟筒来代替，没有水泥冷却池用水桶来代替。每烧一窑可回收焦油四百斤。工人们利用这些焦油试制成汽油、煤油、轻、重柴油等三十多种产品。
    这是在土法炼焦炉上架起的回收焦油的烟筒正在回收焦油。
