Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 16th. The Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory Party Committee, in leading the teaching reform of the workers' school, not only organizes teachers to participate in workshop production labor but also requires teaching to follow the mass line combining teachers, workers, and engineering technicians, so that workers' education is more closely integrated with production and theory is better linked to practice.

The worker's school run by the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory has a half-day mechanical college and half-day and spare-time secondary vocational schools. Most teachers previously lacked practical production knowledge, so their teaching was divorced from production and from reality to a considerable extent. The factory's Party Committee saw this, and last year organized teachers to go to the workshops to participate in production labor. Through laboring together with the workers, the teachers' political awareness and production knowledge have improved, and some teachers have even enriched the teaching materials with some of the problems they collected in the workshops. This made a good start for the teaching reform of the workers' school.

In view of the above situation, this year the factory's Party Committee further decided that while teachers participate in workshop labor, they should also extensively and deeply "collect material" from workers and frequently solicit opinions from engineering technicians so that teaching can better cater to the needs of workers in production.

So far, the factory's teachers, in going deep into the workshops and among the worker masses to "collect material," have gathered nearly a thousand comments, methods, suggestions, and questions related to the improvement of courses such as language, mathematics, physics and chemistry, and drawing. Based on these suggestions, opinions, and questions, teachers can first start from the needs of production when compiling new teaching syllabuses and textbooks, so that workers can learn both theoretical knowledge and extensive and rich practical production knowledge in their studies. The drawing course teachers even send the newly compiled teaching materials to the workshop for workers to discuss. Previously, the mathematics, physics, and chemistry teachers of the secondary vocational school always felt that mathematics, physics, and chemistry were theoretical foundation courses, and it was relatively difficult to combine them with production practice. However, after participating in workshop labor and "collecting material" from the worker masses in the workshop, they found that the relationship between mathematics, physics, and chemistry and production is very close, thus finding a way to combine the teaching of these two courses with production and link theory with practice.

### 工厂办学走群众路线  重庆建设机床厂职工学校教师深入车间采风

    工厂办学走群众路线 
    重庆建设机床厂职工学校教师深入车间采风
    新华社重庆16日电　中共重庆建设机床厂党委在领导职工学校教学改革中，既组织教师参加车间生产劳动、又要求教学走教师、工人、工程技术人员相结合的群众路线，使职工教育更密切结合生产、理论更好地联系实际。
    重庆建设机床厂厂办的职工学校有半日制机械学院和半日制与业余的中等专业学校。大多数教师过去缺乏生产实际知识，因此在教学中脱离生产，脱离实际比较严重。工厂党委看到了这一点，去年曾组织教师们下车间参加生产劳动。通过和工人共同劳动，教师们的政治觉悟和生产知识都有提高，一些教师还把自己在车间里收集到的部分问题充实到教材里去了。为职工学校进行教学改革作了一个良好的开端。
    鉴于上述情况，今年工厂党委进一步决定教师在参加车间劳动的同时，还要广泛地、深入地向工人进行“采风”，和经常征求工程技术人员的意见，以便在教学中能更多地照顾工人生产上的需要。
    到目前为止，这个工厂的教师们在深入车间、深入工人群众“采风”中已采集了近千条有关语文、数学、理化、制图等课程的改进意见、办法、建议和问题。根据这些建议、意见和问题教师们在新编教学大纲和教材时，都能够首先从生产需要出发，使工人在学习中既能学到理论知识，又能学到广泛、丰富的生产实际知识。制图课教师还把新编的教材送到车间去交给工人讨论。中等专业学校的数学、理化教师，以前总觉得数学、理化是理论基础课，结合生产实际比较困难。但当他们参加车间劳动和在车间向工人群众“采风”以后，发现数学、理化与生产的关系非常密切，从而找到了这两门课程教学结合生产、理论联系实际的门路。
