    The Style of Pine Trees
    Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

    Last winter, on my way from Yingde to Lianxian, I saw pine trees all along the way, lush and green, full of life, standing proudly. Although I was sitting in a car, and the pine trees flashed by one after another, their posture, unafraid of wind, frost, and cold, filled me with respect and lingered in my memory. At that time, I wanted to write down this feeling, but I couldn't. A few days ago, when I was in a discussion with teachers and students of the Chinese Department of Zhongshan University in Humen, I talked about this issue again, hoping that young comrades can be like pine trees, growing into people with the style of pine trees, that is, people with a communist style. Now I write down my feelings at that time to share with everyone.

    My respect for pine trees did not begin today. Since ancient times, many people have praised them, admired them, and used them as symbols of noble qualities.

    Look at them, whether in the crevices of cliffs or on barren land, as long as there is a seed—and this seed, whether you intentionally planted it or casually dropped it; whether it was blown by the wind or fell from the beak of a bird—in short, as long as there is a seed, it will grow vigorously anytime, anywhere, regardless of the terrain, unafraid of severe cold and heat. It doesn't need anyone to fertilize or deworm it, nor does it need anyone to water or irrigate it. Strong winds cannot knock it down, floods cannot submerge it, severe cold cannot freeze it to death, and drought cannot wither it. It just grows carefree. The vitality of pine trees is truly strong! The demands of pine trees on people are truly few! This is one of the reasons why I feel respect whenever I see pine trees.

    An even more important reason for my respect for pine trees is their spirit of self-sacrifice. Look, the leaves of pine trees can be used to extract oil; the trunk of pine trees is widely used as timber and is a good raw material for papermaking; the resin of pine trees can be used to make rosin and turpentine, which are important industrial raw materials; and the roots and branches of pine trees are good fuel. Not to mention that in summer, it uses its branches and leaves to block the scorching sun, allowing people to rest in the shade; and in the dark night, it can be split into pieces and made into torches to illuminate people's way forward. In a word, for the sake of mankind, it has indeed reached the point of "pulverizing its bones."

    Demanding very little from people and giving a lot to people, this is the style of pine trees.

    Lu Xun's saying, "What I eat is grass, what I squeeze out is milk and blood," is a true reflection of the style of pine trees.

    Of course, the style of pine trees also includes its spirit of optimism. Look at it, whether in severe cold, frost, and snow or in the scorching summer sun, it is always full of energy and never knows what it means to be melancholy or fearful.

    I often think: Willows are graceful and charming, and can be described as extremely enchanting; peaches and plums are splendid and colorful, and can be described as extremely bright, but the impression they give people is only a kind of "good-looking" appearance and cannot give people strength. Pine trees are different; they may not be as good-looking as willows, peaches, and plums, but they give people inspiration, deep thought, and courage, especially when you think of their noble style, you can't help but feel respect.

    Every time I see pine trees and think of their noble style, I think of the communist style.

    I think: The so-called communist style should be a style that demands very little from people but gives a lot to people; the so-called communist style should be a style of not fearing any sacrifice for the sake of the people's interests and cause.

    Everyone with a communist style should be like a pine tree, growing vigorously and working tenaciously in any harsh environment, never being intimidated by difficulties, and never succumbing to adverse environments. Everyone with a communist style should have the noble qualities of a pine tree. Whatever the people need us to do, we will do it. As long as it is for the benefit of the people, we will not hesitate to crush our bodies and brave boiling water and flames; and we will have no complaints, always brimming with the spirit of revolutionary optimism.

    There are many people with this communist style. In the difficult years of the revolution, in the days of white terror, no matter how harsh the environment and how dangerous the situation, how many people endured hardships and did meaningful work for the happiness of the people! They contributed all their energy, even their most precious lives. Even in the last moment before their sacrifice, they were not thinking of themselves, but of the people and the future of the motherland, even the whole world. However, what did they demand from people? Nothing. This reminds us so much of the noble style of pine trees!

    At present, in the days of socialist construction, how many people, regardless of personal gains or losses, regardless of their personal health, are working day and night, neglecting sleep and forgetting food, sweating and bleeding to accelerate our socialist construction. In their minds, everything is for quickly changing our country's "poor and blank" face; everything is for accelerating our socialist construction. This reminds us so much of the noble style of pine trees!

    More and more people have this style. The more people like this, the faster our socialist construction will be. I hope everyone can have the strong will and noble qualities of pine trees; I hope everyone can become a person with a communist style.

### 松树的风格

    松树的风格
    中共广东省委第一书记  陶铸
    去年冬天，我从英德到连县去，沿途看到松树郁郁苍苍，生气勃勃，傲然屹立。虽是坐在车子上，一棵棵松树一晃而过，但对它那种不畏风霜寒冷的姿态，却使人油然而生敬意，久久不忘。当时很想把这种感觉写下来，但又不能写成，前两天在虎门和中山大学中文系的师生们座谈时，又谈到这个问题，希望青年同志们能和松树一样，成长为具有松树的风格，也就是具有共产主义风格的人。现在把当时的感觉写出来，与大家共勉。
    我对松树怀有敬佩之心自不从今日始。自古以来，多少人歌颂过它，赞美过它，把它做为崇高的品质的象征。
    你看它不管是在悬崖的缝隙间也好，不管是在贫瘠的土地上也好，只要有一粒种子——这粒种子也不管是你有意种植的，还是随意丢落的；也不管是风吹来的，还是从飞鸟的嘴里跌落的，总之，只要有一粒种子，它就不择地势，不畏严寒酷热，随时随处茁强地生长起来了。它既不需要谁来施肥除虫，也不需要谁来浇水灌溉。狂风吹不倒它，洪水淹不没它，严寒冻不死它，干旱旱不坏它。它只是一味地无忧无虑地生长。松树的生命力可谓强矣！松树要求于人的可谓少矣！这是我每看到松树油然而生敬意的原因之一。
    我对松树怀有敬意的更重要的原因却是它那种自我牺牲的精神。你看，松树的叶子可以榨油；松树的干是用途极广的木材，并是很好的造纸的原料；松树的脂液可制松香、松节油，是很重要的工业原料；松树的根与枝又是很好的燃料。更不用说在夏天它自己用枝叶挡住炎炎烈日，叫人们在绿荫如盖下休憩；在黑夜，它可以劈成碎片做成火把，照亮人们前进的路。总之一句话，为了人类，它的确是做到了“粉身碎骨”的地步了。
    要求于人的甚少，给予人的甚多，这就是松树的风格。
    鲁迅先生说的“我吃的是草，挤出来的是牛奶、血。”正是松树的风格的写照。
    自然，松树的风格中还包含有它的乐观主义的精神。你看它无论在严寒霜雪与盛夏烈日中，总是精神奕奕，从来都不知道什么叫做忧郁与畏惧。
    我常想：杨柳婀娜多姿；可谓妩媚极了；桃李绚烂多采，可谓鲜艳极了，但它们给人的印象只是一种“好看”的外表，不能给人以力量。松树却不同，它可能不如杨柳与桃李那么好看，但他却给人以启发，以深思和勇气，尤其是想到它那种崇高的风格的时候，不由人不油然而生敬意。
    我每次看到松树想到它那种崇高的风格的时候，就联想到共产主义风格。
    我想：所谓共产主义风格，应该就是要求人的甚少，而给予人的却甚多的风格；所谓共产主义风格，应该就是为了人民的利益和事业不畏任何牺牲的风格。
    每一个具有共产主义风格的人，都应该像松树一样，不管在怎样恶劣的环境下，都应该茁强地生长，顽强地工作，永不被困难吓倒，永不屈服于恶劣环境。每一个具有共产主义风格的人，都应该具有像松树那样的崇高品质，人民需要我们做什么，我们就去做什么，只要是为了人民的利益，粉身碎骨，赴汤蹈火也在所不计；而且毫无怨言，永远浑身洋溢着革命的乐观主义的精神。
    具有这种共产主义风格的人是很多的。在革命艰苦的年代里，在白色恐怖的日子里，多少人不管环境的恶劣和情况的险恶，为了人民的幸福，他们忍受了多少的艰难困苦，做了多少有意义的工作啊！他们贡献出所有的精力，甚至最宝贵的生命。就是在他们临牺牲前最后的一霎那间，他们想的不是自己，而是人民和祖国甚至全世界的将来。然而，他们要求于人的是什么呢？什么也没有。这多使我们想起松树的崇高的风格！
    目前，在社会主义建设的日子里，多少人不顾个人的得失，不顾个人的健康，夜以继日，废寝忘食，为加速我们的社会主义建设流汗流血的苦干着。在他们的意念中，一切都是为了迅速改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌；一切都是为了加速我们的社会主义建设。这又多使我们想起松树的崇高的风格！
    具有这种风格的人们是越来越多了。这样的人越多，我们的社会主义建设也就会越快。我希望每个人都能像松树一样具有坚强的意志和崇高的品质；我希望每一个人都成为具有共产主义风格的人。
