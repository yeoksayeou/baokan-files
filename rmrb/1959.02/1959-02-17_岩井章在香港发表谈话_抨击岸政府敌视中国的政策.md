Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 16th: Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, told Xinhua reporters today that the Japanese people oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's hostile China policy. He said: The Japanese people have consistently demanded the establishment of friendly relations, trade relations, and cultural exchanges with China. Therefore, the Kishi Nobusuke government's hostile China policy is contrary to the wishes of the Japanese people.

Iwai Akira and Koyama Ryoji, Director of the Political Department of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, arrived in Hong Kong this afternoon from Guangzhou. At the invitation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, they visited China from January 29 to February 16.

When interviewed by Xinhua reporters, Iwai Akira stated that the Kishi Nobusuke government's so-called trade being separated from politics was a deception aimed at deceiving the Japanese people. He said: "Because the Japanese people's demand for the restoration of friendly and trade relations with China is growing stronger, the Kishi Nobusuke government has to make some superficial efforts to alleviate popular discontent." He emphasized: "Neither trade relations nor political relations can proceed without friendship from both sides."

Iwai Akira said that the Kishi Nobusuke government should bear full responsibility for the many difficulties caused to the Japanese economy by the severance of Japan-China trade.

When talking about the current movement of the Japanese people against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," Iwai Akira said that the movement includes a very broad range of classes, its strength is very powerful, and it has now put Kishi Nobusuke in a difficult situation.

Iwai Akira visited the People's Communes during his visit to China. He said that the People's Communes are of great help to production. Chinese farmers have happily accepted this form, they are working happily, and they are full of confidence in their bright future.

    岩井章在香港发表谈话  
    抨击岸政府敌视中国的政策
    指出日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的力量强大
    新华社香港16日电　日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章今天对新华社记者说，日本人民反对岸信介政府敌视中国的政策。他说：日本人民一贯要求与中国建立友好关系、贸易关系并进行文化交流。因此，岸信介政府所执行的敌视中国的政策是与日本人民的愿望相违背的。
    岩井章和日本工会总评议会政治部长小山良治是今天下午从广州到达香港的。他们应中华全国总工会的邀请，在1月29日到2月16日的期间访问了中国。
    岩井章在新华社记者访问他的时候表示，岸信介政府所谓政治和经济分开来进行贸易的谰调，目的是为了欺骗日本人民。他说：“由于日本人民要求与中国恢复友好和贸易关系的力量越来越大，岸信介政府不能不作一些表面功夫，用来缓和人民的不满”。他强调说：“不论贸易关系或是政治关系，假如缺乏双方的友好是无法进行的”。
    岩井章说：由于日中贸易的断绝，给日本经济造成了许多困难，这个责任应该完全由岸信介政府承担。
    在谈到目前日本人民反对修改日美“安全条约”的运动时，岩井章说：这个运动所包括的阶层非常广泛，力量很强大，现在已经使岸信介走入困境。
    岩井章在我国访问时曾参观了人民公社。他说：人民公社对生产有很大帮助，中国的农民很高兴地接受了这种形式，他们愉快地进行工作，并且对他们的美好将来满怀信心。
