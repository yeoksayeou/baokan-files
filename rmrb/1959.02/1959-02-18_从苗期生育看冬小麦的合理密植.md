In 1959, winter wheat production has seen a great leap forward from the very beginning. Taking the northern winter wheat region as an example, generally the land is deeply ploughed to about one foot, with more than 10,000 catties of base fertilizer applied per mu, and a sowing rate of more than 30 catties per mu, which is about double that of the past. Winter wheat high-yield cultivation technology, with close planting as the center, deep ploughing as the foundation, and water and fertilizer as the prerequisite, has been further developed. The sowing rate in high-yield experimental fields in various places ranges from 60 to 70 catties to 1,000 catties per mu, and the cultivation measures taken are also diverse. Under such disparate sowing densities, what changes will occur in the growth of winter wheat? What is the appropriate limit to exceed how much density? What should be done after over-densification? These are urgent problems to be solved in current production and scientific research. This is of great significance for further guiding large-area high-yield and high-yield production of winter and spring wheat, and ensuring a greater harvest this year.

    The Rational Limit of Close Planting of Wheat

Close planting can increase production, but it does not mean that the denser the better. When the sowing density is increased within a certain range, the total number of plants per unit area increases, allowing for more sufficient and effective use of sunlight, air, and other nutrient conditions, appropriately controlling the number of tillers, consolidating early tillers, reducing ineffective tillers, and increasing the main ear rate, thereby achieving more and larger ears and increasing yield. Exceeding a certain range will seriously affect the normal growth of individual plants, not only failing to increase production but also leading to reduced production. According to the statistical results of our sampling survey of 183 high-yield fields in various places, as the sowing density increases, the number of tillers per plant, the number of leaves per plant, the dry weight of the above-ground part of the plant (the weight of the above-ground part of the seedling after being dried to remove moisture), the carbohydrate content at the base of the leaves and leaf sheaths (the cylindrical part below the leaves), the dry weight per unit leaf area, the number of primary roots (roots that germinate after the seed absorbs moisture, also known as seed roots) per plant, the number of secondary roots (roots that grow to absorb nutrients from the soil, also known as permanent roots) per plant, the proportion of plants with secondary roots, the thickness of the roots, and the dry weight of the root system per plant all decrease accordingly. On the other hand, the proportion of un-tillered plants, the weak seedling rate (referring to plants that are very weak and difficult to survive), plant height, the length of the "ting" (appearing like a stem, but actually composed of the extended leaf sheaths of the stem leaves, called "ting" by the masses), and the length/width ratio of each leaf above the second leaf of the main stem all increase with the increase in density. When the sowing density is 1 million to 1.5 million plants per mu, more than one-third of the plants do not tiller, and weak seedlings that are difficult to survive begin to appear (accounting for 1.5%). From the perspective of the dry weight of the above-ground part of a single plant, there is no difference between sowing densities of 500,000 to 1.5 million plants, while the dry weight decreases significantly when the density increases to more than 1.5 million plants. The shape of the second and third leaves of the main stem also shows a similar situation, with the leaves becoming narrow and long, thin and watery, and the dry weight significantly reduced when exceeding 1.5 million plants. In the seed rate comparison test of our institute, the carbohydrate content of leaves was 14.8% when the sowing density was 1 million plants, 12.9% when it was 1.5 million plants, and 13% when it was 2 million plants. When the sowing density is more than 1.5 million plants, the number of primary and secondary roots per plant decreases, and the percentage of plants with secondary roots decreases significantly. Based on the above observations, a density of 1.5 million plants per mu (equivalent to sowing about 100 catties per mu) may be a turning point, and many characteristic features marking the seedling stage growth status will have obvious changes when the sowing density exceeds 1.5 million plants. The survey materials also indicate that the total number of tillers per mu, the total dry weight of the above-ground part of the plant, the total leaf area, and the total weight of the root system increase with the increase in sowing density. Taking the total number of tillers per mu as an example, the growth is very fast when the sowing density is within 2 million plants, slightly slower between 2.5 million and 5 million plants, and then increases again. Looking at the number of tillers per plant (excluding the main tiller), the number of tillers per plant is more than one when it is within 1.5 million plants, and the decrease is faster with the increase in density, and then there are very few tillers or even no tillers. Of course, it is too early to draw a conclusion on the rational density of winter wheat based on the current seedling stage growth, because this only reflects the growth of wheat seedlings before winter (and the pre-winter growth is greatly affected by the sowing period), and the growth of plants before and after early spring greening and jointing will inevitably change again, and the most reasonable sowing density will also vary with the change of conditions. But it can be said with certainty that the sowing density that the seedlings cannot adapt to in the seedling stage will have more problems after greening and jointing, and the growth will definitely be poor.

    Why does growth suffer after over-densification? The main reason is poor light and nutrition. According to observations by Beijing Agricultural University, in a high-yield experimental field with a sowing density of 3.5 million plants and a seedling height of one chi, the light intensity at one-third of the height of the plant from the ground is 230 meter-candles (a standard for measuring light intensity, i.e., one candle at a distance of one meter), and the light intensity at two-thirds of the height from the ground is 2,000 meter-candles, while in a general field with a seedling height of 15 centimeters, it is 13,000 meter-candles at one-third of the height from the ground and 24,000 meter-candles at two-thirds of the height from the ground, a difference of ten to dozens of times. According to the data of the Soviet plant physiologist Maksimov, the minimum light intensity for wheat to reach flowering and fruiting is 1,800-2,200 meter-candles. It can be seen that the early over-dense closure of high-yield experimental fields is very unfavorable. After the sowing density increases to a certain extent, the leaf area per unit land area is too large, and the light conditions for the middle and lower layers of leaves are very poor. The severely shaded leaves are almost no longer the synthetic organs of organic matter in the plant, but are transformed into consumers of organic matter. Therefore, to a large extent, it causes the weakening of photosynthetic intensity, the change of metabolic direction, and the inability to effectively accumulate nutrients. The changes in leaf color, thickness, dry weight per unit area, and carbohydrate content under different density conditions fully reflect this fact. Precisely because the plants are in a state of carbohydrate starvation, the formation of the root system is significantly inhibited, and the development of the root system in turn affects the growth of tillers. Due to over-densification, the above-ground parts are crowded with each other. The seedlings' stems and leaves, based on the characteristics of phototropism, always grow upwards to strive for light, thus the cells elongate, chlorophyll decreases, and the seedlings show the phenomenon of slender and weak etiolation. In the relationship between sowing density and light nutrition, we have also observed a phenomenon, that is, under the same density conditions, early sowing has fewer tillers and later secondary root emergence than late sowing. For example, in a survey of the cadre experimental field of the Beijing Municipal Planning Commission in Xiaotun, Fengtai, the ones sown on September 23 had more tillers and fewer yellow leaves than those sown on September 13; and in the ones sown on September 13, there were 5.7% weak seedlings and 9.8% plants with dead tillers at a density of 1.39 million plants, while there were no weak seedlings and dead tillers in those sown on September 23. This phenomenon was also observed in the high-yield experimental fields of our institute and the Biological Department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This may be because, under the combined influence of early sowing and other comprehensive cultivation conditions in high-yield experimental fields, the temperature is higher, the growth is rapid, and the seedlings begin to shade very early and to a severe degree, so that the formation of tillers and secondary roots is delayed or blocked. If the sowing is appropriately delayed, the temperature is lower, the growth is slow, the shading is lighter, and relatively speaking, it is more conducive to tillering and rooting. It should be added that, because the sowing periods of high-yield experimental fields in various places are different, the suitability of the sowing density is reflected differently in the pre-winter growth of wheat seedlings, thus adding more or less complexity to looking at rational close planting from the seedling stage. As for the fact that the diurnal temperature range is smaller, the nighttime temperature is slightly higher, and the relative humidity is also high, resulting in slightly stronger respiration, which is unfavorable for the accumulation of organic matter, this is not the main aspect of the contradiction. The key issue is still the daytime light conditions. In the case of close planting, any measures to improve the light and nutrition conditions of plants are beneficial. In addition, the rational density adapted to different regions should also be different due to differences in temperature, moisture, light, soil fertility, and cultivation conditions. For example, the rational sowing density in the southern winter wheat region should be smaller than that in the north.

    Strengthen Management of Densely Planted Wheat Fields

In response to the three different situations of winter wheat high-yield experimental fields, large-area high-yield fields, and general fields, the following suggestions are put forward:

    (1) High-yield experimental fields should master rational density

This year, due to the large sowing rate and high fertilization rate in high-yield experimental fields in various places, there has been more or less etiolation before winter. Even if there is no etiolation, the density must be appropriately controlled and field management strengthened to avoid etiolation and lodging in the spring. According to our survey results, it is preliminarily believed that, except for seed rate comparison experimental fields that are experimental research in nature, the density of general high-yield experimental fields should not exceed 1.5 million plants. For overly dense wheat fields, such as those with more than 2 million seedlings per mu, it is best to carry out seedling thinning as early as possible to facilitate the healthy growth of plants. Seedling thinning can be done by hand picking, hoeing, or harrowing. Pull out the weak seedlings and leave the strong seedlings, and appropriately leave gaps between rows to facilitate light penetration. At present, the soil in the northern winter wheat region is still frozen, which is not conducive to thinning, and it should be carried out when growth is restored in early spring. Seedling thinning is a last resort, and thinning is better than not thinning, and the effect depends on the subsequent growth. Those seedlings that have shown etiolation phenomenon need to be combined with leaf cutting to allow them to grow again. For seedlings with a density of 1 million to 1.5 million plants, if there is etiolation, leaf cutting can be used to inhibit growth, and thinning can also be carried out when necessary. According to our survey in Dasi Gezhuang, Xushui, Hebei on November 22, 1958, the method of leaf cutting has a certain inhibitory effect on high-yield experimental fields with etiolation. After cutting, the number of tillers per plant and the number of leaves both tend to increase, the "ting" length becomes shorter, and the wheat seedlings grow more healthily. In the spring of 1958, we conducted a survey at a base point in Meng County, Henan, and leaf cutting on wheat fields with early lodging tendencies had the effect of reducing lodging, with a yield increase rate of 27%. The role of leaf cutting is mainly to inhibit growth, reduce the burden, increase light transmission, and make the stems grow healthy and strong. However, leaf cutting must be carried out relatively early (preferably during greening and jointing). High-density experimental fields with the risk of etiolation and lodging should be cut earlier, and can be cut again if necessary. If the leaf cutting is too late, it will affect the assimilation (the process by which nutrients are absorbed and transformed into substances that make up cells and various living tissues, also known as constructive metabolism) of the plant and the normal transport of assimilation products (such as starch and carbohydrates), thus causing a reduction in production, and attention should be paid to this. For example, in 1958, we conducted a leaf cutting comparison at a base point in Meng County, Henan, during the booting stage, and the result was a yield reduction of 47%, because at that time, the flag leaves (the uppermost leaf of wheat. The wheat is about to head when the flag leaf appears) and the first leaf under the flag leaf were cut off. No matter whether it is thinning or leaf cutting, the plants will be injured, and some quick-acting fertilizer should be applied immediately after treatment and watered to promote recovery.
For seedlings with a density of less than one million plants, if there is etiolation, rolling (such as rolling the seedlings with a stone roller in the field, the seedlings will be injured, but will not die) or leaf cutting can be used to inhibit it. For example, the East China Academy of Agricultural Sciences recently conducted a survey in Baimao Township, Changshu, Jiangsu. The plant height of the wheat field after rolling was lower, and the tillering rate was 74.5%, while the plant height of those that had not been rolled was obviously higher, and the tillering rate was 58.5%. Rolling can inhibit the upward elongation of wheat seedlings, promote the increase of tillers, and make the stems thick, strong, and tidy, but rolling is not suitable for wheat fields with a seedling density of one million plants or excessively tall seedlings, because after rolling, the leaves of the wheat plants completely cover the ground, causing the lower leaves to turn yellow and the wheat seedlings to grow weaker.

    (2) Large-area high-yield fields should prevent lodging as early as possible

For large-area high-yield fields, the general seedling density is within one million plants, and the phenomenon of over-densification has not occurred. However, precisely because high-yield fields mostly have better fertilizer and water conditions, there is still the possibility of etiolation and lodging, especially in wheat fields sown earlier, so it is necessary to pay attention to controlling etiolation and preventing lodging as early as possible. It is necessary to master the early spring fertilization and watering work very well. From the perspective of plant growth and development, it is necessary to supply nutrients and water in a timely manner during the greening and jointing period to increase the effective tillering rate and promote the formation of large ears and many grains. However, during this period, the temperature rises and the plants grow rapidly. If too much quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer is applied and too much water is poured, it is easy to cause excessive elongation of the internodes at the base of the stems and excessive luxuriant branches and leaves, resulting in etiolation and lodging. Therefore, without affecting the normal growth of wheat seedlings, the timing and quantity of early spring topdressing and watering should be appropriately controlled. Measures such as applying nitrogen fertilizer in stages and in appropriate amounts according to the growth of the seedlings, applying phosphorus and potassium fertilizer in early spring, and appropriately delaying the jointing watering are all necessary. The rolling and leaf cutting methods mentioned in the previous section can also be applied.

Early spring fertilization and irrigation of high-yield experimental fields is even more crucial. The above principles require stricter implementation, especially the amount of topdressing should be controlled. Taking nitrogen fertilizer as an example, such as ammonium sulfate, it is best not to exceed 40 catties for one topdressing. After heading and flowering, ground fertilization should be stopped. In terms of irrigation, if the soil is very moist in early spring, it is not necessary to mechanically implement the original irrigation system. It is necessary to flexibly apply the "three look" watering technology of looking at the sky, looking at the land, and looking at the crops.

    (3) General fields should pay attention to improving the effective tillering rate

Last year, due to the adoption of the 1958 high-yield experience and the implementation of the Eight-Character Charter, the general seedling density of wheat in the fields was about 400,000 to 600,000 plants, and they generally grew strongly, basically achieving full and strong seedlings, laying a good foundation for this year's harvest. However, full and strong seedlings are only the first step to obtaining a high yield, and it is also necessary to strengthen management through the three passes of plant, ear, and grain. Although the amount of fertilizer applied to winter wheat this year is more than in previous years, the general quality is not good enough, and because the sowing density has increased and the cultivated layer has deepened, the amount of fertilizer in the entire soil layer is not very large. Therefore, it is necessary to seize the early spring to carry out measures such as top-dressing harrowing wheat (i.e., harrowing wheat when the ground is not thawed), rolling, and top-dressing watering during the greening and jointing period to increase the effective tillering rate and promote the development of ears and grains. In the suburbs of Beijing and the Henan region, it is still possible to observe the phenomenon of yellowing of wheat seedlings in a few large fields. The results of on-site rapid measurement show that the yellowing wheat fields are mostly caused by insufficient fertility, except for cases where the groundwater level is too high, the soil is too wet, or the soil contains too much salt. For example, samples were taken from four large fields in Tongzhou, Fengtai, and other places for measurement. The content of nitrate nitrogen (a type of nitrogen fertilizer, nitrate radical) in the topsoil of the yellow seedling area of the same wheat field was less than level one, and the available phosphorus was level 1.8, while the nitrate nitrogen in the soil of the adjacent green seedling area was level one, and the available phosphorus was level 3.3. It can be seen that the most important thing for general fields at present is still how to keep up with fertilization and irrigation. In terms of irrigation, attention should also be paid to leveling the ditches, improving irrigation technology, and achieving timely and appropriate light and uniform watering. Of course, no matter which type of wheat field, it is necessary to strengthen management and protection work at any time and place, and completely overcome various natural disasters to ensure high yield and bumper harvest.

    从苗期生育看冬小麦的合理密植
    中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所
    1959年度的冬小麦生产，从一开始就有了很大的跃进。以北方冬麦区而论，一般深耕一尺上下，施基肥一万多斤，每亩播种量为三十斤以上，比以往增加约一倍。以密植为中心、深耕为基础、水肥为前提的冬小麦丰产栽培技术有了进一步的发展。各地高产试验田的播种量从每亩六、七十斤以至千斤，所采取的栽培措施也是多种多样的。在这样悬殊的播种密度下，冬小麦的生育会起些什么变化？超过多大密度就不适宜？过密之后又将怎么办？都是当前生产上和科学研究上亟待解决的问题。这对于进一步指导冬、春小麦大面积丰产和高额丰产，保证今年更大丰收有很大意义。
            小麦密植的合理限度
    密植能够增产，但并不是说越密越好。在一定的范围内增加播种密度时，由于单位面积内总株数增加，能够更充分而有效地利用阳光空气和其他营养条件，适当控制分蘖的数量，巩固早期分蘖，减少无效分蘖，并增加主穗率，从而达到穗多穗大，增加产量。超过一定的范围，由于严重地影响到单株的正常生长，不但不能增产，还会招致减产。根据我们在各地取样调查一百八十三块丰产田的资料统计结果，随着播种密度的增加，单株分蘖数，单株叶片数，单株地上部干物重（地上部分的苗烤干去掉水分以后的重量），叶片和叶鞘（叶子下面呈圆柱状的部分）基部含醣量，单位叶面积的干物重，单株初生根（种子吸收水分以后萌发的根，又称种子根）数，次生根（植物吸收土壤中的养分而长出的根，又称永久根）数，有次生根植株所占的比率，根的粗细，单株根系干物重等，都相应地递减。另一方面，未分蘖的植株所占的比率，弱苗率（指生长十分纤弱、难以继续生存的植株），株高，“挺”（外表似茎，实际是茎部叶片的叶鞘延长后组成的，群众称为“挺”）长，主茎第二叶片以上各叶的长／宽比率等，则随密度的增加而递增。播种密度在每亩一百—一百五十万株时，有三分之一以上的植株不分蘖，开始出现（占1.5％）难以继续生存的弱苗。从单株地上部干物重看，播种密度在五十—一百五十万株之间没有什么差别，密度增至一百五十万株以上时则显著递减。主茎第二、三叶叶片形状也有类似情况，超过一百五十万株时叶片狭长，淡薄多水，干物重显著降低。本院播种量对比试验在播种密度为一百万株时叶片含醣量为14.8％，一百五十万株时为12.9％，二百万株时为13％。播种密度在一百五十万株以上时单株初生根和次生根的数目减少，着生次生根植株所占百分率明显地降低。根据以上这些观察看来，每亩一百五十万株（折合每亩下种约一百斤）的密度可能是一个转折点，许多标志着苗期生育状态的特征特性在播种密度超出一百五十万株以上时就有了明显的变化。调查材料还指出，每亩总分蘖数，植株地上部总干物重，叶片总面积和根系总重量是随着播种密度的增大而增加的。以每亩总分蘖数而论，播种密度在二百万株以内时增长很快，二百五十—五百万株之间则稍平缓，往上又形增加。再就单株分蘖数（不包括主蘖）看在一百五十万株以内时单株分蘖都在一个以上，随密度的增加而递减较快，往上则分蘖很少，以至于不分蘖。当然，根据目前苗期阶段生育情况来对冬小麦的合理密度下个结论，为时还早。因为这仅仅反映麦苗在冬前的生长情况（而冬前生育情况又受播种期的影响很大），早春返青、拔节前后植株的生育必然又有所变化，而且随着条件的改变，最合理的播种密度也会有所不同。但是可以肯定地说，苗期已不能适应的播种密度，返青、拔节后问题将会更多，生长必定不好。
    过密之后为什么生长不好呢？主要是光照营养不良。根据北京农业大学观测结果，播种密度三百五十万株、苗高尺许的高产试验田，在植株离地面三分之一高度处的光照强度为二百三十米烛光（衡量光照强度的标准，即一米距离一支烛光），离地面三分之二高度处光照强度为二千米烛光，而一般苗高十五厘米的大田，距地面三分之一高度处为一万三千米烛光，三分之二处为二万四千米烛光，二者相差十倍到几十倍。按照苏联植物生理学家马克西莫夫的资料，小麦达到开花和结实的最低限度的光照强度为一千八百—二千二百米烛光，可见高产试验田的早期过于密集郁闭是很不利的。播种密度增加到一定程度后单位土地面积上叶面积过大，中层和下层叶片的光照条件很不好，被严重遮荫的叶片几乎不再是植物体有机物质的合成器官，而转变为有机物质的消耗者。因而在很大的程度上引起了光合作用强度的削弱，新陈代谢方向的改变，不能有效地积累营养物质。从不同密度条件下，叶片色泽、厚度、单位面积干物重和含醣量的变化，充分地反映了这一事实。正由于植株是处在醣分的饥饿状态，所以显著地抑制了根系的形成，而根系发育又转过来影响到分蘖的生长。由于过密，地上部互相拥挤，幼苗茎叶本着向光性的特点，总是向上生长争取光线，因而细胞伸长，叶绿素减少，幼苗现出纤维软弱的徒长现象。在播种密度与光照营养的关系上我们还观察到一个现象，就是在同样的密度条件下，早播的比晚播的分蘖少，次生根着生晚。例如，在丰台小屯调查北京市计委会的干部试验田，9月23日播种的反较9月13日播种者分蘖多，黄叶少；并且9月13日播种者，在密度为一百三十九万株时则有5.7％弱苗和9.8％带有死蘖的植株，而9月23日播种者则无弱苗和死蘖现象。在本院的和中国科学院生物学部的高产试验田上也观察到了这种现象。这可能是由于高产试验田在早播和其他综合栽培条件的共同影响下，由于气温较高，生长迅速，幼苗很早就开始遮荫，而且程度严重，以至于延迟或阻滞了分蘖和次生根的形成。若在适当晚播的情况下，由于气温较低，生育缓慢，荫蔽情况较轻，相对的说，反而有利于分蘖和生根。应该补充指出，由于各地高产试验田播种期早晚不一，播种密度的适合程度反映在冬前麦苗生育情况上就有所不同，因而也或多或少地增加了从苗期看合理密植的复杂性。至于在较高的密植情况下昼夜温差小些，夜间温度稍高，相对湿度也大，呼吸作用稍强，对于有机物质的积累确是不利的，但这不是矛盾的主要方面。关键问题还在于白天的光照条件。在密植情况下，任何改善植株的光照营养条件的措施都是有利的。此外，不同地区由于温度、水分、光照、地力和耕作栽培条件等的差异，其所适应的合理密度也应该有所不同。譬如南方冬麦区的合理播种密度就要比北方小些。
              加强密植麦田管理
    针对冬小麦高产试验田、大面积丰产田和一般大田三种不同情况，提出以下几点意见：
          （一）高产试验田要掌握合理的密度
    今年各地高产试验田由于播种量大、施肥量多，或多或少在冬前已有一些徒长现象。即使还没有徒长，也必须适当控制密度，加强田间管理，避免春季徒长倒伏。根据我们的调查结果，初步认为，除属于试验研究性质的不同播种量对比试验田外，一般高产试验田的密度以不超过一百五十万株为宜。过分稠密的麦田，例如每亩二百万苗以上的，最好及早进行疏苗工作，以利植株健壮生长。疏苗办法采用手剔、锄耪、耙耙均可，拔掉弱苗，留下壮苗，并酌留行间空隙，以利透光。目前北部冬麦区土壤还在冻结状态，不利于间苗，宜在早春恢复生长时进行。疏苗是不得已的办法，疏比不疏要好些，其效果要看以后生长情况决定。苗已表现徒长现象的还需要配合割叶，让它重新生长。幼苗密度在一百至一百五十万株的，如有徒长现象，可以割叶为主抑制生长，必要时也可以间苗。根据我们1958年11月22日在河北徐水大寺各庄调查，发生徒长的高产试验田，采用割叶方法有一定抑制效果。割后单株分蘖数和叶片数都有增加趋势，“挺”长变短，麦苗生长比较健壮些。1958年春季我们在河南孟县基点调查，在早期发生倒伏倾向的麦田上进行割叶，有减轻倒伏的效果，增产率为27％。割叶的作用主要是抑制生长，减轻负担，增加透光量，使茎秆生育健壮有力。但是割叶必须在比较早期（最好在返青拔节时）进行。有徒长倒伏危险的高度密植的试验田更应该早割，必要时可以再割。如果割叶太晚，会影响到植株的同化作用（养分经过吸收转变为组成细胞及各种活体组织的物质称同化作用，又称组成代谢）和同化产物（如淀粉、醣类）的正常运转，因而造成减产，应加注意。如1958年我们在河南孟县基点于孕穗期进行割叶对比，结果减产达47％，因为那时割去的都是旗叶（麦子最上面的一片叶子。旗叶一出现麦子就要抽穗）和旗叶下的第一叶片。不论间苗或割叶都要伤及植株，应该在处理之后即时适当追施一些速效性肥料并予浇水，以促使恢复生长。
  苗密度在一百万株以内的，如有徒长，可采用镇压（如用压场的石滚压苗，苗会受伤，但不会死）或割叶加以抑制。如华东农业科学研究所最近在江苏常熟白茆乡调查，经过镇压的麦田株高变低，分蘖率为74.5％，而未经过镇压者，株高显然较高，分蘖率为58.5％。镇压可抑制麦苗向上伸长，促使分蘖增加，茎秆粗壮齐整，但是苗密度在一百万株或幼苗生长过高的麦田，不宜镇压，因为镇压后麦株叶片盖严地面，反而引起下部叶片变黄，麦苗生长更为纤弱。
    （二）大面积丰产田要及早防止倒伏
    大面积丰产田，一般麦苗密度在一百万株以内的，并未发生过密现象。但是正因为丰产田大都是肥和水的条件较好的田地，仍有徒长倒伏的可能，特别是播种较早的麦田，所以首先必须及早注意控制徒长、防止倒伏。必须很好地掌握早春的施肥浇水工作。从植株的生长发育来说，返青拔节期间需要及时供给养分和水分，以提高有效分蘖率，促使形成大穗多粒。但是这一时期温度上升、植株生长迅速，如果施用速效性氮肥太多，浇水过大，则很容易引起茎秆基部节间过度伸长，枝叶过于繁茂，造成徒长倒伏。因此，在不影响麦苗正常生长的前提下，对于早春追肥浇水在时期和数量上应该适当控制，如看苗分期适量追施氮肥，早春追施磷钾肥，适当晚浇拔节水等措施都是必要的。上节所述的镇压和割叶办法也一样可以应用。
  高产试验田的早春施肥灌水更是一个关键。上述原则，要求执行得更严格些，特别是追肥量要加以控制。以氮肥为例，如硫酸铵，一次追肥最好不要超过四十斤，抽穗开花以后，地面施肥即应停止。在灌水方面，如果早春土壤十分湿润，则不必机械执行原定的灌溉制度，要灵活应用看天、看地、看庄稼的“三看”浇水技术。
          （三）一般大田要注意提高有效分蘖率
    去年大田种麦，由于采纳了1958年的丰产经验，贯彻了八字宪法，一般苗密度约在四十至六十万株之间，而且普遍生长健壮，基本上做到了苗全苗壮，为今年的丰收打下良好的基础。但是苗全苗壮只是获得丰产的第一步，还需要通过株、穗、粒三道关口，加强管理。今年度冬小麦施肥量虽然比往年增多，但是一般质量还不够好，并且由于播种密度增大，耕层加深，整个土层的肥料量并不很多，因此必须抓紧在早春进行顶凌耙麦（即在地未开冻时进行耙麦）、镇压和返青拔节期的追肥浇水等措施，以增加有效分蘖率，促进穗、粒发育。在北京郊区和河南地区仍然可以观察到少数大田麦苗变黄的现象，经现场速测的结果，一般发黄的麦田，除因地下水位过高，土壤过于潮湿，或者由于土壤含盐分较高等情况外，多半是肥力不足所致。如在通州、丰台等地四处大田取样测定，同块麦田黄苗处表土硝酸态氮（氮肥的一种，硝酸根式的）含量不到一级，有效磷为一点八级、而相邻的绿苗处土壤的硝酸态氮为一级，有效磷为三点三级。可见对一般大田来说，当前最重要的还是施肥、灌水如何跟上的问题，在灌水方面还应该注意平整沟渠，提高灌溉技术，做到适时适量、轻浇、匀浇。当然，不管是哪一类麦田都需要随时随地加强管理和保护工作，彻底战胜各种自然灾害，以确保丰产丰收。
