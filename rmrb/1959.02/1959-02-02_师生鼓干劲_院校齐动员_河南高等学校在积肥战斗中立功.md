According to the Henan Daily, the broad masses of teachers and students in Henan Province's higher education institutions, responding to the Provincial Party Committee's call to "quickly launch a manure collection campaign to ensure a bumper wheat harvest," enthusiastically participated in the manure collection movement.

All personnel at Zhengzhou University were in high spirits and full of energy. Students put up big-character posters and issued challenges overnight to express their determination. Students in Class 4 of the Physics Department collected five to six thousand catties of manure in just one morning. The university party committee held an enlarged meeting to discuss and study in detail the specific measures for participating in the manure collection and winter irrigation efforts, and issued a call to all personnel, requiring the collection of 4.5 million catties of manure within two months.

Students at Henan Medical College put forward a resounding battle slogan: "Fear no hardship, fear no cold, climb mountains, go to the fields, collect manure, irrigate wheat fields, do labor, propaganda, and healthcare all together," determined to be good commune members. Each class launched challenges and responses to each other. Most students made concrete plans to participate in manure collection, wheat irrigation, and medical care during the winter vacation. On the evening that the Provincial Party Committee issued its call, 120 fifth-year students, carrying shovels and baskets, braving the moonlight and cold wind, collected fertilizer sources everywhere on campus for an intense hour and a half, collecting over 30,000 catties of manure. Four third-year students dug a manure collection pit with an area of approximately twelve square meters in less than an hour.

The Henan Agricultural College Party Committee has convened meetings of all general branch secretaries and all faculty and staff for mobilization, requiring everyone to take action, everyone to collect manure, complete tasks with both quantity and quality, and emphasized that ideological work should be done well in the manure collection movement. Immediately afterward, competitions were launched between classes and groups throughout the school. One class in the Sixth Grade of the Forestry Department collected more than 210,000 catties of manure in one instance. The Party Committee Secretary and department heads all joined everyone in the battle.

More than 1,000 teachers and students at Luoyang Normal College also joined the manure collection movement. They decided to collect 2,000 catties of manure per person, in addition to completing their studies on time. In just three days, the entire college had collected more than 2.5 million catties of manure and sent 620,000 catties of manure to the fields.
