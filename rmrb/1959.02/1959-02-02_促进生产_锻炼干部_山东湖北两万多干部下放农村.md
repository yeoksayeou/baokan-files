Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 1st: According to the characteristics of the integration of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs in the people's communes, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee recently transferred more than 24,600 cadres from industrial, agricultural, commercial, educational, and military departments at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels to the people's communes for a short period of time. On the one hand, they help with the rectification of the communes, and on the other hand, they participate in labor training. At present, some of these cadres have gone to the countryside, and some are concentrating on studying the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the pilot experiences of commune rectification in various places, and democratically formulating plans for going to the countryside and labor discipline, taking regions as units. They will arrive in the countryside before the Spring Festival to celebrate the Spring Festival with the masses, and quickly devote themselves to the spring production campaign centered on accumulating fertilizer.

A large part of the cadres participating in this down-to-the-countryside movement are leading personnel. Among the 1,485 cadres transferred from the provincial-level directly affiliated organs, there are 31 ministers of the Provincial Party Committee and directors of departments and bureaus of the Provincial People's Committee, 135 division chiefs, and 335 section-level cadres. Party committees at the city and county levels have transferred a total of 21,629 cadres, including 69 prefectural-level cadres and more than 1,700 county-level cadres. Many cadres from scientific, medical, and news departments have also participated.

Before going to the countryside, the cadres from the provincial-level directly affiliated organs listened to the report by Zhang Xincun, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee, on the spirit of the National Rural Work Ministers' Conference. Pei Mengfei, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, addressed the cadres going to the countryside. The Provincial Party Committee requires cadres going to the countryside to appear as ordinary laborers, eat, live, and work with the masses, participate in labor production while helping with the rectification of the communes, and specifically complete four major tasks: (1) Publicize the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and through summarizing the achievements and experiences of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, greatly enhance the communist consciousness of the broad masses. (2) Rapidly help the people's communes launch a spring production upsurge centered on accumulating fertilizer. (3) Do a good job in rectifying and consolidating the communes. (4) Rectify and train their own ideological style, learn practical production knowledge, and cultivate typical examples and create experiences.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 1st: In order to promote a larger and more comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production than last year and continue to train cadres, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee has taken concrete measures to arrange for the labor participation of cadres from provincial-level directly affiliated organs this year. At present, the first batch of 1,500 cadres participating in labor are preparing their luggage and will soon depart to participate in labor production centered on accumulating fertilizer in various people's communes.

All cadres of Hubei provincial-level directly affiliated organs (except the old, weak, disabled, and sick) will be trained in three forms this year. The first is to participate in physical labor in batches and rotations, mainly agricultural production labor, with each person participating in labor for no less than one month this year. The second is that the Provincial Party Committee will select more than 300 cadres at the section level and above to go to grassroots units to serve as leading cadres of people's communes or production brigades, and conduct grassroots work training for six months to one year. The third is to select a group of experienced directors and deputy directors of departments and bureaus, and responsible cadres of various departments and commissions of the Provincial Party Committee to participate in grassroots work in rural areas, and according to the development of the communes, investigate and study how their respective professional work can adapt to the needs of commune development.

On the 29th, Zhao Xinchu, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, reiterated the great political significance of cadres going down to the countryside at a mobilization meeting for cadres going down to the countryside. He pointed out that the dispatching of cadres to lower levels in 1958 had yielded tremendous gains, encouraged the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses, and cadres’ ideological style had made tremendous progress. The situation of a high tide of a great leap forward in production this year has arrived, and cadres should participate in certain physical labor like ordinary laborers in order to further encourage the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of people.

    促进生产　锻炼干部
    山东湖北两万多干部下放农村
    新华社济南1日电　中共山东省委根据人民公社工农商学兵相结合的特点，最近从省、专区、县各级工农商学兵部门中抽调了干部两万四千六百多人，短期下放到人民公社，一面帮助整社工作，一面参加劳动锻炼。现在这批干部部分已经下乡，部分正在以地区为单位，集中学习党的八届六中全会决议和各地整社试点经验，民主制定下乡规划和劳动纪律。他们在春节前将到达农村，同群众一起欢度春节，并且迅速投入以积肥为中心的春季生产运动。
    参加这批下乡的干部中，很大一部分是领导骨干。省直属机关抽调的一千四百八十五名干部中，有省委部长、省人民委员会厅局长三十一人，处长一百三十五人，科级干部三百三十五人。各地市县委共抽调了二万一千六百二十九名干部，其中地委级干部六十九人，县级干部一千七百多人。科学、医务、新闻等部门也有很多干部参加。
    省直属机关下乡干部，在下乡以前，听了省委农村工作部部长张新村关于全国农村工作部长会议精神的传达报告。省委书记处书记裴孟飞对下乡干部讲了话。省委要求下乡干部要以普通劳动者的姿态出现，和群众同吃同住同劳动，一面参加劳动生产，一面帮助整社工作，具体完成四大任务：（1）宣传党的八届六中全会决议，通过对1958年工农业生产大跃进成就和经验的总结，把广大群众的共产主义觉悟大大提高一步。（2）迅速帮助人民公社掀起以积肥为中心的春季生产高潮。（3）做好整顿巩固公社的工作。（4）整顿锻炼自己的思想作风，学习实际的生产知识，并且要培养典型，创造经验。
    新华社武汉1日电　为了促进比去年更大更全面的工农业生产跃进高潮和继续锻炼干部，中共湖北省委采取具体措施，对今年省级直属机关干部下放劳动作了安排。目前，第一批参加劳动的一千五百名干部都在整理行装，不日即将出发，分赴各人民公社参加以积肥为中心的劳动生产。
    湖北省直属机关的全体干部（老弱残病者例外），今年将分三种形式进行锻炼。第一种是分批轮流参加体力劳动，主要是参加农业生产劳动，每人今年内参加劳动的时间都不少于一个月。第二种，省委抽出三百多名科级以上干部下到基层单位去，担任人民公社或生产大队的领导干部，进行半年到一年的基层工作锻炼。第三种，抽调一批有经验的厅局长、省委各部、委负责干部到农村参加基层工作，并根据公社发展情况，调查研究各自业务工作如何适应公社发展的需要。
    29日，中共湖北省委书记处书记赵辛初在干部下放动员大会上，重申了干部下放的重大政治意义。他指出，1958年干部下放取得了巨大的收获，鼓舞了广大群众的革命干劲，密切了干部和群众的关系，干部思想作风有了巨大的进步。今年生产大跃进高涨的形势已经来到，干部要像一个普通劳动者一样，参加一定的体力劳动，以进一步鼓舞广大人民的革命干劲。
