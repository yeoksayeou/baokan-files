Gansu People Advance Victoriously
Gansu People are Highly Motivated: Glorious Construction Achievements Last Year; Strive for a Greater and More Comprehensive Leap Forward This Year

    (Our report) News: The people of Gansu Province, with full revolutionary vigor, overcame all difficulties and advanced with great strides, winning an all-round leap forward in various tasks in 1958, and began to embark on the road to prosperity and beauty in this previously poor and backward region.
    In 1958, the achievements in various tasks in Gansu were glorious. Agricultural production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with grain output more than doubling, averaging over 1,200 catties of grain per person. Steel production went from zero to over 300,000 tons of iron and over 50,000 tons of steel; transportation and coal production leaped forward rapidly, and the machinery industry also underwent a great transformation. More than 6,000 new industrial products were added, presenting a prosperity never seen in history. The province's basic construction was done very well, completing 99% of the leap forward plan, and the scale of the large industrial bases in Lanzhou and the Hexi Corridor has taken shape. The province's fiscal revenue also almost doubled. Great achievements have also been made in culture, education, and science.
    This is the result of the people of Gansu, under the leadership of the Party, carrying forward the spirit of continuous revolution. According to the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has initially summarized the basic experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958: First, to revolutionize nature, we must first revolutionize our thinking, and we must implement putting politics in command in all our work, and let communist ideology guide the progress of various tasks. In 1958, Party committees at all levels launched fierce struggles against the "Gansu backwardness theory" and the "settling accounts after the autumn harvest faction," learned from the lessons of the saddle shape, and criticized all kinds of right-leaning conservative thinking. The whole Party broke with the theory of "less, slow, poor, and costly," and established the theory of "more, faster, better, and more economical;" broke with the theory of "heavenly opportunity first," and established the theory of "man will conquer nature;" broke with the theory of "science and technology are out of reach," and established the theory of "everyone can master science and technology;" broke with the theory of "production increase has reached its limit," and established the theory of "unlimited potential;" broke with metaphysics and idealism, and established dialectics and materialism. In this way, people's revolutionary thinking was liberated, and the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act was established. Second, all work must involve large-scale mass movements, using movements to mobilize the masses, organize the masses, and educate the masses, so that all tasks present a vigorous and lively situation. In 1958, the province mobilized one million people on the steel front, more than 200,000 people on the Yintao project, and deep plowing, fertilizer accumulation, elimination of the four pests, and running schools were all vigorous mass movements. Recently, the province has launched a mass movement to accumulate fertilizer, produce fertilizer, and build water conservancy projects. Large-scale mass movements have enabled all tasks to advance at high speed, and various achievements have in turn further encouraged all the people. Third, we must learn to walk on two legs, and grasp and apply dialectics in all practical work. In 1958, under the constant guidance of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the whole Party implemented the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, light and heavy industry, central and local industry, large, medium, and small enterprises, and indigenous and foreign methods of production, on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, which promoted the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and made everything run more, faster, better, and more economically. Fourth, as long as we recognize the laws of development of objective things and give play to subjective initiative in practice, we can turn bad things into good things. In 1958, the Party led the people of the province to work diligently, overcome difficulties, and turn unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions, and achieved brilliant achievements on all fronts. In this year, the Party also, according to the laws of social development and the urgent demands of the broad masses of ethnic minorities, enabled ethnic minority areas to realize the people's commune system in a short period of time, and made great progress in all aspects of the work of ethnic minorities.
    1959 is a decisive year for fundamentally changing the economic face of Gansu through three years of hard work. In order to strive for a greater and more comprehensive leap forward this year than last year, millions of people in the province's 13 million population are vigorously engaged in winter fertilizer accumulation and sideline production; more than one million people are fighting on the front lines of water conservancy construction and winter irrigation; and hundreds of thousands of people are busily manufacturing small blast furnace equipment and building transportation roads. Inside and outside the Great Wall, east and west of the Yellow River, there are now crowds of people with soaring enthusiasm, actively striving to make Gansu more prosperous and beautiful in the new year.

### 甘肃人民干劲冲天　去年建设成就辉煌  力争今年更大更全面的跃进

    甘肃人民乘胜前进
    甘肃人民干劲冲天　去年建设成就辉煌
    力争今年更大更全面的跃进
    本报讯　甘肃省人民用饱满的革命干劲，排除万难大步前进，赢得了1958年各项工作全面的跃进，使这块原来又穷又白的地方，开始走上富美的道路。
    1958年甘肃各项工作的成绩都是辉煌的。农业生产获得空前未有的大丰收，粮食产量翻了一番以上，平均每人有粮一千二百余斤。钢铁从无到有，生产了三十多万吨铁、五万多吨钢；运输、煤炭跃进很快，机械工业也来了个大翻身。全部工业产品新增加六千多种，出现了历史上从未有过的繁荣。全省的基本建设搞得很好，完成了跃进计划的99％，兰州市、河西走廊大工业基地的规模已经形成。全省的财政收入也几乎增加了一倍。文教科学方面也取得了很大的成绩。
    这是甘肃人民在党的领导下发扬不断革命精神的结果。中共甘肃省委根据八届六中全会精神，初步总结了1958年大跃进的基本经验：第一，要革大自然的命，必先革思想的命，必须在一切工作中实行政治挂帅，让共产主义思想指导各项工作前进。1958年，各级党委同“甘肃落后论”、“秋后算账派”展开了激烈的斗争，吸取了马鞍形的教训，批判了形形色色的右倾保守思想。在全党破少慢差费论，立多快好省论，破天时第一论，立人定胜天论，破科学技术高不可攀论，立人人可以掌握科学技术论，破增产到顶论，立潜力无穷论，破形而上学和唯心论，立辩证法和唯物论。这样，解放了人们革命的思想，树立了敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格。第二，任何工作都要大搞群众运动，用运动的方式来发动群众，组织群众，教育群众，使各项工作都出现了轰轰烈烈的局面。1958年，全省在钢铁战线上动员了一百万人，引洮工程上动员了二十多万人，深翻地、积肥、除四害、办学校都是轰轰烈烈的群众运动。最近，全省又展开了积肥、造肥和兴修水利的群众运动。大搞群众运动，使得各项工作能够高速度前进，而各种成就又反过来进一步鼓舞着全体人民。第三，要学会用两条腿走路，在一切实际工作中掌握和运用辩证法。1958年，在党中央和毛主席的不断教导下，全党贯彻执行了在优先发展重工业的基础上实行工业和农业同时并举、轻重工业同时并举、中央工业和地方工业同时并举、大中小型企业同时并举、土法生产和洋法生产同时并举，推动了工农业生产大跃进，使一切事业都办得多快好省。第四，实践中只要认识客观事物的发展规律，发挥主观能动性，就能够变坏事为好事。1958年，党领导全省人民兢兢业业，克服困难，变不利条件为有利条件，在各个战线上都取得了辉煌的成就。这一年，党还根据社会发展规律和少数民族广大人民群众的迫切要求，使少数民族地区在短期内实现了人民公社化，使少数民族各方面工作得到很大发展。
    1959年，是苦战三年基本改变甘肃经济面貌的具有决定性的一年。全省人民为了争取今年比去年有更大更全面的跃进，在全省一千三百万人中，有数百万人在大搞冬季积肥和副业生产；有一百多万人战斗在兴修水利和冬灌线上；有数十万人在紧张制造小高炉设备和修筑运输道路。长城内外，黄河东西，现在到处是冲天干劲的人群，他们积极争取在新的一年里，把甘肃变得更加富裕和美好。
