Xinhua News Agency report: On the eve of the Spring Festival, in order to express the Party and the government's cordial concern for the people in the old revolutionary base areas, the Party and government leading organs of Pingjiang, Liuyang, Rucheng, Guidong, Huarong, Zixing, Lingxian, Chaling, Youxian, Sangzhi and other counties in Hunan Province organized visiting delegations to go deep into the townships and communes to visit the people in the old revolutionary base areas.

Through these visits, the visiting delegations from various counties commended the heroic and exemplary deeds of the people in the old base areas in socialist construction, introduced them to the splendid achievements of the Great Leap Forward in various parts of the country in 1958, and called on them to contribute even greater efforts to the even greater and better leap forward in 1959. The Youxian visiting delegation visited eleven people's communes, twenty-six production brigades, and thirty-three homes for the elderly, and held twenty-seven discussion meetings with the local people. During their visits, the visiting delegations from various counties provided appropriate assistance to individual commune members who were experiencing relatively difficult living conditions. Some commune members lacked clothing and bedding for the winter, and the visiting delegations helped to resolve this by providing government subsidies and mobilizing the masses to help each other. Sick commune members also received free treatment from the medical teams brought by the visiting delegations. The visiting delegations also brought film projection teams and troupes to perform various programs for the people in the old revolutionary base areas.

This meticulous care and consideration from the Party and the government deeply moved the people in the old revolutionary base areas, and their enthusiasm for production has been further enhanced. After the Rucheng County visiting delegation visited the old base area in Xibian Mountain, a surge of production was quickly set off. After the Youxian visiting delegation visited the Huangfengqiao People's Commune, the commune members of the Fengta Brigade braved the wind and rain to vigorously accumulate fertilizer, saying, "We would be letting down the Party and the government's concern if we don't do a good job in production."

    湖南平江等县党政机关组织
    访问团访问革命老根据地人民
    据新华社讯　春节前夕，为了表达党和政府对革命老根据地人民的亲切关怀，湖南省平江、浏阳、汝城、桂东、华容、资兴、酃县、茶陵、攸县、桑植等县的党政领导机关都先后组织访问团，深入乡、社访问了革命老根据地人民。
    各县访问团通过这次访问，表扬了老根据地人民在社会主义建设中的英雄模范事迹，向他们介绍了1958年祖国各地大跃进的辉煌成就，并号召他们在1959年更大更好的跃进中贡献出更大的力量。攸县访问团访问了十一个人民公社、二十六个生产大队和三十三个敬老院，和当地人民举行了二十七次座谈会。各县访问团在访问期间，对个别生活比较困难的社员都进行了适当的帮助。有的社员缺少过冬衣被，访问团就采取政府补助和发动群众互相帮助的办法帮助解决。生病的社员也得到了访问团带来的医疗队的免费治疗。各地访问团还带了电影放映队和剧团为老根据地人民演出各种节目。
    党和政府这种无微不至的关怀和照顾，使革命老根据地人民深受感动，他们生产的积极性更加高涨。汝城县西边山老根据地人民在访问团访问以后，很快就掀起了生产热潮。攸县访问团访问了黄丰桥人民公社以后，这个公社的风塔大队的社员们冒着风雨大搞积肥，他们说：“我们不搞好生产，就对不起党和政府的关怀。”
