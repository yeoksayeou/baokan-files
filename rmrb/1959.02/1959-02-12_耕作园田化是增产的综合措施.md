Field cultivation for gardening is a concentrated expression of the comprehensive implementation of the eight major measures for increasing production: "water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, protection, tools, and management." In 1958, Hebei Province widely promoted this comprehensive measure in agricultural production, with land fully meeting the standards of gardening accounting for about one-quarter of the total cultivated area. The results of the past year's implementation have proven that gardening plays a huge role in the development of agricultural production. The province's output of grain, cotton, and oil crops in 1958 all increased by about double compared to 1957, and high-yield records appeared in various regions and for various crops.

The promotion of field cultivation for gardening in Hebei Province was proposed under the new situation of great achievements in production centered on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation. The great development of water conservancy construction has added water conservancy facilities and water sources to tens of millions of mu of previously dry land throughout the province. The great development of the fertilizer accumulation movement has increased the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu from the previous two to three thousand jin to more than ten thousand jin. At the same time, many areas have carried out deep plowing of the land, increasing the depth from the past three or four cun to more than one chi, and many lands that had not been touched for many years have also been turned over. These changes in production conditions have raised many new issues for agricultural cultivation techniques: how to make full use of these water sources and strengthen irrigation management? In particular, how to irrigate many uneven dry lands without ridges or furrows? How to give full play to the yield-increasing role of water resources in land with existing irrigation and drainage projects? How to distribute and apply these fertilizers to maximize the yield-increasing effect? How to carry out leveling and cultivation after deep plowing of the soil? After changes in production conditions, how should other cultivation management measures adapt to them? The emergence of these new problems urgently requires a great leap forward and a great revolution in cultivation techniques. The realization of field cultivation for gardening is precisely a comprehensive measure to solve this series of new problems. Therefore, it further enriches the content of the production upsurge and enables the production upsurge to continue to develop wave after wave.

The Ten Standards of Gardening

In order to make the concept of field cultivation for gardening more concrete, Hebei Province conducted in-depth research and summarized the ten standards of gardening:

	1. Rely on people, not on heaven, double insurance against drought and flood. That is, do a good job in water conservancy, so that channels form a network, wells are arranged in rows, wells and channels are connected, ditches and channels are connected, able to irrigate and drain, ensuring harvest despite drought or flood.
	2. Plan cultivated areas, regionalize planting. That is, plant according to local conditions, planting various crops on the most suitable land.
	3. The land undergoes a major transformation, turning barren land into fertile fields. Generally, deep plow one chi or more, fertile fields deep plow two chi or more, hilly and mountainous areas promote contour ditching, low-lying areas renovate terrace fields, and poor soils must be improved.
	4. Level the land like a mirror, realizing ridge and furrow cultivation. In order to facilitate drainage and irrigation, and maintain water and fertilizer, it is necessary to make ridges and furrows, further liberating people's minds, and raising the low and padding the high, leveling the ground so that the ground is as flat as a mirror and the ridges are as straight as a line.
	5. Apply more base fertilizer and topdressing in stages to ensure that the crop's different growth stages meet the needs for fertilizer.
	6. Optimize crop varieties and carry out refined seed treatment.
	7. Rational close planting. Make full use of land fertility and space to maximize the number of plants, ears (bolls, fruits) per unit area; and adopt appropriate planting methods to ensure adequate ventilation and light transmission.
	8. Scientifically master irrigation and topdressing techniques, manage according to seedlings and plants, so that each plot is neat, each plant is strong, and weak and thin seedlings are eliminated.
	9. Achieve "double zero" (disease, insects), and strive for "triple zero" (disease, insects, weeds).
	10. Harvest carefully and thresh meticulously, returning every grain to the home.

These ten standards of gardening comprehensively and systematically integrate agricultural yield-increasing measures, thereby continuously promoting and developing the 1958 agricultural production upsurge at a higher level. On the basis of vigorously developing water, fertilizer, and soil, the province widely carried out a land leveling and ridge-making movement, and about more than ten million mu of autumn crops realized ridge and furrow cultivation. Improved varieties have been more widely promoted, and improved varieties of various crops evaluated by the masses have reached more than 80%. Density has increased significantly, especially the density of summer-sown crops has generally increased by one-half to one-third compared to previous years, and high-yield satellite fields have implemented highly dense planting. Vigorously carry out field management to prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests. Crops with water conservancy conditions throughout the province were generally watered one to three times, more than 80% of the crops were topdressed with fertilizer, and they were generally cultivated four or five times or more. More than half of the communes have basically achieved "four zeros." During the wheat planting period, the promotion of field cultivation for gardening entered a new upsurge. Wheat fields cultivated according to gardening standards from land preparation to sowing accounted for 60% of the total wheat field area in the province, creating favorable conditions for a greater wheat harvest in 1959.

To Carry Out Gardening, We Must Break Down Superstition

The promotion of field cultivation for gardening is the product of breaking down superstition and liberating thinking, and the result of promoting gardening has further greatly liberated people's thinking.

The promotion of gardening, characterized by a high degree of intensive cultivation, on a large area is a new stage in the development of agricultural production in our province and a revolutionary measure to change the backward and extensive cultivation techniques in vast areas. At the beginning of the promotion, it is natural to encounter resistance from some conservative ideas. For example, some believe that human and material conditions cannot be met; some believe that there is no foundation in the past and it must be done slowly; some feel that it can only be done on a small area and not on a large area; some are skeptical of the various standards required for gardening, afraid that close planting will reduce production, afraid that too much fertilizer will cause mad growth, worried that more management will be ineffective and a waste of labor, and so on. Therefore, vigorously promoting gardening must be fought against these various conservative ideas.

However, the vast number of cadres and the masses actively support field cultivation for gardening, which is the mainstream of the movement. Leaders at all levels have grasped the mainstream of the movement, widely adopted the methods of great airing, great release, and great debate, as well as the methods of "inviting in" and "sending out" to help areas with a poor foundation, using advanced ideas and successful experience to overcome conservative ideas, thereby making the promotion of gardening a mass movement.

The achievement of a bumper harvest in promoting gardening shows that it is entirely possible to realize gardening on a large area. Some areas have combined the promotion of gardening with large-area high-yield fields to create high-yield squares, high-yield roads, and high-yield depressions. Chengan County created one hundred cotton high-yield squares and twenty cotton high-yield roads, totaling 150,000 mu. The per mu yield of ginned cotton reached more than 300 jin, establishing a typical example of large-area high-yield cotton production, vividly proving that high yields can be achieved through intensive cultivation on a large area.

Due to the growth changes and yield increases caused by intensive cultivation, many new scientific conclusions have been established. For example, in the past it was believed that the maximum density of Baima Ya corn was about 2,500 plants, and more would result in empty stalks. However, in 1958, some densely planted to 7,000 to 8,000 plants per mu, and due to sufficient water and fertilizer and timely management, there were no empty stalks. In the past, it was believed that if cotton was planted on fertile land or too much fertilizer was applied, it would grow wildly, mature late, not bear peaches, and drop bolls. However, last year cotton achieved a bumper harvest under conditions of abundant water and fertilizer due to timely and meticulous management. These facts have changed people's past views of passively adapting to nature and controlling crop growth and development, and established the view of actively transforming nature and promoting crop growth and development.

Gardening is the Result of the Liberation of Productive Forces

Implementing intensive cultivation gardening undoubtedly requires more labor, fertilizer, and seedlings than general shallow and extensive cultivation methods. In the past, planting general food crops required about ten workdays per mu, and cotton required fifteen to twenty workdays. From the typical surveys of labor input in several high-yield satellite fields in 1958, wheat with a per mu yield of 1,300 jin required 23.75 workdays; millet with a per mu yield of 11,181.9 jin required 89.15 workdays; and cotton with a per mu yield of 2,232 jin of seed cotton required 166.1 workdays. These high-yield fields require several times more labor than general fields, while the yield is more than ten to dozens of times higher. Although intensive cultivation on a large area requires less labor input per mu than high-yield satellite fields, it always increases labor and capital investment by several times compared to general fields. Therefore, without the development of productive forces, it is impossible to promote gardening on a large area. Gardening was originally the creation of veteran farmers for many years, but in the past, due to the constraints of the small-scale peasant economy on productive forces, it could only be limited to small-area applications and could not be promoted on a large area.

The promotion of gardening on a fairly wide scale in 1958 was due to the fact that advanced cooperativization liberated the productive forces. The liberation of productive forces is manifested in two aspects: one aspect is the发挥 (fā huī) of labor potential, and the other aspect is the vigorous development of tool reform. In terms of发挥 (fā huī) labor potential, what stands out is: vigorously developing the "fourizations" and "two courtyards," liberating female labor from household labor and putting it into production; improving labor organization, organizing socialist large-scale collaboration, strengthening labor management, and implementing organizational militarization, combat actionization, collective lifeization, and democratic management, etc., which also greatly improved labor productivity. The tool reform movement in 1958 played a great role in improving labor productivity. According to incomplete statistics from the province, a total of 11.49 million newly created and reformed tools were created, which greatly promoted the promotion of field cultivation for gardening.

However, the promotion of gardening in 1958 was still preliminary. From the scope, it was not yet widespread, and from the standards, it had not reached a higher level. This is still a contradiction between intensive cultivation and insufficient labor. We believe that on the basis of realizing the people's communeization, better improving labor management, and using greater efforts to carry out tool reform, it will be possible to realize higher standards of gardening on a larger scale, so that the yield per unit area can be further increased.

According to the plans of various localities in Hebei Province, this spring, field cultivation for gardening will be promoted in a large area of more than 35 million mu of wheat fields and more than 19 million mu of spring-sown crops in high-yield fields. These areas are making various preparations for field cultivation for gardening.

    耕作园田化是增产的综合措施
    园田化是“水、肥、土、种、密、保、工、管”八大增产措施全面贯彻的集中表现。1958年，河北省在农业生产上较普遍地推行了这一综合措施，全部实现园田化各项标准的土地约占总耕地面积的四分之一左右。一年来推行的结果，证明园田化对于农业生产的发展起了巨大的作用。全省1958年粮食、棉花、油料的产量都比1957年增长了一倍左右，并且各个地区，各种作物都出现了高产纪录。
    河北省推行耕作园田化，是在以水利、积肥为中心的生产取得巨大成绩的新形势下提出来的。水利建设的大发展，使全省几千万亩原来的旱地增加了水利设备和水源；积肥运动的大发展，使全省每亩平均施肥数量由以往的两三千斤，骤增到一万多斤；同时不少地区大搞深翻土地，由过去耕深三、四寸增加到一尺以上，有许多多年不动的土地也翻了身。这些生产条件的改变，对农业耕作技术提出了许多新的问题：如何充分利用这些水源，加强灌溉管理？特别是许多旱地高低不平，无垅无畦如何进行灌溉？已有灌溉排水工程的土地如何充分发挥水利资源的增产作用？这些肥料如何分配施用才能发挥最大的增产效果？土壤深翻后如何进行平整耕作？在生产条件改变后，其他耕作管理措施如何与之相适应等等。这些新问题的提出，迫切要求在耕作技术上也来一个大跃进、大革命。而实现耕作园田化正是解决这一系列新问题的综合措施。因之，它更加丰富了生产高潮的内容，并使生产高潮一浪接一浪地持续发展下去。
  园田化的十项标准
    为了使耕作园田化这一概念更加具体化，河北省进行了深入的调查研究工作，并总结了园田化的十项标准：
    1、靠人不靠天，旱涝双保险。即搞好水利，作到渠成网、井成排、井渠相通、沟渠相连、能灌能排、旱涝保收。
    2、规划耕作区，种植区域化。即因地种植，把各种作物都种在最适宜的土地上。
    3、土地大翻身，瘠地变肥田。一般地深翻一尺以上，丰产田深翻二尺以上，丘陵山区推行等高撩壕，低洼地区整修台地畦田，不良土壤要进行改良。
    4、整地平如镜，实现畦田化。为了便于排灌，保持水肥，必须都作成畦田，进一步解放了人们的思想，并且起高垫低、平整地面，使地平如镜、埂直如线。
    5、多施底肥、分期追肥，保证满足作物不同生育阶段对肥分的需要。
    6、作物品种优种化，并且进行精细的种子处理。
    7、合理密植。充分利用土地地力和空间，最大限度地增加单位面积上的株数、穗数（铃数、果数）；并且采取适当的种植方式，保证充分的通风透光条件。
    8、科学地掌握浇水、追肥技术，按苗按棵进行管理，使块块整齐、株株健壮，消灭弱苗瘦苗。
    9、实现“双无”（病、虫），力争“三无”（病、虫、杂草）。
    10、精收细打，颗粒还家。
    这十项园田化的标准，把农业增产措施全面地系统地综合起来，从而把1958年的农业生产高潮以更高的规格持续地推动开展起来。全省在大搞水肥土的基础上，广泛开展了平地整畦运动，约有一千多万亩秋田作物实现了畦田化。良种得到更广泛的推广，各种作物经过群众评定的良种达到80％以上。密度均有显著增加，特别是夏播作物密度一般较往年增加二分之一到三分之一，高产卫星田实行了高度密植。大搞田间管理，防除病虫害。全省有水利条件的作物普遍浇一至三次水，80％以上的作物追了肥，普遍中耕四、五次以上。有半数以上的社基本上实现了“四无”。在种麦期间，推行耕作园田化又进入了一个新的高潮，从整地播种开始就按照园田化标准耕作的麦田占全省麦田总面积的60％，为1959年小麦更大丰收创造了良好的条件。搞园田化要破除迷信
    耕作园田化的推行是破除迷信、解放思想的产物，推行园田化的结果又进一步大大地解放了人们的思想。
    以高度的精耕细作为特点的园田化在大面积上推行，是我省农业生产发展的一个新阶段，是广大地区改变落后的粗放的耕作技术的一项革命措施。在推行之初，很自然地要遇到一些保守思想的阻力。如有的认为人力、物力条件达不到；有的认为过去没有基础，得慢慢来；有的觉得只能在小面积上搞；不能在大面积上搞；有的对园田化要求的各项标准抱怀疑，怕密植减产、怕多肥疯秧，顾虑多管理无效、白搭工等等。因之，大力推行园田化必须和这些各形各色的保守思想作斗争。
    但是广大干部和群众，积极地拥护耕作园田化，这是运动的主流。各级领导抓住了运动的主流，广泛地采取了大鸣、大放、大辩论的方法，以及用“请进来”“派出去”的方法帮助基础差的地区，用先进的思想和成功的经验克服了保守思想，从而使园田化的推行成为群众性的运动。
    推行园田化取得丰收的成就，说明在大面积实现园田化是完全可能的。有些地区把推行园田化和大面积丰产田结合起来搞成丰产方、丰产路、丰产洼等。成安县搞了一百个棉花丰产方，二十条棉花丰产路，共十五万亩。亩产皮棉达到三百多斤，树立起棉花大面积高额丰产典型，活生生地证明了在大面积上实现精耕细作是可以达到高产的。
    由于精耕细作所引起的作物生长变化和产量增加，树立了许多新的科学论断。比如过去认为白马牙玉米密植最多二千五百株左右，多了就空棵。而1958年有的密植到每亩七、八千株，由于水肥充足，管理及时，没有空棵。过去认为棉花种在肥地或施肥过多，就要长疯、晚熟、不结桃、落铃。但是去年棉花在多水多肥条件下，由于管理及时精细，同样获得大丰收。这些事实使人们改变了过去消极地适应自然，控制作物生长发育的观点，树立起积极地改造自然，促进作物生长发育的观点。
    园田化是生产力解放的结果
    实行精耕细作的园田化，无疑要比一般浅耕粗作的耕作方法多用人力、肥料和种苗。过去种一般粮食作物，每亩用工十个左右，棉花用工十五个到二十个。而从1958年若干高产卫星田的用工典型调查来看，小麦亩产一千三百斤的，用工二十三点七五个；谷子亩产一万一千一百八十一点九斤的，用工八十九点一五个；棉花亩产籽棉二千二百三十二斤的，用工一百六十六点一个。这些高产田比一般田用工都要多几倍，而产量则多收十几倍到几十倍。虽然在大面积上实行精耕细作比高产卫星田每亩用工量要少一些，但是比一般田总要成倍地增加工本投资。因此，没有生产力的发展，大面积地推行园田化是不可能的。园田化本是老农多年的创造，但过去由于小农经济对生产力的束缚，因而才只能限于在小面积上应用而不能在大面积上推广。
    1958年在相当广泛的范围内推行了园田化，就是由于高级合作化解放了生产力。生产力的解放表现在两个方面，一个方面是劳动潜力的发挥，一方面是大搞工具改革。在发挥劳动潜力方面，突出的是：大搞“四化”“两院”，把妇女劳力从家务劳动中解放出来投入生产；改善劳动组织，组织社会主义大协作，加强劳动管理，实行组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化和管理民主化等，也大大提高了劳动生产效率。1958年的工具改革运动对于提高劳动生产率起了很大的作用。全省不完全统计，创造和改制的各种工具共一千一百四十九万件，这些工具大大促进了耕作园田化的推行。
    但是1958年推行园田化还是初步的，从范围上看还不广泛，从标准上看也未达到较高的规格。这仍然是精耕细作和劳力不足的矛盾。我们相信，在实现人民公社化的基础上，更好地改善劳动管理，用更大的力量进行工具改革，必然能够在更大范围内实现更高标准的园田化，使单位面积产量得到更大的提高。
    按照河北省各地的计划，今年春天要在三千五百多万亩麦田，一千九百多万亩春播作物的大面积高产田里，推行耕作园田化。这些地区正在为耕作园田化进行种种准备工作。
