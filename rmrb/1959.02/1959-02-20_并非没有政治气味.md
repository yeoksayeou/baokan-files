Notes:

　　The Japanese "New Toho" film company has always been notorious for producing films that blatantly glorify militarism. Not long ago, this company produced the reactionary film "The Greater East Asia War and International Trials." This film openly propagates that the "Greater East Asia War" was the Japanese imperialists' "just war of self-defense," that the crimes of Tojo and other war criminals were "patriotic," and that "the defendants are not responsible for the brutal acts committed in China."

　　After the release of this militaristic film, it was spurned by the upright public opinion in Japan. However, several bourgeois newspapers in Japan, while yielding to public opinion and having to "criticize" the film for "affirming the war" and "turning back the wheel of history," also praised "its filming techniques that still have a certain appeal to the audience" and "it's very interesting." The "Yomiuri Shimbun" even said that the film "has no political overtones." This kind of propaganda is clearly not "devoid of political overtones."

    并非没有政治气味
    日本“新东宝”电影公司，一贯以拍摄露骨地赞扬军国主义的影片而臭名昭著。不久以前，这家公司又拍成了“大东亚战争和国际审判”的反动影片。这个影片竟公然宣扬“大东亚战争”是日本帝国主义的“正当的自卫战”，东条等战犯的罪行是“爱国”，“对于在中国进行的残暴行为，被告们是没有责任的”。
    这部军国主义影片上映后，遭到了日本正直舆论的唾弃。然而，日本的几家资产阶级报纸，一面慑于舆论，不得不“批评”这部影片“对战争加以肯定”“是倒转了历史车轮”，一面却又吹捧“它的拍摄技巧对观众还有一定的吸引力”，“很有趣”。“读卖新闻”甚至说这部影片“没有政治气味”。这种宣传显然并非“没有政治气味”的。
