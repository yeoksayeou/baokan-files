Build Xinjiang Richer and More Beautiful
The Production and Construction Corps are Full of Production Enthusiasm

(Reported by our newspaper) The Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps achieved great accomplishments in various production and construction endeavors including industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, basic construction projects, sideline occupations, and transportation in the past year. The total value of industrial and agricultural production reached 244.3 million yuan, equivalent to 4.8 times that of 1953.

The great leap forward in various production and construction undertakings of the production troops last year started with agriculture, animal husbandry, and land reclamation. Thanks to the mechanization of land reclamation by the production troops, the sown area was expanded from 2.21 million mu to more than 3.069 million mu. The area of reclaimed land exceeded the total area reclaimed during the entire First Five-Year Plan period. During the land reclamation, forty new mechanized military reclamation state farms were established. These new wastelands laid the foundation for the large-scale development of agriculture and animal husbandry by the production troops in the future.

In order to ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture, tens of thousands of agricultural production soldiers applied their years of accumulated experience in large-scale high-yield grain and cotton production to promote early maturity of grain and cotton. On the 3.069 million mu of land they sowed, they harvested a total of 438.4 million jin of grain, more than 274,000 dan of cotton, and nearly 5 million jin of oil crops (excluding cottonseed). The total output of grain and cotton increased by 78% and 26.6% respectively compared to the previous year. Less than one-third of the agricultural population of the entire army produced enough grain, meat, and vegetables to solve the staple food and non-staple food supply for the other two-thirds.

In the past, animal husbandry was a lagging link in the production troops. Last year, due to the correct implementation of the policy of simultaneously emphasizing large-scale and high-yield animal husbandry, and the simultaneous great leap forward in animal husbandry in agricultural areas and mountain pastures, the number of livestock increased by 26.6%, with a net increase of more than 190,000 heads, bringing the total number to more than 930,000 heads. The entire corps saw the emergence of two "10,000 sheep, 10,000 lambs" divisions, twenty-two "10,000 sheep, 10,000 lambs" farms and pastures, and one "1,000 cattle, 1,000 pigs" farm, among which the high-yield small herds of sheep and pigs achieved breeding rates of 202% and 9600% respectively, establishing a red banner for high-yield animal husbandry.

After the summer of last year, on the basis of the original development of processing sidelines, the production corps launched a high tide of large-scale industrial development on farms. In addition to expanding the original 115 small and medium-sized power plants, coal mines, tractor repair and parts, flour, rice milling, oil extraction, and cotton processing factories and mines, by the end of the year, more than 730 factories and mines were established. Among them, the larger ones include the Shihezi "August 1st" sugar refinery with an annual output of 25,000 tons of sugar, a textile factory with 50,000 spindles, and more than 70 others including coal and electricity. During the iron and steel campaign, the corps produced a total of 63,000 tons of pig iron and 2,093 tons of steel, and established 21 Western-style blast furnaces and 370 semi-Western-style and native blast furnaces. These iron-smelting blast furnaces can produce about 200,000 tons of pig iron annually.

At present, the industrial and processing sideline products of the corps have reached more than 300 varieties. In addition to being self-sufficient, these products are also supplied to nearby towns and rural areas. (Attached photo)

### 把新疆建设得更富更美  生产建设兵团生产干劲十足

    把新疆建设得更富更美
    生产建设兵团生产干劲十足
    本报讯　新疆军区生产建设兵团在去年一年中，工业、农业、畜牧业、基本建设事业、副业以及交通运输等各项生产建设事业取得很大的成就。工农业生产总值达到两亿四千三百多万元，相当于1953年的四点八倍。
    生产部队去年各项生产建设事业的大跃进，首先是从农牧业和开荒造田开始的。由于生产部队实现了开荒机械化把播种面积从二百二十一万亩扩大到三百零六万九千多亩。开荒面积超过了第一个五年计划期间开荒面积的总和，在开荒中，建立了四十个新的机械化的军垦国营农场。这些新的荒地，为今后生产部队大规模发展农牧业奠定了基础。
    为了保证农业大丰收，数万名农业生产战士运用了多年积累的粮棉大面积丰产的经验，促进粮棉早熟，在他们播种的三百零六万九千亩土地上，共收获了粮食四亿三千八百多万斤，棉花二十七万四千多担，油料作物近五百万斤（不包括棉籽），粮棉总产量分别比前年提高了78％和26.6％。全军不到三分之一的农业人口所生产出的粮食、肉类、蔬菜，便解决了其他三分之二以上的人的主食品和副食品的供应问题。
    畜牧业在过去是生产部队的落后环节，去年由于正确贯彻了畜牧业生产的大群丰产和小群高产同时并重，以及农业区和山区牧场养畜业同时大跃进的方针，牲畜头数增长了26.6％，净增牲畜十九万多头，总头数达到了九十三万多头。全兵团共出现了两个“万羊万羔”师，二十二个“万羊万羔”农场和牧场，一个“千牛千猪”农场。其中绵羊和生猪的小群高产单位，繁育率分别达到202％和9600％。树立起了畜牧业高产的红旗。
    去年夏季以后，生产兵团在原来发展加工副业的基础上掀起了农场大办工业的高潮，除了扩大原有一百一十五个中小型电厂、煤矿、拖拉机修配、面粉、碾米、榨油以及棉花加工等工厂、矿场外，到年底还办起了七百三十多个工厂矿场。其中规模较大的有年产糖两万五千吨的石河子、“八一”糖厂，五万纱锭的纺织厂，以及其他煤炭电力等共有七十多个。在钢铁大战中，兵团共炼出生铁六万三千吨、钢两千零九十三吨。建立起洋高炉二十一座、半洋半土高炉三百七十个。这些炼铁高炉年产生铁可达二十万吨左右。
    目前，兵团工业和加工副业产品已达三百多种，这些产品除自给外，还供应附近的城镇和农牧区。（附图片）
