　　Huangpi Implements the Eight-Character Constitution to Ensure Multiplied Increases in Rice, Cotton, and Oil Crops
　　Chenxi Launches Crash Program to Apply Topdressing Fertilizer to Achieve Simultaneous Leap Forward for Rapeseed and Wheat

　　(Our newspaper, Hankou, 18th dispatch) Huangpi County, Hubei Province, based on summarizing the achievements and experiences of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, has formulated a larger and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward plan for 1959. This leap forward plan is inspiring the people of the county to advance victoriously.

　　Agricultural production in Huangpi County in 1958 saw a flying leap development. Compared with 1957: Grain increased by more than double, cotton increased by more than seven times, and oil crops increased by 2.88 times.

　　In 1958, more than 15,000 cadres in the county, from the county party secretary to the production team leader, universally cultivated experimental plots. Due to the lead taken by the cadres, a mass movement of experimental plots surged throughout the county. A total of more than 230,000 mu of experimental plots were cultivated. In order to launch a mass movement of "learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced" throughout the county, the slogans "Grain to compete with Xiaogan, Cotton to catch up with Macheng, Peanuts to chase Hong'an" were put forward. In 1958, more than 3,000 cadres and masses in the county visited and studied in other places. The county, district, and township party secretaries not only visited Macheng, Hong'an, Xiaogan and other counties several times, but also sent representatives to Sichuan, Jiangsu, Heilongjiang and other provinces to learn advanced experience. Last June, after the responsible comrades of the county party committee saw the news of high rice yields in Wuxi County in the People's Daily, they sent a group to study. The experience of deep plowing of the land that they brought back greatly promoted deep plowing throughout the county.

　　The soaring enthusiasm of the masses is another major reason for the county's great achievements in 1958. In this year, stories of competitions between fathers and sons, competitions between husbands and wives, and competitions between commune members and secretaries could be found in every township.

　　After summarizing the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Huangpi County Party Committee formulated a larger and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward plan for 1959. This plan is: On the basis of 1958, the total grain output will increase by one time, striving for a rice yield of 4,000 jin per mu; the total output and yield per mu of cotton are required to increase by one time; oil crops will increase by 3.8 times, reaching 3.3 million dan. Other diversified economies will also have corresponding increases. In order to ensure the realization of this leap forward plan, in addition to continuing to promote last year's set of methods for carrying out mass movements in agriculture such as learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, large-scale evaluation, and large-scale competition, Huangpi County will take some new measures in implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture this year. Manure accumulation and fertilizer production are required to reach 1.3 billion dan, an increase of one time compared with last year. Six hundred million dan should be completed before the end of March, so that the base fertilizer for early and mid-season rice and cotton in the county can reach 1,000 dan per mu. The 7 million cubic meters of earth and stone for water conservancy projects are required to be completed by the end of February. After completion, 700,000 mu of paddy fields in the county will not be short of water even in the case of continuous drought for 100 days. The deep plowing of 220,000 mu of winter fallow land will also be completed before the end of February, and 140,000 mu of land with poor soil quality will be improved by adding sand and soil and applying more organic fertilizer. In terms of tool reform, the main focus is on consolidating and improving "Five-izations" (new-style walking plow-ization, cart-ization, rolling bearing-ization of transportation tools, rice harvesting machine-ization, threshing machine-ization). Currently, major efforts are being made to reform tools for plowing and planting. Vigorously develop the county and commune's agricultural implement industry, establish an agricultural implement repair and distribution network, produce 6,000 wooden rice transplanters before the end of April, and strive to eliminate hand transplanting.

　　Currently, the people of the county are launching a production competition upsurge centered on fertilizer accumulation. In addition to competing with the neighboring Xiaogan, Hong'an, and Xinzhou counties, each commune, management area, and production team within the county is also carrying out a heated competition. More than 500 competition battlefields have been opened up throughout the county, and 700,000 mu of summer harvest crops have generally been topdressed two to three times, and winter fertilizer has been applied. Mulang Commune accumulated more than 500,000 dan of fertilizer in just one day of fertilizer accumulation competition. The competition movement with fertilizer accumulation and preparation for planting as its content is pushing all production to a new upsurge. The people of the county accumulated more than 30 million dan of fertilizer, reformed and repaired more than 28,000 pieces of agricultural tools, and deeply plowed all the seedling fields once or twice, some of which had already been fertilized with base fertilizer in the five days before the Spring Festival. Some representatives sent to Xiaogan, Macheng, and Xinzhou to visit and study have already returned, and the county's first large-scale visit and evaluation this year is underway. (Luo Chongzhang)

　　(Our newspaper, Changsha, 18th dispatch) Chenxi County, Hunan Province, organized the masses to continue to increase their efforts and measures, to manage the fields of rapeseed and wheat like embroidery, and strive to achieve a wheat yield of 1,000 jin per mu and a rapeseed yield of more than 400 jin per mu.

　　The county has sown 54,070 mu of rapeseed and 52,874 mu of wheat this year, and they are generally growing well. However, when the county party committee proposed to add another effort to strive for a greater harvest of rapeseed and wheat, some people believed that the situation was already "set" and were unwilling to work any further. The county party committee carefully analyzed the current situation, believing that striving for high yields of wheat and rapeseed is an important part of realizing a greater leap forward in agricultural production in 1959. From the current point of view, there are many good conditions for striving for high yields of rapeseed and wheat. Spring has just arrived, and there is still more than a month before rapeseed flowers and wheat ripens, now is the growing season, and the situation is definitely not completely set. Therefore, the county party committee issued a call to "concentrate on doing a good job in the management of spring-harvest crops such as cultivation, topdressing, frost prevention, thinning, and replanting, without allowing any fields to be missed, and striving for a comprehensive high yield," and organized the masses to carry out debates. After recognizing the important significance of achieving a great harvest of spring-harvest crops, the cadres and masses throughout the county responded positively to the county party committee's battle call with practical actions. All seven communes in the county drew more than 50,000 laborers, formed more than 10,000 work teams, and after four days of intensive processing, all the more than 100,000 mu of rapeseed and wheat in the county were covered with a layer of pig and cattle manure, applying a total of 10 million dan of mixed fertilizer, an average of more than 90 dan per mu. The people of the county also managed the rapeseed and wheat with the spirit of "managing rapeseed and wheat like embroidery," processing them meticulously. The Yuanjiawan Brigade of Shengli Commune divided the more than 1,200 mu of rapeseed and wheat into sections according to living conditions, with each section assigned to a dedicated person to regularly check the growth situation, and determined 13 professional teams to specifically manage weeding, topdressing, pest control, frost prevention, and other work. Early in the morning, it was discovered in the inspection that 215 mu of rapeseed had green worms and grasshoppers, and the brigade immediately organized commune members to use suction tubes, brooms, sprayers, and other tools to carry out a three-day crash program to eliminate them.

　　After more than ten days of hard work and skillful work by the people of the county, every patch of rapeseed and wheat is lush green and neatly arranged, generally more than one chi and five cun deep, and all three types of seedlings have been eliminated. (Sun Xiaojian, Zhu Shaochao)

    黄陂贯彻八字宪法保证稻棉油料成倍增产
    辰溪突击追肥要油菜小麦一齐跃进
    本报汉口18日电　湖北省黄陂县在总结1958年大跃进成绩和经验的基础上，制订出1959年更大更全面的跃进规划。这个跃进规划正鼓舞着全县人民乘胜前进。
    黄陂县1958年的农业生产有了飞跃发展。和1957年比较：粮食增长一倍多，棉花增长七倍多，油料增长二点八八倍。
    1958年全县从县委书记到生产队长以上干部一万五千多人，普遍种了试验田。由于干部带头，群众性的试验田风起云涌。全县一共搞了二十三万多亩试验田。为了在全县掀起一个“学先进、赶先进”的群众运动，提出“粮食赛孝感，棉花赶麻城，花生追红安”的口号。在1958年内，全县有三千多干部和群众到外地参观学习。县、区、乡三级党委书记不仅几次去麻城、红安、孝感等县参观学习，还派了代表去四川、江苏、黑龙江等省学习先进经验。去年6月间，县委负责同志从人民日报上看到无锡县稻谷高产消息后，就派了一个小组前去学习。带回来深翻土地的经验，大大推动了全县的深耕。
    群众的冲天干劲，是这个县1958年取得巨大成绩的另一重大原因。这一年，父子比赛、夫妻比赛、社员和书记比赛的故事乡乡都有。
    黄陂县委在总结了1958年大跃进的经验后，制定出了1959年更大更全面的跃进规划。这个规划是：要在1958年基础上，粮食总产量增长一倍，力争亩产稻谷四千斤；棉花总产和单产都要求增长一倍；油料增长三点八倍，达到三百三十万担。其他多种经济均有相应增加。为了保证实现这个跃进规划，黄陂县除了继续推行去年的学先进、赶先进、大评比、大竞赛等一套农业上大搞群众运动方法外，今年要在贯彻农业“八字宪法”方面采取一些新的措施。积肥造肥要求达十三亿担，比去年增加一倍。3月底以前要完成六亿担，使全县早、中稻和棉花的底肥达到每亩一千担。七百万土、石方的水利工程，要求在2月底完工，完工后可使全县七十万亩水田，在连续百天干旱情况下不缺水。二十二万亩冬闲田也将在2月底前结束深翻，十四万亩土质瘠薄的土地，将采取掺沙掺土和多施有机肥料等办法改良土壤。工具改革方面主要是在巩固、提高“五化”（新式步犁化、车子化、运转工具滚珠轴承化、割禾器化、脱粒机化）基础上，当前大搞耕、种方面的工具改革。大力发展县和公社的农具工业，建立农具修配网，将在4月底以前生产六千部木制插秧器，争取消灭手插秧。
    当前，全县人民正开展一个以积肥为中心的生产竞赛高潮。除了与相邻的孝感、红安、新洲县开展竞赛外，县内各公社、管理区、生产队之间也开展热火朝天的竞赛。全县开辟了五百多处竞赛战场，七十万亩夏收作物已普遍追肥两到三次，腊肥已经压完。木兰公社仅在一天的积肥竞赛中，便积肥五十多万担。以积肥、备耕为内容的竞赛运动，把各项生产推向一个新高潮。全县人民在春节前五天，便积肥三千多万担，改革和修理农具二万八千多件，全部秧田都深耕了一次到两次，有的已施好底肥。一些派往孝感、麻城、新洲参观学习的代表已经回来，今年全县的首次大规模参观评比正在进行。（罗重璋）
    本报长沙18日电　湖南省辰溪县组织群众继续加干劲，加措施，像绣花一样，搞好油菜、麦子的田间管理，争取实现小麦亩产一千斤，油菜亩产四百斤以上。
    全县今年播种油菜五万四千零七十亩、麦子五万二千八百七十四亩，普遍长得比较好。但是，当县委提出再加一把劲，力争油菜麦子更大丰收时，有部分人却认为现在已经“定局”了，不愿再加工培育。县委认真分析了当前情况，认为力争麦子、油菜高产，是实现1959年农业生产更大跃进的重要一环。从当前来看，争取油菜、麦子高产有许多好条件。春天刚到，距油菜开花、麦子孕穗还有一个多月时间，现在正是生长时期，绝没有完全定局。因此，县委发出“突击抓好油麦中耕、追肥、防冻、间苗和补兜等管理工作，不准滑过一丘，力争全面高产”的号召，组织群众开展辩论。全县干部群众在认识了实现春收作物大丰收的重要意义后，都以实际行动积极响应县委的战斗号召。全县七个公社，共抽出五万多劳动力，组成一万多个作业小组，经过四天突击加工，全县十万多亩油菜、麦子，全部铺上了一层猪牛粪草，共追混合肥一千万担，平均每亩九十多担。全县人民更以“管理油麦如绣花”的精神，精细加工。胜利公社原家湾大队，将一千二百多亩油菜、麦子，根据居住条件分片，每片固定专人经常检查生长情况，并确定十三个专业队专管锄草、追肥、灭虫、防冻等工作。早晌，在检查中发现二百一十五亩油菜起了青虫和蜢子，大队随即组织社员用吸筒、扫帚、喷雾器等工具，突击三天扑灭了。
    全县人民经过十多天的苦干、巧干，块块油菜、麦子一片碧绿、崭齐，一般都有一尺五寸多深，三类苗全部消灭。　（孙孝建、朱绍超）
