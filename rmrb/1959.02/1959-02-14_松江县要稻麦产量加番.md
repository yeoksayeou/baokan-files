    Songjiang County to Double Rice and Wheat Production
    (Our Shanghai, February 13th dispatch) A production leap forward campaign to strive for a per mu yield of 3,026 jin of grain this year is unfolding vigorously in Songjiang County, Shanghai.
    Songjiang County, rich in rice, is a famous land of fish and rice. The Songjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, after recent research and analysis, based on last year's overall bumper harvest in agriculture, proposed that this year the county plans to plant 760,000 mu of rice and wheat, doubling the output compared to last year, with an average per mu yield of 3,026 jin (annual double cropping yield of rice and wheat). At the same time, it will implement an all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and vigorously promote diversified operations. The county plans to raise 800,000 pigs this year, a threefold increase over last year, 3 million chickens and ducks, a fourteenfold increase over last year, raise and catch 550,000 dan of fish, plant 50,000 mu of vegetables, and vigorously plant trees. The communes should also actively develop agricultural tool repair and manufacturing, as well as the industrial production of fertilizers, pesticides, cement, and other products.
    In order to achieve the above targets, the Songjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has formulated various measures. From "Beginning of Spring to Spring Plowing, ensure that: (1) Fertilizer is "in command," vigorously launching a manure collection and production campaign, and completing 70% to 80% of the annual manure accumulation plan before spring plowing, to meet the needs of topdressing for the early-maturing crops and base fertilizer for the late-maturing crops. (2) Strengthen the field management of the three wheats (wheat, barley, naked barley), rapeseed, green manure, and broad beans with the spirit of "continuous revolution," achieving "no stop to management until harvest." And resolutely "eliminate the third-class seedlings, improve the second-class seedlings, and promote the first-class seedlings." (3) Deep plow and deep turn the soil, level the land, and improve the soil. In addition to the 340,000 mu already deep-plowed during the autumn plowing period last year, another 340,000 mu will be turned before spring sowing. (4) Seize favorable opportunities to eliminate pests and diseases in winter. (5) Regulate good seeds, raise plough cattle well, repair farm tools, and train various technical hands to fully prepare for spring plowing.
    After these advanced production increase targets and measures were issued, the seventeen people's communes in the county immediately convened emergency meetings to study the development of production competitions and carry out work such as comparing drive and comparing measures. At present, a manure collection army of more than 100,000 people is vigorously engaged in the manure collection campaign in conjunction with water conservancy, field management, pest control, and the Spring Festival clean-up, and has accumulated more than 200 million dan of manure in less than half a month. In addition, more than 30,000 people have been mobilized to carry out another round of surprise topdressing on 330,000 mu of summer-maturing crops such as wheat and rapeseed that have undergone two to three topdressings, resolutely eliminating the third-class seedlings. In order to achieve an all-round bumper harvest, commune members in various communes are also stepping up the selection of good seeds and the overhauling of farm tools. (Wang Hongxian)

    松江县要稻麦产量加番
    本报上海13日电　争取今年粮食亩产三千零二十六斤的生产跃进运动正在上海市松江县轰轰烈烈地展开。
    松江县盛产水稻，是著名的鱼米之乡。中共松江县委最近经过研究分析，在去年农业全面丰产的基础上，提出今年全县计划种植七十六万亩稻麦，产量比去年翻一番，平均亩产三千零二十六斤（稻麦全年复种产量）。同时实行农林牧副渔全面大发展，大抓多种经营。全县今年计划养猪八十万头，比去年增加三倍，鸡鸭三百万只，比去年增产十四倍，养鱼捕鱼五十五万担，种植蔬菜五万亩，并大搞种树。公社还要积极发展农具修配制造和化肥、农药、水泥等工业生产。
    中共松江县委为了争取实现上述指标，制定了各种措施。从“立春到春耕，保证做到：（一）肥料“挂帅”，大力开展积肥造肥运动，要在春耕前先完成全年积肥计划的70％到80％，满足小熟追肥和大熟基肥的需求。（二）以“不断革命”精神加强三麦（小麦、大麦、元麦）、油菜、绿肥和蚕豆的田间管理工作，做到“不收管理不停”。并且要坚决“消灭三类苗，提高二类苗，促进一类苗”。（三）深耕深翻，平整土地，改良土壤，全县除去年秋耕期间已深翻三十四万亩以外，春播前再翻三十四万亩。（四）抓住有利时机，在冬季消灭病虫害。（五）调剂良种，养好耕牛，修好农具，训练各种技术手，全面做好备耕工作。
    这个先进的增产指标和措施下达后，全县十七个人民公社立即召开紧急会议，研究了开展生产竞赛和进行了比干劲比措施等工作。目前，一支十万多人的积肥大军正在结合水利、田间管理、除虫、春节大扫除等工作大搞积肥运动，不到半个月，已积肥二亿多担。此外，又出动了三万多人，在经过二次到三次追肥的三十三万亩小麦、油菜等夏熟作物上，再进行一次突击追肥，坚决消灭三类苗。为了全面获得丰产，各公社社员也在加紧选良种和检修农具等工作。（王洪仙）
