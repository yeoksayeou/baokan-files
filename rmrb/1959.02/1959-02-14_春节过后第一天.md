    The First Day After Spring Festival
    Our Correspondent

    In Beijing
    A Flying Start
    Just as the sky was beginning to lighten, amidst the deafening sound of gongs and drums and firecrackers, the workers of the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory joyfully thronged into the factory gates, beginning their first day of work after the Spring Festival. Instantly, a scene of bustling labor emerged in every workshop: some were inspecting machines, some were hanging belt hooks, some were adjusting the weaving mouths... Those busily engaged in various pre-production preparations included not only the workers of the C shift but also many workers from the A shift, B shift, regular day shift, and the maintenance team. To enable the machines, which had been idle for several days, to quickly return to normal operation, they automatically formed a support contingent of three to four hundred people to help. Li Meihua, an old worker in the spinning workshop and a mother of four, was not scheduled to work until 2:30 in the afternoon, but she arrived early in the morning from her home, which was six or seven *li* away from the factory.

    Everything was ready. At 5:45, forty-five minutes ahead of the scheduled start time, the machines in all the workshops were started. The workers labored, seizing every minute and second: the machine operators skillfully and nimbly pieced broken threads, the doffers doffed on time, their eyes fixed intently on the spinning machines, constantly cleaning back and forth…

    At 5:00 p.m., the planning department tallied the production figures for the first shift after the Spring Festival. The figures showed that all production targets were completed very well: cotton yarn output reached 121.6%, the first-grade rate of cotton yarn reached 100%, cotton cloth output reached 109.3%, and the mixed storage first-grade rate of cotton cloth reached 106.3%.

    Higher Efficiency Than Before Spring Festival
    As soon as the workers of the first shift of the lathe group in the metalworking workshop of the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Factory entered the workshop, they shouted: "We fought hard before the Spring Festival, took a break during the Spring Festival, and now we're going to have a 'decisive battle'!" While speaking, they started the machines, and the workshop, which had been silent for five days, resounded with deafening roars once again.

    Lathe operator Li Yurong had just returned from visiting relatives in his hometown on the night of the fourth day of the Lunar New Year, and he was the first to arrive at the workshop on the fifth day, feeling full of energy. To improve efficiency, he had created a multi-edged lathe tool before the Spring Festival. On this day, he operated this new tool, working vigorously and skillfully, and completed the entire day's workload by 12:00 noon. He focused intently on operating the whirling lathe, not even hearing the meal bell. On this day, he and his apprentice, Yun Suqing, together overfulfilled their task by more than 84%. The other workers were not to be outdone. Grinder Qin Hongsheng was determined to make contributions in the "decisive battle." In just three hours, he "annihilated" fifteen hours' worth of work.

    The intense battle made everyone forget fatigue and forget the time. It was not until the second shift workers came to take over that everyone realized it was time to get off work. When the production team leader announced that the entire shift's production man-hours had exceeded the quota by 55%, 10% higher than the efficiency before the Spring Festival, everyone immediately beat the drums of victory and reported the good news to the workshop leaders.

    The Early Bird Has Another Who Arrives Earlier
    More than an hour before work, Li Baolin, the foreman of the bricklayer team at the Beijing Plastics Factory construction site, and bricklayers Liu Jinsheng and Hou Junjie rode their bicycles with lights on to work. Li Baolin said to his two partners: "I'm worried that Shi Leng, who lives in Liangxiang, won't be able to squeeze onto the bus and won't be able to get to work on time." As soon as they entered the construction site, they found someone shoveling dirt in the ditch. As they approached, Li Baolin couldn't help but exclaim: "Old Shi, it's you! We were just worried that you wouldn't be able to come!" Shi Leng raised his head and said with a smile: "I rode my bicycle from Liangxiang yesterday noon. When I got to the construction site, I took a shower. I went to bed at 8:00 p.m., had a comfortable sleep, and prepared to fire the first shot of production after the Spring Festival with full energy today."

    More than half an hour before work, the workers in the group arrived one after another. On this day, each person dug an average of three cubic meters of soil, exceeding the production task by 50%.

    In Tianjin
    Preparations Made Early
    On February 12th, as the stars still twinkled in the sky, the workers of the early shift at the Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Factory arrived at the factory one after another. As soon as they stepped into the workshop, they found that someone had already made preparations for production and the machines were being test-run. It turned out that to ensure a flying start after the holiday, many veteran workers and workshop cadres at the factory had come to the factory the night before to prepare for work. They first lit the heating stoves in the workshop, then inspected the machines and tools. At more than three o'clock in the morning, after they had filled each machine tool with coolant, the machines were started and running. In this way, they avoided the time that workers in previous years needed to spend half an hour preparing for production after returning to work after the Spring Festival.

    To support the countryside and ensure a bumper harvest of grain and cotton this year, the Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Factory mobilized all its employees to engage in a tense battle to rush the production of irrigation and drainage machinery. On the first day after the Spring Festival, the workers were even more motivated to produce, and many people overfulfilled their tasks. Yang Xiuzhi turned twenty crankshafts for gas engines on this day, exceeding the quota by one time. To make the gas engines installed quickly and leave the factory early, the workers in the final assembly workshop sent people to the workshops where parts were processed to collect crankshafts, camshafts, and other parts. As soon as the processing workshops produced them, they would take them back and install them.

    Daily Plan Completed Ahead of Schedule
    The Tianjin Belt Conveyor Factory has recently undertaken the task of supporting a large number of belt conveyors for coal mines such as Yangquan, Jiaozuo, Fengfeng, and Fenxi, and mines in Baotou and Daye. To ensure the completion of this arduous and glorious task, all employees of the factory decided to launch a "High-Yield, High-Quality Welcome Spring Red Competition Week" after the Spring Festival. February 12th was the first day of the competition week.

    The machinists' section, which had overfulfilled its February early ten-day plan by 39% on February 6th, was even more motivated on this day. The attendance rate of the large machine tool group reached 100%. The masters came early, and the apprentices came even earlier. Only worker Liu Yunhua came the latest, but he was also a quarter of an hour early. Fitter Wang Zhiying went home to visit relatives in Wuqing County during the Spring Festival. On the 11th, he missed the train, so he rode his bicycle more than 100 *li* and returned in time. During the Spring Festival holiday, many veteran workers automatically went to the factory to inspect the machinery and equipment and prepare the cutting tools, so the production situation in the factory today was very good. In the afternoon, the good news of the early completion of the daily plan was constantly spread from various production groups:

    The large machine tool group completed its daily plan three hours ahead of schedule.

    Chen Jiasheng, a worker in the new machine group, completed six hours of tasks in two hours, and Dong Wenkui did two days' worth of work in one day.

    The entire factory completed the daily production plan two hours ahead of schedule.

    Seizing Steel by the Open-Hearth Furnace
    The workers who were on vacation were full of energy on the first day. What about those who did not take a break during the Spring Festival?

    The steelworkers of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of the Tianjin Steel Plant, who maintained full attendance from the first to the fourth day of the Lunar New Year, maintained full attendance on the early shift on the 12th as well, and intensified their efforts for the first "High-Yield, High-Quality, Accident-Free Week" after the holiday.

    To produce steel early and produce good steel, No. 1 open-hearth furnace slagged off ahead of schedule. The furnace door was half-open, and the workers used stalks and rakes to rake. Steel slag and fierce fire sprayed downwards like a red waterfall. The fire-line command post was set up next to the furnace. The broadcaster paid tribute loudly to the fighters seizing steel against time and broadcast the challenge letters of the workers of No. 1 and No. 2 open-hearth furnaces competing with each other. Cadres of the Party branch also wore asbestos clothing and pants to participate in the battle. The secretaries of the branch factory and the general factory also went to the open-hearth furnace to observe the boiling molten steel through black lenses. Workers constantly shuttled back and forth, sending manganese iron, bauxite and other ingredients and desulfurization lime into the furnace with large shovels, or blowing air into the furnace to break blocks and taking samples for testing. Their heads and faces were covered with bean-sized beads of sweat, but in the interval that should have been used to catch their breath, they also used sledgehammers to break large pieces of manganese iron and lime, and clean the ground in front of the furnace.

    At 1:12 noon, the steel was tapped, and the molten steel flowed and the steel flowers splashed. The workers also felt like flowers were blooming in their hearts: they had produced another furnace of high-quality steel for the country. At more than 2 o'clock, there was a burst of gongs and drums in various work sections and groups in the steelmaking plant, and they flocked to the fire-line command post and the Party branch to report the good news. In the joyful early spring, production successes were frequently reported.

    Tianjin Steel Plant No. 1 Steelmaking Plant's steelworkers regarded 12:00 on the 12th to 12:00 on the 13th as a high-yield day. This is a steelmaking worker in the advanced group of Qi Zisheng at the No. 1 open-hearth furnace making steel.

    春节过后第一天
    本报记者
    在北京
    旗开得胜
    天刚蒙蒙亮，在一片震耳的锣鼓声和鞭炮声中，国营北京第一棉纺织厂的工人们兴高彩烈地拥进了工厂的大门，开始了春节后的第一个劳动日。顿时，各个车间呈现出一片繁忙的劳动景象：有的在检查机器，有的在挂皮带钩，有的在对织口……。在这里忙着做各种生产前准备工作的，不仅有当班的丙班工人，还有许多甲班、乙班、常日班和保全组的工人。为了使停转了几天的机器能够很快地正常运转，她们自动地组成了三四百人的支援大队赶来帮忙。四个孩子的妈妈、细纱车间老工人李美华，应该在下午两点半才当班，但她一早就从离厂六七里的家里赶来了。
    一切都准备停当。五点四十五分，比上班时间提前了四十五分钟，各车间的机器就都开动了起来。工人们分秒必争地劳动着：挡车工敏捷灵巧地接着断头，落纱工按时在落纱，她们目不转睛地注视着纺纱机，来回不断地做清洁工作……。
    下午五点钟，计划科统计出了春节后第一班的生产数字。数字说明，各项生产指标完成得非常出色：棉纱产量完成121.6％，棉纱一等品率完成100％，棉布产量完成109.3％，棉布的混合入库一等品率完成106.3％。
    工效高过春节前
    北京汽车制造厂金工车间车工组第一班的工人们一进车间，就嚷着：咱们春节前苦战，春节休战，现在要来个“歼灭战”！一边说，一边开动机器，寂静了五天的车间，又响起了震耳的轰鸣声。
    车工李玉荣初四夜里刚从家乡探亲归来，初五第一个来到车间，感到浑身是劲。为了提高工效，春节前夕，他创造了多刃车刀。初五这天，他操纵着这个新工具，猛干巧干，在中午十二点就完成了全天的工作量。他专注地操纵着飞旋的车床，连吃饭铃也没听见。这一天，他和徒弟云素清一起，超额84％以上完成任务。其他工人们也不示弱，磨工秦洪生下定决心要在“歼灭战”中立功，仅仅三个小时，他就“歼灭”了十五个小时的活儿。
    紧张的战斗，使大家忘记了疲劳，忘记了时间。直到第二班工人来接班，大家才知道下班了。当生产组长宣布全班的生产工时超额55％，比春节前夕的工效还高10％以上的时候，大家立刻敲起了胜利的锣鼓，向车间领导报喜。
    早来更有早到人
    离上班还有一个多小时，北京塑料厂工地的瓦工小组长李宝林和瓦工刘金生、侯俊杰就骑着亮着灯的自行车来上工了。李宝林向两个伙伴说：“我耽心住在良乡的史楞会挤不上车，不能准时来上班。”他们一进工地，发现挖土场有一个人在地沟里铲土，走近一看，李宝林禁不住叫了起来：“老史，原来是你！刚才我们还在耽心你来不了呢！”史楞抬起头来笑嘻嘻地说：“我在昨天中午就从良乡骑车赶来了。到了工地，洗了一个澡。晚八时就躺在床上，舒舒服服地睡了一大觉，准备今天精神饱满地打响春节后生产的第一炮。”
    离上班还有半个多小时，组内的工人都陆续赶来了。这一天，平均每人挖了三立方土，超额50％完成了生产任务。
    在天津
    准备工作作得早
    2月12日，天空还闪耀着星光，天津市内燃机厂上早班的工人就陆续来到工厂。他们一踏进车间，发现早已有人作好了生产准备工作，机床在试运转着。原来为了保证作到节后开门红，这个厂的许多老工人、车间干部们都在头天夜间来到工厂作开工的准备工作。他们先把车间的取暖火炉升着火，然后检查机床和工具，凌晨三点多钟，当他们把每台机床灌满冷却液后，机床就开动运转了。这样，就避免了往年工人春节上班后需要花费半个多小时作生产准备工作的时间。
    天津市内燃机厂为了支援农村确保今年粮棉大丰收，全厂职工全力投入突击赶制排灌机械的紧张战斗。春节后的第一天，工人们的生产劲头更足，许多人都超额完成了任务。杨秀芝这一天车了二十根煤气机的曲轴，超过定额一倍。总装车间的工人为了使煤气机装得快、早出厂，他们自己派人到加工部件的车间里去取曲轴、凸轮轴等部件，只要加工车间一生产出来，他们就取回来安装上。
    提前完成日计划
    天津市皮带运输机厂最近承担了支援阳泉、焦作、峰峰、汾西等煤矿和包头、大冶等地矿山大批皮带运输机的任务。为了保证完成这一艰巨光荣的任务，全厂职工决定在春节以后开展“高产优质迎春红竞赛周”。12日是竞赛周的第一天。
    在2月6日就超额39％完成了2月上旬计划的机工工段，12日这天的干劲更足了。大型机床组的出勤率达到百分之百，师傅来得早，徒弟来得更早，只有工人刘云华来得最晚，但是也提前一刻钟到班了。钳工王志英在春节回家乡武清县探亲，11日他没有搭上火车，就骑着自行车走了一百多里及时地赶了回来。许多老工人在春节休假期间自动地到厂检查了机器设备，准备好了刀具，使全厂今天的生产情况十分良好。下午，各个生产小组就不断地传出提前完成当日计划的捷报：
    大型机床组，提前三小时完成了当日的计划。
    新机小组工人陈家声用两小时完成了六小时的任务，董文奎一天干了两天的活。
    全厂提前两小时完成了当日的生产计划。
    马丁炉旁夺钢战
    休假的工人们第一天干劲十足，那些春节不休假的人们，情况又怎样？
    从农历初一到初四始终保持全勤的天津钢厂第一炼钢厂的炼钢工人们，12日早班依旧保持全勤，而且为节后第一个“高产优质无事故周”而加紧奋战。
    为了早出钢，出好钢，一号平炉提前扒渣了。炉门半启，工人用秆通、用扒子扒，钢渣和烈火就像红色的瀑布一样往下喷。火线指挥部就设在炉旁，广播员在大声向跟时间夺钢的战士们致敬，并播送一、二号平炉工人互相竞赛的挑战书。党总支的干部也穿了石棉衣裤参加了战斗，分厂和总厂的党的书记也都到平炉上透过黑镜片观察沸腾的钢水。工人们不断穿梭般地用大铣往炉里投送锰铁、矾土等配料和脱硫用的白灰石或者向炉里吹气破块、取样化验，满头满脸都冒着豆大的汗珠，但就在应该喘口气的间歇时间，他们还使大锤敲碎大块的锰铁、白灰石，清理炉前地面。
    中午一点十二分，出钢了，钢水奔流、钢花飞溅。工人们心里也像开了花：又给国家生产了一炉优质钢。二点多钟，炼钢厂里各个工段、小组一片锣鼓声，纷纷拥向火线指挥部和党总支报捷。欢乐的早春，频传生产的喜讯。（附图片）
