Concentrating Manpower and Resources, Prioritizing the Big Picture over the Small
Shaanxi Reorganizes Mechanical Production

(Our dispatch) In the spirit of treating the entire nation as a single chessboard, Shaanxi Province recently arranged the production of the machinery industry for the first quarter. It designated production tasks assigned by the Central government and products for collaboration with brother provinces as the central tasks for the current period. It will concentrate existing materials, equipment, and labor to ensure the completion of these products as a prerequisite for arranging the production of equipment needed by the province.

At present, various machinery factories have already taken active actions according to this arrangement. In order to complete the tasks ahead of schedule, before the state allocates materials, many machinery factories are taking out their own inventory materials, and using materials that meet the specifications immediately for production. When they encounter a lack of qualified materials, various factories support and regulate each other. Some factories also use indigenous methods to produce auxiliary materials. This has greatly accelerated the speed of production. After accepting the task of producing fifty-one 400-liter concrete mixers, the Shaanxi Provincial Construction Machinery Factory started production with the materials currently available in the factory before the materials were allocated. Most of the parts are now being processed. The mechanical processing power of this factory is relatively small, so they temporarily stopped the mechanical processing of other products and first carried out the processing of mixer parts. In order to solve the problem of insufficient auxiliary materials, the employees produced coke, water glass, oxygen, calcium carbide, etc. by themselves. The Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory accepted the task of producing 500 twenty-four-row seeders. They have already produced 165 units with materials from the factory and are expected to complete the production of seeders by the end of February.

In order to ensure the completion of the central tasks on schedule and ahead of schedule, in addition to resolutely "giving way" to the central tasks with local tasks, various machinery factories have also inspected some semi-finished products produced in the past. Any products that are of the same variety and specifications as the products distributed by the Central government are quickly made into finished products and matched into sets to meet the needs of relevant central departments and brother provinces as soon as possible. The Shaanxi Provincial Machinery Industry System originally planned to produce 200 sets of blowers in the first quarter of this year to equip the province's small blast furnaces. Recently, relevant central departments decided that Shaanxi Province would produce 180 sets of blowers for Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia and other provinces (regions). For this reason, Shaanxi Province decided to give priority to meeting the needs of brother provinces with these blowers that are currently being produced, and then arrange the production of the province.

The relevant departments also paid special attention to organizing the collaborative production of various factories in arranging this task. This year, Shaanxi Province has undertaken the task of supporting mechanical equipment for more than 20 provinces (regions) across the country. The number of products is large and the time requirement is urgent. Moreover, many of the large-scale equipment have not been produced in the past. In order to overcome these difficulties, the relevant departments organized dozens of machinery factories in the province into a strong collaborative network, allowing each factory to divide the work and cooperate, and use methods such as "turning big into small, combining small into big" and "ants gnawing at bones" to produce components on large equipment, and then assemble them together into a complete set of equipment. For example, this time Shaanxi Province accepted the task of producing 80 100-horsepower boilers. According to the current equipment conditions of local industry in the province, no factory can produce them independently. After the Provincial Machinery Bureau mobilized various factories to study, it was determined that 14 units including Xi'an Machinery Factory No. 1 would collaborate in production, which solved the equipment and technical problems.

At the end of last year, Shaanxi Province made arrangements for the production tasks of the province's machinery industry in the first quarter according to the needs of the province's production and construction, and various factories had already started production according to this arrangement. Recently, after accepting the tasks uniformly assigned by the Central government, the relevant departments reorganized the production of the machinery industry according to the principle of "Central government first, local second." During the arrangement, the cadres were mobilized to discuss the issue of "the entire nation as a single chessboard," and the erroneous ideas of some cadres who emphasized the weak production capacity of their units, were unwilling to support brother provinces and cities with equipment and materials produced for themselves, and some factories were unwilling to undertake the production tasks of a small number of sporadic products were criticized. Through the discussion, the cadres of various units have more clearly realized that only by ensuring the completion of the tasks assigned by the Central government can we speed up the socialist construction of the entire country and ensure a greater leap forward this year.

    集中人力物力  先大局后小局
    陕西重新安排机械生产
    本报讯　根据全国一盘棋的精神，陕西省最近对机械工业第一季度的生产进行了安排，将中央分配的生产任务和与兄弟省协作的产品作为当前的中心任务，在集中现有的材料、设备和劳动力确保完成这些产品的前提下，安排本省所需设备的生产。
    目前，各机械厂已经根据这一安排积极行动起来。为了提前完成任务，在国家没有调来材料以前，很多机械厂都把自己的库存材料拿出来，把合乎规格的材料立即用到生产上去；遇到缺乏合格材料的情况，各厂就互相支援、调剂；有些厂还用土办法生产辅助材料。这就大大加快了生产速度。陕西省建筑机械厂接受了五十一台四百公升混凝土搅拌机的任务后，在材料没有调拨到以前，他们先用本厂现存的材料生产，现在大部分零件已在进行加工。这个厂的机械加工力量比较小，他们就把其他产品的机械加工暂时停下来，首先进行搅拌机零件的加工；为了解决辅助材料不足的问题，职工们自己动手生产焦炭、玻璃水、氧气、电石等。西安农业机械厂接受了五百台二十四行播种机的任务，他们已经用厂内的材料生产了一百六十五台，预计2月底可以全部完成播种机的生产任务。
    各机械厂为了保证按期和提前完成中央的任务，除了坚决作到地方任务给中央任务
  “让路”以外，还检查了过去生产的一些半成品，凡是品种和规格与中央分配的产品相同的，就迅速制成成品并且配成套，尽先满足中央有关部门和兄弟省的需要。陕西省机械工业系统原计划今年第一季度生产二百套鼓风机，以装备本省的小高炉；最近中央有关部门决定陕西省为青海、新疆、宁夏等省
  （区）生产一百八十套鼓风机，为此，陕西省决定将正在生产的这些鼓风机首先满足兄弟省的需要，然后再安排本省的生产。
    有关部门在安排这次任务中还特别注意组织各厂的协作生产。今年陕西省承担了支援全国二十多个省（区）机械设备的任务，产品数量大，时间要求急，而且其中很多大型设备是过去没有生产过的。为了克服这些困难，有关部门把全省几十个机械厂组织成一个强大的协作网，让各厂分工协作，用“化大为小，以小并大”和“蚂蚁啃骨头”等办法生产大型设备上的部件，然后拼在一起，安装成整套的设备。例如这次陕西省接受生产八十台一百马力锅炉的任务，根据目前全省地方工业的设备条件，没有一个厂能够单独生产。省机械局发动各厂研究以后，确定由西安机械一厂等十四个单位协作生产，这样就解决了设备和技术方面的问题。
    去年年底，陕西省曾根据本省生产和建设的需要，对全省机械工业第一季度的生产任务作了安排，各厂已经根据这个安排开始生产。最近接受了中央统一分配的任务后，有关部门又根据“先中央，后本地”的原则对机械工业的生产进行了重新安排。并在安排时发动干部讨论了“全国一盘棋”的问题，批判了某些干部强调本单位生产能力薄弱，不愿把为自己生产的设备和材料支援兄弟省市，某些工厂不愿担任少量零星产品的生产任务等错误思想。通过讨论，各单位的干部更加明确认识到只有确保完成中央分配的任务，才能加快全国的社会主义建设速度，才能保证今年更大的跃进。
