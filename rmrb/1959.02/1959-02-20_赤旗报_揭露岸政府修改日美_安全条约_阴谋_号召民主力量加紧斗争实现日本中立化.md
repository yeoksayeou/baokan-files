Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 19th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Red Flag," published an editorial today, calling on all party members to fight for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the realization of Japan's neutralization.

The editorial stated that the most important question facing the Japanese people today is: should maintaining and strengthening the Japan-U.S. military alliance be the fundamental policy of the country, or should breaking away from the Japan-U.S. military alliance and pursuing a peaceful and neutral policy be the fundamental policy of the country? The editorial pointed out that in a situation where Japan has formed an aggressive military alliance with U.S. imperialism, it is unimaginable to want Japan to take the road of peaceful development, break away from its subordination to the United States and gain independence, prevent Japan from becoming a militarist and fascist country, defend democracy, and create conditions for improving living standards.

The editorial emphasized the importance of the statement "Hold High the Banner of Peace and Neutrality, Smash the Conspiracy to Revise the Security Treaty" issued by the Central Committee Cadre Conference of the Japanese Communist Party on the 13th, and called on all party members to do their utmost to make the Communist Party's policy of Japan's neutralization a demand of all the people.

The editorial pointed out that although differences of opinion have arisen within the Liberal Democratic Party regarding the revision of the "Security Treaty," this is not a fundamental opposition. The editorial called on Japan's democratic forces to thoroughly struggle against the Nobusuke Kishi government.

Xinhua News Agency, February 19th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Red Flag," published an article today, exposing the essence of the Nobusuke Kishi government's proposed plan to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" as betraying Japan's national interests and containing a war crisis. The article pointed out that this plan is to drag Japan onto the road of nuclear war.

According to Japanese newspapers, Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi yesterday held talks with Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama, Cabinet Secretary General Munenori Akagi, and Liberal Democratic Party Secretary General Takeo Fukuda to study the plan for revising the "Security Treaty." The core content of the Nobusuke Kishi government's plan includes the following points: (1) clarify the principle of so-called "joint defense" between Japan and the United States; (2) stipulate that U.S. troops can continue to be stationed in Japan and its vicinity; (3) Japan regards an "armed attack" on U.S. forces stationed in Japan as an attack on Japan, and thus must take "joint action" with the United States; (4) U.S. forces stationed in Japan can be dispatched to various parts of the Far East; (5) the treaty will have a term of ten years.

"Red Flag" exposed the dangerous essence of the above-mentioned content of this plan item by item. "Red Flag" pointed out that this plan rewrites the preamble of the treaty and clearly states the principle of "joint defense" between Japan and the United States, which means that even if Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands are excluded from the areas to which the treaty applies, this preamble is sufficient to enable Japan to participate in the "Northeast Asia Treaty Organization" planned by the United States.

"Red Flag" pointed out that this plan agrees that the U.S. military has the right to be stationed in Japan, which is completely contrary to the demands of the Japanese people. It is enough to show what the true intention of the Nobusuke Kishi government is in revising the "Security Treaty" under the guise of independence and equality.

"Red Flag" pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi government's plan stipulates that Japan must take "joint defense" measures with the United States when U.S. forces stationed in Japan are subjected to an "armed attack," and agrees that U.S. forces stationed in Japan can be dispatched to various regions in the Far East, which means that Japan will be tightly bound to the United States' war policy. "Red Flag" pointed out that even if, as Foreign Minister Fujiyama said, the treaty stipulates that Japan and the United States must conduct prior consultations when using U.S. forces stationed in Japan, in reality, such a provision is ineffective. On the contrary, this provision will create a situation in which the Japanese government agrees to U.S. military action in the Far East.

"Red Flag" pointed out that if this conspiracy of the Nobusuke Kishi government succeeds, the Nobusuke Kishi government will believe that it can rely on the military power of the United States and Japan, and its hostile attitude towards China, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries will become more blatant, and it will use military power to threaten Southeast Asian countries. The article pointed out that it can be seen from this that the negotiations between the Nobusuke Kishi government and the United States on revising the "Security Treaty" are a very dangerous conspiracy.

    “赤旗报”揭露岸政府修改日美“安全条约”阴谋
    号召民主力量加紧斗争实现日本中立化
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召全体党员为废除日美“安全条约”、实现日本的中立化而斗争。
    社论说，目前摆在日本人民面前的最重要的问题是：把维持和加强日美军事同盟作为国家的基本政策，还是把摆脱日美军事同盟、推行和平中立政策作为国家的基本政策？社论指出，在日本同美帝国主义结成侵略性军事同盟的情况下，想要使日本走和平发展的道路，摆脱从属美国的状态而获得独立，阻止日本变成军国主义和法西斯国家，保卫民主，创造提高生活水平的条件等等，是不可想像的。
    社论强调指出日本共产党中央委员会干部会在13日发表的“高举和平和中立的旗帜、粉碎修改安全条约的阴谋”的声明的重要意义，号召全体党员竭尽全力，为使共产党的关于日本中立化的政策成为全体人民的要求而奋斗。
    社论指出，虽然自由民主党内部围绕修改“安全条约”问题发生了意见分歧，但是这不是本质上的对立。社论号召日本的民主力量同岸信介政府彻底地进行斗争。
    新华社19日讯　日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表文章，揭露岸信介政府提出的关于修改日美“安全条约”的方案的出卖日本民族利益和包含着战争危机的本质。文章指出，这个方案是要把日本拖到核战争的道路上去。
    据日本报纸报道，日本首相岸信介昨天同外务相藤山爱一郎，内阁官房长官赤城宗德和自由民主党干事长福田赳夫举行了会谈，研究了关于修改“安全条约”的方案。岸信介政府的方案的中心内容包括以下几点：（一）明确日本和美国进行所谓“共同防御”的原则；（二）规定美国军队可以继续驻在日本国内及其附近的地区；（三）日本把对于驻日美军的“武装进攻”看作是对日本进攻，从而要同美国采取“联合行动”；（四）驻日美军可以向远东各地出动；（五）条约的期限为十年。
    “赤旗报”逐项揭露了这个方案的上述内容所具有的危险本质。“赤旗报”指出，这个方案改写了条约的前文，明确地表明了日本和美国采取“共同防御”的原则，这意味着：即使把冲绳、小笠原划在条约适用地区以外，根据这项前文，也足以使日本能够参加美国策划建立的“东北亚条约组织”。
    “赤旗报”指出，这个方案同意美军有权驻在日本，这是完全违反日本人民的要求的。它足以表明岸信介政府假借独立、平等的美名来修改“安全条约”的真正企图是什么。
    “赤旗报”指出，岸信介政府的方案规定日本在驻日美军遭到“武装进攻”时要同美国采取“共同防御”措施，而且同意驻日美军可以出动到远东各地区，这意味着要把日本紧紧地束缚在美国的战争政策上。“赤旗报”指出，即使像外务相藤山所说，条约中已经规定在使用驻日美军时，日美两国要进行事前协商，但是，实际上这样的规定是没有任何效果的。相反地，由于这种规定，倒将造成日本政府同意美军在远东采取行动的情况。
    “赤旗报”指出，如果岸信介政府的这种阴谋得逞，岸信介政府自以可以依恃美日军事力量，它对中国、苏联和其他社会主义国家的敌对态度将会更加露骨，同时将用军事力量来威胁东南亚国家。文章指出，由此可以看出，岸信介政府同美国进行的修改“安全条约”的谈判是一个非常危险的阴谋。（附图片）
