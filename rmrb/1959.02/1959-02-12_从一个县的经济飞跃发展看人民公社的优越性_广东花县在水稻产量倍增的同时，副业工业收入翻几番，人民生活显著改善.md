    Seeing the Superiority of People's Communes from the Economic Leap Forward of a County
    Guangdong's Hua County Doubles Rice Production While Sideline Industry Income Multiplies Several Times, and People's Lives Improve Significantly
    (Our Correspondent Du Daozheng reports) The people's communes in Hua County, Guangdong Province, achieved great results in the fourth quarter of last year by simultaneously engaging in sideline occupations and industries while focusing their main efforts on agriculture and steel production, once again powerfully demonstrating the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune system.
    In the fourth quarter of last year, the communes in Hua County completed and overfulfilled their tasks in steel production, autumn harvest, water conservancy, and deep plowing. The autumn harvest was completed in early November. By November 20, the task of smelting 439 tons of steel and 6,018 tons of iron was completed. The scale of deep plowing and soil improvement was even larger, with 85,000 people mobilized daily, deep plowing a total of 390,000 mu (including 73,000 mu with layered fertilization and 65,622 mu with smoked soil). The amount of accumulated fertilizer reached an average of 220 dan per mu. Water conservancy was also carried out well, and the Liuxi River Hydropower Station has been completed. A 200-li-long main canal, five chi high and one zhang wide, and related reservoirs and branch canals are under construction. Upon completion, all but 99,021 mu of hilly land in Hua County will be able to be irrigated by gravity flow, with a drought resistance capacity of three months.
    While completing the above tasks, the communes vigorously developed sideline occupations and industries, achieving great results and greatly increasing the communes' cash income. Preliminary statistics show that the net profit from sideline occupations and industries was 18.43 million yuan, including 14 million yuan in cash and 4 million yuan in inventory. This figure is not only much higher than the total annual output value of sideline occupations before 1958 (for example, the total output value of sideline occupations was 3.45 million yuan in 1954 and 4.55 million yuan in 1957), but also 15 times higher than the 1.12 million yuan in the first quarter of 1958, nine times higher than the 1.7 million yuan in the second quarter, and seven times higher than the 2.11 million yuan in the third quarter. If this net income is divided equally among the county's 160,000 agricultural laborers, each person would receive 115 yuan. Currently, the income from sideline occupations and industries in the county's communes, plus the income from late-season crops (rice, sugarcane, sweet potatoes, and hemp), after paying off all new and old loans from the state bank from the original agricultural cooperatives and some production expenses after communization, and after paying monthly wages for November and December of last year and January of this year (an average of 3.20 yuan per laborer per month), and after distributing clothing allowances to each laborer before and after the New Year (an average of 5.20 yuan per person) without compensation, each commune still has a large amount of cash on hand. For example, the Huadong Commune, which has relatively low deposits, still has 740,000 yuan in the bank. The Tanbu Commune, which has done a better job in sideline occupations and industries, has, in addition to paying off the state's agricultural loans of 978,000 yuan accumulated in 1958 and previous years at once (only 130,000 yuan of agricultural loans that have not yet matured have not been paid), and paying three months' wages and clothing allowances, still had 1.1 million yuan in cash in the People's Bank as of January 23, enough to pay all its laborers (12,530 people) 17 months' wages (at 5 yuan per person per month).
    Hua County also achieved a bumper harvest in agriculture last year. The average yield of rice, combining early rice and late rice, was about 1,000 jin per mu, about double the average yield of 490 jin per mu of rice for the whole year in 1957. With the great development of sideline occupations and industries and the increase in cash income, people's lives have improved significantly. Due to the increase in people's purchasing power, the sales of general merchandise have greatly increased. For example, the turnover of the Xinhua Town department store was 3,000 yuan on the highest day before communization, and 13,000 yuan on the highest day after communization. At one time, even the black cloth, which is normally used by Guangdong farmers for clothing and rarely sold out, was out of stock.
    The county party committee summarized the commune-run sideline occupations and commune-run industries in Hua County into five words: digging, burning, raising, planting, and collecting. Digging includes digging white mud, coal, glass sand, limestone, quartz stone, and turf; burning includes burning red bricks, red tiles, and refractory bricks; raising includes raising pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, fish, and dairy cows; planting refers to planting vegetables; collecting includes collecting Chinese medicinal herbs in the mountains. In the fourth quarter of last year, all these projects developed considerably at the same time. For example, white mud is a major raw material for firing refractory bricks and refractory materials. One ton of dry white mud costs 24 yuan, and wet white mud costs 13 to 15 yuan. White mud is everywhere in Hua County, and an ordinary laborer can dig one ton a day with ordinary tools. Before the fourth quarter of last year, very little white mud was mined in Hua County. During the peak period of white mud mining in the fourth quarter, each commune mobilized more than 4,000 people a day, and the total number of people mobilized in the county in three months was 200,000, digging out 200,000 tons of white mud. Half of these 200,000 tons were sold directly to Guangzhou, and the other half was either burned into refractory bricks for sale (a total of 8,821 tons of refractory bricks were burned), or used for steel smelting or ceramics production. In the fourth quarter of last year alone, the net income from white mud production was about 3 million yuan, accounting for 16% of the total net income of 18.43 million yuan from sideline occupations and industries in the quarter. The vast majority of the red bricks and red tiles that were burned were sold to Guangzhou. Before the fourth quarter of last year, there were only ten brick and tile kilns, but in the fourth quarter, they suddenly developed to one hundred, with a net income of 6.43 million yuan, accounting for 36% of the total net income from sideline occupations and industries in the quarter. Other projects such as coal mining, vegetable planting, pig raising, and raising three kinds of poultry (chickens, ducks, and geese) have also made great progress. Before the fourth quarter of last year, there were very few people mining coal, and only 8,000 tons were mined in the first, second, and third quarters, while in the fourth quarter, there were 7,000 people who regularly mined coal every day, mining a total of 50,000 tons of coal, which satisfied the needs of their own communes for burning bricks and tiles, firing refractory bricks, and smelting steel. Ten thousand mu of vegetables were planted at once, and 400,000 jin are now sold to Guangzhou every day, worth 16,000 yuan.
    Why was this county able to manage so many sideline occupations and industries while advancing agriculture and steel production simultaneously? In addition to the superiority of the people's commune system, the compelling situation created by the Great Leap Forward, the resolute organization of specialized teams by the leadership, the establishment of full-time leading cadres, and the relatively liberated leadership thinking, as well as the resolute implementation of the central and provincial guidelines, there were also two objective reasons: one is that "there is a shortage on the ground but not underground." Hua County is poorer than other counties in the Pearl River Delta, especially in terms of fish and rice; but it has many mountains, and there are resources under the mountains. For example, white mud, which costs thirteen yuan per ton, can be found in many places. Another example is coal. According to current surveys, there are 110 million tons, and it is estimated that there are about 500 million tons. Many coalfields can be mined in the open air. Hua County has many underground resources, and these resources are urgently needed by everyone, so there is no problem with sales. The other is that although the work tasks in the fourth quarter of last year were heavy, they were not as tight as the production tasks in spring, summer, and autumn. After overall planning, it was entirely possible to draw part of the labor force to run industries and sideline occupations. For example, the Tanbu Commune has an open-pit coal mine. When mining, it is necessary to use the method of splitting mountains to remove a large amount of soil. The labor force required for this work is not counted in dozens or hundreds of people, but in five hundred or a thousand people. If it were an agricultural cooperative, it would be impossible to draw so many laborers to split mountains. After communization, however, manpower can be uniformly dispatched and concentrated, and it is easy to draw 500 people to form a specialized team to mine day and night. Now the daily output is 500 tons, which is very profitable. This commune also has the following example: the original Langtou Agricultural Cooperative (now the Langtou Company of the Tanbu Commune) had white mud but no coal, and the original Qucun Agricultural Cooperative (now the Qucun Company of the Tanbu Commune) had coal but no white mud, and both had difficulties in firing refractory bricks. Now that they have formed a commune, the difficulties of both have been solved. Three hundred people have been transferred to establish a refractory brick factory, which produces 10,000 pieces per day, worth more than 6,000 yuan. For example, before the establishment of the Chikeng Commune, the Bajiang Agricultural Cooperative had abundant resources such as white mud, glass sand, and natural sand (raw materials for making refractory materials and glass), but the Bajiang Agricultural Cooperative was small and had a large amount of land, with an average of 13 mu of land per laborer, making it unable to exploit the resources; while several nearby agricultural cooperatives had a large population and little land, with a surplus labor force, but lacked white mud, glass sand, and other resources. After the people's commune was established, the above contradictions were resolved. A part of the labor force was transferred to form a specialized team to specialize in the development of natural sand. Now it can produce 70 to 80 tons per day, with a net income of about 2,000 yuan per day.
    In addition, the situation of the Great Leap Forward in the country played a great stimulating and promoting role in the operation of industries and sideline occupations by the people's communes in Hua County. Without the pressure of steel production, the white mud and coal in Hua County would not have been developed on a large scale so early, and the sideline occupations and industries in Hua County would not have been able to develop. Without the leap forward in capital construction, the many red bricks and red tiles burned in Hua County would have had no sales. Without the pressure of steel production, not only would there be things to sell but not be able to sell them, but first of all, things would not be produced. For example, due to the lack of refractory bricks, the stove had problems, the iron was not smelted well, and the county and the commune were very anxious. They went to other counties to visit and found that refractory bricks were fired with white mud (and other materials had to be added), and Hua County had an inexhaustible supply of white mud. Therefore, they returned to the county and built refractory brick factories, and the refractory bricks produced could not only be used by themselves but also be sold in large quantities.
    The most important experience of Hua County in being able to manage so many industries and sideline occupations while focusing its main efforts on water conservancy and deep plowing in the fourth quarter of last year was to adhere to the practice of organizing specialized teams and setting up full-time leading cadres. When the county focused on sideline occupations and industries in November of last year, the thinking of the main leading cadres at all levels was very contradictory. On the one hand, they wanted to focus on sideline occupations and industries to make some cash to solve difficulties; on the other hand, they felt that the tasks of water conservancy and deep plowing were large and feared that engaging in sideline occupations and industries would affect water conservancy and deep plowing. The county party committee implemented the instructions of the province, stipulating the proportion of labor used, organizing specialized teams, and determining that before New Year's Day, the labor force engaged in commune-run sideline occupations and industries should not exceed 25%; after New Year's Day, when the task of preparing for farming became larger, the percentage was reduced to less than 20%. This regulation gave the leading cadres a clear idea and made it easier to arrange. With a proportion and specialized teams, cadres and commune members could focus on their work and improve production efficiency. Two of the five secretaries of the county party committee were in charge of industry and sideline occupations, and one or two secretaries of the commune party committee were also in charge of sideline occupations and industries.

    从一个县的经济飞跃发展看人民公社的优越性
    广东花县在水稻产量倍增的同时，副业工业收入翻几番，人民生活显著改善
    本报讯　记者杜导正报道：广东省花县各人民公社，去年第四季度内在以主要力量从事农业、钢铁业的情况下，同时大办副业、工业，取得了很大的成绩，再一次雄辩地证明了人民公社制度的无比优越性。
    花县各公社去年第四季度都按期完成和超额完成了钢铁、秋收、水利、深翻等任务。去年11月初完成了秋收。11月20日完成了炼钢四百三十九吨，炼铁六千零十八吨的任务。深翻改土的规模更大，每日出动八万五千人，共深翻三十九万亩（其中分层施肥的七万三千亩，熏土的六万五千六百二十二亩）。完成积肥数量每亩平均达二百二十担。水利也搞得不错，流溪河水电站已建成。一条长二百华里高五尺宽一丈的干渠，以及有关水库、支渠正在修建，完工后，花县除九万九千零二十一亩岗地不能浇水外，其余六十六万八千八百六十五亩田都可以做到自流灌溉，具有三个月的抗旱能力。
    在完成上述任务的同时，各公社大搞副业、工业，取得很大成绩，大大增加了公社的现金收入。据初步统计，副业、工业净挣纯收入一千八百四十三万元，其中现金一千四百万元，库存商品折款四百余万元。这个数字不仅比1958年以前全年的副业总产值多得多（例如1954年副业总产值为三百四十五万元，1957年为四百五十五万元），而且比1958年第一季的一百一十二万元多十五倍，比第二季的一百七十万元多九倍，比第三季的二百一十一万元也多七倍。这笔纯收入，以全县十六万个农业劳动力平均分配，每人可得一百一十五元。现在全县公社副业、工业收入，加上晚造（水稻、甘蔗、番薯、麻）的收入，除向国家银行付清原各农业社的所有新旧贷款及公社化后的一些生产开支，按月发放了去年11、12月和今年1月份的工资（每个劳动力每月工资平均三元二角），元旦前后给每个劳动力无偿地发放了一次衣服费（每人平均五元二角）外，各个公社手中仍存有大批现款。如花东公社存款是较少的社也在银行中有七十四万元的存款。副业和工业办得较好的炭步公社，更是除一次付清国家1958年和历年累计的农业贷款九十七万八千元（只有未到期的十三万元农贷未付），开支清三个月工资、衣服费以外，到1月23日止，仍在人民银行存现金一百一十万元，足够给它的全部劳动力（一万二千五百三十人）发放十七个月的工资（以每人每月五元计）。
    花县去年农业也获得了大丰收，水稻早稻加晚稻合在一起平均亩产一千斤左右，比1957年的全年水稻平均亩产四百九十斤增一倍左右。加上副业，工业的大发展，现金收入增多，人民生活有了显著改善。由于人民购买力的提高，百货商品销售额大增。如新华镇百货门市部公社化前营业额最高的一天达三千元，公社化后营业额最高的一天达一万三千元。有一个时期，甚至平常很少脱销的广东农民用作衣料的黑布也脱销了。
    县委把花县社办副业和社办工业概括为五个字，即：挖、烧、养、种、采。挖包括挖白坭、煤、玻璃沙、石灰石、石英石、坭炭土；烧包括烧红砖、红瓦、耐火砖；养包括养猪、鸡、鸭、鹅、鱼、羊、奶牛；种指种蔬菜；采包括上山采集中药材。在去年第四季度内，这许许多多项目，全都同时有相当大的发展。如白坭是一种烧制耐火砖和耐火材料的主要原料。一吨干白坭价二十四元，湿白坭十三至十五元。花县遍地是白坭，一个普通劳动力用普通工具一天能挖一吨。去年第四季度以前，花县极少挖白坭的。而在第四季度内挖白坭热闹的时候，各个公社一天出动过四千人，全县在三个月内先后出动的人数有二十万人次，挖出白坭二十万吨。这二十万吨，有一半直接卖给广州，另一半有一部分烧成耐火砖出卖（共烧成耐火砖八千八百二十一吨），有的自己炼钢铁或制成陶瓷用了。去年第四季度内仅白坭生产一项，纯收入就在三百万元左右，占季度副业、工业总纯收入一千八百四十三万元的16％。烧的红砖红瓦绝大部分卖给了广州。去年第四季度以前只有十座砖瓦窑，第四季度一下子发展到一百座，纯收入达六百四十三万元，占全季度副业、工业总纯收入的36％。其它如挖煤、种菜、养猪、养三鸟（鸡、鸭、鹅）都有很大的发展。去年第四季度前，挖煤的人很少，一、二、三季度只挖出八千吨，而在第四季度内每天固定挖煤的人有七千人，共挖出五万吨煤，满足了自己公社烧砖瓦、烧耐火砖和炼钢铁的需要。蔬菜一下子就种了十万亩，现在每天卖给广州四十万斤，价值一万六千元。
    为什么这个县能在农业、钢铁齐头并进的情况下，办好那么多副业和工业呢？除了人民公社制度的优越性，大跃进造成的形势逼人，领导上坚决地组织了专业队，设置了专职领导干部和领导思想比较解放，执行中央和省的方针坚决等原因以外，客观上还有两个原因：一个是“地上缺地下不缺”。花县比珠江三角洲其它县贫苦，就鱼、米方面来说是如此；但它山多，山下尽是资源。如十三元一吨的白坭很多地方都可找到。又如煤，据现在已察明的有一亿一千万吨，估计在五亿吨左右，许多煤田可以露天开采。花县地下资源多，而这些资源又为大家迫切需要，销路不成问题。另一个是去年第四季度工作任务虽重，但没有春、夏、秋季生产任务那么紧张，经过统筹安排，完全可以抽出部分力量来办工业和副业。比如炭步公社，有一个露天煤矿，开采的时候，先要用劈山的办法，把大量土层剥去。这工作需要的劳动力，不是以几十人百把人计，而是五百人、一千人。如果是农业社，根本不可能抽出这么多劳动力来劈山。而公社化后，人力可以统一调度、集中使用，很容易地抽出了五百人，组成专业队，日夜开采，现在日产量为五百吨，收益很大。这个公社还有这样一个例子，原浪头农业社（现炭步公社的浪头连）有白坭没有煤，原区村农业社（现炭步公社的区村连）又有煤没有白坭，两家想烧制耐火砖都有困难。现在组成公社，两家的困难都解决了，调了三百人，成立了一个耐火砖厂，每日生产一万块，价值六千元以上。又如赤坑公社成立前，巴江农业社有白坭、玻璃沙、天然沙（制耐火材料和玻璃的原料）等丰富资源，但巴江农业社社小地多，一个劳动力要平均负担十三亩田，无力开采；而附近有几个农业社人多地少，有剩余劳力，但又缺白坭、玻璃沙等资源。人民公社化后，上述矛盾就解决了，调出一部分劳力成立专业队，专门从事天然沙的开发工作，现在一天可产七、八十吨，每天就有两千元左右的纯收入。
    此外，国家大跃进的形势对花县各人民公社办工业、副业更是起了极大的刺激、促进作用。没有钢铁的压力，花县的白坭、煤不会这么早的大量开发，花县的副业、工业也就发展不起来。没有基本建设的跃进，花县烧的那许多红砖红瓦就无销路。没有钢铁的压力，不只是有了东西卖不出去，首先是生产不出东西来。例如：缺耐火砖，炉子有毛病，铁炼得不好，县和公社很着急，到外县去参观，发现耐火砖就是用白坭烧的（还得加别的材料），而花县就有用不尽的白坭，因而回县就造起耐火砖来了，生产出来的耐火砖，除了供给自己使用外，还可大量外销。
    花县在去年第四季度以主要精力突击水利、深翻的同时，能够办好这么多工业和副业，最重要的一条经验是坚持了组织专业队和设置专职领导干部的做法。去年该县11月大抓副业和工业时，各级主要领导干部的思想很矛盾。一方面想大抓副业、工业搞点现金解决困难；另一方面又感到水利、深翻任务大，怕搞副业、工业影响了水利、深翻。县委执行了省的指示，规定劳动力使用的比例，组织专业队，确定元旦以前，搞社办副业、工业的劳动力不得超过25％；元旦以后，备耕任务大了，又将这个百分比压缩到20％以下。这个规定，就使领导干部心中有了数，容易安排。有了比例，有了专业队，干部和社员做事专心，生产效率也高。县委五个书记中有两个抓工业、副业，公社党委也有一两个书记专管副业和工业。
