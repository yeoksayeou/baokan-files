Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 20th – The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Housing and Welfare Department recently completed a coke-fired heating furnace. It uses waste heat from the coke oven to provide heating for people, saving coal for heating. Currently, this furnace produces more than three tons of coke per day while also providing heating for 400 households.

This type of heating coke oven has a simple structure. A row of water pipes is installed on top of the coking chamber and heating furnace, using the radiant heat from the top of the furnace to heat the cold water in the pipes. Then, the water can be pumped to residences. Constructing such a coke oven, which produces 1,400 tons of coke annually and also provides heating, requires only a little over five tons of steel and costs about 20,000 yuan in total. Compared with building a boiler room with the same heating capacity, the cost is 75% lower, and steel consumption is reduced by 80%. Its coal consumption is also 20% lower than heating with a boiler. At the same time, it can also recover coal tar and other by-products, achieving the effect of comprehensive utilization of coal. If this type of furnace is used in rural areas, in addition to producing coke, the recovered by-products can be used to manufacture chemical fertilizers, and the generated steam can be used to drive machinery or supply bathhouses and cafeterias.

    炼焦炉能取暖
    新华社鞍山20日电　鞍钢房产福利处，最近建成了一座炼焦采暖炉。它用炼焦炉的余热供人们采暖，可以节省采暖用煤。现在这座炉子每天产焦炭三吨多，同时供应四百户居民采暖。
    这种采暖炼焦炉，构造简单，就在炼焦炉的炭化室和加热炉的顶部，安上一排水管，利用炉顶的辐射热，把管子里的冷水加热，即可用水泵送到住宅。建设这样一座年产焦炭一千四百吨，又可以采暖的炼焦炉，只用五吨多钢材，全部造价两万元左右，与建筑同样一座采暖能力的锅炉房比较，造价低75％，钢材节省80％。它的煤耗比用锅炉采暖的煤耗还低20％。同时，它还可以回收煤焦油和其他副产品，达到综合利用煤炭的效果。这种炉子如果用于农村，除了生产焦炭以外，回收的副产品可以制造化学肥料，产生的蒸气，可以用来带动机器或供浴池、食堂用。
