　　Pre-made Elixirs Eliminate Disease, Guarantee a Smooth Great Leap Forward
　　Biological Products Institute Intensifies Production of Vaccines and Other Medicines

　　(Our report) To better prevent and control diseases and guarantee a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, all employees of the Ministry of Health's Biological Products Institute, on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, continue to exert their utmost efforts to produce more and better vaccines, diagnostic agents, sera, antibiotics, and other biological products for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. They have initially determined that this year's output value plan will increase by more than 80% compared to last year, the output of various products will significantly increase, the quality of products will also be greatly improved, the pass rate will reach 99%, the cost will be reduced by 10%, and four new products will be put into mass production.

　　Last year, thanks to the soaring enthusiasm of all employees, the institute overfulfilled its production and research work plans, basically guaranteeing the needs of epidemic prevention work. This year, in order to achieve higher production targets, all units are now summarizing the experience of production technology innovation and research work in 1958. The diphtheria group of the serum laboratory adopted the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods that were successfully tested in 1958—deep cultivation (that is, the method of liquid cultivation of vaccines using closed large containers, introducing sterile air) and tissue culture (that is, the method of culturing viruses using animal tissue cells). Greatly increase the yield and quality of the product. In addition to ensuring the overfulfillment of this year's production plan targets, the employees of the vaccine laboratory also cooperated with the Wuhan Biological Products Institute, providing support in terms of manpower and technology, so as to fully utilize the potential of their equipment and increase output. The small animal laboratory did not cooperate well with other units in the institute last year, and the quantity and specifications of small animals used for production and experiments by other units could not well meet the requirements. In order to improve the work, all employees of the laboratory have decided to adopt methods such as "guinea pig reciprocal mating" to increase breeding, and have put forward many specific measures to strengthen feeding management.

　　In order to effectively improve product quality and increase new varieties, the research projects proposed by each laboratory have increased from fifty-two last year to more than one hundred and thirty. The content of research is more extensive, and the application and research of cutting-edge technologies such as isotopes, ultrasonic waves, and ion exchangers in biological products are proposed. In order to reduce the pain of multiple vaccinations for humans and enable people to prevent multiple diseases after one vaccination, they will study and trial-produce nine new products, and carry out research on the application of traditional Chinese medicine in biological products.

　　In terms of manpower use, the institute has decided to implement administrative cadres participating in production and organize family members to participate in labor to solve the problem of insufficient labor, and continue to carry out technical innovation movements.

　　With the efforts of all employees, the institute has made obvious achievements. As of January 26th, the actual value of output completed increased by 37% compared with the same period last year, the output of vaccinia vaccine increased by 50% compared with the same period last year, the product pass rate increased from 90%-92% in the same period last year to 100%, and the output of placental globulin increased by 54% compared with the same period last year.

### 预制妙药除病　保证顺利跃进  生物制品研究所加紧生产菌苗等药品

    预制妙药除病　保证顺利跃进 
    生物制品研究所加紧生产菌苗等药品
    本报讯　为更好防治疾病，保证工农业生产的更大跃进，卫生部生物制品研究所全体职工，在1958年大跃进的基础上，继续鼓足干劲，要生产更多更好的供预防、诊断和治疗需用的菌苗、疫苗、诊断液和血清、抗菌素等生物制品。他们初步确定今年的产值计划比去年增长80％以上，各种制品的产量将有显著的增加，制品的质量也有很大提高，合格率达99％，成本降低10％，还有四种新的制品大量投入生产。
    该所去年的生产和研究工作，由于全所职工发挥了冲天的干劲，超额完成了计划，基本保证了防疫工作的需要。今年，为了实现更高的生产指标，各单位现正进行总结1958年生产技术革新和研究工作的经验。血清室的白喉组采取1958年试验成功的、土洋结合的办法——深层培养（就是用密闭的大容器，通入无菌空气，进行液体培养菌苗的方法）和组织培养（就是用动物组织细胞培养病毒的方法）。大大提高产品的产量和质量。菌苗室职工除保证超额完成今年本室的生产计划指标以外，还与武汉生物制品研究所协作，在人力和技术等方面给予支援，以充分发挥他们设备的潜力，增加产量，小动物室去年与所内别的单位配合不够好，对其他单位用于生产和试验的小动物，在数量上和规格上，还不能很好满足要求。为了改进工作，全室职工已决定采用“海猪倒公交配”等方法增加繁殖，并提出许多加强饲养管理的具体措施。
    为了有效地提高产品质量，增加新的品种，各室提出的研究项目，由去年的五十二项增加到一百三十项以上。研究的内容更为广泛，提出了同位素、超声波和离子交换剂等尖端技术在生物制品上的应用和研究。为了减少人体多次预防接种的痛苦，使人经过一次接种能预防多种疾病，他们将研究试制九种新制品，并开展中医中药应用于生物制品的研究。
    在人力使用方面，该所决定实行行政干部参加生产，和组织家属参加劳动，以解决劳动力不足的问题，并继续开展技术革新运动。
    该所在全体职工的努力下，已经做出了明显的成绩。1月份截至26日止，实际完成的产值比去年同期增加37％，牛痘苗的产量比去年同期增50％，产品合格率由去年同期的90％—92％提高到100％，胎盘球蛋白产量比去年同期增加54％。
