    Aunt Zhao's Holiday
    Junzhe
    January 11th was the day off for female commune member Aunt Zhao of the Gaokan People's Commune in Shenyang.

    After breakfast, just as the eldest daughter-in-law was taking the child to the nursery, Aunt Zhao said, "It's my day off today, let's keep Furong at home." So the eldest daughter-in-law handed Furong to her grandmother and took her third son, Fuming, to the nursery before going to work.

    Not long ago, old man Zhao Desheng returned from a meeting in the team and happily said to his wife, "This time, old farmers are really going to enjoy good fortune. Not only is food free, but we also get paid monthly wages and have monthly holidays..." Aunt Zhao said in surprise, "Really! That's wonderful."

    Aunt Zhao couldn't stay still at home with her second grandson. She finished tidying up the firewood pile in the yard and fed the five hens. At this time, the big fat pig came out of the pen, and she was busy feeding the pig again. After feeding, she took her second grandson and sat on the warm south kang to play.

    The next day was old man Zhao Desheng's day off. Aunt Zhao had a coughing fit, so she asked the captain for a few more days off and still kept her grandson at home. She asked the old man, "Are you resting today?" Old Zhao said with a smile, "With the commune, our lives are getting better and better. To be honest, I feel itchy inside and out if I don't do some work for a while."

    赵大娘的假日
    俊哲
    1月11日是沈阳高坎人民公社女社员赵老大娘的休假日。
    吃完早饭，大儿媳妇抱着孩子刚往托儿所走，赵老大娘说：“我今天该歇着了，把福荣留家吧。”大儿媳妇就把福荣交给奶奶，把三儿子福明送到托儿所就干活去了。
    不久前，老头赵德生从队里开会回来，高高兴兴地对老伴说：“这回老庄稼人可享福了，不光吃饭不要钱，还月月发工资，还每月放假休息哪……”赵老大娘惊喜地说：“是吗！那可太好了。”
    赵老大娘领着二孙子在家也呆不住，她把院内柴禾垛收拾完了，又把五只老母鸡喂一喂。这时大肥猪由圈里出来了，她又忙着喂猪。喂完了领着二孙子坐在热乎乎的南炕头上玩。
    第二天是老头赵德生休假日。赵老大娘咳嗽病犯了，所以又向队长请了几天假，仍旧把孙子留在家里。她问老头：“你今天歇不？”老赵头笑嘻嘻地说：“有了公社，咱的小日子越过越美，说真个的，有一时不干点活，从心里往外痒痒。”
