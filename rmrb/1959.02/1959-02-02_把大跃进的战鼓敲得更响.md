The Chinese people, having won the great victory of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, are now confidently embracing the new battle tasks for 1959: 18 million tons of steel; 380 million tons of coal; 1,050 billion jin of grain; and 100 million dan of cotton. This new campaign unfolding before us is even greater and more arduous than last year's. After many major industrial and agricultural products developed at a rate of doubling in the previous year, it is unimaginable and fundamentally impossible for any capitalist country to continue to advance at such a high speed. In every respect, our people should strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

1959 is the second year of the three years of hard struggle, and it is also the decisive year. Our Great Leap Forward last year has already achieved brilliant success, but compared with our grand ideals, this is just the beginning. To change our country's "poor and blank" face and build our country into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, we still need to continue our hard struggle. The international environment for our people's socialist construction, the existence of imperialist aggression threats, also requires our people to make the motherland strong as soon as possible. Whether from the domestic or international situation, socialist construction cannot be slow, but must be at a high speed. To achieve high speed, especially in our country with a relatively backward economic base, we must struggle hard. Continuing to struggle hard and continue to rapidly overcome our country's backwardness in economy and culture is in line with the greatest interests of our people in the long term; because only through such a few years of hard struggle can we enjoy the greatest happiness in the near future. Since we want to struggle hard, our labor must be tense. In the process of socialist construction, the necessary and not excessive hard struggle and tension are inevitable and normal. Our hard struggle is a pleasant hard struggle for noble purposes, and our tension is a tension full of hope in the process of advancement. Hard struggle now, tension now, can be exchanged for future happiness and future ease. Without this hard struggle, without this tension, our country will be in a state of poverty and weakness for a long time, and our people will not be able to become rich quickly. In this way, we will fall into another kind of tension: not much food, very little steel, unable to resist natural disasters, and unable to defend against imperialist aggression. This kind of tension is terrible. We are now working hard to build our country, and working hard to build our own and our children's happy life. When we are stronger, and the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is stronger, imperialism will not dare to invade us casually. Hard struggle is not only necessary for the happy life of our people, but also necessary for consolidating and strengthening the entire socialist camp.

Some people think that since we want to combine work and rest, and since we want to "eat well, sleep well, and rest well," we should not struggle hard. This is of course a misunderstanding. In labor production, necessary rest must be paid attention to. However, we are not resting for the sake of resting, but for more effective hard struggle, for a greater leap forward. To completely oppose hard struggle and rest, wanting only rest and not hard struggle, is just as wrong as wanting only hard struggle and not rest. The hard struggle we need is not simply to increase labor intensity. On the contrary, we must pay more attention to mobilizing the masses to carry out technical revolution, improve technology, improve tools, improve operating methods, and improve labor organization in the hard struggle, and strive to improve labor productivity. The development of production is always inseparable from the development of technology. Carrying out technical revolution is the road to hard struggle. We can carry out construction at a high speed by struggling hard on this road.

This year, our people continue to leap forward, and there are sufficient favorable conditions. We have the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the unity and selfless labor of the people of all nationalities across the country, and the assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. These are the most fundamental guarantees for continuing the leap forward. In addition to this, we have many more favorable conditions this year than last year. First, after a year of the Great Leap Forward last year, our material conditions are more solid than in any previous year. Our industrial and agricultural products have greatly increased compared to the past, industrial and agricultural capital construction has greatly increased compared to the past, and production equipment capacity has also greatly increased. Nearly 700 large factories and mines above the limit were put into production in the past year, which is more than 100 more than the large factories and mines above the limit put into production during the first five-year plan. Last year's output of machine tools reached more than 90,000 units, which is more than the total output of machine tools during the first five-year plan. Our steelmaking capacity reached about 20 million tons by the end of last year. Our farmland irrigation area has reached 1 billion mu. Second, after the Great Leap Forward last year, our technical team has greatly expanded, and the technical level has also greatly improved. The same equipment can produce more products, and some advanced, large, and precision products that could not be produced in the past can also be produced. In agriculture, a complete set of "Eight-Character Charter" rich harvest experience has been summarized from the tens of millions of mu of experimental fields and the large-scale high-yield experience in many places. Third, the rural areas across the country have realized the people's commune system, and the characteristics of the people's commune, which is large and public, combining workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, and comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, are not only more conducive to the development of agricultural production, but also to the development of industrial production. Fourth, and more importantly, the great practice of last year has enriched the Party's general line of socialist construction and enriched the production experience of the Party's cadres and the masses of the people. We have the experience of launching mass movements under the centralized leadership of the Party committee, not only on the agricultural front, but also on the industrial front. With the rich experience of 1958, we are more confident of realizing a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959.

However, no matter how favorable the conditions are, to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, we must first give play to people's enthusiasm. People are the most active factor in production. The most sophisticated factory can have low production efficiency in the hands of lazy people; the most fertile good fields still cannot get a bumper harvest when they encounter people with insufficient enthusiasm. Conversely, even if the equipment is relatively old, it can continuously improve efficiency through people's reforms; even if the soil is barren, it can increase harvests through people's painstaking processing and transformation. With the same conditions, different enthusiasm leads to very different achievements. This is proved by countless facts in the Great Leap Forward last year. Now, our people are happily talking about the great agricultural harvest in 1958, but few people talk about the natural disasters in 1958, which were greater than in the past few years. This is because last year, under the leadership of the Party, 500 million farmers exerted soaring enthusiasm and launched a struggle against natural disasters, rescuing more than 300 million mu of cultivated land from the disaster and doubling the output in a large area. Soaring enthusiasm defeated the disaster and achieved a bumper harvest; soaring enthusiasm made the steel production increase, which capitalist countries regard as a dream, a reality. In 1959, we have more favorable conditions, coupled with this soaring enthusiasm, is there anything to doubt about achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward?

Of course, soaring enthusiasm must be combined with the spirit of scientific analysis. To do anything well, the subjective must be consistent with the objective. However, emphasizing the spirit of scientific analysis does not limit soaring enthusiasm; emphasizing respect for objective laws does not belittle people's subjective initiative. Soaring enthusiasm is a decisive factor in developing the revolutionary cause at any time. The proletariat is the gravedigger of the bourgeoisie, and the bourgeoisie's reactionary rule will certainly be overthrown by the proletariat. This is the objective law of social development. However, if the proletariat does not cheer up and does not muster revolutionary enthusiasm, the bourgeoisie will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history. Objective laws are independent of people's subjective will, but once people grasp objective laws, they can limit the side that is unfavorable to society and use the side that is beneficial to society. In the final analysis, people should not be slaves to objective laws, but should master objective laws. People cannot transform objective laws, but they can recognize, grasp, and use objective laws. People's enthusiasm cannot play a role beyond the scope permitted by objective conditions, but it can create conditions that were not originally available and transform unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions to achieve victory. Emphasizing the spirit of scientific analysis is to better发挥发挥人们的主观能动性, and it is by no means to limit people's subjective initiative, let alone cancel it. The reason why we advocate giving full play to the soaring enthusiasm of the people is precisely the conclusion of a scientific analysis of our country's situation. Soaring enthusiasm closely combined with the spirit of scientific analysis is the most important thing in our time.

The four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton in 1959 proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party are indicators that combine soaring enthusiasm and the spirit of scientific analysis. The stipulation of these indicators means that we must achieve a new balance of the national economy with a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. The development of agriculture requires heavy and light industries to provide more industrial products, and the development of industry requires agriculture to provide more raw materials. The breakthrough of steel, coal, grain, and cotton from the old balance requires the indicators of other products to leap up accordingly. The situation of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in our country has been formed, and the development of the situation in the future will still be like this. The task of each department is to adapt to this situation, overcome difficulties in the process of advancement with soaring enthusiasm, and keep up with the advancement of the four major indicators. Only when all production departments follow the leap can the four major indicators be guaranteed. Only by adopting such a positive and balanced approach can we maintain the continuous high-speed advancement of socialist construction.

A greater battle has begun. Heroic sons and daughters of the motherland, continue to muster your enthusiasm, strive for the top, be more, faster, better, and more economical, beat the drums of the Great Leap Forward even louder, and bravely struggle to realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959!

### 把大跃进的战鼓敲得更响

    把大跃进的战鼓敲得更响
    赢得了1958年工农业生产大跃进的伟大胜利的中国人民，正满怀信心地迎接1959年新的战斗任务：钢，一千八百万吨；煤，三亿八千万吨；粮，一万零五百亿斤；棉，一亿担。展开在我们面前的这个新的战役，是一个比去年更伟大、更艰巨的战役。在上一个年度许多工农业主要产品都以一倍的速度发展之后，还要用这样高的速度继续前进，是任何资本主义国家连想也不敢想，并且根本做不到的。不论从哪个方面来说，今年我国人民应该争取一个更大更好更全面的跃进。
    1959年是苦战三年的第二年，也是决定性的一年。我们去年的大跃进已经取得辉煌的成就，但同我们远大的理想比较起来，这不过是刚刚开始。改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌，把我们的国家建设成具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家，还有待于我们继续苦战。我国人民进行社会主义建设的国际环境，帝国主义侵略威胁的存在，也要求我国人民尽快地使祖国强盛起来。无论从国内的和国际的情况来说，社会主义建设不能是慢吞吞的，而必须是高速度的。要高速度，特别是在原来经济基础比较落后的我国，就必须苦战。继续苦战，继续迅速地克服我国在经济上和文化上的落后，是符合于我国人民在长时期内的最大利益的；因为只有通过这样的几年苦战，我们才能在不久的将来享受到最大的幸福。既然要苦战，我们的劳动就不能不紧张起来。在社会主义建设过程中，必需的而不是过分的苦战和紧张是不可免的正常的。我们的苦战是为了崇高的目的愉快的苦战，我们的紧张是充满了希望的前进中的紧张。现在苦战，现在紧张，就能换得将来的幸福，将来的轻松。如果没有这种苦战，没有这种紧张，那末，我们的国家就长期处于贫弱的地位，我们的人民就不能迅速地富裕起来。这样，我们就会陷于另一种紧张：粮食不多，钢铁很少，既不能抵抗自然灾害，又不能防御帝国主义的侵略，这种紧张才是可怕的紧张。我们现在紧张地建设自己的国家，紧张地建设我们自己和我们子孙的幸福生活。当我们更加强大了，以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营更加强大了，帝国主义就不敢随便侵犯我们了。苦战不但是为了我国人民的幸福生活所必需，而且也是巩固和壮大整个社会主义阵营所必需的。
    有人以为，既然要劳逸结合，既然要“吃得好、睡得好、休息得好”，就不该苦战。这当然是误解。在劳动生产中，必须注意必要的休整。但是，我们不是为休整而休整，而是为了更有效的苦战，为了更大的跃进。把苦战和休整完全对立起来，只要休整而不要苦战，正如同只要苦战而不要休整一样，都是不对的。我们所需要的苦战，并不是单纯地要求增强劳动强度，恰恰相反，我们要在苦战中更加注意发动群众开展技术革命，改进技术，改进工具，改进操作方法，改进劳动组织，努力提高劳动生产率。生产的发展总是同技术的发展分不开的。开展技术革命是苦战的道路。我们在这条道路上苦战，就能够高速度地进行建设。
    今年我国人民继续跃进，有充分的有利的条件。我们有以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的正确领导，有全国各族人民的团结一致和忘我劳动，有苏联以及各兄弟国家的援助，这些都是继续跃进的最根本的保证。除此以外，今年我们还有许多比去年更有利的条件。第一，经过去年一年的大跃进，我们的物质条件比过去任何一年更加雄厚了。我们的工农业生产品比过去大大地增加了，工农业的基本建设比过去大大增加了，生产设备能力也大大增加了。去年一年中部分或全部投入生产的限额以上的大厂矿就有近七百个，比第一个五年计划期间投入生产的限额以上的大厂矿还多一百多个。去年一年中的机床产量达九万多台，比第一个五年计划期间机床的总产量还多。我们的炼钢能力，在去年底就达到了二千万吨左右。我们的农田水利灌溉面积已经达到了十亿亩。第二，经过去年的大跃进，我们的技术队伍大大扩大了，技术水平也大大提高了。同样的设备能够生产更多的产品，一些过去不能生产的高级的、大型的、精密的产品，也能开始生产了。在农业方面，从千万亩试验田和许多地方的大面积丰产经验中，已经总结出一整套的“八字宪法”丰产经验。第三，全国农村已经实现了人民公社化，人民公社的又大又公的特点，工农商学兵相互结合，农林牧副渔全面发展，不仅对农业生产的发展，而且对工业生产的发展，更加有利了。第四，更重要的是去年一年的伟大实践，丰富了党的社会主义建设的总路线，丰富了全党干部和人民群众的生产经验。我们有了不仅在农业战线上，而且在工业战线上，在党委集中领导下大搞群众运动的经验。有了1958年的丰富经验，实现1959年更大、更好、更全面的跃进就更有把握了。
    但是，不管条件多么有利，要实现更大、更好、更全面的跃进，首先总要发挥人的干劲。人是生产中最活跃的因素。设备最精良的工厂，在懒洋洋的人的手下，生产效率也可以变低；土壤最肥沃的良田，遇到干劲不足的人，仍然得不到大丰收。反之，设备即今比较陈旧，经过人的改革，就可以不断提高效率；土壤虽然贫瘠，经过人千方百计的加工改造，也可以增加收获。条件相同，干劲不同，得到的成就大不相同。这是去年大跃进中的无数事实可以证明的。现在，我们的人民都在兴高采烈地谈论1958年农业的大丰收，却很少有人谈到1958年的比过去几年都要大的自然灾害。这就是因为去年五亿农民在党的领导下发挥了冲天的干劲，同自然灾害展开了斗争，把三亿多亩耕地从灾情中抢救出来，在大面积的范围内使产量成倍地增长。冲天的干劲，战胜了灾害而得到大丰收；冲天的干劲，使资本主义国家视如梦幻的钢产加番成为现实。1959年我们有了更多的有利条件，再加上这种冲天的干劲，实现更大、更好、更全面的跃进，难道还有什么可以怀疑的吗？
    当然，冲天的干劲要同科学分析的精神相结合。要办好任何事情，主观必须同客观一致。但是强调科学分析的精神，并不限制冲天的干劲；强调尊重客观规律，并不是贬低人的主观能动性。冲天的干劲，在任何时候都是发展革命事业的决定性的因素。无产阶级是资产阶级的掘墓人，资产阶级的反动统治一定会被无产阶级推翻。这是社会发展的客观规律。然而，如果无产阶级不振作起来，不鼓足革命干劲，资产阶级并不会自动地退出历史舞台。客观规律是不以人的主观意志为转移的，但一旦人们掌握了客观规律，却可以限制它不利于社会的一面，利用它有利于社会的一面。归根到底，人不要作客观规律的奴隶，而要驾御客观规律。人不能改造客观规律，但能够认识、掌握和利用客观规律。人的干劲不能超越客观条件所许可的范围发生作用，但却可以创造原来并不具备的条件和把不利的条件转化为有利的条件，去取得胜利。强调科学分析的精神，是为了使冲天的干劲，使人的主观能动性得到更好的发挥，而绝不是限制人们的主观能动性，更不是取消它。我们之所以提倡充分发挥人民群众的冲天干劲，正是对我国情况的科学分析的结论。与科学分析的精神密切结合的冲天干劲，是我们的时代最最重要的。
  党的八届六中全会提出的1959年的钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标，是冲天干劲和科学分析精神相结合的指标。这些指标的规定，意味着我们要以更大更好更全面的跃进来实现国民经济的新的平衡。农业的发展要求重工业和轻工业提供更多的工业产品，工业的发展又要求农业提供更多的原料。钢、煤、粮、棉突破了旧的平衡，要求其他产品的指标相应地跃上去。我国社会主义建设的大跃进的局面已经形成，今后形势的发展仍然是这样。各个部门的任务就是适应这个形势，以冲天的干劲克服前进中的困难，跟上四大指标前进。只有各个生产部门跟着跃上去，四大指标才有保证。只有采取这样的积极的平衡的方针，我们才能保持社会主义建设的不断的高速度的前进。
    一场更伟大的战斗开始了。祖国的英雄儿女们，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省，把大跃进的战鼓敲得更响，为实现1959年更大、更好、更全面的跃进英勇奋斗吧！
