　　Brief News Items

　　Printed Xiangyun Silk
　　The Shanghai State-owned No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory successfully trial-produced printed Xiangyun silk.
　　Xiangyun silk is a special tanned fabric from Guangdong. It is dyed with a plant called "Liang," and is not afraid of sun or water washing. The fabric is smooth, the surface is glossy, and it is easy to wash and dry, making it suitable for summer clothing. However, in the past, Xiangyun silk generally only had a few colors such as plain black and reddish-brown.

　　Making Sugar from Lotus Root Residue
　　Staff members of the Shishan People's Commune Commercial Section in Echeng County, Hubei, have made maltose from lotus root residue. About ten catties of maltose can be extracted from a hundred catties of raw lotus root residue after it has been used to make powder, and the quality of the sugar is very good. The lotus root residue after making sugar can still be used to feed pigs.

　　Making Insulation Powder from Waste Alkali Residue
　　The Tianjin Asbestos Factory recently successfully trial-produced insulation powder using waste alkali residue. This powder can replace calcium carbonate in the production of asbestos powder. This not only turns waste into treasure, but also saves calcium carbonate for other industrial production.

　　Frying Dough Sticks with Water-Oil Mixture
　　A unit of the Railway Corps of the People's Liberation Army successfully trial-fried dough sticks with a water-oil mixture. The method is as follows: first put an equal amount of water as oil into the pot and boil it, then pour the oil into the pot. When the oil bubbles fill the edge of the pot and then disappear, start frying the dough sticks. Using this method, only about seven catties of oil are needed to fry sixty catties of dough sticks, while originally fourteen or fifteen catties of oil were needed. According to experiments, this method is also suitable for frying tofu balls and other fried foods.

　　Electrification of Vegetable Cutting and Meat Grinding
　　The staff of the Laotongcheng Restaurant in Hankou made great technical innovations and successfully installed four production tools using a combination of indigenous and modern methods: electric grinding, electric meat grinding, electric noodle making, and electric vegetable cutting, greatly improving production efficiency. For example, in the past, using a hand-cranked meat grinder could only grind ten catties of meat per hour, but after switching to electric power, it can grind sixty catties per hour, increasing production efficiency five times. After the noodle cutting machine was converted to electric power, efficiency increased by three and a half times.

    印花香云纱
    上海国营第一印染厂试制印花香云纱成功。
    香云纱是广东特产的拷胶衣料。它是用一种叫“莨”的植物来染色，不怕日晒、水洗。布身爽滑，布面光泽，洗晒方便，适宜制夏季衣着，素受国内外欢迎。但是过去香云纱一般只有元色和棕红色等少数色泽。
    用藕渣熬糖
    湖北鄂城县石山公社商业股职工，用藕渣熬出了饴糖。一百斤原藕经制粉后所得的残渣，可以熬饴糖十来斤，糖的质量很好。熬糖后的藕渣仍可喂猪。
    废碱渣制保温粉
    天津市石棉厂最近利用废碱渣试制成功保温粉。这种粉可以代替碳酸钙，生产石棉粉。这样不但变废物为有用，而且还可以省下碳酸钙，供其他工业生产用。
    水油混合炸油条
    人民解放军铁道兵某部试用水油混合炸油条成功。作法是：先将和油同等数量的水放入锅内煮沸，然后倒油下锅，等到油泡充满锅沿再消失时，就开始炸油条。用这种方法，炸六十斤面的油条，只用油七斤左右，而原来却要用十四、五斤油。据试验，这种方法还适用于炸豆腐丸子等油炸食品。
    切菜绞肉电气化
    汉口老通成餐馆的职工们大闹技术革新，以土洋结合的方法，装制成功电动磨浆、电动绞肉、电动制面、电动切菜等四种生产工具，大大提高了生产效率。如过去用手摇绞肉机绞肉，每小时只能绞十斤肉，改成电动后，每小时可绞六十斤，提高了生产效率五倍。切面机改成电动后，效率提高了三倍半。
