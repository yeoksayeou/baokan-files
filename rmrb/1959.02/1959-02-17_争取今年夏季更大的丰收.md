    Strive for a Greater Harvest This Summer
    Tan Zhenlin
    Spring is coming, everything is renewed, and the busy farming season of the new year has begun. After a year of hard work and achieving unprecedented great victories, the nation's farmers have taken a short rest and are now embarking on a new battle. An agricultural production upsurge, even larger in scale than in 1958, is about to rapidly sweep the country. Leading agencies at all levels on the agricultural front are adjusting their work arrangements, concentrating their efforts on the primary objective of achieving a greater harvest this summer, fighting the first battle well to ensure the over-fulfillment of the year's agricultural production increase targets.
                          I
    The production targets for steel, coal, grain, and cotton for 1959 proposed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and the resolution on certain questions concerning people's communes passed at that session, have greatly inspired the entire Party and the people of the whole country. Through a series of meetings such as Party congresses and three-level cadre meetings, Party committees at all levels have formulated comprehensive plans and made specific arrangements for this year's industrial and agricultural production targets. Through the in-depth dissemination of the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party and the rectification of the people's communes, the broad masses of farmers are feeling even more cheerful and are even more motivated. The National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Units put forward ten initiatives for striving for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959. At present, the nation's farmers are working hard with confidence to overfulfill this year's agricultural production increase targets.
    The central task on the agricultural production front at present is to seize the first season and strive for a greater harvest this summer. This is the first hurdle in winning the overall victory for the year, and it is also the key to ensuring a great harvest this year. The great harvest of 1958 began with a great summer harvest, which played a decisive role in the overall great harvest of the year. Last year's summer harvest saw the continuous emergence of high-yield records of several thousand catties per mu in wheat experimental fields, which directly promoted the great harvest of early rice and early autumn crops, and also had an extremely favorable impact on the great harvest of late rice and late autumn crops. Everyone remembers this vividly. Because this year's grain production task is even greater than last year's, striving for a greater summer harvest this year will also be of greater significance than last year. Summer grain crops are mainly wheat; if the per-unit area yield of wheat is increased to four hundred catties or six hundred catties, then the 350 million mu of winter wheat can yield 140 billion to 210 billion catties. In this way, for the 350 million people in China whose staple foods are wheat and coarse grains, in addition to leaving enough seeds and supplying the industrial grain and non-staple food grain for cities, it is entirely possible to make wheat flour account for a large proportion of the entire ration. In addition, it may be possible to set aside a certain amount of wheat as reserve grain. If we add the planned sowing of 50 million mu of spring wheat, which can also achieve the same per-unit area yield as winter wheat, then our lives will be even better. For the South, striving for an early rice harvest has the same significance. The planned sowing area for early rice nationwide is about 150 million mu; if the per-unit area yield is increased to 1,000 to 1,500 catties, then 150 billion to 225 billion catties can be harvested. If we do a good job in the first season, it is possible to achieve a total output of 290 billion to 435 billion catties of summer grain and early rice. Adding the approximately 70 million mu of barley, naked barley, broad beans, peas, and potatoes, it may be possible to approach or exceed the total grain output of 1957, and mainly fine grains. This means that if we do a good job in the first season, it is possible to solve the year's ration problem; at the same time, it will inevitably greatly boost morale and promote a greater harvest in the fall. Therefore, doing a good job in the first season can put us in an invincible position in completing this year's agricultural production increase tasks. Only with a summer harvest, with the appearance of large-scale high-yield production, can we talk about reducing the area sown for summer and autumn crops, and further implement the policy of sowing less to achieve high yields and more harvests.
                               II
    The agricultural production tasks for 1959 are still very arduous. Grain production must be increased to 1,050 billion catties, an increase of 40% over last year; ginned cotton must be increased to 100 million dan, an increase of nearly 50% over last year. That is, grain must be increased by 300 billion catties, and ginned cotton must be increased by 33 million dan. From the perspective of per-unit area yield, because the grain sowing area has been reduced to about 1.6 billion mu, the average yield per mu must reach 660 catties; the cotton sowing area is planned to be expanded by more than 10 million mu, reaching a total of 100 million mu, and the average ginned cotton per mu must also reach 100 catties. It should also be noted that this is a national average figure. If we take into account the possible disaster losses, the limitations of natural conditions, and the uneven development of work, then the area with grain crops yielding over 1,000 catties per mu this year must increase from a few percent of the sown area last year to about 50%, and ginned cotton must have a considerable area reaching over 150 catties per mu in order to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's agricultural production increase tasks.
    The arduousness of the 1959 agricultural production tasks is also manifested in the tension of rural labor. This year not only requires a large increase in grain and cotton production, but also requires a great revolution in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, as well as the great development of commune-run industries. Agriculture itself must also develop more economic crops, especially oilseeds, hemp, and sugar crops. The increase in oilseed production should double the amount of edible vegetable oil compared to last year, reaching at least six million tons. Hemp production should reach 20 million dan. Otherwise, it will not be able to meet the needs of industrial raw materials, the needs of urban people for non-staple foods, and the needs of improving the lives of the people throughout the country. In order to develop these aspects of production, it is necessary to extract the necessary labor from grain and cotton production. Therefore, the production tasks borne by each laborer this year are much larger than in 1958. The labor productivity of the entire agricultural production front must be greatly improved in order to meet the requirements of this year's greater leap forward.
    We must also estimate the possible natural disasters. In 1958, the area affected by floods and droughts was about 400 million mu. After a tenacious struggle against drought and planting and a struggle to prevent floods and drain waterlogging, there were still 100 million mu that suffered disasters. Last year, the total cultivated area in China was only over 1.6 billion mu, and the affected area reached 400 million mu, and the disaster area reached 100 million mu. Of course, this is not a trivial matter, and it would have been a year of poor harvest in previous years. It was only because of the great leap forward in agricultural production that the people's lives were not seriously affected by the disaster. How will the weather conditions be in 1959? It is still difficult to predict. At present, signs of drought have already emerged. Some places have not had rain or snow for seven months, and there has not been enough snow in the north. The winter temperature in many places is also unstable. It is not impossible for a drought or flood disaster of the same or even greater magnitude than last year to occur this year, which must arouse our sufficient vigilance.
    All of the above shows that this year's agricultural production tasks are more arduous than in 1958. Failing to see this arduousness, thinking that the grain and cotton targets have not even doubled, that it is not a great leap forward, that there is nothing remarkable about it, that there is no need to continue to exert great effort and strive for excellence, that there is no need to use the set of methods that proved effective last year, these ideas are extremely harmful. This is often the ideological manifestation of those who have always lacked drive, but are good at empty talk. If this kind of thinking is not seriously overcome, it may relax the masses' fighting spirit, affect the masses' enthusiasm, and hinder the continued leap forward in our agricultural production.
    Comrade Mao Zedong often taught us to learn to look at problems comprehensively, to be good at distinguishing the main aspects and secondary aspects of things, and to be good at grasping the main and most essential things. When we analyze the situation of agricultural production this year, we must estimate the above-mentioned difficulties. It is completely wrong not to pay attention to this aspect and not to seriously deal with these difficulties. But we must realize that these difficulties can be overcome. From a global perspective, the situation is more favorable than in 1958. The great leap forward in 1958 has laid the foundation for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. This is the main aspect of the problem and the most fundamental characteristic of the current situation.
    What are the main and favorable conditions for agricultural production this year?
    First of all, the awareness of the broad masses has been raised, and their enthusiasm is even greater. Through the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958 and the realization of the people's communes, the victory of the struggle between the two roads has been further consolidated economically and organizationally, thereby greatly raising the awareness of the masses. Of course, there are still a very small number of people who still miss the capitalist road, and they are still fighting against us. But in a sense, this kind of struggle is beneficial to helping the masses raise their vigilance, raise their awareness, and correct the shortcomings and errors in their work, and plays the role of a "negative teacher." After overcoming the obstacle of right-leaning conservative thinking on the issue of construction speed more thoroughly in 1958, the Chinese farmers have found the law of high-speed development of agricultural production, which has further liberated their thinking and caused a major change in their spiritual outlook. They have never been so full of confidence in conquering nature and rapidly developing production as they are now. The focus of the current struggle is still mainly against right-leaning conservative thinking, and this task is long-term; but the result of the struggle will always be to further raise the awareness of the masses and boost the enthusiasm of the masses. In 1958, the people's communes were realized throughout the country. The people's communes further linked the fate of the 500 million farmers with the socialist collective. The people's communes implemented the system of eating without money and collective welfare, and cut off the tail of private ownership of the means of production, which not only made the living standards of farmers universally improved, eating more, eating better, and eating more happily than in the past, but more importantly, it relieved them of the heavy burden of worrying about food and drink that had been weighing on their shoulders for many years, greatly improving their collective awareness and concentrating all their energy on collective production. The farmers said, "With the people's communes, there is an iron rice bowl. But if we don't do a good job in production, the iron rice bowl will not be secure." All of the above will inevitably further stimulate the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses.
    Secondly, the people's communes will undoubtedly play a greater role in the greater leap forward in 1959 than they did last year. As soon as the people's communes were established last year, they immediately plunged into the tense three-autumn campaign and the nationwide steelmaking campaign. Without the people's communes, it would have been unthinkable to complete such arduous tasks. At that time, the people's communes had just been set up and had not had time to be rectified and consolidated, but they had already shown their power. After the rectification and improvement this past winter and spring, it is entirely certain that it will play an even greater advantage in this year's great leap forward in agricultural production. From the perspective of fertilizers and tools urgently needed for agricultural production, when the state is not yet able to supply them in large quantities, the development of commune-run industries can meet the requirements of agricultural production for indigenous fertilizers and can realize the semi-mechanization of agriculture. The development of commune-run industries and diversified management will greatly improve the commodity production rate of the communes, making the people's commune economy active and strong, not only ensuring that wages are paid on a monthly basis, but also having the strength to expand reproduction. Due to the further improvement of labor organization by the people's communes, the implementation of collectivized life, the gradual realization of semi-mechanization, the further play of the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and the liberation of women from household labor, turning them from the so-called semi-labor force in the past into a main force on the agricultural production front, this will greatly unleash labor potential and double labor productivity.
    Third, the policy of sowing less to achieve high yields and more harvests and the eight measures for increasing production have been established among the masses after a year of practice and struggle. This is a major event related to the high-speed development of agricultural production in China. Although the national grain output doubled last year, the role played by the eight measures was only just beginning to show. Last year, because the various measures were gradually increased as people's understanding gradually developed, it was impossible to implement them comprehensively and accurately, especially to combine them with each other; even if some measures were accurately identified, it was impossible to do them well in the same year or to receive benefits in the same year. For example, deep plowing was only implemented in very few places in the first half of last year. In terms of water conservancy construction, the achievements were particularly significant last year, but due to seasonal restrictions, or the failure to build channels and level the land, many of the projects will only receive the benefits they deserve this year. Last year's summer harvest crops were generally not densely planted, and the degree of dense planting of autumn harvest crops was also very uneven. In terms of fertilizer, there was a lot of topdressing, but the base fertilizer was generally insufficient. This year's situation is different. About 60% of the winter wheat sown last winter has been deeply plowed, of which about 10% has been deeply plowed to more than 1.5 feet; the amount of sowing is generally about 30 catties per mu, which is double that of the previous year; the base fertilizer for wheat fields is generally over 10,000 catties, which is two or three times more than in previous years, and several topdressings have also been carried out, also over 10,000 catties; good varieties have been widely used; the irrigation area has doubled compared to last year; and most areas have organized professional teams from the beginning to carry out field management. Because of such hard work, this year's wheat seedlings are generally dense, even, and good. It seems that it is not impossible to strive for a yield of over 1,000 catties per mu. The people's understanding and application of the eight measures has changed from unsystematic to systematic, from incomplete to comprehensive, and from unconscious to conscious. This is a fundamental change in nature. As we become more proficient in mastering and applying it, its power will inevitably become greater and greater.
    Fourth, in the great leap forward in 1958, leading agencies at all levels gained rich experience. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Party made a systematic summary of these experiences, further arming the cadres and improving their leadership level. This will play an inestimable role in this year's greater leap forward in agricultural production. The methods created in last year's practice, such as cadres participating in physical labor, planting experimental fields, using production to lead production, on-site meetings, inspection and evaluation, red flag competitions, the slogan of ten-point indicators, twelve-point measures, and twenty-four-point enthusiasm, and one upsurge after another, have been proven to be effective leadership methods for developing China's agricultural production quickly, well, and economically. The broad masses of the people are satisfied with these leadership methods. They say, "Wherever the Party points, we will fight there." This profoundly reflects that the relationship between the Party and the masses is closer. In last year's production movement, our cadres showed unparalleled revolutionary enthusiasm and displayed the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, which is extremely valuable. Although individual comrades got a little hot-headed around the time of the autumn harvest and some exaggerated phenomena occurred, they have been promptly corrected. This makes us more based to overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, thereby maximizing the development of China's agricultural production; at the same time, it can avoid the blindness caused by exceeding objective reality, thereby further closely integrating revolutionary enthusiasm and scientific spirit. The enthusiasm we speak of includes both revolutionary enthusiasm and scientific spirit; it includes both the initiative of hard work and the creativity of skillful work. With hard work, skillful work can be produced; with the combination of hard work and skillful work, hard work can be sustained, and skillful work can be developed. Last year, the energy of our leaders at all levels was mainly focused on stimulating the masses' spirit of hard work, which was correct. Because when the masses have not been fully mobilized, unilaterally emphasizing skillful work will instead bind the hands and feet of the masses. However, the situation this year is different. There is no doubt that on the basis of the masses having been fully mobilized, we will definitely be able to lead the masses to be both brave in hard work and good at skillful work, closely combine the two, and create more and better working methods to achieve even greater victories.
    The above favorable conditions are the basis for the inevitable realization of a greater leap forward in agricultural production this year. This is very clear to the vast majority of our comrades. Therefore, they have great confidence and great enthusiasm. They are leading the broad masses of farmers, holding high the red flag and beating drums and gongs, to plunge into the battle of the new year.
    But it should be seen that there are still some people who, like doubting the great leap forward last year, are also skeptical about the great leap forward this year. Because their method of looking at problems is not correct, they cannot see the above-mentioned favorable conditions, they cannot smell the fresh breath in the development of things, they are very easy to accept the influence spread by the "tide-watching faction" and the "accounting faction," so they have little enthusiasm and little confidence. If the ideological problems of these comrades are not resolved quickly, it will delay the opportunity and be extremely unfavorable to this year's great leap forward.
    As for the "tide-watching faction" and the "accounting faction" in the movement, they are not a problem of thinking methods, but a problem of standpoint. Standing on the standpoint of a small number of wealthy farmers, they take advantage of the opportunity of the agricultural front to recuperate and summarize experience to spread erroneous opinions, saying that "there is no flour to eat even if the wheat is harvested, and sweet potatoes are still eaten even if grain production increases, and the great leap forward is unreliable," etc., in an attempt to create chaos. Of course, their statement cannot deceive the masses. Taking wheat as an example, it increased by more than 30 billion catties compared to the previous year, that is, an increase of more than two-thirds, which is of course a very huge leap forward. However, because dense planting was generally promoted this year, the amount of seed used has greatly increased, and simply leaving seeds (including reserve seeds) is more than double that of last year, accounting for about half of the increased portion. The remaining portion is distributed to people in wheat-eating areas, averaging only about 40 catties more per person than in the previous year. Because of the wheat harvest, both rural and urban areas ate more white flour for a period of time, so although the wheat was harvested, the supply of flour is still felt to be insufficient. To supply it sufficiently, we must strive for a greater increase. There is nothing strange about this. The sweet potatoes harvested last year accounted for a quarter of the total grain output, and some concentrated production areas accounted for more than half. Although potatoes are not as good as fine grains as staple foods, they are much better than the situation in many places in the past where there was insufficient grain. To increase the proportion of fine grains and reduce the proportion of potatoes in the food, we must leave more fine grains as seeds, and we must temporarily eat more sweet potatoes. Eating more sweet potatoes now is precisely for the purpose of eating more fine grains in the future. The masses all know that the weather last year was not favorable. On the contrary, many places were drought years that had not been encountered in decades. It was only because of the great leap forward that the disaster was greatly reduced, not only not affecting the lives of the masses, but also improving their lives. Just pointing this out can show how absurd the "great leap forward is unreliable" said by the tide-watching faction is. The tide-watching faction also wants to use the fact that some places overestimated production last year to deny the achievements of the great leap forward, which is equally absurd. It is inevitable that there is a distance between estimated production and actual production. Some are too high, and some are too low. The situation last year was generally more underestimated than overestimated. Using the situation of a few overestimates to deny last year's great leap forward, this error is very obvious and will never gain the sympathy of the broad masses. On the contrary, the broad masses will use even greater revolutionary enthusiasm and this year's greater achievements to give these tide-watching factions a double blow!
    The key to determining the overall situation is to fight the first battle well, to strive for a greater harvest this summer. According to this year's plan, the average yield per mu of wheat should reach 400 catties or 600 catties. Therefore, we must strive for 50% of the wheat fields to yield over 1,000 catties per mu to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of this plan. This requires the main wheat-producing areas to strive for the target of 1,000 catties per mu. Rape seeds and spring-sown crops must also strive for large-scale high-yield production.
    The foundation for this year's winter wheat has been laid. The key lies in the next five months. If we continue to work hard to carry out strict field management, topdress and water in a timely manner, and seize the key points of greening, jointing, flowering, heading, and grain filling, so that each mu can have 400,000 to 600,000 ears and each ear can have about 35 grains of wheat, it is entirely possible to achieve a yield of 1,000 catties per mu.
    To strive for a greater harvest this summer, the main key at present is to ensure the topdressing of overwintering crops and the base fertilizer of spring-sown crops. We must implement the fertilizer "commander" according to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, and launch a movement in which everyone participates and everyone accumulates fertilizer. Last year's experience has proved that there are many sources of fertilizer. As long as we follow the instructions of the Central Committee, vigorously accumulate human and animal manure, smoked fertilizer, fermented fertilizer, and develop indigenous fertilizers, increase green manure, it is entirely possible to apply tens of thousands of catties of fertilizer per mu. While carrying out the fertilizer accumulation movement, we must consider how to get a large amount of fertilizer to the ground in time according to the needs of the crops. This requires attention to improving the quality of fertilizer, improving the methods of accumulating, making, and transporting fertilizer, developing more indigenous fertilizers, and promoting field accumulation of fertilizer to ensure that crops are fed and watered. At present, the national fertilizer accumulation movement has been launched vigorously. Many places have proposed to seize fertilizer with the same effort as developing iron and steel, which is completely correct, and everyone should do so.
    Strengthen the field management of wheat fields and other overwintering crops. Treat every wheat field and rape and other crops like a mother cares for her baby. Let her eat when she should eat, drink when she should drink, be full, be well-fed, prevent diseases if there are no diseases, and treat diseases in time. In order to do this, professional teams must be established quickly if they have not been established, so that every field and every furrow has a dedicated person responsible from sowing to harvesting to strive for high yields and good harvests in every field. Spring-sown crops should also be treated in the same way from sowing to harvesting, and they should be planted even better than wheat, achieving universal deep plowing, sufficient base fertilizer, the use of improved varieties, and rational dense planting. In addition to preparing fertilizer at present, we must vigorously seize the deep plowing of land, which is the central link to ensuring a good harvest of spring-sown crops, and cannot be relaxed in the slightest. At the same time, the technical specifications for spring sowing should also be formulated as early as possible according to local conditions and submitted to the masses for discussion to ensure that sowing is timely and well done.
    According to the agricultural production targets for 1959 and the existing labor force in rural areas, labor productivity must be doubled this year to ensure the realization of all targets. The existing labor force in China's rural areas is equivalent to about 220 million full-time laborers. According to preliminary estimates, less than 40% can be used for grain production in addition to those used for economic materials, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, industry, transportation, basic construction, and life services. That is to say, only 80 million laborers will be responsible for the production of more than 1,000 billion catties of grain this year, so it is necessary to greatly improve labor productivity. There are many ways to improve labor productivity. It is not possible to have a large increase in agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers this year, so the main way out is to rationally arrange labor, improve labor organization, improve labor management, and improve cultivation techniques. There is still much to be done in these areas. The most important way out lies in the large-scale reform of tools. The mass movement of tool reform must be closely combined with professional manufacturing; the effective improved tools must be quickly finalized and vigorously promoted; this year's tool reform plan must be formulated according to the production plan and labor plan, and this movement must be systematically carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. The current focus should be on seizing transportation tools, deep plowing tools, and water lifting tools in conjunction with the fertilizer accumulation movement and spring plowing work, and preparing harvesting and threshing tools for the summer harvest as soon as possible.
    The Central Committee has issued a mobilization order to carry out the spring production movement centered on fertilizer accumulation, and we are facing an extremely glorious and arduous battle. Cadres at all levels in rural areas across the country should organize this battle to strive for a summer harvest with the same confidence in victory, seriousness, and meticulousness as the commanders of our People's Liberation Army organize a campaign. First of all, conduct a general inspection of spring plowing preparation and the management of overwintering crops, go deep into every production team and professional team, go deep into every wheat field and spring field, and see if the targets are advanced? Are the measures keeping up? If the targets are not enough, add more; if the measures are not enough, quickly add measures. Conduct a wheat seedling line-up to eliminate third-class seedlings and eliminate pests and diseases within a time limit. Conduct a general inspection of the various tools needed for spring, repair what should be repaired, and add what should be added. Help each production team to make production arrangements and life arrangements. In particular, the difficulties in the lives of the masses in areas with poor harvests and units with reduced production should be solved practically and seriously. When carrying out the above work, it is necessary to carry out sufficient political and ideological work at the same time to ensure that every combat unit has vigorous morale and full enthusiasm.
    Let competitions unfold in all parts of the country and in every commune, to see who holds the red flag higher. Let us present a victory greater than last summer's harvest as the first gift from the agricultural front to the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland!

    争取今年夏季更大的丰收
    谭震林
    春季来临，万象更新，新的一年的农忙季节已经开始了。全国农民经过了一年的苦战，取得了史无前例的伟大胜利之后，进行了短期的休整，又开始投入了新的战斗。一个比1958年规模更大的农业生产高潮即将迅速普及全国。农业战线上的各级领导机关，正在调整工作部署，把力量集中到争取今年夏季更大丰收的主攻方向来，打好第一仗，以保证超额完成全年的农业增产任务。
                          一
    党的八届六中全会所提出的1959年的钢、煤、粮、棉的生产指标和通过的关于人民公社若干问题的决议，大大地鼓舞了全党和全国人民。各级党委经过党代表大会、三级干部会等一系列的会议，对今年的工农业生产指标，制定了全面规划，作出了具体部署。经过对党的六中全会决议的深入宣传和对人民公社的整顿工作，广大农民心情更加舒畅，干劲鼓得更足。全国农业先进单位代表会议提出了为争取1959年更大、更好、更全面跃进的十大倡议。目前全国农民正满怀信心地为超额完成今年的农业增产指标而进行着紧张的劳动。
    当前农业生产战线上的中心任务是抓紧第一季，争取今年夏季来个更大的丰收。这是夺取全年胜利的第一关，也是保证今年大丰收的关键。1958年的大丰收是从夏季大丰收开始的，它曾经对全年大丰收起了决定的作用。去年夏收中，小麦试验田亩产几千斤的高产纪录连续出现，直接推动了早稻和早秋作物的大丰收，对晚稻和晚秋作物的大丰收也起了极为有利的影响。这一点，大家都是记忆犹新的。由于今年的粮食生产的任务比去年更大，争取今年来个更大的夏季丰收，也将比去年具有更大的意义。夏粮作物以小麦为主；如果小麦的单位面积产量提高到四百斤或六百斤，那么，三亿五千万亩冬小麦就能够收到一千四百亿斤到二千一百亿斤。这样，在我国以小麦和杂粮为主食地区的三亿五千多万人口，除了留下足够的种子和供应城市的工业用粮、副食用粮外，就完全可能使面食在整个口粮中占到很大的比重。此外，还可能留出一定数量的小麦作为储备粮。如果加上计划播种的五千万亩春麦，也能得到同冬小麦一样的单位面积产量，那么，我们的日子就更好过了。对南方来说，争取早稻丰收，也有同样的意义。全国计划播种早稻的面积约一亿五千万亩，如果单位面积产量提高到一千到一千五百斤，就可以收到一千五百亿到二千二百五十亿斤。我们抓好了第一季，就有可能使夏粮和早稻的总产量达到二千九百亿到四千三百五十亿斤。加上约七千万亩大麦、元麦、蚕豆、豌豆和薯类，就有可能接近或超过1957年的粮食总产量，而且主要是细粮。这就是说，抓好了第一季，就有可能解决全年的口粮问题；同时也必然会大大振奋人心，鼓舞士气，推动秋季的更大丰收。所以，抓好了第一季，就可以使我们对于完成今年的农业增产任务立于不败之地。也只有夏季丰收了，大面积的高额丰产出现了，我们才谈得到减少夏种和秋种面积，进一步来贯彻少种高产多收的方针。
                               二
    1959年的农业生产任务，仍然是很艰巨的。粮食要增产到一万零五百亿斤，比去年增加40％；皮棉要增产到一亿担，比去年增加近50％。即粮食要增加三千亿斤，皮棉要增加三千三百万担。从单位面积产量来看，由于粮食播种面积缩小到十六亿亩左右，平均每亩产量必须达到六百六十斤；棉花播种面积计划扩大一千多万亩，共达一亿亩，平均每亩皮棉也要达到一百斤。还应该看到，这是一个全国平均的数字。如果把可能发生的灾害损失、自然条件的限制和工作发展不平衡等因素估计进去，那么，今年粮食作物亩产千斤以上的面积，就必须从去年占播种面积的百分之几增加到50％左右，皮棉就必须有相当大的面积达到亩产一百五十斤以上，才能保证完成和超额完成今年的农业增产任务。
    1959年农业生产任务的艰巨性还表现在农村劳动力的紧张上。今年不但要求粮棉大增产，而且要求农林牧副渔全线大革命和社办工业的大发展。农业本身也必须发展更多的经济作物，特别是油料、麻类和糖料。油料的增产，应当使食用植物油比去年增加一倍，至少达到六百万吨。麻类的产量应当达到二千万担。否则就不能满足工业原料的需要，不能适应城市人民副食品的需要和全国人民生活提高的需要。而为了发展这些方面的生产，就不能不从粮、棉生产方面抽出必要的劳动力。因此，每个劳动力今年所负担的生产任务，比1958年要大得多。整个农业生产战线上的劳动生产率，必须大大提高，才能适应今年更大跃进的要求。
    我们还必须估计到可能发生的自然灾害。1958年遭受水旱灾害的面积约四亿亩，经过顽强的抗旱抢种斗争和防洪排涝斗争之后，仍然有一亿亩成灾。去年我国全部耕地面积不过十六亿多亩，受灾面积达到四亿亩，成灾面积达到了一亿亩，当然不是一件小事，在往年就成歉年了。由于农业生产的大跃进，才没有使人们的生活受到灾害的重大影响。1959年的天时条件如何，现在还难于预料。目前旱象已经露头，有的地方七个月没有下过雨雪，北方的雪也下得不足，许多地方冬季的气温也不稳定。今年出现一个和去年同样的甚至更大的水旱灾害，不是没有可能的，这必须引起我们足够的警惕。
    以上这些都说明，今年的农业生产任务比1958年更加艰巨。看不到这种艰巨性，以为粮棉指标都没有翻一番，就不是大跃进，就没有什么了不起，就可以不要再鼓足干劲、力争上游，不要再苦战了，就可以不必运用去年曾经行之有效的一套办法了，这些想法是极端有害的。这往往是那些素来干劲就不足，但又善于空谈的人们的思想表现。这种思想如果不认真加以克服，就有可能松懈群众的斗志，影响群众的干劲，妨碍我们农业生产的继续跃进。
    毛泽东同志经常教导我们，要学会全面看问题，要善于区别事物的主要方面和次要方面，要善于抓住主要的和最本质的东西。在我们分析今年农业生产所处的形势的时候，必须估计到上述的困难。不注意到这一面，不认真去对待这些困难，是完全错误的。但是我们必须认识，这些困难都是可以克服的。从全局来说，形势比1958年更为有利。1958年的大跃进已经为今年打下了更大、更好、更全面跃进的基础。这是问题的主要方面，是当前形势的最根本的特点。
    今年的农业生产有些什么主要的和有利的条件呢？
    首先是广大群众的觉悟更高了，干劲更足了。经过1958年农业生产的大跃进和人民公社化的实现，从经济上和组织上进一步巩固了两条道路斗争的胜利，从而大大提高了群众觉悟。当然还有极少数的人仍然留恋着资本主义的道路，他们还在跟我们进行着斗争。但是从某种意义上说来，这种斗争对于帮助群众提高警惕，提高觉悟，纠正工作中的缺点和错误，都是有利的，是起着“反面教员”的作用。经过1958年比较彻底地在建设速度问题上克服了右倾保守思想的障碍，我国农民摸到了高速度发展农业生产的规律，这就进一步地解放了他们的思想，引起了他们的精神面貌的重大变化。他们从来没有像现在这样充满征服自然、迅速发展生产的信心。当前斗争的锋芒主要还是反对右倾保守思想，而且这个任务是长期的；但是斗争的结果总是会进一步地提高群众觉悟，鼓舞群众的干劲。1958年全国实现了人民公社化，人民公社使五亿农民把他们自己的命运进一步地跟社会主义的集体联系在一起了。人民公社实行了吃饭不要钱和集体福利的制度，割掉了生产资料私有制的尾巴，不仅使农民的生活水平有了普遍提高，比过去吃得饱，吃得好，吃得痛快，更重要的是使他们放下了多少年来压在肩上的愁吃愁喝的千斤重担，大大提高了集体主义的觉悟，把全部精力集中到集体生产上来了。农民们说：“有了人民公社就有了铁饭碗。但是不搞好生产，铁饭碗就保不牢。”所有以上这些，必然进一步激发起广大群众的积极性和创造性。
    其次，人民公社对于1959年的更大跃进，无疑将会发挥出比去年更加巨大的作用。去年人民公社一经建立，就立即投入了紧张的三秋运动和全民炼钢运动。没有人民公社，要完成那样繁重的任务是不能设想的。那时人民公社还刚刚搭起架子，还没有来得及进行整顿巩固，就显示出了它的威力。在经过去冬今春的整顿提高以后，它在今年农业生产的大跃进中将发挥其更大的优越性，是完全可以肯定的。从农业生产所迫切需要的肥料和工具来说，在国家还不可能大量供应的时候，社办工业的发展就可以满足农业生产对于土化肥的要求，就可以实现农业的半机械化。社办工业和多种经营的发展，就会大大提高公社的商品生产率，使人民公社经济活跃，腰杆子硬起来，不但能保证按月发工资，而且有力量来扩大再生产了。由于人民公社对劳动组织的进一步改善，生活集体化的实行，半机械化的逐步实现，群众积极性和创造性的进一步发挥，以及妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，由过去所谓半劳动力变成一支农业生产战线上的主力军，这都会大大发挥劳动潜力，成倍地提高劳动生产率。
    第三，少种高产多收的方针和增产的八项措施，经过去年一年的实践和斗争，已经在群众中确立下来了。这是关系我国农业生产高速发展的一件大事。去年虽然全国粮食产量增加了一倍，但是从八项措施所发挥的作用来说，还仅仅是初露锋芒。在去年，由于各项措施是随着人们认识过程的逐步发展而逐步增加上去的，不可能贯彻得很全面，很准确，尤其不可能作到互相结合；有些措施即使是看准了，但也不可能在当年就作好，或者在当年就能收到效益。例如深翻土地，去年上半年只有很少地方实行。在水利建设方面，去年成绩特别显著，但是所做的工程由于季节的限制，或渠道未及修筑、土地未及平整，不少要在今年才能收到应有的效益。去年的夏收作物一般没有密植，秋收作物密植的程度也很不平衡。肥料方面，追肥不少，但是基肥一般不足。今年的情况就不同了。去冬播种的小麦约有60％经过深翻，其中约有10％深翻到一尺五寸以上；播种量一般每亩都在三十斤左右，比前年增加了一倍；麦田基肥一般都在万斤以上，比往年增加了两三倍，并进行了几次追肥，也在万斤以上；普遍使用了良种；灌溉面积比去年扩大了一倍；而且大部分地区一开始就组织了专业队来进行田间管理。由于下了这样大的苦功夫，所以今年一般麦苗长的又密、又匀、又好，看来争取亩产千斤以上，并不是不可能的。人们对于八项措施的认识和运用，从不系统到系统，从不全面到全面，从不自觉到自觉，这是一个根本性质的变化。随着我们对于它掌握运用的熟练程度，它的威力必然越来越大。
    第四，在1958年的大跃进中，各级领导机关都取得了丰富的经验。党的六中全会对这些经验作了系统的总结，进一步武装了干部，提高了他们的领导水平。这对于今年农业生产的更大跃进，将起着不可估量的作用。在去年的实践中所创造的干部参加体力劳动，种试验田，以生产领导生产，现场会议，检查评比，红旗竞赛，十分指标、十二分措施、二十四分干劲的口号，一个高潮接一个高潮等等方法，已被证明是多快好省地发展我国农业生产的行之有效的领导方法。广大群众对这些领导方法是满意的，他们说：“党指到那里，我们就打到那里。”这深刻地反映了党和群众的关系更加密切了。在去年的生产运动中，我们的干部表现了无比的革命热情，发挥了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，这是极为宝贵的。虽然有个别同志在秋收前后头脑有些发热，发生了某些浮夸现象，但是已经受到了及时的纠正。这就使我们更有根据地来克服右倾保守思想，从而最大限度地发展我国的农业生产；同时又可以避免因超越客观实际而产生的盲目性，从而把革命热情和科学精神进一步地密切结合起来。我们说的鼓足干劲，既包括了革命热情，又包括了科学精神；既包括了苦干的积极性，又包括了巧干的创造性。有了苦干才能产生巧干；有了苦干和巧干相结合，苦干才能持久，巧干才能发展。去年我们各级领导的精力主要放在激发群众的苦干精神方面，这是正确的。因为在群众还没有充分发动起来的时候，片面地强调巧干，就反而会束缚群众的手脚。但是，今年的情况已经不同了。毫无疑问，在群众已经充分发动的基础上，我们一定能够领导群众既勇于苦干又善于巧干，把二者密切地结合起来，创造出更多更好的工作方法，以取得更加巨大的胜利。
    以上这些有利条件，就是今年农业生产必然能够实现更大跃进的根据。这对于我们绝大多数同志说来，都是很清楚的。因此他们信心很大，干劲很足。他们正在领导广大的农民群众，高举红旗、锣鼓喧天地投入新的一年的战斗。
    但是应该看到，现在也还有一些这样的人，跟怀疑去年的大跃进一样，对今年的大跃进也抱着怀疑态度。他们由于看问题的方法不对头，看不到上面这些有利条件，嗅不到事物发展中的新鲜气息，极易接受观潮派和算账派所散布的影响，因而干劲不大，信心不足。这些同志的思想问题如果不迅速解决，就会贻误时机，对今年的大跃进极为不利。
    至于运动中的观潮派和算账派，他们不是什么思想方法问题，而是立场问题。他们站在少数富裕农民的立场，利用农业战线进行休整、总结经验的时机，散布错误意见，说什么
  “小麦丰收了没有面吃，粮食增产了还要吃甘薯，大跃进靠不住”等等，企图制造混乱。他们的这种说法，当然是蒙蔽不了群众的。拿小麦来说，去年比前年增产了三百多亿斤，即增产三分之二以上，这当然是非常巨大的跃进。但是由于今年普遍推广密植，用种量大大增加，光留种子（包括预备种子）就比去年多留一倍多，占去了增产部分的一半左右。其余部分分给吃麦地区的人，平均每人不过比前年多得四十斤左右。由于小麦丰收，农村和城市有一个时期都多吃了一些白面，因此小麦虽然丰收了，面粉的供应目前仍然感觉不充足，要供应充足，还必须争取更大的增产。这丝毫没有什么奇怪的地方，去年收获的甘薯，占粮食总产量的四分之一，有些集中产地占到一半以上。薯类作主食虽然不如细粮，但是比过去许多地方粮食不足的情况却好多了。要在吃粮中提高细粮的比重而减低薯类的比重，就不能不多留一些细粮作种子，也就不能不暂时多吃一些甘薯。现在多吃一些甘薯，正是为了将来多吃细粮。群众都知道，去年并不是风调雨顺的，相反，许多地方还是几十年未遇的旱灾年。只是由于大跃进，才大大缩小了灾情，不但没有影响群众的生活，而且使生活有了改善。仅仅指出这一点，就可以说明观潮派所说的“大跃进靠不住”是多么荒唐了。观潮派还想利用去年有些地方估产偏高的事实来否认大跃进的成绩，这也是同样地荒谬。估产和实产之间通常是不免有距离的，有的偏高，有的偏低，去年的情况一般是偏低多于偏高。利用少数估产偏高的情况来否定去年的大跃进，这种错误是很明显的，是决不会得到广大群众的同情的。相反，广大群众将以更大的革命热情，用今年更大的成就来给这些观潮派以加倍的打击！三
    决定全局的是打好第一仗，是争取今年夏季更大丰收。根据今年计划，小麦的平均每亩产量应当达到四百斤或六百斤。因此，必须争取50％左右的麦田亩产千斤以上，才能保证这个计划的完成和超额完成。这就要求主要产麦区必须为亩产千斤的指标而奋斗。油菜籽和春播作物，也必须力争大面积高额丰产。
    今年冬小麦的基础已经打好了，关键在于今后五个月。如果我们再接再厉地进行严密的田间管理，及时追肥、浇水，抓住返青、拔节、扬花、抽穗、灌浆几个主要关键，使每亩能有四十万到六十万穗，每穗能有三十五个左右的麦粒，就完全可以达到亩产千斤。
    争取今年夏季更大的丰收，当前的主要关键是保证越冬作物的追肥和春播作物的基肥。必须根据中共中央和国务院的指示，实行肥料“挂帅”，开展一个人人动手、大家积肥的运动。去年的经验证明，肥料来源是很多的，只要按照中央指示，大力积攒人畜粪便，熏肥、沤肥，大搞土化肥，增产绿肥，每亩地施上几万斤肥料是完全可以办到的。在开展积肥运动的同时，必须考虑到如何把大量的肥料根据作物需要及时地上到地里。这就要注意到提高肥料质量，改善积肥、造肥、运肥的方法，多搞土化肥，推广田头积肥，以确实保证农作物吃饱喝足。目前，全国的积肥运动已经轰轰烈烈开展起来了，许多地方提出了以大搞钢铁的劲头来大抓肥料，这是完全正确的，大家都应当这样做。
    加强麦田和其他越冬作物的田间管理对每一块麦田和油菜等作物，都要像母亲抚育婴儿一样，让她该吃就吃，该喝就喝，吃得饱，喝得足，没病防病，有病及时治疗。为了做到这些，没有建立专业队的，必须迅速建立，做到每一块、每一垅，从种到收，都有专人负责，以争取亩亩高产，块块丰收。春播作物从种到收也应该如此，应当比小麦种得更好，做到普遍深耕，施足底肥，使用良种，合理密植。当前除了准备肥料以外，必须大力抓深翻土地，这是保证春播作物获得丰收的中心一环，丝毫也不能放松。同时，对春播的技术规格，也要因地制宜地及早制定出来，并提交群众讨论，保证种得及时，种得好。
    根据1959年农业生产指标和农村现有劳动力的计算，今年必须把劳动生产率提高一倍，才能保证全部指标的实现。我国农村现有劳动力折合成为全劳动力约有二亿二千万个。据初步估计，除用于经济用物、林牧副渔、工业交通、基本建设、生活服务等方面以外，能用于粮食生产的不到40％。也就是说，今年只有八千万个劳动力来担负一万多亿斤粮食的生产任务，因此，非大大提高劳动生产率不可。提高劳动生产率的方法是多方面的。农业机械和化学肥料，今年还不可能有大量的增加，因此主要的出路是合理安排劳力，改善劳动组织，改善劳动管理，改进耕作技术。这些方面都还大有文章可做。而最主要的出路还在于大搞工具改革。必须把工具改革的群众运动和专业制造密切结合起来；必须把行之有效的改良工具迅速定型，大力推广；必须根据生产计划和劳动规划定出今年的工具改革方案，有计划有步骤地把这个运动系统地开展起来。当前的重点应该是结合积肥运动和春耕工作，大抓运输工具、深耕工具和提水工具，同时及早把夏收的收割、脱粒工具准备好。
    中央已经发出了开展以积肥为中心的春季生产运动的动员令，我们正面临着一场极其光荣而艰巨的战斗。全国农村各级干部，都应该像我们人民解放军的指挥员组织一个战役一样，充满必胜的信心，而又严肃认真、谨慎周密地来组织这场争取夏季丰收的战斗。首先要对春耕准备和越冬作物的管理进行普遍检查，深入到每一个生产队和专业队，深入到每一块麦田和春地，看一看指标订得是否先进？措施是否跟得上去？指标不够的要加码，措施不够的赶快加措施。进行麦苗排队，限期消灭三类苗和扑灭病虫害。对春季需用的各种工具都要普遍进行检查，该修补的修补，该添置的添置。要帮助每个生产队作好生产部署和生活安排，特别对于歉收地区和减产单位的群众的生活困难，要切实认真地予以解决。在进行以上这些工作的时候，都必须同时进行充分的政治思想工作，保证每一个战斗单位都有旺盛的士气和饱满的热情。
    让全国各地各公社展开竞赛，看谁把红旗举得更高吧。让我们把一个比去年夏季丰收更大的胜利，来作为农业战线向我们伟大祖国国庆十周年的第一个献礼！
