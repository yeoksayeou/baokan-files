Unquenchable Flames
Deputy Imam of Oman Talks About the Struggle of the Omani People

The fighting Omani people are an unyielding and heroic people. The flames of resistance against British colonialism that they have raised in southeastern Arabia have been burning for three years, and this struggle has become an important part of the Arab people's movement to win national independence and oppose colonialism. How are the Omani people resolutely and wholeheartedly opposing the colonialists who are pressing down on them? The representative of the Omani people on a friendly visit to our country, Prince Harsey, Deputy Imam of Oman, introduced this issue to the reporter on February 8.

Two months ago, when Prince Harsey met with a Xinhua News Agency reporter in Damascus, he spoke of the madness and frustration of British colonialists. He said that the victories achieved by Omani nationalists had put Britain in a state of madness and confusion, and that Britain had concentrated 100,000 soldiers and 1,000 aircraft in Oman and southern Arabia alone. He also cited an example, saying that British colonialists bombed the Green Mountain area constantly from morning till night every day, dropping 20 bombs on a shirt hanging on a tree, and 25 bombs on a donkey, thinking they were fighters. This time, Prince Harsey also introduced that in Oman, such things happened, if someone was spotted by a plane, no matter if there was only one person, the plane would chase after them; if they ran into the forest, it would follow and circle over the forest to search; if they hid in the mountains, it would fly over the mountainous area until it killed them or couldn't find them. The Prince said: "British colonialists are not willing to let go of a single Omani, but it also shows that they are afraid of every Omani."

What is it that makes the colonialists so troubled? Prince Harsey introduced that in the Green Mountain area of Oman, there are now 20,000 armed people who are widely engaged in guerrilla activities. They flexibly use tactics of luring the enemy deep and ambushing to eliminate the enemy, and arm themselves with captured guns and cannons. In addition, the 80,000 Omani people around the Green Mountain, who are also unable to endure the oppression of the colonialists, have taken up traditional Arab weapons such as waist knives and bravely and cleverly fought back against the enemy's incursions. Prince Harsey told two battle stories. Because British colonial troops often suffered in the mountains, they recently dared not easily enter the mountains again, and had to rely on long-range artillery set up on the plains to bombard the positions of the insurgent people. In January of this year, the insurgent people took the initiative to attack from the mountains. They used roundabout tactics, penetrated deep behind enemy lines, and suddenly surrounded an enemy artillery position on the plain south of the Green Mountain. They bravely engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat, and as a result, captured a heavy artillery piece and killed fifteen British soldiers. Another time, more than a dozen British soldiers attempted to come to a place called Yingmutuo to harass and search whether the people there were hiding weapons. The people there, knowing the news in advance, quickly hid their belongings, and then took their guns and ambushed on the high ground outside the village. After the enemy entered the village, they opened fire together, not letting a single enemy soldier escape alive.

In order to turn Oman, which faces the Arabian Sea, into their base of aggression, and in order to control the rich oil resources there, the colonialists dispatched batches of aircraft to wantonly bomb Omani villages and towns, and used artillery to carry out bloody suppression of the insurgent people. Even unarmed women and children were not spared. In Oman, many kind residents were forced to flee into the mountains because British colonial troops destroyed their homes. They slept in the wild, without clothes or bedding, covering themselves with leaves and bark. Even so, they refused to yield.

Prince Harsey also talked about two things to show how inhumane and cruel the atrocities of British colonialists were. In a place called Tanuf, lived an old man who was deaf and blind. One day a team of British soldiers came to search. Because the old man could not hear or see clearly, he simply did not answer the British soldiers' questions. The British soldiers shot him to death, and also broke into his home and robbed things. People who believe in Islam regard mosques as sacred places, but near Nizwa, the capital of Oman, British soldiers unscrupulously broke into mosques, disturbed women who were praying, and forced them to take off all their clothes with guns, so they could be insulted.

While narrating the atrocities of the colonialists, Prince Harsey gave me a pictorial they brought, saying, "From this you can see what the British colonialists have done in Oman." One of the photos in the pictorial shows the scene of a garden, but on the lush ground lies a bomb that has not exploded, weighing more than a ton. The text on the bomb indicates that it is a new British product from 1958. There is also such a photo, the picture shows the scene of an entire village that has been bombed into ruins. The text next to the photo reads: "The British carried out destruction and massacre here, and not a single stone in this village has not been turned over."

After narrating the atrocities of the colonialists, Prince Harsey said: "Under the British offensive, some Omanis lost their parents, some lost their children, and some lost their homes; Britain wantonly infringes on their sovereignty, freedom, and independence, which makes the Omani people unite and unanimously oppose the enemy." Still on that pictorial that Prince Harsey gave me, I saw the image of the Omani people unanimously opposing the enemy. There is a photo in the pictorial of two soldiers guarding two British-employed spies. Among the two soldiers, one is an old man with a white turban and a long shirt, with a large beard and a bit of a hunchback, and the other is a young man wearing shorts and barefoot, with some childishness on his face. The appearance of these two, old and young, is so different, but they both hold a rifle each, firmly guarding their common post. This fact declares: The entire Oman is in battle.

In the two-hour interview, the reporter asked Prince Harsey to talk about the prospects of the Omani people's struggle. Prince Harsey's attitude had been solemn and calm during the conversation, but at this time he waved his hands and said in a decisive voice: "Although British colonialists possess modern weapons of various kinds, both light and heavy, and although our material conditions are very poor, we have confidence, we have a firm will, and we will never lay down our arms unless the struggle achieves final victory." After saying the above last sentence, he particularly repeated: "We will never lay down our arms." The Prince continued: "The Chinese people, under the leadership of their leader, carried out the War of Resistance Against Japan and achieved victory. Similarly, the Omani people believe in their Imam and persist in the struggle to defend their country and for the independence and freedom of their country."

Just as Prince Harsey said during his visit to Beijing, the Omani people are in the midst of a storm. But the imperialists cannot extinguish the flames of the Omani people's struggle, and their struggle has won the support and sympathy of peace-loving people all over the world. Under the strong east wind, the flames of their struggle will burn higher and higher. As long as the struggle persists, the Omani people will one day surely burn the heinous colonialism to ashes on their own land.

    扑不灭的火焰
    阿曼副教长谈阿曼人民的斗争
    新华社记者  汪波清
    战斗着的阿曼人民是不屈的英勇的人民，他们在阿拉伯半岛东南部举起的反对英国殖民主义的烽火，已经燃烧了三个年头，这一斗争已成了阿拉伯人民争取民族独立、反对殖民主义运动的一个重要组成部分。阿曼人民怎样全力而坚定地反对压在他们头上的殖民主义者？来我国进行友好访问的阿曼人民的代表——阿曼副教长哈尔塞亲王，在2月8日就这一问题向记者作了介绍。
    两个月以前，哈尔塞亲王在大马士革接见新华社记者的时候，他曾谈到英国殖民主义者的疯狂和沮丧。他说，阿曼民族主义者取得的胜利，使英国处于疯狂和混乱的状态，英国仅在阿曼和阿拉伯南部就集中了十万名士兵和一千架飞机。他还举例说，英国殖民主义者曾经每天从早到晚不断轰炸绿山地区，他们竟向挂在树上的衬衣投了二十颗炸弹，向一头驴子投了二十五颗炸弹，以为它们是战士。这次哈尔塞亲王又介绍说，在阿曼竟发生了这样的事情，如果有人被飞机发现，不管就是只有一个人，飞机也要追着不放；跑进树林，它跟着到树林上空盘旋搜索，躲进山，它跟着飞到山区上空，直到打死他或者找不到他为止。这位亲王说：“英国殖民主义者不肯放过一个阿曼人，但是也说明他们害怕每一个阿曼人。”
    是什么使得殖民主义者这样大伤脑筋呢？哈尔塞亲王介绍说，在阿曼的绿山地区，现在有两万名武装人民广泛展开游击活动，他们灵活地运用诱敌深入和伏击的战术消灭敌人，并且用缴获的枪炮武装起自己。另外在绿山周围的八万阿曼人民，也不堪忍受殖民主义者的压迫，拿起阿拉伯人传统的腰刀等武器，英勇机智地回击敌人的进犯。哈尔塞亲王讲了两个战斗故事。英国殖民主义军队因为常常在山区吃苦头，最近他们再不敢轻易入山，只好依靠设置在平原上的远射程炮来轰击起义人民的阵地。今年1月间，起义人民由山区主动出击，他们用迂回的办法，深入敌后，突然包围了绿山南部平原上敌人的一处炮兵阵地，勇敢地和敌人展开白刃战，结果缴获了一门重炮，杀死了十五个英国兵。又有一次，十多个英国兵企图来到一个名叫应木托的地方侵扰，搜查那里的人民是否藏着武器，那里的人们事前知道消息以后，很快隐藏了财物，然后拿了枪埋伏在村外的高地上，等敌人进村后，他们一齐开了火，没有让一个敌兵活着跑出去。
    殖民主义者为了把面临着阿拉伯海的阿曼变成他们的侵略基地，为了控制那里丰富的石油资源，他们出动成批飞机滥肆轰炸阿曼的村镇，并且用大炮对起义人民进行血腥的镇压，就连手无寸铁的妇女和儿童也不能幸免。在阿曼，许多善良的居民因为英国殖民主义军队破坏了他们的家园，被逼逃到深山，他们露宿野外，没有衣被，身上披盖着树叶和树皮。就是这样，他们也不肯屈服。
    哈尔塞亲王还谈了这样两件事，说明英国殖民主义者的暴行残无人道到何种程度。在一个叫塔努弗的地方，居住着一个眼昏耳聋的老人，有一天一队英国兵来搜查，这个老人因为听不清也看不见，只是没有答对英国兵的问话，英国兵便开枪打死了他，还窜到他的家里抢走了东西。信仰伊斯兰教的人把清真寺看做是圣洁的地方，可是在阿曼首都尼兹瓦附近，英国兵竟肆无忌惮地闯进清真寺，扰乱正在礼拜的妇女，并且用枪逼着要她们统统脱光衣服，供他们侮辱。
    哈尔塞亲王在叙述殖民主义者的暴行的时候，他送给我一本他们带来的画报，他说：“从这上面可以看到英国殖民主义者在阿曼干了些什么。”画报上有一幅照片照的是一个花园的情景，可是就在林木葱郁的地上，却横躺着一枚未能爆炸的炸弹，炸弹重一吨以上，弹身上的文字标明它是英国1958年的新产品。还有这样一幅照片，照片的画面是整整一个村庄已炸成废墟的景象。照片旁边的文字写道：“英国人在这里进行了毁坏与屠杀，这村中没有一块石头没被翻动”。
    哈尔塞亲王叙述了殖民主义者的暴行后说：“在英国人的进攻下，阿曼人有的失去父母，有的失去子女，有的失去家园；英国横蛮地侵犯他们的主权、自由和独立，这样就使得阿曼人团结起来，一致对敌。”还是在哈尔塞亲王送给我的那本画报上，我看到了阿曼人民一致对敌的形象。画报上有一幅两个战士看守抓到的两个英国雇用的特务的照片，在那两个战士中，一个是头缠白纱身穿长衫的老者，他长着一把大胡须，背有点驼，另一个则是穿着短裤打着赤脚的小伙子，脸上还带几分稚气，这一老一少的外相是那样不同，但是他们却同样地每人手持一支步枪，坚守在共同的岗位上。这个事实在宣告：整个阿曼在战斗中。
    在两个多小时的访问中，记者请哈尔塞亲王谈谈阿曼人民斗争的前景，哈尔塞亲王在谈话中态度一直庄严沉静，这时他挥动两手，用斩钉截铁般的声音说道：“尽管英国殖民主义者拥有现代化的各种轻重武器，尽管我们的物质条件很坏，可是我们有信心，我们有坚定的意志，如果斗争不获得最后胜利，我们决不放下武器。”他说过上述最后一句话以后，还特别重复说道：“我们决不放下武器。”这位亲王继续说道：“中国人民在自己的领袖领导下进行了抗日战争，并且取得了胜利，同样，阿曼人民相信自己的教长，为了保卫祖国，为了祖国的独立、自由而坚持进行斗争。”
    正像哈尔塞亲王在访问北京期间说的那样，阿曼人民正处在暴风雨中。但是帝国主义者是无法熄灭阿曼人民斗争的火焰的，他们的斗争已得到全世界爱好和平人民的支持和同情。在东风劲吹之下，他们的斗争火焰将愈烧愈高，只要斗争坚持下去，阿曼人民总有一天，定将把万恶的殖民主义在自己的国土上烧为灰烬。
