    Wuhan, February 9th (This newspaper) – Hubei Province is fully promoting the experience of the Great Leap Forward of 1958, seizing the initiative early and effectively. Currently, the vast number of farmers throughout the province, while vigorously engaging in manure accumulation to prepare "grain" for the crops, are enthusiastically carrying out spring plowing preparations in order to lay the foundation for an even greater leap forward in 1959.

    In many areas of Hubei Province, spring planting preparations began as early as the end of last year. Since the launch of the manure accumulation and fertilizer production movement, the progress of spring planting preparations in the province has been even faster, with some areas already forming a high tide. At present, the magnificent manure accumulation movement is developing in depth, and the labor force of more than 2.4 million people across the province, after more than two months of intense battle, has accumulated more than 15 billion dan of natural and miscellaneous fertilizers. At the same time, water conservancy construction and deep plowing of land are also being carried out vigorously. By the end of January, about 50% of the planned quantity had been completed. In particular, the scale of deep plowing is unprecedented in history. Of the more than 24 million mu of winter fallow land in the province, more than 15 million mu have been deeply plowed and finely cultivated. The depth is generally around one chi (about 1/3 meter), and the shallowest is also five or six cun (about 1/6 meter). Jianli and Guanghua counties, which are at the forefront of the movement, have already started water storage and conservation activities, and the fields prepared for use as seedling fields and for planting early rice have been filled with water. Xiaogan County, one of the famous high-yield rice counties in the country, and Wuchang, Hanchuan, Echeng and other counties, in order to strive for a greater rice harvest this year, have already started preparing seedling fields ahead of schedule. In addition, activities such as repairing farm tools, raising draft cattle, and drying seeds are also being stepped up in various places. Some areas have also held training classes on agricultural machinery, crop cultivation, and plant protection, training a large number of technical forces for skillful cultivation, high yield, and abundant harvest.

    At present, various localities are further mobilizing the masses and vigorously conducting inspections and competitions, so that the spring planting preparation work can be done more solidly and meticulously. According to reports from various localities, during the general inspection, many areas have adopted the method of going to each team, inspecting everything, clearing up everything, and verifying and registering, to conduct a comprehensive inspection of fertilizers, deep plowing, farm tools, seeds, and draft cattle.

    In order to better organize the high tide of spring planting preparations, Hubei Province has also drawn on the experience of organizing the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and transferred a large number of cadres to communes and production teams to strengthen leadership at the forefront. Mianyang, Luotian and other counties, while transferring cadres to lower levels, also launched "six togethers," "five haves," and "three staff" competitions among cadres. The six togethers are: eating together, living together, working together, discussing together, entertaining together, and learning together with the masses; the five haves are: having a labor manual, having production tools, having experimental fields, having experimental canteens, and having key points; the three staff are: propagandists, technicians, and cooks. In this way, the transformation of cadres' work style has been further promoted, and the rapid development of spring planting preparation work has been promoted.

    湖北推广去年经验  备耕又早又快又细
    本报武汉9日电　湖北省充分发扬1958年大跃进的经验，抓早抓好，力争主动，目前，全省广大农民在大搞积肥为庄稼准备“粮”的同时，正热情洋溢地进行春耕准备，以便为1959年更大跃进打下基础。
    湖北省许多地区的备耕工作早在去年年底就开始了。积肥造肥运动开展以后，这个省的备耕工作进展更快，有些地区已经形成高潮。目前，气势磅礴的积肥运动正深入发展，全省二百四十多万人组成的劳动大军，经过两个多月的紧张战斗，已积下了自然肥料、杂肥达一百五十多亿担。同时，兴修水利和深翻土地，也搞得热火朝天。到元月底止，已完成计划数量的50％左右。特别是深翻土地，其规模之大是历史上没有的。全省二千四百多万亩冬闲田，经过深耕细整的已有一千五百多万亩。深度一般都在一尺左右，最浅的也有五、六寸。走在运动最前头的监利，光化等县，已经开始进行蓄水保水活动，准备用来作秧田和种植早稻的田，都已灌满了水。著名全国的水稻高产县之一的孝感县和武昌、汉川、鄂城等县，为了争取今年水稻更大丰收，已经提早动手整理秧田。此外，各地整修农具，饲养耕牛，翻晒种籽等活动，也都正在加紧进行。有些地区还举办了农业机械、作物栽培、植物保护等训练班，为精工培育、高产多收训练了大批技术力量。
    目前，各地正进一步发动群众，大搞检查、竞赛，从而使备耕工作做得更扎实、更细致。根据各地反映的情况看，由于在大检查时，许多地区采取了队队走到，样样检查，件件清理，核实登记的办法，对肥料、深耕、农具、种籽、耕牛等进行全面检查。
    为了更好地组织备耕高潮，湖北省还根据组织1958年大跃进的经验，抽调了大批干部下放到公社、生产队，加强第一线的领导。沔阳、罗田等县在抽调干部下放的同时，还在干部中开展了“六同”、“五有”、“三员”竞赛。六同即与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量、同娱乐、同学习；五有即有劳动手册、有生产工具、有试验田、有试验食堂、有重点；三员即宣传员、技术员、炊事员。这样一来，进一步促进了干部作风的转变，推动了备耕工作的迅速开展。
