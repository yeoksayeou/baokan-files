    The Work of a District Committee
    —An Interview with Begov, Secretary of the Proletarian District Committee of the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow
    By Chen Quanbi, Our Correspondent
    Speaking of the Proletarian District of Moscow, Chinese youth must feel particularly close: more than a year ago, during those unforgettable days of the Sixth World Youth Festival, the masses of this district warmly received the Chinese youth delegation.
    The Proletarian District is one of the larger of Moscow's twenty districts. It is called the Proletarian District because there are particularly many workers and factories are concentrated here. The district has nearly a hundred modern enterprises, including the famous Moscow Likhachev Automobile Factory and the Dynamo Electric Motor Factory.
    One snowy morning, we visited Comrade Begov, the secretary of the district committee, who received us in his office. Begov is a warm, straightforward, and very talkative man in his forties. He used to be a spinner, a soldier, a workshop director, and worked in Party mass work. Five years ago, when he was transferred to this district, he was the secretary of the Communist Youth League of the Moscow Oblast and the city of Moscow.

  Grasp the Basic Links in Economic Leadership
    We first asked Comrade Begov to talk about the district committee's experience in leading economic work. He smiled and very modestly told us that he couldn't talk about experience, but he had gained a little understanding in the leadership of economic work over the past few years. He believes that economic work is a very complex and multi-faceted task, but as long as the basic links are grasped, the entire economic work can be driven forward, and the partial can promote the overall. Begov said that in leading economic work, he first grasped the production plan. Whether the production plan is completed or not is the key to testing the success or failure of the district committee's leadership of production. However, completing the production plan should not only satisfy the completion of the output and value of production plan, but should also require the completion of all aspects of the production plan, so as to truly achieve comprehensive, rhythmic, and balanced production. The second is to grasp the issue of improving labor productivity. Begov said that improving labor productivity mainly depends on promoting automation and mechanization, that is, widely setting up automated operation lines, updating equipment, and installing conveyor belts in various factories. As long as the work of automation and mechanization is done well, then on the basis of a factory, it is equivalent to establishing several new factories. He believes that grasping the reduction of production costs and the improvement of product quality is also very important in economic leadership. This mainly depends on extensively mobilizing the masses, therefore, vigorously supporting the rationalization movement of production and the technical innovation movement of various enterprises is one of the most important and frequent tasks of the district committee. Begov said that strengthening the political work of factories and enterprises is also a very important issue. If the political work of the workshop section is not done well, the workers' enthusiasm for labor and their initiative in production cannot be fully developed, then any talk of completing the production plan, improving labor productivity, and reducing production costs is empty talk. Begov said that in economic leadership, in addition to grasping key and comprehensive issues, he also often grasped small and partial issues, because if these issues are not discovered and resolved in time, they will affect the comprehensive development of economic work.

  Ideological Work Has Been Significantly Strengthened
    After a short break, our topic shifted to the district committee's leadership in ideological work. Begov told us that the Party's ideological work has been significantly strengthened in recent years, which is mainly reflected in the improvement of the ideological level of Party members, the improvement of the Party's cadre learning system, and the improvement of the quality of mass propaganda work. He said, if you want to know the degree of importance the district committee attaches to ideological work, you only need to look at the division of labor of the district committee secretary. The first secretary of the district committee, in addition to being responsible for the overall work, is also in charge of ideological work, the second secretary is responsible for organizational work, and the third secretary is responsible for the economy.
    Begov patiently introduced us to the current situation of the district committee's ideological work. He said that the entire ideological work is divided into three parts: first, the study of current affairs policies and theory within the Party; second, daily mass propaganda work; and third, leadership over school education. He said that there has been great progress in all aspects in recent years, especially in the study of current affairs policies and theory. The spirit of persistence in learning by general cadres has been greatly enhanced compared to the past. The learning system and learning organization have also been greatly improved compared to the past. The study style of solving practical problems through theoretical study and linking theory with practice has also become widespread within the Party. In terms of mass propaganda work, although there is no change in the system compared to the past, it is now emphasized that leaders should do it themselves, and the propaganda methods should be closely linked to the ideological reality of the masses and the reality of communist construction, and the propaganda should be diverse in form and lively in content. There are now nearly two thousand propagandists and two hundred reporters in the district, who, according to the instructions of the district committee and the grassroots Party organizations, carry out propaganda work to the masses once or twice a week. In terms of school education, the main task at present is to focus on education reform. Of the thirty-eight middle schools in the district, eighteen will be converted to eight-year schools after this summer vacation. After this summer vacation, a large number of young students will go to various factories and enterprises to work, and doing a good job in the political and ideological work of this group of young people is also a very important task.
    Begov believes that the Soviet Union has now entered a new period of ideological construction. All aspects of the cause of communist construction must have tremendous development, therefore, the entire ideological work must also develop in adaptation to this situation. The most important task of ideological work at present is to conduct comprehensive communist education for all Soviet people, that is, to raise the level of understanding of the state, work, and life of all Soviet people to the level of communism; to cultivate every worker into an active builder of communism and cultivate new people of communism. Begov said that the communist labor team movement that is currently being carried out among the working people of the entire Soviet Union is actually a great beginning of the Soviet people's self-education movement.
    Begov said that 1959 is an extremely heavy year for ideological work. At the Party Congress convened by the district committee not long ago, the representatives unanimously demanded that ideological work must be taken as the focus of work this year, and the strength must be allocated to it. According to the current preliminary plan, the following issues will be resolved in a planned manner within this year: further strengthen the political and ideological education of Party members, the labor education and communist education of youth, vigorously promote atheism and science, promote advanced learning experiences, and promote the inevitable victory of socialism in the peaceful economic competition between the two systems.

  Promote the Leninist Style of Work
    Finally, we asked Comrade Begov to introduce the changes in the lives of grassroots Party members in recent years. Begov said that the changes are of course very large, and all of this is concentrated in the more thorough implementation of the Party's resolutions, the improvement of the level of various Party work, and the closer relationship between the Party and the masses. Begov believes that the most significant change in Party life in recent years is the great promotion of the Party's Leninist style of work. The so-called Leninist style of work is to obey the truth, adhere to principles, care for the masses, and greatly promote the Party's democratic life, on the basis of which the Party's unity and the Party's will are more consolidated and unified. Now, any major issue cannot be decided individually, but must be resolved on the basis of democratic centralism. Begov believes that any experience from an individual is after all partial and narrow, while the experience from the majority is comprehensive and complete. The Party's leadership methods have also changed greatly in the past three years. In the past, the leading cadres of the district committee spent most of their time in the office, drafting official documents and various resolutions, and in frequent meetings. In the past, there were at least three or four meetings a week, and each meeting lasted seven or eight hours, sometimes the whole day. Because there were many meetings, the leading cadres could not spare enough time to go down to the grassroots level. Over time, they could not figure out the situation at the bottom, and it became difficult to guide the work. Now, there is only one meeting a week, and the duration of each meeting must not exceed five hours. In drafting official documents and resolutions, it is now required to be clear and concise, and the number of words should be reduced to the minimum limit. Now, the district committee secretaries can spend almost seventeen or eighteen days a month going down to the grassroots level, and one day a week is used to specifically receive the masses. The relationship between the Party and the masses has also become closer. Taking this discussion on the outline of the report on the Seven-Year Plan as an example, the masses have put forward a total of several thousand opinions in the discussion for almost two months, and the masses' concern for the interests of the country has deepened.
    The visit to Comrade Begov has enabled us to further understand the work of the grassroots Party committees in the Soviet Union. The Proletarian District of Moscow is one of the thousands of grassroots district committees of the Soviet Communist Party. From the work of this district, we can see a glimpse of the work of the national grassroots district committees. From the district committee secretaries of this district, we can also see the vigorous and energetic working style of the staff of the national grassroots organizations. (Attached picture)

### 一个区委的工作——访苏共莫斯科无产阶级区区委书记别戈夫

    一个区委的工作
    ——访苏共莫斯科无产阶级区区委书记别戈夫
    本报记者　陈泉璧
    谈起莫斯科无产阶级区，我们中国青年一定会感到格外亲切：一年多以前，在第六届世界青年联欢节的那些难忘的日子里，这个区的群众曾热情地接待过中国青年代表团。
    无产阶级区是莫斯科二十个区中比较大的一个区。它之所以被称为无产阶级区，是因为这个区的工人特别多，工厂很集中。这个区拥有近百个现代化的企业，有名的莫斯科利哈乔夫汽车厂、狄纳莫电动机工厂都在这里。
    在一个大雪纷飞的上午，我们访问了这个区的区委书记别戈夫同志，他在办公室里接见了我们。别戈夫是一位四十开外、热情、直爽而又非常健谈的人。他曾作过纺纱工人，当过兵，担任过车间主任，作过党的群众工作。五年前当他调来这个区时，他是莫斯科州和莫斯科市的共青团书记。
  抓住经济领导中的基本环节
    我们首先请别戈夫同志谈谈区委在领导经济工作方面的经验。他笑着非常谦虚地对我们说，经验谈不上，只是几年来在经济工作的领导中，多少有一点体会。他认为，经济工作是一件十分复杂而且是千头万绪的工作，但只要抓住其中的基本环节，整个经济工作就能带动起来，而局部也就能推动全面。别戈夫说，他在领导经济工作中首先是抓生产计划，生产计划的完成与否，是考验区委对生产领导成败的关键。但完成生产计划，并不能仅仅满足于完成产量和产值的计划，而应当要求完成一切方面的生产计划，这样才能真正达到全面地、有节奏地、平衡地进行生产。第二个要抓的是，提高劳动生产率的问题。别戈夫说，提高劳动生产率主要是靠推广自动化与机械化，也就是要在各工厂中广泛设置自动化操作线，更新设备，安装传送带。只要自动化与机械化工作搞好，那么在一个工厂的基础上等于成立了几个新的工厂。他认为，在经济领导中抓降低生产成本和提高产品质量也是很重要的。这主要靠广泛发动群众来进行，因此，大力支持各企业的生产合理化运动和技术革新运动是区委最重要和最经常的工作之一。别戈夫说，加强工厂企业的政治工作也是一个十分重要的问题。假使车间工段的政治工作搞不好，工人的劳动热情和生产积极性就不能充分发挥出来，那么任何要完成生产计划、提高劳动生产率和降低生产成本都是一句空话。别戈夫说，他在经济领导中除了抓关键性和全面性的问题外，还经常抓那些小的和局部性的问题，因为这些问题如不及时发现和解决，它就会影响到经济工作的全面开展。
  思想工作有了显著的加强
    休息片刻之后，我们的话题转到了区委对思想工作的领导方面。别戈夫对我们说，党的思想工作在近年来有了显著的加强，这主要表现在党员思想水平的提高，党内干部学习制度的改进和群众宣传工作质量的提高上。他说，你要知道区委对思想工作重视的程度，只要看区委书记的分工便可以知道了。区委第一书记除负责全盘工作外还分工掌管思想工作，第二书记负责组织工作，第三书记负责经济。
    别戈夫很耐心地向我们介绍了今天区委思想工作的现状，他说，整个思想工作分三部分：一是党内的时事政策与理论学习；二是日常的群众宣传工作；三是对学校教育的领导。他说无论在哪方面这几年来都有很大的进展，特别是在时事政策与理论学习方面。一般干部学习的坚持精神较前大大增强了。学习制度和学习组织也比以前有很大的改进。通过理论学习解决实际问题和理论与实际联系的学习风气在党内也已普遍形成。在群众宣传工作方面，虽然在制度上与过去并无什么改变，但现在强调要领导人员亲自动手，而且在宣传方法上要强调与群众的思想实际、共产主义建设实际密切地联系起来，而且在宣传中要求形式多种多样，内容活泼生动。现在全区有将近二千名宣传员和二百名报告员，他们根据区委和基层党组织的指示，每周都有一次到两次向群众展开宣传工作。在学校教育方面，目前主要的任务是放在教育改革上，全区三十八所中学，在今年暑假后，有十八所将要改成八年制。今年暑假后将有大批青年学生到各工厂企业去进行劳动，目前做好对这一部分青年的政治思想工作，也是一个十分重要的任务。
    别戈夫认为，目前苏联已进入了一个新的思想建设时期。共产主义建设事业的各方面，都要有巨大的发展，因此整个思想工作也要适应着这一形势而发展。目前思想工作最重要的任务，就是对全体苏联人民进行全面的共产主义教育，也就是说要把全体苏联人民对国家、对工作、对生活的认识水平提高到共产主义的水平；要把每一个劳动者都培养成共产主义的积极建设者，培养成共产主义的新人。别戈夫说，目前在全苏劳动人民中所开展的共产主义劳动工作队运动，实际就是苏联人民进行自我教育运动的伟大的开端。
    别戈夫说，1959年是思想工作极其繁重的一年，不久前在区委所召开的党代表会议上，代表们一致要求，今年一定要把思想工作作为工作重心，并把力量配备上去。按照现在的初步计划，今年一年内将要有计划地解决以下一些问题：进一步加强党员的政治思想教育、青年的劳动教育与共产主义教育，大力宣传无神论与科学，推广先进的学习经验，宣传在两种制度的和平经济竞赛中社会主义必然胜利。
    发扬列宁式的工作作风
    最后，我们请别戈夫同志介绍了基层党的生活近年来的变化。别戈夫说，变化当然是很大的，这一切集中表现在党的决议贯彻得更彻底、党的各种工作水平的提高、党和群众关系的更加密切上。别戈夫认为，近几年在党内生活上最显著的变化，就是大大发扬了党的列宁式工作作风。所谓列宁式的工作作风，就是服从真理，坚持原则，关心群众和大大发扬党的民主生活，在这一基础上的党的团结和党的意志更加巩固和统一了。现在解决任何较大的问题都不能个人决定，而必须是在民主集中制的基础上来解决。别戈夫认为，任何来自个人方面的经验毕竟是局部的和狭隘的，而来自大多数方面的经验才是全面的和完整的。三年来党的领导方法也有很大改变，从前区委的领导干部，把大部分的时间都放在办公室里，放在草拟公文和各种决议以及频繁的会议上。从前一个星期至少有三四次会，而每次会都是长达七八小时，有时整整一天。因为会议多，领导干部总是抽不出足够的时间到下面去，这样日子一久，底下的情况摸不清楚，指导工作就发生困难。现在一星期只开一次会，而且每次会议时间不得超过五小时，在草拟公文和决议上，现在要求明确扼要，字数上也要精简到最少限度。现在区委书记们差不多每月有十七八天的时间可以到下面去，而且每周有一天用来专门接待群众。党和群众的关系也更加密切了。以这次对七年计划报告提纲讨论为例，差不多将近两个月来，群众在讨论中所提出的意见共有几千条，群众对国家利益的关怀更加深了。
    对别戈夫同志的访问，使我们进一步了解了苏联的基层党委的工作。莫斯科无产阶级区是苏共全国成千个基层区委的一个，我们从这个区的工作可以看到全国基层区委工作的一斑，我们从这个区的几位区委书记身上也可以看出全国基层组织工作人员的朝气勃勃和干劲冲天的工作作风。（附图片）
