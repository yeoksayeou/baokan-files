Attacking the "High Sulfur" Barrier
Kong Sang

Eighteen million tons of steel is the leap forward target for the steel industry this year. This target requires not only quantity but also quality. To produce good steel, the objective condition for steel mills is to rely on the quality of pig iron, while the subjective factor depends on how to remove impurities, especially sulfur, which is most harmful to steel quality, during the smelting process.

We have produced a lot of high-quality iron, including iron produced by indigenous methods. At present, factories are constantly improving the quality of iron, which is a strong guarantee for making good steel. However, due to the decentralized production of indigenous iron, different raw materials, and operating methods, the quality cannot be exactly the same, and some inevitably contain higher sulfur content. However, even this indigenous iron with higher sulfur content can also be used to make good steel. Steel mills in many places such as Zhuzhou, Zhengzhou, and Shanghai have used indigenous iron with higher sulfur content to produce qualified steel, and the achievements of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company published in today's newspaper are another proof. Indigenous iron can be made into qualified steel, and it must be made into qualified steel. This is an economic task and a political task.

To accomplish this task, the key lies in putting politics in command, following the mass line, and carrying out creative production activities on a large scale. Here, we must overcome technical barriers, and the first is to overcome an ideological barrier. After receiving the indigenous iron, the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company Party Committee first grasped the important link of ideological work, mobilized the masses to discuss, and made everyone clearly realize the important significance of solving the problem of smelting steel from indigenous iron for accelerating the development of the steel industry. This laid the ideological foundation for fighting against high sulfur and overcoming the technical barrier. Just like fighting a war, first explain the task, unify wills, and boost morale. If this is not the case, but only the weaknesses of indigenous iron are seen, the weaknesses of indigenous iron are emphasized, and one is frightened by the impurities of indigenous iron, succumbs to high sulfur, or passively complains about the lack of good iron, waiting for good iron to make good steel, then it will hinder the development of subjective initiative and no longer seek ways to overcome difficulties in every possible way, thus failing to find ways to overcome difficulties. This is the reason why we must first overcome the ideological barrier.

The technical barrier is a meticulous economic work that requires mobilizing the masses to carry out a series of creative production activities. However, if we overcome the ideological barrier, establish the revolutionary spirit of "despising difficulties strategically," and add the scientific spirit of "attaching importance to difficulties tactically," it is not difficult to overcome. Isn't it through continuous experimentation and summarization that Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has explored a set of experiences in fighting against high sulfur? In fact, many measures in Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's set of experiences in fighting against high sulfur have been adopted by other steel mills. It's just that some factories have grasped this one measure but failed to grasp that one measure; or they grasped it tightly at one time but relaxed at another time. If everyone is like Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, from the raw materials entering the factory to the furnace, every process is not careless, so that sulfur may slip through this level, but cannot escape that level, just like fighting an annihilation war, defending every level and blocking everywhere, not giving the enemy a chance to breathe and escape, then we will achieve a complete victory in the fight against sulfur.

    攻打“高硫”关
    孔桑
    一千八百万吨钢是今年钢铁工业的跃进指标。这个指标不仅仅要求数量，也包含了质量。要拿出好钢，对于炼钢厂来说，客观条件是要靠生铁的质量好，主观上则决定于如何在冶炼过程中除去铁中所含的杂质，尤其是对钢质危害最大的硫。
    我们生产了很多质量很好的铁，其中也包括土法生产的铁。目前各个厂还在不断提高铁的质量，这是炼好钢的有力保证。但是，由于土铁的生产分散，原料和操作方法不同，质量不可能完全一样，有些难免含硫较高。然而，即使这些含硫较高的土铁，也同样能够炼出好钢。株洲、郑州、上海等许多地方的钢厂就曾用含硫较高的土铁炼成了合格钢，今天报上发表的重庆钢铁公司的成就又是一个明证。土铁可以炼成合格钢，也必须炼成合格钢，这是个经济任务，也是个政治任务。
    要完成这个任务，关键在于政治挂帅、走群众路线，大搞创造性的生产活动。在这里，必须过技术关，其中首先是过一个思想关。重庆钢铁公司党委拿到土铁后，首先抓住了思想工作这个重要环节，发动群众讨论，使大家明确认识到解决土铁炼钢问题对于加速发展钢铁工业的重要意义，这就为与高硫作斗争过技术一关打下了思想基础。就像打仗一样，先交代任务，统一意志，鼓足士气。如果不是这样，而是只看到土铁的弱点，强调了土铁的弱点，被土铁的杂质吓住，向高硫屈服，或者是消极地埋怨没有好铁，等待有好铁再炼好钢，那就会妨碍主观能动性的发挥，不再千方百计地探求克服困难的途径，因而也就无法找到克服困难的途径。所谓首先要过思想关，道理也就在此。
    技术关是细致的经济工作，需要发动群众进行一系列创造性的生产活动。但是，如果渡过了思想关，树立起“在战略上藐视困难”的革命气魄，再加上“在战术上重视困难”的科学精神，也并不难过。重庆钢铁公司不就是通过不断试验、总结，摸索出一套与高硫作斗争的经验吗？其实，在重庆钢铁公司的一套与高硫作斗争的经验中，很多措施是其他钢厂都曾采用过的。只是有的厂抓住了这一个措施，没去抓住那一个措施；或者是这一时抓得较紧，那一时又放松了。如果大家都像重庆钢铁公司那样，从原料进厂到出炉，每一个工序都不麻痹大意，使硫混过了这一关，却逃不出那一关，就像打歼灭战一样，关关设防，处处阻击，不给敌人喘息逃脱的余地，那就会使对硫斗争取得完满的胜利。
