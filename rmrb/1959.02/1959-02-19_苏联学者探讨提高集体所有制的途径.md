    Soviet Scholars Discuss Ways to Improve Collective Ownership

    Recently, many well-known Soviet scholars have discussed the ways to elevate collective ownership to ownership by the whole people in their writings. Scholars such as Fedoseev, Ostrovityanov, Glezerman, and Laptev believe that there are four aspects to the transition: First, consolidate and expand the collective farms' public accumulation funds. The measures proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to reorganize machine tractor stations and sell agricultural machinery to collective farms are of great significance in this regard. The realization of this measure will make this part of the public accumulation fund more closely resemble ownership by the whole people in terms of its composition and social nature; second, develop inter-farm production ties, so that the increasingly socialized labor exceeds the scope of individual farms, thereby raising the collective farm ownership to a higher level of socialization; third, further socialize farm labor and means of production, which can be manifested in the following ways: due to the development of the public economy, the relationship between it and individual sideline occupations will undergo changes that are beneficial to it, such as with the development of the farm's public economy, the increasing abundance of agricultural products, and the development of public services, the individual sideline occupations of the members will become economically unprofitable and gradually disappear; fourth, implement a series of other measures, such as transitioning to paying farm members' labor remuneration in the form of currency.

    苏联学者探讨提高集体所有制的途径
    最近苏联有不少知名学者在著文中探讨了把集体所有制提高到全民所有制的途径问题。费道谢也夫、奥斯特罗维季扬诺夫、格列则尔曼、拉普捷夫等认为过渡的途径有如下四个方面：一、巩固和扩大集体农庄的公积金。苏共中央提出的改组机器拖拉机站和向集体农庄出售农业机器的措施，对此具有重大意义，这一措施的实现，使这部分公积金在构成上和社会性质上更加接近全民所有制；二、发展农庄间的生产联系，使日渐社会化的劳动超出各个农庄的范围，从而使集体农庄所有制达到更高的社会化水平；三、使农庄的劳动和生产资料进一步公有化，这可以表现在：由于公共经济的发展，它和个人副业间的相互关系将发生有利于它的变化，如随着农庄公共经济的发展、农产品的日益丰富和公共事业的发展，庄员的个人副业在经济上将成为不合算而逐渐消失；四、实现一系列的其他措施，如过渡到以货币形式支付农庄庄员的劳动报酬等。
