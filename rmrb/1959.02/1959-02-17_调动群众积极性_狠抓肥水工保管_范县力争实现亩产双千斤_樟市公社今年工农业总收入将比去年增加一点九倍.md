This newspaper Jinan, February 16th report: The Chinese Communist Party's Fan County Committee in Shandong Province issued a letter of proposal for a wheat high-yield competition to all counties in the province, aiming to achieve a per-mu yield of two thousand jin for all 700,000 mu of wheat in the county. Currently, the wheat fields throughout the county have generally been top-dressed twice, with an average of 70,000 jin of coarse fertilizer and over 10,000 jin of soil-based and diluted fertilizer per mu. The 150,000 mu of "satellite fields" have been top-dressed four times or more. 620,000 mu of wheat have been irrigated throughout the county, with 300,000 mu being irrigated twice, and the satellite fields being irrigated three times or more. The wheat seedlings are growing well.
In order to strive for a per-mu yield of two thousand jin of wheat, the Chinese Communist Party's Fan County Committee further proposed the following measures for future wheat management: (1) Continue to strengthen the Party's leadership and implement political command. Systematically summarize and publicize the achievements of last year's Great Leap Forward and bumper harvest. Through airing views and debates, further arouse the enthusiasm and soaring drive of the broad masses, and launch a vigorous wheat field management movement. (2) Firmly grasp the key to increasing production, which is fertilizer, water, labor, protection, and management. Apply 120,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, and apply quick-acting fertilizer to the third-class seedlings to ensure that they are all upgraded before the Qingming Festival. Ensure that wells draw water, reservoirs open their gates, canals release water, and each plot is thoroughly irrigated. Water the wheat well five times before the wheat harvest: reviving water, jointing water, heading water, grain-filling water, and grain-attacking water. The satellite fields should be watered appropriately to ensure that all wheat is adequately watered. Vigorously carry out tool reforms and add 10,000 pieces of water-lifting tools and a large number of small farm implements before Qingming Festival to adapt to the needs of intensive field management of wheat. Universally establish insect prevention nets and implement the principle of prevention over treatment. In addition to spreading the existing 250,000 jin of native pesticides in stages, continue to process and manufacture more. Each team should establish a weather station, listen to weather forecasts on time, and prevent frost in a timely manner. Also, apply 500 to 1,000 jin of plant ash and potash fertilizer per mu to prevent lodging. When applying fertilizer and watering, simultaneously hoe the soil to loosen the soil and retain moisture, which will benefit wheat growth. (3) Divide the 720,000 mu of wheat fields into squares, plots, and mu, and fix contract quotas that are responsible to the end. Ensure that each square has a general and each plot has soldiers, and that the troops will not be withdrawn until the wheat is stored in the granary. (4) Organize four major campaigns before the wheat harvest: apply sufficient reviving fertilizer and thoroughly water for revival; heavily fertilize and irrigate during the jointing stage; heavily fertilize and irrigate during the grain-filling stage; and resolutely harvest well to ensure that every grain returns home. To do these tasks well, it is necessary to grasp both ends and lead the middle, and carry out the red flag competition movement.
Also reported that Fan County, Shandong, is centered around the movement of accumulating and manufacturing fertilizer, setting off a high tide of tool reform. From December of last year to the end of January of this year, more than 120,000 pieces of tools for accumulating, manufacturing, and transporting fertilizer have been reformed and created, increasing the efficiency of accumulating and transporting fertilizer by more than two times.

This newspaper, Guangzhou, February 16th report: The Zhangshi People's Commune in the suburbs of Shaoguan City, Guangdong Province, is taking measures to ensure that industrial and agricultural production this year will more than double compared to last year.
The total agricultural output value of the Zhangshi Commune last year increased more than four times compared to 1957. After deducting production costs, accumulation, and repayment of several years of national loans from the total income, the average annual distribution per person was 140 yuan, and the living standards of all commune members exceeded those of upper-middle peasants. All cadres and commune members have recently democratically formulated a larger leap forward production plan for this year. This plan stipulates that the total industrial and agricultural income this year will increase by 1.9 times compared to last year. The agricultural production plan stipulates that the entire commune will plant 31,000 mu of rice, with an annual yield of 5,000 jin per mu, an increase of 2,700 jin per mu compared to last year, reaching an average of 5,200 jin of grain per person throughout the commune (last year the average was more than 3,000 jin of grain per person). The amount of agricultural commodity production will increase by two times compared to last year. In industry, 24 projects and 43 factory buildings will be built and expanded this year, including agricultural machinery repair and processing, chemical fertilizers, agricultural and sideline product processing, building materials, steel mills, and power plants. The total industrial output value will increase by two times compared to last year.
This plan of the Zhangshi People's Commune was formulated after commune members fully discussed favorable conditions and fully considered difficult conditions. The commune members said that this year's basic farmland construction is much better than last year's, with more than 16,000 mu of land deep-plowed to a depth of more than one chi, and nearly half of the cultivated land has achieved garden-style cultivation and self-flowing irrigation. This year's seeds are fully prepared and have been sown and cultivated early, with more than 2,000 dan of fertilizer accumulated per mu of land, of which more than 500 dan are concentrated fertilizer. Last year's late-season rice only focused on water conservancy, fertilizer, and close planting, and the yield reached more than 1,700 jin per mu. It is possible that this year's two seasons of rice will achieve an annual yield of 5,000 jin per mu (2,500 jin per mu per season). Commune members also affirmed in the discussion that this year's leap forward has many favorable conditions that were not available last year. For example, the great development of industry and agriculture throughout the commune has provided experience in carrying out mass movements, large-scale management, and the "Eight-Character Constitution" for production technology. Last year's Great Leap Forward also prepared material conditions for this year. The entire commune has more than 600,000 yuan in cash this year, which can meet the needs of production funds and ensure that wages are paid monthly, while last year's financial resources were not strong, and production funds were still loans from the state.
The commune members said in the discussion that the biggest difficulty in realizing this year's comprehensive leap forward plan is the lack of labor. The solutions that the commune members have come up with are to vigorously grasp tool reform and further improve labor organization. The commune is now vigorously grasping the reform of transportation, agricultural tools, and processing tools. The commune's agricultural tool factory has concentrated more than 240 iron and woodworking workers to refine ox carts, horse carts, handcarts, new-style plows and harrows, seeders, and other tools. This year, in land leveling, ox cart and handcart roads will be built in more than half of the cultivated land. Wood production is an important project in the commune's industrial production, and the commune is striving to complete the "air transportation" of wood in a short period of time, which alone can save 30,000 strong laborers. In terms of agricultural and sideline product processing, in addition to using hydropower for rice milling, it is now further comprehensively using hydropower for flour milling, oil pressing, sawing wood, and fertilizer production.

    调动群众积极性　狠抓肥水工保管
    范县力争实现亩产双千斤
    樟市公社今年工农业总收入将比去年增加一点九倍
    本报济南16日电　中共山东范县县委向全省各县发出小麦丰产竞赛倡议书，要力争全县七十多万亩小麦，亩产双千斤。现在全县麦田一般已追肥两遍，平均每亩追粗肥七万斤，土化肥与浇稀一万多斤；十五万亩卫星田追肥四遍以上。全县已浇麦六十二万亩，其中三十万亩浇了两次水，卫星田浇到三次水以上。麦苗生长良好。
    为了力争小麦亩产双千斤，中共范县县委对今后小麦的管理进一步提出了以下的措施：（1）继续加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅。要系统总结和宣传去年大跃进、大丰收的成就，通过鸣放辩论，把广大群众的积极性和冲天干劲进一步调动起来，开展一个轰轰烈烈的麦田管理运动。（2）狠狠地抓住以肥、水、工、保、管为主的增产关键。每亩追肥十二万斤，三类苗加追速效肥，保证在清明前全部升级。作到井井提水，库库开闸，渠渠放水，块块浇透。麦收前要浇好五水：返青水、拔节水、孕穗水、灌浆水、攻粒水。卫星田要适当加水，让所有小麦喝足喝饱。要大搞工具改革，清明前要增添一万件提水工具和大量小农具，以适应小麦密植田间管理的需要。要普遍建立防虫网，贯彻防重于治的方针，除将现有的二十五万斤土农药，分期撒施外，并继续加工制造。队队要建立气象站，按时收听气象预报，及时防止霜冻。并要每亩追草木灰和钾肥五百斤至一千斤，防止倒伏。在追肥浇水时，还要作到边浇边锄，松土保墒，以利小麦生长。（3）把七十二万亩麦田划方、分片、分块、分亩，固定包干，一包到底，做到方方有将，块块有兵，小麦不入仓决不收兵。（4）麦收以前要组织四大战役：追足返青肥，浇透返青水；拔节时大追大浇；灌浆时大追大浇；还要坚决收好，保证颗粒还家。为了搞好这些工作，还要抓两头、带中间，开展红旗竞赛运动。
    又讯　山东范县围绕积肥造肥运动，掀起工具改革热潮。从去年12月到今年1月底，已改革和创制积造、运肥工具十二万多件，积肥运肥效率提高两倍以上。（胡雷）
    本报广州16日电　广东省韶关市郊区樟市人民公社，采取措施保证今年工农业生产比去年再翻一番多。
    樟市公社去年的农业总产值比1957年跃进了四倍多；总收入中除了生产成本、积累和还清几年的国家贷款外，平均每人全年分配一百四十元，全体社员的生活水平超过了上中农。全体干部和社员最近又民主制订出今年更大跃进的生产计划。这个计划规定，今年工农业总收入比去年增长一点九倍。农业生产规划中规定，全社种植水稻三万一千亩，全年亩产五千斤，比去年每亩增产二千七百斤，达到全社平均每人有粮食五千二百斤（去年平均每人有粮食三千多斤）。农业方面的商品生产量比去年增长两倍。工业方面，今年兴建扩建农具修配加工、化学肥料、农副产品加工、建筑材料、钢铁厂、电力厂等二十四个项目四十三个厂房，工业总产值比去年增长两倍。
    樟市人民公社这个规划，是在社员充分讨论有利条件，和充分考虑困难条件以后制订出来的。社员们说，今年农田基本建设比去年好许多，深翻达一尺以上的田已有一万六千多亩，近一半耕地达到园田化和排灌自流化。今年良种准备得充分，已提早播种和办田，每亩田积集了二千多担肥料，其中精肥就有五百担以上。去年晚造水稻只着实地抓了水利、肥料和密植，亩产就达到一千七百多斤。今年两季水稻每亩达到年产五千斤（每造每亩二千五百斤）的指标是可能的。社员们讨论中还肯定今年跃进更有很多去年根本没有的有利条件。例如，全社工农业的大发展，给今年提供了大搞群众运动、大规模经营管理和生产技术上的八字宪法的经验。去年大跃进又为今年准备了物质条件。全社今年有现金六十多万元，能满足生产资金需要和保证每月发放工资，而去年家底不厚，生产资金还是向国家贷的款。
    社员们在讨论中说，实现今年全面跃进规划碰到的最大困难是劳动力不足。社员们想到的办法是大抓工具改革，以及进一步改善劳动组织。现在这个社正大抓运输、农具、加工等工具改革。公社农具厂已集中了二百四十多名铁、木工精制牛车、马车、手推车、新式犁耙、播种机等工具。今年在平整土地中，要在一半以上耕地修好纵横交错的牛车和手推车道路。木材生产是这个社工业生产中的重要项目，公社正在争取短期完成木材“空中运输化”，仅这一项就能省出三万个强劳动力。农副产品加工方面，除已利用水力碾米外，现在正进一步综合利用水力磨粉、榨油、锯木板和制肥等。　（郑世文）
