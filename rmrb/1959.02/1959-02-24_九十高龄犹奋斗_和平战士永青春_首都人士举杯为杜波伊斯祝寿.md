Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd: Tonight, the renowned American black scholar Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois joyfully celebrated his ninety-first birthday in the capital of the Chinese people.

Tonight, at a birthday banquet held by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife, along with Guo Moruo, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Wu Yuzhang, Mao Dun, Zhang Xiruo, Ding Xilin, Da Punsheng, and over a hundred other prominent figures from various circles, gathered at the Beijing Hotel to wish this elder, who has fought for democracy, freedom, and world peace throughout his life, longevity and evergreen vitality.

This ninety-one-year-old American black leader, at the exceptionally joyous birthday celebration, told his Chinese friends that he never imagined he could live to see such an unforgettable birthday. He said he wanted to "grow younger and younger." At this moment, everyone raised a glass to his good wishes.

The New Seventh Floor Hall of the Beijing Hotel was decorated tonight entirely in accordance with traditional Chinese birthday customs. Red lanterns shone brightly, and incense candles filled the air. On the wall in the center of the hall hung a longevity banner presented by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. Embroidered in the middle of the banner was a prominent large character for "Longevity," surrounded by flourishing pine, bamboo, and plum branches. Flanking the longevity banner were longevity couplets written by Guo Moruo himself. The upper line read: "Adding glory to colored races, a true man of iron, we admire this elder." The lower line read: "Striving for world peace, the east wind blows gently, may your life reach a hundred years." On the longevity table, covered with a red gold-trimmed tablecloth, were placed many gifts symbolizing longevity, including Buddha's hand citrus, ruyi scepters, fragrant citrus fruits, longevity peaches, and longevity noodles. A plate of longevity peaches and a plate of longevity cakes, gifts from Premier Zhou Enlai, were also placed on the longevity table. On both sides of the longevity table were pots of evergreens and baskets of flowers. All of this expressed a common wish: to wish Dr. Du Bois longevity and continued contribution to the progress of mankind! At 7:30 p.m., Dr. Du Bois and his wife arrived at the hall, which was called the Longevity Hall. The hall was filled with joy, and everyone offered heartfelt congratulations to the ninety-one-year-old birthday star, Dr. Du Bois. Dr. Du Bois and his wife were beaming with happiness.

Guo Moruo delivered a congratulatory speech at the beginning of the birthday banquet. His speech expressed the admiration of thousands upon thousands of Chinese people for Dr. Du Bois. Guo Moruo said that there is an old Chinese saying, "It is rare to live to seventy years old," and ninety-one years old is even more precious. Our ninety-one-year-old birthday star, Dr. Du Bois, is especially worthy of our praise because of his fighting life. Guo Moruo said that countless laboring people in America and Africa, groaning under monopoly capital and racial discrimination, regard Dr. Du Bois as their banner of struggle. At the same time, Dr. Du Bois and his wife, Shirley Graham, have consistently and sincerely supported the Chinese people's liberation struggle and worked for the world peace movement. The Chinese people, who have experienced countless hardships and only recently liberated themselves from the control of imperialism, cannot help but express their love and respect for our birthday star when they recall the days of past struggles. Guo Moruo said that it is undeniable that American imperialism is the number one enemy of the world's peace-loving people today. Living in such a harsh political environment full of deception and high pressure, Dr. Du Bois' persistent struggle for decades truly represents the desire for peace and justice of the American people in a glorious way.

Guo Moruo said that, facing our birthday star, Dr. Du Bois, we see a good example of the American people. We are very willing to maintain peaceful and friendly exchanges with the American people, so we feel very honored to be able to celebrate his ninety-first birthday here with the most outstanding representative of the American people, Dr. Du Bois.

Guo Moruo concluded by saying that, venerable elder, your health shows that you still possess vigorous vitality. Mankind has entered spring. Due to your further unremitting efforts in the future, the development of things will further inspire and strengthen the confidence of the American people, the African people, and the people of the whole world in a bright future.

During the birthday celebration, a warm congratulatory telegram sent by Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling from Shanghai was also read, as well as congratulatory telegrams from the Soviet Union and the United States, and the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic in China.

At this joyous birthday celebration, people could not suppress their inner excitement and gladly took up pens to write poems and draw paintings to bless Dr. Du Bois! Three elderly people over the age of eighty wrote congratulatory messages, wishing Dr. Du Bois "longevity like pine and cypress." They were Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, and Da Punsheng. Chen Banding, an eighty-four-year-old, painted a lotus flower to represent "eternal peace," and then he painted a colorful painting of "peaches that bear fruit every three thousand years." Wu Yuzhang's poem read: "Human rights are inherent and inviolable, striving for liberation brings joy to all; I wish you continued struggle at ninety, victory will ultimately belong to you." Shao Lizi wrote: "All within the four seas are brothers, peace fighters are forever young." Zhao Puchu, a figure from the Buddhist community, wrote an eight-line poem in seven-character verses, which said: "Across the ocean, we joyfully meet today, mutually proving that our hearts are the same and our principles are the same. Together we celebrate the full moon and people's longevity, thousands of flowers bloom and dance in the east wind." Lao She and his wife, Hu Jieqing, also jointly presented poems and paintings. Hu Jieqing painted a tree with peach blossoms in full bloom, with two strong doves soaring high. Lao She wrote in his poem: "Ten thousand peach trees, spring like the sea, wishing longevity, peace doves come."

The birthday celebration became more and more lively. Light music filled the hall, and literary and artistic workers from the capital performed one wonderful program after another. American friends attending the birthday banquet also sang "Happy Birthday."

People presented the birthday gifts they brought to the distinguished guests, expressing their goodwill. These included longevity banners from Zhang Xiruo, Ding Xilin, Tian Han, and Peking University, longevity fruits (peanuts), early birth of a son (red dates), and many children (grapes) from Wu Han, longevity star figures from Zhu Boshen and Tang Mingzhao, and a longevity cane from Lao She.

Dr. Du Bois excitedly accepted these gifts, repeatedly expressing his gratitude. He also personally cut the longevity cake given to him by Premier Zhou Enlai and invited everyone to share it.

Before the end of the banquet, Guo Moruo, borrowing Dr. Du Bois' words, wished him to grow younger and younger, and wished that people all over the world could live a peaceful life.

According to Xinhua News Agency on February 23rd, more than a thousand teachers and students of Peking University gathered this afternoon to warmly celebrate the ninety-first birthday of the famous American black scholar and member of the World Peace Council, Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois. Dr. Du Bois delivered a long speech entitled "China and Africa" at the meeting in enthusiastic language, which was warmly welcomed.

After 1:00 p.m., Dr. Du Bois and his wife, accompanied by Vice President of Peking University Zhou Peiyuan, walked into the venue. At this time, all the people participating in the meeting stood up and applauded enthusiastically for a long time to pay tribute to Dr. Du Bois. Dr. Du Bois happily clapped his hands to greet everyone.

Zhou Peiyuan first gave a speech. On behalf of all the teachers and students of Peking University, he expressed a warm welcome and heartfelt congratulations to Dr. Du Bois and his wife on behalf of the younger generation of China. Zhou Peiyuan said that the name of Dr. Du Bois is very familiar and亲切 to us. Over the years, the contributions made by Dr. Du Bois to maintaining world peace, opposing racial discrimination, promoting the cause of human progress, and enriching the world's cultural treasury have long left an indelible impression in our hearts. Zhou Peiyuan hoped that Dr. Du Bois would give them more guidance and criticism, and wished him longevity and health.

After Zhou Peiyuan's speech, in the midst of warm applause, two female students, representing all the teachers and staff of Peking University, presented flowers to Dr. Du Bois and his wife.

When Dr. Du Bois was invited to speak at the meeting, thunderous applause swept through the venue. In his speech, Dr. Du Bois praised the liberation of the Chinese people and the victory of construction in all aspects, and also issued a call to the African people.

Dr. Du Bois' speech aroused bursts of enthusiastic applause from time to time. After the speech, the students performed song and dance programs for the distinguished guests. Today, some teachers and students from the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute and the Institute of International Relations also participated in the birthday celebration. (See picture)

    九十高龄犹奋斗　和平战士永青春
    首都人士举杯为杜波伊斯祝寿
    新华社23日讯　今天，美国著名黑人学者杜波伊斯博士在中国人民的首都欢乐地度过了他的九十一岁寿辰。
    今天晚间，在和大和对外文协举行的祝寿宴会上，陈毅副总理和夫人，郭沫若、沈钧儒、黄炎培、吴玉章、茅盾、张奚若、丁西林、达浦生等各界著名人士共一百多人，在北京饭店祝贺这位为民主自由和世界和平奋斗一生的老者长寿，祝他松柏长青。
    这位九十一岁高龄的美国黑人领袖在欢乐非凡的祝寿会上对他的中国朋友说，他从来没有想到他竟能活到有这样一个使他永怀不忘的生日，他说他“要越活越年青”。这时候所有的人都为他的美好愿望喝了一杯酒。
    北京饭店新七楼大厅今晚完全按照中国传统的祝寿的风俗装饰起来。这里，红灯闪亮，香烛缭绕。大厅正中的墙壁上，高悬着和大和对外文协赠送的寿幛；绣在寿幛中间醒目大“寿”字上的松、竹、梅枝茂花盛。寿幛两旁是郭沫若亲笔书写的寿联，上联是：“替有色种族增光铁中铮铮钦此老”，下联是：“为世界和平努力东风习习寿期颐”。在红色贴金桌布铺着的寿桌上，摆着许多象征长寿的礼品，其中有佛手、如意、香圆、寿桃和寿面。周恩来总理赠送的一盘寿桃和一盘寿糕也放在寿桌上。寿桌两旁，是一盆盆长生草和一个个百花篮。这一切都表达了一个共同的心愿：祝杜波伊斯博士长寿，继续为进步人类造福！七时半，杜波伊斯博士和他的夫人来到了这个被称为寿堂的大厅，大厅里喜气洋溢，人人都向九十一岁的寿星杜波伊斯博士致衷心的祝贺。杜波伊斯博士和夫人乐得春风满面。郭沫若在寿宴开始时致祝词，他的祝词表达了千千万万中国人民对杜波伊斯博士的敬慕心情。郭沫若说，中国有句老话“人生七十古来稀”，九十一岁就更足珍贵了。我们九十一岁的寿星杜波伊斯博士，由于他战斗的一生，尤其值得我们赞扬的。郭沫若说，多少呻吟于垄断资本与种族歧视下的美国和非洲的劳动人民把杜波伊斯博士当作了他们斗争的旗帜；同时，杜波伊斯博士和他的夫人歇莉·格雷姆对于中国人民解放斗争的支援和对于维护世界和平运动的努力也是一贯真诚而热情的。一百年来经历过多少苦难，才从帝国主义的控制下获得了解放的中国人民，回溯起过去斗争的日子，就不自禁地对我们的寿星要表示热爱和尊敬。郭沫若说，无可讳言，美帝国主义是当前爱好和平的世界人民的第一号敌人。处在这样一个充满着欺骗与高压的恶劣的政治环境之下，杜波伊斯博士坚持不懈地奋斗了几十年，实在是极有光辉地代表了美国人民爱好和平和正义的愿望。
    郭沫若说，面对着我们的寿星，杜波伊斯博士，我们看到美国人民的一个好典范。我们十分愿意和美国人民保持和平友好的交往，因此我们感到很大的荣幸，今天能够在这里和美国人民的最优秀的代表，杜波伊斯博士，欢度他九十一岁的寿辰。
    郭沫若最后说，可尊敬的长者，您的健康情况正说明您还蕴酿着旺盛的活力。人类已经进入春天了。事物的发展，由于你今后的更进一步的不懈的努力，将会更加鼓舞和坚定美国人民、非洲人民、全世界人民对美好未来的信心。

    祝寿会越来越热烈，一支一支轻音乐荡漾在大厅里，首都的文艺工作者表演了一个又一个精彩节目，参加祝寿宴会的美国朋友也合唱了一曲“愉快的生日”。
