    Experiences in Carrying Out the "Three-Five" Movement
    Duan Jianwu, First Secretary of the CPC Lezhi County Committee
    Lezhi County, Sichuan Province, by correctly implementing the principle of combining handicraft industry with the machinery industry and combining indigenous production methods with foreign production methods, consistently adhered to the policy of relying on the masses, self-reliance, and small-scale indigenous groups in the mass movement to develop the machinery industry. Therefore, in October 1958, in just over a month, it basically achieved the task of the "Three-Five" Movement proposed by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the CPC: each district and most of the people's communes’ farm tool factories were equipped with five simple machine tools (three lathes, one planer, and one drill); each commune and some production teams had five major mechanical tools (namely thread plates, vises, bench drills, hacksaws, and files); and they made full use of electricity, water power, animal power, hand cranking, and foot pedals, and other five types of power, according to local conditions.
    As pointed out by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the CPC, carrying out the "Three-Five" Movement is the direction to quickly achieve semi-mechanization. Achieving the tasks stipulated by the "Three-Five" Movement can basically solve the production and repair problems of improved tools, establish a backbone and foundation for the great development of commune industry, greatly improve labor efficiency, and has urgent significance for further developing the industrial and agricultural production of the commune. This is exactly the case. Although the indigenous machine tools in our county are all made of iron, wood, and stone, they can still turn, mill, and plane, achieving the goal that small repairs of farm tools can be done within the commune, and major repairs can be done within the factory. The various tools manufactured have shown great power in five areas: agricultural product processing, transportation, water conservancy, cultivation, and capital construction, greatly reducing physical labor and improving labor efficiency. For example, in terms of agricultural product processing, the efficiency has increased three to five times due to the widespread promotion of sweet potato slicers, threshing machines, and feed processing tools. In terms of transportation, the county manufactured more than 160,000 carts, handcarts, and indigenous trains, basically realizing the carting of rural transportation. In terms of water conservancy construction, it not only supplied more than 100,000 pieces of various water conservancy tools, but also manufactured equipment such as water turbine shafts for thirteen power stations. In terms of tillage tools, it timely supplied more than 160,000 pieces of plows and harrows such as rope-traction machines and row seeding machines, basically realizing the improvement of tillage plows and harrows, and powerfully promoted the winter deep plowing movement. In terms of capital construction, in addition to producing machine tools to arm itself, it also manufactured small industrial equipment such as blowers and cement grinders, promoting the development of commune industry. According to county-wide statistics, the above five aspects can save more than 56 million labor days a year, equivalent to increasing 1,800 laborers. Facts have proved that vigorously carrying out the "Three-Five" Movement can not only greatly improve work efficiency, save labor, and reduce labor intensity, but also is the correct path to quickly achieve rural semi-mechanization and gradually achieve agricultural mechanization and electrification.
    Carrying out the mass-based "Three-Five" Movement is a new task. In addition, the industrial base of the county is backward, and the entire movement is a process of exploration.
    The following are our experiences:
    First, the "Three-Five" Movement is a revolutionary measure. From the very beginning, it encountered various ideological obstacles, especially among some cadres and technicians who believed that mechanical production must be done in large factories, and indigenous methods would not work. They also raised various difficulties, shouting that there was no equipment, no technology, and no raw materials, etc. They said: "Starting a business from scratch is wishful thinking, and you can't get eggs without a hen," advocating asking the higher authorities for machine tools, technicians, and raw materials. There were also some well-intentioned people who actively went to various places to purchase equipment and raw materials, but they failed in most of their attempts, and their enthusiasm waned. The county committee analyzed these ideological situations in a timely manner, believing that the main reason was that they were not clear about the direction and methods of vigorously carrying out the "Three-Five" Movement, and there was serious superstition. To solve these problems, it is first necessary to put politics in command, break superstition, emancipate the mind, and adhere to the policy of large-scale small indigenous groups, focusing on indigenous methods and progressing from indigenous to foreign methods. To unify ideological understanding, the county committee organized the vast number of cadres and workers to launch a debate, clarifying the direction of the road to rural semi-mechanization. At the same time, the leading comrades of the county committee went deep into reality, personally grasped points, relied on the masses, and created experience. County Committee Secretary Li Xinnian, together with the workers of the May 1st Machinery Factory, researched and trial-produced the first iron-wood-stone structure simple lathe (using only 20 kilograms of iron) and timely convened an on-site meeting to summarize and promote it. In less than ten days, 25 district and commune farm tool factories across the county had produced this simple lathe, further breaking the superstition that the machinery industry was unattainable. People who originally had conservative ideas also changed their views in the face of the facts, laying a good ideological foundation for the development of the "Three-Five" Movement.
    Second, mobilizing and relying on the masses can solve all the difficulties encountered in the "Three-Five" Movement. For example, building a factory requires equipment, tools, and technical personnel. At that time, we had no equipment, no engineers, and no technicians. The only two hundred blacksmiths, plowshare casters, and pot menders did not understand the technology of manufacturing machines. Some people had never even seen what a lathe looked like. At the same time, the source of raw materials such as coal and iron also became a problem. These were all practical difficulties placed before us. However, the county committee also saw the favorable factors that could overcome the difficulties, that is, the county had two old belt lathes, and "with a hen, you can hatch chicks"; there were also a few workers who had used machine tools in the past and tank soldiers and quartermasters who had been transferred from the army, with this group of backbone members, we could train our own technical team; there were also scrap iron and steel accumulated by rural and urban residents for many years, which could be mobilized to solve the raw material problem; more importantly, the vast number of masses had an urgent demand and soaring enthusiasm for realizing semi-mechanization. To promote mass wisdom and creative spirit, county, district, and commune levels successively held technological innovation mobilization meetings, calling on the vast number of masses to emancipate their minds and create boldly, and at the same time formulated reward measures to encourage the masses to innovate technology and contribute ideas. In just over a month, the county put forward 412 rationalization proposals for reforming tools and innovating technology, rapidly pushing the "Three-Five" Movement to a climax. The masses of the Huilong Commune used the iron discs and iron rods of the cotton gin frame to install tool holders and convert them into simple lathes. The employees of the Transportation and Repair Factory used two pieces of wood and screws to make simple vises, and so on. At the same time, technical repatriation was carried out throughout the county, and 86 technicians and technical workers were transferred from government agencies and demobilized soldiers to serve as technical backbone in various factories and stations. We adopted methods such as master teaching apprentice, experienced workers leading novices, inviting people in for guidance, sending people out for study, on-site visits, and running short-term technical training classes to cultivate and strengthen the technical team. In the case of a lack of raw materials, we mobilized the masses to carry out the "Three Contributions" (copper, iron, wood) movement. In less than two months, the county contributed 2.45 million kilograms of scrap iron and 390,000 kilograms of scrap copper.
    Third, the secretary taking command, strengthening leadership, overall collaboration, and common leap forward are important guarantees for the healthy development of the entire movement. To strengthen the leadership of this movement, the county, district, and commune party committees each designated a secretary to manage this work and transferred more than 60 cadres to serve as leaders of district and commune farm tool factories. At the beginning of the movement, there was a period of imbalance in technology and equipment and a disconnection in the supply of raw materials. To reverse this situation in a timely manner, under the unified leadership and specific organization of the county committee, the county, district, and commune signed agreements on learning from each other's strengths and supporting each other, and carried out comprehensive large-scale collaboration in production, technology, materials, and labor. Many units actively launched a warehouse clearing movement, taking the initiative to give up steel, pig iron, and equipment that could be used to manufacture mechanical equipment and were not needed for the time being to support mechanical production.
    In the past year, although we have achieved some results in vigorously carrying out the "Three-Five" Movement, compared to the higher demands put forward by the development of the situation, the distance is still very far, and there are still some shortcomings in our work. To meet the needs of the new situation and push the "Three-Five" Movement forward, we must continue to work hard.

    开展“三五”运动的体会 
    中共乐至县委第一书记　　段建武
    四川省乐至县由于正确贯彻手工业和机械工业相结合、土法生产和洋法生产相结合的原则，自始至终坚持了依靠群众、自力更生和小土群的方针，在机械工业上大搞群众运动，因而在1958年10月间，仅仅用了一个多月时间，基本实现了中共四川省委提出的“三五”运动的任务：全县每个区和大部分人民公社的农具厂，都装备齐五部简易机床（三部车床，一部刨床和一部钻床）；每个公社和部分生产队，都有五大件机械工具（即丝板，老虎钳，台钻，钢锯和钢锉）；并且因地制宜地充分运用电力、水力、畜力、手摇和脚踏等五种动力。
    正如中共四川省委所指出的，开展“三五”运动是迅速实现半机械化的方向。实现了“三五”运动所规定的任务，就可以基本解决改良工具的生产和修配问题，为公社工业大发展建立起骨干和基础，大大提高劳动效率，对进一步发展公社的工农业生产，有着迫切的意义。事实正是这样。我县土机床虽然都是铁木石结构的，但却同样能车、能铣、能刨，做到了农具小修不出社，大修不出厂。制造的各种工具，在农产品加工、运输、水利、耕作、基建等五个方面显示了巨大的威力，大大减轻了体力劳动，提高了劳动效率。例如，在农产品加工方面，由于普遍推广了红苕切片机、打谷机和饲料加工工具，工效提高了三至五倍。运输方面，全县共制造了架车、手推车和土火车十六万多部，基本上实现了农村运输车子化。在水利建设方面，不仅供应了各种水利工具十万多件，而且制造了十三个电站的水轮机轴等设备。在耕作工具方面，及时供应了绳索牵引机和开厢播种机等犁耙工具十六万多件，基本上实现了耕作犁耙改良化，有力地推动了冬季深耕运动。在基本建设方面，除生产机床武装了自己以外，还制造了鼓风机、水泥磨等小型工业设备，促进了公社工业的发展。据全县统计，上述五个方面，一年即可节约劳动日五千六百多万个，相当于增加了一千八百个劳动力。事实证明：大搞“三五”运动，不仅可以大大提高工效，节约劳动力，减轻劳力强度，而且也是迅速实现农村半机械化和逐步实现农业机械化、电气化的正确道路。
    开展群众性的“三五”运动是一项新的工作，加之本县工业基础落后，整个运动都是一个摸索过程。
    以下所述是我们的几点体会：
    第一，“三五”运动是革命性的措施，一开始就遇到了各种各样的思想阻力，特别是在一部分干部和技术人员中，认为搞机械生产一定要大工厂，土办法行不通。并且提出了种种困难，叫喊没有设备，没有技术，没有原材料等等。他们说：“白手兴家是妄想，没有母鸡下不出蛋”，主张向上级要机床，要技术员，要原材料。也有一部分好心肠的人，积极到各处去采购设备和原材料，但十处打捞九处空，碰了几次壁，劲头就消了。县委及时分析了这些思想情况，认为主要是对大搞“三五”运动究竟走什么道路，采取什么办法认识不明确，存在有严重的迷信思想。解决这些问题，首先必须政治挂帅，大破迷信，解放思想，坚持大搞小土群，以土为主，由土到洋的方针。为了统一思想认识，县委组织广大干部和职工展开了辩论，明确了农村搞半机械化道路的方向。同时，县委的领导同志又深入实际，亲自抓点，依靠群众，创造经验。县委书记李新年同志与五一机械厂工人研究，试制出第一台铁木石结构简易车床（只用铁二十斤）并及时召开现场会总结推广，不到十天，全县即有二十五个区、社农具厂造出了这种简易车床，进一步破除了机械工业高不可攀的迷信。原来有保守思想的人，也在事实面前改变了自己的看法，为“三五”运动的开展打下了良好的思想基础。
    第二，发动群众、依靠群众就可以解决“三五”运动中所遇到的一切困难问题。比如建工厂首先要有设备、工具和技术人员。当时我们既无设备，也没有工程师和技术员，仅有的二百多个铁匠、铸铧匠和补锅匠，他们都不懂得制造机器的技术，有的人甚至连车床像什么样子也没有见过。同时，煤铁等原材料的来源也成问题。这些都是摆在面前的实际困难。但是县委也看到能够克服困难的有利因素，这就是本县有两台破旧的皮带车床，有了“母鸡就能孵出小鸡”；还有少数过去曾经用过机床的工人和从部队上转业的坦克手和辎重兵，有了这批骨干就能培训出自己的技术队伍；还有农村和城镇居民多年积存的破废钢铁，动员出来就可以解决原料问题；更重要的是广大群众对于实现半机械化的迫切要求和冲天干劲。为了发扬群众智慧和创造精神，县、区、社都先后举行了技术革新誓师大会，号召广大群众解放思想，大胆创造，同时制定了奖励办法，鼓励群众革新技术献计献策。仅一个多月，全县提出了四百一十二件改革工具和革新技术的合理化建议，把“三五”运动迅速推向了高潮。回龙公社群众利用轧花机架子的铁盘铁杆，安上刀架改制成了简易车床。运输修配厂职工用两块木板加上螺丝，做成了简易老虎钳，等等。同时，在全县范围内进行了技术归队，从机关干部和转业军人中抽调了八十六名技术人员和技术工人，派到各个厂、站充当了技术骨干，并采取了师傅带徒弟，老手带新手，请进来指导，派出去留学，现场参观，开办技术短期训练班等办法，培养与壮大了技术队伍。在原材料缺乏的情况下，我们发动群众开展了“三献”（铜、铁、木材）运动，不到两个月时间，全县就献出废铁二百四十五万斤，废铜三十九万斤。
    第三，书记挂帅，加强领导，全面协作，共同跃进，是整个运动得以健康发展的重要保证。为了加强这一运动的领导，县、区、社各级党委都指定一个书记管理这项工作，并抽调了六十多名干部担任区、社农具厂的领导。运动开展之初，曾一度出现技术、设备不平衡和原材料供应脱节现象，为了及时扭转这种局面，在县委的统一领导和具体组织下，县、区、社签订了取长补短、互相支援的协议，在生产、技术、材料和劳动力方面开展了全面大协作。许多单位积极开展了清仓运动，把能制造机械设备的钢材、生铁和本身暂不需用的器具都主动让出来支援机械生产。
    过去一年中，我们在大搞“三五”运动中虽然取得了一些成绩，但比起形势发展对我们提出的更高要求，距离还很远，工作上也还存在着一些缺点。为了适应新形势的需要，把“三五”运动向前推进一步，我们还必须继续努力。
