Glass windows and white walls, the new village of the commune members is truly beautiful; when it gets dark, the biogas lamps are lit, illuminating both inside and outside the house.
The old folks move into new houses, their faces full of joy; the young men and women are even happier, dancing and singing under the light.
Everyone sings praises of the Communist Party, which has brought about great changes in the countryside; everyone praises Chairman Mao, who leads the people into paradise.
They stopped dancing and singing, and held a meeting in the auditorium to discuss in detail: the whole commune will engage in garden-style farming, to make the grain pile up in the barns.

    住新房
    甘肃张掖梁家墩人民公社社员顾　生玻璃门窗粉白墙，社员新村真漂亮；黑了点起沼气灯，屋里屋外亮堂堂。老人搬进新住房，满脸春风喜洋洋；姑娘小伙更心欢，灯下跳舞又歌唱。人人歌唱共产党，使得农村大变样；个个赞颂毛主席，领导人民进天堂。停了跳舞住了唱，礼堂开会细商量：全社大搞园田化，要叫粮食堆满仓。
