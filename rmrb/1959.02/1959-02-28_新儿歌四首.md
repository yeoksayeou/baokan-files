    Four New Children's Songs
    
    Iron Legs
    Don't call me a little devil, I have two iron legs.
    Tell me to find iron ore,
    I can climb mountains and cross rivers.

    Pulling Golden Gourds
    The iron tree blooms red flowers,
    Molten iron forms golden gourds.
    Brother drives a car,
    To pull the golden gourds.
    One truck isn't full in the morning,
    One truck isn't enough in the evening,
    Running back and forth four or five times in the dark,
    There's still a pile of golden nuggets left.

    Good to Herd Sheep in the Sunflower Shadow
    Sunflower,
    Faces the sun,
    Go to the sunflower tree for shade,
    The sun nods and smiles at me,
    I play hide-and-seek with the sun.
    "Little brother, where are you hiding?
    Come out and bask in the sun!"
    "I haven't left the sunflower tree,
    It's good to herd sheep in the sunflower shadow!"

    Digging the Canal
    The people's commune digs the canal,
    Digging until sweat flows into a river,
    Pick a watermelon and eat a meal,
    Watermelon seeds used as boats to cross the river.

    新儿歌四首
    放平
    铁腿别说我是小鬼，我有两条铁腿，叫我去找铁矿，我会爬山过水。
    拉金瓜铁树开红花，铁水结金瓜，哥哥开汽车，去把金瓜拉。早晨一车装不满，晚上一车装不下，摸黑跑了四五趟，还剩一堆金疙瘩。
  葵花影里好放羊向日葵，朝太阳，葵花树下去乘凉，太阳跟我点头笑，我跟太阳捉迷藏。“小弟弟，哪里藏？快快出来晒太阳！”“我没离开葵花树，葵花影里好放羊！”
    挖运河人民公社挖运河，挖得汗水流成河，摘个西瓜吃一顿，瓜子当船划过河。
