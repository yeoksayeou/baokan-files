    Don't Miss the Opportunity 　 Zi Yan
    In ordinary days, perhaps the easiest thing to overlook and the easiest to regret is time. In this river of time that silently passes by people, some can catch the ship to their destination in time; some will miss the boat and only catch it after a long delay; and some may never catch it. Although in the beginning, their conditions were roughly the same.
    Why is it that when dealing with the same problem and handling the same work, some people can achieve "twice the result with half the effort," while others achieve "half the result with twice the effort," and still others achieve "nothing at all"? There are indeed many various reasons for this, but in the face of many successes and failures, whether or not one can seize the time is a very important factor. This is not just a matter of work methods, but also a matter of thinking methods.
    Those who are full of energy and pay attention to difficulties in specific battles always think of the overall situation and bring the main tasks and key issues to today's agenda for resolution as early as possible. They never postpone today's affairs to tomorrow, but try to bring tomorrow's affairs forward to today. Therefore, the more they work, the smoother things go, and the more confident they become. Those who are content to be in the middle, walking the conventional path, lack a long-term perspective. When the tasks are lighter, they are relaxed and comfortable, but when everything is crammed together and the situation is pressing, they turn to "grabbing everything at once," often expending a great deal of effort but still failing to break through the encirclement. They attach great importance to "tomorrow." Unfinished work can be done "tomorrow," and uncompleted tasks can be pushed to "next year." Pushing and dragging, in the end, they accomplish nothing.

    莫误时机 　 兹言
    在平常的日子里，最容易被人忽视而又最容易使人后悔的恐怕莫过于时间了。这无声无息地从人们身畔默默走过的时间的河流里，有些人能及时搭上了通向自己目的地的轮船；有些人会错过了船期，迟之又久才能搭到；有些人甚至永远也搭不到。虽然在开始的时候，他们的条件是大致相同的。
    为什么对待同一个问题，处理同一样工作，有些人能做到“事半功倍”，有些人却“事倍功半”，有些人甚至“一事无成”呢？这中间固然有许许多多各种各样的原因，但是在许多成败得失的事件面前，能否争取时间，却是一个很重要的因素，这不单是工作方法的问题，也是思想方法的问题。
    凡是干劲充足、在具体战役上重视困难的人，他们处处为全局着想，尽早的把主要任务和带有关键性的问题，提到今天的议事日程来解决。他们绝不把今天的事推迟到明天，而是尽量把明天的事提到今天办。因此，他们越干越顺利，越干越有信心。那些甘居中游、按常规走路的人，缺乏远大眼光，处在任务较轻的时候，轻松自在，等到什么都挤在一起、形势迫人的时候，又转变为“眉毛胡子一把抓”，往往费尽九牛二虎之力，还杀不出重围。他们对“明天”很重视。干不完的工作可以“明天”做，完成不了的任务可以往“明年”推，推呀拖呀，到头来一事无成。
