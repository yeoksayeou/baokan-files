This newspaper, Tianjin, February 23rd Dispatch. Under the slogan of "The whole Party and all the people mobilize, work hard for thirty days," Hebei Province's people's communes, while vigorously accumulating fertilizer, are universally launching a high tide of crash wheat spring irrigation and farmland water conservancy construction, preventing drought early to ensure a bumper wheat harvest and timely spring planting, striving for a bumper harvest throughout the year.
　　Since last year, in order to adapt to the new situation of deep plowing, close planting, heavy fertilization, and large water demand, the people's communes in Hebei Province have concentrated their efforts on drilling machine wells and various water conservancy projects that can quickly play a role. According to statistics from early February, more than 250,000 laborers were invested in drilling wells. More than 53,000 machine wells have been completed in the province, and more than 10,000 are under construction. In addition, more than 6,700 ordinary wells have been dug and more than 3,000 canals have been opened. In mountainous areas, various soil and water conservation projects have been built, which can initially control a watershed area of 250 square kilometers. Recently, according to the characteristics of the province's more than 36 million mu of wheat, especially the more than 12 million mu of high-yield fields, which are heavily fertilized, deeply plowed, and densely planted, the people's communes in various places decided to irrigate the returning green water sufficiently before and after the returning green period; they also want to ensure that 9 million mu of spring wheat and early-maturing crops are irrigated before sowing to ensure timely sowing.
　　Under the call and encouragement of the Provincial Party Committee, all localities have strengthened specific leadership, and the movement has rapidly pushed to a high tide. Tianjin is strengthening its leadership to reverse the unbalanced development of machine wells. Tangshan Prefecture has redeployed water conservancy work, and leaders have divided up battle lines. Each commune is headed by the party committee secretary, and a special leading body is established to transfer strong cadres for specific leadership. The well-drilling professional team of Ya Hongqiao People's Commune in Yutian County has increased from 280 people in the past to 370 people, and launched a technical innovation competition, creating new methods such as using reeds instead of iron gauze and palm bark, which not only solved the problem of raw materials, but also improved work efficiency, shortening the time for drilling a machine well from three months in the past to about ten days.
　　In the process of drilling machine wells, all localities have conscientiously checked the quality of the machine wells. Shijiazhuang, Tangshan and other prefectures have adopted the method of accepting wells as they are drilled. Generally, the machine wells meet the quality requirements. With the increase of machine wells and water sources, Hebei is vigorously manufacturing and repairing drainage and irrigation machinery. In order to ensure that various water wells and water lifting equipment give full play to their irrigation efficiency, all localities are vigorously training driver technicians. At present, all localities are vigorously launching a crash spring irrigation, strengthening irrigation management work centered on garden cultivation.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, February 22nd. In order to prevent spring drought and ensure spring farming water, all parts of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are actively doing a good job in water storage, water conservation, water diversion and field irrigation. At present, a total of 2.7 billion cubic meters of water has been stored in ponds, reservoirs, ditches and dams throughout the region. Great achievements have also been made in diverting water for irrigation.
　　Since last winter, the Autonomous Region has closely combined deep plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and water conservancy construction with water storage, water conservation, and water diversion for irrigation. In early December last year, the leadership organs of Guixian County conducted a spring farming water consumption test in Miancun Commune and found that the water demand per mu of land increased to 206 cubic meters after deep plowing, while the existing water storage could not meet the needs of spring farming. The county party committee immediately asked all localities to conscientiously and comprehensively check the water storage situation, carry out engineering maintenance, ensure that the ponds and reservoirs are full of water and do not leak, and intercept all water sources. After Guixian County implemented the county party committee's instructions, the county's water storage rapidly increased to 200 cubic meters per mu. The area for spring irrigation in Yulin Prefecture reached more than 960,000 mu, and most of the spring farming water needs have been basically solved.
　　All parts of Guangxi have also strengthened the management of grassroots water use organizations, established systems, trained cadres, and imparted technology to ensure the smooth progress of spring irrigation water use. For example, each brigade of Chengguan Commune in Huanjiang County is equipped with full-time water managers, rationally dividing irrigation areas and establishing a production responsibility system for contracting irrigation and maintaining water volume. In the process of reorganizing water management organizations, Liyong Commune in Liujiang County stipulates that no one is allowed to open ponds indiscriminately, and all water discharge work is handed over to special personnel in charge. Many places have held meetings on engineering management and water storage and irrigation work to make full preparations for spring irrigation work.
　　Before spring irrigation, all localities inspected, repaired and reinforced the original water conservancy irrigation projects. Guiping, Yulin and other counties also adopted the method of inspecting and repairing projects while storing and conserving water and diverting water for irrigation, and did a good job in spring irrigation water use in a timely manner.

    河北大打深井扩大春播水源
    广西重视贮水保水预防春旱
    本报天津23日电　河北省各地人民公社在“全党全民齐动员，苦干大干三十天”的口号下，与大搞积肥的同时，普遍展开突击小麦春灌和农田水利建设高潮，及早防旱，以保证小麦丰收和适时春耕播种，争取全年大丰收。
    河北省去年以来，各地人民公社在水利建设上为适应土地深翻、密植、施肥多、需水量大的新情况，集中力量大打机井和很快就能发挥作用的各项水利工程。到2月上旬的统计，投入打井的劳力达二十五万多人，全省已打成机井五万三千多眼，正施工的还有一万多眼。此外，还打了普通井六千七百多眼，开渠三千多条；在山区已修建各种水土保持工程，可初步控制流域面积二百五十平方公里。最近，各地人民公社根据今年三千六百多万亩小麦，特别是其中一千二百多万亩丰产田肥多、深翻、密植等特点，要在返青前后浇足返青水；还要保证九百万亩春麦和早熟作物灌好播前水，保证适时播种。
    各地在省委的号召鼓舞下，都加强了具体领导，使运动迅速推向了高潮。天津市正在加强领导，扭转机井发展不平衡的局面。唐山专区把水利工作重新作了部署，领导划分战线，各公社均由党委书记挂帅，建立专门领导机构，抽调有力的干部进行具体领导。玉田县鸦洪桥人民公社的打井专业队，由过去二百八十人增加到三百七十人，开展了技术革新竞赛，创造了芦苇代替铁纱和棕皮等新方法，不仅解决了原料问题，而且提高了工作效率，由过去三个月打一眼机井缩短到十天左右打一眼。
    各地在打机井当中，认真的检查了机井的质量，石家庄、唐山等专区采取了随打井随验收的办法，一般机井合乎质量要求。河北各地随着机井和水源的增多，大力制造和修理排灌机械。为了保证各种水井和提水机具充分发挥灌溉效能，各地大力培训司机技术人员。目前，各地正在大力突击春灌，加强以园田化为中心的灌溉管理工作。
    新华社南宁22日电　为了防止春旱，保证春耕用水，广西僮族自治区各地正积极做好贮水、保水、引水和灌田工作。目前全区塘、库、沟渠、坝内共计贮了二十七亿立方的水。引水灌田也取得很大成绩。
    自治区从去冬以来，就密切结合深耕、积肥和兴修水利等工作进行贮水、保水和引水灌田。贵县领导机关去年12月上旬在棉村公社进行春耕用水试验，发现深耕后每亩田需水量增至二百零六立方，而现存水量却大大不能满足春耕需要。县委便立即要求各地认真全面检查贮水情况。进行工程岁修，保证塘库贮满水，不漏水，并把一切水源拦蓄起来。贵县各地执行县委指示后，全县贮水量迅速增至每亩二百立方。玉林专区进行春灌的面积达九十六万多亩，绝大部分的春耕用水已经基本解决。
    广西各地还通过整顿基层用水组织，建立制度，培训干部，传授技术，来保证春灌用水工作的顺利进行。如环江县城管公社各大队都配备了专职管水人员，合理划分灌溉区域，建立包灌水、包保持水量的生产责任制。柳江县里雍公社在整顿用水管理组织过程中，规定任何人不得乱开塘口，把全部放水工作交给专人负责。许多地方召开了工程管护和贮水、灌水工作会议，为春灌工作做好充分准备。
    各地在春灌前，对原有水利灌溉工程进行了检查、修补和加固工作。桂平、玉林等县还采取了边检查修补工程，边蓄水保水，边引水灌田的办法，及时做好春灌用水工作。
