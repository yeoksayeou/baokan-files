　　Xinhua News Agency, Durban, February 26th: Over 1,500 African dockworkers in Durban, on the east coast of the Union of South Africa, went on strike on the 25th demanding higher wages.

  The strike began on the 24th. At that time, 200 dockworkers went on strike, and by the next day, the strike wave had spread to all the docks in the port, resulting in paralysis of the port, affecting twenty-five ships docked there.

    After the strike, all of the more than 1,500 striking workers were fired and expelled from the African residential shacks. Subsequently, the government of the Union of South Africa, notorious for its implementation of the apartheid system, also sent police to suppress these angry, homeless African workers. It is reported that at least twenty African workers were seriously injured, and many workers were arrested.

    Xinhua News Agency: Durban Archbishop Denis Hurley protested at a mass rally against the recent racial discrimination measures taken by the government of the Union of South Africa—namely, the forced removal of 40,000 Indians from areas designated for white residents.

    南非码头工人罢工
    德班大主教抗议种族歧视措施
    新华社26日讯　南非联邦德班消息：南非联邦东海岸的德班港的一千五百多名非洲码头工人在25日举行罢工，要求提高工资。
  罢工是从24日开始的。当时，有二百名码头工人举行了罢工，到第二天，罢工浪潮蔓延到这个港口的所有码头，结果使这个港口陷于瘫痪，停泊港内的二十五艘船只受到影响。
    发生这次罢工以后，一千五百多名罢工工人都被解雇，同时被逐出非洲人居住的工棚。随后，以实行种族隔离制度而臭名远扬的南非联邦政府还派出警察，对这些愤怒的无家可归的非洲工人进行镇压。据报道，至少有二十名非洲工人受了重伤，许多工人被捕。
    据新华社讯　南非德班大主教丹尼斯·哈利在群众大会上抗议南非联邦政府新近采取的种族歧视措施——即要四万个印度人从规定给白人居住的地区迁出。
