    Promote the Foolish Old Man Spirit
    He Ming
    The story of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," found in "Liezi," is familiar to everyone. This story contains profound philosophical principles. Now, I will extract and translate it, and add a few comments.
    "The Taihang and Wangwu Mountains, each seven hundred li in circumference and ten thousand zhang high, were originally located south of Ji Prefecture and north of Heyang. In the north mountains lived a man called the Foolish Old Man, nearly ninety years old. His house faced these two great mountains. He deeply felt that his way was blocked by the two mountains, making it inconvenient to go in and out. Therefore, he gathered his family together to discuss the matter, saying: 'I and you will do our best to move these two mountains away and open up a direct road to Yu Prefecture, how about it?' Everyone agreed. Only his wife expressed doubt, saying: 'With your strength, you can't even move a small mound of earth, how can you move two mountains like Taihang and Wangwu? Moreover, where will you put so much earth and stone!' Everyone said: 'We will throw it into the tail of the Bohai Sea.' Thus, the Foolish Old Man led his sons and grandsons, carrying burdens, to the mountains to dig stones and earth, and transport them to the Bohai Sea. A seven- or eight-year-old child from a neighboring family also came to help. They kept digging incessantly, only returning home to change clothes when the seasons changed. A man called the Wise Old Man lived on the banks of the Yellow River. He chuckled and stopped the Foolish Old Man, saying: 'You are too foolish! With the remaining strength of your old age, you can't even damage a single hair of the mountain. How can you possibly move so much earth and stone?' The Foolish Old Man sighed and said: 'Your mind is too stubborn, so stubborn that you are not even as good as a seven- or eight-year-old child. When I die, I will have my son. My son will then have grandsons. Grandson will have sons, sons will have sons, and sons will have grandsons. The generations will be endless; but the mountains cannot increase. How can we not level them?' The Wise Old Man couldn't answer a word. The mountain god heard about it and, fearing that the Foolish Old Man and his family would dig incessantly, reported it to God. God was moved by the Foolish Old Man's determination and ordered the strong gods to move the Taihang and Wangwu Mountains away."
    This story not only expresses the great desire and heroic spirit of mankind to conquer nature but also contains rich philosophical wisdom. The Foolish Old Man's answer to the Wise Old Man is very much in line with the dialectics of finite and infinite. Every individual and every generation is finite. But mankind is infinite, and the descendants are endless; that is to say, the power of mankind to conquer nature is infinite. However, no matter how big and high the mountain is, it is finite. It cannot grow; the more you dig, the less it becomes. Using the infinite to deal with the finite, how can we not eventually level it?
    We have now begun to enter a great era of fighting the earth and being the masters of nature. "Making the river give way and making the mountains bow their heads" has become a reality of the great struggle, and we no longer need God's help. But in this great era, there are still a very few people with conservative ideas. In their view: "Setting high targets is not as good as setting low targets. If you set low targets, you can complete them without much effort. That is so safe! If the targets are set high, there may be a one in ten thousand chance of failing to complete them. How foolish is that!" In their view, they seem very clever, because according to their method, they can live in ease and comfort and do not have to struggle. For example, last year some activists vigorously engaged in "experimental fields." How enthusiastically should we encourage and value their initiative, wisdom, and experience! Those with conservative ideas also laughed at them, laughing at them as "fools." Because to achieve the yield targets of the experimental fields, it is necessary to pay unprecedentedly heavy labor. But the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year proves that it was the vast number of people with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man who achieved the final victory, not the conservatives. This year is a year of even greater leap forward, and we should continue to promote the spirit of hard work of the "Foolish Old Man" and oppose those conservative ideas that seek ease and comfort and think they are clever and calculating.

    发扬愚公精神
    何明
    “列子”所载“愚公移山”的故事，是大家十分熟悉的。这个故事富有深刻的哲理。现在把它摘译出来，并发一点议论。
    “太行、王屋两座山，方圆七百里，高有万丈。这两座山本来是在冀州以南、河阳以北。北山住着一位叫愚公的，快九十岁了。他家正面对着这两座大山。他深感被两座山挡住了去路，出入不便。于是，他召集全家人商量，说：‘我和你们尽最大努力把这两座山搬走，开辟一条直通豫州的大路，好不好啊？’大家都说好。唯有他的妻子表示怀疑，说：‘以你的力量，连一座小土山也搬不走，怎么能搬走太行、王屋这样两座大山？而且，那么多的土石，往哪里放啊！’大家说：‘把它投到渤海的尾巴里就是了。’于是，愚公率领他的儿子、孙子，挑着担子，到山上挖石掘土，往渤海里运。邻家一个七八岁的小孩，也跑了来帮助。他们一直掘个不休，只在换季节需要换衣服的时候，才回家一趟。在河套上住着一位叫智叟的。他讪笑着制止愚公说：‘你太傻了！以你这么大年纪的余力，连山的一根毫毛也毁不了。这么多土石，怎能搬净呢？’愚公叹着气说：‘你的心太顽固了，顽固得这么不通，连七八岁的小孩子也不如。我死了有我的儿子。我的儿子又生孙子。孙又生子，子又生子，子又有孙，子子孙孙是无穷无尽的；可是山却不能增加，怎么不能把它平掉呢？’智叟一句话也答不上来。山神听到了，害怕愚公他们挖个不休，报告了上帝。上帝被愚公的决心感动了，于是命令大力神把太行、王屋两座山搬走了。”
    这段故事，不仅表现了人类征服自然的伟大愿望和英雄气概，而且包含了丰富的哲学智慧。愚公回答智叟的话，很合乎有限和无限的辩证法。每一个人，每一辈人是有限的。但人类是无限的，子子孙孙是无穷无尽的；就是说，人类征服自然的力量是无限的。可是，山再大再高，它却是有限的。它不能增长，掘它一分就少了一分。以无限对有限，怎么不可以终于把它平掉？
    我们现在已经开始进入同地球作战、作自然界的主人的伟大时代。“要河水让路，让高山低头”，已经成了现实的伟大斗争，再也用不着上帝帮忙了。可是在这伟大的时代里，却还有极少数有保守思想的人。在他们看来：“订高指标不如订低指标，订低指标不用花多大力气就能完成，这多么保险？指标订高了，就可能有个万一完不成。这多么傻！”在他们看来，好像自己很聪明，因为按照他们的作法，就可以苟且偷安、不必奋斗。再例如，去年有的积极分子大搞“试验田”，对于他们的干劲、智慧、经验是应该如何热情地鼓励和重视啊！那些有保守思想的人也曾嘲笑过他们，笑他们“傻”。因为要实现试验田的产量指标，必须要付出空前繁重的劳力。可是去年大跃进的经验证明，取得最后胜利的，正是千千万万有着愚公移山精神的广大人民，而不是保守主义者。今年是更大跃进的一年，我们应该继续发扬“愚公”的苦干精神，反对那些苟且偷安而自以为聪明得计的保守思想。
