    Grasp the Key, Achieve Multiple Gains
    Yu Jingqi
    How can we overcome the difficulty of insufficient rural labor during the Great Leap Forward? The most effective method is to implement tool reform and achieve semi-mechanization. What is the main contradiction in the current tool reform? What measures should be taken to accelerate the realization of agricultural semi-mechanization? The "Three-Five" Movement proposed by Sichuan Province is an experience worth paying attention to.
    After a large number of new tools have been created and invented, the main task is to promote them. To promote them, the tools must be standardized for processing and manufacturing; this requires agricultural tool factories with certain technical equipment. At present, our rural machinery industry is far from being able to meet this requirement. This has become the main contradiction, or a key aspect, in realizing agricultural semi-mechanization at this stage. The characteristic of the "Three-Five" Movement is that it not only paid attention to machine tools but also to tools and power issues, comprehensively considering the needs of every link in tool manufacturing and repair. The practice in Sichuan Province proves that county, district, and some people's commune farm tool factories can have five machine tools (including three lathes, one planer, and one drill press), and all people's communes and some production teams can have five kinds of tools, which can solve the manufacturing and repair problems in the five aspects of agricultural product processing equipment, rural transportation tools, small-scale water conservancy tools, farm tools, and small-scale industrial equipment. These five aspects are precisely where the most rural labor is consumed at present. Solving the manufacturing and repair of tools and equipment in these areas will provide a reliable material guarantee for the realization of agricultural semi-mechanization. Moreover, the widespread use of five kinds of power to drive machine tools and various improved tools can maximize labor savings, improve working conditions, and increase work efficiency. These situations show that by grasping the "Three-Five" Movement, we are grasping the most important link in the chain of development in realizing agricultural semi-mechanization at this stage.
    This movement also has a more far-reaching significance. The "Three-Five" Movement not only solves the current problem of large-scale promotion and manufacturing of improved tools and ball bearings, but more importantly, it has built a local machinery industry network with county and district mechanical industries as the backbone. Relying on this machinery industry network to mass-produce various small-scale industrial equipment will inevitably promote the accelerated development of commune industries. Everything is constantly developing and continuously improving. The "Three-Five" Movement solves the production of tools for making tools—machine tools—which will inevitably promote the continuous improvement of the level of the rural machinery industry; due to the widespread use of electricity, especially with the increasing ability to produce power generation equipment (now some county machinery factories in Sichuan have manufactured small generators), the leap-forward development of the rural electric power industry can also be affirmed.
    The practice of the "Three-Five" Movement in various parts of Sichuan Province has also raised an important question for us: as long as we adhere to the Party's policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, self-reliance, relying on the masses, and taking the path of small-scale, indigenous groups, gradually improving from indigenous to foreign, many places can achieve the requirements of the "Three-Five" Movement. Many places in Sichuan have done this, and in two or three months or less, they have achieved great results, basically realizing the requirements of the "Three-Five" Movement, manufacturing a large number of new tools and ball bearings, and also producing some better machine tools. Lezhi County is such an example. Other places can also refer to the methods of Lezhi County and give it a try.

    抓住关键，一举数得

    如何克服大跃进中农村劳动力不足的困难？最有效的办法是实行工具改革，实现半机械化。当前工具改革中的主要矛盾是什么呢？采取什么措施才能加速实现农业半机械化呢？四川省提出的“三五”运动是一个值得重视的经验。
    新式工具在大量创造发明以后，主要的任务是推广。要推广，就必须把工具定下型来，进行加工制造；就需要有一定技术装备的农具工厂。现在我们农村中的机械工业力量还远不能和这一要求相适应。这就成为现阶段实现农业半机械化的主要矛盾，或者说是一个重要的关键。“三五”运动的特点是不仅注意了机床也注意了工具和动力问题，全面地考虑到了工具制造和修配的每一个环节的需要。四川省的实践证明，县、区和部分人民公社农具厂都能有五部机床（包括三部车床、一部刨床、一部钻床），所有人民公社和部分生产队都有五种工具，就可以解决现在农产品加工设备、农村运输工具、小型水利工具、农具和小型工业设备等五个方面的制造和修理问题。这五个方面正是目前农村耗费劳动力最大的方面。解决了这些方面的工具、设备制造和修理问题，就为实现农业半机械化提供了可靠的物资保证。而且，广泛利用五种动力，带动机床和各种改良工具，更能够最大限度地节约人力，改善劳动条件和提高工效。这些情况说明：抓住“三五”运动，就在现阶段实现农业半机械化中抓住了事物发展链条中最重要的一环。
    这个运动还有其更为深远的意义。“三五”运动不但解决了当前改良工具和滚珠轴承的大量推广制造问题，更重要的是建成了以县、区机械工业为骨干的地方机械工业网。依靠这个机械工业网大量生产各种小型工业设备，必将促进公社工业的加快发展。任何事物都是不停地发展，不断地提高的。“三五”运动解决了制造工具的工具——机床的生产，必然会促使农村机械工业水平不断提高；由于对电力的广泛利用，特别是加上生产电力设备能力的日益增大（现在四川已有县的机械工厂制造了小型发电机），农村电力工业的飞跃发展也是可以肯定的。
    四川省各地开展“三五”运动的实践，还为我们提出了一个重要问题：只要坚持党的土洋并举的方针，自力更生，依靠群众，走小土群的道路，由土到洋，逐步提高，很多地方都能实现“三五”运动的要求。四川许多地方这样做了，在两三个月内或更短的时间，就获得了很大成效，基本实现了“三五”运动的要求，制造了大量新工具和滚珠轴承，也造出了一些更好的机床。乐至县就是这样一个例子。其他的地方也可以参照乐至县的办法试试看。
