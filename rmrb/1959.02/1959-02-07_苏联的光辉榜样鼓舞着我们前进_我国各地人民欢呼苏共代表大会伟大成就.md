Xinhua News Agency, February 6th: People from all walks of life in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin celebrated the successful closing of the 21st Congress of the CPSU and congratulated the Soviet people on their brilliant achievements in the new era of fully developing the construction of a communist society.

　　The news of the successful closing of the 21st Congress of the CPSU has once again inspired the people of the capital, who are working harder and accelerating socialist construction. Deng Tuo, President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in Beijing, warmly congratulated the successful closing of the 21st Congress of the CPSU. He said that this meeting of great historical significance marks the entry of the Soviet Union into a new historical development period of fully developing communist construction. Comrade Khrushchev's report to the Congress summarized the rich experience of Soviet socialist construction and put forward a grand program for fully developing communist construction. The Chinese people, who have always regarded the victory of the Soviet Union as their own victory, are delighted and encouraged by this huge step taken by the Soviet people towards communism. Deng Tuo then talked about the issue of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. He said that we should further learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in all aspects to accelerate our country's socialist construction. Shi Wenyu, the train conductor of the international train that had just arrived from Moscow, excitedly said that the Soviet Union's magnificent seven-year plan shows that the final victory of socialism over capitalism is not far away! Ni Wanqi, an old worker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, said: The Soviet Union's seven-year plan for the development of the national economy has outlined a beautiful picture of the communist era for us. We must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, work with soaring enthusiasm to overfulfill the steel production plan for February, and strive to achieve the national steel production target of 18 million tons this year. The members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship People's Commune in Shijingshan, who have a deep friendship with the Soviet people, were inspired by the brilliant achievements of Soviet construction. They expressed their determination to work with greater enthusiasm to ensure the application of 50,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of land this year. The Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Beijing have widely studied and publicized the documents of the 21st Congress of the CPSU through reading, discussions, reports, and broadcasts. The officers and soldiers generally believe that this conference has profound and significant implications. Captain Zhen Ke of a certain unit said: The conference proves that the Soviet Union's economic strength has developed unprecedentedly, the international communist movement is unprecedentedly united, and the socialist camp is incredibly strong. Physicist and Director of the Physics Department of Peking University, Chu Shenglin, said that the Soviet Union has comprehensively launched communist construction, and the Soviet Union has surpassed the most developed capitalist countries in nuclear physics, atomic dynamics, jet aircraft, and rocket technology. The comprehensive development of communist construction in the Soviet Union encourages us to cultivate more and better construction talents for the motherland under the guidance of the Party's educational policy.

　　Shanghai

　　The people of Shanghai started in the morning to scramble to buy newspapers from post offices, newsstands on the streets, and vendors, repeatedly reading the news about the successful closing of the 21st Congress of the CPSU and the People's Daily editorial "The Congress Advancing Towards Communism." In the Jiangnan Shipyard, after the broadcast speakers announced the news of the successful closing of the conference, the workers in the shipbuilding workshop who were manufacturing the current largest train ferry in our country, the "Jiangsu," held a discussion, expressing their joyful and excited mood. Yan Chunhui, an advanced producer and fitter in Shanghai, said that the Soviet Union's announcement of entering a period of fully developing communist construction is a great happy event for our entire socialist camp. We must learn from the brilliant example of the Soviet people and accelerate the construction of socialism. Chen Wangdao, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Philosophy and Social Sciences and President of Fudan University, read the part of Comrade Khrushchev's report on "The New Stage of Communist Construction and Some Issues of Marxist-Leninist Theory" with particular care. He said: In his report, Comrade Khrushchev pointed out that the transition from socialism to communism is a lawful historical process that cannot be arbitrarily disrupted or skipped over; there is no wall between socialism and communism, and the transition to communism should not be regarded as some kind of slow movement. This viewpoint, which unifies the Marxist-Leninist theory of continuous revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages, and profoundly expounds on the differences and connections between socialism and communism, not only points out the path for the Soviet people to advance to communism, but also has guiding significance for all countries advancing along the path of socialism.

　　Tianjin

　　Representatives from all walks of life in Tianjin held a discussion tonight. Wang Xiaoyi, Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: For many years, the victories achieved by the Soviet people one after another have been an important source of encouragement for the Chinese people. The Soviet Union's march towards the grand construction period of fully developing communism is another great encouragement to the Chinese people who are building socialism. We are determined to redouble our efforts and make 1959 a year of even greater leaps forward. Representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and the scientific and religious circles who attended the symposium unanimously pointed out excitedly at the meeting that the 21st Congress of the CPSU was an epoch-making conference of great historical significance. We must further conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and accelerate the cause of socialist construction in our country. Factories, troops, government agencies, and schools in Tianjin have also held various gatherings to enthusiastically discuss Khrushchev's report.

    北京
    新华社6日讯　北京、上海、天津等城市各界人民欢庆苏共第二十一次代表大会胜利闭幕，祝贺苏联人民在全面展开共产主义社会建设的新时期中获得辉煌的成就。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会胜利闭幕的消息，再次振奋了正在鼓足更大干劲，加速社会主义建设的首都人民。北京市中苏友好协会会长邓拓热烈祝贺苏共第二十一次代表大会胜利闭幕。他说，这个具有重大历史意义的会议，标志着苏联正进入全面展开共产主义建设的新的历史发展时期。赫鲁晓夫同志向代表大会所作的报告，总结了苏联社会主义建设的丰富经验，提出了全面展开共产主义建设的宏伟纲领。从来就是把苏联的胜利当作自己的胜利的中国人民，为苏联人民向共产主义迈进的这一巨大步骤而感到欢欣鼓舞。邓拓接着谈到了学习苏联先进经验的问题，他说，我们应该进一步学习苏联各方面的先进经验，以加速我国的社会主义建设。刚由莫斯科开来的国际列车长石文玉兴奋地说，苏联宏伟的七年计划，说明了社会主义最后战胜资本主义已经为期不远了！石景山钢铁公司老工人倪万奇说：苏联发展国民经济的七年计划，为我们描出了共产主义时代的美妙图景。我们一定要学习苏联先进经验，以冲天的干劲超额完成2月份产钢计划，为实现今年全国产钢一千八百万吨而奋斗。与苏联人民有着深厚友谊的石景山人民公社中苏友好社的社员们，为苏联建设的光辉成就所鼓舞，他们表示要以更大的干劲，保证为今年每亩地施肥五万斤而奋斗。中国人民解放军驻京部队，对苏共第二十一次代表大会的文件，通过阅读、座谈、做报告广播等形式进行了广泛的学习和宣传，官兵们普遍认为这次大会有极深远的重大意义。某部大尉甄科说：大会证明苏联经济力量空前发展，国际共产主义运动空前团结，社会主义阵营力量无比强大。物理学家、北京大学物理系主任褚圣麟说，苏联已经全面地展开了共产主义建设，苏联在原子核物理学、原子动力学、喷气式飞机、火箭技术等方面已超过了最发达的资本主义国家。苏联全面展开共产主义建设，鼓舞着我们在党的教育方针的指导下，为祖国培养更多更好的建设人才。
　　上　海
    上海人民从早晨开始就从邮局从大街上的售报站和小贩手中争购报纸，反复阅读有关苏共第二十一次代表大会胜利闭幕的消息和人民日报关于“向共产主义前进的大会”的社论。在江南造船厂，广播喇叭传出大会胜利闭幕的消息以后，制造当前我国最大的火车渡轮“江苏号”的造船车间工人，就举行座谈会，表示自己欢欣鼓舞的心情。上海市先进生产者装配工严纯辉说，苏联宣布进入全面展开共产主义建设时期，是我们整个社会主义阵营的大喜事，我们一定要学习苏联人民的光辉榜样，加速建设社会主义。上海市哲学社会科学联合会主席、复旦大学校长陈望道对赫鲁晓夫同志报告中关于“共产主义建设的新阶段和马克思列宁主义理论的若干问题”那一部分读得特别认真。他说：赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中指出，由社会主义向共产主义过渡，这是个合乎规律的、不能任意破坏或越过的历史过程；在社会主义和共产主义之间并没有隔着一座墙，不能把向共产主义过渡看作是某种缓慢运动。这种以马克思列宁主义的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相统一的观点，对社会主义和共产主义的区别和联系的问题所作的深刻阐述，不但指出苏联人民向共产主义前进的道路，而且对于一切沿着社会主义前进的国家，也都富有指导的意义。
　　天　津
    天津各界代表今晚举行了座谈会。中国人民政治协商会议河北省分会副主席王笑一说：多少年来，苏联人民所取得的一个又一个的胜利，一直是中国人民的重要鼓舞力量。苏联迈向全面展开共产主义宏伟的建设时期，这对正在建设社会主义的中国人民又是一个巨大的鼓舞，我们决心更加鼓足干劲，让1959年成为更大跃进的一年。出席座谈会的各民主党派、各人民团体和科学界、宗教界的代表等都在会上一致兴奋地指出：苏共二十一次代表大会是划时代的、具有伟大历史意义的大会。我们要进一步认真学习苏联先进经验，加速我国社会主义建设事业。天津市的工厂、部队、机关、学校，也纷纷举行各种集会，热烈讨论赫鲁晓夫的报告。
