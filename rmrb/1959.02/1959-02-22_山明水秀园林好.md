    Beautiful Scenery, Fine Gardens
    Chen Junyu
    In the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes," there is a passage that reads: "Efforts should be made to gradually reduce the existing cultivated land area for planting crops to, for example, about one-third within a few years, based on local conditions. The remaining land should be used for crop rotation, planting pasture and green manure, and another part should be used for afforestation and digging lakes for water storage. A wide variety of ornamental plants with vibrant colors can be planted on plains, mountains, and water surfaces to implement the gardenization of the land." Gardenization is a grand ideal that can be realized. As long as we conscientiously promote high-yield measures such as deep plowing and careful cultivation, layered fertilization, and rational close planting, and greatly increase the grain yield per unit area, it is entirely possible to use a portion of the land to implement the gardenization of the land. At that time, over 60% of the 9.6 million square kilometers of land in the country will be beautiful forests, and China's climate and scenery will be greatly improved. The weather will be sunny and the breeze gentle, with spring-like conditions in all seasons, making for magnificent mountains and rivers and pleasant scenery!
    Gardens are the nurturers and regulators of moisture. In open areas lacking trees, significant changes in moisture will occur once afforestation and gardens are established. For example, in Minqin County, Gansu Province, with 17 to 18 million mu of land, trees were scarce and the weather was dry in the past. Since liberation, about 5 million mu have been closed off for sand control and afforestation. The annual rainfall has increased significantly compared to the past, and the air is also more humid. Professor Nesterov of the Soviet Union calculated that one hectare of forest evaporates a total of 1 million to 3.5 million kilograms of moisture into the air throughout the year, accounting for 62% to 70% of rainfall and snowfall. Others have measured that the relative humidity in the air is 36% higher in forests than in courtyards, and 27% higher in parks than in cities. If we widely plant shelterbelts in the north and coastal areas, we can generally reduce gales of level seven or eight to level four or five. At the same time, we can also stabilize sand dunes and transform deserts into fertile land. Linzhang County, Hebei Province, used to be a place where people's lives were seriously threatened by wind, sand, waterlogging, and drought. Since liberation, the Party has led the masses to vigorously plant trees and create forests. More than 90,000 mu of sandy wasteland have been stabilized, and crop yields have increased from dozens of jin per mu to around 1,000 jin.
    The long hot summer is one of the characteristics of China's climate. Rice, sweet potatoes, cotton, peanuts, persimmons, pears, peaches, plums, etc., can be planted in the vast areas of the north and south... This is China's unique advantage. But precisely because of this, it is necessary and possible for us to give full play to the positive role of gardens in regulating temperature. In the scorching heat of summer, it is much cooler in the dense forests of towering trees and in parks with dense shade. Generally, the summer temperature in forests is six to eight degrees lower than in city courtyards, and the temperature difference between the ground in forests and the roads in cities is as much as thirteen to fourteen degrees.
    In gardens, as a result of photosynthesis by plants, the air contains more oxygen. Under the action of the atmosphere, these areas are also prone to produce ozone. This has an important medical effect for patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Patches and clumps of trees and flowers are also like filter paper, which can block and absorb dust, soot, gas, and other harmful gases emitted from densely populated, industrial, and mining areas, preventing them from flying around. According to surveys, the dust content in the air in forest areas is only about 7% of that in industrial and mining areas; the dust content in urban parks is about 39% of that in city centers. The concentration of sulfur gas in the air in industrial and mining areas is about 1.2 to 3.4 times that of gardens and parks, and 2 to 14 times that of suburban areas.
    Afforestation and planting grass can also conserve soil and water. After comprehensive management and rational tree planting in mountains, fields, and river channels, soil erosion can be reduced and waterlogging and drought disasters can be prevented. For example, Jiabi People's Commune in Cixian County, Hebei Province, is all mountainous. In the past, it was either long-term drought with no harvest, or mountain floods that caused disasters to people and animals. However, the Party has long led the people in this old revolutionary base to open up terraced fields and develop diversified operations. In recent years, it has also built reservoirs, dams, dug fish-scale pits everywhere, and afforested and closed off mountains. One day last summer, there was a heavy rain of 150 millimeters, and the water did not rush down the mountain. Today, the mountains are lush with trees, laden with fruits, and have bountiful harvests of grain. The poor mountains and bad waters have become rich mountains and good waters.
    Gardenization integrates comprehensive production, transformation of nature, and beautification of the country. From some typical examples and initial results, it can be seen that its benefits are truly endless. Let us strive to increase grain production and gradually realize our great and beautiful ideal—gardenization!

    山明水秀园林好
    陈俊愉
    在“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中有一段写着：“应当争取在若干年内，根据地方条件，把现有种农作物的耕地面积逐步缩减到例如三分之一左右，而以其余的一部分土地实行轮休，种牧草、肥田草，另一部分土地植树造林，挖湖蓄水，在平地、山上和水面都可以大种其万紫千红的观赏植物，实行大地园林化。”园林化，这是一个可以实现的伟大理想。只要认真推广深耕细作、分层施肥、合理密植等丰产措施，使单位面积的粮食产量大大提高后，用一部分土地来实行大地园林化是完全能够办到的。那时候，在全国九百六十万平方公里的土地上，将会有60％以上的面积都是森林美景，我国的气候与风光也大为改观，真是日丽风和，四季如春，江山壮丽，风景宜人！
    园林是水分的孕育者与调节器。在缺乏树木的空旷地区，一经造林建园，就会在水分方面发生显著的变化，例如甘肃民勤县一千七、八百万亩的土地上，过去是树木稀少，天气干旱，解放以来封沙、植树共约五百万亩，年雨量就比过去提高很多，空气也湿润一些了。苏联的聂斯切罗夫教授计算过：一公顷森林全年蒸发到空气中的湿气总量，高达一百到三百五十万公斤，占降雨、降雪量的62％—70％。还有人测量过不同地点的空中相对湿度是森林比庭院高36％，公园比城市高27％。如果我们在北方和沿海地区遍植防护林，一般就可把七、八级的大风减弱为四、五级。同时还可以使沙丘固定起来，变沙漠为良田。河北临漳县原是个风沙水旱严重威胁人民生活的苦地方，解放以来党领导着群众大力植树造林，九万多亩沙荒已经固定，作物产量也由亩产几十斤达到千斤左右的水平。
    夏季炎热期较长，是我国气候的特点之一，在南北广大地区都可栽种水稻、甘薯、棉花、花生、柿、梨、桃、李……这是我国得天独厚之处。但也正因为这样，我们就有必要和有可能来充分发挥园林在调节气温上的积极作用。在赤日当空的炎夏时节，在参天大树的密林里和浓荫遍地的公园中，就会凉爽得多。一般森林中的夏季温度比城市庭院里要低六到八度，而林间地面与城市马路上的温度，相差竟达十三到十四度之多。
    园林里，由于植物进行光合作用的结果，空气含氧较多。在大气的作用下，这些地区还易产生臭氧。这对肺结核患者来说，更有其重要的医疗作用。成片成丛的树木花草还好比滤纸一般，能把由人烟稠密、工矿林立之处所散出的灰尘、烟烬、煤气及其他的有害气体，阻滞而吸附在叶子上，不再让它们四处飞扬，据调查：森林地区空气含尘量只有工矿区的7％左右；城市公园含尘量约为市中心的39％。工矿区的空气中含硫气体浓度约为花园公园的一点二到三点四倍，为城郊地区的二到十四倍。
    造林种草还可保持水土，涵养水源，山野河渠在综合治理、合理种树之后，能减少水土冲刷，预防水旱灾害。例如河北磁县贾璧人民公社尽是山区，过去不是久旱不雨，颗粒无收，就是山洪暴发，人畜遭殃。但是党在这老根据地很早就领导人民开辟梯田，发展综合经营，近年更修筑水库、拦河坝、遍挖鱼鳞坑、造林封山。去年夏天有一天落了一百五十毫米的大雨，水都没有冲下山去。如今山上树木青葱，果品累累，粮食丰收，穷山恶水变成了富山善水。
    园林化集综合生产、改造自然、美化全国的作用于一身，从一些典型事例和初步成果中，已可看出它的好处真是说不完。让我们努力提高粮食产量，逐步实现我们伟大而美丽的理想——园林化吧！
