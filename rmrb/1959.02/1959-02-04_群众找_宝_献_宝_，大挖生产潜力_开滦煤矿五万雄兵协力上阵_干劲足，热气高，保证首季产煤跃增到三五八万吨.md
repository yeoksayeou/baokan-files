The Kailuan Coal Mine's 50,000-Strong Workforce Joins Forces
Full of Energy and High Spirits, Guaranteeing the First Quarter's Coal Production Will Leap to 3.58 Million Tons

(Our newspaper's Tianjin dispatch, 3rd) The 50,000 workers of the Kailuan Coal Mine in Tangshan are launching a competition movement to compare drive, learn from the advanced, and catch up with the advanced, guaranteeing the completion of the first quarter's leap forward plan to produce 3.58 million tons of raw coal, increasing the daily production level by 20% compared to last year.

In order to complete the leap forward plan, this mine held a comprehensive leap forward swearing-in meeting for the entire mining area's first quarter work at the Linxi Mine on January 19th and 20th.

Before and after this leap forward swearing-in meeting, the workers of each mine in Kailuan all adopted the form of large-scale airing of views, free airing of views, large-scale debates, and on the basis of summarizing the experience of last year's Great Leap Forward, and in the spirit of assigning twelve-part measures for ten-part targets, mobilized the masses to find "treasures," contribute "treasures," tap production potential, and formulate concrete measures. After the various "magic weapons" of last year's Great Leap Forward were revealed through meetings of all sizes, large-scale airing of views, free airing of views, and big-character posters, the broad masses of workers immediately launched a red flag competition movement to compare drive, learn from the advanced, and catch up with the advanced.

The six mining areas of Tangshan Mine proposed to guarantee that the first quarter's coal mining would exceed the original plan by 12,400 tons, and formulated specific measures. The Second Mining Area proposed to give full play to mechanical efficiency, and use one knife and two blasts for the combined coal cutter in mining face 1591, achieving a daily cutting distance of 100 meters. The tunneling area organized nine rapid tunneling teams to carry out competitions. The Ma Congshan team from mining face 9813 in the First Tunneling Area adopted double electric drills, leaving grooves between shifts, and using chalk to draw lines, guaranteeing a monthly advance of 1,000 meters, striving for 1,200 meters. The Development Area guaranteed to complete the footage plan of 2,718.48 meters five days ahead of schedule, striving for one week. After these plans were proposed, the workers of the Bai Xiaofeng tunneling team from mining face 2411 actively learned advanced experience and improved operating methods, and created the highest record in the entire mine of a single-hole hard rock daily advance of 10.6 meters on January 19th.

Workers at the Tangjiazhuang Mine also put forward more than 500 innovation proposals. According to these proposals, the Sixth Mining Area tackled and resolved the key problems of pressure plate and floating plate that frequently occurred in the thin coal seam of the coal cutting machine, and determined to create a new record of 30,000 tons of coal per month in the thin coal seam. The hydraulic coal mining area formulated a solution to key technical problems such as insufficient water source, uncoordinated mining and tunneling, dewatering, and screening machines, guaranteeing that the output of hydraulic coal mining in the first quarter would reach 30% of the total output of the mine.

The Zhangjiagou Mine proposed to overcome the backward state this year, strive to move upstream, and catch up with and surpass the advanced Tangshan Mine in terms of overall efficiency.

In the competition movement, the new workers also demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm and soaring drive. They proposed to maintain normal attendance around the Spring Festival, guarantee timely vacations, return to the mine on time, do a good job of publicity when going home, and actively participate in the Spring Festival maintenance work if the work requires it; they also proposed to learn from the advanced thinking and communist style of the old workers, and establish the idea of ​​taking the mine as their home; and earnestly learn technology from the old workers, studying hard and practicing diligently; obey the command of leaders and masters, and guarantee the safe and over-fulfillment of production tasks. To this end, they also held a swearing-in meeting for normal attendance during the Spring Festival and put forward a competition initiative to the new workers of Tangshan City.

In order to guarantee the successful realization of the first quarter plan, each mine in Kailuan put forward measures to vigorously run satellite factories, save raw materials, and use substitutes in the spirit of self-reliance. At present, each mine is experimenting with self-rolling steel, self-producing cement, and self-making native lathes. According to the plans of each mine, in the vigorous development of raw material production and equipment manufacturing in the first quarter, they will produce 1,000 tons to 1,500 tons of steel, 500 to 1,000 tons of iron, and also produce a large amount of cement, bricks, ductile iron, etc. The Tangshan Mine's self-made cement has reached the degree of self-sufficiency.

In addition, in order to ensure the smooth development of the competition and ensure the comprehensive completion of the production tasks in the first quarter, each mine has strengthened production preparation and safe production work. Each mine has generally carried out a major safety inspection, summed up experiences and lessons, formulated safety measures, and included safe production as one of the competition contents.

    群众找“宝”献“宝”，大挖生产潜力
    开滦煤矿五万雄兵协力上阵
    干劲足，热气高，保证首季产煤跃增到三五八万吨
    本报天津3日电　唐山开滦煤矿五万职工，正掀起一个比干劲学先进赶先进的竞赛运动，保证完成第一季度生产原煤三百五十八万吨的跃进计划，使日产水平比去年提高20％。
    这个矿为了完成跃进计划，1月19、20两日在林西矿召开了全矿区第一季度工作全面跃进誓师大会。
    开滦各矿职工在这次跃进誓师大会前后，都采取大鸣大放大辩论的形式，在总结去年大跃进经验的基础上，本着十分指标十二分措施的精神，发动群众找“宝”，献“宝”，挖掘生产潜力，制订具体措施。通过大会小会大鸣大放大字报等形式把去年大跃进的各种各样“法宝”亮出来以后，广大职工便立即展开了比干劲、学先进、赶先进的红旗竞赛运动。
    唐山矿六个采矿区提出保证第一季度采煤比原计划超额一万二千四百吨，并订出具体的措施。第二采煤区提出充分发挥机械效能，一五九一掌康拜因割煤用一刀两炮，日割可达百公尺。掘进区组织九个快速掘进队开展竞赛，一掘进区九八一三掌马从善队采用双电钻、班与班留槽子、粉笔画线法，保证月进一千公尺，争取一千二百公尺。开拓区保证提前五天，争取一周完成二千七百一十八点四八公尺的进尺计划。这些计划提出后，白晓峰掘进大队二四一一掌工人，积极学先进经验改进操作方法，1月19日就创造单孔硬岩日进十点六公尺全矿最高纪录。
    唐家庄矿职工也提出五百多项革新建议。根据这些建议，第六采煤区突击解决了割煤机在薄煤层中经常发生的压盘、漂盘等关键问题，决心在薄煤层中创月产煤三万吨的新纪录。水力采煤区订出解决水源不足、采掘不衔接、脱水、筛机等技术关键方案，保证第一季度水力采煤的产量达到全矿总产量30％。
    张家沟矿提出在今年内要克服落后状态，力争上游，在全员效率方面要赶上和超过先进的唐山矿。
    在竞赛运动中新工人也表现了高度的劳动热情和冲天干劲。他们提出春节前后正常出勤，保证按时休假，按时返矿，回家时作好宣传工作，如工作需要就积极参加春节检修工作；还提出要学习老工人的先进思想和共产主义风格，树立以矿为家的思想；并认真向老工人学习技术，苦学苦练；服从领导和老师傅的指挥，保证安全超额完成生产任务。为此，他们还举行了春节正常出勤的誓师大会，向唐山全市新工人提出了竞赛倡议。
    为了保证第一季度计划的胜利实现，开滦各矿都本着自力更生的精神提出大办卫星厂、节约原材料、使用代用品的措施。现各矿都在试验自己轧钢、自产水泥、自造土车床等。据各矿计划，第一季度在大搞原材料生产和设备制造中，要生产一千吨到一千五百吨钢、五百到一千吨铁，同时还要生产大量水泥、砖、球墨铸铁等。唐山矿自制水泥已达到自给自足的程度。
    此外，为了保证竞赛的顺利开展，保证第一季度生产任务的全面完成，各矿都加强了生产准备和安全生产工作。各矿普遍进行了安全大检查，总结了经验和教训，制订了安全措施，并把安全生产列为竞赛内容之一。
