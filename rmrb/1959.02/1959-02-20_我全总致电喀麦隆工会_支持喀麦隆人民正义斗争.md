    Xinhua News Agency, February 19th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions yesterday sent a telegram to the United Labor Federation of Cameroon, expressing, on behalf of all Chinese workers, the warmest support and respect to the Cameroonian workers and people who are heroically carrying out the struggle against colonial rule and for national independence.
    The telegram said that French and British colonialists, with the support of U.S. imperialism, have carried out cruel rule and frenzied suppression of the Cameroonian people. The 650 million people of China resolutely oppose this colonialist policy and vow to stand with the Cameroonian people. We firmly believe that the heroic Cameroonian people, who are strengthening unity and persisting in the struggle, will thoroughly eliminate colonial rule and achieve national independence at an early date.
