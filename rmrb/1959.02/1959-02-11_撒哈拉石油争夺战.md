    The Scramble for Saharan Oil
     On January 21st, the U.S. New Jersey Standard Oil and the French Petroleum Company, along with Petropal (a French government investment group), signed an agreement in which New Jersey Standard Oil will conduct exploration on 20,000 square kilometers of land in the eastern Grand Erg region of the Sahara for a period of five years. According to the British "Financial Times," in the joint venture composed of the above three companies, New Jersey Standard Oil will receive half of the profits, while the French Petroleum Company and Petropal will receive 35% and 15% of the profits, respectively.
    New Jersey Standard Oil is the largest American oil company controlled by the Rockefeller family. Dulles once served as its legal advisor. New Jersey Standard Oil's entry into the Sahara marks a new stage in the scramble for Saharan oil resources by international oil monopoly capital groups.
    The struggle of international oil monopoly capital for the Saharan wealth, which originally belongs to the African people, has a long history. In the early 1950s, French monopoly capital successively lost its territories in Syria, Lebanon, and Indochina, and was squeezed out by the Americans in Morocco and Tunisia. Thus, it actively sought new sources of raw materials in the Sahara. In 1956, France discovered two large oil fields in the Sahara, one in Hassi Messaoud and the other in Edjeleh, bordering Libya.
    The French monopoly capital group established oil wells in the Hassi Messaoud area of Algeria. The extracted oil flows through a small six-inch diameter pipeline to Touggourt on the railway line, and then is transported by train to the port of Philippeville on the Mediterranean coast. By the end of 1958, about 400,000 tons of oil had been transported. All the surveying work for the construction of the Hassi Messaoud-Bougie oil pipeline has also been completed. The pipeline laying is now progressing across the desert at a rate of two miles per day. It is expected that the first oil through this pipeline will reach France by the end of 1959. It is estimated that the Saharan oil reserves are about one-sixth of the world's known reserves. France is extremely short of oil. In 1958, France consumed 27 million tons of oil, worth $310 million, of which $290 million was paid in foreign exchange. France plans to extract 1.7 million tons of oil in the Sahara in 1959, 8.7 million tons in 1960, and 20 million tons in 1963.
    Besides the forty companies and several of the largest banks controlled by French monopoly capital, the British oil monopoly organizations Shell and British Petroleum, and several companies from West Germany and Italy have also broken into the Sahara.
    For a long time, American monopoly capital has also been coveting the rich resources of the Sahara. The American oil monopoly group is well aware that if Saharan oil is completely controlled by French and British capital, the huge profits earned by Americans from selling Middle Eastern oil will be severely affected. As early as six years ago, the American Texaco Oil Company was eager to get involved in Saharan oil, but was rejected by France at that time. However, because the French government is pursuing a policy of attempting to rely on the United States to maintain its colonial rule, it has had to succumb to the pressure of American monopolists. In the past two years, the number of "independent" American oil companies participating in the development of the Sahara has reached as many as six or seven.
    After de Gaulle came to power, on the one hand, he put forward the general program of French monopoly capital plundering the Sahara in October 1958—the so-called Algerian Development Plan, attempting to massively plunder the wealth of the Sahara to increase his own status; on the other hand, on November 16, 1958, he passed the so-called "Oil Law," allowing foreign oil companies to enter the Sahara if they give half of the profits to the French government. De Gaulle's government did this not only to attract oil companies from the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany to jointly plunder the Sahara while ensuring its own dominance, but also to influence the foreign policies of these countries by allowing their oil companies to share a piece of the pie, so as to make these countries support France's plan to annex Algeria. American New Jersey Standard Oil entered the Sahara under such a background.
    However, the wishful thinking of French or other countries' monopoly capital groups to plunder Saharan oil will ultimately prove to be just a fantasy. As "L'Humanité" pointed out in its commentary on the "Oil Law," when Algeria and Black Africa are striving to end colonialist plunder, France's practice of privately handling the property of its master behind his back can only arouse the legitimate anger of the people in these places, thereby undermining France's opportunity to utilize the rich resources of the Sahara on a truly equal and mutually beneficial basis in the future.

    撒哈拉石油争夺战
     1月21日美国新泽西美孚油公司和法兰西石油公司以及佩特罗帕尔公司（法国政府的投资集团）签订协议，新泽西美孚油公司将在撒哈尔东大埃尔格地区占地两万平方公里的土地上进行为期五年的勘探。据英国“金融时报”消息，在由上述三个公司组成的合营公司里，新泽西美孚油公司将分得利润的一半，法兰西石油公司和佩特罗帕尔公司将分别分得利润的35％和15％。
    新泽西美孚油公司是洛克菲勒家族所控制的美国最大的一家石油公司。杜勒斯曾经担任过它的法律顾问。新泽西美孚油公司的打进撒哈拉，标志着国际石油垄断资本集团围绕撒哈拉石油资源进行的争夺战已经进入了一个新的阶段。
    国际石油垄断资本争夺本来属于非洲人民的撒哈拉财富由来已久。五十年代初期，法国垄断资本先后失去了在叙利亚、黎巴嫩和印度支那的地盘，又在摩洛哥、突尼斯遭受美国人的排挤，便积极在撒哈拉寻找新的原料来源。1956年，法国在撒哈拉发现了两个大油田，一个在哈西迈塞乌德，一个在同利比亚交界的埃杰莱。
    法国垄断资本集团在阿尔及利亚的哈西迈塞乌德地区建立油井。开采出来的石油通过一条口径六英寸的小型油管流往铁路线上的图古尔特，再用火车运往地中海海岸的菲利普维尔港。到1958年年底，已经运出了约四十万吨石油。修建从哈西迈塞乌德—菩给输油管的全部测量工作也已经完毕，现在铺管工作正以每天二英里的速度在沙漠上前进，预料1959年年底首次通过这个油管的石油就可以到达法国。估计撒哈拉石油蕴藏量约为全世界已知的蕴藏量的六分之一。法国极端缺乏石油，1958年法国消费了二千七百万吨石油，价值三亿一千万美元，其中有二亿九千万美元是用外汇付的。法国计划于1959年在撒哈拉开采一百七十万吨石油，1960年八百七十万吨，1963年二千万吨。
    闯进撒哈拉的，除了法国垄断资本控制的四十个公司和几家最大的银行以外，还有英国的石油垄断组织英荷壳牌石油公司、不列颠石油公司和西德、意大利的几家公司。
    长期以来，美国垄断资本对撒哈拉的富源也是垂涎欲滴。美国石油垄断集团深知，如果让撒哈拉石油完全掌握在法国和英国资本手里，美国人因销售中东石油而赚取的大量利润就要受到严重打击。早在六年以前，美国德士古石油公司急欲染指撒哈拉石油，当时遭到法国的拒绝。但是，由于法国政府执行着企图依靠美国维护殖民统治的政策，因此就不得不屈服在美国垄断资本家的压力下。两年以来，参加开发撒哈拉的“独立的”美国石油公司已达六、七个之多。
    戴高乐上台以后，一方面于1958年10月提出了法国垄断资本掠夺撒哈拉的总纲领——所谓开发阿尔及利亚计划，企图大量劫掠撒哈拉的财富来增加自己的地位；另方面又于1958年11月16日通过了所谓“石油法”，允许外国石油公司在把取得利润的一半分给法国政府的情况下，进入撒哈拉。戴高乐政府这样做，不仅是想在保证自己占优势的条件下，拉拢美、英、法、西德等国石油公司来合伙劫掠撒哈拉，而且也是企图通过让这些国家的石油公司分享一杯羹的办法，来影响这些国家的外交政策，使这些国家支持法国并吞阿尔及利亚的计划。美国新泽西美孚油公司就是在这样的背景下打入撒哈拉的。
    但是，无论是法国或者是其他国家的垄断资本集团劫掠撒哈拉石油的如意算盘，最后必然证明只能是幻想。正如“人道报”在评论“石油法”时所指出的，当阿尔及利亚和黑非洲力求结束殖民主义掠夺的时候，法国这种背着主人私下处理主人财产的做法，只能激起这些地方的人民正当的愤怒，从而损害以后法国真正在平等互利的基础上利用撒哈拉富源的机会。
