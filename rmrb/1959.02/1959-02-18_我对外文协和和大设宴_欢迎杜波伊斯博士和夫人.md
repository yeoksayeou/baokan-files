Xinhua News Agency, February 17th. The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace hosted a banquet tonight to welcome the renowned American Black scholar, member of the World Peace Council, Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois and his wife, Shirley Graham.

    Ding Xilin, in his welcoming speech on behalf of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, stated that Dr. Du Bois has made tremendous contributions over the decades to the struggle for world peace, against racial discrimination, and for the cause of human progress. Dr. Du Bois's achievements in culture and science are also well-known, and the Chinese people have always held Dr. Du Bois in high esteem and affection. We also clearly remember Dr. Du Bois's solemn condemnation of the U.S. government's open occupation of our territory of Taiwan. We thank Dr. Du Bois for his deep friendship with the Chinese people.

    Ding Xilin said that we also want to express our gratitude to Mrs. Du Bois. Not long ago, at the All-African People's Conference held in Accra, the so-called "national flag" of the Kuomintang was raised. It was Mrs. Du Bois who personally tore it down, preventing the U.S. attempt to create a "two Chinas" plot from succeeding. This righteous act is a great encouragement to us, to the Chinese people.

    In his speech, Dr. Du Bois said, "I cannot express how delighted I am to be able to attend this banquet. I believe you would not know how difficult it is for an American to know anything about China."

    He said, "I once had the opportunity to study at a very famous school in the United States, but after leaving that school, I knew nothing about China. I was very interested in learning about China, but all I heard were things that distorted the truth. I wanted to come to China a long time ago, but when I made up my mind to come to China, my country's government also made up its mind, so I could not come."

    Dr. Du Bois concluded by saying, "In 1936, I came to China and stayed for a week. This time I came to China, I have a wealth of knowledge and know how meaningful the existence of New China is not only for their own people, but also for the whole world."

    Mrs. Shirley Graham also expressed her joy at visiting China in her speech. She described the scene at the All-African People's Conference, where she and the wife of the American Black singer Paul Robeson personally tore down the so-called "national flag" of the Kuomintang. Her words drew waves of enthusiastic applause from the audience. She said that at the All-African People's Conference, visiting China was just a dream, and today this dream has become a reality. She also said that today, many people in the United States want to visit China.

    More than fifty well-known peace activists and scholars, professors, and writers, including Mao Dun, Zhang Xiruo, Liu Changsheng, Shi Liang, Li Dequan, Ji Chaoding, Wu Han, Meng Yongqian, and Tang Mingzhao, attended the banquet tonight. They toasted with the guests for the friendship between the Chinese and American people, for the friendship between the Chinese and African people, and for world peace.

    Many of those who attended the banquet tonight had been to the United States in the past. Their reunion with the American Black scholars in Beijing tonight made them especially happy. The writer Lao She sang a section of Peking Opera at the banquet, which drew continuous applause from the audience. After singing "Socialism is Good" loudly, Li Dequan composed and sang "Our Friends are All Over the World," which made everyone laugh. The ninety-one-year-old Dr. Du Bois could not suppress his inner excitement. He and his wife sang the American folk song "We Shall Study War No More" with great emotion. When they finished singing, many Chinese friends came forward to clink glasses with them, wishing them good health. At the end of the banquet, the hosts and guests toasted the American Black people together.

    American friends in Beijing were also invited to attend the banquet tonight.

    我对外文协和和大设宴    
    欢迎杜波伊斯博士和夫人
    新华社17日讯　中国人民对外文化协会和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会，今晚设宴欢迎美国著名黑人学者、世界和平理事会理事杜波伊斯博士和他的夫人歇莉·格雷姆。
    丁西林在代表中国人民对外文化协会和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会致欢迎词的时候说，杜波伊斯博士几十年来为争取世界和平，为反对种族歧视，为人类进步事业作出了巨大的贡献。杜波伊斯博士在文化科学上的成就也是尽人皆知的，中国人民一直对杜波伊斯博士怀着崇高的敬意与热爱。我们还清楚地记得杜波伊斯博士曾对美国政府公开侵占我国领土台湾表示严正的谴责。我们感谢杜波伊斯博士对中国人民深厚的友谊。
    丁西林说，我们也要向杜波伊斯夫人表示我们的感谢，不久之前，在阿克拉举行的全非人民大会，升起了国民党所谓的“国旗”，是杜波伊斯夫人亲手扯下了它，使美国企图制造“两个中国”的阴谋不能得逞。这种正义的行为，对于我们，对于中国人民，是一个很大的鼓舞。
    杜波伊斯博士在讲话中说，我不能表达能出席这次宴会我是多么高兴。我相信你们不会知道一个美国人能知道一些中国的事情是多么困难。
    他说，我曾经有一个机会在美国的一个很有名的学校读书，但我从那个学校里出来以后，我对中国的事情一无所知。我很有兴趣了解中国的事情，但我所听到的都是些颠倒黑白的事情。我很早以前就想到中国来，当我下了决心到中国来的时候，我的国家的政府也下了决心，所以我就不能够来。
    杜波伊斯博士最后说，1936年我到中国住了一个星期。这一次我到中国来，我已经具备了丰富的知识，知道了新中国的存在不仅对他们自己的人民多么有意义，而且对全世界是多么有意义。
    歇莉·格雷姆夫人在讲话中也同样表达了她访问中国的高兴心情。她描绘了在全非人民大会上，她同美国黑人歌唱家罗伯逊的夫人一起亲手扯下国民党所谓的“国旗”的情景。她的话博得全场一阵又一阵的热烈掌声。她说，在全非人民大会的时候，访问中国还只是一个梦想，今天这个梦想变成了现实。她又说，今天，在美国有许多人想访问中国。
    参加今晚宴会的，有著名的和平人士和学者、教授、作家茅盾、张奚若、刘长胜、史良、李德全、冀朝鼎、吴晗、孟用潜、唐明照等五十多人。他们同客人们一起为中国人民与美国人民的友谊、为中国人民与非洲人民的友谊、并为世界和平而干杯。
    参加今晚宴会的许多人过去都曾经到过美国，今晚在北京同美国黑人学者的团聚，使他们分外高兴。作家老舍在宴会上来了一段京剧清唱，引得大家掌声不止。李德全在高歌了“社会主义好”以后，又自编自唱了“我们的朋友遍布全世界”，逗得大家笑声满堂。九十一岁的杜波伊斯博士也按捺不住内心的兴奋，他和他的夫人一起感情充沛地合唱了“我们再不留恋战争”这支美国民歌。当他们演唱结束的时候，许多中国朋友上前同他们碰杯，祝他们身体健康。在宴会结束的时候，宾主又一起为美国黑人干杯。
    今晚，在北京的美国朋友也应邀出席了宴会。
