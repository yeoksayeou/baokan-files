Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 1st: Farmers in Zhejiang Province, who possess abundant experience in fertilization, are now diligently and meticulously cultivating green manure with great enthusiasm. Currently, the province's more than 8.9 million mu of green manure crops generally stand at three to four inches tall and are growing uniformly and completely. According to experienced farmers, this year's green manure is better than in previous years.

Zhejiang Province's green manure crops include purple alfalfa, alfalfa, and vetch. They serve not only as excellent base fertilizer for paddy fields but also as good feed for pigs. The use of green manure for pig farming has a history of a hundred years in the Jinhua and Ningbo regions. Farmers say, "Three mu of green manure for one pig, and the manure from one pig fertilizes three mu of land," which is the method of "raising pigs with fields and fertilizing fields with pig manure." Zhejiang Province's green manure production has increased year by year. In the early days after liberation, the average yield of fresh green manure was about 800 jin per mu. By 1957, it had increased to around 2,000 jin per mu, more than doubling the early post-liberation figure. In 1958, the average yield per unit reached 4,500 jin, more than doubling again compared to 1957. Since last winter, cultivating green manure, along with accumulating massive amounts of native miscellaneous fertilizers and promoting soil-based fertilizers, has been regarded as one of the three major forces in Zhejiang Province's fertilizer accumulation and production campaign. The province aims to achieve a green manure yield of 10,000 jin per mu, which is the goal for this year's green manure production.

Timely sowing, rational close planting, ditching and drainage, rational application of fertilizers, frost prevention and warmth preservation, and ensuring full seedling emergence are the experiences of Zhejiang farmers in planting and cultivating green manure. These experiences have now been widely promoted. Last winter, the province's green manure sowing was five to ten days earlier than in 1957, and the sowing quantity was also more than doubled compared to previous years, greatly increasing the planting density. Various localities have paid attention to ditching, fertilizing, and eliminating backward seedlings. In many people's communes in Shaoxing, Shengxian, and Pingyang, the green manure fields have achieved deep and level ditches that are interconnected and easy to drain. In Changhua County, more than 10,000 people participate in fertilizing and watering green manure fields every day. Some areas, through field inspections and plot-by-plot assessments, have promptly proposed specific measures to strengthen the cultivation of poorly growing green manure fields. The Liuliang People's Commune in Tongxiang County has also established specialized teams for grass seed cultivation, with division of labor and contracted responsibilities, resulting in high enthusiasm.

In recent months, Zhejiang Province has frequently experienced cold air intrusions. Various localities have launched mass frost prevention and seedling protection campaigns, with approximately one million farmers participating in this campaign every day. A large number of cadres from leadership departments at all levels have also gone deep into the fields to participate in frost prevention and warmth preservation work. In some areas, green manure fields are covered with straw, grass ash, and garbage; some areas have built windbreaks for green manure fields; some areas have increased fertilizer application in green manure fields; and some areas have repaired drainage ditches and strengthened drainage work. In Xiangshan County, all communes have established frost prevention headquarters, and production brigades have established frost prevention committees or groups. Commune members have actively taken action. In the first two days of January alone, 320,000 mu of green manure had been drained, and more than 120,000 mu had been fertilized. In Huangyan County, the Xinqiao People's Commune applied the fourth round of fertilizer to more than 11,000 mu of green manure during frost prevention.

The CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee and the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Department attach great importance to the cultivation of green manure fields. The Provincial Committee recently listed strengthening the cultivation of green manure as one of the main projects in the current fertilizer accumulation and production campaign at a telephone conference of secretaries of various localities, cities, and counties, and proposed replanting one to two million mu of spring green manure and extensively planting revolutionary grass and other aquatic green manure. Various localities, cities, and county committees also emphasized the importance of doing a good job in green manure at meetings related to the cultivation of spring-flowering crops. (Li Xinmin)

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 1st: Hunan Province, which has a habit of planting green manure, is adopting the method of "using small fertilizers to nourish large fertilizers" while carrying out the fertilizer accumulation campaign, to strengthen the field cultivation and management of green manure and increase green manure production. At present, more than 14 million mu of green manure in the province has mostly been ditched and drained, and some green manure fields have also been fertilized one or two times with "warming fertilizers," generally applying one to two dozen dan of fertilizers such as plant ash and pig and cattle manure per mu. Now, most of the green manure is growing well, a lush green.

Green manure is an organic fertilizer that requires little labor and has high fertilizer efficiency. According to scientific analysis, green manure crops such as red clover seeds and Man Yuan Hua (a local green manure plant), in addition to containing a large amount of organic matter, generally contain more than four jin of nitrogen per thousand jin, equivalent to twenty-six jin of ammonium sulfate, and also contain phosphorus and potassium fertilizer components. At the same time, green manure has rhizobia, which can fix free nitrogen in the air, and also has the effect of improving the soil. According to the experience of veteran farmers, generally one mu of green manure can fertilize one mu of paddy field. Green manure with a yield of more than 10,000 jin per mu can fertilize two to three mu of land. Cultivating one mu of green manure only requires five or six workdays, making it the most economical and inexpensive good fertilizer.

Last winter, the green manure sown in Hunan increased from 10 million mu sown in the winter of 1957 to more than 14 million mu. However, due to the winter drought last year and the neglect of cultivation and management of green manure in some areas, some green manure seedlings emerged unevenly and did not grow well enough. Recently, Party committees at all levels, through field inspections, mobilized the masses to topdress and cultivate. Initially, some cadres and masses had resistance, believing that "green manure is just grass, and there is no need to cultivate it," and some even put forward the argument that "topdressing green manure is not cost-effective." Many places, through airing views and debates, and comparative accounting, broke down conservative thinking and strengthened green manure cultivation work. When the Tiaoma Jian People's Commune in Changsha County mobilized commune members to topdress in the green manure fields in early January, they launched a major debate on "whether green manure needs to be cultivated." They calculated three accounts: one was the fertilizer account required for the Great Leap Forward this year; the second was the labor gain and loss account. They calculated that cultivating one mu of green manure now only requires two or three workdays, and green manure can yield 10,000 jin per mu, which is equivalent to more than 1,000 dan of high-quality native fertilizer. Accumulating more than 1,000 dan of high-quality native fertilizer requires more than 100 workdays. The third was the fertilizer gain and loss account. According to last year's experience, topdressing green manure can increase production by more than threefold. Applying one dan of fertilizer now can be exchanged for three dan of fertilizer in the spring. Through comparative accounting, everyone's minds became clear. The entire commune mobilized more than 5,000 people, established 225 specialized green manure cultivation teams, and adopted the method of dividing sections and blocks, assigning tasks to individuals, and contracting responsibilities. In five days, the entire commune topdressed more than 30,000 mu of green manure with about ten dan of fertilizer per mu. Now, more than 6,000 mu of green manure in the entire commune has generally upgraded from third-class seedlings and is growing well. In mid-December last year, Lixian County mobilized more than 20,000 people to apply an average of more than 20 dan of fertilizer per mu in 270,000 mu of green manure fields. At present, the people's communes in this county are generally combining the cultivation of spring-harvest crops, and adopting the "six fixings" method of fixing leaders, fixing plots, fixing personnel, fixing quality, fixing output, and fixing rewards, to process and cultivate green manure, striving for a green manure yield of 10,000 jin per mu.

    向绿色肥库索取粮棉
    浙江百万人精心培育绿肥田
    湖南以小肥养大肥争取高产
    本报杭州1日电　具有丰富育肥经验的浙江省农民，正在充满干劲，精心地培育绿肥。现在，全省八百九十多万亩绿肥作物，一般都长到三至四寸，而且生长齐全均匀。据老农谈，今年绿肥胜过往年。
    浙江省的绿肥作物，有紫云英、苜蓿、苕子等，它不仅是水稻田的好基肥，而且又是生猪的良好饲料，金华、宁波地区利用绿肥喂猪已有一百年历史。农民说：“三亩绿肥一头猪，一头猪粪三亩田”，这就是“以田养猪、猪粪肥田”的办法。浙江省绿肥产量逐年提高，解放初期平均每亩绿肥产鲜草约八百斤，到1957年提高到亩产两千斤上下，比解放初期增加一倍半；1958年的单位平均产量达到四千五百斤，又比1957年翻了一番以上。去冬以来，培育绿肥已和大积土杂肥、大搞土化肥被称为浙江省积肥造肥运动中的三路大军之一。全省争取亩产绿肥一万斤，是今年绿肥生产的努力目标。
    适时播种，合理密植，开沟排水，合理增施肥料，防冻保暖，保证全苗，这是浙江农民种植和培育绿肥的经验，这些经验现在已经普遍推广。去年冬季全省播种绿肥比1957年提早五天到十天，播种量也比往年提高一倍以上，密植程度大大增加了。各地都注意了开沟、施肥、消灭落后苗等工作。绍兴、嵊县、平阳等地不少人民公社的绿肥田，做到了沟深底平，沟沟相通，排水容易。昌化县每天有一万多人参加绿肥田施肥浇水。有些地区通过田间检查，丘丘作鉴定，对生长较差的绿肥田，及时提出具体措施，加强培育。桐乡县留良人民公社还建立了草子培育专业队，分工包干，干劲很高。
    近月来，浙江省经常有冷空气侵入，各地开展了群众性的防冻护苗运动，每天大约有一百万以上的农民投入这一运动，各级领导部门也有大批干部深入田头，参加防冻保暖工作。有些地区的绿肥田盖上稻草、草灰、垃圾；有些地区为绿肥田搭防风棚；有些地区在绿肥田增施肥料；有些地区修通排水沟，加强排水工作。象山县各公社都建立了防冻指挥部，大队成立防冻委员会或小组，社员们纷纷行动起来，仅在1月初的两天内，就有三十二万亩绿肥已经排水，十二万多亩加施肥料。黄岩县新桥人民公社在防冻中，把一万一千多亩绿肥施上了第四遍肥料。
    中共浙江省委和浙江省农业部门极为重视绿肥田的培育工作。省委最近在各地、市、县委书记电话会议上，把加强培育绿肥列为当前积肥造肥运动中的主要项目之一，并提出再播一、二百万亩春绿肥，大种革命草等水生绿肥。各地、市、县委，在有关春花作物培育的会议上，也强调搞好绿肥。（李新民）
    本报长沙1日电　有种绿肥习惯的湖南省，在开展积肥运动的同时，采取“以小肥养大肥”的办法，加强绿肥的田间培育管理工作，以提高绿肥产量。目前，全省一千四百多万亩绿肥，大部分进行了开沟排水，有一部分绿肥田还施了一、两次“保温肥”，一般每亩施草木灰、猪牛粪等肥料一、二十担。现在，大部分绿肥生长良好，一片嫩绿。
    绿肥，是一种花工少、肥效高的有机质肥料。据科学化验分析，红花草子、满园花等绿肥作物，除含大量有机质外，一般每一千斤含氮素四斤多，可抵二十六斤硫酸铵，还含有磷、钾素肥份。同时，绿肥有根瘤菌，能固定空中游离氮素，还有改良土壤的作用。根据老农的经验，一般一亩绿肥可以肥一亩稻田，绿肥亩产万斤以上的，可以肥两、三亩田；而培育好一亩绿肥，只需五、六个工，是最为经济便宜的好肥料。
    去冬湖南播种的绿肥，由1957年冬播一千万亩扩大到一千四百多万亩。但由于去年冬旱和有些地区忽视对绿肥的培育管理，因此有一部分绿肥出苗不齐、生长不够好。最近，各级党委通过田间检查，发动群众追肥培育。开始有些干部、群众曾有抵触情绪，他们认为“绿肥是把草，培育不用搞”，也有些人提出“绿肥追肥不合算”的论调。许多地方通过鸣放辩论、对比算账，大破保守思想，加强了绿肥培育工作。长沙县跳马涧人民公社在1月上旬发动社员在绿肥田里追肥时，就开展了一场“绿肥要不要培育”的大辩论，他们算了三笔账：一笔是今年大跃进所需肥料账；第二笔是劳力得失账：他们计算，现在培育好一亩绿肥，只要两、三个工；而绿肥能亩产万斤，可抵得一千多担优质土肥，积一千多担优质土肥，要一百多个工；第三笔是肥料得失账：他们根据去年经验，绿肥追肥可增产三倍以上，现在追一担肥，春天可以换回三担肥。通过对比算账，大家心里明亮了，全社出动五千多人，成立二百二十五个培育绿肥专业队，采取分段划块、任务到人、包干负责的办法，五天中全公社三万多亩绿肥每亩追肥十担左右。现在，全公社六千多亩绿肥三类苗普遍升了级，生长良好。澧县在去年12月中旬，出动二万多人，在二十七万多亩绿肥田中平均每亩追肥二十多担。目前，这个县的人民公社普遍结合培育春收作物，采取定领导、定地段、定专人、定质量、定产量、定奖励的“六定”办法，加工培育绿肥，争取绿肥亩产万斤。　　（胡坚）（附图片）
