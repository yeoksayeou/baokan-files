    The Masses Love Land-Based National Defense Sports

In recent years, with the development of the entire sports industry, land-based sports, one of the national defense sports projects, has also developed greatly and has been welcomed by the broad masses. Through various land sports activities, thousands of young people have learned some basic national defense knowledge and skills.

Shooting is the most widespread activity in land sports. Shooting activities began in 1952, and many students, workers, and cadres actively participated in this activity. In the past few years, shooting sports have developed rapidly. Many cities across the country have established shooting clubs, and many factories, schools, and institutions have established shooting groups, shooting teams, shooting work groups, and other organizations to carry out mass shooting activities. By 1957, more than 600,000 people across the country had participated in shooting activities. Last year, militia organizations were generally established throughout the country, and the vast majority of militiamen participated in this activity. Shooting has become one of the most popular sports.

Motorcycle and radio sports have also developed considerably in recent years. Motorcycle sports include internal combustion engine research, motorcycles, automobiles, tractors, and automobile models. More than 100 motorcycle clubs and more than 10,000 grassroots activity centers have been established in more than 20 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country. In radio activities, the main projects carried out in our country are engineering and radio operation. At present, 29 cities have established radio clubs of varying sizes. These clubs unite thousands of amateur motorcyclists and amateur radio enthusiasts around them.

Military camping activities have attracted a large number of young people. In 1957, more than 60 cities across the country organized more than 100,000 young people to participate in summer and winter military camping. Last year, inspired by the great leap forward situation across the country, 97 cities and more than 200 counties across the country organized military camping, with more than 1.4 million young people participating. Many young students, workers, and cadres received comprehensive military training during the camping period; at the same time, they increased a lot of military knowledge through visits, listening to reports, discussions, and practical operations.

Due to the increasingly widespread development of land sports, the level of sports has also greatly improved in recent years. In particular, shooting and radio sports have achieved good results in both domestic and international competitions, and many outstanding athletes have emerged. For example, in shooting, in 1955, our shooters won a total of three team second places and five team third places in competitions with many excellent shooters from eight countries. In radio, in 1956 and 1958, our radio athletes won the first place in the overall score of the international radio telegraphy competition twice. In this international telegraphy competition held in 1958, our delegation won the championships in all four collective events and five individual championships in six individual events. Outstanding athletes Wang Zuyan, Wei Shixian, Liang Zuocai, Wang Jinwu, Huang Chunzhuang, Zhu Wanqin, and Wu Liqing have created the highest scores in international competitions in machine copying, manual copying, and digital sending competitions, respectively.

    群众喜爱国防体育的陆上运动
    几年来，随着整个体育事业的发展，国防体育项目之一的陆上运动也有很大的开展，并受到广大群众的欢迎。通过陆上运动的各种活动，成千上万的青少年学到了一些初步的国防知识和技术。
    射击是陆上运动中开展得最广泛的一项活动。1952年开始开展射击活动，很多学生、工人、干部都积极参加了这项活动。几年来，射击运动发展很快，全国很多城市成立了射击俱乐部，很多工厂、学校和机关成立了射击小组、射击运动队、射击工作组等组织，开展群众性射击活动。到1957年全国已有六十多万人参加射击活动。去年，全国各地普遍建立了民兵组织，绝大多数民兵都参加了这项活动。射击成了最有群众性的运动项目之一。
    摩托和无线电运动几年来也有不小的发展。摩托运动包括内燃机研究、摩托车、汽车、拖拉机和汽车模型等活动。全国二十多个省、市、自治区建立了一百多所摩托俱乐部和一万多个基层活动据点。无线电活动，在我国开展的项目主要是工程和报务。目前，有二十九个城市建立了不同规模的无线电俱乐部。这些俱乐部把成千上万的业余摩托手和业余无线电爱好者，团结在它们的周围。
    军事野营活动吸引了广大青少年。1957年全国六十多个城市组织了十多万青年参加了夏冬季军事野营。去年，在全国大跃进形势的鼓舞下，全国有九十七个市、二百多个县都组织了军事野营，有一百四十多万青年参加。很多青年学生、工人和干部在野营期间，受到了综合性的军事训练；同时通过参观、听报告、座谈和实际操作等活动增进了不少的军事知识。
    由于陆上运动日益广泛开展，几年来运动水平也有很大提高。特别是射击和无线电运动，无论在国内和国际比赛中，都取得很好的成绩，并涌现了不少优秀运动员。例如：在射击方面，1955年我国射手在和八个国家许多优秀射手比赛中，我们一共获得三个团体第二名和五个团体第三名。在无线电方面，1956年和1958年我国无线电运动员先后两次取得国际无线电收发报竞赛的总分第一名，在1958年举行的这次国际收发报比赛中，我国代表队获得竞赛的全部四个集体项目的冠军和六个个人项目中的五个个人冠军。优秀运动员王祖燕、魏诗娴、梁佐才、王金武、黄纯庄、朱婉琴和吴立清等在机抄、手抄和数码发报比赛中，曾分别创造了国际比赛的最高成绩。（附图片）
