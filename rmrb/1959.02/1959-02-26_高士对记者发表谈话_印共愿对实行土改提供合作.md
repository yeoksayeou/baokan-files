Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 24th. Indian Communist Party General Secretary Ajoy Ghosh announced today to reporters that the Indian Communist Party is willing to cooperate on land reform.

He also said that the Central Executive Committee of the Indian Communist Party will call on all parties and the broad masses to cooperate in order to realize the Indian National Congress's decisions on land reform and state-run grain trade. Ghosh said this when talking about the resolutions of the Indian National Congress's annual meeting held in Nagpur in January this year. He said, "Due to the progressive expression made by the National Congress at the Nagpur meeting, it is possible for democratic forces inside and outside the National Congress to join hands and take mass action to implement it."

Ghosh said that the Central Executive Committee meeting of the Indian Communist Party, which was held in Delhi from February 21, discussed the resolutions of the National Congress's Nagpur annual meeting and expressed agreement with the views in an article he recently published in the party's organ, the "New Age" weekly.

The National Congress's Nagpur annual meeting passed a resolution on the organizational form of agriculture, stipulating that the maximum limit for land ownership should be determined within the year, and that cooperatives of joint cultivation retaining farmers' land ownership should be gradually established as the future organizational form of agriculture.

Ghosh's article commenting on these resolutions said that the possibility of cooperation between progressive forces inside and outside the National Congress has increased. It said that in order to realize the National Congress's resolutions, the progressive forces within the National Congress "must not only wage a selfless struggle for certain principles, but also for specific policies and specific measures that can realize these principles. They must also join hands with democratic parties and democratic forces outside the National Congress to launch this struggle in order to gain the support of the masses."

The article said that this meeting was held in a situation where "foreign and Indian vested interest groups launched a coordinated offensive against all the progressive principles professed by the National Congress." He said, "It is certainly a good thing that Nehru and many representatives have shown that they understand the serious threat posed by the activities of vested interest groups to the public sector and the national economy." In this article, Ghosh also put forward criticisms and suggestions on the shortcomings in the resolutions of the National Congress annual meeting.

    印共愿对实行土改提供合作
    新华社新德里24日电　印度共产党总书记高士今天向新闻记者发表谈话时宣布，印度共产党愿意提供合作来进行土地改革。
    他还说，印度共产党中央执行委员会将呼吁一切党派和广大群众进行合作，以便使印度国大党关于土地改革和国营粮食贸易的决定得到实现。高士是在谈到印度国大党今年1月在那格浦尔召开的年会的决议时这样说的。他说，“由于国大党在那格浦尔会议上所作出的有进步意义的表示，国大党内外的民主力量有可能携手合作和采取群众性的行动来实行它。”
    高士说，从2月21日起在德里举行的印度共产党中央执行委员会会议讨论了国大党那格浦尔年会的决议，并且表示同意他最近在党的机关刊物“新世纪”周刊上发表的一篇文章中的观点。
    国大党那格浦尔年会通过了关于农业组织形式的决议，规定年内确定占有土地的最高限额，并且逐步建立保留农民的土地所有权的联合耕作的合作社，作为未来的农业组织形式。
    高士评论这些决议的文章说，国大党内外进步力量携手合作的可能性增加了。它说，为了实现国大党的决议，国大党内部的进步力量“不仅必须为某些原则，而且必须为一些能够实现这些原则的具体政策和具体措施，展开铁面无私的斗争。他们还必须同国大党以外的民主党派和民主力量携手合作来展开这一斗争，以便取得群众的支持。”
    文章说，这次会议是在“外国和印度的既得利益集团对国大党所表白的一切进步原则大力展开互相配合的攻势”的情况下举行的。他说，“尼赫鲁和许多代表表现出他们是了解既得利益集团的活动给予（国民经济）的公营部分和国民经济所造成的严重威胁的，这肯定是很好的事情。”高士在这篇文章中也对国大党年会决议中的缺点提出了批评和建议。
