Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 4th: In recent days, the tremendous labor enthusiasm and soaring patriotic feelings of the Soviet working people, inspired by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, are developing in a surging tide. Good news of completing labor gifts to the Congress is frequently reported from various places; the labor emulation drive celebrating the 21st Congress is in full swing; workers in factories, enterprises, and collective farms are holding meetings to express their feelings about the 21st Congress and their determination to fulfill the seven-year plan.

    Moscow construction workers completed the January housing construction plan ahead of schedule. They built more than 183,000 square meters of housing area, more than 30,000 square meters more than the original plan to greet the 21st Congress.

    Agricultural laborers throughout the country have begun intensive spring field work, preparing to widely adopt integrated mechanized farming. The agricultural laborers of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, who initiated the competition, are smoothly completing the task of organizing agricultural machinery in order to fulfill the task of a bumper harvest of maize.

    The working people of the Soviet Union are paying attention to the daily progress of the Congress with joy. People expressed their feelings at many mass rallies held in various places. At a rally held at the No. 3 Mine in the Lviv coal district, Socialist Labor Hero Chulkin expressed the feelings of all the workers. He said that it is difficult for us to express the joy that every word in Khrushchev's report brings us. We must go all out to victoriously complete the great seven-year plan. Our work team has decided to complete the seven-year task in five years.

    Thousands of letters and telegrams with the words "Presidium of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, Moscow Kremlin" are flying in like snowflakes. In a letter from members of the Michurin Collective Farm in the Gorky Oblast, they said that after discussing Khrushchev's report, we immediately decided to produce 105 quintals of meat per 100 hectares of agricultural land this year, which is twice as much as last year, and to complete the seven-year plan in four years. A letter signed Levonin said that although I am not a party member, if anyone asks me why I love the Communist Party, I will definitely answer that it is because the party relies on the working people in everything, because the party is correct, and I believe in the Communist Party as much as I believe in my own heart.

    党的代表大会鼓舞全民劳动热情
    苏联人民决心提前完成七年计划
    新华社莫斯科4日电　这几天，苏劳动人民被苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会鼓舞起来的巨大劳动热潮和高涨的爱国主义感情正在汹涌澎湃地发展着。各地完成向大会的劳动献礼的捷报频频传来；庆祝二十一大的劳动竞赛在热火朝天地进行；工厂、企业和集体农庄劳动者都举行集会，表达对二十一大的感想和完成七年计划的决心。
    莫斯科建筑工人提前完成了1月份住宅建设计划，他们建成了十八万三千多平方公尺的住宅面积，比原订迎接二十一大任务的计划，多建了三万多平方公尺。
    全国各地的农业劳动者已经开始了紧张的春季田间工作，准备广泛采用综合机械化耕作。竞赛发起者、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克州的农业劳动者为了完成玉蜀黍大丰收的任务，农业机器的整理工作正顺利完成中。
    苏联各地的劳动人民都以喜悦的心情注意着大会的每天进程。人们在各地举行的许多群众集会上，发表自己的感想。在利沃夫煤区第三号矿井举行的集会上，社会主义劳动英雄丘尔金说出了所有劳动者的心情，他说，我们很难表达赫鲁晓夫报告中每一句话使我们产生的愉快，我们一定要全力以赴，胜利完成伟大的七年计划。我们工作队已决定五年完成七年任务。
    数以千计的写着：“莫斯科克里姆林宫苏共二十一大主席团”字样的信件和电报雪片似的飞来。在高尔基州米丘林集体农庄庄员们的来信中说，我们讨论了赫鲁晓夫报告后，立刻决定要在今年在每一百公顷农业用地上生产一百零五公担肉类，即比去年多一倍，要四年完成七年计划。一位署名列沃宁的来信中说，我虽然不是党员，但如有人问我为什么热爱共产党，我一定回答说，因为党在一切事情中都依靠劳动人民，因为党是正确的，我相信共产党正像相信自己的心一样。
