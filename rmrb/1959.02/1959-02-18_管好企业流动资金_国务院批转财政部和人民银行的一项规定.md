Xinhua News Agency, February 17th: The State Council approved and forwarded the supplementary regulations of the Ministry of Finance and the Head Office of the People's Bank of China on the unified management of working capital of state-owned enterprises by the People's Bank of China on February 3, 1959, requiring all regions to implement them.

In its instructions, the State Council stated: Although the working capital of state-owned enterprises is uniformly managed by the People's Bank of China, this does not mean that the financial departments and enterprise management departments can ignore it and reduce their responsibilities in the management of working capital. Managing working capital well is a major matter. In the future, the work of verifying the fixed amount of working capital for enterprises, examining and approving the working capital plans of enterprises, and strengthening the management and inspection of working capital of enterprises must be the responsibility of the financial departments, in coordination with the enterprise management departments and the People's Bank of China, to be done well.

The State Council pointed out that the change in the management method of working capital is to adapt to the situation of high-speed development of socialist construction, to facilitate the timely guarantee of the needs of enterprise working capital, and to overcome the complicated procedures and certain disconnects caused by the past supply of funds separately by the financial departments and banks. It is not intended to reduce the state's financial expenditure on working capital. In the future, the fixed amount of working capital that state-owned enterprises need to increase will still be appropriately arranged by the financial departments at all levels from the annual budget and handed over to the local People's Bank of China for unified lending. It is incorrect to not arrange necessary working capital expenditures in the annual budget, or even to withdraw the enterprise's original own working capital for other financial expenditures, which is inconsistent with the original intention of changing the management method of working capital.

Finally, the State Council requested all enterprises to ensure the integrity of the own working capital allocated by the state and to transfer the own working capital allocated by the state to the People's Bank of China as loans in full. If the working capital of the enterprise is transferred for basic construction and other purposes, it should be made up, and the enterprise's statutory fund should not be reduced, and the state's working capital should not be reduced.

In order to correctly implement the "Regulations of the State Council on Several Issues in the Work of Credit Cooperatives of People's Communes and the Working Capital of State-owned Enterprises" on December 20, 1958, the Ministry of Finance and the Head Office of the People's Bank of China made "Supplementary Regulations on the Unified Management of Working Capital of State-owned Enterprises by the People's Bank of China." The main contents of these supplementary regulations are:

1.  The scope of application of the new method is: state-owned enterprises and local state-owned enterprises (including enterprises belonging to industrial, commercial, transportation, postal and telecommunications, agricultural, cultural and educational, health, public security and other departments), and handicraft production cooperatives that have been converted to local state-owned enterprises, etc. All the own funds allocated by the state to these departments in the past will be transferred to the People's Bank of China as loans. From 1959 onwards, the required working capital will be uniformly supplied by the People's Bank of China in the form of credit and will be uniformly managed.

2.  If the enterprise's own working capital is transferred for basic construction or other purposes, it should be cleaned up and made up, and the enterprise's statutory fund should not be reduced, and the state's working capital should not be reduced.

The finance departments (bureaus) and branches of the People's Bank of China in each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government should report the enterprise's clean-up situation and transfer figures to the people's committees, the Ministry of Finance, and the Head Office of the People's Bank of China in each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government.

3.  From 1959 onwards, the financial departments at all levels should include the fixed amount of working capital that enterprises need to increase in the budget and allocate it to the local People's Bank of China in full as a credit fund. When the financial departments at all levels increase the working capital in the annual budget, they should jointly arrange with the planning departments, the People's Bank of China and other relevant departments according to the relevant indicators of the national economic plan.

During the implementation of the annual plan, when the amount of working capital required exceeds the annual plan due to increased production and expanded commodity circulation, the central budget will solve the problem for central enterprises, and the local budget will solve the problem for local enterprises.

4.  The enterprise management departments should report the annual working capital plan to the financial departments and the People's Bank of China, which will be jointly reviewed and approved by the financial departments and the bank as the basis for assessing the capital turnover of the enterprise management departments.

The enterprise management departments should put forward measures to accelerate the turnover of funds, issue capital turnover indicators, and strengthen the assessment and inspection of the enterprise's capital utilization according to the state's requirements for accelerating capital turnover and the enterprise's capital turnover in the previous year.

5.  The enterprise should, according to the working capital turnover indicators issued by the competent department and its own business conditions, prepare annual and quarterly working capital plans with the participation of the local People's Bank of China, and submit them to the higher-level competent department and the local People's Bank of China.

6.  The working capital borrowed by the enterprise from the bank can only be used for the needs of production turnover and commodity circulation, and must not be used for basic construction and other purposes. Except for special approval, enterprises shall not prepay loans or conduct commodity sales on credit.

7.  The own working capital of enterprises managed by rural people's communes should also be transferred to the local People's Bank of China and uniformly used as loans from the bank to the commune's credit cooperatives, which will then be loaned to the enterprises for use.

The management methods for the working capital of rural people's communes' self-run enterprises shall be formulated and implemented by each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the central government in accordance with the spirit of the "Regulations of the State Council on Several Issues in the Work of Credit Cooperatives of People's Communes and the Working Capital of State-owned Enterprises."

8.  The management methods for the working capital of basic construction units and construction contracting enterprises shall be formulated separately by the Ministry of Finance according to the principle of investment contracting.

    管好企业流动资金
    国务院批转财政部和人民银行的一项规定
    新华社17日讯　国务院于1959年2月3日，批准并转发了财政部和人民银行总行关于国营企业流动资金改由人民银行统一管理的补充规定，要求各地贯彻执行。
    国务院在批示中说：国营企业的流动资金，虽然一律改由人民银行统一管理，但这并不能认为，财政部门和企业主管部门可以放手不管，可以减轻自己在流动资金管理上的责任。管好流动资金是一件大事，今后关于核定企业的定额流动资金，审定企业的流动资金计划，加强企业流动资金的管理和检查，必须由财政部门为主，协同企业主管部门和人民银行分工负责，才能做好。
    国务院指出，流动资金管理办法的改变，是为了适应社会主义建设高速度发展的形势，便于及时地保证企业流动资金的需要，克服过去分别由财政和银行供应资金所产生的手续繁复和某些脱节现象，而不是为了减少国家财政在流动资金方面应有的开支，今后国营企业需要增加的定额流动资金仍然由各级财政部门从年度预算中适当加以安排，交当地人民银行统一贷放。在年度预算中不安排必要的流动资金支出，甚至把企业原有的自有流动资金抽回用作其他财政开支，都是同改变流动资金管理办法的原意不符合的，因而是不正确的。
    最后，国务院要求各企业，保证国家拨给的自有流动资金完整无缺，并把国家拨给企业的自有流动资金，如数转作人民银行的贷款，抽调企业流动资金用于基本建设和其它用途的，应当设法补足，不得冲减企业的法定基金，不得减少国家的流动资金。
    财政部和人民银行总行为了正确执行1958年12月20日“国务院关于人民公社信用部工作中几个问题和国营企业流动资金问题的规定”，作了“关于国营企业流动资金改由人民银行统一管理的补充规定”，这个补充规定的主要内容是：
    1、新办法的适用范围是：国营企业和地方国营企业（包括工业、商业、交通运输、邮电、农业、文教、卫生、公安等部门所属企业）、手工业生产合作社已经转为地方国营的企业等。这些部门过去国家财政拨给的自有资金，全部转作人民银行的贷款，今后需要的流动资金，自1959年起一律改由人民银行按信贷方式统一供应，并且进行统一管理。
    2、抽调企业自有流动资金用于基本建设或其他用途的，应当进行清理，并且设法补足，不得冲减企业法定基金，不得减少国家的流动资金。
    各省、自治区、直辖市财政厅（局）和人民银行分行，应当将企业清理情况及转账数字，报告各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会、财政部和人民银行总行。
    3、自1959年起，各级财政部门应当将企业需要增加的定额流动资金列入预算，并且全额拨交当地人民银行作为信贷基金。各级财政部门在年度预算中增列流动资金的时候，应当会同计划部门、人民银行和其他有关部门，根据国民经济计划的有关指标，统一安排。
    在年度计划执行当中，由于生产增加和商品流转扩大，流动资金需要额超过年度计划的时候，属于中央企业的由中央预算解决，属于地方企业的由地方预算解决。
    4、企业主管部门应当向财政部门和人民银行编报年度流动资金计划，由财政部门和银行共同审定，作为考核企业主管部门资金周转的依据。
    企业主管部门应当根据国家加速资金周转的要求和企业上年流动资金的周转情况，提出加速资金周转的措施，颁发资金周转指标，并且加强对企业资金运用情况的考核和检查。
    5、企业应当根据主管部门颁发的流动资金周转指标和自己的业务经营状况，在当地人民银行参加下，编制年度和季度的流动资金计划，报送上级主管部门和当地人民银行。
    6、企业向银行所借的流动资金，只能用于生产周转和商品流转的需要，不得用于基本建设和其他用途。除了特别批准的以外，企业不得预付贷款，也不得进行商品赊销。
    7、国家下放给农村人民公社管理的企业，其自有流动资金也应该划转当地人民银行，统一作为银行对公社信用部的贷款，由公社信用部再贷给企业使用。
    农村人民公社自办企业的流动资金管理办法，由各省、自治区、直辖市根据“国务院关于人民公社信用部工作中几个问题和国营企业流动资金问题的规定”的精神自行规定实施。
    8、基本建设单位和建筑包工企业的流动资金管理办法，根据投资包干的原则由财政部另行制订。
