    Quotations on the Relationship Between Class and Division of Labor
    The greatest division of material and mental labor is the separation of town and country. The antagonism between town and country begins with the transition from barbarism to civilization, from the tribal system to the state…
    With the emergence of cities, there is a need for administrative organs, police, taxes, etc.… Here, the residents are first divided into two major classes, a division directly caused by the division of labor and the tools of production.
                   (Marx & Engels: "The German Ideology")
    In patriarchal, caste, feudal, and guild systems, the division of labor in the entire society is carried out according to certain rules. Are these rules determined by some legislator? No. They originally came from the material conditions of production and only became laws after a long time. It is in this way that these different forms of division of labor became the basis of different social organizations.
                              (Marx: "The Poverty of Philosophy")
    When the productivity of human labor is still so small that it can only provide a small surplus beyond the necessary means of subsistence—at that time, the improvement of productivity, the expansion of exchange, the development of the state and law, the creation of art and science, all of these are only possible through a greater division of labor. The basis of this division of labor is the division between the masses engaged in simple manual labor and the privileged few who lead the work, manage commerce and affairs of state, and later engage in science and art. The simplest and most completely spontaneous form of this division is slavery.
                             　(Engels: "Anti-Dühring")
    From the initial large-scale social division of labor arose the initial great division of society into two major classes: masters and slaves, exploiters and exploited.
    (Engels: "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State")
    In this way, the division of society into different mutually antagonistic classes becomes superfluous; such a division is not only superfluous but even incompatible with the new social system. The existence of classes is caused by the division of labor. At that time, the present division of labor will also completely disappear, because to raise industrial and agricultural production to the above-mentioned level, it is not enough to rely on mechanical and chemical auxiliary tools alone; the ability of the people who use these tools must also be developed accordingly.
                             (Engels: "Principles of Communism")

    关于阶级和分工的关系的语录 
    物质劳动和精神劳动的最大的一次分工，就是城市和乡村的分离，城乡之间的对立是随着野蛮向文明的过渡，部落制度向国家的过渡……而产生的。
    随着城市的出现也就需要有行政机关、警察赋税等等……在这里居民第一次划分为两大阶级，这种划分是直接由分工和生产工具引起的。
                   （马克思、恩格斯：“德意志思想体系”）
    在宗法制度、种姓制度、封建制度和行会制度下，整个社会的分工都是按照一定的规则进行的。这些规则是由哪个立法者确定的吗？不是。它们最初来自物质生产条件，过了很久以后才上升为法律。分工的这些不同形式正是这样才成为不同的社会组织形式的基础。
                              （马克思：“哲学的贫困”）
    当人类劳动的生产性还是如此之小，它除了必需的生活资料以外，还只能提供微小的剩余的时候——在那样的时候，生产力的提高，交换的扩大，国家和法律的发展，艺术和科学的创造，所有这些，都只有通过更大的分工，才有可能。作为此种分工的基础是：从事于单纯体力劳动的群众，同领导工作、经营商业和经管国事，再后，更从事于科学及艺术的少数特权分子这两方面之间的分工。这种分工的最简单的完全自发形成的形式，就是奴隶制。　
                             　（恩格斯：“反杜林论”）
    从最初的大规模的社会分工之中，产生了社会的最初的大分裂，分成为两大阶级：即主人和奴隶，剥削者和被剥削者。
    （恩格斯：“家庭、私有制和国家的起源”）
    这么一来，社会划分为各个不同的相互敌对的阶级也就是多余的了；这种划分不仅是多余的，甚至是和新的社会制度互不相容的。阶级的存在是由分工引起的，到那时现在这种分工也将完全消失，因为要把工业和农业生产提高到上述的那种水平，单靠机械的和化学的辅助工具是不够的，还必须相应地发展运用这些工具的人的能力。
                             （恩格斯：“共产主义原理”）
