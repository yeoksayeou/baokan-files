Our congress is coming to a close. The discussions at the congress and during the preparations for it have shown that the entire party and the entire Soviet people unanimously support the Seven-Year Plan and are determined to fulfill it.

Eighty-six comrades spoke at the congress. Among them were representatives of various union republics, many autonomous republics, territories, and regions, outstanding workers and peasants, and representatives from the fields of science, technology, and culture.

All the speakers at the congress expressed their full agreement with the control figures submitted for discussion. They believe that the Seven-Year Plan reflects the Leninist general line of the party in the current stage of building communism in our country.

The congress marks the beginning of a period of comprehensive construction of a communist society. The work of the congress was characterized by a spirit of realism and concreteness.

Our congress vividly demonstrated the rock-solid unity of our party and the high level of activity of all party organizations and all communists. There is every reason to call the 21st Congress of the CPSU the congress of builders of communism, marking the beginning of a new historical period in the development of our country—the period of comprehensive construction of a communist society. The congress demonstrated the great creative power of Marxist-Leninist thought and its living, inseparable connection with the practice of the people building the radiant edifice of communism.

Many specific and highly valuable suggestions were made in the speeches at the congress. The implementation of these suggestions will make it possible to more fully utilize the inexhaustible potential of industry and agriculture and to fulfill and overfulfill the plan.

When I listened to the speeches of the delegates to the congress, I recalled Vladimir Ilyich Lenin's speech at the All-Russian Congress of Soviets on the discussion of the first national economic plan—the electrification of Russia. Lenin said: "I think that we are holding this congress at a very important turning point, which in any case proves that the Soviet government has begun to achieve great success. In the future, not only politicians and administrators, but also engineers and agronomists will appear on the rostrum of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets. This is the beginning of the happiest era... To truly turn to economic construction, the All-Russian Congress of Soviets must first set this tone and, from top to bottom, in all Soviets and organizations, in all newspapers, in all propaganda and agitation departments, in all institutions, set this tone... Do not turn the congresses and meetings into institutions of empty talk, but into institutions for checking economic achievements, into institutions where we can truly learn economic construction." (Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 31, pp. 481-482, Russian edition; p. 466, Chinese edition).

The party is acting according to the great Lenin's suggestion. The work of our congress was permeated with a spirit of realism and concreteness, with a spirit of creatively solving the mature problems of communist construction. Look how this had a good effect on the work of the congress, on raising the activity of millions of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals, and on improving their entire practical work.

We have accumulated rich experience in economic construction, and our party organizations have rapidly turned to solving the fundamental problems of domestic economic leadership and have achieved significant success. In solving the grandiose tasks of the Seven-Year Plan, Lenin's instructions that all our work should be realistic, concrete, and goal-oriented should serve as a guide for action for party organizations at all levels, from top to bottom, and as a guide for action for every collective of Soviet society laborers.

We listened attentively to the speeches of party, Soviet, economic, trade union, and Komsomol leaders, scientists, engineers, and agronomists, as well as to the brilliant speeches of advanced workers in industry and agriculture. They all spoke about the specific and important tasks facing our country.

Here, delegates such as Nikolai Yakovlevich Mamai, a famous miner from the Donetsk coal basin, Aleksandr Mikhailovna Rebakova, a turner from the Moscow Tire Factory, Vladimir Ivanovich Gorbunov, an assembler from the Leningrad Shipyard, Nikolai Ivanovich Anishenkov, a steelworker from the "Red Sormovo" Shipyard, Dmitry Ivanovich Barashkin, a worker from the Minsk Automobile Plant, and many others spoke. These were very meaningful and rich speeches! These speeches were imbued with rich professional knowledge and a sense of ownership, not only for the development of production in their own factories and mines, but also for the development of the entire country.

One can also mention the speeches of outstanding advanced agricultural producers such as Yevgeniya Alekseyevna Dolinyuk, Aleksandr Vasilyevich Gitalev, Pelageya Nikandrovna Kovaleva, Sergey Kuzmich Bako, Yevgeniya Ivanovna Andreeva, Terenty Semyonovich Martsev, and others. When they spoke about the work of their collective farms, they convincingly showed that with good management, such achievements can be attained; how great the potential of our collective farms and state farms is.

From this high rostrum, we also heard the speeches of our outstanding scientists, such as Academician Igor Vasilyevich Kurchatov, Academician Mikhail Alekseyevich Lavrentyev, President of the USSR Academy of Sciences Alexander Nikolaevich Nesmyanov, President of the Kazakh Academy of Sciences Kanysh Imantaevich Satpaev, the famous poet Alexander Trifonovich Tvardovsky, and other representatives of our glorious creative intelligentsia.

It was particularly impressive that when party and Soviet leaders spoke at the congress about the Seven-Year Plan, their speeches were filled with profound knowledge of industrial and agricultural production and, relying on the rich experience of the masses, concretely touched upon the ways to solve urgent tasks.

Advanced workers in industry and agriculture, representatives of the intelligentsia, party and Soviet workers—all the comrades who spoke at the congress confidently stated that the tasks of the seven-year period not only can be fulfilled but also can be overfulfilled.

From the rostrum of our party congress, we heard the powerful and confident voices of people from the depths of life and from among the masses, voices that understand and reflect the feelings, thoughts, and emotions of millions of people. This is pleasing and gratifying. These speeches indicate that the great upsurge of the Soviet people, who have actually begun to implement the grandiose tasks of the Seven-Year Plan, is underway. All this also indicates how much our cadres have grown, how broad the thinking of Soviet people is, how deeply they understand not only their specific business but also the life of the state.

As I have already said, during the discussion of the report on the control figures for the development of the national economy of the USSR for 1959-1965, many very valuable suggestions were made. The Central Committee of the party and the Council of Ministers of the USSR will consider the hopes and suggestions mentioned in the speeches at the congress. It is necessary to instruct the State Planning Commission, the republics, and other local bodies to carefully study the many specific suggestions made by the working people during the discussion of the control figures and to take measures to implement these suggestions.

Some delegates to the congress in their speeches condemned the phenomenon of drunkenness and raised the question of strengthening the struggle against this evil and preventing the production of moonshine. Those who produce moonshine not only waste sugar, grain, and other foodstuffs, not only engage in speculation, but also get weak-willed people drunk and poison their bodies, since moonshine contains a lot of fusel oil.

I think that the suggestion to strongly combat drunkenness and the production of moonshine is correct, and the congress supports the comrades who made these suggestions.

If the central committees of the communist parties and councils of ministers of the union republics paid more attention to this issue, worked out specific measures to stop the abuse of alcoholic beverages, to deal with those who produce moonshine, and to deal with those "chemists" who seriously harm people's health and disrupt social order, that would be good.

I think that each republic should draft a bill on this issue, submit it to the working people for discussion, and after discussing these bills, pass laws prescribing severe measures against those who abuse alcoholic beverages and disrupt social order, especially against those who produce moonshine. We are convinced that the working people of each republic will certainly support measures to strongly combat drunkenness and the production of moonshine.

Comrades! In these days, the entire country has been closely following the work of the congress. In all enterprises, construction sites, collective farms, state farms, and scientific institutions, mass meetings and conferences have been held, and the documents of the congress have been widely discussed. The 21st Congress received thousands of letters and telegrams, which not only expressed greetings but also reported on the specific work done to welcome the 21st Congress. "Pravda" published the names of labor collectives that sent greetings and telegrams to the party's 21st Congress and pledged to fulfill the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

On behalf of our congress, I express my heartfelt thanks to all the organizations and comrades who sent greetings and telegrams to the party's 21st Congress and wish them new successes in their labor for the benefit of the Motherland.

We believe that the all-people socialist competition for the fulfillment and overfulfillment of the Seven-Year Plan, which is now unfolding throughout the country, will take on an ever-wider scale and will end with new, outstanding labor victories.

Look, the sun has come out again, and it is shining brightly. It has accompanied the work of our congress from beginning to end. (Stormy applause)

The greetings from fraternal parties demonstrate the unity of the international communist movement. The Soviet Union will not spare its efforts to fulfill its internationalist duties.

Comrades! Seventy-two delegations from foreign communist and workers' parties attended our congress. Some fraternal parties that could not send representatives to our congress personally sent friendly greetings and telegrams to the congress.

The Marxist-Leninist fraternal parties, in their greetings and telegrams, expressed on behalf of the communists, the working class, and millions of laborers of their countries sincere friendship and unity of feelings to our party and the entire Soviet people. These greetings are filled with warm words, expressing the great trust and sincere feelings of the peoples of the socialist countries and the broad laboring masses, the defenders of peace, democracy, and world progress, towards our party and our country.

The delegations from the fraternal parties of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Albania, and the Mongolian People's Republic spoke about the brilliant achievements of their peoples in the construction of socialism under the leadership of the communist and workers' parties. This is gladdening news.

The comrades from the fraternal parties of the capitalist countries spoke here about the difficult and heroic struggle of the communists in these countries for the interests of the working class, for peace and the security of all peoples, for the happiness of all laborers.

The communist parties have established a tradition of sending delegations to each other's congresses. We will also adhere to this tradition in the future because it well expresses the spirit of unity and mutual support of the fraternal parties, the spirit of proletarian internationalism.

The greetings from the fraternal parties, the meetings of their representatives with the representatives of our congress and the working people of Moscow vividly demonstrated the unity, strength, and solidarity of the international communist movement based on Marxist-Leninist principles.

On behalf of our party congress and the Soviet people, I express my deepest gratitude to all the fraternal parties for their greetings and friendly wishes for their success. We also warmly congratulate all the fraternal communist and workers' parties on their achievements in their heroic struggle for peace and socialism.

Allow me to also express my thanks to the foreign social organizations, trade unions, and working people who sent greetings and telegrams to our party congress.

Dear guests from the fraternal communist and workers' parties! You have come to participate in our congress from all corners of the Earth. Please convey to the party members and the working people of your countries the sentiments of the 21st Congress of the CPSU: the communists and the entire people of the Soviet Union will highly value the fraternal feelings, friendship, and unity expressed in the greetings to our congress.

Our party and the Soviet people consider it their internationalist duty to constantly strengthen friendship and proletarian solidarity with the laboring people and democratic forces of the whole world, to strengthen the powerful socialist camp, and to constantly strive for international peace.

The communist party and the Soviet people consider the victorious fulfillment and overfulfillment of the new Seven-Year Plan to be their extremely important internationalist task.

Dear comrades, there can be no doubt that all communists and Soviet laborers will not spare their efforts to gloriously fulfill this historical task!

Comrades! The 21st Congress of the party has adopted a grandiose plan for peaceful creation. The work of the congress embodied the party's and the entire Soviet people's confidence in the implementation of the plan for the construction of communism, and the desire to do everything possible to maintain peace and ensure peaceful coexistence of states with different social systems. This is the most important feature of our congress. Even the supporters of the "cold war," if they objectively assess the situation, will see that the plans we are going to adopt are aimed at ensuring peaceful coexistence and strengthening the cause of world peace.

Comrade delegates! I am happy to inform you that at the construction site of the Bhilai steel plant in India (this plant is being built by the Indian government with the help of the Soviet Union), our Soviet specialists reported significant production achievements. On February 1, the first batch of coke was produced, and on February 3, the first batch of pig iron was produced. (Stormy applause) This large-scale steel plant is being built according to the Soviet design and under the leadership of our specialists.

It should be noted that, in addition to this plant being built with the help of the Soviet Union, there are two more plants under construction in India, one with the help of Britain and the other with the help of West Germany. Although the Bhilai steel plant started construction one and a half years later than the two plants built by British and West German companies, due to the close cooperation of our comrades with Indian specialists and workers, overcoming many difficulties, they were able to complete the first stage of this powerful modern steel plant in a shorter time than the British and Germans and produced the first batch of coke and pig iron. (Applause)

Let this first batch of pig iron be a symbol of the ever-strengthening friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and India! (Stormy applause)

Let all the intrigues and cunning of the imperialists be burned in the flames of this blast furnace, they who try to hinder the further development of Soviet-Indian friendship and our common struggle for the victory of the principles of peaceful coexistence! (Enduring applause)

Let the heat of this blast furnace warm the great friendship of the peace-loving peoples of our two countries! (Stormy applause)

Let our friendship be as strong as the metal smelted in this plant, built by the joint efforts of the peoples and governments of the Soviet Union and India! (Stormy applause)

We congratulate the people of India and the Indian government led by Prime Minister Nehru on their great production achievements of great significance in the industrialization of the country and the strengthening of economic independence. (Enduring applause)

We are pleased that President Prasad of the Indian Republic participated in the ceremony of the first stage of the metallurgical plant going into production and expressed good wishes for strengthening Soviet-Indian friendship. (Enduring applause)

We heartily congratulate the Soviet specialists and workers who, together with Indian specialists and workers, achieved such outstanding results and made a valuable contribution to the brotherly friendship between the peoples of India and the Soviet Union. (Enduring applause)

We believe that this production achievement brilliantly proves the correctness of the Leninist policy of peace, it is an example of the selfless economic cooperation of the Soviet Union with the peoples of various countries who are struggling to strengthen their freedom and independence. (Stormy applause)

The implementation of the Seven-Year Plan will play a huge role in maintaining world peace. The Soviet Union hopes to engage in peaceful competition with capitalist countries, allowing the peoples of all countries to choose the social system that best suits their interests.

In all countries, the proceedings of the 21st Congress of the CPSU are being discussed with great interest. It should be said that many newspapers in capitalist countries generally report objectively on the work of the congress. This is a good phenomenon because objective reporting of events in the newspapers will not make the situation more tense but will help to ease the tension and create conditions for the speedy resolution of urgent international problems in the interests of peace.

We are pleased to note that in most countries, people correctly understand our plans for peace. We have declared that we will continue to persistently pursue Lenin's peace policy aimed at maintaining and strengthening the peace and security of all peoples.

However, there are still many people in the West who distort our peace policy and oppose the principles of peaceful coexistence.

In this regard, let me talk about some issues of the current international situation and our unshakable belief in the need to strictly adhere to the principles of peaceful coexistence.

The issue of peace, the issue of peaceful coexistence—this is the most important issue, because the people of any country, regardless of their social system, want to live a good life, work in peace, and create better living conditions.

We adhere to the view that, regardless of the social system of the country, the peoples of all countries should live in peace, and disputes arising between countries should be resolved through peaceful means, not through war.

Now, great changes have taken place in the world. Some countries belong to the world socialist system, some countries belong to the world imperialist system, but there are also countries that are not socialist but cannot be included in the imperialist system. These countries, which have gained national independence through a struggle for liberation, want to bypass the capitalist stage of development and move forward on their own path to build a new life on a different basis after the end of colonial oppression.

Many activists of these countries say that they want to build socialism. Indeed, they pronounce the word "communism" with difficulty and do not always clearly understand what socialism means in their concept. However, there is no doubt that these people have good intentions towards socialist countries and do not consider these countries to be their enemies, do not consider socialist countries to be opposed to their aspirations to build a new life without imperialists and colonial oppression. Therefore, socialist countries have established good friendly relations with these countries and are developing normal economic ties. Together, we are fighting for the peace and security of all peoples, for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and against the colonialist policies of imperialists.

Thus, if we add the countries that belong to the world socialist system and the countries that are fighting heroically against imperialism and colonialism, striving for their freedom and national independence, then the advantage is now on the side of the peace-loving countries, not the imperialist countries. Whether in terms of territory, population, or natural wealth, the peace-loving countries exceed the imperialist countries.

One of the extremely important conclusions drawn from the analysis of the current distribution of forces in the world is that the majority of former colonies and semi-colonies, which were once the reserve forces and rear of imperialism, have changed their status. Through the long struggle of the people, these countries have become active forces for peace. They oppose imperialism and colonialism, strive for freedom and national independence, and advocate peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems.

In addition, it should be noted that the working people of capitalist countries—the working class, laboring peasants, and a large part of the intelligentsia—are doing their utmost to maintain peace and improve their own lives. They support the peace policy of socialist countries. In capitalist countries, in addition to the communist parties, there are also socialist and labor parties, and a part of the workers and peasants follow them. Although the political views and ideological views of these parties differ from those of Marxist-Leninist parties, the majority of their members are advocates of peace. On these issues, our efforts can be combined. Therefore, in the broad masses of working people in capitalist countries who are directly concerned with maintaining and strengthening peace, imperialists cannot find support.

The Soviet Union has persistently pursued and will continue to pursue a policy of peaceful diplomacy. The implementation of the Seven-Year Plan will play a huge role in solving the fundamental problem of the contemporary world—the maintenance of world peace.

We hope to engage in peaceful competition with capitalist countries, to compete in the development of productive forces, the discovery of the economic potential of the state, and the improvement of the material and cultural well-being of the people. We hope that each system will demonstrate its economic and spiritual strength in the competition. If we use the commercial terms that representatives of the capitalist world can more easily understand, then let us put our "goods" on display: the socialist world puts its goods on display, and the capitalist world also puts its goods on display. Let each system show how long the working day is, how much material and spiritual wealth the working people receive, how their housing is, how they receive education, how they participate in state affairs and political life, who is the owner of all material and cultural wealth—the workers or those who do not work but own capital.

We believe that the social system that can provide people with more material goods and unlimited possibilities for spiritual development is a progressive system, and the future belongs to this system.

Who will be the judge, who will decide which social system is better and more progressive? Of course, we do not agree to let the thinkers of the capitalist world be the judges, nor can we expect bourgeois thinkers to agree to let us be the judges. It should be considered that both sides will insist on their own positions. Then who will be the judge? The judge will be the people, they will decide which system is better. We believe that the people will make the right choice, and this will be done without starting wars, without using hydrogen bombs and atomic bombs.

In the capitalist world, competition has developed widely. When two competitors compete for a customer, the customer will ultimately go to the seller who offers better quality at a lower price, but the other competitor will not die, will not be physically destroyed.

We tell the capitalist countries: do it just like this, in a way that you can easily understand. You do not want to call the relationship between countries with two systems a peaceful competition. You prefer the word competition. Well, we agree. However, whether we choose the term competition or competition, in any case, we advocate solving problems without the roar of cannons, without using hydrogen weapons and atomic weapons, without using chemical weapons, bacteriological weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, without war, without destroying the wealth accumulated by mankind.

We want to give the peoples of all countries the opportunity to choose the social system that best suits their interests. Bourgeois activists often boast about the capitalist system. However, they do not want to take the path of peaceful economic competition with socialist countries and do not want to let the peoples of all countries choose the social system. This shows that they do not trust their own people, are afraid of the people, and cannot rely on their own people.

Some businessmen in the United States have said in their conversations that they hope we will not use the word "struggle" in our speeches, but rather use competition or competition. To avoid making the relationship tense, we agree to say "competition" or even "competition," and are willing to make some concessions and use the vocabulary that our opponents are used to hearing.

Some people in the United States hope that the "cold war" will flare up again. American strategists should no longer entertain the illusion that once a military conflict occurs, the United States can remain unscathed; they should know that the Soviet Union now has the means to deliver a devastating blow to any aggressor on Earth.

However, it is clear that the issue is not about vocabulary, not about terms. Just look at the recent speeches of American President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, Secretary of State Dulles, Senator Humphrey, and others. In their speeches, they call for increased vigilance and raise various doubts, making one feel that the old warlike terms are being brought out again, and the statements made by Mr. Dulles at a press conference on January 27. Dulles, without any basis, insisted that the Soviet Union intends to continue the "cold war," insisted that the Soviet Union's proposal to develop normal trade with the United States is actually aimed at creating more favorable conditions for itself and international communism in the "cold war" against capitalist countries.

It can be seen that some people in the United States want to make the warmth in our relations with some countries disappear, the warmth that was generated in the recent period due to Mikoyan's good reception in the United States. They hope that the "cold war" will flare up again and that our two countries will maintain tense relations.

And what do the prominent military figures of the United States say? Obviously, due to the division of labor, they talk more loudly about bombers, hydrogen bombs, and atomic bombs, about the ability to destroy the most important targets of the Soviet Union in a few hours or days, and to deliver a fatal blow to the Soviet Union. In short, the most arrogant and warlike American generals talk about preparing for a hot war, about the destruction of people and material wealth.

At the same time, American military and political figures often say that the United States has more favorable conditions in the military sense because they have a complete network of military bases in the territories of European and Asian countries that can attack our country, while the Soviet Union, they say, has fewer intercontinental missiles. Therefore, it is said that war is less threatening to the United States. For example, recently, the U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy said that the United States will attack from the territories of its allied countries near the Soviet border, while the Soviet Union can only launch missiles from its own territory.

It should be imagined that the British, French, Germans, Turks, Greeks, Italians, and peoples of other countries with American military bases have already noticed what this prospect portends for them.

If the strategic plan is based on an erroneous foundation, it will lead to miscalculations and have serious consequences for the cause of peace. If a country thinks that for a certain period of time the enemy does not have a weapon that can attack its territory, it will not be able to resist the temptation to use this favorable opportunity to start a war. If some people in the United States think that their territory is now invulnerable, they will think that the time to start a war has come. In this war, the British, French, Italians, Germans, Turks, and other allies of the United States will pay with blood and lives, and their territories will be reduced to ruins by medium-range and short-range missiles once the war starts. And what about the United States itself? According to these shortsighted military "strategists," it can prevent its own country from being destroyed.

The American activists, for their narrow interests, are ready to sacrifice their allies, disregarding the fate of humanity—this is a business attitude, a policy of blood merchants, who, for the sake of profit, not only plan to sell friends but are also ready to sell their own fathers.

It goes without saying that such a policy is alien to our people, to our Soviet state, to the working class, to those who stand on the positions of Marxism-Leninism. We persistently struggle to prevent the danger of war, to ban atomic and hydrogen weapons and to stop testing these weapons, to reach mutually acceptable agreements with the United States, Britain, France, and other Western countries on all extremely important issues. We are fighting for world peace because we value all people, regardless of their nationality, skin color, or beliefs. We believe that building the happiness of some people, some nations, on the misfortune and suffering of others is a crime. We believe that hoping for the great misfortune of some distant or neighboring countries and building the happiness of others on this without any reason is unacceptable.

If the politicians and military figures of the United States proceed from the wishes of all mankind, not from selfish calculations, then this will be beneficial not only to the American people but also to the peoples of all countries.

I think it is time for American strategists to stop basing their calculations on the illusion that once a military conflict occurs, the United States can remain unscathed. This has long been unrealistic and is only a delusion of American generals. You should know that the Soviet Union now actually has the means to deliver a devastating blow to any aggressor on Earth. We are not joking when we say that we have organized the mass production of intercontinental ballistic missiles. We are saying this not to frighten anyone, but to make the true situation clear.

Our Seven-Year Plan most convincingly proves the peaceful intentions of the Soviet Union. We need peace, and we persistently and unyieldingly struggle for peace. The peoples of all countries want peace. Therefore, the peace policy of the Soviet Union is so deeply respected and supported by the whole world.

Comrades! In easing international tensions, improving relations between the United States and the Soviet Union has particular significance. Not long ago, the Soviet government and the U.S. government exchanged rather sharp letters. This was because at that time, very sharp issues were being discussed in the international situation. The actions of some people in the United States caused concern among peace-loving peoples, and we could not fail to express our attitude towards such actions.

Now, these events have become a thing of the past. We should look to the future. The Soviet government is doing everything possible to ease international tensions and improve relations with all countries. We believe that if the U.S. President and other leaders truly want peace, as they said during their talks with Mikoyan, they will recognize the necessity of peaceful coexistence of all countries and will establish relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries on this basis.

To improve mutual understanding and establish friendly relations between countries, to expand trade and cultural ties, and to increase direct contacts between state and social activists can play a major role.

Everyone remembers the meeting of the leaders of the four powers in Geneva in the summer of 1955, which caused such a wide social response throughout the world. Peace-loving people saw this meeting as an important step towards easing international tensions.

Title: Report to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
Author:

Page: 1

My meeting and conversation with Mr. Eisenhower in Geneva left a good impression on me. I believe that although Mr. Eisenhower is a general, he is not the type of military man who relies solely on cannons and seeks to solve all problems by force. He has repeatedly stated that he is committed to preventing war. We value this point and hope that his words will be reflected in concrete actions.

Comrade Mikoyan's visit to the United States gives us reason to hope that relations between our two countries will further "thaw." We hope to develop contacts and exchanges. Incidentally, Comrade Mikoyan used his vacation to visit the United States. However, his view is that it would be better for him to vacation in the Soviet Union. (The hall is lively, applause)

His visit, to some extent, has raised the temperature of our relations from below zero to zero and above zero; the temperature is beginning to rise, and its direction is to reach a level suitable for normal collective life. Obviously, some politicians do not like this and are trying to downplay the positive impact of Comrade Mikoyan's visit on American public opinion.

Instead of continuing to expand these contacts, the United States is moving in the opposite direction. In a press conference on January 28, President Eisenhower bluntly replied to a reporter's question about whether I could visit the United States like Comrade Mikoyan, saying that this is impossible. He said:

"Mr. Khrushchev cannot visit the United States in an unofficial capacity like Mr. Mikoyan."

It is clear that one standard is applied to Mikoyan and another to me.

This is indeed a very surprising conclusion. It is somewhat discriminatory. One person can enjoy the rights that everyone else enjoys, but another person is deprived of these rights.

Please understand my meaning correctly. I have no intention of applying for a visa for such a visit. We have a lot of work here. Moreover, I have received many invitations and it is difficult to find time to visit one by one. Therefore, the issue is not whether I want to visit the United States or not, but rather another issue, that of human rights. It is puzzling why the President thinks I have committed some error and does not allow me to enjoy the same rights as others who are permitted to visit the United States.

As for us Soviets, we have a different attitude towards such issues. Whenever foreign politicians and travelers come to visit us, we are very happy.

In recent years, some American delegations, congressmen, and travelers have visited the Soviet Union, and some Soviets have visited the United States, which is a good thing and worthy of welcome. Our people have warmly received the Americans, and the American people have shown very friendly attitudes towards ours. This was particularly evident during Comrade Mikoyan's visit to the United States. If President Eisenhower decides to visit our country, he will be genuinely welcomed by the Soviet government and people. He can bring whoever he likes, and they will all be welcome guests. Let the President look at the map of the Soviet Union and choose the regions he wants to visit in our country. Our country is vast and there are many interesting places, places to see, and things to see. Undoubtedly, such a visit will be beneficial to both our countries and will be supported by the American and Soviet peoples. We make such invitations and do not ask for a return visit. (The hall is lively, applause)

Our starting point is that meetings, talks, and mutual visits between national leaders and social activists will help improve relations between countries, create a warm atmosphere for people's minds and bodies, and make it possible for people to live without fear of the future, to prevent war, and to ensure peaceful coexistence.

We should untie the "knots" in international relations, first of all, by concluding a peace treaty with Germany and solving the Berlin problem.

The peoples of various countries do not want a "cold war," and therefore there is no reason to maintain various "knots" in international relations. These knots should be untied. I am referring first of all to the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the solution of the Berlin problem. If these issues are resolved according to our proposals, it will not benefit any one side, but it will create conditions for the elimination of the "cold war," for the solution of the disarmament problem, and for the establishment of international relations in which war is not used as a means of resolving disputes.

Secretary of State Dulles said that the United States cannot make concessions in negotiations with the Soviet Union, and if they make concessions, it will not lead to the elimination of the "cold war," but only to the Soviet Union winning this "war." In this regard, we can tell Mr. Dulles: We do not ask anyone to make concessions to us. We hope for mutual understanding so that we can make concessions to reason. The Soviet Union does not want to win this "cold war" either for itself or for the United States, and generally speaking, the "cold war" is not winnable. At the same time, it is dangerous for everyone. If it is believed that the Soviet Union has gained some advantage in the "cold war" while the United States has lost this advantage, then in this case the "cold war" will not end, because the United States will continue to pursue its policy in order to regain the lost advantage.

If one wants to achieve victory in the "cold war," then the cold war will not end, and even worse, it will turn into military conflict. The governments of various countries should show their willingness to stop the "cold war," and first of all, they should understand that we live on one planet, and under the current level of technological development, the size of this planet is very limited, so we must act carefully and do everything possible to ensure peaceful coexistence.

We only hope for one thing, that is, to end the "cold war" as soon as possible. Mr. Dulles, if you want to do this, then for the sake of ending the cold war, we are even willing to acknowledge your "victory" in this war that the peoples of all countries do not need. Gentlemen, consider yourselves the "victors" in this "war," but end the "cold war" quickly.

All obstacles that hinder the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems must be removed from the road. When a narrow, tight boot rubs a soldier's foot and hinders him from marching in step, the boot must be resoled, and if that doesn't work, the boot must be changed.

The same must be done in policy. All policies that worsen the international situation and hinder peaceful coexistence must be abolished. The policy of rearming West Germany is currently such an obstacle. The Soviet Union's proposal for a peace treaty with Germany has given Mr. Dulles an excuse to say that the Soviet Union is seeking victory in the "cold war." But when the treaty is signed, who will win and who will lose? The winners will be all those who are eager to ensure peace, and the losers will be those who do not want peace. Of course, the treaty is not a trick in the "cold war," but a common cause of the peoples of all countries. If the United States takes the lead in preparing the treaty draft instead of looking for excuses to avoid negotiations, then we will not blame or suspect them of having selfish motives.

The Soviet Union has shown initiative and put forward its draft peace treaty with Germany. If the United States has any objections or special hopes that should be reflected in the treaty, then no one will prevent them from expressing their views. The proposal to convene a conference is precisely for this purpose.

Therefore, we appeal to the leaders of the United States and other Western countries to correctly assess the Soviet Union's proposals aimed at strengthening peace.

For example, the issue of West Berlin. Mr. Dulles said: West Berlin cannot be handed over. I ask, handed over to whom? Did the Soviet proposal mention anything about handing over West Berlin?

If West Berlin were not a source of unrest and conflict in the heart of the German Democratic Republic, there would be no Berlin problem. But today, the situation in West Berlin can lead to various unpleasant incidents. This situation can be compared to a fuse in a powder keg or a delayed-action bomb, which can cause an explosion at any time. Why should we maintain such a situation? Wouldn't it be better to extinguish the fuse and remove the delayed-action bomb? It is difficult to find another solution that would be in the interests of both Germanies and would not cause complaints and losses to other concerned countries. Making West Berlin a free city could be such a solution now. This solution does not touch the existing basis of life in this city and can, with the appropriate guarantees, eliminate the possibility of external interference in its internal affairs.

Therefore, we are ready to participate with the United States, Britain, and France in formulating a principle that would ensure the normal development of West Berlin, ensure the city's relations with all the countries it wishes to establish relations with, and ensure the free entry and exit of these countries into the free city. We also agree to the participation of the United Nations in ensuring the status of the free city and are willing to discuss how it can participate in this matter in an appropriate manner. Of course, the formulation and resolution of these proposals should be done with the participation of the German Democratic Republic. Because Berlin is on its territory. We believe that turning West Berlin into a demilitarized free city will create conditions for solving other disputes and will help ensure the security of Europe, that is, the security of the whole world.

I may be repeating myself, but before we can make the concerned parties understand the full seriousness of the situation, consider what consequences the continuation of this situation will bring, and correctly understand this issue, we have to repeat this issue again and again. The Soviet Union will not relax its efforts to achieve the stated goals.

Comrades, allow me to appeal from the rostrum of our congress to the German people to support the proposals aimed at strengthening European peace and the security of the peoples of all countries.

In the past half-century, German imperialism has twice thrown the German people into the bloody abyss of world war. Many peoples of other countries were also drawn into these two wars. But the greatest sacrifices were made by the peoples of our country and the German people. How much blood and tears were shed, and how much destruction did our two countries suffer!

Hitler, with the help of the nationalist and chauvinist propaganda machine, plotted and launched the Second World War. He wanted to make the Germans believe that Germany was supreme, that the Germans were a superior race, and that Germany must expand its "living space" no more and no less than to the Urals. Everyone knows the outcome of Hitler's military aggression. The Germans brought great disasters to the peoples of Europe, but they suffered a complete defeat. Unfortunately, some aggressive politicians in West Germany want to follow Hitler's old path. Obviously, they have not learned any lessons from history and are trying to launch a third aggressive war by the German people.

The leaders of imperialism, out of hatred for the peoples of socialist countries who are successfully developing their economies and cultures and improving their well-being, have gone crazy. They even want to rely on the Germans to stop the march of history and turn the wheels of history backward. But in the era of atomic and hydrogen weapons, in the era of rocket technology, such an attempt is foolish and unwise, as it will not only bring destruction to millions of people but will also bring destruction to entire nations and entire countries. At the same time, West Germany's participation in an aggressive war against socialist countries will inevitably put it in such a situation that Germany will be the first to suffer the blows of these weapons, and most of the accumulated hydrogen weapons will fall on German soil.

We hope that the workers, peasants, intellectuals, and leaders of various parties and national activists of West Germany will understand the great responsibility they bear in the following matter: in which direction will West Germany develop—towards continuing to be a source of international military conflict, or towards eliminating these sources to pave the way for friendly relations between countries with different social systems?

The industrious and talented German people have contributed many great thinkers and outstanding scientists, poets, and musicians to the world. The German people have built a powerful industry and ensured a high standard of living, and they have done this not under the leadership of Hitler and Goebbels, who drove the German people to seize the territories of other countries. Does this not show that the German people should seek their future in peaceful labor, not on the battlefield? If the current tension is eliminated, and if the government of the Federal Republic of Germany promotes economic relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries, as well as with all countries in the world, then the German people will have more room to develop their strength. They will be able to improve their economy, improve their material well-being, and increase the material and spiritual wealth of their nation.

Unfortunately, Chancellor Adenauer of West Germany looks in the opposite direction, hoping only for the continuation of the "cold war" and the policy of "strength." Chancellor, you are sitting on the bank of a river with a fishing rod, waiting for a fish to bite, and you want to catch a fish that does not exist in this river. Isn't it time for you to give up unrealistic illusions?

Chancellor Adenauer said that if the Soviet Union does not pay for cooperation, the Federal Republic of Germany will not cooperate with the Soviet Union. Chancellor, do not treat politics like a grocer in a food store. There is no reason for us to pay, we do not owe you anything. We hope you understand that for the Federal Republic of Germany, there is no other sensible policy than peaceful cooperation with neighboring countries in the East and West. Neither you nor your allies can eliminate the socialist system in East Germany.

The Germans in East Germany do not want the old days to return. We understand their interests and have supported and will continue to support the German Democratic Republic. It is not difficult to imagine that the Germans in East Germany also firmly believe that the elimination of the existing system in West Germany is correct. But the formulation of the problem in this way is not realistic, because social changes are made by the people themselves, and there can be no bargaining here.

One must act on the basis of a realistic policy that corresponds to the current historical moment. If one does not understand this and acts in the old way, feeling no pulse of life, this may bring disaster to millions of people. We are willing to listen to your proposals. If these proposals are reasonable, we agree to sit at a table to discuss your and our proposals in order to find a basis for concluding an agreement that both sides can accept, and to sign the agreement.

But if the conditions you propose are to eliminate the German Democratic Republic, to annex it, and to take away the social achievements of the working people of the German Democratic Republic, then we will not even discuss such conditions. If we do this, it will be an overstepping of our authority, because this will be interference in the internal affairs of others. Each nation's people should decide for themselves what social system is suitable for them. When they make this decision is their business. If the peoples of the two Germanies agree to hold the so-called free elections that the Western countries talk so much about, we will not oppose holding such elections, but there must be no interference from a third party. It can be predicted that after a certain period, the Germans will want to hold free elections to eliminate the capitalist system in West Germany. It seems that Chancellor Adenauer cannot allow such a thought, but such a practice is quite possible. However, this is the business of the Germans themselves.

Here, I will briefly discuss the issue of free elections. The ruling class of the Western countries looks at this issue from their own point of view. Everyone knows that at the Geneva Conference in 1954, an agreement was reached on the issue of holding free elections in South and North Vietnam to achieve the peaceful reunification of the country. But the puppet government of South Vietnam, with the support of the United States, sabotaged these elections.

The Soviet Union is ready to reach an agreement at any time to stop the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, but the West is ready to completely sabotage the solution to this issue.

Comrades! Now I want to talk about an issue that we consider to be one of the important international issues. I am referring to the issue of stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

Last summer, a conference of experts was held in Geneva on the following issue: how to detect nuclear explosions, and if an agreement to stop nuclear testing is signed, how to ensure that the signatory parties strictly adhere to this agreement. The results of the conference fully confirmed the Soviet view: any nuclear explosion can be detected, no matter where it is conducted. The most authoritative experts, including those from the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain, drafted specific proposals for the supervision system to detect atomic and hydrogen bomb explosions.

We are pleased with the effective work of the experts. The Soviet government fully supports the conclusions and proposals unanimously adopted at the Geneva Conference. At that time, we had the impression that we could finally sign a treaty with the United States and Britain to permanently stop the testing of nuclear weapons without further delay.

Unfortunately, it turned out not to be the case. The representatives of the three governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain opened a meeting in Geneva for more than three months to draft and sign a treaty to stop testing. But there was no progress. Judging from the way the talks were conducted, it is obvious that our opponents are determined not to reach an agreement.

On what basis do I draw such a conclusion? There are many reasons.

First of all, the United States, with the full support of Britain, tried to nullify the beneficial results achieved at the Geneva experts' conference last summer. The U.S. government initially agreed with the conclusions of the experts, but then suddenly issued a statement saying that there were new materials, saying that detecting underground nuclear explosions was more difficult than previously thought. In fact, the opposite is true: the more time passes, the easier it is to detect various nuclear explosions, because the technology for detecting nuclear explosions is constantly improving.

We believe that the reason for reconsidering the experts' proposals is to obstruct the signing of the agreement to stop the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

It is impossible not to draw such a conclusion: the requirements put forward by the United States and Britain in the discussion of the issue of establishing a supervision system to implement the agreement to stop testing are also aimed at the same purpose.

Judge for yourselves what they want! They want to make all the so-called explosion detection supervision posts fully staffed with foreigners, allowing foreign investigators to move freely throughout the territory of the treaty signatory countries. They also want to create a situation where the supervision committee to which these supervision posts and investigators belong can, with a hard and fast majority of Western country representatives, force through decisions that infringe on the security interests of the Soviet Union.

But tell me, what is the difference between this and the proposal made by President Eisenhower for Americans to be able to fly and photograph freely over the entire territory of the Soviet Union? Again, what is the difference between this and the so-called Baruch Plan? This plan actually stipulates that the American monopoly organization will supervise the production of atomic fission materials in various countries, including the Soviet Union. Everyone knows that these proposals have been rejected. Similarly, we now reject these proposals, because we cannot allow others to infringe on the sovereignty and security of the Soviet state. We will not agree to this. To satisfy the unreasonable demands of the American and British representatives in Geneva now is to agree to the establishment of a real intelligence network by the Western countries on our territory.

Someone might say that the United States and Britain made their proposals on the condition that such a supervision system could also be established on their territory. This may be correct, but we do not need to supervise their territory, because we do not intend to wage war. We do not have military bases in any country around the United States, whether in Mexico, Canada, or other countries near the United States.

The Soviet Union has no military bases on the territory of other countries, because we believe that the establishment of such bases, especially in places ten thousand miles away from our territory, is either preparing for war or preparing for aggression. After the Western countries surrounded us with their military bases, they are now trying to establish their military surveillance bases on our territory and gain the right to conduct aerial surveillance of Soviet territory, so that they can use their military bases to attack our country at the right time. They also want us to help them realize these plots. Gentlemen, isn't this a bit too much? (The hall is lively, applause)

If the leaders of this country care about the interests of their country and the security of their people, if their minds are clear, can they accept such demands? This is a crime against the motherland.

We believe that the Western countries' demands for us are a malicious attempt to force us. If the Western countries say that they have no malicious intentions, I suggest that they give up their demands and stop the actions that cause us to doubt.

We advocate establishing appropriate supervision for the cessation of nuclear testing. The Soviet Union has put forward proposals for such supervision at the current Geneva Conference. However, we do not allow the Western countries to infringe on our sovereignty under the pretext of supervision. If the United States and Britain give up their unreasonable demands, the Soviet Union is ready to provide all the conditions for the effective operation of the supervision posts with foreign representatives and for the installation and use of instruments.

Everyone knows that even now, when there is no international supervision, the nuclear explosions conducted by the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain are not undetectable. For example, the explosions conducted by the United States are detected by monitoring instruments in the Soviet Union, and our explosions can also be detected by the United States. Now it is necessary to establish a wide network of supervision posts to detect explosions in countries where no supervision posts are set up. However, the Western countries also demand some sudden inspections and want their investigators to have the right to move freely throughout the Soviet Union without restrictions.

Isn't it clear that the head of such a supervision system will become the head of military intelligence? He can say at any time that he suspects an explosion in a region of interest to him, and then send a special investigation team to investigate this region. Every person, even the least experienced politician and national leader, will understand what the consequences of this will be. This will create bad consequences: it will create a deterioration in relations between the signatory countries of the treaty.

We do not ask for any special position for ourselves. Our only demand is for truly equal conditions with the Western countries. While the United States and Britain, that is, the military bloc of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, want to obtain unilateral benefits at the expense of the interests of the Soviet Union.

The breadth of mutual supervision is closely related to the degree of trust in relations between countries. The greater the trust, the easier it is to reach an agreement on broad supervision. Of course, in the case of absolute trust, there is no need for supervision at all.

In the face of the continued existence of many military bases of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization around the Soviet Union, and the restriction by the United States, Britain, and the aggressive military bloc they have concocted—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact—of even ordinary trade relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, can one allow the forced demand for unlimited supervision? Someone accuses us of using trade to achieve political purposes, but in fact, it is the United States that has almost stopped trade with socialist countries for political purposes. Their economic interests precisely require the development of trade, and the business community of the Western countries advocates the development of trade.

Comrades, the situation in the negotiations on the cessation of testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons is like this. In Geneva, our negotiating partners put forward proposals that they knew would not be accepted, obviously to obstruct the solution to this issue, just as they did in the issue of preventing surprise attacks, which they have actually brought to a stalemate. It seems that in the conference on the cessation of testing, they also intend to drag it out until the public opinion is prepared to sabotage the negotiations, and then completely sabotage the solution to this extremely important issue.

I hope my prediction will not come true. As for the Soviet Union, I want to reiterate our desire to reach an agreement on the cessation of nuclear testing as soon as possible. We are ready to sign a treaty on this issue at any time, and this treaty should be based on reasonable conditions and ensure the necessary supervision of explosions.

The international life of the parties is like this, and I think it is appropriate to discuss these issues in my concluding speech. (Applause)

Comrades! The 20th Congress will adopt a grand program for the construction of communism. Our party and the heroic people of the Soviet Union will accomplish great deeds. The completion of the seven-year plan will bring our country to such a height that no one will have any doubt about the great superiority of communism over the outdated capitalism. (Prolonged applause)

We all have the right to be proud of the generation that overcame unimaginable difficulties under the leadership of the immortal Lenin and established our glorious Communist Party, the generation that accomplished the great October Socialist Revolution under the leadership of the Communist Party and opened a new era in human history. (Stormy applause) We are proud of the generation that laid the first foundations and built the great edifice of socialism. Our contemporaries will realize the ideal of mankind—to build a communist society, the most just society in the world. (Stormy applause)

Thousands of years will pass, but the glory of our heroic age—the age of building socialism and communism—will never fade! (Stormy, prolonged applause)

Comrades! Forward to the victory of communism on the Leninist path! (Stormy, prolonged applause, turning into enthusiastic cheers. Everyone stands up)

    二月五日在苏共第二十一次代表大会上
    赫鲁晓夫同志的总结发言
    同志们！
    我们的代表大会就要结束了。在代表大会上以及在准备代表大会的过程中，讨论1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济控制数字的情况证明，我们全党、全体苏联人民都一致拥护七年计划，并且充满决心来实现这个计划。
    在代表大会上发言的有八十六位同志。其中有各加盟共和国、许多自治共和国、边疆区和州的党组织的代表，我们工农业方面的出色的先进工作者，科学、技术和文化工作者。
    在会上发言的所有同志都表示他们完全同意提交代表大会讨论的控制数字。他们认为七年计划反映了党在我国建设共产主义的现阶段的列宁主义总路线。
    大会标志着苏联进入全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期，大会的工作渗透了实事求是的、踏实具体的精神。
    我们代表大会的工作生动地表现了我们党磐石般的团结一致以及各个党组织和全体共产党员的高度积极性。人们有充分根据把苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会称为共产主义建设者的代表大会，它标志着我国进入一个新的历史发展时期——全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期。代表大会显示了马克思列宁主义思想的伟大创造力量，显示了马克思列宁主义思想同正在建设共产主义光辉大厦的人民群众的实践有着活生生的、不可分割的联系。
    在代表大会上的发言中提出了许多具体的、极有价值的建议，实现这些建议就可以更充分地利用工农业中取之不尽的潜力，来胜利完成和超额完成计划。
    当我听到代表大会代表们的发言时，我想起了弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁在讨论第一个国民经济计划——俄国电气化计划的全俄苏维埃代表大会上的讲话。列宁说：“我认为，我们是在非常重大的转变关头在这里开会的，这个转变无论如何都证明了苏维埃政权已经开始取得巨大的成就。今后出现在全俄代表大会讲台上的，不仅有政治家和行政人员，而且有工程师和农艺师。这是最幸福的时代的开始……为了真正转向经济建设事业，必须由全俄苏维埃代表大会首先树立这种风气，并且自上而下地在所有的苏维埃和团体中，在一切报纸上，在一切宣传鼓动部门内，在一切机关内都来树立这种风气。……不要把代表大会和会议变成空谈的机关，而要变成检查经济成就的机关，变成我们能够真正学习经济建设的机关”。（列宁全集俄文本第三十一卷第481—482页，中文本第466页）。
    党正在按照伟大的列宁所建议的那样做。我们代表大会的工作渗透了实事求是的、踏实具体的精神，渗透了用创造性的态度来解决已经成熟了的共产主义建设问题的精神。你们看，这对代表大会的工作起了多么良好的影响，对提高千百万工人，集体农民和知识分子群众的积极性、提高他们的整个实际工作有着多么良好的影响。
    我们积累了丰富的经济建设经验，我们党组织急剧地转向解决国内经济领导的根本问题，并且取得了不小的成就。在解决七年计划的宏伟任务时，列宁关于我们一切工作要实事求是、具体和目标明确的指示应该作为从下到上各级党组织的行动指南，作为苏维埃社会每一个劳动者集体的行动指南。
    我们非常注意地倾听了党、苏维埃、经济、工会和共青团各方面领导工作人员，科学家、工程师和农艺师的发言，以及工农业生产的先进工作者的精采发言。他们全都谈到了我国面临的具体而重要的任务。
    在这里发言的有顿涅茨煤区有名的矿工尼古拉·雅科夫列维奇·马马伊、莫斯科轮胎厂的钳工亚力山德拉，米哈伊洛夫娜·雷巴科娃、列宁格勒船坞厂装配工弗拉基米尔·伊万诺维奇·戈尔布诺夫、“红色索尔莫沃”造船厂的炼钢工尼古拉·伊万诺维奇·阿尼申科夫、明斯克汽车厂的工人季米特里·伊万诺维奇·巴拉什金和其他许多人。这是一些非常有意义、内容非常丰富的发言！这些发言渗透着丰富的专业知识和主人翁式的关怀，这不仅是对自己工厂和矿井的生产发展的关怀，而且是对全国发展的关怀。
    还可以举出一些优秀的农业先进生产者的发言，如叶夫根尼·阿列克谢耶夫娜·多利纽克、亚历山大·瓦西里耶维奇·吉塔洛夫、佩拉格娅·尼康德罗夫娜·科瓦列娃、谢尔盖·库兹米奇·鲍科、叶夫根尼·伊凡诺夫娜·安德列耶娃、捷连季·谢苗诺维奇·马尔采夫等同志的发言。他们谈到自己的集体农庄的工作时令人信服地表明，只要很好地经营就能够获得怎样的成就；我们集体农庄和国营农场拥有多么大的潜力。
    从这个崇高的讲台上，我们也听到我们杰出的科学家的发言，如伊戈尔·瓦西里耶维奇·库尔查托夫院士、米哈伊尔·阿列克谢耶维奇·拉夫连捷夫院士、苏联科学院院长亚历山大·尼古拉耶维奇·涅斯米扬诺夫、哈萨克共和国科学院院长坎尼希·伊曼塔耶维奇·萨特帕耶夫、著名诗人亚历山大·特里弗诺维奇·特瓦尔多夫斯基和我们光荣的创作知识界的其他代表的发言。
    非常精采的是，党和苏维埃领导人员在代表大会上发言讨论七年计划问题时，讲话里都充满了工农业生产的渊博知识，并且依靠群众的丰富经验，具体地接触到了解决迫切任务的办法。
    工农业先进生产者、知识界代表、党和苏维埃工作人员，所有在代表大会上发言的同志都确信地说，七年任务不仅能够完成，而且能够超额完成。
    从我们党代表大会讲台上听到了来自生活的深处和人民群众当中的人的有力而坚信的声音，听到洞悉并反映千百万人的心情、思想和感情的人的声音，这是使人高兴和愉快的。这些发言说明实际上已经着手执行七年计划宏伟任务的苏联人民的伟大的热潮。这一切还说明，我们的干部已经成长到什么程度，苏联人的思考范围多么广阔，他们不仅对自己的具体业务，而且对国家生活了解得多么深入。
    我已经说过，在讨论关于七年苏联发展国民经济控制数字的报告的过程中，提出了许多非常宝贵的建议。党中央委员会和苏联部长会议将考虑在代表大会发言中所谈到的希望和建议。必须责成国家计划委员会、各共和国和其他地方机构仔细研究劳动人民在讨论控制数字过程中所提出的许许多多的具体建议，并且采取措施来实施这些建议。
    代表大会一些代表在发言中谴责了酗酒现象，并且提出加强同这种坏事进行斗争和防止私自酿酒的问题。私自酿酒的人不仅糟蹋糖、粮食和其他食品，不仅进行投机，而且去灌醉意志不坚强的人，毒害他们的身体，因为私酒中含有很多杂醇油。
    我认为，关于大力防止酗酒和私自酿酒的建议是正确的，代表大会支持提出这些建议的同志们。
    如果各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会和部长会议更多地注意这个问题，拟出具体措施来制止滥用酒精饮料，对付酿酒的人，对付那些严重损害人们健康和危害社会的“化学家”，那就好了。
    我想，各共和国应当就这个问题起草法律草案，提交给劳动人民讨论，讨论了这些草案之后应当就通过法律，规定严厉的措施来对付那些滥用酒精饮料和破坏社会秩序的人，特别是对付那些私自酿酒的人。我们深信，每个共和国的劳动人民都一定会拥护大力防止酗酒和私自酿酒的措施。
    同志们！在这些日子里，我们全国在密切地注意着代表大会的工作。各企业、建筑工地、集体农庄、国营农场和科学机关，到处都举行了群众大会和会议，广泛地讨论了代表大会的文件。第二十一次代表大会收到了数以千计的信件和电报，它们不仅表示祝贺，而且还报告了为迎接第二十一次代表大会而做的具体工作。“真理报”刊登了给党的第二十一次代表大会寄来贺信、贺电并且提出了提前完成七年计划任务的崇高保证的各个劳动者集体的名单。
    我谨代表我们的代表大会向那些给党的第二十一次代表大会寄来贺信、贺电的一切单位和同志表示衷心的感谢，并且祝他们在造福祖国的劳动中取得新的成就。
    我们相信，为争取完成和超额完成七年计划而在全国展开的全民社会主义竞赛现在正取得越来越广泛的规模，并且一定会以新的、出色的劳动胜利而结束。
    看，太阳又露了出来，阳光灿烂。它自始至终伴随着我们代表大会的工作。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    兄弟党的祝贺显示了国际共产主义运动的团结，苏联将不吝惜力量完成自己的国际主义任务。
    同志们！有七十二个外国共产党和工人党的代表团出席了我们的代表大会。有些不能派代表亲自出席我们代表大会的兄弟党给代表大会寄来了友好的贺信、贺电。
    马克思列宁主义兄弟党在贺词和贺信、贺电中代表他们本国的共产党员、工人阶级和千百万劳动人民向我们党和全体苏联人民表达了真挚的友好和团结一致的感情。这些祝贺中充满了热诚的词句，表达了社会主义国家的人民和广大的劳动群众，和平、民主和世界进步的维护者对我们党和我们国家的巨大信任和真挚感情。
    中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国、阿尔巴尼亚和蒙古人民共和国兄弟党的代表团谈到他们本国人民在共产党和工人党的领导下在社会主义建设事业中所取得的辉煌成就，这是令人高兴的消息。
    来自资本主义国家各兄弟党的同志在这里谈到了这些国家的共产党人为工人阶级的利益、为和平和各国人民的安全、为一切劳动人民的幸福所进行的艰苦而英勇的斗争。
    共产党树立了一种传统，就是在各党开代表大会时互派代表团。我们今后也将遵守这个传统，因为这个传统很好地表现了兄弟党的团结和互相支持的精神，表现了无产阶级国际主义的精神。
    兄弟党的祝贺，它们的代表同我们代表大会的代表、同莫斯科劳动人民的会见，生动地显示了国际共产主义运动以马克思列宁主义原则为基础的统一、力量和团结。
    我谨代表我们党代表大会和苏联人民向各兄弟党表示最真诚的感谢，感谢他们向苏联共产党和苏联各族人民表示的祝贺和对它们的成功的友好祝愿。
    我们也热烈祝贺所有兄弟共产党和工人党在他们为和平和社会主义事业而进行的英勇斗争中取得成就。
    请允许我也向给我们党代表大会发来贺电、贺信的外国各社会团体、工会和劳动人民表示感谢。
    亲爱的各兄弟共产党和工人党的贵宾们！你们从地球的各个角落前来参加我们的代表大会。请向你们党的党员和你们国家的劳动人民转达苏共第二十一次代表大会的心意：苏联的共产党员和全体人民一定会非常珍视在给我们代表大会的祝贺中所表示的同志感情、友谊和团结。
    我们党和苏联人民认为自己的国际主义义务是不断加强同全世界劳动人民和民主力量的友谊与无产阶级团结，加强强大的社会主义阵营，不断为国际和平而奋斗。
    共产党和苏联人民认为胜利完成和超额完成新的七年计划是自己的极重要的国际主义任务。
    亲爱的同志们，可以毫不怀疑，所有共产党员和苏联劳动人民将不吝惜力量，来光荣地完成这个历史任务！
    同志们！党的第二十一次代表大会制定了和平创造的宏伟计划。代表大会的工作体现了党、全体苏联人民贯彻共产主义建设计划的信心，体现了要尽一切努力来维护和平，来保证不同社会制度的国家和平共处的愿望。我们代表大会的极重要的特点就在于此。甚至“冷战”的拥护者，如果他们客观地估计事情的话，那么他们也会看到，我们代表大会所要采取的计划，其目的是为了保证和平共处，巩固世界和平事业。
    代表同志们！我高兴地告诉你们，在印度建设比莱钢铁厂（这个工厂由印度政府在苏联帮助下兴建的）我们的苏联专家报告了巨大的生产成就。2月1日炼出了第一炉焦炭，2月3日炼出了第一炉生铁。（暴风雨般的掌声）这个规模宏大的钢铁厂正在按照苏联的设计、在我们的专家的领导下进行建设。
    应该指出，除了在苏联帮助下建设的这个工厂之外，在印度，还有两个工厂正在兴建，一个是用英国的力量，一个是用西德的力量。虽然比莱钢铁厂比英国和西德公司建设的两个工厂迟一年半开始兴建，但是，由于我们的同志同印度专家和工人亲密合作，克服了重重困难，能够在比英国人和德国人更短的时间内完成了这个强大的现代化钢铁厂的第一期工程，并炼出了第一炉焦炭和生铁。（掌声）
    让这个工厂生产的第一炉生铁作为苏联和印度两国人民日益加强的友谊的象征吧！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    让帝国主义者的所有阴谋诡计都在这个高炉的火焰中烧毁吧，他们力图阻碍苏印友谊的进一步发展，阻碍我们为争取和平、争取和平共处原则的胜利而作的共同斗争。（经久不息的掌声）
    让这个高炉的热量来温暖我们两国伟大的爱好和平的人民的友谊吧！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    让我们的友谊像这个由于苏联和印度两国人民和政府的共同努力而建立起来的工厂所冶炼的金属一样地牢固吧！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我们向印度人民和以尼赫鲁总理先生为首的印度政府祝贺他们获得了在国家工业化和加强经济独立方面具有重大意义的巨大生产成就。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们感到愉快的是，印度共和国总统普拉沙德先生参加了冶金工厂第一期工程投入生产的仪式，并表示了关于加强苏印友谊的良好愿望。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们衷心地祝贺苏联专家和工人们，他们同印度专家和工人们一起获得了这样出色的成就，对印度和苏联两国人民之间的兄弟友谊作出了宝贵的贡献。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们认为，这一生产成就光辉地证明了列宁主义的和平政策的正确性，它是苏联同正在为加强本国自由和独立而斗争的各国人民进行无私的经济合作的范例。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    七年计划的实现对维护世界和平将起巨大作用。苏联希望同资本主义国家进行和平竞赛，让各国人民自己选择最符合他们利益的社会制度。
    在所有国家里，都以极大的兴趣讨论着苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的进程。应该说，许多资本主义国家的报刊一般讲来客观地报道了代表大会的工作。这是好现象，因为在报纸上客观反映事件不会使空气更加紧张，而会有助于缓和紧张局势，会为根据和平的利益加速解决迫切的国际问题创造条件。
    我们满意地指出，大多数国家中人们对我们计划的和平意愿有正确的理解。我们宣布过，我们今后将继续坚持不懈地奉行旨在维护和加强各国人民和平与安全的列宁的和平外交政策。
    然而西方却还有不少人士歪曲我国的和平政策，反对和平共处的各项原则。
    在这方面请让我谈一谈当前国际局势的某些问题，谈谈我们对必须坚决遵守和平共处的各项原则的不可动摇的信念。
    和平问题，和平共处问题——这是最重要的问题，因为任何一个国家的人民，不管他们国家的社会制度如何，都希望过美好的生活，进行和平劳动，创造更美好的生活条件。
    我们坚持这样的观点：不问国家的社会制度如何，各国人民应当和平相处，各国之间所产生的争端应当通过和平途径、而不是通过战争途径来求得解决。
    现在世界上发生了巨大的变化。有的国家是属于世界社会主义体系的，有的国家是属于世界帝国主义体系的，然而也有这样一些国家，它们不是社会主义的，但是却也不能把它们列入帝国主义体系。这些经过解放斗争获得了民族独立的国家想要绕过资本主义发展阶段沿着自己的道路前进，以便在结束殖民主义压迫后，着手在另外一种基础上建设社会。
    这些国家的许多活动家都说，他们想建设社会主义。诚然，他们是很吃力地讲着“共产主义”这几个字，而且，并不总是清楚，社会主义在他们的概念中意味着什么。但是，毫无疑问，这些人士对社会主义国家是怀着好意的，并不把这些国家看作是自己的敌对者，不认为社会主义国家反对他们在没有帝国主义者、没有殖民主义压迫的情况下建设新生活的抱负。因此，社会主义国家同这些国家建立了良好的友谊关系，发展着正常的经济联系。我们一道在为各国人民的和平和安全，为禁止原子武器和氢武器，为反对帝国主义者的殖民主义政策而共同斗争。
    这样，如果把属于世界社会主义体系的国家和正在为反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取自己的自由和民族独立而进行英勇斗争的国家算在一起，那么，优势现在已经在这些爱好和平的国家方面，而不是在帝国主义国家方面了。无论在领土方面，在人口方面，还是在自然财富方面，爱好和平的国家都超过帝国主义国家。
    从分析现在世界上的力量配置所得出的极其重要的结论之一就是，不久以前还是帝国主义的后备力量和后方的大多数殖民地和半殖民地国家，已经改变了这种地位。经过人民的长期斗争，这些国家已成为积极的和平力量。它们反对帝国主义和殖民主义，争取自由和民族独立，主张社会制度不同的国家和平共处。
    此外，应该注意到，资本主义国家的劳动人民——工人阶级、劳动农民、很大一部分知识分子，都在竭尽全力维护和平和争取改善自己的生活，他们拥护社会主义国家的和平政策。在资本主义国家里，除了共产党以外，还有社会党和劳工党，有一部分工人和农民跟着它们走。虽然这些政党的政治观点和思想观点同马克思列宁主义政党的观点有分歧，但是这些党的大多数成员是主张和平的。在这些问题上，我们的努力是可以联合起来的。因此，在资本主义国家切身关心维护和巩固和平的广大劳动人民群众中，帝国主义者不可能得到支持。
    苏联坚持不懈地奉行了并将继续奉行和平外交政策。七年计划的实现将在解决当代的根本问题——维护世界和平——方面起巨大的作用。
    我们希望同资本主义国家进行和平竞赛，希望在发展生产力、发掘国家经济潜力、提高人民的物质和文化福利等方面进行竞赛。我们希望每一种制度将在竞赛过程中显示出自己的经济和精神力量。如果用那种资本主义世界的代表显然比较容易理解的商业术语来说，那么让我们把自己的“货色”摆出来：社会主义世界摆出自己的，资本主义世界也摆出自己的。让每一个制度表明，那里的工作日有多长，劳动人民获得多少物质财富和精神财富，他们的住宅怎样，他们受教育的机会怎样，他们怎样参加国家事务和国家政治生活，谁是一切物质财富和文化财富的主人——是劳动者呢，还是那些不劳动而拥有资本的人呢。
    我们认为，能给人民带来更多的物质资料、能为人民的精神发展提供无限可能性的社会制度，是进步的制度，未来是属于这种制度的。
    谁将是裁判员，谁来决定怎样的社会制度更好和更进步？当然，我们不同意让资本主义世界的思想家来做裁判员，也不能指望资产阶级的思想家会同意我们做裁判员。应当认为，双方都会坚持自己的立场。那么谁将做裁判员呢？裁判员将是人民，他们会决定哪种制度更好。我们相信，人民将会作出正确的抉择，而且是在各国间不挑起战争、不用氢弹和原子弹的情况下作出这样的抉择。
    在资本主义世界中，竞争得到了广泛的发展。当两个竞争者互相争夺一个主顾时，主顾终究将走向其中价廉物美的一个卖主，但是另一个竞争者不会死去，没有被夺去生命，没有在肉体上被消灭。
    我们告诉资本主义国家：就按照这个对你们容易理解的方式做吧。你们不想把两个制度国家之间的关系叫做和平竞赛。你们比较喜欢竞争这个词。好吧，我们同意。但是，无论我们选择怎样的术语——竞赛或者竞争，无论在哪个场合下，我们都主张在没有大炮的轰隆声的情况下，在不使用氢武器和原子武器的情况下，在不使用化学武器、细菌武器和其他的杀人武器的情况下，在没有战争的情况下，在不毁灭人类所积累的财富的情况下，解决问题。
    我们要给各国人民以可能来自己选择最符合他们利益的社会制度。资产阶级的活动家常常吹嘘资本主义制度。但是，他们却不想走同社会主义国家进行和平经济竞赛的道路，不想让各国人民自己选择社会制度。这说明，他们不相信本国人民，害怕人民，不能信赖自己的人民。
    美国商界的某些人士在谈话中表示，希望我们在自己的言论中不使用“斗争”这个词，而讲竞赛或者竞争。为了不使关系紧张，我们同意说“竞赛”，或者甚至说“竞争”，愿意这样作些让步，使用我们的反对者听得习惯的词汇。
    美国某些人士希望“冷战”复炽。美国战略家们不应该再幻想一旦发生军事冲突，美国可以安然无恙；要知道，苏联已拥有能给地球上任何一点的侵略者以毁灭性打击的手段。
    但是，显然问题不在词汇上，不在术语上。就拿美国总统艾森豪威尔、副总统尼克松、国务卿杜勒斯、参议员汉弗莱以及其他人最近的言论来说吧。在他们的言论中，叫嚣要提高警惕，并提出种种怀疑，使人感到又在搬出老一套的好战术语，又拿出如杜勒斯先生1月27日在记者招待会上的那些说法。杜勒斯毫无根据地硬说，苏联打算继续进行“冷战”，硬说苏联提出发展苏美正常贸易的建议，实际上是想给自己和国际共产主义在对资本主义国家进行的“冷战”中创造更加有利的条件。
    由此可见，美国某些人士想把我们两国关系中的某些热气化为乌有，这种热气是在最近一段期间由于米高扬在美国受到很好接待而产生的。他们希望“冷战”复炽，希望我们两国保持紧张关系。
    而美国的显要军事活动家说些什么呢？显然由于劳动分工的关系，他们更大声地谈论轰炸机、氢弹和原子弹，谈论在几小时之内或者几天之内能够破坏苏联的极重要的目标，给苏联以致命的打击等等。一句话，最狂妄和最好战的美国将领们都在谈论准备发动热战，谈论消灭人和毁灭物质财富。
    同时，美国军政界人士经常说，美国在军事方面的条件比苏联有利，因为他们在欧洲国家和亚洲国家境内拥有可以对我们国家发动进攻的整套军事基地网，而苏联，据他们说，洲际火箭还少。因此，据说，战争对美国来讲威胁性不那么大。例如，美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊最近说，美国将从接近苏联国界的美国盟国境内出击，而苏联只能靠从自己境内发射火箭。
    应当设想，英国人、法国人、德国人、土耳其人、希腊人、意大利人以及设有美国军事基地的其他国家的人民，已经注意到这种前景对他们预示着什么。
    如果战略计划建立在错误的基础上，就会干出失算的事，对和平事业造成严重的后果。如果一个国家认为，在一定时期内敌方没有一种武器能够袭击它的领土，它就会忍不住要利用这个有利时机来发动战争。如果美国某些人士认为他们的领土现在受不到损害，他们就会以为发动战争的适当时机已经到来了。在这场战争中，英国人、法国人、意大利人、德国人、土耳其人以及美国的其他同盟者将付出鲜血和生命，战争一旦爆发，他们的领土将被中程和短程火箭夷为焦土。而美国自己呢，据这些眼光十分短浅的军事“战略家”认为，能够防止自己的国家遭到破坏。
    美国活动家为了自己的狭隘利益准备牺牲自己的盟友，无视人类的命运——这是一种生意经态度，是一种鲜血贩子的政策，这些鲜血贩子为了发财不仅打算出卖朋友，而且准备出卖自己的亲爸爸。
    不用说，这种政策对我国人民、对我们苏维埃国家、对于工人阶级、对于站在马克思列宁主义立场上的人来说，是格格不入的。我们百折不挠地进行斗争，来争取防止战争危险、禁止原子武器和氢武器以及停止试验这些武器，争取在所有极端重要问题上同美、英、法和其他西方国家达成互相可以接受的协议。我们在为争取世界和平而斗争，因为我们珍视一切人，不管他属于什么民族，不管他的肤色或信仰如何。我们认为，把一些人、一些民族的幸福建筑在别人的不幸和痛苦上面，这是犯罪。我们认为，希望遥远的或邻近的一些国家的人民遭受极大的不幸，并且毫无理由地指望在这上面建筑另一些人的幸福，这是不行的。
    假如美国的政治家和军事活动家从全人类的愿望出发，而不是从利己的算盘出发，那么，这不仅会有利于美国人民，而且会有利于世界各国人民。
    我认为，现在是时候了，美国战略家该停止把自己的盘算建立在下列幻想上，即幻想一旦发生军事冲突，美国可以安然无恙。这一点早就不符合现实，而只不过是美国将军们的痴心妄想。要知道苏联现在事实上已拥有能给地球上任何一点的侵略者以毁灭性的打击的手段。我们说我们已组织了洲际弹道火箭的成批生产，这不是开玩笑。我们说出这一点也不是为了要吓唬什么人，而是为了要把事情的真实情况讲清楚。
    我们的七年计划最令人信服地证明了苏联爱好和平的意图。我们需要和平，我们坚持不懈地、始终不渝地为和平而奋斗。世界各国人民都渴望和平。因此，苏联的和平政策得到全世界如此深切的尊重和支持。
    同志们！在和缓国际紧张局势方面，改善美苏两国的关系具有特别重大的意义。不很久之前，苏联政府和美国政府曾经互换了相当尖锐的信件。这是因为，当时谈的是国际局势中非常尖锐的问题。美国的某些行动引起爱好和平的人民的不安，我们不能不对这种行动表示我们的态度。
    现在，这些事件已经成为往事。我们应当向前看。苏联政府方面在尽一切可能来缓和国际紧张局势以及改善同各国的关系。我们相信，如果美国总统和其他领导人像他们在同米高扬交谈时所说的那样，真正希望和平，那么他们就会承认各国和平共处的必要性，并且在这个基础上同苏联和其他社会主义国家建立关系。
    为了改善相互谅解和建立各国之间的友好关系，扩大贸易联系和文化联系以及国家活动家和社会活动家的直接接触能够起重大的作用。
    大家都记得，四大国领导人于1955年夏天在日内瓦的会见在全世界引起了多么广泛的社会反应。爱好和平的人们把这次会见看作是缓和国际紧张局势的重要步骤。
    我在日内瓦同艾森豪威尔先生的会晤和谈话留下了良好的印象。我认为，艾森豪威尔先生虽然是一位将军，但是他不是那类在解决争端问题时光靠大炮和想要用武力解决一切问题的军人。他曾经不止一次地说过，他在致力于防止战争。我们重视这一点，并且希望他的话能够在具体行动中表现出来。
    米高扬同志在美国进行的访问，使人有理由希望我们两国之间的关系能进一步“缓和起来”。希望能发展接触和联系。顺便提一下，米高扬同志是利用他的休假去美国访问的。不过，他的意思，还是让他在苏联休假的好。（全场活跃，掌声）他这次访问在某种程度上使我们两国关系中的温度由零下上升到零度和零度以上；温度已开始上升，它的方向是要达到适应集体正常生活要求的度数。显然，有些政治活动家是不喜欢这一点的，因而企图贬低米高扬同志的访问对美国社会舆论的积极影响。
    美国不来继续扩大这种接触，反而与此背道而驰。艾森豪威尔总统在1月28日的记者招待会上，答复一个记者提出的我是否能像阿·伊·米高扬那样去访问美国的问题时干脆了当地说，这是不可能的。他说：
  “赫鲁晓夫不能像米高扬先生那样来作非正式的访问”。可见，对米高扬用的是一种尺度，而对我用的却是另外一种尺度。
    这真是一个十分意外的结论。这有点近乎歧视了。一个人可以享受大家所享有的那种权利，可是另一个人却被剥夺了这种权利。
    请正确地理解我的意思。我完全不打算请求发给这种访问的签证。我们这里事情很忙。此外，我接到的邀请十分多，很难腾出时间来一一进行访问。因此，问题不在于我想不想访问美国，而是牵涉到另外一个问题，即人权的问题。令人费解的是，总统究竟认为我有什么过错而不许我像其他获准访问美国的人一样享有同样的权利呢。
    至于我们苏联人，对这类问题倒抱有另一种态度。每当外国的政治家和旅行者来我们这里访问时，我们是感到很高兴的。
    最近几年，一些美国代表团、国会议员和旅行者访问了苏联，而一些苏联人去访问了美国，这是一件好事情，值得欢迎。我国人民殷勤地接待了美国人，美国人民也对我们的人表现了很友好的态度。这一点在米高扬同志访美期间表现得特别明显。如果总统先生决定来我国的话，他会受到我国政府和苏联人民真挚的接待。他高兴带谁来都可以，他们都将是受欢迎的客人，让总统先生看看苏联地图，选出他愿意在我国访问的地区。我们的国家辽阔广大，有趣的地方多得很，有可观光的处所，有可看的东西。毫无疑问，这种访问对我们两国都是有益的，并且会得到美国和苏联人民的拥护。我们作这样的邀请，并不要求回请。（全场活跃、掌声）
    我们的出发点是，国家领导人和社会活动家彼此举行会见、会谈和互相访问有助于改善国家之间的关系，形成使人身心感到温暖的气氛，使人过日子不必为将来而恐惧，以便杜绝战争和保障和平共处。
    应该把国际关系中的“疙瘩”解开，首先是缔结对德和约，解决柏林问题。
    各国人民不要“冷战”，因此也没有理由在国际关系中保持各种各样的“疙瘩”，应该把这些疙瘩解开。我指的首先是缔结对德和约，解决柏林问题。这些问题如果根据我们的建议加以解决，并不会让任何一方占便宜，可是却会为消除“冷战”，为解决裁军问题创造条件，会为建立不以战争作为解决争端手段的国际关系创造条件。
    国务卿杜勒斯说，美国在同苏联的谈判中不能让步，如果他们让步的话，那么这不会导致消除“冷战”，而只能使苏联赢得这场“战争”。在这方面我们可以告诉杜勒斯先生：我们不要求谁对我们作什么让步，我们希望相互了解，以便对理智让步，苏联既不愿意自己也不愿意美国赢得这场“冷战”，而且一般说来，“冷战”是不可能取胜的。同时它对所有的人都是危险的。如果以为，苏联在“冷战”中得到了某种优势而美国失去了这种优势的话，那么在这种情况下“冷战”就不会结束，因为美国为了挽回失去的优势，将会继续执行自己的政策。
    如果想在“冷战”中得到什么胜利，那么冷战就不会结束，甚至更糟，它会变成军事冲突。各国政府应当表现出停止“冷战”的意愿，首先应当明白，我们生活在一个行星上，而在现代技术发展水平之下这个行星的面积是十分有限的，因此应当谨慎行事，尽一切办法保证和平共处。
    我们只是希望一点，就是尽快地结束“冷战”。杜勒斯先生，如果您愿意这样做的话，那么为了结束冷战，我们甚至准备承认你们在这场各国人民所不需要的战争中取得“胜利”。先生们，请你们把自己当作这场“战争”的“胜利者”吧，只是尽快地结束“冷战”就好。
    必须把妨害社会制度不同的各国和平共处的一切障碍，从道路上清除出去。当窄小挤脚的靴子擦破了士兵的脚，妨碍他以士兵步伐走路时，就得重新穿一下靴子，再不行的话就要换掉这双靴子了。
    在政策方面也必须这样做，必须取消一切恶化国际局势和妨碍和平共处的政策。重新武装西德的政策目前就是这种障碍。苏联关于缔结对德和约的建议使杜勒斯有了借口说，苏联在争取“冷战”中的胜利。但是，当缔结和约时，到底谁胜谁负呢？胜利的将是一切热心于保障和平的人，失败的将是那些不希望和平的人。当然，和约并不是“冷战”中的巧计，而是各国人民的共同事业。如果美国在和约草案的准备方面走在我们的前面，而不是去寻找借口来逃避谈判，那末我们决不会责怪和怀疑他们有什么自私自利的打算。
    苏联表现了主动，提出了自己的对德和约草案。如果美国对这个草案有意见或有某些特别希望应该在和约中反映出来的话，那末谁也没有阻碍他们发表自己的意见。建议召开和会正是为了这一点。
    因此，我们吁请美国和其他西方国家的领导人正确地估计苏联旨在巩固和平的各项建议。
    譬如西柏林问题，杜勒斯说：西柏林不能交出来。试问，交给谁呢？难道苏联的建议中谈到了什么交出西柏林的事吗？
    如果西柏林不是在德意志民主共和国中心的一个不安和冲突的策源地，那也就不会有柏林问题了。但是，今天西柏林的状况可能会发生各种不愉快的事。可以把这种状况比作火药库中一根燃着的导火线，或一枚延期炸弹，这种炸弹的装置，随时都可以引起爆炸。我们为什么要保持这样状况呢？把导火线熄灭，把延期炸弹拿开，岂不更好吗？很难找到别的既符合两个德国的利益、又不致使其它有关国家抱怨和给它们带来损失的解决办法。把西柏林变成自由城市，现在就可能是这种解决办法。这种解决办法不触及这个城市的既成的生活基础，并且可以在相应的保证下排除外力对它的内政的干涉的可能性。
    因此，我们准备同美国、英国、法国一道参加拟定一种原则，这种原则要能够保证西柏林的正常发展，保证这个城市同它所愿意建立关系的一切国家的联系，保证这些国家出入自由城市。我们并且同意联合国参加遵守自由城市的地位，并且愿意讨论它可以在哪一种方式下参与这件事。当然，这种建议的拟定和它们的解决应该在德意志民主共和国的参加下进行。因为，柏林位于它的领土上。我们认为，把西柏林变成非军事化的自由城市，将创造解决其他争端问题的条件，并将有助于保证欧洲安全，也就是全世界的安全。
    我可能又在重复了，但是，在我们没有能使有关方面了解到局势的全部严重性、考虑到继续保持这种局面将造成什么结果、以及正确地了解这个问题以前，我们不得不一再重复这个问题。苏联将不会放松努力来达到所提出的目标。
    同志们，请允许我在我们代表大会的讲台上呼吁德国人民支持旨在巩固欧洲和平和各国人民安全的建议。
    在最近半世纪以来，德国帝国主义曾经两次把德国人民抛进血腥的世界大战的深渊。许多国家的人民都被卷进了这两次战争。但是牺牲最大的是我国各族人民和德国人民。不知洒下了多少鲜血和眼泪，我们两国遭到了多么惨重的破坏！
    希特勒在民族主义和沙文主义宣传机构的帮助下策划和发动了第二次世界大战。他硬要德国人认为德国至上，德国人是超等种族，德国必须把它的“生存空间”不多不少地恰恰扩大到乌拉尔。大家知道，希特勒的军事进攻的下场如何。德国人给欧洲人民带来了巨大的灾难，但是他们遭到了完全的失败。现在，遗憾的是，西德一些侵略成性的政客们想走希特勒的老路。显然，他们没有接受什么历史教训，他们企图第三次发动德国人民进行侵略战争。
    帝国主义的头子们由于憎恨那些正在顺利地发展本国经济和文化、提高自己福利的社会主义国家的人民，变得晕头转向。他们竟想首先依靠德国人来阻挡历史前进，使历史的车轮倒转。但是，在有原子武器和氢武器的情况下，在火箭技术的情况下，这种企图是愚蠢不智的，这不仅使千百万人遭到毁灭，而且会使整个民族、整个国家遭到毁灭。同时，西德参与对社会主义国家的侵略战争会不可避免地使它处在这样一种状况，即德国将首先遭到这种武器的打击，而且积存起来的大部分氢武器将落在德国土地上。
    我们希望德国的工人、农民、知识分子，以及西德各政党的领导人和德意志联邦共和国的国家活动家懂得，他们在下面这件事上负有多么大的责任：西德朝哪个方向发展——朝继续维持国际军事冲突的策源地的方向发展呢，还是朝取消这些策源地以便为社会制度不同的国家建立友好关系扫清道路的方向发展呢。
    勤劳和天才的德国人民向全世界贡献了许多伟大的思想家和卓越的科学家、诗人、音乐家。德国人民建立了强大的工业并且保证了高的生活水平，并且不是在希特勒和戈培尔推动德国人民侵占别国领土的情况下做到这一点的。难道这还不说明，德国人民应当在和平劳动的土地上，而不是在战场上去寻求自己的未来。如果现有的紧张局势得到消除，如果德意志联邦共和国政府将促进同苏联、中华人民共和国及其他社会主义国家，同世界上所有国家发展经济关系，那末，德国人民将会有更大的余地发挥自己的力量。他们就能够提高自己的经济，提高自己的物质福利和增加本民族的物质和精神财富。
    遗憾的是，西德总理阿登纳先生朝着另一方面看，他只指望继续“冷战”和实行“实力”政策。总理先生，您拿着鱼竿坐在河岸上，等待着鱼来上钩，而且要钓的是这条河里根本没有的鱼。不是到了您该放弃无法实现的空想的时候了吗。
    阿登纳先生说，如果苏联不为合作付出代价的话，德意志联邦共和国就不同苏联合作。总理先生，不要像食品杂货铺里的商人那样来对待政治。没有理由让我们付出代价，我们不欠你们债。我们希望您明白，对德意志联邦共和国来说，除了同东西方的毗邻国家和平合作之外，不可能有别的明智政策，您自己也好，求助于您的盟国也好，都不能够消灭东德的社会主义制度。
    东德的德国人不愿意老日子再回来。我们以了解的心情对待他们的利益，我们过去支持德意志民主共和国，将来也还要支持它。不难设想，东德的德国人也坚决地认为消除西德现存的制度是正确的。但是，问题的这种提法是不现实的，因为社会变革是由人民自己实现的，这里是不能有任何买卖的。
    应当以符合当前历史时机的现实政策为基础。如果不了解这一点，而按老样子行事，感觉不到生活的呼吸和脉搏，那么，这可能给千百万人民带来灾难。我们愿意倾听你们的建议。如果这些建议合理，我们同意坐到一张桌子上来讨论你们和我们的建议，以便寻求双方都能接受的缔结协定的基础，并且签订协定。
    但是，如果你们提出的条件是要消灭德意志民主共和国，要并吞它，要取消德意志民主共和国劳动人民的社会果实的话，那末这种条件我们连讨论也不会去讨论的。如果我们这样做，那就是僣越职权，因为这就是干涉别人的事务。　每个国家的人民都应该自己来决定，什么社会制度适合于他们。他在什么时候作出决定，那是他们的事情。如果两个德国的人民同意举行西方国家大谈特谈的所谓自由选举，我们也不反对举行这种选举，但是，不得有第三者的干涉。可以预料，经过一定时期，德国人将想举行自由选举，以便消灭西德的资本主义制度。看来，阿登纳总理不能允许有这种想法，而这种作法是完全可能的。然而这是德国人自己的事情。
    这里顺便谈谈自由选举问题。西方国家的统治集团是用自己的眼光来看这种选举的。大家知道，在1954年举行的日内瓦会议上，关于在南越和北越举行自由选举以实现这个国家的和平统一问题达成了协议。但是，南越傀儡政府在美国的支持下破坏了这种选举。
    苏联准备随时达成停止原子武器和氢武器试验的协议，但是西方却准备根本破坏这个问题的解决。
    同志们！现在我想谈这样一个问题，我们认为这个问题是重要的国际问题之一。我指的是停止原子武器和氢武器试验的问题。
    去年夏天在日内瓦就下面问题举行了专家会议：如何侦察核爆炸，如果签订了停止核试验的协议，如何保证签订协议的各方严格遵守这一协议。会议的结果完全证实了苏联的看法：任何核爆炸都是完全可以侦察的，不论这种爆炸是在什么地方进行。最有权威的专家，其中包括苏联的、美国的和英国的，拟订了关于侦察原子弹和氢弹爆炸的监督制度的具体建议。
    我们对专家的有成效的工作感到高兴。苏联政府完全赞同日内瓦会议一致通过的结论和建议。当时我们曾有这样一种印象：我们将可以痛痛快快不再拖延地同美国和英国缔结关于永远停止试验核武器的协定。
    可惜，结果却不是这样。苏联、美国和英国三国政府的代表为了制订和缔结关于停止试验的条约，在日内瓦开了三个多月的会。但事情并无进展。根据这一会谈进行的情况看来，显然，我们的对手是抱定目的不让达成协定的。
    根据什么我作出这种结论呢？根据是很多的。
    首先，美国在英国的全力支持下，企图在实质上抹杀去年夏天日内瓦专家会议所取得的有益成果。美国政府起先曾同意专家们的结论，后来又突然发表声明，说出现了什么“新的材料”，说什么侦察地下核爆炸要比过去所设想的困难。实际上，事情恰恰相反，越往后，各种核爆炸就越加容易侦察出来，因为侦察核爆炸的技术在日益完善。
    我们相信，所以要重新考虑专家的建议，全是为了阻挠签订停止试验原子武器和氢武器的协议。
    不能不得出这样的结论：美国和英国在讨论为履行停止试验的条约而建立监督制度问题时所提出的要求，也是在追求同样的目的。
    请你们判断一下，他们想得到的是什么！他们想要使所说的侦察爆炸的监督岗全部配备外国人，使外国调查人员可以畅行无阻地在条约参加国的全部领土上走来走去。他们还想造成这种局面：使这些监督岗和调查人员所属的监督委员会，能够以西方国家代表所占的硬性的多数地位，强迫通过触犯苏联安全利益的决定。
    但是，试问：这一切同美国总统艾森豪威尔为了使美国人能够随意在苏联全境上空飞行和摄影而提出的建议又有什么不同呢？再则，这同所谓“巴鲁克计划”又有什么不同呢？这个计划实际上规定建立美国垄断组织对包括苏联在内的各国生产原子裂变材料的监督。大家知道，这些建议已遭到拒绝。同样，我们现在也拒绝这种建议，因为我们不能容许别人侵犯苏维埃国家的安全和主权。这一点我们决不会同意的。满足美国和英国代表团现在在日内瓦提出的这种无理要求，那就是同意西方国家在我国领土上布下一个名副其实的情报网。
    有人会说，美国和英国提出自己的建议时，也容许在自己的领土上建立这种监督制度。这样说也许是对的，但是我们不需要侦察它们的领土，因为我们并不打算进行战争。我们在美国的周围，无论在墨西哥、加拿大或是邻近美国的其他国家，都没有军事基地。
    苏联在其他国家的领土上根本没有军事基地，因为我们认为，建立这种基地，特别是在离本国领土十万八千里以外的地方建立这种基地，不是准备战争，就是准备侵略。西方国家用它们的军事基地包围我们以后，现在又力求进而在我们的领土上建立自己的军事侦察基地和取得对苏联领土进行空中侦察的权利，以便通过这种侦察看准时机来使用自己的军事基地向我国进攻。它们还想要我们来帮助它们实现这些阴谋哩。先生们，这不是有点太过分了吗？（全场活跃，掌声）
    如果这个国家的领导人关心本国的利益，关心本国人民的安全，如果他们的头脑清醒，难道他们可以接受这样的要求吗？这是对祖国的犯罪行为。
    我们认为西方国家对我们提出这样的要求是对苏联的恶意强求。如果西方国家说，它们没有恶意，我就建议他们：放弃自己的强求，不进行那些引起我们怀疑的行动。
    我们主张对停止核试验建立适当的监督。苏联在目前的日内瓦会议上提出了关于这种监督的建议。但是，我们不许西方国家在监督的幌子下侵犯我国的主权。如果美国和英国放弃它们的不理智的要求，苏联准备提供一切条件，使有外国代表参加的监督岗有效地进行工作，使仪器能安设起来并加以使用。
    大家知道，就是在目前，当没有任何国际监督的时候，苏联、美国和英国所进行的核爆炸也并不是别人发现不了的。例如，美国所进行的爆炸，为设在苏联境内的监察仪器所侦知，而我们的爆炸也可以被美国测出来。现在是要建立广泛的监督岗网，以便侦察在那些未设监督岗的国家境内进行的爆炸。但是西方国家还要求进行一些突然侦察，要求他们的监察人员有在苏联全境不受限制地往来的权利。
    难道还不明显，这种监督体系的领导人将变成军事情报的首脑。他随时可以说，他怀疑在他所感到兴趣的地区发生了爆炸，于是就可以派专门的考察团来侦察这个地区。每一个人，就连最没有经验的政治家和国家领导人也明白这样做会造成什么样的结果。这将造成不良的后果：造成条约参加国之间关系的恶化。
    我们并不要求给自己任何特殊地位。我们所唯一争取的是同西方国家真正平等的条件。而美国和英国，即北大西洋公约组织军事集团，想要靠损害苏联的利益来使自己得到单方面的好处。
    互相监督的广度同各国关系中的信任程度密切相关。信任越大，就越容易达成广泛监督的协议。当然，在绝对信任的情况下根本不需要监督。
    在苏联周围继续存在着北大西洋公约组织的很多军事基地的情况下，在美国、英国所拼凑的侵略性军事集团——北大西洋公约组织和巴格达条约等所有的参加国就连同苏联和其他社会主义国家的普通贸易关系也加以限制的情况下，难道可以允许提出进行无限监督的强迫要求吗？有人指责我们，说我们利用贸易来达到政治目的，但是事实上，正是美国完全为了政治目的差不多停止了同社会主义国家的贸易。它们的经济利益恰恰要求发展贸易，西方国家的实业界是主张发展贸易的。
    同志们，关于停止试验原子武器和氢武器问题的谈判，情况就是这样。在日内瓦，我们的谈判对方提出明知不能被接受的建议，显然是想阻止这个问题的解决，就像他们在防止突然袭击问题上所作的那样，实际上他们已经使防止突然袭击的问题陷入僵局。看来，在关于停止试验的会议上，他们也打算一直拖延下去，直到准备好舆论来破坏谈判，而后根本破坏这一极为重要问题的解决。
    但愿我的预言不会应验。至于苏联，我想重申我们希望尽速达成停止核试验协议的愿望。我们准备随时签订关于这个问题的条约，这个条约应该以合理的条件为基础，并保证对爆炸进行必要的监督。
    各国兄弟党在马克思列宁主义基础上团结一致。南斯拉夫修正主义者的挑拨伎俩是多么卑劣，在某种程度上很像沙皇俄国时代一些惯于撒谎的销售黄色报刊的报贩。
    同志们，大会代表的发言以及各兄弟共产党和工人党代表团领导人的贺词显示了完全一致和国际主义团结的精神，表明了在国际共产主义运动和工人运动一切问题上观点的一致。在大会上发言的人都确认共产党和工人党会议宣言的论点的正确性，谈到了各国兄弟党在马克思列宁主义基础上的团结一致，谈到了它们为反对修正主义这种目前的主要危险所作的坚决斗争。
    非常值得注意的是，我们代表大会的工作在国际共产主义运动中和在进步公众中间引起了巨大的兴趣和赞同，但是却使南斯拉夫修正主义者极为恼怒。在南斯拉夫的报刊上出现了一些文章，文章中拙劣地企图为修正主义政策辩解，企图对南斯拉夫人民隐瞒苏联有同南斯拉夫合作的愿望，企图歪曲南斯拉夫和社会主义国家之间所形成的那种关系的真相。南斯拉夫领导人正在用他们的修正主义政策来分裂为劳动人民根本利益而奋斗的工人阶级的革命力量。
    关于我们对南斯拉夫领导人的修正主义政策造成了何种后果的全部看法，他们说不出任何明确的东西来。他们感到自己的立场软弱无力，于是就采取了惯用的手法——恶意地说好像苏联在干涉他们的内政。但这是诽谤。大家清楚地知道，我们一直坚持不干涉其他国家和党的事务的立场。我们在我们这次代表大会上再一次十分明确地申明了这一点。
    但是请看一看，现在南斯拉夫修正主义者竟然采取了怎样的卑劣和挑拨的伎俩，妄图损害社会主义国家的团结。报告中已经指出，南斯拉夫修正主义者进行各种捏造，说我们党和中国共产党之间存在着分歧。最近，他们更进了一步，显然是为了给自己的捏造找根据，居然请来了美国参议员休伯特·汉弗莱这等“可靠的见证人”兼“苏联和中华人民共和国之间分歧”问题的专家。大家知道，这位参议员不久前曾访问过苏联，并且同我进行了谈话。为了耸人听闻，汉弗莱在他的谈话和文章中大放谎言骗语，说什么他给艾森豪威尔总统带来了一封苏联政府的专函（当然，根本就没有任何函件），又说我向他透露了两个特别重要的秘密。真的，我可找不到比汉弗莱先生更好的对象来透露秘密了！（全场活跃）当参议员汉弗莱开始胡诌苏联和中华人民共和国的关系时，他那奔放的幻想力特别不可遏止了。在这里，他甚至超过了有名的撒谎大师慕恩好森男爵。
    南斯拉夫修正主义者就请了这样一位捏造者来充当见证人。如果以为我会对一个自己吹嘘有二十年反共历史的人抱着某种信任的态度，这自然是可笑的。每一个稍稍懂得一点政治的人都会明白（更不用说懂得马克思列宁主义的人了），同汉弗莱先生推心置腹地谈论共产党的政策以及我们同我们的好朋友——中国共产党领导人——的相互关系问题，是很难想像的。　南斯拉夫修正主义者收集了形形色色的谬论，可见，他们的事情是多么糟糕了。　说到这里，我想起了沙皇俄国时代一些会钻营的报贩销售黄色报刊的情况。这些报贩常常一面跑一面喊：
    “天下奇闻！一个女人生了个长胡子的女儿！……”　当然，没有经验的读者会立刻跑过去买一份报来寻找这件奇闻，但是根本找不到这种消息。可是报贩卖掉了报纸，就算完事了。　我认为，参议员汉弗莱和他的谎言的南斯拉夫散布者，在某种程度上很像这种销售黄色报刊的报贩。　当有人谈到南斯拉夫劳动人民生活水平低的时候，南斯拉夫领导人非常神经过敏。
    自从代表大会的报告发表以后，南斯拉夫报刊企图推翻报告中一些关于南斯拉夫劳动人民生活水平的材料。但是，事实是推翻不了的。可以举出许多其他材料来证实我们关于南斯拉夫劳动人民生活水平没有提高的论点。
    譬如，大家知道，不很久以前，南斯拉夫的消费品价格和公用事业费用又有一次猛涨。尽管同时也提高了工资，但是工资的提高决不能补偿物价的上涨。因此，居民生活水平进一步下降了。而在社会主义阵营国家中，人民群众的福利不断增进。谁也不能否认这些事实。
    有些人企图用各种统计材料来使人感觉到仿佛南斯拉夫劳动人民的生活水平很高，对于这些人只能说：请你们问问人民，看他们根据亲身体会如何估计自己的物质生活水平，是在提高还是在降低呢，如果是提高了，那么同社会主义阵营国家生活水平的提高相比较，程度又如何呢。人民对这个问题将会给予明确的答复。我们对南斯拉夫人民表示同情，他们的生活水平的确落后于社会主义国家。他们不得不为自己领导人的政策而付出代价。　　由于南斯拉夫报刊对于我们的代表大会上向南斯拉夫劳动人民表示的友好感情缄口不言，所以我再一次声明：我们对兄弟的南斯拉夫各族人民和南斯拉夫共产党人从事地下斗争和游击斗争的英雄们，怀着最友好的感情。苏联今后仍将努力在国家关系方面，在反对帝国主义、争取和平的问题上同南斯拉夫合作，在凡是我们双方的立场将吻合的一切问题上进行合作。
    国际生活的问题就是这样，我认为在自己的总结发言中谈到这些问题是适宜的。（掌声）
    同志们！第二十一次代表大会要通过共产主义建设的宏伟纲领。我们党、英雄的苏联人民将完成巨大的事业。七年计划的完成，将使我国达到这样的高度，以至谁也不会丝毫怀疑共产主义对过了时的资本主义的巨大优越性。　（经久不息的掌声）
    我们都有权为在不朽的列宁的领导下克服了难以想像的困难、建立了我们光荣的共产党的一代人，为在共产党的领导下完成了伟大十月社会主义革命，并以此开辟了人类历史的新纪元的一代人而自豪。（暴风雨般的掌声）我们为奠立了首批基石并筑起了社会主义高楼大厦的一代人自豪。我们的同时代人将要实现人类的理想——建立起共产主义社会、世界上最公正的社会。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    千秋万世将会过去，但是我们英雄的时代——建设社会主义和共产主义的时代的荣耀将永远不会减色！　（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
    同志们！沿着列宁主义的道路向共产主义的胜利前进！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声、转为热烈欢呼。全场起立）
