Tao Mei

Zhang Yongmei

I

Eyebrows curved and slender,
Lips painted red with betel nut,
The girl is called Tao Mei,
Living in the depths of the mountains…

This folk song is sung by the Li ethnic villagers, and also by the soldiers guarding the mountaintop.

This mountain is a rocky mountain, without even a mountain spring. Going up eight *li* and down eight *li* is steep and dangerous, feeling like more than fifteen *li* in all. The People's Liberation Army had an important task to perform, and each person was working at their best, one shift after another. The cooks were exhausted from going up and down the mountain, and there wasn't enough water. As the poem says:

A basin of water, many uses,
After washing the face, then wash the feet,
After washing clothes, water the flowers,
Flowers bloom in the cracks of the rocks.

The cook, covered in sweat, poured the water brought from the foot of the mountain into the tank: Oh! It's already full! The cook thought it was a soldier who had helped out during their rest, without asking; in the army, this was already a common occurrence.

The next day, it was full again! The third day, it was full again!

The soldiers surrounded the cook: "You're really like you have three heads and six arms, there's been plenty of water these past few days; no wonder you're a model soldier!" The cook was stunned: "Wasn't it you guys who carried it?"

Who was it? Two soldiers on dawn patrol said: "It must be her! I saw her coming up the mountain, carrying water buckets. When I asked her what she was doing, she said she was coming up to work – it must be her!"

"Who is she?"

"Tao Mei!"

II

Tao Mei carries water up the mountain. The water buckets are covered with banana leaves. Tao Mei carries water up the mountain, passing through clouds and fog. When going up the mountain, the moon is on her right; when going down the mountain, the sun is on her left. The sun and moon light her way!

Tao Mei sings softly, and the birds on the rocks, on the betel nut trees, sing along:

If not to the great army, to whom should we be close?
Crossing the sea and climbing mountains to perform duties.
The rocky mountain lacks water,
Like fire burning the Li people's hearts!
We would rather get up early and sleep less,
Shouldering a carrying pole to fetch water,
Carrying clear water to water the flowers,
May the flowers of friendship bloom beautifully.

III

The tide rises and falls, the swallows come and go. Tao Mei is even closer to these soldiers. Tao Mei is also becoming more sensible.

When new recruits are transferred here, Tao Mei greets them at the village entrance at the foot of the mountain. Helping to carry backpacks and satchels. Warmly shaking hands, she introduces them to the new recruits like a veteran: "This mountain, eight *li* up and eight *li* down... that tall guy is from Henan, has a big temper, you better not mess with him, if you make a mistake he'll scold you. Also, you have to do me a favor, ask the squad leader to teach me how to shoot, they never teach me... I have a lot of opinions..."

The new recruits understood every word. Tao Mei now speaks Mandarin, also mixing in some Northeastern dialect.

IV

The People's Commune was established. Tao Mei is the militia platoon leader.

The tall Henan soldier was sent to be a military instructor: "Tao Mei, let's practice rifle drills this afternoon!"

Tao Mei pretended not to hear, and after a while laughed: "In the past, I wanted to learn to shoot, but you wouldn't teach me, now you're coming to me!"

V

The sea weaves white lace at the foot of the mountain, and the soldiers and militia are "jointly training" on the top of the mountain. The sound of water, gunfire, and wind shake the clouds in the sky.

"Charge!" The one holding a red flag and running at the front of the militia is none other than Tao Mei. As the poem says:

A flash of light,
Seeing Tao Mei,
Flag flying above her head,
Gun held in her hand.
Like a phoenix,
She is braver than a phoenix;
Like an eagle,
She is more beautiful than an eagle...

    陶妹
    张永枚
    一
    眉儿弯又细，
    槟榔涂唇红，
    姑娘叫陶妹，
    住在万山中。……
    这山歌黎族老乡会唱，守卫在山顶的几个大军也会唱。
    这山是石头山，连山泉也没有。上八里下八里，又陡又险，走起来好像十五里出头。解放军要执行重要的勤务，人是一个顶一个，一班接一班，炊事员上山下山累坏了，水也不够用。有诗为证：
    一盆水，用处多，
    洗过脸，又洗脚，
    洗过衣裳再浇花，
    石头缝里开花朵。
    炊事员满头大汗，把从山下弄来的水往缸里倒：哟！已经满了！炊事员以为是那个战士没休息帮的忙，没有打听；在部队里，这已是习以为常的事。
    第二天，又满了！第三天，又满了！
    战士们围着炊事员：“你真像有三头六臂，这几天水总用不完；难怪你是标兵！”炊事员一楞：“不是你们挑的？”
    是谁呀？两个在拂晓值班的战士说：“一定是她！我看见她上山来了，担着水桶。问她干啥，她说，上来出勤——一定是她！”
    “她是谁呀？”
    “陶妹呀！”
    二
    陶妹挑水上山。水桶里盖着一片芭蕉叶。陶妹挑水上山，穿云过雾。上山时，月亮在她右边，下山时，太阳在她左边。日月给她照路哩！
    陶妹轻轻唱，小鸟在石头上，在槟榔树上，和着唱：
    大军不亲谁个亲？
    渡海翻山来执勤。
    石头山上缺水用，
    好比火烧黎家心！
    宁愿早起少睡觉，
    一根扁担把水挑，
    担起清水把花浇，
    友谊花儿开得好。
    三
    海水涨潮落潮，燕子来了又去。陶妹跟这几个战士更亲密了。陶妹也更懂事了。
    新兵调到这儿来，陶妹在山下村口去迎接。帮忙扛背包，背挂包。亲亲热热地握着手，活像一个老兵似的向新兵作介绍：“这山呀，上八里下八里，……那个大个子是河南人，脾气大，你可别乱惹他，缺点犯在他手头，要挨骂哩。还有，你得帮我一个忙，叫班长教我打枪，他们总不教我……我的意见老鼻子了……”
    新兵一句一句都听懂了。陶妹现在讲的是普通话，还夹着句把东北土话呢。
    四
    人民公社成立了。陶妹是民兵排长。
    大个子河南战士被派去当军事教员：“陶妹，下午进行骑枪预习吧！”
    陶妹故意装作没听见，好一会才噗吃一笑：“过去我要学枪，你们不教我，现在找上门来了！”
    五
    海水在山脚织白花边，战士们和民兵在山顶进行“合练”。水声、枪声、风声，震得天上的云朵乱飞。
    “冲呀！”那打着一面红旗，挺胸跑在民兵最前面的不是别人，正是陶妹。有诗为证：
    火光一闪亮，
    望见陶妹子，
    旗在头上飞，
    枪在手中端。
    好比一只凤，
    她比凤勇敢；
    好比一只鹰，
    她比鹰美丽。……（附图片）
