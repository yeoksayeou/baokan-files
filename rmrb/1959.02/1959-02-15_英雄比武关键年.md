Key Year for Heroes' Skills Competition
	He Wenxia
	Create miracles, show might
	Make great contributions on the production battlefield
	Heroes gather for a skills competition
	For an even greater leap forward this year

Speaking of the fifteenth day of the new year of 1959, the Chongqing People's Auditorium was exceptionally lively. The war drums were booming, and good news was spreading everywhere. Looking around, upstairs and downstairs, in the corridors and passages, there were stages set up for competitions everywhere, with huge golden characters dazzlingly eye-catching: "If you are a hero, a true man, come up on stage and compete!" Thousands of heroes from all over the city's steel, machinery, coal, electricity... gathered together, soldier against soldier, general against general, factory against factory, workshop against workshop, individual against individual, challenging and accepting challenges. Big-character posters, red and green, densely packed, what a sight, what an imposing manner! Truly, heroes are emboldened by it, and enemies tremble at the sound.

There were many people and many things happening at the meeting, so let's talk about one thing at a time. Let's start with the flag-bearer of innovation, Liao Shigang. This man is a Communist Party member, dares to think, dares to speak, and dares to act. He once improved work efficiency by thousands of times. The day after the meeting, he rushed back to the factory workshop. He was seen in a hurry, very nervous. What was this about? It turned out that at this time last year, he proposed an amazing leap forward target at the city's Advanced Producers Representative Conference. Only dozens or hundreds of big-character posters dared to challenge him. Who knew that a year later, the scene was completely different: today at the meeting, as soon as his leap forward plan was posted, thousands of big-character posters challenging him were posted with a whoosh, shouting "Catch up with Liao Shigang!" and "Surpass Liao Shigang!" This made him anxious, how could he not be!

Let's leave Liao Shigang returning to the factory for now, and tell two more stories of newly emerging heroes: one is the steel hero Ma Haiqing, and the other is the coal mine hero Wang Zhizhong. As early as September 29th last year, at one o'clock at night, the sound of tapping was heard in the open hearth furnace workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, as the steel tapping began, a golden light flashed, and the molten steel, like a fire dragon, went straight from the tapping hole to the steel ladle. Suddenly, someone shouted: "Not good, the steel is leaking!" Instantly, sparks flew out of the waist door, and a major accident was about to happen. At that critical moment, Ma Haiqing, in one fell swoop, rushed forward, took a steel bar and held the waist door firmly. Steel sparks rained down like a storm. He gritted his teeth until all the molten steel flowed into the steel ladle. Comrades! Last year, we were able to exceed the target of 10.7 million tons of steel, and there are countless tenacious battles fought like Ma Haiqing's! Having spoken of Ma Haiqing, let's talk about Wang Zhizhong. Communist Party member Wang Zhizhong was the rescue team leader of the Zhongliangshan Coal Mine. He had been a miner since he was ten years old and knew the situation underground like the back of his hand. That day, a gas accident occurred in Zhongliangshan. The gas rose three hundred meters from the mine entrance to the ground. The underground was filled with smoke, and the situation was unknown, and production immediately stopped. It would be very dangerous to go down the well to find out the situation. At this time, Wang Zhizhong first requested to go down the well to explore, saying: "I am familiar with the situation underground and guarantee the completion of the exploration task. I was nurtured by the Party, and now, when the Party needs me, even sacrificing myself is glorious." He resolutely went down to the extremely dangerous mine and successfully completed the task and returned safely. It is truly: Heroic boldness as firm as steel, not taking life and death to heart, showing true colors in a critical moment, regarding fire and cliffs as nothing. Such heroes and good men, full of courage and soaring ambition, all competed to be the first at the skills competition. Wang Zhizhong guaranteed the safe production of the mine, and Ma Haiqing wanted to double the steel production; there were also Huang Rongchang who constantly innovated, Zhang Wenjin, the steelmaking expert who created the "step-by-step feeding method", Zhang Lizhen, the textile heroine... Countless heroes and outstanding people jumped onto the stage to compete in skills and show their talents. Whether new heroes or old models, each was as strong as a vajra arhat. Tell me, how could Liao Shigang not be anxious! And how could he not use all his skills to advance side by side with everyone!

Let's return to the story of Liao Shigang. That day, he returned to the factory to "call for reinforcements". He first looked for the Party Committee, then the workers, and then the technicians, thinking of tricks, changing measures, and fighting hard all night. The next day, the heroes were energetic and came by appointment. Liao Shigang posted a new battle declaration on the original challenge, vowing to propose eight hundred innovation proposals this year! The heroes discussed on the spot, rubbing their fists and palms. Just as everyone was thinking about how to accept the challenge, a hero suddenly stepped forward, vowing to achieve eight hundred innovation proposals throughout the year and jump to the forefront. The person who came was none other than Wei Gaohou, a worker from the Chang'an Machine Factory. This young worker was not well-known at this time last year, but this year he became everyone's strong "enemy" on the competition stage! When Liao Shigang first issued the battle declaration, Wei Gaohou overwhelmed Liao Shigang by achieving 500 innovations and creations throughout the year, and this time he was full of fighting spirit and surpassed Liao Shigang again. Everyone! Achieving eight hundred innovations is no simple matter! Is this young man confident? Please rest assured, in the first ten days of January this year, Wei Gaohou, with the help of his comrades, had already achieved seventy-two innovations and creations. Among them, the highest improvement in work efficiency reached more than one thousand six hundred times. Although, when he saw Liao Shigang post that he would implement eight hundred innovation proposals this year, Wei Gaohou was also thinking hard: Can he catch up all at once? Just as he was hesitating, Liao Zhiguo, a sixth-grade fitter and old hero from the same factory, grabbed his arm and said softly: "We must strive for the top and catch up with Liao Shigang! I will give you a hand. Your success is my success. Everyone is for communism!" This old hero pointed out the essence of this chase and competition. These heroes live in the new China, and they do not have the feeling that a hero is helpless alone, nor are there those who are jealous of talent and engage in deceit. Today, there is the help of comrades who are closer than flesh and blood, and the support of communist ideology. Look at the arena, the heroes do not give in to each other, and do not show weakness! After leaving the stage, you teach me this experience, and I help you improve that technology. It is truly: Heroes have great ambitions, why worry about not soaring into the clouds; the skills competition is for the leap forward, not for personal gain.

Just as these heroes were chasing after each other, and Wei Gaohou was fighting hard against Liao Shigang, a hero suddenly flashed onto the stage. Everyone looked up and saw that it was Tang Yuankang from the Jialing Machine Factory. He proposed a new competition condition to everyone: to help ten comrades reach their level this year, and to let more people advance to advanced levels together. Tang Yuankang, really can say it, can do it. That night, he rushed back to the factory and helped five comrades achieve an innovation, catching up with his level. Comrades, look: the old heroes here are still competing, and new heroes in the factory are appearing in large numbers. This year, everyone will strive for a greater leap forward, and who knows how many heroes and outstanding people will appear. This "Key Year for Heroes' Skills Competition" is really endless, so I have to stop for now. If there is a chance, I will continue to report the details. There is a poem to prove it:

	Riding the east wind, straddling the rocket
	Targets soaring straight through the sky
	Thousands of hero flowers bloom
	Each year is redder than the last

    英雄比武关键年
    贺文霞
    创奇迹、显威风
    生产战场立大功
    群英会上来比武
    更大跃进今年中
    话说1959年开年方十五天，重庆市人民礼堂热闹非凡，战鼓咚咚响，捷报四处传。只见那楼上楼下，走廊过道，到处擂台高设，斗大的金字耀眼夺目：“是英雄、是好汉，上台来比比看！”全市的钢铁、机械、煤炭、电业……嘿！各路英雄三千人马，拥聚一堂，兵对兵、将对将，工厂与工厂，车间与车间，个人与个人，挑战应战，大字报红红绿绿、密密层层，好不威风，好不气派！真乃英雄见之气壮，敌人闻之丧胆。
    会场人多事多，话说一头。单说革新旗手廖世刚，此人是共产党员，敢想敢说敢做，一次提高工效就是上千倍。头一天会刚完，他就跑回工厂车间，只见他急急忙忙，十分紧张。这是为了何事？原来去年此时，他在全市先进生产者代表大会上提出惊人的跃进指标，能和他打擂比武的只有几十、百来张大字报，那知事隔一年，景象全非：今天会上，他的跃进规划一贴出，向他应战、挑战的大字报哗啦啦一贴就是几千张，口口声声喊的是“赶上廖世刚！”、“超过廖世刚！”，这叫他怎的不急，怎的不慌！
    表过廖世刚回工厂，回书再把新起的英雄事迹说两桩：一个是钢铁英雄马海清、一个是煤矿豪杰王执中。早在去年9月29日，下夜一点，重钢大平炉车间“当当当”响起了出钢钟声，只见金光闪闪，钢水像条火龙，从出钢口直奔盛钢桶。突然有人大喊一声：“不好，漏钢了！”顿时钢花从腰门眼子飞溅出来，眼看大事故就要发生。说时迟、那时快，在这千钧一发之际，马海清，一个箭步，飞奔上前，拿了根钢钎将腰门死死顶住，钢花急雨般打下来，他咬紧牙、直到钢水全部流入盛钢桶。同志们！去年能超额完成一零七零万吨钢，这里面有数不尽的像马海清这样的顽强战斗！说了马海清，再表王执中。共产党员王执中，本是中梁山煤矿救护队长，此人十岁就当矿工，对井下情况了如指掌。那日，中梁山发生瓦斯事故，瓦斯从井口冒出地面有三百多公尺高，井下烟雾弥漫，情况不明，生产马上停顿。若要下井探明情况，要冒很大危险。此时，王执中首先要求下井探险，他说：“井下情况我熟悉，保证完成探井任务。我是党培养出来的，现在党需要的时候，就是牺牲我个人，也是光荣。”他毅然决然下到危险万端的矿井，结果胜利完成了任务，安全归来。正是：坚如钢铁英雄胆，不把生死放心间，千钧一发显本色，火海危崖视等闲。这样浑身是胆、壮志冲天的英雄好汉，比武会上，个个争先。那王执中保证矿井安全生产，马海清更要钢产加番；还有那不断革新的黄荣昌，创造“分步进料法”的炼钢能手张文金、纺织女英雄张利珍……数不完的英雄豪杰，都纷纷跳上擂台，比武艺，显神通。无论新英雄，老模范，个个都是金刚赛罗汉。你说那廖世刚又怎不着急！？又焉能不使出浑身武艺才能和大家并肩前进！？
    回书且说廖世刚，那日回厂“搬救兵”，他先找党委，又找工人，再找技术员，想窍门，改措施，苦战通宵。第二天，众家英雄精神抖擞，相约来到。只见那廖世刚在原来的挑战书上，又贴上了一张新的战表：要在今年提出革新建议八百项！众英雄当场议论纷纷，摩拳擦掌，大家正在思量应战之时，突然闪出一条好汉，以全年实现八百项革新建议跃到最前面。来者不是别人，乃长安机器厂工人魏高厚。这个年轻工人，去年此时还无多大名气，今年比武台上竟成了众人的劲“敌”！当廖世刚第一次发出战表，魏高厚就以全年实现革新创造五百项压倒廖世刚，这次又斗志昂扬赶过廖世刚。诸位！实现八百项革新不是简单事呵！这小伙子有把握吗？大家请放心，就在今年1月上旬的十天内，魏高厚在同志们的帮助下，已实现了革新创造七十二项。其中提高工效最高的达到一千六百倍以上。虽然，这天看见廖世刚贴出今年革新建议八百项时，魏高厚也煞费思量：能不能一下赶上去呢？正当犹豫之时，突然同厂的老英雄六级钳工廖治国，一把拉住他的胳膊轻声说道：“一定要争上游，赶上廖世刚！我助你一臂之力，你的成功就是我的成功，大家都是为了共产主义！”这老英雄一语道破了这场你追我赶、打擂比武的本质。这些英雄生活在新中国，既无英雄孤掌难鸣之感，又无嫉贤妒能、尔虞我诈之辈。今天有的是亲过骨肉的同志帮助，有的是共产主义思想支持。你看那擂台上面，众家英雄互不相让，互不示弱！下得台来，却是你教我这条经验，我帮你改进那项技术。正是：英雄有壮志，何愁不凌云；比武为跃进，不是为个人。
    就在这众英雄你追我赶、魏高厚奋战廖世刚之时，擂台上“忽”地又闪出一条好汉，大家举目一看乃嘉陵机器厂的唐远康是也。他向大家提出一项新的比武条件：要在今年帮助十个同志达到自己的水平，要让更多的人朝先进水平共同前进。唐远康，真的说得到，做得到。当天晚上，他就赶回工厂，帮助五个同志实现一项革新，赶上了他的水平。同志你看：这里老英雄打擂比武还来不及说，那边厂里的新英雄又大批出现。今年大家又要争取更大的跃进，这又不知要出现多少英雄豪杰、先进人物。在下这本“英雄比武关键年”实在说不完，只好暂时搁住，如有机会，再续表详端。有诗为证：
        乘东风，跨火箭
        指标直上破长空
        英雄花开千万朵
        一年更比一年红
              （原载四川日报）
