Xinhua News Agency, February 19th: The commercial departments of Beijing Municipality, through the contract system, have incorporated the poultry and livestock production of suburban people's communes into the national plan, promoting the further development of livestock production in the communes. Recently, the commercial departments of various suburban districts of Beijing have signed seventy-two meat production and sales contracts with the people's communes in their respective districts, with a total value of over 23 million yuan.

According to the contracts, within this year, the people's communes will provide the commercial departments with over 400,000 pigs and sheep, as well as poultry, livestock, and aquatic products such as chickens, ducks, fish, eggs, and rabbits. The commercial departments will prepay part of the funds to help the people's communes better develop animal husbandry production. In addition, commercial and agricultural departments will also send some cadres to relevant people's communes to provide production guidance.

The contracts stipulate that the people's communes must deliver commodities to the commercial departments on time, in accordance with the varieties, quantities, and qualities stipulated in the agreement, and the commercial departments will pay for the goods at the prices stipulated by the state at that time. In the event of a poor harvest, both parties can negotiate according to the situation. After these production and sales contracts were signed, the production enthusiasm of the people's communes was very high. The party committee secretaries or commune directors personally took charge of the work and posted letters of determination and challenge, expressing their determination to do everything possible to ensure the completion of livestock production tasks. Based on the principle of public breeding as the mainstay and private breeding as a supplement, some immediately unified the arrangement of labor and formulated various plans and specific measures for feeding management and feed production. The Xiaotangshan People's Commune in Changping District initially planned to increase pig production from 70,000 heads last year to 210,000 heads, ensuring the sale of more than 25,000 commercial pigs, each weighing 150 kilograms. Many people's communes also launched competitions to develop livestock production.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 19th: The commercial departments of Tianjin Municipality have actively promoted the contract system and achieved significant results.

At present, the commercial departments of Tianjin Municipality have signed more than 1,300 production and sales contracts with people's communes in various districts and counties. According to the contract requirements, the people's communes have organized the production of more than 200 kinds of commodities since last winter, increasing their income by more than 90 million yuan. In the first half of this year, the people's communes will also deliver industrial raw materials, non-staple foods, and export goods worth more than 3.7 million yuan to the state.

In the process of signing contracts, the staff of the commercial departments conducted in-depth visits to the people's communes, conducted detailed surveys of various resources, helped the people's communes formulate various economic production plans, developed the production of most of the commodities needed by the state with development prospects, and reduced the production of some less popular commodities, thus making the commodity production plans of the people's communes more realistic. For example, eight people's communes in Tianjin, including Xinli Village, Meiman, Xianfeng, and Xiaozhan, recently received guidance from the Municipal Pharmaceutical Company when formulating their production plans, expanding the planting area of five kinds of medicinal materials that were originally not widely planted but were in high demand in the market, and also planted thirty-five kinds of new medicinal materials. The Municipal Native Produce Company also signed contracts with the people's communes to guide the people's communes to produce a large number of straw mats, straw ropes and other materials urgently needed for basic construction.

In order to better develop commodity production and ensure the implementation of the contracts, the commercial departments also organized mutual adjustments between the people's communes to make up for what they lacked, and widely utilized various substitutes; at the same time, more than 500 technicians were transferred to the production areas to provide technical guidance.

    合同制促进商品发展
    北京郊区公社按照产销合同增养家畜
    天津公社冬季以来增加收入九千万元
    新华社19日讯　北京市商业部门通过合同制度，使郊区各人民公社的家禽、家畜生产纳入国家计划，促进公社牲畜生产的进一步发展。最近北京市各郊区商业部门已同本区人民公社分别签订了七十二份肉类产销合同，价值达二千三百多万元。
    根据合同规定，在本年内，人民公社将向商业部门提供猪、羊四十多万头，还有鸡、鸭、鱼、蛋、兔等家禽、家畜和水产。商业部门要预付部分资金，帮助人民公社更好地发展畜牧业的生产。此外，商业部门和农业部门还抽出部分干部到有关人民公社进行生产指导。
    合同中规定，人民公社必须按照协议所规定的品种、数量、质量，按时向商业部门交售商品，商业部门按照当时国家规定的价格付给货款。如遇歉收，双方可以根据情况进行协商。这批产销合同签订后，各人民公社的生产情绪非常高涨。公社的党委书记或社主任亲自挂帅领导这一工作，并且纷纷贴出决心书、挑战书，表示要千方百计保证畜牧生产任务的完成。他们根据以公养为主、私养为辅的方针，有的立即统一安排劳动力，订出饲养管理、饲料生产等各项规划和具体措施。昌平区小汤山人民公社初步规划生猪生产由去年的七万头发展到二十一万头，保证出售商品猪两万五千多头，每头体重一百五十斤。许多人民公社还展开了发展畜牧业生产的竞赛。
    新华社天津19日电　天津市商业部门积极推行合同制度，收到显著效果。
    目前，天津市商业部门已与各区、县人民公社签订了一千三百多份产销合同。各人民公社根据合同要求，自去冬以来，已经组织两百多种的商品生产，增加了九千多万元的收入。在今年上半年内，各人民公社还将向国家交售价值三千七百多元的工业原料、副食品和出口物资等。
    在签订合同的过程中，商业部门工作人员深入访问人民公社，详细调查各种资源，帮助人民公社制订了多种经济生产规划，对大部分国家需要的有发展前途的商品生产加以发展，对个别不大畅销的商品的生产加以核减，这样就使人民公社的商品生产计划更加切合实际。例如天津市新立村、美满、先锋、小站等八个人民公社，最近在制订生产规划时，得到市药材公司的指导，扩大了原来种植不多而市场需要量大的五种药材的种植面积，还种植了三十五种新药材。市土产公司也通过和人民公社签订合同，指导人民公社生产了大量草帘、草绳等基本建设施工急需的物料。
    为了更好地发展商品生产，保证合同的实现，商业部门还组织各人民公社之间相互调剂有无，广泛利用各种代用品；同时抽调了五百多名技术人员，深入产区进行技术指导。
