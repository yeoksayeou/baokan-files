Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd – The broad masses of our people are watching the ongoing 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with ardent enthusiasm. Comrade Khrushchev's report on the control figures for the development of the Soviet national economy from 1959 to 1965 has become the focus of discussion among people from all walks of life in recent days. The inspiring and magnificent plan mentioned in the report has given great encouragement to the broad masses of our people.

Since the opening of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, newspapers across the country have published news of the congress in important positions. Yesterday, the People's Daily increased to twelve pages and published the full text of Khrushchev's 90,000-word report. The newspapers of that day were quickly sold out. In many places, factories, institutions, schools, radio stations, and people's communes broadcast the news of the 21st Congress on a daily basis. Many workers, commune members, students, and cadres also spontaneously held gatherings to discuss Comrade Khrushchev's report.

In the past few days, many factories, institutions, and schools in the capital held discussion meetings. People generally believe that the convocation of the 21st Congress of the CPSU is a major event in contemporary world political life. The Soviet Union's seven-year plan is a milestone in building communism, and the great achievements of the Soviet Union will greatly enhance people's confidence in the victory of the cause of communism. They have expressed their determination to muster greater efforts to accelerate our country's socialist construction. Li Hongnian, a veteran steel caster in the steelmaking workshop of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, said: The convocation of the 21st Congress of the CPSU is a great encouragement to the working people of the world. We must further learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, muster greater efforts, and achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. Zhang Ziqi, a technician at the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant, said that Comrade Khrushchev's report is increasingly exciting. The convocation of this congress marks that the Soviet people have entered a new historical period—a period of fully unfolding the construction of communism. We express our heartfelt congratulations to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people. Employees of the Beijing Railway Bureau's affiliated organs and stations in the Beijing and Fengtai areas have been eagerly reading newspapers and conducting enthusiastic discussions in recent days. Railway workers said that the Soviet Union is the strong fortress of our socialist camp, and their victory is also the victory of our socialist camp. Teachers and students of Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Renmin University of China held discussion meetings. Many people excitedly said at the meetings: We have received tremendous encouragement and strength from Comrade Khrushchev's report, and we have also seen the beautiful prospects of building a communist society. This congress has given strength to the working people of the world and is another heavy blow to imperialism.

In Tianjin, the broad masses of the people have been warmly hailing the convocation of the 21st Congress of the CPSU for days. People are excitedly discussing the grand program of the Soviet Union's great stride towards communism. Zhang Guofan, vice president of the Tianjin Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said that the 21st Congress of the CPSU is like a bright lamp hanging high in the sky, guiding the people of the world to take the happy road of socialism and communism. The scientist, who had visited the Soviet Union and witnessed the brilliant achievements of the Soviet people, said that the Soviet Union has now formulated a magnificent seven-year plan to accelerate the pace of transition to communism, which is a great encouragement to us and further strengthens our confidence and strength in building socialism. Lin Deshi, a model worker in Tianjin and a grinder at the First Machine Tool Plant, had improved his technical level with the help of Soviet experts. He was proud of the achievements of the Soviet people and said, "The seven-year plan proposed by the Soviet elder brother is an extremely great step towards the transition to communism. I believe that the Soviet people will be able to complete this great plan ahead of schedule and above quota." The grinder also said that we Chinese workers are very happy because the victory of the Soviet October Revolution is the victory of our working class all over the world, and the success of the Soviet seven-year plan will also be a major victory for our working class all over the world. We Chinese workers must take the Soviet elder brother as the best example and learn from them well. Young students at Tianjin University have been rushing to read the news about the 21st Congress of the CPSU published in the newspapers these days. A student majoring in welding in the Second Mechanical Engineering Department said that today we see the magnificent beauty of communism more clearly, which fully proves Chairman Mao's assertion that the East wind prevails over the West wind and that we are getting better day by day. A student majoring in precision instruments in the Third Mechanical Engineering Department said that the Soviet Union is always our example to learn from. Today, the rapid development of our country is also inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. We must study hard with the help of Soviet experts.

The broad masses of people in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Changchun, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region generally believe that the Soviet seven-year plan is an exciting and great plan that demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and the sharp contrast between the two forces in the world today. After reading Comrade Khrushchev's report, some people in Shanghai enthusiastically calculated the details and saw that the investment in the Soviet seven-year plan was huge, believing that the Soviet seven-year plan was indeed an unprecedentedly magnificent construction plan. Many people said that the CPSU congress was attended by delegations from the communist and workers' parties of seventy countries, indicating that the international communist movement and the socialist camp are unprecedentedly powerful and united. Sun Yingying, a cadre at an automobile manufacturing plant in Beijing, said that at the 20th Congress of the CPSU, delegations from fifty-five fraternal parties participated, and at the Moscow meeting in 1957, the number increased to sixty-four. This time, more fraternal party delegations participated in the congress, which shows that the international communist movement is becoming more and more united and stronger. Some people even compared the convocation of this congress to "another man-made satellite launched into the sky." (Attached picture)
