Xinhua News Agency, February 5th, Moscow (TASS dispatch of March 3rd): Marshal Malinovsky, Soviet Minister of Defense, delivered a speech at the 21st Congress of the CPSU on the morning of March 3rd. The full text is as follows:

    Comrades! Allow me, on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Soviet Armed Forces, to extend a warm and combative salute to you, the representatives of the historically significant 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union! (Applause)

    The officers and soldiers of our truly people's armed forces, led by the beloved Communist Party's Leninist Central Committee, are closely and inextricably linked with the entire heroic Soviet people in life and action, and their thoughts, interests, and aspirations are completely aligned with the people.

    I am honored to report to the 21st Congress that all officers and soldiers of the Soviet Army, Air Force, and Navy unanimously and fully support the control figures for the development of the national economy of the USSR for 1959-1965, and assure the beloved Party, the Soviet government, and the entire people that the heroic Soviet Armed Forces will make every necessary effort to guarantee the peace and security of our country, in order to successfully complete the program for the all-out construction of a communist society. (Stormy applause)

  **The Powerful Soviet Union Advances Shoulder to Shoulder with Other Socialist Countries**
  **The Wheel of History Turns Towards National Independence and Socialism**

    Our people, through their great labor in the years of building socialism through several five-year plans, have won the immortal honor of a pioneering people. During the period of the all-out construction of communism, our people will continuously consolidate this honor by realizing the Seven-Year Plan. The talents of the mythical left-handed craftsman are now enriched by a wealth of technical knowledge and a high degree of culture. The Soviet people have firmly established themselves in an advanced position in world science and culture.

    The Soviet Union is growing stronger and more powerful day by day. How quickly it grows, how much strength and power is in its healthy body, how wise, humane, and resourceful it is! Advancing shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Union towards socialism is a tremendous force – the great People's Republic of China, as well as the peoples of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania, and Mongolia, one-third of the German people, and half of Vietnam and half of Korea. Nearly one billion people in the world have embarked on the path of socialism, forever eliminating the capitalist system, eliminating the exploitation of man by man and the enslavement of the people. (Applause)

    A social system that makes the working people the true masters of their own destiny and makes labor a joyful need of man has become a reality for the first time in history.

    Capitalism is in decline. The peoples of all countries are unwilling to forever be threatened by unemployment, poverty, and war, and are unwilling to live under conditions of colonial exploitation. They are resolutely fighting for their own liberation.

    Black Africa has awakened, and the entire Arab world has stood up and joined the struggle for its liberation. The wheel of history is relentlessly turning in one direction, towards overthrowing colonial oppression, towards national independence and socialism.

    Perhaps it is no exaggeration to say that the socialist world, the national liberation movement of the peoples of colonial and dependent countries, and the ideas of struggle for socialism in capitalist countries now hold the majority of mankind in their hands.

    Only the blind or those who hate humanity cannot see this lawful and inevitable movement. These haters of humanity are trying every means to prevent society from developing along the socialist path. For this purpose, they are using terrible weapons of war. They want to use force to stop the progress of mankind.

    The imperialists do not deny that the peoples of all countries have made great achievements in seeking liberation and national independence. However, hatred and fear of the growth and strengthening of the socialist camp have clouded their minds, and they still adhere to the old "position of strength" stance, adopting the old policy of attempting to "prevent" the further growth of the socialist camp through so-called "forces of revenge" and the "will" to use such forces. In plain language, this means continuing to adopt a policy of preparing to use nuclear weapons to launch wars of aggression against the Soviet Union and the socialist camp countries; continuing to expand armaments and strengthen aggressive military blocs and military alliances. They are threatening us with the might of their naval and air forces.

    We can answer this by saying that these are rather outdated tools of war. Now there are newer and more powerful tools, namely, intercontinental ballistic missiles. No air defense equipment can do anything about them. They can deliver powerful hydrogen warheads to any location in the world unimpeded (they are unerring and very accurate). There is no need to doubt this, because the first such rocket has already victoriously entered the universe and is now proudly orbiting the sun with the Soviet emblem. What more evidence is needed to prove the rocket power of the Soviet state? (Stormy applause)

    Mr. Eisenhower congratulated our country on its achievements. In his message to Congress, he wrote:

  "...At the same time, we clearly recognize that some of the recent achievements of the Soviet Union in this particular technical sector are truly brilliant." We fully agree with this.

    We are happy to applaud our scientists, engineers, technicians, and all workers who have successfully created the Soviet space rocket, armed our armed forces with a series of military ballistic rockets – long-range, medium-range, and short-range intercontinental rockets and rockets within the continental range, and a series of rockets for strategic use. We express our deep gratitude to them. (Prolonged applause)

    Not long ago, British Defense Minister Sandys boasted in the British House of Commons that if a war broke out, the United States could destroy Russia. U.S. Defense Secretary McElroy and General Twining have also repeated this. U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General White said in Congress a few days ago, on January 27th of this year, that the United States' ability to destroy the Soviet military machine is the only factor deterring Russian aggression. And his deputy, General Lyman, intends to complete a broad nuclear war in two or three days. Other overly fanatical heads of American militarism proclaim that a preemptive war must be launched against the Soviet Union within the next two years, because according to their calculations, by 1961 the United States will have absolutely no hope of winning a war against the Soviet Union.

    Frankly speaking, we have heard these "plans" more than once, and we can say: Gentlemen, your hands are too short! (Prolonged applause)

    We will not talk about the opinions of American magazines, such as the deployment of "Thor" missiles in Britain, the United States' preparation to establish "Atlas" launch sites, and the plots being hatched by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Balkan Treaty, the Baghdad Pact, and other treaty organizations against our great peaceful country.

    To this, we will answer with peace of mind that if the imperialist countries still adhere to this policy in foreign affairs, and still threaten us with "force" and war, we will have to spend the necessary manpower and resources to defend the Soviet motherland. This is what the anti-Soviet aggressive policies of those major imperialist countries are forcing us to do, because the ruling circles of these countries are prepared to use armed forces to prevent the victorious advance of the peoples of all countries towards communism.

    **Imperialist Aggressive Blocs**
        **Have Never Been United**
      **Internal Contradictions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization**
        **Are Becoming Increasingly Acute**

    The aggressive bloc places great hopes on the West German Federal Defense Forces, relying on it and regarding it as the basic and most combat-effective core of the armed forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Adenauer, Strauss, and the revanchist talks of other politicians and military figures in West Germany convincingly prove that this organization is by no means a defensive organization. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was put forward "as a counterweight to communism and a magnetic center of capitalism."

    In addition, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has other missions. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is not only to be used against socialist countries, but is also a tool for implementing American policies in European capitalist countries, and a tool for establishing American rule over these countries. All this dooms this imperialist organization to internal contradictions and weakness. In history, capitalist countries that have been committed to aggression have never been united. It will be difficult for them to achieve this in the future.

    The current stage of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is characterized by the intensification of contradictions and internal struggles. The sharp accusations made by the retired Montgomery against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on October 24, 1958 are a clear manifestation of this. He said: "The entire organization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization needs to be examined and changed. It is complex, cumbersome, and its headquarters is excessively large. It takes a very, very long time to do anything because it has to go through the endless arguments of more than 100 committees of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization… The work of formulating strategic plans is extremely chaotic… The military structure needs to be changed. When making any plans, the political and military institutions must work in close cooperation and hand in hand. However, the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is in Paris, and the Military Committee is in Washington. This makes the whole job difficult..."

    Montgomery is not the only one who has criticized the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in this way. The French magazine "Perspective" pointed out when exposing the sharp internal contradictions of this aggressive organization: "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an unrealistic kingdom," "there is no command," "everyone intends to safeguard their own national interests first," "the organizational structure is terrible," it "is even inherently huge, inflexible, unreasonable, and weak," "the effective activity coefficient of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's huge headquarters is almost equal to zero," and "the strategic thinking of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is particularly limited and conservative."

    We do not regret these shortcomings of the aggressive bloc against us. The participants in this bloc see these shortcomings more clearly. Recently, French generals demanded that France be given a position in the leadership of this organization, and proposed the establishment of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization "political department" composed of the United States, Britain, and France. Montgomery and others' speeches are regarded on the one hand as a "mutiny against" American "monopoly of power" in the North Atlantic Treaty, and on the other hand as a manifestation of the dissatisfaction of some old colonialist countries with the organization's inability to guarantee their colonialist interests. West German Defense Minister Strauss, who is eager to strengthen his influence over important matters, also expressed dissatisfaction with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    All these specific circumstances prove that there are profound internal contradictions between the member states of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, which are intensifying the permanent crisis of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This is understandable. The member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are merely tools of America's selfish aggressive policy, and all the devastating consequences of war will fall on these countries first. It is becoming increasingly difficult to hide this. The people of the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are increasingly aware that the territories of these countries will become the main battlefields. More and more people are saying that only by implementing an independent policy that does not depend on the United States can they avoid war and preserve themselves, while continuing to remain in the aggressive bloc means inevitably suffering fatal blows with all the devastating consequences first.

    Healthy public opinion is increasingly strongly opposed to the policy of forcing the participants of various aggressive blocs to pull chestnuts out of the fire for American monopoly groups. We hope that this wise understanding will finally prevail and greatly reduce the danger of war.

    **The Danger of Aggressive Blocs Launching Military Adventures Still Exists**
    **The Sacred Duty of Strengthening the Soviet Union's Defense Capabilities Cannot Be Ignored**

    At the same time, I would like to point out that although the aggressive blocs, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, are full of contradictions, this will not reduce the great threat to the cause of peace and security of the peoples of all countries. Moreover, the more obvious the failure of the aggressive policy, the greater the danger that some people will launch military adventures. These people's hobby is revanchism, playing "war's edge", flaunting their might; These people (or rather, these class groups) are like a folk proverb said, "In order to warm themselves, they do not hesitate to burn the world."

    I want to issue a special warning about a very dangerous deception. Recently, Western politicians and strategists have been trying hard to prove that future wars cannot be "total wars" using strategic nuclear weapons, but that the possible form of future wars is "limited wars," "local wars," but...to use tactical nuclear weapons. This nonsense of "limited" and "local" wars is a smokescreen. In fact, the monopoly capitalists intend to do unseen business, and conspire to carry out colonial wars of aggression against weak countries, suppress national liberation movements, and conduct wars against certain socialist countries in the same way as before.

    I am afraid that never in history have the ruling groups of imperialist countries done what they are doing now. They are engaging in an arms race with unprecedented force, and directly and openly relying on huge destructive weapons to prepare for wars of aggression against the socialist camp of peace-loving countries and against nearly a billion people who hope to live according to their own will. They do not threaten anyone.

    The whole world clearly knows that the Soviet state and its allies have taken many effective measures to ease international tensions and prevent war, but these measures have been stubbornly opposed and resisted by those who initiated and pursued the "cold war" and "position of strength" policies. Under these circumstances, we would commit an irreparable mistake if we slightly neglect the sacred duty of constantly strengthening the defense power of the great socialist motherland.

  **The Soviet Union Has All the Necessary Conditions to Deal a Devastating Blow to Aggressors**
  **The Traditional Situation of the United States Being Immune from Attack Has Ended Forever**

    The Communists in the army and the entire armed forces are deeply grateful to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Comrade N.S. Khrushchev personally for exposing and smashing the despicable anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov, thereby preventing them from causing great damage to the most powerful tool of our country - the armed forces. We warmly endorse the Central Committee's firm Leninist attitude. (Applause)

    The rock-solid foundation of the Soviet Union's strong national defense lies in the Soviet Union's economic power, unbreakable political solidity, the unity of all Soviet people, and the wise and far-sighted leadership of the beloved Communist Party. The tremendous achievements of the Soviet state, which were so powerfully described in Comrade N.S. Khrushchev's report, are a prerequisite for the great increase in the power of our armed forces.

    I feel it is my duty to declare that, thanks to the constant care of the Communist Party, the Party Central Committee, and Comrade N.S. Khrushchev himself, our armed forces, in terms of their technical equipment, and in the training and education of personnel, fully meet modern military requirements. Everyone knows very well that the Soviet Union, whether in the past or now, has never wanted to invade anyone. But if anyone dares to invade us or invade our friends and allies, we have all the necessary conditions to deal a devastating blow to the aggressor, no matter where they are, and will dispel such thoughts from all people once and for all. (Applause)

    Our armed forces have very good military rocket technology and equipment, which can hit targets on the battlefield and also hit targets at any point on the earth. If someone imposes war on us, then we believe that rocket weapons are precisely the weapons that best meet the requirements of modern operations, and can effectively solve strategic, campaign and tactical tasks on land, sea and air.

    Conventional armaments have also undergone fundamental changes in the post-war period. This is essentially a completely new weapon, which is far superior to the weapons we used to win the victory in the Great Patriotic War. The quality of armaments and technical equipment has been greatly improved, and our entire air defense system has been established in a new way.

    Our air force has the most modern weapons to solve any combat task.

    Our navy has become a completely modern navy, capable of solving any strategic task it should undertake. It is often said across the ocean that the United States Navy can strike and land at any point on our coast. However, as the saying goes, "It is easy to blow, but easy to collapse". I think that some people across the ocean should also consider the fate of their own coasts and very long transportation lines, this weakness has now been prominently exposed, and the traditional situation of the United States being immune from attack has ended forever.

    Our army has become a highly technical armed force. This can be illustrated by the comparison between commanders and engineering and technical cadres. At the end of the Great Patriotic War, the ratio of engineering and technical personnel to the number of commanders in the entire armed forces was one to four point two, and even one to five point seven in the infantry, whereas now, the ratio of engineering and technical personnel to commanders in the entire armed forces is one to one point five, and one to three in the infantry. This growth index of engineering and technical cadres in our armed forces reflects the improvement in the technical equipment of the armed forces.

    The increase in the combat effectiveness of the armed forces is not limited to the increase in technical equipment. Soviet people, our excellent command cadres and outstanding privates, sailors and sergeants, have always been and will always be the decisive factor in the strength of the army, navy and air force. The past academic year has proved that the officers and soldiers of the armed forces are diligent in mastering powerful technology, developing, improving and improving their military technology.

    The resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at the October Plenary Session on "Improving Party and Political Work in the Soviet Army and Navy" has greatly helped us in solving the current tasks of the armed forces. This resolution is a comprehensive program for further developing and strengthening the armed forces in the spirit of the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Lenin's principles of leading the armed forces. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union discovered in a very timely manner that Marshal Zhukov, the former Minister of Defense, intended to separate the army from the Party, and gave this newly emerging "Napoleon" a severe blow.

    Communists, members of the Communist Youth League, and all members of the armed forces are more closely united than ever before around the beloved Communist Party and the Soviet government. They are filled with boundless love and loyalty to their great people and the socialist motherland.

    Comrades, there is no doubt that the victorious completion of the Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy will further expand and consolidate the national defense foundation of our motherland, and will make it more possible to arm the armed forces with a sufficient number of the latest weapons and technical equipment. Every member of the army, navy and air force must make all necessary efforts to keep these weapons and technical equipment in a state of full preparedness at all times, and be able to exert the maximum effectiveness. We will unite more closely around our sole leader - the great Leninist Communist Party.

    The heroic Soviet people and the people of all socialist countries can work carefree and confidently, striving to realize the historically significant plan of communist construction, and heroically move towards a happy and joyful future.

    The Soviet armed forces have been and will always be the reliable defenders of the peaceful labor of the Soviet people and their friends, and the reliable pillar of the Soviet state's peaceful policy.

    苏联国防部部长
    马利诺夫斯基在苏共二十一次代表大会上的发言
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社莫斯科3日讯：苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅3日上午在苏共第二十一次代表大会上的发言。全文如下：
    同志们！让我代表苏联武装部队全体官兵向你们，具有历史意义的苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的代表致以热烈的战斗敬礼！（掌声）
    由亲爱的共产党的列宁主义及其中央委员会所领导的我们真正的人民武装部队的官兵们，在生活和行动上同全体英勇的苏联人民有着紧密的、不可分割的联系，他们同人民的思想、利益和愿望是完全一致的。
    我荣幸地向第二十一次代表大会报告，苏联陆军、空军和海军的全体官兵都一致地、完全地拥护1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的控制数字，并且向亲爱的党、苏联政府和全体人民保证，英勇的苏联武装部队将作出一切必要的努力来保证我国的和平和安全，以便胜利完成全面展开共产主义社会建设的纲领。（暴风雨般的掌声）
  强大的苏联和其它社会主义国家并肩前进
  历史车轮向民族独立和社会主义方向转动
    我国人民在建设社会主义的几个五年计划年代里以自己伟大的劳动获得了创业人民的不朽荣誉。我国人民在全面展开共产主义建设时期将以实现七年计划来不断巩固这种荣誉。神话中左手巧的人的天赋才能，现在又被大量的技术知识和高度的文化充实了。苏联人民已在世界科学和文化中稳居先进地位。
    苏联日益壮大和越来越充满力量。它成长得多快，它的健康的身体内有多么多的力量和威力，他多么明智、人道和机智啊！同苏联一道并肩齐步地朝着社会主义迈进的还有一股巨大的力量——伟大的人民中国以及波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古等国人民、三分之一的德国人民、半个越南和半个朝鲜。世界上几乎有十亿人走上了社会主义的道路，永远消灭了资本主义制度，消灭了人剥削人和奴役人民的现象。（掌声）
    使劳动人民成为自己命运的真正主人，使劳动成为人的愉快的需要的社会制度，在历史上第一次成为现实。
    资本主义在日趋没落。各国人民不愿意永远受失业、贫困和战争的威胁，不愿意在受殖民主义掠夺的条件下生活。他们坚决为自己的解放而奋斗。
    黑非洲觉醒了，整个阿拉伯世界已挺起身来投入争取自己的解放的斗争。历史车轮无情地朝着一个方向，朝着推翻殖民主义压迫，朝着民族独立和社会主义的方向转动。
    也许，这样说并不过分：社会主义世界、殖民地和附属国人民民族解放运动、资本主义国家里为社会主义而斗争的思想，现在掌握着人类的大部分。
    只有瞎子或仇恨人类的人才看不到这种合乎规律的、不可避免的运动。这些仇恨人类的人企图用一切办法来阻止社会沿着社会主义道路发展。为了这个目的，他们采用可怕的战争武器。他们想用武力阻止人类的进步。
    帝国主义者不否认，各国人民在谋求解放和民族独立方面已经获得了巨大成就。但是，对社会主义阵营各国的壮大和增强的仇恨和恐惧迷住了他们的心窍，他们目前仍然坚持旧的“实力地位”立场，采取旧的方针，企图通过所谓“复仇力量”以及使用这种力量的“意志”来“阻止”社会主义阵营的进一步壮大。用普通话来讲，这就是继续采取这样一种方针：准备使用核武器来进攻苏联和社会主义阵营国家的侵略战争；继续进行扩充军备，加强侵略性军事集团和军事联盟。他们用自己的海空军威力来威胁我们。
    我们对这点可以这样回答：这已经是比较过时的战争工具，现在有更厉害的最新工具，这就是洲际弹道火箭。任何防空设备的确对它无可奈何，它能够通行无阻地把强大威力的氢弹头送到世界上任何一个地点（它百发百中，非常准确）。对这一点用不着怀疑，因为第一个这样的火箭已经胜利地飞入宇宙，现在它自豪地带着苏联标记围绕太阳旋转。还需要什么证据来证明苏维埃国家的火箭威力呢？（暴风雨般的掌声）
    艾森豪威尔先生祝贺我国获得成就，他在给国会的咨文中写道：
  “……同时，我们明确地承认，最近苏联在这一特别的技术部门所取得的成就中，有一些真是辉煌。”我们完全同意这一点。
    我们高兴地向我国科学家、工程师和技术员、全体工人鼓掌祝贺，这些劳动者制造成功了苏联宇宙火箭，用一系列军用弹道火箭——远程、中程和近程的洲际火箭和洲范围内的火箭，用一系列战略用的火箭武装了我们的武装部队，我们向他们表示深深的感谢。（经久不息的掌声）
    不久前，英国国防大臣桑迪斯在英国下院大吹大擂地说，一旦发生战争，美国可以消灭俄国。美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊和特文宁将军也重复过这一点。美国空军参谋长怀特将军前几天，即今年1月27日在国会中说，美国所具备的消灭苏联军事机器的能力是遏制俄国侵略的唯一因素。而他的副手利曼将军打算在两三天内就完成一场广泛的核战争。其他过分狂热的美国军国主义的头子们宣扬，必须在最近两年内对苏联发动先发制人的战争，因为据他们推算，到1961年美国要想赢得对苏联的战争就绝对没有任何希望了。
    不客气地说，我们已经不是第一次听到这些“方案”，我们可以说：先生们，你们的手太短了！（经久不息的掌声）
    我们且不谈美国杂志的言论，诸如：在英国配置“雷神”导弹，美国准备建立“阿特拉斯”发射场，以及北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织、巴尔干条约、巴格达条约和其他反对我们伟大的和平国家的条约组织正在策划的谋图等等。
    对这一点，我们将会心安理得地回答说，如果帝国主义国家仍然在外交政策上坚持这种方针，还要用“武力”、战争来威胁我们，我们将不得不付出必要的人力和物力来保卫苏维埃祖国。这是那些最主要的帝国主义国家的反苏侵略政策迫使我们这样做的，因为这些国家的统治集团准备用武装力量来阻止各国人民向共产主义的胜利进军。
    帝国主义侵略集团
        从来不会团结一致
      北大西洋公约组织
        内部矛盾日益尖锐
    侵略集团对西德联邦国防军寄以很大的希望，指望它，把它看作北大西洋公约组织武装力量的基本的和最富有战斗力的核心。阿登纳、施特劳斯和西德其他的政治家和军事家的复仇主义的谈话，令人信服地证明了，这个组织决不是一个防御性的组织。北大西洋公约组织是“作为共产主义的抗衡力和资本主义的磁力中心”而提出的。
    此外，北大西洋公约组织还具有其他的使命。北大西洋公约组织不仅要被用来反对社会主义国家，而且还是在欧洲资本主义国家执行美国政策的工具，是确立美国对这些国家的统治的工具。这一切就注定了这个帝国主义者组织的内部矛盾和软弱性。在历史上，以侵略为目的的资本主义国家还从来没有团结一致过。将来它们也很难达到这一点。
    现阶段北大西洋公约组织情况的特征是矛盾和内部斗争的尖锐化。已退职的蒙哥马利1958年10月24日对北大西洋公约组织的尖锐指责就是明显的表现。他说：“需要检查和改变北大西洋公约组织的整个组织。它复杂、累赘，它的总部过分庞大。做什么事都得花很多很多时间，因为要经过北大西洋公约组织一百多个委员会的无休止的争吵……制定战略计划的工作十分紊乱……军事结构需要加以改变。在做任何计划时，政治机构和军事机构必须在密切合作和携手的情况下工作。但是，北大西洋公约组织的理事会在巴黎，军事委员会在华盛顿。这样一来整个工作就难办了……”
    对北大西洋公约组织作这种批评的并不只是蒙哥马利一人。法国“展望”周刊在揭露这一侵略组织的尖锐的内部矛盾时指出：“北大西洋公约组织是一个不现实的王国”，“没有指挥”，“每人都首先打算维护本国的利益”，“组织机构很糟”，它“甚至天生就是庞大，不灵活，不合理和软弱的”，“北大西洋公约组织数量庞大的总部的有效活动系数差不多等于零”，而“北大西洋公约组织的战略思想是特别有限和保守的”。
    对于反对我们的侵略集团的这些缺陷，我们并不惋惜，这一集团的参加者对这些缺陷看得更清楚。最近法国将军们要求在这一组织的领导机构中给法国以地位，提出建立由美国、英国和法国组成的北大西洋公约组织“政治部”的主张。蒙哥马利等人的讲话，一方面被看成是“反对”美国在北大西洋公约中“独揽大权的哗变”，另一方面被看成是一些老牌殖民主义国家对这一组织没有能力保障它们殖民主义利益感到不满的表现。一心想加强自己对重要事务的影响的西德国防部长施特劳斯也对北大西洋公约组织表示不满。
    所有这些具体情况，都证明北大西洋侵略集团成员国之间存在着深刻的内部矛盾，使北大西洋公约组织的永久性危机愈演愈烈。这是可以理解的。北大西洋公约组织成员国不过是美国自私的侵略政策的工具，而战争的一切毁灭性后果首先将落在这些国家的身上，要掩盖这一点是越来越难了。北大西洋公约组织成员国的人民越来越清楚地看到这些国家的领土将成为主要战场。越来越多的人们都表示只有实行不依赖美国的独立政策才可以避免战争而保全自己，而继续留在侵略集团内则意味着不可避免地首先受到具有一切毁灭性后果的致命打击。
    健康的舆论越来越强烈反对迫使各种侵略集团的参加国为美国垄断集团火中取栗的政策。我们希望这种明智的认识最后获得胜利，大大减少战争的危险。
    侵略集团发动军事冒险的危险仍然存在
    加强苏联国防力量的神圣职责不能忽视
    同时我愿意指出，包括北大西洋公约组织在内的各侵略集团内部虽然矛盾重重，但是丝毫不会减少对各国人民和平与安全的事业的巨大威胁。而且，侵略政策失败得越明显，某些人发动军事冒险的危险便越大，这些人的嗜好是复仇主义，玩弄“战争边缘”，耀武扬威；这些人（更确切些说，这些阶级集团）正如一句民间谚语所说，“为了自己烤暖，不惜把世界烧完”。
    我想特别对一个非常危险的骗局提出警告。最近西方的政治家和战略家极力想证明，未来的战争不可能是使用战略性核武器的“总体战争”，未来战争的可能形式是“有限的战争”，“局部战争”，但是，……要使用战术性的核武器。这种“有限的”和“局部性的”战争的胡扯是一个烟幕，实际上是垄断资本家打算搞不可告人的勾当，阴谋照老样进行殖民战争侵略弱小国家、镇压民族解放运动，以及进行战争反对某些社会主义国家。
    恐怕在历史上从来还没有过帝国主义国家的统治集团现在所干的那样的事情，它们以空前未有的力量大搞军备竞赛，直接公开地依靠巨大的毁灭性武器来准备侵略战争反对社会主义阵营爱好和平的国家，反对将近十亿的人民，这些人民希望按照自己的意志来生活，他们并不威胁任何人。
    全世界都清楚地知道，苏维埃国家和它的盟国在缓和国际紧张局势和防止战争方面采取了许多有效的措施，而这些措施却遭到那些“冷战”和“实力地位”政策的发起者和奉行者的顽强反对和抵制。在这种情况下，如果我们稍微忽视经常加强伟大的社会主义祖国国防力量的神圣职责，我们就会犯下不可弥补的错误。
  苏联有一切必要条件给侵略者毁灭性打击
  美国传统的受不到攻击的情况已永远结束
    军队中的共产党员和整个武装部队都深深地感激苏联共产党中央委员会以及尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志本人，感激他们揭露并粉碎了马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫的卑鄙的反党集团，从而没有使他们给我们国家的最强有力的工具——武装部队带来大的损害。我们热烈赞同中央委员会的坚定的列宁主义态度。（掌声）
    苏联强大的国防力量的磐石般的基础是苏联的经济威力、牢不可破的政治坚固性、全体苏联人民的团结一致以及亲爱的共产党的英明的和有远见的领导。在尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的报告中如此有力地说明了的苏维埃国家的那些巨大成就，是我国武装部队的威力大大增长的先决条件。
    我认为我有责任声明，由于共产党、党中央委员会和尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志本人的经常关怀，我们的武装部队在自己的技术装备上，在人员的训练和教育上，都完全符合军事方面的现代要求。大家都很清楚地知道，苏联无论过去或现在，从来不想侵犯任何人。但是假若有人胆敢侵犯我们或侵犯我们的朋友和盟国，我们拥有一切必要的条件给侵略者以毁灭性的打击，不管他们是在什么地方，并将从此一劳永逸地把所有的人的这种念头打消。（掌声）
    我们的武装部队拥有非常好的军事火箭技术装备，这种装备既能够命中战场上的目标，也能够命中地球上任何一点的目标。如果有人把战争强加在我们的头上，那么我们认为，火箭武器正是最符合现代作战要求的武器，它能够有效地解决陆海空的战略、战役和战术任务。
    战后时期常规军备也发生了根本的变化。这实质上是完全新的武器，大大地优于我们用以赢得伟大卫国战争胜利的武器。军备和技术装备的质量大大地提高了，以新的方式建立了我国整个防空系统。
    我们的空军拥有解决任何战斗任务的最现代化的武器。
    我们的海军成为完全现代化的海军，它能够解决它应担负的任何战略任务。大洋彼岸常常有人说，美国海军能够在我国海岸的任何一点给予打击和进行登陆。但是，有句话说得好，“吹得容易，垮得也就容易”。我认为，大洋彼岸有的人也应当考虑一下自己海岸的命运和非常远的交通线的命运，这种弱点现在已经突出地暴露出来了，而美国传统的受不到攻击的情况已经永远结束了。
    我们的陆军已经成为具有高度技术的武装部队。这一点只要拿指挥员和工程技术干部的对比作为例子就可以说明。在伟大的卫国战争结束时，在整个武装部队中，工程技术人员的编制同指挥员编制的比例是一比四点二，而在步兵部队中甚至是一比五点七，现在，整个武装部队中的工程技术人员同指挥员的比例是一比一点五，步兵中是一比三。我们武装部队中工程技术干部的这种增长指标反映了武装部队技术装备的提高。
    武装部队战斗力的增加还不仅限于技术装备的增加。苏联人，我们优秀的指挥干部和出色的列兵、水兵和军士，过去和将来都始终是海陆空军实力的决定性因素。过去的一学年证明，武装部队的官兵在掌握强大的技术，发展、改进和提高自己的军事技术方面是勤恳的。
    苏共中央十月全会“关于改进苏联陆海军中党和政治工作”的决议对我们解决武装部队当前任务有很大的帮助，这个决议是本着苏共第二十次代表大会决议的精神和列宁的领导武装部队的原则进一步发展和加强武装部队的全面的纲领。苏共中央非常及时地发现了前国防部长朱可夫元帅有使军队脱离党的意图，并狠狠地给了这个新出现的“拿破仑”当头一棒。
    共产党员、共青团员和武装力量的全体成员空前紧密地团结在亲爱的共产党和苏联政府的周围，他们充满了对本国伟大的人民和社会主义祖国的无限热爱和忠诚。
    同志们，毫无疑问，发展国民经济七年计划的胜利完成将更加扩大和巩固我们祖国的国防基础，将更有可能用充分数量的最新式武器和技术装备武装部队。陆、空、海军的每个成员都要尽一切必要的努力使这些武器和技术装备时时刻刻处于充分准备的状态，并且能够发挥最大的效力。我们将更紧密一致地团结在我们唯一的领袖——伟大的列宁主义的共产党的周围。
    英雄的苏联人民和一切社会主义国家的人民可以无忧无虑地、满怀信心地劳动，努力去实现共产主义建设的具有历史意义的计划，英勇地走向幸福的、欢乐的未来。
    苏联武装部队过去是、将来也永远是苏联人民和他们的朋友的和平劳动的可靠的捍卫者，是苏维埃国家和平政策的可靠支柱。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）　（文内插题是本报编者加的）（附图片）
