    I want to live another seventy-three.
    Thirty-three: my parents died, I was alone,
    Working as a hired hand, doing odd jobs,
    Shedding blood and sweat.

    Thirty-three, forty-three:
    My children suffered under my knees.
    The eldest fled in search of food,
    The second died young.

    Fifty-three, sixty-three:
    My old wife kept me company, tears never dry.
    Clothes were tattered, not covering the body,
    Hungry belly, hard to walk;
    One night the north wind blew cold,
    My old wife closed her eyes.
    The past sixty years,
    Endless misery and sorrow.

    This year, I am an old man of seventy-three,
    Villagers sent me to the home for the aged,
    Happily spending my remaining years,
    Never to be lonely again;
    Communism is infinitely good,
    I want to live another seventy-three years.
  (An old man from the Home for the Aged, Weiping Commune, Fushun, Sichuan)

    我想再活七十三十三，二十三，父母死去我孤单，帮工又打短，流尽血和汗。三十三，四十三，膝下儿子难熬煎，大儿逃荒去，二儿丧黄泉。五十三，六十三，老伴相随泪不干，衣烂不遮体，肚饿行走难；一夜北风凉，老伴闭了眼，过去六十年，悲惨辛酸说不完。今年老汉七十三，乡亲送我进敬老院，欢欢喜喜度晚年，从今再不受孤单；共产主义无限好，我想再活七十三。
  （四川富顺卫平公社敬老院一老人）
