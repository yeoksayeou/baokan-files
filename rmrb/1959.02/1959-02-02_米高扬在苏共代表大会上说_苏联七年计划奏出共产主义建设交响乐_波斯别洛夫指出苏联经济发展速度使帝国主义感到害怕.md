Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 31st—The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued its session in the Grand Kremlin Palace at 4:00 PM (Moscow time) on January 31st.

    In the afternoon session, when continuing the discussion of Khrushchev's report, Pyotr Pospelov, alternate member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Committee, spoke first.

    Pospelov said that Khrushchev's report incisively analyzed the most important Marxist-Leninist theoretical issues concerning the new stage of communist construction, and mapped out inspiring prospects and concrete paths for the further development of Soviet society from socialism to communism. He pointed out that the three years after the 20th Congress of the CPSU will forever be recorded as the most glorious page in the history of communism. The anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov, who were divorced from the Party and the masses, attempted to tamper with the Leninist general line and tried to spread distrust of the major political and economic measures stipulated in the resolutions of the 20th Congress. Pospelov said that our Party repelled the anti-Party group and achieved a new and brilliant victory.

    Pospelov continued that the Seven-Year Plan is an open, direct, and bold challenge to the capitalist system, especially to the leading country of the capitalist world—the United States.
    A plan to build 15 million new homes and completely abolish taxes on residents is not one that wants to fight a war. When preparing for war, the German fascists shouted the slogan: "Guns instead of butter." But the Soviet Union wants to catch up with the United States in the production of meat, fats, and dairy products.

    Pospelov pointed out that what the imperialists fear most is the high speed of Soviet economic development, because the Soviet Union has no crises or recessions. They are disturbed by our high level of science and technology, as well as the high patriotism and morale of the Soviet people. The Seven-Year Plan—a plan for the comprehensive construction of a communist society in the Soviet Union—is the best Marxist propaganda and the best socialist propaganda.

    Pospelov pointed out that the unity of the international communist and workers' movement is growing stronger. He pointed out that the Yugoslav revisionists are traitors to Marxism. They attempted to counter the 1957 Moscow Declaration with their own program, vainly attempting to gain political capital and curry favor with their masters across the ocean. But they were fatally rebuffed by the Marxist-Leninist parties.

    Next, Onischenkov, a steelworker from the Soviet Union's largest "Red Sormovo" (Gorky) factory, spoke.

    Mikoian, a member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, said in his speech that Comrade Khrushchev's report played a magnificent symphony of communist construction. This report goes far beyond the scope of the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan. The report puts forward a series of extremely important principles that enrich Marxist-Leninist theory on the transition from socialism to communism. The 21st Congress is an organic development of the ideas of the 20th Congress. The basic theoretical principles of the 20th Congress have been fully confirmed in all aspects of life, and have stood the test of time in Party building, domestic development, and international affairs. At this Congress, we continue to adhere to the course taken by the 20th Congress.

    Mikoyan then talked about several major aspects of the Seven-Year Plan. He emphasized the tremendous and essential changes taking place in Soviet society, and particularly mentioned the great improvement in the culture of the working class and collective farmers. He said that the practical measures taken to gradually eliminate the differences between mental and physical labor, and between urban and rural areas, will be of great significance. Soviet democracy is being further developed. Every step we take towards communism reduces coercive measures.

    He said that the Seven-Year Plan shows even more so than the previous economic plans the following characteristic: it relies on the great achievements of heavy industry and its further development. It stipulates that the output of consumer goods should be increased more rapidly and the welfare of the working people should be improved. During this period, the scale of mutual assistance and economic cooperation among socialist countries will be further expanded.

    Mikoyan pointed out that in the period since the 20th Congress of the Party, the balance of power has changed in favor of peace and the socialist camp, and the overall power of the socialist countries has increased. The principle put forward at the 20th Congress that war is not inevitably inevitable has not only gained the right to exist, but has also been supported by all forces against a new war.

    When talking about the issue of opposing the anti-Party group, Mikoyan said that we are completely united. Since the anti-Party group was exposed, not a single person has joined it. We talked about the anti-Party group at this Congress with one purpose—to once again prove the complete error and harmful nature of the anti-Party group's position based on facts, and to once again emphasize that the Leninist Central Committee was completely correct in the struggle against this group. All the forces of Soviet society have never been as internally united as they are now. The unity and connection between the Party and the masses have never been achieved as they are now. The 21st Congress shows the unprecedented unity of the Party and the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, and shows the unity of the entire international communist movement.

    Mikoyan then said that during my visit to the United States, some people raised questions about the relationship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Mikoyan pointed out that raising such questions is obviously malicious. Some people wanted to know if there were any cracks in the relationship between our two countries, and this statement was based on the propaganda launched by Yugoslavia against China. Mikoyan pointed out that I told them at the time that this was just a dream. The congratulatory message from the Communist Party of China signed by Comrade Mao Zedong and the speech by Comrade Zhou Enlai at our Congress once again proved the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and China.

    Mikoyan emphasized that we will cherish this friendship like the apple of our eye. Let those who try to tarnish our friendship stop reaching out their dirty hands.

    Mikoyan talked about the friendly reception he received from ordinary Americans and business people during his visit to the United States. He said that one could feel their desire to understand how Soviet people live and what Soviet people are striving for. Americans want to understand us correctly. One could feel the American people's desire for peace. They are tired of the "Cold War" and they hope that there can be peace on Earth. Americans understand how terrible a world war would be in the presence of weapons of mass destruction such as atomic bombs and rockets. Business people understand that if they could use war to make a lot of money in the past, then now if a war breaks out, it will only lead to the destruction of American business and business people themselves.

    Mikoyan then said that in our conversations, I did not hear the "deterrence", "repulsion", and "liberation" policies that the American side constantly issued in the past. On the contrary, both the President and the Secretary of State said that they did not think that eradicating communism was their goal, right, and task, and that the United States did not want to interfere in the internal affairs of the socialist camp countries. American national leaders expressed their willingness to negotiate on some of the most important disputes. From these remarks, one should conclude that they tend to recognize the principle of peaceful coexistence of countries with different socio-political systems. If so, then these remarks should be followed by actions. Mikoyan pointed out that, however, from the recent remarks of American leaders, especially from Secretary of State Dulles' recent press conference, there is no basis to believe that they adhere to the spirit of some of the remarks they made during their conversations in the United States.

    The last part of Mikoyan's speech talked about the Soviet Union's foreign trade, including trade with the United States. He said that if the American government is also willing, we are ready to sit down and discuss the issue of barter trade for three, five, or even seven years with the United States. The Seven-Year Plan we are discussing stipulates that the volume of trade with capitalist countries should be doubled.

    Mikoyan said that when you are abroad, you particularly feel the greatness and power of the Soviet Socialist Republics Union. Our people can be proud of the Soviet government and the Communist Party's mobile, principled, consistent, and flexible policies. The Soviet government and the Communist Party have repeatedly demonstrated initiative in order to eliminate the "Cold War," ensure peace, and promote friendship among the people of all countries.

    Mikoyan said that in entering the period of comprehensively unfolding the construction of a communist society, our people are full of strength, enthusiasm, and perseverance. They have great goals and understand the path to achieving these goals, and they are advancing in the friendly family of socialist countries. The Leninist Communist Party leads them, and this is a reliable guarantee for continuous new victories.

    The famous Soviet poet Tvardovsky talked about the role and tasks of literature in social life in his speech. He said that the task of literature is to use artistic means to establish and consolidate in people's minds everything new that has entered our real life at the threshold of communism. Therefore, literature is powerfully influencing people's psychological state, their spiritual outlook, their way of thinking, and their character.

    Tvardovsky emphasized that, in this sense, combined with the plan for the victorious advance towards communism put forward by the 21st Congress, the role of literature is particularly enhanced.

    The representatives of fraternal communist parties who gave congratulatory messages at the afternoon meeting on the 31st included: Lehmann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany; Koplenig, Chairman of the Communist Party of Austria; Pollitt, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain; K. Jespersen, Chairman of the Communist Party of Denmark; Lovlien, Chairman of the Communist Party of Norway; and Kenji Miyamoto, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Japan.

    The afternoon meeting ended at 7:00 PM.

    The Congress will adjourn for one day on Sunday and will continue to meet on Monday, February 2nd.

    米高扬在苏共代表大会上说
    苏联七年计划奏出共产主义建设交响乐
    波斯别洛夫指出苏联经济发展速度使帝国主义感到害怕
    新华社莫斯科31日电　苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会1月31日下午四时（莫斯科时间）继续在大克里姆林宫举行会议。
    下午会议在继续讨论赫鲁晓夫报告时，苏共中央主席团候补委员、中央委员会书记彼奥特·波斯别洛夫首先发言。
    波斯别洛夫说，赫鲁晓夫的报告精辟地分析了有关共产主义建设新阶段的最重要的马克思列宁主义理论问题，规划了振奋人心的前景和苏联社会从社会主义到共产主义的进一步发展的具体道路。他指出，苏共第二十次代表大会后的三年将永远作为最光荣的一页载入共产主义的史册。脱离党、脱离人民群众的马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团企图篡改列宁主义总路线，企图对第二十次代表大会决议规定的重大政治经济措施散播不信任。波斯别洛夫说，我们党击退了反党集团，取得了新的光辉的胜利。
    波斯别洛夫继续说，七年计划是同资本主义体系，首先是与资本主义世界的首脑国家——美国进行和平竞赛的公开的、直接的、大胆的挑战。
  计划建筑一千五百万套新住宅和完全取消向居民征税的国家，是不愿意打仗的。德国法西斯在准备战争时叫嚷的口号是：“大炮代替牛油”。而苏联却要在肉类、油脂和奶类产量方面赶上美国。
    波斯别洛夫指出，帝国主义者最害怕的是苏联经济发展的高速度，因为苏联没有危机和衰退。他们对我们科学技术的高度水平，以至苏联人民高度的爱国主义和高昂的斗志感到不安。七年计划——苏联全面展开共产主义社会建设的计划是最好的马克思主义宣传，是最好的社会主义宣传。
    波斯别洛夫指出，国际共产主义运动和工人运动力量的团结日益加强。他指出，南斯拉夫修正主义者是马克思主义的叛徒，他们企图以自己的纲领同1957年11月莫斯科会议宣言相对抗，妄图以此来捞取政治资本和讨好大洋彼岸的主子。但是他们遭到了马克思列宁主义政党的致命性回击。
    接着，苏联最大的“红色索尔莫沃”（高尔基）工厂的炼钢工人奥尼申科夫发了言。
    苏共中央主席团委员米高扬发言时说，赫鲁晓夫同志的报告奏出了宏伟的共产主义建设交响乐。这个报告远远超出了七年计划任务的范围。报告中提出了一系列极为重要的原理，这些原理丰富了马克思列宁主义关于从社会主义过渡到共产主义的理论。第二十一次代表大会是第二十次代表大会思想的有机发展，第二十次代表大会的基本理论原理已经在生活的各个方面得到了充分的证实，无论在党的建设、国内发展以及国际方面都经住了时间的考验。在这次代表大会上，我们继续奉行第二十次代表大会所采取的方针。
    米高扬接着谈到了七年计划的几个主要方面。他强调指出了苏维埃社会中正在发生的巨大的本质上的变化，并且特别提到工人阶级和集体农民文化的巨大提高。他说，为逐步消除脑力劳动和体力劳动、城市和乡村之间的差别而采取的实际措施将具有重大意义。苏维埃民主正得到进一步的发展。我们向共产主义迈进的每一步都在减少强制手段。
    他说，七年计划比前几个经济计划还在更加大得多的程度上表明了这样一个特点：它依靠重工业的巨大成就，依靠重工业的进一步发展，它规定，要更快地增加消费品产量，增进劳动人民的福利。在这个时期，社会主义国家互助和经济合作的规模将进一步扩大。
    米高扬指出，在党的第二十次代表大会以后的时期中，力量对比发生了有利于和平和社会主义阵营的变化，社会主义国家的总的威力增长了。第二十次代表大会提出的目前战争不是注定不可避免的这一原理，不仅取得了生存权，而且得到了所有反对新战争力量的拥护。
    米高扬在谈到反对反党集团的问题时说，我们是完全团结一致的。自从反党集团被揭露以来，这个集团一个人也没有增加。我们在这次代表大会上谈到反党集团是抱着一个目的——再一次地根据事实来证明反党集团立场的完全错误和有害的性质，并且再一次地强调列宁主义的中央委员会在反对这一集团斗争中是完全正确的。苏维埃社会的一切力量任何时候都不曾有过像现在这样的内部团结，党同群众的团结一致和联系，也是任何时候都不曾做到现在这样。第二十一次代表大会显示着党和苏联各族人民的空前团结，显示着整个国际共产主义运动的团结。
    米高扬接着说，在我访问美国期间，有人向我提出了有关苏联和中华人民共和国之间的关系问题。米高扬指出，提出这种问题显然是不怀好意。有人希望知道，我们两国的相互关系上是否有什么裂痕，而这种说法是在南斯拉夫发动的反对中国的宣传的基础上产生的。米高扬指出，我当时对他们说，这只不过是在作梦。由毛泽东同志签署的中国共产党的贺词和周恩来同志在我们代表大会上的发言再一次地证明了苏中两国的牢不可破的友谊。
    米高扬强调说，我们将像爱护眼珠一样爱护这种友谊。让那些妄图沾污我们友谊的人不要再伸出他们的脏手吧。
    米高扬谈到他访美期间普通美国人和实业界人士对他的友善的接待。他说，可以感到他们渴望了解苏联人是如何生活的，苏联人在努力争取的是那些事情。美国人想正确地了解我们。可以感到美国人民对和平的渴望。他们对“冷战”已经感到厌烦，他们希望地球上能有和平。美国人懂得，在现在有着原子弹和火箭这样一些杀人武器的情况下，世界大战是多么可怕的东西。实业界人士懂得，如果以前可以利用战争来大做其生意的话，那末现在如果爆发战争就只会使美国的生意和做生意的人自己遭到毁灭。
    米高扬接着说，在我们的谈话中，我没有听到美国方面从前不断发出的那些“威慑”、“击退”、
  “解放”政策的言论。而是相反，无论总统或是国务卿都说，他们并不认为革除共产主义是他们的目的、权利和任务，都说美国不想干涉社会主义阵营国家的内政。美国国家领导人表示愿意就一些最重要的争端进行谈判。从这些言论中理应得出结论：他们倾向于承认社会政治制度不同的国家和平共处的原则。如果是这样，就应当继言论之后用行动来证实这些言论。米高扬指出，可是，从美国领导人最近的言论，特别是从国务卿杜勒斯最近在记者招待会上的谈话中却找不到根据可以认为，他们恪守在美国交谈时他们发表过的一些言论的精神。
    米高扬发言的最后一部分谈到了苏联对外贸易问题，其中包括美国的贸易问题。他说，如果美国政府也愿意的话，我们准备坐下来同美国商谈三年、五年、甚至七年的换货问题。我们正在讨论的七年计划规定把同资本主义国家的贸易额增加一倍。
    米高扬说，当你在国外时，就特别感到苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的伟大和威力。我国人民可以对苏联政府和共产党的机动、有原则、一贯和灵活的政策感到自豪，苏联政府和共产党为了消除“冷战”、确保和平和各国人民之间的友谊一再表现了主动的精神。
    米高扬说，在进入全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期，我国人民充满着力量、热情和毅力，他们有伟大的目标并且了解到达这一目标的道路，在社会主义国家的友爱大家庭中前进。有列宁主义的共产党领导着他们，而这就是不断取得新胜利的可靠保证。
    苏联著名诗人特瓦尔多夫斯基在发言中谈到了文学在社会生活中的作用和任务。他说，文学的任务是要用艺术表现手段在人们的意识中确立并巩固在共产主义的门前列入我们现实生活中的一切新东西。因此，文学正强有力地影响着人们的心理状态，影响着人们的精神面貌、思维方式和性格。
    特瓦尔多夫斯基着重指出，从这个意义上来讲，结合第二十一次代表大会所提出的向共产主义胜利前进的规划看来，文学的作用特别提高了。
    在31日下午会议上致贺词的兄弟共产党代表有：德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼、奥地利共产党主席柯普勒尼希、英国共产党执行委员会主席波立特、丹麦共产党主席克·耶斯佩森、挪威共产党主席洛夫林、日本共产党中央委员会总书记宫本显治。
    下午会议在七时结束。
    代表大会将在星期日休会一天，在星期一——2月2日继续开会。
