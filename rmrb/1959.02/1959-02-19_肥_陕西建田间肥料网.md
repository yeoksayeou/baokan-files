    Shaanxi Establishes Field Fertilizer Network
    (From Our Correspondent) Shaanxi is universally establishing field fertilizer networks, combining the current fertilizer accumulation campaign to establish a base for regular fertilizer accumulation, production, preservation, and application.
    This field fertilizer network includes field-side smoking fertilizer pits (or cellars), field composting pits, field manure accumulation pits, field liquid fertilizer tanks, and field cattle, sheep, and pig pens established on a certain area of cultivated land. The Yan'an Special District has dug nearly a million field-side smoking fertilizer pits, and thirty-four cattle and sheep pens have been moved to the mountains. Jingbian County has dug more than 75,000 composting pits. In the Guanzhong Plain area, almost every mu of high-yield land has a field-side liquid fertilizer tank, and there is a composting pit or manure accumulation pit for every few mu of land.
    Shaanxi has emphasized on-site fertilizer accumulation, production, and application in every fertilizer accumulation campaign. The Yan'an Special District alone composted 7.5 billion jin of fertilizer in the fields last year, and moved 2,000 sheep flocks to the mountains. After the first production team of the Hongqi Commune in Longxian County moved six livestock pens and two pig pens to the mountains, fifty mu of land that could not be fertilized in previous years due to transportation difficulties were all fertilized. In order to strive for a greater harvest this year, various places will increase the application of a large amount of fertilizer and will carry out regular phased fertilization, so the amount of fertilizer transportation will be greater. Based on this situation, various places have timely summarized the local experience in field fertilizer accumulation, and according to the needs of local fertilizer sources and crops, they have put forward the planning for field fertilizer networks, and held on-site meetings to vigorously promote the experience of field fertilizer networks. In response to the difficulties in fertilizer transportation in low mountains and the inability to utilize a large amount of fertilizer sources in distant mountain areas in the past, Pingli County summarized and promoted the experience of Dongfanghong and other three communes in vigorously developing field-side smoking fertilizer and composting fertilizer to ensure comprehensive grain production increases. Now, the county has dug 78,400 Imperata cylindrica pool composting pits, averaging one for every one and a half mu of land, together with a large number of field-side smoking fertilizer pits, accumulating and producing more than 8 billion jin of fertilizer, preparing more than 70,000 jin of fertilizer for each mu of deep-plowed land in the county, an increase of more than 20 times compared with last year's fertilizer application.
    The establishment of the field fertilizer network can not only make full use of fertilizer resources, but also accelerate the speed of fertilizer accumulation and production, improve fertilizer quality, and facilitate timely fertilization. After the establishment of the field fertilizer network in the mountainous areas of northern and southern Shaanxi, weeds and other materials on the mountains can be utilized. Land that could not be fertilized or received very little fertilizer in the past now has a large amount of fertilizer. After the Qifeng Production Team of the Tongguan Commune dug field composting pits, the amount of composting in the last five days increased by more than double compared with the first ten days because the amount of transportation was greatly reduced, and more than 60% of the labor force was saved. The sixth production team of the Shicao Commune in Dali County set up a fertilizer network composed of more than 60 manure tanks around the wells in high-yield fields. Because the tanks are covered for insulation, they are easy to ferment and can be top-dressed with irrigation at any time, so the fertilizer efficiency is very high.

### 肥  陕西建田间肥料网

    陕西建田间肥料网
    本报讯　陕西各地正在普遍建立田间肥料网，结合当前积肥突击运动，为今后经常性的积肥、造肥、保肥、施肥建立基地。
    这种田间肥料网包括有建立在一定耕地面积上的地头熏肥坑（或窖）、田间沤肥坑、田间积肥坑、田间水肥缸和田间牛、羊、猪圈等。延安专区挖了近百万个田头熏肥坑，有三十四群牛、羊圈已经搬到山上。靖边县挖下的沤肥坑有七万五千多个。在关中平川各地，几乎每亩高产田都有一个田头水肥坑，几亩地就有一个沤肥坑、积肥坑。
    陕西各地在历次突击积肥中都强调就地积肥、制肥、施肥。单是延安专区去年就在地头沤肥达七十五亿斤，把二千群羊都搬到山上。陇县红旗一社第一生产队把六个牲畜圈和两个猪圈搬到山上后，使历年因运肥困难而不能施肥的五十亩地都上了粪。各地为了争取今年更大的丰收，都要增施大量的肥料，而且要进行经常的分期施肥，所以肥料的运输量更大。根据这种情况，各地及时总结了当地田间积肥的经验，根据各地肥源和农作物的需要，提出了田间肥料网的规划，并且召开现场会议，大力推广田间肥料网的经验。平利县针对过去在低山积肥运输困难、远山地大量的肥源不能利用的情况，总结、推广了东方红等三个公社大搞地头熏肥、沤肥，保证粮食全面增产的经验。现在全县已挖好七万八千四百个水茅池沤肥坑，平均一亩半地就有一个，连同大量的田头熏肥坑，已积肥制肥八十多亿斤，为全县每亩深翻地备下七万多斤肥料，比去年的施肥量增加二十多倍。
    田间肥料网的建立，不仅可以充分利用肥源，而且加快了积肥、制肥的速度，提高了肥料质量，又便于按期施肥。陕北、陕南山区建立了田间肥料网以后，山上的杂草等都能加以利用，过去无法施肥或施肥很少的土地，现在也都有了大量的肥料。潼关公社七峰生产队挖下田间沤肥坑以后，因运输量大大减少，后五天比前十天沤肥量增加一倍多，还节省下60％以上的劳动力。大荔石槽公社第六生产队在高产田水井周围设置了六十多个粪缸组成的肥料网，因为加盖保温，容易发酵，又随时可以同灌溉一块追肥，因此肥效很高。
