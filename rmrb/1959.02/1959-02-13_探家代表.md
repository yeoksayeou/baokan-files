Home Visit Representative
　　
　　As soon as I got on the train, I heard the sound of arguing. I turned my head to look and saw a young man dressed as a worker arguing with an old man in his fifties. The young man had bright eyes, a tall stature, and gestured with his hands every time he spoke, appearing very anxious. Facing him was a stubborn old man. I heard the young man say to him, "Dad, you... you're really not open to advice!" Oh, so they were father and son. The old man also said, "Who isn't open to advice? Your dad isn't open to advice?" "Dad, I've been telling you for a long time, but you won't accept my opinion, you are... really stubborn." This sentence angered the old man, who said, "You little rascal, you're scolding your father now! Do you know that the factory is rushing to build generators? If everyone goes home, who will build the generators? Huh?" "Didn't the factory director approve your going home for the New Year? Master Liu and the others are leading the work on building the machines." "Go home for the New Year, New Year... it's not like I haven't celebrated the New Year before. Zhuzi, when you get home, tell your mother that the factory can't do without me. I'll go home to see her when I have time after the New Year." The old man said this and was about to leave, but the young man grabbed him and said anxiously, "Dad, I think you should go back if you can. Mom will get angry." "Your mom won't get angry. Besides, you're representing me!" The young man grumbled discontentedly. The father finally patted his son on the shoulder and lectured him in a measured tone, "This is you being elected as the home visit representative by the three of us, not my decision. Alright, I should go." Saying this, the old man got off the train, and the young man ran to the train window and shouted, "Dad, what if Mom gets angry?" The old man didn't answer outside, but just shook his fist and made a threatening gesture. The young man sat down helplessly. Then the train slowly started moving.

　　The people on our train had long been attracted by this father and son's interesting conversation and gathered in a large circle. After the young man sat down, I asked curiously, "Comrade, was that old man your father?" The young man said a little aggrievedly, "He is my father, a commandist..." This term caused another burst of laughter from everyone. Someone asked him where he worked, and he said, both aggrieved and proud, "My dad, my brother, and I all work at the Shenyang Electric Motor Factory. My dad is a veteran technician in the factory, my brother is the deputy director, and I'm the last to learn the craft, just an apprentice. Our hometown is in Dezhou. Every New Year and holiday, the higher-ups always approve the three of us to go home to visit relatives, but my brother is the first not to go home. He always finds a bunch of reasons, like the factory can't do without him, the plan isn't finished, there are meetings to attend, inspections to do, he's the deputy director after all. My dad? He also has reasons, like the machines need to be repaired, he doesn't feel comfortable just letting the apprentices do it. As a result, only I can go home." The young man paused and said, "Before the Spring Festival this year, Director Xu said to my dad, 'The three of you have never gone back together for a holiday. Go back together this year and make your wife happy.' But just then, the factory received a new task, to rush to build three hundred generators around the Spring Festival. When my dad heard this news, he said to my brother, 'Deputy Director, I'm getting old and have lived with your mother for more than forty years. It doesn't matter if I don't see her this time. I'll stay in the factory to produce, and you and Zhuzi go home to take a look.' Needless to say, my brother had even more excuses, he said, I think we should still let Zhuzi go home alone as the 'home visit representative' this year!"

　　Saying this, he spread his hands towards us, and we all understood what he meant without him having to say it.

    探家代表
    姚志成
    我一上火车，就听到有争吵的声音，转过头去一看，只见一位工人打扮的青年正和一位五十多岁的老人争辩着什么。青年有一对明亮的大眼睛，高高的个子，每说一句话就打一个手势，显得很着急的样子。在他面前的是一位倔强的老头。只听见青年人对他说：“爸，你……真不虚心！”噢，原来是父子俩呢。老人也说：“谁不虚心？你爸不虚心？”“爸，我跟您说了半天了，您都不接受意见，您可……真固执”，这句话可激怒了老人，老头说：“你这个猴崽子，骂起你爹来了，你知不知道厂里要赶造发电机？都回家，那发电机谁造？嗯？”“不是厂长批准你回家过年的吗？造机器有刘师傅他们领着干了。”“回家过年，过年……好像我没过过年似的，柱子，你到家和你妈说，厂子里离不开我，等过了年有空我再回家看她。”老头说罢就要走，青年人一把拉住他，急切地说：“爸，我看您还是能回去就回去吧，妈要生气的。”“你妈不会生气的，再说，你代表我嘛！”青年人还不满的咕噜着。父亲最后拍着儿子的肩膀一板一眼的数落着：“这是咱爷三个公选的你当探家代表?，又不是我决定的，好了，我该走了。”说着老头下了车，这位青年人又跑到车窗前叫了一声：“爸，要是我妈生气呢？”老人在外面没有回答，只是摇了摇拳头，作了一个吓唬人的动作。青年人无可奈何地坐下来。跟着火车也徐徐开动了。
    我们车上的人早被这父子有意思的对话吸引住了，围了一大圈人，等青年人坐定之后，我好奇的问道：“同志，刚才那位老人是您父亲？”青年有点委屈地说：“是父亲，命令主义……”这个名词又引起了大家一阵哄笑。有人问他在哪里工作，他又委屈又骄傲地说开了。“俺爸俺哥和我都在沈阳电机厂作工，俺爸是工厂的老技师，俺哥是副厂长，就数我学手艺晚，是个徒工。俺老家在德州，每逢过年过节上级总批准俺爷三个回家探亲，可是我哥第一个不回家，他总找一大堆理由，什么厂里离不开呀，计划没完成呀，要开会，要检查，人家是副厂长嘛；我爸呢？也有理由，什么机器要修理呀，光叫徒工干不放心呀，结果就只有我一个人能回家了。”青年人停了停又说：“今年春节前，徐厂长对俺爸说，‘你们爷三个从没一块回去过过节，今年一起回去吧，叫你老伴高高兴’。可正好厂里接了新任务，春节前后要赶造出三百部发电机，俺爸听到这消息就对俺哥说：‘副厂长，我年纪大了，和你妈在一块生活了四十多年，这回不见面也没什么，我留在厂里生产，你和柱子回去看看家吧’，甭说，俺哥就更有词儿了，他说，我看今年还是叫柱弟一个人回家作‘探家代表’吧！”
    说着，他朝我们把双手一摊，下面的话，不说我们也都明白了。
