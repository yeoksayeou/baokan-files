Xinhua News Agency, Taiz, February 25th: According to a broadcast from Sana'a Radio, the King of Yemen, Imam Ahmad, made a statement to Sana'a Radio reporters on February 24th, the first anniversary of the joint establishment of the United Arab Republic by Yemen and the United Arab Republic.

    Imam Ahmad condemned the imperialists' conspiracy to create discord and division among the Arabs. Imam Ahmad said that the imperialists cloaked their conspiracy in a false guise by declaring the establishment of a so-called "Federation" in the southern part of Yemen they occupy. The imperialists believe that this new conspiracy will cover up their crimes and threaten the United Arab Republic. But they have forgotten that the Arab people's awareness has been raised, and the Arabs know that the purpose of this "Federation" is to divide the Arabs, steal their land and wealth, mock their fate, and put foreign chains around their necks and on the United Arab Republic.

    Imam Ahmad concluded by saying that the unification of Yemen will inevitably be realized, and the day will come when the people will crush the false "Federation" and share the joy of their compatriots throughout the Arab world.

    也门国王向记者发表谈话
    斥帝国主义分裂阿拉伯人
    新华社塔兹25日电　据萨那电台广播，也门国王伊马姆·艾哈迈德24日在也门和阿拉伯联合共和国联合成立阿拉伯联合邦一周年之际对萨那电台记者发表了谈话。
    伊马姆·艾哈迈德谴责了帝国主义者阴谋在阿拉伯人中间制造分歧和分裂。伊马姆·艾哈迈德说，帝国主义者给他们的阴谋披上了虚假的外衣，在他们占领的也门南部宣布成立所谓的“联合邦”。帝国主义者认为，这个新的阴谋将会掩盖他们的罪行，威胁阿拉伯联合邦。但是他们忘记了，阿拉伯人民的觉悟已经提高了，阿拉伯人知道这种“联合邦”的目的是要分裂阿拉伯人，窃取他们的土地和财富，嘲弄他们的命运，在他们的脖子上和阿拉伯联合邦身上套上外国的锁链。
    伊马姆·艾哈迈德最后说，也门的统一必然实现，人民粉碎假“联合邦”和分享整个阿拉伯世界同胞的欢欣的日子必将会来到。
