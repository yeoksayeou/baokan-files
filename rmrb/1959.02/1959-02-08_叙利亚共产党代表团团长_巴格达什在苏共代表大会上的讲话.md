Xinhua News Agency, February 6th: According to the Soviet "Pravda," Khalid Bakdash, head of the Syrian Communist Party delegation attending the 21st Congress of the CPSU, delivered a speech at the morning session on February 2nd, the full text of which is as follows:

Dear Comrades! On behalf of the Central Committee of the Syrian Communist Party, on behalf of the workers, peasants, trade union activists, on behalf of all progressive elements – writers, poets, engineers, lawyers, professors, teachers and university students, on behalf of all Syrian patriots loyal to the cause of independence, loyal to the cause of the liberation of the Arab people, loyal to the cause of peace and democracy, I extend to your great congress and, through it, to the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the heroic Soviet people, the fraternal greetings full of affection, respect and gratitude. (Applause)

Comrades! The great achievements mentioned by Comrade Khrushchev in his report, as well as the great achievements to be made in industry, agriculture, science, technology, and improving the welfare and culture of the people according to the Seven-Year Plan, like all the great victories achieved by the heroic Soviet people under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union, will be the victory of all progressive mankind and the victory of the great cause of peace. These achievements make the Syrian people and the entire Arab East rejoice, and they are proud of the victory of their close and loyal friend. (Applause)

The part of Comrade Khrushchev's report that deals with the Arab East is a very precious and historic help to the Arab national liberation movement. The Soviet Union has always been faithful to the Leninist foreign policy based on non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. It is our loyal friend. Through Comrade Khrushchev, it tells the Arab people to beware of the danger of separation in the national forces front in various Arab countries, and to beware of the rupture of the unity of the Arab peoples and the rupture of the united front of the Arab countries, because the battle with imperialism is not yet over, because the colonialists, although they have changed their tactics, have not changed their goals. They are constantly looking for cracks in the Arab national liberation movement, and often artificially creating cracks, in order to attack this movement, then restore their lost imperialist rule and re-chain the Arab people who have won freedom, independence, and national sovereignty through struggle and national unity.

Comrade Khrushchev's words will be heartily welcomed by every patriotic Arab in the United Arab Republic and other Arab countries, because these are the words of a sincere friend who is good at foresight, because these words depict the most real picture of the current Arab reality. (Applause)

The imperialist groups applaud the movement carried out under the slogan of "anti-communism." As for the anti-imperialist masses and the broadest patriots in the entire Arab world, regardless of their beliefs, they are deeply disturbed by the consequences of this opposition to the entire Arab liberation movement. The leaders of the Arab Socialist Renaissance Party are particularly active in this movement. These are adventurers who are very similar to the right-wing socialists in Europe. They learn from the Yugoslav revisionist traitors and play a very dirty role in the Arab East. This is a group of adventurers, spies, and saboteurs who have turned their backs on the people and are undermining the Arab liberation movement. These adventurers – the leaders of the Arab Socialist Renaissance Party – have gone bankrupt in front of the people. They attempt to use the slogan of "anti-communism" to make the liberated Arab countries abandon the policy of active neutrality, stifle democratic freedoms, and open the door to the imperialist capital of West Germany, Italy, and Japan, or to international banks ruled by American capital. Like the Yugoslav revisionists, they insist that there is Western imperialism and "Eastern imperialism," while keeping silent about the rule of the imperialists in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. They concentrate their fire of hatred against the young and heroic Republic of Iraq, and create conspiracies everywhere to eliminate it. The establishment of this republic is a great victory achieved by the Middle East liberation movement. (Applause) These adventurers insist that Arab unity is not unity, and it will never succeed. They say that this unity has no future.

The Syrian people have known us Syrian communists for more than thirty years. It is not so easy to force them to believe that we are enemies of the Arab national movement and opponents of Arab unity. Likewise, it is difficult to make them believe that communism and Zionism are the same thing. The Syrian people are deeply convinced by personal experience that not only Arab communists, but all communists, are the strongest fighters against imperialism and Zionism. All Arabs know that without the support of the socialist camp led by the Communist Party, the Arab struggle would not be victorious, they would not be able to repel the imperialist aggressors and defeat their conspiracies, and the Arab countries would not be able to develop their own national economies.

We Syrian communists, like all progressive and patriotic Arabs with various viewpoints, regard Arab unity first of all as a movement to get rid of imperialist oppression, a movement that is based on and relies on the masses of the people. The foundation of Arab unity should be to get rid of imperialist oppression and carry out a tenacious struggle against imperialism – this is the first; second, the objective conditions formed in each Arab country should be taken into account; and finally, third, Arab unity should be built on a truly democratic basis.

Based on these principles and studying the experience of the merger between Egypt and Syria, the Central Committee of the Syrian Communist Party formulated a program containing thirteen articles. This program takes into account the objective conditions in each of these two regions in terms of management and regime issues. The program states: establish governments and parliaments in each of these two regions, and at the same time establish a central government and central parliament to handle defense and foreign policy issues and other issues of the united country. All these organs should be established through free elections by the people. The program stipulates democratic freedoms for the people and establishes an economic link between the Egyptian and Syrian regions that guarantees the economic, especially industrial, development of each region. The program also stipulates the implementation of the construction projects and economic development plans agreed upon by Syria and the Soviet Union before the merger. The program talks about guaranteeing the achievements of the Syrian working class, its wages and trade union freedom. The program stipulates the implementation of land reform to ensure that landless farmers can obtain land and the material conditions for operating on this land. The program mentions the need to combat the phenomenon of imperialist capital infiltrating our country, to be vigilant against the tricks of American imperialism, and to establish lasting friendly relations with the fraternal Republic of Iraq and consolidate friendly ties with the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp. (Applause)

This program has received widespread support from the Syrian people – all patriots from all walks of life. It is like a national charter, because it truly proposes the only feasible and correct way to solve the economic, political and social problems that have arisen, and provides the possibility of getting rid of the serious difficulties currently encountered in Syria. This program points out the way to consolidate the United Arab Republic and supports the idea of implementing Arab unity throughout the Arab world.

We have stated that we are ready to discuss these issues with everyone. But the response was to ban democratic newspapers, ban all democratic publications, and arrest hundreds of communists and progressive patriots.

But it is impossible to isolate our party, because the vast majority of the people, economic and commercial circles support our views. In any case, we are deeply convinced that victory must belong to the decisions that meet the objective development needs of Arab society. Our party's policy reflects these needs, and it is full of firm confidence in the future.

Thank you to all the communist comrades in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas for their sympathy for our national, democratic and just struggle. Comrades, I assure you that the banner of Marxism-Leninism raised by our party will never fall in Arab Syria. (Applause) This banner will always fly high, because our people are convinced by personal experience that this banner is the banner of true patriotism, the banner of democracy and socialism, the banner of respect for people, and the banner of unwavering and self-sacrificing for the protection of the interests of the people.

Long live the great Soviet Union, the vanguard of mankind's struggle for peace and progress, for the equality and fraternal unity of all nations! (Stormy applause)

Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the big brother and advanced force of all communists in the world! (Stormy and lasting applause)

Long live the heroic struggle of the Soviet people for the construction of communism! (Stormy applause)

Long live the friendship between the Arabs and the Soviets! (Stormy and prolonged applause. All stand)

    叙利亚共产党代表团团长
    巴格达什在苏共代表大会上的讲话
    新华社6日讯　据苏联“真理报”报道：出席苏共第二十一次代表大会的叙利亚共产党代表团团长哈勒德·巴格达什同志在2日上午会议上致词，全文如下：
    亲爱的同志们！我代表叙利亚共产党中央委员会，代表工人、农民、工会活动家，代表一切进步分子——作家、诗人、工程师、律师、教授、教师和大学生，代表忠于独立事业，忠于阿拉伯人民解放事业，忠于和平和民主事业的一切叙利亚爱国者，向你们伟大的代表大会并通过它向光荣的苏联共产党和英雄的苏联人民致以充满爱戴、尊敬和感激的友情的兄弟的敬礼。（鼓掌）
    同志们！赫鲁晓夫同志在他的报告中所谈的那些伟大的成就，以及根据七年计划在工业、农业、科学、技术和提高人民的福利，文化方面将取得的伟大成就，同英雄的苏联人民在光荣的苏联共产党的领导下所取得的一切伟大胜利一样，将是整个进步人类的胜利，伟大和平事业的胜利。这些成就使叙利亚人民以及整个阿拉伯东方欢欣鼓舞，他们为自己亲密而忠实的朋友的胜利而骄傲。（鼓掌）
    赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中谈到阿拉伯东方问题的那一部分，是对阿拉伯民族解放运动的非常珍贵的历史性的帮助。苏联始终忠于以不干涉别国内政为基础的列宁主义外交政策，它是我们的忠实朋友，它通过赫鲁晓夫同志告诉阿拉伯人民，让他们提防各阿拉伯国家内民族力量阵线发生分离的危险，提防阿拉伯各国人民团结发生破裂、各阿拉伯国家团结战线发生破裂的危险，因为同帝国主义的战斗还没有结束，因为殖民主义者虽然改变了策略，但是并没有改变自己的目的。他们时刻在阿拉伯民族解放运动中寻找裂缝，经常人为地制造裂缝，以便打击这个运动，然后恢复自己已经失去的帝国主义统治并给由于进行斗争和民族团结而夺得了自由、独立和民族主权的阿拉伯人民重新带上锁链。
    赫鲁晓夫同志的话会受到阿拉伯联合共和国及其他阿拉伯国家的每一个爱国的阿拉伯人的衷心欢迎，因为这是善于高瞻远瞩的真挚朋友的话，因为这些话描绘出了现在阿拉伯现实的最真实的图景。（鼓掌）
    帝国主义集团对于在“反共”的口号下进行的运动拍手称快。至于整个阿拉伯世界的反对帝国主义的人民群众和最广泛的爱国人士，不管他们的信仰如何，都对这种反对整个阿拉伯解放运动的后果深感不安。阿拉伯复兴社会党的首领尤其积极地参加这一运动，这是些冒险家，他们很像欧洲的右翼社会党人，他们向南斯拉夫修正主义叛徒们学习，在阿拉伯东方起着一种非常肮脏的作用，这是一群背离人民的、摧残阿拉伯解放运动的冒险家、奸细和破坏者的匪帮。这些冒险家——阿拉伯复兴社会党的首领，在人民面前遭到了破产，他们企图利用“反共”的口号使已经解放了的各个阿拉伯国家放弃积极中立的政策，窒息民主自由，为西德、意大利和日本的帝国主义资本或由美国资本统治的国际银行大开方便之门。像南斯拉夫修正主义者一样，他们硬说有西方帝国主义和“东方帝国主义”，而对于帝国主义者在约旦和沙特阿拉伯的统治闭口不提。他们集中自己充满了仇恨的火力反对年青的英勇的伊拉克共和国，到处制造阴谋以便消灭它，而这个共和国的建立是中东解放运动所取得的极伟大的胜利。（鼓掌）这些冒险家硬说，阿拉伯的团结并不是团结，它任何时候也不会得逞，他们说什么这种团结是没有未来的。
    叙利亚人民知道我们叙利亚共产党人已经三十多年了。要想迫使他们相信我们是阿拉伯民族运动的敌人、是阿拉伯团结的反对者，并不是那么容易的事情。同样，也很难使他们相信共产主义和犹太复国主义是一回事。叙利亚人民根据亲身经验深信，不仅是阿拉伯的共产党人，一切共产党人都是反对帝国主义和犹太复国主义的最坚强的战士。所有阿拉伯人都知道，如果没有共产党领导的社会主义阵营的支持，阿拉伯人的斗争就不会取得胜利，他们就不能击退帝国主义者的侵略和击破他们的阴谋，而各阿拉伯国家就不能发展自己的民族经济。
    我们叙利亚共产党人，和持有各种不同观点的一切进步的爱国的阿拉伯人一样，把阿拉伯的团结首先看作是争取摆脱帝国主义压迫的运动，这个运动是以人民群众为基础并依靠人民群众的。阿拉伯团结的基础应当是摆脱帝国主义的压迫，对帝国主义进行顽强的斗争——这是第一；第二，应当考虑到每一个阿拉伯国家中所形成的客观条件；最后，第三，阿拉伯的团结应当建立在真正民主的基础上。
    根据这些原则出发，并研究了埃及和叙利亚合并的经验，叙利亚共产党中央委员会制定了包含十三个条款的纲领。这个纲领估计到了这两个地区中的每一个地区在管理和政权问题上的客观条件。纲领中说：在这两个地区的每一个地区中建立政府和国会，同时建立处理国防和对外政策问题以及联合国家的其他问题的中央政府和中央国会。所有这些机关都应当用人民自由选举的方法来建立。纲领规定给人民以民主自由，确立埃及地区和叙利亚地区之间的一种能保证每一个地区的经济特别是工业发展的经济联系。纲领还规定实现那些在合并以前叙利亚和苏联达成协议的建筑工程和发展经济的计划。纲领中讲到保障叙利亚工人阶级的成果、它的工资和工会自由。纲领规定要实行土地改革，保证无地的农民能获得土地和在这个土地上进行经营的物质条件。纲领中提到要对帝国主义资本渗入我国的现象进行斗争，要警惕美帝国主义的手腕，以及确立同兄弟的伊拉克共和国的持久的友好关系和巩固同苏联及整个社会主义阵营的友好联系。（鼓掌）
    这个纲领获得了叙利亚人民——它的各阶层的所有爱国人士的普遍支持。它好像是民族大宪章，因为它真正提出了解决已经产生的经济、政治和社会问题的唯一可行和正确的办法，提供了摆脱叙利亚目前所遇到的那些严重困难的可能性。这个纲领指出了巩固阿拉伯联合共和国的道路和支持在整个阿拉伯世界中实行阿拉伯统一的思想。
    我们曾声明准备同一切人讨论这些问题。但是所得到的回答是禁止民主报刊，禁止一切民主出版物，成百地逮捕共产党人和进步的爱国者。
    但是要想孤立我们党是办不到的，因为极广大的人民群众、经济和商业界人士都赞成我们的观点。不管怎样，我们深信，胜利一定属于符合阿拉伯社会客观发展要求的决定方面的。我们党的政策反映着这些要求，它对于未来充满了坚定的信心。
    感谢欧洲、亚洲、非洲和美洲的所有共产党员同志们对我们民族、民主的正义斗争的同情，同志们，我向你们保证，我们党所高举的马克思列宁主义旗帜永远也不会在阿拉伯叙利亚倒下。（掌声）这个旗帜将永远高高飘扬，因为我们的人民根据亲身经验相信，这个旗帜是真正爱国主义的旗帜，是民主和社会主义的旗帜，是尊重人的旗帜，是为保护人民的利益而坚强不屈和自我牺牲的旗帜。
    人类为和平和进步、为各族人民的平等和兄弟般的团结而斗争的先锋队——伟大的苏联万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    全世界一切共产党的老大哥和先进部队——苏联共产党万岁！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
    苏联人民为建设共产主义而进行的英勇斗争万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    阿拉伯和苏联的友谊万岁！（暴风雨般的、长时间的掌声。全体起立）（附图片）
