Implementing Measures Suitably According to Time and Local Conditions
    Suzhou Prefecture's Wheat Increase Plan is Solid and Practical
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Suzhou, February 25th) To win the first battle for a bumper harvest this year, the people of all counties in Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, are adopting effective measures to increase the number of ears and grains of barley, wheat, and naked barley.
    At present, the wheat seedlings in the Suzhou area are much better than in the same period in previous years. All 2.86 million mu of barley, wheat, and naked barley in the region are growing vigorously. More than 60% have 800,000 to 1,000,000 seedlings per mu; about 30% have 600,000 to 800,000 seedlings per mu; and 5% have 400,000 to 600,000 seedlings per mu. From now until the wheat harvest, there are still more than 100 days, which is an important stage for the wheat seedlings from jointing and pregnancy to maturity. At the same time, this stage is also when floods and pests and diseases occur successively. The people of all counties in the Suzhou area are determined to take advantage of the victory and fight hard for 100 days in a down-to-earth manner, effectively do a good job in the late-stage field management of wheat fields, overcome natural disasters, and strive for a comprehensive and high yield.
    Applying fertilizer according to the growth of wheat seedlings is a major measure for Suzhou area to strive for thousand-jin wheat. Up to now, half of the wheat fields in the region have been top-dressed with three times of winter fertilizer, giving the wheat a relatively favorable growing environment from the beginning. Now, Suzhou area has put forward the requirements of "early application of spring fertilizer, skillful application of ear fertilizer, top-dressing according to seedling conditions, and classified promotion," and strive for strong seedlings, large ears, many grains and heavy grains. In the past year's fertilization, there was less early fertilizer and more late fertilizer, resulting in congenital deficiencies and excessive growth in the later stage. Some wheat fields experienced lodging, which affected the yield. This year, all counties have learned this lesson and are now adopting the method of early, fierce, and multiple top-dressing of spring fertilizer to increase the number of ears and grains. At this time, livestock manure, grass ash, and phosphate fertilizer are mainly applied. After heading, it is planned to adopt foliar fertilization and other methods to top-dress phosphate fertilizer, strive for plump wheat grains, and increase the thousand-grain weight. Five thousand commune members of ten communes including Huaqiao and Dianxi in Kunshan County, not long ago, set out more than a thousand boats to transport more than 4,000 tons of fertilizer back from Shanghai and Suzhou, and rushed to top-dress a "starting fertilizer" in the wheat fields during the Spring Festival.
    According to the natural conditions of southern Jiangsu, Suzhou Prefecture regards drainage and flood prevention as one of the important measures for increasing wheat production. In the Suzhou area, 700,000 mu of wheat fields are located in low-lying areas, where the field surface is basically level with the water surface; during the flood season, the water level is even higher than the field surface, which has a great impact on wheat growth. In addition, there is more rainfall in the spring in southern Jiangsu, with rainfall of about 100 mm in April each year, and the groundwater level is high. This not only affects the growth of wheat, but also easily causes pests and diseases. Therefore, the people of southern Jiangsu say that "waterlogging" and "disease" are "closely related." This year, there has been continuous spring rain. From February 8th to 16th, the rainfall reached more than 50 mm, and water has accumulated in the fields in many areas. Therefore, ditching and drainage has become the focus of the current summer ripening field management work in the region. In the past week, the people of the region have worked hard, newly opened and dredged more than 1 million mu of wheat ditches, and drained more than 1 million mu of accumulated water. Now, various places are establishing drainage systems according to local conditions. General areas are required to have vertical ditches along the fields, horizontal ditches at the ends of the fields, and main ditches at the junctions of fields; low-lying areas adopt small encirclements to dig ditches around the wheat fields according to the high standards of rain and flood prevention, so that ridges are connected to deep ditches, and deep ditches are connected to rivers; polder areas build contiguous dikes, with deep ditches around the dikes, and water is often pumped out of the dikes to lower the groundwater level of the wheat fields, so that the water surface inside the dikes is more than three feet lower than the field surface; in pond-center fields and pot-bottom fields, drainage channels are excavated. The depth, shallowness, size, and smallness of various ditches are adapted to each other to ensure smooth water flow. Truly achieve dry ditches when the rain stops, and no accumulated water in the fields. In Changshu County, 280,000 people, under the slogan of "Rather let people get wet in the rain, than let seedlings be flooded, and be determined to fight against spring floods with great enthusiasm and great determination," repaired and newly opened 3.12 million mu of ditches and canals in two days despite the rain. After inspection, these ditches and canals meet the standards.
    In the past years, the Suzhou area has suffered great losses from wheat scab and stem rust. Last year, the loss due to scab was 30% to 50%, and there were also many wheat spider mites and wheat aphids. This year, the density of wheat seedlings has increased, and the humidity between plants has increased, making it extremely easy for pests and diseases to breed and harm. In response, the communes in the Suzhou area are strengthening forecasting and prediction work in order to grasp the occurrence of pests and diseases and eliminate them. The region plans to spray medicine every seven days, starting from heading, to prevent scab. This year, the region needs a total of more than 360,000 dan of pesticides. At present, more than 139,000 dan have been prepared, and the remaining part is actively arranging for local industrial production and mobilizing the masses to produce indigenous pesticides on a large scale.
    While strengthening various technical measures, party committees at all levels in the Suzhou area are also innovating and constantly improving leadership methods. The region is now carrying out red flag competitions on a large scale, and will continuously organize three large-scale evaluations and inspections to promote the competition movement in depth and carry out the "five noes movement" of no third-class seedlings, no waterlogging, no pests and diseases, no lodging, and no weeds in a big way. Many communes and teams have also established a three-wheat file record system, paying close attention to the changes in the three-wheat growth process and managing the seedlings in time. According to the experience of grasping the advanced and bringing the general last year, party committees at all levels also widely exchange and disseminate advanced experience through on-site meetings, radio meetings, and other methods, and carry out the movement of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced. Therefore, a new situation has been formed in many areas where everyone is full of energy and strives to be upstream. The inspection team of Zhenze Commune in Wujiang County saw that fertilizer was not applied to the fields in time in a brigade, so they posted a big-character poster: "The shed is full of fertilizer, the three-wheat are hungry, it is really unreasonable, apply it to the fields quickly." After the big-character poster was posted, more than 20 commune members of the team immediately cleared the fertilizer in the pig sheds and manure pits and applied it to the wheat fields. Secondly, cadres at all levels in the region are also preparing to grow 30,000 mu of experimental fields, grasp the basic fields that account for 75% of the wheat field area, and adopt the method of combining cadres, the broad masses of commune members, and scientific and technical personnel to carry out scientific research work, obtain experience and lessons, and guide the large-scale production increase movement.

    因时因地制宜抓措施
    苏州专区三麦增产计划扎扎实实
    本报苏州25日电　江苏省苏州专区各县人民为打好今年大丰收的第一仗，正采用有效增产措施，给大小麦和元麦增穗增粒。
    目前苏州地区的麦苗比往年同期好得多。全区二百八十六万亩大麦小麦和元麦都生长旺盛，每亩有苗八十万到一百万株的占60％以上；每亩六十到八十万苗的占30％左右；四十万苗到六十万苗的占5％。从现在到麦收还有一百多天这期间正是麦苗从拔节孕穗到成熟的重要阶段。同时，这个阶段也是雨涝及病虫灾害相继出现的时候。苏州地区各县人民决心乘胜直上，踏踏实实地苦战一百天，狠狠地有效地把麦田后期田间管理工作做好，战胜自然灾害，争取全面高产。
    按照麦苗生长情况施肥，是苏州地区争取麦子千斤的一个主要措施。截至目前止，全区已有一半的麦田追施了三次腊肥，使麦子从一开始就有了一个比较有利的生长环境。现在，苏州地区又提出了“早施春肥、巧施穗肥、看苗追肥、分类促进”的要求，力争苗壮穗大粒多粒重。去年施肥方面早期肥少，后期肥多，形成先天不足，后期徒长，部分麦田发生倒伏现象，影响了产量。今年各县吸取这个教训，从现在起就采取早追、猛追、多追春肥的办法增穗增粒。这个时候主要追施畜粪尿，草木灰和磷肥。抽穗以后，准备采取根外施肥等办法追施磷肥，争取麦粒饱满，增加千粒重。昆山县花桥、淀西等十个公社的五千个社员，不久以前，开出千多条船，到上海、苏州运回了四千多吨肥料，春节当中赶着在麦田里追上了一次“起身肥”。
    苏州专区根据苏南的自然条件，把排水防涝作为三麦增产的重要措施之一。苏州全区有七十万亩麦田处于低洼地区，田面和水面基本相平；到了汛期，水位还高于田面，这对麦子生长影响很大。另外，苏南地区春季雨水较多，每年4月间降雨量在一百多公厘左右，地下水位又高。这不但影响麦子生长，并且容易引起病虫害。所以，苏南人民把“涝”和“病”说是“一脉相连”。今年春雨连绵，从2月8日到16日，下雨量即达五十多公厘，不少地区田间已有积水。因此，开沟排水已成为全区当前夏熟田间管理工作的中心。最近一周来，全区人民大干特干，已新开和疏通好麦沟一百多万亩，排除了一百多万亩积水。现在各地正因地制宜建立排水系统，一般地区要求达到田边有纵沟，田头有横沟，田与田相连处有总沟；低田地区按照防雨防涝高标准的要求，采取小包围的办法在麦田四周挖沟，做到畦沟通深沟，深沟通河道；圩田地区连片筑圩，圩周有深沟，经常车水出圩外，降低麦田地下水位，使圩内水面低于田面三尺以上；在塘心田和锅底田，开挖出水干道。各种沟的深、浅、大、小都互相适应，保证水流畅通。真正做到雨停沟干，田无积水。常熟县二十八万人在“宁愿人淋雨，不使苗受淹，决以天大干劲，地大决心与春涝作斗争”的口号下，两天中冒雨整修和新开沟渠三百一十二万亩。经过检查，这些沟渠都符合标准。
    苏州地区历年来遭受小麦赤霉病和秆锈病的损失极大。去年因赤霉病损失30％到50％，麦蜘蛛和麦蚜虫也很多。今年麦苗密度增加，株间湿度加大，病虫害极易滋生为害。对此苏州地区各公社正加强预测预报工作，以便掌握病虫发生规律，消灭病虫害。全区计划从抽穗开始，每隔七天喷药一次，预防赤霉病。今年全区共需农药三十六万多担，目前已准备好十三万九千多担，尚缺部分，正积极安排地方工业生产和发动群众大搞土农药。
    在加强各种技术措施的同时，苏州地区各级党委还推陈出新，不断改进领导方法。全区现在正大搞红旗竞赛，并将连续不断地组织三次大规模的评比检查，把竞赛运动向纵深推进，大张旗鼓地开展无三类苗、无涝害、无病虫、无倒伏、无杂草的“五无运动”。不少社、队还建立了三麦档案纪录制度，密切注意三麦生长过程中的变化，及时地看苗管理。各级党委还根据去年抓先进带一般的经验，通过现场会、广播会等方式，广泛交流和传播先进经验，开展学先进、赶先进、超先进的运动。因此，不少地区形成了处处鼓足干劲，人人力争上游的新局面。吴江县震泽公社检查组在一个大队看到肥料没有及时下田，就贴了一张大字报：“棚里都是肥，三麦饿肚皮，真是不合理，快快施田里”。大字报贴出后，该队二十多个社员立即出清了猪棚、粪坑里的肥料，施到麦田里。其次，全区各级干部还准备种好三万亩试验田，抓住占麦田面积75％的基本田，采取干部、广大社员和科学技术人员三者相结合的办法，开展科学研究工作，取得经验教训，指导大面积增产运动。
