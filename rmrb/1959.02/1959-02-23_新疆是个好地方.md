    Xinjiang is a Good Place
    By Our Correspondent Yang Ke Xian
    Whenever I return to the interior, many people ask me with concern about all aspects of Xinjiang. They ask whether it is hot or cold, rich or desolate, fertile or barren. They ask about its mineral resources, scenery... In short, they want to know a lot.
    None of these questions can be answered in just a few words. Especially in these years of the Great Leap Forward, when things are changing so rapidly, it is not easy to answer people's questions satisfactorily.
    What kind of place is Xinjiang?
    Xinjiang is located on the frontier of our great motherland, and its area accounts for almost one-sixth of the country's total area. To the north and south, it is bordered by the towering Kunlun and Altai Mountains, and the central part is traversed by the perpetually snow-capped Tianshan Mountains. But Xinjiang is not a mountainous area. Vast, flat plains like the Junggar and Tarim Basins are rare even in the interior. The Tarim Basin alone covers 900,000 square kilometers, which is almost the size of four British mainlands.
    Xinjiang is located in the heart of the Asian continent, far from the ocean, and most areas lack rain all year round. For example, the annual rainfall in Ruoqiang County is less than 5 millimeters. However, there is a lot of rain and snow in the Tianshan, Kunlun, and Altai Mountains. Some people think that Xinjiang has a cold climate. In fact, in relatively cold places like the foothills of the Altai Mountains and Urumqi, the average temperature in January is only about minus ten degrees Celsius. The temperature in most areas is similar to that of the North China Plain. The Turpan Basin, which is 283 meters below sea level, often has summer temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius and is known as the "Land of Fire." The climate in the Tianshan Mountains is relatively cold, but warm, spring-like pastures can still be found in winter. Summer is also the ideal place to escape the heat.
    Rich Oases
    Xinjiang's agricultural areas are mostly oases surrounded by flowing water. Almost all kinds of grains produced in the country are also produced here. Wheat production accounts for half of the region's total grain output. Rice is produced not only in the Aksu Oasis, known as the "Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall," and other warm areas in southern Xinjiang, but also in large quantities in the colder areas of northern Xinjiang such as Miquan, Changji, and Manas.
    In the past, farmland cultivation here was relatively extensive, and the average yield per unit area of grain was only about 200 jin in the highest year. After the Great Leap Forward last year, the average yield per unit area of grain in Xinjiang has reached 308.8 jin. The average yield per unit area in more than a dozen counties has crossed the Yellow River, and the yield per unit area in hundreds of thousands of mu of land has reached 1,000 jin. The total grain output of the region increased by 60% compared with 1957. Calculated by population, each person has more than 1,100 jin of grain.
    Xinjiang's cotton has a high yield and good quality. Due to the superior conditions of long sunshine hours and irrigation, this will become China's most ideal cotton-growing base. Turpan and Aksu also grow a large amount of long-staple cotton, which is very useful in the aviation and automobile transportation industries.
    Xinjiang's melons and fruits are famous throughout the country. The area planted with grapes accounts for more than half of the country's total. Hami melons are produced everywhere, and the area planted each year is hundreds of thousands of mu. Even in the dead of winter, people can still eat fresh watermelons and Hami melons. The yield per unit area of Xinjiang's melons and fruits is also increasing rapidly. Last year, the average yield per mu of nearly 10,000 mu of grapes in Turpan increased by 50%, and the highest yield per mu reached 11,359 jin. The yield per mu of Hami melons in the Gaochao People's Commune in Jiashi County, southern Xinjiang, even reached 47,150 jin.
    Animal Husbandry, Forestry and Fishery
    The grasslands in the Altai Mountains, Tianshan Mountains, and Pamir Plateau are covered with lush pastures, which are China's best natural pastures, with a pasture area of more than 750 million mu. On this vast and fertile grassland, the Yili horses, known for their height and strength, and the Yanqi horses, known for their speed, are produced, as well as the Altai sheep and Puli sheep, the largest of which weigh more than 100 kilograms. Xinjiang's fine wool sheep are even more famous throughout the country. There are now more than 6.2 million fine wool sheep of all generations in the region. It is estimated that by the end of this year, Xinjiang's sheep can be basically improved.
    Animal husbandry accounts for a large proportion of Xinjiang's national economy. The total number of livestock in the region has now reached 22.23 million head.
    Along the grasslands, climbing the slopes of the Tianshan and Altai Mountains, you can enter the primeval forests that block out the sky. The Altai Mountains are known as the "ocean of trees," and the Tianshan forest belt is more than 1,500 kilometers long.
    High mountains and dense forests are the habitats of rare birds and animals. Valuable medicinal materials such as deer antler, antelope horn, and lark nests, as well as precious furs, are produced there.
    Who knows that this northwest plateau is also rich in fish. The bighead carp in Bosten Lake is more than one person tall. The Yili River and Ertix River produce Qinghuang fish weighing dozens of kilograms. The Ulungur River is a river of fish. Every spring during the fishing season, schools of fish swim into the farmland with the canal water, and the accumulated fish often reach one or two feet thick on the edge of the field. More than 300 reservoirs built in Xinjiang after liberation are also raising a large number of fish.
    Treasures of Wasteland
    Indeed, there are still many desolate places in Xinjiang. Both the Tarim and Junggar have China's famous deserts and uninhabited areas. Xinjiang's desert area accounts for more than half of the country's desert area. When traveling in Xinjiang, you often have to travel hundreds of kilometers on uninhabited Gobi deserts. But in these Gobi deserts, there are also large areas of undeveloped wasteland. As of last year, Xinjiang had surveyed more than 266.7 million mu of wasteland, of which more than 166.7 million mu can be cultivated into farmland. This is almost equal to five times the existing cultivated land area in Xinjiang.
    Most of these wastelands contain rich natural fertilizers such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. In the lower reaches of the Tarim River, an endless expanse of peatland has also been discovered. Apocynum is famous throughout the country. This high-grade textile raw material is produced on the wasteland of Tarim, stretching for hundreds of kilometers. The wasteland also produces a large amount of reeds. The reed area around Bosten Lake alone is no less than 350,000 mu.
    The Yili mountainous area is a place that people were not familiar with in the past. In recent years, it has been discovered that there are more than 160,000 mu of primeval fruit forests there. It is estimated that the wild fruits produced annually cannot be transported by 70,000 five-ton trucks in one go. The poplar forest belt on the banks of the Tarim River is also a place rarely visited by people. After aerial surveys, it was found that the poplar forest area reached more than 15 million mu.
    Not long ago, people were a little disgusted with the vast gravel Gobi area. Now, the farmers in Turpan have planted the famous seedless white grapes on the Gobi. The survival rate is as high as 95%. The western part of the Junggar Basin is also a vast gravel Gobi, but it has now been proven to be a huge underground oil sea in China.
    Xinjiang's wasteland has been under reclamation. More than 5.6 million mu were reclaimed last year alone, which is more than one-third more than the total area of wasteland reclaimed during the first five-year plan. The wasteland newly reclaimed here after liberation is close to the total area of cultivated land in Xinjiang before liberation.
    Endless Mineral Resources
    Xinjiang's industrial resources are very rich and diverse. According to the results of geological exploration, in addition to gradually building Xinjiang into China's animal husbandry base and cotton base in agriculture, it will also be built into China's industrial base for steel, oil, coal, non-ferrous metals, textiles, and sugar.
    The Karamay oil field is already well-known throughout the country. However, Xinjiang's oil-producing areas are not limited to Karamay. In Turpan under the Flaming Mountains, in the Kuqa Depression, and in Qigu in Hutubi, as well as six other regions, there are also very promising oil-producing areas. The exploration area in the Kuqa Depression has also been confirmed as an ideal oil exploration area in China.
    Coal is everywhere in Xinjiang. The proven coal reserves are more than 1.24 billion tons. From Hami in the east to Yili in the west, along the northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains, is a wide and long coalfield area. Recently, a new coalfield was also discovered on the Gobi Desert in eastern Hami, with more than 50 coal seams, the thickest of which is 14 meters. In the past, southern Xinjiang was considered to be a coal-deficient area, but in the iron-smelting campaign, coalfields were found from the Kunlun Mountains to the Pamir Plateau.
    In the past, Xinjiang produced very little iron. In southern Xinjiang, due to the lack of iron tools, the price of a five-jin soil pickaxe was often equal to hundreds of jin of wheat. Uyghur farmers under the Kunlun Mountains had to use wooden plows to plow the land due to the lack of iron. Last year, the nationwide iron-smelting campaign opened the eyes of farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups. When they could identify iron ore, almost every county found iron ore mines. Even the railway workers who opened the Tianshan Tunnel did not expect that the stone they were breaking was iron ore. The 115.54 million tons of iron reserves that have been proven in Xinjiang are only a small part of the entire reserves.
    As for the reserves of other non-ferrous metals and rare metals such as gold, copper, tin, lead, manganese, barite, beryllium, and uranium, they are also very rich. Xinjiang also has a large number of natural raw materials for developing the chemical industry and Iceland spar and rock crystal for manufacturing optical instruments. The "crystal king" excavated by the People's Liberation Army soldiers in the Ga'er Mountain of the Altai Mountains weighed more than 3,000 jin.
    Xinjiang's hydropower resources are also very abundant. The power generation capacity of the rivers in the entire autonomous region is 25.75 million kilowatts, which is equivalent to ten times the hydropower resources of the United Kingdom.
    When we talk about the beauty and richness of Xinjiang, we do not hide the fact that Xinjiang still has large areas of wasteland, Gobi deserts, and barren mountains today. But these undeveloped virgin lands are unpolished jades and pearls buried in the sand. We should carve this jade well and dig out this pearl. We must build Xinjiang more beautiful and richer.

    新疆是个好地方
    本报记者　杨克现
    每当我回到内地的时候，总有很多人关心地问起新疆的种种。他们问这里是热还是冷？是富饶，还是荒凉？土地肥沃，还是瘠薄？他们问这里的矿藏、风光……，总之，想要了解很多问题。
    每一个问题，都不是三言两语能够概括得了的。尤其在这大跃进的年月里，情况日新月异，要较圆满地回答人们提出的问题，是多么不容易的一件事。
    新疆是个啥样的地方
    新疆地处我们伟大祖国的边疆，面积几乎占祖国的总面积六分之一。它的南北，亘绕着高大的昆仑山和阿尔泰山，中部横亘着终年积雪的天山。但新疆并不是山区，像准噶尔盆地和塔里木盆地那样辽阔、平坦的原野，在内地也是少有的。仅塔里木盆地，就有九十万平方公里。将近四个英国本土那么大。
    新疆处于亚洲大陆腹地，距离海洋远，绝大部分地区终年缺雨。如婼羌县年降雨量还不到五公厘，但是在天山、昆仑山和阿尔泰等山区，雨雪却很多。有些人以为新疆气候寒冷，其实像阿尔泰山麓、乌鲁木齐等比较冷的地方，1月份平均温度也只有零下十度左右。大部分地区的气温同华北平原差不多。在低于海面二百八十三公尺的吐鲁番盆地，夏季气温经常在摄氏四十度以上，被称为“火洲”。天山山区气候比较寒冷，但是冬季仍然可以找到温暖如春的牧场。夏季又是最理想的避暑地方。
    富饶的绿洲
    新疆农业地区大都是流水环绕的绿洲。全国出产的各种谷物这里几乎都出产。小麦产量占全疆粮食产量的一半。水稻不仅有被誉为“塞上江南”的阿克苏绿洲和南疆其他气候温暖的地区出产，就是气候比较寒冷的北疆米泉、昌吉、玛纳斯等地也都大量出产。
    过去，这里的农田耕作是比较粗放的，粮食平均单位产量最高年度只有二百来斤，经过去年的大跃进，全新疆的粮食单产平均已达到三百零八点八斤，有十多个县的平均单产跨过了黄河，有数十万亩地的单产达到了千斤。全区粮食总产量比1957年增长达60％，按人口计算，每人有粮一千一百多斤。
    新疆的棉花产量高、质量好。由于有日照时间长和水利灌溉等优越条件，这里将成为我国最理想的植棉基地。吐鲁番和阿克苏等地，还大量种植在航空、汽车运输工业上有很大用途的长绒棉。
    新疆的瓜果是全国有名的。葡萄的种植面积占了全国大半。哈密瓜遍地出产，每年种植的面积有数十万亩之多。虽然在隆冬，人们依然可以吃到新鲜的西瓜和哈密瓜。新疆的瓜果单产也提高得很快。去年吐鲁番近万亩葡萄平均单产提高了50％，而最高亩产量达到一万一千三百五十九斤。南疆伽师县高潮人民公社哈密瓜的单产更达到了四万七千一百五十斤。
    畜牧业、林业和渔业
    阿尔泰山、天山和帕米尔高原一带草原上牧草丛生，是我国最好的天然牧场，牧场面积达七亿五千多万亩。在这辽阔肥美的草原上，出产着伊犁的高头大马和健步如飞的焉耆马，以及阿尔泰羊和蒲犁羊，这两种羊最大的体重有一百多公斤。新疆的细毛羊更是驰名全国。现在全区各代细毛羊已有六百二十多万只，估计今年年底，新疆的绵羊基本上可以良种化。
    畜牧业占新疆国民经济的比重很大，全区牲畜总头数目前已达二千二百二十三万头。
    沿着草原登上天山和阿尔泰山的山坡，便可进入遮天蔽日的原始森林。阿尔泰山有“树的海洋”之称，天山林带更长达一千五百多公里。
    高山密林是栖息珍禽异兽的地方，鹿茸、羚羊角、灵雀窝等名贵的药材和珍贵的兽皮就在那里出产。
    有谁知道这西北高原还盛产鱼类。博斯腾湖的大头鱼有一人多高。伊犁河和额尔齐斯河出产几十公斤重的青黄鱼。乌伦古河是一条鱼的河流，每年春季渔汛期，游鱼成群结队随着渠水流入农田，往往地边积鱼达一两尺厚。新疆解放后修建的三百多座水库，目前也正在大量养鱼。
    荒地之宝
    的确，新疆还有许多荒凉的地方，塔里木和准噶尔都有我国著名的沙漠和渺无人烟的地带。新疆的沙漠面积占全国沙漠面积的一半以上。在新疆旅行，经常要行走在几百公里没有人烟的戈壁滩上。但在这些戈壁滩中，还有大片未开垦的荒地。截至去年，新疆概查出的荒地已有两亿六千六百七十多万亩，其中可垦为农田的有一亿六千六百七十多万亩。这几乎等于现有五个新疆耕地面积。
    这些荒地中，大部分含有丰富的氮、磷、钾等天然肥料。在塔里木河下游，还发现有一望无际的草泥炭地。罗布麻是驰名全国的。这种高级纺织原料出产在塔里木的荒地上，绵延数百公里。荒地上还盛产芦苇，博斯腾湖周围的芦苇面积就不下三十五万亩。
    伊犁山区是过去人所不熟悉的地方，近年来才发现那里有着十六万多亩原始果林，估计年产的野果用七万辆载重五吨的汽车一次也拉运不完。塔里木河畔的胡杨林带也是人迹罕到的地方，经过飞机勘查，发现胡杨林面积达一千五百多万亩。
    不久以前，人们对那广阔的砾石戈壁地带还有些讨厌。现在吐鲁番的农民却在戈壁上面栽活了全国驰名的无核白葡萄。成活率高达95％以上。准噶尔盆地西部也是一望无际的砾石戈壁，现在却探明它是我国规模巨大的地下油海。
    新疆的荒地一直在开垦中，去年一年就开出了五百六十多万亩，比第一个五年计划开荒面积总和还多三分之一。这里解放后新垦的荒地，已接近解放前新疆耕地面积的总和。
    无尽的矿藏
    新疆的工业资源，是十分丰富多样的。根据地质探勘的结果，新疆除了在农业上将逐步建成我国的畜牧业基地和棉花基地外，还将建成我国的钢铁、石油、煤炭、有色金属、纺织、制糖等工业基地。
    克拉玛依油田已经是闻名全国了。可是新疆的产油区，不仅是克拉玛依，在火焰山下的吐鲁番、在库车洼地，在呼图壁的齐古等其他六个地区，也都是极有希望的石油产地。库车洼地一带的探区，也已肯定是我国一个理想的石油探区。
    新疆的煤遍地皆是。已经探明的煤储量有十二亿四千多万吨。东从哈密西到伊犁，沿天山北麓一带，是一条宽长的煤田地带。最近，还在哈密东部的戈壁滩上发现了新的煤田，煤层有五十多层，最厚的达十四公尺。南疆过去被认为是缺煤的地方，但是在炼铁运动中，从昆仑山下到帕米尔高原都找到了煤田。
    新疆过去产铁极少，南疆因为缺乏铁工具，一把五斤重的砍土镘价格往往等于几百斤麦子。昆仑山下的维吾尔农民因为缺铁不得不用木犁犁地。去年全民炼铁运动打开了各民族农牧民的眼界。当他们能辨认出铁矿石以后，几乎是县县都找到了产铁的矿山，连打通天山隧道的铁路工人，原先也没有料到他们辟山凿洞的石方，就是铁的矿石。新疆已经探明的一亿一千五百多万吨储铁量不过是整个蕴藏量的一小部分。
    至于其他的金、铜、锡、铅、锰、重晶石、铍、铀等有色金属及稀有金属的储藏量也非常丰富。新疆还有大量发展化学工业的天然原料和制造光学仪器的冰洲石、水晶石。解放军战士在阿尔泰山支脉的伽依尔山中，挖出的“水晶王”重达三千多斤。
    新疆的水力资源也是很雄厚的。整个自治区的河流蕴藏发电能力达二千五百七十五万瓩，相当英国水力资源的十倍。
    当我们谈论新疆的美丽和富饶的时候，我们并不隐讳新疆今天还有大片荒地、戈壁滩和荒山。但是这些未开垦的处女地是未雕琢的美玉，是埋藏在沙中的珍珠，我们应该把这块美玉雕琢好，把这颗珍珠发掘出来。我们一定要把新疆建设得更美丽更富饶。（附图片）
