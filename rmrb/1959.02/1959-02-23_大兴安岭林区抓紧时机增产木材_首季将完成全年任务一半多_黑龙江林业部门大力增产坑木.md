The Greater Khingan Range forest area strives to complete more than half of the annual timber production plan in the first quarter. This leap-forward production target was set at the Greater Khingan Range Forest Area Work Inspection and Appraisal Meeting recently held by the Chinese Communist Party Hulunbuir League Committee.

In order to adapt to the needs of a greater leap forward, the state has assigned the Greater Khingan Range forest area a timber production task of four million cubic meters and forest renewal of eighty thousand hectares this year. In order to guarantee the realization of this task, which is even greater than last year, the meeting considered that it is necessary to strive to complete more than half of the timber production plan in the first quarter. The specific measures are: to continue to strengthen the leadership of the Party, adhere to putting politics in command, further implement the policy of both renewal and felling, follow the mass line in all production activities, fully utilize the existing equipment through in-depth technological revolution movement, and vigorously promote the advanced experiences created last year. The meeting also determined that in the summer, timber should still be produced where conditions permit, so as to achieve "no off-season for production in forest areas, and each season has its own focus."

(Dispatch from our newspaper in Harbin on February 22) The forestry departments of Heilongjiang Province are actively taking measures to produce more pit props to support the great leap forward in coal mine production in various places. In the first quarter, the province will produce 600,000 cubic meters of pit props. This number is equivalent to more than half of the total pit prop production of the entire last year.

The Provincial Forestry Department recently held a telephone conference of the directors of various forestry administrations and special district forestry bureaus, instructing all localities to regard pit prop production as the central task of current timber production. In order to ensure the completion of the pit prop production plan, it is necessary to give full play to the soaring enthusiasm of forestry workers and improve production and transportation efficiency. At the same time, it was decided to take the following measures: in existing logging areas, all treetop wood and small-diameter wood that can be used as pit props should be made into pit props as much as possible during afforestation; all off-grade timber that has utilization value should be made into second-class pit props as much as possible. Secondary forests, mainly broad-leaved trees, that cannot be cultivated into valuable trees should be felled in part for use as pit props. In addition, forestry workers should be mobilized to use their spare time to collect branches and small-diameter wood that can be used as pit props that were lost in the past in logging yards and along transportation routes, launching a mass movement in which everyone participates in saving wood.

    大兴安岭林区抓紧时机增产木材
    首季将完成全年任务一半多
    黑龙江林业部门大力增产坑木
    本报讯　大兴安岭林区力争在第一季度完成全年木材生产计划一半以上。这个跃进的生产指标是最近在中共呼伦贝尔盟委主持召开的大兴安岭林区工作检查评比会议上订下来的。
    为适应更大跃进的需要，国家今年分配给大兴安岭林区的木材生产任务为四百万立方公尺，森林更新八万公顷。为了保证实现这个比去年更大的任务，会议认为，必须力争在第一季度完成木材生产计划一半以上。具体措施是：继续加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，更进一步贯彻更新与采伐并举的方针，在各项生产活动中都要走群众路线，通过深入开展技术革命运动，充分发挥现有设备的作用，同时要大力推广去年创造的各项先进经验。会议还确定，在夏季，有条件的地方仍要生产木材，以便作到“林区生产无淡季，季季生产有重点”。
    本报哈尔滨22日电　黑龙江省林业部门积极采取措施，多产坑木支援各地煤矿生产大跃进。第一季度，全省将生产坑木六十万立方公尺。这个数字相等于去年全年坑木生产总数的一半以上。
    省林业厅最近召开各林业管理局、专区林业局局长电话会议，指示各地把坑木生产作为当前木材生产的中心任务。为了保证完成坑木生产计划，要发挥林业职工的冲天干劲，提高生产、运输效率。同时决定采取以下措施：在现有采伐地区，凡是可以用作坑木的梢头木和小径木，在造林时都要尽可能地造成坑木；凡是有利用价值的等外木材要尽量做成二等坑木。不能培育成珍贵树木的以阔叶树为主的次生林等，要采伐一部分作坑木。另外，要发动林业职工利用业余时间，在伐木场和运输道路两旁，搜集过去丢失的能做坑木的枝桠和小径木，掀起一个人人动手节约木材的群众运动。　（吴建民）
