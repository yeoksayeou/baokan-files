Popularize the Experience of High-Yielding Green Manure
Yang Qi

Green manure is one of the main sources of fine fertilizer in China's rural areas. In 1958, the country planted more than 63 million mu of green manure crops such as purple vetch, hairy vetch, and alfalfa. The average yield per mu was 2,500 jin of fresh grass, with a total output of more than 150 billion jin, which played a significant role in increasing crop production. According to incomplete statistics, the area sown with winter green manure crops across the country this year has increased by about 10% compared to last year. If field management can be strengthened and unit yields increased, it will provide a greater guarantee of fertilizer for this year's agricultural production. According to the plans of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hunan and other provinces, the target for fresh grass yield per mu of green manure this year is 10,000 jin. If the whole country can strive to achieve this target, then even calculated based on the green manure planting area of 1958, winter green manure alone (including the underground parts) can solve more than 800 billion jin of fertilizer. This will allow about half of the country's rice paddy area (about 200 million mu) to have 4,000 jin of green manure per mu as base fertilizer.

Currently, the yield of green manure crops varies across the country. Some areas have yields as high as tens of thousands of jin per mu, while others have yields of only over a thousand jin per mu, indicating that there is great potential to increase the unit yield of green manure.

In 1958, many places achieved large-scale high yields of green manure exceeding 10,000 jin. For example, Fengxian County in Jiangsu Province achieved a high yield of 10,000 jin of purple vetch per mu on more than 180,000 mu of land. Lishui County in Zhejiang Province also created a record of over 50,000 jin of purple vetch per mu.

Hairy vetch in Yancheng, Jiangsu and Songzi, Hubei and other places have achieved high yields of more than 10,000 to 30,000 jin. These typical examples provide us with extremely valuable experience in large-scale high yields, and popularizing these experiences is a strong guarantee for increasing green manure production.

First, to achieve high yields of green manure, it is necessary to strengthen leadership in green manure production. First of all, it is necessary to strengthen ideological leadership, because farmers in the past did not have the habit of cultivating green manure, believing that "green manure is just grass, it will grow well without cultivation." This requires continuous summarization of high-yield experiences and using facts to educate the masses about the importance of green manure cultivation. Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen technical leadership. Localities should adopt training classes, on-site visits, and organize farmers from old green manure areas to new areas to teach techniques and exchange experiences, so that the call of the leadership can be turned into the actual actions of the masses. As a result of Zhejiang Province's actions in this regard, the average yield of green manure in the province in 1958 increased from more than 2,000 jin in 1957 to 4,500 jin. Therefore, in 1959, they have the confidence to more than double it again, so that the average yield per mu of green manure in the province's more than 8 million mu will reach 10,000 jin.

Second, implement the green manure contracting production responsibility system, which is a powerful guarantee for implementing various high-yield measures. For example, the Huoxing Cooperative in Panhuo Township, Yin County, Zhejiang Province, implemented the "three-package" responsibility system in the winter of 1956. In 1957, the yield of fresh green manure grass per mu reached 5,000 jin, an increase of about 40% compared with 3,000 jin in 1956. The specific method can be that the commune stipulates a unified standard of work points, allocates tasks to the teams, and the teams designate special personnel to be responsible; or allocates the management tasks of green manure fields to households according to the number of pigs raised, implements the responsibility system of contracting labor, fertilizer, and production, or fixing people, fixed plots, fixed time, and fixed fertilizer, and conducts regular inspections and evaluations.

Third, in terms of cultivation techniques, it is necessary to master several key links such as selecting good varieties, dense planting for full stands, increasing fertilizer application, ditching for drainage, and preventing diseases and insects. At present, the most effective measures for field management are to focus on the following three aspects:

	(1) Ditching to prevent waterlogging: Green manure crops need a certain amount of moisture, but are also afraid of standing water. Because legume green manure crops have rhizobia in their roots, which can fix nitrogen from the air for use by green manure crops. Generally, the amount supplied is about two-thirds of the nitrogen content of the green manure crop. Therefore, the more rhizobia, the more active the rhizobia, the higher the yield of green manure. However, in the case of standing water, the lack of air in the soil will affect the growth, reproduction, and nitrogen fixation of rhizobia. At the same time, green manure crops are also prone to diseases or seedling death. If it encounters low-temperature water accumulation and freezing, it will also cause frost damage and affect yield. The purple vetch planted by the Wuxian Farm in Jiangsu Province only harvested 1,600 jin of fresh grass per mu in fields that did not have good ditching and drainage. Under the same other conditions, but fields with well-drained ditches that do not accumulate water had an average yield of more than 4,600 jin per mu, an increase of more than double. The size of the plots, the height of the terrain, and the clayey or sandy soil determine the number and depth of ditches. For fields that are large, low-lying, prone to water accumulation or inconvenient drainage, and have clayey soil, in addition to opening side ditches around the perimeter, it is also necessary to open horizontal or straight ditches in the middle along the water flow direction. Horizontal ditches should be dense, straight ditches should be deep, and the bottom of the ditches should be flat, so that drainage is effective. During the growing season of green manure, it is also necessary to clear the ditches in time to prevent blockage. Especially in the season of continuous spring rains, it is necessary to achieve "every ditch is connected, and the water is drained after the rain stops."

	(2) Increasing fertilizer application: Some people think that green manure is fertilizer, and applying fertilizer is a waste. However, experienced old farmers believe that applying one dan of fertilizer in the green manure field is equivalent to applying several or even a dozen dans of fertilizer in the rice field. It is "using small fertilizer to raise big fertilizer," which is very cost-effective. For example, the third team of the Xin'an Second Cooperative in Nanhui County applied four dans of pig manure per mu to three mu of green manure fields, and harvested more than 4,000 jin of fresh grass per mu. An adjacent 2.5 mu of green manure field was not topdressed, and only harvested 2,000 jin per mu. Four dans of pig manure contain about two jin of nitrogen, about one jin of phosphorus pentoxide, and about two and a half jin of potassium oxide, while 4,000 jin of purple vetch contain more than sixteen jin of nitrogen, more than four jin of phosphorus pentoxide, and more than fourteen jin of potassium oxide, and also increase a large amount of organic matter. Comparing the two, you can see that the benefits of applying fertilizer to green manure are great.

	The green manure seedlings are in the cold winter season, so the rhizobia in their roots are not very active and need fertilizer to promote strong seedlings and accumulate more nutrients for overwintering. After the ground thaws in the second year of spring, the seedlings regain their vitality and begin to grow vigorously, but most of the originally accumulated nutrients are consumed during the winter, so fertilizer is also urgently needed at this time. Although the rhizobia are actively active afterwards and can supply a part of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilizers still need external supply. Therefore, green manure should be fertilized at least twice after sowing: once with winter fertilizer, combined with warmth and frost prevention, apply about ten dans of farm manure and ash fertilizer per mu; once with spring fertilizer (also called seedling-promoting fertilizer), apply fast-acting fertilizers, such as four or five dans of human manure, eight to ten jin of superphosphate, and two or three dans of ash fertilizer. Later, you can continue to topdress based on the condition of the seedlings.

	(3) Prevention and control of diseases and insects: Green manure diseases and insects often occur in the spring when flowers bloom. Common diseases and insect pests include sclerotinia disease and flea beetles of purple vetch. Applying more ash fertilizer and phosphate fertilizer and doing a good job of drainage can prevent or reduce diseases.

In areas where diseases have already occurred, diseased plants can be shoveled up and buried in the soil five or six inches deep, and then sprinkled with lime water around (one hundred jin of water plus ten jin of lime). Flea beetles can be controlled by sprinkling 0.5% "666" powder when they occur in early spring.

In order to guarantee the great task of producing 1050 billion jin of grain and 100 million dan of cotton this year, the current fertilizer work must not only broaden the sources of fertilizer through campaigns, increase the accumulation of various farmyard and miscellaneous fertilizers, but also strengthen the leadership of green manure production, do a good job of field management, and increase the unit yield of green manure to meet the needs of increasing crop production.

    推广绿肥高产经验
    杨琪
    绿肥是我国农村主要细肥来源之一。1958年全国共种植紫云英、苕子、黄花苜蓿等绿肥作物六千三百多万亩。平均亩产鲜草二千五百斤，总产量为一千五百多亿斤，对农作物的增产起了很大的作用。据不完全统计，目前全国已经播种的冬季绿肥作物面积比去年约增加10％多，如果能够加强田间管理，提高单位产量，就将为今年农业生产提供更多的肥料保证。根据浙江、江苏、湖南等省计划，要求今年绿肥亩产鲜草一万斤。假如全国都能争取达到这个指标，那么即便按1958年的绿肥种植面积计算，仅冬季绿肥一项（包括地下部分在内），就可以解决八千多亿斤肥料，这将使全国约一半左右的稻田面积（约二亿亩左右）每亩都有四千斤绿肥作基肥。
    目前全国各地绿肥作物产量还不平衡，有的地区亩产高达几万斤，有的地区亩产就只有一千多斤，可见提高绿肥单位产量的潜力是很大的。
    1958年很多地方出现了绿肥大面积万斤丰产的事实。如江苏奉贤县在十八万多亩田地上，获得每亩万斤紫云英的高产。浙江丽水县也创造了紫云英亩产五万斤以上的纪录。
    江苏盐城、湖北松滋等地的苕子都获得一到三万斤以上的高额丰产。这些典型为我们提供了极其宝贵的大面积丰产的经验，推广这些经验就是提高绿肥产量的有力保证。
    第一，要取得绿肥丰产必须加强绿肥生产领导。首先要加强思想领导，因为农民过去对绿肥没有培育的习惯，认为“绿肥是个草，不加培育也长好”。这就需要不断总结高产经验；用事实教育群众重视绿肥培育工作。其次要加强技术领导，各地应该采用训练班、现场参观、组织绿肥老区农民到新区传授技术，交流经验，使领导的号召变成群众的实际行动。浙江省这样做的结果，1958年全省绿肥平均产量由1957年二千多斤，提高到四千五百斤，因此1959年有信心要求再翻一番多，使全省八百多万亩绿肥平均亩产达到一万斤。
    第二，推行绿肥包工包产责任制，这是贯彻各项丰产措施的有力保证。如浙江鄞县潘火乡火星社1956年冬实行三包责任制，1957年每亩绿肥鲜草产量达五千斤，比1956年三千斤提高了约40％。具体办法可由社规定统一的工分标准，把任务分配到队，由队指定专人负责；或按饲养生猪头数多少，把绿肥田的管理任务分配到户，实行包工包肥包产或定人、定地段、定时间、定肥料的责任制度，并定期检查评比。
    第三，栽培技术方面要掌握选用良种，密植全苗，增施肥料，开沟排水，防治病虫等几个环节。而目前田间管理最有效的措施就是抓以下三个方面：
      （1）开沟防渍：绿肥作物既需要一定的润湿，又怕积水。因为豆科绿肥作物根部有根瘤菌，能固定空气中氮素，供绿肥作物利用。一般供给数量约为绿肥作物含氮量的三分之二。所以根瘤愈多，根瘤菌活动愈旺盛，绿肥产量就会愈高。但是在渍水的情况下，土壤内空气缺乏就会影响根瘤菌的生长繁殖和固氮作用。同时绿肥作物也容易引起病害或死苗。如果碰到低温积水结冰，还会引起冻害影响产量。江苏吴县农场种的紫云英，没有作好开沟排水工作的田每亩只收鲜草一千六百斤。其他条件相同，但开好排水沟不积水的田，平均亩产四千六百多斤，增产一倍以上。田块大小地势高低和土质粘、砂，决定开沟数量和深浅度。田块大、地势低、易积水或排水不便、土质较粘的田，除周围开边沟外，还要在当中顺水流方向开横沟或直沟。横沟要密，直沟要深，沟底要平，这样排水才灵。在绿肥生长期间还要及时清沟，防止沟内堵塞。尤其在春雨连绵的季节，要作到“沟沟相通，雨停水尽”。
      （2）增施肥料：有些人认为绿肥是肥料，施肥是浪费。但有经验的老农却认为在绿肥田里施一担肥，抵在稻田中施几担甚至十几担肥，是“以小肥养大肥”，非常合算的事。如南汇县新安二社第三队有三亩绿肥田，每亩施四担猪厩肥，亩收鲜草四千多斤；相邻的二点五亩一块绿肥田没有追肥，每亩只收二千斤。四担猪厩肥含氮素二斤左右、磷酸一斤左右、氧化钾二斤半左右，而四千斤紫云英含氮素十六斤以上、磷酸四斤多、氧化钾十四斤以上，还增加大量有机质。两相比较，就可看出绿肥施肥好处很大。
    绿肥幼苗期间正是严冬季节，所以它根部的根瘤菌活动不旺盛，需要肥料，促使壮苗多积蓄养分供越冬之用。第二年春季开冻后，幼苗恢复生机，开始生长旺盛，但是原来积蓄的养分大部在越冬期间消耗掉，所以这个时候也迫切需要肥料。此后虽然根瘤菌旺盛活动，可供应一部分氮素，但磷、钾肥料仍旧需要外界供应。因此，绿肥播种后最少要施两次肥：一次腊肥，结合保暖防冻，每亩施用厩肥及灰肥十担左右；一次春肥（又叫催苗肥）施用速效肥料，如人粪尿四、五担，过磷酸钙八到十斤，灰肥二、三担，以后还可以陆续看苗追肥。
      （3）防治病虫：绿肥病虫往往发生在春暖花开的时候，常见的病虫害有紫云英的菌核病和菜金花虫。多施灰肥磷肥，作好排水工作，可以防治或减少病害。
    在已发生病害地区，可以把病株铲去，就地埋在五、六寸深的土里，四周再撒上石灰水（一百斤水加十斤石灰），菜金花虫可以在春初发生时撒0.5％的“六六六”粉防治。
    为了保证今年生产粮食一万零五百亿斤，棉花一亿担的伟大任务，当前肥料工作既要通过运动广辟肥源，增积各种农家土杂肥料，也要加强绿肥生产领导，作好田间管理，提高绿肥单位产量，以满足农作物增产的需要。
