    Resolutely Counterattack the Colonialists
    Speech by Prince Harsai at the Welcome Meeting Held by Three Chinese Organizations
    Gentlemen,
    On behalf of myself and all members of the delegation, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the director and members of the Islamic Association for giving me the opportunity to introduce the struggle of the Arab people of Oman to you, the children of the great Chinese people, and to expose the suffering brought to the Arab people of Oman by imperialism and its pawns.
    Friends! The current struggle in Oman is not the first chapter in the rich history of struggle of our people, but only one stage in the entire struggle, which has taken different forms at different stages. The Arab people of Oman in the Middle East have waged and are still waging this struggle. And the great Chinese people have waged the same struggle and have already won victory. The struggle in Oman is a struggle to defend national dignity, a struggle to defend the entire Asia, and a struggle to win human dignity and happiness.
    Today, the forces of good and progress are engaged in a fierce struggle with the forces of evil and exploitation. The imperialists are racking their brains to regain a foothold in Asia. Therefore, the imperialist strategists have taken a fancy to our country, believing that this place is most suitable for establishing their base of aggression and making it a stronghold for plotting against the national liberation movements in the Arab East and friendly countries. In addition, as described by the imperialist newspapers, many regions of our country, especially the Fufud area, have mythically rich oil resources. The unhealthy brains of the imperialists have always dreamed of controlling our country's resources and driving our people to serve their aggressive purposes in order to create greater crimes. However, our heroic people stand firm in the storm and resolutely counterattack the crimes of the colonialists with all their strength. Our peaceful land has been bombed, innocent and unarmed people have been massacred, mothers and children live in insecurity, the British navy has imposed a blockade, and the enemy has implemented a policy of terror and suppression in the occupied areas, but all this cannot weaken the will of freedom fighters. Britain has banned journalists and Red Cross personnel from entering the areas that have been brutally bombed, in an attempt to cover up their crimes. Their huge propaganda machine describes large-scale military operations as police pacification actions. However, no matter what, the people of conscious and friendly countries, based on their own personal experience, are able to see through this kind of lies.
    The aggressors have forgotten that the era of imperialist high-handedness is gone forever, and a new spirit is developing in the world. The progressive Arab national movement, the crystallization of the experience of the Asian people's just struggle—the Bandung Principles—inspires the Omani people to persist in their struggle against the colonialists.
    Independent development and the establishment of a happy and democratic society where all people are equal is the aspiration and goal of the Omani people's struggle. However, Britain wants our people to submit to a dictatorial and autocratic reactionary regime, to submit to the rule of feudal lords who are controlled by oil monopolies and who sell out national interests and state interests. The Omani people see themselves as an integral part of the Arab nation, and they want to make an effective contribution to the construction of the Arab nation.
    Our people know that the people of Asia and Africa stand by them and support their struggle, and our people have also found allies among the people of other free countries. We firmly believe that the world freedom movement is an indivisible whole. Any victory won by the people of any country in the struggle against the contemporary scourge—imperialism—is a victory for the people of other countries and a major step forward in the cause of striving for human happiness and liberation.
    People say: Adversity reveals who your friends are. If this is the case, our people, like the people of other Arab countries, believe that the great Chinese people are loyal friends in the great cause of defending national independence and national liberation.
    Today, we are waging a brutal struggle against the enemies of mankind, the unrepentant executioners. We call on our friends to loudly condemn the various means used by imperialism to strangle and destroy our people, such as prohibiting representatives of the Red Cross from entering enemy-occupied areas, and mistreating prisoners of war who were once heroic soldiers and are now imprisoned in the terrible prisons of Muscat.
    In order to repel the enemy troops invading our country and repel these paper tigers, our people need medicine, as well as food and clothing, and only friends who have experienced anti-imperialist struggles can extend a generous helping hand to us.
    Finally, I am able to have the opportunity to gather with you all, and I would like to once again express my gratitude to the members of the Islamic Association, and thank the great Chinese people and their wise government for supporting the struggle of our people, and thank them for their welcome to us.
    Long live the eternal friendship between the Arab people of Oman and the great Chinese people!
    Let us strengthen and consolidate the solidarity and friendship between the people of Asia and Africa!

### 全力回击殖民主义者  哈尔塞亲王在中国三团体欢迎大会上的讲话

    全力回击殖民主义者
    哈尔塞亲王在中国三团体欢迎大会上的讲话
    诸位先生：
    我谨以个人的名义并代表全体团员，向伊斯兰教协会主任和委员们表示深深的谢意，感谢他们给我机会，向你们这些伟大的中国人民的儿女，介绍阿曼阿拉伯人民的斗争，揭露帝国主义及其走狗给阿曼阿拉伯人民带来的苦难。
    朋友们！当前阿曼的斗争并不是我国人民丰富的斗争史上的第一章，而只是在不同阶段中采取不同方式的整个斗争中的一个阶段，中东阿曼阿拉伯人民过去进行过，现在还在进行着这场斗争。而伟大的中国人民曾经进行过同样的斗争，并已取得胜利。阿曼的斗争是保卫民族尊严的斗争，是保卫整个亚洲的斗争，也是争取人类尊严与幸福的斗争。
    今天，善良与进步的力量和邪恶与剥削的力量在进行着剧烈的斗争，帝国主义者处心积虑要在亚洲再次站稳他们的脚根，因而，帝国主义的战略家们看上了我们的国家，认为这块地方最适于建立他们的侵略基地，并使之成为阴谋反对阿拉伯东方和友好国家民族解放运动的据点。此外，还因为像帝国主义的报纸所描写的那样，我国许多地区，尤其是夫伏德区，有着神话般丰富的石油资源。帝国主义者不健康的脑袋，一贯梦想控制我国的资源，驱使我国人民为他们的侵略目的效劳，以制造更大的罪行。然而，我们英勇的人民屹立在暴风雨中，全力而坚决地回击殖民主义者的罪行。我们安宁的国土遭到轰炸，手无寸铁的无辜的人们遭到屠杀，母亲和儿童过着不安的生活，英国海军实行封锁，敌人在占领区实行恐怖、镇压政策，但这一切都不能够削弱自由斗士的意志。英国禁止记者和红十字会人员进入遭受残酷轰炸的地区，企图掩盖他们的罪行。他们庞大的宣传机器，把大规模的军事行动，说成是警察的绥靖行动。然而，不管怎么样，有觉悟的友好国家的人民，根据自己亲身的体验，是能够识破这种谎言的。
    侵略者忘记了帝国主义横行霸道的时代已经一去不复返了，世界上正在发展着一种新的精神。进步的阿拉伯民族运动、亚洲人民正义斗争的经验结晶——万隆原则鼓舞着阿曼人民坚持对殖民主义者进行斗争。
    独立发展和建立一个幸福的、全民平等的民主社会，是阿曼人民的愿望和斗争的目标。但是，英国却要我国人民屈从于一个专制独裁的反动政权，屈从于受石油垄断集团控制的出卖民族利益和国家利益的封建主的统治。阿曼人民把自己看成是阿拉伯民族不可分割的组成部分，他们要对建设阿拉伯民族作出有效的贡献。
    我们的人民知道，亚非人民和他们站在一边，支持他们的斗争，我们的人民还在其他自由国家的人民中找到同盟者。我们深信，世界自由运动是一个不可分割的整体，任何一国人民在反对当代毒瘤——帝国主义的斗争中所取得的任何胜利，都是其他各国人民的胜利，也是在争取人类幸福和解放的事业中跨进了一大步。
    人们说：患难中可以看出谁是朋友，如果是这样的话，我国人民也和其他阿拉伯国家的人民一样，认为伟大的中国人民是捍卫民族独立与民族解放的伟大事业的忠实朋友。
    今天，我们正在进行残酷的斗争，反抗人类的敌人，怙恶不悛的刽子手。我们呼吁朋友们高声谴责帝国主义为扼杀与毁灭我国人民而施展的种种手段，比如禁止红十字会代表进入敌占区，虐待曾经是英勇战士而如今被投入马斯喀特恐怖监狱里的战俘。
    为了击退进犯我国的敌军、击退这些纸老虎，我国人民需要医药，也需要吃和穿，而只有有过反帝斗争经历的朋友们才能向我们伸出慷慨援助的手。
    最后，我们能有机会和你们欢聚一堂，我再一次向伊斯兰教协会的委员们表示谢意，感谢伟大的中国人民和他们英明的政府支持我国人民的斗争，感谢他们对我们的欢迎。
    阿曼阿拉伯人民和伟大的中国人民的永恒友谊万岁！
    让我们加强与巩固亚非人民之间的团结和友谊！
