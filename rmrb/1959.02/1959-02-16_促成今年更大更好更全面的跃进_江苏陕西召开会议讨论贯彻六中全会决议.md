Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 15th: The Third Session of the Third Jiangsu Provincial Congress of the Communist Party of China, held from January 29th to 31st, called on all Party organizations and people in the province to continue to oppose conservative thinking, build on the great victories and rich experience achieved last year, make persistent efforts, and strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. The meeting emphasized that striving for a bumper harvest of summer crops and striving to complete and overfulfill the first quarter's industrial production plan are of decisive significance for achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. All Party members and people in the province should unite as one and strive with the force of a tiger descending the mountain to achieve victory in the first battle of the year and a greater leap forward in 1959.

The meeting, in accordance with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session Resolution of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the specific conditions of Jiangsu Province, discussed and formulated a plan for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959. According to the plan, the province's output of steel, coal, grain, cotton, and other products will have significant increases, and other heavy industries, light industries, and agricultural and sideline production will also have significant developments. The meeting pointed out that the key to achieving a greater leap forward in agricultural production this year lies in the winter and spring seasons. During the winter and spring, a mass movement for accumulating and applying fertilizer should be launched, and field management of overwintering crops such as wheat, rapeseed, and green manure should be strengthened; a water conservancy construction movement and an agricultural tool reform movement should be carried out, and preparations for spring sowing should be made early to strive for bumper harvests of summer crops and early autumn crops; and a basic farmland system should be implemented in a planned manner to drive large-scale, high-yield harvests. On the industrial front, we must continue to implement the policy of taking steel as the key link and promoting an all-round leap forward. County and commune industries should continue to focus on serving agricultural production, and currently, they must especially focus on repairing agricultural tools and manufacturing new agricultural tools to ensure that the needs of spring and summer production are met. Other fronts should also strengthen their work according to the needs of industrial and agricultural production and their own capabilities.

The meeting believes that comprehensively rectifying and consolidating the people's communes is a major and urgent political task at present. In the next three months or so, rural work should focus on rectifying and consolidating the people's communes. In the work of rectifying the communes, production should be the central task, the lives of commune members should be properly arranged, various management systems should be established and improved, and the organization, Party members, and cadres' work style should be rectified. At the same time, a group of cadres with experience in mass work should be drawn from leadership organs above the county level to enrich and strengthen the commune Party committees to ensure the Party's absolute leadership over the communes.

The meeting pointed out that strengthening the Party's leadership and giving full play to the Party's leading role are the fundamental guarantees for the successful realization of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. We must strengthen the Party's centralized and unified leadership over national construction and strengthen the Party's ideological and organizational work. Leaders at all levels must establish the idea of "the whole country as one chess game" and criticize decentralism and departmentalism. In leadership work, we must continue to adhere to the mass line, continue to overcome the "three winds" and "five airs," appear as ordinary laborers, discuss problems with the masses with sincerity, care about the masses' thoughts, production, life, and study, and persist in having grassroots cadres eat, live, and labor with the masses, truly integrating with the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 15th: The Third Session of the Second Shaanxi Provincial Congress of the Communist Party of China called on all Party members and cadres to continue to oppose right-leaning conservative thinking, lead the people of the province to quickly launch a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, and strive to complete this year's leap forward plans.

This meeting was held from January 8th to 31st. In accordance with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session Resolution of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the meeting summarized the experiences of the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement in 1958 and discussed the 1959 Shaanxi Provincial National Economic Development Plan. Before the start of the meeting, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a preparatory meeting from December 30, 1958, to January 7, 1959.

At the congress, Zhang Desheng, the first secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, conveyed the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session Resolution of the Eighth Central Committee and Chairman Mao's speech. Zhao Boping, the secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, gave a work report entitled "Struggle for a Greater, Better, and More Comprehensive Leap Forward." Wang Lin, the secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, gave an explanation on the draft of the 1959 Shaanxi Provincial National Economic Plan.

During the discussion of the draft of the 1959 Shaanxi Provincial National Economic Plan, the representatives unanimously agreed that this was a plan for a greater leap forward, and that it was positive and reliable, but also a very arduous task. The meeting believed that there were many favorable conditions for completing this year's industrial and agricultural production tasks. In industry, the mass movement for running industry by the whole people has a preliminary foundation, and Party committees at all levels have gained some experience. In agriculture, summer crops are much better than last year in terms of sowing, deep plowing, close planting, and fertilization; the irrigated area has increased by more than two times compared with last year and continues to increase; the realization of communization and the improvement of the communist consciousness of the broad masses have brought extremely favorable conditions for achieving a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. The meeting pointed out: To achieve this year's production targets, we must implement the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, continue to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction and various policies, and adhere to the two most basic experiences of putting politics in command and launching mass movements on a large scale.

The meeting made arrangements for the current work, requiring the province to quickly launch a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. In industry, we must strive to bring the production of major industrial products to the level required by the quarterly plan within two months. In the spirit of "the whole country as one chess game," the capital construction departments should fully guarantee the progress of key projects and continue to carry out mass movements centered on saving raw materials, rapid construction, and improving project quality. Grasping the current agricultural production is the key to achieving a greater leap forward in agriculture this year. We should break through the summer harvest barrier one after another. Currently, we should quickly launch an agricultural production upsurge centered on fertilizer accumulation and combine production with the work of rectifying the people's communes.

In order to quickly launch an upsurge of all-round leap forward on all fronts of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs in the province, the representatives unanimously believed that it is necessary to continue to oppose conservative thinking and break down superstitions. To this end, Zhang Desheng, the first secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, gave a report to the conference entitled "Be a Warrior on the Ideological Front." He said that the process of the Great Leap Forward in Shaanxi Province in 1958 was a process of constantly opposing right-leaning conservative thinking. After a year of practice, the right-leaning conservative thinking of most leading organs and most cadres has been continuously overcome. The revolutionary vigor and revolutionary style of the broad masses of cadres have also been greatly improved. However, the degree of ideological emancipation is not very consistent. Zhang Desheng pointed out that to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, we must draw on the experience of the rectification movement, carry out ideological struggles more deeply, more meticulously, and more frequently in Party organizations at all levels, and continue to oppose right-leaning conservative thinking. He said that it should be recognized that carrying out this ideological struggle is the first hurdle to achieving a greater leap forward this year, and this is the key to doing all work well.

    促成今年更大更好更全面的跃进
    江苏陕西召开会议讨论贯彻六中全会决议
    据新华社南京15日电　1月29日到31日举行的中共江苏省第三届代表大会第三次会议，号召全省党组织和全省人民继续反对保守思想，在去年取得的伟大胜利和丰富经验的基础上，再接再厉，争取今年更大更好更全面的跃进。会议强调指出，力争全省夏熟作物的大丰收，力争完成和超额完成第一季度工业生产计划，对实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进具有决定性的意义。全省党员和全省人民团结一致，以猛虎下山之势，为实现今年首战胜利和1959年更大跃进而奋斗。
    会议根据党的八届六中全会决议的精神和江苏省的具体条件，讨论和制订了1959年更大更好更全面跃进的规划。根据规划，全省钢铁、煤炭、粮食、棉花等产量都将有很大的增长，其它重工业、轻工业和农副业生产也都将有很大发展。会议指出，要实现今年农业生产更大的跃进，关键在于冬春。冬春期间要开展全民性的积肥、追肥运动，加强三麦、油菜、绿肥等越冬作物的田间管理；开展水利建设运动和农具改革运动，及早做好春播的准备，争取夏熟作物和早秋作物的大丰收；并有计划地推行基本田的制度，带动大面积高额丰收。在工业战线上，要继续贯彻执行以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针。县、社工业应该继续以为农业生产服务为主，当前特别要抓紧农具修补和新农具的制造，以保证满足春夏生产的需要。其他各个战线也要根据工农业生产的需要和本身的可能加强工作。
    会议认为，全面整顿和巩固人民公社，是当前一项重大的迫切的政治任务。在今后三个多月内，农村工作应当以整顿和巩固人民公社为纲。在整社工作中要以生产为中心，妥善安排社员的生活，建立和健全各项管理制度，整顿组织，整顿党员和干部的作风。同时，从县以上领导机关中抽调一批有群众工作经验的干部，充实和加强公社党委，保证党对公社的绝对领导。
    会议指出，加强党的领导，充分发挥党的领导作用，是胜利实现今年更大更好更全面跃进的根本保证。必须加强党对国家建设的集中的统一的领导，加强党的思想工作和组织工作。各级领导必须树立“全国一盘棋”的思想，批判分散主义和本位主义思想。在领导工作中要继续坚持走群众路线，继续克服“三风”“五气”，以普通劳动者的姿态出现，和群众推心置腹地商量问题，关心群众的思想、生产、生活和学习，坚持基层干部和群众同吃同劳动，真正和群众打成一片。
    据新华社西安15日电　中共陕西省第二届代表大会第三次会议，号召全省党员干部继续反对右倾保守思想，带领全省人民迅速掀起一个更大更好更全面的跃进高潮，为完成今年的各项跃进计划而奋斗。
    这次会议从1月8日到31日举行。会议根据党的八届六中全会决议的精神，总结了1958年大跃进和人民公社运动的经验，讨论了1959年陕西省国民经济发展计划。在会议开始前，中共陕西省委曾在1958年12月30日到1959年1月7日召开了预备会议。
    在代表大会上，省委第一书记张德生传达了八届六中全会决议的精神和毛主席的讲话，省委书记赵伯平代表省委作了题为“为争取更大更好更全面的跃进而斗争”的工作报告，省委书记王林代表省委作了关于1959年陕西省国民经济计划（草案）的说明。
    代表们在讨论1959年陕西省国民经济计划草案时，一致认为这是一个更大跃进的计划，是积极的、可靠的，任务也是十分艰巨的。会议认为完成今年工农业生产任务有许多有利条件。在工业方面，全民大办工业有了初步基础，各级党委也有了一定经验。在农业方面，夏熟作物在播种、深翻、密植、施肥等方面都比去年好得多；灌溉面积比去年增加了两倍多，并且还在继续增加；公社化的实现和广大群众的共产主义觉悟的提高，为实现工农业生产的更大跃进带来了极为有利的条件。会议指出：为实现今年各项生产指标，必须贯彻执行党的八届六中全会的决议，继续贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和各项方针政策，坚持实行政治挂帅和大搞群众运动这两条最基本的经验。
    会议对当前工作作了安排，要求全省迅速掀起一个更大更好更全面的跃进高潮。在工业方面要力争两个月内使主要工业产品的生产达到季度计划要求的水平。基本建设部门根据“全国一盘棋”的精神，全力保证重点工程的进度，继续开展以节约原材料、快速施工、提高工程质量为中心的群众运动。抓紧当前的农业生产，是实现今年农业更大跃进的关键。应该一个接一个地攻破夏季丰收关，当前要迅速掀起以积肥为中心的农业生产高潮，并结合生产搞好整顿人民公社的工作。
    为了在全省工农商学兵各个战线上迅速掀起全面跃进的高潮，代表们一致认为必须继续反对保守思想，破除迷信。为此，省委第一书记张德生向大会作了题为“做思想战线上的勇士”的报告。他说，陕西省1958年大跃进的过程，也就是不断反对右倾保守思想的过程。经过这一年的实践，大部分领导机关和多数干部的右倾保守思想不断地得到了克服。广大干部的革命干劲和革命风格也大大提高了。但是，思想解放的程度不很一致。张德生指出，1959年要争取更大、更好、更全面的跃进，就必须吸取整风的经验，在党的各级组织中更深入、更细致、更经常地开展思想斗争，继续反对右倾保守思想。他说，应该认识到开展这种思想斗争是实现今年更大跃进的头一关，这是做好一切工作的纲。
