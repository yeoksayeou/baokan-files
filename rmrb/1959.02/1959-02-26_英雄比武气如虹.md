Around noon, on a newly built road in the western suburbs of Beijing, the sounds of gongs and drums suddenly shook the sky, and the din of voices erupted. From a gate beside the road, hundreds of people surged out, carrying huge banners, laughing and chatting all the way, singing and shouting slogans, heading towards a large auditorium in the east.

At this time, the north wind stopped blowing, the cold subsided, and the originally gloomy sky seemed to be infected by the joy of the people, and suddenly revealed a smiling face with warmth. The sun came out!

It turned out that this was the entire staff of the Lengfeng Machinery Factory, taking advantage of the fact that it was a Sunday holiday and the first day of February, and specially held a "Lengfeng Workers' February Competition." It was only because the factory was small, and the workshops were still scattered in several large warehouses for production, and the departments were still working in rows of sheds, that it was impossible to find a place that could accommodate all the personnel to concentrate on the competition. They had no choice but to go to someone else's auditorium. But don't look at the narrow and simple exterior of this factory, its production is quite energetic. During the Great Leap Forward last year, they did not lag behind; in the first month of this year, they were even at the forefront. In fact, their production and workload planned for the first quarter of this year are much higher than those of the fourth quarter of last year. Because of this, some employees initially had ideological problems. Fortunately, the Party General Branch promptly launched a factory-wide debate on obeying national interests, and all employees unified their thinking and enthusiastically threw themselves into the "Four Goods and One Skill" movement. What are the four goods? Good at putting politics in command, good at achieving daily production plans, good at being bold and careful about safety, and good at caring for the collective and abiding by discipline. What is one skill? Use hands and brains, and discuss skills in work. However, February is short, and there is also a Spring Festival holiday in between, making it somewhat difficult to complete the task. The holiday should naturally be taken, and the only solution is to use more brains and think of ways in work. So, let's have a competition to see who has more energy and skill?

Look, the Party General Branch Secretary was the first to jump onto the stage. He read a slogan: "Across February, the task is great, but Lengfeng workers are not afraid, fight to the last minute, resolutely implement the daily plan, be fully present before and after the festival, and everyone plants a red flag." Then he asked, "Does everyone agree?" A thunderous shout of "Agree" came from below, and a storm of applause immediately rang out.

Before the applause subsided, a man with a full beard walked calmly onto the stage, slowly unfolded a piece of paper and read, "We challenge the Third Workshop..." Several middle school students who had just come to the Third Workshop for an internship whispered, "How funny! Who is he?" A nearby apprentice replied, "Hey, this is our Second Workshop's Master Zhang Futing! The shock team he led installed the trailer turntable last month, increasing efficiency by four times, that was really outstanding! He worked the night shift yesterday and just got off work, what's so funny about that?"

Master Zhang had not yet stepped down from the stage after reading the challenge, and Old Xia from the First Workshop went up to the stage. There was immediately a small commotion in the audience. Everyone knew that this was a humorous character. He was originally a fitter and is now the deputy director of the workshop. At this moment, he was wearing a set of Chinese-style blue cotton-padded clothes and trousers, holding a large red envelope, his fair face stretched tight, and he said seriously to everyone, "Yesterday we picked up the waste iron slag that others had thrown away and made insulating fiber, hey, this stuff is in short supply on the market!" As he spoke, he grabbed a handful of gray, soft, and fluffy stuff from the red paper package, shook it, suddenly narrowed his eyes, smiled, and nodded towards the lower left of the stage, saying, "After the Spring Festival, I'm afraid you'll get stomach problems. Our workshop will refuel, mass produce, and mass supply, so you won't have time to digest it, and you can taste the flavor of stomach problems." These words were double-edged and very witty, and people laughed when they thought about it.

Immediately afterwards, the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Workshops, all departments, the Party, the government, the labor union, the Communist Youth League, master craftsmen, new apprentices, fitters, male workers, female workers, one after another, went on stage to compete. Individuals with individuals, units with units, you challenge, I accept, I chase you, you catch up with me, no one gives in, no one forgives, everyone is a hero, everyone is a heroine. This one said, "The January task is completed over the quota, and February production will be even more energetic." That one said, "Overcome difficulties and seize time, and rely on brainstorming to work."

Bold statements were constantly being made on the stage, and applause rang out from the audience from time to time. It was getting late, but slips of paper requesting to speak and compete kept flying up, and those who had not yet had their turn were eager to try and restless. The Chairman of the Labor Union glanced at his watch and, after discussing with the Secretary of the General Branch and the factory directors, decided that the meeting would come to an end for the time being. Summarizing everyone's opinions, they determined: No debts before the Spring Festival, no absenteeism during or after the Spring Festival, and a good start after the Spring Festival!

Although the competition was over, the excitement remained, and the workers' self-edited, self-directed, and self-performed entertainment programs followed one after another. But many people didn't feel like watching the show and were still discussing, saying, "Who is a hero and who is a heroine, we'll see the difference in production!"

    英雄比武气如虹
    梅为
    晌午时分，北京西郊一条新修的马路上，忽然锣鼓震天，人声鼎沸，从道旁一家大门里唿啦一下涌出来好几百人，抬着一副副巨额标语，一路笑语喧哗、唱歌喊口号，朝东头一个大礼堂走去。
    这时候，北风停吹，寒气消退，原是阴霾的天，仿佛也受到了人间这片欢闹的感染，顿时露出笑脸暖意，太阳出来了！
    原来，这是冷风机械厂的全体职工，乘着这天是星期休假，又是2月的头一天，特地举行一个“冷风工人2月份比武大会”。只因厂里地方小，眼下各车间还分散在几个大仓库里生产，各科室还在一排排工棚里办公，哪里找得出一个能容纳全部人马集中比武的场所来？只得跑到别人的礼堂去。可是你别看这厂外表狭窄、简陋，生产却挺带劲。去年大跃进，他们毫不落后；今年第一个月，他们更是走在前列。事实上，他们今年第一季度计划的生产品和工作量远比去年第四季度高。为这个，有些职工开初思想还不通呢。好在党总支及时展开了一场全厂服从全国利益的大辩论，全体职工才统一了思想，轰轰烈烈地投进了“四好一巧”运动。你道是哪四好？政治挂帅好，日产计划实现好，胆大心细安全好，关心集体遵守纪律好。哪一巧？动手动脑，干活论巧。可是2月时间短，又夹着一个春节休假，完成任务有些困难。休假自然应该休的，只有在工作中更加动脑筋想办法来解决了。那末，比一比吧，看谁干劲更大更巧？
    瞧，党总支书记第一个跳上台去。他念了一段口号：“跨二月，任务大，冷风工人却不怕，战到最后一分钟，坚决实行日计划，节前节后出全勤，满堂红旗人人插。”接着问道：“大家同不同意？”底下打雷似的一声喊“同意”，立时响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    掌声未绝，有个满面胡须的汉子不慌不忙地走上台去，慢吞吞地展开一张纸来念道：“我们向三车间挑战”……。台下几个刚来厂里三车间实习的中学生窃窃私议道：“真逗！他是谁呀？”旁边一个徒工回道：“嗨，这是我们二车间张福亭老师傅呗！他领导的突击小组上月安装拖车转盘，提高效率四倍，那真叫出色！昨儿个他上夜班，这会儿才下工呢，有什么逗的？”
    张师傅念完挑战书还没走下台来，一车间的老夏走上台去了。台下立时一阵小骚动。谁都知道，这是个风趣横生的人物。他原是钳工，现在是车间副主任。此刻穿着一套中式的蓝棉袄裤，夹着一个大红包，白净的脸皮绷得紧紧的，一本正经地对大伙说：“我们昨天把人家扔掉的废物铁渣捡来，做成了绝缘用的纤维，嘿，这玩意市上可缺货啊！”说着，从红纸包里撮出一团灰蒙蒙软绵绵的东西来，抖了抖，忽然迷细了眼睛，笑嘻嘻地朝台左底下一点头，说道：“春节以后，我怕你们要得胃病了。我们车间要加油，大量生产，大量供应，叫你们来不及消化，尝尝胃病的滋味。”这番话，一语双关，顶俏皮，人们一回味，都笑起来了。
    紧接着，一、二、三、四各车间，各科室，党、政、工、团，老师傅、新徒工，钳工、男工、女工，一个挨一个，纷纷上台比武。个人与个人，单位与单位，你挑战，我应战，我追你，你赶我，谁也不让，谁也不饶，个个是好汉，人人是英雄。这个说：“一月任务超额完，二月生产更有劲。”那个讲：“战胜困难抢时间，干活要靠动脑筋。”
    台上不断发出豪言壮语，台下不时响起满座掌声。时间不早了，还接连飞上去要求讲话比武的纸条子，没轮到的跃跃欲试，坐立不安。工会主席一瞧手表，跟总支书记、厂长们一商量，决定大会告一段落，综合大家意见，确定：春节以前不欠债，春节前后不缺勤，春节以后开门红！
    比武虽过，余兴未尽，接连着就演出了工人们自编自导自演的文娱节目。可是好多人没心瞧戏，还议论纷纷，说道：“谁算好汉谁英豪，咱们生产里头见分晓！”
