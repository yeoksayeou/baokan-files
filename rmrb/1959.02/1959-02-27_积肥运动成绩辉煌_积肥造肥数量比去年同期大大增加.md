The nationwide manure accumulation and production has achieved brilliant results in the heat of the battle to fight for fertilizer and get grain from fertilizer. This has not only prepared a large amount of topdressing fertilizer for current wheat and rapeseed, but also prepared a certain amount of base fertilizer for spring-sown crops. This is one of the important material foundations for striving for a greater leap forward in agricultural production this year.

This nationwide blitz of manure accumulation and production campaign is a continuation of the manure accumulation and production work in various places since last winter. After the instructions on the blitz of manure accumulation and production campaign issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council at the end of January, various places carried out a nationwide general mobilization, re-arranged labor forces, and quickly set off a climax of manure accumulation and production with the methods of fixing people, quantity, quality, time, remuneration, and rewards. Party committees at all levels, like leading the nationwide iron and steel production last year, took charge by the Party Secretary and strengthened the leadership over the fertilizer front. The labor force invested in the manure accumulation and production campaign generally accounted for 20% to 30% of the total rural labor force in each province.

In the process of everyone doing it and everyone accumulating and producing manure, the quantity of natural farm manure has increased sharply, and the production of indigenous chemical fertilizer has also greatly developed. According to preliminary statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture based on twenty-six provinces (municipalities, and regions), the accumulated amount of various natural farm manures has greatly increased compared with the level of manure accumulation in the same period last year; indigenous chemical fertilizer has created a new record in the production of indigenous chemical fertilizer in our country.

In order to ensure that the quantity of manure accumulation and production is large and the quality is good, many places have carried out activities such as competitions, visits, evaluations, and inspections. Tangshan Prefecture in Hebei Province carried out a manure accumulation and production competition with the content of ten checks and ten comparisons (checking plans and comparing actions, checking measures and comparing implementation, checking progress and comparing quality, checking tasks and comparing completion, checking attendance and comparing numbers, checking determination and comparing effort, checking leadership and comparing depth, checking tools and comparing reform, checking inventions and comparing creation, etc.), which played a powerful role in promoting the increase in manure accumulation quantity and quality. Many places paid attention to strengthening technical guidance and carrying out fertilizer effect identification to improve quality in the manufacturing of indigenous chemical fertilizer. It is estimated that the various natural crude fertilizers that have been accumulated in many areas currently account for about 70%, and the accumulated fine fertilizer and the produced indigenous chemical fertilizer account for about 30%; in some places, the proportion of fine fertilizer is even greater. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong and other provinces have paid attention to strengthening the field management of green manure this year, carried out ditching to prevent collapse, used small fertilizer to nourish large fertilizer, prevented and controlled plant diseases and insect pests, and strived to increase the fresh grass yield per unit area of green manure, so as to prepare the base fertilizer for early rice.

Due to the sharp increase in the quantity and quality of natural farm manure and indigenous chemical fertilizer, not only has the nutrients needed for wheat and rapeseed growth been supplied in large quantities, but also coarse and fine fertilizers have been prepared for spring-sown crops. At present, the amount of fertilizer applied to wheat fields in major wheat-producing areas is generally three to four times higher than in the same period last year. The base fertilizer prepared for spring-sown crops in various places has increased much more than in previous years.

According to the large amount of manure accumulation and the tight rural labor force, various places have vigorously promoted the experience of accumulating and producing manure in the fields, accumulating manure, composting manure, and fumigating manure in the fields; some areas, according to the conditions, implemented cattle pens, pig pens, and sheep pens to the fields. Many places also paid attention to reforming the tools for accumulating, producing, transporting, and applying fertilizer, especially focusing on the reform and promotion of tools for transporting fertilizer, so that fertilizer transportation was mechanized by vehicles and boats, and cableways were used, increasing labor efficiency several times. The youth of Chenggu County, Shaanxi Province, cultivated more than 21,000 mu of wheat and rapeseed fields, and each piece of land had "one pit, one tower, and one factory," taking materials locally and manufacturing locally. Calculating only the accumulated fertilizer, it can save more than 58,000 labor workdays for fertilizer transportation. With fertilizer taking the lead, it drove various agricultural activities in rural areas. Like this year's overwintering field management, spring sowing preparation, tool reform, sideline production, and patriotic health campaign, under the promotion of fertilizer taking the lead, they were all done better than last year. At present, the manure accumulation and production campaign is being carried out in depth in various places. (Attached pictures)

    积肥运动成绩辉煌
    积肥造肥数量比去年同期大大增加
    本报讯　在为肥而战，向肥要粮的热火朝天的斗争中，全民积肥、造肥已取得辉煌的成绩，这不仅为当前小麦、油菜准备了大量的追肥，还为春播作物准备下了一定的底肥。这是争取今年农业生产更大跃进的重要物质基础之一。
    这次全民性的突击积肥、造肥运动，是去冬以来各地积肥、造肥工作的继续。在1月底中共中央和国务院的突击积肥、造肥运动的指示下达后，各地进行全民总动员，重新安排劳动力，以定人、定量、定质、定时、定报酬和奖的办法，很快的掀起了积肥、造肥高潮。各级党委像去年领导全民大办钢铁一样，党委书记挂帅，加强了对肥料战线的领导。投入到积肥、造肥运动中的劳力，一般省都占到了农村总劳力的20％到30％。
    在人人动手，大家积肥造肥中，农家自然肥料的数量猛增，土化肥生产也有很大的发展。据农业部根据二十六个省（市、区）初步的统计，已积各种农家自然肥料比去年同期积肥水平大大增加；土化肥则创造了我国土化肥生产的新纪录。
    为了保证积肥造肥数量多、质量好，不少地方开展了竞赛、参观、评比检查活动。河北省唐山专区开展了十查十比（查计划比行动、查措施比落实、查进度比质量、查任务比完成、查出勤比人数、查决心比干劲、查领导比深入、查工具比改革、查发明比创造等）为内容的积肥造肥竞赛，对提高积肥数量和质量起了有力的推动作用。许多地方对土化肥的制造，注意了加强技术指导，进行肥效鉴定，提高质量。据估计，许多地区目前已积的各种自然粗肥约占70％左右，积的细肥和生产的土化肥约占30％左右；有的地方细肥所占的比重还要大。江苏、浙江、湖北、湖南、广东等省，今年都注意加强了绿肥的田间管理，进行了开沟防溃，以小肥养大肥，防治病虫害，力争提高绿肥单位面积的鲜草产量，为早稻准备下底肥。
    由于农家自然肥料和土化肥的数量猛增，质量提高，这不但使小麦和油菜生长所需要的养料得到了大量的供应，而且还为春播作物准备下了粗细肥料。目前主要产麦地区的麦田施肥量一般比去年同期增加三、四倍。各地为春播作物准备的底肥，都比往年增加了许多。
    各地根据积肥量大和农村劳动力紧张的情况，大力推行了田头积肥造肥的经验，在田头积肥、沤肥、熏肥；有的地区根据条件，实行牛圈、猪圈、羊圈到田。许多地方还注意改革积肥、造肥、运肥、施肥工具，特别是重点改革推广运输肥料的工具，作到运肥车、船化，索道化，提高劳动效率好几倍。陕西省城固县青年，他们培育的二万一千多亩小麦和油菜田，每块地都做到有“一坑、一塔、一厂”，就地取材，就地制造，仅按已积的肥料计算，可节省运肥劳动工日五万八千多个。肥料挂帅带动了农村各种农事活动。像今年越冬田间管理、春播准备、工具改革、副业生产和爱国卫生运动等，在肥料挂帅的推动下，都比去年搞得好。现在各地积肥造肥运动正在深入开展。　（附图片）
