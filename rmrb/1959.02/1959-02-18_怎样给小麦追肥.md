How to Topdress Wheat
    Liang Deyin

After the Spring Festival, the weather gradually warms up, and wheat is about to turn green. According to analysis, wheat absorbs about 60% of its total nutrient intake from the soil from the greening stage to the heading stage. During this period, it is necessary to apply fertilizer several times to promote the rapid recovery of wheat seedlings and consolidate the tillers from before winter, so that these tillers can all head and achieve high yields.

The experience of high-yield wheat fields in various regions in 1958 proves that topdressing of wheat in stages should be carried out in winter and spring, depending on the nature of the fertilizer. Slow-acting fertilizers such as soil manure, stable manure, compost, and pig manure should be applied early before the wheat turns green, spreading them on the wheat field (i.e., "montou fen" or "warm fertilizer"). When the wheat field thaws in early spring, the soil moisture is sufficient, and the nutrients in the fertilizer will dissolve in the water and seep into the soil for absorption by the wheat. Human excrement and urine are fast-acting fertilizers and have a better effect when used as topdressing. Now is a good time to irrigate wheat with urine. From the current irrigation to the wheat jointing stage, there are still about two months. Irrigating 1,500 jin of urine per mu can increase wheat production by 100 jin. A production team of 1,000 people can discharge 2,000 jin of urine per day, which can irrigate 80 mu of land in two months. This is a very large source of fertilizer and should be fully utilized. Spring topdressing of nitrogen chemical fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate, has the best yield-increasing effect. However, the amount of nitrogen chemical fertilizers is currently small and should be applied rationally at the most appropriate time. Experiments have shown that the wheat jointing stage is a critical period for nutrition. Applying fast-acting nitrogen fertilizer at this time can increase the effective tillering rate and increase the number of grains per ear.

Phosphorus chemical fertilizers, such as superphosphate, should in principle be used as base fertilizer. If used as topdressing, it should also be applied early and in combination with irrigation. Plant ash is a fast-acting potassium fertilizer. Many high-yield fields in 1958 applied plant ash in the spring. A survey in Wutong County, Henan Province, showed that topdressing with plant ash can reduce wheat lodging. On the basis of increasing the application of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers, it is of positive significance to apply plant ash as potassium fertilizer.

How many times should topdressing be applied? How much should be used each time? This should be determined according to different soil conditions, the source of fertilizer, and the yield target. According to the survey of high-yield wheat fields with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu in Henan and other provinces in 1958, the number of topdressing applications in stages is generally six or seven times, three or four times in winter and three or four times in spring. Winter is mainly for applying farmyard manure such as soil manure and compost, and spring is mainly for fast-acting fertilizers and chemical fertilizers. The amount of coarse fertilizer used is very large, ranging from 5,000 jin to tens of thousands of jin each time. The amount of human excrement and urine applied is about 1,000 jin each time. For chemical fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate, apply 15 jin each time, but no more than 30 jin at most.

In addition to topdressing according to the wheat's growth stage, it is also necessary to topdress based on the condition of the seedlings. Topdressing based on the condition of the seedlings is to topdress based on the color of the wheat leaves and the intensity of growth. If the color is light green or yellowish and the growth is slow, it indicates a lack of fertilizer, and fast-acting fertilizer should be applied in time. If the wheat leaves are dark green, the leaves are curled and drooping, and the wheat stalks are thin and weak, it indicates that there is too much nitrogen fertilizer. Nitrogen fertilizer should be stopped, or some potassium fertilizer should be applied. Mastering the amount and timing of nitrogen fertilizer application is the most important part of rational fertilization. Increasing the application of nitrogen fertilizer can increase production, but too much will cause lodging, or excessive vegetative growth, late maturity, and reduced production. Spring topdressing must be combined with irrigation to achieve greater fertilization effects.

    怎样给小麦追肥
    梁德印
    春节以后，天气逐渐转暖，小麦即将返青。根据分析，小麦从返青到抽穗，从土壤中吸收的养分占总吸收量的60％左右。在这个时期，需要分数次追施肥料，才能促进麦苗迅速恢复生长，巩固冬前的分蘖，使这些分蘖都能抽穗，从而获得高产。
    1958年各地小麦高产田经验证明，小麦分期追肥应根据肥料的性质，分别在冬季和春季施用。土粪、厩肥、堆肥、猪粪等迟效性的肥料，应提早在小麦返青以前追施，撒铺在麦田上（即蒙头粪或暖肥），当早春麦地化冻的时候，土壤水分充足，肥料中的养分即被水溶解渗入土中，供小麦吸收。人粪尿是速效性的肥料，用做追肥，效果更好。当前是用尿浇麦的好时节，从目前浇施到小麦拔节，还有两个月左右的时间，每亩浇尿一千五百斤，可增产一百斤小麦。一千人的生产队，每日可排尿二千斤，两个月可浇地八十亩。这是一项很大的肥源，应充分利用。小麦春季追施氮素化学肥料，如硫酸铵等，增产效果最好。但是目前氮素化肥数量较少，应选择最适宜的时间，合理施用。试验证明，小麦拔节期是营养的关键期，此时追施速效性氮肥，可以提高有效分蘖率及增加每穗结实粒数。
    磷素化学肥料，如过磷酸钙等，原则应做基肥施用。如果用做追肥，也应提前早施，并应结合灌水。草木灰是速效性钾肥，1958年有很多丰产田都曾在春季施用草木灰。河南省梧桐县曾做过调查，追施草木灰能减轻小麦的倒伏。在增施氮磷肥的基础上，配合施用草木灰做钾肥，是有积极意义的。
    究竟分几次追肥？每次用多少？这应按照不同土壤条件、肥料的来源和产量的指标而定。根据1958年河南等省亩产千斤以上的小麦高产田的调查，分期追肥的次数一般都在六、七次，冬季三、四次，春季三、四次。冬季以施用土粪、堆肥等农家粗肥为主，春季以速效肥料和化学肥料为主。粗肥的用量很大，每次施用五千斤到数万斤不等。追施人粪尿的用量，每次在一千斤左右。硫酸铵、硝酸铵等化学肥料，每次追十五斤，最多不超过三十斤。
    除了根据小麦发育时期追肥以外，还需要看苗追肥。看苗追肥是根据麦叶的颜色、生长强度，进行追施肥料。如果颜色浅绿或发黄，生长缓慢，就是缺肥现象，应及时追施速效肥料；如果麦叶生长浓绿，叶子发卷下垂，麦秆细长软弱，这是氮肥过多的现象，应停止追施氮肥，或施用一些钾肥。掌握氮肥的施用量和施用时期，是合理施肥最重要的一环。增施氮肥能增产，但过多了会发生倒伏，或贪青徒长、晚熟而减产。春季追肥必须结合灌水，才能发挥更大的施肥效果。
