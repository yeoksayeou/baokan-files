    In Wushan County, Gansu Province, snow has been falling continuously for days, and the wind is biting cold, but it cannot stop the enthusiasm of the people of Wushan County for accumulating fertilizer. The person shoveling fertilizer in front is Zhao Xixiang, a demobilized soldier and member of the Communist Youth League. He is full of energy in the fertilizer accumulation campaign, and everyone calls him "the vanguard in battle."
