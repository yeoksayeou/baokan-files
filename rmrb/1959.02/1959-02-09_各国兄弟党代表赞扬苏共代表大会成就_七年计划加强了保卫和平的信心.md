Representatives of Fraternal Parties from Various Countries Praise the Achievements of the CPSU Congress
    The Seven-Year Plan Strengthens Confidence in Defending Peace
    (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 8th) According to TASS, representatives of foreign fraternal party delegations who were invited to participate in the 21st Congress of the CPSU have recently published articles in Soviet newspapers and made speeches on Moscow Television, warmly praising the achievements of this congress.
    "Soviet Russia" published articles by Ho Chi Minh, Chairman and General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, and Guyot, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, on February 6, hailing the achievements of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
    Ho Chi Minh wrote in his article that the Soviet Union's seven-year plan for building communism will definitely be completed and overfulfilled. The Soviet Union will undoubtedly surpass the most developed capitalist countries economically, and the Soviet people will enjoy the highest spiritual and material living standards in the world. This will not only bring happiness to the Soviet people but also strengthen the strength of the entire socialist camp.
    Ho Chi Minh said that if the Asian and African people who are determined to fight for their national independence clearly see that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people always sympathize with and help them, then with the Soviet Union's seven-year plan for building communism, they will be more convinced of the inevitable collapse of capitalism and colonialism. As a result, they will further consolidate their unity with the Soviet people and the socialist camp and will more resolutely carry out the struggle against colonialism, so that their struggle will achieve complete victory more quickly.
    Guyot pointed out in his article that the 21st Congress of the CPSU has international significance and is full of profound internationalist spirit. Guyot said that the work and resolutions of this congress have made a significant contribution to the cause of people of all countries developing the struggle against imperialism, against colonialism, and against exploitation and oppression. We will draw new strength from the achievements of the Soviet Union.
    Yugov, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Chairman of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers, wrote in "Soviet Russia" on February 8 that the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU are a magnificent program for the comprehensive construction of communist society in the Soviet Union. This resolution is also a program for all socialist countries, the international communist movement, and the workers' movement to fight for peace, democracy, and socialism. The article said that Khrushchev's report reflects the basic characteristics of the socialist and communist development of the Soviet Union, and these basic characteristics are suitable for the common laws of every socialist country. Yugov pointed out that Khrushchev's report is a valuable contribution to the theory and practice of communist construction.
    Heinrich Lau, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, wrote in "Moscow Truth": All the speeches at the 21st Congress of the CPSU, especially Khrushchev's inspiring report, unfolded the prospect of a communist society before our eyes. All the speeches of the delegates to the congress and the great enthusiasm of the Soviet people will be a full guarantee for the realization of all plans in the coming years.
    Fok Yeno, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, emphasized in his article to "Moscow Truth" that after the Soviet people realize the seven-year plan, they will take a big step forward on the road of communist construction.
    Pajetta, Secretary of the Central Secretariat of the Italian Communist Party, wrote in "Soviet Russia" that Khrushchev's concluding remarks reflected his full confidence in the strength of the Soviet Union and his hope for peaceful coexistence and cooperation with all countries, which is the most reliable guarantee of peace.
    Pollitt, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party, Hill, member of the Central Political Committee of the Australian Communist Party, Buck, General Secretary of the Labor-Progressive Party of Canada, and McCalla, member of the Political Committee of the Executive Committee of the New Zealand Communist Party, delivered speeches on Moscow Television on February 7. They all evaluated the working results of the 21st Congress of the CPSU.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 8th) Local newspapers today published Kadar, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, on his remarks made in Moscow to reporters of "People's Free Press" and the Hungarian News Agency regarding the 21st Congress of the CPSU.
    Kadar pointed out that the seven-year plan adopted by the congress opened a new era of social progress in the lives of the Soviet people. The Soviet people have entered the second and higher stage of socialist society - they are building a communist society.
    Kadar also said that after the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the Hungarian working people also saw their future prospects more clearly.
    Speaking of the role of the 21st Congress of the CPSU in defending peace, Kadar stressed that the congress once again struck a blow to the imperialist aggressors and the frenzied advocates of the "Cold War." From the point of view of consolidating world peace, it was a particularly important event. Kadar said that the Soviet Union's consistent Leninist policy of peace and the new grand plan for peaceful construction give us more confidence in defending peace. (with picture)

    各国兄弟党代表赞扬苏共代表大会成就
    七年计划加强了保卫和平的信心
    据新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：应邀参加苏共第二十一次代表大会的外国兄弟党代表团的代表们，这两天来在苏联的报纸上发表文章和在莫斯科电视台发表讲话，热烈赞扬这次代表大会的成就。
    “苏维埃俄罗斯报”6日刊载了越南劳动党中央委员会主席兼总书记胡志明和法国共产党中央委员会政治局委员居约的文章，欢呼苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的成就。
    胡志明在文章中写道，苏联建设共产主义的七年计划一定能够完成和超额完成。苏联在经济方面无疑地要超过最发达的资本主义国家，苏联人民将享有世界上最高的精神和物质生活水平。这不仅会给苏联人民带来幸福，而且会加强整个社会主义阵营的力量。
    胡志明说，如果坚决为自己国家民族独立而斗争的亚非人民清楚地看到了苏联共产党和苏联人民始终同情和帮助他们，那末，现在有了建设共产主义的苏联七年计划，他们就会更加深信资本主义和殖民主义崩溃的必然性。这一来，他们就将更进一步地巩固他们同苏联人民和社会主义阵营的团结，就将更加坚决地进行反对殖民主义的斗争，使得他们的斗争更快地取得彻底胜利。
    居约在文章中指出，苏共第二十一次代表大会具有国际意义，它充满了深刻的国际主义精神。居约说，这次代表大会的工作和决议，对各国人民发展反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义、反对剥削压迫的斗争的事业，作出了重大贡献，我们将从苏联的成就中取得新的力量。
    保共中央政治局委员、保加利亚部长会议主席于哥夫8日在“苏维埃俄罗斯报”上写道，苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议是苏联全面展开共产主义社会建设的宏伟纲领。这个决议也是所有社会主义国家、国际共产主义运动和工人运动为和平、民主、社会主义而斗争的纲领。文章说，赫鲁晓夫的报告反映了苏联的社会主义和共产主义发展的基本特点，这些基本特点适合每一个社会主义国家的共同规律。于哥夫指出，赫鲁晓夫的报告是对共产主义建设的理论和实践的宝贵贡献。
    德国统一社会党中央政治局委员、德意志民主共和国副总理海因里希·劳在“莫斯科真理报”上写道：苏共第二十一次代表大会上的所有的发言，特别是赫鲁晓夫的令人鼓舞的报告，在我们的眼前展开了共产主义社会的远景。代表大会代表的所有发言和苏联人民的巨大热情将是在最近几年实现所有的规划的充分保证。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、书记处书记福克·耶诺在他给“莫斯科真理报”写的文章中强调指出，苏联人民实现七年计划后，将在共产主义建设道路上前进一大步。
    意大利共产党中央书记处书记巴叶塔在“苏维埃俄罗斯报”上写道，赫鲁晓夫的总结发言中反映出对苏联的力量充满信心，希望同各国和平共处和合作，这是和平的最可靠的保障。
    英国共产党执行委员会主席波立特、澳大利亚共产党中央政治委员会委员希耳、加拿大劳工进步党总书记布克、新西兰共产党执行委员会政治委员会委员麦卡拉7日在莫斯科电视台发表了讲话。他们都评价了苏共第二十一次代表大会的工作成果。
    据新华社布达佩斯8日电　此间的报纸今天都登载了匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会第一书记卡达尔在莫斯科对“人民自由报”和匈牙利通讯社记者发表的关于苏共第二十一次代表大会的谈话。
    卡达尔指出，代表大会所通过的七年计划在苏联人民的生活中揭开了社会进步的新时代。苏联人民已进入社会主义社会的第二个、也就是较高级的阶段——他们正在建设共产主义社会。
    卡达尔又说，我觉得，在苏共第二十一次代表大会以后，匈牙利劳动人民也更加清楚地看到了自己的未来的前景。
    在谈到苏共第二十一次代表大会在保卫和平方面的作用时，卡达尔着重指出，代表大会又一次打击了帝国主义侵略者，打击了“冷战”的疯狂拥护者，从巩固世界和平的观点来讲，它是一个特别重要的事件。卡达尔说，苏联一贯奉行的列宁主义的和平政策以及和平建设的新的宏伟计划，使我们更有信心保卫和平。（附图片）
