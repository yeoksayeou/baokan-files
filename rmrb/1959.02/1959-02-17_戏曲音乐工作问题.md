Issues in Opera Music Work
    Ma Ke
    Music is an important component of opera, and the development of opera must address musical issues.

    Since liberation, under the guidance of the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," opera has seen great development, and its music has also taken on a new look. In recent years, the spontaneous and chaotic state of opera development has been basically corrected; toxins and unhealthy elements in opera music have been eliminated; many excellent heritages have been rescued, and through sorting and processing, they have been used for the present; many small and growing opera genres have been supported, thus making the opera music garden more lush and colorful.

    It should be mentioned here that many music workers have done a lot of work and achieved great results. Naturally, this is the result of unity and cooperation and mutual learning between music workers and performers.

    However, there are also shortcomings and errors in the work, especially around 1955-1956, when a serious erroneous tendency of replacing the old with the new and crude reform occurred. The result of doing so was alienation from the masses and from the performers. This erroneous tendency was later criticized. The criticism was necessary, timely, and achieved the desired positive effect. However, some criticisms lacked sufficient reasoning and analysis, and did not affirm that achievements were the main aspect, and some people criticized crudeness from a conservative point of view, thus creating some negative influences.

    Today, opera is also undergoing great development along with the great leap forward in production and various cultural endeavors. Since the Ministry of Culture held a symposium on opera depicting modern life last year, opera has made great achievements in depicting modern life. The task that the times have placed on opera is glorious and arduous. How should comrades engaged in opera music work make further efforts? How to avoid repeating past mistakes? This involves some issues of understanding and practice, and exploring these issues is beneficial to the work.

              The Laws of Opera Music

    Opera has a long history, and opera music has formed its own unique style and laws in its development, which are sufficient to distinguish it from European opera or newly created operas.

    From the perspective of its connection with traditional music, opera music has widely absorbed the essence of national music. When the Northern and Southern Dynasties songs were formed, they absorbed music from the Han Dynasty acrobatics to the Tang and Song Dynasty folk songs, storytelling, and dance music. Since then, opera music has continued to develop, but it has never interrupted its connection with traditional music and folk music, and they have influenced each other. Therefore, various expression techniques and means in opera music, such as melodies, arias, singing methods, gongs and drums, and string and wind instruments, are very rich and characteristic.

    From the perspective of its role and position on the opera stage, opera music, as an organic part of a comprehensive art, maintains a harmonious relationship with other parts. It has never been emphasized to a unique or primary position. In the entire performance, it gives full play wherever it is good at and competent; wherever it is not good at and competent, it retreats to a secondary position or gives way to other artistic means to express it. Needless to say, this does not mean reducing the importance of music; on the contrary, this often makes the role of music more prominent and forms a unique expression technique.

    There are basically two types of expression techniques in opera music: one is mainly developed from melodic elements, and the other is mainly developed from rhythmic elements. The one developed from melodic elements includes techniques such as collecting sentences, collecting tunes, violating tones, and violating keys, until a whole set of structural principles is formed that fully utilizes the contrast, echoing, comparison, and setting off effects of various different tunes. The music of China's oldest opera genres and many local operas today are composed based on this principle. The one developed from rhythmic elements is mainly based on a basic tune, making various changes in tempo, beat, and rhythm, which can usually be summarized into four types of beats: slow (one beat three eyes), medium (one beat one eye), fast (with beat without eyes), and free (without beat without eyes or tight beat slow singing), but the actual changes are infinite.

  This technique was already used in ancient dance music, but it seems that it became a major expression technique of opera and was fully developed starting from Bangzi Opera. Because this technique is rich in dramatic expression and profound inner portrayal, it has been more widely used in modern opera.

    These two techniques are not opposed to each other. In fact, very few opera genres simply adopt one technique, but mostly adopt one as the main one and the other as the auxiliary one, or adopt both, according to the traditional conditions of the opera genre and the needs of expression.

    These traditional expression techniques certainly have shortcomings, especially under the influence of depicting modern life and foreign musical culture, it needs further development. Many principles in European musical structure (such as the principle of sonata) as well as harmony, counterpoint, symphonicization and other techniques are worth referring to and absorbing. Needless to say, this is a very difficult task, because to absorb foreign components, it is necessary to have a deep, rather than superficial, understanding of foreign things, and at the same time, and more importantly, to have a correct understanding of traditional things. Although opera music has excellently completed its task in a long historical period, its laws have not been well summarized. Today, our understanding of it, whether from an aesthetic or technical point of view, is still not deep enough and our understanding is not enough. In this case, once we want to absorb foreign things, we often lose traditional things.

      Realism and Romanticism in Opera Music

    In the study and application of the laws of opera music, there is a view that the traditional techniques of opera music are to put the same tune on different characters, and cannot accurately portray the characters' images like the leading motif development method of European opera. Therefore, it violates the realistic creation method.

    This view is worth discussing.

   The realistic creation method is mainly manifested in whether the exposure of life is true and how deep it is, and does not lie in what means and techniques are adopted. Realism of course requires a high degree of performance skills, but this still needs to be based on the authenticity of life.

    From the materials we have obtained, almost all the basic tunes of opera music are derived from folk music, many of which are work songs sung by the masses during labor, and many are the most popular folk songs and dance music in the local area. These tunes were collectively created by the masses in generations of life struggles. After thousands of trials, they are vivid and touching. In expressing the thoughts and feelings of the masses, it should be said that they have grasped the essence and are profound and typical. As for saying that these tunes cannot clearly express the image of a specific thing, this is the characteristic of music art itself. It cannot accurately describe the specific image of things like language art or plastic art. Music is the language of emotion, and it mainly reflects reality by describing the changes in the inner emotions of the characters. It also has the ability to describe objective things (the so-called modeling), but this is not what it is best at.

    Looking at the creation method of opera music from this perspective, we can understand that it is in line with the spirit of realism. This is especially manifested in the creation of the performers. When they create a character, they always put themselves in the position to ponder their mental state, and then carefully portray their identity, personality, language, tone, and emotional rhythm, so it is very real and moving. The character images created by Mr. Mei Lanfang in operas such as "The Drunken Concubine" and "Universe Lock," from the perspective of music (the aria of the main character), also have a realistic spirit.

    For hundreds of years, countless predecessors have left us a rich musical heritage. These excellent arias and melodies have touched the audience for generations, inspiring their enthusiasm for life struggles and inspiring their beautiful life ideals. These heritages are worth studying and learning from, and cannot be denied because they do not conform to some of the concepts of laws and techniques we have obtained from European music. The excellent realistic tradition in opera is often combined with romanticism, and this is also the case in music. This combination is not only manifested in writing ideals from the content, such as the butterfly transformation of "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," but also more passionate and enthusiastic in the expression techniques, making right and wrong more clear, love and hatred stronger, and making the character images more prominent, more ideal, and more typical. From this perspective, not only the music of "Butterfly Transformation" has a romantic atmosphere, but also the music of "Meeting at the Tower" and "Crying at the Tomb" (especially the performance of this scene in Bangzi Opera) is a combination of realism and romanticism. It can be said that there is no excellent aria in opera that does not have a romantic spirit to some extent, especially because music itself is a language of emotion. Without sufficient emotion and without exciting enthusiasm, it is impossible to create an exciting tune.

    Oppose Crudeness, Also Oppose Conservatism. It now seems that the key to the problem lies in the understanding of tradition. Tradition originally has a positive side and a negative side. Underestimating the former and only seeing the latter will lead to crudeness in work; conversely, it will lead to conservatism. Whether it is crudeness or conservatism, it will eventually lead to the death of tradition.

    Underestimating tradition is often associated with blindly worshiping Western dogmatic ideas, and as a result, you want to reform opera by creating new operas. Some comrades believe that the main problem is not here, but that some policies in the past were not clear, such as saying that "new opera" is "new opera." This is actually a misunderstanding. The past said that new opera is also a new opera, which is aimed at the idea that only recognizes opera, does not recognize opera, or takes opera as high and opera as low, and proposes from a broad aesthetic meaning that our opera is also a kind of our national opera. There is nothing wrong with this statement. Of course, this does not mean that in daily work, opera and opera should be confused, and opera groups and opera groups should be confused. On the contrary, the past policy was very clear, that is, "let a hundred flowers bloom," that is, respect tradition, learn from tradition, respect artists, rely on artists, give full play to the characteristics of this opera genre, avoid confusion with other opera genres, and especially avoid replacing opera reform by creating new operas. It can be seen that we cannot find the root of crudeness from the policy and direction, and this root still comes from blindly worshiping Western dogmatism.

    At the same time, the kind of conservatism that is stuck in its old ways is also what we must oppose. Conservatives only see this side of tradition and abandon the other side. In their view, tradition is omnipotent and does not need innovation and development. It is best to keep everything the same as it was decades ago. Conservatives wave the banner of maintaining tradition and respecting the audience's appreciation habits, but in reality, artists and the broad masses who truly understand tradition and understand life are not conservative. They want both tradition and innovation.

    Conservatism has various manifestations.

    For example, in terms of singing, they oppose any foreign elements. As long as a note or a syllable deviates from the ancient tradition of this opera genre, they will oppose it and think that it is crude.

    In terms of the orchestra, they oppose adding musical instruments. Not only can Western musical instruments never be added, but ethnic musical instruments can only be limited to the few that this opera genre already has. They cannot be added. Adding them is destroying tradition. If this opera genre has only percussion instruments and no other instruments, they advocate always using percussion instruments for accompaniment to maintain the "style." If someone attempts to experiment with adding melodic instruments, they will also oppose it. In some places, in order to limit the development of the orchestra, they will fill in the orchestra pit so that the orchestra will return to the stage.

    In terms of vocal music, they also believe that traditional things only have essence and no dross. Therefore, things like "exploded sounds" and "yin and yang voices"... are only allowed to be said well, not allowed to be questioned, and oppose any innovative experiments and oppose any second possible approach other than this.

    Of course, this does not mean that objections cannot be raised to any innovation, otherwise it would be conservative. Innovation always has shortcomings and often requires some planned experiments. We oppose crudeness and oppose blind innovation, but we should give care and support to true innovation and experiments carried out in accordance with the laws of opera development, and not set some rules and regulations for innovation according to a subjective standard. The history of opera development is the best witness to opera innovation. All history shows that opera has developed by boldly absorbing and bravely creating under the constant reflection of the requirements of new life content. If it is said that opera can no longer absorb or develop in terms of existing expression tools, methods, and techniques, then where did all of this come from? The history of opera itself denies conservatism, and conservatives cannot stand their ground.

    Opera Music Work Should Take the Mass Line

    The future of opera is bright.

    A few years ago, some people still doubted whether opera could enter a socialist society, whether it could serve socialism, and whether local operas would be eliminated or merged... These have been answered by facts.

    In the future, opera will also enter a communist society as a most popular art, and will continue to develop with the improvement of people's cultural life, becoming broader in subject matter and content, and richer and more refined in expression forms.

    Regarding the mass character of opera art, we have underestimated it in our past work, especially in music work. We lack a deep understanding of the degree of the masses' love for opera, their aesthetic views, and that they not only demand to be able to appreciate it, but also demand that they can sing and perform themselves... Therefore, we often adopt the creation methods of general musical works, written by composers, sung by actors, and listened to by the audience. This method often fails when used in opera music work.

    The working method of opera music, from the meaning of its mass character, may be said to be a kind of "small local group" method. That is to say, small changes should be made, developed on the basis of tradition, adapted to the requirements of the broad masses, and even require the masses to participate in the creation.

    This naturally does not mean that composers cannot compose in opera music work; composition is often needed, but it cannot become a main method. Moreover, if we do not understand the concept of composition so narrowly, making partial, not very large, developments to traditional arias is also a kind of composition. Usually, this kind of creation is always completed in a collective way, rather than in an individual way. That is to say, actors, professional music workers, instrumentalists, and even directors participate in joint design and research, and repeatedly test and revise it among the masses. This is a major method of opera music work.

    Will this reduce the role of professional music workers and affect their enthusiasm? As long as professional music workers proceed from the actual situation of opera music, their enthusiasm can be greatly brought into play. For example, studying the creative methods of traditional excellent arias requires a lot of effort. Even today, some actors with creative talents have more perceptual knowledge and experience, but lack rational generalization, so they cannot improve their creative level faster. This part of the work needs to be quickly supplemented by professional music workers. In addition, improving life experience and ideological cultivation is also a very important task, otherwise it will be difficult to participate in this collective creation and play a role in the creation.

    Some comrades think that since opera music work should take the mass line, and since creation should rely on artists, then professional music workers are dispensable. This is obviously wrong. Of course, today it is not necessary to equip professional music cadres in every opera troupe in the country, but some key state-owned troupes, especially in places where there is already a foundation, professional music cadres are still needed. Many actors have never doubted the role of professional music cadres, and they are very much in need of such collaborators.

    In short, we must mobilize all positive forces; we must inherit tradition and dare to innovate; we must grasp its laws and also see its tomorrow; only in this way can opera music develop faster.

    戏曲音乐工作问题
    马可
    音乐是戏曲的重要组成部分，戏曲的发展必须解决音乐问题。
    解放以来，在“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针指导下，戏曲有很大的发展，音乐方面也出现了新的面貌。几年来基本上纠正了戏曲发展的自流状态和混乱局面；肃清了戏曲音乐中的毒素和不健康的东西；抢救了许多优秀的遗产，经过整理、加工，使古为今用；扶持了许多正在成长中的小剧种，从而在音乐上使得戏曲的百花园更加繁茂多采。
    这里应该提到许多音乐工作者做了很多工作，取得很大成绩。自然，这是音乐工作者和艺人团结合作、互相学习的结果。
    但工作中也有缺点和错误，特别是在1955—1956年左右，发生了以新代旧、粗暴改革的严重错误倾向。这样做的结果是脱离了群众，脱离了艺人。这种错误倾向后来受到了批评。批评是必要的、及时的，也收到应有的积极效果。但有些批评说理和分析不够，没有肯定成绩是主要的，也有些人是以保守观点来批评粗暴，因此产生了一些消极的影响。
    今天，戏曲也随着生产和各项文化工作的大跃进，而有很大的发展。去年文化部召开戏曲表现现代生活座谈会以后，戏曲在表现现代生活方面作出了很大的成绩。时代向戏曲提出的任务是光荣而艰巨的。从事戏曲音乐工作的同志应该怎样进一步地努力呢？怎样避免重复过去的错误呢？这牵涉到一些认识问题和做法问题，探讨这些问题对工作是有好处的。
              戏曲音乐的规律
    戏曲有悠久的历史，戏曲音乐在发展中形成了特有的风格和规律，这些足以使它与欧洲歌剧或创作的新歌剧区别开来。
    从它与传统音乐的联系方面看，戏曲音乐广泛地吸取了民族音乐的精华。南北曲形成时，就吸取了从汉代百戏到唐宋民歌、说唱、歌舞音乐。以后戏曲音乐不断发展，但从未中断与传统音乐和民间音乐的联系，并互有影响。因此，戏曲音乐中各种表现手法和手段，诸如曲牌、唱腔、唱法、锣鼓、丝竹等是非常丰富而有特色的。
    从它在戏曲舞台上的作用和地位看，戏曲音乐作为综合艺术的一个有机部分，与其他部分保持着谐调的关系。它从未被强调到唯一的或为主的地位。在整个演出中，凡是它所擅长胜任的地方，它作充分的发挥；凡是它不擅长胜任的地方，它便退居次位或让位给别的艺术手段来表现。不消说，这并不意味着降低音乐的重要性，相反，这常常使音乐的作用更加突出，并形成了特有的表现手法。
    戏曲音乐的表现手法基本上有两类，一类主要是从旋律的因素发展的，另一类主要是从节奏的因素发展的。从旋律的因素发展的，包括集句、集曲、犯腔、犯调等手法，直到形成一整套充分发挥各种不同曲调的对比、呼应、排比、衬托作用的结构原则。我国最古老的剧种以及今天许多地方小戏的音乐都是以这原则构成的。从节奏的因素发展的，主要是根据一个基本的曲调，作速度、节拍、节奏上的种种变化，通常可以归纳在慢板（一板三眼）、中板（一板一眼）、快板（有板无眼）、散板（无板无眼或紧打慢唱）这四种板类中，但实际上的变化是无穷的。
  这种手法在古代歌舞的音乐中就已运用，但成为戏曲的一种主要表现手法并得到充分发展似乎是从梆子戏开始。这种手法因为富于戏剧性的表现和深刻的内心描写，所以在近代戏曲中被更广泛地采用着。
    这两种手法不是对立的，事实上任何剧种很少单纯采取一种手法，而多是按照本剧种的传统条件和表现上的需要，以一种为主，一种为辅，或者兼采并用。
    这些传统的表现手法当然也有不足之处，特别是在表现现代生活和外来音乐文化的影响下，它是需要进一步发展的。欧洲音乐结构中的许多原则（如奏鸣的原则）以及和声、复调、交响化等手法，是值得参考吸取的。不消说，这是个很困难的工作，因为，要吸取外来的成分不仅要对外来的东西有深刻的而不是皮毛的理解，同时，更重要的是对传统的东西也要有正确的认识。尽管戏曲音乐在长久的历史时期卓越地完成了它的任务，但它的规律未被很好地总结过，今天我们对它无论从美学的或者技术的方面体会也还不深，认识也还不够。在这种情况下，一旦我们想吸收外来的东西，就往往把传统的东西丢掉了。
      戏曲音乐的现实主义和浪漫主义
    在研究和运用戏曲音乐的规律中，有一种看法认为，戏曲音乐的传统手法是把不同的人物安上同一的曲调，不能够像欧洲歌剧的主导动机发展方法那样准确地刻划人物形象，因此它是违反现实主义创作方法的。
    这种看法值得商榷。
   现实主义的创作方法主要表现在对生活揭露的真实与否和深度如何，而不在于采用什么手段和手法。现实主义当然需要高度的表现技巧，但这还是要建立在生活真实性的基础上的。
    从我们所获得的材料来看，差不多所有戏曲音乐的基本曲调都是来源自民间，其中有很多是群众在劳动时所唱的号子，也有很多是当地最流行的民歌、舞曲。这些曲调是群众在世世代代的生活斗争中集体创造的，经过千锤百炼，生动感人，在表达群众的思想情感方面，应该说是抓住了本质的东西，是深刻的，典型的。至于说这些曲调不能明确表达出某一具体事物的形象，这倒是音乐艺术本身的特点，它不能像语言艺术或造型艺术那样精确地描写事物的具体形象。音乐是感情的语言，它主要是通过描写人物的内心感情变化来反映现实。它也具有描写客观事物的能力（即所谓造型性），但这不是它最擅长的。
    从这方面来看戏曲音乐的创作方法，就能够了解它是符合现实主义的精神的。这特别表现在艺人的创造中。他们在创造一个人物时，总是设身处地揣摩其精神状态，然后从其身分、性格、语言、语调、感情的节奏等方面作精心的刻划，因此非常真实动人。像梅兰芳先生在“贵妃醉酒”、“宇宙锋”等剧中所创造的人物形象，从音乐（主要人物的唱腔）方面来看，也是具有现实主义精神的。
    几百年以来，无数前辈艺人给我们留下了丰富的音乐遗产，这些优秀的唱腔和曲牌世世代代感动着观众，鼓舞他们生活斗争的热情，启发他们美好的生活理想，这些遗产值得我们好好地研究、学习，不能因为它不符合我们从欧洲音乐中所获得的一些规律和技巧的概念，而将它否定。戏曲中优秀的现实主义传统常常是与浪漫主义相结合的，在音乐上也是这样。这种结合，不仅表现在从内容上来说写出了理想，像“梁山伯与祝英台”的化蝶等；同时在表现手法上更激情，更热烈，使得是非更分明，爱憎更强烈，使得人物形象更突出，更理想，更典型。从这方面来看，不仅“化蝶”的音乐具有浪漫主义气氛，就是“楼台会”、“哭坟”（特别是梆子戏中表现的这一场）的音乐也是现实主义与浪漫主义结合的。可以说戏曲中优秀的唱腔，没有不是多少具有浪漫主义精神的，特别是因为音乐本身就是一种感情的语言，没有充沛的感情，没有激奋的热情，是根本无法创造出激动人心的腔调来的。反对粗暴，也反对保守现在看来，问题的关键在对于传统的认识。传统本来有积极的一面，也有消极的一面，对前者估计不足，只看到后者，在工作中就会形成粗暴；反之就会保守。粗暴也罢，保守也罢，最后都会导致传统的死亡。
    对传统估计不足，常常和盲目崇拜西洋的教条主义思想联系在一起，结果就想以创作新歌剧的办法来进行戏曲改革。有些同志认为主要问题不在这里，而在于过去某些方针不明确，如说“新戏曲”就是“新歌剧”之类。这其实是一种误解。过去说新戏曲也是一种新歌剧，是针对那种只承认歌剧，不承认戏曲，或者以歌剧为高，以戏曲为低的思想，从广泛的美学意义上提出我们的戏曲也就是我们的民族歌剧的一种。这种提法没有什么错误。当然，这并不意味着要在日常工作中把歌剧与戏曲混同起来，把歌剧团体与戏曲团体混同起来。相反地，过去的方针很明确，那便是“百花齐放”，那便是尊重传统，学习传统，尊重艺人，依靠艺人，充分发挥本剧种的特点，避免与其他剧种的混淆，特别要避免以创作新歌剧的办法代替戏曲改革。可见从政策方针上我们找不到粗暴的根源，这根源还是来自盲目崇拜西洋的教条主义。
    同时，那种故步自封的保守主义也是我们要反对的。保守主义者只看到了传统的这一面，丢开了另一面。在他们看来，传统是万能的，不需要革新和发展，一切都最好按照几十年前的老样子不要动。保守主义者打着维护传统和尊重群众欣赏习惯的旗号，但实际上真正懂得传统也懂得生活的艺人和广大群众是并不保守的，他们既要传统，也要革新。
    保守主义有形形色色的表现。
    比如，在唱腔上，他们反对任何外来因素，只要有一个音符、一个音节，离开了本剧种的古老传统，他们就要反对，就认为这是粗暴。
    在乐队上，他们反对增加乐器，不仅西洋乐器绝对加不得，就是民族乐器，也只能限于本剧种已有的几件，不能增加，增加了又是破坏传统。如果这一剧种除了打击乐器以外再没有其他乐器，他们就主张永远用打击乐器伴奏下去，以保持“风格”。如果有人企图作增加旋律性乐器的试验，他们也要反对。有些地方为了限制乐队的发展，就将乐池填平，使乐队还是回到台上去。
    在声乐上，他们也认为传统的东西只有精华没有糟粕，因此像“炸音”“阴阳嗓”……之类只准说好，不准怀疑，反对任何革新的试验，反对除此以外的第二种可能的做法。
    当然，这倒不是说对任何革新不能提出异议，否则便是保守。革新总是会有缺点的，并且常常需要进行一些有计划的试验。我们反对粗暴，反对盲目革新，但对于按照戏曲发展的规律所进行的真正革新和试验，应该给以关怀、赞助，而不要按照一种主观标准给革新订下一些清规戒律。戏曲发展的历史是戏曲革新的最好的见证人。所有的历史都说明戏曲是在不断反映新的生活内容的要求下，大胆吸收，勇敢创造而发展起来的。如果说戏曲在现有的表现工具和方法、技术上不能再吸收、再发展了，那么试问现有的这一切又是从哪里来的呢？戏曲本身的历史否定了保守主义，保守派是站不住脚的。
    戏曲音乐工作要走群众路线
    戏曲的远景一片光明。
    前几年还有人怀疑，戏曲能不能进入社会主义社会，能不能为社会主义服务，地方戏会不会被消灭或合并……这些已由事实作了回答。
    今后戏曲还将作为一种最富有群众性的艺术进入共产主义社会，并且随着人民文化生活的提高而不断发展，在题材内容上更宽广，在表现形式上更丰富，更精美。
    关于戏曲艺术的群众性这一点，在我们过去的工作特别是音乐工作中，对它估计不足。群众对戏曲爱好的程度，他们的审美观点，以及他们不仅要求能够欣赏也要求自己能唱能演……这些我们缺少深切的体会，因之常常采用一般音乐作品的创作方法，由作曲家写，演员唱，观众听。这种方法用在戏曲音乐工作上往往要失败的。
    戏曲音乐的工作方法，从它的群众性这方面的意义来讲，也许可以说是一种“小土群”的方法。这就是说，要小改，要在传统基础上发展，要适应广大群众要求，甚至需要群众也参加创作。
    这自然不是说作曲家在戏曲音乐工作上绝对不能作曲；作曲常常是需要的，但它不能成为一种主要的方式。而且，如果我们把作曲这个概念不是理解得那么狭窄的话，对传统唱腔作局部的、不十分大的发展，也是一种作曲。通常这种创作总是采取集体的方式来完成，而不是以个人的方式来完成的。这就是说，由演员、专业音乐工作者、琴师、以至导演等参加共同设计、研究，并且在群众中反复考验、修正，这是戏曲音乐工作的一种主要的方法。
    这样会不会降低了专业音乐工作者的作用，会不会影响他们的积极性呢？专业音乐工作者只要从戏曲音乐的实际出发，他的积极性是大大可以发挥的，像对传统优秀唱腔的创作方法的钻研就需要花很大的功夫。这一点即令今天一些有创造才能的演员，他们也是感性的知识和经验多，而缺少理性的概括，因此不能更快地提高创作水平。这一部分工作是需要专业音乐工作者很快地补充起来的。此外，生活体验和思想修养的提高，也是非常重要的任务，否则就很难参加这种集体创作并在创作中起作用。
    有些同志以为，既然戏曲音乐工作要走群众路线，既然创作中又要依靠艺人，那末专业音乐工作者也就可有可无了。这显然是不对的。当然，今天并不需要在全国每一个戏曲剧团都要配备专业音乐干部，但一些重点的国营剧团，特别是在过去已有基础的地方，专业的音乐干部还是需要的。许多演员从来就没有怀疑过专业音乐干部的作用，他们是十分需要这样一些合作者的。
    总之，要调动一切积极力量；要继承传统，也要勇于革新；要掌握它的规律，也要看到它的明天；这样才能使戏曲音乐更快地向前发展。
