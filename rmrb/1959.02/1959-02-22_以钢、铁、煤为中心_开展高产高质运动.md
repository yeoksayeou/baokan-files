Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, February 21st: The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party announced at a telephone conference of secretaries of prefectural and municipal Party committees on the 16th that the province would launch a high-yield and high-quality campaign month centered on steel, iron, and coal in March. It called on leading cadres to personally take charge, fully mobilize the masses, launch a vigorous technical revolution, carry out mass movements on a grand scale, focus on production management, engage in appraisal and competition in a big way, and plant high-yield and high-quality red flags, to raise the province's steel, iron, and coal production to a new level.

The meeting considered that the overall production situation of steel, iron, and coal in the province had been good for more than a month this year. As of February 12, the province produced 49,000 tons of iron, mined 1,750,000 tons of coal, and refined 139,500 tons of coke. The output of steel and steel products also increased significantly. The total volume of newly built small blast furnaces was more than 2,000 cubic meters. Around the Spring Festival, more than 300 cadres in the province went deep into key areas to inspect production and solve many problems, and a leap forward situation began to appear in production.

The meeting pointed out that the province's steel, iron, and coal production tasks this year are very heavy, and doing a good job in the first quarter is the key to striving for the initiative in the work for the whole year. The meeting called on all prefectural, county, and municipal Party committees, and all iron and mining plants to actively prepare from now on to welcome the "High-Yield and High-Quality Campaign Month" in March. In February, it is necessary to ensure that the targets set by the Provincial Party Committee, such as a daily output of 315 tons of steel and 1,737 tons of iron, are reached and exceeded.

The meeting proposed that during the "High-Yield and High-Quality Campaign Month," the average daily iron output in the province should reach 2,000-2,500 tons, and the iron produced should be basically qualified iron (i.e., capable of steelmaking and machine casting); the average daily steel output should reach about 500 tons; each steelmaking unit's converter should produce about 30 furnaces of steel per day, and each iron melting furnace should produce about 35 furnaces per day; the average daily coal output should reach about 60,000 tons, and the daily coke refining should reach about 7,330 tons. At the same time, it called on all localities to vigorously promote the use of white coal for iron smelting in blast furnaces, indigenous methods of coal washing, and the construction of simple coke ovens to fight for high-yield and high-quality coal and coke.

In order to successfully complete the above tasks, the meeting proposed that it is necessary to fully mobilize the vast number of cadres and the masses, carry out mass movements centered on the technical revolution, engage in competition on a grand scale, focus on production management, and plant high-yield and high-quality red flags to work vigorously; leading cadres should go deep down, engage in experimental plots, and drive the overall situation; production and capital construction should be properly arranged; steel, iron, coal, and transportation should be closely linked, one link after another; and ore and raw material fuel should be vigorously stored. There should be at least one month's worth of reserves before the rainy season to ensure the normal production of blast furnaces; mechanical plants responsible for supporting tasks should seize the production of electrical equipment and accessories such as cranes and rollers, and quickly assemble the already manufactured steelmaking converters and rolling mills. Machinery plants in various counties and cities should also actively produce small hardware and other parts to help iron plants complete the installation of blast furnace equipment.

    以钢、铁、煤为中心
    开展高产高质运动
    湖南
    据新华社长沙21日电　中共湖南省委在16日召开的地委、市委工业书记电话会议上宣布，全省在3月份开展一个以钢、铁、煤为中心的高产高质运动月；要求领导干部亲自上马，充分发动群众，大闹技术革命，大搞群众运动，大抓生产管理，大搞评比竞赛，大插高产高质红旗，把全省钢、铁、煤的生产提高到一个新的水平。
    会议认为，今年一个多月来，全省钢、铁、煤的总的生产情况是好的。到2月12日止，全省产铁四万九千吨，采煤一百七十五万吨，炼焦十三万九千五百吨，钢和钢材的产量也有很大增长。新建成的小高炉容积共有二千多立方公尺。春节前后，全省有三百多名干部深入重点检查生产，解决了不少问题，生产上开始出现跃进局面。
    会议指出：今年全省钢、铁、煤的生产任务十分繁重，第一季度抓得好，是争取全年工作主动的关键。会议要求各地委、县委、市委，各铁厂矿山，从现在起积极作好准备，迎接3月份“高产高质运动月”。在2月份内，要保证达到和超额完成省委提出的日产钢三百一十五吨，日产铁一千七百三十七吨等指标。
    会议提出：全省在“高产高质运动月”中，日产生铁平均要达到二千——二千五百吨，所产生铁基本上都是合格铁（即能炼钢，能铸造机器）；日产钢平均达到五百吨左右；各炼钢单位的转炉每日炼钢要达到三十炉左右，化铁炉每日炼三十五炉左右；日产煤平均达到六万吨左右，日炼焦达到七千三百三十吨左右。同时，要求各地大力推广高炉白煤炼铁，土法洗煤，大搞简易炼焦炉，为煤、焦高产高质而战。
    为了胜利完成上述任务，会议提出：要充分发动广大干部和群众，开展以技术革命为中心的群众运动，大搞竞赛，大抓生产管理，大插高产高质红旗，轰轰烈烈地干；领导干部要深入下去，搞试验田，带动全面；要妥善安排生产和基本建设；要使钢、铁、煤、运输四个方面紧密衔接，一环套一环；要大力储备矿石和原料燃料。雨季以前至少有一个月的储备量，以保证高炉正常生产；担负配套任务的各机械厂要抓紧生产电器设备和吊车、轧辊等配件，迅速把已经制成的炼钢转炉、轧钢机配起套来。各县、市机械厂也要积极生产小五金等零件，帮助铁厂完成高炉设备安装工作。
