Launch a Revolutionary Emulation Campaign to Fight for a Great Agricultural Harvest

Hubei's Twenty-Four Counties Form Five Emulation Zones, Competing on Output, Income, Fulfillment of Procurement Tasks, and the Mass Line; Jiangxi's Fuzhou Prefecture Strives for Grain Yields of 2,000 Jin Per Mu and Cotton Yields of 100 Jin, with Over Eighty Counties Across the Province Participating in a Heated Emulation

(Our Newspaper, Wuhan, 1st Dispatch) To strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, Hubei Province has launched an unprecedented socialist emulation campaign.

The socialist emulation campaign in Hubei Province takes various forms, including leagues and head-to-head competitions, with people displaying soaring morale and spirited enthusiasm. To date, twenty-four counties across the province have joined the league, divided into five competition zones through consultation. The specific content of the competition is: (1) comparing total output, unit area output, and the rate of increase in grain and cotton; (2) comparing total income and the growth rate of per capita income; (3) comparing the fulfillment of state procurement tasks and financial tasks; (4) comparing the working methods of the mass line. Based on last year's experience, these counties have also decided to organize two or three rounds of visits and evaluations, with each competition zone as a unit. At the same time, small-scale visits and studies are frequently organized between counties in the competition zone, learning from each other's strengths and continuously inspiring enthusiasm, with the winning county selected at the end of the year.

At the same time, Xiaogan County, one of the nation's famous high-yield grain counties, challenged all counties in the province. They proposed that this year's total grain output should strive to reach 3 billion jin or more, an increase of 1.2 billion jin over last year; the unit area output should reach 5,000 jin; and the cotton yield per mu should be 1,000 jin of ginned cotton. As a result, a massive competition between counties and communes has been launched throughout the province. Fourteen counties (cities) and one hundred and fifty-six communes in Xiangyang Prefecture have all participated in the competition. Each county has been divided into three or four war zones, and the entire prefecture has been divided into forty-nine war zones. Some counties are competing on multiple fronts. Yicheng County is competing with both Nanzhang and Guanghua. Guanghua County proposed: "Hard work for three years, the second year requires even more ingenuity, learn from Macheng and Gucheng, catch up with Jianghan in one, two, three years." Calculated on a per capita basis, in 1959 they aim to achieve: 3,000 jin of grain, 1,000 jin of ginned cotton, 100 jin of oil, 1,000 yuan of money per person; 100 jin of fish, 1,000 jin of vegetables, and one and a half pigs. Each county has several competitors. Each commune is also looking for competitors. Pangong and Wangzhai communes in Xiangfan City challenged the suburban communes of Wuhan, Huangshi, Shashi, Yichang and other cities, and formulated specific measures to achieve their plans. Dayuan in Shishou County and Babao in Songzi County are both well-known cotton-producing areas. After the people's communes in the two places proposed a competition, the enthusiasm of the cadres and the masses was even greater, and they all expressed that they would achieve greater results in cotton production this year.

(Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 1st Dispatch) Jiangxi Province has launched a heated mass competition movement centered on achieving a greater leap forward in 1959. From the end of December last year to the present, the six prefectures and over eighty counties in the province have all issued letters of challenge and submitted acceptance forms, jointly proposing: On the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, continue to work hard, work especially hard, work fiercely, work painstakingly, work practically, and work skillfully, fight hard in 1959, the crucial year of the three-year hard struggle, and ensure the realization of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.

The competition was first initiated by Fuzhou Prefecture. The prefecture's total grain output reached 3.5 billion jin in 1958, becoming the first thousand-jin prefecture in the province, with an average of 3,000 jin of grain per rural person. This year, their proposed leap forward targets are: strive for a total grain output of 5.2 billion jin, a yield of 2,000 jin per mu, and an average of 4,000 jin of grain per rural person; expand the cotton field area from 100,000 mu last year to 300,000 mu, with a yield of 100 jin per mu. In their letter of challenge, they said: We have achieved a great victory in 1958, but we will never be complacent or arrogant. We will always maintain vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm, leap again and again, and always be promoters of socialist and communist construction. Gannan Administrative Region immediately responded and challenged Ji'an Prefecture. Shangrao, Jiujiang and other prefectures also successively proposed to respond to the challenge. The competition surge quickly spread to all counties in the province.

Nankang County, whose unit area grain yield exceeded 800 jin last year, but lost to Gan County in the competition, first challenged Gan County, as well as Xinfeng, Suichuan, and other counties this year. They are determined to increase the total output of grain and oil crops by more than two times, and the total output of cotton by more than seven times in 1959. Their slogan is: Learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, learn from each other's strengths and leap forward together. Yongxiu County in Jiujiang Prefecture challenged its neighboring counties of Xingzi, Wuning, and Xinjian. They loudly proposed: Enthusiasm breaks through the sky, a major battle in the crucial year. Pengze County, known for its cotton production and achieving a hundred-jin ginned cotton county in last year's great leap forward, proposed to plant 100,000 mu of cotton and yield 200 jin per mu in 1959, challenging Jiujiang and Chongren counties, which are also major cotton-producing areas, determined to achieve 100,000 mu of double-hundred jin and win the championship in the province.

In order to achieve a greater leap forward in 1959, and strive to be the best in the competition, each prefecture and county, after discussion by the broad masses, has proposed feasible measures, and immediately turned these measures into practical actions. After initiating the competition, Fuzhou Prefecture immediately convened a meeting of the first secretaries of county and commune party committees, and discussed in detail the measures to achieve the great leap forward, determining that the agricultural aspects of the first quarter would focus on fertilizer, water conservancy, field management and other tasks. After the meeting, the whole region immediately launched a heated manure accumulation campaign. They were required to accumulate 500 loads of fertilizer for each mu of land. After Nankang County in the Gannan Administrative Region proposed the competition, each people's commune separately discussed and revised this year's leap forward plan, formulated specific measures for each commune, and then each commune inspected the current preparatory work for farming. The inspection revealed that fertilizer was the weakest link in achieving the competition target of doubling grain production. In response, the county immediately organized a 150,000-strong army to launch a concentrated manure accumulation campaign. Starting on January 16, more than 100 million loads of various fertilizers were accumulated within a week. All members of the Liantang Commune in the county accumulated manure despite the drizzle and frost, accumulating 544 loads of fertilizer for each mu of land in the commune within a week, an increase of three times compared with last year. The members sang heroically: The morning is white with ice and frost, every member is full of enthusiasm; more than a thousand loads of fertilizer are applied per mu, and a thousand jin of grain must be harvested per mu. Hukou County, which challenged Duchang and Pengze counties with a competition target of 300 jin of rapeseed per mu, has recently taken measures to strengthen field management of the county's 69,000 mu of rapeseed fields. The county has specially organized an army of more than 20,000 people for rapeseed field management, carrying out a concentrated campaign for five days, applying fertilizer and weeding twice to 69,000 mu of rapeseed, and covering them with cow dung and thatch to prevent rain and frost.

Now, the socialist emulation movement in Jiangxi Province to achieve a greater leap forward in 1959 is developing in a wider and more in-depth direction. Many people's communes and people's communes, production teams and production teams have launched fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing competitions, field management competitions, and sideline production competitions. The competition has aroused greater revolutionary enthusiasm among the masses and promoted the development of various productions, especially the current manure accumulation and manufacturing campaign. According to statistics, the various fertilizers that have been accumulated now average more than 220 loads per mu.

    英雄儿女永做促进派　奋勇向前年年大跃进
    掀起革命大竞赛为农业大丰收而战
    湖北二十四个县组成五个竞赛区，比产量、比收入、比完成征购任务、比群众路线  江西抚州专区力争亩产粮食二千斤、棉花一百斤，全省八十多县竞赛热火朝天
    本报武汉1日电　为争取1959年实现更大、更好、更全面的跃进，湖北省掀起了空前规模的社会主义大竞赛。
    湖北省的社会主义大竞赛，形式多种多样，有联赛，有对赛，人们意志昂扬，精神奋发。到目前，全省参加联赛的已有二十四个县，这些县经过协商划分了五个竞赛区，竞赛的具体内容是：（一）比总产量、比单位面积产量及粮棉增产幅度；（二）比总收入、比每人平均收入的增长幅度；（三）比完成国家征购任务和财政任务；（四）比群众路线的工作方法。根据去年的经验，这些县并确定以竞赛区为单位，组织两、三次参观评比。同时，竞赛区各县之间，经常组织小型的参观学习，互相取长补短，不断地鼓舞干劲，年终评选优胜县。
    与此同时，全国著名的粮食高产县之一的孝感县，向全省各县挑战。他们提出今年粮食总产量争取达到三十亿斤或更多一些，比去年增产十二亿斤；单位面积产量要达到五千斤；棉花亩产籽棉一千斤。于是，全省开展起声势浩大的县与县、公社与公社之间的竞赛。襄阳专区十四个县（市）、一百五十六个公社，都参加了竞赛。每个县都划分了三、四个战区，全专区划分了四十九个战区，有的县左右开弓，前后竞赛。宜城县既同南漳，又同光化竞赛。光化县提出：“苦干三年第二年，苦干更需加巧干，学习麻城和谷城，一二三年赶江汉”，按人口平均计算，1959年要求达到：每人三千斤粮、千斤籽棉、百斤油料、千元钱；百斤鱼、千斤菜，还有生猪一头半。每个县都有几个竞赛对手。各公社也各找竞赛对手，襄樊市庞公、王寨公社向武汉、黄石、沙市、宜昌等市郊区公社提出挑战，并订出了实现规划的各项具体措施。石首县的大垸和松滋县的八宝垸，都是出名的产棉区，两地的人民公社提出竞赛后，干部和群众的干劲更大，都表示要在今年棉花生产上，取得更大的成绩。
    本报南昌1日电　江西全省掀起了热火朝天的以实现1959年更大跃进为中心内容的群众竞赛运动。从去年12月底到目前，全省六个专区、八十多个县都相互下了挑战书，递了应战表，共同提出：在1958年伟大跃进的基础上继续大干、特干、猛干、苦干、实干、巧干，大战1959年这个苦战三年的关键年，保证实现更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
    竞赛首先由抚州专区发起。这个专区1958年粮食总产量达到三十五亿斤，成为全省第一个千斤专区，按农村人口平均计算，每人有粮达到三千斤；今年他们提出的跃进指标是：力争粮食总产量达到五十二亿斤、亩产达到二千斤、农村每人平均有粮四千斤；棉田面积由去年十万亩扩大到三十万亩，每亩达到一百斤。他们在挑战书中说：1958年我们取得了伟大的胜利，但决不自满骄傲，我们始终保持旺盛的革命干劲，一跃再跃，永远做社会主义和共产主义建设的促进派。赣南行政区立即应战，并向吉安专区挑战。上饶、九江等专区亦相继提出应战挑战。竞赛热潮迅速遍及全省各县。
    去年粮食单位面积产量跨过八百斤，但是在竞赛中输给赣县的南康县，今年首先向赣县，以及信丰、遂川等县提出挑战，他们决心在1959年使全县粮食和油料总产量都增长两倍以上，棉花总产量增长七倍以上。他们的口号是：学先进、赶先进、取长补短齐跃进，九江专区的永修县向他的邻县星子、武宁、新建提出了挑战，他们响亮地提出：干劲冲破天，大战关键年。以产棉著称、并在去年大跃进中实现了百斤皮棉县的彭泽县，提出在1959年植棉十万亩，亩产二百斤，向也是盛产棉花的九江、崇仁两县挑战，决心实现十万亩双百斤，在全省内夺取冠军。
    为了实现1959年更大跃进，在竞赛中力争上游，各专区、县经过广大群众讨论，提出了切实可行的措施，并且立即把这些措施变为实际行动。抚州专区发起竞赛后立即召开了县委、公社党委第一书记会议，详细讨论了实现大跃进的措施，确定第一季度农业方面着重抓肥料、水利、田间管理等几项工作。会后，全区马上掀起了一个热火朝天的积肥运动。要求为每亩田积造肥料五百担。赣南行政区南康县提出竞赛后，各人民公社分别讨论修订了今年的跃进计划，拟定了各个社的具体措施，然后各社对当前的备耕工作进行了检查。从检查中发现，要实现粮食增长两倍的竞赛指标，肥料是个最薄弱的环节，针对这种情况，全县马上组织起了十五万大军突击积肥，从1月16日开始，一个星期之内便突击积造各种肥料上亿担。该县莲塘公社全体社员冒细雨、破冰霜积肥，一个星期之内为全社的每亩土地积了五百四十四担肥料，比去年增加三倍；社员们雄赳赳地唱道：早晨冰霜白茫茫，社员个个干劲强；每亩下肥超千担，每亩要打千斤粮。以亩产油菜籽三百斤为竞赛条件向都昌、彭泽两县挑战的湖口县，最近采取措施加强了全县六万九千多亩油菜田的田间管理，全县专门组织了二万多人的油菜田间管理大军，突击了五天，对六万九千亩油菜普遍施了两次肥，锄了两次草，并盖上了牛栏草和茅草，防淋防冻。
    现在，江西省内为实现1959年更大跃进的社会主义竞赛运动正在向更广泛更深入的方面开展，许多人民公社与人民公社、生产队与生产队之间掀起了积肥造肥竞赛、田间管理竞赛，副业生产竞赛。竞赛激起了群众更大的革命干劲，促进了各项生产、尤其是当前积肥造肥运动的开展，据统计，现在全省已积造的各种肥料平均每亩可达到二百二十多担。
