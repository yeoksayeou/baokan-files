    Good, Better, Best!
    Yi Huai
    Opening recent newspapers, one can see many news items like the improvement of work style of cadres in Hepu County. In areas where collectivization has been completed, strict inspections of the work style of cadres have been carried out in most places. The results of the inspections prove that our grassroots comrades can withstand the fiery tests of mass movements. The situation in many places is similar to that of Hepu County. Last year, not only did the output of grain and cotton double, but the working methods and work style of cadres were also greatly improved. At present, these comrades are not only galloping ahead to ensure the realization of the production increase targets proposed by the Party and striving for even greater continuous leaps forward; they are also striving for perfection in their working methods and work style, aiming to be even better this year than last year. This spirit of continuous improvement in leadership is one of the most reliable guarantees of continuous leaps forward.
    No matter how great the achievements and how good the experience, it does not mean that there are no shortcomings, let alone that it is perfect. Moreover, what seems relatively perfect today will seem imperfect tomorrow. Good can only be relative, not absolute. Good is also forever endless. Having good, we must strive for better; having better, we must strive for even better. This is the spirit of continuous revolution advocated by our Party. Treating achievements with this spirit, and seeing both the achievements and the shortcomings and defects, we can always maintain a clear and calm mind, and no matter how great the achievements or how much praise we hear, we will not be satisfied or stop. Soaring drive, full enthusiasm, coupled with such a clear and calm mind, can become a true force for progress. Conversely, if we absolutize achievements, fail to see any defects or shortcomings, and fail to set ourselves more distant, higher, and greater goals, we will sit there admiring the achievements, and our drive will easily be insufficient.
    We cannot absolutize achievements, and even less can we absolutize shortcomings. Our shortcomings often accompany achievements and are problems that arise in the process of development and have not yet been resolved. Therefore, they can never overshadow the dazzling brilliance of achievements. However, people's thinking sometimes becomes absolutized. When looking at shortcomings, they unconsciously exaggerate them and underestimate achievements. Exaggerating shortcomings and failing to see achievements will make people lose their way and lose confidence in continuing to move forward. People like to say to advance on the crest of victory. Why? Precisely because continuing to move forward after victory gives us even more momentum. Even correcting shortcomings and overcoming difficulties cannot be separated from promoting achievements. Only by fully promoting achievements can people have both the means and the confidence to face shortcomings and difficulties, instead of being helpless and losing confidence.
    Let us carry this spirit of both recognizing the good and striving for better into all our work, so that we can learn to treat achievements and shortcomings with a dialectical attitude and always be energetic and forge ahead.

    好，更好！
    易槐
    打开最近的报纸，可以看到很多像合浦县改进干部作风的新闻。已经整社的地方，大都对干部作风进行了严格的检查。检查结果证明，我们的基层工作同志是能经得起群众运动烈火的考验的。许多地方的情况都同合浦县类似，去年一年，不但粮食、棉花的产量翻了番，干部的工作方法和工作作风也有了很大改进。目前，这些同志不但在保证实现党提出的增产指标上，纵马飞奔，争取更大幅度的连续跃进；在工作方法工作作风方面，同样精益求精，力争今年比去年更好。这种不断改进领导的精神，是不断跃进的最可靠的保证之一。
    工作成绩再大，经验再好，并不等于就没有缺点，更不一定就尽善尽美。而且，今天看来是比较完美的东西，到了明天就又显得不够完美了。好，只能是相对的而不是绝对的。好，也永远是无止境的。有了好，还要更好；更好了，还要再好。这就是我们党所提倡的不断革命精神。用这种精神对待成绩，在看到成绩的同时，也看到不足和缺陷之处，就可以使我们永远保持清醒、冷静的头脑，不管成绩多大，听到的赞扬多少，也不会满足，不会停顿。冲天的干劲，饱满的热情，加上这样的清醒冷静的头脑，就能成为真正的促进派。相反的，如果把成绩绝对化了，看不到还有什么缺陷和不足之处，不给自己树立起更远更高更大的目标，就会坐在那里欣赏成绩，干劲反到容易不足。
    不能把成绩绝对化，更不能把缺点绝对化，我们的缺点常是伴随成绩而来，是事物发展过程中出现的还没有来得及解决的问题。因此，它决不可能遮盖住成绩的耀眼光辉。但是，人们的思想有时候却会绝对化，看缺点的时候不自觉地会把缺点夸大，会对成绩估计不足。夸大缺点，看不到成绩，就会使人迷失方向，丧失继续前进的信心。人们爱说乘胜前进。为什么？正是因为胜利之后继续前进，劲头就会更足。就是纠正缺点克服困难，同样也离不了发扬成绩。只有充分发扬成绩，才能使人在缺点和困难面前既有办法，又有信心，而不是束手无策，丧失信心。
    让我们把这种既认识到好，又力求更好的精神，贯串在我们的一切工作中间，使我们学会用辩证的态度对待成绩和缺点，永远朝气勃勃勇往直前。
