New Teacher-Student Relationships Inspire Us to Move Forward
Professors of the History Department, Peking University: Deng Guangming, Qi Sihe, Shao Xunzheng, Zhang Zhilian

During this period, in the process of teachers and students working together on teaching under the leadership of the Party, we have received another profound education. Our experiences are mainly focused on the new teacher-student relationship. Here, we will write down some of our experiences and thoughts on the teacher-student relationship.

(I)
The domestic and international situation over the past year has inspired us, the soaring enthusiasm of the workers and peasants has educated us, the Two-Anti campaign has enhanced our political and ideological understanding, and the criticism of academic thought has improved our ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect viewpoints. At the beginning of this academic year, we, like some other teachers, held great enthusiasm and strived to improve the quality of teaching. However, the students' response was still not satisfactory, believing that there was not much change in the teaching content and methods.

Where exactly is the problem? In today's establishment of a new teacher-student relationship, the problem is easily understood. This lies in the fact that, on the one hand, we did not understand that teaching and learning are a unity of opposites, and we did not understand the principle of understanding and relying on the masses in teaching work; on the other hand, although we have received a lot of education in the movements of the past year, our theoretical level has not improved significantly, and the combination of theory and materials in teaching has not been done well for a while, so the changes in teaching content are always very limited. In addition, the reform of other teaching links at that time had not yet caught up, so the students' unsatisfactory response was natural. Today, some of us use "When the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there is no way out, there is another village with bright willows and blooming flowers" to describe the change in our mood, which is very appropriate. But it should also be added that it is not easy to understand this very basic principle and discover a new realm until you reach the point where the mountains and rivers are exhausted.

In fact, the feeling of "exhausted mountains and rivers" did not come suddenly in a day or two. Over the past year or so, the struggle between the two lines in politics and ideology has made everyone more clearly aware of themselves. Those who originally felt that they had made some progress in politics saw that they were still in the middle, and those who originally felt that they had some academic capital saw that they were still far from enough. At the same time, those who used to be attached to "private plots" and believed that "only with private plots can they give full play to their strengths" now realize that "only by putting their energy completely into the unified arrangement of the Party can they make a real contribution to socialism." Therefore, striving for establishment after great destruction is the idea shared by everyone. We have all resolutely abandoned the old bourgeois road, but we are still unfamiliar with the new path, and there are still many difficulties in walking it. First of all, although we admit that destruction and establishment are combined, we feel that we cannot establish it for a while. At the beginning of this academic year, when faced with new teaching tasks, we could not help but feel empty and hesitant to some extent. For example, one of us who was teaching the history of the Sui and Tang Dynasties used Mr. Chen Yinque's arguments in many places in the past, such as the rulers of the Sui and Tang Dynasties took the "Guanlong Group" as the backbone, and the Niu-Li factional struggle was due to the different class basis of the two parties. These erroneous idealistic viewpoints must now be abandoned, but he could not come up with anything new for a while. Later, the method of collective lesson preparation in the teaching and research section was adopted to break through this difficult barrier. However, it is not easy to change the teaching content in a short period of time, which is always a burden on our minds. On the other hand, there is not enough mutual understanding between teachers and students, especially teachers know very little about students' thoughts and feelings and their difficulties and requirements in learning. Both teachers and students have great enthusiasm, but they cannot use their strength. Therefore, many opinions from students are a kind of urging and criticism to the teachers, but they are also a reflection of the fact that teaching, scientific research and productive labor have not been well combined and a new teacher-student relationship has not been established. At that time, we only wanted to "teach" well, and did not really consider how students should "learn" well, which should be said to be a key to the problem.

(II)
Just at this time, the Party organization seized the key to the problem and quickly opened up the situation. The Party organization called on us to put down our airs, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and become one with the students. They said to us that this is not a very simple matter. Some of us have never been to student dormitories, and we have no specific understanding of how to put down our airs and how to become one with the students. But since the old path is not working, let's follow the path indicated by the Party. In this way, we went to the students. After arriving among the students, a warm and enthusiastic atmosphere immediately enveloped us. We realized how eagerly the students expected the teachers to deeply understand their feelings and their needs in order to train themselves to become both red and expert working-class intellectuals. This was a great encouragement and spur to us. This is how we took the first lesson of "going to the students." At that time, according to the arrangement of the Party group, we and the students formed groups together, held discussions, discussed the development outline of the entire department, everyone offered suggestions and suggestions, teachers and students jointly put forward various plans, and展开辩论。 In the process of discussion, the long-standing division between teachers and students gradually disappeared. At the beginning, some of the teachers still had the idea of "the more you say, the more mistakes you make" and "fear of affecting students' thinking", but these concerns were quickly dispelled by themselves. We and the students both felt that everyone was completely equal in the face of truth, and at the same time, both teachers and students gained a lot in breaking superstition and actively building. Teachers and students gradually came together.

The debate in this stage created very favorable conditions and forms for teacher-student cooperation. We initially realized the superiority of teacher-student cooperation under the leadership of the Party. Since then, the feeling of being passive has disappeared, and we have also realized the role of teaching each other. Some people feel that "a discussion without students is a bit boring." It should be said that the teacher-student relationship has undergone significant changes. However, what role teachers should play in teaching and scientific research is still an unresolved issue.

Next, the three-in-one groups of Chinese history, world history and archeology under the leadership of the Party were established. We decided to combine teaching and teacher-student cooperation to write outlines or teaching materials. The close cooperation between teachers and students began in this way, and the past situation of "teachers teaching themselves and students learning themselves" was broken. The common task united us and the students into a whole connected by flesh and blood. We also took the initiative to understand the students, worked with them from morning to night, and even felt a little lost if we occasionally did not participate in their virtual meetings at night. The problem of "putting down airs" was naturally solved. The students no longer had the feeling of being difficult to get along with teachers. Every effort we made was welcomed and encouraged by the students. Everyone felt that all their strength could be brought into play. At the same time, we also deeply realized that the key to whether teachers' strength can be brought into play lies in whether teachers can become one with students, take the initiative to care for and guide students' learning, and be able to adopt an equal attitude with students in the face of truth. Young people are very enthusiastic about teachers and can also be realistic. They have broken the undue superstition about teachers, which has not reduced their respect for teachers. In the three-in-one group, we worked as ordinary workers who obeyed the truth, so that they could learn truly useful knowledge. We realized that this was not at all a reduction in the role of teachers, but rather a more effective way to bring into play the strength of teachers in the process of teaching each other. This is how we taught and learned at the same time.

(III)
Therefore, in this stage of work, our mood was very comfortable. We had a great sense of turning from passive to active. Our mood was also very excited. We saw infinitely beautiful prospects.

We felt that there was a lot to be done, and we saw endless undertakings, because first of all, we felt that our strength could be fully brought into play. Under the leadership of the Party, in the masses, one point of heat can generate one point of light. In the past, some people did not know how to bring their strength into play, but now they feel that "everywhere is a place where they can bring their strength into play." In the past, students said, "The teaching and research section is dead," but now it is "the whole thing is alive." Everyone feels "energetic" and "motivated." We saw that our strength was brought into play as part of the strength of the masses, and the strength of the masses was so incomparably great. Secondly, we all felt that the young masses were an indispensable army in teaching and scientific research, and in the past, this army was not regarded as a regular combat team by us, and young teachers did not really combine with them. Now this rapidly growing team will play an immeasurable role in the cause of teaching and scientific research. The Party's great education policy has created such favorable conditions for us, and we must cherish it.

We saw the significant changes in the teacher-student relationship, which for us was a personal and huge event. A teacher said that now "teachers and students are mixed together, and teaching each other has grown." Some people say that "in the past, the teacher-student relationship was only a relationship between teaching and listening," but now everyone sees that teachers and students are a unity of opposites and complement each other. Everyone agrees with this saying, "Younger generations are not only awesome but also lovely." From the students' point of view, the teacher is not "arrogant but approachable" as imagined. Teachers and students unite to do a good job, argue to explore the truth, and teachers and students also unite to make great strides in politics. Some of us handed over our revised red and expert plans to the students for their opinions. The students enthusiastically copied them into big-character posters, decorated them all around, and added couplets: "Leap forward to open leap forward flowers, red and expert to order red and expert plans," with a horizontal banner in the middle saying "I love my teacher." How eagerly the students hope that the teacher will make progress soon! Can we fail their hopes? We recall the situation before liberation. Some people said, "In the past, students were regarded as spending money to buy knowledge, and giving them so-called knowledge was enough." Some people said, "In the past, only a few students were regarded as their own students, and most of them were not considered students, but only occasionally attended lectures." Compared with today's teacher-student relationship, it is simply like a world away.

We saw that the teacher-student combination led by the Party created very favorable conditions for our ideological transformation. Some people said: "The three-in-one itself is a very good way for intellectuals to transform themselves, giving them a way to go to the masses."

As mentioned above, we saw such broad prospects, saw our way forward, and saw the students so lovely and so promising. We felt that we had mastered our own destiny. We felt that after going through thousands of mountains and rivers, we finally found the truth we needed, and this truth was only such a superficial principle of putting down our airs and teaching each other, which made us feel like "I have searched for it everywhere, but I got it without any effort." We cannot but deeply thank the Party for giving us the education of continuous revolution and pointing out the way forward for us. Recalling the process of ideological transformation for more than a year, I really have a feeling of going from bitterness to sweetness.

Now, on the issue of teacher-student relations, we clearly see the concrete embodiment of the Party's mass line in schools, which is to oppose the expert line and value the role of experts, to mobilize students and to let teachers play a leading role. Because the quality of students' training is inseparable from teachers in the final analysis. Therefore, we feel that the title of teacher is very glorious in our society. We must strive to be both red and expert as soon as possible, and be truly worthy of this glorious title.

Everything should be attributed to the Party. Without the strength and specific leadership of the Party, such a combination of teachers and students would not be possible. The teacher-student relationship of the bourgeoisie is mainly a combination of commodity relations. The teacher-student relationship in feudal society is even a combination based on fictitious ethical relations. And today, our teachers and students are a combination of lofty comrades who take socialist and communist ideology as a common criterion and take building a new society and liberating all mankind as a common goal. The Party calls on us to unite closely for the cause of education and culture. This is how we are closely united around the Party. We will always be closely united and move forward.

    新的师生关系鼓舞着我们前进
    北京大学历史系教授　邓广铭　齐思和　邵循正　张芝联
    这一段时间，在党领导下师生合力从事教学工作的过程中，我们受了又一次深刻的教育。我们的体会比较集中在新的师生关系方面，这里，我们就将有关师生关系的一些体会和感想写出来。
   （一）
    一年多以来国内外形势鼓舞了我们，工农群众的冲天干劲教育了我们，双反运动提高了我们政治上和思想上的认识，学术思想批判使我们对于正确和错误观点的识别能力也有所增进。这一学年开始，我们和其他一些教师一样都抱着很大的热情，努力去提高教学的质量。但是，学生的反响还是不满意，认为教学内容和教学方法没有多少改变。
    问题究竟在哪里呢？在新的师生关系开始建立的今天，问题是很容易明白的。这就在于一方面我们没有懂得教与学是对立的统一，没有懂得在教学工作上要了解群众和依靠群众的道理；另一方面，我们虽然在一年多的运动中受了不少的教育，但是理论水平还没有很大的提高，在教学中理论和材料的结合一时也做不好，因此教学内容的改变，总是很有限的。此外，当时其他教学环节的改革，也还没有跟上来，因此学生不满意的反映是很自然的。今天，我们当中有人以“山穷水尽疑无路，柳暗花明又一村”说明自己心情的变化，这是很恰当的。但还应该补充说，不到山穷水尽，也就不易体会出来这个很基本的道理，也不能发现新的境界。
    实际上，“山穷水尽”的感觉，也并不是一天半天之间突然来的。一年多以来，政治上、思想上两条路线的斗争，使每人更清楚地认识自己。原先感到政治上有些进步的，看到自己原来还处在中游，原先感到学术上有些本钱的，看到自己还很不够。同时，过去留恋着“自留地”的人，认为“有自留地才能发挥自己所长”，现在认识到要把“自己精力完全放在党的统一安排之中才能对社会主义做到真正的贡献了。”因此，大破之后努力求立，这是人同此心的想法。我们都已坚决地放弃资产阶级的老路，但新的途径对于我们还是不熟悉的，走起来仍然有许多难关。首先，我们虽然承认破立是结合的，但又觉得一时立不起来。这一学年开始，在面临着新的教学任务之时，我们不能不或多或少地感到空虚和踌躇。例如，我们中一人是讲授隋唐史的，他过去在很多地方采用陈寅恪先生的论点，如隋唐统治者是以“关陇集团”为骨干，牛李党争是由于两党阶级基础不同的原故。这些错误的唯心主义的论点现在必须放弃了，但他一时拿不出新的东西来。后来采用教研室集体备课的办法，才把这道难关突破。但教学内容不容易短期内改好，这总是我们心上的一种负担。在另一方面，师生之间还没有足够的互相了解，特别是教师对于学生的思想感情以及学习上的困难和要求，知道很少，师生两方都有很大的热情，但都使不上劲。因此，从学生方面来的许多意见，是对先生一种督促和批评，但也就是教学、科学研究和生产劳动还未能很好的结合和新的师生关系还没有建立起来的反映，我们当时只想“教”得好，没有真正考虑同学如何“学”得好，应该说这是问题的一个关键。
    （二）
    就在这时候，党组织抓住了问题的关键，迅速地打开了局面。党组织号召我们放下架子，虚心听取群众的意见，和同学打成一片。对我们说，这并不是一件十分简单的事情。我们之中有人是从来没有到过学生宿舍的，对于如何放下架子，如何和同学们打成一片，我们也没有具体的了解。但是旧路子既然不通，只有按照党指示的路子走吧，这样，我们就到同学中去了。到了同学中之后，亲切热烈的气氛立刻把我们笼罩住了。我们才了解同学们为了要求把自己培养成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子，是如何迫切地期望教师们深入了解他们的心情和他们的需要。这对于我们是一个很大的鼓励和鞭策。我们就是这样上了“到同学中去”的第一课。当时按照党组的布置，我们和同学一起分组，座谈，讨论全系发展纲要，大家出谋献策，师生联名提出多样的方案，展开辩论。在讨论过程中，过去长期存在的师生的分野，逐渐地消失了。开头，教师中一些人还有“言多必失”和“怕影响同学思路”的想法，但这些顾虑自己很快地就解除了。我们和同学都感到在真理面前大家是完全平等的，同时无论在破除迷信和积极建设方面，师生都得了很大的收获。师生渐渐合在一起了。
    这一阶段的辩论，给师生合作创造了十分有利的条件和形式，我们初步体会到党领导下师生合作的优越性，从此被动的感觉没有了，我们也体会到教学相长的作用。有人感到“没有同学参加的讨论会有点不带劲了。”应该说，师生关系有了显著的改变。但是，教师在教学和科学研究中究竟应该起什么作用，还是一个未解决的问题。
    接着，党领导下的中国史、世界史和考古学三个三结合小组成立了。我们决定结合教学，师生合作编写大纲或是教材。师生间紧密无间的合作就这样开始了，过去“教者自教、学者自学”的局面打破了。共同的任务把我们和同学结成血肉相连的整体，我们也主动去了解同学，从早到晚和他们一起工作，晚上偶然不参加他们的务虚会还觉得若有所失。“放下架子”的问题自然而然地解决了，同学也再没有和教师难与相处的感觉，我们付出每一分的劳动都得到同学的欢迎和鼓励，大家都感到自己所有的力量都能发挥出来了。同时我们也深深体会到教师力量能否发挥的关键，不在别的，而在于教师是否和同学打成一片，主动去关怀和指导学生学习，并且能够在真理面前和同学采取平等的态度。青年人对于教师是十分热情，也能实事求是的。他们打破了对教师不应有的迷信，这并没有减少他们对教师的尊重。我们在三结合小组中，以一个服从真理的普通劳动者的资格，为他们学习真正有用的知识而工作。我们认识到这完全不是降低教师的作用，而是应该说在教学相长的过程中更有效地发挥教师的力量。我们就如此一面教、一面学了。
    （三）
    因此，在这一阶段的工作中，我们的心情是十分舒畅的。我们大有从被动而转入主动之感。我们的心情也是十分兴奋的，我们看到无限美好的远景。
    我们感到大有可为，看到有做不尽的事业，这是因为首先，我们感到自己的力量能够充分地发挥了。在党的领导下，在群众中，有一分热就能发一分光。过去有人不知应该如何发挥自己的力量，现在感到“到处都是可以发挥力量的地方”。过去同学说，“教研室是死沉沉的”，现在是“整个儿活了”。大家都感到“有劲头”
  “有干头”了。我们看到自己力量是作为群众力量的一部分而得到发挥的，而群众的力量又是那样无比的巨大。其次，我们都感到青年群众是教学和科学研究中一支不可缺少的大军，而在过去这支大军是没有被我们当作正规战斗队伍看待的，青年教师们也没有和他们真正结合。现在这支迅速成长中的大队伍对于教学和科学研究的事业将起不可限量的作用。党的伟大的教育方针给我们创造了这样有利条件，我们一定要珍视它。
    我们看到师生关系的显著变化，这对于我们说来，是一桩切身的、巨大的事件，一个教师说现在“师生揉在一起，教学相长了。”有人说“过去师生只是讲与听的关系”，现在大家看出师生是对立而又相成的统一体了，大家都同意这样一种说法，“后生不但可畏而且可爱了。”从同学方面看来，先生不是所想像的“盛气凌人而是平易近人”了，师生为搞好工作而团结，为探讨真理而争辩，师生也为了在政治上的大步迈进而团结。我们当中有人把自己修订的红专规划交给同学征求意见，同学热情地把它抄成大字报，四周加以装饰，配上对联：“跃进里开跃进之花，红专中订红专规划”，中间横幅写着“我爱我师”。同学是多么殷切地盼望先生快点进步呵！我们能辜负他们的希望吗？我们回想解放前的情况，有人说“过去是把学生看作花钱来买知识的，给他们所谓知识就是了。”有人说“过去只把少数的学生看做是自己的学生，大多数都不算是学生，只是偶然听讲而已”这和今天师生关系比较起来，简直是如同隔世了。
    我们看到党领导的师生结合给我们的思想改造创造了非常有利的条件，有人说：“三结合本身就是知识分子改造的一个很好的途径，给他们以到群众中去的道路”。
    如上所说，我们看到这样广阔的前途，看到自己前进的道路，看到同学们的如此可爱，如此有为，我们感到掌握住自己的命运了。我们感到历尽千山万水终于找到了自己所需要的真理，而这个真理又只是这样浅显的放下架子教学相长的道理，使我们又有“踏破铁鞋无觅处，得来全不费工夫”之感，我们不能不深深感谢党给我们不断革命的教育，给我们指出了前进的道路。回味一年多思想改造的过程，真有从苦到甜的感觉。
    现在我们在师生关系的问题上，清楚地看出党在学校中群众路线的具体体现，既要反对专家路线，又要重视专家作用，既要发动学生，又要教师起主导作用。因为学生培养的好坏和教师归根到底是分不开的。因此我们感到教师的称号在我们社会中是十分光荣的。我们要努力争取早日红透专深，能够真正无愧于这个光荣称号。
    一切应该归功于党，没有党的力量和具体领导，师生这样的结合是不可能达到的。资产阶级的师生主要是商品关系的结合。封建社会师生甚至是依靠虚构的伦常关系的结合。而今天，我们师生是以社会主义、共产主义思想为共同准则，以建设新社会解放全人类为共同目标的崇高的同志的结合。党号召我们为了教育和文化事业而紧密团结，我们就是这样紧密地团结在党的周围。我们永久紧密地团结前进。
