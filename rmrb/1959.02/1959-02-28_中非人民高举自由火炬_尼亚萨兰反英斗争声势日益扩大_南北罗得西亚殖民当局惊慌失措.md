Xinhua News Agency, February 27th, Blantyre dispatch: The struggle of the people of Nyasaland against colonial rule is developing. According to news on the 26th, the main highway between Nyasaland and East Africa has been controlled by Africans in Nyasaland, who have also taken over a customs and excise post in Hillborough. This tax office is located on the only road that colonial troops from East Africa could take to enter the northern provinces of Nyasaland. In the past few days, the colonial authorities in Tanganyika, East Africa, have been transferring troops to the border close to Nyasaland.

The only airport in northern Nyasaland capable of landing Dakota aircraft—Hillborough Airport—was still in the hands of the African people on the 26th, where they had piled up oil drums and tree trunks. The authorities' reinforcements have been unable to land. Now, the colonial authorities can only send reinforcements to Hillborough via more than 500 miles of dirt roads, sections of which are almost impassable during the current rainy season.

In Kafukule, Nyasaland, a convoy of colonial troops was obstructed and attacked with stones on the 26th. On the same day, an incident of attacking colonizers also occurred in Mlanje.

According to Salisbury, after Southern Rhodesia declared a "state of emergency" on the 26th, the colonial authorities are stepping up arrests. Those arrested include Chikilima, acting chairman of the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, and Secretary-General Antulo.

The colonial authorities are using various means to suppress the major strike at the Kariba Dam in Southern Rhodesia. In addition to dispatching troops there for armed suppression, the colonial-run company contracting for the project is also undermining the strike by firing so-called "agitators" and "dissidents" and promising small wage increases. Many people who refused to return to work were forcibly transported back to Salisbury by the authorities in buses. Nevertheless, by the morning of the 27th, a quarter of the workers continued to persist in the struggle and did not go to work.

According to Lusaka, the Governor of Northern Rhodesia said on the evening of the 26th that it was not yet necessary to declare a "state of emergency" in Northern Rhodesia. However, he also said that the authorities are closely watching the development of the situation and that he will take timely action whenever ordinary powers are insufficient to cope with the situation.

    中非人民高举自由火炬
    尼亚萨兰反英斗争声势日益扩大
    南北罗得西亚殖民当局惊慌失措
    新华社27日讯　布兰太尔消息：尼亚萨兰人民反对殖民统治的斗争在发展中。据26日消息说，尼亚萨兰同东非之间的主要公路线已经被尼亚萨兰的非洲人控制，他们还接管了希尔堡的一个海关税务所。这个税务所位于东非的殖民军队要想开进尼亚萨兰北部省份所可能通过的唯一道路上。在过去几天中，东非坦噶尼喀殖民当局一直在把军队调到紧挨着尼亚萨兰的边境上去。
    尼亚萨兰北部能够降落达科他飞机的唯一机场——希尔堡机场26日仍在非洲人民的手中，他们在那里堆满了油桶和树干。当局的增援部队已经无法降落。现在，殖民当局运送援兵只有通过五百多英里的土路才能到达希尔堡，而这条路的若干地段在目前雨季几乎无法通行。
    在尼亚萨兰的卡富库尔，殖民军队的车队26日受到阻挡和石头的袭击。同一天，在姆兰杰也发生了一起袭击殖民者的事件。
    据索耳兹伯里消息，南罗得西亚在26日宣布处于“紧急状态”后，殖民当局正加紧进行逮捕。被捕的包括南罗得西亚非洲人国民大会代理主席契克里马和总书记安都罗。
    殖民当局正用各种手段镇压南罗得西亚卡里巴水坝的大罢工。除了调遣军队到那里进行武装镇压外，承包这项工程的殖民者经营的公司还用解雇所谓的“煽动分子”和“不满分子”和答应提高少许工资的办法来破坏罢工。许多拒绝恢复工作的人在当局的强制下被用公共汽车送回索耳兹伯里。尽管如此，到27日上午，还有四分之一的工人继续坚持斗争，没有上工。
    据卢萨喀消息，北罗得西亚总督在26日晚上说，目前在北罗得西亚宣布“紧急状态”还不必要。但是他又说，当局正密切注视着局势的发展，任何时候如果通常权力不足应付局势，他将适时地采取行动。
