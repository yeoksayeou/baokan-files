Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 2nd: The Chongqing Air Compressor Factory has reversed the past trend of sluggishness at the beginning of the year. After a period of intense effort in January, it has comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan, with a total output value exceeding the plan by 8.5%.

This year, the factory has a significant production task. In January alone, without increasing equipment or manpower, the entire factory had to complete 10% more work than the high-yield month of December last year. At the very beginning of this year, the factory grasped the key links in production organization, such as production preparation, production planning, production measures, and production inspection. In particular, combined with summarizing last year's production experience, the factory thoroughly disclosed this year's production tasks, favorable conditions, and difficulties to the masses, and mobilized them to formulate the production plans for the first quarter and January. The workers clarified their tasks and the key problems in production, and were full of confidence. From the very first day of this year, they launched a high-yield competition with the momentum of "people not leaving the saddle and horses not stopping," striving for the four "firsts" – the first day, the first ten days, the first month, and the first quarter. In the competition, Xiong Rongchang, a lathe operator from the fourth workshop, took the lead and improved the mold for processing air compressor connecting rods, increasing efficiency by 150%. By the 17th, he had completed the January plan, greatly boosting the confidence of the entire workshop in completing the monthly plan. At the same time, the factory's Party and government leaders strengthened their leadership in the daily labor competition, went deep into the workshops and groups for inspection, promptly exchanged good experiences, and solved problems at any time. Therefore, for a month, the entire factory has maintained a vigorous and thriving atmosphere.

    重庆空气压缩机厂今年开门红
    总产值盖过去年高产月
    据新华社重庆2日电　重庆空气压缩机厂改变历年来年初松的现象，1月份经过紧张的战斗，已经全面超额完成国家计划，总产值超过计划8.5％。
    这个厂今年的生产任务很大，仅1月份，全厂不增加设备和人力，就要完成比去年高产月——12月份的总工作量还大10％的任务。厂里今年一开头就抓紧了生产准备、生产计划、生产措施、生产检查等组织生产的几个重要环节。特别是结合总结去年生产经验，把今年的生产任务、有利条件和困难，通盘地向群众交底，发动群众制订今年第一季度和1月份的生产计划。职工们明确了任务和生产中的关键问题，信心十足，从今年的第一天起，就以“人不离鞍，马不停蹄”之势，掀起抓四个“第一”——第一天、第一旬、第一月、第一季的高产竞赛热潮。在竞赛中，四车间的车工熊荣昌一马当先，改进了加工空气压缩机连杆的模具，提高效率一倍半，到17日就完成了1月份的计划，大大提高了全车间完成月计划的信心。与此同时，厂的党政领导加强了日常劳动竞赛的领导，深入车间、小组进行检查，及时交流好的经验，随时解决问题。因此，一个月来，全厂一直保持蓬蓬勃勃的朝气。
