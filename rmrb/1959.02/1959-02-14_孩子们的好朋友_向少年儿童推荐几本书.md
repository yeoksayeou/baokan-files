The first collection of "Red Youngsters" has rich and colorful content. The first article is Comrade Chen Changfeng's story "Beside Chairman Mao."

In the third collection, there are four groups of poems and essays: "Oppose the American Aggressors," "Sing Praises to the Good Leadership of the Party," "Glorious! The Ming Tombs Reservoir," and "Workers' Enthusiasm Breaks Through the Sky." These works reflect the Chinese people's determination and strength to love peace but not fear war. Among them, the feature "The Iron Shovel Used by Chairman Mao" and worker poems such as "The First Tractor is Born" allow us to see the glorious examples of our beloved Chairman Mao and worker comrades loving labor, and also see the new grand atmosphere of the motherland's industrial Great Leap Forward. In addition, there are many short and vivid works that express the various aspects of life and enthusiasm of children and young people in the Great Leap Forward.

*Following the Communist Party Since Childhood* (by Huang Qingyun) is a book in which a Communist Party member narrates his childhood experiences. In 1929, when he was just sensible, he received the Party's education and participated in revolutionary activities. He was loyal to the revolution, firmly fought against the enemy, and was brave in overcoming his shortcomings. He always followed the Communist Party and, under the Party's cultivation, grew into a strong revolutionary fighter. The book describes the activities of the children's corps in the early days of the revolution, where they stood guard, kept watch, delivered intelligence, and scouted enemy situations... Through the description of these activities, today's children and young people are vividly given an education in revolutionary traditions.

*The Little Members of the Railway Guerrilla* (by Liu Zhixia) People are very familiar with the sensational "Railway Guerrilla." "The Little Members of the Railway Guerrilla" is its sister piece. It describes a group of children of railway workers on the Lunan Railway during the Anti-Japanese War, who participated in the Railway Guerrilla under the leadership of Captain Liu Hong. They blocked trains, seized enemy supplies, and assisted the long gun team in the battle of Zaozhuang, eliminating all the enemies.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, these little heroes of the Railway Guerrilla assisted the People's Liberation Army in successfully completing a reconnaissance mission and defeated the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The little members grew up strongly in the test of battle.

The old man taught the cowboy king to sing songs of pursuing freedom and happiness. The singing angered the landlord and his lackey, Fatty Landlord. The landlord and Fatty Landlord designed to harm the cowboy king, punishing him to graze cattle all day without giving him food, and having to carry ninety-nine vats of water at night. The kind old magpie told him a secret to seek freedom and happiness. With the secret, the cowboy king found the golden reed and made a reed pipe. Relying on the reed pipe and the help of good friends, he overcame his arrogance and finally defeated the landlord, Fatty Landlord, and the 50,000 soldiers sent by the emperor.
