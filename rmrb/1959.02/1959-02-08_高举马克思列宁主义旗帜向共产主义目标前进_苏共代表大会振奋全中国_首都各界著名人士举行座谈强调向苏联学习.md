Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Prominent figures from all circles in the capital today warmly celebrated the success of the 21st Extraordinary Congress of the CPSU. At a forum jointly held by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, people from all walks of life unanimously pointed out that the CPSU Congress was an epoch-making meeting of great historical significance. It pointed out the direction of historical development and a brilliant future in the face of all mankind with the reality of life.

Participants in the forum included heads of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, democratic parties, people's organizations, workers, peasants, the People's Liberation Army, scientists, and writers.

Wu Yuzhang, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, presided over the forum. He said that the 21st Congress of the CPSU, which had victoriously closed, would be recorded in Soviet history as the Congress of Communist Builders. The control figures for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union from 1959 to 1965, adopted at the congress, are a magnificent program for the comprehensive development of communist construction in the Soviet Union. Wu Yuzhang said that precisely because of this, the congress guided the people of the entire Soviet Union, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and advancing towards the great goal of communism.

Wu Yuzhang said that the victorious convocation of this congress aroused national celebration. It will not only accelerate the construction of communism in the Soviet Union, but also make significant contributions to the development of the international communist movement and the strengthening of world peace forces. The congress also vividly demonstrated the Soviet Union's strength, prosperity, love of peace, and unity. All those who fight for peace and socialism have received great encouragement from this congress. Wu Yuzhang warmly congratulated the Soviet people on their new victories in the comprehensive development of communist construction, and congratulated the working people of the world, inspired by the 21st Congress of the CPSU, on their new victories in their struggles. Finally, he said that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, felt extremely jubilant and encouraged by the success of the 21st Congress of the CPSU. These days, the whole country is rejoicing, which shows that the Chinese and Soviet peoples are flesh and blood, closely united together.

Shen Junru, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, said enthusiastically at the meeting that the CPSU Congress was a great success. The Soviet Union's seven-year plan is a plan to move towards communism, and it is also an encouraging force for the Great Leap Forward of the Chinese people. Our enemies are greatly shaken by this, and world peace will be better guaranteed. He warmly congratulated the success of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, and congratulated the strength and unity of China and the Soviet Union.

Huang Yanpei, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said that we congratulate the success of the CPSU Congress with the warmest feelings. The path taken by the Soviet Union has inevitably led them to achieve such great achievements today. We in China have also taken this path for more than nine years, so we are also achieving great achievements. He said that in the future, he would express his congratulations to the CPSU Congress with better learning, harder work, and strengthening self-transformation.

Many people praised the great significance of the Soviet seven-year plan in their speeches. Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said: The CPSU Congress is a congress where communist builders pledged to march towards communism, and a congress to open up the road to the lofty ideal of a communist society for mankind. This congress has aroused great and profound attention from Chinese workers and has given great encouragement to Chinese workers who are working hard. He said that Chinese workers have repeatedly expressed that they must learn from the communist spirit of Soviet workers and strive to complete and overfulfill the state's production plan for 1959. Shao Lizi, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said at the meeting that some people compared the Soviet seven-year plan to a political space rocket, which is very appropriate. If the speed, weight, and accuracy of a space rocket can be calculated with numbers, then the great significance of the seven-year plan is not easy to calculate with numbers. He said that now the mood of joy and encouragement is spreading throughout China, and we must learn better and strengthen our labor better in the future. Deng Tuo, President of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said in his speech that the targets set in the Soviet seven-year plan are very alarming, the Soviet economic foundation is so strong, and the targets of the seven-year plan prove that the ideals that mankind has long yearned for will not be so far away in the future.

Many speakers pointed out that the CPSU Congress showed that the forces defending world peace have become unprecedentedly strong. Chen Shutong, Li Zhuchen, and Chen Qiyou and others pointed out that progressive people in all countries of the world are rejoicing at the great role played by this congress in maintaining world peace, and affirmed that imperialist countries will be far behind in the peace competition.

Burhan said that this congress will further encourage the people of the world to fight for the defense of peace, and will further encourage the upsurge of national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Wang Shao'ao said that the socialist system is a system that advocates peace and benefits the people. The CPSU Congress fully demonstrated to all mankind that the forces of peace are growing stronger day by day, and imperialism should not act rashly. The writer Lao She said that this congress makes everyone who cares about the fate of mankind have to think deeply: which way should history go, east or west. He said that it must go east, because the news sent by the east wind is: the history that the Soviet Union is going to create is a history of seeking happiness for mankind. Lao She said that the achievements of the congress showed the invincible power of peace forces, and the advantages of the West are gone forever. Wang Zhiping, a representative of the People's Liberation Army with the rank of Major General, said that the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union makes imperialism hate and fear. The Soviet Union's defense forces are the strongest. Today, if imperialists dare to launch aggression, it will be enough to make them suffer complete destruction.

The unprecedented growth of the international communist movement made everyone present feel excited. Many people at the meeting condemned the shameless rumors, slanders, and sabotage of imperialists and revisionists. They unanimously emphasized the great significance of consolidating the unity of the international workers' movement, especially the unity of the Chinese and Soviet people. Li Dequan said at the meeting that the Soviet Union and China are fraternal countries of socialism, and Marxism-Leninism closely unites our two countries and all socialist countries. The fate of China and the Soviet Union is common, our interests are the same, and the US imperialists and Yugoslav modern revisionists are despicably provoking the unity between China and the Soviet Union, and they will definitely be disappointed. Xu Deheng, Ji Fang and others emphasized the great significance of this congress and the heavy blow to Yugoslav modern revisionism in their speeches. The painter Yu Fei'an emphasized the need to further strengthen the traditional friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Many people expressed that they would learn from the Soviet Union better in the future to accelerate China's socialist construction. Zhang Shugui, a worker at the Beijing Steel Plant and a labor model, said that the victory of the Soviet Union is our victory, and this congress is a great happy event for our entire socialist camp. He said that he must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and strive to achieve the national annual steel production of 18 million tons with revolutionary soaring energy. Yang Dechun, Deputy Director of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Society of the Shijingshan People's Commune and agricultural labor model, said that he would further learn from the Soviet Union and strive to double the commune's grain and vegetable production this year. Scientists Zhu Kezhen, Mao Yisheng, and Qian Sanqiang introduced the great achievements of Soviet science and technology in their speeches. They proposed that they should strive to learn from the Soviet Union in the future, and believed that as long as they worked harder and learned from the Soviet Union better, China's science and technology would also develop rapidly.

Qian Junrui spoke at the end, emphasizing that the victory of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was a decisive and serious blow to the attempt by imperialism and modern revisionism to undermine the unity of the socialist camp and Sino-Soviet friendship. He said that the imperialists and modern revisionists are most afraid of the friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union and the socialist countries, so they use their greatest strength to spread rumors and provoke trouble, trying to undermine our unity. However, this congress gave them the most powerful and resounding slap in the face. Qian Junrui said that the friendly unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable by any force in the world. This great friendship is built on the most solid foundation - Marxism-Leninism, and it will always be continuously strengthened and developed. The consolidation and development of this greatest friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is a decisive factor in winning the cause of human progress.

At the conclusion of the forum, Wu Yuzhang once again emphasized that the people of China and the Soviet Union will forever work together to build a new communist world. We are bound to win.

Those who spoke and submitted written speeches at the forum also included Zhong Huilan, Liang Buting, Gao Jingde, Le Songsheng, Gao Zhaoqing, Chen Yuan, Rong Gaotang, Liu Han, Zhang Jiexun, and Wang Jialiu.

The forum unanimously agreed to send a telegram to Comrade Andreyev, Chairman of the Council of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, congratulating him on the achievements of the 21st Congress of the CPSU.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association sent a telegram to Comrade Andreyev, Chairman of the Council of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, congratulating him on the achievements of the 21st Congress of the CPSU. The text of the telegram is as follows: To Comrade Andreyev, Chairman of the Council of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association in Moscow, Dear Comrade Andreyev:

As the 21st Extraordinary Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union victoriously closed, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association jointly held a forum. The forum was presided over by Comrade Wu Yuzhang, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. The main leaders of our country's democratic parties and people's organizations, model workers of industry and agriculture, representatives of youth, women, and the People's Liberation Army, as well as well-known social figures and famous writers and scientists were invited to attend the forum. Everyone unanimously cheered and expressed heartfelt congratulations on the great success of the 21st Extraordinary Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

In their speeches, everyone excitedly pointed out that this congress was an epoch-making congress of great historical significance. It not only guided the people of the entire Soviet Union, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, to advance towards the great goal of communism, but also pointed out the direction of historical development for all mankind. The Soviet seven-year plan for the development of the national economy is a magnificent program for building communism, which has greatly enhanced and encouraged the confidence of the people all over the world in the struggle for peace. The forum pointed out with great satisfaction that this congress once again used iron-like facts to completely shatter the shameful conspiracy of the imperialists and their despicable tools - the modern revisionists - to undermine the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

This great contribution made by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people vigorously encourages the Chinese people to accelerate socialist construction and safeguard world peace with full confidence.

The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, will continue to adhere to learning from the great Soviet people, and will continue to work tirelessly to consolidate and strengthen the unbreakable great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!

    新华社7日讯　首都各界著名人士今天热烈欢庆苏共二十一次非常代表大会的成功。在中苏友好协会总会和北京市中苏友好协会联合举行的座谈会上，各界人士一致指出，苏共这次大会是一次划时代的具有伟大历史意义的会议，它在全人类面前以生活的现实指出了历史发展的方向和辉煌的远景。
    参加这次座谈会的有中苏友好协会、各民主党派、各人民团体的负责人，有工人、农民、解放军部队以及科学家和作家等各方面的人士。
    中苏友好协会总会副会长吴玉章主持这次座谈会，他说，已经胜利闭幕的苏共二十一次代表大会，将作为共产主义建设者的代表大会列入苏联的史册。大会上通过的1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的控制数字，是苏联全面展开共产主义建设的宏伟纲领。吴玉章说，正因为这样，这次代表大会引导着全苏联人民，高举着马克思列宁主义的旗帜，向着共产主义的伟大目标前进。
    吴玉章说，这次大会的胜利召开，引起了全民的欢庆，它不仅将加速苏联共产主义建设，而且将在发展国际共产主义运动和增强世界和平力量方面，作出重大的贡献；这次大会也生动地显示了苏联的强大繁荣，爱好和平和团结一致。一切为和平和社会主义斗争的人们，从这次代表大会得到了巨大的鼓舞。吴玉章热烈地祝贺苏联人民在全面展开共产主义建设事业中获得新的胜利，祝贺在苏共二十一次代表大会鼓舞下的全世界劳动人民在自己的斗争中获得新的胜利。最后他说，在中国共产党领导下的中国人民，对苏共二十一次代表大会的成功感到极大的欢欣鼓舞。这几天来，举国欢腾，这说明中苏两国人民是血肉相连，紧密地团结在一起的。
    中苏友协总会副会长、民盟中央主席沈钧儒在会上热情地说，苏共这次代表大会开得太好了，苏联的七年计划是向共产主义前进的计划，它对中国人民的大跃进也是一个鼓舞的力量。我们的敌人对此大为震动，世界和平将更有保证。他热烈地表示庆贺苏共二十一次代表大会的成功，庆贺中苏两国的强大和团结。
    中苏友协总会副会长、民建中央主任委员黄炎培说，我们以最热烈的心情庆贺苏共代表大会的成功，苏联所走的道路使他们必然取得今天这样伟大的成就，我们中国九年多来也走了这样的道路，因此我们也正在取得伟大的成就。他表示今后要以更好的学习，更努力的工作，加强自我改造等实际行动来表示对苏共代表大会的庆贺。
    许多人在发言中颂扬苏联七年计划的伟大意义，中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜说：苏共这次代表大会是共产主义建设者誓师向共产主义进军的大会，是向人类崇高理想共产主义社会开拓道路的大会，这次大会引起了中国工人极大的深刻的注意，给正在鼓足干劲的中国工人以极大的鼓舞。他说，中国工人都一再地表示要好好学习苏联工人的共产主义精神，争取完成和超额完成1959年国家的生产计划。中苏友协总会副会长邵力子在会上说，有人把苏联七年计划比作政治上的宇宙火箭，这是非常恰当的，如果说宇宙火箭的速度、重量和准确性可以用数字来计算的话，那么七年计划的伟大意义是不容易用数字来计算的。他说，现在欢欣鼓舞的情绪遍于全中国，我们今后要更好地学习，更好地加强我们的劳动。北京市中苏友好协会会长邓拓在发言中认为，苏联七年计划所提出的指标是十分惊人的，苏联的经济基础是那样的雄厚，七年计划的指标证明人类长期向往的理想将不是那样遥远的将来了。
    许多发言者指出，苏共这次大会表明世界保卫和平的力量已经空前强大。陈叔通、李烛尘和陈其尤等人指出，全世界所有国家的进步人士为这次大会在维护世界和平方面所起的巨大作用而感到欢欣鼓舞，肯定地说，帝国主义国家在和平竞赛中将被远远地抛在后面。
    包尔汉说，这次大会将进一步鼓舞全世界人民为保卫和平而奋斗，更将鼓舞亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动的高涨。王绍鏊说，社会主义制度就是主张和平和为人民造福的制度，苏共这次代表大会充分地向全人类显示出，和平力量正在一天天强大起来，帝国主义休想轻举妄动。作家老舍说，这次大会使一切关心人类命运的人必须深思：历史该朝哪边走，是往东还是往西。他说，一定是往东走，因为东风送来的消息是：苏联所要创造的历史是为人类谋幸福的历史。老舍说，大会的成就显示了和平力量的无敌威力，西方的优势一去不复返了。解放军代表王之平少将说，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营力量的强大，使帝国主义又仇恨，又害怕。苏联的国防力量是最强大的，今天如果帝国主义者胆敢发动侵略，就足以使它们遭到完全的毁灭。
    国际共产主义运动的空前壮大，使每一个到会的人都感到兴奋。会上许多人斥责了帝国主义和修正主义者的无耻造谣诽谤和破坏，他们一致强调巩固国际工人运动的团结、尤其是中苏两国人民团结的重大意义。李德全在会上说，苏联和中国是社会主义的兄弟之邦，马克思列宁主义把我们两国以及所有社会主义国家紧密地团结在一起，中苏两国的命运是共同的，我们的利害是一致的，美帝国主义者和南斯拉夫现代修正主义者卑鄙地挑拨中苏的团结，肯定它们是要失望的。许德珩、季方等人在发言中强调了这次大会的重大意义以及对南斯拉夫现代修正主义的沉重打击。国画家于非闇强调要进一步加强中苏两国人民的传统友谊。许多人表示今后要更好地学习苏联，加速我国的社会主义建设。北京钢厂工人、劳动模范张树贵说，苏联的胜利就是我们的胜利，这次大会是我们整个社会主义阵营的大喜事。他表示一定要学习苏联先进经验，以革命的冲天干劲为实现全国年产一千八百万吨钢而奋斗。石景山人民公社中苏友好社副主任、农业劳动模范杨德春表示要进一步向苏联学习，争取全社今年的粮食和蔬菜生产再翻一番。科学家竺可桢、茅以升、钱三强在发言中介绍了苏联科学技术的伟大成就，他们提出今后要努力向苏联学习，并且相信，只要加倍努力和更好地向苏联学习，中国的科学技术也会得到迅速的发展。
    钱俊瑞最后发言，他强调指出，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的胜利，是对帝国主义和现代修正主义企图破坏社会主义阵营的团结和中苏友谊的一个决定性的严重打击。他说，帝国主义和现代修正主义者最害怕中苏两国以及社会主义各国间的友好团结，因而他们以最大的力量来进行造谣挑拨，企图破坏我们的团结。然而这次代表大会正给了他们最有力、最响亮的耳光。钱俊瑞说，中苏两国人民之间的友好团结是世界上任何力量都破坏不了的，这种伟大友谊是建立在最牢固的基础——马克思列宁主义的基础上，它将永远不断地增强和发展下去。中苏两国人民间的这种最伟大友谊的巩固和发展，是争取人类进步事业胜利的决定因素。
    在结束座谈时，吴玉章再一次强调说，中苏两国人民将永远同心协力建设共产主义新世界。我们是一定会胜利的。
    在座谈会上发言和书面发言的还有锺惠澜、梁步庭、高景德、乐松生、高兆庆、陈垣、荣高棠、刘汉、张洁珣、汪家镠等人。
    座谈会最后一致同意致电苏中友好协会理事会主席安德烈耶夫同志，祝贺苏共二十一次代表大会的成就。
