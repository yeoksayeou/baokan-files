Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, February 23rd: Fujian Province recently sent more than 10,000 cadres to factories and rural areas for labor training, and at the same time transferred a group of leading cadres at the county level and above to rural areas to participate in rectification work. More than 1,000 cadres designated by provincial-level agencies to be sent to lower levels have begun to go to the countryside and factories in succession from the 20th; most of the cadres sent by various districts and county-level agencies have arrived at their new positions. The cadres sent to the countryside have plunged into the vigorous spring plowing campaign.

Fujian Province reaped great gains from sending more than 8,000 cadres to participate in labor training last year. This year, after the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China made a decision to continue sending cadres to lower levels for labor training, it received enthusiastic responses from cadres at all levels. They wrote letters of determination, guarantee letters, and application letters to the Party organization, requesting to be sent to lower levels for labor training. The cadres who were approved were very excited and received warm congratulations from comrades and relatives. They said that they must work hard in labor training and strive for a double harvest in production and thought.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, February 23rd: The leading organs at all levels of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have transferred a large number of cadres to factories and rural areas for labor training. More than 1,300 cadres designated by the directly affiliated agencies of the autonomous region have begun to depart successively from the 21st. They are divided into 89 groups and sent to people's communes and factories in 58 counties and cities to work. Before this, Wuzhou, Nanning, Liuzhou and other regions had also sent a large number of cadres to lower levels.

Among the cadres sent to lower levels are heads of various departments and bureaus of the directly affiliated agencies of the autonomous region, secretaries of prefectural, municipal, and county Party committees, and ministers of various departments. After being sent to lower levels, they all appear as ordinary laborers, eating, living, and working with the masses, and are warmly welcomed by the masses.

Wuzhou Prefecture sent 6,000 cadres to lower levels this year, accounting for 30% of the total number of existing cadres. Many areas have also selected some cadres sent to lower levels to serve as cooks in public canteens of the communes. Wuming, Huanjiang, Mashan, Chongzuo, and Fusui counties sent 2,211 cadres to serve as cooks in public canteens of the communes.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, February 23rd: More than 1,580 cadres sent to lower levels by the provincial-level agencies of Guizhou Province this year will arrive at the grassroots units one after another.

The broad masses of cadres in Guizhou Province once again expressed their enthusiastic support for the Party's policy of sending cadres to lower levels this year. Within a day or two after the provincial Party committee's mobilization, more than 95% of the cadres in the provincial-level agencies actively applied, eagerly hoping to go to lower levels for labor training. Many people hoped for at least one year of training, and hoped to be sent to remote mountainous areas to work hard.

Among the cadres sent to lower levels by Guizhou provincial-level agencies this year, there are 33 cadres including members of the provincial Party committee standing committee, ministers of various departments of the provincial Party committee, and directors and bureau chiefs of the provincial people's committee and above. Among all the cadres sent to lower levels, in addition to a few who are assigned to positions at the grassroots level, and cadres from the industrial transportation, finance and trade systems who go to grassroots enterprises to work, the majority of cadres are sent to people's communes for labor training, such as participating in field labor, serving as breeders, cooks, nursery workers, factory workers, etc. In addition to participating in various production labors, the cadres sent to lower levels will also become an active force in consolidating the people's communes, carrying out technological innovation, and carrying out red flag competitions.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, February 23rd: Gansu Province has decided to transfer more than 1,000 cadres at the county level and above from the three levels of provincial, prefectural, and county agencies to the people's communes, so that each of the 544 people's communes in the province can be equipped with one to five leading cadres. The first batch of 89 cadres sent to lower levels by the provincial-level agencies will arrive at their posts at the end of February. Among them, 49% have served as county Party secretaries, county heads, and grassroots work, and have generally undergone a long period of revolutionary training. The first batch of cadres transferred from the prefectures and counties are also mostly department and bureau chiefs, county Party secretaries and county heads, and they have already assumed positions in the communes.

Zhang Zhongliang, First Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke with the first batch of cadres sent to the communes by the provincial-level agencies on the 19th. He said: From last year's practice, it can be seen that sending cadres to lower levels played a great role in promoting the development of various tasks in 1958, and was one of the factors in last year's Great Leap Forward. Sending cadres to the grassroots level allows them to be able to work at both higher and lower levels, and to be able to work, labor, and study, so that we can train a group of communist cadres who can withstand any risks. He encouraged everyone to strengthen self-transformation in practical training, gradually achieve both red and expert, and in practical work, to use dialectics, to study, grasp, and skillfully use the laws of development of objective things, and strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year, and better complete and overfulfill various production targets.

    福建广西贵州甘肃下放大批干部劳动锻炼和充实基层
    新华社福州23日电　福建省最近有一万多干部下放到工厂和农村去劳动锻炼，同时抽调了一批县级以上的领导干部到农村参加整社工作。省级机关确定下放的一千多名干部，已经从20日起陆续下乡下厂；各专区、县级机关的下放干部大部分已经到达新的岗位。下放到农村的干部，已投入了轰轰烈烈的备耕运动。
    福建省去年下放八千多干部参加劳动锻炼，收获很大。今年，中共福建省委作出继续下放干部进行劳动锻炼的决定后，受到了各级机关干部的热烈响应。他们纷纷写了决心书、保证书、申请书，送给党的组织，要求下放劳动锻炼。得到批准的干部都非常兴奋，受到了同志和亲友的热烈祝贺。他们表示一定要在下放劳动中好好锻炼，力争生产、思想双丰收。
    新华社南宁23日电　广西僮族自治区各级领导机关抽调大批干部下放到工厂、农村劳动锻炼。自治区直属机关确定下放的一千三百多名干部，已经从21日开始陆续出发。他们分成八十九个小组，下放到五十八个县、市的人民公社和工厂去劳动。在这以前，梧州、南宁、柳州等地区也都下放了大批干部。
    在下放干部中，有自治区直属机关各厅、局负责人，地、市、县党委书记及各部部长等，他们下放以后都以普通劳动者的姿态出现，与群众同吃同住同劳动，受到群众的热烈欢迎。

    新华社贵阳23日电　贵州省省级机关今年下放的一千五百八十多名干部，即将陆续到达基层。
    贵州省的广大干部今年再一次表现了热烈拥护党的干部下放政策。在省委动员后的一两天内，省级机关95％以上的干部都积极提出申请，热切地希望下放劳动锻炼。许多人希望至少有一年时间的锻炼，并且希望下放到边远山区艰苦的地方去锻炼。
    贵州省级机关今年的下放干部中，包括有省委常委，省委各部部长和省人民委员会厅局长以上干部三十三人。全部下放干部中，除了少数人是到基层担任职务，工业交通、财贸系统的干部分别到基层企业劳动以外，大多数干部都是下放到人民公社进行劳动锻炼，如参加田间劳动，当饲养员、炊事员、保育员、工厂工人等。下放干部除参加各项生产劳动外，还将成为巩固人民公社、开展技术革新、开展红旗竞赛等各项运动中的积极力量。
    新华社兰州23日电　甘肃省决定从省、专区、县三级机关抽调一千多名县级以上的干部下放到人民公社，使全省五百四十四个人民公社都能配备一个到五个领导干部。省级机关第一批下放的八十九名干部，将在2月底到达工作岗位。他们中49％作过县委书记、县长和基层工作，受到革命锻炼的时间一般都较长。第一批从专区、县抽调的干部，也大部分是部、局长，县委书记和县长，他们已经到公社担任职务。
    中共甘肃省委第一书记张仲良19日同省级机关首批下放到公社工作的干部谈了话。他说：从去年的实践中可以看出，下放干部对促进1958年各项工作的发展起了很大的作用，是去年大跃进的因素之一。把干部下放到基层，使他们能上能下，既能工作，又能劳动和学习，这样就能锻炼出一批经得起任何风险的共产主义干部。他勉励大家在实际锻炼中加强自我改造，逐步地达到又红又专，在实际工作中要运用辩证法，要研究、掌握、并熟练地运用客观事物的发展规律，力争今年更大更好更全面的跃进，更好地完成和超额完成各项生产指标。
