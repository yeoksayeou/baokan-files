Seize the Opportunity
Zhang Ke

Doing anything requires seizing the opportune moment. Agricultural production is highly seasonal, making seizing the moment especially crucial. Taking the initiative in one step makes it easier to take the initiative in every step; being passive in one step makes it easier to be passive in every step. Grasping the next month or two to do well in winter production and spring plowing preparations is an important key to striving for an even greater harvest this year than in 1958. By no means should we miss the opportunity!

In summing up the experience of the 1958 bumper harvest, people deeply realized that last year’s great agricultural harvest mainly relied on later-stage processing; if the innate conditions had been sufficient, the results would have been even greater. This year, the winter crops in many regions have implemented measures such as deep plowing, close planting, and applying more base fertilizer during planting, and the innate conditions are much better than last year. What is urgently needed now is to strengthen field management. If work such as topdressing, weeding, irrigation, and pest and disease control can keep up closely, a greater summer harvest will be even more assured. After achieving a great summer harvest, whether in terms of manpower or material resources, the overall arrangement of the year's production will be more proactive.

Work such as accumulating fertilizer, repairing water conservancy, improving soil, and reforming and repairing tools should also be fully prepared in winter, so as to avoid being caught off guard and having to scramble for them at the last minute.

There are so many things to seize and do, and the time, in the south, is only about a month away from spring plowing, and in the north, it is no more than two months. In order not to miss the opportunity, we must distinguish between the important and the urgent, do the urgent things first, and the slow things later or not at all for the time being; allocate more strength to the key points, and relatively reduce the strength for the non-key points. As for what should be slow and what should be urgent, who is the key point and who is not the key point, it is not the same in any region or at any time. From a national perspective, the "most urgent task" of current agricultural production is to strive for a great summer harvest, which is to strengthen the field management of winter crops. And the most important issue in management is the fertilizer issue. Therefore, solving the fertilizer problem has become the most urgent and most important task of the entire national agricultural production front. All localities should promptly organize forces, rationally arrange and use labor, and strengthen the fertilizer front. The practice of the Longyan Special Zone in Fujian is correct. This special zone ranks all industrial and agricultural production tasks according to their importance and urgency, and first focuses on agriculture, deciding to invest more than 70% of the labor force in agricultural production, and uses its main strength to accumulate and produce fertilizer. In this way, the focus is prominent, the key points are clear, which can not only ensure the timely completion of the fertilizer accumulation plan, but also ensure that other spring production that is urgently needed is guaranteed in terms of labor, laying a reliable foundation for this year's overall leap forward.

    抓时机
    张克
    办事都要掌握时机。农业生产有很大的季节性，特别需要掌握时机。一步主动，就容易步步主动；一步被动，就容易步步被动。抓紧今后一两个月的时间，做好冬季生产和春耕准备工作，是争取今年比1958年获得更大丰收的重要关键。千万不可错过时机！
    在总结1958年丰收经验的时候，人们深深体会到：去年农业生产上的大丰收的获得主要靠后期加工；如果先天足，成绩还会更大。今年许多地区的越冬作物在种植时贯彻执行了深耕、密植、多施基肥等措施，先天条件比去年好得多。现在迫切需要的是加强田间管理。如果追肥、除草、灌溉、防治病虫害等工作能紧紧跟上，夏季更大的丰收便更有把握。取得了夏季大丰收以后，无论就人力上或者是物力上来说，全年生产的全面安排就能更加主动。
    积肥、修水利、改良土壤和改革、修制工具等工作，也都要在冬季作好充分准备，以免临时现抓，措手不及。
    要抓紧办的事情这么多，而时间呢，在南方离春耕只有一个月左右，北方也不过两个月。为了不失时机，就必须分清轻重缓急，急的先办，缓的后办或者暂时不办；重点的多配备些力量，非重点就可以相对地减少一些力量。至于何者当缓，何者当急，谁是重点，谁非重点，并不是任何地区、任何时候都一样的。从全国来说，当前农业生产的“当务之急”是争取夏季大丰收，是加强越冬作物的田间管理。而管理中的最重要的问题又是肥料问题。因此，解决肥料问题就成了全国整个农业生产战线一个最紧急最主要的任务。各地都应该及时地组织力量，合理地安排和使用劳动力，加强肥料战线。福建龙岩专区的作法是对的，这个专区对工农业各项生产，按轻重缓急加以排队，首先大抓农业，决定以70％以上的劳动力投入农业生产，并以主要力量积肥造肥，这样就中心突出，重点明确，既能保证积肥计划按期完成，而急需的其他春季生产在劳力方面也得到了保证，为今年的全面的跃进打下了可靠的基础。
