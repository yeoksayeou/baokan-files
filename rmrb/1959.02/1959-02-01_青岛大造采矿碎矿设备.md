According to the Qingdao Daily News, in order to guarantee the needs of the rapidly developing iron and steel industry for iron ore, the Qingdao General Machinery Factory, the Lao Ya American Metrology Factory, and others are manufacturing large quantities of drilling machines, air compressors, ammonium nitrate explosives machines, ore pulverizers and other mining and rock drilling equipment and ore crushing equipment.

In the fourth quarter of last year, the Qingdao Mechanical Industry Bureau began to arrange the manufacturing tasks for the aforementioned machinery. The 40-horsepower air compressor manufactured by Qingdao General Machinery Factory is an indispensable power tool for replacing manual mining and rock drilling. The complete set of ammonium nitrate explosives machinery manufactured by the factory together with Rubber Factory No. 6 and Sifang Chemical Factory can be used to produce a large number of explosives and detonators for blasting rocks. The 15-horsepower ore pulverizer manufactured by Lao Ya American Metrology Factory and other units can meet the needs of two 13-cubic-meter small blast furnaces with the ore crushed by one machine.

In the process of manufacturing the above-mentioned machinery and equipment, the workers of various factories overcame difficulties such as low technical capabilities and insufficient equipment. In the case of insufficient technical force in the Fifth Workshop of the General Machinery Factory, it relied on the masses to distribute a large number of drawings to the workshop groups, allowing workers to learn and manufacture at the same time. With the collective wisdom and efforts of the masses, many key problems were readily solved. Technicians and workers of the Lao Ya American Metrology Factory jointly created five homemade shapers and special turning tools, solving the problem that the ore pulverizer could not be processed due to the lack of large machine tools.

    青岛大造采矿碎矿设备
    据青岛日报消息　为了保证钢铁工业加速发展对铁矿石的需要，青岛市通用机械厂、老亚美度量衡厂等，正在大量制造钻探机、空气压缩机、硝氨炸药机、矿石粉碎机等采矿凿岩设备和矿石破碎设备。
    去年第四季度，青岛机械工业局即开始安排上述机械的制造任务。青岛通用机械厂制造的四十马力空气压缩机是代替人力采矿凿岩不可缺少的动力工具。该厂和橡胶六厂、四方化工厂一起制造的成套硝氨炸药机械，可用以生产大量炸药雷管，供炸石使用。老亚美度量衡厂等单位制造的十五马力矿石粉碎机，一台机器破碎的矿石就可满足两座十三立方公尺小高炉的需要。
    在制造上述机械设备过程中，各厂职工克服了技术能力低和设备不足等困难。通用机械厂五车间在技术力量不足的情况下，依靠群众，将大量图纸下放到车间小组，让工人边学习边制造。在群策群力之下，许多关键问题迎刃而解。老亚美度量衡厂技术人员和工人一起造出了土牛头刨等五台土刨床和旋制专用工具，解决了因缺少大型机床不能加工矿石粉碎机的问题。
