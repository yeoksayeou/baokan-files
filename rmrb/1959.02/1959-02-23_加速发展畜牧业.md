The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on certain issues concerning the people's communes pointed out that while vigorously solving the grain problem and increasing the production of industrial raw material crops, we must "pay great attention to accelerating the development of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries" and "bring about an all-out revolution in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and thoroughly change the face of the entire agricultural front." The National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Socialist Construction Units warmly responded to the Party's call and, in its "Ten Initiatives," in addition to demanding the guarantee of completing this year's grain and cotton production increase targets and the production increase plans for industrial raw material crops, also "called for the output value of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in 1959 to increase by about 100% compared to 1958." This is the guideline and task for our country's entire agricultural front this year. Today, we will focus on one of the important aspects—the development of animal husbandry.

In 1958, under the new situation of the overall Great Leap Forward, China's animal husbandry, like the entire agricultural production, also had a Great Leap Forward. The growth rate of pigs, sheep, and large livestock greatly exceeded the average annual growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan. However, from a global perspective, animal husbandry is still a weak link in agricultural production, and the development of animal husbandry is far from meeting the needs of industrial and agricultural production and people's lives. Therefore, sufficient attention must be paid to the development of animal husbandry.

We should not view anything in isolation, and the same applies to animal husbandry. It is not isolated in our entire economic life, and it also has a close relationship with other parts of the entire agricultural front. To correctly solve the problem of developing animal husbandry, we must understand this interrelationship.

In broad agriculture, there are two major production sectors: one is plant cultivation, which is the planting of food crops, oil crops, industrial raw material crops, vegetables, etc.; the other is animal breeding, which is the raising of cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, poultry, etc. These two sectors are interdependent and mutually supportive. Planting provides animal husbandry with forage and feed, and animal husbandry supports planting with power (draught animals) and fertilizer (livestock manure). Among the two sectors, planting (narrow agriculture) is more important and is the foundation of animal husbandry; without developed planting, there will be no developed animal husbandry. However, we must not ignore the other side: without developed animal husbandry, agricultural development will also be affected to a certain extent; in certain periods and under certain conditions, this influence may be particularly prominent. This issue is particularly pressing in China at present.

Taking agricultural power as an example, in 1958, the national mechanized farming area accounted for only about 2% of the total cultivated land area. This means that about 98% of the cultivated land is still cultivated by livestock. Even on mechanized land, many farm tasks are still inseparable from animal power. Since the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in China, farm work has greatly increased; coupled with the overall development of the rural economy and the unprecedentedly busy exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, the transportation industry has also greatly developed. At present, the transportation capacity in rural areas is basically still animal power. Therefore, many areas feel a severe shortage of animal power. Massively breeding draught animals and enhancing agricultural power are particularly pressing in the greater leap forward in agricultural production in China. Of course, with the continuous development of China's industry, the level of agricultural mechanization and electrification will increase year by year. However, full mechanization and electrification will take a certain process. At present, a large number of deep plows and various new farm tools still use draught animals as power. It should also be noted that even after full agricultural mechanization in the future, draught animals will still be indispensable auxiliary power for a considerable period of time.

Taking fertilizer as an example, it is nothing more than two major categories: one is organic fertilizer; the other is inorganic fertilizer. The latter's output will greatly increase with the development of the chemical industry. However, this also takes a certain amount of time. More noteworthy is that livestock manure, as an organic fertilizer, is necessary for agricultural production increase at any time and cannot be replaced by inorganic fertilizers. Experience has long proven that chemical fertilizers must be used in combination with organic fertilizers; otherwise, good results will not be achieved; moreover, long-term use of inorganic fertilizers alone will deteriorate the soil. To establish fertilizer bases and open up regular fertilizer sources, the most important item is to massively raise livestock. One pig, one cow, and one sheep are all small "fertilizer factories." According to the materials from eleven key counties in the 1957 National Pig Raising Conference, each pig can accumulate 40 dan of fertilizer per year, and the fertilizer effect is equivalent to 60 jin of ammonium sulfate, which can increase grain production by 200 jin to 300 jin when applied to the land. Historically, high-yield grain areas have mostly been areas with higher livestock density. This is certainly because more grain can raise more livestock; conversely, more livestock means more fertilizer, which can produce more grain.

Animal husbandry is also closely related to light industry. Only when animal husbandry is developed can light industries that use animal products as raw materials (such as the wool textile industry, meat and dairy processing industries, the leather industry, etc.) be developed accordingly. At present, China's wool textile industry cannot fully utilize its equipment due to insufficient supply of wool raw materials. Other related factories have similar situations. To change this situation, animal husbandry must be developed at high speed.

Animal products are important and marketable export commodities. In the eight years from 1950 to 1957, if the total value of China's exported animal products were all converted into steel, it could be exchanged for more than 10 million tons. This is a very considerable number. Accelerating the development of animal husbandry and expanding foreign trade can not only exchange for the materials needed for China's socialist construction, but also benefit the cause of world peace.

The development of animal husbandry is of particularly great significance for directly meeting the needs of people's lives. The development of animal husbandry in the people's communes, in addition to providing more raw materials to factories producing daily necessities, can also directly supply more meat, eggs and other non-staple foods to cities and industrial and mining areas. This increases the income of the communes and strengthens mutual assistance between urban and rural areas. At the same time, the abundance of meat, eggs, and daily industrial products made from animal products can greatly improve the lives of commune members. In the past, due to the underdeveloped animal husbandry, the consumption level of animal products among the Chinese people was very low. We must never be satisfied with this state. Even if there is enough food and cotton cloth to eat and wear, we must continue to improve our lives, so that the people of the whole country eat better and dress better. When the meat problem has not been completely solved, it cannot be considered that China's food problem has been completely solved. China is a large country with more than 600 million people. Without even considering the future increase in population, calculated only on the basis of the current population: if each person eats an average of four ounces of meat a day, more than 60 billion jin will be needed in a year; calculated on the basis of 100 jin of net meat per pig, more than 600 million pigs will have to be slaughtered; to slaughter so many pigs every year, the number of pigs in stock at the end of the year must be nearly one billion. If each person eats two eggs a day, more than 400 billion eggs will be needed in a year; calculated on the basis of 180 eggs laid by a hen in a year, more than 2 billion hens must be raised. If everyone in the country wears a pair of leather shoes, and everyone in the northern regions wears a sweater, that is more than one billion pieces. What a huge number this is! How can we not pay great attention to the development of animal husbandry and create abundant animal products! Of course, with the development of the chemical industry, a considerable part of the need for fur can be replaced by synthetic materials; however, in any case, all meat and some fur must be supplied by animal husbandry. If this is neglected, it will not take long before we will be in a passive situation in this regard as other aspects of production develop and the living standards of the broad masses of the people improve. We should foresee this, work hard early, and strive for initiative.

With such significant and urgent significance in developing animal husbandry, can China's animal husbandry be rapidly and massively developed?

China has favorable conditions for developing animal husbandry. In terms of nature, China has vast pastoral areas, abundant grasslands, and many grasslands that have not yet been utilized, with great potential. For example, the grassland area in the northern high-altitude and cold pastoral areas is about 3.6 million square kilometers, with only more than 45 million livestock, only a little more than 12 animals per square kilometer, and it can be developed many times over. Mountains account for more than half of China's area, and general mountainous areas are most suitable for diversified operations, which can greatly develop animal husbandry. However, these naturally rich material resources have not yet been fully utilized. The subtropical south also has superior conditions for developing animal husbandry, where it is evergreen in all seasons or green in three seasons, with abundant water and grass. According to materials provided by relevant parties, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has 60 million mu of pasture, Guizhou Province has 160 million mu, and Yunnan has 190 million mu, but the existing number of livestock is not large.

In terms of social conditions, China's socialist system, especially the people's commune system, has opened up infinitely broad prospects for the development of animal husbandry and created the most fundamental favorable conditions. The people's communes can specialize animal husbandry production, which makes it possible for animal husbandry to break away from the past decentralized and backward state and move towards a path of high-speed development. In the past, many agricultural cooperatives were small in scale, and there were many things that could not be done or were not easy to do in animal husbandry production, such as implementing group and classified breeding of livestock, promoting scientific breeding management and epidemic prevention methods, and carrying out some larger animal husbandry infrastructure construction. Now that the communes have been established, all of these can be done. The people's communes in pastoral areas have also shown great advantages. With the establishment of the communes, herdsmen have settled down more and more, ending their nomadic lives, and a new atmosphere of prosperity for both people and livestock has emerged.

There is another condition for developing animal husbandry now that is even more favorable than in the past: the supply of feed has increased. Previously, the increase in grain production was not large, and in order to take care of the people's needs for staple food as much as possible, the feed for livestock had to be appropriately controlled, and the development of animal husbandry could not but be affected to a certain extent. In 1958, China's grain output greatly increased, and while appropriately increasing staple food, seeds, and reserve grain, it also increased a lot of feed. In 1959, China's grain output will reach 1050 billion jin, and most areas can achieve an average of 2000 jin of grain per person. With this output target achieved, it will be possible to take out more grain as livestock feed while further meeting the needs of expanding reproduction, staple food needs, and reserves. People's consumption of grain is always limited; the more grain production increases, the more abundant the feed for livestock will be. After a certain period, as meat, eggs, etc., increase, people's consumption of grain may also decrease. This makes it possible to use more feed to develop animal husbandry. This is one of the long-term goals and ways to improve life. We must move step by step towards such a path.

To give full play to these favorable conditions and turn the possibility of accelerating the development of animal husbandry into reality, we also need to be good at using these favorable conditions, and we also need to go all out and give full play to human subjective initiative. At present, we must pay special attention to properly resolving the following aspects of the problem:

First of all, the issue of the operating policy of animal husbandry. Large livestock such as cattle, horses, donkeys, and mules are important means of agricultural production. During the period of running agricultural production cooperatives, they have already been transformed from private ownership to collective ownership by agricultural cooperatives. This is in line with production needs. After communization, large livestock should still continue to be owned, raised, and bred by the commune. Individual members generally do not need to raise large livestock. Before communization, most of the pigs were privately raised, and many of the sheep were also privately raised. After communization, the policy of public raising as the mainstay and private raising as a supplement should be adopted. Because the people's communes not only carry out collective production, but also implement the collectivization of life, the conditions for raising members' families have undergone great changes. There are difficulties in the collection of green feed, the utilization of swill, and the allocation of labor time. It is no longer possible to rely mainly on private raising as in the past, while public raising has very favorable conditions. Therefore, collective raising by communes should be actively developed, and various livestock farms should be run on a large scale. Communes, management districts (or production brigades), and production teams can all establish farms, and public canteens should also raise livestock. This can rapidly develop the commune's animal husbandry, increase the collective ownership component, and consolidate the people's communes economically. This is undoubtedly the direction of future development. However, on the other hand, it should also be seen that the communes have not been established for a long time, have not accumulated experience in collective raising, and the equipment required for collective and specialized animal husbandry cannot be set up all at once. Therefore, at present, while vigorously developing the collective animal husbandry of the communes, members' families must also be allowed to raise livestock and poultry on the premise that it does not hinder commune attendance and collective production, and convenience should be provided in the collection of green feed, the supply of refined feed, and the arrangement of labor time. Especially in terms of raising poultry, the enthusiasm of members' families should be given full play, and raising by every family and every household should be promoted; in this way, even if each household raises some, the national total will be more than one billion. Raising poultry by members' families only requires scattering some feed in the morning and evening, and greeting them when returning home after finishing work. It does not take up labor and can increase members' income. There are many benefits.

Secondly, the issue of labor arrangement. To massively develop animal husbandry in the people's communes, a professional team is indispensable. While first ensuring the completion of this year's main production targets for grain, cotton, oil, hemp, etc., we must also achieve overall consideration, arrange a certain proportion of labor for each industry in the commune, including animal husbandry, and strive to fix it. Unless there are major shock tasks, do not easily transfer them. In addition to ensuring that there is a certain number of laborers engaged in animal husbandry, attention should also be paid to the quality of the labor force. A group of Party members and Youth League member backbones must be selected and supplemented into the animal husbandry production sector. At the same time, the combination of strong and weak labor must be appropriate. Many jobs in breeding are suitable for women and weak labor; however, it is also necessary to maintain a certain proportion of strong labor. It is also necessary to earnestly pay attention to improving the labor organization of animal husbandry, reforming animal husbandry tools, and improving labor efficiency. On the basis of the reform of animal husbandry tools, the mechanization and electrification of pastoral production should be gradually realized.

Thirdly, the issue of feed arrangement. The refined feed required by livestock should be uniformly allocated and supplied from grain. At present, many areas have not arranged this well. In the 1958 grain year, the total output of potatoes in our country reached 700 billion jin, and some places are not well preserved, and there is a risk of spoilage. They should be quickly taken out to feed pigs and raise poultry, so that pigs can grow more fat and poultry can lay more eggs. Attention should also be paid to solving the problem of forage. First, the straw used as feed, fertilizer, fuel, and sideline raw materials should be taken into overall consideration and properly arranged. All straw that can be used as forage must be collected, stored, and utilized, and the silage feed should be widely promoted; second, the use of land retired from cultivation should be used as much as possible to plant pasture and increase forage production. For crops that can be used as green manure and also as feed, they should also be properly arranged to strive for the most rational use; third, wild grass should be harvested and stored in a timely manner; fourth, feed and forage must be planted in pastoral areas. Through the above fundamental measures, a solid feed base should be gradually established.

Party committees at all levels must strengthen their leadership over animal husbandry. First of all, we must grasp the plan. The net increase rate of large livestock in 1959 should reach about 10%. The reproduction of pigs and sheep must also ensure the completion of the national plan, with both a certain net increase rate and a certain amount of market supply; pigs must be fattened to ensure that the slaughtered fat pigs weigh no less than 150 jin in gross weight and no less than 100 jin in net meat. Specific plans must be made for the increased production of chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, eggs, etc. Secondly, the on-site conferences, comparison and competition, grasping both ends and bringing the middle, and other leadership methods that have been effective in the past year should be adopted to carry out the "Ten Major Raising" movement for raising cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, geese, and rabbits. Communes should raise them, teams should raise them, households should raise them, villages should raise them, cities should raise them, factories should raise them, and organs should raise them. All those who have the conditions to raise should raise them to create a mass movement for the development of animal husbandry by the whole people.

At present, the season for livestock mating and mass incubation of chicks is coming soon. Doing a good job in mating and incubation is as important as doing a good job in spring plowing and sowing in planting. This is an important key to completing the task of developing animal husbandry for the whole year. We must seize the opportunity and do a good job in preparing from all aspects to lay a good foundation for greatly improving the conception rate of female livestock and the survival rate of chicks.

In order to promote greater development of industrial and agricultural production, in order for the people of the whole country to eat more meat, eggs, dairy products, wear more fur products, and live a more fulfilling life, let us, according to the call of the Party Central Committee, pay great attention to accelerating the development of animal husbandry! We believe that this year China's animal husbandry will definitely develop faster and better.

### 加速发展畜牧业

    加速发展畜牧业
    党的八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议中指出：在大力解决粮食问题和增产工业原料作物的同时，要“极大地注意加速林业、畜牧业、副业和渔业的发展”“要在农林牧副渔五业中来一个全线大革命，彻底改变整个农业战线的面貌”。全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议热烈响应党的号召，在“十大倡议”中，除了要求保证完成今年的粮、棉增产指标和工业原料作物的增产计划以外，还“要求1959年林业、畜牧业、副业和渔业的产值比1958年增加一倍左右”。这就是今年我国整个农业战线的方针和任务。今天，我们来着重谈谈其中的一个重要方面——发展畜牧业的问题。
    1958年，在全面大跃进的新形势下，我国畜牧业和整个农业生产一样也有一个大跃进。猪、羊和大家畜的增长速度大大超过了第一个五年计划期间平均每年增长的速度。但是，从全局看来，畜牧业仍然是农业生产中的一个薄弱环节，畜牧业的发展还远不能适应工农业生产和人民生活的需要。因此，必须对畜牧业的发展给予足够的注意。
    我们对任何事物都不可孤立地看待，对畜牧业也是这样。它在我们的整个经济生活中不是孤立的，在整个农业战线上也同其他部分有密切的关系。要正确地解决发展畜牧业的问题，就不能不了解这种相互关系。
    在广义的农业中，有两大生产部门：一个是植物栽培，就是种植粮食作物、油料作物、工业原料作物、蔬菜等等；一个是动物饲养，就是喂养牛、马、猪、羊、家禽等等。这两个部门是彼此依存互相支援的。种植业向畜牧业提供饲草、饲料，畜牧业以动力（役畜）肥料（牲畜粪便）支援种植业。在两个部门之中，种植业（狭义的农业）是比较重要的，是畜牧业的基础；没有发达的种植业，就不会有发达的畜牧业。但是，也不能忽视另外一面：没有发达的畜牧业，农业的发展也会受到一定的影响；在一定的时期，一定的条件下，这种影响还可能特别突出。这个问题，在我国，在目前，就显得特别迫切。
    拿农业的动力来讲，1958年全国机耕面积仅占总耕地面积的2％左右。这也就是说：还有98％左右的耕地是用牲畜耕种的。在机耕的土地上，有不少农活仍然离不开畜力。我国农业生产大跃进以来，农活大大增加了；再加以农村经济的全面发展，城乡物资交流的空前繁忙，运输业也大大发展了。目前农村的运输力量，基本上仍是畜力。因此，许多地区极感畜力不足。大量繁植役畜，增强农业动力，在我国农业生产更大跃进中就显得特别迫切。当然，随着我国工业的不断发展，农业的机械化电气化水平是会逐年提高的。但是，全盘的机械化电气化要经过一定的过程。目前，大量的深耕犁和各种新式农具，仍然是以役畜作动力的。还要看到，到将来农业全盘机械化以后，在相当长的时期内，役畜仍然是不可缺少的辅助动力。
    拿肥料来讲，不外是两大类：一类是有机质肥料；一类是无机质肥料。后者随着化学工业的发展，产量是会大大增长的。然而，这也需要一定的时间。更值得注意的是：作为有机质肥料的牲畜粪便，在任何时候都是农业增产所必需的，是无机质肥料不能替代的。经验早已证明，化学肥料必须和有机肥料配合使用；否则，就收不到良好的效果；而且，长期单纯使用无机肥料，还会使土壤变坏。我们要建立肥料基地，开辟经常的肥料来源，其中最重要的一项就是大量饲养牲畜。一口猪，一头牛，一只羊都是一个小“肥料工厂”。根据1957年全国养猪会议上十一个重点县的材料，每头猪一年可积肥料四十担，肥效相当于六十斤硫酸氨，施到地里可增产二百斤到三百斤粮食。历史上的粮食高产地区，大都是牲畜密度较大的地区。这固然是由于粮食多了可以多养牲畜；反过来，牲畜多了肥料也多，就可以多打粮食。
    畜牧业同轻工业也有密切的关系。只有畜牧业发展了，以畜产品作原料的轻工业（如毛纺工业、肉类奶类加工工业、皮革工业，等等）才能相应地发展起来。目前，我国的毛纺工业，就因为羊毛原料供应不足，设备不能充分利用。其他有关的工厂也有类似的情况。要改变这种局面，就不能不高速度地发展畜牧业。
    畜产品是重要的畅销的出口物资。由1950年到1957年的八年间，我国出口的畜产品总值如果都换钢材的话，约可换一千多万吨。这是一个非常可观的数字。加速发展畜牧业，扩大对外贸易，既可以换回我国社会主义建设所需要的物资，又有益于世界和平事业。
    畜牧业的发展对于直接满足人民生活的需要更有特别重大的意义。人民公社的畜牧业发展了，除了供应生产日用品的工厂以更多的原料以外，还可以直接向城市和工矿区供应更多的肉类、蛋品等副食品。这样，既增加了公社的收入，又加强了城乡的互助。同时，肉类、蛋品和用畜产品制造的日用工业品丰富了，也可以大大地改善公社社员的生活。以往，由于畜牧业还不发达，我国人民对于畜产品的消费水平是很低的。我们决不能满足于这种状态。即使粮食和棉布够吃、够穿了，我们也还要不断再求改善生活，让全国人民吃的更好，穿的更好。什么时候肉食问题还没有彻底解决，就不能认为我国的粮食问题已经彻底解决了。我国是六亿多人口的大国，暂不谈今后人口的增加，只按目前的人口计算：如果平均每人一天吃四两肉，一年就需要六百多亿斤；以每头猪净肉一百斤计算，就要宰六亿多头猪；每年要宰这么多猪，上年底存栏数就要有将近十亿头。每人一天吃两个鸡蛋，一年就需要四千多亿个；以一个母鸡一年下一百八十个蛋计算，就要饲养二十多亿只母鸡。如果全国每人穿一双皮鞋，北方各地人民每人穿一件毛衣，合起来就是十多亿件。这是多么巨大的数字！怎能不极大地注意发展畜牧业，创造丰富的畜产品！当然，随着化学工业的发展，对于皮毛方面的需要，可以有相当大的部分由合成材料代替；但是，无论如何，所有肉食和部分皮毛必须靠畜牧业来供应。如果在这方面疏忽了，不要很久的时间，随着其它各方面生产的发展和广大人民生活水平的提高，就会在这方面处于被动的局面。我们应当预见到这一点，早早努力，争取主动。
    发展畜牧业有这么重大而又迫切的意义，我国畜牧业究竟能不能迅速地大规模地发展呢？
    我国有发展畜牧业的有利条件。在自然方面，我国有广大的牧区，丰美的草地，有许多草地还没有利用，潜力很大。例如北方高寒牧区草原面积约三百六十多万平方公里，只有四千五百多万头牲畜，每一平方公里只有十二头多一些，还可以成倍地发展。我国山区面积占一半以上，一般山区最适宜多种经营，可以大大发展畜牧业。可是，这天然的丰富的物质资源，至今也还没有充分利用。南方亚热带也有发展畜牧业的优越条件，在那里是四季长青或者三季皆绿，水草并茂。据有关方面提供的材料，广西僮族自治区有牧场六千万亩，贵州省有一亿六千万亩，云南有一亿九千万亩，但现有的牲畜数量都不多。
    在社会条件方面，我国的社会主义制度，特别是人民公社制度，给发展畜牧业开辟了无限广阔的天地，创造了最根本的有利条件。人民公社可以使畜牧业生产专业化，这就有可能使畜牧业摆脱过去的分散落后状态，转向高速度发展的道路。过去许多农业社的规模较小，畜牧生产上有许多事不能办或者不易办，例如实行牲畜分群分类饲养，推行科学的饲养管理和防疫方法，进行一些较大的畜牧业的基本建设等。现在成立了公社，都可以办了。牧业区的人民公社也显示了很大的优越性。随着公社的建立，牧民更多的定居下来，结束了游牧生活，更多地出现了人畜两旺的新气象。
    现在发展畜牧业还有一个比过去更加有利的条件：饲料增加了。以前，粮食的增产还不多，为了尽量照顾到人民对口粮的需要，不得不对牲畜的饲料加以适当的控制，畜牧业的发展也就不能不受到一定的影响。1958年，我国的粮食产量大大增加了，在口粮、种籽和储备粮适当增加的同时，也增加了许多饲料。1959年我国粮食产量将达到一万零五百亿斤，大部分地区可以作到平均每人有二千斤粮食。达到了这个产量指标，就可能在进一步满足扩大再生产的需要、口粮需要和储备的需要的同时，拿出更多的粮食作为牲畜饲料。人对粮食的消费总是有一定限度的；粮食增产得越多，牲畜的饲料就会越丰富。到了一定的时期，肉食、蛋品等等增加了，人对粮食的消费还有可能减少。这就可以用更多的饲料发展畜牧业。这是改善生活的长远的奋斗目标和途径之一。我们要一步一步向这样的道路上走去。
    要使这些有利条件充分地发挥作用，要把加快发展畜牧业的可能性变成现实性，还需要善于运用这些有利条件，还需要鼓足干劲，充分发挥人的主观能动性。目前，要特别注意妥善解决以下几方面的问题：
    首先是畜牧业的经营方针问题。牛、马、驴、骡等大牲畜，是农业的重要生产资料，在办农业生产合作社的时期，就已经由私有转变为农业社集体所有。这是符合生产需要的。公社化以后，对大牲畜应该仍然继续采取由公社所有、由公社饲养、由公社繁殖的办法，社员个人一般没有必要饲养大牲畜。猪在公社化以前大部分是私养的，羊也有不少是私养的，公社化以后，应该采取公养为主、私养为辅的方针。因为人民公社不但集体进行生产，而且实行了生活集体化，社员家庭饲养条件发生了很大的变化，在青饲料的搜集、泔水的利用和劳动时间的支配等方面都有困难，再像过去那样主要依靠私人饲养已经不可能，而公社饲养又有很有利的条件。因此，应该积极发展公社集体饲养，大办各种家畜场，公社、管理区（或生产大队）和生产队都可以建立饲养场，公共食堂也要饲养。这样做，可以迅速发展公社畜牧业，增加集体所有制成分，从经济上巩固人民公社。这无疑地是今后的发展方向。但是，另一方面也要看到，公社建立起来的时间还不长，还没有积累起来集体饲养的经验，集体化、专业化的畜牧业所要求的设备也还不能一下子搞起来。因此，当前还必须在大力发展公社集体畜牧业的同时，在不妨碍公社出勤和集体生产的前提下，允许社员家庭饲养家畜家禽，并且在青饲料的搜集、精饲料的供应、劳动时间的安排等方面给以方便。特别在饲养家禽方面，要充分发挥社员家庭饲养的积极性，提倡家家养、户户养；这样每户都养一些，全国凑起来就是十几亿只。社员家庭养禽，早、晚撒几把饲料，干完活回家招呼一下就行了，可以不占用劳动力，又可以增加社员的收入，好处是很多的。
    其次是劳动力的安排问题。人民公社为了大规模地发展畜牧业，没有一支专业队伍是不行的。在首先保证今年粮、棉、油料、麻等主要生产指标完成的同时，还要作到全面兼顾，给公社里的其它各业，包括畜牧业在内，各安排一定比例的劳动力，力求固定，除非有了重大的突击任务，不要轻易调动。除了保证从事畜牧业的劳动力有一定数量以外，在劳动力的质量上也要注意。必须选派一批党员团员骨干，充实畜牧生产部门。同时要把劳动力强弱搭配适当。饲养业中许多工作是适宜于妇女和弱劳动力来干的；但也需要保持一定比例的强壮劳动力。还要切实注意改善畜牧业的劳动组织，改革畜牧用具，提高劳动效率。要在畜牧工具改革的基础上，逐步实现牧业生产的机械化、电气化。
    再次是饲料的安排问题。牲畜所需的精饲料，要由粮食中统一调剂供应。目前，许多地区对这还没有很好地安排。1958年粮食年度我国的薯类总产量达到七千几百亿斤，有些地方保存得不好，有坏掉的危险，应该快拿出来喂猪、养禽，使猪更多长肥，使家禽更多产蛋。对饲草问题也要注意解决。第一、对作为饲料、肥料、燃料和副业原料的秸秆要统筹兼顾，妥善安排。要收贮利用一切可作饲草的秸秆，并普遍推广青贮饲料；第二、尽可能利用退耕地种植牧草，增加饲草产量，对于可作绿肥也可作饲料的作物，也要妥善安排，力求最合理地使用；第三、抓紧适宜季节打贮野草；第四、牧业区一定要种植饲草饲料。要通过以上各项根本性措施，逐步建立起巩固的饲料基地。
    各级党委必须加强对畜牧业的领导。首先要抓计划。1959年大牲畜的净增率要达到10％左右。猪羊的增殖也要保证完成国家计划，既要有一定的净增率，又要有一定的上市量；猪要喂肥，保证杀的肥猪，每头毛重不少于一百五十斤，净肉不少于一百斤。鸡、鸭、鹅、兔子、蛋品等等的增产，都要有具体计划。其次，要采取去年行之有效的现场会议，评比竞赛，抓两头带中间等等领导方法，开展养牛、马、驴、骡、猪、羊、鸡、鸭、鹅、兔的“十大养”运动，社社养，队队养，户户养，乡村养，城市养，工厂养，机关养，凡有条件养的都养，掀起一个全民发展畜牧业的群众运动。
    目前，牲畜配种的季节和大量孵育雏禽的季节很快就要到来。做好配种和孵育工作，正像在种植业方面做好春耕播种工作一样重要。这是完成全年发展畜牧业的任务的重要关键。必须抓紧时机，从各方面做好准备工作，为大大提高母畜满怀率和雏禽成活率打下很好的基础。
    为了促进工农业生产更大的发展，为了全国人民早日吃更多的肉食、蛋品、乳品，穿更多的皮毛制品，生活过得更加美满，让我们按照党中央的号召，极大地注意加速畜牧业的发展吧！我们相信，今年我国的畜牧业一定会更快更好地发展起来。
