"Black Gold River" Suite
Gobi Boat

Preface

Waters shallow and deep,
Mountains near and far,
Green bamboo reflects red flags,
Derricks connect to the blue sky.

"Black Gold River" crosses the Min River,
Crosses the Tuo River,
Crosses the Fu River,
Crosses the Jialing River.

The Jialing River flows torrentially,
How many stars have been added?
Rows of lights,
Rows of well sites,
Everywhere in the river,
Everywhere like crystal palaces.

Oh, the fifth great river of Sichuan,
The petroleum river – "Black Gold River"!

Petroleum City

Little Nanchong City,
Buildings tall, streets wide.
Standing on a tall building to look,
The great river connects to the high mountains,
Derricks come from the edge of the sky,
Chimneys enter the clouds.

Airplanes in the white clouds,
Cars on the green mountain peaks,
Oil tankers fly like arrows,
High waves surge with white sails.
Trains come quickly,
The oil sea is vast and boundless!

Underground palaces,
Seas of trees are vast,
Lights like strings of bright pearls;
Mountains undulate,
Lights like stars in the sky;
The great river is boundless,
Lights like fishing fires are brilliant.

The Jialing River stretches for a thousand miles,
Drill tower lights shine on both banks.
Every drill tower,
Every treasure house door,
Leads to the underground palace.

The Well Site is a Battlefield

The drilling platform roars like thunder,
The pump room whips up a storm,
Searchlights flash,
Mud splatters like heavy rain.

High mountains cannot stand firm,
The great river dares not move,
The sun is dim in the daytime,
The sky is red at night.

The well site is a battlefield,
Drillers subdue giant dragons.

Whose Eyes are the Brightest

Whose eyes are the brightest in the sky?
It must be the eagle in the white clouds;
Whose eyes are the brightest on the ground?
It must be our petroleum workers.

The eyes of petroleum workers,
Can see through mysterious strata.

Whose Giant Hands

Wind high, clouds low,
Iron towers stand as tall as the sky.
Whose giant hands are these?
Thousands of meters,
Reaching into the oil sea,
Stirring up waves,
Roaring like thunder and rain.

Relying on thousands of giant hands,
We will plow ten thousand miles of land;
Relying on thousands of giant hands,
We will build an iron wall for national defense.

    “黑金江”组诗
    戈壁舟序诗深深浅浅水，远远近近山，绿竹映红旗，井架接蓝天。“黑金江”跨过岷江跨过沱江跨过涪江跨到嘉陵江。嘉陵江水滔滔，添了多少星光？行行灯火，排排井场，处处江水里，处处水晶宫模样哦，四川第五条大川，石油河——“黑金江”！石油城小小南充市，楼高街又宽。立在高楼望，大江连高山，井架天边来，烟囱入云端。飞机白云里，汽车青山巅，油船飞如箭，浪高涌白帆。火车快快来，油海大无边！地下宫殿树海浩瀚，灯火似明珠成串；山峦起伏，灯火似星光在天；大江茫茫，灯火似渔火灿烂。嘉陵江千里，钻塔灯辉两岸。座座钻塔，座座宝库门，通向地下宫殿。
  井场是战场钻台雷声吼，泵房刮暴风，探照灯打闪，泥浆大雨冲。高山立不稳，大江不敢动，白天日头昏，黑夜天空红。井场是战场，钻工降巨龙。谁的眼睛最亮天上谁的眼睛最亮？要数白云上的鹰；地上谁的眼睛最亮？要数咱石油工人。石油工人的眼睛，能看穿神秘地层。
  谁的巨手风高云低，铁塔与天齐。是谁的巨手？几千公尺，伸向油海里，卷起浪涛，吼声如雷雨。凭千百只巨手，要翻万里耕地；凭千百只巨手，要建成国防铁壁。
