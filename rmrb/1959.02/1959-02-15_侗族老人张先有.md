Dong Elder Zhang Xianyou

Under the care and advice of the commune cadres, the number of elderly people at the Rongjiang County Guzhou People's Commune water conservancy construction site gradually decreased. However, at the Chejiang Irrigation Canal construction site, there was an elderly Dong "Gelao" (a respectful term for elders in the Dong ethnic group) nearing sixty years old who, together with the young people, was carrying soil and mud in the cold wind. Despite his age, his enthusiasm was no less than that of the young people. A load of fifty or sixty *jin* of mud seemed like nothing on his shoulders.

Zhang Xianyou, fifty-nine years old, is a well-known "jack-of-all-trades" in the Zaima work area of the commune. Although he is relatively old and somewhat hard of hearing, he always puffs out his chest and says "I'll go!" whenever something benefits production or the collective, and takes the lead in getting started. This time, during the water conservancy construction, the commune originally didn't want him to go to take care of the elderly, but the old man insisted, so the commune had to let this old general go into action.

From the establishment of mutual aid teams to the communization, Zhang Gelao has been a model of loving the collective and socialism. Every day, in addition to completing his assigned production tasks, he would go out with a manure basket before dawn to collect manure for fertilizer. In 1958, he collected more than 10,000 *jin* of manure. Almost all of the base fertilizer used for planting rapeseed in the old man's team came from Zhang Xianyou, but he never asked the commune for work points. Whether going to work on the hillside or returning home from work, his shoulders were never idle. He would either chop a load of firewood for the canteen or cut a load of grass for the livestock keepers, and he refused to accept a single work point. Several times he got angry because he felt that the team had assessed "too many" work points for him. Despite this, his labor work points in the production team have always been the highest for many years.

During the great steelmaking campaign in September of last year, he stayed by the charcoal kiln day and night. Once, the charcoal in the iron smelting furnace ran out, and it looked like a furnace of molten iron was about to be lost; however, the charcoal was still piping hot, and the charcoal kiln had not cooled down. At this time, Zhang Gelao unhesitatingly opened the door of the charcoal kiln and braved the high temperature to enter the kiln to carry charcoal. When he came out of the kiln, much of his beard and eyebrows had been burned off by the charcoal fire. Influenced by his selfless actions, other commune members also followed him into the kiln to carry charcoal, saving a furnace of molten iron.

Years of farming experience have not made this old man complacent. After liberation, he always actively implemented the advanced agricultural technologies promoted by the Party and the government. Taking the triangular close planting promoted by the commune this spring as an example, many Dong commune members, accustomed to sparse planting, found it troublesome and feared that dense planting would prevent the rice from growing, and their thinking was still resistant. Zhang Gelao, however, only feared that he could not hear clearly, so he went to the Party branch secretary and the commune director again, asking them to draw a sample for him to see. Afterwards, he started planting alone in the field, and it passed the inspection completely.

Zhang Xianyou is a poor peasant. Before liberation, he tilled the land for landlords and rich peasants, suffering all kinds of hardships. Before liberation, in order to avoid the Kuomintang reactionaries from conscripting his son into the army, he had to flee to the mountains dozens of miles away. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, life became happier day by day, and therefore production became more and more active. In the Zaima work area, the industrious and brave Zhang Xianyou has become a role model for the commune members to learn from. For several years, he has been selected as a production model for the county, district, township, and commune every year.

    侗族老人张先有
    柳杨森
    在公社干部的关怀、劝阻下，榕江县古州人民公社水利工地上的老人渐渐少了。但是，在车江灌溉渠工程工地上，却有一位年近花甲的侗族“格老”（侗族对老年人的尊称）和青年人一道，在寒风中挑土运泥。别看他人老，干劲却不弱于青年。五、六十斤一挑的泥巴，在他肩上好像不算一回事。
    五十九岁的张先有是公社栽麻工区著名的“样样管”。他虽然年纪比较大，耳朵又有些聋，但是不管什么事，只要对生产对集体有好处，他总是胸脯一挺，说声“我去！”就带头干开了。这次修水利，公社为了照顾老年人，本来没有让他去，老人却非去不可，公社只好让这位老将出马了。
    从建立互助组，直到公社化以后，这一长段时间里，张格老都是热爱集体、热爱社会主义的榜样。每天，除了完成规定的生产任务，他天不亮就提着一个粪筐去拣粪积肥。1958年他拣了一万多斤粪，老人所在的小队里种油菜用的基肥，几乎全是张先有的，但是他从来没有向社要过工分。不论上坡出工还是收工回家，他肩上从来没有闲过，不是给食堂砍一担柴，就是给饲养员割一挑草，也不肯接受一个工分。好几次他认为队里“多”评了工分给他而生气。虽然如此，多少年来他的劳动工分在生产队总是最多的。
    在去年9月大炼钢铁时，他整日整夜地守在炭窑旁，有一次炼铁炉的木炭烧光了，眼看一炉铁水就要受损失；而木炭还在热腾腾的，木炭窑又没有冷却。这时，张格老毫不犹豫地打开木炭窑的门，冒着高温进窑挑木炭，当他出窑时，胡子和眉毛被炭火烧去不少。在他这种奋不顾身的行动影响下，其他社员也跟着进窑挑木炭，救了一炉铁水。
    多年的耕作经验并没有使这个老人自满。解放后，只要是党和政府推广的先进农业技术，他总是积极贯彻执行。就以今春社里推广三角丛植来说，稀植惯了的侗族社员中，就有不少人一嫌麻烦，二怕密了不长谷，思想还有抵触。张格老却只怕听的不清楚，又走去找党支部书记和社主任，要他们画个样子看看。随后，他一个人在田里栽起来了，经检查完全合格。
    张先有是一个贫农，解放前给地主、富农种地，受尽千辛万苦，临解放前，为了躲避国民党反动派抓他儿子当壮丁，不得不逃到几十里外的深山中去。解放后，在共产党领导下，生活一天比一天幸福，因而生产愈来愈积极，在栽麻工区，勤劳勇敢的张先有成了社员们学习的榜样，几年来，他年年当选县、区、乡、社的生产模范。
