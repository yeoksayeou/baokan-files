    Get Metallurgical Coke Without Using Coking Coal
    ——Introducing Several Simple Coal Low-Temperature Dry Distillation Furnaces
  　Zhu Kangfu
    Both steelmaking and ironmaking require high-quality coke. Coke that meets the requirements of the metallurgical industry is generally called metallurgical coke. Metallurgical coke is made from coal suitable for coking at a high temperature of about 1,000 degrees Celsius. This process is generally called high-temperature coking or high-temperature dry distillation of coal.
    There are many types of coal. From the perspective of coking, the coal most suitable for making metallurgical coke is called "prime coking coal." Coal that can be appropriately mixed with prime coking coal for coking is called blending coal. China has abundant coal resources, but prime coking coal and blending coal are not particularly abundant and are not evenly distributed. Therefore, finding ways to use other types of coal to produce metallurgical coke is of great significance.
    Some types of coal, such as coal from Datong, Shanxi, are of good quality and contain little sulfur, phosphorus, and ash. However, under high-temperature coking conditions, they lack binding ability, and the coal particles cannot stick together to form coke blocks with sufficient strength for direct use in the metallurgical industry. Such coal can be dry distilled at a lower temperature of 500 to 600 degrees Celsius to extract the volatile matter it contains, resulting in what is called "semi-coke." This processing method is called low-temperature dry distillation of coal.
    Whether high-temperature coking or low-temperature dry distillation, both can recover coal tar and ammonia from the dry distillation gas, in addition to obtaining coke or semi-coke. The amount of high-temperature coal tar obtained from high-temperature coking is small. Generally, in large-scale foreign furnace production, the yield of high-temperature coal tar does not exceed 4%-5% of the raw coal. In the current indigenous methods, only about 1% can be obtained. The amount of low-temperature coal tar obtained from low-temperature dry distillation is much larger. Even with simple indigenous methods, it can often reach 70%-90% of the oil content of the raw coal. For example, if the raw coal contains 8% oil, 56 to 72 kilograms can be recovered per ton of raw coal, accounting for 5.6%-7.2% of the raw coal. Low-temperature coal tar is an important source of synthetic petroleum and also contains valuable chemical raw materials such as phenols and pyridine. Currently, units under the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and employees of simple low-temperature dry distillation factories in various regions are using the method of "low-temperature dry distillation, high-temperature treatment" to obtain more coal tar and good coke, which can be directly used in 28-cubic-meter blast furnaces for ironmaking. The remaining gas from dry distillation can also be used to generate electricity. In this way, low-temperature dry distillation can simultaneously produce metallurgical coke, synthetic petroleum, chemical raw materials, and fuel for power, becoming a good method for the comprehensive utilization of coal.
    Here are some indigenous and simple low-temperature dry distillation furnaces:
        I. Heap Dry Distillation
    Simply put, coal is piled into a rectangular heap. Fire is lit on top of the coal heap, and air is drawn through channels laid at the bottom of the heap. Because the temperature of the burning gas above is very high, the coal tar below is distilled out along with the gas, and the coal becomes semi-coke. The dry distillation gas passes through condensation and recovery equipment to recover coal tar and ammonia. The remaining gas is used as a general fuel or burned in a gas engine to drive a generator for power generation.
    The main equipment for heap dry distillation is only one air pump and one water pump. The rest are made of bricks, soil, earthenware pipes, large vats, and a small amount of cement and wood. It is easy to build and simple to operate, requiring little investment. A small heap dry distillation facility that produces 300 tons of low-temperature coal tar and about 3,000 to 4,000 tons of coke annually only costs about 4,000 yuan, suitable for people's communes to establish.
    The disadvantage of heap dry distillation is intermittent production. Each dry distillation requires first loading the heap and then discharging the coke after dry distillation. Therefore, it consumes more labor. Furthermore, the generated gas cannot be supplied continuously. At the same time, the amount of air entering the dry distillation heap is not easy to control, inevitably burning some coal tar and coke, reducing the yield of coke and coal tar.
    However, in heap dry distillation, it is entirely possible to combine the principles of low-temperature dry distillation and high-temperature coking without adding any equipment, thereby effectively improving the yield, especially improving the quality of coke to meet the requirements of blast furnace ironmaking. There are two methods that have been successfully tested:
    1. Gas Return to Heap (Gas-Fired Heap Dry Distillation)
    Part of the remaining gas after oil recovery is sent back to the dry distillation heap to burn inside the heap, increasing the heat and raising the temperature. In this way, the coal inside the heap first undergoes a low-temperature dry distillation process to recover a large amount of coal tar, followed by the removal of volatile matter at a higher temperature, improving the quality of the coke. Generally, gas return to the heap can increase the coal tar yield by 10% and the coke yield by 10% (both relative to the original yield). In particular, the residual volatile matter in the coke is greatly reduced, approaching that of metallurgical coke obtained by general indigenous coking methods.
    2. High-Temperature Smothered Coking
    After heap dry distillation is completed, the temperature of the coke in the heap is still high, around 500 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, there is still some coal left in the heap. If the water is not sprayed to quench the coke first, but the piping system is opened to allow air to enter the heap freely, it can cause more intense combustion, greatly increasing the temperature inside the heap (actually exceeding 900 degrees Celsius). After such high-temperature smothered coking for 10 to 12 hours, the coke can meet the requirements of blast furnace ironmaking, truly achieving the goal of "low temperature for more oil, high temperature for better coke."
    The coke obtained from smothered coking of heap dry distillation has been successfully used for ironmaking in the 20-cubic-meter blast furnace of Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the 28-cubic-meter blast furnace of Baoding First Machine Tool Plant, with very good results, exceeding the indicators of coke made by indigenous methods.
    The above two methods can be used simultaneously or only one can be used. They are not contradictory.
    II. Simple Low-Temperature Dry Distillation Furnaces - Gas-Fired Square and Round Dry Distillation Furnaces
    Although heap dry distillation using gas return to the heap and high-temperature smothered coking combines the principles of low-temperature dry distillation and high-temperature coking relatively well, the basic production equipment - the dry distillation heap - is still entirely indigenous, with the disadvantages of intermittent operation and high labor costs. To further implement the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, a continuous production, uniform product, and easily obtainable equipment and materials are needed. These are the simple gas-fired small square furnace and small round furnace. The production principles, production methods, and other production equipment of these two simple dry distillation furnaces are the same. The only difference is the shape of the furnace.
    The general structure of these two furnaces can be seen in the schematic diagrams. Coal is continuously added from the top of the furnace, and coke is raked out from the bottom of the furnace. The gas returned to the furnace enters from the bottom, and the combustion-supporting air enters from the middle and lower part of the furnace. The air and dry distillation gas are then drawn out from the top of the furnace, pass through the recovery system, enter the exhaust fan. Part of the gas then returns to the furnace for combustion. The remaining gas is continuously and uniformly produced as a byproduct, used as fuel or as a power source for generating electricity. A small square furnace that processes 12 tons of coal per day can generate 120 kilowatts of electricity in a balanced manner, and can supply more than 100 kilowatts to other users in addition to the power needed for its own operation.
    The common features of these simple gas-fired furnaces are: high coal tar yield, often around 90% of the theoretical oil yield, uniform coke and gas quality, easy adjustment and control of furnace temperature, and the ability to reach over 1,100 degrees Celsius to fully ensure coke quality. The thermal efficiency is high, production is continuous, and semi-mechanized operation can be used according to construction conditions, saving labor. As for the furnace itself, in addition to using a small amount of steel and a small number of ordinary refractory bricks and cement, the rest are still ordinary bricks, soil, lime, earthenware pipes, large vats, and wood. The mechanical equipment uses a very small blower to send in air, which is more than what's used in heap dry distillation.
    The small square furnace designed by the Coal Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has been built in large numbers in the Northeast region, and is being actively promoted in other regions with suitable coal types (such as Datong, Shanxi). Medium, small, and even large square dry distillation furnaces with further increased production capacity have also been designed by the Fushun and Beijing design institutes under the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, and are available for selection in various regions.

    不用炼焦煤　要得冶金焦
    ——介绍几种简易的煤低温干馏炉
  　朱康福
    炼钢、炼铁都要求质量良好的焦炭。合于冶炼工业使用要求的焦炭，一般叫做冶金焦。冶金焦是用适于炼焦的煤在摄氏一千度左右的高温下炼成的，这种过程一般称为高温炼焦或煤的高温干馏。
    煤的种类很多，从炼焦的角度看，最合于炼作冶金焦的煤叫做“主焦煤”；可以适当掺入主焦煤一起炼焦的煤，叫做配焦煤。我国煤的资源很丰富，但主焦煤和配焦煤并不特别多，而且分布地区也不均匀。因此，设法利用其他煤种来炼冶金焦，有着重大意义。
    有些煤种例如山西大同的煤，本身质量很好，含硫、磷和灰分都少，但在高温炼焦的条件下，没有粘结能力，煤粒不能粘成强度够大的焦块，不能直接供给冶金工业应用。这样的煤，可以在较低的温度摄氏五百到六百度下进行干馏，把煤所含的挥发分干馏出来，得到所谓“半焦”。这种加工方法，叫做煤的低温干馏。
    无论高温炼焦或低温干馏，除得到焦或半焦外，都能从干馏气体中回收焦油和氨等。高温炼焦所得的高温焦油数量少，一般在大型洋炉生产中，高温焦油的收率不超过原料煤的4％—5％，土法生产中在目前还只能得到1％左右。而低温干馏所得的低温焦油数量多，就是简易土法生产，也常常可以达到原料煤含油量的70％—90％。如原料煤含油8％，每吨原料煤就可以收到五十六到七十二公斤，即占原料煤的5.6％—7.2％。低温焦油是人造石油的重要来源，还含有酚、吡啶等贵重化工原料。现在石油工业部所属单位和各地简易低温干馏工厂职工同志通过“低温干馏、高温处理”的方法，既能多得焦油，又能得到良好的焦炭，可以直接用来在二十八立方公尺的高炉中炼铁，干馏所余煤气还可以用来发电。这样，就使得低温干馏同时能够生产冶金焦、人造石油、化工原料和动力用燃料，成为综合利用煤炭的良好方法。
    现在介绍几种土法和简易的低温干馏炉：
        一、成堆干馏
    简单说来，就是把煤堆成长方形的堆。在煤堆顶上点火，利用堆底铺置的孔道抽风，这时因为上面燃烧的气体温度很高，就可把下面煤焦油蒸出，和瓦斯一道被抽，煤就成为半焦。干馏气体通过冷凝回收设备，收回焦油和氨，剩余煤气用作一般燃料或在煤气机内燃烧带动发电机发电。
    成堆干馏的主要设备只有抽气机一台，水泵一台。其余都用砖、土、缸瓦管、大缸和少量的水泥、木料制造，建造容易、操作简单，投资很少。每年生产低温焦油三百吨、焦炭约三千至四千吨的小型成堆干馏设备，只需四千元左右，适于人民公社举办。
    成堆干馏的缺点是间断生产，每次干馏都要先装堆，干馏完毕再来出焦。因此耗费劳动力较多。而且产生的煤气也不能连续供应。同时进入干馏堆的空气量不容易控制，难免烧去部分焦油和焦炭，使焦炭和焦油收率降低。
    但在成堆干馏时也完全可以结合低温干馏和高温炼焦的原理，不增加任何设备，就能有效地提高收率，特别是改进焦炭质量，使之符合高炉炼铁的要求。已经试用成功的有两种方法：
    1、瓦斯回堆（气燃式成堆干馏）
    把收油后剩余煤气的一部分送回干馏堆，使煤气在堆内燃烧，增加热量，提高温度。这样，堆内的煤先经过低温干馏的过程，回收多量的焦油，紧接着又在更高温度下除去挥发分使得焦炭改进了质量。一般瓦斯回堆可以使焦油产量提高10％，焦炭产量提高10％（都是对原来的产量来说），特别是焦炭中残留的挥发分大大降低，接近于一般土法炼焦所得的冶金焦。
    2、高温焖焦
    成堆干馏完毕以后，堆中的焦炭温度还很高，仍在摄氏五百度左右。而且堆内还留有一些煤，如果先不喷水熄焦，而把管道系统打开，使空气能够自由进入堆内，就可以引起较猛烈的燃烧，大大提高堆内温度（实际可以超过摄氏九百度以上）。这样高温焖焦十至十二小时以后，焦炭就能达到高炉炼铁的要求，真正达到“低温多出油，高温炼好焦”的目的。
    成堆干馏焖焦所得焦炭，先后在北京石景山钢铁厂二十立方公尺高炉和保定市第一机床厂二十八立方公尺高炉中炼铁成功，成绩十分良好，超过了使用土法炼得焦炭的指标。
    以上两种方法，可以同时采用，也可以只用一种，彼此并不矛盾。
    二、简易低温干馏炉——气燃式方型和圆型干馏炉
    采用瓦斯回堆、高温焖焦的成堆干馏，虽然较好地把低温干馏高温炼焦的原理结合起来，但基本生产设备——干馏堆还完全是土法的，仍然具有间断操作、多费劳动力等缺点。进一步贯彻土洋结合的方针，需要一种连续生产、产品均匀而设备、材料又易于取得的生产设备，这就是简易的气燃式小方炉和小圆炉。这两种简易干馏炉的生产原理、生产方法和其他生产设备都是一样的，只是炉形结构上有方、圆之别。
    这两种炉子的结构大意，可以从示意图中看出。煤连续地由炉顶加入，而焦炭由炉底扒出。回炉的煤气由炉底进入，助燃的空气由炉子中间偏下的地方进入，然后与干馏煤气一起由炉顶部分引出，通过回收系统，进入排送机，然后一部分煤气又回到炉内燃烧，剩余的煤气连续而均匀地作为一种副产品，用作燃料或发电的动力来源。一个每天处理十二吨煤的小方炉，可以均衡地发出一百二十瓩的电，除供给本身需要的动力以外，还可以供应其他用户一百瓩以上。
    这种简易气燃式炉的共同特点是：焦油收率很高，常在理论收油率的90％左右，焦炭、煤气质量均匀，炉内温度容易调节控制，而且可以达到摄氏一千一百度以上，以充分保证焦炭质量。热量的利用效率很高，生产连续，可以按建设条件利用半机械化操作，节省劳动力。而炉子本身，除掉使用很少一些钢铁和少数普通耐火砖及水泥外，其余仍旧是普通的砖、土、石灰、缸瓦管、大缸和木材，机械设备则比成堆干馏多用一台很小的鼓风机送入空气。
    现在中国科学院煤炭研究室设计的小方炉已在东北地区大量建造，在其他有合适煤种的地区（如山西大同等）也在积极推广。进一步加大生产能力的中、小型以至大型的方型干馏炉，也已由石油工业部所属抚顺和北京两个设计院进行定型设计，可供各地选用。（附图片）
