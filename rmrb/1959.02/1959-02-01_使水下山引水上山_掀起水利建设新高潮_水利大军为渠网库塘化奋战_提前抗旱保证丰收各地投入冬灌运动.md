Making Water Descend from the Mountains and Ascend to the Highlands, Setting Off a New Upsurge in Water Conservancy Construction
The Water Conservancy Army Fights for Canal Network Reservoir Systematization
Advance Drought Resistance to Ensure Good Harvests, Various Regions Invest in Winter Irrigation Movement

    (Our Dispatch) The water conservancy construction army in Gansu Province is braving the severe cold to fight for the systematization of water conservancy and the canal network reservoir construction throughout the province.

    More than 80% of Gansu's land is in the mountains. Overcoming drought is an extremely arduous task for the people of Gansu. After liberation, the Party and the government first conducted a large number of pilot projects in arid areas to change the drought and set an example, establishing the idea of ​​"man can conquer nature" among the people, laying the ideological foundation for large-scale water conservancy construction. Later, it mobilized the people of the province to build water conservancy in the plains, using river and canal water to increase water sources, making the plains water conservancy-oriented. In the winter of 1957 and 1958, the province launched a movement to divert water up the mountains. By the end of 1958, a total of 10,572 mountain canals had been built, irrigating 4.2 million mu of land. Together with the water conservancy projects built throughout the province since liberation, more than 26 million mu of land can be irrigated, which is 5.5 times the 4.71 million mu of water sources built in the thousands of years before liberation, initially changing the arid appearance of Gansu.

    At present, the province is fighting for the systematization of water conservancy and the construction of canal network reservoirs in the whole province in order to further eliminate the threat of drought. The main characteristics of this water conservancy movement are rapid progress and good quality. Currently, the irrigated area has been expanded by 950,000 mu.

    Also, since last winter, Gansu has had little rain and snow. According to the experience that drought may occur when rain and snow are scarce in previous years, the people of the province have started the drought resistance struggle ahead of schedule this year to prevent problems before they occur.

    Gansu plans to sow 50 million mu this year and requires 30 million mu for winter irrigation. Since last winter, the people of the province have been engaged in an intense winter irrigation movement. Various places are starting to harrow winter wheat fields and repair canals to prepare for the arrival of ice-melting water, and plans are being made to carry out ice collection and snow storage activities. It is required to ensure a good harvest of various crops such as grain, cotton and oil this year even in the most severe drought conditions. At present, the winter irrigation area in Zhangye and Dingxi prefectures alone exceeds 10 million mu. Huining County, the most arid county in Dingxi Prefecture, is using all available water day and night under the slogan of "irrigate one mu if possible", striving to complete all winter irrigation tasks before the Spring Festival.

    Gansu will use the above methods to prepare conditions for the upcoming spring sowing work this year, while eliminating second and third-class winter wheat fields, in order to make the first shot in this year's agricultural production.

    使水下山引水上山　掀起水利建设新高潮
    水利大军为渠网库塘化奋战
    提前抗旱保证丰收各地投入冬灌运动
    本报讯　甘肃省的兴修水利大军正冒着严寒为全省水利系统化和渠网库塘化而奋战。
    甘肃80％以上的土地都在高山上，战胜干旱，是甘肃人民一项异常艰苦的工作。解放后党和政府首先在干旱区大量试点，改变干旱，做出榜样，在人民中树立人定胜天思想，给大兴水利奠定了思想基础。以后，即动员全省人民在平川地区大兴水利，利用河、渠水增加水地，使平川地区水利化。1957年冬和1958年全省开展引水上山运动，到1958年底，共修上山渠道一万零五百七十二条，可灌溉土地四百二十万亩；加上解放后历年来全省兴修成的水利，可灌溉地二千六百多万亩，为解放前几千年兴修水地的四百七十一万亩的五点五倍，初步改变了甘肃的干旱面貌。
    目前，全省正在为全省水利系统化和渠网库塘化而奋战，以便进一步解除干旱的威胁。这次水利运动的主要特点是进展快，质量好，目前已扩大灌溉面积九十五万亩。
    又讯　甘肃自去冬以来雨雪稀少，按照往年雨雪稀少便有可能出现旱象的经验，今年全省人民提前开始抗旱斗争，以防患未然。
    甘肃今年计划播种面积五千万亩，要求冬灌三千万亩。自去冬以来，全省人民即投入了紧张的冬灌运动，各地正在纷纷开始耙耱冬小麦田地，修整渠道准备迎接消冰水，计划开展背冰积雪运动。要求在旱象最严重的情况下，保证今年粮棉油等各种农作物丰收。现在冬灌的面积仅张掖和定西两个专区即超过一千万亩。定西专区最干旱的会宁县，正在“能灌一亩是一亩”的口号下，利用一切可以利用的水，日夜不停地灌，争取春节前完成全部冬灌任务。
    甘肃将通过上述办法，为今年即将到来的春播工作准备条件，同时消灭冬小麦二、三类田，以打响今年农业生产上第一炮。

    甘肃永昌金川峡水库全部修成后，可蓄水一亿方，能灌溉四十万亩土地。这是正在施工中的水库工地一角。
