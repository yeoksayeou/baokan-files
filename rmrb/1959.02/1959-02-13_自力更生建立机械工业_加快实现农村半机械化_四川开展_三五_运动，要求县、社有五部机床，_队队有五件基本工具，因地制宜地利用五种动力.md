Self-Reliance in Establishing a Mechanical Industry
    Accelerating the Realization of Rural Semi-Mechanization
    Sichuan Launches the "Three-Five" Movement, Requiring Counties and Communes to Have Five Machine Tools, Teams to Have Five Basic Tools, and to Utilize Five Kinds of Power According to Local Conditions
    (Our dispatch) Chengdu - Sichuan Province is vigorously promoting the "Three-Five" movement in local mechanical industry, closely integrating it with tool reform, and is currently ushering in a new upsurge. This movement requires that by the end of this year, every county, district, and some people's commune farm tool factories throughout the province have five machine tools, every people's commune and some production teams have five basic tools such as thread rolling dies, bench vises, hacksaws, steel files, and drill presses, and that five kinds of power sources such as water, fire, livestock, wind, and gas (natural gas, biogas, etc.) are widely utilized. According to statistics from Wanxian, Fuling, Nanchong, Leshan, and other special districts, more than 400 farm tool factories have already achieved having five machine tools; more than 1,000 farm tool factories have five kinds of tools; and many factories have used hydropower and electricity as power for machine tools.
    The "Three-Five" movement was proposed by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China in September of last year. Based on the urgent demands of the broad masses of peasants for agricultural semi-mechanization since the Great Leap Forward, and summarizing the creations of the masses, the Provincial Committee believes that rapidly improving and changing the face of local mechanical industry and carrying out the "Three-Five" movement is the main measure for accelerating the realization of semi-mechanization in rural areas, and also a faster, better, and more economical way to achieve commune industrialization, agricultural mechanization, and electrification. This call was warmly supported by the local mechanical industry workers and peasant masses throughout the province, thus quickly setting off a mass upsurge of making machine tools, creating tools, installing hydropower stations, and using biogas.
    The situation in various places shows that the "Three-Five" movement has not only increased the productivity of farm tool factories by more than ten times compared to the past, but also produced a large number of efficient and qualified tools for making tools—lathes, planers, drilling machines, enabling the rapid construction of local mechanical industry networks in the vast rural areas. In places where the "Three-Five" movement has been initially realized, such as Lezhi and Fushun counties, it has become possible to manufacture and repair various tools in five areas: agricultural product processing, rural transportation, small-scale water conservancy, cultivation, and small-scale industry; in terms of farm tools, minor repairs can be done in the commune, and major repairs can be done in the factory. The 36 farm tool factories and more than 400 repair stations in Lezhi County, with an average of three machine tools per factory and five tools per station, have produced more than 520,000 pieces of sweet potato slicers, feed processors, various handcarts, water conservancy tools, and tractors in the past two months, and manufactured many kinds of industrial equipment such as blowers, water turbine shafts, and cement mills. As a result, the county can save 56 million labor days a year. Driven by the "Three-Five" movement, the construction of water conservancy and hydropower in the province has greatly accelerated, with the number of hydropower stations increasing from more than 1,400 to more than 2,800 in three months. In Yingshan County, 80% of the communes' hydropower stations were built during the movement.
    In the past, the equipment of machinery factories and farm tool factories in general areas of Sichuan Province was very poor, and some places had never even had lathes. Last year, the province decentralized a batch of old machine tools to some counties, but this did not solve the problem. Faced with this situation, the Party committees at all levels in Sichuan insisted on criticizing the idea of relying solely on the state and large-scale industrial support, relying on their own efforts, adopting indigenous methods, first indigenous then foreign, and making simple and indigenous machine tools on a large scale. The broad masses of people came up with thousands upon thousands of suggestions and creations. Some used existing broken machine tools to make new machine tools, and some simply used their hands and indigenous tools to make machine tools. Peng'an County had only two old machine tools and a hand drill in the first half of last year, but the workers used lathes for planing without planers, and steel files for milling without milling machines, and built more than 30 lathes and machines in two months. The Dongguan Farm Tool Factory in Nanchong County had nothing at all, and the workers relied on their hands, hammers, and steelmaking furnaces to build indigenous machine tools.
    During the movement, many problems such as equipment, raw materials, and technology were solved easily by relying on the masses. Some counties in Neijiang, Nanchong, and other regions found people with professional skills among the cadres through technical return, and discovered mechanics and tank soldiers from demobilized soldiers, plus training ironworkers, carpenters, pot menders, and plow casters among the masses, quickly building a mechanical army. In terms of manufacturing and installing equipment technology, various places adopted measures such as holding on-site meetings, running training classes, masters teaching apprentices, sending people out to learn, and inviting people in to teach, breaking the technical mystery that some people had, and learning quickly and well. In solving the steel problem, some counties cooperated with small-scale iron and steel enterprises, and some organized cooperation within the special district on a county basis, using indigenous iron and steel after completing state tasks to basically meet the needs. The masses of peasants also played a big role in contributing steel, iron, and materials. Various places also vigorously adopted substitutes, using wood and stone instead of steel to manufacture iron-wood structures and iron-concrete structures of machine tools. The iron-wood structure lathe manufactured by the Hongqi People's Commune Iron Factory in Nanchong County cost only one-seventh of the market price.
    This year, both industry and agriculture in rural Sichuan will have a greater leap forward than last year, and there is an urgent need to further promote various improved farm tools to improve efficiency and save labor. Under the guidance of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, all parts of the province have made the task of accelerating the realization of the "Three-Five" movement an important action to welcome spring plowing and to prepare better conditions for running industries in the people's communes.

    自力更生建立机械工业
    加快实现农村半机械化
    四川开展“三五”运动，要求县、社有五部机床， 队队有五件基本工具，因地制宜地利用五种动力
    本报讯　四川省紧密结合工具改革大力开展的地方机械工业的“三五”运动，目前正在掀起一个新的高潮。这个运动要求今年年内做到全省每个县、区和部分人民公社农具厂都有五部机床，每个人民公社和部分生产队有套丝板、老虎钳、钢锯、钢锉、台钻等五大基本工具，并广泛利用水、火、畜、风、气（天然气、沼气等）等五种动力。到最近为止，据万县、涪陵、南充、乐山等部分专区统计，各地已实现有五部机床的农具厂就已有四百多个；有五种工具的农具厂一千多个；许多工厂都使用了水力、电力做为机床动力。
    “三五”运动是中共四川省委在去年9月提出的。省委根据大跃进以来农村广大群众对农业半机械化的迫切要求，总结了群众的创造，认为迅速提高和改变地方机械工业的面貌，开展“三五”运动，是当前农村加速实现半机械化的主要措施，也是实现公社工业化、农业机械化、电气化的一条多快好省的道路。这个号召得到全省地方机械工业职工和农民群众的热烈拥护，从而迅速掀起了一个群众性制机床、造工具、安装水电站、使用沼气的热潮。
    各地情况表明，“三五”运动不仅使农具厂的生产力比过去提高十几倍，而且造出了大量效率高、质量合用的制造工具的工具——车床、刨床、钻床，使广大农村迅速建成地方机械工业网。在初步实现“三五”运动的地方，如乐至、富顺等县，已经能够制造、修理农产品加工、农村运输、小型水利、耕作和小型工业等五方面的各种工具；在农具方面，也做到了小修不出社，大修不出厂。乐至县的三十六个农具厂和四百多个修配站平均每个厂有三部机床，每个站有五件工具，两个多月来就生产了红苕切片、饲料加工、各种手推车、水利工具以及牵引机等五十二万多部，制造了鼓风机、水轮机轴、水泥磨等工业设备许多种。全县因此一年可节省劳动日五千六百多万个。在“三五”运动推动下，全省水利、水电建设大大加快，三个月中水力、水电站从一千四百多个增加到二千八百多个。营山县80％的公社的水电站都是在运动中建成的。
  过去，四川省一般地区机械厂、农具厂的设备都很差，有些地方甚至车床都从未有过。去年，全省下放了一批老旧机床给部分县，但也并未解决问题。面对这一情况，四川各级党委坚持批判了部分人单纯依靠国家、依靠大工业支援的想法，自力更生，采用土办法，先土后洋，大造简易机床和土机床。广大群众千方百计，提出成千上万的建议和创造，有的用原有的破旧机床造出了新机床，有的根本就用双手和土工具造出了机床。蓬安县去年上半年还只有两台旧机床和一台手摇钻，但职工们没有刨床就用车床平面构着刨，没有铣床铣就用钢锉锉，两个月中就造出了三十多台车床和机器。南充县东观农具厂更是什么都没有，职工们凭着双手和铁锤以及炼钢红炉就造出了土机床。
    在运动中由于依靠群众，设备、原材料、技术等许多问题也迎刃而解。内江、南充等地区一些县通过技术归队，从干部中把学过专业技术的人找出来，从复员军人中发掘机械兵、坦克兵，加上训练群众中的铁工、木工、补锅匠、铸铧匠，迅速地建成了一支机械大军。在制造、安装设备技术上，各地采取开现场会、办训练班、师傅带徒弟、派人出去学、请人进来教，打破了有的人存在的技术神秘观点，学得又快又好。在解决钢材问题上，有的县和小型钢铁企业配合协作，有的以县为单位组织专区内的协作，利用完成国家任务后的土铁土钢基本上满足了需要。农民群众献钢、献铁、献料也起了很大作用。各地还大力采用代用品，以木、石代钢铁，制造铁木结构、铁和水泥结构的机床。南充县红旗人民公社铁工厂制造的铁木结构车床，成本只有市价的七分之一。
    今年，四川农村工农业都要有一个比去年更大的跃进，急需进一步推广各种改良农具以提高工效，节约劳力。在中共四川省委指示下，全省各地把加快实现“三五”运动的任务列为迎接春耕和为人民公社办工业准备更好条件的重要行动。
