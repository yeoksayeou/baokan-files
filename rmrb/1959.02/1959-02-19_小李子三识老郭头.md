Technician Little Li had just arrived at the factory and heard that furnace worker Old Guo's Head had been smelting steel for over thirty years. Many of his apprentices had become foremen and furnace chiefs, and even the factory director would consult with him when making decisions. He really wanted to learn from this capable veteran worker. After Little Li was assigned to the steelmaking workshop, he saw that Old Guo's Head was a short, bald man who always had a dry tobacco pipe in his mouth and didn't look like a steelworker at all! During meetings, he always lowered his head and puffed on his dry tobacco pipe, making everyone impatient, and he wouldn't say a word for a long time. Sometimes, he would suddenly say "No" and stubbornly stick to "No," no matter how others explained it. Where was the "No"? He couldn't explain it clearly, so everyone said, "The old man is really stubborn!"

	The First Recognition

If his stubbornness was because he couldn't explain the reason clearly, that would be better; but sometimes he didn't even have a reason. Not long ago, the No. 2 electric furnace had just been built, and everyone was looking forward to putting it into production immediately to fight for doubling steel production. Who knew that Old Guo's Head would raise concerns about the quality of the cooling water pipes, insisting that they weren't ready and couldn't be put into production immediately! When asked how many more days it would take, he puffed on his pipe and slowly said, "According to the old rules, it would take seven days. Now that we're in the Great Leap Forward, everyone should work hard and try to finish it in one day..." Little Li was annoyed when he heard this: "Now everyone is racing against time, but he's still calculating in days! No wonder some people say that although old workers have skills, their thinking is conservative." Therefore, when the workshop decided that Old Guo's Head should accelerate the equipment repair on one hand, and Little Li should prepare for production on the other hand, Little Li didn't wait for Old Guo's Head to finish his work and started charging the furnace with the workers to smelt steel.

The new furnace's production was indeed smooth. When the current and voltage were increased, the furnace "roared" and shot flames in all directions, quickly melting the pig iron and scrap steel. Then everyone added lime and ore into the furnace with shovels. It looked like steel could be produced in just over four hours! Who knew that the second assistant would pull him aside: "Technician, look, what's going on?" He raised his red and blue framed glasses and looked inside the furnace through the furnace door. Alas, the furnace was leaking water! Water can't come into contact with molten steel! He immediately asked everyone to check where the water was leaking and to plug it quickly. But they couldn't find it. At this moment, someone shouted, "The furnace is going to explode!" Everyone dropped their shovels and ran in all directions in panic. Little Li also rushed to the door in a panic, but he caught a glimpse of a short figure rushing past him and straight towards the furnace that was about to explode. He was stunned: It was Old Guo's Head! He quickly shouted, "Get out of the way, the furnace is going to explode!" But Old Guo's Head didn't seem to hear him. He disappeared behind the furnace for a moment, then turned around and opened the furnace door to take a look, and shouted to everyone, "What are you running for! Hurry back!" Old Guo's Head rushed forward in the emergency and closed the water valve, and there was no more water in the furnace. Little Li lowered his head in shame and came over, wondering how Old Guo's Head would scold him! Unexpectedly, Old Guo's Head only said softly:

"Hurry up and produce steel! Be calmer in the future." But he saw Old Guo's Head pull the first steelmaking worker aside, raise his eyebrows, and pout his beard, and sternly reprimanded him: "Technician Little Li is young and inexperienced, but you've been working for seven or eight years, don't you have any experience? Running away from the furnace like that will cause it to explode even if it wasn't going to!"

	The Second Recognition

The workshop decided that Old Guo's Head would explain safety production knowledge to everyone. Many new workers asked him why water would explode when it encountered molten iron or molten steel. Old Guo's Head talked for a long time and only said one sentence: "Water and fire are incompatible!" Everyone was very dissatisfied. At this time, Little Li took the initiative to look through books and explained for him: Steel needs to be heated to 1300-1400 degrees Celsius to melt. When water encounters such high temperatures, it will decompose into hydrogen and oxygen and generate more than a thousand atmospheres of pressure. One atmosphere of pressure will cause one kilogram of pressure on one square centimeter of area (the size of a fingernail). Thousands of atmospheres of pressure will cause gas with thousands of kilograms of pressure to expand in all directions, forming a huge explosion. Old Guo's Head, puffing on his dry tobacco pipe, nodded in agreement: "That's the principle. Water and fire are incompatible!"

It just so happened that two days later, the adjacent iron smelting furnace burned through the furnace wall. Everyone immediately braved the flames to block the hole, but several hundred kilograms of molten iron had already leaked out. The molten iron flowed along the iron tapping platform towards the ground, and it was about to flow onto the newly mixed wet refractory mud in front, which would cause an explosion. Little Li was so anxious that his heart was racing, but he didn't know how to deal with the emergency. Who knew that Old Guo's Head would pick up the rubber water pipe next to him and spray water on the dazzling molten iron. Wasn't this courting death? A burst of steamy white mist suddenly rushed up from the ground, blinding everyone, but when the mist cleared, it was strange, the molten iron was lying obediently on the watery ground, turning into increasingly dark, dark red iron blocks. What was the principle behind this? Old Guo's Head struggled for a long time and only managed to utter one sentence: "Water can overcome fire!" Little Li went to consult with the old engineer. The old engineer said: "Gases with thousands of atmospheres of pressure will explode if there is nowhere to release them. When you spray water from the outside, the gases are released into the space, so it naturally won't explode." The old engineer also said: "The principle is very simple, but to remain calm on the spot, quickly judge the situation, and come up with a solution requires courage, resourcefulness, a high sense of responsibility, and rich experience."

	The Third Recognition

After these two rescue operations, Little Li was truly convinced from the bottom of his heart and decided to seriously learn from Old Guo's Head.

However, Old Guo's Head was really hard to learn from. After the rolling mill workshop came up with ideas to increase production, they posted a big-character poster for them, which read: "Rolling mill, starving belly, only because steel ingot production is low. Calling out to steelmaking elder brothers: Liberate your minds and work hard, increase production and strive for first place!"

Little Li immediately proposed a method of charging more molten iron into the converter to produce more steel, but Old Guo's Head was the one who opposed it again. He also said: "If you charge more molten iron into the furnace without improving the furnace lining and tuyeres, the molten iron will be blown away, the blowing time will also be prolonged, and you won't produce much more steel." If you don't agree, come up with another method! He puffed on his dry tobacco pipe for a long time before slowly saying a weak sentence: "It would be good if the blowing process could be faster." Little Li was anxious, so he immediately asked the workshop for approval to carry out the experiment of charging more iron.

It was a strange thing. They charged 200 kilograms more molten iron, but only produced a dozen kilograms more steel ingots, and the blowing time for each furnace was extended by 34 minutes, just like Old Guo's Head predicted. At this time, a lot of iron was blown into iron oxide scale (slag) and blown into the flue. If they went up to knock it down, it would delay production time. If they didn't knock it down, they were afraid that it would fall down and damage the furnace.

The rolling mill was not getting enough, and the factory called them every day to urge them. At this time, Little Li went to study with the workers, but the workers couldn't come up with another method for a while. They only said that Old Guo's Head had been thinking about it for days and nights and had probably come up with a good method. He patiently went to Old Guo's Head again, but Old Guo's Head was still so slow. He puffed on his dry tobacco pipe for a long time before saying: "See if we can add some flue dust to the furnace to smelt and shorten the blowing time?" Slag can smelt steel? If it could really be done this way, then why bother blowing the slag out of the furnace? People were anxious and going around in circles, but he was just making fun of people!

The next day, Little Li was sitting in the office with a gloomy face, but he saw Old Guo's Head pushing the door in with a smile, holding a large red piece of paper in his hand. He put the red paper on the table, squinted his eyes, and warmly called out: "Little Li, let's write a big-character poster together. I'll say it, and you write it." Little Li picked up the pen lazily, but he heard Old Guo's Head say: "Rolling brothers, don't worry, steel ingots are guaranteed for you to eat. If you don't believe it, let's compare and see who increases production the most!"

"You've come up with a good method?" Little Li raised his head in surprise. Old Guo's Head told him with a smile: Director Yang convened a meeting of veteran workers yesterday, and I brought up the idea of adding flue dust. Director Yang studied it with the engineers overnight and believed that flue dust is iron oxide, which can help oxidize the molten iron, remove impurities such as silicon, manganese, and carbon, speed up the blowing process, and shorten the blowing time. At the same time, it can also reduce the iron contained in the slag to the steel water, increasing the weight of the steel. Director Yang has already gone to the workshop to experiment. Little Li said "Ha!" and pulled Old Guo's Head straight to the workshop…

At this time, the first furnace of steel had just been tapped, and the second furnace of molten iron was immediately poured in. The converter, which had added a portion of flue dust, had just turned around when a gust of wind sounded, blowing out ten thousand golden sparks, and then blowing out a burst of flames. The furnace blew louder and louder, the flames blew higher and higher, and it immediately became a straight beam of golden light several feet high. Old Guo's Head saw the color of the fire change through his framed glasses and immediately gave a gesture: Stop the wind and tap the steel! Little Li looked at his watch: only fifteen minutes per furnace! Director Yang calculated: In the past, it took eighteen minutes to blow one furnace. Adding the auxiliary work time, a pair of furnaces could blow one hundred furnaces a day. Now, by shortening three minutes per furnace, they can produce fifteen more furnaces of steel a day. He immediately announced:

"Carry forward the spirit of hard work and research of Teacher Guo, and march towards producing 150 furnaces a day!"

At this time, Little Li looked at Director Yang, then looked at Old Guo's Head, and tears welled up in his eyes…

    小李子三识老郭头
    曹葆铭
    技术员小李子初到工厂，就听说护炉工老郭头炼过三十多年钢，他的许多徒弟也当上了工长、炉长，厂长决定问题有时也要找他商量。他真想跟这个有本事的老把式美美地学习一番。小李子被分配到炼钢车间以后，却见老郭头竟是矮小个儿的光秃头，还成天衔根旱烟袋，压根儿不像个炼钢工！开会时，见他总是低着头“吧——?，吧——?”抽他的旱烟，抽的旁人心都烦了，他还半天不说话。有时，他突然说上一句“不行”就硬“不行”，随便别人怎样解释也“不行”。“不行”在哪里？他又说不清楚，因此大家都说：“老头儿的脾气真倔！”
      第　一　识
    倔脾气，如果是有道理没说清，那还好些；他有时就连个道理也没有。不久前，二号电炉刚建成，大家都盼望它马上投入生产，为钢产量翻番而战斗。谁知老郭头却提出什么冷却水管的质量不合格啦，硬说没准备好，不能马上投入生产！问他还得多少天？他“吧?”着烟袋，慢腾腾地说：“按老规矩得七天，现在大跃进，大家抓紧些，争取一天搞成，……”小李子一听就烦了：“现在大家都是分秒必争，他却还在按天算时间！怪不得有人讲老工人虽然有技术，可就是思想保守。”因此，当车间决定一边由老郭头加速检修设备，一边由小李子准备生产的时候，小李子不等老郭头把活儿干完，就同工人们一起加料炼钢了。
    新炉子的生产也真顺利。电流电压一加大，炉里就“烘烘烘”地向四外射出烈火，很快将生铁、废钢熔开。大家接着又一锹一铲地往炉里加石灰，加矿石。眼看四个多钟头就能出钢！谁知第二助手拉了他一把：“技术员，你看，这是咋搞的？”他举起红蓝色的方框眼镜，从炉门往里一瞧，哎呀，炉里竟漏水了！水不能同钢水接触啊！他马上要大家检查哪里漏水，赶快堵上。可就是查不出来。这时，不知是谁喊了一声：“炉子要炸了！”大家慌忙丢下锹铲，就往四面乱跑。小李子这时也跟着急窜到大门边上，却瞥见一个矮小的身影从他身边闯过，直朝就要爆炸的炉子冲去。他一怔：是老郭头！他赶紧喊道：“快躲开，炉子要炸了！”但老郭头却像没听见似的，隐没到炉子后面去了一下，马上又转来打开炉门看了看，向大家喊道：“跑什么！还不赶快回来！”老郭头竟在紧急中冲上前去关死了水门，炉里已没水了。小李子惶愧地低着头挨了过来，想着老郭头不知会怎么训斥他呢！不料老郭头只轻轻说了一句：
  “快出钢吧！以后做事镇静些。”但他却瞅见老郭头把第一炼钢工拉到旁边去，竖着眉毛，噘着胡子，狠狠地训了一通：“小李子技术员年轻没经验，你干了七八年，也没经验？这样丢下炉子就跑，不炸的也会炸了！”
      第　二　识
    车间决定由老郭头向大家讲解安全生产知识。许多新工人问他为啥水遇到了铁水、钢水会爆炸，老郭头讲了半天就只这么一句：“水火不相容嘛！”大家很不满足。小李子这时就自动去翻书本，替他解释：钢铁要一千三、四百度才能熔化，水遇到这样的高温，便会分解成氢气和氧气，并产生一千多个大气压。一个大气压会使一平方公分的面积（指甲那么大）受一公斤压力，上千个大气压就有上千公斤压力的气体向四面扩张，形成巨大的爆炸。“吧?”着旱烟袋的老郭头，这时也在旁直点头：“就是这个道理。水火不相容嘛！”
    事也凑巧，刚过两天，邻近的化铁炉烧穿炉壁了。大家马上冒着烈火将漏洞堵上，但已漏出几百公斤铁水。铁水就沿着出铁平台往地上淌，眼看就会淌到前面新拌的湿耐火泥上，引起爆炸。这时急的小李子心直跳，可就不知怎么才能急救。谁知老郭头拿起旁边的橡皮水管，就往刺眼的铁水上喷水。这不是自找死吗？只见地上猛冲起一阵蒸人的白雾，迷的人啥也看不见，但当迷雾散去后，咳，真怪，铁水却乖乖儿地躺在水地上，成了越来越暗的殷红铁块。这又是啥道理呢？老郭头憋了半天也只憋出一句话：“水能克火嘛！”小李子去请教老工程师，老工程师说：“上千个大气压的气体没地方放散，才会爆炸。从外面喷水，气体都散到空间了，自然不会炸。”老工程师还说：“道理说穿了很简单，但要临场不乱，马上判清情况，拿出办法来，可就得凭勇敢、机智，凭高度的责任心和丰富的经验了。”
      第　三　识
    经过这两次抢险，小李子真是从心底里折服了，决心要认真向老郭头学习。
    但是，老郭头也真叫人很难向他学习。轧钢车间想法提高生产后，给他们贴了张大字报，写的是：“轧钢机，饿肚皮，只因钢锭产量低。叫声炼钢老大哥：解放思想快努力，提高产量争第一！”
    小李子马上提出转炉多装铁水多出钢的办法，可是偏偏又是老郭头反对。他还说什么：“炉子多装铁水，要不连炉膛和风眼一起改进，那铁水会吹跑了，吹炼时间也会延长，多出不了钢。”你不同意就拿出别的办法来呀！他又“啪?”了半天旱烟袋，才慢腾腾地说出一句不吃劲的话来：“要能吹炼的快些就好了。”小李子急了，便马上请示车间批准，进行多装的试验。
    事情也真怪，他们多装了两百公斤铁水，结果只多出了十多公斤钢锭，而每炉吹炼时间还延长了三十四分钟，跟老郭头预言的情况一个样。这时，许多铁都吹成了氧化铁皮（渣子），吹到烟道上面去了。上去打掉吧，耽误生产时间，不打掉吧，又怕掉下来砸坏炉子。
    轧钢机吃不饱，厂里成天打电话催他们。小李子这时去找工人们研究，工人们也一时拿不出别的办法来，只说老郭头已经思谋了几天几夜，大概想出了好办法。他又耐着性子去找老郭头，老郭头还是那么慢腾腾的，“吧?”了半天旱烟袋，才说：“看能不能加点烟道渣到炉里去炼，把吹炼时间缩短些？”渣子能炼钢？要真能这样，那又何必把渣子从炉里吹出来呢？人家急的团团转，他还寻人开心！
    第二天，小李子愁眉苦脸地坐在办公室里，却见老郭头笑盈盈地推门进来，手里还拿了张大红纸。他把红纸往桌上一放，眯着眼睛，亲热地叫道：“小李子，咱俩来写张大字报。俺说你写。” 小李子懒洋洋地提起笔来，却听老郭头说的是：“轧钢兄弟莫着急，钢锭保你有吃的。不信咱们比一比，看谁增产数第一？”
    “你想出好办法来了？”小李子惊异地抬起头来。老郭头笑嘻嘻地告诉他：杨厂长昨天召集老工人开会，我就把加烟道渣的想法提了出来。杨厂长连夜跟工程师们研究，认为烟道渣是氧化铁，可以帮助铁水氧化，去掉矽、锰、炭等杂物，加快吹炼速度，缩短吹炼时间。同时，还能把渣子里含的铁还原到钢水中，增加钢的重量。杨厂长已经到车间试验去了。小李子“嗐”了一声，拉着老郭头就朝车间直跑……
    这时，头炉钢刚出炉，马上就倾入第二炉铁水。加了一部分烟道渣的转炉，刚转过身来，就响起一阵风声，吹出万朵金星火花，然后又吹出一股烈火。炉子越吹越响，烈火越吹越高，顿时便成了一道几尺高的笔直的金光。老郭头从方框眼镜中看见火光变色了，马上打一个手势：停风出钢！小李子一看表：只十五分钟一炉！杨厂长计算了一下：过去十八分钟吹炼一炉，加上辅助工作时间，一对炉子每天能吹炼一百炉；现在每炉缩短三分钟，一天便能多出十五炉钢。他马上宣布：
    “发扬郭老师傅刻苦钻研的精神，向日炼一百五十炉进军！”
    小李子这时望望杨厂长，又看看老郭头，不知怎么眼里竟冒出泪来了……
