    What Happened at the Train Station
    The following moving incident occurred at the train station.
    One morning, tickets for a train from Zhenjiang to Shanghai were sold out, and passengers were entering the station. At this moment, a comrade in work clothes hurried to the ticket window.
    "Hey! Comrade, are there any tickets left for this train?"
    "Sorry, the tickets are sold out."
    "What should I do? I must take this train! Otherwise, it will be too late…." The passenger looked around anxiously.
    "Do you have something very important?" the ticket seller asked with concern.
    "Yes, the blast furnace in our factory needs to be ignited, and we are short of a blower. The leadership wants me to go to Shanghai to get it back as soon as possible. The sooner I get the blower, the sooner we can produce iron."
    "Wait here and see if any passengers return their tickets," the ticket seller said, having no better solution.
      "Comrade, I have a ticket here. You can take it." A demobilized soldier in military uniform said, taking a train ticket from his wallet.
    Just as the passenger buying the blower was about to ask the name of the comrade in military uniform, the train whistle suddenly blew shrilly, and the train to Shanghai entered the station. The comrade in military uniform urged him to get on the train quickly. As the passengers entered the station, they couldn't help but turn back and look at the comrade in military uniform with respect. Zhenjiang City, Xue Qishou

    火车站上发生的事情
    车站上发生了这样一件令人感动的事情。
    一天上午，由镇江去上海的一次列车票已经卖完了，旅客们纷纷进了站。这时，一位身着工作服的同志急忙跑到售票窗口。
    “喂！同志，请问这趟车还有车票吗？”
    “对不起，车票已卖完了。”
    “这怎么办呢？我一定要乘这趟车去啊！不然就来不及了……。”这位旅客焦急地四面看看。
    “你有很要紧的事吗？”售票员关心地问。
    “有，我们工厂里的高炉要生火，就缺少鼓风机，领导上要我赶紧到上海领回来。早一些拿到鼓风机，就能早一些出铁。”
    “你先在这里等等，看有没有旅客退票。”售票的同志也没更好的办法。
      “同志，我这儿有一张票，你拿去吧。”一位身穿军衣的复员军人同志，说着就从皮夹里拿出一张火车票。
    买鼓风机的旅客正想知道这位穿军衣的同志叫什么名字，突然，火车汽笛尖锐地叫了一声，到上海去的列车进站了。穿军衣的同志催促他快点上车。旅客们进了车站，都不由得回过头来，用崇敬的眼光望着这位穿军衣的同志。　镇江市　薛启寿
