    Rapidly Increase Production of More Acids and Alkalis
    By a Commentator of this Newspaper
    China’s acid and alkali industry saw significant growth in 1958. Compared to 1957, soda ash production increased by 29%, caustic soda by 31%, and sulfuric acid by 19%. However, with the Great Leap Forward in all sectors of the national economy, the current demand for acids and alkalis, especially soda ash, caustic soda, and sulfuric acid, is extremely high in industrial and agricultural production and people's lives. Looking at the whole year, although the production and demand of acids and alkalis can be basically balanced with effective measures and strenuous efforts, there is still a certain gap between production and demand in the first half of the year, especially at present. Therefore, measures must be taken quickly to actively increase the production of acids and alkalis. China is very rich in natural resources for acids and alkalis, such as salt and pyrite, and has also initially established an acid and alkali industrial base since liberation. As long as we seize the following measures, the production of acids and alkalis can be greatly increased to gradually meet the needs of all parties.
    First, it is necessary to give full play to the production capacity of existing factories. It is entirely possible to increase output by 20%, 40%, or even double it without increasing or slightly increasing equipment through mass movements centered on technological revolution. At present, the production potential of old factories is still considerable. Rapid production increases can be achieved by fully mobilizing the masses to carry out technological revolution and strengthening production maintenance and repair work. The Dalian Chemical Plant plans to increase its soda ash output from 1,200 tons per day to 2,000 tons per day before May 1st through technological revolution, which is proof of this. Although the equipment and other conditions of other old factories are different, if each old factory can conscientiously mobilize the masses to carry out technological revolution, then the output of acids and alkalis will definitely increase rapidly.
    Second, concentrating the necessary forces to tackle the finishing work of many newly built acid and alkali factories in various provinces and cities is also an important way to rapidly increase the production of acids and alkalis. These factories only lack a small amount of equipment and materials. As long as the relevant departments provide support and supervision, most of them can be put into production by the end of the first quarter or the beginning of the second quarter. According to estimates from the recent acid and alkali professional conference held in Beijing, if these factories can be put into production on schedule or ahead of schedule, this year will increase the production of more than 100,000 tons of sulfuric acid and tens of thousands of tons of caustic soda.
    The third measure is to speed up the construction and increase new factories. In the past, the increase in the production of acids and alkalis mainly relied on the expansion of several old factories in Northeast and North China, and the number of new factories did not increase much. Acids and alkalis are widely used, inconvenient to transport, and the raw materials are available everywhere. Therefore, it is necessary to actively increase new factories and gradually achieve a rational distribution, so as to lay the foundation for further leaps forward. From now on, we should concentrate our efforts on the construction of acid and alkali factories in Zigong, Zhanjiang, Xin Hailian, Kaifeng, Quzhou, and Xi'an, and strive to establish them in half a year or a little longer.
    The fourth measure is for user departments to run their own acid and alkali industries or carry out recycling work. Metallurgical, light industry, petroleum and other departments need a lot of acids and alkalis. Self-production by user departments can not only save transportation and ensure production, but also comprehensively utilize the by-products or waste gas of these departments. For example, a large amount of tail gas from non-ferrous metal smelting can be used to make sulfuric acid, and the paper industry can recycle 50% of the caustic soda used. User departments running their own acid and alkali industries can save a lot of transportation equipment and packaging materials, and can also simplify the process and reduce costs. For example, if the paper industry produces its own caustic soda, it may be possible to directly use chlorine gas to bleach pulp (i.e. chlorinated pulp), avoiding many process steps of making bleaching powder from chlorine gas.
    The fifth measure is to actively develop natural resources. The natural alkali reserves in Inner Mongolia and other places are abundant, and some contain up to 50% sodium carbonate, which is a very valuable resource for the motherland. As long as we seize the organization of excavation and transportation, hundreds of thousands of tons of natural alkali can be produced in the first and second quarters, which will greatly help to quickly solve the shortage of soda ash. Pyrite is the raw material for sulfuric acid (and can produce iron as a by-product). In the past, we only relied on the raw materials from several large mines such as Tongguanshan, Yingde, and Xiangshan. In the future, we should also pay attention to the development of new mines.
    At present, the main difficulty generally felt in the construction of the acid and alkali industry is the shortage of equipment and materials, which is the key to solving the problem of insufficient acid and alkali supply. Therefore, in addition to striving for self-reliance and striving for external assistance, all localities should vigorously study, experiment, and promote the use of non-metallic equipment. Non-metallic materials (including ceramics, glass, cement, rock, bamboo, wood, plastics, rubber, etc.) have better acid and alkali resistance and abundant resources. All localities have the tradition and habit of manufacturing and using them. Therefore, the range that can be used in the acid and alkali industry (especially small and medium-sized factories) is quite wide. This is a new and important technical measure. On the one hand, we must oppose conservative thinking and be bold in creation. On the other hand, we must adopt a scientific attitude and promote it after necessary research and experiments.
    It is difficult, but also possible, to solve the problem of insufficient supply of acids and alkalis. As long as we put politics in command, rely on the leadership of the Party committees of various provinces and cities, and resolutely follow the mass line, the further leap forward of the acid and alkali industry can be fully realized.

    迅速增产更多的酸碱
    本报评论员
    我国酸碱工业在1958年有了很大的增长。1958年与1957年相比，纯碱增长了29％，烧碱增长了31％，硫酸增长了19％。但是随着国民经济各部门的大跃进，目前，工农业生产和人民生活对酸碱特别是对纯碱、烧碱和硫酸的需要量十分巨大。从今年全年来看，虽然只要采取有效措施和经过紧张的努力，酸碱的生产和需要之间可以基本上达到平衡，但是在上半年，特别是在目前，生产和需要之间还有一定距离。因此必须迅速采取措施，积极增产酸碱。我国酸碱的自然资源食盐和硫铁矿十分丰富，解放以后也初步建立了酸碱工业基础，只要抓紧以下几个措施，酸碱就能大量增产，逐步满足各方面的需要。
    首先，必须充分发挥老厂的生产能力，通过以技术革命为中心的群众运动，在不增或少增设备的情况下，把产量提高20％、40％以至一倍，是完全可能做得到的。目前，老厂的生产潜力还不小，只要充分发动群众开展技术革命，加强生产维护检修工作，就可以迅速增产。大连化工厂计划在“五一”前通过技术革命把纯碱产量从日产一千二百吨提高到日产二千吨就是证明。尽管其他老厂的设备等条件各有所不同，但是如果各个老厂都能认真发动群众大搞技术革命，那么，酸碱的产量肯定会迅速地提高。
    其次，集中必要力量突击各省市许多新建酸碱工厂的扫尾工程，也是迅速增产酸碱的重要办法。这些工厂只缺少少量的设备和材料，只要有关部门加以支援和督促，大部分都可以在一季末或二季初投入生产。据最近在北京召开的酸碱专业会议估计，这些工厂如果能按期或提前投入生产，今年将增产十余万吨硫酸，数万吨烧碱。
    第三个措施是加快建设速度，增加新的工厂。过去酸碱的增产主要是依靠东北和华北几个老厂扩建，新工厂增加不多。酸碱用途广，不便运输，原料又各处都有，因此还必须积极地增加新的工厂，逐步做到合理分布，为进一步跃进打下基础。从现在起，应该集中力量突击建设自贡、湛江、新海连、开封、衢州、西安等酸碱工厂，力争用半年或稍多一点的时间建立起来。
    第四个措施是使用部门自己来办酸碱工业或进行回收工作。冶金、轻工、石油等部门都需要很多酸碱，使用部门自己生产，不但可以节省运输、保证生产，而且还可以综合利用这些部门的副产品或废气，例如有色金属冶炼的大量尾气可以做硫酸，造纸工业可以回收所用烧碱的50％等。使用部门自己办酸碱工业，可以省去很多运输设备和包装材料，还可以简化工艺，降低成本。例如造纸工业自产烧碱，就有可能直接用氯气漂白纸浆（即氯化纸浆），避免将氯气制成漂粉的许多工艺过程。
    第五个措施是积极开发天然资源。内蒙古等地的天然碱储量丰富，含炭酸钠有的可达50％，是祖国一项极宝贵的资源。只要抓紧组织开挖和运输，在一二季度内就可以生产天然碱几十万吨，对迅速解决纯碱不足作用很大。硫铁矿是硫酸的原料（可以副产生铁），过去只依靠铜官山、英德、向山等几个大矿的原料，今后也应注意开发新的矿山。
    目前，在建设酸碱工业中普遍感到的主要困难是设备材料不足，这是解决酸碱供应不足问题的关键。因此各地除必须努力自力更生和力争外援外，还应大力研究、试验和推广使用非金属设备。非金属材料（包括陶瓷、玻璃、水泥、岩石、竹木、塑料、橡胶等）耐酸碱性能较好，资源丰富，各地又都有制造使用的传统和习惯，因此在酸碱工业上（特别是中小型工厂）可能使用的范围是相当广的。这是一项新的重要的技术措施，一方面要反对保守思想，大胆创造，一方面又要以科学态度通过必要的研究试验再予推广。
    解决酸碱供应不足的问题是有困难的，但也是有办法的。只要政治挂帅，依靠各省市党委的领导，坚决走群众路线，酸碱工业的进一步跃进是完全可能实现的。
