It is most appropriate to call the Qaidam Basin the "Treasure Bowl" of the motherland. Although only a portion of this area, roughly the size of Great Britain, has been surveyed, its rich treasures have already been revealed. In recent years, tens of thousands of outstanding sons and daughters from all over the country, with the support of the people of the whole country, have been exploring and developing the basin simultaneously. The Treasure Bowl has begun to blossom with construction and is offering its treasures for the socialist construction of the motherland.

			  Cold Lake – Oil Lake
    The northern part of the Qaidam is traversed by the Tanggula Mountains, which are covered with snow all year round. At the foot of the mountains lies a Gobi desert area of ​​several hundred square kilometers. Derricks stand tall, and vehicles travel back and forth. This is the famous Lenghu exploration area. "Cold Lake" is the name given by the geological personnel because they found a small lake here, and the climate was cold, so they called this area "Cold Lake". Now, the people here proudly say: Cold Lake has become an Oil Lake.

    Going south from the Cold Lake base for twenty kilometers, there is an undulating mountain range. This is the Lenghu No. 5 structure. On the hillside, artificial dikes have been built to form a series of oil lakes. Since the No. 4 well gushed oil in September last year, six exploration wells have continuously gushed a large amount of crude oil, with daily output of more than 200 tons, and the most was 800 tons. There was so much crude oil that there was nowhere to store it, so it gathered in the depressions to form lakes. Even ducks flew into the "lake" to look for food! Now, the No. 5 structure area has become a new city with 3,000 residents. It concentrates more than a dozen of the best drilling teams, launching the Cold Lake "Great Battle", to find out the area and reserves of this large oil field in the shortest possible time. The oil-producing exploration wells have become production wells. Oil tankers fully loaded with crude oil are constantly driving out of here. A refinery in this exploration area refines crude oil from the No. 5 structure. In addition to guaranteeing the self-sufficiency of kerosene and gasoline in this exploration area, it also supplies a part to other exploration areas.

    In Qaidam, several large oil fields like Lenghu have been discovered. On the Shizigou structure in the Yushashan exploration area, an exploration well spewed crude oil as high as a four-story building. At the Youquanzi exploration area, the crude oil spewed from a well in five hours required 125 Liberation brand trucks to transport it. No wonder the oil workers here say that Qaidam is a veritable "sea of ​​oil".

			Gobi Gasification City
    Natural gas is a treasure of Qaidam. Three large gas fields have been discovered in Qaidam. People say that Mahai is a gasification city on the Gobi Desert. Arriving here, the first thing that catches your eye is the small steel pipes all over the ground like a net. Natural gas is transported from these pipes to hundreds of tents and adobe houses to provide people with heating, cooking, boiling water, and steelmaking.

    Mahai is a petroleum exploration base. However, when drilling wells in the Mahai structure, what came out first was not crude oil but natural gas. When this well was drilled to the gas layer, the sound of the gas spewing was like the roaring of beasts, which could be heard within a radius of seven or eight kilometers. The drillers fought for several days before subduing the gas field, installing a gas pipeline, and letting natural gas serve exploration.

    Natural gas has been widely used here in all aspects. The power needed for exploration is generated by natural gas. Car drivers use natural gas to drive. Welders pioneered the use of natural gas to replace acetylene for welding and cutting metal in our country. People have also launched a mass movement to manufacture carbon black using natural gas.

    Although the Mahai exploration team uses natural gas for both production and living, the daily consumption is only one-thirtieth of the daily output of this well. A large gas pipeline is being designed. Soon, the natural gas here will be transported to Da Qaidan, so that the capital of Qaidam will also become a gasification city.

    The Mahai gas field is still the smallest of the three gas fields, and the other two are three or four times larger than it.

			Nationally Famous Lead-Zinc Mine
    Last spring, Qaidam shipped out its first batch of ore—the lead-zinc ore from Xitieshan. When trains marked with "Qaidam Ore" passed through Northwest and North China to Northeast China, they attracted the attention of many people along the way. Since then, Qaidam's lead-zinc ore has become famous throughout the country, and many places have requested to order supply contracts.

    A small piece of lead-zinc ore from Xitieshan requires two hands to hold it. Here, the three mountains twisted together are the three main ore belts, and mining is like digging mountains. The reserves are very abundant, and there are more than a dozen associated metal minerals.

    At the beginning of last year, the Qaidam Administrative Committee sent more than 20 people to collect the ore dug out during exploration. They found that the ore here was too easy to mine, so they requested approval to formally establish a production team to mine under the principle of not destroying the main ore body and not affecting large-scale mining in the future. This production team grew from small to large, starting from scratch, and has now grown to 1,600 people. It mines 100,000 tons of ore a year and also uses indigenous methods to refine lead and zinc.

    The day when this treasure mountain will offer its treasures to socialism on a large scale is coming soon. A joint factory including mining, ore dressing, and smelting has begun construction. The people of Xitieshan like to say this to outsiders: Please note, don’t fail to recognize this place when you come again!

				Lakeside Factory
    Maybe you haven't heard of building a factory on a lake. Qaidam has several such wonderful factories. The Chaerhan Potash Fertilizer Factory is the largest of them. This potash fertilizer factory is built on the Chaerhan Salt Lake in the center of Qaidam. Originally, the lake water contained a lot of salt, and the lake surface formed a thick and solid salt crust. One square meter of salt crust could withstand a weight of 42.5 tons, which is twice as strong as the compressive strength of ordinary soil. There is no need to worry about building houses and driving cars on the lake surface. This factory was built in August last year, and now there are 400 tents, mobile houses, and houses built with salt blocks, and 5,000 male and female workers. A few months ago, this place was still deserted, but today, it has become a lakeside city.

    The workers pry open the salt crust on the lake, dig up the carnallite ore, and vibrate it in the water to make the potassium salt suspended in the water. Clarify the water, take out the precipitate, filter it under pressure, and dry it to obtain potash fertilizer containing more than 55% potassium chloride. At present, workers are still producing using indigenous methods and are preparing to gradually switch to mechanical production, striving to produce 200,000 tons of potash fertilizer this year.

    The workers are also gradually expanding permanent factory buildings—using bricks and wood to make house pillars and frames, and chiseling the salt crust into square blocks to build walls. They laid a light railway track to transport salt blocks and also opened an eight-kilometer-long waterway to transport ore—prying open the salt crust, scooping out one and a half meters deep of salt residue, and salt water emerges to form a "canal" that does not freeze in the cold winter. Outsiders, looking at the vigorous development scene here, watching male and female workers produce while singing, watching wooden boats come and go in the canal to send ore, and dump trucks rumbling past carrying salt blocks, they really can't imagine that they are in the lake, digging down one meter deep and it is salt water.

				Qaidam Granary
    If anyone thinks that Qaidam only has rich mineral deposits and is not suitable for developing agriculture, then they do not understand Qaidam. Qaidam has already established 17 farms, and Delingha Farm is the famous "Qaidam Granary".

    Delingha Farm is the earliest reclaimed and largest sown area farm in Qaidam. Last year, a total of more than 70,000 mu were sown. Spring wheat yielded 5,743 jin per mu, highland barley yielded 4,974 jin per mu, and rapeseed yielded 2,161 jin per mu. Not only are there high-yield "satellites", but also large-scale high yields. The average yield per mu of 14,000 mu of wheat in the entire farm exceeded 1,000 jin. Tomatoes, cucumbers, and melons have also been grown here.

    The production units in Qaidam have one characteristic, which is comprehensive development and diversified operations. Delingha Farm is no exception. In March 1954, the first batch of land reclamation personnel set off from Xining, building roads while advancing, and traveling more than 500 kilometers in more than 20 days. In the first year when living and supply were very difficult, they reclaimed more than 20,000 mu of wasteland. Later, the reclaimed area gradually expanded, the soil was improved year by year, and grain production also increased year by year. Now, as soon as people enter the farm, they see roads crisscrossing, canals like nets, and herds of cattle and sheep. There are also factories and postal and telecommunications, trade, banks and other institutions. It has initially taken the form of a comprehensive production city.

			The Basin Extends Its Enthusiastic Arms
    The treasures in the Treasure Bowl are countless, and the flowers are more than these few. The exploration work in recent years has enabled Qaidam to move from simple exploration to a new stage of exploration and development simultaneously. Many large-scale factories and mining enterprises are being built. In order to change the face of Qaidam, tens of thousands of pioneers have sown seeds here. Their sweat is sprinkled on the Gobi Desert, which emits the fragrance of oil, and on the snow peaks of the Kunlun Mountains. For a better tomorrow, more heroes are needed to join this heroic rank. Patriotic sons and daughters of the motherland who are determined to develop Qaidam, come to the basin! The Kunlun Mountains are nodding to you, and Qaidam is extending its arms to you, she will enthusiastically embrace you. (Attached picture)

    聚宝盆里鲜花开
    本报记者　杨立本　李景瑞　邢克忠
    说柴达木盆地是祖国的“聚宝盆”，是再恰当也没有了。这块大致等于英国本土面积的地区，虽然只查勘了一部分，富饶的宝藏却已露出来了。几年来，从全国各地前来十几万好儿女，在全国人民的支援下，边勘探、边开发，盆地已经初开建设之花，聚宝盆开始为祖国的社会主义建设献宝了。
              冷湖——油湖
    柴达木北部横亘着终年积雪的当金山。山下有一块方圆几百公里的戈壁滩，井架耸立，车辆来往，这就是著名的冷湖探区。“冷湖”，这是地质人员起的名字。因为他们在这儿发现一个小湖，加上气候冷，把这一带地方叫“冷湖”。如今，这里的人们都自豪地说：冷湖成了油湖了。
    从冷湖基地向南走二十公里，有一抹起伏的山岗。这是冷湖五号构造。在山坡上，人工筑堤挡成了一连串的油湖。从去年9月第四号井喷油起，连续有六口探井喷出大量原油，日喷量都在二百吨以上，最多的达八百吨。原油多得无处存放，就在凹地汇集成湖。连水鸭还飞到“湖”里找东西吃哩！现在，五号构造地区已经成为一座有三千居民的新城。这里集中了十几个最优秀的钻井队，展开了冷湖“大会战”，要在最短期间探明这个大油田的面积和储量。喷油的探井都成了生产井。满装原油的油罐车，不断地从这里驶出。这个探区的一座炼油厂，就是用五号构造的原油提炼的。它除了保证这个探区的煤油、汽油自给外，还供给其他探区一部分。
    在柴达木，像冷湖这样的大油田已发现了好几个。油砂山探区的狮子沟构造上，有一口探井喷出的原油有四层楼高。油泉子探区有一口井五小时喷出的原油，要一百二十五辆解放牌卡车才运完。难怪这里的石油工人都说，柴达木是一个名符其实的“油海”。
            戈壁滩上气化城
    天然气是柴达木的一宝。柴达木已经发现三个大气田。人们都说马海是戈壁滩上的气化城。来到这里，最先引人注意的是遍地如网的小钢管。天然气就从这些管子输送到几百座帐篷和土房里，供给人们取暖、煮饭、烧水、炼钢铁用。
    马海是一个石油勘探基地。但在马海构造打井，首先钻出来的不是原油而是天然气。当这口井钻到气层时，喷气的声音如群兽齐吼，在方圆七、八公里内都听到。钻工们奋战了好几天才把这个气田驯服，装上输气管，让天然气为勘探服务。
    天然气在这里已经广泛地利用到各方面。勘探需要的动力是用天然气发电的。汽车司机用天然气开车。焊工首创我国用天然气代替乙炔焊割金属。人们还开展了群众性的用天然气制造碳黑。
    尽管马海勘探大队的生产和生活都用上了天然气，但每天消耗量还只有这口井日产量的三十分之一。一条大型的输气管正在设计。不久，这里的天然气将输送到大柴旦去，让柴达木的首府也成为一座气化城。
    马海气田，还是三个气田中的最小的，另外两个都比它大三、四倍呢。
          名扬全国的铅锌矿
    去年春天，柴达木运出了第一批矿石——锡铁山的铅锌矿。当标着“柴达木矿石”的列车浩浩荡荡经过西北、华北去东北时，一路上就引起很多人的注意。从此，柴达木的铅锌矿就在全国出了名，许多地方都要求订供应合同。
    锡铁山的铅锌矿石，一小块就得用两只手才能捧起来。这里，紧扭在一起的三条山就是三条主矿带，开矿就是挖山。储量很丰，伴生的金属矿还有十几种。
    去年年初，柴达木行政委员会派了二十多人来拾取勘探时挖出来的矿石。他们发现这里的矿石太好开采了，就请求批准正式成立生产队，在不破坏主矿体和不影响今后大规模开采的原则下采矿。这个生产队由小到大，白手起家，现在已经发展到一千六百人，一年开采了十万吨矿石，还用土法炼出了铅和锌。
    这座宝山大量向社会主义献宝的日子快到了。一座包括采矿、选矿和冶炼的联合工厂已开始兴建。锡铁山的人们爱对外来的人讲这样一句话：请注意，再来时不要认不出这个地方！
                湖上工厂
    也许你没有听过湖上建工厂的事。柴达木就有好几座这样奇妙的工厂。察尔汗钾肥厂是其中最大的一座。这座钾肥厂建筑在柴达木中心的察尔汗盐湖上。原来，湖水含盐极多，湖面结成了一层又厚又结实的盐盖，一平方公尺盐盖承受住重力四十二吨半，比一般土质的抗压能力还强一倍。在湖面建房子、开汽车是用不着担心的。这个厂去年8月兴建，现在已有四百座账篷、活动房屋和盐块盖的房子，有五千名男女工人。几个月以前，这里还荒芜人烟，今天，俨然形成一座湖上城市了。
    工人们在湖上把盐盖撬开，挖取光卤石矿在水中振荡，使其中的钾盐悬浮在水中。把水澄清，取出沉淀物压滤、晾干，便是含氯化钾55％以上的钾肥。目前工人们还用土法生产，准备逐步改用机械生产，今年争取生产二十万吨钾肥。
    工人们还在逐步扩建永久性的厂房——用砖和木材做房柱房架，把盐盖凿成方块砌墙。他们铺了一条轻便铁轨运送盐块，还开了一条八公里长的水道运矿石——把盐盖撬开，捞净一公尺半深的盐渣，盐水就冒出来形成一条寒冬不冻的“运河”。外来的人，看着这里蓬蓬勃勃的发展景象，看着男女工人在歌唱中生产，看着木船在运河中往来送矿石，斗车载着盐块隆隆驶过，真想不到是置身湖上，挖下去一公尺深就是盐水。
              柴达木粮仓
    如果有人认为柴达木只有丰富的矿藏而不适宜于发展农业，那就是不了解柴达木。柴达木已经办起十七个农场，德令哈农场就是著名的“柴达木粮仓”。
    德令哈农场是柴达木开垦最早、播种面积最大的农场。去年共播种七万多亩，春小麦有一亩产到五千七百四十三斤的，青稞有一亩四千九百七十四斤的，油菜籽有一亩二千一百六十一斤的。不仅有高产“卫星”，还有大面积丰产。全场的一万四千亩小麦平均亩产超过一千斤。这里还种出了西红柿、黄瓜和甜瓜。
    柴达木的生产单位都有一个特点，就是全面开发，多种经营。德令哈农场也不例外。1954年3月，第一批垦荒人员从西宁出发，边修路边前进，五百多公里走了二十多天。他们在居住和供应都很困难的第一年，就垦荒二万多亩。以后，垦区逐渐扩大，土壤逐年改良，粮食产量也逐年上升。现在，人们一走进农场，就看到公路纵横，水渠如网，牛羊成群。还有工厂和邮电、贸易、银行等机构。她已经初具综合性生产城市的雏形。
        盆地伸出热情的臂膀
    聚宝盆里的宝藏数不完，鲜花何止这几支？几年来的勘察工作，使得柴达木由单纯的勘探迈进到边勘探边开发的新阶段。许多大型的厂矿企业正在着手兴建。为了改变柴达木的面貌，十几万先行者已经在这里播下了种子。他们的汗珠撒在散发着油香的戈壁滩里，撒在昆仑山的雪峰上。为了更加美好的明天，还需要更多的英雄加入这个英雄的行列。有志开发柴达木的祖国好儿女们，到盆地来吧！昆仑山在向你们点头，柴达木向你们伸开了臂膀，她将热情地拥抱你们。（附图片）
    谁说冷湖没有油？请到此处来一游；日喷原油八百吨，聚成油湖清悠悠。
