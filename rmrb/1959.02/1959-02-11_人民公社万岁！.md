Long Live the People's Commune!

The manuscripts published here include some odes to the people's communes by members of the people's communes collected from various provincial newspapers. These ordinary laborers range in age from elderly people in their seventies to young people in their twenties; in terms of gender, there are men and women; in terms of region, they come from all over the country. As we celebrate the Spring Festival, let us once again listen to this chorus of cheers, let it inspire enthusiasm, and accelerate our pace of construction! Let the fools like Dulles once again hear the Chinese people's loud answer to their slanders!

Hundreds of millions of people share the same sentiment, and everyone says, "The people's commune is good!"

"The people's commune is good!" Our peasants, workers, youth, elderly, women, and fraternal ethnic groups – our 600 million people say this loudly in unison. Because after the people's commune was established, the new relations of production greatly promoted the development of productive forces. On the basis of last year's bumper agricultural harvest, the vast rural areas realized that meals don't cost money. The Chinese peasants, who have been worried about food and drink and not being able to keep warm for thousands of years, have further obtained the most important and reliable social insurance. Because of the people's commune, the vast majority of peasants have increased their income; because of the people's commune, the ideal of "the old are provided for, and the young are cared for" has been realized; because of the people's commune, women's labor force has been completely liberated; because the people's commune was only half a year old, it won the victory of bumper harvests of grain and cotton and the victory of the whole people running iron and steel for us; because of the people's commune, we are marching on the broad road of socialism and seeing a better future.

The fact that the people's commune is good cannot but frighten our enemies. Dulles is one of the most frightened. Last autumn, he shouted hoarsely that we had destroyed the family system that had been handed down for thousands of years and was supposedly very good. The new families full of joy, democracy, and unity in the people's commune gave him a resounding slap in the face. However, recently he has been playing new tricks, and he is again slandering us for treating people as beasts. He says that we "work eighteen hours a day, and men, women, and children are forcibly separated." Encouraged by the heroic slogan of "fighting hard for three years to change our appearance," many commune members with socialist consciousness often voluntarily work overtime. However, our Party has always been the most concerned about people. In the past, Comrade Mao Zedong often asked Party cadres to care about the lives of the masses. Now, the Party Central Committee has stipulated in the resolution on the people's communes that we should work eight hours and study two hours every day; during the busy farming season, we must ensure four hours for meals and rest, and at least eight hours for sleep. Many people's communes have already implemented vacation and work-rest systems. Is this kind of close care for people imaginable for Chinese peasants who were oppressed by landlords in the past? We are launching a tool reform and technological innovation movement to reduce heavy manual labor as much as possible. However, Dulles, with his granite head, certainly does not want to see these things. Moreover, he has forgotten that right beside him, the more than four million unemployed people in the United States have no work, no adequate food, clothing, or housing every day. Perhaps this is the respect that Dulles talks about that doesn't treat them the same as beasts. The families of American unemployed people sit together with furrowed brows, and the children cry from hunger. Perhaps this is the happy and free family life that Dulles talks about.

The working class fighter Bebel said it well: "If the enemy praises you, it is probably because you have done something stupid." Conversely, if the enemy slanders and defames you, it means that what you have done is very good!

The people's commune is such a good social organization that the enemy attacks it with all their might, and the people praise it to the extreme. Can the slanders and defamations of Dulles and his ilk destroy the people's commune that hundreds of millions of people support?

Our people's commune is only half a year old, but this rising sun, with its initial rays, brings boundless good spring to our people. Look, listen, from the coast of the East China Sea to the western grasslands, from Wuzhi Mountain to the Greater Khingan Range, on this vast and beautiful land, 600 million people are singing loudly that the people's commune is good. They are laughing, and the rising sun is even making our mountains and rivers laugh. Now, this sun is rising higher and higher. After rectification, consolidation, and improvement, the people's commune will be even more radiant.

Long Live the People's Commune!

    人民公社万岁！
    这里发表的稿件，有一部分是从各省报纸上搜集来的一些人民公社社员对人民公社的颂歌。这些普通劳动者，从年龄上来说，有七十多岁的老人，也有二十多岁的青年；从性别上来说，有男的、也有女的；从地区上来说，东西南北都有。让我们在欢度春节的时候，再一次听听这一片欢呼声，让它鼓舞干劲，加速我们建设的步伐吧！也让杜勒斯之流的蠢人们，再一次地听听中国人民响亮地回答他们的诽谤吧！
    亿万人人同此心，心同此理，大家都说：“人民公社好！”
    “人民公社好！”我们的农民、工人、青年、老人、妇女和兄弟民族——我们六亿人民齐声嘹亮地这样说。因为人民公社化以后，新的生产关系大大地促进了生产力的发展，在去年农业大丰收的基础上，广大农村实现了吃饭不要钱，几千年愁吃愁喝、不得温饱的中国农民，进一步得到了最重要最可靠的社会保险；因为人民公社化，使绝大多数农民增加了收入；因为人民公社化，实现了“老有所终、幼有所养”的理想；因为人民公社化，彻底解放了妇女劳动力；因为人民公社诞生仅只半岁，就为我们取得了粮棉大丰收的胜利，全民办钢铁的胜利；因为人民公社化，使我们行进在社会主义的康庄大道上，看到了更加美好的未来。
    人民公社好，这对我们的敌人来说，不能不使他们感到害怕。杜勒斯就是最害怕的一个。去年秋天，他力竭声嘶地说我们破坏了几千年传下来的据说是好的不得了的家庭制度。人民公社里的充满了欢乐的民主团结的新家庭，给了他一记清脆的耳光。然而，最近他又在耍新的花招，又在污蔑我们把人当牛马，他说我们“一天工作十八小时，男子、妇女和儿童被强行分开。”我们中国人民在“苦战三年，改变面貌”这一英勇口号的鼓舞下，有很多有着社会主义觉悟的公社社员，往往自发地加班加点，然而，我们的党从来是最懂得关心人的。过去，毛泽东同志经常要党的干部关心群众生活，现在，党中央更在关于人民公社的决议里，规定了每天工作八小时、学习二小时；农忙时必须保证吃饭休息四小时，睡眠至少八小时。很多人民公社已经实行了放假和作息制度。这种对人的亲切关怀，难道是过去在地主压迫下的中国农民可以想像得到的吗？我们正在展开工具改革、技术革新运动，以便尽可能减轻笨重的体力劳动。可是，有着花岗岩脑袋的杜勒斯，当然不愿意看到这些的。而且，他还忘掉就在他自己身边，美国的四百多万失业者，每天没有工作，没有足够的食物、衣服和住房，大概这就是杜勒斯嘴里的不把他们和牛马同等看待的一种尊敬。美国失业者的家庭，夫妇坐在一起愁眉苦脸，孩子在一旁饿的啼哭，大概这就是杜勒斯嘴里的美满自由的家庭生活。
    工人阶级的战士倍倍尔说得好：“如果敌人夸奖你的话，那大概是你做了什么愚蠢的事情。”反过来，如果敌人污蔑、诽谤你，那就说明你做的事情好得很！
    人民公社，就是这样一个敌人下死劲攻击，人民极力夸赞的好得很的社会组织。杜勒斯之流的诽谤和污蔑，难道能破坏亿万人民拥护的人民公社？
    我们人民公社的年龄，还只有半岁，但这初升的太阳初吐光芒，就给我们人民带来了无限好的春光。看吧，听吧，从东海之滨到西部草原，从五指山到大兴安岭，在这宽广美丽的土地上，六亿人民在高声歌唱人民公社好，他们在欢笑，初升的太阳，甚至使我们的山河也在欢笑了。现在，这太阳正在越升越高，人民公社经过整顿、巩固和提高后，将更加光芒万丈。
    人民公社万岁！
