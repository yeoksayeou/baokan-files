Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The People of All Circles in the Capital Held a Congress to Support the Cameroon People's Struggle for National Independence, and sent the following telegram to the People of Cameroon: To the Representative of Cameroon stationed at the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council in Cairo, forwarded to the People of Cameroon:

　　The people of all circles in the capital of the People's Republic of China solemnly convened a meeting on February 18, 1959, to firmly support the just struggle of the Cameroonian people against colonial rule and for national independence, and to pay the highest respect to the heroic Cameroonian people.

　　The Chinese people feel extremely angry at the cruel exploitation and bloody suppression carried out by the French and British colonialists in Cameroon. We sternly condemn this barbaric act by the French and British colonialists. We believe that the French and British governments must recognize the independence and national sovereignty of the Cameroonian people without delay, and must immediately end their criminal colonial rule over the Cameroonian people. We believe that the "trusteeship system" self-proclaimed by the imperialist bandits must be ended immediately, and complete independence must be returned to the Cameroonian people.

　　The Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Cameroonian people for independence and freedom, and resolutely support the just struggle of the African people for independence and freedom. In the struggle against imperialism and colonialism, we will always stand with the Cameroonian and African people. We firmly believe that in today's world, with the growing strength of peaceful forces and the unprecedented awakening of the African people, as long as we strengthen unity, overcome difficulties, make persistent efforts, and persevere in the struggle, we will surely overthrow the rule of imperialism. Final victory will surely belong to the heroic Cameroonian people, and surely belong to the great African people!

    新华社18日讯　首都各界人民支持喀麦隆人民争取民族独立斗争大会致喀麦隆人民电，全文如下：开罗喀麦隆驻亚非人民团结理事会代表转致喀麦隆人民：
    中华人民共和国首都各界人民，于1959年2月18日隆重举行集会，坚决支持喀麦隆人民反对殖民统治，争取民族独立的正义斗争，并向英勇奋斗的喀麦隆人民致以崇高的敬意。
    中国人民对法英殖民主义者在喀麦隆进行的残酷剥削和血腥镇压感到无比愤怒，我们严正谴责法英殖民主义者的这种野蛮行为。我们认为法英政府必须毫不迟延地承认喀麦隆人民的独立和民族主权，必须立即结束它们对喀麦隆人民的罪恶的殖民统治。我们认为帝国主义强盗自封的“托管制度”必须立即结束，还给喀麦隆人民完全的独立。
    中国人民坚决支持喀麦隆人民争取独立自由的正义斗争，坚决支持非洲人民争取独立自由的正义斗争。在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中，我们永远与喀麦隆和非洲人民站在一起。我们深信，在和平力量日益强大和非洲人民空前觉醒的今天，只要加强团结、克服困难、再接再厉、坚持斗争，就一定能推翻帝国主义的统治。最后胜利必定属于英勇的喀麦隆人民，必定属于伟大的非洲人民！
