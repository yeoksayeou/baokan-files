Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, February 12th: The Yongle Palace murals in Ruicheng County (formerly Yongji County), Shanxi Province, renowned throughout the country for their exquisite ancient art, are currently being excavated by experts, engineers, technicians, and workers from the Ancient Architecture Renovation Institute of Beijing. After this work is completed, they will be completely repaired and restored in the rebuilt Yongle Palace.

The Yongle Palace is located within the area of the Sanmenxia Reservoir. After the construction of the Sanmenxia Project began, in order to preserve this precious cultural heritage, the Ministry of Culture and the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee decided to relocate the Yongle Palace outside the reservoir area and rebuild it according to its original appearance. The relevant units were also instructed to establish a relocation committee, instructing them to properly excavate all the murals, safely relocate them to the new site, and repair and restore them. The Yongle Palace murals total 960 square meters. Excavating so many huge murals (the largest being 6 square meters) is a delicate and complex task. Under the support of the Party, the ancient architecture renovation experts, engineers, technicians, and workers displayed both meticulousness and a spirit of daring to create, and after repeated research, they finally successfully tested a set of excavation methods. They are currently working day and night to complete everything by the end of June.

The Yongle Palace was built in the middle of the 13th century and is one of the oldest existing Taoist buildings in China. According to legend, it is the former residence of Lü Dongbin, one of the Eight Immortals. The Yongle Palace currently has five buildings: the Mountain Gate, the Wuji Gate, the Sanqing Hall, the Chunyang Hall, and the Chongyang Hall. Each hall contains magnificent murals. These murals are grand in scale, the figures are vivid and expressive, and the themes are rich and colorful, comparable to the art of Dunhuang, and are valuable materials for studying social life in the Yuan Dynasty.

    揭取珍贵壁画　迁离水库地区
    永乐宫准备大搬家
    新华社太原12日电　以优美的古代艺术闻名全国的山西省芮城县（原永济县）永乐宫壁画，现在正由来自北京的古代建筑修整所的专家、工程技术人员和工人们进行揭取工作。待这项工作完毕后，将完整地在重建的永乐宫里修补复原。
    永乐宫地处三门峡水库区域内。三门峡工程兴建开始后，为了保存这种珍贵的文化遗产，文化部和山西省人民委员会就决定将永乐宫迁出水库地区以外，按原样重建。并且责成有关单位成立了迁建委员会，指示把所有的壁画妥善地揭取下来，安全迁到新址，修补复原。永乐宫的壁画共有九百六十平方公尺，把这么多的巨幅壁画（最大的达六平方公尺）揭取下来，是一项细致复杂的工作。古代建筑修整专家、工程技术人员和工人们在党的支持下，发挥了既细心又敢于创造的精神，经过反复多次的研究，终于试验成功了一套揭取方法。目前他们正在夜以继日地紧张工作着，争取在6月底全部完成。
    永乐宫建于十三世纪的中叶，是我国现存最早的道教建筑之一，相传是八仙之一的吕洞宾的故居。永乐宫现有山门、无极门、三清殿、纯阳殿、重阳殿等五进建筑。每个殿中都有金碧辉煌的壁画。这些壁画规模宏伟，人物传神达意，题材丰富多彩，可与敦煌艺术媲美，是研究元代社会生活的有价值的资料。
