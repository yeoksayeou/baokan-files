    Czech "Red Right News" Reprimands Yugoslav "Combat News"
    Lies Cannot Conceal the True Face of Revisionism
    Xinhua News Agency, 5th - The Czechoslovakian "Red Right News" recently published a commentary, sternly refuting the Yugoslavian "Combat News'" January 30th attack and slander against Khrushchev's report at the 21st Congress of the CPSU. The commentary said that the Yugoslavian newspaper cannot erase the fact that representatives of seventy Communist and Workers' Parties participated in the 21st Congress of the CPSU. Therefore, many members of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia who are aware that proletarian internationalism is the fundamental characteristic of communists will ask: Why did the Yugoslav party not have representatives participate in this important congress? Faced with the indestructible unity of the international communist movement, "Combat News" has not been able to answer readers' questions about the so-called "proletarian internationalism" of the Yugoslav communist leaders. The commentary pointed out that the Yugoslav newspaper attempts to use fabricated facts to "prove" that the Communist Parties of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist camp countries, as well as the Marxist-Leninist parties in capitalist countries that are firmly united with international communism, are enemies of Yugoslavia, and to oppose all Communist parties' correct criticism of revisionism.
    In refuting "Combat News'" argument that the situation of the working people in Yugoslavia is superior to that of the working people in socialist countries, "Red Right News" wrote that, regarding this point, it is enough to mention the fact that rich peasants and merchants in Yugoslavia can still massively exploit hired laborers to this day.
    In commenting on "Combat News'" lie that the economic reorganizations and decentralization of power recently implemented in socialist countries are actually imitating the Yugoslav system, "Red Right News" pointed out that this decentralization is essentially different from the Yugoslav approach. It maintains and strengthens the central planning and leadership of the national economy, without creating laissez-faire. Laissez-faire is precisely the hidden ailment of the Yugoslav economy and the root of its insurmountable difficulties.
    The commentary also exposed the Yugoslav newspaper's foolish attempt to use outdated and inaccurate statistics from the United Nations archives to prove that Yugoslavia ranks first in Europe in terms of the speed of industrial development. The commentary pointed out that even many Yugoslav economic workers are apparently surprised by this argument, because they are familiar with the truth of the facts.
    The commentary concluded by saying that the hostility of the article's author is particularly exposed when "Combat News'" article uses attacks to respond to the criticisms of various Communist parties regarding Yugoslavia's agricultural policy. When Soviet agriculture is catching up with and surpassing the agricultural production level of the United States at an astonishing rate, the author dares to talk about the so-called "collapse" of the Soviet collectivization policy and tout the Yugoslav cooperatives. However, it is well known that in such cooperatives in Yugoslavia, the private sector component is much larger than the socialist component.

    捷“红色权利报”斥南“战斗报”
    谎言掩饰不了修正主义的本相
    新华社5日讯　捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”最近发表评论，严正驳斥南斯拉夫“战斗报”1月30日对赫鲁晓夫在苏共第二十一次代表大会上所作的报告的攻击和污蔑。评论说，南斯拉夫报纸无法抹杀有七十个共产党和工人党的代表参加苏共第二十一次代表大会这个事实。因而，许多意识到无产阶级国际主义是共产党人的基本特色的南共党员们就会提疑问：为什么南斯拉夫的党没有代表参加这个重要的代表大会呢？在国际共产主义运动的不可摧毁的团结面前，“战斗报”没有能够回答读者对南共领导人的所谓“无产阶级国际主义”的疑问。评论指出，南斯拉夫报纸企图用捏造的事实来“证明”苏联、中国和社会主义阵营其它各国的共产党，以及坚定地同国际共产主义团结在一起的资本主义国家的马克思列宁主义政党是南斯拉夫的敌人，并以此来反对所有共产党对修正主义的正确批评。
    “红色权利报”在驳斥“战斗报”关于南斯拉夫劳动人民的境况比社会主义阵营各国劳动人民优越的论调时写道，关于这一点，只需提一下在南斯拉夫的富农和商人迄今还能大量对雇佣劳动者进行剥削这一事实就够了。
    在评论“战斗报”关于最近社会主义国家实行的经济改组和权力下放实际上是模仿南斯拉夫的制度这一谎言时，“红色权利报”指出，这种权力下放同南斯拉夫的做法有本质的区别。它保持和增强了中央对国民经济的计划和领导，而没有形成自流。而自流正是南斯拉夫经济的隐疾和它不可克服的困难的根源。
    评论也揭露了南斯拉夫报纸利用联合国档案中过时的、不确实的统计来证明在工业发展的速度上南斯拉夫占欧洲第一位的愚蠢企图。评论指出，这个论断就连许多南斯拉夫的经济工作者也显然感到吃惊，因为他们是熟知事实的真象的。
    评论最后说，在“战斗报”的文章用攻击来回答各国共产党对南斯拉夫农业政策的批评时，特别暴露出文章作者的敌意。当苏联的农业以惊人的速度赶上和超过美国的农业生产水平的时候，作者竟敢谈论所谓苏联集体化政策的“崩溃”，并吹嘘南斯拉夫的合作社。但是，众所周知，在南斯拉夫这种合作社中，私人经营的成分要比社会主义成分大得多。
