    Embroidering Dragons and Phoenixes on the Earth
    In the north, spring plowing will begin soon. This year is a year of even greater leap forward in agricultural production. Look at the meticulous preparations made by the members of the Dongfeng People's Commune in Anguo, Hebei, for the high-yield cotton fields: The land is as flat as water; the ridges are as straight as lines. Canals run across, ensuring proper irrigation at the right time. Piles of soil are constantly added to the ground, indicating that manure spreading has already begun. Production work is becoming more and more detailed, so there is no worry that the earth will not yield even more abundant products this year!

    在大地上描龙绣凤
    在北方，不久就要开始春耕了。今年是农业生产更大跃进的一年，你看，河北安国东风人民公社的社员为棉花丰产田作了多么周到的准备工作：那地，一平如水；那埂，挺直如线。水渠横穿而过，可以保证灌溉适量适时。地面上不断地增加着一个个土堆，原来是已经开始送粪了。生产工作越来越作得细致，不愁大地今年不拿出更加丰硕的产品！                        本报记者  齐观山摄
