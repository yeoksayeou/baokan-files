Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 4th (TASS dispatch): Kirilenko, alternate member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, delivered a speech at the 21st Congress of the CPSU on the afternoon of January 28.

Comrade Kirilenko said: The Soviet people have the right to regard the Seven-Year Plan as a miraculous fusion of the bold creation, wise consideration, and inspiring ideals of the Soviet people striving for their precious happiness—communism. The working people regard this plan as the embodiment of the immortal Lenin's legacy. Every figure in the plan is permeated with care for the people, for the people's material welfare, and for the development of their spiritual strength.

Kirilenko said that the Soviet people and our foreign friends are incredibly excited and proud because our country, with its Seven-Year Plan, once again demonstrates the great and indisputable superiority of the socialist system, its endless vitality, and its ability to defeat the capitalist system in peaceful economic competition.

During the years of Soviet power, the Sverdlovsk Oblast has become a huge industrial and scientific base for the country. The industrial output of this oblast has increased seventy-nine times compared to 1913, while the output of machine manufacturing and metal processing industries has increased eight hundred times. The work after the 20th Congress of the Party has been particularly smooth. The increase in product output alone is 50% more than the pre-war 1940 production. In three years, the machine manufacturers of Sverdlovsk have designed and mastered more than five hundred kinds of new machines, instruments, and equipment, including such outstanding machines as a large primary rolling mill with an annual production capacity of three million tons of steel; a self-propelled excavator with a bucket capacity of twenty-five cubic meters and a boom length of one hundred meters; and a combined machine for drilling shafts with a diameter of six and a half meters for mining.

During this period, the working people of this oblast obtained residential space of more than four million square meters.

Comrade Kirilenko continued, but in industry and construction, there are still situations where equipment often stalls, non-productive expenditures are wasted, losses are caused by defective products, manual labor is used extensively, and the solution of many technical improvement problems is slow. The Party organization has noticed and made all working people pay attention to eliminating all shortcomings as soon as possible, and to pay attention to the faster development of the oblast's productive forces in the future.

Within seven years, the industrial output of Sverdlovsk's enterprises will increase by at least 65%, and labor productivity will increase by 54%-56%. The total investment in capital construction alone in new and rebuilt factories will exceed 40 billion rubles, which is more than the total investment in the past fifteen years.

During the discussion of Comrade Khrushchev's report outline, the working people of the entire oblast put forward many suggestions on increasing product production. Among them, it was suggested that the production of pig iron should be increased by two million tons more than stipulated in the draft of the Soviet national plan, and the production of steel and steel products should also be increased accordingly. For this purpose, it is necessary to solve the development problem of the second phase of the Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical Combine and the Kachkanar Mining and Processing Combine. Calculations show that such a decision is beneficial, because the investment and cost per ton of metal are 25% lower than those of other designed enterprises.

Suggestions were also made to increase the production of aluminum and copper by expanding the existing factories in the oblast, so that the output would be at least doubled. At the same time, the cost of metal will be lower than the cost planned in new enterprises. These potentials should not be ignored.

Comrade Kirilenko said that in the next seven years, the Ural Machine-Building Plant will produce automated large primary rolling mills, which will ensure an unprecedented level of productivity. It will also produce self-propelled excavators with a bucket capacity of fifty cubic meters and a boom length of one hundred and twenty-five meters. The Ural Electrical Equipment Factory will manufacture the country's largest 300,000-kilowatt hydraulic generating units for the Krasnoyarsk Hydropower Station. It is planned to design more than 150 kinds of new machines and equipment for the chemical industry.

It is planned to further develop the construction industry in the oblast. In seven years, more than eleven million square meters of housing will be built, which is equivalent to the total housing area built in the past thirty years.

Kirilenko said that this oblast has also made significant achievements in the development of agriculture. However, the production level of agricultural products is far from meeting the needs. In response to the call of the agricultural workers of Ryazan Oblast, the working people of the entire oblast have decided to increase the meat production of collective farms and state farms by 1.2 times this year, and will greatly increase the production of milk and eggs. This year, the average meat production per hundred hectares of agricultural land will reach 78 quintals, and milk will reach 284 quintals.

Kirilenko concluded by saying that the Sverdlovsk Party organization is welcoming the 21st Congress of the Party with unprecedented unity and readiness to complete all the tasks assigned by the Party and the government. (Attached image)

    在苏共二十一次代表大会上
    基里连科的发言
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社莫斯科1月29日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会主席团候补委员基里连科1月28日下午在苏共第二十一次代表大会上发了言。
    基里连科同志说：苏联人民有权认为七年计划是为自己珍贵的幸福——共产主义而奋斗的苏联人民的大胆创造、英明考虑和令人鼓舞的理想的奇迹般的熔合。劳动人民认为这一计划是不朽的列宁遗训的体现。计划的每一个数字都渗透着对人民、对人民的物质福利以及对他们的精神力量的发展的关怀。
    基里连科说，苏联人民和我们的外国朋友们感到无比兴奋和骄傲，因为我们国家以它的七年计划再次显示出社会主义制度伟大的无可争辩的优越性，它的无穷无尽的活力以及在和平经济竞赛中战胜资本主义制度的能力。
    在苏维埃政权年代里，斯维德洛夫斯克州变成了国家巨大的工业基地和科学基地。这个州的工业产品产量增加到了1913年的七十九倍，而机器制造和金属加工业的产品则增加到八百倍。党的第二十次代表大会以后的工作进行得特别顺利。仅仅产品的增长额就比战前1940年的生产额多50％。在三年内，斯维德洛夫斯克的机器制造者们设计并掌握了五百种以上的新式机器、仪器和设备，其中包括这样一些突出的机器，如年产能力为三百万吨钢材的大型初轧机；铲斗容积为二十五立方公尺、吊臂长一百公尺的自走式掘土机，用来钻掘井筒直径为六点五公尺的矿井的掘进用的组合机器。
    这个州的劳动人民在这一时期内获得了居住面积为四百多万平方公尺的住宅。
    基里连科同志接着说，但是在工业和建筑业方面还存在着下面这样的情况：设备常常停歇，非生产性开支有浪费现象，由于废品而造成损失，采用手工劳动很多，许多技术改进问题解决缓慢。党组织注意到并使全体劳动人民都注意尽快地消除一切缺点，注意今后更快地发展州的生产力。
    在七年内斯维德洛夫斯克的企业的工业产品产量至少要增长65％，劳动生产率将提高54％—56％。单是在新建和改建工厂方面的基本建设投资总额就将超过四百亿卢布，比近十五年来的投资总额还多。
    在讨论赫鲁晓夫同志报告提纲的过程中，全州的劳动人民曾经提出了许多关于委员会增加产品生产的建议。其中如建议把生铁产量比苏联国家计划草案中规定的要多增产二百万吨，钢和钢材的生产也要相应地增加。为此需要解决关于下塔吉尔冶金联合企业和卡奇卡纳尔选矿联合企业第二期工程的发展问题。计算结果表明这样的决定是有利的，因为每吨金属的投资和成本比其他设计的企业要低25％。
    还提出了关于增产铝和铜的建议，靠扩建州内现有工厂使产量至少增加一倍。同时，金属的成本将比新企业中计划的成本要低。不应忽视这些潜力。
    基里连科同志说，在今后七年内，乌拉尔机器制造厂将生产自动化的大型初轧机，这种初轧机将保证生产率达到空前的水平。还将生产铲斗容积为五十立方公尺、吊臂长一百二十五公尺的自动推进式掘土机。乌拉尔电气设备工厂将为克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站制造国内最大的三十万瓩的水力联动机。计划为化学工业设计一百五十多种新式机器和设备。
    计划在州内进一步发展建筑工业。七年内，将建造一千一百多万平方公尺的住宅，这相当于过去三十年中建造的住宅面积的总和。
    基里连科说，这个州在农业的发展方面也取得了显著的成绩。但是，农产品的生产水平还远远不能满足需要。全州的劳动人民为了响应梁赞州农业工作者的号召，已经决定在今年把集体农庄和国营农场的肉类产量增加1点2倍，并将大大增加奶类和蛋类的产量。今年，平均每一百公顷农业用地上的肉类产量将达七十八公担，奶类达二百八十四公担。
    基里连科最后说，斯维德洛夫斯克党组织是以空前的团结一致和时刻准备着去完成党和政府交给的一切任务来迎接党的第二十一次代表大会的。（附图片）
