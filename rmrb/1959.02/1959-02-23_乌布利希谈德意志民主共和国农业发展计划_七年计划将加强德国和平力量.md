Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 21st: First Deputy Prime Minister Ulbricht of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) said on the 20th that the GDR is holding high the banner of the German people's national interests. Adenauer's policies have gone bankrupt, and the time is not far off when the majority of the German people will actively fight for the realization of a German peace treaty. Now is the time to defend peace with practical actions. The faster the GDR advances, the more beneficial it will be to the socialist camp.

Ulbricht made these remarks at the Sixth National Conference of Chairmen and Activists of Agricultural Production Cooperatives of the GDR. The conference will focus on discussing the plan for developing agriculture over the next seven years.

In his report to the conference, Ulbricht pointed out that the seven-year plan will strengthen Germany's peace forces, help win over the workers and peasants of West Germany and isolate the militarists, and will make an important contribution to defending peace.

Ulbricht presented the development targets for agricultural production over the next seven years in his report. He said that by 1965, the yield of grain per hectare would reach 3,000 to 3,200 kilograms, the yield of potatoes would reach 24,500 kilograms, and the yield of sugar beets would reach 37,500 kilograms. In terms of livestock and poultry, there would be an average of 39 cows per 100 hectares of arable land, with milk production of 3,500 kilograms per cow, 130 pigs, and 35.6 sheep. He said that these targets would have to be discussed by the farmers and the People's Chamber before a final decision could be made.

When talking about the achievements of agricultural development in 1958, Ulbricht said that the most important achievement was that the agricultural production cooperatives had demonstrated economic superiority over individual farmers. Agricultural production cooperatives surpassed individual farmers in terms of the absolute amount of increased production. He said that this development had already caused a change in the thinking of middle peasants in rural areas.

When talking about the relationship between agricultural production cooperatives and machine tractor stations, Ulbricht said that in villages where all or almost all of the farmers have joined cooperatives, all the technical equipment of the machine tractor stations should be handed over to the management of the agricultural production cooperatives. In this way, the tractor drivers also become members of the agricultural production cooperatives.

Ulbricht also talked about the relationship between industry and agriculture in his report. He requested that the chemical industry supply more artificial fertilizers to support the realization of the seven-year plan.

Ulbricht concluded by saying that with farmers giving full play to their initiative and enthusiasm, the targets of the seven-year plan could be completed ahead of schedule.

    乌布利希谈德意志民主共和国农业发展计划
    七年计划将加强德国和平力量
    新华社柏林21日电　德意志民主共和国第一副总理乌布利希20日说：德意志民主共和国高举着德国人民民族利益的旗帜，阿登纳的政策已经破产，大多数德国人民积极为实现对德和约而斗争的时候已经不远了。现在是以实际行动保卫和平的时候。德意志民主共和国前进得越快，也越有利于社会主义阵营。
    乌布利希是在德意志民主共和国全国第六届农业生产合作社社长和积极分子会议上讲这番话的。这次会议将着重讨论今后七年发展农业的计划。
    乌布利希在向会议所作的报告中指出，七年计划将加强德国的和平力量，有利于争取西德工农群众和孤立军国主义者，并将对保卫和平作出重要贡献。
    乌布列希在报告中提出了今后七年农业生产的发展指标。他说，到1965年，每公顷谷物产量将达到三千到三千二百公斤，马铃薯的产量将达到两万四千五百公斤，甜菜的产量将达到三万七千五百公斤。在牲畜家禽方面，每一百公顷耕地平均有母牛三十九头，每头牛的产奶量达三千五百公斤，猪一百三十头，羊三十五点六头。他说，这些指标还要经过农民和人民议院讨论才能最后决定。
    在谈到1958年农业发展成绩时，乌布利希说，最重要的成就就是农业生产合作社对个体农民显示了经济上的优越性。农业生产合作社在增产的绝对数量上超过了个体农民。他说，这种发展已经引起农村中中农的思想变化。
    在谈到农业生产合作社和机器拖拉机站的关系时，乌布利希说，在全体或几乎全体的农民都参加了合作社的乡村里，要把机器拖拉机站的技术设备全部交给农业生产合作社管理。这样，拖拉机手也成为农业生产合作社的社员。
    乌布利希在报告中还谈到工农业的关系。他要求化学工业供应更多的人造肥料来支持七年计划的实现。
    乌布利希最后说，在农民发挥积极性和主动性的情况下，七年计划的指标将可能提前完成。
