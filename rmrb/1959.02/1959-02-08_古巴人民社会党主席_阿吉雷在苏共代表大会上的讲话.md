Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 6th. "Pravda" published the speech of Comrade Severo Aguirre, Chairman of the National Committee of the People's Socialist Party of Cuba, at the morning session of the 21st Congress of the CPSU on January 31. The full text is as follows:

    Dear Comrades! Please allow me, on behalf of the National Committee of the People's Socialist Party of Cuba and Comrade Blas Roca, the General Secretary, and on behalf of the fighting Cuban people who overthrew the bloody dictatorship of Batista and dealt a heavy blow to imperialism, to extend warm fraternal greetings to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the 21st Congress. (Stormy applause)

    Cuba is far from the Soviet Union, but the Cuban people watch the outstanding achievements of the creative labor of the great Soviet people with deep concern and heartfelt admiration. During the dark days experienced by Cuba, the three Soviet satellites brought joy and hope to our people. Now we hail with even greater pleasure the symbol of the absolute superiority achieved by Soviet science - the launch of the cosmic rocket, because while achieving this new major victory in overcoming the dark forces of imperialism, the Cuban people have also won a major victory over the imperialist oppressors.

    The great victories won by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party of Soviet Union and its Leninist Central Committee are not only an encouragement to nations like Cuba that are fighting against imperialist oppression, but also a real assistance. This great victory is also a great contribution to the cause of peace and socialism.

    Comrades! After seven years of arduous struggle, the Cuban people overthrew the bloody ruling clique of Batista, a gang of criminals and thieves who seized power through a military coup on March 10, 1952, a coup orchestrated by the U.S. State Department.

    U.S. imperialists put the bloodthirsty dictator Batista in power in order to deprive the working people of the economic and social achievements they had won, to turn our country into a U.S. colony, and to tie it to the imperialist war chariot. Following the instructions of his imperialist masters, Batista established a bloody dictatorship. Waving the tattered fascist anti-communist banner, he declared the People's Socialist Party illegal, subjected it to brutal and frenzied persecution, and destroyed democratic organizations and people's groups. He turned the army, supervised by U.S. "advisors," into a team of butchers of the people.

    The suffering endured by our people during the years of tyranny is beyond description. It is impossible to count all the men who were imprisoned, tortured, or killed, all the women who were abused and raped, all the children who were abducted as hostages or killed because their parents were revolutionaries or simply opponents. It is impossible to recount all the abuses and tortures suffered by political prisoners in torture chambers and prisons, or the atrocities of Batista's air force. Batista's air force was supplied by U.S. monopoly capitalists specifically to bomb and strafe the peaceful residents of cities and rural areas occupied by insurgent patriots. Batista, this brutal man and criminal, sold out Cuba's national sovereignty and caused more than 20,000 people to be tortured and brutally murdered.

    It can be imagined how difficult the struggle waged by our party and all Cuban patriots was. However, inspired by the invincible doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, the Cuban communists never lost confidence in the people. In the struggle against tyranny and imperialism, the Cuban communists, no matter how great the obstacles, always found appropriate forms of activity to unite the revolutionary forces of the Cuban people from below. (Applause)

    The People's Socialist Party, together with the Socialist Youth organizations, engaged in extremely secret underground activities and were often persecuted. At the cost of the precious lives of many of their leaders and organizers, these organizations established close ties with the workers, peasants, student masses, and the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie. The People's Socialist Party fought to unite all opposition forces and resolutely supported any action by the masses against the dictatorship. The People's Socialist Party was preparing for the struggle even while underground.

    Our party's experience shows that even underground, under the most difficult conditions of secrecy, the party should and can successfully prepare for the struggle against tyranny. (Applause)

    Twenty-five months ago, the insurgent forces, under the command of Fidel Castro and other patriots and anti-imperialist fighters, began an armed struggle. Our party regarded assisting the insurgents as its primary duty, pointing out the correct direction for them and ensuring the support of the masses. Our party led the peasants in the struggle for land, which enhanced the party's prestige among the peasants.

    Our party actively participated in the uprising movement, because the uprising movement had the nature of guerrilla warfare, which had nothing in common with riotism and individual terrorism. The party called on the masses to support Fidel Castro with all their financial and material resources, and constantly exposed the government's brutal suppression of the guerrillas and the peaceful residents of the guerrilla zones. Communists participated in the armed struggle and behaved bravely. They stood at the forefront of the struggle, winning the love and respect of their comrades.

    As a result of the armed struggle, Batista's dictatorship was overthrown, and subsequently, the military commission through which the U.S. ruling clique attempted to save the old reactionary system from complete collapse was eliminated.

    It is written in the outline that has just been published by the National Committee of our party: "The tyranny was overthrown because the entire people opposed it. The people actively participated in the struggle in various aspects and using all possible means, such as armed struggle, strikes, general strikes, patriotic movements, the struggle of workers and peasants, propaganda and agitation, refusing to participate in fake elections, and fighting against the agents of tyranny in various organizations."

    Now, power is in the hands of the insurgent forces led by Fidel Castro and his "July 26th" organization. 90% of the members of this organization are peasants, agricultural workers, urban workers, and university students with various revolutionary tendencies. This is a new regime. The entire old state machine and military machine have been destroyed, leaving no power or organizational force representing the collapsed system. The re-established armed forces are completely under the control of the insurgents. The commanders in the army and the people in the leading positions in the government are either elected by the guerrillas or approved by them. The old army no longer exists.

    An interim government has been established on the advice of the leader of the movement, Fidel Castro. This government has received such strong support at home and abroad that even the Washington government has been forced to recognize its existence. Cuba has been freed from oppression, it has gained independence, and become an independent and autonomous country.

    Comrades! It is difficult to express to you how high the revolutionary enthusiasm of the Cuban masses is now, after they have stood up to defend their motherland and smashed the political rule of foreign imperialism.

    What do the events in Cuba demonstrate? Like the events in Venezuela, the events in Cuba refute the arguments of some people who try to prove that it is impossible for Latin American countries to fight victoriously because they are close to the United States. As long as the entire people rise up to carry out armed struggle and take the destiny of the country into their own hands, victory is guaranteed. (Applause)

    Little Cuba has defeated reactionary forces and imperialist forces. This victory was made possible by the new configuration of forces on the international stage, the growth of the socialist camp, and the victorious struggles of the oppressed people of Asia and Africa. (Applause)

    The people of Latin America are successfully fighting for political and economic independence, and Latin America is no longer a reserve force for North American imperialism.

    However, the imperialists still maintain their control over Cuba's economy. They are unwilling to bow to reality and continue their revolutionary offensive against Cuba. First, they took advantage of Cuba's rightful trial of a group of the main criminals of the Batista regime, and launched a frenzied anti-Fidel Castro movement in the press. The U.S. propaganda machine attempted to deceive public opinion, and wanted to use this to weaken the broad support of public opinion for our revolution and cover up the imperialist's aggressive ambitions towards Cuba.

    Second, the imperialists are threatening Cuba with economic boycotts and even armed intervention. They used these threats to pressure the most wavering groups in the new government, trying to force them to retreat and surrender. At the same time, they stirred up an anti-communist movement with the aim of splitting the people, isolating left-wing parties, regaining political control, and salvaging their economic privileges. Therefore, the main task of the People's Socialist Party is to defend the fruits of the revolution and further develop the revolution.

    Comrades! Please allow me to express my gratitude from this historic rostrum to the communist and workers' parties of all countries for their sympathetic support for the cause of the Cuban people. (Stormy applause) But you are all experienced people, and you can understand that the Cuban people's struggle is not over. After this first struggle, it has entered a new, more difficult and dangerous stage. We should make it very clear to everyone that we need greater support from world public opinion.

    Comrades, please allow me to wish you success in the work of this congress, and I express my firm belief that the magnificent seven-year plan will be successfully realized. (Stormy applause, all stand)

    古巴人民社会党主席
    阿吉雷在苏共代表大会上的讲话
    新华社莫斯科6日电  “真理报”刊载了古巴人民社会党全国委员会主席西维罗·阿吉雷同志在苏共第二十一次代表大会1月31日上午会议上的讲话。全文如下：
    亲爱的同志们！请允许我代表古巴人民社会党全国委员会和总书记布拉斯·罗加同志，代表推翻了巴蒂斯塔的血腥的独裁统治并给帝国主义以沉重打击的战斗中的古巴人民，向苏联共产党中央委员会和第二十一次代表大会致以热烈的兄弟般的敬意。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    古巴距苏联很远，但是古巴人民怀着深刻关切和衷心赞美的心情注视着伟大苏联人民的创造性劳动的卓越成就。在古巴经历的黑暗日子中，三个苏联卫星给我国人民带来了喜悦和希望。现在我们以更加愉快的心情欢呼苏联科学取得的绝对优势的象征——宇宙火箭的发射，因为在取得战胜帝国主义黑暗势力的这一新的重大胜利的同时，古巴人民也获得了对帝国主义压迫者的重大胜利。
    苏联人民在苏联共产党及其列宁主义的中央委员会领导下获得的伟大胜利，对于像古巴这样的正在反对帝国主义压迫的民族来说，不仅是一种鼓励，而且是真正的援助，这一伟大胜利也是对和平和社会主义事业的巨大贡献。
    同志们！古巴人民经过七年的艰苦斗争后推翻了被人唾弃的巴蒂斯塔血腥统治集团，这一伙罪犯和盗贼是在1952年3月10日通过军事政变夺得政权的，而这次政变是在美国国务院策划的。
    美帝国主义者让嗜血的独裁者巴蒂斯塔掌握政权，是为了剥夺劳动人民争取到的经济和社会成果，是为了把我国变成美国的殖民地，并把它拴在帝国主义的战车上。巴蒂斯塔执行他那帝国主义主子的指示，确立了血腥的独裁统治。他打着破烂不堪的法西斯反共旗帜，宣布人民社会党非法，对它进行野兽般的疯狂迫害，并摧毁了民主组织和人民团体。他把在美国“顾问团”监视下的军队变成了屠杀居民的队伍。
    我国人民在暴政年代里所遭受的苦难是一言难尽的。要想把所有被监禁、被折磨或被杀害的男人，把所有被虐杀和强奸的妇女，把所有因为他们的父母是革命者或只是反对派而被掠走作为人质或被杀害的儿童计算清楚也是不可能的。无法尽述政治犯在刑讯室和监狱里所遭到的摧残和拷打，无法尽述巴蒂斯塔空军的兽行。巴蒂斯塔空军是美国垄断资本家供给他专来轰炸和扫射起义的爱国者所占领的城市和农村的和平居民的。巴蒂斯塔这个残暴分子和罪犯出卖了古巴的国家主权，并使两万多人受尽折磨和惨遭杀害。
    可以想像到，我们的党和所有古巴爱国者进行的斗争曾经是多么艰难。但是，古巴的共产党人在战无不胜的马克思列宁主义学说的鼓舞下，从来都没有丧失过对人民的信心。在反对暴政和帝国主义的斗争中，古巴共产党人不管有多么大的障碍，总是找到了适当的活动形式来自下而上地团结古巴人民的革命力量。（掌声）
    人民社会党和社会主义青年组织一道从事极秘密的地下活动，并经常遭到迫害。这些组织以自己许多领导人和组织成员的宝贵生命为代价和工人、农民、学生群众和革命的小资产阶级建立了紧密的联系。人民社会党为团结所有的反对派力量而进行了斗争，并坚决支持群众反对独裁的任何行动。人民社会党在处于地下状态时就已为斗争进行了准备。
    我们党的经验表明，甚至在地下，处在秘密状态的最困难的条件下，党应当而且有可能胜利地进行反对暴政斗争的准备工作。（掌声）
    在二十五个月以前，起义部队在菲德尔·卡斯特罗和其他爱国者及反对帝国主义的战士们的指挥下，开始了武装斗争，我们党把援助起义者看作是自己的首要义务，给他们指出了正确的方向并保证了人民群众的支持。我们党曾领导农民进行了争取土地的斗争，这就提高了党在农民中的威望。
    我们党积极地参加了起义运动，因为起义运动具有游击斗争的性质，它同暴乱主义和个人恐怖主义毫无共同之处。党号召人民群众用一切财力物力支持菲德尔·卡斯特罗，并且不断揭露政府对游击队和游击区农民所进行的残暴镇压。共产党人参加了武装斗争，而且表现得很勇敢，他们站在斗争的最前列，博得了战友们的爱戴和尊敬。
    由于武装斗争的结果，巴蒂斯塔的独裁统治被推翻了，随后又消灭了美国统治集团企图借以挽救旧的反动制度免于完全崩溃的军事委员会。
    在我们党的全国委员会刚刚发表的提纲中写道：“暴政之所以被推翻是由于全体人民都反对它，人民在各个方面并利用一切可能的方式积极参加了斗争，例如，武装斗争、罢工、总罢工、爱国运动，工农群众的斗争，宣传和鼓动，拒绝参加假选举，在各种组织中和暴政的代理人进行斗争等”。
    现在，政权已掌握在以菲德尔·卡斯特罗和他的“7月26”组织所领导的起义力量的手中，这个组织90％的成员是农民、农业工人和城市工人、各种不同革命倾向的大学生。这是一个新的政权。整个旧的国家机器和军事机器被摧毁了，没有留下任何代表垮了台的制度的政权或组织力量。重新建立的武装力量完全处在起义者的控制之下，军队中的指挥员和政府领导岗位上的人都是游击队员们推选的或者由他们批准的。旧的军队再也不存在了。
    根据运动的领导者菲德尔·卡斯特罗的建议成立了临时政府。这个政府在国内外得到了如此有力的支持，甚至连华盛顿政府也被迫承认它的存在，古巴摆脱了压迫，它获得了独立，成为一个独立自主的国家。
    同志们！很难向你们表达挺身起来保卫自己的祖国并粉碎了外国帝国主义政治统治的古巴人民群众现在的革命热情是多么高涨。
    古巴的事件说明了什么呢？和委内瑞拉事件一样，古巴事件驳斥了某些人的论调，这些人企图证明，拉丁美洲国家由于靠近美国因而就不可能胜利地进行斗争。只要全国人民起来进行武装斗争，并把国家的命运掌握在自己手里，胜利就有了保障。（掌声）
    小小的古巴打败了反动势力和帝国主义势力。这一胜利之所以成为可能，是由于国际舞台上的新的力量配置，是由于社会主义阵营的壮大和亚非被压迫人民的胜利斗争。（掌声）
    拉丁美洲人民正在顺利地进行争取政治和经济独立的斗争，拉丁美洲已不再是北美帝国主义的后备力量了。
    但是帝国主义者仍然保持着对古巴经济的统治，他们不愿意向现实低头，而继续向古巴的革命进攻。第一，他们利用古巴正当地审讯一群巴蒂斯塔制度的主要罪犯的机会，在报刊上发动了反对菲德尔·卡斯特罗的疯狂运动。美国宣传机关妄图欺骗社会舆论，并想以此来削弱舆论对我们革命的广泛支持和掩盖帝国主义对古巴的侵略野心。
    第二，帝国主义者拿经济抵制，甚至武装干涉来威胁古巴。他们以这种威胁向新政府中最不坚定的集团施加压力，竭力想迫使他们退却并投降。同时，他们掀起了反共运动，目的是要分裂人民，孤立左翼党派，重新攫取政治统治和挽救其经济上的特权。因此，人民社会党的主要任务就是捍卫革命果实并进一步发展革命。
    同志们！请允许我在这一具有历史意义的讲坛上向世界各国共产党和工人党对古巴人民的事业的同情支持表示感谢。（暴风雨般的掌声）但是，你们都是具有丰富经验的人，你们能够了解到，古巴人民的斗争并没有结束，在这第一次斗争以后，它进入了一个新的更加困难和危险的阶段。我们应该向大家非常明确地说明，我们需要全世界舆论更大的支持。
    同志们，请允许我祝你们在这次代表大会的工作中取得成就，我并表示坚信，宏伟的七年计划定能胜利地实现。（暴风雨般的掌声，全体起立）（附图片）
