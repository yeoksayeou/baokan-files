     Don't Forget Production During the Spring Festival
    The Spring Festival has arrived.
    Various places have made various arrangements to celebrate the Spring Festival: some are rehearsing theatrical programs, and some are preparing to launch sports competitions, which is really lively. These beneficial activities will make our Spring Festival rich and colorful.
    The people's communes in Daishi District, Fushun County, Sichuan Province, while arranging for commune members to have a good Spring Festival, put forward the slogan "Don't forget production during the festival," and used the time before the festival to mobilize the masses for discussion, and made proper and specific arrangements for agricultural work after the Spring Festival, so as to immediately invest in production after the festival. This is very meaningful.
    Now, "Start of Spring" has passed, and "Rain Water" is coming soon. The season waits for no one, and we must not miss the farming season because of the festival. Therefore, we must turn the Spring Festival into a rest before a greater production battle, and after enjoying ourselves, we will meet the spring ploughing with greater energy.

     过春节不忘生产
    春节来到了。
    各地为欢度春节作了种种安排：有的排演剧目，有的准备展开体育比赛，真是热热闹闹。这些有益的活动，将使我们春节过得丰富多采。
    四川富顺县代寺区各人民公社在安排社员过好春节的同时，提出了“过节不忘生产”的口号，并且利用节前时间，发动群众讨论，把春节后的农活作了妥善而具体的安排，以便在节日一过立即投入生产。这样作是很有意义的。
    现在，“立春”已过，“雨水”即将到来。季节是不等人的，我们千万不能因为过节误了农时。因此，我们要把春节变成更大生产战斗前的休整，在尽情欢乐之后，以更足劲头迎接春耕。
