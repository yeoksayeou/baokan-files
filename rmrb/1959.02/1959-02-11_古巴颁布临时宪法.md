Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 10th: The President of the Cuban Provisional Government, Urrutia, promulgated a new provisional constitution on the 8th. This provisional constitution will be implemented until the general election is held and the National Assembly is convened. When the Cuban Provisional Government was first established, Urrutia announced that general elections would be held within eighteen months.

It is reported that a spokesman for the Presidential Palace said that this provisional constitution reflects the principles of the Cuban Constitution of 1940, which was abolished by the dictator Batista after the coup in 1952.

The message said that the provisional constitution provides certain democratic freedoms and workers' rights, and allows the death penalty to be carried out in certain circumstances.

The provisional constitution changes the minimum age of the elected president from thirty-five to thirty years old.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 8th: The Cuban Provisional Government formally began the reorganization of the armed forces on the 7th. According to a series of decrees proposed by the Ministry of Defense and approved by the Council of Ministers, 1,066 Batista officers and soldiers were ordered to retire and be discharged. Among these people, two hundred were senior officers in the former dictatorial government's army.
