(Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 27th Dispatch) Over the past few weeks, the entire Chongqing Steel Company, from the Party Secretary to the workers, has been fully mobilized, focusing on attacking the high sulfur barrier in native iron, launching a vigorous technical revolution, and has achieved significant victories. The entire company has begun to see a new situation of a double leap in steel and steel product output and quality. In just six days from February 20th to 25th, steel production increased by 25.12% compared to the previous six days, and steel product output also increased by 17.2%. The quality of both steel and steel products has improved significantly.

In order to strive for a double leap in steel output and quality, the Chongqing Steel Company Party Committee launched a large-scale mobilization of all employees in early February around the theme of attacking sulfur, setting off a vigorous production competition. They set up a "one-stop" sulfur attack formation, starting simultaneously from all links in the production process. Leading cadres focused on key points, set targets, and competed to attack the high sulfur barrier. After veteran worker Liang Jinquan created a new record of 80.6% desulfurization in the pig iron furnace, Weng Wenlu quickly caught up, reaching 86.4% desulfurization. As soon as this record was announced, worker Huang Zhixiang took the lead with a new record of 86.5% desulfurization. The youth commando team of the third shift of the open hearth furnace workshop achieved a maximum desulfurization rate of 92.3% in the pig iron furnace.

Currently, the battle to attack sulfur by all employees of Chongqing Steel Company has entered a decisive stage. Recently, the company held a grand rally to pledge to win the decisive battle against sulfur, summarized the experience of the previous stage of fighting against high sulfur, commended advanced figures, and greatly promoted the mass technical revolution movement centered on attacking sulfur. All employees of the company are courageously advancing, striving for a complete victory in the battle against sulfur.

(Our Newspaper, Shanghai, 27th Dispatch) The employees of Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant are doing everything possible to produce good steel from bad materials, raising a high-quality red flag among converter steel plants in the country that use high-sulfur native iron. This plant, while using a large amount of native iron, has not only ensured the completion of the production plan but also greatly improved the quality of steel ingots, achieving a double leap in both output and quality. In January, the qualification rate of steel ingots reached 96.33%, and in the first twenty days of February, it leaped to 98.97%. On the 20th, they used all native iron with a sulfur content as high as 0.35%, and the qualification rate of steel ingots reached a record high of 99.87%, surpassing the level of using all good iron for steelmaking in the first half of last year. Due to the increase in the qualification rate of steel ingots, they produced 1,041 tons of steel more than planned in these fifty days, making it one of the best steel plants in Shanghai in completing the plan. In addition, by mid-January, they finally used 100% native iron to produce high-quality welding rod steel with a sulfur content below 0.03%, breaking the notion that native iron cannot be used to produce high-quality steel, and achieving good experience in native iron desulfurization.

    攻破高硫关  土铁出好钢
    重钢和上钢六厂产量质量双跃进
    本报重庆27日电　最近几周来，重庆钢铁公司从党委书记到职工全体总动员，以猛攻土铁高硫关为中心，大闹技术革命，已取得重大胜利。全公司开始出现钢和钢材产量、质量双跃进的新局面。仅据2月20日到25日的六天，钢产量又比前六天猛增25.12％，钢材产量也增加17.2％。钢和钢材的质量都有显著的提高。
    为了争取在钢的产量和质量上来一个双跃进，重庆钢铁公司党委在今年2月初即大张旗鼓地动员全体职工们围绕攻硫，掀起了轰轰烈烈的生产竞赛热潮。他们摆开“一条龙”的攻硫阵势。从生产过程中各个环节同时动手。领导干部针对关键，提出指标，你追我赶，猛攻高硫关。老工人梁金泉创造了在化铁炉脱硫80.6％的新纪录后，紧接着翁文禄又大步追赶，脱硫达到86.4％。这个纪录刚公布，工人黄治相又以脱硫86.5％的新纪录领先。大平炉车间三班青年突击队化铁炉脱硫最高曾达到92.3％。
    目前，重庆钢铁公司全体职工攻硫大战已进入决战阶段。最近公司进行了攻硫大决战的誓师大会，总结了前一阶段和高硫作斗争的经验，表扬了先进人物，把以攻硫为中心的群众性的技术革命运动大大推进了一步。全公司职工正纷纷奋勇前进，为取得攻硫大战全胜而斗争。
    本报上海27日电　上海第六钢铁厂职工千方百计向坏料要好钢，在全国利用高硫土铁炼钢的转炉中，举起了一面高质红旗。这个厂在大量采用土铁的情况下，既保证了产量计划的完成，又大大提高了钢锭的质量，产量质量双双跃进。1月份，钢锭合格率达到96.33％，2月头二十天又跃进到98.97％；20日这一天，他们全部用含硫高达0.35％的土铁，钢锭的合格率又创造了99.87％的最高纪录，超过了去年上半年全部用好铁炼钢的水平。由于钢锭的合格率的提高，这五十天内比计划多生产了一千零四十一吨钢，是上海炼钢厂中完成计划最出色的一个厂。此外，他们到1月中旬终于用100％的土铁炼成了含硫在0.03％以下优质电焊条钢，打破了土铁不能炼优质钢的观念，取得了土铁脱硫的良好经验。
