　　"Red light shines on Mount Leigong, the Miao and Dong homelands are like flowers"; this is a vivid picture of the beautiful homelands of all ethnic groups in the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, which are undergoing a comprehensive leap forward under the beacon of the general line of socialist construction.

　　The beautiful homelands of the Miao and Dong peoples lie beneath the verdant Miao Mountains and its main peak, Mount Leigong, and along the clear, green waters of the Qingshui River, the Duliu River, and the ?yang River. On this scenic land of 26,000 square kilometers, live more than 1.96 million people of various ethnic groups, mainly Miao and Dong. Here, there are more than 30,000 hectares of fertile land, more than 25 million mu of dense forests, and abundant underground mineral resources. The hardworking and brave Miao and Dong peoples have used their hands and wisdom to open up this vast area, develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, create a glorious history of revolutionary struggle, and a rich and colorful culture and art such as "Dong songs and Miao dances."

　　For thousands of years, the Miao and Dong peoples, living in the mountains and by the rivers, toiled diligently year after year, yet they suffered from the oppression and exploitation of successive rulers. They groaned and gasped on the brink of death, living a life of "firewood as cotton clothes, fern roots as grain, pine resin as lamplight, bare feet as shoes." Unable to endure the oppression and exploitation of the reactionary rulers, they launched numerous armed uprisings and heroic struggles to resist grain levies. Although these heroic armed struggles, which lasted for more than ten years, temporarily failed around 1872, the Miao and Dong peoples did not surrender. In November 1949, the hardworking and brave people of all ethnic groups in Southeast Guizhou were liberated under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Over the past nine years, through land reform, agricultural collectivization, the development of industrial and agricultural production, and other democratic reforms, socialist revolution, and socialist construction, the ideals of the revolutionary struggles of the Miao and Dong peoples have been realized. They sing with joy: "The iron tree blooms for a thousand years, the poor can now be masters, Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are truly good, the Miao, Dong, and Han are united like a family"; "Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are like the sun in winter and the rain in summer, without you, there would be no Miao and Dong family!"

　　1958 was a year of great leap forward for the people of all ethnic groups in Southeast Guizhou. In this year, after the ideological emancipation movement of the whole people's rectification and criticism of local nationalism, under the radiant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Miao and Dong peoples opposed conservatism, overcame fallacies such as the "backwardness theory," brought into play the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, united and assisted each other, and launched a great leap forward movement of "taking steel as the key link," simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and engaging in diversified operations of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, further implementing the Party's ethnic policies, and achieving unprecedented brilliant achievements.

　　In the great leap forward year, the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture grasped industry with one hand and agriculture with the other, resulting in a great development of comprehensive production in industry, agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. Southeast Guizhou, which had no industrial base, only had handicraft production in 1957, with output value accounting for about 9% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. In 1958, under the situation of the whole party and the whole people running industry, a large-scale steel "small indigenous groups" was launched, and steel production increased sharply to more than 3,000 tons; pig iron increased more than 23 times, producing more than 18,000 tons; raw coal increased 128 times; this made the industrial output value increase to account for about 45% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. In agricultural production, the "Eight-Character Charter" was implemented, and grain increased from 1.45 billion jin in 1957 to about 2.5 billion jin, an increase of 72%; the average yield per mu was about 1,000 jin, and each person had about 1,300 jin of grain. The dense forests were originally one of Southeast Guizhou's "mountain treasures." The local people "lived off the mountains," and the income from forestry accounted for a large proportion. The income from timber in Jinping County accounted for about 50% of the total income. In 1958, tens of thousands of people of all ethnic groups worked hard for 60 days, carried out deep plowing and land preparation, close planting and transplanting, planting more than 8 million mu of seedlings, nurturing more than 7.5 million mu of young forests, and raising about 11,000 mu of seedlings, so that the coverage area of new and old forests reached more than 25 million mu, and the timber storage reached nearly 40 million cubic meters, of which more than 20 million cubic meters were available for felling. In 1958, more than 665,000 cubic meters of timber were felled to support the socialist construction of the motherland. Animal husbandry has also developed considerably, with sheep increasing by 33.1%; horses increasing by 49%; cattle increasing by 2.4%; the number of pigs raised reached about 1.06 million, and more than 18,000 pigs and more than 1,300 cattle were transferred to other provinces in 1958. The total industrial and agricultural output value of the entire autonomous prefecture increased by 87% compared with 1957. In September and October, the people of all ethnic groups launched the people's commune movement. They sang loudly: "Communism is heaven, the people's commune is the bridge, the unity of nationalities is great, and happiness will last forever"! More than 3,200 advanced cooperatives and more than 400,000 households of farmers of all ethnic groups formed 81 large communes.

　　While industry and agriculture were developed simultaneously, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries were comprehensively developed, a cultural revolution climax also appeared in 1958. The whole prefecture launched a universal movement to eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people; primary school education was basically universalized; a large number of secondary schools, spare-time political, cultural, and technical schools, health stations, and private hospitals were established. The movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene was widely carried out, changing the habit of drinking cold water and eating raw food, and basically eliminating the prevalence of malaria. The phenomenon of "yellow rice, people in bed" has been fundamentally eliminated. In particular, people consciously broke those superstitious ideas such as "dragon veins," "feng shui," and "taboo days" that were not conducive to production. The people of all ethnic groups have stood up, become the masters of culture, and control their own destiny.

　　In the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the people's commune movement, party committees at all levels, in accordance with the Party Central Committee's ethnic policies and the Provincial Party Committee's instructions, paid special attention to respecting the customs and habits of the Miao and Dong peoples while breaking down superstitions about ghosts and gods and reforming certain customs, and promoted and improved ethnic arts such as "Dong songs and Miao dances" and improved the ethnic costumes of various ethnic groups. On ethnic festivals such as the May Festival and the Double Ninth Festival, holidays were taken as usual, allowing people of all ethnic groups to compete in dragon boat races, climb mountains, and dance to the reed pipe during the festivals. In the public canteens of the people's communes, the dietary needs of the Miao and Dong peoples, such as eating chili peppers, sauerkraut, pickled fish, and pickled meat, were taken into account. The implementation of these ethnic policies of the Party further united the Miao and Dong peoples and brought into play their labor enthusiasm and production initiative.

　　Now, cadres at all levels in the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture are deeply studying the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao's great instructions; the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture are also studying the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning the People's Communes," and have great determination and confidence to rectify and consolidate the people's communes. The people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture will, on the basis of the brilliant achievements of 1958, bring into play greater enthusiasm, adhere to "walking on two legs," do a good job in field management, do a good job in industrial construction, and develop industrial and agricultural production in a greater, better, and more comprehensive manner, to build the flower-like Miao and Dong homelands more beautiful and magnificent.

    总路线的红光照耀着苗侗家乡

      “雷公山上放红光，苗侗家乡花一样”；这是黔东南苗族侗族自治州各族人民在社会主义建设总路线的灯塔照耀下，正在全面跃进中的美丽家乡的生动画面。
    苗、侗各族人民的美丽家乡，在重峦叠翠的苗岭山脉和它的主峰雷公山下，在清澈碧绿的清水江、都柳江、?阳江畔。在这山明水秀的两万六千平方公里土地上，居住着以苗族、侗族为主的十几个民族、一百九十六万多各族人民。在这里，有着三万多顷良田，有着二千五百多万亩茂密森林，也有着蕴藏丰富的地下矿产。勤劳勇敢的苗、侗各族人民，用自己的双手和智慧，开辟了这一广大地区，发展了农林渔牧各业生产，创造了光辉的革命斗争历史和丰富多采的“侗歌苗舞”等文化艺术。
    千百年来，居住在山间江边的苗、侗各族人民，终年辛勤劳动，他却受尽了历代统治者的重重压迫和剥削。他们呻吟喘息在死亡的边缘，过着“柴火当棉袄，蕨根当粮草，松胶当灯照，赤脚当鞋跑”的日子。他们不堪忍受反动统治者的压迫和剥削，曾先后掀起了多次的武装起义和抗拒粮款的英勇斗争。这延续十多年的英勇的武装斗争虽则在1872年前后暂时失败了，但苗、侗各族人民并未屈服。1949年11月，黔东南勤劳勇敢的各族人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下得到了解放。九年多来，经过土地改革、农业合作化、发展工农业生产等民主改革、社会主义革命和社会主义建设，苗、侗各族人民革命斗争的理想实现了。他们欢欣鼓舞地唱着：“千年铁树开鲜花，穷人如今得当家，毛主席共产党呵真正好，苗侗汉族团结得像一家”；“毛主席共产党好像冬天太阳夏天的雨，没有您呵，就没有苗侗家”！
    1958年是黔东南各族人民大跃进的一年。在这一年里，经过全民整风和批判了地方民族主义的思想大解放运动之后，苗、侗各族人民在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，反对了保守主义，克服了“落后论”等谬论，发挥了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，团结互助、干劲冲天地掀起了“以钢为纲”、工农业同时并举、农林牧副渔多种经营的大跃进运动，进一步贯彻了党的民族政策，取得了史无前例的光辉成就。
    黔东南苗族侗族自治州，在大跃进的一年中，一手抓工业，一手抓农业，从而出现了工、农、林、牧等全面生产的大发展。向来没有工业基础的黔东南地区，1957年只有手工业生产，产值占工农业总产值9％左右。1958年，在全党全民办工业的形势下，大搞钢铁“小土群”，钢产量猛增到三千多吨；生铁猛增二十三倍多，生产了一万八千多吨；原煤增长一百二十八倍；这就使工业产值增长到占工农业总产值的45％左右。农业生产，执行了“八字宪法”，粮食由1957年的十四亿五千万斤上升到二十五亿斤左右，增长了72％；亩产平均千斤左右，每人有粮一千三百斤左右。茂密的森林原是黔东南的“山宝”之一。当地人民“靠山吃山”，林业收入比重很大，锦屏县林木收入即占总收入的50％左右。1958年几万各族人民苦战六十天，大闹深翻整地，密植移栽，栽下幼苗八百多万亩，抚育幼林七百五十多万亩，育苗一万一千亩左右，使新老森林复盖面积达到了二千五百多万亩，木材蓄积量达到了近四千万立方公尺，可伐量已有两千多万立方公尺。1958年就伐木六十六万五千多立方公尺，支援了祖国的社会主义建设。畜牧业也有相当大的发展，羊增殖33.1％；马增殖49％；耕牛增殖2.4％；生猪喂养头数达到一百零六万左右，1958年调运给外省的生猪达一万八千多头，耕牛一千三百多头。全自治州工农业总产值比1957年增长了87％。9、10月间，各族人民曾掀起了人民公社化运动。他们高唱：“共产主义是天堂，人民公社是桥梁，民族团结力量大，幸福日子永无疆”！三千二百多个高级社、四十多万户各族农民，组成了八十一个大公社。
    在工农业同时并举、农林牧副渔全面发展的同时，一个文化革命的高潮，也在1958年出现。全州开展了普遍的扫除青壮年文盲的运动；基本普及了小学教育；建立了大批中等学校、业余政治文化技术学校、保健站和民办医院。除四害讲卫生运动普遍开展，改变了喝冷水、吃生食的习惯，基本消除了疟疾流行。那种“稻谷黄，人病床”的现象已从根本上消除了。特别是人们自觉地破除了那些不利于生产的“龙脉”“风水”“忌日”等等迷信思想。各族人民已经站立起来，当了文化的主人，掌握着自己的命运了。
    在工农业生产大跃进和人民公社化运动中，各级党委根据党中央的民族政策和省委的指示，在破除迷信鬼神、改革某些习俗的同时，特别注意了尊重苗、侗各族人民的风俗习惯，并发扬和提高了“侗歌苗舞”等民族艺术和改进了各族的民族服装。在五月节、重阳节等民族节日，照例休假，让各族人民在节日竞赛龙舟，登高玩山，跳籚笙舞等。在人民公社的公共食堂中，照顾到苗、侗各族人民吃辣子、酸菜、腌鱼、腌肉等生活需要。这些党的民族政策的贯彻，进一步团结了苗、侗各族人民，发挥了他们的劳动热情和生产积极性。
  现在，黔东南苗族侗族自治州的各级干部，正在深入学习党的八届六中全会的决议和毛主席的伟大指示；全州各族人民也在学习“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，具有很大的决心和信心整顿和巩固人民公社。全州苗、侗各族人民要在1958年光辉成就的基础上，发挥更大的干劲，坚持“两条腿走路”，搞好田间管理，搞好工业建设，以更大更好更全面地发展工农业生产，把鲜花般的苗、侗家乡建设得更加美丽绚烂。
