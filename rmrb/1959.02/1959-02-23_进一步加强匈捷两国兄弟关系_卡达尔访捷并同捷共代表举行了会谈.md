Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 21st: A communique regarding the visit of János Kádár, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, to Czechoslovakia was released here tonight.

The communique stated that during his visit to Czechoslovakia, Kádár held talks with representatives of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. The representatives of the two parties discussed the experiences gained in the socialist construction of Hungary and Czechoslovakia, and exchanged views on the current international political situation and some issues in the international workers' revolutionary movement.

Both sides highly appraised the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The communique said that the achievements of this congress were also a significant contribution to the further enormous development of the economic, political, and cultural life of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and the entire world socialist system. The achievements of the congress also opened up new prospects for the international workers' revolutionary movement, and illuminated the path for the further victory of the forces of peace and progress in the world.

The communique noted with satisfaction that the relationship between the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Czechoslovak Communist Party, as well as the friendly cooperation between the two countries, is developing smoothly in the spirit of proletarian internationalism and the common realization of the lofty ideals of Marxism-Leninism.

The communique stated that the two parties will continue to wage a firm and uncompromising struggle against the conspiracies of international imperialist reactionaries that threaten peace and hinder world progress, against all manifestations of bourgeois nationalism, and against the divisive conspiracies of revisionists.

The communique finally emphasized that Kádár's visit to Czechoslovakia contributed to the further strengthening of the fraternal relations between the peoples of Hungary and Czechoslovakia.

Comprehensive report from this newspaper, via Xinhua News Agency: At the invitation of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government of Czechoslovakia, János Kádár, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers's Party, paid a friendly visit to Czechoslovakia from February 18th to 21st.

Kádár arrived in Prague on the 18th. He was welcomed at the station by Antonín Novotný, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and President of the Republic, and Jiří Hendrych, member of the Politburo and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party.

On the morning of February 19th, Antonín Novotný, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and President of the Republic, received János Kádár, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, and his wife at Prague Castle and had a long conversation with them.

While visiting the Jan Šverma Machine Factory in Prague on the 19th, Kádár said that the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan and the 21st Congress of the CPSU dealt a blow to all reactionaries from which they will never recover.

Kádár added, "We believe that if we are to represent the interests of our people well, we must follow the path taken by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people before us—the path of communism and peace."

Kádár said that we look to the future with confidence, and we can be sure that we will also be able to build a socialist society in Hungary.

Kádár also said: Our strength lies in the theory of Marxism-Leninism, which guides our party and, through it, guides the Hungarian people; our strength also lies in our belief in proletarian internationalism.

Referring to the Yugoslav revisionists who are being exploited by imperialism, Kádár emphasized: "We cannot tell the Yugoslav revisionists what they should and should not do. However, we can tell them that they should keep their theories to themselves." He continued: "We are not fools, we know what revisionism is and what Marxism-Leninism is."

Kádár and his entourage left Prague by train on the 21st and returned to Budapest that evening.

Those who saw him off at the station included: Antonín Novotný, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and President of the Republic, and Foreign Minister David, among others.
