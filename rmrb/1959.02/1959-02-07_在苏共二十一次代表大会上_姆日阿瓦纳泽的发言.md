(Xinhua News Agency, February 5th) According to TASS: Mzhavanadze, Alternate Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, delivered a speech at the 21st Congress of the CPSU on the morning of January 29th.

He emphasized that Khrushchev's report proposal reveals the grand plan for various new tasks to all Soviet people and all progressive mankind, and makes people firmly believe that communism is not a distant future, but our tomorrow.

Mzhavanadze said that the Georgian Party organization, a detachment of the multi-million-member Communist Party of the Soviet Union, is participating in the 21st Congress as a party as solid as a rock and closely united around the Leninist Central Committee. At the party representative conferences in various districts, cities, and states, and at the 19th Extraordinary Congress of the Communist Party of Georgia, the Georgian Communists demonstrated their unity and their firm determination to fulfill and over fulfill the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan. The working people of Georgia deeply understand that our republic has made great achievements in developing its economy and culture and in improving the material welfare of the working people, thanks to the brotherly assistance and close cooperation of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union. Socialist Georgia has surpassed its neighboring capitalist countries in industry, agriculture, culture, and science. Georgia now trains more specialists every year than the total number of specialists trained by several neighboring countries every year, even though these countries have several times more population than Georgia.

The control figures for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union from 1959 to 1965 are a concrete manifestation of the Leninist national policy. It reflects the Communist Party's great concern for the further development of the economy and culture of all fraternal nationalities in the Soviet Union. The Seven-Year Plan has a profound scientific basis. It is entirely correct to use all funds and material resources for measures that first and foremost guarantee the interests of the whole country and the whole Soviet Union, and at the same time undoubtedly promote the economic development of the various allied republics and regions of our country.

Mzhavanadze continued by saying that, based on the characteristics of our republic, starting from its natural resources and natural conditions, a huge program for the development of industry, agriculture, culture, and science in the Georgian Republic has been formulated. The republic's ferrous metallurgy industry, non-ferrous metallurgy industry, and fuel industry will be further developed. Special attention is being paid to the chemical industry. In 1965, the output of the electrical machinery industry will increase sevenfold.

Mzhavanadze said that the Seven-Year Plan stipulates that the various sectors of the republic's agriculture will grow by at least half to one-fold. We will first develop the production of tea, wine, and fruit. The completion of the planned task of increasing tea production will make it possible for us to fully guarantee our country's needs with our own tea.

Further development of animal husbandry is particularly important. The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that the production of animal products will increase by one to one and a half times. The working people of Georgia have already enthusiastically started to implement this task. There is no doubt that this task can not only be completed but also over fulfilled. We plan to double the meat production of collective farms and state farms in 1959, following the example of advanced states and republics.

Mzhavanadze continued, "Man makes the matter." We have thousands of outstanding people – production innovators and advanced agricultural workers. They have shown the heights that can be reached with persevering labor and a high degree of social consciousness. The experience of these people makes everyone firmly believe that the huge program we have formulated is realistic.

The speaker pointed out that the realization of the grand tasks of the Seven-Year Plan will demonstrate with new strength the enormous superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, and the realization of the Seven-Year Plan will make a big step forward for our country on the road to solving its basic economic tasks. This grand task is to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product output.

It is the sacred duty of every allied republic, every frontier region, and every state to make its own contribution to this great historical cause.

Mzhavanadze said that, representing the Communist Party of Georgia, which has 220,000 members, and representing all the working people of the republic, our delegation assures the 21st Congress of the CPSU that the Georgian Party organization will unite the masses and strive for the successful completion of this great task of building communism.

    在苏共二十一次代表大会上
    姆日阿瓦纳泽的发言
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联共产党中央委员会主席团候补委员姆日阿瓦纳泽1月29日上午在苏共第二十一次代表大会上发了言。
    他强调说，赫鲁晓夫的报告提纲在全体苏联人民、全体进步人类面前揭示了各项新工作的宏伟计划，使人们深信，共产主义不是遥远的未来，而是我们的明天。
    姆日阿瓦纳泽说，拥有几百万人的苏联共产党一个支队——格鲁吉亚党组织是作为一个坚如磐石的、紧密团结在列宁主义的中央委员会周围的党来参加第二十一次代表大会的。格鲁吉亚共产党人在各个区、市、州的党代表会议上，在格鲁吉亚共产党第十九次非常代表大会上都显示了自己的团结，显示了要完成和超额完成七年计划各项任务的坚定决心。格鲁吉亚劳动人民深刻地理解到，我们的共和国，由于苏联各族人民的兄弟帮助和紧密合作在发展经济和文化方面，在提高劳动人民的物质福利方面，都取得了很大的成就。社会主义的格鲁吉亚在工农业和文化科学方面超过了同它邻近的资本主义国家。格鲁吉亚现在每年培养出来的专门人才要比几个邻国每年培养的专门人才总数还要多得多，虽然这些国家的人口要比格鲁吉亚多好几倍。
    1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济控制数字是列宁主义民族政策的具体表现。它反映了共产党对苏联各兄弟民族经济和文化进一步发展的伟大关怀。七年计划有着深刻的科学基础。把一切资金和物质资源都用在那些首先保证全国、全苏联利益、同时无疑也促进各加盟共和国和我国各地区的经济发展的措施中，这种作法是完全正确的。
    姆日阿瓦纳泽接着说，根据我们共和国的特点，从它的自然资源和自然条件出发，制订了格鲁吉亚共和国工农业和文化科学方面发展的巨大纲领。我们共和国的黑色冶金工业、有色冶金工业、燃料工业将有进一步的发展。化学工业正受到特别的注意。1965年电机工业产品将增加七倍。
    姆日阿瓦纳泽说，七年计划规定共和国农业各部门至少将增长半倍到一倍。我们将首先发展茶叶、酒类、水果的生产。增加茶叶生产的预定任务的完成，将使我们有可能用自己的茶叶来充分保证我国的需要。
    进一步发展畜牧业是特别重要的。七年计划规定畜产品的生产将增加一到一点五倍。格鲁吉亚的劳动人民已经热火朝天地着手实现这个任务。毫无疑问，这个任务不仅可以完成，而且可以超额完成。我们打算在1959年仿效先进州和共和国的榜样，把集体农庄和国营农场的肉类产量提高一倍。
    姆日阿瓦纳泽接着说，事在人为。我们具有成千上万卓越的人们——生产革新者、农业先进工作者。他们已经表明，以坚毅不拔的精神进行劳动和高度的社会觉悟将会达到怎样的高峰。这些人的经验使大家坚信，我们所制订的巨大的纲领是现实的。
    发言人指出，七年计划宏伟任务的实现将以新的力量显示出社会主义制度对资本主义制度的巨大的优越性，七年计划的实现将使我国在解决自己的基本经济任务的道路上迈出一大步。这个宏伟的任务就是，在按人口平均计算的产品产量方面，赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    每个加盟共和国、每个边疆区和州的神圣义务就是对这个伟大的历史事业作出自己的贡献。
    姆日阿瓦纳泽说，代表拥有二十二万党员的格鲁吉亚共产党，代表共和国全体劳动人民，我们代表团向苏共第二十一次代表大会保证，格鲁吉亚的党组织将团结群众，争取顺利完成这个建设共产主义的伟大任务。
