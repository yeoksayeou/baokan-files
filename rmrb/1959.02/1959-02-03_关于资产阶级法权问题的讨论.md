    Editor's Note: Since the publication of Comrade Hou Mingfang's article "Remnants of Bourgeois Right Are Not Bourgeois Right" on January 3, we have received more than 200 articles discussing this issue as of January 27. The arguments in these articles can be summarized into the following six aspects:
    (1) Disagreeing with Comrade Hou Mingfang's argument that denies the partial and whole relationship between the remnants of bourgeois right and bourgeois right, affirming that the two are in a partial and whole relationship. From this point of view, there are two different opinions: One opinion believes that there is no difference in nature between the two, and both are the embodiment of the will of the bourgeoisie; the other opinion believes that there is a difference in nature between the two, the former being used by the proletariat to serve socialist construction, and the latter being used to serve the rule of the bourgeoisie.
      (2) The scope of the remnants of bourgeois right is very broad, including not only some old rules and regulations, but also ideology and style (what people usually call bourgeois right ideology). Therefore, it is obviously wrong for Comrade Hou Mingfang to lump the remnants of bourgeois right together as the embodiment of the will of the proletariat and the superstructure of socialism, because bourgeois right ideology can never be the embodiment of the will of the proletariat.
      (3) Bourgeois right and the remnants of bourgeois right are a relationship of whole and remainder, and the so-called "remnants" refer to inequalities that are formally the same as bourgeois right but different in essence. The inequality of bourgeois right is a contradiction between the enemy and ourselves, while the inequality of the remnants of bourgeois right is a contradiction among the people. The two have essential differences, but also non-essential connections; they are neither isolated nor equal. Therefore, we disagree with Comrade Hou Mingfang's statement that the remnants of bourgeois right are the proletariat's right.
      (4) In the socialist stage, due to the limitations of economic and political conditions, the remnants of bourgeois right retained in proletarian right are consciously used by the proletariat to serve socialism. These kinds of remnants of bourgeois right are no longer bourgeois right, but proletarian right. Therefore, we basically agree with the views of Comrade Hou Mingfang's article, but we feel that Comrade Hou Mingfang's article is not precise enough and clear enough in some places, and it is easy to cause misunderstandings.
      (5) Believing that the nature of distribution according to work is basically the embodiment of the will of the proletariat and proletarian right, only from the point of view of "equal exchange" is the remnant of bourgeois right retained. Therefore, we disagree with Comrade Hou Mingfang's view that distribution according to work is a remnant of bourgeois right.
      (6) There are also two opinions on the policies of the bourgeoisie's redemption of "four horses divided profit" and fixed interest. One opinion believes that these are only the proletariat's methods of transforming the bourgeoisie, so they disagree with Comrade Hou Mingfang's inclusion of it in the view of proletarian right. One opinion believes that from the perspective of transforming the bourgeoisie, it can be said to be proletarian right; but from the perspective of retaining exploitation, it is a concession of the proletariat to the bourgeoisie.
    Now we will select and publish several articles with relatively clear arguments and relatively full discussions in succession, hoping that readers will continue to discuss this issue.

### 关于资产阶级法权问题的讨论

    关于资产阶级法权问题的讨论
    编者按：1月3日发表侯明方同志的“资产阶级法权残余不是资产阶级法权”一文以后，截至27日止，共收到有关讨论这个问题的文章二百多篇。这些文章的论点归纳起来有以下六个方面：
    （一）不同意侯明方同志否认资产阶级法权残余和资产阶级法权是部分和整体关系的论点，肯定两者是部分和整体的关系。从这一观点出发，又有两种不同的意见：一种意见认为，两者并没有性质上的不同，都是资产阶级意志的体现；一种意见认为，两者有性质上的区别，前者是无产阶级利用来为社会主义建设服务的，后者则是为资产阶级的统治服务的。
      （二）资产阶级法权残余包括的范围很广，不但包括一些旧的规章制度，而且包括思想意识和作风（人们通常称为资产阶级法权思想）。因此，侯明方同志把资产阶级法权残余笼统地说成是无产阶级意志的体现，是社会主义的上层建筑，显然是错误的，因为资产阶级法权思想任何时候都不能成为无产阶级意志的体现。
      （三）资产阶级法权与资产阶级法权残余是整体和残余的关系，而所谓“残余”又指的是形式上与资产阶级法权相同而本质上不同的不平等。资产阶级法权的不平等是敌我矛盾，资产阶级法权残余的不平等则是人民内部矛盾。两者有本质的区别，但又有非本质的联系；既不是绝缘，又不是相等。因此，不同意侯明方同志把资产阶级法权残余说成是无产阶级的法权。
      （四）在社会主义阶段，由于经济政治条件的限制，在无产阶级法权中保留的资产阶级法权残余，是无产阶级自觉地利用来为社会主义服务的，这类资产阶级法权残余已经不是资产阶级法权，而是无产阶级法权。因此，基本上同意侯明方文章的观点，但觉得侯明方的文章在某些地方说得不够确切，不够清楚，容易使人产生误解。
      （五）认为按劳分配的性质基本上是无产阶级意志的体现，是无产阶级法权，只就“等价交换”这一点说，才保留了资产阶级法权残余。因此，不同意侯明方同志把按劳分配说成是资产阶级法权残余的观点。
      （六）对资产阶级赎买的四马分肥、定息等政策，也有两种意见，一种意见认为这些只是无产阶级改造资产阶级的办法，因此不同意侯明方同志把它归入无产阶级法权的观点。一种意见认为就改造资产阶级这一方面来看，可以说是无产阶级法权；但就保留剥削来看，又是无产阶级对资产阶级的一种让步。
    现在我们选择几篇论点比较鲜明、论述也比较充分的文章陆续发表，希望读者对这一问题继续进行讨论。
