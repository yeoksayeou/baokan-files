　　Indigenous Methods, Strengthened Procurement, Finding Substitutes
　　Gansu Actively "Secures Grain" for Light Industry

　　This newspaper's Lanzhou dispatch on the 23rd: Gansu Province has dispatched several groups of people, adopting methods such as manufacturing industrial raw materials using indigenous methods, collecting waste products, finding substitutes, utilizing wild plants and animals, and strengthening the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, to actively "secure grain" for light industry products. With more raw materials available, the production of light industrial products throughout the province is rapidly increasing. It is estimated that the output of soap in February can be more than double that of January; sugar will increase by more than one-fold, while paper, enamelware, and cigarettes can increase by about half; other items such as thermos bottles, oils and fats, yarn, and knitwear will also have varying degrees of increase.

　　The foundation of Gansu Province's raw material industry is relatively weak. In the past, the production of light industrial products, which were few in quantity and variety, also relied on the supply of some raw materials from other provinces. This year, the increase in the production of light industrial products encountered difficulties in the supply of certain raw materials. The Party committees at all levels throughout the province regarded overcoming these difficulties as a driving force for promoting the development of the raw material industry, and decided to utilize the province's abundant resources to vigorously develop small and medium-sized, indigenously produced raw material industries, striving to achieve self-reliance in manufacturing various light industrial raw materials in the short term. Dozens of raw material factories that are already in production and under construction include rosin, baked glue, caustic soda, pulp, sulfuric acid, wool grease, bleaching powder, baking soda, and others. In addition to being used to increase the production of some light industrial products, the raw materials produced by these factories can also be used to produce new products that Gansu did not produce in the past, such as batteries, toothpaste, and soap.

　　Turning the useless into the useful is another way to open up sources of raw materials. Taking advantage of the opportunity of vigorously carrying out the sanitation campaign, various localities mobilized every household to collect waste materials, which were sorted and processed by relevant units for use as raw materials. Factories that manufacture thermos bottles and glassware use the alkali content in broken glass to replace part of the soda ash. The Lanzhou Cultural Paper Mill actively uses waste paper to make paper. After being sorted and initially processed by waste processing plants, garbage is also turned into dozens of industrial raw materials.

　　Various mountainous areas organized the masses to hunt wild boars, bears, marmots, wild rabbits, and other harmful animals, using animal oil to make soap, animal skins to make leather, and animal bones to boil bone glue and bone oil.

　　The vast number of workers in the light industrial system have also tried every means to find substitute raw materials. Acidic clay is produced near Lanzhou, and the Lanzhou Soap Factory has begun to use acidic clay to make soap. Many places in Gansu produce alkali soil, and the glass industry uses alkali soil to replace part of the soda ash.

　　Commercial departments across the province have transferred half of their manpower to launch a concentrated effort to purchase agricultural and sideline products to support light industry. Some simple processing plants newly built by commercial departments in the producing areas pre-process agricultural and sideline products to reduce their volume and weight. In this way, transportation difficulties can be reduced when they are transported to urban factories. (Guo Fenxiang)

### 土法制造　加强收购　找代用品  甘肃积极为轻工业“筹粮”

    土法制造　加强收购　找代用品
    甘肃积极为轻工业“筹粮”
    本报兰州23日电　甘肃省出动几路人马，采取土法制造工业原料、收集废品、寻找代用品、利用野生动植物、加强收购农副产品等办法，为轻工业品积极“筹粮”。由于有了更多的原料，全省轻工业品的生产正在迅速增长。预计2月份的肥皂产量，可以比元月份增加二倍多；糖增加一倍多，纸、搪瓷、卷烟可增加半倍左右；其他如热水瓶、油脂、纱、针织品等，也将有不同程度的增长。
    甘肃省原料工业的基础比较薄弱，过去生产数量不多、品种较少的轻工业品，也要依靠外省供给一部分原料。今年轻工业品要增产，就碰到了某些原料供应不足的困难。全省各级党委把克服这些困难当作推动原料工业发展的动力，决定利用本地丰富的资源，大搞中小型的、土法生产的原料工业，争取在短期内自力更生制造各种轻工业原料。现在已经投入生产和正在筹建的原料工厂，有松香、烤胶、烧碱、纸浆、硫酸、羊毛脂、漂白粉、小苏打等数十种。这些工厂生产的原料除用来增产一些轻工业品外，还可用来生产电池、牙膏、香皂等过去甘肃不生产的新产品。
    化无用为有用，是另一种开辟原料来源的办法。各地趁着大搞卫生运动的机会，发动家家户户收集废料，经过有关单位分类整理以后用作原料。制造热水瓶和玻璃器皿的工厂就利用碎玻璃中所含的碱分来代替一部分纯碱。兰州文化造纸厂积极利用废旧纸张造纸。垃圾经过废物加工厂整理和初步加工，也变成几十种工业原料。
    山区各地组织群众捕打野猪、熊、旱獭、野兔等害兽，利用兽油做肥皂，用兽皮制革，兽骨熬骨胶、骨油。
    轻工业系统的广大职工还千方百计地寻找代用原料。兰州附近出产酸性白土，兰州肥皂厂已经开始利用酸性白土做肥皂。甘肃不少地方出产土碱，玻璃工业就用土碱代替一部分纯碱。
    全省各地商业部门抽调了一半人力，突击收购农副产品，支援轻工业。商业部门在产地新建的一些简易加工厂，把农副产品先进行一次初步加工，来压缩体积和重量。这样运往城市工厂时就可以减少运输上的困难。　　　　　　　　　　（郭汾祥）
