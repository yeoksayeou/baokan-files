    Spring Festival Outlook for a High Tide
    Abstract of the Editorial from "Frontline," Issue No. 3, 1959
    The high tide of the Great Leap Forward in 1959 has arrived.
    Facing the new high tide of the Great Leap Forward, our ideological and organizational work should also play its full role. We have repeatedly discussed several ideological understanding issues regarding the Great Leap Forward to prepare ideologically for striving for a greater leap forward in 1959. We believe that the Great Leap Forward is the basic pace of our socialist construction and an inevitable manifestation of the leap-forward development of our social productive forces. The most active factor in social productive forces is people, and the decisive factor in production relations is also people. Therefore, as long as we give full play to our subjective initiative within the possible scope of objective laws, arrange the production of various departments according to a certain proportion, combine soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis, formulate practical and specific plans, and take a series of political, organizational, and technical measures, we will definitely be able to make great achievements in the Great Leap Forward. These ideological understandings are basically consistent among the majority of our cadres; and in the process of discussing and formulating plans, everyone has put forward both reliable and active production targets and various measures in the spirit of the Great Leap Forward, which provides a strong guarantee for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959.
    The current problem lies in how to mobilize all positive factors, do everything possible to implement all measures one by one, and come up with more methods to strive for the realization of new leap-forward targets. At this time, summarizing and promoting good working methods and good experiences is of great significance. Among the 100 industrial and mining enterprises in the city that completed their monthly plans ahead of schedule in January, we should first summarize some good experiences.
    What are some outstanding good experiences? Here, the first important experience we should acknowledge is that all subjective and objective conditions are changeable. This is a proposition with universal significance. For example, the experience of the Liulihe Cement Plant shows that the same insufficient raw materials, the same existing machinery and equipment, and the same insufficient labor force, which were considered difficult conditions in the past, are no longer difficult conditions now. That is to say, difficult conditions have become non-difficult conditions. Why did this change occur? This is because they deeply mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, tried every possible means to overcome difficulties, prepared early, grasped inspections, and rationally allocated manpower, materials, and time. Their continued adherence to and implementation of the Party's mass line and the large-scale mass movement are the key to their ability to show new Great Leap Forward achievements at the beginning of the new year. This experience has no mystery when explained, but it seems magically wonderful when people do not know how to do it or are unwilling to do it. Now we must promote this experience everywhere so that everyone understands this principle.
    Does this mean that we can completely disregard any actual conditions and do whatever we want? Of course not. For anything to be successful, there must be certain objective and subjective conditions. However, we must never regard these conditions as absolute and mysterious, and we should not fall into the quagmire of "conditionalism," nor should we regard any conditions as unchangeable. We must see that objective conditions often have many advantages and some disadvantages. Favorable conditions often have the potential to overcome unfavorable conditions. Subjective conditions also often have unfavorable and favorable aspects, and they themselves are full of variability, that is to say, full of the potential to overcome unfavorable conditions. At the same time, objective and subjective conditions often influence each other, causing a series of new changes.
    People who are immersed in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward should analyze subjective and objective conditions from the perspective of materialist dialectics, from the process of development and change, and from a dynamic point of view, rather than from a static state, and should not analyze them from a metaphysical point of view. As long as we correctly analyze various conditions, are good at taking the initiative, and promote the development of subjective and objective conditions in a direction more favorable to us, our socialist construction will surely have a greater leap forward.
    When we completed the industrial production plan ahead of schedule in January of this year, we must not become arrogant and complacent. Everyone must work harder to further strive to complete the production plan for the first quarter ahead of schedule. It is now the Spring Festival season, and we look forward to this beautiful spring bringing us a continuous high tide of leap forward. Remember, "not to advance is to retreat," which is the most common truth that the ancients have already discovered. In the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, we must especially adhere to continuous leap forward. If we are satisfied with the achievements we have already made and stop or slow down, then we will be far behind when others continue to move forward by leaps and bounds. Of course, every ambitious person cannot be willing to fall behind, we must always compare ourselves with the advanced and catch up with the advanced!
    "What others can do, we should also be able to do." This sentence makes sense. If we do not understand this issue one-sidedly but analyze it comprehensively, then we should admit that under basically the same conditions, the same production or the same work should be able to produce the same results. If the conditions are basically the same but the results are very different, then we can only say that this is caused by the wide disparity in the degree of subjective effort. Because subjective initiative can undoubtedly promote changes in objective conditions to a certain extent. To insist that one's own conditions are not as good as others, and to insist that one cannot do what others can do, such people do not exist now, and hopefully will not appear again in the future.
    In the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, we will see more heroic and model figures emerge on all fronts. Everyone should compare their enthusiasm and dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. These are the qualities and styles that socialist builders should have. This kind of quality and style has nothing in common with the style of exaggeration. The former style is the characteristic of scientific Marxists, while the latter style is the remnant of the bureaucratic and political style left over from the old society. What we want to strive to promote is the former good style, and what we want to resolutely oppose is the latter bad style.
    We are builders of socialism, we are scientific Marxists, our cause is a great cause unprecedented in history, we are constantly striving for this great cause, and everyone must become a revolutionary hero who stands upright between heaven and earth. This is not an exaggeration at all, but our due ambition. We must have soaring enthusiasm and be down-to-earth. Isn't this standing upright between heaven and earth? We must continuously make revolution and do things that our predecessors dared not imagine. What else is this if not a revolutionary hero? "To count the outstanding figures, we must look to the present." May our heroic figures come with the Spring Festival, and may everyone of us make great contributions in this year's high tide of the Great Leap Forward.

    新春望高潮
    “前线”一九五九年第三期社论摘要
    1959年大跃进的高潮来到了。
    面临着新的大跃进高潮，我们的思想工作和组织工作同样应该充分地发挥作用。我们曾经反复地讨论了关于大跃进的若干思想认识问题，为争取实现1959年的更大跃进做了思想准备。我们认为大跃进是我们建设社会主义的基本步伐，是我们的社会生产力飞跃式发展的一种必然表现。而在社会生产力中最积极的因素是人，在生产关系中具有决定意义的因素也是人，因此，我们只要在客观规律发生作用的可能范围内，充分发挥主观的能动作用，按照一定的比例来安排各部门的生产，把冲天的干劲和科学的分析结合起来，制订切实具体的计划，并且采取一系列政治措施、组织措施和技术措施，我们就一定能够在大跃进中做出巨大的成绩。这些思想认识在我们的大多数干部中基本上是一致的；并且在讨论和制订计划的过程中，大家都以大跃进的精神，提出了既可靠又积极的生产指标和各种措施，这就为1959年更大、更好、更全面的跃进提供了有力的保证。
    现在的问题是在于怎样调动一切积极因素，千方百计，把各种措施一一兑现，并且想出更多办法，为实现新的跃进指标而奋斗。这时候，总结和推广好的工作方法和好的经验，具有很大的意义。在全市1月份提前完成月计划的一百个工矿企业中，我们应该首先总结一些好的经验。
    究竟有些什么突出的好经验呢？在这里，我们应该承认的头一条重要的经验就是：一切主客观的条件都是可变的。这是具有普遍意义的一个命题。比如，琉璃河水泥厂的经验表明，同样是不充足的原料，同样是原有的那些机器设备，同样是不够用的劳动力，在过去算成困难的条件，现在却不成其为困难条件了，也就是说，由困难的条件变成不是困难的条件了。为什么会发生这样的变化呢？这就因为他们深入地发动群众，依靠群众，千方百计地想尽办法克服困难，提早准备，抓紧检查，合理地调配人力、物力和时间。他们继续坚持贯彻党的群众路线，大搞群众运动，这是他们能够在新的年度一开始就表现出新的大跃进成绩的关键所在。这个经验说穿了毫无奥妙，但是当人们不知道这样做或者不愿意这样做的时候，它却似乎妙不可言。现在我们就要到处宣传这个经验，让每一个人都懂得这个道理。
    这是不是说我们可以完全不顾任何实际条件而为所欲为呢？当然不是。任何事情要做得成功，都要有一定的客观条件和主观条件。但是，我们决不应该把这些条件看得绝对化和神秘化了，不应该陷入“唯条件论”的泥坑，不要把任何条件看成不可改变的。我们要看到，客观条件常常有许多是有利的，也有一些是不利的。有利的条件常常又有克服不利条件的潜在的可能性。主观条件也常常有不利的和有利的两方面，它本身更充满着可变性，就是说，充满着克服不利条件的潜在力。同时，客观条件和主观条件还常常互相影响，引起一系列新的变化。
    投身于大跃进高潮中的人们，对于主客观条件应该根据唯物辩证法，从发展变化的过程中去分析，用动的观点去分析，而不要从静止的状态中去分析，不要用形而上学的观点去分析。只要我们正确地分析各种条件，善于采取主动，促进主客观条件向着更加有利于我们的方向发展，我们的社会主义建设就一定会有更大的跃进。
    当我们今年1月份提前完成了工业生产计划的时候，我们决不可产生骄傲自满的情绪，大家要更加努力，进一步争取提前完成第一季度的生产计划。目前正是新春季节，我们盼望这个美丽的春天给我们带来不断跃进的高潮。要记住，“不进则退”，这是古人早已发现了的最普通的道理。我们在大跃进的高潮中，尤其要坚持不断的跃进。如果满足于已得的成绩而停下或放慢了脚步，那末，在别人继续大踏步前进的时候，你就将远远地落在后面。每个有志气的人当然不能甘心落后，我们永远要比先进，赶先进！
    “别人能做到的，我们也应该做得到。”这句话是有道理的。如果不是片面地了解，而是全面地分析这个问题，那末，我们应该承认，在条件基本相同的情况下，同样的生产或同样的工作，应该能够做出同样的结果。如果条件基本相同而结果大不相同，那末，我们就只能说这是主观努力程度悬殊所造成的。因为主观能动性在一定的程度上无疑地能够促使客观条件的变化。硬说自己的条件不如人，硬说别人能够做到的自己做不到，这种人现在没有了，希望以后再也不会出现。
    在大跃进的高潮中，我们将会看到各个战线上出现更多的英雄模范人物。人人要比干劲，要敢想、敢说、敢干，这些是社会主义建设者应有的品德和风格。这种品德和风格，与虚夸作风毫无相同之点。前一种风格是科学的马克思主义者的特色，后一种作风乃是旧社会遗留的官僚政客作风的残余。我们要努力提倡的是前一种好风格，我们要坚决反对的是后一种坏作风。
    我们是社会主义的建设者，我们是科学的马克思主义者，我们的事业是旷古未有的伟大事业，我们为了这个伟大事业而不断奋斗，我们人人都要成为顶天立地的革命英雄。这完全不是虚夸，而是我们应有的抱负。我们要干劲冲天，又要脚踏实地，这不是顶天立地吗？我们要不断革命，要做出前人所不敢想像的事情，这不是革命英雄是什么呢？“数风流人物还看今朝”，但愿我们的英雄人物随着新春而俱来，愿我们的每一个人在今年大跃进的高潮中都做出巨大的贡献。
