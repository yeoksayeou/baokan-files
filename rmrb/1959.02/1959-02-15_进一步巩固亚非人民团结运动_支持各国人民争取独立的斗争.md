    Further Consolidate the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Movement
    Support the Struggle of All Countries' People for Independence
    Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council Meeting Adopts a Series of Resolutions on Consolidating the Solidarity Movement
    The resolution on consolidating the solidarity movement adopted by the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council meeting today pointed out that the national solidarity committees of various countries have made great efforts to deal with the plots and aggressions carried out by imperialism last year to undermine the freedom of the Afro-Asian people.

    The resolution said that the Council studied the issue of countries where solidarity committees have not been established. The resolution said that some are dependent countries, where it is difficult to establish such committees before imperialism is eliminated, and some independent countries' governments are not interested in the solidarity movement, and even oppose it in some cases.

    The resolution requests:
    First, strengthen the means of reliably exchanging news of the solidarity movement, especially with those countries where imperialism has built an iron curtain around them;
    Second, establish committees composed of nationalists who do not live in their own country, and establish solid connections between the committees and their people and the secretariat;
    Third, the solidarity committees of independent countries with overseas Chinese residing in colonial territories should contact the overseas Chinese in each country and ask the overseas Chinese to support the nationalist movement in the colonial territories where they live;
    Fourth, send representatives to countries where solidarity committees have not been established to help them establish such organizations.

    The resolution said that the Council studied various trends opposing the solidarity movement and ways to deal with them, and decided to emphasize the importance of establishing solidarity among the Afro-Asian people as the only way to obtain a future of freedom, prosperity and happiness, in order to resist all actions aimed at creating discord among the Afro-Asian people. The resolution calls for the use of various communication methods to spread the true concept of solidarity.

    When talking about future cooperation with the Permanent Secretariat of the All-African People's Conference in Accra, the Permanent Bureau of the Afro-Asian Writers' Conference in Colombo and any similar organizations, the resolution suggests: mutual sending of representatives, exchange of publications, full cooperation between them to implement their respective resolutions, cooperation in guiding public opinion in the cause of freedom, peace and equality, coordinated anti-imperialist movements, further strengthening the unity and mutual support of all anti-imperialist forces, and cooperation in propaganda to expose and thwart imperialist attempts to undermine the solidarity movement through divisive activities and slander.

    The resolution decided to authorize the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council to contact the national solidarity committees in order to obtain an invitation from one of the solidarity committees to hold the next solidarity conference in its country. The conference held in Cairo has stipulated that the next conference will be held within one year.
Supporting the Political Resolution on the Independence Struggle of the People of All Countries
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 13th: The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council meeting on the 13th passed a number of political resolutions expressing support for the struggle of the people of all countries for independence.

    Regarding the Algerian issue, the resolution said that the Council recommends that all Afro-Asian countries that have not yet recognized the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria recognize this provisional government. The Council calls on the people of all Afro-Asian countries to find appropriate ways to prevent their countries' governments from helping France in the future, and to implement the principle of economic boycott against France.

    Regarding the Oman issue, the resolution said that the Council supports the discussion of the Oman issue in the United Nations, and decided to designate July 18 as Oman Day, on which to provide material and moral support to Oman.

    Regarding the Palestinian issue, the resolution said that Israel is an imperialist base, threatening the progress and security of the Middle East. The Council condemns Israel's aggressive policies, which are a threat to world peace. The Council supports the right of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland.

    Regarding the Iraqi issue, the resolution said that the Council condemns the Baghdad Pact and imperialist conspiracies, as well as the decisions made by the imperialists at the Karachi meeting of the Baghdad Pact Council, which aimed to create discord among the Arabs.

    Regarding the Moroccan issue, the resolution expresses support for the Moroccan people's struggle for independence and sovereignty, and demands the withdrawal of foreign troops and the removal of military bases from Morocco.

    Regarding the Bahrain issue, the resolution said that the Council supports the Bahraini people's struggle for independence, and demands the immediate release of the arrested local political leaders.

    Regarding the Jordanian issue, the resolution said that the Council supports the Jordanian people's struggle against US imperialism and reactionaries. The Council demands an end to US imperialist interference in Jordan, and condemns the terrorist actions taken by the pro-imperialist authorities in Jordan against nationalists.

    Regarding the Kenyan issue, the resolution said that the Council condemns the continued maintenance of a state of emergency in Kenya, and demands an immediate end to this state.

    Regarding the Equatorial African issue, the resolution condemns the large-scale massacres carried out by France in Equatorial Africa and France's determination to subordinate the people of this region to it through its so-called French Community. The Council affirms that it unreservedly supports the people of Equatorial Africa and their demands for freedom, independence and unity.

    Regarding the Somaliland issue, the resolution expresses support for the Somaliland people's struggle to achieve independence and unity, and condemns Britain's actions in creating a legislative council in the area, which will only serve the interests of imperialism.

    Regarding the so-called referendum held by de Gaulle in France's colonies and dependent countries, the resolution said that the Council condemns all the indecent means and undemocratic methods used by imperialism in the referendum, and points out that this referendum must be considered invalid, worthless and should be abolished.

    The resolution protesting the South Vietnamese massacre said that the Council is deeply shocked by the tragic death of more than 1,000 imprisoned personnel in the Phu Loi concentration camp in South Vietnam due to food poisoning. This is the most inhumane act in violation of the Geneva Accords. The Council condemns the Phu Loi massacre, demands an end to all terror and retaliation in South Vietnam, demands an end to all US imperialist interference in South Vietnam, and demands the reunification of Vietnam on the basis of the Geneva Accords.

    Regarding the Mongolian issue, the resolution said that the Council requests the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committees of all countries and all peace-loving forces in the world to designate July 11, 1959 as a day of solidarity with Mongolia, and to ensure Mongolia's right to enter the United Nations.

    Regarding the Korean issue, the resolution said that the Council welcomes the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from northern Korea, which has created new opportunities for resolving the Korean issue. The Council believes that the US military's violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, its continued stationing in South Korea, and the establishment and continuous expansion of its nuclear and missile bases in South Korea is a serious threat to peace in Korea, Asia and the world. The Council demands the immediate withdrawal of US troops from South Korea, and emphasizes that Korea should be reunified by the Korean people themselves on a democratic basis and in a peaceful manner without foreign interference.

    Regarding the joint action against nuclear weapons, the resolution said that the Council supports the Fifth World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament to be held in Hiroshima, and recommends that countries organize "peace marches" to Hiroshima. The Council recommends that joint action be taken on March 1, 1959 to commemorate the damage caused by the hydrogen bomb test five years ago (the crew of the Japanese fishing boat "Lucky Dragon" died due to contamination with radioactive dust released during the US hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific) in order to further strengthen the determination to oppose nuclear testing.

    The Council expressed its full support for the special meeting to be held by the World Peace Council in May 1959 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the World Peace Movement.

    The resolution on women and children recommends convening an Afro-Asian Women's Conference before the end of 1959.

    The resolution said: "The long-term aggression of US imperialism against the People's Republic of China and the continued occupation of Taiwan by US troops must be taken as the theme of a broad movement. 'No Interference in China' days can be held on the Asian and African continents."

    Talking about the future work of the Solidarity Council, the resolution said that in the coming year, Algeria's war for freedom will definitely develop to a higher stage.
