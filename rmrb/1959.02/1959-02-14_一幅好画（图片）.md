A Good Painting (Picture)
    The painting above is titled "The Eve," and the artist is the Soviet painter Kosmachev. It was an exhibit at the Socialist Countries Fine Arts Exhibition in Moscow.
    In the picture, the great revolutionary teacher Lenin is standing on a small wooden boat with his hands behind his back, gazing intently into the distance. The distance is the Russian motherland on the eve of the revolution. In 1917, Lenin, seeking refuge at Razliv Lake, was concerned about the revolution in his motherland day and night. Now, the motherland is before him, and an earth-shattering revolutionary storm is approaching. Facing this scene, how could one not feel "one's heart surge with the waves?"
    All of this is not visible in the painting. Around the wooden boat, there is only a vast expanse of misty water, nothing else. However, following Lenin's gaze, we see many scenes; in this silent painting, there is a sense of impending earth-shattering sound.
    This is a good painting that speaks volumes without words.

    一幅好画（图片）    
    上面这幅画，题目叫“前夜”，作者是苏联画家科斯马切夫。这是在莫斯科举行的社会主义国家造型艺术展览会的展品。
    画面上，伟大的革命导师列宁正站在小木船上背着双手，凝神地眺望着远方。远方，就是正处在革命前夜的俄罗斯祖国。1917年，在拉兹里夫湖避难的列宁，日夜关心着祖国的革命。现在祖国就在面前，翻天复地的革命风暴临近了。面对着此情此景，怎能不“心潮逐浪高”呢？
    这一切，在画面上是看不到的。在木船的周围，只是一片茫茫的烟水，什么也没有。然而，我们随着列宁的眼神，看到许许多多景物；在这寂静的画幅中，孕含着即将到来的惊天动地的声音。
    这是一幅尽在不言中的好画。
