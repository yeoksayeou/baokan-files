Xinhua News Agency, February 6th: According to a report in the Soviet "Pravda": Ajoy Ghosh, General Secretary of the National Council of the Communist Party of India, delivered a congratulatory speech at the 21st Congress of the CPSU on the afternoon of the 3rd. The full text is as follows:

    Dear Comrades! On behalf of our party, our country's working class, peasants, and working intellectuals, and all peace-loving people of our country, I extend heartfelt, warm, and fraternal greetings to the Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to its Central Committee, and to the entire Soviet people. (Applause)
    Your congress is being held at a time when socialist construction has achieved new and enormous successes. The Soviet Union was the first country in the world to launch artificial earth satellites, and it has taken a giant step forward in conquering the universe, building a new planet in the solar system. The Soviet Union, the first country in the world to build socialism, has completed the historic resolutions of the 20th Congress, laid out the path for further development in the world-renowned Seven-Year Plan, and entered a new stage of development—the stage of fully unfolding the construction of a communist society.

    The vigorous development of the People's Republic of China has also shocked the world. The achievements of all other countries that have embarked on the path of socialism are also enormous in all aspects.

    The Soviet Union's great achievements in peaceful construction, in science, technology, and culture, and in improving the people's welfare are also a serious blow to the ideological system of the imperialists and a powerful refutation of the harmful theories of the revisionists. This is the greatest victory of the immortal Marxist-Leninist doctrine. The Marxist-Leninist doctrine has in the past and continues now to point out the way forward for humanity, the way to a new life.

    These achievements add immeasurable strength to the cause of all good people in the world—the sacred cause of peace and freedom. The socialist camp is a fortress of peace, and in close cooperation with all peace-loving forces, it has continuously shattered the various conspiracies of the aggressive imperialist camp headed by the United States in recent years, a camp that threatens the freedom of small countries and attempts to drag the world into a terrible new war. The Soviet Union constantly puts forward concrete proposals to rid the world of the danger of atomic war and to stop nuclear testing. Therefore, it is not surprising that ordinary people all over the world see the growing power of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp as a reliable guarantee of peace, freedom, and independence for all countries. This is especially true for the people of Asia and Africa, where the colonial system is collapsing, and many countries have gained national independence and embarked on the path of independent development. The economic agreements signed between many of these countries and the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp have helped and are helping these countries strengthen their own economies and national independence, enabling them to resist the pressure of the imperialists. The prospects of the Seven-Year Plan are a factor of great political and economic significance for the people of Asia and Africa.

    At the same time, we cannot ignore the ominous fact that the imperialists, after suffering serious defeats, are stepping up their active operations. They continue to prepare for war. They are desperately trying to maintain the remaining positions in Asia and Africa and are attempting to regain the positions they have lost in these countries by means of economic pressure and with the help of the self-seeking and subservient reactionary elements in these countries.

    As the hatred of the people of all countries for military treaties such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact grows day by day, and as the demand for an independent foreign policy from Asian countries becomes stronger, the American imperialists and their running dogs have begun to wantonly attack all democratic systems in many countries in Asia and to support military dictatorship systems.

    Under these conditions, it is a very urgent and primary task to wage a resolute struggle against the political and economic conspiracies of the imperialists and their running dogs, and to unite all democratic forces to consolidate democratic systems.

    The continuous development of close friendship, the signing of economic agreements, the exchange of cultures, and cooperation in the cause of defending peace are the characteristics of the mutual relations between India and the Soviet Union in recent years. The Republic of India, which defends the cause of peace and resolutely defends and consolidates its national independence, has made a great contribution to the cause of international friendship, as embodied in the historic Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    In recent years, the reputation of socialist ideas has also greatly increased in our country, and the struggle for friendship with the Soviet Union and China, for solidarity with the people of Asia and Africa, and for democratic reforms has also been strengthened. Standing at the forefront of this struggle is the Communist Party of India, which, despite facing great difficulties and very complex tasks, has risen to become the second largest party in our country. In the first general election in 1951-1952, our party, which had just moved from underground to open activity, won six million votes, accounting for 6% of the total number of voters. In the second general election held two years ago, we won twelve million votes, accounting for 10.6% of all votes. We are the main opposition party in the Indian Parliament and the main force of the working class. We also lead the government of the state of Kerala, which has a population of more than thirteen million.

    Our party, following the ever-victorious Marxist-Leninist ideology and the principles of proletarian internationalism, strives to implement policies that are in line with the objective conditions of India and the excellent traditions of the great Indian people. We strive to unite all patriotic forces in our country to defend peace, oppose all forms of colonialism, consolidate national freedom and economy, implement democratic reforms in all aspects of life, protect the interests of the working class, and protect and consolidate democratic systems. The growth of the world communist movement and our own achievements (although these achievements are not great due to the requirements and possibilities of the situation) fill us with firm confidence in the future. We have no doubt that the work and resolutions of this congress will provide us and all communist parties with great help. We believe that it will provide the world workers' movement with new ideological weapons. We also believe that the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will be a new milestone in the triumphal march of socialism and communism.

    Long live the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union! (Applause)
    Long live the Party of Lenin—the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the builder of communism! (Applause)
    Long live the Soviet people! (Applause)
    Long live world peace! (Applause)
    Long live the friendship between the Soviet Union and India! (Applause)
    Indians and Russians are brothers! (Stormy, prolonged applause. All rise.)

### 印度共产党总书记  高士在苏共代表大会上的讲话

    印度共产党总书记
    高士在苏共代表大会上的讲话
    新华社6日讯　据苏联“真理报”报道：印度共产党全国委员会总书记高士3日下午在苏共第二十一次代表大会上致贺词，全文如下：
    亲爱的同志们！我代表我们党、我国工人阶级、农民和劳动的知识分子以及我国一切热爱和平的人民，向苏联共产党代表大会、向它的中央委员会和全体苏联人民致以衷心的、热烈的和兄弟的敬礼。（掌声）
    你们的代表大会是在社会主义建设获得了新的巨大成就的时候举行的。苏联是世界上第一个发射了人造地球卫星的国家，它又在人征服宇宙方面迈进了巨大的一步，建造了太阳系的新行星。第一个在世界上建起了社会主义的苏联，完成了第二十次代表大会的具有历史意义的决议，在世界闻名的七年计划中规定了进一步发展的道路，进入了新的发展阶段——全面展开共产主义社会建设的阶段。
    中华人民共和国的蓬勃发展也震惊着全世界。其他一切走上了社会主义道路的国家在各方面的成就也是巨大的。
    苏联在和平建设方面，在科学、技术和文化方面以及在提高人民福利方面所取得的巨大成就，同时也是对帝国主义者的思想体系的严重打击，对修正主义者的有害理论的有力反驳。这是不朽的马克思列宁主义学说的极伟大的胜利。马克思列宁主义学说过去和现在都给人类指出前进的道路，指出走向新生活的道路。
    这些成就给全世界善良的人们的事业——和平和自由的神圣事业增添了无比的力量。社会主义阵营是和平的堡垒，它在同一切爱好和平的力量的密切合作下，近年来不断打破了以美国为首的侵略性的帝国主义阵营的种种阴谋，这个阵营威胁小国的自由并企图把世界拖入可怕的新战争旋涡。苏联不断提出使世界摆脱原子战争的危险和停止核试验的具体建议。因此毫不奇怪，全世界普通人民把苏联和社会主义阵营日益增长的威力看作是一切国家的和平、自由和独立的可靠保证。对亚非各国人民说来特别是这样，在这里殖民制度正在崩溃，许多国家已经获得了民族独立并走上了独立发展的道路。这些国家中的许多国家同苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家签订的经济协定帮助了并正在帮助着这些国家加强本国的经济和民族独立，使它们能够反抗帝国主义者的压力。七年计划的前景对亚非各国人民说来是个具有巨大政治意义和经济意义的因素。
    同时，我们也不能忽视这样一个不祥的事实，即帝国主义者在遭到了严重失败后，正加紧积极活动。他们继续准备战争。他们疯狂地企图保持在亚非国家中所残留的阵地，并企图利用对亚非国家施加经济压力的手段和在这些国家中的卖身求荣、卑恭屈节的反动分子的帮助下，夺回在这些国家中失去的阵地。
    由于各国人民对于像北大西洋公约和巴格达条约这些军事条约的憎恨与日俱增，由于亚洲各国实行独立外交政策的要求日益强烈，美国帝国主义者及其走狗开始在亚洲的许多国家中猖狂地进攻一切民主体制，扶植军事专政制度。
    在这种条件下，对帝国主义者及其走狗的政治和经济阴谋进行坚决的斗争，联合一切民主力量来巩固民主体制是非常迫切和主要的任务。
    密切友谊的不断发展，经济协定的签订，文化的交流和在保卫和平事业中的合作，是近年来印度和苏联的相互关系的特点。保卫和平事业并坚决捍卫和巩固本国民族独立的印度共和国，给国际友好的事业作出了巨大的贡献，这表现在有历史意义的潘查希拉原则上。
    在最近几年中，社会主义思想在我国的声誉也大大提高了，争取同苏联和中国的友谊、争取同亚非各国人民的团结、争取民主改革的斗争也加强了。站在这个斗争最前列的是印度共产党，尽管它面临着巨大的困难和非常复杂的任务，仍然跃升为我国第二大党。在1951—1952年的第一次普选时，我们党刚从地下转为公开活动，就获得了六百万张选票，即占参加投票的总人数的6％。在两年前举行的第二次普选中，我们获得了一千二百万张选票，占全部选票的10.6％。我们是印度国会中的主要反对党和工人阶级的主要力量。我们还领导着有一千三百多万居民的喀拉拉邦的政府。
    我们党遵循着百战百胜的马克思列宁主义思想和无产阶级国际主义原则，力求实行符合于印度客观情况和伟大印度人民优秀传统的政策。我们力求联合我国的一切爱国力量来保卫和平，反对一切形式的殖民主义，巩固民族自由和经济，在生活的一切方面实行民主改革，保护工人阶级的利益以及保护和巩固民主体制。世界共产主义运动的增长以及我们自己的成就（虽然由于情况的要求和可能性，这些成就还不算大）使我们对未来充满坚定的信心。我们毫不怀疑，这次代表大会的工作和决议会给我们和所有共产党以巨大的帮助。我们相信，它会给世界工人运动提供新的思想武器。我们还相信，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会将是社会主义和共产主义凯歌行进中的新的路标。
    苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会万岁！（掌声）
    列宁的党——共产主义建设者——苏联共产党万岁！（掌声）
    苏联人民万岁！（掌声）
    世界和平万岁！（掌声）
    苏联和印度的友谊万岁！（掌声）
    印度人和俄罗斯人是兄弟！（暴风雨般的、长时间的掌声。全体起立）（附图片）
