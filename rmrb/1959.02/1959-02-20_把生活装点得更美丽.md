    Making Life More Beautiful
    Arts and crafts are closely related to people's lives. From buildings to teacups, table lamps, and children's toys, they not only serve practical purposes but should also strive to satisfy people's need for aesthetic appreciation. China's arts and crafts have a long and brilliant tradition and are a valuable part of our national culture, fully demonstrating the wisdom of the Chinese working people. The establishment of the bimonthly arts and crafts magazine "Decoration" can be said to be meaningful. Three issues have been published so far, each containing articles by experts, covering a wide range of topics, including weaving, drawnwork, blue printed cloth, clothing, ceramics, lacquer carving and stone carving, clay and wood toys, etc. In the "Great Leap Forward in Modern Industry" column, various domestically produced cars are reviewed from the perspective of styling and decoration. This is a new page in the history of arts and crafts. Some articles review many daily necessities and other excellent light industrial products. Some articles discuss large-scale decorative sculptures such as the Monument to the People's Heroes, the glazed screen walls and stone carvings of the Forbidden City in Beijing, and the white walls and window decorations of Jiangnan. There are also studies on the art of bookbinding, and research on decorative motifs of traditional crafts such as fish, dragon, and phoenix shapes, as well as introductions to the exquisite folk handicrafts of various regions and ethnic minorities, such as drawnwork, embroidery, weaving, ceramics, and women's clothing. In addition, there are creations and designs for posters and mobile exhibition stands. This is a helpful publication for professional workers, and at the same time, through many texts and pictures, general readers can also increase their understanding of ancient and modern Chinese decorative art and improve their aesthetic appreciation ability.

    把生活装点得更美丽
    工艺美术和人们的生活是有密切关系的。大至于建筑物，小至于茶杯、台灯、儿童玩具，它们既供实用，又应尽量满足人们对于美的欣赏的需要。我国工艺美术有着悠久而光辉的传统，是我国民族文化的宝贵的一部分，充分地表现了我国劳动人民的智慧。工艺美术双月刊“装饰”的创办应该说是有意义的。现在已出三期，各期都刊登了专家的文章，内容触及很广，有编织、挑花、蓝色印花布、服装、陶瓷、雕漆和金石雕、泥木玩具等。在“现代工业大跃进”栏内，从造型装饰角度评介了我国自己生产的各式小汽车。这是工艺美术史上新的一页。有的文章对许多日用品和其他轻工业优秀产品作了评介。有的文章对大型装饰雕刻如人民英雄纪念碑、北京故宫的琉璃迎壁和石雕、江南的白粉墙和窗花，作了论述，还有关于书籍装帧艺术的研究，和对传统工艺的装饰题材如鱼、龙、凤形的考证，对各地和少数民族精致的民间手工艺挑花、刺绣、编织、陶瓷、妇女的服饰都有所介绍。此外还有招贴画、活动展览架的创作和设计。这是一个对专业工作者有帮助的刊物，同时通过许多文字和图片，一般读者也可以增进对我国古代和现代的装饰艺术的了解和提高美术欣赏能力。
