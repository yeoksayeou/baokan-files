    Anhui to Use Rice Transplanters in Most Paddy Fields
    (Our Hefei dispatch, February 20) Anhui Province is promoting rice transplanters earlier and with greater effort to serve the spring plowing and production campaign.
    At the tool reform conference held in Anhui Province in January this year, the issue of comprehensively promoting rice transplanters this year was studied as a key point. It was finally decided to mainly promote the Anqing 9-10 type 2.5-inch rice transplanter (as shown in the right figure), and at the same time promote 290,000 various rice transplanters, so that 60% of the province's rice area will use rice transplanters.
    The advantages of the 9-10 type 2.5 transplanter are that the body is entirely made of bamboo and wood, materials are easy to obtain, and ordinary carpenters can imitate it; the machine weighs about 25 kilograms, is light and flexible, each machine uses 0.14 cubic meters of wood, 4 liang of steel wire, and 1.5 liang of pig bristles; in terms of transplanting quality, the plant spacing is 2 inches, the row spacing is 5 inches, and each mu can transplant 60,000 holes, with qualified seedlings accounting for more than 90% of each hole, which meets the requirements of dense planting; there are very few phenomena of hooking seedlings, damaging seedlings, missing transplants, and floating seedlings; the pulling force is light, and the efficiency is high, with two people operating (one person in charge, one person adding seedlings) can transplant more than 7 mu per day. This is more than 14 times more efficient than manual transplanting. (Attached picture)

    安徽大部水田将用插秧机插秧
    本报合肥20日电　安徽省提早大力推广水稻插秧机，为春耕大生产服务。
    安徽省在今年元月份召开的工具改革会议上，重点地研究了今年全面推广水稻插秧机的问题，最后确定以推广安庆9—10型二五寸水稻插秧机（如右图）为主，同时推广各种水稻插秧机二十九万部，使全省60％水稻面积使用插秧机。
    9—10型二五插秧机的优点是，机身全是竹木结构，材料易取，一般木工都能仿制；机重约二十五公斤，轻便灵活，每部用木材0.14立方，钢丝四两，猪鬃一两五；在插秧质量上，株距二寸，行距五寸，每亩可插六万穴，每穴合格秧棵占90％以上，适合密植的要求；钩秧、伤秧、漏插和漂秧现象极少；拉力轻，效率高，两人操作，（一人掌握，一人添秧）每天可插七亩以上。比人工手插提高功效十四倍多。（附图片）
