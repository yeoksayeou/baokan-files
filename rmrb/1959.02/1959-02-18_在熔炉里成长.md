Growing in the Crucible
　　By Fu Jun, Zhi Jiewen, Our Correspondents

　　In the former meeting room of Beijing No. 49 Middle School, five lathes are neatly arranged, transforming it into a machine shop. Nearby, there's a carpentry workshop in three bungalows, and a spacious fitter's workshop capable of accommodating over eighty workers. This is the classroom that the Wuhua Medical Equipment Factory established within the school to provide students with production labor opportunities.

　　Over one hundred of the school's more than 1,200 students rotate daily to work alongside the factory workers. “Listen to the master’s guidance, and learn from the master with humility” is a red banner posted in the workshop by the students. Working eight or six hours per week, the students produce various sophisticated medical devices, and in just a few months, they have learned the production techniques for more than ten types of products. According to the factory's assessment, the students have generally reached the technical level of a second-grade apprentice in specialized processes.

　　The Wuhua Medical Equipment Factory set up the workshop in the school last November. A production management committee was jointly formed by the factory and the school. The school selected several teachers to guide the students' production labor together with the workers. However, initially, the school lacked experience in organizing students for production labor, and the workers, who were used to training only one or two apprentices, suddenly had to teach more than a dozen students, also lacking good educational methods. The workers enthusiastically guided the students during the day and volunteered to work overtime at night to catch up with production tasks, but as a result, they only completed 93% of the production target in the first month. Later, the workers, based on the students' characteristic of having a certain level of cultural knowledge, first explained the principles to the students before production labor. As a result, the students learned techniques quickly, and production efficiency rapidly improved, completing 167% of the production target in the third month. With production normalized, the school was able to better arrange students' learning and labor according to teaching needs.

　　“Cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture” is the shared responsibility of the school and the factory. The workers were extremely happy to see the students they had personally nurtured changing and growing day by day. Large-character posters praising students constantly appeared in the workshop. In this great crucible of combining education and production labor, the students learned knowledge that was not available in books. They heard stories of old workers being unable to get on a lathe for years and being beaten and scolded when they were apprentices in the old society. Wasn't the scar on the hand of an old worker who patiently taught them production techniques a testament to the old society? A female student named Li Yanyan was afraid of getting oil on her clothes from the lathe when she first came to the workshop. She didn't want to work after a short while. Soon, she changed: wearing a simple work uniform, she skillfully operated the machine, looking just like a worker. Many students take the master workers as their role models to learn from at any time and place.

　　With the workshop set up in the school, the school can organize students to participate in production labor according to teaching needs, organically combining teaching and production labor. Labor has become an important part of the teaching plan. When physics teacher Jiang Keduan worked with the students, he saw that they had to add coolant when producing parts on the lathe, which was related to thermodynamics in the physics class. Therefore, he naturally combined the two in his lectures. When teaching electricity, the physics teacher used the calculation of the lathe's electrical efficiency as homework for the physics class. When teaching geometry, the mathematics teacher took many real objects from the workshop as teaching aids. The students said, "When taught this way, we understand it clearly, remember it firmly, and have a higher interest in learning." Ding Shulan used to be uninterested in physics and often scored 3 or 2 points, but now she feels that the physics class has a lot to do with production labor, and she remembers many principles more clearly. She scored 5 points in the most recent exam. At the work-study exhibition held by the school, many compositions written by the students truthfully reflected their working lives. The teachers' comments were: the content is richer than before, and the emotions are more sincere. The students' feelings are: when writing compositions now, our minds are no longer blank like before, looking at the blackboard, looking out the window, two hours passed, and we wrote a lot of empty words.

　　The students also enriched their theoretical knowledge in labor. One day, when student Wang Xiujuan finished making weights and was about to leave work, she saw her fellow workers counting a large pile of weights one by one. "Is there a simpler way?" At that time, she was learning algebra, and when she thought of the formula for arithmetic series in algebra, her mind suddenly moved. She thought, if she made them while putting the weights into a triangle, wouldn't she be able to calculate it all at once according to this formula? She was so happy that she jumped up, applying the knowledge she had learned to production for the first time. When the students were making metal cones, it took a long time to align them according to the method taught by the workers. They used trigonometric knowledge to calculate a certain angle first, which greatly improved work efficiency. Zhang Xiuqin, a student in the second year of junior high school, used the principle of leverage when assembling balances, which immediately increased production efficiency fourfold.

　　The workers at the school not only guide the students in production labor, but also work with the teachers to study how to compile labor course materials and how to better combine classroom teaching with production labor. Now they have become an indispensable group of new-type teachers in the school. But these workers are also "students" of the school. They study culture at the school in the evening, and the school teachers also enthusiastically help them. Teachers go to the workers' dormitories to ask about production techniques, and workers go to the teachers' dormitories to tutor basic courses such as algebra and literature. In the technical revolution, teachers also helped workers develop multi-axis lathes, which increased production efficiency threefold.

　　The factory's establishment of a workshop in the school enables the school to better combine education with production labor, becoming a fixed, regular, and basic form for students to participate in production labor; it also promotes the factory's production. Now, both the factory and the school increasingly feel the benefits of this collaboration. (Attached photo)

    在熔炉里成长
    本报记者　傅军　智洁纹
    在北京市第四十九中学过去的会议室里，整整齐齐地摆着五台车床，它已成为一个机工车间。在它的附近，还有一个三间平房的木工车间，和一个能容纳八十多个劳动力的宽大的钳工车间。这是五华医疗器械厂在这个学校建立的提供学生参加生产劳动的课堂。
    这个学校的一千二百多学生，每天有一百多学生轮班到这里和工人一起劳动。“听从师傅教导，虚心向师傅学习”，这是学生们贴在车间里的一幅红色标语。学生们以每周八小时或六小时的劳动，在这里生产各种精致医疗器械，在短短的几个月中，已经学会了十多种产品的生产技术。根据工厂的鉴定，学生们在专业工序上现在一般已达到二级徒工的技术水平。
    五华医疗器械厂是去年11月把车间设到学校里来的。厂校双方共同组成了一个管理生产的委员会，学校选派了几个教师和工人一起指导学生生产劳动。但是，一开始学校还缺乏组织学生生产劳动的经验，工人们从过去带一两个徒工，一下子变为带十多个学生，也缺乏好的教育方法。工人们白天热心指导学生，晚上义务加班赶生产任务，但结果第一个月只完成生产任务的93％。后来工人们根据学生有一定文化知识的特点，在生产劳动前，先把道理向学生讲清楚。这样一来，学生们学习技术就快了，生产效率迅速提高，第三个月就完成了生产任务的167％。生产正常了，学校也就能更好地根据教学需要安排学生的学习和劳动了。
    “培养有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者”是学校和工厂的共同责任。工人们看到自己亲手培育的学生们日新月异地变化着，成长着，他们高兴极了，车间里不断出现工人表扬学生的大字报。在教育和生产劳动相结合的这个伟大熔炉里，学生们学到了书本上所没有的知识，他们听到老工人在旧社会里当学徒几年上不了车床和挨打受骂的故事，一位耐心地教他们生产技术的老工人，他手上的伤痕不正是旧社会留下来的印证吗；一个叫黎嬿嬿的女学生刚到车间劳动时，深怕车床上的油弄到身上，干不了一会儿就不想干了。不久，她变了：穿着一身朴素的工作服，熟练地操作机器，俨然是一个工人的模样。许多学生都把老师傅作为自己随时随地学习的榜样。
    车间设在学校，学校能够根据教学需要组织学生参加生产劳动，把教学和生产劳动有机地结合起来。劳动成为教学计划的重要内容之一。物理教师江可端在同学生一起劳动中，看到学生在车床生产零件时要加冷却液，这与物理课热学有联系，因此，他就很自然地在讲课中把两者结合起来。在讲电学时，物理教师把计算车床电工率作为物理课的作业。讲几何时，数学教师就从车间拿了很多实物作教具。学生们说：“照这样讲，既听得明白，又记得牢靠，学习兴趣更高了。”学生丁淑兰过去对物理课不感兴趣，常考三分、二分，现在她感到物理课与生产劳动有很多联系，许多原理记得更清楚了。她在最近一次考试中，已得了五分。在学校举办的勤工俭学展览会上，学生们写的许多作文，都切实地反映了自己的劳动生活。教师们的评语是：内容比过去丰富了，感情更加真切了。学生们的感受是：现在作文时，不再像过去那样脑子空空的，看看黑板，望望窗外，两小时过去了，写了一大堆空话。
    学生们在劳动中也丰富了理论知识。有一天，学生王秀娟作完砝码收工时，看到工人同志逐个地数着一大堆砝码，“能不能有一个简便的办法呢？”当时她正在学代数，想到代数上等差级数的公式时，她的脑子突然一动，她想，如果一边作，一边把砝码放成一个三角，依照这个公式不是一下就算出来了吗？把学到的知识第一次运用在生产中，她高兴得跳起来了。学生们在作金属锥体时，依照工人教给的方法作，要用很长时间才能对准，他们运用三角知识，先算出一定的角度来，结果使工作效率大大提高。初中二年级的学生张秀琴在装天平时，运用杠杆原理，一下子就使生产效率提高了四倍。
    工人们在学校，不仅在生产劳动中指导学生，并且和教师们一起研究如何编写劳动课教材，如何把课堂教学更好地和生产劳动结合起来，现在他们已成为学校中不可缺少的一批新型的教师。但是这些工人们又是学校的“学生”，他们晚上在学校学文化，学校教师也都热心地帮助他们。教师到工人宿舍请教生产技术，工人们到教师宿舍补习代数、文学等基础课。在技术革命中，教师还帮助工人搞出了多轴车床，使生产效率提高三倍。
    工厂在学校设车间，使学校能够更好地把教育与生产劳动结合起来，成为学生参加生产劳动的固定的、经常的基本形式；同时也促进了工厂的生产。现在，厂校双方都越来越感到这种协作的好处了。（附图片）
