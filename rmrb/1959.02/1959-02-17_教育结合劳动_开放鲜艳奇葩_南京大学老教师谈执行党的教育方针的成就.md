Education Combined with Labor: A Brilliant Flower Blooms
Veteran Teachers of Nanjing University Discuss the Achievements of Implementing the Party's Education Policy

    This newspaper reports that the Nanjing University Party Committee, in summarizing its work over the past year, invited veteran teachers from various departments to discuss the situation and problems in implementing the Party's education policy. Over the past year, the veteran teachers have personally witnessed the fruitful results of integrating education with productive labor. They unanimously affirmed the correctness and necessity of the Party's education policy and, based on their own experiences, specifically discussed the achievements of implementing the Party's education policy in various aspects.

    The veteran teachers discussed the issue of linking teaching with practical production. Professor Zhong Chongxin of the Biology Department said: "The education revolution of this year is truly thought-provoking. In the past, although I worked hard on scientific research, I was just going around and around in books, not related to actual production. Now, by combining teaching, production, and scientific research, and incorporating the school's activities into the national plan, teaching can directly serve production and construction." Professor Wang Xicheng said: "In the past, he always thought that there were no theoretical or scientific research problems in production. Now he is engaged in researching the problem raised by the aquatic products department of enabling the four major Chinese carps, grass carp, silver carp, and bighead carp, to spawn in inland lakes and breeding farms." He said that this is both a production problem and a scientific theoretical problem with high standards. Associate Professor Zhou Boxun of the Mathematics and Astronomy Department is studying the imaginary roots of the seventh-degree equation for manufacturing carrier machines for a wire factory. The veteran teachers believe that researching and solving these problems not only contributes to production but also enriches the teaching content. Professor Guo Lingzhi of the Geology Department said that in the past, he had discovered molybdenum mines in Anhui and aluminum mines in Zhejiang, but he did not think that this was related to his teaching and scientific research. This time, he took students to southern Anhui for several months of field exploration and found a coal mine in Xiuning County. After several months of practical training, the students' theoretical knowledge and working ability have been improved. He said that through practice, he also criticized the old textbooks he had compiled in the past and cooperated with the students to compile new textbooks. This shows that the combination of education and productive labor promotes both production and teaching.

    When discussing the role of the Party's mass line and the combination of teachers and students, the veteran teachers felt that this greatly promoted the development of scientific research, improved the quality of teaching, and also further strengthened the relationship between teachers and students, achieving mutual teaching and learning. Professor Chen Shouzhu of the Chinese Department said: "In the past, when we taught, we also encouraged students to think independently, but we didn't know how to do it. Now, under the leadership of the Party Committee, teachers and students cooperate in compiling teaching materials, giving full play to collective wisdom. In just a few months, we compiled six or seven hundred thousand words of teaching materials and reference books, which teachers could not have completed in many years in the past." Associate Professor Zhou Boxun of the Mathematics and Astronomy Department said that the establishment of a "Mathematical Service Company" in the department to serve social production departments has also promoted the progress of teachers. In the past, students did not raise any questions during tutoring, but in the past year, students have raised many questions, forcing teachers to further study. He said that the cooperation between teachers and students created the cutting-edge instrument Maksutov telescope in a short period of time, which shows that the Party's mass line has promoted the rapid development of scientific research.

    The veteran teachers also talked about their gains in transforming their thinking over the past year. They all felt that they had brought some bourgeois teaching viewpoints from the old society. Through criticism or self-examination, they have made progress to varying degrees. They are willing to further study and implement the Party's education policy in order to better improve themselves. In addition, the veteran teachers also put forward some constructive opinions worth considering. The school Party committee will study these opinions in order to better implement the Party's education policy.

    教育结合劳动　开放鲜艳奇葩
    南京大学老教师谈执行党的教育方针的成就
    本报讯　中共南京大学党委在总结一年工作中，邀请各系老教师座谈执行党的教育方针的情况和问题。一年来，老教师们亲眼看到了教育结合生产劳动的硕果，一致肯定了党的教育方针的正确性和必要性，并以自己的体会，从各方面具体谈述了执行党的教育方针的成就。
    老教师们谈到关于教学联系实际结合生产的问题。生物系教授仲崇信说：这一年教育大革命真是发人深省。过去虽然自己也辛辛苦苦地进行科学研究，但尽在书堆里转，和生产实际不相干。现在把教学、生产和科学研究三者结合起来，把学校的活动纳入国家计划，这样教学就能直接为生产建设服务。教授王希成说：过去他一直认为生产上没有什么理论性和科学研究性的问题，现在他正在从事研究水产部门提出来的使青、草、鲢、鳙四大家鱼能在内湖和养殖场产卵的问题。他说，这既是生产上的问题，也是科学理论性较高的问题。数学天文系副教授周伯勋为有线电厂制造载波机正在研究七次方程的虚根。老教师们认为，研究和解决这些问题，不仅对生产有所贡献，而且也充实了教学内容。地质系教授郭令智说，过去，他曾经在安徽发现钼矿，在浙江发现铝矿。但却认为这与自己的教学和科学研究无关。这次带着学生去皖南搞了几个月的野外勘探，在休宁县找到了煤矿。学生们经过几个月的实际锻炼，理论知识和工作能力都有提高。他说，经过实践，他还批判了自己过去编写的旧教材，同学生们合作编写了新教材。这就说明，教育与生产劳动相结合，对生产和教学都有促进作用。
    在谈到党的群众路线，师生结合的作用时，老教师们觉得这大大地促进了科学研究的发展，教学质量的提高，同时也使师生关系进一步密切，达到了教学相长。中文系教授陈瘦竹说，过去我们教书也提让学生独立思考，但不知怎样做。现在党委领导下师生合作编教材，充分发挥了集体智慧。我们在短短几个月的时间里，编写了六、七十万字的教材和参考书，这是过去教师多少年也完不成的。数学天文系副教授周伯勋说，系里成立对社会生产部门服务的“数学服务公司”，也推动了教师们前进。过去，他在辅导时，学生提不出什么问题，这一年来，学生们提的问题很多，逼得教师非进一步钻研不可。他说，师生合作在短期内创制了尖端仪器马克托夫望远镜，这说明党的群众路线促进了科学研究的迅速发展。
    老教师们也谈到了一年来在改造思想方面的收获。他们都感到自己在旧社会带来了一些资产阶级的教学观点，通过批判或自我检查，都有了不同程度的进步。他们愿意进一步学习和贯彻党的教育方针，以便更好地提高自己。此外，老教师们也提出了一些值得参考的建设性意见。校党委将研究这些意见，以便更好地贯彻党的教育方针。
