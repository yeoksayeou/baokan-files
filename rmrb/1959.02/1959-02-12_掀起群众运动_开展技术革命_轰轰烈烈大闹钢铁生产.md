Sichuan: Fighting for More Good Iron

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 11th: Under the battle cry of "Fighting for Steel," the vast number of workers in 65 industrial and mining enterprises in seven special districts, autonomous prefectures, and cities in Yunnan Province have launched a Red Flag competition to fulfill and overfulfill this year's provincial steel production plan.

This major competition is being carried out under the direct leadership of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. Steel plants, machinery factories with steelmaking tasks, coal mines, highway and railway transportation units in Kunming City, Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Qujing Special District, Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Yuxi Special District, Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, and the Beishan area have recently signed contracts to carry out the Red Flag competition for steel production under the direct guidance of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. These units mutually guarantee to further strengthen collaboration and support each other.

The competition immediately brought about a new atmosphere of greater leaps forward on the province's industrial front. At the Kunming Iron and Steel Plant on Lunar New Year's Eve, the ironmaking workshop increased the air volume and raised the furnace temperature, increasing the iron output of No. 2 blast furnace from the usual 20-odd tons per furnace to more than 32 tons; the workers of the youth steelmaking furnace, the holder of the national record for the life of a small acidic side-blown furnace, increased their usual record of 13 furnaces of steel per shift to 16 furnaces on New Year's Eve; the workers of No. 1 electric furnace also created a new record of refining one furnace of steel in 1.17 minutes. In order to ensure the supply of good coal for the steel marshal, the coal miners of the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture have recently begun to use indigenous methods for coal washing before the arrival of equipment.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 11th: Henan Province is vigorously, specially, and tightly grasping the production of coking coal and coke to ensure that the steel marshal is well-fed and well-nourished.

Under the situation in Henan Province where grasping steel must first grasp coke, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee convened a provincial coking coal and coke production meeting on February 3 to specifically arrange this year's coking coal and coke production and capital construction work.

In terms of coking coal production, the provincial state-owned Pingdingshan, Hebi, Yiluo, Guanyintang and other coal mines will produce 6.8 million tons this year. In addition to supporting 3 million tons to other provinces, most of these coking coal will be coked within the province. In order to ensure increased coking coal production, raw materials needed for coal production and capital construction will be given priority to mines and capital construction units that produce coking coal. The transformation of small coal kilns will also focus on small coal kilns that produce coking coal.

In terms of coal washing, in addition to the large-scale coal washing plant in Pingdingshan Tianzhuang with an annual output of 4 million tons, which is currently under construction, and the coal washing plants in Hebi, Yiluo, and Guanyintang with a total of 1.6 million tons, the Ministry of Coal Industry has arranged 17 sets of simple coal washing equipment with an annual coal washing capacity of 300,000 tons. It is estimated that by the end of February, coal washing plants with a production capacity of more than 1 million tons will be put into production. By the second quarter, the province will have coal washing plants with a total production capacity of more than 6 million tons put into production. In terms of coking, in addition to improving and upgrading the existing indigenous coking furnaces, it is planned to build 300 Red Flag No. 2 simple coking furnaces with an annual output of 6,000 tons in Xinxiang, Luoyang, Xuchang, Zhengzhou, Nanyang, Xinyang and other places. These simple coking furnaces are expected to be completed and put into production by the end of March.

Our Newspaper, Jinan, 11th: Shandong Province is currently speeding up the construction of six steel bases in Jinan, Laiwu, Weifang, Linyi, Zibo, and Yixian while rectifying and improving "small indigenous groups" and developing them into "small modern groups." This year's steel production tasks will mainly rely on these bases to complete.

The six steel bases have all been determined after detailed investigation and research, based on the principles of proximity to mines and coal, as well as labor distribution, transportation conditions, geology, and the requirements of rational layout. The construction progress of these steel bases is quite rapid. The Jinan Steel Base, which has the highest iron output in the province, in addition to the Jinan Iron Plant with a daily output of more than 300 tons that was put into production last winter, is currently speeding up the construction of the largest steel backbone enterprise in the province—the Jinan Iron and Steel Plant. Construction of this plant began in early July last year, and the first 255-cubic-meter blast furnace was put into production in December last year. The second 255-cubic-meter blast furnace is now also basically completed. The "small indigenous groups" of the Weifang Steel Base have been rapidly developed into four steel plants with small modern smelting equipment after vigorous rectification and improvement, and all have been put into production; in addition, coking plants, refractory material plants, and mining machinery manufacturing and repair plants and other enterprises serving steel production have been established or will be established, moving towards a complete steel base.

From January 1 to 28, the iron output of 3 to 255-cubic-meter blast furnaces accounted for 86.6% of the province's total iron output; the steel output of the steel bases accounted for more than one-third of the province's total steel output.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 11th: Anhui Province seized the construction of "small modern groups" while vigorously developing "small indigenous groups" last year, laying a good foundation for this year's ironmaking production. The province has built 1,100 small modern blast furnaces with a volume of 8 to 28 cubic meters, of which 493 are currently in production. In January this year, the province produced a total of more than 107,000 tons of pig iron, with an average daily output of 3,500 tons, and the highest daily output reached more than 4,000 tons.

The 493 small modern blast furnaces that have been put into production have been operating relatively normally for more than four months since they were put into operation. Moreover, under the slogan of "using less coke and producing more iron," workers in various places have adopted measures such as dedicated management and strengthened maintenance and inspection of equipment, which has reduced fuel consumption. Generally, only 1.5 tons of local coke is needed to refine one ton of good iron. Several small modern blast furnaces in the Provincial Party Committee Steel Plant and Jianchang Steel Plant are better. According to tests, only 1.1 tons and 0.95 tons of coke are needed to refine one ton of iron.

Anhui Province constantly mobilizes workers to carry out technical revolution to increase pig iron production and quality. At present, steel plants in Hefei, Huainan, Bengbu, Wuhu and other places have mostly realized mechanization of crushing and hoisting, vehicle transportation, automation of furnace top charging, and gasification of roasting ore, which greatly improves work efficiency.

Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 11th: On the basis of overfulfilling the January pig iron production plan, the 3 million ironmaking troops in Sichuan are beating the drums of victory and launching a vigorous new upsurge of "improving the utilization coefficient of modern blast furnaces" and "further improving the production quality of indigenous blast furnaces" throughout the province. According to existing materials, if the sulfur content of all pig iron can be reduced to below 0.2%, the province can increase steel production by 100,000 tons and steel by tens of thousands of tons this year without adding any equipment.

Since late January, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and local and county committees have successively held telephone conferences, demanding that greater efforts be made to organize and mobilize the masses to carry out a movement to produce more good iron. In the past few days, many prefectural and county party secretaries have personally gone to the front line to strengthen leadership. The vast number of workers have vigorously carried out technical revolution, and the output and quality of pig iron have generally improved. Fuling Special District generally uses quicklime as a ingredient, which proves that the slag desulfurization ability is higher than that of limestone. Many indigenous blast furnaces have produced good iron. Workers of the Kai County Baiyu Iron Plant in Wanxian Special District use indigenous methods to remove sulfur, which not only increased the daily pig iron output by 22%, but also reduced the sulfur content of iron from 0.4% to about 0.1%. This kind of iron has been successfully refined into steel and rolled into steel. (Attached picture)

The workers of the newly put into production Beijing Steel Plant increased the qualification rate of steel ingots from 81.95% in December last year to more than 90% in January. Now they are continuing to work hard to further improve the output and quality of steel. Xinhua News Agency reporter Du Haizhen

    掀起群众运动　开展技术革命
    轰轰烈烈大闹钢铁生产
    云南　红旗竞赛有声有色
    河　南　大抓特抓炼焦生产
    山　东　加紧建设钢铁基地
    安　徽　“小洋群”大显身手
    四　川　为更多的好铁而战
    新华社昆明11日电　在“为钢而战”的战斗口号下，云南省七个专区、自治州和市的六十五个工矿企业的广大职工，展开了完成和超额完成今年全省钢铁生产计划的红旗竞赛。
    这次大竞赛是在中共云南省委的直接领导下展开的。昆明市、红河哈尼族彝族自治州、曲靖专区、楚雄彝族自治州、玉溪专区、大理白族自治州和北山地区的钢铁厂，有炼钢任务的机械厂，煤矿，公路和铁路运输等单位，最近已在中共云南省委的直接指导下，签订了开展钢铁生产红旗竞赛的合同。这些单位，彼此保证进一步加强协作，互相支援。
    这次竞赛一开始，就使全省工业战线上出现了更大跃进的新气象。昆明钢铁厂在旧历除夕这天，炼铁车间增加风量、提高炉温，使二号高炉由平时每炉产铁二十多吨提高到三十二吨多；小型酸性侧吹炉寿全国纪录的保持者——青年炼钢炉的工人们，在除夕晚上把平时一班炼十三炉钢的纪录提高到了十六炉；一号电炉工人也创造了一点十七分炼一炉钢的新纪录。红河哈尼族彝族自治州的煤矿工人们为了保证供应钢铁元帅好煤，最近不等设备到来就着手采用土法洗煤。
    新华社郑州11日电　河南省正在大抓、特抓、紧抓炼焦煤和焦炭的生产，以保证钢铁元帅吃饱吃好。
    河南省在抓钢铁必先抓焦的形势下，中共河南省委和省人民委员会在2月3日召开全省焦煤焦炭生产会议，具体安排了今年的炼焦煤和焦炭的生产和基本建设工作。
  在炼焦煤的生产方面，省营的平顶山、鹤壁、宜洛、观音堂等煤矿，今年要生产六百八十万吨，这些炼焦煤除了支援外省三百万吨以外，大部分在省内炼焦。为了保证增加炼焦煤生产，对于煤炭生产和基本建设所需要的原材料，将优先供应生产炼焦煤的矿井和基本建设单位。小煤窑的改造，也将以生产炼焦煤的小煤窑为重点。
    在洗煤方面，除了目前正在加紧建设的平顶山田庄年产四百万吨的大型洗煤厂，鹤壁、宜洛、观音堂合计一百六十万吨的洗煤厂以外，由煤炭工业部安排年产三十万吨洗煤能力的简易洗煤设备十七套。预计2月底有生产能力达一百多万吨的洗煤厂可以投入生产。到第二季度，全省将有生产能力共六百多万吨的洗煤厂投入生产。在炼焦方面，除改进提高原有的土法炼焦炉以外，计划在新乡、洛阳、许昌、郑州、南阳、信阳等地建设年产六千吨的红旗二号简易炼焦炉三百座。这些简易炼焦炉预计3月底可全部建成投入生产。
    本报济南11日电　山东省目前在整顿提高“小土群”并向“小洋群”发展的同时，正在加速济南、莱芜、潍坊、临沂、淄博、峄县六个钢铁基地的建设，今年的钢铁生产任务主要将依靠这些基地来完成。
    六个钢铁基地，都是经过详细的调查研究，根据就矿就煤的原则，以及劳力分布、交通条件、地质等情况和布局合理的要求确定的。这些钢铁基地的建设进度相当迅速。全省产铁量最高的济南钢铁基地，除已有一个日产量达三百吨以上的济南铁厂于去冬投入生产以外，目前正在加紧建设省内最大的一个钢铁骨干企业——济南钢铁厂。这个厂在去年7月初动工，第一座二百五十五立方公尺的高炉已在去年12月投入生产，第二座二百五十五立方公尺的高炉现在也基本建成。潍坊钢铁基地的“小土群”经过大力整顿提高，已迅速发展成四个拥有小洋冶炼设备的钢铁厂，并且都已投入生产；此外，还已建立或将建立炼焦厂、耐火材料厂和矿山机械制修厂等为钢铁生产服务的企业，向完整的钢铁基地迈进。
    从1月1日到28日，三至二百五十五立方公尺高炉的产铁量，已占全省总产铁量的86.6％；钢铁基地的钢产量占全省总产钢量的三分之一以上。
    新华社合肥11日电　安徽省去年在大搞“小土群”的同时，抓住了“小洋群”的建设，为今年的炼铁生产打下了良好基础。全省已建成八至二十八立方公尺的小洋高炉一千一百座，目前投入生产的有四百九十三座。今年1月份全省共产生铁十万七千多吨，平均日产量为三千五百吨，最高日产量达到四千多吨。
    已经投入生产的四百九十三座小洋高炉，从开炉到现在四个多月，生产一直比较正常，而且由于各地职工在“少用焦、多出铁”的口号下，采取专人管理，加强对设备的维护检查等措施，降低了燃料的消耗量，一般只要一吨半土焦就可炼出一吨好铁。较好的如省委钢铁厂和缣昌钢铁厂的几个小洋高炉，据试验，炼一吨铁只需要一点一吨和零点九五吨焦。
    安徽省不断地发动职工进行技术革命，提高生铁产量和质量。目前合肥、淮南、蚌埠、芜湖等地的钢铁厂，大都实现了破碎、卷扬机械化，运输车子化，炉顶布料自动化，焙烧矿石煤气化，大大提高了工效。
    本报重庆11日电　四川三百万炼铁大军在超额完成1月份生铁生产计划的基础上，正敲着得胜战鼓，在全省范围内掀起一个轰轰烈烈的“洋高炉提高利用系数”和“土高炉进一步提高生产质量”的新的高潮。根据现有材料计算，如果能把全部生铁的硫分降低到0.2％以下，今年全省就可以作到不增加任何设备，增产钢十万吨和钢材数万吨。
    中共四川省委和各地、县委1月下旬以来，接连召开电话会议，要求拿出更大的劲头，组织、发动群众，开展多出好铁的运动。几天来，许多地、县委书记都亲临前线，加强领导，广大职工大搞技术革命，使生铁产量、质量普遍提高。涪陵专区普遍采用生石灰作配料，证明淘渣脱硫能力比用石灰石要高，许多土高炉都出了好铁，万县专区所属开县白玉铁厂的职工采用土法去硫，不但生铁日产量提高22％，同时也使铁的含硫量由0.4％降低到0.1％左右。用这种铁已顺利地炼成了钢，轧成了钢材。（附图片）
    新投入生产的北京钢厂在1月份工人们把钢锭的合格率由去年12月份的81.95％提高到90％以上。现在在继续努力，进一步提高钢的产量和质量。新华社记者　杜海振摄
