    Sichuan Vigorously Develops Light Industry "Small Native Groups"

    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Chongqing, February 16th) Under the principle of centralized leadership and unified planning, fully utilizing the existing equipment and technical forces of small and medium-sized towns and rural workshops for papermaking, winemaking, sugar refining, etc., and rectifying and improving them, is an important method for Sichuan Province to accelerate the development of rural light industry this year.

    Local methods of papermaking, ceramics, winemaking, and other industries are relatively developed in various parts of Sichuan. In order to solve the current contradiction in the province's light industry of having "large ends" (abundant raw materials, large market demand) and a "small middle" (small production capacity, insufficient equipment), Sichuan Province has decided that this year the people's communes will establish 1,000 small native paper mills, more than 800 ceramic and glass factories, and a large number of alcohol factories and agricultural and sideline product processing factories.

    Various places have already taken active action. The Wenjiang Special District, on the basis of fiber plants, utilized existing water power and steaming equipment, and installed small beaters and paper machines to quickly build paper mills; the papermaking raw materials are all waste materials, coarse fibers, and straw from the fiber plants. After similar small native paper mills are built, the people's communes throughout the province will increase production of 30,000 tons of cultural paper and sanitary paper this year.

    Various places also rely on the masses to use the foundations of old ceramic factories, wineries, and brewing factories to develop emerging industries such as glass, alcohol, monosodium glutamate, and glucose in small and medium-sized towns and rural areas. Many counties have successfully trialed the production of alcohol by installing ceramic distillation towers using the equipment of existing wineries. The Wenjiang Special District added some native equipment to existing brewing and confectionery factories to produce glucose and monosodium glutamate. Using this native method, every 100 jin of flour can produce 2.5 jin of monosodium glutamate and 70 jin of starch, and the starch is then used to make glucose.

    The large-scale development of light industry "small native groups" in small and medium-sized towns and rural areas is a new task. Party committees and light industry departments at all levels in Sichuan have strengthened their leadership over this work. In order to do a good job in the rational use of manpower and materials and avoid unnecessary waste, the recently held provincial light industry conference specially discussed the development plan and factory construction principles for the large-scale operation of "small native groups" for major varieties. The conference required that when helping people's communes establish papermaking and silicate industries, the plans must be included in the entire industrial plan of the people's communes, and the original urban-rural cooperative relationship must be well taken care of, supplying the original enterprises with the necessary raw materials. The conference also required that all localities strengthen the technical transformation of the light industry "small native groups," make full use of hydropower, animal power, and biogas to drive them, and combine native and foreign methods to play a greater role. The conference pointed out that with the development of rural light industry, it is even more important to do a good job in urban-rural cooperation. Cities should help rural areas with technology and equipment, and rural areas should supply cities with more raw materials. To this end, all localities should actively establish cooperation zones, run training courses, and help communes solve technical problems in production.

### 四川大搞轻工业“小土群”

    四川大搞轻工业“小土群”
    本报重庆16日电　在集中领导、统筹安排的原则下，充分利用中小城镇和农村原有造纸、酿酒、制糖等作坊的设备和技术力量，加以整顿提高，这是今年四川省加速发展农村轻工业的一个重要作法。
    四川各地土法造纸、陶瓷、酿酒等工业都比较发达。为解决目前全省轻工业两头大（原料多、市场需量大）、中间小（生产能力小，设备不足）的矛盾，四川省决定今年由人民公社建立小土纸厂一千个，陶瓷玻璃厂八百多个和大批酒精厂、农副产品加工厂等。
    各地已经积极行动起来。温江专区在纤维厂的基础上，利用原有水力和蒸煮设备，安装小型打浆机和造纸机迅速建成造纸厂；造纸原料都是纤维厂的废料、粗纤维和稻草。类似的各种小土纸厂建成以后，今年全省人民公社将增产三万吨文化用纸和卫生用纸。
    各地还依靠群众利用旧有的陶瓷厂、酿酒厂和酿造厂的基础，在中小城镇和农村发展了玻璃、酒精、味精和葡萄糖等新兴的工业。不少县利用原有酿酒厂的设备，安装陶质蒸馏塔试制酒精成功。温江专区在原有酿造厂和糖果厂中添置一些土设备，生产了葡萄糖和味精。用这种土办法，每一百斤面粉可以生产二斤半味精和七十斤淀粉，利用淀粉又制成了葡萄糖。
    中小城镇和农村大搞轻工业“小土群”是一项新的工作。四川各级党委和轻工业部门加强了对这一工作的领导。为了做好人力、物资的合理使用，避免不必要的浪费，最近召开的全省轻工业会议，特别讨论了主要品种大办“小土群”的发展规划和建厂原则。会议要求各地在帮助人民公社兴办造纸和硅酸盐工业过程中，必须把计划列入人民公社的整个工业规划内，并要很好地照顾到原有的城乡协作关系，供给原有企业以必需的原料。会议还要求各地加强对轻工业“小土群”的技术改造，充分利用水力、畜力、沼气带动，作到土洋结合，以便发挥更大作用。会议指出：随着农村轻工业的发展，搞好城乡协作更为重要。城市要以技术和设备帮助农村，农村要以更多的原料供应城市。为此，各地要积极建立协作区，开办训练班，帮助公社解决生产技术上的问题。
