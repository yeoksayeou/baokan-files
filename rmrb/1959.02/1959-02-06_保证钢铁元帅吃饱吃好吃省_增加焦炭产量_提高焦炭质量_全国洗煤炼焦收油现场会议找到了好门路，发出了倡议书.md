Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, February 5th: Under the demand for "good steel and good iron," the national coking industry sector is actively preparing to produce more and better coke to guarantee the needs of the steel marshal. The State Scientific Technological Commission, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Oil Industry, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and the Ministry of Commerce recently jointly convened a national on-site conference on coal washing, coking, and oil recovery in Baoding. Centered on the central topic of vigorously producing coke, the conference widely exchanged experiences and found more and better ways to increase coke production and quality this year.

    The conference pointed out that this year's coke production targets have increased significantly, and a considerable portion of the production tasks will be undertaken by simple coke ovens and indigenous coke kilns. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously improve the existing indigenous coke kiln coking technology and vigorously develop and promote simple coal washing plants and simple coke ovens.

    The conference focused on discussing how to increase coke production and quality, centering on "ensuring that the steel marshal eats his fill, eats well, and saves resources this year." Representatives unanimously agreed that the simple coke oven combining indigenous and foreign methods is the direction of development for the current small and medium-sized coking industry. For example, the "Red Flag No. 2," "Red Flag No. 3," and "Innovation No. 1" simple coke ovens built in Hebei, Northeast China, and other places have many advantages. These simple coke ovens, due to the adoption of the coking principle of large-scale mechanized coke ovens, not only have large output, high coking rate, and short coking time, but also have good coke quality and high oil recovery. At the same time, simple coke ovens are not highly mechanized, and the pipes used can be replaced by ceramic pipes. Building a coking plant with an annual output of 6,000 to 7,000 tons costs no more than 30,000 yuan and can be completed in only about 15 days. After research and comparison, many representatives are prepared to first vigorously promote the "Red Flag No. 2" simple coke oven, and then add coke pushing machines and other equipment to improve its thermal efficiency and increase labor productivity.

    The conference believes that indigenous coke kilns, which are responsible for completing more than one-third of this year's coke production tasks, must be improved and enhanced in terms of coking rate, quality, coking time, and coal consumption. The conference also fully discussed and studied issues such as the kiln type, raw materials, and operating techniques of indigenous coke kilns. The representatives unanimously agreed that the improved Pingxiang-style square kiln and Zhongxing-style round kiln are two relatively good furnace types. The characteristics of these two types of indigenous coke kilns are: higher coking rate, good coke quality, and lower coal consumption, which are suitable for the needs of blast furnaces. In addition, everyone also believes that using semi-coke to make iron can expand the source of coke and should be promoted.

    Developing simple coal washing and rapidly improving coal preparation capacity is an effective way to improve coke quality; and improving coke quality, especially reducing coke sulfur content, is the main key to realizing "good iron, good steel, and steel to become useful materials." The conference believes that under the current conditions, in addition to actively developing large-scale mechanized coal washing plants, building small and medium-sized simple coal washing plants based on wooden piston jigs and flowing washing tanks costs the least and yields the fastest results. Hebei, Shandong, Sichuan, and other places have good experience in this regard. The wooden piston jig used by the Suifeng Coking Plant in Hebei Province not only has high productivity, but also washes out high-quality clean coal. After washing the raw coal with high ash content and difficult to wash, the plant meets the requirements for refining high-quality coke.

    During the conference, representatives from various places also attached great importance to the comprehensive utilization of coal. Representatives unanimously agreed that on the premise of vigorously improving coke quality, the comprehensive utilization of coal should be actively developed, and coal tar should be recovered from indigenous coking and petroleum and chemical raw materials should be extracted. Local experience has proved that tar extraction and processing are not mysterious. As long as attention is paid to it, it is entirely possible to extract oil from indigenous coke kilns. Coking plants in Baoding City use scrap iron drums, earthenware jars, and wooden basins to make simple tools for oil extraction and tar processing. In just over three months, they recovered more than 110 tons of tar; from these tars, they refined more than 40 products such as gasoline, kerosene, light and heavy diesel, paraffin wax, and crude phenols. The plastic made from phenols in tar by the Baoding City Bacterial Fertilizer Plant is very cheap and can be used to make various electrical parts.

    The conference finally emphasized that the many advanced experiences exchanged at this conference should be promoted by various places according to certain natural, economic, and technical equipment conditions and in light of local conditions. At the same time, the conference also requires various places to cultivate and strengthen technical forces through methods such as holding on-site meetings, running training courses, establishing spare-time schools, and cultivating typical examples.

    This conference started on January 22 and ended on January 29. More than 800 representatives from the metallurgical, coal, petroleum, chemical, and commercial departments of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions participated in the conference. During the eight-day meeting, all departments implemented the spirit of cooperation from beginning to end under a common goal.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, February 5th: The National On-Site Conference on Coal Washing, Coking, and Oil Recovery issued a proposal, requiring comrades engaged in coal washing, coking, and petrochemical work across the country to further carry out technical revolution movements, first refine coke to ensure that the blast furnace is full and well-fed, and save coal; at the same time, produce more and better petroleum and chemical products to create more wealth for the country. Aiming at the general situation of small-scale indigenous groups and indigenous-foreign combination of coal washing, coking, and oil recovery work, the proposal put forward the following proposals as common goals of struggle.

    1. Coal Washing:

    1.  Strive to ensure that all coal used for coking is washed this year. 2. Reduce coal washing ash content to below 15% to 9%. 3. Take all active measures to reduce the sulfur content of coking coal to the lowest possible limit. 4. Coal washing recovery rate should reach 50% to 75%.

    2. Coking:

    1.  Coke ash content is required to be reduced to 19% to 11% within this year. 2. Coke sulfur content generally does not exceed 1%. 3. Coke strength must be subjected to drop test; in places where conditions permit, drum test should be carried out, and drum strength generally reaches 250 kg (coke strength for small blast furnaces can be adapted to local conditions). 4. The coking rate of indigenous kilns is generally required to reach more than 65%. 5. In order to expand the source of metallurgical coke, it is necessary to actively improve and promote the experience of using semi-coke to make iron in small and medium-sized blast furnaces, and the ash content of semi-coke is required not to exceed 15%.

    3. By-product recovery:

    1.  Indigenous coking must recover oil. 2. Strive to achieve a tar recovery rate of more than 0.5% to 2% for indigenous kilns. 3. The total recovery rate of by-products such as tar, benzene, and ammonia from simple coke ovens is required to reach 3.5% to 5%. 4. Improve the refining capacity of chemical products and petroleum products, and actively trial-produce new products.

    保证钢铁元帅吃饱吃好吃省
    增加焦炭产量  提高焦炭质量
    全国洗煤炼焦收油现场会议找到了好门路，发出了倡议书
    据新华社保定5日电　在“钢要好钢、铁要好铁”的要求下，全国炼焦工业部门正在积极准备生产又多又好的焦炭，保证钢铁元帅的需要。国家科学技术委员会、冶金工业部、煤炭工业部、石油工业部、化学工业部、商业部等单位，最近在保定联合召开了全国洗煤、炼焦、收油现场会议。会议围绕着大力生产焦炭的中心议题，广泛交流经验，为今年提高焦炭产量和质量找到了更多、更好的门路。
    会议指出，今年的焦炭生产指标有很大增长，有相当大的一部分生产任务将由简易焦炉和土焦窑来承担。因此，必须大力提高现有土焦窑炼焦技术，并且大力发展与推广简易洗煤厂和简易炼焦炉。
    会议围绕“保证今年钢铁元帅吃饱、吃好、吃省”这一中心，着重地讨论了关于提高焦炭产量和质量的问题。代表们一致认为，土洋结合的简易焦炉，是目前中小型炼焦工业的发展方向。如河北、东北等地建设的“红旗二号”、“红旗三号”、“革新一号”简易焦炉，有许多优点。这些简易焦炉由于采用了大型机械化焦炉结焦原理，不仅产量大、成焦率高、结焦时间短，而且焦炭质量好，收油也多。同时，简易炼焦炉机械化程度不高，所用的管道可用陶瓷管代替，建设一座年产六、七千吨的炼焦厂，投资不超过三万元，只用十五天左右的时间就可以建成。经过研究比较，许多代表准备首先大力推广“红旗二号”简易炼焦炉，然后再增加推焦机等设备，改进其热工效能和提高劳动生产率。
    会议认为：担负着完成今年三分之一以上焦炭生产任务的土焦窑，必须在成焦率、质量、结焦时间和煤耗等方面加以改进和提高。会议对于土焦窑的窑型、原料和操作技术等问题，也进行了充分地讨论和研究。代表们一致认为，经过改进的萍乡式方窑和中兴式圆窑，是两种比较好的炉型。这两种土焦窑的特点是：成焦率较高，焦炭质量好，煤耗较低，适合于高炉的需要。此外，大家还认为，采用半焦炼铁可以扩大焦炭来源，应当推广。
    发展简易洗煤，迅速提高选煤能力，是提高焦炭质量的有效方法；而提高焦炭质量，特别是降低焦炭含硫量则是实现“铁要好铁，钢要好钢，钢要成材”的主要关键。会议认为，在目前条件下，除了积极发展大型机械化洗煤厂以外，兴建以木制活塞跳汰机和流洗槽为主的中小型简易洗煤厂，花钱最少、收效最快，河北、山东、四川等地，在这一方面都有了很好的经验。河北省宿风炼焦厂采用的木制活塞跳汰机，不仅生产率高，洗选出来的精煤质量也很好。这个厂将灰分较高而又不易洗的原煤，经过洗选以后，合乎炼优质焦的要求。
    在会议过程中，各地代表对于煤的综合利用问题也十分重视。代表们一致认为，在大力提高焦炭质量的前提下，应当积极发展煤的综合利用，从土法炼焦中回收焦油和提取石油和化工原料。各地经验证明，焦油提取和加工并不神秘，只要加以重视，从土焦窑里提取油是完全可以办到的。保定市各炼焦厂用洋铁筒、瓦缸、木盆做成简单抽油和加工焦油的工具，仅三个多月的时间，回收焦油一百一十多吨；他们从这些焦油中，提炼出汽油、煤油、轻重柴油、石腊、粗酚等四十多种产品。保定市细菌肥料厂用焦油中的酚做成的塑料，价格极廉，可做多种电工零件。
    会议最后强调提出，这次会上所交流的许多先进经验，各地应当根据一定的自然、经济和技术装备条件，因地制宜地加以推广。同时，会议还要求各地通过召开现场会、举办训练班、办业余学校和培养典型等方法，培养和壮大技术力量。
    这次会议从1月22日开始到29日结束。参加会议的有各省、市、自治区的冶金、煤炭、石油、化工和商业等部门的代表共八百多人。八天的会议中，各部门在共同的目标下，自始至终贯彻了协作精神。
    据新华社保定5日电　全国洗煤炼焦收油现场会议发出倡议书，要求全国从事洗煤炼焦石油化工工作的同志进一步开展技术革命运动，首先炼好焦炭保证高炉吃饱、吃好，并节约用煤；同时，生产更多更好的石油、化工产品，为国家创造更多的财富。针对小土群和土洋结合的洗煤、炼焦、收油工作的一般情况，倡议书中提出了以下倡议，作为共同的奋斗目标。
    一、洗煤方面：
    1、争取在今年内做到全部炼焦用煤都经过洗选。2、洗煤灰分降低到15％到9％以下。3、采取一切积极措施把炼焦煤硫分降低到最低限度。4、洗煤回收率要达到50％到75％。
    二、炼焦方面：
    1、焦炭灰分在今年年内要求降低到19％到11％。2、焦炭硫分一般不超过1％。3、焦炭强度，须经落下试验；在有条件的地方要进行转鼓试验，转鼓强度一般达到二百五十公斤（小高炉用焦炭强度，可因地制宜）。4、土窑成焦率一般地要求达到65％以上。5、为扩大冶金焦炭来源，要积极改进和推广中小高炉用半焦炼铁的经验，并且要求半焦灰分不超过15％。
    三、焦化产品回收方面：
    1、土法炼焦必须收油。2、土窑焦油回收率争取达到0.5％到2％以上。3、简易焦炉副产品焦油、苯、氨等的总回收率，要求达到3.5％到5％。4、提高化学产品及石油产品精制能力，积极试制新产品。
