Delivering Manure Like Flying Through Thousands of Mountains and Valleys
    —Record of High-Altitude Transportation in Baode County, Northwestern Shanxi
    Baode County, Shanxi Province (now merged into Hequ and Xing County), located in the Lüliang Mountains, saw its grain yield per mu jump from the traditional level of forty to fifty jin to over two hundred forty jin in 1958. When summarizing this great harvest, the people of Baode County always linked it to the high-altitude transportation that was realized during the Great Leap Forward and appropriately listed the benefits brought by high-altitude transportation last year as the primary favorable condition. It is indeed a major event for people living in deep mountains and steep hills to be freed from the constraints of heavy and arduous transportation conditions and to be able to devote more energy to direct production!
    High Mountains and Steep Ridges Torture People
    Baode County is located in the northwestern Shanxi mountainous area at an altitude of more than 1,300 meters above sea level. The local laboring people describe the arduous roads in the following language: "External cliffs, internal reliance on mountains, roads no wider than three feet, carrying water and manure causes everyone sorrow, climbing the ridge makes one gasp for breath, those over forty suffer from back and leg pain, and those over fifty have hunched backs." Indeed, the rugged mountain roads force the farmers of Baode to endure labor unimaginable to people in the plains year after year: manure must be carried on the back, water must be carried on the back, firewood must be carried on the back, charcoal must be carried on the back, and even the autumn harvest crops must be carried on the back (referred to as "five carries"). When people climb slopes with heavy loads on their backs, they even have to use both hands to touch the ground. People call these roads "kissing slopes," meaning that their mouths are very close to the ground. This transportation situation caused the farmers here to endure the most arduous labor for generations and seriously hindered the development of production. According to calculations, each ordinary laborer here has to spend at least eighty days a year carrying things. Therefore, land cultivation is extensive, and fertilization is minimal. In the old society, the saying circulated in this area: "Hequ and Baode Prefecture, nine out of ten years a failure, men go outside the pass, women pick bitter herbs." After liberation, thanks to the government's care and support, although "nine out of ten years a failure" has become a thing of the past, men no longer go "outside the pass," and women rarely "pick bitter herbs," the difficult transportation conditions have always limited the great development of production here.
    Last year, the horn of the Great Leap Forward was sounded, and the Baode County Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the people of the county to "remove the label of low-yield area." For the farmers of Baode County, this was an arduous task. The grain yield per mu should not be forty to fifty jin, but two to three hundred jin, which not only requires fine processing and increased fertilization but also requires vigorous soil and water conservation. How much labor is needed to complete these tasks? Where does this labor come from? In those days, who in the county was not worried about this problem?
     The Masses Want to Change the Face of Mountainous Transportation
    The great leap in production forced people to use their brains. One day in February last year, Zhang Bingxiang, the party branch secretary of the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Qiaotou Township, stood blankly in the courtyard. At this time, he thought, can we put up a rope to transport things from this mountain to that mountain? If it works, how much labor can be saved! So he immediately found the superior Party committee and put forward his opinion.
    Zhang Bingxiang's opinion was quickly adopted. The First Secretary of the Baode County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party General Branch Secretary of Qiaotou Township personally ran to the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative and summoned several blacksmiths and carpenters to start making aerial transport frames. Objective laws are always like this: the birth of any new thing must go through struggle. At that time, some people said: "Others are too busy, they are too idle." But this did not shake them. On the contrary, they resolutely continued the experiment. The first time, the erected frame failed because the wooden stakes were not buried properly; the second time, it failed because the iron wire was not fastened tightly and bent in the middle and could not pass through; the third time, the pulley failed again. Failing and starting again, after five experiments, the first aerial transport line in Baode County was born.
    The Guangming Agricultural Cooperative’s first aerial transport line appeared, and the county party committee immediately convened a field meeting of the directors of 263 agricultural cooperatives throughout the county. Everyone was particularly interested in this ingenious mountain transportation line. Later, more than 140 agricultural cooperatives signed contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives to purchase iron wire. People were eager to realize aerial transportation as soon as possible. In order to solve the technical problems of manufacturing and erecting high-altitude transportation lines, the Baode County Committee of the Communist Party of China also transferred more than 140 iron, wood, and stonemasons from the county to visit and study on-site. After two days, these people learned a series of techniques such as making aerial transport frames and erecting wires. Thanks to the leadership's attention, good solutions were found to the problems of technology promotion and material supply. Aerial transport frames sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. By the end of last year, more than 400 high-altitude transport lines had been installed on more than 680 mountain tops and 310 mountain gullies throughout the county, accounting for 85% of the 800 mountain tops that could be installed in the county. There are 316 natural villages in the county, of which 281 villages have high-altitude transport lines.
            High-Altitude Transportation Flies Back and Forth
    After being created and put into practical use, the high-altitude transport line was quickly enriched and developed by the laboring people. At first, the high-altitude transport line was only suitable for one-way transportation, that is, sliding things from high to low. Later, it was developed into transporting heavy and light items back and forth in pairs, that is, from the cliff above to the cliff below. Later, some villages also improved the up-and-down transport line into a parallel high-altitude transport line on both sides of the cliff, implementing parallel paired transport. Some agricultural cooperatives also changed the sliding baskets into wooden boxes and installed automatic soil dumping devices. After the creation of thousands of people, four types of high-altitude transport lines appeared in the county. The first type is a simple transport line for up-and-down back-and-forth transport; the second type is a wooden-wheeled, manually operated, winding-pass high-altitude transport line; the third type is a hand-cranked parallel high-altitude transport line between two mountains; and the fourth type is a transport line that slides over mountains and ridges and is driven by a pot-type steam engine. In addition, some places began to use water pipes instead of water buckets, creating a method of transporting water in space. Not only did the types of transport lines increase, but the scope of application also expanded. At first, it was only suitable for transporting soil, rocks, and materials at construction sites. Later, it gradually developed to transport manure, soil, firewood, charcoal, and crops in the fields; and then it developed to transport water and people in the air. For example, when the river water was rising sharply and they could not go down the ditch, the members of Qiaotou Township would sit in the bucket of the high-altitude transport line (called "earth airplane" by the members) to work in the mountain fields on the opposite side. The result of high-altitude transportation is that it not only frees the people of Baode County from
  the heavy labor of "five carries" but also saves a large amount of labor. In the birthplace of high-altitude transportation—the original Guangming Agricultural Cooperative—in the past, two people could only transport twelve dan of manure a day. Now, the same two people can transport one hundred and sixty dan a day through the high-altitude transport line, and they can also bring back sixty dan of bedding soil. Work efficiency has increased eighteen times. In the past, the members of Chengguan fetched water from the ditch outside the South Gate. One person could carry at most eighteen dan a day. Now, using the high-altitude transport line, they can transport one hundred and fifty-four dan of water back in one hour, which can supply one hundred and ten members here for one day, and at the same time, they can bring out three hundred and eight dan of manure while transporting water. Because the improvement in transportation efficiency due to high-altitude transportation is not calculated in percentages but in tens to dozens of times, a large number of laborers throughout the county have been released to invest in production. According to statistics, in less than a year last year, the manpower drawn from transportation increased by 1.35 million labor days in farmland water conservancy construction, land processing, and field management.
            Drawing Out a Large Number of People for Intensive Farming
    A large amount of labor was drawn from transportation and invested in production, which greatly changed the land management situation in Baode County. The era of extensive cultivation, minimal fertilization, and inability to engage in farmland water conservancy construction has gone forever with the advent of high-altitude transportation. Last year, the labor force drawn from transportation in the county reclaimed more than 75,600 mu of paddy fields and built more than 148,400 mu of terraced fields. A huge change also occurred in fertilization: In previous years, the average fertilization of farmland in Baode County was only about ten dan, but last year it reached one hundred dan, and the total amount of fertilizer in the county increased sharply from 3 million dan in 1957 to 30 million dan. If these fertilizers were calculated in the way people used to carry them on their backs, it would take a year to transport them all, but on the high-altitude transport line, it only took a month. Because farmland processing and fertilization have increased, the grain yield per mu last year increased sevenfold from 34 jin and 15 liang in 1957. Therefore, the people of Baode County praised the achievements of high-altitude transportation and said: "The general line is a lighthouse, high mountains and deep gullies listen to people, thousands of mountains and cliffs serve as high frames, tying iron ropes realizes aerial transportation." ·Our Reporter·

    千山万壑送粪如飞
    ——记晋西北保德县高空运输化
    地处吕梁山区的山西省保德县（现已并入河曲、兴县），1958年粮食的亩产量由祖祖辈辈的四、五十斤的水平一下猛提到二百四十多斤。在总结这个大丰收的时候，保德县的人民总是把它和大跃进中实现的高空运输化连起来，总是恰如其分地把去年高空运输化为他们带来的有利条件列到前边。生活在深山峻岭的山区的人们，一下子从繁重、艰巨的运输条件的束缚下解放出来，能够用更多的精力从事直接生产，这确是一件大事！
    高山峻岭折磨着人
    保德县在拔海一千三百多公尺的晋西北山区。那里的劳动人民用这样的语言描述了那种艰难的路途：“外悬崖，内靠山，行路不过三尺宽，背水背粪人人愁，爬上陵坡气直喘，年过四十腰腿痛，到了五十脊背弯”。的确，崎岖的山路使保德的农民经年累月地担负着平原地带人们想像不到的劳动：粪要人背，水要人背，柴要人背，炭要人背，连秋收的庄稼也要人背（称为“五背”）。当人们背上沉重的东西爬坡时，还得两手着地。人们把这种道儿叫做“亲嘴坡”，意即嘴靠着地面很近了。这种交通状况使这里的农民祖祖辈辈地熬受着最艰辛的劳动，并严重地阻碍着生产的发展。据计算，这里的每个普通劳力在一年中至少得花费八十天的时间去背东西。因此，土地耕作粗放、施肥很少。在旧社会时，这个地区流传着：“河曲保德州，十年九不收，男人走口外，女人挑苦菜。”解放以后，由于政府的关怀和支援，虽然“十年九不收”已一去不返，男人也不走“口外”，女人也很少“挑苦菜”了，但是艰难的交通条件始终限制着这里生产的大发展。
    去年，大跃进的号角吹响了，中共保德县委向全县人民提出“摘掉低产区帽子”的号召。对于保德县的农民说来，这是一项艰巨的任务。亩产粮食不是四、五十斤，而是二、三百斤，这不仅需要加工细作，增施肥料，而且需要大力进行水土保持。完成这些任务需要多少劳力？这些劳力从哪里来？在那些日子里，全县谁不为这个问题发愁呢？
     群众要改变山区交通面貌
    生产大跃进逼着人动脑筋。去年2月间的一天中午，桥头乡光明农业社的党支部书记张秉祥在院里呆呆地站着，这时他想，我们能不能架条绳子把东西从这边山上运到那边山上呢？要是能行，那该省多少劳力！于是他立即找到了上级党委，提出了自己的意见。
    张秉祥的意见很快就被采纳了。中共保德县委第一书记、桥头乡党总支书记都亲自跑到了光明农业社，召集了几个铁木匠开始制作空中运输架。客观规律总是这样的：任何新事物的诞生都是要经过斗争的。当时有些人就说：“别人忙的不开交，他们闲的太无聊”。但是这并没有使他们动摇，相反，他们坚决地试验下去，头一次，搭起的架子因为木桩没埋好，失败了；第二次又因为铁丝没拴紧，中间打了弯溜不过去；第三次滑轮出了毛病又失败了。失败了重来，经过五次试验，保德县的第一条空中运输线诞生了。
    光明农业社第一条空中运输线出现，县委立即召集全县二百六十三个农业社的主任开了现场会议，大家对这种奇巧的山地运输线感到格外有兴趣。以后，就有一百四十多个农业社向供销社签订了购买铁丝的合同。人们迫切地要求早一天实现空运化。为了解决制造和架设高空运输线的技术问题，中共保德县委又从全县抽调了一百四十多个铁、木、石匠到现场参观学习，这些人经过了两天功夫就把制作空运架、架线等一系列技术都学会了。由于领导的重视，技术推广和材料供应问题都解决的好，空中运输架就像雨后春笋般地竖立起来。到去年年底，全县已经在六百八十多个山头和三百一十个山沟中安起高空运输线四百多架，占全县可安装的八百个山头的85％。全县共有三百一十六个自然村，其中二百八十一个村用上了高空运输线。
            高空运输往来如飞
    高空运输线经创造并实际运用之后，很快便被劳动人民丰富和发展了。开始时，高空运输线只适用于单程运输，即由高处向低处溜东西。后来就发展成以重带轻，即由崖上崖下来回对运。以后，一些村又把上下式的运输线改进为两崖对岸平行高空运输线，实行平行对运。有的农业社还把滑行的箩头改为木箱子，装上了自动倒土装置。经过千万人的创造，全县便出现了四种高空运输线。第一种是上下来回对运的简易运输线；第二种是木轮人力绞关高空运输线；第三种是两山之间手摇平行高空运输线；第四种是溜山越岭的用锅驼机带动的运输线。此外，有的地方开始采用水管代替水桶，创造了空间运水法。不仅运输线的种类增加，应用范围也扩大了。开始只适用于工地运土、运石、运料，以后便逐渐地发展到田地里运粪、运土、运柴、运炭、运庄稼；再以后发展到空中运水、运人。如桥头乡的社员们，在河水暴涨不能下沟时，就坐上高空运输线的吊斗（社员称为“土飞机”）到对面山地里去劳动。高空运输化的结果，不仅使保德县人民从
  “五背”的繁重劳动中解放出来，而且节省出大量的劳动力。高空运输线的诞生地——原光明农业社，过去送粪两人一天只能运十二担，现在同样是两人，通过高空运输线，一天能运出一百六十担，还能捎回六十担垫圈土来。工作效率提高了十八倍。城关的社员们以往吃水是到南门外的沟里去担，一个人每天至多能担十八担，现在用高空运输线，一小时就能运回一百五十四担水，可供这里一百一十户社员吃一天，同时还能在运水中捎出三百零八担粪。由于高空运输化使运输效率提高不是以百分比计算，而是十几倍到几十倍，因而全县就腾出了大批劳力投入生产。据统计，去年不满一年的时间里，从运输中抽出的人力就使农田水利建设、土地加工、田间管理等方面增加了一百三十五万个劳动日。
            抽出大批人精耕细作
    大量劳力从运输中抽出来投入生产，大大地改变了保德县的土地经营状况。耕作粗放、施肥极少、无力搞农田水利建设的时代随着高空运输化的出现一去不返了。去年全县从运输中抽出来的劳力，开拓了七万五千六百多亩水地，修成了水平梯田十四万八千四百多亩。施肥上也出现了一个巨大的变化：往年，保德县农田施肥平均不过十担左右，去年竟达到一百担，全县总施肥量由1957年的三百万担骤增至三千万担。这些肥料如果照以往人背人担计算，需要一年的时间才能运完，而在高空运输线上，却只用了一个月。由于农田加工施肥增加，去年的粮食亩产量由1957年的三十四斤十五两提高了七倍。因此，保德县的人民歌颂高空运输化的成就说：“总路线是灯塔，高山深沟听人话，千山万崖当高架，拴起铁绳空运化。”·本报记者·
