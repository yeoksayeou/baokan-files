Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, February 20th. Reporter Zheng Boya reports: The workers of Yumen Oilfield, China's largest base for producing natural petroleum, have opened the prelude to a greater leap forward in the petroleum industry this year with boiling enthusiasm. Tens of thousands of workers are engaged in a heroic struggle to double this year's crude oil production, double the drilling footage target, and expand the enterprise's production capacity by two times.

Currently, Jiao Wanhai, Secretary of the Yumen Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and a large number of leading cadres from the city and bureau have gone to the well teams with their bedding, personally directing production at the front line. A vigorous mass movement centered on production, featuring major competitions, major evaluations, major inspections, and major technological revolutions, has rapidly unfolded throughout the entire oilfield. The two thousand workers of the Duckbill Gorge Oilfield, the key area of the oilfield, held a mobilization and skills competition on the 17th, proposing to strive to overfulfill the drilling, oil production, and basic construction plans for February and the first quarter, creating favorable conditions for fulfilling and overfulfilling the annual tasks. Representatives of workers from thirty units made guarantees at the meeting, stating that they would overfulfill their quotas shift by shift, day by day, and month by month, striving to create even greater leap forward achievements this year. Two thousand oil extraction workers from the Oil Production Plant also held a rally in the heavy snow on the 13th, determined to muster their energy and launch a high tide of technological revolution. The average daily crude oil production of this plant since February has increased by 300 tons compared to January. The oil well utilization rate of the women's oil extraction team of the Second Mining Area has reached 100%. Zhao Zongnai, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Oil Production Plant, said that they would analyze and study each oil well, strengthen management, and take all effective measures to increase production. In the technological revolution, the employees of the refinery are all doing their part, combining efforts from top to bottom, and launching a major competition to implement innovation proposals. In just four days after the Spring Festival, they have implemented more than three thousand significant proposals, achieving remarkable results in improving production. Now, new production records are appearing in almost every unit of the oilfield every day. The Beiwu 1207 drilling team, which is drilling new oil wells in the Laojunmiao area, completed 78% of the February plan in early February after overfulfilling the January production plan by 10%. At a pace four times faster than before, construction workers in the Duckbill Gorge Oilfield completed a thirteen-kilometer-long oil and water pipeline and a large oil selection station in six days and nights of hard work and skillful construction in early February.

The production target for Yumen Oilfield this year is an even greater and more ambitious leap forward target than last year. As early as the end of last year, the Yumen Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Yumen Mining Bureau began a series of preparations. On the one hand, they fully estimated the favorable conditions and the enormous potential of this petroleum enterprise, which has been under construction by the state for several years, and on the other hand, they noted the ever-increasing political enthusiasm and soaring vigor of the vast number of workers since the Great Leap Forward last year. They decided to adopt a two-pronged approach to accelerate the pace of construction, making every effort to increase oil production in the old oilfields and vigorously develop new oilfields. Moreover, in accordance with the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical, they adopted the policy of simultaneous exploration, development, and production in the Duckbill Gorge new oilfield, formulated practical and specific measures, and proposed a Great Leap Forward plan to increase the crude oil production of this oilfield by nine times. This has greatly strengthened the production capacity of the entire oilfield.

The huge production tasks for the entire oilfield this year were determined after full discussion by the vast number of workers. At present, all the workers in the oilfield are full of fighting spirit and glowing with energy. Their common determination is: to fight for more and better oil production.

Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, February 20th. The workers constructing Baotou Steel held a rally on the evening of the 18th to pledge to fight for the early production of iron, steel, and steel products. In the brightly lit workers' club, more than two thousand worker representatives and model advanced individuals expressed their determination to complete the iron ore mine, large blast furnace, large open-hearth furnace, large coke oven, and other series of projects ahead of schedule this year, striving to join the ranks of fighting for 18 million tons of steel at the fastest pace.

At the meeting, Chen Shouzhong, First Secretary of the Baotou Steel Party Committee, and Yang Wei, General Manager of Baotou Steel, announced the 1959 battle plan of Baotou Steel. They pointed out that Baotou Steel must complete more than ten important construction projects for the six major plants and mines this year; in terms of production, it must strive to produce a large amount of iron, steel, and steel products. They said that the strong support of the people of the whole country, the active assistance of North China, and the all-out support of Inner Mongolia and Baotou City have given great encouragement to the workers of Baotou Steel. At present, the determination of all the workers of Baotou Steel is: to pass the "three barriers" (ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling) this year and live up to the expectations of the Party and the people of the whole country. The key to passing the "three barriers" lies in basic construction and in the early production of iron. Therefore, in the first half of the year, a full-scale battle should be launched with the No. 1 blast furnace project as the center and the four fronts of mining, water source, coking, and ironmaking as the focus.

Representatives of various fronts such as construction, design, logistics, and various factories and mines expressed their determination at the meeting. The determination of the workers on the construction and production front is: to fight hard, work practically, and work skillfully, and not to leave the front until the task is completed. The guarantee of the logistics workers is: not to be afraid of all kinds of hardships and to ensure that the supply work is done well.

Su Qianyi, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and First Secretary of the Baotou Municipal Committee, spoke at the meeting. He asked the workers of Baotou Steel to do the following things well: before launching the "battle" and attacking the "fortress", check the fighting team and "weapons and ammunition"; implement the spirit of walking on two legs in overcoming difficulties; leading cadres must overcome bureaucracy, regularize the participation of cadres in labor and the cultivation of experimental fields, and do their work more carefully and more solidly; summarize the achievements of last year's technological revolution and popularize the good ones.

Before the mobilization meeting, the workers of Baotou Steel had already launched a struggle on various construction sites with greater vigor. The No. 1 blast furnace has been installed to more than sixty meters. The construction drawing inspection team, composed of leading cadres, veteran workers, and technicians, is working day and night, and they will create a new record again in the installation of the blast furnace dust removal and washing system. Workers at the Baiyun Ebo Iron Mine are working and mining in the icy and snowy weather. The electric locomotive railway track laying project has progressed not far from the main mine. The battle cry of the workers at the water source is: to run ahead of the ice flood.

    按日按月超额完成计划
    玉门油矿职工力争原油产量和钻井进尺加番
    包钢为提前出铁出钢出钢材展开大战
    新华社玉门20日电　记者郑伯亚报道：我国目前最大的生产天然石油的基地——玉门油矿的职工们，以沸腾的热情揭开了今年石油工业更大跃进的序幕。数万名职工正为实现把今年的原油产量翻一番，把钻井进尺指标翻一番，把企业的生产能力扩大两倍而展开英勇奋战。
    目前，中共玉门市委书记焦万海及市、局大批领导干部，均已背着铺盖，深入井队，亲临前线指挥生产。一个以生产为中心的大竞赛、大评比、大检查、大闹技术革命的轰轰烈烈的群众运动，已在全矿范围内迅速开展起来。矿区的重点——鸭儿峡油田的两千名职工，在17日举行誓师比武大会，会上提出了力争超额完成2月份及第一季度钻井、采油和基本建设计划，为完成和超额完成全年任务创造良好条件。共有三十个单位的职工代表在会上提出保证，要做到班班超额、日日超额、月月超额，力争在今年创造出更大的跃进成就。采油厂的二千名采油工人，也在13日大雪纷飞中举行集会，决心鼓足干劲掀起技术革命高潮。这个厂2月份以来的原油日产水平，比1月份提高了三百吨。二矿场女子采油队的油井利用率达到了100％。采油厂党委书记赵宗鼐说，他们要对每一口油井进行分析研究，加强管理，采取一切有效的增产措施。炼油厂的职工在大闹技术革命中，人人动手，上下结合，展开了一个实行革新建议的大竞赛，仅在春节以后的四天里，就实现了较重大的建议三千多条，在提高生产上取得了显著的效果。现在，全矿各单位几乎每天都在出现生产新纪录。在老君庙地区钻新油井的贝乌一二零七钻井队，继超额10％完成1月份生产计划之后，又在2月上旬完成了2月份全月计划的78％。鸭儿峡油田建设工人们，以快于以往四倍的进度，在2月上旬经六昼夜苦战巧干，建成了达十三公里长的油水管线和一座大型选油站。
    玉门油矿今年的生产指标，是一个比去年更大更豪迈的跃进指标。早从去年年底以来，中共玉门市委和玉门矿务局即着手进行了一系列准备工作。他们一方面充分地估计了这个经过国家好几年建设的石油企业各方面的有利条件和存在的巨大潜力，一方面注意到经过去年大跃进以来广大职工日益高涨的政治热情和冲天干劲，决定采取双管齐下的办法，加快建设步伐，既千方百计地叫老油田多出油，又大力开发新油田。并且，他们根据多、快、好、省的精神，在鸭儿峡新油田采取边勘探、边开发、边生产的方针，制订了切实具体的措施，提出了把这块油田的原油产量提高九倍的大跃进规划。这样，就大大地加强了全矿的生产能力。
    全矿今年的巨大生产任务，是经过广大职工群众的充分讨论以后确定下来的。目前，全矿职工个个斗志昂扬，人人精神焕发。他们的共同决心是：为增产更多更好的石油而战。
    新华社包头20日电　建设包钢的职工18日晚上举行了为提前出铁出钢出钢材而战的誓师大会。在灯光辉煌的职工俱乐部里，两千多名职工代表和模范先进人物，表示了他们今年一定要提前建成铁矿山、大型高炉、大型平炉、大型焦炉和其他一系列工程的决心，力争以最快的步伐投入为一千八百万吨钢而战斗的行列。
    会上，中共包钢党委第一书记陈守中、包钢总经理杨维宣布了包钢1959年的战斗计划。他们指出，包钢今年在基本建设方面，要完成六大厂矿的十多个重要工程项目；在生产方面，要力争大量出铁、出钢、出钢材。他们说，全国人民的大力支援，华北地区的积极援助，内蒙古和包头市全力以赴的支持，给了包钢职工很大的鼓舞。目前包钢全体职工的决心是：今年一定要过好“三关”（炼铁、炼钢、轧钢），决不辜负党和全国人民的期望。过好“三关”的关键在于基本建设，在于早日出铁。因此，上半年要以一号高炉工程为中心，以矿山、水源、炼焦、炼铁四条战线为重点，全面展开大战。
    施工、设计、后勤等各条战线和各厂矿的代表，都在会上表示了决心。施工和生产前线职工的决心是：苦战、实干、巧干，不完成任务不下火线。后勤工作职工的保证是：不怕千辛万苦，保证作好供应工作。
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会书记、包头市委第一书记苏谦益在会上讲了话。他要求包钢职工做好以下几件事：在展开“大战”和进攻“堡垒”之前，要检查一下战斗队伍和“武器弹药”；在克服困难中要贯彻两条腿走路的精神；领导干部要克服官僚主义，把干部参加劳动和种试验田经常化，把工作做得更细致更踏实；把去年技术革命的成果总结起来，把好的加以普遍推广。
    在誓师大会举行以前，包钢职工已经在各个工地上以更大的干劲展开了奋战。一号高炉已经安装到六十公尺以上。由工地领导干部、老工人和技术员组成的施工图纸检查小组，在日夜工作，他们要在高炉除尘洗涤系统的安装中，再次创造新纪录。白云鄂博铁矿山的工人，正在冰天雪地里施工和采矿。电气机车铁路铺轨工程已经进展到离主矿山不远了。水源地上职工们的战斗口号是：要跑在凌汛前面。
