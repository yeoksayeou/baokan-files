　　The loudspeaker on the wall of the Home of Respect for the Aged broadcast an emergency notice: “A cold wave is about to hit the local area.” Every word of the announcer was like a hammer, striking at the heart of “Grandpa Supervisor.”

　　“Grandpa Supervisor” was actually Grandpa Zhang. He loved to meddle in everything. For example, when the rice panicles in the commune were heavy and large, causing them to fall to the ground, he would manage everyone's chickens, fearing they would trample and peck at the rice; when there was a sultry thunder and rain, he would manage the kitchen, urging them to quickly boil ginger soup for the people who had returned from the rain. Because he managed so much, and managed it properly, like a head of the household, everyone called him "Grandpa Supervisor," but in fact, he didn't hold any position.

　　Now he was pacing around anxiously, muttering不停地念叨着: "It's just too coincidental, just when the cabbage is about to be harvested, the cold wave is coming. It’s just too coincidental, just when the young people have gone to the mountains to mine, the cold wave is coming."

　　The door burst open with a "kerplunk," and in came a girl of eighteen or nineteen. Her name was Huihui, and she was the receptionist at the Home of Respect for the Aged, bringing dinner. The girl was pretty and spoke pleasantly, but she was confronted by the "Supervisor." The old man said angrily: "Still eating? The cabbage is in trouble!" Perhaps the old man himself felt his tone was too harsh, so he calmed himself and said peacefully: "Little Hui, go see if the People's Liberation Army next door is there? We need to ask them for help."

　　"Is that what it is!" Huihui seemed relieved, took a breath, and shouted with a smile: "Eat, eat without worry! The People's Liberation Army is really proactive! They dropped the half-built stove a long time ago and rushed to the vegetable field. The trucks have also been dispatched."

　　"Ah… ah!" The old man was excited, moved a low stool, sat close to Huihui, and asked a series of questions, innocently watching Huihui answer. Huihui was afraid that the steaming noodles would get cold, so she picked out the most comforting things to say and answered in a string: "They all left, only a guard was left behind. The instructor led them running…" As she spoke, she casually moved the bowl of noodles closer to the old man. The old man saw Huihui's thoughts, picked up the noodles, and ate them. Suddenly he put down his chopsticks, looked around at everyone, and said: "Instructor Wang is also young, when the cold wave comes, it will be very cold, he should have kept someone to repair the stove! Otherwise, today we save the cabbage, and tomorrow people will freeze…." These words touched everyone, and even Huihui fell into thought.

　　After a long pause, "Grandpa Supervisor" suddenly stood up and walked outside, saying: "There's nothing to say, let's go build a stove for the soldiers!" Many people followed him.

　　The soldiers' dormitory was behind the Home of Respect for the Aged, not far from the cabbage field. Many gas lamps were set up in the vegetable field, and only shadows were seen running around in the light. The truck flashed two silver lights, roaring back and forth.

　　The old people stepped up the repair of the stove, wanting to complete it before the soldiers returned, so they would feel warm as soon as they entered the house. The most anxious, of course, was "Grandpa Supervisor." He asked Aunt Wang to heat water for washing feet, and Aunt Li to move bricks. He himself held a full basket of coal, but went back to the coal pile to add more, truly flustered. Fortunately, he ran into Grandpa Zhou at the door, and "Grandpa Supervisor" suddenly realized: "Look at me, so confused, how can I be dumping coal back!" This caused a burst of laughter in the room.

　　The north wind blew harder and harder, and the windows that weren't closed tightly rattled. The gas lamps in the vegetable field were taken down one by one, and it looked like the soldiers were coming back soon. "Grandpa Supervisor" took a large broom, sweeping the floor while yelling: "Quick, quickly add more to the stove. Make it clean and tidy, warm and cozy." Who in the room wasn't anxious? They had all sped up, covered in sweat.

　　The stove was burning furiously, the fire reflecting on the snow-white walls, illuminating the clean floor.

　　The lights were all turned on, the entire dormitory brightly lit. The lights seemed to understand the intentions of the old people, shining through the glass windows, illuminating the road for the soldiers' return.

    砌火炉和救白菜
    解放军驻齐齐哈尔某部　张弗松
    敬老院墙壁上的喇叭，响起了“寒潮即将袭击本地”的紧急通知。广播员的每一句话，都像一把锤子，声声敲在“总管大爷”的心肺上。
    “总管大爷”其实就是张大爷。他什么都爱管。比方，社里的水稻穗子结得又重又大，倒铺下地时，他就管起各家的鸡来，生怕它们去践踏，去啄食；天下了阵闷雷大雨时，他就管到炊事房，催促他们快烧姜汤给淋雨回来的人喝。因为他管得多，管得正当，像个当家，所以大家叫他“总管大爷”，事实上他并没有担负什么职务。
    现在他急得团团转，嘴里不停地念叨着：“偏偏这样巧，眼看白菜上手了，寒潮却也来了。偏偏这样巧，青年人都上山采矿去了，寒潮却来了。”
    门，“格蓬”一下被推开了，进来一个十八九岁的姑娘。她叫慧慧，是敬老院的招待员，送晚饭来了。姑娘长得秀气，说话引人欢喜，可是这遭儿被“总管”冲上了。只听得老人家气恼地说：“还吃饭？大白菜遭殃了！”大约老人家自己也觉得声气太粗了，静了静心，平和地说：“小慧，去看一下隔壁的解放军在不？得请他们帮忙了。”
    “为的是这个呀！”慧慧像是卸下了重担，舒了一口气，连说带笑地嚷着：“吃吧，放心吃吧！人家解放军可真主动啦！老早丢下砌得半拉的火炉，赶到菜地去了。大汽车也出动了。”
    “啊……啊！”老人家兴奋了，搬了一个矮凳，靠近慧慧坐下，提出一连串的问题，天真地瞅着慧慧回答。慧慧生怕热腾腾的面条冻凉，就拣了几个最能宽人心的事儿，连珠炮似的答了一阵：“统统走了，只留下个站岗的。指导员带着跑步去的……。”说着，随手把面条碗往老人家面前移了下。老人家看出了慧慧的心思，挑了挑面条，吃起来。忽地又放了筷子，眼睛向大家扫了一下，说：“王指导员也年轻，寒潮一来，天要大冷，该留人修火炉才对啊！要不，今朝救了白菜，明朝冻坏人……。”这番话触动了众人，连慧慧也跟着沉思起来了。
    停了半晌，“总管大爷”猛地站起来朝外走，说：“没啥可说的，咱们去给战士砌炉子去！”许多人跟着去了。
    战士的宿舍在敬老院的后面，离白菜地不远。菜地上支起许多盏汽灯，灯光中只见人影奔忙，汽车闪着两道银光，来回吼着。
    老人们加紧抢修火炉，要在战士回来之前修成，好让他们进屋就感到热烘烘的。最心急的当然是“总管大爷”了，他一时要王大婶烧洗脚水，一时又要李大娘搬砖头，他自己捧着一满畚箕的煤，却又往煤堆去添，真有些忙乱了。幸好到门口跟周大爷撞了个满怀，“总管大爷”才恍然地说：“看我这糊涂，怎么往回倒煤呢！”引得满屋子一片笑声。
    北风一阵猛过一阵，没关严实的窗门，吱呀吱呀直摇晃。菜地里汽灯一个一个摘下来了，眼看战士们快回来了。“总管大爷”拿一把大扫帚，一边扫地一边咤呼：“快，快把炉子加旺些。弄个清清爽爽，暖暖和和的。”满屋子人谁不急？早都加快了速度，满头大汗了。
    火炉呼呼地大燃了，炉火映红了雪白的墙壁，照着洁净的地面。
    电灯都打开了，整个宿舍通亮通亮的。灯光似乎也领会了老人们的心意，透过玻璃窗，照明了战士归来的大路。
