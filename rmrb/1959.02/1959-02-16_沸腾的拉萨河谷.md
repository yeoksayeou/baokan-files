Boiling Lhasa River Valley
By our correspondent Zong Zidu

	In the frigid winter, the usually tranquil Lhasa River Valley is today filled with the constant roar of explosions. Air compressors, bulldozers, and drilling machines roar day and night, and ten-wheeled trucks haul granite and dump it into the Lhasa River, creating splashes of water.... Thousands of People's Liberation Army soldiers and Tibetan laborers are building the largest hydroelectric power station on the Tibetan Plateau—the Lhasa River Hydroelectric Power Station—in the Lhasa River Valley, just over ten kilometers east of Lhasa.
    The construction of this hydroelectric power station is a monumental task, requiring the construction of a riverbank dam with a base of twenty-eight meters and a total length of over four thousand meters to cut off the surging Lhasa River. It also requires splitting the several-dozen-meter-high Gaba Mountain in half and clearing and transporting more than ten million cubic meters of solid rock and earth. Once completed this year, the Lhasa River Hydroelectric Power Station will generate more than 7,000 kilowatts of electricity.
    Since construction began partially last National Day, the Lhasa River Hydroelectric Power Station has progressed rapidly. A large gap has already been cut into Gaba Mountain, and the riverbank and dam have been built to a height of two to three meters. Most of the materials for constructing the factory buildings have also been transported to the construction site.
    Arriving at the Lhasa River Hydroelectric Power Station construction site, one can see from afar the large characters written on Gaba Mountain in white earth: "Split Mountains, Fill Rivers, Build Power Stations." Hundreds of tents are pitched on the river滩, resembling a new town. Next to the power station construction headquarters, a large pile of wood is stacked—these are the power poles for the high-voltage lines. Workers to erect the high-voltage lines have already set off from Beijing to Tibet.
    Red flags flutter on the construction site, and cars and people flow ceaselessly. The roar of machinery and the songs of labor make the Lhasa River Valley boil. Here, politics takes command, and technological innovation blossoms. Soil-carrying vehicles rumble over small railway tracks, and automatic soil-unloading vehicles dump a cubic meter of soil with a single pull of a tether. The builders are not only relying on their hands but also on their wisdom to build the Tibetan Plateau.
    "Make the high mountains bow their heads, make the rivers give way" was the heroic vow of the plateau warriors when building the Kangzang Highway. Now, four years have passed, and many of the old warriors have either been transferred or retired, and the new warriors have inherited this glorious tradition. They are engaged in selfless labor to build socialism and build a new Tibet. Soldiers whose terms of service have expired are requesting to serve beyond their time to continue building the power station.
    The mechanical unit is responsible for the key project of splitting Gaba Mountain and opening up the water inlet. This construction task must be completed before the Lhasa River floods rise this spring; otherwise, the rising floodwaters will destroy the dam, and the construction of the factory buildings will be affected. The officers and soldiers of the mechanical unit put forward the slogan "Race against the floods, strive for speed like rockets" and divided into three shifts, working day and night to launch a heroic struggle against Gaba Mountain.
    The scene of the officers and soldiers fighting at night on Gaba Mountain is deeply moving. Late at night, the cold wind cuts through Gaba Mountain like a sharp knife, stirring up blinding dust, and the construction lighting sways from side to side, and the light becomes dim. The cold is constantly attacking people. When the hoses of the air compressors freeze, everyone takes off their cotton coats to wrap them; when their hands freeze numb, they breathe on them and pick up their tools again. Under such circumstances, jackhammer operators and bulldozer operators often exceed their daily eight-hour construction quota.
    In the construction of the riverbank dam, the soldiers also demonstrated soaring enthusiasm. Communist Youth League member Hu Yinjin carried soil and stones, each load weighing more than a hundred pounds, running back and forth. His feet were blistered, and his hands were chapped, but he never let anyone replace him all day long.
    More than seven hundred Tibetan laborers are a powerful force in the construction of the hydroelectric power station. These Tibetan laborers come from all over Tibet, and many of them are veteran Tibetan laborers who have built the Kangzang Highway, airports, and the Lhasa Duodi River Power Plant. In December last year, when they heard the news that a large hydroelectric power station was being built on the Lhasa River, they automatically rushed from remote rural areas or pastures to participate in the construction.
    The construction site is filled with scenes of close unity between the Tibetan and Han nationalities and joyful labor together for a common goal. At first, Tibetan laborers did not know how to use rubber-wheeled carts to transport soil, so they had to carry it basket by basket. The soldiers carefully taught them, repeatedly demonstrating the movements to them. Now, Tibetan laborers on the construction site have generally learned to use rubber-wheeled carts to transport soil, reducing physical labor.
    In a recent shock week, the first squad of the first team of Tibetan laborers secretly slipped out of their tents before dawn to go to work, transporting more than seventy carts of soil in a single day, winning the red flag of excellence. The other labor teams are also catching up, and their work efficiency has increased more than twofold compared to when they first arrived.

   沸腾的拉萨河谷
   本报记者　宗子度
   在严寒的冬季里，一向宁静的拉萨河谷，今天却不断传出了爆破的轰鸣声。空气压缩机、推土机和钻探机日夜吼叫着，十轮卡车把花岗岩石运来抛入拉萨河中，激起了飞溅的浪花……。几千名进藏人民解放军和藏族民工正在拉萨市东郊十多公里的拉萨河谷里，修建西藏高原上目前最大的一座水电站——拉萨河水电站。
    这座水电站的修建工程是很艰巨的，必需筑起底宽二十八公尺，总长四千多公尺的顺河坝和拦河坝，把奔腾的拉萨河拦腰斩断，必须把几十公尺高的嘎巴山头劈成两半，还要清除和运送一千多万方的坚石和泥土。拉萨河水电站在今年全部建成之后，将发出七千多瓩的电力。
    从去年国庆节局部动工以来，拉萨河水电站的修建工程进展很快，嘎巴山头已被劈开了一个大缺口，顺河坝和拦河坝也筑起了两三公尺高，修建厂房的料具也已大部运来工地。
    来到拉萨河水电站工地，远远就会望见嘎巴山上用白土写成的几个大字：劈山填河修电站。河滩上搭着几百顶帐篷，很像一个新兴的集镇。在电站修建指挥部旁边，堆集着一大堆木料，这是高压线的电杆，架高压线的工人已从北京动身前来西藏。
    工地上红旗招展，汽车和人群川流不息，机器的吼声和劳动的歌声使拉萨河谷沸腾起来了。在这里，政治挂了帅，技术革新开了花。运土车隆隆滚过小铁轨，自动卸土车，一拉拴就卸完了一方土。建设者们不但凭双手，而且还凭着他们的智慧在建设西藏高原。
    “叫高山低头，叫河水让路”是高原战士们修筑康藏公路时的英雄誓言。如今，四个年头过去了，当年的老战士也大都转业或复员了，新战士们又继承了这一光荣的传统。他们为了建设社会主义，为了建设新西藏而进行着忘我的劳动。服役期满的战士们都要求超期服务，继续修建电站。
    机械部队担负着劈开嘎巴山，打通进水口的重点工程。这一施工任务一定要在今年春天，拉萨河洪水上涨以前完成，不然，上涨的洪水将冲毁拦河坝，厂房的修建也会受到影响。机械部队的官兵们提出了“跟洪水赛跑，乘火箭争先”的口号，分成三班，日夜不停地向嘎巴山头展开了英勇的奋战。
    官兵们夜战嘎巴山的情景是十分感人的。深夜，寒风像尖刀似的刮过嘎巴山头，掀起了迷眼的沙尘，施工照明用的电灯被刮得左右摇幌，光线也变得朦胧了，严寒随时在向人们进攻。空气压缩机的皮管上了冻，大家就脱下棉袄来包住它；手冻麻木了，放在嘴边哈哈气又拿起工具。在这样的情况下，风镐手和推土机手还常常超额完成白天八小时的施工定额。
    在修砌顺河坝的施工中，战士们同样发挥了冲天的干劲。共青团员胡银进挑土运石，一担就是一百多斤，来回跑着，脚上打了泡，手冻裂了，一整天也从不让别人替换。
    七百多名藏族民工是修建水电站的一支强大力量。这些藏族民工来自西藏各地，其中有许多人还是修筑过康藏公路、机场和拉萨夺底沟电厂的藏族老民工。去年12月里，当他们听到拉萨河上正在修筑一座大水电站的消息后，就自动从遥远的农村或牧场赶来参加施工。
    工地上充满了藏、汉民族亲密团结和为了共同目的一起愉快劳动的情景。起初，藏族民工们不会用胶轮车运土，要一筐一筐的背，战士们就细心的教他们，反复做示范动作给他们看。现在，工地上的藏族民工普遍学会了用胶轮车运土，减轻了体力劳动。
    在最近的一次突击周里，藏族民工一中队一小队天不亮就从帐篷里悄悄地溜出来上工，一天运土高达七十多车，夺得了优胜红旗。其它的几个民工中队也急起直追，工效都比刚来时提高了一倍多。
