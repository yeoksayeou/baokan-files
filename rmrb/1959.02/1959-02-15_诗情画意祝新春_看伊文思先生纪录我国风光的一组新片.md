    Poetic New Year Greetings
    ——Watching Mr. Ivens' Series of New Films Recording the Scenery of Our Country
    Gu Gong
    I enjoyed watching Mr. Ivens' series of short films: "Winter," "Early Spring," and "Spring Festival." What did I like about them? Well, this film was shot by a foreigner, but many of the scenes are very much like Chinese traditional paintings. For example, the people lassoing horses in the wind and snow, the little lambs circling around their mothers, the boats floating on the misty lake surface, the close-ups of a flower bud, a clump of green bamboo... Seeing these things immediately brings to mind our ink wash paintings. In addition, many other scenes evoke many Chinese folk songs. For example, the herds of horses on the pasture, the mud dredgers on Tai Lake, the shovels flying on the reservoir construction site, the local opera stage during the Spring Festival... Aren't these like little poems with our national style? This film has both the artistic conception of Chinese painting and the poetic feeling of Chinese poetry, coupled with music rich in Chinese characteristics, the clanging pipa, the melodious erhu, further enriching the artistic color of our people. This is not easy! It can be seen that Mr. Ivens has carefully observed our paintings, studied our poems, and learned our operas. Otherwise, how could he have captured the winter of Inner Mongolia with such vitality? Otherwise, how could he have captured the scenery of Tai Lake so beautifully? Otherwise, how could he have captured the Spring Festival in the rural areas of Jiangnan so jubilantly? ...
    Not imposing one's own set of ideas on the people of another country, and absorbing the wisdom of the people of another country and integrating it into one's own artistic works—this is truly the internationalist spirit in creation.
    Mr. Ivens' series of works fully expresses his sincere friendship and deep concern for the Chinese people. Otherwise, he would not have braved the cold of minus forty degrees to go to the pastures of Inner Mongolia; otherwise, he would not have rushed to the reservoir construction site to capture such fiery shots; otherwise, he would not have stepped into the kitchens of ordinary farmers to see how the women fried fish and made New Year's Eve dinner; otherwise, he would not have been so interested in watching the art of blowing sugar figurines, the firecrackers lit by children, and the performances of workers and little girls on the stage... In his hurried visits, he saw the depths of the Chinese people's hearts - diligence, bravery, and optimism. In the sound of the hooves of horses kicking through the snow, he foresaw the leap of the Chinese people; on the spring-tilled land, he could already hear the drums of the Great Leap Forward; in the laughter and noise of the children during the festival, he further understood the happiness of the Chinese people - this happiness is not only reflected in clothes and decorations, but fills everyone's expression, everyone's heart. Thus, the moving short film "Early Spring" was produced.
    1958 was a year of earth-shaking changes for the Chinese people, a year in which the Chinese people created thousands of miracles, and a year in which the Chinese people threw old calendars behind them. After such a year, when watching this film again, people may have such a wish: How great it would be if we could film our people's communes! How great it would be if we could film our nationwide steelmaking! How great it would be if we could film our grain satellites! How great it would be if we could film countless new inventions! How great it would be if we could... Yes, Mr. Ivens, in this series of short films, has only recorded the moment when our 1958 Great Leap Forward was about to begin; but I believe that when Mr. Ivens comes to China again, he will surely satisfy these wishes of ours. At that time, in his new films, he will surely record the Chinese people's more heroic strides and more uplifting songs.

    诗情画意祝新春
    ——看伊文思先生纪录我国风光的一组新片
    顾工
    看了伊文思先生拍摄的一组短片：“冬”“早春”“春节”，我很喜欢。喜欢什么呢？你看，这部片子是外国人拍的，可是里面有好多画面，却很像中国的国画。比如在风雪中套马的人啦，在母羊身边绕着的小羊羔啦，在雾蒙蒙的湖面上飘着的船只啦，一枝花苞、一丛青竹的特写啦，……一看到这些，就会使人联想起我国的水墨画。另外还有好多画面，会使人联想到许许多多中国的民歌。比如牧场上的马群、太湖上的挖泥船、水库工地上翻飞的铁铲、春节时的土戏台……这些不都像一首首很有我们民族风格的小诗吗？这部片子，既有中国的画意，又有中国的诗情，再配上富有中国特色的音乐，铮铮的琵琶，悠扬的胡琴，更加浓了我们人民艺术的色调。这很不容易啊！可以看出，伊文思先生是认真地观摩过我们的画；研读过我们的诗；学习过我们的戏的。要不然内蒙古的冬天，他怎能拍得这样生气勃勃？要不然太湖的风光，他怎能拍得这样美妙动人？要不然江南农村中的春节，他怎能拍得这样欢腾热烈？……
    不拿自己的一套，硬往另一个国家的人民的头上套；并且汲取另一个国家人民的智慧结晶，融进自己的艺术作品里，这真正是创作中的国际主义精神。
  伊文思先生的这一组作品，充分表露出他对中国人民真挚的友情，深刻的关切。不然他不会冒着零下四十度的寒冷，跑到内蒙古的牧场上去；不然他不会赶到水库工地上，去摄下那样火热的镜头；不然他不会走进普通农民的灶间，去看农妇们怎样煎鱼，怎样做年饭；不然他不会对吹糖人的手艺，对孩子们点响的爆竹，对台子上工人和小姑娘的表演，都那么有兴趣地注视……。他在匆忙地来去中，看到了中国人民的内心深处——勤劳、勇敢、乐观。在那踢雪前进的马蹄声中，他展望出中国人民的飞跃；在春耕的土地上，他已经听到大跃进的鼓点；在节日孩子们的笑声中、闹声中，他更体会出中国人民的幸福——这种幸福不只是表现在衣帽上，装扮上，而是充溢在每个人的表情里，每个人的心灵中。于是才产生了“早春”这一组动人的短片。
    1958年是中国人民翻江倒海的一年，是中国人民创造千万奇迹的一年，是中国人民把一份份陈旧的日历抛向脑后的一年。过完了这样的一年，再来看这部片子的时候，人们也许会产生这样的愿望：要是能把我们的人民公社拍上多好！要是能把我们的全民炼钢拍上多好！要是能把我们的粮食卫星拍上多好！要是能把无数新的发明拍上多好！要是能把……是的，伊文思先生在这组短片里，还只是记录了我们1958年的大跃进正待举步的时刻；但是我相信，伊文思先生再来中国时，一定会满足我们的这些愿望。那时，在他拍摄的新片里，一定会记下中国人民更豪迈的阔步，更昂扬的歌声。
