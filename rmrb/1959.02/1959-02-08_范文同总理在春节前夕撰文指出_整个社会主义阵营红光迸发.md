Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th: Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, published an article in "People's Daily" today (on the eve of the Spring Festival) stating that from the Elbe River to the East Sea, the entire socialist camp is bursting with red light.

The article said, "The spring of 1959 is a red spring. The red light of the 21st Congress of the CPSU and the Seven-Year Construction Plan is shining all over the earth. The bright red color has dyed red the land of 600 million people in the East, where socialist construction is boiling; the people's communes are like the rising sun, appearing with strong vitality." The article said that Soviet artificial satellites have dyed the earth and space red, and the fantasies of mankind for generations will become reality.

The article said that, however, as long as imperialism exists in the world, oppression, exploitation, and the crisis of war will exist. The enemy has no way out. And cannot hope for tomorrow, because tomorrow is ours. The more brutal the enemy, the higher and firmer the hatred and fighting spirit of the revolutionary people. The strength of the people of the world is invincible, and socialism will surely win.

Regarding the situation in North Vietnam, Pham Van Dong wrote that the movement of mutual aid and cooperation is rising vigorously, and farmers are determined to win victory on the agricultural production front, and the movement to improve enterprise management is also developing. He wrote that the enemy has become extremely barbaric, and the flame of hatred burning in our hearts is the flame of revolution, which is transformed into the determination to build a socialist North Vietnam and the determination to complete the national democratic revolution in South Vietnam.

    范文同总理在春节前夕撰文指出
    整个社会主义阵营红光迸发
    新华社河内7日电　越南民主共和国总理范文同今天（春节前夕）在“人民报”上发表文章说，从易比河到东海，整个社会主义阵营红光迸发。
    文章说，“1959年的春天是红色的春天，苏共第二十一次代表大会和七年建设计划的红光正在普照着大地。鲜红的颜色染红了东方六亿人口的地方，在那里，社会主义的建设正在沸腾；人民公社如同初升的太阳，以强大的生命力出现”。文章说，苏联人造卫星染红了地球和太空，人类多少世代以来的幻想也将成为事实。
    文章说，然而，世界上只要帝国主义还存在，那么压迫、剥削和战争危机就存在。敌人没有出路。也指望不了明天，因为明天是我们的。敌人越是残暴，革命的人们的仇恨和斗志也就越加高涨和坚定。世界人民的力量是无敌的，社会主义一定会取得胜利。
    关于越南北方的情况，范文同写道，变工合作运动正在风起云涌，农民坚决争取农业生产战线上的胜利，改进企业管理的运动也正在发展。他写道，敌人已经野蛮到了极点，而在我们心头燃烧的仇恨的火焰是革命的火焰，它化为坚决建设社会主义的越南北方和坚决完成南越的民族民主革命的意志。
