“The Commune is Ours, We are the Commune's”
	Xie Pingze
The laborers at the Yanbaodi Reservoir construction site in Hong'an County have launched a fervent upsurge of studying the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. On the evening of January 15th, I participated in a discussion meeting of the Zhang Zhengheng group from the Liangdao Brigade of the Jiansu Commune's water conservancy team.

	Zhang Jiayou spoke first, saying: "If you want me to talk, I'll say the people's commune is very good. Take the construction of the Shizichong Reservoir in 1957 and this time building the Yanbaodi Reservoir as examples. In 1957, when we went to Shizichong, everyone brought their own grain, oil, and salt. Now, when we come here, the commune and brigade bring it all to us. That's not all. Back then, we'd assign grain-deficient households to the construction site, which caused even more worry. They had to borrow from the east and scrounge from the west, and some couldn't get enough in time, so they had to stay at home. Now, with grain supplied, there's no such thing..."

	Before Old Zhang finished speaking, Xiong Youfa, in his early twenties, interjected, saying: "Back then, even when we were at Shizichong, our hearts were still at Liangdao. Because we were worried about lacking this and that at home, worried that the elderly and children wouldn't be taken care of. Now, meals are free, we don't have to worry about firewood, rice, oil, and salt at home, and the brigade has also set up nurseries and homes for the elderly, so there's no need to worry about the old and young. People asked me: 'Why are you working so hard at Yanbaodi this time?' I said: 'Because I don't have to worry about anything!'"

	I hurriedly asked: "What's the reason for this?"

	Little Xiong replied cheerfully: "The commune is ours, we are the commune's!"

	A surge of warmth instantly coursed through my body. I didn't have time to carefully savor just how much meaning was in those two sentences. Old Li, who had been silent for a long time, interrupted my thoughts and chimed in: "There's one more thing that hasn't been mentioned. Back in Shizichong, how many 'women's federation' members could you find with a gong? Today, here, you open your eyes and see female warriors pushing carts and compacting earth. If it weren't for eating in the canteen, where would so many come from?!"

	Chen Dinghe didn't speak until he did, and once he started, he didn't stop. He talked about Shizichong and Yanbaodi; and from the small cooperative not being able to afford tractors and build new villages, to the commune establishing itself and tractors driving to their bay, Wang Jifan, and before coming to the reservoir, he participated in the construction of the Jinsha Village new village project... The topic became increasingly broad, and the five people were all talking at once, endlessly discussing.

	Seeing that everyone was most interested in Shizichong and Yanbaodi, the group leader supplemented some information and then, in what was clearly a summary, said: "Going to Shizichong in 1957 can be said to have been full of difficulties, people and horses found it hard to move, our bodies were at the construction site, but our hearts were at home. This time? Everything is convenient, we leave whenever we want, and once we arrive, we are focused on building the reservoir."

    “公社是我们的，我们是公社的”　  
    谢平仄
    红安县烟宝地水库工地的民工们，掀起了学习党的八届六中全会决议的热潮，1月15日晚，我参加了建苏公社水利团两道大队张正亨小组的讨论会。
    张家友发言了，他说：“要我讲，就要讲人民公社好得很。拿1957年修狮子冲水库和这回修烟宝地水库来说吧，1957年去狮子冲，粮食油盐各人带；现在来这里，公社大队给我们一起捎来，这且不说。那时还有点把缺粮户，派到工地上，更是发了愁，要东借西凑，有的一时搞不到，就只得留在家里；现在，粮食供给，根本没有这回事……。”
    不等老张说完，二十出头的熊友发就插嘴说：“那时就是到了狮子冲，心还挂在两道。因为耽心屋里缺这缺那，耽心老人细伢没有人照料；现在，吃饭不要钱了，家里柴米油盐不用愁，大队还办了托儿所、敬老院，老小也用不着耽心了。人家问我：‘你这回在烟宝地为么事这样攅劲？’我说：百事不用耽心哩！”
    我赶忙追问：“这又是么原因？”
    小熊爽朗地回答说：“公社是我们的，我们是公社的哩！”
    一股热流顿时穿过我的全身，我来不及细嚼这两句话究竟有多少滋味？沉默了多时的老李打断了我的思路，抢着说：“还有一条没有谈到。往日在狮子冲，你打锣能找到几个‘妇联的’？今天在这里，睁眼就是女将推车打夯，不是吃食堂，那来这多的？！”
    陈定和不讲则已，一讲就是没有个停的，他从狮子冲谈到烟宝地；又从小社买不起拖拉机、修不起新村，谈到公社建立不久，拖拉机开到了他们的塆子王纪畈，自己来水库以前参加了修建金沙村新村的工程……。话题越扯越开，五个人你一言我一句，滔滔不绝地议论不休。
    小组长因见大家对狮子冲、烟宝地最感兴趣，他补充了一些情况以后，显然是带总结性的说：“1957年去狮子冲，可以说是困难重重，人马难行，身在工地，心在家中；这次呢？百事方便，说走就走，到了以后，一心修水库。”
