    Xinhua News Agency, 21st: At a telephone conference convened by the Ministry of Commerce on the 19th, commercial workers in many key cotton-producing provinces expressed their determination to seize the opportunity before the full arrival of spring plowing and production, and to organize another purchase upsurge, striving to victoriously complete the 1958 cotton, hemp, and tobacco purchase tasks.
    The meeting focused on discussing the issue of completing the 1958 cotton purchase task. The meeting believed that China's cotton production had achieved a bumper harvest in 1958, and cotton resources were quite abundant. In addition to the fact that more cotton had been purchased in the previous months than in any previous year, it was entirely possible to continue to complete the 1958 cotton purchase task. According to reports from various places, some of the people's communes still have cotton in stock that has not been sold due to insufficient processing; during last year's autumn harvest, due to labor shortages, the picking was rough, and there was still a considerable amount of cotton on the ground and on the cotton stalks that had not been picked clean. In Hebei Province, over the past month, more than 710,000 dan of unginned cotton have been collected through mass movements. In addition, thoroughly cleaning warehouses and quickly processing the cotton reserved by the communes for seeds can also yield a lot of cotton. Therefore, under the leadership of party and government at all levels, carefully arranging labor, and launching another crash picking and purchasing upsurge, it is possible to complete the annual purchase plan. At the meeting, the person in charge of the commercial departments in Hebei Province introduced to various places the province's experience in strengthening cotton purchasing work during this period. Under the personal supervision of the First Secretaries of the Party committees at all levels, mobilization meetings have now been held from the province to the people's communes and production teams, repeatedly explaining to cadres at all levels and the vast number of commune members the great significance of completing the cotton purchasing task to support industrial production, and a series of specific policies have been stipulated to encourage the masses to sell cotton. Commercial departments have added many purchasing stations and mobile purchasing groups to facilitate the sale of cotton by the masses. A mass upsurge of cotton picking and selling has now begun to take shape in Hebei Province, and it is expected that the purchasing task will be completed by the end of February or at the latest by mid-March.
    The Ministry of Commerce called on all localities to learn from and promote the experience of Hebei Province, and under the unified leadership of Party and government at all levels, to seize the time before spring plowing and launch another purchasing upsurge. When organizing the masses to pick cotton, the role of semi-labor forces should be fully utilized to pick up and collect all the cotton bolls on cotton stalks, the unopened bolls, the "eyelashes," the fallen cotton, the broken leaves and branch leaves of flue-cured tobacco. Appropriate reward methods can be stipulated for commune members who pick and collect cotton and hemp to encourage their enthusiasm. Commercial departments at all levels must concentrate their efforts to do a good job in purchasing, and come up with various methods to facilitate the masses in selling. In some places, purchasing units have gone deep into production teams to purchase the cotton that should be sold by the communes and teams but has not yet been sold, and organized mobile groups to go deep into the villages to purchase cotton scattered in the hands of commune members. These methods have been very effective and are worth promoting in various places. The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that in handling retained cotton, all localities must implement the spirit of thrift, encourage communes and commune members to retain less and sell more, and save more cotton to support national industrial production. The Ministry of Commerce also requires all localities to pay attention to simultaneously grasping purchasing, processing, and transfer, allocating necessary labor and animal power to transport unginned cotton, ensuring that processing plants do not stop work, and sending people at any time to inspect the production situation of processing plants and assist them in solving specific problems in their work. If some people's communes process and sell ginned cotton themselves, commercial departments should also help them quickly organize professional teams to start production.

    商业工作者，动员起来，突击收购、调运棉麻烟
    春耕前胜利完成收购任务
    据新华社21日讯　在商业部19日召开的电话会议上，许多重点产棉省的商业工作人员，表示决心在春耕生产全面到来以前，抓紧时机，再组织一次收购高潮，力争胜利地完成1958年度的棉花以及麻、烟收购任务。
    会议着重讨论了完成1958年度棉花收购任务问题，会议认为，1958年我国棉花生产获得了大丰收，棉花资源是相当丰富的，除去前几个月已经收购了比过去任何一年都多的棉花以外，继续完成1958年度的棉花收购任务是完全可能的。据各地反映，目前人民公社还有一部分库存棉因加工不及，尚未出售；去年秋收时因劳动力紧张，采摘粗糙，在地里、棉柴上都还有相当数量的棉花没有采摘干净。河北省一个多月来，通过群众运动，就多收籽棉七十一万多担。此外，彻底清理仓库和把公社留作种子的棉花迅速加工出来，都可以收到很多棉花。因此，在各级党政领导下，认真安排劳动力，再发动一次突击采摘收购高潮，就有可能完成全年度的收购计划。会上，河北省商业部门负责人向各地介绍了全省这一段时期加强棉花收购工作的经验。在各级党委第一书记亲自掌握下，目前从省到人民公社、生产队都层层召开了动员大会，对各级干部和广大社员反复讲清了完成棉花收购任务以支援工业生产的重大意义，又规定了一系列具体政策，鼓励群众售棉。商业部门增设了很多收购站和流动收购组，便于群众出售。现在一个群众性的摘棉、售棉高潮已开始在河北省形成，预计到2月底最迟3月半就可以完成收购任务。
    商业部号召各地学习和推广河北省的经验，在各级党政的统一领导下，抓紧春耕以前这一段时间，再掀起一个收购高潮。在组织群众采摘时，要充分发挥半劳动力的作用，把棉柴上的棉桃、僵瓣棉、“眼睫毛”、落地棉，烤烟的碎叶、杈叶，一律收摘和拣拾干净。对于摘拾棉、麻的社员，可以规定适当的奖励办法，鼓励他们的积极性。各级商业部门要集中力量做好收购工作，想出各种办法便利群众交售。有的地方的收购单位深入到生产队收购社、队应售未售的棉花，组织流动组深入到村收购分散在社员手中的棉花等办法，效果十分显著，值得各地推广。商业部指出，各地在处理留用棉时，一定要贯彻节约精神，鼓励公社和社员少留多卖，节约更多的棉花支援国家工业生产。商业部还要求各地要注意一手抓收购、一手抓加工和调运，配备必要的劳力和畜力运输籽棉，保证加工厂不停工，要随时派人检查加工厂的生产情况，协助他们解决工作中的具体问题。有的人民公社自行加工出售皮棉，商业部门也应该帮助他们迅速组织专业队伍开工生产。
