Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 8th: An advanced experience sowing team, composed of technical innovators like Liao Shigang, worker-designer Li Bingzhong, and young engineer Liu Zilin, has ignited the torch of technological revolution in many factories in Chongqing.

This advanced experience sowing team was organized by the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League. Since late January, they have visited Chongqing Air Compressor Factory, Chang'an Machinery Factory, Jialing Machinery Factory, and other units. At each factory, they promoted more than ten advanced technologies, such as high-speed cutting, mechanization of fitter work, and stamping, through on-site demonstrations and other methods, greatly boosting the morale of the workers. Previously, the cutting feed rate of workers in the third workshop of the Air Compressor Factory was generally only about 30 millimeters. Liao Shigang, an advanced producer from Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, first helped a worker with ordinary technical skills in this workshop to master the advanced experience of high-speed cutting, breaking the superstition that "ordinary workers cannot perform high-speed cutting." As a result, the workers in the third workshop generally increased the cutting speed and increased the feed rate to more than 100 millimeters. After learning Liao Shigang's experience, the workers of the fourth work section of this workshop changed the processing method of a workpiece from milling to stamping, and it is estimated that they will be able to complete the February production plan in just six days.

The members of the advanced experience sowing team not only promote advanced technologies but also use their own personal experiences to introduce their ideological leaps to the workers. After hearing Liao Shigang's report, more than 6,000 workers at the Air Compressor Factory, under the organization of the Party committee, launched a vigorous airing of views and debates, thoroughly breaking the idea that "the technological revolution has reached its peak." Everyone was in high spirits, and everyone revised their plans. In just two days, the workers of the entire factory contributed more than 11,000 suggestions, and they worked hard overnight to realize 733 innovation projects, including 23 projects that increased work efficiency by more than a thousand times.

The members of the sowing team also humbly learned the advanced experiences of various units. They learned advanced technologies such as hand shears for blanking and stamping automation in these factories, which greatly improved themselves.

### 点起工业技术革命火把  重庆组成先进经验播种队

    点起工业技术革命火把
    重庆组成先进经验播种队
    新华社重庆8日电　一支由技术革新者廖世刚、工人设计师李秉中、青年工程师刘子林等组成的先进经验播种队，在重庆市许多工厂点起了技术革命的火把。
    这支先进经验播种队是由共青团重庆市委组织的。他们自1月下旬以来，先后走遍了重庆空气压缩机厂、长安机器厂、嘉陵机器厂等单位。每到一个工厂，他们就通过现场表演等方法，推广高速切削、钳工机械化、冲压等十多项先进技术，大大地鼓舞职工们的干劲。空气压缩机厂三车间的工人原来切削进刀量一般只有三十公厘左右。重庆建设机床厂先进生产者廖世刚首先帮助这个车间的一个技术平常的工人掌握了高速切削的先进经验，打破了“一般工人不能高速切削”的迷信，结果三车间的工人们普遍提高了车速，将进刀量增大到一百公厘以上。这个车间四工段的工人们学习了廖世刚的经验后，将一种工作物的加工方法由铣改为冲压，预计只要六天的时间就可以完成2月份的生产计划。
    先进经验播种队的队员们不仅推广先进技术，还现身说法，用自己的亲身体会，向职工们介绍自己思想跃进的情况。空气压缩机厂六千多工人听到廖世刚的报告以后，在党委的组织下开展大鸣大放，大破“技术革命到顶”的思想，个个情绪高昂，个个修订规划，仅两天的时间，全厂工人就献计一万一千多条，并且连夜苦战，实现了七百三十三个革新项目，其中提高工效千倍以上的有二十三项。
    播种队队员们也十分虚心地学习各单位的先进经验。他们在这些厂学到了下料手剪机、冲压自动化等先进技术，大大提高了自己。
