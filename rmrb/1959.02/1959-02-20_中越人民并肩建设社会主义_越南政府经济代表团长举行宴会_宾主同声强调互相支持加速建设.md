Xinhua News Agency, February 19th: The head of the Vietnamese government economic delegation, Minister of Industry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Le Thanh Nghi, held a banquet tonight to celebrate the signing of seven documents related to economic cooperation between China and Vietnam.

	In his speech at the banquet, Comrade Le Thanh Nghi said: According to the signed documents, the trade volume between Vietnam and China this year will increase tenfold compared to 1954. China will also provide Vietnam with complete sets of equipment for 49 construction projects, as well as loans of 300 million RMB and grants of 100 million RMB. This clearly shows that the series of signed documents marks a new and important development in economic cooperation between Vietnam and China and in the brotherly friendship between the two peoples.

	Le Thanh Nghi said: “Vietnam and China are two members of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, sharing contiguous lands. The close friendship and fraternal cooperation between the two countries are based on Marxism-Leninism and the spirit of proletarian internationalist solidarity. On the common front against imperialism and building socialism, our two countries are comrades-in-arms fighting shoulder to shoulder, helping and supporting each other, and cooperating with each other in all aspects to achieve common goals. In recent years, this friendship and cooperation has developed even more vigorously.” Le Thanh Nghi said: “The Vietnamese people firmly believe that, due to their selfless labor, their arduous and long-term fighting will, and the sympathy and support of the Soviet Union, China, and the entire socialist camp, our socialist revolution and socialist construction will surely be successful. Our struggle for the unification of the motherland will surely be victorious.”

	Le Thanh Nghi concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people fully support the Chinese people in any struggle for building socialism, for liberating Taiwan, and for opposing all the evil conspiracies of U.S. imperialism, and congratulated the Chinese people on their greater achievements in socialist construction.

	He also expressed, on behalf of the Vietnamese people, the Vietnamese Labor Party, and the Vietnamese government, the most sincere gratitude for the fraternal sympathy and support of the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese government.

	Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke at the banquet. He said: China's help to the Vietnamese people is very small. The achievements made by the Vietnamese people in the past difficult years and in today's construction are the result of the Vietnamese people's own revolutionary struggle. The Chinese people greatly admire this.

	Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Vietnamese people, relying on their own efforts, will certainly be able to build Vietnam even better. China's slight help to the Vietnamese people is only secondary. In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi recalled that President Ho Chi Minh and other Vietnamese comrades had participated in the Chinese revolution, and that the Vietnamese Party and people had given the Chinese people help and support in various Chinese revolutionary struggles. Therefore, he said, when it comes to helping, we should first thank the Vietnamese Party and people for helping the Chinese people.

	Minister Ye Ji-zhuang also spoke at the banquet. He talked about the development of economic cooperation and trade relations between China and Vietnam in recent years. He said that the Vietnamese people stand on the forefront of the struggle against imperialism, and their arduous struggle against imperialism has made valuable contributions to world peace and the socialist cause. Helping the Vietnamese people is the responsibility of the Chinese people.

	Chinese guests invited to attend the banquet also included Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo, and Vice Ministers of Foreign Trade Lei Renmin and Li Qiang.

	Deputy Head of the Vietnamese Government Economic Delegation, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Li Ban, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of Vietnam in China, Pham Binh, and members of the Vietnamese Government Economic Delegation also attended the banquet.

    中越人民并肩建设社会主义
    越南政府经济代表团长举行宴会
    宾主同声强调互相支持加速建设
    新华社19日讯　越南政府经济代表团团长、越南民主共和国工业部部长黎清毅今晚为中越签订有关经济合作的七个文件举行宴会。
    黎清毅团长在宴会上首先讲话。他说：根据已经签订的文件，越中两国今年的贸易额和1954年比较将增长十倍。中国还将供给越南四十九个建设项目的成套设备，并且提供越南以三亿人民币的贷款和一亿人民币的无偿援助，这明显地说明了已经签订的一系列文件，是越中两国经济合作和两国人民的兄弟友谊的新的重要的发展。
    黎清毅说：“越南和中国是两个国土相连的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的成员。两国之间的亲切友谊和兄弟般的合作是建基于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义团结精神的基础上的。在反对帝国主义和建设社会主义的共同战线上，我们两国是并肩奋斗的战友，相互帮助、相互支持，在各方面彼此合作，以求达到共同目标，最近几年来，这种友谊和合作又愈加有力地发展着。”黎清毅说：“越南人民深信，由于自身的忘我劳动、坚苦的长期的奋斗意志；再加上苏联、中国和整个社会主义阵营的同情和支持，我们的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业必将取得成功。我们为祖国的统一而进行的斗争必将取得胜利。”
    黎清毅最后说，越南人民全力支持中国人民为建设社会主义，为解放台湾、为反对美帝国主义一切罪恶的阴谋而进行的任何斗争，并且祝贺中国人民在社会主义建设事业中获得更大的成就。
    他还代表越南人民、越南劳动党和越南政府对于中国人民、中国共产党和中国政府的兄弟般的同情和支持，表示最恳切的感谢。
    陈毅副总理在宴会上讲话。他说：中国对越南人民的帮助是很小的。越南人民在过去的艰苦岁月中和在今天的建设事业中所取得的成就，乃是越南人民自己革命奋斗的结果。中国人民非常钦佩。
    陈毅副总理说，越南人民依靠自己的努力，一定能把越南建设得更好。中国对越南人民的些微帮助仅处于次要地位。陈毅副总理在讲话中追述了胡志明主席和其他越南同志曾参加过中国革命，越南党和人民在历次中国革命斗争中给予中国人民的帮助和支持。因而他说，谈到帮助，应该首先感谢越南党和人民帮助了中国人民。
    叶季壮部长也在宴会上讲了话。他谈到了几年来中越两国经济合作和贸易关系的发展。他说，越南人民站在对帝国主义斗争的最前线，他们对帝国主义所进行的艰苦斗争，对于世界和平和社会主义事业有宝贵的贡献。帮助越南人民是中国人民的责任。
    中国方面应邀出席这次宴会的，还有外交部副部长罗贵波，对外贸易部副部长雷任民、李强。
    越南政府经济代表团副团长、越南民主共和国对外贸易部副部长李班，越南驻中国临时代办范平以及越南政府经济代表团的团员们也参加了宴会。
