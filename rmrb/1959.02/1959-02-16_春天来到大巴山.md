Spring Comes to the Daba Mountains
By our reporters Ji Xichen and Sun Yuedong

The prelude to the great leap forward in agricultural production has already begun in the old revolutionary base area of the Chuanxia Soviet in the Daba Mountains. Millions of farmers with a glorious revolutionary tradition are pushing forward a surging production upsurge with the heroic posture of fighting the enemy in those years.

The production outlook of the Daba Mountains, a region characterized by high mountains, thin land, barren soil, and impoverished people, has now been fundamentally changed. Last year, this area achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production. The grain output of many counties has increased several times, with a general yield of 800 to 900 jin per mu, and some exceeding 1,000 jin per mu, almost two to three times more than before liberation. People's lives have generally improved. Now, they are not only able to eat their fill and keep warm but also have surplus grain, so the farmers' production enthusiasm is universally high.

In order to strive for a greater harvest this year, the people of the old revolutionary base area have invested even greater revolutionary efforts in a large-scale production campaign centered on accumulating fertilizer, field management, and spring plowing preparations. Recently, Bazhong, Tongjiang, Nanjiang and other counties have all re-arranged their labor forces to ensure that 60%-70% of the labor force is engaged in fertilizer accumulation and field management; Friendly competitions have also been launched between counties, districts, and communes. Nanjiang and Wanyuan, Bashan and Dazhou, Tongjiang and Pingchang have all issued challenge letters. A competition centered on accumulating fertilizer has also begun between the ten districts of Tongjiang County. Urban residents, government cadres, and school students have also joined the vast number of farmers, carrying baskets, pushing carts, going up mountains and down to the fields, accumulating fertilizer, weeding, and deep plowing the land. Bazhong launched a campaign throughout the county of "one factory (local fertilizer factory) per team, one kiln (fumigation kiln) per mu, one pit (compost pit) per five mu, and 100,000 jin of fertilizer per person," accumulating 42.8 billion jin of various fertilizers in January, preparing more than 40,000 jin of fertilizer for each mu of spring-sown land.

In the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, farmers are generally carrying out spring plowing production activities one to two months earlier than in previous years. Pingchang and Bazhong counties have planted more than 10,000 mu of spring potatoes and deeply plowed more than 100,000 mu of cotton fields to a depth of one to one and a half chi. Bazhong County has plowed and harrowed 200,000 mu of rice seedling fields and transported fertilizer to the edge of the fields; Another 100,000 mu of high-yield rice fields have been deep-plowed and a base fertilizer of 50,000 jin per mu has been applied. Pingchang County has also thickened the soil layer on more than 17,000 mu of land, converted more than 1,600 mu of dry land into paddy fields, and improved more than 3,000 mu of soil by using methods such as mixing sandy soil with clay soil and mixing clay soil with sandy soil. In the high mountain areas of Wanyuan County, the Piwo People's Commune, despite the ubiquitous ice and snow, the members broke with convention and launched various production activities. They braved the wind and snow to climb the mountains and have now deep-plowed more than 130 mu of leisure land and accumulated more than 1 million jin of fertilizer. At the same time, they have top-dressed all 600 mu of wheat and 100 mu of rapeseed in the commune.

Although it is still early before spring planting and summer harvesting, the farmers here are actively preparing various tools for spring planting and summer harvesting. Bazhong, Nanjiang, Pingchang and other counties have set up training classes by district to manufacture and promote wheat harvesting, threshing, water lifting, and rice planting tools. Pingchang County has manufactured more than 100 rice transplanters and distributed them to various communes for imitation and promotion. Bazhong, Nanjiang and other counties are also stepping up the trial production of wheat harvesting machines and tools for manufacturing cotton nutrient pots. In many areas, the communes are also starting to prepare sweet potato hotbed seedling equipment in order to cultivate seedlings as early as possible and strive for early planting. (Attached picture)

    春天来到大巴山
    本报记者　纪希晨　孙跃冬
    农业生产大跃进的序幕已在大巴山区川峡苏维埃革命老根据地揭开。数百万有着光荣革命传统的农民，正以当年对敌斗争的英雄姿态，推起澎湃的生产高潮。
    山高地薄、地瘠人穷的大巴山区，生产面貌现已基本改变。去年，这一带农业生产获得空前大丰收。许多县的粮食产量都成倍的增加，一般亩产八、九百斤，有的超过一千斤以上，比解放前几乎增加二、三倍。人民生活普遍得到改善，现在不仅能吃饱穿暖，而且还有了余粮，因而农民生产情绪普遍高涨。
    为争取今年更大丰收，老根据地人民以更大革命干劲，投入以积肥造肥、田间管理、春耕准备为中心的大生产运动。最近，巴中、通江、南江等县，都重新对劳动力作了安排，保证有60％—70％的劳动力从事积肥造肥和田间管理工作；各县、区、公社之间还展开了友谊竞赛。南江和万源、巴山和达县、通江和平昌都下了挑战应战书，通江县十个区之间也都开始了以积肥为中心的竞赛。城镇居民、机关干部和学校学生，也都和广大农民一起，背着背篼、推着车子、上山下地，积肥、除草、深翻土地。巴中在全县开展“每队一厂（土化肥厂）、亩地一窑（熏肥窑）、五亩一坑（沤肥坑），一人十万斤肥”运动，在1月份内积各种肥料四百二十八亿斤，为每亩春播地准备好肥料四万多斤。
    在跃进高潮中，农民们普遍比往年提早一两个月进行春耕生产活动。平昌、巴中两县已种下春洋芋一万多亩，深耕棉地十万亩以上，一般一尺到一尺五。巴中县已将二十万亩水稻秧田犁耙好，并将肥料运到田边；另有十万亩水稻高产田，在深耕后施下底肥每亩五万斤。平昌县还将一万七千多亩土地加厚土层，旱地改成水田一千六百多亩，采用沙土掺粘土、粘土掺沙土等办法改良土壤三千多亩。万源县高山地区的皮窝人民公社，尽管冰雪遍地，但社员们打破惯例，展开各种生产活动。他们冒着风雪上山，现已深耕休闲地一百三十多亩，积肥一百多万斤，同时把全社六百多亩小麦和一百多亩油菜都进行了一次追肥。
    现在离春种夏收时间虽然还早，但这里的农民已在积极准备春种夏收的各种工具。巴中、南江、平昌等县，都以区为单位开办训练班，制造推广割麦、打场、提水、栽秧等工具。平昌县已制成水稻插秧机一百多部，发给各公社进行仿制推广。巴中、南江等县也在加紧试制割麦机和制造棉花营养钵的工具。许多地区的公社还在着手进行红苕的温床育苗设备，以便及早育苗，争取早栽。（附图片）
