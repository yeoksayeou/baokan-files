Urban and Rural People Fight for Fertilizer

“During the day, a sea of people; at night, a sea of lights.” This is how members of the Sumba Commune in Su County describe the fertilizer accumulation campaign. Everywhere there are songs and laughter, people are quickly carrying, pushing, and digging, fighting for fertilizer!

We strolled with Comrade Zhang Hong, the First Secretary of the Su County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in the urban area. On every street, cadres from government offices and residents were accumulating fertilizer, students were shouting cheerful slogans, competing to deliver fertilizer. More than two hundred residents of the Third Residents Committee, mostly middle-aged women and old men, were particularly serious about accumulating fertilizer. In the cold of the early morning, they picked out bricks and tiles from the fertilizer piece by piece, then carefully sieved the fertilizer. This fertilizer was even and fine, of good quality, and they accumulated about forty thousand catties of fertilizer every day. The residents of the Fourth Residents Committee cleaned out ditches that had not been dug for many years to accumulate fertilizer. Although digging the ditches was incredibly smelly, the residents did not dislike it; on the contrary, they worked very vigorously!

Students from the Second Department of the Su County Agricultural School braved the severe cold of minus six or seven degrees, breaking ice to dig Longgou to collect fertilizer. They sang "Socialism is Good" and shouted: "Feet may be frozen, sweat may flow, we vow not to rest until the fertilizer is on the bank." A dozen young teachers from Su County No. 2 Middle School delivered the fertilizer from the school to the fields on the very night they were assigned to arrange for fertilizer accumulation.

We didn't return until dark with Comrade Zhang Hong. The sounds of the Sumba Commune's urban and rural members' fertilizer accumulation slogans still rose and fell.

The next day, we went to the Sumba Brigade of the Sumba Commune. The cold wind was biting, but seeing the enthusiasm of the members in accumulating fertilizer made one not feel cold at all. There was a youth backbone team, mostly young lads who had graduated from primary school. From a li away, you could hear their songs and laughter. The day before, this team was rated as upstream in dismantling and replacing wall soil and stove soil, averaging more than seventeen cubic meters of fertilizer accumulated per person per day. In Chenying Village, we saw how many methods the masses had devised to tap fertilizer sources. They turned over the soil around the pigsty a foot deep. Yang Baotian dug a large amount of fertile soil in the front and back of a courtyard, and people described the soil in this courtyard as fertile as oily dregs.

The elderly were not lagging behind either, they formed elderly teams, each dressed warmly, voluntarily coming out to accumulate fertilizer. We asked: "Old grandpas, you're coming to accumulate fertilizer even on such a cold day?" An old man replied: "The wheat is growing well this year, we have energy to work!" An old grandpa unbuttoned his clothes, revealing a red cloth strip on the cotton-padded jacket underneath, which read "Upstream." This is what those who have achieved success in accumulating fertilizer can wear. Standing in front of these elderly fertilizer accumulation teams, it was like standing in front of a team of young people, they looked so young, happy, and competitive!

The labor songs of the Sumba Brigade gradually decreased after nine o'clock in the evening. At 9:30 PM, in the office of Chenying Village, the room was filled with team leaders who had just put down their dung baskets. The assessment of the fertilizer accumulation work began.

    城乡人民为肥而战
    “白天一片人，晚上一片灯。”这是宿县三八公社社员在积肥运动中的写照。到处歌声、笑声，人们飞快地担着、推着、挖着，他们在为肥料而战！
    我们和中共宿县县委第一书记张鸿同志，在城关漫步。每条街上，都有机关干部和居民在积肥，学生们喊着愉快的号子，争相送肥。第三居民委员会的二百多个居民，大半是中年妇女和老头，他们对待积肥特别认真。在早晨严寒里，他们把肥料中的砖瓦一块块拣出来，然后用筛仔细地筛着肥料。这些肥料又匀又细，质量很好，每天大约积四万多斤肥料。第四居民委员会的居民，把多少年没有挖过的阴沟掏清了积肥，挖阴沟虽然奇臭难闻，但是居民们并不嫌它，相反地干得很起劲哩！
    宿县农业学校二部的学生，冒着零下六、七度的严寒，破冰挖龙沟取肥。他们唱着“社会主义好”，喊着：“脚冻破，汗可流，肥不上岸誓不休”。宿县二中的十几个青年教师，在布置积肥的当晚，就把学校里的肥料送到地里。
    我们和张鸿同志到天黑时才回来，三八公社城乡社员积肥的号子声，仍然此伏彼起。
    第二天，我们到三八公社的三八大队去。寒风凛冽，但是看到社员们积肥的劲头，使人一点也不感到寒冷。有一个青年基干队，他们大都是高小毕业的青年小伙子，在一里地以外，就听到他们的歌声，笑声了。前一天在拆换墙土和灶土时，这个队被评为上游，每人一天平均积肥十七方多。在陈营村，我们看到群众想了多少办法在挖掘肥源。他们把猪圈周围的土翻了一尺深。杨宝田在一个院子的家前屋后，挖了大量的肥土，人们形容这个院里的土，肥得像油饼渣子。
    老年人也不落后，他们成立了老年队，个个穿得严严实实，自愿出来积肥。我们问：“老大爷，这么冷的天，你们也来积肥了？”一个老人回答说：“今年麦子长得好，干的有劲！”一个老大爷解开衣服，在里面的棉袄上露出了一个红布条，上面写着“上游”。这是积肥有成绩的人才能戴上的。我们站在这些老年积肥队的面前，像站在一队青年面前一样，他们显得多么年轻、快乐、好胜！
    三八大队的劳动歌声，到晚上九点钟以后才逐渐少起来。九时半，在陈营村的办公室里，屋子里坐满了刚放下粪筐的各个小队队长。积肥工作的评比开始了。
