Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 24th: Coal mines under the Jixi Mining Bureau in Heilongjiang Province are focusing on the weak links in high production to ensure a large increase in coal production from existing mines.

The Jixi Mining Bureau's coal production target for this year has been raised by another 55% based on last year's Great Leap Forward. Existing mines are expected to shoulder nearly 80% of the annual task. Therefore, how to unleash the production potential of existing mines is a key issue for increasing production this year. Based on the different conditions of each coal mine, the Mining Bureau has formulated three high-yield methods: some focus on increasing the cutting area, some combine appropriately increasing the cutting area with multiple cycles, and some focus on multiple cycle operations. These are all effective high-yield measures. In addition, they closely focus on four important aspects. First, changing the labor organization of the coal mining workface, forming a comprehensive work team consisting of workers from different jobs such as coal mining, drilling and blasting, coal transportation, moving the chute, and removing pillars and releasing the roof, to facilitate mutual cooperation and give play to collective strength. Second, when a high-yield workface appears, they try every means to tap the potential of transportation and hoisting equipment, so that underground transportation and hoisting capacity can keep up with the requirements of high production. Third, reduce and eliminate roof and mechanical and electrical accidents. Fourth, rationally arrange roadways and vigorously carry out rapid tunneling to prepare new workfaces for rapid coal mining as early as possible.

Currently, employees of various coal mines in Jixi are launching a high-yield Red Banner competition. Based on the characteristics of the large proportion of thin coal seams in the entire mining area, they have formulated five different competition indicators. A competition upsurge of everyone engaging in high production and everyone striving for Red Banners has emerged throughout the mine.

    要老矿井多产煤炭
    鸡西矿人人争红旗
    据新华社哈尔滨24日电　黑龙江省鸡西矿务局所属各煤矿狠抓高产中的薄弱环节，保证现有矿井大量增产煤炭。
    鸡西矿务局今年的煤炭生产任务，在去年大跃进的基础上又提高了55％。现有矿井几乎要担负全年任务的80％。因此，如何发挥现有矿井的生产潜力，是今年增产的一个关键问题。矿务局根据各煤矿的不同条件，订出了三种高产办法，有的以加大截盘为主，有的以适当加大截盘与多循环相结合，有的全力进行多循环作业。这些都是行之有效的高产措施。另外紧紧抓住四个重要环节。首先是改变采煤工作面的劳动组织，将采煤、打眼放炮、运煤、挪溜子、撤柱放顶等不同工种的工人组成一个综合工作队，便于互相配合，发挥集体力量。其次，当高产工作面出现后，又千方百计挖掘运输、提升设备潜力，使井下运输和提升能力跟上高产的要求。第三，减少和消灭顶板、机电事故。第四，合理布置巷道，大搞快速掘进，为快速采煤及早准备出新的工作面。
    目前鸡西各煤矿的职工正在展开高产红旗竞赛。他们根据全矿区薄煤层比重大的特点，订出了五种不同的竞赛指标。全矿出现了人人搞高产、个个争红旗的竞赛热潮。
