    “The Chinese and Soviet Peoples are Eternal Brothers”
     Soviet Film Director Ye. Jigan
    "The Chinese and Soviet Peoples are Eternal Brothers," this line of lyrics is so popular in the Soviet Union and China that I sometimes feel it is the creation of the people themselves. Using this sentence to express the essence of the relationship between our two great peoples could not be more profound or appropriate – we are brothers, and eternal brothers.
    Nine years ago, our two countries signed the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. This glorious day has been recorded in the history of the Chinese and Soviet peoples and has become our great festival. However, I believe that our friendship itself is much longer than this treaty.
    This friendship of ours will be depicted and extolled in the first feature film co-produced by the Soviet Union and China, "The Wind from the East."
    Chinese and Soviet filmmakers already have experience in co-producing films. "The Victory of the Chinese People," "Liberated China," and "Alma-Ata – Lanzhou" are all joint creations of Chinese and Soviet film artists. However, these are all documentaries. We feel very honored to be able to participate in the filming of the first feature film co-produced by China and the Soviet Union. In the credits of the future film, the names of our Chinese friends – screenwriter Lin Shan, director Gan Xuewei, photographer Bao Jie, actors Tian Fang, Ma Jingwu, etc. – will be listed alongside the names of Soviet filmmakers – playwright Kozhevnikov, photographer Kalchatoy, and my own.
    The film "The Wind from the East" is based on the story of the people in a hydroelectric power station construction area fighting against floods. All the people in this area – farmers, workers, and People's Liberation Army troops – rose up to fight the floods. Soviet experts working in China also joined the Chinese brothers in this battle.
    Two images – two builders, one Chinese and one Soviet, are the center of the film. These two builders are old comrades-in-arms from the Russian Civil War. Later, they studied together at the Moscow Military Academy; for a time, they even guarded the Council of People's Commissars together in the Kremlin. These two good friends met Lenin there, and Lenin talked to them about the friendship between the great peoples of the Soviet Union and China, and about the source of this deep friendship. This is one of the important scenes in our film.
    We Soviet filmmakers have been to China and studied the materials with our Chinese counterparts. We met with Chinese peasants – the prototypes of the heroes in our film. Together, we selected locations for outdoor shooting. At the premiere of the film "Prelude to the Revolution," we met with Comrade Zhou Enlai. He was very interested in the film "The Wind from the East," which we had just begun to shoot.
    We will never forget this meeting with Comrade Zhou Enlai.
    Now the filming is taking place in the studio of the Moscow Film Studio. We are simultaneously making two copies – a regular screen copy and a wide screen copy. We are working at a very fast pace in an atmosphere of mutual understanding.
    Soon, our creative team will be going to China. We Soviet filmmakers can't wait to see your great country again.
    Dear friends, see you again in a few days!

### “中苏人民是永久弟兄”

    “中苏人民是永久弟兄”
     苏联电影导演　叶·吉甘
    “中苏人民是永久弟兄”，这句歌词在苏联和中国是如此流行，有时我觉得它就是人民自己的创作。用这句话来表现我们两国伟大人民的关系的实质，可以说再深刻、再恰当也没有了——我们是弟兄，而且是永久弟兄。
    九年前，我们两国签订了友好同盟互助条约。这个光辉的日子已经载入苏中两国人民的历史，成为我们的伟大节日。然而，我以为，我们的友谊本身比这个条约还要悠长得多。
    我们的这种友谊，将在苏中两国合拍的第一部艺术片“风从东方来”里得到描写和歌颂。
    中苏电影工作者已经有了合作拍电影的经验。“中国人民的胜利”、“解放了的中国”、“阿拉木图—兰州”，都是中苏两国电影艺术家共同的创作。但是，这些都是纪录片。我们对于能够参加中苏合拍的第一部故事片的拍摄工作，感到十分荣幸。在未来的影片的字幕上，我们的中国朋友——编剧林杉，导演干学伟，摄影包杰，演员田方、马精武等人的名字将和苏联电影工作者——剧作家科热甫尼科夫，摄影卡尔查托依以及我自己的名字并列在一起。
    影片“风从东方来”是以一个水电站建设地区的人民与洪水进行斗争的故事为题材的。这地区的全体人民——农民、工人和人民解放军部队都奋起与洪水展开了搏斗。在中国工作的苏联专家也和中国兄弟们一起，投入这场战斗。
    两个形象——中国和苏联的两个建设者是影片的中心。这两个建设者是俄国国内战争时期的老战友。后来，他们一起在莫斯科军事学校学习；有一个时期，还在克里姆林宫一起守卫过人民委员会。这两个好朋友在那里同列宁见过面，列宁和他们谈过苏中两国伟大人民的友谊，谈过这一深厚友谊的源泉。这是我们影片中重要镜头之一。
    我们苏联电影工作者曾经到过中国，和中国同行们一起研究过材料，会见过中国农民——我们影片的主人公的原型，我们一起选择过外景拍摄地点。在首次放映影片“革命的前奏”时，我们会见了周恩来同志。他对我们刚刚开始摄制的影片“风从东方来”，感到极大的兴趣。
    我们永远不会忘记同周恩来同志这次会见。
    现在影片拍摄工作正在莫斯科制片厂的摄影棚里进行。我们同时摄制两种拷贝——普通银幕拷贝和宽银幕拷贝。我们在互相了解的气氛中，以极快的速度进行工作。
    不久，我们这创作集体就要前往中国。我们苏联电影工作者急不可待地想再次看到你们伟大的国家。
    亲爱的朋友们，过些日子我们再见吧！
