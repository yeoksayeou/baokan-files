The Spring Festival is coming, bringing with it a vibrant, blossoming spring. During the Spring Festival holiday, you'll certainly want to see some newly performed entertainment programs, relax and recharge, and build up more energy for even greater leaps forward in the coming year, right? Here, you will see a program of new plays and films being staged in the capital during the Spring Festival. Feel free to choose which play or film you'd like to see.

    Hundred Refinements Make Steel: Ai Wu's novel "Hundred Refinements Make Steel" has been adapted for the stage by the Beijing People's Art Theater. This was adapted and revised by the entire Fourth Team of the theater during last year's upsurge of nationwide steelmaking, with Jiao Juyin and Yu Shizhi being the main writers.

    The script basically preserves the look of the original work. The characters, plot, and the several thrilling scenes in the original, such as the tapping of the steel, the falling bricks from the furnace top, and the leaking of steel from the furnace bottom, are all reproduced on the stage. There have also been some cuts, namely the omission of the original's sabotage plot line, and instead the focus is on depicting the conflict between two attitudes within the working class in terms of labor, honor, and love. At the same time, it also reflects the struggle between the two leadership ideologies in industrial construction: whether to carry out mass movements on a large scale or to rely on a small number of experts.

    The Fire Star Guerrilla: This is a wide-screen color feature film produced by the Kiev Film Studio in the Soviet Union. The film recounts a true story from the Soviet Patriotic War. The flames of war are approaching the beautiful and quiet village of Krimka. The adults have all gone with the army, leaving behind only the elderly, women, and children. More than ten patriotic youths organized the "Fire Star Guerrilla" and, under the leadership of the Party's underground organization, fought against the enemy. The youths created so many immortal feats of arms: blowing up railways, destroying bridges, and rescuing prisoners... The invaders were thrown into a state of panic. However, because one member violated discipline and was exposed, the organization was finally discovered by the enemy. Except for the captain, Balfin, and a few others who broke through the encirclement, the other members dedicated their youth and lives to the motherland!

    Starting from Scratch: Alloys are indispensable materials for industries such as national defense, machinery, and telecommunications. The film "Starting from Scratch" details the process of building the Benxi Alloy Factory. This factory started with only one ladle, two pots, three molds, and four people. Without factory buildings, people produced in dilapidated temples; lacking equipment, they made it themselves. In this way, the factory was established and produced more than 270 kinds of high-quality alloys. The film can provide you with profound education and tremendous encouragement.

    Five Heroes of Langya Mountain: The heroic story of the Five Heroes of Langya Mountain has long been circulated among the people. The film recounts their heroic historical facts: A squad of the Eighth Route Army, in order to contain the enemy and cover the safe transfer of the masses, was led by the squad leader to hold firm on Langya Mountain and engage in a fierce battle with the Japanese invaders and puppet troops, repelling the enemy's attacks again and again. When the ammunition was exhausted, stones were also used as weapons. Finally, they destroyed their guns and jumped off the high cliff! Their heroic deeds, their images of loyalty and unyielding spirit, are forever engraved in our hearts.

    Private Deng Zhigao: A thin and clever young man, wearing a big red flower, joyfully enlisted in the army, this is the protagonist of the film Deng Zhigao. Deng Zhigao loves the motherland, loves the army, and loves his comrades; however, he is very stubborn and lacks strict organizational discipline. Therefore, after joining the army, although he did not commit any major mistakes, he constantly made minor ones. The leaders patiently educated him, and his comrades sincerely helped him. He gradually realized his shortcomings and was determined to be a good soldier who would never leave the collective. Through this humorous story, the film reflects the intense and joyful life of the People's Liberation Army and the equal and friendly relations between officers and soldiers.

    And Quiet Flows the Don (Part 3): Those who have seen Parts 1 and 2 of "And Quiet Flows the Don" must be eagerly awaiting the ending of Grigory and Aksinya. In Part 3, we see it. Grigory's hair is gray; the beautiful and seductive Aksinya also has wrinkles on her face. When the White Army in the Don region is defeated by the Red Army, Grigory, who is in the White Army, returns to the village and later joins the Fomin bandit gang. One dark night, he takes Aksinya to escape to the south. On the way, Aksinya is killed. After burying his lover, Grigory wanders in a foreign land... The old system has been destroyed, and the new system has been born and grown!

    Mei Lanfang's Stage Art and The Love Probe:
    These are two opera films. "Mei Lanfang's Stage Art" includes two plays: "The Drunken Concubine" and "Farewell My Concubine." Mr. Mei Lanfang's "lying fish" posture in "The Drunken Concubine," his sword dance in "Farewell My Concubine," and his beautiful singing are all superb, making them enjoyable to watch again and again. Yue opera "The Love Probe" tells the story of Wang Kui's betrayal of Guiying, which everyone is familiar with. Jiao Guiying and Wang Kui are played by the famous Yue opera actors Fu Quanxiang and Lu Jinhua, respectively.

    Two Dramas Adapted from "My Family": Comrade Tao Cheng's revolutionary memoir "My Family" is a good book with great educational significance and deeply touching. The images of revolutionary martyrs Ouyang Meisheng and Ouyang Li'an, etc., recorded in the book, are so vivid and lifelike in front of our eyes. Now, the China Children's Art Theater and the Beijing Experimental Drama Troupe have both adapted the story of this book into dramas and performed them. The China Children's Art Theater mainly performs for children, so the adapted drama also focuses on describing Li'an's (that is, Zhixiong in the play) revolutionary activities, highlighting the brilliant image of this red teenager.

    春节里你愿意看什么？
    春节携带着生机蓬勃、百花怒放的春天来临了。在春节休假期间，你一定愿意去看看新演出的文娱节目，休憩休憩，为来年的更大跃进蓄养更充沛的精力吧？在这里，你将看到首都春节上演的新戏新影片的节目单。你喜欢看哪一个戏或哪一部电影，不妨挑选挑选。
    百炼成钢　艾芜的小说“百炼成钢”由北京人民艺术剧院搬上了舞台。这是在去年全民炼钢的热潮中，由该院第四队的全体同志改编修整出来的，主要的执笔人是焦菊隐和于是之等。
    剧本基本上保存了原著的面貌，原著中的人物、情节以及打出钢口、炉顶掉砖、炉底漏钢等几个惊心动魄的场面，都再现在舞台上面了。也有些剪裁，这就是略去了原著中特务破坏的线索，而集中了笔墨描绘工人阶级内部在劳动、荣誉、爱情这三方面两种态度的冲突；同时，也把在工业建设中是大搞群众运动，还是依靠少数专家的两种领导思想的斗争，做了一些反映。
    火星游击队　这是苏联基辅电影制片厂摄制的宽银幕彩色故事片。影片记叙了苏联卫国战争中的一个真实的故事。战火迫近了美丽安静的村庄——克里木卡。成年人都跟着军队走了，只剩下老年人、妇女和孩子们。十多个爱国青年组织了“火星游击队”，在党的地下组织的领导下，和敌人展开了斗争。青年们创造出了那么多不朽的战迹：炸铁路，毁桥梁，拯救俘虏……侵略者被搞得惊慌失措。但是因为一个队员不遵守纪律，暴露了，最后组织终于被敌人发现。除了队长巴尔芬等几人突出重围外，其它队员们都为祖国献出了青春和生命！
    白手起家　合金是国防、机械、电讯等工业不可缺少的材料。影片“白手起家”详尽地反映了本溪合金厂建成的经过。这个工厂开始只有一把杓子，两口锅，三个模子，四个人。没有厂房，人们就在破庙里生产；缺乏设备，就自己动手制造。就这样，工厂办起来了，生产了二百七十多种优质合金。影片能使你受到深刻的教育和莫大的鼓舞。
    狼牙山五壮士　狼牙山五壮士的悲壮的故事长期以来在人民中传诵。影片记叙的就是他们壮烈的史实：八路军的一个班为了牵制敌人，掩护群众安全转移，班长带着四个战士固守在狼牙山上和日寇及伪军展开了激烈的战斗，一次又一次地击退了敌人的进攻。弹药尽了，石头也被当作武器。最后，他们毁坏了枪支，从高高的悬崖上跳了下去！他们英雄的事迹，他们忠节不屈的形象，永远铭刻在我们心头。
    列兵邓志高　一个精瘦伶俐的小伙子，戴着大红花，喜气洋洋地入伍了，这就是影片的主人公邓志高。邓志高热爱祖国，热爱部队，热爱同志；不过他的脾气很倔，又缺乏严密的组织性纪律性，因此入伍以后，虽然大错不犯，可是却小错不断。首长耐心地教育他，同志们真诚地帮助他，他逐渐认识到自己的缺点，一心要作一个永不脱离集体的好战士了。通过这个富有喜剧色彩的故事，影片反映了人民解放军紧张愉快的生活情景，和官兵之间的平等友爱的关系。
    静静的顿河　（第三部）：看过“静静的顿河”第一、二部的人，一定都迫切地希望看到葛利高里和婀克西妮娅的结局，在第三部中，我们看到了。葛利高里的头发花白了；美丽诱人的婀克西妮娅脸上也有皱纹了。当顿河地区的白军受到红军的打击节节败退时，在白军中的葛利高里回到了村中，后来又参加了佛明匪帮。一个漆黑的夜晚，他带着婀克西妮娅准备逃到南方去。途中，婀克西妮娅被打死了。埋葬了自己的爱人，葛利高里流落在异乡……旧的制度被摧毁了，新的制度已经诞生壮大！
    梅兰芳的舞台艺术和情探
    这是两部戏曲影片。“梅兰芳的舞台艺术”包括“贵妃醉酒”和“霸王别姬”两出戏。梅兰芳先生在“贵妃醉酒”中的卧鱼身段、“霸王别姬”中的舞剑，以及他的优美的歌唱，都是精彩绝伦的，使人百看不厌。越剧“情探”写的是大家都熟知的王魁负桂英的故事。敫桂英和王魁分别由著名越剧演员傅全香、陆锦花扮演。
    根据“我的一家”改编的两个话剧　陶承同志所写的革命回忆录“我的一家”是一部有极大教育意义的、感人至深的好书。书中记载的革命烈士欧阳梅生、欧阳立安等人的形象是那样真切的、栩栩如生的突现在我们眼前。现在中国儿童剧院和北京市实验话剧团都根据这本书的故事编成话剧上演。中国儿童剧院主要是给孩子们演出，因此改编的话剧中也着重描写了立安（即剧中的志雄）的革命活动，突出了这个红色少年的光辉的形象。
