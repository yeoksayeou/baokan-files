Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 27th. In order to achieve large-scale high-yield wheat production, all regions of Henan Province have universally established large-scale high-yield wheat plots. According to statistics, the total area of ​​high-yield wheat plots in the province currently reaches more than 20 million mu, accounting for 30% of the total wheat field area in the province. In advanced wheat production counties, the area of high-yield plots reaches 30% to 40% of the total wheat field area, and in some individual cases, it reaches 50%.

The work of vigorously developing high-yield wheat plots in various regions of Henan Province is a new development based on the vigorous development of experimental fields and high-yield fields last year. During the autumn wheat sowing last year, many regions established large-scale high-yield fields and planned high-yield plots according to natural conditions. Before the Spring Festival, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site wheat conference in Meng County and Yanshi, summarized and promoted the experience of advanced regions in vigorously developing large-scale high-yield plots. After the meeting, various regions universally carried out the joining and expansion of the original small high-yield plots and high-yield experimental fields. As a result, many large-scale high-yield plots of tens of thousands of mu, or even hundreds of thousands of mu, have emerged in various regions.

In order to ensure the realization of large-scale wheat yield increase, all regions have strengthened the leadership of this work in accordance with the requirements of "every road has a commander, every plot has a general, every piece has a soldier, and no point is missed." They have ensured that every level has dedicated personnel responsible and have established and improved the responsibility system. For large-scale or large-area high-yield plots, generally, the prefectural party committees and administrative offices directly control them, and special high-yield plot headquarters have been established to achieve fixed leadership, unified command, and a firm grip to the end. For example, each of the six larger high-yield plots in Luoyang Prefecture has a prefectural party committee secretary and member in command. The 170 high-yield plots in Xinxiang Prefecture are also specifically led by 55 county party committee secretaries and more than 200 county party committee members. In this work, various regions have also universally adopted the method of large plots encompassing small plots, dividing several small plots in the large plots, equipping them with strong labor and animal power, establishing professional teams according to the plots, and formulating operating procedures and acceptance systems according to the management methods of state-owned farms, thus making the wheat field management work meticulous and excellent.

In the past few months, due to the vigorous development of high-yield plots in various regions, cadres at all levels in areas with roughly the same production conditions have been able to better lead production in accordance with local conditions, and prepared conditions for creating more high-yield wheat bases. At the same time, through the work of high-yield plots, field production has also been promoted, and new upsurges in wheat field management have constantly emerged.

In order to ensure that high-yield plots can obtain higher yields, various regions have not only adopted a set of scientific management systems for the management of high-yield plots, but also universally carried out mass agricultural scientific research, such as establishing wheat field archive systems and wheat experimental farms, and conducting various comparative tests on wheat growth. In this work, many regions have achieved having an experimental farm in every commune, a research group in every team, and a field experimental research office in every plot. Under the influence of vigorously developing high-yield plots, all communes in Hua County have established wheat field archives for 800,000 mu of wheat fields. The "August 1st" Agricultural Science Research Institute of Chengguan People's Commune in Meng County also conducted ten kinds of experiments on soil, seeds, fertilizers, close planting, and watering, and identified 490 excellent varieties.

After the establishment of large-scale high-yield plots in various regions, due to meticulous scientific management, the wheat fields in the high-yield plots have basically reached the standards of leveled ground, straight ridges, fine soil, and abundant fertilizer and water. As a result, wheat seedlings are now growing particularly vigorously, with the number of wheat seedlings per mu generally reaching about 500,000 to 600,000, and more reaching 800,000 to more than one million. The yield target per mu is more than double the local planned yield, and generally strives to reach more than 3,000 jin to 5,000 jin.

People's Daily, Hefei, 27th. Anhui Province is using the method of cultivating large-scale high-yield fields to drive general fields, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest of summer crops. This year, the province has planted nearly 50 million mu of summer crops. Now, whether it is large-scale high-yield fields or general fields, crops are growing better than in any previous year. In order to achieve a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, various regions have vigorously strengthened field management. At present, 110,000 field management professional teams have been established and improved in various regions of the province, with a total of more than 2.56 million people participating in the battle.

Since the sowing season last year, various regions in Anhui Province have launched a campaign to cultivate large-scale high-yield fields. The area of ​​large-scale high-yield fields determined for cultivation in the province accounts for 30% to 50% of the sown area of ​​summer crops, and the required yield per mu is more than double that of general fields. The first secretaries of party committees at all levels personally took command and strengthened the leadership of large-scale high-yield fields. People's communes in various regions have established professional teams and technical research groups, implementing the combination of leadership, technology, and the masses. Deep plowing and careful cultivation have been fully implemented in large-scale high-yield fields, achieving no clods on the ground and ditches in the fields. Generally, they are plowed to a depth of about one chi, applying more than 2,000 dan of base fertilizer per mu, sowing about 50 jin per mu, and adopting wide-row close planting, implementing professional management. Now, topdressing has been carried out in a timely manner, and most have been topdressed twice, with a topdressing amount of 400-500 dan per mu, and vigorous irrigation and ditch clearing and drainage work have been carried out.

Recently, general field crops have also closely followed the high-yield fields, advancing towards a comprehensive bumper harvest. In Lai'an County, in the county's wheat fields, large plots, small plots, and every plot of wheat fields are used to set an example with high-yield fields first, so that general fields closely follow the example. As a result, the quality of all 350,000 mu of wheat fields in the county has been better than in any previous year since sowing. So far, all 350,000 mu of wheat fields in the county have been topdressed once, and wheat field management work with topdressing as the main task is continuing.

Various regions, in conjunction with the comprehensive inspection and evaluation of wheat field management, have vigorously promoted the management experience of high-yield fields. The Suixi County Party Committee recently organized a large number of cadres from the county, townships, and communes. In a thorough inspection of each mound in the fields, the county universally established and improved field management professional teams, established a responsibility system, ensuring that every plot is responsible and every piece is managed. The county's 1.75 million mu of summer crops quickly and universally received two topdressings, and the wheat seedlings grew to achieve full and vigorous seedlings.

At present, in the struggle for a wheat yield of 1,000 jin per mu across the province, the masses are full of vigor and soaring enthusiasm. Party organizations at all levels in the province are seizing this opportunity and striking while the iron is hot. The Fuyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China recently established a wheat thousand-jin command, with First Secretary of the Prefectural Committee Ren Songjun as the commander. In Lai'an County of Bengbu Prefecture, in addition to the County Party Committee establishing a wheat thousand-jin campaign headquarters, six members of the County Party Committee were transferred to the communes to serve as first secretaries of the Party Committee, strengthening leadership on the front lines. Recently, due to continuous overcast and rainy weather, a maximum of 8 million people in the province carried out a blitz to clear ridge ditches and drain accumulated water, ensuring that the fields are dry after rain and there is no standing water in the ditches. They also made advance preparations for the drainage and irrigation system, digging ditches and repairing canals, preparing for irrigation during the wheat jointing and heading stages to meet needs. Various regions have also strengthened the prediction and forecasting of disastrous weather and pests and diseases, preventing various natural disasters as early as possible. The implementation of these new and powerful measures has played a major role in promoting the first battle of agricultural production. (Attached picture)

    抓住火候　趁热打铁　麦不收割　管理不停
    力争大片丰产方块块高产
    河南安徽在30％以上耕地上大搞丰产方，进行精心的科学管理
    新华社郑州27日电　河南省各地为实现小麦大面积高额丰产，普遍建立了小麦大面积丰产方。据统计，目前全省小麦丰产方面积共达二千多万亩，占全省麦田总面积的30％，小麦生产先进县的丰产方面积达到麦田总面积的30％到40％，个别的达到50％。
    河南省各地大搞小麦丰产方的工作是去年大搞试验田和高产田的新发展，在去秋小麦播种时，不少地区建立了大面积丰产田，并且根据自然条件规划了丰产方。春节前，中共河南省委在孟县、偃师召开的小麦现场会议上，总结和推广了先进地区大搞大面积丰产方的经验，会后各地对原有的小片丰产方和高产试验田又普遍进行了连片并方和扩大，因而，各地都出现了许多数万亩，甚至几十万亩连片的大面积丰产方。
    为了保证实现小麦大面积增产，各地都根据“路路有帅、方方有将、块块有兵、点点不漏”的要求，加强了对这一工作的领导。做到了层层有专人负责，并且建立和健全了责任制。各地对连片或面积较大的丰产方，一般都由各个地委和专署直接掌握，并且都建立了专门的丰产方指挥部，做到固定领导、统一指挥、一抓到底。例如洛阳专区的六个面积较大的丰产方，每方都有一个地委书记和委员挂帅，新乡专区的一百七十个丰产方也分别由五十五个县委书记和二百多县委委员具体领导。各地在这一工作中，还普遍采取了大方套小方的方法，在大方中划分若干小方，配备较强的劳动力和畜力，按方建立专业队，并且按照国营农场的管理方法，制订了操作规程和验收制度，因而使麦田管理工作做得又细又好。
    几个月来，由于各地大搞丰产方，使各级干部生产条件大体相同的地区，能够更好地因地制宜地来领导生产，并且为创造更多的小麦高产基地准备条件，同时，通过丰产方的工作，还带动了大田生产，不断出现麦田管理工作的新高潮。
    为确保丰产方能够获得更高的产量，各地不仅在丰产方的管理上采取了一套科学的管理制度，而且还普遍开展了群众性的农业科学研究工作，例如建立麦田档案制和小麦试验场，进行小麦生长的各种对比试验等，许多地区在这项工作中都做到了社社有试验场，队队有研究组，方方都有田间试验研究室。滑县的各个公社在大搞丰产方的影响下，全县有八十万亩麦田建立了麦田档案。孟县城关人民公社“八一”农业科学研究所还进行了土壤、种子、肥料、密植与浇水等十种试验，鉴定了四百九十个优良品种。
    各地在建立了大面积丰产方以后，由于进行了精心的科学管理，使丰产方的麦田都基本上达到了地平、埂直、土细和肥大水足的园田化的标准，因而现在麦苗生长特别健旺，一般每亩麦苗株数达五十到六十万株左右，多的达到八十到一百万株以上，每亩产量指标高出当地计划产量的一倍以上，一般都争取要达到三千斤到五千斤以上。
    本报合肥27日电　安徽省正以培养大面积高额丰产田带动一般田的办法，争取夏收作物全面丰收。全省今年夏收作物共种植了近五千万亩，现在不论是大面积高额丰产田，或是一般田，作物比以往任何一年都生长得好。为了实现亩产千斤，各地大力加强了田间管理。现在，全省各地已建立和健全了田间管理专业队十一万个，共计有二百五十六万多人投入了战斗。
    安徽省各地从去年播种开始，就开展了培养大面积高额丰产田运动。全省确定培养的大面积高额丰产田的面积，占夏收作物播种面积30％到50％，要求高过一般田的亩产量一倍以上。各级党委第一书记都亲自挂帅，加强对大面积高额丰产田的领导。各地人民公社都成立了专业队和技术研究小组，实行了领导、技术、群众三结合。在大面积高额丰产田上都全面实行了深耕细作，做到了地无坷垃，田有沟畦，一般都深耕在一尺左右，每亩施基肥在二千多担，每亩播种量在五十斤左右，并采取宽幅密植，实行专业管理。现在又及时地进行了追肥，大部分已追肥两遍，每亩追肥量在四、五百担，并大力进行了灌溉和清沟沥水工作。
    近来，各地的一般田作物也紧紧跟上丰产田，向全面丰产前进。来安县在全县麦田中，采用大片、小片、片片麦田以丰产田先做出榜样，使一般田照着榜样紧紧跟上。这样做的结果，全县三十五万亩麦田，从播种开始，质量比以往任何一年都好，到目前为止，全县三十五万亩麦田已全部追了一遍肥，并在继续开展以追肥为主的麦田管理工作。
    各地结合麦田管理的全面检查和评比，大力推广丰产田的管理经验。睢溪县委最近从县、乡、社组织大批干部，在深入田头逐丘检查中，全县普遍建立和健全了田间管理专业队，建立了责任制，做到片片有人负责，块块有人管理，全县一百七十五万亩夏收作物很快普遍地追了两遍肥，麦苗生长达到了苗全苗旺。
    现在，全省各地区在力争小麦亩产千斤的奋斗目标下，广大群众意气风发，干劲冲天。全省各级党组织正抓住这个火候，趁热打铁。中共阜阳地委最近成立了小麦千斤指挥部，由地委第一书记任松筠任指挥。蚌埠专区的来安县除县委成立小麦千斤运动指挥部外，并抽调六个中共县委委员下放到公社担任党委第一书记，加强第一线的领导。最近时期，连续阴雨，全省最多时有八百万人突击进行清理畦沟，排除积水，做到雨过田干，沟无积水。并预先做好排灌系统，挖沟修渠，准备在小麦拔节、孕穗期间进行灌溉，满足需要。各地还加强了对灾害性天气和病虫害预测预报工作，及早防治各种自然灾害。这些新的有力措施的实行，对打好农业生产第一仗起了重大促进作用。（附图片）
