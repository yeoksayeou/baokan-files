	On the morning of January 30th, just as the sky was beginning to lighten, and the ground was covered with a layer of white frost, commune members from the villages surrounding Hengjing Town were carrying baskets and shoulder poles, going to the market to buy their favorite goods, preparing to joyfully celebrate the Spring Festival.
	Hengjing Town is the commercial center of Hengjing Commune in Zhenze County, Jiangsu Province. This day happened to be a holiday, and there were more people on the streets than usual. I spent a day there conducting interviews and witnessed the prosperous scene of this ordinary lakeside town in the Taihu Lake area after the establishment of the people's commune.
	In front of the glass counters of the municipal industrial daily necessities and cotton cloth store, customers were packed. The salespersons were diligently and amiably selecting and introducing goods for the customers, extremely busy. Young commune members Wu Genlin and his wife carefully picked and chose, finally cutting two zhang and three chi of flower-patterned serge and nylon checkered cloth. Wu Genlin's wife planned to dress herself and her children beautifully for the Spring Festival. Wu Genlin told the reporter that his family had few laborers and many people. After the commune was established, a distribution system combining wages and supply was implemented. Not only was food free, but he had also recently received more than fifty yuan in wages. He truly had no worries about food and clothing.
	Commune member Qian Ada and her husband Zhu Sanmao came to the knitwear counter, bought a undershirt, and spent more than twenty yuan to buy seven chi of cloth and one jin and four liang of wool yarn. According to people familiar with Qian Ada, she used to be busy with housework all day at home and rarely participated in agricultural labor. Sometimes, if she wanted to buy a few chi of cloth, she had to use a lot of persuasion before her husband would give her the money. After the commune was established, there were public canteens, kindergartens, and nurseries, which freed her from tedious housework. She worked in the fields alongside the men and received the same wages. Recently, the couple received a total of more than seventy yuan in cash. Today, they came to the market together to buy daily necessities. Not only did her husband not say anything, but he also bought pencils, pens, and literacy textbooks, planning to teach his wife to read at night.
	The non-staple food store was also bustling. Many commune members were carrying baskets to buy food. Female commune member Lu Jinlan bought one jin of soy sauce and one jin of pickles. Salesperson Jin Xiuying asked her: "Are you cooking the New Year's Eve dinner yourself?" Lu Jinlan said, "I originally wanted to eat the New Year's Eve dinner with everyone in the canteen, but recently, because my mother-in-law has difficulty walking, the commune cadres showed concern for us and gave us grain, firewood, meat, fish, and New Year cakes, asking me to cook the New Year's Eve dinner at home."
	Many commune members also bought firecrackers in the sundries store. They wanted to joyfully set off firecrackers during the Spring Festival to celebrate last year's bumper harvest and welcome an even greater leap forward this year. When I visited the candy and preserved fruit processing factory in town, the factory director Wu Ruiyan introduced to me that the factory's supply of processed candies and pastries for the Spring Festival this year had increased by more than 30% compared to last year; the varieties had increased from fifteen last year to twenty-seven.
	In the store selling means of production, there were many customers selecting tools for preparing for spring plowing. A salesperson said: "People here all know that 'when the oil is sufficient, the lamp shines brightly, and when there is plenty of milk, the child is chubby; if fertilizer is piled up like a mountain, the yield per mu will be ten thousand jin,' so this year the store sells particularly many fertilizer accumulation tools."
	Hengjing Commune's agricultural and sideline production doubled last year, and industrial production also developed rapidly. The average personal income of commune members increased by 40% compared to 1957. People's material and cultural lives have both improved compared to last year. Late at night, the commune's auditorium was brightly lit. The sounds of the erhu, pipa, and Shaoxing opera were melodious and pleasant. It turned out that the commune's cultural troupe was working hard to rehearse programs to be performed during the Spring Festival.

    春节前的横泾镇
    新华社记者　周哲生
    1月30日清晨，天空刚刚露出一片亮光，大地上满铺着一层白霜，横泾镇周围村庄的社员们就提篮挑担，上市赶集选购心爱的商品，准备欢渡春节。
    横泾镇是江苏震泽县横泾公社的商业中心。这天恰好是假日，上街的人比平日增多。我在那里作了一天的访问，看到了这个太湖湖畔普通集镇在人民公社化后的繁荣景象。
    市镇工业日用品、棉布门市部的玻璃柜台前，站满了顾客。营业员殷勤和蔼地为顾客一面挑选，一面介绍，忙得不可开交。青年社员吴根林夫妇两个挑了又挑，选了又选，最后剪了两丈三尺花哔叽和尼龙格布，吴根林的爱人准备把自己和孩子打扮得漂漂亮亮过春节。吴根林对记者说：他家里劳力少人口多，公社成立后实行了工资制和供给制相结合的分配制度，不但吃饭不要钱，最近还领到了五十多元工资，真是吃穿都不愁了。
    社员钱阿大和丈夫朱三毛来到针织品柜前，买了一件卫生衫，又花二十多元买了七尺布和一斤四两毛线。据熟悉钱阿大的人说：钱阿大过去在家里成天忙家务，很少参加农业劳动，有时想买几尺布料，要费许多唇舌，丈夫才给钱。公社成立后，有了公共食堂、幼儿园、托儿所，使她摆脱了繁琐的家务劳动，和男人们一道下田干活，一样领工资。最近夫妇两人共领到现金七十多元。今天一同上街购买生活用品。她的丈夫不但没有说什么，还买了铅笔、钢笔和识字课本，计划在晚上教妻子识字。
    副食品商店也很热闹。许多社员提着篮子在那里购买食品。女社员陆金兰买了一斤酱油、一斤小菜，营业员金秀英问她：自己烧年饭哪？陆金兰说：“我本来想跟大家一起在食堂吃年饭，最近因为婆婆走路不方便，社干部关心我们，发给了粮食、柴草、肉、鱼和年糕，要我在家里做年饭吃。”
    很多社员还在南货店里买了爆竹，他们要在春节兴高彩烈地大放鞭炮，庆祝去年的丰收和迎接今年更大的跃进。当我到镇上的糖果、茶食加工厂参观时，厂长吴瑞炎向我介绍：工厂今年为春节供应加工的糖果、糕点，比去年增加30％以上；品种由去年的十五种增加到二十七种。
    在出售生产资料的门市部，有大批顾客在选购备耕工具。营业员说：这里人们都知道“油足灯光亮奶多孩子胖；肥料积如山，亩收万斤粮”，所以今年门市部出售的积肥工具特别多。
    横泾公社去年农副业生产翻了一番，工业生产也迅速发展，社员个人收入平均比1957年增加40％。人们的物质生活和文化生活都比去年提高。夜深了，公社大礼堂里灯火通明，胡琴声、琵琶声加上锡剧声，悠扬悦耳，原来是公社的文工团在加紧排练准备在春节演出的节目。
