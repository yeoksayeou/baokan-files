Grasp the Key Points, Innovate Technology, Daily Inspection, Ten-Day Evaluation
Shijingshan Steel Workers' Enthusiasm Grows Stronger

(Our Dispatch) Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company workers, on the basis of exceeding the January production and construction plan and the steel tasks for the first and middle ten days of February, put forward the fighting program of "More, Faster, Better, and More Economical, overall Great Leap Forward, breaking through six major barriers, doubling all indicators." Now, a massive mass movement to implement measures is unfolding throughout the company, and a new atmosphere has emerged in production.

The company's basic construction and production tasks this year will increase several times compared to last year, and this year marks the peak installation year of the first phase of the expansion project. Due to the introduction of a large number of new equipment and the exertion of the potential of existing equipment, the production tasks for steel and steel products have greatly increased compared to last year.

Based on summarizing the rich experience of last year, the company's workers carefully analyzed the production and construction situation this year and proposed to overcome the six major barriers of technology, transportation, materials and equipment, labor, production preparation, and quality and safety. Recently, the company's Party committee arranged this year's basic construction projects and construction sequence, and determined that in the first quarter, efforts should be concentrated on accelerating the construction of Blast Furnace No. 3, Coke Oven No. 3, and the sintering plant, striving to complete these three projects ahead of schedule. Company leaders personally took charge, leading the key project headquarters, and concentrated the company's repair and processing forces to invest in the installation of the three projects and rush-produce 1,700 tons of non-standard equipment. Since mid-February, the company's Party committee and administration have established a system of daily inspection of plan completion and ten-day evaluations. The sections, teams, and groups of each engineering company and production plant have established a system of daily and shift-by-shift inspection of plan completion and weekly and daily evaluations. On the basis of three comprehensive mass mobilizations since the beginning of this year, the enthusiasm of all employees in the company has grown stronger and stronger, focusing on discussing the annual plan and concentrating efforts to vigorously carry out technical measures to improve indicators.

The workers in the basic construction department, after conducting a mass quality inspection, are concentrating their superior forces to speed up the construction of the three projects of Blast Furnace No. 3, Coke Oven No. 3, and the sintering plant. On the premise of ensuring quality, they have adopted the methods of three-dimensional cross-flow operation and rapid installation of large components. They put forward the fighting slogan of "Rather let people wait for equipment than let equipment wait for people." The ironmaking workers in the production department are trying every means to improve the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace. They promoted the advanced experience of smelting small batches of materials, which greatly improved the utilization of gas in the furnace. In order to create conditions for increasing pig iron production and saving coke for the blast furnace, the workers of the hot blast stove of Blast Furnace No. 1 took measures such as adjusting gas, and on February 7, raised the air temperature to 1,100 degrees Celsius. These measures increased the blast furnace production level by 11.8% in the first and middle ten days of February compared with the same period in January. The average daily increase in iron production was 155 tons. In order to break through the raw material barrier and reverse the tight coke situation, the entire company launched a coke seizing battle. All workers and cadres set aside one day per week in February to participate in coke making, and 43 indigenous coke ovens have now been built. The workers of the coking plant took effective measures to tap production potential and realized 159 measures such as mud and coal flotation. The transportation department, aiming at key problems, mobilized the masses and put forward 389 improvement measures. Each section and team also launched a competition to "compare speed, compare quality, and compare effectiveness" in implementing measures. With the heroic struggle of the transportation department's workers and the assistance of various departments, the company's transportation and loading and unloading volume in the first half of February increased by 38.26% compared with the same period in January.

    抓紧重点　革新技术　每日检查　十天评比
    石钢职工干劲越鼓越足
    本报讯　石景山钢铁公司职工在超额完成1月份生产建设计划和2月上旬、中旬钢铁任务的基础上，提出了“多快又好省，全面大跃进，突破六大关，指标都翻番”的奋斗纲领，现在全公司展开了规模浩大的大搞措施的群众运动，生产上出现一片新气象。
    这个公司今年的基本建设和生产任务都将比去年有成倍的增长，今年进入了第一期扩建工程的高峰安装年度。由于大批新设备投入生产和发挥原有设备潜力，钢铁、钢材的生产任务都比去年有很大增加。
    这个公司的职工在总结去年丰富经验的基础上，认真分析了今年的生产建设形势，提出要过好技术、运输、材料设备、劳动力、生产准备和质量安全等六大关。最近，公司党委安排了今年的基本建设项目和施工顺序，确定第一季度集中力量加速三高炉、三焦炉和烧结厂的建设，力争这三项工程提前建成。公司领导亲自挂帅，领导重点工程指挥部，集中全公司的修理加工力量投入三个工程的安装和赶制一千七百吨非标准设备。公司党委和行政从2月中旬起建立了按日检查计划完成情况和十日一评比的制度，各工程公司和生产厂的段队班组，都建立了按日按班按组检查计划完成情况和按周按日评比的制度。全公司职工在今年以来三次全面大发动的基础上，干劲越鼓越足，围绕讨论全年计划，集中力量大搞提高指标的技术措施。
    基本建设部门的职工，在进行了一次群众性质量检查的基础上，正集中优势力量加紧建设三高炉、三焦炉和烧结厂三项工程，在保证质量的前提下，采取了立体交叉流水作业和大部件安装快速施工方法，他们提出了“宁让人等设备，不让设备等人”的战斗口号。生产部门的炼铁工人，正在千方百计提高高炉利用系数，他们推行了小料批冶炼的先进经验，大大改进了炉内煤气的利用。为给高炉增产生铁和节约焦炭创造条件，一高炉热风炉工人采取了调节煤气等措施后，在2月7日把风温提高到一千一百度。这些措施使2月上旬，中旬高炉生产水平比1月份同期提高了11.8％。平均每日增产铁一百五十五吨，为了突破原料关，扭转焦炭紧张局面，全公司展开了一个夺焦大战，全部学工和干部在2月里每周抽出一天参加炼焦，现已建成土焦炉四十三座。焦化厂职工采取有效措施，挖掘生产潜力，实现了泥煤浮选等一百五十九项措施。运输部针对关键问题，发动群众提出了三百八十九项改进措施。各段队并掀起了“比速度、比质量、比效果”的实现措施的竞赛。在运输部职工的英勇奋战和各部门的协助下，全公司2月上半月运输装卸量比1月同期提高38.26％。
