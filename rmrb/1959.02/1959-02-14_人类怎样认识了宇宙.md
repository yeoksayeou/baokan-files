    How Humanity Came to Know the Universe
    Xi Zezong
          Geocentric Theory
    The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, the moon waxes and wanes; the brilliant day, the mysterious starry sky; spring, summer, autumn, and winter, heat and cold come and go. What is the reason for these dazzling and varied phenomena? Since ancient times, our ancestors have made many guesses and fantasies, trying to answer these questions. Some ancient people believed that the world was like a large circular room, the floor of which was the land we live on, and the walls and ceiling were space. The saying "heaven is round and earth is square" also prevailed in ancient China for a long time. According to this saying, the sky rotates with the North Star in the center, while the earth is stationary.
    The ancient Chinese, Egyptians, and Babylonians, who were mainly engaged in agriculture, determined the seasons for sowing and harvesting by observing celestial phenomena, which promoted human understanding of the universe. Later, the Greek people on the Balkan Peninsula, in their voyages to trade with Egypt and occupy fertile immigrant lands, learned to determine routes and directions based on the stars and the moon, which also greatly developed astronomy.
    Greek astronomers synthesized many observations and created a naive materialist view of the universe. They were the first to put forward excellent conjectures about the infinity of the universe, the unity of the material world, the earth being a sphere and in motion, and that there is more than one living world. For example, Heraclitus (530-470 BC) said: "The whole world is unified, neither god nor man created it; whether in the past, present, or future, it is an eternal fire, burning regularly and extinguishing regularly." Another example is Aristarchus (late fourth century BC - first half of the third century BC) who believed that the earth has two kinds of motion: revolution around the sun and rotation around its axis.
    In addition, Greek scientists also put forward an idea that was very important in the development of astronomy, that is: the earth is a sphere suspended in space. Pythagoras (c. 571-497 BC) said: The earth, the sun, the moon, and the five planets are all spherical, suspended in space without supports; the earth is their center. Later, Eudoxus (c. 408-355 BC) developed this geocentric theory. He conceived a rather complex model of the universe with twenty-seven hypothetical spheres and made choices about the direction and speed of rotation of these spheres, as well as the inclination of the axis of rotation.
    Then, Aristotle (384-322 BC) improved Eudoxus's model of the universe. He increased the number of rotating spheres from twenty-seven to fifty-six and placed a "prime mover" outside the large sphere, as if it were guiding the movement of all the spheres.
    Later, Apollonius (c. 200 BC) used circles instead of spheres to explain planetary motion. He believed that each planet moved in a circle, and the center of this circle moved in a circle around the earth. Apollonius called the circle of planetary motion the epicycle, and the circle of the epicycle's center the deferent. After the speeds of the two wheels were selected, the planetary positions, which were fairly accurate at the time, could be calculated. The epicycle-deferent theory was later studied and perfected by Ptolemy (first half of the second century AD). He summarized all the astronomical knowledge of his predecessors and wrote the thirteen-volume "Almagest." This book was almost the bible of Western astronomers before the sixteenth century. The "Chongzhen New Calendar Book" of the Ming Dynasty in China also translated its outline.
    Regarding the understanding of the rotation of the sky and the movement of the earth, there were also fragmented records in China as early as the end of the Western Han Dynasty. "Spring and Autumn Weft" "Yuanmingbao" says: "The sky rotates to the left, and the earth moves to the right." "Kao Lingyao" says: "The earth is constantly moving, like a person sitting in a boat, the boat moving but the person not feeling it." However, these correct conjectures were not developed. Almost at the same time as Ptolemy, a rare genius appeared in China, and that was Zhang Heng (78-139 AD), who advocated the Hun Tian theory. Zhang Heng advocated that "the sky is round like a bullet, and the earth is like the yolk of an egg, isolated inside"; "the celestial body is yang, so it is round and moves; the terrestrial body is yin, so it is flat and still." Before the adoption of Western methods in the late Ming Dynasty, the theoretical basis of the calculation methods used in calendars in China was this Hun Tian theory.
            A New View of the Universe
    The development of commerce and navigation required more accurate measurement of time and methods for determining the position of ships on the vast ocean, so the untrue geocentric theory had no place to stand. Thus, as the bourgeoisie drove the feudal aristocracy from their ruling position, a new view of the universe emerged: the Earth was no longer considered the center of the universe, but just one of the planets orbiting the Sun.
    This remarkable discovery was completed by the great Polish scientist Copernicus (1473-1543) in the first half of the sixteenth century. Copernicus's "De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium" was a revolutionary work. Once this theory spread, it immediately aroused the animosity of the church, which considered it heresy and strictly prohibited it.
    But prohibition could not stop the development of science. Then, the famous scientists Bruno (1548-1600) and Galileo (1564-1642) made brilliant developments to Copernicus's theory. Bruno believed that the universe is infinite; stars are huge celestial bodies; the sun is just one of the stars, not the center of the universe; there may be planets like Earth around the stars, and there may be creatures like humans on them. Galileo used his own invented telescope to discover the mountains on the moon and the facts of sunspots on the sun, refuting the religious nonsense of "perfect celestial bodies" and "sinful earth." With the example of Jupiter and its four satellites orbiting the sun, he completely defeated the fallacy that "since the moon orbits the earth, it is impossible to orbit the sun together with the earth."
    This courageous challenge to religious superstition by Bruno and Galileo aroused the deep animosity of the church and suffered cruel persecution. Bruno was imprisoned for eight years and then burned to death in the Campo de' Fiori in Rome on February 17, 1600. Galileo, after being tried by the Inquisition, had to spend his old age trembling. However, the truth will always triumph; astronomical discoveries supporting Copernicus's theory appeared one after another.
    Kepler (1571-1630) corrected Copernicus's theory that the orbits of planets were circular and proposed that the orbits of celestial bodies were elliptical, creating the so-called "Kepler's First Law." At the same time, he also discovered that planets move faster when they are closer to the sun and slower when they are farther away from the sun, and determined "Kepler's Second Law." Following Copernicus's observation that planets farther from the sun have longer orbital periods, he discovered that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the planet's distance from the sun, and proposed the famous "Kepler's Third Law." The discovery of Kepler's three laws fundamentally overturned Ptolemy's epicycle-deferent theory and advanced Copernicus's cosmology. These three laws can be said to have become the constitution of planetary motion, and Soviet artificial planets are no exception to it.
    Although Kepler determined the geometric characteristics of planetary orbits, what was the physical cause of this motion? Why do planets orbit the sun along a certain orbit instead of flying away? These questions remained unanswered. It was not until Newton (1642-1727) derived the law of universal gravitation based on observational data and the laws of planetary motion that these questions were answered.
    Newton not only used his discovery of the law of universal gravitation to analyze in detail the motion of planets, the moon, and all objects on the ground, but also calculated the first cosmic velocity of 8 kilometers per second and the second cosmic velocity of 11.2 kilometers per second. However, since the fastest means of transportation at that time was only a horse-drawn carriage, Newton did not expect that humans would have the ability to fly into the sky.
    After Newton, there was the great Russian scholar Lomonosov (1711-1765). In a series of his works, he defended and developed the Copernican theory. In 1761, he observed a relatively rare phenomenon, that is: Venus moving in orbit around the Sun passed between the Sun and the Earth. Through this observation, he found that Venus was surrounded by a thick atmosphere. This proved that Venus was similar to Earth, thereby giving strong support to the Copernican theory.
            The Formation of Celestial Bodies
    Lomonosov not only firmly supported the Copernican theory, but also established the idea of ​​universal evolution of the material universe. He said: "The visible things seen on the earth and the entire universe did not begin in the state we find them today, but have undergone tremendous changes." This opened a gap in the then popular metaphysical view of nature. The prevailing view in the scientific community in the second half of the seventeenth century and the first half of the eighteenth century was that planets move along unchanging elliptical orbits, and will be like this now in the past or in the future.
    Kant (in 1755) and Laplace (in 1796)'s nebular hypothesis played a major role in opposing this view. According to the nebular hypothesis, the solar system began as a rotating cloud of gas. Due to its own cooling and contraction, the speed of rotation gradually increased. Under the action of centrifugal force at the equator of the nebula, some matter split from the sun and formed planets. The remaining central substance contracted into the sun.
    However, new characteristics of the solar system were constantly discovered later, and these characteristics conflicted with Laplace's hypothesis. For example, some satellites and comets rotate in the opposite direction. In particular, if planets were formed according to the nebular hypothesis, the sun and the planets should each maintain the same amount of angular momentum as before the nebula separated into rings; that is, the greater the mass, the faster the rotation. But in fact, the planets, whose total mass only accounts for a few thousandths of the sun's mass, retain more than 98% of the total angular momentum of the solar system.
    Faced with this serious difficulty, bourgeois astronomers, due to their class limitations and methodological errors, were helpless. Only Soviet scholars armed with dialectical materialism put forward a more reasonable plan, which is the Schmidt theory. Academician Schmidt believes that the sun, in its early stages of formation, or when it was moving around the center of the Milky Way, passed through a cloud of dust and captured a part of it. This dust contained particles of all sizes. Under the influence of the sun's gravity, the particles moved in certain orbits and collided with each other, and then stuck together, eventually forming planets. In the process of collision, there is an averaging effect, so the larger the mass of the planet, the rounder the orbit, and the more the orbital plane coincides with the equatorial plane of the sun. In the region near the sun, due to the high temperature, many particles evaporated, so the mass of Mercury and Venus is relatively small; in the region far from the sun, the amount of things captured was originally small, so Pluto is also small; only the region where Jupiter and Saturn are located is moderate, so two particularly large planets were formed. Schmidt also assumed that the sun originally did not rotate, but only began to rotate after the captured dust fell on it and brought angular momentum, so its angular momentum is very small.
          There are Heavens Beyond Heavens
    The study of stars outside the solar system did not have a major development until the mid-nineteenth century. Before that, astronomers' main interests were limited to the study of the solar system. Only Herschel (1738-1822) and Struve (1793-1864) had put forward some ideas about the structure of the Milky Way and the measurement of stellar distances.
    In the mid-nineteenth century, due to the development of physics, the method of spectral analysis was produced. By analyzing the light emitted from the stars, the chemical composition and physical state (temperature, density, pressure, etc.) of the stars can be studied, the speed of the stars can be measured, and many other properties of celestial bodies can be studied. By the 1920s of this century, astronomy used the achievements of atomic physics to infer the internal structure and energy sources of stars from the observed surface phenomena. After World War II, due to the development of radio technology, it supplemented the shortcomings of optical observation methods. Spectral analysis has revealed to mankind the diversity of cosmic matter. People have seen supernovae with brightness suddenly increasing by hundreds of millions of times, pulsating stars that periodically expand and contract, binary stars that come in pairs, clustered stars that come in groups of three or five, and star clusters composed of hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of stars. There is the "Pillar One Star" with a diameter 2,100 times that of the Sun, and the "Van Maanen's Star" with a diameter as small as 3/1000 of the Sun. There are white dwarfs with a density as high as 36 million times that of water, and red giants with a density as thin as almost a vacuum. There are early-type stars with a surface temperature as high as 80,000 degrees, and late-type stars with only 2,000 degrees.
    Through these complex phenomena, astronomers have also discovered many internal connections. For example, in 1900 it was discovered that stars can be divided into ten categories, that is, ten "spectral types," according to the characteristics of the spectrum, and there are connections between the various types. In 1913, Russell obtained an extremely important relationship when studying the spectral type of a star and its true luminosity (expressed in "absolute magnitude"), that is, the "luminosity-spectrum diagram," also known as the "Russell diagram." On the luminosity-spectrum diagram, most stars are located on a diagonal line from the upper left corner to the lower right corner, which is called the "main sequence"; giant stars and supergiants are in the upper right of the diagonal line, and white dwarfs are in the lower right of the diagonal line.
    After the discovery of the Russell diagram, people speculated that this diagram must represent an evolutionary connection, but there was no scientific basis. It was not until 1947, when Soviet astronomer Ambartsumian discovered stellar associations, that people realized that stars are still constantly forming in the Milky Way, and newly formed stars enter the main sequence from the entire line of the main sequence, and then evolve along the main sequence from the upper left corner to the lower right corner. This discovery by Ambartsumian dealt a fatal blow to the idealistic view that stars were "created at the same time" and the Western European fallacy that "stars are produced from nothing," showing the invincible revolutionary and scientific nature of dialectical materialism.
            Knowledge is Endless
    The stars we see with our naked eyes all belong to the Milky Way. There are now about 150 billion stars in the Milky Way. The sun is also in this Milky Way, but not in the center, about 23,500 light-years away from the center (one light-year is equal to 10 trillion kilometers). The sun and its planets together rotate around the center of the Milky Way at a high speed of 250 kilometers per second, but it still takes 180 million years to complete a circle. The size of the Milky Way can be seen from this.
    However, the Milky Way is not equal to the universe. There are galaxies outside the Milky Way, which are called "extragalactic galaxies" or "galaxies." The study of extragalactic galaxies has just begun, but there have been many discoveries. For example, each galaxy is like the Milky Way, with various types of stars; there are also groups of galaxies in groups of three or five; there seems to be an evolutionary connection between various types of galaxies.
    Bourgeois astronomers often use Einstein's theory of relativity to imagine that the universe is finite, but observations with new astronomical instruments have broken through the boundaries they imagined time and time again. For example, in 1927, British astronomer Jeans believed that the boundary of the universe seemed to be 4 million light-years away from us; but less than two years later, in 1929, telescopes saw extragalactic galaxies 140 million light-years away from us. Now the world's largest telescope can already see extragalactic galaxies 500 million light-years away from us. And, it has been discovered that within this spherical universe with a radius of 500 million light-years, there are more than 100 million extragalactic galaxies. It can be seen from this that there are even more extragalactic galaxies outside this range.
    Faced with this continuous expansion of the scope of human understanding of the universe and the continuous discovery of new things, bourgeois scientists appear so weak and powerless and feel that the future is茫茫. Jeans said: "Astronomy can never come to a conclusion in its own research, the only conclusion it has come to is that nothing is reliable in the universe." Singer, professor of the history of science at the University of London in England, also said when summarizing the scientific achievements of the past 100 years (1850-1950): "If you think that science is to explore the secrets of the universe and know the laws of nature, then the result of the hard work in the past 100 years is: our universe is unknowable and self-contradictory." Confined to their metaphysical and agnostic epistemological viewpoints, bourgeois scholars have lost confidence in mankind's ability to understand the world and in the future of scientific development! We dialectical materialists are full of confidence in mankind's ability to understand and full of confidence in scientific development. We believe that the universe is infinite, and mankind's ability to understand the universe is also infinite. "The limits of our knowledge approaching the objective and absolute truth are conditioned historically, but the existence of this truth is unconditional, and our approach to it is also unconditional." (Lenin: "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism") "There is nothing in the world that cannot be known, only things that are not yet known, but will be revealed and known by science and practice in the future" (Stalin, "Dialectical and Historical Materialism"). Isn't it true that Soviet space rockets have already flown into the sky, the era of interstellar travel is coming, and the scope of the solar system has become the boundary of geography. Future astronomical observations on Mercury and Pluto will obtain a lot of new information; and once the photon rocket is successful, interstellar travel will reveal even more cosmic secrets.

    人类怎样认识了宇宙
    席泽宗
          地球中心说
    太阳东升西落，月亮圆了又缺；灿烂的白天，诡谲的星空；春夏秋冬，寒来暑往。这种目乱五色、变化多端的现象，都是因为什么呢？远古以来，我们的祖先就产生过许多猜测和幻想，力图回答这些问题。有的古人认为，世界好像是个圆形的大房间，这房间的地板就是我们所居住的大地，墙壁和天棚就是太空。我国古代也长期流行着“天圆地方”的说法。按照这种说法，天是以天中北极为中心而旋转的，而地则静止不动。
    以从事农业为主的古代中国、埃及和巴比仑人，通过对天象的观察来确定播种和收获的季节，这就推进了人类对宇宙的认识。后来巴尔干半岛上的希腊民族，在为了同埃及通商和占据富饶的移民地而进行的远洋航行中，学会了根据星星和月亮来测定路线和方向，这也使得天文学得到了很大的发展。
    希腊的天文学家们综合了许多观测的结果，创立了朴素的唯物主义的宇宙观。第一次提出了关于宇宙的无限性、物质世界的统一性、地是球形而且在运动、生命世界不止一个等等的卓越的猜想。例如赫拉克利特（公元前530—470年）说：“世界全体是统一的，既不是神也不是人创造的；无论过去、现在和将来，它都是永恒的烈火，有规律地燃烧起来，又有规律地熄灭下去。”又如阿里斯达卡斯（公元前四世纪末——三世纪前半期）认为大地有两种运动：绕太阳的公转运动和绕轴的自转运动。
    此外，希腊的科学家们还提出了一个在天文学发展上十分重要的思想，就是：大地是悬在空间的一个球体。毕达哥拉斯（约公元前571—497年）说：地和日月五星皆为球形，没有支柱而悬于太空；地球是它们的中心。后来尤多克斯（约公元前408—355年）发展了这个地球中心说，他设想了一个相当复杂的宇宙模型，有二十七个假想球，并有对这些球的旋转方向和速度的选择，以及对旋转轴的倾角的选择。
    接着，亚里斯多德（公元前384—322年）又将尤多克斯的宇宙模型加以改进。他把旋转球的数目从二十七个增加到五十六个，并在大球的外面，安放了一个“原动机”，好像是它引导着所有的球体运动的。
    后来阿波隆尼（约公元前二百年）用圆代替球来解释行星运动，他认为每个行星是作着圆的运动，而这个圆心又绕着地球作圆运动。阿波隆尼把行星运动的圆叫做本轮，把本轮圆心运动的圆叫做均轮。两个轮运动的速度经过选择以后，可以算出在当时说来是相当精确的行星方位。本轮均轮学说后来被托勒玫（公元后二世纪上半期）研究得更加完善了。他总结了前人的全部天文知识，写成十三大卷的“天文集”。这本书在十六世纪以前几乎是西方天文学家们的圣经。我国明代的“崇祯新法历书”，也曾译载过它的大纲。
    关于天旋地动的认识，我国在西汉末年也早已有过片断的记载。“春秋纬”“元命苞”中说：“天左旋，地右动”。“考灵曜”中说：“地常动不止，譬如人在舟中而坐，舟行而人不觉”。但是这些正确的臆想并没有得到发展。差不多和托勒玫同时代，我国出现了一个难得的天才，他就是主张浑天学说的张衡（78—139年）。张衡主张“天圆如弹丸，地如鸡中黄，孤居于内”；“天体于阳，故圆以动；地体于阴，故平以静”。我国在明末采用西法以前，历书所用的计算方法的理论根据，就是这个浑天学说。
            新的宇宙观
    商业和航海事业的发展，需要更精确地计量时间和在广阔的海洋上确定船只的位置的方法，于是不符合事实的地球中心说就没有立足之地了。这样，在资产阶级把封建贵族从统治的地位赶下来的同时，新的宇宙观也出现了：地球不再认为是宇宙的中心，它只是围绕太阳运转的行星之一。
    这个卓越的发现是伟大的波兰科学家哥白尼（1473—1543年）在十六世纪的上半期完成的。哥白尼的“天体运行论”是一部革命性的著作。这个学说一经传播，就立刻引起了教会的仇视。认为是邪说异端，并且严加禁止。
    但是禁止并不能停止科学的发展，接着著名的科学家布鲁诺（1548—1600年）和加利略（1564—1642年）又对哥白尼的学说作了光辉的发展。布鲁诺认为，宇宙是无限的；恒星是巨大的天体；太阳也不过是恒星中的一个，并不是宇宙的中心；恒星周围也有像地球一样的行星，上面也可能有和人一样的生物。加利略用自己发明的望远镜发现月球上的高山和太阳上的黑子的事实，驳斥了“完善的天体”和“罪恶的大地”的宗教胡说。他以木星连同它的四个卫星环绕太阳运行的实例，彻底打垮了所谓“月球既然环绕地球运行，就不可能再和地球一道环绕太阳运行”的谬说。
    布鲁诺和加利略对宗教迷信观念进行的这种勇敢的挑战，惹起了教会深刻的仇视，受到了残酷的迫害。布鲁诺被关了八年监狱以后，又在1600年2月17日被烧死在罗马的花之广场上。加利略在受到宗教裁判所的审判以后，只好战战兢兢地度过了自己的晚年。但是，真理总是要胜利的；支持哥白尼学说的天文发现，一个接着一个地出现了。
    开普勒（1571—1630年）修正了哥白尼的行星运动轨道是圆形的学说，提出了星球运动轨道是椭圆形的学说，开创了所谓“开普勒第一定律”。同时，他还发现行星离太阳近时走得快、离太阳远时走得慢的情况，确定了“开普勒第二定律”。他遵循哥白尼的离太阳较远的行星有较长的绕日公转周期，发现行星公转周期的平方跟行星与太阳距离的立方成正比，提出了有名的“开普勒第三定律”。开普勒三定律的发现，从根本上推翻了托勒玫的本轮均轮学说，推进了哥白尼的宇宙学说。这三条定律可以说成了行星运动的宪法，苏联人造行星也不例外地遵守着它。
    开普勒虽然确定了行星轨道的几何特性，但是这种运动的物理原因是什么？为什么行星沿着一定轨道绕太阳运动而不远走高飞？这些问题仍然不能解答。直到牛顿（1642—1727年）根据观测资料和行星运动的规律得出了万有引力的定律，才回答了这些问题。
    牛顿不但利用他发现的万有引力定律，详细地分析了行星、月亮和地面上一切物体的运动，而且还计算出每秒八公里的第一宇宙速度和每秒十一点二公里的第二宇宙速度。但是，由于当时最快的交通工具只是马车，所以牛顿没有料想到人类有飞上天空的本领。
    在牛顿之后出现了俄罗斯的伟大学者罗蒙诺索夫
  （1711—1765年）。他在自己一系列的著作中维护和发展了哥白尼学说。1761年他观测到了一次比较罕见的现象，就是：绕日运动的金星通过日地之间。通过这次观测，他发现金星是被浓厚的大气层包围着的。这就证明了金星是和地球相似的，从而给哥白尼学说以有力的支持。
            天体的形成
    罗蒙诺索夫不仅坚决地支持哥白尼学说，而且确定了物质宇宙普遍演化的思想。他说：“在地上看到的有形的东西以及整个的宇宙，起始都不像我们今天发现的这种状态，而是发生过巨大的变化。”这就把当时流行的形而上学的自然观打开了一个缺口。十七世纪下半期和十八世纪上半期科学界普遍的看法是：行星沿着不变的椭圆轨道运动，过去或将来都像现在这样。
    在反对这种观点方面起过重大作用的，要算是康德（于1755年）和拉普拉斯（于1796年）提出的星云假说了。按照星云假说，太阳系开始是一团转动着的气体星云。由于自身变冷和收缩的缘故，自转速度逐渐增加。在星云赤道离心力的作用下，一些物质从太阳分裂出来，形成了一个个行星。剩下来的中心物质，收缩为太阳。
    但是，以后不断发现太阳系的新的特点，这些特点和拉普拉斯的假说发生了矛盾。例如，有些卫星和彗星却是按照相反的方向运转的。特别是如果行星是按照星云假说形成的，则太阳和行星的角动量应当各自保持星云分出环以前那样的大小；就是说，质量越大，自转得越快。但是事实上，总质量只合太阳质量千分之几的各行星，却保持了太阳系总角动量的98％以上。
    面对着这个严重困难，资产阶级的天文学家们，由于阶级的局限性和方法论的错误，束手无策。只有以辩证唯物主义武装起来的苏联学者，才提出比较合理的方案，这就是施米特学说。施米特院士认为：太阳在它形成的初期，或者在它围绕银河系中心运动时，穿过尘埃云并俘获其中的一部分。这种尘埃中包含有大大小小的微粒。在太阳的引力作用下，微粒群在一定的轨道上运行而且互相撞冲，随即粘结在一起，最后形成了行星。碰撞的过程中，有平均化的作用，因而质量越大的行星轨道越圆，并且轨道面越与太阳的赤道面相合。近太阳的区域，由于温度高，许多质点都蒸发了，所以水星和金星的质量比较小；离太阳远的区域，本来俘获的东西就少，所以冥王星也小；只有木星和土星所在的区域适中，所以形成了两个特别大的行星。施米特又假定，太阳本来不会自转，只是被俘获的尘埃落在它上面带来了角动量以后，才开始自转，所以它的角动量很小。
          天外还有天
    对于太阳系以外恒星的研究，一直到了十九世纪中叶才有较大的发展。在此以前，天文学家们的主要兴趣都局限在太阳系的研究上，只有赫歇耳（1738—1822年）和斯特鲁维（1793—1864年）提出过一些关于银河系结构的想法和对恒星距离的测定。
    十九世纪中叶，由于物理学的发展，产生了光谱分析法。通过对从星球上射来的光线的分析，可以研究恒星的化学成分和物理状态（温度、密度、压力等），测定恒星的运动速度，以及研究天体的许多其他性质。到了本世纪的二十年代，天文学利用了原子物理学的成就，还能从观测得来的恒星表面现象，推测它的内部结构和能量来源等等。第二次世界大战后，由于无线电技术的发展，又补充了光学观测方法的不足。光谱分析法向人类显示出了宇宙物质的多种多样性。人们看到：有亮度突然增加几亿倍的超新星，有呈周期性的一胀一缩的脉动星，有成双结对的双星，有三五成群的聚星，有几百、几千或几万颗星组成的星团。有直径大到太阳的二千一百倍的“柱一星”，也有小到直径只有太阳的千分之三的“万马南星”。有密度大到水的三千六百万倍的白矮星，也有密度稀薄得和真空差不多的红巨星。有表面温度高到八万度的早型星，也有仅两千度的晚型星。
    通过这些复杂的现象，天文学家们也发现了不少的内在联系。例如，1900年发现，按光谱的特征来区别，恒星可分为十大类，即十个“光谱型”，各类型之间又存在着联系。1913年罗素在研究恒星的光谱型和它真正的发光本领（用“绝对星等”表示）的时候，得到了一个极为重要的关系，即“光度—光谱图”，又叫“罗素图”。在光度—光谱图上绝大多数恒星都处在由左上角到右下角的一条对角线上，这叫做“主星序”；在对角线的右上方是巨星和超巨星，在对角线的右下方是白矮星。
    罗素图发现以后，人们就纷纷猜想这个图必然代表演化上的联系，但是并没有得到科学的根据。一直到1947年苏联天文家阿姆巴楚米扬发现了星协以后，人们才认识到：恒星在银河系内还在不断的形成，刚形成的恒星从主星序的全线进入主星序，然后沿主星序从左上角向右下角演化。阿姆巴楚米扬的这一发现，给唯心主义的关于恒星是“同时创造”的观点和西欧流行的“恒星是从虚无中产生”的妄说以致命的打击，显示了辩证唯物主义无往而不胜的革命性和科学性。
            认识无止境
    我们肉眼所看到的恒星，都属于银河系。银河系内现在大约有一千五百亿颗恒星。太阳也在这个银河系里头，但不在中心，大约离中心有二万三千五百光年（一光年等于十万亿公里）。太阳跟它的行星们一道，以每秒二百五十公里的高速度在围绕银河中心旋转，但是，它走一圈还得一亿八千万年。银河之大，由此可见。
    然而，银河并不等于宇宙，银河之外还有银河，那叫做“河外星系”或“星系”。关于河外星系的研究，现在刚开始，不过已有不少发现，例如，每个星系都和银河一样，其中有各种各样的恒星；星系之间也有三五成群的现象；各种类型的星系之间似乎也有演化上的联系。
    资产阶级的天文家们常常根据爱因斯坦的相对论，设想宇宙是有限的，然而新型天文仪器的观测一次又一次地突破了他们所设想的界边。例如，1927年英国的天文家秦斯认为：宇宙的边界好像在离我们四百万光年的地方；但不到两年，到1929年，望远镜就看到了离我们一亿四千万光年的河外星系。现在世界最大的望远镜，已经可以看到离我们五亿光年的河外星系。并且，已经发现在以五亿光年为半径的这个宇宙球体范围内，河外星系数目在一亿以上。由此可见，在这个范围以外的河外星系，就更不知有多少了。
    面对着这种人类认识宇宙范围的不断扩大和新事物的不断发现，资产阶级的科学家们显得多么的软弱无力和感到前途茫茫。秦斯说：“天文学永远不能在自己的研究中得到结论，它所得到的唯一结论是在宇宙中没有任何是可靠的。”英国伦敦大学科学史教授辛格尔，在总结一百年（1850—1950年）来的科学成就时也说：“如若以为科学是要探索宇宙的秘密和知道自然界的规律，那末，这一百年来辛勤研究所得的结果就是：我们的宇宙是不可知的，而且是自相矛盾的”。资产阶级的学者囿于他们的形而上学、不可知论的认识论观点，是这样地对人类认识世界的能力对科学的发展前途丧失了信心！我们辩证唯物主义者却对人类的认识能力充满着信心，对科学发展充满着信心。我们认为：宇宙是无限的，人类认识宇宙的能力也是无限的，“我们的知识向客观的、绝对的真理接近的界限是受历史条件制约的，但是这个真理的存在是无条件的，我们向它的接近也是无条件的”。（列宁：“唯物主义和经验批判主义”）“世界上没有不可认识之物，只有现在尚未认识，但将来却会由科学和实践力量揭示和认识之物”（斯大林“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”）。不是吗，现在苏联宇宙火箭已经飞上天，星际航行的时代即将到来，太阳系的范围成了地理学的边界。未来在水星和冥王星上的天文观测将会得到许多新资料；而一旦光子火箭成功，恒星际的旅行更不知要揭开多少宇宙秘密。
