Spring Festival Flower Market Visit
Walking the streets as agreed to see the flower market, yet leaning on the arcade like a gallery. Potted plants stand in rows, herbs and trees competing in fragrance. Lanterns shine all night, people are like weaving, a scene of singing, joy is overwhelming. Precisely this year's scenery is beautiful, thousands of reds and purples herald the spring.
		February 7, 1959, in Guangzhou

    春节看花市 
    林伯渠迈街相约看花市，却倚骑楼似画廊。束立盆栽成队列，草株木本斗芬芳。通宵灯火人如织，一派歌声喜欲狂。正是今年风景美，千红万紫报春光。
        一九五九年二月七日于广州
