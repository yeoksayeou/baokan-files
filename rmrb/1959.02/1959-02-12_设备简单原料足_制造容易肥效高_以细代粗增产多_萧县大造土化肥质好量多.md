Xiaoxian County Massively Produces Native Fertilizer with Good Quality and High Quantity
    (Our newspaper Hefei, 11th dispatch) Anhui Province's Xiaoxian County, based on calculating tasks, calculating labor, and summarizing last year's experience in massively producing native fertilizer, and according to the principles of simple equipment, sufficient raw materials, low technology, high fertilizer efficiency, and everyone can manufacture, has launched another campaign to massively produce native fertilizer, aiming to prepare 900 million catties of native fertilizer for various crops this year.
    Native fertilizer has high fertilizer efficiency and increases production significantly; and it can save a lot of manpower in transportation. The people of Xiaoxian County have the deepest understanding of these issues. Last year, the county produced more than 215 million catties of native fertilizer, which, if converted into coarse fertilizer, would be 21.5 billion catties. If each person accumulated 10,000 catties of coarse fertilizer per day, it would require more than 7,000 laborers to accumulate for about a year, and 6,000 livestock to transport for a year. However, with these native fertilizers, not only are so many laborers and livestock not needed, but also the production of many crops, especially cash crops, throughout the county is guaranteed to increase by nearly two times. Liu Dewen Team of Guanghui People's Commune in Jiudian Township planted wheat on 12 mu of sandy land, applying 200 cartloads of miscellaneous fertilizer and 230 catties of native fertilizer, with a yield of 917 catties per mu. Among them, 2 mu yielded 1,470 catties of wheat per mu. In the same location and with the same soil quality, other wheat, due to only applying miscellaneous fertilizer and not native fertilizer, yielded only 180 catties per mu. The significant contrast made the masses clearly realize the benefits of native fertilizer. The masses generally reflected, "Native fertilizer is a priceless treasure, it can make crops grow well; the whole people massively produce native fertilizer, and we can't finish eating the grain we produce."
    The soil quality in Xiaoxian County is very poor. Among the 1.8 million mu of land, there are more than 980,000 mu of sandy land, accounting for 54.8%, which requires sufficient good fertilizer to achieve higher yields. According to the production plan formulated by the county party committee this year, the need for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers, if converted into coarse fertilizer, totals 8 billion dan. If the tools for accumulating fertilizer are reformed, and each person accumulates 200 dan of fertilizer per day, it would require 142,000 people (accounting for 40% of the county's labor force) to work for a year. If 50% of the native fertilizer is accumulated and applied locally, and 50% is transported, it would require 16,000 livestock to haul it for a year, occupying most of the county's 20,000 livestock. According to this calculation, if all coarse fertilizer is used, the labor and livestock power cannot be solved. In order to ensure the realization of this year's production targets and solve the contradiction of labor and livestock shortage, the county party committee decided to further carry out the movement to massively produce native fertilizer while vigorously accumulating fertilizer, building factories in every team, substituting fine for coarse, and seizing the production of more than ten kinds of native fertilizer such as niter soil fertilizer, nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium mixed fertilizer, and artificial urine, planning to produce 900 million catties of various native fertilizers annually, so that each mu of land in the county has an average of 500 catties of native fertilizer. This can save more than 32,000 laborers and more than 1,700 livestock.
    The raw materials for manufacturing native fertilizer, such as soot, sewage, corn cobs, sweet potato stems, and niter soil, are easy to collect, and the manufacturing method is also very simple. For example, to make niter soil fertilizer, add water to the niter soil in batches for filtering. Boil the filtered niter water several times, skim off the salt on top, and then cool it to become niter water fertilizer, with each catty equivalent to the fertilizer efficiency of 100 catties of coarse manure. The manufacturing of nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium mixed fertilizer is also very simple. Boil 60% niter water and 10% bone meal in a pot for 20 to 30 minutes, then add 20% yellow soil and 10% gypsum (substitutes can be used) and stir-fry. It is even more convenient to make artificial urine. Just grind corn cobs, sweet potato stems, or soybean cakes into powder, add water and put them into a manure pond or tank, tighten the lid, stir it every two to three days, and after half a month, the surface will turn green, and the fertilizer efficiency is similar to urine.
    The county party committee requires all localities to earnestly absorb last year's experience, implement political command, and strengthen ideological education. Each commune and production team should designate a deputy secretary to specifically manage native fertilizer production, lead experiments, cultivate typical examples, organize visits, and exchange experiences; continue to vigorously carry out mass movements, rebuild and build new native fertilizer factories. Each commune should establish a comprehensive experimental factory on the original basis to create experience and promote it comprehensively; each production team should establish a production factory to combine the whole people with professional teams, and combine regular and shock work. Establish a fixed professional team to specialize in the regular production of native fertilizer, and resolutely implement the policy of combining native and foreign methods, and transitioning from native to foreign methods. The county party committee is preparing to build a large-scale native fertilizer factory, and each township and commune should also create conditions to prepare for the transition from native production to foreign production.
    Now, a movement to massively produce native fertilizer has been vigorously launched in Xiaoxian County. According to statistics on February 4, more than 1,100 native fertilizer factories have been built throughout the county, with more than 13,000 fixed laborers, producing 17 different kinds of native fertilizer, with a daily output of more than 161,300 catties. At the same time, recovery work is also in full swing. For example, some native fertilizer factories in Yonggu Township stopped last year due to insufficient labor. Recently, in the movement to massively produce native fertilizer, 63 factories were restored overnight. At present, the masses in various places have invested in this movement with the same vigor as fighting steel, busy day and night restoring and building new native fertilizer factories. It is estimated that 2,000 to 3,000 factories can be built by the end of the month, and the daily output can reach 300,000 to 500,000 catties. (Yu Ming, Chen Lixin) (Attached photo)

    设备简单原料足  制造容易肥效高  以细代粗增产多
    萧县大造土化肥质好量多
    本报合肥11日电　安徽省萧县在算任务、算劳力、总结去年大造土化肥经验的基础上，根据设备简单、原料足、技术低、肥效高、人人能造的原则，又掀起了一个大搞土化肥的运动，要在今年为各种农作物准备九亿斤土化肥。
    土化肥的肥效高，增产多；并在运输当中能节省大量人力。萧县人民对这些问题体会最深。去年全县造了二亿一千五百多万斤土化肥，如折合成粗肥，就有二百一十五亿斤，如以每天每人积一万斤粗肥计，就需要七千多个劳力大约要积一年，六千个牲畜运输一年。但是有了这些土化肥，不仅不需要这样多的劳力、畜力，而且保证了全县许多农作物，特别是经济作物增产近二倍。九店乡光辉人民公社刘德文队，在十二亩飞沙地上种小麦，上了二百车杂肥，二百三十斤土化肥，亩产九百一十七斤。其中有二亩亩产小麦一千四百七十斤。同一地点，同一土质情况下的其他小麦，由于只上了杂肥，未上土化肥，亩产只有一百八十斤。显著的对比，使群众清楚地认识到了土化肥的好处。群众普遍反映说：“土化肥，无价宝，能让庄稼长得好；全民大搞土化肥，生产粮食吃不了。”。
    萧县土地的土质都是很差的。一百八十万亩土地中，沙地就有九十八万多亩，占54.8％，需要上足够的好肥料才能多收。根据今年县委制定的生产规划，需要氮肥磷肥钾肥，三者如折合粗肥，共有八十亿担。假如改革了积肥工具，每人每天积肥二百担，那就需要十四万二千人（占全县劳力40％）劳动一年。如按50％的土肥就地积，就地施，50％土肥拉运，这也将需要一万六千头牲畜拉一年，占去全县二万头牲畜的大半。根据这一笔账，要全搞土肥，劳畜力就无法解决。为了保证今年生产指标的实现，解决劳力、畜力缺乏的矛盾，县委决定在大搞积肥的同时，进一步开展大造土化肥运动，队队建厂，以细代粗，以质胜量大抓硝土肥，氮磷钾混合肥，人造尿等十多种土化肥的生产，计划年产各种土化肥九亿斤，使全县土地每亩平均有五百斤土化肥。这样可以节省三万二千多个劳动力，一千七百多头畜力。
    制造土化肥的原料，如煤烟、污水、玉米心、红芋梗、硝土等很容易收集，制法也很简单。如制硝土肥将硝土分次加水进行过淋，淋出的硝水，加热煮几滚，捞出上面的食盐后，即可起出冷却成为硝水肥，每斤相当于一百斤粗粪的肥效。氮磷钾混合肥料制造起来也很简单，用60％硝水，10％骨粉放在锅里煮沸二、三十分钟，再把20％的黄土，10％石膏（可用代用物）加入炒拌即成。造人造尿更方便，只要用玉米心、红芋梗或豆饼，磨成粉，加水放入粪池或缸内，把盖盖紧，每二到三天搅拌一次，经半月，表面变绿色即成，肥效也和尿相似。
    县委要求各地认真吸取去年的经验，实行政治挂帅，加强思想教育。各公社、生产队要指定一个副书记专门管理土化肥生产，领导试验，培养典型，组织参观，交流经验；继续大搞群众运动，重建和新建土化肥厂。各公社应在原有基础上建立一个综合试验厂，创造经验，全面推广；各生产队应建立一个生产厂，做到全民与专业队结合，经常与突击结合。固定专业队伍，专搞土化肥经常生产，坚决执行土洋结合，由土到洋的方针。县委正筹建一个大型土化肥厂，各乡社也要创造条件，准备由土法生产过渡到洋法生产。
    现在，一个大造土化肥的运动已在萧县蓬勃展开，据2月4日统计，全县已建土化肥厂一千一百多个，固定劳力一万三千多个，生产出十七种不同种类的土化肥，日产十六万一千三百多斤。同时，恢复工作也正在紧张进行，如永堌乡去年有些土化肥厂因为劳力不足，停下来了。最近在大造土化肥运动中，一夜就恢复了六十三个厂。目前，各地群众都以大战钢铁的劲头，投入了这一运动，日夜忙碌恢复和新建土化肥厂，估计月底可建成二到三千个厂，日产量可达三百到五百万斤。　（于明、陈立信）（附图片）
