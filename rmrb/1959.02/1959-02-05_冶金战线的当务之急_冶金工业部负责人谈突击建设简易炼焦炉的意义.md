Xinhua News Agency, 4th.
The most prominent and urgent task in the metallurgical industry right now is to build a large number of "No. 2" simple coke ovens. A Xinhua News Agency reporter interviewed a responsible person from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry about this matter.

The responsible person first spoke about the important significance of vigorously increasing the production of high-quality coke this year. He said that on the metallurgical industry front, we must concentrate our forces to win a major battle, which is to rush to build a large number of "No. 2" simple coke ovens in the near future and put them into production smoothly. This battle is the first key to ensuring the completion of this year's production plan of 18 million tons of steel, as well as corresponding pig iron and steel materials. Why do we say this? Because the current situation is: good steel depends on good iron, good iron depends on good coke; tracing back to the source, producing large quantities of high-quality coke has become the key to completing this year's steel production task.

Analyzing from a quantitative perspective, completing this year's steel production plan of 18 million tons and the corresponding pig iron plan requires more than double the amount of coke compared to 1958; however, relying on the output of China's existing large and medium-sized modern coke ovens, plus the output of a batch of large and medium-sized modern coke ovens put into production this year, still cannot meet this need.

Analyzing from a qualitative perspective, according to general calculations, 80% of the sulfur content in pig iron is brought in by coke. Therefore, first reducing the sulfur, phosphorus, and ash content in coke is a fundamental measure to improve the quality of steel and iron.

It can be seen that increasing the quantity and quality of coke production has become a problem that all metallurgical workers must pay extremely close attention to, should vigorously promote, and effectively and quickly solve.

Why should we promote the "No. 2" simple coke oven? The responsible person said that there are currently three ways to develop coke production in our country: First, build large and medium-sized modern coke ovens, which is necessary. Our country has also built a batch of these coke ovens this year. These coke ovens should be accelerated and put into production as early as possible. However, this type of coke oven requires a long construction time and a large amount of equipment, and relying solely on this batch of modern coke ovens cannot quickly solve the current urgent need for a large amount of coke.

The second is the indigenous method of coking. This coking method directly heats coal, has a low coking rate, and the resulting coke has a high sulfur, phosphorus, and ash content. Moreover, it cannot recover a large amount of coal tar and by-products, resulting in significant losses. It is estimated that if the indigenous method of coking is used to solve the coke supply problem this year, the country will consume tens of millions of tons more coal and increase the transportation volume of this coal, which is an unnecessary waste for the country. Therefore, except for areas with inconvenient transportation and a lack of power, where it is still necessary to use indigenous methods to make some coke, it is generally not advisable for other areas to use them unconditionally in large quantities. Areas that use indigenous methods of coking must also carefully wash and select coal for coking.

The third way, and the most important way at present, is to build simple coke ovens. Simple coke ovens have many advantages. First of all, they require very little investment in construction, equipment, and materials, and the construction time is fast. The complete set of equipment for each "No. 2" simple coke oven is only a water pump, a suction fan, and two small electric motors; the building materials are mainly clay firebricks and red bricks, which can be produced locally everywhere. Some pipes can be replaced with ceramic pipes, and only a small amount of steel and cast iron parts are needed. The investment in each building is only about twenty to thirty thousand yuan. It only takes twenty to thirty days from construction to coke production. Secondly, simple coke ovens have a large output of coke, good quality, and save coal. The coke produced is suitable for medium and small blast furnaces.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry emphasized that to complete the construction task of simple coke ovens with more, faster, better, and more economical results, the most fundamental problem is to firmly grasp ideological leadership, give prominence to politics, and fully recognize the huge economic and political significance of building this batch of coke ovens. Leading cadres at all levels of the metallurgical industry departments should personally take action to complete the task in one go. The person in charge requested that the metallurgical industry departments (bureaus) of all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions currently focus on doing the following things well:

First, firmly grasp the planning for the construction of simple coke ovens. This batch of coke ovens should be laid out according to three principles and three conditions. The three principles are: close to the user department, that is, close to the blast furnace group; close to coal mines and coal washing plants; and appropriately concentrated. The three conditions are: water, electricity, and convenient transportation. Only in this way can the coke ovens be put into production quickly and managed rationally after they are built.

Second, firmly grasp the manufacturing of complete sets of coke oven equipment. The Ministry of First Machine Building and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have now arranged the equipment for this batch of coke ovens to relevant machinery factories and metallurgical factories, and have begun production. It is hoped that the leaders of provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and factories will strengthen inspection and ensure delivery on time.

Third, firmly grasp the preparation of building materials needed for coke oven construction and prepare various construction conditions to ensure construction starts on schedule. The main building materials, such as refractory bricks, red bricks, ceramic pipes, and lime, are all solved by local self-reliance.

Fourth, firmly grasp the construction. Various measures should be taken, and inspection and acceptance systems should be established to ensure that the quality of this batch of coke ovens must meet the requirements: no air leakage, high-temperature resistance, and good heat transfer. When arranging the furnace construction plan, various places can adopt the method of batch construction, using the first batch of coke ovens as experimental furnaces to gain experience, and then vigorously promote them and make them bloom everywhere.

Fifth, firmly grasp the training of production personnel. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has already opened a training class for coking personnel, and has transferred a group of engineering and design personnel from the Iron and Steel Research Institute and the Coking Chemical Design Institute to various places to help train new workers. It is required that all localities intensify this work.

The person in charge finally said that this year is a year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward for the metallurgical industry. The tasks facing metallurgical workers across the country are glorious and arduous. In order to ensure the completion of this year's steel production task, we must win the battle of building furnaces and coking at present. We believe that under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels and with the cooperation of fraternal departments such as machinery and coal, metallurgical workers across the country will surely be able to successfully complete this urgent task and provide favorable conditions for completing this year's 18 million tons of steel, pig iron, and steel materials plan.

    冶金战线的当务之急
    ——冶金工业部负责人谈突击建设简易炼焦炉的意义
    新华社4日讯　冶金工业当前最突出、最急迫的一项工作，是大批建设“二号”简易炼焦炉。新华社记者就这件事，访问了冶金工业部的负责人。
    负责人首先谈到今年大力增产质量良好的焦炭的重要意义。他说，当前冶金工业战线上必须集中力量打赢一个大仗，这就是要在最近期间突击建成大批“二号”简易炼焦炉，并使它们顺利投入生产。这一仗，是确保完成今年一千八百万吨钢以及与此相适应的生铁、钢材等生产计划的第一个关键。为什么这样说呢？因为目前的情况是：好钢材决定于好钢，好钢决定于好铁，好铁决定于好焦炭；追本求源，生产量多质好的焦炭，就成了完成今年钢铁生产任务的关键。
    从数量上分析，完成今年一千八百万吨钢和相应的生铁计划，需要焦炭的数量比1958年增加一倍以上；而依靠我国现有大中型现代化炼焦炉的产量，再加上今年投入生产的一批大中型现代化炼焦炉的产量，仍不能满足这个需要。
    从质量上分析，据一般的计算，生铁中的含硫量，有80％是焦炭带进去的，因此，首先降低焦炭中的硫、磷含量和灰分，是提高钢、铁质量釜底抽薪的治本措施。
    由此可见，提高焦炭生产的数量和质量，已经成为所有冶金工作者当前必须极其重视的问题，应该大力进行，并且有效地、迅速地加以解决。
    为什么要推广“二号”简易炼焦炉？负责人回答这个问题时说，我国目前发展焦炭生产有三个途径：第一是建设大型的和中型的现代化炼焦炉，这是必要的。我国今年也新建了一批这种炼焦炉。这些焦炉应该加速建设，及早投入生产。但是这种炼焦炉需要的建设时间长，设备量也大，单纯依靠这批现代化炼焦炉，不能迅速解决当前对焦炭的大量急需。
    第二是土法炼焦。这种炼焦方法是对煤炭直接加热，结焦率低，所产焦炭硫、磷含量和灰分都很高，而且不能大量回收焦油和副产品，损失很大。据估计，今年如果采用土法炼焦解决焦炭的供应问题，全国将要多消耗几千万吨煤和增加这些煤炭的运输量，对国家来说是不必要的浪费。因此，除交通不便、缺乏动力的地区，还有必要采用土法炼一些焦外，一般地区不宜无条件地大量采用。采用土法炼焦的地区也必须认真进行洗选炼焦用煤。
    第三条途径，也是当前最重要的一条途径，就是建设简易炼焦炉。简易炼焦炉有很多优点。首先，它需要的建设投资、设备、材料都很少，建设时间快。每座“二号”简易炼焦炉的全套设备只不过是一台水泵，一台吸风机和两台小电动机；建筑材料以粘土耐火砖和红砖为大宗，各地都可以自己生产，部分管道可以用陶瓷管代替，只用少量钢材和铸铁件。每座建设投资不过两、三万元。从施工到出焦，只要二、三十天时间就够了。其次，简易炼焦炉焦炭产量大、质量好、节约煤炭，所生产的焦炭，适合中、小型高炉需要。
   冶金工业部负责人强调指出，要又多、又快、又好、又省地完成简易焦炉的建设任务，最根本的问题是要抓紧思想领导，要政治挂帅，要充分认识到建设这一批炼焦炉的巨大经济意义和政治意义，由冶金工业部门各级领导干部亲自动手，一鼓作气地完成。负责人要求各省、市、自治区的冶金工业厅（局）目前抓紧作好几件事：
    一，抓紧建设简易炼焦炉的规划。这批炼焦炉要根据三条原则、三个条件布局。三条原则是：靠近使用部门，即靠近高炉群；靠近煤矿和洗煤场；适当地集中一些。三个条件是：有水，有电，交通方便。只有这样，才能使焦炉建成后，迅速投入生产和合理地进行管理。
    二，抓紧焦炉成套设备的制造工作。第一机械工业部和冶金工业部现在已把这一批焦炉的设备布置到有关机械工厂和冶金工厂去了，并已开始制作，希望各省、市、自治区和各厂领导上加强检查，保证按期交货。
    三，抓紧准备建设焦炉所需的建筑材料，准备各种施工条件，保证按期动工兴建。主要的建筑材料，如耐火砖、红砖、陶瓷管、石灰等，都由各地自力更生解决。
    四，抓紧施工。要采取各种措施，订立检查、验收制度，保证这一批焦炉的质量一定达到：不漏气，耐高温，传热好。各地安排建炉计划时可以采取分批施工的办法，把第一批焦炉作为试验炉，从中取得经验，然后大力推广，遍地开花。
    五，抓紧培训生产人员。冶金工业部已经开办了一个炼焦人员训练班，并由钢铁研究院和焦化设计院抽调一批工程、设计人员，前往各地帮助培训新工人，要求各地加紧进行这一工作。
    负责人最后说，今年是冶金工业更大、更好、更全面地跃进的一年，摆在全国冶金工作者面前的任务是光荣而艰巨的。为了确保完成今年的钢铁生产任务，当前必须打赢建炉炼焦这一仗。我们相信，在各级党委的统一领导下，和机械、煤炭等有关兄弟部门的协作配合下，全国冶金工作者一定能够胜利地完成这一紧急任务，为完成今年的一千八百万吨钢和生铁、钢材计划提供有利的条件。
