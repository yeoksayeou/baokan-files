Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd dispatch from Blantyre: Ignoring threats from British colonial authorities, the Nyasaland African National Congress held a rally in Blantyre on the 22nd as planned, demanding freedom. On that day, colonial authorities dispatched large numbers of police and troops, and used air force reconnaissance planes for aerial reconnaissance to carry out suppression.

Chipembere, an African member of the Legislative Council who presided over the meeting, said that representatives from thirty-two branches of the African National Congress attended the meeting, even though they knew they faced the threat of death due to the barbaric police and troops. He said, "We are prepared to die for our homeland."

Kumtumanje, a soon-to-be-retired regional leader of the party, said at the meeting, "We are not afraid, even though the British authorities have transferred troops equipped with various weapons from Cyprus, Kenya, and Malaya." He said, "If they like, they can transfer NATO troops, but we will continue to move forward until we break away from the Federation and achieve self-governance."

After the meeting, the masses gathered near the clock tower in the city center, where police used tear gas against them, injuring at least fifty people.

On the same day, demonstrations were also held in Limbe (a city adjacent to Blantyre). Police carried out brutal attacks on the demonstrators, also resulting in injuries.

In Chisenja, about four hundred people demonstrated. In Hillburg, the airport was once controlled by demonstrating crowds. Officials also admitted that the situation in Visanza was "unstable" and that some troops had been sent there.

A statement issued by the Nyasaland colonial government on the evening of the 22nd revealed that some people had been arrested in some parts of northern and central Nyasaland.

The situation in Nyasaland has caused serious unease in London. The "Sunday Express" wrote: "Nyasaland may be starting a real African uprising. This wave may soon sweep across the entire northern region and even extend to Southern Rhodesia."

Xinhua News Agency, February 24th dispatch from Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia: The struggle of Africans in various parts of Nyasaland against British colonialists is continuing. In Blantyre, a larger-than-usual number of Africans gathered in the clock tower area on the evening of the 23rd. Colonial authorities dispatched large numbers of police and reserve police. This place had experienced bloodshed on the 22nd due to the colonial authorities' suppression of demonstrators.

The atmosphere in the Blantyre and Limbe areas is tense. British Air Force reconnaissance planes flew low over the area on the 23rd, threatening the Africans. Fearing attacks from Africans, the colonial authorities are cutting down the jungle in this area. One African worker and three youths were arrested.

The situation in other parts of Nyasaland is also unstable. According to colonial authorities, the Hillburg airport, which was occupied by rioters on the 22nd, is still in the hands of Africans. On the 24th, thousands of African workers constructing the Kariba Dam went on strike, demanding higher wages.

There are also reports that discontent among Africans in Northern Rhodesia is also growing. Some African leaders have openly declared that if their demands for autonomy are not met, they will take violent action.

The British colonial authorities continue to dispatch troops to carry out suppression. A squadron of "Vampire" jet fighters belonging to the Royal Rhodesian Air Force has been ordered to fly to Nyasaland. Welensky, the Prime Minister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, announced on the 23rd that he was calling up the Southern Rhodesia Defense Volunteer Reserve to several cities in the Federation. Due to the large number of troops being transferred to Nyasaland, colonial authorities are feeling uneasy about their control of the situation in other places.

The situation in Nyasaland has caused shock in Britain. According to sources from London, the British Minister of State for Colonial Affairs, Perth, hurriedly decided to go to Nyasaland this week to inspect.

The "Daily Worker" criticized the colonialists' suppression of the African people's independence movement in an editorial on the 24th. The editorial pointed out that British Prime Minister Macmillan recently said: "Imperialism is an episode in history. It is no longer the current reality." The newspaper refuted: "If imperialism is an episode in history, why are armies, police, and jet planes still being used against the Africans in Nyasaland?"

Labour MP Richard Crossman wrote in the "Daily Mirror" on the 24th: "The truth is that the rule of white immigrants in Central and East Africa is doomed, and white immigrants can only survive by recognizing the Africans' demands for freedom and equality."

    尼亚萨兰反殖民统治怒潮汹涌
    各地群众纷纷示威集会坚决争取自由
    英国殖民当局出动大批军警野蛮镇压
    新华社23日讯　布兰太尔消息：尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会不顾英国殖民当局的威胁，22日按照预定计划在布兰太尔举行了一次要求取得自由的集会。这一天，殖民当局出动了大批警察和军队并且使用空军侦察机作空中侦察来进行镇压。
    主持会议的立法议会非洲人议员契佩姆贝雷说，非洲人国民大会三十二个支部的代表出席了会议，虽然他们知道由于有着野蛮的警察和军队，他们面临着死亡的威胁。他说，我们准备为了我们的国土而死。
    这个党的一位即将退休的省区领导人库姆土曼杰在会上说，我们并不害怕，虽然英国当局从塞浦路斯、怯尼亚和马来亚调来了配备着各种武器的军队。他说，如果他们喜欢的话，他们可以把北大西洋公约组织的部队调来，但是我们将继续前进，直到我们脱离联邦，实现我们自己治理自己。
    会后，群众集会在市中心的钟楼附近，警察对他们使用了催泪弹，至少有五十人受伤。
    同一天，在林贝（与布兰太尔邻接的城市），也有群众举行示威。警察对示威者进行野蛮的攻击，也有人因此受伤。
    在契森加，约有四百人举行示威。在希尔堡，飞机场一度为示威群众所控制。官方还承认，维桑札局势“不稳”，已经把一些军队派去。
    尼亚萨兰殖民政府22日晚间发表的声明透露，在尼亚萨兰北部和中部一些地方都逮捕了一些人。
    尼亚萨兰的形势引起伦敦严重的不安。“星期日快报”写道：“尼亚萨兰可能开始实在的非洲起义。这种浪潮可能很快地席卷整个北部地区，甚至会扩大到南罗得西亚。”
    新华社24日讯　南罗得西亚索耳兹伯里消息：尼亚萨兰各地非洲人反抗英国殖民者的斗争仍在继续中。在布兰太尔，23日傍晚有比平常多得多的非洲人聚集在钟楼地区。殖民当局出动了大批警察和后备警察。这个地方在22日曾经由于殖民当局镇压示威群众而发生流血事件。
    布兰太尔和林贝地区的空气紧张。英国空军的侦察机23日在这个地区不断低飞而过，对非洲人进行威胁。为了畏惧非洲人的袭击，殖民当局正在将这一带的丛林砍掉。有一名非洲工人和三名青年被捕。
    尼亚萨兰其他地方情势也不稳。据殖民当局透露，为暴动者在22日占领的希尔堡机场，仍在非洲人手中。24日，正在修卡里巴水坝的数千名非洲工人举行了罢工，要求提高工资。
    还有消息说，北罗得西亚非洲人对殖民当局的不满情绪也正在发展中。有些非洲人领袖已经公开宣布，倘若不满足他们自治的要求，将采取暴力行动。
    英国殖民当局继续调遣军队来进行镇压。皇家罗得西亚空军所属一个“吸血鬼”式喷气战斗机中队已奉命飞往尼亚萨兰。罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦总理韦伦斯基23日宣布，正在调用南罗得西亚的国防义勇军后备兵到这个联邦的几个城市中去。由于大量军队被调集到尼亚萨兰去，殖民当局对其他地方局势的控制感到不安。
    尼亚萨兰的形势在英国引起震惊。据来自伦敦的消息说，英国协办殖民地事务国务大臣佩思慌忙决定在本星期赶到尼亚萨兰去视察。
    “工人日报”24日在社论中抨击殖民者对非洲人民独立运动的镇压。社论指出，英国首相麦克米伦最近曾经说：“帝国主义是历史上的一段插曲。它已经不再是当前的现实了。”这家报纸驳斥说：“如果帝国主义是历史上一段插曲的话，为什么还用军队、警察和喷气式飞机来对付尼亚萨兰的非洲人呢？”
    工党议员理查德·克罗斯曼24日在“每日镜报”上撰文说：“真相是，白种移民者在中非和东非的统治注定要完蛋了，只有承认非洲人关于自由和平等的要求，白种移民者才能够存在下去。”
