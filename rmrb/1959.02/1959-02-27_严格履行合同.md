    Strictly Fulfill Contracts
    "The entire nation as a single chessboard" is an important principle for rationally utilizing manpower, materials, and financial resources to ensure greater, faster, better, and more economical production and construction. One of the requirements of this principle is close cooperation among various regions, departments, and enterprises.
    This cooperation is sometimes manifested in mutual support at any time and place, and more often in the form of order contracts signed between various units. All contracts signed in accordance with the principles of centralized leadership and unified arrangement are moves in the national chessboard. They often have the nature of "moving one piece affecting the whole game." These contracts must be treated seriously and completed on schedule, with guaranteed quality and quantity.
    In the process of fulfilling contracts, some difficulties may be encountered. This requires overcoming various difficulties and resolutely completing the task in the spirit of subordinating the part to the whole and selflessness. The Dalian Engineering and Mining Vehicle Factory's proposal to "think of the user in everything" is essentially thinking of the overall situation. This spirit is worthy of promotion.
    Anyone who knows how to play chess understands that the victory of the whole game depends on the implementation of a unified intention by each move and each piece. If all units strictly fulfill their contracts, so that every piece has a place and every move hits the target, the whole game can be won with certainty.

    严格履行合同
    “全国一盘棋”，是合理地使用人力、物力、财力，保证多快好省地进行生产建设的重要方针。这一方针的要求之一，是各个地区、各个部门、各个企业之间密切协作。
    这种协作有时表现为随时随地的相互支援，在更多的情况下常用各个单位之间签订订货合同等形式表现出来。凡是根据集中领导和统一安排的原则签订的合同，都是全国一盘棋的一子一着。它们常常具有“牵一发而动全身”的性质。对于这些合同，必须严肃对待，必须如期如质如量地完成。
    在执行合同过程中，可能会碰到一些困难。这就需要本着小局服从大局和舍己为人的精神，克服各种困难来坚决完成任务。大连工矿车辆厂提出要“处处为用户着想”，实质上就是为全局着想。这种精神是值得提倡的。
    会下棋的人都懂得，全局的胜利要靠每一着每一个子贯彻统一的意图来实现。各个单位都严格履行合同，使子子有着落，着着击中要害，全棋就能稳操胜券了。
