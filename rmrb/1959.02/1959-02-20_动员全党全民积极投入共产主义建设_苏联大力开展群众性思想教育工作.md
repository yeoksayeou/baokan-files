    The CPSU Central Committee Issues Instructions on Deeply Studying the Documents of the Party Congress
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th - In order to mobilize the people of the whole country, all communists to actively participate in communist construction, the Soviet Union is launching a nationwide mass ideological education campaign.
    According to the latest issue of "Party Life" magazine, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has passed an instruction on studying and publicizing the documents and resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU. The instruction suggests that the party organizations of various republics, states, and districts organize all party members and the entire people to deeply study the documents of this congress. The instruction requires party organizations at all levels to vigorously carry out the party's political work among the masses, so as to mobilize the entire people to realize the Seven-Year Plan.
    The instruction points out that the mass political work of party organizations in the near future should be: focusing on publicizing the Soviet Union's historical achievements, the main tasks of the Seven-Year Plan, the significance of the Seven-Year Plan in the peaceful competition with capitalist countries, the laws of the transition from socialism to communism, and the party's leading role in communist construction. The instruction emphasizes that in organizing mass propaganda and education, attention should be paid to linking the Seven-Year Plan with the actual conditions of each agricultural cooperative and enterprise.
    The instruction says that actively publicizing and interpreting the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the Party is the responsibility of every communist. Every leader of the Party and government, economic departments, the Communist Youth League, and trade unions should personally participate in this work.
    The instruction points out that the party's educational institutions at all levels must list the study of the "Twenty-First Congress" documents as the central task in this academic year, and the most important thing at present is to study the new things that the Congress has brought to Marxist-Leninist theory and communist practice. All colleges and universities in the country should also study the various documents of the Congress. This study will be an important way to bring schools closer to life and closer to communist construction.

    动员全党全民积极投入共产主义建设
    苏联大力开展群众性思想教育工作
    苏共中央发出关于深入学习党代会文件的指示
    新华社莫斯科19日电　为了动员全国人民、所有的共产党员积极投入共产主义建设，苏联正在开始进行全国规模的群众性的思想教育工作。
    据“党的生活”杂志最近一期报道，苏联共产党中央委员会已经通过了一个研究和宣传苏共第二十一次代表大会的文件和决议的指示。这项指示建议各共和国、州、区的党组织组织全体党员和全体人民深入学习这次代表大会的各项文件。这项指示要求各级党组织在群众中大力开展党的政治工作，以动员全体人民实现七年计划。
    指示指出，党组织最近时期的群众政治工作应该是：集中宣传苏联的历史性成就、七年计划的主要任务、七年计划在同资本主义国家和平竞赛中的意义、从社会主义过渡到共产主义的规律以及党在共产主义建设中的领导作用。指示强调说，在组织群众的宣传教育工作中，应注意把七年计划同各个农庄、企业的实际联系起来。
    指示说，积极宣传解释党的第二十一次代表大会的决议是每个共产党员的责任。党和政府、经济机关、共青团、工会的每个领导人都应该亲自参加这一工作。
    指示指出，各级党的教育学习机构在本学年中必须把学习“二十一大”的文件列为中心任务，目前最主要的是研究代表大会给马克思列宁主义理论和共产主义实践带来的新的东西。全国各高等学校也要学习代表大会的各项文件。这一学习将是使学校接近生活、接近共产主义建设的一个重要方法。
