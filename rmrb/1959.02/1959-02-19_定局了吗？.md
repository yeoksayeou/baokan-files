Is it a Foregone Conclusion?
Gong Jie

In the south, spring arrives early, and wheat and rapeseed are already growing very luxuriantly. In vast areas, commune members are, in the brilliant spring sunshine, exerting all their energy and striving for the top, to fight the first battle of this year's great leap forward in agriculture—striving for a bumper harvest of spring crops. However, there are also some people who believe that the harvest of these crops is "a foregone conclusion," and further cultivation is a waste of effort. Is it really a foregone conclusion? No. Not only is it not a foregone conclusion, but there is also much that can be done. The sowing of spring crops this year was generally earlier than in previous years, and deep plowing and close planting were generally practiced, which are favorable conditions for striving for an even greater bumper harvest this year. However, this does not mean that with these favorable conditions, we can sit back and wait for an even greater harvest. Strengthening cultivation and management can add to the good; relaxing cultivation and management can also lead to the abandonment of previous efforts.

Now, in these areas, is it too late to cultivate and manage spring crops? It is not too late. Spring has just arrived, and there is still more than a month before the wheat heads and the rapeseed flowers. Now is the time when wheat and rapeseed are growing vigorously. The good harvest of spring crops in many places last year was mainly due to the efforts in field management at this time. The cultivation and management of spring crops such as rapeseed and wheat mainly involve topdressing. Taking the situation in Hunan as an example, at least three topdressings can still be applied from now on: one for welcoming-spring fertilizer, one for jointing (wheat) and bolting (rapeseed) fertilizer, and one for ear-elongation fertilizer. In addition, it is also necessary to clear ditches for drainage, cultivate in time, and prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests. At present, there is still a lot that can be done to strive for a bumper harvest of spring crops.

The growth of crops has its natural laws. Foregone conclusion or not foregone conclusion is an objective matter. Cultivation is precisely the way to bring into play people's subjective initiative in accordance with natural laws. Chenxi County in Hunan Province mobilized the masses to refute the "foregone conclusion theory" and strengthened the field management of early spring crops like embroidery. The people of the county are striving for a wheat yield of 1,000 catties per mu and a rapeseed yield of 400 catties per mu, which is a vivid example.

In some areas of the south, some people neglect the field management of spring crops because they underestimate them. They believe that these crops are not the most important crops of the year and are insignificant. Is it really insignificant? Let's calculate: it is possible to increase the yield by dozens or even hundreds of catties per mu by making an effort now. Taking Hunan as an example, in addition to 6 million mu of rapeseed, there are 6.4 million mu of spring crops such as wheat and broad beans; in addition, it is also planned to expand the planting of spring corn and spring buckwheat by 1.6 million mu. In this way, there will be 8 million mu of spring grain crops. If the yield per mu is increased by 50 catties, 400 million catties of grain can be added; if the yield per mu is increased by 100 catties, 800 million catties can be added. Isn't this still considerable!

The sowing quality of rapeseed this year is better than in any previous year. As long as we grasp field management, we can strive for a greater bumper harvest of rapeseed.

### 定局了吗？

    定局了吗？
    龚杰
    南方春早，麦子、油菜已经生长得非常茂盛。广大地区的公社社员正在灿烂的春光里，鼓足干劲，力争上游，要打好今年农业大跃进的第一仗，——争取春收作物的大丰收。但是，也有一部分人，认为这些作物的收成“已成定局”，再加工培育，也是空费力气了。是否真的定局了呢？没有。不但没有定局，而且大有可为。今年春收作物的播种一般比往年要早，并且一般实行了深耕密植，这是争取今年更大丰收的有利条件。可是，这并不是说，有了这些有利条件，就可以坐等更大的丰收了。加强培育管理，就可以锦上添花；放松了培育管理，也有前功尽弃的可能。
    现在，在这些地区，培育管理春收作物是不是已经迟了？不迟。春天刚到，距麦子孕穗、油菜开花还有一个多月时间。现在正是麦子、油菜生长旺盛的时候。去年许多地方的春收作物收成好，重要原因就是在这个时候在田间管理方面加了劲。油菜、麦子等春收作物的培育管理工作，主要是追肥。以湖南的情形来看，从现在起最低限度还可以追三次肥：一次迎春肥，一次拔节（麦子）抽苔（油菜）肥，一次长穗肥。此外，还需要及时清沟排水、中耕、防治病虫害。目前，在争取春收作物的丰收方面可以做的事情还多得很。
    农作物的生长是有它的自然规律的，定局和没有定局，是客观的事情。加工培育，正是按照自然规律来发挥人们的主观能动作用。湖南省辰溪县发动群众，驳倒“定局论”，像绣花一样加强小春田间管理，全县人民正力争小麦亩产一千斤，油菜亩产四百斤，就是一个生动的例证。
    在南方有些地区，有人忽视春收作物的田间管理，是因为小看春收作物。他们认为，这些作物不是一年中最主要的作物，无足轻重。是不是真的无足轻重呢？不妨计算一下：现在加一把劲每亩多产几十斤以至百把斤，是可能做到的。以湖南为例，除六百万亩油菜外，麦子、蚕豆等春收作物有六百四十万亩；此外，还准备扩种春玉米、春荞麦一百六十万亩。这样，春收粮食作物就有八百万亩。如果每亩产量提高五十斤，就可以增加四亿斤粮食；如果每亩产量提高一百斤，就可以增加八亿斤。这难道还不可观吗！
    今年油菜播种质量比以往任何一年都好，只要抓紧田间管理，就能争取油菜更大丰收。
