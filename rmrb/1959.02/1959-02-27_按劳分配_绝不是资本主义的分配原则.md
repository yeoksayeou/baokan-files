"Distribution According to Labor" is Absolutely Not a Capitalist Distribution Principle
Wu Jiapei
    In the discussion article "Talking Again About Eliminating Bourgeois Rights," Comrade Zheng Jiqiao, in order to argue that distribution according to labor is a bourgeois right, actually regards distribution according to labor as a capitalist distribution principle. He said: "In terms of the direct relationship between capitalists and workers, the amount of wages they pay to this or that worker is, in principle, measured by the worker's labor, that is, 'how much work is done, how much money is given,' either calculated by labor days or by the quantity of products, more work gets more, and less work gets less." He also said: "The main difference between capitalism and communism, these two opposing societies, lies in the ownership of the means of production and the principles of social distribution. One is the private ownership of the means of production, and the other is the public ownership of the means of production; one distributes according to the amount of labor people put in, and the other distributes according to people's needs." The author believes that socialist society "on the one hand, eliminates the private ownership of the means of production, the most fundamental thing in bourgeois rights; on the other hand, it retains the 'equal' principle of bourgeois rights that uses labor as a measure, that is, 'distribution according to labor,' in the main distribution principle." Therefore, the conclusion is that "it cannot be said that distribution according to labor is the negation of capitalist distribution principles or the negation of bourgeois rights." (Emphasis added by the translator)
    I believe that the above view is not only theoretically wrong, but also politically harmful.
    First, Comrade Zheng Jiqiao mistakenly describes distribution according to labor as being above class, as a distribution principle shared by capitalism and socialism, two societies with fundamentally different natures.
    Marxist political economy always includes the form of product distribution, together with the ownership of the means of production that determines this form, as well as the position and mutual relationship of people in production arising from it, within the social relations of production. Engels said in "Anti-Dühring": "Distribution, in its main points, is always a necessary result of the production relations and exchange relations of that society, as well as the historical premises of that society. Knowing the latter, one can certainly deduce the distribution method that dominates within that society." What kind of mode of production, what kind of form of distribution. A certain form of distribution in history is always adapted to a certain mode of production. It is unimaginable for two different modes of production to share one form of distribution. Only bourgeois economists, in order to conceal the sharp contradictions between the product distribution system created by the capitalist mode of production and the mode of production itself, will explain distribution as something that does not depend on the mode of production.
    As everyone knows, distribution according to labor is an economic law inherent in socialist society, and its existence and functioning are premised on the public ownership of the means of production. In capitalist society, capitalists occupy all the means of production. Under the threat of hunger, workers are forced to sell their labor and endure capitalist exploitation. The little wages that workers receive are nothing more than the price of labor, which, like the price of other commodities, is subject to the law of value. Therefore, the distribution relationship under the capitalist system embodies the exploitation relationship of the bourgeoisie over the working class, and it is subordinate to the capitalist law of surplus value. In such a society, it is fundamentally impossible to distribute products among producers according to the quantity and quality of labor. Only in socialist society, because the means of production are public property, and producers become the masters of the means of production, their labor is no longer sold as a commodity, and free labor for themselves and for society replaces forced exploitative wage labor, distribution according to "work" becomes possible, and labor becomes the measure for distributing products for the first time. If the socialist public ownership of the means of production guarantees the possibility of carrying out distribution according to labor, then the level of productive forces in the socialist stage has not yet created a great abundance of social products that would make distribution according to need a reality, the remnants of capitalist ideology in people's minds, the old social division of labor, and the various differences in labor have not been completely eliminated, which makes distribution according to labor objectively necessary. Although distribution according to labor has not completely overcome the "narrow horizon of bourgeois right" and may make some people "nitpick and unwilling to work half an hour more than others, unwilling to get a little less remuneration than others," these inevitable "shortcomings" are not enough to affect its socialist nature.
    In the book "State and Revolution," Lenin directly called "receiving equal products for equal labor" and "he who does not work, neither shall he eat" "socialist principles." Party resolutions also clearly tell us, "The socialist principle is 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his work'." Failing to recognize this and saying that "distribution according to labor" is something that already exists in capitalist society is equivalent to negating the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system in terms of distribution.
    Comrade Zheng Jiqiao mistakenly believes that the amount of wages capitalists pay to workers is, in principle, measured by the worker's labor, that is, "how much work is done, how much money is given," either calculated by labor days or by the quantity of products, more work gets more, and less work gets less. This is equivalent to saying that capitalists are "distributing" consumer goods among workers according to the quantity and quality of their labor. Comrade Zheng Jiqiao is completely deceived by the transformation of the value of labor into the price of labor, that is, the capitalist wage form (time wages and piece-rate wages), and cannot see the real class relations hidden behind this superficial phenomenon. All the defensive empty talk of bourgeois vulgar economics is precisely based on the aforementioned smokescreen. It is true that in capitalist society, workers participating in production participate in the distribution of the results of social production in the form of wages. However, it must not be forgotten that this wage is premised on wage labor, and what it reflects is by no means the capitalist's "distribution according to labor" relationship to the working masses, but rather an exploitative relationship that takes the form of purchasing the special commodity of labor and occupying surplus labor without compensation. Marx said in "Wage Labour and Capital": "Wages are not the share of the worker in the commodities produced by him. Wages are that part of already existing commodities with which the capitalist buys a definite amount of productive labour-power." Perhaps there will be the following defense: a worker with a high degree of labor skill or who expends a lot of labor intensity, whether in capitalist or socialist society, will always get a certain amount of wages more than another worker with a low degree of labor skill or who expends a little labor intensity. Doesn't this mean that the "tool" of "distribution according to labor" is not only used by the working class in a leading position, but also used by capitalists? Socialist society implements "more work, more pay; less work, less pay," and capitalist society also implements "more work, more give; less work, less give." What is the difference between the two? This defense is not worth refuting. As everyone knows, under the capitalist system, piece-rate wages are the transformed form of time wages, and time wages are nothing more than the transformed form of the value or price of labor. On the basis of wage labor, the value of labor, like the value of all other commodities, different labor has different values. Because their reproduction requires different production costs, in the labor market, they will and should receive different remuneration according to different prices, some giving more, some giving less. Obviously, unlike the distribution situation in socialist society, workers do not obtain wages based on the labor they realize, because after he sells his labor and starts to realize labor, the labor no longer belongs to him. Here, the decisive factor is by no means the law of "distribution according to labor," but rather the general laws of capitalism that govern commodity prices. In fact, even if a worker tries to intensify his labor, work a few more hours, or produce more products in an hour, in order to maintain his general wage level, he will not get more wages. Marx said that as competition intensifies and the bad effects of the division of labor are strengthened, the result is: "The more he works, the less wages he gets." With the strengthening of the role of the capitalist law of accumulation, the share of the working class in the national income is becoming less and less, and they are becoming poorer not only relatively but also absolutely. The impoverished situation of the working class cannot be changed by the comfort of more work can get more, only by carrying out a socialist revolution, expropriating the few expropriators, can the working class enter paradise of socialism-communism from the hell of capitalism. Instilling in workers under the capitalist system the idea of so-called distribution according to labor of "more work, more give; less work, less give" can have no other consequence than helping the bourgeoisie corrupt the revolutionary consciousness of the working class.
    In Comrade Zheng Jiqiao's article, not a single word is mentioned about the principle of distribution according to capital income in capitalist society. As mentioned earlier, under the capitalist system, the distribution of products is determined by the concentration of the means of production in the hands of capitalists. Workers rely on selling their labor to obtain labor income; capitalists rely on capital to exploit workers' labor to obtain non-labor income. The division of the surplus value created by workers among capitalists is also measured by the amount of capital, and the principle of distribution according to capital is commonly used. In contrast, under the socialist system, the liberated working class implements the principle of distribution according to labor within itself. Since it is admitted that unearned income, more work less income, and even labor without income are distribution phenomena in capitalist society (although not unique to capitalist society), one should not draw the following conclusion: the product distribution in capitalist society is also measured by people's labor. To insist that the socialist principle of distributing products according to labor has already emerged in capitalist society, what other meaning can this have besides putting lipstick on capitalist society?

    “按劳分配”绝不是资本主义的分配原则
    乌家培
    在“再谈削除资产阶级法权”的讨论性文章中，郑季翘同志为了论证按劳分配乃是资产阶级法权这个观点，竟把按劳分配视为资本主义的分配原则。他说：“就资本家与工人的直接关系来说，他们付给这个工人或那个工人多少工资，原则上则是以工人的劳动为尺度，即‘做多少活、给多少钱’，或以劳动日计，或以产品数量计，多做多给，少做少给。”又说：“资本主义和共产主义这两个对立的社会之所以对立，主要的表现在生产资料所有制和社会的分配原则上。一个是生产资料私有制，另一个是生产资料公有制；一个是以人们的劳动为尺度来进行分配，另一个是按人们的需要来进行分配。”作者认为，社会主义社会“一方面取消了生产资料的私人所有制即资产阶级法权中最根本的东西；另一方面则在主要的分配原则上保留了资产阶级法权中以劳动为尺度的‘平等’原则即‘按劳分配’”。因此，结论是“不能说按劳分配是资本主义分配原则的否定，或资产阶级法权的否定。”（着重点都是引者加的）
    我认为，上述观点不但在理论上是错误的，而且在政治上也是有害的。
    首先，郑季翘同志错误地将按劳分配说成是超阶级的，说成是资本主义和社会主义两个性质根本不同的社会所共有的分配原则。
    马克思主义的政治经济学，始终是把产品分配形式连同决定这种形式的生产资料所有制，以及由此而产生的人们在生产中的地位与相互关系一起包括在社会生产关系之内的。恩格斯在“反杜林论”中说：“分配在其主要点说来，总是该社会的生产关系和交换关系以及该社会历史前提的必然结果，知道了后者，就可以确实地推断出该社会内占支配地位的分配方式。”有甚么样的生产方式，便有甚么样的分配形式。历史上一定的分配形式总是同一定的生产方式相适应的。两种不同的生产方式共有一种分配形式，是不可想像的事情。只有资产阶级经济学家，为了掩盖资本主义生产方式所造成的产品分配制度同这一生产方式本身的尖锐矛盾，才会把分配解释成一种不依赖于生产方式的东西。
    大家知道，按劳分配是社会主义社会所固有的经济规律，它的存在和起作用是以生产资料的公有制为前提的。在资本主义社会里，资本家占有一切生产资料，由于饥饿的威胁，工人被迫出卖劳动力，承受资本的剥削。工人所得的一点工资，无非是劳动力的价格，它同其他商品的价格一样，要受价值规律的支配。所以，资本主义制度下的分配关系，体现着资产阶级对工人阶级的剥削关系，它从属于资本主义的剩余价值规律。在这样的社会里，根本不可能在生产者之间按照劳动的数量和质量来分配产品。只有在社会主义社会里，因为生产资料是公共的财产，生产者成了生产资料的主人，他们的劳动力不再作为商品而出卖，为自己为社会的自由劳动代替了强制的剥削的雇佣劳动，按“工作”进行分配才成了可能，劳动才第一次成为分配产品的尺度。如果说生产资料的社会主义公有制，保证了进行按劳分配的可能性，那末社会主义阶段还不能造成社会产品极大丰富而使按需分配成为事实的生产力发展水平，人们头脑中的资本主义思想残余，旧的社会分工和各种劳动的差别尚未能完全消灭等原因，则使按劳分配有了客观的必要性。尽管按劳分配还没有完全克服“资产阶级式法权的狭隘眼界”，还可能使一些人“斤斤计较，不愿比别人多做半小时工作，不愿比别人少得一点报酬。”但这些不可避免的“缺点”，并不足以影响它的社会主义性质。
    “国家与革命”一书里，列宁就直截了当地把“按等量劳动领取等量产品”和“不劳动不得食”叫作“社会主义原则”。党的决议也明白告诉我们，“社会主义原则是‘各尽所能、按劳分配’”。不认识这一点，把“按劳分配”说成是资本主义社会中就有的东西，就等于在无形中把社会主义制度在分配方面对于资本主义制度的无比优越性一笔勾销了。
    郑季翘同志错误地认为资本家付给工人工资的多少，原则上是以工人的劳动为尺度的，即“做多少活，给多少钱”，或以劳动日计，或以产品数量计，多做多给，少做少给。这等于说，资本家是按照工人劳动的数量和质量在工人之间“分配”消费品的。郑季翘同志完全被劳动力的价值转化为劳动的价格，即资本主义的工资形态（计时工资和计件工资）迷惑住了，一点看不到这种表面现象的背后所隐藏的真实的阶级关系。资产阶级庸俗经济学的一切辩护性空言正是建立在前述烟幕之上的。不错，在资本主义社会，参与于生产的工人，是以工资形式参与于社会生产成果的分配的。但是，不能忘记，这种工资是以雇佣劳动为前提的，它所反映的绝不是资本家对工人群众的“按劳分配”关系，而是以购买劳动力这个特殊商品为形式，无偿地占有剩余劳动的剥削关系。马克思在“雇佣劳动与资本”中说过：“工资不是工人在他所生产的商品中占有的一分。工资乃是原有商品中由资本家用以购买一定量生产劳动力的那一部分。”也许会有如下的辩解：一个劳动熟练程度高或者支出的劳动强度大的工人，无论在资本主义社会还是社会主义社会，总要比另一个劳动熟练程度低或者支出的劳动强度小的工人，多得一定数量的工资，这不是说“按劳分配”的“工具”不仅为居于领导地位的工人阶级所运用，同样也为资本家利用过吗？社会主义社会实行“多劳多得、少劳少得”，资本主义社会也实行“多做多给、少做少给”，两者之间又有什么差别呢？这种辩解是不值一驳的。大家知道，在资本主义制度下，计件工资是计时工资的转化形态，而计时工资又不外是劳动力价值或价格的转化形态。在雇佣劳动的基础上，劳动力的价值如同其他一切商品的价值一样，不同的劳动力具有不同的价值。因为它们的再生产需要不同的生产费用，所以在劳动市场上，它们就会也应当按照不同的价格获得不同的报酬，有的多给，有的少给。很明显，与社会主义社会的分配情况不同，工人并不是以其所实现的劳动为尺度来取得工资的，因为当他出卖劳动力之后，开始实现劳动时，劳动就不是属于他的了。在这里，起支配作用的决不是“按劳分配”规律，而是支配着商品价格的资本主义的一般规律。事实上，即或工人力求用加紧劳动的办法，多做几小时工作，或者在一小时内多制出些产品，以便维持自己的一般工资数量，也不会多得工资。马克思说，由于竞争愈激烈，劳动分工的坏影响愈加强，结果是：“他工作得愈多，他所得的工资也愈少。”随着资本主义积累规律作用的加强，工人阶级在国民收入中所占的份额越来越少了，他们不但相对地而且绝对地贫困化了。工人阶级的贫困境遇是不能用多劳可以多得的安慰来改变的，只有进行社会主义革命，剥夺少数剥夺者，工人阶级才能从资本主义的地狱进入社会主义——共产主义的天堂。向资本主义制度下的工人灌输“多做多给、少做少给”的所谓以劳动为尺度进行分配的思想，除了帮助资产阶级腐蚀工人阶级的革命意识之外，不可能有别的后果。
    在郑季翘同志的文章中，一句话都没有提到过资本主义社会按资本分配收入的原则。前面说过，在资本主义制度下，产品的分配是由生产资料集中在资本家手中这一点决定的。工人依靠出卖劳动力，取得劳动收入；资本家则依靠资本剥削工人劳动，取得非劳动收入。在资本家之间瓜分工人所创造的剩余价值，也是以资本额为尺度的，通用着按资本进行分配的原则。与此相对立，在社会主义制度下，解放了的工人阶级在其内部实行着按劳动进行分配的原则。既然承认不劳而获、多劳少获、甚至劳而不获是资本主义社会的分配现象（虽非资本主义社会所特有），就不应该得出如下的结论：资本主义社会的产品分配，也是以人们的劳动为尺度的。硬说社会主义按劳分配产品的原则在资本主义社会里就已经产生，这除了给资本主义社会擦脂抹粉之外，还能有其他意义吗？
