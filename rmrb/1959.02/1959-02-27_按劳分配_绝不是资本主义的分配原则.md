"Distribution According to Labor" is Absolutely Not a Capitalist Distribution Principle
Wu Jiapei
    In the discussion article "Talking Again About Eliminating Bourgeois Rights," Comrade Zheng Jiqiao, in order to argue that distribution according to labor is a bourgeois right, actually regards distribution according to labor as a capitalist distribution principle. He said: "In terms of the direct relationship between capitalists and workers, the amount of wages they pay to this or that worker is, in principle, measured by the worker's labor, that is, 'how much work is done, how much money is given,' either calculated by labor days or by the quantity of products, more work gets more, and less work gets less." He also said: "The main difference between capitalism and communism, these two opposing societies, lies in the ownership of the means of production and the principles of social distribution. One is the private ownership of the means of production, and the other is the public ownership of the means of production; one distributes according to the amount of labor people put in, and the other distributes according to people's needs." The author believes that socialist society "on the one hand, eliminates the private ownership of the means of production, the most fundamental thing in bourgeois rights; on the other hand, it retains the 'equal' principle of bourgeois rights that uses labor as a measure, that is, 'distribution according to labor,' in the main distribution principle." Therefore, the conclusion is that "it cannot be said that distribution according to labor is the negation of capitalist distribution principles or the negation of bourgeois rights." (Emphasis added by the translator)
    I believe that the above view is not only theoretically wrong, but also politically harmful.
    First, Comrade Zheng Jiqiao mistakenly describes distribution according to labor as being above class, as a distribution principle shared by capitalism and socialism, two societies with fundamentally different natures.
    Marxist political economy always includes the form of product distribution, together with the ownership of the means of production that determines this form, as well as the position and mutual relationship of people in production arising from it, within the social relations of production. Engels said in "Anti-DÃ¼hring": "Distribution, in its main points, is always a necessary result of the production relations and exchange relations of that society, as well as the historical premises of that society. Knowing the latter, one can certainly deduce the distribution method that dominates within that society." What kind of mode of production, what kind of form of distribution. A certain form of distribution in history is always adapted to a certain mode of production. It is unimaginable for two different modes of production to share one form of distribution. Only bourgeois economists, in order to conceal the sharp contradictions between the product distribution system created by the capitalist mode of production and the mode of production itself, will explain distribution as something that does not depend on the mode of production.
    As everyone knows, distribution according to labor is an economic law inherent in socialist society, and its existence and functioning are premised on the public ownership of the means of production. In capitalist society, capitalists occupy all the means of production. Under the threat of hunger, workers are forced to sell their labor and endure capitalist exploitation. The little wages that workers receive are nothing more than the price of labor, which, like the price of other commodities, is subject to the law of value. Therefore, the distribution relationship under the capitalist system embodies the exploitation relationship of the bourgeoisie over the working class, and it is subordinate to the capitalist law of surplus value. In such a society, it is fundamentally impossible to distribute products among producers according to the quantity and quality of labor. Only in socialist society, because the means of production are public property, and producers become the masters of the means of production, their labor is no longer sold as a commodity, and free labor for themselves and for society replaces forced exploitative wage labor, distribution according to "work" becomes possible, and labor becomes the measure for distributing products for the first time. If the socialist public ownership of the means of production guarantees the possibility of carrying out distribution according to labor, then the level of productive forces in the socialist stage has not yet created a great abundance of social products that would make distribution according to need a reality, the remnants of capitalist ideology in people's minds, the old social division of labor, and the various differences in labor have not been completely eliminated, which makes distribution according to labor objectively necessary. Although distribution according to labor has not completely overcome the "narrow horizon of bourgeois right" and may make some people "nitpick and unwilling to work half an hour more than others, unwilling to get a little less remuneration than others," these inevitable "shortcomings" are not enough to affect its socialist nature.
    In the book "State and Revolution," Lenin directly called "receiving equal products for equal labor" and "he who does not work, neither shall he eat" "socialist principles." Party resolutions also clearly tell us, "The socialist principle is 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his work'." Failing to recognize this and saying that "distribution according to labor" is something that already exists in capitalist society is equivalent to negating the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system in terms of distribution.
    Comrade Zheng Jiqiao mistakenly believes that the amount of wages capitalists pay to workers is, in principle, measured by the worker's labor, that is, "how much work is done, how much money is given," either calculated by labor days or by the quantity of products, more work gets more, and less work gets less. This is equivalent to saying that capitalists are "distributing" consumer goods among workers according to the quantity and quality of their labor. Comrade Zheng Jiqiao is completely deceived by the transformation of the value of labor into the price of labor, that is, the capitalist wage form (time wages and piece-rate wages), and cannot see the real class relations hidden behind this superficial phenomenon. All the defensive empty talk of bourgeois vulgar economics is precisely based on the aforementioned smokescreen. It is true that in capitalist society, workers participating in production participate in the distribution of the results of social production in the form of wages. However, it must not be forgotten that this wage is premised on wage labor, and what it reflects is by no means the capitalist's "distribution according to labor" relationship to the working masses, but rather an exploitative relationship that takes the form of purchasing the special commodity of labor and occupying surplus labor without compensation. Marx said in "Wage Labour and Capital": "Wages are not the share of the worker in the commodities produced by him. Wages are that part of already existing commodities with which the capitalist buys a definite amount of productive labour-power." Perhaps there will be the following defense: a worker with a high degree of labor skill or who expends a lot of labor intensity, whether in capitalist or socialist society, will always get a certain amount of wages more than another worker with a low degree of labor skill or who expends a little labor intensity. Doesn't this mean that the "tool" of "distribution according to labor" is not only used by the working class in a leading position, but also used by capitalists? Socialist society implements "more work, more pay; less work, less pay," and capitalist society also implements "more work, more give; less work, less give." What is the difference between the two? This defense is not worth refuting. As everyone knows, under the capitalist system, piece-rate wages are the transformed form of time wages, and time wages are nothing more than the transformed form of the value or price of labor. On the basis of wage labor, the value of labor, like the value of all other commodities, different labor has different values. Because their reproduction requires different production costs, in the labor market, they will and should receive different remuneration according to different prices, some giving more, some giving less. Obviously, unlike the distribution situation in socialist society, workers do not obtain wages based on the labor they realize, because after he sells his labor and starts to realize labor, the labor no longer belongs to him. Here, the decisive factor is by no means the law of "distribution according to labor," but rather the general laws of capitalism that govern commodity prices. In fact, even if a worker tries to intensify his labor, work a few more hours, or produce more products in an hour, in order to maintain his general wage level, he will not get more wages. Marx said that as competition intensifies and the bad effects of the division of labor are strengthened, the result is: "The more he works, the less wages he gets." With the strengthening of the role of the capitalist law of accumulation, the share of the working class in the national income is becoming less and less, and they are becoming poorer not only relatively but also absolutely. The impoverished situation of the working class cannot be changed by the comfort of more work can get more, only by carrying out a socialist revolution, expropriating the few expropriators, can the working class enter paradise of socialism-communism from the hell of capitalism. Instilling in workers under the capitalist system the idea of so-called distribution according to labor of "more work, more give; less work, less give" can have no other consequence than helping the bourgeoisie corrupt the revolutionary consciousness of the working class.
    In Comrade Zheng Jiqiao's article, not a single word is mentioned about the principle of distribution according to capital income in capitalist society. As mentioned earlier, under the capitalist system, the distribution of products is determined by the concentration of the means of production in the hands of capitalists. Workers rely on selling their labor to obtain labor income; capitalists rely on capital to exploit workers' labor to obtain non-labor income. The division of the surplus value created by workers among capitalists is also measured by the amount of capital, and the principle of distribution according to capital is commonly used. In contrast, under the socialist system, the liberated working class implements the principle of distribution according to labor within itself. Since it is admitted that unearned income, more work less income, and even labor without income are distribution phenomena in capitalist society (although not unique to capitalist society), one should not draw the following conclusion: the product distribution in capitalist society is also measured by people's labor. To insist that the socialist principle of distributing products according to labor has already emerged in capitalist society, what other meaning can this have besides putting lipstick on capitalist society?
