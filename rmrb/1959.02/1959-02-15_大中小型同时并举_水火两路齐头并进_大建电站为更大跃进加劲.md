Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 14th: The nationally renowned Danjiangkou Hydropower Station on the upper reaches of the Han River has entered a climax of full-scale construction.

This large-scale hydropower station, comparable to the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station on the Yellow River in terms of construction scale and power generation capacity, has completed the 2,000-meter-long right bank cofferdam project in just over a month since construction began last September. Currently, the builders are clearing the foundation, excavating, and pouring concrete, striving to pour the right bank dam to an elevation of over 90 meters in the first quarter. At the same time, preparations for the left bank cofferdam project are also being accelerated.

The Danjiangkou Hydropower Station has vigorously carried out mass movements, using a combination of indigenous and modern methods for construction, overcoming many difficulties and greatly accelerating the progress of the project. Take the right bank cofferdam as an example. According to the original design, not only was mechanized construction required, but also a large number of steel sheet piles. However, due to the current shortage of steel, the builders used earth, sand, and stone to build the cofferdam, which not only eliminated the need for steel sheet piles, but also completed the cofferdam in a much shorter time than originally planned. In order to better organize the construction climax, the relevant departments leading the project recently held a workers' representative meeting on the construction site. The workers' representatives put forward more than 1,000 rationalization proposals. The workers also launched a friendship competition.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 14th: The builders of the Xinfengjiang Hydropower Station in Guangdong are launching a high-efficiency competition, striving for the power station to start generating electricity ahead of schedule this year.

The installed capacity of the Xinfengjiang Hydropower Station is greater than the existing power generation capacity of Guangdong Province. The hydropower station has the functions of flood control, irrigation, and improving navigation. The power station was originally planned to generate electricity in 1961. In order to meet the needs of the leap-forward development of industrial and agricultural production, all employees are striving for the power station to generate electricity ahead of schedule this year. In the high-efficiency competition, the workers boldly improved various designs and construction plans, accelerating the construction progress. New records in breaking construction quotas are constantly emerging on the construction site. The workers in the first construction area who excavated the right bank dam foundation continuously created high-quota records of completing 3,000, 6,000, and 11,000 cubic meters per day, while originally only over 1,000 cubic meters were completed per day. The closure of the upstream cofferdam was originally estimated to take 24 hours to complete, but the workers actively rushed to work and completed it in only one and a half hours. According to the current construction progress, the powerhouse can be installed with hydraulic turbine generators in March.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 14th: Workers of all ethnic groups building the Xijin Hydropower Station in Guangxi are enthusiastically launching a technical innovation movement to ensure that the hydropower station generates electricity ahead of schedule.

The Xijin Hydropower Station is located near Xijin Village in Hengxian County along the Yu River, and is one of the large-scale hydropower stations in Guangxi along with the Zhaoping Hydropower Station. According to the construction plan, the entire project will be completed by the end of 1960. At that time, the electricity it generates, in addition to supplying Nanning City and nearby counties, can also be used as irrigation power, providing sufficient irrigation for 500,000 mu of farmland. Now, the workers building the hydropower station are fighting tensely to raise the cofferdam to the design height before the flood arrives in May and strive to generate electricity ahead of schedule at the end of the year. They launched a technical innovation movement to overcome the difficulties of insufficient construction machinery. In January alone, they put forward 883 rationalization proposals. The workers also reasonably modified the construction plan according to local conditions. For example, they changed the wooden cage cofferdam to a mixed earth, stone, and bamboo cage cofferdam, which saved materials and manpower, and advanced the construction of the main project by one month.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 14th: In front of Bailong Mountain in Liaoning Province, workers are building the large-scale Liaoning Power Plant with soaring enthusiasm and at a very fast speed. The civil engineering of the power plant's transmission network control room, chemical water treatment room, repair shop, material warehouse, oil depot, and two 100-meter-high large chimneys have all been completed. A main plant building, equivalent to 14 stories high and half a li long, has been basically completed two months ahead of schedule and is being installed with equipment. Soon, this power plant, built with the help of the German Democratic Republic, will have units put into production one after another, transmitting powerful electricity.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 14th: The Shenyang Tiexi Thermal Power Plant, which began construction in October last year, is expected to start generating electricity by the end of March or April this year. The workers building this thermal power plant have fought hard for more than three months in the freezing weather, making the power plant initially take shape. Its civil engineering is nearing completion, and the main plant building, cooling tower, chimney, main control room, etc., which are tens of meters high, have all stood up. Mechanical installation work has begun after the Spring Festival.

After the entire thermal power plant is completed, it will not only be able to generate huge amounts of electricity to meet the needs of the leap-forward in industrial production, but also provide a large amount of steam heat energy for many factories.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 14th: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is accelerating the development of the power industry.

In the western part of the autonomous region, the first and second units of the region's first high-temperature and high-pressure thermal power plant—Baotou No. 2 Thermal Power Plant—were put into production one after another in the second half of last year. The powerful electricity generated is supplying the construction of Baogang and supporting Hohhot City. Another large-scale thermal power plant serving Baogang—Baotou No. 1 Thermal Power Plant—is also accelerating the installation of power generation equipment and will soon be able to officially generate electricity. Both of these thermal power plants were designed by the Soviet Union to help our country.

In the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, the state and local authorities have invested separately in the construction and expansion of a number of large, medium, and small-scale power projects. The Hongshan Power Station in Zhaowuda League, invested by the state, has begun various preparatory work. Part of the new equipment at the expanded Chifeng City Power Plant has begun to generate electricity. Yakeshi, the main town in the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area, is also building a thermal power plant. The expanded thermal power plant in Ulanhot City has recently been put into production, increasing the city's power generation by more than two times. In addition, power plants in Manzhouli City and other places are actively expanding equipment and increasing power generation capacity.

The small-scale power industry in rural and pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia has also begun to show a vigorous new situation. According to incomplete statistics from the rural and pastoral areas of five leagues, including Zhaowuda and Hulunbuir, ethnic farmers and herdsmen built a total of 20 small hydropower stations in the high tide of water conservancy construction last year.

    据新华社武汉14日电　举国闻名的汉水上游丹江口水电站掀起了全面施工的高潮。
    这个建设规模和发电能力可以同黄河三门峡水电站比美的大型水电站，从去年9月动工以来，前后只用一个多月的时间，就完成了长达二千多公尺的右岸围堰工程。目前，建设者们正在清基开挖，浇灌混凝土，力争在第一季度内把右岸大坝浇灌到九十公尺高程以上。和这同时，左岸围堰工程的施工准备工作也已在加紧进行。
    丹江口水电站大搞群众运动，用土洋结合的办法施工，克服了许多困难，大大加速了工程进度。拿右岸围堰来说，按原设计不仅需要机械化施工，而且需要大量的钢板桩，但是当前钢材比较缺乏，建设者们便用土、砂、石做围堰，结果不但没有要钢板桩，而且在比原来规定要短得多的时间内把围堰筑好了。为了更好地组织施工高潮，最近，领导这一工程的有关部门在工地上召开了职工代表会议，职工代表共提出了合理化建议一千多件。职工们并且开展了友谊竞赛。
    据新华社广州14日电　广东新丰江水电站的建设者们正在开展高工效竞赛，力争电站提前在今年开始发电。
    新丰江水电站的装机容量比广东省现有的发电能力还要大。水电站具有防洪、灌溉和改善航运的作用。这个电站原计划在1961年发电，为了适应工农业生产飞跃发展的需要，全体职工力争电站提前在今年发电。职工们在高工效竞赛中，大胆地改进了各项设计和施工方案，加快了施工进度。工地上突破施工定额的新纪录不断涌现。第一工区开挖右岸坝基的职工们，连续创造了一天完成三千、六千、一万一千公方的高额纪录，而原来一天只完成一千多公方。上游围堰合龙，原来估计要二十四小时才能完成，但是职工们积极抢工，只用一个半小时就完成了。按照目前的施工进度，3月份内厂房就可以安装水轮发电机。
    据新华社南宁14日电　建设广西西津水电站的各族职工，正在热烈展开技术革新运动，保证让水电站提前发电。
  西津水电站位于郁江沿岸的横县西津村附近，和昭平水电站同为广西的大型水电站。按照施工计划，全部工程将在1960年底完成，那时，它所发出的电力，除了供应南宁市及附近的县份以外，还可以作灌溉动力，使五十万亩农田得到充足的灌溉。现在，建设水电站的职工，正为在5月洪水到来前把围堰加高到设计高度和力争提前在年底发电而紧张地战斗。他们开展技术革新运动，克服施工机械不足的困难，仅今年1月份，他们就提出合理化建议八百八十三件。职工们还根据当地条件，合理地修改施工方案。如把木笼围堰改为土石竹笼混合围堰，既省材料，又省人力，使主体工程施工提前了一个月。
    据新华社沈阳14日电　在辽宁省白龙山前，工人们正以冲天的干劲，以很快的速度，建设规模巨大的辽宁电厂。电厂的输电网路控制室、化学水处理室、修配厂、材料库、油库和两座百公尺高的大烟筒的土建工程都已完成，一座相当于十四层楼高、半华里长的主厂房，比原计划提前两个月基本建成，正在安装设备。不久以后，这座由德意志民主共和国帮助建设的电厂，就将陆续有机组投入生产，输送出强大的电力。
    据新华社沈阳14日电　去年10月动工兴建的沈阳铁西热电站，预计今年3月底或4月份内就可以开始发电。建设这座热电站的职工，在冰天雪地里奋战三个多月，已使电站初具雏型。它的土建工程接近尾声，几十公尺高的主厂房、冷水塔、烟囱、主控制室等，都已矗立起来。机械安装工作已在春节后开始。
    这座热电站全部建成后，不仅能够发出巨大的电量供应工业生产跃进的需要，还将为许多工厂提供大量的蒸气热能。
    据新华社呼和浩特14日电　内蒙古自治区加速发展电力工业。
    在自治区西部，全区的第一座高温高压热电厂——包头第二热电厂的第一台机组和第二台机组，已在去年下半年先后投入生产，发出的强大的电力正供应包钢建设，并支援呼和浩特市。另一座为包钢服务的大型热电厂——包头第一热电厂，最近也在加速安装发电设备，不久以后就可以正式发电。这两座热电厂都是苏联帮助我国设计的。
    在内蒙古东部地区，国家和地方分别投资兴建和扩建一批大、中、小型电力工程。由国家投资的昭乌达盟红山电站，已开始进行各项筹建工作。扩建的赤峰市发电厂，已有一部分新设备开始发电。大兴安岭林区的主要城镇牙克石，也在建设一座热电站。乌兰浩特市扩建的火力发电厂，最近投入了生产，使全市发电量骤增两倍多。此外，满洲里市等地发电厂都在积极扩充设备，提高发电能力。
    内蒙古农村、牧区的小型电力工业，也开始呈现出蓬勃发展的新形势。据昭乌达、呼伦贝尔等五个盟的农村、牧区不完全统计，去年各族农牧民在水利建设高潮中建成的小型水电站共有二十座。（附图片）
