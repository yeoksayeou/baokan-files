Competing in Speed with the Double-Track Project
By our reporters Shou Keng and Shi Tao

Towards the end of January, the train ferry being built by the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai entered its most intense construction phase before launching.

Last year, the shipbuilding workers, who had built a 5,000-ton freighter in a stunning five months and twelve days, launched an increasingly fierce battle against time after sending the first section of the ferry's hull onto the slipway on January 8th. The workers deeply understand that transportation, this "vanguard," bears an even greater task this year, and the rapidly advancing Jinpu and Huning double-track projects urgently need the ferry. They are determined to compete in speed with the double-track project, to get the ferry out of the factory as soon as possible, so that more trains can carry goods from the north and south across the Yangtze River.

One evening, we visited the heroic shipbuilding workers.

After the rain, thick clouds hung low over the Huangpu River, and the cold wind whistled. On the slipway by the river, the massive body of the ferry lay horizontally. Far and near, there was the rapid, deafening roar of pneumatic guns everywhere. In the dazzling, pale blue light of electric welding arcs, the welders appeared squatting, lying prostrate, and lying on their backs, working hard. People are carrying out the final closing works of the hull.

Crossing the crisscrossing oxygen pipes and climbing the winding ladders, we came to the deck. Here, it is difficult to ask the workers to take a little time to talk. They work so intently that they do not even notice when someone passes by. The enthusiastic workshop union chairman, who accompanied us on the visit, tried to bring two workers over. They seemed to have been dragged over reluctantly, and both were eager to say a few words and go back. In such an occasion, the visitors are clearly unwelcome. We can only end the conversation quickly.

We decided to interview a few workers specifically, seizing the opportunity to talk to them for a word or two. At the stern end, we found the Xu Qixiang electric welding team. These young men were welding the "beauty frame" of the propeller shaft tube, which is a crucial project for launching the ferry ahead of schedule. The party branch held an emergency meeting that day, requiring completion by 11:00 p.m. the next day, shortening the time by half compared to usual. We asked the workers, "Is it possible?" The answer was firm and bold: "No problem." Here, the river wind is sharp, and the workers weld and knock away without any concern. The Xu Qixiang team is an excellent electric welding team, never afraid of difficulties in their work. In the severe cold of minus eight degrees a few days ago, they still worked outdoors all night, and in the morning when they got off work, their hats and backs were covered with white frost; when the rain poured down, they used umbrellas or small oilcloth to cover the welding area, preventing rainwater from entering and ensuring the quality of the electric welding, while they preferred to endure the rain themselves.

We also found the excellent fitter Yan Chunhui. This young man, whose grandfather and father were both shipbuilders, was standing on the scaffolding next to the anchor chain tube, buried in his work. His face was covered with oil stains, and his voice was a little hoarse due to continuous hard work. We asked, "Tired?" He smiled and shook his head, and immediately turned around to work again. Yan Chunhui is not only full of energy, but also a skilled worker. Last Saturday night, he worked until 1:00 a.m., and came to the factory early on Sunday morning. That day, a section of the hull was hoisted onto the slipway and needed to be joined with other parts. In order to save time, he did not go home that night, climbing up and down the slipway, measuring this and measuring that, and came up with a new method of assembling the hull. Joining the two sections of the hull originally required two corrections for positioning, but this time he put the two sections of the hull together and positioned them at once, shortening the working hours by half.

On the track next to the slipway, a tall crane drove up, like a mobile ten-story building. The huge arm followed the hand gestures of the crane operator on the deck, slowly unloading a piece of steel plate hanging down. We looked up and saw that the young female worker was operating the crane high in the cab. This is another front in the slipway battle. Heroes have emerged from among them as well. The porter Liu Weijin jumped into the Huangpu River in the winter night to retrieve the handling tools that were swept into the river by the tide in order to deliver the wood needed for the ferry in time. His touching story was published in the factory's "Jiangnan Worker" newspaper.

While accompanying us on the visit, the chairman of the trade union told us intermittently that "forcing" the workers to sleep well and eat well is now an important task of the factory's party organization and trade union. The workshop party branch has to discuss this issue at every meeting. But how difficult it is to persuade the workers to rest. If you ask him to go to sleep, some workers smile and pretend they didn't hear; some agree verbally, but when you look again after a while, they are still there. Even "quarrels" occur in order to persuade workers to rest. Section chief Yang Guangen asked the workers to go home to sleep, but the other party asked back righteously: "Why don't you get off the ship yourself?" Yang Guangen was speechless, he had indeed been staying on the slipway all the time, and he hadn't even had time to shave his beard. Electric welder Cai Zuxin, air cutter Zhang Jinlin, and outside fireman Tang Jinxiang were not feeling well, and the doctors at the workshop health station issued them sick leave slips, but they secretly stuffed them into their pockets, not letting others know. When the chairman of the trade union said these words, his tone was full of pride in the soaring enthusiasm of the workers, while also revealing a kind of helpless expression.

When we left the slipway, we looked again at the row of large-character slogans hanging there: "Seize sunny days, grab rainy days, conquer severe cold, overcome difficulties, and ensure that the train ferry is launched before February 7th!" At this time, we understood the meaning of these bold words of the workers even more. We thought in our hearts that this train ferry with a displacement of 5,100 tons, which is even larger than the "Shanghai" ferry built by this factory last year, will definitely be launched within a month as the workers said. In this way, the slipway cycle will be shortened by more than nine months compared with "Shanghai."

Heroic shipbuilding workers, please accept our deep respect as ordinary visitors.

    和复线工程比速度
    本报记者　寿铿　世涛
    1月末梢，上海江南造船厂建造的火车渡轮，进入下水前施工最紧张的时刻。
    去年曾经以五个月十二天的惊人速度建成载重五千吨海轮的造船工人，1月8日把渡轮的第一段船体送上船台以后，抢时间的战斗就越来越猛烈。工人们深深懂得：运输这个“先行官”今年承担着更大的任务，进展神速的津浦、沪宁复线工程迫切需要渡轮。他们决心和复线工程比速度，使渡轮早日出厂，让更多的列车载运大江南北的货物横渡长江。
    一天晚上，我们访问了英雄的造船工人。
    雨后的黄浦江上空，浓云低垂，寒风唿唿。临江的船台上，横卧着渡轮的庞大身躯。远远近近，到处是冷风枪急遽的、震耳的轰鸣。在眩目的、淡蓝色的电焊弧光中，显现出焊接工们蹲着、伏着、仰躺着紧张劳动的景象。人们正在进行船体的最后合拢工程。
    越过纵横交错的氧气管，登上曲折盘绕的扶梯，我们来到甲板上。在这里，要想请工人们抽出一点时间谈话，是一件困难的事情。他们工作得那么专注，有人走过身旁也没有觉察。陪同我们访问的热情的车间工会主席，尝试着请来了两位工人。他们看来是勉强被拖来的，都争着想先讲几句就回去。在这样的场合，访问者显然是不被欢迎的人。我们只能把谈话赶紧结束。
    我们决定专访几个工人，抓机会跟他们谈一、二句话。在船尾的那一端，我们找到了徐启祥电焊工小组。这群小伙子正在焊接装置推进器地轴轴管的“美人架”，这是渡轮提前下水的一个关键性工程。党总支这天开了紧急会议，要求在次日晚上十一时完工，比通常缩短一半时间。我们向工人探问：“能行吗？”回答是坚决而豪迈：“没有问题。”这里江风尖峭，工人们焊的焊，敲的敲，毫不介意。徐启祥小组是一个出色的电焊工小组，工作中从来不畏艰难。在前几天零下八度的严寒里，他们照样整夜露天作业，早晨下班，帽上、背上都积上了白霜；大雨倾盆的时候，他们用雨伞或者小小的油布遮住焊接的部位，不让雨水浸入，保证电焊质量，而自己宁可挨受雨淋。
    我们又找了出色的装配工严纯辉。这个祖父、父亲都是造船工人的年青人，这时正站在锚链筒旁边的脚手架上埋头操作。他满脸油污，因为接连的紧张劳动，嗓子有点暗哑。我们问：“累了吧？”他笑笑摇摇头，又立刻转身工作。严纯辉不但干劲足，又是巧干的能手。上个星期六晚上他干到深夜一点钟，星期日一早又到厂里来了。这天有一段船体吊上船台，需要同其他部分合拢。他为了抢时间，当天晚上又没有回家，在船台上爬上爬下，测量这测量那，想出了一个装配船体的新办法。两段船体接起来原来需要经过两次校正，进行定位，这次他把两段船体套起来，一次定位，缩短了一半工时。
    船台旁边的轨道上，开来了一架高大的起重机，像一幢活动的十几层楼的大厦。巨大的臂膀跟着甲板上领车工的手势，缓缓地把吊着的一块钢板卸下。我们仰头一望，高坐在驾驶室里操纵起重机的是一个青年女工。这是船台战斗的另一条战线。他们中也是英雄辈出。搬运工刘维金为了及时运到渡轮需要的木料，冬夜跳入黄浦江，在寒冷彻骨的江水中打捞被潮水卷入江中的搬运工具。他的动人事迹被登在工厂出版的“江南工人”报上。
    工会主席一面陪我们访问，一面断断续续地告诉我们，“强逼”工人们睡好吃好，现在已经是工厂党组织和工会的一项重要工作。车间党总支每次开会都要讨论这个问题。但是劝工人们休息又是多么困难。你要他去睡觉，有的工人笑笑，当作没听见；有的嘴巴上答应了，停会儿去看仍然在那里。为了劝工人休息，甚至发生“吵架”。工段长杨关根要工人回家睡觉，对方理直气壮地反问：“你自己为什么不下船？”杨关根哑口无言，他确实一直耽在船台上，连胡子长了也没功夫剃。电焊工蔡祖新、风割工张金林、外火工唐金祥身体不舒服，车间保健站的医师给他们开了请假证明条子，但他们偷偷地往口袋里一塞，不让别人知道。工会主席说这些话的时候，语调中充满了对工人冲天干劲的骄傲，同时又流露出一种无可奈何的神情。
    离开船台的时候，我们再一次看看挂在那里的一排大字标语：“抓晴天，抢雨天，征服严寒，战胜困难，保证火车渡轮2月7日前下水！”这时候，我们更加懂得工人们这些豪言壮语的意义了。我们心里想，这艘排水量五千一百吨，比这个厂去年造成的“上海号”渡轮还大的火车渡轮，一定能够像工人们所说的在一个月内下水。这样，船台周期就比“上海号”缩短了九个多月。
    英雄的造船工人们，请接受我们作为普通访问者的深挚的敬意。
