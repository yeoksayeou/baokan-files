Hebei Province Launches a Crash Campaign to Pick Up and Purchase Cotton and Oil-Bearing Crops

Tianjin, February 27th (report from our newspaper) – In areas of Hebei Province that produce cotton and peanuts, a mass movement to pick up and sell cotton and peanuts has recently been launched.

Currently, more than 1.05 million people in 22 cotton-producing counties in Hebei Province are engaged in picking up and searching for cotton. In just ten days, they have recovered more than 7.26 million catties of cotton from the fields. In Cixian County, under the slogan of "The whole Party and all the people are mobilized to work hard and skillfully to find oil and cotton; thousands of troops and horses are mobilized together to complete the seven-day task in five days," more than 60,000 people were mobilized. In four days, they picked and harvested more than 1.12 million catties of cotton from the fields and cotton stalks, a four-fold increase compared to the actual picking volume in the previous five days. Recently, Luanzhou District in Tangshan City mobilized 97,000 people to dig and pick peanuts in the fields and pick peanuts from peanut vines. In just three days, they picked, collected, and sold more than 280,000 catties.

In order to ensure the successful completion of the 1958 agricultural product procurement task, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on February 6 to launch a crash campaign to complete the procurement of cotton and oil crops. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of commune production teams and members in picking, finding, and selling cotton and peanuts, the instructions emphasized that Party committees at all levels should strengthen ideological education work and stipulated necessary reward methods.

After receiving the instructions, Party committees at all levels immediately made specific arrangements. In the crash procurement campaign, all localities ensured that the secretaries took the lead and took action personally. Thirty county Party committee secretaries in fourteen key cotton-producing counties such as Ningjin and Gaocheng specifically led the crash cotton picking and procurement work, thereby further promoting the development of the movement.

In order to facilitate the masses in selling oil and cotton, staff members of grain and commercial departments in various places were mobilized to go all out. In addition to going deep into commune production teams for crash procurement, they also organized a group of voluntary procurement personnel in the communes and added a large number of procurement points and mobile teams to conduct procurement door-to-door. According to incomplete statistics from the three special districts of Handan, Shijiazhuang, and Tangshan, a total of 93 procurement stations and more than 2,800 procurement points and mobile procurement teams have been added, achieving "everyone in the village collects, everyone in the household goes door to door, procurement is multi-pointed, and sales do not leave the village."

    把生产成果全部收起来
    河北突击拣拾收购棉花油料
    本报天津27日电　河北省出产棉花和花生的地区，最近掀起了一个突击拣拾和交售棉花花生的群众性运动。
    目前河北省二十二个产棉县投入拾棉找棉的群众达一百零五万多人，他们在十天内仅从地里找回的棉花就有七百二十六万多斤。磁县在“全党全民总动员，苦干巧干找油、棉；千军万马齐出动，七天任务五天完”的口号下出动了六万多人，在四天里就从地里和棉秸上摘回棉花一百一十二万多斤，比前五天的实摘量上升四倍。唐山市滦州区最近发动九万七千多人分别到地里刨拾和从花生蔓上摘拣花生，仅三天时间，就拾拣并交售了二十八万多斤。
    中共河北省委为了保证胜利完成1958年农产品的采购任务，曾于2月6日发出突击完成棉花油料收购任务的指示。为了鼓励公社生产队和社员摘找和出售棉花、花生的积极性，指示中除强调各级党委要加强思想教育工作外，还规定了必要的奖励办法。
    各级党委在接到指示后，都立即进行了具体部署。在突击收购运动中，各地都做到书记挂帅，亲自动手。宁晋、藁城等十四个重点产棉县就有三十名县委书记具体领导突击棉花拾摘和收购工作，从而进一步推动了运动的开展。
    为了便利群众交售油料、棉花，各地粮食和商业部门的工作人员都动员起来，全力以赴。他们除深入公社生产队突击收购外，还在公社组织了一批义务收购员，增设了大批收购点和流动组，登门串户进行收购。据邯郸、石家庄、唐山等三个专区的不完全统计，共增设了九十三个收购站、二千八百多个收购点和流动收购组。做到了“村村有人收，户户有人串，收购多点化，交售不出村。”
