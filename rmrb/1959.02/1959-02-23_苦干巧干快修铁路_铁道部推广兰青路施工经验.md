Xinhua News Agency, Xining, February 22nd: The Ministry of Railways and the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently jointly held an on-site conference in Xining on the rapid construction of bridges, culverts, and roadbeds on the Lanqing Railway. More than 100 representatives from railway bureaus, engineering bureaus, design institutes, and railway corps across the country attended the meeting.

Since the construction of the Hekou-Xining section of the Lanqing Railway began in May of last year, the construction of bridges, tunnels, and other projects has been relatively concentrated, with a shortage of manpower and materials, and the construction season mostly falling during the rainy season. However, with the strong support of the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai, the railway workers demonstrated a spirit of solid work, hard work, and ingenuity, enabling the 170-plus kilometer line to basically reach the point where rails could be laid in just eight short months. The quality of the project met the design requirements.

The meeting held that: adhering to putting politics in command, launching a vigorous mass movement, struggling against nature on one hand and various right-leaning conservative ideas on the other, is the primary guarantee for rapid construction; vigorously carrying out technical revolution, improving tools, and striving to install finished products in construction as much as possible are the fundamental measures for rapid construction; fully preparing for construction and concentrating efforts to fight annihilation battles is the basic tactic for rapid construction; strengthening construction management, improving labor organization and work procedures, using local materials, and relying on one's own efforts are positive ways to promote rapid construction. In the construction process of the Lanqing Railway, in addition to relying closely on the masses and constantly clearing ideological obstacles through airing views, debates, and big-character posters, the Party organizations at all levels also insisted on implementing the policy of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," overcoming numerous difficulties in construction and consolidating the enthusiasm of the masses. Leaders at all levels also promoted the masses to continuously create new achievements through timely evaluations and on-site meetings. Now, all construction units of the Lanqing Railway have basically realized small-scale mechanized construction combining indigenous and foreign methods, and are continuing to reform small-scale machinery, create various machines and tools, and run their own factories, moving towards mechanization and semi-mechanization. According to incomplete statistics over the past year, the staff and workers of the entire bureau have put forward a total of one million rationalization proposals, of which more than 130,000 have been adopted. The tight construction schedule and the shortage of manpower, materials, and machinery are major difficulties in the construction of the Lanqing Railway. Under these circumstances, the Xining Railway Bureau adopted the method of "ensuring key points and taking care of the overall situation," concentrating manpower and material resources, and using the method of fighting annihilation battles to attack key projects, ensuring the smooth progress of the entire line project. In terms of labor organization, they adopted the method of mixed operation teams, which can carry out earthwork projects and build bridges; in terms of work procedures, they promoted parallel and cross-flow operations, which can expand the working surface and shorten the construction period.

At the meeting, Wu Jingtian, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, on behalf of the Ministry of Railways, presented silk banners to the eight counties and cities including Minhe, Ledu, and Xining, which actively organized forces to participate in the construction of the Lanqing Railway.

    苦干巧干快修铁路
    铁道部推广兰青路施工经验
    据新华社西宁22日电　铁道部、中共青海省委最近在西宁共同召开了兰青线桥涵、路基快速施工现场会议。参加会议的，有全国各铁路局、工程局、设计院以及铁道兵部队的一百多名代表。
    兰青铁路河口—西宁段自去年5月动工修筑以来，桥梁、隧道等工程的建设比较集中，人力和器材缺乏，施工季节又多在雨季。但是，铁路职工在青海各族人民大力支援下，发挥了实干、苦干、巧干的精神，使全段一百七十多公里的线路工程，只用了短短八个月的时间，就基本上达到可以铺轨的程度。工程质量达到设计要求。
    会议认为：坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，一面和自然斗争，一面和各种右倾保守思想斗争，是快速施工的首要保证；大闹技术革命，改良工具，在施工中尽量作到成品安装，是快速施工的根本措施；充分作好施工准备，集中精力打歼灭战，是快速施工的基本战术；加强施工管理，改善劳动组织和作业程序，就地取材，自力更生，又是促进快速施工的积极办法。兰青铁路在施工过程中，各级党组织除了紧紧依靠群众，通过鸣放辩论，不断扫清思想障碍以外，还坚持贯彻了“两参一改三结合”的方针，克服了施工中的重重困难，巩固了群众的干劲。各级领导还通过及时评比和召开现场会议，推动群众不断创造新的成绩。现在兰青铁路各施工单位都基本上实现了土洋并举的小型机械化施工，并正在继续改革小型机械、创制各种机具、自办工厂，向着机械化和半机械化方向迈进。据一年来的不完全统计，全局职工共提合理化建议一百万件，已采纳的有十三万多件。施工期限紧迫，而人力、材料、机具不足，是兰青路施工中较大的困难，在这种情况下，西宁铁路局采取“保证重点、照顾全盘”的办法，集中人力物力，用打歼灭战的办法突击重点工程，保证了全线工程顺利进行。在劳动组织上，他们采取混合作业队的办法，既可以作土方工程，又可以修桥梁；在作业程序上推行平行交叉流水作业，可以扩大工作面，缩短工期。
    会上，铁道部副部长武竞天代表铁道部向积极组织力量、参加兰青铁路修建工程的民和、乐都、西宁等八个县、市，赠送了锦旗。
