Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 24th: According to TASS, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Reilly, held a banquet at the British Embassy on the 23rd for British Prime Minister Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union.

    The Soviet side attending the banquet included Soviet leaders Khrushchev, Mikoyan, Kozlov, Kirichenko, Kosygin, Polyansky, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, and others.

    Macmillan and Khrushchev spoke at the banquet.

    In his speech, Macmillan first mentioned that, as this day was the 41st anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, he was reminded of the last World War. He said that we were infinitely impressed by the achievements of the Soviet Army and the indomitable spirit of the entire Russian people.

    Macmillan said: Since the end of that war, our relationship has rarely been like the one we had when we faced a common danger. Of course, in those days we had a common interest: a deadly danger threatened both our countries. So it is not surprising that we united against a common enemy.

    However, when considering the current world situation, I have a question: Do we still have a minimum common interest today? This common interest is peace. Regardless, despite all the difficulties and obstacles, let us unite for peace.

    In his speech, Khrushchev pointed out that he and the British Prime Minister had experienced two terrible and destructive wars. He emphasized that if we do not do everything possible to prevent a third world war, then it would be a great disaster not only for the people of our two countries, but also for all mankind.

    Khrushchev said to Macmillan: We believe that the talks between you and us are very beneficial, and we hope that the talks can achieve positive results. I think you are also looking for a way to reach an agreement with us. Of course, it is impossible to solve all the problems accumulated over the years at once. In talking with you, we appreciate your frankness. You understand not only the interests of your country and your side, but also the interests of our country and our side. This makes us happy, because dealing with problems in this way helps to find more reasonable solutions that satisfy both parties.

    Khrushchev then expressed regret that the friendly spirit of cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union, which was created in the battle against the common enemy, could not be maintained after the war. He said that the primary reason for this situation was the difference in social systems. But now, a long time has passed, and the situation has changed a lot, allowing us to recognize that differences in systems should not become an obstacle to establishing friendly relations between the two peoples and the two countries. The social conditions of a country depend on the will of the people of that country. We must recognize this fact, and we must start from the point that we live under different systems, but we live on the same planet. Therefore, we must find wise ways to overcome the current difficulties and do everything possible to defend world peace. This is the wish of the Soviet government and the wish of the Soviet people.

    Khrushchev then said that Mr. Macmillan is right: the people of Britain and the Soviet Union, the two countries, have a common interest in maintaining peace, and this common interest can become the basis for improving relations with each other.

    After the banquet, Macmillan and other British guests, accompanied by the Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Malik, went to visit Moscow University.

    In the auditorium of Moscow University, Macmillan spoke to hundreds of college students. He said that it would be foolish to deny that there are serious difficulties in the relations between countries. The task of national leaders is to eliminate these difficulties. He said that the British Foreign Secretary and he accepted the invitation to visit the Soviet Union precisely for this purpose.

    On the 24th, Macmillan and his entourage visited the Dubna Joint Institute for Nuclear Research near Moscow.

    赫鲁晓夫在英大使宴会上说
    希望英苏会谈获得积极成果
    麦克米伦说和平是两国共同利益
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：英国驻苏联大使赖利23日为英国首相麦克米伦访问苏联在英国大使馆举行宴会。
    苏联方面出席宴会的有：苏联领导人赫鲁晓夫、米高扬、科兹洛夫、基里钦科、柯西金、波利扬斯基，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯等。
    麦克米伦和赫鲁晓夫先后在宴会席上讲了话。
    麦克米伦在讲话中首先谈到，由于这一天是苏军建军四十一周年，他想起了上一次世界大战的情景。他说，我们曾对苏军取得的成就、对全体俄国人民的坚忍不拔的精神感到无限敬佩。
    麦克米伦说：自从那次大战结束以后，我们的关系很少像我们在面临共同危险时的那种关系。当然，在那些日子里我们有着共同的利益，致命的危险威胁着我们两国。所以我们联合起来反对共同的敌人是毫不奇怪的。
    然而，在思考当前世界局势的时候，我就产生了一个问题：我们今天是否还有一种起码的共同利益。这种共同利益就是和平。不管这样或那样，尽管存在各种困难和障碍，还是让我们为和平而联合起来吧。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中指出，他同英国首相曾经经历过两次可怕的破坏性战争。他强调说，如果我们不尽一切力量来防止第三次世界大战的话，那么这不仅是我们两国人民的极大的灾难，而且是全人类的极大的灾难。
    赫鲁晓夫对麦克米伦说：我们认为你我双方所进行的会谈很有益处，我们希望会谈能够得到积极的结果。我想，您也在寻找同我们达成协议的道路。当然，不可能一下子就解决掉多年来所积累下来的全部问题。在同您的谈话中我们喜欢您的开诚布公，您不仅了解贵国和你们方面的利益，而且也了解我国和我们这方面的利益。这使我们感到高兴，因为这样处理问题有助于找到较合理的、使双方都感到满意的解决。
    赫鲁晓夫接着对英苏两国没有能够在战后保持住在反对共同敌人的战斗中所产生的合作友好精神一点表示遗憾。他说，造成这种情况的首要原因在于社会制度的不同。但现在，已经过去了很长时间，情况也起了很多变化，使我们能够承认，制度的不同不应该在两国人民、两国建立友好关系方面成为障碍。某个国家的社会条件取决于这个国家人民的意志。我们必须承认这个事实，并且必须从这样一点出发，即我们生活在不同的制度下，但是却生活在一个星球上。因此，我们必须找到明智的办法来克服现在的困难和尽一切力量来保卫世界和平。这是苏联政府的愿望，是苏联人民的愿望。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，因此，麦克米伦先生说得很对：英苏两国人民、两国在维持和平方面具有共同的利害关系，这种利害关系可以成为改善彼此之间关系的基础。
    宴会结束后，麦克米伦和其他英国客人在苏联驻英国大使马立克的陪同下前往莫斯科大学参观。
    在莫斯科大学礼堂，麦克米伦向数百名大学生讲话。他说，如果否认各国之间关系中存在着严重的困难，是愚蠢的。国家领导人的任务就是消除这些困难。他说，英国外交大臣和他正是抱着这个目的接受了访问苏联的邀请。
    24日，麦克米伦和他的随行人员参观了莫斯科附近的杜布纳联合核子研究所。
