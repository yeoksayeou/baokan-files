    Fulfilling Foreign Aid Tasks on Time, with Quality and Quantity
    Beijing and Tianjin Promote the Spirit of National Coordination and Rush to Produce Important Orders
    (Our report) In the spirit of national coordination, Beijing's machinery and electrical manufacturing departments are taking a series of measures to resolutely ensure the completion of national plans, and strive to complete foreign aid and cooperation tasks on time, with quality and quantity.
    This year, Beijing's electromechanical industry has a large number of foreign aid and cooperation tasks. The scope of aid and cooperation includes many factories, mines, and enterprises across the country. The products include complete sets of equipment and accessories such as rolling mills, mining equipment, machine tools, high and low voltage switchgear, instruments, meters, automobiles, and tractor accessories.
    In order to resolutely and primarily complete these production tasks, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in its specific deployment, first conducted ideological education on national coordination among the employees of relevant departments and factories to overcome the ideas of individual units retreating in the face of difficulties or being insufficiently active in cooperation due to a simple pursuit of output value. At the same time, the following specific measures were taken: First, mobilize the masses to carry out technical revolution to ensure product quality, and at the same time, try every means to save the use of raw materials and find substitutes on the premise of ensuring quality in order to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials. Second, organize relevant factories in the city for large-scale cooperation based on product variety and quantity. Third, in order to overcome the difficulties of insufficient various components, in addition to organizing relevant factories to increase variety and output, the Beijing Municipal Planning Commission also organized two cooperation groups composed of负责人市机电局负责人和有关工厂参加,准备到上海、东北等地同有关单位签定合同 leaders of the Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering and relevant factories to prepare to sign contracts with relevant units in Shanghai, the Northeast, and other places. Fourth, conduct specific inspections of factories with aid or cooperation tasks on a regular basis. On the basis of investigating the idea of "national coordination," check the completion time of products, check the quality of products, and check whether the products are complete sets, paying special attention to checking the completion of products supported by key enterprises. If problems are found, help to solve them in a timely manner. Recently, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering have conducted several inspections successively.
    At present, relevant factories in Beijing are also actively taking measures to ensure the completion of foreign aid and cooperation tasks. The broad masses of employees said: The tasks must not only be completed quickly, but also well. The Beijing Automobile Factory, which is manufacturing accessories for the Changchun Automobile Manufacturing Factory and the Luoyang Tractor Factory, recently convened a representative meeting of all employees. After the factory leaders reported the tasks and significance of cooperation to all employee representatives, the representatives immediately put forward the slogan "It is glorious to manufacture cars, and it is also glorious to manufacture car accessories." According to the unified arrangement of the state, this manufacturing factory will focus on manufacturing accessories for automobiles and tractors this year, reducing the original plan to manufacture sedans.

    (Our report from Tianjin on the 23rd) Tianjin, one of the national industrial bases, is resolutely implementing the policy of "national coordination." According to the unified arrangement of the state, it is actively increasing the production of means of production needed to achieve the four major national indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton.
    "Rushing to manufacture coking equipment for 18 million tons of steel" is the battle slogan of the employees in Tianjin's electromechanical industry. After receiving the task of 270 sets of Hongqi No. 2 simple coking furnaces and 150 sets of simple coking supporting equipment, the employees immediately joined the battle and set off a new upsurge of production. The Deqing Machine Factory, whose employees have won praise from coal miners for producing various rotating chains for the coal industry, actively tapped the potential of existing equipment. Following the over-fulfillment of the plan in January, they made further progress in February. By the 17th, they had overfulfilled the full-month output value plan, which was four times higher than the same period last year, by 1%. All indicators such as output, variety, and quality were also successfully completed. A large number of chains are being transported to the mines to support coal production.
    In the city's 48 factories rushing to manufacture irrigation and drainage equipment, employees have launched a vigorous production competition, and new technologies and new records have emerged. Employees of the Flour Machinery Factory actively improved operations, shortening the time required to process a crankshaft for a gas engine from eleven and a half hours to seven hours, and supplying the products to the cooperating factory in advance. As of mid-February, these factories rushing to manufacture irrigation and drainage equipment have produced 1,027 gas engines, gasoline engines, etc., of which more than 400 have been transported to the countryside to support farmers in striving for a bumper harvest of grain and cotton. Tianjin's chemical industry employees are also trying every means to increase the production of pesticides. In the first quarter of this year, they will produce more than 13,500 tons of various pesticides, an increase of five to ten times compared with the fourth quarter of last year. As of February 20, 7,300 tons of only four pesticides, including "666" and 1605, have been produced.
    In order to ensure the implementation of the "national coordination" policy, many factories in Tianjin have obeyed the unified arrangements of the state and re-arranged the production of their factories according to priorities. Relevant factories in the electromechanical industry stopped some non-urgent production tasks to make way for concentrating all efforts on producing irrigation and drainage machinery needed for current wheat field irrigation and spring plowing. In the allocation and use of raw materials, measures have also been taken to prioritize the production needs of products uniformly allocated by the state, and reduce the supply of raw materials for some unplanned products, so that raw materials can be used rationally.

    按期按质按量完成支援外地任务
    北京天津发扬全国一盘棋精神赶制重要订货
    本报讯　根据全国一盘棋的精神，北京市机械、电器制造部门正采取一系列措施，在坚决保证完成国家计划的同时，力争按期、按质、按量地完成对外地的支援和协作任务。
    北京机电工业今年对外地的支援和协作任务很大。支援和协作的范围包括全国许多工厂、矿山、企业，产品有轧钢机、矿山设备、机床、高低压开关柜、仪器、仪表、汽车和拖拉机附件等成套设备和配件。
    为了坚决和首先完成这些生产任务，中共北京市委在具体部署中，首先在各有关部门及有关工厂的职工中，进行了关于全国一盘棋的思想教育，克服个别单位知难而退或因单纯追求产值而对协作不够积极的思想。同时采取如下具体措施：一、发动群众大搞技术革命，保证产品质量，同时千方百计地节约对原材料的使用，在保证质量的前提下，寻找代用品，以克服某些原材料不足的困难。二、根据产品品种和数量情况，组织全市有关工厂进行大协作。三、为了克服各种元件不足的困难，除组织有关工厂增加品种、产量外，北京市计划委员会还组织了由市机电局负责人和有关工厂参加的两个协作团，准备到上海、东北等地同有关单位签定合同。四、对有关有支援或协作任务的工厂，经常进行具体检查。在查“全国一盘棋”思想的基础上，查产品完成的时间，查产品质量，查产品是否成套，特别注意查对重点企业支援的产品完成的情况。发现问题及时帮助解决。最近中共北京市委和北京市机电局已先后进行了几次检查。
    现在，北京市各有关工厂也正在积极采取措施，保证对外地支援和协作任务的完成，广大职工表示：任务不但要完成得快，而且要完成得好。为长春汽车制造厂和洛阳拖拉机厂制造附件任务的北京汽车制造厂，最近召开了全厂职工代表大会，当工厂的领导上把协作的任务和意义向全体职工代表做了报告后，代表们立即在会上提出了“制造汽车光荣，制造汽车附件也光荣”的口号，这个制造厂根据国家的统一安排，今年将以制造汽车、拖拉机的附件为主要任务，削减了原来制造小轿车的计划。（雷润明）
    本报天津23日电　全国工业基地之一的天津市，广大职工坚决贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针，根据国家的统一安排，积极增产为实现全国钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标所需的生产资料。
    “为了一千八百万吨钢赶制炼焦设备”，是天津市机电行业职工的战斗口号。当他们接到二百七十套红旗二号简易炼焦炉和一百五十套简易炼焦配套设备的任务以后，职工们立即投入战斗，掀起了新的生产高潮。为煤炭工业部门生产各种转动链条获得煤矿工人好评的德庆机器厂，职工们积极挖掘现有设备潜力，继1月份超额完成计划以后，2月份乘胜猛进，到17日又超额1％完成了比去年同期增长四倍的全月产值计划，产量、品种、质量等各项指标也都胜利完成。大量的链条正源源运往矿山，支援煤炭生产。
    在全市四十八个赶制排灌设备的工厂里，职工们开展了轰轰烈烈的生产竞赛，新技术、新纪录不断涌现。面粉机械厂职工积极改进操作，把加工一个煤气机曲轴所需的时间由十一个半小时缩短到七个小时，提前把产品供应给协作厂。截至2月中旬，这些赶制排灌设备的工厂已经生产出煤气机、汽油机等一千零二十七台，其中有四百多台已经运往农村，支援农民争取粮、棉大丰收。天津化学工业职工也在千方百计地增产农药，今年第一季度将生产各种农药一万三千五百多吨，比去年第四季度增加五倍到十倍。截至2月20日，仅“六六六”、一六○五等四种农药，就已经生产出七千三百多吨。
    为了保证“全国一盘棋”方针的贯彻，天津市许多工厂服从国家的统一安排，根据轻重缓急分别地重新安排了本厂的生产。机电行业有关工厂将一些不急迫的生产任务停车让路，以便集中全力生产当前麦田浇灌和春耕所需的排灌机械。在原材料的分配和使用上，也采取了优先满足国家统一分配产品的生产需要的措施，减少一些非计划产品的原材料的供应数量，使原材料得到合理使用。（附图片）
