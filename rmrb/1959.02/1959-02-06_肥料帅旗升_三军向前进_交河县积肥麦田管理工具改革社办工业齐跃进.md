Tianjin Daily News: The Jiahe County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province, during the spring plowing preparation period, implemented the "fertilizer first" policy, driving other agricultural activities, and a vigorous atmosphere of comprehensive leap forward appeared. As of January 31, the county had accumulated a total of 20.6 billion jin of various fertilizers, with more than 7,000 jin of fertilizer available per mu of cultivated land; daily fertilizer accumulation increased from 400 million jin before January 14 to 950 million jin. At the same time, multiple economic undertakings, wheat field management, tool reform, commune-run industry, and winter sanitation campaigns, driven by fertilizer accumulation, also made a comprehensive leap forward. Seventy-two thousand mu of the county's 850,000 mu of wheat fields have been covered with fertilizer, and more than 200,000 mu of barren land have been fertilized; more than 50 kinds of multiple economic production have been initiated, with a total net profit of 7.8 million yuan, nearly double the increase compared to December last year; more than 98,000 tool reforms have been carried out, an increase of 60% over the previous month; even greater achievements have been made in livestock care and protection, with the number of fattened livestock in the county increasing to more than 30,000 head, and significant progress has also been made in the winter sanitation campaigns in various communes.

How can fertilizer be made the leader and drive the comprehensive development of various tasks? The Jiahe County Committee first organized cadres at all levels in the county to conduct a debate on whether fertilizer should be the leader, whether there is a connection between fertilizer accumulation and other tasks, and whether grasping fertilizer can drive the comprehensive leap forward of other tasks. By summarizing the facts of fertilizer leading the comprehensive leap forward, the primary and secondary relationships and dialectical relationships between fertilizer accumulation and other tasks were specifically explained to the cadres. After learning and debating, cadres at all levels not only improved their understanding but also gained working methods, and they all mustered greater revolutionary enthusiasm to lead the masses in a comprehensive leap forward. For example, when the Fuzhen Commune organized cadres to study, it summarized the experience of Fengzhuang Brigade in accumulating large amounts of fertilizer by boiling niter, explaining that fertilizer accumulation can drive sideline production. This brigade used one stove for boiling niter and another for smoking fertilizer, and in ten days, the entire team boiled 3,500 jin of niter and smoked 450,000 jin of fertilizer. The commune members said that this was a good thing, as it both accumulated fertilizer and boiled niter, killing two birds with one stone. Once everyone got started, the team built 18 niter factories in five days, producing more than 20,000 jin of niter and smoking 8.75 million jin of fertilizer.

After a general debate and cadres at all levels recognized the significance of fertilizer being the leader, leaders at all levels, from the county to the production team, also comprehensively arranged various tasks, sorted them into categories, and defined the specific content of each task. Whichever task was related to fertilizer accumulation was prioritized; tasks with little or no relation were carried out on the premise of not affecting fertilizer accumulation. In this way, once fertilizer accumulation was grasped, everything moved, both focusing on the key points and taking care of the overall situation, and a new situation of comprehensive work leap forward quickly emerged. In the work of diversified economy, we first focused on pig raising for fertilizer accumulation, niter boiling and running various workshops and other sideline occupations related to fertilizer accumulation. Through boiling niter, the county produced 78 million jin of local chemical fertilizer, and at the same time produced more than 3.1 million jin of niter. The number of pigs raised in the county has increased to more than 110,000, so that every pig has a pen, and in just over a month, 500 million jin of fertilizer have been accumulated. Nanpi Commune, by focusing on fertilizer accumulation, started 21 various workshops, making a profit of 25,000 yuan in half a month, and also accumulated 180 million jin of fertilizer. In agricultural production, the county also focused on livestock care and protection and wheat field fertilization work related to fertilizer accumulation.

In the winter sanitation work, combined with fertilizer accumulation to do environmental sanitation, the county has universally carried out the "Seven Cleans" (clean houses, clean streets, clean toilets, clean feeding sheds, clean grinding roads, clean threshing grounds, clean chicken coops) campaign, and also accumulated more than 3 billion jin of fertilizer. In the tool reform, we first focused on the reform of fertilizer accumulation, transportation and fertilization tools. Among the more than 98,000 pieces of agricultural tools reformed in the county, there were more than 52,000 transportation tools such as carts and small carts, which not only overcame the difficulty of lacking transportation tools, accelerated the speed of fertilizer transportation, but also greatly promoted the tool reform movement. The amount of fertilizer delivered daily in the county has increased more than threefold compared to before. In addition, the fertilizer accumulation movement also drove water conservancy construction. For example, Fuzhen Commune has 42 large pits, and by combining digging fertilizer, the large pits were dug into reservoirs, accumulating 210 million jin of fertilizer. These reservoirs can now store water for irrigation.

When arranging various tasks, in order to truly make fertilizer accumulation the leader, from the county to the production team, the organizational leadership of fertilizer accumulation and transportation work was universally strengthened, the fertilizer accumulation front was divided at all levels, and a fertilizer accumulation command and leading group was established, headed by the first secretary of the Party Committee at all levels, with two or three other secretaries specifically in charge. A total of more than 3,400 cadres above the small team level were transferred from the county to manage fertilizer accumulation. The county also appropriately transferred labor from various economic undertakings, wheat field management, industry and other fronts into the fertilizer accumulation movement, and together with the original labor force on the fertilizer accumulation front, formed a professional fertilizer accumulation army. In this way, each task had soldiers and generals, and the work focus was also very prominent.

In addition to organizing professional teams to carry out large-scale fertilizer accumulation, Jiahe County also assigned fertilizer accumulation tasks to organs, schools, factories, and other non-professional fertilizer accumulation personnel through the method of "four fixings" (fixed time, fixed quality, fixed quantity, fixed rewards) combined with work, so that everyone accumulated fertilizer, both completing the fertilizer accumulation task and doing a good job in various agricultural activities.

    肥料帅旗升　三军向前进
    交河县积肥麦田管理工具改革社办工业齐跃进
    天津日报消息　中共河北交河县委在春耕准备期间，实行肥料挂帅，带动起其他各项农事活动，出现了全面跃进的蓬勃气象。到1月31日止，全县共积造各种肥料二百零六亿斤，每亩耕地可上肥七千余斤；每日积肥由1月14日以前的四亿斤，增加到九亿五千斤。与此同时，多种经济、麦田管理、工具改革、社办工业以及冬季卫生运动等各项工作，在积肥的带动下，也全面向前跃进。全县八十五万亩麦田已经盖肥七十二万亩，白田送肥二十万余亩；多种经济生产已搞起五十多种，共获纯利七百八十万元，较去年12月份增加近一倍；工具改革九万八千多件，较上月增加60％；爱畜保畜成绩更大，全县肥壮牲畜已增加到三万多头，各社冬季卫生运动也取得显著成绩。
    怎样使肥料挂上帅，又带动各项工作全面开展起来呢？交河县委首先组织全县各级干部，对要不要肥料挂帅，积肥造肥与其他工作有没有联系，通过抓肥料能不能带动起其他工作全面跃进等等问题，进行了鸣放辩论，并且通过总结肥料挂帅带动全面工作跃进的事实，具体地向干部讲明了积肥和其他工作的主次关系和辩证关系。各级干部经过学习和辩论，不仅认识提高，而且有了工作办法，都鼓起了更大的革命干劲，领导群众全面跃进。如富镇公社在组织干部学习的时候，总结了冯庄大队通过熬硝大量积肥的经验，来说明积肥可以带动副业。这个大队用一头生火熬硝一头熏肥的办法，十天全队熬硝三千五百斤，同时熏肥四十五万斤。社员们说，这是个好事，又积了肥，又熬了硝，一举两得。大家一动手，五天全队就建起硝厂十八个，出硝两万余斤，熏肥八百七十五万斤。
    在普遍进行辩论，各级干部认清了肥料挂帅的意义以后，从县到生产队各级领导还全面安排了各项工作，分类排队，划定各项工作的具体内容。哪项工作与积肥有关系，就先抓哪一项；关系不大的或者是没有关系的，就在不影响积肥的前提下进行。这样，积肥一抓，各处都动，既抓住了重点，又照顾了全面，迅速出现了全面工作跃进的新局面。在多种经济工作上，先抓住了与积肥有关的养猪积肥、熬硝和开办各种作坊等副业。通过熬硝，全县制土化肥七千八百万斤，同时产硝三百一十多万斤。全县养猪已增加到十一万多只，作到了猪猪有圈，仅一个多月的时间，积肥就有五亿斤。南皮公社通过狠抓积肥，搞起各种作坊二十一处，半个月获利二万五千元，还积肥一亿八千万斤。这个县在农业生产上，还抓住了与积肥有关的爱畜保畜和麦田盖肥工作。
    在冬季卫生工作上，结合积肥搞环境卫生，全县普遍开展了七净
  （屋净、街道净、厕所净、饲养棚净、碾磨道净、场净、鸡窝棚净）运动，还积肥三十多亿斤。在工具改革上，首先抓住了积肥、运肥、施肥工具的改革。全县在改革的九万八千多件农具中，大车、小车等运输工具就有五万二千余件，不仅克服了缺乏运输工具的困难，加快了运肥速度，而且大大推动了工具改革运动。全县每日送肥的数量较前增加三倍多。此外，积肥运动还带动了水利建设。如富镇公社有四十二个大坑，结合挖肥，把大坑挖成了水柜，积肥两亿一千万斤。这些水柜现在就能蓄水浇地。
    在安排各项工作的时候，为使积肥真正挂帅，从县到生产队普遍加强了积肥运肥工作的组织领导，逐级划分了积肥战线，建立了积肥造肥指挥部和领导小组，由各级党委第一书记挂帅，另有二至三名书记具体领导。全县共抽调了小队以上的干部三千四百余人专管积肥。全县还适当抽调了多种经济、麦田管理、工业等战线上的劳动力投入积肥运动，加上原来积肥战线上的劳动力，组成了一支专业积肥大军。这样就使各项工作有兵有将，工作重点也很突出。
    交河县除去组织专业队大搞积肥以外，还对机关、学校、工厂以及其他非专业搞积肥的人员，通过四定（定时、定质、定量、定奖励）和结合工作的办法，分配了积肥的任务，作到了人人积肥，既完成了积肥任务，又搞好了各项农事活动。
