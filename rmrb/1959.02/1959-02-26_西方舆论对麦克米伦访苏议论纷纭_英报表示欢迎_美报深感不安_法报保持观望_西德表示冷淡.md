Western Public Opinion Divided on Macmillan's Visit to the Soviet Union
British Press Welcomes It, American Press Feels Deeply Uneasy
French Press Remains Observant, West Germany Expresses Coldness

(Our Dispatch) London—Macmillan's current visit to the Soviet Union has drawn widespread attention from Western newspapers and public opinion.

Most of the British public opinion welcomes Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union. According to a Reuters report, Conservative Party members generally expressed satisfaction with Macmillan's proactive steps. Labour Party members also very much hope that Macmillan will reconcile with the Soviet Union, while they believe this is an action to put the Conservative Party in a very favorable position in the next general election. Many British newspapers have predicted the prospects of Macmillan's visit. The extreme imperialist newspaper "Daily Express" said: This visit "should make it possible to reach an agreement on the expansion of British-Russian trade." It added: "There are different opinions between the two countries on the future of Germany. However, implementing military disengagement in Europe and withdrawing troops from Germany would be a sensible policy for Britain." At the same time, many British newspapers pointed out in their commentaries that, due to Dulles' illness, Macmillan is now "in a unique position" ("Sunday Times").

American newspapers emphasized that Macmillan's trip is for "probing" rather than negotiation. The "New York Times," in referring to Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union, said that Prime Minister Macmillan went to Moscow to find out the true intentions and nature of Soviet policy, which would provide better guidance for formulating Western policy than further studying the wording of Soviet notes. Many American newspapers also mentioned that, during Dulles' leave of absence, Macmillan will become the "chief spokesperson" for Western countries. The "New York Times" said uneasily that people have "a very skeptical attitude" towards the British Prime Minister's visit. The "New York Post" also wrote: "We oppose the widespread view that Macmillan's visit is appropriate... Macmillan's visit does increase the world's suspicion, they do not know whether the United States is still in a leading position." Regarding the prospects of this visit, the "New York Times" said that, apart from some nominal results that seem to be achieved in cultural and trade relations, no results are likely to be achieved on other issues such as the Berlin issue, the German issue, and disarmament. The "Washington Post" even demanded that Macmillan "must not compromise on the primary Berlin issue."

The French "Echo" said in an article that Macmillan can not only understand the views of the Soviet leaders, but also "do more things," that is, "he can promote negotiations between the two camps." However, the Paris "French Observer" weekly believes: "Macmillan's trip to Moscow, apart from trying to lay the foundation for the conclusion of a British-Russian trade agreement and trying once again to explore the Soviet Union's true intentions on the German issue, will be difficult to do anything else. As for 'extending a hand' to Khrushchev, even if Macmillan really has this hope, it will actually be impossible for the British Prime Minister, because he made a promise to Dulles, Paris has a cold attitude, and Bonn is reserved, so he is constrained." This weekly added: "Macmillan has no intention of sacrificing the Anglo-American alliance in exchange for a new diplomatic system... he cannot act arbitrarily."

The West German ruling clique showed particular coldness towards Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union. The West German Social Democratic Party's press release said: Macmillan's trip is not at all pleasing to Adenauer. Adenauer believes that this trip has the danger of weakening the "unified Western front." The pro-government "General Anzeiger" also said that it seems that Britain is disregarding Adenauer's firm policy towards the Soviet Union. Although the influential West German "Die Welt" said that Macmillan's exploration in Moscow will help clarify the Soviet Union's attitude on the issue of East-West relations, it also said: Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union will not bring about miraculous changes in East-West relations. Macmillan will not conduct other negotiations apart from negotiating in the narrow and relatively unimportant aspects of trade and cultural relations between the Soviet Union and Britain, because he knows that he must never harm the West's negotiating position by hastily proposed suggestions. The German Press Agency also pointed out in its report that Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union was to "win a superior position" for Britain in the negotiations on the German issue.

    西方舆论对麦克米伦访苏议论纷纭
    英报表示欢迎　美报深感不安
    法报保持观望　西德表示冷淡
    本报讯　目前英国首相麦克米伦在苏联进行的访问，引起了西方报纸舆论的普遍重视。
    英国的大部分舆论都对麦克米伦访问苏联表示欢迎。据路透社消息，保守党议员对麦克米伦所采取的主动步骤普遍表示满意。工党议员也非常希望麦克米伦同苏联和解，同时他们认为这是为了使保守党在下次大选中处于一个非常有利的地位的行动。不少英国报纸对麦克米伦这次访问的前景作了预测。极端帝国派报纸“每日快报”说：这次访问“应该有可能就扩大英俄贸易问题达成协议”。它又说：“关于德国前途问题，两国之间是有不同的意见的。但是，在欧洲实行军事脱离接触和从德国撤退军队，对英国来说，却会是一项通情达理的政策”。同时许多英国报纸在评论中指出：由于杜勒斯正在患病，现在已使麦克米伦“处于一个独一无二的地位”。（“星期日泰晤士报”）。
    美国报纸强调指出，麦克米伦此行目的是进行“试探”而不是谈判。“纽约时报”在谈到麦克米伦访苏时说，麦克米伦首相前往莫斯科是为了找出苏联政策的真正意图和性质，这对于制订西方政策比进一步研究苏联照会的措词会提供更好的指针。不少美国报纸也提到，在杜勒斯请假期间，麦克米伦将成为西方国家的“首席发言人”。“纽约时报”不安地说，人们对英国首相的这次访问“抱着一种十分怀疑的态度”。“纽约邮报”也写道：“我们反对这样一种普遍的看法：认为麦克米伦进行这次访问是合适的……麦克米伦的访问的确加重了全世界的怀疑，他们不知道美国是否还处于领导地位”。对于这次访问的前景，“纽约时报”说，除了在文化和贸易关系问题上看来会取得某些有名无实的结果外，其他关于柏林问题、德国问题和裁军等问题都不见得会取得任何结果。“华盛顿邮报”甚至要求麦克米伦“不能在首要的柏林问题上妥协。”
    法国“回声报”在一篇文章中说，麦克米伦不仅可以了解苏联领导人的看法，而且还可以“做更多的事情”，也就是说“他可以促进两个阵营之间举行谈判”。但是巴黎“法兰西观察家”周刊却认为：“麦克米伦前往莫斯科，除了试图为缔结一项英俄贸易协定奠定基础并设法再一次试探苏联在德国问题上的真正意图之外，将难于作到别的事情。至于向赫鲁晓夫‘伸出手来’，即使麦克米伦真正有此希望，对这位英国首相来说，实际上将是不可能的，因为他向杜勒斯许下了诺言，巴黎方面态度冷淡，波恩则有所保留，所以他受到约束”。这家周刊又说：“麦克米伦根本无意牺牲英美联盟而代之以一种新的外交体系……他不能独断独行”。
    西德统治集团对麦克米伦的访苏表现特别冷淡。西德社会民主党新闻公报说：麦克米伦这次旅行对阿登纳来说一点也不值得高兴。阿登纳认为这次旅行有着使“西方统一阵线”削弱的危险。亲政府的“总汇报”也说，看来英国是无视阿登纳对苏联的坚定政策。而西德影响很大的“世界报”虽然表示麦克米伦到莫斯科的探测，有助于弄明白苏联对东西方关系问题上的态度。但是它又说：麦克米伦这次访苏不会使东西方关系发生神奇的变化。麦克米伦除了会在苏英两国的贸易和文化关系这一狭隘而比较不重要的方面进行谈判之外，不会进行其他谈判，因为他知道，他绝不能通过匆匆提出的建议来危害西方的谈判地位。德意志新闻社在报道中还特别指出，麦克米伦这次访苏是要为英国在德国问题的谈判中“赢得一个优越的地位”。
