Xinhua News Agency, February 27th – The People's Liberation Army's patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests, emphasize hygiene, and eradicate diseases has achieved great success. According to incomplete statistics, in ten months last year, the entire army eliminated more than 18 million rats, more than 14 million sparrows, more than 2.2 million catties of mosquitoes and flies (including larvae, maggots, and pupae), dredged more than 9,000 kilometers of ditches, filled more than 9.8 million cubic meters of depressions, and removed more than 9.6 million tons of garbage. Many units have achieved cleanliness and hygiene in indoor areas, personal habits, water sources, and food handling. Many units have also made significant contributions to helping the local people eliminate the four pests, treat diseases, train medical personnel, and develop health services. Sixteen units have received awards from the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, and 240 units have been recognized as advanced units by local patriotic health campaign committees.

    Party committees taking the lead, combined with specialized personnel and the broad masses, is an important guarantee for the achievements of the People's Liberation Army's health work. Under the slogan of "Mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses to carry out health campaigns," all units have fully utilized the enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses, solved many difficult problems that could not be solved in past health campaigns, and created many sanitary appliances. For example, the "666 gypsum bricks" created by a certain unit stationed in Nanjing by mobilizing the masses solved the problem of eliminating larvae in rice paddies. Xiang Xianhai, a member of the Communist Youth League of the Shanghai Garrison, dissected more than 50 rats, analyzed the nature of the food in the rats' stomachs, and found experience in catching rats. He caught 2,897 rats in nine months. Troops stationed in Guangzhou, Beijing, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Chengdu and other places, under the slogan of "Spending no money, spending less money, and vigorously carrying out health campaigns," used waste products and substitutes to make many sanitary facilities such as spittoons, tap water devices, and disinfection boxes for bowls and chopsticks. Some created sweeping machines, some invented wind-powered fly catchers, and some also made or modified sparrow-shooting guns, which improved the efficiency of eliminating the four pests. Troops stationed in Nanjing, Lanzhou and other places also went to the wild and even deep mountains and forests to collect wild plants to make their own insecticides. Troops on the Fujian front also used wild plants to make medicines for treating acute bacillary dysentery.

    In the health campaign, the health departments of various units also paid great attention to going deep into the troops, discovering problems, providing timely technical guidance and promoting advanced experience, so that the campaign continued to move forward. When a certain unit stationed in Nanjing organized the digging of fly pupae, more than 1,000 people were dispatched on the first day, but only more than two catties of fly pupae were dug. After on-site guidance by health personnel, more than 1,100 catties of fly pupae were dug in one morning.

    In terms of preventing and eliminating diseases, all units promoted the advanced experience of combining troops with hospitals and troops with health and epidemic prevention and inspection stations, forming a strong prevention and control system throughout the army. Medical officers and epidemic prevention personnel also frequently went deep into companies, military training sites, construction sites, and forward positions to conduct medical treatment and health and epidemic prevention work.

    除四害  讲卫生  消灭疾病
    解放军各部获得巨大成绩
    新华社27日讯　中国人民解放军除四害、讲卫生和消灭疾病的爱国卫生运动获得巨大成绩。据不完全统计，全军去年十个月内消灭老鼠一千八百多万只，麻雀一千四百多万只，蚊、蝇（包括孑孓、蛆、蛹）二百二十多万斤，疏通沟渠九千多公里，填平洼地九百八十多万立方公尺，清除垃圾九百六十多万吨。许多部队都做到了室内、个人、水源、食物处处清洁卫生。不少单位还在帮助驻地人民群众除四害、医疗疾病、培养医务人员和兴办卫生事业中作出了显著成绩。有十六个单位受到中央爱国卫生运动委员会的奖状奖励，二百四十个单位被当地爱国卫生运动委员会评为先进单位。
    党委挂帅，专门人才和广大群众相结合是人民解放军卫生工作取得成就的重要保证。在“发动群众、依靠群众开展卫生运动”的口号下，各部队充分发挥了群众的干劲和智慧，解决了许多过去在卫生运动中没法解决的困难问题，并创造了许多卫生器械。如驻南京部队某部发动群众创造的“六六六石膏砖”，解决了消灭稻田里孑孓的问题。上海警备部队共青团员项先海，解剖了五十多只老鼠，分析老鼠胃里食物的性质，找到了捕鼠的经验，一个人在九个月中捕鼠二千八百九十七只。驻广州、北京、内蒙古、新疆、成都等地的部队，在“不花钱、少花钱，大搞卫生运动”的口号下，用废品和代用品制作了许多痰孟、自来水装置和碗筷消毒箱等卫生设备。有的创造了扫地机，有的发明了风力抓蝇器，有的还自制或改制了打雀枪，提高了除四害的效率。驻南京、兰州等地的部队，还到野外甚至深山密林中采集野生植物自制杀虫药剂。福建前线部队也用野生植物制成了治疗急性菌痢的药剂。
    在卫生运动中，各单位卫生部门还十分注意深入部队，发现问题，及时进行技术指导和推广先进经验，使运动不断向前发展。驻南京部队某部组织挖蝇蛹时，第一天出动了一千多人，只挖了两斤多蝇蛹。经卫生人员现场指导后，一个上午就挖了蝇蛹一千一百多斤。
    在防治和消灭疾病方面，各单位推行了部队与医院，部队与卫生防疫检验所相结合的先进经验，在全军形成强有力的防治体系。医务干部和防疫人员还经常深入连队、军训场所、施工场地、前沿阵地进行诊疗，开展卫生防疫工作。
