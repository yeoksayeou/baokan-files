Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, February 24th: The wheat symposium held in Zhengzhou City from February 19th to 21st, attended by responsible cadres in charge of wheat production from ten provinces and cities, including Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Beijing, discussed how to strive for an even greater wheat harvest this year. The responsible cadres in charge of wheat production from the ten provinces and cities expressed their determination to strive to achieve "one season equals one year," determined to fight the first battle of this year's agricultural production and ensure the over-fulfillment of the annual agricultural production increase tasks.

The symposium was presided over by Comrade Tan Zhenlin, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Secretariat. Comrade Liao Luyan, Deputy Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Minister of Agriculture, and Comrade Liu Ruilong, Deputy Minister of Agriculture, also attended the meeting.

These ten provinces and cities are the main winter wheat producing areas in the country, accounting for more than 80% of the country's winter wheat area, of which large-scale high-yield demonstration plots account for more than 30% of the wheat planting area. This year, the wheat is growing well in these areas, with seedlings in most areas now turning green, from the Shandong Peninsula to the Guanzhong Plain; from the Yellow River Basin to both sides of the Yangtze River, wheat seedlings are growing vigorously on thousands of miles of fertile land, a scene of lush greenery. In the earlier-season Sichuan Basin, wheat has already begun to develop ears.

According to reports at the meeting, wheat in these ten provinces and cities was sown earlier and better this year, and field management also started early and was of high quality. Before sowing, the general wheat fields were deep-plowed to about one foot, and some reached one and a half to two feet or more, one to two times deeper than in previous years. Deep plowing area accounts for more than 80% of the total wheat field area. The amount of base fertilizer applied was generally three to four times more than last year, with ordinary wheat fields applying 10,000 to 20,000 jin per mu, and high-yield fields applying 30,000 to 50,000 jin or more per mu. Dense planting was generally implemented everywhere, reducing row spacing, and the amount of seeds sown was generally 25 to 30 jin, more than double that of previous years, with high-yield fields sowing 40 to 80 jin or more. The area of improved varieties accounts for more than 80% of the winter sowing area. The vast majority of seeds were soaked and treated. In order to prevent underground insects as early as possible, some provinces also carried out soil treatment before sowing. After wheat sowing, all localities carried out wheat field management movements with a spirit of interlocking links and grasping to the end. According to incomplete statistics from Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces, a total of more than 20 million laborers were invested in wheat field management, and 500,000 professional wheat field management teams were organized. At present, the area of topdressing in wheat fields has reached more than 90%, generally applying about 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, three to four times more than the same period last year, with high-yield fields applying 30,000 to 50,000 jin or more per mu. The area of winter irrigation has doubled compared to last year, and all localities are now preparing for spring irrigation. Due to the serious strengthening of management, wheat has successfully passed the full emergence and overwintering stages. According to the wheat seedling ranking situation in various provinces and cities, the current characteristics of wheat growth are: many seedlings, deep roots, and thick stems. First-class wheat fields account for an average of 57%, with more than 500,000 to 800,000 plants per mu, and the number of tillering plants in high-yield demonstration plots reaching more than 1 million. Second-class wheat fields account for 34.2%, with about 300,000 to 500,000 plants per mu. Third-class wheat fields account for 8.8%, with about 200,000 to 300,000 plants per mu. Therefore, the characteristics of wheat growth this year are that the foundation is sufficient and the management is grasped early. These have laid a strong material foundation for ensuring an even greater wheat harvest this year.

After analyzing the above favorable conditions, the meeting pointed out that although there are these favorable conditions, in order to strive to achieve the grand goal of "one season equals one year" (equals the entire year of 1957), it is necessary to further overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, fully recognize the favorable conditions for wheat growth this year, muster greater revolutionary vigor, formulate advanced indicators and measures, and do everything possible to achieve what can be achieved through all efforts. At the same time, it is also necessary to fight against the complacency and paralysis of thinking that is satisfied with the good growth of wheat and relaxes efforts. After overcoming conservative thinking and a mass production upsurge, complacency and paralysis of thinking are the main dangers in striving for an even greater wheat harvest this year. Therefore, all localities must constantly fight against the above two erroneous thoughts. Now, many places have attached importance to this issue, and through methods such as checking the number of plants, checking the growth situation, checking the measures, and calculating the yield, have launched debates, powerfully refuted skeptics and pessimists, and overcome complacency and paralysis, further mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses.

Wheat yield is composed of several factors, such as the number of plants, the number of ears, the number of grains, and the grain weight. Therefore, the meeting believes that in accordance with the wheat growth law, it is necessary to seize the key stages of turning green, jointing and heading, flowering and grain filling, and harvesting to achieve "five increases" (increase plants, increase ears, increase grains, increase grain weight, increase yield). This year, the overwintering stage of wheat in various places has generally been good, and the current main task is to successfully navigate the wheat turning green stage. The high-yield experiences in various places have proven that the turning green stage not only determines the number of wheat ears, but is also related to the size of the ears; jointing and heading are important stages to ensure the healthy development of stems and improve the seed setting rate; flowering and grain filling play a decisive role in ensuring large and full grains. Therefore, the meeting believes that throughout the entire growth process of wheat, it is necessary to take effective measures, link one ring to another, grasp to the end, conscientiously ensure sufficient water and fertilizer, meticulous management, and implement the spirit of "management does not stop until wheat is harvested." Clearly recognize that as wheat grows, the task of wheat field management becomes heavier and heavier, and the work must be done more and more carefully.

The meeting also focused on studying how to prepare early and do a good job in "five preventions" (prevent drought and waterlogging, prevent diseases and insect pests, prevent frost, prevent lodging, prevent wind and rain), and wage a tenacious struggle against various possible natural disasters in the wheat growth process, avoid production reduction, or minimize losses. In arid areas in the north, wheat spring irrigation should be carefully carried out, and in southern areas, attention should be paid to drainage to prevent spring rain from causing disasters. In order to prevent wheat rust and wheat midges, which are highly harmful to wheat, all localities should rely on the masses to vigorously develop native pesticides and overcome the shortage of medicines and machinery. Since wheat is generally growing well this year, preventing lodging is an arduous task. To this end, early irrigation of turning green water and late irrigation of jointing water are necessary, and a large amount of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer should be applied in a timely manner, and all other effective methods should be adopted to promote strong stems.

The meeting believes that ensuring timely harvesting and getting the grains into the granary is a major task. If this link is not grasped tightly during the wheat maturity stage, great losses will be suffered. Therefore, from now on, all provinces and cities must assign dedicated personnel to prepare wheat harvesting tools, vigorously carry out tool reforms, and manufacture a large number of harvesting, threshing, and transportation tools. All provinces, prefectures, counties, and communes must establish wheat harvesting headquarters, study and formulate corresponding labor plans and cooperation contracts, so that grains can be stored in the granary during the wheat harvest, not a single ear is left in the field, and not a single grain is lost on the threshing ground. If the above work is neglected and strenuous efforts are not made to grasp each link, and a little is lost at each stage, a large number will be lost in the end. The meeting believes that in order to implement the above series of measures, in wheat field management, it is necessary to implement the method of having a commander on every road, a general in every direction, soldiers in every area, everyone responsible, and no loopholes in every plot, so as to achieve high yield per mu and overall bumper harvest.

The meeting believes that in order to strive to achieve "one season equals one year," special attention should be paid to strengthening the work of large-scale high-yield demonstration plots. Grasp the high-yield demonstration plots and drive the overall high yield of general fields. According to the statistics at the meeting, the yield indicators of the high-yield demonstration plots in various provinces and cities are generally more than double that of ordinary wheat fields. This is not only a high-yield base for promoting overall high yield and ensuring an even greater wheat harvest this year, striving to achieve "one season equals one year," but also prepares conditions for gradually implementing the policy of high yield, less planting, and more harvesting, and gradually realizing the great ideal of turning the land into a garden. Therefore, the meeting requires that double technical measures be taken for high-yield demonstration plots, scientifically meticulous management be carried out, an archive system be established, all crop production must have operating procedures, acceptance must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the procedures, and a responsibility system must be established and improved. High-yield demonstration plots should also be given priority to realize water conservancy, gardenization, mechanization, and electrification, and labor management quotas should be gradually increased.

The meeting reflected that while vigorously developing high-yield demonstration plots, mass agricultural scientific experiments and research work have been widely developed. This year, the wheat seed, soil, fertilizer, and irrigation comparison tests independently organized by the masses in various provinces and cities are of many types, which is of great benefit to further clarifying the wheat growth law. Therefore, the meeting requires all localities to carefully observe and record these tests, conscientiously summarize the experience, and submit the experience summaries to the Ministry of Agriculture before August 15.

The meeting believes that in order to ensure a greater wheat harvest and strive for "one season equals one year," it is necessary to adhere to the mass line, and widely carry out mass competitions for thousand-jin mu, thousand-jin teams, thousand-jin communes, thousand-jin counties, and thousand-jin special districts. In the movement, the secretaries of the party committees at all levels should take the lead, with dedicated personnel responsible at each level, specific leadership in each area, grasping to the end, and having a beginning and an end.

The meeting also discussed strengthening the field management of summer coarse grains and rapeseed, so that summer coarse grain crops and wheat can be treated equally, ensuring a comprehensive bumper harvest in summer. The meeting also exchanged views on carrying out spring sowing, especially cotton production, and carrying out large-scale livestock breeding movements. (Attached picture)

    水饱肥足  精心管理  过好拔节抽穗关和扬花灌浆关
    确保小麦穗穗长大粒粒饱满
    十省市小麦座谈会号召继续开展千斤竞赛，强调麦田管理要一抓到底
    新华社郑州24日电　2月19日到21日在郑州市举行的晋、冀、鲁、豫、陕、川、鄂、苏、皖、北京等十省、市小麦座谈会上，出席座谈会的十省、市主管小麦生产的负责干部，讨论了如何争取今年小麦更大丰收的问题。十省、市主管小麦生产的负责干部表示要力争实现“一季顶一年”，决心打好今年农业生产的第一仗，保证超额完成全年的农业增产任务。
    这次座谈会由中共中央政治局委员、书记处书记谭震林同志主持。中共中央农村工作部副部长、农业部部长廖鲁言，农业部副部长刘瑞龙等同志也参加了会议。
    这十个省、市是全国冬小麦的主要产区，这些地区今年的冬小麦占全国冬小麦面积的80％以上，其中大面积的丰产方占麦播面积的30％以上。今年，这些地区的小麦生长良好，大部地区麦苗正在返青，由山东半岛到关中平原；从黄河流域到长江两岸，数千里沃野上麦苗茁壮，一片葱绿，季节较早的四川盆地，小麦已经开始孕穗。
    据会上汇报，这十个省市的小麦今年播得早、种得好，田间管理也动手早、质量高。播种前，一般麦田都深翻一尺左右，有的达到一尺五到二尺以上，比往年深一倍到两倍。深翻面积占麦田总面积的80％以上。施底肥的数量一般也都比去年增加了三、四倍，普通麦田每亩施肥一万到两万斤，丰产田每亩施肥三万到五万斤以上。各地都普遍实行了密植，缩小了行距，下种量一般有二十五斤到三十斤，比往年增加一倍多，丰产田下种四十斤到八十斤以上，良种面积占冬播面积80％以上。绝大部分都进行了浸种拌种。为了及早防治地下虫，有些省在播种前还进行过土壤处理。小麦播种以后，各地都以一环扣一环，一抓到底的精神，开展了麦田管理运动。根据河北、河南、山东三个省不完全统计，投入麦田管理的劳力共有二千多万人，组织麦田管理专业队五十万个。目前，麦田追肥面积达90％以上，一般每亩追肥万斤左右，比去年同期增加三、四倍，丰产田每亩追肥三万到五万斤以上。冬灌面积比去年扩大一倍，现在各地正在准备春浇。由于认真加强了管理，使小麦胜利地度过了全苗关和越冬关。据各省、市麦苗排队的情况看，当前小麦生长的特点是：苗多、根深、茎粗。一类麦田平均占57％，每亩株数在五十万到八十万株以上，丰产方分蘖株数达一百万株以上。二类麦田占34.2％，每亩三十万株到五十万株左右。三类麦田占8.8％，每亩约二十万到三十万株。因此，今年小麦的生长特点是先天足后天管理抓得早。这些都为确保今年小麦更大丰收奠定了有力的物质基础。
    会议在分析了上述有利条件后，指出，虽然有了这些有利的条件，但是要力争实现“一季顶一年”（顶1957年一年）这个宏伟的指标，还须要进一步克服右倾保守思想，充分认识今年小麦生长的有利条件，鼓起更大的革命干劲，制订先进的指标和措施，凡是经过一切努力，能够办到的，就一定要办到。同时，又必须向那种满足于小麦生长良好而放松努力的自满麻痹思想作斗争。在克服了保守思想，群众性的生产高潮起来之后，自满麻痹思想就是争取今年小麦更大丰收的主要危险。因此，各地必须不断地和上述两种错误思想作斗争。现在，有许多地方已经重视了这个问题，通过查株数、查生长情况、查措施、算产量等办法，展开辩论，有力地驳倒了怀疑论和悲观论者，并克服了自满麻痹情绪，进一步调动了群众的积极性。
    小麦产量是由株数、穗数、粒数、粒重等几个因素构成的。因此，会议认为：要按照小麦生长规律，抓紧返青、拔节抽穗、扬花灌浆、收割等关键，达到“五增”（增株、增穗、增粒、增粒重、增产量）。今年各地小麦越冬关一般过得较好，当前主要是过好小麦返青关。各地丰产经验证明：返青关不仅是决定麦穗多少，而且还和穗子大小有关系；拔节和孕穗是保证茎秆健全发育、提高结实率的重要阶段；扬花和灌浆对保证粒大、粒饱有决定性的作用。因此，会议认为：在小麦的整个生长过程中，必须采取有效措施，一环扣一环，一抓到底，认真做到水饱肥足，精心管理，贯彻麦不收割，管理不停的精神。明确认识随着小麦生长，麦田管理的任务越来越重，工作要做得越来越细致。
    会议还着重研究了如何及早准备，做好“五防”（防旱涝、防病虫害、防霜冻、防倒伏、防风雨），并在小麦生长过程中和各种可能发生的自然灾害作顽强的斗争，避免减产，或使损失减少到最低限度。北方干旱地区，应该认真做好小麦春浇，南方地区要注意做好排涝工作，防止春雨成灾，为了防治对小麦危害性大的麦锈病和吸浆虫，各地要依靠群众大搞土农药，克服药械不足的困难。由于今年小麦普遍生长良好，防倒伏是一项艰巨的任务。为此，要早浇返青水、晚浇拔节水，适时的大量施磷、钾肥料和采用其他一切有效办法，促使茎秆粗壮。
    会议认为，保证及时收割，颗粒归仓是一项重大的任务，在小麦成熟阶段，如不抓紧这一环节，就要受很大损失。因此，各省、市从现在起就要固定专人进行麦收工具的准备，大搞工具改革，大量制造收割、脱粒、运输工具。各省、专、县和公社都要成立麦收指挥部，研究制订相应的劳力规划和协作合同，以便在麦收时颗粒归仓，地里一穗不留，场上一粒不丢。如果忽视上面这些工作，不抓住每个环节作艰苦的努力，每过一关，损失一点，就会损失很大一个数字。会议认为，为了贯彻上述一系列措施，在麦田管理上，必须实行路路有帅、方方有将、片片有兵、人人有责、块块不漏的办法，以达到亩亩高产，全面丰收。
    会议认为，要力争实现“一季顶一年”，应特别注意加强大面积丰产方的工作。抓住丰产方，带动一般田全面丰产。根据会议上的统计，各省、市丰产方的产量指标，一般都高过普通麦田一倍以上，这不仅是推动全面丰产确保今年小麦更大丰收，力争实现“一季顶一年”的高产基地，并且为逐步实行高产少种多收的方针和逐步实现大地园林化的伟大理想准备条件。因此，会议要求对丰产方要采取加倍的技术措施，科学地精心管理，建立档案制度，各种作物生产都要有操作规程，按照规程要求，实行验收，建立、健全责任制。对丰产方还应当优先实现水利化、园田化和机械化、电力化，要逐步提高劳动管理定额。
    会议反映，各地在大搞丰产方的同时，群众性的农业科学试验研究工作，得到了广泛的发展。今年各省、市群众自办的小麦种子、土壤、肥料、灌溉等对比试验，种类很多，这对于更进一步弄清小麦生长规律，有极大的好处。因此，会议要求各地要对这些试验详细地进行观察记载，认真总结经验，并在8月15日前，将经验总结报送农业部。
    会议认为，为了保证小麦更大丰收，力争“一季顶一年”，必须坚持贯彻执行群众路线，广泛开展群众性的小麦千斤亩，千斤队，千斤社，千斤县，千斤专区的竞赛运动。在运动中，要由各级党委书记挂帅，层层有专人负责，片片有具体领导，一抓到底，有始有终。
    会议还讨论了加强夏杂粮和油菜的田间管理问题，要使夏杂粮作物和小麦平起平坐，保证夏季全面大丰收。会议还对进行春播，特别是棉花生产，以及开展大家畜配种运动，交换了意见。（附图片）
