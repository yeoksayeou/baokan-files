New Machines, New Drive

By our correspondent Cao Baoming

Old Workers Become Novices

The No. 1 Rolling Mill of Daye Steel Plant has been completed. The workers are very excited.

In the past, they used large tongs to clamp red steel weighing two to three hundred catties on the old rolling mill, but now they only need to sit on the operating table with air conditioning and move the electric gate. Several tons of red steel "bang—dang, bang—dang" shuttle between the huge rolls, and are immediately rolled into steel billets of certain specifications. Not only that, this world-class rolling mill supplied by the German Democratic Republic also uses electronic and ionic control electrical equipment. If there is a fault anywhere, an alarm will sound and a red light will light up in the main electrical room. If the repair is not qualified, the black electric key cannot be restored. To start the main motor of several thousand horsepower, you only need to turn a small disc to automatically complete a series of preparations such as oil supply, ventilation, water supply, and starting the converter unit, and the motor starts smoothly... The workers all want to control the new machine and work hard. However, at the beginning of production, there were quite a few annoying things! The air and fire regulation of the soaking furnace was not good, the steel was burned, and thick and hard slag formed on the bottom of the furnace. The rolling mill was also difficult to operate. … Everyone was so anxious that they felt frustrated. The old workers on the old rolling mill became novices in front of the new rolling mill!

Some workers sighed and said: "It takes a year for a baby to walk, and half a year for a new machine to become normal!"

However, time waits for no one! Their steel production task this year has increased from 100,000 tons to 400,000 tons, while the design capacity of the No. 1 rolling mill is 370,000 tons of steel billets per year. This not only requires the No. 1 rolling mill to immediately start normal production, but also to quickly exceed its design capacity in order to adequately supply steel billets and complete this year's steel production task.

The task of the state excited the workers, and they immediately carried out "rectification on the battlefield" under the leadership of the Party branch. Everyone recalled the production situation on the old rolling mill and unanimously agreed:

"What determines production is people, not equipment."

Now that the equipment is new and the personnel are new, why can't we show new enthusiasm and quickly master new technologies? Everyone immediately proposed:

"Focus on familiarizing ourselves with equipment performance and skilled operation, and march towards technology!"

March Towards Technology

The slogan "March Towards Technology" immediately mobilized all employees.

Jing Xin'an, who has only elementary school education, wrote with great difficulty, as if he was "drawing dragons and painting phoenixes." When he was studying in Anshan, he kept thinking while writing: "My notebook is like Xue Rengui's wordless book and cannot be passed on to others." But at this time, he felt: "If only I master the technology, production will not be good!" He immediately handed over his notebook, along with the advanced experiences issued by Anshan, to the workers in the group for copying, so that everyone had a copy to study at any time. The automatic instrument of the soaking furnace has not been fully installed, and the furnace temperature is difficult to control, so he, Li Chuntang, and Li Rende recalled the experience of the Anshan师傅in watching the fire color, and through experiments, they worked out several operation methods.

Lei Dewan, the leader of the B shift’s large shear group, not only had not gone to Anshan to study, but was also sent to support steelmaking when the No. 1 rolling mill was put into production. He thought: "I can't even operate the hot shear, how can I be the group leader?" After finishing his work, he didn't even bother to take a bath, and immediately returned to the hot shear to see how others operated, and asked others if he didn't understand. After returning to his group, he also adopted the method of going to work early and delaying the end of work to observe the operation of the upper and lower shifts. Once, when rolling 130 mm square steel billets, others could handle it with ease, but he was the only one who was sweating profusely, unable to cut properly. He immediately asked Zhou Lianfu of the A shift: "How do you operate it?" He listened and watched, pondering for a long time before he suddenly realized: It turned out that these electrically controlled equipment all had a momentary starting process. When Lao Zhou turned on the front roller table with his left hand, he turned on the hot shear with his right hand. As soon as the steel billet was aligned with the size, the large shear fell and cut it off with a "?cha" sound. This is a matter of fractions of a second. But skilled workers don't even waste this little time. Lei Dewan learned at work and practiced after work, and finally made his operation also skilled. On January 17, he completed the task of shearing 335 tons of steel billets by himself in one shift.

At this time, the rolling mill operators were also implementing the method of "everywhere is production, everywhere is a classroom" under the goal of "roller table opening steadily, pushing bed pushing straight, and rolls pressing accurately," setting off a wave of mutual observation and mutual learning. Jia Fengcai and Zheng Qingfu, who were the most skilled in operation, also suggested that the leaders improve the width-to-height ratio of each rolling pass, which reduced the phenomenon of twisted steel and reduced the number of rolling passes for each steel from 23 to 17, greatly speeding up the rolling speed.

As a result of such diligent study and hard practice, the number of rolling mill operators who could work independently increased from four to twelve, and the number of hot shear drivers increased from one to eleven. Their production also increased from the highest daily output of more than 400 tons last year to more than 700 tons, and then to more than 970 tons.

Breaking Through Design Level

How to guarantee the completion of the annual production plan? The workers began to study the issue of exceeding the design capacity of the rolling mill.

The current key to production is that the rolling mill has great potential, but the red steel supply from the soaking furnace cannot keep up. According to the design, one furnace pit should hold 18 steel ingots, but no matter how they loaded them, they could only load 16. Zou Huatang, a seventh-grade old furnace worker in the A shift, thought about it day and night, and even drew on the ground and used matchsticks to arrange them, and finally came up with a plan to load more steel ingots. Could this plan work? He hesitated a bit, so he brought it up at the workshop meeting. Zheng Baorong, the young shift foreman of the B shift, said at the time: "Lao Zou, now it's our shift, we'll experiment for you." He immediately found Jing Xin'an and Zheng Qiyun, the leader of the loading group, to study the arrangement of the steel ingots and made some modifications so that one furnace pit could hold 20 steel ingots; 22 could be loaded during hot charging. The No. 1 rolling mill has eight furnace pits, and if each pit loads four more ingots, it is equivalent to adding two new furnace pits. Then, they also considered that in the past, the furnace cover had to be closed after all the steel ingots were loaded, and the furnace temperature dropped to more than 600 degrees. So they changed to closing the furnace cover every time a steel ingot was loaded. In this way, although the furnace cover driver was more troublesome, the furnace temperature could be maintained at around 800 degrees, saving nearly half an hour of heating time for each furnace of steel ingots.

At this time, the leaders and everyone decided together: to further strengthen organization and scheduling, and to conduct a production test exceeding the design capacity on the 23rd.

On this day, everyone was very nervous. The workers of the C shift started production from 12 o'clock at night, and learned from the experience of the B shift, sending one person to stand in front of the furnace platform. As soon as he saw the first red steel entering the first rolling pass, he would direct the second red steel to leave the furnace. In this way, as soon as the previous steel billet was rolled, the second red steel would be delivered to the rolling mill, without letting the rolling mill wait for the red steel, or letting the red steel wait for the rolling mill. Li Ligong, the roll operator, also suggested reducing the number of rolling passes from 17 to 15 to shorten the rolling time. The workers of the A shift, who were supposed to take over at 7 o'clock in the morning, rushed to the factory at 3 or 4 o'clock before dawn to observe the operation of the C shift and apply these experiences to their own shift. Chen Xinwei, the pushing bed operator, also cleverly started the pushing bed in advance, and when the red steel was rolled over, he would flip it over and send it to the next rolling pass, without letting the rolls idle. The workers of the B shift, who took over at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, also came in the morning to learn from the experience of the A shift, and further organized the movements of the roller table, pushing bed, and rolls more closely. As soon as the red steel was delivered, the pushing bed would catch it and send it into the rolling pass. The three of them coordinated their movements as if one person was operating, very accurately and very quickly. In this way, production in each shift surpassed the previous one: the C shift rolled 172 steel billets, the A shift rolled 184 steel billets, and the B shift rolled even more, 194 steel billets!

The dispatch room calculated: a total of 1,321 tons of steel billets were rolled this day, exceeding the design capacity of the rolling mill by 11%, marking the first shot for completing the annual plan!

    新机器  新干劲
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    老工人成了新手
    大冶钢厂的初轧机建成了。工人们都非常兴奋。
    他们过去都在旧轧机上用大钳夹住两三百斤重的红钢操作，而现在只需坐在有冷气装置的操作台上，搬动电闸，几吨重的红钢就“咣—当，咣—当”地在巨大的轧辊间穿来穿去，马上轧成了一定规格的钢坯。不仅这样，这台由德意志民主共和国供应的世界第一流的轧钢机，还是用电子和离子控制电气设备。任何地方出了故障，主电室都会响起警号和亮起红灯。如果检修得不合格，那黑色的电键也推不还原。开动几千马力的主马达，也只需转动一个小圆盘，就能使通油、通风、通水和起动变流机组等一系列的准备工作，都自动完成，马达顺利开动……。工人们都想驾驭着新机器大干一番。但是，刚开始生产，却有不少恼人事儿！均热炉的风火调节不好，钢给烧化了，炉底结上又厚又硬的渣子。轧机也操纵不好。……大家急得心里直窝火。旧轧钢机上的老工人，在新轧机面前成了新手！
    有的工人叹了口气说：“毛孩走路要一岁，新机正常得半年！”
    但是，时间不等人！他们今年的钢材生产任务由十万吨增加为四十万吨，而初轧机的设计能力是年产三十七万吨钢坯。这就不仅要求初轧机马上正常生产，而且要迅速超过设计能力，才能充足供应钢坯，完成今年钢材生产任务。
    国家的任务，使工人们激动起来，立即在党支部领导下进行“战地整风”。大家回忆了当初在旧轧机上的生产情况，一致认为：
    “决定生产的是人，而不是设备。”
    现在设备新，人员新，为什么不能拿出新的干劲来，迅速掌握新技术呢？大家马上提出：
    “以熟悉设备性能和熟练操作为主，向技术进军！”
     向技术进军
    “向技术进军”的口号，立即将全体职工调动起来了。
    小学文化程度的景心安，写字就像“描龙画凤”似的，很艰难。他在鞍山学习时，就一边记一边想：“我这笔记本就像薛仁贵的无字天书，不能传人。”但他这时感到：“光我一人掌握了技术，也搞不好生产啊！”马上将他的笔记本连同鞍山印发的先进经验，都交给组里的工人传抄，做到人手一册，随时研究。均热炉的自动仪表还没有完全安装起来，炉温很难控制，他就同李春堂、李仁德一起回忆鞍山师傅看火色的经验，并通过试验，订出几条操作法来。
    乙班大剪组长雷德万不仅没去鞍山学习过，在初轧机投入生产时，还被派出去支援炼钢了。他想：“我连热剪机都不会开，这组长咋干？”他工作完了澡也顾不上洗，就马上回到热剪机旁看别人怎样操作，不懂的就请教别人。他回到本组后，也采取提前上班和延迟下班的办法，观摩上下两班的操作。有一次轧一百三十米厘的方钢坯，别人都能应付自如，就他一人忙得满头大汗，剪切不应。他马上去请教甲班的周连甫：“你是咋操作的？”他一边听一边看，揣摸了半天，才恍然大悟：原来，这些电力操纵的设备都有个瞬息间的起动过程。老周在左手开动前滚道的时候，右手就开动热剪机，钢坯刚对好尺寸，大剪就落下来，“?嚓”一声切断了。这是多少分之一秒的事儿。但熟练的工人就连这点时间也不空过。雷德万就上班学，下班练，终于使自己的操作也开始熟练，在1月17日一人一班完成了剪切三百三十五吨钢坯的任务。
    这时，轧机操作工们也在“滚道开的稳，推床推的正，轧辊压的准”的目标下，实行“处处搞生产，处处是课堂”的办法，掀起了相互观摩、相互学习的热潮。操作最熟练的贾凤才、郑庆福，还建议领导上将每次压轧的宽高比例加以改进，减少了压扭钢的现象，并且使每根钢由压轧二十三次减为十七次，大大地加快了压轧速度。
    这样勤学苦练的结果，能独立工作的轧机操纵工就由四人增为十二人，热剪机司机更由一人增为十一人。他们的生产，也由去年最高日产四百多吨升为七百多吨，再增为九百七十多吨。
    突破设计水平
    怎样保证完成全年的生产计划呢？工人们开始研究超过轧机设计能力的问题。
    当前的生产关键是轧机潜力大，均热炉的红钢供应不上。按照设计，一个炉坑应装十八根钢锭，而他们左装右装，怎么也只能装十六根。甲班的七级老炉工邹化堂就白天想、黑夜想，还在地上画，用火柴棍儿摆，终于想出了一个多装钢锭的方案。这方案能不能行呢？他有些犹豫，便在工段会议上提了出来。年轻的乙班工长郑保荣当时就讲：“老邹，现在是我们当班，我们替你试验。”他马上找景心安和装入机组长郑启云研究，将钢锭的摆法又作了些修改，做到一个炉坑装二十根钢锭；热装时还能装二十二根。初轧机有八个炉坑，以一坑多装四根计算，就等于新增加了两个炉坑。接着，他们又考虑到过去要装完一炉钢锭才关炉盖，炉温下降到六百多度，便改为装一根钢锭关一次炉盖。这样，虽然炉盖司机麻烦些，但炉温却能保持八百来度，每炉钢锭可节省将近半小时的加温时间。
    这时，领导上便同大家一起决定：进一步加强组织和调度工作，在23日作一次超过设计能力的生产试验。
    这天，大家都非常紧张。丙班工人从夜里十二点钟开始生产，便学习乙班的经验，派一人站在炉台前面，他一看见前根红钢刚进第一道轧槽，就指挥第二根红钢出炉。这样，前根钢坯刚轧完，第二根红钢就恰好送到轧机跟前，不让轧机等红钢，也不让红钢等轧机。轧辊操纵工李立功还建议将压轧次数由十七次减为十五次，缩短压轧时间。该在早晨七点接班的甲班工人，三、四点钟天不亮就赶进厂来，观摩丙班的操作，把这些经验都用到自己班上。推床操纵工陈新位还巧妙地事先起动推床，等红钢一轧过来，就翻它个滚儿，往下道轧槽送，不让轧辊空转。下午三点钟接班的乙班工人，也提前在上午就来学习甲班的经验，并进一步将滚道、推床、轧辊的动作组织得更紧密。红钢一送过来，推床就接住，往轧槽里送，三人协同动作得就像一人在操纵一样，很准确，很敏捷。这样，生产也一班赛过一班：丙班轧出钢坯一百七十二根，甲班就轧出一百八十四根，乙班更轧出一百九十四根！
    调度室计算了一下：这天共轧出钢坯一千三百二十一吨，超过了轧机设计能力11％，为完成全年计划打响了第一炮！
