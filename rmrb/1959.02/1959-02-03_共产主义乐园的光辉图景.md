    The Glorious Vision of Communist Paradise
    To the Editor:
    After reading Comrade Khrushchev's report on the control figures for the development of the Soviet national economy at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, I was greatly inspired. The communist paradise, once dreamed of by people and pursued by countless martyrs who gave their lives for it, has been unveiled by the Soviet people with the brilliance of their labor and wisdom. The vast liberated people are about to follow this path and strive forward. What could be more exciting than this?
    The realization of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan will not only further strengthen the Soviet Union's economic power and make the lives of the Soviet people even better, but it will also greatly strengthen the power of the socialist camp and provide a reliable guarantee for the cause of world peace. Therefore, this plan has been warmly welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world, and only a handful of warmongers feel panicked and frightened.
    As a Chinese person in the socialist camp, I cannot help but be encouraged by the brilliant picture of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan, and I cannot help but shout loudly: Long live communism!
    I am following the proceedings of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with unparalleled concern, and I sincerely congratulate the congress, which will become a milestone for the Soviet people towards communism, on its brilliant victory. I believe that every one of my compatriots must share the same excitement as I do, and extend brotherly greetings to the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people.

    共产主义乐园的光辉图景
    编辑同志：
    读了赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会上作的关于苏联发展国民经济控制数字的报告后，大为振奋。曾经是人们幻想着的、无数先烈为之献出生命追求的共产主义乐园，已经被苏联人民用劳动智慧的光辉揭开了序幕。广大被解放了的人民，即将循着这个道路奋斗前进。有什么能比这更激动人心呢。
    苏联七年计划的实现，不仅将进一步增强苏联的经济力量，使苏联人民的生活更加美好，而且将大大加强社会主义阵营的威力，使世界和平事业得到可靠的保障。因此这个计划受到全世界爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎，只有一小撮战争贩子才感到惊慌害怕。
    作为社会主义阵营中的一个中国人，不能不被苏联七年计划灿烂的图景所鼓舞，不能不高声欢呼：共产主义万岁！
    我以无比的关心注视着苏共二十一次代表大会的进行，并且衷心地祝贺将成为苏联人民迈向共产主义的里程碑的大会获得辉煌的胜利。我相信我国的每一个同胞都一定和我怀着同样兴奋的心情，向伟大的苏联共产党和苏联人民致以兄弟般的敬礼。
