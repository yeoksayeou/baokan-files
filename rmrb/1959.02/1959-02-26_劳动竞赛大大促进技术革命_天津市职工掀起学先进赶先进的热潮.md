    Labor Competition Greatly Promotes Technological Revolution
    Tianjin Workers Launch a Surge of Learning from and Catching Up with the Advanced

    (Report from Tianjin Daily) Since the Spring Festival, under the leadership of the Party Committee, the vast number of workers on the Tianjin industrial front have rapidly launched a labor competition movement centered on technological revolution with the force of a thunderbolt. Many factories, in the spirit of making economic work more and more meticulous, have strengthened specific leadership over the competition, seized the key issues in the factory, workshop, and team production, and proposed clear competition directions, which have powerfully promoted the technological revolution movement and become a huge driving force for completing the first quarter's leap forward plan.

    Around the time of the labor competition mobilization meeting held by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, all districts held skill competitions and oath-taking rallies, establishing some advanced factories and teams as benchmarks, setting up arenas, and mobilizing a surge of comparing with, learning from, and catching up with the advanced. At the same time, all districts organized the vast number of workers to study the initiative of the municipal-level labor models of 1958, and vigorously publicized the thoughts and deeds of advanced collectives and advanced individuals. Most factories in all districts have also determined benchmarks within the factory, mobilized everyone to learn, catch up, and ensure that "every team has a pacesetter, and everyone has a competitor." After a series of publicity and mobilization work, the vast majority of factories' workshops and teams have formulated competition plans for comparing with, learning from, and catching up with the advanced. In the Hedong District, about one hundred and eight factories and more than two thousand teams exchanged challenge and response conditions. In every corner of the entire industrial front, a hot scene of mutual challenge, chasing each other, and competing to surpass quickly appeared, truly "the spring breeze brings flowers for thousands of miles," and the spring of the even greater leap forward year is indeed extraordinary.

    In major industries such as steel rolling, electricity, paper making, and textiles, the factories manufacturing irrigation and drainage equipment, and all foundry workers in the city, a heated competition of the same industry, the same type of work, and the same product was launched, and quickly developed within the factory. In the paper industry, the workers of the First and Second Workshops of the Tianjin Paper Mill accepted the friendly challenge of the First Paper Mill and proposed the slogan of learning from the First Paper Mill and catching up with the First Paper Mill, striving to be the first in the Hexi District. As soon as the First Workshop proposed to overproduce 250 tons of paper in the first quarter, the Second Workshop immediately proposed to strive to overproduce 300 tons of paper. In order to realize the competition conditions and strive to move ahead of the Second Workshop, the workers of the First Workshop intensified their operational improvements. The municipal-level model team—the Youth No. 1 Machine Team—implemented hot air exhaust measures and increased the speed of the machine from the original 125 meters per minute to 131 meters. A competition upsurge of "learning from No. 1 machine, catching up with No. 1 machine" was launched among the teams within this workshop, striving to reach 140 meters or even 150 meters. Among the textile mills, a competition of comparing, learning, and catching up was also launched. The First Cotton Mill proposed to learn the quality of the Third and Fifth Mills and catch up with the output of the Second Mill; the Tianjin Knitting Factory wanted to compare advanced indicators with the First, Third, and Fifth Cotton Mills. In the Second Cotton Mill, the spinning workers were urgently chasing and catching up with Gao Yunlan, a high-speed spinning expert. In the competition of comparing, learning, and catching up, more than 100 female workers in the Third Spinning Workshop of this factory, with the help of Gao Yunlan, quickly shortened their yarn joining speed from more than four seconds to three and a half seconds, reaching the advanced level in the city, while Gao Yunlan's own yarn joining speed was further shortened to two and a half seconds.

    The mass upsurge of comparing, learning from, and catching up with the advanced has greatly promoted the development of technological revolution. Many factories, focusing on the requirements of comprehensively completing the national plan, emphasized completing product output, quality, new products, and reducing costs, and mobilized workers to work hard, diligently, and cleverly. After many factories in Hedong District put forward the slogan of "learning from the Boiler Factory and catching up with the Boiler Factory," the workers of the Tianjin Boiler Factory, as a municipal model factory, were determined to create greater achievements in terms of faster implementation of technological measures, higher labor productivity, solving more key problems, and saving more steel. The workers in the General Workshop alone proposed and implemented more than 50 technical innovation measures. The fourth team in this workshop changed the drilling of the mine carts to punching, which increased efficiency tenfold.

    In the competition of comparing, learning from, and catching up with the advanced, many factories, workshops, teams, and individuals have developed a communist spirit of collaboration in order to jointly improve production. In the competition of comparing, learning from, and catching up among the four teams in the wire drawing workshop of the electrolytic copper factory, although they were competing against each other, the second team saw that the fourth team's output was low, so they took the initiative to support the fourth team with the main tools they had prepared, which quickly increased the fourth team's output. In many factories, advanced teams and model individuals are carefully passing on good technical experience and helping everyone improve production in the competition.

    劳动竞赛大大促进技术革命
    天津市职工掀起学先进赶先进的热潮
    本报讯　据天津日报消息：春节过后，天津市全市工业战线广大职工，在党委领导下，以雷霆万钧之势，迅速掀起了以技术革命为中心的劳动竞赛运动。许多工厂本着经济工作愈做愈细致的精神，加强了对竞赛的具体领导，抓住了厂里、车间、小组生产中的关键问题，提出明确的竞赛方向，有力地推进了技术革命运动，成为完成第一季度跃进计划的巨大动力。
    在市总工会举行的劳动竞赛动员大会的前后，各区都分别召开了比武、誓师大会，把一些先进工厂和小组立作标杆，大摆擂台，动员掀起比先进，学先进，赶先进的热潮。同时，各区组织广大职工学习了1958年市级劳动模范的倡议书，大张旗鼓地宣传了先进集体，先进人物的思想和事迹。各区大多数工厂也都确定了厂内标杆，发动大家学习，追赶，作到了“组组有标兵，人人有对手”，经过一系列的宣传动员工作，绝大多数工厂的车间、小组都订出了比先进、学先进、赶先进的竞赛计划。在河西区，约有一百零八个工厂，两千多个小组互相递送了挑战、应战条件。在整个工业战线的各个角落，都迅速出现了互相叫阵、你追我赶、竞相超越的热烈场面，真是“春风一日花千里”，更大跃进年的春天毕竟不寻常。
    在轧钢、电力、造纸、纺织等主要行业、承制排灌设备的各厂和全市铸工中，展开了热火朝天的同行业、同工种、同产品竞赛，并且迅速向厂内发展。在造纸行业里，天津造纸总厂第一、二两车间职工接受了造纸一厂的友谊挑战，提出学造纸一厂、赶造纸一厂的口号，要在河西区力争第一。这个厂第一车间刚提出要在第一季度超额生产纸张二百五十吨，第二车间马上又提出要力争超额生产纸张三百吨。为了实现竞赛条件，力争走到第二车间前面去，一车间工人们加紧改进操作，市级模范小组——青年一号机小组实现了热排风措施，提高了车速，由原来每分钟产纸一百二十五公尺提高到一百三十一公尺。这个车间内部各小组之间又掀起了“学一号机、赶一号机”的竞赛热潮，力争达到一百四十公尺甚至一百五十公尺。在各纺织厂之间，也展开了比、学、赶竞赛。棉纺一厂提出了要学三厂、五厂的质量，赶二厂的产量；天津市针织厂要和棉纺一、三、五厂比指标先进。在棉纺二厂里，细纱工人们急追猛赶高速纺纱能手高云兰。这个厂的三纺场一百多名女工们在比、学、赶竞赛中，经过高云兰的帮助，接头速度很快都由四秒以上缩短到三秒五，达到市内的先进水平，而高云兰自己的接头速度又缩短到二秒五。
    群众性的比、学、赶先进的竞赛热潮，大大促进了技术革命的开展。许多工厂围绕全面完成国家计划要求，强调完成产品产量、质量、新产品和降低成本计划，动员职工实干苦干巧干。当河东区许多工厂提出“学锅炉厂、赶锅炉厂”的口号以后，作为市模范厂的天津市锅炉厂的职工们，以技术革命为中心，立志要在技术措施实现快、劳动生产率高、解决关键问题多、节约钢材多等方面创造更大的成绩。只通用车间职工就提出并实现了五十多项技术革新措施，这个车间第四组把矿车的钻眼改为冲眼，一下就提高效率十倍。
    在比、学、赶先进的竞赛中，许多工厂、车间、小组和个人之间，为了共同提高生产，大兴共产主义协作之风。在电解铜厂拔丝车间四个小组开展比、学、赶竞赛中，虽然相互是竞赛对手，但二组看到四组产量较低，就主动把本组准备好的主要工具支援给四组，使四组产量迅速增长。在许多工厂里，先进小组和模范人物都在竞赛当中，向别人仔细传授好的技术经验，帮助大家提高生产。
