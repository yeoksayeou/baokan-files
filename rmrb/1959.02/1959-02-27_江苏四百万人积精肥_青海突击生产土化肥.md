    Nanjing, February 26th (report from this newspaper) - In Jiangsu province, over four million people are extensively collecting high-quality and organic fertilizers.
    All areas of the province are engaged in intensive fertilizer collection as a basic construction activity, accumulating large quantities of human and animal waste. For example, in the Huduo Township of the Dongfeng People's Commune in Jianhu County, which consists of 1,275 boat-dwelling households, most of the human waste was previously thrown into the water. Now, every boat has added chamber pots; simultaneously, four boats have been fixed in place on the water, specifically for the boat dwellers to empty their chamber pots. Recently, the commune also constructed 37 new pig farms, increasing the number of pigs by 3,576; and constructed 1,975 toilets in the fields, as well as 258 new manure pits. Due to the emphasis placed on manure management by leaders and the masses, the daily collection of human and animal waste has increased from 30,000 dan to over 72,000 dan. In Pi County's Yunhe Commune, three urine collection teams have even been organized. In Hongqi Commune of the same county, in just half a month, 13,000 toilets, urine jars, urine pools, and manure pits were added, greatly increasing the collection of manure.
    This year, Jiangsu province has over 6.5 million mu of winter green manure. In the fertilizer accumulation movement, various localities have adopted measures such as ditching for drainage, applying additional fertilizer, and using fertilizer to nourish fertilizer, to effectively strengthen the field management of green manure. For example, in Yangzhong County, over 63,000 mu of green manure has had smoked soil and pig and sheep ash and other warm fertilizers applied four times. Changshu County has planted a total of over 490,000 mu of green manure this year. Before the Spring Festival, each mu was given 100 dan of winter fertilizer, and drainage ditches were opened in every field to ensure dryness after rain.
    Jiangsu province plans to rot 8 billion dan of grass and pond mud this year, averaging about 67 dan per mu. Currently, all localities have taken action. For example, Wujiang County has opened over 85,000 fertilizer ponds in the fields and used 470,000 dan of rice straw to rot a large amount of grass and pond mud. In order to store enough base fertilizer for early rice seedling fields, ash storage houses and ash jars have been widely established in various places to collect and store large amounts of plant ash. Liyang County has built a shed in every canteen specifically for storing plant ash, and has already collected 250,000 dan of plant ash.
    In the fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing movement, various localities have also implemented the principle of "using local materials, manufacturing locally, prioritizing soil, and combining local and foreign methods," and have manufactured large quantities of local chemical fertilizers. In Binhai County, the communes have established over 4,000 local chemical fertilizer plants, which have produced over 450,000 jin of various local chemical fertilizers. In Qidong County's Xinyi Commune, a "long march" of over a hundred people was recently organized to set up camp on the Yellow Sea coast and extensively collect salt mud from the beach.
    While Jiangsu province is extensively accumulating high-quality fertilizer, it is also continuing to extensively collect coarse fertilizers such as river mud, garbage, and smoked soil in conjunction with water conservancy construction and environmental sanitation, ensuring that both coarse and fine fertilizers are given equal importance. For example, in Yancheng County, a fertilizer accumulation army of 200,000 laborers has been formed, adopting the method of advancing on five fronts and combining ten aspects of fertilizer accumulation, accumulating over 120 million dan of high-quality fertilizer and mud-mixed fertilizer in ten days, ensuring that each of the county's 630,000 mu of crops such as wheat and rapeseed receives over 300 dan of topdressing fertilizer per mu.

    Xining, February 26th (report from this newspaper) - While extensively accumulating household fertilizer, the people of Qinghai province are also stepping up the production of local chemical fertilizers and the propagation of bacterial fertilizers. Currently, all communes have formulated fertilizer production and application plans, generally requiring an average application of 500 jin of local chemical fertilizer and 4 jin of bacterial fertilizer per mu of food crops. According to statistics, the 74 people's communes in Qinghai province's agricultural areas have over 10,000 local chemical fertilizer plants, most of which were established successively in the summer and autumn of last year. These plants have recently undergone rectification and expansion.
    Qinghai province has abundant sources of fertilizer such as nitre soil, peat, and animal bones, which are favorable conditions for mass production of local chemical fertilizers. Recently, the Qinghai Provincial Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences has also cultivated a batch of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and phosphate bacteria strains, distributed them to various counties, and vigorously imparted the technology of propagating bacterial fertilizers.
    In order to promote mass production of local chemical fertilizers and bacterial fertilizers, the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Chemical Industry Bureau recently jointly organized a local chemical fertilizer testing training class to train local chemical fertilizer testing personnel for each county, so that each commune can independently identify the composition of various local chemical fertilizers and apply fertilizer according to the needs of the soil and crops.

    江苏四百万人积精肥
    青海突击生产土化肥
    本报南京26日电　江苏省四百多万人大积精肥和有机肥。
    全省各地正在大搞积肥基本建设，大量积聚人畜粪便。如建湖县东风人民公社的湖垛镇有一千二百七十五户船民，以往所有人粪尿绝大多数都抛撒在水中，现在每个船上都增添了马桶；同时在水上固定四只船，专门供船民倒马桶。最近，全社又新建养猪场三十七个，增加生猪三千五百七十六头；并在田头修建厕所一千九百七十五处，新砌粪坑二百五十八个。由于领导和群众都重视粪便管理，人畜粪便由每日积聚三万担增到七万二千多担。邳县运河公社，还组织了三个积尿队。该县红旗公社仅半个月就增加厕所、尿罐、尿池、粪坑一万三千个，大量积攒粪便。
    今年，江苏全省共有冬绿肥六百五十多万亩。在积肥运动中，各地采取了开沟排水、追施肥料、以肥养肥等措施，切实加强了绿肥的田间管理。如扬中县六万三千多亩绿肥已追施熏土、猪羊灰等暖性肥料四次。常熟县今年共种绿肥四十九万多亩，春节前，每亩已追腊肥一百担，并在块块田里都开了排水沟，保证雨住田干。
    江苏全省今年要求沤制草塘泥八十亿担，平均每亩地约有六十七担，现在各地已普遍行动起来。如吴江县在田头开积肥塘八万五千多个，并用四十七万担稻草沤制了大量草塘泥。为了给早稻秧田储足基肥，各地都普遍建立了灰库、灰缸，收集和储藏大量草木灰。溧阳县每个食堂都搭了一个草棚子，专门储藏草木灰，目前已收集草木灰二十五万担。
    在积肥造肥运动中，各地还贯彻了“就地取材，就地制造，以土为主，土洋并举”的方针，制造了大量的土化肥。滨海县各公社办起的土化肥厂就有四千多个，已生产出各种土化肥四十五万多斤。启东县新义公社，最近组织了百余人的远征军，扎营黄海边，大搞海滩咸泥。
    江苏各地在大积精肥的同时，结合兴修水利和环境卫生工作，继续大搞河泥、垃圾和熏土等粗肥，做到粗肥与细肥并重。如盐城县有二十万劳力组成积肥大军，采取五路进军、十结合的积肥办法，十天就积精肥和泥杂肥一亿二千多万担。保证了全县六十三万亩三麦、油菜等作物每亩有追肥三百担以上。
    本报西宁26日电　青海省人民在大积家肥的同时，抓紧了土化肥的生产和细菌肥料的繁育。目前，各公社都订了造肥施肥计划，普遍要求粮食作物每亩平均施土化肥五百斤，菌肥四斤。据统计，青海省农业区的七十四个人民公社共有土化肥厂一万多个，大部是在去年夏秋季陆续办起来的，这些厂最近都经过整顿和扩建。
    青海省有着丰富的硝土、泥炭和兽骨等肥源，这是大量生产土化肥的有利条件。最近，青海省农林科学研究所又培植了一批固氮菌和磷细菌的菌种，分送给各县，并大力传授繁育菌肥的技术。
    为了促进群众性的土化肥和菌肥的生产，青海省农林厅和化工局最近合办了一个土化肥化验训练班，给各县培训土化肥化验人员，使各公社都能自行鉴定各种土化肥的成分，针对土壤和作物需要来施肥。
