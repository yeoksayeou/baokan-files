Overcoming the Mystical View of Reviewing Natural Science Books and Periodicals
Science Publishing House, Tián Fū

The work of reviewing natural science books and periodicals is very important, especially because the number of publications in this area is increasing daily, and their influence is growing. Carrying out book reviews, recommending good books, and criticizing bad books is a key issue in guiding publishing work to better serve readers. However, judging from the book publication situation in recent years, there has been basically no review work. The review work for other science and technology books and periodicals is also not much, which is indeed a problem that must be solved.

The main reason why this work has not been carried out well in the past, we believe, is that we have not emancipated our minds and have mystified the work of reviewing books and periodicals, especially in the field of natural sciences, thinking that "reviewing" an academic work is extraordinary. That is to say, it must have specialized knowledge. This is a misunderstanding. For example, many ordinary readers have helped us discover some more serious problems in books, such as some books reflecting the bourgeois academic orientation and research methods that are divorced from reality, the tendency to "value the ancient and despise the present," and other political errors, which are precisely the most fundamental problems in scientific publications, and it is very beneficial to point these out. Of course, more work is needed by people with specialized knowledge on some academic issues and narrative method issues involved in the specific content. Secondly, book reviews and academic discussions on content are related, but they should also be distinguished. Some people think that "reviewing" requires lengthy discussions, which is one-sided and will affect mass book review activities. We support in-depth academic discussions, and also advocate concise and clear reviews, even of a few hundred words, so that more people have the opportunity to express their opinions. Of course, the incorrect view that writing book reviews will "offend people," etc., is becoming less and less common, and will become even less in the future. In addition, in the past, book reviews relied only on a few experts, which was of course not comprehensive. To do this work well in the future, it is necessary without exception to put politics in command and follow the mass line, that is, to proceed from the interests of the broad masses of readers, take the Party's guidelines and policies as the standard, implement the three-way combination of authors, editors, and readers, and carry out mass book review work. This will definitely be done well.

There are some practical problems in carrying out book review work. In the past, there were fewer venues for publishing reviews (especially in natural sciences), and there was a lack of organized activities. We very much hope that various newspapers and periodicals will strengthen book review work and publish more manuscripts reviewing natural science books and periodicals. We also plan to gradually open up special columns for book and periodical reviews in appropriate publications among the nearly one hundred scientific journals published by the Science Publishing House. In addition, we will also try to carry out the necessary organizational work and create some favorable conditions. However, the most important thing is the strong support of the broad masses of readers and scientific workers.

    破除评论自然科学书刊的神秘观点
    科学出版社　田夫
    自然科学书刊的评介工作非常重要，特别是因为这方面书刊的出版量日益增多，影响也越来越大。开展书评工作，推荐好书，批评坏书，是指导出版工作更好地为读者服务的一个关键问题。可是从近年来的出书情况看，基本上没有进行评介工作。其他方面的科技书刊评介工作也是不多的，这确是一个必须解决的问题。
    这个工作过去所以没有开展得好，我们认为主要原因之一，还是没有解放思想，把书刊评介工作、特别是自然科学方面的书刊评介工作神秘化了，认为要“评”一本学术著作非同寻常。这就是说，一定要有专门学识。这是一种误解。比方说，许多普通的读者就帮助过我们发现了一些书中比较严重的问题，如有的书中反映出脱离实际的资产阶级学术方向和研究方法，“厚古薄今”的倾向，以及其他政治性的错误，而这些恰恰是科学出版物中的最根本性的问题，指出这些大有好处。当然，在具体内容涉及的一些学术上的问题、叙述方法问题，是需要具有专门学识的人做更多工作的。其次，书评和内容上的学术讨论是相关的，但也应有所区别。有人以为要“评”就得长篇大论，这种看法有片面性，而且会影响到群众性的书刊评论活动。我们赞成深入的学术讨论，也提倡简洁明确的以至几百个字的评论，使更多的人有表示意见的机会。当然，认为写书评会“得罪人”等等的不正确看法已经不多，今后更会少起来。此外，过去搞书评，只依靠少数专家，这当然是不全面的。今后要做好这工作，也无例外地必须政治挂帅，走群众路线，就是从广大读者的利益出发，以党的方针政策为标准，实行作者、编者、读者三结合，开展群众性的评书工作，这样是一定能做得好的。
    开展书评工作有一些实际问题，过去发表评论的园地（特别是自然科学方面）较少，缺少组织活动。我们非常希望各个报刊加强书评工作，多发表一些评论自然科学书刊的稿件。我们也打算在科学出版社出版的近一百种科学期刊中间，逐步在适当的刊物上开辟书刊评介专栏。另外也设法进行必要的组织工作，创造一些便利条件。但是，最主要的，还是需要广大读者、科学工作者的大力支持。
