(Belgrade News) The Yugoslav "News" recently published an article entitled "Ways to Make Money." From this article, one can understand what social life is like in Yugoslavia. The full text of the article is as follows:

    A painter has a preschool-aged son. The business director of a winery called the artist, asking him to quickly paint a sign for a new product of the factory. At that time, the child was drawing curves on paper with a pencil, and he himself did not know what these curves meant. The next day, the painter asked his son to draw curves with a black chalk, and then paint some parts with yellow and black colors. On the same afternoon, he handed over this painting to the business director of the factory as a sign for the new product. A few days later, this sign was printed in millions of copies, and the painter received 250,000 dinars from the winery as remuneration for his son's painting.

    In Belgrade, an architect arranged a small exhibition and earned 99,000 dinars in one day; in Zagreb, the manager of a small film studio took leave without pay, and then signed a film contract with his own company. Within two weeks, he earned 200,000 dinars; in Ljubljana, an economist simultaneously served as an honorary consultant for several Slovenian factories, and in addition to his regular salary, he received about 55,000 dinars from each factory every month...

    This phenomenon prompted us to conduct a small-scale investigation to try to determine, at least in some cases, how much some people earn and how they earn it. We must admit that our attempt uncovered far more situations than we had originally anticipated. We found that individualists, artists, and pseudo-artists have many ways to earn easy money, and some people can earn more money overnight than the most skilled people in their industry. We also believe that to earn this kind of money, people do not need to be famous or talented. It is enough to be smart.

    Zagreb architect B.U. is not as well-known in the architectural field as his old colleagues. However, in business and in terms of money earned, he surpasses many of the most famous people in the architectural world. In his field, he is an expert in interior construction and has some reputation, but people who know him better say that B.U. is just a smart young man who organizes his business very well and knows how to make a lot of money. At every Zagreb Fair, he earns millions whenever arranging exhibition halls and booths. The vast majority of Zagreb's artistic construction business is done by his unregistered small enterprise. Ten architectural students and just as many art students, sculptors, masons, and carpenters work for him. Architect B.U. undertakes the work of renovating ten large buildings in Zagreb, each renovation costing three million, five million, ten million, or even more dinars. In the Zagreb business community, the young architect is so famous that (no one knows why) the Zagreb Chamber of Commerce suggested that he be responsible for renovating the Republic Building and other major buildings in the city center.

    The young architect has his own yacht and car, and lives a very lavish life. People in his industry say that B.U. is much better as a businessman than as an architect. He failed statics at the University of Zagreb, so he transferred to the University of Ljubljana, and even today, he is still taking exams at the University of Ljubljana. People who know him say that B.U. doesn't know much about design; others design for him, and he only takes care of the management and collects the money.

    In Zagreb, there are also several young architects who have made big business, running many enterprises in Zagreb and Croatia. These enterprises are in fact well-organized small businesses. These enterprises hire employees to work, while their young and smart bosses make a lot of money.

    In our investigation, we further emphasized that sometimes there are some reputable and well-known designers in these industries. The former director of the Zagreb Urban Construction Bureau, architect B.P., organized his own small enterprise in his own bureau. That is to say, he signed private contracts to make municipal construction plans for ten small cities, and he hired people from his own bureau to do this. The head only organizes and supervises the business, while others do the design and planning work. When the business began to develop, the director of the Urban Construction Bureau opened his own account at the Zagreb National Bank to deposit money. The money deposited in this private account amounted to about one hundred billion dinars. At the same time, architect B.P. made several sketches, plans, studies, and designs, and his side income reached 663,000 dinars in addition to his regular salary at the Urban Construction Bureau!

    His colleague, a more famous Zagreb architect, made an even bigger deal this year. On January 3rd, he signed a contract to design a drawing for the Zagreb Fair. He submitted the drawing on February 2nd and received a check for 835,000 dinars. On March 1st, the architect signed a new contract with the Fair's management authority to design a drawing for a large project, with a design fee of 1.6 million dinars. Then another contract was signed to make a model for the designed project, with a cost of 700,000 dinars. At the same time, another contract was signed to design some small projects for the Fair, with a design fee of 430,000 dinars. Therefore, this famous architect received 3,565,000 dinars from the Fair alone, but the architect we are talking about is a long-term staff member of the design bureau. During this period, in addition to receiving his salary from his organization, he also had 63 hours of overtime pay.

    During our small-scale investigation, we found similar situations in Belgrade, Sarajevo, and Skopje, and even in small cities. For example, a chief engineer of a construction company in Dubrovnik designed a special cement ditch for building houses. Due to his invention, the engineer received a bonus from his own company, and later, he hired people to engage in private production, producing this product, and earned three million dinars in a few months.

    The Zagreb company Katran has its own lawyer, but it also hired a lawyer who is the cousin of the company's business director. This lawyer's monthly salary is nearly 150,000 to 200,000 dinars.

    In the art world, absurd phenomena are even more numerous. There are situations where people with little fame receive much more income than their famous counterparts. One of the leaders of the Zagreb theater world, V.B., had an income of 265,000 dinars last year, while painters M.V. and I.Z. each earned about 1.8 million dinars from the writers' agency just from designing posters and billboards. A conductor at the Zagreb Conservatory of Music received 80,000 dinars in special income from the Conservatory last year, and a cellist at the Conservatory received 265,000 dinars in remuneration. Last year, two photojournalists earned 2.5 million dinars, while a famous Yugoslav painter earned 165,000 dinars from selling two oil paintings last year. Many famous writers in Zagreb and Belgrade have low incomes and live on royalties, but a writer, producer, and actor at the Zagreb Comedy Theater earned an additional 267,204 dinars in the first half of this year in addition to his regular salary. In addition to these anomalies and new ways to make easy money, we also encountered some typical examples, although these examples are rare, they still exist. This is traveling with public money and receiving high allowances and supplies.

    Representatives of the Varteks textile factory in Varaždin received 22.3 times their full monthly salary last year (including various subsidies and supplies). A representative and salesman of this enterprise, I.G., was in a much better situation. In addition to his twelve months of regular salary, he received nineteen months of salary in the form of various supplies and allowances. One of his colleagues received a total of fifty-five months of salary (about once a week), and another patrol salesman from the Krapina factory even received sixty-eight monthly salaries, that is, once every five days.

    The manager and chief engineer of a company in Zagreb traveled to distant Ethiopia last year. When the two set off, the order they received was that the trip should last no more than thirty days. But the manager returned after forty-six days, and he issued a travel expense list, and the company gave him 754,411 dinars. The chief engineer went for a full twelve months before returning, and the company spent 816,756 dinars on his travel expenses.

    After the recent measures were taken to limit high bonuses in enterprises, the matter of paying large amounts of bonuses has decreased and returned to normal. But in our investigation, we found a new example from the publishing bureau of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts: the director of the bureau received a bonus of 317,790 dinars, the chief accountant received 257,000 dinars, the secretary received 206,000 dinars, and the director of the import department received 129,000 dinars. The payment of these funds was approved by the bureau's workers' council.

    The few examples we encountered in our investigation tell us that some people, either through their actions or due to the environment in which we live, cleverly exploit the shortcomings of certain experts. In the competition for large amounts of remuneration and bonuses, some people forget their reputation, that is, regardless of the reputation of their profession and the quality of their work, and in the examples we have encountered, some people have exceeded the limits allowed by law. All of this is for the god of wealth.

    在南斯拉夫的生财之道
    本报讯　贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫“消息报”不久以前发表了一篇题为“生财之道”的文章。从这篇文章里，人们可以了解南斯拉夫的社会生活是什么样的。文章全文如下：
    一个画家有一个学龄前的儿子。一家酿酒工厂的营业部主任打电话给这个艺术家，要求他赶快为这家工厂的一种新产品画一个招牌，当时这个孩子正用一支铅笔在纸上划曲线，而这些曲线的意思他自己也不知道。第二天，这个画家叫他的儿子用一支黑粉笔划曲线，然后在某些部分涂上黄黑的颜色，就在同一天的下午他把这幅画作为新产品的招牌交给了这家工厂的营业部主任。几天之后，这个招牌就被印了几百万份，而这个画家从这家酿酒工厂得到了二十五万第纳尔，作为他的儿子的这幅画的报酬。
    在贝尔格莱德，某一位建筑师安排了一个小型展览会，一天就得了九万九千第纳尔；在萨格勒布，一家小制片厂的经理请假不拿工资，然后跟他自己的企业签订一项制片合同，在两个星期之内，他赚了二十万第纳尔；在卢布尔雅那，一个经济学家同时给几家斯洛文尼亚工厂担任名誉顾问，除了他的正薪以外，他每月从每一家工厂得到大约五万五千第纳尔……
    这种现象促使我们进行一种小规模的调查工作来设法断定至少在某些情况下，某些人赚多少钱，以及他们是用什么方法赚钱的。我们必须承认，我们的尝试发现了比我们原来预料的多得多的情况。我们发现，个人主义者，艺术家和假艺术家有许多方法赚容易钱，而且有些人一夜之间就可以比他们这一行的能手赚多得多的钱。我们也相信，要赚这种钱，人们不需要有名，也不需要有才能。只要聪明就够了。
    萨格勒布建筑师B．U．跟他的老同事比起来，在建筑这一行中并不是那么有名的。但是，在业务中，以及从赚的钱来说，他超过了建筑界许多最有名的人。在他这一行业中，他是内部建筑问题的一个专家，而且有些名气，但是比较了解他的人们都说，B ．U．不过是一个把他的业务组织得很好，并且会赚大钱的聪明的青年人。在每一次萨格勒布博览会上，每当安排展览馆和展览台的时候，他一赚就是几百万，萨格勒布的艺术建筑业务绝大多数都是他的那一家没有登记的小企业做的。有十个建筑系的学生和同样多的艺术系的学生、雕刻师、泥瓦工和木工为他工作。建筑师
  B．U．从事改造萨格勒布十家大厦的工作，每改造一所大厦就是三百万、五百万、一千万，甚至更多的第纳尔。在萨格勒布商业界，这位年青的建筑师的名气非常大，以至于（谁也不知道为什么）萨格勒布商会建议让他负责改造共和国大厦和市中心区主要部分的其他大厦。
    这位年青的建筑师自己有游艇、汽车，过着非常阔绰的生活，他那一行的人们说，B．U．做商人要比做建筑师好得多，在萨格勒布大学，他的静力学没有及格，因此他转到卢布尔雅那大学，甚至到今天，他还在参加卢布尔雅那大学的考试。知道他的人都说，
  B．U．建筑师不太懂设计，是别人替他设计的，他只管经营和收钱。
    在萨格勒布，还有几个做了大生意的青年建筑师，他们在萨格勒布和克罗地亚经营许多企业。这些企业事实上是组织得很好的小型企业。这些企业雇用职员工作，而他们的年青而聪明的老板则大赚其钱。
    在我们的调查工作中，我们进一步强调指出，在这些行业中，有时也有一些有身份的、有些名望的设计师。萨格勒布城市建设局前局长、建筑师B．P．在他自己的局里组织了他自己的小企业。那就是说，他签订私人合同，给十个小城市作市政建设计划，并且，他从他自己的局里雇佣人员来做这件事情。首脑仅仅组织和监督业务的进行，而其它的人则做设计和计划工作。当业务开始发展的时候，这位城市建设局局长就在萨格勒布国家银行开了他自己的户头存钱。在这个私人户头中存的钱约达一千亿第纳尔。同时，建筑师B．P．做了好几个草图、计划、研究和设计，除了他在城市建设局的正薪以外，他的业余收入达六十六万三千第纳尔之多！
    他的同事，一个更著名的萨格勒布建筑师，今年做了一件更大的买卖。在1月3日，他签了一个合同，给萨格勒布博览会设计一个图样，在2月2日就交了图样，并且得到一张八十三万五千第纳尔的支票。在3月1日，这位建筑师跟博览会的管理当局签订了一个新合同，要设计一个大工程的图样，设计费是一百六十万第纳尔。接着又签订了一个合同，给这个设计的工程做一个模型，费用是七十万第纳尔。同时还签订了另外一个合同，给博览会设计一些小的工程，设计费是四十三万第纳尔。因此这位著名的建筑师单是从博览会就得到了三百五十六万五千第纳尔，但是我们所谈到的这个建筑师是设计局的一个长期工作人员。在这个期间，他除了从他的机关领工资外还额外有六十三小时的加班费。
    在我们所进行的这个小规模调查期间，我们发现在贝尔格莱德、萨拉热窝和斯科普里，甚至在小城市都有类似的情况。例如，杜布罗夫尼克一个建筑业的总工程师设计了建筑房屋使用的特别水泥沟渠。由于他的这一发明，这个工程师从他自己的企业获得了一笔奖金，而后来，他又雇佣了人员来从事私人生产，生产这一产品，在几个月之内就赚了三百万第纳尔。
    萨格勒布的企业卡特兰公司有它自己的律师，但是，它又雇了一个律师，这个律师是这个企业的营业部主任的表兄。这个律师每月薪金将近十五万到二十万第纳尔。
    在艺术界，荒谬现象甚至更多。有这种情况：没有什么名气的人所得到的收入比他们著名的同行们要多许多倍。萨格勒布戏剧界的领导人之一V．B．去年的收入是二十六万五千第纳尔，而画家M．V．和I．Z．每人只是从设计招贴画、广告牌就从作家代理机构获得约一百八十万第纳尔。萨格勒布音乐院的一个指挥去年在该院得到了八万第纳尔的特别收入，该院的一个大提琴师得到了二十六万五千第纳尔的报酬。去年两个摄影记者的收入达二百五十万第纳尔，而一个著名的南斯拉夫画家去年卖了两幅油画得到了十六万五千第纳尔。萨格勒布和贝尔格莱德的许多著名的作家收入不多，靠版税过日子，但是萨格勒布杂剧院的一个作家、制片人和演员今年上半年除了他的正薪以外，还获得了二十六万七千二百零四第纳尔的额外报酬。除了这些反常现象和赚钱容易的新方法以外，我们也碰到了一些典型的例子，固然这些例子是少见的，但是它们还是存在。这就是拿公家的钱旅行，以及获得很高的津贴和供给。
    瓦腊日丁的瓦尔捷克斯纺织工厂的代表们去年都拿了二十二点三次全月薪水（包括各种补助费和供给）。这个企业的一个代表、推销员I．G．境况更好得多，除了他的十二个月的正薪以外，他得到了以各种供给和津贴的形式给予的十九个月的薪水，他的一个同行总共得到了五十五个月的薪水（大约每周一次），另一个克腊皮纳工厂的巡逻推销员甚至得到了六十八次月薪，也就是说，每五天一次。
    萨格勒布一家企业的经理和总工程师去年到遥远的埃塞俄比亚去旅行。两个人出发的时候所接到的命令是，旅行至多只能有三十天。但是经理在过了四十六天以后才回来，他开了一张旅费清单，企业给了他七十五万四千四百一十一第纳尔。总工程师整整去了十二个月才回来，企业为他花了八十一万六千七百五十六第纳尔的旅行费。
    在最近采取了限制企业中的高额奖金的措施以后，大量付给奖金的事情减少了，恢复了正常状态。但是在我们的调查中，我们发现了南斯拉夫科学艺术院出版局的一个新的例子：该局的局长得到了三十一万七千七百九十第纳尔的奖金，总会计师得到了二十五万七千第纳尔，秘书得到了二十万六千第纳尔，进口部主任得到了十二万九千第纳尔。付这些钱是该局的工人委员会批准的。
    在我们的调查工作中所碰到的少数几个例子告诉我们：有些人或者以他们的行动，或者由于我们所生活的环境，巧妙地利用了某些专家的缺点。在获取大量报酬和奖金的竞争中，有些人忘记了自己的名誉，即不顾自己职业的名誉和工作的好坏，而在我们所碰到的这些例子中，有些人超过了法律所容许的范围。所有这一切都是为了财神爷。
