    Establishing Fertilizer Bases with Long-Term Planning
    Zeng Zhi
    Farmland requires basic construction, and so does fertilizer; we must establish fertilizer bases. The reasoning is simple. First, although natural fertilizer sources are abundant, “collecting while they regenerate, never ending,” it still requires many people to find them, and the problem of finding fertilizer sources arises every year. Second, some types of natural fertilizer, such as river mud, kang (platform bed) ash, and wall scrapings, may gradually decrease year after year due to continuous and large-scale excavation and accumulation. Third, natural fertilizers are mostly soil-based or mixed fertilizers with low effectiveness, requiring a large application quantity. A mu (0.16 acres) of land generally needs several hundred or even one or two thousand dan (1 dan = 50 kg), requiring a large amount of labor just for transporting and applying fertilizer, which is very uneconomical. To solve these problems, we need to establish fertilizer bases.
    Establishing fertilizer bases means raising pigs and sheep in large numbers to accumulate manure, planting green manure crops, and establishing large-scale fertilizer plants, etc., to establish fertilizer sources on a reliable foundation. Pig and sheep manure, commonly referred to as stable manure, has a relatively high fertilizer efficiency. Historical facts have proven that regions with more pigs and sheep, and more application of pig and sheep manure, generally experience larger increases in agricultural production. Now, after the people's communes have been established, the conditions for raising pigs and sheep to accumulate manure are much better than in the past, and collective animal husbandry can be greatly developed. Establishing livestock farms can not only accumulate fertilizer and promote agricultural production but also meet the people's need for meat and increase commune income. While promoting collective feeding, commune members can also be encouraged to raise a small number of pigs, chickens, and other livestock and poultry privately, and the accumulated manure can be purchased by the commune at a fair price according to its quality. In the future, communes should preferably raise livestock such as pigs and sheep in a planned manner according to the fertilizer needs of farmland, gradually achieving pig-raising according to the land area, with each mu of land having a certain number of pigs and sheep to supply fertilizer.
    Planting green manure crops is an important way to develop fertilizer sources. Green manure is very rich in organic matter and has high levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Planting green manure not only increases crop yields but also improves the soil and plays a significant role in the development of animal husbandry. Since green manure is planted and turned into the soil on the spot, it can greatly save labor for transporting and applying fertilizer. Therefore, from all perspectives, we need to greatly develop green manure. This year, it is even more necessary to strengthen field management, overcome extensive farming methods, and increase the yield per unit area as much as possible. To strengthen the field management of green manure, one is to pay attention to preventing frost damage, ensuring that green manure overwinters safely and grows healthily; the other is to "use a small amount of fertilizer to nourish a large amount of fertilizer," applying fertilizer to green manure fields and changing the past habit of not fertilizing.
    Establishing large-scale fertilizer plants has particularly significant implications for improving fertilizer quality and ensuring increased production. In May last year, 10% of the third-class seedlings in Yuhang County, Zhejiang (now merged into Lin'an County), needed topdressing with quick-acting fertilizer to revive and upgrade. At that time, human manure, pigsty manure, and sheep manure were all used up. What to do? The county party committee led the people of the entire county to start from scratch, establish large-scale fertilizer plants, and vigorously develop indigenous chemical fertilizers. More than 4,600 indigenous chemical fertilizer plants and 50 advanced chemical fertilizer plants were established. By the beginning of November last year, more than 3.7 million dan of indigenous chemical fertilizer had been produced. Using these indigenous chemical fertilizers, the people of Yuhang County eliminated second-class and third-class seedlings, increasing the yield of early rice by two to three times compared to 1957, and the total grain output for the whole year also increased several times. This fact clearly illustrates the role played by indigenous chemical fertilizers. People's communes in various regions should establish their own fertilizer factories in accordance with the principle of "local materials, local manufacturing, focusing on indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods" to meet the growing need for fertilizer in the great leap in agriculture.

    从长打算，建立肥料基地
    曾志
    农田要进行基本建设，肥料也要进行基本建设，要建立肥料基地。这个道理很简单。因为第一、自然肥源虽然很丰富，“边积边又生，永远完不了”，但是，毕竟需要很多人去找，年年要发生找肥源的问题。第二、自然肥料中有一些种类，如河泥、炕洞土、屋墙等等，由于连年大量挖掘、积集，也可能一年比一年减少。第三、自然肥料多是土肥、杂肥，肥效不高，需要施肥的数量就大，一亩田一般都需要施用几百担甚至一、二千担，仅仅是运肥、施肥就需要大量的劳动力，这是很不经济的。要解决这几个问题，就需要建立肥料基地。
    所谓建立肥料基地，就是要大量养猪养羊积肥、种植绿肥、大办肥料厂等，把肥源建立在可靠的基础上。猪、羊粪，就是通常所说的厩肥，肥效较高。根据历年来的事实证明，多养猪、羊，多施猪、羊粪的地区，农业增产的幅度一般都比较大。现在，人民公社化以后，养猪养羊积肥的条件比过去好得多了，可以大大发展集体饲养业。建立畜牧场，一方面可以积攒肥料，促进农业增产；一方面可以满足人民对肉食的需要，增加公社收入。在集体喂养的同时，还可以鼓励社员自养少量的猪、鸡等家畜家禽，所积的肥由公社按质按价收购。公社今后最好能够按照农田需肥数量，有计划地饲养猪羊等家畜，逐步做到按田养猪，每亩田都有一定数量的猪羊供给肥料。
    种植绿肥，是开拓肥源的一个重要途径。绿肥的有机质含量非常丰富，氮、磷、钾养分很高。种植绿肥不但可以提高农作物产量，而且可以改良土壤，对畜牧业的发展也有重大作用。由于绿肥是就地种植就地翻压肥田，又可以大大节省运肥、施肥的劳力。因此，无论从那方面来看，都需要大大发展绿肥。今年，就更需要加强田间管理，克服粗放的耕作方法，尽可能提高单位面积的产量。加强绿肥的田间管理，一是要注意防止冻害，使绿肥安全越冬、健康生长；一是要“以小肥养大肥”，对绿肥田进行施肥，改变过去不施肥的习惯。
    大办肥料厂对于提高肥料质量、保证增产，有特别重大的意义。浙江余杭县（现并为临安县）去年5月，有10％的三类苗需要追施速效肥料，才能返青升级。当时人粪、猪圈肥、羊粪都用光了，怎么办？县委领导着全县人民白手起家，大办肥料厂，大搞土化肥，一举办起了土化肥厂四千六百多个、高级化肥厂五十个。到去年11月上旬止，已生产了三百七十多万担土化肥。就用这些土化肥，余杭县的人们消灭了二类苗、三类苗，使早稻产量比1957年翻了两三番，全年粮食产量也成倍增长。这个事实很清楚地说明了土化肥所起的作用。各地人民公社应该根据“就地取材，就地制造，以土为主，土洋结合”的方针建立自己的肥料工厂，满足农业大跃进对肥料日益增长的需要。
