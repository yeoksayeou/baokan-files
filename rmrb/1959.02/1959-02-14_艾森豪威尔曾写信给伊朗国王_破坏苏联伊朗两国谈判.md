Xinhua News Agency, February 13th, New York dispatch: According to a report in the "New York Times" on the 12th, while a Soviet delegation was in Tehran last week holding negotiations with the Iranian government on a treaty of friendship and non-aggression, U.S. President Eisenhower wrote a letter to the Iranian King, blatantly interfering with and sabotaging the negotiations between the two countries.

In his letter, Eisenhower told the Iranian King to be "wary" of the so-called Soviet "gestures" and to "firmly" stand with the West and its allies in the "Baghdad" Pact.

As is well known, the United States and Iran have been conspiring to conclude a bilateral military agreement directed against the Middle East and socialist countries.

Recently, a delegation composed of McGee, a member of Eisenhower's special committee for studying U.S. foreign military and economic "aid," and Admiral Radford has also been actively engaged in Tehran and has held talks with the Iranian King and government.

    艾森豪威尔曾写信给伊朗国王
    破坏苏联伊朗两国谈判
    新华社13日讯　纽约消息：据“纽约时报”12日报道，在苏联代表团上周在德黑兰同伊朗政府举行缔结友好和互不侵犯条约的谈判期间，美国总统艾森豪威尔曾写信给伊朗国王，露骨地干涉和破坏两国的谈判。
    艾森豪威尔在他的信中要伊朗国王“小心提防”所谓苏联的“姿态”，“坚定地”跟西方和“巴格达”条约的盟国站在一起。
    如所周知，美国同伊朗一直在阴谋缔结一项矛头指向中近东和社会主义国家的双边性军事协定。
    最近由艾森豪威尔的研究美国对外军事和经济“援助”特别委员会委员麦吉和海军上将雷德福组成的一个代表团也在德黑兰进行了频繁活动，并且同伊朗国王和政府举行了会谈。
