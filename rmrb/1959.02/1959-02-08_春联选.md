Spring Couplet Selections

With soaring enthusiasm, build the motherland; red flags like paintings dance in the east wind.

Boundless happiness, sing aloud for the people's commune; a bright future, determined to be a new person of communism.

Red flags flutter, the motherland's construction advances rapidly; long live peace, the people of the world are of one heart.
