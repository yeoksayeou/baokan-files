Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd, San Francisco dispatch: The U.S. Federal District Court in San Francisco began re-examining the so-called “Powell Case” on January 26th, holding hearings for several consecutive days. The plaintiff in this "case" is the U.S. government, which, angered by the exposure and condemnation by former "China Weekly Review" editor J.B. Powell and his wife, along with assistant editor Julian Schuman, of U.S. germ warfare in Korea and China and the disruption of Korean armistice negotiations, is attempting to pin some baseless charges on them.

This trial is being conducted while Powell and others are being deprived of their right to a fair trial. The U.S. government is refusing to disclose government secret documents requested by the defendants, which could expose the truth of the case. At the same time, it refuses to sign a judicial assistance agreement with China, making it impossible for the trial to obtain the necessary objective and impartial evidence and witness testimony.

Powell's lawyer, Garry, pointed out on January 27th during his defense of Powell that the U.S. government conducted germ warfare during the Korean War. He stated that if he were allowed to invite witnesses from China, he would definitely be able to provide evidence. Garry also pointed out, based on facts, that the U.S. government had prepared for germ warfare as early as World War II. Shortly before the end of the war, the U.S. government had "a ship of bacterial materials prepared to be transported to Japan or the Mariana Islands," "ready to spread bacteria on rice fields."

Powell's other defense lawyer, Mrs. Walker, righteously stated, "The defendants had every reason to believe what they published. They believed their sources were reliable."

The U.S. government's situation is completely passive. Throughout the five days of the trial, it has been unable to produce any human or material evidence to prove that it did not conduct germ warfare.

Due to the undeniable facts, the U.S. government had to admit before the trial began that it did indeed "have the capability to launch chemical and germ warfare" during the Korean War. However, in order to wash away its monstrous crimes committed during the Korean War, the U.S. government stated that it never used bacteriological weapons or transported them abroad. But this statement by the U.S. government is obviously a clumsy attempt to cover up the truth, because if the U.S. government really did not launch germ warfare, then why doesn't it dare to disclose the government secret documents that Powell requested, and why doesn't it dare to sign a judicial assistance agreement with China to allow the defendants to present a large amount of material and human evidence regarding the U.S. conducting germ warfare?

The U.S. government is also speechless on the issue of disrupting the Korean armistice negotiations, which Powell had exposed. In order to avoid further exposing its true colors on this issue, the U.S. government has had to withdraw such a "charge" against Powell and others in its indictment: that the so-called reporting by Powell and others on the U.S. government disrupting the Korean armistice negotiations was "deliberate lying."

But despite this, the U.S. government has not given up its intention to murder Powell and others.

The U.S. government originally framed Powell and others with the charge of so-called "sedition." Since this "charge" could not stand, the U.S. government on the 29th falsely accused Powell and others of so-called "treason."

The U.S. government then formally charged Powell and others on the 30th with "treason" instead of "sedition." According to U.S. prosecutor Schnacke, who defended the U.S. government, "treason" is a "much more serious charge than 'sedition,' and the most severe penalty can be the death penalty." At this point, the U.S. government's conspiracy to murder Powell and others is completely exposed.

Powell and others are currently out on bail. U.S. Attorney Karelish announced that he will re-process the "Powell Case" on February 12th on the charge of "treason."

    阴谋杀害鲍惠尔夫妇
    美政府又制造莫须有罪名
    新华社2日讯　旧金山消息：美国旧金山联邦地方法院从1月26日开始连日开庭重新审理所谓“鲍惠尔案”。这个“案件”的原告是美国政府，它因为前上海“密勒氏评论报”主笔鲍惠尔夫妇和助理编辑舒曼曾经揭露和谴责美国在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战以及破坏朝鲜停战谈判而恼羞成怒，因而企图把一些莫须有的罪名加在他们身上。
    这个审讯是在鲍惠尔等人被剥夺公正审讯权利的情况下进行的。美国政府一方面拒绝公开被告要求公开的可以暴露案件真相的政府秘密文件，另一方面又拒绝同中国签订司法协助协议，使审讯无法获得必需的客观公正的证物和证人的证词。
    鲍惠尔的律师加里27日在为鲍惠尔辩护时指出美国政府在朝鲜战争期间进行了细菌战。他表示，如果允许他从中国请来证人，他就一定能够提供证据。加里还根据事实指出，美国政府早在第二次世界大战期间就准备进行细菌战，在大战结束前不久，美国政府曾经“有一船细菌物资准备运往日本或马里亚纳群岛”，“准备在稻田上散布细菌”。
    鲍惠尔的另一个辩护律师沃克夫人义正辞严地指出，“被告有一切理由相信他们出版的东西。他们认为他们的消息来源是可靠的。”
    美国政府的处境完全被动，在整整五天的审讯中，它提不出任何可以证实它没有进行细菌战的人证和物证。
    由于事实俱在，美国政府在开审前不得不承认，它在朝鲜战争中确是“具有发动化学和细菌战的能力”。可是为了洗刷它在朝鲜战争中所犯的滔天罪行，美国政府又说，它从没有使用过细菌武器和把细菌武器运到国外。但是美国政府这个说法显然欲盖弥彰，因为如果美国政府真的没有发动细菌战，那么它又为什么不敢公开鲍惠尔要求公开的政府秘密文件，为什么它不敢同中国签订司法协助协议，让被告提出关于美国进行细菌战的大量物证和人证？
    美国政府在鲍惠尔曾经揭露过的关于破坏朝鲜停战谈判的问题上也理屈词穷。为了避免在这个问题上进一步暴露自己的面目，美国政府已不得不撤销它在起诉时加给鲍惠尔等人的这样一个“罪状”：就是所谓鲍惠尔等人报道美国政府破坏朝鲜停战谈判是“故意撒谎”。
    但是尽管如此，美国政府并没有放弃杀害鲍惠尔等人的念头。
    美国政府原来诬加在鲍惠尔等人身上的罪名是所谓“煽动叛乱罪”。由于这个“罪名”无法成立，美国政府29日又诬指鲍惠尔等人犯有所谓“叛国行为”。
    美国政府接着在30日正式控告鲍惠尔等人犯有“叛国罪”而不是“煽动叛乱罪”。据为美国政府辩护的美国检察官施纳克的解释，“叛国罪”是比“煽动叛乱罪”“严重得多的罪名，最重的刑罚可以判处死刑。”至此美国政府想杀害鲍惠尔等人的阴谋就完全暴露。
    鲍惠尔等人现在正交保保释中。美国检察官卡雷希宣布，他将在2月12日以“叛国罪”的罪名重新处理“鲍惠尔案”。（附图片）
