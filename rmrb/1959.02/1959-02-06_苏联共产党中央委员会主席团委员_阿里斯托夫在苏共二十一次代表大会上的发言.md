Xinhua News Agency, February 4th: According to the Soviet "Pravda" report: The speech by Aristov, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU, at the morning session of the 21st Congress of the CPSU on January 31, is as follows:

    Comrades! Our party, all the Soviet people, and our foreign friends are paying great attention to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Comrade Khrushchev's report "On the Control Figures for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union for 1959-1965" has received enthusiastic responses in every corner of the Soviet Union and in countries around the world.

    This historically significant document points out the remarkable achievements we have made in convening this congress, reveals more colorful prospects, puts forward the tasks of the new era, and profoundly and comprehensively demonstrates the party's great program for communist construction. The vitality and realism of this program lie in the fact that it was formulated with the participation of the whole people, relying on the rich experience accumulated by the party over the years in the glorious struggle to build a new society.

    The particularly valuable thing about the report is that it reasonably, simply, and clearly, with Bolshevik enthusiasm, uses the power of facts and irrefutable calculations, and with clear optimism, convinces us that our country will definitely build communism in the not-too-distant future.

    Communists are often called dreamers. That is indeed the case. V.I. Lenin himself loved to dream about the future of our motherland. He said, "One should dream." Our enemies used to laugh at this, wanting to see Russia as a dark, poor, and backward country. Even now, perhaps some people, when recalling the words of H.G. Wells and talking about Comrade Khrushchev's report, will call the reporter and us communists, the participants in the congress, new dreamers of the Kremlin. But we can say that our great plan is not made for foreign skeptics and malicious people, but for our people. Our people are realizing their mysterious ideals for a bright future, and they are building a new society. (Applause)

    Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev's report on substantiating the control figures for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union for the next seven years also shines like a searchlight, illuminating the distance, where the outlines of the magnificent edifice of communism are already faintly visible. The report raises a series of new questions on specifically applying Marxist-Leninist theory in combination with our country's actual conditions. The report sets an example of creatively developing the immortal ideas of Marxism-Leninism, and makes the important conclusion that socialism has not only achieved a complete victory in our country, but also a thorough victory.

    It seems that even foreign bourgeois politicians have to consider this. The Seven-Year Plan has shocked the entire capitalist world, causing capitalists to feel extremely fearful of the growth of socialist forces. Among them, some threaten with war, while others are looking for friendship with us, which is not accidental. Most of them still advocate ending the "Cold War" and developing extensive economic and cultural ties between the East and the West.

   **The October Revolution Planted a Huge Driving Force in the Socialist System**
   **The Growth Rate of Soviet Industry Far Exceeds that of Capitalist Countries**

    Comrades! In Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev's report, great importance is attached to the prospects of peaceful economic competition between the Soviet Union and the major capitalist country, the United States, and it is pointed out how decisive a role the growth rate of industrial production will play in this competition. I would like to talk about this issue in more detail.

    As everyone knows, the average annual growth rate of our industry since the establishment of the Soviet regime has been two to four times higher than that of industrially developed capitalist countries. This shows how great a driving force the October Revolution has planted in the socialist system, and what a great force it has aroused in our people that can create miracles.

    Our country opened up its new economic path from unforgettable years, when, as a result of the First World War and the subsequent civil war, we faced hunger and destruction caused by the remnants of counter-revolutionary forces and the encirclement of imperialist countries. In 1920, we produced only one-fifth of the industrial products of Tsarist Russia in 1913. We did not recover to the pre-revolutionary level of production until the end of 1926. During this period, the United States had already exceeded the 1913 level by 50%.

    In 1925, our party, at the Fourteenth Congress, carried out Lenin's will and adopted a firm policy of national industrialization. Following this policy, the Soviet Union achieved a huge leap forward in the initial five-year plan periods, making industrial production in 1940 seven and a half times higher than in 1913. The industrial output value of the United States increased by less than one time during the same period. It can be seen that our pre-war development speed was already three times higher than that of the United States.

    In 1941, a new and more cruel war came upon our motherland, hindering our continued peaceful socialist construction. This caused us to lag behind in industry for many years. It was only in 1948 that we exceeded the pre-war level, but at this time, the industry in the United States had increased by 50% compared to 1940. This is completely understandable, because the American economy was not tested by the war, American factories were not bombed by the enemy, and the supply of munitions brought huge profits to the capitalists.

    But not long after, in 1950, our industrial output value increased by about fourteen times compared to 1913, while the United States only increased by 2.2 times. In this way, even including the war period, our growth rate of industrial output value was not lower than before, but higher than before.

    In the following years, the distance between the industrial development speed of the Soviet Union and the United States became larger and larger, and our country went further and further ahead. In 1955, the industrial output value of the Soviet Union increased by twenty-six times compared to the level of 1913, while the United States increased by less than three times.

    In 1958, the total industrial output value of the Soviet Union, as pointed out in Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev's report, increased by thirty-five times compared to the level of 1913, while the industrial output value of the United States only increased by less than three times. It can be seen that on the eve of the Seven-Year Plan, compared with the level of 1913, our growth rate was eight and a half times faster than that of the United States. The calculations of the Seven-Year Plan show that compared with 1913, by the end of 1965, our growth rate will be about twelve times faster than that of the United States. Comrades, you can all see that this is the reason why American monopoly capitalists are panicking! These materials clearly show how the great power of our socialist system is constantly growing year by year, and how its superiority over the capitalist system is manifested more profoundly and extensively. In this way, some bourgeois economists who serve monopoly capital say that our development speed seems to be slowing down, but it's just nonsense! Bourgeois ideologists attempt to use this deceptive propaganda to conceal the undeniable superiority of socialism over capitalism from the working people of their own countries, and to belittle and distort the great significance of the achievements of our communist construction in the minds of ordinary people. But as the saying goes, lies don't go far, and they can't hide or escape in front of the truth. The truth of facts and figures is the most eloquent.

   **The Party's Correct Policy Guarantees the High-Speed Development of the Soviet Economy**
   **The Soviet People Can Accomplish Any Task Put Forward by the Motherland**

    What exactly guarantees the high-speed development of the Soviet economy? First of all, it is our socialist system, the party's correct Leninist policy, which requires giving priority to the development of heavy industry as the main foundation for improving the entire national economy, strengthening national defense, and improving the material welfare of the working people. Factors such as the constantly rising political and labor enthusiasm of the whole people and our possession of many skilled cadres and endless natural resources also guarantee our high-speed development.

    We are richer than any country in the world. I am not only referring to the abundance of mineral deposits, but also to our vast fertile agricultural land. With further research into our country's underground treasures, we are constantly discovering new, almost mythical wealth, especially in Siberia and the Far East. It can be said without error that these regions will be the main warehouse and the most important source for the development of material social production for many centuries. Our possession of natural resources is an important condition for our independence from the capitalist world.

    As everyone knows, the United States has the most superior conditions compared with other capitalist countries in terms of the reserves of natural minerals. But its resources cannot be compared with the natural resources of our motherland at all. If we take the world reserves of the sixteen most important minerals that have been identified, the Soviet Union ranks first in the world in thirteen types. Our task is to use these natural resources on an ever-increasing scale, with a sense of ownership, and in the most effective way.

    V.I. Lenin pointed out that our eastern regions have abundant mineral reserves, which must be used to serve the Soviet economy. In his article "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government," he wrote: "The exploitation of these natural resources by means of the latest technology would provide the basis for an unprecedented development of the productive forces." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian version, Vol. 27, p. 228, Chinese version, p. 235)

    Now, the time has come for us to take huge measures to utilize the wealth of our eastern regions. Investment in this area in the next seven years accounts for more than 40% of total investment. In this way, Lenin's ideal of developing the rich natural resources of Siberia and the Far East is being realized.

    However, our most important superiority lies in the fact that we are Soviet people, in our cadres, whom Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev spoke about with such ardent and enthusiastic feelings in his report. These are skilled workers, agricultural experts, specialists, scientists, economic workers, and party workers. These people are educated by the party in the spirit of unlimited loyalty to the cause of communism, they have deep and profound knowledge, creative spirit, and the will to achieve victory, and they have the ability to solve any tasks that the motherland puts forward to them.

    Our era is an era of new inventions in many scientific and technological fields. Now the solution of some new and huge tasks does not depend on individual persons, nor on individual talented scientists and inventors, although they still, as before, should enjoy lofty honor and respect, and their names add brilliance to mankind. Here in the Soviet Union, these people are especially cherished. However, now some major scientific and technological problems can only be solved by relying on the entire collective, or even many collectives, and some problems can only be solved by the efforts of the entire people nationwide. Our outstanding scientists, engineers, and workers, who were cultivated by the Communist Party, have completed extremely great feats by manufacturing and launching the world's first artificial Earth satellites and space rockets. These great achievements are the achievements of our entire people and the achievements of our socialist social system. (Prolonged applause)

    The launch of the Soviet space rocket has opened up the path for the study of interplanetary space. We must continue to move forward on this path. Only our socialist system can further explore the mysteries of nature and study the vast universe. Let those respectable capitalists try to catch up with us! This is also a good form of competition.

**The Strength of the Soviet Union Expands and Grows Year by Year and Will Surely Win in the Economic Competition with the United States**

    Comrades! We Soviet people love our motherland. Russians have always loved their homeland and added glory to it. Therefore, our history is full of many heroic deeds. We are proud of this. But now, when we see new cities and new industrial enterprises emerging day by day in the vast land of our country, when our collective farms and state farms are becoming more and more consolidated and prosperous, when the life of the Soviet people is becoming more and more beautiful, when our motherland, like Gogol imagined, is like a Russian troika, galloping forward towards the sun, towards communism, forcing the capitalist countries to "retreat three houses," our country is even more beautiful and more cherished by all of us. (Stormy applause) We firmly believe that people like our heroic Soviet people will surely win in the competition with capitalism, and victory will be ours! But in order to accelerate the arrival of this victory, we must have a good understanding and study of the imperialist system and the strong and weak sides of our main opponent—the United States. We soberly take into account that the United States is a highly developed industrial country, and the United States has made great achievements in the development of science and technology. In the historic competition with the United States, we cannot be like a reckless rider who does not estimate the ability of his mount, and may catch up with his enemy in one lap, but when approaching the end, he gasps for breath and cannot withstand the test. This is what our enemies hope for. But they will not get what they want. Our strength is expanding and growing year by year on an increasingly larger scale. Yesterday, "Pravda" published a dispatch from the United States, which said that "The New York Times" published an article entitled "The Slow Growth of the American Economy Gives Reason to Predict That the Soviet Union Can Win the Competition." The author of the article compared this speed to the "tortoise and the hare race," and he admitted that the United States is the speed of the tortoise. Indeed, we want to overtake the United States, we want to overtake the United States like overtaking a tortoise, but only on our own industrial horse, and overtake the United States at the wrong station that Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev talked about. The Soviet Union will catch up with and then surpass the United States in the total output of major industrial and agricultural products and the output per capita by 1970. By then, we will have the highest standard of living and a higher technical level than any capitalist country. We will create all the conditions for the comprehensive and coordinated development of people. By that time, the question of which social system is more perfect will finally disappear among the working people of the world. The great Lenin said as early as 1920: "I believe that the Soviet regime will definitely catch up with and surpass the capitalists, and we will not only win the advantage in purely economic terms." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian version, Vol. 31, p. 427, Chinese version, p. 417) Comrades, we are all happy people, because we live in an era when we will be able to see the most desirable Leninist ideals become a reality.

   **The Party Implements Bold Revolutionary Changes to Outdated Management Forms**
   **The Reorganization of the Management of Industry and Construction Has Had Good Results**

    Comrades! In contrast to the great achievements made by our people, how small and pitiful do Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov appear, who tried to prevent our country from developing under new conditions and tried to undermine the implementation of the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU.

    The Communist Party and its Central Committee summarized the experience of economic construction and cultural construction, implemented bold revolutionary changes to outdated and stale management forms, and created new and more flexible forms of leadership, which are in line with the incomparably increased tasks that have appeared on our road to communism.

    I would like to cite a few concrete facts to illustrate how correctly the party has solved the problem of reorganizing the management of industry and construction, delegating management power directly to the local level, to economic regions, and establishing the National Economic Council. These steps had been particularly fiercely opposed by the anti-party group.

    With the help of local party organizations, the National Economic Council has done a lot of work in improving the leadership of industry and construction, utilizing existing potential, and adopting new technologies and renovating equipment in various factories, mines, and construction sites in the year and a half since its establishment. These are just some examples of the activities of the National Economic Council of the Russian Federation.

    The Chelyabinsk National Economic Council studied the conditions and formulated practical measures to ensure that the production of pig iron, steel, and steel products in existing factories could be rapidly increased by more than 50% through expanding and renovating existing factories and modernizing these factories. These measures have been discussed and adopted by the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the government, and are now being implemented. The National Economic Council is also working hard to increase the production of steel pipes and develop the electric metallurgical industry.

    Enterprises of the Sverdlovsk National Economic Council have taken major measures to increase the production of sintered ore for blast furnace ironmaking. The content of sintered ore in the furnace charge has increased by 50% in recent years, thus greatly increasing the output of pig iron from existing blast furnaces. The machine manufacturing factories of this National Economic Council mastered the production of about five hundred new machines and instruments in 1956-1958.

    Enterprises of the Leningrad National Economic Council mastered the production of 677 new types of machines and instruments during this period, which met the requirements of modern science and technology.

    In the past year and a half, we have seen that the National Economic Council has well undertaken major practical tasks and is proficiently, quickly, and skillfully solving these tasks.

    The planned tasks of the All-Russian Federation in 1958 have been successfully completed in all sectors of the national economy. The annual plan for industry was completed by 104%. The achievements made in agriculture are also very good: the Russian Federation overfulfilled the plan for selling grain to the state; in addition, it overfulfilled the plans for delivering meat, milk, and sugar beet. Comrades Poliansky and Melarkhikov have already talked about this in detail at this congress. The housing construction plan has also been overfulfilled.

    Not long ago, the Russian Federation Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPSU, together with the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation, discussed in detail the draft of the Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the republic with the participation of a large number of experts. According to objective conditions and suggestions from the local level, we believe that the 1959-1965 plan for the development of the national economy of the Russian Federation is completely achievable and will be completed ahead of schedule. (Prolonged applause)

    The party congresses held in the Russian Federation before the congress and the countless meetings held by workers and collective farmers have shown that the working people of our republic are fully confident in successfully completing the Seven-Year Plan tasks they face.

      **The Development of Productive Forces Should Rely on the Latest Science and Technology**
      **The Machine Manufacturing Industry Is the Main Link in Technological Progress**

    Comrades! In order to win in the economic competition with capitalism, our entire work of developing national productive forces should rely on the latest scientific achievements and discoveries, and on the most perfect technology.

    Our country has all the possibilities to surpass the technical level of Western countries in both industry and agriculture by the end of the Seven-Year Plan. But for this, our scientists, engineers, designers, and production innovators must make great efforts. Therefore, I would like to raise some issues that I think are very important for the development of socialist industry, Soviet science, and technology. These issues are urgently raised by life itself, but are far from being frequently considered in the work of the National Economic Council and scientific design institutions.

    The first is the machine manufacturing industry. In our era of rapid and comprehensive technological progress today, the machine manufacturing industry determines the development of various sectors of the national economy to a decisive extent. The development of the machine manufacturing industry is much faster here than in all other industrial sectors. But we are still unable to meet the needs of the national economy for various machines, equipment, instruments, and materials.

    In the process of realizing the Seven-Year Plan, the need for rolling mills, excavators, heavy machine tools, calendering machines, and other heavy equipment will increase sharply here. Moreover, the factories of the heavy machine manufacturing industry, such as the Ural Machine Factory, the Novosibirsk Heavy Machine Tool and Calendering Machine Factory, etc., are already overburdened. We must tap more potential to increase the production capacity of existing enterprises in the Russian Federation to manufacture heavy equipment.

    Comrades! I am talking about the machine manufacturing industry not only because it is the main link in technological progress, but also because the Russian Federation plays a leading role in the development of the national machine manufacturing industry. For example, the equipment produced by the Ural Machine Factory alone determines to a large extent the technical level and development of a series of industrial sectors. In 1957, more than 75% of the ore and 80% of the oil were mined using the mining equipment and oil extraction equipment manufactured by the Ural Machine Factory. More than 90% of the sintering machines used in the metallurgical industry were manufactured by this factory. The Ural Machine Factory has equipped more than 75% of the blast furnaces in the Soviet Union with the main equipment. Not to mention the great assistance that the Ural Machine Factory has given to our fraternal People's Republic of China, India, and other countries. It can be seen how great the influence of just one Ural Machine Factory is. The production achievements of many important sectors of the national economy depend on the effectiveness and perfection of the machines manufactured by this factory.

    But it must be pointed out that our machine manufacturing factories often produce machines that are far from perfect and inferior to foreign products.

   **In Order to Make the Technical Level of Machine Manufacturing Surpass Foreign Countries in a Short Period of Time, the Work of Designing New Machines Should Take a Creative and Independent Path**

      Here an important question arises: Which path should we take to not only catch up with, but also surpass the technical level of foreign countries in a short period of time?

    Some comrades believe that we can only take the path of imitating the technological achievements of foreign practice. Of course, we sometimes have to do this, especially in those industrial sectors where we are temporarily lagging behind. This is economically beneficial, can save costs, and win time. We should never miss the opportunity to learn, even from the enemy, as long as it is beneficial to our great cause. However, this is not the main path for fighting for new technology and for the scientific progress of our motherland. If we take this path, we will inevitably only follow in the footsteps of others, look backward, and doom ourselves to lagging behind capitalist technology.

    It has long been known that only a creative and independent path can lead to discoveries and improvements. The independent, bold, and original spirit of solving problems in the Russian science and technology community has always been well-known. Even in the difficult years of Tsarist autocracy, scientists, engineers, and inventors in our motherland became brave pioneers in many fields of knowledge. They mastered the achievements and discoveries of foreign scientists not to imitate them, but to take a new step forward, play their own role, and thus enrich the science and technology of the motherland. The science and technology community in the old Russia and our Soviet era has produced hundreds of such scientists, engineers, and talented self-taught people, who, through their brave and bold ideas, have not only raised their own motherland, but also all mankind along the ladder of knowledge.

    If we do not take an independent path and do not create the necessary conditions for the creative work of our scientific cadres, we will have neither artificial Earth satellites nor space rockets.

    The reason why we are ahead in atomic energy, aircraft manufacturing, and rocket technology is precisely because we, on the one hand, do not despise the achievements of foreign practice and are good at using these achievements, and on the other hand, take our own creative path. We have established a large number of laboratories, design offices, experimental factories, and powerful devices in these departments, and have cultivated many skilled research and design cadres. Therefore, we are ahead and are justly proud of it. (Applause)

    We have also made not small achievements in ferrous metallurgy, especially in the production process of pig iron. In the most effective use of blast furnace volume, we have surpassed the United States, which Comrade Brezhnev has already talked about in detail yesterday. As everyone knows, we copied the first batch of large blast furnaces from the Americans and built them with the help of American companies and experts. But in a short period of time, we cultivated such cadres who are stronger than the Americans in managing the metallurgical production process. Now, we are leading in managing the technological process and in utilizing the capabilities of our equipment. It is enough to point out the following: we obtain more than 20% more pig iron from each cubic meter of blast furnace volume than the Americans. This is to a large extent due to the fact that the path taken by our scientific and technological thought, although rugged and difficult, is a glorious path of bold exploration and invention.

    Recently, I talked to the designers of the Ural Machine Factory in Sverdlovsk, the machine tool factory in Novosibirsk, and the turbine generator factory. What outstanding people they are - creators of new technologies! They are very familiar with the scientific and technological achievements of their profession at home and abroad. These are people who are never idle, constantly looking for new things, and they are working with enthusiasm and vigor. They reject the path of simply copying foreign technical styles, and advocate taking a creative and independent Soviet path in designing new machines and equipment, and they have achieved not bad results in this regard. A group of Soviet experts who recently visited the United States and Western Europe confirmed that our design ideas are at a very high level in the design and manufacture of equipment, automatic excavators, sintering equipment, heavy machine tools and presses for blast furnaces, open hearth furnaces and rolling mills.

    The task of party organizations at all levels and the National Economic Council is to do everything possible to help our scientists, designers, experts, and production innovators, so as to achieve new progress in the competition with capitalist science and technology in the next seven years.

    The primary responsibility of the economic leaders and party leaders of each economic sector and each enterprise should be to care about how to adopt more efficient production equipment in production as soon as possible, more boldly and more widely. Unfortunately, there are still many indifferent and backward leaders among us who live according to the old saying "haste makes waste."

    Due to the fault of such economic workers, we have many new machines, machine tools, and other equipment that have been left idle in warehouses or rusting on factory sites for many years. As of August 1, 1958, there was the following uninstalled equipment in the national economic sectors of the Russian Federation: about 60,000 metal cutting machine tools, and more than 15,000 sets of punching equipment. Comrades! This is a shameful phenomenon. We must resolutely stop this waste phenomenon.

**It Is Necessary to Bring Scientific Research Institutions Close to Life and Production, Which Will Be Conducive to Improving Production and Enriching Science Itself**

    The task of accelerating the technological development of industry as soon as possible cannot be successfully completed if the scientific and technological bases and experimental bases in the National Economic Council and enterprises are not strengthened and expanded in the most resolute way, and if scientific institutions do not approach life and production. The question now is how to make scientific research institutions and design organizations closer to production faster.

    This is a huge and meticulous work that must be carried out consistently and persistently in order to create all the necessary conditions in the National Economic Council for the further rapid development of industry, ensure a high degree of specialization in production, further technological development, and greatly improve labor productivity on this basis. There is no doubt that this will enrich science itself, because only by maintaining contact with life and production can we promote the development of science. The huge and complex work we are currently carrying out in reorganizing the educational system and reforming schools aims to bring schools closer to life and production. All of this combined will undoubtedly guarantee a new upsurge in various sectors of the national economy in the coming years.

    In the Russian Federation, more than two hundred scientific research institutions have been transferred to the jurisdiction of the National Economic Council. They have approached production and workers - inventors and rationalization proposers. Their activities are now more in line with the requirements of production, and the work they complete is quickly used in the manufacture of new machines, new equipment, new assembly lines, and more rational technological processes. But this is only the first step. We must more resolutely implement the work that has begun to bring scientific research institutions closer to production.

    Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev praised the noble behavior of some famous Soviet scientists and academicians in his report, such as Comrade Lavrentiev, who spoke at the congress yesterday, and Comrades Khristianovich and Sobolev, who proposed to establish new scientific centers in our eastern regions and personally went there to work for a long time. We hope that many other scientists, designers, and scientific institution staff in our country will learn from their example.

    Unfortunately, we still have bad examples. Not long ago, we invited the leaders of some scientific research institutes in Moscow and Leningrad to the Central Committee to discuss with them the possibility of moving some institutes to economic regions to bring them closer to the enterprises they serve. For example, Comrade Krasnichinko, director of the All-Soviet Scientific Research Institute of Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing, participated in the meeting, whose work had been justly criticized by the December Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU. At that time, it was suggested that Comrade Krasnichinko move to Rostov City, the largest agricultural machinery manufacturing center, along with his research institute. Comrade Krasnichinko replied that he himself was from Rostov, loved Rostov and its good climate, loved the Don River, where many of his relatives lived, and he was very happy to meet them, but it was still impossible to go to Rostov to work, because the scale there could not be compared with Moscow. (The audience was active and laughed) However, for the sake of the cause, it seems that Comrade Krasnichinko and his entire staff still have to go to the banks of the quiet Don River in his hometown after all. (Applause)

      Today, Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev talked about the situation in our eastern regions. He knows these regions well and has always paid great attention to them. I would like to follow up on Comrade Khrushchev's words and sincerely suggest to Comrade Krasnichinko: if you don't go to the banks of the quiet Don River, then go to the banks of the turbulent Yenisei River, the strong and handsome man of Siberia, which Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev mentioned today. (Applause)

    A huge base for agricultural machinery manufacturing has already been established there, I am referring to Barnaul, Rubtsovsk, Novosibirsk, and Krasnoyarsk, and this base will be further developed in the next seven years. There is a place to show strength, and the scale is also very huge.

    Comrades, I worked in the eastern regions of our country for more than 20 years according to the will of the party, and now I still recall those years as happy years in my life. Therefore, Comrade Krasnichinko, please believe that my words are sincere - go to the east, and you will be forever grateful for this advice in the future. Our beloved and outstanding writer Anton Pavlovich Chekhov once went to Sakhalin Island. It took him three or four months by stagecoach to get there, instead of taking the "Tu-104" that Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev talked about today. Anton Pavlovich Chekhov also went to the banks of the Yenisei River. When he recalled the scene at that time, he wrote: "... I stood in contemplation: what a fulfilling, wise and courageous life will illuminate these banks! ... On the Yenisei River ... life begins with a groan, but will end with heroism that we can hardly imagine in our dreams." This time has come, and now a fulfilling, wise and courageous life is boiling on the banks of the Yenisei River. (Applause)

      The heavy equipment produced by the Ural Machine Factory is not only designed by the design and process departments of the factory, but also by design institutions in Moscow, Leningrad, Kharkov, Dnepropetrovsk, and other cities. This has resulted in lengthy correspondence and excessive delays in the progress of design work. In the Seven-Year Plan, the Ural Machine Factory is undertaking a large number of design tasks, which requires research and experimentation, and the scale and significance of these tasks exceed the workload of many large-scale scientific research institutes. The comrades in the Urals are very correct in raising a question: to establish a heavy machine manufacturing process design institute within the Ural Machine Factory. We should support them on this issue. In order to establish the new design institute as soon as possible, and to avoid the cumbersome affairs of coordinating and contacting similar design institutes in other cities, some relevant institutions and the necessary skilled cadres should be transferred to Sverdlovsk.

    Comrades! When we formulate long-term plans for the development of all the economy of the country, we should consider which economic sector should develop the fastest in a certain period of time. Now we should immediately promote the development of the power industry. But this depends first and foremost on the level of production of aluminum and copper. Therefore, I would like to talk briefly about the prospects for the development of the production of these metals.

    The control figures of the Seven-Year Plan stipulate that by 1965, the output of aluminum should increase by 1.8 to 2 times compared to 1958. This is a large increase. But despite this, it still cannot meet all the urgent needs of the country. Due to the shortage of aluminum, we have to limit the use of aluminum in the power industry, machine manufacturing industry, and other sectors of the national economy, which has a great adverse impact on the weight of machines and metal structures, the speed of trains, automobiles, and other means of transportation, and the consumption of fuel, and causes us great losses.

    Therefore, we intend to try every means to increase the production of aluminum within the Russian Federation, exceeding the output stipulated by the control figures. In order to solve this task, it is necessary to expand the planned new construction in the Krasnoyarsk Territory (which Comrade Lomako has already talked about at the congress) and the new construction in the Irkutsk Oblast, as well as to further expand the production capacity of existing aluminum smelting plants in the Urals (which Comrade Kirichenko has already talked about in his speech) and the existing aluminum smelting plants in the European part of the Russian Federation.

    In addition to accelerating the development of the aluminum smelting industry, we should also drastically increase the production of copper. It is possible to do this, because a new copper mine with rich reserves has recently been discovered in the Orenburg Oblast, with an average copper content of 4%, and even reaching 11% in individual places. Now the copper smelters in the Urals are far from fully utilizing their production capacity, so quickly arranging the mining of this copper mine is of paramount importance. This can make better use of the production capacity of existing copper smelters (which use lean ore for smelting), which can greatly increase the domestic copper production.

   **The Realization of the Seven-Year Plan Requires Mobilizing All the Creative Forces of the People**
   **Therefore, It Is Necessary to Further Enhance the Leading Role of Party Organizations**

    Comrades! As Comrade Khrushchev said in his report, the Seven-Year Plan is a new milestone in the history of national development. To cross this milestone, the Soviet people must carry out tenacious and intense labor, and must mobilize all the creative forces of our people and utilize all the potential and possibilities of the Soviet socialist system. For this, it is first necessary to further enhance the leading role of party organizations, so that party organizations become the leaders of technological progress, the true inspirers and organizers of the masses fighting for the victorious realization of the grand program of communist construction formulated by the party and supported by the entire people.

    Many party organizations still lack concrete methods, clear objectives, and the ability to effectively influence the work of enterprises and improve their technical and economic indicators in leading industrial work.

    The successful completion of the Seven-Year Plan depends on factories, mines, and construction sites, that is, on those places where material wealth is created. The full attention of all staff of party organizations, state and economic organs should first be focused here, focused on the organizational work of the people.

    In order to effectively lead industry and promote technological progress, there must be more staff in party organs who are familiar with the business and love technology, and who are good at distinguishing between everything new and advanced and everything old and outdated. As the party teaches, we must care for and treat our cadres with caution, educate them in the spirit of unlimited loyalty to the cause of communism, create the necessary conditions for them to carry out highly productive labor, timely support their valuable initiatives and their creative intentions, and more resolutely promote new young cadres to take charge of the leadership work of party, Soviet, and economic organs.

    Party organs must fully intensify the struggle for practicing economy and spend state funds in the spirit of the highest degree of economy. We should not forget that there is also an important reserve for the victorious realization of the Seven-Year Plan.

    Comrades! Our achievements in developing the economy, culture, and improving the lives of the Soviet people are huge. We have made great achievements in developing our multi-ethnic socialist country and consolidating its unshakable foundation - the fraternal friendship between all the

    苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员
    阿里斯托夫在苏共二十一次代表大会上的发言
    新华社4日讯　据苏联“真理报”报道：苏共中央主席团委员阿里斯托夫在苏共第二十一次代表大会1月31日上午会议上的发言，全文如下：
    同志们！我们党、全体苏联人民和我们的外国朋友们以极大的注意注视着苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会。赫鲁晓夫同志“关于1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济控制数字”的报告在苏联每一个角落、在世界各国都得到了热烈的反应。
    在这个具有历史意义的文件中，指出了我们在召开这次代表大会时所取得的卓越成就，揭示了更加丰富多彩的前景，提出了新时期的任务，深刻而全面地论证了党在共产主义建设方面的伟大纲领。这个纲领的生命力、它的现实性在于：它是在全民的参加下依靠党多年来在建立新社会的光荣斗争中所积累的丰富经验而制订的。
    报告的特别宝贵之处在于它是合情合理地、简单明了地、以布尔什维克的热情，用事实和不可辩驳的计算的力量，用明朗的乐观主义使我们确信，我国定能在不远的将来建成共产主义。
    共产党人常常被人称为幻想家。的确是这样。弗·伊·列宁自己就爱幻想我们祖国的未来。他说：“应当幻想”。我们的敌人曾对此加以嘲笑，他们想看到俄国是一个黑暗、贫穷和落后的国家。即使现在，也许有人在回忆赫伯特·威尔斯的话和谈赫鲁晓夫同志报告的时候，会把报告人和我们共产党人，代表大会的参加者称为克里姆林宫的新幻想家。但是我们可以说，我们的伟大计划不是为外国的怀疑派和心怀恶意的人制订的，而是为我国人民制订的。我国人民正在把自己对光辉未来的奥妙的理想付诸实现，他们正在建设新社会。（掌声）
    尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫论证今后七年内苏联发展国民经济控制数字的报告也像探照灯的灯光一样，照耀着远方，在那里共产主义宏伟大厦的轮廓已经隐约可见。在报告中提出了结合我国实际情况具体运用马克思列宁主义理论的一系列新问题。在报告中作出了创造性地发展马克思列宁主义的不朽思想的范例，作出了社会主义在我国不仅取得了完全的胜利、而且也取得了彻底的胜利的重要结论。
    看来，就连外国资产阶级的政治活动家也不得不考虑这一点。七年计划使整个资本主义世界感到震惊，使资本家对社会主义力量的增长感到非常恐惧。他们中间，有些人用战争进行威胁，另一些人在寻找同我们的友谊，这不是偶然的。他们中间大部分人还是主张结束“冷战”和发展东西方广泛的经济和文化联系的。
  十月革命在社会主义制度中埋下巨大动力
  苏联工业增长速度远远超过资本主义国家
    同志们！在尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫的报告中非常重视苏联同主要的资本主义国家美国进行和平经济竞赛的前景，并且指出，在这个竞赛中工业生产的增长速度将起着多么大的决定性的作用。我想比较详细地来谈谈这个问题。
    大家都知道，在苏维埃政权建立以来我国工业平均每年增长的速度，要超过工业发达的资本主义国家的速度二倍到四倍。这表明十月革命在社会主义制度中埋下了多么巨大的动力，十月革命在我国人民中激起了能够创造奇迹的巨大力量。
    我们的国家从令人牢记不忘的年代起开辟了自己新的经济道路，在那时由于第一次世界大战以及后来的国内战争的结果，我们面临着反革命势力的残余和帝国主义国家包围所造成的饥饿和破坏。1920年我们生产的产品只有1913年沙皇俄国工业产品的五分之一。我们到1926年底才恢复到革命前的生产水平。在这个期间美国已经超过1913年水平的50％。
    1925年，我们党在第十四次代表大会上执行列宁的遗嘱，采取了国家工业化的坚定方针。苏联遵循这个方针，在最初的几个五年计划时期内实现了巨大的跃进，使1940年的工业生产比1913年多七倍半。而美国在同一时期的工业产值增加不到一倍。由此可见，我国战前的发展速度就已经比美国高三倍。
    1941年新的更加残酷的战争临到我们祖国头上，妨碍了我们继续进行和平的社会主义建设。因此使我们在工业方面落后了许多年。只是在1948年，我们才超过了战前水平，但是这时美国的工业比1940年已增加了50％。这是完全可以理解的。因为美国经济没有受到战争的考验，美国的工厂没有遭到敌人的轰炸，而军火供应却给资本家带来了巨额的利润。
    但是过了没有多久，1950年我国的工业产值比1913年增加了约十四倍，而美国只增加了二点二倍。这样，甚至把战争时期计算在内，我们的工业产值的增长速度也不比从前低，而比从前高。
    在随后的几年中，苏联和美国工业发展速度的距离越来越大，我国走在前头越来越远。1955年，苏联的工业产值比1913年的水平增加了二十六倍，而美国增加还不到三倍。
    1958年，苏联的工业总产值，如尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫报告中指出那样，比1913年的水平增加了三十五倍，而美国的工业产值仅增加还不到三倍。由此可见，在七年计划前夕，如果同1913年的水平相比，我国的增长速度比美国快八倍半。七年计划的计算表明，同1913年相比，到1965年末我国增长速度将约比美国快十二倍。同志们，你们都可以看到，这就是美国垄断资本家感到发慌的原因！这些材料清楚地表明，我国社会主义制度的巨大力量是如何逐年不断地增长，它对资本主义制度的优越性是如何更加深刻和广泛地显现出来。这样一来，一些为垄断资本服务的资产阶级经济学家关于我国发展速度似乎在减慢的鬼话是一文不值的！资产阶级思想家企图用这种欺骗宣传在本国劳动人民面前掩盖社会主义对资本主义的无可争辩的优越性，在普通人的心目中贬低和歪曲我国共产主义建设成就的伟大意义。但是俗语说，谎言是走不远的，它在真理面前躲不了，逃不开。事实和数字的真理是最雄辩的。
    党的正确政策保证苏联经济高速度发展
    苏维埃人能够完成祖国提出的任何任务
    到底什么东西保证了苏联经济发展的高速度呢？首先是我国的社会主义制度，党的正确的列宁主义政策，这种政策要求优先发展作为提高整个国民经济、加强国防力量和提高劳动人民物质福利的主要基础的重工业。全民的政治和劳动积极性不断高涨这样的因素以及我们拥有许多熟练干部、拥有无穷尽的自然资源，也保证了我国发展的高速度。
    我们比世界上任何国家都富饶。我不仅是指矿藏丰富，而且指我国广阔无垠的肥沃的农业用地。随着进一步研究我国的地下宝藏，我们不断发现新的、简直像神话般的财富，尤其是在西伯利亚和远东。可以毫无差错地说，这些地区在许多世纪中将是发展物质社会生产的主要仓库和最重要的源泉。我国拥有自然资源，这是我国不依靠资本主义世界而独立的重要条件。
    大家知道，美国在天然矿藏蕴藏量方面同其他资本主义国家相比，有着最优越的条件。但是它的资源却丝毫不能同我们祖国的天然富源相比。如果拿已查明的十六种最重要矿藏的世界蕴藏量来说，苏联有十三种占世界第一位。我们的任务就是要以日益增长的规模，以主人翁的态度，最有效地利用这些自然财富。
    弗·伊·列宁指出过，我国东部地区有着丰富的矿藏蕴藏量，这些矿藏必须用来为苏联经济服务。他在“苏维埃政权的当前任务”一文中写道：“用最新技术来开采这些天然富源，就能造成生产力空前发展的基础。”（列宁全集，俄文本第二十七卷二百二十八页，中文本第二百三十五页）
    现在，我们开始采取巨大措施来利用我国东部地区的财富的时候已经到来。七年内对这方面的投资占总投资的40％以上。这样，列宁关于开发西伯利亚和远东丰富的天然资源的理想就正在实现。
    然而，我们最重要的优越性还在于我们是苏维埃人，在于我们的干部，尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫在他的报告中曾经以那样炽爱和热烈的感情谈到他们。这就是熟练的工人、农业能手、专家、科学家、经济工作者和党的工作者。这些人，是党用对共产主义事业无限忠诚的精神教育起来的，他们有着深刻渊博的知识、创造精神和取得胜利的意志，他们有能力解决祖国向他们提出的任何任务。
    我们的时代是在许多科学技术部门都有新发明的时代。现在一些新的巨大任务的解决不是取决于单独的个人，不是取决于个别有才能的科学家和发明家，虽然他们仍然像以前一样，应当享有崇高的荣誉和受到尊敬，他们的名字给人类增添光彩。在我们这里，在苏联，这些人受到特别的珍视。然而，现在一些重大的科学技术问题只有依靠整个集体、甚至依靠许多集体才能解决，而有一些问题只有在全国范围内通过全体人民的努力才能解决。共产党培养出来的我国优秀的科学家、工程师、工人完成了极伟大的功勋，制造和发射出世界上第一批人造地球卫星和宇宙火箭。这些伟大的成就，是我国全体人民的成就，是我们社会主义社会制度的成就。（经久不息的掌声）
    苏联宇宙火箭的发射开辟了研究行星际空间的道路。我们要继续在这条道路上前进。只有我们的社会主义制度才能够进一步探索自然界的奥秘和研究茫茫无际的宇宙。让那些可敬的资本家们来赶我们吧！这也是一种很好的竞赛形式。苏联的力量一年比一年扩展和壮大在同美国的经济竞赛中一定能胜利　同志们！我们苏联人热爱我们的祖国。俄罗斯人过去始终热爱自己的故土，并为其增光。因此我们的历史上充满了许许多多英雄事迹。我们以此为荣。但是现在，当我们看到我们国家的辽阔土地上一天天涌现出新的城市、新的工业企业的时候，当我们的集体农庄和国营农场越来越巩固和繁荣，苏联人民的生活越来越美好的时候，当我们的祖国像果戈里所幻想的那样，好比俄国的三套车，飞驰向前，奔向太阳，奔向共产主义，迫使资本主义国家“退避三舍”的时候，我们国家就更加美好，更为我们大家所珍爱了。（暴风雨般的掌声）我们坚信，像我们英雄的苏联人民这样的人民在同资本主义竞赛中一定能赢得胜利，胜利将是我们的！但是为了加速这一胜利的到来，我们必须很好地了解和研究帝国主义体系和我们的主要对手——美国的强的一面和弱的一面。我们清醒地考虑到，美国是一个高度发达的工业国，美国在科学技术的发展上取得了巨大的成就。我们在同美国进行的历史性竞赛中，不能像横冲直闯的骑手，他不估计自己坐骑的能力，也许在某一圈能赶上自己的敌手，可是在快到终点的时候气喘起来，经不住考验。我们的敌人是希望这样的。但是，他们是盼不到这一点的。我们的力量在日益增大的规模上一年比一年扩展和壮大。昨天“真理报”刊载了一篇来自美国的通讯，其中说，“纽约时报”刊登了一篇文章，标题是“美国经济增长的缓慢速度使人有理由预测，苏联能够赢得竞赛”。文章作者把这种速度比做“龟兔赛跑”，而且他承认美国是龟的速度。的确，我们要赶过美国，我们要像赶过乌龟一样地赶过美国，不过只是骑在自己的工业马上在尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫所说的错车站上赶过美国。苏联在工农业主要产品的总产量和按人口平均计算的产量方面，将在1970年以前赶上并继而超过美国。到那时，我们将有最高的生活水平，将有比任何资本主义国家都高的技术水平。我们将创造出一切条件使人得到全面的协调的发展。到那时候，对于哪种社会制度更完美的疑问将在全世界劳动人民中间最后消失。伟大的列宁早在1920年就说过：“我相信苏维埃政权一定会赶上和超过资本家，我们将不仅赢得纯粹经济方面的优势”。（列宁全集俄文本第三十一卷四百二十七页，中文本第四百一十七页）同志们，我们大家都是幸福的人，因为我们生活在这样一个时代：我们将能亲眼看到最令人向往的列宁的理想变为现实。
    党对过时的管理形式实行大胆的革命变革
    改组工业和建筑业的管理起了良好的效果
    同志们！同我国人民取得的巨大成就相对照，马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫显得多么渺小可怜，他们企图阻止我国在新的条件下发展，企图破坏苏共第二十次代表大会决议的实现。
    共产党和它的中央委员会总结了经济建设和文化建设的经验，对过时和陈腐的管理形式实行大胆的革命变革，创造出新的、更为灵活的领导形式，这些形式符合在我们向共产主义前进的道路上出现的无比加大了的任务。
    我想举出几件具体事实，来说明党是多么正确地解决了关于改组工业和建筑业的管理、关于把生产管理权直接下放到地方、下放到经济区和关于建立国民经济委员会的问题，但这些却曾经遭到反党集团特别猛烈的反对。
    国民经济委员会在地方党组织的帮助下，在其成立以来的一年半时期内，在改善工业和建筑业领导方面，在利用现有潜力方面，在各工厂、矿井和建筑工地采用新技术和对革新装备方面做了许多工作。这仅仅是俄罗斯联邦国民经济委员会活动中的一些例子。
    车里雅宾斯克国民经济委员会对条件进行了研究，并制订了实际的措施，保证通过扩大和改建现有的工厂和把这些工厂现代化的办法使现有的工厂中的生铁、钢和钢材的生产能迅速提高50％以上。这些措施已经苏共中央主席团和政府讨论并且通过，现在正在实现中。这个国民经济委员会还在大力提高钢管生产和发展电力冶金工业。
    斯维德洛夫斯克国民经济委员会的企业采取了重大的措施来提高高炉炼铁用的烧结矿的生产。炉料中烧结矿的含量在最近几年内提高了50％，因而能够大大地提高现有的高炉的生铁产量。这个国民经济委员会的机器制造工厂在1956—1958年期间掌握了约五百种新机器和仪器的生产。
    列宁格勒国民经济委员会的企业在这个时期掌握了六百七十七种新式的机器和仪器的生产，这些机器和仪器都符合现代科学技术的要求。
    在过去的一年半期间内，我们看到国民经济委员会很好地负担起了重大的实际任务，并且在精通地、迅速地和熟练地解决这些任务。
    全俄罗斯联邦1958年的计划任务已经在各个国民经济部门中顺利地完成了。工业方面的年度计划完成了104％。在农业方面所取得的成绩也是很好的：俄罗斯联邦超额完成了向国家出售谷物的计划；此外还超额完成了交售肉类、奶类和甜菜的计划。关于这一点波利扬斯基和梅拉尔希科夫两位同志在这里的代表大会上已经详细谈过了。住宅建筑计划任务也已超额完成。
    不久以前，苏共中央俄罗斯联邦局同俄罗斯联邦部长会议一起在大批专家参加下，详细讨论了共和国发展国民经济七年计划草案。根据客观情况和来自地方的建议，我们认为，1959—1965年俄罗斯联邦发展国民经济计划是完全可以实现的，而且将提前完成。（经久不息的掌声）
    俄罗斯联邦在代表大会前举行的一些党代表会议以及工人和集体农民所举行的无数次的会议都表明，我们共和国的劳动人民完全有信心胜利地完成他们面临的七年计划任务。
      发展生产力应该依靠最新科学技术
      机器制造业是技术进步的主要环节
    同志们！为了在同资本主义的经济竞赛中取得胜利，我们发展国家生产力的整个工作都应当依靠最新的科学成就和发现，依靠最完善的技术。
    我国拥有一切可能在七年计划末尾，无论在工业或者在农业方面都超过西方国家的技术水平。但是为此我们的科学家、工程师、设计师、生产革新者都要作很大的努力。因此我想提出一些问题，我认为这些问题对于发展社会主义工业、苏联科学和技术是很重要的。这些问题是生活本身所迫切地提出来的，但是在国民经济委员会和科学设计机关的工作中远不是经常都考虑到这些问题。
    首先是机器制造业。在我们今天技术迅速而全面地进步的时代里，机器制造业在决定性的程度上决定着国民经济各部门的发展。机器制造业的发展在我们这里要比所有其他工业部门快得多。但是我们仍然不能满足国民经济对于各种机器、设备、仪表和器材的需要。
    在实现七年计划的过程中，我们这里对于轧床、掘土机、重型机床、压延机和其他种重型设备的需要将急剧增长。而且重型机器制造业的工厂，像“乌拉尔机器工厂”、新西伯利亚重型机床和压延机工厂等，任务已经过重。我们必须挖掘更多的潜力来增加俄罗斯联邦现有企业制造重型设备的生产能力。
    同志们！我谈到机器制造业，不仅因为它是技术进步的主要环节，而且也因为俄罗斯联邦在发展全国机器制造业中起主导作用。例如，仅仅“乌拉尔机器工厂”所生产的设备就在很大程度上决定着一系列工业部门的技术水平和发展。在1957年有75％以上的矿砂和80％的石油是用“乌拉尔机器工厂”制造的采矿设备和石油开采设备开采的。冶金工业使用的烧结机有90％以上是这个工厂制造的。“乌拉尔机器工厂”为苏联75％以上的高炉配上了主要设备。更不必说“乌拉尔机器工厂”给予我们兄弟的中华人民共和国、印度和其他国家的巨大援助了。由此可见，单单一个“乌拉尔机器工厂”的影响就有多大。国民经济很多重要部门的生产成就取决于这个工厂制造的机器的效能和完善程度。
    但是必须指出，我们的机器制造工厂往往生产远非完善的、逊色于外国产品的机器。
    使机器制造的技术水平在短期内超过外国设计新机器的工作应走创造性的独立道路
      这里出现一个重要问题：我们要走哪条道路才能在短期内不仅赶上、而且超过外国的技术水平？
    我们有些同志认为，只能走模仿外国实践中的技术成就的道路。当然，我们有时不得不这样做，特别是在那些暂时还落后的工业部门中更是如此。这在经济上有利，能够节省费用，赢得时间。任何时候也不应该放过学习的机会，那怕是向敌人学习，只要这样做对我们的伟大事业有利。但是，这不是为新技术、为我们祖国科学进步而斗争的主要道路。如果走这条道路，我们就不可避免地只能步人后尘，向后看，使自己注定落后于资本主义的技术。
    大家早已知道，只有创造性的独立的道路才能导致发现，导致改良。俄国科学技术界解决问题的独立、大胆和独创的精神是向来著称的。我们祖国的科学家、工程师、发明家甚至在沙皇专制的艰难岁月里也成为很多知识领域中的勇敢的先驱。他们掌握外国科学家的成就和发现并不是为了模仿他们的样子，而是为了向前迈出新的一步，起自己的作用，从而丰富祖国的科学和技术。旧俄时代和我们苏维埃时代的科学技术界产生了数以百计的这样的科学家、工程师和天才的自学家，他们通过自己的勇敢和大胆的思想不仅使自己祖国、而且使全人类沿着知识的阶梯向上提高。
    如果我们不是走独立的道路，不为我们科学干部的创造性工作创造必要的条件，我们就既不会有人造地球卫星，也不会有宇宙火箭。
    我们之所以在原子能、飞机制造和火箭技术方面走在前面，正是因为我们一方面不藐视外国实践的成就并且善于利用这些成就，一方面走自己的创造性的道路。我们在这些部门中建立了大量试验室、设计处、试验工厂、强大的装置，培养了很多熟练的研究和设计干部。因此我们走在了前面，并且为此而感到正当的自豪。（掌声）
    我们在黑色冶金方面也取得了不小的成绩，特别是在生铁的生产工艺方面，在最有效地利用高炉容积方面，我们已经超过了美国，关于这一点勃列日涅夫同志昨天已经详细说过了。大家知道，第一批大型高炉我们是仿造美国人的，并且是依靠美国公司和专家的帮助建设起来的。但是在短期内我们培养出了这样的干部，他们在管理冶金生产过程方面比美国人强。现在，我们在管理工艺过程方面，在利用我们设备的能力方面已经领先。只要指出下面这一点就够了：我们从每一立方公尺的高炉容积所获得的生铁要比美国人多20％以上。这在很大程度上是由于我们的科学技术思想所走的道路虽然崎岖艰巨，但它所走的却是一条大胆探索和创造发明的光荣道路。
    最近，我曾经同斯维德洛夫斯克的乌拉尔机器工厂、新西伯利亚的机床厂和透平发电机厂的设计师们谈了话。这是一些多么出色的人——新技术的创造者！他们很了解国内外关于本行的科学技术成就。这是一些永不安闲、不断地寻找新东西的人，他们热情高涨地、生气勃勃地工作着。他们拒绝了单纯抄袭外国技术样式的道路，而主张在设计新机器和设备方面走创造性的独立的苏维埃道路，并且在这方面获得了不坏的结果。一批不久前曾经访问过美国和西欧的一批苏联专家肯定，在高炉、马丁炉和轧钢机的设备、自动推进掘土机、烧结设备、重型机床和压力机等的设计和制造方面，我们的设计思想处于很高的水平。
    各级党组织和国民经济委员会的任务在于：尽力帮助我们的科学家、设计师、专家、生产革新者，以便在这七年内同资本主义的科学技术进行的竞赛中获得新的进展。
    每个经济部门和每个企业的经济领导人和党的领导人的首要职责应该是，关心如何尽快地、更大胆和更广泛地在生产中采用生产效率更高的生产设备。很遗憾，我们中间尚有不少那种漠不关心的落后的领导者，他们按照“欲速则不达”这句老谚语过活。
    由于这样一些经济工作人员的过失，我们有很多新的机器、机床和其他设备长年累月地搁置在仓库里或在工厂的场地上生锈。俄罗斯联邦国民经济部门中截至1958年8月1日为止就有以下未安装的设备：约六万台金属切削机床，一万五千套以上的冲压设备。同志们！这是一种可耻的现象。我们必须坚决制止这种浪费现象。必须使科学研究机构接近生活和生产这将有利于提高生产和充实科学本身
    如果不最坚决地加强和扩大国民经济委员会中和企业中的科学技术基地和实验基地，如果科学机关不接近生活和生产，那末尽快地加速工业的技术发展的任务是不可能顺利完成的。现在的问题是，如何使科学研究机关、设计组织更快地接近生产。
    这是一项巨大而又细致的工作，必须始终一贯地、顽强地进行这一工作，以便在国民经济委员会中为工业的进一步快速发展创造一切必要的条件，保证生产的高度专业化、技术的进一步发展以及在这个基础上大大提高劳动生产率。毫无疑问，这将充实科学本身，因为只有同生活、同生产保持联系，才能推动科学向前发展。我们目前在改组国民教育制度和改革学校方面所进行的巨大而复杂的工作，其目的是使学校接近生活和生产。所有这一切加在一起，无疑将保证今后一些年内在国民经济各个部门有一个新的高涨。
    在俄罗斯联邦有二百多个科学研究机构已移交国民经济委员会管辖。它们已接近生产，接近工人——发明者和合理化建议者。它们的活动现在更符合生产的要求，它们所完成的工作很快就用在制造新机器、新设备、新流水作业线和更合理的工艺过程方面。但这只是第一步。我们必须更坚决地实现已开始的、使科学研究机构接近生产的工作。
    尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫在他报告中表彰了一些著名的苏联科学家、科学院士的高尚的行为，如昨天在这里代表大会上发言的拉夫连捷夫同志，提出了在我国东部建立新的科学中心的主张并亲自到那里去做长期工作的赫里斯齐安诺维奇同志和索波列夫同志。我们希望，我国其他许多的科学家、设计师和科学机构工作人员也学习他们的榜样。
    很遗憾，我们还有不好的事例。不久以前我们请了莫斯科和列宁格勒的一些科学研究所的领导人到中央委员会来同他们讨论这样一个问题：把一些研究所迁往经济区，使它们接近它们所服务的企业这样做的可能性如何。例如，全苏农业机器制造科学研究所所长克拉斯尼钦科同志就参加了会议，他的工作曾受到苏共中央十二月全会的公正批评。当时建议克拉斯尼钦科同志随同自己的研究所迁到最大的农业机器制造中心罗斯托夫城去。克拉斯尼钦科同志回答说，他本人是罗斯托夫人、爱罗斯托夫和那里的良好的气候，爱顿河，那里住着他的许多亲戚，他很高兴能同他们会面，但是到罗斯托夫去工作还是不成，原来是因为那里的规模不能同莫斯科相比。（全场活跃，笑声）但是，为了事业，看来克拉斯尼钦科同志和他的全体工作人员毕竟还得要到那故乡的静静的顿河的岸边去。（掌声）
      今天尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫就谈到我国东部地区的情况。他很了解这些地区，并始终对它们十分注意。我愿意接着赫鲁晓夫同志的话真心诚意地建议克拉斯尼钦科同志：如果不去静静的顿河的岸边，那末就到尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫今天所提到的、西伯利亚的强壮的美男子——汹涌澎湃的叶尼塞河岸边去。（掌声）
    那里已经建立了农业机器制造业的巨大基地，我指的是巴尔瑙尔、鲁布佐夫斯克、新西伯利亚和克拉斯诺雅尔斯克，在今后七年中这个基地还将得到更大的发展。那里有地盘可以施展力量，同时规模也是十分巨大的。
    同志们，我曾根据党的意志在我国东部地区工作了二十多年，而现在仍把这些年代作为我生活中的幸福年代来回忆。所以，克拉斯尼钦科同志，请相信我说的话是真诚的——到东部去吧，今后你是会永远感谢这个劝告的。我们爱戴的杰出作家安东·帕夫洛维奇·契呵夫曾到过库页岛。他当时坐驿站马车花了三四个月才到那里，而不是乘尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫今天所谈过的“图—104”去的。安东·帕夫洛维奇·契呵夫也到过叶尼塞河岸边。他回忆起当时的情景时写道：“……我伫立沉思：多么充实、智慧和勇敢的生活将要照耀着这些岸边！……在叶尼塞河上……生活以呻吟而开始，但将以豪迈而结束，这种豪迈是我们梦里也难以想像的”。这种时候来到了，现在充实、智慧和勇敢的生活正在叶尼塞河岸上沸腾着。（掌声）
      “乌拉尔机器工厂”所生产的重型装备并不单是该厂的设计处和工艺处设计的，现在还有莫斯科、列宁格勒、哈尔科夫、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克等城市的设计机构参加工作。这样产生了长时期的信件来往，过分拖延了设计工作的进度。七年计划中，“乌拉尔机器工厂”担负大量设计任务，为此需要进行研究和实验，这些任务的规模和意义超过了许多大规模科学研究所的工作量。乌拉尔的同志们十分正确地提出了一个问题：要在“乌拉尔机器工厂”内设立一所重型机器制造工艺设计院。应该在这个问题上支持他们。为了使新的设计院尽快地建立起来，并免去同其他城市的类似设计院取得配合和联系的庞杂事务，应该把某些有关的机构以及必需的熟练干部调到斯维尔德洛夫斯克去。
    同志们！我们在制订发展国家一切经济的远景计划时，应该考虑到在一定时期内哪一个经济部门应该发展最快。现在我们应该立刻推动电力工业的发展。但是这首先取决于铝和铜的生产水平。因此我想简短地谈一谈这些金属的生产发展前景。
    七年计划控制数字规定，到1965年，铝的产量要比1958年增加一点八倍至两倍。这是一个很大的增长量。但是尽管如此，它仍然不能满足国内全部迫切的需要。由于铝的不足，我们不得不在电力工业、机器制造工业和其他一些国民经济部门中限制铝的使用量，结果，对机器和金属结构的重量、火车、汽车和其他运输工具的速度、燃料的消费都有很大的不利影响，并且使我们受到很大损失。
    因此我们打算多方设法在俄罗斯联邦内部增加铝的生产量，超过控制数字所规定的产量。为了解决这个任务，需要扩大克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边疆区原定的新建设（这一点洛马科同志已经在代表大会上谈过了）和伊尔库次克州的新建设，也需要进一步扩大乌拉尔现有炼铝工厂的生产能力（这一点基里钦科同志已经在他的发言中谈到了），以及俄罗斯联邦欧洲部分现有炼铝工厂的生产能力。
    除了加速制铝工业的发展以外，我们还应该急剧增加铜产量。做到这一点是可能的，因为不久前在奥伦堡州发现了一个新的储藏量丰富的铜矿，它的平均含铜量为4％，有个别地方甚至达到11％。现在乌拉尔的炼铜厂还远远没有充分利用它的生产能力，因此迅速地安排这个铜矿的开采有着头等意义。这样可以更有利地发挥现有炼铜厂的生产能力（这些工厂是用贫矿冶炼），由此可以大大增加国内的铜产量。
    实现七年计划需要动员人民一切创造力量
    因此首先必须更加提高党组织的领导作用
    同志们！正如赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中所说的，七年计划是国家发展历史上的新的里程碑。要跨过这个里程碑，苏联人民就必须进行顽强的、紧张的劳动，就必须动员我国人民的一切创造力量和利用苏维埃社会主义制度所具有的一切潜力和可能性。为此，首先必须更加提高党组织的领导作用，使党组织成为技术进步的领导，成为群众为胜利实现党所拟定的、全体人民所拥护的共产主义建设宏伟纲领而斗争的真正的鼓舞者和组织者。　许多党组织在领导工业的工作中还缺乏具体方法、明确的目的性以及有效地影响企业的工作和提高它们的技术经济指标的本领。
    七年计划的胜利完成取决于工厂、矿山、工地，也就是说取决于那些创造物质财富的地方，党组织、国家和经济机构的全体工作人员的全部注意力首先应该集中在这里，集中在对人们的组织工作上。
    为了有效地领导工业，使技术前进，党的机关内必须有更多的熟悉业务和热爱技术、善于把一切新的和先进的事物同旧的过时的事物区别开来的工作人员。正如党所教导的，必须关心和慎重地对待我们的干部，以对共产主义事业无限忠诚的精神教育他们，为他们进行高度生产率的劳动创造必要的条件，及时支持他们的宝贵的倡议、他们的创造意图，更坚决地提拔新的年轻的干部来担负党、苏维埃和经济机关的领导工作。
    党的机关必须全力加紧为厉行节约而进行的斗争，本着最高度的节约精神来花费国家资金。我们不应该忘记，这里也有胜利实现七年计划的重要后备力量。
    同志们！我们在发展经济、文化和改善苏联人的生活方面的成就是巨大的。我们在发展我们多民族的社会主义国家和巩固它的不可动摇的基础——苏联各族人民之间的兄弟友谊方面获得了巨大的成就。
    共产党的力量在于它是用马克思列宁主义的理论武装起来的，在于我们党的队伍日益团结一致，在于它同千百万劳动人民群众的牢不可破的、日益增长的联系。应该说，党和人民的不可动摇的团结一致，兄弟的社会主义民族的牢不可破的友谊，整个社会主义阵营的不可战胜的力量——这些就是我们百战百胜的可靠保证，是我们沿着共产主义道路前进的决定性条件。　在列宁主义的旗帜下，向社会主义胜利前进！　（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
