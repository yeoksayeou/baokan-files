    The Taohuawu woodblock New Year pictures of Suzhou, along with the Yangliuqing of Tianjin and Yangjiabu of Shandong, are famous folk arts in our country with a long history.

    Historically speaking, Taohuawu woodblock New Year pictures can be traced back to Song and Yuan dynasty woodblock printing, but at that time, woodblock printing was only used for illustrations in books. It wasn't until the Ming dynasty that a unique style of New Year pictures was formed, then called Suzhou-style New Year pictures. During the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Qing dynasty, sales became even more widespread, and from then on, the reputation of Suzhou-style New Year pictures spread throughout the country, becoming something deeply loved by the vast number of farmers.

    Taohuawu New Year pictures are entirely printed with woodblocks, unlike the Yangliuqing New Year pictures, which first use woodcuts to print outlines and then use manual coloring. Although it has long been produced using relatively simple manual methods, and only uses five colors: red, yellow, green, blue, and black, it has achieved a brilliant and intense effect. Moreover, the composition is full, the images are prominent and distinct, and it is full of decorative interest, forming a unique national style that is very likable.

    The production process of New Year pictures can be divided into three steps: drawing the draft, wood carving, and printing. After the artist draws the draft, it is handed over to the engraver. The method of wood carving is to paste the draft in reverse on the wooden board, then use moxa grass to thin the paper, so that the drawing lines are clearly visible from the reverse side. Then use a beveled knife to carve out the lines, and then use a round knife or a flat knife to remove the blank spaces, thus carving a set of plates with different yin and yang patterns. Then, the printing workers gradually print the colors to create a beautiful New Year picture.

    There are many varieties of Taohuawu New Year pictures, which can be divided into three categories for the sake of introduction: The first category is superstitious things, such as door gods, stove gods, flower gods, and many evil-averting figures (such as Jiang Taigong, who is immune to all taboos); the second category is decorative paintings with auspicious meanings, such as "A Harmonious Gathering," "The Boy Brings Profit," "Liu Hai Scattering Gold Coins," "New Year Picture" and some pictures related to agricultural affairs such as "Spring Ox Picture" and "Pastoral Picture"; the third category is story and opera pictures. This category has a very wide range, including ancient and modern, customs and current events, with single sheets and continuous sheets, such as "Wu Song Fighting the Tiger," "Flower and Fruit Mountain," "Mount Dingjun," "Xuanmiao Temple Fair," and so on. In the past, the content of Taohuawu New Year pictures met the many frank demands that farmers had for life, such as "Chicken Suppressing Royal Residence" and "Cat Catching Mice," reflecting the farmers' demands for family hygiene and their desire to protect production at the time.

    Because of the love of the broad masses of working people for Taohuawu New Year pictures, a special group of salesmen emerged at that time to make a living from this. Their sales method was very interesting: every year from the tenth month of the lunar calendar until before silkworm rearing in the following year, they took advantage of this relatively idle period for farmers to travel through various villages and towns to promote sales. When selling, they would post the pictures in small teahouses, small restaurants, or streets and alleys, and then use the tune of "Singing Spring" to introduce the content and stories of each picture. They sang and spoke vividly and interestingly, attracting a large number of farmers wherever they went. Later, when new offset printing, copperplate printing, and lithographic printing methods became popular, new pictures such as "calendar posters" seized the market for Taohuawu New Year pictures, causing many New Year picture workshops to gradually close down and change careers. Business plummeted, and very few woodcarvers continued to work.

    Until after liberation, thanks to the concern of the Party and the government for this cultural heritage, the Taohuawu Woodblock New Year Picture Group was established. They selected forty-six pieces with healthy ideological content from the original old plates and continued to print and sell them. In 1952, they also compiled and printed a "Selection of Taohuawu Woodblock New Year Pictures," including more than two hundred old New Year pictures. On the other hand, they also carved some New Year pictures with new content. From then on, Taohuawu New Year pictures began its new spring.

    桃花坞的木版年画
    尤玉淇
    苏州桃花坞的木版年画，与天津杨柳青和山东杨家埠的木版年画，同为我国历史久远的著名民间美术。
    桃花坞的木版年画，从历史上讲起来，还得远溯宋元的雕版印刷，但那时候的雕版印刷，还是仅用于书本上的绣像画而已。待明代之后才形成一种独特的年画风格，当时称之谓姑苏版年画。到了清朝乾隆、嘉庆时行销更广，从此姑苏版年画的名声就遍布大江南北，成为广大农民衷心喜爱的东西了。
    桃花坞的年画完全是用木版套印，与杨柳青年画那种先用木刻印出轮廓，再用人工填色的方法不同。虽然长期以来它一直是运用比较简陋的手工方法进行生产，在色彩上仅只用红、黄、绿、蓝和黑五种颜色，但却达到了绚烂强烈的效果。而且构图饱满，形象突出主次分明，富于装饰趣味，形成一种独特的民族风格，很惹人喜爱。
    年画的制作过程可分画稿、木刻、印刷三个顺序。当画师画好稿子之后，就交给刻工。木刻的方法是把稿子反贴在木板上然后用木兀草把纸砂薄，使画纹从反面清楚地透出来，然后用斜刀刻出线条，再用圆刀或平刀铲去空白，就这样刻成各种阴阳纹不同的一套版子。于是就由印刷工人逐步套印成为色彩美丽的年画。
    关于桃花坞年画的品种是很多的，现在姑且分为三大类来介绍：第一类是迷信一类的东西，如门神、灶神、花神以及许多辟邪人物（如百无禁忌的姜太公）；第二类是含有吉利性的装饰画片，如“一团和气”、“娃娃得利”、“刘海洒金钱”、“岁朝图”以及一部分有关农事方面的“春牛图”、“丰牧图”等图片；第三类是故事戏文的画片，这类画的范围非常宽广，有古有今，风俗时事，有单张，有连续，例如“武松打虎”、“花果山”、“定军山”、“玄妙观庙会”等等。桃花坞年画的内容，在过去时代是符合当时农民对生活提出许多的坦率要求的，如“鸡镇王宅”、“蚕猫逼鼠”，反映了当时农民对家庭卫生的要求和保护生产的愿望。
    由于广大劳动人民对桃花坞年画的喜爱，所以当时产生了一种专门以此为生的推销商。他们推销的方法很有趣：每年从农历十月份起，到第二年养蚕之前为止，乘这个农民比较闲暇的时期，历遍各处村镇，进行推销。销卖时在小茶馆、小饭馆或者街头巷尾将画张贴起来，然后用“唱春”的调子，介绍每一张画的内容、故事，他们说唱得生动有趣，每到一地便能吸引大批农民。后来，新的胶版、铜版和石印的印刷方法流行了，所谓“月份牌”之类的新画片，夺去了桃花坞年画的市场，使许多年画作坊逐渐歇业改行，营业一落千丈，木刻艺人继续工作的也寥寥无几了。
    直到解放以后，由于党和政府关怀这一项文化遗产，成立了桃花坞木刻年画小组。他们从原有的旧版子中，挑选出思想内容健康的四十六幅，继续印刷销售。1952年还编印过一套“桃花坞木刻年画选集”。包括二百多种旧的年画。另方面还刻了一些新内容的年画。从此，桃花坞年画开始了它的新的春天。
