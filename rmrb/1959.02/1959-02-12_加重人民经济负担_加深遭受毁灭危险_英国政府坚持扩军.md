Xinhua News Agency, London, 11th -- The annual "Defense Report White Paper" published by the British government on the 10th indicates that Britain will continue to implement its plan to intensify the expansion of armaments, focusing on nuclear weapons.

The following points in the White Paper clearly illustrate this situation:

First, the total military expenditure for 1959-1960 will be £1,514 million, an increase of approximately £50 million over the previous year's military budget of £1,465 million.

For several years, British military spending has consistently accounted for more than one-third of the total budget. This expenditure places a very heavy economic burden on the British people and is undermining the country's economic foundation. However, the White Paper indicates that the huge military expenditure will further increase.

Second, the British government is continuing to implement the so-called five-year "defense" plan stipulated in 1957, stepping up the development of nuclear weapons and rocket weapons, despite the growing mass movement in Britain against this suicidal policy.

The White Paper indicates that in this regard, the British government will accelerate the development of the "Blue Streak" long-range missile and accelerate the production of nuclear warheads mounted on missiles.

Third, the quota for recruiting new soldiers into the army will be increased to 180,000 instead of the originally planned 165,000. The White Paper states that the increased personnel will be used to strengthen the forces overseas and strategic reserves. This shows that the British government is attempting to intensify the suppression of national liberation movements in the colonies.

The White Paper announced that a decision has been made to establish a joint command in the Mediterranean as soon as possible, including the British armed forces stationed there, and that the establishment of a similar joint command in the Far East is being studied.

The "Daily Worker," commenting on the White Paper, said that one of the main reasons why Britain has no plans to improve the people's lives is that the government is pursuing a suicidal policy of expanding armaments. This policy not only causes unnecessary waste and squandering, but also increases the risk of a war that would certainly lead to Britain's destruction.

The Conservative Party's "Daily Mail" also pointed out that a military expenditure of £1.5 billion is not "affordable" for Britain. The newspaper expressed the hope that Britain and other countries could achieve some degree of disarmament.

### 加重人民经济负担　加深遭受毁灭危险  英国政府坚持扩军

    加重人民经济负担　加深遭受毁灭危险
    英国政府坚持扩军
    发表国防白皮书再增军费五千万镑
    新华社伦敦11日电　英国政府10日发表的一年一度的“国防报告白皮书”表明，英国将继续推行加紧扩充军备的计划，重点放在核武器方面。
    白皮书的以下各点清楚地说明了这种情况。
    第一、1959到1960年的军费总开支将为十五亿一千四百万英镑，这比前一年军费概算增加约五千万英镑，前一年的军费为十四亿六千五百万英镑。
    几年来，英国军费开支一直占预算总额的三分之一以上。这笔开支使英国人民的经济负担十分沉重，并且正在破坏这个国家的经济基础。但白皮书表明，巨额军费将进一步增加。
    第二、英国政府正在继续执行1957年规定的所谓五年“防御”计划，加紧发展核武器和火箭武器，尽管英国国内反对这种自杀政策的群众运动越来越高涨。
    白皮书表明，在这方面英国政府将要加速发展“蓝光”式的长程导弹以及加速生产装在导弹上的核弹头。
    第三、陆军征募新兵的限额将增加到十八万，而不是原来计划的十六万五千名。白皮书说，所增加的人员将用来加强海外部队和战略后备队的力量。这表明英国政府企图加紧镇压殖民地的民族解放运动。
    白皮书宣布已经决定在地中海尽快建立一个包括那里的英国三军的联合司令部、并且正在研究在远东成立同样的联合司令部。
      “工人日报”在评论这个白皮书时说，英国所以没有改善人民生活的计划，主要原因之一是政府执行自杀性的扩充军备的政策。这个政策不仅造成无谓的挥霍和浪费，而且也增加了爆发使英国肯定会遭到毁灭的战争的危险性。
    保守党的“每日邮报”也指出，十五亿英镑的军事开支不是英国“所能负担的”。这家报纸表示希望英国同其他国家能够实现某种程度的裁军。
