	Brief News Items
	Hand-Cranked Tape Recorder
	The Shanghai China Record Factory has recently produced a "hand-cranked tape recorder" using domestically produced materials. This recorder is much lighter and more portable than ordinary electric tape recorders. It is equipped with a lightweight DC battery and a spring-wound mechanism. The body has a folding wooden hand crank. As long as the crank is turned by hand, the transmission mechanism inside will rotate.
	
	Developing Photos Without a Darkroom
	Traditionally, photographic developing and printing are carried out in darkrooms, and workers are often deprived of sunlight. Especially in summer, the rooms are poorly ventilated and the temperature is high, which has a significant impact on their health.
	
	Workers in the photography industry in the Zhongshan District of Lüda (Dalian) City, Liaoning Province, have converted old flat tables into darkroom work liberation platforms, enabling them to develop and print photos in ordinary rooms, greatly improving working conditions.
	
	Magical "Anti-Fog Water"
	The Shanghai Five Fragrance Products Factory has recently produced a Panda brand "Anti-Fog Water." When applied to eyeglass lenses, water vapor will not condense on the lenses, even when entering a steamy kitchen. Anti-Fog Water is a necessary item for production personnel who wear glasses. For example, if a worker enters a steam engine room, applying Anti-Fog Water once will make the entire day's work easier. It can also be used on certain glass instruments that are sensitive to water vapor condensation, window glass in some factories, and car windshields.

    上海中国唱片厂最近用国产材料制成一种“手摇磁带录音机”。这种录音机比一般电动录音机轻便得多，可以随身携带。机内装有轻便直流电池，设有发条装置，机身安有折叠木手摇把。只要用手摇动摇把，机内传动装置就可转动起来。
    印相片不必进暗室
    照相业的洗相、印相，一向都是在暗室里操作的，职工经常不见阳光，特别是在夏季，屋中不通风，气温高，对身体健康有很大影响。
    辽宁省旅大市中山区照相业职工，利用旧平面桌，改成暗室工作解放台，从而在普通屋子里就可洗相、印相，大大改善了劳动条件。
    奇妙的“去雾水”
    上海五花香品厂最近生产一种熊猫牌“去雾水”，把它擦在眼镜片上，即使进入蒸汽弥漫的厨房，水蒸汽也不会凝聚在镜片上。去雾水是戴眼镜的生产人员需要的物品，如工人进蒸汽车间，擦一次去雾水，就使一天工作方便。某些怕水汽凝聚的玻璃仪器，某些工厂的窗用玻璃，汽车上的前玻璃窗，都用得着它。
