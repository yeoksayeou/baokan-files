Xinhua News Agency, February 4th: According to a report in "Pravda": The speech by Comrade Mukhitdinov, Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, at the 21st Congress of the CPSU on the morning of January 30th. The full text is as follows:

    Comrades! Comrade Khrushchev's report to this congress summarized the victories of world-historical significance achieved by the Soviet people since the 20th Party Congress, formulated a program for comprehensively expanding the construction of a communist society with profound scientific basis, and further developed the theory of Marxism-Leninism. The realization of the Seven-Year Plan formulated by the Party will prove with new force the undeniable superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, will make the balance of power on the international stage even more favorable to socialism, and will become a decisive stage in guaranteeing the Soviet Union's victory in the peaceful economic competition with the most developed capitalist countries.

    In a multinational country like ours, the consistent pursuit of an internationalist national policy is one of the most important conditions for victoriously fighting for the victory of communism. We owe the harmonious development of national relations in our country according to the principles of the great family of nationalities—the indestructible cornerstone of the Soviet state—to Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, to the great work carried out by the Party, and to the powerful Russian people. The practice of dividing nationalities into oppressed and oppressing, exploiting and exploited, backward and advanced, "historical" and "non-historical" is incompatible with our country. More than one hundred nationalities and tribes in the Soviet Union enjoy equal rights and work side by side as members of the great family of the Soviet people.

    The measures implemented by the Party in domestic and international life in the past five years have further enriched the theory and practice of Lenin's national policy. The 21st Congress of the Party is a new historical milestone in the development of the multinational Soviet state. Now, please allow me to talk about some issues of national policy from domestic and international perspectives.

    **Further Economic and Cultural Prosperity of All Nationalities in the Soviet Union**
    **Formerly Backward National Border Areas Have Become Advanced Republics**

    The Bolshevik Party embarked on the October Revolution with a consistent internationalist national program comprehensively formulated by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, and our Party has been implementing this program since the establishment of Soviet power. This is primarily manifested in the establishment and development of national states of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. A broad program to eliminate the actual inequalities between nationalities left over from the old system was established. This program stipulated establishing and developing industry (including heavy industry) in the national republics, transforming agriculture on a socialist basis, carrying out a cultural revolution, and cultivating a large number of cadres from the working class and national intellectuals.

    In retrospect of the past road, our Party can proudly say that it has gloriously fulfilled Lenin's behests, established complete mutual trust, close relations, and truly fraternal friendship among all nationalities in the Soviet Union, and strengthened their moral and political unity. The Party has helped all nationalities across the country establish their own national states, and within a short historical period, has helped them eliminate economic and cultural backwardness, guaranteed the establishment of modern industry, and turned backward national border areas into highly developed industrial and collective farm republics.

    This is a common characteristic of all fifteen republics, but this characteristic is most evident in the eastern republics of our country, where the working masses leaped over the stage of capitalist development and advanced from patriarchal feudal relations and colonial slave status to socialism. The increase in total industrial output in 1958 compared to 1913 was as follows: Uzbekistan increased by sixteen times, Kazakhstan increased by forty-three times, Georgia increased by thirty-four times, Azerbaijan increased by thirteen times, Kyrgyzstan increased by forty-nine times, Tajikistan increased by thirty times, Armenia increased by fifty-four times, and Turkmenistan increased by nineteen times.

    Amazing achievements have been made in cultural development. Before 1917, many nationalities in Central Asia, the Far North, and other remote areas of Russia were almost entirely illiterate. During the Soviet era, more than forty nationalities (Kyrgyz, Kabardian, Circassian, Adyghe, and other nationalities) created their own scripts and developed their own languages. In the member republics, the network of schools, universities, and scientific research institutions is constantly expanding, and academies of sciences have been established. Many writers, artists, and composers have grown up in various places, theaters have been established, and national newspapers and periodicals have been greatly developed.

    Russia, Ukraine, and other nationalities in our country have played a huge role in improving the economy and culture of the eastern republics. Textile workers from Ivanovo helped Uzbeks, Georgians, Tajiks, and other fraternal nationalities establish their own textile industries. Miners from Donbas and Kuzbas helped Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and Uzbeks establish the coal industry. Metallurgical workers from the Urals and Ukraine participated in the construction and commissioning of metallurgical factories in the South Caucasus and Central Asia, and helped workers in Central Asia and Kazakhstan learn to make steel. Machine-building workers from the central and southern regions directly participated in the establishment of the machine-building industry in the national republics. Universities, colleges, and other higher and secondary schools in Moscow, Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, Kiev, Kharkov, and other cities in the Russian Federation and Ukraine have provided great assistance to the eastern republics in establishing universities, colleges, and other higher and secondary schools, and they have been and still are the furnaces for cultivating highly skilled national cadres. In implementing the historically significant resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Party and the government have taken a series of measures to further expand the power of the member republics and local party organizations and Soviet organs in leading industry and construction, in the judiciary, education, science, culture, finance, and other issues of economic and cultural construction. The national state organizations of the Balkars, Kalmyks, Chechens, Ingush, and Caucasian Turks were restored. All of this has promoted the further economic and cultural prosperity of all nationalities and tribes in the Soviet Union, promoted the development of the sovereignty of the member republics, increased their role in solving the fundamental problems of the national economy, further strengthened mutual trust between all nationalities, and increased the creative initiative and enthusiasm of the masses.

    The participants of the anti-Party group showed chauvinistic sentiments, they did not believe that the cadres of the national republics were capable of solving national tasks. The crushing of the anti-Party group promoted the further strengthening of the friendship of all nationalities, and further united all nationalities around the Party.

    The direct contact between the leaders of the Party and the state and the working people of the national republics has been greatly enhanced, which is a very significant event in recent times. Members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU have visited most of the member republics. The huge role and initiative of Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev in this regard must be particularly pointed out. He learned about the life of the republics of Central Asia, the Baltic coast, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Belarus, exchanged opinions with local cadres, and often interacted with the people. He always found the main link, and grasping this link can guarantee the further upsurge of the economy and culture. For example, for Kazakhstan and the eastern regions of our country, the reclamation of wasteland and the vigorous development of some extremely important industrial sectors there are such key issues. Some former leaders of Kazakhstan did not adequately understand the huge potential of the republic in developing grain. Now every Soviet person sees that this measure is completely correct and far-sighted, it has promoted the great increase in Kazakhstan's grain output and the great improvement of its entire economy.

    In some republics, due to the mistakes made by individual local leaders in cotton planting and the incorrect stance taken, backwardness and conservatism once prevailed not long ago, which hindered the further increase in cotton production. Due to resolute measures, in the past two or three years, advanced planting methods have been adopted in the cotton planting industry based on the experience of advanced collective farms and state farms. In 1958, cotton farmers obtained the highest yield, and they sold 4.4 million tons of cotton to the state. Cotton farmers are proud of their achievements, and they thank the great Russian people, and the Central Committee of the Party and the Soviet government headed by Comrade Khrushchev. (Applause)

    In the republics, highly educated cadres, cultivated with the spirit of proletarian internationalism, loyal to the cause of communism, and good at managing the economy according to the requirements of the state, have grown up.

    **Huge and Rapid Development of Economic Sectors in the Eastern Region**
    **Explain that the Seven-Year Plan Embodies Lenin's National Policy**

    The Seven-Year Plan once again embodies Lenin's national policy. The plan stipulates that the first priority is to develop those economic sectors in each republic that are most favorable in terms of natural and economic conditions. In this way, it is possible to more effectively utilize the resources of the republics and ensure that the interests of the local and national are correctly combined. This gives rise to a series of characteristics of the Seven-Year Plan, especially for the eastern regions of the Soviet Union. Where are these characteristics?

    The first characteristic is that the growth rate of productivity in the eastern region is stipulated to be higher than that of the entire Soviet region. More than 40% of the total investment is used in this part of the region. This will greatly increase the proportion of the eastern region in the output of extremely important products in the country.

    The second characteristic is that in the next seven years, there will be a qualitative change in the economy of the eastern region, that is, increasing kinetic energy and greatly developing major industrial sectors. Kazakhstan, which accounts for a large proportion of the country's output of non-ferrous metals and rare metals, will organize the production of pig iron for the first time; steel output will increase by fourteen times, and man-made fiber output will increase by nine times. Uzbekistan will be at the forefront of developing the gas industry in the Soviet Union. The gas output here will increase from 172.2 million cubic meters in 1958 to 18.3 billion cubic meters in 1965, an increase of 105 times. It is planned to use the gas resources of Bukhara, Turkmenistan, and Karadag to complete the gasification of major industrial enterprises and meet the living needs of most areas and urban residents in Central Asia, the South Caucasus, and the southern and central states of Kazakhstan. By 1963, the Bukhara-Chelyabinsk gas pipeline (2,100 kilometers in length) and the Gazli-Sverdlovsk gas pipeline (2,300 kilometers) will transport up to 20 billion cubic meters of gas from Central Asia to the Urals every year.

    The third characteristic is that the further specialization of agriculture in the republics will also be vigorously developed in the next seven years. In the Central Asian republics, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, the complete mechanization of all production processes of cotton planting will be completed in the next few years, and it is stipulated to massively reconstruct irrigation systems and add engineering structures to the irrigation network. The proposals of advanced collective farms and state farms on fundamentally changing the cotton product procurement system are of great significance. Until now, we have been procuring seed cotton. This was correct when collective farms and state farms were small and weak. Now they have become large-scale, diversified and powerful economic sectors, and they have tractors and other technical equipment. Now collective farms and state farms should gin and dry cotton themselves. To this end, the necessary material production base must be created in the next three or four years. State organs should transition to procuring lint and cotton seeds. The implementation of these proposals can greatly increase yield per unit area, improve the quality of cotton, and reduce the cost of cotton.

    It can be seen from this that the Seven-Year Plan fully conforms to the Party's programmatic requirements for ensuring the planned and proportionate development of the national economy and for ensuring that all socialist nations in the Soviet Union advance towards communism in unison. The economic and political commonality of all nationalities are strengthening and must also create the necessary conditions for closer proximity.

    In Comrade Khrushchev's report, the scientific theoretical basis of the Party's national policy under the conditions of comprehensively expanding communist construction was formulated. In Marxist-Leninist works, in addition to some basic programmatic principles, some extremely representative national characteristics are also stipulated. Now these national characteristics have been enriched with new content and some characteristics that unite all nationalities in the Soviet Union into a unified communist family.

    Among these characteristics is the closest commonality of all nationalities in the Soviet Union in economic life, which is manifested in the consistency of socialist production relations, in the public ownership of the means of production, and in the consistency of the entire economic system developed according to a unified plan, which stipulates the all-Soviet division of labor between the republics. Among these characteristics also includes the socialist democracy of the national union principles of the member republics, which is manifested in the voluntary nature of their union, and in the sovereignty and equal rights of each member republic. Then take the spiritual commonality of all nationalities in our country, which is manifested in the consistency of thought, the commonality of moral and political principles, the socialist content of culture, and the consistency of goals and interests in the struggle for communism.

    Finally, and most importantly, is the leadership and guiding role of the Communist Party. The Communist Party itself is a living embodiment of proletarian internationalism. The Party uses ardent Soviet patriotism, unlimited loyalty to the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism, the spirit of solidarity with all the working people of the socialist camp, the solidarity with the international workers' movement and the communist movement. To educate all nationalities in our country, to educate all nationalities in our country with the spirit of supporting the people of colonial and dependent countries who are fighting for freedom and independence.

    All this shows the strengthening of the commonality of socialist nations and the new phenomena that have occurred in our country's national policy. It must be emphasized that due to the complete and thorough victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, and due to the strengthening of the friendship and brotherly relations of all nationalities, the principle of proletarian internationalism has taken on the nature of socialist internationalism here.

    The essence of the Party's national policy under the current conditions lies in fully developing the economy and culture of all socialist nations on the basis of comradely cooperation and mutual assistance, and creating the necessary conditions for their closer proximity. It is necessary to care about the requirements of national characteristics and national sentiments, and to fight against the remnants of nationalism and chauvinism. At the same time, we should, as before, follow the Party's requirements that we must pay close attention to the characteristics and feelings of each nationality. The great Lenin warned: "Nothing hinders the development and strengthening of the class unity of the proletariat as much as national inequality. There is nothing that 'injured' nationalists are as sensitive to as the feeling of equality and the fact that this equality is violated, even if this violation is due to carelessness, even if this violation takes the form of a joke." (Lenin's Collected Works, Russian version, fourth edition, Volume 36, pages 556-557). Lenin was an incomparable model of sympathy and concern, and he severely condemned any slight manifestation of nihilism, contempt, and lordly attitude towards national characteristics and feelings.

    Every nation is proud of its history, culture, and its contribution to the development of world civilization. We should fully support this noble sentiment, while not forgetting that the culture of the nation is constantly enriched by all the wealth created by mankind.

    Our country is a multinational country, and therefore also a multilingual country. Every nation naturally strives to develop its own language. But the Russian language is greatly respected and loved by all nationalities in our motherland, and it is a powerful tool for mutual communication between all nationalities. Everyone knows how great the desire to learn Russian is now all over the world, and the rich Russian language has become one of the most popular and universally recognized languages ​​for people to communicate with. Therefore, during the national discussion on the reform of the national education system, it was rightly emphasized that both local languages ​​and Russian must be learned in the national schools of the republics. The utmost importance must be attached to this noble desire of the Soviet people to master local languages ​​and Russian perfectly.

    Comrades! The huge tasks of the Seven-Year Plan require all party workers, Soviet and economic workers to be good at correctly understanding and fulfilling their internationalist and national obligations, and to constantly fight against the remnants of nationalism and chauvinism. This remnant is primarily manifested in localism, which allows the harmful sentiment of placing narrow national interests above national interests to be revived in the minds of individuals.

    Under the socialist system, the working people of all nationalities require more concerted efforts to solve economic and political tasks. Therefore, establishing a closed-door economy within the republics and requiring tendencies of self-sufficiency are harmful and dangerous to the interests of the country and each nationality. Individual workers may, under the pretext of fully developing the economy, hope that everything is "their own" and local, regardless of whether it is economically beneficial and suitable for the country, and do not understand the significance of the all-Soviet allocation of material resources and monetary funds.

    In literature and art and historical science, there are also some manifestations of national limitations. Individual workers violate objective facts, beautify the former feudal period, regard the national cultural heritage from the anti-Marxist-Leninist theoretical standpoint of "one vein inheritance," and do not give due attention to the comprehensive research and popularization of the Soviet historical period full of great revolutionary ideas and heroic deeds. The remnants of nationalism have long ceased to be a widespread phenomenon in our country, because these remnants have no social, political, and economic roots here. However, the corrosive influence of imperialist propaganda, which strives to restore and maintain the remnants of capitalism in the consciousness of individual backward people, must be fully assessed. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly and unremittingly fight against the remnants of the past, especially the remnants of a nationalistic nature.

    The magnificent program of further economic and cultural upsurge stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan has aroused a new upsurge of strength, pride, and creative initiative among the Soviet people. Undoubtedly, the party organizations and Soviet organs, and the working people of all nationalities and tribes of our great motherland will guarantee the complete realization of the program of communist construction. (Applause)

    **The Smooth Resolution of the National Question in the Soviet Union Has Great International Significance**
    **Enslaved People See the Soviet Union as Their Ally**

    Comrades! The smooth resolution of the national question in our country has great international significance, especially for the people of Asia and Africa, because some of them have already broken free from, or are breaking free from, colonial enslavement and are embarking on the road of national independence.

    The Soviet Union is a true friend of the people of Eastern countries. Comrade Khrushchev comprehensively explained the brotherly relations between the Soviet people and the people of Asia, Africa, and other continents, and expressed the Soviet state's firm, consistent, and principled support for the efforts of oppressed nations to seek freedom and independence.

    The history of mankind has formed this situation: imperialism has divided the world into a small number of privileged nations and a vast number of enslaved nations. It once ran rampant in Asia and Africa, strangling and destroying the economies of colonies and dependent countries, and cruelly plundering and exploiting their human and natural resources. It was not until after the great October Socialist Revolution that the situation in the East underwent fundamental changes. This revolution stirred up millions of working masses and mobilized them. The enslaved people of colonies and dependent countries saw in the Soviet state a loyal friend and powerful ally in the struggle against imperialist oppression.

    The victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, the crushing of the fascist bloc in World War II, and the emergence and consolidation of the world socialist system have greatly weakened imperialism and created favorable conditions for the victorious struggle of the people of oppressed countries for national independence. The People's Republic of China, the Mongolian People's Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have achieved great successes on the road of building socialism. This has had a huge revolutionary impact on the entire process of national liberation struggles of the people of Asia and Africa.

    India, Indonesia, the United Arab Republic, Ceylon, Burma, Iraq, and many other Asian and African countries have broken free from the political rule of colonialists. Many countries with a total population of 1.4 billion have been liberated from the shackles of colonialism. But there are still about 160 million people living colonial lives.

    Colonialism has suffered a complete and thorough defeat in Asia. Therefore, imperialism is increasingly clinging to Africa—its remaining colonial stronghold. More than 130 million African residents are suffering under colonial oppression. The awakening of the people of all countries in Africa, a continent with mythical natural wealth but where the indigenous residents are destitute, is one of the most important phenomena of our time. The clear wind of national liberation is now also blowing over the African continent, and new independent countries—Libya, Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, Ghana, and Guinea—are emerging one after another on this continent. In the last one or two years, according to the decision of the United Nations, the so-called trust territories of Togo and Italian Somaliland should also obtain national independence. Nigeria, Rhodesia, and Nyasaland have also been allowed to obtain formal independence. The heroic struggle of the Algerian people for their freedom and independence has received the full sympathy and support of the Soviet people and all progressive mankind. The people of Congo have plunged into an active liberation struggle against Belgian and American colonialists. The desire of the people of all countries in Africa for true national freedom was clearly manifested at the Accra Conference, and the slogans raised at the Accra Conference were: "Imperialists get out of Africa!" and "This generation wants independence!".

    **National Independence States Must Still Eliminate All Colonial Remnants**
    **Expanding Democracy and Uniting People of All Strata is of Great Significance**

    The anti-imperialist revolution has enabled the people of many countries to achieve national independence, which is their greatest historical achievement. However, solving economic, political, and social problems requires more than just national independence, although it is the main condition for independent development.

    The desire of Eastern countries to eliminate backwardness is now manifested in nationalization policies, developing national industries, implementing land reforms of extremely important significance, encouraging the policies of state-owned enterprises, and attempting to use planning principles in the economy. However, the reactionaries in many countries rely on their privileges to obstruct the implementation of these measures, and even directly collude with imperialism and establish direct alliances.

    The people of Eastern countries cannot fail to see that the colonial countries, which are divided due to internal sharp contradictions, conflicts, competition, and crises, are now uniting their forces to deal with the national liberation movement. The Atlantic Treaty is not only an aggressive tool in Europe, but also aimed at the people of Asia and Africa. Similarly, aggressive organizations such as the Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization are also aimed at uniting the strength of capitalist countries' monopoly organizations to carry out joint expansion in Africa and Asia. This is what is now called "collective colonialism."

    The people of Eastern countries have established their own front to confront the imperialist front. The historically significant Bandung Conference was an important milestone on this road. The Bandung Conference showed the great unity of Asian and African countries in the struggle against imperialism. The ideas of the Bandung Conference were reaffirmed at the Cairo and Tashkent conferences. These ideas are so powerful because they reflect the spirit and urgent requirements of the current era. The desire of the Arabs, Africans, and other people of the East to unite is justified and in accordance with the law as proven by history, and the Soviet people fully agree with this just desire of theirs. However, as some people in the East have pointed out, only unity that can more broadly carry out the struggle to eliminate all colonial remnants is in the interests of all peoples. Anti-imperialist content is the main criterion for this unity. If this unity is built on the principles of goodwill and takes into account the historical, economic, and social characteristics of each nation, and is built on the basis of equality, respect for independence, and sovereignty, then this unity may be fruitful.

    For countries that have been liberated from the shackles of colonialism, it is of particular significance to strive to expand democracy and unite people of all strata. The development of India in this regard is very meaningful. Undoubtedly, India still needs to do a lot to completely eliminate the consequences of colonialism and ensure social and economic progress. But there is also no doubt that due to the far-sighted policies implemented by Prime Minister Nehru, an outstanding statesman of the East, and the government he leads, as well as the activities of all progressive forces, India has achieved well-known achievements in developing industry, agriculture, and the entire economy, in ensuring national unity, and in improving India's international prestige in a short historical period.

    But in some countries in the East, after driving out the colonialists, some people are now attempting to contract democracy. Everyone knows that the more the national leaders and the government can unite the masses, the more they can rely on the people in all their activities, especially on the advanced part of the people, the more they can fully expand the democratic rights of the people, improve their living standards, and ensure solidarity with the fraternal people, that is to say, the more they can realize everything that the outstanding sons and daughters of all nationalities have struggled, shed blood, and sacrificed for, the higher their prestige will be.

    It is no coincidence that in countries where anti-democratic tendencies appear, the US dollar or the British pound, or both, will come to help, and the imperialists will intensify their political conspiracies there and intensify propaganda to intimidate with the so-called "communist threat." The propaganda of the imperialists is first and foremost aimed at the Communists, accusing them of being enemies of national unity, hoping to create divisions among the emerging countries of Asia and Africa and alienate the residents of all strata of these countries. But who does not know that the argument that accuses the Communists of not serving the interests of their own nation is pure slander. This accusation is beneficial to the imperialists and therefore arouses the legitimate indignation of all progressive people. The Communists in the East, like the Communists in all countries, are the most steadfast and consistent fighters who struggle for the cause of the people and for the happiness of mankind! (Applause)

    The Yugoslav revisionists betray the great principles of proletarian internationalism and international solidarity for the sake of narrow nationalistic interests and chauvinistic interests. They help the imperialists carry out subversive activities in Asian and African countries. The revisionists want to confuse some political leaders in the young republics of the East, and want to make them distrust the policies of the Soviet Union and the policies of other socialist countries. The actions of the revisionists damage the true interests of the people of Asian and African countries.

    The Soviet people are pleased that the voices of Delhi and Cairo, Rangoon and Baghdad, Jakarta and Accra, and the capitals of other sovereign countries in Asia and Africa resound at international conferences; if their calls are not listened to, no one can successfully implement international policies. A group of countries has emerged in the world that has declared non-participation in imperialist military blocs as its national policy, and they have chosen the famous "Panchsheel" principles as the basis of their foreign policy. A broad "peace area" including many countries in Asia and Africa has emerged, which is fully supported by the Soviet government.

    **Imperialists are Dying Struggles to Maintain Colonial System**
    **Dragging Asian and African Countries into Military Blocs is the Main Method**

    Imperialist countries are making dying struggles to prevent the complete destruction of the colonial system. With the support of American monopoly organizations, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Portugal are doing everything possible to maintain the remnants of their colonial empires, obstruct the people of all countries from realizing their right to self-determination, launch colonial wars, and suppress the legitimate demands of the people of all countries for independence. American imperialism has played a particularly disgraceful role in all these aspects.

    American monopoly capitalists and war maniacs collude with other imperialist countries and adopt various means—plotting conspiracies, carrying out bribery, provocations, directly carrying out armed intervention, providing notorious "aid," etc.—to deal with countries that are unwilling to follow American policies. Recently, the world has seen the armed intervention in Lebanon and Jordan, the provocations against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan Strait, the rebellion of the Indonesian reactionary groups that conspired to undermine national unity, some conspiracies plotted in the young Republic of Iraq, and many other subversive activities against the people of Eastern countries.

    The imperialists are trying to drag Asian and African countries into military blocs and sign military-political agreements with them, which is an extremely important form of disguised colonialism. Now, in the East, people are justly saying: "The blocs that the West wants to impose on us are to restore colonialism in our countries, but in a new form. Imperialism, like a chameleon, always changes color in order to cover up its true nature." The notorious Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine has gone bankrupt. Now the US imperialists are attempting to sign bilateral military agreements with Iran, Turkey, Pakistan, and some other countries.

    Real life conclusively shows that this has not brought and cannot bring any benefits to any country that has military obligations connected with imperialist countries. On the contrary, it makes each of them deeper into the clutches of so-called assistance. Not only do the people of various countries not see the improvement of their lives, but they are increasingly aware of the harm of this policy to their national development. Therefore, it is no coincidence that the more the ruling groups in these countries want to strengthen their alliance with imperialism, the more unpopular they become in the eyes of the masses.

    The Iraq incident is a proof. This country was once regarded as a bastion of imperialism in the Far East, and there was once a barbaric reign of terror in the country. But what was the result? In just one and a half to two hours, under the impact of the people, what the British and American imperialists had painstakingly built up through Nuri al-Said and his followers for forty years completely collapsed. No Baghdad Pact could help the imperialists prevent their policy from suffering such bankruptcy in the Near East. The reactionaries in some neighboring countries got the "Nuri al-Said disease": they were afraid of the anger of the people, colluded with imperialism, and betrayed their own national interests.

    This is the situation of the policy of the United States and other colonial countries in the East. The essence of this policy lies in making colonial enslavement re-emerge and be restored, and to preserve it forever.

    **The Soviet Union Regards Eastern Countries as Truly Equal Friends**
    **Provides Economic Assistance Without Interfering in Their Internal Affairs**

    The Soviet state can be proud of the fact that it was the first in human history to establish a truly new type of international relations without any selfish intentions. The mutual relations between the Soviet Union and Eastern countries are based on the principles put forward by the Communist Party. Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, a great friend of the people of Eastern countries, once said that the foundation of Soviet foreign policy would be: "Completely severing relations with the barbaric policies of the bourgeois civilized world, which are to enslave hundreds of millions of working people in Asia and all colonial weak countries, and to seek benefits for the exploiters of a few special nations." (Lenin's Collected Works, Russian version, Volume 26, page 386).

    In the past five years, major changes have taken place in our relations with Eastern countries. This is manifested in the further strengthening of political, economic, and cultural ties between the Soviet Union and Asian and African countries, and the establishment of personal contacts between the leaders of the Soviet government and the leaders of other countries.

    The Soviet Union expands equal economic relations with Eastern countries and gives them more and more economic assistance, while not interfering in their internal affairs, and regards them as truly equal friends. Eastern countries can obtain the machinery and equipment they most urgently need from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Therefore, it is no wonder that the trade and economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and Eastern countries is developing so rapidly and fruitfully. The total trade volume between the Soviet Union and Asian, African, and Latin American countries increased more than four times from 1953 to 1957. In 1958, the Soviet Union only had economic agreements with three Eastern countries, but now it has economic agreements with fourteen Asian and African countries. At the beginning of 1955, the total obligations undertaken by the Soviet Union for economic and technical cooperation with Asian and African countries were not large, only tens of millions of rubles in total. Now, the total amount of long-term loans given is billions of rubles. The loans from the Soviet Union are extremely preferential. The interest rates on these loans are very low, and they can generally be repaid in local currency or in goods that these countries usually use for export. The Soviet state and all socialist countries implement this policy out of a fervent desire to help the independent economic development of the people of Eastern countries.

    The characteristic of economic cooperation is that the Soviet Union helps other countries build enterprises, primarily heavy industry enterprises. Our mutual relations with India, the United Arab Republic, and Afghanistan can serve as obvious examples. The Soviet Union also has economic agreements with countries such as Yemen, Burma, Indonesia, Ceylon, Iraq, Ethiopia, and Cambodia.

    Our ability to help underdeveloped countries is not limited to industrial development. The Soviet Union can also greatly help solve urgent tasks in agricultural development, establish modern healthcare undertakings, and train planning personnel for the national economy and cadres in many other fields.

    The friendly relations between the Soviet Union and economically underdeveloped countries are of great help in maintaining the independence of these countries and preventing the aggression of imperialists. When Britain, France, and Israel invaded Egypt in 1956, and when Syria was subjected to political threats and shameless attacks of military provocations in 1957, and when the US and Britain intervened in Lebanon and Jordan in 1958, the Soviet Union firmly supported the struggle of the Arab people every time.

    Colonialism will inevitably fail completely, and the national liberation movement will surely win complete victory, but the people of all nationalities in the East must always be vigilant and not forget the conspiracies of the imperialists, who will never give up their attempts to restore their original rule in Asian and African countries.

    The Soviet Union and all socialist countries have been and will always be the loyal friends of the people of all nationalities in the East. The Soviet people themselves have traveled a difficult road to overcome generations of backwardness. They understand very well and fully sympathize with the desires of the people of all nationalities in the East, and like brothers, they sincerely wish them success in the arduous cause of building a new life, striving for complete political freedom, national independence, prosperity, and happiness. (Applause)

    Comrades! The more than two hundred million citizens of our motherland are children in a great family united by unbreakable friendship, common views, and united action. This is the source of the strength of the Soviet state and the guarantee of the victory of communism!

    Glory to our dear Communist Party—the great creator of the unbreakable fraternal friendship of all nationalities! (Stormy and prolonged applause)

    穆希金诺夫在苏共二十一次代表大会上的发言
    新华社4日讯　据“真理报”报道：苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员穆希金诺夫同志1月30日上午在苏共第二十一次代表大会上的发言。全文如下：
    同志们！赫鲁晓夫同志在这次代表大会上的报告，总结了自第二十次党代表大会以来苏联人民所取得的具有世界历史意义的胜利，有深刻科学根据地制定了全面展开共产主义社会建设的纲领，并且进一步发展了马克思列宁主义的理论。党所制定的七年计划的实现，将以新的力量证明社会主义制度对资本主义制度的无可争辩的优越性，将使国际舞台上力量的对比变得更加有利于社会主义，并成为保证苏联在同最发达的资本主义国家的和平经济竞赛中取得胜利的决定性阶段。
    在我们这样的多民族国家里，始终不渝地奉行国际主义的民族政策，是胜利地为共产主义胜利而斗争的最重要条件之一。在我们国家内民族关系之所以能根据各民族大家庭——苏维埃国家牢不可破的基石——的原则协调地发展，我们应当归功于弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁、归功于党所进行的巨大工作、归功于强大的俄罗斯人民。那种把各民族分为压迫的和被压迫的、剥削的和被剥削的、落后的和先进的、“历史的”和“非历史的”的作法，对我国是格格不入的。苏联境内的一百多个民族和部族都享有平等的权利，都作为苏联各族人民大家庭的成员而在并肩劳动。
    党近五年来在国内和国际生活中所实行的措施，更加丰富了列宁主义民族政策的理论和实践。党第二十一次代表大会是多民族的苏维埃国家发展中的一块新的历史里程碑。现在请允许我从国内和国际意义的角度来谈一谈民族政策的一些问题。
    苏联各族人民的经济和文化进一步繁荣
    原来落后的民族边区已成为先进共和国
    布尔什维克党是带着弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁全面拟订的一贯的国际主义民族纲领而着手实行十月革命的，我们党自苏维埃政权建立以来就开始实行这个纲领。这首先表现在苏联各族人民的民族国家的成立和发展上。消灭旧制度遗留下来的各民族之间实际不平等的广泛纲领确定下来了。这个纲领规定在各民族共和国内建立和发展工业（其中包括重工业）、在社会主义基础上改造农业、实行文化革命、大量培养工人阶级的干部和民族知识分子。
    我们党在回顾已往的道路时，可以自豪地说，它光荣地完成了列宁的遗训，建立了苏联各族人民之间的完全的互相信任、亲近的关系和真正兄弟般的友谊，加强了它们在道义上和政治上的团结一致。党帮助全国各族人民建立了自己的民族国家，在短短的历史时期内帮助各民族消灭了经济和文化的落后状态，保证建立了现代化的工业，使落后的民族边区变成了高度发达的工业和集体农庄的共和国。
    这是所有十五个共和国的共同特点，但这个特点在我国东部各共和国表现得最为明显，那里的劳动群众越过资本主义发展阶段，从宗法封建关系和殖民地奴隶地位跃进到了社会主义。1958年整个工业总产值比1913年增长的情况如下：乌兹别克增长了十六倍，哈萨克增长了四十三倍，格鲁吉亚增长了三十四倍，阿塞拜疆增长了十三倍，吉尔吉斯增长了四十九倍，塔吉克增长了三十倍，亚美尼亚增长了五十四倍，土库曼增长了十九倍。
    在文化发展方面取得了惊人的成就。1917年
  以前，中亚细亚、极北地区和俄罗斯其他边远地区的许多民族几乎全部
  是文盲。在苏维埃政权年代里，有四十多个民族（吉尔吉斯族、卡巴尔达族、年次族、阿第盖族及其他民族）创造了自己的文字并发展了本民族的语言。在各加盟共和国里，学校、高等学校、科学研究机关网在不
  断扩大，科学院成立了。许多作家、艺术家、作曲家在各地成长起来了，剧院成立了，民族报刊得到了很大发展。
    俄罗斯、乌克兰和我国其他民族在提高东部各共和国的经济和文化
  方面起了巨大作用。伊凡诺佛的纺织工人帮助乌兹别克人、格鲁吉亚人、塔吉克人和其他兄弟民族建立了自己的纺织工业。顿巴斯和库兹巴斯的矿工帮助哈萨克人、吉尔吉斯人、乌兹别克人建立了煤炭工业。乌拉尔和乌克兰的冶金工人参加了南高加索和中亚细亚各冶金工厂的建设和投入生产的工作，帮助中亚细亚和哈萨克的工人学会了炼钢。中部和南部的机器制造工人直接参加了各民族共和国机器制造工业的建立工作。莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯维德洛夫斯克、基辅、哈尔科夫以及俄罗斯联邦和乌克兰其他城市的高等学校在建立大学、学院以及其他高等学校和中等学校方面曾给予东部各共和国很大帮助，它们过去和现在一直是培养高度熟练的民族干部的熔炉。党和政府在实现苏共第二十次代表大会的具有历史意义的决议时，采取了一系列的措施来进一步扩大各加盟共和国以及地方党组织和苏维埃机关在领导工业和建筑业方面、在司法、教育、科学、文化、财政方面以及经济文化建设其他问题方面的权力。恢复了巴尔卡尔人、加尔梅克人、契琴人、印古什人、高加索土耳其人的民族国家组织。这一切促进了苏联各民族和各部族的经济和文化的进一步繁荣，促进了各加盟共和国主权的发展，提高了他们在解决国民经济的根本问题方面的作用，进一步加强了各族人民之间的相互信任，提高了群众的创造性主动性和积极性。
    反党集团的参加者表现了沙文主义情绪，他们不相信各民族共和国的干部有能力解决全国性的任务。反党集团的被粉碎，促进了各民族友谊的进一步加强，使各民族进一步团结在党的周围。
    党和国家领导人同各民族共和国劳动人民的直接联系大大地增强了，这是近来的一个极重大的事件。苏共中央主席团的委员们视察过大多数加盟共和国。必须特别指出尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫在这方面的巨大作用和主动精神。他了解了中亚细亚、波罗的海沿岸、哈萨克、乌克兰和白俄罗斯各共和国的生活，跟地方干部交换了意见，经常同人民交往，他总是找到主要的环节，抓住这个环节就可以保证经济和文化的进一步高涨。比如，对于哈萨克和我国东部地区来说，开垦荒地、大力发展那里的一些极重要工业部门，就是这样的关键问题。哈萨克过去的某些领导人对于本共和国在发展谷物方面的巨大潜力理解不足。现在每个苏联人都看到这个措施是完全正确的和有远见的，它促进了哈萨克的谷物产量的大大增加和它的整个经济的大大提高。
    在一些共和国，由于个别地方领导人在种植棉花方面所犯的错误和采取的不正确立场，不久前落后现象和保守主义曾经占了上风，结果阻碍了棉花产量的进一步提高。由于采取了坚决的措施，最近两三年根据先进集体农庄和国营农场的经验，植棉业已经采取了先进的种植方法。1958年棉农获得了最高的产量，他们卖给国家的棉花有四百四十万吨。棉农为取得的成就而骄傲，他们感谢伟大的俄罗斯人民，感谢以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的党中央委员会和苏联政府。（掌声）
    在各共和国，有高度教养的、用无产阶级国际主义精神培养起来的、忠于共产主义事业和善于按照国家的要求管理经济的干部已经成长起来了。
    东部地区经济部门将有巨大而迅速的发展
    说明七年计划体现了列宁主义的民族政策
    七年计划再一次体现了列宁主义的民族政策。计划规定首先发展每个共和国在自然条件和经济条件方面最有利的那些经济部门。这样，就有可能更有效地利用各共和国的资源，并保证使地方和全国的利益正确地结合起来。由此就产生了七年计划的一系列特点，特别是对苏联的东部地区。这些特点在什么地方呢？
    第一个特点在于，东部地区生产力增长的速度规定得比苏联整个地区高。占投资总额40％以上的资金用在这部分地区。这将使东部地区在全国极重要产品产量方面所占的比重大大增加。
    第二个特点在于，今后七年，在东部地区的经济中将发生质的变化，即增加动能和大大发展主要工业部门。在有色金属和稀有金属产量方面在国内占有很大比重的哈萨克，将第一次组织生铁生产；钢的产量将增加十四倍，人造纤维的产量将增加九倍。乌兹别克在苏联发展瓦斯工业方面将位居前列。这里的瓦斯产量将从1958年的一亿七千二百万立方公尺增加到1965年的一百八十三亿立方公尺，即增加一百零五倍。拟定利用布哈拉、土库曼和卡拉达格的瓦斯资源来完成主要工业企业的瓦斯化和满足中亚细亚、南高加索、哈萨克的南部和中部各州的大部分地区和城市居民的生活需要。到1963年，布哈拉—车里雅宾斯克瓦斯管（全长二千一百公里）和加兹里—斯维德洛夫斯克瓦斯管（二千三百公里）每年将把达二百亿立方公尺的瓦斯从中亚细亚输送到乌拉尔。
    第三个特点是：各共和国农业的进一步专业化也将在今后七年中得到大力发展。在中亚细亚各共和国、在阿塞拜疆和亚美尼亚，今后几年将完成植棉的一切生产过程的全盘机械化，规定要大规模改建灌溉系统和在灌溉网上增设工程建筑物。先进集体农庄和国营农场的关于根本改变棉产品采购制度的建议具有很大意义，到目前为止，我们采购的是籽棉。当集体农庄和国营农场很小而且能力不强的时候，这样做是正确的。现在它们成为大规模的、多种经济的和强大的经济部门，它们拥有拖拉机和其他技术设备。现在应当由集体农庄和国营农场自己来轧棉和干燥棉花，为此，在今后三、四年内要创造必要的物质生产基础。国家机关应当过渡到采购皮棉和棉籽。这些建议的实现，能够大大地提高单位面积产量，提高棉花的质量和降低棉花的成本。
    由此可见，七年计划完全符合党关于保证国民经济有计划按比例发展、关于使苏联各社会主义民族向共产主义齐步迈进的纲领性要求。各民族经济政治等方面的共同性在加强还要为更加密切的接近创造必要的条件
    在赫鲁晓夫同志的报告中制定了在全面展开共产主义建设的条件下党的民族政策的科学理论基础。在马克思列宁主义著作中除了一些基本的纲领性原理之外，还规定了一些极有代表性的民族特征。现在这些民族特征已被新的内容和一些把苏联各民族团结成统一的共产主义大家庭
  的特质丰富了起来。
    在这些特质之中有着苏联各族人民在经济生活中最密切的共同性，这一共同性表现在社会主义生产关系的一致上，表现在生产手段的公有制上，表现在按照统一计划发展的整个经济制度的一致上，这个统一计划规定在各共和国之间实行全苏联的劳动分工。在这些特质之中还包括着各加盟共和国的国家联合原则的社会主义民主，这种民主表现在它们联盟的自愿性上，表现在每一个加盟共和国的主权和平等权利上。再拿我国各族人民精神上的共同性来说，这种共同性表现在思想的一致、道德政治原则的共同、文化的社会主义内容，以及在为共产主义而斗争中的目标和利益的一致上。
    最后，也是最主要的，是共产党的领导和指导作用。共产党本身就是无产阶级国际主义的活生生的体现。党用热烈的苏维埃爱国主义、对马克思列宁主义伟大思想的无限忠诚、同社会主义阵营全体劳动人民的团结、同国际工人运动和共产主义运动团结的精神。来教育我国各族人民，用支持为自由和独立而斗争的殖民地和附属国人民的精神来教育我国各族人民。
    这一切都说明社会主义各民族共同性的加强，说明我国在民族政策方面所发生的新现象。必须强调指出，由于社会主义在苏联的完全而彻底的胜利，由于各民族友谊和兄弟关系的加强，无产阶级国际主义原则在我们这里已经具有了社会主义国际主义的性质。
    目前条件下党的民族政策的实质在于，在同志合作和互助的基础上全面发展一切社会主义民族的经济和文化，为他们的更加密切的接近创造必要的条件。必须关切民族特点和民族感情的要求同民族主义和沙文主义的残余作斗争同时我们也同从前一样，应当遵循着党的关于必须十分注意每个民族的特点和感情的要求。伟大的列宁警告说：“没有什么东西像民族的不平等那样阻碍无产阶级的阶级团结的发展和加强，‘受委屈的’的民族人士对什么也没有像对平等的感情和对这种平等遭到被破坏的事实这样敏感，那怕这种破坏是出于粗心，那怕这种破坏是采取开玩笑的形式。”（列宁全集俄文本第四版第三十六卷第五百五十六—五百五十七页）。列宁是同情和关切的无比的模范，他严厉谴责对民族特点和感情采取虚无主义、轻视和老爷式的态度的任何细微表现。
    每个民族都为自己的历史、文化和他们对发展世界文明所作出的贡献而感到骄傲。我们应当全力支持这种高尚感情，同时也不要忘记，民族的文化不断为人类所创造的一切财富所丰富。
    我国是多民族的，因而也是多种语言的国家。每个民族都自然要努力发展本民族的语言。但是俄语在我们祖国各民族受到巨大的尊重和热爱，它是各民族互相交往的强有力的工具。大家知道，现在全世界对于学习俄语的渴望是多么大，丰富的俄语成了人们用来交往的最流行和得到普遍承认的语言之一。因此在全民讨论关于改革国民教育制度时，人们正确地强调指出，在各共和国的民族学校中必须既学习地方语言，又学习俄语。对于苏联人完善地掌握地方语言和俄语的这种高尚愿望必须给予最大的重视。
    同志们！七年计划的巨大任务要求所有的党的工作者，苏维埃和经济工作人员善于正确地了解和履行自己的国际主义的和民族的义务，不断同民族主义和沙文主义的残余作斗争，这种残余首先表现在地方主义上，地方主义使那种把狭隘民族利益置于全国利益之上的有害情绪在个别人心理中死灰复燃。
    在社会主义制度条件下，各族劳动人民要求更加同心协力地来解决经济和政治任务。因此在共和国内建立闭关自守的经济以及要求自给自足的倾向表现，对国家利益和每个民族都是有害和危险的。个别工作人员可能在全面发展经济的借口下，希望一切都是“己有的”、地方的，不顾经济上是否有利和对全国是否适宜，不了解全苏分配物质资源和货币资金的意义。
    在文艺和历史科学方面，民族局限性也有一些表现。个别工作人员违反客观事实，美化从前的封建时期，从反马克思列宁主义的“一脉相承”的理论立场来看待民族文化遗产，而对于充满伟大革命思想和英雄事迹的苏维埃历史时期的全面研究和普及工作却没有给予应有的重视。民族主义的残余在我国老早就不是广泛的现象了，因为这种残余在我们这里没有社会的、政治的和经济的根源。但是，不能不充分地估计到帝国主义宣传的腐蚀影响，帝国主义宣传，力求在个别落后的人的意识中恢复和保持资本主义残余。因此必须经常地、毫不松懈地同过去的残余，特别是同民族主义性质的残余进行斗争。
    七年计划所规定的经济和文化进一步高涨的宏伟纲领引起苏联人的力量、自豪感和创造性主动性的新高涨。无疑，党组织和苏维埃机关、我们伟大祖国各民族和部族的劳动人民必将保证完全实现共产主义建设的纲领。（掌声）
    苏联顺利解决民族问题具有巨大国际意义
    被奴役的人民看到了苏联是他们的同盟者
    同志们！我国民族问题的顺利解决具有巨大的国际意义，特别是对于亚非各国人民，因为他们有的已经摆脱，或正在摆脱殖民主义奴役，正在走上国家独立的道路。
    苏联是东方各国人民的真正的朋友。赫鲁晓夫同志全面地说明了苏联人民同亚非和其他洲人民的兄弟关系，表示苏维埃国家坚决地、始终不渝地和有原则地支持被压迫民族求得自由和独立的努力。
    人类的历史形成了这种情况：帝国主义把世界分裂成一小部分特权民族和广大的被奴役的民族。它曾经在亚洲和非洲横行霸道，扼杀和破坏殖民地和附属国的经济，残酷地掠夺和剥削它们的人力和自然资源。直到伟大的十月社会主义革命以后东方的情况才发生了根本的变化，这个革命激起了千百万劳动群众，使他们行动起来了。殖民地和附属国的被奴役的人民在苏维埃国家的身上看到了在反对帝国主义压迫的斗争中的忠实朋友和强大的同盟者。
    社会主义在苏联的胜利、法西斯集团在第二次世界大战中的被粉碎、世界社会主义体系的产生和巩固，大大地削弱了帝国主义，为被压迫国家人民争取民族独立的胜利斗争创造了有利的条件。在建设社会主义的道路上，中华人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国取得了很大的成就。这对亚非各国人民的民族解放斗争的整个进程起了巨大的革命性的影响。
    印度、印度尼西亚、阿联、锡兰、缅甸、伊拉克和其他许多亚非国家已经摆脱了殖民主义者的政治统治。共有十四亿人口的许多国家从殖民主义的枷锁下解放出来了。但现在还有约一亿六千万人过着殖民地的生活。
    殖民主义在亚洲遭到了全面彻底的失败。因此，帝国主义就越发抓住非洲——自己剩下的殖民堡垒不放。一亿三千多万的非洲居民正在殖民主义的压迫下受折磨。非洲这个拥有神话般的自然财富而土著居民却一贫如洗的大洲的各国人民的觉醒，是我们时代最重要的现象之一。民族解放的清风现在也吹到了非洲大陆上空，在这个大陆上新的独立的国家——利比亚、突尼斯、摩洛哥、苏丹、加纳、几内亚一个接着一个地出现了。在最近的一两年中，根据联合国的决定，所谓托管地多哥和意大利的索马里兰也应当获得国家独立。尼日利亚、罗得西亚、尼亚萨兰也已被允许获得形式上的独立。阿尔及利亚人民为争取自己的自由和独立所进行的英勇斗争得到苏联人民和全体进步人类的完全同情。和支持。刚果人民已投入了反对比利时和美国殖民者的积极解放斗争。非洲各国人民要求真正民族自由的愿望在阿克拉会议上得到了显明的体现，阿克拉会议提出的口号是：“帝国主义者滚出非洲去！”，“这一代人要获得独立！”。
    民族独立国家还须清除一切殖民主义残余
    扩大民主和团结各阶层人民具有重大意义
    反对帝国主义的革命使许多国家的人民取得了民族独立，这是他们的最伟大的有历史性的成果。但是要解决经济、政治和社会问题需要的不只是民族独立，虽然它是独立发展的主要条件。
    东方各国要求消灭落后的愿望现在表现在国有化政策、发展民族工业、实行具有极其重要意义的土地改革、鼓励国营企业的政策上、表现在试图在经济中利用计划原则方面。但是许多国家的反动派依靠自己的特权，阻挠实行这些措施，甚至同帝国主义直接勾结和建立直接的同盟。
    东方各国人民不会不看到，由于内部尖锐的矛盾、冲突、竞争和危机而处于四分五裂的殖民国家，现在又联合它们的力量来对付民族解放运动了。大西洋公约不仅在欧洲具有侵略工具的意义，而且也是针对亚洲和非洲各国人民的，同样，巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织之类的侵略组织也是为了联合各资本主义国家垄断组织的力量以便在非洲和亚洲进行共同扩张。这就是现在所谓的“集体殖民主义”。
    东方各国人民建立了自己的阵线同帝国主义阵线相对抗。具有历史意义的万隆会议是这条道路上的重要里程碑。万隆会议显示了亚非国家在反对帝国主义斗争中的伟大团结。万隆会议的思想在开罗和塔什干会议上又得到了重申。这些思想之所以强而有力，是因为它反映了当前时代的精神和迫切的要求。阿拉伯人、非洲人和东方其他各国人民要求团结的愿望是为历史所证实是正当的，合乎规律的，苏联人民完全赞同他们这个正义愿望。但是像在东方有人指出的那样，只有能够更加广泛地开展清除一切殖民附属残余的斗争的团结才是符合各国人民利益的。反帝的内容就是这种团结的主要标准。如果这种团结是建立在善意的原则上并考虑到每一个民族的历史、经济和社会特点，建立在平等、尊重独立和主权的基础上的话，这种团结就可能收到成果。
    对于从殖民枷锁下解放出来的国家来说，尽力扩大民主，团结各阶层人民是具有特别重大的意义的。在这方面印度的发展是很有意义的。无疑，印度还需要做很多事情才能彻底消除殖民主义的后果，并保证社会和经济的进步。但也毫无疑问，由于东方杰出的国家活动家尼赫鲁总理和他所领导的政府执行有远见的政策，以及一切进步力量的活动，印度在短短的历史时期内，在发展工业、农业和整个经济方面，在保证民族的统一和提高印度的国际威望方面取得了大家知道的成就。
      但是在东方某些国家里，在赶走殖民主义者之后，目前有人企图收缩民主。大家知道，国家领导人和政府愈能团结群众，愈能在自己的全部活动中依靠人民，首先是依靠人民当中的先进部分，愈能全力扩大人民的民主权利，提高他们的生活水平，保证同兄弟人民的团结，也就是说，愈能实现各族人民的优秀儿女曾经奋斗、流血、牺牲而追求的一切，他们的威信便愈高。
    下面这种情况并不是偶然的：凡是出现反民主倾向的国家，美元或英镑或者二者一起就要前来帮忙，而帝国主义者便加紧在那里进行自己的政治阴谋和加紧宣传，用所谓“共产主义威胁”进行恫吓。帝国主义者的宣传锋芒首先指向共产党人，把他们说成是民族团结的敌人，指望以此来在亚非新兴国家当中制造分裂，离间这些国家的各阶层居民。但是谁不清楚，指责共产党人，说他们不为本民族利益服务的论调纯粹是诽谤。这种指责有利于帝国主义者，因而引起全体进步人士的合理愤慨。东方的共产党人也像所有国家的共产党人一样，是为人民事业、为人类幸福而奋斗的最坚定不移和始终如一的战士！（掌声）
    南斯拉夫修正主义者为了狭隘的民族主义利益和沙文主义利益而背叛无产阶级国际主义和国际团结的伟大原则，他们帮助帝国主义者在亚非国家搞颠复活动。修正主义者想迷惑东方各年轻共和国的一些政治领袖，想使他们不信任苏联的政策和其他社会主义国家的政策。修正主义者用自己的行动损害亚非各国人民的真正利益。
    苏联人民感到高兴的是，在国际会议上响彻了德里和开罗、仰光和巴格达、雅加达和阿克拉以及亚非其他主权国家首都的声音；如果不倾听它们的呼声，任何人都无法顺利地实现国际政策。世界上已经出现了一批国家，他们宣布以不参加帝国主义军事集团作为本国的政策，它们选择了著名的“潘查希拉”原则作为本国外交政策的基础。一个包括亚非许多国家的广阔的“和平地区”出现了，这得到苏联政府的完全支持。
    帝国主义者垂死挣扎妄图维持殖民体系
    把亚非国家拖进军事集团是主要的手法
    帝国主义国家为了防止殖民体系的完全毁灭正在作垂死挣扎。英国、法国、荷兰、比利时、葡萄牙在美国垄断组织的支持下千方百计地竭力维护自己的殖民帝国的残余，阻挠各国人民实现自决权，发动殖民战争，镇压各国人民对独立的合法要求。美帝国主义在所有这些方面扮演了特别不光采的角色。
    美国垄断资本家和战争狂人同其他帝国主义国家勾结在一起采用种种手段——策划阴谋、进行收买、挑衅、直接进行武装干涉、提供臭名远扬的“援助”等等，来对付那些不愿意追随美国政策的国家。最近全世界都看到了对黎巴嫩和约旦的武装干涉，在台湾海峡对中华人民共和国的挑衅，阴谋破坏国家统一的印度尼西亚反动集团的叛乱，在年轻的伊拉克共和国策划的一些阴谋以及对东方各国人民的许多其他颠复活动。
    帝国主义者力图把亚非国家拖入军事集团，并同它们缔结军事一政治协定，这是伪装的殖民主义的一个极重要的形式。现在，在东方，人们公正地说：“西方想强加给我们的集团是要使殖民主义在我们国家复辟，不过换了一种新的形式。帝国主义像变色蜥蜴一样，总是变换颜色，以便掩饰自己的本相”。臭名远扬的杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义破产了。现在美帝国主义者企图同伊朗、土耳其、巴基斯坦和其他一些国家缔结双边军事协定。
    现实生活确凿地表明，对任何一个与帝国主义国家有着军事义务联系的国家，这都没有带来，而且也不可能带来任何好处，相反地，使它们每个国家更深地陷入所谓援助的罗网中。各国人民不仅看不到自己生活的改善，而且越来越意识到这种政策对自己民族发展的危害。所以，这些国家的统治集团越是想和帝国主义加强联盟，他们就越在群众心目中成为不受欢迎的人，那是并非偶然的。
    伊拉克事件就是一个明证。这个国家曾被视为帝国主义在远东的堡垒，国内曾经存在的是野蛮的恐怖的统治。然而结果怎样呢？仅仅在一个半到两个小时内，在人民群众的冲击下，英国和美国帝国主义者们四十年来通过努里·赛义德及其走卒惨淡经营起来的东西，一下全垮台了。任何巴格达条约也帮助不了帝国主义者们防止他们的政策在近东遭到这种破产。某些邻国的反动分子得了“努里·赛义德病”：他们害怕人民的愤怒，勾结帝国主义，出卖本国的民族利益。
    美国及其他殖民国家的政策在东方的情况就是如此。这个政策的实质在于，使殖民奴役改头换面恢复起来，并永远保存下去。
    苏联把东方国家看成真正平等的朋友
    给予经济援助而从不干涉它们的内政
    苏维埃国家可以自豪的是：它在人类历史上第一个建立了没有任何自私打算的真正新型的国际关系。苏联同东方各国的相互关系是以共产党所提出的原则为基础的。东方各国人民的伟大的朋友弗·伊·列宁曾说过，苏维埃外交政策的基础将是：“同资产阶级文明世界的野蛮政策完全断绝关系，这种政策是奴役亚洲和一切殖民地弱小国家的数万万劳动人民，为少数特殊民族的剥削者谋福利的”。（列宁全集俄文本第二十六卷第三百八十六页）。
    最近五年来，我们和东方各国的关系发生了重大的变化。这表现为，苏联同亚非国家之间进一步加强了政治、经济和文化联系，苏联政府领导人同其他国家领导人建立了个人的接触。
    苏联扩大同东方各国的平等的经济关系，并给予它们越来越多的经济援助，同时并没有干涉他们的内政，而把他们看作真正平等的朋友。东方各国可以从苏联和其他社会主义国家获得他们所最迫切需要的机器设备。因此难怪苏联和东方各国的贸易和经济合作是这样迅速并且富有成效地发展起来。苏联同亚非和拉丁美洲各国之间的贸易总量从1953年到1957年增加了四倍多。1958年，苏联仅仅同三个东方国家有过经济协定，现在已经和十四个亚非国家有着经济协定。1955年初，苏联同亚非国家实行经济技术合作所承担的全部义务并不大，总共只有几千万卢布。现在，所给予的长期贷款总额为数十亿卢布。苏联的贷款极为优惠。这些贷款的利息很低，一般说来可以用本国货币或用这些国家通常用来出口的商品来偿还。苏维埃国家和所有社会主义国家执行这种政策，是出于帮助东方各国人民独立的经济发展的热烈希望。
    经济合作的特点是，苏联帮助他国建设企业，首先是重工业企业。我们同印度、阿联、阿富汗的相互关系可以作为明显的例子。苏联同也门、缅甸、印度尼西亚、锡兰、伊拉克、埃塞俄比亚以及柬埔寨等国家也有经济协定。
    我们帮助不发达国家的能力并不仅限于工业发展方面。苏联也能大力帮助解决农业发展中的迫切任务，建立现代化保健事业，培养国民经济的计划人才和其他许多方面的干部。
    苏联同经济不发达国家的友好关系，在维护这些国家的独立以防止帝国主义者的侵犯方面有很大的帮助。1956年英、法、以侵略埃及，1957年叙利亚受到政治威胁和军事挑衅的无耻的攻击的时候，以及1958年美英干涉黎巴嫩和约旦的时候，苏联每次都坚决支持阿拉伯人民的斗争。
    殖民主义必然会彻底失败，民族解放运动必将得到完全胜利，但是东方各族人民必须经常保持警惕，不要忘记帝国主义者的阴谋，他们决不会放弃重新恢复他们在亚非国家原有统治的企图。
    苏联和一切社会主义国家过去和将来都一直是东方各族人民的忠实朋友。苏联人自己就曾为克服世世代代的落后走过困难的道路，他们非常明白并且完全同情东方各族人民的愿望，并且像兄弟一般地衷心祝他们在建立新生活、争取完全的政治自由、民族独立、繁荣和幸福的艰巨事业中取得胜利。（掌声）
    同志们！我们祖国的二亿多公民，是一个被牢不可破的友谊共同观点和一致行动所团结起来的伟大家庭中的儿女。这是苏维埃国家力量的泉源，是共产主义胜利的保证！
    光荣归于我们亲爱的共产党——各族人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊的伟大创造者！（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）
