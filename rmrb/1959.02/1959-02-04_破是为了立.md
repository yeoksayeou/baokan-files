Demolition is for Construction
    Wu Lü
    Tianjin Third Construction Engineering Company has a valuable experience in organizing the mass movement of the all-round Great Leap Forward. This is to mobilize the masses to break down rules and regulations that do not meet the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical results, and to mobilize the masses to establish rules and regulations that promote the development of productive forces in a more, faster, better, and more economical manner. To demolish and to construct—this is a dialectical understanding and an important issue that we should pay attention to when leading mass movements.
    Demolition and construction are also a unity of opposites. No demolition, no construction; "if the old doesn't go, the new won't come"—this is one aspect. Demolition is for construction, therefore demolition must be followed by construction—this is the second and more important aspect. To establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie must be demolished; demolishing the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie is for establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat. To establish an overall concept, local viewpoints must be demolished; demolishing local viewpoints is for establishing an overall concept. The process of demolition and construction of things is a process of contradiction, struggle, and unity. Construction without demolition is impossible; demolition without construction is also unimaginable. We communists are believers in continuous revolution, and our attitude towards life is to demolish and construct, to demolish and construct on a large scale. Everything outdated and backward must be demolished on a large scale, and everything new and progressive must be established on a large scale.
    Modern enterprises are production units where hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of people are organized together to fight against nature. At any time, they need coordinated and consistent actions, and therefore, at any time, they need certain rules and regulations. "Without rules, nothing can be accomplished." Without certain rules and regulations, there will be no coordinated and consistent actions, and it will be difficult to win in the struggle for production. Some rules and regulations conform to the objective laws of people organizing together to fight against nature, promote the development of this struggle, and are therefore reasonable and necessary, and should not be demolished. Some rules and regulations do not conform to the objective laws of people organizing together to fight against nature, hinder the development of this struggle, and are therefore unreasonable and need to be demolished. If they are not demolished, they will hinder the development of production. But after demolition, there must be construction. It is not acceptable to leave a "vacuum." Old rules and regulations are lagging behind the development of production and need to be demolished; but after demolition, new rules and regulations must be formulated according to the needs of the development of productive forces. Without new rules and regulations that promote the development of productive forces, everyone will act in their own way, which will also hinder the development of production. This is the case with technological processes in production, and it is also the case with all aspects of planning management, technical management, and organizational management in enterprises, all of which require certain rules and regulations, and all of which require both demolition and construction.
    Some comrades have paid attention to the aspect that rules and regulations need to be demolished, but have not paid attention to the aspect that rules and regulations also need to be constructed, and even believe that mass movements can only demolish and cannot construct, and that establishing new rules and regulations will restrict the development of mass movements. This is also a kind of one-sidedness in work methods and thinking methods. In fact, mass movements always involve both demolition and construction. Only with demolition and construction can there be development of mass movements. Learning from advanced experiences, vigorously engaging in technological revolution, and replacing backward production technologies with advanced production technologies is a process of demolition and construction. Only when the masses have mastered advanced management methods and production technologies will the original management systems and technological processes appear backward and need to be demolished. Since the original management systems and technological processes should be demolished, it is always because better management systems and advanced production technologies have emerged. It can be seen that demolition and construction are always linked together.
    There must be construction after demolition, and demolition is for construction—this is our correct attitude towards rules and regulations.

    破是为了立
    吴滤
    天津市第三建筑工程公司在组织全面大跃进的群众运动中，有一条经验很值得注意。这就是既发动群众去破不符合多快好省要求的障碍生产发展的规章制度，又发动群众去立促进多快好省的发展生产力的规章制度。有破有立，这是一种辩证的认识，是我们在领导群众运动中应该注意的一个重要问题。
    破和立，也是对立的统一。不破不立，“旧的不去，新的不来”，这是一。破是为了立，因而有破必有立，这是二，也是主要的。要立无产阶级专政，必破资产阶级专政；破资产阶级专政是为了立无产阶级专政。要立整体观念，必破局部观点；破局部观点是为了立整体观念。事物的又破又立的过程，是矛盾斗争和统一的过程。不破而立，是不可能的；破而不立，也是不可想像的。我们共产党人是不断革命论者，我们对待生活的态度是又破又立，大破大立。一切陈旧了的，落后了的东西都要大破，一切新生的，进步的东西都要大立。
    近代企业是一个成百、成千、成万的人组织在一起同自然作斗争的生产单位，在任何时候都需要有协同一致的动作，因而在任何时候都需要一定的规章制度。“不以规矩不能成方圆”，没有一定的规章制度就没有协同一致的动作，就难以在生产斗争中得到胜利。有些规章制度符合于当前人们组织在一起同自然作斗争的客观规律，促进着这种斗争的发展，因而是合理的，必需的，是不应当破的。有些规章制度不符合于当前人们组织在一起同自然作斗争的客观规律，妨碍着这种斗争的发展，因而是不合理的，需要破。不破，就障碍着生产的发展。但破了之后，还要立。破而不立，留下一个“真空地带”是不行的。旧的规章制度落后于生产的发展，需要破；但破了之后总要根据生产力发展的需要制订新的规章制度。没有新的，促进生产力发展的规章制度，大家各行其是，同样障碍着生产的发展。生产中的工艺规程是如此，企业中计划管理、技术管理、组织管理的各个方面都是如此，都需要一定的规章制度，都要有破有立。
    有些同志注意了规章制度需要破的一面，而没有注意到规章制度还需要立的一面，甚至认为群众运动只能破、不能立，立了新的规章制度就束缚了群众运动的发展。这也是工作方法和思想方法上的一种片面性。其实，群众运动总是有破有立的。有破有立，才有群众运动的发展。学习先进经验，大搞技术革命，用先进的生产技术代替落后的生产技术，就是一个有破有立的过程。群众掌握了先进的管理方法和生产技术，相形之下，原来的管理制度和工艺规程才显得落后了，才需要破。既然原来的管理制度和工艺规程应该破，总是因为出现了更好的管理制度和先进的生产技术。可见，破和立总是连在一起的。
    有破必有立，破是为了立，这是我们对待规章制度的正确态度。
