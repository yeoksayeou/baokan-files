Semimonthly International Review
    ——From January 16th to 31st
    The Congress of Communist Builders
    The footsteps of historical giants are accelerating forward under the impetus of socialist forces. While the first artificial satellite is triumphantly singing the praises of socialism in distant space, people all over the world are now hearing from Moscow the powerful footsteps of the first socialist country embarking on the road to communism.
    The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which opened on January 27, is a congress of Soviet communist builders and a major event of world significance. Participating in the congress were more than 1,300 delegates from all over the Soviet Union and representatives of Marxist-Leninist parties from 70 countries. The holding of this congress marks the complete victory of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and marks the entry of the Soviet Union into a new historical period, that is, the period of comprehensively unfolding the construction of communist society. Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, pointed out at the meeting that the main tasks of this period are: to establish the material and technical basis of communism, to further consolidate the economic and defense forces of the Soviet Union, and at the same time to increasingly and fully meet the growing material and spiritual needs of the people. In fact, it is to solve such a historical task - to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product output.
    The control figures for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union in 1959-1965, which are being discussed at the 21st Congress of the CPSU, are an important component of the grand program of the Soviet Union to build communism. The plan stipulates that the Soviet Union will further develop the entire national economy on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, develop industry on the basis of the latest science and technology, develop agriculture on the basis of overall mechanization and electrification, and continuously increase the people's welfare on the basis of developing production and increasing labor productivity. At the same time, it will further improve the communist consciousness of the broad masses of the people, further develop national education in accordance with the principle of linking education with life, and further cultivate new communist people who can consciously abide by the rules of public life, master scientific knowledge, and develop physically and mentally in an all-round way.
    The fundamental problem of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan is to win time to the maximum extent and strive for high-speed progress. The plan stipulates that in the next seven years, the Soviet Union's total industrial output value will increase by 80%, which is equal to the total increase in the country's industry in the past 20 years. In agriculture, the total output value will increase by 70% in seven years. During the Seven-Year Plan period, the total amount of national capital construction investment will be approximately equal to the total investment in the entire Soviet era, and the national income will increase by 62% to 65%. In terms of people's lives, the actual income of workers and peasants will increase by about 40%. In seven years, nearly two-fifths of the country's residents will move into 15 million new homes with modern equipment. The working day of the working people will be shortened, and the intensity of labor will be greatly reduced. The figures of the Seven-Year Plan outline the contours of the communist prospects and predict a happier and better future for the Soviet people. The realization of this plan will lay a solid foundation in terms of material and spiritual conditions for the Soviet Union's transition to communism.
    The Soviet Seven-Year Plan is an extremely important stage in the economic competition between socialism and capitalism. The completion of the Seven-Year Plan will take a decisive step in realizing the basic economic task of the Soviet Union - surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product output. Although the current production volume of the Soviet Union is still lower than that of the United States, what is more important is the speed of production development. The socialist system guarantees the rapid and continuous rise of Soviet industrial and agricultural production, while the insurmountable contradictions of the capitalist system make the US economy only able to make slow progress, and even inevitably stagnate and decline. In the next seven years, the average annual growth rate of Soviet industrial and agricultural production will reach about 8%, while the expected growth rate of US production will not exceed 2% per year. The high-speed development of the Soviet economy makes it possible for it to surpass the United States in terms of per capita production level after about five years after the completion of the Seven-Year Plan. Due to the rapid economic development of China and other socialist countries during this period, the total output of the socialist camp will account for more than half of the world's total output by then. That is to say, in the peaceful economic competition between the two systems, the prospect of the socialist system achieving a decisive victory is already in sight.
    The Soviet Seven-Year Plan has extremely important international significance. People all over the world see their tomorrow from the Soviet Union's today and are inspired and confident by the Soviet people's achievements of great historical significance. Since the Seven-Year Plan itself contains many theoretical and practical issues related to the comprehensive development of communist construction, their elucidation and resolution will further enrich the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism and set an example and provide experience for the people of other countries to transition to communism in the future. The Soviet Union's economic power and peaceful purpose displayed by the Seven-Year Plan make it a powerful factor in defending peace. This is also a great support for the struggle of people all over the world for peace, democracy, freedom and happiness.
    The 21st Congress of the CPSU has aroused widespread attention and response internationally. The countries of the socialist camp and progressive people all over the world are rejoicing and inspired by the great victory of the Soviet Union's march towards communism, by the unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the unity of the Soviet Party and people, and the great unity of the international communist movement. Even some Western bourgeois public opinion has to admit that this congress is a congress of peace, unity, strength, optimism and full of confidence. They believe that the Soviet Union's "declared 80% increase in production in the next seven years is absolutely possible," "the Soviet economic plan is to prevent war," and "with all the achievements Moscow has made, the self-proclaimed free world (the West) pales in comparison." According to the United Press International report, due to the disparity in the rate of economic development, US officials have helplessly admitted that the Soviet Union "may eventually surpass the United States in terms of total output."

    Storm Clouds Gathering in Latin America
    The situation in Cuba in the past half-month remains one of the centers of attention. After achieving the great victory of overthrowing the Batista dictatorial regime, the Cuban people have launched an unprecedentedly turbulent and resolute struggle against US interference in Cuba's internal affairs. On January 21, one million people in Havana held a large-scale demonstration, resolutely safeguarding their right to punish Batista's criminals and opposing the barbaric interference of the US imperialists.
    It is no accident that the US imperialists have launched a crusade to save the lives of Batista's criminals and openly interfere in Cuba's internal affairs on the issue of the Cuban Provisional Government's punishment of Batista's criminals. As everyone knows, the Batista dictatorial regime was fostered by the United States. The collapse of this dictatorial regime means that the political forces of the United States in Cuba have suffered the heaviest blow. However, at the beginning of the establishment of the Cuban Provisional Government, the United States still pretended to be calm, and the US bourgeois newspapers even revealed the illusion that US forces could infiltrate the Cuban Provisional Government. Therefore, the United States put on the mask of "non-interference" in an attempt to paralyze the Cuban people. However, the facts went in the opposite direction of the US imperialists' illusions. The Cuban Provisional Government, under the requirements and support of the Cuban people, implemented and prepared to implement a series of political, economic and social reforms, especially resolutely suppressing Batista's criminals in a swift and decisive manner. Moreover, as Cuban revolutionary leader Castro pointed out, the US imperialists found that no one within the Cuban Provisional Government could be bribed or bought by them. Therefore, in order to prevent their lackeys in Cuba from being eradicated and to obstruct the Cuban Provisional Government from carrying out political, economic and social reforms, the US imperialists hid behind the golden signboard of "humanitarianism" and opened fire on the Cuban Provisional Government, exerting barbaric pressure, clamoring to "sanction" Cuba, and attempting to force the Cuban Provisional Government to submit to the will of the United States.
    However, the Cuban people who have stood up have given the US imperialists' conspiracy a merciless exposure and a resolute rebuff. Castro, on behalf of the Cuban people, issued the heroic oath that "Cuba not only demands political freedom, but also demands economic freedom." The large-scale demonstration of one million people in Havana pushed the Cuban national democratic revolution to a new climax.
    The great impact of the Cuban people's victory on the countries of Latin America has been demonstrated by new facts in the past half-month.
    News came that in Paraguay and Dominica, two countries ruled by dictators fostered by the United States, the people's struggle against the dictatorship has greatly increased, and the dictators are stepping up their repression to maintain their tottering regimes.
    On January 21, the Panamanian government officially rejected the US government's "protest" against Panama's extension of its territorial sea to twelve nautical miles. The fact that a country like Panama, which was created by the United States (forcibly separated from Colombia) with a population of less than one million, now dares to reject the US "protest" fully demonstrates today's political climate in Latin America.
    In order to oppose the transfer of the state-owned slaughterhouse and cold storage plant to US monopoly capital for operation, 6,000 workers in the Argentine slaughterhouse and cold storage plant held a strike on January 15 under the slogan "Don't agree to give it to the Americans." On the 17th and 18th, 94 trade unions of the two major trade union systems in Argentina successively announced a nationwide general strike to express their support and oppose the Argentine government's pro-US economic policy. On January 17, 5,000 railway workers in Guatemala held a strike to oppose the exploitation of the US railway company. Although these strikes have all been suppressed, the anti-US sentiment rippling in these strikes will converge into a torrent, impacting the US economic rule in Latin America.
    All this shows that the anti-American wind is roaring on the continent of Latin America. "The mountain rain is about to come and the wind is filling the building." Cuba has already sounded a thunder, and the day when the storm will come to the entire Latin America is not far away.
    The Fire of the African People is Burning
    The Congolese people's struggle against colonial rule has lasted for nearly a month. The bloody suppression and deceptive tactics of the Belgian colonialists cannot quell the flames of the Congolese people's movement for national independence. Now, not only has the capital, Leopoldville, not calmed down, but in Stanleyville, Matadi port and other places, people's demonstrations have sprung up one after another. The African residents of Leopoldville even broke through the colonialists' curfew, built street barricades with branches, old furniture, straw mats, etc. on the streets, and attacked the colonialists' armed patrols with stones and metal fragments. Although the Belgian colonialists arrested 19 leaders of the Congolese patriotic organization "Abako" Association, members of the "Abako" Association still organized people to carry out struggles and issued brochures demanding immediate independence from Belgium and the release of the leaders of the "Abako" organization. The Congolese people are using various forms to fight against the colonialists. They sing heroically: "Congo, the land of our ancestors, we will fight for your freedom, even if blood flows like a river."
    The Congolese people's struggle for national independence is inspiring the anti-colonialist struggles of the people in vast areas of Africa. At the same time, it is also actively supported by 200 million African people. The entire African continent, from south to north, from east to west, resounds with calls for "independence" and "freedom." In Central Africa, the Africans in Nyasaland held mass rallies and parades on January 20 against colonial rule, regardless of police suppression. A mass meeting was held in Salisbury, the industrial center of Southern Rhodesia. At the meeting, Chikerema, vice chairman of the African National Congress, said that if a violent revolution occurs in Central Africa, it will start from Southern Rhodesia first. In East Africa, the people of Tanganyika presented an ultimatum to the Queen of England and the Governor of Tanganyika, demanding independence in 1959, otherwise they would carry out resolute resistance. The Buganda Legislative Council recently passed a resolution demanding an early end to the status of British "protectorate." In Mozambique under Portuguese terrorist rule, leaflets criticizing the colonial authorities' colonial policies have also appeared. Even in Cape Town, South Africa, where the policy of racial discrimination is most severe, a mass rally was held on January 27 to protest the South African government's deprivation of the right to vote in municipal elections for colored people in Cape Town. In the region where armed struggle is fierce, the heroic Algerian National Liberation Army recently broke through the French so-called "Maurice Line" and achieved brilliant victories. The armed struggle of the Cameroonian people is also continuing to develop, and the struggle of the people of French Togoland has also developed vigorously recently. The flames of the national independence movement have spread rapidly from North Africa to West Africa, Central Africa and East Africa, and even South Africa. The so-called "last line of defense" of imperialism has been further fragmented. The African people who have been subjected to slavery and oppression for a long time are rising up one after another to break the chains of colonialism.
    Faced with the surging national liberation movement, the imperialists cannot help but panic. They are trying to maintain their colonial positions and are currently making a dying struggle. From the day the Congolese people broke out in the anti-colonialist struggle, the Belgian colonial authorities mobilized a large number of military police and carried out bloody massacres and arrests of the Congolese people.
    After the outbreak of the Congolese people's struggle, French motorized troops also set out from Cotonou (the capital of Dahomey), crossed the border, and drove to Lome, the capital of Togo, in an attempt to suppress the national independence struggle of the Togolese people. The Portuguese colonial authorities also carried out large-scale searches and arrests in Mozambique. In particular, the upsurge of the national independence movement in British East Africa has forced the British colonial authorities to hurriedly convene the governors of British-驻 Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar in London to discuss the situation in East Africa and Britain's countermeasures.
    It is worth noting that while Western colonial countries are intensifying bloody suppression and terrorist rule over the African people, they are also being forced to change their strategies in order to deceive the African people with false "independence." While the "New York Times" exclaimed that the African national liberation movement was unstoppable, it proposed that Western colonialists make the African people's struggle "restrained and moderate" and advocated "granting independence without causing unfortunate effects to the parties concerned." However, neither fire and sword can overwhelm the African people, nor can deception and appeasement shake the revolutionary will of the African people. Once the fire of the African people's anti-colonialism is ignited, it will burn fiercely until the complete burial of the colonial system.

    半月国际述评
    ——从1月16日到31日
    共产主义建设者的代表大会
    历史巨人的步伐正在社会主义力量的推动下加速向前迈进。当第一个人造行星正在遥远的太空高奏社会主义凯歌的时候，全世界人民现在又从莫斯科听到了第一个社会主义国家开始迈向共产主义的强大足音。
    1月27日开幕的苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会，是苏联共产主义建设者的代表大会，是具有世界意义的一件大事。参加大会的，有来自苏联各地的一千三百多名代表和来自七十个国家的马克思列宁主义政党的代表。这次大会的举行，标志着苏联社会主义建设的彻底胜利，标志着苏联已进入了一个新的历史时期，也就是全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期。苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫同志在会上指出：这个时期的主要任务是：建立共产主义的物质技术基础，进一步巩固苏联的经济力量和国防力量，同时日益充分地满足人民不断增长的物质和精神需要。实际上，也就是要解决这样一个历史任务——在按人口平均计算的产品产量方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    正在苏共第二十一次代表大会上讨论的1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的控制数字是苏联建设共产主义宏伟纲领的重要组成部分。这个计划规定，苏联将在优先发展重工业的基础上进一步发展整个国民经济，在最新科学和技术基础上发展工业，在全盘机械化和电气化的基础上发展农业，在发展生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上不断增加人民的福利。同时，还将进一步提高广大人民群众的共产主义觉悟，进一步按照教育和生活联系的原则发展国民教育，进一步培养能够自觉遵守公共生活规则、掌握科学知识、身心全面发展的共产主义新人。
    苏联七年计划的根本问题是最大限度地赢得时间，是力争高速度地前进。计划规定，在今后七年内，苏联的工业总产值将要增加80％，也就是等于最近二十年来苏联全国工业的增产总值。在农业方面，七年内的总产值将要增加70％。在七年计划期间，国家基本建设投资总额将大约等于苏维埃政权整个年代中投资的总和，国民收入将增加62％到65％。在人民生活方面，职工和农民的实际收入都将增加40％左右。七年内，全国近五分之二的居民将迁入一千五百万套具有现代化设备的新居。劳动人民的工作日将要缩短，劳动强度也将大大减轻。七年计划的数字，勾画出了共产主义远景的轮廓，预示着苏联人民更加幸福美好的未来。这个计划的实现，将在物质条件和精神条件方面为苏联过渡到共产主义建立巩固的基础。
    苏联七年计划是社会主义和资本主义经济竞赛中的一个极重要的阶段。七年计划的完成，将在实现苏联基本经济任务——按人口平均计算的产品产量上赶过最发达的资本主义国家方面——迈出决定性的一步。尽管苏联目前的生产量还低于美国，但更重要的是生产发展的速度。社会主义制度保证了苏联工农业生产一往直前的迅速高涨，而资本主义制度所不可克服的矛盾却使美国经济只能有缓慢的进展，甚至还免不了停滞和衰退。在今后七年内，苏联工农业生产的每年平均增长速度达到8％左右，而预料美国每年产量的增长率不会超过2％。苏联经济的高速度发展，使它有可能在完成七年计划以后，再经过大约五年的时间，在按人口平均计算的生产水平方面超过美国。由于在此期间中国和其他社会主义国家经济的飞速发展，到那时社会主义阵营的总产量将占世界总产量的一半以上。也就是说，在两个制度的和平经济竞赛中，社会主义制度取得决定性胜利的前途已经在望了。
    苏联七年计划有着极其重大的国际意义。全世界人民都从苏联的今天看到了自己的明天，从苏联人民具有伟大历史意义的成就中得到了鼓舞和信心。由于七年计划本身包含着许多有关全面开展共产主义建设的理论和实践问题，它们的阐明和解决，必将进一步丰富马克思列宁主义的宝库，给其他各国人民今后向共产主义过渡树立榜样和提供经验。七年计划所显示的苏联经济威力和和平目的，使它成为保卫和平的一个强大因素。这对于世界各国人民争取和平民主、自由和幸福的斗争，也是一个极大的支持。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会在国际上已经引起了广泛的注意和反应。社会主义阵营各国和全世界进步人士，都为苏联向共产主义迈进的伟大胜利，为苏联共产党的团结，苏联党和人民的团结，以及国际共产主义运动的伟大团结而欢欣鼓舞。即使某些西方资产阶级舆论也不得不承认这次代表大会是一个和平、团结、强大、乐观和充满信心的大会。他们认为：苏联“所宣布的在今后七年中生产增长80％是绝对可能的”，“苏联的经济计划是要防止战争”，“随着莫斯科取得的一切成就，自称为自由的世界（西方）便相形见拙”。据合众国际社报道：由于经济发展速度对比的悬殊，美国官方人士已无可奈何地承认，苏联“最后在总产量方面可能超过美国”。
    山雨欲来的拉丁美洲
    这半月的古巴局势，依然是人们的注意中心之一。古巴人民继取得了推翻巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的伟大胜利之后，又展开了空前汹涌的反对美国干涉古巴内政的坚决斗争。1月21日，哈瓦那一百万群众大示威，坚决维护自己的惩治巴蒂斯塔犯罪分子的权利，反对美帝国主义者的横蛮干涉。
    美帝国主义者在古巴临时政府惩治巴蒂斯塔犯罪分子的问题上，掀起了一个拯救巴蒂斯塔犯罪分子的生命的十字军运动，公然干涉古巴的内政，并不是偶然的。大家知道，巴蒂斯塔独裁政权是美国一手抚育起来的，这个独裁政权的垮台就意味着美国在古巴的政治势力遭受到最沉重的打击。但是，在古巴临时政府成立之初，美国还强作镇静，美国资产阶级报刊上并且流露了关于美国的势力可以渗入古巴临时政府的幻想。因此，美国戴上了“不干涉者”的面具，企图麻痹古巴人民。然而，事实走向了美帝国主义者的幻想的反面。古巴临时政府在古巴人民的要求和支持下，执行了和准备执行一系列政治、经济和社会改革，特别是雷厉风行地对巴蒂斯塔犯罪分子实行坚决镇压。并且，正如古巴革命领导人卡斯特罗所指出的，美帝国主义者发现古巴临时政府内部没有一个人可以被他们贿赂或收买。于是，为了使他们在古巴的走狗不被斩草除根，为了阻挠古巴临时政府进行政治、经济和社会改革，美帝国主义者躲在“人道主义”的金字招牌后面，向古巴临时政府开火，施加横蛮的压力，叫嚣要“制裁”古巴，企图压迫古巴临时政府屈从美国的意志。
    但是，站起来了的古巴人民对美帝国主义的阴谋给予无情的揭露和坚决的回击。卡斯特罗代表古巴人民发出了“古巴不但要求政治上的自由，而且也要求经济上的自由”这一豪迈的誓言。哈瓦那百万人民的大示威，把古巴人民的民族民主革命推向了新的高涨。
    古巴人民的胜利对拉丁美洲各国的巨大影响，在这半月中得到了新的事实证明。
    消息传来，在巴拉圭和多米尼加这两个为美国抚育的独裁者所统治的国家内，人民反独裁的斗争大大增强，独裁者正加紧实行镇压以维持其摇摇欲坠的政权。
    巴拿马政府于1月21日正式拒绝了美国政府对巴拿马延伸领海范围为十二海里的“抗议”。像巴拿马这样一个由美国一手制造出来的（硬从哥伦比亚分离的），人口不到一百万的国家，现在也敢于拒绝美国的“抗议”，这就充分表明了今天拉丁美洲的政治气候。
    为了反对把国营屠宰冷藏厂交给美国垄断资本去经营，阿根廷的屠宰冷藏厂六千名工人于1月15日在“不答应给美国佬”的口号下举行罢工。17日和18日，阿根廷两大工会系统的九十四个工会相继宣布举行全国规模的总罢工表示支援，并反对阿根廷政府的亲美经济政策。危地马拉的五千名铁路工人于1月17日举行罢工，反对美国铁路公司的剥削。这些罢工虽然都已经被镇压下去，但是，荡漾在这些罢工中的反美情绪却将汇成一股激流，冲击着美国在拉丁美洲的经济统治。
    这一切说明了，反美之风正在拉丁美洲的大陆上呼啸着。“山雨欲来风满楼”，古巴已发出了响雷，暴风雨降临整个拉丁美洲的日子不远了。
  非洲人民的怒火在燃烧
    刚果人民反对殖民统治的斗争，已经持续了将近一个月。比利时殖民者的血腥镇压和欺骗手段平息不了刚果人民争取民族独立运动的烈火，现在不仅首府利奥波德维尔没有平静下来，而且在斯坦利维尔、马塔迪港口等地，人民示威行动此伏彼起。利奥波德维尔的非洲居民甚至冲破殖民者的宵禁，用树枝、旧家具、草席等在街道上筑成街垒，并且用石头和金属碎片袭击殖民者的武装巡逻队。尽管比利时殖民者逮捕了刚果爱国组织“阿巴科”协会的十九个领袖，但是，“阿巴科”协会的成员仍然组织人民进行斗争，并且印发小册子，要求立即脱离比利时而独立和释放“阿巴科”组织的领袖。刚果人民利用各种形式同殖民主义者进行着斗争，他们豪迈地唱着：“刚果哟，我们祖先的国土，我们将为你的自由而斗争，即使血流成河也要斗争。”
    刚果人民争取民族独立的斗争，鼓舞着非洲广大地区人民的反殖民主义斗争，同时，它也得到二亿非洲人民的积极支持。整个非洲大陆从南到北，从东到西响彻着要求“独立”和“自由”的呼声。在中非，尼亚萨兰的非洲人不顾警察的弹压，在1月20日举行了反对殖民统治的群众集会和游行。南罗得西亚的工业中心索耳兹伯里举行了群众大会，非洲人国民大会副主席契克雷马在大会上说，如果中非洲发生暴力革命，将首先从南罗得西亚开始。在东非，坦噶尼喀人民向英国女王和坦噶尼喀总督提出了最后通牒，要求在1959年取得独立，否则他们将进行坚决的反抗。布干达立法议会最近通过了一项决议，要求迅速结束英国“保护国”的地位。在葡萄牙恐怖统治下的莫三鼻给，也出现了抨击殖民当局的殖民政策的传单。甚至在执行种族歧视政策最厉害的南非联邦开普敦市，在1月27日也举行了抗议南非联邦政府剥夺开普敦有色人市政选举权的群众性集会。在武装斗争炽烈的地区，英勇的阿尔及利亚民族解放军最近突破了法国的所谓“莫里斯防线”，取得了辉煌的胜利。喀麦隆人民的武装斗争也在继续发展，法属多哥人民的斗争最近也有蓬勃的发展。民族独立运动的火焰已从北非迅速蔓延到西非、中非和东非，甚至南非，帝国主义的所谓“最后防线”已经进一步支离破碎了。长期遭受奴役和压迫的非洲人民正在前仆后继地起来打碎殖民主义的锁链。
    面对着风起云涌的民族解放运动，帝国主义者不禁惊慌失措。他们力图保住自己的殖民阵地，目前正在作垂死的挣扎。从刚果人民爆发反殖民主义斗争的那天开始，比利时殖民当局就调集了大批军警，对刚果人民进行了血腥屠杀和逮捕。
    在刚果人民的斗争爆发后，法国摩托化部队也由科托努（达荷美的首府）出动，越过边境，开往多哥的首府洛美，企图镇压多哥人民的民族独立斗争。葡萄牙殖民当局也在莫三鼻给大肆搜索和逮捕。特别是英属东非民族独立运动的高涨，迫使英国殖民当局匆匆忙忙地召集英国驻怯尼亚、乌干达、坦噶尼喀和桑给巴尔的总督在伦敦开会，讨论东非形势和英国的对策。
    值得注意的是，西方殖民国家一面对非洲人民加紧进行血腥镇压和恐怖统治，但同时正在被迫改变策略，以虚假的“独立”来欺骗非洲人民。“纽约时报”在惊呼非洲民族解放运动势不可挡的同时就提出要西方殖民者使非洲人民的斗争“有节制和有适度”，并且主张“赋予独立而不致使有关方面遭到不幸影响”。但是，火和剑既压不倒非洲人民，欺骗和怀柔也不会动摇非洲人民的革命斗志，非洲人民反殖民主义的怒火一经燃烧起来，就将熊熊不息，直到殖民制度的彻底埋葬。
