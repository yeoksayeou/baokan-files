Xinhua News Agency, February 25th, Tokyo Dispatch: Approximately four million Japanese workers belonging to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and neutral unions simultaneously launched a massive spring struggle today across the country.

    The Japan Federation of Steel Industry Workers' Unions launched a 24-hour strike; the Coal Miners' Union launched a timed strike; and unions in other private enterprises and government and public utility organizations also launched timed strikes and workplace rallies simultaneously across the country. Japan's steel, coal, chemical industries, and public utilities such as railways and postal services were partially paralyzed today.

    In this spring struggle, in addition to demanding higher wages, implementing a minimum wage system of 8,000 yen, and opposing illegal punishment of workers, Japanese workers also raised political slogans such as demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations and strive for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

    Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, stated today that Japanese workers will stand at the forefront of all levels of the Japanese people and launch a long-term struggle to open Sino-Japanese relations and strive for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

    Iwai pointed out that the Federation of Steel Industry Workers' Unions and the Coal Miners' Union stood at the forefront of this unified action, which greatly encouraged all workers. Iwai firmly stated that Japanese workers will not give up until the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is overthrown.

Xinhua News Agency, February 25th, Tokyo Dispatch: According to a report in "Akahata" today, representatives from all walks of life in Fukuoka Prefecture, totaling approximately 40,000 people, held a "General Uprising Rally for the Spring Struggle" in Omuta City on the 22nd.

    The conference unanimously passed a resolution, firmly stating that participants will strengthen the struggle to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and strive for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the process of launching the spring struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, February 24th, Tokyo Dispatch: Teachers' unions in various regions of Japan are waging a struggle to refuse to submit the 1958 "Performance Evaluation Report" to the education authorities.

    Six hundred principals participating in the Kochi Prefecture Teachers' Union held a special general meeting on the 23rd and decided to resolutely refuse to submit the "Performance Evaluation Report." The Kishi Nobusuke government's education authorities had ordered teachers in Kochi Prefecture to submit the 1958 "Performance Evaluation Report" by the end of February. The principals of junior and senior high schools in Kochi Prefecture have decided to return this reactionary instruction from the Kishi Nobusuke government.

    The Osaka City Teachers' Union held a standing executive committee meeting on the 23rd and decided that the principals of 855 junior and senior high schools in Osaka should immediately take action against the "Performance Evaluation" system, and strive to ensure that all schools in Osaka City refuse to submit the "Performance Evaluation Report" by February 28th.

    The Kyoto City Teachers' Union has decided to conduct a struggle against the "Performance Evaluation" system on February 25th and 26th. Junior high school teachers in Kyoto City will refuse to be on duty indefinitely starting from February 28th. (Attached picture)

    On February 14th, four million Japanese workers held rallies across the country to launch a spring struggle against unemployment and against war. The picture shows 20,000 workers holding a demonstration rally in Yotsuya Sotobori Park in Tokyo.
