Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th. The Soviet basketball team, the 1959 world men's basketball champion, returned victoriously to Moscow on the 6th from Santiago, the capital of Chile, after the Third World Men's Basketball Championship.

Team leader Valdmanis said at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport that the Soviet team defeated the American basketball team, which had won Olympic and world championships more than once, in this World Championship, and defeated the Brazilian team, which won the so-called "championship" in this tournament, twice. The Soviet team is the strongest team.

Valdmanis said that the International Amateur Basketball Federation had unreasonably deprived the Soviet team of the gold medal it deserved for the world championship, but the fact that the Soviet team is in fact the champion cannot be denied by anyone. Valdmanis then said that the Soviet team refused to play against the "Taiwan basketball team" which does not represent anyone, and this had been clearly stated as early as half a year ago. The decision of the International Basketball Federation can only prove that the leadership of this organization is arrogant and unreasonable.

    在世界篮球赛中屡战屡捷
    苏联篮球队凯旋归国
    新华社莫斯科7日电　1959年世界男子篮球冠军苏联篮球队在第三届世界男子篮球锦标赛结束后已于6日从智利首都圣地亚哥胜利返回莫斯科。
    领队瓦尔德马尼斯在莫斯科伏
    努科夫机场说，苏联队在这次世界锦标赛中击败了不只一次获得奥运会冠军和世界冠军的美国篮球队，
  并两次战胜了在这次锦标赛中取得所谓“冠军”的巴西队。苏联队是最强的球队。
    瓦尔德马尼斯说，国际业余篮球联合会无理地剥夺了苏联球队所应得的世界冠军的金质奖章，但是苏联队实际上是冠军这一事实是任何人所不能抹煞的。瓦尔德马尼斯接着说，苏联队拒绝了和不代表任何人的“台湾篮球队”比赛，关于这一点早在半年之前就已经明确地声明过了。国际篮联的决定只能证明这个机构的领导是蛮横无理的。
