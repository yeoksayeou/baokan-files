    Solidly Consolidate Literacy Achievements
    Jiangyin County Masses Arrange Time According to Busy and Leisurely Schedules to Persist in Studying Culture
    (Our Dispatch) Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, for more than half a year, has persisted in organizing the masses to study amidst tense and heavy production tasks, consolidating and expanding the achievements of the crash literacy campaign. After Jiangyin County basically eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in June last year, it immediately organized the newly literate students into more than 5,000 cultural study classes and transitioned to regular study. Except for particularly urgent tasks, the masses in the county can achieve intensive study during less busy times and extensive study during busy times, studying every day. Usually, they use two hours every night for study. For example, the water conservancy army of Nansha Commune studies for one hour after lunch before going to work. The masses say, "If mountain songs are not sung, they will be forgotten; if roads are not walked, they will be overgrown with grass; if sharp knives are not sharpened, they will rust; if you learn but don't practice, you will have wasted your effort." Many people, after working for a day, still think about how to explain and write certain characters before going to sleep. The content and form of cultural learning for the masses in this county are closely integrated with current production tasks, which not only does not hinder production but also promotes it. Many units with good cultural learning are also red flag units in production. The teaching materials include those compiled and distributed by the county and those compiled by the commune or production team in conjunction with current production tasks. Last summer, the rice fields of Ligang Commune needed to be treated for diseases and pests, so they compiled a lesson like this: "The rice in our commune is growing vigorously, with thick and strong stalks, black and shiny. Recently, withered and scorched rice leaves and stalks have been found in some fields. This is a disease, commonly called 'fire blight'..." It also described the harm of this disease and the methods of preparing and spraying medicine. In class, the teacher first reads the text, explains it, points out new characters and words, and then leads the reading. Classroom assignments include sentence construction and answering questions, such as answering what medicine to use to treat "fire blight," how to prepare it, and how to spray it, etc. The students not only learned culture but also cured the disease.
    The Party committees at all levels in this county attach great importance to the cultural learning of the masses. The county party committee frequently organizes the masses to check and compare. Where the learning is good and the consolidation work is effective, on-site meetings are held and visits are organized. Where there are many learning problems and the consolidation work is ineffective, inspections are carried out to help solve difficulties. During various production inspections, cultural learning is also included as one of the inspection contents. The county party secretary often emphasizes at various meetings that cultural learning should be carried out well while completing production tasks to consolidate the achievements of literacy. The township party committees also attach great importance to grasping cultural learning. In order to increase the quantity and quality of teachers, each commune adopted methods such as centralized training, spare-time advanced studies, apprenticeship, and collective lesson preparation to train more than 12,000 full-time and part-time mass teachers, greatly strengthening the leadership in cultural and educational work.
    Recently, in order to more accurately understand the achievements of literacy work, the county conducted a major cultural census, and learned that about 70% of the students' learning achievements have been consolidated and have reached the Chinese language level of higher primary school or junior primary school. Many people, after nearly half a year of study, can read newspapers, write letters, keep records, make production plans, and write jingles. Now, the whole county is actively taking measures to conduct another literacy remedial class, to solidly consolidate the achievements of literacy, in order to popularize junior primary and senior primary education.

    扎扎实实地巩固扫盲成果
    江阴县群众根据忙闲不同安排时间坚持学文化
    本报讯　江苏江阴县半年多来在生产任务紧张繁重的情况下，坚持不懈地组织群众学习，巩固和扩大了突击扫盲所取得的成绩。去年6月，江阴县基本上扫除了青壮年文盲以后，立即把刚摘掉文盲帽子的学员组织到五千多个文化学习班里，转入经常性的学习。除了特殊紧急的任务以外，全县群众都能做到大忙小学，小忙大学，每日必学。平时，他们利用每天晚上时间学习两小时。如南沙公社的水利大军，每天午饭后学习一小时再上工。群众说：“山歌不唱忘记多，大路不走草成窝，快刀不磨要生锈，学了不练白吃苦”。很多人劳动了一天以后，睡觉时还想着什么字怎样解释、怎样写。这个县群众文化学习的内容和形式，都和当前的生产任务紧紧结合起来，不仅不妨碍生产，而且还推动生产。许多文化学习好的单位，同时又是生产得红旗的单位。学习的教材有县里编发的，也有公社或生产队结合当前生产任务编写的。去年夏天，利港公社的稻田要治病害，于是就编了这样一课书：“我社水稻生长旺盛，稻秆粗壮，黑油油的。最近，在部分田里发现稻叶和稻秆枯焦，这是一种病，平常叫它‘火烧瘟’……”还写了这种病的危害、配药喷治的方法。上课时，教师先读课文、讲解、提出生字、新词，然后领读。课堂作业有造句和问答，如回答治“火烧瘟”要用什么药、怎样制、怎样喷射等等。学员不仅学了文化，而且治好了病害。
    这个县的各级党委都很重视群众文化学习。县委经常组织群众检查评比，哪儿的学习好，巩固工作效果大，就在哪儿开现场会，组织参观；哪儿学习问题多，巩固工作效果差，就到哪儿去检查，帮助解决困难。在组织各种生产大检查时，文化学习也列为检查内容之一，县委书记在各种会议上，经常强调要在完成生产任务的同时，搞好文化学习，巩固扫盲成果。各乡党委也很重视抓文化学习。为了提高教师的数量和质量，各公社采用集训、业余进修、带徒弟、集体备课等方式，培养了一万二千多名专职和兼职的群众教师，大大加强了文教工作的领导力量。
    最近，为了更准确地了解扫盲工作成绩，全县进行了一次文化大普查，了解到有70％左右学员学习成绩已经巩固，具备了高小或初小的语文水平。很多人经过近半年来的学习，已能看报、写信、做记录、订生产计划、写顺口溜等。现在，全县正积极采取措施，再进行一次扫盲补课，把扫盲成绩扎扎实实巩固下来，以便普及初小和高小教育。
