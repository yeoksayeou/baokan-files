The Soviet Communist Party's 21st Extraordinary Congress, which has drawn worldwide attention, successfully concluded on February 5th. The significance of this congress extends far beyond the borders of the Soviet Union. It not only points out the path to a happy communist society for progressive humanity around the world, but also presents a brilliant prospect for safeguarding lasting world peace for all peace-loving people.

The Seven-Year Plan adopted by the 21st Congress of the CPSU is both a plan for the comprehensive construction of a communist society and a crucial plan for peaceful economic competition between socialism and capitalism. Comrade Khrushchev said in his concluding remarks at the congress: "We hope to engage in peaceful competition with capitalist countries, and we hope to compete in developing productive forces, tapping the economic potential of the country, and improving the material and cultural welfare of the people." The goal of the Soviet Union's peaceful competition with capitalist countries is to surpass or approach the current level of the United States in terms of the absolute output of major industrial products within seven years, and then surpass the United States in terms of both the absolute output of industrial products and the output per capita in five years or less, taking the world's first place.

The implementation of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan means that the economic competition between the Soviet Union and the United States, and the competition between the world socialist system and the world capitalist system, have entered a new and decisive stage. At present, the world socialist system, including the Soviet Union, the most powerful socialist country, although its population is less than one-third of the world's population, its industrial output has accounted for more than one-third of the world's total industrial output, and its grain output has accounted for nearly one-half of the world's total output. With the completion of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan and the high-speed economic development of other socialist countries, the industrial output of the world socialist system, according to economists' estimates, will reach more than half of the world's total industrial output. This means that the socialist camp, which already has advantages in popular support, large population, rapid economic development, and the latest scientific and technological developments, will, at that time, also surpass the imperialist camp in terms of material production levels. Human history will reach a new and fundamental turning point.

Faced with the Soviet's peaceful competition plan, the imperialist camp, headed by the United States, is finding it increasingly difficult to conceal its panic. Some bourgeois spokesmen in the United States initially denied the reality of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan altogether. When it became clear that this could not fool anyone, a group of "economists" and "statisticians" came out, saying that the Soviet figures were "exaggerated" and the American figures were "reduced." So, they hurriedly "re-statistized" in an attempt to prove that "free enterprise" was much superior to socialism. However, more sober-minded Westerners are not satisfied with this kind of self-consolation. They admit that the Soviet plan will be implemented on time, and even think that the Soviet Union has overestimated its development speed relative to the United States. The fact is obvious, if "free enterprise" is indeed superior to socialism, then why are the imperialist countries afraid to engage in peaceful competition with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries? Isn't it possible for "free enterprise" to overwhelm socialism in the competition?

We socialist countries are deeply convinced of the superiority of our system and are confident that we can surpass capitalism in peaceful competition. In the next seven years, as long as the industrial production of socialist countries maintains the average annual growth rate of 11% in the past five years, if not faster, and assuming that capitalist countries can also achieve the average annual growth rate of 3% in the past five years, if not slower, then the socialist world will definitely surpass the capitalist world.

The socialist countries advocate peaceful competition not only because we have full confidence in the future, but more importantly because our countries have no other purpose than to develop production and meet the ever-growing needs of the people as quickly and to the greatest extent possible. It is impossible for socialist countries to invade other countries or interfere in other countries' internal affairs, and they absolutely will not. On the contrary, socialist countries pursue a peaceful foreign policy, advocate peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and abide by the principles of peaceful coexistence. As Comrade Khrushchev said in his concluding remarks, "We insist on the view that, regardless of the social system of the country, the people of all countries should live in peace, and disputes between countries should be resolved through peaceful means, rather than through war."

Comrade Khrushchev's proposals in his report on a series of urgent issues concerning the peaceful resolution of current international relations not only represent the will of the Soviet people to safeguard world peace, but also reflect the common aspirations of the people of all socialist countries. The Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan itself, as well as the reports and speeches at the 21st Congress of the CPSU, clearly demonstrate the Soviet Union's sincere desire to ease international tensions. Comrade Khrushchev particularly emphasized the urgent need to sign a peace treaty with Germany, because this is the main key to peace in Europe and world peace. Comrade Khrushchev also proposed: establishing peace zones in the Far East and the entire Pacific region, with the United States ending its aggressive policies against China and other peace-loving countries; breaking the deadlock on disarmament issues, with the major powers reaching an agreement to permanently ban the testing, manufacturing, and use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and rocket weapons; and developing international trade extensively; and so on. All these constructive initiatives will undoubtedly win the approval of all those who are genuinely concerned about world peace and social progress. In his report, Comrade Khrushchev earnestly expressed the friendship of the socialist countries for the newly independent Asian and African countries, and, proceeding from this friendship, pointed out the need for all anti-imperialist forces to strengthen unity and oppose the imperialist conspirators' sabotage of this unity. All sincere and far-sighted patriots in the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will not ignore the great significance of this advice.

Comrade Khrushchev and Comrade Mikoyan, who had just visited the United States, both spoke about improving relations between the two major powers, the Soviet Union and the United States. The Soviet government's recent efforts in this regard are in line with the aspirations of peace-loving people. It seems that powerful groups in the United States are playing a double game: on the one hand, under the pressure of broad sectors of society at home, they have to express to Mikoyan their willingness to end the Cold War; on the other hand, Mikoyan has just left the United States, and they have launched a movement against ending the Cold War. They are clearly not prepared to change the United States' foreign policy of expansion, which is the root cause of international tensions for the thirteen years since the end of World War II. Until now, the United States still occupies hundreds of military bases around the world, and is still trying its best to support the militarist forces of West Germany and Japan. In Asia, the United States occupies China's territory Taiwan, adheres to a policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, creating tensions in the Far East; the American troops are still clinging to South Korea, obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea; South Vietnam, under the control of the United States, is undermining the Geneva Accords, threatening the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and oppressing countries like Cambodia that adhere to a policy of peaceful neutrality. In the Middle East, after the failure of the US aggression against Lebanon, the United States has stepped up its activities to undermine the unity of Arab countries, continues to direct the spearhead of aggression and subversion against the Republic of Iraq, and is actively conducting negotiations with Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan to sign bilateral military agreements to make up for the broken Baghdad Pact. Faced with the rising national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the United States, along with other imperialists, is carrying out bloody suppression, sabotage, and interference. The recent blatant US interference in Cuba's internal affairs is an example.

However, regardless of the subjective wishes of the ruling groups in the United States, the call against continuing the Cold War and demanding the easing of international tensions has become louder and louder, and the forces for maintaining peace and opposing war have become stronger and stronger. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is a strong fortress for the cause of peace. Together with the socialist countries, are many peace-loving nations, the international working class and its vanguard - the Communist Party, the national liberation movements in colonies and semi-colonies, and the mass movements for peace in various countries around the world - all of this constitutes a powerful force for maintaining world peace. Because of the existence of this powerful force for peace, the real possibility of stopping imperialism from launching a new war has increased. With the realization of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan and the rapid economic development of socialist countries, after the industrial production level of the socialist world surpasses the capitalist world, it will be even more difficult or even impossible for imperialism to launch a world war. This prospect will powerfully encourage the people of all countries in their struggle to maintain peace. However, when imperialism has not been forced to abandon its war plans, peace-loving people cannot relax their vigilance in the slightest, and must be prepared at all times to completely smash the desperate adventures of the warmongers. As Comrade Khrushchev said, "As long as capitalism exists, there will always be some people who 'violate common sense' and want to carry out hopeless adventures. But in doing so, they can only accelerate the demise of the capitalist system. Any attempt at aggression will be stopped, and the adventurers will receive their due."

Until now, the diehards in the imperialist camp have still not changed their position of extreme hostility towards the pillar of the world peace cause - the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. There are some idiots who, after discovering that there is no future in other aspects, place their hopes on so-called "changes," "instability," "disagreements," and "chaos" inside the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. However, contrary to their dreams, the 21st Congress of the CPSU showed that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly united, and the anti-Party group has been completely abandoned and crushed. At the same time, the 21st Congress of the CPSU once again powerfully demonstrated the unity of the socialist camp countries, and the unity of the international communist movement.

In his report and concluding remarks, Comrade Khrushchev painfully struck at the vile tricks of the imperialists and the Yugoslav revisionists in sowing discord in the international communist movement and among the socialist camp countries. Imperialists, especially Yugoslav revisionists, have attempted to attack the Communist Parties of various countries as "subordinate" to Moscow, or slander the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for "controlling" the Communist Parties of various countries, using "the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union" as an argument. This kind of nonsense is not worth laughing at for communists. Any true communist wholeheartedly respects the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the first assault team of the international proletariat that broke through the chains of international capitalism. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the party that led the Russian proletariat to successfully implement the socialist revolution first, the party that established the first socialist country without class exploitation in human history, the party of the most economically developed and powerful socialist country in the socialist camp, and the long-tested party that has accumulated the richest revolutionary and construction experience, and now it is the first party that is climbing the peak of communism. Only the enemies of the proletariat and the traitors to Marxism-Leninism will deliberately pit the pioneering role of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its role as the center of the international communist movement against the equal and autonomous relationship between the Communist Parties of various countries. The Tito group in Yugoslavia's slander of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on this issue thoroughly exposes their ugly face of betraying proletarian internationalism.

It is not surprising that the imperialists and Yugoslav revisionists have tried every possible means to find and create their imagined "differences" between the Chinese Communist Party and the Soviet Communist Party. Because they know that the unity of the two parties and the two countries of China and the Soviet Union is the strongest fortress of the unity of the socialist camp, and also the strongest fortress of world peace. But our enemies are wasting their efforts. As the congratulatory message signed by Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Although the imperialists and modern revisionists are still playing the conspiracy of undermining the unity of proletarian internationalism, this conspiracy will inevitably suffer a shameful failure as in the past." We Chinese communists cherish the unity and friendship between the two parties and the two countries of China and the Soviet Union as we cherish our own eyes. Protecting and constantly strengthening this unity and friendship is the sacred internationalist responsibility of our Chinese communists and all Chinese people. The strong unity and close friendship between our two parties and two countries of China and the Soviet Union will always be unbreakable.

Since the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties in November 1957, the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the unity of the international communist movement centered on the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have been further strengthened. The declaration of the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties has become the charter of international communist unity. The more the revisionists in Yugoslavia attack the principles of the Moscow Declaration, the clearer the boundary between Marxists-Leninists and revisionists becomes. Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in his report that the main difference between Marxists and revisionists lies in maintaining and strengthening class unity in the struggle against capitalism, for the liberation of the working class, and for the establishment of socialism. It is now clear that deeply unfolding the anti-revisionist struggle has not weakened the cause of the international working class, but has strengthened it.

The international communist movement, in its struggle against modern revisionism, has defended the purity of Marxism-Leninism and strengthened its unity as never before. The speeches of the representatives of the fraternal parties at the 21st Congress of the CPSU vividly expressed the unity of the communists and working classes of all countries with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, and also expressed their determination and confidence to struggle for peace, national independence, and the cause of socialism. More than a hundred years ago, when Marx and Engels co-authored the Communist Manifesto, communism was considered a "specter" haunting Europe. Now, communism has grown into a giant of the era and become the greatest gospel of mankind. Now there is a strong force of 33 million party members in the Communist and Workers' Parties of 83 countries around the world. The 21st Congress of the CPSU will inspire communists around the world to further consolidate the unity of the international communist movement and strengthen their ties with the masses, completely smash the conspiracies of imperialism and its running dogs, and strive for even greater victories in the cause of peace and socialism.

Let us hold high the banner of victory - the banner of peace and socialism - and advance!

### 胜利属于和平和社会主义

    胜利属于和平和社会主义
    举世注目的苏联共产党第二十一次非常代表大会，已经在2月5日胜利闭幕了。这次代表大会的意义，远远超出苏联国内的范围。它不仅向世界进步人类指明了走向共产主义的幸福之路，而且为一切爱好和平人民展示了保障世界持久和平的光辉前景。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会通过的七年计划，既是一个全面展开共产主义社会建设的计划，又是社会主义同资本主义进行和平经济竞赛的一个有决定意义的计划。赫鲁晓夫同志在大会的总结发言中说：“我们希望同资本主义国家进行和平竞赛，希望在发展生产力、发掘国家经济潜力、提高人民的物质和文化福利等方面进行竞赛。”苏联同资本主义国家进行和平竞赛的目标，就是在七年内在主要工业产品的绝对产量方面超过或接近美国现在的水平，然后再用五年或者更短一些的时间，在工业产品的绝对产量和按人口平均计算的产量方面都超过美国而居世界第一位。
    苏联七年计划的实施，意味着苏联和美国之间的经济竞赛，世界社会主义体系和世界资本主义体系之间的竞赛，进入一个新的决定性的阶段。目前，包括最强大的社会主义国家苏联在内的世界社会主义体系，虽然人口不到世界人口的三分之一，但工业产量已经占世界工业总产量三分之一以上，粮食产量已经占世界产量将近二分之一。随着苏联七年计划的完成以及其他社会主义国家经济的高速度发展，世界社会主义体系的工业产量，据经济学家估算，将达到世界工业总产量的一半以上。这就是说，现在已经在人心归向、人口众多、经济发展速度以及最新的科学技术发展等方面居于优势的社会主义阵营，到那个时候，又将在物质生产水平方面把帝国主义阵营抛在后面。人类历史将到达一个新的根本性的转折点。
    面对着苏联的和平竞赛计划，以美国为首的帝国主义阵营越来越难于掩饰自己的惊慌了。美国的某些资产阶级发言人一开始曾经根本否认苏联七年计划的现实性。当这样做显然骗不了人以后，又有一批“经济学家”、“统计学家”跑出来，说什么苏联的数字是“夸大”了，而美国的数字是“缩小”了。于是，他们急忙“重新统计”，企图证明“自由企业”要比社会主义优越得多。但是，头脑比较冷静的西方人士并不满足于这类自慰之词。他们承认苏联的计划将按时实现，甚至还认为，苏联对美国的发展速度估计得过高了一点。事实很明显，如果“自由企业”的确优于社会主义，那末，为什么帝国主义国家还害怕同苏联以及其他社会主义国家进行和平竞赛呢？“自由企业”不是完全可以在竞赛中压倒社会主义吗？
    我们社会主义国家深信我们的制度的优越性，深信我们能在和平竞赛中胜过资本主义。在未来的七年中，社会主义各国工业生产只要保持它们在过去五年中平均每年增长11％的速度，如果不是更快的话，资本主义各国假定也能够达到它们在过去五年中平均每年增长3％的速度，如果不是更慢的话，那末，社会主义世界将肯定地胜过资本主义世界。
    社会主义各国主张和平竞赛，不仅是由于我们对未来具有充分的信心，更重要的是由于我们的国家除了发展生产，尽快地最大限度地日益满足人民不断增长的需要以外，没有任何其他目的。社会主义国家根本不可能也绝对不会侵略别国或干涉别国内政。恰恰相反，社会主义国家奉行和平外交政策，主张社会制度不同的国家和平共处，遵守和平共处的各项原则。正如赫鲁晓夫同志在总结发言中所说的，“我们坚持这样的观点：不问国家的社会制度如何，各国人民应当和平相处，各国之间所产生的争端应当通过和平途径、而不是通过战争途径来求得解决。”
    赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中所提出的关于和平解决当前国际关系中的一系列迫切问题的意见，不仅代表着苏联人民维护世界和平的意志，而且也反映了社会主义各国人民的共同愿望。苏联的七年计划本身，以及苏共第二十一次代表大会上的报告和发言，异常明显地表现了苏联对于缓和国际紧张局势的真诚愿望。赫鲁晓夫同志特别着重地指出了签订对德和约的迫切的必要性，因为这是欧洲和平和世界和平的主要关键。赫鲁晓夫同志还倡议：在远东和整个太平洋区域建立和平地区，美国结束它对中国和其他爱好和平国家的侵略政策；打开裁军问题僵局，有关大国达成永远禁止试验、制造和使用原子武器、氢武器和火箭武器的协议；广泛发展国际贸易；等等。所有这些建设性的倡议，无疑将博得一切真正关心世界和平和社会进步的人们的赞同。赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中恳切地表达了社会主义国家对于新取得民族独立的亚非国家的友谊，并且从这种友谊出发，指出了一切反帝国主义力量加强团结、反对帝国主义阴谋家破坏这种团结的必要。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族独立运动中一切真诚的、有远见的爱国者，都不会忽视这个忠告的重大意义。
    赫鲁晓夫同志和刚刚访问过美国的米高扬同志，都谈到了改善苏美两大国关系的问题。苏联政府最近时期在这方面的努力是符合爱好和平人民的愿望的。看来美国的有势力集团在玩弄两面手法：一方面，在国内广泛阶层的压力下不得不对米高扬表示愿意结束冷战，另一方面，米高扬刚刚离美，又发动一个反对结束冷战的运动。他们显然并没有准备改变美国的对外扩张政策，这个政策是第二次世界大战结束后十三年来国际紧张局势的总根源。直到目前，美国还在全世界霸占着几百个军事基地，还在竭力扶植西德和日本的军国主义势力。在亚洲，美国侵占了中国的领土台湾，坚持敌视中国人民的政策，造成了远东的紧张局势；美国的军队还死赖在南朝鲜，阻挠着朝鲜的和平统一；美国控制下的南越，破坏日内瓦协议，威胁着越南民主共和国，并且压迫着像柬埔寨这类坚持和平中立政策的国家。在中近东，美国在侵略黎巴嫩失败以后，加紧了破坏阿拉伯国家团结的活动，继续把侵略和颠复活动的矛头指向伊拉克共和国，并且积极进行同土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦签订双边军事协定的谈判，来弥补已经破碎了的巴格达条约。对于亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲日益高涨的民族解放运动，美国同别的帝国主义一起，进行血腥的镇压、破坏和干涉。最近美国对古巴内政的粗暴干涉，就是一个例子。
    但是，无论美国统治集团的主观愿望如何，反对继续冷战、要求缓和国际紧张局势的呼声已经越来越响亮，维护和平、反对战争的力量已经越来越强大。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营是和平事业的强大堡垒。同社会主义各国一起的还有许多爱好和平的国家，国际工人阶级及其先锋队——共产党，殖民地和半殖民地的民族解放运动，世界各国争取和平的群众运动——这一切构成了维护世界和平的强大力量。由于存在着这个强大的和平力量，制止帝国主义发动新战争的现实可能性增长了。随着苏联七年计划的实现和社会主义各国经济的迅速发展，在社会主义世界的工业生产水平超过资本主义世界以后，帝国主义要想发动世界战争就更加困难甚至不可能了。这个前景将有力地鼓舞各国人民维护和平的斗争。但是，当帝国主义还没有被迫放弃战争计划的时候，爱好和平人民丝毫也不能放松警惕，要随时准备彻底粉碎战争狂人的绝望的冒险。正如赫鲁晓夫同志所说的，“只要资本主义存在，总会有一些人‘违反常识地’想进行毫无希望的冒险勾当。但是，他们这样做，只能加速资本主义制度的灭亡。任何侵略企图都将被制止，冒险分子也将得到他们应有的下场。”
    直到现在，帝国主义阵营中的顽固派仍然没有改变他们极端仇视世界和平事业的支柱——以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的立场。有这样一些白痴们，他们在发现其他方面没有前途以后，就把自己的希望寄托于苏联和其他社会主义国家内部的所谓“变化”、“不稳”、“分歧”和“混乱”上面。但是，同他们的梦想相反，苏共第二十一次代表大会表明了苏联共产党是空前地团结一致，反党集团是完全被抛弃和被粉碎了。同时，苏共第二十一次代表大会又一次有力地表明了社会主义阵营各国的团结一致，表明了国际共产主义运动的团结一致。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在他的报告和总结发言中，痛痛地打击了帝国主义者和南斯拉夫修正主义者在国际共产主义运动中和社会主义阵营各国间挑拨离间的卑鄙伎俩。帝国主义者特别是南斯拉夫修正主义者试图以“社会主义阵营以苏联为首”为论据，攻击各国共产党“附属”于莫斯科，或者诽谤苏联共产党对各国共产党的“控制”。这种无稽之谈对于共产主义者是不值一笑的。任何一个真正的共产党人，对于冲破国际资本主义锁链的国际无产阶级的第一个击突队——苏联共产党，都衷心地表示尊敬。苏联共产党是领导俄国无产阶级首先成功地实行了社会主义革命的党，是建立起人类历史上第一个没有阶级剥削的社会主义国家的党，是社会主义阵营中经济上最发达、最强大的社会主义国家的党，是积累了最丰富的革命经验和建设经验的久经考验的党，现在又是第一个正在攀登共产主义高峰的党。只有无产阶级的敌人、马克思列宁主义的叛徒，才会别有用心地把苏联共产党的这种先锋作用、作为国际共产主义运动的团结的中心的作用，同各国共产党之间的平等和自主的关系对立起来。南斯拉夫铁托集团在这个问题上诽谤苏联共产党，正是彻底地暴露了他们的背叛无产阶级国际主义的丑恶面目。
    帝国主义者和南斯拉夫修正主义者千方百计地企图在中国共产党和苏联共产党之间寻找和制造他们想像中的“分歧”，这是毫不奇怪的。因为他们知道，中苏两党和中苏两国的团结是社会主义阵营的团结的最强大的堡垒，也是世界和平的最强大的堡垒。但是，我们的敌人白费心机。正如毛泽东同志签署的贺词中所说的，“尽管帝国主义者和现代修正主义者还在玩弄破坏无产阶级国际主义团结的阴谋，但是这种阴谋必将同以往一样遭到可耻的失败。”我们中国共产党人像珍视自己的眼睛一样珍视中苏两党和中苏两国的团结和友谊。保护并且不断地加强这个团结和友谊，是我们中国共产党人和全体中国人民的神圣的国际主义的责任。我们中苏两党和两国的坚强团结和亲密友谊永远是牢不可破的。
    自从1957年11月各国共产党和工人党在莫斯科举行代表会议以来，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，以苏联共产党为中心的国际共产主义运动的团结，已经有了进一步的加强。莫斯科各国共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言成了共产主义者国际团结的宪章。南斯拉夫的修正主义者越是攻击莫斯科宣言的原则，马克思列宁主义者和修正主义者的界限就越是分明。赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中指出，马克思主义者同修正主义者主要区别在于：在反对资本主义、争取工人阶级解放、争取建立起社会主义的斗争中，维护和加强阶级团结。现在人们已经看得很清楚，深入展开反修正主义的斗争，不是减弱了国际工人阶级的事业，而是使它更加强了。
    国际共产主义运动，在同现代修正主义的斗争中，捍卫了马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，空前地加强了自己的团结。在苏共第二十一次代表大会上各兄弟党代表的致词，生动地表达了各国共产党人和工人阶级同苏联共产党和苏联人民的团结一致，也表达了他们为和平、民族独立、社会主义事业而斗争的决心和信心。一百多年以前，马克思和恩格斯合写共产党宣言的时候，共产主义曾被认为是在欧洲踯躅的“怪影”。现在，共产主义已经成长为时代的巨人，成为人类的最大的福音。现在全世界已经有包括八十三个国家的共产党和工人党的三千三百万党员的强大队伍。苏共第二十一次代表大会将激励全世界的共产党人，进一步巩固国际共产主义运动的团结和加强自己同人民群众的联系，彻底粉碎帝国主义及其走狗的阴谋，争取和平和社会主义事业的更加伟大的胜利。
    让我们高举胜利的旗帜——和平和社会主义的旗帜前进！
