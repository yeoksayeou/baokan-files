    The Flowers of Friendship Between the Chinese and Vietnamese People
    Lin Jinzhang, Deputy Head of the Chinese Agricultural Reclamation Exhibition Delegation

    "...Agricultural Communization Will Bring Peace"
    At the invitation of the Vietnamese government, the Chinese government held the Chinese Agricultural Reclamation Exhibition in the spring-like capital of Vietnam, Hanoi, in the winter of 1958. In the short time of more than a month, the exhibition attracted more than 330,000 visitors (excluding visitors to exhibitions in other places). Batches of Vietnamese farmers and officers and soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army visited once, twice, and three times. In particular, leaders of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the Vietnamese government, from President Ho Chi Minh, Premier Pham Van Dong, and various deputy premiers, ministers, and deputy ministers, visited the exhibition several times, observing and studying the exhibits in detail and with patience. When President Ho Chi Minh visited the exhibition, he specially wrote a poem: "The whole people makes a great leap forward, red flags are planted all over the land, agricultural communization will bring peace," as a souvenir. When President Ho Chi Minh was writing the poem, there was a small debate. When President Ho Chi Minh wrote "...agricultural communization..." some people suggested that it would be better to change it to "...agricultural collectivization," but others opposed this view. Finally, President Ho Chi Minh made an explanatory conclusion, saying: "Agricultural communization" is even further than "agricultural collectivization," so "communization" is better than "collectivization." After hearing President Ho Chi Minh's explanation, everyone agreed with this very politically charged conclusion.
    The Chinese Agricultural Reclamation Exhibition Delegation spent nearly two months in Vietnam, holding the exhibition, introducing the materials of China's 1958 Great Leap Forward in agriculture, the scene of the people's commune, the initial achievements and experiences of the Chinese military reclamation farms and state-owned farms in opening up wasteland for production, and visiting agricultural cooperatives and farms in various parts of Vietnam to learn, etc. The Vietnamese government believed that the delegation had done some beneficial work for the socialist construction of the Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese People's Army. Therefore, on the eve of the delegation's departure from Hanoi to return to China, Premier Pham Van Dong personally awarded the Chinese Agricultural Reclamation Exhibition Delegation a "Vietnamese First-Class Labor Medal" and held a grand award ceremony at the Prime Minister's Office. This is not only the glory of the delegation, but also the infinite glory of the Chinese people.

    Two High Tide Movements
    The Chinese Agricultural Reclamation Exhibition in Vietnam coincided with the time when Vietnamese farmers were launching a high tide of agricultural cooperation and a high tide of agricultural production. When the delegation visited the heroic Dien Bien Phu (the place of the shameful defeat of the French invading army in Vietnam) and Moc Chau, Xuan Mai, Thanh Hoa, Hai Phong, Nghi An, Dong Hoi, Vinh Linh, etc., we saw farmers, state-owned farms, and military reclamation farms busily transplanting spring rice everywhere, and deep plowing and close planting were being carried out everywhere, generally increasing by about double compared with previous years. Vietnamese farmers did not pay much attention to the issue of fertilization in the past. Hearing about the enthusiasm of Chinese farmers in accumulating fertilizer, Vietnamese farmers increased the amount of fertilizer applied by accumulating river fertilizer, sea fertilizer, and manure day and night. The same is true for the issue of water conservancy. Day and night, they were scooping water to transplant rice seedlings and repairing dikes to solve the problems of drought and flood, and they are planning large-scale river basin water conservancy projects to permanently solve Vietnam's water conservancy problems.
    Vietnamese farmers launched a lively production competition in the high tide of production. We saw farmers in the suburbs of Hanoi competing with farmers in the suburbs of Nam Dinh: the Xuan La Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Hanoi competed with the farmers in the suburbs of Nam Dinh with a yield of seven tons per hectare of spring rice, and its small-area high-yield plan was ten tons and fifteen tons. The early rice yield plan of the Vinh Tien Agricultural Cooperative near the 17th parallel, the dividing line with South Vietnam, is a high-yield plan with different land sizes of five tons, seven tons, ten tons, fifteen tons, and twenty-five tons per hectare. With great labor enthusiasm, Vietnamese farmers generally increased the production targets for 1959 by 50% to double compared with 1958. We believe that under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, these advanced targets can be achieved.
    In terms of agricultural cooperation, Vietnamese farmers already have some experience and understand the benefits of cooperation to them. As early as the Vietnamese War of Resistance against France in 1949-1950, the Vietnamese Labor Party called on Vietnamese farmers to establish mutual aid teams. By 1953, 53% of the total number of farm households participated in mutual aid teams, and this increased to 58.7% by 1956. The output of general mutual aid teams has increased, and farmers have received practical benefits. For example, during the War of Resistance against France, 330,000 migrant workers were mobilized in six provinces, including Thanh Hoa, to participate in war support work. Thanks to the strength of the mutual aid teams, production was not affected. However, in the second half of 1956, the proportion of mutual aid teams dropped to 21.9% due to the attacks of landlords, and farmers suffered great losses. It began to recover in 1957, and by the autumn of 1958, the original mutual aid teams had basically been restored.
    At the same time as the farmers' mutual aid team movement, several demonstration agricultural cooperatives were established in 1955, increasing to forty-four by 1957, and to one hundred and thirty-four by 1958, including three advanced cooperatives. Their development steps are: mutual aid team - elementary cooperative - advanced cooperative. Because Vietnamese farmers understand the benefits of collective production, they were particularly active in the cooperative movement in the winter of 1958. The Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party stipulated that the task of Thanh Hoa Province was to develop to 300 agricultural cooperatives. According to the secretary of the provincial party committee, this could be exceeded three times, completing more than 1,200 agricultural cooperatives. In some villages, 80%-90% of the farm households participated in the cooperatives, and almost all of them were collectivized. When the delegation went to Vinh Tien Village near the 17th parallel, this village had more than 380 households. Except for 15 households that were not eligible to participate in the agricultural cooperative, all the remaining farm households participated in the agricultural cooperative. This kind of cooperative movement was developing vigorously when the delegation left Vietnam, and the current development situation may greatly exceed what was said earlier.

    Opening Up New Agricultural Bases
    Vietnam also has a lot of wasteland that can be reclaimed. According to the delegation's estimate of the wasteland areas it visited, there are still about hundreds of thousands of hectares of plains, hills, and gentle slopes of barren mountains that can be reclaimed, most of which are hilly wasteland. However, these wastelands have not been surveyed. In the future, with the improvement of wasteland utilization technology, the wastelands that are currently considered unusable can be utilized in the future. Therefore, Vietnam's potential for wasteland reclamation and production is definitely very strong.
    More than 50 state-owned farms have been established in these wasteland areas, of which the military reclamation farms run by the Vietnamese People's Army account for more than two-thirds. Most of the People's Army farms were newly established in the summer and autumn of 1958.
    The reclamation of wasteland and the construction of state-owned farms in Vietnam has gone through a struggle. During the French rule, the French believed that these wastelands had poor soil quality and could not be irrigated, and that rubber could not be grown north of the 17th parallel. Therefore, they believed that the Vietnamese wasteland had no value to be utilized. Even now, some Vietnamese agronomists oppose the reclamation of these wastelands.
    The comrades who run the state-owned farms and the Vietnamese People's Army resolutely fought against these conservative ideas, boldly opened up wasteland for production, and established state-owned farms. While doing so, they constantly sent people to Xinjiang and South China to visit and study the experience of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army in opening up wasteland for production. In particular, in the winter of 1957, the Vietnamese People's Army specially sent several generals and colonels to the state-owned farms of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps to patiently study the successful experiences and failures of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps in opening up wasteland for production and running state-owned farms as a reference for the Vietnamese People's Army to open up wasteland for production and run farms. Therefore, the officers and soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army are very familiar with the farm conditions in the three major reclamation areas of Xinjiang, Mishan, and South China. When the delegation visited their farms this time, many military reclamation farms specially held "Xinjiang Labor Week," and some farms even built roads to welcome the delegation.
    1958 was a year of rapid development for state-owned farms in Vietnam. Not only were a large number of new farms established, but also a lot of wasteland was reclaimed, and a lot of grain and livestock products were produced. What is particularly meaningful is that in the areas north of the 17th parallel, such as the western wasteland areas of Dong Hoi, Nghi An, and Thanh Hoa, and the Xuan Mai area west of Hanoi, rubber seeds transported from China are cultivating thriving rubber seedlings that have never grown before; further north in Dien Bien Phu, not only has the past battlefield been turned into a farm, planting grain and raising a large number of livestock, but also nurturing rubber seedlings and coffee seedlings. These farms have achieved initial success in opening up wasteland for production and building farms owned by the whole people on ancient wastelands. Many division commanders, regimental commanders, political commissars, and soldiers are very enthusiastic, and they told our delegation with great confidence: 1959 is the second year of wasteland reclamation and production, and they plan to be self-sufficient in production, without state supply and without state investment. They also want to quickly expand reproduction from production accumulation, turn all the wasteland into fertile land, into grain bases, into rubber plantations and coffee plantations, into new agricultural bases, and also new military bases. If the imperialists dare to launch a war of aggression, they are still brave soldiers defending the motherland. Because the Vietnamese People's Army farms in the wasteland areas still maintain military organization, in addition to increasing production tasks, they still have military training tasks. Therefore, the farms of the Vietnamese People's Army have an excellent system with the dual tasks of production and military affairs.
    The Vietnamese people and the People's Army have begun to produce a large amount of grain, milk and meat, rubber, coffee, starch, and other military and civilian supplies on these wastelands to increase the material wealth of the Vietnamese people. At the same time, these farms in the wasteland areas will gradually and as soon as possible adopt mechanized operations to promote the mechanization of Vietnamese agriculture. It can also turn the vast wasteland of Vietnam into a socialist paradise with crisscrossing canals and roads, herds of cattle and sheep, lush trees, factories, schools, and clubs. Therefore, the wasteland area of Vietnam is very meaningful for both socialist construction and strengthening national defense.

    Unforgettable Friendship
    China and Vietnam have many things in common in politics, military affairs, and economy. Vietnam was originally a colony (South Vietnam is still a colony now), and China was a semi-colony in the past, basically no different from Vietnam. Therefore, opposing colonial rule and fighting against imperialism externally, and opposing landlord-bureaucrat rule internally, are the same as China. China's Taiwan is still controlled by US imperialism today, and South Vietnam is also controlled by US imperialism. The struggle experience of the two countries can be exchanged and learned from each other in the past, today, and in the future. China and Vietnam are adjacent to each other, and there are many production experiences, especially agricultural production experiences, and the experience of high-yield and wasteland production and the establishment of state-owned farms are worth learning from each other and encouraging each other to accelerate the efforts to build a socialist paradise in China and Vietnam. Therefore, the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people is traditional, and this friendship will definitely achieve greater development. The exciting friendship scenes encountered by the Chinese Agricultural Reclamation Delegation in Vietnam this time are a beautiful flower in development.
    The Chinese Agricultural Reclamation Delegation brought the friendship of the Chinese people to the Vietnamese people, the materials of the Great Leap Forward of Chinese farmers in 1958, and the achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in opening up wasteland for production and building state-owned farms, and conveyed these materials and achievements to the Vietnamese People's Army. When the delegation visited agricultural cooperatives, divisions, and regimental military reclamation farms, they were warmly welcomed. The Vietnamese People's Army almost all welcomed and sent us off with entire divisions, regiments, and companies, and the scenes of gathering moved everyone's hearts. After the delegation returned to China, it also received letters from many Vietnamese comrades saying: "After you left, we couldn't hold back our tears, and it took us more than half an hour to restrain them." A soldier from a military reclamation farm once wrote a poem to express the friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people: "Our three mountains are so beautiful, (the scenery of the mountains next to the farm is picturesque) but not as beautiful as our (referring to China and Vietnam) friendship." How lovely and precious all this friendship is! On the road of socialist construction, the flowers of friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people will bloom more beautifully.

    中越人民友谊的花朵
    中国农垦展览代表团副团长　林锦章
    “……农业共产化，便是太平时”
    中国政府应越南政府的邀请，1958年冬在越南美丽如春的首都河内举办了中国农垦展览会，在展出一个多月短暂时间中，观众就有三十三万多人（到各地展出观众未计入）；成批成批的越南农民、越南人民军的官兵一次、二次、三次地来参观。特别是越南劳动党、越南政府领导同志，从胡志明主席、范文同总理和各位副总理、部长、副部长都是几次去展览会参观，详细而耐心地对展品观察研究。胡志明主席参观展览会时，特题诗一首：“全民搞跃进，满地插红旗，农业共产化，便是太平时。”留作纪念。在胡志明主席写诗稿时，曾起了一场小辩论，胡主席写到“……农业共产化，……”一句时，有的人提出改为“……农业公社化”比较好，但是也有人反对这种看法，最后由胡志明主席做解释性的结论说：“农业共产化”比“农业公社化”还远一些，所以“共产化”要比“公社化”好一些。大家听到胡志明主席解释后，都同意了这个政治性很强的结论。
    中国农垦展览代表团，在越南将近两个月工作时间，举办了展览会，介绍了中国1958年农业大跃进素材，人民公社化情景，中国军垦农场和国营农场开荒生产初步成就点滴经验，又到越南各地农业社、农场参观访问学习等等工作。越南政府认为代表团对越南人民和越南人民军做了一些有益社会主义建设工作；为此在代表团离开河内回国前夕，特由范文同总理亲自授予中国农垦展览代表团“越南一级劳动勋章”一枚，并在总理府举行了隆重授勋典礼；这不仅是代表团的光荣，也是中国人民的无限光荣。
    双高潮运动
    中国农垦展览会在越南展出期间，正是越南农民掀起农业合作化高潮和农业生产高潮的时候。代表团去英雄的奠边府（法国侵略军在越南的可耻失败地方）和木州、春梅、清化、海防、宜安、东海、荣林等地参观访问时，到处看到了农民与国营农场、军垦农场在紧张地移栽春季稻，到处在进行深耕、密植，一般都比往年增加一倍左右。越南农民对施肥问题，原来不很注意，听到中国农民积肥干劲，越南农民夜以继日地以积河肥，积海肥，积厩肥等等方法来增加施肥量。水利问题也是一样，夜以继日戽水插秧和修堤坝，以解决旱害与涝害，并正在规划流域性的大型水利工程，求其永久性地解决越南水利问题。
    越南农民在生产高潮中展开了热火朝天的生产竞赛。我们看到河内郊区农民与南定郊区农民比赛：河内郊区的馆罗乡农业社的春季稻以每公顷产七吨与南定郊区农民比赛，它的小面积高产计划有十吨，十五吨的。与南越分界线十七度附近的永进农业社的早稻产量计划，是每公顷为五吨、七吨、十吨、十五吨、二十五吨的不同土地的大小面积生产的高产规划。越南农民以极大的劳动热情，把1959年的生产指标一般都提高到比1958年增加50％到一倍左右。我们相信在越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的领导下，这些先进指标是能够实现的。
    在农业合作化方面，越南农民已经有了一定的经验。懂得合作化对他们的好处。远在1949—1950年越南抗战时期，越南劳动党就号召越南农民建立互助组，到了1953年参加互助组的占总农户53％，到1956年增加到58.7％。一般的互助组的产量都有所增加，农民得到实际好处。如在抗战期间，在清化等六个省动员三十三万民工参加战勤工作，由于互助组的力量，没有影响到生产。可是到了1956年的下半年，互助组由于受到地主的打击，比例下降到21.9％，农民吃了很大的亏。到了1957年就开始恢复，到1958年秋已基本上把原来的互助组恢复了。
    在农民互助组运动的同时，1955年建立了示范性的几个农业合作社，到1957年增到四十四个，到1958年增到一百三十四个，其中有三个高级社。它们的发展步骤是：互助组——初级社——高级社。由于越南农民懂得集体生产的好处，在1958年冬天合作化运动中表现得特别积极。越南劳动党中央规定清化省任务是发展到三百个农业社，据该省省委书记说可以超过三倍，完成一千二百多个农业社，有的乡80％—90％的农户参加了合作社，几乎全部都合作化了。代表团到十七度分界线附近的永进乡，这个乡有三百八十多户，除十五户没有资格参加农业社外，其余的农户全部参加农业社了。这种合作化运动，代表团离开越南时，正在蓬勃开展，目前发展情况可能大大超过前面所说的情况。
    开辟新的农业基地
    越南还有很多荒地可以开垦，按照代表团所到荒区的估计，大约还有几十万公顷的平原、丘陵、缓坡的荒山可以开垦，其中以丘陵荒地占大多数。不过这些荒地都没有经过勘测，将来经过勘测，随着荒地利用技术提高，目前认为不能利用的荒地，将来都可以利用的，因此越南荒地开垦生产潜力肯定是很雄厚的。
    在这些荒区已经建立了五十来个国营农场，其中特别是越南人民军所办的军垦农场占去三分之二之多，人民军的农场大多数是在1958年夏天秋天新建立的。
    越南开垦荒地和建设国营农场，是经过一番斗争的。法国统治时期，法国人认为这些荒地土质不好，不能灌溉，十七度以北不能栽培橡胶，所以认为越南荒地没有被利用的价值。到现在还有个别越南农学家反对开垦这些荒地。
    开办国营农场的同志和越南人民军坚决地同这些保守思想作斗争，大胆地开荒生产，建立国营农场。他们一边在做，一边不断派人到中国的新疆、华南各地参观，研究中国人民和中国人民解放军的开荒生产经验。特别是越南人民军在1957年冬，专门派了几位将官和校官到中国新疆生产建设兵团的国营农场，耐心地研究新疆生产兵团开荒生产、办国营农场的成功经验与失败教训，作为越南人民军开荒生产办农场的参考。因此越南人民军官兵都很熟悉新疆、密山、华南三大垦区的农场情况。这次代表团到他们农场参观访问时，有许多军垦农场特地举行“新疆劳动周”，若干农场还专为代表团修路来欢迎代表团。
    1958年是越南国营农场飞跃发展的一年，不仅仅建立一大批新的农场，还开垦了很多荒地，生产了很多粮食和畜产品。特别有意义的是在十七度往北的地区，如东海、宜安、清化等地区的西部荒区，河内西部的春梅地区，从中国运去的橡胶种子，培育着从未生长过的茁壮橡胶苗；更北的奠边府，不仅把过去战场变为农场，种上粮食，饲养了大批牲畜，也抚育了橡胶苗与咖啡苗。这些农场在古生荒地上开荒生产，建设全民所有制的农场，已经取得了初步成就。许多师长、团长、政委和战士们干劲很大，并且很有信心地对我们代表团说：1959年是开荒生产第二年就打算生产自给，不要国家供给，不要国家投资了。还要很快地从生产积累中去扩大再生产，把全部荒地变为良田，变为粮食基地，变为橡胶园和咖啡园，变为新的农业基地，也是新的军事基地。如果帝国主义胆敢发动侵略战争，他们依然是保卫祖国的英勇战士。因为荒区的越南人民军农场仍旧保持军事组织，除增加生产任务外，他们依旧有军事训练任务，所以越南人民军的农场是有生产、军事双重任务的优良制度。
    越南人民和人民军已经开始在这些荒地上生产大量粮食、乳肉、橡胶、咖啡、淀粉等民需军用物资，以增加越南人民的物质财富。同时，这些荒区的农场，将逐步尽快地采取机械化作业，以推动越南农业机械化。还可以把越南的辽阔荒原变为水渠、道路纵横、牛羊成群、绿树成荫、工厂、学校、俱乐部林立的社会主义乐园。所以越南的荒区不论是对社会主义建设与加强国防力量都是很有意义的。
    难忘的友情
    中国同越南在政治、军事、经济各方面有很多共同之点。越南原是殖民地（越南南方现在还是殖民地），中国过去是半殖民地，基本上与越南没有什么差别。因此对外反对殖民统治，反对帝国主义斗争，对内反对地主买办官僚统治，都是同中国一样的。中国的台湾今天仍被美帝所控制，越南南方也被美帝所控制。两国的斗争经验不论在过去在今天和将来都可以互相交流学习的。中越两国接壤，有许多生产经验，特别是农业生产经验，不论高产与开荒生产建立国营农场的经验都很值得相互学习，共同惕励加速建设中越两国社会主义乐园的努力。因此中越人民牢不可破的友谊是有传统性的，这种友谊一定能够获得更大发展，这次中国农垦代表团在越南所遇到的激动的友谊场面，就是发展中的一束美丽的花朵。
    中国农垦代表团，带去中国人民给越南人民的友谊，带去中国农民1958年大跃进的素材，带去中国人民解放军开荒生产、建设国营农场的滴点成就，把这些素材与成就传达给越南人民军。代表团到各农业社、各师、各团的军垦农场参观访问学习时，受到他们热烈迎送，越南人民军几乎都是整师整团整连来迎送我们，聚别的场面激动每个人的心坎。代表团回国后还接到越南许多同志来信说：“你们走后压不住我们的热泪，哭了半个多小时才抑制住”。曾经有一个军垦农场战士为表达中越两国人民的友谊，题了一首诗：“我们的三位山多美丽，（农场旁风景如画的山）但没有我们（指中国越南）的友谊更美丽”。这一切的友谊是多么可爱与可贵呵！在社会主义建设道路上，中越两国人民的友谊花朵将开得更美丽。
