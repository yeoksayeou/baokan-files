Respecting Teachers and Loving Students, Teaching and Learning from Each Other
A New Situation of Close Cooperation Between Teachers and Students Emerges at Nankai University

(Our newspaper’s correspondent Zhu Zemin reports:) Nankai University, in implementing the Party's educational policy, practices a three-way combination of the Party committee, teachers, and students under the leadership of the Party committee. This has not only achieved new successes in teaching reform and scientific research but has also further established the Party's strong leadership, strengthened the relationship between teachers and students, and created a vibrant situation of jointly advancing in unity.

In the first half of last year, after the double-anti movement and two teaching reforms, Nankai University vigorously exposed and criticized bourgeois educational ideas. Teachers and students helped each other, engaged in criticism and self-criticism, and jointly improved their ideological understanding. Subsequently, the school Party committee put forward the slogan of strengthening Party leadership and strengthening teacher-student cooperation to improve teaching on a new basis. Starting in August last year, the school took advantage of the summer vacation to mobilize all teachers and students to engage in scientific research and compile teaching materials in connection with their majors. Each department was headed by the Party organization's secretary, and all teachers and students formed groups according to their professional nature and scientific research topics to carry out activities. As a result, the entire school completed a large number of scientific research projects in fifty days of hard work, and the liberal arts departments compiled new teaching syllabuses and teaching materials. Through this cooperation, teachers and students specifically felt the importance of Party leadership in practice. Teachers also realized the importance of relying on the strength of the broad masses of students, and students also realized the importance of relying on teachers' guidance and giving full play to teachers' roles.

Currently, various departments of Nankai University have adopted various specific measures in all aspects of teaching and scientific research to implement the Party's leadership and the three-way combination of the Party committee, teachers, and students. In teaching, important activities of the teaching and research sections, such as formulating teaching syllabuses and lecture notes, preparing lessons, and test-teaching key lessons, all absorb student representatives, solicit students' opinions widely, and continuously improve the quality of teaching according to students' requirements. The teaching syllabuses for courses such as General Organic Chemistry, Pesticide Chemistry, and Polymer Chemistry, compiled by teachers and students together under the leadership of the Party branch of the Chemistry Department, not only strengthened ideological content but also closely linked with the domestic reality because they were fully deliberated and discussed by teachers and students and conducted research. The chemistry department's teaching and research sections organized "course group meetings," where teachers, after lecturing for a period, would hold meetings to solicit students' opinions on teaching content and teaching methods.

When the History Department reformed the teaching methods of "Chinese History" and "World History," the department's Party branch first sent people to some schools in Beijing and other places to learn from their experiences, and then, based on the specific situation of the department and referring to these experiences, mobilized teachers and students to offer suggestions. The teaching method of teachers lecturing and students listening in the past was changed to four stages for each unit: teachers making key enlightening reports, students studying independently, teachers and students discussing, and teachers making unit summaries. After such a reform, not only did students improve their learning quality, but teachers also improved their professional level. When the Physics Department merged the courses of General Physics and the Four Major Mechanics (Theoretical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, Electrodynamics, Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics), under the leadership of the department's Party branch, teachers and students repeatedly discussed and aired their views for half a year. Debate meetings were held from the teaching and research group to the entire department. Various opinions were expressed until a consensus was reached and the final decision was officially made.

The implementation of the three-way combination policy has brought about new changes in the relationship between teachers and students at Nankai University. Under the leadership of the Party branch and the Communist Youth League branch, students in many departments conducted discussions on issues such as "How should we treat teachers?" and "What role should students play in the three-way combination?" which corrected the incorrect views of a few students towards teachers. Students have expressed that they should respect teachers and learn scientific and cultural knowledge from them, and also actively help teachers improve teaching. In the implementation of the three-way combination policy, the role of middle-aged and elderly teachers has also been further developed. They enthusiastically work with young students to tirelessly improve teaching and conduct scientific research work. (Attached picture)

    尊师爱生　教学相长
    南开大学出现师生亲密合作新局面
    本报讯　记者朱泽民报道：南开大学在贯彻执行党的教育方针中，实行由党委领导的党委、教师和学生三结合，不仅在教学改革、科学研究等方面取得了新的成绩，而且进一步树立了党的坚强领导，密切了师生关系，出现了在团结中共同前进的生动局面。
    去年上半年，南开大学经过双反运动和两次教学改革，大张旗鼓地揭发批判了资产阶级教育思想观点，师生互相帮助，展开批评和自我批评，共同提高了思想认识。接着，学校党委又提出了在新的基础上加强党的领导、加强师生合作搞好教学的口号。从去年8月份开始，学校利用暑假期间，发动全体师生结合专业大搞科学研究和编写教材。各系都由党组织的书记挂帅，全体师生按专业性质和科学研究题目编成小组展开活动。结果全校在五十天的奋战中完成了大批的科学研究项目，文科各系都编写出了新的教学大纲和教材。经过这次合作，师生们从实践中具体感受到党的领导的重要性；教师们也体会到依靠广大学生力量的重要性，而学生们也体会到依靠教师的指导、发挥教师作用的重要性。
    现在，南开大学各系在教学和科学研究的各个环节中，都采取了多种多样的具体措施来贯彻党委领导下的党委、教师、学生三结合的方针。在教学中，各系教研室的重要活动如制订教学大纲和讲义、备课、重点课试讲等，都吸收学生代表参加，广泛征求学生们的意见，不断根据学生的要求来提高教学质量。化学系在党总支领导下，师生一起编写的普通有机化学、农药化学、高分子化学等课程的教学大纲，由于经过师生充分酝酿讨论和进行了调查研究，使这个大纲不仅加强了思想性，而且密切联系了国内实际情况。化学系各教研室组织了“课程小组会”，教师每讲一个阶段以后，就开会征求学生对教学内容和教学方法等方面的意见。
    历史系在改革“中国史”和“世界史”教学方法时，系党总支先派人到北京等地一些学校去学习经验，然后根据本系具体情况参考这些经验发动师生献计献策，把过去教师讲、学生听的教学方法改成每一单元都分作教师作重点启发报告、学生自学、师生讨论和教师作单元总结等四个环节来进行。经过这样改革以后，不仅学生提高学习质量，教师也提高了业务水平。物理系在合并普通物理学和四大力学（理论力学、量子力学、电动力学、热力学统计学）的课程时，在系党总支领导下，经过半年时间师生反复讨论鸣放，从教研组到全系都召开了辩论会，百家争鸣，各抒己见，直到最后取得一致意见才正式定案。
    三结合方针的贯彻，使南开大学师生之间的关系发生了新的变化。不少系的学生在党支部、团支部的领导下，进行了“应该如何对待教师”和“学生在三结合中起什么作用”等问题的讨论，纠正了原来有少数学生对教师的不正确看法。学生们都表示：既要尊重教师并向教师学习科学文化知识，同时也应该积极帮助教师改进教学。在贯彻三结合方针中，中老年教师的作用也更加发挥出来，他们热情地和青年学生们一起，孜孜不倦地改进教学和进行科学研究工作。（附图片）
    为了进一步提高教学质量，使教学内容真正切合学生实际需要，华中师范学院的老教授杨善基（左二）和学生们一起研究编写讲义。
