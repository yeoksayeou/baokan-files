Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 9th: Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, said in Berlin on February 9th that the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany signifies the security and peace of the German people. Adenauer should know that even if the Bonn government makes no proposals for a German peace treaty, it will still be concluded.

Ulbricht pointed out that the Adenauer government opposes the conclusion of a treaty because it is unwilling to give up atomic armament, unwilling to abandon its revanchist policies towards Poland and Czechoslovakia, and unwilling to relinquish its dependence on the North Atlantic bloc. Adenauer is obstructing a peaceful resolution of the German question; he wants to continue the "Cold War."

Ulbricht said that the more openly Adenauer opposes the solution of the German question, the more the residents of West Germany will see that the German Democratic Republic represents the national interests of the German people. He also said that in order to build a peace-loving Germany, it is necessary to mobilize all the socialist forces of the German Democratic Republic and make the German Democratic Republic a bulwark of peace and socialism.

Ulbricht led a delegation of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany back to Berlin on the 9th after attending the 21st Congress of the CPSU. He spoke about the above issues when addressing a crowd of more than 20,000 welcoming people at the Berlin East Station. In his speech, he also spoke in detail about the great significance of the 21st Congress of the CPSU.

Ulbricht said that in Comrade Khrushchev's report and concluding remarks, special emphasis was placed on guaranteeing peace, demilitarizing West Berlin, and establishing a free city of West Berlin. He said that the draft treaty proposed by the Soviet Union brings peace to us, the German people, and opens the way to restoring the unification of our Germany.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 9th: Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic said in Berlin on February 9th that today the German Democratic Republic maintains normal or friendly relations with more than half of humanity on earth. Bonn's die-hard policy will only make it more isolated.

Prime Minister Grotewohl recently led a government delegation to visit the United Arab Republic, Iraq, India, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and China, and subsequently participated in the 21st Congress of the CPSU.

On the 9th, Grotewohl returned to Berlin from Moscow with the delegation of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

Prime Minister Grotewohl spoke to a crowd of 20,000 welcoming people at the Berlin railway station about the impressions he gained during his visits to the above five countries. He said: "From all these countries, we are convinced that the forces of peace in the world far outweigh the forces of war, and that peace will prevail. Everywhere we heard the songs of peaceful labor and experienced the will of the people of the world to long for peace and friendship."

    乌布利希斥阿登纳反对缔结对德和约
    即使波恩政府不提出任何建议也将会缔结和约
    格罗提渥说德意志民主共和国的朋友大大增加
    据新华社柏林9日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希9日在柏林说，苏联建议的对德和约草案意味着德国人民的安全和和平。阿登纳应当知道，即使波恩政府不对对德和约提出任何建议，对德和约也将会缔结。
    乌布利希指出，阿登纳政府反对缔结和约，是因为它不愿意放弃原子武装，不愿意放弃对波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的复仇政策，不愿意放弃对北大西洋集团的依附。阿登纳阻挠德国问题的和平解决，他要继续“冷战”。
    乌布利希说，阿登纳愈是明目张胆地反对德国问题的解决，就愈使西德居民看到：德意志民主共和国代表着德国人民的民族利益。他还说，为了建立一个爱好和平的德国，有必要调动德意志民主共和国的一切社会主义力量，并且使德意志民主共和国成为和平和社会主义的堡垒。
    乌布利希率领德国统一社会党代表团在参加了苏共第二十一次代表大会后于9日回到柏林。他在柏林东车站上向两万多欢迎群众讲话时谈到了上述问题。他在讲话中还详细地谈到了苏共第二十一次代表大会的伟大意义。
    乌布利希说，在赫鲁晓夫同志的报告和总结发言中，特别重视保障和平、使西柏林非军事化以及建立西柏林自由城市的问题。他说，苏联所提出的和约草案给我们德国人民带来和平，为恢复我们德国的统一开辟了道路。
    据新华社柏林9日电　德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥9日在柏林说，今天德意志民主共和国已经同地球上一半以上的人类保持有正常的或友好的关系。波恩的死硬政策只会使它更加陷于孤立。
    格罗提渥总理最近曾率领政府代表团访问了阿拉伯联合共和国、伊拉克、印度、越南民主共和国和中国，随后又参加了苏共第二十一次代表大会。
    9日格罗提渥同德国统一社会党代表团一道从莫斯科回到柏林。
    格罗提渥总理在柏林车站上向两万名欢迎群众谈到了他在访问上述五个国家时所获得的印象。他说：“从所有这些国家中使我们确信，世界上的和平力量远远超过了战争力量，和平将赢得胜利。我们到处都听到了和平劳动的歌声，体验到了世界人民渴望和平和友好的意志。”
