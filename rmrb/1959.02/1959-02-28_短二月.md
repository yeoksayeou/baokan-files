    Short February

    February has only twenty-eight days, and even in leap years, it only has twenty-nine days, making it the shortest month of the year. Why is it so "unique"? Here's a little history behind it.
    In 46 BC, the Roman Empire's astronomer Sosigenes helped the then Roman Emperor Julius Caesar reform the Egyptian calendar. The reformed Julian calendar originally stipulated that a year be divided into twelve months, with the even-numbered months (such as February, April, June, August, October, and December) being short months with only thirty days, and the odd-numbered months (January, March, May, July, September, and November) being long months with thirty-one days. The year had six long months and six short months, totaling three hundred and sixty-six days. However, this made the year longer than the solar year of three hundred and sixty-five days, five hours, forty-eight minutes, and forty-six seconds by eighteen hours, eleven minutes, and fourteen seconds. In order to ensure that the Julian calendar did not lose its astronomical and seasonal significance over time, it was stipulated that a leap year would have three hundred and sixty-six days (leap year every four years), and a common year would need to subtract one day, resulting in three hundred and sixty-five days. Which month would have a day subtracted in common years? During the Roman Empire, February was the end of the year (March, where the spring equinox occurred, was the beginning of the year), a month for repentance and executions, and the working people considered it the most unlucky month. Therefore, it was decided that a day would be subtracted from February in common years, making it twenty-nine days.
    When Julius Caesar's nephew Augustus became the Roman Emperor, because his birthday was in August, August was made a commemorative month, also called August. However, August was a short month, with only thirty days. Both the number of the month and the number of days in the month were even numbers, which according to Roman customs and traditions, were unlucky. To show respect for Emperor Augustus, another day was taken from the unlucky February and added to August, increasing it to thirty-one days. Thus, February in common years (like this year) has only twenty-eight days.

    短二月

    2月份只有二十八天，即使在闰年的时候，也只有二十九天，是全年中最短的一个月。为什么它这么“与众不同”呢？这里有一段小小的历史。
    纪元前46年，罗马帝国天文学家沙西音诺帮助当时罗马皇帝儒略凯撒对埃及历法作了改革。改革以后的儒略历，原规定一年分为十二个月，其中偶数的月份（如2、4、6、8、10、12月）为小月，只有三十天；奇数的月份（1、3、5、7、9、11月）为大月，有三十一天。全年大小月份各六个，合计三百六十六天。但这样一年要比回归年一年三百六十五日五时四十八分四十六秒长十八小时十一分十四秒。为了使儒略历长期下去不失去天文上与季节上的意义，因而规定闰年为三百六十六天（四年一闰），平年需减去一天，为三百六十五日。在平年中在哪一月份中减去一天呢？在罗马帝国时代2月是岁末（春分所在的3月为岁首）忏悔与行刑的月份，劳动人民都认为是最不吉利的月份。所以就决定平年在2月减去一天成为二十九天。
    到了儒略凯撒的侄子奥古斯都做罗马皇帝时，因为他的生日在8月，就把8月作为纪念月，又叫奥古斯都月。但是8月份是小月，只有三十天。月份数与这月份的天数都是偶数，按照罗马人民的习惯与风俗，偶数是不吉利的。为了表示对皇帝奥古斯都的尊敬，又再从不吉利的2月份中减去一天，放到8月使增加为三十一天。这样2月份在平年（如今年）就只有二十八天了。
