Xinhua News Agency, Harbin Electric Report　The National Conference on Traditional Chinese and Western Veterinary Medicine Research was held in Harbin from January 21st to February 2nd. The conference conveyed the speech of Nie Rongzhen, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Scientific and Technological Commission, at the National Conference on Local Science and Technology Work, summarized the achievements in veterinary science research in 1958, formulated the research plan for 1959, and widely exchanged experiences in research work from various regions.

In the past year, veterinary work across the country has resolutely implemented the principles of scientific research serving production, integrating theory with practice, combining traditional Chinese and Western veterinary medicine, and combining specialized scientific research institutions with mass scientific activities. The vast number of veterinary workers have improved their political awareness and liberated their thinking through a series of political movements such as rectification and anti-rightist struggles, thus achieving great accomplishments. For example, successful research on lapinized bovine pleuropneumonia vaccine, lapinized hog cholera attenuated live vaccine with bovine reaction, and crystal violet glycerol foot-and-mouth disease vaccine; improved and enhanced the manufacturing methods and product efficacy of lapinized hog cholera attenuated live vaccine and swine erysipelas vaccine, and successfully trial-produced new products such as fowl cholera vaccine and brucellosis hydrolysate. Various regions have also researched some more practical comprehensive prevention and control methods. In particular, thanks to the active role of traditional Chinese medicine, the conference summarized the use of acupuncture to treat more than a dozen kinds of livestock diseases such as equine spasm colic, rheumatism, and internal injury lameness; and found many valuable and secret prescriptions for treating lamb dysentery, horse and mule impaction, and other diseases. For example, the traditional Chinese medicine "Bailong San" for treating piglet white scour and "Qibu San" for treating equine fatigue have high efficacy.

The conference emphasized that our country's veterinary medicine has a long history of thousands of years, rich treatment experience and theoretical knowledge, which is the summary of the long-term experience of our working people in fighting livestock diseases, and there are still many secret prescriptions and effective prescriptions circulating in rural and pastoral areas. Therefore, it is very important to accelerate the excavation, collation, and improvement of the rich and colorful heritage of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine. On the other hand, there are about tens of thousands of veterinarians in our country, who have mastered thousands of years of accumulated veterinary theory and treatment experience, can cure many diseases, and are an indispensable force. The conference believes that strengthening the unity and cooperation of traditional Chinese and Western veterinary medicine and accelerating the research and collation of the heritage of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine will play a great role in ensuring the development of China's animal husbandry.

The conference determined that the key research tasks for 1959 are: to study and solve measures to eliminate and control foot-and-mouth disease, glanders, and porcine enzootic pneumonia; to begin studying the application of radioactive isotopes in veterinary medicine; to study the techniques and theories of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine and veterinary drugs, collect and collate traditional Chinese veterinary medicine's individual prescriptions and effective prescriptions, and summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic experience and acupuncture techniques of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine; and to investigate and study major parasitic diseases of livestock and propose effective prevention and control measures. In addition to these national key research projects, the conference also requested provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to determine a number of research projects that would help the development of local animal husbandry based on their specific local conditions.

    全国中西兽医研究工作会议确定 
    加强中西兽医的团结合作
    加速研究祖国兽医学遗产
    新华社哈尔滨电　全国中西兽医研究工作会议1月21日到2月2日在哈尔滨举行。会议传达了国务院副总理、国家科学技术委员会主任聂荣臻在全国地方科学技术工作会议上的讲话，总结了1958年兽医科学研究上的成果，制订出1959年的研究计划，并广泛地交流各地研究工作的经验。
    一年来，全国兽医工作坚决贯彻了科学研究为生产服务、理论联系实际、中西兽医结合、专门的科学研究机关和群众的科学活动相结合的方针；广大兽医工作人员经过整风、反右派斗争等一系列的政治运动，提高了政治觉悟，解放了思想，从而取得巨大的成就。例如：研究成功兔化牛肺疫菌苗、兔化猪瘟弱毒牛体反应疫苗、结晶紫甘油口蹄疫苗；改进和提高了兔化猪瘟弱毒疫苗、猪丹毒菌苗的制造方法和产品效能，试制成功了鸡霍乱菌苗、布氏杆菌病水解素等多种新产品。各地区也研究了一些比较切合实际的综合性防治办法。特别是由于发挥了中医的积极作用，总结出用针灸治疗马痉挛疝、风湿病、内伤跛行等十几种家畜疾病；找到治疗羔羊痢疾、马骡结症等疾病的许多宝贵验方和秘方。如治疗仔猪白痢的中药“白龙散”、治疗马疲劳症的“七步散”等都有很高疗效。
    会议强调指出：我们祖国的兽医学已经有几千年悠久的历史，有丰富的治疗经验和理论知识，是我国劳动人民长期和家畜疾病作斗争的经验总结，还有很多的秘方、验方，流传在各地农村和牧区。因此，加速对丰富多彩的祖国兽医遗产的发掘、整理、提高，十分重要。另一方面，我国约有十数万兽医，他们掌握着几千年积累的兽医理论和治疗经验，能治好很多疾病，是一支不可忽视的力量。会议认为：加强中西兽医团结合作，加速研究整理祖国兽医学遗产，对确保我国畜牧事业发展都将起很大作用。
    会议确定1959年的重点研究任务是：研究解决消灭和控制口蹄疫、马鼻疽以及猪喘气病等方面的措施；开始研究放射性同位素在兽医学上的应用；研究中医的兽医学和兽药的技术和理论，搜集并整理中医兽医的单方、验方，总结中医兽医的诊疗经验和针灸术；调查研究家畜主要寄生虫病，提出有效的防治措施等。除全国性的这些重点研究项目外，会议还要求各省市、自治区，根据本地具体情况，确定一批有助于当地畜牧业发展的研究项目。
