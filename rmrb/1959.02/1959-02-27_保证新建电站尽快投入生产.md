    To ensure a faster pace of national economic development this year, the power industry needs to catch up with greater speed. For the power industry to develop at high speed, it is necessary to accelerate the construction of large and medium-sized modern power plants, striving to put new power plants into production as soon as possible; and to mobilize the masses to run power plants, vigorously developing "small-scale indigenous groups" or "small-scale modern groups."
    Large and medium-sized power plants are the backbone of China's power industry. In 1958, China built and expanded more than 100 large and medium-sized power plants. These power plants have played a huge role in strengthening the power industry and ensuring the great leap forward in industry and agriculture. In order to adapt to the new situation of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in the national economy in 1959, the construction of large and medium-sized power plants this year exceeds any previous year in both quantity and scale.
    There are approximately 241 above-quota power plant projects being newly built and expanded this year, including 167 thermal power plants. The larger ones, such as the Liaoning Power Plant, Fuxin Power Plant, Jilin Thermal Power Plant in the Northeast, the East Suburb Thermal Power Plant in Beijing, and the Wangting Power Plant in Shanghai, are all under construction. There are 74 hydropower stations. Currently, the Sanmenxia, Liujiaxia, Yanguoxia, and Qingtongxia hydropower stations on the Yellow River are under intensive construction. The large-scale Xin'an River Hydropower Station is under intense construction, and the Danjiangkou Hydropower Station on the Han River has also launched a full-scale construction upsurge. The Xinfengjiang Hydropower Station on the upper reaches of the Pearl River is carrying out high-efficiency labor competitions, striving to start generating electricity ahead of schedule this year. Ensuring that these power plants, especially those to be completed this year, are put into production quickly and well is a major and urgent task for the power industry and related regions.
    Accelerating the development of the power industry is one of the key points of this year's economic construction, and large and medium-sized power plants are the key points of the power industry. Relevant departments and regions need to concentrate the necessary forces and take effective measures, in the spirit of the entire nation acting as a coordinated chess game, to ensure the rapid completion of these key projects. To ensure the key points well, it is necessary to have a global perspective and emphasize the communist spirit of collaboration. In terms of project scheduling, labor arrangement, equipment manufacturing, and the supply and use of raw materials, it is necessary to consider the overall interests and give full guarantees to key projects. Some projects that are not very urgent can be postponed to ensure that these key projects are given priority and completed first. Industrial production inherently requires close cooperation. Due to the uneven development of industrial and technological forces in various regions, it is currently very necessary to strengthen cooperation and coordination between regions. For example, the technical forces for installing power plant equipment, the mechanical tools and instruments for construction and inspection distributed in various regions should be uniformly deployed and mutually supported when necessary. Only through unified deployment and full cooperation can the progress of power plant construction be accelerated.
    Among these large and medium-sized power plants under construction, there are also key points. Projects planned to be put into production this year need to be given special attention. Labor arrangements and material use should be guaranteed first this year. The construction of these projects should not be relaxed from beginning to end, and the finishing work should be completed as soon as possible. This will concentrate superior forces, ensure that these projects are put into production at the fastest speed, and prepare the power conditions for the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production as soon as possible. From a regional perspective, the three northeastern provinces are an important industrial base in China, and now there is an urgent need to increase power. The scale of power plant construction this year is also relatively large, and relevant departments and regions should give active support.
    To accelerate the speed of power plant construction, it is necessary to vigorously carry out mass movements and technical revolutions. The experience of 1958 shows that the great leap forward in production and construction first relies on the soaring enthusiasm of the people. In the power sector, due to the mobilization of the broad masses of employees to work hard, practically, and cleverly, the level of design, construction, and installation has greatly improved last year. The time to build a 100,000-kilowatt hydropower station has been shortened from two or three years to one year; the time to build a 25,000-kilowatt to 50,000-kilowatt thermal power station has been shortened from one or two years to half a year. This year, to complete the more massive task of power plant construction, the basic measure is still to vigorously carry out mass movements. A major component of the mass movement on the industrial front is the technical revolution. This is because: to complete production and construction plans in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, the fundamental method is to improve labor productivity through technological revolutions. The soaring enthusiasm of the masses can only achieve "twice the result with half the effort" when guided in this direction. The various good experiences of reforming tools and improving design and construction methods based on the principle of "combining indigenous and modern methods" by power plant construction departments in various places since last year should be actively promoted this year. In the mass movement centered on the technical revolution, it is necessary to liberate the mind, promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, boldly create, and boldly innovate; at the same time, scientific calculations must also be carried out so that all reforms meet scientific requirements. For example, simplified design is a new trend in the development of power design technology and a way to accelerate China's power construction, and should be greatly promoted. However, in the process of simplifying the design, careful analysis must be carried out. After testing, reliable bases are obtained to ensure that the quality meets the requirements. All reforms should be like this, to avoid rework and waste, causing losses. Only in this way can the construction speed be truly accelerated.
    In the construction of new power plants, it is necessary to further comprehensively implement the policy of building more, faster, better, and more economically. That is to say, it is necessary to ensure the speed and quantity of construction, and also to ensure the quality of the project. Quantity and quality are a unity of opposites, and building more, faster, better, and more economically is a dialectical unity policy. Neither aspect can be neglected. Basic construction is a long-term plan, and quality must be paid attention to. Especially for large and medium-sized hydropower stations, the quality is not only related to the effectiveness of power generation after completion, but also to the safety of the lives of the people in the downstream areas of the hydropower station, and the project quality must be effectively guaranteed to meet the requirements. Poor project quality will not only cause losses and waste, but also delay the project progress. In order to make each new power plant built quickly and well, and able to put into production and generate electricity safely in a timely manner, it is necessary to educate cadres and workers to establish a comprehensive view that attaches importance to both progress and quality, and to mobilize the broad masses of employees to carry out technical revolutions and improve project quality. In the process of surveying and designing, attention should be paid to the collection of original data, and the geological and hydrological data should be thoroughly investigated; the construction drawings should not only strive for fast drawing, but also ensure that they are clear and accurate. Construction must be prepared, and there must be a construction organization design; the building materials used must meet the specifications. In addition, it is also necessary to establish and improve the necessary management systems, restore and establish some effective acceptance systems. Some of the regulations on power construction were not reasonable in the past, and were impacted in the mass technical regulation reform movement in the power sector last year. This reform of unreasonable regulations is completely necessary. However, all necessary and reasonable regulations must be established and improved. After the abolition of unreasonable technical regulations, new technical regulations should be established in a timely manner. Combining mass movements with centralized leadership, and unifying the requirements of progress and quality, power plant construction can move forward faster.
    An important key to ensuring that new power plants are put into production as soon as possible is to provide complete sets of power generation equipment in a timely manner, which is decisive for the speed of power plant construction. Therefore, the machinery industry department needs to prioritize the task of manufacturing power plant equipment in the spirit of the entire nation acting as a coordinated chess game, make every effort to accelerate the speed of motor manufacturing, and effectively focus on the matching of power generation equipment.
    This year's power plant construction task is very heavy, and the plan for the year lies in the spring. Now is the crucial moment for the leap forward. We hope that all regions and relevant departments, in the spirit of "grasping tightly from the beginning and grasping tightly from beginning to end," will vigorously grasp the construction of large and medium-sized power plants and put them into production as soon as possible, providing strong power for the leap forward in industry and agriculture.

    保证新建电站尽快投入生产
    今年国民经济更大规模的跃进，要求电力工业高速度赶上前去。电力工业要想高速度发展，一是加速大中型的现代化电站的建设，力争新建电站尽快投入生产；一是发动广大群众办电，大搞“小土群”或“小洋群”。
    大中型电站是我国电力工业的骨干。1958年，我国新建和扩建了一百多座大中型电站。这些电站对壮大电力工业，保证工农业跃进起了巨大的作用。为了适应1959年国民经济更大更好更全面跃进的新形势，今年大中型电站的建设，数量和规模都超过以往任何一年。
    今年新建和扩建的限额以上电站项目约二百四十一个，其中火电站有一百六十七个，较大的有东北的辽宁电厂、阜新电厂、吉林热电厂、北京的东郊热电厂、上海的望亭电厂等都正在加紧施工。水电站有七十四个，目前，黄河上正在加紧修建三门峡、刘家峡、盐锅峡、青铜峡等水电站，规模很大的新安江水电站正在紧张施工，汉水上的丹江口水电站也掀起了全面施工高潮，珠江上游的新丰江水电站正在开展高工效竞赛，力争提前在今年开始发电。保证这些电站、特别是其中要在今年完成的工程又快又好地投入生产，是电力工业部门和各有关地区的一项重大而迫切的任务。
    加速发展电力工业是今年经济建设的重点之一，大中型电站又是电力工业当中的重点。各有关部门和各有关地区需要根据全国一盘棋的精神，集中必要的力量，采取有效的措施，保证这些重点项目尽快完成。要很好地保证重点，就要有全局观点，就要强调共产主义的协作精神。在工程项目排队、劳动力安排、设备制造和原材料的供应及使用等方面，都需要考虑全局的利益，对重点项目给予充分的保证。一些不十分急迫的项目宁可推迟一下，也要保证这些重点项目优先上马，优先完成。工业生产本来就要求有紧密的协作关系。由于各地工业和技术力量发展不平衡，目前十分需要加强地区之间的协作配合。例如，分布各地的安装电站设备的技术力量，施工、检验用的机械工具和仪器，必要的时候，应该统一调度，相互支援。只有统一调度和充分协作，才能加速电站建设的进度。
    在这些建设中的大中型电站当中也有重点。计划在今年投入生产的工程需要特别抓紧。在劳动力安排、材料使用等方面，首先要保证今年。这些工程的施工，自始至终都不能放松，收尾工程尤其要尽快完成。这样就能集中优势力量，保证这些项目以最快的速度投入生产，就能尽快发挥投资效果，为工农业生产大跃进准备好动力条件。就地区来讲，东北三省是我国重要的工业基地，现在又迫切需要增加电力，今年的电站建设规模也比较大，有关部门和有关地区应当给予积极的支持。
    要想加快电站建设速度，必须大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命。1958年的经验说明，生产建设大跃进，首先依靠人民群众的冲天干劲。在电力部门，去年由于发动广大职工群众苦干实干巧干，设计、施工和安装水平都有很大提高。建成一个十万瓩的水电站的时间，由两三年缩短到一年；建成一个二万五千瓩到五万瓩的火电站的时间，由一、二年缩短到半年。今年要完成更加巨大的电站建设任务，基本的措施还是要大搞群众运动。工业战线上群众运动的一个主要内容，是技术革命。这是因为：要又多又快又好又省地完成生产建设计划，根本的办法只有通过技术革命来提高劳动生产率。群众的冲天干劲也只有引导到这个方向，才能收“事半功倍”之效。去年以来，各地电站建设部门根据“土洋并举”的方针改革工具、改进设计和施工方法的各种良好经验，今年应该积极推广。在以技术革命为中心的群众运动中，必须解放思想，发扬敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格，大胆创造，大胆革新；同时也要进行科学计算，使各项改革符合科学要求。例如，简化设计在电力设计技术的发展中是一个新的趋势，是加速我国电力建设的途径之一，应该大大提倡。但是，在简化设计的过程中，要认真进行分析。经过试验，求得可靠的根据，保证质量合乎要求。一切改革都应如此，以免返工浪费，造成损失。这样才能真正加快建设速度。
    新电站建设中要进一步全面贯彻多快好省的方针。就是说，既要保证建设的速度、数量，又要保证工程的质量。数量和质量是对立的统一，多快好省是辩证统一的方针，任何一方面都不能偏废。基本建设是百年大计，必须注意质量。尤其是大中型水电站，质量的好坏，不仅关系到建成后发电的功效，而且关系到水电站下游地区人民群众的生命安全，更要切实保证工程质量合乎要求。工程质量不好，既会造成损失浪费，又要延缓工程进度。为了使个个新电站建设得又快又好，能够及时投入生产安全发电，就必须教育干部、工人树立既重视进度又重视质量的全面观点，发动广大职工开展技术革命，提高工程质量。在勘测设计过程中，要重视原始资料的收集工作，把地质、水文资料切实查清；施工图纸，既要争取出图快，又要保证清楚准确。施工要有准备，要有施工组织设计；使用的建筑材料，一定要合乎规格。此外，还要建立和健全必要的管理制度，恢复和建立一些行之有效的验收制度。关于电力建设的规章制度，过去有一部分不够合理，在去年电业部门群众性的技术规程改革运动中受到了冲击。这种对不合理规章制度的改革完全必要。但是，凡是必要的、合理的规章制度，都要建立和健全起来。不合理的技术规程废除以后，要及时建立新的技术规程。这样把群众运动和集中领导结合起来，把进度和质量的要求统一起来，电站建设就可以更快地前进了。
    保证新电站尽快投入生产的一个重要关键，是及时提供成套的发电设备，这对电站建设速度的快慢具有决定意义。因此，就需要机械工业部门根据全国一盘棋的精神，把电站设备的制造任务摆在优先位置，千方百计加快电机制造速度，并且切实抓紧发电设备的配套工作。
    今年电站建设的任务很重，一年之计在于春。现在正是跃进的紧要关头。我们希望各地区、各有关部门本着“一开始就抓紧，自始至终抓紧”的精神，把大中型电站的建设工作狠狠地抓起来，让它们早日投入生产，早日为工农业跃进供应强大的动力。
