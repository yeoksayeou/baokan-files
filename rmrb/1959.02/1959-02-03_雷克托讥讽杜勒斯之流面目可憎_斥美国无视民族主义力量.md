Xinhua News Agency, Manila, February 2nd – According to a report in the "Manila Chronicle" on February 1st, Philippine Senator Recto sarcastically remarked at a press conference on January 31st that "ugly Americans" need "some cosmetic surgery" in the face of the strong nationalist movement sweeping this part of the world.

"The Ugly American" is the title of a novel criticizing the behavior and attitude of American diplomats in Asia.

Recto made these remarks while commenting on U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's statement on January 27th. Dulles had said that the issues straining Philippine-American relations were merely "superficial friction in certain areas."

Recto said, let the Americans continue to hold this view, they will one day wake up in the morning and find that the West has lost the Philippines. Recto said that nationalism is the most important reality in the world today, and nationalism has deeply penetrated the hearts of people in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. He said that the poor people of the world have realized that national freedom is the key to their country's prosperity.

He further warned that if the United States ignores this force, it will make a mistake. This force is already irresistible, and today no representative of any colonial country dares to make remarks against nationalism as they did eight years ago."

Referring to the recent article in the American "Time" magazine attacking the Philippine President, he said that this magazine usually focuses its "vile" attacks on Asian and South American countries.

    雷克托讥讽杜勒斯之流面目可憎
    斥美国无视民族主义力量
    新华社2日讯　马尼拉消息：据“马尼拉纪事报”2月1日报道，菲律宾国会参议员雷克托1月31日在记者招待会上讥讽地说，“丑恶的美国人”在席卷世界这一部分地区的强烈的民族主义运动面前，“需要作一些美容术”。
    “丑恶的美国人”是一本批评美国在亚洲的外交官的举止和态度的小说的名字。
    雷克托是在评论美国国务卿杜勒斯1月27日的谈话时这样说的。杜勒斯曾经说，使菲美关系紧张的问题只不过是“在某些方面的表面的摩擦”。
    雷克托说，让美国人继续保持这样看法吧，他们会有一天在早上醒来的时候发现西方失去了菲律宾。雷克托说，民族主义是今天世界上最重要的现实，民族主义已深入亚洲、中东和非洲的人心。他说，世界上的穷苦人民已经认识到民族自由是他们国家繁荣的关键。
    他又警告说，如果美国忽视这种力量的话，它就会犯错误。这种力量已经是不可抗拒的了，今天任何殖民国家的代表也不敢像八年前那样发表反对民族主义的言论。”
    他在提到美国“时代”周刊最近攻击菲律宾总统的文章时说，这家杂志通常把它的“卑鄙”的攻击集中在亚洲国家和南美国家上。
