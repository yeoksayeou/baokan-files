People's Daily, Changsha, February 15th: With the spring plowing season approaching, the Yueyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China is vigorously organizing iron and wood workers to go deep into the communes, teams, and residential areas with furnaces and raw materials to rush manufacture and repair small farm tools. This practice has been welcomed by the masses of the county, who universally praise it as having "four goods": First, it is convenient for the people, saving labor; second, they see the goods in person, the quality is good, and it is applicable; third, repairs are quick, meeting production needs; fourth, old materials are fully utilized, which is both economical and cost-effective, solving the difficulty of insufficient raw materials.

In the past month or so, iron and wood workers throughout the county have manufactured and repaired more than 110,000 small farm tools such as hoes and rake heads for production teams and commune members. It is estimated that by the end of February, more than 150,000 small farm tools needed for spring plowing throughout the county can be repaired and manufactured.

After the people's communes were established in Yueyang County, a large number of laborers were liberated in the countryside. According to statistics from the Yueyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the number of people working throughout the county has increased by 30% compared to the past. In winter production, the most prominent problem encountered was the lack of small farm tools. For example, one team of the Changjiang Brigade in Junshan Commune mobilized 64 laborers to accumulate fertilizer in the fields, but only had 32 hoes, resulting in a lot of wasted work. After discovering this problem, the county party committee decided that from December of last year to March of this year, the county and commune agricultural machinery factories and joint factories would focus on the production and repair of farm tools. However, a commune covers a large area, and each production team had to send tools to several agricultural machinery factories in the commune for repair, which wasted a lot of work and could not solve the urgent needs of agricultural production in a timely manner; at the same time, it was also difficult to concentrate raw materials for repair and manufacture. Therefore, the county party committee also adopted the method of iron and wood workers going to the countryside in furnaces and teams. More than 2,000 iron and wood workers were drawn from the county to form more than 600 repair and manufacturing teams (stations), and 257 repair and manufacturing stations were added in brigades and densely populated areas. In addition, 344 mobile repair and manufacturing teams were organized to contract with communes as units, dividing the land to teams, households, and construction sites, and making rounds to repair and manufacture farm tools. The agricultural machinery factories and repair stations of the communes and brigades mainly repaired and manufactured larger farm tools such as plows and harrows, while the mobile repair and manufacturing teams mainly repaired and manufactured small farm tools such as hoes.

When rushing to manufacture and repair small farm tools, various localities also adopted the method of fully relying on the masses and following the mass line to solve the difficulties of insufficient technical strength and lack of raw materials. For example, in solving the problem of insufficient technical strength, the method of masters teaching apprentices and absorbing the masses as assistants on the spot was adopted, learning and doing at the same time. The mobile repair and manufacturing team that went deep into the Sanhe Brigade of Xinqiang Commune only had 12 iron workers and 30 wood workers, so they found 70 assistants and formed a repair and manufacturing team of 112 people. In addition to leaving 43 people to focus on repairing large farm tools, there were also 69 people who were formed into 18 repair and manufacturing groups. Each group was led by one or two technicians, so that there was one group for each production team. In just ten days, they rushed to manufacture more than 2,000 large and small farm tools and repaired more than 4,000, meeting the needs of production. In solving the problem of raw materials, various localities mainly adopted methods such as mobilizing the masses to invest scrap iron and wood, using old materials in new ways, and converting dilapidated farm tools. A total of more than 640,000 catties of iron and steel and 860 cubic meters of wood were solved throughout the county.

At the same time, the county and commune party committees also transferred secretaries and industrial ministers in charge of industry to strengthen the leadership of repairing and manufacturing small farm tools, forming a situation where cadres of communes and teams all grasped farm tools. Wherever the mobile repair and manufacturing teams went, they mobilized the masses to prepare raw materials and repair them as soon as they arrived, closely cooperating. Weidong Commune also held a small farm tool inspection at the brigade level. The repair and manufacturing teams concentrated on rushing repairs, and in only half a month, they solved the difficulty of the lack of small farm tools. (Tan Zengming)

### 岳阳办法好  铁木工人走下乡  就地修造小农具

    岳阳办法好
    铁木工人走下乡  就地修造小农具
    便利群众·节省材料·修得快·质量好
    本报长沙15日电　春耕在即，中共岳阳县委大力组织铁木工人，带着烘炉原料，深入社、队和居民点，赶制赶修小农具。这个作法受到全县群众的欢迎，普遍称赞有“四好”：一是便民利民，节省劳力；二是当面见货，质量好，又适用；三是修得快，能满足生产需要；四是充分利用旧材料，既节省又合算，解决了原材料不足的困难。
    最近一个多月内，全县的铁木工人为生产队和社员制造和修理了锄头、耙头等小农具十一万多件，预计到2月底，全县春耕所需的十五万多件小农具都可修造好。
    岳阳县在人民公社化以后，农村解放了大批劳动力，据中共岳阳县委统计，全县出工人数较过去增加了30％。在冬季生产中，碰到最突出的问题是缺乏小农具。如君山公社长江大队的一个小队，出动六十四个劳力在田间积肥，仅只有三十二把锄头，窝工很大。县委发现这个问题后，决定从去年12月到今年3月，县、社农业机械厂、联合工厂以生产和整修农具为中心。但是，一个公社范围很大，各个生产队都要送到公社几个农业机械厂整修，耽误很多工，而且不能及时解决农业生产的急用；同时，集中修造原材料也很困难。因此，县委又采取铁、木工分炉、分班下乡的办法，全县抽出二千多名铁木工，组成六百多个修造组（站），在大队和人口集中的地方增设了二百五十七个修造站。另外组织三百四十四个流动修造组，以公社为单位，划地包干到队、到户、到工地，巡回修理制造农具。公社、大队的农业机械厂和修配站，以修造犁耙等较大农具为主，流动修造组以修造锄头等小农具为主。
    在赶制赶修小农具时，各地又采取充分依靠群众，走群众路线的办法，解决技术力量不足、原材料缺乏的困难。如在解决技术力量不足时，采取师傅带徒弟，就地吸收群众当助手，边学边做。深入到新墙公社三合大队的流动修造组只有十二个铁工、三十个木工，他们就找了七十个助手，组成一百一十二个人的修造队伍，除留四十三人集中整修大农具外，还有六十九人编成十八个修造小组，每组由一、二个技工带领，做到一个生产小队一个组，只十天就赶制大小农具二千多件，修理了四千多件，满足了生产需要。在解决原材料时，各地主要采取发动群众投资废铁木料、旧料新用、破旧农具改装等办法。全县共解决了六十四万多斤钢铁，八百六十立方公尺的木材。
    同时，县和公社党委都抽调管工业的书记、工业部长加强修造小农具的领导，形成社队干部人人抓农具。流动修造组到哪里，哪里就发动群众准备好原材料，随到随修，紧密配合。渭洞公社以大队为单位还举办了一次小农具大检阅，由修造组集中突击修造，只有半个月，就解决了小农具缺乏的困难。　　（谭增铭）
