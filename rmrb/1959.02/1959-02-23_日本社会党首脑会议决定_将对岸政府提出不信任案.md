Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 22nd: The Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, Suzuki Mosaburo, and Secretary-General Asanuma Inejirō, among others, held a leadership meeting in Sendai today and decided to submit a motion of no confidence against the Kishi Nobusuke government in the House of Representatives in early March, before the 1959 fiscal budget is passed.
    The Socialist Party believes that the Kishi Nobusuke government, in its foreign policy, not only does not change its policy of hostility towards the People's Republic of China, but is also stepping up negotiations on revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," leading Japan down a path of isolation among Asian and African countries and further subjugation to the United States. The Kishi Nobusuke government, in disregard of the Japanese people's urgent desire to ban nuclear weapons, is obstructing the passage in the Diet of a bill on Japan's non-nuclear armament, and is attempting to arm the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" with nuclear weapons. The Kishi Nobusuke government, in violation of the Constitution, is promoting a military expansion plan centered on the nuclear armament of the "Self-Defense Forces," and is widening the gap between the rich and poor among the Japanese people.
    The Socialist Party believes that the Kishi Nobusuke government's education policy is to forcibly implement the "performance rating" system and "moral education," and to undermine the "Social Education Law," carrying out reactionary control. In its labor policy, it is suppressing the labor movement.
    The Socialist Party said that for the sake of Japan's independence, peace, and the stability and improvement of the people's lives, the existence of the Kishi Nobusuke government cannot be tolerated for even a single day.

    日本社会党首脑会议决定
    将对岸政府提出不信任案
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎和书记长浅沼稻次郎等今天在仙台召开首脑会议，决定3月初在众议院通过1959年度财政预算之前对岸信介政府提出不信任案。
    社会党认为：岸信介政府在外交上不仅不改变敌视中华人民共和国的政策，而且正在加紧进行关于修改日美“安全条约”的谈判，使日本走向在亚非各国中陷于孤立和更加屈从美国的毁灭的道路；岸信介政府违背日本国民迫切要求禁止核武器的愿望，阻挠在国会上通过关于日本不进行核武装的议案，企图用核武器武装日本“自卫队”；岸信介政府违反宪法，正在推行一个以“自卫队”核武装化为中心的扩充军备计划，并且使日本国民的贫富越来越悬殊。
    社会党认为：岸信介政府在文教政策方面是要强制实行“勤务评定”制度和“道德教育”，破坏“社会教育法”，进行反动统制；在劳工政策方面是镇压劳工运动。
    社会党说，为了日本的独立、和平和国民生活的安定和提高，一天也不能容忍岸信介政府存在下去。
