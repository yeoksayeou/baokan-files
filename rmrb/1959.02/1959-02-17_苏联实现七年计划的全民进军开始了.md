    The Nationwide Advance of the Soviet Union to Realize the Seven-Year Plan Has Begun
    Dong Feng
    An extraordinary spring has arrived on the Soviet land. In recent days, telegrams and letters from working people in various regions, expressing their determination to successfully complete the Seven-Year Plan, have been flying to Moscow like snowflakes; workers in factories, enterprises, and collective farms are holding meetings, and a labor competition to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule is in full swing. The historic resolution of the 21st Congress of the CPSU has inspired tremendous labor enthusiasm and a sense of patriotic pride.
          Steely Will
    Everyone knows that the Seven-Year Plan sets ambitious and arduous tasks for industrial production, with a projected 80% increase in the total value of industrial output after seven years. How do the workers view this task? "Certain to be completed victoriously" is their common determination. At the same time, many advanced producers have proposed to realize the grand tasks set by the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. For example, the work team led by the famous Soviet Donbas miner Mamai proposed to complete the Seven-Year Plan in five years. Mamai said at the 21st Congress of the CPSU: "Our guarantee is that before the opening of the 21st Congress of the CPSU and throughout 1959, each coal miner will exceed the shift quota by two and a half tons of coal per day and reduce the cost of each ton of coal by one and a half rubles."
    Many coal miners have launched competitions with Mamai's work team. For example, the communist labor team of the Sverdlov 1-2 mine, led by Belousov, responded to the call of the Party Congress to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, signed competition terms with Mamai's work team, and proposed to increase the labor productivity of each miner by 20% in the next seven years, complete the Seven-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule, and overproduce 82,000 tons of fuel beyond the plan during this period.
    What best expresses the feelings of all workers is the speech of socialist labor hero Chulkin at a rally held at the No. 3 mine in the Lviv coal region. He said that it was difficult for them to express the joy that every sentence in Khrushchev's report produced, and they would definitely go all out to victoriously complete the great Seven-Year Plan. Their work team had decided to complete the seven-year task in five years.
    The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that Soviet steel production will increase from 55 million tons in 1958 to 86 million tons to 91 million tons. The increase in steel production in seven years is almost equal to the total steel production of Britain and France in 1957. Although the task is arduous, it cannot stop the determination of the Soviet steelworkers to advance. Steelworker Onishchenkov said at the 21st Congress of the CPSU that all employees of the "Red Sormovo" factory will overproduce 2,000 tons of steel and 2,000 tons of steel products in 1959, over-manufacture one oil tanker beyond the state plan, and reduce costs by 10% compared with 1958. Steelworker Balashkin of the Minsk Automobile Factory put it even better at the Congress. He said, "I can guarantee that I will overproduce three tons of steel per shift. Although this amount is not much, if the excess steel produced during the seven years is added together, plus the labor of millions of Soviet people, it will produce hundreds of thousands, millions of tons of steel. And these excess steel can enable us to accelerate our advance towards communism."
    The machine manufacturing industry also occupies an important position in the Seven-Year Plan, which stipulates that the output of machine manufacturing and metal processing industries should be increased by about 100%. The speech of Klotov, director of the Ural Machine Manufacturing Factory, at the 21st Congress of the CPSU, gave a good answer to this task. "In the future Seven-Year Plan, we can guarantee to expand the output of rolling equipment to 2.5 times, the output of milling equipment to 1.5 times, and the output of earth-moving machinery to 1.5 times." He also said: "The Seven-Year Plan stipulates the expansion of new, modern, and more economical machinery and equipment. We machine manufacturers recognize the great responsibility in realizing this task. Our factory designers have issued an appeal to machine manufacturers, designers, technicians, and researchers across the country, calling on everyone to manufacture the most economical machines in the world in the next seven years." Everyone knows that the Ural Machine Manufacturing Factory occupies an extremely important position in the Soviet machine manufacturing industry. In the next seven years, more than 50 new types of rolling lathes will be produced in the Soviet Union, but 39 of these machine tools will be produced by the Ural Machine Manufacturing Factory. Undoubtedly, the guarantee made by Klotov is also the wish and determination of all Soviet machine manufacturers.
          Walking Ahead of Time
    What kind of support and labor enthusiasm has the Seven-Year Plan, which marches towards communism, received and aroused among the Soviet agricultural workers! Advanced agricultural cooperatives and advanced areas of agricultural production have expressed their determination to complete the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule and have launched a competition for this purpose. The agricultural workers of Ryazan Oblast took the lead, proposing to complete the milk and meat production targets stipulated by the Seven-Year Plan in two or three years. This loud slogan struck the hearts of agricultural workers throughout the Soviet Union like spring thunder. Many regions, such as Rostov Oblast and Kuban, Stavropol Krai and the Tatar Autonomous Republic, quickly responded to this competition call and proposed to complete the task of livestock products in the Seven-Year Plan in three or four years.
    The agricultural production increase task stipulated by the Soviet Seven-Year Plan is very large, especially in animal husbandry. For example, meat production will double in seven years, and the annual output will reach 16 million tons. If calculated by the yield per hundred hectares of land, 32 quintals should be reached in 1965. Milk production should increase by 70% to 80% in seven years, reaching an annual output of 100 million to 105 million tons. It is indeed not an easy task to double the country's meat production in these few short years. However, the Soviet laborers, encouraged by the grand prospect of communism, know that winning time is a very important issue in the current competition with capitalism. They are determined to victoriously realize the grand goals of the Seven-Year Plan, and the advanced production units and producers have even more boldly announced that they will shorten the time limit for completing the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan by half, or even more than half at once! In this way, the slogan of catching up with the United States in terms of per capita livestock product output can be realized ahead of schedule. Everyone knows that the output of many important agricultural products in the Soviet Union, such as wheat, sugar beets, animal oil, and wool, has long exceeded that of the United States. Milk production also almost reached the level of the United States in 1958. The only difference is meat. If the per capita output of meat catches up with the United States, it will require an annual output of 20 million to 21 million tons of meat, and a yield of 42 quintals per hundred hectares of land. At present, the output of some advanced agricultural cooperatives in the Soviet Union has reached this target, and some have even exceeded this target by more than double.
    On the podium of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, many delegates stated in their speeches not only that they "must complete the Seven-Year Plan for meat and milk production ahead of schedule," but also that they would first increase meat production by one or one and a half times within this year alone. For example, Andreeva, the chairman of the nationally renowned "Comintern" collective farm in Tambov Oblast, Russian Federation, said in her speech: "The collective farms and state farms in Tambov Oblast are following the example of Ryazan Oblast and have also entered the struggle to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, determined to complete the meat and milk production tasks stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan in three years. And decided to increase meat production by one and a half times in the decisive first year of the Seven-Year Plan! And our Comintern farm will achieve a meat yield of 250 quintals and a milk yield of 800 quintals per hundred hectares of land in seven years!" Completing this target will naturally throw the United States far behind.
    Kovaleva, chairman of the "Defending the Motherland" collective farm in the Belorussian Republic, also emphasized in her speech at the 21st Congress of the CPSU that the farm would complete the task of the Seven-Year Plan in three or four years, although the soil conditions of the farm were not good. The chairman of the agricultural cooperative said: "I will never forget Comrade Khrushchev's comments on my speech at the meeting of advanced agricultural workers in the Belorussian Republic. At that time, I said that the land of our agricultural cooperative is sandy, so our harvest is low. Comrade Khrushchev said, don't complain about your land, it has fed you in the past and will feed you in the future. We have thought about these words again and again. Indeed, we should not complain about the land, but should use these lands as masters. We decided to double meat production this year, reaching 80 quintals per hundred hectares, and milk production reaching 430 quintals. By 1965, we will achieve a meat yield of 186 quintals and milk yield of 982 quintals per hundred hectares of land. If we work hard, we may become a strong rival of the famous Comintern farm in Tambov Oblast in the competition." Kovaleva also listed plans for increasing production in grains, potatoes, and other areas. She also talked about how the farm is working hard to adopt the experience of excellent domestic agricultural cooperatives and all new advanced things in order to complete such an unprecedented task, how it is building livestock houses suitable for animal husbandry requirements, establishing a strong feed base, establishing artificially cultivated pastures, and adopting electric milking, etc. How can these amazing high targets, specific and detailed measures, and full labor enthusiasm not win the stormy applause of the attending representatives.
    Party representative Boko from the Lenin Collective Farm in Poltava Oblast, Ukraine, said that their agricultural cooperative wants to achieve a milk yield of 1,000 quintals and a meat yield of 250 quintals per hundred hectares of land, but not by 1965 at the end of the Seven-Year Plan, but by 1962! They are determined to outdo the Comintern agricultural cooperative in Tambov Oblast.
    The movement to produce 250 quintals of meat and 1,000 quintals of milk per hundred hectares of land has been born and unfolded. Hundreds of collective farms are already fighting for this high target. This is a vivid evidence of the great vitality of the Soviet collective farm system, and it also eloquently shows how enthusiastically the Soviet agricultural workers are starting to realize the Seven-Year Plan.
          People Boiling Over
    From the Arctic Ocean to the Pamirs, from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean, on the vast land of the Soviet Union, the people have been aroused by the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU with tremendous labor enthusiasm. During the days when the Party Congress was being held, an old farmer from Kochetov Village on the Don River stayed close to the radio every night, never leaving it, and listened with infinite joy to how to enter communism faster. He said excitedly, we must work in a new way, so that our conscience will not be condemned in the face of communism. Kibrevich, an assembler at the Kiev Electric Factory, said that today we no longer have the right to work as we did yesterday, and our work team is determined to strive to be a "Communist Labor Team," and each member guarantees to put forward at least two rationalization proposals.
    Working, studying, and living in the spirit of communism is the urgent desire of the vast number of working people throughout the Soviet Union. The "Communist Labor Team" movement is sweeping the country with a surging force. At present, more than 700 work teams throughout the Soviet Union have won the title of "Communist Labor Team," and 35,000 work teams have participated in the competition to strive to be a "Communist Labor Team." The members of the "Communist Labor Team" are worthy of this glorious title. For example, the Mamai "Communist Labor Team," which is famous throughout the Soviet Union, over-mined an average of three and a half tons of coal per day per member in January. The Nikolai Voronin work team of the steel pipe workshop of the Leningrad "Red Vyborger" factory implemented the method of continuous work between shifts, so that each shift produced 350 meters more steel pipe. The "Communist Labor Team" of the Dimitrov 516 Mine in Red Army City overcame the past phenomenon of mutual lack of understanding in life and study. Now the whole team has participated in various amateur studies. After work and on holidays, everyone often gathers together to talk, read, and entertain.
    In these days, the hearts of Soviet youth are even more fiery. The Soviet Communist Youth League members have always been loyal assistants of the Party, and they go wherever the Party points. Just taking the recent few years as an example, more than five million Communist Youth League members and youth armies have responded to the Party's call and rushed to northern, eastern, and Siberian parts of the Soviet Union to participate in various constructions. Today, Soviet youth have put forward another patriotic heroic slogan: During the Seven-Year Plan, Communist Youth League members and youth will make more than 100 large-scale industrial enterprises as youth construction sites, and help lay more than 14,000 kilometers of railways and more than 20,000 kilometers of electrified railways. This year, the Communist Youth League members will build 27 chemical industrial enterprises for the motherland. In the past few years, the Communist Youth League will send more than one million young people to participate in the construction of the Soviet Far East, Kazakhstan, Siberia, and other places.
    Recently, Soviet female Communist Youth League members have put forward a challenge to go to the wasteland, and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League strongly supported their patriotic behavior and decided to select 25,000 girls from the applicants to go to the wasteland. The female Communist Youth League members in Ivanovo City said in the challenge letter issued to the girls across the country that we 350 people have decided to go to the wasteland. Among us are agricultural experts, tractor drivers, but also many people who have never been to the land, but what does it matter, what we don't know today, we can learn tomorrow. Boiling, the people on the Soviet land, they hold hands, shoulder to shoulder, under the red flag of the Lenin Party, rushing forward to the peak of communism!

    苏联实现七年计划的全民进军开始了
    董逢
    在苏联的大地上，一个不平凡的春天降临了。这些天来，各地劳动人民决心胜利完成七年计划的电报和信件，像雪片似地飞向莫斯科；工厂、企业和集体农庄劳动者都在举行集会，为提前完成七年计划的劳动竞赛在热火朝天地进行。苏共第二十一次代表大会的历史性的决议已经鼓舞起巨大的劳动热潮和爱国主义的自豪的感情。
          钢铁般的意志
    大家都知道，七年计划为工业生产规定了宏伟而艰巨的任务，在七年以后，整个工业的总产值将增加80％。工人们是怎样看待这一任务的呢？“一定胜利完成”是他们共同的决心。同时许多先进生产者都提出要提前实现七年计划规定的宏伟任务。例如，苏联顿巴斯的著名矿工马马伊领导的工作队，提出要在五年内完成七年计划。马马伊在苏共第二十一次代表大会上曾说：“我们提出的保证是，在苏共第二十一次代表大会开幕以前和整个1959年，每个采煤工每天要超过工作班定额多采两吨半煤，并且把每吨煤的成本降低一个半卢布。”
    许多煤矿工人都同马马伊工作队展开了竞赛。例如，别洛乌索夫领导的斯维尔德洛夫1—2号矿井的共产主义劳动队，响应了党代表大会的提前完成七年计划的号召，和马马伊工作队签订了竞赛条件，提出在今后七年内把每个矿工的劳动生产率提高20％，提前两年完成七年计划，并在这一期间超计划多生产八万二千吨燃料。
    最能够表达出所有劳动者心情的是社会主义劳动英雄丘尔金在利沃夫煤区第三号矿井举行的集会上的谈话。他说，我们很难表达赫鲁晓夫报告中每一句话使我们产生的愉快，我们一定全力以赴，胜利完成伟大的七年计划，我们工作队已决定五年内完成七年的任务。
    七年计划规定，苏联钢产量将由1958年的五千五百万吨增加到八千六百万吨到九千一百万吨，七年中增产的钢差不多等于1957年英法两国钢产量的总和。任务虽然艰巨，可是却抵挡不住苏联钢铁工人前进的决心。炼钢工人奥尼申科夫在苏共第二十一次代表大会上说，“红色索尔莫沃”工厂全体职工在1959年将超计划生产两千吨钢、两千吨钢材，超国家计划多制造一艘油船，使成本比1958年下降10％。明斯克汽车厂的炼钢工人巴拉申金在代表大会上说得更好。他说，“我可以保证：我每一班将超计划生产三吨钢。这个数量虽不多，但是如果把七年期间超额生产的钢加在一起，再加上千百万苏联人民的劳动，这将会多生产几十万、几百万吨钢。而这些超额生产的钢能够使我们加速向共产主义前进。”
    机器制造业在七年计划中也占有重要的地位，七年计划规定要把机器制造和金属加工业产品产量增加一倍左右。乌拉尔机器制造厂厂长克洛托夫在苏共第二十一次代表大会上的发言，对于这一任务作了很好的回答。“在未来的七年计划中，我们可以保证把辗延设备的产量扩大到二点五倍，把碾磨设备产量扩大到一点五倍，把掘土机的产量扩大到一点五倍。”他还说：“七年计划规定扩大新的、现代化和更经济的机器设备，我们机器制造者认识到在实现这一任务方面的巨大责任。我们工厂的设计人员已向全国机器制造者、设计师、技术员和研究员发出了呼吁，呼吁大家在今后七年内要制造出世界上最经济的机器。”大家都知道，乌拉尔机器制造厂在苏联的机器制造业中占有极重要的地位。在未来的七年中，苏联国内将生产五十多种新式的辗压车床，可是其中三十九种机床是要乌拉尔机器制造厂来生产的。无疑，克洛托夫提出的保证也是苏联全体机器制造者的愿望和决心。
          走在时间的前面
    向共产主义进军的七年计划在苏联农业劳动者之间受到了怎样的拥护、激起了怎样的劳动热情啊！先进的农庄和农业生产的先进地区纷纷表示提前完成七年计划的决心，并为此展开了竞赛。梁赞州的农业劳动者一马当先，提出要在二、三年内完成七年计划规定的牛奶和肉类产量指标。这个响亮的口号像春雷般立刻打动了全苏农业劳动者的心。许多地区，像罗斯托夫州和库班，斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区和鞑靼自治共和国等地，迅速响应了这一竞赛号召，都提出在三、四年内完成畜产品七年计划的任务。
    苏联七年计划规定的农业增产任务是很大的，特别在畜牧业方面。例如，肉产量七年间要增加一倍，年产量要达到一千六百万吨。如果以一百公顷用地产量计算，1965年要达到三十二公担。奶产量在七年之中要增产70％至80％，达到年产奶一亿到一亿零五百万吨。在这短短的几年内要把全国的肉产量提高一倍，确实不是轻而易举的事。但是为共产主义的宏伟前景鼓舞着的苏联劳动者，知道赢得时间是当前同资本主义竞赛中非常重要的问题，他们决心胜利实现七年计划的宏伟目标，先进的生产单位和生产者更豪迈地宣布，他们要一下子把完成七年计划任务的期限缩短一半，甚至一半以上！这样，就可以使在按人口平均计算的畜产品产量方面赶上美国的口号提前实现。大家知道，苏联许多重要农产品，像小麦、甜菜、动物油、羊毛等的产量，早已超过了美国。奶产量1958年也差不多达到了美国的水平。所差的只是肉类。如果在肉类方面按人口平均计算的产量赶上美国，就需年产二千万到二千一百万吨肉，按每一百公顷土地产量计算，则需达到四十二公担。目前苏联一些先进农庄的产量已达到了这个指标，甚至有的已经超过这个指标一倍以上了。
    在苏共第二十一次代表大会的讲台上，许多代表在发言中不仅表示“一定要提前完成肉和奶产量的七年计划”，而且要在今年一年之内，就先使肉产量增加一倍或一倍半。例如，苏联全国闻名的俄罗斯联邦唐波夫州“共产国际”集体农庄主席安德烈耶娃在发言中说：“唐波夫州的集体农庄和国营农场追随梁赞州的范例，也投入了争取提前完成七年计划的斗争，决心在三年期间完成七年计划规定的肉类和奶类的生产任务。并决定在七年计划的决定性的第一年就使肉类增产一倍半！而我们的共产国际农庄，在七年中要使每一百公顷土地的肉产量达到二百五十公担，奶产量达到八百公担！”完成这一指标，自然就会把美国远远地抛到后面去了。
    白俄罗斯共和国“保卫祖国”集体农庄主席科瓦列娃在苏共第二十一次代表大会发言时，也着重提到这个农庄要在三、四年内完成七年计划的任务，虽然这个农庄的土壤条件并不好。这位农庄主席说：“我永远不会忘记赫鲁晓夫同志对我在白俄罗斯共和国农业先进工作者会议上发言所提的意见。当时我曾说，我们农庄的地是砂地，因此我们的收成低。赫鲁晓夫同志说，不要抱怨自己的土地，它过去养活过你们，将来也会养活你们。我们对这些话想了又想，的确，不应当抱怨土地，而应当以主人翁的态度来利用这些土地。我们决定今年一年内使肉产量翻一番，每百公顷达到八十公担，奶产量达到四百三十公担。到1965年，要使每一百公顷土地的肉产量达到一百八十六公担，奶达到九百八十二公担。如果我们好好干，我们可能在竞赛中成为唐波夫州著名的共产国际农庄的劲敌。”科瓦列娃还列举了在谷类、马铃薯等方面的增产计划。她还谈到，农庄为完成这样空前的任务，怎样正在努力采纳国内优秀农庄的经验和一切新的先进事物，怎样正在建立适合动物饲养学要求的畜舍，建立强大的饲料基地，建立人工培植的牧场，采用电力挤奶等等。这惊人的高指标，具体细致的措施，充沛的劳动热情，怎能不博得与会代表的暴风雨般的掌声呢。
    来自乌克兰波尔塔瓦州列宁集体农庄的党代表鲍科说，他们农庄要使每一百公顷土地的产奶量达到一千公担，肉类二百五十公担，但却不是到七年计划结束时的1965年，而是在1962年就要达到！他们决心要赛过唐波夫州的共产国际农庄。
    使一百公顷土地产二百五十公担肉和一千公担奶的运动已经诞生了，展开了。几百个集体农庄已经在为这个高指标而奋斗。这是苏联集体农庄制度的伟大活力的鲜明证据，也雄辩地说明了苏联农业劳动者正以多么大的热情着手实现七年计划。
          沸腾了的人们
  从北冰洋到帕米尔，从波罗的海到太平洋，在苏维埃辽阔的疆土上，人们被苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议激起了巨大的劳动热忱。在党代表大会进行的那些日子里，顿河沿岸考切托夫村的一个老农夫每天晚上守住收音机寸步不离，他怀着无限的喜悦倾听怎样更快地跨入共产主义，他激动地说，我们要以新的方式劳动，为的是在共产主义面前良心不受谴责。基辅电器厂的装配工人基布列维奇说，今天我们已经没有权利再像昨天一样地工作，我们工作队坚决争取作“共产主义劳动队”，每个队员保证至少提出两项合理化建议。
    按照共产主义的精神工作、学习和生活，这就是当前全苏广大劳动人民的迫切愿望。“共产主义劳动队”运动正以奔腾澎湃之势席卷全国，目前全苏已有七百多个工作队获得了“共产主义劳动队”的称号，有三万五千个工作队参加了争取作“共产主义劳动队”的竞赛。“共产主义劳动队”的成员们是无愧于这个光荣称号的，例如全苏闻名的马马伊“共产主义劳动队”，在1月份每个队员平均每天超额开采了三吨半煤。列宁格勒“红色维堡人”工厂钢管车间尼古拉·沃罗宁工作队实行了换班不停工的方法，使每个班多生产三百五十公尺钢管。红军城季米特洛夫516号矿井的“共产主义劳动队”克服了过去在生活、学习上互相不了解的现象，现在全队都参加了各种业余学习，在下工后和假日，大家经常聚集在一起谈心、读书、娱乐。
    这些日子里，苏联青年的心更加火热了。苏联的共青团员一向是党忠实的助手，党指到哪里，他们就走到哪里。仅拿最近短短的几年来说，就有五百多万共青团员和青年大军，响应了党的号召奔赴苏联北部、东部、西伯利亚等地参加各项建设。今天苏联青年又提出了爱国主义的英雄口号：七年计划期间，共青团员和青年要把一百多个规模宏大的工业企业作为青年建筑工地，并帮助铺设一万四千多公里的铁路和二万多公里的电气化铁路。今年，共青团员们将为祖国建成二十七项化学工业企业。最近几年，共青团将派一百多万青年去参加苏联远东、哈萨克斯坦、西伯利亚等地的建设。
    最近，苏联女共青团员又提出了到荒地去的挑战，共青团中央大力支持了她们的爱国主义行为，决定从提出申请的姑娘中间选派二万五千名到荒地去。伊万诺沃市的女共青团员在向全国姑娘们提出的挑战书中说，我们三百五十个人决定到荒地上去，我们中间有农业专家，有拖拉机手，但是也有很多人从来没有下过地，可是，这又算得了什么，今天不会的，明天就能学会。沸腾了，苏维埃大地上的人们，他们手拉手、肩并肩，在列宁党的红色旗帜下，向着共产主义的高峰突飞猛进！
