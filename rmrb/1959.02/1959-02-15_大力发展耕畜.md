    Vigorously Develop Draught Animals
    By the People's Daily Commentator

    Everyone knows the tremendous role of draught animals in agriculture and transportation. Under the situation of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture across the country, the demand for animal power in all aspects is even more urgent. We must make an even greater leap forward in the breeding and development of draught animals to meet the needs of the developing situation.

    Can draught animals achieve an even greater and faster leap forward? The answer is yes. In 1958, we already won a great victory in the development of draught animals. In that year, 74.6% of the country's female animals were pregnant, which not only reversed the historical phenomenon of a large number of empty pregnancies in female animals in our country, but also saw the emergence of many "full pregnancy counties" and "full pregnancy communes." Seriously summarizing and promoting the experience of the great leap forward in the breeding and development of draught animals last year, especially the successful experience of those "full pregnancy counties" and "full pregnancy communes," will surely enable our country's breeding and development of draught animals to achieve an even greater and faster leap forward. To achieve a great leap forward in draught animals, we must firmly grasp the three key links of breeding, raising, and use. As long as we truly achieve more births, better raising, and proper use, it is entirely possible to achieve the leap forward target of a 10% net increase rate for large livestock nationwide.

    Doing a good job in breeding and reproduction, so that female animals give birth to more and young animals survive more, is the main key to developing draught animals. At present, there are more than 20 million adult female animals in the country. If we can achieve full mating, full accuracy, full production, and full survival, we can increase the number of young animals by 20 million heads each year. According to the experience of various regions, it is not very difficult to achieve this, as long as the leadership attaches importance to it, strengthens political and ideological work, and breaks down the conservative thinking that still exists among some of the masses who "are afraid of delaying use and are unwilling to let female animals have foals"; as long as we do a good job in technical instruction, so that more people understand breeding techniques and do a good job in the selection and preparation of breeding stock, it is entirely possible to achieve full pregnancy. Doing a good job in mating is only the first step in breeding draught animals. The feeding and use of pregnant female animals, the nurturing of young animals, and other work must be done well in order to achieve full production and full survival. In breeding work, attention should be paid to the improvement of draught animal breeds. All regions should make a plan to strive to realize the improvement of draught animal breeds within a certain period.

    Raising the existing draught animals well, so that each draught animal is sleek and fat, strong and powerful, is a very important measure to develop draught animals, increase animal power, and support the greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. To allow draught animals to work well and reproduce quickly, we must raise them well. Last year's great agricultural harvest meant that conditions for fodder and feed were better than in the past. The current problem is to further improve the feeding management work. People's communes should select politically progressive people with feeding experience to form specialized teams to manage livestock, establish feeding management systems, and carry out work competitions. The specialized teams should not only be responsible for feeding and raising all the draught animals well, but also do a good job in the epidemic prevention work of draught animals.

    The great leap forward in production requires a significant increase in the amount of labor borne by draught animals. How can draught animals contribute more to production? This is a question worth studying. If it is not resolved well, it will either cause a waste of animal power and affect production, or it will damage the animal's body and affect reproduction. In this regard, the method of the Weixing People's Commune in Suiping, Henan is very good. This commune ranks all draught animals according to their type and physique, and then specifically stipulates the amount of work suitable for each grade of draught animal. This strengthens the planned use of draught animals and avoids the phenomenon of excessively light or heavy loads. Communes in various regions can refer to the experience of the Weixing Commune to formulate a system for the use of draught animals. In terms of the use of draught animals, we should also develop the comprehensive utilization of draught animals to give greater play to the role of draught animals. In particular, southern regions should pay more attention to developing the multiple uses of draught cattle.

    Now, the mating season for draught animals and the spring plowing season are approaching. All regions should seize the opportunity to strengthen the feeding management of draught animals, do a good job in the wintering and spring work of draught animals, so that each draught animal is strong and fat, laying a favorable foundation for spring plowing production and mating reproduction, and more powerfully supporting the great leap forward in agricultural production.

    大力发展耕畜
    本报评论员
    耕畜在农业和运输业上的巨大作用，是人人都知道的。全国工农业大跃进的形势下，各方面对畜力的要求更迫切了。必须使耕畜的繁殖发展工作来一个更大跃进，才能适应形势发展的需要。
    耕畜能不能更大更快的跃进呢？回答是肯定的。1958年在发展耕畜上我们已经打了一个大胜仗。这一年全国74.6％的母畜满怀，不仅扭转了我国历史上遗留下来的母畜大量空怀的现象，并且还出现了很多的满怀县、满怀公社。认真地总结和推广去年耕畜繁殖发展大跃进的经验，特别是那些满怀县、满怀公社的成功经验，就一定能够使我国耕畜的繁殖发展获得更大更快的跃进。实现耕畜大跃进，要紧紧抓住繁殖、饲养和使用三个环节。只要真正做到生的多、养的好和使用得当，实现全国大牲畜净增殖率10％的跃进指标是完全可能的。
    作好配种繁殖工作，使母畜生的多，仔畜活的多，是发展耕畜的主要关键。现在全国有二千多万头成年母畜，如果能够作到全配、全准、全产、全活，每年就能增殖仔畜二千万头，根据各地经验，作到这一点并不十分困难，只要领导重视，加强政治思想工作，打破仍然存在于部分群众中的“怕耽误使用不愿让母畜怀驹”的保守思想；只要作好技术传授工作，使更多的人懂得配种技术和作好种畜的选择和准备等工作，实现满怀是完全可以作到的。作好配种工作还只是繁殖耕畜的第一步，对怀孕母畜的饲养和使用，对仔畜的抚育等等工作都需做好，才能实现全产、全活。繁殖工作中要注意耕畜品种的改良，各地应该作出一个规划，争取在一定时期内，实现耕畜良种化。
    把现有的耕畜饲养好，使每头耕畜都毛润膘肥身强力壮，是发展耕畜、增加畜力以支援工农业生产更大跃进的一个很重要的措施。要让耕畜工作得好、繁殖得快，就必须把耕畜饲养好。去年农业大丰收，饲草饲料方面的条件比过去更好了，现在的问题是把饲养管理工作更加提高一步。人民公社应该选拔政治进步，有饲养经验的人组成专管牧畜业的专业队，建立饲养管理制度，开展工作竞赛。专业队不仅要负责把全部的耕畜喂好养好，同时还应该作好耕畜的防疫工作。
    生产大跃进要求耕畜负担的劳动量是大大增加了。怎样才能使耕畜在生产中贡献更大的力量？是个值得研究的问题。解决不好不是造成畜力浪费、影响生产；就是损害畜体、影响繁殖。在这方面，河南遂平卫星公社的办法很好，这个社把全部耕畜按种类、体质排队分等，再具体规定出适合每一等耕畜的工作量。这样就加强了耕畜使用的计划性，避免了负荷畸轻畸重现象。各地公社可以参照卫星公社的经验制定出耕畜使役制度。在耕畜的使役方面，还应该发展耕畜的综合利用，以发挥耕畜的更大作用，特别是南方地区更要注意发展耕牛的多种用途。
    现在，耕畜的配种季节和春耕农忙时期即将来临，各地应抓紧时机，加强对耕畜的饲养管理，做好耕畜的越冬度春工作，使头头耕畜体壮膘肥，为春耕生产和配种繁殖打下有利基础，更有力地支援农业生产大跃进。
