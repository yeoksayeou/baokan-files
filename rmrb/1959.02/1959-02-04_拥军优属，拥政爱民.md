The Spring Festival is approaching, and every year when we celebrate the Spring Festival, we conduct traditional visits to and offer condolences to the People's Liberation Army, families of martyrs, families of servicemen, and disabled veterans. At the same time, the People's Liberation Army also holds various get-togethers and forums with local government agencies and the masses. Through these activities, we further strengthen the relationship between the military, the government, and the people, enhance the patriotic ideology of the people and the troops, and further boost morale and consolidate national defense. The people's support for the military and preferential treatment for families of servicemen, and the People's Liberation Army's support for the government and cherishing of the people, and the close unity between the military and the people, are more concentratedly manifested during the Spring Festival. Around this year's Spring Festival, this activity will be carried out more widely and deeply.

1958 was an extraordinary year. The output of steel, grain, and cotton in our country doubled compared to 1957; culture, education, health, and other construction undertakings have also greatly developed; the vast rural areas of our country have already realized the people's commune system, the socialist and communist consciousness of the people has greatly increased, and their lives have greatly improved. All these great achievements are inseparable from the great feats of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Over the past year, under the leadership of the Party, all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have carried forward the excellent tradition of being both a fighting force and a production team. On the front lines defending the motherland, they have repeatedly thwarted sabotage and harassment from the Chiang Kai-shek clique from the air and sea, especially in the Jinmen battles on the Fujian front, they severely punished the Chiang Kai-shek army. In modern training, they studied diligently and made rapid progress, achieving great results. Not only that, they also brought into play their soaring revolutionary zeal and spared no effort to support and participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. Wherever there is difficulty, there is the People's Liberation Army; wherever support is needed, they go there. In the past year, the commanders and fighters of the PLA's land, sea, and air forces, in addition to defending the motherland, guarding the borders, and carrying out normal training, actively participated in production and construction, contributing more than 59 million working days. In the large-scale water conservancy campaign, they worked with the broad masses of the people, braving wind and snow, blasting stubborn rocks, breaking solid ice, and digging frozen soil, building more than 20,000 water conservancy projects, completing earth and stone work of more than 58 million cubic meters. On the agricultural production front, many troops helped the masses to rush harvest and plant, and deep plow the land. During the flood prevention struggle, the troops went all out to rescue the lives and property of the people, and some soldiers even gave their lives in rescue and disaster relief. The people's own army is so closely connected with the people by flesh and blood, sharing the same breath. They are worthy of being the glorious defenders and builders of the motherland. When celebrating the Spring Festival, celebrating the bumper harvest of industrial and agricultural production in 1958, and welcoming a new year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, areas with stationed troops should actively organize local government agencies, organizations, schools, and the people to conduct visits, offer condolences, and hold get-togethers, so that everyone can earnestly learn the excellent traditions of the People's Liberation Army, and further establish a good atmosphere of military-civilian unity, love for, and support for the People's Liberation Army among the people.

The People's Liberation Army is the army of the people. An important reason for the victory of the People's Liberation Army is that the military and the people are one family, the military loves the people, and the people love the military, like fish and water complementing each other. In order to continuously improve the socialist consciousness of the People's Army and further strengthen the relationship between the military and the people, the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently issued instructions on supporting the government and cherishing the people, stipulating that supporting and assisting the people's communes is the central content of this year's activities to support the government and cherish the people. In this year's Spring Festival activities to support the government and cherish the people, in addition to extending New Year's greetings, paying respects, and holding get-togethers with local residents and local comrades as in previous years; reviewing the relationship between the troops and the localities and the people over the past year, and conducting education on supporting the government and cherishing the people, it is necessary to earnestly study the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and mobilize all officers and soldiers to publicize the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and the superiority of the people's communes to their relatives and local residents. Officers and soldiers participating in rural work should, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, eat, live, and labor with the masses, and continuously improve their political and ideological awareness.

Families of martyrs and families of servicemen have made glorious contributions to the motherland and the people. Their loved ones in the past struggled arduously for the cause of liberation of the Chinese people, some sacrificed their lives, and some were honorably wounded; they have contributed to the country, they have contributed to the people, and they have received the universal respect of the people. Over the past year, many families of martyrs and families of servicemen have brought into play their revolutionary zeal in the nationwide Great Leap Forward and made great contributions. They took the lead in participating in the people's communes, actively publicized the superiority of the people's communes, and worked hard in various national construction projects, greatly promoting the socialist construction cause of the motherland. In the Spring Festival activities of supporting the military and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen in various places, their exemplary deeds in production and construction should be publicized to stimulate the continuous advancement of the broad masses of families of martyrs, families of servicemen, and the people. At the same time, for all families of martyrs and families of servicemen, widespread condolences and visits should be organized to stimulate their political enthusiasm, boost the morale of the troops, and enhance the people's concept of supporting the military and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen. Their difficulties in life, work, and study should be assisted in solving as much as possible. After the rural people's communes were established, the families of martyrs and families of servicemen, due to the implementation of the grain supply system, no longer have problems with eating, but some of them lack labor and their wage income calculated based on the amount of labor is relatively low. Appropriate preferential treatment should be adopted to ensure that the living standards of those families of martyrs and families of servicemen with lower incomes are not lower than the living standards of the general public or slightly higher.

During the Spring Festival, revolutionary disabled veterans should also be given condolences. They shed blood for the country and the people in the past and were wounded. After returning to their hometowns after demobilization, they still invested in productive labor with high revolutionary enthusiasm. They should be allowed to participate in labor within their capacity and given due care at any time. Political and ideological education for them should be strengthened, and assistance should be provided to them in solving their living difficulties when organizing condolences to them around the Spring Festival.

This year is a year of greater leap forward in our country, and the people of the whole country still need to continue to fight hard and strive for greater victories. Through this year's Spring Festival activities of supporting the military and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen and supporting the government and cherishing the people, our entire military and civilians will further strengthen unity, the military will love the people, the people will support the military, the military and the people will be integrated, build the motherland, defend the motherland, and make our country achieve greater and more brilliant victories in the leap forward in 1959.

### 拥军优属，拥政爱民

    拥军优属，拥政爱民
    春节就要到了，我们每年欢度春节的时候，都对人民军队和烈属、军属、残废军人进行传统的慰问；同时，人民解放军也都要和驻地机关、群众举行各种联欢会、座谈会。通过这些活动，进一步密切军、政、民的关系，提高人民群众和部队的爱国主义的思想，进一步鼓舞士气，巩固国防。人民拥军优属、人民解放军拥政爱民，军民之间的亲密团结，在春节期间，更集中地表现出来。今年春节前后，这一活动将会更广泛、更深入地开展起来。
    1958年是极不平凡的一年。我国钢铁、粮食和棉花的产量都比1957年增加一倍；文化、教育、卫生和其他各项建设事业也都有很大发展；我国广大农村已经实现了人民公社化，人民群众的社会主义和共产主义觉悟大大提高，生活大有改善。所有这些伟大的成就，都是和中国人民解放军的丰功伟绩分不开的。一年来，中国人民解放军全体官兵，在党的领导下，发扬了既是战斗队、又是生产队的优良传统。他们在捍卫祖国的战线上，多次粉碎了蒋介石集团来自空中和海上的破坏和骚扰，特别在福建前线金门战斗中，对蒋介石军队进行了严厉的惩罚。他们在进行现代化训练中，勤学苦练，突飞猛进，取得了巨大成绩。不仅如此，他们还发挥了冲天的革命干劲，不遗余力地支援和参加了祖国的社会主义建设事业。哪里有困难，哪里就有解放军；哪里需要支援，他们就到哪里去。去年一年中，解放军陆、海、空三军指挥员战斗员在保卫祖国、守卫边疆、正常训练之余，积极参加生产建设，作了五千九百多万个劳动日。在大兴水利运动中，他们和广大人民一起，冒风雪、炸顽石、破坚冰、挖冻土，修建水利工程两万多项，完成土石方达五千八百多万立方公尺。在农业生产战线上，许多部队官兵帮助群众抢收抢种，深翻土地。在防汛斗争当中，部队更全力抢救人民的生命财产，有些战士甚至在抢险救灾中献出了自己的生命。人民的子弟兵就是这样和人民血肉相连，呼吸相通的。他们不愧是祖国的光荣的保卫者和建设者。当欢度春节，欢庆1958年工农业生产大丰收，迎接更大、更好、更全面的跃进的新的一年的时候，有驻军的地区，应当积极组织本地机关、团体、学校和人民群众进行参观慰问和举行联欢，从而使大家认真地学习人民解放军的优良传统，在人民群众中进一步树立军民团结，热爱和支援人民解放军的良好风尚。
    人民解放军是人民的子弟兵。人民解放军取得胜利的一个重要原因是军民一家，军爱民、民爱军，鱼水相得。为了不断提高人民军队的社会主义觉悟，进一步密切军民关系，最近中国人民解放军总政治部发出了拥政爱民的指示，规定拥护和支援人民公社是今年拥政爱民的中心内容。各级部队在今年春节拥政爱民活动中，除了和往年一样，向驻地居民和地方同志贺年、拜节、联欢；检查一年来部队同地方、同人民群众的关系，进行拥政爱民教育外，要认真学习六中全会决议，动员全体官兵向亲属、驻地居民宣传六中全会决议，宣传人民公社的优越性。参加农村工作的官兵，应当在党委统一领导下，和群众同吃同住同劳动，不断地提高自己的政治思想觉悟。
    烈属、军属对祖国、对人民有着光荣的贡献，他们的亲人过去为了中国人民的解放事业，艰苦奋斗，有的贡献了生命；有的光荣地负了伤；他们有功于国，有功于人民，得到了人民群众的普遍尊敬。一年来，许多烈属、军属在全国大跃进中发挥了革命干劲，作出了很大的贡献。他们带头参加人民公社，积极宣传人民公社的优越性，努力从事国家各项建设，对祖国的社会主义建设事业起了很大的促进作用。各地在春节拥军优属活动中，应宣传他们在生产建设中的模范事迹，激发广大烈属、军属和人民群众不断前进。同时，对于所有烈属、军属，应组织广泛慰问、拜访，激发他们的政治热情，鼓舞部队士气和增强人民群众的拥军优属观念。对于他们生活、工作、学习上的困难，应该尽力协助解决。农村人民公社化以后，烈属和军属由于实行粮食供给制，吃饭已不成问题，但是，他们中有些人缺少劳动力，按劳动多少计算的工资收入比较少。应当采取适当的优待的方式，保证那些收入较少的烈属、军属的生活水平不低于一般群众的生活水平或者稍高一些。
    在春节期间，还应当对革命残废军人进行慰问。他们过去为国家、为人民流了血，负了伤，复员回乡后，仍以高度的革命热情投入生产劳动。应当让他们参加力所能及的劳动，随时给以应有的照顾，加强对他们的政治思想教育，在春节前后组织对他们的慰问时应当帮助他们解决生活上的困难。
    今年，是我国更大跃进的一年，全国人民仍然需要继续苦战，争取更大的胜利。我们全体军民通过今年春节拥军优属、拥政爱民的活动，将进一步加强团结，军爱民民拥军，军民一体，建设祖国，保卫祖国，使我国在1959年的跃进中取得更大更辉煌的胜利。
