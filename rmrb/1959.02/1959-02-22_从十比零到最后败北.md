Title: From Ten to Zero to Final Defeat

I watched a volleyball exhibition match between the "August 1st" Team and the Youth Team. The "August 1st" Team won the first game; however, they lost the second and third games in a row. Fortunately, they won the fourth game. In the fifth game, which was the decisive one, the "August 1st" Team won point after point, reaching ten to zero. At that time, I thought that the "August 1st" Team would definitely win this match. However, the Youth Team remained calm and tenacious, chasing the score ball by ball, until they tied at thirteen. Under this serious situation, the "August 1st" Team became impatient, and their absolute advantage of ten to zero turned into a final defeat.

Victory or defeat is common for military strategists, especially since the strengths of the "August 1st" Team and the Youth Team are comparable. However, the failure of the "August 1st" Team in this match is quite thought-provoking. In the past, during wartime, similar situations often occurred. Sometimes, victory seemed to be within reach, but a slight carelessness and underestimation of the enemy in specific battles resulted in defeat. There are more examples of the opposite: sometimes, we were surrounded by a superior enemy, and the situation was extremely dangerous. At this time, as long as we had a tenacious fighting will, actively looked for the enemy's weaknesses, and fiercely attacked the enemy, we could often turn defeat into victory and turn danger into safety. The mutual transformation of success and failure is common in battles and in daily life. Here, on the basis of objective conditions, people's subjective efforts and tenacious will have a decisive significance.

I think the reason why the "August 1st" Team failed in this match was not for any other reason, but because they became negligent and careless due to the absolute advantage of ten to zero. When they reached ten to zero, they only served "insurance balls," and their spikes were not as fierce as before. They did not take active actions to strive for the final and complete victory diligently. On the other hand, their tenacious opponents showed no signs of panic or discouragement, but calmly responded to the challenge, attacking fiercely, and finally reversed the disadvantage.

One should not be arrogant in victory, nor discouraged in defeat. Even if one is not arrogant in victory, but loses the courage to attack and advance, and is satisfied with the achievements at hand, becoming conservative and stagnant, the result will also be bad. This should be the case in fighting wars, this should be the case in doing work, and of course, this is also the case in playing ball games.

    从十比零到最后败北
    唐平铸
    我看了一场八一队和青年队的排球表演赛。第一局，八一队胜了；可是第二局，第三局，八一队连战皆败。幸好，第四局他们又胜了。到第五局，这是决定的一局，八一队节节获胜，打到十比零。当时我想，这次比赛八一队获胜是不成问题的了。可是，青年队还是那样沉着顽强，一个球一个球地追上去，一直追到十三平。在这种严重局势下，八一队沉不住气了，由十比零的绝对优势，反而落了一个最后的失败。
    胜败乃兵家常事，何况八一队和青年队实力本不相上下。可是八一队这次比赛的失败却颇值得使人深思。过去在战争时期，常有这种类似的情况。有时候，看来胜利已经在望，但是稍一疏忽大意，在具体的战斗中对敌人估计不足，结果吃了败仗。相反的例子就更多：有时候，我们处在优势敌人的包围之中，形势异常险恶，这时，只要我们有顽强的战斗意志，积极寻找敌人的弱点，狠狠地打击敌人，常常会转败为胜，转危为安。成功和失败相互转化的情况，在战斗中和在日常生活中都是常见的。这里，在客观条件具备的基础上，人们主观的努力和顽强的意志，具有决定的意义。
    八一队这次比赛为什么失败，我看不是为了别的，而是因为有了十比零的绝对优势而疏忽大意了。到了十比零，他们发球只是发“保险球”，扣球也不是那样猛了，他们没有采取积极的行动，兢兢业业地争取最后和全部的胜利。而他们的顽强的对手却毫无慌张泄气之意，沉着应战，猛打猛攻，最后将劣势扭转过来。
    胜不骄，败不馁，胜了虽不骄，但失去了进攻、进取的勇气，而满足于到了手的成就，保守停滞起来，结果也是会坏事的。打仗应当这样，干工作应当这样，赛球当然也不例外。
