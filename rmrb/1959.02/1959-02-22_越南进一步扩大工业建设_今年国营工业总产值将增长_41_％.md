Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 21st. Vietnamese Deputy Minister of Industry, Wu Ying, said at a press conference today that Vietnam's state-owned industrial output value is expected to increase by 41% this year compared to last year, and investment in state-owned industrial capital construction will increase by 3.7 times compared to last year.

He pointed out that Vietnam's industrial construction will further expand in scale and accelerate its pace.

This year, the number of industrial construction projects above the quota in Vietnam will reach 55, of which 34 will commence construction this year, and 21 have already commenced construction last year and will continue to be built this year. Eight new factories will begin formal mass production this year, including power plants, fish canneries, and breweries.

Wu Ying said that greater efforts must be made this year to develop the means of production industry, while continuing to pay attention to the development of the consumer goods industry. It is estimated that, compared with last year, the output value of the means of production industry will increase by 49%, and the output value of the consumer goods industry will increase by 33%. The former accounts for 73% of this year's capital construction investment, and the latter accounts for 27%.

In the means of production industry, chemical fertilizers will increase by 77.2% compared to last year, and apatite will increase by 72.2%. In the consumer goods industry, cloth will increase by 30% compared to last year, and tobacco will more than double.

Wu Ying said that this year is the first year for the development of local industry. He said that the key to the development of local industry lies in giving full play to the spirit of self-reliance of the local masses.

Wu Ying said that the achievements of state-owned industrial production in January this year have already fired the first shot for the year's industrial production. Two-thirds of state-owned factories and enterprises overfulfilled their plans by 10% to 59%.

Regarding the implementation of the 1958 state-owned industrial production and construction plan, Wu Ying said that state-owned industrial production in 1958 has achieved great results, overfulfilling the tasks stipulated in the state plan.

Last year, 30 of the 36 state-owned factories and enterprises overfulfilled their annual production plans. The total output value of state-owned industry exceeded the planned target by 11.8%, an increase of 64.4% compared to 1957. Among them, compared with 1957, electricity increased by 64.8%, raw coal increased by 42.7%, fertilizer increased by 45.4%, and the textile industry increased by 11%.

Fifteen industrial construction projects were completed last year. The workload of engineering design increased three times compared to 1957.

Scientific research and geological exploration have also developed considerably. According to the clues provided by mass ore reports, 125 mineral occurrences have been discovered.

Last year, a large number of technical cadres were trained in actual production, and more than 3,000 cadres were sent to technical schools at home and abroad for further study.

Wu Ying said that the overfulfillment of the 1958 industrial production plan is encouraging workers to exert greater efforts to strive for the overfulfillment of the 1959 industrial production plan.

    他指出，越南的工业建设将进一步扩大规模和加快速度前进。
    今年，越南限额以上的工业建设工程将达到五十五个，其中三十四个是在今年内动工兴建，二十一个已经在去年动工，今年将继续修建。今年将有八个新工厂开始正式大批生产，其中有发电厂、鱼罐头厂、啤酒厂等。
    武英说，今年必须用更大的力量来发展生产资料工业，同时也将继续注意发展消费品工业。预计，同去年比较，生产资料工业的产值将增长49％，消费品工业产值将增长33％。前者占今年基本建设投资的73％，后者占27％。
    在生产资料工业中，化学肥料将比去年增长77.2％，磷灰石将增长72.2％。消费品工业方面的布将比去年增长30％，烟草将增长一倍以上。
    武英说，今年是地方工业开始发展的一年。他说，地方工业的发展，关键在于发挥地方群众自力更生的精神。
    武英说，今年1月份国营工业生产成绩已经为全年的工业生产打响了第一炮。三分之二的国营工厂企业超额10％到59％完成了计划。
    关于1958年国营工业生产和建设计划执行情况，武英说，1958年的国营工业生产已经取得了巨大的成绩，超额完成了国家计划规定的任务。
    去年，三十六个国营工厂企业有三十个超额完成全年生产计划。国营工业总产值超过计划指标11.8％，比1957年增长64.4％。其中，同1957年比较，电力增长64.8％，原煤增长42.7％，肥料增长45.4％，纺织工业增长11％。
    去年有十五项工业建设工程完工。工程设计的工作量比1957年增加三倍。
    科学研究工作和地质勘探工作都有相当大的发展。根据群众报矿所提供的线索，已经发现一百二十五处矿苗。
    去年在实际生产中培养了大批技术干部，而且派出了三千多名干部到国内和国外的技术学校去深造。
    武英说，1958年工业生产计划的超额完成，正在鼓舞着工人发挥更大的干劲，来争取超额完成1959年的工业生产计划。
