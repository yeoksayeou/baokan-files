    Turkey's Economic and Political Crisis
    Tao Kai
    The Baghdad Pact Organization Council meeting, which closed in Karachi on January 28th, was a contentious affair. The United States had hoped to use this meeting to pave the way for the signing of the long-discussed bilateral military agreement. However, contrary to its wishes, the three client states of the United States were most interested in their economic problems, which were being exacerbated by the arms race, rather than military issues. They demanded more US "aid," while the US representative openly stated that there were no more funds available. Consequently, the meeting achieved no results on either military or economic matters.
    Among the three remaining Muslim countries in the Baghdad Pact Organization, Turkey has consistently been the most zealous in supporting US aggressive policies and has received the most US "aid." By the beginning of last year, Turkey had received a total of $2.6 billion in US military and economic "aid." However, Turkey's domestic economic situation has been steadily deteriorating in recent years.
    From the beginning of last year, the Turkish government has repeatedly requested increased US "aid" from the United States. It was not until July of last year, when the victory of the Iraqi revolution shook the entire foundation of US rule in the Middle East, that the United States agreed to provide Turkey with a loan of $234 million. In addition, Turkey received a loan of $100 million from the European Economic Cooperation Bureau and a loan of $25 million from the International Monetary Fund. The total amount of loans received by Turkey at that time was $359 million. However, what role did this large sum of new loans play in the Turkish economy?
    As in the past, the conditions for the US to provide the above loans to Turkey were very harsh. These conditions included: devaluation of the Turkish lira; reduction of bank loans to industrialists and businessmen; and prohibition of investment in new and under-construction non-military industrial projects, etc. In addition, the United States imposed strict regulations on the use of this $234 million in "aid." Of this "aid," the United States designated $75 million for "defense," $15 million was paid with surplus agricultural products, and $44 million was for deferred debt payments... Thus, the amount of dollars that Turkey could control on its own was very limited. Therefore, the US "aid" provided in 1958, like previous "aid," was a further rope and chain to bind Turkey.
    After accepting this US "aid," Turkey immediately raised the exchange rate of the US dollar from 2.8 lira to 1 US dollar to 9 lira to 1 US dollar. In the Swiss foreign exchange market, the ratio was as high as 17.5 to 1. The devaluation of the lira caused a continuous rise in the prices of various industrial products, food, transportation, postage, housing, etc. In the past year, Turkey's national debt has increased from 8 billion lira to 13 billion lira. An editorial in Turkey's "Son Havadis" on November 24, 1958, wrote: "Prices have risen two or three times. Daily necessities are not seen in the market. Students have no textbooks, patients have no medicine, and workers have no food. The current economic situation in the country is more terrible than before receiving foreign loans."
    The deterioration of the economic situation has plunged the vast majority of people into unprecedented difficulties. The working class, living on the poverty line, is the first to bear the brunt. For example, in Istanbul, 70% of textile enterprises are facing the threat of closure, and therefore have begun to lay off large numbers of employees. The lives of middle and lower-ranking officials and officers have also been severely affected. "Son Havadis" wrote in an editorial on October 18 of last year: "Families that were once well-off are overwhelmed by rising prices. Low-paid officials and employees are finding it increasingly difficult to feed themselves and raise their children." Junior officers receive less than $50 a month in pay, and everything has to be self-financed. According to the "Washington Star," even entire divisions have to wear summer uniforms in winter.
    Rapidly rising prices and the continued deterioration of material life have made it increasingly intolerable for the vast majority of people. In September of last year, students at Istanbul Technical University demanded an increase in stipends. They criticized rising prices and said they would fight with strikes. Teachers in Sivas also announced a strike at one point, demanding higher wages. In October, workers at the Kayseri Textile Factory, the Kaleikkal Ordnance Factory, and the Ankara Brewery demanded wage increases. At the end of December last year, the Turkish Railway Workers' Union Federation, which has about 40,000 members, held a representative meeting, demanding the protection of workers' rights and a substantial increase in wages. At the beginning of January this year, coal miners along the Caspian Sea held a rally to protest the persecution of mine owners and demand the right to strike. These demands raised by workers and students under the strict control of the Turkish authorities show that the deterioration of Turkey's economic situation has aroused serious dissatisfaction among the masses.
    It is particularly noteworthy that, within the armed forces, the main pillar of the Turkish government, an increasingly strong sense of dissatisfaction is growing due to the hardship of life. In an Ankara dispatch by Constantine Brown published in the "Washington Star" on November 11 of last year, it was revealed that: "Turkish officers are gradually becoming disobedient. The example of the Arab revolt (referring to the Iraqi revolution in July of last year) has fueled dissatisfaction with economic difficulties." The author pointed out that "news about bribery and corruption has affected young officers experiencing economic difficulties." "Nasser and Kassem's prestige is growing among Turkish soldiers." The newspaper warned that it is not impossible for them to launch an uprising, following the examples of Egypt and Iraq.
    Within the Turkish ruling group, the struggle between the ruling Menderes' Democratic Party and the opposition Inonu's Republican People's Party is becoming increasingly acute. Menderes has taken drastic measures to undermine Inonu's prestige in order to paralyze his political activities. Opposition newspapers and Inonu's confidants have been persecuted and attacked. The pro-Inonu newspaper "Ulus" was closed in October of last year, and editor Almann was sentenced to one year in prison. The newspaper had just resumed publication at the end of last year, but on January 22 of this year, it was closed again, and editor Almann was sentenced to an additional year in prison and a fine of 10,000 lira. Tokel, a columnist for "Akis" magazine and Inonu's brother-in-law, was also arrested and sentenced to one year in prison. In addition, Inonu himself was obstructed by police and gendarmes during propaganda tours, and citizens who wanted to meet with him were beaten by the police.
    Opposition to Menderes has also emerged within the Democratic Party. According to reports, a group of 150 members of parliament opposed to Menderes has emerged in the Democratic Party's parliamentary group. The leader of this group is former Defense Minister Erkin, and several other influential members of the Democratic Party have also joined this group. New divisions have also occurred within the Menderes cabinet. Last year, Minister of Transport Ujana, Minister of Industry Iyali, and Minister of State Karafat successively resigned.
    Serious economic difficulties and the ensuing political turmoil have left the Menderes government struggling to cope. Associated Press reporter Webb McKinley admitted in a dispatch from Istanbul at the end of last year: "People are complaining in the big cities. Menderes' political enemies are operating with particular ruthlessness. Newspapers have turned against him. The situation is tense. Menderes is experiencing what is perhaps the most difficult moment since he came to power in 1950."
    Turkey's reactionary ruling group is facing an increasingly serious economic and political crisis. This is the result of the Menderes group's years of reliance on the United States and betrayal of national interests. However, judging from recent developments, the Menderes group has not learned any lessons from this serious situation. On the contrary, the Turkish government is attempting to intensify its suppression of the people, a bill to suppress the people and opposition activities is in preparation, and new victims are being thrown into prison by the government every day. At the recent meeting of the Baghdad Pact Organization Council, Menderes also tried his best to intensify his reliance on the United States and seek more US "aid" in order to continue to maintain his crumbling regime. However, this can only deepen Turkey's political and economic crisis and eventually lead to a dead end.

    土耳其的经济和政治危机
    陶恺
    1月28日在卡拉奇闭幕的巴格达条约集团理事会会议，争吵了一场。美国本想通过这次会议为签订讨论已久的双边军事协定铺平道路，但是，事与愿违，美国的三个仆从国家最感兴趣的，是被扩军备战搞得焦头烂额的经济问题，而不是军事问题。它们要求更多的美“援”，而美国代表则公开表示没有更多资金可供支配。于是，会议在军事和经济问题上，都没有取得什么结果。
    在巴格达条约集团残存的三个穆斯林国家中，土耳其一向对美国的侵略政策最卖力，也是得到美“援”最多的国家。至去年年初止，土耳其共得美国军事和经济“援助”达二十六亿美元之多。但是，土耳其国内经济情况近几年来一直不断恶化。
    去年年初起，土耳其政府又不断向美国提出了增加美“援”的要求。直到去年7月，伊拉克革命胜利、动摇了美国在中东的整个统治基础的时候，美国才同意向土耳其提供二亿三千四百万美元的贷款。此外，土耳其还得到了欧洲经济合作局的一亿美元的贷款和国际货币基金组织的二千五百万美元的贷款。土耳其当时总共得到的贷款数达三亿五千九百万美元。但是，这一大笔新贷款，对土耳其经济又起了什么作用呢？
    和过去一样，美国向土耳其提供上述贷款的条件是非常苛刻的。这些条件包括：土耳其里拉贬值；减少对工商界人士发放银行贷款；禁止向新建的和已动工的非军事性工业项目投资等。此外，美国对于这笔二亿三千四百万美元“援助”的用途又作了严格的规定。在这笔“援助”中，美国指定七千五百万美元用于“国防”，以剩余农产品支付的有一千五百万美元，延付债款的达四千四百万美元……，这样，土耳其能够自己支配的美元，为数就很有限了。因此，1958年所提供的美“援”仍然和以前的“援助”一样，是进一步捆缚土耳其的绳索和锁链。
    土耳其接受了这笔美“援”以后，立即把美元的外汇牌价，从二点八里拉对一美元，提高到九里拉对一美元。在瑞士的外汇市场上，这个比价竟然是十七点五比一。里拉贬值引起了各种工业品、食品、运输、邮费、房屋等价格不断上涨。在去年一年中，土耳其的国债已从八十亿里拉，增加到一百三十亿里拉。土耳其的“松哈瓦迪斯报”1958年11月24日的社论写道：“物价上涨了两三倍。市场上看不到日用品了。学生没有课本，病人没有医药，工人没有食物。国内当前经济情况比得到外国贷款以前更可怕了”。
    经济情况的恶化，使广大人民生活陷入了空前的困境。生活在饥饿线上的工人阶级首当其冲。例如，在伊斯坦布尔，70％的纺织企业都面临着关厂的威胁，因此开始大量解雇职工。中下级官员和军官的生活也受到了严重的打击。“松哈瓦迪斯报”在去年10月18日的一篇社论中写道：“小康之家由于物价上涨而不胜重担。低薪官吏和职员日益难于饱暖和养育儿女”。下级军官每月军饷不足五十美元，而且一切都得自筹。据“华盛顿明星报”透露，甚至整个师团在冬天都不得不穿着夏季军服。
    物价急速上涨和物质生活继续恶化，使广大人民日益无法容忍。去年9月间，伊斯坦布尔工业大学学生要求提高助学金。他们指责物价上涨，并表示将以罢课来进行斗争。西发斯市的教师也一度宣布罢教，要求提高工资。10月份，开塞利纺织厂、开累卡尔兵工厂和安卡拉啤酒厂工人要求增加工资。去年12月底，拥有四万名左右会员的土耳其铁路工人工会联合会举行代表会议，要求保障工人权利，并且大大提高工资。今年1月初，里海沿岸的煤矿工人举行集会，抗议矿主的迫害，并要求有罢工权。工人和学生们在土耳其当局的严密控制下提出的这些要求，表明了土耳其的经济情况的恶化，已引起了人民群众的严重不满。
    特别值得注意的是，在土耳其政府的主要支柱——武装部队中，也由于生活困苦而滋长着越来越强烈的不满情绪。去年11月11日，“华盛顿明星报”发表的一篇康斯坦丁·布朗的安卡拉通讯透露说：“土耳其军官渐渐不听话了。阿拉伯人暴动（按指去年7月的伊拉克革命）的榜样煽起了对经济困难的不满。”作者指出，“有关贿赂和贪污的消息对经济困难的青年军官发生了影响”。“纳赛尔和卡塞姆的威信在土耳其军人中正日渐增长。”这家报纸警告说，他们仿照埃及和伊拉克的办法，发动起义，并非是不可能的。
    在土耳其统治集团内部，在朝的曼德列斯的民主党和在野的伊诺努的共和人民党之间的斗争趋于尖锐化。曼德列斯采取严厉的措施打击伊诺努的威信，以瘫痪他的政治活动。反对党的报纸和伊诺努的亲信受到了迫害和打击。亲伊诺努的报纸“民族报”在去年10月间遭到了封闭，主编阿尔曼被判处徒刑一年。去年年底这个报纸刚复刊，今年1月22日，又被封闭，主编阿尔曼被判增加一年徒刑和一万里拉罚款。“阿基斯”杂志社论作者、伊诺努的妹夫托克尔也被逮捕，被判处一年徒刑。另外，伊诺努本人在进行宣传旅行时，也受到警察和宪兵的阻拦，要求会见他的市民受到了警察的殴打。
    在民主党内部也出现了反对曼德列斯的暗流。有消息说，在民主党议会党团中，已经出现了一个由一百五十个议员组成的反对曼德列斯的集团。这个集团的领导人是前国防部长厄尔金，民主党的其他有影响的若干党员，也参加了这个集团。在曼德列斯内阁内部也发生了新的分裂。在去年，交通部长乌江纳、工业部长伊贾利、国务部长卡拉发特相继提出辞职。
    严重的经济困难以及随之而来的政治动荡，使曼德列斯政府穷于应付。美联社记者韦伯·麦金莱在去年年底的一篇伊斯坦布尔的通讯中承认：“在大城市里人们都在发牢骚。曼德列斯的政敌们在以特别无情的手段从事活动。报纸都转而反对他。局势很紧张。曼德列斯正在经历着也许是他在1950年执政以来最艰难的时刻”。
    土耳其的反动统治集团正面临日益严重的经济和政治危机。这是曼德列斯集团多年来投靠美国、出卖民族利益的结果。然而从最近的情况看，曼德列斯集团并没有从这个严重的情况中得到任何教训。相反的，土耳其政府却企图变本加厉地加强对人民的镇压，一个镇压人民和反对派活动的法案已在准备中，每天都有新的牺牲者被政府投入监狱中。在最近举行的巴格达条约集团理事会会议上，曼德列斯也竭力想用加紧投靠美国，争取更多的美“援”，来继续维持他摇摇欲坠的政权。然而，这只能加深土耳其的政治经济危机，并最后走向绝路。
