Stepping Up to Catch Up with the Advanced: New Look in Wheat Fields
Weinan Chengguan Commune Holds On-Site Meeting to Promote a High Tide of Wheat Field Management

Wheat Field Management Measures of Shuangwang Brigade:

	I. Secretary Takes Command, Captains Take the Lead, Dividing War Zones and Assigning Responsibility. The secretary and captains lead a 26-member wheat field management inspection team. 133 specialized teams are formed to manage wheat fields well, ensuring that every level has dedicated leadership and every mu has a dedicated person responsible. The 11,090 mu of wheat is undergoing a third round of ranking. Before Qingming Festival, efforts will be made to have first-class wheat fields catch up with satellite fields, second-class wheat fields catch up with high-yield fields, and third-class wheat fields catch up with first-class wheat fields. The method of "eating preferential food" and "special treatment" is adopted to ensure that no seedling is lost and no plot is missed.

	II. Launch a Mass Movement. Implement "Two Appraisals" (appraising work grades and work points), "Four Determinations" (determining time, quantity, quality, and labor) and "One Award System," carry out appraisal and competition, and ensure the development of the mass movement from the system.

	III. Grasp the High-Yield Formula and Adhere to the Archive System. The High-Yield Formula Headquarters of the brigade implements "Seven to the Fields" (eating, sleeping, office work, meetings, studying, entertainment, and leadership are all in the fields). Establish a wheat intelligence network for teams, groups, plots, and sections, conduct fixed-point observation and recording, hold regular meetings for research, and solve problems in a timely manner.

	IV. Irrigate the Regreening Water in a Timely Manner and Apply Sufficient Regreening Fertilizer, to ensure large wheat ears, many grains, and full grains.

	V. Finely Harrow and Roll to Enhance the Soil Moisture Retention Capacity of Wheat Fields. It is planned to hoe ordinary wheat fields twice and high-yield plots five times, weed twice, and ensure that there are no weeds in the fields.

	VI. Reform 5,000 pieces of farm tools before spring plowing to realize the semi-mechanization of transportation, irrigation, and harvesting.

	VII. Strengthen the Prediction and Forecasting of Wheat Diseases and Pests, and Rush to Produce a Large Amount of Pesticides. It is planned to carry out a complete prevention measure during the wheat regreening period.

According to Shaanxi Daily News: In the campaign to achieve a yield of 1,000 jin of wheat per mu, the Chengguan People's Commune in Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, put forward an inspiring fighting slogan: "Ensure a yield of double 1,000 jin per mu, and strive for one crop to exceed one year." In order to realize this wish, the commune party committee adopted the method of grasping the two ends and bringing along the middle in the mass movement during the Great Leap Forward last year. First, they seriously summarized the experience of the key Shuangwang Brigade in carrying out the wheat field management movement, and then held an on-site meeting of cadres above the level of team leader in the entire commune here. Through investigation, viewing, learning, calculation, comparison, and debate, the thinking of all the representatives was further liberated, and "true scriptures" were obtained. As soon as this on-site meeting ended, a new field management movement to "pass the wheat regreening stage well" formed a higher upsurge throughout the commune.

Before the Spring Festival, the Shuangwang Brigade formulated a plan for a wheat yield of 3,000 jin per mu (the total output of this crop is 33 million jin, which is more than three times the total output of 7.8 million jin in the summer and autumn seasons last year). After the Spring Festival, they made this a condition to launch a friendship competition with all the communes and brigades in the province. Then, after rationally arranging labor and solving specific problems, they strengthened leadership. In particular, after formulating technical measures to increase production by passing the "wheat regreening stage" well, they actively started work. Within seven or eight days, they accumulated more than 780 million jin of fertilizer and irrigated the 1,090 mu of wheat with regreening water once. However, some production team cadres did not have as high a confidence in striving for a bumper wheat harvest as the Shuangwang Brigade, so they were soft-hearted towards completing the commune's plan of doubling the yield of wheat per mu to 1,000 jin and striving for one crop to exceed one year. After the commune party committee summarized the experience of the Shuangwang Brigade in detail, it held an on-site meeting in the brigade. More than 2,000 people, including production team leaders, party and league members, wheat high-yield models, farm implement technicians, high-yield plot leaders, and satellite field leaders from the entire commune, visited the growth of large-area wheat satellite fields, "high-yield plots," the "archive system," and the high-yield satellite field of wheat high-yield expert Liu Xijie in the Shuangwang Brigade. Liu Shuxian, a labor model and deputy captain of the Shuangwang Brigade, gave a report to the representatives on how the Shuangwang Brigade achieved a wheat yield of 3,000 jin per mu, and detailed the technical measures they took to pass the wheat regreening stage well.

The above activities were very enlightening to every representative. The visitors all praised the Shuangwang Brigade members for their sufficient drive and great determination. In particular, the representatives were very touched by the Shuangwang Brigade's practice of managing wheat fields like rural girls embroidering flowers, and taking care of wheat seedlings like doctors and nurses taking care of patients. The leader of the Red Star Production Team of Baiyang Brigade said at the group meeting: "After seeing the technical measures of others to pass the wheat regreening stage well, I realized that my work was not enough, and my right-leaning conservative thinking was serious. I only look backward and not forward. I only emphasize difficulties and cannot see the favorable conditions. I must go back and work like the Shuangwang Brigade." Once the right-leaning conservative thinking was resolved, a chorus of "digging potential, thinking of ways, adding measures, and boosting morale" immediately resounded at the on-site meeting. Those with low targets immediately raised them, and those with insufficient measures immediately added them. The wheat yield per mu of the Baiyang Brigade jumped from the original 2,300 jin to 3,500 jin. In addition to resolutely following the "high-yield formula" and "archive system" methods of the Shuangwang Brigade to strengthen the management of the wheat regreening stage, the Chengjia Brigade also wanted to apply more fertilizer. The amount of fertilizer applied per mu before Qingming was increased from two to three times, and from 60,000 jin to 100,000 jin per mu, so as to achieve three irrigations and three fertilizations. The on-site visit and conference not only promoted the backward brigades and led the general brigades to pass the wheat regreening stage, but also greatly promoted the Shuangwang Brigade to further strengthen their wheat field management work. The Shuangwang Brigade decided to effectively implement their technical measures and adopted the "three changes" method, that is, to change first-class fields into satellite fields, change second-class fields into high-yield fields, and change third-class fields into first-class fields. In the regreening stage, all types of wheat fields are required to be upgraded plot by plot, and third-class seedlings must be resolutely eliminated.

After the on-site meeting, a high tide of production quickly appeared. According to statistics: 50,000 laborers in the entire commune were invested in the fertilizer accumulation movement, and a total of more than 7.3 billion jin of high-quality fertilizer was accumulated, searched for, created, and fumigated in eight days, exceeding the county's allocated 1 billion jin fertilizer task by more than six times. The 51,700 mu of wheat fields were topdressed with regreening fertilizer twice; the 10,700 mu of wheat satellite fields were topdressed with regreening fertilizer three times. All wheat fields were harrowed and rolled once, and 15,000 mu of wheat was irrigated with regreening water. Combined with the vigorous campaign to pass the wheat regreening stage well, base fertilizer was also applied to 15,761 mu of cotton fields.

    迈步赶先进　麦田气象新
    渭南城关公社召开现场会议促进麦田管理高潮
    双王大队麦田管理措施
    一、书记挂帅，队长上阵，划分战区，包干负责。由书记、队长率领二十六人，组成麦田管理检查团。组成一百三十三个专业队，专管好麦田。做到层层有专人领导，亩亩有专人负责。一万一千零九十亩小麦进行第三次排队，在清明前，力争一类麦田赶上卫星田，二类麦田赶上丰产田，三类麦田赶上一类麦田。并采取“吃偏饭”“另眼看”的办法，做到一苗不丢，一块不漏。
    二、大搞群众运动。贯彻“两评”（评工级、评工分）、“四定”（定时、定数、定质、定工）和“一奖制”，开展评比竞赛，从制度上保证群众运动的开展。
    三、抓住丰产方，坚持档案制。大队丰产方指挥部贯彻七到田（吃饭、睡觉、办公、开会、学习、文娱、领导等都在田）。并建立队、组、方、段小麦情报网，定点观察记载，定时开会研究，及时解决问题。
    四、及时灌好返青水，施足返青肥。保证小麦穗大粒多，籽粒饱满。
    五、细耙细礳，增强麦田保墒能力。计划一般麦田锄两遍，丰产方锄五遍，拔草两次，作到地无杂草。
    六、在春耕前改革农具五千件，使运输、灌溉、收割实现半机械化。
    七、加强小麦病、虫害的预测预报，大量赶制农药，计划在小麦返青期，要全部预防一次。
    据陕西日报消息　陕西渭南县城关人民公社在开展亩产小麦千斤运动中，提出了一个激励人心的战斗口号：“确保亩产双千斤，力争一料超一年”。为了实现这个愿望，公社党委采用了去年在大跃进中大搞群众运动的抓两头、带中间办法，首先认真总结了重点队双王大队大搞小麦田间管理运动的经验，接着在这里召开了全公社队长以上干部的现场会议，通过查、看、学、算、比、辩，进一步解放了所有代表的思想，取到了“真经”。这个现场会议一结束，新的“过好小麦返青关”的田间管理运动就在全社形成更高潮。
    春节前，双王大队就制定了亩产小麦三千斤的计划（这一料总产量三千三百万斤，要超过去年夏秋两季总产量七百八十多万斤的三倍多）。春节过后，就以这条件向全省各公社大队提出友谊竞赛。接着，合理安排了劳力，解决了具体问题后，加强了领导，特别是制定了过好“小麦返青关”的增产技术措施后，就积极地干起来了，七、八天内积肥七亿八千多万斤，一千零九十亩小麦浇了一次返青水。可是有些生产队的干部，对力争小麦大丰收的信心不像双王大队这样高，因此对完成公社提出的亩产小麦双千斤，力争一料超一年的计划，口硬心软。公社党委在详细总结了双王大队的经验以后，就在该队召开现场会议。全公社生产队长、党、团员、小麦丰产模范、农具手、丰产方负责人、卫星田负责人等共二千多人到双王大队参观了大面积小麦卫星田、“丰产方”、“档案制”和小麦丰产能手刘希杰的高产卫星田的生长情况。劳动模范、双王大队副队长刘述贤向代表们作了关于双王大队如何实现小麦亩产三千斤的报告，并详细介绍了他们过好小麦返青关的技术措施。
    上述活动对每一个代表的启示都很大。参观的人都赞扬双王大队社员的干劲足，决心大。尤其是对双王大队像农村姑娘扎花那样管理麦田，像医生和护士看护病人那样看护麦苗的做法，代表们十分感动。白杨大队红星生产队长在小组会上说：“看了人家过好小麦返青关的技术措施，才知道自己的工作不够，右倾保守思想严重，只向后看，不向前看，只强调困难，看不到有利条件，我回去一定要像双王大队这样干。”右倾保守思想解决了，在现场会上立即响起了一片“挖潜力，想办法，加措施，鼓干劲”的呼声，指标低的马上提高了，措施不足的马上加足了。白杨大队小麦亩产由原来两千三百斤跃进为三千五百斤。程家大队除坚决按照双王大队的“丰产方”和“档案制”办法，加强小麦返青关的管理外，还要多上肥。每亩施肥量在清明前由原来两次增加为三次，每亩由六万斤增至十万斤，作到三水三肥。现场参观大会，不光促进了落后大队和带动了一般大队过小麦返青关，而且还大大促进了双王大队进一步加强他们的小麦田间管理工作。双王大队决定要切实贯彻他们的技术措施并采取了“三变”的方法。即变一类田为卫星田，变二类田为丰产田，变三类田为一类田，在返青关中，要求各类麦田要块块升级，坚决消灭三类苗。
    现场会后，生产高潮很快出现了。据统计：全社有五万名劳力投入了积肥运动，八天内共积、搜、造、熏优质肥料七十三亿多斤。比县分配十亿斤积肥任务超过六倍多。给五万一千七百多亩麦田追了二次返青肥；给一万零七百多亩小麦卫星田追了三次返青肥。所有麦田进行了一次耙耱，一万五千亩小麦浇了返青水。结合大搞过好小麦返青关运动，还给一万五千七百六十一亩棉田施了基肥。
