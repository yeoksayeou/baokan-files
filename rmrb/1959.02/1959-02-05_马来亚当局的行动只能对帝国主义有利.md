Actions of the Malayan Authorities Can Only Benefit Imperialism
Commentator of this newspaper

Recently, the government of the Federation of Malaya verbally notified the Bank of China in Kuala Lumpur that it would cease operations on April 1 this year, based on an amendment to the "Federation Banking Act" passed by the Legislative Council of the Federation of Malaya on December 4, 1958. This amendment stipulates that banks operating in the Federation of Malaya must cease operations within three months of the implementation of this law if 50% or more of their shares are owned by a foreign government, or if a majority of their directors are appointed by a foreign government or its agents. In fact, the Bank of China is the only bank forced to close down due to the "Banking Act" amendment. It is not difficult to see that the Malayan authorities have taken this measure specifically to exclude the institutions of the Bank of China in Malaya. Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the Bank of China, pointed out in a statement issued on December 31, 1958, that the Malayan authorities' forcing the closure of the Bank of China branch is another extremely unfriendly act towards the Chinese people after the Malayan authorities obstructed, restricted, and discriminated against China's trade with Malaya. We cannot help but express our deep regret about this.

China has always attached importance to developing friendly relations with all countries in the world based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, especially with Malaya, which has had contact with China since the 14th century. Overseas Chinese in Malaya have contributed to the development and prosperity of Malaya. The Chinese people have always had deep sympathy for the Malayan people's desire for national independence. When Malaya established the Federation in August 1957, the Chinese government immediately recognized it. China has also always attached importance to restoring and developing trade relations with Malaya on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. In recent years, through continuous struggle, the Malayan people have finally broken through the "embargo" on rubber, thus making Malaya's foreign trade flourish. Various Chinese light industrial products are also popular in the Malayan market. Trade between Malaya and China is not only a matter of traditional Chinese goods needed and liked by Malayan residents, but also adds a lot of income to Malaya's trade. The Bank of China's institutions in Malaya, in the spirit of equality, mutual benefit, and exchange of goods, abide by local laws and operate normal banking businesses. It plays a good and beneficial role in promoting trade between the two countries, supporting the local economy, and enhancing friendship between the two peoples.

However, the Malayan authorities have always adopted a passive attitude towards China's efforts to increase friendly relations and trade relations between the two countries, not only failing to support and make corresponding efforts; on the contrary, they have repeatedly obstructed the development of this relationship. Especially since the second half of last year, the Malayan authorities have adopted a variety of restrictive and discriminatory attitudes towards China's trade with Malaya. At the "Global Exhibition" held in Kuala Lumpur in July last year, the Malayan authorities unreasonably prevented the exhibition of Chinese goods; on October 1, they announced that all importers must obtain special permits when importing Chinese cotton fabrics; four types of Chinese cotton fabrics were prohibited from import, while there were no such restrictions on other countries. Recently, they went even further and forced the institutions of the Bank of China in Malaya to cease operations. These extremely unfriendly actions of the Malayan authorities cannot but make the Chinese people deeply regretful, and cannot but attract the close attention of all those who are concerned about the normal development of international trade.

It needs to be pointed out that the extremely unfriendly actions taken by the Malayan authorities against China are inseparable from the conspiratorial activities of certain imperialists. Everyone knows that imperialism, especially American imperialism, has always relied on creating divisions, contradictions, and discord among the people of Asian and African countries to promote their policy of "using Asians and Africans to fight Asians and Africans." They are most afraid of seeing the development of friendly cooperation and trade relations between Asian and African countries, especially the development of friendly cooperation and trade relations between China and other Asian and African countries. In recent years, with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence increasingly taking root in the hearts of the people, the friendly mutual assistance and cooperation between the people of Asian and African countries have been continuously strengthened; this has made the situation of imperialism, which was already bad, even worse. Especially after the serious failures of the U.S. and British imperialists' armed aggression against the Middle East and the U.S. imperialists' military provocations against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait area, the United States, in order to get rid of its extremely isolated position, has intensified its conspiratorial activities in the Asian and African regions, destroying the normal relations between Asian and African countries, and undermining the unity and cooperation of the Asian and African people. Among the many destructive tricks frequently used by U.S. imperialism, the most common one is to viciously attack China's socialist economic construction and the Great Leap Forward in cultural construction, deliberately misrepresenting the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese people on the industrial and agricultural production fronts as a "threat" to all countries in the world, especially Southeast Asian countries, in an attempt to sow discord between Southeast Asian countries and China's normal relations. Therefore, the Malayan authorities' series of extremely unfriendly actions, such as obstructing, restricting, and discriminating against China's trade with Malaya, and then forcing the Bank of China branch to cease operations, precisely meet the wishes of imperialism. Did the Malayan authorities not see that its extremely unfriendly actions towards China have aroused strong public dissatisfaction domestically, but have won the approval of imperialism abroad? The American "Christian Science Monitor" openly praised "only Malaya has taken preventive action." It is obvious that the Malayan authorities' practice of undermining Sino-Malayan trade can only benefit imperialism, and can never bring any benefits to the Malayan people.

The Malayan authorities have set up artificial obstacles that please imperialism to the normal development of China-Malaya trade, which cannot but extremely seriously affect the future of Sino-Malayan trade. However, the friendly coexistence of the Chinese and Malayan people, and the desire of the two peoples to develop equal and mutually beneficial trade, cannot be stopped by any imperialist force. China has always believed that developing normal international trade is conducive to improving the economic situation of all countries and enhancing mutual understanding and friendly cooperation between countries; and has always made unremitting efforts for this purpose. The exchanges between Malaya and China began in ancient times, and the two sides have traditional friendship and a long history of economic relations. The facts in recent years have proved that the restoration of trade and friendly cooperative relations between China and Malaya is entirely in line with the interests and aspirations of the two peoples. We believe that as long as the Malayan authorities change their current practice, which runs counter to the wishes of the two peoples, and adhere to the principles of international free trade, the friendly cooperation and trade exchanges between China and Malaya will have the possibility of being restored and developing normally.

    马来亚当局的行动只能对帝国主义有利
    本报评论员
    最近，马来亚联合邦政府口头通知我吉隆坡中国银行，于今年4月1日起停止营业；根据是马来亚联合邦立法会议在1958年12月4日通过的一项“联合邦银行法案”修正案。这项修正案规定在马来亚联合邦营业的银行，如股金50％或50％以上属于外国政府所有，或者董事会中多数董事由外国政府或其代理机构所任命，就必须在此项法令实施后三个月内停止营业。事实上，中国银行是受到“银行法”修正案的影响而被迫停业的唯一的银行。这就不难看出，马来亚当局采取这一措施，显然是专门为了排斥我中国银行在马来亚的机构。中国银行董事长南汉宸，在1958年12月31日发表的谈话中已经指出，马来亚联合邦政府迫使中国银行分行停业一事，是马来亚当局在阻挠和限制歧视我国对马来亚贸易之后，对中国人民又一个极不友好的行动。对此，我们不能不表示十分遗憾。
    我国一向重视根据和平共处五项原则，发展同世界各国的友好关系，对于早在十四世纪就开始和中国往来的马来亚，更是如此。我国的侨民，对马来亚的开发和繁荣是有贡献的。我国人民对于马来亚人民的民族独立愿望，一向寄予深切的同情。1957年8月马来亚成立联合邦，不久我国政府就立即予以承认。我国也一向重视在平等互利的基础上恢复与发展同马来亚的贸易关系。几年来，马来亚人民经过不断的斗争，终于突破了橡胶的“禁运”，因而使马来亚的对外贸易得到欣欣向荣的发展。中国的各种轻工业品也在马来亚市场上受到欢迎。马来亚同中国的贸易，不仅是传统性的中国供销品为马来亚居民所需要和喜爱，而且为马来亚的贸易增加了不少收入。中国银行设在马来亚的机构，正是本着平等互利、互通有无的精神，遵守当地法令，经营正常的银行业务的。它对于促进两国贸易及扶持当地经济、增进两国人民的友好，起着良好有益的作用。
    但是，马来亚当局对我国始终采取积极的态度增进两国友好关系和贸易关系，不仅不加以支持和作出相应的努力；相反的，竟一再阻挠这种关系的发展。特别从去年下半年以后，马来亚当局竟对我国马来亚的贸易采取多方限制歧视的态度。去年7月间在吉隆坡举办的“全球展览会”上，马来亚当局无理阻挠中国商品的展出；10月1日，又宣布所有进口商在输入中国棉织品时，必须领取特别许可证；不准四种中国棉织品入口，而对于其他国家却没有这种限制。最近更进而迫使我中国银行在马来亚的机构停业。马来亚当局这种极不友好的行动，不能不使中国人民深为遗憾，也不能不引起一切关心国际贸易正常发展的人们的密切注意。
    需要指出，马来亚当局对我国采取的极不友好的行动，是同某些帝国主义的阴谋活动分不开的。谁都知道，帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义，从来就依靠在亚非各国人民之间制造分裂、矛盾与不和，来推行它们“用亚非人打亚非人”的政策。它们最怕看到亚非各国间友好合作和贸易关系的发展，尤其害怕看到中国同其他亚非国家友好合作和贸易关系的发展。近几年来，随着和平共处五项原则的日益深入人心，亚非各国人民之间的友好互助合作关系不断得到加强；这就使得帝国主义本来已经不妙的处境更加不妙。特别在美、英帝国主义武装侵略中东，以及美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区对中国人民进行军事挑衅遭到严重失败以后，美国为了摆脱它极端孤立的地位，便越发加紧在亚非地区进行阴谋活动，破坏亚非各国间的正常关系，破坏亚非人民的团结和合作。而在美帝国主义经常施展的许许多多破坏伎俩中间，最常见的一种，就是恶毒攻击我国社会主义经济建设和文化建设的大跃进，把我国人民在工农业生产战线上取得的辉煌胜利，别有用心地说成是对世界各国、特别是东南亚各国的“威胁”，企图借此挑拨东南亚各国同中国的正常关系。因而，马来亚当局在阻挠和限制歧视我国对马来亚贸易之后，又迫使我中国银行分行停业等一连串极不友好的行动，恰恰符合了帝国主义的愿望。难道马来亚当局没有看到，它对中国极不友好的举动，在国内引起的反应是公众的强烈不满，在国外却博得帝国主义的采声？美国“基督教科学箴言报”公开赞扬“只有马来亚才采取了制止的行动。”显而易见，马来亚当局这种破坏中马贸易来往的做法，结果只能有利于帝国主义，而决不可能给马来亚人民带来任何好处。
    马来亚当局已为中国—马来亚贸易的正常发展设下了讨好帝国主义的人为障碍，它不能不极端地严重影响到中马贸易的前途。但是，中马两国人民的友好相处，两国人民的要求发展平等互利的贸易往来，毕竟不是任何帝国主义力量所能阻挡得了的。我国一向认为，发展国际间的正常贸易，有助于改善各国的经济状况，增进各国的相互了解与友好合作；并且始终为此进行不懈的努力。马来亚和中国的往来，在久远的年代以前就开始了，双方有着传统的友谊和历史悠久的经济关系。近几年来的事实证明，中马两国的贸易和友好合作关系的恢复，是完全符合两国人民的利益和愿望的。我们相信，只要马来亚当局改变目前这种与两国人民的愿望背道而驰的做法，坚持遵守国际自由贸易的原则，中马两国友好合作和贸易往来就将有可能得到恢复和正常的发展。
