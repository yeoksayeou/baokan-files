Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 14th - The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a radio conference on steel and coal, calling on the people of the province to fight for more steel and coal production. This was a conference filled with triumphant songs of victory, and also a conference announcing new combat missions.

Yang Weiping, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, made an important speech at the meeting. After outlining the great achievements made by Henan Province last year in steel, coal, machinery manufacturing, transportation and other aspects under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, he said that 1959 is a crucial year for the three-year hard battle, and new, greater, better and more comprehensive leap forward tasks have been placed before us.

In order to ensure a great leap forward in steel and coal production, the conference put forward five requirements: First, it is necessary to adhere to putting politics in command, muster greater efforts, and quickly launch a more solid and higher production upsurge. Ensure the production tasks of pig iron and steel in the first quarter. At the same time, actively prepare for steelmaking, seize the basic construction of steel rolling, organize forces to break through key technical barriers, and prepare for mass production of steel in the future. Second, in order to adapt to the needs of the rapid development of steel production, coal, transportation, machinery manufacturing, refractory materials, etc., must rapidly increase production and improve quality. In particular, the production of coking coal and coke is even more important. Therefore, we must focus on coal mining, coal washing, and coke making, and strive to build 300 Red Flag No. 2 coke ovens in the first quarter. Strive to increase the output and quality of raw coal and coke. Third, on the transportation front, we must first ensure the transportation of coal and iron, and secondly, we must fix short-distance transportation forces, so that short-distance transportation and trunk line transportation are closely combined. Fourth, in order to promote a greater leap forward in steel production, it is necessary to closely combine practical work, hard work and skillful work, and vigorously engage in technical revolution. Fifth, we must launch a vigorous upsurge of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced, centered on "increasing production, improving quality, and reducing costs," and promote revolutionary heroism.

Three initiatives were put forward at the radio conference. The initiative of the employees of the 13-cubic-meter blast furnace of the Jiaozuo Zhongzhan United Steel Plant to the blast furnaces of all steel plants in the province is: the output is guaranteed to always reach the design capacity of the blast furnace and strive to exceed it, the daily production of pig iron reaches 13 tons, and strives to break through 20 tons; ensure that all pig iron is gray iron; ensure safe production; and require a further reduction in costs of 10% on the existing basis in the first half of the year. Datong Steel Plant in Xinyang City also put forward an initiative to all employees of local iron-smelting blast furnaces in the province to increase output, quality, and reduce coal consumption. The Liu Jiuxue coal mining team put forward to the coal miners in the province the initiative of "Five Comparisons (comparing indicators, comparing enthusiasm, comparing drilling ability, comparing the promotion of advanced experience, comparing learning); Five Goods (good management, good unity, good propaganda, good observance of labor discipline, good life, recreation, hygiene, and rest); Five Guarantees (guaranteeing high output, high efficiency, low cost, good safety, and good attendance)".

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 14th - The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held an industrial conference to determine the further implementation of the general policy of taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward throughout the province, and to launch a larger, better, and more comprehensive high tide of industrial production.

The meeting conscientiously summarized the experience of implementing the general policy of taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward and carrying out mass movements on the industrial front of the province in 1958. The meeting held that last year, due to the implementation of the policy of taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward, the province not only overfulfilled the steel production tasks assigned by the state and ended the history that Jilin Province could not produce steel; the development of steel production also drove the development of coal, machinery, electricity, timber and other industries, overfulfilled the annual industrial production plan, and steelmaking also cultivated people. More than one million people and more than ten thousand cadres in the province have been well trained in participating in steel production.

The meeting initially arranged the industrial production plan for the whole year and the first quarter of 1959, and decided to mobilize the workers of the province to continue to work hard with soaring enthusiasm to ensure the completion of this year's production tasks of steel, iron, steel and other industrial production plans. The meeting pointed out that the steel production in the first quarter must pass three barriers, namely: improving coke quality, improving steel quality, and reducing costs. At the same time, it is necessary to accelerate the construction of the Tonghua steel base. In order to meet the needs of steel production, the machinery industry must first guarantee the completion of coal washing, coking and metallurgical equipment (including steel rolling, iron making, mining equipment), power station equipment and transportation equipment production tasks according to the principle of guaranteeing the key points and taking care of the general, followed by appropriate arrangements for the production of light industry, building materials and farmland water conservancy equipment, while ensuring complete sets of equipment.

The meeting emphasized: The province must conscientiously implement the policy of "the whole country as one chessboard," resolutely realize the principle of three unifications (unified arrangement of basic construction projects, unified arrangement of production, unified allocation and use of raw materials) and one concession (must give way to key and weak links); continue to strengthen coordination and cooperation, maintain the original cooperative relationship, and establish new cooperative relationships according to production needs.

The meeting held that in order to complete this year's industrial production plan, it is still necessary to conscientiously implement the policy of combining centralized leadership and vigorous mass movements in the future. At present, the main focus of the mass movement should be concentrated on the technical revolution with tool reform as the main content; it is also necessary to popularize, consolidate, and improve small local groups and develop the industry of people's communes. The output value of the industry of people's communes in the province will double this year, and strive to account for 10% of the total industrial output value of the province; in addition, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" policy.

    为多产钢铁煤炭而战
    河南省委举办广播大会发布新的战斗任务
    吉林省委召开工业会议安排今年生产计划
      新华社郑州14日电　中共河南省委最近举办了钢铁、煤炭广播大会，号召全省人民为多产钢铁、煤炭而战。这是一个高奏胜利凯歌的大会，也是发布新的战斗任务的大会。
    中共河南省委书记处书记杨蔚屏在会上作了重要的讲话。他概述了全省人民在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，去年河南省在钢铁、煤炭、机械制造、交通运输等方面取得了巨大的成就以后说，1959年是苦战三年具有决定意义的一年，新的更大、更好、更全面的跃进任务已经摆在我们的面前。
    为了保证钢铁、煤炭生产大跃进，大会提出了五项要求：第一、要坚持政治挂帅，鼓足更大干劲，迅速掀起一个更踏实、更高涨的生产高潮。保证第一季度生铁和钢的生产任务。与此同时，积极做好炼钢的准备工作，抓紧轧钢的基本建设，组织力量突破重点技术关，为今后大量生产钢材作好准备。第二、为适应钢铁生产飞跃发展的需要，煤炭、交通运输、机械制造、耐火材料等，都必须迅速增加产量，提高质量。尤其是焦煤、焦炭的生产更为重要。因此，要抓好采煤、洗煤、炼焦，第一季度要努力建成红旗二号焦炉三百个。努力提高原煤、焦炭的产量和质量。第三、交通战线上，必须首先保证煤铁的运输，其次要固定短途运输力量，以便短途运输和干线运输紧密结合起来。第四、为了促进钢铁生产的更大跃进，需要把实干、苦干和巧干紧密地结合起来，大闹技术革命。第五、要以“提高产量，提高质量，降低成本”为中心，掀起一个蓬蓬勃勃的学先进、赶先进、比先进的热潮，发扬革命的英雄主义。
    在广播大会上提出了三个倡议。焦作中站联合钢铁厂十三立方公尺高炉职工向全省各钢铁厂高炉的倡议是：产量保证经常达到高炉设计能力并争取超过，日产生铁达到十三吨，力争突破二十吨；保证所有的生铁都是灰口铁；保证安全生产；要求上半年在现有基础上再降低成本10％。信阳市大同钢铁厂也向全省炼铁土高炉全体职工提出了提高产量、质量和降低煤耗的倡议。刘九学采煤队向全省煤矿职工提出了“五比（比指标、比干劲、比钻劲、比推广先进经验、比学习）；五好（管理好，团结好，宣传好，遵守劳动纪律好，生活、文娱、卫生、休息好）；五保证（保证产量高、效率高、成本低、安全好、出勤好）”的倡议。
    新华社长春14日电　中共吉林省委最近召开工业会议，确定在全省范围内进一步贯彻以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针，掀起更大更好更全面的工业生产高潮。
    会议认真地总结了1958年全省工业战线上贯彻以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针和大搞群众运动的经验。会议认为，去年由于贯彻执行了以钢为纲，全面跃进的方针，使全省不但超额完成了国家分配的钢铁生产任务，结束了吉林省不能生产钢铁的历史；钢铁生产的发展，又带动了煤、机械、电力、木材等工业的发展，超额完成了全年工业生产计划，而且，炼钢又炼人，全省有一百多万群众和一万多名干部，在参加钢铁生产中都受到较好的锻炼。
    会议初步安排了1959年全年和第一季度的工业生产计划，决定发动全省职工以冲天干劲，继续苦战，确保完成今年的钢、铁、钢材生产任务和其他工业生产计划。会议指出，第一季度的钢铁生产必须过好三关，即：提高焦炭质量，提高钢铁质量，降低成本。同时，要加速通化钢铁基地的建设。为了适应钢铁生产的需要，机械工业必须根据保证重点、照顾一般的原则，首先保证完成洗煤、焦化和冶金设备（包括轧钢、炼铁、矿山设备）、电站设备和运输设备的生产任务，其次是适当安排轻工业、建筑材料和农田水利设备的生产，同时必须保证设备成套。
    会议着重指出：全省要认真贯彻执行“全国一盘棋”的方针，坚决实现三统（统一安排基本建设项目、统一安排生产、统一分配和使用原材料）一让（能为重点和薄弱环节让路的一定要让）的原则；继续加强协作配合，维持原有协作关系，并且根据生产需要，建立新的协作关系。
    会议认为，要完成今年的工业生产计划，今后仍须认真贯彻执行集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的方针，当前要把群众运动的主要锋芒，集中到以工具改革为主要内容的技术革命方面来；还要普及、巩固、提高小土群和发展人民公社的工业，全省人民公社工业的产值今年要翻一番，争取在全省工业总产值中所占的比重达到10％；此外，要认真贯彻“两参一改三结合”的方针。（附图片）
