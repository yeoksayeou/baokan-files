    Compose More Songs for Children
    Yu Xianhai, Wulidun No. 1 High School Iron and Steel Plant, Xinyang, Henan

    One day, several comrades and I went to the nursery of the Datong Iron and Steel Plant. As soon as we entered, a group of innocent and lovely children surrounded us, shouting, "Hello, Uncle!" "Hello, Auntie!" Their silver bell-like voices filled the small courtyard. Afterward, the children sang four songs for us: "Socialism is Good," "I am a Soldier," "We Must Liberate Taiwan," and "The Red Flag is Flying." Looking at their cute faces, I not only envied that they were receiving such good cultural education at such a young age, but also admired their memory, being able to remember so many songs completely. However, I always felt that although these songs have good content, they are more suitable for adults and are not easily understood and accepted by children aged six or seven. Is it possible to compose new nursery rhymes that suit the age characteristics of children? I remember when I was a child, I heard a nursery rhyme in my mother's arms: "Swing, swing, swing to Grandma's bridge, Grandma calls me a good baby..." This summer vacation when I went home, my mother composed a new nursery rhyme: "How strange, how strange, a radish is ridden as a horse, where to ride? To Beijing to report the good news." Similar interesting new nursery rhymes are scattered in folk songs from various places. If they are set to music, the nursery nannies and children will definitely applaud and welcome them.
    Now people's communes across the country are running nurseries. Running nurseries well and enriching children's cultural life is an important task. I hope composers will compose more songs for children that are suitable for them to sing.

    多给孩子们编些歌曲
    河南信阳五里墩一高炼铁厂　于仙海
    有一天，我和几位同志到大同炼铁厂托儿所去，刚一进门，一群天真可爱的孩子围上来，“叔叔好！”“阿姨好！”银铃般的声音响满小小庭院。随后，孩子们给我们唱了四只歌：“社会主义好”、“我是一个兵”、“一定要解放台湾”、“红旗飘扬”。看着他们一个个可爱的面孔，我不但羡慕他们这般年纪就受到这样好的文化教养，而且真佩服他们的记性，原原本本地记住这么多歌子。可是，我总觉得，这些歌子虽然内容挺好，但都是适合成人唱的，并不是六、七岁儿童所能理解和接受的呀。是否可编些适合儿童年龄特点的新儿歌呢？记得，我小时候在母亲怀里听过童谣“摇摇摇，摇到外婆桥，外婆叫我好宝宝……”，今年暑假回家，母亲又编了新歌谣：“希奇真希奇，萝卜当马骑，骑到哪儿去，北京去报喜。”类似这样有趣的新儿歌，散见于各地民歌中，如果谱成曲子，托儿所的阿姨和孩子们定然会鼓掌欢迎的。
    现在全国各地的人民公社都在办托儿所，办好托儿所，丰富儿童的文化生活，这是重要的课题。希望作曲家们，多给孩子们编一些适合他们唱的歌子吧。
