    A Colonial Plan Forced Upon the People of Cyprus
    By Our Correspondent Pan Fei
    The London Round Table Conference on the Cyprus issue concluded on the 19th, with Makarios accepting the Zurich Plan. Ostensibly a discussion, it was in reality a "three-to-one" vote, with Britain imposing the Zurich Plan on the people of Cyprus. Makarios was subjected to intense pressure from Britain, Turkey, and ultimately Greece during the talks. According to London newspapers, Britain set a deadline of 9:45 a.m. on the 19th for Makarios to accept this colonialist plan. Fifteen minutes before the deadline, Makarios agreed to sign the agreement.
    The Zurich Plan guarantees Britain's colonial position in Cyprus. In the south and southeast of the island, Britain maintains seven military bases. Macmillan stated in Parliament on the evening of the 19th: "Our demand is to fully retain British sovereignty over these two areas and to ensure all the rights necessary for these areas to serve as effective military bases. Greece, Turkey, and the Republic of Cyprus should give complete and satisfactory guarantees to these areas; guarantees should be given to us for the necessary rights to use and enjoy these bases." Macmillan did not consider how absurd and confused his logic was when he mentioned the "integrity" of British military bases, the "guarantee" of various privileges, and the "Republic of Cyprus" – all mutually contradictory concepts – in one breath.
    The London Agreement also grants Greece and Turkey broad rights to intervene in Cyprus. According to the agreement, the "security" of "independent" Cyprus will also be "guaranteed" by Britain, Greece, and Turkey. Macmillan said: Britain will "cooperate with Greece and Turkey on the issue of common defense of Cyprus," and "Greek and Turkish troops will also be stationed in Cyprus." According to British newspapers, one of the purposes of stationing Turkish troops in Cyprus is to "prevent the emergence of a left-leaning government in Cyprus."
    Turkey's intervention in Cyprus is already seen as a prelude to turning the island into a military base for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. As soon as the London Agreement was signed, Kucuk, representing Cypriots of Turkish descent (Western news agencies believe he will serve as the vice president of "independent" Cyprus), openly stated that Cyprus might join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Balkan Pact. This is precisely an objective that the United States has pursued for many years.
    The outcome of the London Conference is described as "everyone wins, all are happy." The facts are clear: Britain and Turkey are the ones who benefited, Greece retreated from its consistent position on the Cyprus issue, and the will and demands of the Cypriot people were completely ignored. This is the crux of the problem. The British colonialists and their accomplices are clearly celebrating prematurely if they think they have completed a new deception against the Cypriot people. The Cypriot people, who demand freedom and independence, will not be fooled by this new colonial plan for long.
    The treaty has been signed. For Britain, the next question seems to be: to make "independent" Cyprus join the Commonwealth in order to ensure Britain's continued rule over the island. For the United States, it is to revive the Balkan military alliance and squeeze out British influence in Cyprus. The "New York Herald Tribune" wrote: "The West widely believes that the agreement on Cyprus should allow the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to regain its vitality in one of its most important regions. Moreover, the restoration of Greek-Turkish friendship will give new life to the moribund Greek-Turkish-South Balkan Treaty." This conspiracy of the United States has been confirmed by the speeches of the Greek Prime Minister and the Turkish Foreign Minister. Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis said after the meeting: the results of the London Conference "will undoubtedly help the Balkan Treaty between Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia… Its revival will be very natural. I will discuss this issue with President Tito when I meet with him on March 1st." The Turkish Foreign Minister also stated that the "close and friendly relations" between these three allies "will be re-established."
    The United States has already drawn the curtain. Now, it is time for the Tito clique to come on stage and perform.

### 强加给塞浦路斯人民的殖民计划

    强加给塞浦路斯人民的殖民计划
    本报记者  潘非
    讨论塞浦路斯问题的伦敦圆桌会议19日结束了，马卡里奥斯接受了苏黎世方案。名义上是讨论，实际上是“三比一”的表决，英国将苏黎世方案强加于塞浦路斯人民的身上。马卡里奥斯在会谈过程中受到了来自英国、土耳其，以及最后来自希腊的强大压力。据伦敦报纸透露，英国把19日上午九点四十五分作为马卡里奥斯接受这一殖民主义方案的最后期限。在这限定时间到来以前十五分钟，马卡里奥斯表示同意在协定上签字。
    苏黎世方案保证了英国在塞浦路斯的殖民地位。在这个岛屿的南部和东南部，英国保持了七个军事基地。麦克米伦19日晚在议会发言时说：“我们的要求就是在这两个地区完全保留英国的主权以及保证这些地区在作为有效的军事基地时所必要的一切权利。希腊、土耳其和塞浦路斯共和国，应该给予（这些基地的）地区完整的满意保证；应该给予我们使用与享有这些基地的必要权利的保证。”麦克米伦没有想一想：当他一口气提到英国军事基地的“完整”，各种特权的“保证”，以及“塞浦路斯共和国”这些互相矛盾的概念时，他的逻辑是多么荒唐和混乱。
    伦敦协定还给予希腊和土耳其干涉塞浦路斯的广泛权利。根据协定，“独立”后的塞浦路斯的“安全”，还将受到英、希、土的“保证”。麦克米伦说：英国将在“共同防御塞浦路斯问题上同希、土合作，同时，希腊和土耳其的军队还将进驻塞浦路斯。据英国报纸透露，土耳其军队的进驻塞浦路斯的目的之一是为了“防止塞浦路斯出现左倾的政府”。
    土耳其的插足于塞浦路斯，已被认为是把这个岛屿变为北大西洋集团的军事基地的前奏。伦敦协定刚一签署，代表土耳其血统的塞浦路斯人的库楚克（西方通讯社认为他将担任“独立”后的塞浦路斯的副总统）就公开说，塞浦路斯可能加入北大西洋集团和巴尔干条约。而这正是美国多年来所追求的一个目的。
    伦敦会议的结果，被说成是“四全其美，皆大欢喜”。事实很清楚，占到便宜的是英国和土耳其，希腊则从它一向在塞浦路斯问题的立场上退却了，而塞浦路斯人民的意志和要求被完全忽视。这正是问题的关键所在。英国殖民者和它的同伙如果以为他们对塞浦路斯人民已完成了一个新的骗局，显然是高兴得早了一些。要求自由和独立的塞浦路斯人民是不会被这个新的殖民方案蒙蔽多久的。
    条约已经签订了。对英国来说，下一步的问题似乎是：使“独立”的塞浦路斯参加英联邦，以保证英国对这个岛屿的继续统治。对美国来说，是复活巴尔干军事联盟，以及排挤英国在塞浦路斯的势力。“纽约先驱论坛报”写道：“西方广泛认为，关于塞浦路斯问题的协议应该使得北大西洋组织在其最重要的一个地区恢复元气。而且希土友谊的恢复将给予奄奄一息的希土南巴尔干条约以新的生命。”美国的这一阴谋，已为希腊首相和土耳其外交部长的发言所证实。希腊卡拉曼利斯首相在会后说：伦敦会议的结果，“无疑地将对希腊、土耳其和南斯拉夫的巴尔干条约有所帮助。……它的复活，将是很自然的。3月1日我同铁托总统会谈时，将讨论这一问题。”土耳其外长也表示，这三个盟国“亲密和友谊的关系将重新建立。”
    美国已经拉开了幕布。现在，该铁托集团出场唱戏了。
