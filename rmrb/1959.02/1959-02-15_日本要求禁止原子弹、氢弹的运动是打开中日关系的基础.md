Xinhua News Agency, February 14th - Yasui Kaoru's speech at the welcome meeting, titled: The Japanese Movement to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is the Foundation for Opening Sino-Japanese Relations – A Report to Chinese Friends – The full text is as follows:

Dear friends: I have long cherished the enthusiastic desire to visit China. This time, thanks to the kind invitation of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, my wish has come true. I am very happy to meet you all, my friends, during this auspicious Spring Festival.

As I said in my speech upon arrival at Beijing Airport: I have come to your country as a representative of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs (Gensuikyo) and the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations (Hidankyo) to express our respect and gratitude to the Chinese people and their government. At the same time, I am here to report on the situation of the anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb movement in Japan, and as comrades in the peace movement, to discuss with you all future joint actions by the Chinese and Japanese peoples. I am very grateful for your warm welcome and the holding of such a grand gathering.

In New China, the liberated 600 million people are giving full play to their productivity and creativity, making great construction achievements and demonstrating a remarkable leap forward. We are watching all of this with respect.

We also express our deep respect for the unremitting efforts made by the Chinese people and their government for world peace. We only need to think about the role China played in the establishment of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference to know how great China's contribution to world peace is.

These practices of China, both domestically and internationally, are all developing on the basis of correct theory. In particular, the theories presented by Chairman Mao Zedong in his "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" and many other works are not only the highest guidelines for the Chinese people, but also a treasure house from which people of all countries can learn valuable lessons.

We sincerely hope that the people's communes of the Chinese people will be successful, thereby opening up a path to a more glorious future and becoming the central force for world peace.

Dear friends,

The Chinese people have sent representatives to the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and have provided enthusiastic support and cooperation through all other means for the Japanese people's movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs. This has made a great contribution to the development of the anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb movement in Japan. Here, on behalf of the Japanese people participating in the anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb movement, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Chinese people.

The Chinese people have also extended a warm hand to the victims of the Japanese atomic and hydrogen bombs, offering condolences. Seven organizations, including the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, The All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China, the All-China Federation of Youth, the Red Cross Society of China, and the China Relief Association, have donated huge amounts of relief funds to the victims of atomic and hydrogen bombs in the name of the Chinese people every year since 1955.

The Japanese victims of atomic and hydrogen bombs have been encouraged, first of all, spiritually by the warm condolences of the Chinese people. These precious donations are being used to treat the victims of atomic and hydrogen bombs; to build welfare facilities in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Tokyo, and other places; and to cover the organizational activities of atomic and hydrogen bomb victim groups; as well as for other meaningful work expenses.

The Japanese relief movement for victims of atomic and hydrogen bombs has developed both domestically and internationally, thanks to the warm concern of the Chinese people. Under these sympathies and encouragement, a girl from Hiroshima, who was affected by the atomic bomb disaster, said with emotion, "It's still good to be alive!" Here, on behalf of the Japanese victims of atomic and hydrogen bombs, I once again express my deep gratitude to the Chinese people.

Dear friends!

Please allow me to take this opportunity to report to you on the history, current situation, and future development trends of the Japanese movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs.

The atomic bombs dropped by the United States on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 instantly took the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Most of them were non-combatants, and many children tragically lost their lives.

The Japanese people initially felt extremely terrified by this cruel weapon of mass destruction against humanity, but soon this sense of terror transformed into intense anger. At that time, the American occupation imposed strict restrictions on the Japanese people, but the Japanese people did not succumb to American suppression. They expressed their opposition to atomic and hydrogen bombs through various means.

The most obvious example of this was in 1950, when the Stockholm Appeal to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs was issued, Japan collected six million signatures. Although this number is not too large, it is a fact that occurred under the dangerous situation of the Korean War. These precious signatures were collected while fighting against the bloody suppression of the United States, so they are historically significant.

I would also like to cite an example of a special case of protesting the cruelty of the atomic bombing through the art of painting. The Japanese painters Iri Maruki and Toshi Maruki painted the tragic scene of Hiroshima as "Hiroshima Panels." They resisted American oppression and traveled all over the country to hold mobile exhibitions.

The Marukis visited China with the "Hiroshima Panels" two years ago and were warmly welcomed by Chinese friends. This time, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations sent the paintings by the Marukis as a small gift to the Chinese people. This is because we believe that the works of Japanese artists fighting against American imperialism will surely be loved by Chinese friends.

After years of accumulation, the above-mentioned resistance and struggle led to the rise of the Japanese people's anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb activities, taking the Bikini Atoll hydrogen bomb test incident as a starting point, becoming a nationwide mass movement.

On March 1, 1954, the hydrogen bomb test conducted by the United States on Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands caused its atomic ash to fall on the peaceful fishing boat "Daigo Fukuryu Maru (Lucky Dragon 5)" which was fishing in the Pacific Ocean at that time. Twenty-three crew members were poisoned by radiation, and one of them, Mr. Aikichi Kuboyama, was killed. This third tragedy after Hiroshima and Nagasaki shows that even hydrogen bomb tests conducted in a peaceful environment also take people's lives.

Due to this Bikini incident, the anger of the Japanese people finally erupted. Like a long-blocked water flow breaking through the dam, it surged forward thousands of miles. This torrent of people's anger was also the signature movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, with the total number of signatures soaring to 35 million.

The signature movement calling for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs, which began in Japan, spread widely to various countries around the world after the World Peace Council issued the Vienna Declaration in January 1955. At that time, more than 400 million Chinese people signed their names, and the Japanese people gave this a high evaluation. The joint actions taken by the people of various countries for peace, especially the joint actions of the Chinese and Japanese peoples, were successfully put into practice in the form of a signature movement. As comrades in the peace movement, we are very happy with our Chinese friends.

Dear friends,

The Japanese movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, which developed from the signature movement, has flourished year by year with the strong support and cooperation of the people of various countries, led by the Chinese people. The Japanese people's understanding of the atomic and hydrogen bomb issue has also become increasingly profound.

Chairman Mao Zedong rightly pointed out in "On Practice" that people's understanding develops from a lower to a higher stage, from a perceptual to a rational stage, through practice. At the same time, Chairman Mao also cited the example of the Chinese people's understanding of imperialism. It went through the stage of perceptual understanding reflected by the xenophobic struggles such as the Taiping Rebellion and the Boxer Rebellion, and then rose to a higher stage in the May Fourth Movement in 1919, when it began to truly understand the essence of imperialism. Chairman Mao's argument is equally applicable when observing the development process of the Japanese people's understanding of the atomic and hydrogen bomb issue.

In the early stages of the anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb movement, the Japanese people demanded the prohibition of this cruel weapon of mass destruction against humanity because of their hatred of atomic and hydrogen bombs. However, from the practice of the anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb movement, the Japanese people clearly realized who possesses atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, who is preparing for atomic war, and who is undermining world peace and human happiness.

We believe that the "Vienna Declaration" is not only an appeal to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, but also an appeal to "oppose preparations for atomic war," which points out a clear direction for the anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb movement. This declaration is a driving force for the development of the Japanese anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb movement to a higher stage.

In August 1957, the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs was held in Tokyo. This World Conference clearly stipulated that its basic task was "to resolutely fight against the atomic strategic system." After serious discussions among the delegates from various countries and from all over Japan, the historically significant "Tokyo Declaration" was adopted and issued.

The Chinese delegation, headed by Mr. Cai Tingkai, made a great contribution to the success of the Third World Conference. I would like to take this opportunity to report to you that when Mr. Cai Tingkai came to Japan, he was affectionately welcomed by the Japanese people as "the amiable and approachable general." This means that a general from a peace-loving country is not a "terrible" figure to the masses of people in other countries.

Judging from the world situation since the Third World Conference, it is very correct to take "resolutely fighting against the atomic strategic system" as the basic task of the Third World Conference. After 1958, as the forces of peace began to overwhelm the forces of war, the imperialists desperately resisted, and they frantically promoted activities to strengthen the atomic strategic system. In Europe, the nuclear armament of West Germany, which occupies an important position politically and militarily, is a concrete manifestation.

In the Far East, the imperialists are promoting a military bloc plan piecing together Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, transporting nuclear weapons and missiles into these regions, and have already begun to arm the armies of these countries with nuclear weapons. This is an open act of hostility towards the people of Asian countries, especially the Chinese people, and it is also an act that exacerbates the tension in the Far East.

When the United States began to provoke in the Taiwan Strait, it was the most tense time in the Far East. At that time, the American fleet and troops were all dispatched from the Japanese mainland and Okinawa. From this incident, we can clearly see the role Japan plays in the American strategic system in the Far East. This not only seriously threatens peace in the Far East, but is also extremely dangerous for the Japanese people themselves.

The Japanese people will never be willing to let their country fall into such a dangerous situation. The Japanese people do not want to be hostile to any country, and at the same time, they will never allow other countries to use Japan for their strategic purposes.

Based on this awareness of the Japanese people, the Japanese movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs has been further developed. In the summer of 1958, more than one million people participated in the 1,000-kilometer peace march between Hiroshima and Tokyo. Subsequently, the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs was held in Tokyo, with 5,000 delegates from various countries and all over Japan participating in the conference.

The Chinese delegation, which had attended the conference every year since the First World Conference and made great contributions to the success of the conference, was unable to attend the Fourth World Conference last year. This was an unfortunate consequence of the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards China, for which the Japanese people deeply regret. At the same time, the Japanese people sincerely appreciate that the Chinese people held a conference in China to enthusiastically support and respond to the convening of the Fourth World Conference. Despite the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards China, the joint actions taken by the Chinese and Japanese peoples to defend peace were still successfully put into practice in this way.

At the Fourth World Conference, Ms. Chieko Watanabe, an atomic bomb survivor from Nagasaki, was carried onto the stage by her mother. Ms. Watanabe is a young girl who suffered from hemiplegia, an incurable disease, due to the American atomic bomb disaster thirteen years ago. She cannot walk or even stand on her own. She said the following to the delegates from various countries and all over Japan:

"If Japan conducts nuclear armament, then Japan will change from the only country in the world that has suffered from atomic and hydrogen bomb disasters to a country that harms people. Who is nuclear armament for? If it is aimed at China, as an atomic bomb survivor – I will never allow it. After the Second World Conference held in Nagasaki, I was very happy to be able to see close friends from various countries again, but today I am very sad that I could not see my Chinese friends at this conference. Let us build a Japan where Chinese friends can visit with joy as soon as possible!"

Ms. Watanabe's words are the true voice of the atomic bomb survivors, and at the same time sharply expose the essence of the nuclear armament policy. And it clearly pointed out that stopping nuclear armament is the basis for opening the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations.

As soon as Ms. Watanabe finished speaking, the venue immediately resounded with stormy applause. Her words were also used in the conference declaration.

In order to implement the resolutions of the Fourth World Conference, it was decided to launch an "International Joint Action Month" centered on November 1. During this action month, various countries carried out various activities. In Japan, the masses of people held peaceful demonstrations and parades against American military bases and Self-Defense Force bases. Such a large-scale demonstration and parade was the first in Japan. Once the anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb movement develops to such a concrete level, it will inevitably be violently countered by forces that do not like this movement. This counterattack is manifested in relying on the police and other state power to suppress democracy. Because we foresaw this situation, whether it was the peace march between Hiroshima and Tokyo or at the Fourth World Conference, we raised the banner of defending democracy while opposing nuclear armament.

The movement carried out under the banner of defending democracy played a great role. Shortly after the World Conference, when the Kishi Nobusuke government attempted to forcibly amend the "Police Duties Execution Law," the movement to defend democracy united with other democratic and peace forces to crush this attempt by the Kishi Nobusuke government. This is a great victory for the Japanese mass movement.

Through the struggle against nuclear armament and in defense of democracy, the Japanese people's understanding has been deepened. When we discuss who is trying to forcibly carry out nuclear armament? Who is trying to suppress democracy? The Japanese people gradually clearly realized that the root cause is American imperialism and the latent Japanese imperialism colluding with it.

From this it can be seen that Mr. Guo Moruo's speech at the Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference held in Stockholm in July 1958 is worth pondering. In his speech, Mr. Guo Moruo emphasized that the responsibility of the peace movement is to clarify the root of the war plague, so that people all over the world clearly know that its root is imperialism, especially American imperialism.

At the same time, Mr. Guo Moruo spoke with extremely cautious attitude the following paragraph:

"We are not against the American people, nor are we against America. What we are against is the root of war – the American policy of arms expansion and war preparation and the policy of aggression, the Cold War policy that serves the super-profits of a few people. We hope that American policy will be more sensible and change that policy, which is not only for the happiness of the people of the world, but also for the happiness of the American people. What's wrong with everyone living together peacefully after being liberated from that policy?"

Mr. Guo Moruo's paragraph clearly points out the current tasks and boundaries of the peace movement. His paragraph is in line with the current situation of the Japanese movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs. I support Mr. Guo Moruo's statement. As long as we correctly understand Mr. Guo Moruo's paragraph, then I believe that no one will oppose his statement from the standpoint of the peace movement.

Dear friends,

What kind of process has the Japanese movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs gone through to develop to this day? Based on the above report, you should be able to understand something about this. In the future, we will continue to move forward on the basis of the achievements of the past movement.

There are still some important issues on our path: namely, to strive to implement the agreement on the conclusion of a permanent and unconditional ban on atomic and hydrogen bombs proposed at the Geneva Conference, and there are other important issues. This year, we believe that the basic line of the movement in Japan is: to stop the revival of Japanese imperialism and militarism, symbolized by the development of nuclear armament; to liberate the Japanese mainland and Okinawa from the American imperialist atomic strategic system, and to move towards a path of peaceful neutrality. This basic line is closely related to the issue of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and the opening of Sino-Japanese relations.

The day before I left Japan to visit China, that is, on February 5th, five organizations, including the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution, the National Conference for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, the National Liaison Conference Against Military Bases, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, issued a joint statement calling on the people of the country to actively take action to launch a joint struggle for "opposing the revision of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, abolishing the treaty, and opening up Japan-China relations." Recently, the People's Daily reported to the Chinese people that this movement is developing smoothly.

We have designated February 28, the day when the Japan-U.S. Administrative Agreement was signed, as the "National People's Unified Action Day" to launch the movement. A national congress will be convened in Tokyo on this day. The power of the people shown in the struggle against the revision of the Police Duties Execution Law last autumn will be gathered again on this day to further strengthen and advance.

The next day, March 1, is the fifth anniversary of the Bikini disaster. On that day, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs will hold a "Japan Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and Preventing Nuclear Armament" in Yaizu, the port where the disaster-stricken fishing boat Daigo Fukuryu Maru belongs, which is also the location of the tomb of Aikichi Kuboyama, the victim. Many gatherings with the same purpose will be held throughout the country that day.

Chinese friends who deeply care about the Japanese movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs may also ask us: "How will the Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs be held?" Here I will explain the draft of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs on this issue.

This August, we will welcome representatives from all over the world to hold the Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Hiroshima, the world's first city to suffer an atomic bombing. At this conference, it is estimated that there will be about 10,000 Japanese representatives from all over the country. Due to such an arrangement, for foreign representatives, the conference is a place for them to directly contact the Japanese mass movement; for the Japanese people, the conference is also a place for them to learn from the experience and absorb the opinions of foreign representatives. At this conference, there will be discussions at a higher level on issues such as the recent changes in the world situation and the development of the movement. We eagerly look forward to this conference passing a declaration and resolutions that are more progressive than the Fourth World Conference.

In order to gather as many people as possible in Hiroshima, including the representatives participating in the Fifth Conference, we are planning to hold a "Peace Pilgrimage" for people from all over the world to come to Hiroshima, as well as a "Peace March" from all over Japan to Hiroshima. Last year, we gained experience not only in peace marches held in Japan, but also in other countries. We will use these methods to further develop the experience we have gained.

In addition, we have also planned several activities.

In general, including these plans, we will promote a grand review of the forces of peace in Hiroshima this August. This is our draft. We sincerely hope that the Chinese people will give us frank criticism of our draft. We hope to absorb the opinions of comrades in the peace movement from all over the world, led by you Chinese friends, so as to make the most perfect plan.

This year is an extremely important year for the world peace movement. Under the situation of "the East Wind prevails over the West Wind" as Chairman Mao said, this year's peace movement must give a decisive blow to the forces of war. Our plan, centered on the Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, is to serve this purpose. We hope that people from all over the world, especially the Chinese people, can take joint action with us Japanese people.

As mentioned earlier, due to the Kishi Cabinet's policy of hostility towards China last year, the Chinese delegation was unable to participate in the Fourth World Conference. We must strive to get the Chinese delegation to participate in this year's Fifth World Conference. We swear to you Chinese friends that we will do our best to create the preconditions for its realization.

Dear friends!

Before my report comes to an end, please allow me to talk to you about the Japanese people's reflection and determination.

In the past, Japanese imperialism and militarism invaded China, causing unspeakable pain and sorrow to the Chinese people. We are conducting a serious reflection on this issue. Even today, more than ten years after the end of the war, the pain and condemnation in our conscience have not disappeared.

The Chinese people have very generously said to us that this crime is the crime of Japanese imperialism and militarism, not the crime of the Japanese people. Even so, we believe that we must never feel at ease because we have received these kind words. We should also stand in our own position to atone for the past sins.

What should we do to atone for our sins? This cannot be just apologizing and repenting to China in words, but we must use action to stop the revival of Japanese imperialism and militarism, to crush the attempt to nuclear arm Japan; to liberate the Japanese mainland and Okinawa from the control of the American imperialist atomic strategic system; to establish friendly relations between a peaceful and neutral Japan and China. Only by doing this can we atone for our sins.

The basic line of the Japanese movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs is moving in this direction. I have already said this before. Imperialist elements may hinder our movement, but we believe in the great power of the masses of people, and we also believe in the great power of science. We firmly believe that as long as we combine the enthusiasm and power of the masses of people with scientific analysis, our movement will be able to overcome all obstacles and achieve brilliant victory!

As the ancient Chinese fable says, this is "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains." The two mountains of imperialism and militarism, a considerable part of which are already collapsing and cracking, will one day disappear completely on the ground as people all over the world make unremitting efforts and take joint action for the cause of peace under the guidance of correct theory.

    日本要求禁止原子弹、氢弹的运动是打开中日关系的基础
    ——向中国朋友的报告——
    安井郁在欢迎大会上的讲话
    新华社14日讯　安井郁在欢迎大会上的讲话，题：日本要求禁止原子弹、氢弹的运动是打开中日关系的基础——向中国朋友的报告——全文如下：
    诸位亲爱的朋友们：我在很久以前就热情地想到中国来访问，这次承蒙中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的亲切的招待，我的希望实现了。在这可喜的春节中同诸位朋友见了面，内心感到非常高兴。
    如像我在到达北京机场时致词中所说的那样：我到贵国来，是代表日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会和日本原子弹氢弹受害者团体协议会，向中国人民及其政府表达我们的敬意和谢意，同时向大家报告日本禁止原子弹氢弹运动的情况，并作为和平运动的同志，同诸位朋友一道来商谈今后中国人民和日本人民的共同行动问题。诸位朋友热情地欢迎我，还召开了这样盛大的集会，我是非常感激的。
    在新中国，解放了的六亿人民，他们的生产力和创造力正被充分地发挥着，做出伟大的建设成绩和表现出惊人的跃进局面，所有这些，我们都怀着尊敬的心情在注视着。
    我们同时也对中国人民和他们的政府对世界和平所作的那种不懈的努力，表示深切的敬意。我们只要想到和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则的成立过程中，中国所起的作用，仅这一点，就能知道：中国对世界和平所作的贡献是多么巨大。
    中国在国内方面和国际方面的这些实践，一切都是在正确的理论基础上发展着的。特别是毛泽东主席在他的“实践论”和“矛盾论”及其他许多著作中所提示的理论，它不仅对中国人民来说是最高的指针，它也是世界各国人民能够从中学取宝贵教训的一个宝库。
    我们由衷地期望：中国人民的人民公社获得成功，并由此开辟走向更加光辉的未来道路，成为世界和平的中心力量。
    亲爱的朋友们：
    对于日本国民要求禁止原子弹氢弹的运动，中国人民曾经向禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会派遣代表，并尽了其他一切办法给予热烈的支援和合作。这对日本的禁止原子弹氢弹运动的发展作了很大的贡献。我在这里仅以参加禁止原子弹氢弹的日本国民的名义，向中国人民致以恳切的谢意。
    中国人民还对日本的原子弹氢弹受害者伸出了温暖的手，给予慰问。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国亚非团结委员会、中华全国总工会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会、中华全国青年联合会、中国红十字会总会、中国人民救济总会等七个团体，以中国人民的名义，从1955年以来，每年向原子弹氢弹受害者捐赠了巨额的救济金。
    日本的原子弹氢弹受害者们，由于得到中国人民温暖的慰问，他们首先在精神上受到了鼓舞。这些珍贵的捐款，正被用作治疗原子弹氢弹的受害者；建设广岛、长崎、东京等地的福利设施；并用作原子弹氢弹受害者团体的组织活动的开支；以及其他各种有意义的工作经费。
    日本的对原子弹氢弹受害者的救援运动，由于中国人民温暖的关怀，在国内、国际方面都获得了发展。在这些同情和鼓励之下，广岛有个受原子弹灾害的女孩子感动地说“还是活着的好啊！”在这里，我代表日本的原子弹氢弹受害者们，再一次向中国人民致以深厚的感谢。
    诸位亲爱的朋友们！
    请允许我借这个机会，向诸位报告一下日本禁止原子弹氢弹运动的历史和现状以及今后的发展动向。
    1945年8月美国在广岛、长崎投下的原子弹，瞬息之间夺去了数十万人的生命。其中大部分是非战斗的人员，许多孩子悲惨地丧失了生命。
    日本国民对这个残酷的大规模屠杀人类的武器，起初感到十分恐怖，但不久以后这种恐怖心理，转化成为强烈的愤怒，当时美国的占领对日本国民加以严格限制，但日本国民并没有在美国的镇压下屈服，他们通过各种各样的方式表明反对原子弹氢弹的意志。
    其中最明显的事例是：1950年当斯德哥尔摩发出禁止原子弹氢弹的宣言时，日本收集到六百万人的签名，虽然这个数字并不算太多，但是这是处在朝鲜战争险恶的形势下发生的事实，这是同美国的血腥镇压进行斗争的情况下收集得来的珍贵的签名，所以它是具有历史意义的。
    我还想举个事例，这是通过图画这门艺术，对原子弹轰炸的残酷性进行抗议的特殊例子。日本的画家丸木位里、丸木俊子夫妇俩将广岛的惨景画成“原子轰炸图”，他们一面抵抗美国的压迫，一面奔波全国各地，举办了流动展览会。
    丸木夫妻在前两年曾带着“原子轰炸图”来到中国访问，受到中国朋友的热情欢迎。这次日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会和日本原子弹氢弹受害者团体协议会，作为对中国人民的微薄的礼物，送来了丸木夫妻画的图画。这是因为我们相信：向美帝国主义进行斗争的日本艺术家的作品想必会受到中国朋友的喜爱的。
    前面说过的种种反抗和斗争经过数年累积，后来日本人民的反对原子弹氢弹的活动，以比基尼岛氢弹试验事件为起点高涨起来，成为全民性质的群众运动。
    1954年3月1日，美国在马绍尔群岛中的比基尼岛上进行的氢弹试验，它的原子灰吹落到当时在太平洋上捕鱼的和平渔船“福龙丸第五号”上，二十三名船员受到放射性的毒害，其中的一人久保山爱吉先生被害死了。这一继广岛长崎之后发生的第三个悲剧，说明即使在和平环境下进行氢弹试验，它同样地夺去了人们的生命。
    由于这一比基尼事件，日本人民的愤怒终于爆发了。如同长期被围堵的水流冲破堰堤一样，一泻千里地前进。这个人民的愤怒的洪流，也正是禁止原子弹氢弹的签名运动，签名的总人数激增到三千五百万人。
    在日本开始的要求禁止原子弹氢弹的签名运动，到1955年1月在世界和平理事会发出维也纳宣言之后，在全世界各国广泛发展起来，那时候中国人民有四亿多人签了名，日本人民对此给予很高的评价。世界各国人民为和平所采取的共同行动、特别是中国人民和日本人民的共同行动，以签名运动的方式，出色地得到了实践。我们作为和平运动的同志，和中国朋友一道感到很高兴。
    亲爱的朋友们：
    由签名运动开始发展的日本要求禁止原子弹氢弹的运动，在以中国人民为首的世界各国人民的强有力的支持与合作之下，一年年地蓬勃发展着，日本人民对于原子弹氢弹问题的认识，也越来越深刻了。
    毛泽东主席在实践论中很正确地指出：人们的认识是通过实践，从低级发展到高级阶段；从感性发展到理性阶段的。同时毛主席还举例说中国人民对帝国主义的认识，是经过太平天国运动和义和团运动等笼统的排外主义的斗争所反映的那个感性认识的阶段，然后到1919年“五四”运动，才上升到高级阶段，开始真正认识帝国主义的实质。毛主席的这个论点，在观察日本人民对原子弹氢弹问题的认识发展过程时，同样是适用的。
    在禁止原子弹氢弹运动的初期，日本人民群众由于憎恨原子弹氢弹而要求禁止这种残酷的大规模屠杀人类的武器。但是，从禁止原子弹氢弹运动的实践过程中，日本人民很清楚地认识到，究竟是谁掌握原子武器、氢武器，是谁准备原子战争，是谁来破坏世界和平和人类幸福。
    我们认为“维也纳宣言”不仅是禁止原子弹氢弹的呼吁书，而且也是“反对准备原子战争”的呼吁书，它指出了禁止原子弹氢弹运动的明确方向。这个宣言是促使日本的禁止原子弹氢弹运动发展到更高阶段的一个推动因素。
    1957年8月间，在东京举行了第三届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会。这个世界大会明确地规定了它的基本任务是“对原子战略体系进行坚决的斗争”，经过到会的各国代表同来自日本全国各地的代表们的认真讨论之后，通过和发表了具有历史意义的“东京宣言”。
    以蔡廷锴先生为首的中国代表团，为第三届世界大会的成功，作出了很大的贡献。我谨借今天这个大会的机会，向各位朋友报告一下，当蔡廷锴先生到日本的时候，被日本人民群众称为“和蔼可亲的将军”，而受到日本人民的亲切欢迎。这意味着爱好和平的国家的将军，对于其他国家的人民群众来说并不是“可怕”的人物。
    从第三届世界大会以后的世界形势来看，以“对原子战略体系进行坚决斗争”作为第三届世界大会的基本任务是非常正确的。到了1958年以后，随着和平力量开始压倒战争势力，帝国主义者拼命地进行反抗，他们疯狂地推进加强原子战略体系的活动。在欧洲，无论是政治上军事上都占重要地位的西德的核武装就是一个具体表现。
    在远东，帝国主义者正在推进把日本、台湾、南朝鲜等拼凑在一起的军事集团计划，把核武器和导弹运进这些地区，并且已经开始用核武器武装这些国家的军队。这是对亚洲各国人民，特别是对中国人民的公开的敌对行为，而且也是加剧远东紧张局势的行为。
    美国开始在台湾海峡进行挑衅的时候，是远东局势最紧张的时候。当时美国的舰队和军队都是从日本本土和冲绳岛调遣去的，由这件事情，我们可以很清楚地看到日本在美国远东的战略体系中所起的作用。这不仅是严重地威胁着远东的和平，而且对于日本人民本身也是极其危险的。
    日本人民绝对不会甘心让自己的祖国陷入这样危险的境地。日本人民不愿敌视任何国家，同时也绝对不允许其他国家为了它的战略目的而利用日本。
    在日本人民这种觉悟的基础上，日本的禁止原子弹氢弹运动得到了更进一步的发展。1958年夏天一百万以上的人民群众参加了当时举行的广岛、东京之间一千公里和平大游行，其后，在东京举行了第四届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会，来自世界各国和日本全国各地的五千名代表参加了这次大会。
    自从第一届世界大会以来，每年都来参加大会，并且为大会的成功作出巨大贡献的中国代表去年没有能够参加第四届世界大会。这是由于岸信介政府执行敌视中国政策带来的不幸后果，对此，日本人民深感遗憾。同时日本人民衷心地感谢，中国人民为热烈支持和呼应第四届世界大会的召开，而在中国举行了一个大会。尽管岸信介政府采取敌视中国的政策，中国人民和日本人民为保卫和平而采取的联合行动，在这样的方式之下，仍然得到了出色的实践。
    在第四届世界大会上，长崎的一个原子弹受害者，渡边千惠子女士由她母亲抱着上了讲台，渡边女士是一个年轻的姑娘，在十三年前因受美国原子弹的灾害，患了半身不遂的不治之症，她自己不能走路，甚至自己不能站起来。她向来自世界各国和日本全国各地的代表们，讲了下面一段话：
      “如果日本进行核武装的话，那么日本将由世界上唯一受原子弹氢弹灾害的国家变成害人的国家。核武装是为了攻击谁呢？如果是针对中国的话，作为一个原子弹受害者——我，决不允许的。在长崎召开的第二届世界大会之后，我能够再一次见到从各国来的亲密的朋友们，感到非常高兴，但是，今天在这个大会上没能够看到中国的朋友，使我非常难过。让我们早日建立一个中国朋友们也能够带着高兴的心情而来访的日本吧！”
    渡边女士的这段话是原子弹受害者心里的真实的呼声，同时也尖锐地揭穿了核武装政策的本质。并且明确地指出了阻止核武装是打开中日关系僵局的基础。
    渡边女士一讲完话，会场里马上响起了暴风雨般的掌声。大会宣言中也采用了她的这段话。
    为了实现第四届世界大会的决议，决定以11月1日为中心，开展“国际联合行动月”，世界各国在这个运动月当中，进行了各种各样的活动，在日本举行了反对美国军事基地和自卫队基地的人民群众的和平示威游行。这样大规模的示威游行在日本来说还是头一次。禁止原子弹氢弹运动一发展到这样具体化，就必然会遭到不喜欢这个运动的势力的猛烈反击。这种反击表现在依靠警察和其他国家权力来压制民主。因为我们预见到这种形势，所以无论是在广岛——东京之间的和平大游行或在第四届世界大会上，我们在反对核武装的同时还高举着保卫民主的旗帜。
    在保卫民主的旗帜下进行的运动起了很大的作用。在世界大会后不久，当岸信介政府企图强行修改“警察官职务执行法”的时候，保卫民主的运动就同其他民主力量和和平力量联合起来，粉碎了岸信介政府的这种企图。这就是日本的群众运动获得的巨大胜利。
    通过反对核武装和保卫民主的斗争，加深了日本人民的认识。当我们讨论究竟是谁企图强行核武装？究竟是谁企图压制民主的时候，日本人民逐渐清楚地认识到其根源就是美帝国主义以及和它勾结在一起的潜在的日本帝国主义。
    由此可见，郭沫若先生1958年7月在斯德哥尔摩举行的裁军和国际合作大会的发言，是值得我们深思的。郭沫若先生在发言中强调指出：和平运动的责任是阐明战争瘟疫的根源，让全世界人民都明确地知道其根源就是帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义。
    同时，郭沫若先生以极其慎重的态度讲了以下一段话：
      “我们并不是反对美国人民，也不是反对美国，我们所反对的是战争根源——美国的扩军备战政策和侵略政策，为少数人的超额利润服务的冷战政策。我们希望美国政策更明智一些，改变那种政策，那不仅是为了世界人民的幸福，同时也是为了美国人民的幸福。从那种政策中解放出来，大家和平共处有什么不好呢？”
    郭沫若先生的这段话，很明确地指出了目前和平运动的任务和界线。他的这段话是符合于目前日本禁止原子弹氢弹运动的情况的。我拥护郭沫若先生的这种说法。只要正确地理解到了郭沫若先生的这段话，那么我相信不会有人站在和平运动的立场上反对他的说法。
    亲爱的朋友们：
    日本的要求禁止原子弹、氢弹的运动，经过了怎样的过程才发展到今天，关于这点，根据以上的报告，各位想必能有所了解。今后我们还要在过去运动的成果的基础之上，继续前进。
    我们的前途上，还有这样一些重要课题：即要争取使日内瓦会议上提出的关于缔结永久和无条件禁止原子弹和氢弹的协定付诸实现，还有其他一些重要课题。而今年，我们认为日本的运动的基本路线是：阻止以发展核武装为象征的日本帝国主义、军国主义的复活；使日本本土及冲绳岛从美国帝国主义的原子战略体系中解放出来，走向和平中立的道路。这条基本路线，同日美安全保障条约问题及打开中日关系等问题，有着密切的关系。
    在我从日本出发访问中国的前一天，即2月5日，日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会、拥护宪法国民联合会、恢复日中邦交国民会议、全国反对军事基地联络会议、日本工会总评议会等五个团体，发表一项共同声明，号召全国人民积极行动起来为“反对改恶日美安全保障条约、废除该条约、打开日中关系”而展开共同斗争。最近的人民日报，曾向中国人民报道：这一运动正在顺利地发展。
    我们把签订日美行政协定的那一天，即2月28日，定为展开运动的“全国人民统一行动日”，这一天要在东京召集国民大会。去年秋天反对修改警察官职务执行法的斗争中所表现出来的人民大众的力量，在这天要再一次汇集起来，进一步壮大前进。
    第二天，即3月1日，正是比基尼受灾事件的第五周年纪念日，在那天日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会将要在受灾渔船第五福龙丸所属的港口、也就是牺牲者久保山爱吉的坟墓所在地——烧津，召开一个“反对原子弹氢弹和阻止核武装的日本大会”。到那天全国各地还会召开许多同一目的的集会。
    对日本要求禁止原子弹氢弹运动寄予深切关心的中国朋友们也会问我们：“第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会将怎样进行呢？”在这里我就这个问题，说明一下日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会的草案。
    今年8月我们要在世界最初遭受原子弹轰炸的都市广岛，迎接世界各国的代表召开第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会，在这次大会来自全国各地的日本代表，预定约有一万人。由于这样一个安排、对外国代表们来说，大会是他们直接接触日本群众运动的场所；对日本人民来说，大会也是他们向外国代表们学习经验和吸取意见的场所。在这次大会中将就最近世界形势的变化和运动的发展等问题，进行更高水平的讨论，我们热心地期待这次大会将通过较第四届世界大会更为前进的宣言和决议。
    我们为了尽量使包括参加第五届大会的代表在内的更多的人们聚集到广岛，我们正在筹划举行全世界人们来到广岛的“和平巡礼”，以及日本全国各地向广岛的“和平大游行”。去年我们不但在日本、在其他各国所举行和平游行中得到了经验，我们将运用这些方法进一步发展已得的经验。
    此外，我们也计划了几项活动。
    总起来，包括这些计划在内，今年8月我们要在广岛推进一个和平力量的大检阅。这就是我们的草案，我们热诚地希望中国人民对我们草案给予直率的批评，我们希望能吸收以各位中国朋友为首的世界各国的和平运动同志们的意见，以便作出最完善的计划。
    今年对世界和平运动来说是个极为重要的一年。在毛主席所说的“东风压倒西风”的形势下，今年的和平运动必须对战争势力给予决定性的打击。以第五届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会为中心的我们的计划，也就是要为这个目的而服务。我们希望世界各国人民，尤其是中国人民，能够和我们日本人民在一道，采取共同的行动。
    如前面所说，去年由于岸内阁敌视中国的政策，第四届世界大会没有能够获得中国代表的参加，今年的第五届世界大会，我们一定要争取中国代表来参加。我们向各位中国朋友宣誓，我们要尽全部力量，来努力创造促其实现的前提条件。
    各位亲爱的朋友！
    在我的报告将结束之前，请允许我向大家谈谈作为日本人民的反省和决心。
    在过去，日本帝国主义和军国主义侵略了中国，使中国人民遭受了无可言喻的痛苦和悲哀，对于这个问题，我们对自己进行着严肃的反省。即使在战争结束以来已有十多年的今天，我们良心上的痛苦和谴责，仍然没有消失。
    中国人民非常宽厚地向我们说，这个罪是日本的帝国主义和军国主义的罪，不是日本人民的罪。尽管那样，我们认为我们决不能因为得到这些善意的话，而心安理得。我们也应该站在我们自己立场上赎清过去的罪。
    我们为了赎罪，应该怎样去做呢？这不能只是在口头上向中国道歉谢罪，而是我们要用行动，来阻止日本帝国主义和军国主义的复活，来粉碎日本核武装化的企图；把日本本土及冲绳岛从美帝国主义原子战略体系的控制中解放出来；使和平中立的日本同中国之间建立起友好关系。只有这样做，才是我们赎罪的道路。
    日本的要求禁止原子弹氢弹运动的基本路线，是朝着这个方向前进的。这在前面我已经说过了。帝国主义分子可能要阻挠我们的运动，但是我们相信人民大众的伟大力量，同时我们也相信科学的伟大力量。我们坚定地相信：只要把人民大众的热情和力量同科学的分析结合起来，我们的运动一定能够排除一切障碍，取得辉煌的胜利！
    如像中国古代的寓言所说，这是“愚公移山”。帝国主义和军国主义这两座大山，现在它的相当大的部分已经在倒塌崩裂，全世界人民在正确的理论指导下，为和平事业进行不懈的努力和共同行动，这两座大山终有一天会在地面上完全消失的。
