Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 14th:  Novotný, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and President of Czechoslovakia, said at a meeting of party cadres attended by 15,000 people in Prague on the 12th: "The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a great support and inspiration for our struggle and work for the happiness and peaceful life of mankind."

Novotný emphasized that the working people of Czechoslovakia unanimously agreed with the conclusions reached at the CPSU Congress.

Novotný then said that the 21st Congress of the CPSU was evidence of a new victory for Marxism-Leninism, and its results were a crushing defeat for all the false theories of revisionism and the failure of the reformism of the Social Democratic Party.

Novotný emphasized the importance of combating modern revisionism. He also said that our struggle against the Yugoslav revisionists does not weaken our friendly feelings towards the fraternal nations of Yugoslavia. In the future, Czechoslovakia will also conduct state-to-state cooperation and maintain trade relations with Yugoslavia on issues where views are the same.

Speaking on international issues, Novotný said that all the working people of Czechoslovakia demanded the immediate conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

Novotný said that the 21st Congress of the CPSU once again demonstrated the complete support of the socialist world for the anti-imperialist struggles of those countries that are striving to break away from colonialism and those that have already gained independence and want to follow their own path of progress.

Novotný stressed that certain theoretical issues of Marxism-Leninism discussed by Comrade Khrushchev are of inestimable value to us and other fraternal parties.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 14th:  Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, said in Berlin on the evening of the 13th that the 21st Congress of the CPSU guaranteed the peaceful future of mankind, and that the Soviet Union was striding ahead of mankind in realizing the magnificent program of communist construction.

Ulbricht pointed out that the 21st Congress of the CPSU put forward an important argument, namely that even before socialism has completely triumphed in the world, and while capitalism still exists in parts of the world, there will be a practical possibility of eliminating the danger of world war from human society. In this regard, Ulbricht expressed his support for the Soviet Union's proposal on concluding a peace treaty with Germany and peacefully resolving the Berlin issue. He said: The treaty makes the call for "Germans to sit down at the same table" a practical matter: jointly consult on the draft treaty.

Ulbricht made these remarks at a meeting of activists from the Greater Berlin region of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany held in Berlin.

Speaking of the world communist movement, Ulbricht said that the invitation of seventy-two communist and workers' parties to attend the congress illustrated the consolidation and strength of the world communist movement. The declaration of the communist and workers' parties of socialist countries published in November 1957 was unanimously endorsed by all communist and workers' parties and has become the charter of international solidarity of the world communist movement. Revisionism has not been able to lead any communist party away from the path of Marxism-Leninism. The argument of the revisionists that capitalism has another nature and that it will gradually transform into socialism has been refuted in reality.

Ulbricht said that on the issue of opposing imperialism and striving for peace, we will do our best to cooperate with Yugoslavia on issues where our views coincide, and further develop trade relations between countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

Ulbricht called on party members to seriously study Khrushchev's report and hold special lectures and discussions in factories, scientific institutions, and rural areas to discuss the issues raised at the 21st Congress of the CPSU with non-Party working people.

    诺沃提尼乌布利希谈苏共二十一大意义
    马克思列宁主义的新胜利
    人类和平事业的重大保证
    据新华社布拉格14日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记、捷克斯洛伐克总统诺沃提尼12日在布拉格举行的一次有一万五千人出席的党的干部会议上说：“苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会，对我们为人类谋求幸福与和平生活的斗争和工作，是一个巨大的支持和启发。”
    诺沃提尼强调说，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民一致同意苏共这次代表大会所作出的结论。
    诺沃提尼接着说，苏共第二十一次代表大会是马克思列宁主义取得新的胜利的证据，它的结果是修正主义一切虚伪理论的惨败和社会民主党的改良主义的失败。
    诺沃提尼强调了对现代修正主义进行斗争的重要性。他还说，我们对南斯拉夫修正主义者的斗争并不削弱我们对南斯拉夫各个兄弟民族的友好感情。将来，在某些问题上，凡是彼此的观点将相同的，捷克斯洛伐克还要同南斯拉夫进行国家之间的合作以及保持贸易关系。
    诺沃提尼在谈到国际问题时说，捷克斯洛伐克全体劳动人民要求立即缔结对德和约。
    诺沃提尼说，苏共第二十一次代表大会再次显示了社会主义世界完全支持那些正在争取摆脱殖民主义的国家以及那些已经获得独立而要走自己的前进道路的国家的反帝斗争。
    诺沃提尼着重指出，赫鲁晓夫同志所谈到的某些马克思列宁主义的理论问题对我们和对其他兄弟党都具有不可估量的价值。
    据新华社柏林14日电　德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希13日晚在柏林说，苏共第二十一次代表大会保证了人类和平的未来，苏联在实现共产主义建设的宏伟纲领方面大踏步地走在人类的最前列。
    乌布利希指出，苏共第二十一次代表大会提出了一个重要的论点，即甚至在社会主义还没有在全世界完全胜利以前，在资本主义还在世界部分地区继续存在的时候，就会出现把世界大战的危险从人类社会中消除掉的实际可能性。在谈到这一点的时候，乌布利希表示支持苏联关于缔结对德和约与和平解决柏林问题的建议。他说：和约使“德国人坐到一张桌子旁来”这个呼吁具有实际的内容：共同磋商和约草案。
    乌布利希是在柏林举行的德国统一社会党大柏林地区积极分子会议上说这番话的。
    乌布利希在谈到世界共产主义运动时说，七十二个共产党和工人党应邀参加代表大会，这件事说明了世界共产主义运动的巩固和强大。1957年11月所发表的社会主义国家共产党和工人党宣言得到了所有的共产党和工人党的一致赞同，并且已成为世界共产主义运动国际团结的宪章。修正主义并没有能使任何一个共产党脱离马克思列宁主义的道路。修正主义者认为资本主义已具有另一种性质，它将逐步地转变成社会主义，这种论调已在现实生活中被驳倒了。
    乌布利希说，在反对帝国主义和争取和平的问题上，凡是彼此的观点相吻合的，我们将尽力同南斯拉夫合作，并且在平等和互利的基础上进一步发展国与国之间的贸易关系。
    乌布利希号召党员们认真学习赫鲁晓夫的报告，并在工厂、科学机关和农村中举办专门的讲座和讨论会，在那里同非党劳动人民一起讨论苏共第二十一次代表大会上所谈到的问题。
