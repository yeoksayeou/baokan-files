Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: More than thirty Japanese people's organizations, responding to the call of the Japan Peace Committee, will jointly hold the "Abolish the Security Treaty, Promote Peaceful Coexistence Japan Peace Congress" in Tokyo on February 27th and 28th.

This conference will determine the basic direction of Japan's peace movement this year. The conference will discuss the issue of realizing the common goals of all peace forces in Japan. These goals are: realizing Japan's neutralization and adopting a policy of peaceful coexistence; concentrating all democratic and peaceful forces to launch an active struggle against the U.S.-Japan reactionary forces; preventing the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and striving to abolish it; restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China; concluding a Japan-Soviet peace treaty; strengthening solidarity with Asian and African countries; banning the testing and use of nuclear weapons; and promoting the holding of an East-West summit conference, etc.

Approximately two thousand representatives from all sectors of Japanese society, including workers, farmers, youth, students, women, culture, and religion, will participate in this important conference. Currently, more than thirty regions, including Osaka, Fukuoka, Gunma, Aichi, Mie, and Tottori prefectures, have already held peace activist meetings and are making various preparations for the successful holding of this peace conference.

This peace conference is the beginning of a large-scale national movement by the Japanese people to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and realize peaceful neutrality. At the same time, various Japanese people's organizations will also jointly hold a "National Congress to Break the Security Treaty System and Restore Diplomatic Relations between Japan and China" in Tokyo on the 28th, with 30,000 participants. After the meeting, a large-scale demonstration will be held.

On March 1st, the fifth anniversary of the Japanese fishing boat "Lucky Dragon" being harmed by the American hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Atoll in the Pacific, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs will hold the "Fifth Anniversary of Bikini Victims, Ban Nuclear Weapons, Prevent Japan's Nuclear Armament Conference" in Yaizu City, Shizuoka Prefecture.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: Due to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's refusal to abandon its plan to pursue nuclear armament, negotiations between the Japan Socialist Party and the Liberal Democratic Party regarding the passage of a resolution on Japan's non-nuclear armament by the Diet finally broke down today.

In today's negotiations, the two parties decided to submit separate draft resolutions to the Diet regarding the prohibition of Japan's nuclear armament.

Under pressure from the Socialist Party and public opinion, the Nobusuke Kishi group was once forced to agree to the Diet passing a resolution on the prohibition of Japan's nuclear armament on the 16th. However, when negotiating the content of the draft resolution in the past two days, the Liberal Democratic Party resorted to deceptive tactics. It insisted on writing in the resolution that Japan "does not possess nuclear weapons that threaten other countries," attempting to create a legal basis for Japan to possess "non-threatening" nuclear weapons, in order to achieve the goal of nuclear armament. The Socialist Party opposed this tactic and insisted that the resolution clearly stipulate that Japan "does not possess any nuclear weapons." However, the Liberal Democratic Party insisted on its deceptive stance, and therefore the negotiations finally broke down.

The Socialist Party stated today that it will pursue the responsibility of Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi in the Diet regarding the breakdown of negotiations. (Attached picture)

    要求废除日美“安全条约”和实现日本的和平中立
    日本数十团体将举行和平大会
    社会党和自由民主党关于日本非核武装问题的谈判破裂
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本的三十多个各界人民团体响应日本和平委员会的号召，将在2月27日和28日在东京联合举行“废除安全条约、促进和平共处日本和平大会”。
    这次大会将决定日本和平运动今年的基本方针。大会将就实现日本所有和平力量的共同目标的问题进行讨论，这些目标是：实现日本中立化和采取和平共处政策；集中一切民主、和平力量向美日反动势力展开积极斗争；阻止修改日美“安全条约”并争取废除这项条约；恢复日中邦交；缔结日苏和约；加强同亚非各国的团结；禁止试验和使用核武器；促使举行东西方首脑会议等。
    日本的工人、农民、青年、学生、妇女、文化、宗教等全国各界的约二千名代表将参加这次重要的大会。目前，大阪、福冈、群马、爱知、三重、鸟取县等三十多个地方已经举行了和平积极分子会议，并且正在为胜利举行这次和平大会进行着各种准备工作。
    这次和平大会是日本人民即将展开的声势浩大的废除日美“安全条约”、恢复日中邦交、实现和平中立的全民性运动的开端。与此同时，日本各人民团体还将在28日在东京联合举行有三万人参加的“打破安全条约体系、恢复日中邦交国民大会”，会后将举行声势浩大的示威游行。
    在3月1日日本渔船“福龙丸”在太平洋比基尼岛遭受美国氢弹试验祸害五周年这天，日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会将在静冈县烧津市举行“比基尼受害五周年、禁止核武器、阻止日本核武装大会”。
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：由于执政的自由民主党不肯放弃进行核武装的计划，日本社会党同自由民主党关于由国会通过日本非核武装决议的谈判，今天宣告最后破裂。
    在今天的谈判中，两党决定将分别向国会提出关于禁止日本进行核武装的决议案。
    岸信介集团在社会党和舆论的压力下，曾经被迫同意由国会在16日通过关于禁止日本核武装的决议。但是在这两天谈判决议草案的内容时，自由民主党又玩弄偷天换日的手法。它主张在决议案中写成日本“不保有威胁别国的核武器”，企图制造法律根据使日本可以保有“不威胁别国”的核武器，以达到进行核武装的目的。社会党反对这种手法，主张在决议案中明确规定日本“不保有一切核武器”。但自由民主党坚持它的欺骗立场，因而谈判最后破裂。
    社会党今天表示，它将在国会中就谈判破裂问题追究日本首相岸信介的责任。（附图片）
