    Demand Socialism From Time
    Yao Renwei
    Before me, every day unfolds a moving scene of gongs and drums, fluttering red flags, and millions of people enthusiastically engaged in the upsurge of digging soil and opening canals. I personally witnessed two youth teams launching a labor competition against each other, and I especially remember one of their slogans: "Demand socialism from time." What an inspiring and militant slogan! Here, people are working from dawn till dusk on the Ganfu Plain water conservancy project. Three months ago, it was still a vast expanse of wilderness, but it changes day by day, as if a great magician has suddenly transformed it into a long river gradually stretching into the distance. At this moment, I further understood the meaning of the phrase "Demand socialism from time": first, socialism itself will not fall from the sky out of thin air, but must be obtained through the diligent labor of people, like they are doing now with soaring enthusiasm and a down-to-earth approach; second, time does not wait for people, but must be seized by people themselves.
    Yes, time is wealth, and time is truly too precious for our generation.
    Consider: the countless steelworkers standing day and night by the converters, sweating and toiling, are doing so to seize time; the hundreds of millions of peasant brothers working diligently in the fields, braving wind and rain, toiling under the stars and moon, are doing so to seize time; the fundamental issue of the general line of socialist construction in our country, developing at a high speed, is the issue of winning time to the greatest extent; fighting hard for three years, this year is the decisive year, and it is also a matter of seizing time.
    Time is so precious and so important to us, but the key to determining time lies in our people.
    Listen to the heroic words of our worker comrades regarding time: "Heroic ambition soars to the sky, ordering production to ride a rocket, it's laughable that time is late, I've already crossed the year 1962."
    Listen again to the action slogans of our peasant brothers: "Seize sunny days, grab cloudy days, treat windy and drizzly weather as good weather; start early and work late to make it half a day, use gas lamps as if it were daytime."
    This is not to say that people do not need rest and sleep, but to illustrate that time must be seized. In the past year, steel production reached 11 million tons, coal production reached 270 million tons, grain reached 750 billion jin, and cotton reached 67 million dan. This victory is also a victory of seizing time. There is no doubt that these unprecedented developments on the industrial and agricultural fronts are inspiring us to welcome new and greater victories.
    Let us seize more new things every day, and let seizing time become a regular part of everyone's life! The Party instructs us that in order to realize the 1959 national economic plan, we must continue to oppose conservatism, break down superstitions, advocate daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, exert full effort, and strive for the upper reaches. At the same time, we must earnestly advocate practical, hard, and skillful work, advocate "ten parts target, twelve parts measures," and advocate practical calculation, arrangement, and inspection. The more this is the case, the more we must treat time with careful calculation, not letting go of a single minute or second!

    向时间要社会主义
    姚人为
    在我的面前，每天呈现着锣鼓喧天、红旗招展、千万人热火朝天地卷入挖土开渠热潮的动人场面。我曾亲眼看到两个青年队互相挑起劳动竞赛，他们有一句口号特别使我记得牢：“向时间要社会主义”。这是多么富有鼓动性战斗性的口号呵！这里人们起早落晚进行的就是赣抚平原水利工程。三个月前还是一片空旷的原野，以后一天一个样，真像有个大魔术师似地一下子把它变成为逐渐向着远方伸展的一道长长的河流了。这时我也才进一步理解“向时间要社会主义”这一句话的含义：第一、社会主义本身不会凭空从天上掉下来，而是要人们像现在那样干劲冲天、脚踏实地的辛勤劳动才能得到；第二、时间是不等待人的，而是要人自己去争取。
    是的，时间就是财富，时间对于我们这一代人来说实在是太宝贵了。
    请看：日日夜夜站在转炉旁挥汗苦战的千千万万钢铁工人为的是争取时间；风雨无阻、披星戴月辛勤劳动在田野上的亿万农民兄弟为的是争取时间；我国社会主义建设总路线，高速度地发展，根本问题就是最大限度地赢得时间的问题；苦战三年，今年是决定性的一年，也是争取时间问题。
    时间对于我们是那么宝贵那么重要，但决定时间的关键在于我们的人。
    请听听我们的工人同志对于时间所发出的豪语吧：“英雄志气冲破天，命令生产坐火箭，可笑时间来得晚，我已跨过六二年。”
    再听听我们的农民兄弟的行动口号吧：“抓晴天，抢阴天，大风细雨当好天；起早摸黑当半天，汽灯底下当白天。”
    这并不是说人不需要休息和睡眠，而是说明时间必须争夺。过去的一年里，钢的产量达到了一千一百万吨，煤的产量达到了二亿七千万吨，粮食达到了七千五百亿斤，棉花达到了六千七百万担。这个胜利，也就是争取时间的胜利。毫无疑问，在工农业战线上的这些史无前例的发展，正在鼓舞着我们迎接新的更伟大的胜利。
    让我们每天都夺得更多新的东西吧，让争取时间成为我们每个人的生活常规吧！党指示我们为了实现1959年国民经济计划，一定要继续反对保守，破除迷信，提倡敢想敢说敢做，鼓足干劲，力争上游。同时，要认真提倡实干苦干巧干，提倡“十分指标，十二分措施”，提倡切实的计算、安排和检查。愈是这样，愈要精打细算地来对待时间，不放过一分一秒！
