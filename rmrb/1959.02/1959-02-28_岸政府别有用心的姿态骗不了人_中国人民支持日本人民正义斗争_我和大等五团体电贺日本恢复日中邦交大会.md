Xinhua News Agency, February 27th: The China Peace Committee and four other people's organizations said today in a congratulatory telegram to the Japan National Convention for Breaking the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" System and Restoring Japan-China Diplomatic Relations that the Japanese people from all walks of life's struggle to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and achieve a completely independent, peaceful, and neutral Japan is entirely just. The Chinese people fully support this just demand of the Japanese people and all their struggles to this end.

    The telegram, jointly signed by the China Peace Committee, the Asian-African Solidarity Committee of China, the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, the All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China, and the All-China Youth Federation, said: "The Chinese people have always held a friendly attitude towards the Japanese people and have made unremitting efforts to promote friendship between the two peoples. Due to the Kishida Nobusuke government's pursuit of a policy of hostility towards China by following U.S. imperialism, the relationship between China and Japan is in a very abnormal state. At present, the Kishida Nobusuke government's attitude of hostility towards China has not changed. Under these circumstances, the various gestures made by the Kishida Nobusuke government only prove that it has ulterior motives. However, this absolutely cannot deceive the people of China and Japan. The convening of your convention is the best proof. We believe that the Japanese people's continued campaign to demand that the Kishida Nobusuke government change its policy of hostility towards China and be friendly with China will help the mutual understanding between the peoples of China and Japan and promote the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan. The Chinese people also fully support all the efforts made by the Japanese people to this end."

    The telegram said: "The Japanese people's struggle is just. It not only conforms to the vital interests of the Japanese people but also conforms to the common interests of defending peace in Asia and the world. We believe that the Japanese people, who once dealt a heavy blow to the Kishida Nobusuke government's conspiracy to revise the 'Police Duties Execution Law' to pave the way for the revival of militarism, will surely achieve greater victories in the struggle against the war conspiracies of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and for peace and friendship."

    The congratulatory telegram also expressed cordial greetings and respect to the Japanese people and congratulated the convention on its success.

    岸政府别有用心的姿态骗不了人
    中国人民支持日本人民正义斗争
    我和大等五团体电贺日本恢复日中邦交大会
    新华社27日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会等五个人民团体今天在致日本打破日美“安全条约”体系、恢复日中邦交国民大会的一份贺电中说，日本各阶层人民要求废除日美“安全条约”和实现一个完全独立的、和平中立的日本的斗争，完全是正义的。中国人民完全支持日本人民这一正义的要求和他们为此所作的一切斗争。
    这份由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国亚非团结委员会、中国人民外交学会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会和中华全国青年联合会等五个人民团体联合署名的电报说：“中国人民一贯对日本人民抱着友好的态度，并为促进两国人民间的友好作了不懈的努力。由于岸信介政府追随美帝国主义，采取敌视中国的政策，使中日两国间的关系处于非常不正常的状态。目前，岸信介政府敌视中国的态度并没有改变，在这种情况下，岸信介政府所做的种种姿态，只能证明它是别有用心而已。但是，这绝对欺骗不了中日两国人民，贵大会的召开，就是最好的证明。我们相信，日本人民继续开展要求岸信介政府改变敌视中国的政策、同中国友好的运动，将有助于中日两国人民间的互相了解，和促进中日两国间正常关系的恢复。中国人民也完全支持日本人民为此而作的一切努力。”
    贺电说：“日本人民的斗争是正义的，它不仅符合日本人民的切身利益，而且也符合保卫亚洲和世界和平的共同利益。我们相信，曾经对岸信介政府为复活军国主义铺平道路而修改‘警察官职务执行法’的阴谋给予沉重打击的日本人民，一定能够在反对美日反动派的战争阴谋、争取和平和友好的斗争中，获得更大的胜利。”
    这份贺电还向日本人民表示亲切的问候和敬意，并且祝贺大会成功。
