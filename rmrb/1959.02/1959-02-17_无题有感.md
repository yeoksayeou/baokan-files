Reflections on a Nameless Poem
Zhong Huai

    Failure is a test for people—a test of whether, when facing setbacks and sacrifices, your will becomes depressed or even more determined.

    Victory is also a test—a test of whether, amidst praise and cheers, you become dizzy and elated, or even more humble and cautious.

    Difficulties within victory are yet another test—a test of whether you can distinguish between the main current and the tributaries, differentiate between the nine fingers and the one finger; and whether you dare to overcome temporary difficulties and win even greater victories.

    Coldness comes in various forms.

    What is combined with and complements enthusiasm is calmness.

    Only cold, never hot, and insulated from warmth is indifference, apathy, standing idly by, and sarcastic remarks.

    When someone emphasizes coldness to you, please first clarify the meaning of coldness in their dictionary.

    When someone emphasizes enthusiasm to you, please first investigate whether they themselves have been enthusiastic in the past and whether they still have any enthusiasm now.

    失败对人是一种考验——考验你面对着挫折和牺牲，是意志消沉还是意志更加坚定。
    胜利也是一种考验——考验你在一片赞美和喝彩声中，是昏昏然飘飘然，还是更加谦虚和谨慎。
    胜利中的困难，又是一种考验——考验你能不能分清主流和支流，区别九个指头和一个指头；敢不敢战胜一时的困难，赢得更大的胜利。
    冷，有各种各样。
    同热情结合、相辅相成的是冷静。
    只冷不热、与热绝缘的是冷淡、冷漠、冷眼旁观、冷言冷语。
    当有人向你强调要冷的时候，请先弄清在他的字典里冷的含义。
    当有人向你强调要热的时候，请先考察一下他自己过去是不是热过，现在还有没有热气。
