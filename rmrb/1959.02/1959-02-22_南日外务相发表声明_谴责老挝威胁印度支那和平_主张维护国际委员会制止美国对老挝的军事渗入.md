Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 21st – North Korean Foreign Minister Nam Il issued a statement today saying that the government and people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea strongly condemn the American imperialist intervention in Laos and firmly oppose the provocative actions of the Kingdom of Laos government, instigated by American imperialism, in unilaterally declaring that Laos is not bound by the Geneva Accords.

The statement said that the declaration by Lao Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone on February 11, announcing that Laos was no longer bound by the Geneva Accords, is a challenge to peace in Indochina.

The statement said that there is no doubt that Sananikone's provocative statement was made under the manipulation of American imperialism.

The statement said that we advocate that, in order to stop American military infiltration into Laos, maintain and consolidate peace in Indochina, and promote the complete independence of Laos, the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos must be maintained and its smooth operation guaranteed.

The statement said that if the Kingdom of Laos government does not fulfill the Geneva Conference agreements regarding the Laotian question and does not guarantee the activities of the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos, then the Kingdom of Laos government and the American government that manipulates it shall be responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom.

    新华社平壤21日电　朝鲜外务相南日今天发表声明说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和人民强烈谴责美帝国主义对老挝的干涉，并且坚决反对老挝王国政府在美帝国主义的唆使下片面宣布老挝不受日内瓦协议约束的挑衅行为。
    声明说，老挝王国首相培·萨纳尼空在2月11日发表的宣布老挝不再受日内瓦协议约束的声明是对印度支那和平的挑战。
    声明说，毫无疑问，萨纳尼空发表这一挑衅性的声明，是在美帝国主义操纵下发表的。
