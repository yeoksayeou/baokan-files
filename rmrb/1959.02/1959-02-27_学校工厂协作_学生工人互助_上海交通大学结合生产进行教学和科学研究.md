School-Factory Collaboration: Students and Workers Help Each Other
Shanghai Jiaotong University Integrates Production with Teaching and Scientific Research

(Our report) Shanghai Jiaotong University recently summarized its teaching work and concluded that collaborating with relevant factories according to departments and specializations to conduct scientific research and design and manufacture new products is a good way to combine teaching with productive labor. It can supplement the shortcomings of school-run factories and not only improve the quality of teaching but also provide factories with strong technical assistance.

Jiaotong University is a comprehensive engineering university. Although it has five factories on campus, including machinery manufacturing, metallurgy, transportation and hoisting machinery, shipbuilding, and electrical machinery, they are small in scale and can only be used as training grounds for basic skills for lower-grade students, or to research and produce a small number of products. This is insufficient to meet the needs of senior students engaging in in-depth theoretical exploration and the research of large, advanced, precision, and cutting-edge products. Last year, in implementing the educational policy of combining teaching with productive labor, senior students who had studied basic theory courses and some specialized courses urgently requested to engage in productive labor in factories and to combine it with teaching and scientific research. They learned and worked simultaneously in their labor. Some helped factories design and manufacture new products, treating the factories as the school's experimental workshops. They used the factory's relatively complete equipment and technical conditions to study advanced and cutting-edge technologies, closely integrating theoretical research with production, and achieving good results. Fifth-year students and some teachers from the Shipbuilding Department, after completing the "Shipbuilding Technology" and "Ship Equipment Systems" courses at the Hudong Shipyard, cooperated with the factory's technical cadres and workers to successfully research and develop sixty-five new technologies, greatly improving labor productivity and improving the working conditions of workers. Eighty-eight students were recognized as advanced collectives attending the Second National Congress of Active Builders of Socialism for Youth. Fourth- and fifth-year students and teachers from the Transportation and Hoisting Machinery Department participated in the design work of factories and related research units at the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, and Xiangtan Electrical Machinery Factory, while working there, trial-producing diesel locomotives and electric locomotives for use on China's railways.

Practice has proven that this method of schools and factories collaborating on scientific research and designing and manufacturing new products has a very significant effect on improving the quality of teaching, cultivating students' independent working abilities, and raising students' communist ideological awareness. Some teaching materials have been tested in production practice, and outdated or erroneous parts have been updated and corrected, enabling students to learn a lot of knowledge from production practice that is not found in textbooks. When students of the Shipbuilding Department took the "Shipbuilding Technology" course at the Hudong Shipyard, they invited veteran workers to teach part of the course. For example, textbooks state that preventing welding deformation of T-shaped steel requires a very complex machine that China does not currently have, but in reality, the factory has adopted another simple machine with the same principle and good results. When students majoring in vehicles from the Transportation and Hoisting Machinery Department were engaged in product design at the Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, they found that some of the course content learned in school lacked new technology. Through production practice, new technological components currently found in the vehicle manufacturing industry, such as air conditioning, high-speed bogies, and centralized power supply, have been added to the two courses "Vehicle Internal Equipment" and "Vehicle Strength and Design."

Students' engagement in product design in factories is a good exercise to cultivate students' independent working abilities. In the past, students engaged in virtual graduation designs on campus. Although this had a certain effect on comprehensively summarizing five years of learning outcomes and cultivating students' working abilities, most of these designs were based on assumptions and could not be tested in practice. Engaging in real product design in factories requires designers to carefully consider the reasonableness of the structure, the economy of manufacturing, and the convenience of operation and maintenance. During the design process, students often went deep into the workshops to consult with workers. Finally, the designed drawings were tested by the manufacturing workshop, which further gave students a lot of vivid and rich practical knowledge and established the design concept of "more, faster, better, and more economical." In order to enable each student to obtain complete knowledge of a certain product, the thermal locomotive major of the Transportation and Hoisting Machinery Department carried out an exchange of experiences for a week after completing the design of the diesel locomotive at the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory. Through this design, students generally felt that their confidence in independent work had increased, and the factory unanimously believed that the working ability of this group of fifth-year students had reached a considerably high level.

The workers' spirit of selfless labor and working attitude during the Great Leap Forward are the most vivid teaching materials for educating students on communist ideology. A student from the Shipbuilding Department, who participated in productive labor at the Hudong Shipyard, witnessed an old worker being awarded first prize for his active work. However, he wrote a big-character poster stating that his achievements were small and that he should not have been awarded the prize and should have let another comrade receive the award. Many workers worked intensely and actively requested to abolish piece-rate wages and waive overtime pay. Countless vivid examples educated this student, and he excitedly said, "I have seen with my own eyes that the working class is doing everything for socialism, and I want to learn from the worker comrades."

As the new semester begins, various departments of Jiaotong University are preparing to collaborate with factories in a more planned and organized manner in formulating new teaching plans in order to further improve and enhance teaching.

    学校工厂协作　学生工人互助
    上海交通大学结合生产进行教学和科学研究
    本报讯　上海交通大学最近在总结教学工作中，认为按系科专业与有关工厂协作，进行科学研究和设计制造新产品，是教学结合生产劳动的好方式之一，它可以补充学校自办工厂的不足，既提高了教学质量，又使工厂获得有力的技术援助。
    交通大学是一个综合性工科学校，校内虽然设有机械制造、冶金、运输起重机、造船和电机等五个工厂，但是规模较小，只能作为对低年级学生进行基本工种训练的场所，或是研究和生产少量的产品，不能满足高年级学生从事高深理论的探讨和研究大型、高级、精密、尖端产品的需要。去年在贯彻教学结合生产劳动的教育方针中，学过基础理论课和一些专业课的高年级学生，迫切要求到工厂中从事生产劳动，结合进行教学和科学研究。他们在劳动中边学边干，有的帮助工厂设计和制造新产品，把工厂当做学校的实验车间，利用工厂比较完备的设备和技术条件，研究高级、尖端的技术，使理论研究和生产紧密结合，收到很好的效果。船舶制造系五年级学生和一部分教师在沪东造船厂学完了船舶工艺和船舶设备系统两门课，与这个厂的技术干部和工人合作研究成功六十五项新技术，大大提高了劳动生产率，改善了工人的劳动条件。有八十八位学生为此被评为出席第二次全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的先进集体。运输起重机械系四、五年级学生和教师，先后在青岛四方机车车辆厂、戚墅堰机车车辆厂和湘潭电机厂，一面劳动，一面参加工厂及有关研究单位的设计工作，试制出了我国铁路上应用的内燃机车和电气机车。
    实践证明，这种学校与工厂协作搞科学研究和设计制造新产品的方式，对提高教学质量、培养学生独立工作能力和提高学生的共产主义思想觉悟等方面，都有着非常显著的成就。一些教材在生产实践中受到考验，陈旧的或错误的部分得到更新和改正，使学生们从生产实际中学到很多书本上所没有的知识。船舶制造系学生在沪东造船厂上船舶工艺课时，请老工人讲授了一部分课程。其中如书本上讲述防止丁字型钢焊接变形，须采用我国目前还没有的一种结构非常复杂的机器，而实际上工厂中已经采用另一种结构简单的机器，原理一样，效果很好。运输起重机械系车辆专业学生在青岛四方机车车辆厂从事产品设计时，发现学校中学习的有些课程内容缺乏新的技术。通过生产实践，车辆内部设备及车辆强度和设计两门课中，已增加了空气调节、高速转向架、集中供电等当前车辆制造工业中的新技术部分。船舶动力系的教师以前并不掌握自由活塞发生器这门学科，去年师生一边学习一边研究，与内燃机科学研究所合作设计一千马力的自由活塞发生器和二千马力的燃气轮机以后，学生们在教师指导下编写出了十多万字的自由活塞发生器讲义初稿，决定在新的学期中采用。
    学生们在工厂中从事产品设计，对培养学生独立工作能力是一场很好的锻炼。以往学生在校内搞虚拟的毕业设计，虽然对全面总结五年学习成果和培养学生工作能力有一定的作用，但是这种设计大多数是出于假想，得不到实际的考验。在工厂中从事真实的产品设计，要求设计者细致地考虑到结构合理、制造经济以及运用检修是否方便等等。设计过程中，学生们经常深入车间，请教工人，最后图纸设计出来还受到制造车间的考验，这就使学生们进一步得到很多生动丰富的实际知识，树立起多快好省的设计思想。为了使每个学生都得到某一产品的完备知识，运输起重机械系的热力机车专业在戚墅堰机车车辆厂完成内燃机车的设计之后，各设计小组集中进行了一星期的经验交流。通过这场设计，学生们普遍感到独立工作的信心增强了，工厂也一致认为这批五年级学生的工作能力，已经达到相当高的水平。
    工人们在大跃进中忘我劳动的精神和工作态度，是对学生们进行共产主义思想教育的最生动的教材。船舶制造系有一位学生在沪东造船厂参加生产劳动中，亲眼看到一位老工人因工作积极被评上一等奖，他却写了大字报认为自己成绩很小，不该评上，应该让另一个同志得奖；很多工人紧张地劳动，他们主动要求取消计件工资，不要加班费。无数生动的事例教育了这位学生，他激动地说：“我亲眼看到工人阶级是一切为了社会主义的，我要向工人同志学习。”
    新的学期开始了，交通大学各个系科在制定新的教学计划中，正准备更加有计划有组织地与工厂协作，以便进一步改进并提高教学。
