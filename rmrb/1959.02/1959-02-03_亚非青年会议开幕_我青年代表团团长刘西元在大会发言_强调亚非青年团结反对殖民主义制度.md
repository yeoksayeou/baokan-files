He said that the conference was held in accordance with the resolutions and spirit of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference, and it was the first time that so many Afro-Asian youth had gathered together to discuss their common problems.

He continued, due to the oppression of imperialism and colonialism, contact between Afro-Asian youth had been hindered and their solidarity had been undermined. Now, more and more Afro-Asian countries have stood up, they have shattered the shackles of colonialism and the rule of imperialism, and have taken their destiny into their own hands.

He also said that there are still some Afro-Asian countries that are struggling for national independence and against imperialism, colonialism, and racial discrimination.

He believes that inspired by the Bandung Conference and the spirit of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference, this conference will discuss common issues in an atmosphere of friendship and cooperation. He said that this discussion will help strengthen the solidarity of Afro-Asian youth, help the cause of winning and safeguarding national independence, and help defend peace and youth welfare.

Referring to the Youth Festival of the United Arab Republic, he expressed his gratitude to the youth of the United Arab Republic for providing this great opportunity, "enabling us to understand their achievements in culture and sports and to appreciate their rich and varied performances, and enabling us to strengthen our friendship with the youth of the United Arab Republic."
