    Xinhua News Agency, February 17th. The Ministry of Agriculture, at a wheat spring irrigation telephone conference held on the 14th, requested all wheat-producing provinces to take immediate action, vigorously promote fertilizer application while simultaneously focusing on spring irrigation. They were to launch a massive campaign of wheat field management that would advance both water and fertilizer application, ensuring that the wheat is well-fed and watered, striving to achieve the goal of a thousand catties per mu.

    Agricultural and water conservancy department heads from ten provinces and regions including Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Sichuan participated in the meeting. He Jifeng, Vice Minister of Agriculture, delivered a speech at the meeting.

    The meeting pointed out that this year, wheat seedlings in most areas are growing densely and robustly, with good development. This requires more moisture than in previous years. In Henan Province, over 40% of the more than 70 million mu of wheat fields have already been irrigated with winter water. Facts show that wheat seedlings that have been watered in winter generally have a plant height of 12.1 cm and an average of 3.9 tillers, while those that have not been watered have a plant height of only 9.7 cm and an average of 2.3 tillers, fully demonstrating the enormous effect of irrigation on wheat yield increase.

    At the meeting, the provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, and Shandong reported on the preparations for spring irrigation. From the reports of these provinces, it can be seen that all areas have made some preparations for spring irrigation. Generally, irrigation work conferences have been held, and some counties have established spring irrigation headquarters. They have great confidence and are full of energy. Cadres in Shandong Province, after calculating five accounts including water sources, water conservancy projects, water lifting tools, rainfall, and water demand, overcame right-leaning conservative sentiments and established the idea of ensuring high yields through irrigation. They are now actively leading the masses to repair and manufacture water lifting tools, and renovate canals, reservoirs, and ponds. In order to ensure a greater and better leap forward in wheat production this year, other regions have also adopted many important measures, deciding to grasp spring irrigation work early, tightly, firmly, and thoroughly. Many provinces are preparing to hold province-wide spring irrigation broadcast mobilization rallies soon, with the Party Secretary personally taking command to lead this large-scale wheat field spring irrigation campaign. Responsible comrades such as the Deputy Governor and Secretary-General of the Henan Provincial Party Committee have led cadres to go to the countryside to delve into the field to conduct command. They plan that from the 20th, the labor force in the province devoted to spring irrigation will increase from the current three million to ten million, ensuring that the daily progress of watering reaches four million mu. Many regions have put forward combat slogans such as "Universally irrigate wheat with regreening water, guaranteeing a doubling of yield," "A thousand catties target, three thousand catties of measures, ten thousand catties of effort," and "Make every drop of water serve to increase grain production." They aim to complete both the irrigated area and the number of irrigations per mu, determined to fire the first shot in the battle for increased production on the agricultural front this year.

    Vice Minister of Agriculture He Jifeng said in his speech that this year, wheat generally grows very well, with deep plowing, dense planting, abundant fertilizer application, and good subsoil moisture. This requires a corresponding leap forward in water conservancy. At the same time, since last winter, most areas have had less rain and snow, and spring drought may occur. Therefore, spring irrigation has become a crucial measure to ensure increased wheat stalks, large ears, and full grains.

    After analyzing the characteristics of the current situation, He Jifeng hoped that all provinces would deeply carry out wheat field management work centered on topdressing and watering. It is necessary to exert full effort and make specific calculations and arrangements in terms of tasks, water volume, time, and labor, placing spring irrigation work on a reliable basis. During the irrigation period, the method of "guaranteeing quality, guaranteeing quantity, and guaranteeing time" can be adopted, and a detailed responsibility system established to ensure that spring irrigation work is carried out quickly and well. He Jifeng particularly emphasized that it is currently necessary to strengthen water storage and conservation, and combine the construction of water conservancy projects with the renovation of field projects. Repair and rush-manufacture water lifting tools. The phenomenon of damage and shortage of water lifting tools is relatively common this year, which is a major problem in spring irrigation work. All regions must immediately take action and adopt all measures to carry out emergency repairs and rush-manufacturing. Water lifting machinery that has been used for other purposes should be quickly returned to the team for installation and preparation. It is necessary to ensure that there are wells and tools, and water is available, so as not to delay spring irrigation. (Attached picture)

### 春灌返青水　夏收丰产麦  十省区电话会议确定及时抓紧抓好春灌工作

    春灌返青水　夏收丰产麦
    十省区电话会议确定及时抓紧抓好春灌工作
    新华社17日讯　农业部在14日召开的小麦春灌电话会议上，要求各产麦省立即行动起来，在大搞肥料的同时抓紧春灌，掀起一个声势浩大的水肥齐头并进的麦田管理运动，使小麦吃饱喝足，力争实现亩产千斤的目标。
    参加这次会议的有河北、山东、河南、山西、陕西、甘肃、新疆、江苏、安徽、四川等十个省区的农业、水利方面的厅、局长。农业部副部长何基沣在会上作了发言。
    会议指出：今年各地麦苗大都长得密而粗壮，发育良好。这就需要有比往年更多的水分。河南全省七千多万亩麦田中，40％以上已经灌过冬水，事实表明：冬浇过的麦苗一般株高十二点一公分，平均分蘖三点九个，而没有灌过水的株高只有九点七公分，平均分蘖二点三个；充分显示了灌溉对小麦增产的巨大作用。
    会上，河南、陕西、山东三个省汇报了小麦春灌准备工作的情况。从这些省的汇报来看，各地都已经作了一些春灌的准备工作，一般都召开了灌溉工作会议，有些县已成立了春灌指挥部。他们的信心很大，干劲很足。山东省的干部算了水源、水利工程、提水工具、降雨量、需水量等五笔账后，克服了右倾保守情绪，树立了灌溉保丰产的思想，现正积极地领导群众修补、制造提水工具，整修渠道、山塘、水库。为了保证今年小麦有更大更好的跃进，其他各地也都采取了许多重要措施，决定把春灌工作抓早、抓紧、抓狠、抓到底。很多省最近准备召开全省的春灌广播誓师大会，由党委书记亲自挂帅，领导这次大规模的麦田春灌运动。河南省副省长、省委秘书长等负责同志已率领干部下乡深入现场进行指挥。他们计划从20日起，全省投入春灌的劳动力将由现在的三百万人增加为一千万人，保证每天浇水的进度达到四百万亩。很多地区提出了“普浇小麦返青水，保证产量翻一番”、“一千斤指标、三千斤措施、一万斤干劲”、“使每滴水为粮食增产服务”等战斗口号，要做到既完成灌溉面积、又完成灌溉亩次，决心打响今年农业战线上增产的第一炮。
    农业部副部长何基沣在发言中说：今年小麦一般都长得很好；耕的深、种的密、施肥多、底墒好，这就要求水利必须有相应的跃进。同时，去冬以来，大部分地区雨雪较少，可能发生春旱，因此，春灌已成为保证小麦增株、穗大、粒饱的关键性的措施。
    何基沣在分析了当前形势的特点后，希望各省深入开展以追肥、浇水为中心的小麦田间管理工作。要鼓足干劲，并从任务、水量、时间、劳力等方面，具体计算，切实安排，把春灌工作放在可靠的基础上，在灌水时期，可采取“包质、包量、包时间”的办法，建立细致的责任制度，使春灌工作进行得又快又好。何基沣特别强调：当前要加强蓄水保水，结合兴修水利整修田间工程。修理、赶制提水工具。今年提水工具损坏短缺现象比较普遍，这是春灌工作中的大问题。各地要立即行动起来，采取一切措施，进行抢修赶制。提水机械已作他用的，应当迅速归队，安装备用。要做到有井有具、要水有水，不误春灌。（附图片）
