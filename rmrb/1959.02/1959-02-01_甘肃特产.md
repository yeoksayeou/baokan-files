Gansu Specialties

    The World-Renowned Danggui (Angelica Sinensis)

    In the vast land of Gansu Province, abundant home-grown and wild medicinal materials grow. The variety and quantity are second only to Sichuan, making it one of China's major medicinal material producing areas. Among them, the quality of Danggui is particularly good, and the yield is very high, ranking first in the world. It is not only sold throughout the country but also enjoys a high reputation in the international market.

    The history of planting Danggui in Gansu Province dates back about two thousand years. In areas such as Minxian, Wudu, Xili, and Wenxian, you can see small white flowers all over the mountains in summer and autumn, with a refreshing fragrance. Danggui is a perennial herb whose root is sweet and warm in nature, mainly used to treat gynecological diseases and hemiplegia. This year, the province's Danggui planting area will expand from more than 45,000 mu last year to more than 60,000 mu, with a total output of about 14.4 million jin. Exporting one ton of Danggui can exchange for fifteen tons of gasoline, and exporting six tons can exchange for a tractor. Now, the province is continuing to expand new planting areas and increase production significantly.

    Golden Monkey

    The golden monkey is one of the world's rare animals. Its golden fur shines brightly. Its skin is soft and can be used to make fur coats and fur mattresses, and it can also prevent rheumatic arthritis. Its bones can also be used to treat diseases. In the Huaguo Mountain area of the Bailong River Basin in southern Gansu Province, golden monkeys live in groups. They are sensitive, understand human nature to some extent, and are difficult to capture. When people try to capture them, if a person stands at the foot of the mountain and points at them, they will throw stones from the top of the mountain at the person. When they are afraid, the male and female monkeys embrace each other in a pleading manner. The province captured several hundred of them last year and is experimenting with domestication in breeding farms in Lanzhou and Wenxian. Now, hundreds of people are living in tents in the mountains near Wenxian, conducting observations and research to transform them from wild to domesticated animals.

      Lanzhou Water Tobacco

    The nationally renowned Lanzhou water tobacco has a recorded history dating back to the early Qing Dynasty. Its sales scope covers not only the entire country but also extends to various parts of Southeast Asia.

    According to statistics from six counties and cities near Lanzhou, the tobacco planting area is about 40,000 mu, with an average annual output of 7 million jin of tobacco leaves. It has been loved by the masses for hundreds of years due to its bright color, fragrant taste, and sufficient oil content. Under unified planning, Lanzhou water tobacco is now developing according to plan.

    Tianshui Lacquerware

    The main feature of Tianshui lacquerware is that it is made from natural lacquer from lacquer trees, processed and then lacquered. It is jet black and shiny, resistant to the erosion of strong hydrochloric acid, and can also withstand the burning of small fires, and is not afraid of scalding. The products made with this lacquer include exquisite smoking sets, tea sets, dressing boxes, colorful vases, and elegant and generous tables, chairs, and wardrobes. In addition to the glittering dragons and phoenixes and landscapes painted on each piece of lacquerware, large furniture also has figures, pavilions, flowers, trees, and birds and animals carved and inlaid with ivory, jade, and colored stones, revealing their spirits vividly. Smoking sets and tea sets are made of de-molded cloth, which will not break if dropped on the ground; larger furniture is made of walnut wood, which is sturdy and durable. This year, these precious lacquerware items have been selling well abroad.

    Night-Luminous Cups

    Wang Han's poem "Grape wine in night-luminous cups" refers to the night-luminous cups of Jiuquan. According to legend, during the reign of King Mu of Zhou, the Western Regions offered night-luminous cups, which were the essence of white jade, shining brightly at night, also referring to the night-luminous cups of Jiuquan.

    Jiuquan night-luminous cups are carved from the beautiful jade of the Qilian Mountains, with various colors such as milky white, dark green, light yellow, and combinations of various colors. After processing and careful carving by artisans, the colors are lustrous, the colorful patterns are beautiful, and the styles are elegant.

    Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were more than fifty jade production companies in Jiuquan, with more than one hundred people employed. After the war, many excellent jade artisans became unemployed and changed careers. In the end, only Wang Sanzhong, who had been carving jade for three generations, remained. After liberation, Jiuquan's jade craftsmanship returned to prosperity. Wang Sanzhong, who has been engaged in jade production for forty-seven years, works happily with other artisans. Now, the variety of jade cups has increased to more than a dozen, including high-footed cups, flat-bottomed cups, magnificent high-seated jade cups with flared edges, elegant flat-bottomed wave cups, and exquisite and unique colorful wine cups.

    Gourd Carving

    The carved gourds of Lanzhou are about the size of walnuts, and are carved with figures, landscapes, flowers, and poems from "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Water Margin," "Dream of the Red Chamber," and "Romance of the West Chamber." The characters are as small as dust mites, and when viewed with a magnifying glass, the patterns are clear and the handwriting is beautiful, making them unique artistic handicrafts in China, renowned both at home and abroad.

    In recent years, the Lanzhou Municipal Arts and Crafts Carving Factory, which specializes in producing such gourds, has carefully considered and grasped the content of the carvings and the spirit of the stories, striving for refinement and elegance. In terms of carving techniques, it also focuses on three-dimensionality and the coordination of light, distance, yin and yang. Exports began last year, and the demand from abroad is very high.

    甘肃特产
    驰名中外的当归
    在甘肃省辽阔的土地上，生长着丰富的家种药材与野生药材，品种之多、数量之大，仅次于四川，为我国主要药材产地之一。其中当归的品质特别好，产量很大，居世界第一位，不但行销全国各地，在国际市场上也享有盛誉。
    甘肃省种植当归的历史，约有两千年左右。在岷县、武都、西礼、文县等一带，夏秋间可看到满山遍野的小白花，清香扑鼻。当归是多年生草本植物，其根甘甜，性温，主治妇科疾病和半身不遂等症。今年全省当归的种植面积将由去年的四万五千多亩扩大到六万多亩，总产量约一千四百四十万斤。输出一吨当归，可换回十五吨汽油，出口六吨可换拖拉机一台。现在，全省还在继续扩大新的种植区，大量增产。
    金丝猴
    金丝猴是世界上稀有的动物之一。金黄色的长毛闪闪发亮，它的皮柔软，可做皮大衣、皮褥，又可以防治风湿性关节炎，其骨亦可以治病。在甘肃省南部白龙江流域的花果山上，金丝猴成群结队。它性情灵敏，颇识人性，捕捉困难。开始人去捕捉时，人站在山下用手对它指一指，它就会从山顶往人身上扔石头。当它害怕时，公母互相拥抱做哀求的样子。全省去年捕获到几百只，在兰州和文县的饲养场里试验驯养。现在，有几百人带着帐篷住在文县附近的山里，进行观察和研究，以使野生变为家养。
      兰州水烟
    名闻全国的兰州水烟，有文字记载的是在清朝初年。销售范围不仅遍及全国，而且销到南洋各地。
    据兰州附近六个县市的统计，烟田种植面积约四万亩，平均年产烟叶达七百万斤。它能够相沿几百年为群众所喜爱，是由于它色亮、味香、油分足。兰州水烟在统一安排下，现在正按计划发展着。
    天水漆器
    天水漆器的主要特点是用漆树上的天然漆，经过加工后漆成。乌黑油亮，能耐烈性盐酸的浸蚀，也能抗微火的燃烧，不怕烫煮。用这种漆制造的有精制的烟具、茶具、梳妆盒、鲜艳的花瓶、华丽大方的桌、椅、衣柜等。每一件漆器上除绘有金光鳞鳞的龙凤、山水外，在大型家具上还有用象牙、玉器、彩石雕刻镶填的人物、亭台、花草、树木以及鸟兽等，神态尽露，翩若活物。烟具、茶具等系用脱胎布所制，掉地下摔不坏；较大的家具是用核桃木做的，坚固耐用。今年，这些名贵漆器已畅销国外。

    夜光杯
    王翰有“葡萄美酒夜光杯”诗句，就是指酒泉的夜光杯。相传，周穆王时，西域献夜光常满杯，是白玉之精，光明夜照，也是指酒泉的夜光杯。
    酒泉夜光杯是采祁连山美玉雕成，有乳白、墨绿、浅黄以及各色相兼等多种颜色，经过艺人加工细琢，颜色光泽，彩纹秀丽，式样美观。
    抗战前，酒泉当地从事玉石生产的有五十多家，一百多人。抗战后，很多优秀的玉器艺人纷纷失业、改行。最后只有祖传三辈雕玉石的王三中一个人。解放后，酒泉的玉器工艺才又走向繁荣。从事玉器生产四十七年之久的王三中同别的艺人一起愉快地劳动着。现在，玉杯的品种已增加了十多种，有高脚杯、平底杯、雄伟美观的高座翻沿玉杯、古雅清秀的平底浪杯、玲珑别致的花色酒盅等。
    刻葫芦
    兰州雕刻的小葫芦，大小和核桃差不多，上面刻有三国志、水浒传、红楼梦、西厢记等人物、山水、花卉及诗词歌赋。字如尘芥，用放大镜看去，花纹显明，字迹秀丽，为我国独特的艺术手工制品，名闻中外。
    近年来，专门生产此种葫芦的兰州市美术工艺雕刻厂，对刻绘内容、故事精神的体会掌握等方面，详加推敲，力求精湛雅致。在刻工方面，又着重于立体化与光线、远近、阴阳相配合。去年开始出口，因国外需要量非常大。（附图片）
