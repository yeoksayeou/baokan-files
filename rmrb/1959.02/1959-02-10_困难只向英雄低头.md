    Difficulties Only Bow Their Heads to Heroes
    Fang Zhi
    This year's spring is the starting point for striving for a greater leap forward after a year of the Great Leap Forward, a season full of hope. In such days, seeing "Starting from Scratch," a film that reflects new people and new events and describes people's soaring drive, is a great encouragement and a powerful spur.
    "Starting from Scratch" tells the story of how the Benxi Alloy Factory was built up through diligence and thrift. This factory initially had only one ladle, two pots, three molds, and four workers. Even the factory buildings were borrowed from others. However, through hard work, they finally grew and strengthened. Now it produces more than 270 kinds of alloys, which, in addition to supplying many factories and mining enterprises across the country, some products are even sold abroad. This is such a remarkable thing that it deserves a grand celebration!
    The development of the Benxi Alloy Factory from small to large was not smooth sailing. There were quite complex contradictions and struggles in between—not only was it necessary to overcome difficulties in material conditions, but also to break through the obstruction of outdated ideas! Under the leadership and support of the Party, and driven by the Communist Party member Su Xinjun, they overcame numerous difficulties, rebuilt the furnace, and refined high-quality steel. The film vividly reflects a sharp struggle between new and old ideas, and enthusiastically praises the growth of new things and the victory of new forces. In the face of any new thing, there will always be some people who shake their heads and talk nonsense, hesitating and doubting. However, the old forces can in no way stop the growth of new things. They will eventually emerge, develop rapidly, and cause the decadent things to shrink and disappear into their magnificent and powerful momentum. When that first furnace of boiling molten iron appeared on the screen, when the workers re-mentioned the old saying that the factory director had said, "If you can refine steel from this furnace, I will drink it," we were infected by their unparalleled joyful mood, and at the same time, we more clearly understood this truth.
    The Benxi Alloy Factory was able to overcome numerous difficulties and grow from small to large because of the achievements of that group of heroes with soaring enthusiasm and lofty aspirations. Although "Starting from Scratch" is a highly documentary film, it does not relax the portrayal of characters, and it displays the characters' personalities and inner activities from many aspects. Therefore, these heroic figures have left a deep impression on our hearts. We cannot forget Huang Hongyi, this young lad, who, in order to prevent the factory building from catching fire, picked up a burning gasoline barrel and rushed out, resulting in burns all over his body. But he was not discouraged. After recovering from his illness, he still worked hard and became a skilled and advanced worker, a glorious Communist Party member, and had a happy family. We cannot forget Su Xinjun, who is now the director of this alloy factory. In difficult days, he told the workers the story of Marshal He Long making revolution with a kitchen knife, conducted revolutionary tradition education for them, and cheered them up. He once led the workers to grind refractory bricks by themselves to build furnaces. He once taught the workers technology without reservation, and carefully studied with them how to improve work methods and refine good steel. We cannot forget Zhang Fuxin, Wang Huaishun, and other advanced workers... It is these people who are not afraid of difficulties or hardships who have used their omnipotent hands to change the face of the mountains and rivers, and made difficulties crumble at the mere sight of them!
    On the road ahead, difficulties will continue to appear. However, we dare to challenge it and dare to attack it. Difficulties bowed their heads in front of the heroes of "Starting from Scratch," and difficulties will also bow their heads in front of all the heroic Chinese people!

    困难只向英雄低头
    方芷
    今年的春天是跃进一年以后争取更大跃进的起点，是充满了希望的季节。在这样的日子里，看到“白手起家”这部反映新人新事、描写人们的冲天干劲的影片，是莫大的鼓舞，也是有力的鞭策。
    “白手起家”是讲述本溪合金厂怎样克勤克俭地办起来的。这个厂最初只有一把杓子，两口锅，三个模子，四个工人，连厂房都是向别人借的；但是他们刻苦奋斗，终于使它成长壮大起来。现在它已出产了二百七十多种合金，除了供给全国许多厂矿企业外，有些产品，甚至运销国外。这是一件多么了不起的值得大书特书的事！
    本溪合金厂由小到大的发展过程中，不是一帆风顺的，其间有着相当复杂的矛盾斗争——不仅是需要克服物质条件方面的困难，而且还需要冲破陈旧思想的阻挠！在党的领导支持下，在共产党员苏新军的带动下，他们克服重重困难，改建了炉子，炼出了质量很好的钢。影片生动地反映了一场尖锐的新旧思想的斗争，并且满怀热情地歌颂了新事物的成长，歌颂了新的力量的胜利。在任何新事物面前，总会有一些人摇头晃脑地说东道西，犹豫怀疑。不过陈旧的力量无论如何也阻挡不住新的东西的生长，它们最终总会冒出头来，一日千里地向前发展，使陈腐的东西萎缩消失在它们宏伟磅礴的气势里。当影片上出现那第一炉滚滚沸腾的铁水时，当工人们重新提起厂长说过的那一句老话：“你们这个炉子要是能炼出钢水来，我就把它喝了”时，我们感染到他们那无比欢愉的情绪，同时也更清楚地认识了这个道理。
    本溪合金厂能够克服重重困难、由小到大地成长起来，是那一群干劲冲天、壮志凌云的英雄们的功绩。“白手起家”虽然是一部纪录性很强的影片，但是它却没有放松对人物的描写，并且是从多方面来展示人物的性格和内心活动的，因此这些英雄人物在我们心中留下了深刻的印象。我们不能忘记黄洪义，这个年青的小伙子，为了不使厂房着火，他抱起一个燃烧的汽油桶冲了出去，结果满身被烧伤了。但是他没有气馁，病愈以后，仍然苦学苦练，成了一个熟练的先进工人，成了一个光荣的共产党员，而且有了一个美好幸福的家庭。我们不能忘掉苏新军，他现在是这个合金厂的厂长。在困难的日子里，他曾给工人们讲贺龙元帅一把菜刀闹革命的故事，对他们进行革命传统教育，给他们打气；他曾经带着工人自己磨耐火砖修建炉子；他曾经毫无保留地教工人们学技术，并且和他们一道细心研究如何改进工作方法，炼出好钢。我们也不能忘记张富信、王怀顺等等先进工人，……正是这些不怕难不怕苦的人们，用他们万能的双手，使得山河改变了面貌，使得困难望风披靡！
    在前进的道路上，困难总是会不断出现的；然而，我们敢于向它挑战，敢于朝它攻击。困难在“白手起家”的英雄面前低了头，困难也将在所有英雄的中国人民面前低下头！
