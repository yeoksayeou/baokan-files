    Sanmao and Alyosha
    Joint painting by Yefimov and Zhang Lepin
              Poem by Yuan Ying
I'm called Sanmao, and you're called Alyosha.
Thousands of miles apart, we've never spoken;
But today we meet with joy, like dear brothers.
Two red scarves, hanging on each other's chests,
Hang well, look and look again, laughing together.
The red sun shines overhead, blooming two red flowers.
The warm east wind blows, the clear spring rain sprinkles,
The Sino-Soviet friendship is sown, sprouting new shoots every year.
Look at the two seedlings: Sanmao and Alyosha.
I imagine their hearts are exactly the same:
Both want to never part, both want to grow up quickly,
Riding a thousand-mile steed, traveling all over the world!

    三毛和阿廖沙
    叶菲莫夫　张乐平　合画
              袁　鹰　配诗我叫小三毛，你叫阿廖沙。相隔几万里，没有说过话；今日喜相逢，好像亲哥俩。两条红领巾，相互胸前挂，挂好瞧又瞧，同声笑哈哈。红日当头照，绽开双红花。暖暖东风吹，清清春雨洒，中苏友谊种，岁岁发新芽。请看两幼苗：三毛阿廖沙。料想两人心，半点也不差：都想永不离，都想快长大，同骑千里驹，走遍全天下！
