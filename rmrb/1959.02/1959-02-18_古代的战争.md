	Ancient Wars
	Liu Mianzhi

	Soviet Defense Minister Malinovsky, at the 21st Congress of the CPSU, sarcastically remarked about the nuclear war plans of the American and British war maniacs, "Gentlemen, your arms are too short!"

	Modern warfare extensively utilizes scientific and technological achievements. Soviet intercontinental rockets and missiles can strike any corner of the earth with perfect accuracy. Soviet scientific and technological achievements powerfully safeguard world peace, making the war maniacs with short arms afraid to lightly initiate a war that would destroy themselves.

	The length of arms illustrates the military strength of the two major camps today.

	It was the same in ancient times. Before the invention of long-range weapons, war was a struggle between people. Spears, knives, arrows, and pikes were all extensions of the arms. The physical strength of generals and soldiers, their proficiency in using weapons, the weight of the weapons, and the combination of bravery and wit all played a role in war.

	During war, soldiers fought soldiers, generals fought generals, engaging in face-to-face combat. Battles often ended when one side, suffering more casualties, was unable to continue fighting.

	The battles between generals could last hundreds of rounds. Although A killing B or B killing C did not necessarily determine the outcome of the war, it often played a crucial role in some situations. In particular, the death of the enemy's main general or a brave commander would lead to a loss of command and affect morale, inevitably leading to defeat.

	Novels and operas often depict wars. Besides using a few soldiers as symbols of the vast army of both sides, the focus of the war is usually placed on the battles between the main generals of the two sides. This approach is based on historical facts.

	In a duel between generals, there is talk of fighting hundreds of rounds. One round means an exchange of blows. Whether on horseback or on foot, the general must wield a weapon. The two armies face each other with a distance in between. Both sides advance simultaneously, and when they come face-to-face, they use their weapons to injure each other. If the attack misses, they must retreat to prepare for the second encounter. This advance and retreat is called one round. In a struggle for life and death, the length of the arm, which is the length and weight of the weapon, is of utmost importance. Long weapons such as spears, broadswords, and pikes are superior to short weapons such as swords and daggers. Even more important is the proficiency in using the weapon and the person's wit, which depends on martial skill. With the same physical strength and weapons, martial skill determines the victory or defeat. To protect themselves, generals must wear helmets and armor, which are very heavy. The horses of mounted generals also wear armor. Adding the weight of the weapons themselves, it is impossible to sustain without extreme physical strength. In some cases, when the fight is deadlocked, they have to change horses. There are also cases where the general himself is not defeated, but because the horse is exhausted or injured, unable to advance or retreat, he is injured by the enemy and suffers defeat. "Shoot the man, shoot the horse first," is the reason for this.

	Flags, gongs, and drums were used to command during wartime, called the three officials.

	Flags controlled the regulations. The great general had a large banner to command the entire army, with directional flags: azure in the east, red in the south, white in the west, black in the north, and yellow in the center, commanding each direction. Because there were many people and long distances, it was difficult to hear speech, and sending messengers on horseback took time, flags were used for command: waving the central flag meant the entire army assembled; flag lowered meant kneel; flag raised meant stand; flag rolled meant gagged and marched; flag lowered meant lie prone; seeing the enemy flag waved three times meant forming a formation; raising a directional flag meant the troops in that direction must quickly prepare; flag lowered meant advance; flag raised meant stop; flag lowered meant retreat. Calling generals used a black flag; one point of the black flag meant the squad leader assembled; two points meant the centurion assembled; three points meant the five-hundred-man general assembled; one point and one wave meant the thousand-man general assembled.

	Gongs and drums controlled advance and retreat; beating the drum meant advance; sounding the gong meant retreat.

	Striking the drum three times was a total of a thousand strikes, with three hundred and thirty-three strikes per drumbeat (one saying is three hundred and sixty-five strikes). During peacetime marches, drums were beaten and horns were blown to signal alert. The horn was blown twelve times as one stack, the drum sound stopped, the horn sound moved, three horn signals and three drum signals day and night. Generals and below were equipped with drums according to their rank. In case of emergency, the vanguard beat the drums to warn, and the entire army entered a state of war preparation (Song Zeng Gongliang, *Military Essentials*, volume 2; *Comprehensive Statutes*, volume 157).

	Killing the enemy and determining merit based on the number of heads was a system inherited from the Qin Dynasty, where killing one enemy was rewarded with one rank.

	When reporting merits and announcing battle achievements, it was customary to exaggerate, multiplying by ten. For example, if a hundred enemies were killed, the official report would definitely write a thousand ( *Zizhi Tongjian*, volume 66).

	The commander's flag was the symbol of the central army and the center of command for the entire army. If the commander's flag fell, the entire army would lose command and fall into chaos. Therefore, capturing the enemy's commander's flag became the main goal of ancient generals.

    古代的战争
    刘勉之
    苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基在苏共二十一次代表大会上，讽刺美英战争狂人的核战争方案说，“先生们，你们的手太短了！”
    现代战争广泛运用科学技术成就，苏联的洲际火箭、导弹可以击中地球上任何一个角落，百发百中；苏联的科学技术成就有力地保障了世界和平，使得手太短的战争狂人不敢轻于发动毁灭自己的战争。
    手长短说明今天两大阵营的军事力量。
    古代也是如此。在远距离的杀伤武器发明以前，战争是人与人的搏斗，枪、刀、箭、槊等都是手的延长。战将和士兵的体力，运用武器的熟练程度，武器的重量，和勇敢、机智的结合，在战争中发生作用。
    在战争进行中，士兵和士兵，战将和战将搏斗，面对面地厮杀，往往以伤亡较多的一方无力继续进行战斗而结束战局。
    将军和将军的厮杀，大战几百个回合。甲杀了乙或乙杀了丙，虽然不一定决定战争的胜负，但是，在有些场合，却也起着关键性的作用，特别是敌方的主将或骁将阵亡，失去指挥，影响士气，就非打败仗不可了。
  小说和戏文上常常描写战争，除了战争双方的队伍用几个战士作为大军的象征以外，战争展开的重点通常放在两方主将的搏斗上面，这种表现手法是有历史事实根据的。
    在斗将的场合，有大战几百个回合之说，一个回合的意思是交手一次。战将无论骑将或步将，都得手执武器。两军相对，中间有一段距离，双方同时前进，到了面对面接触的程度，互用武器杀伤对方，一击不中，就得退回来，准备第二次的接触，这样一进一退，就叫一个回合。在生和死的搏斗中，手的长短也就是武器的长短、重量是有极重要意义的。长枪、大刀、马槊等长武器要比用剑、短刀这类短武器更为优越。而更重要的则是使用武器的熟练程度、人的机智，这就要讲武艺了。同样的体力和武器，决定胜负的是武艺。战将为了保护自己，就得戴盔披甲，一付盔甲份量是很重的，骑将的马也得披甲，再加上武器本身的重量，没有极健壮的体力是支持不了的。在有些场合，斗到相持不下的时候，还得换马。也有这样一种情况，战将本人并未打败，只因马力乏了，或者马受伤了，进退不得，被敌方杀伤，吃了败仗。“射人先射马”，就是这个道理。
    战争时用旗、金、鼓指挥，叫作三官。
    旗是管节度的，大将有大纛，指挥全军，有方面旗：东方碧，南方赤，西白，北黑，中央土，指挥各方。因为人多距离远，讲话听不见，走马传令费时间，就用旗来指挥：中央旗挥动，全军集合，旗俯即跪，旗举即起，卷旗衔枚，卧旗俯伏，见敌旗三挥，布阵旗左右挥。方面旗举，方面兵急须装束，旗俯即进，旗竖即住，旗卧即回。召将用皂旗，一点皂旗队头集，二点皂旗百人将集，三点皂旗五百人将集，一点一招千人将集。
    金、鼓管进退，击鼓进军，鸣金退军。
    击鼓三通共千槌，一通三百三十三槌。（一说是三百六十五槌）。行军平时挝鼓吹角戒严，吹角一十二变为一叠，鼓音止，角音动，一昼夜三角三鼓。大将以下都按级别备鼓，遇有紧急事故，先头部队击鼓报警，全军就进入战争准备状态了（宋曾公亮武经总要卷二，通典卷一百五十七）。
    杀败敌人以首级论功，是沿袭秦的制度，杀一个敌人赐爵一级来的。
    报功和发表战绩时也照例要夸大一番，以一为十，例如杀敌百人，露布上必定要写千人之类（资治通鉴卷六十六）。
    帅旗是中军所在的标识，也是全军指挥的中心，帅旗一倒，全军就失去指挥，陷于混乱。以此，夺取敌方的帅旗也就成为古代战将的主要目标了。
