    We are the Defenders of Socialism and the Builders of Socialism
    ——Broadcast Speech by Fu Zhong, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, on the Spring Festival
    Dear Comrades:
    The Spring Festival of 1959 has arrived. The people of the whole country are celebrating this festival with great excitement and joy, celebrating the victory of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and welcoming an even greater leap forward in 1959. Now, on behalf of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I extend my warmest congratulations to all officers and soldiers, local militia, troops on the Fujian front and those performing coastal, land, and air defense duties, demobilized and transferred soldiers, families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and all compatriots across the country!
    In 1958, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the people of the whole country achieved brilliant victories in industrial and agricultural production, and a vigorous Great Leap Forward emerged on all fronts across the country. In this year, a magnificent people's commune movement was launched in rural areas across the country. The development of this movement promoted the rapid advancement of various construction undertakings. People's enthusiasm soared, their mental outlook changed day by day, and their socialist and communist consciousness was greatly enhanced. Encouraged by the situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country and the soaring enthusiasm of the masses, the Chinese People's Liberation Army threw itself into the ranks of the Leap Forward and received extremely profound and rich education in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward.
    Over the past year, various units of our army, through rectification movements and education from the masses of the people, especially the further implementation of the Party and Chairman Mao's military building thought, have brought about a more lively and dynamic political situation in all aspects of our army. Cadres' thinking and work style have made great progress, especially since the implementation of the measure of cadres going down to companies to serve as soldiers, the relationship between officers and soldiers and between superiors and subordinates has become more harmonious and the unity has become closer. As a result, extremely significant achievements have been made in military training, struggle against the enemy, and the execution of other tasks. In 1958, various units also actively participated in socialist construction. The number of voluntary labor days for socialist construction by the entire army throughout the year exceeded twice that of 1957. Since the spring of last year, troops in various regions have actively participated in the construction of more than 20,000 large and small water conservancy projects, such as the Ming Tombs Reservoir in Beijing, the Hunsha General Canal in Liaoning, the Songhua River Embankment in Harbin, the Huangma Reservoir in Nanjing, the Longtan Canal in Shaanxi, and the Minglang Reservoir in Kunming. On the steel front, troops have sent manpower to help with smelting and vehicles to help with transportation. In addition, troops in various regions have also participated in activities such as rush harvesting, rush planting, flood prevention, and drought resistance. In the people's commune movement, troops organized personnel, under the unified leadership of local Party committees, to assist communes in running collective welfare undertakings and help train militia backbones, which was greatly welcomed by the people. Facts have proved that doing so not only directly contributes to socialist construction but also enables comrades in the army to closely connect with the masses of the people, strengthen the unity between the army and the local areas and between the army and the people; it can enable comrades in the army to receive more education from the masses of the people, learn production knowledge and local work experience, improve communist consciousness, and improve work ability. This is of great significance for enhancing the combat effectiveness of our army.
    Over the past year, under the leadership of the Party committees in the areas where they are stationed, the various units of our army have received tremendous support in manpower and materials and spiritual encouragement from the masses of the people. Especially in the Fujian front and border areas, the people's support and care for the army has truly reached the point of fulfilling every request and being meticulous in every way. Precisely because of the support of the people and such rock-solid unity between the army and the people, the various tasks of the army have been successfully completed. We extend our greatest respect to the Party committees and governments at all levels and to all compatriots across the country! Comrades, the Spring Festival support-the-government-and-cherish-the-people activities, centered on supporting the people's communes, have already begun. All comrades should actively respond to the call of the General Political Department, resolutely implement the instructions of the General Political Department, and make significant achievements. Doing this work well will not only greatly enhance the relationship between the army and the people but also greatly promote the leap forward in our army's training and various tasks in 1959. All comrades should continue to deeply study the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and improve their theoretical and policy level and establish a correct attitude towards the people's communes through airing views, debates, visits, and directly assisting the people's communes in their work. In the support-the-government-and-cherish-the-people activities, we must also carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda work, and through activities such as New Year's greetings, get-togethers, and seminars, publicize to the residents of the stationed areas the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the superiority of the people's communes, and the important significance of the movement to accumulate and manufacture fertilizer for this year's agricultural production increase. At the same time, we must also educate and encourage our relatives to love the people's communes, actively participate in the production and construction undertakings of the people's communes, and be good members of the people's communes.
    We should also regularize the work of helping the people's communes and participating in socialist construction. Under the conditions of resolutely completing our own combat readiness and training tasks, we should work together with the people of the whole country to consolidate the people's communes and develop the various tasks of the people's communes. For example, participating in the construction of farmland water conservancy projects, participating in local seasonal agricultural production labor and afforestation, disaster relief, carrying out cultural, educational, and health work, helping to train militia, etc., can all be carried out near the stationed areas.
    Comrades, we are the defenders of socialism and the builders of socialism, both a fighting force and a working force. We must maintain and carry forward the fine traditions of the people's army and regard ourselves as ordinary laborers, treat the masses of the people with an equal, sincere, and humble attitude, strictly abide by mass discipline, and maintain close unity with the masses of the people. This is the source of our victory. At present, the international situation is unprecedentedly favorable to us, the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is even stronger, the Soviet Union's economic construction and science and culture have developed unprecedentedly, and the grand plan for building communism proposed by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is even more inspiring; the national liberation movements in Latin America and Africa, like sparks setting a prairie ablaze, are developing vigorously. The imperialist camp is full of contradictions, they are hitting walls everywhere, and are increasingly falling into disarray. But we must see that imperialism is going to make a desperate struggle, they are still engaging in conspiracies and creating tense situations everywhere. American imperialism is still occupying our territory of Taiwan and creating tension in the Taiwan Strait, so our army must maintain high vigilance, strengthen combat readiness, training, and the construction of various tasks, further strengthen the unity between the army and the people, and strive to defend the socialist construction of the motherland and to shatter the enemy's aggressive conspiracies!

    我们是社会主义的保卫者  又是社会主义的建设者
    ——解放军总政治部副主任傅钟的春节广播讲话
    亲爱的同志们：
    1959年的春节来到了。全国人民正以极其兴奋愉快的心情，欢度这个佳节，庆祝1958年大跃进的胜利，迎接1959年更大的跃进。现在我谨代表中国人民解放军总政治部向全军指战员、各地民兵、福建前线和担任海陆边防和空防任务的部队，复员转业军人，军烈属以及全国同胞，致以最热烈的祝贺！
    1958年，全国人民在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，取得了工农业生产的辉煌胜利，全国各个战线都出现了轰轰烈烈的大跃进局面。这一年，全国农村开展了波澜壮阔的人民公社化运动，这一运动的发展，推动着各项建设事业的迅速前进。人们的干劲冲天，精神面貌也日益改变，社会主义和共产主义觉悟有了很大的提高。中国人民解放军为全国大跃进的形势和人民群众的冲天干劲所鼓舞，投身于跃进的行列，并在大跃进的高潮中，受到了极其深刻、极其丰富的教育。
    一年来，我军各个部队，经过整风运动，经过来自人民群众的教育，特别是进一步贯彻了党和毛主席的建军思想，使我军在各个方面，都出现了更加生动活泼的政治局面。干部的思想、作风有了很大的进步，尤其是实行干部下连当兵的措施以来，官兵之间、上下之间的关系更加融洽了，团结更加紧密了。这样，在军事训练，对敌斗争，以及其它各项任务的执行中，都获得了极其显著的成绩。1958年，各个部队还积极参加了社会主义建设事业。全军人员全年参加社会主义建设的义务劳动日较1957年超过两倍。去年春天开始，各地区部队积极参加修建大小水利工程约二万多项，例如北京的十三陵水库，辽宁的浑沙总干渠，哈尔滨的松花江大堤，南京的黄马水库，陕西的龙潭水渠，昆明的明朗水库等工程。在钢铁战线上，部队曾抽出人力帮助冶炼，抽出车辆帮助运输。除此以外，各地区部队还参加了抢收、抢种和防洪、抗旱的活动。在人民公社运动中，部队组织人员，在地方党委统一领导下，协助公社举办集体福利事业，帮助训练民兵骨干，受到人民群众的极大欢迎。事实证明，这样做不仅直接有助于社会主义建设事业，而且可以使军队的同志密切联系人民群众，增强军队同地方、军队同人民群众之间的团结；可以使军队的同志更多地受到来自人民群众的教育，学得生产知识和地方工作经验，提高共产主义觉悟，提高工作能力。这对增强我军的战斗力有极大的意义。
    一年来，我军各部队在所驻地区的党委领导下，得到了人民群众人力、物力的巨大支援和精神上的鼓励。特别是在福建前线和边防地区，人民对军队的支援和爱护，真是做到了有求必应，无微不至。正因为有了人民的支援，有了军民之间这样坚如磐石的团结，军队的各项任务才得以顺利地完成。我们谨向各地党委、政府和全国同胞表示最大的敬意！同志们，以拥护人民公社为中心内容的春节拥政爱民活动，已经开始了。全体同志应当积极响应总政治部的号召，坚决执行总政治部的指示，做出显著的成绩。这项工作做好了，不仅会大大地增强军民关系，而且将大大促进我军1959年训练以及各项工作的跃进。全体同志应当继续深入学习党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，通过鸣放辩论、参观访问以及直接帮助人民公社进行工作等，提高理论和政策水平，确立对人民公社的正确态度。在拥政爱民的活动中，还要开展广泛深入的宣传工作，通过贺年、联欢、座谈等活动，向驻地居民宣传1958年大跃进的成绩，宣传人民公社的优越性，宣传积肥造肥运动对今年农业增产的重要意义。同时，还要教育和鼓励自己的亲属，热爱人民公社，积极参加人民公社的生产建设事业，做一个人民公社的好社员。
    我们还应当把帮助人民公社的工作和参加社会主义建设工作经常化起来。在坚决完成自己的战备和训练等任务的条件下，同全国人民一道，为巩固人民公社，发展人民公社的各项工作而努力。如参加农田水利工程建设，参加当地季节性的农业生产劳动和植树造林，抢险救灾，开展文化教育卫生工作，帮助训练民兵等等，这些，在驻地附近都是可以进行的。
    同志们，我们是社会主义的保卫者，又是社会主义的建设者，是战斗队，又是工作队。我们一定要保持和发扬人民军队的优良传统，并把自己看成是一个普通劳动者，以平等诚恳、谦虚的态度对待人民群众，严格遵守群众纪律，和人民群众保持亲密团结。这是我们胜利的源泉。目前，国际形势对我们空前有利，敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营更加强大，苏联的经济建设以及科学文化有着空前巨大的发展，苏共第二十一次代表大会所提出的建设共产主义的宏伟计划，更加振奋人心；拉丁美洲和非洲的民族解放运动，如星火燎原，正蓬勃发展。帝国主义阵营矛盾重重，它们到处碰壁，日益陷于四分五裂的境地。但是我们必须看到帝国主义是要作垂死挣扎的，它们现在还到处进行阴谋活动，制造紧张局势。美帝国主义现在还霸占着我国的领土台湾，在台湾海峡制造紧张局势，因此我军必须保持高度警惕，加强战备、训练和各项工作的建设，进一步增强军民团结，为捍卫祖国的社会主义建设事业，为粉碎敌人的侵略阴谋而奋斗！
