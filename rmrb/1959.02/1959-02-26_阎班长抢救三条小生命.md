　　Four-year-old Guihua from Aoshan Street Village in Jimo County, Shandong Province, followed her mother to her maternal grandmother's house. One day, she, her ten-year-old aunt, and another child were playing by the large reservoir at the village entrance. Guihua loved playing with water at home. Seeing the reservoir full of water, she happily ran over, and accidentally plunged into the water. Guihua’s friend tried to pull her up, but lost her footing and also slipped into the deep water. The aunt was so scared that she cried loudly, and when she went to rescue them, she also slipped down.

　　The three children were about to lose their lives. Coincidentally, Yan Qingming, a squad leader from the People's Liberation Army motor vehicle company, came to wash clothes. Seeing the three children fall into the water, he didn't bother to take off his clothes, and forgot that he couldn't float. He jumped into the reservoir with a "thud," disappearing from sight and gulping down three or four mouthfuls of water. Feeling around in the water, he first rescued Guihua's aunt, and then lifted Guihua's friend out of the water. At this point, he had swallowed too much water and was a little flustered, but he was still clear-headed. He thought: I would rather risk my own life to save the last child. The half-drowned Guihua suddenly grabbed onto a head, and clung tightly to Squad Leader Yan. In his moment of desperation, Squad Leader Yan had a flash of inspiration. He pried open her little hands, grabbed her calf, drank a few more mouthfuls of water, and pushed Guihua ashore. However, Squad Leader Yan could no longer climb out.

　　Uncle Liu, who was turning grass in the vegetable garden, heard the children calling for help and rushed over with a bamboo rake. Seeing a hand sticking out of the water, he reached out the rake to rescue him. In his desperation, Squad Leader Yan felt something in his hand, grabbed Uncle Liu's bamboo rake, and the rescuer was also saved.

　　Guihua's maternal grandmother and mother arrived. The elders of the village also arrived. People looked at Squad Leader Yan lying on the ground, vomiting muddy water, and the three children he had saved, and tears of gratitude flowed from their eyes. The elders flocked to the company headquarters to commend Squad Leader Yan. Guihua's mother said that Squad Leader Yan had saved Guihua's life, and wanted Guihua to recognize Squad Leader Yan as her godfather. Squad Leader Yan was so embarrassed that he refused to agree. He said, "This is what I should do."

    阎班长抢救三条小生命
    新华社记者　姜文品
    山东省即墨县鳌山街村四岁的小桂花，跟着妈妈来到姥姥家。一天，她和十岁的小姨和另一个小朋友一块儿在村头大水库旁边玩耍。小桂花在家就喜欢玩水。一看大水库盛了满满的水，就欢喜地奔过去，一不小心，扑通栽入水中。桂花的小朋友赶上去拉她，没站稳脚也溜进深水。小姨吓得咧着大嘴哭叫，赶去抢救时自己又滑了下去。
    三个孩子眼看就没命啦。赶巧，解放军汽车连的班长阎清明来洗衣服。他看到三个孩子落了水，没顾得脱衣服，更忘了自己不会浮水，“嗵”的一声跳进水库，不露头了，咕咚咕咚喝了三、四口水。他在水里摸着先救上了桂花的小姨，接着又将桂花的小朋友托出水面。这时，他喝水太多，有些慌，但心里还明白。他想：宁肯豁上自己的生命，也要把最后一个小孩救出来。被淹得半死的小桂花，忽而捞到一个人头，就紧扒在阎班长的身上。阎班长急中生智，扒开她的小手，抓住她的小腿，又喝了几口水，把小桂花拥上岸。可是，阎班长这时再也爬不出来了。
    正在场园翻草的刘大伯，听到孩子呼救，提着竹耙赶来，见水面露着一只人手，伸过耙去搭救。在绝望中的阎班长觉着手里触到一物，抓着刘大伯的竹耙，这个救人的人也得救了。
    桂花的姥姥和妈妈赶来了。村上的父老也赶来了。人们望着躺在地上呕吐浊水的阎班长和三个被他救活的孩子，都流出了感激的眼泪。父老们拥到连部给阎班长请功。桂花的妈妈说，阎班长给桂花留下这条命，让桂花拜阎班长为干爹。阎班长羞的怎么也不肯答应。他说，“这是我应做的事。”
