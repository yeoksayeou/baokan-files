Popularizing Secondary and Higher Education Among Officers, Popularizing Higher Elementary Education Among Soldiers
PLA Officers and Soldiers Vigorously Assault the Cultural Fortress

(Our dispatch) The People’s Liberation Army's cultural education work has entered a new stage with the goals of popularizing higher elementary education among soldiers and popularizing secondary and higher education among officers. Currently, all officers and soldiers are vigorously assaulting new cultural courses while defending the motherland and supporting national construction.

In 1958, while achieving significant accomplishments in defending the motherland, conducting military and political training, and supporting national construction, the Chinese People's Liberation Army also launched a Great Leap Forward movement on the cultural education front and achieved a great harvest. This Great Leap Forward began with literacy campaigns for soldiers. By the end of the year, according to statistics from some units, more than 90% of the original illiterate soldiers had basically shed their illiteracy and began to advance towards higher elementary levels. Those who had reached higher elementary levels were advancing towards junior high school courses. In the literacy campaigns, many soldiers not only studied during regular class time but also "learned wherever they went" and "learned for every minute they had." Without instructors, they "used the higher-level to teach the lower-level and the stronger to lead the weaker." Many leading cadres personally served as instructors. In one company, forty-seven new soldiers were illiterate. The company cadres divided the work and took responsibility for specific individuals, first focusing on those with a higher literacy level and then adopting the method of using the strong to lead the weak, teaching as they learned. Those who knew five hundred characters taught those who knew two hundred characters, and those who knew two hundred characters taught those who knew one hundred characters. In this way, they basically completed the literacy task in just over two months. On the basis of literacy, all units in the army universally launched poetry-writing activities, which played a significant role in further consolidating and improving literacy achievements. Soldier Yang Zhijun from a certain unit wrote a letter to his wife for the first time after becoming literate. His wife, who had also just shed her illiteracy in the countryside, immediately wrote him back. After receiving the letter, Yang wrote a poem expressing his feelings: "A couple were illiterate, unable to speak their hearts, since the general line arrived, the mute has spoken after many years."

With the development of the soldier literacy work, a new upsurge in cultural learning among cadres has also emerged. In particular, the General Political Department's proposal in November last year to popularize secondary and higher education among cadres was warmly welcomed by the vast majority of cadres. Zhang Bingxue, a battalion commander in a certain unit, was approved by the organization to take a rest. When he heard that he needed to study culture, he gave up his rest and asked to participate in cultural learning. Leaders at all levels also attached great importance to this and specifically convened Party committees to conduct serious research. They made plans, and leading organs at and above the regimental level established cultural education offices. Party committees at all levels also assigned a standing committee member to oversee cultural and educational work. Under the leadership of Party committees and political organs at all levels, mass-based schooling was launched everywhere. Various cultural spare-time schools sprang up like mushrooms after a rain. According to statistics from several units in the Shenyang area alone, twenty spare-time universities and forty-three middle schools were established in December last year, with more than 90% of the cadres participating in the studies. These schools mostly combined teaching classes with basic administrative units (such as companies and platoons in the army, departments, offices, and sections in the organs). This made the teaching classes small, with fewer people, which facilitated individualized instruction and the use of work gaps for learning. The contradiction between work and study was relatively easy to resolve. In addition to using holidays, festivals, and rest time, many cadres also seized various gaps, such as the gaps before meetings, while traveling on trains and in cabins, and in waiting rooms, to study. Su Jian, the director of the political department of a certain division, did this for seven years, learning all the junior and senior high school mathematics, physics, chemistry, and basic Darwinism, as well as university advanced mathematics and analytical geometry, from his original first-year junior high school level. In addition, he also read the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, the textbook of Political Economy, and studied philosophy according to the outline of the Advanced Party School. Cadres of a certain organ of the Shanghai Garrison Command spent an average of three to four hours studying every day at noon and in the evening, often putting down their bowls to study, with books and exercises in their pockets. They studied and discussed at all times, either doing exercises or casually discussing.

Based on the characteristics of cadres in active service, many units adopted the method of making single-subject breakthroughs in several courses, consolidating one section after a period of intense study, and consolidating the dispersed subjects after the concentrated push. The purpose of the intensive study was to understand rather than to seek precision, and then to further consolidate and deepen through self-study. This concentrated time and energy, quickly mastered a course in a short period, and immediately saw results, increasing the confidence in learning and thus accelerating the progress of teaching. The teaching methods adopted were refined lectures with ample practice, a combination of lectures and practice, and a multi-faceted combination with military, political, and other activities such as life, reading extensively, writing extensively, performing extensively, calculating extensively, and using extensively. In solving the problem of insufficient teachers, each unit fully utilized the role of existing full-time teachers and also selected a large number of part-time teachers from cadres and soldiers according to the principle of "the able are teachers, using the higher-level to teach the lower-level." Some units also received strong assistance from local universities and middle schools. Guilin Normal College sent nearly a hundred teachers and students to teach the cadres of one division culture for seventeen days. A certain unit stationed in Beijing also received assistance from Normal University.

Based on the above situation, the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army recently summarized the experience of cultural education work and formulated a grand plan, requiring that within ten years from this year, most cadres reach the level of higher education in professional knowledge according to their professional needs. The first step in realizing this plan is to spend three or four years to bring all cadres who have not yet reached the junior high school graduation level to junior high school graduation. Then enter higher vocational studies. The General Political Department also proposed that the method of study should be mainly on-the-job. Study must take into account the work, and the study should be organized rhythmically according to the law of busy and slack periods of work. The principle of studying more in leisure time, studying less in busy time, temporarily stopping study in tense time, and continuing study after tense time should be implemented to ensure that work and study are not delayed. The content of study should be closely combined with the cadres' work to achieve consistency between learning and application. In terms of learning organization, various methods such as spare-time cultural supplementary schools, self-study, rotation training, as well as going to school to study, participating in local night schools, and running correspondence courses should be adopted, and a teaching network should be formed with regions or troops as units to unify management. The main targets for popularizing higher education are young and middle-aged people among the cadres. People over the age of forty are not subject to uniform requirements.

Now the People's Liberation Army is carrying out cultural education in accordance with this plan. The learning enthusiasm of all officers and soldiers is very high, and the trend of subscribing to newspapers and periodicals, buying books, talking about science, and seeking knowledge has become a climax. "Go all out, persevere" is their slogan. Ten years to see three years, three years to see the first year, 1959 is the first year of realizing this grand plan for universal education, they are determined to work hard and lay a good foundation. To achieve newer and greater victories in capturing the cultural and scientific fortress.

    在军官中普及中等高等教育　在士兵中普及高小教育
    解放军官兵猛攻文化堡垒
    本报讯　在士兵中普及高小教育，在军官中普及中等和高等教育的奋斗目标，已将人民解放军的文化教育工作带到了一个新的阶段。现在全军官兵正在捍卫祖国和支援国家建设的同时，奋勇猛攻新的文化课程。
    1958年，中国人民解放军在保卫祖国，进行军事政治训练和支援国家建设取得重大成就的同时，在文化教育战线上也掀起了一个大跃进的运动，获得了大丰收。这个大跃进首先是从士兵扫盲开始的。到年底为止，据一些部队的统计，原来的文盲已经有90％以上，基本上摘掉了文盲帽子，并开始向高小进军。原来达到高小程度的，正向初中课程进军。在扫盲中许多士兵不仅在正课时间学习！而且“走到哪里，学到哪里”，“有一分钟，学一分钟”。没有教员，就“以高教低，以强带弱”，许多领导干部都亲自担任教员。某连四十七个新战士是文盲，连干部就分工包干，先突击文盲中识字较多的，然后采取以强带弱，现学现教的办法，识五百字的教识二百字的，识二百字的教识一百字的，这样只花了两个多月的时间基本上完成了扫盲任务。在扫盲的基础上，全军各个部队都普遍展开了写诗的活动，这对于进一步巩固和提高扫盲成绩，也起了很大作用。某部士兵杨智君，扫盲后第一次写了一封信给他爱人，他爱人在农村也刚摘掉文盲帽子，当即给他写了回信，杨接信后还写了一首诗表示自己的心情：“一对夫妻是文盲，知心话儿没法讲，自从来了总路线，多年哑吧开了腔”。
    随着士兵扫盲工作的开展，干部的文化学习也出现了新高潮。特别是总政治部去年11月提出在干部中普及中等和高等教育的倡议，受到了广大干部的热烈欢迎，某部营长张丙学组织上批准他去休养，他听说要学文化，就放弃休养要求参加文化学习。各级领导也十分重视，专门召开党委会作了认真的研究。作出了规划，团以上各级领导机关都成立了文化教育办公室，各级党委还分工有一名常委掌管文教工作。在各级党委和政治机关领导下，群众办学到处展开，各种文化业余学校如雨后春笋，仅据沈阳地区若干部队的统计，在去年12月间就办了业余大学二十所，中学四十三所，参加学习的人占干部总数90％以上。这些学校大都把教学班和基层行政单位（如部队的营连，机关的部、处、科）结合一致，这样教学班小，人数少，便于因人施教和利用工作间隙学习，工作与学习的矛盾比较容易解决。不少干部除了利用假日、节日和休息时间外，还抓紧了各种间隙，如开会前的间隙，外出在火车上、船舱里、候车室里进行学习。某师政治部主任苏鉴就这样七年如一日，从原来的初中一年级程度，学完了初中和高中的数学、物理、化学、达尔文主义基础，大学的高等数学和解析几何，此外还读了毛泽东选集，政治经济学教科书，并按高级党校的提纲学了哲学。上海警备部队某机关干部用中午和晚上每天平均学习三、四小时，经常是放下饭碗就学习，书本习题装在口袋里。时时研究时时谈，不是做习题就是漫谈讨论。
    根据在职干部的特点，许多部队对于若干课程采取了单门突进，突击一段巩固一段，集中突击分散巩固的办法。突击的目的是求懂不求精，然后进一步通过自修复习来巩固加深。这样就时间集中，精力集中，短期学会一门课程，立竿见影，提高了学习信心，因而加快了教学的进度。在教学方法上采用了精讲多练，讲练结合，并和军事、政治、生活等各方面活动多边结合，大读、大写、大演、大算、大用。在解决教员不足的问题上，各部队除了充分发挥现有专职教员的作用外，还按“能者为师，以高教低”的原则从干部和战士中挑选了大量兼职教员。有的部队还得到了地方大、中学的大力协助。桂林师范学院曾派出了师生近百人包教一个师的干部学文化十七天。驻京某部队，也得到了师范大学的协助。
    根据上述情况，人民解放军总政治部最近总结了文化教育工作的经验后，制定了一个宏大的规划，要求从今年起，以十年时间做到使大多数干部，按照本人的业务需要，在专业知识方面达到高等教育的水平。实现这个规划的第一步是先用三、四年的时间使所有尚未达到初中毕业程度的干部达到初中毕业。然后进入高等专科的学习，总政治部同时提出，学习的方法应以在职为主。学习必须照顾工作，应该根据各个时期工作忙闲紧松的规律，有节奏地组织学习，实行闲时多学、忙时少学、紧张时暂时停学、紧张过后继续学的原则，做到工作与学习两不误。学习内容要与干部的业务紧密结合，做到学用一致。在学习组织上要采取业余文化补习学校、自修、轮训以及进学校学习、参加地方夜校、举办函授等多种方式并举，按地区或部队为单位组成教学网，统一加以管理。普及高等教育的主要对象是干部中的青壮年，年过四十的人，不作统一要求。
    现在人民解放军正按照这个规划，大搞文化教育。全军官兵的学习情绪十分高昂，订报刊买书籍，讲科学，求知识之风成了高潮。“鼓足干劲，持之以恒”是他们的口号。十年看三年，三年看头年，1959年是实现这个普及教育宏图大业的第一年，他们决心奋发努力，打好基础。在攻占文化科学堡垒方面获得更新更大的胜利。
