Mass Production of Rice Transplanters
    Overcome Labor Shortages

    Wu Ning County in Jiangxi Province has more land than labor, and every year during the spring plowing season, it feels the pinch of labor shortages, making it difficult to manage. Especially during the rice transplanting stage, even with great efforts to concentrate transplanting, it still falls behind the agricultural season. The Wu Ning County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to change this situation in this year's spring production. What's the clever plan? Nothing else, it's still grasping tool reform. They decided to manufacture 7,200 rice transplanters before early April. Since December of last year, they have transferred 204 iron and woodworking workers with better skills from various parts of the county to concentrate on manufacturing the "Red Flag No. 1" rice transplanter. After more than a month of hard work, 473 units have now been produced; materials have been prepared for more than 300 units. It is estimated that the task can be completed in early April. According to the county's early rice planting area this year, there can be one rice transplanter for every 34 mu of land. According to dense planting requirements, 40,000 to 60,000 seedlings per mu, each rice transplanter can transplant more than 4 mu per day. In this way, the county's early rice transplanting task can be completed in more than eight days. Not only can it catch up with the season, but it can also save a large number of laborers to do other farm work.

    大量制造插秧机
    突破劳力不足关
    江西武宁县地多劳力少，历年春耕季节都感到劳力不足，忙不过来。特别是插秧这个阶段，虽然用了很大力量集中插秧，仍然有些赶不上农时。中共武宁县委决定在今年春季生产中改变这种状况。有何妙计？没别的，还是抓工具改革。他们决定，在4月上旬以前制造七千二百部插秧机。从去年12月起，就在县内各地抽调了二百零四个技术较好的铁业木业工人，集中制造“红旗一号”插秧机。大干了一个多月，现在已经制成四百七十三部；备好材料的还有三百多部。预计4月上旬可以全部完成任务。按全县今年早稻播种面积计算，每三十四亩田可以有一部插秧机。照密植要求，每亩四万至六万蔸，每部插秧机每天可插四亩多。这样，全县早稻插秧任务八天多就可以完成。不但能赶上季节，还可节省出大批劳动力做别的农活。
