    Defend the Great Achievements of Construction
    -- Written for the 41st Anniversary of the Founding of the Soviet Army
    Marshal of the Soviet Union, K. A. Meretskov
    The Soviet people and their armed forces are celebrating the 41st anniversary of the founding of the army with great patriotic and labor enthusiasm. The historically significant 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has just concluded. Millions of people in the world's first socialist country, the working people of various people's democratic countries, and other countries are excitedly discussing the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This congress is a congress of communist builders, marking the entry of our country into a new historical period – the period of comprehensively unfolding the construction of a communist society.

    The resolutions of the Congress summarized the outstanding achievements of our country's socialist construction, put forward a program for the comprehensive development of communist construction, and revealed the prospects for the development of Soviet society.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet Union has become a powerful socialist country with advanced industry and collectivized agriculture, with its industrial output ranking first in Europe and second in the world. Socialism in the Soviet Union has not only completely triumphed, but has also thoroughly triumphed. Soviet science and technology have reached unprecedented prosperity. The launch of three artificial earth satellites and the world's first cosmic rocket has proven the high level of Soviet technological development. No other country in the world has achieved such technological accomplishments.

    Soviet workers are now facing extremely grand tasks. In the next seven years, we should increase the total industrial output by about 80%. The planned production of major heavy industry products in 1965 is as follows: 65 million to 70 million tons of pig iron; 86 million to 91 million tons of steel; 65 million to 70 million tons of steel products; 230 million to 240 million tons of oil, more than doubling; and natural gas will reach 150 billion cubic meters, compared to 30 billion cubic meters in 1958. The Seven-Year Plan is a decisive stage in realizing Lenin's idea of ​​national electrification. Electricity production is planned to increase to 500 billion to 520 billion kilowatt-hours, which is 2.1 to 2.2 times that of 1958.

    During the same period, the total agricultural output is planned to increase by 70%.

    The Seven-Year Plan fully demonstrates the Communist Party's concern for further improving the welfare of the Soviet people. To this end, the plan stipulates the construction of approximately 15 million housing units in cities, workers' villages, state farms, and workers' residential areas of technical repair stations, and approximately 7 million houses in rural areas. The production of various daily necessities will increase by 50%-70% compared to 1958. It is also planned to greatly increase wages, mainly increasing the wages of low-wage workers, improving welfare guarantees, shortening the working day and working week, and many other measures. The main goal of the Seven-Year Plan is to ensure the further development of the national economy, improve the living standards of the people, and thereby win the victory over capitalist countries in peaceful competition.

    After the completion of the Seven-Year Plan, our country will become even stronger, and the lives of the Soviet people will be richer, better, and more prosperous.

    The Soviet people, our soldiers of the army and navy, are sincerely happy for the achievements made by the great Chinese people in industry, agriculture, science, culture, and education in a very short period. In 1958, China achieved particularly remarkable leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production. The figures on the development of major sectors of the Chinese national economy mentioned by Comrade Zhou Enlai in his speech at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union amazed the Soviet people. For example, in 1958, China's steel production reached 11 million tons, doubling that of 1957; the total grain output reached approximately 375 million tons, more than doubling that of 1957.

    A careful consideration of these figures makes it completely clear that the industrious Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, will certainly be able to turn the country into a powerful socialist country with advanced technology and culture in a relatively short period.

    The Seven-Year Plan approved by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is of great significance not only to the Soviet people but also to all progressive humanity.

    As N. S. Khrushchev pointed out in his report, "For the international workers' movement and the communist movement, for all democratic forces, our Seven-Year Plan is a powerful victory support in their struggle against reactionary forces and imperialism. The Soviet people's new victories in communist construction are fulfilling their internationalist responsibility to the international working class."

    The socialist system is now unprecedentedly consolidated, united, and unbreakable.

    The socialist world is exerting a decisive influence on the entire course of human development. The outstanding achievements of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all other socialist countries show how great a cause the working people who have mastered economic life and their own destiny can create.

    It is due to the heroic efforts of the people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in peaceful labor, and due to the unprecedented contribution of the armed forces of both countries in protecting the freedom and independence of their people from foreign enslavers, that socialism was able to win in the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China was able to achieve success in socialist construction.

    From the first day of its establishment, the Soviet armed forces have defended the achievements of the Great October Revolution. In the forty-one years of its existence, it has gloriously fulfilled its historical mission. This was the case during the Civil War, when the young, poorly equipped Red Army crushed the armies of the interventionists and internal counter-revolutionaries, and defended the great fruits achieved by our working class and poor peasants. This was also the case during the Great Patriotic War, when the brilliant victory of the Soviet armed forces under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union crushed the German fascist aggressors.

    The Soviet soldiers who grew up under the education of the Communist Party and who understood the great happiness of socialism, fought selflessly from the first day to the last day of the war to defend our just cause and the Soviet motherland. The victory of the Soviet armed forces in the Great Patriotic War was also the victory of our socialist system. The Soviet social and state system enabled us to mobilize all manpower and material resources to assist the army, which showed its superiority over capitalism not only in peaceful competition but also in war. We achieved economic, political-moral, and military victory over fascist Germany and its allies. The victory of the Soviet army was also the victory of Lenin's principles of organizing, training, and educating the army, as well as the victory of Soviet military science and Soviet military art.

    The soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, like the soldiers of the Soviet army, enjoy the immortal glory of fighting for freedom and national independence. We, the Soviet people, remember with admiration the great contribution of the Chinese people and their People's Liberation Army to our common cause in defeating Japanese imperialism, and we will always remember the heroism of the Chinese commanders and fighters in defending the interests of their motherland when their motherland was threatened.

    I participated in the campaign to crush the Japanese Kwantung Army in the Far East in August 1945, and I will never forget the glorious achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. At that time, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in close coordination with the Soviet army, successfully completed the task of crushing foreign invaders. As is well known, after the victory of the Chinese revolution in 1949, the enemies of peace and socialism repeatedly threatened the independence of the free Chinese people, but each time they were met with a deserved counterattack. The Korean War is a vivid example. At that time, the Chinese People's Volunteers, who were defending the inviolability of their national borders, fought shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army, crushing the plans of the American imperialists to invade the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China.

    We vividly remember the events in the Fujian front in 1958. In the battles against the Chiang Kai-shek elements and the American armed interventionists, the Chinese air force, navy, and artillery showed the world that they could strike the enemy with 100% accuracy.

    The Soviet army and navy personnel are overjoyed by the courage and heroism displayed by their Chinese friends in fighting against the enemies of their motherland.

    The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries have always adhered to a foreign policy of maintaining and consolidating the peace and security of all peoples, implementing the policy of stopping the "cold war" and easing international tensions, and fully consolidating the world socialist system and cooperation between brotherly peoples on the basis of Lenin's principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. It should be particularly pointed out that the Soviet government has recently put forward specific proposals for the peaceful settlement of the German issue, for reaching agreements on stopping testing and completely banning nuclear weapons, on disarmament, stopping the "cold war," and holding a summit meeting. Unfortunately, these proposals have not yet received the necessary support from the United States, Britain, France, and other Western countries. On the contrary, these countries, especially the United States, continue to engage in an arms race, establish new military bases around socialist countries, and set up special forces equipped with atomic weapons in Western Europe, Turkey, Greece, and other parts of the world. Not only that, the imperialists also provoke military conflicts in the Near East, the Middle East, and the Pacific region, use military action against the African people fighting for freedom, and often threaten the internal affairs of Latin American countries with military intervention. In recent years, only due to the firm position of the socialist camp countries and the peace-loving countries of the East, the seeds of war were extinguished when they first appeared in the Middle East and the Far East, and other conspiracies of the imperialists were also crushed.

    These circumstances make the struggle of all peace-loving people for the establishment of collective security and for the elimination of war as a means of resolving international disputes particularly urgent.

    At the same time, taking into account the current situation, the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp have taken the necessary measures to consolidate their national security and improve their defense capabilities, so as not to be caught off guard in the event of any accidental and sudden events.

    The international situation makes the Soviet military personnel remain vigilant at all times, maintaining a high degree of vigilance at all times and places, and resolutely dispelling the ideas of complacency and peace in the world. Our army and navy vigilantly watch the conspiracies of international reactionary forces and stubbornly improve their combat effectiveness.

    The Communist Party and the Soviet government are constantly paying attention to consolidating the defense capabilities of the Soviet state. The Soviet armed forces have first-class modern equipment and are constantly improving their organization and tactical training so that they can successfully solve complex combat tasks under the conditions of using weapons of mass destruction. If the imperialists provoke a major war, then modern large-scale war, whether on land, at sea, or in the air, will be conducted under very intense conditions, and the scope of the war will include not only the battlefield but also the entire rear of the belligerent countries. It is particularly important to estimate that the combat conditions have fundamentally changed with the possible use of weapons of mass destruction, rockets, jet weapons, and the use of new types of air force and other new combat tools. The factors that will play a large role in the war will be the technical level and morale of the armed forces, the combat training and skills of the troops, the military art of the supreme commander and commander, and the tactical training of officers will also be of great importance.

    For this reason, while arming the army and navy with new technologies, the Soviet armed forces also pay special attention to training commanding cadres and engineering and technical cadres, mainly through higher military schools. Generals and officers study the necessary theories on the use of new weapons in combat in schools. In addition to studying theoretical knowledge, engineering and technical cadres also carry out the necessary practice on the correct application of complex military technology under modern conditions. We are pleased to point out that representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are also successfully mastering military theory in Soviet higher military schools together with generals and officers of the Soviet army and navy. They study tactics, operational art, military technology, and other subjects with an insatiable and tenacious spirit.

    The study of Chinese comrades in Soviet schools strengthens the mutual ties between the friendly armies of the two countries and contributes to further consolidating the military cooperation and improving the combat power of our two countries' armed forces.

    When celebrating the glorious anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, Soviet military personnel are proud that the Soviet people, the Communist Party, and the Soviet government have entrusted them with a sacred task: to vigilantly defend the achievements of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The Soviet army and navy personnel believe that it is their greatest honor to respond to this high trust with new achievements in further improving military skills and improving combat training.

    保卫伟大的建设成果
    ——为苏联建军四十一周年而作
    苏联元帅　克·阿·麦列次科夫
    苏联人民及其武装部队在爱国主义热情和劳动热情巨大高涨的情况下来庆祝建军的四十一周年。具有历史意义的苏共第二十一次代表大会刚闭幕不久。世界上第一个社会主义国家的千百万人民，各人民民主国家和其他国家的劳动人民，都正欢欣鼓舞地讨论苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议。这次代表大会是共产主义建设者的大会，是标志着我国进入新的历史发展时期——全面展开共产主义社会建设时期的大会。
    在代表大会的决议中，总结了我国社会主义建设的卓越成就，提出了全面展开共产主义建设的纲领，揭示出苏维埃社会发展的远景。
    苏联在共产党领导下已成为强大的工业和集体农庄的社会主义国家，它的工业产量占欧洲第一位和世界第二位。社会主义在苏联不仅完全胜利了，而且是彻底胜利了。苏联的科学技术达到了空前的繁荣。三颗人造地球卫星和世界上第一个宇宙火箭的发射，证明了苏联技术发展的高度水平。世界上任何其他国家都没有达到这样技术上的成就。
    苏联劳动者现在面临着极其宏伟的任务。在未来的七年之间，我们应当使工业总产值增加约80％。规定重工业主要产品1965年的产量如下：生铁六千五百万吨至七千万吨；钢八千六百万吨至九千一百万吨；钢材六千五百万吨至七千万吨；石油二亿三千万吨至二亿四千万吨，即增加一倍以上；煤气达到一千五百亿立方公尺，而1958年为三百亿立方公尺。七年计划是实现列宁的国家全盘电气化思想的决定性阶段，电力生产规定要增加到五千亿至五千二百亿度，即增为1958年的二点一倍至二点二倍。
    在此同一时期，农业总产值规定要增加70％。
    七年计划充分表现出共产党对进一步提高苏联人民福利的关怀，为此，计划规定在城市、工人村、国营农场和技术修理站工人居住区建筑约一千五百万套住房，而在农村建筑约七百万所住房。各种日用品的生产将比1958年增加50％—70％。还规定大大提高工资，主要是提高低工资的职工的工资，将改善优抚保证，缩短工作日和工作周以及许多其他措施。在七年计划中，主要的是保证国家经济的进一步发展，提高人民的生活水平，并以此在和平竞赛中取得对资本主义国家的胜利。
    七年计划完成后，我国将更加强大，苏联人民的生活也将更加丰富、美好和富足。
    苏联人，我们的陆海军战士们为伟大的中国人民在很短的时期在工农业、科学、文化和教育方面所获得的成就而感到衷心地高兴。1958年中国在工农业生产方面实现了特别显著的跃进。周恩来同志在苏共第二十一次代表大会上发言时谈到的中国国民经济主要部门发展的数字，使苏联人赞叹不止，例如，1958年中国钢产量达到一千一百万吨，比1957年增加一倍；粮食总产量约达三亿七千五百万吨，即比1957年增加一倍以上。
    仔细考虑一下这些数字，就会完全清楚，勤劳的中国人民在共产党的领导下一定能够在较短的时期把国家变成一个具有先进技术和文化的强大的社会主义国家。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会所批准的七年计划，不仅对苏联人民具有重大意义，对全体进步人类都具有重大意义。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在报告中指出，“对于国际工人运动和共产主义运动来说，对于一切民主力量来说，我们的七年计划是它们在同反动势力和帝国主义斗争中的一个强大的胜利支持。苏联人民在共产主义建设中得到新的胜利就是执行自己对国际工人阶级所负的国际主义责任。”
    社会主义体系现在已空前巩固、团结一致和牢不可破。
    社会主义世界对于整个人类发展进程起着决定性的影响。苏联、中华人民共和国和其他所有社会主义国家的卓越成就表明，已主宰了经济生活和自己命运的劳动人民能够创造出多么伟大的事业。
    由于苏联和中华人民共和国两国人民在和平劳动中的英勇努力，由于两国武装力量在保卫本国人民的自由与独立不受外国奴役者的侵犯方面所作的史无前例的贡献，才使社会主义能够在苏联获得胜利，中华人民共和国能够在社会主义建设中取得成就。
    苏联的武装力量从它建立的第一天起就捍卫着伟大十月革命的成果，在其存在的四十一年中，它光荣地执行着自己的历史使命。在内战期间就是如此，当时年青的、装备很坏的红军粉碎了干涉者的军队和内部反革命，保卫了我国工人阶级和贫农取得的伟大果实。在卫国战争期间也是如此，当时由于苏联共产党领导的苏联武装力量的辉煌胜利，粉碎了德国法西斯侵略军。
    在共产党教育下成长起来的、认识到社会主义的巨大幸福的苏军战士，从战争爆发的第一天到最后一天，一直在忘我地为保卫我们的正义事业和苏维埃祖国而战斗。苏联武装力量在卫国战争中取得的胜利，也就是我们社会主义制度的胜利。苏联的社会制度和国家制度使我们能够动员全部人力和物力来协助军队，这表明了它不仅在和平竞赛中比资本主义优越，而且在战争中也是一样。我们获得了在经济上、政治道义上和军事上对法西斯德国及其盟国的胜利。苏军的胜利也是列宁的组织训练和教育军队的原则的胜利，也是苏联军事科学、苏联军事艺术的胜利。
    中国人民解放军的战士们，也像苏军战士一样，享有争取自由和祖国独立的永垂不朽的光荣。我们苏联人民怀着钦佩的心情永远记得中国人民及其人民解放军在击溃日本帝国主义时给我们的共同事业带来的巨大贡献，永远记得中国指战员在祖国受到威胁时保卫自己祖国利益的那种英雄气概。
    我参加过1945年8月在远东粉碎日本关东军的战役，我永远不会忘记中国人民解放军的光辉战绩。当时中国人民解放军在同苏军的紧密配合下顺利完成了粉碎外国侵略者的任务。如所周知，在1949年中国革命胜利以后，和平和社会主义的敌人曾屡次威胁自由中国人民的独立，但是每一次都遭到了应有的反击。朝鲜事件就是一个鲜明的例子，当时保卫本国边界的不可侵犯性的中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民军，并肩粉碎了侵犯朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的美国帝国主义分子的计划。
    1958年福建前线的事件我们记忆犹新。在同蒋介石分子和美国武装干涉者的战斗中，中国的空军、海军和炮兵向全世界表明，他们能够百发百中地打击敌人。
    苏联的陆海军人员为中国朋友在同祖国的敌人作战中表现出的勇敢和英雄主义感到欢欣鼓舞。
              ×　×　×
    苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家始终不渝地奉行这样的对外政策：在列宁关于不同社会制度的国家和平共处的原则的基础上，维护和巩固各国人民的和平与安全，实行制止“冷战”和缓和国际紧张局势的方针，全力巩固世界社会主义体系和兄弟人民间的合作。特别应当指出的是，苏联政府最近提出了有关和平解决德国问题，有关在停止试验和完全禁止核武器、在裁减军备、停止“冷战”以及召开政府首脑会议等方面达成协议的具体建议。遗憾的是，这些建议现在还没有得到美国、英国、法国和其他西方国家的应有的支持。恰恰相反，这些国家，特别是美国仍然继续进行军备竞赛，并在社会主义国家周围建立新的军事基地，在西欧、土耳其、希腊和世界其他地区设置配备有原子武器的特种部队。不但如此，帝国主义者还在近东、中东和太平洋地区挑起军事冲突，用军事行动反对非洲为自由而斗争的人民，并且经常以军事干涉来威胁拉丁美洲国家的内政。近几年来，只是由于社会主义阵营各国和东方爱好和平国家的坚定立场，当战争的苗头在中近东和远东初露的时候就被扑灭了，帝国主义者的其他阴谋也同样被粉碎了。
    这些情况使各国爱好和平的人民争取建立集体安全、争取消除把战争当作解决国际争端的手段的斗争，格外迫切了。
    同时，苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家考虑到目前情况，在巩固本国的安全和提高国防能力方面采取了必要的措施，为的是在遇到任何偶然和突然事件时不致措手不及。
    国际局势使得苏联军人时刻戒备着，使他们随时随地保持高度的警惕性，并且坚决驱除自安自慰和天下太平的思想。我们的陆军和海军机警地注视着国际反动势力的阴谋诡计，并在顽强地提高自己的战斗力。
    共产党和苏联政府时刻注意巩固苏维埃国家的国防能力。苏联武装力量拥有头等现代化装备，不断改善自己的组织和战术训练，以便在使用大规模杀伤武器的条件下能够顺利解决复杂的战斗任务。如果帝国主义者挑起大战的话，那么现代大规模战争无论在陆地、海洋或空中都将在非常紧张的情况下进行，并且战争范围不仅包括战场，也包括交战国家的全部大后方。特别重要的是要估计到，在有可能使用大规模杀伤武器、火箭、喷气武器和运用新型空军和其他新战斗工具的情况下，作战条件有了根本变化。战争中起很大作用的将是这些因素：武装力量的技术水平和士气，部队的战斗训练和技能，最高总指挥和统帅的军事艺术，军官的战术训练也将具有十分重要的意义。
    正因如此，在以新技术武装陆军和海军的同时，苏联武装力量也特别注意培养指挥干部和工程技术干部，这主要是通过高等军事学校来进行。将军和军官们在学校里学习有关作战中使用新型武器问题的必要的理论。工程技术干部除了学习理论知识以外，也进行有关在现代条件下正确运用复杂军事技术的必要的实践。我们高兴地指出，中国人民解放军的代表也同苏联陆海军的将军和军官们一起，在苏联高等军事学校里顺利地掌握军事理论。他们以好学不厌的顽强精神钻研战术、作战艺术、军事技术和其他科目。
    中国同志们在苏联学校里学习，这就加强了两国友好军队间的相互联系，并且为进一步巩固我们两国武装力量的军事合作和提高战斗威力作出了贡献。

    苏联军人在庆祝苏联光辉的建军节的时候，引以自豪的是，苏联人民、共产党和苏联政府委托给他们一项神圣的任务：机警地保卫伟大十月社会主义革命的成果。苏联陆海军人员认为，以在进一步改善军事技巧和提高战斗训练中的新成就来回答这种高度的信任，是自己最大的荣誉。
