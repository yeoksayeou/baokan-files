    Greatly Increase Chemical Products

    In 1959, the comprehensive and greater leap forward of China's national economy requires that the chemical industry must also have a greater leap forward in order to meet the needs of the development of production and construction in various sectors of the national economy, the development of science and technology, and the growing needs of the people's lives.

    The chemical industry is a production sector with multiple industries, multiple varieties, and serving various sectors of the national economy. Just within the scope managed by the central Ministry of Chemical Industry, it includes sixteen industries, one hundred and sixteen categories, and more than twenty-six thousand varieties. The chemical industry is a raw material industrial sector, supplying tens of thousands of chemical raw materials and finished products to heavy industry, light industry, agriculture, transportation, and national defense industry as materials, raw materials, and auxiliary raw materials, or directly used to assemble machines, or directly supplied to meet the needs of people's lives. Therefore, it is not only inseparably linked to industrial and agricultural production, but also extremely closely related to the people's clothing, food, housing, transportation, culture, education, sports, health and other aspects. With the development of the national economy, science and technology, and the improvement of people's lives, various aspects require more and more chemical industrial products. The chemical industry undertakes the major task of creating various new synthetic materials for the country, promoting the technological transformation of the national economy, strengthening national defense capabilities, accelerating the development of the latest technologies, and also providing the people with a rich and diverse range of daily necessities.

    What are the connections between chemical products and industrial and agricultural production and people's lives?

    In heavy industry, the metallurgical industry, from mining, ore dressing, smelting to rolling into materials, requires many kinds of chemical products. Mining requires explosives, steelmaking requires soda ash to remove sulfur, and steel rolling requires sulfuric acid to remove rust. Non-ferrous metals and rare metals require a variety of chemical products for ore dressing and purification. Transmission devices in transportation, industrial and mining enterprises also require a large number of rubber products. The metal processing industry and metal cutting require calcium carbide, and the welding rods for welding metals require various chemical products as raw materials for welding flux. Motor manufacturing requires a variety of plastics as insulation materials. Machines, ships, vehicles, and airplanes require a large amount of paint, plastics, and rubber products. With the development of technology, more and more inexpensive and high-performance plastics will be used to replace metal materials in the machinery manufacturing industry. The application of plastics in the aviation industry is also becoming more and more widespread. A large jet airliner requires one hundred and twenty thousand plastic-made components and parts. In addition, industries such as electricity, coal, petroleum, construction, geology, and forestry require many chemical products.

    The chemical industry serves light industry even more extensively, and it is extremely closely related to daily consumer goods. The textile industry requires chemical products such as soda ash, caustic soda, sulfur, dyes, detergents, liquid chlorine, and bleaching powder; the paper industry and the food industry require chemical products such as soda ash, caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, borax, and dry ice. We only need to take a look in department stores to find that there are hardly any items that are not related to the chemical industry. Monosodium glutamate and soy sauce production require a large amount of hydrochloric acid; candy requires spices and saccharin; soap requires hardened oil, caustic soda, and spices; toothpaste requires magnesium carbonate, soda ash, caustic soda, spices, and stearic acid; matches require potassium chlorate and red phosphorus; the dazzling array of glassware and enamelware cannot be produced without chemical raw materials such as soda ash and boric acid; fountain pen barrels are made of plastic; the unbreakable "glass" of watches is made of plexiglass; beautiful "glass" stockings and rayon are woven from chemical fibers; raincoats, tablecloths, leather bags, and leather shoes are also often made of plastic. Other items such as nipples, thermos bottles, light bulbs, dry batteries, ink, printing ink, photographic film, photosensitive materials, bicycles, musical instruments, radios, cameras, records, soda water, biscuits, cigarettes, toys, buttons, toothbrushes, combs, Western medicine, sanitary products, etc., all require chemical products. If chemical products cannot guarantee their raw materials, it will hinder the production of these products, thereby directly affecting people's daily lives. Especially pharmaceutical products, which directly serve the people's health, are even more important. From this, we can see how broad and close the connection between people's lives and the chemical industry is.

    Agriculture requires a large amount of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Transportation requires a large amount of rubber products. The national defense industry and cutting-edge technology require a wide variety of new chemical products, high-energy fuels, and synthetic materials with special properties such as high temperature resistance, low temperature resistance, high strength, high insulation, corrosion resistance, abrasion resistance, and radiation resistance. These products are of utmost importance to the development of China's national defense industry and cutting-edge technology. These products not only have many characteristics that natural materials and certain metal materials do not have, but also have great economic significance. They can be manufactured using many waste materials, resulting in lower production costs. After World War II, industrialized countries rapidly developed the organic synthesis industry. The Soviet Union, in its new seven-year plan, made the development of the chemical industry a priority, investing the most capital in this industrial sector, which is enough to illustrate the important position and significance of the chemical industry in socialist construction.

    Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, China's chemical industry has developed rapidly. Especially in 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism and under the policy of taking steel as the key link and achieving a comprehensive leap forward, the chemical industry also made a great leap forward. The output of various major chemical products increased significantly compared to 1957. The output of soda ash increased by 29% compared to 1957, caustic soda increased by 31%, sulfuric acid increased by 19%, synthetic ammonia increased by 59%, ammonium nitrate increased by 157%, chemical fertilizers increased by 34%, calcium carbide increased by 44.6%, tires increased by 97%, and antibiotics increased by 334%. Such a rate of development had never been seen in any previous year. However, other heavy industry sectors grew even faster, and the great harvest in agriculture prepared resource conditions for a greater leap forward in light industry. Therefore, the growth in demand for chemical products from various sectors of heavy and light industry far exceeded the growth rate of chemical products themselves. At the same time, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the people's purchasing power also increased, and the needs of people's lives in various aspects grew significantly. Therefore, it is necessary to actively expand the production of chemical products to meet the needs of various sectors of the national economy.

    The great development of various sectors of the national economy requires the chemical industry to have a greater leap forward, which is one aspect. On the other hand, the chemical industry has the characteristics of multiple industries and multiple varieties, so its internal relationships are also very complex, with certain proportional relationships. Therefore, among the various industries within the chemical industry, between the raw material industry and the processing industry, between large-volume goods and small-quantity products, between old products and new products, between capital construction and production, between "large modern enterprises" and "small-scale indigenous enterprises," between general and cutting-edge, etc., all must develop correspondingly according to appropriate proportions. Under these circumstances, how to take overall consideration and make clever arrangements is a very important issue. This year's national plan has already made appropriate arrangements based on the above situation. The output of major chemical products will have a very large increase compared to last year. This year's chemical production plan is a great leap forward plan. The question now is how to muster all our energy and take twelve-part measures and twenty-four-part efforts to ensure the realization of this plan.

    Existing chemical enterprises are the main base for chemical production. Completing this year's production plan mainly relies on these enterprises. Therefore, it is necessary to organize a great leap forward in production in existing enterprises, and according to different situations, increase output by 20%, 30%, 50% or even more on the existing level. This is the fastest and most effective way to increase chemical products. The experience of the great leap forward last year proves that chemical production enterprises have huge potential. As long as we put politics in command, resolutely implement the mass line, give full play to the creativity of the masses, launch a mass movement centered on technological revolution, break outdated technical quotas, improve operating procedures, improve enterprise management, and reduce consumption quotas, we can boldly and confidently carry out technological innovations on some of the original, inefficient equipment, and greatly increase production without adding or adding little equipment. To achieve a great leap forward in chemical production, another important condition is to ensure the normal supply of raw materials and power required by chemical enterprises as much as possible, and to strengthen the cooperation between chemical enterprises and relevant departments. Therefore, the original reasonable cooperative relationships should continue to be maintained and consolidated, and new cooperative relationships must be established quickly.

    A large part of this year's chemical product production plan will also rely on new enterprises and new equipment that are under construction or will be built. Therefore, we should make every effort to speed up the pace of capital construction and strive for new enterprises to be put into production as soon as possible. For capital construction projects that have completed more than 80% or 90% of their plans last year, we should seize the final work, and give priority to ensuring the supply of construction forces, raw materials, and equipment, and strive for this part of the project to be put into production one after another in the first or second quarter. For important new and continued projects, we must, according to needs, in an orderly manner, with clear priorities, classify them, and launch concentrated attacks in batches. Based on the chemical industry foundation and the needs of all aspects, we should mainly focus on new construction projects for acids, alkalis, mines, pesticides, and medicines in the first half of the year, and focus on the organic synthesis industry and chemical fertilizers in the second half of the year. Taking into account the possible supply of materials and equipment, the arrangements in the same period should also be primary and secondary, with emphasis on what is important and what is light, and the primary and secondary should be appropriately matched to avoid simultaneous advancement and dispersed forces. The fundamental issue of speeding up the pace of construction is to carry out mass technological revolution movements in all capital construction units, promote advanced experience, and greatly shorten the construction period. The construction experience of the Lanzhou Chemical Plant last year proves that large chemical enterprises that used to take about two years to build can be shortened to about one year, which is entirely possible. Of course, to speed up the pace of construction, we must pay attention to ensuring quality, and earnestly achieve speed and quality. To speed up the progress of chemical construction, the main problem at present is to find ways to solve equipment and material problems. In addition to accelerating the manufacture of metal equipment, we must vigorously develop non-metallic materials and equipment. As long as it is not high-temperature, high-pressure, high-speed production, non-metallic materials and equipment should be widely used, and metal materials, equipment, and non-metallic materials and equipment should be carried out simultaneously. From the overall situation, this year's chemical industry construction scale is very large, the task is very heavy, and the characteristic is that there are more new products added. In order to ensure the realization of this year's capital construction plan and the smooth commissioning of new enterprises, chemical research and design departments must adapt to the requirements of the great leap forward in capital construction, accelerate research work and design progress, and strive to meet the needs of capital construction and production.

    In order to meet the needs of all aspects for chemical products, while actively developing the production of modern large enterprises and the leap forward in capital construction, it is also necessary to vigorously develop the "small-scale indigenous enterprises" and "small-scale modern enterprises" of the chemical industry to meet the needs of all aspects. "Small-scale indigenous enterprises" or "small-scale modern enterprises" can utilize various decentralized resources locally, can widely use non-metallic materials and equipment, the technology is relatively easy to master, the investment is small, the construction time is short, and the results are quick. It is suitable for universally mobilizing the masses to run. It can not only achieve more, faster, but also good and economical. From a technical point of view, chemical products such as sulfuric acid, soda ash, caustic soda, calcium carbide, synthetic ammonia, and butadiene-styrene rubber can all be produced by "small-scale indigenous enterprises" or "small-scale modern enterprises." To universally carry out "small-scale indigenous enterprises" or "small-scale modern enterprises" in the chemical industry, we must first do a good job in pilot projects, obtain mature experience in technology, ensure normal production, and on this basis, gradually increase the yield and reduce consumption quotas, so that the cost is basically the same as that of "large modern enterprises."

    In order to accelerate the development of the chemical industry, all departments that use a large number of chemical products or have chemical resources can arrange the production of chemical products, and this is also completely conditional. For example, the metallurgical industry uses smelting tail gas to produce sulfuric acid; recovers chemical products such as benzene, toluene, naphthalene, anthracene, and phenol from coking; the petroleum industry uses refinery waste gas to produce ethylene; synthetic ammonia is recovered from synthetic petroleum and coking, etc. Other industrial departments and transportation departments can also produce chemical products as needed. This not only facilitates their own needs, but also rationally utilizes resources.

    The task of achieving the great leap forward of the chemical industry in 1959 is very arduous, but it is also entirely achievable. The great leap forward in 1958 has laid the ideological and material foundation for achieving a greater leap forward this year. The current situation is favorable for the development of the chemical industry. We believe that as long as we adhere to liberating our minds, breaking superstitions, overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking, mustering all our energy, striving for excellence, implementing the mass line, combining the mass movement with centralized leadership, and combining the masses' soaring enthusiasm with meticulous organizational work, we will be able to mobilize the positive factors in all aspects, overcome the difficulties in the road ahead, and successfully complete and overfulfill the production and construction plans of the chemical industry in 1959.

    大大增加化工产品
    1959年我国国民经济全面的更大的跃进，要求化学工业也必须有一个更大的跃进，才能适应国民经济各部门生产建设发展的需要，适应科学技术的发展和人民生活日益增长的需要。
    化学工业是一个多行业、多品种、为国民经济各部门服务的生产部门。只就中央化学工业部所管的范围来说，就包括有十六个行业，一百一十六类，二万六千多个品种。化学工业是一个原料工业部门，它以上万种化工原料和制成品供应重工业、轻工业、农业、交通运输业和国防工业作为材料、原料和辅助原料，或直接用以装配机器机械，或直接供给人民生活需用。因此，它不仅同工农业生产有着不可分离的联系，而且同人民的衣、食、住、行，同文化、教育、体育、卫生等各方面也有着极为密切的联系。随着国民经济、科学技术的发展和人民生活的提高，各方面对化学工业产品的要求越来越多，越来越大。化学工业担负着为国家创造多种新的合成材料，促进国民经济的技术改造，加强国防实力，加速最新技术的发展，同时也为人民提供丰富多采的生活必需品的重大任务。
    化工产品，和工农业生产及人民生活有些什么联系呢？
    在重工业方面，冶金工业从开矿、选矿、冶炼到轧制成材，都需要许多种化工产品。开矿需要炸药，炼钢需要纯碱脱硫，轧钢需要硫酸去锈。有色金属和稀有金属需要多种化工产品作为选矿和提纯之用。运输和工矿企业的传动装置，也要使用大量的橡胶制品。金属加工工业、金属切割需用电石，焊接金属的电焊条需用多种化工产品作焊药原料。电机制造需用多种塑料作绝缘材料。机器、船舶、车辆、飞机需要大量油漆、塑料、橡胶制品。随着技术的发展，在机器制造业中，将越来越多地采用价廉而性能优良的塑料来代替金属材料。塑料在航空工业的应用，也越来越广泛，一架大型的喷气客机需用十二万个塑料制造的部件和零件。此外，电力、煤炭、石油、建筑、地质、森林等工业部门都需用不少化工产品。
    化学工业为轻工业服务的面更是十分广泛的，同日用消费品的关系极其密切。纺织工业需用纯碱、烧碱、硫、染料、洗涤剂、液氯、漂白粉等化工产品；造纸工业和食品工业都需要纯碱、烧碱、盐酸、硼砂、干冰等化工产品。我们只要到百货商店看一下，就可以发现，几乎很少能找到同化学工业没有关系的物品。味精、酱油的生产需用大量的盐酸；糖果需要香料和糖精；肥皂需要硬化油、烧碱、香料；牙膏需要碳酸镁、纯碱、烧碱、香料、硬脂酸；火柴需要氯酸钾和赤磷；琳琅满目的玻璃制品和搪瓷制品，没有纯碱、硼酸等化工原料就不能生产；金笔笔杆是塑料做的；手表的不碎“玻璃”是有机玻璃做的；漂亮的“玻璃”丝袜和人造丝绸，是化学纤维织成的；雨衣、台布、皮包、皮鞋也有许多是用塑料制成的。其他如奶嘴、热水瓶、电灯泡、干电池、墨水、油墨、照相胶卷、感光材料、自行车、乐器、收音机、照相机、唱片、汽水、饼干、香烟、玩具、钮扣、牙刷、梳子、西药、卫生用品等等，都少不了化工产品。如果化工产品不能保证它们的原材料，就要妨碍这些产品的生产，从而直接影响人民的日常生活。特别是医药产品，直接为人民健康服务，关系更大。由此可见，人民生活同化学工业发生了多么广泛而密切的联系。
    农业需要大量化肥和农药。交通运输需要大量橡胶制品。国防工业和尖端技术需要多种多样的新型的化工产品，需要高能燃料，需要耐高温、耐低温、高强度、高绝缘、耐腐蚀、耐磨擦、耐辐射的特种性能的合成材料。这些产品，对于我国国防工业和尖端技术的发展有极其重要的意义。这些产品，不仅具有许多天然材料和某些金属材料所没有的特性，而且有很大的经济意义，可以利用许多废弃原料来制造，生产成本较低。第二次世界大战以后，工业发达的国家都迅速地发展了有机合成工业。苏联在新的七年计划中，把发展化学工业作为重点，向这个工业部门投入最多的资金，也足以说明化学工业在社会主义建设中的重要地位和意义。
    解放以来，我国化学工业在党和政府的领导下，有了迅速的发展。特别是1958年，在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，在以钢为纲全面跃进的方针下，化学工业也有了很大的跃进。各种主要化工产品产量比1957年都有很大的增长。纯碱的产量比1957年增长了29％，烧碱增长了31％，硫酸增长了19％，合成氨增长了59％，硝铵增长了157％，化学肥料增长了34％，电石增长了44.6％，轮胎增长了97％，抗菌素增长了334％。这样的发展速度是以往任何一年所没有的。但是，其他重工业部门增长得更快，而农业的大丰收，又为轻工业的更大跃进准备了资源条件。因此，重工业和轻工业各部门对化工产品需要的增长大大超过了化工产品本身增长的速度。同时，随着工农业生产的大跃进，人民的购买力也增加了，人民生活各方面的需要都有了很大的增长。因此必须积极扩大化工产品的生产，以适应国民经济各方面的需要。
    国民经济各部门的大发展，要求化学工业必须来个更大的跃进，这是一方面。另一方面，化学工业具有多行业、多品种的特点，因此，它的内部也有着十分复杂的联系和一定的比例关系。因此在化学工业内部各个行业之间、原料工业同加工工业之间，大路货和小量产品、老产品和新产品、基本建设和生产、“大洋群”和“小土群”、一般和尖端等等，都必须按照适当的比例相应发展。在这种情况下，如何统筹兼顾、巧于安排就是一个十分重要的问题。今年的国家计划已经根据上述情况作了适当的安排，主要化工产品的产量比去年都将有极大的增长，今年的化工生产计划是个大跃进的计划。现在的问题是我们如何鼓足干劲，以十二分措施、二十四分干劲来保证实现这个计划。
    现有化工企业是化工生产的主要基地，完成今年的生产计划，主要的是依靠这些企业。因此必须在现有企业中组织生产大跃进，根据不同的情况，把产量在现有水平上分别提高20％、30％、50％甚至更多一点。这是增加化工产品最快最有效的途径。去年大跃进的经验证明，化工生产企业中蕴藏着巨大的潜力，只要政治挂帅，坚决贯彻群众路线，发挥群众的创造精神，开展以技术革命为中心的群众运动，打破过时的技术定额，改进操作规程，改善企业管理，降低消耗定额，对原有一些效能不高的设备进行大胆而又有把握的技术革新，就可以在不增加或者少增加设备的条件下，大大提高生产。实现化工生产的大跃进，还有一个重要条件，就是尽可能保证化工企业所需原料和动力的正常供应，加强化工企业同有关部门的协作。因此，原有的合理的协作关系应当继续保持和巩固，新的协作关系必须迅速建立。
    今年化工产品的生产计划中有很大一部分还要依靠正在建设或者将要建设的新企业和新设备来完成。因此，应当尽一切努力，加快基本建设速度，力争新建企业早日投入生产。对于去年已经完成计划80％、90％以上的基建工程，应抓紧进行扫尾工作，在施工力量、原材料和设备供应上，必须优先予以保证，力争这部分工程在第一季度或第二季度即可陆续投入生产。对于新建和续建的重要工程，必须根据需要，先后有序，主次分明，分类排队，分批突击。根据化学工业基础和各方面需要情况，上半年主要应该突击酸、碱、矿山、农药、医药等的新建工程，下半年抓有机合成工业和化学肥料。考虑到材料和设备的供应可能，在同一时期的安排上，也要主中有次，重中有轻，主次与轻重适当配合，避免齐头并进，分散力量。加快建设速度的根本问题，是在一切基本建设单位开展群众性的技术革命运动，推广先进经验，大大缩短工期。去年兰州化工厂的建设经验证明，过去需要两年左右才能建成的大型化工企业，缩短到一年左右建成也是完全可能的。当然加快建设速度，要注意必须保证质量，切实做到又快又好。要加快化工建设进度，当前的主要问题是千方百计解决设备和材料问题。除了加速金属设备的制造外，必须大搞非金属的材料、设备，只要不是高温、高压、高速的生产，都应该广泛采用非金属的材料和设备，实行金属材料、设备和非金属材料、设备并举。从总的情况看来，今年化学工业的建设规模很大，任务很重，特点又是新产品增加较多。为了保证今年基本建设计划的实现和新建企业顺利投入生产，化工研究和设计部门必须适应基本建设大跃进的要求，加速研究工作和设计的进度，力求满足基本建设和生产的需要。
    为了满足各方面对化工产品的需要，在积极发展现代化大企业的生产和基本建设跃进的同时，还必须大搞化学工业的“小土群”、“小洋群”，以满足各方面的需要。“小土群”或“小洋群”能够就地利用各种分散的资源，能够广泛利用非金属材料设备，技术比较容易掌握，投资少，建设时间短，收效快，适宜于普遍发动群众办。不仅能够达到多快的目的，同时也能好能省。从技术上看，硫酸、纯碱、烧碱、电石、合成氨、丁钠橡胶等化工产品，都可以搞“小土群”或“小洋群”。普遍开展“小土群”或“小洋群”化学工业，首先必须作好试点工作，在技术上取得成熟的经验，保证正常生产，并在这个基础上，逐步提高收率，降低消耗定额，作到成本基本上同“大洋群”差不多。
    为了加速化学工业的发展，凡是大量使用化工产品或者有化工资源的部门，都可以安排化工产品的生产，而且这样作也是完全有条件的。例如，冶金工业利用冶炼尾气生产硫酸；炼焦中回收苯、甲苯、萘、葸、酚等化工产品；石油工业利用炼油废气生产乙烯；人造石油和炼焦回收合成氨等等。其他工业部门和交通运输部门也可以根据需要生产化工产品。这样作既便利本身的需要，又可以合理地利用资源。
    实现1959年化学工业大跃进的任务是十分艰巨的，但也是完全有条件实现的。1958年的大跃进，已经为实现今年更大的跃进奠定了思想的和物质的基础，当前的形势对于发展化学工业是有利的。我们相信，只要坚持解放思想，破除迷信，克服右倾保守思想，鼓足干劲，力争上游，贯彻群众路线，使大搞群众运动和集中领导相结合，使群众的冲天干劲和细致的组织工作结合起来，就能够动员各方面的积极因素，克服前进道路中的困难，胜利地完成和超额完成1959年化学工业的生产和建设计划。
