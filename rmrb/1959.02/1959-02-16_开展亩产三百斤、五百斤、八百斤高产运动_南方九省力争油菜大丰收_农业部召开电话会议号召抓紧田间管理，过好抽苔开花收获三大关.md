Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: The rapeseed-producing provinces across the country are enthusiastically launching a rapeseed bumper harvest movement, boosting even greater and fuller efforts to grasp the three key stages of rapeseed bolting, flowering, and harvesting, striving to fire the first shot of oil crops this year and pass the oil crop threshold. This was proposed by the Ministry of Agriculture at a telephone conference on rapeseed field management in nine southern provinces held on the 13th.

The conference was attended by the directors of agriculture departments and bureaus from nine major rapeseed-producing provinces, including Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Yunnan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Guizhou. They reported on the rapeseed sowing situation and current field management. The quality of rapeseed sowing this year is better than any previous year: plowing is deeper, generally six to eight inches deep, an increase of two to three inches compared to previous years; base fertilizer is abundant, generally 20,000 to 30,000 jin per mu, an increase of one to two times compared to previous years; seeds are good, with most areas planting local improved varieties, and the area of the famous "Victory Rapeseed" improved variety has doubled compared to last year; in the past, direct sowing was the norm, but this year, seedling transplanting has been vigorously promoted.

Judging from the reports, under the attention and leadership of local Party committees, this year's field management of rapeseed crops has also been greatly strengthened. The biggest feature of rapeseed field management this year is that it started earlier and was grasped more tightly than in previous years. Currently, most rapeseed fields in various regions have undergone one round of inter-tillage weeding, soil cultivation, and topdressing, and some have even completed two to three rounds of inter-tillage weeding, soil cultivation, and topdressing. In Sichuan Province, more than 90% of the 6.3 million mu of rapeseed fields have been topdressed once, more than half have been topdressed twice, and more than 10% have been topdressed three times. Rapeseed in Sichuan, Yunnan, Hubei, and other provinces has experienced varying degrees of rapeseed aphid and rapeseed sawfly pest damage. Various regions have actively carried out prevention and control measures by combining local and foreign pesticides and machinery, and some have achieved initial results. Due to the higher winter temperatures compared to previous years, rapeseed in Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces generally shows signs of early bolting and flowering. Currently, the masses in these areas are pinching buds, picking flowers, and applying more topdressing to encourage more branching and pod formation in rapeseed. After these measures, the growth of rapeseed in various regions is good, the plants are vigorous, the leaves are abundant, and the leaves are a blue-green color.

At the meeting, the directors of agriculture departments and bureaus also expressed their intention to tightly grasp the late-stage management of rapeseed fields and strive for a bumper rapeseed harvest. Sichuan Province plans to apply another topdressing of bolting fertilizer and a topdressing of flowering fertilizer per mu before the rapeseed harvest. Yunnan Province is determined to eliminate third-class seedlings during the seedling stage. Hubei Province is determined to vigorously grasp late-stage field management, especially applying spring fertilizer and flowering fertilizer, and strive for large-scale high yields of rapeseed. Hunan Province has decided to launch a concentrated effort to apply three spring fertilizers, striving to achieve rapeseed yields of 300 jin, 500 jin respectively per mu. Zhejiang Province is determined to grasp the key aspects of bolting, flowering topdressing, drainage, and pest and disease control, and fire the first shot of a bumper rapeseed harvest.

Gu Dachuan, Vice Minister of Agriculture, concluded the meeting by saying: Oil production occupies a very important position in the entire agricultural production. Therefore, this year, we must boost even greater efforts to grasp the three key stages of rapeseed bolting, flowering, and harvesting, strive to overfulfill the state-prescribed rapeseed production task, fire the first shot of oil crops, drive other oil crops forward together for a greater leap forward, and strive to pass the oil crop threshold this year. The quality of rapeseed sowing this year is better than any previous year, with deeper plowing, more fertilizer application, denser planting, and earlier and tighter field management. Therefore, the seedlings are growing well. This is a more favorable condition for striving for a bumper rapeseed harvest than in any previous year.

Gu Dachuan said: In order to strive to fire the first shot of oil crops, each province can launch a high-yield movement of 300 jin, 500 jin, 800 jin, or even higher per mu of rapeseed, according to the different situations and conditions of different special zones, counties, and communes (Editor's note: last year, the national average yield per mu was 73 jin), boost even greater efforts, add more field management measures, and strive for a bumper rapeseed harvest. The current key is to do a good job in field management centered on topdressing, ensuring that rapeseed is well-fed and warm during the bolting and flowering periods, applying 10,000 jin of farm manure per mu, eliminating third-class seedlings during the seedling stage, and upgrading second-class seedlings to first-class seedlings. For rapeseed that is bolting and flowering early, we must quickly pinch buds, pick flowers, and apply fertilizer. The weather is warm this year, with little snow and rain, and rapeseed in various regions is experiencing pests and diseases. Various regions must prepare local pesticides and machinery, and eliminate pests and diseases as soon as they are discovered to prevent them from spreading and causing harm. At the same time, pay attention to preventing frost damage and prepare for frost prevention. There is more rainfall in the south in February and March, and these areas should do a good job in cleaning ditches and furrows for drainage and flood prevention.

Gu Dachuan said: Doing the above work can strive for a leap forward in rapeseed yield per unit area. However, to strive for a bumper rapeseed harvest this year, we must also ensure the sown area, basically achieving "planting one mu and harvesting one mu," and not turning over rapeseed that is not growing well as green manure. Various regions must calculate this account: if rapeseed has a bumper harvest, not only will the oil problem be increased, but also the rapeseed cake will be increased. This year, the national rapeseed sown area has expanded by about 10 million mu compared to last year, but the area in some provinces has decreased. Such provinces should try to expand the sown area of peanuts, sesame, soybeans, etc., in the spring and summer sowing to compensate for the insufficient rapeseed sown area. Gu Dachuan said that if the unit area yield of oil crops across the country is improved and a certain sown area is guaranteed, the oil threshold can be crossed. (Attached pictures)

    开展亩产三百斤、五百斤、八百斤高产运动
    南方九省力争油菜大丰收
    农业部召开电话会议号召抓紧田间管理，过好抽苔开花收获三大关
    新华社15日讯　全国产油菜的省份热烈地开展一个油菜丰产运动，鼓起更大、更足的干劲，抓好油菜抽苔、开花、收获三大关，力争今年打响油料作物的第一炮，过油料关。这是农业部在13日召开的南方九省油菜田间管理电话会议上提出来的。
    参加这次会议的有全国主要产油菜的湖北、湖南、四川、云南、安徽、江苏、浙江、江西和贵州等九省的农业厅、局长。他们在会上汇报了油菜播种情况和当前田间管理的情况。今年油菜播种的质量比以往任何一年都好：耕得深，一般都深耕六寸到八寸，比往年增深二寸到三寸；底肥多，一般每亩施肥两万到三万斤，比往年增加一倍到两倍；种籽好，大部分地区种植了地方良种，著名的“胜利油菜”良种面积，比去年扩大一倍左右；过去是习惯直播，今年大力推广了育苗移栽。
    从汇报的情况看，在各地党委的重视和领导下，今年油菜作物的田间管理工作也大大加强了。今年油菜田间管理的最大特点是，比往年动手早，抓得紧。目前大部分地区的油菜田，都进行了一次中耕除草、培土和追肥，有的还作到两次到三次的中耕除草、培土和追肥。四川省六百三十万亩油菜田，90％以上追过一次肥，一半以上追过两次肥，10％以上追肥三次。四川、云南、湖北等省油菜，都曾发生不同程度的油菜蚜虫和油菜叶蜂虫害，各地及时采取土洋农药械并举的办法积极防治，有的已收到初步的成效。由于冬季气温比往年高，湖南、湖北等省的油菜，普遍有早抽苔、开花的现象，目前这些地区的群众正在打苔、摘花，多施追肥，让油菜多分枝，多结荚。经过这些措施后，现在各地油菜的生长情况良好，植株旺，叶片多，叶子发出青绿色。
    会上，各地农业厅局长还表示要紧紧抓住油菜田的后期管理，力争油菜大丰收。四川省打算在油菜收获前，每亩再追一次抽苔肥，一次开花肥。云南省决心把三类苗消灭在苗期。湖北省决心大抓后期田间管理，特别是追施迎春肥、花期肥，力争油菜大面积丰产。湖南省决定突击抓三次迎春肥，争取油菜亩产分别达到三百、五百斤。浙江省决心抓好抽苔、开花追肥、排水、防治病虫害等关键，打响油菜丰收的炮。
    农业部副部长顾大川最后在会上讲话说：油料生产在整个农业生产上占很重要的地位。因此，今年必须鼓足更大的干劲，抓好油菜抽苔、开花、收获三大关，争取超额完成国家规定的油菜生产任务，打响油料作物的第一炮，把其他油料作物带动起来，一齐向前更大的跃进，力争今年过油料大关。今年油菜播种质量比以往任何一年都好，耕得深，施肥多，种得密，田间管理又抓得早，抓得紧，因此，苗子生长得好。这是争取油菜丰收比过去任何一年都为有利的条件。
    顾大川说：为了争取打响油料作物的第一炮，各省可以根据专区、各县、各社的不同情况，不同条件，分别开展一个油菜亩产三百斤、五百斤、八百斤或者更高一点的丰产运动（编者按：去年全国平均亩产七十三斤），鼓起更大的干劲，对田间管理的措施加码，力争油菜大丰收。目前的关键是要做好以追施肥料为中心的田间管理工作，在抽苔、开花期让油菜吃饱盖暖，每亩追施农家肥一万斤，把三类苗消灭在苗期，把二类苗提高到一类苗，对早抽苔、开花的油菜要抓紧打苔、摘花和追施肥料。今年天气暖，雪雨少，各地油菜都有病虫害发生，各地要作好土农药械的准备工作，随时发现病虫害，随时消灭，使它不蔓延为害。同时，注意防止冻害的袭击，作好防冻准备工作。南方2、3月份雨水较多，这些地区要做好清理沟畦的工作，以便排水防涝。
    顾大川说：做好以上的工作，可以争取油菜单位面积跃进增产。但要争取今年油菜丰收，还要保证播种面积，作到基本上“种一亩收一亩”，不要把生长不好的油菜作绿肥翻掉了。各地要算这笔账：油菜丰收了，不仅油的问题有增产，油菜子饼也会增产。今年全国油菜播种面积比去年扩大了约一千万亩，但是有的省面积却减少了。这样的省份，要在春播和夏播中设法扩大花生、芝麻、大豆等的播种面积，以弥补油菜播种面积的不足。顾大川说，如果全国油料作物的单位面积产量提高了，又保证了一定的播种面积，油料的关就可以过去。（附图片）
