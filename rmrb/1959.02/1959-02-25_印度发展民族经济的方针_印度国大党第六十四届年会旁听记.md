India's Policy for Developing the National Economy
    ——Notes on Attending the 64th Annual Meeting of the Indian National Congress
    By Gao Liang, Our Correspondent

    The Indian National Congress held its 64th annual meeting in Nagpur from January 9th to 11th this year, defining the path and policies for India's national economic development.

    More than two thousand INC delegates attended the meeting. The report made to the conference by the General Secretary of the INC explained the economic background against which the meeting was convened.

    After India's independence, the national economy achieved a certain degree of development. During the First Five-Year Plan, food production increased by 17.5%; the state-capitalist public sector in industry was initially established; and foreign trade also came under state management. In 1956, the government formulated the Second Five-Year Plan, with the main goal of developing heavy industry and prioritizing state investment in areas such as steel, electricity, and transportation. A memorandum on planning issues issued by the INC's "Socialist Forum" at this annual meeting described the development of the public sector under the national plan. During the First and Second Five-Year Plans, investment in the public sector in the manufacturing industry alone increased more than sixteen-fold, while the private sector increased by 2.25 times. However, in terms of the total national industrial production investment, the public sector accounted for only 8%, with the remainder belonging to the private sector. Private capital still played a major role in the national economy. In recent years, monopoly capital in the private sector has adopted a mode of cooperation with foreign capital, demanding greater profits and expanding into various sectors. They jointly opposed the government's continued expansion of the public sector and opposed increasing taxes on them. To obtain foreign capital, monopoly capital did not hesitate to ask the government to accept the attached conditions of foreign aid.

    Now, the Second Five-Year Plan is about to enter its fourth year. In the past two years or more, in addition to the opposition from private monopoly capital, the public sector has also encountered difficulties in lacking construction funds due to the insufficient development of domestic sources of funds, resulting in a greater demand for foreign aid. The "Socialist Forum" memorandum mentioned that during the First Five-Year Plan, foreign aid accounted for only 10% of the total planned investment, while it accounted for 32% during the Second Five-Year Plan. Since the beginning of 1958, the economic crisis in the capitalist world has affected India's exports, with the prices of some exported raw materials falling by 18% to 20%, while the import prices of industrial raw materials needed by India have continued to rise. As a result, foreign trade has experienced a deficit, and foreign exchange is extremely strained. The total investment for the Second Five-Year Plan was originally set at 48 billion rupees (approximately 24 billion RMB), but due to rising import prices, production targets have actually been reduced. Last year, the investment amount had to be reduced to 45 billion rupees. The speed of industrial production is also declining. The INC General Secretary's report pointed out that the production growth rate was 8.1% in 1955, but only 3.5% in 1957-1958.

    According to official announcements, foreign aid of 6.4 billion rupees is still needed in the next two years of the plan. The World Bank, controlled by the United States, had promised to provide assistance to India. It held a meeting in Delhi last October, but after the meeting, Western finance ministers expressed their demand that the Indian government pave the way for the free investment of foreign private capital. The World Bank sent a delegation to India for inspection before the meeting and submitted a report, suggesting that the Indian government concentrate on developing agriculture and interrupt the current construction, entering a "period of consolidation and stagnation." In recent years, only socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Romania have provided sincere, selfless, and preferential loans and technical assistance to India's public sector industries such as steel, heavy machinery, oil refining, and resource exploration.

    The INC General Secretary's report pointed out that India's food production has increased to a certain extent during the Second Five-Year Plan, but it has not reached the planned target, so it is still necessary to import food from abroad every year. Due to the constraints of the feudal system on productivity, as well as last year's natural disasters and lack of water conservancy, the food production in 1957-1958, according to this report, is estimated to have decreased from 68.7 million tons in 1956-1957 to 62 million tons. Because of the food shortage, the country has to import 3 million tons of grain from abroad. This not only affects the country's self-reliance but also consumes a large amount of foreign exchange. In order to make up for the shortage of foreign exchange, the country has had to reduce the import of machinery and equipment, delaying the progress of construction.

    After India's independence, the Zamindari system established by the British has been abolished, and the deeply rooted feudal forces have been weakened. However, the large landowners and various intermediate exploiters that existed under the Zamindari system still exist. Individual provinces have stipulated the maximum limit for land ownership, but due to the long delay, large landowners have dispersed and transferred land through various means, and many landlords have become capitalist landlords. Evictions are common, and the number of landless peasants is gradually increasing. For many years, the masses in various places have demanded the implementation of more thorough land reforms. Labor and Employment Minister Nanda published an article in the INC's "Economic Review" last year, talking about the widespread evictions in rural areas and the necessity of stipulating a maximum limit on land ownership.

    The 64th annual meeting of the INC was convened under these circumstances. The key issues facing the meeting were: whether national construction should be based on self-reliance or rely more on foreign aid; whether to prioritize the development of the public sector and heavy industry, or prioritize the development of the private sector and abandon heavy industry; whether to implement a more thorough land reform policy in agriculture to increase agricultural production, or maintain the original feudal land system and develop agricultural capitalism on this basis. The results of the meeting showed that the desire to develop a national independent economy within the Indian National Congress overcame numerous difficulties and opposition, and was affirmed at the annual meeting.

      ×　　×　　×　　×

    In the period leading up to the 64th annual meeting, some big bourgeois newspapers in Delhi opposed the government's policy of planned economic development, shouting that "democracy is threatened." M. R. Masani, head of the "Free Enterprise Forum" associated with the Tata Group, repeatedly demanded that the government "adjust the Five-Year Plan" and "let the people breathe a sigh of relief." Some grain merchants also opposed the government's grain nationalization plan. Nehru stated at the meeting that the state is now determined to develop the state-owned sector; the private sector does not hinder the development of the state-owned sector, and is beneficial to the private sector itself. On January 3rd this year, Nehru pointed out at a press conference held in Delhi that "wherever the public sector can solve problems economically and beneficially," it will be given priority. In areas designated for development by the private sector, the government has no intention of hindering it or constantly restraining it. "However, if the private sector attempts to overtake the public sector somewhere, and thus missteps, then it should not complain if someone steps on its foot."

    These differing opinions on economic policy were also reflected in the discussions at the annual meeting. In the two-day heated debate of the subject committee, Babubhai Chinai, former chairman of the All-India Manufacturers' Organization, vehemently opposed the development of the public sector and the national grain policy. Some people, led by Charan Singh, Minister of Revenue of Uttar Pradesh, tried their best to oppose land reform and cooperative farming. They believed that doing so would be "forced" and "undemocratic," and would cause "political dissatisfaction" among farmers. They advocated the development of capitalist large farms. However, many people at the meeting also proposed that the maximum limit of land ownership should be stipulated as soon as possible, and the remaining land should be directly distributed to landless farmers, and should not be distributed to the village self-government units dominated by landlords and rich peasants. With Nehru's support, the meeting passed two resolutions on the Five-Year Plan and "forms of agricultural organization." The meeting also adopted a resolution on foreign policy based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    The "Forms of Agricultural Organization" resolution stipulated for the first time that the future form of agricultural organization in India would be collective farming cooperatives in which farmers retain land ownership. In order to achieve this goal, the resolution stipulates that each province must formulate legislation on the maximum limit of land ownership by the end of this year at the latest. The level of the limit will be determined by each province. Land exceeding the maximum limit will be handed over to the village council, which will organize landless farmers to form cooperatives. The resolution did not mention when the land distribution work would be completed. For farmers of other components, service cooperatives such as supply and marketing credit will be established nationwide within three years to absorb their participation.

    The resolution on the Five-Year Plan determined a seven-point plan focused on developing internal resources, including operating state-owned enterprises to obtain more funds for the development of the national economy, controlling private profits, and saving expenses. The resolution believes that foreign loans can be accepted without any political or economic conditions attached. In his speech, Nehru rejected the argument put forward by the World Bank that India should have a "consolidation" period before rapidly developing its economy.

    Meeting participants also talked about the Third Five-Year Plan. Many representatives talked about the increasing population and the growing unemployment situation. In order to solve these problems, one opinion emphasized simply developing small-scale industries. In its memorandum on the Third Five-Year Plan, the "Socialist Forum" put forward the idea of ​​equal emphasis on industry and agriculture and striving to develop domestic resources. Nehru supported the implementation of national industrialization, the establishment of an industrial and agricultural country, emphasizing the development of heavy industry, and implementing a policy of combining large, medium, and small industries in India.

    The meeting proposed in the resolution on the Five-Year Plan to establish a "democratic socialist society" in India. According to Nehru's many speeches and the views of the "Socialist Forum" that supported him, the content of the "democratic socialist society" is mainly: to develop national and private capital industries under the principle of equal opportunities; to establish a "cooperative" agricultural economy nationwide through "democratic" methods, but to retain private land ownership; and to gradually reduce the gap in income between various classes in terms of distribution.

    The resolutions of the annual meeting reflect the desire to develop the national economy, and are therefore welcomed by the people. The All-India Trade Union Congress, which has 1.45 million members, has passed a resolution at its recently held council meeting to support the policies of the INC annual meeting regarding the development of the public sector and the national grain policy, because this is of positive significance for promoting production and social progress.

    In a recent article published in the "New Age Weekly," Indian Communist Party General Secretary Ajoy Ghosh, on the one hand, pointed out the vague and unspecific aspects of the resolution, such as the resolution not stipulating the time limit for the implementation of land distribution after the enactment of legislation on the maximum limit of land ownership, the maximum limit should be how much is not clearly stipulated, the land is not directly distributed to landless farmers, but handed over to the village council, and no specific measures have been set out for controlling the profits of private capital, etc.; but on the other hand, he expressed his support for Prime Minister Nehru and many representatives' determination to develop the public sector. He believes that the progressive forces within the INC "must fight not only for certain principles, but also for specific policies and specific measures that can realize these principles" in alliance with all democratic parties and forces outside the party. He said: "Such a possibility is increasing, and all true democratic forces in the country must make every effort to make this possibility a reality."

    However, some powerful groups and feudal forces in the Indian bourgeoisie are trying their best to oppose these resolutions. The bourgeois newspaper "Indian Express" said that the resolutions of this meeting were "boring." The Birla Group's newspaper "Hindustan Times" criticized the government for being "autocratic" towards private enterprises in its comments on the meeting. The "People's League" and "Hindu Mahasabha," parties representing feudal landlords, have also recently issued statements strongly opposing the resolution to establish agricultural cooperative organizations.

    INC leaders and progressive forces are preparing to implement the resolutions of this annual meeting. Many INC members believe that it will take a relatively long process to move from resolution to implementation, and many problems and difficulties will arise. Currently, some provinces have begun to discuss measures to stipulate the maximum limit of land ownership. Thousands of INC leaders and responsible persons at all levels are "hiking," traveling from village to village, publicizing the resolutions of the meeting, and mobilizing farmers to actively produce.

    印度发展民族经济的方针
    ——印度国大党第六十四届年会旁听记
    本报记者　高梁
    今年1月9日到11日，国大党在那格浦尔举行第六十四届年会，规定了印度发展民族经济的道路和方针。
    两千多名国大党代表出席了这次会议。国大党总书记向大会所作的报告，说明了这届会议召开的经济背景。
    印度独立后，民族经济获得一定的发展。第一个五年计划期间，粮食增产17.5％；在工业中新的国家资本主义性质的公营部分初步建立起来了；对外贸易也归国家管理。1956年，政府制定了第二个五年计划，主要目标是发展重工业，把国家的投资重点安排在钢铁、电力、交通等方面。国大党“社会主义论坛”在这次年会上发出的关于计划问题的备忘录，说明了公营部分在国家计划下发展的情况。在第一个和第二个五年计划期间，公营部分仅在制造工业方面的投资就增加了十六倍多，私营部分增加了二点二五倍。但就全国工业生产投资总额来说，公营部分只占8％，其余均属私营部分。私人资本在国民经济生活中仍起主要的作用。几年来，私营部分中的垄断资本采取了与外资合作的方式，要求更多的利润，向各个部门扩展。他们共同反对政府继续扩大公营部分，反对对他们增加税收。为了取得外资，垄断资本不惜要求政府接受外援的附带条件。
    现在，第二个五年计划即将进入第四个年头。过去两年多，除了来自私人垄断资本的反对外，公营部分还遇到由于未充分开拓国内资金来源而产生的缺少建设资金的困难，因此对外援有更多的要求。“社会主义论坛”的备忘录提到，第一个五年计划期间，外援仅占计划总投资的10％，在第二个五年计划期间它却占32％。自1958年初，资本主义世界的经济危机影响了印度的出口，有些出口原料价格下降18％到20％，而印度需要的工业原料的进口价格却不断上涨。因此对外贸易发生逆差，外汇极为困难。第二个五年计划总投资原来规定为四百八十亿卢比（约合人民币二百四十亿元），由于进口价格上涨，生产指标实际上已有所削减，去年又不得不在投资数额上削减为四百五十亿卢比。工业生产的速度也在下降，国大党总书记的报告指出，1955年生产增长速度为8.1％，1957—1958年仅为3.5％。
    据官方公布，计划后两年仍需外援六十四亿卢比。由美国控制的世界银行曾答应给印度以援助。去年10月它曾在德里开会，但会后西方国家财政部长们却表示要求印度政府为外国私人资本的投资自由铺平道路。世界银行在会议前曾派代表团在印度考察，提出了报告，建议印度政府集中发展农业，中断当前建设，来个“巩固和停止发展的时期”。几年来，只有社会主义国家苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚等对印度工业的公营部分如钢铁、重型机械、炼油、资源勘探等方面给了认真无私、条件优越的贷款和技术帮助。
    国大党总书记的报告指出，在第二个五年计划期间，印度粮食生产有一定增加，但它没有达到计划预期的指标，因而每年还必须从国外输入粮食。由于封建制度对生产力的束缚，以及去年的自然灾害和水利的缺乏，1957—1958年的粮食生产，据此报告估计，从1956—1957年的六千八百七十万吨下降为六千二百万吨。因为缺粮，国家要从外国输入粮食三百万吨。这不仅影响国家的自力更生，而且消耗大量外汇。为了弥补外汇的不足，国家不得不减少机器装备的输入，推迟了建设的进度。
    印度独立后，英国建立的包税地主制已经废除，根深蒂固的封建势力有了削弱，然而过去在包税地主制下存在的大土地拥有者以及各种各样的中间剥削人却仍然存在着。个别省邦规定了土地占有的最高限额，但由于时间拖长，大土地所有者已通过各种方式将土地分散和转移，不少地主也变成了资本主义经营的地主。退佃普遍发生，无地农民逐渐加多。多年来，各地群众要求实行比较彻底的土地改革，劳动就业计划部长南达曾在去年的国大党“经济评论”上发表文章，谈到农村大批退佃和规定占有土地最高限额的必要。
    国大党六十四届年会是在这种情况下召开的。会议面临的关键问题是：国家建设是以自力更生为主，还是更多地依靠外援；是优先发展公营部分和重工业，还是优先发展私营部分，放弃重工业；在农业方面实行比较彻底的土地改革政策以提高农业生产，还是保持原有封建土地制度，并在此基础上发展农业资本主义。会议的结果表明，印度国大党内发展民族独立经济的愿望克服了重重的困难和反对，而在年会中被肯定。
      ×　　×　　×　　×
    在六十四届年会的前一个时期，德里的一些大资产阶级报纸纷纷反对政府有计划发展经济的政策，发出“民主遭到威胁”的叫嚷。与塔塔财团有联系的“自由企业论坛”负责人马萨尼曾不止一次地要求政府“调整五年计划”，“使人民松一口气”。一些粮食商人也反对政府的粮食国营计划。尼赫鲁在这次会上表示，国家现在决心发展国营部分；私营部分不妨碍国营部分的发展，对于私营部分本身是有利的。今年1月3日，尼赫鲁在德里举行的一次记者招待会上曾指出，在“公营部分能够既经济又有利地解决问题的一切地方”，它都将得到优先的地位。在规定由私营部分发展的地方，政府无意妨碍它或者随时勒住它。“但是，要是在什么地方私营部分企图赶过公营部分，因而伸错了脚，那么，如果有谁踩到它的脚上，它也不应该抱怨。”
    这些有关经济政策方面的不同意见，也反映在年会会议的讨论中。在议题委员会的两天激烈辩论中，前届全印工商联合会主席巴布拜·秦纳激烈反对发展公营部分和粮食国营政策。以北方邦税收部长恰兰·辛格为首的一些人，竭力反对土地改革和合作耕种制。他们认为，这样作将会是“强迫的”，“不民主的”，农民会产生“政治上的不满”。他们主张发展资本主义的大农场。但是会上也有不少人提出，要尽快规定土地占有最高限额，剩余的土地应直接分给无地农民，不应分给由地主富农掌握的乡村自治单位乡评议会。会议在尼赫鲁的支持下，通过了有关五年计划和“农业组织形式”两个决议。会议还通过以和平共处五项原则为基础的外交政策的决议。
    “农业组织形式”的决议第一次规定，未来印度的农业组织形式是农民保留有土地所有权的集体耕作的合作社。为了实行这个目标，决议规定各省邦至迟须在今年年底前制定关于占有土地最高限额的立法，限额高低由各省自定，超过最高限额的土地交给乡评议会，并由它组织无地的农民组成合作社。决议没有提到什么时候完成土地分配工作。对于其他成分的农民，将在三年内在全国建立起供销信贷等性质的服务合作社，吸收他们参加。
    有关五年计划的决议，确定以开辟内部资源为主的七点计划，其中包括经营国营企业为发展国家经济取得更多的资金、控制私人利润、节省开支等。决议认为，可以在不附有任何政治经济条件的情况下接受外国贷款。尼赫鲁在讲话中拒绝了像世界银行提出的要印度在迅速发展经济之前有个“巩固”时期的论调。
    会议参加者也谈到第三个五年计划。许多代表谈到人口增加和失业情况日渐增长的问题。为了解决这些问题，有一种意见强调单纯发展小工业。“社会主义论坛”在有关第三个五年计划的备忘录中提出了工农业并重、努力开辟国内资源的意见。尼赫鲁支持实行国家工业化，建立工业农业国家，强调发展重工业，并在印度实行大、中、小型工业结合的方针。
    会议在五年计划的决议中提出，在印度建立一个“民主社会主义社会”。根据尼赫鲁的多次发言和支持他的“社会主义论坛”的观点，
  “民主社会主义社会”的内容主要是：在机会平等的原则下发展国家和私人资本的工业；通过“民主”方法，在全国建立起“合作化”的农业经济，但保留土地私有制；在分配方面逐渐减少各个阶层收入的差距。
    年会的决议反映了发展民族经济的愿望，因此受到人们的欢迎。具有一百四十五万会员的全印工会大会已在最近召开的理事会上通过决议，支持国大党年会决议中有关发展公营部分及粮食国营的政策，因为这对促进生产和社会进步是有积极意义的。
    印度共产党总书记高士在最近一期“新世纪周刊”发表的一篇文章中，一方面指出决议中笼统不具体的地方，如决议未规定在占有土地最高限额立法后实行土地分配的期限，最高限额应该是多少规定得不明确，土地不是直接分给无地农民，而是交给乡评议会，在控制私人资本利润方面未定出具体办法等等；但另方面，他表示支持尼赫鲁总理及许多代表对发展公营部分的决心。他认为国大党内进步力量
  “不仅必须为某些原则，而且必须为一些能够实现这些原则的具体政策和具体措施”而同党外一切民主党派和力量联合斗争。他说：“这样的可能性已在增加，全国一切真正的民主力量必须尽一切努力使这种可能性变为现实。”
    但是，印度资产阶级中的某些有势力集团及封建势力竭力反对这些决议。资产阶级报纸“印度快报”说，这次会议的决议是“无聊”的。比尔拉财团的报纸“印度斯坦时报”在评论这次会议时，指责政府对私营企业“专制”。代表封建地主的政党“人民同盟”和“印度教大会”最近也发表声明，强烈地反对建立农业合作组织的决议。
    国大党领导者和进步力量正在准备实现这次年会的决议。许多国大党人士认为，由决议到实现，还要经过一个较长的过程，还会出现许多问题和困难。目前，有些省邦已在开始讨论规定占有土地最高限额的措施。成千的国大党各级领导者和负责人正在“徒步旅行”，他们从村庄到村庄，宣传会议的决议，动员农民积极生产。
