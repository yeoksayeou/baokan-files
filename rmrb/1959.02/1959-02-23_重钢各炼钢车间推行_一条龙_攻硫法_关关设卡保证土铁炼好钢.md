Chongqing, February 22nd (Reported by this newspaper) Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has conscientiously summarized the experience of fighting against high-sulfur local iron over the past few months. Recently, it has also changed the cold air in the pig iron furnace to hot air, increasing the desulfurization rate from the original 20%-30% to 50%-70%, creating better conditions for further shortening smelting time and improving steel production and quality.

Since the fourth quarter of last year, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has begun to use a mixture of local iron and imported iron to make steel. Since January of this year, local iron has accounted for a large proportion. Although these local iron ores have maintained good quality, the sulfur content is still quite high, and the sulfur ratio of local iron from different regions varies, making desulfurization difficult to control. From the beginning of using local iron, the Party Committee of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company mobilized the masses to fight against high sulfur. They mobilized the masses to discuss whether local iron could be used to make good steel and how to use local iron to make good steel, so that the majority of workers deeply understood the important significance of technically solving the problem of making good steel from local iron for accelerating the development of the steel industry.

In the process of fighting against high sulfur, the workers continuously experimented and summarized their experiences, and gradually mastered a relatively complete set of methods. This is the "one-dragon" desulfurization method that people call it: four barriers are set up from the raw materials entering the factory to the molten steel leaving the furnace, and different methods are adopted to fight against high sulfur, so as not to let it slip through. They set up the first barrier in the raw material management process, strengthened the testing of local iron, classified and stacked local iron with different components, and marked them, so that the smelting department could see at a glance, have a clear understanding of the nature of the raw materials, and facilitate the adoption of different smelting measures. Then, a second barrier was set up on the pig iron furnace, including in-furnace desulfurization, trough desulfurization, and molten iron ladle desulfurization, so that the desulfurization efficiency reached a maximum of 70% and averaged 53.6%. After the No. 2 pig iron furnace was changed from acidic to alkaline pig iron furnace, it created the highest record of alkaline pig iron furnace lifespan of sixteen hours in four days. The third barrier is desulfurization in the open hearth furnace. They adopted measures such as good slag making (more slag, fast slag discharge, early initial slag discharge), good temperature, good thermal control, and good high-temperature operation in the smelting operation. The desulfurization effect is very significant, and 50% can be removed in the furnace, up to 70%. The fourth barrier is desulfurization outside the open hearth furnace, that is, adding mixed desulfurizer (i.e., soda, limestone, marble) to the holding barrel when tapping steel, strengthening stirring and strengthening cooperation and coordination. The desulfurization effect can generally reach about 20%. As a result, sulfur has nowhere to escape, and a great victory has been achieved in the fight against sulfur. The large open hearth furnace once created a new smelting record of smelting a furnace of steel from local iron in five minutes and fifty-eight seconds. The quality is generally qualified, and high-quality steel has been produced.

Recently, the workers of the small open hearth furnace workshop and the converter plant pig iron furnace of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company have realized a major technical innovation of changing the cold air in the pig iron furnace to hot air, which has further improved the desulfurization effect. Originally, the air blown into the pig iron furnace was cold air. Because the local iron contained less heating elements such as manganese and silicon, the addition of cold air would not increase the temperature of the molten iron, only about 1250 to 1300 degrees Celsius. In this case, not much desulfurizer can be added to the molten iron (adding more will further reduce the temperature, and sometimes even freeze it. Therefore, cold air is a major key affecting desulfurization. At the beginning of this year, the workers of the small open hearth furnace and converter seized this key and strived to change the cold air to hot air in order to increase the temperature of the molten iron. In the process of reconstruction, there were no ready-made drawings, so they boldly created and designed and drew their own drawings; if there were no materials, they looked for waste materials to manufacture themselves. After several days of hard work, a hot blast stove was finally built. From then on, the air blown into the pig iron furnace first passed through the hot blast stove, became hot air, and then entered the pig iron furnace. After this hot blast pig iron furnace was put into production on January 29, the temperature of the molten iron increased from an average of 1252 degrees in the past to 1370 degrees to 1400 degrees. Adding 1% desulfurizer can desulfurize 50% to 70%, shortening the average smelting time by 1.29 minutes, which has a great effect on improving steel production and quality.

    重钢各炼钢车间推行“一条龙”攻硫法
    关关设卡保证土铁炼好钢
    本报重庆22日电　重庆钢铁公司认真地总结了几个月来和土铁高硫作斗争的经验，最近又改化铁炉冷风为热风，由原来脱硫20％—30％提高到50％—70％，为进一步缩短冶炼时间，提高钢的产量和质量创造了更好的条件。
    从去年第四季度起，重庆钢铁公司开始用土铁混合洋铁炼钢。今年1月份以来，土铁占了很大比重。这些土铁虽然保持了较好的质量，但含硫量仍然相当高，而且各地土铁含硫比例各不相同，脱硫时不易掌握。重庆钢铁公司党委从开始使用土铁时起，就发动群众对高硫展开斗争。他们发动群众讨论土铁能不能炼好钢，怎样用土铁炼好钢等问题，使广大职工深刻地认识了在技术上解决土铁炼好钢问题对于加速发展钢铁工业的重要意义。
    在同高硫斗争过程中，职工们不断试验，不断总结经验，已经逐步掌握了一套比较完整的方法。这就是被人们称为“一条龙”的攻硫法：从原料进厂到钢水出炉共设四道关卡，采取不同的办法来同高硫斗争，不让它混过关去。他们在原材料管理工序设下第一道关卡，加强对土铁的化验工作，把不同成分的土铁分类堆放，做出标记，使冶炼部门一目了然，对原材料的性质心中有数，便于采取不同的冶炼措施。接着，又在化铁炉上设下第二道关卡，即炉内脱硫、槽子内脱硫、铁水包脱硫等办法，使脱硫效率最高达70％，平均达53.6％。二号化铁炉由酸性改为碱性化铁炉后，曾创造四天十六小时的碱性化铁炉炉龄最高纪录。第三关是在平炉内脱硫。他们在冶炼操作上采取了造渣好（多放渣快放渣、早放初期渣），温度好，热工控制好，以及高温操作好的措施，脱硫效果很显著，在炉内可脱掉50％，最高达70％。第四关是在平炉外脱硫，即出钢时在盛桶内加入混合脱硫剂（即苏打，石灰石，云石），并加强搅拌和加强协作配合，脱硫效果一般可达20％左右。这样作的结果，使硫走投无路，取得了和硫作斗争的很大胜利。大平炉曾创造过五点五十八分钟用土铁炼一炉钢的冶炼新纪录。质量一般都合格，并且炼出过优质钢。
    最近，重钢小平炉车间和转炉厂化铁炉的职工实现了改化铁炉冷风为热风的重大技术革新，又进一步提高了脱硫效果。原来，鼓进化铁炉的风都是冷风，由于土铁中含的锰、矽等发热原素少，加进冷风，铁水温度便提不高，只在摄氏一千二百五十到一千三百度左右。在这种情况下，铁水中不能多加脱硫剂（多加更使温度降低，有时甚至冻结起来，因此，冷风是影响脱硫的一个大关键。小平炉和转炉的职工们今年一开始便抓住这个关键，力争把冷风改为热风，以提高铁水温度。在改建过程中，没有现成图纸，他们就自己大胆创造，自己设计、绘图；没有材料，他们就去找废料自己制造。经过几天苦战，终于建成了一座热风炉，从此，鼓进化铁炉的风先通过热风炉，变成了热风，再进入化铁炉内。这座热风化铁炉在1月29日投入生产后，铁水温度由过去平均一千二百五十二度升高到一千三百七十度到一千四百度，加1％的脱硫剂，可脱硫50％到70％，使平均冶炼时间缩短一点二十九分钟，对提高钢的产量和质量的作用很大。
