Hold High the Red Banner of Participating in Labor
Yi Huai

The positive role of grassroots cadres participating in production during the Great Leap Forward last year is already well-known. In this year's Great Leap Forward, this red banner should be held even higher.

Leading production while participating in production has greatly enriched the experience of grassroots cadres in leading production, which is a good condition for this year's Great Leap Forward. However, it is not enough to rely solely on the experience of last year and the year before to lead this year's production. This year's production is very different from previous years. The tasks are more complex, and the targets are even higher. This requires a comprehensive and systematic implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," making technical and management work more meticulous. For example, deep plowing and dense planting require more fertilization and watering, and it must be done at the right time. When to apply what fertilizer and how much water to water must be appropriate to the needs of crop growth. To this end, it is also necessary to organize labor accordingly, reform tools, and improve management techniques. To be comprehensive, systematic, and meticulous, cadres need to further grasp the laws of production. Only by personally participating in production and constantly acquiring new perceptual knowledge, and then raising them to the height of rationality, can we find laws and experiences from them, and then can we effectively lead this year's production. Otherwise, the experience of leading production can only stay at the past level and cannot meet the new requirements, guaranteeing the realization of this year's leap forward targets. As last year, we must carry out mass movements on a large scale. Past experience has proved that no matter how difficult or heavy the task is, as long as the cadres take the lead, the masses will immediately follow. Cadres taking the lead is one of the most effective ways to mobilize the masses and boost their morale. This effective and good experience should be carried forward in this year's mass movement!

After communization, cadres not only have to manage production, but also have to manage the lives of the masses. The production tasks are complex, requiring cadres to be good at following the mass line; managing the lives of the masses requires even closer ties between cadres and the masses. Facts have proved that cadres working together with the masses can not only hear the opinions of the masses more, more truthfully, and more deeply, but also directly discover problems and find solutions in labor. These are the most reliable basis for us to improve our work, test the implementation of policies, and test whether various systems and decisions are correct, and are important ways to give play to the enthusiasm of the masses.

After communization, compared with agricultural cooperatives, the communes have larger families, larger businesses, and more new problems, and the relationship with all aspects is close and complex. Many new problems are in front of us waiting to be solved, and cadres may sometimes have to hold more meetings, and spend more time in the office dealing with problems. In this way, participating in labor will have some difficulties. The business of the commune is complicated, some people have to lead industry, some people have to lead sideline occupations and animal husbandry, and some people have to manage life and welfare undertakings. Everyone lacks experience in how to arrange labor. However, this does not mean that it is impossible or unnecessary to participate in labor. Just sitting in the office holding meetings is not a good way to solve problems. Participating in labor and discussing with the masses in labor can solve problems more realistically. After discovering these new problems, some communes have already made arrangements for work and labor, stipulated the system of cadres participating in labor, and at the same time improved their working methods, reduced meetings, and urged everyone to go deep into the fields to solve problems. Some cadres in some places lead that work themselves and participate in that aspect of labor. In this way, not only can everyone work in a more planned way, but also everyone can work more deeply and have closer ties with the masses. These practices can be promoted.

    高举参加劳动的红旗
    易槐
    基层干部参加生产，对于去年大跃进的积极作用已是人所共知的事情。在今年的大跃进中，应当把这面红旗举得更高。
    在参加生产中领导生产，大大地丰富了基层干部领导生产的经验，这是今年大跃进的一个好条件。可是，如果仅仅靠去年、前年的经验来领导今年的生产，那是十分不够的。今年的生产同往年大不相同。任务更复杂了，指标也更高了。这就必须全面地系统地实施农业上的八字宪法，把技术工作管理工作搞得更细致，例如：耕得深种得密就要多施肥多浇水，而且要做得恰合时宜，什么时候施什么肥、浇多少水，都要恰合作物生长的需要；为此，还需要相应地组织劳动力，改革工具，改进管理技术。要这样全面、系统、细致，就需要干部进一步掌握生产规律。只有亲自参加生产，不断地取得新的感性知识，然后把它们提高到理性的高度，才能从中找出规律和经验，才能有力地领导今年的生产。否则，领导生产的经验就只能停留在过去的水平上，而不能适应新的要求。保证实现今年的跃进指标。和去年一样，要大搞群众运动，过去的经验证明，不论多么艰苦多么繁重的任务，只要干部带头，群众就立即跟上。干部带头干，是发动群众鼓足干劲的最有效的办法之一。这一条行之有效的好经验，应当在今年的群众运动中得到发扬光大！
    公社化以后，干部不仅要管生产，还要管群众生活。生产任务复杂了，需要干部善于走群众路线；管理群众生活，更需要干部和群众有密切的联系。事实证明，干部和群众共同劳动，不仅能够更多、更真实、更深刻地听到群众的意见，而且在劳动中可以直接发现问题，找出解决问题的办法。这些，就是我们改进工作，检验政策的执行情况，检验各种制度、决定是否正确的最可靠的依据，是发挥群众积极性的重要办法。
    公社化以后，比起农业社来，公社家大业大新问题多，和各方面的关系密切而且复杂。不少新问题摆在面前等着解决，干部有时可能要多开一些会议，坐在办公室里处理问题的时间也不免要多一些。这样，参加劳动就会发生一些困难。公社的业务复杂了，有的人要领导工业，有的人要领导副业、牧业，有的人要管理生活福利事业，劳动究竟如何安排，大家还缺少经验。但是，这决不是说就不可能或者不必要参加劳动了。仅仅坐在办公室里开会并不是解决问题的好办法，参加劳动，在劳动中和群众共同切磋商讨，才能更切合实际地解决问题。有些公社在发现了这些新问题以后，已经对工作和劳动进行了安排，规定出了干部参加劳动的制度，同时改进了工作方法，减少会议，督促大家深入田间去解决问题。有些地方的干部，自己领导那项工作，就参加那方面的劳动。这样，不仅使大家劳动得更有计划，而且可以使大家工作更加深入，和群众的联系更加密切。这些作法都是可以提倡的。
