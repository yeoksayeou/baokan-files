　　In our vast motherland, Hailing Island belongs to Yangjiang County, Guangdong Province. If you try to find it on a map, you might have a hard time, because it's just such a tiny little dot. But those who have been there know what a memorable place it is!
　　
　　Groups of white sails from Zhaipo Fishing Port drift on the undulating sea. Zhaipo Town on Hailing Island is built on the western end of the island. Almost all the residents of this town are fishermen. Walking into this town from a narrow street on Zhaipo Wharf, it's easy to spot a very peculiar phenomenon: there are especially many women and children in this town. There are especially many women because the men have all gone out to sea with the fishing boats. Each time they go to sea, it often takes forty or fifty days for them to return, and after each return, they spend two or three days on the island repairing fishing nets and other fishing gear, and then they go back to sea. There are especially many children, which may be related to the unstable lives of the fishermen? If you chat with the people in the town, they will tell you: "In our place, which family doesn't have four or five children?" Therefore, wherever you go in this town, there are groups of children everywhere. The women wear bamboo hats lacquered with tung oil, with the brims pulled down over their foreheads. This is to prevent the fierce wind and rain at sea. There is a hat string attached to their necks, which is also a delicate decoration. The entire string is made of fine glass beads, and colorful glass beads are strung together into various patterns, which look very beautiful. The men go to sea, and the women stay at home. They weave fishing nets and tidy up all kinds of furniture for the boats. Due to the great development of production, the fishing boats in Zhaipo Fishing Port no longer use fishing nets woven with rope. When nylon fishing nets were introduced last spring, the women quickly learned to weave nylon fishing nets. At that time, women in every household were weaving nylon fishing nets. At dusk, it is time for the residents' study class to conduct cultural learning. Because the children are all studying in school, the residents' study class is almost entirely the realm of women. In some spacious rooms, or on the threshing floor in front of their houses, they move small stools and sit together. A blackboard hangs on the wall, with folk songs written on it. An instructor teaches them a few times, and then everyone sings together. Thus, the entire town is filled with songs throughout the dusk.
　　
　　Speaking of singing, perhaps there are few other places where people sing as well as on Hailing Island. Last summer, we participated in a propaganda work conference in Zhaipo. After two days of group discussions, when it came time to speak at the general assembly, it was entirely done through singing folk songs. The venue of the general assembly was on a beach in a square with a mat shed. The seawater roared on the beach from morning to night, the tide ebbed and flowed, and the folk songs were sung from morning until late at night. Some people made suggestions about work in the folk songs, some people challenged and responded in the folk songs, and some people praised the face of socialist construction and the beautiful scenery of future life:
　　
　　…Roads built in every village,
　　
　　Mulberry, locust, bamboo and eucalyptus planted everywhere,
　　
　　Flowers also planted along the road as a foil,
　　
　　River bamboo shadows, a water and cloud village…
　　
　　From the western end of Hailing Island to its eastern end, it is only forty or fifty li, and the widest part from north to south is only about ten li. Several high mountain peaks rising from the island make the entire Hailing Island look so magnificent and majestic. Walking forward along the narrow island, you will pass through roads piled with thick sea sand, and through the villages scattered on the island, shaded by greenery. Windmills spin in the fields, facing the sea breeze. Newly built water gates connect the long dikes built from the beach. The diligent and brave people are cultivating one beautiful field after another on the beach and in the valleys. The whistling sea breeze recalls those distant and ancient stories, and the surging sea tide sings the songs of the heroic people. It is said that in the past, Hailing Island was just a desolate island. Because the island lacked fresh water, and it was often droughty, crops could not grow. Some fishermen living on the island tried every means to open up some small fields to plant crops, but they often did not get any harvest, and often encountered huge tides that swallowed up houses and fields all at once. Last summer, a huge typhoon hit the island, with gale-force winds and torrential rain for days and nights. The monstrous waves roared at sea. After the typhoon stopped, when we looked outside, all the trees, crops, and grass looked like they had been burned by a fire. Many huge trees were uprooted, the crops were all blown down, and all the green leaves, crops, and grass turned a scorched yellow. The already organized, diligent, and hardworking people of Hailing Island, led by the cadres, built countless small sheds in the fields and moved all their families to the fields. They propped up the blown-down crops one by one and nursed them day and night. As a result, Hailing Island achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest last year. The two crops of rice a year turned Hailing Island into a golden expanse.
　　
　　Also in the summer of last year, after the early rice was harvested and the late rice had been transplanted not long after, it was the time to apply the first fertilizer to the late rice fields. We saw a strange scene on Hailing Island: that day, we came to a field and saw piles of fish, like small mounds, that had been brought up from the sea and piled on the edge of the field. Next to each pile of fish sat a person, each holding a large knife, placing the fish, as thick as a hand, on a wooden drill and chopping it like firewood. What was going on? It turned out that it was the fertilizer they were preparing to apply to the fields. Such "small fish" could be caught by the thousands of pounds by just putting a few small boats out to sea in Hailing Island, and they didn't take it seriously. Once, we came to a village, it was already dusk, and we needed to eat dinner in the village. After finding a pot and stove in the village and putting the rice in the pot, a village cadre ran over to tell us that the fishing boats on the beach had just landed and asked if we wanted to buy a fish for dinner. When we heard this, we asked him to buy us a fish on the beach. When he brought the fish back, we saw that it was a fish weighing more than ten catties, which surprised us very much. We said, "How can we eat it all?" But he said, "There's no smaller one. It doesn't matter, we can eat even bigger ones here. I'll help you prepare it…" As he spoke, he started to work. As a result, not only did he stew a pot, but he also braised a pot and fried a large bowl. It took several of us a lot of effort to finish it. Later, when I think of Hailing Island, I can't help but think of that rich dinner. In the market towns of Hailing Island, there are often fish weighing one hundred and dozens of catties being slaughtered and sold. There is a kind of large fish that the locals call sea pig. Except for not having legs or fur, and having a fish tail, it does look like a pig. It has black skin, a round belly, and two rows of snow-white teeth in its mouth. I have seen people slaughtering sea pigs for sale in the market towns of Hailing Island more than once. An ordinary sea pig weighs more than one hundred catties, and the blood slaughtered from it fills a large basin. Once a sea pig is slaughtered, everything, including the fish belly, fish intestines, and fish blood, is quickly sold out in the market town.
　　
　　The rich Hailing Island, like every piece of land in our motherland, is where there are our diligent, brave, and intelligent people, and where the miracles of life will appear. On a clear day, on Hailing Island, looking at the vast waves outside the island, and the floating rice waves on the island... This is our motherland. No matter where you are, there are paradises built by our people everywhere.

### 鱼乡帆影怀海陵

    鱼乡帆影怀海陵
    白原文  郁风图
    在我们祖国辽阔的疆土上，海陵岛属于广东省的阳江县。如果从地图上去找，也许很难找得到，因为在地图上，它只有那么小的一丁点。可是到过那里的人都知道，那是一个多么使人怀念的地方！
    从闸坡渔港出海的一群一群的白帆，在波涛起伏的大海上飘荡。海陵岛上的闸坡镇，就建筑在海岛的西端。居住在这个镇子里的，差不多全部是渔民。从闸坡码头上的一条窄窄的街道走进这个镇子里去，很容易就可以发现一种很特异的现象：在这个镇子里，妇女特别多，小孩也特别多。妇女特别多是因为男人都随着渔船出海去了。他们每次出海，常常要四、五十天才能回来，而每次回来以后，在岛上修理修理渔网和其他捕鱼工具，在家里住两三天，就又到海上去了。他们的小孩特别多，不知是不是和渔民的不太安定的生活也有关系？和镇上的人们拉起家常来，他们就会对你说：“在我们这里，哪一家没有四、五个小孩？”因此在这个镇子里，无论走到哪里，到处都是一群一群的小孩。那些妇女们，头上戴一顶帽沿向下罩过额头的用桐油油过的竹帽。这是为了预防海上的狂暴的风雨。帽子下面有一根帽带子套在她们的脖子上，同时也是一件精致的装饰品，整条带子都是她们用细玻璃珠子串起来的，一颗颗彩色的玻璃珠子串成各种各样的花彩，显得十分美丽。男人们到海上去了，妇女们留在家里，她们编渔网、打整各种各样的船上用的家具。由于生产大发展，现在闸坡渔港的渔船都不用绳子编的渔网了。去年春天改用尼龙渔网的时候，妇女们很快就都学会了编尼龙渔网。那时候，家家户户的妇女们都在编尼龙渔网。到了黄昏，这是镇上的居民学习班进行文化学习的时间。小孩们因为都在学校里学习，所以在居民学习班里，那就几乎全是妇女们的天下了。她们在一些宽敞的屋子里，或者就在门前的场子上搬张小凳子坐在一起，墙上挂着一块黑板，黑板上写着山歌，由一位教员教上几遍，大家就一起唱起来。于是在整个黄昏的镇子上，到处响遍了歌声。
    说到唱歌，恐怕很少有别的地方能像海陵岛上的人们那样会唱的了。去年夏天，我们在闸坡参加了次宣传工作会议，经过两天的小组讨论，到大会发言的时候，完全都是唱的山歌。大会的会场就在一片海滩上的一个搭着席棚的广场上。海水在沙滩上从早到晚一阵阵喧响，海潮退了又涨了，山歌从早上一直唱到夜深。有的人在山歌里对工作提意见，有的人在山歌里进行挑战和应战，有的人就歌颂社会主义建设的面貌和将来生活的美景：
    ……村村修起车路网，
    遍种桑槐竹与桉，
    路边还种鲜花衬，
    河流竹影水云乡……
    从海陵岛的西端到它的东端，一共不过四、五十里，而南北最宽的地方只不过十来里。从海岛上耸立起来的好几座高高的山峰，使整个海陵岛显得这样瑰丽，这样雄伟。沿着狭长的岛屿向前走去，一路上经过厚厚的海沙堆积的道路，穿过那些散布在岛上的一个个绿荫掩映的乡村，风车迎着海风在田野上旋转，新建的水闸连接着从海滩上修筑起来的长堤，勤劳勇敢的人民，在海滩上，在峡谷里经营起一片又一片美丽的田园。呼啸的海风追忆着那些遥远的古老的故事，奔腾的海潮唱着英雄的人民的歌曲。据说在从前，海陵岛只是一个荒凉的海岛，因为岛上缺少淡水，而且常常天旱，庄稼无法生长，居住在岛上的一些渔民想尽各种办法，开辟了一些小小的田地把庄稼种下，却常常得不到一点收获，而且常常遇到巨大的海潮，一下子就把房屋、田地都通通吞没了。去年夏天，岛上来了一次巨大的台风，狂风暴雨刮了几天几夜，滔天的巨浪在海上呼吼。等到台风停了以后，到外面一看，所有的树木、庄稼、青草就像被一场烈火烧过的一样。许多巨大的树木被连根拔起，庄稼都吹倒了，所有的绿叶、庄稼、青草变成了一片焦黄。已经组织起来的勤劳、刻苦的海陵岛上的人民，由干部带头，在田头搭起无数小棚，通通把家搬到田头上。他们把吹倒的庄稼一棵棵扶起来，日夜进行护理。结果海陵岛在去年一年获得了从未有过的大丰收，一年两熟的稻穗使海陵岛变成一片金黄。
    也就在去年的夏天，早稻收割了以后，晚稻插完秧没有多久，正是晚造稻田施第一次肥的时候，我们在海陵岛上看到了一幅奇异的景象：那一天，我们来到了一片田野上，看见一堆堆像小土堆一样从海上打上来的鱼堆在田头上，在每个鱼堆的旁边坐着一个人，每人拿着一把大刀，把一条条手干一般粗的鱼搁在木钻上像砍木柴一样地砍。怎么回事？原来那是他们准备施到田里的肥料。像这样的“小鱼”，在海陵岛，只要架上几只小船到海上去，一捞几千斤，不当一回事。有一次，我们来到一个村子里，已经是黄昏，需要在村子里吃一顿晚饭，在村里找好锅灶，把米下了锅，一位村里的干部跑来告诉我们说，海滩上的渔船刚靠岸，问我们要不要买条鱼做晚饭。我们一听，就请他在海边上替我们买条鱼，等他把鱼提回来我们一看，却是一条十几斤重的鱼，弄得我们十分惊讶，对他说怎么吃得完？可是他说：“没有更小的了，不要紧，在我们这里，比这更大的也吃得完，我帮你们弄……”他一边说着一边就动起手来，结果炖了一锅还不算，又焖了一瓦盆，煎了一大钵，我们几个人费了好大劲才把它吃完。以后，想起海陵岛，总不能不想起那一顿丰富的晚餐。在海陵岛的集镇上，经常有一百几十斤的鱼宰开来卖。有一种大鱼，当地人叫做海猪，除了没有腿，没有毛，尾巴是鱼尾巴以外，样子也的确像猪，黑色的皮肤，圆滚滚的肚皮，嘴里还有两排雪白的牙齿。我不止一次在海陵岛的集镇上看见人们在宰海猪来卖，一头普普通通的海猪就有一百多斤，宰下来的血也有一大盆。一头海猪宰开来，在集镇上很快就连鱼肚、鱼肠、鱼血一起都通通卖光了。
    富饶的海陵岛，就像在我们祖国的每一片土地上一样，哪里有我们勤劳勇敢的聪明的人民，哪里生活的奇迹就会出现。在晴朗的日子，在海陵岛上，看岛外波涛万顷，岛上一片飘荡的稻浪……这就是我们的祖国，不管海角天涯，处处都有我们人民建设的乐园。
