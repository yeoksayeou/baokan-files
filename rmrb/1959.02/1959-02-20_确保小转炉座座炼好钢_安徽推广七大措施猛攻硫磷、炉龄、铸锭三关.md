    Ensure Every Small Converter Furnace Refines Good Steel
    Anhui Promotes Seven Measures to Vigorously Attack the Three Barriers of Sulfur and Phosphorus, Furnace Age, and Ingot Casting
    (Our newspaper, Hefei, February 19th dispatch) In order to fully utilize existing equipment to produce more good steel and good materials, Anhui Province recently summarized the experience of small converter steelmaking throughout the province and decided to promote seven major measures to improve the quality and output of small converter steel.
    Currently, Anhui Province has built 607 small converters ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 tons. According to the designed capacity, they can produce 210,000 to 220,000 tons of steel. The vast majority of steel ingots, small steel castings, and small steel forgings required by the province's small rolling mills must be produced by these small converters. Improving the output and quality of small converter steel is of urgent significance at present.
    After studying the production situation of small converters, relevant departments in Anhui Province believe that to improve the quality of small converter steel at present, three major technical barriers must be broken: the sulfur and phosphorus barrier, the furnace age barrier, and the ingot casting barrier. In order to break through these three barriers, relevant departments have summarized seven major measures and decided to promote them immediately. These seven major measures are:
    1. Promote alkaline small converters. Use the province's abundant reserves of dolomite to replace magnesite, which needs to be supplied from other places, as the lining of small converters. Using this alkaline furnace to make steel can reduce the sulfur and phosphorus content. At present, Hefei and Huainan have successfully tested the use of raw dolomite as furnace lining for steelmaking. The steel produced by this furnace is of very good quality. According to analysis and testing, the sulfur content of the steel is 0.04% to 0.08%, and the phosphorus content is below 0.05%.
    2. Promote neutral or alkaline cupola furnaces. When the sulfur and phosphorus content of pig iron is too high, the sulfur content of steel may still not meet the standard by using alkaline converters alone. Therefore, measures must also be taken from the cupola furnace. Using an alkaline or neutral cupola furnace for primary desulfurization can remove about 50% of the sulfur; then, using an alkaline converter for blowing, the sulfur content can be reduced to meet the standard.
    3. Promote external desulfurization. Adding 50% lime, 20% coke powder or salt, and 30% fluorite to the molten iron ladle, with the total weight of the three raw materials accounting for about 2% of the weight of the molten iron, can remove 50% of the sulfur.
    4. Promote double-row tuyeres to increase furnace temperature. In the past, single-row tuyeres were used for blowing in small converters, resulting in low furnace temperatures, which easily caused freezing and made ingot casting difficult. The Anhui Provincial Steel Plant used double-row tuyeres for blowing, which increased the furnace temperature by 50 to 80 degrees, improved the qualified rate of steel, and shortened the blowing time. Blowing a 0.2-ton converter with a single-row tuyere takes 20 to 30 minutes, while a double-row tuyere only takes 15 to 20 minutes. The double-row tuyeres are made by opening another row of tuyeres above the original tuyeres of the converter, 240 mm inside the furnace and 300 mm outside the shell, inclined at 30 degrees. Coordinating with the lower tuyeres to aim at the center of the molten steel surface for blowing can increase the furnace temperature.
    5. Implement operating procedures and ensure that the particle size of the dolomite lining is 40% at 3 to 8 mm, 20% at 1 to 3 mm, and 40% at 0.5 mm. The ratio of dolomite to binder is 9:1. The furnace lining must be rammed firmly and evenly. At the same time, the use of tuyere bricks and hot patching methods must be promoted to increase the number of blowing cycles. Doing so can extend the blowing of small converters from a dozen heats to more than thirty heats, or even more.
    6. Adopt steel ingot mold casting. In the past, sand mold casting was used, which resulted in a low qualified rate and poor quality of steel ingots, making rolling difficult. In order to improve the qualified rate of steel ingots and ensure that the steel can be made into materials, it has been decided to promote iron mold casting, and each furnace must be equipped with three ingot molds.
    7. Put politics in command. Leading cadres should take the lead and, with the spirit of overcoming the ironmaking technical barrier last year, overcome the steelmaking technical barrier. Conduct thorough ideological and political work, personally lead the research of key technologies, and mobilize the masses to exert their utmost efforts, work hard, and work skillfully.
    Anhui Province requires that these methods be promoted so that the qualified rate of steel in all small converters reaches 70% to 80% in the first quarter; the furnace age of each small converter reaches 30 to 35 heats; the utilization coefficient of small converters reaches 7.5 to 8, and steel is produced 30 to 40 times every 24 hours; and one out of every three converters is in continuous production. At present, all parts of the province are actively promoting these seven major measures.

    确保小转炉座座炼好钢
    安徽推广七大措施猛攻硫磷、炉龄、铸锭三关
    本报合肥19日电　为了充分利用现有设备多产好钢好材，安徽省最近总结了全省小转炉炼钢的经验，决定推广七大措施，提高小转炉钢的质量和产量。
    现在，安徽省已建零点一到零点五吨的小转炉六百零七个，按设计能力计算，可产钢二十一到二十二万吨。全省小型轧钢机需用的钢锭、小铸钢件、小锻钢件，绝大部分都要由这些小转炉生产。提高小转炉的产量和钢的质量，在目前具有迫切的意义。
    安徽省有关部门研究了小转炉的生产情况后认为，当前要提高小转炉钢的质量，必须突破三大技术关，这就是硫磷关，炉龄关和铸锭关。为了突破这三关，有关部门总结了七大措施，决定立即加以推广。这七大措施是：
    一、推广碱性小转炉。用本省蕴藏量丰富的白云石，代替需要靠外地供应的镁砂做小转炉的炉衬。用这种碱性炉炼钢，可以降低硫磷成分。现在，合肥、淮南已经试用生白云石做炉衬炼钢成功。用这种炉子炼的钢质量很好。据分析化验，钢的含硫量为0.04％到0.08％，含磷量在0.05％以下。
    二、推广中性或碱性化铁炉。在生铁含硫磷量过多的情况下，单用碱性转炉炼钢，钢的含硫量还不能符合标准，所以还要从化铁炉方面采取措施。采用碱性或中性化铁炉进行一次脱硫，可以脱硫50％左右；再用碱性转炉吹炼，硫的成分就可以减少到合乎标准。
    三、推广炉外脱硫。在铁水包里加石灰50％，焦炭粉或食盐20％，莹石30％，三种原料总重量占铁水重量的2％左右，就可以脱去50％的硫。
    四、推广双排风眼，提高炉温。过去小转炉单排风眼吹炼，炉温不高，容易冻结，铸锭困难。安徽省委钢铁厂用双排风眼吹炼，炉温提高五十度到八十度，提高了钢的合格率，同时缩短了吹炼时间。单排风眼吹炼一个零点二吨的转炉要二十到三十分钟，双排风眼只要十五到二十分钟。双排风眼是在转炉原来的排风眼的上方，炉内二百四十公厘、炉外壳三百公厘的地方再开一排风眼，倾斜三十度，配合下面的风眼对准钢水液面中心吹炼，可以提高炉温。
    五、贯彻操作规程，保证白云石炉衬的粒度为三到八公厘40％，一到三公厘20％，零点五公厘40％。白云石和结合剂的配合比为九比一。炉衬打结要实要匀，同时必须推广用风眼砖，推广热补办法提高吹炼次数。这样做可以把小转炉的吹炼由十几炉延长到三十多炉，或者更多。
    六、采用钢锭模铸锭。过去用砂模铸锭，合格率低，钢锭的质量差，不好轧制。为了提高钢锭合格率，保证钢能成材，决定推行铁模铸锭，每炉必须配备三只锭模。
  七、政治挂帅。领导干部上阵，以去年攻破炼铁技术关的精神，攻破炼钢技术关。深入地做好思想政治工作，并且要亲自领导研究技术关键，发动群众鼓足干劲，实干巧干。
    安徽省要求推广这些办法，使所有小转炉在第一季度内钢的合格率达到70％到80％；每个小转炉的炉龄要达到三十到三十五炉；小转炉的利用系数要求达到七点五至八，每一昼夜出钢三十至四十次；每三个转炉中要做到一个炉经常生产。目前，全省各地都在积极推广这七大措施。
