Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd. Over the past month, some regions that have not yet completed their agricultural product procurement tasks are seizing the opportunity to launch a large-scale procurement campaign, striving to complete the task quickly and well.

    The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has held five telephone conferences in the past half-month, making specific arrangements for the procurement work. Many areas in the province quickly set off a high tide of procurement. In the Yulin area, more than 130,000 people and more than 500 cadres were put into the procurement campaign, using 57,000 livestock and more than 2,700 carts for collection and transportation. The province's grain warehousing progress has greatly accelerated, increasing by 1.3 times in mid-January compared to early January; the purchase volume of live pigs has also increased by 2.9 times. Hubei Province has also mobilized more than 300,000 people and a large number of vehicles and ships to invest in the campaign, and the procurement and transfer progress has been significantly accelerated. As of January 25, the province had completed 73% of its oil procurement plan. In addition to holding telephone conferences, Anhui Province also held a broadcast conference attended by 330,000 commercial employees, mobilizing commercial workers throughout the province to continue to exert their energy to complete the annual procurement tasks. In the key tobacco-producing area of ​​Bengbu, more than 10,000 people are grading and weighing tobacco leaves every day; the key hemp-producing areas have also changed the method of hemp stripping and assigned the hemp stripping task to households, which has significantly accelerated the hemp procurement progress. For example, the average daily collection of hemp was 245 dan in mid-January, and the average daily collection was 2,087 dan in the first three days of late January, an increase of more than seven times.

    In the agricultural product procurement work, various regions have also paid attention to mobilizing the vast number of commune members to "pick clean and pick dry," ensuring that no cotton fluff is missed and every grain is returned home. This not only increased the income of communes and members, but also expanded the source of agricultural products. The five areas of Shijiazhuang, Handan, Baoding, Tangshan, and Tianjin in Hebei Province mobilized more than 1.6 million people to carry out the "three searches" campaign in cotton fields (namely, finding fallen cotton, stiff petal cotton, and eyelash cotton). As of mid-January, they had found more than 60 million jin of seed cotton, averaging 8 jin per mu. In Rizhao County, Shandong, ten townships mobilized 55,000 semi-labor forces to recover 1.2 million jin of peanut fruits in 50,000 mu of peanut fields, an increase of more than 20 jin per mu. In Xushui County, Hebei, women and primary school students were given holidays to go to the fields to recover sweet potatoes, grain, and cotton. According to incomplete statistics from several communes, more than 1,000 jin of cotton, and about 1 million jin of various grains, fresh potatoes, dried potatoes, peanuts, and vegetables have been recovered. The commercial departments have purchased these recovered products, and the lower quality sweet potatoes are used for brewing. After the launch of the picking clean and picking dry campaign, not only has the state's procurement volume been expanded, but also the income of the people's communes has been increased. For example, after Leting County mobilized the masses to find 224,400 jin of seed cotton and sell it to the state, the commune's income increased by more than 44,400 yuan.

    The procurement departments in many regions have learned from the procurement work in this period that, due to the unprecedented bumper harvest of agricultural production in my country in 1958, the output of agricultural products is very abundant. At present, there are still considerable amounts of commodity oils, grains, and cotton stored in commune members' homes, in cultivated areas, and in people's communes. As long as all regions continue to carry out meticulous work and deeply mobilize the masses, it is entirely possible to successfully complete the annual agricultural product procurement plan.

### 尽快尽好地完成收购计划  各地发动群众掀起农产品采购高潮

    尽快尽好地完成收购计划
    各地发动群众掀起农产品采购高潮
    新华社2日讯　最近一个月来，部分尚未完成农产品采购任务的地区，正抓紧时机大搞收购运动，力争尽快尽好的完成任务。
    中共陕西省委在最近半个月中先后召开了五次电话会议，对收购工作作了具体部署。这个省的不少地区很快就掀起了收购的高潮。榆林专区投入收购运动的群众达十三万多人、干部五百多人，运用了五万七千头牲口、二千七百多辆大车，随收随运。全省的粮食入仓进度大大加快，一月中旬较上旬增加了一点三倍；生猪收购量也增加了二点九倍。湖北省也动员了三十多万人，和大批车辆、船舶投入了运动，收购和调运进度显著加快。截至1月25日，这个省的油料收购计划已经完成73％。安徽省除召开电话会议以外，还举行了有三十三万商业职工参加的广播大会，动员全省商业工作人员继续鼓足干劲完成全年收购任务。这个省的重点产烟区蚌埠地区每天有一万多人进行烟叶的分级磅码工作；重点产麻区也改变了大麻的剥制方法，并将剥麻任务分配到户，这样就使大麻的收购进度显著加快，如1月中旬日收大麻二百四十五担，下旬的头三天平均日收二千零八十七担，增加了七倍多。
    各地在农产品收购工作中还注意发动广大社员“摘干拣净”，做到朵絮不漏、颗粒还家，这样不仅增加了公社和社员收入，也扩大了农产品货源。河北省石家庄、邯郸、保定、唐山、天津五个专区发动一百六十多万人开展了棉田的“三找”运动（即找落地棉、僵瓣棉、眼睫毛棉），截至1月中旬就找到籽棉六千多万斤，平均每亩收到八斤。山东日照县的十个乡发动整半劳动力五万五千人，在五万亩花生地里复收花生果一百二十万斤，每亩增加二十多斤。河北徐水县放假让妇女、小学生下地复收红薯、粮食、棉花，据几个公社的不完全统计，已收到棉花一千多斤，各种粮食、鲜薯、薯干、花生、菜类等共一百万斤左右。商业部门对于这些复收的产品都加以收购，质量较差的红薯就用来酿酒。摘干拣净运动开展后，不仅扩大了国家的收购量，同时也增加了人民公社的收入。如乐亭县发动群众找回籽棉二十二万四千斤卖给国家后，就使公社增加收入四万四千多元。
    许多地区的收购部门从这一时期的收购工作中体会到，由于1958年我国农业生产的空前丰收，农产品的产量是十分丰富的，目前在社员个人、在耕作区、在人民公社都还存着相当数量的商品油料、粮食和棉花，只要各地继续进行细致的工作，深入发动群众，胜利地完成全年农产品收购计划是完全可能的。
