Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The head of the All-China Sports Federation today issued a statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters, expressing the Chinese sports community's gratitude for the Soviet and Bulgarian teams' resolute refusal to compete against the Chiang Kai-shek group's so-called "Taiwan basketball team" in the Third World Men's Basketball Championship, and lodging a solemn protest against the unreasonable decision made by the International Amateur Basketball Federation regarding the Soviet and Bulgarian teams. The full text of the statement is as follows:

　　At the Third World Men's Basketball Championship held in Santiago, Chile, from January 16 to 31 this year, the Soviet and Bulgarian teams refused to compete against the Chiang Kai-shek group's so-called "Taiwan basketball team," and solemnly pointed out that the Chiang gang's so-called "representative team" does not represent anyone, and only the People's Republic of China's representative team can represent Chinese athletes. This solemn action by the Soviet and Bulgarian comrades is a heavy blow to the political plot of creating "two Chinas" painstakingly engineered by the International Amateur Basketball Federation under the manipulation of imperialist elements; it is a powerful support for our struggle in international sports organizations to smash the political plot of "two Chinas."

　　On August 19, 1958, after our All-China Sports Federation solemnly declared its withdrawal from the organization in order to smash the political plot of creating "two Chinas" by U.S. imperialism in FIBA, the Soviet Basketball Association sent a letter to FIBA in September of the same year, requesting the expulsion of the Chiang gang's so-called sports organization and the restoration of the All-China Sports Federation's legitimate rights in FIBA. Before this World Championship, the Soviet Basketball Association also notified the organizers of the championship and FIBA, declaring that the Soviet team would never compete against the Chiang gang team. The Bulgarian Sports Association's basketball department also made the same solemn statement. However, FIBA President Graeme (an American) ignored the solemn statements of the Soviet and Bulgarian basketball organizations and stubbornly served the political plot of U.S. imperialism to create "two Chinas" and "Taiwan independence," insisting on allowing the Chiang gang's so-called "representative team" to participate in the Third World Men's Basketball Championship.

　　It must be pointed out that FIBA's conspiracy to create "two Chinas" has a long history. As early as the 1952 FIBA Congress, under the manipulation of people like Graeme, disregarding the resolute protests of Chinese and Soviet representatives, and violating its own charter, while continuing to recognize the All-China Sports Federation's legitimate status in FIBA, it also recognized the Chiang gang's so-called "China National Amateur Athletic Federation," nakedly exposing the ugly faces of imperialist elements like Graeme. After we resolutely withdrew from FIBA, they continued to quibble on the one hand, and on the other hand, they refused the Soviet Union's request to expel the Chiang gang's so-called sports organization. At this World Championship, FIBA went even further, not only unreasonably rejecting the just demands of the Soviet and Bulgarian basketball teams, but also canceling the points scored by the Soviet and Bulgarian teams in the finals after the competition. This further exposed that FIBA, under the manipulation of imperialist elements, has become a tool for U.S. imperialism to conspire to create "two Chinas."

　　The just attitude of the Soviet and Bulgarian basketball teams has received the support of the vast majority of upright people. No matter how hard the imperialists try to limit the ever-expanding influence of the socialist camp countries led by the Soviet Union, and attempt to belittle the brilliant achievements of the socialist camp countries in sports, they are bound to be completely bankrupt. In this World Basketball Championship, the Soviet team won five games and defeated the defending champion U.S. team by a huge margin, and has actually won the honor of world champion. Graeme and his ilk, who are willing to serve U.S. imperialism, panicked and went to such a despicable and shameless extent, even resorting to despicable means never seen in the history of world sports, and actually canceled all the scores of the Soviet and Bulgarian basketball teams. But can this erase the great victory of the Soviet delegation? No, on the contrary, it only proves how degenerate Graeme and his ilk have become!

　　The Chinese sports community thanks the Soviet and Bulgarian comrades for their great support for our struggle against the "two Chinas" plot in international sports organizations, and extends our heartfelt congratulations to the glorious achievements of the Soviet and Bulgarian athletes!

    我体育总会负责人发表谈话
    谴责国际篮联的无理决定
    感谢苏保球队反对“两个中国”阴谋的严正举动
    新华社3日讯　中华全国体育总会负责人今天对新华社记者发表谈话，对苏联和保加利亚代表队在第三届世界男子篮球锦标赛中坚决拒绝同蒋介石集团的所谓“台湾篮球队”进行比赛一事，表示了中国体育界的感谢，并严正抗议国际业余篮球联合会对于苏、保代表队所作出的无理决定。谈话全文如下：
    在今年1月16日至31日在智利圣地亚哥举行的第三届世界男子篮球锦标赛上，苏联和保加利亚代表队拒绝同蒋介石集团的所谓“台湾篮球队”进行比赛，并严正地指出，蒋帮的所谓“代表队”不代表任何人，只有中华人民共和国的代表队，才能代表中国运动员。苏联和保加利亚同志这一严正的举动，是对国际业余篮球联合会在帝国主义分子操纵下处心积虑制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋的一个沉重打击；是对我们在国际体育组织中进行粉碎“两个中国”政治阴谋斗争的一个有力支持。
    在1958年8月19日，我中华全国体育总会为了粉碎美帝国主义在国际篮联中制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋而庄严申明退出该组织后，苏联篮球协会在同年9月即曾致函国际篮联，要求开除蒋帮的所谓体育组织，恢复中华全国体育总会在国际篮联中的合法权利。在这次世界锦标赛前，苏联篮球协会又通知锦标赛的组织者和国际篮联，声明苏联队决不同蒋帮队比赛。保加利亚体育协会篮球部亦作出了同样的严正的声明。但是，国际篮联主席格雷姆（美国人）竟无视苏、保篮球组织的严正声明，顽固地为美帝国主义制造“两个中国”和“台湾独立”的政治阴谋效劳，坚持让蒋帮的所谓“代表队”，参加第三届世界男子篮球锦标赛。
    必须指出，国际篮联阴谋制造“两个中国”由来已久。早在1952年的国际篮联代表大会上，在格雷姆之流的操纵下，不顾中、苏代表的坚决抗议，违背自己的章程，在继续承认中华全国体育总会在国际篮联中合法地位的同时，又承认蒋帮的所谓“中华全国体育协进会”，赤裸裸地暴露了格雷姆等人的帝国主义分子的嘴脸。当我们坚决退出国际篮联后，他们一方面继续狡辩；另一方面又拒绝苏联提出的驱逐蒋帮的所谓体育组织的要求。在这次世界锦标赛上，国际篮联更变本加厉地不仅无理拒绝了苏联和保加利亚篮球队的正义要求，而且在比赛结束后，竟又取消苏、保两队在决赛中所得的分数。这就进一步暴露了国际篮联在帝国主义分子的操纵下，已经成为美帝国主义阴谋制造“两个中国”的一个工具了。
    苏联和保加利亚篮球队的正义态度，得到了广大正直人士的支持。不论帝国主义者如何千方百计地企图限制以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国日益扩大的影响，企图贬低社会主义阵营各国在体育运动上获得的辉煌成就，都是一定要彻底破产的。在这次世界篮球锦标赛中，苏联队五战五胜，以巨大比数击败了上届冠军美国队，实际上已经取得世界冠军的荣誉。甘心为美帝国主义效劳的格雷姆之流慌作一团，竟然下流无耻到这种地步，居然拿出世界体育史上从来没有见过的卑劣手段，把苏、保篮球队的得分全部取消。但是，这样就能把苏联代表队的伟大胜利一笔抹煞吗？不，恰恰相反，这不过证明格雷姆之流已经堕落到怎样不堪的地步！
    中国体育界感谢苏联和保加利亚同志对我们在国际体育组织中反对“两个中国”阴谋的斗争的巨大支持，并对苏联和保加利亚运动员的光辉成就致以衷心的祝贺！
