Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Vice Foreign Ministers Luo Guibo and Zeng Yongquan received Soviet Charge d'Affaires ad interim to China, Antonov, and British Charge d'Affaires ad interim to China, Wen Yusheng, on February 19th, respectively, and presented them with Foreign Minister Chen Yi's letter to Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, regarding the issue of the Kingdom of Laos and the United States unilaterally abandoning the Geneva Accords. They also presented copies of Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement of February 18th on the same issue. The content of Foreign Minister Chen's letter to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference is as follows:

"I would like to draw your attention to the statements and talks made by Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, Phoui Sananikone, on February 11, 1959, and by the spokesperson of the US State Department on February 12, 1959, regarding Laos no longer fulfilling the Geneva Accords. The Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos believes that Laos will no longer be bound by the Geneva Accords and opposes the continued activities of the International Commission for Laos. The spokesperson of the US State Department not only openly supports this unilateral act of seriously undermining the Geneva Accords and peace in Indochina, but also brazenly declares that the United States will 'freely' send military missions to Laos. At the same time, the US government is sending large numbers of military personnel and transporting weapons into Laos. These are not only perfidious and illegal acts of tearing up the Geneva Accords, but also directly violate the opinion expressed by the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference in their letter of January 31, 1959, to the Indian government and the Chairman of the International Commission for Laos, that the International Commission for Laos should continue its activities. The Chinese government expresses its firm opposition to the unilateral abandonment of the Geneva Accords by the Kingdom of Laos and the United States.

"In view of the above serious situation, the Chinese government requests the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to take swift action regarding this serious act of undermining the Geneva Accords, in order to stop the US military intervention plot in Laos and maintain peace in the Indochina region."

    陈毅外长写信给葛罗米柯和劳埃德
    反对老挝和美国毁弃日内瓦协议
    要求迅速制止美国对老挝的军事干涉阴谋，维护印度支那和平
    新华社20日讯　中华人民共和国外交部副部长罗贵波和曾涌泉于2月19日分别接见了苏联驻华临时代办安东诺夫和英国驻华代办文郁生，向他们递交了陈毅外交部长就老挝王国和美国片面毁弃日内瓦协议问题给关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议两主席苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和英国外交大臣劳埃德的信，同时递交了陈毅外长2月18日关于同一问题的声明副本。陈外长给日内瓦会议两主席信的内容如下：
    “我谨提请您注意老挝王国政府首相培·萨纳尼空于1959年2月11日和美国国务院发言人于1959年2月12日关于老挝不再履行日内瓦协议的声明和谈话。老挝王国政府首相认为老挝将不再受日内瓦协议的约束，并且反对老挝国际委员会继续活动，而美国国务院发言人不仅公开支持这一严重破坏日内瓦协议和印度支那和平的片面行为，而且还扬言美国将‘自由地’向老挝派遣军事使团。与此同时，美国政府正在大量派遣军事人员和运送武器进入老挝。这些不仅是撕毁日内瓦协议的背信弃义的非法行为，也直接违反了日内瓦会议两主席1959年1月31日给印度政府和老挝国际委员会主席信中所表示的老挝国际委员会应继续活动的意见。中国政府对于老挝王国和美国片面毁弃日内瓦协议的行为表示坚决反对。
    “鉴于以上严重情况，中国政府要求日内瓦会议两主席对于这一严重破坏日内瓦协议的行为迅速采取行动，以制止美国对老挝的军事干涉阴谋，维护印度支那地区的和平。”
