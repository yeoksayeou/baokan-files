Guangdong, Ningxia, Jiangxi
Most Areas Ready for Spring Plowing

Guangzhou, February 26th (reporting). Guangdong Province has basically completed its preparations for spring plowing, and spring cultivation has started ahead of schedule.

After the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the resounding call to the people of the province on February 6th to "Seize the favorable situation, rouse soaring enthusiasm, and be determined to achieve a greater leap forward in grain production in 1959," the local Party committees, county committees, and commune Party committees held emergency meetings. They unanimously and enthusiastically responded to the Provincial Committee's call, revised this year's grain production plans, increased measures to increase production, and continuously held oath-taking rallies attended by thousands upon thousands of people. At the same time, they all quickly, according to the task and proportion, appropriately reduced personnel from other production fronts to support the main attack front of early-rice grain production, so that the number of people working on the province's grain production front quickly increased from more than six million in the past to more than ten million (accounting for 60% of the total rural labor force), maximizing the needs of the current early-rice grain production for labor.

While mobilizing the rural labor force to support the grain front, the Party committees at all levels in Guangdong Province also reconfigured the strength of cadres in accordance with the spirit of ensuring that the grain marshal urgently ascends to command. The first secretaries of the prefectural committees, county committees, and district committees have grasped the early-rice grain production with greater energy, and the secretary of the Party Committee Secretariat in charge of agriculture has been increased.

Up to recently, the preparation for plowing has been basically successfully completed. The 25 million mu of basic farmland for grain production now has the ability to resist drought for more than three months. The deep-plowed land has reached 28 million mu, and the early-rice grain crops have an average of about 1,100 dan of fertilizer per mu. At present, from the Chaoshan Plain to the Pearl River Delta, from the Leizhou Peninsula to the northern Guangdong mountainous area, everywhere presents a busy scene of plowing. Many places are crowded with people and extremely lively. Plowing fields, transporting fertilizers, sowing seeds, and raising seedlings are all advancing simultaneously, competing for the spring scenery. The province can fully enter the busy season of rice transplanting across the board in early March. (Yang Weiqun)

Yinchuan, February 26th (reporting). In the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, known as the "Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall," the bugle call for spring cultivation has already sounded.

In recent days, Hui and Han commune members, accounting for more than 80% of the region's labor force, have invested in the intense spring plowing and sowing work, such as transporting fertilizer, spreading manure, plowing land, harrowing, and sowing seeds. At present, all counties and cities along the Yellow River have generally started sowing, and the southern mountainous area will also sow around the "Vernal Equinox."

This year, the biggest features of spring plowing production in the Autonomous Region are early action, quick grasping, high quality, and great momentum. Since communization, labor and means of production have been unified on a larger scale and used more rationally and effectively than before. As soon as the autumn harvest ended last year, the people's communes in various places used more than 200,000 able-bodied laborers to tightly grasp deep plowing, fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy, etc. By the end of last year, all summer farmland had been deep-plowed. This year, the amount of fertilizer accumulated in the region has increased significantly compared to last year, and the quality is also good. On the eve of spring sowing, most communes have delivered the fertilizer needed for summer farmland to the fields. Many communes have implemented a basic fertilizer system, pre-delivering high-quality fertilizers such as human manure and urine, pig and sheep manure to basic farmland, so that each mu of basic farmland is applied with 30 to 60 cartloads of good fertilizer. Since last winter, some medium and small-sized water conservancy projects in mountainous and plain areas have also insisted on construction. Most of the ten large and medium-sized reservoirs built in the arid mountainous areas in the south strive to be able to irrigate in spring and summer this year.

In order to earnestly implement rational close planting, on the eve of spring sowing, various communes concentrated skilled craftsmen, and used the method of master leading apprentice to rush to manufacture and modify a large number of spring sowing and plowing tools such as close planting drills, and also held on-site meetings and training classes to train a large number of spring sowing technical personnel such as drill operators to ensure that wheat sowing not only meets the requirements of close planting, but also improves quality. Various communes also used methods such as adjustment and exchange to prepare improved wheat varieties in advance, and comprehensively carried out seed selection, chemical dressing, and fertilizer dressing to eliminate pests and diseases and keep warm and promote seedlings.

Nanchang, February 26th (reporting). Jiangxi is stepping up its preparations for spring plowing, striving for a bumper harvest of 24 million mu of early rice. Taking Nankang County as an example, as of the 13th of this month, the county's early rice had an average of 861 dan of fertilizer per mu, a double increase compared to last year, and 60% of the fertilizer had been delivered to the fields; water conservancy projects had completed 10 million cubic meters of earthwork, a five-fold increase compared to last year; The county's early rice fields have generally been plowed and harrowed twice, and 2,500 mu of seedling fields have been tidied up. Great achievements have also been made in the preparation of seeds, tools, and other aspects.

In order to make the preparation for plowing work meet the requirements of quantity, quality, and comprehensiveness, inspection teams led by Party committee secretaries at all levels in the province have gone deep into the communes. They eat, live, and work with the commune members, and solve problems immediately when they are discovered. Fuzhou Prefecture has recently generally inspected the water conservancy projects in the entire region, organized rework for individual projects with poor quality; raised the dams that were not high enough, and reinforced the ones that were not compacted enough. During the spring plowing inspection, Ji'an Prefecture found that the shortage of small farm tools was a prominent problem, so the counties immediately organized iron and wood workers to go to the countryside to repair and equip small farm tools, and vigorously develop commune and team farm tool repair and equipment stations. According to statistics, the entire prefecture has now repaired and equipped 700,000 small farm tools and newly made 70,000 pieces. Jiujiang Prefecture has been experiencing prolonged rain recently, which has affected the progress of fertilizer accumulation. The inspection team immediately mobilized the masses to find ways to break through the continuous rain. As a result, many methods of accumulating fertilizer in rainy weather have been created in various places, implementing "doing dry work indoors in heavy rain, and dry work outdoors in light rain," and persisting in accumulating fertilizer even in rainy weather. Under the promotion of the inspection team, the preparation for plowing work has become more detailed and more solid.

    广东·宁夏·江西
    大部地区备耕就绪
    本报广州26日电　广东省备耕工作基本就绪，春耕已提前开始。
  2月6日中共广东省委向全省人民发出“抓住有利形势，鼓起冲天干劲，决心实现1959年粮食生产更大跃进”的响亮号召后，中共各地委、县委、公社党委，都召开了紧急会议，一致热烈响应省委号召，修订今年粮食生产计划，增加增产措施，并连续举行了成千上万的人参加的誓师大会。与此同时，都迅速地按任务按比例，适当压缩其它生产战线的人员，增援早造粮食生产这一主攻战线，使全省粮食生产战线的出勤人员，迅速由过去的六百多万人，增加到一千万人以上（占农村总劳力的60％），最大限度地满足了目前早造粮食生产对劳动力的需要。
    与调集农村劳动大军增援粮食战线的同时，中共广东省各级党委也根据保证粮食元帅紧急升帐的精神，重新配置了干部力量。地委、县委、区党委第一书记都以更大精力抓紧了早造粮食生产，党委书记处增加了管农业的书记。
    到最近为止，备耕已基本胜利完成。二千五百万亩粮食生产的基本农田已具有三个月以上抗旱能力，深翻的土地达到二千八百万亩，早造粮食作物平均每亩已拥有肥料一千一百担左右。目前，从潮汕平原到珠江三角洲，从雷州半岛到粤北山区，到处呈现着开耕繁忙的景象，许多地方人山人海热闹非凡，耙田、送肥、播种、育秧等开耕工作，齐头并进，竞抢春色。3月初全省即可全线进入插秧大忙。（杨伟群）
    本报银川26日电　在“塞上江南”的宁夏回族自治区，已经响起了春耕战斗的号角。
    连日来，占全区劳动力80％以上的回、汉族社员，投入了运肥、撒粪、耕地、耙磨、播种等紧张的春耕春播工作。目前，黄河两岸各县市已普遍开始下种，南部山区也将在“春分”前后播种。
    今年，自治区春耕生产的最大特点是动手早、抓得快、质量高、声势大。由于公社化后，劳力和生产资料在更大范围内得到统一调配和比以前更合理、更有效地使用，在去年秋收刚一结束，各地人民公社就以二十多万精壮劳力紧抓深翻、积肥、水利等，到去年年底，全部夏田耕地已经深翻。今年全区积肥数量比去年增加很多，质量也好。春播前夕，绝大部分公社已把夏田所需肥料送到地里。很多公社实行了基本肥料制度，把人粪尿、猪羊粪等优质肥料，预先送到基本农田里，使每亩基本农田施上好肥三、四十车到五、六十车。去冬以来，山区和川区的一些中、小型水利工程也都坚持了施工，南部干旱山区兴修的十个大、中型水库，大都争取今年能春灌和夏灌。
    为了切实贯彻合理密植，春播前夕，各公社集中了良工巧匠，并以师傅带徒弟的办法，突击赶制和改装了大批密植耧等春播春耕工具，还举办现场会议、训练班，训练了大批摇耧手等春播技术人员，以保证小麦播种既合乎密植要求，又能提高质量。各公社还采用调剂、兑换等办法，提前把小麦良种准备就绪，并全面进行了粒选和药剂拌种、肥料拌种，以消灭病虫害和保温催苗。
    本报南昌26日电　江西各地正在加紧备耕，力争二千四百万亩早稻大丰收。以南康县为例，到本月13日，全县早稻每亩平均有肥八百六十一担，比去年增加一倍，60％的肥料已送到田里；水利工程已完成一千万土方，比去年增加五倍；全县早稻田已普遍做过两犁两耙，并整理好了二千五百亩秧田。种子、工具等方面的准备也已取得很大成绩。
    为了使备耕工作达到多、好、全面的要求，全省由各级党委书记率领的检查团已深入公社，他们与社员同吃同住同劳动，发现问题马上解决。抚州专区近来普遍检查了全区的水利工程，对个别质量差的工程组织了返工；坝不够高的进行了加高，打夯不实的进行了加固。吉安专区在备耕检查中发现小农具不足是个突出问题，各县便立即组织了铁木工人下乡修配小农具，并大力发展社、队农具修配站。据统计，全专区现已修配好小农具七十万件，新制七万件。九江专区近来久雨不晴，影响积肥进度，检查团人员即发动群众想办法突破连雨关。结果，各地创造出了许多雨天积肥办法，实行“大雨屋内干，小雨屋外干”，在雨天仍然坚持了积肥。在检查团的促进下，各地备耕工作做得更加细致更加踏实了。
