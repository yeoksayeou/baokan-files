Initial Display of Great Ambitions
By Our Correspondents Tian Zhuang and Luo Chongzhang

Towards Garden-Style Farming

Leaving the ancient county town of Huangpi (Hubei), you enter the area under the jurisdiction of the Lutai People's Commune. Although this commune has only been established for four months, its life is like a fire that will never be extinguished, burning ever brighter and radiating light.

On a day of rare warmth and sunshine in the cold season, we followed Zhang Chenggen, the first secretary of the commune's Party committee, to the Huancheng Management District. In the vast fields, the thriving and lush wheat, barley, rapeseed...were already a sea of green. In the distance, people were busy applying topdressing fertilizer. Along the highway leading to Hankou, we arrived at a place called Yangjiawan. Here, the old field ridges were no longer visible, and plots of land were arranged very neatly, like green carpets.

We were mesmerized by the scene before us. After inquiring in detail, we learned that in August and September of last year, in order to welcome the establishment of the commune, the commune members launched a vigorous land leveling campaign, connecting the uneven, scattered small plots of land into large, flat areas. Now, the commune has more than 50,000 mu of winter crops, connected into more than 600 large plots, the largest of which is more than 3,000 mu, and the smallest is also several tens of mu. In this way, the commune has basically achieved garden-style farming. The commune members sang happily: "The people's commune has great strength, its advantages are endless, deep plowing and strip sowing are done well, and the crops grow like flowers. Small graves have been moved, the land is connected and roads are wide, there are methods for a bumper harvest next year, and the commune members laugh happily."

After Setting Up a Farm Tool Factory

On the day we visited the farm tool factory, the workers in the machinery workshop were concentrating on installing a large wooden gantry planer. Beside the lathe that had just been bought from Hankou, there were also many people gathered, seemingly studying the lathe's performance. The workers' skillful operation and their expressions made it impossible to tell that they were all farmers only a few months ago! During the visit, they greeted us warmly and introduced us to various self-made wooden lathes and drilling machines. Next to this workshop were the foundry workshop and the carpentry workshop, which were also very busy that day. Dozens of furnaces were rushing to produce a sickle for cutting lake grass; the carpenters were also rushing to produce grass bag machines, wooden rails, slides, wooden horses... for the commune.

In order to understand the development process of this factory and its support for agricultural production, we specially visited Deputy Director Luo Songfu. This man in his forties was the director of an agricultural cooperative a few months ago. He told us that originally, all farm tools, large and small, had to be supplied by the county's farm tool factory, and they had a lot of work to do, so the farm tools sent for repair or custom-made often took several months, sometimes missing the season. This factory was established in August and September of last year. Originally, there were only three furnaces and more than twenty people, but now it has developed into five workshops, namely casting, carpentry, installation, machinery and sand turning, with a total of more than 180 people. In these days, they have produced a large number of deep plows, strip seeders, threshers, fast rice harvesters... for the commune. In October last year, when it was the busy season for harvesting late rice and winter sowing, the labor force was very tight, so the workers used three days and two nights to imitate more than 2,000 fast rice harvesters, and as a result, they reaped more than 50,000 mu of late rice in just nine days, increasing the work efficiency by more than four times compared to the past.

In addition to the farm tool factory, this commune also has factories for fertilizer, cement, etc., which have powerfully promoted agricultural production.

Like Bamboo Shoots After Rain

People often use the phrase "like bamboo shoots after rain" to describe the prosperous scene of emerging industries. After visiting the Lutai Commune, we felt that only these words could reflect the face of industrial development here. Since the establishment of the commune, more than 90 factories have been built in the entire commune in just a few months. One day, we arrived at Wuliangdian Town. On both sides of the small street hung signs: rice mill, rope processing factory, colored paper processing factory, sugar factory, sewing factory... These factories were all built after the communization, among which the rope processing factory alone earned more than 130,000 yuan in more than two months.

The commodity production in Lengdian and Lutai Management Districts aroused our great interest. Here, there are factories for Jianrong blankets, firecrackers, grass bags, toothbrushes, writing brushes, refractory bricks, soy sauce, vermicelli, etc. These products are sold to cities such as Wuhan, Changsha, and Chongqing.

The commune was established for such a short time, how could so many factories be built all of a sudden? We found the answer during the visit. There is such a thing: the people of Wudian Management District had long hoped to have a rice mill, but in the past, the primary cooperatives were small and weak, and later, when the advanced cooperative was built, they scraped together several hundred yuan to buy a machine, but the power and housing problems were still not solved. It was not until the commune was built that the people's wishes were realized. The commune can unify the arrangement of labor force, which is of great benefit to the rapid development of industry. In the Wuliangdian Farm Tool Repair Factory, there is a man named Wu Zhile who used to work as a carpenter in Hankou. After the Japanese invaders occupied Hankou, he stayed at home and engaged in agricultural production until he returned to his favorite position after the establishment of the commune. There are many people like this, and people call this "technical return." The number of people in the entire commune who have "returned to their technical posts" is more than 370, which is truly "making the best use of their talents."

A Land of Fish and Rice

The Lutai Commune is rich in fish production, and the aquaculture farm is located in the famous Ya'er Lake. Unfortunately, the fishing team had already gone fishing in the outer rivers.

The comrades of the aquaculture farm told us that the entire commune has more than 5,000 mu of lakes, and more than 9,000 mu of ponds and weirs. In the years since liberation, although fish production has been higher year by year, there have been many disputes because the lake belonged to several agricultural cooperatives in the past. It is said that there is a large Chong Lake in Wudian Township and Shengli Township. In the autumn of 1957, there was a flood here, and the fish were very abundant. As long as a dike two li long was built in the lake, 300,000 to 400,000 jin of fish could be caught. However, at that time, Chun'guang, Hongguang, Qunjian, Hongchun and other cooperatives disagreed on the distribution issue, and the township held three meetings without solving the problem. As a result, the dike was not built, and the fish ran away.

Now the commune has formed a fishing team including more than 60 boats and more than 300 people. In just over two months after the establishment of the commune, it has caught more than 160,000 jin of fish, exceeding 48% of the total output in the first half of last year. The aquaculture farm is changing the past practice of only catching and not raising. They are preparing to expand the original 60 mu of aquaculture ponds to more than 220 mu, and plan to hatch 450 million fish fry, so that this year's fish production can be increased from 600,000 jin last year to more than 3 million jin.

All of this gave us a strong impression: the people's commune has brought prosperity and is thriving.

    初展鸿图
    本报记者  田庄  罗重璋
    走向园田化
    走出古老的黄陂县城（湖北），便是鲁台人民公社管辖的地方了。这个公社诞生虽然只有四个月，但是，它的生命却像一团永远熄灭不了的火，越烧越旺，光芒四射。
    在一个严寒季节里稀有的风和日暖的日子，我们跟着公社党委第一书记张承根同志到了环城管理区。辽阔的田野里，茁壮而又肥美的小麦、大麦、油菜……已是一片葱绿。远处，追肥的人们正在忙个不停。沿着通往汉口的公路，我们来到了一个叫杨家垸的地方。这里已经看不到昔日的田埂，一畦又一畦的土地排列得十分整齐。就像一条条绿色的地毯一样。
    我们被眼前的景色迷住了。详细一了解，原来，去年8、9月间，社员们为了迎接公社的建立，全社热火朝天地搞开了平整土地的运动，使高低不平的零星的小块土地，连结成了平坦的大片。现在，全社有五万多亩冬季作物，连成了六百多个大片，其中最大的片有三千多亩，小的也有几十亩。这样一来，全社就基本上实现了园田化。社员们这样高兴地唱：“人民公社力量大，优越无穷难说它，深耕条播搞得好，庄稼长得一枝花。小山坟墓搬了家，土地连片大路化，明年丰收有办法，社员快乐笑哈哈。”
    办起农具厂以后
    我们访问农具厂的那天，机械车间的工人们正聚精会神地安装一个庞大的木制龙门刨床。新从汉口买来的车床跟前，也围着好些人，好像是在研究车床的性能似的，工人们操作的熟练和那股神情，根本看不出他们几个月以前还都是庄稼汉哩！参观时，他们一面跟我们热情地打招呼，一面为我们介绍自制的各种木制车床、钻床。紧靠着这个车间的是铸工车间和木工车间，这天也十分忙碌，几十盘烘炉正在赶制一种用来打湖草的镰刀；木工们也正在为社里赶制草包机、木轨、滑梯、木马……。
    为了了解这个厂的发展过程和它对农业生产的支援情况，我们特地访问了副厂长罗松甫。这个四十多岁的人，几个月前是一个农业社主任。他告诉我们，原来这里不管大小农具都得靠县里的农具厂供应，而它们的活路又多，送去修理或订做的农具，常常一拖几个月，有时候就把季节误了。这个厂是去年8、9月间建立的。原先只有三个烘炉，二十多个人，现今已经发展到拥有五个车间，即铸工、木工、安装、机械和翻砂，一共一百八十多人了。在这些日子里，他们为社里生产了大批的深耕犁、条播器、打谷机、快速割禾器……。去年10月间，正是收割晚稻和冬播两头忙的时候，劳动力十分紧张，工人们便用了三天两夜的工夫，仿制了二千多个快速割禾器，结果只九天时间，就把五万多亩晚稻抢收完了，工效比过去提高四倍多。
    这个公社为农业生产服务的除农具厂以外，还有肥料、水泥等厂。这些都有力地促进了农业生产。
    雨后春笋
    人们常用“雨后春笋”这句话来形容新兴事业的繁荣景象。我们参观了鲁台公社以后，感到只有用这几个字才能反映出这里工业发展的面貌。从公社建立以来，仅仅几个月当中，全社就建成了九十多个工厂。一天，我们到了吴良店镇。小街两旁挂着：米厂、绳索加工厂、色纸加工厂、制糖厂、缝纫厂……的牌子。这些厂都是公社化以后建成的，其中仅绳索加工厂在两个多月的时间里，就收入了十三万多元。
    冷店和鲁台管理区的商品生产引起我们很大兴趣。在这里，有建绒、鞭炮、草包、牙刷、毛笔、耐火砖、酱油、粉条等厂，这些产品，行销武汉、长沙、重庆等城市。
    公社建立时间这么短，怎么一下子建立了这么多工厂呢？我们在访问中找到了答案。有这样一件事：吴店管理区的人们老早就盼望有个米厂，但是过去初级社社小力薄，后来，建成了高级社，凑了几百元买了部机器，可是动力、房子还是解决不了，直到公社建成以后，人们的愿望才实现了。公社能统一安排劳动力，这对迅速发展工业有很大好处。在吴良店农具修配厂里，有个叫吴志乐的人，以前在汉口做过木匠活，日寇攻陷汉口后，他就在家里一直搞农业生产，直到公社成立后才又回到自己喜爱的岗位。像这样的人多得很，人们都管这叫做“技术归队”。全社“技术归队”的人数已有三百七十多人，这真是“人尽其才”了。
    鱼米之乡
    鲁台公社鱼产丰富，养殖场就在有名的鸭儿湖。可是，不巧得很，捕鱼队已经到外江捕鱼去了。
    养殖场的同志告诉我们，全社有湖五千多亩，另外还有九千多亩塘堰。解放几年来，虽然鱼产量一年比一年高，但是，由于过去湖是好几个农业社的，所以扯皮的事不少。听说，吴店乡和胜利乡有个面积很大的崇湖，1957年秋季这里发了水，鱼儿非常丰盛，只要在湖里做一条长二华里的堤埂，就可以捕捞三、四十万斤鱼，可是，当时春光、红光、群建、红春等社在分配问题上意见不一致，乡里连开了三次会也没解决，结果堤埂没做成，鱼都跑掉了。
    现在公社组成了一支包括六十多只船、三百多人的捕鱼队，仅公社建立后两个多月时间，已捕鱼十六万多斤，超过去年上半年总产量的48％。养殖场正在改变过去光捕不养的作法，他们准备把过去六十多亩的养殖塘扩大到二百二十多亩，计划孵鱼种四亿五千尾，这样，就可以使今年的鱼产量由去年的六十万斤增加到三百多万斤。
    这一切，给了我们强烈的印象：人民公社带来了繁荣，并且在蒸蒸日上。
