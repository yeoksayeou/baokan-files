　　Hebei Calls on the Province's Communes to Establish a Greater Leap Forward Ideology and Carry Out the "Four Increases and Four Defenses" Movement
　　(Our newspaper, Baoding, February 12th) The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) convened a wheat bumper harvest forum on February 10th to focus on discussing how to strive for a greater bumper harvest of wheat this year. This meeting was presided over by Comrade Zhang Kerang, member of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC and Vice Governor of Hebei Province. Comrade Tan Zhenlin, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, attended the meeting. Participants included leading comrades from the Tianjin Municipal Committee and the Tangshan, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and Handan Prefectural Committees, representatives from the five counties of Anguo, Gaocheng, Yongnian, Ningjin, and Leting, which initiated the province-wide red flag competition for wheat bumper harvests, and representatives from counties such as Zhengding, Dingxian, Xushui, and Tangxian. There were also more than 30 representatives from some people's communes and production teams.
　　After discussion, the comrades present unanimously recognized that to realize a greater leap forward in agriculture this year, it is first necessary to strive for a greater leap forward in wheat. To achieve a greater leap forward in wheat, it is necessary to further establish a leap forward ideology, formulate advanced wheat production increase targets and measures, and muster greater enthusiasm. Every effort that can be made must be made, and right-leaning conservative thinking must be prevented. After analyzing the favorable situation of wheat growth due to deep plowing, close planting, and strengthened winter management last year, everyone's confidence in striving for a greater leap forward was greatly increased. They put forward the battle cry of resolutely seizing a bumper harvest of wheat and striving to make one season equal one year. In order to realize this battle cry, it was proposed to seize every moment, grasp the key periods of greening-up, jointing, heading, and flowering, and continuously launch several large-scale high tides of wheat field management, allowing wheat to pass several hurdles well. Currently, it is necessary to concentrate efforts to allow wheat to pass the greening-up hurdle well, laying the foundation for increasing seedlings, increasing spikes, and increasing grains. In order to pass the greening-up hurdle well, everyone studied several key measures, including harrowing and rolling the land, timely and reasonable irrigation and fertilization, etc., as well as the leadership of people's communes and production teams in striving for a greater leap forward in wheat. According to the requirements put forward by the meeting, the comrades present put forward a proposal to the wheat management professional teams of various communes to strengthen wheat field management and pass the greening-up hurdle well. The full text is as follows:

　　We, the representatives attending the wheat bumper harvest forum, have fully discussed the issue of striving for a greater bumper harvest of wheat this year. Everyone further realized that in the decisive year of the three years of hard struggle, we must strive for a greater leap forward in agricultural production. To realize a greater leap forward in agricultural production, we must first do everything possible to seize a bumper harvest of wheat, strive to make one season equal one year, create a high tide, and grasp the management of greening-up. Through four months of hard and clever work, we vow to plant the red flag of high-yield wheat all over the province. This will provide a reliable guarantee for a greater leap forward in agricultural production throughout the year, and will also be of greater significance for accelerating the transformation of agriculture, improving people's lives, consolidating the people's commune system, and gradually promoting the "three-three system" in the farming system.
　　There are sufficient objective possibilities for realizing a greater bumper harvest of wheat this year. Last year, all parts of the province created experiences in high-yield wheat bumper harvests; last autumn, wheat was well planted with a strong foundation, generally after deep plowing and close planting. Fertilizer and water conservancy conditions were relatively good, and winter wheat management was relatively tight. Therefore, wheat fields are generally growing better than last year. In the plains, mountainous areas, and low-lying areas, the wheat fields have full seedlings, many seedlings, and strong seedlings. First-class wheat generally accounts for more than 50%, with about one million seedlings per mu (Chinese unit of area, approximately 667 square meters), more than three tillers per plant, and roots that are deep and strong. Third-class seedlings only account for about 10% of all wheat fields, and the number of such seedlings is also more than 400,000. Under this favorable situation, we need to muster greater enthusiasm, work hard, practically, and cleverly. It is entirely possible to realize a greater bumper harvest of wheat.
　　Now, with the warmth of spring and the blossoming of flowers, wheat is greening-up, which is a critical period for realizing a greater bumper harvest of wheat. At this time, we put forward a proposal to the people's communes and wheat management professional teams in all wheat-producing areas of the province to strive to realize a greater bumper harvest of wheat. We require that each mu of high-yield fields should guarantee 1.5 million to 2 million seedlings, of which 1 million to 1.5 million seedlings should bear spikes, with each spike being 16 mazes (a descriptive unit), each maze hooking 3 or 4 times, and each spike bearing 40 to 50 grains, and the grains should be full. General wheat fields should have 1 million to 1.5 million seedlings, of which 700,000 to 1 million seedlings should bear spikes, with each spike being 14 mazes long, each maze hooking more than 3 times, and each spike bearing 30 to 35 grains. We must make first-class wheat catch up with high yields, second-class wheat catch up with first-class wheat, and third-class wheat catch up with second-class wheat, and resolutely eliminate third-class wheat. We must make every effort to achieve this proposal.
　　To meet the requirements put forward in this proposal, we believe that we should resolutely carry out a "Four Increases and Four Defenses" movement to increase seedlings, increase spikes, increase grains, increase weight, and prevent diseases, prevent pests, prevent lodging, and prevent freezing. Wheat must continuously pass several hurdles well. The weather was warmer last winter, and wheat seedlings are generally greening-up earlier this spring. Therefore, we must first grasp the wheat greening-up hurdle to promote more tillering, increase wheat mazes, and grow large spikes, laying the foundation for increasing grains and increasing weight. In order to make wheat pass this hurdle well, we should immediately take action and diligently and carefully take the following measures:
　　1.　Harrow and roll the wheat fields in a timely manner to loosen the topsoil, fill cracks, increase soil temperature, preserve soil moisture, and promote wheat tillering. In particular, wheat fields have generally been deeply plowed and are prone to collapse and crack, making topsoil harrowing and rolling even more necessary. Sandy land should be rolled once, and black soil should be harrowed once. Wheat fields that cannot be harrowed or rolled should also be loosened by hoeing or raking. Before harrowing the fields, general wheat fields should be hoeed three times, and high-yield fields should be hoeed even more.
　　2.　Water the greening-up water well. There was less rain and snow last winter, the seedlings are dense and require a large amount of water, and wheat tillering and spikelet differentiation require a lot of water. We must fully supply water to the wheat fields. Therefore, we must water the greening-up water early this year, watering once before and once after the wheat seedlings green-up. Waterlogged wheat fields should be drained, and alkaline wheat fields should be washed and suppressed with alkali. To ensure water for wheat fields, we should immediately launch a high tide of large-scale farmland water conservancy construction, make full use of existing water sources, actively develop new water sources, and realize the water conservancy of wheat fields.
　　3.　Apply topdressing fertilizer in a timely manner. This year, wheat seedlings are generally denser, and some wheat fields do not have enough base fertilizer. To ensure that wheat seedlings grow strong, we must apply more high-quality fine fertilizer. During the greening-up period, high-yield wheat fields should be supplemented with phosphorus and potassium fertilizer in addition to quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer to prevent wheat seedling lodging. For third-class wheat, some nitrogen fertilizer should be applied preferentially. General wheat fields should apply more than 500 jin (Chinese unit of weight, approximately 0.5 kilograms) of local chemical fertilizer per mu, and high-yield fields should apply more than 1,000 jin of local chemical fertilizer per mu. In order to ensure sufficient fertilizer, communes and teams should build local chemical fertilizer plants and produce large quantities of local chemical fertilizer and bacterial fertilizer.
　　4.　Prevent and control pests and diseases to ensure a bumper harvest. We must strengthen the prediction and forecasting of various wheat disasters and actively prevent and control them. In particular, we must pay attention to preventing jaundice. Start strengthening inspections now, treating a piece when you find one plant, and treating a block when you find one piece, and resolutely prevent jaundice from harming production.

　　Passing the greening-up hurdle well will lay a good foundation for increasing spikes, and we must immediately pass the jointing hurdle well. During the wheat jointing period, the wheat is pregnant, which is a critical period for determining the increase in wheat mazes and grains, and it is also a critical period for preventing jaundice and preventing lodging. To pass this hurdle well, we must generally apply phosphorus and potassium fertilizer once or twice, and weak seedlings should continue to apply some nitrogen fertilizer. Before jointing, we must hoe more to preserve soil moisture. To make the wheat seedlings strong, we must squat the seedlings in the early stage of jointing. If the soil is moist and there is sufficient moisture, watering can be appropriately delayed. From jointing to booting, we should appropriately water heavily to ensure sufficient moisture.
　　During the wheat heading, flowering, and grain filling period, it is a critical period for determining the number of hooks and the weight of the grains. At this time, we must promote foliar spraying of phosphorus and water frequently and carefully to ensure water supply. To ensure a wheat harvest, to realize the above requirements for water, fertilizer, protection, and management, we must carry out tool reform on a large scale, create and promote various improved tools, such as irrigation tools, management tools suitable for close planting, land preparation tools, and pest and disease prevention tools. It is particularly important to vigorously prepare wheat harvesting and threshing tools.
　　To manage wheat well, each commune, management area, and wheat management professional team should establish a wheat intelligence network at all levels, observe and record at fixed points, and analyze in combination with large-scale observations. The content includes fertilization, watering, pest control, and changes in seedlings. Report once a week level by level so that leaders and managers are aware of the situation so that they can do a good job in wheat management according to the situation and create bumper harvest experiences.
　　The greening-up period has now arrived. All management measures during the greening-up period should be acted upon immediately. Each commune and professional team should classify and rank wheat fields block by block and manage them block by block, and widely carry out red flag competitions, inspect and compare each other, and set off a high tide of wheat field management, ensuring that all management measures are implemented and realizing a greater bumper harvest of wheat.

    苦干巧干四个月力争一季顶一年
    抓紧时机  管好麦田  确保丰收
    河北号召全省公社树立更大跃进思想开展四增四防运动
    本报保定12日电　2月10日，中共河北省委召开了小麦丰产座谈会，集中地讨论了如何争取今年小麦更大丰收的问题。这次会议，由中共河北省委委员、河北省副省长张克让同志主持。中共中央政治局委员、书记处书记谭震林同志参加了这次会议。参加这次会议的，有天津市委和唐山、保定、石家庄、邯郸地委的负责同志，有发起全省小麦大丰收红旗竞赛的安国、藁城、永年、宁津、乐亭等五个县的代表和正定、定县、徐水、唐县等县的代表。还有部分人民公社和生产队的代表共三十多人。
    到会同志经过讨论一致认识到，要实现今年农业更大跃进，首先要争取小麦有一个更大的跃进，要使小麦有更大的跃进，必须进一步地树立起跃进的思想，制订先进的小麦增产指标和措施，要鼓起更大的干劲，经过一切努力能办到的就一定要办到，防止可能发生的右倾保守思想。大家在分析了由于去年麦田经过深翻、密植，加强了越冬管理，小麦生长良好的有利形势，争取更大跃进的信心倍增，提出坚决夺取小麦大丰收，力争一季顶一年的战斗口号。为了实现这个战斗口号，提出要日晌必争，抓住返青、拔节、出穗、扬花等关键时期，连续掀起几次声势浩大的麦田管理高潮，让小麦过好几道关，在目前说来，要集中力量让小麦过好返青关，为增株增穗增粒打下基础。为了过好返青关，大家研究出了几项关键性的措施，其中包括耙、轧土地，及时合理灌水、施肥等等，以及人民公社和生产队对争取小麦更大跃进的领导问题。到会同志根据会议提出的要求，向各公社小麦管理专业队提出了加强麦田管理过好返青关的一项建议。全文如下：
    我们参加小麦丰产座谈会的代表，充分地讨论了争取今年小麦更大丰收的问题，大家进一步认识到在苦战三年具有决定意义的一年中，在农业生产上必须争取有一个更大的跃进。要实现农业生产的更大跃进，首先要千方百计地夺取小麦大丰收，力争一季顶一年，闹高潮，抓返青的管理，苦干、巧干四个月，誓把小麦高产红旗插遍全省。这样就可使全年农业生产更大跃进有可靠的保证，而且对于加速改变农业面貌，提高人民生活，巩固人民公社制度以及逐步地推行耕作制度上的“三三制”都有更大的意义。
    实现今年小麦更大丰收有充分的客观可能性。去年全省各地都创造了小麦高额丰产的经验；去年秋季小麦种的好，底子强，一般都经过深翻密植，肥料、水利条件都比较好，小麦越冬管理都抓得比较紧。因此麦田普遍比去年长得好，平原、山区及低洼地区的麦田，都是苗全、苗多、苗旺，一类麦一般占50％以上，每亩株数在一百万株左右，单株分蘖三个以上，根子扎得又深又壮，三类苗仅占全部麦田的10％左右，这类麦株数也在四十万株以上。在这种有利形势下，需要我们鼓足更大干劲，苦干、实干、巧干，实现小麦的更大丰收是完全有可能的。
    现在，春暖花开，小麦返青，正在实现小麦更大丰收的关键时期。在这个时候，我们向全省各产麦区的人民公社、小麦管理专业队提出力争实现小麦更大丰收的一项建议，要求小麦丰产方每亩应当保证有一百五十万到二百万株，其中有一百万到一百五十万株结穗，每穗长十六个码子、每个码勾三勾四，每穗结四十到五十个粒，并要籽粒饱满；一般麦田要有一百万到一百五十万株，其中有七十到一百万株结穗，每穗长十四个码子，每个码勾三以上，每穗结三十到三十五个粒。要使一类麦赶高产，二类麦赶一类麦，三类麦赶二类麦，坚决消灭三类麦。这项建议，我们要尽一切努力地做到。
    要达到这项建议中提出的要求，我们认为应当坚决地开展一个增株、增穗、增粒、增重和防病、防虫、防倒、防冻的四增四防运动，要小麦连续地过好几道关。去冬气候较暖，今春麦苗普遍返青早，因此在目前首先要抓紧小麦返青关，促使小麦多分蘖，增麦码，长大穗，给增粒、增重打下基础。为使小麦过好这一关，应立即行动起来，认真勤快细致地采取以下措施。
    一、及时地耙轧、锄耧麦田，使表土疏松、弥补裂缝，提高地温、保好墒土，促使小麦分蘖，特别是麦田大都经过深翻容易塌陷裂缝，顶凌耙轧麦田更为必要。沙地要普轧一遍，黑土地要普耙一遍，不能耙轧的麦田，也要经过锄耧划等办法，使表土疏松。在耙田前一般麦田要锄三遍，丰产方还要多锄。
    二、浇好返青水。去冬雨雪较少，苗密需水量大，加以小麦分蘖、小穗分化需水多，要充分供应麦田水分，因此今年要早浇返青水，在麦苗返青前后各浇一次。积水的麦田要排水，碱地麦田要洗碱压碱。为保证麦田用水，应立即掀起大搞农田水利高潮，充分利用现有水源，积极开辟新水源，实现麦田水利化。
    三、要及时追返青肥。今年麦苗一般较密，有的麦田施底肥不足，为保证麦苗生长粗壮，要多施质量高的细肥，在返青期间丰产方麦田除施速效氮肥外要多配合施磷钾肥，预防麦苗倒伏，对三类麦要偏施些氮肥。一般麦田要施土化肥五百斤以上，丰产田亩施土化肥一千斤以上。为了保证有足够的肥料，社社、队队要建土化肥厂，大量地生产土化肥、细菌肥。
    四、防除虫病害确保大丰收。对小麦各种灾害要加强预测预报，主动防治，特别要注意防止黄疸病，从现在开始就加强检查，发现一棵治一片，发现一片治一块，坚决不让黄疸为害减产。
    过好返青关，就给增穗打下了好基础，还要紧接着过好拔节关。小麦拔节期麦子要怀胎，这是决定小麦增码、增粒的关键时期，也是防黄疸病和防倒伏的关键时期。为过好这一关，要普施磷钾肥一、二次，弱苗还要继续施些氮肥，拔节前要多锄保墒，为使麦苗粗壮，在拔节初期要进行墩苗，若土墒水分充足，可适当推迟浇水。拔节到孕穗应适当浇大水，保证水分充足。
    在小麦抽穗、扬花灌浆期，是决定勾多粒重的关键时期。这时要推行根外喷磷，并要勤浇水细浇水，保证水分供应。为保证小麦丰收，实现以上水、肥、保、管各项措施的要求，必须大搞工具改革，创造和推广各种改良工具，比如灌溉工具，适应密植的管理工具、整地工具、除虫防病的工具，特别重要的是大力准备小麦收割和脱粒工具。
    为把小麦管好，各公社、管理区、小麦管理专业队，层层建立小麦情报网，定点观察记载，结合大面观察进行分析，内容包括施肥、浇水、除虫及苗子变化等情况。每周逐级上报一次，使领导和管理人员做到心中有数，以便根据情况搞好小麦管理，并创造丰收经验。
    目前返青期已到，返青期的一切管理措施都应立即行动起来，各公社和专业队应对麦田逐块分类排队，逐块分类管理并广泛开展红旗竞赛，互相检查评比，掀起一浪高一浪的麦田管理高潮，保证各项管理措施落实，实现小麦更大丰收。
