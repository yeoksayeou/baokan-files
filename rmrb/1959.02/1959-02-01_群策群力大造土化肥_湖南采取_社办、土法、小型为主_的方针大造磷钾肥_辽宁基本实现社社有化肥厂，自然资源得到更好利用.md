From Changsha, this newspaper reported on the 31st: The widespread use of native methods to produce chemical fertilizers by the masses marks a new development in Hunan Province's work of accumulating and producing fertilizer this year. According to recent statistics, the province has established over 30,000 native chemical fertilizer plants and over 50,000 native blast furnaces, producing over 1.82 million tons of various native chemical fertilizers, of which potassium-calcium mixed fertilizer and phosphate fertilizer account for approximately 280,000 tons. Currently, out of the province's 1,100+ people's communes, 879 have established native chemical fertilizer plants and begun producing phosphate and potash fertilizers using native methods. In carrying out the production of native chemical fertilizers centered on potash and phosphate fertilizers, the province has cultivated a batch of technical personnel who have basically mastered the knowledge of identifying ores, mixing ingredients, and calcining in native chemical fertilizer production. Recently, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions requiring all localities to comprehensively rectify and consolidate the production of native chemical fertilizers, further break through the technical barriers of native chemical fertilizers, and improve the quality of native chemical fertilizer production. The province has initially determined 30 counties with abundant mineral resources and relatively well-developed native chemical fertilizer production as base counties for the production of native chemical fertilizers, and fixed 100,000 people for year-round production.

Last October, based on the characteristics of the province's red soil, which is deficient in phosphorus and potassium fertilizers, the Provincial Party Committee issued instructions on vigorously producing phosphate and potash fertilizers. Consequently, all localities adopted the principle of "commune-run, native methods, and small-scale as the mainstay," and the method of "taking local materials, producing locally, and using locally," conducting pilot projects at each level, and carrying out mass-based native chemical fertilizer production from point to area.

Practice has proven that small factories can completely manufacture native chemical fertilizers and even produce high-quality phosphate fertilizers with a phosphorus pentoxide content of over 10%. The key lies in strengthening the Party's leadership, implementing politics in command, boldly mobilizing the masses, and, through airing views, contending, and debating, greatly breaking the "mysterious" concepts in production and various right-leaning conservative ideas that "stones (referring to ores) cannot be burned into fertilizer," and establishing a communist new style of daring to think and act. In Hengyang Prefecture, the county Party secretaries in charge of agriculture took the lead, and in December of last year, they also formed specialized institutions to lead native chemical fertilizer production. At the same time, leading cadres at all levels went deep into factories, set up 19 key fertilizer plants, established over 1,000 experimental furnaces, and worked with the masses to learn, do, improve, and promote, creating a mass movement of vigorously creating native chemical fertilizers with approximately 100,000 people participating in the entire area.

Boldly mobilizing the masses to find raw materials is also an important link. All localities in the province conducted mass-based movements to go up the mountains to find mines and treasures through specimen exhibitions, on-site meetings, and other methods, discovering that more than 50 counties in the province have potassium feldspar and more than 30 counties have phosphate mines, breaking the saying of "no minerals." In order to help all localities identify and test the content of ores and correctly mix ingredients, relevant departments in Hunan Province helped all localities train hundreds of laboratory personnel. The counties in Xiangtan Prefecture organized the laboratory personnel from hospitals, factories, schools, and other departments to regularly go to the people's communes to guide the inspection of ore work, which also played a significant role. In order to solve the problem of insufficient coking coal in phosphate fertilizer refining, the Dongfeng People's Commune in Yuanling County also created the successful experience of using bituminous coal to refine phosphate fertilizer.

Breaking through technical barriers is the central issue in improving the quality of native chemical fertilizers. The technical barriers to manufacturing potash and phosphate fertilizers mainly include five major barriers: finding mines, building furnaces, crushing, mixing ingredients, and calcining. Relying on the collective wisdom and soaring enthusiasm of the masses, all localities have basically broken through the "five barriers" and produced batches of potash and phosphate fertilizers. Recently, relevant provincial units organized more than 30 technical cadres into seven working groups, which went to various localities twice to help solve technical problems in fertilizer production, such as ore crushing, furnace bottom caking, and non-flow.

In order to use less manpower while producing more and better native chemical fertilizers in the case of insufficient labor, Shaoyang County adopted the "six fixes" method of fixing people, furnaces, tasks, quality, time, and operating procedures, which increased the production efficiency of native chemical fertilizers by five times compared to the original. Many places have greatly increased work efficiency by vigorously carrying out tool reforms in the production of native chemical fertilizers.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 31st: Liaoning Province is producing large quantities of native fertilizers. The 7,500 native fertilizer plants in normal production across the province have already produced 1.9 billion catties of various native fertilizers.

Liaoning Province is rich in native fertilizer resources and has great potential. Fourteen cities and counties in the west and south are coastal, with a coastline of more than 3,000 li. The variety of marine fertilizers that can be used as raw materials for native fertilizers is abundant, inexhaustible, and inexhaustible. The peat moss deposits in the northern and eastern counties are even more abundant, and there is also potassium feldspar in the mountainous areas. In order to fully utilize these resources and create native chemical fertilizers, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site meeting on native chemical fertilizers and native pesticides in Fuxian County last August, promoting the advanced experience of manufacturing native chemical fertilizers and native pesticides. Since then, the production of native chemical fertilizers has developed rapidly. The counties broke through the mysterious view of manufacturing native chemical fertilizers with the mass work method of "don't believe it, just look, and do it when you understand it." The Liaoyang area held a native chemical fertilizer exhibition and organized thousands of people to visit and learn, which greatly boosted the masses' confidence in manufacturing native chemical fertilizers. Now, the province has basically achieved the goal of every commune having a native chemical fertilizer plant.

Various localities are constantly improving technology, improving the quality of native chemical fertilizers, and increasing the variety of products. The counties in the plains have used nitre soil (soil from the base of walls) to manufacture large quantities of potassium nitrate. The counties in the mountainous areas have vigorously mined potassium feldspar, magnesite, and iron pyrite, and used potassium feldspar to produce calcium-potassium fertilizers. The coastal counties are widely using sea bittern to manufacture potassium chloride and potassium-magnesium fertilizers. The hydromagnesite fertilizers manufactured by Haicheng and Yingkou counties with magnesite are of very good quality. The people's communes in Zhuanghe County have reformed the flue to recover ammonia water from it and used waste smoke to make high-efficiency fertilizers.

The various scientific research departments in Liaoning Province also strongly support and assist the production of native chemical fertilizers. In order to identify varieties in a timely manner, the Liaoning Provincial Science and Technology Commission and the Chemical Industry Bureau organized scientific research institutions, universities, and chemical plants throughout the province to contract for the testing of native chemical fertilizers in various places by region. The Dalian Chemical Industry Bureau not only tests samples for rural areas free of charge but also organizes technicians to go to various native chemical fertilizer plants to provide guidance and train laboratory technicians for the people's communes in various counties. Teachers and students from Shenyang Agricultural College recently conducted surveys in 12 coastal cities and counties, including Andong, Jin County, Xingcheng, and Jin County, and discovered more than 60 kinds of marine fertilizers with high fertilizer efficiency and high utilization value. They have compiled the collected varieties and manufacturing methods into a book, which has further promoted the production of native chemical fertilizers in coastal areas. (Attached picture)

    群策群力大造土化肥
    湖南采取“社办、土法、小型为主”的方针大造磷钾肥
    辽宁基本实现社社有化肥厂，自然资源得到更好利用
    本报长沙31日电　群众普遍运用土法制造化学肥料，是今年湖南省积肥、造肥工作上一个新的发展。据最近统计，全省已建立土化肥厂三万多个，土高炉五万多个，已生产各种土化肥一百八十二万多吨，其中钾钙混合肥和磷肥约占二十八万多吨。现在，全省一千一百多个人民公社中，已有八百七十九个公社建立了土化肥厂，开始以土法生产磷钾化肥。在开展以造磷钾肥为中心的土化肥生产中，全省已培养了一批技术力量，他们基本上掌握鉴别矿石、配料、煅烧等土化肥生产知识。最近中共湖南省委发出指示，要求各地全面整顿、巩固土化肥的生产工作，进一步突破土化肥技术关，提高土化肥制造质量。全省初步确定矿石资源丰富、目前土化肥生产开展较好的三十个县为生产土化肥的基点县，并固定十万人常年生产。
    去年10月，省委根据全省红壤多，缺磷钾肥的特点，发出关于大力生产磷钾化肥的指示，于是各地采取了以“社办、土法、小型为主”的方针，和“就地取材、就地生产、就地使用”的办法，层层试点，由点到面地开展群众性的土化肥生产。
    实践证明：用小厂完全可以制造土化肥，而且还能生产出含五氧化二磷10％以上的优质磷肥。关键在于加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，放手发动群众，通过鸣放辩论，大破生产中的“神秘”观念和认为“石头（指矿石）烧不成肥料”的各种右倾保守思想，树立敢想敢为的共产主义新风格。衡阳专区各县由管农业的书记挂帅，去年12月间还组成了专门领导土化肥生产的机构；同时，各级领导干部深入工厂，搞了十九个重点化肥厂，建立一千多个试验炉，和群众一道边学、边做、边改进、边推广，在全区造成一个约有十多万人参加的大造土化肥运动。
    放手发动群众找原料，也是重要的一环。全省各地通过标本展览会、现场会等办法，开展群众性的上山寻矿探宝运动，发现全省五十多县有钾长石，三十多个县有磷矿，打破了“无矿论”的说法。为了帮助各地鉴定化验矿石的含量，正确地进行配料，湖南省有关部门帮助各地训练了上百名化验人员。湘潭专区各县把医院、工厂、学校等部门的化验人员组织起来，定期到各人民公社指导检验矿石工作，也起了很大作用。为了解决炼磷肥中的焦煤不足问题，沅陵县东风人民公社还创造了烟煤炼磷肥的成功经验。
    突破技术关是提高土化肥质量的中心问题。制造磷钾化肥的技术关主要有找矿、建炉、粉碎、配料、煅烧等五大关。各地依靠群众的集体智慧和冲天干劲，基本上突破了“五关”，制成了成批的磷钾肥。最近省级有关单位又组织三十多名技术干部，分成七个工作组，先后两次到各地帮助解决化肥生产中的碎矿和炉底板结、不流等技术问题。
    为了在劳力不足的情况下，做到少用人力，而又能生产出更多更好的土化肥，邵阳县采取定人、定炉、定任务、定质量、定时间、定操作规程的“六定”办法，土化肥生产效率较原来提高五倍。许多地方在土化肥生产中大闹工具改革，也大大提高了工效。

    新华社沈阳31日电　辽宁省各地大量制造土化肥。全省正常生产的七千五百个土化肥厂，已经生产出各种土化肥十九亿斤。
    辽宁省土化肥资源丰富，潜力很大。西部、南部有十四个市县沿海，海岸线长达三千多里，可作土化肥原料的海肥种类繁多，取之不尽，用之不竭。北部、东部各县，草炭埋藏量更为丰富，山区还有钾长石。为了充分利用这些资源，大造土化肥，去年8月中共辽宁省委在复县召开了土化肥、土农药现场会议，推广了制造土化肥、土农药的先进经验。从那以后，土化肥生产有了较迅速的发展。各县以“不信就看、通了就干”的群众工作方法，冲破了制造土化肥的神秘观点。辽阳地区举办了土化肥展览会，组织了几千人参观学习，大大地鼓舞了群众制造土化肥的信心。现在，全省已经基本上实现了社社有土化肥厂。
    各地正在不断地改进技术，提高土化肥的质量和增多品种。平原各县利用硝土（墙根土）大量制造了硝酸钾。山区各县大力开采钾长石、菱镁石和硫化铁矿，用钾长石生产了钙钾肥料。沿海各县正在广泛利用海卤制造氯化钾、钾镁肥料。海城、营口两县用菱镁石制造的氢镁肥料，质量很好。庄河县各人民公社，改修烟道，从中回收氨水，利用废烟制成了高效肥料。
    辽宁省各个科学研究部门，也都大力支持和辅导土化肥的生产。为了及时鉴定品种，辽宁省科学技术委员会和化工局组织全省科学研究机构、大专学校和化工厂，分片包干各地土化肥的化验工作。旅大市化工局不仅无代价地为农村化验样品，并且组织技术人员到各地土化肥厂巡回指导，为各县人民公社培训化验员。沈阳农学院师生最近到安东、金县、兴城、锦县等沿海十二个市县调查，发现了六十多种肥效高、利用价值大的海肥。他们已把采集的品种和制造办法编印成册，这就更加促进了沿海地区土化肥的生产。（附图片）
