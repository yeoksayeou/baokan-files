Strive to Climb the Peak of Cultural and Scientific Achievement
Su Jian, Director of the Political Department of a certain division of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

Before joining the revolution, my education was limited to the first year of junior high school. From joining the revolution until 1949, I spent a long time in marches and battles, only learning from practical work, and my results were very poor.

	The Situation Compels Us: A Quick Catch-Up
In the summer of 1949, after the troops entered the city, I studied the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao's "On People's Democratic Dictatorship," which profoundly educated me. The resolutions of the Second Plenary Session and Chairman Mao's article both pointed out that, due to the development of the revolutionary situation, some of the things we were familiar with in the past were about to become idle, while the things we were not familiar with were forcing us to do, and we must learn what we did not understand. I also saw with my own eyes that with the rapid development of the country's industry, agriculture, and other undertakings, the army's technical equipment was continuously improved, modern arms of service were established one after another, and new technical weapons were increasing day by day. Faced with these large numbers of new things, I felt that I understood less and less, so I felt compelled by the situation and had to study hard.
In 1952, the entire army began modern training. The General Political Department further pointed out the importance of rapidly improving the cultural level of the troops and cultivating a large number of worker-peasant intellectuals for the modernization of the army. At this time, I had been transferred to work in the division. Every day, I had to read and approve many materials, and sometimes I had to write things myself. However, due to the limitations of my cultural level, my efficiency was low, and I felt strained. The things I wrote were often unsatisfactory even to myself. This made me increasingly feel that there was only one path in front of me: catch up quickly and keep up with the situation.
With the determination made, the question that followed was where to start learning? Should I learn whatever I see in a general way? Or should I study systematically and with a plan? After repeated consideration, I felt that revolutionary work was a long-term endeavor, and I should start from the beginning and adhere to systematic and planned study from a long-term perspective. In the more than seven years from the winter of 1951 to the present, in terms of cultural knowledge, I reviewed high elementary school arithmetic, and studied junior and senior high school algebra, plane geometry, plane trigonometry, solid geometry, physics, chemistry, and the basics of Darwinism. In addition, I also studied grammar, rhetoric, speech, formal logic, and preliminary higher mathematics courses, and read classical works such as "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Dream of the Red Chamber," and "Water Margin." In terms of political theory, I repeatedly studied the capitalist part of political economy, "On the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship" , "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," the socialist education curriculum (minimum part), and "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." In terms of military technology knowledge, along with the training progress of the troops, I used opportunities such as participating in teaching method training and going down to the troops to gain a superficial understanding of the technology and tactics of infantry, artillery, armored, communications and other arms of service, and mastered preliminary operation skills, such as driving cars and tanks, and using radios.

	Cultural Improvement: Countless Benefits
Seven years of continuous study have made me deeply feel that cultural and scientific knowledge is of great help to the study of political theory. Taking the study of military technology as an example, because I have mastered preliminary cultural and scientific knowledge, it is relatively easy to learn many technical weapons. Once the instructor points it out, I can understand it. For example, why does light bullet travels far and heavy bullet travels short when shooting? I can understand that this is caused by the earth's gravity and the law of inertia that objects in motion remain in motion, and objects at rest remain at rest. The working principle of the full-speed regulator of a tank engine is relatively difficult to understand. From its structure, I can find an explanation from the basic principles of centrifugal force and centripetal force in mechanics. For example, in the technical revolution, I found that Shao Jiqing, the company commander of a self-propelled artillery battalion in a certain regiment, invented a shooting mil conversion table. After reading it, I knew that it was made according to the logarithmic principle, so I could appraise it and affirm its value.
After mastering certain cultural and scientific knowledge and theoretical knowledge through study, my horizons have broadened and my thinking has opened up, which has direct guiding significance and influence on my work. For a long time after I joined the revolution, I relied on enthusiasm and experience to carry out my work to a certain extent. Some of my work was unstable and inaccurate. Often, after the work was completed, it was either right or wrong, and I could not find the experience of success or failure relatively quickly and accurately, and rise to a certain height. After studying, my work in recent years has been better, and I have a little understanding in my heart.

	Arranging Time: Resolving Contradictions
In adhering to self-study, in addition to the leadership of the Party, the encouragement of superiors, and the help of comrades, effectively resolving the contradiction between work and study is a decisive issue. In-service self-study, work and study are always contradictory. The center of the contradiction is the time problem. As long as we seriously analyze and deal with it, this contradiction can be resolved. My experience is that first of all, we must strengthen the organization and planning of work, and try to complete today's work today. If the work is arranged well, there will be time for study. At the same time, our work is sometimes in the office and sometimes in the troops. It is impossible to have a quiet environment. We must also study wherever we go. Even if we have ten minutes, we must strive to do an exercise and read a paragraph of a book. In short, practice has proved that as long as we cultivate the habit of loving to read and study, and regard study as important as work, eating, and sleeping, we can become the master of time, eliminate the worry of not having time, and use all possible spare time to study.

	Correcting Attitude: Taking Everyone as a Teacher
It is also very important to correct our attitude towards learning, take everyone as a teacher, and overcome learning difficulties. Chairman Mao taught us: "The question of knowledge is a scientific question, and there can be no hypocrisy or pride. What is absolutely needed is the opposite—an attitude of honesty and humility." He also said: We must "learn respectfully and honestly. If we don't understand, we don't understand, don't pretend to understand." All these tell us that to learn something, we must work hard honestly. I have encountered many difficulties in my long-term self-study, and these words have given me great encouragement and strength. In order to study, we must put down our airs, act as students with the status of ordinary workers, and take everyone as a teacher. For textbook learning, many comrades in the office are my lecturers. When integrating theory with practice, the technical weapons, equipment, and teaching aids in the sub-units are all learning tools, and the technical officers, technicians, electricians, repairmen, drivers, and drivers are all my teachers. Whenever I come into contact with them, I learn from them. When the courses are more difficult, I ask middle school teachers to be my teachers to explain the difficult points, and I go to the laboratory to see models or do experiments. In short, as long as someone has strengths, they are my teachers. I visit them and am not ashamed to ask questions, letting them impart knowledge. At the same time, in the process of learning, I constantly fight against the laziness that arises in my mind, so that I can persevere. This emotion comes from two aspects: The first is that because I am busy with work, I am more mentally tired after a day's work, and the burden on my energy is too heavy. In addition, learning is often interrupted by phone calls or visitors, and I often have the idea of not wanting to learn; the second is that self-study constantly encounters difficulties, such as not being able to solve the exercises when studying the application of Newton's binomial theorem of polynomials and inverse trigonometric functions, which leads to impatience. Whenever I encounter these problems, I try to overcome myself, calm down, walk from this room to that room, look at Marx's famous sayings on the wall, the words spoken by Gorky and Ostrovsky, and think about the teachings of the Party, and then I cheer up again. Marx's famous saying: There is no smooth road in science, only those who climb tirelessly and fearlessly have hope of climbing to the glorious peak. It is my motto in learning and gives me the courage and strength to overcome difficulties.
To persist in in-service self-study, we must both work and study. It is impossible without abundant energy and a healthy body. Therefore, I go to bed on time and get up on time every day. After getting up, I run in the wild for 20 minutes, play basketball every day in spring, summer and autumn, and engage in production labor such as growing vegetables. In short, I engage in some physical activities every day, so that my brain nerves and my whole body can be properly adjusted, which is of great benefit to both work and study.
Over the past few years, I have persisted in self-study and have made some progress compared to the past, but measured by the requirements of the Party, I am still not doing enough. In the future, I am determined to do a better job in learning under the leadership of the Party and strive to make great strides forward!

    努力攀登文化科学高峰  
    中国人民解放军某师政治部主任　苏鉴
    我在参加革命前，只有初中一年的文化程度。从参加革命到1949年这段较长的时间里，都处在行军作战中，只能从实际工作中学一些东西，成绩很差。
      形势逼人　急起直追
    1949年夏天部队入城以后，学习了党的七届二中全会决议和毛主席的“论人民民主专政”，受到了深刻的教育。二中全会决议和毛主席的文章都指出，由于革命形势的发展，过去我们熟悉的东西有些快要闲起来了，而我们不熟悉的东西正强迫我们去作，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。又亲眼看到随着国家工农业和其它各种事业的飞速发展，军队的技术装备得到不断改善，现代化的兵种一个一个地建立起来，新的技术兵器日益增多。在这大量的新事物面前，自己所不懂的东西是愈来愈多了，因此感到形势逼人，必须很好学习。
    1952年，全军开始了现代化训练，总政治部进一步指出了迅速提高部队文化水平、培养大批工农知识分子对军队现代化建设的重要意义，这时我已调到师里工作，每天都要阅读审批许多材料，有时还要亲自写东西，但由于文化水平的限制，效率低，感到吃力，写出来的东西，往往连自己也不满意。这使我愈来愈感到：摆在自己面前的只有一条道路：急起直追，赶上形势。
    决心有了，随之而来的是从哪里学起？是泛泛地见什么学什么呢？还是系统地有计划地学习呢？经过反复思虑，觉得革命工作是长期的，应当从头学起，并从长远着眼坚持系统地有计划的学习。从1951年冬到现在七年多的时间里，在文化知识方面，我复习了高小算术，学了初中和高中的代数、平面几何、平面三角、立体几何、物理、化学、达尔文主义基础，另外，还学了语法修词讲话、形式逻辑、初步高等数学教程，阅读了三国志、红楼梦、水浒等古典作品。在政治理论方面，我反复学习了政治经济学资本主义部分，再论无产阶级专政的历史经验，关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题，苏共党史教程，社会主义教育课程（最低限度部分），毛泽东选集等。在军事技术知识方面，随着部队的训练进度，我利用参加教学法集训和下部队等时机，对步兵、炮兵、装甲、通讯等兵种的技术和战术有了粗浅的了解，并掌握了初步操作技能，如驾驶汽车、坦克，使用无线电等。
  文化提高　好处无穷
    七年来的不间断学习，使我深深感觉到文化科学知识对政治理论学习的帮助很大。拿军事技术的学习来说，由于自己掌握了初步的文化科学知识，对于许多技术兵器的学习比较省力，一经教员指点就可以懂得。如射击当中为什么常常发生轻弹远重弹近的现象，自己就能够理解到这是由于受了地心引
  力和物体的动者恒动，静者恒静，惯性定律作用所产生的；坦克发动机的全速调整器的工作原理是比较难于弄懂的，自己从它的构造就可以从力学上所讲的离心力向心力的基本原理，找到解释。又如在技术革命中，发现某团自行火炮营连长邵继清发明了射击米位换算表，自己看了以后知道他是按对数原理制的，就可以予以鉴定，肯定其价值。
    经过学习掌握了一定文化科学知识和理论知识以后，自己的眼界开阔了，思路打开了，这对工作有直接指导意义和影响。我参加革命后的很长时间里，在一定的程度上是凭热情、凭经验进行工作，有些工作表现不稳不准，往往是工作完了，对就对了，错就错了，不能比较迅速、准确地找出成败经验来，上升到一定高度。经过学习，近几年来的工作就比较好一些，心中有了一点数。
      安排时间　解决矛盾
    在坚持自学学习中，除了党的领导，上级的鼓励，同志们的帮助以外，切实解决工作和学习的矛盾，是一个带有决定性的问题。在职自修，工作和学习总是有矛盾的，矛盾的中心是时间问题。只要认真地去分析处理，这个矛盾是可以解决的。我的体会是首先要加强工作组织计划性，并尽量做到今日工作今日完成。工作安排好了，学习时间就有了。同时，我们的工作有时在机关，有时下部队，不可能有一个安静的环境，也必须走到哪里学到哪里，哪怕有十分钟时间，也要争取作一个习题、看一段书。总之，实践证明，只要培植起爱读书爱学习的习惯，把学习看成同工作、吃饭、睡觉一样的重要，就可以成为时间的主人，消除没有时间的忧虑，就能利用一切可能利用的空隙时间进行学习。
    端正态度　拜人为师
    端正学习态度，拜人人为师，克服学习困难，这一点也十分重要。毛主席教导说：
  “知识的问题是一个科学问题，来不得半点的虚伪和骄傲，决定地需要的倒是其反面——诚实和谦逊的态度。”又说：要“恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学。不懂就是不懂，不要装懂。”这些都告诉我们，要学一点东西，必须老老实实下苦功夫。在我长期自修中遇到的困难较多，这些话曾给了我巨大的鼓舞和力量。为了学习，就要放下架子，以普通劳动者的身份当学生，拜人人为师，课文学习，机关里很多同志都是我的讲师。理论联系实际时，分队里技术兵器、装备、教具均为学习工具，技术军官、技师、电工、修理工、驾驶员、司机均为我师，每逢接触就向其学习。当课程较深时，拜中学教师为老师，讲解难点，到试验室看模型或作试验。总之，只要有其长就为我师，登门拜访，不耻下问，让其传授知识。同时，在学习过程中不断地与自己思想上产生的懒惰情绪进行斗争，使自己坚持下来。这种情绪不外来自两个方面：第一是由于工作忙，一天工作后精神比较疲倦，精力负担过重，再加上学习的时候经常有电话或来人中断学习，往往产生不想学的念头；其次是自修不断碰到困难，如学习牛顿二项式定理多项式的应用、反三角函数时习题解不开，产生了急躁情绪。每当我遇到这些问题，我就尽量克服自己，安静下来，从这房间走到那房间，看看墙壁上马克思的名言，高尔基、奥斯特洛夫说过的话，想想党的教导，于是又振作起来。马克思名言：在科学上面是没有平坦道路可走的，只有在攀登上不畏劳苦，不畏险阻的人，才有希望攀登到光辉的顶点。是我学习中的座右铭，给了我克服困难的勇气和力量。
    要坚持在职自修，既要工作，又要学习，没有充沛的精力，没有一个健康的体魄是不行的。因此，我每天按时睡，按时起，起床后到野外跑二十分钟，春夏秋每天打打篮球，进行种菜等生产劳动。总之，每天都进行一些体力活动，使脑神经和整个身体得到适当调剂，对工作和学习都有很大好处。
    几年来，我坚持了自学，比过去也有了一些进步，但按党的要求来衡量，仍然作得不够，今后有决心在党的领导下，把学习搞得更好，力争大踏步前进！
