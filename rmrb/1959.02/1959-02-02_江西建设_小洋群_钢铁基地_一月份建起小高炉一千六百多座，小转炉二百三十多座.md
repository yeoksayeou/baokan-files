Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 31st. More than 500,000 staff and workers on the steel front in Jiangxi Province are working with soaring enthusiasm and high spirits, achieving a double harvest in both production and construction in the first month of this year. In terms of production, according to statistics on the 27th, the total output of steel reached more than 17,000 tons, of which the quality of iron is mostly standard gray iron and white iron. In terms of infrastructure, 75 small-scale steel bases across the province have newly built 1,624 blast furnaces with a volume of 3 to 13 cubic meters, and more than 230 steelmaking converters with a volume of 0.5 to 1.2 tons. Many bases are equipped with blowers, ore crushers, generators, and hot blast devices, and have also self-made a large number of indigenous and foreign transportation tools, beginning to stride forward on the "small foreign-style clusters" of iron and steel.

Since entering the winter, the leading departments of Jiangxi Province have made a series of preparations for a greater leap forward in steel production this year. On the one hand, a comprehensive rectification, consolidation, and improvement of the small indigenous clusters was carried out, and the "five fixes" were generally implemented. On the other hand, communist education was conducted, and employees were mobilized to formulate production plans and improve labor management.

After the above measures were taken, the broad masses of staff and workers launched a vigorous and enthusiastic competition to strive for the upper reaches. More than 40,000 staff and workers in the Gannan Administrative Region, undeterred by the severe cold, worked day and night in the deep mountains, valleys, and river beaches, taking turns panning for iron sand and digging coal, storing more than 20,000 tons of raw materials and fuel for the base. In the competition, employees in various places also generally paid attention to innovating tools and technologies. Workers at the Hechuan Steel Plant in Yongxin County, Ji'an Prefecture, increased the daily output per furnace from more than 1,000 jin to more than 5,000 jin, and ensured the quality. With the improvement of production technology, the production costs of many steel plants throughout the province have been reduced. The costs of steel plants in Ji'an Prefecture have generally decreased by 20% to 50%.

    江西建设“小洋群”钢铁基地
    一月份建起小高炉一千六百多座，小转炉二百三十多座
    据新华社南京31日电　江西省奋战在钢铁战线上的五十多万职工群众，干劲冲天，意气昂扬，在今年头一个月中，就获得了生产、基建双丰收。生产方面，据27日统计，钢铁产量共达一万七千多吨，其中铁的质量，大部分是合乎标准的灰口铁和白口铁；基建方面，全省七十五个小型钢铁基地已经新建起三到十三立方公尺的高炉一千六百二十四座，○点五到一点二吨的炼钢转炉二百三十多个。许多基地装备了鼓风机、矿石粉碎机、发电机以及热风装置等，还自制了大批土洋交通运输工具，开始跨上了“小洋群”的骏马。
    江西省领导部门从进入冬季以来，就为今年钢铁生产的更大跃进作了一系列的准备工作。一方面对小土群进行了全面的整顿、巩固和提高工作，普遍实行了“五定”。另一方面，进行共产主义教育，发动职工制订了生产计划，改进了劳动管理。
    经过上述措施后，广大职工轰轰烈烈地展开了力争上游的竞赛。赣南行政区有四万多名职工不畏严寒，日夜在深山野谷和河滩上轮番淘铁砂、挖煤，为基地储备了两万多吨原料和燃料。各地职工在竞赛中还普遍注意了革新工具，革新技术。吉安专区永新县禾川钢铁厂的工人，把每炉日产量由一千多斤跃增到五千多斤，并且保证了质量。随着生产技术的提高，全省许多钢铁厂的生产成本降低了。吉安专区各钢铁厂的成本一般降低了20％到50％。
