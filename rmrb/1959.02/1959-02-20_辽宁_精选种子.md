Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 19th: People's communes in Liaoning are actively carrying out seed selection work in the preparation for spring plowing, with fertilizer taking the lead. By the end of January, the province had selected over 420 million jin of improved seeds for various crops. Among them, the seeds of sorghum, millet, and corn are sufficient for this year's sowing needs, and the selected seeds of other crops account for more than 40% of the required amount.

During last year's autumn harvest, Liaoning carried out mass field seed selection. A total of more than 1.23 billion jin of various crop seeds were initially selected in the fields and courtyards throughout the province. According to inspections in various places, although the quality of these seeds has greatly improved compared to last year after the initial selection, it still cannot meet the requirements after the improvement of conditions such as water, fertilizer, and soil. Therefore, starting in January, various places have mobilized some women and children to carry out seed selection work. In the selection process, people's communes in various places have formulated specific quality requirements and selection methods. Generally, large-grain seeds (including rice) are required to be selected grain by grain, and small-grain seeds are required to be wind-selected, screened, and water-selected to ensure that the seeds are dry, clean, pure, and full. The selected seeds are immediately checked according to standards. Qualified seeds are issued a certificate of qualification, and unqualified seeds are re-selected.

In order to implement the guiding principle of seed work of "self-breeding, self-selection, self-retention, and self-use as the mainstay, supplemented by regulation," more than 500 fine seed breeding farms have been established in people's communes in Liaoning Province.

    辽宁——精选种子
    据新华社沈阳19日电　辽宁各地人民公社在以肥为帅的备耕运动中，正在积极开展种子精选工作。到1月底，全省已精选出各种作物良种四亿二千多万斤，其中高粱、谷子、玉米的种子已够今年播种需要，其他作物精选出来的种子也已占需要量的40％以上。
    辽宁各地在去年秋收的时候，就进行了群众性的田间选种，全省在田间和场院共初选了各种作物种子十二亿三千多万斤。据各地检查，这些种子经过初选，质量虽然比去年大有提高，但是仍然不能适应水、肥、土等条件改善以后的要求。因此，从1月开始，各地又发动部分妇女和儿童进行种子精选工作。在精选中，各地人民公社都订出了具体的质量要求和精选办法，一般要求大粒种子（包括水稻）都要粒选，小粒种子要作到风选、筛选和水选，确实保证种子干、净、纯、饱。精选出来的种子，立即按标准检查，合格的发给合格证，不合格的重选。
    为了贯彻“自繁、自选、自留、自用为主，辅之以调剂”的种子工作方针，目前辽宁省各人民公社已经成立了五百多个良种繁育场。
