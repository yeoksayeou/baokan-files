Outside the car window, it was drizzling. The cold morning wind blew from the valley, causing the branches of the trees on both sides of the road to sway constantly. An hour later, the bus arrived at Lijiadu in Linchuan County, Jiangxi. Across the boundless fields, groups of people were scattered everywhere collecting fertilizer, wearing bamboo hats and cloaks, braving the wind and rain to shovel sod, dig manure pits, and make manure piles. Commune members responsible for transporting fertilizer moved back and forth in the fields. We got off the bus and took a closer look. Almost every plot of land had a manure pile or manure pit. A large manure pit in a field next to the station was about three zhang long and one zhang wide, with a sign next to it that read: Stored fertilizer: 3,000 dan.

Director Yuan of the Linchuan County Party Committee's Rural Work Department told us that Lijiadu became famous last year for its local chemical fertilizer production. Jiangxi Province and the Fuzhou Special District held on-site meetings there to learn from their experience. This year, not only is the local chemical fertilizer production doing well, but the farm manure collection is also in full swing. We thought to ourselves: It's truly well-deserved.

When we arrived at the Lidu Commune Party Committee, the First Secretary had gone to the county for a meeting, and other responsible persons had also gone down to the teams. Coincidentally, Secretary Huang Shouliang, who is in charge of agriculture, had just returned from the team. He warmly received us. He was about to give a report at the elementary school at noon, mobilizing the students to actively participate in fertilizer accumulation after returning home for the holiday. Therefore, as soon as we put down our backpacks, he began to introduce the situation. He said that recently, Lijiadu has been completely immersed in a surge of fertilizer accumulation. More than 10,000 people are mobilized every day. Everyone is working hard and full of energy. Many commune members are so enthusiastic about accumulating fertilizer that they often forget to eat, and the cafeteria has to delay meal times. Secretary Huang told us: The current progress of fertilizer accumulation is 100,000 dan of farm manure and 38 tons of local chemical fertilizer per day, which is twice as fast as the previous period.

After the autumn harvest, the Lijiadu Commune established a professional fertilizer accumulation team of more than a thousand people, restored seven local chemical fertilizer plants, and accumulated more than 60,000 dan of farm manure and produced more than 200 tons of local chemical fertilizer in two months. Later, the Commune Party Committee, considering this year's doubling of grain production plan, found the amount of fertilizer was still insufficient, and the spring plowing was approaching. Therefore, on the evening of January 25, it held an emergency meeting of production brigade branch secretaries, deciding to launch a mass fertilizer accumulation movement, and before the Spring Festival, to accumulate 800,000 dan of farm manure and produce 500 tons of local chemical fertilizer, completing the plan of "one pit per field, one thousand dan of fertilizer per pit." After the meeting, the brigade branch secretaries returned to their teams overnight and held meetings of team members. The commune members were extremely motivated and immediately formed various shock teams, and posted many big-character posters expressing their determination: Resolutely complete the fertilizer accumulation task and celebrate the Spring Festival. The next morning, before dawn, more than 10,000 cadres and commune members from the entire commune set out. Shock team members went up the mountains to shovel sod, and down to the fields to dig manure pits, using water wheels to dig pond mud; women cleaned houses and collected garbage; all of the commune's hundred-plus local chemical fertilizer plants also started working together. The transport teams moved back and forth in various villages, and the entire Lijiadu was boiling!

In his introduction, Comrade Huang Shouliang also told us many moving stories about fertilizer accumulation. I will only record one story here, "The Eighteen Female Generals Accumulating Fertilizer," which has been spread throughout the commune.

On the morning of January 27, it was drizzling, and the northwest wind was howling. At this time, eighteen young women from the Liu Hulan Shock Team of the Huaguang Brigade, wearing cloaks and carrying hoes, went up the mountain to accumulate fertilizer. They held hands and climbed the hillside, and after getting into position, they started working. The wind didn't stop, the rain didn't stop, and the young women worked harder and harder. Their faces were covered with sweat and water droplets. They wiped them with handkerchiefs, picked up their hoes and continued working. When they were tired, they sang the song "Socialism is Good," and their energy was renewed. That day, they shoveled ninety dan of sod, keeping pace with the Wu Song Shock Team composed of young men.

    李家渡沸腾起来了
    本报记者　刘光辉　亦石
    车窗外，细雨蒙蒙。清晨的冷风从山谷里刮过来，吹得公路两旁的树枝不停地摇摆。一小时以后，公共汽车开到了江西临川县李家渡。一望无际的田野上，到处散布着积肥的人群，他们头戴斗笠、身披蓑衣，正冒着风雨铲草皮、挖粪窖、做粪堆。担任运肥的社员在田间穿来穿去。我们下车留意看了看，几乎每丘田里都有了粪堆或粪窖，车站旁一丘田里的一个大粪窖，约有三丈长、一丈宽，插在旁边的一块牌子上写着：内存肥料三千担。
    临川县委农工部袁部长曾向我们说，李家渡去年搞土化肥出了名，江西省、抚州专区在那里开了现场会，学习他们的经验；今年不仅土化肥搞得好，农家肥也搞得轰轰烈烈。我们心里想：真是名不虚传。
    到了李渡公社党委会，第一书记上县里开会去了，其他的负责人也都下了队。也很凑巧，管农业的书记黄收亮同志刚从队里回来，他亲热的接待了我们。他正午要到小学做个报告，动员学生放假回家后要积极参加积肥，因此，我们一放下背包他就介绍情况。他说，最近几天，李家渡完全沉浸在积肥的热潮中，天天都有一万多人出动，真是人人动手，个个干劲冲天，许多社员因为积肥干得欢，常常忘记了吃饭，食堂里只得延迟开饭时间。黄书记告诉我们：现在积肥的进度是每日十万担农家肥，三十八吨土化肥，比前一时期加快了两倍。
    秋收后，李家渡公社便成立了一支上千人的积肥专业队，恢复了七个土化肥厂，两个多月积了六万多担农家肥，生产了二百多吨土化肥。后来，公社党委考虑到今年实现粮食产量翻一番的跃进计划，肥料数量还很不够，距离春耕又很近了，于是在1月25日晚上召开了生产大队支部书记紧急会议，决定掀起一个全民积肥运动，到春节前突击积八十万担农家肥，生产五百吨土化肥，完成“一丘一窖、一窖千担肥”的计划。会后大队支部书记连夜回队开了队员大会，社员们劲头大极了，立即成立了各种突击队，并贴出许多大字报表示决心：坚决完成积肥任务过春节。第二天早晨天还未亮，全社一万多名干部和社员出动了，突击队员们上山铲草皮，下田挖粪窖，车水挖塘泥；妇女们打扫房屋收集垃圾；全社一百多个土化肥厂也一齐开了工；搞运输的人马在各个村子里来来往往，整个李家渡都沸腾起来了。
    黄收亮同志在介绍情况中还告诉我们许多动人的积肥故事。现在只记下其中一个传诵全社的“十八名女将军积肥”的故事。
    1月27日早晨，下着毛毛雨，西北风刮得呼呼叫。这时，华光大队刘胡兰突击队十八个女青年身披蓑衣，扛着锄头上山积肥了，她们手拉着手爬上山坡后，拉开阵势就干了起来。风不停、雨不歇，女青年们越干越起劲，脸上挂满了汗滴和水珠，拿出手巾擦一下，挥起锄头又干，累了，就唱“社会主义好”的歌子，劲头又足了。这天，她们铲了九十担草皮，和由青年男子组成的武松突击队并驾齐驱。
