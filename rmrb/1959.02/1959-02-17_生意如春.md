	Business Like Spring
	Dong Shanyuan
	More than a decade ago, when I was an apprentice, every December, the shopkeeper would always paste a horizontal scroll of plum-red paper on the lintel of the store, on which were written the large characters "Business Like Spring," with gold edges on both ends of the red paper. This was the eve of the Spring Festival, and business in the store would usually boom for a while. After a period of intense busyness, there would be two or three days of rest during the Spring Festival. The shopkeeper would sit in the accounting room, shaking his head and sighing, repeatedly saying, "Another loss!"; the shop assistants and apprentices would wait anxiously for the shopkeeper to speak "official words," and perhaps someone would be fired. The four large characters "Business Like Spring" became a clear irony.
	Since the liberation of Beijing, ten Spring Festivals have passed. I have come to appreciate the taste of "spring" more deeply each year, feeling the dazzling spring light and the pleasant spring breeze. Everyone has their own different Spring Festival, and each Spring Festival has its own different content. Shop employees and workers spent the Spring Festival of 1952 in a face-to-face Five-Anti campaign against capitalists; they spent the Spring Festival of 1956 in inventory checking and asset verification, celebrating the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry; they spent the Spring Festival of 1958 in the full-scale leap forward of commercial work initiated by the Beijing Tianqiao Department Store. The spring feeling became richer year by year, the spring breeze became stronger year by year, and the flower of Tianqiao blossomed throughout the commercial sector, adding spring color to the magnificent and colorful garden of the motherland.
	During this year's Spring Festival, I came to the Tianqiao Department Store. Although it was a holiday, the leaders of the mall and the group leaders were still in the mall. In the morning, they watched TV for a while, and then talked about something in twos and threes, perhaps they were talking about this day last year.
	Last spring, the newspaper published their revolutionary initiative to improve commercial work, boldly breaking through conventions and proposing leap forward targets, but in just one year, it was already considered a relic. For example, when they made the proposal, they suggested that the average daily sales amount per person should be increased from 84 yuan to 136 yuan, but the actual amount reached 214 yuan; the improvement of labor efficiency was only one aspect, they excellently implemented the nationally renowned nine service covenants, and made great achievements in marching towards all-rounders; the quality of service continued to improve, and over the year, they received 8,000 written commendations from customers, and no salesperson had not been commended.
	The initiative of the Tianqiao Department Store, like a spring breeze, quickly swept across the country, because it represented the spring in the hearts of every commercial worker. Over the past year, more than 200,000 commercial workers from all over the country have come to the Tianqiao Department Store to visit and learn. They not only wanted to learn from Tianqiao and catch up with Tianqiao, but also to surpass Tianqiao, which promoted and helped the Tianqiao Department Store to keep moving forward and take the lead, forming a magnificent picture of national commercial work striving for prosperity and keeping up with the pace of the flying development of industrial and agricultural production. On the national commercial front, an unprecedented red flag movement was launched. Last year alone, 606 red flags were raised nationwide. From wholesale departments to retail stores, from warehousing and storage to processing and transportation, from barbershops to bathhouses, from hotels to canteens, red flags were planted everywhere, and increasingly more red flag streets and red flag towns appeared, truly "red flags fluttering like paintings." Not long ago, the Ministry of Commerce compiled the experiences of advanced commercial units across the country into "Commercial Red Flags." In the preface to this book, Vice Premier Li Xiannian wrote: "These flags are the product of the combination of Marxist-Leninist theory and the practice of commercial work in our country, and it is of great significance for guiding and improving future commercial work." The experiences of these more than 600 red flags will, like the spring breeze, sweep across the commercial sector of the country, setting off a new wave of enthusiasm like a spring tide, converging into a new leap forward torrent, and creating more and better flags under the leadership of the Party.
	Experience is such a valuable asset for further leaps forward. Last July, Zhao Weixin, a salesperson at the Tianqiao Department Store, accompanied the Beijing Youth Delegation on a visit to the Soviet Union. When she visited the Moscow Central Department Store, the store manager warmly and straightforwardly said: "We warmly welcome Chinese colleagues! Feel free to make any requests you have, we will try our best to meet your requirements." Zhao Weixin felt like she had entered a treasure trove, and returned with a wealth of experience in civilized business. She summarized these experiences into one sentence: "Continue until the customer's requirements are met." Isn't this the common language of socialist commercial workers? They not only work excellently behind the counter, but also closely follow production, serving as the logistics department of the industrial and agricultural front and the housekeepers of millions of working people. In order to meet the needs of customers, commercial workers are active and fighting beside steelmaking furnaces, in deep plowing fields, under scaffolding, on transportation lines, in newly developed oil fields, and on the islands on the Fujian front. Neither severe cold nor scorching heat, neither high mountains nor great rivers, can hinder their progress. Their bold words are "Give happiness to customers, and keep the difficulties for ourselves." In fact, with this light and heat full of communist style and youthful vitality, all difficulties will be melted, leaving only the gentle spring breeze, making people feel boundless warmth. I saw a customer write in the customer feedback book of the Tianqiao Department Store: "Under your warm hospitality, I bought a bag of the best candy. The taste of the candy will soon disappear, only you, salesperson No. 5095, your enthusiastic smile and kind words, will remain in my heart." Whenever I see these commendations, I naturally think of spring!
	In the afternoon, the Tianqiao Department Store held a symposium, and the group leaders once again studied their leap forward plan for this year. They repeatedly studied how to deepen "three participations and one change," how to develop all-rounders, how to improve technology, how to eliminate errors...The upstream has no end, and the more they leap forward, the more they feel dissatisfied, so they naturally put forward higher demands on themselves. I participated in their discussion, and thought of the Party's instructions: "Economic work must be done more and more meticulously." Yes, Tianqiao's achievements are precisely the result of resolutely implementing the Party's instructions, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, and following the mass line under the leadership of the Party. This is an invincible experience. Everyone knows that the industrial and agricultural front is ushering in a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year, and commercial work is facing a more glorious and arduous task. How can the staff of Tianqiao Department Store sit at home? Moreover, it is not only the staff of Tianqiao Department Store who cannot sit at home?
	It is the best time of the year for spring, business is like spring, and the future is bright. On the commercial front, the flower of "Tianqiao" will surely bloom more and more red.

    生意如春
    董善元
    十几年前，在我学徒的时候，年年腊月，掌柜的总要在商店的门楣上贴一张梅红纸的横批，大书“生意如春”，红纸的两头还要镶上金边。这时候就是春节前夕了，店里的生意照例会热闹一阵。经过紧张的忙碌以后，在春节里有两三天的休息时间，掌柜的坐在账房里摇头叹气，频频地说：“又亏了”；店员和学徒们提心吊胆地等待着掌柜的说“官话”，说不定谁会被解雇。“生意如春”这四个大字便成了鲜明的讽刺。
    北京解放以来，已经过了十个春节了。我一年比一年深刻地体会到“春”的滋味，感到春光耀眼、春风宜人。各人有各人不同的春节，每个春节也有它不同的内容。店员工人们曾经在和资本家进行面对面的五反斗争中度过1952年的春节；在清产核资、欢庆全行业公私合营中度过1956年的春节；在北京天桥百货商场提出革命倡议、展开了商业工作全面大跃进当中度过1958年的春节。春意一年比一年浓，春风一年比一年劲，天桥之花开遍了商业部门，在绚烂多彩的祖国大花园里增加了春色。
    今年的春节里，我来到天桥百货商场。虽然是假期，但商场的领导人和小组长们还都在商场里。上午，他们看了一会儿电视，然后又三三两两地在谈论着什么，也许他们正在谈起了去年的今天。
    去年春天，报纸上发表了他们的改进商业工作的革命倡议，大胆地突破陈规，提出跃进指标，可是仅仅一年时间，那已经算是陈迹了。比如在倡议时，他们提出每人每天的平均销货金额由八十四元提高到一百三十六元，实际达到了二百一十四元；劳动效率提高还只是一方面，他们出色地执行了闻名全国的九项服务公约，并且在向多面手进军中取得了很大成绩；服务质量不断提高，一年来受到了顾客的书面表扬八千多件，没有一个售货员没有得到过表扬。
    天桥商场的倡议，像春风一样迅速地吹遍全国，因为它代表着每个商业职工心里的春天。一年来，全国各地到天桥商场来参观和访问的商业工作者就有二十多万人。他们不仅要学天桥、赶天桥，而且要超过天桥，这也就促进和帮助了天桥商场马不停蹄，一马当先，万马奔腾，形成了全国商业工作争荣并发的壮丽图景，跟上了工农业生产飞跃发展的步伐。在全国的商业战线上，开展了声势空前的红旗运动，去年一年，全国就先后树起了六百零六面红旗。从批发部门到零售商店，从仓储保管到加工调运，从理发馆到浴池，从旅店到食堂，到处都插上了红旗，并且越来越多地出现了红旗街、红旗镇，真是“风展红旗如画”。不久以前，商业部把全国商业先进单位的经验汇集编选成“商业红旗”，李先念副总理为这本书所写的序言中说：“这些旗帜是马列主义理论同我国商业工作的实践相结合的产物，它对于指导和改进今后的商业工作，有着重要的意义。”这六百多面红旗的经验，将同样地像春风一样，吹遍全国的商业部门，掀起春潮一样的新的干劲，汇成一股新的跃进巨流，在党的领导下，创造出更多更好的旗帜来。
    经验，对于再跃进是多么宝贵的财富。去年7月，天桥商场的售货员赵维新曾经随同北京市青年代表团访问过苏联。当她参观和访问莫斯科中央百货商店的时候，商店经理热情而且直爽地说：“我们非常欢迎中国同行！你有什么要求尽管提吧，我们尽量满足你的要求。”赵维新如入宝库，收获丰硕，饱载了文明经商的经验归来。她把这些经验概括成一句话：“一直到满足顾客的要求为止”。这句话不正是社会主义商业工作者的共同语言吗？他们不仅在柜台里出色地工作，而且要紧紧地跟上生产，作工农业战线的后勤部，作千百万劳动大军的管家人。为了满足顾客的需求，在炼钢炉旁，在深翻地里，在脚手架下，在运输线上，在新开发的油田，在福建前线的海岛，都有商业职工在活动、在战斗。无论是严寒酷暑，无论是高山大河，都不能阻碍他们前进。他们的豪语是“把愉快送给顾客，把困难留给自己”。其实，具有了这种充满着共产主义风格、充满着青春活力的光和热，一切困难都将被溶化，留下的只有拂面春风，使人感到无边温暖。我在天桥商场的顾客意见簿上就看到过一位顾客写下这样的话：“在您的热情招待下，我买了一包最好的糖。糖的味道会很快消失，只有您，5095号售货员热情的笑和亲切的语言，会留在我的心里。”每当我看到这些表扬时，我就自然地联想到春天！
    下午，天桥商场开起了座谈会，各小组长们又一次研究他们今年的跃进规划。他们反复地研究着“三参一改”如何深入一步，多面手如何向前发展，如何提高技术，如何消灭差错……。上游无止境，越跃进越感到不满足，便自然地对自己提出更高的要求。我参加了他们的讨论，并且想到了党的指示：“经济工作一定要愈作愈细致”。是的，天桥的成绩正是坚决执行党的指示，在党的领导下，坚持政治挂帅，走群众路线而取得的。这是一条战无不胜的经验。谁都知道，今年的工农业战线正在掀起更大更好更全面的跃进，商业工作正面临着更加光荣艰巨的任务，天桥商场的职工们，怎么能在家里坐得住呢？而且，在家里坐不住的又何止是天桥商场的职工呢？
    正是一年春好处，生意如春，前程似锦，在商业战线上，“天桥”之花，必将越开越红。
