Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, February 18th: The Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs handed a note to the Yugoslav Legation in Tirana on the 17th, expressing strong protest against the slander campaign launched by Yugoslavia against Albania. The note pointed out that the Yugoslav newspaper "Politika" published a piece of news on February 9, reporting a recent frame-up case plotted by the Yugoslav government in Prizren. The newspaper insisted that someone had handed over information about Yugoslavia's economy and armed forces to the Albanian Embassy in Belgrade. This fabrication by the Yugoslav authorities and newspapers, and this malicious attack on Albania and its Embassy in Belgrade, is not only untrue but also pursuing a premeditated purpose, namely, to slander the Albanian government's peaceful policies, to intensify the anti-Albanian and anti-socialist countries' hostile campaign, and deliberately to provoke incidents that endanger the relations between the two neighboring countries.

The note went on to point out that the publication in the Yugoslav newspaper "Borba" of an unwarranted provocative article about Albania's poor treatment of Yugoslav diplomats was also for the same purpose. The fact is quite the contrary, Yugoslav diplomats enjoy all the rights and conditions for normal work, just like diplomats from other countries stationed in Tirana. The note emphasized that the Albanian Embassy in Belgrade, as well as other Albanian institutions, have never interfered in Yugoslavia's internal affairs, neither in the past nor now. On the contrary, many well-known facts prove that it is the Yugoslav government and the Yugoslav Embassy staff in Tirana who have frequently interfered in Albania's internal affairs in the past and present, carrying out hostile activities against Albania in various forms.

    阿尔巴尼亚政府发出照会
    抗议南斯拉夫的诽谤运动
    新华社地拉那18日电　阿尔巴尼亚外交部17日交给南斯拉夫驻地拉那公使馆一份照会，对南斯拉夫展开的诽谤阿尔巴尼亚的运动表示强硬抗议。照会指出，南斯拉夫“政治报”在2月9日刊载了一则消息，报道南斯拉夫政府最近在普利斯伦市策划的一个诬告案。这家报纸硬说什么曾经有一个人把南斯拉夫的经济和武装部队的情报交给阿尔巴尼亚驻贝尔格莱德公使馆。南斯拉夫当局和报纸的这种捏造以及对阿尔巴尼亚和它驻贝尔格莱德公使馆这种别有用心的攻击，不仅不符合实际情况，而且是追随一个预谋的目的，即污蔑阿尔巴尼亚政府的和平政策，变本加厉地煽动对阿尔巴尼亚和其他社会主义国家的敌视运动，蓄意挑起危害两个毗邻国家关系的事件。
    照会接着指出，南斯拉夫“战斗报”刊登的关于阿尔巴尼亚对南斯拉夫外交官的恶劣态度的一篇无端挑衅的文章，也是抱着同样目的的。事实正好相反，南斯拉夫外交官同驻地拉那的其他国家的外交官一样，享受着各种权利和正常工作的条件。照会强调指出，阿尔巴尼亚驻贝尔格莱德公使馆以及阿尔巴尼亚的其他机构过去和现在都从来没有干涉过南斯拉夫的内政。恰恰相反，许多众所周知的事实证明，正是南斯拉夫政府和南斯拉夫驻地拉那的公使馆人员过去和现在都经常干涉阿尔巴尼亚的内政，以各种形式对阿尔巴尼亚进行敌视活动。
