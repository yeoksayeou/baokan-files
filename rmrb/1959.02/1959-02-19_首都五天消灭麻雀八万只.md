Xinhua News Agency, February 17th—The people of the capital launched a sparrow-killing campaign starting February 13th. According to incomplete statistics from fourteen districts, more than 81,000 sparrows have been eliminated in the past five days.

    This sparrow-killing campaign was timed before the sparrow breeding season. Based on the sparrows' fear of cold and relatively concentrated habitat, a comprehensive strategy of poisoning as the main method, supplemented by beating and nest-robbing, was generally adopted.
