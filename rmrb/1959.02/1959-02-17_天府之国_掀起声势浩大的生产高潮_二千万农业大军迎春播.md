(From our correspondent in Chengdu, February 16th) The warm spring has arrived, and the "Land of Abundance" has set off a massive upsurge in agricultural production. After the Spring Festival, Sichuan Province mobilized 20 million laborers to engage in the battle centered on welcoming spring planting. In southern Sichuan, where the season comes earlier, spring plowing has already begun in some areas. In the thousand-mile basin, fields are filled with people accumulating and delivering fertilizer, watering wheat and rapeseed, and deep plowing the land and leveling rice seedling fields. In some areas, early rice, potatoes, sugarcane, and sweet potatoes have already been sown. Sweet potato seeds cultivated in soil-warmed beds have already sprouted lush green seedlings.

The biggest characteristics of Sichuan Province's efforts to greet spring planting are early action, large scale, and high quality. In accordance with the spirit of "seize the beginning and maintain the grip from beginning to end" instructed by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), various preparatory activities were launched a month earlier than in previous years, starting in December of last year. On February 6th, the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee issued a call to the province to quickly set off an upsurge in agricultural production. Party committees at all levels in various regions and counties relayed the message down through the ranks overnight. On February 7th, the people's communes convened mobilization rallies, formulating leap-forward measures. After a period of recuperation and full preparation during the Spring Festival, people immediately took action with soaring enthusiasm, striving to take the initiative everywhere, so that the "Eight-Point Charter" with fertilizer taking the lead could be fully implemented. To date, the province has accumulated one trillion jin of various fertilizers. Many paddy fields have now been fertilized with 50,000 to 100,000 jin of base fertilizer, and the quality of fertilizer is also better than in previous years. At the same time, all regions have paid special attention to strengthening deep plowing. Within more than a month, the Neijiang Special District deep plowed 480,000 mu of paddy fields, with general deep plowing exceeding one chi (Chinese foot, about 1/3 meter), and about 25%-30% deep plowed about two chi. Good rice seeds were also prepared early. More than 200 million jin of seeds have been mutually adjusted by the communes throughout the province.

To ensure water for spring planting, the Daxian, Mianyang, and Wanxian Special Districts alone had built more than 8,000 small-scale water conservancy projects by January. There are more than 24,000 water conservancy projects under construction throughout the province, which, when completed, can irrigate more than 14.4 million mu of paddy fields. All regions have also paid close attention to water storage and conservation. This year, counties such as Bazhong, Tongjiang, and Pingchang, which were often threatened by drought in the past, have full ponds and full fields.

Vigorously grasping the rational allocation of labor and vigorously carrying out tool reform have become the most prominent tasks of party committees at all levels. All regions are trying their best to reduce non-productive personnel and put labor into the most urgently needed field operations. Pingchang, Meishan and other counties clarified priorities and urgent needs, rectified labor organization, and fully exploited the role of auxiliary labor, so that the labor force invested in agricultural production has more than doubled compared to the past.

In order to solve the shortage of labor, a tool manufacturing activity centered on promoting improved tools for spring plowing and spring sowing and repairing small farm tools has been launched throughout the province. At present, more than 10,000 farm tool factories and repair shops throughout the province are working day and night to rush-produce major farm tools for transplanting seedlings, deep plowing, sowing, lifting water, transplanting, pest control, and transporting fertilizer. At present, 500,000 sets of rope-drawn machines and 1 million deep plowing plows, which are most urgently needed for spring plowing, have been basically rushed out and put into production one after another. One million simple rice transplanters, which can reduce a lot of labor, are also being manufactured by factories run by the communes themselves, and it is expected that all of them will be rushed out before March. According to the characteristics of large-scale production after communization this year, Wenjiang, Luzhou, Nanchong, Yibin and other special districts have generally carried out tool reform. Yibin Special District recently held on-site meetings for farm tool appraisal and promotion from the special district to the county, and rushed to produce transplanters, seeders, tractors and paddy field deep plows. It is estimated that 3,000 transplanters can be manufactured before the full-scale spring plowing begins, which can reduce the transplanting manpower in the entire region from 7 million to more than 900,000.

In this vigorous production movement, party committee secretaries at all levels are taking the lead, participating in production, leading production, and party organizations are at the forefront of the movement. On February 11, after the Spring Festival, party committee secretaries at all levels in Nanchong Special District and the people all went out together. Ge Runsheng, secretary of the prefectural party committee, and Sun Guilin and Wu Zhizhong, deputy secretaries, personally pulled carts to transport fertilizer to the fields. The relationship between cadres and the masses is unprecedentedly close, and the masses respond to the various calls of the party committee with a single call, and fight wherever the party points. After leading the masses to summarize the achievements and experiences of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the party committees in various regions widely discussed with the masses the plan for a greater leap forward this year, which inspired the infinitely high labor enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members. From the elderly to the children, all were involved in this production upsurge, and the momentum was greater than any previous movement.

According to this new situation, recently, under the organization and leadership of the party committees, labor competitions comparing energy, measures, and output have been universally launched. Since the Shangxia People's Commune in Daxian Special District issued a challenge to the province for high rice and wheat yields, 26 communes in southern Sichuan, northern Sichuan, and western Sichuan immediately responded. The Nanchong Special District and Wenjiang Special District have launched a large-scale high-yield competition movement in various counties. After Yuechi County launched a competition at a mobilization meeting attended by 210,000 people, people's communes throughout the county launched a production competition craze of challenge and response.

    “天府之国”掀起声势浩大的生产高潮
    二千万农业大军迎春播
    川南开始春耕千里盆地到处是人群各地争取主动全面贯彻“八字宪法”
    本报成都16日电　暖春来到，“天府之国”掀起了声势浩大的农业生产高潮。春节过后四川全省就出动了二千万人的劳动大军，投入以迎接春播为中心的战斗。季节较早的川南地区有的已开始春耕。千里盆地的田野上，到处是积肥送粪、浇灌麦子、油菜和深翻土地、平整秧田的人群。有些地区早稻、洋芋、甘蔗、红苕等已经下种。用土温床培育的红苕种，有的已抽出绿油油的幼苗。
    四川省在鼓足干劲迎接春播中的最大特点是动手早、规模大、质量高。各地根据中共四川省委指示的“一开头就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧”的精神，从去年12月份起比往年早一个月就展开了各种备耕活动。2月6日中共四川省委又向全省发出迅速掀起农业生产高潮的号召，各地、县委星夜层层向下传达。7日各人民公社纷纷召开誓师大会，制定跃进措施。经过春节期间的养精蓄锐和充分准备之后，春节一过，人们以冲天干劲立即行动起来，处处力争主动，使肥料挂帅的“八字宪法”得到全面贯彻。到目前为止，全省已积造各种肥料一万亿斤。许多稻田现已施下底肥五万斤到十万斤，肥料质量也比往年好。与此同时，各地特别注意加强深耕工作。内江专区在一个多月内，深耕水田四十八万亩，一般深耕都在一尺以上，约有25％—30％深耕二尺左右。水稻良种也及早作了准备。全省由各公社相互调剂的种子已有二亿多斤。
    为保证春播用水，仅达县、绵阳、万县等专区到1月份就已修好小型水利工程八千多处。全省正在赶工的水利工程有二万四千多处，完工后可灌溉水田一千四百多万亩。各地还十分注意蓄水保水。过去经常遭受干旱威胁的巴中、通江、平昌等县，今年都是塘满田满。
    大抓合理安排劳力和大搞工具改革，已成为当前各级党委一项最为突出的工作。各地都尽量压缩非生产人员，把劳动力投入到最急需的田间作业上。平昌、眉山等县分清主次和轻重缓急，整顿劳动组织，充分发挥辅助劳力的作用后，投入农业生产的劳力比过去增加了一倍多。
    为了解决劳力不足，一个以推广春耕春播改良工具和整修小农具为中心的工具制造活动已在全省展开。目前，全省一万多个农具厂和修配厂，正在日夜赶制栽秧、深耕、播种、提水、移栽、治虫、运肥等主要农具。现在，当前春耕最急需的五十万部绳索牵引机、一百万部深耕犁已基本赶制完毕，陆续投入生产。能够减轻大量劳动的一百万部水稻简易插秧机，也正由各社办工厂自行制造中，预计在3月份以前就将全部赶制完毕。根据今年公社化后大面积生产的特点，温江、泸州、南充、宜宾等专区，都普遍进行了工具改革。宜宾专区最近从专区到县，层层召开了农具鉴定和推广的现场会议，大量赶制插秧机、播种机、牵引机和水田深耕犁。预计在春耕全面展开前，即可造出三千部插秧机，可使全区插秧人力由七百万个减少到九十万多个。
    在这轰轰烈烈的生产运动中，各地党委书记都是身先士卒，参加生产领导生产，党组织走在运动前头。2月11日春节过后，南充专区各级党委书记和全民一齐出动。地委书记戈润生、副书记孙桂林、吴致中都亲自拉板车向田里运肥。干群关系空前密切，群众对党委的各项号召是一呼百动，党指到哪里，就战斗到哪里。各地党委领导群众对1958年大跃进的成绩和经验进行了总结后，又把今年更大跃进的计划交群众广泛讨论，从而激发了广大社员无比高涨的劳动热情。从老人到儿童全都卷入到这个生产高潮中来了，声势之大，超过了过去历次运动。
    根据这种新形势，最近各地在党委的组织领导下，普遍展开热火朝天的比干劲、比措施、比产量的劳动竞赛。自达县专区上峡人民公社向全省发出稻麦高产的挑战后，川南、川北、川西马上就有二十六个社起来响应。南充专区和温江专区各县掀起了大面积高产竞赛运动。岳池县在有二十一万人参加的誓师大会上发起竞赛后，全县各人民公社都掀起了挑战应战的生产竞赛热潮。（附图片）
