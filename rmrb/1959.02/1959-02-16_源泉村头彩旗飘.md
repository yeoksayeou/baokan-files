Colorful Flags Fluttering at the Entrance of Yuanquan Village

The darkness before dawn shrouded the earth. Zibo City, Shandong Province, after a night of beating by the north wind, seemed particularly quiet in its streets and alleys.

The fertilizer delivery team led by Sun Yingjin, Secretary of the Boshan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and composed of various units, advanced towards Yuanquan Village like a long dragon. Secretary Sun was particularly neatly dressed, with a snow-white towel tightly wrapped around his head, and wearing a well-fitting blue Zhongshan suit. He swung his arms, bent over, lowered his head, and pulled the pushcart at a rapid pace. Young men, seeing the Secretary's cart running ahead so steadily, felt a surge of competitive fire burning in their hearts, and pulled their carts to catch up. Sweat soaked through everyone's clothes, and plumes of heat rose from everyone's head. Secretary Sun, seeing that the cart of Secretary Li of the Supervisory Committee was catching up, quickly took off the white towel from his head, wiped away the hot sweat, spat, and then pulled the cart forward again with a burst of speed.

At ten o'clock, the fertilizer transport team began to rest at Secretary Sun's suggestion. Under the cliff beside the road, it suddenly became a lively entertainment venue: some talked, some joked, some simply lay on their backs to rest, and others chatted heart to heart. Someone, no one knew from which unit, picked up two tiles and started singing, causing everyone to burst into hearty laughter, and fatigue was long gone to the back of beyond. The fertilizer transport team began to move forward again.

From Qiaoling to Yuanquan is about twenty miles, all steep slopes, it is really difficult to exert strength, forty-one pushcarts, stretched out for more than four miles, crawling on the large and small steep slopes. Some comrades really felt tired, their legs stiff and unable to bend, their feet were gnawed by their shoes, bleeding and blistered. But they did not stop for a single step.

The warm sun shone directly, a sea of colorful flags fluttered at the entrance of Yuanquan Village, and the sound of gongs and drums and singing shook the sky. The villagers were all smiles, welcoming the team on both sides of the road. Amidst intense applause, the forty-one fertilizer transport vehicles victoriously delivered seventeen thousand jin of fertilizer and three thousand jin of bran to their destination. (Peng Yi)

    源泉村头彩旗飘
    黎明前的黑幕，笼罩着大地。熟睡的山东淄博市由于北风吹打了一宿，大街小巷显得格外寂静。
    中共博山区委孙迎晋书记率领的由各单位组成的送肥队，像一条长龙似地，向源泉村前进着。孙书记打扮得特别利落，雪白的毛巾紧扎着头，穿着一身合体的蓝中山服。他，甩开手，躬着腰，低着头，猛拉急跑，地排车迅速飞行。小伙子们眼看书记车奔在前头，走的那样稳健，一阵好胜的烈火急燃心头，拉起车急追猛赶。汗湿透了每个人的衣服，每个人的头上都冒着一股股的热气。孙书记看看监委李书记的车紧赶了上来，急忙从头上猛地拿下白毛巾，擦了一把热汗，吐了一口痰，拉起车又是一阵急行。
    十点钟，运肥队在孙书记的提议下开始休息了。公路边的崖头下，顿时变成一个活泼的娱乐场所：有说的，有闹的，有就地仰面朝天养神的，也有谈心的。也不知是哪个单位的同志拿起两个瓦片敲打着唱了起来，引起大家一阵畅心的欢笑，疲劳早被赶到九霄云外。运肥队又开始前进。
    从樵岭到源泉约二十多里，一路陡坡，真是有劲难使，四十一辆地排车，拉开四里多长，爬行在大小陡坡上。部分同志确实感到疲乏了，两只腿直挺挺地不敢打弯，脚被鞋啃破了流出血，磨成泡。但他们却没有停止过一步。
    暖阳直射，源泉村头飘起彩旗的海洋，锣鼓声歌唱声震荡着天空，社员们满脸堆笑，夹道欢迎。四十一辆运肥车在一阵激烈的掌声中，把一万七千斤大肥和三千斤糠，胜利地运到了目的地。　（彭毅）
