    Developing Artistic Exchanges Between Chinese and Soviet Artists
    Soviet Cartoon Exhibition Opens in Beijing

    Xinhua News Agency, February 5th. A Soviet Cartoon Exhibition, sponsored by the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, opened this morning at Zhongshan Park in Beijing.

    Russian People's Artist Yefimov and Ukrainian Honored Artist Litvinenko, who are currently visiting China, attended the opening ceremony of the exhibition. Yefimov said in his speech: Although the scale of this exhibition is not large, it marks a further strengthening of cultural exchanges between the Soviet Union and China and will help consolidate the creative friendship between artists of the two countries. He warmly hoped that the Soviet Cartoon Exhibition would make a beneficial contribution to the development of cultural and artistic exchanges between China and the Soviet Union.

    Before Yefimov's speech, Zhang Xiruo, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Ye Qianyu, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Artists Association, spoke successively. Zhang Xiruo gave a high evaluation of the exhibited works. He said that the main characteristics of these works are the close combination of politics and art, with rich ideological content and militancy. He believed that this exhibition not only provides a good opportunity for Chinese artists to learn from Soviet cartoons and further develop the friendship between the art circles of our two countries, but also will arouse greater interest in Soviet cartoons among the broad masses of the Chinese people.

    Ye Qianyu said that the Chinese people have a strong interest in Soviet satirical art. The experience of Soviet cartoon creation, like the experience of other Soviet literary creations, is the best teacher and friend we often learn from.

    Soviet Embassy in China Counselor Sudarikov, Weili Xiajin, and staff members of various countries' embassies in China were invited to attend the opening ceremony.

    Also attending the opening ceremony were Luo Jun, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Ge Baoquan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Cai Ruohong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Artists Association, and cartoonists Zhang Guangyu, Hua Junwu, Mi Gu, and others.

    The exhibition features a total of one hundred and five works, which are some of the excellent works of six famous cartoonists and the "Fighting Pencil" collective creation group of eleven cartoonists from the four cities of Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, and Tallinn. The exhibits are rich and colorful, covering all aspects of the Soviet Union in various revolutionary periods and the struggle to defend world peace. Among these exhibits are cartoons and propaganda posters created by Yefimov and Litvinenko.
