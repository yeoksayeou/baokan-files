Niter soil is a topsoil rich in nitrate nitrogen, a product containing organic matter and oxidized minerals. According to an analysis by Wuqing County, niter soil contains 0.44% nitrogen, 0.25% phosphorus, and 1.76% potassium, as well as chlorides and sulfates, making it a good raw material for fertilizer production. The method for making fertilizer from niter soil is as follows: First, soak the swept-up niter soil in water to leach it into a brownish-yellow niter solution of about 25 degrees (Baumé hydrometer, hereinafter the same). When leaching, if it is in the cold winter, it is necessary to enclose the leaching pool with straw to maintain a certain temperature. After the niter solution is leached, it can be put into a pot and heated. When it is heated to 38 to 40 degrees Celsius, some crystalline niter will come out of the pot. After the niter salt is scooped out, continue to heat it to 40 to 50 degrees Celsius, then stop the heat. At this time, the potassium nitrate that precipitates to the bottom of the pot is the potassium nitrate, and the remaining brown brine is the niter brine.

Potassium nitrate is a fast-acting nitrogen-potassium fertilizer (mainly nitrogen), suitable for use as top dressing, with high fertilizer efficiency. Niter brine also contains a certain amount of nitrogen and potassium nutrients. (Technical Bureau of Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry)

    用硝土制氮钾混合肥
    硝土是一种含有丰富硝酸态氮素的表土，是含有机物质及氧化矿物质的产物。据武清县分析：硝土含氮0.44％，磷0.25％，钾1.76％，并含有氯化物及硫酸盐类，是制造肥料的好原料。硝土制肥的方法是：把扫回来的硝土先用水浸淋成二十五度（波美比重计，以下同）左右的棕黄色硝水。浸淋时，如在严冬需用稻草等物把淋池围好，保持一定温度。硝水淋好后，即可放入锅内加火，熬制到摄氏三十八度至四十度时，锅里就出来一部分结晶状的硝盐，把硝盐捞出后，继续加火熬到四十度至五十度时，就可停火，此时沉淀到锅底的就是硝酸钾，剩下的褐色卤水就是硝卤水。
    硝酸钾是速效性氮钾肥（以氮为主），适用作追肥，肥效很高；硝卤水也含有一定数量的氮素及钾素养分。（河北省农林厅技术局）
