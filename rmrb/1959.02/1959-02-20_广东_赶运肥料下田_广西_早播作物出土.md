    Guangdong – Rush Fertilizer to the Fields
    Guangxi – Early-Sown Crops Emerge
    (Our Dispatch from Guangzhou, February 19) The season for spring plowing and rice transplanting in Guangdong Province is rapidly approaching.
    Currently, over 6.3 million people across the province are engaged in accumulating and transporting fertilizer, having accumulated over 48 billion dan of various fertilizers. More than half of the fertilizer needed for early-season crops has already been delivered to the fields. In the Foshan Special District these past few days, over 130,000 handcarts, ox-carts, large carts, and over 100,000 boats of various sizes have been crisscrossing the fields and waterways, continuously delivering fertilizer to the fields. Many communes in Zhongshan County have launched a "Thousand-Boat" fertilizer delivery campaign. Wengyuan County has achieved "vehicle and boat transportation in the plains, aerial cable transportation in the mountains" for fertilizer delivery. Over 70% of the more than 900 million dan of fertilizer accumulated in the county has quickly been delivered to the fields. Tangping Commune in Liangyang County has repaired over 2,000 large and small roads, totaling over 2,800 li, ensuring that there are roads to every paddy field and that every road is accessible to vehicles, basically eliminating the need for carrying fertilizer by shoulder.
    This year, spring plowing and rice transplanting in Guangdong will be one or two solar terms earlier than in previous years. Right after the Spring Festival, tasks such as sowing, cultivating seedlings, irrigating fields, and preparing land have all piled up. In order to seize the season and gain the initiative in spring plowing, people's communes in various localities have fully utilized the superiority of unified labor arrangement. Luoping Commune in Luoding County, through checking the season, checking the progress, and checking the labor force, divided the entire commune into various specialized teams, conducting assembly-line operations of delivering fertilizer, irrigating, and harrowing. While carrying out large-scale specialized fertilizer delivery, many communes also combined it with "guerrilla warfare," stipulating that every laborer, regardless of the agricultural work they are doing, must bring fertilizer to the fields when they go to work.

    (Our Dispatch from Nanning, February 19) A bustling scene of spring plowing and sowing is unfolding across the vast fields of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. As of the 12th, the autonomous region has planted 1.89 million mu of crops such as spring corn, buckwheat, and sugarcane, and soaked over 28 million jin of early rice seeds. The first batch of sown corn and early rice has sprouted lush green seedlings, already four or five cun high. Lines of carts and horses transporting fertilizer are a common sight, and piles of fertilizer are scattered across the fields like chess pieces. The sound of farmers cracking whips and urging cattle, along with the melodious mountain songs, blends into a delightful symphony of spring plowing production.
    Since last winter, Guangxi has prepared a solid material foundation for spring plowing production. The entire region has deep-plowed 18 million mu of farmland, accumulated 9.6 billion dan of fertilizer, and 12 million mu of farmland has better water conservancy guarantees. Fine seeds have been basically prepared. The sowing season in various localities is generally one to two solar terms earlier than in previous years. All localities in the region will complete the sowing of early rice around the time of Rain Water or Awakening of Insects.
    This year, various localities in the autonomous region have also paid attention to grasping the promotion of fine seeds and technical measures centered on rational close planting, in order to fully implement the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." Seedlings have been checked in places that have already been sown in order to strengthen seedling nursing work. Rong County conducted a major inspection of sowing standards and quality last month. When it was discovered that some rice seedling fields were not well managed, responsibility systems of field-head stake marking and dedicated management were promptly established. Dongfanghong Commune in Luchuan County also promptly conducted field-head consultations, identified each plot, analyzed the situation, and promptly carried out drainage, watering, and topdressing. People's communes in various localities have generally summarized the experience of last year's bumper harvest, riding the waves, and a region-wide spring plowing production competition is vigorously unfolding.

    广东——赶运肥料下田
    广西——早播作物出土
    本报广州19日电　广东省春耕插秧季节已迫近眉睫。
    现在，全省投入积肥送肥的有六百三十多万人，积造各种肥料四百八十多亿担，早造作物的肥料已有半数以上送下田里。这几天，佛山专区有十三万多架手推车、牛拉车、大板车和十万多艘大小船艇，在田野、河道上纵横驰骋，源源不断地把肥料送到田去。中山县许多公社开展了“千儎艇”送肥运动。翁源县送肥实现“平原车船化，山地天线化”，全县积到的九亿多担肥，很快便有七成多送到田中。两阳县的塘坪公社修好了长达二千八百多里的大小道路共二千多条，做到垌垌有路，路路通车，送肥基本消灭了肩挑。
    今年，广东的春耕插秧要比往年提早一、两个节气。春节一过，播种、育秧、灌田、整地等各项工作都挤上来了。为了抢季节，争得春耕的主动权，各地人民公社充分发挥了公社统一安排劳力的优越性。罗定县罗平公社通过查季节、查进度、查劳力，全公社分成各项专业队，边送肥、边灌水、边耙田，进行流水作业。许多公社在进行大兵团专业送肥的同时，还结合“游击战”，每个劳动力出勤时无论干什么农活，都规定了带肥下田的任务。　　　　　　　　　　　（黎作骥）
    本报南宁19日电　广西僮族自治区的广大田野上，呈现一幅繁忙的春耕播种景象。到12日止，自治区已种春玉米、荞麦、甘蔗等作物一百八十九万亩，早稻浸种二千八百多万斤。第一批播种的玉米、早稻吐出了青翠幼苗，已长四、五寸高。运肥的车马成群，肥堆正如棋子布满田野，农民拍鞭催牛和嘹亮的山歌声汇成动听的春耕生产交响曲。
    自去冬以来，广西已为春耕生产准备了雄厚的物质基础。全区深耕田地一千八百万亩，积肥九十六亿担，一千二百万亩田有了较好的水利保证，良种基本备齐。各地播种季节，一般比往年提早一个到两个节令。全区各地，都将在雨水或惊蛰前后播完早稻。
    今年，自治区各地还注意了抓好推广良种和以合理密植为中心的技术措施，以求全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”。已经播种的地方，都及时进行检查，以加强育秧护理工作。容县在上个月开展了一次播种规格质量大检查，发现有的秧田管理不好，便及时建立了田头插签，专人管理的责任制度。陆川县东方红公社也及时进行田头会诊，逐块鉴定，分别情况，及时进行排水，淋水、追肥。各地人民公社普遍总结了去年大丰产的经验，乘风破浪，一个全区性的春耕生产大竞赛正在蓬勃展开。（黄绍进）（附图片）
