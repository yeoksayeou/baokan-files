From Jilin: A million people in Jilin Province are engaged in collecting, producing, and delivering fertilizer simultaneously, initially forming a mass upsurge.

    Following the call by Wu De, First Secretary of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, on January 21, at a telephone conference, urging the province to immediately launch a mass campaign for manure collection, fertilizer production, and delivery, various localities acted swiftly and with great momentum. Within ten days, the number of participants in the movement exceeded one million, accounting for a quarter of the province's total rural labor force.
    Currently, the first secretaries of various city and county Party committees have taken the lead in overseeing fertilizer work, with committee members dividing up responsibilities by area and organizing a large number of cadres to go deep into the countryside to participate in the leadership of the manure collection movement. In Yongji County, on the first day that the first secretary and county committee members went to the villages to lead and participate in the manure collection movement, the number of participants in the county surged from 13,700 to 36,700. Currently, six secretaries of the Yongji County Committee are directing operations on-site, with the first secretary responsible for inspecting the manure collection situation throughout the county, and the other five secretaries responsible for specific areas. After the First Secretary of Yanji County led more than 170 cadres to go deep into various communes, the county universally adopted the "six fixings" (fixed manpower, tools, quantity, quality, time, and labor compensation), "three implementations" (tasks assigned to management areas, production teams, and individuals), and "four comparisons" (comparing enthusiasm, measures, quantity, and quality) to accelerate the progress of manure collection throughout the county. By the end of January, the county had mobilized more than 50% of its labor force, built 141 local fertilizer plants, and laid wooden rails and manufactured thousands of sledges and handcarts to speed up fertilizer transportation.
    In the midst of the vigorous manure collection, fertilizer production, and delivery movement, many cadres from Jilin Province's government offices, students, and urban residents are also actively participating. In the Tonghua area alone, more than 50,000 cadres from government offices, students, and urban residents participated in manure collection. The directly affiliated organs of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture had 3,475 cadres who collected 304 tons of manure in two days. Many cadres and students in Siping and Changchun have proposed individual manure collection and fertilizer production targets, and they are doing everything possible to collect fertilizer to support the countryside in achieving even greater harvests.

    This newspaper reports: This year, Jiaohe County plans to apply 20,000 jin of various kinds of farm manure and 1,000 jin of locally produced and imported chemical fertilizers per mu of land in phases. Currently, the manure collection armies in various localities, braving the sub-zero 20-degree weather, are enthusiastically working in the snow-covered fields, and the amount of manure collected is rapidly increasing. Recently, the Jiaohe County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China inspected the quality of fertilizer throughout the county and found that among the more than 39 million tons of manure collected, 750,000 tons of sod did not meet the quality requirements. The County Party Committee has resolutely removed this sod from the total amount of manure collected.
    This inspection has changed the local farmers' habit of using sod as a substitute for fertilizer and guided people's enthusiasm for manure collection onto the right track. Sod is still soil, and it takes a lot of labor to transport it to the fields, but it does not have the effect of fertilizing the land. Now, under the leadership of the County Party Committee, the people of Jiaohe County are vigorously collecting human and animal manure, poultry manure, miscellaneous manure, and digging peat.
    To improve the quality of fertilizer, 114 local fertilizer plants have been restored and newly built throughout the county, producing more than 3,100 tons of local fertilizer.
    The Jiaohe County's inspection of fertilizer quality has further strengthened the confidence of commune members in striving for high yields. The Second Brigade of the Xinzhan Management Area has taken the lead in achieving the target of applying 20,000 jin of fertilizer per mu.

    吉林百万人搞积肥造肥
    蛟河严格检查质量提高群众积肥积极性
    本报长春4日电　吉林省积肥、造肥和送肥齐头并进，初步形成全民性的高潮。
    1月21日，中共吉林省委第一书记吴德在电话会议上，号召全省立即掀起全民性积肥、造肥和送肥高潮后，各地行动快，声势猛，十天之内参加运动的人数已突破一百万人，占全省农村总劳动力的四分之一。
    目前，各市、县委第一书记已挂帅抓肥料，党委委员分片包干，并组织大批干部深入农村，参加了积肥运动的领导。永吉县在第一书记和县委委员分头下乡领导和参加积肥运动的第一天，全县参加运动的人数，由一万三千七百人猛增到三万六千七百人。现在永吉县委有六位书记在现场指挥，第一书记负责巡回检查全县积肥情况，其他五名书记分片负责。延吉县第一书记带领一百七十多名干部深入各公社以后，全县普遍采取了“六固定”（固定人力、工具、数量、质量、时间和劳动报酬）、“三落实”（任务落到管理区、生产队和个人）、“四比”（比干劲、措施、数量和质量）的办法，加快了全县的积肥进度，到1月底，全县已动员50％以上的劳动力，建成了一百四十一个土化肥厂，另外铺设木轨和制成了上千台爬犁、手推车来加快运肥速度。
    在热火朝天的积肥、造肥和送肥运动中，吉林省许多机关干部、学生和城镇居民也积极行动起来。仅通化地区参加积肥的机关干部、学生和城镇居民就达五万多人。延边朝鲜族自治州直属机关有三千四百七十五名干部，在两天内积肥三百零四吨。四平和长春的许多干部和学生，都提出个人积肥造肥指标，他们正千方百计地收集肥料，支援农村获得更大的丰收。（金昌范）
    本报讯　今年蛟河县计划每亩土地分期施各种农家肥料两万斤，土洋化肥一千斤。现在各地积肥大军，冒着零下二十度的严寒，在冰天雪地的田野里热情地劳动，积肥数量迅速增加。最近中共蛟河县委在全县范围内检查了肥料质量，发现全县已积的三千九百多万吨粪肥中，有七十五万吨草皮土不合质量要求。县委已坚决把这些草皮土从积肥总量中剔除。
    经过这次检查，改变了当地农民用草皮土代替肥料的习惯，把人们的积肥积极性引导到正确的道路上来。草皮土仍是土，花很多劳力运到地里，起不到肥田作用。现在，蛟河县人民在县委的领导下，正在大力积攒人畜粪尿、鸡鸭粪、杂肥和挖掘草炭。
    为了提高肥料质量，全县已恢复和新建土化肥厂一百十四座，生产出土化肥三千一百多吨。
    蛟河县对肥料质量的检查，还进一步坚定了公社社员争取高额增产的信心。新站管理区第二大队已首先达到了每亩施肥两万斤的指标。
