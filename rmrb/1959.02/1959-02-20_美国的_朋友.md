    America's "Friends"
    Lin Mo Han

    It is said that the US government will change its methods of foreign propaganda starting this year. How will it change? It will "talk less about military affairs, talk more about culture, make friends, and influence people's hearts," and so on. This is what George Allen, director of the United States Information Agency, told a group of New York listeners not long ago.

    Why is it that at this particular moment, the US rulers suddenly want to put on a civilized appearance and talk about "culture" and "friendship"? The reason is simple: the US policy of war threats and military intervention has already run into trouble and lost the hearts of the people everywhere. The flames of opposition to US aggression are burning not only in Asia and Africa, but also in Latin America. This situation has forced the "American wolf" to temporarily find a sheepskin to cover up his overly exposed teeth.

    However, people are not so easily fooled. They have either directly experienced the taste of American "friendship" and "culture," which are nothing more than euphemisms for "plunder" and "corruption." There is also a very simple way to distinguish between friends and enemies, and that is to see who they are in league with. For a long time, American imperialists have persistently pursued a policy of supporting all the most brutal, dark, and corrupt dictatorships remaining in the world, treating them as their pawns, giving them money and guns, and allowing them to continue to ride on the necks of the people and suck their blood. These fellows are, without exception, traitors and betrayers of the people of all countries, and are enemies deeply hated by the people of all countries. And when the people rise up to resist this dark rule, the US government brutally interferes and suppresses them. One newspaper – "America Daily" – said that the United States is a "friend of all dictators," which is correct. Therefore, American imperialists cannot get anything other than hatred and disgust from the people of the world.

    Even the US bourgeois press has had to admit this. An article in the November 1958 issue of the American magazine "Harper's" was titled "Why Doesn't Latin America Trust Us?" It stated: "Trujillo (the dictator of the Dominican Republic) is not the only dictator in Latin America who relies on US military aid to maintain his power acquired by force. He is merely the first such dictator, and the one who has maintained it for the longest time." The article also said: "The excuse for implementing military aid programs is that these programs can strengthen continental defenses and prevent possible communist attacks. It is truly astonishing that such an argument can be put forward with a straight face. If the Soviet Union wanted to occupy ports on the South American Pacific coast, would we be able to stop them with the old-fashioned gunboats, outdated submarines, old-style aircraft, and our surplus howitzers that we ship to the region?" This "example" is certainly inappropriate. But the author hits the nail on the head and exposes the US's mask!

    The US rulers are thus searching through garbage dumps everywhere for those lackeys they can use, arming them to the teeth, in order to maintain the already tottering and notorious colonial system. For example, in Cuba, during the two years when Carlos Prío Socarrás was president, US so-called "military aid" to Cuba was less than $150,000. But during the same two-year period after the US-backed bloodthirsty executioner Batista came to power, the US gave almost twelve times the above amount in "military aid." No wonder their American masters were so saddened and wailed when Batista fell and the henchmen of the Batista dictatorship were justly sentenced to death by the Cuban people.

    Perhaps some will say: Although the United States has lost the hearts of the people all over the world, there are still a small number of dictatorial rulers who can be counted as friends of the United States. But who doesn't know that the relationship between these dictators and the American imperialists is that of master and servant? There can be no real friendship between master and servant. As long as the servant shows a little disrespect to the master, the master will try to replace him. This is one of the reasons why American imperialists are constantly creating palace coups everywhere.

    As for the people? They will not forget the old fable: A snake crawled up to a farmer and said, "Neighbor, let's be friends! Now you don't have to worry about me hurting you. Look, I've completely changed. Since spring, I've put on this beautiful new skin!" But no amount of feigned honesty can fool the farmer. The farmer said, "That's right. You've changed your skin, but the heart inside is still malicious!" So the farmer drove away this hypocritical fellow.

    The American imperialists' encounter is the same as the snake's encounter. Wherever they go, such voices are heard: "Yankee go home!"

### 美国的“朋友”

    美国的“朋友”
    林默涵
    据说美国政府从今年起要改变对外宣传的方法了。怎么改变法呢？就是“少谈军事，多谈文化，结交朋友，影响人心”云云。这是美国新闻署署长乔治·艾伦不久以前向一群纽约的听众讲的。
    为什么偏偏在这个时候，美国统治者忽然想装出一副斯文的样子，谈起什么“文化”和“友情”来了呢？原因很简单，就是由于美国的战争恫吓和军事干涉政策，已经在世界各地大触霉头，失尽人心。反对美国侵略的火焰，不但在亚洲、非洲，也在拉丁美洲普遍地燃烧起来了。这种局面，就迫得“美国野心狼”不得不暂且找一张羊皮来遮盖一下他的露得太长的牙齿了。
    但是，人们并不是那样容易上当的。他们或者直接领教过美国的“友谊”和“文化”的滋味，那无非是“掠夺”和“腐蚀”的代用语。还有一个辨别友敌的最简单的方法，就是看看他是跟谁在一伙的。长期以来，美国帝国主义者坚持不渝地执行一种政策，就是给世界上尚存的一切最残暴、最黑暗、最腐朽的独裁统治者以支持，把他们当作自己的爪牙，给他们金钱和枪炮，使他们继续骑在人民的脖子上吸血吮髓。这些家伙，无例外地都是各国人民的叛徒、卖国贼，是各国人民深恶痛绝的仇敌。而当人民起来反抗这种黑暗统治的时候，美国政府就横暴地加以干涉和镇压。有一家报纸——“美洲日报”说，美国是一切“独裁统治者的朋友”，这话说得对，因此美国帝国主义者除了从全世界人民得到仇恨和憎恶之外，是什么也不可能得到的。
    这一点，就连美国资产阶级的报刊上也不得不招认了。美国“哈泼斯”杂志1958年11月号上刊载了一篇文章，题目叫“为什么拉丁美洲不信任我们？”其中说道：“特鲁希略（多米尼加的独裁者）并不是拉丁美洲唯一靠美国的军事援助来维持他用武力取得的政权的独裁者。他不过是第一个这样的独裁者，而且时间维持得最久而已。”这篇文章还说：“执行军事援助计划的借口，是这些计划能加强大陆的防务，预防可能发生的共产主义袭击。这样一种论调居然可以老着脸皮提出来，实在令人惊讶不已。假如苏联要想占领南美太平洋沿岸的港口，用我们运送给这个地区的老式炮舰、过时的潜水艇、旧式飞机和我们剩余的榴弹炮，难道就能够阻止吗？”这个“例如”当然是不恰当的。但作者却一语破的，揭穿了美国的假面具！
    美国统治者就是这样地从各处的垃圾堆里寻找出那些可以供他们驱遣的走狗，把他们全副武装起来，以便维持那已经摇摇欲坠的恶名昭彰的殖民制度。比如古巴，在卡洛斯·普里奥当总统的两年中，美国对古巴的所谓“军事援助”不到十五万美元，而当美国所豢养的血腥刽子手巴蒂斯塔上台以后同样两年的时间内，美国所给予的“军事援助”却几乎达到上述数目的十二倍。怪不得当巴蒂斯塔垮台，而巴蒂斯塔独裁者的走狗们被古巴人民公正地判处死刑时，他们的美国主子会那样伤心哀嚎了。
    也许有人说：美国虽然在全世界失尽了人心，但究竟还有一小撮独裁统治者算得上是美国的朋友。但是，谁不知道，这些独裁者同美国帝国主义者的关系，是主子和奴才的关系，在主子和奴才之间，是不可能有什么真正的友谊的。只要奴才对主子表现一点不恭顺，主子就要想办法把他换掉，这就是美帝国主义者所以到处不断制造宫廷政变的原因之一。
  至于人民呢？他们是不会忘记那个古老的寓言的：一条蛇爬到农民跟前，说道：“邻居，咱们来交个朋友吧！现在你不用担心我要伤害你了。你瞧，我已经彻底改变了。自从春天以来，我就换上了这一身漂亮的新皮啦！”可是一切假装的老实都不能叫农民上当。农民说：“一点不错。你已经换了新皮了，可是里边的心却依旧是恶毒的呵！”于是农民就把这个假冒为善的家伙赶跑了。
    美国帝国主义者的遭遇也和这条蛇的遭遇一样，走到哪里，哪里就响起了这样的声音：“美国佬滚出去！”
