Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, February 7th: According to a live recording broadcast by Iraqi radio on the evening of February 7th, the Iraqi Supreme Special Military Tribunal has sentenced the conspirator and former Deputy Prime Minister Arif to death in a secret trial on February 5th.

The court made this judgment based on Article 11 of Government Law No. 15 of 1935 during martial law. This clause stipulates that anyone who takes up any kind of weapon against the government or government representatives shall be sentenced to death. The military court applied this clause based on the power granted by Prime Minister Qasim, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. Prime Minister Qasim, in his letter to the court, authorized the court to "try the defendant according to any clause it deems applicable to the defendant's actions."

The military court further stated that Prime Minister Qasim embodied the authority of the government during the state of war because "he is the leader of the country, the Prime Minister, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, and the Minister of Defense. Therefore, the aforementioned clause is fully applicable to the defendant."

However, the Supreme Special Military Tribunal appropriately considered the role played by the defendant in the revolution and the enthusiasm shown in the struggle against the old regime. Therefore, the court left the issue of lenient treatment of the criminal to the sole leader of the country to decide with his own wisdom and benevolence. According to legal provisions, the sole leader of the country has the right to mitigate the court's judgment or announce a complete pardon.

At the end of the trial, the presiding judge shouted slogans such as "Long live the Republic," "Long live Prime Minister Qasim, the leader of the Republic," and "Long live the Arab nation."

    伊拉克最高特别军事法庭
    判处阴谋分子阿里夫死刑
    新华社巴格达7日电　据伊拉克电台7日晚上广播的实况录音，伊拉克最高特别军事法庭已经在2月5日的秘密审讯中判处阴谋分子、前副总理阿里夫死刑。
    法庭是根据戒严期间政府1935年第十五号法律的第十一条作出这个判决的。这项条款规定：凡是拿起任何种类的武器反对政府或政府代表的人一律处以死刑。军事法庭根据武装部队总司令卡塞姆总理授予的权力应用了这一条款。卡塞姆总理在他给法庭的信中授权法庭“根据它认为适用于被告的行为的任何条款审判被告。”
    军事法庭又说，卡塞姆总理在战争状态时期体现着政府的权威，因为“他是国家的领袖，总理，武装部队总司令和国防部长。因此，上述条款完全适用于被告”。
    但是，最高特别军事法庭适当地考虑了被告在革命中所起的作用和在反对旧政权的斗争中所表现的热情，因此法庭把对罪犯宽大处理的问题让国家的唯一领袖以自己的智慧和仁慈来决定，根据法律规定，国家的唯一领袖有权减轻法庭的判决，或宣布完全赦免。
    审判结束时，庭长高呼“共和国万岁”、“共和国领袖卡塞姆总理万岁”和“阿拉伯民族万岁”等口号。
