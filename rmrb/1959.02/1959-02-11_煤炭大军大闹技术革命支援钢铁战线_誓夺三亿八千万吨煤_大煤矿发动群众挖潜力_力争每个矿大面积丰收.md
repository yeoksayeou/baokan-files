Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: To ensure the fulfillment and overfulfillment of the production target of 380 million tons of raw coal this year, the Ministry of Coal Industry has recently formulated a series of measures. These measures stipulate that this year, China's coal industry will further mobilize the masses to deeply engage in the technical revolution, tap the production potential of existing enterprises, accelerate the construction of continued mines, coal washing plants, and southern coal bases, and rapidly increase the output of coking coal and coal washing capacity to ensure that it meets the needs of the "Great Leap Forward" of the steel marshal and other aspects.

    Large-scale coal mines are the backbone of China's coal industry. This year, they bear a large proportion of the national coal production task. Therefore, strengthening the leadership of large-scale coal mines has a decisive impact on the completion of this year's coal production task. Although the production capacity of these large-scale coal mines has been greatly improved through a series of mass movements last year, there is still great production potential in each mine because the high-yield experience of many coal mining faces and mines has not yet been fully promoted. For example, for the same medium-thick coal seam working face, some can produce an average of more than 1,000 tons per day, and the highest can reach more than 2,000 tons; while most working faces in the country can only produce about 300 tons per day. Therefore, while enabling a large number of newly built mines to be put into production as early as possible, vigorously promoting the experience of high-yield working faces, and enabling each mine to achieve a large-scale bumper harvest are the main measures for increasing production in large-scale coal mines and one of the important contents of the technical revolution. To achieve this measure, the Ministry of Coal Industry has sent three working groups to Jiaozuo, Kailuan, Fengfeng and other mines to summarize the experience of high yield and organizing large-scale bumper harvests. The ministry has also formulated average advanced quotas for various types of coal seams. According to calculations, as long as 20% of the working faces of existing mines reach this average advanced quota, 2 million tons of raw coal can be produced additionally each month.

    This year, China's steel output will increase by more than 7 million tons compared with last year, and the output of pig iron for casting and forging will also increase significantly. This requires the coal industry to supply more coking washed coal. At present, the Ministry of Coal Industry is starting from two aspects, increasing the production of coking raw coal and expanding the coal washing capacity, to vigorously increase the production of coking washed coal. All bases that produce coking coal will undergo large-scale reconstruction and expansion this year, especially coal mines such as Fengfeng, Pingdingshan, Luan, and Zixing, which produce primary coking coal, will significantly increase their coking coal output this year. In terms of coal washing, in addition to accelerating the construction progress of the 13 coal washing plants under construction and tapping the potential of existing coal washing plants, the ministry has listed the construction of simple coal washing plants with less investment and quick results as the primary task of the current coal industry. It is initially decided to build more than 100 simple coal washing plants in the first half of the year. The ministry has established a special coal washing office to strengthen the leadership of this work, and the Coal Washing Design Institute is also accelerating the preparation of design documents.

    In order to gradually change the unbalanced distribution of China's old coal bases and enable steel and other industries to obtain fuel nearby, another task of the coal industry this year is to establish coal bases in the south to reduce the transportation burden of a large number of northern coal needing to be transferred to the south. At present, the Ministry of Coal Industry has determined that the policy for mine construction this year is: while fully tapping the production potential of various old mining areas in the north and building some new mines in the old mining areas, it will concentrate necessary investment, equipment, and materials as much as possible to accelerate the construction of new coal bases in the south, and strive to make the coal production of each economic cooperation zone basically self-sufficient in a short period of time. According to the arrangement, several new coal mines will soon begin large-scale construction in southern provinces, including Fengcheng in Jiangxi, Puqi in Hubei, and Nanling in Guangdong. These new coalfields have abundant reserves and good coal quality, and most of the coal types can be used for coking. Now, the Ministry of Coal Industry and relevant provinces are concentrating necessary geological forces to accelerate the exploration of the storage of coal resources in these bases. The northern coal bases are also transferring forces to support the construction of new bases.

    In terms of small coal kilns, more than 100,000 small coal kilns have been developed across the country last year, which will play an important role in supplying civilian fuel and local industrial coal for this year. The policy of the coal industry for developing small coal kilns this year is to consolidate and improve on the basis of past large-scale development. Generally, small coal kilns basically use improved tools. For those small coal kilns with abundant burial volume, convenient transportation, and greater development prospects, and which produce coking coal, a batch will be selected for technical transformation to gradually improve working conditions and increase coal output.

    Now, the above-mentioned guidelines and measures formulated by the Ministry of Coal Industry have begun to be implemented in various mines. A mass movement even more magnificent than in 1958 has begun to take shape in many coal mines. In order to ensure the victorious completion of the 380 million-ton coal production task, the mines are also mobilizing the masses to summarize experience, further strengthen enterprise management, and formulate new leap forward plans. The Ministry of Coal Industry is also preparing to convene a national cadre meeting of the national coal industry system in the near future to systematically summarize and exchange the production and construction experience of 1958 and formulate more practical and feasible specific measures for a greater leap forward this year.

    煤炭大军大闹技术革命支援钢铁战线
    誓夺三亿八千万吨煤
　　大煤矿发动群众挖潜力  力争每个矿大面积丰收
    新华社10日讯　煤炭工业部为保证今年完成和超额完成三亿八千万吨原煤的生产任务，最近拟订了一系列的措施。这些措施规定，今年我国煤炭工业将进一步深入发动群众大闹技术革命，挖掘现有企业的生产潜力，加速续建矿井、洗煤厂和南方煤炭基地的建设，迅速增加炼焦煤的产量和洗煤能力，以保证满足钢铁元帅大跃进和其它方面的需要。
    大型煤矿是我国煤炭工业的骨干。今年它们担负全国煤炭生产任务的比重很大。因此，加强大型煤矿的领导，对完成今年的煤炭生产任务有着决定性的作用。这些大型煤矿经过去年一系列的群众运动，生产能力虽有很大提高，但是由于许多采煤工作面和矿井的高产经验还没有全面推广，目前各矿还有很大的生产潜力。例如，同样是中厚煤层的工作面，有的平均日产量可达一千吨以上，最高的达两千多吨；而全国大多数工作面每天却只能产三百吨左右。因此，在使大批新建矿井能及早投入生产的同时，大力推广高产工作面的经验，使每个矿都能大面积丰收，是大型煤矿增产的主要措施，也是技术革命的重要内容之一。为了实现这一措施，煤炭工业部已经派出三个工作组，分赴焦作、开滦、峰峰等矿，总结高产和组织大面积丰收的经验。这个部还制定各类煤层平均先进定额。据计算，只要有20％的现有矿井的工作面达到这个平均先进定额，每月就可以增产二百万吨原煤。
    今年我国钢产量要比去年提高七百多万吨，同时供铸锻用的生铁也要增产很多，这就要求煤炭工业供应更多的炼焦洗煤。目前煤炭工业部正在从增产炼焦原煤和扩大洗煤能力两方面着手，大力增产炼焦洗煤。凡是生产炼焦煤的基地，今年都将进行大规模的改建扩建，特别是像生产主焦煤的峰峰、平顶山、潞安、资兴等煤矿，今年的炼焦煤产量都将大量增加。在洗煤方面，这个部除了正在加快正在建设的十三个洗煤厂的施工进度和挖掘现有的洗煤厂的潜力外，并把建设投资少、收效快的简易洗煤厂列为当前煤炭工业的首要任务。初步决定在上半年就要建成简易洗煤厂一百多个。这个部已经成立了专门的洗煤办公室，来加强对这项工作的领导，洗煤设计院也正在加快编制设计文件。
    为了逐步改变我国旧有煤炭基地分布不平衡的状况，使钢铁和其他工业能够就近取得燃料，今年煤炭工业另一项任务是将在南方建立煤炭基地，减轻大批北方煤需要向南调运的运输负担。目前煤炭工业部确定今年矿井建设的方针是：在充分挖掘北方各老矿区的生产潜力，和在老矿区建设一些新矿井的同时，将尽可能集中必要的投资、设备和材料，快马加鞭地在南方建设新的煤炭基地，争取在短时期内，使各经济协作区的煤炭生产都能基本上达到自给。根据安排，最近南方各省即将开始大规模建设的新煤矿，有江西丰城、湖北蒲圻、广东南岭等好几个。这些新煤田的储量丰富，煤质好，绝大部分煤种可以用来炼焦炭。现在，煤炭工业部与有关各省正在集中必要的地质力量，加速探明这些基地煤炭资源的储存情况。北方各煤炭基地还抽调力量支援新基地的建设。
    在小煤窑方面，去年全国发展的小煤窑已达十万多个，这对于各地自力更生地供应今年的民用燃料和地方工业用煤将起重要作用。今年煤炭工业对发展小煤窑的方针是在过去大量发展的基础上进行巩固和提高。一般的小煤窑基本上是改良工具，对那些埋藏量丰富、交通方便、发展前途较大而又生产焦煤的小煤窑，将选择一批在技术上予以改造，以逐步改善劳动条件和提高煤炭产量。
    现在，煤炭工业部制定的上述各项方针措施已在各矿开始贯彻。一个比1958年更加宏伟的群众运动，也已经在许多煤矿开始形成。为了保证胜利完成三亿八千万吨产煤任务，各矿还正在发动群众总结经验，进一步加强企业管理和制定新的跃进计划。煤炭工业部也准备在最近召开全国煤炭工业系统的全国干部会议，系统地总结与交流1958年的生产建设经验，为今年更大的跃进制定更加切实可行的具体措施。（附图片）
