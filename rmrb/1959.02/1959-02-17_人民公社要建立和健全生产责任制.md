People's Communes Must Establish and Improve the Production Responsibility System

The leap forward targets for agricultural production set by the Party Central Committee for this year are a great and arduous task. To accomplish this task, in addition to continuing to oppose right-leaning conservative thinking, break down superstitions, liberate thought, muster full energy, and strive for the upstream, there must be a series of corresponding measures. Establishing and improving the production responsibility system is one of the most important of these measures.

A socialist economy is a planned economy. Establishing a production responsibility system is to ensure the completion of national plans and commune plans. The production responsibility system is a basic principle of industrial management and also a basic principle of agricultural management. With this system, first of all, the phenomenon of no one being responsible in production will be eliminated, and the realization of various indicators will be guaranteed. Furthermore, because this system clearly stipulates the scope of work, work responsibilities, work tasks, and their nature for any worker on the production front, and clearly stipulates the responsible units and personnel for each job or each production and each machine or each piece of land, this can encourage each unit and each person to better complete and overfulfill their tasks. People's communes should gradually establish a strict responsibility system. In this way, it is not merely a general proposal and organization for everyone to complete these tasks based on the national plan and commune plan, generally proposing how much agricultural development, how much industrial development, and how much forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery development should be achieved, but also the various indicators and measures can be specifically allocated to the management area, production team, and even the commune members, guaranteeing responsible completion. Of course, this does not mean that with a responsibility system, the phenomenon of wasting materials and labor will never happen again, and the phenomenon of not completing the plan will never occur again. However, with a responsibility system, this phenomenon can be reduced, and when these phenomena occur, it is also easy to find the causes, improve them, and catch up.

Large-scale collaboration, also known as "large-scale corps operations," was widely used last autumn. This is an effective form of labor organization and production method. Many communes have carried out the autumn harvest quickly, plowed the land quickly and deeply, and planted wheat in a timely manner, and small blast furnaces blossomed everywhere because they adopted this method. However, the necessity of the production responsibility system must not be denied because of this. Last year's practice has proved that "large-scale corps operations" can only be a temporary labor organization form and production method for shock work, because most agricultural activities are only suitable for establishing regular professional production teams and comprehensive production teams. Therefore, the commune should focus on regular professional production teams and comprehensive production teams, combined with the necessary labor and mutually supportive collaboration. This requires a clear responsibility system. Moreover, even in large-scale collaboration and large-scale corps operations, the responsibility system is still an indispensable system. With the establishment of a responsibility system, each production team and each commune member has a clear scope of work and work responsibilities, which can avoid or reduce the phenomenon of "idle work" and improve labor efficiency.

The establishment of a production responsibility system is conducive to commune members mastering and rapidly improving production technology and becoming experts. This is because a person who manages a production for a long time will understand all aspects of this production and master all the technology of this production. Of course, this does not prevent them from learning and familiarizing themselves with other aspects of production technology in addition to being familiar with the production technology of their own posts, that is, becoming "all-rounders" and "omnipotent people," rice planting experts who also understand cotton planting technology, and farmers who grow crops who also understand tool manufacturing technology.... However, to become an "all-rounder" and "omnipotent person," one must learn one by one, first familiarize oneself with the production technology of one's own post, do a good job in the production of one's own post, and then gradually familiarize oneself with other aspects of production technology; otherwise, one cannot become an expert, nor can one become an "all-rounder" or "omnipotent person."

There are many different ways of establishing a production responsibility system. Judging from the situation in many places, a collective responsibility system and individual responsibility system of "tasks assigned to the team, management assigned to the group, measures assigned to the field, responsibilities assigned to the person, and inspection and acceptance" should be established. The commune should generally implement a "four fix, one reward system" for the management area (brigade) and production team, that is, according to the overall plan of the entire commune, determine the annual output, measures, investment, labor, and management personnel of various crops and various productions, and give rewards for those who overfulfill the targets, and give criticism and education, and even necessary punishment, to those who fail to complete the targets due to poor management. Of course, due to different circumstances, some people's communes can also implement a "three fix, one reward system," or a "six fix, one reward system," or a "three contract" (contracting output, contracting work, contracting investment) system.

Not only is it necessary to implement a responsibility system in agricultural production, but also in the commune's industry, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fishery, and service industries. From the fields and workshops to the canteens and nurseries, work must be carried out in an orderly manner according to predetermined plans and quotas.

The production responsibility system of the people's commune must be established on the basis of the commune members' high degree of labor consciousness. Without the commune members' labor consciousness, the responsibility system cannot be established; even if it is reluctantly established, it will not have much effect. The purpose of establishing a responsibility system is to fully exert rather than restrain the commune members' labor enthusiasm. As a commune member said: "Only when I understand my responsibility can I exert all my strength." The fact that the "August 1st" Commune in Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, established a responsibility system on the basis of mass consciousness, as reported in this newspaper on January 15, proves this point. After the "August 1st" Commune implemented the responsibility system, the commune members clearly understood their production tasks, and their labor enthusiasm was greatly increased. Within two months, 80% of the task of building water conservancy projects was completed; the amount of manure accumulated was also two-thirds more than in the same period last year; and more than 20,000 mu of overwintering crops grew strong and lovely due to special cultivation and management. After the establishment of the responsibility system, political and ideological work must not be abandoned or relaxed. On the contrary, political and ideological work must be strengthened, and commune members must be constantly educated in socialism and communism, so that the personal interests of commune members can be subordinated to the interests of the collective and the state, and they are full of love and responsibility for the collective cause.

At present, various places are rectifying the communes, and how to improve the production responsibility system is a problem that urgently needs to be solved. Therefore, the leadership in various places should quickly establish and improve the production responsibility system in communes where labor management is unsound, and further exert the superiority of the people's communes to ensure the realization of even greater leap forward targets this year.

### 人民公社要建立和健全生产责任制

    人民公社要建立和健全生产责任制
    党中央提出的今年农业生产的跃进指标是一个伟大而艰巨的任务。要完成这个任务，除了继续反对右倾保守思想，破除迷信，解放思想，鼓足干劲，力争上游外，还要有相应的一系列的措施。建立和健全生产责任制就是其中最重要的措施之一。
    社会主义经济是有计划的经济。建立生产责任制，就是为了保证国家计划和公社计划的完成。生产责任制是工业管理的基本原则，也是农业管理的基本原则。有了这种制度，首先会消灭生产中的无人负责现象，保证各项指标的实现。又因为这种制度，明确规定了任何一个工作人员，在生产战线上的一定的工作范围、工作职责、工作任务及其性质，明确规定了每一件工作或每一项生产和每一个机器或每一块土地的负责单位和人员，这就可以鼓励每个单位每个人员更好地去完成和超额完成自己的任务。人民公社应该逐步地建立一套严格的责任制度。这样，不仅仅根据国家计划公社计划一般地提出农业发展多少，工业发展多少，林牧副渔各业发展多少，一般地号召和组织大家来完成这些任务，而且可以把各项指标和措施，具体分配到管理区、生产队以至社员，保证负责完成。当然，这并不是说，有了责任制，再也不会发生浪费材料和劳动力的现象，再也不会出现完不成计划的现象。但是，有了责任制，就可以减少这种现象，而且在发生这些现象的时候，也容易找出原因，加以改进，迎头赶上前去。
    大范围的协作，也叫做“大兵团作战”，在去年秋天曾被广泛地采用。这是一种行之有效的劳动组织形式和生产方法。许多公社因为采用了这种方法，秋收工作进行得很快，地翻得又快又深，麦子及时地播种下去，土高炉遍地开花。但是，绝不能因此就否认了生产责任制的必要性。去年的实践证明：“大兵团作战”只能是一种临时的突击的劳动组织形式和生产方法，因为多数农事活动只适于建立经常性的专业生产队和综合生产队。因此，公社应以经常性的专业生产队和综合生产队为主，结合必要的劳力和互相支援的协作。这里就需要有明确的责任制。而且，即使在大协作大兵团作战中，责任制同样是不可缺少的一种制度。建立了责任制，每个生产队、每个社员就有了明确的工作范围、工作职责，就可以避免或者减少“窝工”现象，提高劳动效率。
    生产责任制的建立，有利于社员掌握和迅速提高生产技术，成为专家。这因为一个人长时期管理一项生产，就会了解这项生产的各个方面，掌握这项生产的全部技术。当然，这并不妨碍在熟悉本岗位生产技术之外，同时学习和熟悉其他方面的生产技术，即成为“多面手”“万能人”，种水稻的能手同时懂得植棉技术，种庄稼的农民同时懂得制造工具的技术……。但是，要成为“多面手”“万能人”，必须一项一项来学习，首先熟悉本岗位的生产技术，搞好本岗位的生产，然后逐步熟悉其他方面的生产技术，否则，既不能成为专家，也不能成为“多面手”、“万能人”。
    建立什么样的生产责任制，现在有着许多不同的做法。从许多地方的情况来看，应该建立“任务到队，管理到组，措施到田，责任到人，检查验收”的集体责任制和个人责任制。公社对管理区（大队）和生产队，一般应该推行“四定、一奖制”，就是根据全社总的计划，把全年各种作物和各种生产的产量、措施、投资、用工、管理人员定下来，超额完成者给予奖励，因经营管理得不好而没有完成者给予批评教育，以至必要的处分。当然，由于情况不同，有些人民公社也可以实行“三定、一奖”，或者实行“六定、一奖”，或者实行“三包”（包产、包工、包投资）的制度。
    不但在农业生产方面需要推行责任制，就是公社的工业和林业、牧业、副业、渔业以及服务性事业中，也都需要有责任制度。从田间、车间到食堂、托儿所，都要按照预定的计划和定额，有秩序地进行工作。
    人民公社的生产责任制，必须建立在社员的高度的劳动自觉性的基础之上，没有社员的劳动自觉性，责任制是建立不起来的；即使勉强建立起来了，所发生的作用也不大。建立责任制的目的，是为了充分发挥而不是束缚社员的劳动积极性。正像一个公社社员说的：“只有了解了自己的责任，浑身的劲儿才能使得出来。”1月15日本报报道的江西南昌县“八一”公社在群众自觉的基础上建立责任制的事实，就证明了这一点。“八一”公社推行责任制以后，社员明确了自己的生产任务，劳动积极性大大提高。两个月内，完成了兴修水利工程任务的80％；积肥量也比去年同期多了三分之二；两万多亩越冬作物由于专人培育管理，长得茁壮可爱。建立责任制以后，绝不能放弃或放松政治思想工作。相反的，要加强政治思想工作，要经常不断地对社员进行社会主义、共产主义教育，要使社员个人利益能够服从集体和国家的利益，对集体事业充满热爱和责任感。
    目前各地正在整顿公社，怎样健全生产责任制度是一个急迫需要解决的问题。因此，各地领导上应当在劳动管理不健全的公社中，迅速建立和健全生产责任制，更大地发挥人民公社的优越性，保证今年更大的跃进指标的实现。
