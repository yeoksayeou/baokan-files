Spring Festival Short Piece

　　Stringing red lanterns, setting off firecrackers, every household’s lintel says "The Commune is Good"; girls are performing "Seizing the Red Flag", children are performing "Poking at Baby Birds"; old men sit and chat about the harvest, smiling so that their white hair shakes… Only our old commune leader, after repairing the plow, repairs the horse collar, others advise him to take a break, the words he speaks are highly reasonable: "The commune has two days off each month, we usually rest well on normal days. Old people should rest because they are old, children should rest because they are young, young men and women love liveliness, if we don't celebrate during the Spring Festival, when will we celebrate? My heart can't rest, we need to start the second plowing early!" Others advise him, but he doesn't listen, his wife comes and pulls him home. Piping hot, are dumplings, brand new, is a black padded jacket; wearing new clothes, he looks young, full of food, his face glows red. His wife keeps him from leaving, leading the grandchildren to go to the streets. This time, ah this time, alas, our commune leader can't escape!

    春节短曲
  　田奇扎红灯，放鞭炮，家家门楣“公社好”；姑娘演的“夺红旗”，娃娃演的“掏小鸟”；老汉对坐谈丰收，笑得满头白发摇……。独有咱们老社长，修罢犁耙修马套，别人劝他歇一歇，他说的话道理高：“公社每月两天假，平常日子早歇好。老人该歇年纪老，娃娃该歇年纪小，小伙姑娘爱红火，春节不闹啥时闹？我的心，歇不下，二次犁地要动手早！”别人劝他他不听，老伴来了一把拉上往家跑。热腾腾，是水饺，新崭崭，是黑袄；换上新衣年纪青，吃饱脸上红光罩。老伴守住他不走，引上孙孙要上街道。这一下呀这一下，嗳呀呀，我们的社长逃不了！
