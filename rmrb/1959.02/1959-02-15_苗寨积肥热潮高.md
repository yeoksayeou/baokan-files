A high tide of manure collection is sweeping through the Miao villages in the Kaihuai Management District of Kaili Commune, Leishan County. The smoke from burning grass and wood ash rises into the clouds; heaps of fertilizer in the fields and at the foot of the mountains resemble small hills.

On January 8th, when the Party branch of the Management District decided to launch a manure collection campaign, putting forward the slogan of "hard work, clever work, ensuring the fields are well-fed," it immediately received enthusiastic support from the commune members. Some commune members said, "People get hungry without food, and crops don't grow strong without fertilizer." The fifty-five young men responsible for managing the high-yield fields dug more than thirty manure pits around the high-yield fields in two days, and immediately filled them with fertilizer. Wen Hualiu, a Miao female commune member from the Second Production Team, went out to collect cow dung before dawn every day, collecting more than 700 catties a day.

During the manure collection campaign, the Miao commune members were very enthusiastic and came up with many ideas. They found a total of twelve sources of fertilizer. From January 11th to 15th, the entire Management District collected more than 2.18 million catties of various natural fertilizers, most of which were highly effective fertilizers such as human and animal manure.

    苗寨积肥热潮高
    本报讯　雷山县凯里公社开怀管理区的各个苗家村寨，正掀起了积肥热潮。烧草木灰的青烟冲入云霄；田坝里和山脚下的堆肥像一个个小山包。
    1月8日，当管理区党支部决定开展积肥运动，并提出苦干、巧干、保证田土吃饱饭的口号时，立即得到社员们的热烈拥护。有的社员说：“人不吃饭饿得慌，庄稼没有肥料长不壮。”负责管理丰产坝的五十五个青年小伙子，在丰产坝周围，两天就挖了三十多个粪坑，随即装满了肥料。第二生产队苗族女社员文花六，每天天不亮就出去拣牛粪，一天能拣七百多斤。
    积肥运动中，苗族社员们干劲很大，想的办法也很多，他们共找出了十二种肥源。从1月11日到15日的五天中，全管理区积了各种自然肥料二百十八万多斤，其中绝大部分都是人粪、畜粪等肥效很高的肥料。　　　（本报贵州记者站）
