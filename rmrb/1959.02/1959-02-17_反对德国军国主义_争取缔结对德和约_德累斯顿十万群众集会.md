Xinhua News Agency, February 16th, Berlin (TASS dispatch of February 14th): A mass rally attended by over 100,000 people was recently held in the city of Dresden, which was severely damaged in World War II, to commemorate the fourteenth anniversary of the destruction of Dresden. Attendees expressed their opposition to German militarism and their desire for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

Guests from West Germany and foreign countries attended the meeting, including delegations from the Polish cities of Warsaw and Wrocław, and a delegation from the British city of Coventry, headed by Mayor Wyneslow. In addition, the conference also received telegrams of support for the residents of Dresden from Leningrad and Lidice.

Zindelmann, an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, said at the meeting that the residents of Dresden, like the residents of other European cities that suffered severe disasters during the war, sincerely hope for lasting peace. He continued, "We extend our hands to the residents of Coventry and London, Oradour and Rotterdam, Stalingrad and Warsaw, let us fight together for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany to stop German militarism."

Zindelmann warmly welcomed the constructive proposals put forward by the Soviet government and the Soviet people regarding the issue of a peace treaty with Germany. He also expressed his gratitude to the forty-eight British Labour Party MPs for suggesting that Parliament endorse the idea of establishing a German confederation and recognize the German Democratic Republic.

After the meeting, the Dresden City Council held an extraordinary meeting. Dresden's Chief Mayor, Gutt, handed Wyneslow a letter signed by 350,000 Dresden residents to the residents of Coventry. The letter requested efforts to conclude a peace treaty with Germany.

    反对德国军国主义　争取缔结对德和约
    德累斯顿十万群众集会
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社柏林14日讯：在第二次世界大战中受到严重破坏的德累斯顿城最近举行了有十多万人参加的群众大会，纪念德累斯顿遭到破坏十四周年。到会者表示，反对德国军国主义，争取缔结对德和约。
    出席大会的有来自西德和外国的客人，包括来自波兰的华沙和弗罗茨瓦夫市代表团及以市长温斯娄为首的英国考文垂市代表团。此外，大会还收到了列宁格勒和利迪泽拍来的声援德累斯顿居民的电报。
    德国统一社会党候补中央委员津德尔曼在大会上讲话说，德累斯顿的居民同欧洲其他在战争中遭到严重灾难的城市的居民一样，衷心希望持久和平。他接着说，我们向考文垂和伦敦、奥拉多尔和鹿特丹、斯大林格勒和华沙的居民伸出手来，让我们一道为争取缔结对德和约以制止德国军国主义而斗争。
    津德尔曼热烈欢迎苏联政府和苏联人民提出的关于对德和约问题的建设性建议。他还表示感谢四十八个英国工党议员，感谢他们建议议会赞同建立德国邦联的主张和承认德意志民主共和国。
    会后，德累斯顿市议会举行了非常会议。德累斯顿首席市长古特把一封由三十五万德累斯顿居民签字的致考文垂居民的信交给出席会议的温斯娄。信中要求争取缔结对德和约。
