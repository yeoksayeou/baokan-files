    The Cradle of Electricity
    ——A Visit to the Harbin Power Industry Base
    By Our Staff Reporter Ye Jianyun
    Early in the morning, I stepped through the snow to visit the Harbin Power Industry Base.
    The sun came out, and the sunlight reflected off the white snow, making the earth shine. Passing through the city, we arrived in the eastern suburbs, where we were greeted by the straight Anle Street. On this street, from west to east, along a nine-li stretch, factory buildings lined up one after another, chimneys standing shoulder to shoulder. This is the Harbin Power Industry Base, composed of the Harbin Boiler Factory, the Harbin Steam Turbine Factory, and the Harbin Electrical Machinery Factory. The scale of all three factories is very large; not to mention anything else, the people alone number 110,000. In terms of equipment, there are world-class behemoths: a vertical lathe taller than a two-story building, a horizontal lathe that could accommodate three or four hundred people standing on top, and a four-roller plate bending machine that could roll steel plates as thick as a bound edition of "Das Kapital" into cylinders...
    It is truly a remarkable thing that our country has these three large factories manufacturing power generation equipment. In Beijing, many people say that in Heilongjiang, you can hear the footsteps of our country's industrial progress. When I saw it with my own eyes, I truly realized that this is where our country's level lies, this is our country's strength.
    I have heard many stories about electricity and power generation equipment. Let me just mention one recent event. It was in 1954. Before that, we did not have our own factories to manufacture large-scale power generation equipment. However, in that year, the state decided to produce complete sets of 6,000-kilowatt boilers, steam turbines, and generators. At that time, more than ten provinces and cities across the country were organized to collaborate, and with the support of five industrial ministries of the Central Government, 122 factories participated in the manufacturing, spending two years to produce the 6,000-kilowatt power generation equipment. This equipment is now installed in the Huainan Power Plant. The event was a success, and people were very excited. However, how strenuous it was to do such a thing! The 6,000-kilowatt power generation equipment alone had more than 100,000 parts. Some factories could only produce one or two types of parts. With more than 100 factories, how many people had to travel by train, car, and bicycle, by land and water, to bring them all together!
    Now, everything is so simple. On one street, within a nine-li range, the boilers produced by the boiler factory, combined with the steam turbines from the steam turbine factory, and then equipped with the generators manufactured by the electrical machinery factory, form a complete set of power generation equipment. These three factories can not only produce 6,000-kilowatt and 10,000-kilowatt sets, but also 50,000-kilowatt complete sets have already been produced. 60,000-kilowatt, 100,000-kilowatt, and even larger equipment have either been successfully designed or have already been put into production. In terms of hydro generators, 72,500-kilowatt units have been manufactured, and 210,000-kilowatt units are being designed. Many people are talking about our country's progress and achievements. Looking at Anle Street, it is like drawing a straight upward red line.
    Putting several factories producing complete sets of equipment together to form a base has many advantages. At eight o'clock in the morning, when the steam turbine factory achieves success in reforming a certain product, the boiler factory and the electrical machinery factory know about it half an hour later. Similarly, the steam turbine factory is also aware of what the other two factories are considering. Since the Great Leap Forward, there have been daily and constant measures in enterprises to improve designs and innovate processes. With the factories placed together, the dissemination of technical information can be interconnected and closely linked. The three factories have only one goal: electricity.
    Arriving at the hydro turbine workshop of the electrical machinery factory, in this workshop that stretches as far as the eye can see, trains and trucks come and go, looking like a few small donkeys compared to those tall machines. Standing here, I don't know what the people of Xin'anjiang are thinking, nor what the people of Chongqing are considering, and I am even less clear about the plans of the Liaoning Thermal Power Plant. However, the power workers of Anle Street in Harbin are constantly thinking about you.
    This is their greeting.
    At the end of last November, Harbin was already covered with a thick layer of snow. In the canteen of the electrical machinery factory, the food smelled fragrant, and people were chewing on steamed buns while calculating. They were not calculating how many meal tickets to buy, nor how much savings to withdraw from the bank to buy a leather hat. This was a big calculation: thirty days to rush-produce a 72,500-kilowatt hydro generator. This is a behemoth that requires more than twenty train cars to transport. This is a gift, prepared by the workers of the electrical machinery factory for the people of Xin'anjiang, no, for the people of Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou as a New Year's gift.
    In the past, the workers of the electrical machinery factory had made hydro generators, but they were small, with the largest being no more than 15,000 kilowatts. The current figure is 72,500 kilowatts. Going from 15,000 kilowatts to 72,500 kilowatts is like going from elementary school to university through middle school and high school; it is technology, it is level, and it is not a simple matter. Moreover, it had to be rushed out within thirty days!
    "The river is wide and the banks are broad, the wind is right and the sail is high." These are lines of poetry describing the Yangtze River. Last December, the mass movement in the electrical machinery factory was like the mighty Yangtze River, with thousands of boats hoisting their sails and sailing downstream. The mass movement enabled the factory director and chief engineer to overcome one difficulty after another. Finally, as people hoped, before the hands of the clock pointed to twelve on New Year's Eve, the 72,500-kilowatt hydro generator was born. Thirty days is 43,200 minutes, and a hydro generator has more than 80,000 parts. This means that, on average, nearly two parts came into being every minute. When I came here, I did not see this behemoth weighing more than 600 tons. It had already been loaded onto the train and sent to Xin'anjiang. What a generous New Year's gift! In the near future, when the Xin'anjiang power station is completed, at night, when Shanghai workers stroll along the Bund, Nanjing university students sing and dance in the park, and tourists at West Lake admire the Mid-Autumn Festival moon reflected in the Three Pools, when those bright lights shine on everyone's face, don't forget that the happiness and brightness before people's eyes includes a contribution from the workers of the Harbin Electrical Machinery Factory.
    In the steam drum workshop of the boiler factory, when the 480-ton plate bending machine rolled a large, thick steel plate into a cylinder, I seemed to hear the boatmen's chant on the Jialing River.
    For the sake of the mountain city on the distant banks of the Jialing River, the lights in the office of the director of the Harbin Boiler Factory were on for several nights in a row. With the lights on, people were not playing poker, nor were they chatting, but were looking for a way to get the equipment to the Chongqing power station a few months earlier.
    Harbin is thousands of kilometers away from Chongqing. Perhaps the kindergarten children in Chongqing have not yet been taught by their nannies to say the three words "Harbin," but here on Anle Street, thousands of workers have come up with a series of good ideas for the people of Chongqing. The original boiler for the Chongqing power station was 50,000 kilowatts. To manufacture this boiler, it used to take 1,500 tons of steel. Now, the staff of the boiler factory launched a technical revolution, increasing the output to 60,000 kilowatts, while saving two-thirds of the steel. What does an increase of 10,000 kilowatts of output mean? It means that 2 million tons of steam can be generated within a year, turning it into electricity, which can replace the labor of 70,000 porters. However, this good idea was not thought up overnight. In order to increase the output, they analyzed the water of the Jialing River, studied the changes in temperature in Chongqing in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and also tested the coal from Sichuan... This is how the staff of the power base care about the people of Chongqing.
    In the evening, when the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel changed into clean clothes and went home, when the miners of the Fushun Laohutai Coal Mine sat in the health room, enjoying the sunbath, a 50,000-kilowatt steam turbine of the Harbin Steam Turbine Factory successfully completed its test run. This is the equipment they produced for the Liaoning Thermal Power Plant, and it is also the first heavy-duty steam turbine produced in our country since the dawn of time. This is a giant, a Hercules from mythology. After it is matched with a generator and boiler, it can generate 1.3 million kilowatt-hours of electricity every day, which can illuminate a large city of five million people. The steam turbine factory was only officially put into production on December 9th last year. As soon as this factory appeared, it produced such a giant. Facing the steam turbine being tested on the test bench, it was as if seeing a red sun, just rising from the east…
    Here, many celebration rallies have been held to celebrate every new achievement and victory. Amidst the enthusiastic applause, people always give the first bouquet of flowers to Soviet friends. This is flowers, this is gratitude. People will never forget that it is our friends and brothers – the Soviet people – who have given us sincere help.

    电的摇篮
    ——访哈尔滨动力工业基地
    本报记者　叶剑韵
    早晨，踏着积雪，去访问哈尔滨动力工业基地。
    太阳出来了，阳光映着白雪，大地一片光彩。穿过市区，来到东郊，迎面就是笔直的安乐大街。在这条大街上，从西往东，在九华里长的线路上，厂房接着厂房，烟囱挨着烟囱。这就是由哈尔滨锅炉厂、哈尔滨汽轮机厂、哈尔滨电机厂组成的哈尔滨动力工业基地。三个工厂的规模都很大，不说别的，光人，就住了十一万。在设备方面，有世界第一流的大家伙：什么比两层楼还要高大的立车，上面可以站下三四百号人的卧式车床，还有可以把洋装资本论那样厚的钢板卷成圆筒的四滚筒卷板机……
    我们国家，有了这样大的三个制造发电设备的工厂，真是一件了不起的事情。在北京，许多人都说，在黑龙江，可以听到我国工业前进的脚步声。当自己亲眼看到的时候，才真正体验到，在这里，有我们国家的水平，这里是我们国家的力量。
    关于电和发电设备，我听过不少故事。只说不久以前的一件吧。那是1954年，在此以前，我们自己还没有制造大型发电设备的工厂。然而就在这一年，国家决定要成套生产六千瓩的锅炉、汽轮机和发电机。当时，组织了全国十多个省市协作，在中央五个工业部的支持下，一百二十二个厂子参加制造，花了两年的时间，把六千瓩的发电设备制造出来了。这些设备，现在安装在淮南电站。事情是胜利了，人们很兴奋。然而，干这样一件事，是多么吃劲啊！六千瓩的发电设备，光零件就是十多万件。有的一个工厂只能生产一两个品种，一百多个工厂，把零件集中起来，要多少人坐火车、汽车、自行车，水上陆上的，才能把它搞到一起啊！
    现在，一切是这么简便。在一条街上，不出九华里的范围，锅炉厂出产的锅炉，配上汽轮机厂的汽轮机，再装上电机厂制造的发电机，就构成了一套发电设备。这三家工厂，不仅可以生产六千的、一万的，五万瓩的成套设备已经出厂了。六万的、十万的，甚至更大的设备，有的已经设计成功，有的已投料生产。在水轮发电机方面，七万二千五百瓩的已经制成，二十一万瓩的正在设计。许多人都在说我们国家的进步和成就，到安乐大街一看，这里是画了一条直线上升的红线。
    把生产成套设备的几个工厂摆在一起，形成基地，好处很多。早晨八点钟，汽轮机厂在改革某项产品方面得到成就，半个钟头以后，锅炉厂、电机厂就知道了。同样，其他两个厂在考虑些什么问题，汽轮机厂也是心中有数的。大跃进以来，企业里改进设计，革新工艺的措施，天天有，时时有，工厂摆在一起，技术情报的传播，就可以做到息息相通，脉脉相承。三个工厂，目的只有一个，这就是：电。
    来到电机厂的水轮机车间，在这一眼望不到边的厂房里，火车、汽车来来去去，和那些高大的机器一比，就像几头小毛驴。站在这里，我不知道新安江人在想些什么，也不知道重庆人在考虑什么，辽宁热电站的打算更不清楚。可是，哈尔滨安乐大街的动力工人，却时刻在叨念着你们。
    这是他们的问候。
    去年11月底，哈尔滨已经盖上厚厚的一层雪了。电机厂的食堂里，饭菜喷着香味，人们嚼着馒头，一边却在掐指头算账。算的不是要买多少饭票，也不是换一顶皮帽子需要到银行里去取多少存款。这是一笔大账，三十天，要赶制一台七万二千五百瓩的水轮发电机。这是要用二十多个车皮才能拉走的大家伙。这是一份礼品，是电机厂工人，为新安江人，不，是为上海人、南京人、杭州人准备的一份年礼。
    过去，电机厂的工人做过水轮发电机，那是小型的，最大的也不过一万五千瓩。现在的数字是七万二千五百瓩。从一万五千瓩到七万二千五百瓩，正像从小学到大学要经过初中、高中一样，是技术，是水平，是一件不简单的事情。何况要在三十天之内把它赶出来哩！
    潮平两岸阔，风正一帆悬。这是描写长江的诗句。去年12月，电机厂的群众运动，就像浩浩荡荡的长江一样，万船挂帆，顺流而下，群众运动，使厂长、总工程师渡过了一个又一个的难关。最后，像人们所希望的那样，除夕晚上的时针还没有指到十二点，七万二千五百瓩的水轮发电机就诞生了。三十天，是四万三千二百分钟，一台水轮发电机是八万多件零件，这就是说，平均每一分钟，就有将近两个零件来到人间。我来到这里，并没有看到这个六百多吨重的庞然大物，它已经上了火车，到新安江去了。这是一份多么丰厚的年礼！不久的将来，新安江电站建成了，晚上，当上海的工人游息在黄浦江边，南京的大学生在公园里载歌载舞，西湖的游人在三潭印月欣赏音乐会的时候，那一盏盏明亮的灯光，照在每个人的脸上，可不要忘记，人们眼前的幸福和光明，有哈尔滨电机厂工人的一份。
    在锅炉厂的汽包车间里，当四百八十吨重的卷板机把一大张厚厚的钢板，卷成圆筒的时候，耳朵里就像响起了嘉陵江的号子。
    为了遥远的嘉陵江畔的山城，哈尔滨锅炉厂厂长办公室的电灯几个通宵没有灭过。灯亮着，人们不是在打扑克，也不是在聊天，而是在寻找一条使重庆电站早几个月得到设备的道路。
    哈尔滨到重庆有几千公里的路程，也许重庆幼儿园的孩子，阿姨们还没有教会他们说哈尔滨三个字，可是，在这里的安乐大街上，成千上万的工人，却给重庆人想了一系列的好主意。重庆电站的锅炉，原来是五万瓩的，制造这台锅炉，在过去要用一千五百吨钢材，现在，锅炉厂的职工大闹了一阵技术革命，出力变成了六万瓩，而钢材却节省了三分之二。增加一万瓩的出力，这意味着什么呢？这意味着：一年之内可以发出二百万吨的蒸汽，把它变成电力，可以代替七万个搬运工人的劳动。可是，这个好主意不是一下子就想出来的。为了提高出力，他们分析了嘉陵江的水，研究了重庆春夏秋冬四季气温的变化，还化验了四川的煤炭……动力基地的职工，就是这样在关心重庆人的。
    傍晚，当鞍钢的工人换上一身干净衣服走回家去的时候，当抚顺老虎台的矿工坐在保健室里，享受着日光浴的时候，哈尔滨汽轮机厂一台五万瓩的汽轮机试车成功了。这是他们为辽宁热电站生产的设备，也是我国开天辟地以来出产的第一台重型汽轮机。这是个巨人，是神话里面的大力士，它和发电机、锅炉配套以后，每天能发一百三十万度，可以把五百万人口的大城市照得灯火通明。汽轮机厂是去年12月9日才正式投入生产的，这个工厂一出马，就搬出了这样一个巨人。面对着试验台上正在试车的汽轮机，好像看到了一轮红日，它刚刚从东方升起……
    在这里，开过了许许多多次的庆祝大会，庆贺着每一个新的成就和胜利。在热烈的掌声中，人们总是把第一捧鲜花送给苏联朋友。这是鲜花，这是感激。人们永远不会忘记，是我们的朋友和兄弟——苏联人民，他们给了我们诚挚的帮助。
