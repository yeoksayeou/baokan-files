Shandong Accumulates Manure with Great Momentum and High Enthusiasm
Building Indigenous Fertilizer Plants to Prepare "Fine Grain" for Wheat

(Our dispatch) A mass manure accumulation campaign, where everyone participates and every household accumulates and creates fertilizer, has begun to unfold enthusiastically in Shandong Province. From the mountainous areas of Yimeng to the Jiaodong Peninsula, from the vast plains of southwestern Shandong to the coastal areas of northern Shandong, people are trying every means to tap fertilizer sources and accumulate manure in large quantities. The manure accumulation campaign in Shandong Province was launched after various localities summarized their experiences from the previous stage of the campaign and reorganized their manure accumulation plans and labor forces. Therefore, the momentum of the manure accumulation campaign has grown stronger and stronger. On January 29th, the province's manure accumulation team expanded to more than 2.74 million people, an increase of more than 1 million compared to a few days ago, and this mighty force is still rapidly growing.

With the vigorous unfolding of the manure accumulation campaign, the achievements in manure accumulation in various localities are also increasing day by day, and many moving deeds have emerged. The young men of the Hongrui People's Commune in Linyi City, in a cold weather, smashed through the ice to dig up pond mud, and in a short time, they dug up more than 200 cartloads. Eighty male and female teachers of the Baichihe Commune in Zhucheng County used their spare time to collect more than 59,000 jin of manure in three days. Zhang Ziyuan, an old man from the commune's home for the elderly, also went out early and returned late every day, with his manure basket never leaving his shoulder. This increasingly large-scale manure accumulation campaign has led to a rapid increase in the amount of manure accumulated throughout the province. As of January 29th, the province had accumulated 243 billion jin of native and miscellaneous fertilizers, an increase of more than 62 billion jin compared to a week ago.

In the manure accumulation and fertilizer production campaign in Shandong Province, various localities have mobilized everyone's enthusiasm by focusing on ideological work, especially by calculating tasks, time, and labor, thereby promoting the further development of the manure accumulation campaign. Through this work, various communes in Zhucheng County put forward a total of 65,000 rationalization proposals. As a result, the county has accumulated 16.6 billion jin of native and miscellaneous fertilizers since January, an increase of more than double the total amount of fertilizer accumulated in November and December last year. Linyi City also further launched the manure accumulation campaign by specifically and carefully calculating the three aspects of time, tasks, and labor, and has now accumulated 7.5 billion jin of miscellaneous fertilizers. Liaocheng Prefecture has always relied on putting politics in command, and its progress in manure accumulation is far ahead in the province.

While carrying out tremendous ideological work and organizational work, various localities have also generally established a "three-guarantee" (tasks, time, labor) and "five-fixed" (tasks, time, labor, quality, rewards and punishments) manure accumulation responsibility system, thus making the enthusiasm for manure accumulation even stronger, the progress faster, and the quality higher. After implementing the method of combining compulsory manure accumulation by commune members with rewards, Linyi Prefecture added more than 29 billion jin of fertilizer in ten days. Jining, Laiyang and other prefectures have also increased the accumulation of a lot of fertilizer as a result.

During this period, cadres at all levels also demonstrated a spirit of vigorous work, taking the lead in carrying out manure accumulation with their own exemplary actions. Secretaries and members of the CCP Changyi County Committee, such as Wen Chaoshu, took the lead in leading more than 700 cadres directly under the county to carry manure baskets, collecting 3 million jin of manure in three days. In Rizhao County, there are now more than 32,000 commune and team cadres carrying manure baskets. A new situation has emerged in the county: cadres carrying manure baskets, commune members busy accumulating fertilizer, not going uphill empty-handed, and not returning home with empty baskets.

At present, leaders in various parts of Shandong are devoting great energy to deploy troops and generals, striving to organize a larger-scale upsurge of manure accumulation and fertilizer production in a short period of time. (Cao Xuepu)

Also reported: Shandong Province is adopting the method of building factories, preparing materials, producing fertilizer, and applying fertilizer simultaneously, and following the principle of building factories locally, taking materials locally, processing locally, and self-producing and self-using, vigorously grasping the production of indigenous chemical fertilizers, and preparing sufficient "fine grain" for wheat.

Counties and communes such as Shouzhang and Pingyuan have expanded their fertilizer plants, with everyone working on raw materials and professional teams carrying out shock production, turning hundreds of thousands of mu of alkaline land into a treasure bowl for producing chemical fertilizers, and making full use of dozens of raw materials such as grass ash, bones, alkali, salt, and brine. The number of people making fertilizer in Shouzhang has increased to 150,000, and 330 million jin of fertilizer has been produced.

The CCP Shandong Provincial Committee recently deeply analyzed the characteristics of this year's wheat close planting and the urgent need for a large amount of fine fertilizer to be applied after frost damage at a manure accumulation radio conference. The Committee requested that each mu of land be applied with 1,000 to 3,000 jin of indigenous chemical fertilizer. The CCP Gaotang and Shanghe County Committees have held emergency meetings to arrange fertilizer production, and the county committees have taken the lead in going deep into communes and teams to provide specific assistance. Now, Gaotang County produces 115,000 jin of indigenous chemical fertilizer daily, and smoke is billowing everywhere. The enthusiasm in Chiping County is even greater, and it is planned to produce another 2,000 to 3,000 jin of indigenous chemical fertilizer for each mu of wheat field within the 20 days from January 20th to the Spring Festival. Under the slogan of "getting fertilizer from the sea and treasures from the sea," the Jiaodong Peninsula launched a mass campaign of "one commune, hundreds of factories, thousands of stoves" to vigorously produce chemical fertilizers. Statistics as of January 23 showed that more than 13,000 fertilizer plants had been restored, producing 750 million jin of various indigenous chemical fertilizers using seawater.

The vast number of fishermen along the coast also participated in the fertilizer production campaign. Fishermen carried the seafood they caught ashore and turned it into a large amount of fish fertilizer. In the vigorous indigenous chemical fertilizer campaign in Shandong, special attention was paid to improving the quality of fertilizer. Many district secretaries took action to sum up past fertilizer production experiences, and used on-site visits and practical operations to train a large number of technicians, so that advanced experiences could blossom everywhere. The more than 100 kinds of indigenous chemical fertilizers and granular fertilizers produced in Guangrao, Linyi and other counties are generally one jin equivalent to thirty to fifty jin compared with farm manure. These fertilizers contain nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, and are suitable for both topdressing and base fertilizer. Shandong Province has also resolutely implemented the principle of focusing on indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods in fertilizer manufacturing. While vigorously developing indigenous chemical fertilizers, it has also actively developed the manufacture of high-grade chemical fertilizers. Jinan Yuxing and Zhangqiu Chemical Fertilizer Plants produced 20,000 tons in the first quarter of this year. Many indigenous chemical fertilizer plants have also sent technicians to advanced chemical fertilizer plants to learn fertilizer production techniques that transform indigenous methods into foreign methods.

    山东积肥声势大干劲足
    大办土化肥厂为小麦准备“细粮”
    本报讯　一个人人动手、户户积肥造肥的全民性积肥运动，已经开始在山东省热火朝天的开展起来。从沂蒙山区到胶东半岛，从鲁西南大平原到鲁北海滨的广大农村，正在千方百计的挖掘肥源，大积肥料。山东省的积肥运动，是在各地总结了前段运动的经验和重新安排了积肥计划和劳动力以后开展起来的，因此积肥运动的声势就越来越大。上月29日全省积肥队伍扩大到二百七十四万多人，较前几天增加了一百多万，而且这支劲旅还在迅速壮大。
    随着积肥运动的猛烈展开，各地的积肥成绩也与日俱增，并且出现了许多感人事迹。临沂市洪瑞人民公社的小伙子，在一个寒冷的天气里，砸开冰冻挖汪泥，短时间就挖出了二百多车。诸城县百尺河公社八十名男女教师利用业余时间，在三天中拾了五万九千多斤大粪。这个公社敬老院的张子元老汉，每天也早出晚归，粪筐不离肩。这种规模日益壮大的积肥运动，使全省积肥数量迅速上升。到上月29日，全省已积土杂肥二万四千三百亿斤，较一周前增加六百二十亿多斤。
    山东省在积肥造肥运动中，各地都通过大抓思想，特别是通过算任务、算时间、算劳力，动员起大家积极性，从而推动了积肥运动的进一步开展。诸城县各个公社通过这一工作共提出了六万五千条合理化建议，因而全县自1月份以来就积土杂肥一百六十六亿斤，比去年11、12两个月积肥总数增加一倍多。临沂市在具体细算时间、任务、劳力三笔，也进一步掀起了积肥运动，现已积杂肥七十五亿斤。聊城专区由于一直依靠政治挂帅，积肥进度在全省遥遥领先。
    各地在进行巨大的思想工作、组织工作的同时，还较普遍的建立了“三包”（任务、时间、劳力）、“五定”（任务、时间、劳力、质量、奖惩）积肥责任制，因而积肥劲头更足，进度加快，质量更高。临沂专区在实行社员义务积肥加奖励的办法后，十天中就增添肥料二百九十多亿斤。济宁、莱阳等专区也因此增积了许多肥料。
    这一期间，各级干部也发挥了猛干的精神，纷纷以自己的模范行动带领社员大搞积肥。中共昌邑县温朝书等书记和委员，首先率领县直属机关七百多名干部背起了粪筐，三天中拾粪三百万斤。日照县现在背起粪筐的社、队干部达三万二千多人。全县出现了干部背粪筐，社员积肥忙，上坡不空手，回家不空篓的新局面。
    目前，山东各地领导正以极大精力，调兵遣将，争取在短时期内组织更大规模的积肥造肥高潮。　　（曹学璞）
    又讯　山东各地采取边建厂、边备料、边生产、边施肥的方法和依据就地建厂、就地取材、就地加工、自产自用的方针，大抓土化肥生产，为小麦准备充足的“细粮”。
    寿张、平原等县社社队队扩建了化肥厂，人人动手搞原料，专业队伍突击造，把几十万亩硷地变成了生产化肥的聚宝盆，把草木灰、骨、碱、盐、卤等几十种原料全部利用起来。寿张造化肥人数已增加到十五万，已造肥三亿三千万斤。
    中共山东省委最近在积肥广播大会上，又深刻地分析了今年小麦密植，伾冻以后极需追施大量细肥的特点，要求各地做到每亩地施土化肥一至三千斤。中共高唐、商河等县县委已召开紧急会议布置造肥，县委分头挂帅深入社、队具体帮助。现在高唐县日产土化肥十一万五千斤，遍地烟雾弥漫。茌平县的干劲更大，计划从1月20日起至春节的二十天内，再给每亩麦田生产出二至三千斤土化肥。胶东半岛在“向大海要肥、向大海要宝”的口号下，沿海各地开展了一个“一社百厂千灶”的大搞化肥的群众运动，到1月23日统计，恢复了化肥厂一万三千多处，用海水造各种土化肥七亿五千万斤。
    沿海的广大渔民也参加了制化肥的运动，渔民们出海打鱼把捞上来的海腥等都载到岸上，制成大量的腥肥。山东各地在大搞土化肥运动中，特别注意了提高肥料的质量。许多地区书记动手总结以往造肥经验，利用现场参观实际操作的方法训练了大批技术人员，使先进经验遍地开花。广饶、临沂等县造出来的一百余种土化肥、颗粒肥，与农家肥比较，一般是一斤能顶三十至五十斤。这些肥料都含有氮、磷、钾，既适合追肥又能作基肥。山东省在化肥制造上，还坚决执行了以土为主，土洋结合的方针。在大搞土化肥的同时，也积极发展了高级化肥的制造。济南裕兴和张秋化肥厂，今年第一季度就生产了二万吨。许多土化肥厂还派技术人员到高级化肥厂学习由土变洋的造肥技术。　　（赵浦）
