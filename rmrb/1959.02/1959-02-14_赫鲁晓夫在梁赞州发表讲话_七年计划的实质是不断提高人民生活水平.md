Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th -- TASS reported from Moscow on the 13th: Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, spoke at a mass meeting of workers at the Ryazan Machine Tool Factory on the 12th.

Khrushchev said that those who used to ridicule Soviet plans are now too preoccupied to ridicule; they are now filled with fear for the future of the capitalist world. They see what people who have freed themselves from the oppression of capitalists and landlords can accomplish once they hold power.

Khrushchev said that unprecedented possibilities have unfolded before the Soviet people, and they are advancing at a pace that capitalist societies cannot dream of.

He went on to say that the era when our people could be plundered is gone forever. Therefore, the imperialists say that it is difficult to negotiate with the Soviet leaders, that the Soviet leaders are uncompromising. Khrushchev emphasized that it is indeed difficult, even impossible, to negotiate with those who want to gain advantages from us. But those who come to our country with sincere wishes find it easy to negotiate with us. Khrushchev said we respond to friendship with friendship.

He also said that no one doubts that the Seven-Year Plan will be completed. This plan was drafted taking into account that there should be the potential to provide great possibilities for further improvements in living standards.

Khrushchev pointed out that if industrial enterprises overfulfilled the plan by about 2%, the country could gain more than 900 billion rubles worth of products in seven years. Khrushchev said that the additional accumulation will first be used to build housing in order to shorten the time frame for completing the housing construction plan.

Khrushchev went to Ryazan to award the Oblast the Order of Lenin. This Oblast received the medal for its outstanding achievements in agricultural production.

In his speech, Khrushchev highly praised the initiatives of collective farms and state farms in Ryazan Oblast, which decided to increase meat production by 2.8 times in 1959.

Khrushchev pointed out that many republics and oblasts in our country have made guarantees to increase production. He said that the task of fully satisfying our country's need for meat will soon be resolved.

In closing his speech, Khrushchev emphasized that the entire essence of the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for developing the national economy is to continuously improve the living standards of the Soviet people.

    赫鲁晓夫在梁赞州发表讲话
    七年计划的实质是不断提高人民生活水平
    苏联人民正以资本主义社会梦想不到的速度向前迈进
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科13日讯：苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫12日在梁赞机床制造厂的工人群众大会上讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫说，那些过去讥笑苏联计划的人现在顾不到讥笑了，他们现在对资本主义世界的前途满怀着恐惧，他们看到，摆脱了资本家和地主压迫的人民一旦掌握政权以后，能够干出什么样的事业来。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联人民面前展开了空前的可能性，他们正以资本主义社会梦想不到的步伐向前迈进。
    他接着说，可以掠夺我们人民的时代已经一去不复返了。因此，帝国主义者说同苏联领导人很难谈妥，说苏联领导人是不让步的。赫鲁晓夫着重说，那些想从我们这里捞一把的人的确是很难、甚至不可能谈妥的。而那些抱着真诚的心愿到我国来的人却容易同我们谈妥。赫鲁晓夫说，我们用友谊来回答友谊。
    他又说，对于七年计划将要完成这一点任何人都不表示怀疑。编制这项计划时考虑到：应当拥有能为生活水平的进一步提高提供巨大可能的潜力。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，如果工业企业超额完成计划约2％，那么国家在七年中就可以多获得九千余亿卢布的产品。赫鲁晓夫说，额外的积累将首先用来建筑住宅，以便缩短住宅建筑计划完成的期限。
    赫鲁晓夫是为了授给梁赞州列宁勋章而到梁赞去的。这个州由于农业生产上的卓越成绩而获得了勋章。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中对梁赞州的集体农庄和国营农场的创议给予很高的评价，它们决定在1959年使肉类产量增加二点八倍。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，我国许多共和国和州都作出了增加产品的保证，他说，充分满足我国对肉类的需要的任务不久即将解决。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话结束时强调说，苏联发展国民经济七年计划就其整个实质来说是为了不断地提高苏联人民的生活水平。（附图片）
