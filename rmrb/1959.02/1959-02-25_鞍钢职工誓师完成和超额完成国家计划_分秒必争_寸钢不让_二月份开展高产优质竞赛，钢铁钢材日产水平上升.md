Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, February 24th: The steel city of Anshan has sounded the call for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. On the 22nd, over 60,000 people held a solemn oath-taking rally, determined to muster even greater revolutionary zeal to guarantee the fulfillment or overfulfillment of this year's larger steel production tasks.

The rally was held in Victory Square in the center of Anshan. Just over a month ago, as 1959 had just begun, more than 100,000 people from the steel city gathered here to celebrate the glorious achievements of 1958; now, with even greater confidence in victory, they have made bold vows here to achieve this year's great leap forward targets.

Yang Shijie, First Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke first at the meeting. After briefly describing the great leap forward situation in the city in 1958, Yang Shijie pointed out: Adapting to the new situation of a greater leap forward nationwide, Anshan's steel production this year must also make a greater leap forward. This year, the city's output of steel, iron, and steel products accounts for a large proportion of the country's total. Whether this task can be better completed is directly related to the completion of the national steel production plan this year, and at the same time, it has a decisive impact on Anshan's even greater leap forward next year and the year after. He called on all workers in the city to mobilize urgently and quickly launch a large-scale high tide of a comprehensive leap forward with steel as the key, and to strive to complete this year's glorious and arduous tasks.

Yuan Zhen, First Secretary of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Shi Lei, Vice Chairman of the Anshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Zhang Shu, Deputy Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Guan Jiming, Director of the Anshan Municipal Women's Federation, also spoke at the meeting. At the meeting, Levin, the Soviet expert representative stationed in Anshan, representing all the Soviet experts who had made outstanding contributions to the great leap forward in Anshan Steel, enthusiastically congratulated the people of the steel city on the glorious achievements made in 1958, and wished them even greater achievements in 1959.

More than 60,000 workers, peasants, and representatives from all walks of life from all over the city were full of confidence in guaranteeing the completion of Anshan Steel's steel production tasks this year. They were all in high spirits and full of vigor. Worker representatives ran to the rostrum one after another to express their determination to the Party. The first to run to the rostrum was Meng Tai, a national model worker and Deputy Director of the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant. He represented the workers of the entire plant in expressing their determination: To realize socialist industrialization, steel is an indispensable thing. This year, our plant must greatly improve in terms of both output and quality compared to last year. We are determined to take effective measures such as increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio to ensure the overfulfillment of this year's pig iron production tasks. As soon as Meng Tai's voice fell, Li Tingshun, a well-known national advanced producer and shift director of Ding Shift in the Anshan No. 2 Steel Plant, ran to the microphone again. He represented all the steelworkers of Anshan Steel in saying: Our steel plant will not only guarantee to produce more steel this year, but also must guarantee more varieties and high quality. We deeply understand the great significance of completing and overfulfilling this year's plan. We are determined to work hard, diligently, and skillfully, starting from expanding the charge per furnace and launching a mass movement to protect furnaces and rapidly produce steel, to ensure the early completion of this glorious and arduous task. Immediately afterwards, representatives from the Anshan Chemical Comprehensive Construction Site, which is rushing to repair the No. 4 coking oven, representatives from the local state-owned Anshan Rolling Mill Machinery Factory, and peasant representatives from Liaoyang City and Haicheng County also put forward leap forward plans and guarantee measures to the meeting, guaranteeing to support Anshan Steel's great leap forward from all aspects.

Inspired by the new and greater leap forward situation this year, Anshan's steel army had already beaten the drums on all fronts before this conference, and launched day and night struggles to achieve more arduous steel production plans. More than 1,000 steel experts fighting next to the five large fixed open-hearth furnaces that had just been built seized every minute and yielded not an ounce of steel as they entered the new year, and in the first 19 days of February alone, they overfulfilled the plan and produced more than 1,300 tons of high-quality steel for the country. The rolling steel workers of the Anshan No. 1 and No. 2 Medium Plate Plants continued to advance on the basis of overfulfilling the January plan. In the first 19 days of February, the two plants increased the production of high-quality medium plates for the country by more than 6,700 tons. As the workers of each unit launched a high-yield, high-quality competition, the average daily output of the entire Anshan Steel from February 1st to 20th increased by 3.3% for iron, 9% for steel, and 5.7% for steel products compared with January.

    鞍钢职工誓师完成和超额完成国家计划
    分秒必争　寸钢不让
    二月份开展高产优质竞赛，钢铁钢材日产水平上升
    新华社鞍山24日电　钢都鞍山吹响了今年更大更好更全面跃进的号角，22日全市六万多人举行了庄严的誓师大会，决心鼓起更大的革命干劲，保证完成或超额完成今年更大的钢铁生产任务。
    大会在鞍山市中心的胜利广场举行。一个多月以前，当1959年刚刚到来的时候，钢都十万多人曾经在这里集会，庆祝了1958年取得的辉煌成就；现在，他们又怀着更大的胜利信心，为实现今年的大跃进指标在这里立下了豪迈的誓言。
    中共鞍山市委第一书记杨士杰首先在会上讲了话。杨士杰在概要地叙述了1958年全市大跃进的情况以后指出：适应着全国更大跃进的新形势，鞍山市今年的钢铁生产也要来个更大的跃进。今年，全市钢、铁和钢材的产量，在全国占着很大的比重。这个任务能否更好地完成，直接关系着今年全国钢铁生产计划的完成，同时对于鞍山市明年后年的更大跃进，也有着决定性的影响。他号召全市职工紧急动员起来，迅速掀起一个声势浩大的以钢为纲全面跃进的高潮，为完成今年的光荣艰巨的任务而奋斗。
    中共鞍山钢铁公司委员会第一书记、鞍山钢铁公司经理袁振，鞍山市总工会副主席石磊，共青团鞍山市委副书记张述，鞍山市妇女联合会主任管冀明等，都在会上讲了话。会上，苏联专家驻鞍山代表列文代表全体曾在鞍钢大跃进中作出卓越贡献的苏联专家，热情洋溢地祝贺钢都人民1958年取得的辉煌成就，并且预祝1959年获得更大成就。
    来自全市各个方面的六万多名职工、农民以及各行各业的代表，对于保证完成鞍钢今年的钢产任务，充满了信心，他们个个精神抖擞，人人意气风发。职工代表一个接着一个跑上主席台向党表示决心。第一个跑上主席台的是全国劳动模范、鞍钢炼铁厂副厂长孟泰。他代表全厂工人表示决心说：实现社会主义工业化，钢铁是不可缺的东西。今年，我们这个厂无论产量或质量上，都要比去年大大提高。我们决心采取提高冶炼强度、降低焦比等有效措施，保证超额完成今年生铁生产任务。孟泰的话音刚刚落地，著名的全国先进生产者、鞍钢第二炼钢厂丁班值班主任李廷顺又跑到扩音机前。他代表鞍钢全体炼钢工人说：我们炼钢厂今年不仅保证增产更多的钢，而且必须保证多品种、高质量。我们深深懂得完成和超额完成今年计划的重大意义。我们坚决实干、苦干、巧干，从扩大本炉装入量、开展群众性的护炉和快速炼钢运动入手，保证这一光荣而又艰巨的任务提前完成。紧接着，正在赶修四号炼焦炉的鞍山化工综合工地的代表、地方国营鞍山轧钢机械厂的代表，以及辽阳市、海城县的农民代表，也都向大会提出了跃进计划和保证措施，保证从各个方面支援鞍钢的大跃进。
    为今年新的更大跃进形势所激励的鞍山市钢铁大军，早在这次大会以前就已经在各个战线上擂起了战鼓，为实现更加艰巨的钢铁生产计划展开了昼夜奋战。战斗在刚刚建成不久的五座大型固定式平炉旁边的一千多名钢铁能手们，跨进新的一年就分秒必争、寸钢不让，仅在2月份前十九天里就超计划为国家生产了一千三百多吨优质钢。鞍钢第一、第二中板厂的轧钢职工，在超额完成1月份计划的基础上继续前进，2月份的前十九天中，两个厂共为国家增产优质中板六千七百多吨。由于各单位职工开展了高产、优质竞赛，全鞍钢在2月1日至20日的平均日产量和1月份比较，铁提高3.3％，钢提高9％，钢材提高5.7％。（附图片）
