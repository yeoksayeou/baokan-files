As night falls, a bonfire is lit in the drum tower of the Dong ethnic villages. The choir, composed of young men and women, practices or competes in singing here, and love songs expressing the young people's feelings are also conveyed here. Even five- or six-year-old children receive a musical baptism here. The gray-haired song master is the most respected person in the drum tower, and he teaches the traditional songs of the Dong people to the younger generation.

Dong songs are beautiful, melodious, and have a unique style. It is a rare form of music among the various ethnic groups in China that features harmony, counterpoint, accompaniment, and a complete form. The songs are divided into types such as grand songs performed by the choir, small songs sung solo or in duet, and pipa songs that are sung while playing the pipa. The content includes narrative grand songs based on folk tales and lyrical songs that sing about love. The grand songs sung by the Dong choir are mostly calculated in sets. Some sets include several songs, while others include dozens. It is estimated that the reserves of Dong grand choral songs are over 10,000 sets. The picture shows Dong girls from Wanzhai Village, Rongjiang County, singing Pipa songs.

    姑娘演唱琵琶歌
    每当夜幕降临时，侗族村寨的鼓楼里烧起篝火，由青年男女组成的合唱团就在这里练歌或比歌，年轻人抒发衷肠的情歌也在这里传递。五六岁的小孩子也在这里接受音乐的洗礼。白发苍苍的歌师傅，是鼓楼里最受尊敬的人，他把侗族的传统歌曲教给年青一代。
    侗歌优美动听，有独特风格。它是我国各民族音乐中少有的有和声、有对位、有伴奏、又有完整形式的音乐。歌分由合唱团演唱的大歌、独唱或对唱的小歌、以及边弹边唱的琵琶歌等类型。内容有以民间传说故事为题的叙事大歌，有歌唱爱情的抒情歌。侗族合唱队演唱的大歌多以套计算。一套中有的包括几首，有的包括几十首不等，估计侗族合唱大歌的蕴藏量有一万多套。图为榕江县晚寨侗族姑娘们在演唱琵琶歌。
