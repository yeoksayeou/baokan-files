    Large and Small Transportation Tools Each Show Their Abilities
    The Broad Masses of Lüda Engage in Transportation, Significantly Improving Transport Efficiency

    (By our newspaper) Lüda city is vigorously engaging in transportation by the whole people, comprehensively utilizing various transportation tools, and significantly improving transportation efficiency, creating important conditions for smooth material exchange and ensuring a leap forward in production in the first quarter.

    After New Year's Day this year, the Lüda Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized the broad masses to work hard and cleverly, launching a mass movement centered on improving loading and unloading efficiency and shortening the turnaround time of trains and ships at stations and ports. The main purpose of this movement is to strive to transport iron, coal, machinery, wood, and other materials from the three northeastern provinces supporting Shanghai and other places as quickly as possible from trains to ships for transport; at the same time, to promptly distribute production and living materials from other places supporting Liaoning to the needed departments and various commercial outlets. The all-people transportation movement in Lüda city has effectively strengthened the organization of various transportation methods. Dalian Seaport and railway departments are implementing unified planning and unified dispatching, accelerating the turnover of vehicles and ships. Dalian Railway Station pre-groups each train entering the port according to the type of goods, so that the train can be directly driven to the designated location in the port for unloading, greatly reducing the vehicle's stay in the port. The trains departing from the port are also organized as much as possible according to light and heavy vehicles, creating conditions for the station to speed up vehicle dispatch. In order to quickly collect and distribute the materials transported in and out by vehicles and ships, a mighty short-distance transportation team has also been organized to work day and night. Under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, the city's major factories and consigning units have established transportation headquarters, adopting many measures such as mechanized loading and unloading and automobile trains to strengthen short-distance transportation; in the case of insufficient short-distance transportation capacity, factories, troops, government organizations, schools, and rural people's communes in the suburbs of the city have temporarily dispatched hundreds of cars and thousands of horse-drawn carts and a large number of other transportation tools to support the transportation department; during the rush transportation of Spring Festival materials, commercial departments organized mass transportation teams to transport goods from ports and stations directly to wholesale departments or commercial outlets and residents' doors as much as possible without entering warehouses, in order to save transportation power and facilitate consumers.

    Strengthening loading and unloading power and improving loading and unloading efficiency are the main keys to accelerating vehicle and ship turnover. The Municipal Party Committee organizes manpower from factories, enterprises, government organizations, troops, and schools every day in a planned way to support the loading and unloading work of ports and stations. Many factories, such as Dalian Shipyard, have transferred loading and unloading machinery to ports and stations for use; recently, various transportation departments have launched a mass technical revolution climax around improving loading and unloading efficiency. The Dalian Port Authority has organized the masses to realize port sliding, vehicle-ization, and indigenous mechanization. The entire port has produced more than 100 small cars, more than 60 sets of aerial slides, and six sets of underground slides, greatly improving loading and unloading efficiency. In the past, when loading and unloading soybeans, a strong laborer could carry up to 150 kilograms at a time, but with the use of a pulley, he can transport 300 kilograms at a time, and old workers and women can use it.

    Since the launch of the all-people transportation movement in Lüda, vehicle and ship turnover and transportation efficiency have been significantly improved. After the train entering Dalian Station drives into the port, the time from unloading and loading to leaving Dalian has been shortened from an average of 28 hours in the first half of January to less than 7 hours at present; the volume of short-distance transportation in the city has increased by more than doubled compared with the same period last year.

    大小运输工具各显其能
    旅大广大群众办交通，运输效率显著提高
    本报讯　旅大市大搞全民办交通，综合利用各种运输工具，显著提高了运输效率，为畅通物资交流，保证第一季度生产跃进创造了重要条件。
    今年元旦过后，中共旅大市委动员广大群众苦干巧干，展开了以提高装卸效率，缩短火车、轮船在车站、港口停留时间为中心的群众运动。这个运动的主要目的是力争最快速度将东北三省支援上海等地的钢铁、煤炭、机械、木材等物资，由火车运来后及时装上轮船运出；同时将外地支援辽宁的生产和生活物资及时分散到需要部门和各商业点。旅大市全民办交通运动，有效地加强了各种运输方式的组织工作。大连海港和铁路部门实行统一计划，统一调度，加快了车船周转。大连车站将进港的每列列车，都事先按货物品种分别编组，使列车可直接开到港口指定地点卸货，大大减少了车辆留港时间；由港口开出的列车也尽量作到按轻车和重车分别编组，为车站创造了加快车辆调动的条件。为了将车、船运出运入的物资迅速集散，一支千军万马、声势浩大的短途运输队伍也组织起来日夜奔忙。在市委统一领导下，市内各主要厂矿和托运单位都成立了运输指挥部，采取装卸机械化、汽车列车化等许多措施，加强短途运输；在短途运输力量不足的情况下，厂矿、部队、机关学校和市郊农村人民公社都临时调出了数百辆汽车和上千辆马车及大量其他运输工具，支援运输部门；商业部门在抢运春节物资中，组织了群众运输队，把港、站来的货物尽量不入仓库，直接运到批发部门或商业点、居民门口，以节约运输力量，便利消费者。
    加强装卸力量，提高装卸效率，是加速车船周转的主要关键。市委有计划地每天组织工厂企业、机关、部队、学校的人力，支援港口和车站的装卸工作。大连造船厂等许多工厂都抽调出装卸机械，交由港口车站使用；各运输部门最近围绕提高装卸效率，掀起了群众性的技术革命高潮。大连港务局组织群众实现港口滑道化、车子化和土机械化，全港已制成小车百余台、空中滑道六十多套，地下滑道六套，大大提高了装卸效率。过去装卸大豆时，一个强劳动力一次最多能扛一百五十斤，使用滑车一次能运三百斤，而且老工人和妇女都能使用。
  旅大全民办交通运动开展以来，车船周转和运输效率已显著提高。进入大连车站的火车开进港口后，由卸货装货到驶出大连的时间，已由一月上半月平均二十八小时，缩短到目前的七小时以下；市内短途运输量较去年同期增长了一倍多。
