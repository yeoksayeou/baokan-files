    Whipping the Horse to Build Power Stations Faster
    By Our Correspondent Huang Jun

    How to accelerate the construction of the power industry? Besides grasping the manufacture of power equipment, what should the power industry itself do? In this regard, various regions created many new advanced experiences last year.

    Last year, many power design departments extensively carried out mass movements, not only fully mobilizing the masses within the design departments, but also opening their doors and inviting relevant personnel from production units, construction units, construction units, scientific research departments, etc. to participate in discussions, thereby greatly improving the speed and quality of design.

    For example, the Wuhan Electric Power Design Institute adopted the mass line method of "Four Greats and Three Lists" in the design of several projects, changing the past practice of a few people proposing plans and a few people reviewing and finalizing them. The so-called "Four Greats" means launching the masses to speak out freely, air views fully, write big-character posters, and conduct great debates in an engineering design. By adopting this approach, all kinds of novel design schemes emerged in less than ten days. The so-called "Three Lists" means that each department analyzes, studies, sorts out, and summarizes the design schemes related to its own projects proposed by the masses, puts forward several schemes and its own recommended scheme, and counts it as the first list, which is submitted to the whole institute to participate in the second list of airing views. After the second list of airing views began, emphasis was placed on carrying forward the spirit of collectivism, not only to carefully air views on the engineering schemes they were responsible for, but also to thoroughly and meticulously air views on the projects made by other departments. In order to air views on major issues in a deep and thorough way, special airing view sessions were also organized. After the second list of airing views, the design institute sorted out and compiled a more complete and well-argued preliminary plan, and then invited relevant departments outside the institute to conduct large-scale airing of views, writing of big-character posters, and great debates to determine the third list of plans. After the design plan was determined, in order to test whether it was practical, each department also organized shock brigades for special experiments and organized the masses to conduct large-scale experiments. In order to affirm the technical achievements of the project, correct shortcomings and errors, and further improve the design quality, the institute also adopted the "Four Greats" and "Three Lists" methods to conduct comprehensive scientific analysis, summary evaluation, and acceptance. The first list was for each design department to accept the engineering design schemes that had been initially affirmed. During the acceptance, not only were the principle issues checked, but also detailed appraisals were made of the quality of the drawings, calculation data, and other minor issues. The second list was based on the first list, and then organized all professional and technical personnel in the institute to universally review the design quality of each project. Through this method, the masses put forward many opinions from different perspectives. In addition to affirming the original 107 new technologies, they also supplemented 104 new experiences and new technologies. Compared with the projects designed by the institute in the first half of the year, the cost was generally reduced by about 40%, and the quality was greatly improved.

    The Beijing Survey and Design Institute saved more than 22,000 tons of steel through mass discussions and technical innovation movements in the design of the Liujiaxia project last year. From January 8th to 14th this year, focusing on the Liujiaxia and Shangmaling projects, they mobilized the masses to further study measures to save steel, and saved more than 1,200 tons of steel on the premise of ensuring quality.

    Solving the surveying and design problem does not mean that the speed of the entire power construction can be accelerated and the quality can be improved; it also depends on the construction and installation situation. How can we ensure quality and accelerate construction and installation work? Many regions created very good experiences last year. Some areas used local materials to build earth-rock dams when building dams, and promoted advanced methods such as underwater dumping and large-scale blasting and directional blasting, and carried out a technical revolution movement centered on tool reform, which greatly improved work efficiency, reduced costs, and ensured quality. For example, the construction unit of the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station handed over the main projects and specific requirements to the masses for large-scale airing of views and great debates, and launched a red flag competition to compare with the advanced and catch up with the advanced, forming a mass movement to contribute ideas and suggestions to generate electricity early and reduce costs, so that the power station repeatedly advanced the original scheduled power generation date in 1961, and strived to shorten the construction period by two years, and determined to install an additional generating unit, increasing the installed capacity from 580,000 kilowatts to 652,000 kilowatts, while the project cost was reduced by 45%. Guangdong Electric Power Engineering Company carried out a "local, simple, and mass" technical revolution movement centered on machinery manufacturing, and manufactured more than 200 pieces of machinery such as cranes, electric winches, and welding machines, solving many difficulties in construction.

    In the past, it took two to three years to build a 100,000-kilowatt hydropower station, but now it can be built in one year. In the past, it took one to two years to build a 25,000-kilowatt to 50,000-kilowatt thermal power station, but now it only takes half a year to complete.

    快马加鞭建设电站

    怎样加速电力工业的建设？除了抓紧制造电力设备以外，电力工业本身应该怎样办？在这方面，去年各地创造了很多新的先进的经验。
    去年许多电力设计部门广泛开展群众运动，不仅充分发动设计部门内的群众，还打开大门，请生产单位、建设单位、施工单位、科学研究部门等有关人员参加讨论，因而大大提高了设计的速度和质量。
    例如，武汉电力设计院在好几项工程设计中，采取了“四大、三榜”的群众路线的方法，改变了过去由少数人提出方案、少数人审查定案的习惯。所谓“四大”，就是在一个工程设计中发动群众大鸣、大放、写大字报、大辩论。他们采取这种做法，不到十天功夫，各色各样的新颖的设计方案都出来了。所谓“三榜”，就是各室把群众提出来的有关自己工程的设计方案，分析研究、整理归纳，提出几个方案和自己推荐的方案，算作第一榜，提交全院参加第二榜鸣放。二榜鸣放开始以后，特别强调发扬集体主义精神，不仅要认真鸣放自己担负的工程方案，而且要深入细致地鸣放别室作的工程。为了对重大问题鸣放得深透，还组织了专题鸣放。经过第二榜鸣放，由设计院整理编制出较为完善、论证较为充足的初步方案，接着邀请院外的有关部门进行大鸣大放、写大字报、大辩论，确定第三榜方案。设计方案确定后，为了考察它是否实用，各室还纷纷组织了专题试验的突击队，组织群众大搞试验。为了肯定工程的技术成就，纠正缺点和错误，进一步提高设计质量，这个院还采取“四大”“三榜”的办法全面进行科学分析，总结评比和验收。第一榜由各设计室对初步肯定下来的工程设计方案进行验收。验收时不仅检查原则问题，而且对图面质量、计算数据、及其他细小问题也作出详细的鉴定。第二榜是在第一榜的基础上，再组织全院各专业技术人员普遍审查各个工程的设计质量。通过这样的方法，群众从不同角度提出了许多意见，除了肯定原来拟定的一百零七项新技术外，又补充了一百零四项新经验和新技术，同这个院上半年设计的工程相比，一般都降低了造价40％左右，而且质量也大大提高。
    北京勘测设计院去年在刘家峡工程的设计中，通过群众讨论，开展技术革新运动，节约了二万二千多吨钢材，今年1月8日至14日，他们以刘家峡和上马岭两工程为重点，又发动群众进一步研究节约钢材的措施，在保证质量的前提下，又节约了钢材一千二百多吨。
    勘测设计问题解决了，不等于整个电力建设的速度就能加快，质量就能提高；还要看施工和安装的情况如何。怎样才能既保证质量，又加速施工和安装工作呢？去年不少地区创造了很好的经验。有的地区在兴建水坝时，就地取材，采用土石坝，推广水中倒土和大爆破、定向爆破等先进方法，并开展了以工具改革为中心的技术革命运动，大大提高了工效，降低了造价，保证了质量。例如，新安江水电站的建设单位，把主要工程项目和具体要求交给群众大鸣大放大辩论，开展比先进、赶先进的红旗竞赛，形成了为提早发电、降低造价的群众性献计献策运动，使电站由原定1961年发电的日期一再提前，力争缩短工期两年，并确定多装一台机组，装机容量由五十八万瓩增到六十五万二千多瓩，而工程造价降低了45％。广东电力工程公司开展以机械制造为中心的“土、简、群”技术革命运动，自己制造了吊车、电动卷扬机、电焊机等机具二百多件，解决了许多施工中的困难。
    过去，一个十万瓩的水电站，需要建设二到三年，现在一年就可以建成。过去建设一个二点五万瓩到五万瓩的火电站需要一年到两年，现在只需要半年就可以完成了。
