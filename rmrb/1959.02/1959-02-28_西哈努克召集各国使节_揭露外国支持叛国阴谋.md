Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, February 27th: The Cambodia News Agency reported today that Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Sihanouk said yesterday that without foreign aid, the conspiracy to carve up Cambodia by bringing together Dap Chhuon, Sam Sary, and Son Ngoc Thanh would not have been possible.

Prince Sihanouk made these remarks in Siem Reap. Yesterday, he invited all diplomatic envoys to Cambodia and members of the International Control Commission in Cambodia to view testimonies regarding Dap Chhuon's conspiracy, supported by foreigners, to undermine Cambodia's neutrality.

He said that there was no doubt that Dap Chhuon's conspiracy involved some foreigners. He added, I am not asking the diplomats present to intervene; I only hope that the major powers will allow Cambodia, a small country devastated by war and poorly equipped, to live peacefully.

Subsequently, Prince Sihanouk read some materials indicating Dap Chhuon's relationship with foreigners, as well as the confessions of two South Vietnamese radio experts arrested at Dap Chhuon's residence. Prince Sihanouk said that these Vietnamese had entered Siem Reap without Cambodian entry visas. They carried six boxes containing several new transmitters and receivers for contact with foreign countries. Then, he read several telegrams.

Prince Sihanouk then led everyone present to visit Dap Chhuon's residence. In the basement were modern weapons and ammunition, high-powered broadcasting equipment, and receivers and transmitters still in boxes, received by Dap Chhuon. The two South Vietnamese men were also there. In the basement, there were also two hundred and seventy kilograms of gold bars that Dap Chhuon had received from foreign countries.

    西哈努克召集各国使节
    揭露外国支持叛国阴谋
    新华社金边27日电　据柬埔寨通讯社今天报道，柬埔寨首相西哈努克亲王昨天说，如果没有外国援助的话，把琼·莫舒皮、桑·萨里和山玉成纠集起来瓜分柬埔寨的阴谋就不可能存在。
    西哈努克亲王是在暹粒讲这番话的。昨天，他在那里邀请所有驻柬埔寨的外交使节和柬埔寨国际委员会委员们观看了关于琼·莫舒皮在外国人支持下进行破坏柬埔寨中立的阴谋的证词。
    他说，毫无疑问，琼·莫舒皮的阴谋牵涉到一些外国人。他又说，我不要求在场的各位外交家进行干涉；我只希望，大国将许可受到战争破坏并且装备很差的柬埔寨这个小国和和平平地过日子。
    接着，西哈努克亲王念了一些表明琼·莫舒皮同外国人的关系的材料，以及在琼·莫舒皮住宅逮捕的两名南越无线电专家的供词。西哈努克亲王说，这些越南人没有柬埔寨的入境签证擅自进入暹粒。他们随身带了六只箱子，里面装有几台新的发报机和收报机作为同外国联系之用。然后，他又念了几段来往电报。
    西哈努克亲王随后带领所有在场的人到琼·莫舒皮的住宅去参观。在地下室里存有琼·莫舒皮收到的现代武器和弹药、强电力广播设备和仍然放在箱子里的收报机和发报机。那两名南越人也在那里。在地下室中还有琼·莫舒皮从外国收到的二百七十公斤金条。
