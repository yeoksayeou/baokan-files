    The Budding Steel City on the Danube River
    By our correspondent Wang Chongjie
    The chimneys of the Danube Iron and Steel Works relentlessly spew smoke into the sky, while the motors of the textile mills hum with urgent rhythm. Wide, orderly streets are proudly lined with rows of brand-new buildings, complete with well-equipped stores, restaurants, and schools. There are also modern theaters, clinics, and sports fields. The kindergartens resound with the happy laughter of children. On construction sites, workers hum labor songs under the direction of giant cranes, determined to make their beloved city grow non-stop, every minute and every second. In this young city on the blue Danube, enthusiasm for production, construction, and creation burns everywhere!

        High Buildings Rise From the Ground
    Traveling downstream from Budapest along the Danube, about seventy kilometers away, on the right bank of the river, lies the emerging city—Stalinvaros.
    Nine years ago, this was just a small village called Dunapentele. A few dilapidated houses stood surrounded by grasslands for years. The yards of farmers contained haystacks blackened by rain. A few fruit trees grew around the village, and fishing nets dried on the riverbank. Life in the village flowed slowly and peacefully, like the waters of the Danube. At that time, no one imagined that a modern industrial city would appear here in just a few years.
    The construction of Stalinvaros fully demonstrates the creative power and socialist enthusiasm of the Hungarian working people.
    When the state decided to build a large steel mill here in the summer of 1950 (the first year of the First Five-Year Plan) to meet the needs of industry, it received enthusiastic support from the people throughout the country. Outstanding engineers, skilled technicians, and farmers from all over rushed to participate in the construction of the new city.
    Millions of young people also actively responded to the call of the Communist Youth League, coming from villages and cities, factories and schools, quickly mastering construction techniques and becoming a vital force in the construction of the new city.
    Hundreds of factories across the country also strongly supported the construction of the new city, completing the machines and equipment ordered by the Danube Iron and Steel Works ahead of schedule.
    Such a large-scale construction project was unprecedented in Hungary. The young Hungarian People's Republic's ability to successfully carry out the construction of a modern industrial base is inseparable from the fraternal assistance of the Soviet people. One thousand Soviet engineers participated in the design of the steel mill. Hungarian construction workers also learned advanced labor methods from Soviet Stakhanovite workers. For example, the Soviet mason Maximinko quickly taught Hungarian masons to use the circular assembly line bricklaying method, which increased their work efficiency by one or two times. The Soviet Union also provided various construction machines and the latest steel mill equipment. The iron sand used by the steel mill will also be mostly supplied by the Soviet Union. Therefore, Hungarian friends always say that Stalinvaros is the crystallization of Hungarian-Soviet friendship when talking about this city.
    Thanks to the hard work of the builders day and night and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, buildings and factories quickly grew on the wilderness of the Danube River.
    "Looking at the buildings, factories, and neat streets that suddenly appeared on the flat ground, even we who personally participated in the construction of the city from the beginning feel it's a miracle," said Fabijan Deže, an old worker at the Danube Iron and Steel Works, to the reporter when recalling the construction situation a few years ago.

        A New Steel Base
    The Danube Iron and Steel Works, which began construction nine years ago, has now become a modern, large-scale metallurgical complex. Eleven production departments have been put into operation, including two blast furnaces, three open-hearth furnaces, a coking plant, a beneficiation plant, a machine repair plant, a refractory brick and tile plant, a chemical plant, and a power plant. The number of employees has reached 6,550.
    According to statistics, the steel produced in the last three years alone could be used to manufacture a motorcycle for every resident in the country. The coking plant can save the country nearly $14 million in imported metallurgical coke each year. In addition, it can produce 150 million cubic meters of gas annually for factories and residents. After the gas pipeline to Budapest is completed, it can also supply gas to the residents of the capital. The chemical plant can supply agriculture with thousands of tons of chemical fertilizers each year. The chemical products produced here are not only for domestic needs but also exported in large quantities. The machine repair plant not only ensures the repair of the steel mill's machines and meets the needs for tools but also produces many high-quality machines. The workers at this plant also manufacture new types of coal grinding machines for our country. The power plant here is one of the largest in the country. In addition to meeting the needs of the city, it also supplies electricity to the central region of Hungary.
    In 1958, the Danube Iron and Steel Works produced more than 400,000 tons of pig iron, more than 200,000 tons of steel, more than 400,000 tons of coke, more than 4,000 tons of ammonium sulfide, more than 1,200 tons of sulfur...
    Last year, the enthusiastic labor competition, technological innovation, and increased production and conservation campaign launched by the workers of the entire plant achieved great results. Within a year, the employees of the plant provided 1,107 inventions and rationalization proposals, of which 444 have been put into production and practical application, increasing production for the country by more than 24 million forints.
    At the end of 1958, the workers of the Danube Iron and Steel Works voluntarily organized socialist shock brigades. The shock brigades not only had specific production tasks and targets but also had the task of developing technology and continuously improving political awareness. The achievements of the shock brigades were announced weekly in the factory's newspaper, greatly promoting the development of production.
    More than 60% of the workers at the Danube Iron and Steel Works are young workers. They actively responded to the initiative of the young people at the Csepel Iron and Steel Works in Budapest and widely launched the "Young Professional Master" competition in the plant, which rapidly improved the production skills of the vast number of young people.
    Currently, all employees of the plant are racking their brains to tap their potential and strive to successfully complete production and construction tasks and complete the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

            Worker-Director
    In an interview with Comrade Borowski Abrul, the director of the Danube Iron and Steel Works, the reporter learned that he was a pioneer in the construction of Stalinvaros. He initially participated in the work of selecting the site for the city and the factory. Later, when the government decided to start building a large-scale steel mill in the wilderness of the Danube River according to the design drawings, he was appointed as the director. For the past nine years, he has been leading the production and construction work of the Danube Iron and Steel Works.
    Some might assume that before taking on the role of leader of such a modern metallurgical complex, Comrade Borowski must have received advanced training or had leadership experience?
    No, before participating in the construction of Stalinvaros, Comrade Borowski was an old worker at the Ganz Locomotive and Wagon Factory in Budapest, where he worked continuously for twenty years.
    When talking about his past life, Borowski told the reporter that he was born into a working-class family and had a very hard childhood, never having the opportunity to attend school. In order to survive, he was forced to work like a beast of burden for capitalists from a very young age. At that time, there were few opportunities to improve his skills during the labor process. Until the national liberation in 1945, he had been working as an auxiliary worker at the Ganz factory. After liberation, he quickly improved politically and technically, and later everyone elected him as the workshop director.
    Comrade Borowski did not shrink in the face of the new tasks given to him by the Party and the state. He immediately threw himself into intense work and study, even though he knew that he would encounter many difficulties in taking on the leadership of such a large-scale modern metallurgical complex. In addition to humbly learning from workers and technicians in his work, he also began studying at the correspondence school of the Budapest University of Technology. After a busy day at work, he was always busy studying late into the night, sometimes staying up all night to study a problem or make engineering charts. On Sundays, when others were happily taking vacations after a week of work, he was always diligently studying all day long.
    With the development of the city, Comrade Borowski also grew rapidly. In 1954, he graduated from the University of Technology, obtaining systematic professional scientific knowledge. However, he was never satisfied with his personal work and academic achievements. In order to further improve himself and do his work better, he also joined the correspondence school of the Budapest University of Economics two years ago.
    The workers of the steel mill say that we don't need to go to the director's office to find him. We can see him in the workshop and on the construction site at any time, and problems can be solved quickly. Due to his love of labor and high sense of responsibility, Comrade Borowski has a very clear understanding of the production and construction situation and existing problems in the factory.
    Closely relying on the leadership of the Party and the strength of the collective, always going deep into reality, and constantly arming himself with scientific knowledge—this is the reason why an ordinary worker can be competent in leading a large-scale metallurgical complex like the constantly expanding and developing Danube Iron and Steel Works.

             New City, New People, New Life
    Comrade Tapolczai Jenő, the chairman of the City Council, introduced the current situation of the city to the reporter. He said that Stalinvaros not only has a large-scale metallurgical complex but also light industry. More than 1,500 women are working in textile and clothing factories. The total annual output value of small local industries also exceeds 70 million forints.
    By 1958, Stalinvaros had built a total of 4,744 well-equipped residences, housing 35,000 people. There are now eighty stores, a large hotel, a central clinic, and four outpatient clinics in the city, as well as fourteen nurseries and kindergartens.
    In addition to seven primary and secondary schools, the city also has a metallurgical technical college, a music school, and a ballet school.
    In terms of cultural facilities, there are two cinemas, a theater, an open-air theater with a capacity of more than 2,000 people, three libraries, a cultural palace, and a happy park. There is also a museum, displaying ancient relics excavated during the construction process.
    Juhasz János, the secretary of the City Party Committee, added that in just a few years, Stalinvaros has not only built large factories and new buildings but also formed a collective of new life. Millions of construction workers and farmers, engineers and steelworkers, teachers and doctors came here from all corners of the country. Initially, what connected these strangers was only their common work and workplace. For a long time, they regarded this new city as their temporary residence, always rushing back "home"—their original city and village—on Sundays and holidays.
    But common labor, common worries, and joys gradually united millions of people into an organic whole. They developed a deep love for the city they had built with their own hands—their new home. People became close friends in the common struggle. Young builders got married here and had children, and grandparents slowly moved from afar to this new home. Stores and theaters had regular customers, children happily studied in new classrooms, and people cheered in unison for the achievements of their city's football team and cultural troupe... Everyone is proud of the creation of collective strength—the new city, and everyone hopes to do their best to build this first socialist industrial city even better!
    Yes, with the development of the city, the builders themselves and the spiritual outlook of the people have also undergone tremendous changes. This is a point that the reporter felt particularly deeply when talking with the residents of Stalinvaros.
    For example, Szász Antal used to be a poor farmer. Before liberation, he was grateful if he could just make a living by working and not suffer from hunger and cold. Now he has become a steelmaking worker at the steel mill. He has not only mastered complex steelmaking technology but also become a person with great political and cultural accomplishments. He is a member of the Socialist Workers' Party, often concerned about major international and domestic affairs, actively publicizing the Party's policies, and using his personal exemplary actions in his daily work to ensure the completion of production tasks.
    Reading books, newspapers, and listening to the radio have become habits of Szász Antal. In his spare time, he often goes to the movies and listens to operas with his wife and children. The life of the new generation is even more different. In addition to receiving a general education in ordinary schools, they can also go to music schools to study music and ballet schools to study dance according to their interests...

                   Magnificent Prospects
    In Stalinvaros, from the secretary of the City Party Committee and the chairman of the City Council to ordinary workers and residents, everyone can tell you about the city's construction plans and prospects.
    By 1963, another 4,500 residences, many new schools, theaters, nurseries, and kindergartens will be built, and the population will increase to about 60,000. This means that the residential area and population will almost double compared to now.
    Stalinvaros will not only be a base for heavy industry, but light industry will also be fully developed. Within five years, textile and clothing factories will be expanded, and large-scale paper-making complexes and food processing plants will be built.
    The second coking plant of the Danube Iron and Steel Works will be put into production in the second half of next year, so that 70% of the country's metallurgical coke can be solved domestically, greatly reducing imports. The coal tar and other workshops of the chemical plant will also start production next year.
    At the end of next year, the hot rolling workshop of the steel mill will begin production, and the cold rolling workshop will start operation in 1963. In this way, 400,000 tons of steel can be produced annually, and it can be processed into steel plates. The Danube Iron and Steel Works will become the country's first-class metallurgical enterprise, with a complete cycle of production processes (ironmaking—steelmaking—rolling) and equipment that makes full use of waste materials. Undoubtedly, this will bring Hungarian machine-building industry into a new stage of development. (Attached picture)

    多瑙河畔新兴的钢铁城
    本报记者  王崇杰
    多瑙钢铁厂林立的烟囱不停地把煤烟喷吐向高空，纺织厂的马达节奏紧迫地响着。宽大整齐的街道两旁骄傲地耸立着一排排崭新的楼房，这儿是设备完善的商店、饭厅和学校，那儿是现代化的剧院、诊疗所和运动场。幼儿园里洋溢着孩子们愉快的笑声。建筑工地上，工人们在巨大的起重机的指挥下哼着劳动的歌曲，他们要使心爱的城市分秒不停地成长。在这蓝色多瑙河畔年青的城市里，到处都燃烧着生产建设和创造的热情！
        高楼平地起
    从布达佩斯乘船沿着多瑙河向下游驶去，经过七十公里之后，在河右岸不远的地方就是新兴的城市——斯大林瓦罗什。
    九年前这儿只是一个名叫多瑙班泰莱的小小的村庄。几所陈旧的房子长年地处在草原的包围中，农户的院子里放着被雨淋得发黑的禾草堆，村周围有几棵果树，河岸上晒着渔网，村里的生活像多瑙河水一样缓缓地平静地流着。那时谁也没想到几年之后这儿会出现一个现代化的工业城。
    斯大林瓦罗什的建设充分表现了匈牙利劳动人民的创造力量和建设社会主义的热情。
    当1950年（第一个五年计划的第一年）夏天，国家为了满足工业的需要决定在这里建造大型的钢铁厂时，得到了全国人民的热烈支持。各地优秀的工程师、熟练的技术工人和农民都纷纷地赶来参加了新城市的建设工作。
    千万个青年也积极响应了党团的号召，从乡村和城市，从工厂和学校来到这里，迅速地掌握了建筑技术，成了新城市建设的生力军。
    全国几百个工厂也大力支持了新城市的建设，都提前制成了多瑙钢铁厂预定的机器和设备。
    这样大规模建设工程在匈牙利是前所未有的。年青的匈牙利人民共和国能够胜利地进行现代化的工业基地的建设是和苏联人民兄弟般的援助分不开的。有一千个苏联工程师参加了钢铁厂的设计工作。匈牙利的建筑工人并且学习了苏联斯塔哈诺夫工作者先进的劳动方法。例如，苏联泥瓦工人马克西明科在这里很快就教会了匈牙利泥瓦工人使用循环流水作业砌砖法，使他们的工作效率提高了一两倍。苏联并且提供了各种建筑用的机器和最新式的钢铁厂的设备。钢铁厂用的铁砂大部分也将由苏联来供给。所以，匈牙利朋友们在谈到这个城市时，总是说斯大林瓦罗什是匈苏友谊的结晶。
    由于建设者日夜地苦干和苏联无私地援助，一片片的楼房和工厂在这多瑙河畔的原野上迅速地成长起来。
    “望着一片片在平地上突然出现的楼房、工厂和整齐的街道，就连我们这些从一开始就亲自参加了城市建设工作的人也感到是奇迹。”多瑙钢铁厂的老工人法比扬·杰泽回忆到几年前的建设情况时对记者这样说。
        新的钢铁基地
    九年前开始兴建的多瑙钢铁厂今天已成了现代化的大型的冶金联合企业。已经投入生产的有两个炼铁炉、三个马丁炉、炼焦厂、选矿厂、机器修配厂、耐火砖瓦厂、化学厂和发电厂等十一个生产部门。职工人数达到六千五百五十人。
    据统计，仅最近三年来生产的钢就可以为全国居民每人制造一辆摩托车。炼焦厂每年可为国家节约将近一千四百万美元的冶金焦炭的进口，另外每年可以生产一亿五千万立方公尺的煤气供工厂和居民使用，在通向布达佩斯的输煤气管建成后，还可以供首都居民使用。化学工厂每年可供给农业几千吨化肥，这里出产的化学成品除供国内需要外，还要大量出口。机器修配厂不但能保证钢铁厂机器的修配工作和满足工具的需要，而且出产很多质量很好的机器。这个厂的工人还为我国制造新式的磨煤的机器。这里的发电厂是全国最大的发电厂之一，除满足本市的需要外，还供给匈牙利中部地区用电。
    1958年多瑙钢铁厂就生产了四十多万吨生铁，二十多万吨钢，四十多万吨焦炭，四千多吨硫化铵，一千二百多吨硫磺……
    去年全厂的工人热烈地展开的劳动竞赛、技术革新和增产节约运动获得了很大的成绩。一年内，厂内的职工就提供了一千一百零七项创造发明和合理化建议，其中四百四十四项已投入生产和实际运用，为国家增产了两千四百多万福林。
    1958年末，多瑙钢铁厂的工人们自愿地组织了社会主义突击队，突击队不仅有具体的生产任务和指标，而且有发展技术和不断提高政治觉悟的任务。突击队的成绩每周都在工厂的报纸上公布，大大地推动了生产的发展。
    多瑙钢铁厂60％以上是青年工人，他们积极响应了布达佩斯切佩尔钢铁厂青年的倡议，在厂内普遍地开展了“青年专业能手”竞赛运动，使广大青年的生产技术得到了迅速的提高。
      目前全厂职工正在开动脑筋发挥潜力，为胜利完成生产建设任务，提前完成三年计划而斗争。
            工人厂长
    在与多瑙钢铁厂厂长博罗夫斯基·阿布鲁 同志交谈时，记者了解到他是建设斯大林瓦罗什的尖兵。最初他就参加了选择建城建厂地点的工作。后来，当政府决定按着设计图样在这多瑙河畔的原野上开始建设大型的钢铁厂时，他就被委任为厂长。九年来他一直领导着多瑙钢铁厂的生产和建设工作。
    大概有人会以为，在担任这样一个现代化的冶金联合企业的领导人之前，博罗夫斯基同志一定受过高深的训练或有过领导工作经验吧？
    不，在参加斯大林瓦罗什的建设工作之前，博罗夫斯基同志是布达佩斯甘兹机车车辆厂的老工人，在那里他连续工作了二十年。
    在谈到往年的生活情况时，博罗夫斯基对记者说，他出生于工人家庭，童年生活很苦，根本没有上学的机会。为了生活，他很早就被迫牛马似的为资本家劳动。那时在劳动过程中也很少有提高技术的可能，直到1945年全国解放时，他在甘兹工厂一直做辅助工。解放后，他在政治上和技术上都很快地得到了提高，后来大家选他作车间主任。
    博罗夫斯基同志在党和国家给予他的新任务面前并没有畏缩，他立即投入了紧张的工作和学习，虽然他知道要担任这样一个大规模的现代化的冶金联合企业的领导工作将会遇到很多困难。他除了在工作中谦逊地向工人和技术人员学习外，并且开始在布达佩斯工业大学的函授学校学习。在白天紧张的工作之后，深夜里他总是忙于学习，有时为钻研某个问题或制作工程图表常常通宵不睡觉。星期天，当别人在一周的劳动之后都快乐地度假日的时候，他也总是整天地苦学。
    随着城市的发展，博罗夫斯基同志也迅速地成长起来。1954年他在工业大学毕了业，获得了系统的专业科学知识。但是，他从来不满足于个人工作和学习上的成绩，为了进一步提高自己，把工作做得更好，两年前他又参加布达佩斯经济学院的函授学校学习。
    钢铁厂的工人们说，我们找厂长用不着到他的办公室里去找他，在车间，在工地，随时都可以看到他，问题也很快地就得到解决。由于热爱劳动和高度的责任感，博罗夫斯基同志对厂内的生产建设情况和存在的问题都掌握得非常清楚。
    紧紧地依靠党的领导和集体的力量，永远深入实际和不断地用科学知识武装自己，这就是一个普通的工人所以能够胜任像多瑙钢铁厂这样不断扩大和发展的大型冶金联合企业的领导工作的原因。
             新城新人新生活
    市议会主席塔波耳察伊·耶诺同志向记者介绍了目前城市的概况。他说，斯大林瓦罗什不仅有大规模的冶金联合企业，并且还有轻工业。纺织厂和服装厂里有一千五百多个妇女在工作。小型的地方工业生产每年的总产值也超过七千万福林。
    到1958年为止，斯大林瓦罗什共建筑了四千七百四十四套设备完善的住宅，有三万五千人住在这些住宅里。现在城里有八十家商店、一个大旅馆、一个中央诊疗所和四个门诊部，还有十四个托儿所和幼儿园。
    全市除七所中小学外，还有冶金技术专科学校、音乐学校和巴蕾舞学校。
    在文化设备方面有：两个电影院、一个剧院、一个容纳两千多人的露天剧场、三个图书馆、一个文化宫和快乐公园。此外还有一个博物馆，陈列着在建设过程中挖掘出来的古代的遗物。
    市党委书记尤哈斯·亚诺什补充说，在短短的几年内，斯大林瓦罗什不仅建筑起了大的工厂和新的楼房，而且形成了新生活的集体。千万的建筑工人和农民，工程师和钢铁工人，教员和医生从全国各个角落来到这里，起初连接这些陌生人的只是共同的工作和工作地点。他们很长一段时间都把这新的城市看作是自己临时的住址，在星期天和假期总是赶回“家”——自己原来的城市和乡村去。
    但是共同的劳动、共同的忧虑和欢乐逐渐地把千万人紧密地结合成一个有机的整体。他们对自己亲手创建起来的城市——新的家乡产生了深深的爱情。人们在共同的斗争中变成了亲密的朋友。青年建设者在这里结了婚，生了孩子，爷爷奶奶也慢慢地从远方搬到了这新的家乡。商店和剧院有了固定的顾客，孩子们满意地在新的教室内学习着，人们也异口同声地为自己城市的足球队和文工团的成绩而欢呼……大家都为集体力量的创造——新的城市而感到骄傲，每个人也都希望尽力把这第一个社会主义的工业城建设得更美好！
    是的，随着城市的发展，建设者本身和人们的精神面貌也发生了巨大的变化。这是记者在与斯大林瓦罗什居民交谈时感到特别深刻的一点。
    例如，萨斯·安塔耳过去是一个贫苦的农民，解放前他只要能靠劳动混口饭吃，不挨饿受冻就谢天谢地了。如今他成了钢铁厂的炼钢工人，他不仅掌握了复杂的炼钢技术，而且成了一个在政治和文化上很有修养的人。他是社会主义工人党的党员，经常关心国际国内的大事，积极宣传党的政策，并且在日常工作中以个人的模范行动来保证生产任务的完成。
    读书、看报和听广播已成了萨斯·安塔耳的习惯。空暇的时间他也常跟自己的妻子和儿女去看看电影和听歌剧。新生一代的生活就更不同了，他们除了能在普通的学校受到一般的教育外，还可以根据自己的爱好到音乐学校去学音乐，到巴蕾舞学校去学舞蹈……
                   宏伟壮丽的前景
    在斯大林瓦罗什，从市党委书记和市议会主席到普通的工人和居民，每个人都可以给你讲讲城市的建设计划和远景。
    到1963年还要再建筑四千五百套住宅、很多新的学校、剧院、托儿所和幼儿园等，居民将增加到六万人左右。这就是说，住宅面积和人口差不多都将比现在增加一倍。
    斯大林瓦罗什将不仅是重工业的基地，轻工业也将得到充分的发展。五年内将扩建纺织厂和服装厂，建成大型的造纸联合企业和食品加工制造厂等。
    多瑙钢铁厂明年下半年第二号炼焦厂将投入生产，这样全国冶金焦炭的70％就可以由国内自己解决，大大减少进口。化学工厂的煤焦油等车间明年也将开工生产。
    明年年底，钢铁厂的热辗车间将开始投入生产，1963年冷辗车间将开工。这样一来，每年就可能生产四十万吨钢，并且可以加工制成钢板。多瑙钢铁厂将成为全国第一等的冶金企业，有着完整的循环生产过程（炼铁—炼钢—辗压）和充分利用废料的设备。无疑，这将使匈牙利的机器制造工业进入一个新的发展阶段。（附图片）
