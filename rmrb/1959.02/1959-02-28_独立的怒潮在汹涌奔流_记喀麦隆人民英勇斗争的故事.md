    The Tide of Independence is Surging
    ——A Story of the Heroic Struggle of the Cameroonian People
    By our correspondents Wang Boqing and Yu Minsheng

    In Cameroon, the tide of independence is surging. The French colonialists are attempting to maintain their increasingly shaky colonial rule with barbaric tortures and bloody massacres. However, the more brutal the colonialists are, the more determined the people's resistance becomes. Today, the armed struggle of the Cameroonian people is advancing victoriously.

    Recently, this reporter interviewed Mr. Sande, a representative of the fighting Cameroonian people, in Beijing. He told us many stories of the heroic struggle of Cameroon. These stories deeply moved us.

    Train Derailment

    In Cameroon, 30% of the land area is dense forest, and the Cameroonian guerrillas completely control these large forests. They use the dense, shady jungle as their base, recuperating and launching attacks on the enemy.

    Once, the guerrillas destroyed two kilometers of railway in the Makak area, preventing the enemy from using the line for two months. Later, the enemy repaired the railway, preparing to transport more troops for retaliation. Upon hearing this news, the guerrillas were even more determined and resolved to teach the enemy another lesson.

    Before the enemy train arrived, the guerrillas removed the spikes, leaving the rails lying as they were. Then, they hid in the forest, waiting for the opportunity.

    A train carrying 150 enemy soldiers arrived. When the train reached the rail without spikes, the locomotive twisted and turned, followed by a loud crash, and the entire train went topsy-turvy. As the surviving colonial troops crawled out of the carriages in panic, the guerrillas ambushed in the nearby jungle opened fire, wiping out the entire invading colonial force.

    Cleverly Capturing the Enemy

    One day six months ago, two guerrillas devised a clever plan, intentionally allowing themselves to be captured by two French colonial army captains. These two French officers were overjoyed and wanted to take the two "prisoners" to claim credit and receive a reward. However, when they passed a log bridge over a river on the way, one of the guerrillas suddenly jumped into the water and disappeared. The French officers anxiously opened fire at the bubbles in the water. Unexpectedly, after a while, the guerrilla poked his head out of the water again. Seeing that he was still alive, the French officers became furious and fired another volley at him. What about the guerrilla? He had already skillfully dived to the bottom of the water and swam to another location. In this way, he rose and sank in the water, leading the two French officers to fire round after round, exhausting all their ammunition. At this moment, the guerrilla swam ashore with his comrades and captured the two French officers, asking them whether they wanted to live or die. The two dumbfounded French officers had lost all their bravado and had no choice but to hand over their empty guns and obediently become "prisoners."

    The Old Woman Selling Peanuts

    The struggle of the Cameroonian guerrillas for national independence and freedom is receiving increasing support from the broad masses of the people. This has enabled the guerrillas to thrive like fish in water, exerting greater power and inflicting heavier blows on the colonial army.

    A month ago, the guerrillas learned that the police station in the Loum area had a lot of weapons. In order to get their hands on those weapons, they planned to attack the police station. However, the guerrillas were not very clear about the geographical situation near the police station, and a direct assault might result in losses. What to do? At this time, the guerrillas received help from an old woman and successfully implemented the attack plan.

    Disguised as a vendor, the old woman risked her life and brought peanuts to sell near the police station every day. The enemy soldiers were happy to have something to eat, but they never expected that this old woman was the "eyes" of the guerrillas. The alert old woman took the opportunity to memorize the location of the doors and windows of the police station and the nearby roads, and reported everything to the guerrillas. As a result, the guerrillas, based on the old woman's information, broke into the police station one dark night with lightning speed, killing four enemy soldiers, capturing six alive, and seizing more than 100 automatic rifles to equip themselves.

    The "Stoker"

    Once, the French colonial army surrounded the guerrillas in the Baham area. A commander in the guerrilla team had to retreat. However, the security zone was so large that it was too difficult to get out. What to do? He believed that the people would help him. So, he sent someone to a nearby city to contact a train driver there. Inspired by the great cause of national justice, the train driver bravely agreed to hide the commander in his driver's cab to leave the security line.

    On a scheduled evening, as the driver's train traveled on a predetermined route, he emitted three whistle signals to indicate contact, followed by three flashes of a flashlight on the side of the road to indicate a response. The train then reduced its speed. The inspectors on the train never imagined that at that moment, the guerrilla commander hidden on the side of the road had boarded the driver's cab and become the "stoker."

    New fuel was added to the furnace, the fire burned brightly, and the train sped forward. In this way, the guerrilla commander safely escaped danger and returned to his post to continue fighting.

    The Guide

    In a place called Eséka, a group of colonial troops forced an old man to lead them into the forest to attack the guerrillas. The old man agreed to guide the fifty colonial troops, which made the colonial troops very happy.

    After entering the vast forest with towering ancient trees, the old man led the colonial troops through rugged and uneven paths, sometimes crossing streams and sometimes climbing slopes...

    Time passed hour after hour, and the darkness of nature began to envelop the earth. The colonial troops were hungry and tired and were beginning to suspect this old "guide" when they saw wisps of smoke rising from the forest above a river in front of them.

    Pointing to the rising smoke, the old man said to the colonial troops, "It is possible that the guerrillas are cooking there, and more people are likely to be exposed. You wait a moment, I will go and scout around and come back to take you there." The colonial troops did not doubt the old man's sincerity. So, the old man crossed the river with a splash, causing ripples on the calm water...

    The foolish beasts sat on the ground, leaning against the tree trunks, waiting! Waiting! The earth was completely dark, but the old man had not returned.

    Suddenly, there was a crackling sound of gunfire, and bullets flew around them. The fifty colonial beasts were surrounded by guerrillas. Some fell, some bled profusely, and some were captured alive. Only fifteen beasts escaped by chance.

    The Unfailing Banner

    Finally, let us record another story of the "unfailing banner" to wish the Cameroonian people victory in their struggle for independence!

    Yes, as Mr. Sande said, May 25, 1955, is unforgettable for the fighting Cameroonian people.

    It was on this day that the French colonialists dissolved the Cameroon People's Union in order to suppress the Cameroonian people's liberation movement. However, the people's struggle did not stop, but continued more resolutely.

    A year passed, and May 25, 1956, arrived. On the morning of this day, when the French colonial troops stationed in the port city of Douala woke up, the flags of the People's Union, with a black crab on a red background, replaced the flags of the colonialists on all the buildings in the city. Many telephone poles were also plastered with color offset-printed flags of the black crab on a red background. Even the tall flagpole in front of the French colonialist "trusteeship" headquarters was replaced with a flag of the black crab on a red background.

    Who had replaced so many flags? When the French colonialists drove police cars around searching for "guerrillas," they did not see even a shadow.

    From then on, every year when May 25 arrived, the colonialists dispatched troops and police the night before to be on high alert. However, on this day of May 25, even more flags of the black crab on a red background replaced the flags of the colonialists, flying all over Cameroon.

    This is the banner of the struggle for freedom and independence, this is the unfailing banner!

    独立的怒潮在汹涌奔流
    ——记喀麦隆人民英勇斗争的故事
    本报记者　汪波清　于民生
    在喀麦隆，争取独立的怒潮正在汹涌奔流。法国殖民者企图用野蛮的酷刑和血腥的屠杀来维护日益动摇的殖民统治。然而，殖民主义者越残暴，人民的反抗也越坚决。今天，喀麦隆人民的武装斗争正在胜利的道路上向前发展着。
    最近，记者在北京访问了战斗的喀麦隆人民的代表桑德先生。他对我们谈到了不少喀麦隆英勇斗争的故事。这些故事使我们深深受到感动。
    火车出轧
    在喀麦隆有30％的土地面积是大森林，喀麦隆游击队全部控制了这些大森林。他们以遮天蔽日的丛林为营，休养生息，出击敌人。
    有一次，游击队一举在马卡克地方拆毁了两公里铁路，使敌人在两个月内不能通车。后来，敌人修复了铁路，准备运更多的敌人来进行报复。游击队员听到这个消息以后，更是斗志昂扬，决心再给敌人一个大教训。
    趁敌人火车来到之前，游击队员们把道钉拔掉，让铁轧原样躺在那里；然后，他们隐藏在森林里，待机而行。
    一辆载着一百五十名敌兵的列车驶来了。当火车行到没有道钉的轧上时，车头扭了几扭，接着“哗啦”一阵巨响，整个火车来了个“驴打滚”。当车厢里活着的殖民军惊慌地爬出来的时候，埋伏在附近丛林里的游击队员一齐开了枪，全部消灭了这股企图进犯的殖民军。
    机智擒敌
    六个月以前的一天，两个游击队员定了个妙计，有意让自己落在法国殖民军队的两个上尉手里。这两个法国军官得意忘形地要带着两个
  “俘虏”去报功领赏。但在途中经过一条河的独木桥的时候，有一个游击队员突然跳入水中不见了，法国军官急得瞧着水泡乱开起枪来。谁料过了一会以后，那个游击队员又把头探出水面，法国军官见他还活着，气得又向他放了一阵枪。游击队员呢？他早已敏捷地潜入水底，游到另一个地方去了。就这样，他在水里一沉一浮，引得那两个法国军官一阵又一阵地开枪，把子弹消耗了个精光。这时，那个游击队员却游上岸来和他的战友一起，捉住了两个法国军官，问他们要死还是要活。呆若木鸡的两个法国军官的威风早已一扫精光，只好交出空枪，乖乖地作了“俘虏”。
    卖花生的老妈妈
    喀麦隆游击队为民族独立自由进行的斗争，越来越得到广大人民的支持，这就使游击队如鱼得水，发挥了更大的威力，给殖民军队以更沉重的打击。
    一个月以前，游击队员探听到鲁姆地方的警察派出所有不少武器。为了把那批武器搞到手，他们计划要袭击派出所。但是游击队对派出所附近的地理情况不很清楚，如果硬打上去，可能会遭到损失。怎么办呢？这时候，游击队得到了一位老妈妈的帮助，胜利地实现了袭击的计划。
    这位老妈妈乔装一个小贩，不顾生命危险，每天带着花生到派出所附近叫卖。敌兵们见有东西吃，可乐啦，他们万没有料到这位老妈妈就是游击队的“眼睛”。机警的老妈妈趁机把派出所门窗的位置和附近的道路，一一记在心里，回去全都报告了游击队。于是，游击队员就根据老妈妈的情报，在一天黑夜，用神速的动作打进派出所，杀死四个敌兵，活捉来六个，缴获了一百多枝自动步枪，装备了自己。
    “司炉工”
    有一次，法国殖民军队包围了巴酋普地方的游击队，游击队中的一个指挥员必须撤退出去。但是警戒区是那样大，要走出去是太困难了。怎么办呢？他相信人民是会帮助他的。于是，他派人到附近的一个城市，和那里的一个火车司机取得了联系。在民族大义的感召下，火车司机勇敢地答应在他的司机室里掩护这位指挥员离开警戒线。
    在预定的一天晚上，当这位司机的火车行驶在一段预定的线路上时，他放出了三声表示联络信号的汽笛，接着路旁闪亮了三次手电光表示回答，火车这时减低了行驶速度。车上的检查人员想也没想到，就在这个时刻，隐藏在路旁的游击队指挥员已经登上了司机室，当了“司炉工”。
    新的燃料投入炉内，炉火熊熊燃烧，火车在急速飞驰。就这样，游击队的指挥员安然脱险，重新走上继续战斗的岗位。
    向导
    在一个叫埃塞卡的地方，一群殖民军强迫一个老人带他们到森林去袭击游击队。老人答应为这五十个殖民军带路，这使殖民军非常高兴。
    进入古木参天的茫茫大森林以后，老人带着殖民军在崎岖不平的小道上串来串去，一会儿跨过溪流，一会儿又攀登坡岭……
    时间，一个小时又一个小时的过去，大自然的黑幕已开始笼罩大地。殖民军又饿又累，正在怀疑这位年老的“向导”时，只见前面横着一条河流的森林上空，升起了袅袅青烟。
    指着那四起的炊烟，老人对殖民军说：“那里可能就是游击队在作饭，人多容易暴露，你们先等一下，我去打探一下回来再带你们去。”殖民军毫不怀疑老人的真诚，于是，老人噗通、噗通地渡过河去了，平静的水面上掀起了一个个的浪花……
    愚蠢的野兽们，坐在地上，依在树干上，等啊！等啊！大地已漆黑一团，但还不见老人回还。
    突然，响起了噼噼啪啪的枪声，子弹就在身边飞舞。五十个殖民野兽被游击队员团团包围了，有的倒下了，有的鲜血直流，有的被生擒了，只有十五个野兽侥幸逃命。
    不倒的旗帜
    最后，让我们再记下一个“不倒的旗帜”的故事来预祝喀麦隆人民取得独立斗争的胜利吧！
    是的，正像桑德先生所说的，1955年5月25日，对于战斗着的喀麦隆人民来说这是难忘的。
    就是这一天，为了镇压喀麦隆人民的解放运动，法国殖民主义者解散了喀麦隆人民联盟。然而，人民的斗争没有停止，而是更加坚持地进行了。
    一年过去了，1956年5月25日来临了。这天的清晨，当驻在杜阿拉港口城市的法国殖民军醒来的时候，全城所有的建筑物上，红底黑蟹的人民联盟的旗帜代替了殖民者的旗帜在飘扬。许多电线杆上也贴上了套色油印的红底黑蟹的旗帜。就连法殖民主义者“托管”总部门前高高的旗杆上，也被换上了红底黑蟹的旗帜。
    是谁给换上了这许多旗帜呢？当法国殖民者驱着警车到处搜捕“游击队员”的时候，却连一个影子也没有看到。
    从此以后，每年当5月25日到来的时候，殖民者就在前一天晚上出动军警，严加戒备。但是，在5月25日这一天，却有更多的红底黑蟹的旗帜代替殖民者的旗帜飘扬在喀麦隆各地。
    这是为自由和独立而斗争的旗帜，这是不倒的旗帜！
