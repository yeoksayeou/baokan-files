How a society treats its elderly is one of the yardsticks for measuring the progress of that society.

In Britain's population of over five million, more than five million elderly people live on pensions. The plight of these elderly people is widely recognized as a disgrace to Britain.

A minimum living expense for an elderly person is at least seventy or eighty shillings a week. This does not include rent, and it requires them to not get sick, not buy cigarettes or alcohol, and have no cultural entertainment. But an old man's pension is only fifty shillings a week; his wife, as a dependent, can only receive thirty shillings. Therefore, the daily life of the elderly can only be: porridge for breakfast, bread or potatoes for lunch, sometimes with a little fish or meat, and a little bread with a dab of margarine for afternoon tea, which replaces dinner.

Winter is the hardest to endure. In England, the winter rarely sees the sun, and it is bitterly cold. Many old people cannot afford enough coal for heating, let alone gas stoves or electric stoves. Their way of keeping warm is to go to bed early and sleep with their heads covered. Some homes have automatic gas stoves, but each shilling coin only provides an hour of warmth. If an elderly person needs eight hours of heating a day, their entire pension would not be enough for heating.

In some churchyard cemeteries, you can often see frail old people sitting silently on benches by the roadside.

I approached an old lady, sat down beside her, and greeted her.

She said, "This year's fog is going to kill me." She told me that during the great fog of winter 1952, more than 4,700 people died in London alone in one week, the vast majority of whom were elderly people with respiratory or lung problems.

I asked her if she had seen a doctor. She said, "Going to see a doctor requires a long walk. And who knows how long you have to wait there. There are many patients, the air is bad, waiting there makes you feel more and more uncomfortable and irritable. Not only will the illness not be cured, but you will add to your troubles. I have long stopped looking for this kind of trouble. Anyway, I can't endure this kind of suffering for much longer!"

Among the more than five million pensioners, more than one million are completely helpless single elderly people. Most of them are old widows. Their situation is the most tragic.

Every year, some lonely elderly people are burned to death in house fires without anyone knowing, or poisoned in bed by gas leaks, and discovered long after death.

Due to physical weakness and lack of care, many elderly people lie in bed waiting to die, and many others become mentally ill due to loneliness and spend their remaining years in mental hospitals.

The inhumane treatment suffered by the elderly has aroused increasing indignation in society. The elderly themselves are protesting, and people with a sense of justice are appealing for the pension that damages human dignity to be raised to a level that can maintain a minimum standard of living, that is, at least seventy shillings a week.

British officials also admit that current pensions are indeed too low. But some people even have the audacity to say: "In any case, we can still give the elderly some pension!" Their words seem to be boasting that the British ruling class is particularly charitable. But tracing the origins, the British government accumulates this fund by deducting about ten shillings a week from the wages of every British worker during their employment as national insurance premiums. Only after paying a certain period and a certain amount of insurance premiums can they be entitled to a pension upon retirement.

If a worker starts working at the age of eighteen and retires at the age of sixty-five, deducting ten shillings a week from their wages, they can accumulate more than one thousand pounds during their entire forty-seven years of employment, without interest. If the pension is fifty shillings a week after retirement, this accumulation can last for nine years, until they are seventy-four years old. Obviously, not every elderly person can live to seventy-four. It can be seen that the pension comes from the workers themselves, it comes from deductions from the working class's living expenses, and it is not taken out by the ruling class.

In order to consolidate the rule of the bourgeoisie, to alleviate the growing public outrage, and especially to win votes before the general election, the two servants of this class, the Conservative Party and the Labour Party, are making various gestures one after another, dressing themselves as philanthropists, and each promoting their own pension plan.

The main points of the plan recently promoted by the Conservative Party are to encourage private enterprises to establish pension systems as much as possible, and to minimize the government's burden. Those who enjoy government pensions must pay a certain amount of money each week in proportion to their wages during employment, and receive pensions of different levels according to the amount of total payment, with the highest being six pounds a week. But this will not be achieved until fifty years later, in 2008.

According to this plan, the current situation of more than five million people receiving meager pensions will not be improved in any way, and will only become more miserable as prices rise. The only one who benefits is the government, because the contributions to the national pension fund for those with weekly wages of more than nine pounds are much higher than the current ones.

According to the results of a study by a famous insurance statistician, assuming that a worker can really take out the same amount of money every week, but instead of giving it to the government, he gives it to any insurance company for private insurance or as bank savings, in the end, he will get much more than the pension stipulated by the government.

The Labour Party's pension plan is that if the Labour Party wins the general election, the Labour government will increase the weekly pension for each single elderly person to sixty shillings.

Another part of the plan is to pay different levels of pension fund according to the amount of wage income of employed workers, using the method of affixing stamp tax tickets every week. Fifty years later, the elderly whose wages are around the average income level can receive a pension equal to about half of their weekly salary at retirement.

According to the Labour Party's plan, the pension seems to have been slightly increased. But even if the Labour Party comes to power and fulfills its promises immediately, what the elderly can get is still not enough to maintain a truly adequate life. The other part of the plan is even more pie in the sky, a distant and uncertain prospect.

In a basement in East London, I visited Mr. Dick Goy, who is eighty years old and an executive member of the National Federation of Pension Recipients Associations. He said, "I have written to Prime Minister Macmillan, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Conservative Party Chairman Hailsham, inviting them to try to live on fifty shillings a week."

I asked him what the elderly people thought of the two parties' pension plans. He said, "They are all scams! Generally, people who have retired are not interested in these tricks at all. The Conservative Party never pays attention to us until the general election, when they want us old people to vote for them. The Labour Party has some nice words and makes some promises, but past experience tells us that they don't fulfill their promises very much. Once bitten, twice shy."
      "The sole purpose of our elderly organization is to constantly demand an increase in pensions. Because pensions are never enough. We have worked all our lives when we could work, and in the last few years when we are unable to work, we have the right to live like human beings. The government cannot afford it. There are more than eight hundred lords in the House of Lords, who nominally do not receive salaries, but each person has a daily allowance of sixty-three shillings, which is more than an elderly person's weekly pension. The difference is that those hereditary and ennobled lords can get tax exemption for their allowances, while we who receive pensions have to pay (income) tax." London Newsletter

    晚景凄凉的英国工人

    一个社会怎样对待老人，是衡量这个社会进步的标尺之一。
    在英国的五千多万人口当中，有五百多万老人是靠领养老金过活的。这些老人生活的困窘已经被公认是英国的耻辱。
    一个老人最起码的生活费每星期至少需要七、八十个先令。这还不包括房租，而且要保证不生病，不买烟、酒，没有任何文化娱乐。而一个老头儿的养老金每星期只有五十个先令；他的妻子，作为家属，只能领到三十个先令。因此老人们每天的生活只能是：早餐一顿粥，午餐一顿面包或土豆，有时加上一点点鱼或肉，下午喝茶的时候吃一点面包，涂上一点人造黄油，这就代替了晚餐。
    冬天是最难熬的。英国的冬天很少见太阳，阴寒刺骨，许多老人家买不起足够的煤来取暖，更谈不到用煤气炉或电炉。他们御寒的办法是早早上床，蒙头睡觉。有些人家虽然装有自动煤气炉，但每次投进一个先令的硬币只能取暖一小时，如果每天取暖八小时，一个老人的全部养老金还不够取暖用呢。
    在有些教堂旁边的坟地里，你常常可以看到衰迈的老人一声不响地呆坐在路旁的长椅上。
    我走近一位老太太，在她身边坐下来，向她问好。
    她说，“今年的雾快要把我害死了”。她告诉我，1952年冬天大雾，一个星期之内光伦敦就死了四千七百多人，其中绝大多数是气管或肺有毛病的老年人。
    我问她看过医生没有。她说：“去看病要跑很远的路。到那里不晓得要等多久。病人多，空气坏，等在那里，越等越不舒服，越生气，不但病没治好，反而添了烦恼。医生每开一种药，病人就得花一个先令，吃了也好不了。我早就不去找这种麻烦了，反正这样的罪我也受不了多久了！”
    在五百多万领养老金的老人中，有一百多万是完全无依无靠的单身孤老。其中多数是老寡妇。他们的处境是最悲惨的。
    每年都有些孤老因为房屋失火无人知晓地被烧死，或者因为煤气走漏，毒死在床上，死后很久才被人发现。
    由于身体衰弱无人照顾，有许多老人卧在病床上等死，还有许多老人因为生活太寂寞，精神失常，在精神病院里度完了余年。
    老人们所遭受的不人道的待遇已经在社会上引起了日益增长的愤慨。老人自己在抗议，有正义感的人在呼吁，必须把损害人的尊严的养老金提高到能够维持起码的生活水平，即每星期至少七十个先令。
    英国的官员们也承认目前的养老金的确太少。但也有人竟厚着脸皮说：“无论如何，我们还能给老年人一些养老金呀！”言下似乎是在夸耀英国的统治阶级是特别慈善的。但追究一下来龙去脉，英国政府积累这笔基金的办法是：每一个英国工人在就业期间，每星期要从工资中扣除约十先令左右作为国民保险费。只有在交过一定时期和一定份额的保险费之后，退休时才有权领养老金。
    如果一个工人从十八岁开始就业，六十五岁退休，每个星期从工资中抽出十先令，在他四十七年的全部就业期间不计利息就可以积累一千多英镑。如果退休后每星期以五十个先令为养老金，那么，这一笔积累就可以维持九年，直到他七十四岁的时候。显然不是每一个老人都能活到七十四岁的。可以看出，养老金是羊毛出在羊身上，它出自克扣工人阶级的生活费，并不是统治阶级拿出来的。
    为了巩固资产阶级的统治，为了缓和日益高涨的公愤，尤其是为了在大选之前骗取选票，这个阶级的两个仆人，保守党和工党，便一个跟着一个地作出种种姿态，把自己装扮成慈善家的模样，各自宣传自己的一套养老金计划。
    最近保守党所宣传的计划要点是尽量鼓励私营企业建立养老金制度，把政府的负担减到最小限度。享受政府养老金的必须根据工资的高低在就业期间按比例每周交纳一定的钱数，根据交纳总额的多少，领取等级不同的养老金，最高的每周可以有六镑。但这要到五十年后即2008年才能实现。
    根据这个计划，目前五百多万领着数目低微的养老金的人，处境将得不到任何改善，只会随着物价的增长而更加悲惨。唯一有利可图的是政府，因为凡是周薪九镑以上的每周为国家养老基金提出的贡献要比现行的高得多。
    根据一个著名的保险统计会计师研究的结果，假定一个工人每星期真的能拿出同样数目的钱，但不是交给政府，而是交给任何一个保险公司作私人保险或作为银行储蓄，到头来他所能得到的要比政府规定的养老金多得多。
    工党的养老金计划是，如果大选中工党当选，工党政府将使每个单身老人每周的养老金增加到六十个先令。
    计划的另一部分是按就业工人工资收入的多少，每周用贴印花税票的办法缴纳不同等级的养老费基金。五十年后，工资在平均收入水平左右的老人退休后每周可以领到约等于退休时周薪的一半左右的养老金。
    根据工党这个计划，养老金似乎是略微提高了一些。但即或工党上台后诺言立即兑现的话，老人们所能得到的仍然不足以维持真正温饱的生活。计划的另一部分更是画饼充饥，遥遥无期。
    在东伦敦的一个地下室里，我拜访了迪克·高依老先生。他今年八十岁，是养老金领受者协会全国联合会的执行委员。他说：“我已经写信给总理麦克米伦，财政大臣，和保守党主席黑尔什姆，请他们来试试一个星期用五十个先令怎样过日子。”
    我问他老人们对于两党的养老金计划有些什么看法。他说：“都是骗局！一般告老的人对这些花样一点也不感兴趣。保守党不到大选，想要我们老人投他们一票的时候，从来不理我们。工党有些漂亮话，许下一些诺言，但是过去的经验告诉我们，他们是不大履行诺言的。第一次受了骗，第二次就有了戒心。”
      “我们这个老人组织的唯一目的就是不断要求提高养老金。因为养老金从来都是不够的。在可以工作的时候我们工作了一生，当我们无力再工作下去的最后几年里，我们有权利活得像个人的样子。政府并不是花不起钱。贵族院有八百多个老爷，名义上不领薪俸，但每人每天有六十三先令的津贴费，比一个老人一星期的养老金还多。不同的是那些世袭的和加封的老爷们领了津贴可以免税，而我们领养老金的还要交（所得）税”。伦敦通讯
