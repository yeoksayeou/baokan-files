Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 5th: Tianjin workers victoriously completed the January industrial production plan, with the total output value increasing by 79.79% compared to the same period last year, creating a good start for a better and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

At the beginning of this year, under the unified arrangement of the Tianjin Municipal Committee and the leadership of Party committees at all levels, Tianjin's workers summarized the achievements and experiences of last year's Great Leap Forward and discussed this year's Leap Forward plan, immediately launching a competition upsurge to vigorously carry out technological revolution and realize a greater leap forward this year. The 69 factories under the Tianjin Chemical Industry Bureau submitted more than 14,000 technical innovation proposals from January 1st to 28th, an increase of nearly tenfold compared to the same period last year; more than 2,000 of these have already been implemented. Many factory workers also, in response to the temporary shortage of certain raw materials, vigorously engaged in "small indigenous groups" to produce raw materials through self-reliance; vigorously engaged in saving substitutes, comprehensive utilization, improving product design and formulas; and vigorously trial-produced new products to increase product quantity and quality. The nine chemical plants in the Hexi District produced 47 kinds of raw materials in January, basically achieving self-sufficiency.

While carrying out the technological revolution, many factories organized various forms of leap forward competitions. Factories in Hexi, Hebei, Hongqiao and other districts have launched a wave of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. The output value completed by the Tongsheng Chemical Plant in Hongqiao District last year increased seven and a half times compared to the previous year, and this year it is proposed to quadruple it compared to last year; the workers of the Dyeing Chemical Plant No. 6, whose production scale and nature are similar to those of the Tongsheng Chemical Plant, were greatly encouraged after learning about this situation and put forward the slogan of "Catching up with Tongsheng, Surpassing Tongsheng." Both factories completed their January production plans relatively well.

    天津技术革命浪潮汹涌
    一月份工业产值比去年同期增八成
    据新华社天津5日电　天津职工胜利地完成了1月份工业生产计划，总产值比去年同期增长79.79％，为今年更好更全面的跃进创造了良好的开端。
    天津市职工今年初在市委统一布置和各级党委的领导下，总结了去年大跃进的成就和经验，并且讨论了今年的跃进计划，立即掀起了一个大搞技术革命、实现今年更大跃进的竞赛热潮。天津化学工业局所属六十九个工厂，从1日到28日就提出了技术革新建议一万四千多件，比去年同期增长近十倍；其中有两千多件已经实现。许多工厂职工还针对某些原材料暂时供应不足的情况，大搞“小土群”，自力更生生产原材料；大搞节约代用、综合利用、改进产品设计和配方；大力试制新产品等办法提高产品数量和质量。河西区九个化工厂，1月份生产了四十七种原材料，基本上达到自给自足。
    在开展技术革命的同时，许多工厂组织了各种形式的跃进竞赛。河西、河北、红桥等区的工厂掀起了比先进、学先进、赶先进的热潮。红桥区的同生化工厂去年完成的产值比前年增长了七倍半，今年又提出要比去年翻四番；和同生化工厂生产规模、性质相似的染化六厂职工知道这个情况后，受到很大鼓舞，并且提出了“赶同生、超同生”的口号。这两个厂的1月份生产计划都完成得比较好。
