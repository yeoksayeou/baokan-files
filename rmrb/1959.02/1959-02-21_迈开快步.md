    Taking Big Strides
    Wang Pu
    High speed is the soul of the General Line. The Party's set of policies for walking on two legs, as well as the principle of the whole country as a coordinated chess game, are all for building socialism at high speed. Therefore, whether it is production or construction, industry or agriculture, we must strive for high speed. Every soldier fighting on all fronts must have the idea of "fast."
    Fast, of course, is the "fast" in "more, faster, better, and more economical." We cannot think that "fast" means that we cannot be "better and more economical." Being good and economical versus being wasteful does not depend on fast or slow, but on whether we act in accordance with objective laws. When Butcher Ding dismembers an ox, because he has mastered the laws of the ox's muscle and bone structure and follows the grain of the ox's muscles and bones, the blade goes where it should, and the flesh separates from the bones. He can quickly dismember an ox. Butcher Ding's dismembering of oxen is not only fast but also good and economical. He can dismember thousands of oxen without changing a knife for nineteen years, and the blade is still as sharp as if it had just been sharpened. However, those "good butchers" and "family butchers" who do not understand the laws of the ox's muscle and bone structure dismember in a chaotic manner, which is not only slow and inefficient but also wears out the knife (because the knife often hits the bones), so they have to change a knife once a year, or once a month.
  (The story is from Zhuangzi's "Nourishing the Lord of Life" chapter). Of course, our construction and production are different from dismembering oxen. However, the story of "Butcher Ding Dismembering Oxen" tells us a truth: those who act in accordance with objective laws can achieve both more and faster, and better and more economically; those who do not act in accordance with objective laws can achieve neither more nor faster, nor better nor more economically. More and faster and better and more economical, quantity and quality, can be completely unified.
    The idea of fast is not only reflected in advanced planned targets but also in advanced measures and advanced methods. Therefore, with fast targets, there must also be fast measures and fast methods to guarantee them. So, what kind of measures are considered fast measures? What kind of methods are considered fast methods? The measures and methods adopted by Hebei Province to build 400 simple coke ovens with an annual output of 8,000 tons of coke before the end of March are an example. Hebei Province has only two small-scale mechanized coke ovens, with insufficient technical strength and little experience. To overcome this difficulty, they adopted the principle of phased construction, first building experimental furnaces as a base for exploring experience and training construction teams, and then carrying out full-scale development. At the same time, they concentrated experienced engineering and technical personnel and workers to study and formulate furnace-building quality standards and operating procedures, and toured various places to guide furnace building. Their adoption of the method of shortening the front line, concentrating superior forces, and fighting annihilation battles can turn weakness into strength and unfavorable factors into favorable factors, thereby achieving the goal of accelerating construction speed under conditions of insufficient technical strength and experience.
    In order to build our country into a highly modernized socialist power in a not very long historical period, not only must all work be fast, must be at high speed, but also must be fast from beginning to end, must be at high speed. The year's plan lies in spring. Why "lies in spring"? It means that from spring onwards, we must take big strides, be determined, and complete and overfulfill this year's leap forward targets.

    迈开快步

    高速度是总路线的灵魂。党提出的一整套两条腿走路的方针以及全国一盘棋的原则等等，都是为了高速度地建设社会主义。所以，生产也好，建设也好，工业也好，农业也好，都必须力争高速度。在各条战线上奋战的每个战士，都必须有“快”的思想。
    快，当然是多快好省中的快，不能以为快就不能好省。好省和差费，并不决定于快或慢，而决定于是否按照客观规律办事。庖丁解牛，由于掌握了牛筋骨结构的规律，顺着牛的筋骨纹理下刀，刀锋所到，骨肉相离，很快地就肢解好一头牛。庖丁解牛不仅快而且好省，他连解数千头牛，十九年不换一把刀，刀锋仍和刚磨过一样。而那些不懂得牛筋骨结构规律的“良庖”和“族庖”，乱肢解一气，不仅解得很慢，效率低，而且很费刀（因为刀经常碰到骨头上去），所以一年就得换一把刀，或者一月换一把刀。
  （故事见庄子“养生主”篇）。我们搞建设，搞生产，当然跟解牛不一样。但是，“庖丁解牛”这个故事却告诉我们一个真理：凡是按照客观规律办事的，就既能多快，又能好省；凡是不按照客观规律办事的，就既不能多快，又不能好省。多快和好省、数量和质量完全可以统一起来。
    快的思想，不仅表现在先进的计划指标上面，还表现在先进的措施、先进的方法上面。所以有了快的指标，还要有快的措施和快的方法做保证。那么怎样的措施才算快的措施？怎样的方法才算快的方法呢？河北省要在3月底以前，建成四百座年产八千吨焦的简易炼焦炉的措施和方法就是一个例子。河北省只有二座小型的机械化炼焦炉，技术力量不足，经验也不多。为了克服这个困难，他们采取分期分批建设的原则，先搞试验炉，作为摸索经验和培养建设队伍的基地，然后全面开花。同时把有经验的工程技术人员和工人集中起来，研究和制订砌炉质量标准和操作规程，巡回各地指导砌炉。他们采取了缩短战线，集中优势兵力，打歼灭战的方法就可以转弱为强，变不利因素为有利因素，从而在技术力量不足、经验不足的条件下达到了加快建设速度的目的。
    为了在一个不很长的历史时期中，把我国建成为一个高度现代化的社会主义强国，不但各种工作都要快，都要高速度，而且自始至终都要快，都要高速度。一年之计在于春。为什么“在于春”呢？就是说从春天开始就要迈开快的步伐，立定决心，完成和超额完成今年的跃进指标。
