Unquenchable Flames
By Our Staff Commentator

The flames of resistance against colonialism are burning on yet another piece of land on the African continent. In Central Africa, the people of Nyasaland have continued to hold large-scale demonstrations in recent days against British colonial rule, demanding immediate secession from the so-called "Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland" imposed on them by the British colonialists, and to gain complete independence.

Following closely on the heels of the Congo incident, the flames of the African national liberation movement are spreading from west to east, from north to south. In addition to Nyasaland, the people of French Togoland, Portuguese Mozambique, British Central Africa, and East Africa have all taken action. Riots against colonial rule have also occurred in Italian Somaliland. This situation is increasingly and eloquently proving that the colonial system has been fundamentally shaken throughout the African continent and is in the process of rapid disintegration.

Since the end of the 19th century, Britain has established colonial rule in Nyasaland. After the Second World War, in order to strengthen its plunder and enslavement of Central Africa, British colonialists forcibly formed Nyasaland and Rhodesia into a "federation." Thus, for more than half a century, Nyasaland, known as a beautiful and rich water country, has become a paradise for European adventurers and a hell for the kind African people. Several British trusts have seized more than 70% of Nyasaland's land. About 200,000 Africans are forced to sell their labor in the colonialists' plantations at the shockingly low price of less than one pound per month; another 200,000 Africans are driven to Rhodesia to work as miners, becoming a source of super-profits for Anglo-American monopoly capital. The millions of Africans in Nyasaland are struggling on the brink of starvation and disease. In Rhodesia-Nyasaland, a barbaric system of racial segregation and discrimination also prevails, with the more than 96% of the population who are Africans losing almost all political rights. There is no doubt that the people of Nyasaland have the sacred right to break free from the shackles of this colonial "federation" and have every right to demand that Africans govern their own country.

However, faced with the 2.6 million Nyasaland Africans demanding freedom, the terrified British colonialists have once again raised their bloody butcher knives. The British colonialists have dispatched large numbers of troops and police to Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and even deployed "vampire"-style military aircraft. Colonial troops and police are carrying out large-scale arrests and persecution of Africans throughout Nyasaland, using not only batons and tear gas, but also live ammunition to suppress them. In Lilongwe, southern Nyasaland, barbaric colonial troops have already opened fire on unarmed demonstrators, and bloodshed has occurred. These brutal acts by the British colonialists cannot but arouse the anger and protest of the people of Nyasaland and the people of the world.

The British colonialists' attempt to use terror and violence to scare off the righteous and courageous people of Nyasaland is fundamentally impossible. As Hastings Banda, chairman of the Nyasaland African National Congress, rightly said, "What is the use of this? Your (British) troops and police can never solve a political problem, and the current problem is precisely a political problem." As long as colonial rule does not end, the struggle of the people of Nyasaland for national independence will not cease for a single day. Similarly, if this fundamental political problem is not thoroughly resolved, the raging fire of the national liberation movement will not be extinguished for a single day on the vast African continent. We firmly believe that the sun of freedom and victory will surely rise high in Nyasaland and the entire black continent!

    扑不灭的火焰
    本报评论员
    反抗殖民主义的怒火在非洲大陆的又一块土地上燃烧起来了。中非洲的尼亚萨兰人民在这几天里继续举行了大规模的反抗英国殖民统治的游行示威，要求立即脱离英国殖民者强加在他们头上的所谓“罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦”，并获得完全的独立。
    紧接着刚果事件之后，非洲民族解放运动的火焰正从西向东，从北向南蔓延。除了尼亚萨兰之外，法属多哥、葡属莫三鼻给、英属中非和东非的人民都行动起来了。意属索马里兰也发生了反抗殖民统治的暴动。这种形势越来越雄辩地证明，殖民制度在整个非洲大陆已经根本动摇，并且处于迅速瓦解的过程之中。
    从十九世纪末叶起，英国在尼亚萨兰建立了殖民统治；在第二次世界大战以后，英国殖民者又为了加强对中非洲的掠夺和奴役，用暴力强制尼亚萨兰和罗得西亚结成“联邦”。这样，半个多世纪以来，号称美丽富饶的水乡之国——尼亚萨兰变成了欧洲冒险家的乐园，非洲善良人民的地狱。几家英国的托拉斯占有了尼亚萨兰70％以上的土地。二十万左右的非洲人被迫在殖民者的种植园以每月不到一英镑的惊人的廉价出卖劳力；又有二十万左右的非洲人被驱使到罗得西亚去充当矿工，成为英美垄断资本榨取超额利润的源泉。尼亚萨兰的上百万的非洲人挣扎在饥饿和疾病的死亡线上。在罗得西亚——尼亚萨兰，还盛行着野蛮的种族隔离和歧视制度，占96％以上的非洲人几乎丧失了一切政治权利。没有疑问，尼亚萨兰人民有着神圣的权利摆脱这个殖民“联邦”的羁绊，也有完全的权利要求由非洲人自己来治理这个国家。
    但是，面对着要求自由的二百六十多万尼亚萨兰非洲人，惊魂丧魄的英国殖民者又一次举起了血腥的屠刀。英国殖民者调遣了大批的军队和警察密布在罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰，甚至出动了“吸血鬼”式的军用飞机。殖民军队和警察正在尼亚萨兰全境对非洲人进行着大规模的逮捕和迫害，他们不仅使用了警棍和催泪弹，而且已经开始了实弹镇压。在尼亚萨兰南部的里朗圭，野蛮的殖民军队已经向手无寸铁的示威群众开了枪，流血事件发生了。英国殖民者的这种残暴的行为，不能不引起尼亚萨兰人民和全世界人民的愤怒和抗议。
    英国殖民者妄想用恐怖和暴力来吓退正义和英勇的尼亚萨兰人民，这是根本做不到的。尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会主席班达说得对，“这有什么用呢？你们（英国）的军队和警察从来不能解决一个政治问题，而目前的问题正是政治问题。”只要殖民统治一天不结束，尼亚萨兰人民争取民族独立的斗争就一天不会停息。同样，这个根本性的政治问题一天得不到彻底的解决，在辽阔的非洲大陆上民族解放运动的熊熊之火也将一天不会熄灭。我们坚决地相信，自由和胜利的太阳一定要在尼亚萨兰和整个的黑色大陆上高高地升起来！
