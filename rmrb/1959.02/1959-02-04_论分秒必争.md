    On Seizing Every Minute
    Yue Xun
    What is the longest and shortest, the fastest and slowest, the easiest to be overlooked and the most regrettable thing in the universe? It is time. Everyone knows how precious time is to people. Throughout history, there have been countless warnings to cherish time! However, truly cherishing time and achieving "seizing every minute" actually began now and is being practiced by our generation.
    If you are not someone living in a shell, you will see the great leap forward situation in current factories, institutions, communes, and schools, and you will have the impression that we are engaged in a nationwide battle to seize time. The word "fast" is part of our Party's general line. The so-called "fast" refers to time, and now "seizing every minute" has become a common battle cry. We are fighting time to gain steel, machines, and grain... In 1959, the steel production target is eighteen million tons, which means that if last year we produced twenty tons of steel per minute, this year we must produce thirty-four tons of steel per minute. See how much value a minute creates!
  Now, who can fail to calculate the value of these minutes and seconds! Especially recently, the Soviet Union launched a cosmic rocket flying at a speed of 11.2 kilometers per second, which is thousands of times faster than walking, and hundreds of times faster than trains and airplanes. In the future, when we enter the era of photonic spacecraft, we may even reach speeds of hundreds of thousands of kilometers per second. Who can fail to cherish these precious minutes and seconds!
    This battle being waged by our six hundred million people is to make our country advance at high speed. Winning time means winning victory, and only a social system like ours and a people armed with the most advanced ideas can be the masters of time.

    论分秒必争
    越迅
    宇宙间什么东西最久而又最短，最快而又最慢，最易被人忽视而又最令人后悔？这是时间。时间对于人之宝贵是尽人皆知，古往今来有多少惜阴的警语！但是，真正的爱惜时间，做到“分秒必争”，实际上是始于现在，由我们这辈人来实践的。
    如果不是生活在套子里的人，就会看到当前工厂、机关、公社、学校大跃进的形势，就会产生这样的印象：我们是在进行着一场争夺时间的全民性的战斗。“快”字，是我们党的总路线的组成部分。所谓“快”，就是指时间而言，现在“分秒必争”，已经成为普遍的战斗口号。我们在和时间争夺钢铁、机器和粮食……1959年的钢铁是一千八百万吨，也就是说，如果去年每分钟产钢二十吨，则今年每分钟就要产钢三十四吨，请看，一分钟创造的价值有多么大啊！
  现在谁能不算这分、秒的账呢！尤其最近苏联发射的宇宙火箭，以每秒钟十一点二公里的速度飞行，这比起步行已经快了好几千倍，而较之火车、飞机亦快了好几百倍。在将来进入光子宇宙飞船时代，还可能达到每秒钟数十万公里的速度。谁能不珍惜这宝贵的一分、一秒钟呢！
    我们六亿人民进行的这场战斗，就是要我们的国家高速度前进。赢得时间就是赢得胜利，而只有像我们这样的社会制度和以最先进思想武装起来的人民才是时间的主人。
