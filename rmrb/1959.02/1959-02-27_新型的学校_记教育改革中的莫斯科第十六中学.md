A New Type of School

——Notes on Moscow No. 16 Middle School in Educational Reform

By our reporter Cui Yongchang

December 24, 1958, opened a new page in the history of Soviet national education. On this day, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued the law "On Strengthening the Connection Between Schools and Life and Further Developing the Soviet National Education System." At present, all universities, middle and primary schools in the Soviet Union are carrying out educational reforms in accordance with this law. This reform is one of the important measures of Soviet communist construction. Not long ago, we visited Moscow No. 16 Middle School, an experimental point that implemented educational reforms earlier, and many of its experiences are currently being promoted. This school has implemented the eleven-year education system, the seven-year compulsory education has been changed to eight years, and from the ninth grade students implement a work-study program. The students cultivated here not only have a secondary cultural level but also have certain production skills.

	Unforgettable First Lesson

September 1, 1958, was an unusual day for the students of Moscow No. 16 Middle School. From this day on, their school has been changed into a labor middle school with production training. After three years, the ninth-grade students will not only receive a middle school diploma but also a work certificate. With this work certificate, they are qualified to work in any factory. The ninth-grade students, take Sasha and Valya for example, they know that in three years they will become lathe operators. At that time, they will have the ability to operate lathes, and all kinds of metal parts will be made with their hands. At that time, they can proudly say: I am a Soviet worker! Precisely for this reason, after they came to school, they couldn't wait for a new course: "Basic Knowledge of Industrial Production."

The school bell rang, and the students of Class A in the ninth grade sat quietly in the classroom waiting for the new teacher. The door opened, and everyone turned their eyes to the door. Walking in was not an old teacher with glasses, but a rosy-faced, tall and strong worker-like person. After he asked everyone to sit down, he opened a chart and spoke in a loud voice about the achievements of Soviet industry in the past forty years. He also focused on explaining what mechanical manufacturing is and its important role in the national economy. Then he said to everyone: "You all know that not far from our school there is a factory called 'Red Proletarian'. This is the most famous machine manufacturing factory in our entire Soviet Union. The various new-style lathes produced here are not only famous throughout the Soviet Union but have also won praise in the world. In the next three years, you can learn labor in such a large factory. Children, this has to be said to be a kind of happiness. In this factory, you will not only see all kinds of new-style machines but also see many old workers and production innovators who are famous throughout the Soviet Union."

After finishing this passage, the new teacher briefly introduced himself to everyone. He said that his name was Nikolai Mikhailovich Tikhonov, an engineer from the special lathe equipment workshop of the "Red Proletarian" factory. Now, at the invitation of the school, he will teach the course "Basic Knowledge of Industrial Production." Then he asked everyone to start a new line in their notebooks and write down the title of the first lesson: "A Brief History of the 'Red Proletarian' Factory…"

The teacher also talked to everyone about the raw materials needed to manufacture machines. When the teacher asked everyone "What are machines made of?" thirty voices answered in unison: "Steel!" But when the teacher asked everyone how many kinds of steel there were, no one could answer. Many students wanted to answer: "There is only one kind of steel!" But that was not right. The teacher told everyone that there are many different kinds of steel, but for the "Red Proletarian" factory, the most used are: high-carbon steel, structural steel, alloy steel, and high-speed cutting steel. The teacher also introduced several major steelmaking methods and various instruments for testing the quality of steel. After this lesson, the teacher also took everyone to visit the factory's raw material warehouse, let everyone see samples of various steels, and took everyone to the factory laboratory to visit various instruments.

During a class break, we met Comrade Tikhonov, the new teacher, and Comrade Berenev, the principal of No. 16 Middle School and a Meritorious Teacher of the Russian Federal Republic. The two of them briefly told reporters about the school's educational reform.

Comrade Berenev said that at present, there are two classes in each of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh grades in their school that are attending classes according to the new syllabus. The tenth and eleventh-grade students spend half of their time in the factory every week, and the ninth-grade students also often go to the factory to visit and practice. After passing the factory's exam last summer, all of the eleventh-grade students became third-grade workers, and five students were rated as fourth-grade workers. Recently, the tenth-grade students also passed the factory's exam smoothly. These students are studying the lessons of the tenth grade of ordinary schools and are studying production technology in various workshops in the factory as apprentices according to their major. Comrade Berenev also told us about the relationship between the factory and the school. He said that the "Red Proletarian" factory has given the school a lot of help: as early as 1956, when the school decided to strengthen students' production education, the factory helped the school establish a small workshop and an electrical laboratory, and gave the school several lathes and some instruments; in 1957, when the school began to experiment with learning in connection with production, the factory agreed to help the school organize students to practice in the factory, and found ten engineers to serve as teachers for various production courses in the school. Comrade Tikhonov is one of them, and he also serves as the vice-principal of No. 16 Middle School, specializing in the labor learning work of students. We learned about some of his work and agreed to visit the factory the next day.

	Felt the Joy of Labor

The next morning, we came to the "Red Proletarian" factory with Comrade Tikhonov. This is the largest machine manufacturing factory in Moscow. After entering its workshop, we saw the automated production line that had just been installed not long ago. In the lathe equipment workshop, we saw rows of new-style lathes painted with green paint standing on the conveyor belt. The overhead cranes on the roof were rolling back and forth, transporting parts to various work sections. Comrade Tikhonov introduced the labor situation of middle school students here as we walked. He said that before students officially go to the workshop, they must learn the theoretical lessons and technical safety knowledge of their major. The majors currently studied by students are five types: lathe operator, fitter, milling machine operator, grinder, and electrician. Among them, except for fitters who are only boys, there are both boys and girls in the remaining types of work. The major is chosen by the students themselves. The foremen of each workshop are responsible for the students' learning after they come to the workshop. Comrade Tikhonov first took us to the second mechanical workshop, where we saw Belevizantseva, an eleventh-grade female student, working beside a vertical milling machine. She is an eighteen-year-old girl. When we asked her if she liked this job, she replied with a smile: "Now I like this job very much. It was a bit unaccustomed at the beginning, but now it's nothing!" We also asked her how the work quota was being completed. She said: "At the beginning, only 80% was completed, then it rose to 90%, and now it can complete 100% of the quota." She also told us that last summer she was rated as a third-grade milling machine operator after passing the exam, and now the old worker Baidakov is helping her improve her skills and preparing to complete the work of a fourth-grade milling machine operator. Comrade Tikhonov explained to us that the eleventh-grade students are all working very well now. They enjoy the treatment of apprentices in the factory, receive a certain salary every month, and have joined the trade union. We also asked Belevizantseva about her feelings after coming to the factory and her future plans. She said: "I didn't know anything about the factory before. My impression was that the work was very dirty and tiring, but after coming to the factory, I felt the joy of labor. Two or three years ago, I wanted to work for a year or two and then go to college, but now I don't want to leave the factory. My future plan is this: After graduating, I will immediately enroll in the factory's night university or the correspondence course of the Mechanical Manufacturing Institute. In addition, I want to improve my technical level."

Alexeyev, an old worker in this workshop, told us: "After these children from the school entered the factory, they became much more serious because they understood what labor is."

	New Teachers and Old Teachers

After the end of the workshop visit, we talked with Comrade Tikhonov in his office about some of his experiences in participating in educational reform. When visiting the school, we audited his lecture, and the content and method of his lecture left a good impression on us. Therefore, we first asked him to talk about how he mastered "teaching techniques." He said:

"As an engineer, I mastered the second profession - teaching - five or six years ago. At that time, the factory party committee assigned me a social work, asking me to teach amateur technical classes to young workers. At that time, I was completely unfamiliar with this work, but there were many old workers and old engineers in the factory who had experience in this area, so I learned from them. In 1955, our neighbor, No. 16 Middle School, decided to strengthen students' technical education and asked the factory to send people to help teach classes. The factory party committee assigned this task to me. From then on, I often went to the school to teach the children. Now there are nine engineers in the factory besides me who are also part-time production course teachers in the school. To be honest, teaching in school was a bit difficult at the beginning. First of all, there were no textbooks. Everyone had to compile their own teaching materials. Students are different from young workers. They have no production experience, and many things have to be explained from scratch. This requires finding a lot of materials in advance and researching the content of the lectures."

As he spoke, he took out a booklet from his briefcase. This is an outline of a "Basic Knowledge of Industrial Production" course taking a mechanical manufacturing factory as an example, compiled by Comrade Tikhonov. Comrade Tikhonov also told us that when compiling this outline, he received the help of many old teachers from No. 16 Middle School and absorbed many of their valuable experiences. He also told us a lot about this. He said that in order to closely link learning with production, the teachers of all subjects in No. 16 Middle School have added new content to their courses. For example, the language class is like this. In the past, almost all the essay topics for tenth-grade students were related to literature classes, but now the essay topics have been changed. The tenth and eleventh-grade students write their own production diaries every day, writing about their experiences in the factory. The physics and chemistry classes are more closely related to production. Mr. Shedov, a physics teacher in the tenth grade and a Meritorious Teacher of the Russian Federal Republic, leads students to manufacture various electrical instruments and radio parts themselves. Even foreign language teachers have found methods for teaching in connection with production. They found many production textbooks for foreign mechanical manufacturing in the factory and used these materials to let students practice translation.

At the end of the visit, we found Comrade Berenev, the principal of No. 16 Middle School, again. He told us that the current achievements are only a beginning, and there is still a lot of work to be done. But it is from this beginning that we have seen the infinite enthusiasm of Soviet educators for educational reform and the achievements they have made, and we have seen that a new type of labor school is growing.

    新型的学校
    ——记教育改革中的莫斯科第十六中学
    本报记者　崔永昌
    1958年12月24日在苏联国民教育史上打开了新的一页，这一天，苏联最高苏维埃发布了“关于加强学校同生活联系和进一步发展苏联国民教育制度”的法律。目前苏联全国所有的大、中、小学都在按照这项法律，进行着教育改革，这种改革是苏联共产主义建设的重要措施之一。不久前我们访问了莫斯科第十六中学，这是实行教育改革较早的一个实验点，它的许多经验目前正在推广。这个学校已经实行了十一年制教育制度，七年制义务教育已经改成了八年，从九年级起学生们实行半工半读。这里培养出的学生不但具有中等文化水平，并且有一定的生产技能。
        难忘的第一课
    1958年9月1日对莫斯科第十六中学的学生来说是一个不平常的日子，他们的学校从这一天起已经改成了附有生产训练的劳动中学，九年级的学生三年后不只会得到中学毕业证书，并且还会得到一张工作证明书，凭着这张工作证明书他们有资格到任何工厂去工作。九年级的学生，就拿萨沙和瓦利亚来说吧，他们就知道三年以后他们将成为镟工，那时他们将有操纵镟床的本领，而各种各样的金属零件将用他们的双手造成，到那时他们可以骄傲地说：我是苏联工人了！也正因为这个原因，他们来到学校以后才迫不及待地等着一门新的课程：“工业生产基本知识”。
    上课铃响了，九年级甲班的学生安静地坐在教室里等着新教员。门开了，大家把视线都投向门口。走进来的不是带眼镜的老教员，而是一位满面红光、又高又壮的工人模样的人，他让大家坐下来以后，打开了一张图表，用宏亮的声音讲起了苏联工业四十年的成就，并且着重向大家解释了什么是机械制造业和它在国民经济中的重要作用。然后他向大家说：“你们全知道离我们学校不远有个工厂叫‘红色无产者’，这是我们全苏联最有名的一家机械制造厂，这里出产的各种新式车床不但全苏闻名，并且在世界上也获得了好评。在以后三年内，你们就可以在这样一个大工厂里学习劳动，孩子们，这不能不说是一种幸福。在这家工厂里你们不但会看到各种新式机械，并且会看到许多全苏闻名的老工人和生产革新者。”
    讲完这段话以后，这位新教员向大家简单地介绍了一下自己。他说他的姓名是：尼可来·米哈依洛维奇·吉洪诺夫，是“红色无产者”工厂特种车床装备车间的工程师，现在应学校的聘请来讲“工业生产基本知识”这门课。然后他让大家在笔记本上另起一行，写下第一课的题目：“红色无产者”工厂简史……
    教员还向大家讲了制造机器所需用的原料。当教员问大家“机器是什么造的？”的时候，三十张口同声地回答说：“钢铁！”但是当教员问大家钢有几种的时候，大家全答不上来了。很多学生都想回答说：“钢只有一种！”原来这不对。教员告诉大家钢有许许多多种，不过对“红色无产者”工厂来说用的最多的是：高碳钢、结构钢、合金钢和高速切削钢。教员还向大家介绍了几种主要的炼钢法和测验钢的质量的各种仪器。上了这一课以后，教员还带着大家参观了工厂原料仓库，让大家看了各种钢的样品，并且带大家到工厂化验室里参观了各种仪器。
    在一个课间休息的时候，我们见到了这位新教员吉洪诺夫同志和第十六中学校长、俄罗斯联邦共和国功勋教师别列涅夫同志，他们两位向记者简单地谈了一下这个学校进行教育改革的情形。
    别列涅夫同志说，现在他们学校的九、十、十一年级各有两个班按照新的教学大纲上课，十、十一年级的学生每星期有一半时间在工厂工作，九年级的学生也经常到工厂去参观和实习。十一年级的学生在去年夏天经过工厂的考试以后全部成了三级工人，其中还有五个学生被评为四级工人，最近十年级学生也顺利地通过了工厂的考试。这些学生在学校学习着普通学校十年级的功课，在工厂按照专业在各车间做学徒学习生产技术。别列涅夫同志还向我们谈到了工厂与学校的关系，他说“红色无产者”工厂给了学校很大的帮助：还在1956年当学校决定加强对学生的生产教育时，工厂就帮助学校建立了一个小型车间和一个电学试验室，并且给了学校几台车床和一些仪器；1957年当学校开始试验学习联系生产时，工厂答应帮助学校组织学生在工厂实习，并且找到十位工程师来学校担任各项生产课程的教学工作。吉洪诺夫同志就是其中之一，他并且担任了第十六中学副校长的职务，专门负责学生的劳动学习工作。我们向他了解了他工作的一些情况，并且约定第二天到工厂去参观。
    感到了劳动的愉快
    第二天早晨，我们和吉洪诺夫同志一起来到了“红色无产者”工厂。这是莫斯科最大的一家机械制造厂，走进了它的车间以后，我们看到了不久前刚刚装好的自动化工作线，在车床装备车间，我们看到一台台喷好绿色油漆的新式车床立在传送带上，屋顶上的吊车来回地滚动着，给各工段传送着零件。吉洪诺夫同志一边走着一边向我们介绍中学生在这里劳动的情况，他说，学生们在正式下车间以前都要学习好自己专业的理论课和技术安全知识。学生目前学习的专业有五种：镟工、钳工、铣工、磨工和电工，其中除钳工只有男生外，其余各工种男女都有，专业是由学生自己选择的。学生来到车间后的学习由各车间的工长负责，吉洪诺夫同志首先把我们带到了第二机工车间，这里我们看到了十一年级的女学生别列维赞采娃正在一台立式铣床边工作，她是一个十八岁的姑娘，当我们问她喜欢不喜欢这个工作时，她微笑地回答说：“现在我很喜欢这个工作，一开始工作时的确有点不习惯，但是现在已经没什么了！”我们又问她，工作定额完成得怎么样，她说：“一开始只完成80％，后来上升到90％，现在已经能够百分之百地完成定额。她还告诉我们说，去年夏天她经过考试被评定为三级铣工，现在老工人巴依达可夫正帮助她提高技术，准备完成四级铣工的工作。吉洪诺夫同志向我们解释说，现在十一年级的学生全工作得很好，他们在工厂享受着学徒的待遇，每月有一定的薪金，并且加入了工会。我们又问别列维赞采娃她来到工厂后的感想和今后的计划怎样。她说：“以前我对工厂一点儿也不了解，印象里觉得工作很脏很累，但是来到工厂以后，我感到了劳动的愉快。两三年前我还想工作一两年以后马上去考大学，但是现在我已经不想离开工厂了。未来的计划是这样：毕业以后，马上入工厂的夜大学或机械制造学院函授班学习。另外还要提高自己技术水平。”
    这个车间的老工人阿列克谢也夫向我们说：“从学校来的这些孩子进了工厂以后，变得严肃多了，因为他们懂得了什么是劳动。”
      新教员和老教员
    结束了车间的参观以后，我们与吉洪诺夫同志在他的办公室里谈起了他参加教育改革的一些心得。在学校访问的时候，我们曾经旁听了他的讲课，他讲课的内容和讲述的方法给我们留下了很好的印象。因此我们首先请他讲一下，他自己是怎样掌握“教学技术”的。他说：
  “作为一个工程师，我掌握第二种职业——教书，还是五、六年前的事；当时工厂党委分配给我一项社会工作，要我给青年工人们上业余技术课，当时我对这个工作完全不熟悉，但是工厂有许多老工人和老工程师在这方面有经验，我就向他们学习。1955年我们的邻居第十六中学决定加强对学生的技术教育，请工厂派人去帮助讲课，工厂党委就把这一任务交给我负责。从那时起我就经常到学校去给孩子们讲课，现在工厂里除去我以外还有九位工程师在学校里兼任生产课教员。说老实话，在学校里教书一开始是有些困难的，首先是没有课本，大家全要自己编教材，学生们与青年工人不同，他们没有生产经验，许多东西全要从头讲起，这样就需要自己事先找很多材料，研究讲课内容。”
    说着他从皮包里拿出一本小册子，这是吉洪诺夫同志编写的一本以机械制造工厂为例的
  “工业生产基本知识”教程提纲。吉洪诺夫同志还向我们说，在编写本教程提纲时他得到了第十六中学许多位老教员的帮助，并且吸收了他们许多宝贵的经验。他还告诉了我们许多这方面的情况，他说，为了使学习与生产密切联系起来，第十六中学各门功课的教员全在自己课程中增加了新的内容，例如语文课就是这样，从前十年级学生的作文题目几乎全是与文学课有联系的，但是现在作文的题目改了，十、十一年级的学生每天都写自己的生产日记，写自己在工厂里的见闻。物理课、化学课与生产更有紧密联系，十年级物理课教员、俄罗斯联邦共和国功勋教师谢多夫领导学生自己制造各种电学仪器和收音机零件，甚至外文教员也找到了教学联系生产的方法，他们在工厂找到了许多外国机械制造业的生产教科书，从这里找材料让学生们练习翻译。
    在结束访问的时候，我们重新找到了第十六中学校长别列涅夫同志，他向我们说，目前的成绩还只是一个开端，摆在面前还有很多工作要做。但是就是从这个开端中我们看到了苏联教育工作者对教育改革的无限热忱和他们取得的成绩，看到了一个新型的劳动学校正在成长。（附图片）
