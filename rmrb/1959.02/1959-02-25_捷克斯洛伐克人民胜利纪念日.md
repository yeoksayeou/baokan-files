Czechoslovak People's Victory Memorial Day

February 25th of this year marks the eleventh anniversary of the Czechoslovak People's Victory. On this day eleven years ago, under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the working people of Czechoslovakia crushed the conspiracy of the bourgeois reactionaries to organize a counter-revolutionary coup. This victory day is a day of great historical significance for the Czechoslovak people.

In May 1945, the Czechoslovak people were liberated with the assistance of the Soviet Army. In the first post-war National Assembly election in May 1946, the Czechoslovak Communist Party had become the most powerful party and formed a coalition government of parties in the National Front headed by the Chairman of the Czech Communist Party, Gottwald. The task facing the new government at that time was to formulate a series of revolutionary measures, including the formulation of a new constitution, the drafting of the first two-year plan (1947-1948) for the restoration and development of the national economy, and the adoption of many important laws such as the draft of the new land reform law. In terms of foreign policy, the new government also decided to further strengthen and consolidate the alliance with the Soviet Union. However, since the birth of the new Czechoslovakia, the bourgeois reactionaries have been trying to seize power back from the people, eliminate democratic achievements, and restore the capitalist system. At that time, the reactionary forces of the three bourgeois parties holding ministerial positions in the government—the National Socialist Party, the People's Catholic Party, and the Slovak Democratic Party—colluded with some old military officers to plot a political crisis and also drafted a plan to launch an armed rebellion. On February 20, 1948, the reactionary forces began to act. Twelve ministers and two state secretaries from the reactionary parties submitted their resignations to then-President Beneš on that day. They attempted to force other ministers belonging to the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, who held a majority of seats in the government, to resign through this action, in order to establish a so-called caretaker government with the full consent of President Beneš. This government would then organize the upcoming May parliamentary elections, in order to force the Communists out of the government. However, the reactionaries miscalculated. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Czechoslovak people took action. On the 21st, Comrade Gottwald reported the situation at the time to the people at a mass rally of 100,000 people in Prague, calling on the people to unite against the conspiracy of the bourgeois reactionaries. "Let the President accept the resignation of the reactionary ministers, we want a new government of the National Front" became the unanimous slogan of the masses at that time. The people of the whole country rose up to fight against the reactionaries. On this day, action committees including members of various parties began to be organized in the vast cities and villages of Czechoslovakia. Workers' armed forces were also organized. Under the strong pressure of the people, Beneš had to accept the resignation of all the reactionary ministers and remove them from the government.

On February 25th, the new government nominated by Comrade Gottwald was officially established. On that day, Comrade Gottwald said in a speech to the working masses of Prague: "The cause of the people has triumphed, and today will become the most glorious day in our new history." Then the new government passed the new constitution on May 9. In the parliamentary elections on May 30, the parties of the new National Front won, with the Communist Party members occupying an overwhelming majority. In June, Beneš resigned, and Comrade Gottwald was elected President of the Republic amidst cheers from the people across the country. The conspiracy of the bourgeois reactionaries was completely crushed.

The February 1948 events opened a new stage for the Czechoslovak people to smoothly carry out socialist construction. Under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the Czechoslovak people have successfully completed the two-year plan (1947-1948) for the restoration and development of the national economy, the first five-year plan (1949-1953), and the annual plans for 1954 and 1955 in developing the national economy. Since 1956, the Czechoslovak people have begun to implement the second five-year plan. The successful implementation of these plans has enabled Czechoslovakia's industry to develop rapidly and become a highly developed industrial country. For example, its coal production per capita currently ranks third in the world; its steel production has exceeded that of France and Sweden; and its machine tool production has reached the level of the most developed countries in the capitalist world.

In June 1958, the Czechoslovak Communist Party held its Eleventh Congress. The meeting resoundingly called on the entire party and the people of the country to advance towards the victory of socialism. The meeting also laid out specific guidelines and tasks for further vigorously developing the national economy and improving the people's material and cultural living standards. According to the targets proposed by the meeting, it is stipulated that industrial production in 1965 should increase by 90% to 95% compared with 1957, agriculture will approximately double, and personal consumption in 1965 is expected to increase by about 45% compared with 1957, and the housing problem will be basically solved by 1970. The successful completion of these indicators will enable Czechoslovakia to greatly exceed France in terms of per capita output by 1965, and will basically reach the economic levels of West Germany and the United States.

Today, the Czechoslovak people are commemorating the glorious eleventh anniversary of the February events with the mark of continuously achieving new and great victories in socialist construction. The facts of the past eleven years have proved that only under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party can the Czechoslovak people achieve such great achievements.

    捷克斯洛伐克人民胜利纪念日
    今年2月25日，是捷克斯洛伐克人民胜利十一周年纪念日。十一年前的这一天，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，粉碎了资产阶级反动派企图组织反革命政变的阴谋。这个胜利日是捷克斯洛伐克人民一个具有伟大历史意义的日子。
    1945年5月，捷克斯洛伐克人民在苏军的援助下获得解放。1946年5月在战后第一次的国民议会选举中，捷克斯洛伐克共产党已成为最强大的政党，因而组成了以捷共主席哥特瓦尔德为首的民族阵线各政党的联合政府。新政府当时所面临的任务是制订一系列的革命措施，其中包括制订新宪法、拟订第一个恢复和发展国民经济的两年计划（1947—1948年）以及通过新土地改革法草案等许多重要法律。在外交政策方面，新政府也决定进一步加强和巩固与苏联的联盟。但是，资产阶级反动派自从新捷克斯洛伐克诞生的那一天起，就力图从人民手中夺回政权，消灭民主成果，恢复资本主义制度。当时，在政府中占有部长职位的三个资产阶级政党——国家社会党、天主教人民党和斯洛伐克民主党的反动势力，勾结一些旧军官，阴谋制造政治危机，并且还拟订了发起武装暴动的计划。1948年2月20日，反动势力开始行动了。反动党派的十二个部长和两个国务秘书在这一天向当时的总统贝奈斯提出辞职。他们企图通过这一行动迫使在政府中占多数席位的属于共产党和社会民主党的其他部长们辞职，以便在取得贝奈斯总统的完全同意后建立一个所谓事务政府，由这个政府组织即将到来的五月议会选举，以便达到迫使共产党人退出政府的目的。但是，反动派失算了。捷克斯洛伐克人民在共产党的领导下行动起来了。21日，哥特瓦尔德同志在布拉格十万人的群众大会上向全体人民报告了当时的情况，他号召人民团结一致反对资产阶级反动派的阴谋。“让总统接受反动部长的辞职，我们要一个民族阵线的新政府”已成为当时群众一致的口号。全国人民都起来和反动派作斗争。这一天，在捷克斯洛伐克的广大城市和乡村里都开始组织了包括各党派人员在内的行动委员会。工人武装也组织起来了。在人民的强大压力下，贝奈斯不得不接受了全体反动部长的辞职，把他们从政府中清除出去。
    2月25日，由哥特瓦尔德同志提名的新政府正式成立。这一天，哥特瓦尔德同志向布拉格的劳动群众发表的演说中说：“人民的事业胜利了，今天将成为我国新的历史上最光荣的一天。”接着新政府在5月9日通过新宪法。在5月30日的议会选举中，新的民族阵线各政党获得胜利，捷共议员占压倒多数。6月，贝奈斯辞职，哥特瓦尔德同志在全国人民的欢呼声中当选为共和国总统。资产阶级反动派的阴谋被彻底粉碎了。
    1948年2月事件，打开了捷克斯洛伐克人民顺利地进行社会主义建设的新阶段。捷克斯洛伐克人民在捷共的领导下，在发展国民经济方面，已经胜利地完成了恢复和发展国民经济的两年计划（1947—1948年）、第一个五年计划（1949—1953年）和1954、1955两个年度计划。从1956年起，捷克斯洛伐克人民已经开始执行了第二个五年计划。这些计划的胜利执行，已使得捷克斯洛伐克的工业获得迅速的发展而成为一个工业高度发达的国家。如按人口平均计算，它的煤产量目前已占世界第三位；钢的生产已超过了法国和瑞典；在机床生产方面已达到资本主义世界中最发达国家的水平。
    1958年6月，捷共举行了第十一次代表大会。会议响亮地号召全党和全国人民向着社会主义的胜利前进，会议并就进一步大力发展国民经济和提高人民的物质文化生活水平等问题规定了具体的方针和任务。根据会议所提出的指标，规定1965年的工业生产要比1957年增加90％到95％，在农业方面将大约提高一倍，到1965年预计个人消费量要比1957年约提高45％，到1970年时将基本上解决住房问题。这些指标的胜利完成，将使捷克斯洛伐克到1965年按人口计算的产量方面大大超过法国，并将基本上达到西德和美国的经济水平。
    今天，捷克斯洛伐克人民是以在社会主义建设中不断获得新的巨大胜利的标志下来纪念光荣的二月事件十一周年的。十一年来的事实证明，只有在捷共的领导下，捷克斯洛伐克人民才取得了这样伟大的成就。
