    Plagiarism Should Be Opposed
    After reading Chen Ruheng's poem "County Chief Comrade, Please Don't Leave" on the sixth page of the People's Daily on February 16, I found it very familiar. I checked the 24th issue of "Liberation Army Warrior" in 1956 and found a poem called "Regimental Commander, Please Don't Leave," written by Zhang Yongmei. Comparing the two poems, it can be seen that Chen Ruheng's poem is plagiarized, only changing "Regimental Commander" to "County Chief" and adding some irrelevant words. I think this kind of plagiarism is despicable and should be opposed.

    抄袭行为应当反对
    看了人民日报2月16日第六版陈如恒的一首诗“县长同志你不要走”，觉得非常眼熟。查了一下“解放军战士”1956年第二十四期，有一首诗是“大军同志不要走”，张永枚写的。把两诗对照，可以看出陈如恒的诗是抄袭的，只不过将“大军”改成“县长”，另外添了一些无关紧要的字。我觉得这种抄袭行为是可鄙的，应当反对。
