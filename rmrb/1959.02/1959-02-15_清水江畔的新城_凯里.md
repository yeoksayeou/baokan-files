    The New City on the Banks of the Qingshui River—Kaili
    By our reporter Liu Yangshen
    Traveling by bus from Guiyang along the Xiangqian Highway for more than 180 kilometers, and crossing the Qingshui River Bridge, you arrive at Kaili, the capital of the Qian Southeast Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture.
    Kaili is located in the middle reaches of the Qingshui River, on the edge of the Miaoling Mountains. For hundreds of years, it has been the political and economic center connecting the upper and lower reaches, and linking the inside and outside of the mountains. It has been an important land and water terminal in the Qian Southeast region since ancient times. After being selected as the capital of the Autonomous Prefecture in 1956, people of all ethnic groups began to build this new city on the fields next to the market town.
    The Miaoling Mountains stand like a barrier beside it, and the green Qingshui River flows at its feet. On the undulating hills between the mountains and the water, the prototype of a modern city has emerged. The city center is a street garden with a diameter of ninety meters, planted with lush evergreen trees. Around it, tall department stores, restaurants, cinemas, post offices, and other buildings have been built. The leading organs of the Autonomous Prefecture are also near the city center. Many tall buildings have appeared on the Niuchangba, where the Miao people used to release cattle and fight during festivals, and on the Malangpo, where young people used to court each other. In the remote places where only the sounds of insects and birds could be heard in the past, the rhythmic roar of factory machines echoes today.
      Kaili is both a young and an ancient heroic place. In the hundred years before liberation, many peasant uprisings of ethnic minorities in the Qian Southeast region, whether it was the uprising led by the Miao hero Zhang Xiu-mei during the same period as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, or the Qian East Incident in 1943 in which the people opposed the reactionary group of Chiang Kai-shek, occurred in or around Kaili. The "Tomb of Ten Thousand People" in the center of today's Kaili city is where tens of thousands of Miao and other fraternal ethnic groups were killed and buried after the failure of the Miao uprising a century ago. Under a large banyan tree not far from the "Tomb of Ten Thousand People" is where Li Xue-gao, the leader of the Miao uprising at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and his comrades died. The busiest intersection of the Great Cross Street today was the battlefield of repeated contention during the liberation of Kaili. All these heroic and tragic historical sites make the people of all ethnic groups in Kaili cherish and love their happy and beautiful life today even more. Under the leadership of the Party, they are marching more bravely towards the great road of socialism and communism.
    Kaili is not only the political and economic center of the Qian Southeast Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, but also a place for cultivating minority talents. In the cultural and educational area in the east of the city, Kaili Agricultural University, National Middle School, National Normal School, and other schools have been established.
    Kaili had virtually no industry before liberation. Now, in addition to many indigenous furnaces for steelmaking and iron smelting, the construction of the Kaili Iron and Steel Plant with an annual output of 90,000 tons of iron, 50,000 tons of steel, and 40,000 tons of steel材 is underway, and it will partially go into production this year. The blowers, monkey furnaces, indigenous lathes, etc., produced by the Kaili Machinery Factory have played a significant role in the steel and machinery production of the entire prefecture. On the construction site of the nearby hydropower station, more than 5,000 ethnic workers are actively working. People will use the water of the Qingshui River to generate 30,000 kilowatts of electricity to meet the industrial and civilian electricity needs of the Kaili area. Because Qian Southeast is a forest area, in addition to the establishment of a large-scale mechanical lumber mill and cork processing plant near Kaili, the Kaili Paper Mill with an annual output of 30,000 tons of newsprint is also being planned. The builders of Kaili believe that under the wise leadership of the Party, Kaili will soon appear as a modern industrial city on the southwest plateau of the motherland.

    清水江畔的新城——凯里
    本报记者　刘扬深
    从贵阳乘客车沿湘黔公路向东行一百八十多公里，驶过清水江大桥，便到达黔东南苗族侗族自治州首府凯里。
    凯里处在清水江中游，苗岭山区边沿，几百年来就是衔接上游和下游、联系山内和外地的政治经济中心，是黔东南地区自古以来的重要水陆码头。1956年被选定为自治州首府后，各族人民便在集镇旁边的田野上建设着这座新城。
    苗岭群山像屏障一样伫立在它身旁，碧绿的清水江在它脚下奔流。在山和水之间起伏的丘陵地上，出现了现代城市的雏型。城市中心是一个直径九十公尺的街心花园，里面种着葱绿的常青树。在它周围，建起了高大的百货商店、饭店以及电影院、邮电局等，自治州的领导机关也在市中心附近。过去苗族人民在节日放牛打架的牛场坝、年轻人谈情说爱的马郎坡上，出现了很多的高大楼房；原来只能听到虫声鸟语的偏僻地方，今天回荡着工厂机器发出的有节奏的轰鸣。
      凯里是一个既年轻又古老的英雄地方。解放前一百多年间黔东南地区少数民族农民掀起的许多次起义斗争，不论是与太平天国同时期的、由苗族英雄张秀眉领导的起义运动，或是1943年人民反对蒋介石反动集团而暴发的黔东事变，都发生在凯里或它的周围。在今天凯里城市中心的“万人坟”，便是百年前苗家起义失败后，成千上万苗族和其他兄弟民族人民被杀害、埋葬的地方。离“万人坟”不远的一棵大黄桷树下，就是清末苗族起义领袖李学高和他的战友们殉难的地方。今天最热闹的大十字街口，正是解放凯里时反复争夺的战场。这一切英勇悲壮史迹，使凯里各族人民，更加珍惜热爱今天幸福美好的生活。在党领导下更加奋勇地朝着社会主义、共产主义大道迈进。
    凯里不仅是黔东南苗族侗族自治州的政治、经济中心，也是培养少数民族人才的地方。在城市东部的文教区，凯里农业大学、民族中学、民族师范学校等都已建立。
    凯里在解放前根本没有什么工业。现在，除许多土炉炼钢炼铁外，一座年产九万吨铁、五万吨钢、四万吨钢材的凯里钢铁厂正在动工兴建，今年可部分投入生产。凯里机械厂生产的鼓风机、猴子炉、土车床等，对全州的钢铁、机械生产，起了很大作用。附近的水电站工地上，五千多各族民工正在积极施工，人们将使清水江的水发出三万瓩电力，满足凯里地区工业和民用电力的需要。正因为黔东南是一个林区，在凯里附近除建立起规模较大的机械制材厂和软木加工厂外，还正筹建年产三万吨以新闻纸为主的凯里造纸厂。凯里的建设者们相信，在党的英明领导下，凯里很快就将以一个现代化工业城市的面貌，出现在祖国西南的高原上。
