Xinhua News Agency, February 27th: The headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League and its Beijing branch held a symposium tonight to commemorate the 12th anniversary of the "February 28th Uprising" of the Taiwanese people. All speakers vehemently denounced the U.S. plot to create "two Chinas" and occupy Taiwan, and expressed their confident belief that Taiwan must return to the embrace of the motherland.

The symposium was presided over by Xu Mengshan, Secretary-General of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League headquarters. He said that our elders, brothers, and sisters in Taiwan are increasingly eager for liberation and for Taiwan to return to the embrace of the motherland's family, because they are living in a hell on earth under American enslavement and suffering all kinds of hardships from the Americans. We deeply sympathize with and miss our compatriots in Taiwan, and we firmly stand with them to fight to the end to drive out the American aggressors. Xu Mengshan condemned the U.S. plot to create "two Chinas." He said that the United States wants to turn Taiwan into its colony, making the Taiwanese people slaves of the United States forever. However, the Taiwanese people, with their patriotic tradition, will never allow the U.S. to succeed in this plot. Now, the anti-American sentiment of the Taiwanese compatriots is rising daily, and the American aggressors have become their mortal enemies. Xu Mengshan said: The Taiwanese people's patriotic and anti-American struggle is not isolated. They not only have the strong backing of the motherland, but also the support of the people of socialist countries and countries around the world. The motherland's socialist Great Leap Forward and the situation where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind are even more conducive to our liberation of Taiwan.

Xie Nanguang, Yang Chunsong, Tian Fuda, Chen Wenbin, Su Ziheng, Chen Dingmao, Chen Bingji, and others also spoke at the meeting. They all angrily condemned the American aggressors for occupying Taiwan and enslaving the Taiwanese people, and expressed their hope that the military and civilians of Taiwan would unite under the banner of patriotism, resolutely smash the U.S. plot to create "two Chinas," and strive to return to the embrace of the motherland at an early date.

    台湾一定要回到祖国怀抱
    台盟集会纪念“二·二八”十二周年
    一致痛斥美国制造“两个中国”阴谋
    新华社27日讯　台湾民主自治同盟总部和北京市支部，为纪念台湾人民“二·二八起义”十二周年，今天晚上举行座谈会。所有发言的人都痛斥美国制造“两个中国”企图霸占台湾的阴谋，并且充满信心地指出，台湾一定要回到祖国的怀抱。
    座谈会由台湾民主自治同盟总部秘书长徐萌山主持。他说，我们在台湾的父老兄弟姊妹们要求解放和盼望台湾回到祖国大家庭怀抱的心情愈来愈迫切，因为他们在美国的奴役下，还过着人间地狱的生活，吃尽了美国人的苦头。我们十分同情和怀念在台湾的同胞，并且坚决和他们站在一起，为赶走美国侵略者而斗争到底。徐萌山痛斥美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋。他说，美国要把台湾成为它的殖民地，使台湾同胞永远成为美国的奴隶。但是，具有爱国传统的台湾人民绝不容许美国这种阴谋得逞。现在台湾同胞的反美情绪日益高涨，美国侵略者已成了他们的死敌。徐萌山说：台湾人民爱国反美斗争不是孤立的，不但有强大的祖国作后盾，还有社会主义各国和世界各国的人民的支持。目前祖国社会主义的大跃进，全世界东风压倒西风的形势，是更有利于我们解放台湾。
    在会上发言的还有谢南光、杨春松、田富达、陈文彬、苏子蘅、陈丁茂、陈炳基等人，他们一致愤怒谴责美国侵略者霸占台湾和奴役台湾人民，希望台湾军民同胞在爱国主义的旗帜下团结起来，一致对外，坚决粉碎美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋，争取早日回到祖国怀抱。
