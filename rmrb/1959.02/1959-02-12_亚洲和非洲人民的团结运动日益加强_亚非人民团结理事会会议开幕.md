Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 11th: The Asian-African People's Solidarity Council meeting opened here today. The meeting was presided over by Youssef el-Sebai, Secretary-General of the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council. The meeting is scheduled to last for three days.

Anwar Sadat, who served as chairman of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo at the end of 1957, said in his speech at the meeting today that since the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference was held, a lot of work has been done and many events have occurred: many colonies have emerged as independent countries; the nationalist movement has made progress.

He believes that these events have forced imperialism to change its practices. He said that imperialist countries are now disguising themselves as protectors of Asian and African interests. He said, but Asian and African countries cannot be deceived by them. "We know that this is imperialism desperately trying to undermine our movement."

He said that this meeting is being held now because events in Asia and Africa, especially in Africa, need to be studied and considered, new decisions need to be made, and our policies need to be re-evaluated.

Secretary-General of the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, Sebai, gave a work report on the Secretariat of the Council at the meeting. He reviewed the activities carried out by the Secretariat in the past year with the assistance of the Asian-African Solidarity Committees of various countries. He said that imperialism has launched a powerful movement against us. Despite all its means, it cannot affect our unity.

Vice-Chairman of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, Rameshwari Nehru, emphasized the importance of the solidarity of the Asian and African people in her speech. She said that the solidarity of our two continents helped Indonesia defeat the rebellion supported by foreign countries, helped the Iraqi people defend their revolution, and forced the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan. She pointed out that the rise of the African people was the most prominent event of the past year. Thousands of people in Cameroon, Kenya, Congo, Madagascar, Somaliland and other countries are dedicating their lives or entering prisons, which proves their indomitable iron-like determination.

Mrs. Nehru said that the Algerian liberation movement continues to progress as powerfully as before. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria has stood its ground. She said that the sooner de Gaulle recognizes this fait accompli, the better it will be for all parties concerned.

Referring to the situation in Asia, she pointed out that the strength of the people fighting to defend their national freedom, against imperialist interference and aggression, and against military treaties and bases is growing.

She said, "Despite protests from all over the world, the United States is still blatantly violating China's territorial waters. Jinmen and Mazu are still controlled under the shadow of foreign bayonets. The Taiwan issue has not been resolved. The great China with a population of 600 million is still being excluded from the gates of the United Nations."

She continued, Vietnam and Korea remain divided. Foreign troops are still stationed in South Vietnam and South Korea, where foreigners still have ruling power. The current reactionary governments in those regions continue to suppress the people with foreign military assistance. Just a few weeks ago, news came from South Vietnam that more than 1,000 prisoners died under very suspicious circumstances in a concentration camp for political prisoners after eating poisoned food.

She said that military treaties and military bases are expanding, and nuclear weapons are being stored throughout Southeast Asia. Today, some Asian countries are already under military dictatorship. Behind this phenomenon, there is suspicion of hidden foreign interference.

She also said that imperialists are creating new conspiracies in order to continue to maintain their power.

Mrs. Nehru said, therefore, we must strengthen our efforts in all aspects and further strengthen our unity.

She asked, isn't it a fact that the United Nations Organization often fails to support the side of truth and justice? She said that as long as the United Nations excludes the People's Republic of China, and as long as all the committees and agencies of this organization do not have full representation from Asian and African countries, it will never achieve its original goals.

After Mrs. Nehru's speech, the meeting entered a closed session.

### 亚洲和非洲人民的团结运动日益加强  亚非人民团结理事会会议开幕

    亚洲和非洲人民的团结运动日益加强
    亚非人民团结理事会会议开幕
    新华社开罗11日电　亚非人民团结理事会会议今天在这里开幕。会议由亚非人民团结理事会书记处总书记优素福·西巴伊主持。会议预定举行三天。
    曾经担任1957年底在开罗举行的亚非人民团结大会主席的安瓦尔·萨达特今天在会议上讲话时说，自从亚非人民团结大会举行以来，已经作了很多工作和发生了很多事件：许多殖民地以独立的国家的姿态出现了；民族主义运动获得了进展。
    他认为，这些事件迫使帝国主义改变了做法。他说，帝国主义国家现在把自己打扮成亚非利益的保护者。他说，可是亚非国家是不可能受它们的欺骗的。“我们知道，这是帝国主义死命企图破坏我们的运动”。
    他说，现在举行这次会议是因为亚非、尤其是非洲的事件需要研究和考虑，需要作出新的决定和重新估计我们的政策。
    亚非人民团结理事会书记处总书记西巴伊在会上作了关于理事会书记处的工作报告。他回顾了过去一年中，书记处在各国亚非团结委员会协助下所进行的活动。他说，帝国主义发动了反对我们的强有力的运动。尽管它用尽了各种手段，但是并不能影响我们的团结。
    亚非人民团结理事会副主席拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁夫人在讲话中强调了亚非人民团结的重要性。她说，我们两洲的团结帮助印度尼西亚击败了得到外国支持的叛乱，帮助伊拉克人民保卫住他们的革命，并且迫使美英军队从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退。她指出，非洲人民的崛起是去年最突出的事件。喀麦隆、怯尼亚、刚果、马达加斯加、索马里兰和其他国家中数以千计的人正在献出生命或走进监狱，这都证明了他们的不可压服的铁一般坚强的决心。
    尼赫鲁夫人说，阿尔及利亚解放运动继续像先前那样有力地在进展。阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府已经站住了脚跟。她说，戴高乐愈早承认这个既成事实，对所有有关方面来说就愈好。
    她在谈到亚洲局势时指出，为保卫他们的民族自由、反对帝国主义的干涉和侵略、反对军事条约和基地而进行斗争的人民的力量正日益壮大。
    她说，“尽管全世界提出了抗议，但是美国仍然明目张胆地侵犯中国领海。金门和马祖仍然被控制在外国刺刀的阴影之下。台湾问题还没有解决。拥有六亿人口的伟大的中国仍然被排斥在联合国大门外面”。
    她继续说，越南和朝鲜仍然处于分裂状态。在南越和南朝鲜仍然驻有外国军队，在那里外国人仍然有统治的势力。那些地区的目前的反动政府继续在外国军事援助下镇压人民。就在几星期前，从南越传来消息说，在囚禁政治犯的一个集中营中在非常可疑的环境下有一千多名犯人因吃放了毒的食物而死亡。
    她说，军事条约和军事基地正在扩大，并且在整个东南亚储存着核武器。今天一些亚洲国家已经处在军事独裁底下。在这种现象的后面，有着隐蔽的外国干涉的嫌疑。
    她还说，帝国主义者正在制造新的阴谋，以便继续保持他们的权力。
    尼赫鲁夫人说，因此，我们必须在一切方面加强我们的努力，并且进一步加强我们的团结。
    她问道，联合国组织常常不能支持真理和正义的一边，这难道不是一个事实吗？她说，只要联合国排斥中华人民共和国，只要所有这个组织的委员会和机构没有亚非国家的充分代表权，它就永远不能实现它的原来目标。
    尼赫鲁夫人讲话以后，会议进入了秘密会议。
