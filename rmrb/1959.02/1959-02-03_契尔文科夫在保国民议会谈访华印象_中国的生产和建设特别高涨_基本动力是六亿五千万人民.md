Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, February 1st: The Bulgarian National Assembly held its third session today.

    The meeting discussed and approved the orders and resolutions issued by the Presidium of the National Assembly from November 5 last year to January 31 this year, as well as the draft amendment to the election law proposed due to changes in Bulgaria's administrative divisions.

    Chervenkov, member of the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee and Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers, who led a friendly visit to China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Mongolia last autumn, also gave a report at the meeting on the Bulgarian National Assembly delegation's visit to these countries.

    In his report, Chervenkov emphasized that the National Assembly delegation's visit was another manifestation of the ever-increasing friendship and solidarity between the Bulgarian people and the peoples of China, Vietnam, Korea, and Mongolia, as well as the peoples of all countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, in the struggle for peace and socialism.

    Referring to the National Assembly delegation's friendly visit to China, Chervenkov gave the deputies a detailed account of the unprecedented great achievements made by the Chinese people in the movement to establish people's communes and in the nationwide Great Leap Forward movement, especially in steel and grain production.

    He pointed out that the decisive force guaranteeing the achievements of China's national economic development and the Great Leap Forward is the policy implemented by the Chinese Communist Party. This policy has been accepted by the entire Chinese people, thus becoming a huge material force.

    Chervenkov also mentioned that the Chinese Communist Party is a mature Marxist-Leninist party, which consistently implements the mass line in its work. The Party relies on the masses in all aspects and at all times, takes care of the interests of the masses, and maintains close ties with the masses.

    Chervenkov gave a very high evaluation of the Chinese people, saying: "The basic driving force for China's particularly high production and construction is the 650 million Chinese people. They are a great people. No sincere person who has visited China does not deeply respect and sincerely love the Chinese people."

    Chervenkov said, "The great achievements made by the Chinese people are inseparable from the support and assistance of the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union."

    Subsequently, Nikolai Georgiev, a member of the Bulgarian National Assembly delegation and Vice-Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly, and Rada Balevska, a member of the delegation and a member of the Presidium of the National Assembly, also reported at the meeting on their impressions of the visits and praised the brilliant achievements made by these countries in socialist construction.

    The next meeting will be held in the second half of February.

    契尔文科夫在保国民议会谈访华印象
    中国的生产和建设特别高涨  基本动力是六亿五千万人民
    新华社索非亚1日电　保加利亚国民议会今天举行了第三次会议。
    会议讨论并通过了国民议会主席团于去年11月5日到今年1月31日期间所颁布的命令和决议以及由于保加利亚行政区划的变更而提出的选举法修改法案。
    在去秋曾到中国、越南民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和蒙古进行了友好访问的保加利亚国民议会代表团团长、保共中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席契尔文科夫在会上还作了关于保加利亚国民议会代表团访问这些国家的报告。
    契尔文科夫在报告中强调指出，国民议会代表团的访问是保加利亚人民和中国、越南、朝鲜和蒙古各国人民之间以及以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营各国人民之间在争取和平和社会主义斗争中的日益增强的友谊和团结的又一表现。
    谈到国民议会代表团对中国的友好访问时，契尔文科夫向议员们详细地介绍了中国人民在建立人民公社运动和在全民大跃进运动中，特别是在钢和粮食生产方面取得的前所未有的巨大成就。
    他指出，保证中国国民经济发展和跃进取得成就的决定性力量是中国共产党执行的政策。这一政策已为全中国人民所接受，从而变成了巨大的物质力量。
    契尔文科夫还谈到中国共产党是成熟的马克思列宁主义政党，它在自己的工作中一贯执行群众路线。党在各个方面随时随地依靠群众，照顾群众利益，同群众打成一片。
    契尔文科夫对中国人民给予极高的评价，他说：“中国生产和建设特别高涨的基本动力是六亿五千万中国人民。他们是伟大的人民。没有一个访问过中国的诚挚的人不深深尊敬和真诚爱戴中国人民。”
    契尔文科夫说，“中国人民取得的巨大成就是与苏联以及以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的支持和帮助分不开的。”
    接着，保加利亚国民议会代表团团员、议会主席团副主席尼古拉·格奥尔吉耶夫，代表团团员、国民议会主席团委员拉达·巴列夫斯卡也在会上报告了他们在访问中的印象和赞扬这些国家在社会主义建设方面取得的辉煌成就。
    下次会议将于2月下半月举行。
