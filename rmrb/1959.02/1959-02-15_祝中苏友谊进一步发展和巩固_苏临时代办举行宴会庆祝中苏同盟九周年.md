Xinhua News Agency, February 14th. Soviet Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to China, Antonov, held a banquet tonight to warmly celebrate the 9th anniversary of the signing of the Sino–Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.

Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi was invited to attend the banquet. In a joyful speech, he said that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is a manifestation of the sincere cooperation between the two great peoples and the two great nations. This great treaty is a pillar of world peace and will bring lasting happiness to the people of the world.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that this great treaty is the most exemplary model of state relations in the modern world that conforms to the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and it is also a testament to the great assistance of the Soviet Union to China. The Chinese people deeply thank the Soviet Union for its help to our country.

Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has a far-reaching influence and great historical significance. Today, wherever national democratic revolutions occur and new countries emerge in the world, they receive the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Over the past nine years, the Soviet Union has made brilliant achievements in its construction. The recent 21st Congress of the CPSU put forward a seven-year plan for communist construction. The economies of socialist countries have developed rapidly, while the life of imperialism is not long. Today, when we see that the Soviet Union has completed socialist construction and entered the era of all-round communist construction, our joy is indescribable.

Vice Premier Chen Yi concluded by saying that today, on the one hand, we see the disasters that imperialism has inflicted on the people of the world, and on the other hand, we see the great socialist construction and the transition from socialism to communism. Comparing the two, we can see the bright future of mankind. We are most fortunate to live in this era, and we are full of confidence and joy. Vice Premier Chen Yi proposed a toast to this.

Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Antonov spoke at the beginning of the banquet. He said that the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed on February 14, 1950, is a vivid embodiment of the spiritual and labor unity of our two countries. This treaty is a permanently effective document that plays an increasingly important role in ensuring the peace and security of our two peoples.

Antonov said that we celebrate this meaningful anniversary with increasing joy year by year. Our friendship has increased, and this friendship is becoming more and more meaningful and effective. The world situation is becoming more and more fundamentally favorable to us, and the days of the final collapse of capitalism are getting closer and closer. The complete victory of our cause is becoming more and more obvious. Sino-Soviet friendship, in the past, present and future, is the decisive factor for the entire socialist camp to win the peaceful competition against capitalism. There is no force in the world that can shake our friendship.

Antonov concluded by saying that the 21st Congress of the CPSU has opened up an era of comprehensive communist social construction. The seven-year plan is designed to comprehensively develop the country's productive forces, and on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, to achieve such an increase in the production of all economic sectors as to ensure that a decisive step is taken in establishing the material and technical foundation of communism.

Also present at tonight's banquet were Bao Erhan, Shen Yanbing, Zhang Xiruo, Shi Liang, Li Dequan, Qian Junrui, Zeng Yongquan, Deng Tuo and other responsible persons from various fields. During the banquet, the hosts and guests repeatedly raised their glasses to congratulate the further development and consolidation of the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

    祝中苏友谊进一步发展和巩固
    苏临时代办举行宴会庆祝中苏同盟九周年
    新华社14日讯　苏联驻中国临时代办安东诺夫今晚举行宴会，热烈庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订九周年。
    陈毅副总理兼外交部长应邀出席了宴会。他在欢乐的宴会上讲话说，中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订是两国伟大人民真诚合作的表现，是两个伟大国家真诚合作的表现。这个伟大的条约是世界和平的支柱，它将为世界人民带来永久的幸福。
    陈毅副总理说，这个伟大的条约是现代世界国家关系中最符合平等互利原则的典范，它又是苏联对中国伟大援助的证明，中国人民深切感谢苏联对我国的帮助。
    陈毅副总理指出，中苏友好同盟互助条约有深远的影响和巨大的历史意义。今天世界上任何地方发生民族民主革命和产生新的国家，都得到以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的支持。九年来，苏联在建设中取得了光辉的成就，最近苏共第二十一次代表大会又提出了进行共产主义建设的七年计划，社会主义各国的经济都有飞跃发展，而帝国主义的寿命却不长了。今天，当我们看到苏联完成了社会主义建设进入全面建设共产主义的时代，我们快乐的心情是难以用言语形容的。
    陈毅副总理最后说，今天，我们一方面看到了帝国主义加在世界人民头上的灾难，另一方面我们又看到了伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义向共产主义建设过渡，两者一比较就看出了人类光明的前途，我们生活在这个时代是最幸福的，我们充满了信心和喜悦。陈毅副总理提议为此而干杯。
    安东诺夫临时代办在宴会开始的时候讲话。他说，1950年2月14日所签订的友好同盟互助条约，是我们两国精神上和劳动上团结一致的生动体现。这个条约是在保障我们两国人民的和平和安全方面起着越来越大的作用的永久有效的文件。
    安东诺夫说，我们庆祝这个有意义的纪念日，情况是一年比一年高兴。我们的友谊增进起来了，这种友谊越来越富有意义，富有效果。世界局势越来越从根本上对我们有利，资本主义的最后瓦解日子越来越近。我们事业的完全胜利越来越明显。苏中友谊在过去、现在和将来都是整个社会主义阵营对资本主义在和平竞赛中获得胜利的决定性因素。世界上没有能够动摇我们友谊的力量。
    安东诺夫最后说，苏共二十一次代表大会开辟了全面展开的共产主义社会建设的时代。七年计划中拟定全面发展国家的生产力，在优先发展重工业的基础上，使一切经济部门的生产获得这样的增长，以保证在建立共产主义的物质技术基础方面迈出决定性的一步。
    出席今晚宴会的，还有各方面的负责人包尔汉、沈雁冰、张奚若、史良、李德全、钱俊瑞、曾涌泉、邓拓等。席间，宾主一再举杯祝贺中苏两国伟大友谊进一步发展和巩固。（附图片）
