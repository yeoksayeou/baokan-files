    Fish's "Sleep"

    Professor Viener has made some interesting discoveries about the sleeping habits of fish: most fish are very alert, and even the slightest undetectable vibration in the water above or below will wake them up. Some fish sleep in comical positions, and some change color while sleeping.

    Generally, blackfish sleep on their sides, half-buried in gravel or pebbles, bending their bodies into strange shapes, just like people sleeping. Pufferfish bend their bodies at a certain angle when sleeping, using the grass or stones in the pond as a backrest. During the day, their color is brown and dark green, but when sleeping, they turn light gray, and their fins and tail turn black. Because pufferfish usually sleep in rocks or aquatic plants, their sleeping posture and color changes can protect themselves.

    Red sea bream and thorny sea bream are silver during the day, but turn dark bronze when sleeping. If you shine a flashlight in the fish pond, the red sea bream will wake up immediately and return to its silver color. Red sea bream usually sleep in seaweed, using color changes to camouflage themselves.

    The "cuttlefish" does not have a fixed sleeping posture. Sometimes it sleeps diagonally, sometimes with its tail pointing down, and sometimes with its tentacles pointing down, curled up into a ball. The head is extended forward, and the upper body is slightly raised for breathing. At this time, its water inlet pipe is turned to one side. In this case, its color is darker, and the spots on its body are more obvious. This is due to the expansion of brown-purple pigment cells.

### 鱼的“睡眠”

    鱼的“睡眠”
    维内尔教授对鱼的睡眠习惯有了一些有趣的发现：大多数的鱼都非常警觉，水上或水中的任何一点几乎觉察不到的震动都会把它弄醒。有的鱼睡觉的姿势很滑稽，有的鱼睡觉时颜色会变。
    一般黑鱼是侧着身子睡的，半身埋在砂砾或石子中，像人睡觉一样，把身躯弯成一种奇怪的样子。鲀睡觉时身躯弯成一定角度，用池中的草或石头作靠背，白天，它的颜色是褐色和深绿色，但睡眠时却变为浅灰色，鳍和尾变为黑色。因为鲀通常在岩石或水草中睡眠，所以它的睡眠姿势和颜色变化可以保护自己。
    赤鲷和棘鬣鱼白天是银光色，睡眠时却变为暗铜色。如果用手电在鱼池中一闪，赤鲷就会立即醒来，并恢复银光色。赤鲷通常睡在海草中，用颜色变化来掩护自己。
    “乌贼”睡眠的姿势不固定，有时斜着睡，有时尾尖朝下，有时则触手朝下，并缩成一团。头部前伸，上体略抬起以便呼吸，这时，它的进水管是转向一边的。在这种情况下，它的颜色更暗，身上的斑点也更为明显。这是由于褐
    紫色的色素细胞扩张所致。（原载“创造与发明”报）
