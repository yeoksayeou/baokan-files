To adapt to the new situation of a greater leap forward in production this year, the Hanjiawa People's Commune in Ding County, Hebei Province, is further developing adult education to train more people to become skilled in production technology innovation and tool improvement.

In the past few years, the Hanjiawa People's Commune, through the literacy campaign, especially the march towards culture, science, and technology last year, has eliminated illiteracy for more than 18,500 people, enabling 88.5% of the illiterate to open their eyes, fundamentally changing the commune's original backward cultural outlook. Although these literacy graduates have shed their illiteracy, their cultural level is not yet high, and their scientific and technological knowledge is not rich, especially under the current situation of a greater leap forward in production, which is not yet adapted to the requirements of production technology innovation and tool improvement. Therefore, they demand further study of culture and technology. There are also more than 1,400 illiterate people in the commune, and more than 900 people who have lost their literacy and relapsed into illiteracy also demand to completely eliminate illiteracy and further catch up with the needs of the production situation. Under the leadership of the commune's Party committee, since the beginning of winter, the commune has decided to thoroughly eliminate literacy, cultural illiteracy, and scientific and technological illiteracy, and develop spare-time education for workers and peasants, making it regular, and gradually consolidating and improving, under the principle of not affecting production, combining with production, and serving production. Currently, more than 15,600 people in the commune are participating in learning, including more than 2,300 in literacy classes, more than 11,500 in spare-time senior primary school classes, and more than 1,600 in spare-time junior middle school classes (excluding those participating in water reservoir construction site studies and others). Through this stage of learning, more than 1,500 literacy class students have learned more than 1,000 characters, and more than 500 have learned more than 500 characters. Students studying in spare-time senior primary school and spare-time junior middle school classes have also made varying degrees of improvement, further mastering cultural and scientific and technological knowledge, and playing a greater role in production.

In carrying out adult education, the Hanjiawa People's Commune has emphasized the importance of the Party committee, with the secretary taking the lead and putting politics in command. After making achievements in the large-scale literacy campaign last year, some cadres developed a slack mood and did not actively organize the masses to study culture, politics, and technology. Political and ideological education was not deeply and thoroughly implemented, and production, learning, and work were slow. After learning about this situation, the commune's Party committee immediately included spare-time education for workers and peasants on the Party committee's agenda, conducted regular research, and communicated ideas at all levels, pointing out the important significance of learning culture for improving production, requiring cadres at all levels to manage this work, and summarizing the achievements of past learning and production, continuing to encourage efforts, and organizing a 10,000-person propaganda army to conduct in-depth mobilization. The commune's Party committee established a cultural and technical spare-time school, with the first secretary serving as the principal. All twelve production brigades, six industrial units, and three production and construction units in the commune established a total of twenty-one cultural and technical spare-time school branches, with the first secretary or factory director serving as the branch principal. Learning stations were established in each village, with the branch secretary or production company commander serving as the station chief. Unified leadership, unified arrangement of production and learning time, organization of the masses to study or solve specific problems, with someone in charge at each level, and someone managing at each level, established a spare-time education network for workers and peasants. Party secretaries at all levels not only managed production and learning, and provided comprehensive leadership, but also took the lead in participating in learning. For example, commune cadres studied for two hours every morning, never delaying their studies or being absent without reason.

In running adult education, the Hanjiawa People's Commune fully relied on the masses, mobilized the masses, and followed the mass line. The commune's Party committee grasped backbones at all levels, conducted training at all levels, mobilized all positive factors, and achieved ten thousand people teaching and the whole people learning, with the able serving as teachers. Under the premise of not affecting production, the commune transferred 125 backbone civilian teachers and trained them in two phases, focusing on learning Chinese phonetic alphabet, so that the illiterate could quickly master the written language tool. The study time was every day after the members finished work, from 5:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., with primary school teachers invited to give concentrated lectures. The civilian teachers continued to produce as usual during the day, and during rest time, they practiced on the one hand, taught others on the other, and consolidated themselves, truly achieving learning, teaching, and consolidation at the same time. Each of the 125 backbone civilian teachers trained another six or seven people. In this way, grasping backbones at all levels, conducting training at all levels, one teaching ten, and ten teaching a hundred, made learning a mass movement. Currently, more than 2,000 people in the commune have learned the Chinese phonetic alphabet. The commune also instructed primary school teachers to serve as learning advisors, helping to come up with ideas, make plans, and improve teaching. The commune also organized more than 6,800 students in the third and fourth grades and above of primary schools and students of cultural and technical spare-time schools to provide door-to-door tutoring.

In running adult education, the Hanjiawa People's Commune closely combined production and learning, adopted flexible and diverse organizational forms, and focused on promoting production. The organizational forms of learning and the arrangement of learning time were closely centered on production. All cadres who led production managed both production and learning, regarding learning as one of their own businesses, making unified arrangements for production and learning. As long as they organized and arranged learning according to the needs of production and the demands of the masses, learning would definitely be consolidated. The commune arranged learning, whether centralized or decentralized, and adopted the method of "unified red, specialized in subjects, cultural learning in separate classes." For example, factory workers studied technology every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, culture every Tuesday and Thursday, and politics every Saturday. When attending politics class, everyone gathered together for "unified red." When attending technical class, they studied by subject according to the type of technology (such as electricians, fitters, and lathe operators as one subject, carpenters and cage makers as one subject), achieving "specialized in subjects." According to the different cultural levels of the workers, they were divided into junior middle school, senior primary school, and literacy classes, and when attending cultural classes, "cultural learning was in separate classes." In terms of farmers' learning, this principle was also flexibly applied. In this way, through different forms of learning, closely combined with production, the commune completely organized the young and middle-aged people into learning.

Currently, the Hanjiawa People's Commune is establishing a learning system, grasping ideology, grasping backbones, unifying leadership, unifying arrangements for production and learning, and unifying deployments. The commune is also flexibly applying organizational forms according to the conditions of the students, flexibly applying learning time according to the intensity of production, flexibly arranging teaching content according to the production season, and flexibly arranging learning locations according to changes in work. They paid special attention to the situation of frequent personnel mobility in large-scale production cooperation, timely adjusted organizations, matched teachers, and strengthened leadership, so that adult education could be consolidated and improved, and more people could be trained to become skilled in production technology innovation and tool improvement, adapting to the new situation of a greater leap forward in production this year.

    适应跃进形势  发展成人教育
    韩家洼公社组织社员学习政治文化技术
    本报讯　为了适应今年生产更大的跃进的新形势，河北省定县韩家洼人民公社，进一步发展成人教育，培养更多的人成为生产技术革新和生产工具改良的能手。
    韩家洼人民公社过去几年来，经过扫盲运动，特别是去年向文化科学技术进军，共扫除了文盲一万八千五百多人，使88.5％的文盲睁开了眼睛，基本上改变了公社原来文化落后的面貌。这些扫盲毕业的学员，虽然摘掉了文盲帽子，但是，文化水平还不高，科学技术知识也不丰富，特别是在当前生产更大跃进的形势下，同生产技术革新和生产工具改良的要求还不相适应。所以，他们要求进一步学习文化技术。全社还有一千四百多个文盲，已经摘掉文盲帽子又回生复盲的九百多人，也都要求彻底扫除文盲，进一步赶上生产形势的需要。在公社党委的领导下，入冬以来，全社在不影响生产，结合生产，为生产服务的原则下，决定彻底扫识字盲，扫文化盲，扫科学技术盲，发展工农业余教育，做到经常化，逐步巩固提高。现在全社参加学习的共有一万五千六百多人，其中扫盲班二千三百多人，业余高小班一万一千五百多人，业余初中班一千六百多人（出外参加水库工地学习的和其它不计在内）。通过这一阶段的学习，扫盲班学员已有一千五百多人识字一千以上，五百多人识字五百以上，在业余高小和业余初中班学习的学员，也都有了不同程度的提高，进一步掌握文化和科学技术知识，在生产中发挥更多的作用。
    韩家洼人民公社在开展成人教育中，党委重视，书记出马，政治挂帅。去年大搞扫盲运动，做出了成绩后，有些干部产生了松劲情绪，不积极组织群众学习文化、政治、技术，政治思想教育贯彻不深不透，生产、学习、工作都很迟缓。公社党委了解到这种情况，即把工农业余教育列入党委议事日程，定期研究，层层疏通思想，指出学习文化对提高生产的重要意义，要求各级干部必须管这个工作，并且总结了以往学习和生产的成绩，继续鼓干劲，组织万人宣传大军，深入动员。公社党委办了一所文化技术业余学校，由第一书记任校长。全公社十二个生产大队，六个工业单位，三个生产建设单位，共办了二十一所文化技术业余学校分校，由第一书记或厂长任分校校长。各村建立学习站，由分支书或生产连长任站长。统一领导，统一安排生产和学习时间，组织群众学习或解决具体问题，层层有人抓，层层有人管，建立了工农业余教育网。各级书记不仅管生产，抓学习，全面领导，并且都带头参加学习。如公社干部每天早上学习两小时，从不耽误学习和无故旷课。
    韩家洼人民公社在办成人教育中，充分依靠群众、发动群众、走好群众路线。公社党委层层抓骨干，层层搞训练，调动一切积极因素，做到了万人教、全民学，能者为师。在不影响生产的前提下，公社抽调了一百二十五名骨干民师，分两期进行训练，以学习汉语拼音为主，以便使文盲迅速掌握文字工具。学习时间是每天社员下工以后，下午五点学习到八点半，由聘请来的小学教师集中授课。民师白天照常生产，休息时间一面练习，一面教别人，一面又巩固了自己，真正做到了边学边教边巩固。一百二十五名骨干民师，每人又训练了六、七个人。这样层层抓骨干，层层搞训练，一教十，十教百，使学习形成了群众性的运动。现在全公社已经学会汉语拼音字母的有二千多人。公社还责成各小学教师当学习参谋，帮助出主意，做计划，改进教学。公社并且组织三、四年级以上的小学生和文化技术业余学校的学生共六千八百多人，进行包教，送字上门。
    韩家洼人民公社在办成人教育中，做到生产学习密切结合，组织形式灵活多样，学习内容以推动生产为中心。学习组织形式和学习时间安排紧密围绕生产。凡是领导生产的干部，既管生产，也管学习，把学习当作自己的业务之一，使生产学习统筹安排。只要根据生产的需要和群众的要求，去组织安排他们学习，学习一定能巩固。公社安排学习，不论集中的和分散的，都采取了“统一红，分科专，文化学习分开班”的办法。如工厂工人每星期一、三、五学习技术，星期二、四学习文化，星期六学习政治。上政治课的时候，大家都集中在一起“统一红”。上技术课的时候，按照技术种类分科学习（如电工、钳工、镟工为一科，木工、做笼工人为一科），做到“分科专”。按照工人文化程度的不同，编成初中、高小、扫盲三班，上文化课时，“文化学习分开班”。在农民学习方面，也按照这个原则，灵活处理。这样一来，通过不同的学习形式，密切结合生产，就把公社的青壮年完全组织到学习中来。
    目前，韩家洼人民公社正在通过建立学习制度，抓思想，抓骨干，统一领导，统一安排生产和学习，统一布置。公社并且根据学员条件灵活运用组织形式，根据生产强度灵活运用学习时间，根据生产季节灵活安排教材内容，根据工活变更灵活安排学习地点。他们特别注意在生产大协作中，人员经常流动的情况，及时调整组织，搭配教师，加强领导，使成人教育能够得到巩固和提高，培养更多的人成为生产技术革新和生产工具改良的能手，适应今年生产的更大跃进的新形势。
