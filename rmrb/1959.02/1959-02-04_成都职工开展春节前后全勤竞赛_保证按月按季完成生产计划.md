　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 3rd. Chengdu's broad masses of workers are launching a full attendance competition before and after the Spring Festival to ensure the completion of production and construction plans for February and the first quarter. In recent days, workers from many units, such as the Chengdu Mining Machinery Factory, Zhonghua Paper Mill, the First Mechanized Brick and Tile Factory, the Wangjiaxiang Warehouse of the Municipal Grain Bureau, and the Transit Station of the Supply and Marketing Department of the Municipal Bureau of Heavy Industry, have been swept up in a wave of competition.

　　Many workers whose homes are elsewhere have given up their plans to return home and are preparing to stay in the factory and celebrate the Spring Festival with everyone, so that they can immediately throw themselves into battle as soon as the Spring Festival holiday is over. Some workers who are returning home have also said that they will definitely return to the factory before the end of the holiday. The challenge conditions put forward by the workers of the Chengdu Mining Machinery Factory and other units not only guarantee full attendance before and after the Spring Festival, but also guarantee the completion of production tasks by the tenth of each month before and after the Spring Festival. Some factories have launched a high-yield week movement since February 1st. In the competition, many workers also proposed to have a thrifty festival. Workers returning to the countryside are prepared to participate in some rural labor as much as possible and introduce the factory's leap forward situation to the farmers.
