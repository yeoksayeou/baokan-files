Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The annual Beijing Spring Festival Ring Road Race was held in Beijing today. Wan Lübo, the famous long-distance runner of the People's Liberation Army, after a fierce competition with Dong Yaolu, a student from the Beijing Mining College who came from a mining background, was the first to complete the approximately 13,300-meter race with a time of forty-two minutes and one second. His result exceeded the record of forty-three minutes and four and four-tenths seconds set by Dong Yaolu when he won the race in 1958.

　　Among the 1,353 athletes who participated in the competition today, Dong Yaolu, who has twelve years of work experience, was the second to reach the finish line. His result has also improved compared to last year, reaching forty-two minutes and nine and two-tenths seconds. Dong Yaolu won second place in the competition in 1956 and 1957. He surpassed Wan Lübo twice during the race today, but due to his slightly weaker "sprint" strength at the end, he finished several dozen meters behind Wan Lübo at the finish line.

　　The athletes from Beijing Mining College won a total of three places among the top six athletes today. In addition to Dong Yaolu, Cui Yunhai, a 22-year-old turner from the Mining Machinery Plant of this college (19th place last year), won third place with a time of forty-two minutes and forty-three seconds; Li Jinyao, a 23-year-old teaching assistant from the Coal Mining Department (first place in 1957), won sixth place with a time of forty-three minutes and seventeen and six-tenths seconds.

　　The fourth and fifth places in today's competition were won by Zheng Ketai, a student from the Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration (forty-three minutes and six and two-tenths seconds), and Shi Yongchang, a student from Tsinghua University (forty-three minutes and six and four-tenths seconds).

　　Today's race started and ended in front of Tiananmen Square. As the mighty long-distance running team advanced rapidly along the designated route, it attracted many spectators along the way. Some enthusiastic spectators also watched the race on bicycles.

　　The Beijing Spring Festival Ring Road Race is jointly organized by some news organizations in Beijing. Since the first competition was held in 1956, it has been held every year on the third day of the first lunar month. Zhang Wei, the first place winner in the first competition, had a time of forty-six minutes and thirty-four and six-tenths seconds; the second competition was affected by snow, and the time it took for Li Jinyao, the first place winner, to complete the race was forty-six minutes and fifty-six and eight-tenths seconds. The results of this competition have been further improved last year and this year.

    北京举行春节环城赛跑
    万吕柏以四十二分一秒的成绩获得第一名
    新华社10日讯　一年一度的北京市春节环城赛跑，今天在北京举行。著名的解放军长跑选手万吕柏在同北京矿业学院矿工出身的学生董耀禄经过激烈的竞赛以后，以四十二分一秒的成绩第一个跑完约一万三千三百公尺的全程。他的成绩超过董耀禄1958年这项比赛冠军时创造的四十三分四秒四的纪录。
    在今天参加比赛的一千三百五十三名运动员当中，有十二年工龄的董耀禄是第二个到达终点的。他的成绩也比去年有了提高，达到了四十二分九秒二。董耀禄1956年和1957年都曾经获得这项比赛的第二名。他今天在比赛途中曾两次超过万吕柏，但是由于他最后的“冲刺”力稍差，结果到终点时落后于万吕柏几十公尺。
    北京矿业学院的选手在今天获得前六名的运动员当中，共获得了三个名次，除董耀禄外，还有这个学院矿山机械厂二十二岁的车工崔云海（去年的第十九名）以四十二分四十三秒的成绩获得了第三名；二十三岁的采煤系助教李进尧（1957年的第一名）以四十三分十七秒六的成绩获得了第六名。
    在今天的比赛中获得第四和第五名的是：北京地质勘探学院学生郑可邰（四十三分六秒二）和清华大学学生施永长（四十三分六秒四）。
    今天比赛的起终点都设在天安门前。当这支浩浩荡荡的长跑队伍按指定的路线快速前进的时候，沿途吸引了许多观众。一些热心的观众还骑着脚踏车观看比赛。
    北京市春节环城赛跑是由北京一些新闻单位联合举办的。自从1956年举行了第一届比赛以后，每年都在农历正月初三这天举行。第一届第一名张威的成绩是四十六分三十四秒六；第二届因下雪，成绩受到了影响，第一名李进尧跑完全程用的时间是四十六分五十六秒八。去年和今年，这项比赛的成绩又都有了进一步的提高。
