Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: The People's Liberation Army's campaign to support the government and cherish the people has reached a climax in the past few days. From Changbai Mountain to Hainan Island, from the coast of the East China Sea to the Kangzang Plateau, tens of thousands of officers and soldiers are, every day, working and celebrating with the people in rural communes, city streets, and construction sites, and "doing a good deed for the people's commune."

In Shanghai, more than nine thousand officers and soldiers have gone to reservoir construction sites to develop water conservancy for the people's communes in the suburbs. They said, "We must use every bit of time to contribute to this year's bumper harvest." The troops stationed in Haikou, Guangdong, recently sent a large number of people to help local people's communes build small power stations. In the Beijing area, the troops have launched a high tide of fertilizer accumulation in the past two days. More than 500 officers and soldiers of a certain unit fought for four hours and accumulated more than 300,000 catties of fertilizer. The medical staff of a certain hospital also rushed to accumulate more than one million catties of fertilizer in five days. The fertilizer accumulation movement in the Shenyang, Jinan, and Kunming areas is in full swing. Five units in Jinan, Qingdao, and other places have recently accumulated and produced more than four million catties of fertilizer. At the same time, a large number of troops are also helping with the work of the people's commune canteens, nurseries, and clubs.

In the past two days, a large number of propaganda floats of the troops have also been dispatched, and officers and soldiers enthusiastically publicized the great achievements of China's socialist construction and this year's glorious tasks to the people. Since the 4th, the Shenyang garrison has had more than 60 propaganda vehicles and thousands of officers and soldiers carrying out propaganda to the masses every day. A propaganda team of more than 600 people from a certain military school also carried brooms and shovels, helping the masses clean the streets, carry water, and accumulate fertilizer while carrying out propaganda. The programs performed by the propaganda team are also very popular among the masses. The "Communism is Paradise, the People's Commune is the Bridge" and "New Year's Dance" performed by a certain unit were warmly praised by the masses. Recently, the troops in the Jinan area sent more than 3,900 cadres to help the people's communes with their work and to publicize the spirit of the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party to the members of the communes.

The troops also helped relevant departments in various places to do a good job in the Spring Festival service. The troops stationed in Shanghai recently sent more than 200 officers and soldiers to assist the employees of Shanghai Railway Station in serving passengers. In the past few days, regardless of wind and rain, they have been patiently answering questions, guiding routes, holding children, and carrying luggage for passengers at the station day and night, which has been very thoughtful and has been praised by passengers. The naval forces dispatched ships to assist local shipping departments in transporting passengers. The motor vehicle company of a certain unit of the troops in the Beijing area helped the Xuanhua Wholesale Department of the Zhangjiakou Vegetable Company transport more than 800 tons of materials in 20 days. The railway station management department of the Railway Soldiers on the Nanping-Fuzhou Railway line increased the number of trains from January 28th to carry employees and citizens who were returning home for the Spring Festival.

Under the slogan of "Everyone does a good deed for the people's commune," the troops on the Fujian front specially sent cooks with cooking skills to help the commune make New Year's Eve dinner. Some troops gave gifts to the people's commune. The soldiers of a certain artillery company also used artillery shell boxes to make small stools and gave them to the children of the commune's nursery. A certain unit of the troops in the Beijing area also repainted its bathhouse and invited the local people to take a bath from February 1st to 15th. They also opened a mass recreation room and invited the commune members to come and have fun. Some troops also made a batch of honorary plaques, big red flowers, and Spring Festival couplets and sent them to the martyrs' families and military families of the people's communes.
