    Future Good Doctors
    Fifth-year students of the Department of Medicine at Beijing Medical College, while engaging in labor and production internships in factories and rural areas, also carried out medical and prevention work, thus achieving a double harvest in ideology and work. The situations introduced in this column are some snippets of their medical and prevention work.

    Dongyi Village Has a Health Worker
    Not long ago, Gao Yingxiang and Wang Shangde, students of Beijing Medical College, received a letter from Dongyi Village, Shahe, Changping District, Beijing. The letter asked: What is the relationship between a child's age and weight and medication? It also asked: Do children aged five to seven still need to be vaccinated against pertussis?
    The letter was written by Yang Yongquan, the health worker of Dongyi Village. More than a month ago, when Gao Yingxiang and his classmates were interning in Dongyi Village, Yang Yongquan was their apprentice. Now, this young man with only elementary school education, with the help of the students, can independently take charge of the village's health care work in a short period of time.
    In November last year, when Gao Yingxiang and Wang Shangde, students of Beijing Medical College, came to Dongyi Village for production internships, they helped the village establish a health station, and they also decided to train rural health workers.
    They formulated a training plan and compiled lectures. At the beginning, they planned to teach Yang Yongquan about preventive injections, first aid, bandaging, etc., but the effect was not good; later, they used the method of apprenticing to train Yang Yongquan. Every day, Yang Yongquan followed them to see patients, give injections, bandage wounds, and dispense medicine. They lectured while they worked. When seeing a patient, they would explain the characteristics and treatment methods of the disease, and when dispensing medicine, they would tell him the properties of the medicine. On the way to house calls and in every interval of treating the disease, they patiently and meticulously told Yang Yongquan what they had seen in combination with the diseases. In the evening, they would summarize the day with Yang Yongquan, combining it with general medical theoretical knowledge. Gradually, Yang Yongquan mastered the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of more than 30 common diseases, mastered the properties and usage of more than 70 kinds of medicines, and also mastered techniques such as changing dressings, bandaging, artificial respiration, injections, acupuncture, and massage. From then on, Dongyi Village had its own health worker.
    Now, the students of Beijing Medical College have left Dongyi Village. When Yang Yongquan encounters problems in his work, he still writes to them for inquiries, affectionately calling them "teachers," and the questions he raises will receive satisfactory answers.

    Xiao Huixia Escaped Danger
    The incident occurred in Luzhuang Village, Changping District. Shao Huixia, a nine-month-old girl, contracted measles. Xiao Huixia's father and mother, as well as the local doctor, thought there was no hope. The students of Beijing Medical College who were interning here were determined to do their best to rescue Xiao Huixia.
    The students used drugs and injections for treatment, and Xiao Huixia's condition gradually improved. However, the child's cornea had a white membrane and was severely deficient in vitamins A and D. If this continued, there was a risk of blindness. They continuously injected the child with three injections of vitamins A and D, but the effect was very slow. What to do? If vitamins A and D were dripped into the eyes, the effect would be greater, but what concentration should be used for direct dripping? Would it be irritating? They didn't know. In order not to cause adverse consequences for the child, Communist Party member Gao Yingxiang first used his own eyes to experiment.
    After six days of treatment, Xiao Huixia escaped danger. Xiao Huixia's father is a cadre of the production team, and the production team specially wrote a letter of thanks to the students. The commune members said: They have never seen such doctors. It is really the good teaching of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    Look, How Much They Care for the Children
    One day, the students of Beijing Medical College who were doing labor and production internships at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company finished reading the newspaper to the workers and talked about how to prevent colds, and then they chatted. When the students learned that worker Lao Zhang's child had a severe cough, they were very concerned and, based on the symptoms, tentatively diagnosed it as pertussis. When the students were doing labor internships in the countryside, they used pig gallbladders to treat pertussis very effectively. But now there is no such medicine here, and Lao Zhang and the students are very anxious. So, the students quickly wrote a letter asking their classmates in the countryside to send it. They also inquired everywhere about where there were slaughterhouses, preparing to make this medicine themselves.
    After getting off work at four o'clock, some students rushed to contact outside, and two other female students went to the workers' family dormitories to visit the child. The child was indeed suffering from pertussis. They also went to other workers' homes to see if there were any children who had been infected with pertussis.
    After being busy for a while, it was late at night, and there was still no clue about the medicine, and everyone was very anxious. After a while, a classmate ran in excitedly to tell everyone that he had contacted a certain medical unit by telephone and they had this medicine. The students were so happy that they jumped up and immediately sent someone to notify Lao Zhang.
    When he went to work on the third day, Lao Zhang smiled and said to everyone he met: "My child's cough is much better." He took the students' hands and said:
   "You work with us and help us solve difficulties. You are really future good doctors." (Attached picture)

专栏：

    未来的好大夫
    北京医学院医疗系五年级的学生，到工厂和农村进行劳动和生产实习时，还开展了医疗防治工作，从而获得了思想、工作双丰收。这个专栏里介绍的情况，是他们开展医疗防治工作的一些片断。

    东一村有了保健员
    不久前，北京医学院学生高映祥、王尚德收到从北京昌平区沙河东一村寄来的一封信。信中问：儿童的年龄和体重对用药有什么关系？还问：五岁到七岁的孩子还需不需要注射百日咳疫苗？
    这封信是东一村的保健员杨永泉写来的。一个多月前，高映祥他们在东一村实习时，杨永泉是他们带的徒弟。现在，这个只有小学文化水平的青年经过学生们的帮助，在短期内就能独立担负这个村的保健医疗工作了。
    去年11月间，北京医学院学生高映祥、王尚德来到东一村生产实习时，帮助这个村建立了保健站，他们还决心培养农村保健员。
    他们订了一个培养计划，并且编写了讲义。开始按计划先给杨永泉讲预防注射、急救、包扎等，效果不好；以后就用带徒弟的方法，培养杨永泉。每天，杨永泉跟着他们一起看病、注射、包扎、发药，他们一边作，一边讲。看什么病就讲什么病的特征及处理方法，发药时就告诉他药的性能。在出诊的路上，在治病的每一个间隙，他们结合看过的病，耐心而细致地告诉杨永泉。晚上，就和杨永泉作一天的小结，结合讲一般的医学理论知识。慢慢地，杨永泉就掌握了三十多种常见疾病的预防、诊断及处理，掌握了七十多种药物的性能及用法，还掌握了换药、包扎、人工呼吸、注射、针灸、按摩等技术。从此，东一村有了自己的保健员。
    现在，北京医学院的学生已经离开了东一村，杨永泉在业务上遇到问题时，还给他们写信询问，亲切地称他们“老师”，而他提出的问题也会得到满意的答复。
    小慧霞脱险了
    事情发生在昌平区路庄村。才出生九个月的女孩邵慧霞得了麻疹。小慧霞的爸爸和妈妈及当地的大夫都认为没有希望了。在这里实习的北京医学院学生决心尽力想办法抢救小慧霞。
    学生们用药物和注射治疗，小慧霞的病情逐渐好转。但是孩子的眼睛角膜有白膜，严重缺乏维生素A·D，继续下去，有失明的危险。他们连续给孩子注射了三针维生素A·D，但见效很慢。怎么办？如果把维生素A·D滴入眼里，效果会大，可是，直接滴要多少浓度？有没有刺激性？他们都不知道。为了不致给孩子带来不良后果，共产党员高映祥就先用自己的眼睛作了试验。
    经过六天治疗，小慧霞脱险了。小慧霞的父亲是生产队的干部，生产队特别写了感谢信给学生们。社员们说：从来没有见过这样的医生。真是共产党、毛主席教的好。
    看，他们多么关怀孩子
    一天，北京医学院在石景山钢铁公司劳动和生产实习的学生给工人念完了报，又讲了讲怎样预防感冒，接着便闲聊起来。学生们知道工人老张的小孩咳嗽很厉害时，非常关心，根据症状，初步断定是百日咳。学生们在农村劳动实习时，曾用猪苦胆治疗百日咳很有效。但现在这里没有这种药，老张和学生们都很着急。于是，学生们连忙写信请在乡下的同学寄来。他们还到处打听哪里有屠宰场，准备自己制作这种药。
    四点下班后，有的学生赶忙同外面联系，另外两个女学生到工人家属宿舍看望小孩，小孩果然患的是百日咳。她们还到别的工人家看有没有被传染上百日咳的小孩。
    忙了一阵以后，夜深了，药仍无头绪，大家都很焦急。不一会儿，一位同学兴冲冲地跑来告诉大家，他从电话上联系到某医疗单位有这种药，同学们高兴得跳了起来，立即派人通知了老张。
    第三天上班的时候，老张笑容满面逢人便说：“我的小孩咳嗽好多了。”他拉着学生们的手说：
  “你们和我们一块劳动，又帮助我们解决困难，你们真是未来的好大夫。”（附图片）
