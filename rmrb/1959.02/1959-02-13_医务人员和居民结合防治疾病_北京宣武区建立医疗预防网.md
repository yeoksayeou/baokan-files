Medical Personnel and Residents Combine to Prevent and Control Diseases
Xuanwu District, Beijing, Establishes Medical Prevention Network

    (Our report) The Xuanwu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing has mobilized medical personnel and residents to establish a medical prevention network centered on hospitals, along with mass disease prevention organizations, effectively combating diseases. Since winter, it has controlled the spread of diseases such as measles.
    Since the beginning of winter, the Xuanwu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing has strengthened its leadership over health work, establishing disease prevention and control headquarters at all levels to specifically address winter disease prevention. In order to fully utilize the role of all medical personnel in the district, scattered clinics, health stations, and private practitioners of both Chinese and Western medicine were unified and organized. Based on the needs of residents, adjustments were made to the original medical institutions to ensure the rational distribution of technical personnel and Chinese and Western medicine practitioners in all areas of the district. Each grassroots medical institution was equipped with departments of internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and obstetrics. At the same time, the system of designated neighborhood doctors was implemented. The four municipal hospitals in the district, including the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital, served as centers, and these hospitals dispatched experienced doctors to guide the disease prevention and control work of the grassroots medical institutions in each of the four areas into which the district was divided. Each hospital and grassroots medical institution is responsible for a specific area, generally one medical institution serving a population of over 20,000. Medical personnel participating in neighborhood work form mutual aid groups, responsible for the work of a small area, with each person assigned to manage a certain number of households, each having fixed clients. The neighborhood doctors spend half a day in outpatient treatment and the other half going into the neighborhoods to conduct propaganda, investigation and research, prevention, treatment, and nursing.
    In order to combine the strength of the professional medical team with the strength of the broad masses of residents, more than 4,000 health workers have been trained in government offices, schools, enterprises, factories, and among residents. These health workers are health propagandists, regularly conducting health education among residents, and are also assistants to the neighborhood doctors, keeping abreast of the health status and disease incidence of each household. Through them, the work of medical personnel is combined with the struggle of the broad masses of residents to prevent and control diseases, forming a mass medical prevention network.
    This approach in Xuanwu District, Beijing, provides favorable conditions for carrying out medical prevention work in a comprehensive and planned manner. Taking measles prevention as an example, each neighborhood doctor, in cooperation with health workers in the community, and through various means, widely and deeply conducted propaganda and education among residents on the prevention and nursing of measles. At the same time, they also conducted door-to-door investigations to understand the situation of young children who are susceptible to measles, ensuring they were fully informed. Due to the adoption of these preventive measures, the number of cases has been greatly reduced.
    Due to the close contact and collaboration between neighborhood doctors and health workers, through reports from health workers and daily visits and searches by neighborhood doctors, the epidemic situation can be grasped in a timely manner; some children's symptoms are detected before they even develop. For children who have already developed the disease, the neighborhood doctors universally worked tirelessly to provide patient and meticulous nursing guidance and timely treatment, greatly reducing complications.

    医务人员和居民结合防治疾病
    北京宣武区建立医疗预防网
    本报讯　中共北京市宣武区委发动医务人员和居民结合，建立起以医院为中心的医疗预防网，和群众性的卫生防病组织，有效地同疾病展开斗争。自冬季以来，已控制了麻疹等疾病的发展。
    入冬以来，中共北京宣武区委加强对卫生工作的领导，建立了各级防治疾病指挥部，具体抓冬季防治疾病工作。为了充分发挥全区医务人员的作用，把过去分散的诊所、保健站以及开业中西医务人员统一组织起来，根据居民的要求对原有医疗机构进行调整，使全区各个地段的技术力量、中西医，合理分布，每个基层医疗机构在医疗方面，都配备内、外、儿、妇产等科室。同时开始实行地段医师负责制，以分布在区内的市辖中苏友谊医院等四个医院为中心，把全区街道划分为四片，由这四个医院派出水平较高的医师，分别指导各片基层医疗机构的防治疾病工作。各医院及基层医疗机构，都要负责一定的地段工作，一般的一个医疗机构负责两万多人口的地区。参加地段工作的医务人员，组成互助组，负责一个小片的工作，每人在片内分管一定户数，每个人都有固定的工作对象。地段医师半天作门诊治疗、半天深入地段进行宣传、调查研究、预防、治疗和护理等工作。
    为了把医务人员的专业队伍的力量与广大居民的力量结合起来，在机关、学校、企业、工厂以及居民中，训练培养了四千多名卫生员。这些卫生员是卫生宣传员，经常向居民进行卫生常识教育，又是地段医师的助手，及时掌握各户居民的健康情况和发病情况。通过他们，使医务人员的工作和广大居民防治疾病的斗争结合起来，形成一个群众性的医疗预防网。
    北京市宣武区的这种做法，为全面而有计划地进行医疗预防工作提供了有利的条件。以防治麻疹来说，每一地段医师通过和居民中的卫生员合作，通过各种方式，广泛而深入地对居民进行了关于麻疹的预防和护理常识的宣传教育，同时，他们还挨门逐户地调查了解易于感染麻疹的幼儿的情况，做到了心中有数。由于采取了这些预防措施，大大地减少发病人数。
    由于地段医师和卫生员的密切联系和协作，经过卫生员报告和地段医师每天的探视、搜索，一有疫情即能够及时掌握；有些孩子的病症，在没发作前就被掌握。对已发病的孩子，地段医师普遍地废寝忘食地进行耐心细致的护理指导和及时治疗，大大减少了合并症。
