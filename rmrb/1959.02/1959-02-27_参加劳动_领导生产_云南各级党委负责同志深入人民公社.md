Participating in Labor, Leading Production
Yunnan's Party Committees at All Levels Go Deep into People's Communes

(Our newspaper's reporter Zhang Tinggan reports) To further strengthen ties with the masses, the Chinese Communist Party Yunnan Provincial Committees at all levels are, with the First Secretary taking the lead, going to people's communes to participate in labor and grassroots work.

The responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee and a group of cadres went to the Penglai People's Commune in Yiliang County on January 15th. They participated in production while understanding production, rectification, and other situations in the commune, eating together with commune members in the public canteen. When the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee were accumulating fertilizer with the masses, they discussed how to expand fertilizer sources, strengthen organizational work, increase the quantity of fertilizer, and improve its quality. When eating in the canteen, seeing that the comrades who cooked threw away the water from washing rice, they immediately discussed with the cooks and stewards how to use this nutrient-rich rice water to feed pigs. Later, they also studied with the masses and cadres how to save food and expenses, so that everyone could eat their fill and eat well. After repeated discussions and practice, they found some good and economical management methods. The Penglai People's Commune implemented a distribution system combining wages and supply, especially with free meals, which everyone was satisfied with. However, initially, the supply portion accounted for about four-fifths of the consumption distributed to commune members, which made some commune members less flexible and also easily affected the enthusiasm of some commune members with strong labor power, small families, and lighter burdens to a certain extent. After the responsible comrade of the Provincial Party Committee discovered this problem, he pointed out to the commune cadres that it is necessary to combine strengthening communist education for the masses, carrying forward the communist style, and correctly implementing the current policy of distribution according to labor, in order to maximize the enthusiasm of the masses for production. On the one hand, they organized several forums and discussions among cadres and the masses, appropriately adjusting some items in the original supply system and increasing the proportion of the wage portion. Preliminary calculations showed that it could be roughly half and half.

The First Secretaries of the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, the Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, the Zhaotong Special District, and many county Party committees have also gone to the communes to serve as commune members for a period of time. After the First Secretary of the CPC Dali Prefectural Committee went to the "August 1st" People's Commune in Xiangyun County as a commune member, he participated in accumulating fertilizer during the day, understood the ideological situation of the commune members, and studied work with the commune Party committee at night. The fertilizer accumulation upsurge in this commune had not yet formed in the previous period, so the Prefectural Party Secretary helped the commune Party committee formulate a fertilizer accumulation plan, specifically arranged the labor force, and also cultivated the Shalong Brigade, which had done a better job in fertilizer accumulation, as a typical example, and convened a commune-wide on-site fertilizer accumulation meeting. In this way, the whole commune quickly set off a fertilizer accumulation upsurge. He also discovered in his common labor and common life with the commune members that everyone's understanding of the correct implementation of the principle of distribution according to labor was not clear enough, so he helped the commune Party committee to solve this problem specifically.

In the six counties of Wenshan Autonomous Prefecture, the First Secretaries of five county Party committees are serving as commune members in various communes. Each of them has conducted a lot of investigation and research on the ideological situation of the farmers after joining the commune, the ideological work, rectification, production and mass life of the commune.

### 参加劳动  领导生产  云南各级党委负责同志深入人民公社

    参加劳动  领导生产
    云南各级党委负责同志深入人民公社
    本报讯　记者张廷干报道：中共云南省各级党委为了进一步密切与群众的联系，正由第一书记带头到人民公社参加劳动和基层工作。
    省委负责同志和一批干部，于1月15日到宜良县蓬莱人民公社，一面参加生产，一面了解生产、整社等情况，在公共食堂里同社员们一块吃饭。省委负责同志在同群众一起积肥时，和大家研究了怎样扩大肥源，加强组织工作，增加肥料数量和提高质量的问题。在食堂吃饭时，看到做饭的同志把淘米水倒到地下丢了，便立即和炊事员、事务长等商量，利用这些富有养分的米水喂猪。后来，他们又和群众、干部研究怎样节省粮食和开支，又使大家吃饱、吃好。经过反复讨论和实践，找出了一些又好又省的管理办法。蓬莱人民公社实行了工资制与供给制相结合的分配制度，特别是吃饭不要钱，人人满意。但起初供给部分约占分配给社员消费部分的五分之四，这就使一些社员机动较少，也容易在一定程度上影响一些劳动力强、人口少、负担较轻的社员的积极性。省委负责同志发现这个问题后，便一面向公社干部指出：必须把加强对群众的共产主义教育、发扬共产主义的风格，与正确执行按劳分配的现行政策结合起来，才可能最大限度地鼓舞群众的生产积极性。一面在干部和群众中，组织多次座谈讨论，适当地调整了原定的供给制中的一些项目，增加了工资部分的比重，初步核算结果，大体上可以做到各半。
  大理白族自治州、文山僮族苗族自治州、昭通专区等地以及不少县委的第一书记，也都到公社去当一个时期的社员。中共大理地委第一书记到祥云县“八一”人民公社当社员后，白天参加积肥，了解社员思想情况；晚上与公社党委一起研究工作。这个公社前段时间积肥高潮还未形成，地委书记便帮助公社党委作出了积肥的规划，具体安排了劳动力，还培养了积肥工作较好的沙龙大队作典型，召开了公社的积肥现场会议。这样，全公社很快就掀起了积肥高潮。他还在与社员们的共同劳动和共同生活中，发现大家对正确地贯彻执行按劳分配的原则，思想上还不够明确，就帮助公社党委具体解决这个问题。
    文山自治州六个县，有五个县委第一书记正在各公社里当社员，每人都就农民加入公社后的思想情况，公社的思想工作、整社、生产和群众生活等问题，进行了许多调查研究。
