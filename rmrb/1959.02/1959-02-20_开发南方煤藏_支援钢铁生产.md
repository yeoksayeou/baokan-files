    Developing Southern Coal Deposits to Support Steel Production
    Jiangxi Determined to Build a Southern Coal Industry Base
    Hubei Breaks "No Coal" Theory; Construction Begins on E'nan Coal Mine
    Fujian Zhangping Coal Production to Increase Eighteen-Fold Compared to Last Year
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 19th: Jiangxi's 130,000 coal miners are determined to build Jiangxi into a southern coal industry base.
    Currently, the province's coal mining industry has achieved great success in both production and capital construction. The raw coal output in January reached more than 670,000 tons, equivalent to 4.6 times that of the same period last year. In terms of capital construction, the province has completed 20 formal mines with a designed capacity of 5.19 million tons; 972 temporary small coal mines with a designed capacity of 3 million tons. In addition, 5,600 small coal kilns and 67 small open-pit coal mines have been developed. The development of coal washing and coking is even faster. In the past, only the Pingxiang Coal Mine could do some coal washing and coking. Now, not only has the Pingxiang Coal Mine built two coal washing plants with an annual output of 800,000 tons of refined coal, but also more than 1,600 "Pingxiang Coal Mine style" indigenous coking furnaces and simple coal washing troughs have been built at various coal mine bases throughout the province, basically breaking through the technical barriers of coal washing and coking, and producing a large number of refined coal and good coke to support steel production.
    Driven by steel as the key link, Jiangxi Province's coal industry has developed rapidly. Last year, the province's raw coal output reached more than 7 million tons, equivalent to 2.6 times that of 1957. At the same time, after preliminary exploration, it was found that Jiangxi has extremely rich coal reserves, with 69 of the province's 82 counties having coal mines. Based on the above situation, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, while summarizing the achievements and experiences of the great leap forward in the coal industry in 1958, decided to further develop the coal industry to meet the needs of the province and brother provinces in the East China Cooperation Zone for coal and coke.
    The Provincial Party Committee's determination to build Jiangxi into a southern coal base has greatly encouraged the 130,000 coal workers in the province, and a "four comparisons and four competitions" production competition movement of "comparing energy, competing skill, comparing quantity, competing quality, comparing speed, competing safety, comparing mutual assistance, and competing cooperation" has been quickly launched.
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 19th: Hubei Province is stepping up preparations to build a huge coal base between Wuchang and Puqi counties to change the province's coal shortage. This base has been named E'nan Coal Mine. Construction of 41 pairs of mines will begin this year, reaching an annual output of 6.87 million tons of coal. After its third-phase project is completed in 1961, it will reach an annual output of more than 17 million tons, close to the province's planned coal consumption this year, which can meet the coal needs of industrial bases such as Wuhan and Huangshi in terms of quantity. Now the mine construction company has been established, and the construction of three pairs of mines has begun in Wuchang.
    Hubei Province has extremely rich coal mines with excellent quality. However, since Zhang Zhidong's failure to mine coal at Wangsanshi in Daye, the fallacy of "Hubei has no coal for industrial use" spread by British mining engineers has been circulating. Therefore, for a long time, more than 90% of the province's coal consumption has relied on supplies from other provinces, with an average transportation cost of 11 yuan per ton of coal, which has caused a great burden on railways and shipping. Since the mass campaign for steelmaking began in September last year, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has proposed "smashing the theory of 'Hubei has no coal'," organized relevant departments for debates, and mobilized the masses to find coal resources. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, people from all over the area went to the mountains to find coal, and as a result, coal deposits were found in 54 of the province's 71 counties, and thousands of small coal kilns were built. Cadres from the Hubei Provincial Department of Industry also went to Wuchang, Jiayu and other places to investigate, and combined with exploration and drilling, finally found this huge coal mining area on both sides of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway.
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 19th: In order to solve the province's coal supply problem, Fujian Province has decided to further develop the province's largest coal base, the Zhangping Bituminous Coal Mine, this year, and plans to produce 580,000 tons of bituminous coal this year, an increase of more than eighteen times compared to last year.
    The Zhangping Bituminous Coal Mine was discovered and started construction during the mass campaign for steelmaking last year. Before this, Fujian only had anthracite coal, and the bituminous coal needed for industry was transported from afar from Northeast China, Shandong and other places. After the development of Zhangping Bituminous Coal, Fujian Province's fuel coal for thermal power generation, trains, ships, and coke raw materials for some small blast furnaces can be gradually self-sufficient. According to preliminary surveys, the long-term reserves of this coal mine reach more than 460 million tons. It began to be mined by indigenous methods in September last year, and 30,000 tons of coal had been mined by the end of the year.
    In order to realize this year's development plan, Fujian Province has decided to establish a number of mechanized production mines on the mine. Currently, hundreds of geological workers are further exploring geological conditions. The road from the mining area to the Yingxia Railway is being widened, and new roads are being built to extend to new mines. A large number of workers have also arrived at the construction site.

    开发南方煤藏　支援钢铁生产  
    江西决心建成为南方煤炭工业基地
    湖北大破无煤论鄂南煤矿开始兴建
    福建漳平煤产量将比去年增十八倍
    据新华社南昌19日电　江西全省十三万煤矿工人决心把江西建成为南方的煤炭工业基地。
    现在，全省煤矿工业在生产和基建方面都已获得巨大成绩，1月份的原煤产量已达六十七万多吨，等于去年同期的四点六倍。在基建方面，全省已建成正式矿井二十对，设计能力达五百一十九万吨；临时出煤小井九百七十二个，设计能力达三百万吨。此外，还开采了五千六百个小煤窑和六十七个小型露天煤矿。在洗煤炼焦方面发展得更快，过去只有萍乡煤矿能搞点洗煤炼焦，目前不仅萍乡煤矿建起了两座年产八十万吨精煤的洗煤厂，还在全省的各个煤矿基点建起了一千六百多个“萍矿式”的土法炼焦炉和简易洗煤槽，基本上突破了洗煤炼焦技术关，生产出大批精煤好焦支援钢铁生产。
    在以钢为纲的带动下，江西省的煤炭工业发展很快。去年全省原煤产量达七百多万吨，等于1957年的二点六倍。同时经过初步勘查，发现江西的煤矿蕴藏量极为丰富，全省的八十二个县就有六十九个县有煤矿。根据上述情况，中共江西省委在总结1958年煤炭工业大跃进的成就和经验的同时，决心进一步发展煤炭工业，以满足本省和华东协作区各兄弟省对煤、焦的需要。
    省委要把江西建设成为南方煤炭基地的决心，大大地鼓舞了全省十三万煤炭工人，一个“比干劲赛巧劲、比数量赛质量、比速度赛安全、比互助赛协作”的“四比四赛”生产竞赛运动很快就开展起来了。
    据新华社武汉19日电　湖北省正加紧在武昌和蒲圻两县之间筹建一个巨大的煤炭基地，以改变本省缺煤的情况。这个基地已定名为鄂南煤矿。今年就要动工兴建四十一对矿井，达到年产六百八十七万吨煤炭。它的三期工程在1961年建成后，将达到年产一千七百多万吨，接近今年全省的计划用煤量，能在数量上满足武汉、黄石等工业基地的用煤需要。现在建井公司已经成立，并在武昌着手建设三对矿井。
    湖北省的煤矿极为丰富，并且品质优良。但从张之洞在大冶王三石采煤失败以来，就流传着英国矿师所说的“湖北无工业用煤”的谬论。因此，长期以来，全省90％以上的用煤都靠外省供应，平均每吨煤的运输费用高达十一元，并给铁路、航运造成极大负担。从去年9月全民大办钢铁运动开始，中共湖北省委就提出“大破‘湖北无煤论’”，组织有关部门大辩论，并发动群众寻找煤的资源。各地人民都在党委领导下，上山找煤，结果在全省七十一个县中，查出五十四县都有煤藏，并办起数千个小煤窑。湖北省工业厅的干部也分头到武昌、嘉鱼等地调查，并结合勘察和钻探，终于在京广线两侧查出这个巨大的煤矿区。
    据新华社福州19日电　福建省为解决本省煤炭供应问题，决定今年进一步开发本省最大的煤炭基地——漳平烟煤矿，计划今年产烟煤五十八万吨，比去年增加十八倍多。
    漳平烟煤矿是在去年全民大办钢铁运动中发现并开始建设的。在此以前，福建只有无烟煤，工业上需要的烟煤都是从东北、山东等地远道运来的。漳平烟煤开发后，福建省火力发电、火车、轮船的燃料用煤和部分小高炉的焦炭原料，就可逐步自给一部分。这个煤矿据初步勘测，远景储量达四亿六千多万吨，去年9月开始就用土办法进行开采，到年底已采煤三万吨。
    为实现今年的开发计划，福建省决定在矿上建立一批机械化生产的矿井。现在，几百个地质工作人员正在进一步勘探地质情况。从矿区通往鹰厦铁路的公路正在加宽路面，并新修公路伸延到新矿井去。大批工人也已到达工地。
