The youth members of the Xingxing Commune in Guanghan County, Sichuan Province, have successfully experimented with a "multiple-pot boiling fertilizer, burning fertilizer in the stove, and extracting fertilizer from the smoke" three-in-one method for making fertilizer. This can save manpower and fuel, and the quality of the fertilizer is also higher.

This method is very simple. Just dig a pit four feet deep, tamp the foundation, and then build an earthen stove about three zhang long on it. Place a pot on top of the stove, and build a smoke cabinet at the end of the stove with bricks. If there are no bricks, you can use a wall made of mud instead. In this way, comprehensive fertilizer can be boiled in the pot, fertilizer can also be burned in the stove, and the soil blocks in the smoke cabinet can be smoked for a day and a night to become soil-smoked fertilizer, producing 20,000 to 50,000 jin per day. These fertilizers all contain elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.

Because this method is simple, easy to implement, and very effective, Party Branch Secretary Bo Jiachang immediately mobilized the masses to convert the stoves of the three canteens into earthen stoves that combine cooking, smoke-fertilizing, and burning fertilizer to vigorously produce fertilizer.

    一举三得的造肥法
    四川广汉县星星公社青年社员试验成功了“多锅熬肥，火中烧肥，烟中取肥”一举三得的造肥方法，能节省人力、燃料，肥料质量也较高。
    这个方法很简单，只要将地深挖四尺，夯实地基，再在这上面修一座长约三丈的土灶，上面安上一口锅，灶尾用砖砌一烟柜，如没有砖，也可用泥土筑的墙代替。这样，锅里熬综合化肥，灶里也可烧肥料，烟柜里装上土块熏一天一夜即成土熏肥，每天可生产二至五万斤。这些肥料中，均含有氮、磷、钾等元素。
    由于这个方法简便易行，效果很好，党支部书记薄家昌即发动群众将三个食堂的灶，改为煮饭、熏肥、烧肥三结合的土灶，大力生产肥料。
