Harnessing Electricity from the Min River

The Min River is a tributary of the Yangtze River's upper reaches, originating from the southern foothills of the Min Mountains in Sichuan Province, with a total length of 750 kilometers. The river course is winding and narrow, with rapid currents and extremely rich water resources. However, in the past, it was prone to sudden overflows and floods during the flood season, and water shortages during the dry season. Today, under the leadership of the Party, the local people have devised a seven-stage development plan for the upper reaches of the Min River. Currently, the sixth-stage Zipingpu Hydropower Station and the seventh-stage Dujiangyan Fish Mouth Hydropower Station have commenced construction. Upon completion, these power stations will supply 380,000 kilowatts of electricity to the western Sichuan Plain and the Chengdu area.

The Min River diversion project at the Zipingpu Hydropower Station adopted the open channel diversion method, which shortened the construction period by two months and saved more than 4.4 million yuan compared to tunnel diversion. This is the diverted open channel; the left picture shows the Min River after the cutoff.

    向岷江要电
    岷江是长江上游的一条支流，发源于四川省岷山南麓，全长七百五十公里。河道弯曲、狭窄，水流湍急，水力资源极为丰富。可是在过去，洪水期间骤溢泛滥，枯水季节又缺水。今天党领导当地人民作出了岷江上游的七级开发方案。现在第六级紫坪铺电站和第七级都江堰鱼嘴电站都已动工兴建。这些电站建成后，将供给川西平原和成都地区三十八万瓩的电。
