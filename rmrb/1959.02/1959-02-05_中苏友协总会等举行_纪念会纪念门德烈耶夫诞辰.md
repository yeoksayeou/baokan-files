Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, China Association for Science and Technology, Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the preparatory committee of the Beijing Association for Science and Technology jointly sponsored a commemorative meeting at the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Hall on the evening of the 4th to mark the 125th anniversary of the birth of the great Russian scientist Dmitri Mendeleev.

Hou Debang, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology, presided over the meeting. Zhang Qinglian, a professor at Peking University, delivered a report entitled "The Great Scientist Mendeleev." In his speech, Hou Debang said that it is of particular significance that we commemorate Mendeleev at the time of the 21st Extraordinary Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He wished the CPSU's magnificent seven-year plan would be completed ahead of schedule and that Soviet science would make greater contributions to the cause of world peace. In his report, Zhang Qinglian said that Mendeleev was the discoverer of one of the basic laws of natural science—the periodic law of chemical elements. He was not only the greatest scientist in Russia but also one of the most outstanding scientists in the world.

Visiting Soviet chemical expert Professor Yanko spoke at the meeting. He said that Mendeleev was a brilliant scholar, a great patriot, and a social activist. Mendeleev attached great importance to the creative power of the Chinese people during his lifetime. He said, let our two countries use greater achievements in science and technology to benefit mankind.

The attendees of the commemorative meeting also included: Shao Lizi, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Ge Baoquan, Deputy Secretary-General; Razdukhov, a responsible staff member of the Soviet Embassy; Zhang Zigao, Vice President of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Wang Shuzhuang, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Association for Science and Technology; and more than 800 workers, students, and science enthusiasts.

After the meeting, the latest Soviet scientific film "The Great Victory of Mankind" and the feature film "Milestones of the Beacon Fire" were screened.
