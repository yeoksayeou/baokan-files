Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd -- Beijing's January industrial production plan was victoriously completed on January 31st, with a total output value increase of 275.3% compared to the same period last year.

The basic experiences of Beijing in completing the January plan are: First, deeply study the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, vigorously carry out mass movements; second, leaders at all levels grasp specifically, early, and tightly.

Around the New Year, factories and mines in Beijing organized the broad masses of workers and staff to study the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and conscientiously summarized the rich experiences of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Through study and summary, the masses realized that this year is a year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, the tasks are heavy, and they must continue to exert their energy to overcome difficulties, and make the greatest efforts to complete the plan. On this ideological basis, factories and mines widely mobilized the masses to discuss the January production plan and formulate specific measures to complete the plan. Therefore, the workers and staff had full confidence and tried every means to overcome difficulties.

After studying the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the staff and workers of the North China Radio Equipment Factory realized that the factory's task was more than four times greater than last year, and the products were more advanced and complex than last year. Only by mobilizing the masses, boosting morale, and fighting hard from the very beginning can the completion of the task be guaranteed. At the same time, a mass inspection was carried out in the factory, and an inspection team of more than 500 people was sent to various workshops to check tasks, check key points, check production order, and check technological innovation. Through inspection, 864 problems were found, and measures were taken for each of them. As a result, the factory completed the January production plan one day ahead of schedule, exceeding the target by 17%. The Xinghua Dye Factory lacked chemical raw materials, so the leadership mobilized the masses to attack this key problem, and in only eight hours they built a cuprous chloride workshop with an annual output of 50 tons, and in fifteen days they rebuilt a dye intermediate workshop. In addition, a workshop for producing dye indicators was built. After these workshops were put into production, the January output value plan was completed six days ahead of schedule.

In the mass movement of the Shangyi Winery, the staff and workers of each shift and group formulated plans and measures to complete the plans. Because the masses knew what to do and the completion of the plan was realistically guaranteed, the factory overfulfilled the January plan by 111%, and the output value increased by more than double compared to December last year.

    人不离鞍，马不停蹄，在大跃进的基础上更大跃进
    北京工业战线第一仗打得好
    一月份总产值比去年同期增长了二点七倍
    新华社2日讯　北京市1月份工业生产计划已在1月31日胜利完成，总产值比去年同期增长了275.3％。
    北京市完成1月份计划的基本经验是：一、深入学习党的八届六中全会文件，轰轰烈烈大搞群众运动，二、各级领导抓得具体，抓得早，抓得紧。
    新年前后，北京市各厂矿组织广大职工群众学习了党的八届六中全会文件，并且认真总结了1958年大跃进的丰富经验；通过学习和总结，群众认识到今年是更大更好更全面跃进的一年，任务很重，必须继续鼓足干劲克服困难，尽最大的努力，才能完成计划。在这个思想基础上，各厂矿企业又广泛发动群众讨论了1月份的生产计划，制订了完成计划的具体措施。因此，职工群众信心很足，千方百计克服困难。
    华北无线电器材厂职工学习六中全会文件以后，认识到本厂任务比去年多四倍多，产品也比去年高级复杂，只有一开始就发动群众、鼓足干劲、紧张的战斗下去，才能保证任务的完成。同时，工厂里还开展了群众性的大检查，由五百多人组成的检查团分到各个车间去查任务、查关键、查生产秩序、查技术革命。通过检查，查出了八百六十四项问题，条条都采取了措施，因而全厂提前一天超额17％完成了1月份生产计划。兴华染料厂的化工原料不足，领导上就发动群众围攻这个关键，只用八小时就突击建成了年产五十吨的氯化亚铜车间，十五天改建了一个染料中间体车间，另外还修建了一个生产染料指示剂的车间。这些车间投入了生产以后，提前六天完成了1月份产值计划。
    上义葡萄酒厂在大搞群众运动中，每班、每组的职工都订出了计划和完成计划的措施；由于群众心中有数，计划完成有切实的保证，结果这个工厂超额111％完成了1月份计划，产值比去年12月份提高了一倍多。
