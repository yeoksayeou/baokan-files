    A Sudden Letter

    One morning, Postman Xiao Wang delivered a registered letter and a small package from Zhengzhou. This sudden letter stunned me. I don’t know a single person in Zhengzhou, hundreds of miles away. Who could have sent the letter? Xiao Wang must have delivered someone else's letter by mistake. I looked again carefully, and the recipient's name and address on the envelope were correct. When I opened the letter, I found out that it was sent by a comrade named Wang Qinghe from Zhengzhou. I was almost moved to tears by this sudden letter. The story is like this: Twenty days ago, I went to Zhengzhou on business. Due to carelessness, I lost a handbag (containing two shirts and a notebook). At that time, I looked everywhere for it, but I couldn't find it. Although it has been more than twenty days since I returned, I still often feel sad about losing the handbag. I didn't expect that after more than twenty days, my beloved object would come back. I have never been so happy. I deeply realize that in today's People's China, friends and confidants are everywhere.

    一封突然的来信
    一天上午，邮局小王送来一封由郑州市寄来的挂号信和一个小包裹。这突然的来信把我愣住了。相距几百里路的郑州市，我连一个人也不认识，是谁寄来的信呢？准是小王把别人的信送错了。我再仔细看看，信封上的收信人姓名、地址一点也不错。当我拆开信一看，才知道是郑州市一位叫王清和的同志寄来的，我几乎被这封突然的来信感动的流出泪来。事情是这样的：在二十天前，我因事到郑州，因一时不慎，丢失了一个手提包（里面有两件单衣和一个笔记本），当时到处去找，还是没找到。回来后虽已二十多天了，心里还常为丢失的手提包难过，没想到二十多天后，心爱之物又回来了。我从来也没有这样高兴过。我深深体会到在人民中国的今天，到处是朋友是知己。
