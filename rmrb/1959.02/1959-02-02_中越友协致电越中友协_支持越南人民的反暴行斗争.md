Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association Sends Telegram to Vietnam-China Friendship Association
    Supporting the Vietnamese People's Struggle Against Atrocities

    (Our dispatch) The China-Vietnam Friendship Association sent a telegram to the Vietnam-China Friendship Association on January 31, voicing support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people protesting against the large-scale massacre of patriots by the South Vietnamese authorities.
    The telegram stated: The Ngo Dinh Diem clique of South Vietnam, instigated by U.S. imperialism, has carried out a large-scale massacre of over a thousand Vietnamese patriots in the Phu Loi concentration camp. This shocking fascist atrocity has aroused the immense anger of the entire Chinese people.
    The telegram pointed out that this inhuman and heinous crime by the South Vietnamese authorities is another serious violation of the Geneva Accords, and a grave consequence of U.S. imperialism's blatant interference in South Vietnam.
    The telegram continued, the Chinese people resolutely protest this brutal crime by the South Vietnamese authorities and firmly support the just demands and struggle of the Vietnamese people. The Chinese people can no longer tolerate U.S. imperialism's reckless actions in Asia. U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique must immediately cease this inhuman and barbaric atrocity, and immediately cease all actions that undermine the Geneva Accords. U.S. imperialism must get out of South Vietnam!
    The telegram concluded by pointing out that the brutal bestiality of U.S. imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique reflects the desperation of imperialism and reactionaries in their decline. Their days of demise are not far off, and victory will inevitably belong to the Vietnamese people and all peace-loving and justice-upholding people in the world!
