Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 11th – The resolutions of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have inspired the construction enthusiasm of the entire Soviet people. The movement to strive to become "Communist Labor Brigades" is expanding and deepening.

This new movement, which was born a few months ago, has now spread to all departments of industry, transportation, and construction, and to the vast rural areas throughout the Soviet Union. According to statistics from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of the Soviet Union, in Moscow alone, there are now more than 2,900 work teams participating in the competition to become "Communist Labor Brigades." In Bashkir, there are more than 700 such work teams, in Belarus there are 1,600, and in Azerbaijan there are 700. There are now more than 35,000 work teams participating in the competition throughout the Soviet Union.

The development of this movement has played a huge role in promoting both industrial and agricultural production, and outstanding work teams are constantly emerging. To date, more than 700 work teams throughout the Soviet Union have won the glorious title of "Communist Labor Brigade." These work teams that have won this glorious title are able to live, work, and study in the communist spirit. For example, the Kochitov work team of the Tula No. 66 Coal Mine recently set a world record for tunneling coal mining, excavating 1,670 meters in a tunnel with a combined coal mining machine in one month. Another example is the Nikolai Voronin work team of the steel pipe manufacturing workshop of the "Red Viborgian" factory in Leningrad, which implemented a non-stop method during shift changes, producing 350 meters more steel pipe per shift. Each member of this work team is also studying technology, and with the help of engineer Radchenko, they are studying how to further improve the operation process and produce new steel pipes.

The Namzaev work team of the "Truth" collective farm in Namangan Oblast, Uzbekistan, not only put forward a guarantee of high production, but also put forward the conditions for the mechanization of all work, improvement of cotton quality, and reduction of costs. All members of this work team participate in agricultural correspondence schools.

Xinhua News Agency, February 10th – According to TASS, Moscow, February 9th: In the past two days, industrial enterprises, collective farms, government agencies, and schools throughout the Soviet Union have held mass rallies to warmly support the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

According to a report in the "Pravda" on the 9th, the speeches of the Soviet working people at the mass rallies vividly reflected their approval of the Communist Party's line stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan, which is a concrete milestone for the gradual transition from socialism to communism.

The working people are supporting the resolutions of the Party Congress with concrete labor guarantees. The miners of the Communist Labor Brigade of the Sverdlov No. 1-2 Mine in Lugansk Oblast (Donbass) put forward the initiative to all Ukrainian miners to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Work team leader Belousov and his members decided to complete the Seven-Year Plan in five years, and strive to extract 82,000 tons of anthracite above the plan during this period.

This work team also signed a competition agreement with the well-known Mamai work team in the country, guaranteeing that each miner will increase labor productivity by 20% during the Seven-Year Plan. Members of the "Soviet State" collective farm in Altai, Western Siberia, also decided to complete the seven-year task of livestock product production in five years.

Thanks to the resolutions of the Congress and the selfless labor of the Soviet people, the economic face of the country, especially the economic face of the eastern region, will become unrecognizable in seven years. Khristianovich, First Deputy Director of the Siberian Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, discussed this situation in an article in "Pravda" on the 9th.

    苏共代表大会鼓舞人民建设热情 
    共产主义劳动队运动遍及全苏
    新华社莫斯科11日电　苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的决议鼓舞了全苏联人民的建设热情。争取作“共产主义劳动队”的运动正在日益扩大和深入。
    这个在几个月以前诞生的新运动现在已经遍及于苏联各地的工业、运输业和建筑业各部门和广大农村。据苏联共产主义青年团中央委员会的统计，现在，单是莫斯科就有二千九百多个工作队参加争取作“共产主义劳动队”的竞赛。在巴什基尔，这样的工作队有七百多个，在白俄罗斯有一千六百个，在阿塞拜疆有七百个。苏联全国现在有三万五千多个工作队参加竞赛。
    这一运动的开展在工农业生产中都起了巨大的推动作用，优秀的工作队不断涌现出来。到目前为止，苏联全国已经有七百多个工作队获得了“共产主义劳动队”的光荣称号。这些获得光荣称号的工作队都能够按共产主义精神来生活、工作和学习。例如，图拉第六十六号煤矿的科契托夫工作队不久前创造了一项坑道采煤的世界纪录，在一个月内用联合采煤机在坑道中掘进了一千六百七十公尺。又如列宁格勒的“红色维堡人”工厂钢管制造车间尼古拉·沃罗宁工作队实行了换班时不停工的方法，使每班多生产三百五十公尺钢管。这个工作队的每个队员还都在钻研技术，他们在工程师拉德钦科的帮助下正在研究进一步改善操作过程和生产新钢管的问题。
    乌兹别克纳曼干州“真理”集体农庄纳姆扎耶夫工作队不但提出高额生产的保证，并且提出了全部工作实行机械化，提高棉花质量，降低成本的条件。这个工作队的队员全部参加农业函授学校学习。
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科9日讯：苏联各工业企业、集体农庄、机关和学校近两天来纷纷举行群众集会，热烈拥护苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议。
    据“真理报”9日报道，苏联劳动人民在群众集会上的讲话鲜明地反映了他们赞同七年计划中所规定的共产党的路线，这个路线是从社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义的具体里程碑。
  劳动人民都以具体的劳动保证来拥护党代表大会的决议。卢加州（顿巴斯）斯维德洛夫一—二号矿井的共产主义劳动队的矿工向乌克兰所有矿工提出了提前完成七年计划的倡议。工作队队长贝洛乌索夫和队员们决定在五年内完成七年计划，并且争取在这个期间内超计划开采八万二千吨无烟煤。
  这个工作队还同国内著名的马马伊工作队签订了竞赛公约，保证每个矿工在七年计划期间提高劳动生产率20％。西伯利亚西部阿尔泰的“苏维埃国家”集体农庄庄员也决定在五年内完成畜牧业产品生产的七年任务。
    由于代表大会的决议和苏联人民的忘我劳动，国家的经济面貌，首先是东部地区的经济面貌在七年中将要变得难以辨认。苏联科学院西伯利亚总分院第一副院长赫里斯齐安诺维奇9日在“真理报”上著文论述了有关这方面的情况。
