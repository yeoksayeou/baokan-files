Desalinating Seawater
学颐

Only those who have lived on islands or spent long periods at sea on ships can truly appreciate how precious fresh water is. Even coastal cities often experience freshwater shortages, hindering industrial and agricultural development.

Is it possible to turn seawater into freshwater? Yes. On average, every hundred catties of seawater contains three and a half catties of various salts. The simplest and most thorough way to remove these salts is through distillation: evaporating the water and leaving the salt behind in the pot. However, this consumes a lot of fuel, making it impractical for widespread use. In recent years, some have designed devices that use solar energy to distill seawater. But because the equipment cost is high, freshwater yield is low, and it is affected by the weather, it cannot yet be used on a large scale.

The ion exchange method can turn seawater into freshwater. When seawater passes through an ion exchanger, the salts in it are absorbed by the anion and cation exchangers, turning it into freshwater.

An ion exchanger is a substance made into granules or spheres. This substance is insoluble in water but can ionize cations or anions. When a saline aqueous solution passes through an ion exchanger, the salts in the water (salts ionize into cations and anions in water) undergo an exchange reaction with the cations or anions ionized from the ion exchanger. The salts in the water are thus removed, turning it into freshwater. The salts exchanged onto the exchanger can then be washed off with other solutions, "reviving" the ion exchanger. The "revived" ion exchanger can then be reused.

However, when using ion exchangers to remove salts from seawater, the high salt content of seawater makes it easy to reach "exchange saturation." It must be "revived" by rinsing before it can be reused, making this method uneconomical. Using ion exchange membranes is much more economical. These are membranes made by crushing ion exchangers and bonding them together with other adhesives (some ion exchangers are made directly into membranes). These membranes are also insoluble in water and have exchange capabilities. When a saline aqueous solution passes between two layers of cation exchange membranes and anion exchange membranes, although the exchange membranes can also reach exchange saturation, an external electric field applied to the outside of the membrane can attract the salt ions exchanged onto the membrane to the outside of the membrane, allowing the ion exchange membrane to continue to produce exchange reactions. Therefore, ion exchange membranes can be used for a long time without the need for rinsing and "revival" procedures, only consuming a little more electricity.

Using this method, the seawater inside the membrane can be desalinated, while the seawater outside can be concentrated (in fact, a multi-layer overlapping device is used, making it impossible to distinguish between the inside and outside).

Now, our country's scientific workers, after a short period of hard work, have mastered the technology of using ion exchange membranes to desalinate seawater. Turning seawater into freshwater is no longer just a beautiful ideal in our country, but is rapidly becoming a large-scale production reality.

    海水变淡水

    只有在海岛上住过，或长期在海轮上生活过的人，才能体会到淡水是多么的宝贵；沿海的城市也是时常感到淡水供应不足，工农业的发展因而受到阻碍。
    能不能把海水变成淡水呢？能。平均每百斤海水含有各种盐类三斤半。要想去掉这些盐，最简单和彻底的办法是蒸馏：把水蒸出来，盐留在锅里。不过这得耗费许多燃料，不可能广泛使用。近几年来已有人设计出用太阳能来蒸馏海水的装置。但是因为设备成本高，淡水产量低，又要受天气的影响，所以还不能大量应用。
    离子交换法可以把海水变成淡水。海水通过离子交换剂，其中的盐就分别被阴阳离子交换剂吸去，变成了淡水。
    离子交换剂是一种做成颗粒状或球状的物质。这种物质不溶于水，但能电离出阳离子或阴离子。当含有盐分的水溶液通过离子交换剂时，水中的盐分（盐在水中电离成阳离子及阴离子）即和离子交换剂上电离出来的阳离子或阴离子发生交换作用，水中之盐分即被脱除成淡水。交换到交换剂上的盐分，可以再用其他溶液冲洗下来，而使离子交换剂“复活”。“复活”后的离子交换剂可以再使用。
    但是，用离子交换剂来脱除海水中的盐分时，由于海水中含盐量很高，很容易达到“交换饱和”。必须经过冲洗“复活”才能再使用，所以这个方法也不经济。用离子交换膜可要经济得多。它是将离子交换剂粉碎以后用其他粘合剂粘起来做成的膜（也有将离子交换剂直接做成膜的）。这种膜同样不溶于水又具有交换能力。当含有盐分的水溶液从两层阳离子交换膜及阴离子交换膜中间通过时，交换膜虽然也能达到交换饱和的情况，但由于膜外侧加有外加电场，可以将交换到膜上的盐分离子吸引到膜外边去，而使离子交换膜能继续产生交换作用。故离子交换膜可长时间使用，不须要冲洗“复活”手续，只是多耗费点电罢了。
    使用这种方法，一方面可使膜内侧的海水变淡，同时还可使外侧海水变浓（实际上是使用多层重叠的装置，分不出那是内侧，那是外侧）。
    现在我国的科学工作者，经过短期苦战已掌握了使用离子交换膜淡化海水的技术。把海水变成淡水，在我国已经不再只是一个美丽的理想，而是很快变成大规模生产的现实了。
