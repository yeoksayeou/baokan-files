Combining Prevention and Production, Combining the Masses and Science
Jiangxi Has Another Four Counties and One City That Have Seen Off the God of Plague

(Reported by this newspaper) Following Yu Jiang and Shang You, Tahe, Wuyuan, Fuliang, Fengxin four counties and Nanchang city in Jiangxi, recently declared the eradication of schistosomiasis. So far, Jiangxi has completely eliminated this disease in more than one-fifth of the schistosomiasis epidemic areas in the province. To celebrate this victory, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee's General Headquarters for Eliminating Pests and Diseases recently held a celebration meeting in Tahe County.

Last year, Chairman Mao's two poems of "Farewell to the God of Plague" written for Yu Jiang County's eradication of schistosomiasis gave the people of Jiangxi tremendous encouragement. Under the leadership of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, the thirty-three epidemic counties and cities in the province launched a high tide of eradicating schistosomiasis with the slogan "Learn from Yu Jiang and take Yu Jiang as an example", pushing this pest and disease elimination work to a new victory. Shang You County took the lead and closely followed Yu Jiang in eradicating schistosomiasis. Following this, Tahe, Wuyuan, Fuliang, Fengxin four counties and Nanchang city also successively reported good news. Twelve counties and cities, including Wannian and Anyi, have basically eliminated schistosomiasis.

While engaging in the great leap forward in production last year, Party committees at all levels in Jiangxi Province conscientiously implemented the Central Committee’s policy of "combining prevention and treatment with agricultural production, and combining mass movements with science and technology," closely integrated with production, made unified arrangements, and put forward specific measures. For example, in conjunction with water conservancy construction, the renovation of field ditches, and drought prevention and irrigation, mass campaigns were carried out to eliminate snails; in conjunction with manure accumulation, fertilizer production, and the movement to eliminate the four pests, excrement was properly managed; and patients were treated during every production gap. Last year alone, the province eliminated snails on an area of more than 1.2 million mu, more than 100 times the total area of snail elimination in the past six years; more than 150,000 patients were treated, more than double the total number of people treated in the past six years.

In the province's vigorous prevention and treatment work, the Provincial Party Committee's General Headquarters for Eliminating Pests and Diseases particularly emphasized being realistic and ensuring the quality of prevention and treatment work. Specialized teams were organized to conduct layer-by-layer inspections and grade-by-grade assessments of places that declared eradication and basic elimination of schistosomiasis. Before Tahe County announced the eradication of schistosomiasis, it re-examined a snail distribution area of 8,527 square meters and found only one live snail, with the snail density per square meter reduced to 0.000117; Fuliang County re-examined the feces of more than 2,600 people in the epidemic area three times, finding only 19 patients with relapsed disease and 3 new patients, with a positive rate reduced to 0.82%, and all have been cured. Areas that did not meet the standards after inspection continued to receive serious remedial classes.

At this celebration meeting, based on summarizing and exchanging the experiences of advanced regions, further tasks were put forward for the future. It was required that all regions must continue to implement political leadership, boost greater enthusiasm, vigorously promote mass movements, vigorously promote technological innovation, and adopt a combination of Chinese and Western methods, and indigenous and foreign methods, in order to strive for greater victories in the work of eliminating pests and diseases. The Poyang Lake area proposed to wage a major battle in Poyang Lake this spring to wipe out the snails in the lake area in one fell swoop, and strive for the complete eradication of schistosomiasis in the lake area counties and cities.

For counties and cities that have eradicated and basically eliminated schistosomiasis, it is required to prevent the ideological emotions of arrogance and paralysis, and continue to divide the original snail distribution areas into production teams, re-examining the snail elimination effect every three months, and eliminating them whenever they are found; grassroots health organizations should conduct a stool re-examination of treated patients every three months, and immediately re-treat any relapsed patients; systems for managing excrement and protecting water sources should be established.

### 防治和生产相结合　群众和科学相结合  江西又有四县一市送走了瘟神

    防治和生产相结合　群众和科学相结合
    江西又有四县一市送走了瘟神
    本报讯　江西最近又有泰和、婺源、浮梁、奉新四县和南昌市，紧继余江、上犹之后宣布根除了血吸虫病。至此，江西已经在全省五分之一以上的血吸虫病流行区彻底消灭了这种疾病。为庆祝这个胜利，最近中共江西省委除害灭病总指挥部在泰和县召开了庆功大会。
    去年，毛主席为余江县根除血吸虫病写的“送瘟神”两首诗，给江西人民以巨大的鼓舞。在中共江西省委的领导下，全省三十三个疫区县市，掀起了“向余江看齐，学余江榜样”的根除血吸虫病高潮，把这项除害灭病工作推向了新的胜利。上犹县一马当先紧随余江之后，根除了血吸虫病。接着，泰和、婺源、浮梁、奉新四县和南昌一市又相继传出了捷报，还有万年、安义等十二个县市达到了基本消灭血吸虫病。
    在去年生产大跃进的同时，江西省各级党委认真地贯彻执行了中央关于“防治工作和农业生产相结合，群众运动和科学技术相结合”的方针，紧密结合生产，作了统一安排，提出了具体措施。例如，结合兴修水利、整修田沟、防旱排灌等工作，大搞突击灭螺；结合积肥、造肥、除四害运动，管理好粪便；抓住各个生产空隙治疗病人。去年一年中，全省灭螺面积达一百二十多万亩，超过以往六年灭螺面积总和的一百倍；治疗病人十五万多，超过以往六年治病人数总和的一倍多。
    在全省轰轰烈烈开展防治工作中，省委除害灭病总指挥部特别强调了实事求是、确保防治工作的质量。对宣布根除和基本消灭血吸虫病的地方，都组织了专门力量进行了层层的检查和级级的鉴定。泰和县在宣布根除血吸虫病之前，复查了钉螺分布面积八千五百二十七个平方公尺，只发现一只活螺，每平方公尺的钉螺密度已降低到0.000117只；浮梁县对疫区的二千六百多人进行了三次粪便复查，只发现治愈复发病人十九人和三例新病人，阳性率降低到0.82％，并且已经全部治愈。对经检查不够标准的地区都继续认真进行了补课。
    这次庆功大会，在总结交流先进地区经验的基础上，进一步提出了今后的任务。要求各地在除害灭病工作中，必须继续贯彻政治挂帅，鼓起更大的干劲，大搞群众运动，大搞技术革新，采取中西结合、土洋并举的办法，争取除害灭病工作的更大胜利。鄱阳湖滨地区提出要在今春大战鄱阳湖，一举歼灭湖区钉螺，争取湖区县市全部根除血吸虫病。
    对已经根除和基本消灭血吸虫病的县市，要求防止骄傲麻痹的思想情绪，应继续把原有的钉螺分布地区划片包到生产队，每隔三个月复查一次灭螺效果，随时发现随时消灭；基层卫生组织要每隔三个月对治疗过的病人进行一次粪便复查，发现复发病人立即复治；要订立管理粪便和保护水源工作的制度。
