Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Minister of Foreign Trade Ye Jizhuang hosted a banquet tonight to celebrate the signing of seven documents between China and Vietnam related to economic cooperation and trade exchanges.

Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo, and Vice Ministers of Foreign Trade Lei Renmin and Li Qiang attended the banquet.

The head of the Vietnamese government economic delegation, Minister of Industry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam Le Thanh Nghi, the Chargé d'affaires ad interim of Vietnam in China, Pham Binh, and members of the Vietnamese government economic delegation were invited to attend the banquet.

Ye Jizhuang said at the banquet that the signing of the seven documents related to economic cooperation and trade exchanges between China and Vietnam today marks a further development of the economic mutual assistance and cooperation relationship between China and Vietnam, and a further consolidation and strengthening of the fraternal friendship between the governments and peoples of China and Vietnam. He said that in recent years, the economic cooperation and trade exchanges between China and Vietnam have greatly developed on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, mutual assistance and cooperation. Now that our two countries have signed a long-term trade agreement and an agreement on China's economic and technical assistance to Vietnam, this will not only help us arrange production and support each other, but also has important significance and role for the planned and proportionate development of the national economies of China and Vietnam.

Ye Jizhuang said that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is at the forefront of the socialist camp's struggle against imperialism. The Vietnamese people are carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction under the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Lao Dong Party and President Ho Chi Minh in order to strive for the unification, prosperity and strength of the motherland. The great achievements made by the Vietnamese people have given great encouragement to the Chinese people. We are following the struggle and construction of the Vietnamese people with admiration and a sense of shared destiny. Ye Jizhuang then talked about the great leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production. He pointed out that the great achievements of China and Vietnam have enhanced the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union in its peaceful competition with capitalist countries, and have also made great contributions to world peace and the socialist cause.

The head of the Vietnamese government economic delegation, Le Thanh Nghi, said at the banquet that this meeting and the signing of various documents demonstrate that the fraternal mutual assistance and cooperation between Vietnam and China and the traditional friendship between the two peoples, which is as close as brothers and sisters, sharing weal and woe, are developing and consolidating, expanding and deepening day by day. Le Thanh Nghi said that the Vietnamese people and government have always received meticulous care and full support from the Chinese people and government in their revolutionary struggle and economic construction. This time, China's loans and assistance to Vietnam is another valuable help to Vietnam's ongoing socialist revolution and socialist construction, and to the struggle for national reunification. Finally, Le Thanh Nghi said that the Vietnamese people warmly congratulate the great achievements made by the Chinese people in the past year, and congratulate the Chinese people on achieving even greater achievements in this year's greater, better, and more comprehensive great leap forward, in developing a strong socialist industry, and in consolidating people's communes and other construction undertakings.
