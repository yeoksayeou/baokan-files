Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi: The Indian Parliament concluded a week-long discussion on the speech delivered by Indian President Prasad at the joint session of the two houses on the budget issue on the 19th.

The foreign policy proposed by Prasad in his speech received widespread support. Some members condemned the Baghdad Pact Council meeting held in Karachi and called on the government to be vigilant about the military agreement signed between the United States and Pakistan.

Both the People's House and the Federal House focused on domestic issues, among which the policy on India's agricultural development aroused particularly heated debate in Parliament.

The issue of "agricultural organizational forms" was the subject of intense debate at the recent Indian National Congress annual meeting. Some people opposed land reform and the cooperative farming system, but the annual meeting finally passed a resolution by a majority, stipulating that the future agricultural organizational form in India should be cooperative farming cooperatives in which farmers retain land ownership. After the closing of the Congress annual meeting, the state parliaments of various states also launched discussions on this issue. In this parliamentary debate, most Congress members supported the line stipulated in the Congress annual meeting resolution, while only a few Congress members and members of other parties expressed opposition. Among them, the non-party member Masani of the Tata family launched the fiercest attack on the cooperative farming system. Masani publicly stated that if cooperatives were imposed on farmers, "it would lead to civil war and bloodshed." It is said that these people also suggested forming a "Conservative" party to oppose the government's economic policies, including the organization of cooperatives.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru spoke at the parliamentary meeting on the 19th, emphasizing the necessity of implementing cooperative farming in India and accusing Masani of leading people's thinking in a "wrong direction." Nehru pointed out that without cooperatives, Indian farmers would have no future. He said: "I firmly believe that cooperative farming is right... I think that, according to the situation in India, cooperative farming is desirable and beneficial." Nehru also stated that he would travel around the fields to explain to farmers one by one, asking them to agree to participate in cooperative farming.

Home Minister Govind Ballabh Pant said in his speech that an important task of Indian agriculture is to double food production in the next seven years. He said that individual efforts alone would not be fruitful, and a policy of encouraging cooperation must be adopted.

The parliamentary debate also reflected the existence of different opinions on the issue of developing the national economy. For example, one member suggested allowing private capital to participate in the oil industry; Communist Party member Dange demanded strengthening the state-owned sector, and pointed out that American economic "aid" is only given to the private sector, the purpose of which is clearly to influence the country's economy and make it develop in a direction controlled by monopoly capital.

Regarding this issue, Nehru reiterated that "the most important aspects of the economy should be controlled by the state." He said that the private sector in India "has a lot of room for development," but "I don't want it to become the controlling force in the economy." He also said: "We must use such methods to increase our production, so that monopolistic control will not increase but decrease."

People's Socialist Party leader Kripalani's opinions on some national issues are close to those of the Congress Party, but he demanded the establishment of a "government of national unity" as a prerequisite for cooperation between opposition parties and the ruling party. Communist Party member Ahmed once stated in the Federal House that the Indian Communist Party is willing to provide cooperation in the common efforts of the whole country to defend democracy and develop the national economy and culture. He also pointed out that this cooperation should be based on a genuine people's program.

Nehru rejected Kripalani's request to establish a "government of national unity." His reason was: "Because the views of certain parties are so far apart that there is no common ground." However, he also said that he does not rule out the cooperative method of jointly organizing the government, but conditions must be prepared for it.

### 印度议会结束对总统演说的讨论  尼赫鲁强调实行联合耕作  拒绝由各党组织“全民政府”的主张

    印度议会结束对总统演说的讨论
    尼赫鲁强调实行联合耕作
    拒绝由各党组织“全民政府”的主张
    本报讯　新德里消息：印度议会就印度总统普拉沙德在讨论预算问题的两院联席会议上发表的演说进行了历时一周的讨论，讨论已于19日结束。
    普拉沙德在演说中提出的外交政策得到普遍的支持。有些议员谴责了在卡拉奇举行的巴格达条约理事会会议，并要求政府对美国和巴基斯坦签订军事协定一事提高警惕。
    人民院和联邦院都着重讨论了国内问题，其中关于印度发展农业的方针，在议会中引起了特别热烈的辩论。
    关于“农业组织形式”的问题，在不久以前举行的印度国大党年会上就曾进行过激烈的争论，有些人反对土地改革和联合耕种制，但是年会最后以多数通过了决议，规定未来印度的农业组织形式应该是农民保留土地所有权的联合耕作的合作社。国大党年会闭幕后，各邦的邦议会也纷纷就这个问题展开了讨论。在这次议会的辩论中，大多数国大党的议员支持国大党年会决议中规定的路线，只有少数国大党和其他党派议员表示反对，其中无党派议员塔塔家族的马萨尼对联合耕作制攻击最烈，马萨尼公开说：如果把合作社强加在农民身上，“那会导致内战和流血事件”。据说这些人士还建议成立“保守”党来反对政府所推行的包括组织合作社的经济政策。
    印度总理尼赫鲁在议会19日的会议上发言，强调在印度实行联合耕作的必要性，并且指责马萨尼把人民的思想引向“错误的方向”。尼赫鲁指出：没有合作社，印度农民就没有前途。他说：“我坚决相信联合耕作是对的……。我认为，根据印度的情况，联合耕作是可取和有利的。”尼赫鲁并且表示，他将跑遍田野向农民逐个进行解释，要求他们同意参加联合耕作。
    内政部长戈·巴·潘特在发言中认为印度农业的一个重要任务是在今后七年内使粮食产量翻一番。他说，光靠个人努力是不会有成果的，必须采取鼓励合作的方针。
    议会的辩论中也反映出在发展民族经济的问题上存在着不同的意见。例如：有一个议员建议让私人资本参加石油工业；共产党议员丹吉要求加强国营部分，并且指出：美国的经济“援助”只是给私营部分，目的显然是想影响国家的经济，使它向着受垄断资本支配的方向发展。
    关于这个问题，尼赫鲁重申，
  “经济中最主要的方面应由国家控制”。他说：私营部分在印度“有很大的发展余地”，可是，“我并不希望它成为经济中的控制力量”。他还说：“我们必须用这样的方法来增加我们的生产，使得垄断性的控制不会增加而是减少”。
    人民社会党领袖克里帕拉尼在一些全国性的问题上的意见同国大党相接近，然而他要求成立一个“全民政府”作为反对党派同执政党合作的先决条件。共产党议员艾哈迈德在联邦院中曾经表示，印度共产党愿意在全国的共同努力中提供合作，来保卫民主以及发展国民经济和文化。他并且指出，这种合作应当以真正的人民纲领为基础。
    尼赫鲁拒绝了克里帕拉尼关于成立“全民政府”的要求。他的理由是：“因为某些党派的观点相差很远，以至没有共同的基础。”不过，他又说：他并不排斥共同组织政府的合作方式，不过必须为它准备好条件。
