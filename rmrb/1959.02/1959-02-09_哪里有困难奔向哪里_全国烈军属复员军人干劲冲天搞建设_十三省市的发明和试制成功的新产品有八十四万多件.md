Xinhua News Agency, 8th - In the great leap forward of last year, families of martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers across the country demonstrated soaring revolutionary zeal and made tremendous contributions.

"Carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition, determined to be vanguards of the Great Leap Forward!" "Workshops and fields are battlefields, sickles and axes are weapons!" These are the most popular battle slogans among the families of martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled veterans, and especially demobilized soldiers since last year. In rural areas, in order to complete the most arduous tasks in basic farmland water conservancy construction, demobilized soldiers formed shock brigades, hero battalions, vanguard companies, leap forward platoons, and assault teams, rushing to wherever there were difficulties. The 57 demobilized soldiers of the Xunzhen People's Commune in Hequ County, Shanxi Province, known as the "57 Warriors," actively responded to the call of the local Party committee to fight hard for 25 days and nights to realize water conservancy in the river valley. In February last year, they formed a shock brigade and fought hard for six consecutive days and nights in the sub-zero cold and icy river, successfully completing the key project. In Funing County, Hebei Province, 1,000 demobilized soldiers formed 66 shock companies and independently undertook the task of building a 30-li long canal. To build this canal, a mountain ridge had to be tunneled through. The county party committee proposed that it be completed in seven days, but the demobilized soldiers tunneled through it in just one day and one night. In Wushan County, Gansu Province, 400 families of martyrs, families of military personnel, and demobilized soldiers, in participating in the construction of the famous 250-li long Zhongliang Canal project, explored and opened roads on the cliffs at an altitude of 2,200 meters with unparalleled heroism. Together with other migrant workers, they worked hard for four months and finally cut open stone troughs on the high mountains, allowing the river water to rush to the mountains and irrigate 100,000 mu of land. In the high-yield agricultural campaign, families of martyrs, families of military personnel, and demobilized soldiers everywhere vigorously developed high-yield experimental fields. Last year, families of martyrs, families of military personnel, and demobilized soldiers in 25 counties including Renshou County, Sichuan Province, planted more than 62,000 mu of high-yield experimental fields, and the yield of these experimental fields exceeded the yield of ordinary fields in the local area by one to two times.

Families of martyrs and demobilized soldiers are also a shock force in the mass campaign to run industry. According to incomplete statistics from some counties in seven provinces, including Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Gansu, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Hunan, in the past year alone, families of martyrs and demobilized soldiers raised funds themselves or jointly invested with local people to establish a total of 57,208 factories of various types. The families of martyrs and demobilized soldiers in Shanxi Province invested more than 20 million yuan, in addition to establishing various types of factories such as steel, cement, fertilizer, and textile factories, and also built more than 300 factories such as the "August 1st" Iron and Steel Plant. In many areas of Sichuan Province, more than 80% of the demobilized soldiers have joined the steel production front, and thousands of demobilized soldiers in counties such as Fengjie and Nanchuan have also organized "Steel Production Shock Regiments." According to preliminary statistics from 65 counties and cities in the province, there are more than 340 steel plants and iron plants, and 689 indigenous blast furnaces mainly built by demobilized soldiers. In the mass campaign to run industry, the broad masses of families of martyrs and demobilized soldiers have all implemented the principle of "building a business diligently and thriftily, starting from scratch, from small to large, and from nothing to something," overcoming a series of difficulties such as the lack of manpower, materials, and equipment, and creating a large amount of wealth for the country.

In the technological revolution and cultural revolution, the broad masses of families of martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers have carried forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and have innovated and created a large number of new-style tools and machines. According to incomplete statistics from 13 provinces (regions) and cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Shanxi, Gansu, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Hebei, and Guangdong, last year alone, demobilized soldiers invented, created, and successfully trial-produced 845,436 various new products.

In the people's commune system, families of martyrs, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers have actively responded to the call of the Party, striving to take the lead. They have actively participated in various tasks of the people's communes. Many people have become the backbone of industrial and agricultural production in the communes.

The achievements made by the families of martyrs, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers in the Great Leap Forward, as well as their vigorous revolutionary spirit, have been highly praised by the Party and the people, and have won greater honor. During the National Congress of Activists in Socialist Construction of Youth and Women convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the All-China Women's Federation in November and December last year, a large number of advanced figures among the families of martyrs and demobilized soldiers were elected as representatives to participate in these two congresses. Many families of martyrs and demobilized soldiers have also been elected as local people's representatives.

At present, the families of martyrs, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers in various provinces and cities are reviewing their work achievements and exchanging experiences through the local activist congresses held; and in accordance with the spirit of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, they are further organizing their forces to contribute all their strength to a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production this year.

    哪里有困难奔向哪里
    全国烈军属复员军人干劲冲天搞建设
    十三省市的发明和试制成功的新产品有八十四万多件
    新华社8日讯　全国各地的烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人，在去年大跃进中发挥了冲天的革命干劲，作出了巨大的贡献。
    “发扬革命光荣传统，决心作大跃进的尖兵！”“车间、田野当战场，镰刀斧头当刀枪！”这是去年以来在广大烈属、军属、残废军人特别是复员军人中最流行的战斗口号。在农村中的复员军人们为了完成农田水利基本建设中最艰巨的任务，纷纷组成了突击队、英雄营、尖兵连、跃进排、攻坚队，哪里有困难就奔向哪里去。被人们誉为“五十七勇士”的山西省河曲县巡镇人民公社的五十七名复员军人，去年2月间积极响应当地党委提出的苦战二十五昼夜，实现川地水利化的号召，组成了突击队，在零下五度的严寒里，在刺骨的冰河中，一连苦战六昼夜，胜利地完成了关键工程。河北省抚宁县的一千名复员军人，组成了六十六个突击连，单独承担了兴建一条长达三十华里的水渠任务。兴修这条大渠要凿通一条山岭，县委提出要在七天内完成，而复员军人只用一天一夜的时间就凿通了。甘肃省武山县的四百名烈属、军属和复员军人，在参加兴修著名的全长二百五十华里的中梁渠工程中，以无比的英雄气概在拔海二千二百公尺的悬崖绝壁探险开路。他们和其他民工一起经过四个月的苦战，终于在高山峻岭上划开了石槽，使河水奔上高山，让十万亩土地得到了灌溉。在农业丰产运动中，各地的烈属、军属和复员军人大搞丰产试验田。四川省仁寿县等二十五个县的烈军属和复员军人，去年种植了六万二千多亩丰产试验田，这些试验田的产量都超过当地一般田地的产量一倍到两倍。
    烈军属和复员军人在全民办工业运动中也是一支突击力量。据山西、河北、河南、甘肃、四川、广东、湖南等七个省部分县的不完全统计，去年一年，由烈军属和复员军人自己集资或和当地群众合资兴办起来的各种工厂共有五万七千二百零八座。山西省的烈军属和复员军人投资达两千多万元，除办起了钢铁、水泥、化肥、纺织等各种类型的工厂以外，并兴建了“八一”炼铁厂等工厂三百多个。四川省不少地区80％以上的复员军人都投入了钢铁生产战线，奉节、南川等县数以千计的复员军人还组织了“钢铁生产突击团”。据全省六十五个县、市的初步统计，以复员军人为主建设的钢厂、铁厂有三百四十多个，土高炉六百八十九座。广大烈军属和复员军人在大办工业中，都贯彻了“勤俭创业、白手起家、从小到大、从无到有”的原则，克服了人力、物力、设备缺乏等一系列困难，为国家创造了大量财富。
    在技术革命和文化革命运动中，广大烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人发扬了敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，革新和创造了大量新式工具和机器。仅据北京、上海、山西、甘肃、辽宁、陕西、湖南、广西、贵州、浙江、四川、河北、广东等十三个省（区）、市的不完全统计，去年由复员军人发明创造和试制成功的各种新产品就有八十四万五千四百三十六件。
    在人民公社化中，烈军属、残废军人和复员军人更是积极响应党的号召，个个争先带头，他们积极参加人民公社各项工作。许多人成为公社工农业生产中的骨干分子。
    烈军属、残废军人和复员军人在大跃进中取得的这些成就，以及他们那种旺盛的革命斗志，受到党和人民极高的评价，博得了更大的荣誉。去年11、12月间共青团中央和全国妇联先后召开全国青年和妇女社会主义建设积极分子大会时，有很大一部分烈军属和转业军人中的先进人物被选举为代表参加了这两次大会。许多烈军属和复员军人并被选为地方人民代表。
    目前，各省、市的烈军属、残废军人和复员军人正通过当地召开的积极分子大会，检阅自己的工作成就，交流经验；并根据党的八届六中全会决议的精神，进一步组织力量，为今年工、农业生产更大更好更全面的跃进贡献出自己的全部力量。
