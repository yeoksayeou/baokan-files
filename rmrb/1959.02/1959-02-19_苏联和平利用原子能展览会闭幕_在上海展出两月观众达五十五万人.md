Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The Soviet exhibition of science and technology for the peaceful uses of atomic energy, which was held in Shanghai, closed on the 17th. Over the past two months, it has attracted over 550,000 visitors. More than 50,000 of them made a special trip from provinces and cities such as Beijing, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang.

During the exhibition, tens of thousands of visitors meticulously viewed every part of the exhibition each day, and many took notes and copied various charts and models. The messages and discussions from the audience and visiting delegations from other provinces were filled with enthusiastic praise for the Soviet Union's brilliant achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy, and they sincerely thanked the Soviet Union for holding this exhibition in our country, considering it a concrete manifestation of the comprehensive and selfless assistance provided by the Soviet Union to our country.

The exhibition organized various professional study sessions. More than 1,200 scientific research personnel, teachers, and engineers from scientific research institutions, universities, and factories in 25 provinces and cities across the country formed 11 professional study groups, conducting on-site operations and internships under the guidance and assistance of Soviet experts. More than one hundred students also studied in the radioactive radiation measurement training class, basically understanding the performance of radioactive radiation instruments and mastering the methods of using the instruments.

During the exhibition, Soviet experts gave 94 academic reports to our professional study personnel and held more than 30 symposiums with our scientific and technical personnel, enthusiastically discussing scientific issues related to the peaceful use of atomic energy. At the same time, Soviet experts also went to many factories, scientific research units, and hospitals in Shanghai and other places to conduct on-site guidance and experiments. The Soviet experts' rich academic report materials have now been compiled into a book by the exhibition for the relevant units to study and research.

During the exhibition, three films about atomic energy science and technology were also shown: "The Lenin Nuclear Icebreaker," "The Joint Institute for Nuclear Research," and "Atomic Energy, Peace and Friendship." Through the vivid introduction of the films, the audience gained a deeper understanding of scientific and technological knowledge about atomic energy and clearly saw the brilliant example set by the Soviet Union in international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. All exhibits will be transported to Guangzhou for exhibition.

    苏联和平利用原子能展览会闭幕
    在上海展出两月观众达五十五万人
    新华社18日讯　在上海展出的苏联和平利用原子能科学技术展览会，已经在17日闭幕。两个月来，观众达五十五万多人。其中有五万多人是从北京、山东、安徽、江西、福建、浙江等省市专程赶来参观的。
    展出期间，每天有上万的观众细致地参观了展览会的每个部分，许多人做了笔记和描摹了各种图表和模型。观众以及外省参观团的留言和座谈，都充满了对苏联和平利用原子能方面辉煌成就的热情赞赏，并衷心感谢苏联在我国举办这次展览会，认为这是苏联给予我国全面的无私援助的具体表现之一。
    展览会举办了各种专业学习。从全国二十五个省市的科学研究单位、高等学校和工厂来的一千二百多名科学研究人员、教师和工程师，组织了十一个专业学习小组，在苏联专家的指导和帮助下，进行现场操作和实习。有一百多个学员还在放射性辐射测量训练班学习，基本上懂得了放射性辐射仪器的性能，掌握了仪器的使用方法。
    展览会展出期间，苏联专家共为我国专业学习人员作了九十四次学术报告，并且同我国科学技术人员举行了三十多次座谈会，热烈地讨论了关于和平利用原子能方面的科学问题。同时，苏联专家还不辞劳苦地深入到上海和外地的许多工厂、科学研究单位、医院进行现场指导和实验。苏联专家们的丰富的学术报告资料，现已由展览会汇编成册，供各有关单位学习和研究之用。
    在展出期间，展览会还放映了“列宁号原子破冰船”、“联合原子核研究所”、“原子、和平与友谊”等三部有关原子能科学技术的电影。观众通过电影的生动介绍，更深刻地理解了关于原子能的科学技术知识，并且清楚地看到了苏联在和平利用原子能的国际合作方面树立的光辉榜样。展览会全部展品将运往广州展出。
