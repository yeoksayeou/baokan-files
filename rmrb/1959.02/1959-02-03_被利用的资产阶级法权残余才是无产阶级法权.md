    Remnants of Bourgeois Right That Are Exploited Are Precisely Proletarian Right
    Cai Zhongjie
    Recently, after reading Comrade Hou Mingfang's article "Remnants of Bourgeois Right Are Not Bourgeois Right," I agree with some of his arguments, but I feel that he did not explain the issue clearly enough. Therefore, I am writing this article to participate in the discussion on this issue.
    The Change of Right with the Change of Economic Base Requires a Historical Perspective on the Issue of Right
    Right is a part of the superstructure, generated on a certain economic base, embodying the will of the ruling class and serving the interests of the ruling class. Bourgeois right is generated on the basis of capitalist ownership of the means of production, and it serves the bourgeoisie. Proletarian right, on the other hand, is generated on the basis of socialist public ownership of the means of production, and it serves the proletariat. Since right is a part of the superstructure, it will change with the change of the base. Not only will the nature of right undergo fundamental changes when one society replaces another, but within the same society, as the economic base grows, right also undergoes certain changes within its fundamental nature; this change precisely reflects the different degrees of maturity of the economic base. Therefore, the issue of right must be viewed from a historical perspective. For example, bourgeois right uses formal freedom and equality to conceal actual economic and social inequality and to safeguard capitalist private ownership. However, in different periods, some principles of bourgeois right have also changed. In the early stages of capitalism, because the capitalist order had not yet been established, the bourgeoisie used bloody legislation to force workers to work in factories in order to consolidate capitalist labor discipline, and the proletariat could not even talk about formal equality. Later, with the establishment of the capitalist order, the bourgeois parliament promulgated factory laws in order to deceive the working class under the guise of freedom and equality and extract more surplus value. And with the advent of the general crisis of capitalism, the bourgeoisie retracted the banners of democracy, freedom, and equality, and openly implemented fascist dictatorship over the working class and people of all strata. Despite these changes, the fundamental principle remains the same: bourgeois right has not departed from its fundamental nature of serving the capitalist economic base and remains the embodiment of the bourgeois will.
    The will of the proletariat is to realize communism, and everything is for communism, which is proletarian right. However, communist society matures gradually and cannot be established overnight. Under the general principle of conforming to communism, the specific manifestations of proletarian right also differ in various periods. For example, in terms of the distribution system, in the first stage of communism—socialist society—distribution according to labor is implemented, while in the advanced stage of communism, distribution according to need is implemented. At the same time, in the socialist stage, due to different economic conditions, certain principles of proletarian right also differ. For example, from legally protecting the private ownership of the means of production to eliminating private ownership, from "benefit for both labor and capital" to "four horses divide the fat," and then to the fixed interest policy, these all correctly reflect the objective economic and political conditions at the time, conform to the interests of the proletariat and communism, and therefore they are the embodiment of the proletarian will and a component of proletarian right.
    The Remnants of Bourgeois Right Retained in Proletarian Right Are the Embodiment of the Proletarian Will
    Communism is an unprecedentedly great and arduous cause, and the road to communism must be taken step by step, not achieved overnight. Proletarian right, like any other right, cannot transcend the socio-economic system and the level of social and cultural development determined by this economic system. Therefore, in the socialist stage and even in the early stages of communism, due to the limitations of objective economic and political conditions, factual inequalities among people are inevitable, and the existence of remnants of bourgeois right is inevitable. Marxists have high revolutionary enthusiasm and, at the same time, a high degree of realistic and scientific spirit. They handle any problem based on objective economic and political conditions. If one only relies on enthusiasm and disregards objective economic conditions, announcing the abolition of the remnants of bourgeois right with an order, it may seem very revolutionary, but in reality, it is detrimental to the proletariat and hinders the revolution. For example, in terms of the principle of distribution, if distribution according to need is implemented immediately, it will inevitably lead to the egalitarianism of the petty bourgeoisie, hindering the development of the social economy and the early realization of communism. The principle of distribution according to labor, from a formal point of view, seems to be a concession to bourgeois right, and the revolution is not so thorough, but in reality, it is the most revolutionary and most in line with the interests of the proletariat in the current period. Because it fits the current socio-economic and political conditions, it is easy to oppose capitalist exploitation, consolidate labor discipline, and encourage people's labor enthusiasm, and therefore it is most unfavorable to the bourgeoisie and capitalism and most favorable to the proletariat and communism. From this, it can be seen that, due to the needs of objective economic conditions, the remnants of bourgeois right retained in proletarian right are consciously utilized by the proletariat to serve the cause of socialism and communism, are the embodiment of the proletarian will, are proletarian right, and not bourgeois right.
    Remnants of Bourgeois Right and Bourgeois Right Only Have Formal Identity but Have Fundamental Differences in Essence
    Marxist classic writers have always treated the remnants of bourgeois right with a dialectical materialist viewpoint, seeing both their identity with bourgeois right and emphasizing the fundamental differences between them. They believe that distribution according to labor "is still bourgeois right in principle" because "like all rights, it is a right of inequality" and "is still limited by the scope of bourgeois right." At the same time, they also emphasized that this bourgeois-style right, "principle and practice are no longer contradictory here," indicating that the socialist principle of "he who does not work, neither shall he eat" has been realized, and "the socialist principle of receiving equal products for equal labor has also been realized." Because the "equal exchange" and factual inequality in distribution according to labor do not, like in capitalist society, seize surplus value through "equal exchange" and create the inequality of class exploitation, but rather distribute products equally according to the quantity and quality of labor through the form of equal exchange, in order to achieve the goal of opposing capitalist exploitation and consolidating socialist labor discipline. Therefore, in the main aspects, this right only has formal identity with bourgeois right, but in content and essence, it is fundamentally different. Our retention of the remnants of bourgeois right is like retaining a state without the bourgeoisie. Although the proletarian state still recognizes factual inequalities, no one can doubt that the proletarian state is socialist in nature. Another example is the fixed interest policy, which, on the surface, is to admit the partial existence of capitalist exploitation and is beneficial to the bourgeoisie, but in essence, it is to redeem the bourgeoisie through "fixed interest" in order to achieve the goal of eliminating the bourgeoisie. Therefore, it is beneficial to the proletariat and not to the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the fixed interest policy is the embodiment of the proletariat's will to eliminate the bourgeoisie, not the embodiment of the bourgeois will, and it is proletarian right and not bourgeois right. This shows that the emergence of the principle of distribution according to labor and the fixed interest policy is not because the proletariat is influenced by bourgeois right or forced by the pressure of bourgeois right, but rather because it firmly stands on the proletarian position, soberly assesses the objective economic and political conditions, recognizes that their existence is "economically and politically inevitable in a society that has just emerged from the womb of capitalism," and consciously utilizes them to serve the proletariat. Nevertheless, we still need to call them remnants of bourgeois right. On the one hand, this is to facilitate our overcoming acute diseases and concentrating our efforts on developing productive forces to accelerate socialist construction; on the other hand, it keeps us mindful and our minds constantly clear, consciously utilizing them to serve the proletariat, and utilizing them to eliminate them faster. In this way, we will not become prisoners of the remnants of bourgeois right.
    The Remnant Thoughts of Bourgeois Right in People's Minds Are Thoroughly Remnants of Bourgeois Right
    The remnants of bourgeois right exist more extensively in people's minds. This is not only the case among bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals, but also relatively common among the working people. For example, capitalists never forget fixed interest and exploitation, bourgeois intellectuals use degrees and academic titles as capital, some workers still have the concept of private ownership of labor, and the view of paying labor according to remuneration is still popular among some backward masses. These remnants of bourgeois right have a fundamental difference from the remnants of bourgeois right, such as the principle of distribution according to labor, which are embodied in proletarian right. The latter is that we consciously utilize it to serve the proletariat, which embodies the will of the proletariat; while the former is the reflection of the remnants of the capitalist superstructure in people's minds. Its existence is beneficial to the bourgeoisie. Whether from form or content, it is capitalist in nature and is a thorough remnant of bourgeois right.
    Some may think that this is a bizarre theory of playing with dialectics. In reality, this is not the case. Only by correctly distinguishing the different natures of these two kinds of remnants of bourgeois right can we correctly understand why, on the one hand, we must strengthen communist education and greatly break bourgeois right ideology, and on the other hand, we must emphasize respecting objective economic laws and recognize the inevitability of the remnants of bourgeois right, and still base distribution on the principle of distribution according to labor. These two are a unity of opposites. Whether we greatly break bourgeois right ideology or recognize the inevitability of the remnants of bourgeois right, the fundamental purpose is to promote the development of the socialist economy and create objective economic and political conditions for the complete elimination of the remnants of bourgeois right. If we confuse the two different natures, we will make a principled error. If we generally believe that the remnants of bourgeois right are all capitalist in nature, we will distort the practice of socialist revolution and distort the nature of proletarian right. If we generally deny the capitalist nature of the remnants of bourgeois right, we will deny the objective inevitability of the socialist revolution and communist education on the political and ideological front, and therefore neither is conducive to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    被利用的资产阶级法权残余才是无产阶级法权
    蔡中杰
    最近，读了侯明方同志写的“资产阶级法权残余不是资产阶级法权”一文，我同意他的一些论点，但觉得他没有把问题说清楚，因此写了这篇文章参加有关这个问题的讨论。
    法权随着经济基础的变化而变化要用历史的观点看待法权问题
    法权是上层建筑的一部分，是在一定的经济基础上产生的，体现了统治阶级的意志，为统治阶级的利益服务。资产阶级法权是在生产资料的资本家所有制基础上产生的，它为资产阶级服务。无产阶级法权则是在生产资料社会主义公有制基础上产生的，它为无产阶级服务。法权既然是上层建筑的一部分，它就会随基础的变化而变化，不但在一个社会代替另一个社会时，法权的性质要发生根本的变化，而且在同一个社会内，随着经济基础的成长，法权也在其根本性质以内发生一定的变化；这种变化正好是反映了经济基础成熟的不同程度。因此，要用历史的眼光看待法权问题。例如资产阶级法权，是用形式上的自由平等来掩盖实际上的经济和社会的不平等，维护资本主义的私有制。但在不同的时期，资产阶级法权的某些原则也起了变化。在资本主义初期，由于资本主义秩序尚未确立，资产阶级就用血腥立法来强制工人到工厂劳动，以巩固资本主义的劳动纪律，对无产阶级连形式上的平等也谈不到。以后，随着资本主义秩序的确立，资产阶级国会才颁布了工厂法，以便在自由平等的幌子下欺骗工人阶级，榨取更多的剩余价值。而随着资本主义总危机的到来，资产阶级就把民主、自由、平等的旗帜收敛起来，对工人阶级和各阶层人民公开地实行法西斯专政。虽然有这些变化，但万变不离其宗，资产阶级法权丝毫也没有离开它为资本主义经济基础服务的根本性质，仍然是资产阶级意志的体现。
    无产阶级的意志是实现共产主义，一切为了共产主义，就是无产阶级的法权。但共产主义社会是逐步成熟的，不可能一下子就建立起来。在服从于共产主义这个总的原则下，无产阶级法权在各个时期的具体表现形式也不同。如在分配制度方面，在共产主义的第一阶段——社会主义社会中，实行按劳分配，而在共产主义的高级阶段，则实行按需分配。同时在社会主义阶段，由于经济条件的不同，无产阶级法权的某些原则也有所不同。如从依法保护生产资料的私有制到消灭私有制，从“劳资两利”到“四马分肥”，又到定息政策，这些都正确地反映了当时的客观经济政治条件，符合于无产阶级和共产主义的利益，因而它们是无产阶级意志的体现，是无产阶级法权的组成部分。
    在无产阶级法权中保留的资产阶级法权残余，是无产阶级意志的体现共产主义是空前伟大艰巨的事业，通向共产主义的路总得一步一步地走，不能一蹴而就。无产阶级法权和其他任何法权一样，不能超越社会经济制度，以及由此经济制度所决定的社会文化发展程度。因此，在社会主义阶段以至共产主义初期，由于客观经济政治条件的限制，人们之间事实上的不平等是不可避免的，资产阶级法权残余的存在是不可避免的。马克思主义者有高度的革命热情，同时也有高度的实事求是的科学精神，处理任何问题都以客观经济政治条件为依据。如果只凭热情，不顾客观经济条件，一个命令就宣布废除资产阶级法权残余，这看来好像很革命，实际上是不利于无产阶级，有碍于革命的。如，在分配原则上，如果立即实行按需分配，就必然导致小资产阶级的平均主义，阻碍社会经济的发展和共产主义的早日实现。而实行按劳分配的原则，从形式上看，好像是对资产阶级法权的让步，革命不那么彻底，实际上在目前时期它是最革命的，最符合于无产阶级利益的。因为它切合当前社会的经济政治条件，便于反对资本主义剥削，巩固劳动纪律，鼓励人们的劳动情绪，因而它最不利于资产阶级和资本主义，最有利于无产阶级和共产主义。由此可见，由于客观经济条件的需要，在无产阶级法权中保留的资产阶级法权残余，是无产阶级自觉地利用它来为社会主义和共产主义事业服务的，是无产阶级意志的体现，是无产阶级法权，而不是资产阶级法权。
    资产阶级法权残余同资产阶级法权只有形式上的同一性却有实质上的根本差别
    马克思主义经典作家们，从来都是用辩证唯物主义的观点对待资产阶级法权残余，一方面看到它与资产阶级法权的同一性，另一方面又着重地看到它们之间的根本差别。他们认为按劳分配“在原则上仍然是资产阶级法权”，因为“它像一切权利一样是一种不平等的权利”，“仍然受资产阶级范围的限制”。同时他们又着重指出，这种资产阶级式的法权，“原则和实践在这里已不再互相矛盾”，说明“不劳动者不得食”这个社会主义原则已经实现了，“按等量劳动领取等量产品这个社会主义原则也已经实现了”。因为按劳分配中的“等价交换”和事实上的不平等，不是像资本主义社会那样通过“等价交换”夺取剩余价值，造成阶级剥削的不平等，而是通过等价交换的形式，平等地按劳动的数量和质量分配产品，达到反对资本主义剥削、巩固社会主义劳动纪律的目的。因此就主要方面来说，这种法权同资产阶级法权只有形式上的同一性，而在内容上、实质上则根本不同。我们保留资产阶级法权残余，就像保留没有资产阶级的国家一样，虽然无产阶级国家仍然承认事实上的不平等，但没有人能丝毫怀疑无产阶级国家是社会主义性质的。又如定息政策，从表面上看是承认资本主义剥削的部分存在，有利于资产阶级，但从实质上看却是通过“定息”赎买资产阶级，达到消灭资产阶级的目的，因而它有利于无产阶级，而不利于资产阶级。因此，定息政策是无产阶级要消灭资产阶级的意志的体现，而不是资产阶级意志的体现，是无产阶级法权而不是资产阶级法权。这就说明，按劳分配原则和定息政策的产生，不是无产阶级受了资产阶级法权的影响，或者迫于资产阶级法权的压力，而是坚定地站在无产阶级立场上，清醒地估计了客观的经济政治条件，认识到它们的存在是“刚从资本主义腹内脱胎出来的社会里在经济上和政治上不可避免的东西”，自觉地利用它们为无产阶级服务。虽然如此，我们仍有必要把它们称为资产阶级法权残余，这一方面是便于我们克服急性病，集中力量发展生产力，以加速社会主义建设；另一方面使我们心中有数，头脑经常处于清醒状态，自觉地利用它们为无产阶级服务，而利用它们是为了更快地消灭它们。这样，我们就不致于作了资产阶级法权残余的俘虏。
    人们头脑中的资产阶级法权残余思想，是十足的资产阶级法权残余
    资产阶级法权残余更大量地存在于人们的头脑中，不仅在资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子中是这样，就是在劳动人民中这种情况也比较普遍。如资本家念念不忘定息和剥削，资产阶级知识分子以学位学衔为资本，有些劳动者还有劳动私有的观念，一些落后群众中还流行着按酬付劳的观点。这些资产阶级法权残余，同体现在无产阶级法权中的按劳分配原则等资产阶级法权残余有原则的区别，后者是我们自觉地利用它来为无产阶级服务，体现了无产阶级的意志；而前者则是资本主义上层建筑的残余在人们头脑中的反映，它的存在有利于资产阶级，无论从形式和内容上看都是资本主义性质的，是十足的资产阶级法权残余。
    有人或许会认为这是玩弄辩证法把戏的奇谈怪论。实际并不如此。只有正确地区分这两种资产阶级法权残余的不同性质，才能正确地理解当前为什么一方面要加强共产主义教育，大破资产阶级法权思想；另一方面又强调要尊重客观经济规律，承认资产阶级法权残余的不可避免性，在分配上仍然以按劳分配原则为基础。这二者是矛盾的统一，不管大破资产阶级法权残余思想也好，承认资产阶级法权残余的不可避免性也好，根本目的都是促进社会主义经济的发展，为彻底消灭资产阶级法权残余创造客观的经济条件和政治条件。如果把两种不同性质的东西混同起来，就会犯原则的错误。一概认为资产阶级法权残余都是资本主义性质的，就会歪曲社会主义革命的实践，歪曲无产阶级法权的性质。一概否认资产阶级法权残余的资本主义性质，就会否认政治思想战线上社会主义革命和共产主义教育的客观必然性，因而都不利于无产阶级革命事业。
