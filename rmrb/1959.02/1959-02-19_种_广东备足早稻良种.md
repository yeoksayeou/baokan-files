Guangdong Prepares Sufficient Early Rice Seed

(By our reporter) Guangdong Province has been early and effective in selecting, managing, and allocating early rice seeds this year. Currently, all the seeds needed for early rice have been prepared.

In the Shantou, Gaoyao, and Foshan Special Districts, the quantity of seeds retained is as high as 150 jin per mu in the areas retaining the most, and generally above 50 jin per mu. Areas with insufficient seed retention have also been promptly resolved through mutual exchange and adjustment within the county or special district.

The carefully selected rice seeds are mostly high-purity, high-quality local varieties that have been cultivated, possessing characteristics such as many grains, heavy grains, fertilizer tolerance, and strong lodging resistance. Furthermore, they have the advantages of being able to adapt to conditions of dense planting, sufficient fertilizer, and deep plowing.

Since October of last year, various parts of Guangdong have dispatched large numbers of cadres to go deep into the grassroots, earnestly inspecting the storage, preservation, and evaluation of self-retained good seeds. Communes in various places have established good seed breeding farms and seed retention fields, and formed seed specialist teams, selecting ninety-eight excellent early rice varieties, which greatly meets the need for replacing good seeds this year. In addition, various places began holding seed storage training classes in the first half of last year, universally establishing seed warehouses, ensuring dedicated personnel for storage, and carrying out seed ventilation, turning, drying, and disinfection, thereby greatly reducing seed losses, eliminating diseases and pests, and significantly improving the quality of early rice seeds this year.

Communes are carrying out crash programs to accumulate fertilizer and deliver manure, preparing "food" for the grain marshal. Yu Min (Heilongjiang Daily contribution)

    广东备足早稻良种
    本报讯　广东省今年早稻良种的选择、管理和调拨工作抓得早，抓得好，目前早稻所需种子已全部备妥。
    汕头、高要、佛山等专区留种数量最高的每亩达一百五十斤，一般的也有五十斤以上。留种不足的地区，经过县内或专区内互相串换调剂，也及时得到了解决。
    精选出来的稻种，大部分是经过培育的纯度高的优良农家种，具有粒多、粒重、耐肥、抗倒伏力强等特性，而且有能适应密植、足肥、深翻条件等优点。
    广东各地从去年10月开始就抽调大批干部深入基层，切实检查自留良种的贮备、保管和评选等工作。各地公社都建立了良种繁育场、留种田，建立了种籽专业队，评选出九十八个优良早稻种，在很大程度上满足了今年更换良种的需要。此外，各地在去年上半年就开始举办种子保管训练班，普遍建立种子仓，做到专人保管，并且进行了种子通风、翻晒、消毒等工作，因而大大减少了种子的损失，杜绝了病虫害，使今年早稻种子质量比过去有显著提高。（附图片）
