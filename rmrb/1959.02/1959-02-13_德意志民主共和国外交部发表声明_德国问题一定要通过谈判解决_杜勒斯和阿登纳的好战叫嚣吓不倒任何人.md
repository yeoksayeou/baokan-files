Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 12th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on February 11th regarding US Secretary of State Dulles' "lightning" trip to Western Europe, condemning Dulles for issuing the cry, at Adenauer's suggestion, that he would rather risk war than give up West Berlin.

The statement said that in order to justify this unheard-of statement, they had made extremely crude distortions of the views and proposals of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union.

The statement pointed out that the purpose of the proposals put forward by the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union was to ease tensions in Europe and maintain European peace by clarifying the issue of West Berlin and concluding a peace treaty with the two Germanies through peaceful means.

The statement said that the proposal regarding the status of West Berlin as a demilitarized free city, and the request for the United Nations to guarantee this status if necessary, is the basis for a negotiated solution to all issues related to West Berlin.

The statement said that the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union's willingness to negotiate has been praised by influential politicians, Western international law experts, and the general public.

The statement said that the German people, the people of all countries who participated in the war against Hitler's Germany, and the general public are increasingly urgently raising the question: What specific proposals will Bonn and Washington put forward regarding the conclusion of a German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue? When will Dulles and his obedient partners stop threatening with tank convoys and put forward real proposals that can be discussed at peace conferences and other meetings?

The statement emphasized that Adenauer and Dulles' threats only demonstrate the fact that their negative attitude towards the peace conference and their stubborn clinging to the West German occupation regime are untenable under international law. They want to panic the peace-loving people and use military boasting to cover up their own political weakness, but they can no longer dispel the people's demand for negotiations and a peaceful understanding on issues concerning all of Germany. Their war-mongering cannot intimidate anyone. On the contrary, they can no longer withstand the pressure of the peace-loving masses.

The statement concluded that at present, the world's people's desire for peace shows that the urgent task of concluding a German peace treaty and resolving the West Berlin issue despite sabotage will certainly be completed. The German Democratic Republic will spare no effort to resolve all issues related to these problems with the countries concerned through peaceful means.

    德意志民主共和国外交部发表声明
    德国问题一定要通过谈判解决
    杜勒斯和阿登纳的好战叫嚣吓不倒任何人
    新华社柏林12日电　德意志民主共和国外交部11日就美国国务卿杜勒斯在西欧的“闪电”旅行发表声明，谴责在阿登纳的建议下，杜勒斯发出的宁可冒战争的危险也不愿放弃西柏林的叫嚷。
    声明说，为了为这种闻所未闻的声明找借口，他们对德意志民主共和国和苏联的观点和建议进行了极为粗暴的歪曲。
    声明指出，德意志民主共和国和苏联所提出的建议的目的是为了通过和平的途径来澄清西柏林的问题和同两个德国缔结和约来达到缓和欧洲的紧张局势和保持欧洲和平。
    声明说，关于西柏林非军事化的自由城市的地位以及在必要时要求联合国来保证这种地位的建议是谈判解决一切有关西柏林问题的基础。
    声明说，德意志民主共和国和苏联的愿意谈判的态度已经得到了一些有影响的政治家、西方的国际法专家以及广大公众的赞扬。
    声明说，德国人民、曾经参加对希特勒德国作战的各国人民以及一般公众都越来越迫切地提出这样一个问题：波恩和华盛顿对于缔结对德和约和西柏林问题将提出什么样具体的建议？杜勒斯和服从他命令的伙伴什么时候会停止以坦克护送队相威胁，而提出一些能够在和会和其他会议上进行讨论的真正的建议？
    声明强调指出，阿登纳和杜勒斯的威胁只是表明了这样一个事实：他们对和会所采取的消极态度和顽固地死抱住西德占领政权不放的做法根据国际法是站不住脚的。他们想使和平的人民感到恐慌，以军事吹嘘的外衣来掩饰他们自己在政治上的弱点，但是他们再也不能打消人民主张就有关全德的问题进行谈判和达成和平谅解的要求。他们的好战叫嚣吓不倒任何人。相反，他们再也抵挡不住爱好和平的群众的压力。
    声明最后说，目前，全世界人民希望和平的意志表明，缔结对德和约、不顾破坏活动而解决西柏林问题这一迫切任务一定会完成。德意志民主共和国将不遗余力地同有关各国，通过和平方法解决所有同这些问题相关的问题。
