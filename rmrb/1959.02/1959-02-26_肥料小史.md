    A Brief History of Fertilizers
    Yang Min
    The use of fertilizers in our country was prevalent as early as the Zhou Dynasty, more than two thousand years ago. At that time, the main fertilizers were human and animal excrement. The book "Zhou Li" mentions: reddish-yellow hard soil uses cattle manure, light red soil uses sheep manure, soil that disperses quickly uses elk manure, sticky soil uses pig manure, and saline soil uses badger manure... From this, it can be seen that the manure fertilizers used in the Zhou Dynasty were diverse, and there was already a budding knowledge of fertilization according to local conditions. The "Book of Rites: The Monthly Commands" states, "In the last month of summer, it is good to kill weeds, fertilize the fields, and improve the soil." This was the beginning of using green manure, but it was limited to using naturally growing weeds. However, it was remarkable that the two effects of green manure on fertilizing the fields and improving the soil could be seen at this time.
    By the Han Dynasty, bone meal, urine, and silkworm pupae juice were used. Further research was conducted on the manufacture and combination of fertilizers. This is described in detail in the book of Fan Shengzhi.
    The use of compost was first seen in Jia Sixie's "Qi Min Yao Shu" in the Later Wei Dynasty. The method used was almost exactly the same as it is now. Green manure was further utilized with cultivated crops such as mung beans, adzuki beans, and sesame. It was also discovered that legume crops are the best kind of green manure, and that green manure can maintain the original fertility of the field and prevent loss.
    After the Song and Yuan dynasties, commercial fertilizers such as sesame cake and rapeseed cake, and lime as an indirect fertilizer, were used successively. The technique of using fermentation to promote the decomposition and maturation of oilseed cakes was already perfect. In addition, sludge, moss, and clam ash were also widely collected and utilized. Even the leftover rice bran, rice husks, vegetable scraps, and wastewater from washing clothes and miscellaneous items were not easily discarded by families. Farming households mostly had deep ponds next to the toilet and kitchen to store these wastes, which were used after they were fully decomposed. At this time, people had already divided fertilizers into many types, such as grass manure, fire manure, and mud manure. There were methods such as trampling manure, steaming manure, brewing manure, and boiling manure for fertilizer manufacturing. In the application of fertilizers, there were concepts such as "relay" and "bottoming".
    Facts have proved that the fertilizers used in ancient China, whether in terms of fertilizer efficiency, manufacturing methods, or application methods, were mostly in line with scientific principles. However, there are also some interesting and useful examples whose secrets have not been fully revealed:
    For example, the book "Qi Min Yao Shu" says that using "broken walls" to fertilize vegetables has a very good effect. "Broken walls" are old wall soil, which is abundant in rural areas of our country. With the construction of new houses, these old walls can be used in large quantities. But why does it have a significant fertilizer effect? Some people believe that it may be because the old wall soil has been idle for a long time, and it contains a large number of non-symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, blue-green algae, and nitrifying bacteria. Like symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, non-symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria and blue-green algae can also fix nitrogen in the air and turn it into nitrogen compounds. Nitrifying bacteria can accumulate nitrates in the wall soil. Both products are good nitrogen fertilizers, and after the wall soil is applied, nitrogen-fixing bacteria, blue-green algae, and nitrifying bacteria can continue to produce fertilizer in the soil.
    In addition, Xu Guangqi's "Nong Zheng Quan Shu" of the Ming Dynasty has records of using animal materials such as feathers and hair as fertilizers. Nowadays, some people who grow flowers also like to add some hair to the potting soil. This mainly utilizes an amino acid formed when hair decomposes. This acid is not only a very valuable medicine, but also promotes plant growth. However, animal materials such as hair are difficult to decompose. "Nong Zheng Quan Shu" says: "Feathers and hair will decay after being accumulated in hot water for a long time. If you want to quickly decompose them, put a handful of chives in it, and they will be completely rotten the next day." This is also worth studying and utilizing.

    肥料小史
    杨旻
    我国使用肥料，早在二千多年前的周代，就已盛行。那时主要的肥料是人、畜的粪便。“周礼”一书中提到：红黄色的硬土用牛粪，淡红色的土用羊粪，一泡即散的土用麋粪，粘滞的土用猪粪，盐土用獾粪……从这里可以看出：周代所用粪肥是多种多样的，并且已有了因地施肥的知识的萌芽。“礼记”月令中则有“季夏之月，利以杀草，可以粪田畴，可以美土疆”。这就是利用绿肥的开始，不过只限于利用自然生长的野草，但这时竟能看出绿肥的肥田（粪田畴）和改良土壤（美土疆）的两种功效，实在是难得的。
    到了汉代，便用到了骨肥、小便和缫蛹汁等。对于肥料的制造和配合有了进一步的研究。这在汜胜之书中记载很详。
    堆肥的利用，最早见于后魏贾思勰的“齐民要术”一书，所用的方法和现在的几乎完全一样。绿肥则进一步利用到了绿豆、小豆、胡麻等栽培作物。并且还发现了豆类作物是绿肥中的上品，以及绿肥能保持田中原有肥分、防止流失的作用。
    宋元以后，麻枯、菜枯等商品肥料和作为间接肥料的石灰，都先后被利用起来。用醱酵法促使枯粕分解腐熟的技术，已很完美。此外，污泥、苔草和蚌蛤灰等，也广泛被搜集利用。甚至于家庭日用所遗下的磨糠、谷壳、蔬菜的残根碎叶、洗涤衣服杂物的余水等，人们也不肯轻易放过。农圃之家，大多都在厕旁厨下设有深池，储藏这些废物，待充分腐熟后应用。这时人们对于肥料，已将它分为草粪、火粪、泥粪等许多种类。对于肥料的制造，则有踏粪法、蒸粪法、酿粪法、煮粪法……之分。在肥料的施用上，有所谓“接力”和“垫底”等概念。
    事实证明：我国古代所用的肥料，无论是肥效或制法、施法，大部分是合乎科学道理的。然而也有一些有趣而有用的事例，秘密还没有完全揭穿：
    例如：“齐民要术”一书说用“坏墙垣”施于蔬菜，肥效很佳。“坏墙垣”就是陈旧的墙土，我国农村很多，随着新住宅的兴建，这旧的墙垣就可以大量利用。不过为什么它有显著的肥效呢？有人认为：可能是由于旧墙土长期休闲，里面生有大量非共生性固氮菌、蓝绿藻和硝化细菌的原故。和共生性固氮菌一样，非共生性固氮菌、蓝绿藻也能固定空气中的氮气，使它成为氮化物。硝化细菌则能在墙土中积聚硝酸盐。这两种产物都是很好的氮肥，并且墙土施用以后，固氮菌、蓝绿藻和硝化菌还可以在土壤中继续造肥。
    此外，明徐光启的“农政全书”，有利用羽毛、头发等动物质作肥料的记载。现在有些养花的人也往往喜欢在盆壤中加进一些毛发之类的东西。这主要是利用毛发在腐烂时所形成的一种氨基酸。这种酸不仅是一种非常贵重的医药，而且还能促进植物生长。不过毛发等动物质很难腐烂，农政全书说：“毛羽和燖汤积之久，则溃腐，如欲速溃，置韭菜一握其中，明日烂尽矣。”这也是值得研究利用的。
