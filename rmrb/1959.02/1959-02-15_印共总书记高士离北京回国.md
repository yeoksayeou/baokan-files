Xinhua News Agency, February 14th – CPI General Secretary Ghosh left Beijing by plane on February 14th to return home via Moscow after a five-day visit in Beijing.

Those who went to the airport to see him off included Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Liu Ningyi, Wu Xiuquan, members of the Central Committee, and Li Qixin, a responsible staff member of the organs of the CPC Central Committee, and others.

Comrade Ghosh issued a written statement at Beijing Airport, saying: "My stay in Beijing was too short - only five days. But what I saw will remain in my mind forever. I saw a great nation throbbing with new life and full of vitality, rushing towards one goal like one person - building a socialist China. Their enthusiasm is earth-shattering, and they have boundless confidence in themselves, in the destiny of their great country, and in the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong. Changes that usually take years or even decades are completed in days and months.

"I simply cannot describe how happy and honored I was when I met with Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Liu Shaoqi and listened to them talk about the grand plan for socialist construction in China.

"On behalf of our party, the working masses of our country, and the people of our country, and in my own name, I thank and salute all the friends and comrades I have met during these short days, and through them I thank and salute the Communist Party of China and the entire Chinese people. I am convinced that the friendly ties between the people of our two countries will be increasingly consolidated in the future and will become a powerful factor for peace in Asia and the world."

On the afternoon of the 15th, Comrade Ghosh, accompanied by Li Qixin, visited Tsinghua University. Jiang Nanxiang, President of Tsinghua University, and Liu Xianzhu, Vice President, warmly received Comrade Ghosh, introduced the development of the university to Comrade Ghosh, and led him to visit various teaching and production facilities of the university. Comrade Ghosh also met with a large number of students and was warmly welcomed.

After the visit, Comrade Ghosh said that the visit was not only very pleasant for him, but also a real education. He congratulated the teachers and students of the university on their achievements, and expressed his firm belief that the teachers and students, under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party headed by the great Chairman Mao, will play a huge role in China's socialist construction.

On the morning of the 13th, Comrade Ghosh also visited Rong Bao Zhai and the Temple of Heaven. (Attached picture)

    印共总书记高士离北京回国
    新华社14日讯　印度共产党总书记高士同志在北京参观了五天后，已于14日乘飞机离开北京，取道莫斯科回国。
    前往机场欢送的，有中国共产党中央委员会副主席刘少奇，中央委员刘宁一、伍修权，中共中央机关负责工作人员李启新等人。
    高士同志在北京机场发表书面谈话说：“我在北京逗留的时间太短了——只有五天。但是我所看到的景象将永远留在我脑中。我看到一个跳动着新生命和充满着活力的伟大民族像一个人一样地奔赴一个目标——建设社会主义的中国。他们的热情惊天动地，他们对于自己、对于他们伟大国家的命运、对于以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党领导怀有无限的信心。通常需要若干年甚至数十年的变革在几天和几个月的时间里就完成了。
      “我简直无法形容当我会见了毛泽东同志和刘少奇同志，并且听他们谈到中国进行社会主义建设的宏伟计划时，我感到多么高兴和荣幸。
      “我代表我们党、我国劳动群众和我国人民并以我个人的名义，向我在这些短暂的时日里遇见的所有朋友和同志道谢并致意，并通过他们向中国共产党和全体中国人民道谢并致意。我确信我们两国人民之间的友谊联系今后将日益巩固，并将成为亚洲和世界和平的一个有力的因素。”
    在15日下午，高士同志由李启新陪同参观了清华大学。清华大学校长蒋南翔和副校长刘仙洲热情地接待了高士同志，向高士同志介绍了该校发展情况，并带领参观了该校各种教学和生产设备。高士同志还会见了广大学生，受到热烈欢迎。
  高士同志在参观后说，这次参观不仅使他很愉快，而且也是一次真正的教育。他祝贺该校教师和学生取得成就，并表示深信师生们在以伟大的毛主席为首的光荣的中国共产党领导下，在中国的社会主义建设中将发挥巨大的作用。
    在13日上午，高士同志还参观了荣宝斋，游览了天坛。（附图片）
