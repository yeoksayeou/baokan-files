Xinhua News Agency, February 7th – Xie Juezai, Minister of Internal Affairs, delivered a radio address on Central People's Broadcasting Station today, extending Spring Festival greetings to all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, families of martyrs nationwide, families of military personnel, disabled soldiers, demobilized and transferred soldiers, and retired soldiers. The full text of the radio address is as follows:
    Dear comrades of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army! Dear comrades of the families of martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled soldiers, demobilized and transferred soldiers, and retired soldiers!

    As the people of the whole country joyously celebrate the 1959 Spring Festival, I extend my cordial greetings and highest respect to you on behalf of the government and the people!

    1958 was an extremely extraordinary year. In this year, China's industry and agriculture, especially the production of steel and grain, achieved leaping growth. The people's enthusiasm is growing stronger and stronger, and their wisdom and strength are also growing stronger and stronger. The vast rural areas have been communized, education has developed unprecedentedly, the socialist and communist consciousness of the people has been greatly enhanced, and life has improved. The whole country has appeared in a new unprecedented look.

    Similarly, in the past year, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become stronger and its unity more consolidated. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, the general characteristic of the international situation is that "the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day."

    The people of the whole world are very happy to see these achievements. You who stand at the forefront of the struggle for these causes - the soldiers in service, the soldiers demobilized and transferred to other work posts, the soldiers wounded in the war, the families of martyrs and military personnel who contributed their loved ones to the revolutionary war - are even happier. You have contributed great strength to the great socialist construction. The long revolutionary war is blossoming brilliantly and bearing abundant fruits. How can you not be doubly happy!

    Dear comrades of the People's Liberation Army, in this year, you have also been making leaps in combat and military training. Your strength has been slightly tested in the Taiwan Strait area, and you are able to defeat any imperialist provocations. You are not only soldiers, but also farmers and workers. In the past year, according to incomplete statistics, you have performed more than 59 million voluntary labor days, helping various localities to build more than 20,000 large and small water conservancy projects. You have also made great contributions in supporting steel production, transportation, and various basic construction projects. You are a strong fighting force, and also a strong production force and working force.

    Dear comrades of the families of martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled soldiers, demobilized and transferred soldiers! In the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, you carried forward the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army and demonstrated a high degree of initiative and creativity, making great contributions on various production fronts. According to statistics from thirteen regions including Beijing, Shanghai, Shanxi, Liaoning, Shaanxi, and Hunan, disabled soldiers and demobilized soldiers alone have successfully trial-produced 845,436 new products of various kinds. During the period of large-scale steel production in Shanxi Province, families of martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers quickly established more than 300 various types of iron and steel plants. In short, the achievements you have made are countless. You have strived to implement the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," and have played a vanguard and backbone role in various construction undertakings.

    The people have always respected you in the past; now that you have made even greater contributions and achieved new achievements, you have won greater glory and earned greater respect.

    Comrades! This year is a decisive year for our country's three years of hard work. In this year, our country's industrial and agricultural production and scientific, cultural, and educational undertakings will have a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has put forward to the people of the whole country the guidelines and main indicators for the development of the national economy in 1959. The national economic plan formulated according to these guidelines and indicators will be a grand leap forward plan. The realization of this plan will greatly advance our country's socialist construction, and to realize this plan requires the common struggle of the people of the whole country, and even more your greater efforts.

    Comrades of all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army! The people of the motherland hope that you will make even greater leaps forward in this regard, continue to strengthen military training, strive to study Chairman Mao's military thinking, further improve your military qualities and combat capabilities, firmly defend the peaceful labor of the people of the motherland in building socialism, smash all the enemy's invasion plots, and strive to liberate our country's territories of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mawei.

    Comrades of all families of martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled soldiers, demobilized and transferred soldiers, and retired soldiers! The construction undertakings of the motherland are developing rapidly with one victory after another, one leap forward after another. It is hoped that you will continue to go all out with revolutionary enthusiasm, combine revolutionary enthusiasm with a scientific spirit, and, together with the people of the whole country, play a greater, better, and more comprehensive role in the various undertakings of socialist construction and in the work of consolidating and rectifying the people's communes. It is necessary to study well the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. This is a programmatic document of historical significance, a pointer guiding our actions. It is necessary to implement the spirit of the resolution in all fields such as production, work, and life.

    Comrades, you have already achieved great achievements in production and work. The people of the whole country praise you, and you should be praised. However, it must be remembered that your achievements have all been achieved under the leadership of the Party. As the masses say well: of a thousand and ten thousand things, the Party's leadership is the first; of a thousand plans and ten thousand schemes, the mass line is the first. Without the leadership of the Party and without the support of the people, even if an individual has great abilities, he will accomplish nothing. It is hoped that you will always listen to the Party, always be with the masses, and not be the least bit proud, let alone be satisfied with today's achievements. It is necessary to be modest and prudent, advance in victory, and make even more outstanding achievements in the great cause of accelerating the building of socialism.

    I wish you a happy Spring Festival and good health.

    永远听党的话，永远和群众在一起
    内务部长谢觉哉向解放军、烈军属和残废军人祝贺春节
    新华社7日讯　内务部部长谢觉哉今天在中央人民广播电台发表广播讲话，向中国人民解放军全体官兵、全国烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人、复员转业军人和退伍军人祝贺春节。广播讲话全文如下：亲爱的中国人民解放军全体官兵同志
  们！亲爱的烈士家属、军人家属、残废军
  人、复员转业军人和退伍军人同志
  们！
    当此全国人民欢度1959年春节的时候，我代表政府和人民向你们致以亲切的慰问和崇高的敬意！
    1958年是极不平凡的一年。这一年，我国的工业农业首先是钢铁、粮食的生产有了飞跃的增长。人民的干劲越来越足，智慧与力量也越来越强。广大的农村人民公社化了，教育事业空前发展了，人民群众的社会主义、共产主义的觉悟大大提高了，生活改善了，全国出现了史无前例的新面貌。
    同样，过去的一年中，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营更加壮大，团结更加巩固。正如毛泽东同志所说的，国际形势的总的特点是，“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。
    全世界人民看到这些成就，非常高兴。站在为这些事业斗争的最前列的你们——正在服役的军人，复员转业到其他工作岗位的军人，在战争中负伤的军人，贡献出亲人为革命战争服务的烈士家属、军人家属，当更高兴。你们在伟大的社会主义建设中贡献出很大的力量，长期的革命战争正在开灿烂之花，结丰硕之果，那能不加倍地高兴！
    亲爱的解放军同志们，在这一年中，你们在战斗和军事训练当中也是跃进的。你们的力量在台湾海峡地区已经小试其锋，你们能够击败任何帝国主义的挑衅。你们不仅是兵士，而且是农民，是工人。过去的一年中，据不完全的统计，你们作了五千九百多万个义务劳动日，帮助各地修建了大小水利工程两万多项。在支援钢铁生产、交通运输和各项基本建设等方面也作出了巨大的贡献。你们是强大的战斗队，也是强大的生产队和工作队。
    亲爱的烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人和复员转业军人同志们！1958年的工农业生产大跃进中，你们发扬了人民解放军的光荣传统，表现了高度的积极性和创造精神，在各个生产战线上作出了巨大的贡献。据北京、上海、山西、辽宁、陕西、湖南等十三个地区的统计，仅残废军人和复员军人试制成功的各种新产品就有八十四万五千四百三十六件。山西省的烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人和复员军人，在大办钢铁期间，很快的办起了各种各样的炼铁厂和炼钢厂三百多所。总之，你们作出的成绩是数不尽的。你们努力贯彻执行了党的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，在各项建设事业中起了尖兵作用和骨干作用。
    人民，过去就尊敬你们；现在，你们又作出了更大的贡献，获得了新的成就，你们就取得了更大的光荣，博得了更大的尊敬。
    同志们！今年是我国苦战三年的决定性的一年，这一年，我国工农业生产和科学文化教育事业将有更大更好更全面的跃进。党的八届六中全会向全国人民提出了1959年国民经济发展的方针和主要指标，根据这些方针和指标所编制的国民经济计划，将是一个宏伟的跃进计划。这个计划的实现，将使我国的社会主义建设事业向前大大迈进一步，而要实现这个计划，需要全国人民的共同奋斗，更需要你们更大的努力。
    人民解放军的全体官兵同志们！祖国人民希望你们在这方面更大地跃进，继续加强军事训练，努力学习毛主席的军事思想，进一步提高军事素养和作战能力，坚定地保卫祖国人民建设社会主义的和平劳动，粉碎敌人的一切侵犯阴谋，并且为解放我国的领土台、澎、金、马而努力。
    全体烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人、复员转业军人和退伍军人同志们！祖国的建设事业，正在一个胜利接着一个胜利，一个跃进又一个跃进地飞速发展。希望你们继续鼓足革命干劲，要把革命热情和科学精神结合起来，同全国人民一道，在社会主义建设的各项事业中，在整顿和巩固人民公社的工作中，发挥更大更好更全面的作用。要很好地学习党的八届六中全会的决议，这是一个具有历史意义的纲领性的文件，是指导我们行动的指针，要把决议的精神贯彻到生产、工作和生活等各个领域中去。
    同志们，你们在生产和工作中已经获得了很大的成就，全国人民都赞扬你们，也应该赞扬你们。但是，必须记住，你们的成就，都是在党的领导之下取得的，群众说得好：千条万条党的领导是头一条，千计万计群众路线是第一计，没有党的领导，离开人民的支持，个人有天大的本领，也会一事无成。希望你们永远听党的话，永远和群众在一起，不能有半点骄傲，更不能满足于今天的成绩。要虚心谨慎，乘胜前进，在加速建成社会主义的伟大事业中，作出更加出色的成就。
    祝你们春节快乐，身体健康。
