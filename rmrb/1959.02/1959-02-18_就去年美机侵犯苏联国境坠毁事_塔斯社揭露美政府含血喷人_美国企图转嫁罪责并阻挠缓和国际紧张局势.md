    Xinhua News Agency, February 17th: TASS, Moscow - TASS is authorized to publish a statement on February 16th refuting the US State Department's statement on February 5th regarding the US Air Force aircraft's violation of Soviet airspace on September 2nd, 1958, and its crash in the Yerevan city area.

    The TASS statement said that, as everyone knows, the details of the US military aircraft's deliberate violation of Soviet airspace and crash in the Yerevan city area, obtained by Soviet relevant agencies after a detailed investigation, have been notified to the US side in the Soviet Foreign Ministry's notes of September 12th, 19th, and October 16th, 1958. The remains of the six pilots of the US military aircraft were also handed over to the US representatives on September 24th. The investigation also proved that the US aircraft deliberately violated Soviet airspace, penetrated deep into Soviet airspace, and crashed on Soviet territory. Therefore, the Soviet government lodged a strong protest with the US government.

    The statement said that the US government should have thanked the Soviet government for conducting the investigation and notification, and taken necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of US aircraft violating Soviet airspace, thereby eliminating one of the sources of aggravation of Soviet-US relations. However, the US government has taken a different path. The US State Department has tried its best to evade responsibility for the deaths of the personnel and has used various provocative fabrications, insisting that Soviet fighter planes intercepted the US aircraft in Turkish territory, "led" it into Soviet territory, and then shot it down. The State Department also fabricated another absurd claim, saying that the Soviets used radio direction finders to "lure" the US aircraft into Soviet territory and then destroy it. In order to find a basis for these fabrications, the US authorities did not hesitate to fabricate so-called "records" of radio conversations between Soviet pilots who shot down the US aircraft.

    The statement said that the Soviet government firmly rejects all attempts by the US government to shift the responsibility for the lives of the aircraft personnel and the loss of the aircraft to the Soviet Union. The responsibility for this incident lies entirely with the US government and with those who ordered the US aircraft to violate Soviet airspace.

    The statement emphasized that the Soviet Union believes that the fact that the US government is attempting to use the US aircraft and its personnel's crash as a pretext for instigating anti-Soviet sentiment in the United States proves that it is attempting to prevent Soviet and American people from increasing mutual understanding, improving relations between the two countries, and easing international tensions. It seems that some people in the United States are unhappy with the recent improvement in Soviet-US relations, especially due to Comrade Mikoyan's recent visit to the United States, because this improvement has strengthened the sentiment in the United States calling for improving relations between the two countries and stopping the "Cold War."

    就去年美机侵犯苏联国境坠毁事
    塔斯社揭露美政府含血喷人
    美国企图转嫁罪责并阻挠缓和国际紧张局势
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：塔斯社16日受权发表声明，驳斥美国国务院2月5日就美国空军飞机1958年9月2日侵犯苏联国境和坠落于埃里温市地区一事所发表的声明。
    塔斯社声明说，大家知道，苏联有关机构在经过详细调查后所获得的有关美国军用飞机蓄意侵犯苏联国境和坠落于埃里温市地区的详情，已经在苏联外交部1958年9月12日、19日和10月16日的照会中通知美方。美国军用飞机六个飞行员的遗骸也已在9月24日移交给美方代表。调查还证明，美国飞机蓄意侵犯苏联国境，深入苏联领空，坠落于苏联境内，因此，苏联政府向美国政府提出坚决抗议。
    声明说，美国政府本应当感谢苏联政府所进行的调查和通知，并且采取必要措施防止今后再发生美机侵犯苏联国境的事件，从而消除苏美关系尖锐化的根源之一。但是，美国政府却采取了另一条道路。美国国务院极力规避对死者家属的责任，运用了各种挑衅性的捏造，硬说苏联歼击机在土耳其境内截击美国飞机，把它“引到”苏联境内而后击落。国务院还制造了另一种荒谬的说法，说苏联人用无线电指向台“引诱”美国飞机飞入苏联国境而后击毁。为了给这些臆造找寻根据，美国当局不惜采取捏造的手法，捏造所谓击落美国飞机的苏联飞行员之间的无线电通话的“记录”。
    声明说，苏联政府坚决驳斥美国政府想把对这架飞机飞行人员的生命和飞机损失的责任推到苏联身上的一切企图。这个事件的责任完全在于美国政府，在于那些下令美国飞机侵犯苏联国境的人。
    声明强调说，苏联认为，美国政府企图利用美国飞机及其飞行人员坠毁事件来作为在美国煽动敌视苏联的运动的这一事实证明，它企图阻止苏美人民增进相互谅解，改善两国关系和缓和国际紧张局势。看来，美国国内有人对最近出现的特别是由于米高扬同志最近访美而出现的苏美关系的某种好转感到不高兴，因为这种好转使美国国内要求改善两国的关系和停止“冷战”的情绪加强了。
