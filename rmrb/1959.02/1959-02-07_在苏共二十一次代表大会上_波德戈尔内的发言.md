Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 28th: Comrade Podgorny, alternate member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU, delivered a speech at the 21st Congress of the CPSU on January 28th.

    He said that Comrade Khrushchev's report provided a Marxist-Leninist analysis and summary of the tremendous work carried out by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party. The Soviet people have entered a period of comprehensively building a communist society. The report comprehensively and clearly elaborated the profound and large-scale plan for the further vigorous growth of our economy. At the same time, it also formulated detailed political and organizational measures to ensure the smooth realization of the Seven-Year Plan. Khrushchev's report is a valuable contribution to the further development of Marxist-Leninist theory and a brilliant example of the combination of theory and practice.

    He continued that the Soviet people deeply understand the greatness of the new tasks put forward by the Party and recognize that the victorious establishment of communism in our country is their internationalist obligation and lofty responsibility to the working people of the world. During the in-depth and comprehensive discussion of the report outline at meetings of communists and working people, and at representative conferences and congresses of the Communist Parties of various republics, unprecedented enthusiasm and fervor were demonstrated. It can be said without exaggeration that the Seven-Year Plan is the people's own cause, intimately connected with them, because it reflects the people's thoughts and aspirations.

    The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of Ukraine, representing the will and aspirations of all communists and the entire people of Ukraine, fully agreed with the outline of Comrade Khrushchev's report and stated that the seven-year tasks of certain national economic departments of the republic may be completed in five or six years ahead of schedule, while the agricultural tasks can be completed in five years.

    Comrade Podgorny said that from the example of the prosperity of our republic and the whole of the Soviet Union, and from the magnificent prospects of the Seven-Year Plan, the Ukrainian people are convinced time and again that the despicable, essentially treacherous attempts by Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov to separate the Party from its Leninist general line and hinder our advance towards communism are hopeless.

    He described the development of the Ukrainian national economy in the next seven years. The total industrial output value of Ukraine will increase by 77%. The output of pig iron, steel and steel products, the mining volume of iron ore, coal and gas, and the amount of power generated will all greatly increase. Now, Ukraine has caught up with the most developed capitalist countries in Europe in terms of the output of some of the most important products, and after the completion of the Seven-Year Plan, it will leave them far behind.

    The state is faced with the task of greatly increasing sugar production. Ukraine plans to increase sugar production from 3.7 million tons to 5.3 million tons in seven years. This increase alone exceeds the total sugar production of France in 1957.

    Comrade Podgorny continued that due to the reclamation of large areas of wasteland in the country, the direction of Ukraine's agricultural development has changed somewhat. While further increasing grain production, the production of livestock products and industrial raw material crops will be developed at a higher speed. This direction is the most economically rational, and it is beneficial to the state, collective farms, and collective farmers.

    The primary task is to increase the yield per unit area of various grains in order to increase the total grain harvest of the republic to 2.1 billion poods. In this regard, maize will play a decisive role, and its sown area will be increased to 9 million to 10 million hectares, which will be no less than 50% of the total grain sown area. The sown area of ​​sugar beet and sunflower will increase by more than 600,000 hectares in seven years.

    In recent years, Ukraine has made great achievements in the development of animal husbandry. The Soviet people are striving to exceed the United States in terms of the output of livestock products per capita in the near future, and the staff of collective farmers and state farms are eager to make due contributions to this struggle. The Ukrainian people are enthusiastically striving to increase meat production per 100 hectares of agricultural land to at least 101 quintals (calculated by slaughter weight) within five years, exceeding the 1965 target stipulated in the plan—91.5 quintals. In the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, it is planned to increase meat production (calculated by slaughter weight) per 100 hectares of agricultural land to 62 quintals (while last year, meat production per 100 hectares of agricultural land was 49 quintals); to increase milk to 362 quintals (while last year it was 310 quintals). In many states of the republic—Kharkov, Nikolaev, Dnepropetrovsk, Khmelnitsky, Zaporozhye, Zhitomir, etc.—the meat production of collective farms and state farms will increase by almost onefold this year.

    He said that the Seven-Year Plan stipulates that the republic should carry out large-scale construction projects. It is enough to mention the following fact: in addition to large-scale industrial construction, 100 million square meters of housing will be built. Comrade Podgorny pointed out that the proposal in the report to transform collective farm villages into urban-style, well-equipped settlements is an important task with political significance. Ukraine will start building such settlements this year. They will become a demonstration for a larger scale of work in this area in the future.

    Comrade Podgorny said that our congress heard with great excitement and pride the conclusion made by Khrushchev in his report: Socialism in our country has not only achieved a complete victory, but also a thorough victory. Undoubtedly, the whole party and the entire Soviet people will also welcome this conclusion with the same feeling. Under the circumstances of the great achievements and magnificent prospects in our country, the harmful activities of the Yugoslav revisionists are even more disgusting. They are trying in vain to lead the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of various countries away from the path of Marxism-Leninism. Our party will always carry out a ruthless struggle against those who deviate from Marxist-Leninist doctrines and those who attempt to revise Marxist-Leninist doctrines.

    Podgorny said that the Ukrainian communists, who are loyal to the ideas of the great Lenin, believe that their task is to further strengthen the alliance of workers and peasants and consolidate the friendship of all nationalities, and to develop the lofty feelings of Soviet patriotism and proletarian internationalism of the Ukrainian people.

    Comrade Podgorny, on behalf of 1.28 million communists in Ukraine and on behalf of all the Ukrainian people, assured the 21st Congress of the CPSU that the lofty guarantee put forward by the working people of the Ukrainian Republic will be gloriously realized.

    在苏共二十一次代表大会上
    波德戈尔内的发言
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社莫斯科1月28日讯：苏共中央主席团候补委员波德戈尔内同志1月28日在苏共第二十一次代表大会上发了言。
    他说，赫鲁晓夫同志的报告对苏联人民在共产党领导下所进行的巨大工作做了马克思列宁主义的分析和总结。苏联人民进入了全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期。报告中极其全面和清楚地阐述了内容深刻、规模宏大的我国经济进一步蓬勃高涨的计划。与此同时，还详细地拟定了政治措施和组织措施，以保证七年计划的顺利实现。赫鲁晓夫的报告是对进一步发展马克思列宁主义理论的宝贵贡献，是理论和实际相结合的光辉榜样。
    他接着说，苏联人民深刻地理解党所提出的新任务的伟大，认识到在我国胜利地建立起共产主义是自己对全世界劳动人民的国际主义义务和崇高责任。在共产党员和劳动人民的会议上，在各加盟共和国共产党代表会议和代表大会上深入而全面地讨论报告提纲时，人们表现出空前未有的积极性和热情。可以毫不夸张地说，七年计划是人民切身的、血肉相关的事业，因为它反映了人民的思想和愿望。
    乌克兰共产党第二十次代表大会代表全体共产党员和乌克兰全体人民的意志和愿望，完全赞同赫鲁晓夫同志的报告提纲，并且表示，共和国某些国民经济部门的七年任务可能提前在五、六年内完成，而农业方面的任务则可以在五年内完成。
    波德戈尔内同志说，从我们共和国和全苏联繁荣兴盛的实例中，从七年计划的宏伟前景中，乌克兰人民一次又一次地确信，马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫想要使党脱离它的列宁主义总路线、阻挠我们向共产主义前进的卑鄙的、实质上是叛变的企图是毫无希望的。
    他叙述了今后七年内乌克兰国民经济的发展。乌克兰工业总产值将增长77％。生铁、钢和钢材的产量，铁矿砂、煤炭和瓦斯的开采量，以及发电量都将大大增加。现在，乌克兰在某些最重要的产品产量方面已经赶上了欧洲最发达的资本主义国家，而在完成七年计划以后，将把它们远远地抛在后面。
    国家面临着大大增加糖产量的任务，乌克兰在七年内计划把糖产量从三百七十万吨提高到五百三十万吨。单单这个增长量就超过了1957年法国的全部糖产量。
    波德戈尔内同志接着说，由于国内开垦大片荒地，乌克兰发展农业的方针有些改变。在进一步增加谷物产量的同时，将更加高速度地发展畜产品和工业原料作物的生产。这样的方针在经济上是最合理的，它有利于国家、集体农庄和集体农民。
    首要的任务是提高各种谷物的单位面积产量，以便把共和国的谷物总收获量提高到二十一亿普特。在这方面，玉蜀黍将起决定性的作用，它的播种面积将增加到九百万到一千万公顷，将不少于谷物总播种面积的50％。七年内甜菜和向日葵的播种面积将增加六十多万公顷。
    最近几年来，乌克兰在发展畜牧业方面取得了很大成就。苏联人民争取在最近几年内在按人口平均计算的畜产品产量方面超过美国，集体农民和国营农场的工作人员渴望对这个斗争作出应有的贡献。乌克兰人民热烈争取在五年内使每一百公顷农业用地的肉类产量至少提高到一百零一公担（按屠宰重计算），超过计划所规定的1965年的指标——九十一点五公担。在七年计划的第一年就计划把每一百公顷农业用地的肉类产量（按屠宰重计算）提高到六十二公担（而去年每一百公顷农业用地的肉类产量是四十九公担）；把奶类提高到三百六十二公担（而去年是三百一十公担）。共和国的很多州——哈尔科夫、尼古拉耶夫、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克、赫米尔尼茨基、萨坡罗什、什托密尔等州集体农庄和国营农场的肉类产量今年就将要增加差不多一倍。
    他说，七年计划规定共和国要进行大规模的建设工程。只要提一提下面的事实就够了：除了大规模的工业建设以外，还要建成一亿平方公尺的住宅。波德戈尔内同志指出，报告中提出把集体农庄乡村变为城市式的、设备完善的居民点，这是一个具有政治意义的重要任务。乌克兰今年就要开始建立这样的居民点。它们将成为今后更大规模展开这方面的工作的示范。
    波德戈尔内同志说，我们的代表大会怀着极其兴奋和自豪的心情听到了赫鲁晓夫在报告中所作出的结论：社会主义在我国不仅取得了完全的胜利，而且取得了彻底的胜利。无疑地，全党和全体苏联人民也将以同样的心情来欢迎这个结论。在我国取得巨大成就和展现出宏伟前景的情况下，南斯拉夫修正主义者的有害活动就显得更加令人厌恶，他们徒劳无益地企图使各国共产党和工人党离开马克思列宁主义的道路。我们党永远同那些背离马克思列宁主义学说、同那些企图修正马克思列宁主义学说的人进行无情的斗争。
    波德戈尔内说，忠于伟大列宁的思想的乌克兰共产党员认为自己的任务是：更加坚定地巩固工农联盟和巩固各族人民的友谊，发展乌克兰人民的苏维埃爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义的崇高感情。
    波德戈尔内同志代表乌克兰一百二十八万共产党员，代表全体乌克兰人民向苏共第二十一次代表大会保证，乌克兰共和国劳动人民所提出的崇高的保证，一定会光荣地实现。（附图片）
