In addition, to facilitate technological transformation in various economic sectors, it will produce 3,000 tractors, 3,000 trucks, 100 excavators, 7,400 generators, 45,500 electric motors, and more than 1,400 water pumps.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 20th. According to "People's Tribune," Stefan Jędrychowski, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, pointed out in a speech at the Party Delegates' Conference in Kielce that the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has started a new stage in the construction of communism in the Soviet Union, and has begun a new stage in the history of the competition between the socialist system and the capitalist system.

	He went on to say, "What is Poland's position in this competition? Obviously, we will not stand idly by in this great endeavor. We are also participating in this competition. In the next seven years, that is, by 1965, Poland's industrial production will increase by 80%, just like the Soviet Union's growth rate. By 1965, we will surpass Italy in terms of per capita output of the most important industrial products, catch up with and surpass the current level of France, and greatly narrow the distance with the most developed countries in Europe, such as Britain and West Germany."

	Jędrychowski added that after 1965, Poland will join the ranks of advanced European countries, and in the next five-year plan, Poland will be able to propose new and bolder plans.

    在同资本主义国家的和平竞赛中
    社会主义国家稳操胜券
    朝鲜今年谷物电煤铁等按人口产量将超过日本
    波兰七年后重要工业品按人口产量将超过意法
    新华社平壤21日电　朝鲜国家计划委员会委员长李钟玉20日在朝鲜第二届最高人民会议第五次会议上说，朝鲜完成了1959年人民经济计划以后，电力、煤炭、生铁、水泥、化学肥料等重要工业产品、捕鱼量和谷物的按人口平均计算产量将远远超过日本。
    平壤各报今天刊载了李钟玉的讲话。李钟玉说，朝鲜1959年人民经济计划规定今年要生产电力九十七亿度、煤炭一千零八十六万吨、生铁和粒铁一百十二万四千吨、钢八十八万四千吨、化学肥料七十万六千吨、水泥三百十八万五千吨、鱼类八十五万五千吨、布匹二亿公尺。
    李钟玉说，在朝鲜实行技术革命中起着决定性作用的机械工业今年也有很大发展，要为各钢铁厂生产二万多吨生产设备，其中包括六十七组压延机。另外，为了各经济部门进行技术改造，要生产拖拉机三千台、载重汽车三千辆、掘土机一百辆、发电机七千四百台、电动机四万五千五百台、抽水机一千四百多台。
    他说，完成1959年的人民经济计划，将提前二年以上在今年内全面完成第一个五年计划所规定的政治经济任务，而且一系列的重要工业产品的产量将超过原定的第一个五年计划最后一年1961年的水平。
    新华社华沙20日电　据“人民论坛报”报道：波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员英德里霍夫斯基最近在基尔兹市举行的党代表会议上的讲话中指出，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会开始了苏联共产主义建设的新阶段，开始了在社会主义体系和资本主义体系竞赛的历史上的新阶段。
    他接着说，波兰在这个竞赛中占甚么样的地位呢？显然，我们在这一巨大努力中将不会袖手旁观。我们也在参加这一竞赛。在今后七年中，即到1965年，波兰的工业生产也像苏联的增长速度一样，增加80％。到1965年，我们将在最重要的工业产品按人口平均计算的产量方面超过意大利，赶上和超过法国目前的水平，并大大缩短同欧洲最发达的国家的距离，如英国和西德。
    英德里霍夫斯基又说，1965年以后，波兰将跻身于欧洲先进国家之列，而在下一个五年计划时，波兰将能够提出新的更大胆的计划。
