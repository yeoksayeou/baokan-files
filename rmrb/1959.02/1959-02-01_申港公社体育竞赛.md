    Shengang Commune Sports Competition
    (Our dispatch) The Shengang People's Commune in Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, is making various preparations for the Spring Festival's entertainment activities. At present, production teams, factories, enterprises, schools, and other units are stepping up their practice for the Spring Festival sports competition. The young commune members fighting on the water conservancy construction site still persist in physical exercise after work. Now, more than 200 young commune members are undergoing the Level 1 Labor Defense System test. They are all determined to obtain a Level 1 Labor Defense System badge in the Spring Festival sports competition.

    After work and meals, the construction site will also hear beautiful and moving锡剧 (Xiju) opera tunes. This is the commune's cultural troupe rehearsing programs for the Spring Festival literary and artistic performance. They are preparing to perform their own creations such as "Waves," "Heaven is Not as Good as Earth," and "Offering Materials" during the Spring Festival. Among them, "Waves" won an award a few days ago in the county-wide performance.

    On the first day of the Lunar New Year, the entire commune will hold a 5,000-person group greeting. In the parade procession, there will be many literary and artistic programs with national and local characteristics, such as dragon lanterns, green lion dances, rocking flower boats, and stilts.

    The commune has also made arrangements for the lives of commune members during the Spring Festival, based on the spirit of being both lively and thrifty.

    申港公社体育竞赛
    本报讯　江苏江阴县申港人民公社正在为春节的文娱活动作各种准备。目前各生产队、工厂、企业、学校等单位，正在为春节体育竞赛而加紧练习。战斗在水利工地上的青年社员们，劳动之余仍然坚持着体育锻炼，现在已有二百多名青年社员在进行劳卫制一级测验，他们都决心要在春节体育竞赛中拿到一枚劳卫制一级证章。
    在工余饭后，工地上还会听到音韵优美动人的锡剧，这是公社文工团正在为春节文艺会演排练节目，他们准备在春节演出自己创作的“波浪”、“天上不如人间”、“献料”等剧目，其中“波浪”几天前在全县会演中曾荣获嘉奖。
    农历正月初一，全社将举行五千人的团拜，在团拜游行的行列中，将有很多富有民族和地方色彩的文艺节目，如龙灯、青狮舞、荡花船、高跷等。
    公社根据又热闹又节约的精神，对社员春节期间的生活也作了安排。
