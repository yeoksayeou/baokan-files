    Vigorously Carry Out Spring Afforestation
    Spring is the best season for afforestation. Currently, large-scale mass afforestation movements have vigorously developed in the southern provinces and the North China Plain, and other regions are also taking action. Actively make arrangements for labor and seedlings, seize the opportunity, go all out, act quickly, and redouble our efforts to set off a high tide of afforestation. Striving to complete 70% or even more of the afforestation tasks in the spring is of decisive significance for this year's greening and afforestation work.
    The Party's great ideal of turning the land into a garden and beautifying all of China has aroused extremely enthusiastic responses among the broad masses of people across the country. The realization of this great ideal will make our mountains and rivers more magnificent, and every village and town will become as beautiful as a garden, ensuring an inexhaustible supply of timber, endless mulberry and tea picking, and an abundance of fruits, so that people can live a good life of abundant grain and clothing in an environment of green shade in summer, red leaves in autumn, colorful flowers, and pleasant scenery.
    The realization of people's communes has made it entirely possible to greatly develop forestry while vigorously developing agricultural production. Afforestation is an important measure to ensure the stable and high yield of agriculture. Forests can prevent wind, sand, conserve water, and protect soil and fertilizer. It can not only promote increased grain production, but also make pasture lush and aquatic products abundant, promoting the great development of diversified economies. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party put forward a glorious task to the people's communes in the rural areas across the country: to realize a comprehensive revolution in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and to completely change the face of the entire agricultural front. Large-scale tree planting and afforestation, realizing the transformation of the land into a garden, is one of the most important aspects of this. Without large-scale afforestation, it is impossible to completely change the face of the countryside. This year's tree planting and afforestation movement should be linked to the long-term goal of turning the land into a garden and carried out in a planned manner.
    Carrying out a rapid and high-yield forest tree movement is the key to greatly improving the quality of afforestation and the amount of timber growth, and is of great importance to meeting the country's timber needs. This year's afforestation should focus on rapid and high yield, driving the overall leap forward in afforestation work. The practice of large-scale afforestation movements in recent years has proven that conscientiously implementing the six basic measures of planting the right trees in the right places, meticulous land preparation, improved varieties of strong seedlings, appropriate close planting, tending and protection, and reform of tools are the technical keys to making trees grow quickly and greatly increasing the yield per unit area. At present, we must pay special attention to the three links of seed and seedling, tending, and tool reform.
    Afforestation is a struggle for thousands of people to fight against nature and transform nature. In order to successfully complete this year's afforestation task, we must vigorously promote mass movements. This is one of the basic experiences for the continuous leap forward in afforestation work. At present, a vigorous fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing movement and intense spring plowing preparations are underway in rural areas. When arranging work in various places, in terms of labor, we must also follow the spirit of comprehensive arrangement and overall consideration, set aside a certain amount of time to carry out shock afforestation, and organize a certain number of professional teams to carry out year-round production. In this regard, many places have already created many experiences. Lianyuan County in Hunan Province is a key steel county, and the tasks of water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation are also heavy. However, due to the leadership of the secretary and comprehensive arrangements, the county once drew 80,000 people to carry out afforestation. From January 5th to the end of January, 380,000 mu of afforestation was completed, exceeding the task by 170%. The Wuhu Prefectural Committee and Administrative Office of Anhui designated January 22nd to 28th as the afforestation shock week, concentrating 200,000 to 300,000 people every day for afforestation, with a speed more than twice as fast as usual, and have now overfulfilled the task. It can be seen that as long as we boldly mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and combine hard work, practical work, and skillful work, we can achieve greater and better leap forwards on the afforestation front while achieving great leap forwards in other production work.

### 大搞春季造林

    大搞春季造林
    春天，是造林最好的季节。目前，南方各省和华北平原地区大规模的群众造林运动已蓬勃开展起来，其它地区也行动起来了。积极做好劳力和种苗的安排，抓紧时机，鼓足干劲，迅速行动，再接再厉地掀起造林高潮，争取把70％甚至更多的造林任务在春季完成，对今年绿化造林工作是有决定意义的。
    党的大地园林化，美化全中国的伟大理想，已在全国广大人民中激起极为热烈的响应。这个伟大理想的实现将使我国的山河更加壮丽，村村镇镇都将变成像花园般的美丽，做到木材用不尽、桑茶采不完、果品吃不完，使人们在绿荫护夏、红叶迎秋、万紫千红、景色宜人的环境里过着五谷丰登、丰衣足食的美好生活。
    人民公社化的实现，在大力发展农业生产的同时也极大地注意发展林业，已经是完全能够办到的事情了。造林是保证农业稳定丰收的重要措施。森林能防风、防沙、蓄水、保土和保肥。不仅能促使粮食增产，而且能使牧草肥美、渔产丰盈，促进多种经济大发展。党的八届六中全会向全国农村的人民公社提出了一个光荣的任务：实现农、林、牧、副、渔五业全线大革命，彻底改变整个农业战线的面貌。大规模地植树、造林，实现大地园林化是其中最重要的一个方面，没有大规模造林，是不能彻底改变农村面貌的。今年的植树造林运动就应该和大地园林化的远大目标连系起来，有计划地进行。
    开展林木快速丰产运动，是大大提高造林质量和木材生长量的关键，对满足国家的木材需要有十分重要的意义。今年造林应以快速丰产为中心，带动造林工作的全面跃进。近几年大规模造林运动的实践证明：认真贯彻适地适树、细致整地、良种壮苗、适当密植、抚育保护和改革工具六项基本措施，是使林木生长迅速和单位面积产量大大提高的技术关键。在当前要特别抓紧种苗、抚育和工具改革三个环节。
    造林是千千万万人民向自然开战、改造大自然的斗争，为了胜利完成今年的造林任务，必须大搞群众运动。这是造林工作不断跃进的基本经验之一。目前，农村中正在进行着轰轰烈烈的积肥、造肥运动和紧张的备耕春耕工作，各地安排工作的时候，在劳力方面，还要本着全面安排、统筹兼顾的精神，划出一定的时间进行突击造林，并组织一定数量的专业队进行常年生产。在这方面很多地方已经创造了许多经验，湖南省涟源县是钢铁重点县，水利、积肥任务也重，但是由于书记挂帅，全面安排，全县曾抽出八万人进行造林，从1月5日至1月底，已完成造林三十八万亩，超额170％完成任务。安徽芜湖地委、专署指定1月22日至28日为造林突击周，每天集中二三十万人造林，速度比平时快一倍多，现已超额完成任务。可见只要放手发动群众，依靠群众，使苦干、实干与巧干结合起来，在其他生产工作大跃进的同时，也同样能够在造林战线上取得更大更好的跃进。
