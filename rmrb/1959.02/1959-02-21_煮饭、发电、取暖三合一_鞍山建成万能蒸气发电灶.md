　　Anshan Builds a Multi-Purpose Steam Power Generating Stove
　　(Our Dispatch) The staff of the state-owned Anshan Restaurant have built a multi-purpose steam power generating stove based on the existing multi-purpose steam stove.
　　The multi-purpose steam power generating stove is a stove with a wide range of uses, including cooking, heating, and power generation. Its structure mainly consists of five parts: a steam generator tank, a coiled pipe, a steam engine, an electric motor, and an exhaust pipe. It uses ten burner eyes as a heating power source. The heat energy emitted by each burner eye of this stove, in addition to being used for cooking, frying, stir-frying, and pan-frying, is also transmitted through the coiled pipe in the furnace chamber to the steam tank, where it is heat-treated to generate steam. The steam is then transported through the exhaust pipe connected to the steam tank to different equipment that requires steam, where it generates its effect. According to statistics, the steam generated by the heat absorbed by the coiled pipe can supply all the heat needed for three cooking pots, one steamer, one shower room, five tableware disinfection boxes, five customer face towel disinfection boxes, and a ten-horsepower steam engine driving a 7.5 kilowatt electric motor.
　　The construction of this stove has greatly changed the working environment of the restaurant. The speed of cooking has increased; the use of steam instead of burning coal has eliminated unsanitary phenomena such as dust and smoke, improved working conditions, and saved a lot of money. According to statistics on coal consumption alone, 254 tons can be saved annually, and electricity costs can be reduced by 1,320 yuan per year. In addition to saving firewood and employee bathing expenses, more than 15,000 yuan can be saved annually. (Attached picture)

    煮饭、发电、取暖三合一
    鞍山建成万能蒸气发电灶
    本报讯　国营鞍山饭店的职工在万能蒸气灶的基础上，建成了万能蒸气发电灶。
    万能蒸气发电灶，是一个既能煮饭做菜，又可取暖、发电等用途广泛的炉灶。它的结构主要是由蒸气发生罐、盘环管、蒸气机、电动机和排气管五大部分组成，由十个炉眼作发热动力。这个灶的每个炉眼发出的热能，除供烹炸炒煎使用外，其余的就通过炉膛里的盘环管传送到蒸气罐中去，使之经热处理发生蒸气，再通过同蒸气罐连接的排气管将蒸气输送到所需要蒸气的不同设备中去而发生作用。据统计，由盘环管吸收的热量所发生的蒸气，可供三个煮锅、一个蒸锅、一个淋浴室、五个食具消毒箱、五个顾客擦脸毛巾消毒箱和十马力蒸气机带动的七点五瓩电动机所需要的全部热量。
    这个灶的建成大大的改变了这个饭店的工作面貌。做饭的速度加快了；由于以蒸气代替烧煤，消除了灰尘烟雾等不卫生现象，改善了劳动条件，并且节约了大量资金。仅就用煤一项的统计，全年可以节省二百五十四吨，电费每年可节省一千三百二十元，加以节省劈柴、职工洗澡费等，一年可以节约资金一万五千多元。（附图片）
