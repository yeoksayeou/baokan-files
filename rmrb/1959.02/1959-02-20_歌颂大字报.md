    In Praise of Big-Character Posters
    Li Min, First Secretary of the CPC Shishou County Committee, Hubei Province
    During the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, the masses of Shishou County especially praised the benefits of big-character posters. They wrote a poem like this:

      Speaking of big-character posters, their power is truly great,
      Once they are mobilized, the earth shakes and the sky trembles.
      They can move mountains and change the course of rivers,
      Using them cures all diseases, better than magic fungus,
      Long live big-character posters, truly priceless treasures.

    The great harvest and great victory in industrial and agricultural production is the great harvest of thought, the great victory in the struggle between two roads. Big-character posters have demonstrated their powerful might in this fierce struggle. In the summer of 1958, there was a sudden downpour of 280 millimeters of rain, and the water rose more than two feet on the ground, and the seedling fields were covered in white waves. The public was once in chaos, and some unswerving cadres also began to retreat. For example, Hu Xueyan, the Party Branch Secretary of the Wu’ai Cooperative in Xinling Township, sat in his house complaining when he saw the cotton fields waterlogged. He didn't actively organize the masses to fight against the disaster. The masses were extremely dissatisfied and wrote a big-character poster to ridicule him:

      To fight the disaster, to fight the disaster,
      To fight the disaster, we need machines,
      If human power wants to overcome natural disasters,
      Unless the Heavenly Palace makes clever arrangements...

    In Xinling Cooperative, which is connected to Wu’ai Cooperative in Xinling Township, 90% of the fields were waterlogged, but Tian Meiyu, the Party Branch Secretary, held the firm belief that man can conquer nature, took the lead, mobilized the masses, and fought against the waterlogging day and night, ensuring that the seedlings were not damaged. Therefore, the masses wrote many big-character posters praising him, one of which was:

      Secretary Tian Meiyu, extremely energetic,
      Not afraid of the great waterlogging disaster, leading the great drainage,
      Working day and night, feet and hands were torn.
      For the great increase in production, so the masses have food to eat,
      Good Secretary Tian, everyone supports you.

    The Township General Branch seized these two big-character posters and launched a great debate in the whole township, severely criticizing Hu Xueyan's thinking and vigorously praising Tian Meiyu's enthusiasm. It called on the majority of cadres to learn from Tian Meiyu, this red flag, and the whole township immediately launched a production upsurge to resist disaster and protect the plan, and overcame the disaster. Hu Xueyan also admitted his mistake in the face of ironclad facts, actively participated in the disaster relief struggle, and created many miracles, and was elected to attend the county's "Five Goods" activists.

    Right-leaning conservative thinking is a great obstacle to the leap forward in production. "Mountainous and low-lying areas cannot increase production" is an excuse for those who believe only in conditions. When production was in full swing, they also compiled some big-character posters to pour cold water on people. People used big-character posters to debate with them and refute their arguments. There is a very vivid example in Shuangtaohong Cooperative in Taohua Township.

    Shuangtaohong Cooperative is a barren land with continuous mountains, thick rocks and thin soil, rugged terrain, sparse population, and scattered fields. After the battle drums of the Great Leap Forward sounded in 1958, the conservatives sang the old tune of a hundred years ago:

      Peach Blossom Mountain, Yellow Earth Ridge,
      The fields sit on the rocky slopes,
      If you want to harvest three shis per mu,
      Unless the stones turn into mud.

    Under the leadership of the Party, the awakened people resolutely wanted to compete with the peaks of Peach Blossom Mountain. The members of the cooperative wrote a big-character poster in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, expressing their determination:

      Liberate our minds and break superstitions,
      Don't listen to conservative nonsense,
      Determine to catch up with the advanced,
      Move mountains and seas to change the world.
      Chisel open rocks to plant gold,
      Build reservoirs to store silver,
      Plant money trees all over the mountains,
      Dig out treasure bowls everywhere.

    As soon as this big-character poster was posted, Peach Blossom Mountain boiled over, launching a vigorous production movement and carrying out large-scale technical innovation. After a year of hard work, they overcame drought, insect pests, and floods. The rock crevices really grew yellow grain according to people's wishes, and achieved a great harvest of rice, tripling the yield. The facts of victory educated the conservatives. When people sang about the great harvest, they also sang such a song:

      Great harvest, great harvest,
      Our minds were too confused,
      In the past, we didn't believe in the Great Leap Forward,
      The facts left us speechless,
      Now the poor mountains have become rich mountains,
      High mountains harvest grain, cotton and oil.
      Thanks to the Party's good leadership,
      Socialism has a bright future.

    Big-character posters have not only brought about a great leap forward in thinking, a great development in production, and a great transformation in the work style of cadres, but they have also played a role in changing customs.

    Zeng Heyuan, a member of the Dongsheng Fifth Cooperative in Yujia Township, was only forty-eight years old. He had always disliked labor and relied solely on his son to support the whole family. He also often scolded his son for being unfilial, and the father and son were at odds. Zeng Longcheng felt helpless and only posted a big-character poster to his father:

      My father, listen to me,
      You are only forty years old now,
      You always say you are old,
      You don't engage in production leap forward,
      You pretend to be sick and sleep in bed during the day,
      You mess around at home at night,
      You can't go on like this,
      We must ask everyone to comment.

    Zeng Heyuan was shocked when he heard that his son had written a big-character poster about him. He secretly ran to see it and, sure enough, adults and children were saying he was wrong. The more he thought about it, the more uncomfortable he felt, and he realized that he was wrong. He ran home, took off his shoes and socks, and went to work in production. During the drought resistance, he took care of two ox carts alone, worked conscientiously, never complained, and ensured that more than 100 mu of rice in the team was not affected by the drought. The members of the cooperative and his family praised him:

      Longcheng's big-character poster,
      His father changed after reading it.
      He used to not work every day,
      Now he works wonderfully.
      From then on, father and son are more harmonious,
      Helping each other to carry out the leap forward.
      The beautiful story spread throughout the cooperative,
      Everyone says it's thanks to the big-character poster.

### 歌颂大字报

    歌颂大字报
    中共湖北石首县委第一书记　　　李民
    在1958年工农业生产大跃进中，石首县群众特别歌颂大字报的好处，他们写了这样一首诗歌：
      说起大字报，威力真不小，
      它要一出动，地动天也摇。
      能叫山搬家，能叫河改道，
      用它医百病，胜过灵芝草，
      万岁大字报，真是无价宝。
    工农业生产的大丰收，大胜利，就是思想的大丰收，两条道路斗争的大胜利。大字报，在这场激烈的斗争中，显示出了强大的威力。在1958年的夏天，陡降暴雨二百八十公厘，平地起水两尺多，苗田翻起了白浪，群情一度陷于混乱，个别不坚定的干部，也打起了退堂鼓。像新陵乡的五爱社的支部书记胡学炎，当他看到棉田受了渍时，坐在屋里怨天怨地，不积极组织群众向灾害作斗争，群众极为不满，写了张大字报来嘲笑他：
      要抗灾来要抗灾，
      抗灾就弄机器来，
      人力要想胜天灾，
      除非天宫巧安排……
    同是新陵乡与五爱社相连的新陵社，受渍田亩达90％，但支部书记田美玉，却抱着人定胜天的坚定信心，身先上阵，发动群众，日夜和渍灾作斗争，保住了禾苗没受损失。因此，群众给他写了很多表扬的大字报，其中有一张是：
      书记田美玉，干劲大无比，
      不怕渍灾大，领导大排渍，
      日夜不下阵，脚手烂破皮。
      为的大增产，群众有饭吃，
      好个田书记，人人拥护你。
    乡总支抓住这两张大字报，在全乡开展了大辩论，严厉批判了胡学炎的思想，大力表扬了田美玉的干劲，号召广大干部学习田美玉这面红旗，全乡立即掀起了抗灾保规划的生产高潮，战胜了灾害。胡学炎在铁的事实面前也认了错，积极投入了抗灾斗争，并且创造了许多奇迹，被选为出席县里的“五好”积极分子。
    右倾保守思想，是生产跃进中的极大障碍。“山岗和低洼地区不能增产”是唯条件论者的借口。正当生产热火朝天的时候，他们也编了一些大字报，向人们泼冷水，人们利用大字报，和他们进行了论战，驳倒了他们的论点。桃花乡双桃红社就有个很生动的事例。
    双桃红社，是一个山脉绵延，石厚土薄，地势坎坷，人烟稀少，田亩星散的不毛之地。在1958年大跃进的战鼓擂响以后，保守主义者就唱起了百年前的老调：
      桃花山，黄土岗，
      田儿坐在岩坡上，
      若要亩田收三石，
      除非石头变泥浆。
    觉悟的人们，在党的领导下，坚决要与桃花山山峰较量。社员们在毛主席的像前，写了这样一张表决心的大字报：
      解放思想破迷信，
      莫听保守乱胡言，
      决心迎头超先进，
      移山倒海变乾坤。
      凿开岩石栽黄金，
      兴修水库储白银，
      满山尽植摇钱树，
      遍地挖出聚宝盆。
    这张大字报一贴，桃花山沸腾起来了，展开了轰轰烈烈的生产运动，大搞技术革新。经过了一年的苦战，战胜了旱魔、虫妖、水灾，岩缝里真的顺从人们的心意，长出了黄粮，取得了水稻翻三番的大丰收。胜利的事实，教育了保守派，在人们歌唱大丰收的时候，他们也唱出了这样一首歌：
      大丰收，大丰收，
      我们脑子太糊涂，
      过去不信大跃进，
      事实叫人哑了口，
      如今穷山变富山，
      高山丰收粮棉油。
      感谢党的好领导，
      社会主义有奔头。
    大字报不仅带来了思想大跃进、生产大发展和干部作风大转变，它还起到了移风易俗的作用。
    余家乡东升五社社员曾和远，年纪不过四十八岁，一贯不爱劳动，单靠他儿子一人劳动养活全家，还经常骂儿子不孝顺，父子俩闹得不和睦。曾龙成感到无办法，只有给爹贴了张大字报：
      我的爹，你是听，
      你今只有四十零，
      开口闭口人老了，
      生产跃进你不搞，
      白天装病床上困，
      夜间在家瞎糊混，
      这个样子你不行，
      要请大家评一评。
    曾和远听说儿子写了自己的大字报，心里不由得一惊，偷偷跑去一看，果然不错，大人、小孩都在说他的不是。他越想越难受，感到自己是错了，跑回家脱下鞋袜就出工生产了。抗旱时，一人照管两张牛车，生产认真，从不叫苦，保证了队里一百多亩稻谷未受旱，社员和家里人都赞扬他：
      龙成一张大字报，
      他爹一看转变了。
      过去天天不生产，
      现在劳动呱呱叫。
      从此父子更和睦，
      互相帮助把跃进搞。
      美名故事传全社，
      都说多亏大字报。
