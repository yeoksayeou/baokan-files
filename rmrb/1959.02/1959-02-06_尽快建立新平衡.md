Establish a New Balance as Quickly as Possible
Wang Pu

The Guangzhou Light Industry Department running its own raw material industry, Wuhan Iron and Steel running its own machinery and building materials industry, and Daye Steel Plant vigorously establishing satellite factories – these three events share a common and valuable spirit: striving to overcome difficulties through self-reliance while also seeking support from others, in order to achieve this year's Great Leap Forward plan.

After a year of practice last year, the planned targets for this year's industrial Great Leap Forward in our country are more in line with objective reality. We are always full of confidence in achieving this year's plan. But this does not mean that there are no difficulties on our road of the Great Leap Forward. How could there be no difficulties when we want to complete in a short period of time the journey that capitalist countries take several, ten, or even dozens of years to complete? For example, the Guangzhou Light Industry Department wants to double its output based on last year's Great Leap Forward, but it lacks some materials. Daye Steel Plant lacks refractory materials and ferroalloys in the Great Leap Forward, and Wuhan Iron and Steel lacks cement and some equipment in its construction. These are all difficulties. The reason these difficulties arise is that the production of these raw materials and equipment is low while the demand is high, rather than production being high and demand being low. We often say that the imbalance of various links in the development process of objective things is absolute and constant, while balance is relative and temporary. Revolutionary promoters must actively break the old balance and establish a new balance. However, some things cannot be established immediately after being broken; there must be a period of time from breaking to establishing. In the great development of industry, the temporary inability of the production of some materials and equipment to keep up is a manifestation of the old balance being broken while the new balance has not yet been fully established. This phenomenon not only exists now, but will also exist in the future, because imbalance is the objective law of development of all things. And these difficulties are all difficulties in the Great Leap Forward and are temporary.

However, we cannot allow the imbalance to develop freely. We must use the method of actively developing production to shorten the process of establishing a new balance. There are two aspects to actively developing production: First, the original production departments must expand reproduction as much as possible and produce more things to meet needs. This is without a doubt. Second, the user departments should rely on their own efforts, or run "satellite" factories for production, like the Guangzhou Light Industry Department, Wuhan Iron and Steel, and Daye Steel Plant; or, on the premise of ensuring product quality, find substitutes and improve product designs to save raw materials and manufacture more products with the same raw materials. In overcoming difficulties, striving for external assistance and self-reliance should be carried out simultaneously, which can also be said to be walking on two legs. There is no need to say more about the fact that walking on two legs is faster than walking on one leg.

Some people call the user departments running their own "satellite" factories engaging in "sidelines." This statement is also correct. Because the purpose of Wuhan Iron and Steel running its own machinery factory and cement factory is to accelerate its own construction; the purpose of Daye Steel Plant running its own refractory material factory is to produce more steel; and the purpose of the Guangzhou Light Industry Department running its own raw material industry is to produce more light industrial products. Saying that "satellite" factories are "sidelines" is not to underestimate "satellite" factories, but to illustrate that one must distinguish between primary and secondary tasks when handling affairs. If primary and secondary tasks are not distinguished, and the leadership of the original factory's production or construction is weakened in order to run "satellite" factories, the gains will not outweigh the losses.

    尽快建立新平衡
    王朴
    广州市轻工业部门自办原材料工业、武钢自办机械和建筑材料工业和大冶钢厂大办卫星厂这三件事，有一个共同的可贵的精神，就是在力争别人的支援的同时，自力更生战胜困难，实现今年的大跃进计划。
    经过去年一年的实践，我国今年工业大跃进的计划指标，更加符合于客观实际。实现今年的计划，我们总是满怀着信心。但这并不等于在我们大跃进的道路上没有任何困难。资本主义国家要几年、十几年甚至几十年才走完的路程，我们要在短期内走完，怎会一点困难也没有呢？例如广州市轻工业要在去年大跃进的基础上翻一番，有些材料不足，大冶钢厂在大跃进中耐火材料和铁合金不足，武钢在建设中水泥和部分设备不足等等，就都是困难。这些困难所以产生，是因为这些原材料、设备生产少，需要多，而不是生产多，需要少。我们常常讲，客观事物各个环节在发展过程中的不平衡是绝对的，经常的，而平衡则是相对的，暂时的，革命的促进派必须积极打破旧的平衡，建立新的平衡。但是，有些东西不可能破了马上立，从破到立要有一个时间。在工业的大发展中，有些材料和设备的生产暂时跟不上去，就是旧的平衡打破了，而新的平衡还没有完全建立起来的表现。这种现象，不仅现在有，将来也还会有，因为不平衡是一切事物发展的客观规律。而这些困难，都是大跃进中的困难，是暂时的。
    但是，我们不能让不平衡现象自流发展。我们必须用积极发展生产的办法来缩短新平衡的建立过程。积极发展生产有两个方面：一是原来的生产部门要尽量扩大再生产，生产更多的东西来满足需要。这是毫无疑问的。二是使用部门自力更生，或者办“卫星”工厂生产，如广州市轻工业部门、武钢和大冶钢厂那样；或者在保证产品质量的条件下，找寻代用品和改进产品设计，节约原材料，用同样的原材料制造更多的产品。在克服困难中，力争外援和自力更生同时并举，也可说是用两条腿走路。两条腿走路，比一条腿走路快，道理用不着多讲了。
    有人把使用部门自办“卫星”厂叫做搞“副业”。这种说法也对。因为武钢自办机械厂和水泥厂，目的是为了加速自己的建设；大冶钢厂自办耐火材料厂，目的是为了生产更多的钢；广州轻工业部门自办原料工业，目的是为了生产更多的轻工业品。说“卫星”厂是“副业”，并非轻视“卫星”厂，只是说明办事要分清主次。主次不分，为了办“卫星”厂，而削弱对原来工厂生产或建设的领导，就是得不偿失了。
