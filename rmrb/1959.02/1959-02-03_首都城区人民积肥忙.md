"With fertilizer comes grain, manure is like gold." As the drums of fertilizer accumulation resounded throughout the country's rural areas, the people in the capital's urban areas, under the call of the Party, also set off a high tide of fertilizer accumulation.

On January 30th, the capital held a radio broadcast conference on accumulating and making fertilizer. The next day, the urban people, guided by the banner of fertilizer accumulation, took action. Although the movement had just begun that day, it quickly formed a surge. Sewers, moats, vegetable markets, and garbage heaps in streets and alleys... all became places of attention.

Workers and Peasants are One Family

The workers of the Zhou Qi group of the first work section of the Sewerage Team of the Maintenance and Management Office of the Municipal Engineering Bureau, after holding a meeting to study the issue of fertilizer accumulation, rushed to the construction site of digging out sewer sludge in Donkey Colt Alley outside Xuanwu Gate. Zhou Qi said to his partners: "Today is the first day of the blitz for fertilizer accumulation. In order to prepare fertilizer for our farmer brothers, we must work harder!" They immediately started to work. The person cranking the winch cranked it rapidly, and the person lifting the iron can quickly lifted the iron can from the well, pouring the sludge into the manure bucket. In less than two and a half hours, thirty-three manure buckets were filled with dark sludge. In the past, the fertilizer accumulation carts of the Huangtugang People's Commune in the suburbs would arrive near noon, and they hadn't filled the manure buckets yet. Today, when the commune's fertilizer accumulation cart arrived on time, Luo Chunsheng, the commune member driving the cart, saw that the manure buckets were full of sludge. He not only admired the workers' enthusiasm but also greatly praised the quality of the manure dug out today. Zhou Qi didn't tell Luo Chunsheng about the workers' enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer, but first asked Luo Chunsheng about the progress of fertilizer accumulation in the commune. Luo Chunsheng happily said: "The commune has already held a mobilization meeting. Each mu of land needs to accumulate 50,000 jin of fertilizer." Zhou Qi and the other workers were delighted to hear this and quickly said, "Good! Send more carts, we guarantee to fill as many as you send, and help you complete the fertilizer accumulation task! We won't rest on Sundays either!" Luo Chunsheng also grinned and helped to scoop out the sludge, and the workers also helped Luo Chunsheng load the manure cart. By evening, a total of seventy-four buckets of sludge fertilizer had been accumulated that day, an increase of fourteen buckets compared to the previous day.

The Battle on the Moat

The riverbed of the moat outside Fuxingmen was filled with a large area of people working hard. These were more than eighty cadres and maintenance workers from the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau and the Maintenance and Management Office of the Municipal Engineering Bureau making and accumulating fertilizer here.

There was still flowing water in the center of the riverbed, but the dry areas were all black silt with great fertilizer effect. Now, under this long riverbank, what people saw was no longer a frozen river beach, but a hot labor scene. Everywhere was the sound of people cheering and shovels flying. Some people were digging river mud, and some people were burning some dead branches they had collected as ash fertilizer. One by one, they took off their cotton coats and were still sweating. The maintenance workers were strong, and under the leadership of advanced producer Luo Zhong, they quickly accumulated one pile of fertilizer after another. The cadres also closely followed them. Lei Feng, the secretary of the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, not only came to accumulate fertilizer himself today, but also brought his child to work with him. The father and son took turns shoveling the river mud into the soil baskets, one with a large iron shovel and the other with a small iron shovel. Liu Zenrong, a commune member from the Sijiqing People's Commune in the suburbs, passed by here driving a cart. He was very moved by the lively scene of fertilizer accumulation.

For a whole afternoon, the cadres and workers of the Municipal Engineering Bureau's Maintenance and Management Office accumulated a total of 200,000 jin of river mud. The cadres of the Construction Engineering Bureau also completed the task of accumulating 500 jin of fertilizer per person per day and a half in this half day.

Vegetable Market Fertilizer is Even More Fertile

After the salespeople of Xidan Vegetable Market sent away the last batch of customers, a blitz to accumulate fertilizer unfolded in the market. Under the call of the market's Party branch, more than one hundred employees all joined the battle. The "Liu Hulan" group – the female salespeople of the pastry and candy group – first proposed the challenge of accumulating more fertilizer and better fertilizer. Without waiting for a response, the salespeople of the vegetable group immediately took action, filling a basket with the leftover messy vegetable leaves near the vegetable beds that day. The salespeople of the meat group hurried to the ditch to remove the accumulated dirt. Several salespeople from the aquatic products group had another trick up their sleeves. They opened the seepage well and found a source of fertilizer. One salesperson took the lead in picking up a large spoon and scooping upwards, scooping out the waste they had thrown out when selling fish and shrimp, which had now been composted until it was completely black. "What great fertilizer!" Everyone was extremely excited. They shouted loudly to the people carrying the baskets: "Carry it to the backyard so that the commune members from the Sijiqing People's Commune who deliver vegetables tomorrow can take it back!"

The Elderly Who Can't Stay Idle

More than seventy elderly people in the Chunshu Hutong jurisdiction of Xuanwu District also plunged into the battle of fertilizer accumulation with great vigor. They dispersed into more than one hundred and ten hutongs, using bamboo brooms, dustpans, and small carts to sweep up the dirt, fruit peels, and garbage on the streets. There are many horse-drawn carriages passing through Xicaochang Hutong every day, so there is also a lot of horse manure. Now all this horse manure has been collected by the sixty-year-old Song. Li Zihua, a sixty-seven-year-old man, was like a young man in this fertilizer accumulation battle. Together with another old man, Jia Shenglin, one with a broom and one pushing a small cart, they swept up all the garbage on the road in Tiemen Hutong and transported it to the dirt station. He swept from eight o'clock in the morning until ten o'clock, without resting. When people advised him to take a break, he stroked his white beard and said, "As the saying goes: domestic soil enriches the wild land, and only with a great agricultural harvest can we live a good life. I can't do heavy work, but I also want to contribute to fertilizer accumulation." That morning, he and Jia Shenglin accumulated two full carts of fertilizer.

Let the "Imperial Palace" Also Serve the "Grain Marshal"

Large trucks carrying garbage fertilizer bustled back and forth, breaking the silence of the Forbidden City. The white-haired old director and more than four hundred staff members, scattered around the courtyards, warehouses, and offices of the Forbidden City, picked up their "new business" – accumulating fertilizer. Everyone worked together to clean up, shovel away miscellaneous trees and weeds, and remove dirty soil and garbage. The temporary garbage fertilizer station was set up in the northeast corner of the Forbidden City. The large trucks returning from the suburbs were hurriedly loading the garbage fertilizer cleaned out from this group of palaces that day. Suddenly, three cadres covered in dirt enthusiastically pushed a small cart of garbage, containing both organic and inorganic garbage. Zhang Jinghua, the general commander in charge of this cleanup, saw this situation and immediately shouted to them: "There is coal cinder inside, which is inorganic garbage, and cannot be used as fertilizer, pour it in another place!"

The "general commander," pointing to the area where he was standing, said with emotion: "Nearly a hundred years of garbage has accumulated here. When we cleared it a few years ago, we didn't think of using the garbage as fertilizer, and filled it all in the pits. Judging from this matter, people in the city also need to develop the habit of accumulating fertilizer!" The headquarters immediately issued a notice to all staff through wired broadcasting, asking everyone to pay attention to the quality of fertilizer when clearing garbage, separating organic and inorganic matter, and sending good fertilizer to the countryside.

    首都城区人民积肥忙
    本报记者　孙兴恺　王孔诚　邵泉
    “有肥就有粮，粪土如黄金。”当积肥的战鼓响遍了全国农村的时候，首都的城区人民在党的号召下也掀起了积肥运动的高潮。
    1月30日，首都举行了积肥造肥广播大会。第二天，城区人民就在积肥的帅旗引导下行动起来了。这一天，运动虽然刚刚开始，但是迅速形成了热潮。下水道，护城河，菜市场，以及街头巷尾的垃圾堆……，都成为人们注目的地方。
    工农本是一家人
    市政工程局养护管理处下水道队第一工段周棋小组的工人们，在开过了研究积肥问题的会议以后，赶紧来到了宣武门外驴驹胡同掏挖下水道污泥的工地上。周棋对伙伴们说：“今天是突击积肥的第一天，为了给农民兄弟准备肥料，我们一定要加劲干！”他们立时动起手来，摇绞车的人把绞车摇的飞转，提铁罐的人把铁罐迅速地由井中提上来，把污泥倒进粪桶里。不到两个半小时，把三十三个粪桶装满了黑黝黝的污泥。往日快到中午的时候，郊区黄土岗人民公社的积肥大车赶来了，他们还没有把粪桶掏满。今天，公社积肥大车按时到来的时候，赶车的社员罗春生看见粪桶里都装满了污泥，他不光对工人们的干劲很佩服，而且对今天掏出的粪的质量大大赞扬。周棋没有告诉罗春生工人们积肥的干劲，却先问罗春生公社里开展积肥的情况。罗春生高兴地说：“公社已经开过动员会了，每亩地要积肥五万斤。”周棋和其它工人一听都乐了，连忙说：“好！你们多来车，来多少我们保证装多少，协助你们完成积肥任务！星期天我们也不休息啦！”罗春生也乐开了，他也动手帮助掏污泥，工人们也帮着罗春生装粪车。战斗到傍晚，这天共积污泥肥七十四桶，比前一天增加十四桶。
    护城河上的战斗
    复兴门外护城河的河床里布满了一大片紧张劳动的人。这是北京市建筑工程局、市政工程局养护管理处的八十多个干部和养护工人在这里造肥积肥。
    河床的中心还有流水，但干涸的地方都是肥效很大的发黑的淤泥。现在，在这长长的河堤下，人们看到的已不是冰冻的河滩，而是火热的劳动场面。到处是人声沸腾、铁锹翻飞，有的人在挖河泥，有的人把收集来的一些枯树枝烧了作灰肥。他们一个个脱去棉衣还汗流浃背。养护工人力气大，在先进生产者骆中的带头下，飞快地积起了一个又一个的肥堆。干部们也紧紧地跟在他们后边。北京市建筑工程局秘书雷风今天不光自己来积肥，还带了他的孩子一起来劳动。他父子俩一个拿着大铁锨，一个拿着小铁锨，轮番地把河泥铲到土筐里。郊区四季青人民公社赶大车的社员刘增荣从这里经过，他看着这热闹的积肥场面，非常感动。
    整整一个下午，市政工程局养护管理处的干部和工人共积河泥二十万斤，建筑工程局的干部原先计划每人一天半积肥五百斤的任务也在这半天里完成了。
    菜市肥料更加肥
    西单菜市场的售货员送走了最后一批顾客，一个突击积肥的运动就在市场内展开了。一百多职工在市场党支部的号召下，全部投入战斗。“刘胡兰”小组——糕点糖果组的女售货员们首先提出了多积肥、积好肥的挑战。蔬菜组的售货员没等应战，就先行动起来，把当天菜床附近剩下的乱菜叶，装了满满一筐。肉食组的售货员们赶忙到地沟旁清除淤积的脏物。水产组的几个售货员却另有窍门，他们打开渗井找到了肥源。一位售货员抢先拿起大勺往上掏，掏出的都是他们卖鱼虾时抛出的废物，现在已经沤得一片乌黑。“多么好的肥料啊！”大家兴奋极了。他们高声向抬筐的人呼喊：“把它抬到后院，明天好让四季青人民公社送菜来的社员拉回去！”
    闲不住的老人
    宣武区椿树胡同管界七十多位老人也精神抖擞地投入了积肥的战斗。他们分散到一百一十多条胡同里，用竹扫帚、簸箕和小推车，清扫着街上脏土、果皮和垃圾。西草厂胡同每天有很多马车过往，马粪也就特别多。现在这些马粪都被年过花甲的宋老汉收集起来了。六十七岁的老汉李子华在这场积肥战中像小伙子一样。他和另一个老汉贾盛林一起，一个拿扫帚，一个推小车，在铁门胡同把路上的一切垃圾都扫起来，运到脏土站上。他从早上八点钟一直扫到十点钟，还不休息。人家劝他歇一会，他捋着白花花的胡子说：“俗语说：家土壮野地，有了农业大丰产才能过好日子，我干不了重活，也要为积肥出一把力气。”这天早上，他和贾盛林两人积了满满两车的肥料。
    让“皇宫”也为
      “粮帅”服务
    赶运垃圾肥料的大卡车往返奔忙，冲破了故宫的寂静。头发花白的老院长和四百多名工勤人员，分散在故宫庭院、库房和办公室周围，操起他们的“新业务”——积肥，大家一齐动手大扫除，铲掉杂树乱草，清除脏土垃圾。临时垃圾肥料站设在故宫内的东北角。从郊区回来的大卡车，在这里赶装着当天从这座宫殿群清扫出来的垃圾肥料。忽然有三个满身尘垢的干部兴致勃勃地推来一小车垃圾，里面有有机垃圾，也有无机垃圾。负责这次大扫除的总指挥张景华，看到这种情形，立即向他们呼喊：“里边有石炭渣，是无机垃圾，不能作肥料，倒在另个地方！”
    这位“总指挥”指着他站在那儿的一带地方，感慨地说：“这里曾堆积了近百年的垃圾，前几年清除时就没想到利用垃圾作肥料，通统都填了坑。从这件事情看来，城里人积肥也得养成习惯啊！”指挥部立即通过有线广播向全院人员发出注意肥料质量的号召，要求大家清除垃圾时把有机物和无机物分开，把好肥送给农村。
