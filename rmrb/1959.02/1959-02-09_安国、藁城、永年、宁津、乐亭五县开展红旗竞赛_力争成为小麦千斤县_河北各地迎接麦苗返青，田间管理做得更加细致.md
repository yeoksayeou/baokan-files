Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 8th: An'guo, Gaocheng, Yongnian, Ningjin, Leting and other five counties in Hebei Province are launching a red flag competition for thousand-jin wheat counties, striving to achieve an average wheat yield of one thousand jin per mu this year. This competition has greatly inspired the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, and they are carrying out wheat field management work more scientifically and meticulously than in previous years.

The five counties participating in the thousand-jin wheat county red flag competition—An'guo, Gaocheng, Yongnian, Ningjin, and Leting—were all advanced counties that won red flag awards for high wheat yields in the province last year. They have experience in cultivating large areas of high-yield wheat. Based on last year's experience, they are confidently studying and determining advanced targets for achieving a wheat yield of one thousand jin per mu this year. These targets are generally one or two times higher than last year's wheat yield in their respective counties, with Leting County's target being more than three times higher than last year's yield.

Due to the launch of the thousand-jin wheat county red flag competition, a vigorous upsurge in wheat field management has rapidly emerged in the five counties. The broad masses of commune members are diligently fertilizing and watering the wheat fields again and again. Some have also carried out urine irrigation, covering the roots with sand, watering with human manure, and rolling the wheat. According to statistics from An'guo, Ningjin, and Yongnian counties, more than 300,000 people are currently involved in wheat field management work. Many communes, in order to provide sufficient fertilizer for wheat, are making every effort to explore various fertilizer sources after applying tens of thousands of jin of fertilizer to the wheat fields. In Qizhou People's Commune, An'guo County, more than 200 young men and women from Liucun Brigade voluntarily undertook the task of collecting urine to irrigate the wheat. In just ten days, they completely equipped the toilets on both sides of highways and streets with urine collection devices. They have now collected 570,000 jin of urine and irrigated more than 400 mu of wheat. All counties have implemented a wheat field management system with special personnel in charge, layer-by-layer contracting, the establishment of professional teams, and "five fixings," ensuring comprehensive management from now until harvest and specialized management for each plot. Gaocheng and Ningjin selected more than 90,000 people to form professional teams and made specific divisions of labor for the management of more than 400,000 mu of wheat. Gaocheng County also fixed more than 600 secretaries from county, commune, and brigade-level Party organizations to specifically grasp wheat management. Leting County also established a file system for 150,000 mu of wheat, recording the wheat growth in detail at any time in order to summarize experience in the future. Junxi Brigade of Wurenqiao People's Commune in An'guo County, through a general survey and identification of the soil, revised the fertilization plan and wheat field management measures based on various soil types and soil fertility.

After the launch of the thousand-jin wheat county red flag competition movement, the counties showed even greater enthusiasm for comparing with and catching up with the advanced. They sent people to visit and learn from each other, constantly exchanging experiences and improving their work. Song Lan'ge, Secretary of the Ningjin County Party Committee, recently led the first secretaries of each commune to visit An'guo. After returning, he immediately convened a telephone conference, launching a large-scale blitz of watering and fertilizing throughout the county and promoting An'guo County's experience of covering black alkaline soil with sand. To achieve the goal of becoming a thousand-jin wheat county, the people's communes and the people's communes, the production teams and the production teams, have also launched red flag competitions. Ningjin County, based on three rounds of evaluation and competition held throughout the county, is also preparing to launch another large-scale competition movement in the spring wheat field management. Leting County recently conducted an evaluation and competition of wheat field management work. Many communes have further strengthened wheat field management work.

The five counties' thousand-jin wheat county red flag competition has been echoed by many other counties. More than a dozen counties, including Yutian, Xianxian, Shexian, and Cixian, have now invested in the competition movement to strive for a bumper wheat harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 8th: The wheat fields in Hebei Province have gradually thawed, and the wheat seedlings in the southern regions are about to begin regreening. Cadres and the masses in various places are taking active measures to strive for more large areas of wheat fields to achieve a thousand-jin yield per mu.

Currently, cadres and the masses in Hebei Province have faced the regreening stage and carried out meticulous management such as topdressing, urine application, and watering of wheat for more than 36 million mu of wheat fields. According to recent statistics, the province has invested approximately 2 million laborers in wheat field management, watered 24.09 million mu of wheat, an increase of 10 million mu compared to the same period last year, and topdressed more than 27 million mu, an increase of four times compared to the same period last year.

Hebei Province is vigorously developing large-area, high-yield wheat production to ensure that large areas of wheat fields achieve a yield of 1,000 jin per mu. Through meticulous processing and cultivation, more than 22.16 million mu of wheat fields in the province have been gardenized, and a total of 11.83 million mu of large-area high-yield wheat fields have been determined, accounting for approximately one-third of the province's total wheat fields. These wheat fields have better irrigation conditions, have been deeply plowed and densely planted, and have dense seedlings and sufficient fertilizer. The wheat seedlings are growing vigorously, and the yield target is more than double that of ordinary wheat fields. At present, various places are focusing on the management of these wheat fields before regreening, increasing fertilizer and water to ensure that the wheat seedlings are well-fed and watered, and striving to achieve high-yield plans.

In the movement to strive for a yield of 1,000 jin per mu in large-area high-yield wheat fields, Hebei Province has also universally strengthened the management of all wheat fields before the wheat seedlings regreen, especially strengthening the partial fertilization and watering of the third category of wheat seedlings to promote the general upgrading of these wheat seedlings during regreening. After organizing professional teams and dividing war zones for specialized partial fertilization and watering management, all the third category of wheat seedlings in the province have been upgraded. In order to ensure that alkali land wheat also achieves a bumper harvest, Nandong and other people's communes in Gaocheng County organized more than 8,000 laborers and more than 800 carts, and adopted the method of applying sand fertilizer to sticky soil and soil fertilizer to sandy soil. Before the wheat seedlings regreened, more than 3,500 mu of alkaline land wheat was transformed. After partial fertilization and watering in Hengshui County, 200,000 mu of the 340,000 mu of third-class seedlings have been upgraded to second-class, and more than 100,000 mu have jumped to first-class.

In order to strengthen the management of wheat fields before the wheat seedlings regreen, the province has fixed more than 2.69 million laborers to manage high-yield plots, forming 25,903 professional teams. These professional teams have launched a five-check and five-compare campaign (check measures and compare reality, check enthusiasm and compare momentum, check advanced techniques and compare quality, check technology and compare effectiveness, check research and compare creativity), making wheat field management work very active. Various places have also universally promoted the cadre four-package system (county cadres package communes, commune cadres package teams and plots, team cadres package groups and sections, and commune members package ridges and furrows) and the labor five-fix system (fixed personnel, fixed quality, fixed plots, fixed measures, fixed time). A file registration system has been established for 1.68 million mu of high-yield fields in the Baoding Special Zone. At present, the management movement before the wheat seedlings regreen in Hebei Province is developing in a more detailed direction. (Attached picture)

    安国、藁城、永年、宁津、乐亭五县开展红旗竞赛
    力争成为小麦千斤县
    河北各地迎接麦苗返青，田间管理做得更加细致
    新华社天津8日电　河北省安  国、藁城、永年、宁津、乐亭等五县正在开展小麦千斤县的红旗竞赛，力争今年全县小麦平均亩产达到一千斤。这个竞赛大大鼓舞了广大干部和群众的干劲，他们麦田管理工作作得比往年更科学更细致。
    参加小麦千斤县红旗竞赛的安国、藁城、永年、宁津、乐亭等五县，都是去年在全省获得小麦丰产红旗奖励的先进县，他们有培植小麦大面积丰产的经验，在去年丰产经验的基础上，他们信心百倍地研究和确定了今年力争小麦亩产千斤的先进指标。这些指标一般都比去年的本县的小麦产量增长了一倍或两倍，乐亭县的指标比去年产量增长了三倍多。
    由于开展了小麦千斤县红旗竞赛，五个县迅速掀起了声势浩大的麦田管理高潮。广大社员群众精心的给麦田一次又一次的追肥、浇水，有的还进行了灌尿、盖砂围根，浇人粪稀和轧麦。据安国、宁津、永年三县统计，目前投入麦田管理工作的有三十多万人。许多公社为使小麦有足够的肥料，给麦田上过万斤左右的追肥后，还在千方百计的挖掘各种肥源。安国县祁州人民公社流村大队的二百多名男女青年，他们自动担负了积尿浇麦的任务，仅十天时间，就把公路、街道两侧的厕所完全设置了尿具，现已积尿五十七万斤，浇麦四百多亩。各县都实行了专人领导、层层包干、建立专业队和“五定”的麦田管理制度，作到从现在到收获时一包到底和块块垅垅有专人管理。藁城、宁津选拔了九万多人组成了专业队，对四十多万亩小麦的管理工作进行了具体的分工。藁城县还固定六百多名县、社、大队三级党组织的书记专门抓小麦管理。乐亭县还对十五万亩小麦建立了档案制，把小麦生长情况随时详细记录下来，以便将来总结经验。安国县伍任桥人民公社军洗大队，通过土壤的普查和鉴定，根据各种不同的土质和地力，重新修订了施肥计划和麦田管理措施。
    小麦千斤县红旗竞赛运动开始后，各县比先进、赶先进的劲头更大，他们互相派人参观学习，不断地交流经验，改进自己的工作。中共宁津县委书记处书记宋兰阁最近带领各公社第一书记到安国参观回来后，立即召开了电话会议，在全县掀起了浇水、追肥的大突击。并推行了安国县黑土碱性地盖砂的经验。为实现小麦千斤县，各县人民公社和人民公社之间，生产队和生产队之间，也都展开了红旗竞赛。宁津县在全县已评比竞赛三次的基础上，还准备在春季麦田管理上再来一个大规模的竞赛运动。乐亭县最近进行了一次麦田管理工作的评比竞赛。许多公社都进一步加强了麦田管理工作。
    五个县小麦千斤县红旗竞赛已经得到其他许多县的响应，玉田、献县、涉县、磁县等十多个县现在都投入了争取小麦大丰收的竞赛运动。
    据新华社天津8日电　河北省的麦田已逐渐消冻，南部地区麦苗即将开始返青，各地干部群众，正在采取积极措施，力争更多的大面积麦田实现千斤丰产。
    河北省的干部群众，目前已迎着返青关，给三千六百多万亩麦田普遍进行追肥、浇尿、浇麦等细致的管理。根据最近的统计，全省投入麦田管理的劳力约达二百万人，浇麦二千四百零九万亩，比去年同期增加一千万亩，追肥二千七百多万亩，比去年同期增加了四倍。
    河北各地正大搞大面积高额丰产麦，以保证大面积麦田实现亩产千斤。经过细致的加工培植，全省已有二千二百一十六万多亩麦田做到了园田化，已确定的大面积丰产麦田共一千一百八十三万亩，约占全省麦田总数的三分之一。这些麦田土地灌溉条件较好，经过深耕密植，苗密肥足，麦苗生长茁壮，产量指标高过一般麦田一倍以上。目前各地正在狠狠地抓这些麦田返青前的管理，大量增肥增水，让麦苗吃饱喝足，力争实现高额丰产计划。
    河北各地在力争大面积丰产麦田亩产千斤的运动中，并普遍加强对所有麦田在麦苗返青前的管理，特别是加强对三类麦苗的偏肥偏水，促使这些麦苗在返青时普遍升级。全省三类麦苗经过组织专业队，划分战区专人进行偏肥偏水的管理后，已全部升了级。藁城县南董等人民公社为使碱地麦同样获得丰收，组织了八千多名劳力，八百多辆大车，采取粘土地追沙肥，沙土地追土肥的办法，在麦苗返青前，将三千五百多亩碱性地麦进行了改造。衡水县经过偏肥偏水，三十四万亩三类苗已有二十万亩升到二级，有十多万亩跃进到一级。
    为加强麦苗返青前的麦田管理，全省固定到管理丰产方的劳动力有二百六十九万多人，组成二万五千九百零三个专业队。这些专业队互相掀起五查五比（查措施比现实、查干劲比声势、查先进比质量、查技术比效果、查钻研比创造）的竞赛，使麦田管理工作进行得非常活跃。各地还普遍推行了干部四包
  （县干部包公社，社干部包队、包方，队干部包组、包块，社员包畦、包垅）和劳力的五定（定人、定质量、定地块、定措施、定时间）。保定专区一百六十八万亩丰产田普遍建立了档案登记制度。目前河北省小麦返青前的管理运动正在向更细致的方向发展。（附图片）
