Xinhua News Agency, 13th - The China-Soviet Friendship Association and the Beijing China-Soviet Friendship Association held an evening party at the Tianqiao Theater this evening to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance with great enthusiasm.
    At the evening party filled with fraternal friendship, Chinese and Soviet comrades unanimously celebrated the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, which has erected a bridge to communism in front of all mankind, and warmly congratulated the invincible Sino-Soviet alliance as being as firm as steel and as constant as the sun and moon, and congratulated the deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, which will last forever.
    The celebration evening began at seven o'clock. Seated on the rostrum were Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Presidents of the China-Soviet Friendship Association Wu Yuzhang, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Liu Ningyi, Liao Chengzhi, Li Dequan, Shen Yanbing, Secretary-General Qian Junrui, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Minister of Supervision, and Deputy Head of the Chinese Labor People's Delegation to the Soviet Union for the 41st Anniversary of the October Revolution, Qian Ying, President of the Beijing China-Soviet Friendship Association Deng Tuo, Vice President Yang Yong, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan.
    Also seated on the rostrum were Soviet Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to China Antonov, Commercial Representative Yelyomin, and Counselor Sudarikov.
    Attending the celebration evening were: Vice Presidents of the China-Soviet Friendship Association Li Siguang, Ma Yinchu, Shao Lizi, Li Zhuchen, Councilors Shi Liang, Chen Shutong, Cai Tingkai, Xiao Hua, Xiao Jingguang, and Zhang Xiruo. Also attending the celebration evening were heads of various departments and representatives of people from all walks of life in the capital.
    Also attending the celebration evening were diplomatic envoys of various fraternal countries to China and some Soviet experts in Beijing. Soviet People's Artist, Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic People's Artist Zyt Kuuzik, and Tallinn National Conservatory of Music piano accompanist Tarsina Arang, who were invited to visit our country, also attended the evening party.
    The celebration evening was presided over by Wu Yuzhang. Wu Yuzhang said in his speech: "We are gathered here today at a time when China and the Soviet Union are experiencing many joyous events. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union successfully held its 21st Congress not long ago and adopted a magnificent seven-year plan for building communism. On February 7th, the governments of China and the Soviet Union signed an agreement in Moscow on further expanding economic cooperation between the two countries. Everyone of us is very happy about these exciting major events. Let us all cheer for the successful conclusion of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, for the magnificent program of the Soviet Union to build communism, for the further development and consolidation of the friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union, and for the ninth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance! Let us extend our heartfelt and warm congratulations to all the Soviet comrades present and to the great fraternal Soviet people."
    Go Baoquan, Deputy Secretary-General of the China-Soviet Friendship Association, read the congratulatory telegram from Song Qingling, President of the China-Soviet Friendship Association, to Andreyev, Chairman of the Council of the Soviet-China Friendship Association.
    Then Qian Ying delivered a speech. She said: "We celebrate this great festival every year with extremely excited and happy feelings. However, participating in today's celebration meeting, we feel particularly excited and happy, because recently, for us, it has really been a series of joyous events."
    She immediately said that the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was a major event in contemporary political life and has great historical significance. More than forty years ago, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union led the people to open the road to socialism for all mankind. Today, the seven-year plan proposed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has erected a bridge to communism in front of all mankind.
    Qian Ying talked about her impressions of visiting the Soviet Union last year, warmly praising the great victories of the Soviet Union's construction in all aspects and the Soviet Union's consistent pursuit of a peaceful foreign policy. She also said that we firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the CPSU Central Committee headed by Comrade Khrushchev, the heroic Soviet people will surely be able to successfully complete the seven-year plan and achieve even greater victories along the road of communism.
    When Qian Ying talked about the great Sino-Soviet alliance, she said: "The alliance between China and the Soviet Union is an alliance to defend peace. For nine years, China and the Soviet Union have stood shoulder to shoulder, united and supported each other, and made great contributions to the cause of world peace. We are very pleased to see that the unity between China and the Soviet Union has become more and more consolidated, and the comprehensive cooperation between the two countries has become more and more intimate. This unity and cooperation is not only a powerful factor in promoting the prosperity of our two countries, but also an important part of the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the most reliable guarantee for world peace and the cause of human progress."
    Qian Ying pointed out: In celebrating the ninth anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance, the Chinese people sincerely thank the Soviet government and the Soviet people for their great and selfless assistance to our socialist construction cause.
    Qian Ying listed facts and said: "The Soviet Union has repeatedly provided our country with loans with extremely favorable terms, supplied our country with a large number of modern equipment and other industrial and agricultural construction materials, helped our country build a series of large-scale industrial enterprises that are of great importance to our industrialization, and helped our country improve its scientific and technological level through various methods. The Soviet experts who have come to our country to help with construction have unreservedly contributed their rich scientific and technological knowledge and full energy to our construction cause. Since the great leap forward in our socialist construction last year, the Soviet Union's support for our country has been particularly strengthened. When we visited the Soviet Union, we personally saw many factories and enterprises rushing to produce equipment for China, and the workers there regarded supporting China's construction as their own glorious cause. We also saw that the Soviet people were training construction talents for China like cultivating their own children, and hundreds of thousands of Chinese students and interns received the kind care and enthusiastic help of Soviet teachers, classmates, and worker brothers."
    Qian Ying also said that recently China and the Soviet Union signed an agreement to further expand economic cooperation between the two countries. This agreement is another great internationalist assistance from the Soviet people to the Chinese people, and it has an extremely important role in the smooth realization of our national economic plan.
    Qian Ying emphasized: "The friendship between China and the Soviet Union is the friendship between two socialist fraternal countries. Our friendship, which is based on the principles of proletarian internationalism, is eternal and unbreakable. The imperialists headed by the United States and the Yugoslav modern revisionists have used all despicable means,妄想 to discover and create so-called 'differences' between China and the Soviet Union. This can only show that they are at the end of their rope and are struggling in vain."
    Qian Ying finally said: "The Chinese people have always cherished the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people like they cherish their own eyes, and will always regard strengthening the unity between our two countries as their sacred internationalist duty. The Chinese people will always stand together with the Soviet people and strive unremittingly for the bright future of mankind and for the victory of our common cause."
    In warm applause, Antonov took the stage to speak. He first said, on behalf of the Soviet Embassy and all the Soviet comrades present, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the China-Soviet Friendship Association and the Beijing China-Soviet Friendship Association for organizing this evening party. Here I would like to express my warm congratulations on the further development of the great Soviet-Chinese friendship, which is beneficial to the people of our two countries and world peace. Antonov then read the congratulatory telegram from Andreyev, Chairman of the Council of the Soviet-China Friendship Association, to Song Qingling, President of the China-Soviet Friendship Association.
    The speeches of Wu Yuzhang, Qian Ying, and Antonov were constantly met with warm applause from all the comrades in the audience.
    At the evening party, literary and art workers of the capital performed wonderful programs of music and dance. Soviet guests Zyt Kuuzik and Tarsina Arang were also invited to participate in the performance, which was warmly welcomed by the participants. At the end of the evening party, all the comrades present stood up, applauded warmly, and sang the song "Moscow-Beijing."
    Our newspaper reports that on the eve of the ninth anniversary of the signing of the great Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance, cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Chongqing enthusiastically launched celebration activities, and people from all walks of life cheered for the unbreakable unity and friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.

    首都隆重庆祝中苏同盟九周年
    上海天津广州重庆等地热烈展开庆祝活动
    新华社13日讯　中苏友好协会总会和北京市中苏友好协会今天晚间在天桥剧场举行晚会，隆重热烈地庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订九周年。
    在充满兄弟友谊气氛的晚会上，中苏两国的同志们一致欢庆苏联发展国民经济七年计划在全人类面前架起一座向共产主义过渡的桥梁，热烈祝贺无敌于天下的中苏同盟坚如钢铁，恒如日月，祝贺中苏两国人民的深厚友谊万古长青。
    庆祝晚会在七时开始。在主席台上入座的有陈毅副总理、中苏友好协会总会副会长吴玉章、沈钧儒、黄炎培、刘宁一、廖承志、李德全、沈雁冰，秘书长钱俊瑞，中共中央委员、监察部部长、中国劳动人民庆祝十月革命四十一周年赴苏观礼团副团长钱瑛，北京市中苏友好协会会长邓拓、副会长杨勇，外交部副部长曾涌泉。
    在主席台上就座的有苏联驻中国临时代办安东诺夫，商务代表叶烈敏、参赞苏达利柯夫。
    出席庆祝晚会的有：中苏友好协会总会副会长李四光、马寅初、邵力子、李烛尘，理事史良、陈叔通、蔡廷锴、萧华、萧劲光、张奚若。出席庆祝晚会的还有各部门的负责人和首都各界群众的代表。
    出席庆祝晚会的还有各兄弟国家的驻华使节，在京的部分苏联专家。应邀来我国访问的苏联人民演员、爱沙尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国人民演员齐特·库乌济克和塔林国立音乐学院钢琴伴奏者塔尔西娜·阿兰格也出席了晚会。
    庆祝晚会由吴玉章主持。吴玉章致词说：“我们今天在这里集会，正好是中苏两国喜事重重的时候。苏联共产党在不久之前胜利举行了二十一次代表大会，并通过了建设共产主义的宏伟的七年计划。2月7日，中苏两国政府又在莫斯科签订了关于进一步扩大中苏两国间的经济合作的协定。我们每个人都为这些振奋人心的大喜事感到非常的高兴。让我们大家一起为苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的胜利闭幕，为苏联建设共产主义的宏伟纲领，为中苏两国的友好团结的更进一步的发展和巩固，为中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的九周年而欢呼！让我们向在座的全体苏联同志，向伟大的兄弟般的苏联人民表示衷心的热烈的祝贺。”
    中苏友好协会总会副秘书长戈宝权宣读了中苏友好协会总会会长宋庆龄致苏中友好协会理事会主席安德烈耶夫的贺电。
    接着钱瑛发表了讲话。她说：“我们每年都以极其兴奋愉快的心情来庆祝这个伟大的节日。但是，参加今天这个庆祝会，我们特别感到无比的兴奋和愉快，因为最近一段时期，对于我们说来，真是喜事重重。”
    她紧接着说，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会是当代政治生活中的一件大事，具有伟大的历史意义。四十多年前，苏联共产党领导着人民为全人类打开了通向社会主义的道路。今天，苏联共产党提出的七年计划，又在全人类面前架起了一座向共产主义过渡的桥梁。
    钱瑛谈她去年访苏的观感时，热烈赞颂苏联各方面建设的巨大胜利和苏联始终不渝地奉行的和平外交政策。她还说，我们深信，在以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏共中央的正确领导下，英雄的苏联人民一定能够胜利地完成七年计划，沿着共产主义的道路取得更加伟大的胜利。
    钱瑛讲到伟大的中苏同盟时说：“中苏两国的同盟，就是保卫和平的同盟。九年来，中苏两国肩并肩地团结一致，相互支持，为世界和平事业作出了巨大的贡献。我们非常高兴地看到，中苏两国之间的团结已经愈来愈巩固了，两国的全面合作已经愈来愈亲密了。这种团结和合作不但是促进我们两国繁荣的有力因素，而且是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结的重要部分，是世界和平与人类进步事业的最可靠的保证。”
    钱瑛指出：在庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约九周年时，我们中国人民衷心地感谢苏联政府和苏联人民对于我国社会主义建设事业的伟大的无私的援助。
    钱瑛列举事实说：“苏联曾经多次供给我国条件极为优惠的贷款，供应了我国大批现代化设备和其他工农业建设物资，帮助我国建设一系列对我国工业化有重要作用的大型工业企业，通过各种方式帮助我国提高科学技术水平。来我国帮助建设的苏联专家，对我国的建设事业无保留地贡献出自己的丰富的科学技术知识与全副精力。去年我国社会主义建设大跃进以来，苏联对我国的支援格外加强了。我们在苏联访问时，亲眼看到不少工厂企业为中国赶制设备，那里的职工都把支援中国建设当作切身的光荣的事业。我们还看到苏联人民像培养自己的子弟一样为中国培养建设人才，成百成千的中国留学生和实习生，受到了苏联老师、同学和职工弟兄们的亲切关怀和热情帮助。”
    钱瑛还说，最近中苏又签订了进一步扩大两国间经济合作的协定。这个协定是苏联人民对我国人民的又一次伟大的国际主义援助，它对于我国顺利实现国民经济计划具有极其重大的作用。
    钱瑛强调说：“中苏两国的友谊是两个社会主义兄弟之邦的友谊，我们这种以无产阶级国际主义原则为基础的友谊是永恒的、牢不可破的。以美国为首的帝国主义者和南斯拉夫现代修正主义者用了一切卑鄙手段，妄想在中苏两国之间发现和制造所谓‘分歧’，这只能说明他们的日暮途穷，心劳日拙。”
    钱瑛最后说：“中国人民一向像爱护自己眼珠一样爱护中苏两国人民的伟大友谊，永远把加强我们两国的团结看作自己神圣的国际主义义务。中国人民将和苏联人民永远站在一起，为人类的美好未来，为我们的共同事业的胜利而不懈地奋斗。”
  在热烈的掌声中安东诺夫登台讲话，他首先说，我以苏联大使馆和在座的全体苏联同志的名义，对中苏友好协会总会和北京市中苏友好协会组织的这次晚会表示深切的感谢。我在这里对有利于我们两国人民和世界和平的伟大的苏中友谊的进一步发展表示热烈的祝贺。安东诺夫接着宣读了苏中友好协会理事会主席安德烈耶夫致中苏友好协会总会会长宋庆龄的贺电。
    吴玉章、钱瑛和安东诺夫的讲话不断获得全场同志的热烈掌声。
    晚会上，首都文艺工作者演出了音乐、舞蹈等精彩节目。苏联来宾齐特·库乌济克和塔尔西娜·阿兰格也应邀参加表演，受到与会者的热烈欢迎。晚会结束时，到会同志全体起立，热烈鼓掌，高唱“莫斯科—北京”歌。
