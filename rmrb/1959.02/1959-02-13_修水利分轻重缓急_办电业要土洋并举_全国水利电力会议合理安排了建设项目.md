Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 12th: The Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric Power recently convened a National Water Conservancy and Electric Power Conference in Tianjin. In accordance with the spirit of the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the conference determined to continue to exert all-out efforts, strive for the upper reaches, and carry out water conservancy and electric power construction in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. More than 400 representatives from water conservancy and electric power systems in 27 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions attended the conference.

    The conference pointed out that China's electric power industry had made great leaps forward last year, with newly added power generation equipment increasing by 1.4 times compared to 1957, equivalent to more than two-thirds of the newly added equipment during the First Five-Year Plan. However, due to the overall leap forward of the national economy, the growth rate of electricity still cannot meet the needs of the rapid growth of industry and other fields. After analyzing this situation, the conference exchanged experiences on ensuring quality and accelerating power construction from design and construction to installation and operation, and determined measures for the electric power industry to leap forward at a faster pace.

    The conference summarized the achievements of water conservancy construction in 1958. Last year, a total of 58 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work were completed nationwide, expanding the irrigated area by 480 million mu, initially controlling waterlogging in an area of 210 million mu, and controlling soil erosion in an area of 300,000 square kilometers. On the basis of extensively carrying out small-scale projects, the masses completed more than 3,300 medium-sized projects, and the state invested in the construction or continuation of more than 540 large-scale projects. Relying on the projects built in previous years, especially last year, coupled with the heroic struggle of the masses in fighting drought and flood, the damage from drought and flood was greatly reduced, and the extraordinary floods of the Yellow River and Han River were overcome, ensuring the great leap forward in agriculture last year. Based on the achievements and experience of 1958, the conference determined that the guiding principle for water conservancy construction this year is to first carry out projects in areas with relatively serious water and drought disasters, and then projects in general areas; first carry out projects that are critical to solving water and drought disasters, and then secondary projects; first carry out projects that are dangerous during the flood season, and then projects that are not dangerous during the flood season. At the same time, the conference required all localities to give full play to the benefits of existing and newly built projects, strengthen flood control work, and gradually achieve the goal of preventing disasters from heavy rains and ensuring bumper harvests without rain.

    According to the unified plan formulated by the state and the manpower and material resources of various localities, the conference made reasonable arrangements for water conservancy and electric power basic construction projects, prioritizing them based on importance and urgency. For the projects that have been arranged, the conference required all localities to exert the greatest efforts, mobilize and rely on the masses, carry out technical revolution, and strive to complete them as soon as possible while ensuring quality. The conference also required all localities to continue to emancipate their minds, break superstitions, and adhere to the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and walking on two legs in design work, so as to ensure quality and save raw materials; in the construction process, it is also necessary to rely on the masses to establish and improve some necessary responsibility systems to strengthen construction management. At the same time, it is necessary to give play to the spirit of self-reliance and vigorously carry out tool reform, and in solving the difficulties of construction machinery and tools, try to use local materials as much as possible to reduce the supply of cement and steel. The conference also required all localities to continue to carry forward the communist spirit of cooperation, support and adjust each other in terms of technical strength, equipment and materials, and make a common leap forward.

    The conference analyzed the characteristics of heavy electric power production tasks in 1959, many new equipment, and many new workers, and required all localities to implement the overall concept of safe production, strengthen training work, actively prepare for the power generation of new equipment; strengthen maintenance work, improve maintenance quality, implement technical operating procedures and safety work procedures, and carry out mass movements centered on safe production; vigorously carry out technical revolution and strive to generate and supply more electricity.

    The conference exchanged the experiences of Liaoning, Shandong, and other regions in developing electricity through "small indigenous groups." The conference believed that establishing large and foreign power stations and manufacturing large and foreign power generation equipment as the backbone of the electric power industry was necessary in the past and will be necessary in the future. However, according to the electricity requirements of the national economic plan and the electricity requirements of urban and rural areas, large and foreign power stations alone cannot meet the needs, and it is also necessary to carry out the mass movement of "small indigenous groups" to develop electricity.

    The conference required all localities to strengthen the long-term development planning and scientific research of water conservancy and electric power.

    修水利分轻重缓急
    办电业要土洋并举
    全国水利电力会议合理安排了建设项目
    新华社天津12日电　水利电力部最近在天津召开了全国水利电力会议。会议根据党的八届六中全会决议的精神，确定继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地进行水利电力建设。出席这次会议的，有二十七个省、市、自治区水利电力系统的代表共四百多人。
    会议指出，我国电力工业在去年有了很大的跃进，新增的发电设备比1957年增加一点四倍，相当于第一个五年计划新增设备的三分之二以上。但是由于国民经济的全面跃进，电力增长的速度仍然不能满足工业及其他方面的急剧增长的需要。会议分析了这一情况以后，互相交流了从设计、施工到安装、运行等保证质量、加速电力建设的经验，并且确定了电力工业以更快步伐向前跃进的措施。
    会议总结了1958年水利建设的成就。去年来全国共完成土石方工程量五百八十亿公方，扩大灌溉面积四亿八千万亩，初步治理洼涝面积二亿一千万亩，控制水土流失面积三十万平方公里，在广泛开展小型工程的基础上，依靠群众完成的中型工程共三千三百多项，由国家投资新办或续办的大型工程共五百四十多项。依靠历年特别是去年所修的工程，再加上群众在抗旱防汛中的英勇斗争，大大减轻了旱涝灾害，并且战胜了黄河和汉江的特大洪水，保证了去年农业的大跃进。会议根据1958年的成就和经验，确定今年水利建设的方针是，先搞水旱灾害比较严重地区的工程，后搞一般地区的工程；先搞对解决水旱灾害带关键性的工程，后搞次要工程；先搞汛期有危险的工程，后搞汛期无危险的工程。同时，会议要求各地应当充分发挥已有和新建工程的效益，并且加强防汛工作，逐步做到大雨不成灾、无雨保丰收。
    会议根据国家拟定的统一计划和各地人力、物力的情况，分别轻重缓急，把水利电力基本建设工程项目进行了合理安排。对于已安排的项目，会议要求各地都拿出最大的干劲，发动和依靠群众，开展技术革命，在保证质量的前提下，力争尽快完成。会议还要求各地在设计工作中继续解放思想，破除迷信，坚持土洋并举、两条腿走路的方针，作到既保证质量，又节约原材料；在施工过程中，也必须依靠群众建立和健全一些必要的责任制，以加强施工管理。同时要发挥自力更生的精神，大搞工具改革，在解决施工机具的困难中，要尽量就地取材，以减少水泥钢材的供应量。会议还要求各地继续发扬共产主义的协作精神，在技术力量、设备器材等方面互相支援，互相调剂，共同跃进。
    会议分析了1959年电业生产任务繁重、新设备多、新工人多的特点，要求各地必须贯彻安全生产的全面思想，加强培训工作，积极作好新设备发电的准备工作；加强检修工作，提高检修质量，贯彻技术操作规程和安全工作规程，开展以安全生产为中心的群众运动；大闹技术革命，争取多发电多供电。
    会议交流了辽宁、山东等地区开展“小土群”办电的经验。会议认为，建立大、洋电站，制造大、洋发电设备，做为电力工业的骨干力量，过去是必要的，今后也是必要的。但根据国民经济计划的用电要求和城镇、农村的用电要求，光有大洋电站还不能满足需要，还必须开展“小土群”的全民办电运动。
    会议要求各地加强水利电力远景发展规划工作和科学研究工作。
