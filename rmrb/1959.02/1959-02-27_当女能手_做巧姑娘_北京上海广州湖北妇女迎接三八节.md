Beijing News: Beijing women from all walks of life are taking practical actions in the Great Leap Forward to welcome this year's International Women's Day on March 8th.

Last night, Beijing held a Great Leap Forward broadcast rally for women from all walks of life, attended by 600,000 women. Wang Chunping, Deputy Director of the Beijing Women's Federation, called on all women in the city to continue to exert their efforts and strive for excellence on the basis of the 1958 Great Leap Forward, actively labor, and improve their awareness, to complete and overfulfill this year's construction plan, and to greet their festival with more outstanding production and work achievements, and dedicate them to the festival. At the broadcast rally, representatives of women from the No. 2 Branch of the North China Radio Equipment Factory, the Hualu Mulan Workshop of the Chongwen District Fur No. 3 Factory, Wangfu Food Store, the "Five Sisters" Dining Hall of Mentougou People's Commune, and Beixiaojie Kindergarten reported their work achievements to the conference and put forward plans for a greater leap forward in production and work this year. Many women who listened to the broadcast rally outside the venue also wrote letters of determination on the spot or called the Municipal Women's Federation to express their determination.

In recent days, many factories and street women in the capital have launched gift-giving week activities. Female workers in factories such as the Beijing No. 2 Machine Tool Factory and the Xicheng District Civilian Lighting Factory are rushing to produce several new products as gifts for "March 8th". During the gift-giving week, the Bian Guirong team of the Canvas Products Factory increased its daily production of canvas clothing from 53 sets to 64 sets, and the Zhang Shuying team increased its daily production of shoulder pads from 30 to 35 to 60. The women of the Dongcheng District Hepingli Red Flag Carton Processing Factory, run by housewives, have improved four kinds of tools and operating methods in a few days. Street women from the Chaoyang Street Office in Chaoyang District have accumulated 3 million catties of fertilizer by using their lunch break every day.

The production enthusiasm of women in rural areas in the suburbs is getting higher and higher. More than 100 women from units such as the Dongfeng Wheat Professional Team of the Zhongde Friendship People's Commune in Chaoyang District carried out a high-yield day to welcome "March 8th" from February 15th to 17th, with an average of 30,000 catties of fertilizer accumulated per woman.

Female employees in commercial and service industries, as well as nursery workers and female teachers, have also set higher demands on themselves.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 26th: Shanghai women are taking various practical actions to welcome International Women's Day on March 8th.

Female workers on the industrial front have widely launched a hot wave of competition to catch up with each other, make a big fuss about technological revolution, and improve labor productivity. More than 200,000 female textile workers in the city have launched a movement to "learn from skilled workers, catch up with skilled workers, and learn to be all-rounders". Female weaving workers in the State-owned No. 8 Cotton Mill proposed to increase the number of yarn joints per minute to 24, catching up with the famous labor model Huang Baomei; Huang Baomei, upon hearing this, proposed a new indicator, and the number of yarn joints per minute has reached 25. Female technicians from various units are determined to design more new products to welcome their festival. All the female technicians in the Second Product Design Office of the Ninth Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building are using their spare time to design a 900-horsepower tugboat, striving to launch it on "March 8th" and name it "March 8th Women's".

Female medical staff throughout the city are actively learning traditional Chinese medicine, and some female doctors have initially mastered the clinical treatment methods of traditional Chinese medicine. Female medical staff at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital affiliated with the First Medical College have initially learned to prescribe traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions and plan to summarize a set of experiences in learning traditional Chinese medicine before "March 8th". Female medical staff at the China Welfare Association Maternity and Child Health Hospital have written a "Street Women's Health Manual" as a gift for "March 8th", and also plan to conduct a general treatment and re-examination of cervical cancer patients in the area where the hospital is located before "March 8th".

Educational workers and childcare workers throughout the city have proposed to ensure that children are well cared for and educated, and to welcome "March 8th" with practical actions.

Neighborhood women who have been organized to participate in production have also set off a red flag competition upsurge of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. Many street women, in conjunction with cleaning and sanitation work, actively explore fertilizer sources and collect fertilizers to send to rural people's communes. Female commune members in suburban people's communes are more actively engaged in the fertilizer accumulation movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 25th: Guangzhou women are widely carrying out the "Skilled Women" movement, with everyone learning skills and showing talents, to welcome the upcoming International Women's Day on March 8th with production and work achievements.

Female workers on the industrial front are carrying out the "Skilled Women" movement, focusing on making a big fuss about technological revolution, attacking the raw material barrier and the equipment barrier. Female workers in the Zhuoya squad of the Guanghua Printing and Dyeing Factory have worked hard to learn technology in the movement. Many of the procedures that used to be done by two people can now be undertaken by one person, greatly improving work efficiency. In the past, they could only dye an average of eight to nine pieces of cloth per person per day, but now they have increased to an average of eleven pieces of cloth per person per day.

Female employees in the commercial sector are also actively striving to become skilled in management and service. Female employees of the Zhongshan Fifth Road Department Store actively improve cooperation in the movement. When the food and soap counters are busy, the female salespersons at the hardware counter help pack things. Female employees of the Nanhua Hotel vigorously improve the quality of service, and have set up customer lounges, temporary nurseries, and maternal and infant dining rooms in the hotel, which have been praised by customers.

Female staff on the cultural, educational, and health fronts are also working hard to improve their business and strive to become "skilled women". Female medical staff at the Red Cross Hospital proposed to be "proficient in one specialty and capable in many", and in addition to further improving their business, they also want to master other skills, such as laboratory testing, hairdressing, and acupuncture.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 25th: Rural women in Hubei Province are widely launching a "Three Million Bumper Harvest Girls and Clever Girls" movement to promote the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1959 and welcome "March 8th".

The "Three Million Girls" movement in Hubei Province is being carried out on the basis of the "Million Girls" movement in the province last year. Anyone who meets the requirements for high-yield bumper harvests, or is both literate and martial, both red and expert, and has achievements in technological innovation, can be awarded the title of "Bumper Harvest Girl" or "Clever Girl". Last year, more than two million bumper harvest girls and more than 90,000 clever girls emerged in the province. The women also planted more than 1.8 million mu of experimental fields, which played an important role in promoting the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture.

In order to realize a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1959 and welcome the arrival of "March 8th", the Hubei Provincial Women's Federation recently proposed to carry out the "Three Million Girls" movement in the province. It called on women throughout the province to plant experimental fields, learn agricultural technology, master the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, run collective welfare undertakings well, and set off a socialist competition upsurge of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and being the advanced throughout the province.

Women throughout the province warmly responded to the call of the Provincial Women's Federation. Now, production competitions are being carried out between special districts, counties, communes, production teams, and between commune members. (Attached pictures)

    北京上海广州湖北妇女迎接三八节
    本报讯　北京各界妇女正以大跃进的实际行动迎接今年“三八”国际妇女节。
    昨晚，北京举行了有六十万名妇女收听的各界妇女跃进广播大会，北京市妇女联合会副主任王春平号召全市妇女在1958年大跃进的基础上继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，积极劳动，提高觉悟，为完成和超额完成今年的建设计划而努力，用更出色的生产、工作成绩来迎接自己的节日，向节日献礼。在广播大会上，华北无线电器材厂第二分厂、崇文区皮毛三厂花木兰车间、王府食品商店、门头沟人民公社“五姊妹”食堂、北小街幼儿园等单位的妇女代表，都向大会报告了自己的工作成绩，提出今年生产、工作更大跃进的规划。在会外收听广播的许多妇女也当场写决心书或给市妇联打电话表示决心。
    连日来，首都许多工厂、街道妇女展开献礼周活动。北京市第二机床厂、西城区民用灯具厂等厂的女工们正在赶制几件新产品，作为向“三八”献礼。在献礼周中，帆布制品厂女工边桂荣小组由过去每天生产帆布服五十三套提高到六十四套，张淑英小组由过去每天生产垫肩三十到三十五个提高到六十个。由家庭妇女办起来的东城区和平里红旗纸盒加工厂妇女几天内就改进了四种工具和操作方法。朝阳区朝阳街办事处的街道妇女利用每天中午时间已积肥三百万斤。
    郊区农村妇女们的生产热情越来越高。朝阳区中德友好人民公社东风小麦专业队等单位的一百多名妇女，在2月15日到17日的三天中，开展迎“三八”高产日，平均每个妇女积肥达三万斤。
    商业、服务性行业的女职工及保育员、女教师等也都向自己提出了更高的要求。
    新华社上海26日电　上海市妇女以各种实际行动迎接“三八”国际妇女节。
    工业战线上的女职工们，已广泛地掀起了你追我赶，大闹技术革命，提高劳动生产率的竞赛热潮。全市二十多万纺织女工展开了“学能手，赶能手，学习多面手”的运动。国棉八厂的挡车女工提出，要把每分钟接头的根数增加到二十四根，赶上著名劳动模范黄宝妹；黄宝妹闻讯后又提出新的指标，每分钟接头已达到二十五根。各单位女技术人员们，决心以设计更多的新产品来迎接自己的节日。第一机械工业部第九局第二产品设计室全体女技术人员，利用业余时间设计了一艘九百匹马力的拖轮，争取在“三八”节那天下水，命名为“三八妇女号”。
    全市女医务人员在积极地学习祖国医学，有些女医生已经初步掌握了中医的临床治疗方法。第一医学院附属妇产科医院的女医务人员，初步学会了中医开方，并打算在“三八”节以前总结出一套学习中医的经验。中国福利会妇幼保健院的女医务人员，为了向“三八”节献礼写成了一本“地段妇女保健手册”，另外还打算在“三八”节以前把医院所在地区的子宫颈癌患者进行一次普遍的治疗和复查。
    全市教育工作者、保育工作者纷纷提出保证把孩子带好、教育好，以实际行动迎接“三八”节。
    已经组织起来参加生产的里弄妇女，也掀起了学先进、比先进、赶先进的红旗竞赛热潮。许多街道妇女结合清洁卫生工作，积极挖掘肥源，收集肥料，送给农村人民公社。郊区人民公社的女社员们更加积极地投入积肥运动。
    据新华社广州25日电　广州市妇女正在广泛开展“女能手”运动，人人学本领，显才能，以生产和工作成绩迎接即将到来的“三八”国际妇女节。
    工业战线上的女职工，围绕着大闹技术革命、猛攻原料关和设备关等工作，开展“女能手”运动。广华印染厂卓娅排的女工在运动中努力学习技术，许多原来由两个人做的工序，现在一个人就可以担任起来，大大提高了工作效率。她们过去每人每天平均只能染布八匹到九匹，现在已提高到每人每天平均染布十一匹。
    商业部门的女职工也积极争取成为经营和服务方面的能手。中山五路百货商店的女职工在运动中主动搞好协作关系，当食品、肥皂等柜工作忙的时候，五金柜的女售货员就去帮助包东西。南华饭店的女职工大力改进服务质量，在饭店内设立顾客休息室、临时托婴室、妇婴餐室等，受到顾客的赞扬。
    文教卫生战线上的女工作人员，也在努力提高业务，争取当“女能手”。红十字会医院的女医护人员提出要“一专多能”，除进一步提高自己的业务外，还要掌握其他本领，如化验、理发、针灸等。
    据新华社武汉25日电　湖北省农村妇女正在广泛展开一个“三百万丰产姑娘和巧姑娘”运动，以促进1959年农业生产大跃进的实际行动，来迎接“三八”节。
    湖北省的“三百万姑娘”运动是在去年全省“百万姑娘”运动的基础上开展起来的。凡是达到了高额丰产要求的生产能手，或是能文能武、又红又专、在技术革新方面有成绩的多面手，都可以得到“丰产姑娘”或“巧姑娘”的称号。去年全省出现了二百多万个丰产姑娘和九万多个巧姑娘。妇女们还种了一百八十多万亩试验田，在促进工农业大跃进中起了重要的作用。
    为了实现1959年工农业生产更大的跃进和迎接“三八”节的到来，湖北省妇女联合会最近提出了在全省开展“三百万姑娘”运动。号召全省妇女大种试验田，学习农业技术，掌握农业“八字宪法”，办好集体福利事业，在全省范围内掀起一个学先进、赶先进、当先进的社会主义竞赛高潮。
    全省妇女热烈响应省妇联的号召。现在，各专、县、社、生产队以及社员与社员之间，正在展开生产竞赛。（附图片）
