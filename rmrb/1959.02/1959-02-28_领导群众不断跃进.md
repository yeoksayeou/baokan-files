Leading the Masses in Continuous Leaps Forward
E Wen

Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the people of Guanghua County, Hubei Province, have made the entire rural production leap forward year after year and are now fighting with full confidence to achieve even greater leaps forward.

The natural conditions of Guanghua County are not good, but very bad, and there is also a severe shortage of labor. It has always been a low-yield agricultural area, and the industrial base is even weaker. Therefore, the fact that Guanghua County has been making leaps forward year after year is more meaningful for many regions. Because, on a national scale, the number of counties with conditions better than or roughly the same as Guanghua County is not small, but the majority.

Since the natural conditions of Guanghua County are so bad, why has it been able to make leaps forward year after year, making the entire countryside a scene of renewal? The most fundamental factor is that the broad masses of the county have fully exerted their subjective initiative and waged an unyielding struggle against various unfavorable conditions with soaring energy. The key to their ability to do this lies in the fact that the Party organizations at all levels there have correctly implemented the mass line working method when leading rural production, mobilizing the masses' great power to conquer nature.

The soaring energy of the cadres and masses of Guanghua County includes both hard work and clever work. They conscientiously improve labor organization, rationally arrange various tasks, and constantly reform production tools, using these means to save labor and improve labor efficiency, making one laborer do the work of three in the past. As everyone knows, in the past, the countryside basically only engaged in agriculture and not industry, and agriculture mainly produced grain, cotton, and oil crops. Now, the production policy of the people's communes is to simultaneously promote industry and agriculture, simultaneously promote self-sufficient production and commodity production, and comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. This means that the tasks of rural production are much more arduous and difficult than in the past, and the problem of insufficient rural labor is therefore more prominent. The methods adopted by Guanghua County to solve this problem are correct and can be widely promoted.

The masses have endless wisdom and power. With the leadership of the Party and the determination and methods of hard work and clever work, the broad masses will surely create great achievements. Party organizations should strengthen leadership and launch large-scale mass movements. In this regard, Guanghua County also has many practices that are worthy of attention. When they use the method of inserting red flags to mobilize the masses, they always constantly discover and commend new advanced units, making the mass movement continue to rise; they always persistently educate the masses to look forward, continuously revolutionize, and continuously leap forward. These practices are in line with the laws of development of things. Therefore, they can correctly and powerfully guide the struggle.

We hope that the experience of Guanghua County will blossom and bear fruit in more places.

    领导群众不断跃进
    鄂文
    湖北省光化县人民在各级党委的领导下，已经使整个农村生产连年跃进，目前正在满怀信心地为实现更大跃进而斗争。
    光化县的自然条件不是很好而是很不好，同时劳动力也很缺乏，历来就是农业低产区，工业基础更是薄弱得很，因此光化县连年跃进的事实对许许多多地区来说，就显得更有意义。因为就全国范围看来，各方面条件比光化县好或者大体上同它相当的县，不是少数而是多数。
    既然光化县的自然条件那样不好，那末它为什么能够连年跃进，使得整个农村已经万象更新了呢？最基本的因素，是这个县的广大群众充分发挥了主观能动性，以冲天的干劲向各种不利的条件进行了百折不挠的斗争。他们能够作到这一点，关键又在于那里的各级党组织在领导农村生产的时候，正确地贯彻了群众路线的工作方法，发动了群众争服自然的巨大的力量。
    光化县干部和群众的冲天干劲，是包含着苦干和巧干两个内容的。他们认真地改善劳动组织，合理地安排各项工作，不断地改革生产工具，通过这些途径来节约劳动力和提高劳动效率，已经作到一个劳动力顶过去三个劳动力用。大家知道，过去在农村中基本上是只搞农业不搞工业的，而搞农业也主要是生产粮食、棉花和油料作物。现在，人民公社的生产方针是工业和农业同时并举，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举，农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展。这就是说，农村生产的任务较过去繁重得多、艰巨得多，而农村劳动力不足的问题也因此表现得更突出了。光化县为解决这个问题所采取的方法是正确的，可以普遍推行。
    群众有无穷无尽的智慧和力量。广大群众有了党的领导，有了苦干、巧干的决心和办法，就一定能创造巨大的成绩。党的组织应该加强领导，大搞群众运动。在这方面，光化县也有许多作法值得重视。他们在运用插红旗的方法来发动群众的时候，总是不断地发现和表扬新的先进单位，使群众运动不断高涨；他们总是坚持不懈地教育群众向前看，不断革命，不断跃进。这些作法，都是符合事物的发展规律的。因此，就能够正确地有力地指导斗争。
    我们希望光化县的经验在更多的地方开花结果。
