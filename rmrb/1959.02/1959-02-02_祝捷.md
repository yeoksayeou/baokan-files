Editor's Note

    Congratulations on Victory
    In the past few days, we have successively published news of many regions and enterprises completing their January plans ahead of schedule, and there are even more regions and enterprises that have overfulfilled their plans ahead of schedule, which have not been published in the newspaper. Facing such a vigorous and prosperous scene, who can not be excited and cheer for it?
    The comrades of the Beijing Liulihe Cement Plant put forward a very good leap forward slogan: "Good start, red every day, red every ten days, red to the bottom of the river." They have realized this slogan, completing the January plan four days ahead of schedule. We hope that the Liulihe Cement Plant and all enterprises in the country will not only have a good start and be red every day, but also be red every month and red to the end of the year. As newspaper editors, we are even more willing and looking forward to: reporting victories every month, congratulating victories every month, reporting to the end, and congratulating to the end!

    祝捷
    几天来，我们接连发表了很多地区和企业提前完成1月份计划的消息，还有更多的地区和企业提前超额完成了计划，没有在报纸上登出来。面对着这样蓬蓬勃勃的兴旺景象，有谁能不激动、不为之欢呼雀跃呢？
    北京琉璃河水泥厂的职工同志们提出了一个很好的跃进口号：“开门红、日日红、旬旬红、红到河底。”他们实现了这个口号，1月份提前四天完成了计划。我们愿琉璃河水泥厂和全国所有的企业，不仅开门红、日日红，而且月月红，一年红到底。作为报纸的编辑工作者，我们更愿意，并且盼望着：月月报捷，月月祝捷，报到底，祝到底！
