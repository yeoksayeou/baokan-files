Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: According to TASS, a government delegation from the Republic of Iraq arrived in Moscow by plane on the 25th. The delegation is here to discuss and sign an agreement on economic and technical cooperation between the two countries with the Soviet government.

    The head of the delegation, Minister of Economy of the Republic of Iraq, Ibrahim Kubba, said in a speech at the airport that he hoped to have effective cooperation with the Soviet side. He said that despite our different social systems, we have so far cooperated well with the Soviet Union in the cause of defending world peace. Our enemy is one, and that is imperialism. Our front is one, and that is the front of all peoples fighting to defend world peace.

    Kuzmin, Chairman of the Soviet State Planning Committee, who greeted the delegation at the airport, said in his welcoming speech that we are happy to welcome the first government delegation from the fraternal and friendly Republic of Iraq to visit our country. The Soviet people pay close attention to and sympathize with the heroic struggle of the freedom-loving Iraqi people against imperialism, to eliminate the serious consequences of colonialism and anti-people systems, and to consolidate Iraq's independence and comprehensively develop the national economy. We are pleased to note that the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries are being consolidated and developed day by day.

    Kuzmin expressed his belief that the visit of the Iraqi government delegation will make a new contribution to strengthening Soviet-Iraqi friendly relations, and that the talks will achieve good results.

    On the same day, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Mikoyan, received Ibrahim Kubba and members of the delegation at the Kremlin and had a warm and friendly conversation with them.

    On the 26th, the delegation paid a visit to Skachkov, Chairman of the State Committee of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union for Foreign Economic Relations.
