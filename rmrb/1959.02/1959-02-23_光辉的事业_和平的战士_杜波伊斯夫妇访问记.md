    A Glorious Career, A Warrior for Peace
    —A Visit with the Du Bois Couple
    By Our Correspondent Yu Minsheng
      "Although I have never had the opportunity to contact and understand the great Chinese people, I have felt very close to them since childhood. They and I are true brothers. Today, I am overjoyed to see them rise to their rightful place in the world," the famous American black scholar and World Peace Council member Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois wrote in a letter to Vice-Chairwoman Soong Ching Ling in July last year.
    More than half a year later, Dr. Du Bois and his wife, Shirley Graham, have come to China as guests. When we visited this elderly couple at the Beijing Hotel, they repeatedly expressed that they could not express their joy after coming to China.
    Dr. Du Bois, who is already ninety-one years old, has lost much of his hair, and his long beard has also turned white, but he is still strong and radiant. When we asked him what he would like to convey to the Chinese people, the black scholar excitedly said: "My wife and I send greetings to the Chinese people, and congratulate them, wishing them greater achievements in the future. We bring the good intentions of 18 million black people in America."
    The bright sunshine streamed through the glass windows into this quiet reception room, making people feel exceptionally warm. The deeper our conversation went, the more we felt how deep this American black leader's friendship with the Chinese people was. In 1950, Dr. Du Bois clearly pointed out that the United States "must coexist with the Soviet Union and China in one world," and he strongly opposed the U.S. government's support for Chiang Kai-shek. In 1952, in response to a letter from 120 leaders in South America regarding participation in the American Continent Peace Conference, he wrote: "Our only hope is to hold such a conference to awaken peace-loving people in the world, to awaken the bound workers to ensure peace, reform industry, and distribute wealth fairly rather than through deception, theft, gambling, etc., so that progressive people in North and South America can stand together with socialist Europe, communist Soviet Union, and liberated China to form a just world." In 1955, Dr. Du Bois also wrote to the editors of all American newspapers, condemning the United States' open aggression on the Taiwan issue.
    The ninety-one-year-old scholar told us that he had visited China for a short time as early as 1936. After the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, he had always wanted to visit New China, but the U.S. State Department did not give him a passport, so he could not come. After overcoming numerous obstacles and obtaining a passport to travel abroad last year, he wrote to Vice-Chairwoman Soong Ching Ling expressing his hope to visit China. Now his wish has finally come true.
    Throughout our visit, Mrs. Shirley Graham was always talking and laughing, appearing so happy. She is a famous American writer, a member of the World Peace Council, and a member of the National Committee of the American-Soviet Friendship Association. It was this sixty-year-old lady who, not long ago, represented Dr. Du Bois at the All-African People's Conference, and together with the wife of American black singer Paul Robeson, personally tore down the Kuomintang's so-called "national flag," striking a blow against the U.S. government's conspiracy to create "two Chinas." When we expressed our gratitude for her righteous act, she described the scene to us. At that time, the Kuomintang's so-called "national flag" was raised at the meeting, and the representatives of New China refused to attend the conference. The U.S. government's conspiracy to create "two Chinas" aroused people's anger. Mrs. Shirley Graham and Mrs. Robeson tore down the Kuomintang's so-called "national flag," which represented darkness and humiliation, and threw it out of the venue...
      "At the All-African People's Conference, visiting China was just a dream, but today this dream has become a reality!" Mrs. Shirley Graham laughed heartily.
    Our topic shifted from friendship to the American black liberation movement. Dr. Du Bois introduced the history of the American black liberation movement to us in detail. He said: "Historically, the American black liberation movement has never stopped."
    "Historically, it has always been said that the United States is liberating black people, but this is not true. In fact, black people are liberating themselves," Dr. Du Bois emphasized.
    "In the southern United States, millions upon millions of black people are deprived of their right to vote. The vast majority of black people cannot receive education in the same schools as white people. Black people are objects of enslavement and exploitation, and they have lost their basic rights to life." Dr. Du Bois's words aroused our deep sympathy for the plight of black people in the United States.
    Dr. Du Bois confidently expressed to us: "The struggle of black people in America will surely be victorious, and we will surely obtain our equal rights." He also said: "The existence of the Soviet Union and China is very beneficial to our struggle. This makes our opponents afraid to use force openly against us as they did in the past."
    Mrs. Shirley Graham specifically introduced Dr. Du Bois's life to us. Since the 19th century, Dr. Du Bois has been a leader of the American black masses fighting for democratic rights. His contributions to American science and literature, his efforts to safeguard and fight for the democratic rights of people of color, and his efforts to defend world peace have always been praised and respected by just public opinion around the world.
    Long after graduating from middle school, Dr. Du Bois saw the oppression of black people and their miserable and impoverished lives in the southern United States... All this made the young Du Bois determined to fight for the liberation of black people. After studying in Germany in 1892, Du Bois traveled to Central Europe for a year. He saw that many people's lives were very difficult, which made him realize that oppressed people were not just black people in the United States, but everywhere in the world. Since then, his field of thought has become broader. For the past six or seventy years, he has been committed to the black liberation struggle in the United States. In order to understand the lives of black people, he once lived in black slums with his wife and children and lived with black people. He wrote many books on black issues, encouraging black people to fight for their liberation. He called on all black people in the United States to accuse their unfortunate experiences, resolutely demand full voting rights, abolish the racial discrimination system, and demand social freedom and equality before the law with white people. Dr. Du Bois is one of the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
    During World War I, Dr. Du Bois went to Europe to understand the situation of black soldiers, which made him discover that the American black problem and the African problem were actually one problem. So he went to Paris to initiate and convene the first Pan-African Congress. Since 1918, the Pan-African Congress has been held five times. The All-African People's Conference held in Accra, Ghana last year was actually the sixth meeting of the Pan-African Congress. Dr. Du Bois told us: "Black people in the United States are very concerned about African affairs because Africa is their motherland." This shows Dr. Du Bois's deep feelings for Africans.
    What is admirable is that although Dr. Du Bois has been unreasonably persecuted by the U.S. government many times, he has persistently and unyieldingly actively participated in the struggle for democratic freedom and world peace. In the past ten years or so, this highly respected and virtuous doctor has been fighting to defend world peace. In 1949, he initiated and convened the American Continent Support World Peace Conference. In 1950, he was elected as a member of the World Peace Council, and in 1951, he was elected as the honorary chairman of the "American Peace Crusade," the central organization of the American peace movement. He strived to combine the struggle of black people in the United States for liberation with the struggle of the American working people. He once clearly declared that the struggle of black people for freedom and rights and the struggle of the American people to defend world peace can only be guaranteed a final victory if they are closely combined with the proletariat and under the leadership of the Communist Party.
    Dr. Du Bois's unwavering struggle for peace has aroused the intense hatred of the U.S. ruling clique. In 1951, after the Peace Propaganda Station, another peace organization he led, collected 2.5 million individual signatures for the Stockholm Peace Appeal, the U.S. government arrested him on charges of "foreign spy." This unreasonable act by the U.S. government aroused angry protests from the broad masses of the American people and aroused angry protests from the Soviet Union, China, and the people of other countries in the world. Under the righteous protests, the U.S. government finally had to declare Dr. Du Bois innocent and release him. In 1952, Dr. Du Bois was awarded the International Peace Prize.
    Dr. Du Bois is also a famous American historian and writer. His works enjoy a very high reputation internationally and have won many doctoral degrees in literature, history, etc. The Soviet Encyclopedia calls him the "founder of American black literature."
    ...The conversation continued. When we asked about his plans for this visit to China, he said:
      "We plan to visit several major cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, etc., visit people's communes, and get to know the Chinese people and their leaders."
      "We are both writers and plan to write something about China. We participated in the October Revolution Festival in the Soviet Union, and this time we plan to spend May Day in China," Mrs. Shirley Graham added.
    Dr. Du Bois also happily told us: "February 23rd is my ninety-first birthday, and I will spend it in the capital of the Chinese people!"
    On the day of his ninety-first birthday, we wish Dr. Du Bois longevity and wish him to emit greater light and heat in his old age for the cause of black liberation, for the progressive cause of the American people, and for the cause of defending peace! (Attached picture)
    On February 17, Dr. Du Bois and his wife sang the American folk song "We'll Never Be Fond of War Again" at the welcome banquet held by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace. In the middle is Ding Xilin, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.

    光辉的事业　和平的战士
    ——杜波伊斯夫妇访问记
    本报记者　于民生
      “虽然我一直没有机会接触并了解伟大的中国人民，但是从童年时代起，我就感觉和他们很接近。他们和我是真正的兄弟。今天，我看到他们在世界上升到他们应得的地位，我满心欣喜。”美国著名黑人学者、世界和平理事会理事杜波伊斯博士在去年7月间给宋庆龄副委员长的信中这样写道。
    半年多以后的今天，杜波伊斯博士和他的夫人歇莉·格雷姆到中国来作客了。当我们在北京饭店访问这两位年老的夫妇时，他们一再表示，他们不能表达出来到中国以后的高兴心情。
    已经九十一岁高龄的杜波伊斯博士，头发虽多已脱落，络腮美髯也已斑白，然而，他老当益壮，神采焕发。当我们问他有什么话要转达给中国人民时，这位黑人学者兴奋地说：“我们夫妇两人向中国人民问候，向他们祝贺，祝他们未来有更大成就。我们带来了美国一千八百万黑人的好意。”
    灿烂的阳光透过玻璃窗射进这座雅静的会客室里，令人感到分外的温暖。我们的谈话越深入，我们就越感到这位美国黑人领袖对中国人民的友情是多么深厚。在1950年，杜波伊斯博士就曾明确指出，美国“必须与苏联和中国在一个世界上相处”，他强烈地反对美国政府支持蒋介石。在1952年在答复南美洲一百二十位领袖关于参加美洲大陆和平大会的信里，他写道：“我们唯一的希望，就是举行这样的大会，来唤起世界上主张和平的人，唤起被束缚的工人来确保和平，改革工业，按照公道而不以欺骗、偷窃、赌博等方法来分配财富，俾使南北美洲的进步人士可以和社会主义的欧洲、共产主义的苏联、解放了的中国站在一起，来形成一个公正的世界。”在1955年，杜波伊斯博士还写信给全美国报纸的编辑，谴责美国在台湾问题上的公开侵略行为。
    这位九十一岁的学者告诉我们，早在1936年他就曾到中国访问过一个短时间。在中国人民革命胜利以后，他一直想访问新中国，然而，美国国务院不给他护照，所以他就不能够来。去年冲破了重重障碍得到了出国护照以后，他即致函宋庆龄副委员长希望访华。现在他的这个愿望终于实现了。
    在我们访问的过程中，歇莉·格雷姆夫人一直谈笑风生，显得那样愉快。她是美国有名的作家，是世界和平理事会的理事，也是美苏友好协会全国委员会的理事。就是这位年已六十岁的夫人，不久前代表杜波伊斯博士参加全非人民大会的时候，曾同美国黑人歌唱家保罗·罗伯逊的夫人一起亲手扯下了国民党所谓的“国旗”，打击了美国政府制造“两个中国”的阴谋。当我们对她这种正义的行为表示感谢的时候，她向我们描绘了当时的情景。那时，会场上升起了国民党的所谓“国旗”，新中国的代表拒绝出席大会。美国政府制造“两个中国”的阴谋，激起了人们的愤怒，歇莉·格雷姆夫人和罗伯逊的夫人把代表着黑暗和屈辱的国民党的所谓“国旗”扯了下来，并且扔出了会场……。
      “在全非人民大会上的时候，访问中国还只是一个梦想，今天这个梦想竟变成了现实！”歇莉·格雷姆夫人尽情地笑起来。
    我们的话题，由友谊转到美国黑人解放运动上来。杜波伊斯博士详细地向我们介绍了美国黑人解放运动的历史。他说：“在历史上，美国黑人的解放运动一直没有停止过。”
    “历史上一直说美国在解放黑人，这是不真实的。其实是黑人在自己解放自己。”杜波伊斯博士强调地说。
    “在美国南部有成百万成百万的黑人被剥夺了选举权，绝大部分黑人不能和白人在一个学校受教育，黑人是被奴役、榨取的对象，失掉了起码的生活权利。”杜波伊斯博士这些话使我们对美国黑人的处境激起了深切的同情。
    杜波伊斯博士充满信心地向我们表示：“美国黑人的斗争一定会胜利，我们一定会得到我们的平等权利。”他又说：“苏联和中国的存在对我们的斗争很有利，这就使我们的反对者不敢像过去那样公开用武力来对付我们了。”
    歇莉·格雷姆夫人曾专门向我们介绍了杜波伊斯博士的生平。杜波伊斯博士从十九世纪以来，一直是为争取民主权利而斗争的美国黑人群众的领袖。他对美国的科学、文学方面的贡献，为保障和争取有色人种的民主权利和保卫世界和平作出的努力，一直为世界公正舆论所称颂和尊敬。
    远在中学毕业以后，杜波伊斯博士就在美国南部看到了美国黑人遭受压迫，过着悲惨而贫困的生活……，这一切使年青的杜波伊斯立志要为黑人的解放而奋斗。1892年在德国留学以后，杜波伊斯到中欧去旅行了一年，他看到很多人的生活都很苦，这使他认识到，受压迫的人，不仅仅是美国黑人，在世界上到处都有。从此，他的思想领域更加广阔了。六七十年来，他始终致力于美国黑人的解放斗争。为了了解黑人的生活，他曾经带着妻子和儿女住在黑人贫民窟中和黑人同生活。他写了许许多多关于黑人问题的书籍，鼓舞黑人为自己的解放而斗争。他号召美国全体黑人控诉他们不幸的遭遇，坚决要求获得完全的选举权，废除种族歧视制度，要求社交自由和在法律面前与白人一律平等。杜波伊斯博士是美国有色人种促进协会的创始人之一。
    在第一次世界大战期间，杜波伊斯博士曾经到欧洲去了解黑人士兵的情况，这使他发现美国黑人问题和非洲问题实际上是一个问题。于是他到巴黎发起和召开了第一次泛非会议。从1918年以来，泛非会议已举行了五次，去年在加纳阿克拉举行的全非人民大会实际上就是泛非会议的第六次会议。杜波伊斯博士对我们说：“美国黑人对非洲的事情很关心，因为非洲是他们的祖国。”这话正说明了博士对非洲人的深厚感情。
    令人敬佩的是，杜波伊斯博士虽然多次遭到美国政府的无理迫害，但是他坚持不屈地积极参加了争取民主自由和世界和平的斗争。最近十年多以来，这位年高德劭的博士，一直为保卫世界和平而战斗着。1949年他发起召开了美洲大陆拥护世界和平大会。1950年被选为世界和平理事会理事，1951年当选为美国和平运动的中心组织“美国和平十字军”的名誉主席。他努力使美国黑人争取解放的斗争同美国劳动人民的斗争结合起来。他曾经明确地宣布：黑人争取自由权利的斗争、美国人民保卫世界和平的斗争，只有同无产阶级紧密结合并在共产党的领导之下，才能保证最后胜利。
    杜波伊斯博士为和平事业的坚毅斗争，引起了美国统治集团的切齿仇视。1951年在他所领导的另一个和平组织——和平宣传站，为斯德哥尔摩和平宣言征集了二百五十万个人的签名之后，美国政府以“外国间谍”的罪名将他逮捕。美国政府这种无理的行为，引起了美国广大人民的愤怒抗议，引起了苏联、中国和世界其他各国人民的愤怒抗议。在正义的抗议下，美国政府终于不得不宣告杜波伊斯博士无罪而把他释放出来。在1952年杜波伊斯博士获得了国际和平奖金。
    杜波伊斯博士也是美国著名的历史学家和作家。他的著作在国际上享有极高的声誉，曾多次获得文学、历史学等博士称号，苏联大百科全书称他为“美国黑人文学的奠基者”。
    ……谈话继续着。当我们问到这次访问中国的计划时，他说：
      “我们准备访问几个主要城市，如北京、上海、杭州、广州等，参观人民公社，认识认识中国人民和他们的领袖。”
      “我们两个都是作家，准备写一些关于中国的东西，我们在苏联参加了十月革命节，这次准备在中国度过五一节。”歇莉·格雷姆夫人补充说。
    杜波伊斯博士又愉快地告诉我们：“2月23日，是我的九十一岁生日，我将在中国人民的首都度过它！”
    在九十一岁诞辰的日子里，我们祝杜波伊斯博士长寿，祝他在晚年为黑人的解放事业、为美国人民的进步事业和保卫和平的事业的斗争发出更大的光和热！（附图片）
    2月17日，杜波伊斯博士和他的夫人在中国人民对外文化协会和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的欢迎宴会上合唱“我们再不留恋战争”美国民歌。中间是中国人民对外文化协会副会长丁西林。
