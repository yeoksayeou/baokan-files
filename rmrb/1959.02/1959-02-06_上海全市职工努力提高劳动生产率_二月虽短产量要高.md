    Industrial Base Brimming with Spring Vigor
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 5th. A new production upsurge, centered on improving labor productivity, is taking shape on Shanghai's industrial front. The current goal proposed by the vast number of workers is to break with convention and produce more and better products in February, the month with the fewest production days and the most holidays.
    These past three or four days, most factories throughout the city have been engaging in extensive airing of views and debates focused on completing the 1959 Great Leap Forward plan and improving labor productivity. Many factories are seizing the few days before the Spring Festival to propose measures and make various preparations targeting the current key to production, so that workers can immediately engage in vigorous work after the Spring Festival holiday. The Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory, which bears significant responsibilities in the national electrical machinery manufacturing industry, has already posted nearly ten thousand big-character posters and is conducting mass inspections and production preparations targeting major new products under trial production, steam turbine generators in production, and other supporting complete sets of products, to ensure that February's task is completed with even more volume than January. The Shanghai Boiler Factory's February task is 28% higher than January, and it must also manufacture large boilers with evaporation capacities of 140 tons and 280 tons, which have never been produced before. Currently, workers are actively organizing special research, engaging in specialized machine tools and large-scale indigenous equipment to ensure the completion of the task. The 280-ton boiler, which will be put into production after the Spring Festival, has already completed process preparations to ensure that this new product is manufactured in February. Workers at the Huasheng Electric Fan Factory plan to implement 142 technical innovation projects before the Spring Festival. On February 1st alone, 17 projects were implemented, one of which increased production efficiency tenfold. Many factories in the steel, machinery, light textile, and industrial systems have also made arrangements for February production. Many factory workers have already launched competitions to achieve the Great Leap Forward plan.
    In order to ensure the completion of the greater leap forward tasks in February and this year, electrical workers are preparing to use the interval of factory shutdowns during the Spring Festival to overhaul power generation equipment and transmission lines. The four power plants of Yangshupu, Zhabei, Nanshi, and Wangting, as well as the power supply department, have organized a repair team of nearly a thousand people, ready to act immediately when the Spring Festival arrives. Many factories are also preparing to organize manpower during the Spring Festival to overhaul boilers, cranes, motors, and frequently used important equipment. Factories such as the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory and the Shanghai Jingye Machine Factory also plan to adjust production lines during the holidays to make the arrangement of machine tools and other equipment more reasonable, so as to organize production more effectively after the Spring Festival.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 4th. Shanghai's 1.2 million industrial workers have launched the first salvo of the greater leap forward in 1959. In January, the city's total industrial output value increased by 56.3% compared to the same period last year, with heavy industry increasing by 89.1%. Products such as cotton textiles, knitwear, large-scale metal cutting machine tools, steam turbine generators, boilers, mining equipment, as well as cement and nitric acid, have all completed or overfulfilled their January production plans.

    工业基地春意浓
    上海全市职工努力提高劳动生产率
    二月虽短产量要高
    新华社上海5日电　上海工业战线上正在形成一个以提高劳动生产率为中心的生产新高潮。广大职工提出的当前的奋斗目标是：打破常规，在生产日最少、休假日最多的2月份中，生产出更多更好的产品。
    这三、四天，全市大部分工厂都在围绕着完成1959年跃进计划和提高劳动生产率进行大鸣大放。许多工厂正在抓紧春节前的几天，针对当前生产关键，提出措施，做好各种准备，以便职工们在春节假期以后，立即大干特干。在全国电机制造业中担负着重大任务的上海电机厂，职工们已经贴出近万张大字报，并且针对正在试制中的重大新产品、正在生产中的汽轮发电机和其他协作成套的产品，进行群众性的检查和春节后的生产准备，保证2月份完成比1月份还要多的任务。上海锅炉厂2月份的任务比1月份高28％，还要制造从未生产过的蒸发量一百四十吨和二百八十吨的大型锅炉。现在，职工们正纷纷组织专题研究，大搞专用机床和大型土设备，保证完成任务。春节后就要投入生产的二百八十吨锅炉，现在已经作好了工艺准备，保证2月份把这项新产品制成。华生电机厂职工打算在春节前实现一百四十二项技术革新项目，2月1日一天就实现了十七个项目，其中一项就将生产效率提高了十倍。钢铁、机械、轻纺工业系统的许多工厂，也对2月份的生产作好了安排。很多工厂职工已经为实现跃进计划展开了竞赛。
    为了保证2月份和今年更大跃进任务的完成，电业工人们准备利用春节各厂停工的间隙，检修发电设备和输电线路。杨树浦、闸北、南市、望亭等四个发电厂以及供电部门，已经组织了近千人的检修队伍，准备春节一到立即行动。许多工厂也准备在春节期内组织人力，检修锅炉、行车、电动机和使用频繁的重要设备。上海电机厂和上海精业机器厂等工厂，还打算在假期内调整生产作业线，使机床等设备排列得更加合理，以便春节后更有效地组织生产。
    据新华社上海4日电　上海一百二十万产业工人打响了1959年更大跃进的第一炮。1月份全市工业总产值比去年同期增长56.3％，其中重工业增长89.1％。棉纺、针织、大型金属切削机床、汽轮发电机、锅炉、矿山设备，以及水泥、硝酸等产品，都完成和超额完成了1月份生产计划。
