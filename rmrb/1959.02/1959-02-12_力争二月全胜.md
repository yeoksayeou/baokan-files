　　Strive for a Complete Victory in February

　　The Spring Festival holiday is over. Everyone had a great time during the holiday and rested comfortably. Today, they have returned to their production posts full of energy. We hope that everyone will concentrate their energy after the rest on striving for the battle goal of a complete victory in February.

　　February is the month with the fewest days in a year, and even fewer working days. This month is a crucial month for completing the first quarter plan. People often say, "A year's plan starts in spring." Whether this "year's plan" is grasped well or not depends, to a considerable extent, on the results of February. Therefore, ensuring the comprehensive completion of the production and construction plan for February is of particular and important significance.

　　Comrades in Beijing have done a great job. Before the Spring Festival, that is, in the first seven days of February, they completed the plan for the first ten days of the month. This approach of starting early rather than late can most reliably guarantee victory. We look forward to the second good news from Beijing: completing the production and construction plan for the middle ten days of the month before the 20th. Of course, we hope that more regions will send such good news. We believe that there will be countless such good news.

    力争二月全胜
    春节假期已经过去。大家在假期中玩得痛痛快快，休息得舒舒服服，今天都精神抖擞地回到生产岗位上来了。我们希望大家把休息之后的浑身干劲，集中使用到力争2月份全胜这个战斗目标上来。
    2月份是一年当中日子最少、工作日更少的一个月。这个月是完成第一季度计划的关键性的一个月。人们常说“一年之计在于春”，这“一年之计”抓得好不好，在相当程度上要看2月份的战绩如何。因此，保证全面完成2月份的生产建设计划，实在有特殊重要的意义。
    北京市的职工同志们干得出色，早在春节前，也就是说，在2月份的头七天，就完成了上旬十天的计划。这种赶早不赶晚的做法，能够最可靠地保证得到胜利。我们期待着北京市的第二个捷报：在20日以前，完成中旬的生产建设计划。当然，我们更希望有更多的地区发来这样的捷报。我们相信，也一定会有无数这样的捷报。
