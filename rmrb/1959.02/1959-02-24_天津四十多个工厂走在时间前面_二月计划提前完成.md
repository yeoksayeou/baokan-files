Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 23rd: As of February 21st, more than forty factories in Tianjin had already completed their February production plans ahead of schedule, and some factories had even completed their first quarter plans ahead of schedule.

During February, the broad masses of workers on the city's industrial front beat the drums of war to welcome spring, launching a high tide of production competition centered on the technical revolution, presenting a scene of intense battle everywhere to complete the February and first quarter production plans ahead of schedule. The Tianjin Bicycle Factory completed its first quarter production plan ahead of schedule on the 19th. The No. 1 Vehicle Repair and Assembly Factory and other factories also completed their first quarter production plans ahead of schedule. The Comprehensive Woodworking Factory of the Handicraft Industry Bureau had a production task for February that was 10% higher than in January, but the workers worked hard and became more and more energetic, completing the entire month's plan on the 17th. The Hongqi Chemical Factory in Hedong District reported good news every day in February, producing many new products, and completing the entire month's plan ahead of schedule on the 20th.

The workers of many factories, focusing on key production issues, actively improved product designs, saved raw materials, and realized the mechanization of operating procedures in the technical revolution movement, which powerfully promoted production. An old worker in the forging workshop of the Mingquan Weighing Factory designed and manufactured a light-duty electric hammer himself, replacing manual forging, increasing work efficiency three times, and producing high-quality parts. The Belt Conveyor Factory solved the raw material problem and increased labor productivity through technical revolution, and also completed its February production plan eight days ahead of schedule.

Throughout the city, factories carried out competitions between industries, between enterprises, between workshops, between groups, and between individuals. Factories learned from the advanced, and everyone strived to move upstream. The red flag competition in the Weijin Cultural and Educational Supplies Factory was in full swing. Advanced producers Sun Diying and Liu Shuzhen chased each other, and each person's daily output of mimeograph spring strips increased sharply from sixty to more than two hundred and forty. The workshops and groups of the Friendship Clothing Factory respectively established "flowering and fruiting trees." Suggestions for innovation were made, and a flower was inserted. After realization, a fruit was hung, which further improved the enthusiasm and dedication of the workers.

    天津四十多个工厂走在时间前面
    二月计划提前完成
    据新华社天津23日电　到21日为止，天津市已有四十多个工厂提前完成了2月份生产计划，一部分工厂更提前完成了第一季度计划。
    在2月份内，全市工业战线上的广大职工，擂起迎春战鼓，掀起以技术革命为中心的生产竞赛高潮，到处呈现一片为提前完成2月份和一季度的生产计划而紧张战斗的景象。天津自行车厂已提前在19日完成第一季度的生产计划。第一车辆修配厂等工厂，也提前完成了第一季度生产计划。手工业局综合木器厂2月份的生产任务比1月份高10％，但是职工们奋勇图强，越干越起劲，在17日就完成了全月计划。河东区红旗化工厂在2月份内天天传捷报，生产了很多新产品，全月计划到20日就提前完成。
  许多工厂的职工针对生产上的关键问题，在技术革命运动中积极改进产品设计，节约原材料，实现操作过程机械化，有力地推动了生产。明权磅厂锻铁车间老工人自己设计制造一台轻便电锤，代替手工锻打，提高工作效率三倍，打出的部件质量很好。皮带运输机厂通过技术革命，解决了原材料问题，提高了劳动生产率，也提前八天完成了2月份的生产计划。
    全市各工厂在这个月开展了行业之间、企业之间、车间与车间、小组与小组、个人与个人的竞赛，厂厂学先进，人人争上游。卫津文教用品厂的夺红旗竞赛搞得热火朝天，先进生产者孙涤英和刘树珍互相追赶，每人日产油印机簧条由六十个猛增到二百四十多个。友谊服装厂的车间和小组分别设立了“开花结果树”，提了革新建议，就插上一朵花，实现后就挂上一个果，进一步提高了职工的干劲和钻劲。
