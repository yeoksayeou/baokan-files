Chen Jingyu, Chairman of the Hubei Province and Wuhan City Federation of Industry and Commerce and Vice President of the Wuhan Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said, "The realization of the Soviet Union's magnificent seven-year construction plan will far surpass the United States in many aspects, which will play a significant role in preventing war."

In the discussions, people unanimously believed that the Soviet seven-year plan is a very grand plan for transitioning to communism and a milestone in the comprehensive construction of communism. Wang Shengbao, a famous industrial labor model in Guangzhou and Deputy Director of the Xicun Power Plant, said: From Comrade Khrushchev's report, we can be sure that in the near future, the Soviet Union's various production and construction projects will be like launching artificial satellites, leaving the United States far behind. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of our country are in a great era where one day equals twenty years, and the Soviet Union's magnificent plan has given us great encouragement and strength.

Leaders of various people's organizations and local organizations of democratic parties have also issued statements in recent days, praising the Soviet Union's grand program of striding towards communism.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 5th: The successful opening of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the magnificent Soviet national economic seven-year plan have inspired the broad masses of people in Chongqing. In recent days, workers and students from units such as the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory and Chongqing University have held meetings and discussions to enthusiastically discuss Khrushchev's report. Wang Zhizhong, a technician at the Construction Machine Tool Factory, said excitedly: The development of Soviet production and the announced seven-year plan clearly prove that communist society is not something far off in the future, which is a great encouragement to the working people all over the world. Jin Xiru, Vice President of Chongqing University, said in an article celebrating the opening of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: The implementation of the Soviet Communist Party's magnificent seven-year plan for the development of the national economy will lead to the emergence of more new science and technology, and will fight against nature on a larger and broader scale, thereby seeking happiness for mankind. We should better combine this with the actual situation in China and earnestly learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience.

Huang Rongchang and Hou Gangsheng, advanced producers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, were excited after seeing the news of the opening of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the seven-year plan for the national economy. They said: The opening of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a major event of world significance. It demonstrates the unparalleled power of the Soviet Union, and at the same time demonstrates the magnificent prospect of a communist society, the highest ideal of mankind.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 5th: People from all walks of life in Xi'an are enthusiastically celebrating the opening of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

In recent days, many factories and enterprises have held symposiums to celebrate the opening of the congress. Participants unanimously believed that the Soviet seven-year plan is a milestone in the construction of communism, showing a more beautiful prospect of communism and greatly encouraging people's confidence in the victory of the communist cause. The workers of the Water Bubble Group of the Fifth Workshop of the State-owned Northwest Optical Instrument Factory unanimously agreed after discussing Comrade Khrushchev's report that the upcoming seven-year plan once again demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. They said that the rapid development of our country's socialist construction is inseparable from the help of the Soviet Union. In order to celebrate the opening of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, we must work hard to increase production, humbly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and ensure the early completion of the leap forward plan for the first quarter and the whole year.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 5th: Various agencies, schools, factories, communes, and troops stationed in Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City are enthusiastically hailing the opening of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

In recent days, discussions have been held everywhere. Professor Dai Wensai of the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy of Nanjing University said: The Soviet Union's level of production development is so high, and there will be even greater leaps forward in seven years. This makes us more concretely understand the truth that the East wind prevails over the West wind and that the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better and better day by day. Many workers and commune members confidently stated that the Soviet Union is a model for us to learn from. The Soviet people have the confidence to overfulfill the seven-year plan, and we are also determined to overfulfill our leap forward targets in the second year of this three-year hard battle.
