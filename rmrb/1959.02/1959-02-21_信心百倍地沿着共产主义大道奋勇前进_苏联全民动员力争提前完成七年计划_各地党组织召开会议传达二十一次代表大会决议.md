　　Moscow, February 20th (by this newspaper)　Party organizations across the Soviet Union are continuing to hold meetings of activists to convey the various resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU and mobilize the masses to struggle for the realization of the Seven-Year Plan. At the party organization meetings of various Union Republics, states, regions, and cities, CPSU members have listened to reports from delegates to the 21st Congress. In discussing the conference documents, they unanimously pointed out that the resolutions of this Congress and the Seven-Year Plan are a concrete manifestation of Lenin's general line of construction at the present stage, and that the Seven-Year Plan is an important step in the Soviet Union's communist construction. The Party meetings in various regions also pointed out the unprecedented unity of the CPSU party organizations and the Party organizations' enormous task of mobilizing the broad masses to complete the Seven-Year Plan.
　　At the enlarged plenary session of the Georgian Party Central Committee, Mzhavanadze, alternate member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, gave a report on the summary of the 21st Congress of the CPSU and the tasks of the Georgian Party organization. He said that the 21st Congress of the CPSU, which will be recorded in history as the Congress of Communist Builders, once again demonstrated the great vitality of Marxism-Leninism to the world. The congress proved that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, faithful to Marxism-Leninism and maintaining close ties with the people, is confidently leading the Soviet people to advance bravely along the victorious road of communism. Mzhavanadze also said that Lenin's national policy is vividly reflected in the Seven-Year Plan. From 1959 to 1965, the economic culture of the various Union Republics will achieve unprecedented development. At the plenary session, Ghitberidze, Secretary of the Rustavi City Party Committee, said that during the Seven-Year Plan, Georgia will not only continue to develop the steel industry, but also establish a chemical industry for the production of synthetic fibers. Although some difficulties may be encountered in this regard, the Georgian people, under the leadership of the Party, will certainly overcome these difficulties and make Georgia's economy more prosperous.
　　The Moldavian Party organization recently convened a conference of activists. Serdyuk, First Secretary of the Moldavian Communist Party Central Committee, delivered a report. Participants at the meeting unanimously expressed their determination to vigorously mobilize the masses to strive to complete the Republic's industrial production Seven-Year Plan one or two years ahead of schedule. In agriculture, advanced producers in the Soroca District put forward the initiative to reach the 1965 production target in 1961 and challenged other districts.
　　The Leningrad State Party Committee also convened a conference of Party activists, where State Party First Secretary Spiridonov gave a report. He called on all Communist Party members in the Leningrad region to extensively carry out propaganda work among the masses in factories, farms and offices, and to lead the masses in responding to the Party's call with practical actions. Semenov, a worker at the Leningrad Engine Factory, said that workers at their factory launched a heated competition after the 21st Congress of the CPSU. Now hundreds of workers in the factory are completing more than 200% of their production quotas every day, and another forty work teams are fighting for the glorious title of Communist Labor Team. Mozalevsky, director of the power plant, said that their factory will double the production of turbine generators during the Seven-Year Plan. Party members and workers at the factory are further tapping into production potential and striving to complete this task ahead of schedule. Representatives of the Party organizations of many cultural and scientific institutions in Leningrad also spoke at the conference.
　　At the conference of Party activists in the Sverdlovsk region, people heard the bold words of the working people of the Urals to strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The participants unanimously pointed out that the enthusiasm of the working people has been unprecedentedly high since the Party Congress. The task of Party organizations at all levels is to better organize labor competitions, further increase labor productivity, bravely adopt new technologies, and enable the heavy industry of the Urals to achieve further development in the Seven-Year Plan.
　　In addition, Party activist meetings were held in Minsk, Almaty, Gorky and other states. (Attached picture)
