    Build Simple Coking Ovens and Coal Washing Plants on a Large Scale and at High Speed
    The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Ministry of Coal Industry Decide on the Layout for Oven and Plant Construction; Various Localities Rush to Manufacture Coking and Coal Washing Equipment
    Xinhua News Agency, 4th - The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently decided that, from now on, it will concentrate manpower and material resources to build a large number of simple coking ovens across the country to produce enough high-quality coke to ensure the completion of this year's target of 18 million tons of steel and the corresponding pig iron production. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry believes that producing more and better coke is the most urgent task on the metallurgical industry front. Metallurgical industry departments in various localities must go all out, race against time, and ensure that the simple coking ovens are completed and put into production on schedule.
    In order to carry out a crash program to build a large number of "No. 2" simple coking ovens, metallurgical and mechanical industries departments across the country have already mobilized to rush to manufacture complete sets of equipment for the coking ovens. The First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have also jointly issued an urgent directive, deciding that mechanical and metallurgical factories in sixteen provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, including Hebei, Shandong, Sichuan, Shanxi, and Heilongjiang, will rush to manufacture this batch of coking oven equipment. Currently, some of these factories have already started production; a few factories have already manufactured the first batch of equipment. As of January 28, Hengyang Metallurgical Machinery Manufacturing Plant had manufactured more than 200 water pumps, more than 200 blowers, and more than 100 electric motors needed for the coking ovens, and after testing, their operation was in good condition. Many factories, such as Wuhan Iron and Steel Electrical Repair Plant, have prioritized the equipment for these simple coking ovens in their production plans for January and February, taking measures to speed up their manufacture.
    Provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have already started preparations for the construction and production of this batch of simple coking ovens. Based on the principles of being close to blast furnace clusters, close to coal mines, convenient transportation, and access to water and electricity, various localities have arranged the layout of the coking ovens and have begun to prepare building materials such as refractory materials, red bricks, and ceramic tubes, as well as training personnel for oven construction and coking. Hebei Province, which started earlier, decided to first build more than a dozen experimental simple coking ovens after the Spring Festival to gain experience, and then promote them comprehensively. Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Sichuan, Anhui, Heilongjiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces have also decided to establish experimental coking ovens, and then gradually carry out oven construction work; some provinces have convened special meetings, and some provinces have established special agencies to lead this work.
    Xinhua News Agency, 4th - Building simple coal washing plants on a large scale and rapidly increasing coal washing output is an important measure for the coal industry to ensure that the iron and steel and other industrial sectors achieve their leap forward targets for this year. The amount of washed coal needed for iron smelting this year is much higher than last year. In addition to the washed coal needed for steelmaking, copper smelting, casting, and chemical industries, the output of the nation's existing modern coal washing plants and simple coal washing plants is no longer sufficient to meet the demand. Therefore, the Ministry of Coal Industry has decided that, while actively tapping the production potential of existing coal washing plants and accelerating the construction of new modern coal preparation plants, it is necessary to rapidly and massively build simple coal washing plants this year. Although the quality of the washed coal produced by simple coal washing plants is not as good as that of modern coal washing plants, it meets the requirements of small and medium-sized iron and steel plants, and the construction time is short, which can meet the current needs.
    Based on the resource situation of raw coal to be washed and conditions such as transportation, power supply, and water source, these simple coal washing plants will be distributed in fifty-three coal mining areas in twenty-two provinces and autonomous regions, with a focus on the North China, East China, and Central China regions. These regions produce more coking coal, have a greater demand for coking coal, and their original coal washing capacity is relatively weak. These simple coal washing plants will use four types of plant designs, with a greater emphasis on small plants, which can achieve the effect of low investment and fast construction. The Ministry of Coal Industry requires that the vast majority of these simple coal washing plants start construction in the first quarter.
    Complete sets of equipment for this batch of simple coal washing plants have been decided to be manufactured separately by factories under the mechanical industry and coal industry departments. The First Ministry of Machine Building has arranged for mining machinery plants in Shenyang, Luoyang, Hefei, and Shanghai to rush to manufacture equipment for coal washing plants and to start delivering them successively from March.
    Currently, the Ministry of Coal Industry has listed the construction of simple coal washing plants as a primary task and has established a special office to strengthen leadership over this work. The Ministry of Coal Industry requires local coal mine management agencies and enterprise units, under the unified leadership of the local Party committees, to designate full-time directors (bureaus) and factory and mine managers, and to establish special agencies to strengthen leadership over the construction of simple coal washing plants and to regularly supervise and inspect the work.

### 集中力量，分秒必争，确保完成1800万吨钢的伟大任务  大建快建简易炼焦炉和洗煤厂  冶金部煤炭部决定建炉建厂布局，各地赶制炼焦洗煤设备

    集中力量，分秒必争，确保完成1800万吨钢的伟大任务
    大建快建简易炼焦炉和洗煤厂
    冶金部煤炭部决定建炉建厂布局，各地赶制炼焦洗煤设备
    新华社4日讯　冶金工业部最近决定，从现在起集中人力物力，在全国建设大批简易炼焦炉，生产足够的质量良好的焦炭，以确保完成今年一千八百万吨钢和与此相适应的生铁生产任务。冶金工业部认为，生产又多又好的焦炭，是冶金工业战线上当前最急迫的任务，各地冶金工业部门必须全力以赴，分秒必争，使简易炼焦炉按期建成和投入生产。
    为了突击建设大批“二号”简易炼焦炉，目前全国各地冶金、机械工业部门已经动员起来，赶制焦炉的成套设备。第一机械工业部和冶金工业部还联合发出紧急指示，决定由河北、山东、四川、山西、黑龙江等十六个省、市、自治区的机械工厂和冶金工厂，赶制这一批炼焦炉设备。现在，这些工厂有的已经投料，开始生产；少数工厂已经制造出了第一批设备。衡阳冶金机械制造厂到1月28日为止，已经制成了焦炉所需的二百多台水泵、二百多台鼓风机和一百多台电动机，经过试验以后，运转情况良好。武钢电修厂等不少工厂，在安排1、2月份生产计划时，都把这批简易炼焦炉的设备排在第一位，采取措施，加紧赶制。
    各省、市、自治区已经着手进行这批简易炼焦炉的建设准备和生产准备工作。各地根据靠近高炉群、靠近煤矿和交通方便、有水有电等原则，安排了炼焦炉的布局，并开始准备耐火材料、红砖陶瓷管等建筑材料和培训建炉、炼焦人员。动手较早的河北省，决定在春节以后，先建成十几座试验性的简易炼焦炉，从中吸取经验，然后全面推广。山东、山西、河南、四川、安徽、黑龙江、湖南、江西等省，也都决定建立试验炼焦炉，然后分批展开建炉工作；有的省召开了专门会议，有的省成立了专门机构，领导进行这一工作。
    新华社4日讯　大建简易洗煤厂，迅速增加洗煤产量，这是煤炭工业保证钢铁等工业部门实现今年跃进指标的重要措施。今年炼铁需要的洗煤比去年增加很多，加上炼钢、炼铜、铸造、化工等部门所需的洗煤，全国现有的现代化洗煤厂和简易洗煤厂的产量，已经不能满足需要。因此，煤炭工业部决定，在积极挖掘现有洗煤厂的生产潜力和加速建设新的现代化选煤厂的同时，今年要迅速地大量地建设简易洗煤厂。简易洗煤厂所产的洗煤，质量虽不及现代化洗煤厂的好，但是合乎中小型钢铁厂的要求，而且建设时间短，能够满足当前需要。
    根据入洗原煤的资源情况和交通、电源、水源等条件，这些简易洗煤厂将分布在二十二个省、自治区的五十三个煤矿区内，其中又着重分布在华北、华东和华中地区，这些地区生产焦煤较多、对焦煤的需要量较大，而原来的洗煤能力也比较薄弱。这些简易洗煤厂是用四种厂型，其中较多的是小型厂，可以收投资少、建设快的效果。煤炭工业部要求这些简易洗煤厂中的绝大部分在第一季度内动工兴建。
    这一批简易洗煤厂的成套设备，已决定由机械工业和煤炭工业部门所属的工厂分别制造。第一机械工业部已经安排了沈阳、洛阳、合肥和上海等地的矿山机械厂为洗煤厂赶制设备，并且从3月份起开始陆续交货。
    目前，煤炭工业部已经把简易洗煤厂的建设工作列为首要任务，并且建立了专门办公室，加强对这一工作的领导。煤炭工业部要求各地煤矿管理机构和企业单位，在当地党委的统一领导下，指定专职的厅（局）长、厂矿长，并建立专门机构，加强领导简易洗煤厂的建设工作，经常督促检查。（附图片）
