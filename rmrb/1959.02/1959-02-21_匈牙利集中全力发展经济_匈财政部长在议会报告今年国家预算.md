Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 20th. The Hungarian National Assembly continued its session on the morning of the 19th, with Minister of Finance Antos István delivering a report on the 1959 national budget.

The reporter pointed out that Hungary has completely healed the wounds brought about by the counter-revolutionary events, and the recovery phase has basically ended. Now, the process of expanded reproduction is proceeding normally in the country, and we have all the conditions to concentrate all our efforts on developing the national economy and accelerating the construction of socialism.

Hungary's total budget revenue for this year will reach 52,896 million forints (Hungarian currency), and total expenditure will reach 52,059 million forints. Revenue exceeds expenditure by 837 million forints.

Compared with 1958, this year's budget revenue increased by 11.9%, and expenditure increased by 11.8%.

Speaking about the use of this year's budget, Antos pointed out that in the budget expenditure, 55.5% is used to develop the national economy, and 31.3% is used for social welfare and cultural aspects. 9.4% is used to maintain the armed forces and other public security work. Administrative expenses account for only 3.8%.

This year's budget investment increased by 1.9 billion forints compared to last year, of which 76% will be used for production investment and 24% for the construction of housing and schools.

In this year's heavy industry investment, the investment in power production and coal mines is relatively large. The investment in the machinery industry is mainly used to develop the production of diesel locomotives, high-voltage industrial telecommunications equipment and instruments; the investment in light industry is concentrated on expanding paper mills, leather and shoe factories, and canned milk manufacturing industries. At the same time, the transportation network will be developed, and 150 new stores will be built.

The funds used in this year's budget to develop agricultural production cooperatives have increased significantly compared to last year, with a total investment of 1.025 billion forints, equivalent to twice that of last year.

This year, we will continue to improve the people's living standards, the actual wages of workers and staff will increase by 3%, and this year's preferential treatment for disabled veterans has increased by 25%, improving the lives of 430,000 elderly people. 350 million forints will also be used to ensure the adjustment of wages for health workers and primary and secondary school teachers, the state will build 13,000 housing units, and 865 million forints will be allocated as housing construction loans.

Expenditure on health, social welfare, and culture will also increase by 17.5%, and investment in the development of scientific research will increase by 18% compared to last year.

Antos said that we have noticed the over fulfillment of last year's plan, so we are considering whether we can accelerate a little faster than originally planned. The Hungarian people are paying great attention to the magnificent goals of the Soviet Communist Party's 21st Congress's Seven-Year Plan, and are also very concerned about the socialist construction achievements of the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries. The issue of accelerating socialist construction has already been raised among the broad masses of the Hungarian people. The Hungarian people have the creative enthusiasm and will to achieve greater goals.

Antos pointed out that we must increase export production, and at the same time, accelerate the realization of investment goals, and use funds rationally and centrally. We must maximize the use of existing equipment, further tap production potential, continue to develop technology, vigorously reduce costs, increase productivity and practice economy.

After Antos's report, the representatives began to discuss the 1959 national budget.

    匈牙利集中全力发展经济
    匈财政部长在议会报告今年国家预算
    新华社布达佩斯20日电　19日上午匈牙利国民议会继续开会，财政部长安托什·伊斯特万作了关于1959年国家预算的报告。
    报告人指出，匈牙利已经完全医治好反革命事件所带来的创伤，恢复阶段基本结束。现在国内正常地进行着扩大再生产的过程，我们已具备一切条件集中所有的力量来发展国民经济，加速社会主义的建设。
    匈牙利今年的预算总收入将达五百二十八亿九千六百万福林（匈币），总支出将达五百二十亿五千九百万福林。收入超过支出八亿三千七百万福林。
    与1958年相比，今年的预算收入增加了11.9％，支出增加了11.8％。
    谈到今年预算的用途时，安托什指出，在预算支出中，55.5％用来发展国民经济，31.3％用于社会福利和文化方面。9.4％用在维持武装部队以及其它治安工作方面。用在行政开支方面的只占3.8％。
    今年预算投资比去年增加十九亿福林，其中76％将用在生产投资上，24％用在住宅和学校等的建设上。
    今年重工业投资中，电力生产和煤矿方面的投资较大。机器工业的投资主要是用在发展柴油机车、高电压工业电讯器材和仪器的生产方面；轻工业投资集中使用在扩建造纸、皮革与皮鞋工厂，以及罐头牛奶制造工业方面。同时要发展交通网，并新建一百五十个商店。
    今年的预算中用于发展农业生产合作社的资金比去年有了显著的增长，共投资十亿二千五百万福林，相当于去年的两倍。
    今年要继续提高人民生活水平，职工的实际工资将提高3％，今年优抚金提高了25％，改善了四十三万老年人的生活。还要用三亿五千万福林保证调整卫生工作者和中小学教员的工资，国家将建筑一万三千套住宅，并拨八亿六千五百万福林作为住宅建设的贷款。
    卫生、社会福利和文化方面的开支也将提高17.5％、发展科学研究方面的投资比去年提高18％。
    安托什说，我们注意到去年计划的超额完成，因而在考虑是否可以比原计划加快一点。匈牙利人民以极大的注意力关心着苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会通过的七年计划的宏伟目标，同时也很关心中华人民共和国和其它社会主义国家的社会主义建设成就。在匈牙利广大群众中已经提出了加快社会主义建设的问题。匈牙利人民具有实现更大目标的创造热情和意志。
    安托什指出，我们要提高出口生产，同时要加快实现投资目标，合理和集中地使用资金。要最大限度地使用现有的设备、进一步挖掘生产潜力、继续发展技术、大力降低成本、提高生产率和厉行节约。
    在安托什的报告后，代表们开始了对1959年国家预算的讨论。
