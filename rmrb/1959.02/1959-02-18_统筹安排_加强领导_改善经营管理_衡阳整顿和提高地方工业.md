According to a report in the New Hunan Daily, Hengyang City is vigorously reorganizing and improving its local industries, enabling them to better serve large-scale industry, agricultural production, and the people's livelihood.

During the Great Leap Forward last year, Hengyang City launched a mass movement of the whole party and all the people to run local industries on a large scale, resulting in a leap forward in the city's industrial production. Last year, the total output value of local industries reached 149.05 million yuan, equivalent to 2.74 times that of 1957, and 403 new and expanded factories were built. These factories have played a significant role in supporting national construction and meeting social needs. However, as these factories were newly established, organizational leadership, political and ideological work, and production management had not yet caught up. Some factories had varying degrees of problems in their service direction, business management, income distribution, and welfare that urgently needed to be resolved. The Hengyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China seriously analyzed the above situation, and in accordance with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and relevant instructions from the Hunan Provincial Committee, and based on the principles of promoting a greater leap forward in production, close collaboration, and convenience for the people, it closely focused on and combined with production, and promptly carried out the reorganization, consolidation, and improvement of local industries, especially street industries. The more than 230 enterprises run by districts and streets that were newly established last year were initially reorganized into 172.

Reorganizing local industries, especially street industries, is a new task that requires overall planning, careful deployment, overall arrangements, and strengthened leadership. Before the reorganization began, the district committees and relevant departments conducted investigations into the factory and community situations, such as the thinking of cadres and the masses, the source of personnel, management systems, wages, and welfare. Taking into account the conditions of raw material supply, the possibility of labor arrangement, and the needs of the state and society, they made comprehensive and specific reorganization plans, and reorganized, consolidated, and improved factories with the same nature, similar business, and close cooperative relations in batches, so that those that should be merged were merged, those that should be transferred were transferred, and those that should be expanded were expanded.

In order to strengthen the leadership of this work, under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, each district successively established reorganization offices or leading groups, headed by the district party secretary, who personally took charge of the leadership. The Municipal Party Committee also transferred full-time cadres and established a special agency, led and managed specifically by an industrial secretary and deputy minister.

Regarding the reorganization work, many cadres and workers have a clearer understanding. However, some people have different views and concerns. Some only see that the factory has developed by leaps and bounds from scratch last year, and fail to see some of the new problems brought about by the great development, and feel that all aspects are almost the same, and reorganization is "unnecessary"; Some believe that reorganization is necessary, but have various concerns and dare not boldly express their opinions. In view of the above situation, the municipal party committee led the districts and factories to convene cadre meetings, employee meetings, small-scale symposiums, etc., through summing up the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, affirmed the achievements, raised problems, explained the significance, purpose, and requirements of carrying out the reorganization work, and used the methods of great airing of views, great contending, great debate, and big-character posters to guide the masses, correctly understand the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and clarify the importance and necessity of the reorganization work, so that the reorganization work was quickly and smoothly carried out. For example, the Heping Electrical Appliance Factory, through in-depth ideological mobilization, quickly launched a wave of enthusiasm for doing a good job in production and reorganization. In a few days, workers posted more than 120 big-character posters, many of which were extremely beneficial to improving the level of business management and promoting a greater leap forward in production.

On the basis of ideological mobilization, in accordance with the specific situation of the unit and production needs, each factory grasped the work of enterprise management, in the spirit of starting from the easy to the difficult, from the rough to the fine, and began to establish and improve some necessary production responsibility systems to meet the needs of a greater leap forward in production. For example, the Chengnan Machinery Factory, which was formed by merging three hardware machinery units with the same nature and similar business, vigorously strengthened management work in the process of reorganization, initially improved the raw material receipt, dispatch, storage, financial expenditure, and quality inspection systems, implemented the "five fixings" (fixing people, fixing machine tools, fixing products, fixing output, fixing quality), "three accounting systems" (cash receipts and expenditures accounting, receipts and dispatch storage accounting, public property accounting), and "one approval" (the tools and equipment that need to be added must go through certain approval procedures), and the production plan was passed down to the workshop, team, and even individual, and the three tasks, key points, and measures were explained to the masses, and the combination of leaders, technicians, and workers was implemented. Due to the strengthening of management work and the establishment of the responsibility system, the workers' sense of responsibility for production has been greatly strengthened, and the enthusiasm for the leap forward is even greater. In January, the leap forward plan was overfulfilled by more than double.

Through the reorganization, the service direction of street industries has also been clarified, overcoming the past ideas of some factories that were willing to engage in manufacturing and batch production, and unwilling to engage in repairing and matching and sporadic work. After correcting the service direction, the Chengbei Hardware Machinery Factory, which was formed by merging seven private small hardware factories, clarified that street industries must focus on repairing and matching and supplement with manufacturing, and grasp repairing and matching and manufacturing with both hands, greatly expanding the repairing and matching business. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has repaired and matched more than 3,000 pieces of tools such as water pumps, hoes, rake heads, shovels, and axes, which have strongly supported industrial and agricultural production, and enabled the factory to overfulfill the production plan by 44.4% in January, an increase of 43% compared with December last year.

Many factories in Hengyang City have launched a new and greater leap forward in production by grasping production with one hand and reorganizing, consolidating, and improving work with the other. The broad masses of workers and staff are making great efforts in technical revolution. According to statistics from the three urban districts, the district-run and private factories put forward a total of 3,919 innovation proposals in January, and implemented 1,739, of which 931 will save a total value of more than 1,059,000 yuan throughout the year.

    统筹安排　加强领导　改善经营管理
    衡阳整顿和提高地方工业
    据新湖南报消息　衡阳市大力编整和提高地方工业，使它们能更好地为大工业、农业生产和人民生活服务。
    在去年的大跃进中，衡阳市掀起了全党全民大办地方工业的群众运动，使全市工业生产有了飞跃的发展。去年地方工业总产值达一亿四千九百零五万元，相当于1957年的二点七四倍，并新建和扩建了四百零三个工厂。这些工厂在支援国家建设、适应社会需要等方面起了很大的作用。但是由于这些工厂新建不久，在组织领导、政治思想工作以及生产管理工作等方面，还没有来得及跟上去，有些工厂在服务方向、经营管理、收入分配、生活福利等方面还存在不同程度的问题亟待解决。中共衡阳市委认真地分析了上述情况，根据党的八届六中全会和湖南省委有关指示的精神，本着有利于促进生产更大跃进，密切协作和便民利民的原则，紧密围绕和结合生产，抓紧进行了对地方工业特别是街道工业的编整、巩固和提高工作，把去年新办的区属和街道办的二百三十多个企业单位初步编整为一百七十二个。
    编整地方工业特别是街道工业，是一件新的工作，必须全面规划，周密部署，统筹安排，加强领导。在开始编整前，各区委和有关部门对厂社情况，如干群思想、人员来源、管理制度、工资福利等都进行了调查摸底，并考虑到原材料供应的条件，劳动力安排的可能和国家社会的需要，作出了全面具体的编整规划，将一些性质相同、业务相近、协作关系密切的工厂，分期分批进行编整、巩固和提高，做到该合并的合并，该转厂的转厂，该扩充的扩充。
    为了加强对这一工作的领导，在市委的统一领导下，各区先后成立了编整办公室或领导小组，由区委书记挂帅，亲自掌握领导。市委也抽调了专职干部，设立了专门机构，由一个工业书记和副部长具体领导和掌管这方面的工作。
    对于编整工作，许多干部和职工都有较明确的认识。但也有部分人有一些不同的看法和顾虑。有的只看到厂里去年从无到有，从小到大，生产获得了飞跃发展，看不到在大发展中带来的一些新的问题，觉得各方面都差不多了，搞编整是“多此一举”；有的虽认为编整有必要，但存在各种不同的顾虑，不敢大胆提意见。根据以上情况，市委领导各区各厂分别召开了干部会、职工大会、小型座谈会等，通过总结1958年大跃进的经验，肯定成绩，提出问题，说明开展编整工作的意义、目的和要求，并运用大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报的方法引导群众，正确地认识1958年的大跃进，明确编整工作的重要性和必要性，从而使编整工作迅速顺利地开展了。如和平电器厂通过深入思想发动，很快地掀起了搞好生产和编整工作的热潮。几天内，工人们就贴出了一百二十多张大字报，其中不少意见对提高企业管理水平、促进生产更大跃进极其有益。
    在思想发动的基础上，根据本单位的具体情况和生产需要，各厂大抓企业管理工作，本着先易后难，从粗到细的精神，着手建立和健全一些必要的生产责任制度，以适应生产更大跃进的需要。如由三个性质相同、业务相近的五金机械单位并成的城南机械厂，在编整过程中，大力加强了管理工作，初步健全了原材料收发保管、财务开支、质量检验制度，实行了“五定”（定人、定机床、定产品、定产量、定质量）、“三建账”（现金收支建账、收发保管建账，公共财物建账）、“一审批”（需要添置的工具、设备要经过一定的审批手续），并将生产计划下达到车间、小组一直到个人，向群众进行任务、关键、措施三交底，贯彻了领导、技术人员、工人三结合。由于管理工作的加强和责任制度的建立，工人们的生产责任心大大加强，跃进劲头更足，1月份超额一倍多完成了跃进计划。
    通过编整，也更加明确了街道工业的服务方向，克服了过去有些厂子愿搞制造、成批生产，不愿搞修配、零星活的思想。由七个民办小五金厂并成的城北五金机械厂在端正服务方向后，明确了街道工业必须以修配为主，制造为辅，一手抓修配，一手抓制造，大大扩充了修配业务。今年以来，该厂修配的抽水机、锄头、耙头、洋铲、斧头等工具达三千多件，有力地支援了工农业生产，使1月份超额44.4％完成了生产计划，比去年12月份提高了43％。
    衡阳市许多工厂通过一手抓生产，一手抓编整巩固和提高工作，掀起了新的更大跃进的生产高潮。广大职工群众大闹技术革命。据三个城区的统计，区属和民办工厂1月份共提出了三千九百一十九件革新建议，实现一千七百三十九件，其中九百三十一件全年节约价值即达一百零五万九千余元。
