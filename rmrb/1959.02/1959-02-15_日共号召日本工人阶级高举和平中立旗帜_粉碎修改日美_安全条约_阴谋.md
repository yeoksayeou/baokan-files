Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th. The Central Committee Cadre Council of the Japanese Communist Party published a statement in the "Akahata" today, calling on all members of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese working class to "hold high the banner of peace and neutrality to smash the conspiracy to revise the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty."

The statement pointed out that the issue of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" has entered a new and important stage. The Kishi Nobusuke group has recently repeatedly stated that it will hold the signing of the revised "Security Treaty" in March or April. This shows that the Kishi Nobusuke government, supported by the U.S. and Japanese reactionary forces, is attempting to reverse the unfavorable situation it has faced since its defeat in the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," and to further launch an active attack on the Japanese people in order to realize its attempt to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The statement said that the U.S. and Japanese reactionary forces, under the guise of "equality," are conspiring to turn the "Security Treaty" into a U.S.-Japan "joint defense" treaty, which is their true purpose. The statement pointed out that if their conspiracy is allowed to succeed, Japan will be forever subordinate to the United States. When the United States launches a war of aggression, Japan will be mobilized by the United States. At the same time, the United States will transport nuclear weapons into Japan and carry out nuclear armament of Japan. At the same time, the United States will also retain the legal right to demand that Japan conduct joint operations with the United States.

The statement pointed out that the Japanese democratic forces have been continuing their struggle since launching the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," and the demands of the Japanese people have become the center of current Japanese political issues. The united front aimed at smashing the U.S.-Japan "security guarantee system" is also rapidly expanding.

The statement said that under this situation, the Communists must clarify the major situation currently facing the people in order to break the absurd political propaganda of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, and at the same time launch activities to rapidly create a public opinion of the entire people to prevent the Kishi Nobusuke government from conducting secret diplomacy and conspiring to revise the "Security Treaty."

The statement emphasized that, in response to the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's policy of revising the "Security Treaty," the Japanese Communist Party must raise the issue of Japan's neutrality to the entire people, which is the most important task of the Japanese Communist Party at present. The statement said that whether to adhere to and strengthen the U.S.-Japan military alliance as Japan's basic policy, or to get rid of this military alliance and take the road of independence, peace, and neutrality as Japan's basic policy, is the most important issue at present.

The statement pointed out that Japan's goals of breaking away from its subordinate relationship with the United States and becoming an independent country; defending Japan's security; promoting the normalization of relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and China; promoting Japan's friendly relations and trade with China and the Soviet Union; expanding economic and cultural exchanges with Asian countries, as a member of the Asian family; and ensuring Japan's peaceful development and creating conditions for improving the people's lives, cannot be realized as long as Japan adheres to and strengthens the policy of U.S.-Japan military alliance. The statement pointed out that Japan must break away from the U.S.-Japan military alliance, express its non-participation in any military alliance, and establish equal and friendly relations with all countries in the world. Only by implementing this policy of peace and neutrality can the above goals be achieved.

The statement pointed out that the Japanese working class and its vanguard Communist Party must hold high the banner of peace and neutrality, concentrate the strength of the people, and stand at the forefront of the struggle to smash the conspiracy of the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance and strive for Japan's true independence and ensure world peace. This is a major task currently undertaken by the Communist Party and the working class.

### 日共号召日本工人阶级高举和平中立旗帜  粉碎修改日美“安全条约”阴谋

    日共号召日本工人阶级高举和平中立旗帜
    粉碎修改日美“安全条约”阴谋
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会今天在“赤旗报”上发表声明，号召日共全体党员和日本工人阶级“高举着和平与中立的旗帜，粉碎修改日美安全条约的阴谋”。
    声明指出，修改日美“安全条约”的问题已经进入新的重要阶段。岸信介集团最近一再表示将在3、4月间举行修改“安全条约”的签字，这表明岸信介政府在美日反动势力的支撑下，企图挽回它在修改“警察官职务执行法”问题上遭到失败以来的不利局面，并且进一步对日本人民发动积极的进攻，以便实现其修改日美“安全条约”的企图。
    声明说，美日反动势力假借“平等”之名，阴谋把“安全条约”变成日美“共同防卫”条约，这是它们的真正目的。声明指出，倘若允许它们的这种阴谋实现，日本将永远从属于美国，在美国发动侵略战争的时候，日本将被美国动员起来，同时美国将把核武器运进日本并对日本进行核武装，同时美国也就保有要求日本同美国进行共同作战的合法权利。
    声明指出，日本民主力量自从展开反对修改“警职法”斗争以来一直在继续进行着斗争，日本人民的这些要求已经成为当前日本政治问题的中心，以粉碎日美“安全保障体系”为目标的统一战线也在迅速扩展着。
    声明说，在这种形势下，共产党人必须向人民阐明目前所面临的重大局面，以打破岸信介内阁的荒谬的政治宣传，同时展开活动，为迅速掀起一个全体人民阻止岸信介政府进行秘密外交和修改“安全条约”阴谋的舆论而努力。
    声明强调指出，针对着岸信介内阁进行修改“安全条约”的政策，日共必须对全体人民提出日本中立的问题，这是日共目前的最重要工作。声明说，是把坚持和加强日美军事同盟关系作为日本的基本政策还是把摆脱这个军事同盟走自主、和平、中立的道路作为日本的基本政策，这是当前最重要的问题。
    声明指出，日本摆脱对美从属关系成为独立国家；保卫日本的安全；促使日本同苏联、中国的关系正常化；促进日本同中苏的友好关系和发展贸易；扩大同亚洲各国的经济、文化交流，作为亚洲大家庭的一个成员；保障日本的和平发展、创造提高人民生活的条件等目标，只要日本还坚持和加强日美军事同盟关系的政策，这些就不能实现。声明指出，日本必须脱离日美军事同盟，表示不参加任何军事同盟，并且同全世界各国建立平等、友好关系，只有执行这种和平、中立政策才能实现上述目标。
    声明指出，日本工人阶级和它的先锋队共产党必须高举着和平、中立的旗帜，集中人民群众的力量，站在粉碎侵略性美日军事同盟阴谋和争取日本的真正独立以及确保世界和平斗争的前头。这是共产党和工人阶级目前所承担的重大任务。
