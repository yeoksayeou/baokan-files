The Jingxi Mining Bureau's Advanced Producers Representative Conference, held from the 19th to the 21st, based on summarizing the experiences of the Great Leap Forward last year, proposed an even greater Leap Forward plan for this year: after increasing coal production by 71% over the previous year to reach 4.06 million tons, to further increase coal production to 7 million tons this year. At the same time, it put forward the fighting slogan of "Efficiency Catches Jiao Zuo, Costs Catch Yangquan."

How to catch up with advanced units and achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive Leap Forward? Two roads were laid out before the workers of this bureau: one was to increase the number of coal mining faces by more than double, which would entail increasing the labor force and equipment by about double; the other was to increase the output per unit area (coal mining face) and achieve large-scale high yields, which would allow for no increase or a small increase in people and equipment. The Party committee of this bureau affirmed the second road.

In order to give each mine specific goals to strive for, at this conference, in addition to putting forward the call to "Catch Jiao Zuo, Catch Yangquan," the specific requirements for large-area high yield were also announced. Clear goals and specific technical measures further encouraged everyone to compete with, learn from, and catch up with the advanced. The representatives of the units present at the meeting expressed to the Bureau Party Committee their determination to strive for advancement.

During the conference, a vigorous production competition climax was set off among the workers of all mines in the bureau. Good news was frequently reported at the meeting, with forty-seven units reporting to the conference with the practical action of overfulfilling their daily plans. The Mentougou Mine had a planned excavation footage of 81 meters on the 19th, but actually completed 146 meters, setting a new record for the highest daily footage in the bureau. The Wangping Village Engineering Office planned 1.3 meters for rock excavation, but completed 7.4 meters, increasing it by four times compared to the original plan. After the conclusion of the conference, all units under this bureau have immediately taken action to implement the spirit of the conference.

    效率赶焦作　成本赶阳泉
    京西矿先进生产者提出努力目标
    本报讯　19日到21日举行的京西矿务局先进生产者代表大会，在总结去年大跃进经验的基础上，提出了今年更大的跃进计划：在去年比前年增产71％使煤产量达到四百零六万吨以后，今年再把煤产量提高到七百万吨。同时提出了“效率赶焦作，成本赶阳泉”的战斗口号。
    怎样赶上先进单位，实现更大更好更全面的跃进？摆在这个局职工面前的道路有两条：一条是增加一倍以上的采煤工作面，随之而来的是增加一倍左右的劳动力和设备；一条是提高单位面积（采煤工作面）产量，实现大面积的丰产，这样作可以不增加或少增加人和设备。这个局的党委肯定了第二条道路。
    为使各矿有具体奋斗目标，在这次大会上，除提出“追焦作，赶阳泉”的号召外，还宣布了大面积丰产的具体要求。明确的奋斗目标和具体的技术措施，进一步鼓舞了大家比先进、学先进、赶先进的劲头。到会各单位的代表，纷纷向局党委表示了力争先进的决心。
    在会议期间，全局各矿职工掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的生产竞赛高潮。会场上捷报频传，有四十七个单位以超额完成日计划的实际行动向大会报喜。门头沟矿19日掘进进尺计划八十一公尺，实际完成一百四十六公尺，创全局日进尺最高纪录。王平村工程处岩石掘进计划一点三公尺，却完成了七点四公尺，比原计划提高四倍。在大会结束以后，这个局所属各单位已立即分头用实际行动贯彻执行大会的精神。
