    Guangxi and Chongqing Commercial Departments Help Local Areas Develop Light Industry

    This newspaper's Nanning dispatch on the 4th: Guangxi's commercial departments are actively assisting local industrial departments in self-reliantly producing daily-use industrial products such as general merchandise and hardware, supplying local market needs.

    Guangxi's light industry foundation was very weak in the past, with about 80% of textiles, general merchandise, knitwear, cultural goods, and other industrial products relying on supplies from other provinces. In order to better supply market needs, the leading organs of Guangxi's commercial departments criticized some cadres' reliance on the idea of ​​"looking outward and reaching upward," emphasizing facing the local area, relying on the local area, and assisting the local area to obtain materials locally, produce locally, and supply locally.

    From the fourth quarter of last year, Guangxi's commercial departments have been conducting in-depth understanding and research of market conditions, assisting industrial departments in formulating plans and arranging production. The commercial departments in some areas have also sent cadres to factories frequently to help solve problems such as raw materials, equipment, and funds. The Nanning Municipal Commercial Department once assisted the Nanning Chemical Plant No. 2 in using acidic white clay to manufacture soap; dispatched cadres to various counties to purchase waste rubber, waste glass, and cowhide to help rubber, chemical, and leather factories solve the problem of insufficient raw material supply. The Nanning General Merchandise Wholesale Station also helped the textile factory change the take-up machine from the original single-head machine to a double-head machine, increasing work efficiency by 70%.

    With the active assistance of the commercial departments, Guangxi's production of daily-use industrial products has greatly developed. Nanning City, which was previously unable to produce enamel mugs, coarse canvas, thermos bottles, gas lamps, etc., can now produce them. The output of soap, paper, etc., has increased; matches, batteries, etc., can now basically be self-sufficient. The total value of industrial products produced in Wuzhou City in 1958 increased by 60% compared with 1957, and the variety increased by 568.

    In order to promote a greater leap forward in the production of daily-use industrial products, Guangxi's industrial and commercial departments recently jointly studied and determined the 1959 local industrial production plan. This year, local sources will reach 50% to 60%.

    This newspaper's Chongqing dispatch on the 4th: While vigorously organizing sources of goods for small and medium-sized cities and rural areas, Chongqing's commercial departments are actively helping small and medium-sized cities in Sichuan to establish general merchandise and cultural goods industries, as well as raw material processing industries. At present, some general merchandise and cultural goods have begun to be produced, and supplied locally in small and medium-sized cities.

    According to the recent arrangements of the two wholesale stations for general merchandise and cultural goods, each station has dozens of commodities that can be delegated to small and medium-sized cities for local production and supply. These include soap, towels, socks, gloves, cloth shoes, as well as minor cultural goods and wooden sports equipment. The characteristics of these commodities are: the demand is large in small and medium-sized cities and rural areas; the technology and equipment for producing these commodities are simple, and raw materials can be solved locally.

    In the past, Chongqing transported bamboo materials from rural areas to manufacture thermos bottle bamboo shells. In the fourth quarter of last year, the Chongqing General Merchandise Wholesale Station helped establish processing factories in bamboo-producing areas. Now, more than ten counties including Neijiang and Rongxian have been able to produce water bottle bamboo shells. Since the fourth quarter of last year, these areas have only purchased inner flasks from Chongqing and assembled more than 48,000 bamboo shell thermos bottles locally. Chongqing's commercial departments have also helped various places establish some raw material processing factories. The oil refinery jointly operated by the Chongqing Commercial Department and the Nanchong Prefecture Industrial Department will produce batches of gasoline, kerosene, diesel, lubricating oil, etc., to supply the needs of industrial construction.

    Chongqing's commercial departments help small and medium-sized cities establish daily-use industrial products, which not only increases social products, but also reduces commodity circulation links. This cooperative relationship between industrial and commercial departments in large and small cities is conducive to jointly undertaking the supply of daily necessities in the vast rural areas.

    扩大货源，减少流转环节
    就地生产日用品
    广西重庆商业部门帮助地方发展轻业工
    本报南宁4日电　广西商业部门积极协助地方工业部门自力更生地生产百货、五金等日用工业品，就地供应市场需要。
    广西过去轻工业基础很薄弱，纺织、百货、针织、文化等工业品80％左右都靠外省供应。为了更好地供应市场需要，广西商业部门领导机关批判了部分干部“眼睛向外，伸手向上”的依赖思想，强调面向地方，依靠地方，协助地方就地取材，就地生产，就地供应。
    从去年第四季度起，广西商业部门就深入了解和研究市场情况，协助工业部门制定规划，安排生产。有的地区的商业部门还派干部经常深入工厂，帮助解决原料、设备、资金等问题。南宁市商业部门曾经协助南宁化工二厂用酸性白泥制造肥皂；派干部到各县收购废胶、废玻璃和牛皮，帮助橡胶、化工、皮革工厂解决部分原料供应不足的问题。南宁百货批发站还帮助纺织厂把上线机由原来的单头机改为双头机，提高工作效率70％。
    在商业部门的积极协助下，广西日用工业品生产有了较大的发展。南宁市以往不能生产的搪瓷口杯、粗帆布、热水瓶、汽灯等，现在已能生产。肥皂、纸张等增加了产量；火柴、电池等已能基本上自给。梧州市1958年生产的工业用品总值，比1957年增加60％，同时增加了五百六十八种品种。
    为了促进日用工业品生产的更大跃进，最近广西工商部门共同研究确定了1959年地方工业生产规划，今年地方货源将达50％到60％。
    本报重庆4日电　重庆商业部门在大力为中小城市和农村组织货源的同时，积极帮助四川中小城市就地兴办百货和文化用品工业，以及原材料加工工业。目前，一部分百货和文化用品已经开始在中小城市就地取材，就地生产，就地供应。
    根据百货和文化用品两个批发站最近的安排，两个站各有几十种商品可以下放到中小城市就地生产和供应。其中有：肥皂、毛巾、袜子、手套、布鞋以及小宗文化用品、木制体育器械等。这些商品的特点是：中小城市和农村需要量大；生产这些商品的技术和设备简单，原材料能就地解决。
    过去，重庆都是从农村运竹料来制造热水瓶竹壳，去年第四季度重庆百货批发站帮助竹子产区建立了加工厂。现在，内江、荣县等十多个县已经能生产水瓶竹壳。去年第四季度以来，这些地区只是向重庆购进瓶胆，就在当地装配了四万八千多个竹壳热水瓶。重庆商业部门还帮助各地建立了一些原材料加工厂。重庆商业部门同南充专区工业部门合办的炼油厂，将成批生产汽油、煤油、柴油、润化油等，供应工业建设需要。
    重庆商业部门帮助中小城市兴办日用品工业，既增加了社会产品，又减少了商品流转环节。大城市和中小城市工商部门的这种协作关系，有利于共同担负广大农村日用品的供应工作。
