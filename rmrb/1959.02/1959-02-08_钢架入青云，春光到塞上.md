    Steel Frames Ascend to the Clouds, Spring Arrives in the Borderlands
    (Our Dispatch from Baotou, 7th) On the first day of Lichun (Start of Spring), the lights of the night shift on the Baotou Steel construction site had not yet been extinguished when tens of thousands of day-shift workers surged in like a tide. At the construction site of the blast furnace, the Electric Welder's Song rang out: "The electric welder hums and buzzes, emitting sparks of blue light, connecting steel frames to ascend to the clouds, a scene of spring arrives in the borderlands.”
    As soon as the electric welder masters started work, they said to their apprentices: "The weather is getting warmer, young men, let's take you to the blast furnace!" Several young men, not yet twenty years old, who were visiting such a tall blast furnace for the first time, climbed one after another to the eighth-floor platform, forty meters above the ground, to work. Their masters climbed to over sixty meters, sitting cross-legged on the steel frame, concentrating on welding the furnace top frame. The electric welders worked against the clock, striving to complete this blast furnace, which was only a few meters from the top, as soon as possible.
    Now, throughout the Baotou Steel plant area, there are red factory buildings, steel, and concrete structures everywhere. The construction site is crowded with people, the insulation project emits clouds of steam, trucks and tractors raise billowing dust on the crisscrossing roads, and trains and various cranes whistle everywhere. Spring has arrived, and the workers of the coking plant, refractory materials plant, thermal power plant, coal washing plant, water supply, and heat supply pipeline projects appear even more cheerful and busy, all fighting to produce iron as soon as possible, everyone wants to greet the Spring Festival with better results.

    钢架入青云，春光到塞上
    本报包头7日电　立春第一天，包钢工地上夜战的灯光还没熄灭，日班的几万工人就潮水般地涌来了。在高炉工地，唱起了电焊工之歌：“电焊机吱吱响，放出火花发蓝光，接起钢架上青云，一片春光度塞上”。
    电焊工师傅们一上班，就向徒工们说：“天暖了，小伙子们，带你们上高炉吧！”第一次来到这样高的高炉上的几个不满二十岁的小伙子，陆续爬到离地四十公尺高的第八层平台上工作。他们的师傅爬在六十多公尺高处，盘腿坐在钢架上，聚精会神地开始焊接炉顶框架。电焊工们分秒必争地工作着，争取把这座只差几公尺就要到顶的高炉早日建成。
    现在，包钢厂区到处尽是一幢幢红色的厂房、钢铁和混凝土建筑物。工地上人群扰攘，保暖工程冒着团团蒸汽，汽车和拖拉机在纵横的道路上扬起滚滚烟尘，火车和各种吊车四处鸣叫。春天到了，焦化厂、耐火材料厂、热电站、洗煤厂、输水和送热管道工程的工人们，显得更加愉快和忙碌，他们都在为早日出铁而战，人人都想以更好的成绩来迎接春节。
