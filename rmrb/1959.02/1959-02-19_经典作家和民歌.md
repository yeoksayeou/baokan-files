Classical Writers and Folk Songs
    Dong Rongsen

    This happened one hundred and twenty years ago. At that time, Marx was only in his early twenties and was studying at university. He extracted nineteen folk songs from many collections, copied them into a commemorative album, and dedicated it to Jenny, his future wife and comrade-in-arms. This commemorative album was a very special kind of "love letter" because Jenny's family was a declining aristocratic family and did not approve of this young lady's relationship with Marx. The folk songs selected in this commemorative album are mostly songs praising faithful love, but obviously also include some politically inclined folk songs that Marx particularly liked. The Rhine folk song "Ah, Strasbourg!" is one example. According to Liebknecht's memoirs, Marx and his family often liked to sing some "passionate" folk songs during walks in London. Sometimes the children would sing black folk songs, but they especially loved to sing "Ah, Strasbourg!"; it is clear that Marx always loved this song. This song describes the scene of soldiers in the old days fighting for the rulers, going to the battlefield, and their mothers and families being reluctant to part with them. The second to last paragraph says: "The soldiers left like this, marching with the troops to the battlefield. Leaving the young fiancée, weeping and sorrowing in her hometown." The ancient Greek ballad "Song of Freedom," one of the nineteen songs, is a political poem. The last two sentences say: "You overthrew the tyrants with strong hands and offered freedom anew to the motherland." The Romanian humorous folk song "Father Francesco," which satirizes priests, can be said to be a political satire of high artistic level. This song writes about the dialogue between the priest and his servant, vividly portraying a hypocritical gentleman. According to research, Marx did not hesitate to delete all vulgar elements when quoting these folk songs. It is said that when he copied a French humorous folk song "He said...", he deleted the first paragraph and started from the second paragraph. The song, after being abridged, is very interesting, and the tune is also very fresh.

    The Chinese translations of these nineteen folk songs are collected in "Folk Songs Collected by Marx and Engels" (People's Literature Publishing House edition), which is a type of literary booklet, and we are now fortunate to read it. This booklet also copies the other seven folk songs quoted by Marx and Engels in their works, including the British folk song "King Steam" quoted by Engels in "The Condition of the Working Class in England," including the "wonderful old Danish folk song" "Mr. Kidmann" mentioned by Engels, and "the only political folk song that has been popular in England for more than one hundred and sixty years"—"The Vicar of Bray," etc.

    Marx and Engels were very fond of poetry and had a high appreciation for it. They often quoted many lines of poetry in their works or conversations. It is said that Marx could recite passages from Dante's "Divine Comedy" by heart. In the preface to the first edition of "Das Kapital," Marx quoted two famous lines from "Divine Comedy": "Follow your own path, and let people talk!"; at the end of the preface to "A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy," Marx said that no matter how much his research on political economy goes against the prejudices of the ruling class, he will still do so. He then quoted two lines from Dante: "Here must be eradicated all hesitation; here any cowardice is of no use." In idle chats, they also loved to quote lines of poetry. According to the recollection of the daughter of Dr. Kugelmann, a close friend of Marx, Marx hated "sentimentality" the most; whenever someone showed sentimentality in front of him, he would quote a few lines of Heine's poetry. The poem says: "In the evening, a girl stood by the seashore, she sighed sadly—the red sun was setting." Isn't it too sentimental to sigh so sadly for the setting red sun? What a pungent satire. Therefore, I think that if a researcher could copy and collect the poems mentioned by Marx and Engels in their works and in the recollections of their contemporaries, it would be a meaningful and interesting thing.

    经典作家和民歌　
    栋榕森
    这是一百二十年前的事了。那时马克思还只有二十岁出头，正在大学里念书，他从许多集子里摘了十九首民歌，抄成一个纪念册，献给他后来的妻子和战友燕妮。这个纪念册是一种很别致的“情书”，因为燕妮的家是个破落的伯爵家庭，不赞成这位小姐跟马克思恋爱。这个纪念册所选录的民歌，大部分是歌颂忠贞的爱情的歌曲，但显然也包括一些马克思十分喜爱的有倾向性的民歌。莱茵民歌“啊，斯特拉斯堡！”就是一个例子。据李卜克内西的回忆录所说，马克思一家人在伦敦散步时往往喜欢唱一些“热情洋溢”的民歌，有时孩子们还唱黑人的民歌，但特别爱唱的就是“啊，斯特拉斯堡！”这一首；可见马克思对这首歌是始终爱好的。这首歌是写旧时代兵士们为统治者打仗，上战场，母亲家人依依不舍的情景的，最后第二段说：“兵士们就这样走了，随着队伍开往战场。留下年轻的未婚妻，在故乡流泪、悲伤。”十九首里面的古希腊歌谣“自由的歌”，则是一首政治诗。末尾的两句说：“你们用坚强的手推翻了暴君，把自由重新奉献给了祖邦。”一首讽刺神父的罗马尼亚诙谐民歌“弗朗车斯柯神父”，可以说是艺术水平很高的政治讽刺诗。这首歌写神父和他的小厮的对话，把一个虚伪的君子写得活龙活现。据研究家的考证说，马克思在引录这些民歌的时候，毫不吝惜地把一切庸俗的东西删掉的。据说他抄录一首法国的诙谐民歌“他说……”的时候，就是把第一段删掉，从第二段开始的。经过删节的这首歌十分有趣，调子也极新鲜。
    这十九首民歌的中译文，收在
  “马克思恩格斯收集的民歌”（人民文学出版社版）里，这是文学小丛书的一种，我们现在有幸运读到了。这本小册子还抄录了马、恩在他们的著作里引用过的其他七首民歌，包括恩格斯在“英国工人阶级状况”中引用过的英国民歌“蒸汽王”，包括恩格斯说的“绝妙的古丹麦民歌”“基德曼老爷”，和“一百六十多年来在英国一直受到欢迎的唯一的政治民歌”——“勃莱伊牧师”等等。
    马克思和恩格斯非常爱好诗歌，而且有很高的鉴赏力，他们常常在著作或谈话中引用许多诗句。据说马克思能成段成段地背诵但丁的“神曲”的。在“资本论”初版序里，马克思引用了“神曲”的两句名诗：“走自己的路，让人家去说吧！”；在“政治经济学批判”的序言末了，马克思说他研究政治经济学的结果，不管是多么不合乎统治阶级的偏见，也还是要这样做的。他又引用但丁的两句诗：“这里必须根绝一切犹豫，这里任何懦怯都无济于事。”在闲谈中他们也爱引用诗句。据马克思的密友库格曼博士的女儿回忆，马克思最讨厌人家“多愁善感”；凡是有人在他面前表现出多愁善感，他就要引海?的几句诗了。诗曰：“傍晚，有位姑娘伫立海滨，她悲哀地叹息——红日西沉。”红日西沉也值得如此悲哀地叹息，岂不是过于多愁善感么？这是多么辛辣的讽刺呵。因此，我想，如果有研究家把马、恩两人著作和同时代人的回忆里面提到他们所引用的诗篇抄录成集，将会是一件有意义而且有兴趣的事。
