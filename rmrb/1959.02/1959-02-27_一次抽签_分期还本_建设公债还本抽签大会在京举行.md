    One-Time Lottery, Installment Repayment
    National Construction Bond Redemption Lottery Held in Beijing
    Ministry of Finance Announces 1958 National Construction Bond Redemption and Interest Payment Measures
    The 1954-1958 five-year National Economic Construction Bond redemption lottery was held in Beijing on the 25th.
    In addition to drawing the winning numbers for the 1959 annual redemption of the five-year bonds as stipulated, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress decided to cease issuing national bonds from this year onwards. The Ministry of Finance, with the approval of the State Council, also drew and announced the winning numbers for each year after 1959 for the five-year bonds at this redemption lottery. Future annual lotteries will no longer be held. Instead, the winning numbers for each year will be re-announced before the start of redemption and interest payments on September 30th each year. This centralized, one-time lottery method can greatly simplify the annual redemption lottery procedures for the five-year bonds, allowing bondholders to understand all the winning numbers for future years in a single instance.
    Representatives from all walks of life, including employees of central state organs, Beijing business community members, and street residents, participated in the redemption lottery. Representatives from the Fifth Office of the State Council and the Ministry of Supervision attended to supervise the lottery. Representatives from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce each executed the drawing. At the meeting, thirty-five winning numbers were drawn for the year 1959, including fifteen winning numbers for the 1954 National Economic Construction Bond, and five winning numbers each for the 1955, 1956, 1957, and 1958 National Economic Construction Bonds. The meeting also drew a total of four hundred and five winning numbers for redemption each year from 1960 to 1968.
    Bei Zhongxuan, Assistant Minister of Finance, who presided over the meeting, spoke about the positive role that the five consecutive issues of National Economic Construction Bonds from 1954 to 1958 played in China's socialist construction, as well as the contribution of those who purchased the bonds to the country's construction efforts.
    According to our newspaper, the Ministry of Finance issued the measures for the redemption and interest payment of the 1958 National Economic Construction Bond on February 20th. The full text of the measures is as follows:
    I. These measures are formulated in accordance with Articles 5, 6, and 7 of the 1958 National Economic Construction Bond Regulations.
    II. The principal of the 1958 National Economic Construction Bond will be repaid in ten installments from 1959 to 1968. A lottery will be held in Beijing on February 25, 1959, inviting representatives from all walks of life to supervise the execution, and all winning numbers for each year will be drawn in a centralized manner. Redemption will be announced annually based on the winning numbers. Any bond number with the last two digits matching the announced winning numbers for the year will be considered a winning bond for redemption.
    III. The People's Bank of China shall handle the redemption and interest payment of this bond. The winning numbers for redemption shall be based solely on the announcements made by the Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China.
    IV. During the redemption period of this bond, the redemption period is from September 30th to December 31st each year, during which local People's Banks will verify and redeem the bonds. To protect the interests of bondholders, any winning bonds not collected during the redemption period may continue to be collected during the next redemption period. All winning bonds from all periods must be redeemed before September 30, 1969 (including the extended redemption period of 9 months), otherwise, the claim will become invalid and will not be redeemed.
    V. If the principal of the bonds that should be redeemed each time is not collected upon maturity, interest will continue to be paid on the principal at the original interest rate until it is collected.
    VI. Interest on this bond will be paid in one lump sum along with the principal of the winning bond.
    VII. The redemption of damaged or defaced bonds shall be handled in accordance with the "Measures for the Handling of Redemption of Damaged or Defaced National Bond Certificates."
    VIII. The redemption of this bond shall be based solely on the bond certificate and will not be subject to replacement in case of loss.
    IX. These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation.
                  Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China, February 20, 1959

    一次抽签  分期还本
    建设公债还本抽签大会在京举行
    财政部公布一九五八年建设公债还本付息办法
    据新华社26日讯　1954—1958年五期国家经济建设公债还本抽签大会25日在北京举行。
    这次抽签，除了按照规定抽出五期公债的1959年度应该还本的中签号码以外，由于人大常委会决定从今年起停止发行全国性公债，财政部报请国务院批准，在这次还本抽签大会上，把五期公债1959年度以后每年应该还本的中签号码也同时抽出来，予以公布。今后不再每年举行抽签，只是在每年9月30日开始还本付息以前，再把各期公债在该年度的中签号码重新公布一次。采取这种集中一次抽签的方式，可以大大简化五期公债以后每年举行还本抽签的手续，可以使持有公债券的人一次了解到五期公债今后各年度的全部还本中签号码。
    参加这次还本抽签大会的有中央国家机关的职工、北京市工商界人士、街道居民等各界代表。国务院第五办公室和监察部代表出席监督抽签。中华全国总工会和中华全国工商业联合会代表各一人执行抽签。会上抽出了1959年度的中签号码三十五个，其中：1954年国家经济建设公债中签号码十五个；1955年、1956年、1957年和1958年的国家经济建设公债中签号码各五个。大会还抽出了1960年到1968年每年应该还本的中签号码共四百零五个。
    主持大会的财政部部长助理贝仲选在致词中谈到从1954年到1958年国家连续发行五期国家经济建设公债，对我国社会主义建设事业所起的积极作用，以及购买公债的人对国家建设事业的贡献。
    本报讯　财政部于2月20日发布了1958年国家经济建设公债还本付息办法。办法全文如下：
    一、本办法根据1958年国家经济建设公债条例第五、六、七条制定。
    二、1958年国家经济建设公债本金，分别自1959年起至1968年止分十年作十次偿还。定于1959年2月25日在北京举行一次抽签，邀请各界代表到场监督执行，集中把各年度中签号码全部抽出，每年根据中签号码公告还本一次。凡债券号码末尾两字与当年中签号码公告相同的，即为中签还本债券。
    三、本公债由中国人民银行办理还本和付息事宜。中签债券一律以中华人民共和国财政部各次通告的中签号码为准。
    四、本公债在还本年限内，每年9月30日至12月31日为兑付期，由各地人民银行验券兑付。为照顾持券人利益，凡本次中签债券未在兑付期内领取的，可继续在下次兑付期内领取。所有各次中签债券应在1969年9月30日（包括延长兑付期9个月）以前兑取完毕，否则债权即失时效，不予兑付。
    五、每次中签应当还本的债券，到期如不领取本金的，其本金仍按原定利率计付利息，直到领取时为止。
    六、本公债利息，随中签债券的本金一次付给。
    七、残破污损债券的兑付，按照“国家公债债券残破污损兑付处理办法”的规定办理。
    八、本公债的偿还，概凭债券兑付，不予挂失。
    九、本办法自公布之日起施行。
                  中华人民共和国财政部　　1959年2月20日
