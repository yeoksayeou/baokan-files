　　Making Mechanical Equipment with Porcelain Instead of Steel
　　This newspaper reports that, at the national light industry conference held in Zhengzhou in July of last year, the Ministry of Light Industry proposed the task of using ceramics instead of steel to trial-produce light industrial equipment, and determined that trial production should be carried out in ceramic bases such as Yixing, Jingdezhen, Liling, Shiwan, Tangshan, and Jinzhou. After half a year of hard work, great achievements have been made in manufacturing mechanical equipment with ceramics. As of now, sixty-three types of ceramic mechanical equipment have been successfully trial-produced and are operating well. Among the main equipment, in addition to paper-making machine drying cylinders, alcohol distillation towers, and oil leaching apparatuses, there are also 300 mm caliber water pumps, blowers, lathes, motor casings, and sulfuric acid towers. Among these main equipments, except for lathes, the other equipments have already begun mass production.
　　The successful trial production of ceramics instead of steel is a very meaningful technical revolution in the field of light industry. It means that China's ceramic industry, with its thousands of years of glorious history, has embarked on a new field of mechanical ceramics.
　　In the trial-produced light industrial equipment, the ceramic drying cylinder is a cutting-edge equipment. In terms of its performance, it requires high thermal stability, good heat transfer efficiency, high mechanical strength, smooth surface, and small dimensional tolerances. In terms of manufacturing technology, due to its complex structure, large volume, varying thickness, and strict performance requirements, it poses very high technical requirements. To produce this equipment, it is necessary to overcome five difficulties: ingredient mixing, molding, drying, firing, and machining. In order to adapt to the mechanical strength and thermal stability of the ceramic drying cylinder, it is very important to determine what clay materials to use. Because the ceramic drying cylinder is large in volume, complex in shape, varies in thickness, and has strict dimensions, it is also necessary to conduct very detailed experimental research to determine which molding method, drying method, and firing temperature curve to adopt. During the trial production of the ceramic drying cylinder, these technical difficulties have been solved one by one under the correct leadership of the Party and the full mobilization of the masses. Through the trial production of ceramic drying cylinders, we have gained a further understanding and mastery of ceramic properties, enabling the ceramic industry not only to produce general containers for daily use and acid-resistant equipment for industry, but also to produce various mechanical and physical properties of rotating mechanical equipment, thus opening the door to the production of mechanical equipment with ceramics. This new achievement of the ceramic industry proves that the guiding ideology of the Ministry of Light Industry's Zhengzhou Conference to take ceramic drying cylinders as the key to drive the production of other industrial ceramic equipment is correct.
　　Recently, the Ministry of Light Industry also held an on-site conference in Yixing, with the participation of more than ten provinces and cities, on manufacturing mechanical equipment with ceramics instead of steel. The conference successfully summarized a complete series of experiences in ingredient mixing, molding, drying, firing, and assembly, unified the understanding of using ceramics instead of steel, laid the foundation for confidence in the production of ceramic machinery, and pointed out the direction. The conference also decided to expand the trial production of new products.
　　Now, the ceramic industry is gradually expanding its service objects, and new varieties of ceramic equipment have begun to be continuously trial-produced. It is entirely foreseeable that China's ceramic industry, with its glorious history, will have even greater development in 1959.

    以瓷代钢大造机械设备
    本报讯　轻工业部去年7月在郑州召开的全国轻工业会议上，提出了以陶瓷代钢铁试制轻工业设备的任务，并确定在宜兴、景德镇、醴陵、石湾、唐山和锦州等陶瓷基地进行试制工作。经过半年来的奋战，用陶瓷制造机器设备，已经获得很大成就。截至目前为止，已试制成功运转良好的陶瓷机械设备有六十三种，其中主要设备除造纸机烘缸、酒精蒸馏塔和油脂浸出器外，还有三百公厘口径的水泵、鼓风机、车床、马达外壳和硫酸塔等。在这些主要设备当中，除车床以外，其他设备都已经开始成批生产。
    陶瓷代钢铁的试制成功，是轻工业领域中一项很有意义的技术革命，它意味着我国有几千年光辉历史的陶瓷工业，走上了机械陶瓷的新领域。
    在试制的轻工业设备中，陶瓷烘缸是个尖端的设备，就它的使用性能来说，它要求热稳定性高、传热效能好、机械强度大、表面平滑、尺寸公差小；就制造工艺来说，由于构造复杂，体积庞大，厚薄不一，使用性能要求严格，因此它提出的技术要求很高，生产这种设备，必须过好五关，即配料、成型、干燥、烧成和机械加工。为了适应陶瓷烘缸的机械强度和热稳定性，用什么泥料配制是很重要的关键；因陶瓷烘缸体积庞大，形态复杂，厚薄不一，尺寸严格，采用哪一种成型方法、干燥方法和烧成温度曲线，也都需要进行很细致的试验研究。这些技术难关，在陶瓷烘缸的试制过程中，由于党的正确领导，充分发动群众，都一一解决了。通过陶瓷烘缸的试制工作，对于陶瓷性能有了进一步的认识和掌握，使陶瓷工业不仅只能生产日用的一般容器和工业的耐酸设备，而且能够生产各种机械和物理性能的回转的机械设备，从而打开了用陶瓷生产机械设备的大门。陶瓷工业这一新的成就，证明轻工业部郑州会议决定以陶瓷烘缸为纲带动其他工业陶瓷设备生产的指导思想是正确的。
    最近，轻工业部又在宜兴召开了有十多个省市参加的以陶瓷代替钢铁制造机械设备的现场会议，成功地总结了配料、成型、干燥、烧成和装配等一系列的完整的经验，统一了以陶瓷代替钢铁的认识，奠定了生产陶瓷机械的信心指出了方向，会议并决定扩大新产品的试制工作。
    现在，陶瓷工业正在逐步扩大其服务对象，新的陶瓷设备品种已开始不断的试制生产出来。完全可以预计，我国有着光辉历史的陶瓷工业，在1959年将有更长足的发展。
