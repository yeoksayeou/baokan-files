    Thoughts on a Titleless Piece
    Zhong Huai
    A missing screw can cause a machine to run poorly or even not at all; a missing part can stop a bicycle from moving or a radio from working... From this, people recognize the importance of screws and accessories.
    But do you often recognize your own importance, if your job is like a screw or an accessory?
    Do you often respect others, if their job is like a screw or an accessory?

    Not long ago, the resolution made by the Second Shanghai Municipal Congress of the CPC stated:
    Not only should we care for the masses in terms of material life, but also comprehensively care for them in terms of political thought, learning, and
      technology, helping workers continuously improve their political and ideological level and cultural and technical level.
    I think this is a good statement. This is truly seeing both the object and the person.
    Not only seeing half a person—a person's material life, but seeing the whole person—plus a person's spiritual life.
    Not only seeing ordinary people, but seeing people determined to achieve a greater leap forward—therefore, so much emphasis is placed on learning and improving technical skills.

    缺一颗螺丝钉，机器开动不好甚至开动不了；少一种零件，自行车动不起来，收音机响不起来……人们从这里认识了螺丝钉和配件的重要性。
    但是你是否经常认识到你自己的重要性，如果你的工作岗位也像一颗螺丝钉或者一个配件？
    你是否经常尊重别人，如果他的工作岗位就像一颗螺丝钉或者一个配件？

    不久以前中共上海市二届代表大会所作的决议中谈到：
    不仅要从物质生活上关心群众，而且要从政治思想上、学习上、
      技术上全面地关心群众，帮助职工不断提高政治思想水平和文
      化技术水平。
    我以为这段话很好。这是真正的见物又见人。
    不是只见到了半个人——人的物质生活，而是见到了整个的人——加上人的精神生活。
    不是只见到了普通的人，而是见到了决心实现更大跃进的人——因此才如此强调学习和提高技术水平。
