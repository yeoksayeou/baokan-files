(Comprehensive report from our newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency: Newspapers in fraternal countries such as Romania, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Bulgaria, Poland, Albania, Hungary, Mongolia, North Korea, and Vietnam published editorials and commentaries on the 6th and 7th, warmly celebrating the victorious conclusion of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

	The Romanian newspaper "Scînteia" published a commentary saying that the 21st Congress of the CPSU has great significance for the high-speed development of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, for the development of all mankind, and for the noble cause of peace. It will be recorded in world history as a great event.

	The commentary went on to say that the 21st Congress of the CPSU demonstrated the strength and unity of the international workers' movement and the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp and the communist parties of all countries. Only imperialists and revisionists who attempt to split the socialist forces will be annoyed by this situation.

	The editorial of the Czechoslovak newspaper "Rudé Právo" stated that the 21st Congress of the CPSU was a great victory for Marxist-Leninist thought, pointing out a bright future for all communist and workers' parties, as well as all working people. The seven-year plan adopted by the congress is a leap-forward plan that not only solves the Soviet Union's tasks on the road to communism, but will also further strengthen the socialist camp.

	The German Democratic Republic's "Neues Deutschland" emphasized that the part of Khrushchev's speech concerning the German question is of particular importance. The newspaper said that it is unwise to concentrate atomic and rocket weapons in West Germany, and a wise policy requires cooperation between East and West. The newspaper also quoted Khrushchev's metaphor, saying that the time bomb of West Berlin must be removed.
	
	A commentary in the Bulgarian newspaper "Trud" wrote that the 21st Congress of the CPSU will be recorded in the history of the Soviet people and the entire international communist and workers' movement as a particularly important event of world historical significance.

	The commentary said: "The people of socialist countries are watching the congress with joy and excitement because the congress resolutions further illuminate their upcoming beautiful communist future and make them more convinced that the path they are taking is correct. At the same time, the congress resolutions have made the leading groups in the capitalist camp dizzy. It is becoming clearer that the capitalist world has a very bleak future, and in the peaceful economic competition in recent years, it is bound to collapse in the end."

	The Polish newspaper "Głos Pracy" published an editorial saying that the 21st Congress of the CPSU caused deep unease among the imperialists, but for the working people, the great plan of the congress aroused joy. The editorial said that the 21st Congress strengthened the fraternal friendship between the communist parties of various countries and the people of the socialist camp. The newspaper finally pointed out that for every Polish worker, the issues discussed at this CPSU congress are close to their hearts. The slogans put forward by the congress have received a warm response and support here.

	The Albanian newspaper "Zëri i Popullit" said in an editorial on the 7th: The resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU will be like a reliable compass, leading the fraternal Soviet people to the summit of communism. This congress once again demonstrated the solidarity and iron-like unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as well as the will of the Soviet people to complete the grand plan of communist construction and to strive to defend world peace; at the same time, it also powerfully demonstrated the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the strength and unity of the international communist movement. The editorial pointed out that this unity struck at the intrigues of the imperialist aggressive groups that have been defeated in the past and will always be defeated in the future, and at the lackeys of the imperialists, the Yugoslav revisionists.

	The Albanian newspaper "Bashkimi" published an editorial saying that the resolutions and the seven-year plan of the 21st Congress of the CPSU are of great significance for the further development of the socialist camp. With the help of the Soviet Union, the countries of the socialist camp will be able to build their economies and cultures at a very fast pace. The editorial said that the further consolidation of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp is a reliable foundation for all forces striving for peace and social progress.

	The Hungarian newspaper "Népszava", while emphasizing the great significance of the congress for the international communist movement, wrote that the congress demonstrated the unity of the socialist countries and the Leninist unity of the fraternal parties.

	The Mongolian newspaper "Ünen" pointed out in an editorial that the Soviet Union has always pursued a policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. The 21st Congress of the CPSU put forward clear and concrete proposals for solving international problems, and the Mongolian people fully support the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy.

	The editorial said that the 21st Congress of the CPSU dealt a heavy blow to modern revisionists, strictly defining the boundaries between communists and Yugoslav revisionists.

	The Korean newspaper "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial saying that the entire process of the CPSU congress demonstrated the unprecedented consolidation and unity of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The editorial said: "The realization of the huge tasks of the seven-year plan will greatly enhance the power of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, and at the same time, it is a powerful guarantee that socialism will be able to achieve a decisive victory in the peaceful competition with capitalism on a global scale."

	The editorial emphasized that the congress showed that today the international communist movement is stronger and more united than ever before, and the anti-Marxist theories and actions of the Yugoslav revisionists have been thoroughly crushed theoretically and practically through real life and the practice of the communist movement.

	The Vietnamese newspaper "Nhân Dân" pointed out in an editorial that the arguments on a series of theoretical issues mentioned in Khrushchev's report, such as the transition from socialism to communism and the prevention of imperialist aggressive wars, were further developed at the congress. These arguments have enriched the theoretical treasure house of Marxism-Leninism and have made extremely valuable contributions to the international communist and workers' movement, the liberation movement of oppressed nations, and the movement to safeguard world peace.

	The editorial said that Vietnamese communists take the Soviet communists as an example, resolutely follow the path of the Soviet Union, and resolutely smash all the conspiracies of the imperialists and revisionists.

    苏共决议照亮了共产主义的道路
    各兄弟国家报纸欢呼苏共代表大会成就
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、保加利亚、波兰、阿尔巴尼亚、匈牙利、蒙古、朝鲜和越南等兄弟国家的许多报纸，在6、7两日纷纷发表社论和评论，热烈庆祝苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的胜利闭幕。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”发表评论说，苏共第二十一次代表大会对苏联和其他社会主义国家的高速度发展、对全人类的发展和崇高的和平事业都具有重大意义，它将被作为一个伟大事件而载入世界史册。
    评论接着说，苏共第二十一次代表大会显示了国际工人运动的力量和团结，显示了社会主义阵营和世界各国共产党的牢不可破的团结。对这种情况，只有企图分裂社会主义力量的帝国主义者和修正主义分子才会感到恼怒。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”的社论说，苏共第二十一次代表大会是马克思列宁主义思想的巨大胜利，它给所有共产党和工人党以及全体劳动人民指出了光辉的未来。大会通过的七年计划是一个飞跃的计划，它不仅解决了苏联在向共产主义迈进道路上的任务，而且将进一步增强社会主义阵营的力量。
    德意志民主共和国“新德意志报”强调指出，赫鲁晓夫发言中关于德国问题的部分具有特别的重要性。报纸说，在西德集中原子武器和火箭武器是不明智的，明智的政策要求东西方合作。报纸还引用赫鲁晓夫的比喻说，必须除掉西柏林这枚延期炸弹。
  保加利亚“劳动报”的评论写道，苏共第二十一次代表大会将作为具有世界历史意义的特别重要事件而载入苏联人民和整个国际共产主义运动和工人运动的史册。
    评论说：“社会主义各国的人民都以欢欣鼓舞的心情注视着大会，因为大会决议更加照亮了他们的即将来临的美好的共产主义未来，使他们更加坚信他们所走的道路是正确的。同时，大会决议却使资本主义阵营的领导集团头昏脑胀。人们更加清楚地看到，资本主义世界前景十分暗淡，在最近几年的和平的经济竞赛中，它一定要最后溃败。”
  波兰“劳动之声报”发表社论说，苏共第二十一次代表大会引起了帝国主义深深的不安，但对于劳动人民来说，代表大会的伟大计划引起了喜悦。社论说，第二十一次代表大会加强了各国共产党和社会主义阵营各国人民之间的兄弟友谊。报纸最后指出，对于每个波兰工人来说，苏共这次代表大会所讨论的问题是亲近的。代表大会所提出的口号在我们这里得到了热烈的反应和支持。
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”7日在社论中说：苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议将像可靠的罗盘似地把兄弟的苏联人民带向共产主义的顶峰。这次代表大会又一次表现了苏联共产党的团结和钢铁般的一致，以及苏联人民为完成共产主义建设的宏伟计划，为保卫世界和平而奋斗的意志；同时，它也有力地显示了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营牢不可破的团结和国际共产主义运动的力量与团结。社论指出，这种团结打击了过去已遭到失败，而今后将永远遭到失败的帝国主义侵略集团的诡计，打击了帝国主义者的仆从南斯拉夫修正主义者。
    阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”发表社论说，苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议和七年计划对社会主义阵营的进一步发展具有巨大的意义。在苏联的帮助下，社会主义阵营各国将可能以非常快的速度来建设它们的经济和文化。社论说，苏联和社会主义阵营的进一步巩固，是争取和平和社会进步的一切力量的可靠的基础。
    匈牙利“人民之声报”在着重指出代表大会对国际共产主义运动的巨大意义时写道，代表大会显示了社会主义国家的团结、各兄弟党的列宁主义的团结。
    蒙古“真理报”在社论中指出，苏联始终执行着社会制度不同的国家之间和平共处的政策。苏共第二十一次代表大会在解决国际问题方面提出了明确而具体的建议，蒙古人民完全支持苏联的和平外交政策。
    社论说，苏共第二十一次代表大会给现代修正主义者以沉重的打击，严格地指出了共产主义者和南斯拉夫修正主义者的界限。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表社论说，苏共这次代表大会的整个过程显示了苏联共产党中央委员会的空前巩固和团结一致。社论说：“七年计划巨大任务的实现将使苏联和整个社会主义阵营的威力无比增强，同时也是在全世界范围内社会主义在同资本主义进行的和平竞赛中能够取得决定性胜利的有力保证”。
    社论强调指出，大会表明，今天国际共产主义运动比任何时候都更强大和团结一致，南斯拉夫修正主义者的反马克思主义的理论和行动，通过现实生活和共产主义运动的实践已从理论上和实际上被彻底粉碎了。
    越南“人民报”在社论中指出，赫鲁晓夫的报告中所提到的有关从社会主义过渡到共产主义、有关制止帝国主义侵略战争等一系列理论问题的论点在大会上得到了进一步的发展。这些论点丰富了马克思列宁主义的理论宝库，并对国际共产主义运动和工人运动，对被压迫民族的解放运动和维护世界和平的运动做出了极其宝贵的贡献。
    社论说，越南共产主义者以苏联共产党人为榜样，坚决走苏联的道路，坚决粉碎帝国主义者和修正主义者的一切阴谋。
