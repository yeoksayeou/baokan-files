How to Preserve Fertilizer
Liang Deyin

In the midst of a large-scale fertilizer accumulation movement, we must not only vigorously open up fertilizer sources to accumulate more fertilizer, but also do a good job in preserving fertilizer. This is because nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in fertilizers are easily lost if preservation is not taken seriously. Fertilizer that has lost nutrients may look similar to what it was before the loss on the outside, but the effect on fertilizing fields is much smaller. To maintain the quality of fertilizer, we must first pay attention to fertilizer preservation.

Production practice and scientific experiments have proven that fertilizer preservation is very important. Some departments have conducted such experiments: one hundred catties of human urine were stored in a jar. After seventy-six days, the nutrients in the urine were measured. The nitrogen loss in the open air was 57%, but the nitrogen loss in shaded and covered storage was only 7%.

Fertilizers should be well preserved during the composting and accumulation process, and before they are applied to avoid wind and rain. Among all kinds of farm manure, human and animal excrement and urine have the best fertilizer effect, but they are also the easiest to lose nutrients. In order to preserve human and animal excrement and urine well, some basic construction for fertilizer accumulation and preservation should be carried out in the fertilizer accumulation movement. In places where "six haves" and "eight haves" have not yet been realized, toilets, cattle pens, horse sheds, pigsties, etc. can be built quickly so that human and animal excrement and urine have fixed storage places. Existing stables should also be inspected and repaired to prevent livestock manure from being exposed to wind and rain.

Increasing bedding grass in stables is an important measure to maintain the quality of livestock manure and increase the amount of farmyard manure. Using dry fine soil, chopped straw, wheat straw, turf, etc. as bedding in stables and pigsties can absorb the nutrients in the manure, and is also of great benefit to the health of livestock. In rural areas of northern China, using soil as bedding is an inherent habit. Scientific experiments have proved that if no soil is added to pigsty urine, the nitrogen loss accounts for 80% of the total nitrogen in fifteen days; if four times the amount of fine soil is added for preservation, the loss is only 5%. Comparative experiments on the fertilizer effect of pigsty manure have also proved that applying pigsty manure with bedding soil yields seventy catties more corn per mu than applying pigsty manure without bedding soil.

However, the amount of soil added should not be too much. In the past, some places added more than 90% soil, which not only increased the amount of transportation, but also reduced the quality of the fertilizer. How much is appropriate? Generally, one part of manure should be added with three to four parts of fine soil; too little soil cannot absorb and store the fertilizer, and cannot play a role in preserving fertilizer.

In the south, chopped rice straw, turf, dry leaves, etc. should be added to the cattle pens as bedding grass, and it should be frequently replaced to improve the quality and quantity of fertilizer. In areas rich in peat, the peat can be crushed and added to livestock pens. Peat can absorb and store the fertilizer in the fertilizer and is a good material for bedding.

To more effectively preserve human excrement and urine, one should start with improving toilets. Build the toilet completely and without seams so that manure will not seep into the ground, and at the same time reduce the volatilization of nitrogen in human urine. The tiled urn-style latrines used in Henan, Guangxi and other provinces have a large belly and a small mouth, which can store a large amount and reduce volatilization. It is a good method for accumulating and preserving fertilizer. In short, the less ventilated and airtight the manure tank and manure cellar, the smaller the nitrogen loss.

The accumulated fertilizer, whether compost, farmyard manure, grass fertilizer, or green manure, should be piled in a shady place before application, and covered with soil to retain the fertilizer. According to experiments, compost that is covered with soil loses 18% less nitrogen than compost that is not covered with soil (both for one month). Practice has also proved that the effect of grass fertilizer, green manure, etc. is also much smaller when leached by rain.

The ashes of firewood after burning are also the best potash fertilizer. If they are exposed to wind and rain during storage, the nutrients will also be lost. Chemical fertilizers should be properly stored in dry and cool houses to avoid moisture and chemical changes.

    怎样保肥
    梁德印
    在大搞积肥运动的时候，一方面要大力开辟肥源多积肥料，同时还必须做好肥料的保存工作。因为肥料中的氮、磷、钾等养分，如果不注意保存，是很容易丢失的。肥料损失了养分，在外表上看起来和没有丢失养分以前差不多，可是肥田的效果就小多了。要保持肥料的质量，首先就要注意保肥工作。
    生产实践和科学的试验都证明保肥是很重要的。有的部门曾经做过这样的试验，用一百斤人尿，在缸内贮存，过七十六天以后，测定尿中的养分，露天放置的损失了57％的氮素，但遮阴加盖贮存的仅损失7％的氮素。
    肥料在堆沤和积制的过程中，在没有施用以前，都应该做好保肥工作，避免使肥料受到风吹雨淋。在各种农家肥料之中，肥效最好，但是也最容易丢失肥分的就是人、畜的粪尿。为了很好的保存人畜粪尿，在积肥运动中，应该进行一些积肥保肥的基本建设。在还没有实现“六有”“八有”的地方，可以快些修建起厕所、牛栏、马棚、猪圈等，使人、畜粪尿都有固定存放的处所。对已有的厩舍也要进行检查和修建，避免牲畜粪尿受到风吹雨淋。
    增加厩舍中的褥草是保持牲畜粪尿质量和增加厩肥数量的重要措施。用干细土、切碎的稻草、麦秸、草皮等物垫入厩舍、猪圈中，能吸收住粪尿中的养分，同时对牲畜的健康也有很大好处。在我国北方农村，用土垫圈是固有的习惯，科学试验证明，猪厩尿如果不加土，在十五天内，氮素的损失占总氮量的80％；加入四倍细土保存，则仅损失5％。在猪圈粪的肥效比较试验中也证明，施用垫土的猪圈粪比施用不垫土的猪圈粪，每亩多增收七十斤玉米。
    但加土数量也不宜太多，过去有的地方加入90％以上的土，这样不但增加运输量，肥料的质量也会降低。怎样才算适宜呢？一般以一份粪尿加入三至四份细土为宜；土过少吸蓄不住肥分，不能起保肥作用。
    在南方，牛栏中应多垫入切碎的稻草、草皮、干树叶等作褥草，并做到勤出勤垫，能够提高肥料的质量和数量。在盛产草炭的地区，可以将草炭打碎以后垫入牲畜圈中。草炭能吸蓄住肥料中的肥分，是垫圈的良好材料。
    更有效地保存人粪尿，应该从改良厕所入手。把厕所修建完好无缝，使粪尿不会往地里渗漏，同时还能减少人尿中氮素的挥发。在河南、广西等省采用的瓦瓮式茅池，肚大口小，蓄量既多，又能减少挥发，是积肥保肥的好方法。总之，粪缸、粪窖越不通风透气，氮的损失也越小。
    已积好的肥料，不论堆肥、厩肥或草肥、绿肥，在没有施用以前，应选择背阴处堆积，外面盖土糊泥以保持肥分。据试验，堆肥外面盖土放置的，比不盖土放置的（均一个月），能减少18％的氮素损失。实践中也证明，草肥、绿肥等受到雨水的淋洗，效果也小的多。
    烧火后的柴草灰，也是最好的钾肥，如果在贮藏中受风吹雨淋，养分也会受到损失。化学肥料更应妥善贮存在干燥冷凉的房屋中，以免受潮和产生化学变化。
