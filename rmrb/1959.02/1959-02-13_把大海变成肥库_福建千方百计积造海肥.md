Fuzhou, February 12th (By our reporter) – Hundreds of thousands of fishermen and farmers in the coastal areas of Fujian Province are carrying out a massive campaign to accumulate and produce marine fertilizer. Along the winding 2,800-kilometer coastline, people are extracting fertilizer from the ocean's storehouse day and night, regardless of the weather. Tens of thousands of marine fertilizer and indigenous chemical fertilizer processing plants have also sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Lianjiang, Putian, Huian, and Haicheng counties alone have dispatched nearly a thousand boats and over 100,000 people to accumulate marine fertilizer on a large scale, accumulating a total of over 40 million dan of various marine miscellaneous fertilizers in just a few days. Seven counties, including Jinjiang, Nan'an, Pingtan, and Fuqing, have newly built and expanded more than 1,800 marine fertilizer processing plants. These processing plants have successively produced over 36 million jin of potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, and other highly effective indigenous chemical fertilizers in the past month. After launching the campaign to accumulate and produce marine fertilizer, counties such as Zhangpu, Pingtan, and Jinjiang had all completed their originally planned spring fertilizer accumulation targets ahead of schedule by the end of January, laying a good foundation for this year's spring plowing production.

Fujian Province has 23 coastal counties and cities with a long coastline, winding harbors, and dense islands, boasting extremely diverse types of marine fertilizer resources. According to preliminary investigations in Jinjiang and Lianjiang counties, at least over 10 million dan of seaweed, shellfish, and fish waste fertilizer can be collected annually, which is equivalent to the fertilizer effect of over 30 million jin of superphosphate fertilizer. Fishermen and farmers in various areas have historically had the habit of collecting and using marine fertilizer. Many marine fertilizers are not only used for self-consumption but are also transported to inland mountainous areas to support production.

After liberation, the Party and government leading organs at all levels attached great importance to the development of natural fertilizer resources, put forward the slogan of turning the sea into a fertilizer treasure house, established marine fertilizer production command centers, and unified the arrangement of various forces to actively lead fishermen and farmers to carry out the marine fertilizer accumulation and production campaign, achieving great results. Many regions have systematically investigated marine fertilizer resources, formulated marine fertilizer accumulation plans, and widely promoted various marine fertilizer accumulation and production techniques and experiences. Last year, Lianjiang County transferred some cadres to conduct in-depth investigations in coastal areas, basically clarifying the county's marine fertilizer resources and formulating a large-scale marine fertilizer accumulation and production plan. As a result, the current amount of marine fertilizer accumulated and produced in the county has increased five to six times, or even more than ten times, compared to previous years.

Some regions have also adopted methods such as detailed accounting and mass airing of views to carry out ideological education on communist large-scale collaboration among fishermen and farmers, organizing coastal and mountainous areas to collaborate in terms of labor and means of production, thereby greatly increasing the enthusiasm of coastal fishermen for accumulating and producing marine fertilizer in large quantities. They have accumulated and produced a large amount of marine fertilizer to support farmers in mountainous areas in developing production; farmers in mountainous areas have also promptly cut and transported a large amount of moso bamboo, wood, and other means of production to actively support coastal fishermen in developing fisheries. Mountainous areas have also dispatched a large amount of labor to coastal areas during the peak season of marine fertilizer production, thus solving the difficulties of insufficient labor and equipment for fertilizer accumulation in coastal areas. XiaPu county recently transferred 10,000 laborers from the mountainous areas to participate in marine fertilizer accumulation and production along the coast; in one day, they salvaged more than 45,000 dan of laver and other fertilizers.

Since there are many sources of fertilizer for marine fertilizer accumulation and production, and certain collection and production techniques are required, all regions have established specialized marine fertilizer accumulation teams, adopting a combination of year-round fertilizer accumulation and mass shock fertilizer accumulation methods to accumulate and produce marine fertilizer in large quantities. After Lianjiang, Putian, Huian, and other three counties recently launched a large-scale marine fertilizer accumulation campaign with year-round fertilizer accumulation teams as the backbone, leading a fertilizer accumulation army of more than 100,000 people, they produced more than 40 million dan of marine miscellaneous fertilizer in just a few days.

In addition, under the leadership of the Marine Fertilizer Production Command, various regions have established marine fertilizer dispatching and fertilizer price management agencies to uniformly arrange the work of purchasing, processing, manufacturing, and marketing.

In the professional team and mass marine fertilizer accumulation and production movement, the coastal regions not only opened up many new marine fertilizer resources, but also created a wealth of methods and experience in marine fertilizer accumulation and production. Such as using nets to catch stinky fish and rotten shrimp; excavating and accumulating marine mud and marine fine sand; scraping epiphytic fertilizers from sea crabs and shellfish; washing fish and shrimp brine; composting various mixed fertilizers; burning shell ash; breeding shellfish and other marine fertilizers; accumulating various bone and thorn waste materials; processing and manufacturing various indigenous chemical fertilizers, etc. At present, while fishermen and farmers in coastal areas are using the above-mentioned methods to accumulate and produce marine fertilizer in large quantities, they have also established various marine fertilizer processing plants, fertilizer plants, etc., to develop from crude fertilizer to fine fertilizer and from low-efficiency fertilizer to high-efficiency fertilizer, determined to make the ocean provide agriculture with more and better fertilizers.

    把大海变成肥库
    福建千方百计积造海肥
    本报福州12日电　福建省沿海几十万渔民和农民开展了一个声势浩大的积海肥制海肥运动。在蜿蜒两千八百多公里的海岸线上，人们不分晴雨和昼夜，向海洋肥库索取肥料。成千上万个造海肥和土化肥的加工厂，也如雨后春笋般建立起来。连江、莆田、惠安和海澄等四个县出动近千条船、十万多人大积海肥，在几天中共计已积各种海杂肥料四千多万担。晋江、南安、平潭、福清等七个县新建和扩建了一千八百多个海肥加工厂。这些加工厂在近一个月中先后制造了氯化钾、氯化镁和其他肥效很高的土化肥三千六百多万斤。漳浦、平潭和晋江等县在开展积海肥、制海肥运动以后，到1月底止，都已提前超额完成了原订的春季积肥计划，为今年春耕生产打下了良好的基础。
    福建省沿海有二十三个县市，海岸线漫长，港湾曲折，海岛密布，海肥资源品种极多。据晋江、连江两县初步调查，每年至少可以采集海藻、贝壳和鱼杂肥一千多万担以上，这相当于三千万斤以上的肥田粉的肥效。各地渔民和农民历来就有采集和使用海肥的习惯，有许多海肥除了自用外，还运销到内陆山区各地支援生产。
    解放后，各地党政领导机关十分重视开发天然肥料资源，提出把大海变成肥料宝库的口号，成立海肥生产指挥部，统一安排各方面力量，积极领导渔民、农民开展积海肥、制海肥运动，并且取得了很大的成绩。许多地区有计划地调查海肥资源，制订积海肥规划，广泛推广各种积制海肥的技术和经验。连江县在去年抽调了一些干部深入沿海地区进行调查，基本摸清了全县海肥资源情况，订出了大规模积制海肥规划。因此，全县现有积制海肥数量，已比往年跃增五、六倍到十多倍。
    还有些地区采用算细账、大鸣大放等方法，在渔民和农民中开展共产主义大协作的思想教育，组织沿海和山区在劳力和生产资料方面进行协作，从而大大提高了沿海渔民大量积制海肥的积极性。他们积制了大量海肥，支援山区农民发展生产；山区农民也及时砍运了大量毛竹、木材等生产资料积极支援沿海渔民发展渔业。山区还在海肥盛产季节抽派大量劳力到沿海地区积制海肥，因而解决了沿海地区积肥劳力和器材不足的困难。霞浦县最近从山区抽调了一万个劳力到沿海参加积制海肥，他们一天中就打捞海苔等肥料四万五千多担。
    由于积制海肥的肥源很多，又需具有一定的采制技术，因此各地都建立了积海肥专业队，采用常年积肥和群众性突击积肥相结合的方法，大量积制海肥。连江、莆田、惠安等三个县在最近以常年积肥队为骨干带领了十多万积肥大军大积海肥后，仅几天就制造海杂肥四千多万担。
    此外，各地区还在海肥生产指挥部领导下建立了海肥调度、肥价管理机构，统一安排收购、加工制造和运销等工作。
    沿海各地在开展专业队和群众性大积、大造海肥运动中，不但开辟了许多新的海肥资源，还创造了丰富的积制海肥的方法和经验。如用网具捕捞臭鱼烂虾；挖积海泥、海细砂；刮取海蟹和贝壳类附生肥料；洗鱼虾卤汁；沤制各种混合肥；烧制壳灰；养殖贝壳类等海肥肥料；积储各种骨刺废料；加工制造各种土化肥等。现在沿海各地渔民和农民在采用上述各种方法大量积制海肥同时，并举办了各种海肥加工厂、化肥厂等，向变粗肥为细肥、变低效肥为高效肥的方向发展，决心要叫海洋为农业提供更多更好的肥料。（附图片）
