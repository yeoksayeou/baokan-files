An increased accumulation of fertilizer is to ensure high yields of grain, cotton, and other crops. If one only focuses on the quantity of fertilizer accumulated without paying attention to its quality, the goal of high yields will not be achieved. The Jiaohe County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party took a positive measure by conducting a universal inspection of fertilizer quality during the vigorous fertilizer accumulation campaign. If those things that cannot act as fertilizer or have extremely minimal fertilizing effect are also put into the fields, it will not only waste a lot of manpower in accumulating and transporting fertilizer, but also fail to meet the needs of crop growth, inevitably affecting yield.

To have a pragmatic spirit in work is something the masses support. After Jiaohe County removed some sod that could not be used as fertilizer from the total amount of fertilizer accumulated and guided the masses' enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer onto the correct path, the masses' enthusiasm became even higher. Moreover, they found abundant sources of high-efficiency fertilizer, pushing the fertilizer accumulation campaign to a new high tide.

    一项积极的措施
    多积肥，是为了确保粮棉等作物高产。如果只着重积肥数量而不注意质量，就达不到高产的目的。中共蛟河县委在大搞积肥运动中，对肥料质量进行一次普遍检查，无疑是一个积极的措施。假若把那些不能起到肥料作用或肥效极其微小的东西，也上到地里去，不仅浪费许多积肥运肥的人力，而且不能满足作物生长的需要，势必影响产量。
    干工作要有求实精神，这一点群众是拥护的。蛟河县把一些不能当作肥料的草皮土从积肥的总数中剔出去，把群众的积肥积极性引导到正确的道路上来以后，群众的积极性更高了，而且找到了储量丰富的高效肥源，把积肥运动推向了新的高潮。
