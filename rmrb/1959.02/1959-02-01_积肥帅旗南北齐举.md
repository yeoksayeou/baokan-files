Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, January 31st: "As the commune's morning bell rings, fertilizer accumulation carts set out, countless peaks arise on the vast North Anhui Plain." This folk song reflects the vigorous mass fertilizer accumulation campaign unfolding in Anhui Province. Current statistics show that over four million people across the province have joined the fertilizer accumulation movement, collecting over 71 billion dan of various natural fertilizers, a fivefold increase compared to the same period last year. Additionally, over 19 million dan of native chemical fertilizers have been produced.

Through unified labor allocation, Anhui Province's fertilizer accumulation front has been greatly strengthened. In the Huaibei region of Bengbu Prefecture, eight counties have organized over 10,000 specialized fertilizer accumulation teams, with 290,000 people participating. Funan County, which previously had only 50,000 people involved in fertilizer accumulation, has increased that number to over 100,000 after labor allocation. In Tongcheng County, the number of participants has increased from over 20,000 to over 40,000.

Various localities in Anhui have adopted diverse methods based on their local conditions to expand fertilizer sources. In Wuhu Prefecture, counties such as Xiuning, Nanling, Fanchang, Jingxian, and Taiping have adopted a "five-combination" approach: first, combining water conservancy projects, fishing, and lotus root digging to vigorously dig pond mud; second, combining rice borer and snail control with digging rice roots and turf to burn a large amount of soil fertilizer; third, combining general cleaning to collect garbage, ditch mud, and house foundation soil; fourth, combining winter livestock protection by replacing soil and filling with straw to accumulate stable manure; fifth, combining seedling nurturing by removing weeds, accumulating fertilized soil, burning soil fertilizer, and making compost. These methods have greatly accelerated the fertilizer accumulation movement and yielded significant results. In Fuyang Prefecture, under the slogan "Search for fertilizer sources in all directions, mobilize thousands of troops for mass fertilizer accumulation," efforts are focused on field fumigation, burning fertilizer, shoveling and exchanging household soil and stove soil, digging and dredging pond mud, and producing high-temperature compost, along with collecting garbage through general cleaning. Currently, the entire prefecture has accumulated over 26 billion dan of fertilizer.

The Anhui Provincial Party Committee recently made new arrangements for the current fertilizer accumulation work. Various localities are implementing the provincial committee's instructions, reallocating labor, and setting new fertilizer accumulation tasks, requiring all sectors, whether rural or urban, people's communes or government offices, schools, and military units, to assign fertilizer accumulation tasks, ensuring that everyone participates and everyone accumulates fertilizer.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 31st: In the hilly, mountainous, plain, and lakefront areas of Hubei Province, people are actively involved in accumulating and producing fertilizer, striving to accumulate 30 billion dan of fertilizer and produce 10 billion jin of native chemical fertilizer by the end of March.

Party committees at all levels in Hubei Province have specifically deployed forces, led by secretaries, to strengthen leadership over the fertilizer accumulation and production campaign. In counties such as Jianli and Hanchuan, located in the Jianghan Plain, fertilizer accumulation command organizations have been established at all levels from the county and commune to the management area under the leadership of party organizations. Many localities have also divided war zones by management area based on the characteristics of different regions, adopting the method of "mobilizing tens of thousands of people and advancing on land and water" to carry out red flag competitions. Party secretaries at all levels taking command mobilized the masses to summarize the experience of increased fertilization and high yields of various crops last year, calculated the comparison between this year's large production plan and the increased need for fertilizer compared to last year, formulated fertilizer accumulation and production plans, and quickly organized commune members to join the movement. They also personally went to the front lines to prepare "food" for the crops together with the masses, further boosting the enthusiasm of the broad masses and rapidly forming a high tide of the fertilizer accumulation movement throughout the province.

While vigorously promoting farm manure, many native chemical fertilizer plants have been established in various localities, producing a large amount of native chemical fertilizer. In Jingzhou Prefecture alone, more than 15,000 new native chemical fertilizer plants have been established. Junxian County, based on the characteristics of abundant organic matter such as leaves, wild grass, and animal manure in the mountainous areas, has recently built more than 4,000 new factories for producing native chemical fertilizer, bacterial fertilizer, and granular fertilizer in just over half a month, producing more than 110 million jin of various fertilizers. Various localities also pay great attention to the basic construction of fertilizer accumulation. People's communes in Jingzhou Prefecture have newly dug more than 500,000 field ponds and manure cellars.

Government offices, military units, schools, and urban residents throughout the province have successively sent fertilizer to the countryside. According to incomplete statistics from six counties, Sui, Guanghua, and Zaoyang, in Xiangyang Prefecture, tens of thousands of people send manure to the countryside every day. More than 12,000 people from Chengguan Town in Guanghua County participated in sending fertilizer, having already sent 450,000 dan of fertilizer.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 31st: The Fujian Provincial Party Committee held a broadcast rally on the evening of the 29th to promote mass fertilizer accumulation and strive for a bumper summer harvest. More than 3.5 million listeners across the province immediately made phone calls and sent telegrams to the provincial committee to guarantee the successful completion of this year's agricultural production increase tasks.

Currently, Fujian Province has a labor force of 3 million people fighting on the fertilizer accumulation front. In January, more than 2.8 billion dan of fertilizer were accumulated, averaging about 100 million dan per day. With the spring plowing season approaching, the provincial committee requires the entire party and all the people to be urgently mobilized, boost revolutionary spirit, and further launch a larger-scale preparatory farming upsurge centered on fertilizer accumulation and production.

At the meeting, eighteen labor models presented eight initiatives for doing a good job in fertilizer accumulation and preparatory farming to strive for a bumper summer harvest. Four hundred telegrams and phone calls arrived from all over the province, and dozens of good news reporting teams were sent to the venue to guarantee the provincial committee that they would not withdraw until they had won a complete victory in fertilizer accumulation and a bumper summer harvest. More than fifty cadres, fertilizer accumulation models, and activists from Xindian People's Commune in the suburbs of Fuzhou City, led by the party committee secretary, carried a letter of determination and reported good news to the meeting with gongs and drums: all commune members, working hard and cleverly, accumulated more than 150,000 dan of soil fertilizer in one day on the 29th, exceeding the usual daily progress by two times. The 100,000 fertilizer accumulation troops in Fuan County put forward the slogan of "Seizing every second,搶every dan of fertilizer", determined to work hard and cleverly for ten days, accumulating more than 10 million dan of fertilizer. The People's Liberation Army on the coastal defense front, employees of various factories and enterprises, staff of government offices, and teachers and students of various schools all expressed their willingness to contribute their efforts and make contributions to the bumper summer harvest. Provincial-level government cadres, who have been actively involved in fertilizer accumulation in recent days, became even more enthusiastic after hearing the broadcast. The Provincial People's Court and the Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, which have overfulfilled the task of accumulating 200 dan of fertilizer per person, are determined to double the amount of fertilizer again and ensure quality and delivery. Staff of the Provincial Department of Commerce guaranteed to assist communes in running native chemical fertilizer plants on a large scale, striving to produce 1.5 million tons of native chemical fertilizer before the spring plowing. Many counties and communes immediately launched challenges and responses to compare enthusiasm, measures, and production management. Now, a national fertilizer accumulation movement with everyone participating has spread throughout the province.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, January 28th: More than 1.3 million farmers of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region responded to the call of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China at the broadcast rally held on the 26th and launched into a fertilizer accumulation campaign to strive for a great leap forward in agricultural production this year.

From both sides of the Xiliao River to the vast rural areas of the Yellow River irrigation area in the autonomous region, 840,000 people have been mobilized to carry out a fertilizer accumulation, production and delivery campaign. As of mid-January, farmers of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region had accumulated more than 700 billion jin of fertilizer, of which 76 billion jin had been delivered to the fields. This year, due to the people's communes adopting a method of combining the organization of professional fertilizer accumulation teams with the mass movement for fertilizer accumulation, the amount of fertilizer accumulation has increased rapidly compared to previous years. The second work area of the Dengta People's Commune in Chifeng City, Zhaowuda League, has accumulated 158 million jin of fertilizer using this method, with an average of more than 26,000 jin of fertilizer applied per mu, an increase of four and a half times compared to last year.

The people's communes in the autonomous region have opened up a large number of fertilizer sources by adapting to local conditions. People's communes in Zhuozi County, Ulanqab League, have recently successfully trial-produced various native chemical fertilizers using wild plants and phosphate rock and other natural resources. The newly built 214 native chemical fertilizer plants are producing fertilizer day and night. At present, farmers in the autonomous region have newly built 12,382 native chemical fertilizer and bacterial fertilizer plants, producing 595 million jin of native chemical fertilizer and bacterial fertilizer, with an average of 119 jin of fertilizer applied per mu.

In order to accumulate more fertilizer and save time to deliver the fertilizer to the fields, various localities in the autonomous region have vigorously reformed fertilizer accumulation and manure delivery tools. Members of all ethnic groups, cadres, and students in the suburbs of Hohhot City worked together for about ten days to manufacture more than 8,000 fertilizer transportation vehicles, basically realizing the mechanization of fertilizer transportation, greatly accelerating the progress of manure delivery. Twelve communes in Kailu County, Tongliao City, and Aohan Banner have recently built an approximately 150-kilometer-long ice road transportation line and manufactured more than 1,000 sleds (ice sleds) to carry out rapid manure delivery.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 28th: In Heilongjiang Province, which has a cold climate and vast territory, the number of people participating in fertilizer accumulation in rural areas has increased to nearly one million, accounting for about one-quarter of the rural male and female labor force. Currently, more than 1.37 trillion jin of various fertilizers have been accumulated, an increase of more than three times compared to the same period last year. According to the province's preliminary planned planting area for this year, the average fertilizer application per mu can reach more than 16,000 jin, an increase of more than four times compared to the average of 3,000 jin per mu last year.

Based on the characteristics of the large amount of fertilizer accumulation this year, various localities in the province have vigorously mobilized the masses to reform transportation tools to ensure that all the fertilizer is delivered to the fields before spring plowing. Chaoyang People's Commune in Shuangcheng County calculated that if they did not reform the tools, it would take 45 days to deliver all the fertilizer to the fields. Later, they mobilized the masses to take advantage of the winter ice and snow conditions to implement ice road sledding for manure transportation and sled trains, so that all the fertilizer could be delivered to the fields before spring plowing. At present, this commune has poured out 80 large and small ice roads, forming a network of ice roads extending from the manure piles to the fields throughout the commune.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 31st: On January 28th, Shanghai County, with soaring enthusiasm, proposed an agricultural production increase competition to the ten counties in the suburbs of Shanghai, with fertilizer accumulation as the primary condition. This proposal received a warm response from various counties, pushing the fertilizer accumulation movement in the rural areas of the suburbs to a new climax. At present, 400,000 people in various counties have invested in the fertilizer accumulation movement, accumulating 50 million dan of fertilizer every day.

After the New Year, a vigorous fertilizer accumulation movement was launched in the rural areas of eleven counties in the suburbs of Shanghai. The broad masses and cadres braved the severe cold, digging, smoking, composting, fishing, and shoveling, and launched a struggle to extract fertilizer from nature. From January 1st to 29th, 829 million dan of fertilizer have been accumulated in the suburbs of the city.

The characteristic of this fertilizer accumulation movement is that it takes fertilizer accumulation as the leader, driving other tasks, and achieving the effect of "one shot, multiple hits." Songjiang County adopted six combined measures: water conservancy construction and large-scale river mud digging, field management and green manure cultivation, livestock development and stable manure accumulation, general cleaning and pit composting, urban waste management and increased accumulation of human excrement and urine, pest and snail control and accumulation of weed fertilizer and mud fertilizer, which greatly increased the amount of fertilizer accumulation and expanded the fertilizer source, and promoted other tasks. More than 90% of the county's 440,000 mu of green manure crops have become first-class seedlings after strengthening management and cultivation. After Jinshan County adopted this method of driving other tasks with fertilizer accumulation, it accumulated 7.32 million dan of various mud and miscellaneous fertilizers and produced 491,500 jin of native chemical fertilizer in just four days, and completed the work of breaking soil and cultivating soil in all green manure fields.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, January 31st: Whether in the evergreen heartland, the snowy and cold mountainous areas, or the subtropical southern regions of Yunnan Province, a climax has been universally formed in the fertilizer accumulation and production movement. A total of one million people of all ethnic groups across the province are participating in fertilizer accumulation. According to recent statistics, more than 350 billion jin of various fertilizers have been accumulated in the province, an increase of eight times compared to the same period last year. Among them, human and animal manure, native chemical fertilizer, and other high-quality fertilizers account for more than half, which is four times more than all the fertilizers in the same period last year.

In the Zhaotong Prefecture in the Jinsha River Basin, more than 200,000 fertilizer accumulation teams are accumulating fertilizer in the high mountains, singing: "The moon is not bright in the cold winter, wind and snow cannot stop ambitious people, live in the mountains and fight hard to accumulate fertilizer, mountain songs shake the mountains." They shoveled through more than a foot deep of accumulated snow, shoveled out fallen leaves and mountain grass from the forest, and are determined to cut off all the mountain grass and win the red flag before going down the mountain. In the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture on the shores of Erhai Lake, people of all ethnic groups adopted methods such as searching on the mountains, cutting on the plains, sweeping at home, picking outside, fishing in the sea, digging in the ditches, filling in the stables, and manufacturing in factories to accumulate and produce fertilizer on a large scale. They decided to fight hard for a month to achieve 30,000 jin of fertilizer per mu by the end of February and accumulate all the fertilizer needed for the spring before transplanting seedlings. In the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in the Lancang River Basin, after a national fertilizer accumulation blitz week, 27.5 billion jin of fertilizer have been accumulated, an increase of nine times compared to the same period last year. The Lisu people in Bijiang, Lushui, Gongshan, and Fugong counties in the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture have completely changed the habit of people without toilets and animals without padded stables this year, building 1,000 large toilets and large animal stables each, and further launched a national fertilizer accumulation climax under the slogan of "Asking for fertilizer from Biluo Snow Mountain and Gaoligong Mountain" to ensure that 100,000 jin of fertilizer are applied per mu in the spring.

In the national fertilizer accumulation movement, urban people have also taken action. Cadres of government offices, factory workers, students, and military units in various towns in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture decided to donate 5,000 jin of fertilizer per person before the Spring Festival.

    积肥帅旗南北齐举
    安徽：千里淮北平原飞来无数肥峰
    据新华社合肥31日电　“公社响起晨钟，积肥车马出动，千里淮北平原，飞来无数山峰”这首民歌反映出了安徽省群众性的积肥运动正在蓬勃展开。到目前统计，全省投入积肥运动的已达四百多万人，攒积的各种自然肥料已达七百一十多亿担，比去年同期增加五倍以上。另外，还生产了土化肥一千九百多万担。
    通过统一安排劳动力，安徽省积肥战线大大加强。蚌埠专区淮北八个县就组织了一万多个积肥专业队，参加积肥专业队的有二十九万人。阜南县原来参加积肥的只有五万多人，经过安排劳动力以后，增加到了十万多人。枞阳县参加积肥的人数也由二万多人增加到四万多人。
    安徽各地都根据本地特点，采取了多种多样的办法开辟肥源。芜湖专区的休宁、南陵、繁昌、泾县、太平等县采取了五结合的办法：一，结合兴修水利、捕鱼、挖藕，大力挖塘泥；二，结合治螟、灭螺、挖稻根、铲草皮，大烧土粪；三，结合大扫除，大搞垃圾、阴沟泥、屋基土；四，结合冬季保畜，换新土，填稻草，积造厩肥；五，结合幼苗抚育，铲杂草，积肥土，烧土粪，制堆肥。这些办法使积肥运动大大加快，收效很大。阜阳专区在“四面八方找肥源，千军万马大积肥”的口号下，大搞田头熏肥、烧肥、铲换家土、灶土、挖捞塘泥、制造高温堆肥，并结合大扫除聚积垃圾，现在全专区已经积肥二百六十多亿担。
    中共安徽省委最近对当前积肥工作又作了新的部署。各地正在贯彻省委指示，重新安排劳动力，提出新的积肥任务，要求不论是农村或城镇，不论是人民公社或机关、学校、部队，都规定积肥任务，做到人人动手，个个积肥。
　　湖北：万人飞马上阵水陆积肥并进
    据新华社武汉31日电　湖北省丘陵、山区、平原和滨湖地区到处活跃着积肥造肥的人们，他们力争到3月底以前积肥三百亿担，造土化肥一百亿斤。
    湖北省各地党委都专门部署力量，由书记挂帅加强对积肥造肥运动的领导。地处江汉平原的监利、汉川等县，从县、公社到管理区，都在党组织领导下建立了积肥指挥机构。许多地方还根据不同地区特点，以管理区为单位划分战区，采取“万人上阵、水陆并进”的方法，开展红旗竞赛。出马挂帅的各级党委书记，发动群众总结去年各种庄稼施肥多、增产大的经验，算今年生产规划大、需要肥料比去年多的对比账，制定出积肥造肥规划，很快地组织社员投入这一运动，并且亲自上前线与群众一道为庄稼备“粮”，更加鼓舞了广大群众的干劲，使积肥运动迅速地在全省范围内形成高潮。
    在大搞农家肥料的同时，各地还办起许多土化肥厂，制造了大量土化肥。仅荆州专区新办土化肥厂就达一万五千多个。均县根据山区树叶、野草和兽粪等有机物多的特点，最近半个多月中新建制造土化肥、细菌肥和颗粒肥等工厂四千多个，生产了各种肥料一亿一千多万斤。各地也很注意积肥的基本建设。荆州专区各人民公社新挖的田头垱、大粪窑就有五十多万个。
    全省各地机关、部队、学校和城镇居民纷纷送肥下乡。据襄阳专区的随县、光化、枣阳等六个县的不完全统计，每天都有数万人送粪下乡。光化县城关镇参加送肥的有一万二千多人，已送肥四十五万担。
　　福建：四面八方响应誓争积肥全胜
    新华社福州31日电　中共福建省委29日晚上举行了大搞积肥争取夏季大丰收的广播大会。全省三百五十多万听众当场就纷纷打电话和打电报向省委保证胜利完成今年农业增产任务。
    福建省目前有三百万劳动大军奋战在积肥战线上，1月份已积肥二十八亿多担，平均日进一亿担左右。现在春耕季节日益迫近，省委要求全党全民要紧急动员起来，鼓足冲天的革命干劲，进一步掀起规模更大的以积肥造肥为中心的备耕高潮。
    在大会上，有十八个劳动模范，当场提出了搞好积肥、备耕、争取夏季大丰收的八项倡议。全省各地来了四百件电报、电话，并派来几十支报喜队来到会场，向省委保证，不夺得积肥全胜、不夺得夏季大丰收，决不收兵。福州市郊新店人民公社五十多个干部、积肥模范、积极分子，在党委书记带领下，抬着决心书，敲锣打鼓地向大会报喜：全社社员，苦干巧干，在29日一天中，积土肥十五万多担，超过往常日积进度两倍。福安县十万积肥人马，提出“分秒必争、担肥必抢”的口号，决定苦战巧战十天，积肥上千万担。海防前线的解放军、各工厂企业的职工、机关工作人员和各学校师生，都表示要贡献自己力量，为夏季大丰收立功。连日来积极投入积肥的省级机关干部，听到广播后斗志更加昂扬，已超额完成每人积肥二百担任务的省人民法院、省邮电管理局，决心将积肥数量再翻一番，并保质、保送。省商业厅工作人员保证协助公社大办土化肥厂，力争在春耕前生产土化肥一百五十万吨。当场许多县和公社开展了比干劲、比措施、比生产管理的挑战和应战。现在，一个人人动手的全民积肥运动已普及全省。
    内蒙古：大改工具快速积肥送粪
    据新华社呼和浩特28日电　内蒙古自治区一百三十多万各族农民响应中共内蒙古自治区委员会在26日召开广播大会的号召，浩浩荡荡地投入积肥运动，力争今年在农业生产上来个大跃进。
    从自治区西辽河两岸到黄河河套灌区的广大农村，目前已经出动八十四万人，大搞积肥、造肥和送肥的突击运动。截至1月中旬，自治区各族农民已积下七千多亿斤肥料，其中送到地里的有七百六十亿斤。今年，由于人民公社采取组织专业积肥队和大搞群众运动积肥相结合的办法，积肥量比往年增加的很快。昭乌达盟赤峰市灯塔人民公社第二作业区，用这一办法已经积肥一亿五千八百多万斤，每亩平均能施肥二万六千多斤，比去年增加四倍半。
    自治区各人民公社因地制宜地开辟出大量肥源。乌兰察布盟卓资县各人民公社，最近利用野生植物和磷矿石等天然资源，综合试制成功各种土化肥。新建的二百一十四座土化肥厂，日夜造肥。目前，全自治区的农民新建的土化肥、菌肥厂达一万二千三百八十二个，已生产出五亿九千五百多万斤土化肥、菌肥，平均每亩可施肥一百一十九斤。
    为了多积肥并争取时间把肥料送到田间，自治区各地大力改革积肥、送粪工具。呼和浩特市郊区各民族男女社员、干部、学生等一齐动手，奋战十天左右，制成八千多辆运肥车，基本上实现了运肥车子化，大大加快了送粪进度。开鲁县、通辽市、敖汉旗等地十二个公社，最近筑成长约一百五十公里的冰道运输线，并自制一千多台爬犁（冰上滑车），展开快速送粪。黑龙江：破冰踏雪及时积肥送肥上地
    新华社哈尔滨28日电　在气候寒冷、地区辽阔的黑龙江省，农村参加积肥的人数已增加到近百万人，占农村男女劳动力的四分之一左右。目前已积各种粪肥一万三千七百多亿斤，比去年同时期积肥数量增加三倍多。按全省今年初步计划播种面积计算，平均每亩施肥量可达一万六千多斤，比去年平均每亩施三千斤增加了四倍多。
    全省各地根据今年积肥数量大的特点，大力发动群众改革运输工具，保证在春耕前把粪肥全部送到地里。双城县朝阳人民公社计算了一下，如果不改革工具，要四十五天才能把全部粪肥送到地里，后来发动群众，利用冬季冰雪的条件，实行运粪冰道爬犁化，爬犁列车化，这样在春耕前就可以全部把粪肥送到地里。目前这个公社已浇出大小冰道八十条，形成全社从粪堆到田间四通八达的冰道网。
    上海：积肥一马当先　农活全面跟上
    据新华社上海31日电　上海县在1月28日，以冲天的干劲，向上海市郊十个县提出以积肥为首要条件的农业增产竞赛倡议。这个倡议，得到了各县的热烈响应，把郊区农村的积肥运动推上了一个新的高潮。目前，各县已有四十万人投入积肥运动，每天积肥达五千万担。
    新年过后，一个声势浩大的积肥运动即在上海市郊十一个县农村中蓬勃展开。广大群众和干部冒着严寒，挖、熏、沤、捞、铲，展开了向大自然索取肥料的斗争。从1月1日到29日止，全市郊区已积肥八亿二千九百万担。
    这次积肥运动的特点是，以积肥挂帅，带动其它各项工作，收到“一炮数响”之效。松江县采取了兴修水利和大搞河泥、田间管理和培育绿肥、发展畜牧业和积厩肥、卫生大扫除和挖坑堆肥、城镇粪便管理和增积人粪尿、治虫灭螺和积杂草肥泥肥等六结合措施，既大大增加了积肥量扩大了肥源，又推进了其他各项工作。全县四十四万亩绿肥田作物，经过加强管理培育，90％以上都成了一类苗。金山县采取这种以积肥带动其他工作的办法后，仅在四天内就积到各种泥杂肥料七百三十二万担，制造土化肥四十九万一千五百斤，全部绿肥田完成了碎泥培土的培育工作。
    云南：各族百万人民奋战平原山林
    据新华社昆明31日电　云南省不论是四季如春的腹心地区，大雪纷飞的高寒山区，或是亚热带的南部地区，积肥造肥运动普遍形成高潮，全省参加积肥的共有一百万各族人民。据最近统计，全省已积得各种肥料三千五百多亿斤，比去年同期增加了八倍。其中人畜粪、土化肥和其他优质肥料占一半以上，比去年同期全部肥料还多四倍。
    金沙江流域的昭通专区，有二十多万积肥队伍在高山上积肥，他们唱着：“数九寒天月不明，风雪难挡雄心人，住山苦战积肥料，山歌调子震山林。”他们扒开一尺多深的积雪，铲出森林里的落叶和山草，决心将山草割光夺得红旗才下山。洱海之滨的大理白族自治州，各族人民采用山上找、平地割、家里扫、外面拣、海里捞、沟里挖、厩里垫、工厂造等办法，大积大造肥料，他们决定苦战一月，到2月底实现每亩有肥三万斤，在栽秧前全部积够大春用肥。澜沧江流域的西双版纳傣族自治州，经过全民性的积肥突击周，已积肥二百七十五亿斤，比去年同期增加九倍。怒江傈僳族自治州碧江、泸水、贡山、福贡等四县傈僳族人民，今年彻底改变人无厕所，畜无垫厩的习惯，修盖起大厕所、大畜厩各一千个，并且在“向碧罗雪山和高黎贡山要肥”的口号下进一步掀起全民积肥高潮，保证大春每亩施肥十万斤。
    在全民积肥运动中，城市人民也行动起来了。大理白族自治州各城镇机关干部、厂矿职工、学生、部队决定春节前每人献肥五千斤。（附图片）
