Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, January 31st: "As the commune's morning bell rings, fertilizer accumulation carts set out, countless peaks arise on the vast North Anhui Plain." This folk song reflects the vigorous mass fertilizer accumulation campaign unfolding in Anhui Province. Current statistics show that over four million people across the province have joined the fertilizer accumulation movement, collecting over 71 billion dan of various natural fertilizers, a fivefold increase compared to the same period last year. Additionally, over 19 million dan of native chemical fertilizers have been produced.

Through unified labor allocation, Anhui Province's fertilizer accumulation front has been greatly strengthened. In the Huaibei region of Bengbu Prefecture, eight counties have organized over 10,000 specialized fertilizer accumulation teams, with 290,000 people participating. Funan County, which previously had only 50,000 people involved in fertilizer accumulation, has increased that number to over 100,000 after labor allocation. In Tongcheng County, the number of participants has increased from over 20,000 to over 40,000.

Various localities in Anhui have adopted diverse methods based on their local conditions to expand fertilizer sources. In Wuhu Prefecture, counties such as Xiuning, Nanling, Fanchang, Jingxian, and Taiping have adopted a "five-combination" approach: first, combining water conservancy projects, fishing, and lotus root digging to vigorously dig pond mud; second, combining rice borer and snail control with digging rice roots and turf to burn a large amount of soil fertilizer; third, combining general cleaning to collect garbage, ditch mud, and house foundation soil; fourth, combining winter livestock protection by replacing soil and filling with straw to accumulate stable manure; fifth, combining seedling nurturing by removing weeds, accumulating fertilized soil, burning soil fertilizer, and making compost. These methods have greatly accelerated the fertilizer accumulation movement and yielded significant results. In Fuyang Prefecture, under the slogan "Search for fertilizer sources in all directions, mobilize thousands of troops for mass fertilizer accumulation," efforts are focused on field fumigation, burning fertilizer, shoveling and exchanging household soil and stove soil, digging and dredging pond mud, and producing high-temperature compost, along with collecting garbage through general cleaning. Currently, the entire prefecture has accumulated over 26 billion dan of fertilizer.

The Anhui Provincial Party Committee recently made new arrangements for the current fertilizer accumulation work. Various localities are implementing the provincial committee's instructions, reallocating labor, and setting new fertilizer accumulation tasks, requiring all sectors, whether rural or urban, people's communes or government offices, schools, and military units, to assign fertilizer accumulation tasks, ensuring that everyone participates and everyone accumulates fertilizer.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 31st: In the hilly, mountainous, plain, and lakefront areas of Hubei Province, people are actively involved in accumulating and producing fertilizer, striving to accumulate 30 billion dan of fertilizer and produce 10 billion jin of native chemical fertilizer by the end of March.

Party committees at all levels in Hubei Province have specifically deployed forces, led by secretaries, to strengthen leadership over the fertilizer accumulation and production campaign. In counties such as Jianli and Hanchuan, located in the Jianghan Plain, fertilizer accumulation command organizations have been established at all levels from the county and commune to the management area under the leadership of party organizations. Many localities have also divided war zones by management area based on the characteristics of different regions, adopting the method of "mobilizing tens of thousands of people and advancing on land and water" to carry out red flag competitions. Party secretaries at all levels taking command mobilized the masses to summarize the experience of increased fertilization and high yields of various crops last year, calculated the comparison between this year's large production plan and the increased need for fertilizer compared to last year, formulated fertilizer accumulation and production plans, and quickly organized commune members to join the movement. They also personally went to the front lines to prepare "food" for the crops together with the masses, further boosting the enthusiasm of the broad masses and rapidly forming a high tide of the fertilizer accumulation movement throughout the province.

While vigorously promoting farm manure, many native chemical fertilizer plants have been established in various localities, producing a large amount of native chemical fertilizer. In Jingzhou Prefecture alone, more than 15,000 new native chemical fertilizer plants have been established. Junxian County, based on the characteristics of abundant organic matter such as leaves, wild grass, and animal manure in the mountainous areas, has recently built more than 4,000 new factories for producing native chemical fertilizer, bacterial fertilizer, and granular fertilizer in just over half a month, producing more than 110 million jin of various fertilizers. Various localities also pay great attention to the basic construction of fertilizer accumulation. People's communes in Jingzhou Prefecture have newly dug more than 500,000 field ponds and manure cellars.

Government offices, military units, schools, and urban residents throughout the province have successively sent fertilizer to the countryside. According to incomplete statistics from six counties, Sui, Guanghua, and Zaoyang, in Xiangyang Prefecture, tens of thousands of people send manure to the countryside every day. More than 12,000 people from Chengguan Town in Guanghua County participated in sending fertilizer, having already sent 450,000 dan of fertilizer.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 31st: The Fujian Provincial Party Committee held a broadcast rally on the evening of the 29th to promote mass fertilizer accumulation and strive for a bumper summer harvest. More than 3.5 million listeners across the province immediately made phone calls and sent telegrams to the provincial committee to guarantee the successful completion of this year's agricultural production increase tasks.

Currently, Fujian Province has a labor force of 3 million people fighting on the fertilizer accumulation front. In January, more than 2.8 billion dan of fertilizer were accumulated, averaging about 100 million dan per day. With the spring plowing season approaching, the provincial committee requires the entire party and all the people to be urgently mobilized, boost revolutionary spirit, and further launch a larger-scale preparatory farming upsurge centered on fertilizer accumulation and production.

At the meeting, eighteen labor models presented eight initiatives for doing a good job in fertilizer accumulation and preparatory farming to strive for a bumper summer harvest. Four hundred telegrams and phone calls arrived from all over the province, and dozens of good news reporting teams were sent to the venue to guarantee the provincial committee that they would not withdraw until they had won a complete victory in fertilizer accumulation and a bumper summer harvest. More than fifty cadres, fertilizer accumulation models, and activists from Xindian People's Commune in the suburbs of Fuzhou City, led by the party committee secretary, carried a letter of determination and reported good news to the meeting with gongs and drums: all commune members, working hard and cleverly, accumulated more than 150,000 dan of soil fertilizer in one day on the 29th, exceeding the usual daily progress by two times. The 100,000 fertilizer accumulation troops in Fuan County put forward the slogan of "Seizing every second,Êê∂every dan of fertilizer", determined to work hard and cleverly for ten days, accumulating more than 10 million dan of fertilizer. The People's Liberation Army on the coastal defense front, employees of various factories and enterprises, staff of government offices, and teachers and students of various schools all expressed their willingness to contribute their efforts and make contributions to the bumper summer harvest. Provincial-level government cadres, who have been actively involved in fertilizer accumulation in recent days, became even more enthusiastic after hearing the broadcast. The Provincial People's Court and the Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, which have overfulfilled the task of accumulating 200 dan of fertilizer per person, are determined to double the amount of fertilizer again and ensure quality and delivery. Staff of the Provincial Department of Commerce guaranteed to assist communes in running native chemical fertilizer plants on a large scale, striving to produce 1.5 million tons of native chemical fertilizer before the spring plowing. Many counties and communes immediately launched challenges and responses to compare enthusiasm, measures, and production management. Now, a national fertilizer accumulation movement with everyone participating has spread throughout the province.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, January 28th: More than 1.3 million farmers of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region responded to the call of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China at the broadcast rally held on the 26th and launched into a fertilizer accumulation campaign to strive for a great leap forward in agricultural production this year.

From both sides of the Xiliao River to the vast rural areas of the Yellow River irrigation area in the autonomous region, 840,000 people have been mobilized to carry out a fertilizer accumulation, production and delivery campaign. As of mid-January, farmers of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region had accumulated more than 700 billion jin of fertilizer, of which 76 billion jin had been delivered to the fields. This year, due to the people's communes adopting a method of combining the organization of professional fertilizer accumulation teams with the mass movement for fertilizer accumulation, the amount of fertilizer accumulation has increased rapidly compared to previous years. The second work area of the Dengta People's Commune in Chifeng City, Zhaowuda League, has accumulated 158 million jin of fertilizer using this method, with an average of more than 26,000 jin of fertilizer applied per mu, an increase of four and a half times compared to last year.

The people's communes in the autonomous region have opened up a large number of fertilizer sources by adapting to local conditions. People's communes in Zhuozi County, Ulanqab League, have recently successfully trial-produced various native chemical fertilizers using wild plants and phosphate rock and other natural resources. The newly built 214 native chemical fertilizer plants are producing fertilizer day and night. At present, farmers in the autonomous region have newly built 12,382 native chemical fertilizer and bacterial fertilizer plants, producing 595 million jin of native chemical fertilizer and bacterial fertilizer, with an average of 119 jin of fertilizer applied per mu.

In order to accumulate more fertilizer and save time to deliver the fertilizer to the fields, various localities in the autonomous region have vigorously reformed fertilizer accumulation and manure delivery tools. Members of all ethnic groups, cadres, and students in the suburbs of Hohhot City worked together for about ten days to manufacture more than 8,000 fertilizer transportation vehicles, basically realizing the mechanization of fertilizer transportation, greatly accelerating the progress of manure delivery. Twelve communes in Kailu County, Tongliao City, and Aohan Banner have recently built an approximately 150-kilometer-long ice road transportation line and manufactured more than 1,000 sleds (ice sleds) to carry out rapid manure delivery.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 28th: In Heilongjiang Province, which has a cold climate and vast territory, the number of people participating in fertilizer accumulation in rural areas has increased to nearly one million, accounting for about one-quarter of the rural male and female labor force. Currently, more than 1.37 trillion jin of various fertilizers have been accumulated, an increase of more than three times compared to the same period last year. According to the province's preliminary planned planting area for this year, the average fertilizer application per mu can reach more than 16,000 jin, an increase of more than four times compared to the average of 3,000 jin per mu last year.

Based on the characteristics of the large amount of fertilizer accumulation this year, various localities in the province have vigorously mobilized the masses to reform transportation tools to ensure that all the fertilizer is delivered to the fields before spring plowing. Chaoyang People's Commune in Shuangcheng County calculated that if they did not reform the tools, it would take 45 days to deliver all the fertilizer to the fields. Later, they mobilized the masses to take advantage of the winter ice and snow conditions to implement ice road sledding for manure transportation and sled trains, so that all the fertilizer could be delivered to the fields before spring plowing. At present, this commune has poured out 80 large and small ice roads, forming a network of ice roads extending from the manure piles to the fields throughout the commune.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 31st: On January 28th, Shanghai County, with soaring enthusiasm, proposed an agricultural production increase competition to the ten counties in the suburbs of Shanghai, with fertilizer accumulation as the primary condition. This proposal received a warm response from various counties, pushing the fertilizer accumulation movement in the rural areas of the suburbs to a new climax. At present, 400,000 people in various counties have invested in the fertilizer accumulation movement, accumulating 50 million dan of fertilizer every day.

After the New Year, a vigorous fertilizer accumulation movement was launched in the rural areas of eleven counties in the suburbs of Shanghai. The broad masses and cadres braved the severe cold, digging, smoking, composting, fishing, and shoveling, and launched a struggle to extract fertilizer from nature. From January 1st to 29th, 829 million dan of fertilizer have been accumulated in the suburbs of the city.

The characteristic of this fertilizer accumulation movement is that it takes fertilizer accumulation as the leader, driving other tasks, and achieving the effect of "one shot, multiple hits." Songjiang County adopted six combined measures: water conservancy construction and large-scale river mud digging, field management and green manure cultivation, livestock development and stable manure accumulation, general cleaning and pit composting, urban waste management and increased accumulation of human excrement and urine, pest and snail control and accumulation of weed fertilizer and mud fertilizer, which greatly increased the amount of fertilizer accumulation and expanded the fertilizer source, and promoted other tasks. More than 90% of the county's 440,000 mu of green manure crops have become first-class seedlings after strengthening management and cultivation. After Jinshan County adopted this method of driving other tasks with fertilizer accumulation, it accumulated 7.32 million dan of various mud and miscellaneous fertilizers and produced 491,500 jin of native chemical fertilizer in just four days, and completed the work of breaking soil and cultivating soil in all green manure fields.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, January 31st: Whether in the evergreen heartland, the snowy and cold mountainous areas, or the subtropical southern regions of Yunnan Province, a climax has been universally formed in the fertilizer accumulation and production movement. A total of one million people of all ethnic groups across the province are participating in fertilizer accumulation. According to recent statistics, more than 350 billion jin of various fertilizers have been accumulated in the province, an increase of eight times compared to the same period last year. Among them, human and animal manure, native chemical fertilizer, and other high-quality fertilizers account for more than half, which is four times more than all the fertilizers in the same period last year.

In the Zhaotong Prefecture in the Jinsha River Basin, more than 200,000 fertilizer accumulation teams are accumulating fertilizer in the high mountains, singing: "The moon is not bright in the cold winter, wind and snow cannot stop ambitious people, live in the mountains and fight hard to accumulate fertilizer, mountain songs shake the mountains." They shoveled through more than a foot deep of accumulated snow, shoveled out fallen leaves and mountain grass from the forest, and are determined to cut off all the mountain grass and win the red flag before going down the mountain. In the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture on the shores of Erhai Lake, people of all ethnic groups adopted methods such as searching on the mountains, cutting on the plains, sweeping at home, picking outside, fishing in the sea, digging in the ditches, filling in the stables, and manufacturing in factories to accumulate and produce fertilizer on a large scale. They decided to fight hard for a month to achieve 30,000 jin of fertilizer per mu by the end of February and accumulate all the fertilizer needed for the spring before transplanting seedlings. In the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in the Lancang River Basin, after a national fertilizer accumulation blitz week, 27.5 billion jin of fertilizer have been accumulated, an increase of nine times compared to the same period last year. The Lisu people in Bijiang, Lushui, Gongshan, and Fugong counties in the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture have completely changed the habit of people without toilets and animals without padded stables this year, building 1,000 large toilets and large animal stables each, and further launched a national fertilizer accumulation climax under the slogan of "Asking for fertilizer from Biluo Snow Mountain and Gaoligong Mountain" to ensure that 100,000 jin of fertilizer are applied per mu in the spring.

In the national fertilizer accumulation movement, urban people have also taken action. Cadres of government offices, factory workers, students, and military units in various towns in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture decided to donate 5,000 jin of fertilizer per person before the Spring Festival.
