This newspaper Zhengzhou, 19th dispatch: The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a symposium on wheat production from February 14th to 16th, with representatives from twelve counties including Mengxian and Yanshi, and some people's communes participating. The meeting focused on discussing how to strive for a greater wheat harvest this year.

Comrade Tan Zhenlin, a member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, participated in the meeting and delivered a speech.

Participants in the symposium were all advanced counties and communes in wheat production in Henan Province last year. Among them, Mengxian, Yanshi, Xiangxian, Xiping, Lushan, and Quexian were the "Marshal" counties of wheat in 1958. According to reports from various counties, wheat seedlings now have deep roots, are strong, and have many seedlings. Even the worst third-class seedlings are as good as the second-class seedlings, or even first-class seedlings, of past years. The meeting unanimously agreed that there is full confidence in realizing the Henan Provincial Committee's call to "ensure a greater wheat harvest this year, and strive for one season to equal one year." In order to realize the Provincial Committee's call, representatives from the twelve counties and sixteen people's communes attending the meeting widely exchanged advanced experiences in wheat field management, carefully studied measures to further strengthen wheat field management, and issued a proposal to all counties and people's communes in the province, proposing to immediately launch a movement throughout the province to strive to create counties with a per mu wheat yield of two thousand jin, communes with three thousand jin, "fang" with five thousand jin ("fang" refers to high-yield plots, generally large "fang" have tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of mu; small "fang" have hundreds or thousands of mu), and "kuai" with ten thousand jin (each "kuai" is generally three, five, or dozens of mu).

The proposal stated, "Wheat harvest has three treasures: many heads, large ears, and full grains." Now is the wheat regreening season, a decisive period for wheat growth. We must do everything possible to ensure many heads, large ears, and full grains, resolutely eliminate third-class ears, strive for one ear to equal two, and one grain to equal two. High-yield fields must ensure more than 1.5 million ears per mu, with 40 to 50 grains per ear, while general wheat fields must have more than 800,000 ears per mu, with 30 to 40 grains per ear. The proposal also requires all localities to ensure that wheat is well-fed and watered, and to apply three fertilizers and three waterings to each wheat field (regreening, jointing, and heading stages). Vigorously develop high-yield "fang," consolidate first-class seedlings, improve second-class seedlings, and resolutely eliminate third-class seedlings. Conscientiously do a good job in "five preventions" (preventing insects, diseases, frost, lodging, and wind and sand) and weeding, plowing, harrowing, loosening the soil, and preserving moisture. Vigorously carry out tool reform to improve labor efficiency. Conscientiously strengthen leadership and establish a responsibility system.

This newspaper Jinan, 19th dispatch: The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued a new combat mobilization order to the entire party and people of Shandong, calling on everyone to show the ambition and perseverance of "1,000 jin target, 3,000 jin measures, and 10,000 jin of effort" to achieve a bumper harvest this year.

Shou Zhang and Fanxian counties, famous for increasing grain production by about ten times last year, first launched a competition proposal to the province to vow to win counties with a per mu wheat yield of two thousand jin, according to the Provincial Committee's new call. This proposal was immediately enthusiastically responded to by advanced counties such as Licheng and Ningyang. Subsequently, various districts, counties, communes, and teams also launched new competitions one after another. Currently, these counties are all adding water, fertilizer, and strengthening management, fiercely attacking the wheat regreening stage. Shou Zhang County's 140,000-strong fertilizer accumulation army is accumulating, transporting, and applying regreening fertilizer simultaneously. Each commune must accumulate another 2 billion jin of fertilizer before the Jingzhe (Awakening of Insects) solar term, and each mu of wheat field must apply another 30,000 to 50,000 jin of miscellaneous soil fertilizer and 3,000 jin of quick-acting soil-chemical fertilizer. The water conservancy army has also begun to heavily water the regreening fields, determined to water them all thoroughly before the end of February. In some places, to prevent drought and preserve moisture, harrowing, hoeing, and rolling have also generally begun. For wheat fields that cannot be harrowed or hoeed due to dense planting, people have created suitable new tools. For example, Ningyang County has manufactured 20,000 narrow spiked harrows, so that even very dense wheat fields can be loosened and moisture preserved. Under the circumstance of completing various material preparations, Xiajin County has also set up one weather station, eighteen weather outposts, and one thousand one hundred and sixteen sky observation groups, enabling the people of the entire county to effectively grasp weather trends, prevent wheat from being frozen, and have established one thousand and thirty-nine insect control technology groups to strengthen the prevention and control of wheat field pests. Of the more than 80,000 mu of sandy wheat fields in the county, 43,000 mu have now been set up with windbreaks.

In order to strengthen leadership in wheat production, Comrade Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Provincial Committee, took the lead in going down to the Dongjiao People's Commune in Licheng County for a short period of time to become a commune member, and worked with the commune cadres to study and participate in the wheat field management movement centered on fertilizer accumulation. The First Secretaries of party committees at all levels have all gone deep into the grassroots to help the commune party committees redeploy troops and deploy new battles. The red and expert teams that made great achievements on the agricultural production front last year have all been assigned to high-yield plots to carefully manage them, so that every "fang" has a general and every "kuai" has soldiers.

This newspaper Xi'an, 19th dispatch: Shaanxi Province is actively carrying out the movement for high wheat yields of one thousand jin per mu. At present, farmers throughout the province are continuing to process and fertilize wheat fields, striving for a per mu yield of one thousand jin on ten million mu of large-area wheat fields. Eleven counties and two hundred communes are striving to become counties and communes with one thousand jin. Recently, Shuang Wang Brigade of Chengguan People's Commune in Weinan County proposed a challenge competition to all communes in the province for a per mu wheat yield of three thousand jin, which has been enthusiastically responded to by many people's communes in Xi'an City, Xianyang, Sanyuan, Qianxian, Xingping, and other counties. Now, these communes are all organizing labor in a unified manner, promoting a responsibility management system with fixed personnel, fixed time, fixed quantity, and fixed quality, tightly grasping the important juncture of wheat regreening, and taking measures such as splashing urine, spraying fertilizer liquid, and applying ash, etc., to promote more tillering of wheat, and striving for a per mu yield of over three thousand jin.

Shaanxi Province has planted a total of 23 million mu of wheat this year, with a planned per mu yield of more than 650 jin, and a total output of 15 billion jin. The area planted with wheat has decreased by 850,000 mu compared to last summer's harvest, but the per mu yield is to be increased by 216%, and the total output is to be increased by 206%. At present, the wheat growth situation in various places is very good: first-class wheat fields are 13.75 million mu, accounting for 59.8% of the wheat field area, with more than 400,000 to 600,000 plants per mu, generally tillering two to three times. Among them, 1.38 million mu have more than one million plants, accounting for 6% of the wheat field. Second-class wheat fields are 7.29 million mu, accounting for 31.7%, with 300,000 to 400,000 plants per mu, generally tillering one to two times. Third-class wheat fields are 1.96 million mu, accounting for 8.5%, with 200,000 to 300,000 plants per mu, with less tillering. Judging from the above situation, this year's wheat production plan can be achieved.

Recently, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee jointly held a telephone conference, requesting all localities to continue to take effective measures to further process, water, and fertilize wheat fields, make a concentrated effort for three months, and ensure that wheat passes the four stages of regreening, jointing, heading, and grain filling well. At present, various localities plan to apply another 20,000 to 30,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of wheat field recently. Launch a three-watering campaign: the first watering is combined with topdressing during regreening to consolidate effective tillering and increase the number of spikelets per ear; the second watering is after jointing to promote the development of young ears and increase the number of grains; and the third watering is during grain filling to increase grain weight.

    社社奋战　处处竞赛　劲上加劲　精益求精
    小麦亩产千斤运动风起云涌
    河南山东陕西集中力量猛攻返青关
    本报郑州19日电　中共河南省委在2月14日到16日召开了孟县、偃师等十二个县和部分人民公社代表参加的小麦丰产座谈会，集中讨论了如何争取今年小麦更大丰收的问题。
    中共中央政治局委员、书记处书记谭震林同志参加了这次会议，并且在会议上讲了话。
    参加这次座谈会的都是去年河南省小麦生产先进县、社，其中，孟县、偃师、襄县、西平、鲁山、?县等六个县是1958年的小麦“元帅”县。根据各县汇报，现在麦苗根深苗旺、苗多，即使生长最差的三类苗也抵住了过去每年的二类苗，甚至一类苗。会议一致认为：实现河南省委提出的“确保今年小麦更大丰收，力争一季顶一年”的号召，具有充分把握。为了实现省委的号召，到会的十二个县和十六个人民公社的代表，在广泛交流了麦田管理中的先进经验，认真研究了更进一步加强麦田管理的措施的基础上，向全省各县和人民公社发出了倡议书，倡议立即在全省范围内开展一个努力创造亩产小麦双千斤县、三千斤社、五千斤方（“方”指丰产方，一般大方有几万亩或十几万亩；小方有几百亩或几千亩）、万斤块（每块一般是三、五亩或几十亩）的运动。
    倡议书说，“麦收三件宝，头多、穗大、籽又饱”。现在，正是小麦返青季节，是小麦生长的决定性时期，必须千方百计保证头多、穗大、籽饱，坚决消灭三类穗，争取一穗顶两穗，一粒顶两粒。丰产田每亩要保证一百五十万穗以上，每穗四十粒到五十粒，一般麦田每亩八十万穗以上，每穗三十粒到四十粒。倡议书还要求各地保证小麦吃饱喝足，块块麦田再施三肥浇三水（返青、拔节、抽穗）。大搞丰产方，巩固一类苗，提高二类苗，坚决消灭三类苗。认真作好“五防”（防虫、防病、防霜冻、防倒伏、防风沙）和中耕锄草、耙耱松土保墒等工作。大搞工具改革，提高劳动效率。认真加强领导，建立责任制。
    本报济南19日电　中共山东省委最近向山东全党全民又发出了新的战斗动员令，号召大家拿出“一千斤指标，三千斤措施，一万斤干劲”的雄心毅力，实现今年大丰收。
    去年以粮食增产十倍左右而闻名的寿张、范县，首先根据省委这一新的号召，向全省发起了誓夺亩产小麦双千斤县的竞赛倡议，这个倡议立即得到历城、宁阳等先进县的热烈响应。接着，各地、县、社、队，也都接二连三地展开了新的竞赛。目前，这些县都在加水、加肥、加工管理，猛攻小麦返青关。寿张县十四万积肥大军，边积、边运、边追返青肥，每个公社都要在惊蛰前再积二十亿斤肥，每亩麦田再追三至五万斤土杂肥和三千斤速效土化肥；水利大军也开始大浇返青水，决心在2月底以前普浇一遍。范县已经井井提水、库库开闸，渠渠放水，争取块块浇透。有些地方为了防旱保墒，还普遍开始耙、锄、砘轧。因密植不能耙、锄的麦田，人们都创造了适宜的新工具，如宁阳县已制造窄钉耙两万件，使很密的麦田也能松土保墒。夏津县在作好各种物资准备的情况下，又设立了一处气象站、十八处气象哨、一千一百一十六个观天小组，使全县人民切实掌握天气动向，不使小麦受冻，并且建立了一千零三十九个治虫技术小组，加强麦田虫害的防治工作。全县八万多亩沙地麦田，今年已有四万三千亩搭起了风障。
    为了加强小麦丰产领导，省委第一书记舒同同志带头短期下放到历城县东郊人民公社当社员，和社干部一起研究并参加以积肥为中心的麦田管理运动。各级党委第一书记都深入到了基层，帮助公社党委重新调兵遣将，部署新战斗。去年在农业生产战线上大显身手的红专队伍，都调配到大丰产方里，精心管治，使方方有将、块块有兵。
    本报西安19日电　陕西省积极开展小麦千斤亩丰产运动。目前，全省农民正继续给麦田加工加肥，力争一千万亩大面积麦田亩产一千斤。十一个县和二百个公社都正为争取千斤县和千斤公社而奋斗。最近，渭南县城关人民公社双王大队向全省各公社提出亩产小麦三千斤的挑战竞赛，已得到西安市、咸阳、三原、乾县、兴平等县许多人民公社的热烈响应。现在，这些公社都统一组织劳力，推行定员、定时、定量、定质的责任管理制，紧紧抓住小麦返青这个重要关口，采取泼尿，喷肥料液，上草木灰等办法，促进小麦多分蘖，力争亩产超过三千斤。
    陕西省今年共种植小麦二千三百万亩，计划亩产六百五十多斤，总产要达到一百五十亿斤，小麦种植的面积比去年夏收减少了八十五万亩，但亩产要比去年提高216％，总产要增加206％。目前，各地小麦生长的情况很好：一类麦田一千三百七十五万亩，占麦田面积的59.8％，每亩四十至六十万株以上，一般分蘖二至三个。其中一百万株以上的一百三十八万亩，占麦田6％。二类麦田七百二十九万亩，占31.7％，每亩三十至四十万株，一般分蘖一至二个。三类麦田一百九十六万亩，占8.5％，每亩二十至三十万株，分蘖较少。从以上情况看来，今年的小麦丰产计划是可以实现的。
    最近，省委和省人委又联合举行电话会议，要求各地继续采取有效措施，进一步给麦田加工、加水、加肥，突击三个月，保证小麦过好返青、拔节、孕穗、灌浆四道关。目前，各地计划在最近给每亩麦田再追施肥料两、三万斤。开展三水运动，第一水在返青时结合追肥浇，巩固有效分蘖，增加每穗的小穗数；第二水拔节后浇，促进幼穗发育，增加粒数；第三水在灌浆时浇，增加颗粒重量。
