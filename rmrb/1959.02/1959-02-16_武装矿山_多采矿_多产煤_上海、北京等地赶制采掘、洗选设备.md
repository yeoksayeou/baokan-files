Arming the Mines: More Mining, More Coal Production
Shanghai, Beijing and other places rush to manufacture mining, extraction, and washing equipment

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. The Shanghai Mining Machinery Plant is doing everything possible to rush manufacture of mining equipment to support mining, coal mining, and coal washing industries in various regions. In January, the entire plant produced 123 units of mining equipment such as crushers, hoists, and forging drills. The various crushers alone can replace the manual labor of more than 100,000 people, crushing more than 30,000 tons of ore per day. Recently, the factory received a crash task to manufacture 100 crushers for simple coal washing plants. All employees of the factory have immediately taken action and are treating it as the most important production project to complete.

This year, in order to support the country in achieving 18 million tons of steel, the Shanghai Mining Machinery Plant has a large task of manufacturing mining equipment. Last year, the plant's production task increased by 139% compared to the previous year. This year's preliminary plan is to increase it by another 40% compared to last year, and the product specifications are large and there are many new products.

All employees of the plant are launching a mass technical innovation movement to solve a number of key problems in the current production. The forging and riveting workshop did not have mechanical equipment for bending large cylinders, and in the past relied on semi-manual and semi-mechanical operation, which had low efficiency and a long processing cycle. This time, workers and technicians worked together to manufacture an indigenous machine, which increased production efficiency nearly a hundredfold compared to the original. Engineer Wang Siping and veteran worker Qiu Fengfa cooperated to make a spring hammer, which can forge outer circle forgings of 60 to 70 mm, solving the difficulty of insufficient small forging equipment.

In order to achieve this year's leap forward targets, the factory is also actively manufacturing large-scale indigenous equipment to arm itself. From the factory headquarters to the workshops, indigenous equipment groups have been established, planning to rush manufacture 15 sets of large-scale indigenous equipment and more than 100 sets of medium and small-sized equipment in the first quarter.

Xinhua News Agency: Workers at the Beijing No. 3 General Machinery Factory are actively rushing to manufacture mining equipment such as bucket elevators, scraper coal distribution machines, ball mills, and crushers for mining departments. The production efficiency of these mining equipment is very high. Large ball mills weighing more than 60 tons can process 7.5 tons of ore per hour; jaw crushers can process 20 tons of ore per hour, and mining transportation equipment such as scraper coal distribution machines and tippler can transport about 350 tons of ore per hour.

In the production of these mining equipment, the workers vigorously engaged in technological revolution and manufactured some simple large machine tools to process the large parts of these mining equipment.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang: The Guiyang Mining Machinery Plant is stepping up the production of mining equipment to support mining construction in various regions. From the beginning of January to now, the factory has produced more than 400 sets of equipment such as forging drills, hoists, ore crushers, and mine cars.

In the first quarter of this year, the Guiyang Mining Machinery Plant will produce a total of more than 30 types of different types of forging, crushing and beneficiation machinery and equipment for various regions; in addition to the equipment manufactured for newly built factories and mines in Guiyang City and other places, the production task in the first quarter will increase more than three times compared with the same period last year. All employees of the plant have worked hard and cleverly to produce these products quickly and transport them to various places in a timely manner. In order to maximize equipment capacity, they implemented a three-shift system to ensure that people can rest but the machines never stop, while at the same time building indigenous machine tools to arm themselves. In terms of raw materials, they also vigorously engaged in technological innovation, adopting methods of combining small pieces into large ones and using castings instead of forgings to solve the problem. In January, the entire plant overfulfilled the total output value task by 1.4% due to the adoption of various measures.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Luoyang: The newly built modern Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant will exert greater power this year to manufacture more and better mechanical equipment for the mining and metallurgical sectors. According to the production plan already arranged by the factory, the production tasks it will complete in the first quarter of this year alone will be 70% greater than the actual production tasks completed last year. In terms of varieties, there are metallurgical and sintering equipment, and there are mining, excavation, washing, crushing and grinding equipment.

Since January, under the leadership of the factory Party committee and the Party branches of various departments and workshops, all employees of the factory have conducted heated discussions on the production plan for the first quarter and put forward measures to complete the plan. Employees in the metalworking workshop proposed that they should continue to mobilize the masses in depth, strive to double the output with double the effort, and produce two hoists per day. The measures they adopted were: to fully utilize the potential of existing equipment; to combine indigenous and foreign methods, build indigenous machine tools on a large scale, and modify foreign machine tools; to make their own tooling; and to give full play to the enthusiasm of apprentices and implement technical matching of new and old workers. In the discussion of the plan, the workers in the foundry workshop formulated a competition plan centered on vigorously engaging in technological revolution, requiring ensuring output, ensuring quality, ensuring savings, and ensuring safety in the competition. Now, the factory leadership has made a preliminary plan to complete the annual task based on the urgency of the country's product requirements, as well as the situation and suggestions of the employees' discussions of the plan.

    武装矿山　多采矿　多产煤
    上海、北京等地赶制采掘、洗选设备
    新华社上海电　上海矿山机器厂正千方百计赶制矿山设备，支援各地采矿、采煤、洗煤工业。1月份全厂生产了一百二十三台破碎机、卷扬机和锻钎机等矿山设备，其中仅各种破碎机便可代替十万多人的体力劳动，每天能够破碎三万多吨矿石。最近，这个厂又接到了制造简易洗煤厂用的一百台破碎机的突击任务。全厂职工已立即行动起来，把它作为当前最重要的生产项目来完成。
    今年，上海矿山机器厂为了支援全国实现一千八百万吨钢，担负的矿山设备制造任务很大。去年全厂生产任务比前年增长了139％，今年初步规划又将比去年增长40％，而且产品规格大、新产品多。
    全厂职工正在掀起一个群众性的技术革新运动，解决当前生产中的若干关键问题。锻铆车间没有弯大圆筒的机械设备，过去依靠半手工半机械操作，效率低、加工周期长；这次工人、技术人员一起制造了一台土机器，比原来生产效率提高近一百倍。工程师王思平和老工人丘凤法合作制成了弹簧鎯头，可以锻造六十到七十公厘的外圆锻件，解决了小型锻件设备不足的困难。
    为了实现今年的跃进指标，这个厂还积极制造大型土设备来武装自己。从厂部到车间都成立了土设备小组，计划在一季度内赶制十五台大型土设备和一百多台中小型设备。
    新华社讯　北京市第三通用机械厂工人正在积极为采矿部门赶制斗子式提升机、刮板配煤机、球磨机、破碎机等矿山设备。这批矿山设备生产效率都很高，六十多吨重的大型球磨机，每小时能加工矿石七吨半；颚式破碎机每小时能加工矿石二十吨，刮板配煤机和翻车机等矿山运输设备，每小时能运输矿石三百五十吨左右。
    工人们在生产这些矿山设备中，大闹技术革命，制造了一些简易的大型机床来加工这些矿山设备的大部件。
    新华社贵阳电　贵阳矿山机器厂正在加紧生产矿山设备，支援各地矿山建设。从1月初到现在，全厂已生产出锻钎机、卷扬机、碎矿机和矿车等设备四百多部。
    贵阳矿山机器厂今年第一季度将为各地生产不同类型的锻压、破碎和选矿等机器设备共三十多种；加上为贵阳市等地新建厂矿制造的设备在内，第一季度的生产任务要比去年同时期增长三倍以上。全厂职工为了把这些产品迅速生产出来，并且及时运往各地，都顽强地苦干巧干。为了发挥设备能力，他们实行了三班制，做到人停机器不停，同时大制土机床武装自己。在原材料方面也大闹技术革新，采取以小拼大、以铸代锻的办法来解决。在1月份中，全厂就由于采取各种措施，超额1.4％完成了生产总值任务。
    据新华社洛阳电　新建的现代化洛阳矿山机器厂今年将发挥更大的威力，为采矿和冶金部门制造更多更好的机械设备。根据厂里已经安排好的生产计划，仅今年第一季度它要完成的生产任务，就比去年实际完成的生产任务大70％。在品种方面，有冶金和烧结设备，有采掘、洗选、破碎研磨设备等。
    1月份以来，全厂职工在工厂党委和各科室、车间党支部的领导下，对第一季度的生产计划进行了热烈讨论，纷纷提出了完成计划的措施。金工车间职工提出，要继续深入发动群众，用双倍的干劲争取产量加一番，日产双台卷扬机。他们所采取的措施是：充分发挥现有设备潜力；土洋并举，大造土机床，改装洋机床；自制工卡具；发挥学徒工积极性，实行新老工人技术搭配。铸工车间职工在讨论计划中，制定了以大闹技术革命为中心的竞赛方案，要求在竞赛中做到保产量、保质量、保节约、保安全。现在，厂的领导上已经根据国家对于产品要求的轻重缓急，以及职工们讨论计划的情况和建议，作出了完成全年任务的初步规划。（附图片）
