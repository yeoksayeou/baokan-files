    Seize the Auspicious Snow to Preserve Soil Moisture
    Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences
    The widespread auspicious snow in North China on February 24th and 25th is extremely beneficial for the greening of winter wheat and spring plowing and planting. Grasping the opportunity to earnestly preserve soil moisture and manage wheat fields is of great importance to promoting a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year.
    Although the base soil moisture of winter wheat last autumn and winter was relatively sufficient, the deep plowing, dense planting, and heavy fertilization have increased the demand for water. Moreover, since the beginning of winter, most areas have experienced little rain and snow. For example, in Beijing, the precipitation from November to this snowfall was only 11.1 millimeters, less than 50% of the normal precipitation for the same period. Although the area of winter-irrigated wheat fields has expanded compared to last year, non-winter-irrigated wheat fields still account for a certain proportion. This year, the greening of wheat has started about half a month earlier than usual. Currently, the winter wheat area in the north is starting to green. To ensure a smooth passage through the greening stage and lay the foundation for more ears, larger ears, and more grains, timely supply of water and nutrients needed for wheat greening is the primary task of current wheat field management. Judging from the snowfall in the Beijing area, which has reached 30 millimeters of water, it has basically met the need for greening water. This not only greatly saves labor for artificial irrigation but also allows the vast wheat fields to receive an appropriate amount of water simultaneously, solving the defect of often delaying irrigation due to limited irrigation conditions. Although the amount of snowfall in other areas is less, it has also eased the tension of spring irrigation. Fully estimating the role of this snowfall and striving to exert its effectiveness is what we should pay attention to at present.
    After winter wheat greens, on the one hand, the plants themselves need a lot of water, and on the other hand, the ground evaporation also gradually increases. Therefore, after the snow melts, we should earnestly do a good job in preserving soil moisture in the wheat fields so that the water can be fully and effectively utilized by the wheat. This year, most of the topdressing fertilizer for wheat fields is farm manure. This snow water has an extremely good effect on promoting the decomposition and utilization of fertilizer. Wheat fields that have not yet been topdressed, whether dry land or irrigated land, should take advantage of the soil moisture to apply fertilizer as early as possible, and then harrow or hoe the land (light harrowing is recommended to avoid harrowing teeth from entering the soil too deep and injuring the seedlings), so that the manure and soil are fused, and the fertilizer is dissolved in time for absorption and utilization by the wheat.
    Judging from past experience and this spring's temperature situation, if the weather is sunny after the snow stops, it is estimated that the snow will melt quickly, and short-term coverage will not affect the seedlings. When the snow melts, the soil moisture will lose part of its latent heat, and the ground temperature will be slightly reduced. However, the weather will return to normal one to two days after the weather is clear. If the weather is cloudy after the snow stops and the temperature drops, the snow melting period in the wheat fields will be longer, which may be unfavorable for some high-yield fields with large planting density, excessive growth before winter, and failure to remove the barnyard manure used for frost protection in time, as well as low-lying and wet wheat fields. Some wood ash should be applied according to the specific conditions to promote snow melting and avoid yellowing of seedlings caused by long-term coverage. After the snow melts, if there is a sudden cold, the soil may experience alternating freezing and thawing, which may cause wheat root pulling. Timely rolling should be carried out to prevent frost damage or dry wind attacks. According to past experience, watering urine when it snows in winter or when the snow has not melted easily causes freezing and death of wheat seedlings. This may be because the snow melts quickly after watering urine, the wheat seedlings are exposed, and the temperature is low during the snow melting process, which causes frost damage. Although the current temperature is high, it is still advisable to wait until the snow melts before watering.
    The experience of spring wheat bumper harvest in 1958 proves that early sowing is an important link to ensure a bumper harvest. At present, the spring wheat area in North China is in the appropriate sowing period. We should take advantage of the soil moisture to prepare the land and sow in time. Generally, the sowing period for large autumn crops is more than a month away from now. Although the soil moisture is good in areas with more snowfall this time, the evaporation will gradually increase after the Jingzhe solar term. If we do not do a good job in preserving soil moisture, it will still cause a lack of soil moisture or difficulty in sowing. Therefore, we must take advantage of the snowmelt to mobilize all forces in a comprehensive manner to carry out a blitz of harrowing and preserving soil moisture. This is of decisive significance for striving for a greater bumper harvest this year. Areas with less snowfall should pay special attention to this.

    趁瑞雪抓保墒
    中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所
    2月24日和25日，华北各地普降瑞雪，这无论对冬小麦返青或春耕备种，都是极有利的条件。抓紧时机，认真做好保墒和麦田管理工作，对促进今年农业生产大丰收具有重要作用。
    去秋冬小麦的底墒虽较充足，但由于耕的深，种的密，施肥多，对水分的要求也大。而且入冬以来，大部分地区雨雪较少，以北京为例，从11月到这次降雪前降水量仅十一点一毫米，尚不及常年同期降水量的50％。去年冬浇麦田面积虽有扩大，但未冬浇麦田仍占一定比重，今年小麦返青较常年提早半月左右，目前北方冬麦区正开始返青，为了确保返青关的顺利通过，为穗多、穗大、粒多奠定基础，及时供应小麦返青所需水分和养分是当前麦田管理的首要任务。从北京地区降雪量已达三十毫米的水量看来，基本上已满足了返青水的需要，这样不仅大大节省了人工灌溉的劳力，而且使广大麦田同时得到适量的水分，解决了往往因灌溉条件所限，不得不延迟浇水的缺陷。其他各地的降雪量虽较少，但也缓冲了春灌的紧张情况。充分估计到这次降雪的作用，并尽力发挥其功效，是我们当前应该注意的问题。
    冬小麦返青以后，一方面植物本身需要大量水分，一方面地面蒸发量也随之渐增，因而雪化以后，应切实做好麦田的保墒工作，使水分能充分有效地为小麦所利用。今年麦田追肥大部分为农家肥料，这场雪水对促进肥料的分解利用具有极为良好的作用，未及追肥的麦田，无论旱地或水浇地应趁墒尽早追施，然后耙耱或锄地（应轻耙，以免耙齿入土过深伤苗壅土），使粪土融合，肥分及时溶解为小麦所吸收利用。
    从以往经验和今春气温情况看来，如果雪停后天气晴朗，估计积雪很快就会融化，短期复盖对幼苗不会有影响。积雪融化时，土壤水分随之要散失一部分潜热，地温略有降低情况，但天气晴和后一至二天，即可恢复正常，如雪停后天气阴霾，气温转低，麦田积雪融化时期较长，对一些种植密度较大，冬前表现徒长和复盖厩肥防冻未及取出的丰产田以及低湿麦田可能不利，应根据具体条件撒施一些草木灰，可以促进积雪融化，避免麦苗因长期复盖而引起黄苗情况。融雪过后若有骤寒，土壤可能发生结冻和解冻的交替作用，而引起小麦根拔的现象，应该适时镇压，以防止冻害或旱风侵袭。据以往经验在冬季降雪或积雪尚未融化时浇尿，容易发生冻死麦苗情况，这可能由于浇尿后积雪很快融化，麦苗暴露，而在融雪过程中气温较低，以至引起冻害，目前的气温虽较高，但仍以待积雪融化后再浇为妥。
    1958年春小麦丰产经验证明，提早播种是保证丰产的重要环节，目前华北春麦区正是播种适期，应趁墒及时整地播种，一般大秋作物的播种期离现在还有一个多月，这次降雪量较多的地区虽然墒情较好，但惊蛰节后蒸发量渐增，如果不做好保墒工作，仍将造成缺墒或播种的困难，因此必须趁化雪后及时动员一切力量，全面进行耙耱保墒的突击工作，对于争取今年更大丰收有决定意义，降雪量较少的地区尤应重视。
