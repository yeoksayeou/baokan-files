    Wells Fails to Solve the "Russian Enigma"
    Dong Ruisen
    Thirty-nine years ago, an upright but insignificant "petty bourgeois" came to the great Soviet land, which was struggling against hardship and difficulty. He left us a booklet that quite objectively reflected the reality of Soviet Russia at that time, but also contained prejudiced and ignorant nonsense. This person was the British novelist and political commentator H.G. Wells, and this work is called "Russia in the Shadows." Wells went to Soviet Russia in the autumn of 1920. He met with Lenin; he observed for fifteen days in Petrograd and Moscow, and upon returning to England, he wrote this booklet. This book happened to destroy the rumors spread by the world's reactionaries against Soviet Russia, and he carried out limited but fair publicity. The reactionaries had to rush out and declare that this was a bad book! Lenin himself paid great attention to this book, and he read it very carefully. Although Lenin said after meeting Wells that Wells was a representative of the "petty bourgeoisie" and that he was a philistine, Lenin made many marginal notes in the original book, which shows that he attached great importance to the situation reflected by the author and the author's ravings. This book was reprinted in Russian in the Soviet Union last year, and now it has been translated into Chinese and published.
    Why is the author said to be upright? Because the book relatively objectively depicts the economic chaos and difficult life in the Soviet land at that time. Even today, this is one of the few chapters with vivid descriptions, just as John Reed's "Ten Days That Shook the World" truthfully reflects the reality of the October Revolution. The author also dared to point out that this chaos was not the fault of the Communist Party, but was caused by the imperialist war and the intervention and blockade of imperialist countries. The author also affirmed that only the Communist Party could control and transform this country. But for Wells, how could this country be revived? It has always been a mystery. He could not see how this mystery would be revealed, and he had no confidence. When Lenin showed him the grand plan of national electrification, Wells could only think of it as modern utopia! This is the tragedy of this petty bourgeois. This is the insignificance of this character! Lenin put forward his famous bold statement to him: Come and see again in ten years! Fourteen years later, Wells did come to the Soviet Union again, and he had to praise the great achievements of socialist construction, and gradually reduced his ignorance in the face of reality. After the Second World War, before his death, he also expressed his support for the British Communist Party in the general election.
    The most interesting thing is that this master of writing science fiction novels, who was able to describe atomic explosions and interstellar travel decades ago, was unable to imagine its future when he personally visited this "modern utopia"! Not only that, in this booklet he also published some ignorant fallacies, saying that it is inconceivable to divide human beings into proletarians and property owners, saying that a worker taking a train is equivalent to him also being an employer, and so on. Even middle school students would laugh at these "conclusions," but they still appear from time to time in this well-intentioned work.
    At a time when artificial satellites are already orbiting the sun, and when the comprehensive construction of communism is being carried out enthusiastically in this "mysterious" land, revisiting the history of the 1920s is very enlightening. The educational significance of this book lies in this. No matter how difficult and arduous the tasks are, they can be solved in front of the communists, and what miracles cannot be created by the liberated people? History is the best witness, but unfortunately the author passed away thirteen years ago, otherwise he might have bowed his head in the face of reality.

    威尔斯解不了“俄罗斯之谜”
    栋榕森
    三十九年前，一个正直但是渺小的“小市民”，来到了刚好与艰难困苦搏斗的伟大的苏维埃国土。他给我们留下了一部相当客观地反映了当时苏维埃俄国现实但又带着偏见与无知的胡说的小册子。这个人就是英国的小说家和政论家威尔斯，这本著作叫做“俄罗斯之谜”。威尔斯是1920年秋去苏俄的，他会见了列宁；他在彼得格勒和莫斯科观察了十五天，回到英国就写了这本小册子。这本书却正好击毁了当时世界反动派对苏俄的造谣，他进行了有局限性的但是公正的宣传。反动派只得连忙出来声明这是一本坏书了！列宁本人是很注意这本书的，他读得很认真；尽管列宁跟威尔斯见面之后，说威尔斯是“小市民”的代表者，说他是一个市侩，但是列宁却在原书作了不少眉批，由此可见他是很重视作者所反映的状况和作者的呓语的。这本书去年苏联重印了俄译本，现在已译成中文出版了。
    为什么说作者是正直的呢？因为书中比较客观地描绘了当时苏维埃国土的经济混乱与困难的生活，直到如今，这还是有数的形象化描写的篇章之一，恰如美国的约翰·里德“震撼世界的十月”如实地反映了十月革命的真实一样。作者并且敢于指出，这混乱并非共产党的罪过，这是帝国主义战争和帝国主义国家干涉和封锁所引起的；作者还肯定地认为只有共产党才能够驾驭和改造这个国家。但是对于威尔斯，这个国土怎样能够复兴呢？始终是一个谜。他看不出这个谜将如何揭晓，他没有信心。当列宁向他展示全国电气化的宏伟计划时，威尔斯只能认为这是现代的乌托邦！这就是这个小市民的悲剧。这就是这个人物渺小的所在！列宁向他提出了有名的豪语：你十年后再来看看吧！十四年后威尔斯果然又到苏联，他不得不称赞社会主义建设的伟大成就，在现实的面前渐渐的减少了他的无知。到第二次大战后，他在去世以前也表示过在大选中支持英国的共产党。
    最有趣的是，这位写科学幻想小说的能手，能够在几十年前描写过原子爆炸，描写过星际旅行，亲临这个“现代乌托邦”时却又对它的前途认为不可想像！不仅如此，在这小册子中他还发表了一些无知的谬论，说什么把人类分成无产者和有产者是不可思议的，说一个工人坐了火车即等于他也是雇主，如此等等，即使是中学生看起来也要发笑的“论断”，竟然不时出现在这部善良的著作里。
    在人造行星已经绕着太阳运转的时候，在全面建设共产主义正在这“谜”一样的国土火热地进行着的时候，重温一下二十年代的历史是有很大启发的，这本书的教育意义就是在此。多么艰难困苦，在共产主义者面前都是能够解决的，而被解放了的人民，什么奇迹创造不出来？历史是最好的见证，可惜作者在十三年前离开人世了，否则他也可能在现实面前低头的。
