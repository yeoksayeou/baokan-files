Xinhua News Agency, February 11th – Cadres from Beijing Mining College visited Xin Dian Village in the suburbs of Beijing, where they had previously participated in manual labor, to offer Spring Festival greetings to the villagers on the day of the festival. The villagers came out to welcome them.

Production Brigade Leader Gao Mingru took them to his home, and Aunt Gao quickly brewed tea to serve them. The cadres hung the New Year pictures they brought on the wall, delighting Gao Mingru, who couldn't stop praising them to his wife.

Aunt Kang in the village had cared for Chen Jiashu, a cadre who was sent down, as if he were her own son. Now, the cadres who were sent down all came to see Aunt Kang. The female comrades put flowers on Aunt Kang, and the male comrades filled Aunt Kang's arms with fruit. Aunt Kang was as happy as if she were seeing her own children, and she couldn't close her mouth with joy.

Cong Huiying, another cadre who was sent down, was surrounded by the children from the nursery. Cong Huiying had worked here as a childcare worker, and the children affectionately called her "Auntie." She gave the children the small whistles she had brought.

    据新华社11日讯　北京矿业学院的干部在春节那天到他们曾经下放劳动过的北京郊区辛店村给乡亲们拜年。乡亲们都出来欢迎。
    生产大队长高明儒把他们带到家里，高大妈赶紧沏茶招待他们。下放干部把带来的年画贴在墙上，乐得高明儒向自己的老伴夸不绝口。
    这个村的一位康大妈曾经像待自己的亲生子一样地照顾过下放干部陈家树，现在下放干部们都来看康大妈，女同志给康大妈戴花，男同志在康大妈怀里塞满了水果。康大妈像看到自己儿女一样乐得嘴都合不拢。
    另一个下放干部丛会英被托儿所的小孩子们包围了，丛会英在这里当过保育员，孩子们亲切地叫她阿姨，她把带来的小哨子送给了孩子们。
