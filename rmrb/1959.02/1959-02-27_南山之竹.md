    "Bamboo of Nanshan"
    Wang Weixuan
    The "Kongzi Jiayu" (Confucian Family Sayings) records a story of Zilu and Confucius discussing the issue of learning: Zilu, perhaps a little reluctant to study diligently, found an excuse and said to Confucius: The bamboo on Nanshan grows straight without cultivation. When cut down for use, it can pierce rhinoceros hide. In that case, why do people need to learn? Thereupon, Confucius persuaded Zilu: The bamboo of Nanshan is certainly sharp, but if it were fitted with feathers and iron arrowheads to make arrows, wouldn't it be even sharper? (See "Zilu's First Meeting" Chapter 19). Confucius' metaphor is very apt. The ideological content embedded in this metaphor still has a positive effect on us today.
    For example, in education. The Party advocates combining education with productive labor to cultivate and train the younger generation. This is like adding feathers and iron arrowheads to the sharp bamboo of Nanshan, complementing each other and being invincible. Some people think that education is just reading books and they look down on labor. Others think that since labor can transform thought, it seems that book knowledge can be learned less. The former is a reflection of bourgeois ideology, and the latter is a one-sidedness of ideological methods. What we advocate is the combination of education and productive labor. Paying attention to only one aspect or the other is more or less committing the same mistake as Zilu.
    The core of Marxist educational theory is the combination of education and productive labor. We advocate working on one hand and studying on the other. Because practice is the source of all knowledge, a great deal of knowledge can be learned through productive labor. Only by combining education and productive labor on a more perfect basis, participating in productive labor while systematically teaching basic theoretical knowledge, will we learn better and understand more thoroughly; theory in turn guides labor practice. The two are complementary.
    Some people say: "Don't 'native experts' serve the construction even without learning much theoretical knowledge?" Indeed, since the Great Leap Forward, tens of thousands of native experts have emerged across the country. They have played an amazing role in building socialism. They are able to dare to think, dare to act, break superstitions, summarize their rich experience in the practice of productive labor, and apply it to the cause of socialist construction. However, if it were not for the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China depriving the broad masses of workers and peasants of the opportunity to learn cultural knowledge, then their achievements would be even greater. Therefore, as long as conditions permit, native experts are still eagerly hoping to improve themselves. Our country is also doing its best to enable workers and peasants with practical production experience to master cultural and scientific knowledge faster and more. Today, our young students have better learning opportunities and learning environments than in any historical era. Gorky said that in his youth he was "willing to be beaten to study," and thinking of this makes us feel that today's young students are simply the embodiment of happiness!
    As for combining with labor and mastering more knowledge from actual production, that is even incomparable to any previous generation. Aren't many middle-aged people enviously saying that they would like to live a few more years of student life? The Party's wise and correct educational policy is blossoming more and more brilliantly every day!
    Let us study diligently on one hand and work actively on the other. Let "Bamboo of Nanshan" be "fletched and feathered, sharpened and honed," shooting into the innermost layers of scientific mysteries, and let the policy of "combining education with productive labor" radiate the light of thought!

    “南山之竹”
    王威宣
    “孔子家语”中记载了一则子路和孔子谈论学习问题的故事：子路大概有点不想用功读书了，他找到了一个借口，便对孔子说：南山上的竹子，不用去培植它就长得很直，砍伐下来使用，能够把犀牛的皮穿透，这样看来，人何必学习呢？于是，孔子便说服子路：南山上的竹子固然锋利，但如果把它装上羽毛和铁镞做成箭，不是更加锋利了吗？（见“子路初见”第十九）。孔子所打的比喻是很恰当的。这个比喻中所蕴藏的思想内容，对于我们今天也还有积极作用。
    例如教育工作。党是主张教育和生产劳动相结合来培养、锻炼青年一代的。这就好比在锋利的南山之竹上再装上羽毛和铁镞，相得益彰，无往不利。有些人以为教育就是念书，轻视劳动，也有的以为劳动既然可以改造思想，似乎书本知识就可以少学了。前一种是资产阶级思想的反映，后一种则是思想方法的片面性。我们主张的是教育与生产劳动相结合。只注意这一面或者那一面，就或多或少地犯了像子路那样的毛病。
    马克思主义教育理论的核心是教育与生产劳动的结合。我们主张一面劳动，一面读书。因为实践是一切知识的泉源，所以，通过劳动生产可以学到许许多多知识。也只有把教育与生产劳动在更完善的基础上结合起来，一边参加生产劳动，一边系统地讲授基础理论知识，才会使我们学习得更好，认识得更透彻；理论反过来指导劳动实践。二者正是相辅相成的。
    有人说：“土专家没有学多少理论知识，不是同样可以为建设服务吗？”不错，大跃进以来，全国土专家数以万计地涌现。他们在建设社会主义事业中发挥了惊人的作用。他们能够敢想敢干，破除迷信，在生产劳动实践中总结自己的丰富经验，并把它应用于社会主义建设事业中。但是，如果不是半封建半殖民地的旧中国使广大工农群众失去学习文化知识的机会的话，那末，他们的成绩将会更大。因此，只要条件允许，土专家也还是殷切地希望提高自己的。我们国家也尽力使有生产实践经验的工农群众更快地、更多地掌握文化科学知识。今天，我们的青年学生有了比历史上任何时代都更良好的学习机会和学习环境。高尔基说过，他在少年时代“为了读书，情愿挨一顿打”，想到这话，使我们感到今天的青年学生简直是个幸福的化身！
    至于同劳动相结合，从实际生产中掌握更多的知识，那更是过去任何一代人都比不上的，不是许多中年人都在羡慕地说很想再过几年学生生活吗？党的英明正确的教育方针，正在一天天开放出更多的灿烂的花朵来！
    让我们一面认真学习，一面积极劳动。让“南山之竹”“栝而羽之，镞而砺之”，射入科学之迷的最里层，使“教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针发射出思想的光芒！
