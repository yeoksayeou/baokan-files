Service-Oriented Work is Noble Work
    Lin Zhun

    The development of collective welfare undertakings in rural areas requires many people to engage in this work. Currently, many Party members, Youth League members, and activists in rural areas have happily taken up these positions, serving as cooks, nursery workers, and other service personnel. How should society recognize their labor? How should cooks, nursery workers, and other service personnel view these jobs themselves? Are these jobs noble or "despicable"? Are they promising or without potential? These are recognition issues that urgently need to be resolved.

    We believe that engaging in service-oriented work is noble and not "despicable" at all. Many of our comrades working in public canteens get up early and go to bed late, diligently studying and preparing various kinds of meals so that everyone can eat their fill, eat well, and eat cleanly and hygienically. For the elderly, children, the sick, and new mothers, they also carefully and specially prepare suitable meals, even delivering them to their doors. Isn't this noble work? Comrades working in nurseries and kindergartens raise and care for other people's children as if they were their own, ensuring that the children live well and are educated well, relieving the burdens of the children's fathers and mothers and enabling them to work and produce with peace of mind. Isn't this noble work? Caring about the warmth and comfort of the elderly, being considerate of their feelings, and enabling helpless elderly people to spend their twilight years comfortably and happily – isn't this also noble work? However, even today, some people in society, and even some comrades engaged in service work, do not adequately recognize the significance of this work, believing that these jobs are inferior. This kind of thinking is influenced by the old society. In the old society, in the eyes of the exploiters, all working people, including those so-called "servers," were "despicable." Only those who did not work but were served were considered "noble." This relationship was the relationship between the exploiter and the exploited. This kind of service work was indeed regarded as inferior and despicable. However, in order to survive, people had no choice but to engage in this kind of work, which naturally led to a psychology of unwillingness to engage in and contempt for this kind of work. In today's society, the exploiting classes have been completely overthrown, and the relationship between people has fundamentally changed. There is no longer a division of labor between exploiters and the exploited in society, only a division of labor. Within the people, everyone's labor serves the people, and can also be said to "serve" others. I "serve" you in this matter, and you "serve" me in that matter. There is no one who is exclusively "served" by others. Conversely, there is no one who is not "served" by anyone. This is the new type of relationship between people in the new society, and it is also the normal relationship between the individual, the collective, and society in the new society.

    Service work done by cooks, nursery workers and other service workers must not be regarded as insignificant trivialities, they are essential and important work for building socialism and communism. Eating, raising children, and caring for the elderly are matters that every family and every individual cares about. Even when families were the basic unit of life, these tasks could not be ignored. Our Party has always valued people's housework and opposed the unhealthy ideological tendency of belittling housework. Today, people no longer live in single-family households; instead, a township or a commune has become a large family. It is even more important to do a good job of tasks such as eating, dressing, and raising children in this large family. Because when the family was the basic unit of life, poor housework in one family only affected that family. After the socialization of housework, if any canteen, nursery, or home for the elderly is not run well, it will affect dozens or even hundreds of families, affecting the lives of hundreds or even thousands of people. We all know that production and life are closely linked. Only when people's lives are well taken care of can they engage in production and labor with energy and without worries. And the ultimate goal of people's wholehearted engagement in labor and production is to continuously improve their lives, making life happier and more fulfilling day by day. Continuously improving people's material and cultural life on the basis of developing production is the basic economic law of our socialist society. In order for production to continue to develop, society needs various different divisions of labor. Some people engage in industrial and agricultural labor, directly creating material wealth for society, and their labor is undoubtedly glorious. While others, such as cooks, nursery workers, and other service personnel, their labor does not directly create material wealth for society, but without their labor, it would affect the labor of the former group, which would affect the production of material wealth. Therefore, how can it be said that the work of the former group is important and glorious, while the work of the latter group is unimportant and not glorious? We must understand that society is an organic whole, and it is impossible to do without the labor of any part. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said during his inspection in Henan: "Taking care of children should be more important than taking care of tractors and water pumps." If tractors and water pumps are not well managed, it is of course not good, it will affect people's production; if children are not well managed, if cooking is not done well, and if other service work is not done well, it will affect people's emotions, people's health, and the growth of the next generation. All of these show that comrades engaged in service work should link their work with the development of production, the improvement of life, the consolidation of the people's communes, and the construction of socialism and communism, and conscientiously and actively do it well.

    Some people say: service work is very simple, it is just cooking, coaxing children, taking care of the elderly, and cannot produce any "results," has no future, and can only be done by old women, and young people are not suitable for these jobs. This view is also wrong. We should clarify what personal prospects are. In old China, due to the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, the entire country had no future, and of course, there would be no personal prospects. In new China, the situation is completely different. Our country and people have great hope and great prospects. The country is composed of each of us, and each of us of course also has great hope and prospects. Here, the key does not depend on what work a person does, but on what attitude he takes towards the cause of the collective. If a person is a person of lofty ideals, has a firm idea of serving the people, and always consistently strives to do his job well and makes due contributions to the country and the people, then no matter what work he does, whether it is the work of a steelworker or the work of a cook, he will be respected by the Party, the country, and the people, and enjoy certain honors, and his future will be infinitely bright. The reason why some comrades engaged in service work believe that service work has no future is, one of the important reasons is that they do not consider their personal future in connection with the future of the country and the collective, but think too much from the motive of individualism. Of course, it is not right to consider the issue of personal prospects in this way.

    Is service work simple? We say it is both simple and not simple. It is simple because it is relatively easy for a cook to simply satisfy the need to cook food, and for a nursery worker to simply satisfy the need to coax children. However, if a cook is not satisfied with simply cooking food, but wants to make it delicious, nutritious, clean, and hygienic, and make the people who eat it feel satisfied and convenient; if a nursery worker is not satisfied with simply coaxing children, but wants to make the children physically and mentally healthy and become excellent successors to communism; ... this is not simple at all, it requires a lot of thought and hard work. In fact, not only service work, but any work is the same, the key lies in what attitude a person takes towards his work. If a person loves his work very much and regards it as his lifelong career, he will develop a strong interest in his work, he will find that there are many things in his work that are worth improving, and therefore he will painstakingly study and research, gradually become an expert in this field, and make outstanding contributions to the cause of the people. There are such examples in the field of service work. Many childcare workers have created and summarized a whole set of childcare work experience. The children they teach and raise are physically and mentally healthy, lively, and very polite. At the National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Congress and the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Congress held not long ago, there were many representatives of outstanding cooks, childcare workers, and other service personnel. Their model deeds are an encouragement and education to us. All comrades engaged in service work should take them as examples, learn from them, and constantly improve their political and ideological awareness and professional level, and make greater contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    服务性的工作是崇高的工作
    林准
    农村集体生活福利事业的发展，需要有很多人来从事这项工作。现在农村中已经有许多党、团员和积极分子愉快地走上了这个岗位，担任了炊事员、保育员和其他服务性的工作。社会上对他们的劳动应该怎样认识呢？炊事员、保育员和其他服务人员自己应该怎样来看待这些工作呢？这些工作是崇高，还是“下贱”？是有出息的事还是没出息的事？这是目前极需解决的一个认识问题。
    我们认为从事服务性的工作是崇高的，绝不是“下贱”的。我们有许多在公共食堂工作的同志，起早睡晚，苦心钻研，做出各种各样的饭菜，使大家吃得饱、吃得好，吃得干净卫生，对于老人、小孩、病人、产妇，还精心特意为他们预备适口的饭菜，甚至送饭上门，这难道不是崇高的工作吗？在托儿所、幼儿园工作的同志把别人的孩子当作自己的孩子一样抚养和照顾，使孩子们生活得好，教育得好，解除孩子们的爸爸和妈妈的牵累，使他们安心生产，安心工作，这难道不是崇高的工作吗？关心老人的冷暖，体贴老人的心情，使无依无靠的老人舒适愉快地度过他们的晚年，这难道不也是崇高的工作吗？但是，现在社会上仍然有一部分人甚至有些从事服务性工作的同志，对这种工作的意义还认识不足，认为这些工作是低人一等的工作。这种想法是受了旧社会的影响。在旧社会里，在剥削者看来，所有的劳动人民，当然也包括那些所谓“侍候人”的人在内，都是“低贱”的，只有他们不劳而获受人侍候的人才算是“高贵”的。这种关系是剥削者和被剥削者的关系。这种侍候人的工作确实被人看作是低人一等和下贱的。但是人们为了生存，还不得不从事这种工作，因而造成人们不愿意从事这种工作、贱视这种工作的心理，是极自然的。在今天的社会里，剥削阶级已被彻底摧垮，人和人的关系已经根本改变，社会上已经没有剥削者与被剥削者的分工，只有劳动的分工，在人民内部来说每个人的劳动都是为人民服务，也可以说都是“侍候人”。我在这个事情上“侍候”了你，你在那个事情上又“侍候”了我，专门受人“侍候”的人是没有的。反过来，不受任何人“侍候”的人也是没有的。这便是新社会中人们之间的新型关系，也是新社会中个人同集体同社会的正常关系。
    绝不能把炊事员、保育员和其他服务人员的工作看作无足轻重的小事，它们是建设社会主义和共产主义不可缺少的重要工作。吃饭、教养孩子、照顾老人，这是每个家庭和每个人都关心的事情，还在一家一户为生活单位的时候，这些工作就不能忽视。我们党向来重视人们的家务劳动，反对轻视家务劳动的不良思想倾向。今天人们已经不再以一家一户为生活单位，而是一乡一社变成了一个大家庭，作好这个大家庭的诸如吃饭、穿衣、带孩子等工作就更加重要。因为在一家一户为生活单位的时候，一个家庭的家务劳动作得不好，影响只及于一个家庭；家务劳动社会化以后，任何一个食堂、托儿所和敬老院办得不好，就会影响几十个以至几百个家庭，影响几百人以至上千人的生活。我们都知道，生产和生活是紧密地联系在一起的。只有把人们的生活照料好了，他们才能精神饱满地、毫无牵挂地从事生产和劳动。而人们一心一意地从事劳动生产，最终的目的又是为了不断改善生活，使日子过得一天比一天幸福美满。在发展生产的基础上不断改善人们的物质和文化生活，这是我们社会主义社会的基本经济法则。为了使生产能够不断的发展，社会需要有各种不同的分工。有人从事工农业劳动，直接为社会创造物质财富，他们的劳动无疑地是光荣的。而另一些人，如炊事员、保育员和其他服务人员，他们的劳动虽然不直接为社会创造物质财富，但是如果没有他们的劳动，就会影响前一部分人的劳动，也就是会影响物质财富的生产。因此，怎能说前一部分人的工作就重要、就光荣，而后一部分人的工作就不重要、不光荣呢？要知道，社会是一个有机的整体，缺少了哪一部分人的劳动都是不行的。刘少奇同志在河南视察时说过：“管孩子应当比管拖拉机、抽水机更重要。”拖拉机抽水机管不好，这当然不好，会影响人的生产；孩子管不好，做饭做不好，以及其他服务工作作不好，则会影响人的情绪、影响人的健康，影响后一代的成长。这些都说明，从事服务性工作的同志，应当把自己的工作同发展生产、改善生活联系起来，同巩固人民公社的工作联系起来，同建设社会主义和共产主义联系起来，认真地、积极地把它作好。
    有人说：服务性工作很简单，不过是做做饭，哄哄孩子，照顾老人，搞不出什么“名堂”，没有什么前途，只能叫婆婆妈妈去做，青年人不适合做这些工作。这个看法也是错误的。应该弄清楚什么是个人的前途。在旧中国，由于帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫和剥削，整个国家都没有前途，当然也就不会有个人的前途。在新中国，情况就完全不同，我们的国家和人民是大有希望，大有前途的。国家是由我们每一个人共同组成的，我们每一个人当然也是大有希望和前途。这里，问题的关键不决定于一个人作什么工作，而是要看他对集体的事业采取什么态度。一个人如果是志趣高尚的人，有坚定的为人民服务的思想，并且总是一贯地努力做好自己的工作，对国家和人民作出应有的贡献，那就不管他作的是什么工作，是炼钢工人的工作或者炊事员的工作，他都会受到党、国家和人民的尊重，而享有一定的荣誉，他的前途就是无限美好的。有些从事服务性工作的同志，所以认为服务性工作没有前途，重要的原因之一，就是他们不是把个人的前途和国家的、集体的前途联系起来考虑，而是过多地从个人主义的动机出发。这样来考虑个人的前途问题当然是不对的。
    服务性工作是不是简单呢？我们说是又简单又不简单。说它简单，是因为一个炊事员如果仅仅满足于把饭菜作熟，一个保育员仅仅满足于哄哄孩子，……这是比较容易作到的。但是，如果炊事员不满足于仅仅把饭菜作熟，而且要作得味美适口、富于营养、清洁卫生，使用饭的人感到满意和方便；如果保育员不满足于仅仅哄哄孩子，而且要使孩子的身心健康，成为优秀的共产主义接班人；……这就很不简单，需要多动脑筋，需要付出辛勤的劳动。其实，不只服务性工作，任何工作都是一样，问题的关键就在于人对自己的工作采取什么态度。如果一个人十分热爱自己的工作，把它看作自己的终身事业，他就会对自己的工作产生浓厚的兴趣，就会发现自己的工作还有许多值得改进的地方，因而苦心学习和钻研，逐渐成为这方面的专家，对人民的事业作出优异的贡献。在服务性工作方面，就有这样的例子，有许多保育人员已经创造和总结了一整套托儿工作的经验，在她们教养下的孩子，一个个身心健康，性情活泼，很有礼貌。在前不久召开的全国妇女建设社会主义积极分子代表会议和全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会中，就有许多代表是代表的炊事员、保育员和其他服务优秀人员。他（她）们的模范事迹，对我们是一种鼓舞，也是一种教育。所有从事服务性工作的同志都应该以他（她）们为榜样，向他（她）们学习，不断地提高自己的政治思想觉悟和业务水平，为祖国的社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。
