Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 17th: TASS Moscow, February 17th: Soviet Foreign Trade Minister Patolichev said to a "Pravda" reporter that U.S. Undersecretary of State Dillon's January 27th speech in New Orleans on the issue of trade and economic relations between the Soviet Union and the United States contained the spirit of the Cold War.

Patolichev pointed out that Dillon's speech was an attempt to pour cold water on American business circles. Because recently, especially after Mikoyan's visit to the United States, American business circles have shown increasing interest in the normalization of Soviet-American trade and the development of Soviet-American trade. Dillon's speech apparently also aimed to evade the criticism of the U.S. State Department by the broad American public and to defend the delayed response to Khrushchev's specific proposals in his letter to U.S. President Eisenhower last summer regarding the development of trade between the Soviet Union and the United States.

"Pravda" published Patolichev's speech today.

Patolichev said that the Soviet Union has put forward constructive suggestions for the development of economic ties between the Soviet Union and the United States. However, the current U.S. government is unwilling to normalize trade relations between the two countries, and the political motives behind the U.S. government's attitude towards this matter cannot be concealed. Dillon's speech in New Orleans reflected this situation. Like other American leaders, in order to justify this negative attitude, he constantly resorted to various fabrications, attempting to shift the blame for the abnormal relationship onto the Soviet Union. Dillon not only tried to pour cold water on the desire of American businessmen to develop US-Soviet trade, but also tried to scare them with a "communist" threat that did not exist.

Patolichev said that there is no need to argue in a "Cold War" manner now, because this will hinder the search for realistic ways to solve the problem of developing Soviet-American trade. Both sides should find mutually acceptable solutions to this problem.

When talking about the state of Soviet-American trade and the possibility of developing trade, Patolichev reminded that Khrushchev had specifically pointed out the possible ways to develop Soviet-American trade and economic relations in his letter to Eisenhower last summer. These ways include the Soviet Union purchasing billions of dollars worth of industrial equipment and other commodities from the United States in the recent years, expanding the export of Soviet goods to the United States, and establishing a normal contractual legal basis.

Patolichev pointed out that the current trade volume between the Soviet Union and the United States is very limited. We believe that this situation is abnormal, but it does not depend on the Soviet Union. The United States unilaterally abolished the trade agreement of 1937, and the U.S. authorities' bans and restrictions on the export of goods from the United States to the Soviet Union, as well as discriminatory measures against the export of Soviet goods to the United States, are all caused by the "Cold War" policy implemented by the U.S. government.

Patolichev said that in addition to direct bans, American companies have to obtain special permits to export many goods to the Soviet Union. Although it is not ostensibly prohibited to export from the United States, the U.S. authorities actually use this method to prohibit the export of these goods, and Dillon deliberately avoids talking about this. In the United States, a psychologically unfavorable situation is created for those companies that want to trade with the Soviet Union. Patolichev said that reality itself proves that all obstacles must be eliminated in order to clear the way for mutually beneficial trade between the two countries.

Dillon insisted that Soviet foreign trade was "unstable" and that the Soviet Union seemed to intend to develop its economy "in a state of isolation in foreign trade." When talking about this, Patolichev pointed out that from 1950 to 1958, the Soviet Union's trade volume with foreign countries increased by 1.6 times, and the Soviet Union's trade volume with capitalist countries increased from 2.5 billion rubles in 1950 to 9 billion rubles in 1958. Now, the Soviet Union trades with more than 70 countries, while in 1946 it only traded with 40 countries.

Patolichev said that Dillon arbitrarily said that the Soviet Union's export structure is very different from that of industrialized capitalist countries. The reason why he said this is obviously to portray the Soviet Union as a competitor to economically underdeveloped countries, in an attempt to cause conflict between the Soviet Union and these countries. The Soviet Union's export structure, like its import structure, is so broad and diversified that it can actually establish mutually beneficial commodity exchange relations with any country without harming any other country.

Patolichev pointed out that Dillon's assertion that the Soviet Union seems to be relying heavily on obtaining machinery and equipment from Western countries in implementing the Seven-Year Plan is unfounded. Patolichev said that the Soviet Seven-Year Plan relies on the solid foundation of the Soviet state's internal resources. If the ruling groups of some Western countries believe that the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan and the further technological progress of the Soviet Union depend on trade with them and on the purchase of equipment from abroad, then they are very wrong. Patolichev also said that the Seven-Year Plan does not stipulate obtaining loans from foreign countries, and the Soviet Union can complete and over fulfill the Seven-Year Plan without U.S. loans.

Patolichev said that Dillon's statement that the Soviet Union intends to "plunder economically underdeveloped countries through trade and aid" is unfounded. Facts show that cooperation between economically underdeveloped countries and the Soviet Union helps the development of these countries' national economies.

Patolichev said that we do not impose aid, economic cooperation and trade on others, but hope to develop trade and economic relations with those Asian, African and Latin American countries that are willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union.

If the Soviet Union is "attacking", it is better to say that the Soviet Union supports the Asian, African and Latin American countries' attack on the economic backwardness and poverty left to these countries by colonialism. Patolichev emphasized that we have stated more than once that we are prepared to compete with the United States in this regard. He pointed out that the Soviet Union's assistance in building the Bhilai steel plant in India, as well as the Soviet Union's cooperation with the United Arab Republic in implementing the UAR's economic development plan and building the Aswan Dam, are examples of effective cooperation.

    苏联对外贸易部长帕托利切夫发表谈话
    苏美贸易情况不正常咎在美国  
    狄龙竭力想给美国实业界人士的愿望泼冷水
  新华社17日讯据塔斯社莫斯科17日讯：苏联对外贸易部长帕托利切夫向“真理报”记者发表谈话说，美国副国务卿狄龙1月27日在新奥尔良就苏美两国的贸易经济关系问题发表的谈话中包含着冷战精神。
    帕托利切夫指出，狄龙的谈话是想给美国实业界人士泼冷水。因为最近，特别是米高扬访美之后，美国实业界人士对苏美贸易正常化和发展苏美贸易的问题表现出越来越大的兴趣。狄龙的谈话显然还抱着这样的目的，就是企图逃避美国广大公众对美国国务院的指责，企图为迟迟不就赫鲁晓夫去年夏天给美国总统艾森豪威尔的信中提出的关于发展苏美两国贸易问题的具体建议向苏联政府作出答复的这种做法作辩护。
      “真理报”今天发表了帕托利切夫的这篇谈话。
    帕托利切夫说，苏联在发展苏美两国的经济联系方面提出了建设性建议，然而目前美国政府还不愿意使两国的贸易关系正常化，美国政府对这件事采取这种态度的政治动机是掩饰不住的。狄龙在新奥尔良的演说反映了这种情况。他同美国其他领导人一样为了给否定态度辩解，不时采用各种臆造，企图把关系不正常的过错转嫁给苏联。狄龙不仅企图给美国商人发展美苏贸易的愿望泼冷水，而且还用根本不存在的“共产主义”威胁来吓唬他们。
    帕托利切夫说，现在不需要用“冷战”方式来争论，因为这会妨碍找寻现实的办法来解决发展苏美贸易的问题。双方应当找出彼此可以接受的解决这个问题的办法。
    谈到苏美贸易状况和发展贸易的可能性时，帕托利切夫提醒注意：在赫鲁晓夫去年夏天给艾森豪威尔的信中，已经具体地指出了发展苏美贸易经济关系的可能途径，这些途径包括苏联可以在最近几年内向美国购买几十亿美元的工业设备和其他商品，扩大苏联商品对美国的输出，建立正常的合同法律基础。
    帕托利切夫指出，目前苏美两国的贸易额很有限。我们认为，这种情况是不正常的，但是它不取决于苏联。美国单方面废除1937年的贸易协定，以及美国当局对美国向苏联输出商品所采取的禁令和限制，对苏联向美国输出商品的歧视措施，都是由于美国政府执行的“冷战”政策所造成的。
    帕托利切夫说，除直接的禁令外，美国公司向苏联出口许多商品都要获得特许，虽然表面上不禁止从美国输出，但实际上美国当局用这种办法来禁止输出这些商品，而狄龙对这一点故意避而不谈。在美国，对那些希望同苏联进行贸易的公司在心理上就造成一种不利的状态。帕托利切夫说，现实生活本身证明，必须消除一切障碍，以便为两国的互利贸易扫清道路。
    狄龙硬说什么苏联对外贸易“不稳定”，说苏联似乎打算“在对外贸易上孤立的情况下”发展自己的经济。帕托利切夫谈到这一点时指出，从1950年到1958年，苏联同外国的贸易额增加了一点六倍，苏联同资本主义国家的贸易额从1950年的二十五亿卢布增加到1958年的九十亿卢布。现在，苏联同七十多个国家进行贸易，而1946年只同四十个国家进行贸易。
    帕托利切夫说，狄龙武断地说，苏联的出口结构同工业发达的资本主义国家的出口结构大不相同。他所以要这样说，显然是为了把苏联描绘成对经济不发达国家的竞争国，企图使苏联同这些国家发生冲突。苏联出口结构同进口一样，是这样的广泛和多样化，这使得它实际上能够在不损害任何其他国家的情况下同任何一个国家建立互利的商品交换关系。
    帕托利切夫指出，狄龙硬说苏联在执行七年计划时在很大程度上似乎要指靠获得西方国家的机器和设备，这种说法是没有根据的。帕托利切夫说，苏联七年计划依靠的是苏维埃国家内部资源的坚固基础。如果某些西方国家的统治集团认为七年计划的执行和苏联的进一步的技术进步要靠同它们的贸易，要靠向国外购买设备，那他们就大错特错了。帕托利切夫还说，七年计划没有规定向外国取得贷款，苏联能够不要美国的贷款而完成和超额完成七年计划。
    帕托利切夫说，狄龙说苏联打算“通过贸易和援助的办法掠夺经济上不发达的国家”，这种说法是没有任何根据的。事实表明，经济上不发达的国家同苏联进行合作，有助于这些国家的民族经济的发展。
    帕托利切夫说，我们并不把援助、经济合作和贸易强加给别人，而是希望发展同那些愿意跟苏联合作的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的贸易经济关系。
    如果说苏联“进攻”，那么不如说是苏联支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国对殖民主义遗留给这些国家的经济落后和贫困进行进攻。帕托利切夫强调指出，我们不止一次地声明，我们准备在这方面同美国竞赛。他指出，苏联帮助印度建设比莱钢铁厂，以及苏联同阿拉伯联合共和国在实现阿联的经济发展计划和建筑阿斯旺水坝方面进行合作，就是有成效的合作的例证。
