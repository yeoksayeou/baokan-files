Double Attack with Water and Fertilizer to Overcome the Wheat Regreening Stage
Henan Launches a Watering Campaign Centered on Manure Accumulation
Shaanxi Establishes Institutions to Impart Technology and Strengthen Spring Irrigation

(Our Newspaper Zhengzhou, February 17th) Henan Province has decided to vigorously launch a watering campaign centered on manure accumulation and fertilizer production for regreening wheat. Since the Party Central Committee put forward the call for "Fertilizer in Command," the province has set off a mass upsurge of manure accumulation and fertilizer production by the whole people. In the twenty-odd days from late last month to now, the province has accumulated more than 2.2 trillion jin of fertilizer. Adding this to the winter accumulation, the province has accumulated a total of 6 trillion jin of fertilizer, more than ten times the amount in the same period last year. At present, more than 90% of wheat fields have been top-dressed once or more, and more than 60% of wheat fields have been top-dressed twice or more.

Now that the wheat is about to regreen, it is necessary to supply sufficient moisture. Since there has been little rain and snow since last winter, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that it is now necessary to combine water conservancy and manure accumulation into one force, and launch a mass campaign to irrigate regreening water, ensuring that wheat can "drink its fill" after "eating its fill."

The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a telephone conference of first secretaries of prefectural and municipal party committees. It demanded that party committees at all levels, with the same enthusiasm as running iron and steel production, the first secretaries taking the lead, the whole party and the whole people mobilized, work hard day and night in shifts with the spirit of hard struggle for twenty days, universally irrigate wheat regreening water, and ensure that yields are doubled compared to last year.

The conference required members of party committees at all levels to take responsibility for specific areas, establish a responsibility system, and be responsible to the end. Each special district, county, and commune should organize a command headquarters, with the commissioner, county head, and commune director serving as commanders. Wheat regreening water should be thoroughly and evenly irrigated, generally about 50 cubic meters of water per mu of wheat field. In old irrigated areas with irrigation foundations and watering habits, not only must the irrigation be completed, but the irrigation quality must also be improved; in new irrigated areas, especially in areas where many finishing projects have not been completed, it is necessary to simultaneously grasp the projects and irrigation; in mountainous and hilly areas where water sources are scarce, it is necessary to adopt the method of spot watering with a mixture of water and human manure, requiring universal spot watering once; in areas where there has been recent rainfall to saturate the soil and wheat fields are not lacking moisture, it is necessary to continue to vigorously engage in manure accumulation, fertilizer production, and top-dressing, and at the same time actively prepare for irrigation work.

The conference also required all localities to first explain to the vast number of cadres and masses the important significance of irrigating wheat regreening water this year, and at the same time conduct inspection work: if water sources are insufficient, actively expand water sources; inspect water conservancy projects, and immediately repair any projects that cannot currently exert their effectiveness and complete projects with finishing work within a time limit; inspect tools, and if water lifting tools are insufficient, counties and communes should establish repair and distribution factories, immediately repair damaged tools, and at the same time mass-produce simple water lifting tools, so that every well and pond has water lifting tools. In order to ensure timely irrigation, the province is required to mobilize ten million people to participate in the wheat watering campaign, and organize large-scale collaboration between communes and between regions.

(Our Newspaper Xian, February 17th) Shaanxi Province, closely following winter irrigation, is launching spring irrigation to ensure a bumper harvest of summer crops and timely sowing of early autumn crops such as cotton. At present, the spring irrigation in the two special districts of Ankang and Hanzhong in southern Shaanxi and the Guanzhong area has been fully launched. Small canals in various counties are releasing water for spring irrigation one after another. The large Luo Hui Canal, after completing canal renovation, began releasing water on the 11th. The Jing Hui Canal and the Wei Hui Canal are also rushing to renovate the canals and will soon release water for spring irrigation.

Shaanxi Province has carried out a series of preparatory work in grasping spring irrigation. According to the water needs of crops, the province has determined this year's spring irrigation task to be a total of 18 million mu, of which 13 million mu are for wheat. Based on the situation that water conservancy has greatly developed this year but there has been no spring irrigation habit and lack of experience in the past, various localities have conducted discussions and debates at cadre meetings and canal irrigation committee meetings to unify ideological understanding; secondly, various localities have established and improved organizational structures for irrigation water use before spring irrigation, and various communes have also organized professional irrigation teams to support each other in night shift irrigation. Many places have also held irrigation training classes, organizing new irrigation areas to learn experience from old irrigation areas. They have rushed to repair water lifting tools and canals to ensure the smooth progress of spring irrigation.

Various localities have also studied the timing, methods, and water usage of spring irrigation. According to the fact that early irrigation of wheat yields more than late irrigation in the past and predicting future rainfall conditions, the Guanzhong area will generally combine fertilization with spring irrigation three to four times during the regreening, jointing, heading, and filling stages; in the arid and colder areas of northern Shaanxi, it has been decided to irrigate six times from March to June; in high-yield fields and hillside areas, advanced methods such as sprinkler irrigation and underground irrigation have also been promoted.

Various localities have also paid close attention to exerting the potential of irrigation facilities, rationally using water, and saving water in arranging spring irrigation. The current outstanding problem is that water sources are felt to be insufficient. Therefore, in areas with dual equipment such as canal and well combinations, in addition to rationally utilizing river water, it is also necessary to fully utilize groundwater; in areas with water storage conditions, it is advocated to store water as it is irrigated.

    水肥双攻小麦返青关
    河南以积肥为中心开展浇水运动
    陕西建立机构传授技术加强春灌
    本报郑州17日电　河南省决定大力开展以积肥造肥为中心的浇小麦返青水运动。自党中央提出“肥料挂帅”的号召后，全省掀起了群众性的全民积肥造肥高潮，仅在上月下旬到现在的二十多天里，全省共积肥二万二千多亿斤，加上冬季积肥，全省共积肥六万亿斤，相当去年同期的十倍多。目前90％以上麦田都已施了一次以上的追肥，其中60％多的麦田施追肥两次以上。
    现在小麦即将返青，必需供应充足的水分。去年入冬以来由于雨雪稀少，中共河南省委认为，目前必须把水利和积肥拧成一股绳，突击开展群众性的大浇返青水运动，保证小麦在“吃饱”以后，能够“喝足”。
    中共河南省委最近召开了地、市委第一书记电话会议。要求各级党委以大办钢铁的劲头，第一书记上马，全党全民齐出动，日夜轮番苦战的精神大干苦干二十天，普浇小麦返青水，保证产量比去年翻一番。
    会议要求各级党委委员分片包干，建立责任制，一包到底；各专、县、社都要组织指挥部，由专员、县长、社长任指挥。小麦返青水要浇透浇匀，一般麦田每亩浇水五十公方左右。在有灌溉基础、浇地习惯的老灌区，不但要浇完，而且要提高灌溉质量；对新灌区，特别是在很多结尾工程未做完的地区，要一面抓工程，一面抓灌溉；山区、丘陵区水源缺少的地方，要采取水和人粪尿混合点浇的方法，要求普遍点浇一遍；最近落透墒雨和麦田不缺墒的地区，要继续大搞积肥、造肥、追肥，并同时积极作好灌溉准备工作。
    会议还要求各地首先对广大干部和群众讲明今年大浇小麦返青水的重要意义，同时要进行检查工作：如水源不足，要积极扩大水源；要检查水利工程，凡目前不能发挥效益的工程，需要修理的马上修理，有尾工的限期做完；要检查工具，凡提水工具不足的，各县、社要建立修配厂，工具损坏了的立即修理，同时大量制造简易提水工具，达到井井塘塘有提水工具。为了保证适时浇灌，要求全省动员一千万人投入浇麦运动，组织社与社、地区与地区之间的大协作。　（周君谦）
    本报西安17日电　陕西省紧接冬灌之后，展开春灌以保证夏田作物丰收和棉田等早秋作物适时播种。目前陕南的安康、汉中两个专区和关中地区的春灌已经全面展开。各县小型渠道都在陆续放水春灌。大型的洛惠渠在完成渠道整修之后，在11日已开始放水。泾惠渠、渭惠渠也正在突击整修渠道、马上就要放水春灌。
    陕西省在抓春灌中曾进行了一系列的准备工作。各地根据农作物需水情况，确定今年春灌任务共一千八百万亩，其中小麦一千三百万亩。各地根据今年水利大发展而过去又没有春灌习惯和缺乏经验的情况，在各级干部会议和渠系灌溉委员会议上，进行鸣放辩论统一思想认识；其次，各地在春灌前都建立与健全了灌溉用水的组织机构，各个公社还组织专业浇灌队，互相支援连夜轮班灌溉。很多地方还举办灌溉训练班，组织新灌区到老灌区学习经验。突击整修了提水工具和渠道，以保证春灌顺利进行。
    各地还研究了春灌的时间、方法及用水量等问题。根据过去小麦早灌比晚灌增产以及预测今后雨量情况，关中地区一般渠道要在返青、拔节、抽穗、灌浆结合施肥春灌三至四次；气候干旱而较冷的陕北地区，决定从3月到6月灌水六次；在高产田及山坡地区还推广了喷灌和地下灌等先进办法。
    各地在布置春灌中还十分注意了发挥灌溉设施潜力，合理用水和节约用水。目前突出的问题是水源感到不足，因此在有渠井结合等双套设备地区，除合理利用河水外，还要充分利用地下水；在有蓄水条件的地区，提倡随灌随蓄。（附图片）
