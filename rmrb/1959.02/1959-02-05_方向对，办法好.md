In the unprecedented Great Leap Forward of industrial and agricultural production in 1958, the production and supply of daily-use industrial products also greatly increased. With the even greater leap forward in production and construction in 1959 and the realization of people's communes, there is no doubt that social purchasing power will continue to grow, which is a sign of our country's economic prosperity. In order to meet the increase in people's purchasing power, light industry must have a greater development. From the current point of view, we should do everything possible to tap the production potential of daily-use industrial products, actively increase the supply of goods, and expand the supply of daily-use industrial products. This is very important for meeting the people's needs for daily-use industrial products and promoting a greater leap forward in this year's production.

From the perspective of commercial departments, the prerequisite for doing a good job in the supply of daily-use industrial products is to first control the source of goods. How can commercial departments better control the source of goods and meet the consumption needs of the people? The direction of the Guangxi commercial departments in implementing the "facing the local, organizing production" and actively assisting the local industrial departments in producing daily-use industrial products published in this newspaper today is correct. The Chongqing commercial departments assisting medium and small cities in running industries is also a very good method. The characteristics of their work are looking downward, self-reliance, starting from organizing production, and actively assisting local industrial departments in formulating plans and arranging production according to the needs of the local market: which kind of goods are needed in the market, they organize local industrial departments to produce which kind of goods, and what is lacking, they organize to produce what. Not only that, they also exerted the role of the commercial departments as having "long legs, wide eyes, and sensitive ears," and did everything possible to assist local industrial departments in solving various problems encountered in the production process, such as helping production departments to tap local resources and find substitute raw materials, and actively helping production departments solve technical problems, so that the production of local industries could proceed smoothly. In a word: through commercial work, on the premise of first doing a good job in commodity circulation, they embodied the production point of view, and played the role of "General Staff" and "Logistics Department" for the production of industrial departments, greatly strengthened the cooperation between industry and commerce.

The Guangxi and other places' commercial departments' implementation of the principle of "facing the local, organizing production" has also been very effective: it has greatly increased the source of goods, expanded market supply, and rapidly promoted the growth and development of local industries, and laid a solid and reliable foundation for further controlling the source of daily-use industrial products and expanding market supply in the future.

Perhaps some people think that since production determines distribution, exchange, and consumption, then the attitude of commercial departments is to "reach up," asking the higher authorities to allocate goods. If the allocation cannot be made, they turn to "look outward," sending a large number of people to purchase in large and medium-sized cities, thinking that this is the only way out. This idea is of course wrong. The fundamental task of commercial departments is of course to do a good job in commodity circulation, but commercial work is not entirely passive. To truly embody the role of the link between production and consumption, commerce should, within its own functional scope, reflect the market situation to the production departments and actively organize production according to market needs. Only in this way can we both promote production and meet consumption needs. The advantage of the Guangxi and Chongqing commercial departments' approach lies in this.

    方向对，办法好
    在1958年的工农业生产的空前大跃进中，日用工业品的生产和供应也都有很大的增长。随着1959年生产建设的更大跃进和人民公社化的实现，毫无疑问，社会购买力还会继续增长，这是我们国家经济繁荣的标志。为了适应人民购买力的增加，轻工业必须要有一个较大的发展。从当前来说，则应千方百计挖掘日用工业品的生产潜力，积极增加货源，以扩大日用工业品的供应，这对于满足人民对日用工业品的需要，和促进今年生产的更大跃进，都是十分重要的工作。
    从商业部门来说，做好日用工业品供应的前提首先要掌握商品货源。商业部门怎样才能更好地掌握商品货源，满足人民的消费需要呢？今天本报发表的广西商业部门贯彻“面向地方，组织生产”积极协助地方工业部门生产日用工业品的方向是对的。重庆市商业部门协助中、小城市办工业也是一个很好的办法。它们工作的特点是眼睛向下，自力更生，从组织生产入手，根据当地市场的需要积极地协助地方工业部门制定规划，安排生产：市场需要哪种商品，就组织地方工业部门生产哪种商品，缺少什么就组织生产什么。不仅如此，他们还发挥了商业部门“腿长、眼宽、耳灵”的作用，千方百计地协助地方工业部门解决生产过程中遇到的各种问题，如帮助生产部门挖掘地方资源、找代用原料，积极帮助生产部门解决技术问题，使地方工业的生产得以顺利进行。一句话：它们通过商业工作，在首先做好商品流通的前提下，体现了生产观点，对工业部门的生产既发挥了“参谋部”的作用，又发挥了“后勤部”的作用，大大地密切了工商协作关系。
    广西等地商业部门贯彻“面向地方　组织生产”的方针，效果也十分显著：既大大增加了商品货源，扩大了市场供应，又迅速地促进了地方工业的成长和发展，并为今后进一步掌握日用工业品的货源，扩大市场供应打下了稳固可靠的基础。
    也许有人以为既然生产是决定分配、交换和消费的，那末商业部门的态度就是“伸手向上”，要求上级调拨。调拨不来，就转而“眼睛向外”，派出大批人员到大、中城市采购。以为这才是出路。这种想法当然是不对的。商业部门的根本任务，当然是作好商品流通，但商业工作也并不完全是被动的，商业要真正体现生产和消费之间的纽带作用，就应当在自己的职能范围以内，根据市场需要，向生产部门反映市场情况，主动组织生产。这样才能既督促了生产，又满足了消费需要。广西和重庆市商业部门的作法的好处就在这里。
