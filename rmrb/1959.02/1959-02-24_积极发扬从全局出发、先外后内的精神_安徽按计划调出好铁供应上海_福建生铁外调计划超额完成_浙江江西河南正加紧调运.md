Actively Promote the Spirit of Considering the Overall Situation, Prioritizing External Needs Over Internal Ones
Anhui Transfers Good Iron to Supply Shanghai According to Plan
Fujian Exceeds its Pig Iron Outward Transfer Plan; Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Henan are Speeding Up Transfers

(Our Newspaper Hefei, 23rd dispatch) Anhui Province actively implements the principle of "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard," regarding the task of transferring pig iron to support important enterprises in Shanghai and other places as one of the most important tasks of the province's metallurgical industry. As of February 19th, the province had transferred more than 105,000 tons of pig iron in over a month, equivalent to 26% of the total transfer volume of the past year. More than 88% of the iron produced in January was transferred to support Shanghai.

In order to implement the Central Committee's principle of "The Whole Country as a Single Chessboard," the Anhui Provincial Party Committee proposed that the province's use of pig iron must be subordinate to the outward transfer tasks, and the transferred iron must be of good quality. The Wuhu Prefectural Committee stipulated that any unit wanting to use even one ton of iron for its own purposes must obtain approval from the Prefectural Committee in order to ensure the timely completion of the iron transfer task. In addition, the industrial secretaries of the provincial, prefectural, and municipal Party committees personally directed the iron transfer work. All the iron transferred from the province is of good quality, meeting the requirements for steelmaking and casting.

In order to implement the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee on iron transfer, all parts of the province have tried every means to overcome transportation difficulties and transfer iron to support Shanghai. In the Dabie Mountains, where roads are rugged and difficult to travel, workers carried iron, crossed mountains and ridges, and conducted relay transportation in batches and stations. The Highway Bureau stipulated that returning trucks transporting ore and coke to support blast furnace production must bring iron back to the station. The Changjiang Shipping Bureau mostly used special ships to send iron to Shanghai. The Railway Bureau, in the case of insufficient freight cars, proposed "as long as there is iron, draw freight cars," to ensure timely shipment. When the Hefei Railway Station dismantled the tracks, the original seventeen cargo spaces for iron were reduced to five, but the station stevedores and dispatchers worked together to adopt double-layered cargo spaces and frequent delivery of freight cars to ensure that the daily transfer volume of iron was not reduced during the dismantling of the tracks. Recently, Anhui has had continuous spring rain, which has greatly affected the iron transfer, but the transfer work is still continuing. The Commissioner of Fuyang Prefecture and the Director of the Metallurgical Bureau personally participated in the loading and unloading work in the heavy rain, and fought hard for four days and four nights with eight hundred iron-transporting warriors, carrying thousands of tons of iron onto ships and transferring them to Bengbu Station to support Shanghai.

(Our Newspaper Shanghai, 23rd dispatch) This reporter learned from relevant departments in Shanghai that recently Anhui, Fujian, and other provinces and cities are making every effort to transfer large quantities of good iron according to the national plan, actively supporting Shanghai's steel industry production.

After completing the January transfer plan, Anhui Province has taken various measures since February to organize the masses to carry out rush transportation, timely supplying Shanghai's needs. The pig iron suitable for making good steel accounts for more than 90%. Recently, the Provincial Metallurgical Industry Department also issued a special instruction, arranging for each prefecture to transport 5,300 tons of pig iron daily to supply Shanghai's needs. Ma'anshan, Hefei, and other places have also mobilized employees and office cadres to carry out rush loading and unloading to ensure the completion of tasks.

The people of Fujian Province have shown great enthusiasm in supporting Shanghai's steel industry, overcoming many difficulties to transport pig iron from the mountains. In January, the province produced a total of 8,000 tons of pig iron, of which more than 6,000 tons were transferred to Shanghai, exceeding the task by more than 700 tons.

Benxi Iron and Steel Company also provides Shanghai with a sufficient number of good quality pig iron according to the plan.

Other provinces have also made emergency arrangements and deployments. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, at a telephone conference of the prefectural Party committee industrial secretaries held in mid-February, instructed all localities to immediately mobilize the masses, organize commando transport teams, and carry out rush transport by both land and water, requiring to ensure the completion of the February supply of pig iron to Shanghai and strive to make up for the January shortfall. Now all parts of the province have taken action according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee.

Zhejiang, Henan, and other provinces have also issued the transfer plan number to each prefecture. They are now contacting the cadres sent by Shanghai for delivery work, and they will be able to ship pig iron immediately after the contact. Zhejiang also requires all localities to support Shanghai entirely with good iron in the instructions. The Banshan Iron and Steel Plant in this province, after learning that Shanghai urgently needed ferromanganese, immediately transferred a part of its own ferromanganese for steelmaking to support Shanghai. Since January, more than 700 tons have been continuously transported. (Photo attached)

### 积极发扬从全局出发、先外后内的精神  安徽按计划调出好铁供应上海  福建生铁外调计划超额完成　浙江江西河南正加紧调运

    积极发扬从全局出发、先外后内的精神
    安徽按计划调出好铁供应上海
    福建生铁外调计划超额完成　浙江江西河南正加紧调运
    本报合肥23日电　安徽省积极执行“全国一盘棋”的方针，把调运生铁支援上海等地重要企业的任务，当作全省冶金工业的重要工作之一。截至2月19日为止，一个多月内，全省已调出生铁十万五千多吨，相当于去年全年调铁数字的26％。1月份生产的铁，有88％以上调出支援上海。
    为了贯彻中央“全国一盘棋”的方针，中共安徽省委提出，本省使用生铁必须服从外调任务，调出的铁必须是好铁。芜湖地委为了保证调铁任务及时完成，规定各单位自用一吨铁都必须经过地委批准。此外，省、地、市委工业书记都亲自指挥调铁工作。全省调出的铁都是好铁，合乎炼钢、铸造要求。
    全省各地为了执行中央和省委调铁的指示，想尽办法克服运输困难，把铁调出支援上海。大别山区道路崎岖难行，工人们抬着铁，翻山越岭，分批分站，络绎不绝地进行接力运输。公路局规定运矿石、焦炭支援高炉生产的回空汽车，必须带铁回站。长江航运局大部采用专船把铁送往上海。铁路局在车皮不够用的情况下，提出“只要有铁就抽车皮”，保证及时运出。合肥车站撤销路轨时，把原来十七个货位上铁，减少到五个货位，但车站装卸工和调度员通力协作，采取双层上货位和勤送车皮的办法，保证在撤销路轨期间，没有减少铁的日调量。近日安徽春雨绵绵，对调铁影响很大，但调运工作仍继续进行。阜阳专区专员和冶金局长在大雨中，亲自参加装卸工作，和八百名运铁战士苦战四天四夜，把千吨铁搬上船调往蚌埠站，支援上海。
    本报上海23日电　记者从上海有关部门得知，最近安徽、福建等省市正按照国家计划千方百计地调运大量好铁，积极支援上海钢铁工业生产。
    安徽省在完成1月份的调拨计划以后，2月份以来，他们又采取各种措施，组织群众进行突击抢运，及时供应上海需要，其中适宜于炼好钢的生铁占90％以上。最近，省冶金工业厅还专门发出指示，布置各专区做到日运五千三百吨生铁供应上海需要。马鞍山、合肥等地为了确保任务完成，还发动了职工和机关干部进行突击装卸。
    福建省人民在支援上海钢铁工业方面，发挥了极大热情，克服许多困难，从山区把生铁运送出来。1月份该省共生产八千吨生铁，调拨给上海的就占六千余吨，超额七百多吨完成了任务。
    本溪钢铁公司也按计划给上海提供足数的质量好的生铁。
    其他各省现在也都作了紧急安排、布置。中共江西省委在本月中旬召开的地委工业书记电话会议上，指示各地立即发动群众，组织突击运输队，进行水陆两路一齐抢运，要求保证完成2月份供应上海生铁任务，并争取将1月份缺额补足。现在全省各地已根据省委指示行动起来。
    浙江、河南等省也分别将调拨计划数下达各专区。现正与上海派去的干部联系发货工作，等接洽以后，马上就可发运生铁。浙江在指示中还要求各地完全以好铁支援上海。这个省的半山钢铁厂，在得知上海十分需要锰铁情况后，马上将自己炼钢用的锰铁，调出一部分支援上海，1月份以来，已连续运到了七百多吨。（附图片）
