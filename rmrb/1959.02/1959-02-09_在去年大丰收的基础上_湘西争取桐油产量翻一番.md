Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, February 8th: Xiangxi's golden tung oil, famous at home and abroad, has broken the convention of "one year of good harvest, one year of poor harvest" and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in 1958.

According to statistics from the Forestry Bureau of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture: In 1958, the total tung oil production of the prefecture reached 200,000 dan, an increase of 25% compared with the bumper harvest of 1957 and more than five times that of the early post-liberation period. The 14,594 mu of tung oil forests in Duanlongshan Commune, Guzhang County, produced a total of 1.81 million jin of golden tung oil in 1958, with an average yield of 124 jin per mu, a fivefold increase compared with 1957, and 810,000 jin more than the total tung oil production of the entire county in the early post-liberation period. Currently, the golden tung oil of the autonomous prefecture is being transported out of the mountainous area along the Dong River, You River, Li River, and the Hunan-Sichuan and Dayong-Cili highways to support industrial construction in various places.

The Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture is a place rich in tung oil, but before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionaries devastated and plundered the tung oil producing areas, and each dan of golden tung oil could only be exchanged for 30 jin of edible salt. As a result, hundreds of thousands of mu of tung oil in the autonomous prefecture were gradually abandoned. In the past few years since liberation, the party organizations of the autonomous prefecture have focused on both grain and mountain products, listing tung oil cultivation as one of the contents of agricultural production, which has enabled Xiangxi tung oil production to embark on a new stage of development.

The main reasons for the bumper harvest of Xiangxi tung oil in 1958 are: First, large-scale terracing. Most of the mountainous areas of the autonomous prefecture are composed of bluestone soil, which is easily eroded and lost during mountain floods. In the past few years, the people of the prefecture have generally terraced the steep slopes planted with tung trees. In this way, the water storage and soil conservation capacity of the mountains has been increased, so that the tung trees get sufficient nutrients, bear more fruit, and store more oil. Second, cultivation and weeding. Before liberation, although farmers of all ethnic groups in the prefecture had the habit of managing tung trees, the management was relatively poor. Only some areas practiced summer weeding, and generally they were "at the mercy of nature." Now, farmers of all ethnic groups generally carry out one to two cultivations and weedings for tung trees. Some areas have also begun to implement cultivation methods such as cutting the main roots to promote fibrous roots, applying fertilizer, preventing insects, and pruning branches. Third, large-scale integration of grain and forestry. This is an effective way to strengthen the management of tung trees. After people sow miscellaneous grain crops in the tung oil forests, they have to carry out soil loosening, cultivation, topdressing, and soil preparation several times a year, which is very beneficial to the growth of tung trees.

This year, the autonomous prefecture plans to double the production of tung oil on the basis of 1958, and the tung oil picking area of the prefecture this year will increase by more than 40% compared with 1958. In order to strengthen the cultivation and management of tung trees, the technical personnel at all levels of the autonomous prefecture who are in charge of tung oil production have gone deep into the mountain villages to work with farmers of all ethnic groups, cutting roots and loosening soil on the ridges and in the valleys, striving to realize this year's leap forward plan.

### 在去年大丰收的基础上  湘西争取桐油产量翻一番

    在去年大丰收的基础上
    湘西争取桐油产量翻一番
    据新华社长沙8日电　驰名国内外市场的湖南湘西金色桐油，打破了“一年丰收，一年歉收”的常规，在1958年获得空前大丰收。
    据湘西土家族苗族自治州林业局统计：1958年，全州桐油产量已达到二十万担，比丰收了的1957年增产25％，比解放初期增产五倍多。古丈县断龙山公社的一万四千五百九十四亩油桐林，1958年总共出产金色桐油一百八十一万斤，平均亩产一百二十四斤，比1957年增产五倍，比解放初期全县的桐油总产量还多八十一万斤。目前，自治州的金色桐油正沿着峒河，酉水、澧水和湘（湖南）川（四川）、大（大庸）慈（慈利）公路源源运出山区，支援各地工业建设。
    湘西土家族苗族自治州是盛产桐油的地方，但在解放前，由于国民党反动派对油桐产区进行了摧残和掠夺政策，每担金色桐油只能换食盐三十斤。因此，自治州几十万亩油桐逐年荒芜。解放几年来，自治州党组织一手抓粮食，一手抓山货，把培育油桐列为农业生产内容之一，这就使湘西桐油生产走上了一个新的发展阶段。
    1958年湘西桐油获得大丰收的主要原因是：一、大搞梯田化。自治州山区大都是青沙土，山洪一来，容易冲刷流失。几年来，全州人民把植油桐林的陡坡，一般都修成梯田。这样，增加了山地的蓄水保土能力，使桐树得到充足养分，结实多，储油多。二、中耕除草。解放前，全州各民族农民虽然有经营油桐的习惯，但管理比较差，只有部分地区实行夏季除草，一般都是“听天由命”。如今，各族农民对油桐一般都进行一—二次的中耕除草，部分地区还开始实行斩主根繁须根，加施肥料、防虫、修枝等培育办法。三、大搞粮林结合。这是一个加强油桐管理的特效办法。人们在油桐林里播种杂粮作物以后，一年就得进行几次松土、中耕、追肥、培壤工作，对壮大桐树有很大好处。
    今年，自治州计划在1958年的基础上，使桐油的产量再翻一番，全州今年的油桐采摘面积将比1958年增加40％多。为加强油桐的培育管理工作，自治州各级管理油桐生产的技术人员，已都深入山寨，同各族农民一起上岭下谷，斩根松土，力争实现今年的跃进计划。
