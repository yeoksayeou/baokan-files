Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 14th: Moscow newspapers today published editorials celebrating the ninth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship Alliance and Mutual Assistance.
    “Pravda” published an editorial entitled "Brotherly Friendship of Great Peoples," and devoted the entire third page to articles and communications celebrating Sino-Soviet friendship.
    “Red Star” said in its editorial that the friendship between the Soviet Union, China, and the socialist camp countries is not limited to the economic, scientific, and cultural fields. Cooperation in consolidating the defense power of our countries is being strengthened and developed. The fraternal alliance of socialist countries and Sino-Soviet friendship play a major role in thwarting imperialist aggression attempts. The meeting between Comrade Khrushchev and Comrade Mao Zedong in August 1958 was of great significance in this regard, providing a serious warning to all attempts to launch a war against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.
    “Literary Gazette” said that the unity of action between China and the Soviet Union plays a decisive role in defending lasting peace. Just when revisionists are daydreaming of finding differences between China and the Soviet Union, our two countries have signed new agreements to expand economic cooperation. "Literary Gazette" emphasized: The friendship between China and the Soviet Union is higher than the sky and deeper than the sea.

    庆祝中苏条约签订九周年
    莫斯科各报发表社论
    新华社莫斯科14日电　莫斯科的报纸今天都发表社论，庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订九周年。
    “真理报”发表了题为“伟大人民的兄弟友谊”的社论，并且用第三版整版的篇幅刊登了庆祝中苏友谊的文章和通讯。
    “红星报”在社论中说，苏联、中国和社会主义阵营各国的友谊并不只限于经济、科学和文化领域之内。在巩固我们各国国防威力中的合作正在巩固和发展。社会主义各国的兄弟联盟和苏中友谊在挫败帝国主义侵略企图中起着重大作用。赫鲁晓夫同志和毛泽东同志1958年8月的会见在这方面有着巨大意义，这是给予想发动反对苏联和其他社会主义国家战争的一切企图的严重警告。
    “文学报”说，苏中两国行动的一致在保卫持久和平中起着决定性作用。正当修正主义者痴心梦想寻找苏中两国分歧的时候，我们两国又签订了新的扩大经济合作的协定。“文学报”强调说：苏中两国的友谊比天还高，比海还深。
