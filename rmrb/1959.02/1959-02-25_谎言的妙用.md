    The Clever Use of Lies
    The famous American economist Perlo recently wrote an article exposing the lies in Eisenhower's economic message. The message attacked labor's demands for increased wages, saying that wage increases cause prices to rise and "help create a crisis."
    Interestingly, didn't Dulles boast that in a "free society" like the United States, ordinary workers "consume" "most" of the products they produce, living a life of "glory" and "personal dignity"? Why has the "good thing" that Dulles promoted become the target of Eisenhower's attacks?
    This is no secret. What Dulles said was also a ridiculous lie. However, the same lie has different clever uses. Eisenhower attacked labor for "enjoying too much" in order to tighten the belts of the workers. Dulles promoted the "good life" of American workers in order to attack the truly increasing perfection and happiness of the lives of the working people in our People's Communes and other socialist countries.

### 谎言的妙用

    谎言的妙用
    美国著名经济学家佩洛最近写了一篇文章，揭露艾森豪威尔在经济咨文中的谎言。咨文攻击劳工增加工资的要求，说工资增加，使物价上涨，并“帮助造成了危机”。
    有趣的是，杜勒斯不是吹嘘过，在美国这样的“自由的社会”里，普通劳动者怎样“消费”了自己生产的“大部分”产品，过着怎样“光荣”和“个人尊严”的生活吗？为什么杜勒斯宣扬的“好事”，变成了艾森豪威尔攻击的对象了呢？
    这一点也不是什么秘密。杜勒斯说的同样是可笑的谎言。不过，这同样的谎言，却有了不同的妙用。艾森豪威尔所以要攻击劳工“享受过多”，是为了要把劳工的腰带束得更紧。杜勒斯所以要宣扬美国劳工的“好生活”，是为了攻击我国人民公社和其他社会主义国家劳动人民生活的真正的日益美满和幸福。
