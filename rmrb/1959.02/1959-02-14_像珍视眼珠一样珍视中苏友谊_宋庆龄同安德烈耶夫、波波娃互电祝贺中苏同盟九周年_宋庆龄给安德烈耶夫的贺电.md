    Cherish the Sino-Soviet Friendship as the Apple of One's Eye
    Soong Ching Ling Exchanged Congratulatory Telegrams with Andreyev and Popova on the 9th Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Alliance
    Soong Ching Ling's Congratulatory Telegram to Andreyev
    Respected Comrade Andreyev:
    On the occasion of the 9th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, on behalf of all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, I extend the most sincere and warmest congratulations to you, and through you, to the fraternal and great Soviet people with unparalleled excitement!
    For nine years, countless vivid facts have proven that the friendly unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union, the two great powers, is the most important factor in the unity of the socialist camp and a reliable guarantee for defending world peace. No force in the world can stop the friendship and unity of the people of our two countries, China and the Soviet Union. Although the US imperialists and modern revisionists spare no despicable means to provoke and sabotage, this conspiracy will inevitably suffer the most shameful failure as in the past.
    We are excited to see that the recent successful launch of the giant cosmic rocket by the Soviet Union and the victorious convocation of the 21st Extraordinary Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have made epoch-making great contributions to all mankind. The magnificent program of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan for the Development of National Economy adopted by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a great red flag for building communism, vividly demonstrating the Soviet Union's strength, prosperity, and determination and power to defend world peace. We Chinese people are greatly delighted and encouraged by this.
    Recently, China and the Soviet Union signed an agreement to expand economic cooperation. The Soviet Union has once again helped our country build seventy-eight large-scale industrial enterprises and power stations, which will effectively promote our country's socialist construction. We express our deep gratitude for this.
    The Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China cherish the great friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union like the apple of their eye. We will always be loyal to this alliance and will continue to learn from the great Soviet people. Let us always unite closely together, stride forward with heroic steps, and continue to advance victoriously.
    I wish the great Soviet people even more brilliant achievements in the cause of building communism and defending world peace!
    Long live the eternal and great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!
                                              Soong Ching Ling

      Andreyev's Congratulatory Telegram to Soong Ching Ling
    Respected Comrade Soong Ching Ling! Dear friends!
    On the occasion of the 9th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the Council of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association extends its heartfelt congratulations to you and all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. The conclusion of this treaty marked a new stage in Soviet-Chinese relations and laid a solid foundation for broad and comprehensive cooperation between our two countries. The peoples of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, as well as the peoples of all countries in the socialist camp, are advancing shoulder to shoulder with full confidence, giving each other fraternal assistance and support. The Soviet people believe that the realization of the magnificent program of communist construction formulated by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the completion of the economic plans of socialist countries will be a victory of world historical significance for the socialist system over the capitalist system, and another victory for Marxism-Leninism.
    In his report at the historically significant 21st Congress of the CPSU, Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet Union considers it its most important task to continue to promote the strengthening of the unity of all countries in the world socialist system, and to continue to promote the cooperation, economic ties and cultural ties of socialist countries on the basis of the principles of socialist internationalism, that is, on the basis of the fraternal friendship of free peoples.
    An agreement signed by Comrades Khrushchev and Zhou Enlai in Moscow on February 7, 1959, regarding cooperation between the two sides in the construction of seventy-eight large-scale industrial enterprises in the People's Republic of China between 1959 and 1967, is a new and important link in expanding the effective economic ties and fraternal mutual assistance between the Soviet Union and China. We Soviets are particularly pleased because this agreement will help China's socialist construction and further strengthen the power of the socialist camp.
    I wish the unbreakable friendship and fraternal cooperation between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China will be increasingly strengthened and developed!
                      A. Andreyev
                      Chairman of the Council of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association

               Soong Ching Ling's Congratulatory Telegram to Popova
    Dear Comrade Popova:
    On the occasion of the 9th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, on behalf of all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, I extend the most sincere and warmest congratulations to you, and through you, to the fraternal and great Soviet people.
    Over the past nine years, the friendly cooperative relations between China and the Soviet Union in the political, economic, cultural and other fields have continuously achieved great development and achievements. The recently concluded 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the signing of the agreement on further expanding economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union will more powerfully encourage our people to unite closely with the great Soviet people to jointly strive for the great cause of defending world peace and human progress.
    I sincerely wish the great Soviet people even more brilliant achievements in the cause of building communism and safeguarding world peace.
    Long live the eternal and unbreakable great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!
                                Soong Ching Ling

The past nine years have vividly demonstrated how outstanding the results of this treaty have brought to the economic and cultural upsurge of our two countries.

    像珍视眼珠一样珍视中苏友谊
    宋庆龄同安德烈耶夫、波波娃互电祝贺中苏同盟九周年
    宋庆龄给安德烈耶夫的贺电敬爱的安德烈耶夫同志：
    欣逢中苏友好同盟互助条约签订九周年，谨代表中苏友好协会全体会员，以无比兴奋的心情，向您，并通过您向兄弟般的伟大苏联人民表示最诚挚最热烈的祝贺！
    九年来，无数的生动事实证实着：中苏两大国人民的友好团结，是社会主义阵营团结的最重要的因素，是保卫世界和平的可靠的保证。世界上没有任何一种力量，可以阻止住我们中苏两国人民的友好和团结。尽管美帝国主义者和现代修正主义者不惜采取一切卑鄙手段，进行挑拨和破坏，但是这种阴谋必将同以往一样遭到最可耻的失败。
    我们兴奋地看到：不久前，苏联成功地发射了巨型宇宙火箭以及苏联共产党第二十一次非常代表大会的胜利召开，给全人类作出了划时代的伟大贡献。苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会所通过的苏联发展国民经济七年计划的宏伟纲领，是一面伟大的建设共产主义的红旗，生动地显示了苏联的强大，繁荣和保卫世界和平的决心和力量，我们中国人民都为此感到极大的欢欣和鼓舞。
    最近，中苏两国签订了扩大经济合作的协定，苏联又一次帮助我国建设七十八个大型工业企业和电站，它将有力地促进我国的社会主义建设，我们对此表示深切的感谢。
    在中国共产党领导下的中国人民，像珍视眼珠一样珍视中苏两国人民的伟大友谊和团结。我们将永远忠于这个同盟，并将继续不断地向伟大的苏联人民学习。让我们永远紧密地团结在一起，迈开英雄的步伐，继续胜利前进。
    祝伟大的苏联人民在建设共产主义和保卫世界和平的事业中取得更辉煌的成就！
    中苏两国人民永恒的伟大的友谊万岁！
                                              中苏友好协会总会会长　宋庆龄
                                                1959、2、13
      安德烈耶夫给宋庆龄的贺电尊敬的宋庆龄同志！亲爱的朋友们！
    值此苏联和中华人民共和国签订友好同盟互助条约九周年纪念之际，苏中友好协会理事会谨向您和中苏友好协会的全体会员致以衷心的祝贺。这个条约的缔结标志着苏中关系的一个新阶段，为我们两国广泛而全面的合作奠定了牢固的基础。苏联和中华人民共和国两国人民以及社会主义阵营各国人民信心百倍地并肩前进，互相给予兄弟般的援助和支持。苏联人民相信，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会所拟定的共产主义建设的宏伟纲领的实现和社会主义各国的经济计划的完成，将是世界社会主义体系对于资本主义体系的具有世界历史意义的胜利，是马克思列宁主义的又一个胜利。
    尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫在具有历史意义的苏共第二十一次代表大会上所作的报告中指出，苏联认为，继续促进世界社会主义体系各国团结的加强，继续促进社会主义各国在社会主义国际主义的原则上，即在自由的各国人民的兄弟友好的基础上的合作、经济联系和文化联系的发展，是自己的一项极其重要的任务。
    赫鲁晓夫同志和周恩来同志1959年2月7日在莫斯科签订的一项关于双方进行合作在1959年到1967年间在中华人民共和国建设七十八个大型工业企业的协定，是扩大苏中两国有成效的经济联系和兄弟互助的一个新的重要环节。我们苏联人特别高兴，因为这个协定将帮助中国的社会主义建设和进一步加强社会主义阵营的威力。
    祝苏联和中华人民共和国两国人民牢不可破的友谊和兄弟合作日益加强和发展！
                      苏中友好协会理事会主席　安·安德烈耶夫
               宋庆龄给波波娃的贺电亲爱的波波娃同志：
    值此中苏友好同盟互助条约签订九周年之际，谨代表中苏友好协会全体会员，向你并通过你向兄弟般的伟大苏联人民，表示最诚挚最热烈的祝贺。
    九年以来，中苏两国在政治、经济、文化等各方面的友好合作关系，不断地获得了巨大的发展和成就。不久之前胜利闭幕的苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会和关于进一步扩大中苏两国间经济合作协定的签订，将更有力地鼓舞着我国人民同伟大的苏联人民紧密地团结在一起，共同为保卫世界和平和人类进步的伟大事业而奋斗。
    衷心地祝愿伟大的苏联人民，在建设共产主义和维护世界和平的事业中，取得更辉煌的成就。
    中苏两国人民永恒的牢不可破的伟大友谊万岁！

                                               1959年2月13日

    谨代表苏联对外友好和文化协会联合会理事会主席团，并以我个人的名义，向您，以及向中苏友好协会全体会员，热烈祝贺中苏友好同盟互助条约签订九周年。过去的九年鲜明地证实着，这个条约对于我们两国的经济和文化的高涨带来了如何出色的效果。在这个条约基础上，所发展起来的中苏两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊和紧密合作，是中苏两国人民向着人类光辉未来——共产主义勇往迈进的坚强保证，它已成为巩固整个社会主义阵营和一切爱好和平人民的国际团结的决定性力量。
    热烈地祝愿中苏友好协会全体会员和全中国人民，在社会主义建设中，在进一步发展我们两国人民之间永恒的友谊中，获得新的光辉的成就。
