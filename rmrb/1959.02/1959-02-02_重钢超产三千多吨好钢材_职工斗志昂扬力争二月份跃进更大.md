Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 1st: The workers of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's Large Rolling Mill and Small Rolling Mill brilliantly fired the first shot of this year's production, exceeding the state plan for January and rolling an extra 3,193 tons of high-quality steel for the country, an increase of 8.5% compared to December of last year.

In order to produce more and better steel to meet the needs of national construction, at the beginning of this year, the workers of these two rolling mills, on the basis of summarizing last year's production experience, devoted themselves to the intense battle of "urging steel to become material" with greater enthusiasm. The workers of the Large Rolling Mill launched a "four-guarantee" competition focusing on output, quality, maintenance, and safe production. The factory's leading cadres and engineering technical personnel also went to the workshops to work alongside the workers. The workers in the gas furnace vigorously promoted the advanced operating experience of burning low-temperature thick coal seams, thereby solving the problem of insufficient gas and steam. The steel rolling workers also worked diligently in inspection and meticulous operation, and everyone provided support when there were difficulties. Therefore, this factory achieved over-fulfillment in every ten-day period in January.

In January of this year, the workers of the Small Rolling Mill established technical revolution research groups in each shift, summarized and promoted technical operating experience such as low-temperature rolling, rapid roll changing, and straightening while hot, and created two high-yield records, thereby ensuring the over-fulfillment of January's production tasks.

Currently, the workers of these two factories are actively discussing and arranging February's plan, striving for a greater leap forward in production.

    重钢超产三千多吨好钢材
    职工斗志昂扬力争二月份跃进更大
    新华社重庆1日电　重庆钢铁公司大型轧钢厂和小型轧钢厂的职工出色地打响今年生产的第一炮，1月份超额完成国家计划，为国家多轧制了三千一百九十三吨质量很好的钢材，比去年12月份增长8.5％。
    为了生产更多更好的钢材满足国家建设的需要，这两个轧钢厂的职工今年一开头就在总结去年生产经验的基础上，以更大的干劲投入“催钢成材”的紧张战斗。大型轧钢厂的工人们掀起了包产量、质量、检修和安全生产的“四包”竞赛热潮。厂里的领导干部、工程技术人员也到车间同职工一起劳动。煤气炉的工人大力推行了烧低温厚煤层的先进操作经验，从而解决了煤气和蒸气不足的问题。轧钢工人也做到了勤检查、细操作，一处有困难，大家都支援。因此这个厂1月份做到了旬旬超额。
    小型轧钢厂的职工今年1月份每班都成立了技术革命研究小组，总结和推广了低温轧制、快速换辊、趁热打直等技术操作经验，并且创造了两次高产纪录，因而保证超额完成了1月份生产任务。
    目前这两个厂的工人正在积极讨论和安排2月份的计划，争取生产更大跃进。
