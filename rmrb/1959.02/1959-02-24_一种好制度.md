An Excellent System

Gansu's Wu Shan County has universally implemented a wheat archive management system, a brand-new measure in this year's wheat field management.

The establishment of this system firstly ensures the earnest implementation of various wheat yield-increasing measures. Secondly, it facilitates our summing up the year's yield-increasing experiences, preparing better conditions for future production.

In promoting this system, Wu Shan County consistently adhered to relying on the masses. They relied on the masses to investigate the land's natural conditions, summarize past yield-increasing experiences, set examples, and vigorously promoted it with the unanimous approval of the masses. As a result, this work quickly achieved results, not only bringing about great changes in this year's wheat production but also developing the archive system itself.

    一种好制度
    甘肃武山县普遍推行了小麦档案管理制度，这是今年麦田管理中一项崭新的措施。
    建立这种制度，首先可以使小麦各项增产措施得到认真的贯彻。其次，又便于我们总结一年的增产经验，为将来的生产准备更好的条件。
    武山县在推行这个制度中，始终坚持依靠群众。他们依靠群众调查土地的自然条件，总结过去的增产经验，作出榜样，在群众一致赞同下才大力推广。结果这个工作迅速收到成效，不仅使今年小麦生产有了很大的变化，而且使档案制本身也有了发展。
