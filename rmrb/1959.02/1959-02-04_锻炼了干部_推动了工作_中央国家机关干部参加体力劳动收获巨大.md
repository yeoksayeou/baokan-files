Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: In 1958, the implementation of the Party Central Committee and State Council's decision on cadres participating in physical labor by the staff of central state organs has achieved remarkable results. The ideology and work style of many organ staff members have greatly improved, and a vibrant new atmosphere has emerged in the organs' lives.

In 1958, with the exception of a very small number of elderly and sick individuals, and those unable to participate for various reasons, the number of central state organ staff members participating in physical labor (excluding organ steelmaking) reached 95% of the total number of cadres capable of participating in labor. According to incomplete statistics for eleven months, staff members from various organs contributed a total of 1,752,200 labor days. Including participation in organ steelmaking, the average time each person spent participating in labor was more than one month.

Last year, state organ staff members participated in various labor projects such as building reservoirs, constructing highways, steelmaking, afforestation and greening, assisting suburban farmers with the autumn harvest and planting, supporting the expansion of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, running organ-operated factories, and planting experimental fields. They demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm and tenacious drive in every task, and successfully completed their assignments alongside the workers and peasants. For example, during the mass steelmaking campaign, central state organs established more than 1,500 small steel furnaces, producing 3,287 tons of steel. Furthermore, they sent 2,000 people daily to support the expansion of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, which continued for three months.

The participation of organ staff members in physical labor not only created material wealth for the country, but more importantly, further strengthened the relationship between leaders and the masses, and also greatly trained the organ staff members. One civil construction engineer, for example, used to be very disrespectful of workers' opinions. In one construction project, workers made three reasonable suggestions for modifying his design drawings, but he refused to accept them and instructed "construct according to the drawing." Recently, while participating in labor training at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, he deeply felt how a single mistake on a drawing could lead to the waste of so much labor and national wealth. Therefore, while laboring, he diligently studied and revised his design drawings with the workers, saving a large amount of earthwork and labor for the project.

The decision for organ staff members to participate in one month of physical labor in 1958 also promoted a great leap forward in organ work. All staff members in the organs, while facing a shortage of personnel and a heavy workload, displayed even greater enthusiasm and competed with comrades who were participating in labor. At the same time, comrades who participated in labor brought back even greater enthusiasm from the labor site. Consequently, a vigorous and dynamic great leap forward situation emerged universally in central organs in 1958.

The great achievements of central state organ staff members in participating in physical labor are due to the correctness of the instructions and decisions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the importance attached by the Party committees and leading cadres of various organs, and the increased ideological awareness of the vast number of staff members after the rectification and anti-rightist struggle. Over the past year, the participation of central state organ staff members in physical labor has gradually become regular and institutionalized, and leadership will be further strengthened and persevered with in the future. In 1959, cadres from central state organs have already begun to take turns participating in physical labor training according to a certain proportion, and various organs have made comprehensive arrangements for the work, labor, and study of all cadres. According to the current arrangements, it is expected that central state organ staff members will participate in tasks such as greening and afforestation of the capital, developing agricultural and sideline production, running their own factories and experimental fields, and supporting the capital's municipal construction and the construction of the Miyun Reservoir this year.

### 锻炼了干部  推动了工作  中央国家机关干部参加体力劳动收获巨大

    锻炼了干部  推动了工作
    中央国家机关干部参加体力劳动收获巨大
    据新华社3日讯  1958年内，中央国家机关工作人员执行党中央和国务院关于干部参加体力劳动的决定已经取得了显著的成绩。很多机关工作人员的思想作风有了很大改进，机关生活也出现了生气勃勃的新气象。
    中央国家机关工作人员在1958年内除极少数年老有病和因各种原因未能参加劳动的以外，参加体力劳动的人数（不包括机关炼钢在内）达到了能够参加劳动的干部总数的95％。根据十一个月的不完全统计，各机关工作人员共做了一百七十五万二千二百个劳动日，再加上参加机关炼钢，平均每人参加劳动的时间在一个月以上。
    国家机关工作人员在去年内参加了修建水库、兴修公路、炼钢、绿化造林、帮助郊区农民秋收秋种、支援石景山钢铁厂扩建、机关自办工厂、种试验田等各种项目的劳动，他们在每一项劳动中都表现了高度的劳动热情和顽强的干劲，同工农群众一起出色地完成了任务。例如，在全民炼钢运动中，中央国家机关建立了各种小炼钢炉一千五百多座，炼钢三千二百八十七吨；并且每天派出二千人到石景山支援钢铁厂的扩建，一直延续了三个月之久。
    机关工作人员参加体力劳动不仅为国家创造了物质财富，更重要的是进一步密切了领导和群众的关系，并且使机关工作人员受到了很大的锻炼。有一位土木建设工程师，过去很不尊重工人的意见；在一项建设工程中工人对他设计的图纸曾经提出了三次合理的修改建议，他都不接受而批示“照图施工”。最近在石景山钢铁厂参加劳动锻炼中，他深切地感到图纸上的一笔之错，就会造成多少劳动力和国家财富的浪费。因此，他一面劳动，一面同工人一起认真研究和修改他的设计图纸，使工程节省了大量的土方和劳动力。
    1958年机关工作人员执行参加体力劳动一个月的决定，也促进了机关工作的跃进。机关中所有的工作人员都是在人少事多的情况下，发挥更大的干劲，同正在参加劳动的同志展开了竞赛，同时，参加劳动的同志也从劳动现场带回来了更大的干劲。因而1958年中央各机关普遍出现了干劲十足、生气勃勃的跃进局面。
    中央国家机关工作人员参加体力劳动取得了很大成绩，这是由于党中央和国务院的指示决定的正确，由于各机关党委和领导干部的重视以及广大工作人员在整风、反右派斗争以后思想觉悟提高的结果。一年来，中央国家机关工作人员参加体力劳动已逐步经常化、制度化，今后还要进一步加强领导，坚持下去。1959年，中央国家机关的干部已经按照一定的比例开始轮流参加体力劳动的锻炼，各机关对全体干部的工作、劳动和学习也都作了全面安排。根据目前的安排，预计今年中央国家机关工作人员将参加首都绿化造林、开展农副业生产、自办工厂和试验田、支援首都市政建设和兴修密云水库等项劳动。
