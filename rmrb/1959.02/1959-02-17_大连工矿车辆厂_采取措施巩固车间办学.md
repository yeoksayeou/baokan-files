Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, 16th - The Dalian Mining and Industrial Vehicle Factory is continuously taking measures to consolidate workshop-run spare time schools. Recently, the factory mobilized the masses to carry out teaching reforms, closely integrating teaching with workshop production. Some workshops have also readjusted production and study schedules according to specific circumstances, bringing the enrollment rate of workers to 95%.

For the past three months, each workshop in the factory has established political, cultural, and technical spare time schools, ranging from elementary to high school levels, based on the principle of "the secretary takes the lead, and the capable become teachers." Recently, each workshop dispatched cadres and teachers to solicit opinions from workers and improve the work of workshop-run schools. For example, in the tool workshop, ordinary school textbooks were used at the beginning, and arithmetic examples were about "the tortoise and the hare race" and "how many birds are on the tree," etc. The workers felt that these contents were not related to production, and they lost interest in learning. After the workshop learned about these opinions, they tried to use examples from workshop production in their teaching and compiled easy-to-understand worker mathematics, which greatly increased the workers' interest in this subject.

    大连工矿车辆厂
    采取措施巩固车间办学
    据新华社旅大16日电　大连工矿车辆厂不断采取措施，巩固车间业余学校。最近一个时期，工厂发动群众，进行教学改革，使教学和车间生产紧密结合。有的车间并根据具体情况，重新安排生产和学习时间，使工人的入学率达到了95％。
    近三个月以来，这个厂的各车间都根据书记挂帅，能者为师的原则，在车间办起了从高小到高中的政治、文化、技术业余学校。最近各车间又派干部和教师分头向工人征求意见，改进车间办学的工作。如像工具车间，办学初期都是采用普通学校的教科书，算术例题是计算“龟兔赛跑”、“树上几只鸟”等，工人们觉得，这些内容和生产联不起来，越学越没有劲。车间了解到这些意见以后，在教学中尽量举车间生产的例子，编成了通俗易懂的职工数学，大大提高了工人们对这门课的兴趣。
