The Great Leap Forward's great victory in 1958 was a victory for the people's high degree of subjective initiative.
    If we are to summarize the experience of the unprecedented victory of our socialist construction in 1958, then the first point should be: under the guidance of the Party's correct policies and guidelines, maximizing the subjective initiative of the people is the fundamental reason for our victory in the Great Leap Forward. The Marxist thesis that people are the most active factor in production has been fully confirmed in the great practice of 1958. The creation of what people call a miracle—grain, cotton, steel, coal, and machine tools all increasing by more than double in one year—is neither a gift from God nor because we suddenly possessed special material and technical conditions. The most important reason is that hundreds of millions of people exerted unprecedentedly great subjective initiative. Those one-sided theorists who only saw things and not people, who only saw difficult conditions and not favorable conditions, were thoroughly negated in 1958. The role of people living under the socialist system after the smashing of class oppression, the powerful subjective initiative of socialist new people on the objective world, was fully affirmed in the practice of the Great Leap Forward.

    The people are the heroes of our time, the creators of miracles, and the masters of the Great Leap Forward. How did the people's surging momentum and enormous power demonstrated in the Great Leap Forward emerge? If we compare this power to a volcanic eruption or the splitting of an atom, then what force makes the volcano erupt and the atom split? The practice of 1958 proves that it is the Party's correct policy of building socialism at a high speed. If we had not adopted a high-speed policy, our construction would still have developed, but the situation could not have been so vigorous, and the people's great wisdom and courage could not have been fully displayed. Conversely, if we adopt a high-speed construction policy, the situation will be completely different, it will become vigorous, the enthusiasm will be fierce, and we will move forward courageously. Our Party foresaw this possibility and put forward the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" at the beginning of 1958. This policy mobilized the initiative and creativity of hundreds of millions of people in a very short period of time, and the people's wisdom and talent poured out like a spring.

    The correct policy is like a key that opens the treasure house of the subjective initiative of hundreds of millions of people. Under the guidance of the correct policy, the high degree of development of the people's subjective initiative can reverse the situation, turn the negative into the positive, and turn difficulties into advantages. This truth, tested in the great practice of 1958, will surely exert its power in the greater leap forward of 1959. We must see both things and people, and at all times promote the soaring enthusiasm of the people—subjective initiative—in order to keep the wheels of construction turning rapidly. This is a fundamental experience of 1958.

    People's subjective initiative is built on the basis of understanding the laws of objective things.

    We emphasize the powerful role of the people's subjective initiative on objective existence under the guidance of the correct policy. Does that mean that this subjective initiative of people is a simple reflection of subjective will that can arbitrarily change objective laws? Of course not.

    According to dialectical materialism, objective existence is always primary, and human subjective understanding is a reflection of objective existence, and is secondary. Therefore, people's subjective initiative is based on objective laws and on the basis of objective possibilities. This possibility is people's understanding of objective laws.

    The great Soviet Union has accumulated rich experience and mastered the laws of socialist economic development in decades of construction practice. For example, the law of planned and proportionate development and the law of giving priority to the development of heavy industry have become universal laws for developing a socialist economy. We must conscientiously study the experience of Soviet socialist construction and conscientiously study the common laws of socialist construction that have been tested by long-term Soviet practice. However, how do we specifically apply these universal laws to guide our country's construction? How do we formulate a set of construction policies that both reflect the common laws of socialist construction and combine them with our country's actual conditions? The problem lies first in our need to conduct a scientific analysis of our country's objective reality.

    The Party and Comrade Mao Zedong have always emphasized the need to combine the universal truth of Marxism with our country's actual conditions. In the long revolutionary struggle, our Party was well versed in the revolutionary reality of our country. Under the guidance of the universal truth of Marxism, the Party formulated the correct policies and lines, and thus achieved revolutionary victory. However, we have only been engaged in socialist construction for a few years, so we cannot say that we are very familiar with the reality of construction. We must also explore and understand the specific objective laws of socialist construction in our country from practice, in order to open up a path of building with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The great significance of the great practice of 1958 lies here. We have found this path, which is to find the objective regularity that reflects our country's socialist construction. This regularity is reflected in a series of policies put forward by the Party in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, or in other words, the Party's series of policies meet the requirements of our country's objective economic laws.

    What do the set of parallel development policies under the condition of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, and the policy of taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward formulated according to the law of planned and proportionate development, reflect? They reflect the objective regularity of building socialism at a high speed in our country, which has a vast territory, abundant resources, a large population, but is economically and culturally backward, but has the strong leadership of the Communist Party and 600 million hardworking and brave people. Because these policies meet the requirements of our country's objective economic laws, and fully take into account that 600 million people are also a huge factor in the objective world, these policies not only reflect the objective regularity of engaging in socialist construction in our country, but also reflect the subjective initiative of 600 million people with a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm.

    From this, we can see that the soaring enthusiasm of the people of our country in 1958—powerful subjective initiative—is not water without a source, or a tree without roots. It is built on the basis of scientific analysis, that is, understanding of objective reality. Because we have investigated the objective reality, have understanding, and have grasped the objective realistic possibilities, therefore, the development of people's soaring enthusiasm—subjective initiative—is invincible, and the great leap forward in industry and agriculture has been successfully realized. If we do not understand the set of parallel development policies and possess the objective possibility of developing our country's economy at a high speed, then our subjective initiative will be limited, and the vast industrial reserve force will not be able to quickly participate in the industrial front, and we will not be able to get 750 billion catties of grain and 11 million tons of steel within a year.

    Since this is the case, can it be considered that through the practice of last year's Great Leap Forward, we have completely understood and grasped the objective regularity of our country's socialist construction? Things are not like this. Socialist construction is an extremely arduous and complex great cause, and we have only been engaged in this cause for a few years. And people's understanding of the objective world can only be gradual. Because contradictions will not unfold until a certain time, they will not be reflected in people's minds, and people will not be able to recognize them all at once. For example, taking steel as the key link must lead to all-round development. People seem to recognize this objective law in reason, but what new contradictions will arise in the process of taking the key link and leading to all-round development? Before practice, we cannot fully recognize it. In the process of practice, new contradictions appear, so we supplement our subjective understanding and continuously improve our understanding of objective laws. Based on this understanding, we fully develop our subjective initiative, grasp the contradictions—the weak links in the work—and solve them one by one. Then we step onto a new stage and keep the wheel of the Great Leap Forward moving forward.

    There is no reason to be complacent. Comrade Mao Zedong told us: People's subjective understanding often lags behind objective reality. That is to say, things are in eternal change and development, and people's understanding of objective things often cannot keep up with the development of things. Socialist construction is still a brand-new undertaking for us. We cannot say that we have mastered the regularity in its development process. Freedom is necessity that has been recognized. Without recognizing necessity—objective laws—we cannot say that our construction skills have reached home. "...It is necessary to study this economic law, it is necessary to master it, it is necessary to learn to use it skillfully, it is necessary to formulate a plan that can fully reflect the requirements of this law." Stalin's passage in "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" is very useful to us.

    Recognizing and mastering objective regularity is to better develop subjective initiative. People's soaring enthusiasm is always the decisive factor in the Great Leap Forward.

    When we talk about people's subjective initiative, we should distinguish that subjective initiative and voluntarism, that is, subjective idealism, are completely different things. People's subjective initiative is that people develop their initiative on the basis of understanding objective things. It is consistent with objective laws, not contrary to them. Therefore, subjective initiative can act on the objective material basis and promote the development of things. Subjective idealism, on the other hand, believes that the development of objective things can be arbitrarily manipulated by oneself. It can ignore the material conditions and do whatever one wants, and does not pay attention to objective regularity at all. Therefore, it is like a fly in a glass house, crashing into the glass and never finding a way out. It can be seen that objective laws are completely incompatible with subjective idealists. They are enemies and cannot coexist. For dialectical materialists, objective laws and people's subjective initiative are opposed but unified. Objective laws, if you don't recognize them, are a limiting force, and even they will roar and resist you, but if you recognize them, you can drive them and become your own basis. Therefore, once people's subjective understanding is in line with objective laws, people are in freedom, and they can be successful in doing things. So we say that people's subjective initiative and objective regularity are interdependent and complementary.

    When we talk about objective laws, we should also distinguish that respecting objective laws and mechanical materialism are also completely different things. We respect objective laws in order to make people's subjective understanding conform to objective laws, so that people can master and apply objective laws, so as to develop people's subjective initiative and promote the development of objective things. That is to say, admitting the reaction of people's subjective initiative to objective things is the viewpoint of dialectical materialism. Mechanical materialism, on the other hand, believes that objective things are fixed and immutable, and that people are powerless in the face of objective laws, and there is no other way but to wait for death. They abandon people from the environment and forget that people also participate in the objective world. In their view, the regularity of the Yellow River has always been that it must flood every few years. People can only stare at the disaster of the Yellow River and there is no other way out. Dialectical materialism believes that as long as people recognize the objective regularity of the Yellow River flooding, people can rely on this regularity and develop subjective initiative to control it. It can be seen that people's subjective initiative is incompatible with mechanical materialists, but for dialectical materialists, subjective initiative and objective regularity are not enemies but complementary.

    In real life, there is also often this phenomenon. Emphasizing people's subjective initiative makes it easy to ignore objective regularity, and emphasizing objective regularity makes it easy to ignore subjective initiative. This is because we do not have a clear understanding of the correct relationship between people's subjective initiative and objective regularity, and it is easy to fall into a metaphysical one-sided viewpoint.

    Therefore, when we emphasize people's subjective initiative, we should not ignore the scientific analysis of objective reality with a calm mind. We despise difficulties, but we do not despise objective laws. In economic work, we must advocate practical calculations and arrangements, so that all our plans meet or substantially meet the requirements of objective economic laws, so as not to exceed objective possibilities. But we must never think that people's subjective initiative is not important because of this. On the contrary, we must fully develop people's subjective initiative at all times. At any time, the people's soaring enthusiasm is the decisive factor in the Great Leap Forward. We say that we must respect objective laws, not for any other purpose, but in how to enable people to develop people's subjective initiative more, better, and more comprehensively. All policies and plans that have been tested by practice must still rely on people's initiative and creativity to complete. People's rational understanding of objective laws, no matter how much it conforms to objective reality, is still empty talk if they do not go all out to practice it. And it is impossible to further understand the objective regularity of socialist construction through the production struggle of the masses, so as to improve and enrich people's subjective understanding. In this sense, the fundamental problem is still the development of people's subjective initiative.

    This is even more true from the current reality. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party summarized the rich experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and proposed more ambitious leap forward targets for 1959. These targets have all been examined for objective possibilities. This year's favorable conditions are more than last year. The main problem now is to develop the people's soaring enthusiasm. Once the masses' enthusiasm is raised, measures and methods will come out, and the realization of the Great Leap Forward will be more certain.

    People's soaring enthusiasm is always the decisive factor in the Great Leap Forward. Everything that can be done through effort should be done. The powerful subjective initiative of 600 million hardworking and brave people is the fundamental guarantee for us to complete and over fulfill this year's greater leap forward, and is the source of our striving for greater victory.

    人的冲天干劲是大跃进的决定因素
    张沛
    1958年大跃进的伟大胜利，是人民群众高度发挥主观能动性的胜利
    如果我们要为1958年我国社会主义建设的空前胜利作一个经验总结的话，那末写在第一条的，应当是：在党的正确的政策方针的指导下，最大限度地发挥人民群众的主观能动性，是我们取得大跃进胜利的基本原因。人是生产中的最活跃的因素，这一马克思主义的论断在1958年的伟大实践中，被充分地证实了。粮食、棉花、钢铁、煤炭、机床在一年中间增产一倍以上，这种被人们称为奇迹的创造，既不是上帝的赐与，也不是因为我们突然拥有了特殊的物质技术条件，最主要的是由于几亿人民发挥了空前巨大的主观能动性。那种只见物不见人、只见困难条件不见有利条件的片面论者，在1958年遭到了彻底的否定。粉碎了阶级压迫，生活在社会主义制度下的人的作用，社会主义新人的强大的主观能动性对客观世界的反作用，在大跃进的实践中被充分肯定了。
    人民是当代英雄，是奇迹的创造者，是大跃进的主人。人民群众在大跃进中表现的磅礴的气势和巨大的威力，是怎样出现的呢？如果我们把这种力量比之为火山爆发，比之为核子的分裂，那末又是什么力量使得火山爆发，使得核子分裂呢？1958年的实践证明，是党的高速度建设社会主义的正确方针。如果我们不是采取高速度的方针，我们的建设事业还是会有所发展，但局面不可能轰轰烈烈，人民群众的大智大勇也不可能充分显示出来。相反，如果采取高速度建设的方针，局面就完全不同，就会变得轰轰烈烈，干劲勇猛，一往直前。我们的党预见了这种可能性，1958年初提出了“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线。这个方针在很短的时间中，把几亿人民的积极性创造性动员起来了，人民群众的聪明才智犹如泉涌，滔滔而出。
    正确的方针像一把钥匙，打开了几亿人民主观能动性的宝库。在正确的方针指导下，人民群众的主观能动性的高度发挥，能够使形势倒转过来，能够化消极为积极，变困难为有利。这个在1958年伟大的实践中经过考验的真理，必将在1959年更大的跃进中发挥威力。必须见物又见人，任何时候都要发扬人民群众的冲天干劲——主观能动性，才能使建设的车轮不停地快速转动，这是1958年的一条根本经验。
    人的主观能动性是建筑在对客观事物发展的规律性的认识基础上的
    我们十分强调在正确方针的引导下，人民群众的主观能动性对客观存在的强大作用。那末是否认为人的这种主观能动作用，是一种可以任意改变客观规律的主观意志的单纯反映呢？当然不是的。
    按照辩证唯物论，客观存在从来是第一性的，人的主观认识则是客观存在的反映，是第二性的。因此，人的主观能动作用是以客观规律为依据的，是建筑在客观可能性的基础上的。这种可能性，就是人对客观规律的认识。
    伟大的苏联，在几十年的建设实践中，积累了丰富的经验，掌握了社会主义经济发展的规律。例如有计划按比例发展的规律、优先发展重工业的规律，已经成为发展社会主义经济的普遍规律。我们必须认真地学习苏联社会主义建设的经验，认真地研究经过苏联长期实践考验过的社会主义建设的共同规律。然而如何具体运用这些普遍性的规律来指导我国的建设呢？如何制订出一套既反映社会主义建设的共同规律而又结合我国实际的建设方针呢？问题首先在于我们要对我国的客观实际进行科学的分析。
    党和毛泽东同志历来强调要把马克思主义的普遍真理和我国的实际相结合。在长期的革命斗争中，我们的党熟谙了我国的革命实际，在马克思主义普遍真理的指引下，党制订了正确的方针路线，因而取得了革命的胜利。然而我们从事社会主义建设的时间还只有几年，因此还不能说，我们对于建设的实际已经很熟悉了。我们还必须从实践中来摸索、认识我国社会主义建设的具体的客观规律，以便打开一条多快好省的建设道路。1958年的伟大实践的伟大意义就在这里。我们找到了这条道路，也就是找到了反映我国社会主义建设的客观规律性。这个规律性反映在1958年大跃进中党所提出的一系列方针中，或者说，党的一系列的方针是符合我国客观经济规律的要求的。
    在优先发展重工业的条件下一整套并举的方针，根据有计划按比例发展的规律而制订的以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针，它们反映了什么呢？反映了在我们这个地大物博人多，然而经济文化都很落后，但有共产党的坚强领导和六亿勤劳勇敢的人民的国家里，高速度建设社会主义的客观规律性。因为这些方针切合我国客观经济规律的要求，并且充分考虑到六亿人民也是客观世界的巨大因素，因此这些方针既反映了在我国从事社会主义建设的客观规律性，也反映了有着高度革命热情的六亿人民的主观能动性。
    从这里可以看到，我国人民在1958年的冲天干劲——强大的主观能动性，并不是无源之水，无本之木，它是建筑在科学分析即对客观实际认识的基础上的。由于对客观实际进行过考察，有了认识，掌握了客观的现实可能性，因此人的冲天干劲——主观能动性的发挥，才战无不胜有的必中，胜利实现了工农业的大跃进。如果我们不认识一整套的并举方针，拥有高速度发展我国经济的客观可能性，那末，我们的主观能动性就将受到局限，广大的工业后备力量就无法迅速地参加到工业战线中来，也就不能在一年以内拿到七千五百亿斤粮食，一千一百万吨钢。
    既然这样，可不可以认为经过去年大跃进的实践，我们已经完全认识和掌握了我国社会主义建设的客观规律性呢？事情并不是这样。社会主义建设是一项极端艰巨而复杂的伟大事业，我们从事这项事业还只有几年。而人们对客观世界的认识，又只能是逐渐的。因为矛盾不到一定时候不会展开，因此就不会反映到人的脑子中来，人也就不能一下认识它。例如，以钢为纲必须纲举目张，人们在理性上似乎认识了这个客观规律，可是在纲举和目张的过程中，究竟会出现一些什么新的矛盾，在实践以前，我们还不可能完全认识它。在实践的过程中，新的矛盾出现了，于是就补充了我们的主观认识，使我们对客观规律的认识不断完善。基于这种认识，我们充分发挥主观能动性，抓住矛盾——工作中的薄弱环节，一个个将其解决，于是我们又踏上了一个新的阶梯，使大跃进的车轮不断向前。
    自满是没有任何理由的。毛泽东同志告诉我们：人们的主观认识常常落后于客观实际。这就是说，事物处在永恒的变化和发展中间，人们对客观事物的认识，常常赶不上事物的发展。社会主义建设对于我们来说，还是一项崭新的事业。它在发展过程中的规律性，还不能说我们已经掌握自如。自由是被认识了的必然，没有认识必然——客观规律，就不能说我们的建设本领已经到家了。“……必须研究这个经济法则，必须掌握它，必须学会熟练地运用它，必须制定
  出能完全反映这个法则的要求的计划。”斯大林在“苏联社会主义经济问题”中所讲的这段话，对我们很有用处。
    认识和掌握客观规律性是为了更好地发挥主观能动性。人的冲天干劲始终是大跃进的决定因素
    当我们谈到人的主观能动性时，应当分清楚，主观能动性和唯意志论即主观唯心论是完全不同的两回事。人的主观能动性是人在对客观事物认识的基础上发挥自己的能动作用，是和客观规律相吻合的，而不是背道而驰的。因此主观能动性能够反作用于客观的物质基础，促进事物的发展。而主观唯心论，则是认为客观事物的发展可以任意由自己摆布，可以不管物质条件如何，想怎么样就怎么样，根本不理会客观规律性，因此就像玻璃房子里的苍蝇，朝着玻璃乱撞，总也找不到出路。由此可见，客观规律对于主观唯心论者是截然不相容的，它们是对头，不能并存。对于辩证唯物论者，客观规律和人们的主观能动性是对立的却又是统一的。客观规律，你不认识它，是一种限制的力量，甚至它会咆哮起来向你反抗，但你认识了它，就能驾驶它，成为自己的依据。因此，人们的主观认识一旦符合客观规律，人就处在自由中，办起事来就能马到成功。所以我们说，人的主观能动性和客观规律性是相依为命相辅相成的。
    当我们谈到客观规律时，也应当分清楚，尊重客观规律和机械唯物论也是完全不同的两回事。我们尊重客观规律，是为了使人们的主观认识符合于客观规律，使人能掌握和运用客观规律，从而来发挥人的主观能动性，促进客观事物的发展。也就是说承认人的主观能动性对于客观事物的反作用，这是辩证唯物论的观点。而机械唯物论则认为客观事物是固定不变的，人在客观规律面前是无能为力的，除了束手待毙以外，没有别的办法。他们把人从环境中抛开，忘记了人也是参加到客观世界中来的。在他们看来，黄河的规律性从来就是隔若干年就一定要泛滥成灾。人对于黄河的灾害只好瞪着眼看着，没有其它出路。而辩证唯物论认为：只要认识了黄河泛滥的客观规律性，人就可以依据这种规律性，发挥主观能动性来治服它。由此可见，人的主观能动性对机械唯物论者是不相容的，但对于辩证唯物论者，主观能动性和客观规律性却不是冤家而是相辅相成的。
    在实际生活中还常常有这种现象，强调了人的主观能动性，就容易忽视客观规律性，强调了客观规律性，就容易忽视主观能动性，这是由于我们对人的主观能动性和客观规律性的正确关系认识不清，因而容易落入形而上学的片面观点中去。
    因此，我们在强调人的主观能动性时，不应当忽视用冷静的头脑对客观实际进行科学分析，我们藐视困难，但并不藐视客观规律。在经济工作中要提倡切实的计算和安排，使我们的一切计划符合或者大体符合于客观经济规律的要求，而不致超越客观的可能性。但绝不可因此以为人的主观能动性就不重要了，相反，任何时候都要充分发挥人的主观能动性，任何时候人民的冲天干劲都是大跃进的决定性因素。我们说要尊重客观规律，不是为了什么别的目的，而是在于如何使人能更大更好地更全面地发挥人的主观能动作用，一切经过实践检验的方针、计划，仍然必须依靠人的积极性创造性去完成。人对客观规律的理性认识，尽管多么符合于客观实际，如果不鼓足干劲去实践，还是一纸空谈，而且也就不可能通过群众的生产斗争，进一步认识社会主义建设的客观规律性，来提高和丰富人的主观认识。从这个意义上说，根本的问题，还是人的主观能动性的发扬。
    从当前的现实生活来看，更是这样。党的八届六中全会总结了1958年大跃进的丰富经验，提出了1959年更宏伟的跃进指标，这些指标都是考察了客观可能性的，今年的有利条件比去年更多，现在的主要问题就是要发挥人民的冲天干劲，群众干劲起来了，措施和办法就出来了，实现大跃进也就更有把握了。
    人的冲天干劲始终是大跃进的决定因素，一切经过努力可以办到的事我们都应当办到。勤劳勇敢的六亿人民的强大的主观能动作用，是我们完成和超额完成今年更大的跃进的根本保证，是我们争取更大胜利的源泉。
