Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 25th: The grand scale of the Soviet steel industry's development during the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965) is already evident this year. According to the plan, the scale of Soviet steel industry construction this year will exceed that of previous years. Pig iron production will increase from 39.68 million tons last year to 42.7 million tons; steel production will increase from 54.9 million tons last year to 59 million tons; steel products will increase from 42.9 million tons to 46 million tons; and annual iron ore production will increase to 92.7 million tons. This will further narrow the gap between the Soviet Union's production of steel, pig iron, and steel products and the production levels of these products in the United States this year; while iron ore production will be very close to the level of the United States. The annual iron ore production of the United States has remained around 100 million tons in the years before last year, while it only reached 79.1 million tons in 1954.

This year, the scale of capital construction in the Soviet steel industry exceeds that of previous years. In the years before 1958, the Soviet Union's capital construction investment for developing the steel industry increased by an average of 3% to 8% each year. Last year, the Soviet Union drastically accelerated the construction speed of steel industry enterprises, and capital construction investment in this area increased by 21% compared to 1957. However, according to this year's plan, the Soviet Union's capital construction investment in the steel industry will reach 109.8 billion rubles, 33.6% more than last year; the volume of capital construction work in the steel industry will be 33% more than last year. Within this year alone, five new blast furnaces, ten open-hearth furnaces, five electric steelmaking furnaces, one converter, and six giant rolling mills will be built and put into production. This year, the construction of the Soviet Union's third steel industry base will be vigorously carried out in Kazakhstan and Siberia. The construction workload of one of the base's important industrial enterprises, the Karaganda Iron and Steel Integrated Works, which will begin production this year, will be equal to 3.7 times that of last year.

This year, the basic construction investment in the Soviet iron ore mining industry has increased by 54% compared to last year, and new ore dressing complexes, mines, and mine shafts to be put into production can produce more than 22.2 million tons of iron ore annually. A number of new mining enterprises will be built in areas such as Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Kursk. The South Korobkovsky Mine and the Lebedinsky Mine in the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly region will both be put into production this year, the former will mine more than one million tons of iron ore this year. Irkutsk and Sverdlovsk are both starting construction on ore dressing complexes. In Ukraine, the New Krivoy Rog ore dressing complex will also be put into production this year, and the existing complexes will be further expanded.

In order to fully supply the coke needed by the steel industry, the Soviet Union will also build eight new coking furnaces this year, and coke production will reach more than 53.5 million tons. In addition, new measures will also be taken to develop the production of sintered ore.

    苏联钢铁工业建设规模空前宏伟
    今年钢产量将达五千九百万吨　生铁产量将达四千二百多万吨
    新华社莫斯科25日电　苏联七年计划（1959—1965年）期间钢铁工业发展的宏伟规模，在今年就已显示出来，根据计划，今年苏联钢铁工业的建设规模将超过往年，生铁产量将从去年的三千九百六十八万吨增加到四千二百七十万吨，钢产量将从去年的五千四百九十万吨增加到五千九百万吨，钢材要从四千二百九十万吨增加到四千六百万吨，铁矿砂年产量将增加到九千二百七十万吨。这将使苏联的钢、生铁和钢材产量同美国的这些产品的生产水平间的距离在今年进一步缩短；而铁矿砂产量则将十分接近美国的水平。美国的铁矿砂年产量在去年以前的几年中都保持在一亿吨上下，而1954年只达到七千九百一十万吨。
    今年，苏联钢铁工业的基本建设规模超过了往年。在1958年以前的几年中，苏联用于发展钢铁工业的基本建设投资每年平均增加3％至8％。去年，苏联急剧加快了钢铁工业企业的建设速度，用于这方面的基本建设投资比1957年增加了21％。然而，根据今年的计划，苏联用于钢铁工业的基本建设投资将达一千零九十八亿卢布，比去年多33.6％；钢铁工业的基本建设工作量将比去年多33％。在今年一年内，将要建成和投入生产五座新高炉、十座平炉、五座炼钢电炉、一座转炉和六台巨型轧钢机。今年将在哈萨克和西伯利亚大力开展苏联第三个钢铁工业基地的建设，这个基地的重要工业企业之一——卡拉干达钢铁联合工厂在今年将开始投入生产，它的建设工作量将等于去年的三点七倍。
    今年，苏联铁矿开采业的基本建设投资比去年增加了54％，要投入生产的新的选矿联合企业、矿山和矿井每年总共可以生产二千二百万吨以上的铁矿砂。在哈萨克、乌克兰、库尔斯克等地区，都将建成一批新的采矿企业。库尔斯克地磁异常地区的南科罗勃科夫斯克矿和列贝金斯克矿都要在今年投入生产，前者在今年将开采一百万吨以上铁矿砂。伊尔库次克和斯维德洛夫斯克都在开始动工建设选矿联合工厂。在乌克兰，新克里沃罗格的选矿联合工厂也将在今年投入生产，现有的联合工厂将进一步扩充。
    为了充分供应钢铁工业需要的焦炭，苏联今年还将建成八座新的炼焦炉，焦炭产量将达到五千三百五十万吨以上。此外，在发展烧结矿的生产方面也将采取新的措施。
