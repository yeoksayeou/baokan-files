    The Morning Light of Life
    Bai Yuan
    "During the cooperative movement in Zunhua County, there was a Wang Guofan Cooperative. The twenty-three poor peasant households only had three donkey legs and were called the 'Poor Bastards Cooperative.' Through their own efforts, they 'brought from the mountains' a large amount of production materials within three years, moving some visitors to tears. I think this is the image of our entire country." — Mao Zedong
    Three years have passed...
    The winter sun shines on a large dense patch of poplar trees beside the village. Below the high mountains on both sides, from west to east, more than one hundred and fifty households are arranged along a section of the highway. This is Xisishilipu Village in Zunhua County, where the original "Poor Bastards Cooperative" was located. Now it is a natural village of the Jianming People's Commune. After the implementation of communization last year, this became part of the commune and is the leadership center of the entire commune. A new commune history exhibition hall has been built in the middle of the village. Opposite the exhibition hall, a row of beautiful rooms in the commune's guesthouse face the bright sunshine across a spacious courtyard, specially for receiving cadres from other places and guests who come to visit.
    A strong wind has just blown for a day and a night. Thick ice still covers the rivers and ponds, and the ground is frozen solid. However, the spring plowing preparations in the village started even earlier than last year. People in groups are taking hoes and shovels to dig up the large piles of manure that have been accumulated even earlier. Those cooperative members who used to have only three donkey legs are starting up the tractors they bought after the great leap forward in production last year. The tractors, rumbling through the village, are pulling large trailers loaded with manure, delivering loads after load to the fields. The tractors, having delivered the manure, turn around and drive back from the fields, climbing up the dirt slopes beside the village that are piled high with manure. The cooperative members waiting there are digging and shoveling, quickly filling the trailers behind the tractors. Then, with one hand holding the handle of the hoe or shovel and the other hand on their hips, just like the skilled old workers we have seen. When the tractors drive away from them, their expressions seem to say, "This is how things should be." The tractors drive out from the east end of the village for a while, and then drive back from the west end of the village. All day long, every now and then, they rumble through the village...
    At night, the electric lights in the village are lit. People gather around the stove, talking about the miracles of life and brilliant ideals. At this time, the village's generator rumbles rhythmically, as if providing the beat for a beautiful song of life.
    The commune's community committee is located at the west end of the village. Wang Guofan, whom we are familiar with, was elected as the head of the commune. He is a tall, thin middle-aged man with prominent cheekbones and deep-set eyes, showing that he is shrewd and capable. As an old Communist Party member, he has developed a tenacious character in the face of various difficult struggles and is full of confidence in his cause. It was he, along with several old Communist Party members, who led twenty-three poor peasant households to establish a cooperative six years ago, and now he is working with them to carry out communization, staying busy all day long.
    People come and go in the village all day long. Young girls wear brightly colored clothes. Lines of carts, from morning to night, haul loads of firewood from the mountains. It seems that they are still going to the mountains to "take." Six years ago, they "brought from the mountains" many mules, donkeys, cattle, sheep, pigs, carts, and many other things, and they still haven't finished taking them. Wang Guofan said that after the establishment of the commune, as long as everyone goes to the mountains to cut two hundred catties of firewood, they can buy a truck. In addition to the endless supply of firewood, there are also large patches of walnuts, chestnuts, apples, and pears in the deep mountains, and it was only recently discovered that there are also iron ore deposits buried in the mountains.
    In the commune's collective dining hall, separate dining rooms have been set up for the elderly, young people, and pregnant women. Because everyone is spending the Spring Festival at home, the dining hall is not cooking now. In the hospital's clinic, a mother is holding a chubby child to see the doctor. The doctor asks her, "What's wrong?" She says, "It's nothing much, but he doesn't sleep well at night and doesn't eat well during the day. I don't know why he's so restless." The doctor and mother coax him for a long time, finally getting him to open his mouth to look at his tonsils... No matter when, life is always so worrying and yet so sweet. In the home for the elderly, every room is covered with colorful New Year pictures for the Spring Festival. The elderly men hold long pipes and sit by the kang table with a pot of tea. They sit silently, their faces appearing both stern and peaceful, like a seagoing ship that has just anchored in the harbor of life, reflecting on the bumpy road of life while observing the bustling life around them, with a morning light of life shining in the twilight of their lives.
    Right under that morning light of life, the people of Xisishilipu Village have built a long row of new houses made of stone on an open space beside the village, and on another open space are piled more than one hundred thousand catties of peanuts that have not yet been put into storage.
    Sheep graze on the hillside; silent herds of pigs lie quietly in their secluded dwellings...
    The herds of donkeys, having returned from working outside, are stretching their mouths into the troughs, chewing contentedly. Among the donkeys, there is a gray-white donkey about seven years old. This is the donkey that, six years ago, when the twenty-three poor peasant households established the cooperative, was considered to have only three legs worth of a donkey share. Now, it is calculated that it was only a little over one year old at that time. Even this young donkey did not entirely belong to the twenty-three old poor peasants. But this "witness" saw how people moved from cooperation to communization, and saw what kind of scene appeared on this path: just as the people here say, "In the past, there were only three donkey legs, but now tractors run everywhere." During the great leap forward in production last year, the original "Poor Bastards Cooperative" bought a tractor, and after the implementation of communization, the number of tractors increased to three. Perhaps because the cooperative members are particularly fond of it, the gray-white donkey has grown fat and strong, covered in a glossy coat of fur. "We will never let it leave here again," one of the original twenty-three poor peasant households said to the people, "Let it live with us for the rest of its life..." Yes, let it testify to those who do not believe, and see how glorious and splendid the road of life that started from those twenty-three old poor peasant households is!
    The tractors rumbling through the village are sounding again. Leaving from the east end of the village, and following the highway for more than ten li, we arrive at a village called Jieguanting. In a deep gully two or three li northwest of Jieguanting Village, the cooperative members built a large reservoir during the Great Leap Forward last year. A monument stands in front of the dam of the reservoir, and people have named it the Jieguanting Reservoir. Climbing up a steep slope along the mountain root from the side of the monument, and standing on the dam, we can see a body of water impounded by the towering mountains, which can be used to irrigate more than 20,000 mu of farmland. Last year, a total of several tens of thousands of people came here to build the reservoir. There were originally many fish in the reservoir, and after the establishment of the commune, more than 10,000 fish fry were put into it to breed. Now the water in the reservoir is still frozen with a thick layer of ice, and because of fear that the fish may be suffocated by the ice, the cooperative members who are guarding the reservoir here have chiseled several large ice holes in the ice surface. Standing on the dam, we suddenly hear a sound howling under the water. The sound is so deep and so loud that the surrounding mountains all rumble along with it. Is it the water monster in the myth groaning under the water? Of course not. People who personally witnessed it last year will definitely remember that it is the huge echo left by the thousands of troops and horses of the Great Leap Forward. That huge echo exists not only here, but also in factories, in fields, and in every place that the footsteps of the Great Leap Forward have trod, and even more huge echoes ring out on new journeys...

    生活的晨光

    遵化县的合作化运动中，有一个王国藩合作社，二十三户贫农只有三条驴腿，被人称为“穷棒子社”。他们用自己的努力，在三年时间内，“从山上取来”了大批生产资料，使得有些参观的人感动得下泪。我看这就是我们整个国家的形象。　——毛泽东
    三年又过去……。
    冬天的阳光照着村边一大片密密的白杨。在两边的高山下面，从西到东，一百五十多户人家排列在一截公路的两旁。这就是原来的那个“穷棒子社”所在的遵化县西四十里铺村，现在是建明人民公社的一个自然村。去年实行公社化以后，这里成了公社的一部分，而且是整个公社领导的中心。村子当中新建了一座公社的历史展览馆。在展览馆的对面，一排公社招待所的漂亮的房间隔着一块宽敞的院场照着明晃晃的阳光，专门接待外地的干部和到这里来参观的客人。
    刚刚刮过了一天一夜的大风，河塘上还盖着厚厚的冰块，土地还冻得嘣嘣响。可是村里的春耕准备工作，开始得比去年还早。人们一群群地拿着镐和锨，动手刨开那一大堆一大堆更早就积好的粪堆。那些过去只有三条驴腿的社员们，把他们在去年生产大跃进以后买回来的拖拉机开动起来。穿过村子的拖拉机轰隆隆地响着，后面拖着一辆大挂车，车上装满了粪肥一车车往地里送。把粪送到地里的拖拉机一转眼又从地里开回来，爬上村边堆满粪肥的那个土坡上。在那里等待它的社员们刨的刨、掀的掀，一下子把拖拉机后面的挂车装满，然后，一只手扶着镐锨的把手，一只手插在腰间，就像我们曾经看见过的那些熟练的老工人那样。当拖拉机从他们面前开走的时候，看看他们的那般神气，就是说：“事情就应该是这样。”拖拉机一会从村东头开出去，一会从村西头开回来，一天到晚，隔一会又在村子里轰隆隆地响……。
    夜晚，村里的电灯亮了。人们围着炉火，谈论着生活的奇迹和辉煌的理想。这时候，村子里的发电机一阵阵的响着，就像是为一首美丽的生活的歌曲在打着节拍一样。
    公社的社委会设在村子的西头。我们所熟悉的王国藩被选当了公社的社长。这是一个高瘦高瘦的中年人，突出的颧骨，深深的眼睛，看得出是个精明能干的人，作为一个老共产党员，在各种各样的困难的斗争当中养成了一副顽强的性格，对自己的事业充满信心。就是他，和几个老共产党员一起，六年前领导二十三户贫农搞合作化，现在又和他们一起在搞公社化，整天忙个不停。
    村子里整天人来人往。年青的姑娘们穿着花花绿绿的衣裳。一列一列的大车从早到晚往山上拉来一车车的木柴。看来他们一直还在到山上去“取”。六年以前，他们“从山上取来”许多的骡子、毛驴、牛、羊、猪、大车，还有其他许许多多的东西，到现在一直还没有取完。王国藩说，成立公社以后，只要每个人上山去砍二百斤木柴，就能买一辆载重汽车。除了无穷无尽的木柴，深山里还有一大片一大片的核桃、栗子、苹果、梨，而且不久以前才知道，山里面还埋藏有铁矿。
    在公社的集体饭堂里，分别设立了老人饭厅，青年饭厅，孕妇饭厅。因为大家都在家里过春节，现在饭堂不开火了。在医院的门诊室里，一位母亲抱着个胖小孩来看病。医生问她：“怎么啦？”她说：“怎么也不怎么，就是夜里不好好睡，白天不好好吃，不知怎么净闹腾。”医生和母亲哄了半天，让他张开口来看了看扁桃腺……无论什么时候，生活总是这样使人操劳而又甜蜜。敬老院里，每一间房间都贴满了过春节的五颜六色的年画。那些年迈的老人手上拿着长烟管，泡了一壶茶坐在炕桌边。他们静默地坐着，脸上的表情看来那样严峻又那样平静，就像是一只远航的海上的航船刚刚碇泊在生命的港湾，一面回想着那些坎坷的人生的路程，一面观赏着那一片繁嚣的生活，在他们的生命的晚霞当中辉耀着一片生活的晨光。
    就在那一片生活的晨光下面，西四十里铺村的人们在村边的一片空场上修建了一长列用石头砌起的新房，在另一片空场上堆着还没有来得及入仓的十几万斤的花生。
    羊群在山坡上放牧；静默的猪群在自己的幽居里躺着静养……。
    从外面出完了工回来的圈里的驴群，正把嘴伸到食槽里尽情地咀嚼。在驴群里，有一只灰白色的七岁口的毛驴，这就是六年前二十三户贫农搞合作化的时候按驴股只有三条驴腿的那一只毛驴。现在算起来，那时候它只有一岁多，就是这么一只幼小的毛驴，也不完全属于那二十三户老贫农。可是这一个“见证者”看到了人们怎样由合作化走到了公社化，看到了在这条道路上出现了一片什么样的景象：正像这里的人们所说的一样，“过去驴腿只三条，如今拖拉机到处跑。”去年一个生产大跃进，原来的“穷棒子社”就买了一部拖拉机，实行公社化以后，拖拉机又增加成了三部。大概是因为社员们特别宠爱的原故，那一只灰白色的毛驴长得又肥又壮，披着一身光润的皮毛。“再也不让它离开这里了，”原来的那二十三户贫农中的一位社员对人们说，
  “就让它和我们在一起过一辈子……”是的，让它向那些不相信的人们作证吧，看看从那二十三户老贫农开始走出来的生活的道路是多么的光辉灿烂！
    穿过村子的拖拉机，又在轰隆隆地响着。从村子的东头走出去，沿着公路走十多里地到了一个接官厅村。在接官厅村西北边二、三里地的一道深深的山沟里，去年大跃进的时候社员们在这里修筑了一座大水库。在水库的大坝跟前立了一块纪念碑，人们给它起的名字就叫接官厅水库。从纪念碑的旁边沿着山根爬上一个陡坡，站在大坝上举目四望，在高耸的群山当中拦蓄着一片山水，用它可以灌溉二万多亩田地。去年到这里来修水库的人，前后一共有好几万。水库里原来就有许多鱼，公社成立以后，又把一万多条鱼秧放到里面去繁殖。现在水库里的水还冻结着一层厚厚的冰壳，因为怕鱼群会被冰壳闷死，在这里看管水库的社员从冰面上凿开好几个很大的冰洞。站在大坝上，忽然听见有什么声音在水底下嚎着，那声音是那样沈毅而又那样巨大，以致周围的群山都一起随着它轰响起来。是不是神话里所说的水妖在水底下呻吟？当然不是。去年曾经亲自目睹过的人们一定会想起来，那是大跃进的千军万马留下来的巨大的回声。那巨大的回声不仅在这里，也在工厂，在田间，在每一个大跃进的脚步踏过的地方留存下来，而且在新的途程上响起更巨大的回声……。
