Looking at five years from three years, three years from the first year, and each year from the previous winter. This is an important leadership method. All three sentences mean that we should seize the initiative at the beginning. If we seize the initiative at the beginning, the subsequent tasks will be easier; if we don't seize the initiative at the beginning, the subsequent tasks will be more difficult. According to this spirit, we must pay special attention to seizing the initiative at the beginning of the year. If we grasp the beginning of the year firmly, we will proceed firmly step by step, and we will be confident in fulfilling the annual plan.

Why is this? The reasons can be explained in two aspects. On the one hand, today has today's work, and tomorrow has tomorrow's work. The beginning of the year has the work of the beginning of the year, and the end of the year has the work of the end of the year. If today's work is not grasped tightly and cannot be completed, it will add an extra burden to tomorrow. If the work at the beginning of the year is not grasped tightly and cannot be completed, it will add an extra burden to the subsequent work. This goes without saying. On the other hand, tomorrow's work requires preparation today, and many problems in the second half of the year need to be arranged and resolved at the beginning of the year. If we don't prepare for tomorrow's work today, and don't prepare for the second half of the year at the beginning of the year, we will be "caught blind" when tomorrow comes, or when the second half of the year comes. Some comrades easily overlook this problem, but it cannot be overlooked. Our country has many such warnings: "Prepare in advance," "He who has no distant worries will have immediate troubles," "It's too late to mend the boat when it's in the middle of the river," etc., all reminding us from positive or negative perspectives that we must have foresight and act early. Experienced housewives prepare winter clothes for their children in the autumn. Experienced mountain climbers scout the route before climbing, grasp the weather information on the high mountains, and prepare climbing tools, clothing, and even oxygen. Experienced workers clean up machine tools and organize tools after work so that they can quickly start the machines the next day. Experienced leaders are good at looking ahead and behind, making overall arrangements, grasping the present, and seeing the future, so they are confident and win step by step.

Today, our newspaper published a news item about the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory. In addition to grasping the current production, the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory also foresees that the production tasks in the third and fourth quarters will increase more than twofold compared to the first quarter, and is taking measures to strive to increase the factory's production capacity more than twofold in the third quarter of this year to adapt to the needs of the developing situation. This is the leadership method of "looking at the whole year from the beginning of the year." This leadership method of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory has universal significance. Because the production tasks in the third and fourth quarters are greater than in the first quarter, it is not an isolated phenomenon of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory. Work is always developing day by day, and in our work arrangements, we always ask to do more work today than yesterday, and more work tomorrow than today, according to this developing situation. Therefore, the production tasks in the third and fourth quarters of enterprises are often much heavier than in the first quarter. This is an objective trend. This trend requires us to grasp the current work while also looking ahead to the next step and making preparations for the next step as early as possible.

Some comrades lack this foresight. They only grasp the current production and do not see the next step of production that is coming soon. Grasping the current production is absolutely correct; but if there is no consideration for the next step of production, it is difficult to achieve a complete victory for the whole year. It's like a mountain climber who is climbing very well now, but if he doesn't estimate or prepare for the icy and snowy conditions and thin air on the top of the mountain, it will be difficult to move forward in the end. Of course, there are also some other people who only see that the tasks in the third and fourth quarters are heavier than in the first quarter, and the tasks in the later stage are heavier than in the earlier stage, and say that "there is no problem with the current production, the problem is in the future," so they relax the current production. This is of course also wrong. At any time, grasping the current production is the main thing; only when the current production is grasped well can we talk about preparing for the next step of production. If we only look at the next step and ignore the current production, it is like a mountain climber who only sees how it is on the top of the mountain but does not pay attention to how to walk the road in front of him, and will also take a detour.

Looking at the whole year from the beginning of the year, and seizing the initiative at the beginning, requires us to grasp the current production and make arrangements for the next step of production in advance; with grasping the current production as the main thing. From the perspective of each enterprise, grasping the production in the first quarter is particularly important, but the arrangement of the next step of production cannot be ignored. Neither should be neglected, and the importance should not be reversed.

    全年看年初
    吴滤
    “五年看三年，三年看头年，每年看前冬”。这是一个重要的领导方法。这三句话的意思都是说一开头就要抓紧。开头抓紧了，以后的事情就比较好办；开头没有抓紧，以后的事情就比较难办。根据这个精神，到了一年开始的时候，特别要抓紧。年初抓得紧，以后步步紧，全年的计划就很有把握。
    这是为什么呢？道理可以分两方面来讲。一方面，今天有今天的工作，明天有明天的工作。年初有年初的工作，年末有年末的工作。今天的工作抓得不紧，不能做完，就得明天增加了额外的负担。年初的工作抓得不紧，不能做完，就给以后的工作增加了额外的负担。这是不用多说的。另一方面，明天的工作又需要今天预做准备，后半年的工作也有许多问题需要年初就安排解决。今天不准备明天的工作，年初不准备后半年的工作，到了明天，到了后半年，就要“抓瞎”。有些同志容易忽视这个问题，其实却忽视不得的。我国有许多这样的警语：“未雨绸缪”、“人无远虑，必有近忧”、“船到江中补漏迟”等等，都是从正面或反面提醒我们，做事情要有预见，要早动手。有经验的主妇秋天就为孩子们准备冬衣。有经验的爬山运动员，登山之前先要侦察道路，掌握高山上的气象资料，准备好爬山的工具，服装、甚至氧气等等。有经验的工人，下班之后还要收拾机床、整理工具，以便第二天一上班，就能迅速开动机器。有经验的领导者都善于瞻前顾后，统筹安排，既抓紧现在，又看到将来，因而胸有成竹，步步得胜。
    今天本报发表了上海机床厂的一条新闻。上海机床厂除了抓紧当前的生产以外，还预见到第三季度和第四季度的生产任务都将比第一季度增长两倍以上，正采取措施力争在今年第三季度内把全厂的生产能力提高两倍以上，来适应形势发展的需要。这就是“全年看年初”的领导方法。上海机床厂的这种领导方法，很有普遍意义。因为第三季度和第四季度的生产任务大于第一季度，并不是上海机床厂的个别的现象。工作总是一天天发展的，我们在工作的安排上也总是根据这种发展的形势，要求今天比昨天做更多的工作，明天又比今天做更多的工作，因而企业里第三季度和第四季度的生产任务，常常会比第一季度繁重得多。这是一种客观趋势。这种趋势要求我们在抓紧当前工作的同时，还要看到下一步，为下一步的工作早作准备。
    有些同志缺乏这种预见。他们只抓当前的生产，没有看到紧跟着就要来到的下一步的生产。抓紧当前的生产，这是万分正确的；但对下一步的生产没有考虑，却难取得全年的胜利。好比爬山运动员，现在爬得很好，但对于山顶上冰天雪地，空气稀薄的情况没有估计，没有准备，到了最后就很难前进。当然，也还有另一种人，他们只看到第三季度和第四季度的任务比第一季度重，后期的任务比前期重，说什么“眼前的生产没有问题，问题在以后”，因而放松了当前的生产。这当然也是不对的。任何时期，抓紧当前的生产都是主要的；只有当前的生产抓好了，才谈得到为下一步的生产作准备。如果只去看下一步，忽视当前的生产，就好像爬山运动员只看到山顶上如何如何，却不注意眼前的路应该怎样走，也是会走弯路的。
    全年看年初，一开头就抓紧，要求我们既抓紧当前的生产，又为下一步的生产预作安排；以抓紧当前的生产为主，从每个企业来说，抓紧第一季度的生产特别重要，但也不可忽视下一步生产的安排。两者不可偏废，轻重也不可倒置。
