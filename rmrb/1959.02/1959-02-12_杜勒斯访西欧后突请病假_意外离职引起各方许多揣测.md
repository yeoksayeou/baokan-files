Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 10th: After completing a "lightning" trip to Western Europe, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles returned to Washington on the 9th and suddenly requested a leave of absence from Eisenhower that evening, reportedly to undergo a hernia operation and "restore his strength."

The news was announced shortly after the 71-year-old Dulles reported the results of his Western European visit to Eisenhower. White House Press Secretary Hagerty released the full text of Dulles' letter to Eisenhower.

In the letter, Dulles stated that he needed to undergo a hernia operation and would require "several weeks to regain his strength, and (needed) some time to shed other responsibilities to focus on studying the complex and serious issues raised by the Soviet threat to Berlin and the allied response."

Dulles requested that the duties of Secretary of State be temporarily handed over to Under Secretary Herter, or to Assistant Secretary Dillon during Herter's absence.

The news said that Eisenhower had approved Dulles' leave of absence.

This "unexpected" leave of absence by Dulles has caused considerable speculation in Washington. Some diplomatic observers are predicting whether Dulles' departure will become more prolonged. Associated Press reporter Scali said that Dulles' illness had cast "a shadow" over the entire Western plan to deal with Soviet proposals on the German question.

Upon returning to Washington from Western Europe, Dulles issued a statement briefly discussing his trip. He said that he had "discussed the entire German question" with the British, French, and West German governments and "exchanged views on the prospects for a foreign ministers' conference with the Soviet Union." He said that they also discussed the "serious situation" in Berlin and unanimously "disagreed" with the Soviet Union's transfer of control over traffic from West Germany to West Berlin to the government of the German Democratic Republic, and were "determined to maintain our (Western) position in West Berlin and access to West Berlin." Dulles stated that the West had reached a "general agreement on the actions we will take if anyone uses practical means to interfere with our rights in this regard." However, according to Western news agencies, after Dulles' "lightning" trip, differences of opinion still exist within the West on this issue and on the entire approach to the German question.

Dulles was admitted to Walter Reed Army Hospital today.

    杜勒斯访西欧后突请病假
    意外离职引起各方许多揣测
    新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在结束去西欧的“闪电”旅行于9日回到华盛顿后，突然在当天晚间向艾森豪威尔提出请假一个时期的要求，据说是为了动一次疝气手术，并且进行“恢复体力”的休养。
    这个消息是七十一岁的杜勒斯在向艾森豪威尔报告了西欧访问结果之后不久宣布的。白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂公布了杜勒斯给艾森豪威尔的信件全文。
    杜勒斯在这封信中说，他要动一次疝气手术，并且需要“几个星期的时间来恢复体力，而且（需要）有一些时间摆脱其他责任以集中力量研究苏联关于柏林的威胁，引起的复杂和严重的问题和盟国的对策”。
    杜勒斯请求把国务卿的职务暂时交给副国务卿赫脱，或者在赫脱离职期间交给副国务卿帮办狄龙。
    消息说，艾森豪威尔已经批准杜勒斯的请假。
    杜勒斯这次被称为“出人意料”的请假事件在华盛顿引起了不少揣测。一些外交观察家们在预言杜勒斯离职的时间是不是会变得比较长。美联社记者斯卡利说，杜勒斯的病使得西方目前在德国问题上拟订应付苏联建议的整个计划“蒙上一层暗影”。
    杜勒斯在刚从西欧回到华盛顿时发表了一项声明，简短地谈到他的西欧之行。他说，他同英、法和西德政府“讨论了整个德国问题”，并且“就同苏联举行外长会议的前景交换了意见”。他说，他们还交谈了柏林的“严重局势”，并且一致“不同意”苏联把从西德进入西柏林的交通的管理权移交给德意志民主共和国政府，而“决心保持我们（西方）在西柏林的地位和到西柏林去的通道”。杜勒斯表示，西方已经就“如果有人使用实际手段来干涉我们在这方面的权利时，我们所将采取的行动取得一般协议”，但是，据西方通讯社透露，在杜勒斯这次“闪电”旅行后，西方在这个问题上以及在整个德国问题的对付方法上，仍然存在意见分歧。
    杜勒斯已经在今天进华尔特·里德陆军医院。
