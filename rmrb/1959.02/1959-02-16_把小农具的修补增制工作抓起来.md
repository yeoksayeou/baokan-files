    Grasp the Repair and Production of Small Farm Tools
    The Spring Festival is over, and the tense season of spring plowing and planting is approaching. In order to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production this year, people's communes in various regions have launched a high tide of fertilizer accumulation and production and are actively carrying out various preparations for spring plowing and planting.
    "If a workman wishes to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools." In order to guarantee the victory of spring plowing and lay a solid foundation for a greater leap forward, what problems should be solved in the tool reform movement? According to recent reports from some areas, there is a great shortage of many small farm tools necessary for spring plowing and planting, such as hoes, sickles, spades, and mattocks in various places. Some need to be repaired, and some need to be supplemented. All localities should pay attention to this as soon as possible and organize forces to immediately start repairing and supplementing small farm tools. A slight delay will inevitably cause difficulties.
    The shortage of small farm tools is a phenomenon that occurs every year. Therefore, various farm tool repairs and replacements are carried out in rural areas every year. Last year was a year of great leap forward in agricultural production, and the utilization rate of all farm tools was higher than in any previous year, and the depreciation and damage rate was of course greater than in previous years. Last autumn and winter, a large number of iron and woodworking craftsmen participated in steelmaking and ironmaking, and in some places the production of small farm tools was once reduced. In addition, the majority of women participated in production, and the labor force has been unprecedentedly expanded, and the demand for small farm tools has greatly increased. All these reasons added together have made the shortage of small farm tools even more prominent.
    This year is a decisive year for the three years of hard work. To complete 1050 billion catties of grain and 100 million dan of cotton, as well as a comprehensive and greater leap forward in oil, hemp, tea, silk, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, a lot of work needs to be done. Preparing the means of production is an important task. All small farm tools must be sorted out and added to ensure the needs of fertilizer accumulation, wheat field management, spring plowing, spring planting, summer harvesting, summer planting, and the completion of the annual production tasks. The most urgent task at present is to conduct a comprehensive inspection by commune and by team to find out the real situation, how many usable small farm tools are left, and how many damaged ones need to be repaired and equipped. First, add and repair the farm tools needed for the current fertilizer accumulation campaign and wheat field management, as well as the upcoming spring plowing and sowing, and summer harvest and planting, and then, according to the annual production plan of the team and commune, formulate a plan for repairing and adding small farm tools, and immediately organize the iron and woodworking craftsmen and small kilns to repair and add small farm tools in batches and in stages.
    In the repair and manufacture of small farm tools, it is necessary to emphasize both quality and quantity, and to ensure that the repaired and manufactured small farm tools are not only sufficient, but also all easy to use and durable. It is necessary to promote the cherishing of tools. Each production team should have a special person to manage the farm tools, and some small farm tools should be used and managed by the members themselves. Small farm tools are indispensable tools in production. If they are in short supply and incomplete, not only will people be unable to work, but many farm jobs cannot be carried out, which will cause delays for both people and work. The view of looking down on or not paying attention to small farm tools and relaxing the repair, equipping, and supplementing of small farm tools is incorrect. Small farm tools are needed at all times. Even if agricultural mechanization is realized in the future, manual labor and small farm tools will still be needed to do many small jobs that machines cannot do.
    Time is very pressing. The wheat has already begun to turn green, and spring plowing and planting will begin soon. All localities should seize the time and quickly replenish the missing small farm tools and repair the damaged small farm tools. Short commentary

    把小农具的修补增制工作抓起来
    春节已过，紧张的春耕春种季节就要到了，各地人民公社为着争取今年农业生产更大、更好、更全面的跃进，已经掀起了积肥造肥运动的高潮，并积极地进行着春耕春种的各项准备工作。
    “工欲善其事，必先利其器”，为了保证春耕工作的胜利，给更大跃进打下坚实的基础，在工具改革运动中，要解决一些什么问题呢？根据最近一部分地区反映的情况，许多春耕春种必需的小农具如锄、镰、锨、镢等各地都缺少很多，有的需要修理，有的需要补充，各地应该及早引起注意，组织力量立即着手对小农具的整修和增补。稍一迟缓，必将造成困难。
    小农具缺少的现象，是年年都有的。因此农村中每年都要进行各种农具的整修和添置工作，去年是农业生产大跃进的一年，所有农具利用率都比过去任何一年高，折旧损坏率当然也会比往年大。去年秋冬季，铁木工匠大批参加炼钢炼铁，有些地方小农具的生产一度减少，加上广大妇女大都参加了生产，劳动队伍有了空前的扩大，小农具需要数量也大大增加了，这种种原因加到一起，就使得小农具缺乏的情况更加突出了。
    今年是苦战三年的决定性的一年，要完成一万零五百亿斤粮食和一亿担棉花，以及油、麻、茶、丝和林、牧、副、渔的全面更大跃进，要作很多工作。把生产工具准备齐全是其中一项重要的任务。要把小农具全部整理好和添置足以保证积肥运动、麦田管理、春耕、春种、夏收夏种以及完成全年生产任务的需要。当前最紧要的工作是要按社、按队进行全面的检查，摸清底子，到底还有多少能用的小农具，有多少损坏了的需要修配；首先把当前积肥运动和麦田管理以及即将到来的春耕春播、夏收夏种所需要的农具，增添修配起来，然后再根据本队本社的全年生产计划，订出一个修理、增添小农具的规划，并立即把铁木工匠和小烘炉组织起来，分批分期把小农具修配和增补起来。
    在修理和制造小农具中，必须强调质量和数量并重，要保证修理和制造出来的小农具不仅够用，而且件件好用耐用。要提倡爱惜工具，各生产队应有专人作农具保管工作，有些小农具应由社员自用自管。小农具都是生产上不可缺少的工具，如果短缺不全，不仅人要窝工，很多农活也不能进行，就会造成人、活两耽误。看不起或不重视小农具的观点和放松对小农具的修配、补充工作是不对的。小农具任何时候都是需要的，即使将来实现了农业机械化，也还需要手工劳动和小农具来作机器所不能作的许多小活路。
    时间已很紧迫，麦子已经开始返青，春耕春种工作很快也要开始，各地应该抓紧时间，赶快把缺少的小农具补充起来，把损坏了的小农具修理好。短评
