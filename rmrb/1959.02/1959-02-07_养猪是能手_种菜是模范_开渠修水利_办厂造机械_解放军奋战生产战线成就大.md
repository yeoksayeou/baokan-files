    Xinhua News Agency, 5th -- In 1958, the land, sea, and air forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with their diligent hands, used existing land and technical equipment to engage in industrial and agricultural production, achieving brilliant results in both ideological and production aspects.

    In this year, the PLA units achieved a great increase of more than double the production of 1957 in agricultural and sideline production, mainly in vegetable growing and pig raising. According to incomplete statistics, last year the units planted a total of more than 260,000 mu of vegetables and various crops, harvesting more than 419 million jin of various vegetables, more than 26.9 million jin of grain, and more than 27.4 million jin of economic crops. In addition to slaughtering pigs, cattle, sheep, poultry, etc., which amounted to more than 18.3 million jin of meat, there are currently more than 420,000 pigs, more than 80,000 cattle and sheep, more than 140,000 poultry, and more than 5 million fish. As a result of the hard work of the vast number of officers and soldiers, the supply of meat has increased significantly. Many units have achieved complete or largely self-sufficiency in vegetables, and some units have also supported fraternal units or supplied the local market with the surplus.

    In the course of agricultural and sideline production, the vast number of officers and soldiers, with their infinite wisdom and hard work, have created miracles of vegetable harvest in many plateau areas and saline-alkali lands where crops do not grow all year round. In the Tibetan plateau area, which is more than 4,000 meters above sea level, the soil layer is thin, the climate is erratic, and there are only three or four months of frost-free period throughout the year, making it difficult for crops to grow. However, the troops stationed in these areas, last year, under the slogan of "not afraid of high mountains and cold climate, we must grow green vegetables," overcame various difficulties, so that the average yield of vegetables per mu reached 4,700 jin, and the highest yield per mu reached 15,000 jin, the whole region achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables, and also stored one million jin. In the Maling area of Hainan Island, the climate is dry and hot, there are many typhoons, and the land is barren. The troops stationed in this area also broke the routine last year and planted dozens of kinds of vegetables. They built walls to block typhoons and built racks to shield the sun, so that all kinds of vegetables grew very well.

    In this year, all units and schools of the PLA with technical equipment, on the premise of ensuring the completion of military training tasks and teaching tasks, also strived to give full play to the utilization rate of existing machinery and equipment, carried out industrial production, and undertook the production tasks of some local processing orders, repairs and manufacturing of civilian products. Last year, the army built more than 3,300 factories on its own and in cooperation with local authorities. Among them, there are 187 steel plants, 469 iron plants, 315 machinery plants, 199 fertilizer plants, and 91 cement plants. Last year alone, machinery factories and fertilizer factories produced 4,854 machine tools, 687 tractors, 2,465 power machines, and more than 13,200 tons of chemical fertilizers. In addition, the flour mills, sauce making, and bean processing workshops run by the troops themselves have also played a good role in enriching the supply of non-staple food for the troops.

    解放军奋战生产战线成就大
    新华社5日讯　1958年，中国人民解放军陆、海、空三军，以勤劳的双手，利用现有的土地和技术设备，从事工农业生产，获得了思想生产双丰收的辉煌成绩。
    这一年，人民解放军各部队在以种菜、养猪为主要项目的农副业生产中，取得了比1957年增产一番的巨大成绩。据不完全统计，去年全年各部队共种植蔬菜和各种作物二十六万多亩，收获各种蔬菜四亿一千九百多万斤，谷物二千六百九十多万斤，经济作物二千七百四十多万斤，除已宰杀猪、牛、羊、家禽等折肉一千八百三十多万斤外，目前还有猪四十二万多头，牛羊八万多头，家禽十四万多只，鱼五百多万条。广大官兵辛勤劳动的结果，肉食供应量有了显著的增加，许多部队已达到蔬菜全部或大部自给，有些部队还把有余的部分支援了兄弟部队或供应了当地市场。
    在进行农副业生产中，广大官兵以无穷的智慧和辛勤的劳动，在许多常年不长农作物的高原地区和盐碱地里，也创造了蔬菜丰收的奇迹。拔海四千公尺以上的西藏高原地区，土层薄，气候变化无常，全年仅有三、四个月无霜期，农作物生长很困难。但是，驻在这些地区的部队，去年在“不怕山高气候冷，硬要青菜长出来”的口号下，战胜了种种困难，使每亩蔬菜平均产量达到四千七百斤，最高亩产达一万五千斤，全区实现了蔬菜自给，还储存了一百万斤，海南岛马岭地区，气候干燥酷热，台风多，土地瘠薄，驻守在这个地区的部队，去年也打破常规，种植了数十种蔬菜。他们筑墙挡台风，搭架子遮太阳，使各种蔬菜都生长得很好。
    这一年，解放军各部队、学校等一切具有技术设备的单位，在保证完成军事训练任务和教学任务的前提下，还努力发挥现有机械设备的利用率，进行了工业生产，承担了地方上一部分加工订货、修理制造等民用产品的生产任务。全军去年自己兴建和与地方合建的工厂共有三千三百多座。其中，炼钢厂一百八十七座、炼铁厂四百六十九座、机械厂三百一十五座、化肥厂一百九十九座、水泥厂九十一座。仅机械厂和化肥厂去年就生产了四千八百五十四台机床，六百八十七台拖拉机，二千四百六十五台动力机械和一万三千二百多吨化学肥料。此外，各部队自办的制粉、造酱、豆类加工等作坊，对丰富部队副食品的供应，也起了良好的作用。
