    Ode to Printed Fabric
    Shaanxi  Tian Tian Shi
    Painted by: Miao Yin Tang
        Could it be neon lights before my eyes?
        The colorful splendor dazzles.
        If you ask where spring is,
        Flowers on the fabric compete in beauty.
        The printing and dyeing workers are truly extraordinary,
        The ingenious craftsmanship makes the colors unchanging.
        Cut the printed fabric and sew clothes,
        The girl wears spring on her.

    花布赞
    陕西  田天诗
    缪印　堂　画莫非霓虹现眼前？五彩缤纷耀目眩。若问春天何所在？布面百花齐争艳。印染工人真不凡，巧夺天工色不变。剪裁花布缝衣衫，姑娘身上是春天。（附图片）
