    Such a "Clean Official"
    When Nobusuke Kishi came to power, he once raised the banner of "eliminating three evils," one of which was corruption and bribery. At that time, Nobusuke Kishi put on such a facade that he not only looked like a "great clean official," but also a capable hand at "eliminating three evils." But this hypocritical prime minister's hands were not clean after all.
    According to a report by the Japanese "Akahata Newspaper" on February 13th this year, Nobusuke Kishi received a "gift" (60 million yen in cash) from the Tokyo Kinoshita Store, and accepted approximately 20 million yen in bribes from Itochu Corporation, the Japanese agent for the American Grumman Aircraft Company. The "Japan Economic News" also mentioned that Kinoshita Store obtained huge profits in the payment of reparations materials to Indonesia through behind-the-scenes deals with politicians.
    Nobusuke Kishi is known in Japan for his cunning tricks, and people gave him the nickname "the person without seams," meaning he won't make mistakes. However, no matter how cunning Nobusuke Kishi is, he cannot cover up his dirty hands.

### 如此“清官”

    如此“清官”
    岸信介上台时曾经打出一个“除三害”的幌子，其中有一害就是贪污受贿。当时岸信介摆出的那副架势，不仅俨然像个“大清官”，而且还是“除三害”的能手。可是这个装模作样的堂堂首相的一双手原来也并不干净。
    据今年2月13日日本“赤旗报”揭露，岸信介从东京木下商店接收了一份“礼物”（六千万日元的钞票），又从美国格鲁门飞机公司在日本的代理机构伊藤忠商事公司接受了大约二千万日元的贿赂。“日本经济新闻”也提到木下商店由于和政客们进行了幕后交易而在对印度尼西亚支付赔偿物资中取得暴利。
    岸信介在日本以善于耍狡猾伎俩著称，人们送他一个别号叫做“没有缝子的人”，即不会出漏子之意。但是，岸信介再狡猾也遮不住他的肮脏的双手。
