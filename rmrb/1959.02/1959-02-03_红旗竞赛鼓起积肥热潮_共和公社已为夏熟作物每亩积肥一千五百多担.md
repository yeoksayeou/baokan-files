Red Flag Competition Spurs Manure Accumulation Craze
Gonghe Commune Has Accumulated Over 1,500 Dan of Manure per Mu for Summer Crops

    (Our Dispatch) The Gonghe People's Commune in Lishui County, Jiangsu Province, using the method of launching a mass movement, has continuously organized three mass-scale campaigns to accumulate manure. They have now accumulated enough topdressing fertilizer for all summer crops. They plan to organize two more mass manure accumulation battles around the Spring Festival to store enough base fertilizer for this year's spring planting and summer crops.
    Like last year's nationwide steelmaking campaign, from commune cadres at all levels to all commune members, from the elderly in their sixties and seventies to children in their teens, men and women, young and old, have all thrown themselves into the heated battle of accumulating manure. Xue Lin, the First Secretary of the Party Committee, is the direct commander of this major campaign. Experienced old farmers in manure accumulation have been hired as "manure accumulation advisors." Commune cadres led the masses, finding more than a dozen kinds of fertilizer sources from the mountains, ditches, fields, roadsides, and around houses that had not been utilized for many years. With so many fertilizer sources, the masses were even more encouraged to engage in large-scale manure accumulation and fertilizer production. The Commune Party Committee adopted the method of "dividing troops for combat," organizing labor to carry out the manure accumulation movement. Young and strong lads are the main force on the manure accumulation front, breaking open the ice and draining the accumulated water in the rivers and ponds, digging up the rotten and smelly river mud with shovels one after another. Those women who are accustomed to walking on the small mountain paths carry loads of fertilizer to the fields in a continuous stream. The students of the Gonghe Commune Agricultural Middle School, although young, are very energetic. Under the leadership of their teachers, they cooperate with the commune members to shovel sod on the ridges of every wheat field and green manure field, piling up mounds of soil to create smoked soil fertilizer. The elderly are also ambitious, saying: Let the young people do the heavy work; we will still take care of collecting manure. They carry manure baskets, searching for manure from every village to every water conservancy construction site, from the main road to the field ridges. Two old men, Chen Xizhi and Wang Kuanghong, collected more than 310 jin of human and animal manure in one day. In the entire commune, among the fifty-seven production teams, each team has two or three old farmers specifically in charge of collecting manure. Preliminary statistics show that from last December to now, more than 150 old manure collectors in the whole commune have collected a total of 7,500 dan of dry human and animal manure. In this manure accumulation battle, every government worker, school teacher, and store clerk has been assigned specific manure accumulation tasks. Their slogan is: "Work hard and cleverly, complete fourteen dan before the Spring Festival."
    "Accumulating manure is like accumulating grain; sufficient fertilizer means a full granary. Compare fertilizer piles now, compare granaries in the summer harvest," "Not afraid of rain, slippery mountain roads, not afraid of frozen ground and cold weather, wherever there is fertilizer, we will work there." These are the battle slogans in the manure accumulation battle in the Gonghe Commune. The Commune Party Committee used methods such as carrying out Red Flag competitions and selecting manure accumulation models to rapidly push the manure accumulation movement to a climax. A Red Flag competition for manure accumulation was launched between the major brigades, between the production teams, between shock teams, and between commune members. The content of the competition is to compare drive, compare quantity, compare quality, compare speed, and compare methods. Active elements in the manure accumulation movement are awarded the title of manure accumulation model for the whole township through evaluation and given material rewards. In the three mass manure accumulation campaigns, more than fifty Red Flag production teams and more than one hundred first, second, and third-class manure accumulation models emerged in the whole commune. Many production teams and commune members have won the honorary titles of Red Flag team and manure accumulation model twice or three times in a row. For example, Tang Fugeng, the Party Branch Secretary of Yuancun Brigade, who won the title of first-class manure accumulation model in the whole township, personally led the masses, not afraid of the cold weather, and went up the mountains and down to the ponds to engage in manure accumulation, making the manure accumulation of the entire brigade large, fast, and good. Manure accumulation models Fang Yulan and two other female commune members accumulated more than 30,000 dan of various fertilizers in the seven days of the first campaign. The Red Flag competition promoted the enthusiasm of production teams and commune members where manure accumulation progress was slow. For example, the nine production teams, including Tianchong and Xinlangtou, which did not complete their tasks well in the first manure accumulation campaign, won the Red Flag in the second manure accumulation campaign. For the Red Flag teams and model figures selected in each campaign, the commune's cultural troupe compiled their model deeds into clapper talks, drum lyrics, and local operas, which were composed and sung on the spot and promoted everywhere. The cultural station also painted portraits of each manure accumulation model and paraded them through the villages with gongs and drums to promote them. In the manure accumulation battle, the entire Gonghe Commune was filled with an atmosphere of "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced." Wherever the masses had great enthusiasm, wherever there were many manure accumulation methods, and wherever the fertilizer was large, good, and fast, the commune held on-site meetings there.
    The three mass manure accumulation campaigns organized by the Gonghe Commune in succession have achieved brilliant results. According to statistics, a total of more than 11 million dan of various fine and coarse fertilizers have been accumulated, including 6.38 million dan of grass pile pond mud, 470,000 dan of river mud, 2.96 million dan of smoked soil, 380,000 dan of human and animal manure, and 1.37 million dan of miscellaneous fertilizer. The average summer crop in the whole commune has 1,562 dan of various fine and coarse fertilizers per mu.
    All summer crops in the Gonghe Commune have generally been topdressed twice. They plan to universally apply a winter fertilizer once more before the Spring Festival, and after the Spring Festival, continue to apply spring fertilizer according to the principle of "watching the seedlings and promoting growth." At present, the 7,400 mu of wheat seedlings and 6,900 mu of green manure seedlings in the whole commune are growing well. The vast number of cadres and masses in the whole commune continue to carry forward the spirit of hard work, practical work, and clever work, vigorously engage in manure accumulation and fertilizer production, greatly strengthen the field management of summer crops, and strive to achieve the great task of producing 1,000 jin per mu of three wheat crops and 10,000 jin per mu of green manure.

    红旗竞赛鼓起积肥热潮
    共和公社已为夏熟作物每亩积肥一千五百多担
    本报讯　江苏溧水县共和人民公社，用大搞群众运动的办法，连续组织了三次群众性突击积肥高潮。现已积足了全部夏熟作物的追肥。他们计划在春节前后，再组织两次群众性积肥大战，为今年春种和夏熟作物储足基肥。
    像去年全民炼钢铁运动一样，从公社各级干部，到全体社员，上至六、七十岁老人，下至十几岁的儿童，男女老幼都投入了热火朝天的积肥大突击战。党委第一书记薛林是这场大突击战的直接指挥官。对积肥有经验的老农，被聘请为“积肥参谋”。公社干部带领广大群众，从山里、河沟里、田头、路旁、家前屋后，找出了十多种多年来没有被利用过的肥源。有了这许多肥源，更鼓舞了群众大搞积肥造肥的信心。公社党委采取“分军作战”的方法，组织劳力开展积肥运动。年青力壮的小伙子们，是积肥战线上的主力部队，他们敲开冰冻，车干河塘里的积水，把沤得发黑发臭的河泥，一锹锹挖上来。那些走惯山区小路的妇女们，把一担担肥料，川流不息地挑往田里。共和公社农业中学的学生们，年纪虽小，干劲很大，他们在老师带领下，配合公社社员，在每一块麦田和绿肥田的田埂上，就地铲起了草皮，排排堆起了一个个土堆，大搞熏土造肥。老年人也雄心勃勃，他们说：重活让青年人干，拾粪还要看看我们的。他们背起了粪筐，从每一个村庄到每一个水利工地，从大路走到田埂上，到处在找粪。陈锡志、王匡洪两位老爹爹，一天就拾了三百十多斤人畜粪。像这样专管拾粪的老农，全公社五十七个生产队，每队都有二、三人。初步统计，从去年12月到现在，全社一百五十多个拾粪老农，共拾了七千五百担人畜干粪。在这场积肥大战中，每个机关干部、学校教师、商店营业员，都分配了具体的积肥任务，他们的口号是：“苦干加巧干，春节前完成十四担”。
    “积肥如积粮，肥足粮满仓，现在比肥堆，夏收比粮仓”、“不怕雨淋山路滑，不怕地冻天寒，那里有肥料，就到那里干”。这是共和公社积肥大战中的战斗口号。公社党委用开展红旗竞赛评选积肥模范等办法，把积肥运动迅速推向高潮。各大队之间、各生产队之间，突击队与突击队之间，社员与社员之间展开了积肥红旗竞赛。竞赛的内容是比干劲，比数量，比质量，比速度，比办法。对积肥运动中的积极分子，通过评比，授予全乡积肥模范称号，并给物质奖励。在三次群众性的突击积肥大战中，全公社共涌现出了五十多个积肥红旗生产队，一、二、三等积肥模范一百多个。好多生产队和社员，连续两次三次地获得积肥红旗队和积肥模范的光荣称号。如获得全乡一等积肥模范称号的袁村大队党支部书记唐富根，亲自带领群众，不怕天寒地冻，上山下塘搞积肥。使全大队积肥搞得又多又快又好。积肥模范方玉兰等三个女社员，在第一战役的七天中，积造了各种肥料三万多担。红旗竞赛推动了积肥进展不快的生产队和社员的积极性。如在第一次积肥大突击战中任务完成得不好的田冲、新郎头等九个生产队，在第二次积肥大突击战中，都夺得了红旗。对每次突击战中评选出来的红旗队和模范人物，公社文工团把他们的模范事迹编了快板、鼓词和地方剧，随编随唱，到处宣扬。文化站还把每个积肥模范都画了像，敲锣打鼓到各个村庄上去宣传。在积肥大战中，整个共和公社充满了“学先进、赶先进、超先进”的气氛。那里群众干劲大，那里积肥办法多，那里肥料搞得又多又好，公社就在那里召开现场会议。
    共和公社连续组织的三次群众性突击积肥大战，取得了辉煌的战果。据统计，共积造各种精、粗肥料一千一百多万担，其中草堆塘泥六百三十八万担，河泥四十七万担，熏土二百九十六万担，人畜粪三十八万担，杂肥一百三十七万担。全社夏熟作物平均每亩有各种精粗肥一千五百六十二担。
    共和公社的全部夏熟作物，已普遍施了两遍追肥。他们打算在春节前再普遍追施一次腊肥，春节以后，根据“看苗促进”的原则，再继续追施春肥。现在，这个公社七千四百亩麦苗和六千九百亩绿肥苗生长良好。全社广大干部和群众继续发扬苦干、实干、巧干的精神，大搞积肥造肥，大大加强夏熟作物的田间管理，争取实现三麦亩产千斤，绿肥亩产万斤的伟大任务。
