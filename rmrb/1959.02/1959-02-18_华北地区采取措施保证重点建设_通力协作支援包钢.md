North China Region Takes Measures to Guarantee Key Construction Projects
Working Together to Support Baotou Steel

(Dispatch from our newspaper) The leaders of Hebei Province, Shanxi Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Beijing Municipality in the North China region recently held a meeting in Beijing to discuss strengthening support for the construction of the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex.

The meeting considered that striving to put Baotou Steel into partial production as early as possible and complete its overall construction ahead of schedule would play an important role in accelerating China's socialist construction. In the past, all relevant regions, departments, and enterprises across the country have made great contributions to supporting the construction of Baotou Steel. However, this year is the decisive year for Baotou Steel to complete the first phase of its construction project. Its construction workload and engineering projects will be twice as large as last year, and it will be put into production ahead of schedule. Therefore, it is even more necessary to have the support of the whole country, especially the strong support of the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in North China. The resolution requires that the relevant departments and affiliated enterprises of the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in the North China region must place the task of supporting Baotou Steel in a primary position, and stipulates four measures:

First, the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in the North China region must ensure the completion of the materials and equipment uniformly arranged and allocated by the central government according to the plan. At the same time, they must do their best to prioritize the processing and manufacturing of non-standard equipment needed for the production and construction of Baotou Steel.

Second, the commercial departments of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, especially Baotou City, should include the market supply materials needed for the production and construction of Baotou Steel in their commercial plans and make every effort to organize the supply. For market materials that are not uniformly allocated nationwide, if the Inner Mongolia region is indeed unable to supply them, the commercial departments of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will uniformly organize external procurement. The commercial departments of the provinces and cities in North China, especially Tianjin, Beijing, and Taiyuan, should provide strong support for this and give priority to supply.

Third, Baotou City should successively establish some enterprises needed to serve the production and construction of Baotou Steel. The provinces and cities in the North China region should provide as much support as possible in terms of technology and equipment. When necessary, some small enterprises and handicraft cooperatives of this nature in large cities such as Tianjin and Beijing, which can be relocated, can be moved to Baotou.

Fourth, the Economic Planning Office is responsible for making the organization of support for the construction of Baotou Steel an important task, regularly understanding the construction situation and major problems of Baotou Steel, and assisting Baotou Steel in organizing and solving some problems that need to be coordinated within the North China region. The planning commissions of the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in North China should check the work of supporting the construction of Baotou Steel once every quarter.

    华北地区采取措施保证重点建设
    通力协作支援包钢
    本报讯　华北地区的河北省、山西省、内蒙古自治区、北京市的负责人最近在北京开会，讨论了加强支援包头钢铁联合企业建设工作的问题。
    会议认为，争取包钢尽早地部分投入生产并提早全部建成，对加速我国社会主义建设将起重要作用。过去对包钢建设的支援，全国各有关地区、部门、企业都作了很大的贡献。但是包钢今年的建设是完成第一期建设工程的决定性的一年，它的建设工作量和工程项目将比去年大两倍，并且要提前投入生产。因此就更加需要全国的支援，首先是华北各省、市、自治区的大力支援。决议要求华北区各省、市、自治区有关部门和所属企业，必须把支援包钢的任务，摆在首要位置，并规定了四条办法：
    第一，华北区各省、市、自治区对于中央统一安排和调拨的物资、设备，必须按计划保证完成，同时对包钢生产建设所需的非标准设备，必须尽力优先加工承制。
    第二，包钢生产建设所需要的市场供应物资，内蒙古自治区特别是包头市的商业部门，要把它列入商业计划，全力组织供应，对于非全国统一调度的市场物资，如内蒙古区内确无力供应的，由内蒙古自治区商业部门统一组织对外采购。华北区各省、市特别是天津、北京、太原等城市的商业部门对此应力予支援，优先供应。
    第三，包头市应陆续建立一些为包钢生产建设服务所需的企业，华北区各省、市在技术上和设备上尽力予以支援。必要时天津、北京等大城市中属于这一类性质而又能够迁出的一部分小型企业和手工业合作社，可迁往包头。
    第四，责成经济计划办公厅把组织支援包钢建设的工作，作为自己的重要任务，经常了解包钢的建设情况和存在的重大问题，协助包钢组织、解决一些需要在华北区内进行协作的问题。华北各省、市、自治区计委应每季检查一次支援包钢建设的工作。
