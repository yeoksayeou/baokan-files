Xinjiang's Underground Mineral Resources are Rich and Colorful
Over 1,400 Mineral Sites Explored Last Year

(Our Newspaper's Dispatch) Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is full of treasures. In 1958, geological exploration personnel discovered more than 1,400 new mineral sites in various places, equivalent to twice the total number of mineral sites found during the first Five-Year Plan period.

The more than 1,400 mineral sites that have been found include more than 40 types of minerals such as iron, coal, and various non-ferrous and rare metals, and most of them have industrial mining value. Among them, there are 36 large and medium-sized mineral sites, and there are six iron ore sites with prospective reserves of about 100 million tons. A large hematite mine in Tuoli County in the northern Junggar Basin has reserves of 500 million to 1 billion tons; a copper mineralization zone about 32 kilometers long and 2 kilometers wide was discovered in the north of the Turpan Basin, with several copper ore outcrops. One outcrop is more than one kilometer long and more than 40 meters wide, with a copper content of more than 1%; in addition, large lead-zinc mines and coking coalfields of national significance have also been discovered in southern Xinjiang and the Hami area.

Many of the new mineral sites discovered in 1958 are located in areas where no mineral deposits had been discovered in the past, proving that Xinjiang's underground mineral resources are very rich. For example, the Kunlun Mountains, where very little geological work had been done in the past, have already discovered a large lead-zinc mine with a very high grade, rare in the country. The prospective reserves of pure lead are several million tons. An iron ore deposit discovered in the western part of the Kunlun Mountains has an iron content of about 60% and an estimated reserve of more than 100 million tons. In the Yemaquan area north of Xingxing Gorge, geologists have always believed that this area was covered by the Quaternary period and that large mines could not be found. Last year, after geologists criticized dogmatism and conservative thinking, they discovered a large coking coalfield here, with an estimated reserve of more than 120 million tons just within the outcrop range.

In the mass movement to promote geology, a strong geological team has been cultivated among the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. More than 15,000 people have initially mastered basic geological prospecting knowledge, and some of them have become technical backbones after practical prospecting and short-term study. Of the more than 1,400 mineral sites found in 1958, about 40% were found by mass geological teams or reported to the geological departments.

    新疆地下矿藏丰富多彩
    去年勘探出一千四百多处矿点
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区到处是宝，1958年地质勘探人员在各地新发现的矿点有一千四百多处，等于第一个五年计划期间找到矿点总和的两倍。
    已找到的一千四百多处矿点，包括铁、煤以及多种有色金属和稀有金属等四十多种，而且大部分都具有工业开采价值。其中属于大中型的矿点就有三十六处，光是远景储量在一亿吨左右的铁矿就有六处。准噶尔盆地北部托里县的一个大赤铁矿，储藏量在五到十亿吨；吐鲁番盆地北部发现了一个约三十二公里长，二公里宽的含铜矿化带中，有好几处铜矿露头，有一处露头有一公里多长，四十多公尺宽，含铜量在1％以上；此外，在南疆、哈密地区也都发现了具有全国意义的大铅锌矿和炼焦煤田。
    1958年新发现的矿点，有许多都在过去还没有发现过矿藏的地区，证明新疆地下矿藏十分丰富。如过去很少作过地质工作的昆仑山，已经发现了一处全国少有的品位很高的大型铅锌矿，纯铅的远景储量就有数百万吨。在昆仑山西部发现的一处铁矿，含铁量在60％左右，估计储量在一亿吨以上。在星星峡以北野马泉地区的大戈壁里，多年来地质人员一直认为这是第四纪掩盖地区找不到大矿，去年，地质人员批判了教条主义、保守思想以后，在这里发现了一处大型炼焦煤田，仅露头范围估计储量就在一亿二千万吨以上。
    在群众大办地质中，新疆各民族人民中已经培养出一支强大的地质队伍，有一万五千多人初步掌握了地质找矿常识，其中部分人实际找矿和短期学习后，已成为技术骨干。1958年找到的一千四百多处矿点，其中40％左右是由群众地质队伍找到或报告给地质部门的。
