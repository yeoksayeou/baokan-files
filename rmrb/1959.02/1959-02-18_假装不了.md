    After dragging on for more than a month, Western countries finally issued a reply to the Soviet Union on February 16, reiterating their opposition to the Soviet proposal to end the occupation status of West Berlin, while expressing their willingness to hold a four-power foreign ministers' conference. The West German Adenauer government's reply was full of pleasant and beautiful words, and stated: "For the peaceful coexistence of all peoples, it is extremely important to quickly resolve the German question reasonably through negotiations..."

    However, on the very same day that the West German government issued its note, Adenauer could not wait to come out and make trouble. He released information saying that the four foreign ministers' meeting "must be prepared for lengthy negotiations." He also used the Korean armistice and the Austrian State Treaty negotiations as examples, implying that the four-power negotiations would drag on for two years, or even hold more than a thousand meetings. Of course, under Adenauer's calculation of such a "marathon negotiation," the solution to the German question would not be known until what year or month.

    Adenauer's words exposed the West German government's hypocritical mask, proving how afraid he is of Germany's reunification and how afraid he is of the relaxation of the international situation.

    假装不了
    在拖了一个多月之后，西方国家在2月16日总算对苏联发出了复照，再次表示反对苏联关于结束西柏林占领状态的建议，同时表示愿意举行四国外长会议。西德阿登纳政府的复照，充满了不少好听的漂亮话，并且表示：“为了各国人民之间和平共处，尽速通过谈判方式合理解决德国问题……是极为重要的”。
    但是，就在西德政府发出照会的同一天，阿登纳就迫不急待地出来捣乱了。他放出空气说：四外长会议“必须准备进行长时间的谈判”。他还用朝鲜停战和对奥和约的谈判为例，暗示四大国谈判要拖上两年，甚至举行一千次以上的会议。当然在阿登纳的这种“马拉松谈判”的算盘下，德国问题的解决也就不知道拖到何年何月。
    阿登纳的话戳穿了西德政府照会的假面具。证明了他是多么害怕德国重新统一、害怕国际局势的缓和。
