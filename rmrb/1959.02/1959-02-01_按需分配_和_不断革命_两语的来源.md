    The Source of the Phrases "Distribution According to Need" and "Continuous Revolution"
     Lin Ling
    Editor's Note: In the article "Reflections on the Correct Translation of 'Distribution According to Labor, Distribution According to Need'" published by Comrade Lin Ling on this page on the 25th of last month, the author discussed the origin of the phrases "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need" and "Continuous Revolution." Recently, we have received letters from some readers who believe that what was said that time was not accurate enough. Now we are specially requesting the author to supplement as follows:
    The communist slogan "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need" became a fairly popular idiom in Europe very early on. Marx and Engels only used these two idioms; they were not originally "refined into concise slogans" by them. For example, the French Utopian socialist Étienne Cabet used the phrases "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need" in his "Voyage en Icarie," published in 1840. As for using similar statements to express the same idea, that was even earlier. For example, the Italian Utopian socialist Tommaso Campanella proposed in his "The City of the Sun," published as early as 1623, that "whatever one wants should be taken from society" and that "no one should receive more than they need." The French Utopian socialist Morelly said in his "Naufrage des Isles Flottantes, ou la Basiliade," published in 1753: "Work should be distributed according to people's abilities, and products should be distributed according to people's needs."
    If we trace it back further, there is a similar statement in the Christian Bible, "New Testament," in the "Acts of the Apostles" (written in the second and third centuries): "Distribution was made to each as any had need." The slogan of "Continuous Revolution" was also not first proposed by Blanqui's students in the 19th century. This idea had already been repeatedly proposed by revolutionaries during the French Revolution in the 18th century. The most prominent was Marat (1743-1793), who wrote many articles in his newspaper "L'Ami du peuple" calling for a continuous revolution. In an article in September 1789, he said: "We should continue to pursue the enemies of society without stopping." In many articles, Marat directly or indirectly proposed that the revolution was not complete and must continue. Engels, when talking about Marat's idea of continuous revolution, said: "...only because he, like us, does not consider the revolution to be over, but wants the revolution to be declared continuous" ("Marx and the Neue Rheinische Zeitung," 1884).
    After the French Republic was declared in 1792, the Girondists, representing the big bourgeoisie, believed that the revolution was over, while the Jacobins, representing the lowest strata of the bourgeoisie, believed that the revolution should be deepened and the struggle against feudal remnants should continue. However, by 1794, the Jacobins punished striking workers and executed peasants who demanded the equal distribution of land, fully demonstrating the bourgeoisie's limitations on the revolution, which was not like the working class, which wanted to further deepen the revolution. In the successive revolutions in France, the working class fought at the forefront, but the bourgeoisie always seized the fruits of the revolution and turned around to oppress the workers. Therefore, the working class increasingly realized that the revolution was not complete and must continue. In 1840, a widespread strike movement broke out in France, with violent clashes between workers and the police, and communists engaged in open struggle for the first time. In June of that year, the electoral reformists held a banquet and did not allow communists to participate, so the latter decided to hold their own banquet. The "Communist Banquet" was held on July 1st, where workers and intellectuals spoke, emphasizing the significance of continuous revolution and calling for a continued struggle. After the meeting, a booklet, "The First Banquet of Communists," was published, announcing that the day of the banquet was the beginning of a new era in the history of the communist movement.
    In 1848, due to the February Revolution carried out by the working class, the French bourgeoisie established the Republic; the Paris proletariat continued to struggle to achieve its demands and held the June Uprising, but it was bloodily suppressed by the bourgeoisie. This made the working class more clearly aware of the necessity of continuous revolution. After Napoleon seized power and implemented terrorism, Marx and Engels pointed out that "he completed terrorism by substituting continuous war for continuous revolution" ("The Holy Family," 1845).
    From the above materials, it can be seen that Marat, at the end of the eighteenth century, was the earliest to propose the idea of continuous revolution. From then until the 1840s, for nearly half a century, the revolutionary representatives of the working class often talked about continuous revolution, and the working masses continued to carry out revolutionary struggles under the influence of this slogan. However, it was Marx and Engels who theoretically demonstrated and developed the idea of continuous revolution.

### “按需分配”和“不断革命”两语的来源

    “按需分配”和“不断革命”两语的来源
     林陵
    编者按：上月二十五日林陵同志在本版发表的“从‘按劳分配、按需分配’的正译想起的”一文里，作者曾谈到“各尽所能、按需分配”和“不断革命”两语的来源问题。最近收到一些读者来信，认为那一次所说的有不确切的地方，现在特请作者补充如下：
    “各尽所能、按需分配”这一共产主义的口号，在欧洲很早就成为相当流行的成语，马克思和恩格斯只是利用了这两句成语，并不是最初由他们“提炼为用字简洁的口号”。例如，法国空想社会主义者卡贝在1840年出版的“伊加利亚游记”中就已用“各尽所能、按需分配”这两句话。至于用类似的语句，表达了同一思想的，那就更早了。例如，意大利空想社会主义者康柏内拉早在1623年出版的“太阳城”里提出“要什么东西，都取自社会”，“每人所得的，不得超过其所需的”。法国空想社会主义者摩莱里在1753年出版的“群岛飘流记”里说：“应按人的能力，分配工作，应按人的需要，分配产品”。
    如果再追溯上去，那末在基督教圣经“新约”的“使徒行传”（作于二、三世纪）里就有类似的提法：“照各人所需用的，分给各人”。 “不断革命”的口号，也并不是最早由十九世纪布朗基的学生们提出的，这一思想在十八世纪法国大革命时期就已由革命者屡次提出了。最显著的是马拉（1743—1793），他在他所主编的“人民之友”报上写了不少号召继续不断进行革命的文章。在1789年九月的一篇文章里说：“应该毫不停止地继续追击社会的敌人”。马拉在许多文章里直接或间接地提出：革命没有完成，必须继续进行。恩格斯在谈到马拉的不断革命思想时说：“……只是由于他也像我们一样，不认为革命已经结束，而想要使革命被宣布为不断的”（“马克思与新莱茵报”，1884年）。
    1792年法兰西共和国宣布成立后，代表大资产阶级的吉伦特派认为革命已经结束，代表资产阶级最低层的雅各宾派则认为应当使革命深入下去，继续进行反对封建残余的斗争。可是到了1794年，雅各宾派既惩罚罢工的工人，又处死要求平分土地的农民，充分显示了资产阶级对革命的局限性，绝不像工人阶级那样，要使革命进一步深入。在法国历次革命中，都是工人阶级奋战在最前沿，但结果又总是资产阶级夺取了革命的果实，并且转过头来压迫工人，所以工人阶级愈益清楚地认识到，革命没有完成，必须继续进行。1840年法国展开广泛的罢工运动，工人和警察发生激烈冲突，共产主义者初次进行公开斗争。这一年的6月，选举制改革派举行宴会，不容许共产主义者参加，后者便决定自己举行宴会。7月1日举行“共产主义宴会”，会上有工人和知识分子发言，他们强调不断革命的意义，号召继续进行斗争。会后并出版小册子“共产主义者的初次宴会”，宣布举行宴会的日子是共产主义运动史新纪元的开始。
    1848年，由于工人阶级进行了2月革命，法国资产阶级建立了共和国；巴黎无产阶级为达到自己的要求，继续斗争，举行6月起义，但被资产阶级血腥镇压下去。这使工人阶级更清楚地认识到不断革命的必要。拿破仑取得政权后，实行恐怖主义，马克思和恩格斯指出，“他用不断的战争来代替不断的革命，从而完成了恐怖主义”（“神圣家族”，1845年）。
    从上述的材料来看，较早提出不断革命思想的是十八世纪末的马拉。从那时起，直到十九世纪四十年代，在差不多半个世纪的时间中，工人阶级的革命代表，时常谈到不断革命，工人群众也不断地在这个口号的影响下进行革命斗争。但是在理论上论证了和发展了不断革命这一思想的是马克思和恩格斯。
