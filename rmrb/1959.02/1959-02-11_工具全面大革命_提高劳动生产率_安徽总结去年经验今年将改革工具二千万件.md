Hefei, February 10th (Report from our newspaper) Anhui Province recently convened a provincial tool reform conference, summarizing the achievements of last year's tool reform, and fully utilizing the experience and favorable conditions of last year's mass tool reform movement. It formulated a plan for the comprehensive reform of tools throughout the province this year. This year, it is necessary to reform and newly manufacture 20 million tools and produce 30 million sets of ball bearings. It is required that labor productivity be doubled compared to last year through tool reform, to ensure the comprehensive completion of advanced indicators for industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings this year.

Last year, Anhui Province's large-scale mass tool reform movement achieved great success. The province created and improved more than 19,000 kinds of tools and promoted the use of more than 37.3 million new-style tools. The province basically achieved the advancement of water lifting tools; and 32 counties and cities achieved transportation vehicle and boat advancement; most counties and people's communes established bearing factories, farm implement factories, and repair factories, producing 12 million sets of bearings, manufacturing more than 50,000 indigenous machine tools, and installing bearings on more than 3 million tools. Last year, the efficiency of reformed tools generally increased by one to two times compared to the original, and tools installed with ball bearings generally increased by two to three times compared to the original. Some new-style tools increased efficiency by more than ten times. Due to the greatly improved labor efficiency through tool reform, the difficulty of insufficient labor during the Great Leap Forward was overcome, promoting a bumper agricultural harvest and the development of local industry.

Anhui Province's tool reform plan for this year, based on the achievements of last year's tool reform, and to ensure the comprehensive realization of the advanced indicators for a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and various construction projects this year, has a wider scope than last year, including tools for plowing, planting, hoeing, weeding, drainage, irrigation, watering, harvesting, threshing, processing, transportation, and water management; including collective living welfare tools such as cooking, energy utilization such as biogas, tools for producing ball bearings, and tools for forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. It is required to guarantee the completion of semi-mechanization, realize the improvement of major labor in production and life; realize ball bearing-ization of all rotating tools, and try to use animal power and power to replace human labor, to reduce labor intensity and ensure that workers have a certain amount of sleep and rest time. Through tool reform, average work efficiency will be doubled compared to last year. The plan proposes that we must vigorously reform tools for accumulating fertilizer, transportation, and water management, which occupy the most labor, and actively prepare for tool reform for spring plowing and spring planting.

Based on the favorable conditions such as the experience of last year's mass tool reform movement, Anhui Province has mainly adopted the following measures to ensure the realization of this year's comprehensive tool reform plan:

First, further strengthen the leadership of the tool reform movement. Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out at the provincial four-level cadre meeting on tool reform work: Party committees at all levels must treat it as the most important work and participate in research personally, so that tool reform can achieve significant results in the shortest possible time. According to this instruction, under the unified leadership of the Party committees, various localities further established and improved the leading bodies for tool reform.

Second, adhere to putting politics in command, use the abstract to drive the concrete, vigorously carry out mass movements, and adopt methods such as on-site meetings, exhibitions, appraisal and evaluation meetings, and mobile performances to overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, promote advanced technical experience, deeply mobilize the masses, and vigorously carry out tool reform.

Third, tool reform in various localities should have both a comprehensive plan and phased arrangements. According to different production seasons, determine the key points of tool reform, start early, assign tasks at each level, set deadlines, strengthen inspection, and ensure completion.

Fourth, in tool reform, resolutely implement the principle of the three-way combination of leading cadres, technicians, and worker-peasant masses, and strengthen experimental research work. Each special district and county should establish and improve agricultural tool research institutes, and people's communes should establish research groups. According to production needs, determine research tasks and continuously experiment and reform various production tools.

Fifth, each county, people's commune, and production team should adopt a method of division of labor at each level, with the county responsible for producing large-scale precision tools, the commune manufacturing general improved tools, and the production team reforming existing tools. Vigorously implement the responsibility system, strictly check the quality of manufactured tools, and do a good job in tool maintenance. Counties and communes should establish farm implement repair factories (groups), so that minor repairs of general farm tools can be done within the team, and major repairs can be done within the commune; minor repairs of agricultural machinery can be done within the commune, and major repairs can be done within the county; to achieve the requirements of good manufacturing, good maintenance, and good repair.

Sixth, carry out inspection, evaluation, and competition among special districts, counties, and communes, and determine tool reform work as the main task of this year's competition for each county and each commune. After the Spring Festival, first organize inter-county inspections on a special district basis, comprehensively appraise the tools reformed in the past, and select a complete set of new-style tools suitable for local conditions, from cultivation to harvesting, processing, and other aspects.

Seventh, do a good job in technical guidance, train technical forces, and launch a high tide of everyone learning technology. For tools with universal promotion value, short-term technical training classes and other effective methods should be adopted to break through the ideological barriers, manufacturing technology barriers, and usage technology barriers in promoting the use of new-style tools, and overcome the past tendency of some regions to have more creations and inventions but less promotion and use.

### 工具全面大革命  提高劳动生产率  安徽总结去年经验今年将改革工具二千万件

    工具全面大革命  提高劳动生产率
    安徽总结去年经验今年将改革工具二千万件
    本报合肥10日电　安徽省最近召开了全省工具改革会议，总结去年工具改革的成绩，并充分运用去年群众性工具改革的经验和有利条件，制订了今年全省全面改革工具的规划，今年需要改革和新制的工具达二千万件，生产滚珠轴承三千万套。要求通过工具改革，把劳动生产率比去年提高一倍，以保证今年工农业生产和各项建设事业先进指标全面完成。
    去年，安徽省大规模群众性的工具改革运动已经取得了巨大成绩。全省共创造和改良工具一万九千多种，推广使用新式工具三千七百余万件。全省基本上实现了提水工具先进化；并有三十二个县、市实现了运输车船化；大部分县和人民公社都办起了轴承厂、农具厂和修配厂，生产出轴承一千二百万套，制造了土机床五万多台，安装上轴承的工具达三百多万件。去年经过改革的工具，工效一般都比原来提高一倍到两倍，安上滚珠轴承的工具一般比原来提高两倍到三倍。有的新式工具，效率提高到十倍以上。由于工具改革大大地提高了劳动效率，就克服了大跃进中劳力不足的困难，促进了农业大丰收和地方工业的发展。
    安徽省今年工具改革的规划，在去年实行改革工具取得成绩的基础上，为保证今年工农业生产和各项建设更大跃进的先进指标全面实现，工具改革的范围比去年更广泛，包括耕、种、锄、耘、排、灌、浇、收获、脱粒、加工、运输、治水等工具；包括炊事等集体生活福利工具、沼气等能源利用、生产滚珠轴承的工具和林、牧、副、渔等工具。要求保证完成半机械化，在生产和生活方面主要劳动实现改良工具化；一切运转工具实现滚珠轴承化，尽量利用畜力和动力来代替人力劳动，以减轻劳动强度，保证劳动者有一定的睡眠和休息时间。通过工具改革，平均工效比去年提高一倍。规划提出当前必须大力改革占用劳动力最多的积肥、运输、治水等工具，积极为春耕春种做好工具改革准备。
    安徽省各地在有了去年群众性工具改革运动的经验等有利条件的基础上，对于如何保证今年全面工具改革规划的实现，主要采取了以下一些措施：
    第一，进一步加强工具改革运动的领导。中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣同志在省委四级干部会议上对工具改革工作曾指出：各级党委要当成最重要的工作来进行，并要亲自参加研究，使工具改革能够在最短的时间内做出显著的成绩。根据这一指示，各地在党委统一领导下，进一步建立和健全工具改革的领导机构。
    第二，坚持政治挂帅，以虚带实，大搞群众运动，采取现场会、展览会、评比鉴定会、巡回表演等方法克服右倾保守思想，推广先进技术经验，深入发动群众，大搞工具改革。
    第三，各地工具改革既要有全面规划，又要有分段安排，根据不同的生产季节，确定改革工具的重点，及早动手，逐级定任务，限日期，加强检查，保证完成。
    第四，在工具改革中要坚决贯彻领导干部、技术人员和工农群众三结合的方针，加强试验研究工作。各专区、县建立和健全农具研究所，人民公社成立研究组，根据生产需要，确定研究任务，不断试验和改革各种生产工具。
    第五，各县、人民公社、生产队采取逐级分工的办法，县负责生产大型精密的工具，公社制造一般性的改良工具，生产队改制现有的工具。大力贯彻责任制，严格检查制造工具的质量，做好工具的保养工作，县、社都应建立农具修配厂（组），作到一般农具小修不出队，大修不出社；农业机械小修不出社，大修不出县；达到制造好、保养好、修理好的要求。
    第六，开展专区、县、社之间检查评比竞赛，确定工具改革工作为今年每县、每社竞赛的主要任务。春节后，先以专区为单位，组织县际检查，对过去改革的工具全面鉴定，评选出适合地区情况的从耕作到收获、加工及其他各方面一整套的新式工具。
    第七，作好技术指导工作，培训技术力量，掀起人人学技术的高潮。对于具有普遍推广价值的工具，应采取举办短期技术训练班，以及其他各种有效办法，突破推广使用新式工具中的思想关、制造技术关和使用技术关，克服过去有些地区存在的创造发明多，推广使用少的偏向。
