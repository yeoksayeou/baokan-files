The exploration work in Gansu Province in 1958 achieved a great harvest. This place, surrounded by the Qilian and Longshan Mountains, is full of treasures.

Last year, nearly four thousand large and small mineral deposits were found throughout the province, more than four and a half times the total number of mineral deposits found during the entire First Five-Year Plan period. Proven reserves include thirty-nine kinds of minerals such as iron, manganese, copper, aluminum, zinc, gold, tungsten, and molybdenum. The proven coal reserves in the past year were five times the proven reserves during the First Five-Year Plan period, and the proven iron reserves were 1.2 times more than the total proven reserves during the First Five-Year Plan period.

The perpetually snow-capped Qilian Mountains, after a year of exploration, have revealed far more mineral deposits than previously estimated, including ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, non-metals, and rare metal ores. New place names such as "Sulfur Mountain," "Specular Iron Mountain," and "Petroleum Gully," named after mineral deposits, have appeared on and around the mountains. Because of the abundance of minerals, geological personnel affectionately call the Qilian Mountains "China's Urals," and local villagers call it "Treasure Mountain." In people's minds, the Qilian Mountains have become synonymous with "treasure."

In some places where rivers originate from the Qilian Mountains and at the foot of the mountains, minerals eroded from the mountains by rainwater have accumulated into ore deposits. When people scoop up a handful of alluvial sand from the bends of the Dang River and Hei River and observe it carefully, they can find small, glittering particles carried down from the mountains. This is gold ore, and the gold-bearing area of the Dang River alone is dozens of kilometers long. According to geological personnel, the gold content in each cubic meter of sand here is about five grams. On the foothills of the Qilian Mountains to the west of Anxi County, a natural sulfur belt several kilometers long was recently discovered. Accumulated sulfur is piled up on the ground, emitting a strong odor. As long as the mixed mud and sand are removed, it is high-quality sulfur, so people call this area "Sulfur Mountain."

Last year, geological personnel also cooperated with mountaineers to climb the high peaks of the Qilian Mountains above the snow line to explore for treasures. They climbed peaks with an elevation of six thousand meters and finally found several valuable mineral deposits under the snow and ice.

A year ago, a saying circulated in Gansu that there were no mineral deposits in Longnan. Now it has been proven that the Longnan area is rich in mineral deposits such as copper, aluminum, and zinc, making it another treasure house of the motherland. The area of the West Qinling Mountains in Longnan is covered with lush grass and herds of cattle and sheep. In the past, people thought that this was only a good pasture and would not have mineral resources. Therefore, this area was called "Dacaotan" (Great Grass Beach), and for several years no geological personnel had searched for minerals here. Last year, a mass mineral exploration campaign was launched here, with participants including geological personnel, county party secretaries, elementary school students, and, more importantly, tens of thousands of farmers. People picked up hammers, carried bamboo baskets for mineral samples, and searched for minerals all over the mountains. The found ores were subjected to rapid chemical analysis on the spot. Within an area of more than one thousand square kilometers, hundreds of mineral deposits were found in just a few dozen days. The discovery of mineral deposits in the West Qinling Mountains greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses in Longnan for mineral exploration. Many mineral deposits such as aluminum, zinc, copper, iron, and tungsten have been discovered in various parts of Longnan, and some of these non-ferrous metal deposits have been determined to be very large in scale.

### 祁连山、陇山地区遍地是宝  去年找到矿点四千处

    祁连山、陇山地区遍地是宝
    去年找到矿点四千处
    本报讯　甘肃省1958年的勘探工作获得大丰收。这个为祁连山、陇山所环抱的地方，遍地有宝。
    去年，全省找到了近四千处大小矿点，这些矿点的数量比第一个五年计划期间找到的全部矿点还多四倍半。已经探明储量的有铁、锰、铜、铝、锌、金、钨、钼等三十九种，去年一年探明煤的储量等于第一个五年计划期间探明储量的五倍，探明铁的储量比第一个五年计划期间探明储量总和还多一点二倍。
    终年积雪的祁连山，经过去年一年的勘探，发现了比过去估计多得多的矿藏，黑色金属、有色金属、非金属、稀有金属矿。山上山下，出现了“硫黄山”、“镜铁山”、“石油沟”等以矿藏命名的新地名。因为矿产丰富，地质人员亲切地称祁连山为“中国的乌拉尔”，当地老乡叫它为“宝山”，祁连山在人们心目中已成为“宝藏”的代名词。
    发源于祁连山的河流和山麓的一些地方，因为雨水冲刷，山上零碎冲积下来的矿物竟堆积成矿。当人们从党河、黑河的拐弯处，捞起一把冲积的河沙，仔细观察，可以找到从山上带下的光泽灿烂的小颗粒。这就是金矿，光党河的产金地带就有几十公里长。经过地质人员研究，这里每方沙子含金量在五克左右。在安西县西面的祁连山麓，最近发现一条几里长的自然硫带，冲积下来的硫黄堆积在地面，散发着浓郁的气味，只要把夹杂的泥沙除掉，就是质量很好的硫黄，因此人们就把这一带叫做“硫黄山”。
    去年，地质人员还和爬山运动员协作，攀登上雪线以上的祁连山高处探宝。攀上了拔海六千公尺的高峰，终于在冰雪的复盖下，找到了好几处宝贵的矿藏。
    一年以前，甘肃流传一种论调——陇南没有矿藏。现在证明陇南地区，盛产铜、铝、锌等矿藏，是祖国的又一座宝库。陇南西秦岭一带，绿草如茵，牛羊成群，过去人们认为这里只是一处好牧场，不会有矿产，因此，这一带叫做“大草滩”，好几年来一直没有地质人员去找矿。去年这里开展了群众性的找矿活动，参加的人有地质人员，有县委书记，有小学生，更多的是数以万计的农民。人们拿起锤子，背着盛矿样的竹筐，满山遍野找矿。找到的矿石，就地进行快速化学分析。在一千多平方公里的面积内，只经过数十天时间，就找到了上百个矿点。在西秦岭地区找到矿藏后，大大鼓舞了整个陇南的群众找矿热情，在陇南各地又发现了铝、锌、铜、铁、钨等许多矿藏，其中有些有色金属矿已确定规模很大。
