Tirana, February 16th (By our Correspondent) – February 15th marks the tenth anniversary of the convening of the First National Congress of Agricultural Cooperatives in Albania. Over the past ten years, Albania's agricultural collectivization movement has achieved unprecedented development and has demonstrated the superiority of collective production.

Ten years ago, in 1949, when the First National Congress of Agricultural Cooperatives was convened, there were only fifty-six agricultural cooperatives in Albania, with a total cultivated area of only 10,870 hectares, accounting for only 3.4% of the country's cultivated land. But today, ten years later, by the end of 1958, there were 1,935 agricultural cooperatives in the entire republic, an increase of nearly thirty-five times. They collectively owned more than 284,200 hectares of land, accounting for 76.2% of the country's cultivated land. In areas such as Vlora, Lushnjë, and Sarandë, cooperatives have been established in every village. In the fastest-developing Gjirokastër region, the cultivated land of all cooperatives accounts for 98.6% of the region's cultivated land. Albania's collectivization was established under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, starting from demonstration to consolidation and rapid development. Especially after the Third National Congress of Agricultural Cooperatives was convened in September 1956 and the cooperative charter was revised, Albania's collectivization entered a stage of great development. For example, in the first seven years of this stage, the number of cooperatives only increased from fifty-six to three hundred and eighteen, but in the short three years since then, the number has increased from three hundred and eighteen to one thousand nine hundred and thirty-five. The cultivated area has surged from 14% of the country's cultivated land to 76.2%. This year, the Albanian Labor Party has also determined to overfulfill the task of fully collectivizing the plains areas.

The superiority of cooperation has brought great encouragement and improved material life to the broad masses of farmers. According to statistics from the Albanian Ministry of Agriculture, in 1949, one work-day was only equivalent to ten leks and just over three kilograms of grain. But today, in cooperatives in many areas such as Korçë and Fier, the income from a work-day is five or six times higher than in the past. Each year, the yield per unit area of cooperatives has greatly exceeded that of individual farmers. For example, wheat averages 20%-40% higher, while corn, sugar beets, and cotton are sometimes more than 50%, and sometimes almost 70%-80% higher. This has become the most convincing force in attracting new members.

Cooperative members, in response to the Party's call, have more comprehensively developed agriculture and animal husbandry. For example, in the past ten years, the number of dairy cows in cooperatives across the republic has increased from seventy-eight to sixteen thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine, an increase of two hundred and seventeen times. Sheep have increased from three thousand four hundred and fifty-six to more than two hundred and ninety thousand, and pigs have increased from sixty to more than nineteen thousand. When farmers are enjoying such a happy life, they cannot help but thank the Albanian Labor Party and the people's government for their leadership and maternal care. In the last three years alone, the government has provided agricultural loans to cooperatives amounting to two billion leks. The area irrigated by government-built water conservancy projects has expanded one and a half times compared to pre-war levels. Today, tractors, seeders, and harvesters are running in the fields of Albania. The country's twenty-one tractor stations have prepared more than 2,800 tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower) and thousands of other agricultural machines for farmers. Under the Party's cultivation, four thousand cooperative cadres have entered schools for advanced studies. Among them, there are eight hundred and eighty-nine chairpersons of agricultural cooperatives. The Party has also established five hundred and forty cultural centers in the vast rural areas. Culture has opened its doors to the people. Last year alone, four hundred and eleven drama groups and nine hundred and forty-eight dance and choir teams were established in rural areas.

    阿尔巴尼亚合作化运动大发展
    合作社全面发展农牧业　社员生活水平日益提高
    本报地拉那16日电　2月15日是阿尔巴尼亚召开全国第一届农业合作社代表大会十周年纪念日。这十年来，阿尔巴尼亚的农业合作化运动获得了空前的发展，并已显示出了集体生产的优越性。
    十年前，即1949年，召开第一届农业合作社代表大会时，全阿尔巴尼亚仅有五十六个农业合作社，全部的耕地面积仅一万零八百七十公顷，即占全国耕地面积3.4％。但十年后的今天，到1958年底，全共和国已有一千九百三十五个农业合作社，这就增加了近三十五倍。它们共拥有土地达二十八万四千二百多公顷，已占全国耕地面积76.2％。在发罗那、卢希尼、萨兰达等区，都已村村建社。在发展最迅速的纪诺卡斯特区，全部合作社的耕地并已占全区耕地面积的98.6％。阿尔巴尼亚合作化是在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下，从示范到巩固和迅速发展下建立起来的。特别是在1956年9月召开了全国第三次农业合作社代表大会，修订了合作社章程以后，阿尔巴尼亚合作化更进入大发展的阶段。如在这一阶段的前七年中，合作社仅从五十六个发展到了三百一十八个，但最近短短的三年来，就从三百一十八个增加到了一千九百三十五个。耕地面积从占全国耕地面积14％激增到了76.2％。今年，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党又确定了要超额完成平原地区全部合作化的任务。
    合作的优越性给广大农民带来了巨大的鼓舞和物质生活的提高。据阿尔巴尼亚农业部的统计，在1949年，一个劳动日仅折合十个里克和三公斤多粮食，但今天，在科尔察、费里等不少地区的合作社的劳动日所得已五、六倍于过去。每一年，合作社的单位面积产量都大大超过了个体农民。如小麦平均超过20％—40％。而玉米、甜菜和棉花有的超过50％，有的几乎超过70％—80％。这就成为了吸引新社员的最有说服力的力量。
    合作社社员响应党的号召，更全面地发展了农业和畜牧业。例如十年来全共和国合作社的乳牛就从七十八头发展到了一万六千九百二十九头，增加了二百一十七倍。羊从三千四百五十六头增加到了二十九万多头，猪从六十头增加到了一万九千多头。农民们在获得这样幸福生活的时候，不能不感谢阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民政权的领导和慈母般的关怀。仅仅最近三年来，政府贷给合作社的农业贷款就达二十亿里克。政府兴修水利因而受到灌溉的面积比战前扩大了一倍半。今天，在阿尔巴尼亚的田野上，已行驶着拖拉机、播种机、收割机，全国二十一个拖拉机站，为农民准备了二千八百多台拖拉机（以十五马力计）和数千台其他各种农业机器。在党的培养下，四千个合作社干部进入了学校深造。其中农业合作社主席就有八百八十九人。党并在广大农村建立了五百四十个文化中心。文化已为人民敞开了大门，仅去年一年，在农村建立的戏剧小组就有四百一十一个，舞蹈合唱队共达九百四十八个。（附图片）
