    Asian-African Youth Unite and Struggle for Peace, Independence, and Freedom
    The Asian-African Youth Conference, which lasted a week, successfully concluded in Cairo on February 8th. During these days, over four hundred youth representatives from more than fifty Asian and African countries gathered to discuss a series of major issues of common concern under the general theme of "The Role of Youth in Strengthening Asian-African Solidarity," and adopted six resolutions on political, youth affairs, cultural, artistic, sports, and social affairs issues. This is a major event in the lives of Asian-African youth and also a major event in the lives of Asian-African people.
    The Asian-African Youth Conference was held under the spirit and guidance of the Bandung Conference and the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. The declaration issued by the conference stated: "We unanimously agree and unreservedly support the principles of the Bandung and Cairo Conferences and are determined to fight for the realization of these principles." It is because of this that the conference was successful. Although these youth representatives come from countries with different social systems, have different political views and ideologies, and different religious beliefs, they undoubtedly have many common demands. The common desire for peace, independence, and freedom unites them, making them an important political force in the Asian-African national liberation struggle and the peace movement.
    The Asian-African Youth Conference reflects the urgent desire and indestructible will of millions of Asian-African youth to strive for and safeguard national independence and oppose imperialism. Both in the speeches of the representatives and in the resolution on political issues adopted by the conference, imperialism and colonialism were strongly condemned. This is a completely logical result. The fate of youth has always been integrated with the fate of all the people. Without the freedom and liberation of the entire nation, the beautiful aspirations and ideals of young people cannot be realized. The aggression and oppression of imperialism and colonialism were, and still are, the root cause of backwardness and poverty in many Asian-African countries. Asian-African youth, deeply affected by the scourge of imperialism and colonialism, have a glorious revolutionary tradition and have participated in the cause of national liberation one after another. Revolutionary youths in many Asian-African countries have written countless magnificent poems for the independence and freedom of their motherland.
    Now, the world situation has undergone fundamental changes. In the past decade or so, many Asian and African countries, encompassing 1.4 billion people, have been liberated from colonial rule. Imperialist countries have few remaining colonies in Asia, and looking at the African continent, more than one-third of the land area and nearly half, that is, about 100 million people, have been liberated from the shackles of colonialism. The doomsday of the imperialist colonial system is not far away. The younger generation of Asia and Africa has the full potential to bury colonialism with their own hands and usher in a new world of peace and happiness. What an exciting prospect!
    In this new situation, the sacred task of the Asian-African people and the Asian-African youth is to, together with the people of the world, mobilize a broader force, strengthen unity, and persist in the struggle to accelerate the process of the demise of imperialism and the total collapse of the colonial system. Imperialism will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history. On the contrary, as it approaches its demise, it will make even more frantic death throes. Currently, there are still 160 million people living under colonial rule, and Western colonialists are carrying out bloody suppression of this part of the people. The most ferocious enemy of the Asian-African people, American imperialism, is trying to replace old-brand colonial countries such as Britain and France and impose new colonial shackles on the Asian-African people. The military aggression blocs such as the "Baghdad Pact" and the "Southeast Asia Treaty" it planned and the military bases established in the Asian-African region seriously threaten the independence and security of Asian-African countries. It uses methods such as so-called "military aid," "economic aid," and "private investment" to interfere in the internal affairs of Asian-African countries, undermine the independence of Asian-African countries, plunder the natural resources of Asian-African countries, and obstruct the development of the national economy of Asian-African countries. The imperialist camp headed by the United States is unwilling to let the Asian-African people move towards independence and new life. They are also stepping up their planning of military offensives, political subversion, and various conspiracies to stifle the independence and freedom that the people of many Asian-African countries have already gained. The Asian-African people and Asian-African youth fully understand that imperialism and colonialism will always be irreconcilable deadly enemies of the Asian-African people. The Asian-African Youth Conference correctly believes that the people's struggle against imperialism is the same struggle. The conference called on Asian-African youth to use various means of peaceful struggle and armed struggle in each country according to their own special conditions. This is a great call to struggle issued by the Asian-African Youth Conference to the youth of Asian-African countries.
    In order to weaken the strength of the national liberation movement, imperialism is using despicable means to divide and undermine the unity between Asian-African countries and the unity within the national united fronts of these countries, and has recently made special attempts to undermine the unity between Arab countries. The Asian-African Youth Conference solemnly condemned the imperialists' conspiracies against independent Arab countries, especially against Iraq and the United Arab Republic, pointing out that the purpose of imperialism is to split the Arab countries and obstruct their struggle, and condemned the imperialist practice of using Asian-Africans to oppose Asian-Africans. The Asian-African Youth Conference resolutely supported the anti-colonial struggles of the people of Algeria, Palestine, Cameroon, Kenya, Uganda, Madagascar, Zanzibar, Cyprus, Somaliland, Equatorial Africa, Congo, Maghreb, Rhodesia, and other countries in its resolutions; supported the Cambodian people's adherence to a policy of active neutrality despite the pressure exerted by American imperialism; and supported the Indian people's demand for the recovery of Goa, the Indonesian people's demand for the recovery of West Irian, and the Bahraini people's struggle for independence. The conference designated February 20 as "Cameroon Day," July 15 as "Support Equatorial Africa Day," and July 18 as "Support Oman Day." The conference also adopted a resolution on opposing racial discrimination. All these resolutions fully embody the solidarity and unity of the Asian-African people and Asian-African youth in the common struggle against imperialism. This great unity of the people of Asian-African countries is an important guarantee for the victorious struggle against imperialism and colonialism.
    The Asian-African Youth Conference has also made a significant contribution to the cause of maintaining world and Asian-African peace. In its resolution on consolidating world peace, the conference called for the immediate, unconditional, and permanent cessation of nuclear weapons tests, a ban on the use and storage of nuclear weapons, and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes; it called for disarmament and the use of military budget savings to improve people's living standards. The Asian-African Youth Conference strongly condemned American imperialism's aggression in the Taiwan region of our country, and pointed out that this aggression threatened the people of the world. The conference called for the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, affirmed the legitimate rights of the Mongolian People's Republic in the United Nations, and supported the peaceful reunification of Korea and Vietnam. The conference designated March 31 as "Day Against Testing and Use of Nuclear Weapons," and April 24 as the day for achieving the goals stipulated in the United Nations Charter and strengthening national movements and promoting the principles of peaceful coexistence. These calls, reflecting the common aspirations of Asian-African youth and Asian-African people, will undoubtedly further mobilize public opinion and youth masses in Asian-African countries to participate in the struggle to defend peace. The national liberation movement itself is an important part of the movement to defend world peace. As long as the Asian-African people and the people of the world take on the responsibility of maintaining peace, the imperialist war plots can be shattered and war can be avoided, and lasting peace for mankind can be achieved in today's situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind. Other resolutions passed by the Asian-African Youth Conference are of positive significance for promoting cultural exchanges between Asian-African youth and enhancing their unity.
    There is no doubt that the resolutions of the Asian-African Youth Conference will have great significance for the struggle of Asian-African youth and Asian-African people for peace, independence, and freedom. We Chinese youth and the 650 million Chinese people fully support the resolutions of the Asian-African Youth Conference and will continue to contribute all our strength to the cause of opposing imperialism, opposing colonialism, and defending world peace. We firmly believe that the great struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and colonialism will surely achieve final victory.

    亚非青年团结起来，为和平、独立、自由而斗争
    2月8日，历时一星期的亚非青年会议已经在开罗圆满闭幕了。在这些日子里，来自亚非五十多个国家的四百多名青年代表聚集一堂，以“青年在加强亚非团结方面的作用”为总议题，讨论了一系列共同关心的重大问题，并且通过了关于政治、青年事务、文化、艺术、体育和社会事务问题的六项决议。这是亚非青年生活中的一件大事，也是亚非人民生活中的一件大事。
    亚非青年会议是在万隆会议和亚非人民团结大会的精神鼓舞和指导下举行的。会议发表的宣言指出：“我们一致同意和毫无保留地支持万隆和开罗会议的原则，并且决心为实现这些原则而斗争。”正是因为这样，所以会议获得了成功。尽管这些青年代表们来自不同社会制度的国家，具有不同的政治观点和意识形态、不同的宗教信仰，但是他们无疑地有着许多共同的要求，和平、独立与自由的共同愿望使他们团结起来，成为亚非民族解放斗争与和平运动中的一支重要的政治力量。
    亚非青年会议反映了千百万亚非各国青年争取和维护民族独立、反对帝国主义的迫切愿望和不可摧毁的意志。无论在代表们的发言中和在会议通过的关于政治问题的决议中，都强烈地谴责了帝国主义和殖民主义，这是完全合乎逻辑的结果。青年的命运从来都是和全体人民的命运融合在一起的，没有整个民族的自由和解放，青年人对于生活的美好憧憬和理想就不可能得到实现。帝国主义和殖民主义的侵略和压迫曾经是而且现在仍然是亚非许多国家落后和贫困的根源。深受帝国主义和殖民主义祸害的亚非青年富有光荣的革命传统，曾经前仆后继地参加了民族解放的事业。亚非许多国家的革命青年，为了祖国的独立和自由写下了无数可歌可泣的壮丽的诗篇。
    现在，世界形势已经发生了根本的变化。近十余年间，亚非包括十四亿人口的许多国家从殖民统治下解放了出来。帝国主义国家在亚洲的殖民地已所剩无几了，而放眼非洲大陆，也有三分之一以上的土地面积和将近一半，即一亿左右的人口从殖民主义的枷锁下解放了出来。帝国主义殖民制度的末日，已经为期不远了。亚非的年青的一代，完全有可能亲手埋葬掉殖民主义，迎接一个和平幸福的新世界的来临。这是多么激动人心的前景啊！
    在这个新的形势下，亚非人民和亚非青年的神圣任务就是，和全世界人民一道，动员更广泛的力量，加强团结，坚持斗争，以加速帝国主义灭亡和殖民体系总崩溃的过程。帝国主义是不会自动地退出历史舞台的，相反，在它临近灭亡的时候，还要作更加疯狂的垂死挣扎。目前还有一亿六千万人民仍然生活在殖民统治之下，西方殖民主义者正在对这一部分人民进行着血腥的镇压。亚非人民最凶恶的敌人，美国帝国主义正在力图替代英法等老牌殖民国家，把新的殖民主义枷锁强加在亚非人民头上。它策划的“巴格达条约”和“东南亚条约”等军事侵略集团和在亚非地区建立的军事基地，严重地威胁着亚非各国的独立和安全。它用所谓“军事援助”、“经济援助”、“私人投资”等手段，干涉亚非国家的内政，损害亚非国家的独立和掠夺亚非国家的自然资源，阻挠亚非国家民族经济的发展。以美国为首的帝国主义阵营是不甘心于让亚非人民走向独立和新生的，它们还正在加紧策划军事进攻、政治颠复和各种各样的阴谋，来扼杀亚非许多国家的人民所已经获得的独立和自由。亚非人民和亚非青年完全懂得，帝国主义和殖民主义，永远是亚非人民不可调和的死敌。亚非青年会议正确地认为，人民反对帝国主义的斗争是同一的斗争。会议呼吁亚非青年根据各自的特殊条件在每个国家使用和平斗争和武装斗争的各种手段。这是亚非青年会议向亚非各国青年发出的一个伟大的斗争号召。
    帝国主义为了削弱民族解放运动的力量，正在采用卑劣的手段分化和破坏亚非国家之间的团结和这些国家民族统一阵线内部的团结，最近特别企图破坏阿拉伯国家之间的团结。亚非青年会议严正地谴责了帝国主义者针对独立的阿拉伯国家，特别是针对伊拉克和阿拉伯联合共和国的阴谋诡计，指出帝国主义的目的在于分裂阿拉伯国家和阻挠它们的斗争，并且谴责了帝国主义利用亚非人来反对亚非人的作法。亚非青年会议在决议中有力地支持了阿尔及利亚、巴勒斯坦、喀麦隆、怯尼亚、乌干达、马达加斯加、桑给巴尔、塞浦路斯、索马里兰、赤道非洲、刚果、马格里布、罗得西亚等国人民的反殖民主义的斗争；支持了柬埔寨人民不顾美帝国主义施加的压力，坚持积极中立政策；支持了印度人民要求收回果阿、印度尼西亚人民要求收回西伊里安和巴林人民争取独立的斗争。会议规定了2月20日作为“喀麦隆日”、7月15日作为“支持赤道非洲日”和7月18日作为“支持阿曼日”。会议还作出了关于反对种族歧视的决议。所有这些决议，充分地体现了亚非人民和亚非青年在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中的团结一致。亚非各国人民的这种伟大的团结，是胜利进行反对帝国主义、殖民主义的斗争的重要保证。
    亚非青年会议对于维护世界和亚非地区的和平事业也作出了重大的贡献。会议在关于巩固世界和平的决议中，要求立刻无条件地永久停止核武器试验，禁止使用和储藏核武器，并且使原子能为和平服务；要求裁减军备，并且把军费预算用来提高人民的生活水平。亚非青年会议严厉地谴责了美国帝国主义在我国台湾地区所从事的侵略，并指出这种侵略威胁着世界人民。会议要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位，确认蒙古人民共和国在联合国的合法权利，支持朝鲜和越南的和平统一。会议规定了3月31日作为“反对试验和使用核武器日”、4月24日作为实现联合国宪章所规定的目标以及加强民族运动和促进和平共处原则的日子。这些反映了亚非青年和亚非人民的共同心愿的号召，无疑将进一步动员亚非各国的公众舆论和青年群众参加保卫和平的斗争。而民族解放运动本身也就是保卫世界和平运动的一个重要部分。只要亚非人民和全世界人民把维护和平的责任担当起来，在今天东风压倒西风的形势下，帝国主义的战争阴谋是能够被粉碎的，战争是可以避免的，人类的持久和平是能够争取得到的。亚非青年会议所通过的其它决议对于促进亚非各国青年之间的文化交往，增强他们之间的团结，都有积极的意义。
    毫无疑问，亚非青年会议的决议将对亚非青年和亚非人民为和平、独立和自由的斗争有着重大的意义。我们中国青年和六亿五千万中国人民完全支持亚非青年会议的决议，并将继续为反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义和保卫世界和平的事业贡献出自己的全部力量。我们坚决地相信，全世界人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的伟大斗争一定取得最后的胜利。
