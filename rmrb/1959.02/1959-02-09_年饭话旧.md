Reminiscing Over New Year's Eve Dinner
By our reporter Sun Yuchang

In the Red Flag People's Commune's Home of Respect for the Elderly in Yingcheng County, Hubei Province, the twenty-three elderly people being supported were even happier than usual on February 4th – the 27th day of the twelfth lunar month – because the commune prepared the New Year's Eve dinner for these elderly people in advance. The New Year's Eve dinner was very rich, not only with fish and meat, but also with wine prepared for everyone.

Eating New Year's Eve dinner is an old habit of the Chinese people. In previous years, every time the Spring Festival came, the agricultural cooperatives always invited these lonely elderly people to eat a New Year's Eve dinner at each house. This year is very different. As soon as the people's commune was established, it set up a home for these elderly people – the Home of Respect for the Elderly. This year they ate their first New Year's Eve dinner in their new home.

Before the meal was brought, the elderly people were very excited, discussing who to invite to eat the New Year's Eve dinner with them, and also wanting to take this opportunity to talk about their innermost thoughts. Old man Tu Changqing was quick-witted and suggested inviting Yang Zuqun, the Party General Branch Secretary of the Qixing Management Area, to accompany them. When Secretary Yang received this invitation, he was in a meeting and couldn't go; moreover, he was afraid that going there would make these elderly people sentimental and talk about the hardships of the old society. In that case, the happy New Year's Eve dinner would not be enjoyable. Secretary Yang politely declined the invitation; but promised to pay an early New Year visit to the elderly after the meeting. The elderly people happily ate the New Year's Eve dinner. As it was getting dark, Secretary Yang indeed came to the Home of Respect for the Elderly. The elderly people, like a group of young people, expressed their gratitude to Secretary Yang for the commune's meticulous care for them with overflowing emotion. Old farmhand Li Baotian told Secretary Yang that since liberation, the lives of him and his wife have been on a straight upward path, especially after entering the commune's Home of Respect for the Elderly, where the commune takes care of their food and clothing. They can play if they want to, sleep if they want to, and chat with a few people if they want to talk, or twist grass ropes if they can't stay idle. All these blessings are due to the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

Secretary Yang thought that these elderly people had worked hard for decades in the old society and had not had a single good day. Now that the commune has been established and production has improved, they should enjoy some happiness; but he did not want them to feel sorry, so he interjected, "Yes, the younger generation should let the older generation enjoy happiness. Our production level is not high enough now, and there must be areas where we are not taking good enough care. Please give us some advice!"

"In the old society, when we could still work, the landlords endlessly exploited us, but when we reached our age, the landlords treated us worse than their own dogs. The commune has lifted us to the sky and taken such good care of us, what advice can we give!" said old man Tian Songshan, who was blind. These words aroused Li Baotian's bitter tears. Immediately, this old man recalled decades of past events: In the old society, he had not an inch of land nor a single room, worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord for nineteen years, and worked as a miner for twenty years. He did the work of two people, but still could not fill the stomachs of his family. Later, when he got old, society abandoned him. No one hired him, and no one supported him. Helpless, he had to take his family to beg for food, running around all day, begging from door to door, and spending the night in desolate mountain temples. The adults were so hungry that they were dizzy, and sometimes they didn't even have the strength to speak, but they still had to force themselves to beg. Seven or eight children were tortured to death by hunger and disease when they were very young. Only the old couple were left at the time of liberation. Speaking of this, Li Baotian pointed to his wife, Li Cuixiang, beside him and said: One year, she went to beg for food on the eve of the Spring Festival, and the landlord's vicious dog bit her chest, causing blood to flow. She was so angry that she wanted to die, crying and saying that it would be better to hang herself than to starve to death, freeze to death, and suffer piecemeal crimes. I persuaded her a lot before she didn't do it.

As he spoke, the old man sighed deeply, tears welling up in his old eyes, full of emotion.

Li Cuixiang saw clearly and was afraid that Li Baotian would be too sad, so she advised them not to mention the past. The old people and Yang Zurong present, however, disagreed with her. They said in various ways, let him count them, and it will be more enjoyable to pour them out. Remembering the crimes of the old society will make you feel the happiness of today more deeply.

"The crimes of the old society cannot be poured out in a moment," Li Baotian concluded his words.

    年饭话旧
    本报记者　孙玉昌
    湖北应城县红旗人民公社敬老院里，被赡养的二十三位老人在2月4日——旧历腊月27日这一天，比平日更加愉快，因为公社提前给这些老人作了年饭。这顿年饭很丰盛，不仅有鱼有肉，而且还为大家准备了酒。
    吃年饭是中国人的老习惯，往年每逢过春节，农业社也总是挨门挨户地请这些孤独的老人去吃一顿年饭。今年则大不同，人民公社一成立就给这些老人立了一个家——敬老院，今年在新家里吃了首次年饭。
    饭还没拿来，老人们心情很激动，商量着请什么人来陪吃年饭，也想趁这个机会说说自己的心里话。涂长青老人心眼灵，建议请七星管理区党总支书记杨祖群作陪。杨书记得到这邀请时，正在开会，顾不上去；另外，又怕去了使这些老人触景生情，谈起旧社会的辛酸事。这样，快乐的年饭就会吃不成。杨书记婉言谢绝了这个邀请；但答应开过会后，一定给老人去辞个早年。老人们欢欢乐乐地吃了一顿年饭。天快黑的时候，杨书记果然来到了敬老院，老人们像一群年青人一样，感情洋溢地向杨书记表示感激公社对他们的无微不至的照顾。老雇农李保田告诉杨书记，解放以来，他和老伴的生活是在直线上升，特别是进了公社的敬老院，吃穿都由公社给操办，爱玩就玩，爱睡就睡，爱谈就凑几个人在一起聊聊天，闲不住就搓搓草绳子。这些幸福，都是靠共产党、毛主席的好领导得来的。
    杨书记心想这些老人在旧社会劳碌了几十年，没有一天好日子过，现在成立了公社，搞好了生产，他们应当享点福了；但他又不愿使他们感到过意不去，便插话说：“是的，后人应当让老一辈享福，现在咱们的生产水平还不高，照顾不到的地方一定还有，就请大家提点意见吧！”
      “在旧社会里，我们还能干活时，地主就无限地剥削我们，可是一当到了像我们这大年岁时，地主对待我们还不及他家的狗。公社把我们抬到天上，照顾我们这样好，还提得出什么意见！”双目失明的田松山老人这样说。这话倒引起了李保田的辛酸泪，顿时，这老人回忆起几十年的往事：在旧社会的几十年里，他地无一亩房无一间，给地主当了十九年的长工，干了二十年的矿工，一个人干着两个人的活，仍然不能填饱一家老小的肚子。后来老了，社会把他抛弃了，没有人雇用他，更没有人养他，无奈只有拉家带口去讨饭，白天四处流奔，挨门求告，夜宿荒山野庙，饿得大人昏昏沉沉，有时连说话的劲也没有，还得强打精神去讨要，七、八个小孩都是很小的时候被饿和病折磨死了，解放时只剩下老两口。说到这里，李保田指了指在身旁的老伴李翠香说：有一年她在春节前夕去讨饭，被地主家的恶狗把她的胸部咬得鲜血直流，气得她想讨死，哭闹着说饿死冻死遭零碎罪，还不如吊死来得痛快。我好劝赖劝她才没这样作。
    说着说着，老人唉的长叹一声，老眼眶里噙泪欲下，感慨万分。
    李翠香看得清楚，怕李保田过分伤心，就劝他们过去的事莫提了。在座的老人和杨祖荣却与她不同，七言八语地说，让他数落吧，倒完了就会更痛快。记住旧社会的罪恶，对今天的幸福会体会得更深刻。
      “旧社会的罪恶不是一时能倒完的。”李保田结束了他的话。
