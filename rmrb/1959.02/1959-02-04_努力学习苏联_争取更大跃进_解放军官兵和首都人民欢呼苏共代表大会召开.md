    Strive to Learn from the Soviet Union, Strive for Greater Leap Forward
    PLA Officers and Soldiers and People of the Capital Cheer the Convening of the Soviet Communist Party Congress
    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces are heartily celebrating the convening of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with joy and excitement. In recent days, from the front lines to the rear, from coastal defense to the border, millions of officers and soldiers have been focusing on Moscow and praising Comrade Khrushchev's report on the control figures for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union from 1959 to 1965, a grand program for advancing towards communism.
    In the past few days, troops stationed throughout the country have been vying to read Comrade Khrushchev's report. Officers and soldiers stationed on the borders, islands, and patrol ships, unable to see newspapers immediately, have been gathering around radios every day to listen to news about the 21st Congress. Many officers, pilots, gunners, and sailors have also excitedly held spontaneous gatherings next to airplanes, gun positions, and decks to hold discussions. The vast number of officers and soldiers of various organs of the troops in the Beijing area unanimously agreed in the discussions that the 21st Congress is a conference of special significance in the contemporary era. Khrushchev's report is a milestone in the Soviet Union's construction of communism. Everyone expressed that in future work, they will take the Soviet elder brother as an example and strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.
    In a unit of the Jinan area troops, twenty-eight veteran soldiers who are about to retire and participate in construction in the frontier, after studying the documents of the congress, unanimously felt that it was a great encouragement to them and were determined to take the Soviet people as an example, go all out, and build the frontier of the motherland.
  The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Wuhan area troops believe that Comrade Khrushchev's report is a combat program for realizing the great ideal of communism. The Soviet Union's magnificent seven-year construction plan fully illustrates that communism is no longer a distant ideal.
    Sailors guarding ships and islands organize to listen to news of the congress every day. Zhu Dafa, the chief petty officer of a ship's engine room and a representative to the National Congress of Young Activists, said: The faster the Soviet Union leaps forward, the faster imperialism will die. At a time when imperialism is setting in the west, we must be especially vigilant against the enemy's conspiracies, strengthen combat training, and resolutely smash all the conspiracies of imperialism.
    In the Air Force, aviators held many forums. Fang Shouzhong, the head of a flying regiment, said that the year 1959 has just begun, and many major events have occurred in the world. On January 2, the Soviet Union successfully launched a cosmic rocket; the anti-colonial movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing, and the recent 21st Congress of the CPSU marks the beginning of a new historical period for the great Soviet people. All this proves Chairman Mao's brilliant assertion that "the enemy is rotting away day by day, and we are getting better day by day."
    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The people of the capital continue to hold various activities to congratulate the opening of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
    Some workers and technicians from the Beijing Electron Tube Factory who had interned in the Soviet Union held a forum this afternoon to talk about Comrade Khrushchev's grand program for building communism. Zhou Tianguang, deputy director of the Second Workshop, and young worker Zhang Xiren said: We must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet elder brother even better to accelerate our country's socialist construction. Encouraged by the 21st Congress of the CPSU, all employees of the factory have exerted greater enthusiasm and launched a high-yield week.
    Many members of the People's Commune also said that they would further study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, go all out, and achieve a greater leap forward. Wang Zhanlin, a member of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Society of the Shijingshan People's Commune, said that the more he read Comrade Khrushchev's report, the happier he became. He expressed that he must put in even greater effort and make a great effort in the current vigorous fertilizer accumulation movement to ensure a greater leap forward in agricultural production this year. A few days ago, all the members of this society also sent a letter to the Soviet people, warmly congratulating the Soviet people on setting a brilliant example for all mankind in the construction of communism.
    Teachers and students of higher education institutions in the capital have also held discussions in recent days. Students in the Department of Political Education at Beijing Normal University wrote lyrics to praise the Soviet Seven-Year Plan—a magnificent plan for communist construction. Zhao Jing, associate professor of the Department of Economics at Peking University, said that from the control figures report of the Seven-Year Plan proposed by Comrade Khrushchev, we saw the Soviet people taking magnificent strides towards a comprehensive advance towards communism. The realization of the Seven-Year Plan will greatly strengthen the power of the socialist camp and cause capitalism to suffer a thorough defeat. (Attached picture)
