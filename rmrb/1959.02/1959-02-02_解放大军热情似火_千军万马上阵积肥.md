Xinhua News Agency, February 1st – The Chinese People's Liberation Army's many units are widely launching a mass manure collection campaign. Under the slogan of "Fight the first battle well this year to support agricultural production and ensure a bumper harvest," the vast number of officers and soldiers are using various methods such as digging, sweeping, smoking, picking, and composting, taking time out to fight for manure collection.

The Beijing area military leadership issued a notice to its subordinate units on January 29 regarding active participation in the mass concentrated manure collection campaign, requiring all units to immediately contact local party and government departments and make achievements under the unified leadership of the local Party committee. Many units have set targets and launched a "10,000 Jin of Manure per Person" campaign. A certain unit currently holding an expanded Party committee meeting, in addition to making specific plans for manure collection at the meeting, all representatives and office cadres spent three days collecting more than one million Jin of fertilizer. In the high tide of mass manure collection, officers and soldiers were burning with enthusiasm, and many soldiers braved the severe cold of minus sixteen degrees Celsius and gale-force winds of level five or six to compost fertilizer and pick up manure in the fields. Yang Hongchu, political instructor of a certain tank company, led the entire company in a four-day battle, collecting more than four thousand Jin of manure. Military officers participating in the rectification of communes in various places, in addition to joining the commune members in the manure collection upsurge, also purchased their own manure-picking tools, ensuring that their hands were always on the manure basket when they went out.

In Guangdong, from the mountainous areas of northern Guangdong to Hainan Island, wherever there are troops, there are large numbers of soldiers helping the people's communes collect manure. According to incomplete statistics, the troops in various parts of Guangdong have helped the communes collect more than 445,000 dan of manure and transport more than 100,000 dan in the past month. The troops stationed in Shantou, while allocating manpower to help the people's communes collect manure, also sent technical personnel to assist local people's communes in vigorously developing indigenous bacterial fertilizers. Eighteen military officers who went to Lechang County to help rectify the commune, together with the commune members, studied and improved the tools for collecting and transporting manure, and the reform of a single manure transportation tool alone increased labor efficiency tenfold.

In the three northeastern provinces, the mass manure collection campaign began in October of last year after the vigorous deep plowing of land, during which they collected as much as 800 million Jin of fertilizer. Thirty military officers from a certain unit stationed in Shenyang have been braving the cold wind every day since the beginning of winter, going to the streets to sweep up horse manure and sludge, and dredging sediments from the sewers, collecting more than 30,000 Jin of manure in two months. The troops in the Shenyang area also established fifty-eight chemical fertilizer plants, using local materials to vigorously mine peat and produce more than 2,680 tons of Azotobacter, phosphate bacteria, and potassium-magnesium fertilizer, which not only met the needs of the troops' cultivated land, but also strongly supported the people's communes. On the 29th, the leadership of the troops in this area issued another notice on concentrated manure collection, and a new manure collection upsurge is taking shape.

The manure collection campaign in the Jinan area has developed quite extensively and deeply, and many companies have launched manure collection competitions between platoons and squads. Some units have manure pits in each squad, using dirty water, furnace ash, mud, weeds, etc. to compost fertilizer, and every morning, noon, and evening, the soldiers carry manure baskets to pick up manure. The Second Company of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit collected more than 11,000 Jin of manure in two days. The army troops stationed in Qingdao used various methods of manure collection, and the fertilizer sent to the people's communes in January alone amounted to more than 58,000 Jin.

The first round of manure collection by the Fujian front-line troops has been victorious, with eleven units collecting a total of more than 150 million Jin of fertilizer. The second round starts on the 31st, and all available manpower, vehicles, and horses are heading to the manure collection sites and fields. Their goal is: 20,000 Jin of fertilizer per person. Troops in the Nanjing, Kunming, Lanzhou and other regions have also successively joined the upsurge of mass manure collection and made achievements.

Now, the troops where the manure collection campaign has been launched with great fanfare are advancing victoriously; the troops that are launching the manure collection campaign are also catching up. The officers and soldiers are determined to make new contributions to this year's agricultural bumper harvest in the days when the earth returns to spring. (Photo attached)

    解放大军热情似火  千军万马上阵积肥
    新华社1日讯　中国人民解放军许多部队广泛展开群众性的积肥运动。广大官兵在“打好今年支援农业生产第一仗，确保农业大丰收”的口号下，利用挖、扫、熏、拣、沤等各种办法，抽出时间为积肥而战。
    北京地区部队领导机关1月29日向所属部队发出了关于积极参加全民突击积肥运动的通知，要求各部队立即与地方党政部门联系，在地方党委统一领导下作出成绩。许多部队订出指标，发起了“每人积肥万斤”的运动。正在举行党委扩大会的某部，会上除了作出积肥的具体计划以外，全体代表和机关干部用三天时间就积了一百多万斤肥料。在全民积肥高潮中，官兵们热情似火，许多战士冒着零下十六度严寒和五六级大风，在野外沤肥拾粪。某坦克连政治指导员杨洪初率领全连奋战四天，拾粪四千多斤。到各地人民公社参加整社的军官，除了和社员一起投入积肥热潮以外，还自购拾粪工具，作到外出时手不离粪筐。
    在广东，从粤北山区到海南岛，哪里有部队，哪里就有大批战士帮助人民公社积肥。据不完全统计，广东各地部队一个月来已帮助公社积肥四十四万五千多担，运肥十多万担。驻汕头的部队，在抽出人力帮助人民公社积肥的同时，还派出技术人员协助当地人民公社大搞土制细菌肥料。到乐昌县帮助整社的十八名军官，同社员一起研究改进积肥和运肥的工具，仅其中改革的一项运肥工具就提高了劳动效率十倍。
    东北三省的部队，从去年10月大搞深翻土地以来，群众性的积肥运动就开始了，这期间他们积肥达到了八亿斤之多。驻沈阳某部有三十名军官，入冬以来每天天刚亮就冒着寒风上街打扫马粪、污土，打捞下水道的沉淀物，两个月内积粪三万多斤。沈阳地区部队还兴办了五十八座化学肥料厂，就地取材，大挖草炭，制出两千六百八十多吨固氮菌、磷微菌和钾镁肥，不仅满足了部队耕地的需要，还大力支援了人民公社。29日，这个地区部队领导机关又发出突击积肥的通知，一个新的积肥高潮正在形成。
    济南地区部队的积肥运动发展得相当广泛、深入，许多连队在班、排之间展开了积肥竞赛。有些部队每个班都有积肥坑，利用脏水、炉灰、烂泥、杂草等沤肥，每天早晨、中午、傍晚，战士们背着粪筐外出拾粪。高射炮兵某部二连两天时间积肥一万一千多斤。驻青岛的陆军部队利用各种积肥方法，1月份光送给人民公社的肥料就有五万八千多斤。
    福建前线部队积肥的第一个回合已经取得胜利，十一个单位共积肥一亿五千多斤。第二个回合从31日开始，所有能抽出来的人力、车辆、马匹全部奔赴积肥场和田间。他们的目标是：每人积肥两万斤。南京、昆明、兰州等地区部队也先后投入了全民积肥的热潮，作出了成绩。
    现在，积肥运动已经轰轰烈烈展开的部队，正在乘胜前进；正在开展积肥运动的部队，也在迎头追赶。官兵们决心在大地回春的日子里，为今年农业大丰产作出新的贡献。（附图片）
