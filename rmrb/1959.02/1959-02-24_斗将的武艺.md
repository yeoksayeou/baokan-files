    The martial arts play a decisive role in face-to-face combat between generals.
    Novels and operas record many stories of "returning the spear," "snatching the spear," and "flying ropes."
    During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, the famous general Geshu Han was skilled at using the "returning spear." He had a servant named Zuo Che, who was fifteen or sixteen years old and very strong. Whenever Geshu Han chased an enemy and got close, he would use his spear to tap the enemy's back, shout loudly, and the enemy, startled, would turn around. Geshu Han would take the opportunity to stab the enemy in the throat, lift him up three to five feet, and throw him down, without fail. At this point, Zuo Che would dismount and cut off the enemy's head, doing this every time.
    The Tang Dynasty's Great General Yuchi Jingde was skilled at dodging spears. In every battle, he would charge into the enemy ranks alone on horseback, and although the enemy's spears would stab at him from all sides, they could never harm him. He was also skilled at snatching the enemy's spears and using them to stab the enemy in return, moving in and out of heavy encirclements without hindrance.
    Emperor Taizong's brother, Qi Wang Yuanji, also knew how to use a spear and looked down on Jingde, wanting to compete with him. Taizong told them to remove the blades from their spears and only use the shafts to stab each other. Jingde said, "Even with the blade, you cannot hurt me, so there is no need to remove it. But mine can be removed." As a result of the competition, Yuanji could not hit him.
    Taizong asked him, "Which is more difficult, snatching a spear or dodging a spear?" Jingde said, "Snatching a spear is more difficult." Taizong then told him to snatch Yuanji's spear. Yuanji held his spear, mounted his horse, and intended to stab Jingde, but before long, his spear had been snatched by Jingde three times. Yuanji was famous for his bravery, and although he praised Jingde highly in words, he was very annoyed in his heart, feeling humiliated.
    Wang Shichong led tens of thousands of infantry and cavalry to battle. The brave general Shan Xiongxin led the cavalry to chase Taizong directly. Jingde jumped on his horse, shouted loudly, and stabbed Xiongxin, causing him to fall from his horse. The enemy army retreated slightly, and Jingde protected Taizong and broke through the enemy encirclement. (Zeng Gongliang's "Wujing Zongyao Houji" 9)
    Long weapons could only be used in close-range, face-to-face combat; they were useless at a distance. At this point, bows and arrows came into play. In addition, there was a throwing weapon called the "flying rope." During the reign of Empress Wu Zetian, the Khitan general Li Kaigu was skilled at using the "flying rope," horsemanship, archery, and spear dancing. Every time he charged, he was like a falcon diving into a flock of birds, unstoppable. In the Battle of Huangzhang (a place name), the Tang generals Zhang Xuan and Ma Renjie were both roped. ("Zizhi Tongjian" Volume 206)
    Long weapons also emphasized weight. The "New Tang History" Volume 193, "Biography of Zhang Xing," states: "He was a deputy commander of Raoyang. When An Lushan rebelled and attacked Raoyang, Xing put on armor and held a modao, weighing fifteen pounds. When the enemy climbed the city wall, Xing would kill several people with one swing of his knife, and the enemy was very afraid." The "Song History, Military Records" 11 records that in 1000 AD, Jiao Wo, the deputy commander of the Shenqi cavalry, presented a flat iron spear, weighing fifteen pounds, which he could wield like the wind on horseback. There was also a monk from Xiangguo Temple named Fashan, who returned to secular life and joined the army. He used an iron wheel, weighing thirty-three pounds, with blades on both ends, which was a weapon for close combat on horseback.
    In the mid-Tang Dynasty, the modao was popular for combat. The most famous modao general was Li Suye, who always broke through enemy lines when he was a team leader. In 748 AD, Gao Xianzhi attacked Bolu (a country name, located in the Soviet territory outside Xinjiang today. Originally inhabited by the Eastern and Western Burut people. Burut is Bolu). Suye and the lieutenant general Tian Zhen were the left and right modao generals. The Tubo army of 100,000 held the city of Suole, relying on the mountains and water. Suye led the infantry with long knives up the mountain and defeated the enemy army greatly. In the Battle of Xiangjisi against An Lushan in 756, Suye stripped off his clothes, fought bare-handed, held a long knife, stood in front of the formation, and shouted loudly. The men and horses who faced Suye's knife were all crushed (Old Tang History, Volume 109). Kan Leng was skilled at using a two-edged knife, one zhang long, called a "pai dao." With one swing, he could kill several people, and no one could stand against him (New Tang History, Volume 92, Biography of Kan Leng). The biographies of Pei Xingjian and Cui Guangyuan also record stories of using modao in battle. The annotation in Tongjian Volume 202 states that the modao is a large knife, and one swing of the knife can kill several people. The Tang Liudian states that the modao is a long knife, used by infantry, and is the ancient beheading horse sword.

    斗将的武艺
    刘勉之
    战将和战将面对面的搏斗中，武艺起决定作用。
    小说戏文里记着许多回马枪、夺槊、?索的故事。
    唐玄宗时名将哥舒翰善用回马枪。他有家奴名左车，十五、六岁，很有力气。哥舒翰每追敌人靠近了，用枪搭敌人的背，大喝一声，敌人失惊回头，趁势刺中喉头，挑起三五尺掼下，没有不死的。这时左车便下马割取首级，每次如此。
    唐太宗的大将尉迟敬德善于避矟，每战，单骑冲入敌阵，敌人的矟四面攅刺，终不能伤。又会夺敌矟，反刺敌人，出入重围，往还无碍。
    太宗的兄弟齐王元吉也会使矟，看不起敬德，要和他比赛。太宗叫两人把矟的刃去掉了，光用矟竿相刺。敬德说：“带刃也不能伤我，不必去。但我的可以去掉。”比的结果，元吉竟不能中。
    太宗问他：“夺矟避矟，那个难些？”敬德说：“夺矟难。”太宗就叫夺元吉的矟。元吉执矟跃马，一心打算刺杀敬德，不料一会儿功夫，他的矟三次被敬德所夺。元吉以骁勇著名，虽然口头上十分称赞，心里却非常恼恨，以为丢人。
    王世充领步骑数万来战，骁将单雄信领骑直追太宗，敬德跃马大呼，横刺雄信坠马，敌军稍退，敬德护卫着太宗突出敌围。（曾公亮武经总要后集九）
    长武器毕竟只能近距离面对面厮杀，远一些就不济事了。这时，弓箭就起了作用。另外，有一种抛掷式的武器叫?索。武则天时契丹将李楷固善使?索和骑射、舞槊，每次冲锋，都如鹘入鸟群，所向披靡。黄麞（地名）之战，唐将张玄遇、麻仁节皆为所?（资治通鉴卷二○六）。
  长武器也讲究重量，新唐书卷一九三张兴传：“为饶阳裨将，安禄山反，攻饶阳，兴擐甲持陌刀，重十五斤，敌人登城，兴一举刀就杀几个人，敌人很害怕。”宋史兵志十一记公元一○○○年时神骑副兵马使焦偓献盘铁槊，重十五斤，在马上挥舞如飞。还有相国寺和尚法山，还俗参军，用铁轮拨，浑重三十三斤，头尾有刃，是马上格战的武器。
    唐代中期流行用陌刀作战，最著名的陌刀将是李嗣业，每为队头，所向必陷。公元七四八年高仙芝攻勃律（国名，在今新疆边外苏联境内。本为东西布鲁特人所居。布鲁特即勃律。），嗣业和郎将田珍为左右陌刀将，吐蕃十万众据守娑勒城，据山因水，嗣业领步军持长刀上山头，大破敌军。七五六年和安禄山香积寺之战，嗣业脱衣徒搏，执长刀立于阵前大呼，当嗣业刀的人马都碎（旧唐书卷一○九）。阚棱善用两刃刀，长一丈，名曰拍刀，一挥杀数人，前无坚对（新唐书卷九十二阚棱传）。裴行俭传和崔光远传也都记有用陌刀作战的故事。通鉴卷二○二注，陌刀，是大刀，一举刀可杀数人。唐六典说，陌刀是长刀，步兵所用，就是古代的斩马剑。
