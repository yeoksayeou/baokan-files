    Beijing No. 1 Middle School, in implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor, focuses on learning while incorporating productive labor as a course in the curriculum. Labor projects are arranged according to students' different ages, grades, physical strength, and the courses they are studying. High school students, in conjunction with their physics and chemistry classes, participate in more complex labor in the platinum, bearing, and hydrochloric acid workshops of the Beijing Automobile Accessories Factory, which are located in the school. Junior high school students, in conjunction with their zoology and botany classes, cultivate vegetable gardens, raise rabbits, and keep bees. In this way, students apply the knowledge they have learned to practice, which deepens their interest in learning and improves the quality of education. Last semester, 92% of the students in six classes of the third year of high school achieved excellent or good grades in physics, and 85.3% achieved excellent or good grades in algebra.

    北京市第一中学在贯彻执行教育与生产劳动相结合的方针中，以学习为主，把生产劳动作为一门功课列入课程表。根据学生不同年龄、年级、体力与所学的课程安排劳动项目。高中学生结合物理、化学课参加北京汽车附件厂设在学校里的白金、轴承、盐酸等车间，进行比较复杂的劳动。初中学生结合动物、植物课，种植菜园、养兔、养蜂。这样，学生把学得的知识运用到实际中去，对学习的兴趣更浓厚了，教育质量也提高了。上学期，高中三年级六个班的学生物理获得优良的占92％，代数获得优良的占85.3％。
