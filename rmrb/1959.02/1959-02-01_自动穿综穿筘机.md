Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, January 31st: A domestically produced automatic warp tying and reeding machine was recently created in the Qingdao Joint State-Private Cotton Weaving Factory No. 2. From now on, the last manual operation in China's textile industry will come to an end.

Currently, in China's modern textile industry, warping, dressing, weft winding, sizing, and weaving have all been mechanized. Only the work of drawing in warp threads through heddles, reeds, and drop wires is done manually. For many years, those involved in the textile industry have explored the path of using machinery for this process, but without success.

Encouraged by the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, Ren Huating, an old warping worker who only attended school for three years, demonstrated the communist spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. He decided to start creating a warp tying and reeding machine. With the assistance of the factory's Party committee and workers, Ren Huating successfully created the automatic warp tying and reeding machine after more than three months of research. After testing, the machine proved to have excellent performance. Three shifts (22.5 hours) can produce 45 warps, increasing efficiency by 1.6 to 2.2 times compared to general manual production.

    自动穿综穿筘机
    新华社青岛31日电  国产自动穿综穿筘机最近在青岛公私合营棉织二厂诞生。从此，我国纺织工业中最后一道手工操作工作，将告结束。
    目前，我国现代化纺织工业中的络经、整经、络纬、浆纱及织布等工作，都已经实行了机械生产，只是穿综穿筘穿仃经片用手工操作。多少年来，纺织界的有关人员曾摸索用机械进行穿综穿筘穿仃经片的道路，但是一直没有成功。
    在党的建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，只读了三年书的整经老工人任华亭，发挥了敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，决定动手创造穿综穿筘机器。在工厂党委和工人的协助下，任华亭经过三个多月的研究，终于把自动穿综穿筘机创造成功。经过试验，证明机器的性能很好，三个班（二十二个半小时）能做织轴四十五个，比一般人工生产提高效率一点六到二点二倍。
