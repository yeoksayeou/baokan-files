1958 Winter Wheat High-Yield Experience
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute

In 1958, China's winter wheat achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with approximately 760,000 mu yielding over 1,000 jin per mu, and over 300 mu yielding over 3,000 jin per mu. Based on on-site investigations at key locations and data from nearly 100 high-yield fields across the country with yields exceeding 1,000 jin per mu, a preliminary summary is presented below, covering five aspects: soil, density, fertilizer, water, and seed.

Soil

In the past, based on observations under conditions of low fertilizer application and shallow plowing, it was believed that wheat roots were mainly distributed in the topsoil layer within 20 centimeters, and that wheat was a shallow-rooted crop that did not require deep plowing. However, the high-yield experience of 1958 shattered this outdated concept. According to data from high-yield experimental fields across various regions, the average plowing depth was about one chi (foot). This is approximately twice as deep as ordinary fields in the past. Furthermore, under the combined influence of comprehensive cultivation conditions, yield tended to increase with deeper plowing.

The yield-increasing effect of deep plowing depends on the soil fertility and fertilization. Better soil fertility or more fertilizer application leads to a greater yield-increasing effect. Therefore, deep plowing must be combined with increased fertilizer application. Deep plowing greatly enhances soil aeration, permeability, and water retention, which is conducive to the activity of aerobic microorganisms, releasing some mineral nutrients that were previously unavailable for plant absorption and utilization. Deep plowing breaks up the hard plow pan beneath the topsoil layer, creating ample space for wheat root growth and expanding the root absorption area. As a result, the development of wheat roots in the lower soil layers is significantly strengthened. According to a survey by the Central China Agricultural Science Research Institute in Gucheng, Hubei, wheat roots in high-yield experimental fields had well-developed fibrous roots in the 20 to 50 centimeter deep soil layer, and fine root clusters could still be seen at a depth of 180 centimeters. Such a strong root system greatly improves wheat's drought and wind resistance, providing a favorable foundation for preventing lodging.

Deep plowing is generally carried out in layers. The shallow layer of ripened soil is both plowed and turned, while the deep layer of raw soil is only plowed but not turned, unless there are special circumstances regarding the layered distribution of soil texture that necessitate mixing and blending. Deep plowing must be combined with layered fertilization, applying different types and quantities of fertilizers according to different soil layers. Generally, less fertilizer is applied in the lower layer, and more fertilizer is applied in the upper and middle layers. Coarse fertilizers are mixed and applied in each layer, while fine fertilizers are mostly applied in the upper and middle layers. Each layer must be thoroughly mixed to integrate soil, fertilizer, and water. This can accelerate the ripening process of raw soil, modify soil structure, and thereby improve fertilizer utilization.

Based on the experience of 1958 and current production conditions, a suitable deep plowing standard for large-area high-yield fields in 1959 is around one chi.

Density

In 1958, many high-yield experimental fields with yields exceeding 3,000 jin per mu had more than one million ears per mu. Under such high density, the ears were still large, with many grains and heavy grains, and lodging did not occur. This shattered the biased conclusion that dense planting would lead to "small ears with few grains and weak stalks prone to lodging," and the "limit" that "wheat will lodge if it exceeds 500,000 ears per mu."

Dense planting further clarified that increasing the seeding rate and relying on the main ears and some tillers before winter is the basic way to increase the number of ears, enlarge the ears, and ensure increased production. In 1958, the seeding rate in many high-yield experimental fields was about twice as high as in ordinary fields. Under the comprehensive influence of other cultivation conditions, yield was directly proportional to the seeding rate. For example, wheat fields with yields exceeding 1,000 jin per mu had an average seeding rate of 19.5 jin, while those exceeding 2,000 jin had 23 jin, and those exceeding 3,000 jin had 27.9 jin.

Increasing the seeding rate must be done with uniform sowing and proper ventilation and light transmission. Narrow-row drilling and widening the sowing width are generally used. Based on data from 37 high-yield experimental fields with narrow-row drilling, the higher the yield, the smaller the required row spacing. This is consistent with the results of recent comparative experiments in various regions. Widening the sowing width is also a major method of dense planting. Generally, the sowing width is equal to or slightly wider than the row spacing, about 4-6 cun (inches). In 1958, the widest sowing width in high-yield fields was 1.2 chi (3 cun row spacing).

In 1959, the seeding rate for large-area high-yield fields in the northern winter wheat region should be 30-40 jin per mu, and in the southern rice-wheat double-cropping region, it should be 20-35 jin per mu. In the Central Plains and northern winter wheat regions where drill sowing is customary, the drill spacing can be reduced to 3-5 cun. Where conditions permit, 7.5-15 cm row drillers should be used as much as possible. In the southern winter wheat region, narrow-row drilling can also be adopted for early-season fields.

Fertilizer

In the past, under conditions of shallow plowing and sparse planting, cultivating wheat led to the phenomenon of "excessive vegetative growth and delayed maturity, causing lodging," so people dared not apply more fertilizer. It was generally believed that China's soil was not deficient in phosphorus and potassium, and that applying phosphorus and potassium fertilizers was ineffective. The ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers was about 1:0.5:0.5. In 1958, the masses adopted fertilizer application rates that were more than ten times or even dozens of times higher than in the past in small-area high-yield experimental fields. According to data from 76 high-yield experimental fields with relatively detailed records of fertilizer application, yield increased accordingly with the increase in fertilizer application. The comprehensive ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer application was about 1:1:2. The proportion of phosphorus and potassium was greatly increased. From the amount of fertilizer applied per mu to produce 100 jin of wheat, approximately 5 jin of nitrogen, 5 jin of phosphorus, and 10 jin of potassium are required. If converted based on nitrogen content, about 2,500 jin of medium-quality coarse fertilizer is required.

In terms of fertilization techniques, it is necessary to achieve a rational combination of the three elements of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, with organic fertilizer as the main component and chemical fertilizer as a supplement. Base fertilizer should be the main component, and various fertilizers should be applied in stages according to the needs of the seedling, plant, ear, and grain during different growth periods. Applying sufficient base fertilizer is an important factor in ensuring high yield and preventing lodging. According to statistics from nearly 100 high-yield experimental fields, base fertilizer accounts for 46% of the total fertilizer application, pre-winter topdressing accounts for 34%, and post-winter topdressing accounts for 20%. In many high-yield fields, the amount of base fertilizer accounts for more than 50%. Deep plowing provides conditions for increasing fertilizer application, mainly using layered fertilization and uniform mixing to create a deep and fertile soil layer.

Topdressing should focus on winter fertilizer and spring fertilizer, supplemented by late-stage topdressing. Generally, high-yield experimental fields take applying sufficient base fertilizer, increasing seed fertilizer, and strengthening pre-winter fertilization management to ensure the robust growth of the above-ground parts and roots of wheat plants before winter as a key measure to obtain many ears, large ears, many grains, and full grains in the coming year.

During the pre-winter greening, jointing, and booting stages, combine irrigation with phased topdressing of fast-acting nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers, focusing on applying them in two or three applications in the early stage. If too much nitrogen is applied in the later stage, it is easy to cause lodging, which should be avoided. In 1958, many high-yield experimental fields applied wood ash in the spring to prevent lodging, but most of them applied it too late, which should be improved. As for applying phosphorus fertilizer in early spring, it has not received due attention and needs to be promoted.

Water

According to the mass high-yield experience and experimental data from the northern and Central Plains winter wheat regions, it is generally appropriate to irrigate before sowing, before freezing, during greening, during jointing, during the period from heading to flowering, and during grain filling. The specific implementation depends on the wheat seedlings, soil moisture, and weather conditions. Experienced farmers attach great importance to irrigating the soil thoroughly before sowing, as this is the foundation for full and strong seedlings. After deep plowing, the soil layer is relatively loose, so it is necessary to irrigate the soil thoroughly once to ensure that the soil settles, so as to prevent the soil layer from subsiding and breaking the wheat roots in the future, and also to facilitate future irrigation management. Early spring irrigation is key. Appropriate irrigation during this period can increase the number of ears per unit area, the length of the ears, the number of grains, and reduce the number of sterile ears, which has a great effect on increasing yield. However, this is the period when wheat plants are rapidly rising and jointing, and if the timing and amount of irrigation are not properly controlled under the condition of a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer application, it is easy to cause excessive vegetative growth and lodging. In response to these situations, in order to control the growth and development of wheat, some areas have proposed the slogan "First water early, second water late," that is, appropriately advance the greening irrigation and delay the jointing irrigation, so that the wheat seedlings grow more firmly during the jointing period, which is reasonable. However, if the jointing irrigation is too late, it will also increase ineffective tillering, so it is necessary to adjust the water use according to the growth of the wheat plants, so that it can both avoid lodging and achieve high yield. If there is insufficient water during the grain-filling and ripening period, it will cause different degrees of shriveled grains and reduce yield. Farmers generally attach great importance to irrigating this time. If there is no rain for a long time after irrigation or there is a dry and hot wind (the Central Plains winter wheat region often suffers from dry wind in late May), it is still effective to irrigate again during the grain-filling period or to fill in the gaps for full grains. The farming proverb says: "Wheat grows a line, and hits half more," and irrigating at this time can achieve the effect of "wheat growing a line." For example, in 1958, the Xin Xin Commune in Yanshi, Henan, increased irrigation to fill the gaps eight or nine days before maturity, and the thousand-grain weight was 1.8 grams heavier than that of those who did not irrigate.

Seed

The varieties used in the high-yield fields in 1958 were all old varieties. Although improved seeds accounted for the majority, there were also some local varieties. This fully proves that as long as advanced high-yield cultivation techniques are applied, the productivity of any existing variety has the potential to increase several times, breaking the previous error of underestimating the productivity and adaptability of varieties, believing that existing improved varieties only have a productivity of 600-700 jin per mu, while farm varieties will lodge if they are less than 500 jin.

The varieties selected in the high-yield experimental fields in 1958 were mostly high-yielding varieties with strong stalks, lodging resistance, and strong stress resistance. Looking at the varieties used in 36 wheat fields with yields exceeding 3,000 jin per mu, "Bi Ma No. 1" and "Nanda 2419" each accounted for 13 fields. In addition, "Zhongnong 28" and "Huixian Red" were also used. The plants of the latter two varieties are not tall and have strong stalks, which is very beneficial for preventing lodging. "Pingyuan 50" has large ears and many grains. "Nanda 2419" has large ears and large grains. These varieties have moderate tillering ability and good stalks. Through reasonable dense planting, it is relatively easy to control the number of effective tillers, which is a favorable factor under high-yield conditions. According to the performance of some biological characteristics of the varieties in the high-yield experimental fields, short stalks, strong stalks, fertilizer resistance, disease resistance, large ears, long ears, many flowers, and large grains are the main goals of future breeding of high-yielding varieties.

The high-yield practice of winter wheat in 1958 has initially formed a set of comprehensive high-yield cultivation techniques centered on "dense planting as the center, deep plowing as the foundation, fertilizer and water as the prerequisite, proper variety matching, close management, and elimination of diseases and insects to fully ensure high yield," but it still needs to be continuously enriched and improved in the future.

    1958年冬小麦丰产经验
    中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所
    1958年我国冬小麦获得空前大丰收，亩产一千斤以上的约七十六万亩，三千斤以上的约三百余亩。现根据基点的实地调查和全国各地近百个亩产千斤以上的高产田的资料，从土、密、肥、水、种等五方面初步总结如下：
    土
    以往在少肥和浅耕的基础上观察到小麦根系主要分布在二十厘米以内的表土层，认为小麦是浅耕作物，可以不深耕。但是，1958年的丰产经验打破了这一陈腐观念。根据各地高产试验田的资料，平均深耕约一尺。这比以往一般大田加深一倍左右，并且在综合栽培条件的共同影响下，随着耕层的加深，产量还有递增的趋势。
    深耕的增产效果依地力基础和施肥情况而定，地力基础好或施肥多，增产效果就大。因此深耕深翻必须与增施肥料相结合。深耕后土壤的通气性、透水性和保水力均大为增强，有利于好气性微生物的活动，解放了原来不能为植物吸收利用的部分矿物质养分。深耕破坏了表土层下坚硬的犁底层，为小麦根部生长创造了宽裕的空间，扩大了根系的吸收面。因此，土壤中，下层的小麦根系发育显著加强。根据华中农业科学研究所在湖北谷城的调查，高产试验田的小麦根系，在二十到五十厘米深土层中须根相当发达，一直到一百八十厘米处仍可看到微细的根群。这样强大的根系，大大提高了小麦抗旱抗风性能，给防止倒伏提供了有利的基础。
    深耕一般是分层进行。浅层的熟土又犁又翻，深层的生土只犁不翻，除土壤质地的层次分布有特殊情况必须掺混调和外，不要把底下的生土翻上来。深耕必须结合分层施肥，根据不同土壤层次，施用不同种类和数量的肥料。一般是下层施肥较少，上中层施肥较多；粗肥混合施在各层，细肥多施在上中层，每层均须做到充分混合，使土、肥、水融为一体。这样可以加速生土熟化过程，改造土壤结构，从而提高肥料的利用率。
    根据1958年的经验和当前的生产条件，1959年大面积丰产田的深耕标准，以一尺上下为宜。
    密
    1958年许多亩产三千斤以上的高产试验田，每亩都有一百万穗以上。在这样高的密植情况下，依然穗大、粒多、粒重，并没有发生倒伏，打破了已往认为密植会使“穗小粒少，秆软易倒”的片面结论和“小麦每亩超过五十万穗就要倒伏”的“极限”。
    密植并进一步明确了增加播种量，依靠主穗和部分年前分蘖，是增加穗数，加大穗子，保证增产的基本途径。1958年许多高产试验田的播种量比一般大田增多一倍左右。在其他栽培条件的综合影响下，产量与播种量为正比例，如亩产一千斤以上的麦田，平均播种量为十九点五斤，二千斤以上的二十三斤，三千斤以上的为二十七点九斤。
    增加播种量必须匀播，并适当保持通风透光。一般采用窄行条播和加宽播幅。根据三十七块窄行条播的高产试验田的资料看来，产量愈高，要求行距愈小。这与近年来各地试验对比的结果是一致的。加宽播幅也是密植的主要方式。一般播幅与幅距相等或稍宽，约为4—6寸。1958年高产田中播幅最宽的是一点二尺（3寸幅距）。
    1959年北方冬麦区大面积丰产田每亩播种量三十到四十斤，南方稻麦两熟区每亩播种量二十到三十五斤。中原及北方冬麦区原有耧播习惯，可把耧距缩改到三到五寸。有条件的尽可能采用七点五到十五厘米条播机。南方冬麦区的早茬田也可以改用窄行条播。
    肥
    以往在浅耕、稀植的条件下栽培小麦，得出“肥多会徒长贪青，引起倒伏”的现象，不敢多施肥料。一般认为我国土壤不缺磷、钾，施用磷、钾肥无效。氮、磷、钾肥的配合比例约为1∶0.5∶0.5。1958年群众的小面积高产试验田上采用了超过过去十几倍乃至数十倍的施肥量。根据较详细记载施肥情况的七十六块高产试验田的资料推算，随着施肥量的增加，产量也相应提高。综合氮、磷、钾的施肥比例约为1∶1∶2。其中磷、钾比重大为提高。从每亩生产一百斤小麦所施的肥料数量看来，约需氮五斤，磷五斤，钾十斤。如依含氮量折算，约需质量中等的粗肥二千五百斤。
    在施肥技术上必须做到氮、磷、钾三要素的合理配合，以有机肥料为主，化肥为辅。以基肥为主，再根据苗、株、穗、粒不同生育时期的需要，分期追施各种肥料。施足底肥是保证丰产、防止倒伏的重要环节。据近百个高产试验田的材料统计，底肥占总施肥量的46％，冬前追肥占34％，冬后追肥占20％。其中不少高产田的底肥量占50％以上。深耕深翻为增施肥料准备了条件，主要采用分层施肥，均匀混合，以创造深厚的肥沃土层。
    追肥要以冬肥、春肥为主，后期追肥为辅。一般高产试验田把施足底肥、增施种肥和加强冬前施肥管理以保证麦株地上部和根系在冬前健壮生长，作为来年获得穗多、穗大、粒多、粒饱的一个关键性措施。
    冬前返青、拔节以迄打苞期结合灌水分期追施速效性氮、磷、钾肥，着重在前期分二、三次施用。如后期追氮过多容易引起倒伏，宜加避免。1958年不少高产试验田为了防止倒伏在春季追施草木灰，但多数施得较晚，应予改进。至于早春追施磷肥，则尚未引起应有的重视，有待提倡。
    水
    根据北方和中原冬麦区的群众丰产经验和试验资料，一般在播前、冻前、返青、拔节、孕穗至抽穗、灌浆等期浇水为适宜。具体施行要看麦苗、墒情和天气情况而定。有经验的农民十分重视浇足底墒水再行播种，因为这是全苗壮苗的基础。深耕深翻后土层比较疏松，必须浇一次底墒水使土壤落实，以免日后土层下陷，折断麦根，也便利以后的灌溉管理。早春浇水是关键，这一时期适当浇水可以增加单位面积穗数、穗长、粒数，减少不孕穗数，增产作用很大。但这时正值麦株迅速起挺、拔节，在大量增施氮肥的情况下，如果浇水时期和水量掌握不当，很容易引起徒长倒伏。针对这些情况，为了控制小麦生长发育，有些地区提出
  “头水早，二水晚”的口号，即适当提早浇返青水，延迟浇拔节水，使麦苗在拔节期长得蹲实些，是有道理的。但是如果拔节水失之过晚，也会增加无效分蘖，因此必须根据麦株生长的情况调节用水，使既能避免倒伏，又能丰产。灌浆成熟期间如果水分不足，会造成不同程度的秕粒而减产，一般农民都很重视浇这一水，如果浇后天久不下雨或有干旱热风来袭（中原冬麦区在5月下旬常有干风为害），适时再浇一次混浆水或弥缝水，对于饱满子粒还是有效的。农谚：“麦长一线，多打一半”，此时浇水，可收“麦长一线”的效果。如河南偃师新新社1958年在成熟前八、九天增浇一次弥缝水，千粒重比较不浇的重一点八克。
    种
    1958年高额丰产田所采用的都是一些老品种，改良种虽然占多数，但地方种也有一些。这充分证明只要应用先进的丰产栽培技术，现有任何品种的生产力都有可能成倍地增产，打破了已往过于低估品种生产力和适应性，认为现有良种只有亩产六、七百斤的生产力，而农家种不到五百斤就要倒伏的错误观念。
    1958年各地高产试验田所选用的品种多系秆强、抗倒伏、抗逆力强的丰产品种。就三十六块亩产三千斤以上的麦田所采用的品种来看，“碧蚂1号”和“南大2419”各占了十三块。此外还有用“中农28”、“辉县红”的。后两个品种植株均不高，茎秆强韧，对防止倒伏十分有利。“平原50”穗大、粒数多。“南大2419”穗大、粒大。这些品种分蘖力适中，茎秆也好，通过合理密植，比较容易控制其有效分蘖数，在高额丰产条件下都是有利的因素。根据高产试验田的品种的一些生物学特性表现，秆矮、秆壮、耐肥、抗病、大穗、长穗、多花、大粒等是今后选育丰产品种的主要目标。
    1958年冬小麦的高额丰产实践已经初步形成了以“密植为中心，深耕为基础，肥水是前提，品种配得当，管理紧跟上，病虫消灭光，全面保丰产”的一套综合的丰产栽培技术，但还需要在今后不断地予以充实和提高。
