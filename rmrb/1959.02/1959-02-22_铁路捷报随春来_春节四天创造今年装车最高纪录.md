Railway Triumphs Arrive with Spring
Four-Day Spring Festival Sets This Year's Highest Loading Record

    (Our dispatch) Over one million railway workers across the country stood fast at their posts during the Spring Festival, fighting valiantly and triumphantly, sounding the first battle drum for the great leap forward in railway transportation this year. According to statistics from the Ministry of Railways, during the four-day Spring Festival holiday from February 8th to 11th, the national railway freight averaged 33,183 carloads per day, 1,083 carloads more than the February planned daily average. In particular, the first day of the Spring Festival saw 34,545 carloads, setting the highest loading record this year. The Spring Festival passenger transport work on railway trunk and branch lines was also completed very well, averaging 1.65 million passengers per day, an increase of 550,000 passengers compared to normal times. During the Spring Festival, the quality, safety, and other aspects of railway transportation have also made significant progress compared to the past.
    This year's railway transportation was originally very tight, and it was even busier during the Spring Festival. In order to ensure the completion of the Spring Festival transportation tasks, railway departments in various regions made preparations earlier and more meticulously than in previous years. Party committees at the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region levels also mobilized a large number of laborers to help with loading and unloading, and arranged factory and mine production according to the Spring Festival transportation situation.
    The brilliant achievements of railway departments in this year's Spring Festival transportation have broken the customary practice of reduced freight loading during the Spring Festival in past years, greatly encouraging the determination and confidence of railway workers to make greater leaps forward in railway transportation this year. At present, railway departments have summarized the experience of this transportation, and are advancing victoriously. The transportation plans after the Spring Festival have also been completed relatively well. The Ministry of Railways instructed all regions that the success or failure of the first quarter's railway transportation plan has a great impact on the whole year, and various measures must be taken to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the first quarter's plan.

    铁路捷报随春来
    春节四天创造今年装车最高纪录
    本报讯　全国各地一百多万名铁路职工，在春节期间坚守岗位奋战，高奏凯歌，擂响了今年铁路运输大跃进的第一声战鼓。据铁道部统计，2月8日到11日的四天春节假期中，全国铁路货运每天平均装车三万三千一百八十三车，比2月份计划每天平均多装了一千零八十三车，特别是春节第一天，装了三万四千五百四十五车，创造今年以来的装车最高纪录。铁路干支线上的春节客运工作，也完成得很好，每天平均运送旅客一百六十五万人，比平时多运五十五万人。春节期内，铁路运输的质量、安全和其他各方面，也都比以前有显著进步。
    今年铁路运输本来是十分紧张的，春节期间更加繁忙。为了保证完成春节运输任务，各地铁路部门比往年更早更细致地进行了准备工作。各省、市、自治区党委也动员了大批劳动力帮助装卸，并根据春节运输的情况安排了厂矿的生产。
    铁路部门今年春节运输取得的辉煌成绩，打破了历年来春节货运装车降低的惯例，大大鼓舞了铁路职工要在今年使铁路运输有更大跃进的决心和信心。目前铁路部门已经总结了这次运输的经验，正在乘胜前进，春节以后的运输计划也完成得比较好。铁道部指示各地，第一季度铁路运输计划完成的好坏，对全年影响很大，必须采取各种措施，保证完成和超额完成第一季度的计划。
