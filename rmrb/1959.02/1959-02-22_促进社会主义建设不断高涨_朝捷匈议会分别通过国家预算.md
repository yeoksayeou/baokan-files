    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 21st - The Fifth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of Korea concluded this morning after a three-day meeting.
    The meeting passed the decision on the settlement of the 1957 national budget, the decree on the 1959 national budget, and the decree on the agricultural tax in kind, and approved the decrees of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th - At today's meeting of the Fifth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, Minister of Grain Procurement, Jeong Seong-eon, made a report on the agricultural tax in kind regarding the second item on the agenda.
    Jeong Seong-eon said: The new Agricultural Tax in Kind Law stipulates that the average ratio of the tax in kind for all crops will be reduced from 20.1% of the total production in the past to 8.4%. Among them, the tax in kind for grain is reduced from 22.4% to 10%.
    Jeong Seong-eon said: Currently, Korea's national income and accumulation mainly rely on socialist industry. This year, socialist industry accounts for an overwhelming proportion of the total national budget revenue, while the agricultural tax in kind accounts for only 0.8% of the total revenue.
    Jeong Seong-eon said that the significant reduction in the ratio of agricultural tax in kind will significantly increase the public accumulation of agricultural production cooperatives, so that they have sufficient strength to purchase cars and tractors, build irrigation projects and small power stations, construct houses and various public facilities, and will significantly increase the income of the members.
    Jeong Seong-eon said: The formulation of the new agricultural tax in kind will not only bring huge economic benefits to agricultural cooperatives, but also enable the state to obtain more commercial grain from agricultural cooperatives and members. In this way, agricultural cooperative members will purchase more industrial products, further stimulating industrial production. This will promote the rapid and balanced development of the entire national economy.
    Jeong Seong-eon said: This historically significant measure will strengthen the socialist rural front and strengthen the worker-peasant alliance.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 21st - The Czechoslovak National Assembly held its 30th session on the 19th and 20th. The main agenda of the meeting was to adopt the national budget for 1959 and re-elect the Presidium of the National Assembly.
    After hearing the report of Minister of Finance Ďuriš and conducting a full discussion, the meeting unanimously adopted the national budget for 1959.
    Before the end of the meeting, a new Presidium was elected. Fierlinger was re-elected as Chairman of the National Assembly; Vallo, Hodinová-Spurná, Polanský, Fiála, and Ziak continued to be elected as Vice-Chairmen. The newly elected Presidium consists of eighteen members.
    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 21st - The Hungarian National Assembly continued its meeting on the 20th and adopted the national budget for 1959.
    Jeno Fock, member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, pointed out during the budget discussion on the 19th that Hungary's acceleration of socialist construction depends first and foremost on the labor enthusiasm of the people. It can now be seen that the working people support the economic policies of the Party and the government, and they are all enthusiastically working hard to realize the production plan.
    Fock pointed out that from the perspective of accelerating socialist construction, how to better use existing investment is a very important issue. Some progress was made in this regard last year, but the phenomenon of dispersing the use of funds still exists. He said that it is necessary to use the investment loans obtained from the Soviet Union in a particularly planned manner in order to better develop technology, conduct industrial reorganization, and produce more economically.
    When talking about agricultural issues, Fock pointed out that the agricultural collectivization movement has recently gained development. In the future, we must continue to strengthen our work so that farmers can generally see the superiority of socialist collective management.
    At the afternoon meeting on the 20th, Prosecutor General Szenási György of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office gave a report to the parliament on the work of the procuratorate.
    Szenási said that the achievements made by the Hungarian working people in the political and economic fields under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government have created basic conditions for the continued consolidation of the rule of law. Due to the favorable situation in domestic political and economic life and the various effective measures taken by the judicial organs, the number of lawbreakers has been greatly reduced. In 1958, the number of theft, robbery, and murder offenders decreased by more than one-third compared with 1957, and the number of people who committed crimes by destroying social public property decreased by 93%. He said that the work of the judicial organs has been greatly improved.
    He pointed out that we must severely punish enemies and major criminals who disrupt social life. We have given the masterminds and chief culprits of the counter-revolution the most severe legal sanctions, but at the same time, we have given those who have been deceived the possibility of repentance and self-renewal. He said that under the influence of the increasingly stable and continuously consolidated domestic political and economic life, the number of political prisoners has been greatly reduced. However, paying attention to the activities of the enemy and severely punishing saboteurs remains an important task for us.
    The National Assembly meeting adjourned after hearing Szenási's report.

    促进社会主义建设不断高涨  朝捷匈议会分别通过国家预算
    新华社平壤21日电　朝鲜第二届最高人民会议第五次会议在举行了三天会议以后，在今天上午闭幕。
    会议通过了关于1957年国家预算结算的决定、关于1959年国家预算的法令和关于农业实物税的法令，并且批准了最高人民会议常任委员会的政令。
    新华社平壤20日电　在朝鲜第二届最高人民会议第五次会议今天的会议上，朝鲜收买粮政相郑圣彦就第二项议程作了关于农业实物税的报告。
    郑圣彦说：新农业实物税法规定，全部农作物的实物税的平均比率由过去的总生产量的20.1％降低到8.4％。其中粮食的实物税由22.4％降低到10％。
    郑圣彦说：目前朝鲜的国家收入和积累主要是依靠社会主义的工业，今年朝鲜的国家预算收入总额中来自社会主义工业的占压倒的比重，农业实物税只占收入总额的0.8％。
    郑圣彦说，农业实物税比率的显著降低，将使农业生产合作社的公共积累显著增加，以便它们有充分力量购买汽车和拖拉机，修建灌溉工程和小型发电站，建筑住宅和各种公共设施，并且将使社员的收入显著增加。
    郑圣彦说：新农业实物税的制定，不仅将使农业合作社得到巨大的经济利益，同时，国家将从农业社和社员那里得到更多的商品粮食。这样，农业社社员将购买更多的工业品，进一步刺激工业生产。这将促进整个国民经济的迅速的平衡的发展。
    郑圣彦说：这一有历史意义的措施，将加强社会主义的农村阵地，加强工农联盟。
    新华社布拉格21日电　捷克斯洛伐克国民议会在19日和20日举行了第三十次会议。会议的主要议程是通过1959年的国家预算和改选国民议会主席团。
    会议在听取了财政部长杜里什的报告，并进行了充分的讨论后，一致通过了1959年的国家预算。
    会议在结束前选出了新的主席团。费林格再次当选为国民议会主席；瓦洛、霍迪诺娃—斯普尔娜、波兰斯基、费亚拉和齐雅克继续当选为副主席。新选出的主席团由十八位委员组成。
    新华社布达佩斯21日电　匈牙利国民议会20日继续开会，通过了1959年国家预算。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党政治局委员福克·耶诺在19日讨论预算时指出，匈牙利要加速社会主义建设首先取决于人民的劳动热情，现在可以看到，劳动人民拥护党和政府的经济政策，他们都热情充沛地为实现生产计划而积极劳动着。
    福克指出，从加速社会主义建设的角度来看，如何更好地使用现有的投资是非常重要的问题。去年在这方面曾取得一些成绩，但是分散使用资金的现象还存在。他说，要特别有计划地使用从苏联得到的投资贷款，以便更好地发展技术、进行工业改组和更经济的生产。
    在谈到农业问题时福克指出，最近农业合作化运动获得了发展。今后要继续加强工作，让农民普遍看到社会主义集体经营的优越性。
    在20日下午会议上，最高检察署总检察长塞纳希·格佑向议会作了检察工作的报告。
    塞纳希说，匈牙利劳动人民在社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的领导下在政治经济方面所取得的成绩，为法治的继续巩固创造了基本条件。由于国内政治经济生活的有利形势以及司法机关所采取的多方面的有效措施，犯法的人数已大大减少。1958年偷窃抢劫和杀人犯比1957年减少了三分之一以上，因破坏社会公共财产而犯罪的人减少了93％。他说，司法机关的工作有了很大的改善。
    他指出，我们要严惩敌人和扰乱社会生活的重要罪犯。我们已给予反革命的主谋和首要分子以最严厉的法律制裁，但同时对被欺骗者给予悔过自新的可能性。他说，在国内政治经济生活日益稳定和不断巩固的影响下，政治犯大大减少了。但注意敌人的活动，严惩阴谋破坏者仍然是我们的重要任务。
    国民议会会议在听取了塞纳希的报告之后，宣告闭幕。
