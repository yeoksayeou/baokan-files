　　Golden soft hair, a delicate figure, a sweet smile on her pointed face—this is Liesel, the protagonist of the film "A Bitter Page" produced by Democratic Germany. Her experiences are so moving: when she goes astray, we feel heartache; when she awakens, we also feel joy.

　　The first time we see her, she is just a young girl of about twenty years old. Twenty years old, what a wonderful age; but unfortunately, she lived in such terrible times! From 1932 to 1933, Germany before and after Hitler came to power was mired in such deep suffering, unemployment, unemployment, unemployment, unemployment everywhere! Liesel was unemployed, her brother Paul was unemployed, and her husband Frommayer was also unemployed. Hunger and poverty forced many people to bow their heads to life, to surrender. With confused fantasies, they believed Hitler's vain and shameless propaganda and threw themselves into the arms of the Nazis. Frommayer is one of these people. This petty clerk, who was so afraid of falling into the "proletarian slum," although he also cursed the capitalists, was actually weak and submissive. When he was fired, although he was also filled with resentment and cursed the capitalists as "advancing on corpses" and "exploiters," he only cursed them behind their backs; and he cursed them only because his desire to climb up had not been satisfied, and he had tasted the bitterness of unemployment. Once he threw himself into the arms of the Nazis and rose rapidly, from squad leader to platoon leader, he immediately changed his attitude and obediently supported his Führer.

　　Liesel was different from her husband. Although a rich material life also brought her brief joy, she was the daughter of a worker, she had some communist friends, and she had been educated by them, so she was always suspicious and distrustful of the Nazis. However, she did not initially understand the warnings of her friends Tony, Max, etc., but only after she heard and witnessed many tragic facts and personally experienced many trials and tribulations did she extricate herself from that quagmire. The awakening of her soul was a painful and complex process. The film quite meticulously depicts Liesel's inner contradictions and pain. When her husband first put on the Stormtrooper uniform, the neighbors secretly peeked and talked outside the window, and she felt ashamed and complained why her husband didn't pull the curtains. However, she loved her husband, loved her children, and did not want her husband to suffer and her children to go hungry; and she herself also yearned for a peaceful and comfortable life, so when her husband became a platoon leader and the whole family moved into a luxurious and beautiful new home, she also temporarily indulged in that environment, feeling at ease dressing herself up and comfortably sitting in bed eating breakfast... Cruel facts finally made her open her eyes. She saw how the Nazis massacred communists, persecuted Jews, and even her friend Tony could not escape, and finally, their clutches touched her own relatives—her father was insulted, and her brother Paul was shot after joining the Stormtroopers because he was dissatisfied with Hitler's policies! The facts of blood awakened Liesel's heart, and she could no longer mix with these ghosts. In Paul's mourning hall, that Nazi officer was giving his insane speech again. An off-screen voice sounded: "Whoever doesn't follow us is an opponent!" Liesel turned and walked out. Yes, she would no longer follow them. She was going to embark on another path. That path was arduous, but it was also just!

　　Through the experiences of Liesel, Frommayer, Paul, and others, and the things that happened around them, the film reflects the reality of that turbulent era, exposes the conspiracy of the fascist rulers, and also shows how people from various backgrounds went astray, and some sank, while others awakened. These things, viewed today, still have practical significance. Are the personal painful experiences of the older generation of Germans not a warning bell and a lesson for the people of West Germany today?

    心灵的觉醒
    苏苹
    金色的柔发，纤丽的身材，尖尖的面孔上带着甜蜜的微笑——这是丽茜，是民主德国出品的影片“痛苦的一页”中的女主角。她的遭遇是如此令人感动：当她误入歧途时，我们心痛；当她觉醒过来时，我们也感到了欢乐。
    我们第一次看到她的时候，她不过是个二十岁左右的年青姑娘。二十岁，这是多么美妙的年华；然而不幸的是，她却生活在那样可怕的年代！1932至1933年，希特勒上台前后的德国，陷在多么深重的苦难之中，失业，失业，失业，到处都是失业！丽茜失业了，她的弟弟保尔失业了，她的丈夫弗罗梅耶也失业了。饥饿和贫困逼得许多人向生活低头了，投降了。他们带着迷茫的幻想，相信了希特勒的虚妄无耻的宣传，投入了纳粹的怀抱。弗罗梅耶便是这些人中间的一个。这个深怕自己陷入“无产阶级的穷窝”的小职员，虽然他也诅咒资本家，但实际上他却是软弱的，屈从的。他被解雇的时候，虽然也满腔愤懑地咒骂资本家是“踏着尸体前进”，是“剥削者”，但也只不过在背后骂骂而已；而他诅咒他们，也是因为他向上爬的愿望没有得到满足，尝到了失业的苦味所致。一旦他投入纳粹的怀抱，并且扶摇直上，由小队长升为中队长时，他便立刻改变了态度，俯首贴耳地拥护他的元首了。
    丽茜和她的丈夫不一样。虽然丰美的物质生活也给她带来了短暂的欢乐，然而她是一个工人的女儿，她有一些共产党员的朋友，她从他们那里受到过教育，因此她对纳粹始终是怀疑的，不相信的。不过对于她的朋友托尼、麦克斯等的警告，她最初并不了解，而是在她耳闻目睹了许多惨痛的事实，并且亲身经受了许多磨折之后，她才从那泥淖里自拔出来。她的心灵的觉醒，是经历了一个痛苦复杂的过程的。影片相当细致地刻划了丽茜内心的矛盾和痛苦。当她的丈夫第一次穿上冲锋队制服的时候，邻居们在窗外偷偷窥视议论，她也感到羞耻，埋怨丈夫为什么不把窗帘拉上。然而她爱丈夫，爱孩子，她不愿丈夫痛苦，孩子挨饿；而她自己，也渴求着安恬舒适的生活，因此当丈夫成为中队长，全家搬入豪华漂亮的新居之后，她也暂时沉迷在那个环境之中，心安理得地打扮自己，舒舒服服地坐在床上吃早餐……残酷的事实，终于使她睁开眼来。她看到纳粹怎样残杀共产党人，迫害犹太人，连她的朋友托尼也不能幸免，而最后，他们的魔掌竟触到自己的亲人身上——父亲遭到了侮辱，弟弟保尔在参加了冲锋队之后，因为对希特勒的政策不满意，也被枪杀了！血的事实使丽茜的心苏醒过来，她不能再和这些人鬼混下去。在保尔的灵堂里，那个纳粹军官又在发表他的疯狂的演说。画外音响着：“不跟我们走的就是反对者！”丽茜却反身走了出去。是的，她不会再跟他们走了。她要走上另外一条道路。那条道路是艰苦的，但是也是正义的！
    影片通过丽茜、弗罗梅耶、保尔等人的遭遇和他们周围发生的事情，反映了那动乱年代的实况，揭露了法西斯统治者的阴谋，也显示了各种不同出身的人怎样走入歧途，而且有的沉沦了，有的却觉醒过来。这些事情，在今天来看，仍然是有现实意义的。老一辈德国人的亲身的痛苦的经历，对于现在西德的人来说，不是一次警钟和一个教训么？
