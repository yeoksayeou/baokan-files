Spring is here!
Report, report, report, spring has arrived!
Firecrackers are set off everywhere!
Setting off firecrackers, it's really lively,
The art programs have singing and dancing.
What are we singing?
Singing about increased production,
Last year's bumper harvest didn't make us complacent at all!
Last year's enthusiasm soared to the sky,
This year we will ride a rocket and rush forward!
What are we dancing?
Dancing for the Great Leap Forward,
This year we will be even more energetic than last year!
Last year we launched satellites,
This year planets will go to the sun to report good news!
Right, right, right, spring is here,
The spring light has reached Hainan Island,
The river thaws in "Seventh Nine,"
The geese arrive in "Eighth Nine,"
Production in the north must also start early!
"The early bird catches the worm,"
Early movers will have good production!
The spring breeze is gentle, the spring light is warm,
A good life depends entirely on increased production.
The whole year's work depends on a good start in spring,
Time flies and never returns!
Three years of hard work will benefit thousands of years,
Our eyes are looking far ahead!
Celebrating the Spring Festival, offering new congratulations,
Everyone says this year will definitely be extraordinary!
Celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China,
Go all out and offer gifts on National Day!
Work, work, work, lift up your spirits,
We are good people of socialism!
Clever minds and diligent hands,
Reshaping mountains and overturning seas, shaking the earth is us!
We can do it, we will succeed,
The Party's leadership is the most brilliant!
Chairman Mao leads us forward,
The spring is warm and the flowers are blooming, and the red sun is rising in the east!

    春天来了（快板）
    老舍报报报，春来到，四面八方放花炮！放花炮，真热闹，文艺节目有唱又有跳。唱什么？唱增产，去年丰收咱们一点不自满！去年干劲冲破天，今年要骑着火箭朝前赶！跳什么？跳跃进，今年要比去年更带劲！去年放的不过是卫星，今年行星去向太阳报喜信！对对对，春来了，春光已到海南岛，“七九”河开，“八九”雁就来，北方生产动手也要早！
  “早起来的鸟儿有食吃”，早动手的人民生产好！春风和，春光暖，生活要好全靠多生产。一年之计在于春，光阴一去不复返！苦战三年造福千百年，咱们的眼睛看得就是远！过春节，道新喜，齐说今年一定了不起！庆祝建国十周年，鼓足干劲，好在国庆去献礼！干干干，抖精神，咱们是社会主义的好人民！心又巧，手又勤，倒海移山，惊天动地是咱们！咱们干，咱们行，党的领导最英明！毛主席带着咱们走，春暖花开红日正东升！
