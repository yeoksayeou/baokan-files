Xinhua News Agency, February 3rd, Moscow, February 2nd (TASS): The Soviet Basketball Association sent a telegram to the President of the International Amateur Basketball Federation (FIBA), Mr. Graeme, and Secretary-General Mr. Jones, protesting the decision made by the FIBA Central Bureau regarding the basketball teams of the Soviet Union and Bulgaria.

    The telegram stated: “The Soviet Basketball Association, Soviet basketball players, and the sports community have learned with anger of the unprecedented decision in international sports made by the FIBA Central Bureau against the basketball teams of the Soviet Union and Bulgaria. We believe that the practice of canceling the scores of the Soviet team, which had already practically won the world championship, is the FIBA Executive Committee pursuing a political line that violates all sports principles and defies reason.
    The Soviet Basketball Association announces a firm protest against the above decision. We believe that the FIBA Central Bureau should be held responsible for these actions.”

    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, February 3rd: The Basketball Department of the Bulgarian Sports Association sent a telegram to FIBA on February 3rd, severely protesting FIBA’s shameless decision to unreasonably cancel all scores of the Bulgarian and Soviet basketball teams in this year's World Basketball Championship under the pretext that the Bulgarian and Soviet basketball teams refused to play against the "Taiwan team" that represents no one.

    The protest telegram stated: “There is only one China in the world, and that is the People's Republic of China. Only the basketball organization affiliated with the All-China Sports Federation has the right to represent Chinese athletes in FIBA. Therefore, it is entirely correct for the Bulgarian basketball team to refuse to play against the 'Taiwan team,' which can represent no one but itself."
    FIBA’s decision also grossly violates Article 2 of the regulations of the Third World Men’s Basketball Championship: “The ranking of teams will be based on the number of points scored—two points for a win, one point for a loss, and zero points for absence.”
    The telegram finally and most firmly demanded that FIBA cancel this extremely unfair decision and rank the teams according to the regulations of the Third World Men’s Basketball Championship.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 3rd, Santiago: The FIBA Central Bureau held a meeting in Santiago, Chile, on January 31st, and illegally decided to cancel all points earned by the Soviet and Bulgarian basketball teams in the Third World Basketball Championship, and rank these two teams as the last two in this championship.
    The Central Bureau made this illegal decision by a vote of six to two. The excuse was that the Soviet and Bulgarian basketball teams refused to play against the Chiang gang basketball team that represents no one in this championship.
    FIBA violated its organizational charter, illegally recognized the Taiwan Chiang gang sports organization, and allowed the Chiang gang to participate in this World Basketball Championship held in Santiago.
    Before the competition, the basketball associations of the Soviet Union and Bulgaria had already strongly protested FIBA’s practice, pointing out that the Chiang gang basketball team does not represent anyone and has no right to participate in the World Basketball Championship; this right should belong to the People's Republic of China; and demanded that the Federation make arrangements according to this request, but the Federation insisted on carrying out the conspiracy to create "two Chinas."
    The Soviet basketball team achieved brilliant victories in the final stage of this championship, successively defeating Brazil, the runner-up of the previous championship and the 1958 South American basketball champion, and the United States, the world champion of the previous championship, maintaining a record of winning every game. The Bulgarian team's performance was second only to these three teams.
    While competing, the Soviet and Bulgarian teams patiently waited for FIBA to change its wrong position, but the Federation not only persisted in its errors but also further carried out conspiracies. After the Soviet and Bulgarian teams refused to play against the Chiang gang on the 30th and 31st, the Federation shamelessly announced that the Soviet and Bulgarian teams had lost to the Chiang gang basketball team, which represents no one, by a score of zero to two, and finally made the decision to cancel all the points of these two teams, depriving the Soviet Union of the right to be named world basketball champion.
    The FIBA Central Bureau also decided that the Soviet Union and Bulgaria must provide the Federation with a written guarantee that they are willing to play against any team participating in the competition before each international basketball competition organized by FIBA in the future.
    This series of actions by FIBA further demonstrates that it is shamefully playing political conspiracies under the guise of "sports has nothing to do with politics" under the manipulation of American imperialist elements.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 3rd, Santiago: The American-manipulated FIBA unreasonably decided on January 31st to award the "championship" of the 1959 World Basketball Championship to the Brazilian basketball team, which had been defeated by the Soviet team, while ranking the real world champion, the Soviet team, at the bottom.
    The Brazilian team had been defeated by the Soviet team twice in this championship. Once in the group elimination round (64 to 73) and once in the final stage (63 to 66).
    The Soviet team was the only team that did not lose a single game in the final round. In addition to defeating the previous world runner-up and 1958 South American champion Brazil, it also defeated the original world champion, the United States, by an overwhelming score of 62 to 37.
    In this championship, the Soviet and Bulgarian teams adhered to a righteous position and refused to play against the Chiang gang team, which represents no one. However, the FIBA Central Bureau, under the manipulation of the American chairman, shamelessly announced that the Soviet and Bulgarian teams each lost a game and cancelled all the points of the Soviet and Bulgarian teams in the championship, thus later allowing the already defeated Brazilian team to win the world basketball "championship" and the United States to win the "runner-up."
    The United States has exhausted all means, but it cannot cover people's eyes and ears. Even the American "New York Times" had to admit in its commentary on this championship: "This World Basketball Championship ended with a communist victory in the eyes of fair people."
    At the meeting of the Central Bureau, the American representative also attempted to prohibit the Soviet and Bulgarian basketball teams from participating in international competitions for the next four years, thereby eliminating the strong opponents of the United States in the 1960 Olympic basketball competition.

    国际篮联非法剥夺苏联队世界冠军和苏保队积分
    苏保篮球组织提出严正抗议
    新华社3日讯塔斯社莫斯科2日讯：苏联篮球协会打电报给国际业余篮球联合会主席格雷姆和秘书长琼斯，抗议国际业余篮球联合会中央局对苏联和保加利亚篮球代表队所作的决定。
    电报中说：“苏联篮球协会、苏联篮球运动员和体育界怀着愤怒的心情得知国际业余篮球联合会中央局对苏联和保加利亚篮球代表队作出的国际体育运动中史无前例的决定。我们认为取消了在实际已经取得世界冠军的苏联代表队在锦标赛中的得分的作法，是国际业余篮球联合会在执行违反一切体育运动原则和违背理智的政治路线。
    苏联篮球协会宣布坚决抗议上述决定。我们认为国际业余篮球联合会中央局应对这些行动负责。”
    新华社索非亚3日电保加利亚体育协会篮球部3日打电报给国际业余篮球联合会，严重抗议国际业余篮球联合会借口保加利亚和苏联篮球队拒绝同不代表任何人的
  “台湾队”进行比赛而无理取消他们在今年的世界篮球锦标赛中所有得分的无耻决定。
    抗议电报中说：“世界上只有一个中国，那就是中华人民共和国。只有中华全国体育总会所属的篮球组织才有权在国际业余篮球联合会中代表中国运动员。因此，保加利亚篮球队拒绝同除了代表自己外不能代表任何人的‘台湾队’进行比赛，是完全正确的”。
    国际业余篮球联合会的这个决定还粗暴地违反了第三届世界男子篮球锦标赛章程第二条的规定：“代表队的名次将根据得分多少划分——获胜得二分，败北得一分，缺席零分”。
    电报最后最坚决地要求国际业余篮球联合会取消这个极不公正的决定，并根据第三届世界男子篮球锦标赛章程排定代表队的名次。
    新华社3日讯圣地亚哥消息：国际业余篮球联合会1月31日在圣地亚哥（智利）举行中央局会议，非法决定取消苏联和保加利亚篮球队在第三届世界篮球锦标赛中所获得的全部积分，并把这两队的名次列为这次锦标赛的最后两名。
    中央局的会议是以六票对二票作出这个非法决定的。借口是苏联和保加利亚篮球队拒绝在这次锦标赛中同不代表任何人的蒋帮篮球队比赛。
    国际业余篮球联合会违背了组织章程，非法承认台湾蒋帮体育组织，并且让蒋帮参加这次在圣地亚哥举行的世界篮球锦标赛。
    早在比赛以前，苏联和保加利亚的篮球协会就已经坚决抗议国际业余篮球联合会的这种做法，指出蒋帮篮球队不代表任何人，它无权参加世界篮球锦标赛，这个权利应属于中华人民共和国；要求联合会根据这个要求做出安排，但是联合会仍坚持进行制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    苏联篮球队在这次锦标赛的决赛阶段中取得了光辉的胜利，先后击败了上届亚军、1958年南美篮球冠军巴西和上届世界冠军美国，保持每战每胜的纪录。保加利亚队的成绩仅次于这三个队。
    苏联队和保加利亚队在进行比赛的同时，仍耐心地等待国际业余篮球联合会改变这种错误立场，但是联合会不但坚持错误而且进一步进行阴谋，30日和31日苏联队和保加利亚队拒绝同蒋帮比赛后，联合会竟无耻地宣布苏联队和保加利亚队分别以零比二败给不代表任何人的蒋帮篮球队，并且最后作出了取消这两队全部积分的决定，剥夺苏联获得世界篮球冠军的称号的权利。
    国际业余篮球联合会中央局还作出决定，要苏联和保加利亚今后在国际业余篮球联合会主办的每次国际篮球比赛前向联合会书面保证他们愿意同参加比赛的任何队比赛。
    国际业余篮球联合会的这一系列行为进一步表明了它在美国帝国主义分子操纵下，借着“体育与政治无关”的幌子可耻地玩弄着政治阴谋。
    新华社3日讯圣地亚哥消息：美国操纵的国际业余篮球联合会1月31日无理决定，让被苏联队击败过的巴西篮球队获得1959年世界篮球锦标赛的“冠军”，而把真正的世界冠军苏联队排在最后的名次。
    巴西队在这次锦标赛中曾两次败给苏联队。一次在小组淘汰赛中（六十四比七十三），一次在决赛阶段（六十三比六十六）。
    苏联队是决赛交锋中唯一没有输过一场的队。除了击败了上届世界亚军和1958年南美冠军巴西队外，还曾以六十二分比三十七分的压倒优势击败了原来的世界冠军美国队。
    在这次锦标赛中，苏联队和保加利亚队坚持正义立场，拒绝同不代表任何人的蒋帮队比赛，但是，国际业余篮球联合会的中央局在美国主席操纵下竟无耻地宣布苏联队和保加利亚队各输一场，并且取消苏联和保加利亚队在锦标赛中的全部积分，从而后来使已经输过的巴西队得到了世界篮球“冠军”，美国获得了“亚军”。
    美国施尽各种手段也掩不住人们的耳目。甚至，连美国的“纽约时报”在评论这次锦标赛时也不得不承认说：“这次世界篮球锦标赛在公正的人们的眼光里是以共产党的胜利而告终的。”
    在中央局的会议上，美国代表还妄想禁止苏联和保加利亚篮球队在今后四年中参加国际比赛的权利，从而为美国除掉在1960年奥运会篮球比赛中的强大对手。
