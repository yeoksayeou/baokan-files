    Do Everything Possible to Achieve High Yields of Rapeseed
    Hubei Strives for Balanced Production Increase Through Visits and Comparisons  Sichuan Mobilizes Large Numbers of Laborers for Crash Topdressing and Irrigation
    Jiangxi Summarizes Experiences and Formulates Rapeseed Management Plans  Zhejiang's Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou Area Launches a Grand Competition to Cultivate Spring Flowers

    (Our newspaper, Wuhan, 15th) Hubei Province is currently focusing on the cultivation and management of rapeseed. Through on-site evaluation competitions, efforts are being made to achieve balanced production increases, ensure seed preservation and harvests, and strive for a bumper rapeseed harvest.

    By the end of January, of the province's more than five million mu of rapeseed, over three million seven hundred thousand mu had received one topdressing; over one million one hundred thousand mu had received two topdressings; and approximately ten thousand mu of satellite fields had received topdressing three times or more. To protect rapeseed seedlings from the winter, many areas have built windbreaks or used methods such as smoke, adding grass ash, and covering with wheat straw to prevent frost damage.  Hanchuan County organized an 11,000-strong army for rapeseed management, ensuring that the county's rapeseed was basically unaffected by frost. Songzi County, known for its high rapeseed yields, has taken measures to keep 70% of its rapeseed warm and frost-free, applying over 10 million dan of warming fertilizer to 70,000 mu of rapeseed, and also using over 140,000 jin of buckwheat straw to cover the more tender rapeseed seedlings. The county has a county party secretary specifically in charge of rapeseed production, and each people's commune has also established a rapeseed production command headed by the commune party secretary. The county has also established a 30,000-strong special rapeseed management team.

    This year, Hubei Province's rapeseed planting area has more than doubled compared to last year's two million three hundred thousand mu, and most of it has been deeply ploughed, densely planted, and adequately base-fertilized. Generally, there are between 20,000 and 30,000 plants per mu, about twice as dense as last year. Seedling transplantation accounts for about one million six hundred thousand mu, an increase of seven times compared to the two hundred thousand mu planted last year. According to statistics at the end of January, first-class seedlings, which are growing robustly, free of pests and diseases, and have about eight true leaves, account for nearly 40% of the total area; second-class seedlings with more than five true leaves account for about 33%. Now that rapeseed is not far from bolting and budding, various localities are strengthening cultivation management before budding on the basis of doing a good job in keeping warm and preventing frost.

    The main problems in rapeseed management at present are: some areas emphasize satellite fields but neglect large-area fields; emphasize transplanted rapeseed but neglect direct-sown rapeseed; and emphasize early-planted rapeseed but neglect late-planted rapeseed. In order to promote balanced production increase over large areas, many areas launched a rapeseed evaluation competition around the Spring Festival, comparing vigorous growth, comparing cultivation management, and comparing the elimination of backward seedlings.

    (Our newspaper, Chengdu, 15th) Sichuan Province's thirty million mu of wheat and rapeseed are now jointing and bolting, entering a crucial period for increasing production throughout the year.  Local party committees have recently mobilized about 60% of the labor force to launch a crash campaign centered on topdressing and irrigation.

    Daxian, Neijiang, Leshan, Yibin, Ya'an, and other regions have recently transferred hundreds of thousands of troops to reinforce field management. Wheat and rapeseed have generally been topdressed once or twice, and pests have been vigorously controlled and irrigation carried out, so that the original three types of wheat and rapeseed seedlings have been rapidly reduced. At present, first-class seedlings generally rise to more than 50%, and some areas reach more than 70%.

    In this crash campaign, leading comrades of party committees at all levels went to the countryside and fields. Four secretaries and four ministers of the Meishan County Party Committee participated in the crash campaign, and leading cadres of the Mabian County Party Committee led 253 county-level agency cadres to participate in topdressing and irrigation. After the responsible comrades of the Party committee went to the countryside and the fields, they not only helped the commune to arrange labor forces, but also assisted in the establishment of a responsibility system for field management, and organized inspections, evaluations and competitions, so that the work was done meticulously and scientifically. The Langzhong County Party Committee summarized and promoted four packages (inspection team cadres package communes, commune cadres package management areas, management areas package work groups, work groups package fields), three to fields (fertilizer production to fields, measures to fields, tasks to fields), three definitions (defined person, defined time, defined quality), three combinations (topdressing combined with irrigation, combined with suppression, pest control combined with weeding).

    (Our newspaper, Nanchang, 15th) Jiangxi Province strives for a large-scale, high-yield rapeseed harvest this year. At present, the province's three million five hundred thousand mu of rapeseed has been weeded two to three times, and an average of more than 300 dan of fertilizer has been applied per mu. Due to good cultivation and management, rapeseed is more than one foot tall, grows lushly, and is covered with yellow flowers.

    This year, Jiangxi Province has implemented many advanced technical measures for rapeseed sowing, not only generally advancing sowing by one season and applying sufficient base fertilizer, but also achieving deep plowing and dense planting. Generally, deep plowing is six to seven inches, and some are one foot to one and a half feet. The number of plants per mu has increased from 5,000 last year to about 40,000 to 50,000. Hukou County, which had a rapeseed yield of 100 jin per mu last year, proposed to produce 300 jin per mu this year, and the county organized more than 20,000 people to be specifically responsible for field management of rapeseed. After summarizing past experience, the Duchang County Party Committee formulated rapeseed field management rules to ensure high rapeseed yields.

    The Wenzhen Commune in Linchuan County organized a technical team of more than 100 people to check the growth of rapeseed and impart cultivation management techniques.

    (Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 15th) Members of the people's communes in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area, the main rapeseed producing area of Zhejiang Province, have overcome complacency and strengthened the mid-term cultivation and management of rapeseed.

    This year, more than one million three hundred thousand mu of rapeseed fields in Jiaxing Prefecture have generally been topdressed twice, and some have been topdressed three to five times.  Ditching and soil cultivation and grass cover for frost protection are also done earlier and better than last year. According to recent inspections, about 30% of the rapeseed in the district has more than ten seedlings per plant, and many have initially appeared flower buds. These rapeseed fields have about 30,000 seedlings planted per mu, three times more than last year, and the yield is expected to increase greatly.

    Due to the good growth of rapeseed this year, complacency has arisen among some commune members, so field cultivation work has been relaxed. The Jiaxing Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered this situation early and required all localities to carry out field rectification to overcome complacency through field "consultations," inspections and evaluations, and organized visits. At present, many people's communes have established or improved spring flower cultivation professional teams and established a production responsibility system. Jiaxing, Wuxing, Pinghu and other counties have also carried out competitions between communes and communes, and between production teams and production teams, to cultivate spring flowers. The members put forward specific measures and are determined to overfulfill the production increase target. Many communes are conducting large-scale field inspections, classifying and ranking rapeseed, finding out the reasons for the few third-class seedlings, contracting to cultivate them, and eliminating them within a time limit. Through inspection, the members overcame complacency, and many communes reappeared in a cultivation upsurge.

    千方百计叫油菜高产
    湖北通过参观评比力争平衡增产  四川调集大批劳力突击追肥灌溉
    江西总结经验制订油菜管理规划  浙江杭嘉湖开展培养春花大竞赛
    本报武汉15日电　湖北省各地正抓紧油菜的培育管理。通过现场评比竞赛，做到平衡增产，保种保收，争取油菜大丰收。
    到1月底止，全省五百多万亩油菜，有三百七十多万亩追了一道肥；有一百一十多万亩追了二道肥；十万亩左右的卫星田已追肥三次以上。为了保护油菜苗安全过冬，许多地区搭了防风障或用烟熏、加盖草木灰、铺麦秸等办法防止霜冻。汉川县曾组织了一万一千多人的油菜管理大军，使全县油菜基本没有受到霜冻损害。以油菜高产著称的松滋县有70％的油菜做好保温防冻，七万亩油菜施了保温肥一千多万担，还用了十四万多斤荞麦秸铺盖较幼嫩的油菜苗。这个县有一个县委书记专管油菜生产，各人民公社也设立了由公社党委书记领导的油菜生产指挥部。全县还建立了三万多人的专管油菜班子。
    湖北省今年油菜种植面积比去年的二百三十多万亩增加一倍多，大部做到深耕、密植、底肥足。每亩大都在二万株到三万株，较去年密一倍左右。育苗移栽的达一百六十万亩左右，较去年栽的二十万亩增加七倍。据1月底统计，生长肥壮、无病虫害、有真叶八片左右的一类苗，占总面积的近40％；五片真叶以上的二类苗占33％左右。现在油菜抽苔现蕾为期不远，各地正在做好保温防冻基础上，抓紧加强现蕾前的培育管理。
    当前油菜管理上的主要问题是：有的地区只重卫星田，轻大面积田；重移栽的，轻直播的；重早栽的，轻迟栽的。为促进大面积平衡增产，许多地区于春节前后开展一个比生长健壮、比培育管理、比消灭落后苗的油菜评比竞赛。

    本报成都15日电　四川省三千万亩小麦和油菜正在拔节抽苔，进入了全年增产的关键时期，各地党委最近调集约有60％的人力，掀起以追肥和浇灌为中心的突击性运动。
    达县、内江、乐山、宜宾、雅安等专区，最近都抽调了数十万大军增援田间管理，小麦、油菜已普遍追肥一两次，并大力防治虫害和进行浇灌，使原有小麦和油菜的三类苗迅速减少。目前，一类苗一般上升到50％以上，部分地区达到70％以上。
    在这次突击运动中，各级党委的领导同志纷纷下乡下田。眉山县委有四个书记和四个部长参加了突击运动，马边县委的领导干部带领二百五十三名县级机关干部参加追肥和浇灌工作。党委负责同志下乡下田以后，不但具体帮助公社安排劳动力，还协助建立了田间管理的责任制度，组织检查评比和竞赛，使工作做的又细致又科学。阆中县委在运动中总结推广了四包（检查团的干部包公社、公社干部包管理区、管理区包作业组、作业组包田块），三到田（积肥造肥到田、措施到田、任务到田），三定（定人、定时、定质），三结合（追肥结合浇灌、结合镇压、治虫结合除草）。

    本报南昌15日电　江西省力争今年油菜大面积高额丰产。目前，全省三百五十万亩油菜已普遍锄草二至三次，平均每亩施肥三百多担。由于培育和管理好，油菜已有一尺多高，长得青葱茁壮，遍地开满了黄花。
    江西省今年油菜播种实行了许多先进技术措施，不仅普遍提前了一个季节播种，施足了底肥，而且还做到了深耕和密植。一般深耕六至七寸，有的有一尺到一尺五寸。每亩株数由去年的五千株增加到四至五万株左右。去年油菜亩产百斤的湖口县，提出了今年亩产三百斤，全县组织了二万多人专门负责油菜的田间管理。都昌县委在总结了往年经验后，制订了油菜田间管理规则，以确保油菜高产。
    临川县塭圳公社组织了一支一百多人的技术队伍，一面检查油菜生长情况，一面传授培育管理技术。

    本报杭州15日电　浙江省油菜主要产区杭嘉湖地区各人民公社的社员，克服自满思想，加强油菜的中期培育管理。
    今年嘉兴专区一百三十多万亩油菜田已普遍追肥两次，部分追肥三次到五次，挖沟培土和盖草防冻工作也比去年做得早做得好。据最近检查，全区约30％油菜，每株有苗叶十张以上，很多已初现花蕾。这些油菜田每亩植苗三万株左右，比去年多三倍，产量可望大大提高。
    由于今年油菜生长好，在部分社员中产生了自满情绪，因此放松了田间培育工作。中共嘉兴地委及早发现了这一情况，要求各地通过田头“会诊”、检查评比、组织参观等办法，开展田头整风，克服自满思想。目前许多人民公社成立或健全了春花培育专业队，建立了生产责任制。嘉兴、吴兴、平湖等县还开展了公社和公社、生产队和生产队间培育春花的竞赛，社员们提出具体措施，决心超额完成增产指标。许多公社正在开展田间大检查，把油菜进行分类排队，对少数三类苗找出原因，包干培育，限期消灭。通过检查，社员们克服了自满思想，许多公社又重新出现了培育高潮。
