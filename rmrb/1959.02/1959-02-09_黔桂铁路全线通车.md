Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, February 7th: The Duyun to Guiyang section of the Qian-Gui Railway was officially opened to traffic today. More than 20,000 people of various ethnic groups gathered at the square in front of the Guiyang Railway Station to hold a grand opening ceremony. With this, the entire 605-kilometer-long Qian-Gui Railway is fully open to traffic.

Today, Guiyang City, the southwestern mountain city surrounded by mountains, appeared particularly lively. In particular, the newly built and majestic Guiyang Railway Station was decorated even more beautifully and spectacularly with countless colorful flags and lanterns. At 10 a.m., the opening ceremony began. Zhou Lin, First Secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Guizhou Province, warmly congratulated the early completion and full opening of the railway that traverses the mountains and ridges at the meeting. He emphasized that the opening of the Qian-Gui Railway is a major achievement in the socialist construction of the motherland and the result of the firm implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction by the people of all ethnic groups in the province and all railway workers. At the same time, it marks the gradual improvement of Guizhou's transportation landscape and is also a powerful proof of the victory of the people of all ethnic groups over nature. Liu Shenghua, Director of the Guiyang Railway Bureau, stated at the meeting on behalf of all the railway bureau's employees that under the leadership of the Party and with the strong support of the people of all ethnic groups, they will strive to build more steel transportation lines on the Guizhou Plateau as soon as possible. Wu Tongming (Miao nationality), Deputy Director of the Guizhou Provincial Department of Justice, spoke at the meeting on behalf of the more than four million minority people of the province, saying that the full opening of the Qian-Gui Railway has realized the long-cherished wishes of the minority people of the province. He said that before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionaries dispatched grain and funds every year but failed to complete this railway, but after liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, it was quickly completed, which is another proof of the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

Afterwards, a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held. As the colored ribbon was cut, a float dressed in festive costumes, with a long whistle, slowly started and headed south.

The Duyun to Guiyang section of the Qian-Gui Railway completed the track-laying task half a year ahead of schedule on the last day of 1958. This railway started temporary freight transportation from New Year's Day 1959, and then started temporary passenger transportation on January 15th. In the future, there will be two pairs of passenger trains operating daily between Guiyang via Duyun and Liuzhou in Guangxi, and there will also be several freight trains entering Guiyang City every day.

    黔桂铁路全线通车
    新华社贵阳7日电　黔桂铁路都匀到贵阳段今天宣告正式通车。二万多各族人民欢聚在贵阳火车站前广场上，隆重举行了通车典礼。至此，全长六百零五公里的黔桂铁路全线通了车。
    今天，这座被群山环抱的西南山城——贵阳市，显得格外热闹。特别是新建的巍峨的贵阳火车站，被无数五彩缤纷的旗帜和彩灯打扮得更加美丽和壮观。上午十时，通车典礼开始。中共贵州省委第一书记、贵州省省长周林在大会上热烈祝贺这条穿越崇山峻岭的铁路提前修通和全线正式通车。他着重指出：黔桂铁路的通车，是祖国社会主义建设的一项重大成就，是全省各族人民和全体铁路职工坚决贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的结果。同时，它标志着贵州的交通面貌正在逐步改善，也是各族人民战胜自然的有力证明。贵阳铁路局局长刘圣化在大会上代表全铁路局职工表示，在党的领导下，在各族人民的大力支持下，争取早日在贵州高原修建起更多的钢铁运输线。贵州省司法厅副厅长吴通明（苗族），代表全省四百多万少数民族人民在大会上讲话说：黔桂铁路全线通车，实现了全省少数民族人民多年来的愿望。他说，解放前，国民党反动派年年派粮派款，没有修通这条铁路，而解放后，在中国共产党的领导下，很快就修通了，这是社会主义制度无比优越的又一证明。
    接着，举行了剪彩仪式。随着彩绸的剪断，一列披着节日盛装的彩车，汽笛长鸣，徐徐开动，向南而去。
    黔桂铁路都匀到贵阳段，整整提前半年在1958年最后一天完成铺轨任务。这条铁路从1959年元旦起，就开始了临时货运，随后在1月15日又开始临时客运。今后，从贵阳经都匀到广西的柳州之间，每天将有两对客车对开，每天驶入贵阳市的货车也将有数列。
