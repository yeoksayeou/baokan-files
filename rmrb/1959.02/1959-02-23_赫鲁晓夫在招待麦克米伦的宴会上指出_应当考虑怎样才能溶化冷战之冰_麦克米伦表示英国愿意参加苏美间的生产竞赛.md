Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd - TASS reports: British Prime Minister Macmillan paid a visit to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev at the Kremlin on the afternoon of the 21st and held talks with him. Prior to this, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd paid a visit to Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko.

The talks between the heads of the Soviet and British governments lasted approximately forty minutes. Present on the Soviet side were Foreign Minister Gromyko and Soviet Ambassador to Britain Malik; on the British side were Foreign Secretary Lloyd and British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Reilly.

Subsequently, Khrushchev held a banquet at the Grand Kremlin Palace to entertain the British Prime Minister and his entourage.

Khrushchev and Macmillan spoke at the banquet.

Khrushchev said that it had been thirty years since Mr. Macmillan's first visit to the Soviet Union. During this period, a world war took place, in which the Soviet Union and Britain formed an alliance against a common enemy - Hitler's Germany and imperialist Japan. This was a good example of cooperation between countries with different social systems. Unfortunately, relations between the Soviet Union and Britain became strained after the war.

Khrushchev said that now is not the time to discuss how this happened and why it happened. We should jointly consider how to melt the ice of the "Cold War" that has formed. He said that if we can do this, then many obstacles will be overcome in normalizing the overall international situation and in resolving important international issues that cause differences between countries and between the Soviet Union and Britain. We believe that all the necessary conditions exist at present to make this possible. It should be said that humanity has approached a stage in its life where it can prevent the outbreak of war. For all countries and peoples, resolving this task is a matter of vital importance without exception.

Khrushchev pointed out that the visit of Macmillan and his entourage to the Soviet Union makes it possible for the Soviet and British sides to discuss many issues in bilateral relations, as well as a wide range of international issues. He said that our two sides often have differences of opinion, but this should not discourage us. In our opinion, disagreements in viewpoints make consultations even more urgent in order to resolve these disagreements. We should understand each other well and make the contributions that our two peoples should make to the cause of universal peace.

Khrushchev said that our visit to Britain in the spring of 1956 was precisely for this purpose. It has been three years since then. Relations between our two countries have been in a state of semi-freeze. The generally cold climate in international relations has contributed to this situation in many ways. Now many people are talking about a "thaw," and we believe that the British Prime Minister's visit to the Soviet Union is also the result of this "thaw."

Khrushchev said that the Soviet government has advocated and will continue to advocate meetings and contacts between leaders of various countries. The Soviet government believes that this is an effective means of resolving differences and easing international tensions.

Khrushchev concluded by expressing the hope that the British Prime Minister's visit will contribute to the development and strengthening of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Britain, and will be an important contribution to creating a better international environment to strengthen universal peace.

Macmillan said in his speech that the whole world has undergone tremendous changes since his last visit to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has become the second largest industrial power in the world. The Soviet Union's technological progress in aviation, general machinery manufacturing, construction, and industrial organization has been universally admired.

Macmillan said that Britain is very willing to participate in the production competition between the Soviet Union and other countries in the world, especially with the United States, which Khrushchev often emphasizes. He said, "We would rather have this kind of competition than any other kind of competition."

He said, "We are not afraid to compete with other countries in our way of life, in our economy, and with our allies. I think competition in these areas can only bring benefits."

Macmillan then said to Khrushchev, "We can do a lot of work together, and I hope that we can focus our attention on the issues that unite us, rather than on the issues that divide us."

    赫鲁晓夫在招待麦克米伦的宴会上指出
    应当考虑怎样才能溶化冷战之冰
    麦克米伦表示英国愿意参加苏美间的生产竞赛
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：英国首相麦克米伦在21日下午到克里姆林宫拜会了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫，并且同他进行了谈话。在这以前，英国外交大臣劳埃德拜会了苏联外交部长葛罗米柯。
    苏英两国政府首脑的谈话进行了大约四十分钟。谈话时在座的苏联方面有外交部长葛罗米柯和苏联驻英国大使马立克；英国方面有外交大臣劳埃德和英国驻苏联大使赖利。
    随后，赫鲁晓夫在大克里姆林宫举行宴会，招待英国首相和他的随行人员。
    赫鲁晓夫和麦克米伦先后在宴会席上讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫说，自从麦克米伦先生第一次访问苏联以来已经三十年了。在这个时期中发生了一次世界大战，在这次战争中苏英两国曾结成联盟反对共同的敌人——希特勒德国和帝国主义日本。这是社会制度不同的国家之间进行的一次很好的合作。遗憾的是，战争结束后苏英两国之间的关系尖锐化了。
    赫鲁晓夫说，现在不是谈这种情况是怎样发生和为什么发生的时候。我们应该共同考虑一下怎样做才能溶化已经结成的“冷战”之冰。他说，如果我们能够做到这一点，那么，在使整个国际局势正常化方面，在解决引起国与国之间、引起苏英两国之间分歧的重要的国际问题方面，就会克服不少障碍。我们认为，目前具备可以作到这一点的一切必要条件。应该说，人类在自己的生活中已经走近了这样一个阶段，在这个阶段他们能够防止战争的发生。对各国和各国人民说来，解决这项任务无例外地都是切身重要的事业。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，麦克米伦和他的随行人员对苏联的访问，使得苏英双方有可能讨论两国关系方面的许多问题，以及广泛的国际问题。他说，我们双方的态度往往有分歧，但是，这不应当使我们气馁。在我们看来，由于观点上有分歧就更加迫切需要进行协商，以便解决这些分歧。我们应当很好地互相了解，并作出我们两国人民对普遍和平事业所应该作出的贡献。
    赫鲁晓夫说，1956年春天我们访问英国正就是为了达到这个目的。从那个时候到现在已经三年了。我们两国之间的关系曾处在微冻的状态。国际关系中总的寒冷气候在很多方面促成了这种情况。现在很多人都在谈论“解冻”，我们认为，英国首相的访问苏联也是这种“解冻”的结果。
  赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府过去和今后都主张各国领导人之间进行会晤和接触。苏联政府认为，这是解决分歧和缓和国际紧张局势的有效手段。
    赫鲁晓夫最后表示，希望英国首相的这次访问将有助于苏英两国友好关系的发展和加强，将是对创造更良好的国际环境以加强普遍和平的一个重要贡献。
    麦克米伦在讲话中说，自从他上次访问苏联以后，整个世界已经发生了巨大的变化。苏联已经变成世界上第二个工业强国。苏联在航空学、普通机器制造、建筑以及工业的组织方面的技术进步，得到了普遍的钦佩。
    麦克米伦说，英国非常愿意参加赫鲁晓夫常常强调的苏联同世界其他国家之间、特别是同美国之间在生产方面的竞赛。他说：“我们宁愿进行这种竞赛，而不进行别种竞赛。”
    他说：“我们在我们的生活方式方面，在我们的经济和我们的盟国方面，不怕同其他国家竞赛。我认为，在这些方面进行竞赛只会带来好处。”
    麦克米伦接着对赫鲁晓夫说：“我们能够共同做许多工作，我希望，我们可以把注意力放在那些使我们联合起来的问题上，而不是放在使我们分歧的问题上。”
