Fighting on the Eve of the Spring Festival
 本报记者(Our Correspondent)

	Regretting Preparing Too Few Materials
	The Spring Festival celebration has already begun, and enchanting music is constantly coming.

	While the day shift workers are reveling, the night shift workers of the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory are working hard in the workshop. Zhang Guangrong, the captain of the Mantanghong Youth Commando, walks around the youth workers' machine tools. From his smiling face, it can be seen that the commandos' production is excellent. The "High Yield Garden" set up before the Spring Festival has been filled with names. The secretary of the Communist Youth League branch said anxiously: So many people have overfulfilled their tasks on the 6th that there is no place to add their names.

	Youth commando member Kang Xiurong has overfulfilled his plan every day since February, creating the highest record of a shift working twenty-one hours in the workshop. Today, he arrived at the factory an hour early. After preparing everything, he began to process small gear shafts. He increased the depth of cut, and his hands kept putting in and taking out workpieces. Half an hour before the end of the shift, when he reached for the material with his left hand, he found nothing. What? The materials prepared for sixteen hours and forty-eight minutes of work were used up before the end of the shift!? The young man wiped the sweat from his forehead, regretting not preparing more materials. Now it was too late to regret it, so he had to walk to the side of young lathe operator Qu Yinjie and help him clean up his tools. Qu Yinjie did a really good job today, completing thirteen hours of work in one shift.

	"Let's clean up the materials and tools together, have dinner, and dance, okay? Let's have a good time for a few days, and then have another Mantanghong after the Spring Festival." With that, the two happily walked out of the workshop.

	Singing the Final Act Well
	On the eve of the Spring Festival, in the rolling mountains of the Jingsi Datel Mine, a festive atmosphere pervades everywhere. In the workers' club, old and new workers are gathering to hold a tea party, talking about the old and the new. Cooks are busy preparing sumptuous New Year's meals for the miners... At this time, the mine is a different scene, electric drills are roaring, coal seams are cracking, and workers are wielding picks, with coal dust mixed with coal blocks cascading down the "iron chute" onto rows of electric locomotives to be transported out... The workers want to bid farewell to the last working day before the Spring Festival with extraordinary achievements. The Sun Yuzhong team of the eighth mining section worked especially hard. This team created the mine's highest New Year's record of 20.7 tons per worker efficiency on the first day of production in 1959 and has maintained it ever since. Today, they are full of confidence to break this record, but unexpectedly, the Li Guoxiang team of the previous shift has already created a new record of 22.5 tons per worker efficiency, surpassing them. The Sun Yuzhong team was secretly surprised and looked at each other. Break it! They went down to the mine before the shift handover. Sun Yuzhong and two workers curled up in a narrow stope and swung their picks hard to mine coal. The workers of the loading and transportation team were so busy that they were out of breath, but they still mustered up the energy to challenge the coal miners: "Okay, we will transport as much as you mine." Neither side showed weakness, and everyone was covered in sweat. Sun Yuzhong looked at his watch from time to time. In this moment of competing for every second, the minutes seemed to be running like a horse. Six o'clock passed, and although more than a hundred carts of coal were produced, it was still far from the highest record. "Keep it up!" He encouraged his partners. The workers replied enthusiastically: "We must complete the task, or we won't feel good eating dumplings when we go back." In this way, they didn't stop for a moment... The hands of the clock pointed to ten o'clock. When the workers sent away the last train of coal carts, they all gathered in front of squad leader Sun Yuzhong and asked: "How much work did we do?" Sun Yuzhong excitedly replied: "One hundred and sixty-one carts, with a per worker efficiency of 39.35 tons." Everyone was overjoyed when they heard this. Everyone said: We fired the first shot on the first day of the Gregorian New Year, and sang a beautiful final act on the last day of the Lunar New Year. After the Spring Festival, we will have a "good start" too! That night, the workers didn't even rest and beat gongs and drums to report the good news to the Party committee.

	News That Can't Be Sent Out
	Zhang Enru picked up his pen and wrote excitedly on the manuscript paper: "From February 1st to 4th, the North China Radio Equipment Factory overfulfilled the plan for the first ten days of February by 25%, and the output value was much higher than the highest months of November and December last year..." After writing, he looked at it from beginning to end, feeling indescribably happy. This is a record that the factory has never had before!

	Just as he was about to send the manuscript to the newspaper, someone suddenly came in and said:
	"The output value on the 5th is even higher. Calculated, we have overfulfilled the plan for the first ten days by 66.7%..." He went on and on: "The workers are very motivated! For example, the mechanical workshop of the first branch factory launched a competition. In the past, a worker could only mill 1,700 supports a day at most. This time, a worker named Fu Biaoyun milled 2,100 a day, which is already amazing enough. Who knew that the next day, Sun Lichuan put in more effort and made 3,168, and the third day, Zhu Zhengqing made 3,288..." What to do? It would be a pity if such good material wasn't written in the manuscript! Zhang Enru had no choice but to start from scratch. After writing a few sentences, the dispatch room called again, saying that the plan was overfulfilled by 93% on the morning of the 6th... What to do? What to do? New news kept coming one after another, and the manuscript was simply impossible to write. Sure enough, after a while, the sound of gongs and drums shook the sky downstairs. He ran down and saw a large group of people carrying big red reports and boxes of new products. These new products were really lovely, the golden new-style microphones, the beautiful big and small loudspeakers, and the various instruments, a total of forty-five pieces! These were new products made by the first branch factory in more than a month. After hurriedly looking at them, he ran upstairs. Just as he sat down, the research institution came to report the good news to the Party committee! After a while, another branch factory came! It was too late to go and see them one by one, so he had to ask several comrades in the office to help collect materials.

	The machine will stop in a minute or two, and we will be on vacation soon, but good news is still coming! The workers are saying that they want to create new achievements in the last minute! What to do? Zhang Enru was worried, when will this news be sent out?

	Not Letting Go of a Second
	In the evening, at the construction site of the Beijing Thermal Power Plant, gongs and drums were sounding, and people were cheering. People were holding red flags and setting off firecrackers, congratulating the workers of this construction site for persisting in production until the last minute before the holiday, overfulfilling the original production plan by four times and creating the highest production record since New Year's Day this year.

	The last day before the holiday at the construction site of the Beijing Thermal Power Plant was different from usual. The enthusiastic labor competition launched by the workers made the entire construction site look new. On the erected scaffolding and newly built brick walls, posters and resolutions such as "Persist in production without letting go of a minute and a second" and "Complete the task and celebrate the Spring Festival happily" were posted everywhere. In the ash soil team, there were ten ash soil workers who originally planned to take an early bus to Liangxiang on the afternoon of the 7th to go home for the holiday. Later, they changed their minds. A few days ago, they wrote to their relatives at home, saying that they would persist in production at the construction site until the last second, to build this 100,000-kilowatt power plant in advance. Today, as soon as the sky was dawning, the workers of this team came to work early. They guaranteed to achieve both quality and speed on the last day before the holiday. In the ramming, they carefully picked out the rice straw and wood chips in the ash soil and rammed the ash soil flat and smooth. Until the last minute, they created a new record of ramming six cubic meters of soil per worker, doubling the efficiency.

	Today, the good news of workers completing their tasks ahead of schedule was frequently reported, and the deeds of the new record creators were broadcast on the radio from time to time. The seven bricklayer and carpenter teams on the north side of the factory building completed five projects such as bricklaying in the coal hopper and pouring concrete for the operating platform one hour ahead of schedule. While sending people to the Party branch of the Fourth Engineering Office to report the good news, they dispatched most of the workers to support the formwork dismantling workers in dismantling the formwork of the 100,000-kilowatt generator base. When they had not yet set off, they suddenly heard the news that the formwork dismantling workers were coming to support them. It turned out that the formwork dismantling workers had completed their production tasks half an hour earlier than them. As a result, they could only change their original plan and jointly support the ash soil workers in backfilling the foundation.

	Iron Water Flows, Singing the Spring Festival
	The lights in the general dispatch room of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company were brightly lit, and the telephone bell was ringing constantly. The two dispatchers were so busy that they were sweating profusely and couldn't answer all the calls. Wang Wenyuan, the chief of the production technology department who came to work the shift, helped to answer, but he still couldn't keep up. A dispatcher named Liang Zhansheng said that it had been so busy since he started working at four o'clock in the afternoon. Good news came one after another. One said that our No. 1 blast furnace produced dozens of tons more iron today, and the other said that the output of our No. 1 coke oven has increased again.

	The walls of the factory were plastered with many couplets: "Iron Water Flows, Singing the Spring Festival, Steel Flowers Bloom, Celebrating a Bumper Harvest", "Full House Red during the Spring Festival, Heroes and Heroines Rise the East Wind". There were also several good news reports written on large red paper downstairs in the office building. The workers were really motivated. Tomorrow is the Spring Festival, but no one is slacking off. After a day of work, they still went everywhere to pick up scrap iron and move sand.

	The No. 1 blast furnace was releasing iron water, and the fiery red iron water was flowing like a waterfall, making the furnace platform glow red. The twenty or so young men who were on duty for production during the Spring Festival were so busy that they were sweating profusely. Talking about spending the Spring Festival next to the furnace, foreman Song Yulin said: "I came to this furnace in 1938. The furnace is my home, and my home is the furnace. I am very happy to be able to spend the Spring Festival next to the furnace. As long as our labor can bring happiness to everyone, I am happy even if I am more tired." Li Xianzong, a twenty-five-year-old young worker, picked up a pen and wrote a poem on the spot to describe his feelings: "Firecrackers are ringing in the sky, songs and dances are filling the city, I am an ironworker, and I guarantee to the Party, the Spring Festival should be good, and production should be full of red."

	It was already past twelve o'clock when we left the blast furnace, and the factory was still a busy scene. When we arrived in the city, we heard melodious music from afar. The dance party probably hasn't ended yet, and people are having a good time. When we are having a good time, don't forget the workers who create happiness for people. Let us pay tribute to those workers with noble qualities!

    战斗在春节前夕
    本报记者
    后悔材料准备少了
    春节联欢会已经开始，迷人的音乐不断地传来。
    当白班工人正在狂欢的时候，北京第一机床厂的夜班工人却在车间紧张地劳动着。满堂红青年突击队队长张广荣在青年工人的机床旁走来走去，从他微笑的面孔上可以看出突击手们的生产是出色的。为春节前设置的“高产园地”已经写满了名字。团支部书记焦急地说：6日超额完成任务的人那么多，名字都没地方添了。
    青年突击队员康秀荣2月以来天天都超额完成计划，创造了车间一班干二十一个小时活的最高纪录。今天他提前一小时来到工厂，把一切准备工作做好以后，他就开始加工小齿轮轴。他加大了进刀量，双手不停的上活下活。离下班还有半小时了，当他左手去拿材料时却扑了个空，怎么？准备了十六小时四十八分钟工作量的材料，还没下班就干完了！？小伙子擦掉额头上的汗，后悔没有多准备材料，现在后悔也来不及了，只好走到青年车工曲茵杰旁边，帮他收拾工具，曲茵杰今天干的真不坏，一班完成了十三个小时的任务。
    “咱们俩把材料和工具收拾好，吃了饭，跳舞好吗？痛痛快快玩它几天，春节开工后再来一个满堂红”。说着，两人高高兴兴地走出了车间。压台戏唱得好春节前夜，山峦起伏的京西大台矿，到处是节日的气氛。在工人俱乐部里，新老工人正欢聚一堂，举行茶会，谈旧话新。炊事员们，忙着为矿工们准备丰盛的年餐……就在这时候，矿井下却是另一种景象，电钻在吼叫，煤层在崩裂，工人们挥动着镐头，煤末夹着煤块沿着“铁溜子”瀑布般地倾泻到一列列的电机车上往外运去……工人们要以不平凡的成绩，送别春节前的最后一个劳动日。回采一段八组的孙玉忠班格外干得欢，这一班人马在1959年开工生产的第一天就创造了每工效率20.7吨的全矿新年最高纪录，并一直保持了下来，他们今天正满怀信心要突破这个纪录时，不料前一班的李国祥班已经创造了每工效率22.5吨的新纪录，盖过了他们。孙玉忠班暗暗吃惊，面面相觑突破它！他们不到交接班就下到了矿井，孙玉忠和两个工人卷缩在一个狭小的搪孔里使劲挥动着镐头挖煤。装运组的工人们，忙得上气不接下气，但还鼓起劲儿和采煤工人挑战：“好，我们采多少你们得保证运多少。”两下都不示弱，个个累的满脸是汗。孙玉忠不时看手里的表，在这争分秒的时刻，分钟似乎像跑马一样。六点过去了，煤虽出了一百多车但比最高纪录还差很远，“加油呵！”他鼓励着伙伴们。工人们热烈地回答道：“非完成任务不可，完不好，回去吃饺子也不痛快。”就这样，他们没片刻的停歇……时针已经指向十点，当工人们送走了最后一列煤车时，都拥到班长孙玉忠跟前问：“干了多少活儿？”孙玉忠兴奋地回答说：“一百六十一车了，每工效率达到39.35吨。”大家听了，都喜出望外，大伙说：咱们过阳历年的头一天打响了第一炮，阴历年的最后一天唱了个漂亮的压台戏，过了春节，还要来个“开门红”呢！当晚，工人们连休息都没休息，就敲锣打鼓向党委报了喜。
    发不出去的消息
    张恩茹拿起笔兴奋地在稿纸上写着：“华北无线电器材厂2月1日到4日超额25％完成了2月前十天的计划，产值比去年最高月份11、12月还高很多……”。写完，他从头到尾看了一遍，心里真有说不出的痛快。这是厂里从来没有过的记录！
    正准备把稿子给报社寄出去，忽然进来个人说：
  “五号的产值更高了，算下来，我们超额66.7％完成了上旬计划……”。他滔滔不绝地说下去：“工人的干劲可足啦！像一分厂接插车间机械工段开展了竞赛，以前一个工人一天最多只能铣一千七百个支杆，这一次，有个名叫傅标运的工人一天铣了二千一百个，这已经够了不起了，哪知道第二天孙立川鼓了把劲作了三千一百六十八个，第三天朱正清又做了三千二百八十八个……”。怎么办？这么好的材料不写到稿子里太可惜！张恩茹只好动手重开头，写了几句，调度室又来电话了，说6日上午超额93％完成了计划……。怎么办？怎么办？新消息一个接一个传来，稿子简直没法写。可不是，过了一会，楼下锣鼓喧天，跑下去一看，见一大群人抬着红色的大喜报和一盒一盒的新产品走来。这些新产品真逗人喜欢，那金黄色的新式的话筒，那漂亮的大喇叭、小喇叭，还有那各式各样的仪表，一共四十五件！这是一分厂用一个多月功夫作出来的新产品。匆匆忙忙看完，跑上楼，刚坐下不一会，研究机构又来向党委报喜了！过了一会，另一个分厂又来了！自己一个一个去看是来不及了，只好请办公室几个同志帮忙搜集材料。
    过一、两分钟机器就要停了，马上就要放假了，可是好消息仍不断地传来！工人都说要在最后一分钟创出新成绩！怎么办？张恩茹发了愁，这条消息要到什么时候才能发出去呢？
    一秒钟也不放过
    傍晚，在北京热电厂工地上，锣鼓喧天，人声沸腾。人们拿着红旗，放着鞭炮，祝贺这个工地的职工坚持生产到假前最后一分钟，超额四倍完成了原定的生产计划，创造了今年元旦以来的最高生产纪录。
    节日前最后一天的北京热电厂工地，与往常不同。工人们开展的热火朝天的劳动竞赛，使全工地面貌焕然一新。在矗立起的脚手架上、新砌成的砖墙上，到处张贴着“坚持生产不放过一分秒”、“完成任务欢度春节”的标语纸和决心书。灰土班里，有十个灰土工，原计划在7日下午提前搭车到良乡回家过节的。后来又变了卦，前几天他们写信告诉家里的亲人，说自己要在工地上坚持生产到最后一秒钟，来提前建成这座发电能力十万瓩的厂房，今天清晨，天刚蒙蒙亮，这个班的工人就提前来上班了。他们保证在节日前的最后一天，做到质量和速度双跳龙门。在打夯中，他们细心地把灰土里的稻草和碎木，都拣了出来，把灰土打得平整光滑。到最后一分钟，他们创造了每工打夯土六立方公尺的新纪录，效率提高一倍。
    今天，工人们提前完成任务的捷报频传，广播器里不时地播送着新纪录创造者的事迹。厂房北面的七个瓦工、木工小组。提前一小时完成煤斗间砌墙、操作平台浇灌混凝土等五项工程任务后，一面派人到第四工程处党总支去报喜，一面抽出大部分工人去支援拆模工人拆除十万瓩机座的模板。当他们还未动身的时候，突然听到拆模工人来支援他们的消息，原来拆模工人比他们还提前半小时完成了生产任务。结果，他们只能改变原定计划，共同去支援灰土工回填基础。
    铁水奔流歌春节
    石景山钢铁公司总调度室的电灯点得通亮通亮，电话铃一个劲儿的响，两个调度员忙得满头大汗也接不过来，这个电话还没放下，那个电话又响了。来值班的生产技术处处长王文言帮着接，还是照顾不过来。一个叫梁占升的调度员说，从下午四点上班起，一直就这样忙，好消息一个接一个传来，这个说，我们一高炉今天多生产了几十吨铁，那个说，我们一焦炉的产量又提高了。
    工厂的墙上贴着好些对联：“铁水奔流歌春节，钢花怒放庆丰收”，“春节期间满堂红，英雄豪杰兴东风”办公楼下还有几张用大红纸写的喜报。工人们的干劲真足，明天就是春节了，但没一个松劲的。忙了一天，有会功夫，他们还到处去拣废铁，搬沙子。
    一高炉正在出铁水，火红的铁水像瀑布一样的流着，把炉台映得通红，轮到春节值班生产的二十多个年青的小伙子忙得一个个满头大汗。谈起在炉旁过春节，工长宋玉林说：“1938年我就到这个炉子上来了。炉子就是我的家，我的家就是炉子。我能在炉旁过春节心里很高兴，只要我们的劳动能给众人带来幸福，就是再累点也高兴。”二十五岁的青年工人李先宗拿起笔当场写了首诗叙述自己的感情：“爆竹连天响，歌舞闹全城，我是炼铁工，向党来保证，春节要过好，生产满堂红。”
    离开高炉，已经十二点多了，厂里还是一片繁忙景象。到城里了，远远传来了悠扬的音乐，舞会大概还没有结束，人们在尽情的玩。当我们痛痛快快的玩时不要忘记那些给人们创造幸福的工人，让我们向那些有高贵品质的工人致敬！
