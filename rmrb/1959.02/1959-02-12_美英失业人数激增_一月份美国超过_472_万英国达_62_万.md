Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Washington: According to official US figures released on the 10th, the number of unemployed in the United States in January of this year increased sharply by 616,000 compared to December 1958, reaching 4,724,000. This figure once again approaches the dangerous level of 5 million unemployed in the United States and is higher than the unemployment figures for January in any year since 1950.

    At the same time, the number of employed people in January decreased by 1,267,000.

    The resurgence in the number of unemployed also prompted US President Eisenhower to address the issue at a press conference on the 10th. He offered reassurance, saying that businesses would improve later this year.

    Xinhua News Agency, London, 10th dispatch: British Minister of Labour McLeod announced in the House of Commons today that the total number of unemployed people in Britain increased by 88,000 in January, reaching 620,000, the largest monthly increase in unemployment since the war.

    The total number of unemployed officially recorded in Britain in December last year was 531,700, accounting for 2.4% of the total labor force, while in January, it had increased to 2.8% of the total labor force.

    Economic experts point out that this is not the peak of unemployment, and unemployment will continue to increase. They also believe that the number of unemployed not included in the official statistics is as large as the officially announced figures.

    美英失业人数激增
    一月份美国超过472万英国达62万
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：据美国官方10日公布，今年1月份美国失业人数比1958年12月份猛增六十一万六千人，达到了四百七十二万四千人。这个数字又一次接近美国失业人数的危险点——五百万人，而且比1950年以来历年1月份的失业数字都要高。
    同时，1月份的就业人数减少了一百二十六万七千人。
    失业人数的再度猛增使得美国总统艾森豪威尔10日在记者招待会上也谈到了这个问题，他安慰人心说，今年晚些时候企业将会好转的。
    新华社伦敦10日电　英国劳工大臣麦克里奥德今天在下院宣布，英国失业总人数在1月份内增加了八万八千人，达到了六十二万人，这是战后失业人数增加得最多的一个月。
    去年12月份英国官方统计的失业总人数为五十三万一千七百人，占全部劳动力的2.4％，而1月份已增加到占全部劳动力2.8％。
    经济专家指出，这并不是失业人数的最高峰，失业还将继续增加。他们还认为官方统计没有计算在内的失业者的人数还有官方已公布的数字那么多。
