(Reported by our correspondent Wang Jianlin) In Gaotang County, Shandong Province, a medical and healthcare network centered on commune hospitals has been established throughout the county, enabling comprehensive medical prevention, hygiene and epidemic prevention, maternal and child healthcare, and the elimination of the four pests and promotion of hygiene to eliminate diseases. Currently, the county has eight commune hospitals (serving also as maternity hospitals), sixty-six health stations in factories and production management zones (approximately half of the management zones have two health stations), thirty-two maternity hospitals, and one thousand four hundred and sixty-eight production team health rooms. The commune hospitals and health stations have a total of 250 beds and are staffed with 466 doctors of traditional Chinese and Western medicine and other personnel. Each production team is generally equipped with health workers, sanitation workers, and midwives. Generally, minor illnesses are treated at the health stations, and major illnesses receive timely medical treatment at the commune hospitals. The masses find this convenient and praise it wholeheartedly.

This county's medical and healthcare network was established at the end of September 1958, shortly after the county's communization. Each commune hospital was based on the original township health clinic, and the medical and healthcare personnel of the entire commune were uniformly adjusted and assigned. After the establishment of the medical and healthcare network, it greatly facilitated the masses. Some seriously ill patients were admitted to their own hospitals nearby for the first time. The Chengguan Commune Hospital safely delivered eight women in just over a month; the Yinjji Commune Hospital mobilized the entire hospital and stayed up all night to save three critically ill patients with acute enteritis, finally curing them; the obstetrics doctor at Jiangdian Commune Hospital did everything possible to save a premature baby weighing only 1,500 grams; the Chengguan Commune Hospital enabled a nine-year-old child who had been paralyzed for several years to walk again.

In order to better serve the commune members and production, and to serve the patients, a thorough movement of breaking down the old and establishing the new was launched among the county's medical and health personnel. The old formalistic thinking of following rules and waiting for patients to come was criticized, and a set of rules and regulations and medical methods adapted to local characteristics and production needs were established: patients are treated as soon as they arrive, medicine is delivered to their hands, house calls are made upon request, family sickbeds are established, and designated areas are assigned for circuit medical services, etc. Last year, during the wheat planting season, the Yinjji Commune Hospital formed a "field hospital" to support production, providing medical care in the fields, with medical personnel following wherever production went, combining production and medical treatment. They also used their rest time to help the production team build twenty-four field toilets, trained thirty cooks for the field canteens, and improved the canteen hygiene. Now, a system of hanging nameplates for sick commune members has also been established in the health stations and health rooms. After returning from circuit medical services or house calls (the health stations have doctors but they are not always at home), the doctors look at the nameplates and go to the patients' homes to see them, delivering medicine and medical care to their doorsteps according to their names and addresses. Some production team health rooms also serve as temporary sickrooms or isolation rooms, with health workers performing regular nursing duties, serving tea, feeding food, and administering medicine to patients. This method saves labor, eliminating the need to assign dedicated caregivers, and commune members are satisfied knowing that they are cared for when they are sick.

The commune medical and healthcare network pays great attention to preventive work. Many commune medical and health personnel have established connections with nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, public canteens, and commune-run factories, strengthening the hygiene and epidemic prevention work of these collective units. Generally, a health check is conducted once a month for childcare workers, cooks, the elderly, and children. After examining 350 cooks in Yinjji Commune, thirteen who had chronic infectious diseases were reassigned. After seventeen children in the Yinjji Kindergarten contracted colds, isolation measures were taken, and Guan Zhong and licorice water were administered for prevention, quickly stopping the spread. Many communes have promptly treated diseases found in children during examinations, such as trachoma, roundworms, tinea capitis, and otitis media. Now, the vast majority of children have developed hygienic habits. The prevention and treatment of endemic diseases has also been carried out in conjunction with general surveys. According to seasonal changes and the prevalence of diseases, commune hospitals, stations, and rooms promptly organize various forces and adopt various methods to conduct health and epidemic prevention propaganda among the commune members. The epidemic reporting system is being strictly implemented. To protect women's health, many commune production teams have established menstrual registration books to appropriately arrange their farm work based on their menstrual periods and whether they are pregnant. At the same time, they are constantly educated on menstrual hygiene, late marriage, and contraception.

After the establishment of the commune medical and healthcare network, the patriotic health campaign was further developed under the promotion of medical and health personnel. The personnel of the health stations and rooms in each commune have become assistants and advisors in carrying out the patriotic health campaign. They adopt the method of assigning designated areas and focusing on key points to guide general improvements, continuously inspecting each village and providing technical guidance, and organizing villages to conduct evaluations and mobile red flag competitions, thus continuously increasing the number of model hygiene units. For example, in the Luli Temple Commune, out of a total of 120 natural villages, the number of villages with excellent hygiene work has reached 44, accounting for more than 33% of the entire commune.

After receiving free meals and basic social insurance, the broad masses of commune members have also received many conveniences in terms of disease treatment and prevention, and their health has been basically guaranteed. They used this folk song to express their feelings: "Pulling out the roots of poverty and planting the roots of wealth, pulling out the roots of disease and planting the roots of happiness; not worried about food and clothing and not afraid of disease, the Communist Party is everywhere for the people!"

    公社有医院　管理区有保健站　生产队有保健室
    高唐建成医疗保健网
    本报讯　记者王建林报道：公社有医院，管理区有保健站，生产队有保健室，山东省高唐县已经在全县范围内建成了以公社医院为中心的医疗保健网，使医疗预防、卫生防疫、妇幼保健、除四害讲卫生消灭疾病的工作全面开展起来。现在，这个县共有公社医院（兼产院）八处，工厂和生产管理区的保健站六十六处（约有二分之一的管理区设有两个保健站），产院三十二处，生产队保健室一千四百六十八处。公社医院和保健站共设病床二百五十张，配备中西医生和其他工作人员四百六十六人，各生产队普遍配齐了保健员、卫生员、接生员。一般作到小病不出保健站，大病在公社医院及时得到医疗。因此群众称便，同声叫好。
    这个县的医疗保健网是在1958年9月末，全县公社化不久建立的。各公社医院以原乡卫生所为基础，并对全公社的医疗保健人员统一进行了调整配备。医疗保健网建成后，大大地便利了群众。有些重病人第一次就近住上了自己的医院。城关公社医院仅在一个多月内就接受了八名产妇，安全分娩；尹集公社医院为了抢救三个急性肠炎的病危病人，全院总动员，一夜未睡，终于将病人治好；姜店公社医院产科医生想尽一切办法，救活了体重仅一千五百克的早产儿；城关公社医院使一个瘫痪数年的九岁的孩子又学会了走路。
    为了更好地面向社员、面向生产，为病人服务，在全县医疗卫生人员中曾深入开展了破旧立新运动。批判了按部就班，等客上门的旧的正规化思想，建立起一套适应当地特点和生产需要的规章制度和医疗办法：病人随到随诊，送药到手，应邀出诊，建立家庭病房，分片包干巡回医疗等等。去年种麦时，尹集公社医院为了支援生产，组成了“野战医院”进行田间医疗，生产到哪里，医务人员就跟到哪里，边生产、边医疗。他们并且利用休息时间，协助生产队搭起二十四个田间厕所，训练了三十个野战食堂的炊事人员，搞好了食堂卫生。现在，在保健站和保健室里还建立了社员有病挂牌的办法，巡回医疗或出诊归来（保健站有医生但不常在家）的医生，一看牌子，就按照姓名、住址到病人家中去看病，送医送药上门。有些生产队的保健室还兼作临时病号休养室或隔离室，保健员固定作护理工作，给病人端茶喂饭服药。这种办法节省劳力，不用再派专人侍候，社员感到病了有人照顾，因此都很满意。
    公社医疗保健网十分注意预防工作。很多公社的医疗卫生人员都同托儿所或幼儿园、敬老院、公共食堂以及社办工厂等方面建立联系，加强这些集体单位的卫生防疫工作。一般是一个月对保育、炊事员、老人和幼儿等进行一次健康检查。尹集公社三百五十名炊事员经检查后，对其中患有慢性传染病的十三名已进行了调整。尹集幼儿园有十七名幼儿患感冒后，除采取隔离措施外，服管仲、甘草水预防，迅速制止了流行。很多公社对在检查时发现的幼儿中的疾病如砂眼、蛔虫、头癣、中耳炎等都及时进行了治疗。现在，绝大多数孩子都养成了卫生习惯。对地方病也结合普查进行了防治。根据季节的变化和疾病的流行，各公社医院、站、室等都及时组织各种力量，采取各种办法，对社员群众进行卫生防疫宣传。疫情报告制度正在严格执行。为了保护妇女健康，很多公社的生产队都建立了妇女经期登记簿，以便根据她们的经期和是否怀孕，适当安排她们的农活。同时还不断地对她们进行经期卫生，晚婚以及避孕的宣传。
    公社医疗保健网建成后，在医疗卫生人员的推动下，爱国卫生运动更进一步地开展起来。各公社的保健站、室的人员成了开展爱国卫生运动的助手和参谋，他们采取分片包干和抓重点带一般的方法，不断对各村进行检查和技术指导，并组织各村开展评比和流动红旗竞赛，因而使卫生模范单位不断增多。如琉璃寺公社共一百二十个自然村，卫生工作优秀的村已达到四十四个，占全社的33％还多。
  广大社员群众在吃饭不要钱、得到了最基本的社会保险后，又在疾病治疗预防方面得到了很多方便，健康也基本上得到了保障。他们用这样一首歌谣说明自己的心情：“拔了穷根栽富根，拔了病根栽福根；吃穿不愁病不怕，共产党处处为人民！”
