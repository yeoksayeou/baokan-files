    Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from New York: American Communist Party Honorary Chairman William Z. Foster published a letter to the "New York Times" editorial department in the "Worker's Weekly" on the 15th, accusing the "New York Times" of distorting his letter to Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong in a Hong Kong dispatch, and demanding that the "New York Times" correct its distorted report.

    Foster pointed out that in his letter to Chairman Mao Zedong, he used the term "heroic struggle" in its generally accepted meaning in the workers' movement to refer to "peaceful coexistence must be won through heroic struggle," but the "New York Times" reporter replaced "heroic struggle" with the term "military means," thereby changing the meaning of the passage and making it sound as if it were calling for war rather than peace. The editors of the "New York Times" editorial department, in the same spirit of reversing black and white, also did their best to add a fabricated headline to the dispatch: "American Communist Party Discovers Contradiction"..."Foster Tells Mao that Coexistence Requires Military Combat."

    Foster pointed out that it cannot be said that the "New York Times"'s alteration of the text was due to translation difficulties. Because it is clear that the above passage, except for the word that was replaced, was copied verbatim from the English original. This immoral imposition was obviously thought of later by the "New York Times," and this deceptive substitution was deliberately adopted as part of a Cold War activity. Foster demanded that the "New York Times" retract the entire article and publish a correction.

### 福斯特斥“纽约时报”偷天换日  指责该报公然歪曲他给毛主席的信

    福斯特斥“纽约时报”偷天换日
    指责该报公然歪曲他给毛主席的信
    新华社16日讯　纽约消息：美国共产党名誉主席福斯特15日在“工人周报”上发表给“纽约时报”编辑部的一封信，指责“纽约时报”在一篇香港通讯中歪曲报道他写给中国共产党主席毛泽东的一封信，并且要求“纽约时报”更正它的歪曲报道。
    福斯特指出，他在给毛泽东主席的信中以“英勇斗争”这个措词在工人运动中公认的意义谈到“和平共处必须用英勇的斗争来争取”，但是“纽约时报”记者却用“军事手段”这种措词代替了“英勇斗争”，从而改变了这段话的意义，使它读起来好像是在要求战争而不是要求和平。“纽约时报”编辑部的编辑本着同样颠倒黑白的精神也克尽厥职、为这条电讯加了一个捏造的标题：“美国共产党发现了矛盾”………“福斯特告诉毛泽东，共处需要军事战斗”。
    福斯特指出，不能说，“纽约时报”对本文的这种改变是由于翻译上的困难。因为很明显，上述这一段除了被换掉的那个字眼以外是一字不错地从英文原文抄下来的。这种不道德的硬加显然是“纽约时报”后来才想起来的，这种偷天换日的作法是作为冷战活动的一部分故意采取的。福斯特要求“纽约时报”撤销全文，登载更正。
