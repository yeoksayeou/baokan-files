Column: Discussion on Poetry Issues

    Comrade Guo Moruo Answers Questions from Poetry Magazine

    I. Is the new folk song the mainstream of the current poetry movement?

    The new folk songs mentioned here, I think, mainly refer to the ballads that have emerged since the Great Leap Forward. The general discussion of this issue tends to focus on form. Currently, the form of new folk songs is relatively close to the old forms, mostly in seven-character lines, especially the folk songs in rural areas. The folk songs from factories are slightly different.

    I think it is best not to understand it from the perspective of form. The people's cultural level is constantly improving. Many people's communes and factories are running middle schools and universities. The workers and peasants will receive higher education, and the intellectuals will also undergo labor training. The line between mental and physical labor will gradually disappear. As a result, the form of poetry may also change. Therefore, it is best not to talk about the issue from a fixed form. In fact, the form of Chinese poetry has been changing for thousands of years, from four-character lines to five-character lines, to seven-character lines, to lines of varying lengths. In the old days, the productive forces were not liberated, so any change seemed slow. Especially China's feudal society stagnated for more than two thousand years, and the development of production and the improvement of culture were particularly slow. Today's situation is completely different. One day is equal to twenty years, so it is difficult for us to determine what today's folk song form is and what tomorrow's form will be. Content determines form. The cultural level of workers and peasants has improved, and their lifestyles will inevitably change. Won't the form of poetry change? In my opinion, the spirit of today's new folk songs is the mainstream. New folk songs all originate from production and labor practice. They express the revolutionary optimism and communist style of the working people. This spirit and attitude should be said to be the core of new folk songs. It is not only the mainstream today, but also the mainstream in the future. As for why it takes today's form, it is related to the habits of farmers over many years. Today, farmers have not changed their habits in terms of housing, clothing, etc., and the literary forms they express have not changed much, but we cannot conclude that they will not change in the future. On the contrary, according to the history of poetry development over the past thousands of years, and according to the current social leap forward, it can be concluded that the form of poetry will change in the future.

    Let me mention something from the past. A few years ago, most friends in the literary and art circles despised old poetry and old forms. In recent years, Chairman Mao's poems have been published, and everyone's understanding has changed. I remember that I made a suggestion during the planning stage of "Poetry Magazine," suggesting that you should not be biased and should treat old forms equally. In the past, all old things like folk songs and ballads were rejected, believing that they could not be on the "stage of elegance." I used to be scolded for writing old poetry, and sometimes I didn't dare to publish old poems. When compiling collections, I would pick out old poems and make them "outside the collection." We are too westernized and look down on local things. This is a trend that has formed since the May Fourth Movement and can be said to be influenced by the comprador class ideology. In recent years, we have turned back to affirm the value of old poetry and folk songs, which is a good phenomenon. In old poetry and folk songs, there are indeed many things worth learning for new poets. With the improvement of people's culture, after these two things are integrated, I think a new form will appear.

    Chairman Mao said in his letter to Comrade Kejia: "Poetry should of course be based on new poetry, and some old poetry can be written, but it is not suitable to be promoted among young people, because this style restricts thinking and is not easy to learn." I think this is very fair. Of course, there are all kinds of new poetry. Since the May Fourth Movement, there have been tofu-like forms, ladder-like forms, one-word-per-line forms, fourteen-line forms..., some so-called new poems have broken away from the laws of Chinese old poetry, but have been shackled by Western old poetry. Therefore, Chairman Mao's saying "new poetry should be the mainstay" probably needs some explanation. The "new poetry" that the Chairman is talking about is probably free verse that has broken away from the strict rules of old poetry, or pure poetry of nature. In my opinion, compared with old poetry, free verse is relatively free. Old poetry, especially regulated verse and ci, is very strict in terms of rhyme and tone; folk songs and ballads, although close to old forms, are also relatively free in terms of rhyme. Many new poets learn to write old poetry, which makes people feel a bit out of tune. The old poetry that the Chairman is talking about refers to things with relatively strict rules, which are really not easy to handle. Like me, who started doing it at the age of five or six, and is now sixty-seven years old, I still have to be out of tune sometimes. The main point of the Chairman's proposal is to focus on the fact that poetry can be relatively free. However, whether it is new poetry or old poetry, the spirit must be of today, revolutionary, and this is the mainstream. Speaking of old poetry, there are all kinds of old poetry, and some people's old poetry is not suitable to be on our stage of elegance. The form of folk songs will change in the future, and we advocate diversification. As for the free verse since the May Fourth Movement, as long as it is not a very awkward twenty-odd characters per sentence, as long as it is not American or British style, but Chinese style, I think it can continue. Comrade Chen Yi sometimes writes very strict old-style poems, and sometimes he writes free verse. The "Visiting 'Ants Gnawing Bones'" published in the newspaper yesterday (see People's Daily, December 8, 1958 - Editor's note) is free verse. Isn't this encouraging for poets since the May Fourth Movement! In short, don't take the form issue too seriously. The main thing is the spirit and content, and use the most appropriate form to match it. As long as free verse can express today's spirit, it will still be affirmed with a fair eye. Therefore, instead of saying that new folk songs are the mainstream of the poetry movement, it is better to say that the spirit of new folk songs is the mainstream of the poetry movement, because whether it is the mainstream does not depend on the form.

    Now that new poets have corrected the bias of despising old poetry and folk songs in the past, the form of new poetry may change and the form of folk songs may also change through a period of dialectical unity during the correction process. Taking the seven-character form as an example, it formally appeared in Cao Pi's poems, but it really became popular in the Tang Dynasty. It has been more than a thousand years now, that is to say, the seven-character form has dominated poetry for more than a thousand years. We hope for a better form to emerge.

    In today's new folk songs, although some different tunes can already be seen, it is not purely seven-character. But if you think that the prevalence of seven-character new folk songs is a temporary phenomenon, that is also inappropriate. Its form is not temporary, but has dominated for more than a thousand years, and may very well have a lifespan of not a thousand years, or even ten thousand years. For example, the four-character poems of the "Book of Songs" era have been around for three thousand years, but as long as you are talented, you can still use them today. Therefore, we must never despise the form of new folk songs, but must attach special importance to new folk songs, learn from them in spirit and also learn from them in form. The spirit is constantly developing and constantly revolutionary, and the form is also constantly developing and constantly revolutionary.

    II. Do new folk songs have limitations?

    This question should be affirmed. In my opinion, new folk songs have some limitations. In fact, everything has its limitations.

    Due to changes in the times and life, our vocabulary is also changing, and longer words are increasing. Such as "Proletarian Dictatorship", "People's Republic of China", "Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference", "Democratic People's Republic of Korea", etc., from six characters to eleven characters, are all one word. In ancient times, it was generally one character per word, or two or three characters per word, so the four-character, five-character, and seven-character lines of that era were relatively easy to adapt to. Later, it was different. If a word exceeds five characters, four-character poems cannot solve it. A rightist once made a joke. When he was filling in words, he wanted to use the word "Suez Canal", but he was limited by the number of characters allowed in that place and only allowed four characters, so he cut off the word "Su", becoming "Ishi Canal". Just like Mr. Su Dongpo can be called Mr. Dongpo, it seems that the Suez Canal also has the surname Su. This method is too clumsy. Even if you want to cut it, cutting the word "canal" is better than cutting the word "Su". We affirm that new folk songs have their limitations, but a truly capable person can use them very flexibly within the limitations.

    Today's new folk songs, especially those from rural areas, are generally closer to the old forms. In fact, it should be said the other way around: old forms originated from folk songs. For example, seven-character poems, as I said just now, formally appeared in Cao Pi's poems, but they were not created by Cao Pi or any other poet. They first appeared in folk songs. For example, some folk songs and proverbs in the "Book of the Later Han" have many seven-character lines, and the inscriptions on the back of bronze mirrors made in the Xin Mang and Eastern Han dynasties also have many seven-character lines. There are even many "seven-character mirrors" that start by saying "The record of seven-character lines begins with mirrors." These are all works by anonymous writers, or works by Han Dynasty workers. Therefore, seven-character poems come from the folk. The reason for this is also the result of the development of life. As life developed and language developed, the limitations of the original four or five characters per sentence increased, so in the Han Dynasty, they began to create seven-character sentences. Generally speaking, folk things always run ahead of literati. Professional literati did not use the seven-character form to write "Swallow Song" until Cao Pi in the Three Kingdoms period, and there were only two such poems. The poems of the Cao family and sons, the Seven Scholars of Jian'an, etc., were basically five-character lines, and even four-character lines. It was not until the Tang Dynasty that the seven-character form became the mainstream. Folk things ran ahead for a long time. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say that old forms originated from folk songs than to say that folk songs are close to old forms.

    Today's new folk songs are developing, and the people may create some new forms. When that time comes, we will have to learn again. Now, the poems of workers and the poems of peasants are very different, because the things they come into contact with and their lifestyles are somewhat different, so the tunes of their works are also different. In the future, when rural areas are industrialized, the differences between urban and rural areas are eliminated, the differences between workers and peasants are eliminated, especially after the differences between our intellectuals and workers and peasants are eliminated, there will be a big change, and a more free form will emerge. The development of poetry itself is also like this. When the seven-character form became a fixed form, folk things were still breaking its limitations, and that is using lines of varying lengths. For example, the lyrics of old operas love to use the "three-three-four" tune. "I was originally a reclusive person in Wolonggang," this is the "three-three-four" tune. After the seven-character form was fixed, the folk and literati were still trying to break through it, which shows that it still has limitations. It is not in accordance with the facts to say that new folk songs have no limitations.

    It sounds like a contradiction, but I think the advantage of new folk songs lies in their limitations. The author can express them appropriately within the limitations, and that is where the wonder lies. This is "both discipline and freedom." Originally, freedom is freedom within rules. If it is an undisciplined, unbridled horse-like thing, then it is not freedom but indulgence. In fact, even indulgent poems still have their rhythm. You can't just take a piece of prose, divide it into lines, and call it poetry. People won't agree with that. As poetry, it always has the nature of poetry in it.

    III. On what basis does Chinese new poetry develop?

    As I said before, when it comes to this kind of question, everyone's debate focuses on form, and in my opinion, we shouldn't focus on form. I said a long time ago: the form doesn't matter whether it's new or old, the main thing is the content. If we put new content into an old form, we cannot deny that it is something new; conversely, can we say that something like Xu Zhimo's work is new? Therefore, the foundation for the development of new poetry should not be pursued from the form, but should be elaborated from labor practice and from the integration of intellectuals and the worker-peasant masses. Content always occupies a leading position, and politics comes first. This is definitely unswerving. With certain content, a certain form will be produced. In the past, we who did new poetry were monopolistic, looked down on old forms, and often excluded old things when editing magazines, ignored them, and even hated old things, turning "contradictions among the people" into "antagonistic contradictions." Today, some friends still have prejudices and are still arguing endlessly over the new and old forms. We should not be biased in this direction, we should focus on politics first, labor first, and life first. Under this premise, any form is acceptable. Of course, the form produced in this situation is likely to be a further combination of free verse and old poetry. Or parallel development. We must know that the good new poems since the May Fourth Movement have not completely broken away from the influence of old poetry. You are using Chinese to write poetry, and you cannot violate the laws or rhythms of the Chinese language itself.

    IV. How should we evaluate the new poetry since the May Fourth Movement?

    The new poetry since the May Fourth Movement has still made contributions, and its achievements should be affirmed. For example, anti-feudalism, the liberation of individuality, the breaking of restraints, and the breaking through the strict rules of old poetry should be affirmed. Although the foreign influence is great, poets cannot be classified in the same way. Old poetry and folk songs, after thousands of years of selection, polishing, and circulation, have their good things, and they will still have life in the future. Although poetry since the May Fourth Movement has been influenced by foreign countries, it is still poetry written by Chinese people in Chinese, and must abide by certain rules, and move within these rules. Some poems have their value, and we cannot completely deny the things since the May Fourth Movement. I hope someone can select the valuable things since the May Fourth Movement.

    The form of new poetry since the May Fourth Movement, infused with today's content, can continue to develop, and the form of new folk songs will also continue to develop. These two forms may come to a unity in the future, or they may each have their own merits. It is difficult for new poetry to monopolize, and if it does not change frequently, it will not be new. It is also difficult for us to say that new folk songs will not change in the next ten thousand years.

    I personally have this experience (and it may not be just me), that in public occasions, reciting poetry, the styles of old poetry and folk songs are not very suitable. It is both difficult to recite and monotonous, and it is not easy for the listeners to understand. If it is sung or accompanied by bamboo clappers, then it is right. Just reciting is not as good as the free verse since the May Fourth Movement. This time when I went to Korea, at an evening party held at the headquarters of the Volunteer Army, everyone wanted me to recite the long poem I wrote on National Day. While I recited it, I also had to explain it, which took nearly an hour. I was exhausted and the listeners were also exhausted. Through singing or accompanying with bamboo clappers, it becomes something with a musicality, while in public occasions, relying entirely on the power of the poem itself to move people, and also making everyone understand, I am afraid that free verse is more suitable. This is my experience. If we are not willing to affirm this point, it would be too biased. Of course, the new poets since the May Fourth Movement should learn new folk songs well, and at the same time polish up old poetry, so that their poems are more in line with Chinese habits and more suitable for the nature of the Chinese language.

    We should analyze the phrase "new poetry since the May Fourth Movement." There are all kinds of new poetry since the May Fourth Movement, what New Moon School, Symbolist School, this school and that school, I don't really understand. I don't know what school Li Jinfa's poems belong to, they are really incomprehensible, just like Hu Feng's articles.

    There is no doubt that we should affirm the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, to pursue democracy and science. In politics, it showed anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, and in culture, it showed the breaking of old forms, overthrowing the Confucian shop, and sending the saints and all idols into the latrine. This spirit still had its significance in that era. But there are various schools in new poetry, and the achievements of each poet are inconsistent. We should make a general and fair evaluation of the valuable things in these nearly forty years since the May Fourth Movement. Some new poems since the May Fourth Movement, such as Hu Shi's "Collection of Experiments," have not broken away from the old tune at all, like a notice, I don't know what it is. But we cannot therefore completely dismiss new poetry. For example, as I mentioned just now, free verse is still necessary when reciting. Old poetry had its recitation tune in ancient times, and this tune is very long. Now, everyone will laugh when reciting it, because today's living habits are different from those in ancient times. I have not recited poetry in rural areas, but I estimate that if I go to rural areas to recite poetry, free verse is probably easier to understand, because it is close to spoken language. As for folk songs and old poetry, the former is still not that difficult, while the latter is not only incomprehensible to farmers, but also may not be understood by our intellectuals. For example, Kejia's interpretation of Chairman Mao's "Two Poems of Sending Away the God of Plague" has some points that I think are worth discussing. Therefore, we still have to go back to the Chairman's words, old poetry is good, especially if it skillfully expresses new content, making people deeply feel that there is both discipline and freedom, but it is difficult to learn, and not easy to understand, so "it is not suitable to be promoted among young people." The Chairman's instruction is very valuable. Of course, anyone can write it, not limited to us old men. Young people are leaping forward quickly, and at the same time they have no prejudices. If they really study it seriously, they can still learn it. The most difficult thing is the poets who grew up after the May Fourth Movement, because they already have their own set, and it is difficult to get into it.

    Because old poetry is not easy to understand, therefore every person has their own interpretation. Poetry itself is very difficult to explain, especially the poetry of the Symbolist School, which is the most difficult to explain. Chairman Mao's poems are certainly not Symbolist, but there are symbolic things in Chairman Mao's poems, and each word may have its own world behind it, so there can be various different interpretations. When we interpret it, we should seek to be closest to the original intention of the author, so that we can feel more at ease. Here, I might as well say a few words about the Chairman's two "Sending Away the God of Plague."

    In my opinion, these two poems represent two eras, and "The same sorrows and joys chase the passing waves" is a key, which draws a line between the two eras. "Passing waves" is time, and all kinds of sorrows and joys in the world helplessly pass away with time. Grasping this sentence, you will know that it is the dividing line: the first poem writes about the old era, and the second poem writes about the new era. "The same sorrows and joys chase the passing waves" is a negative criticism of the old society. In the era before liberation, some people lived in drunken stupor, taking things as they came, which is the representative of joy; more people were suffering from poverty, which is the representative of sorrow. Whether you live in drunken stupor or suffer from poverty, they all pass away with the passage of time. Grasping this key, you can know that the first poem basically writes about the old era before liberation, and the second poem writes about the new era after liberation. However, in the newspapers, I saw many different interpretations. For example, some people think that the fifth and sixth lines of the first poem are very positive, and only people with the Chairman's status can experience them, so they divide the first poem into two paragraphs, the first paragraph is sorrow, and the second paragraph is joy. This interpretation cannot be in sync with the last sentence. This interpretation just shows that he is a layman to Chinese old poetry.

    The first two lines of the first poem are easy to explain. In the South, many places have schistosomiasis, which even famous doctors like Hua Tuo could not cure. The history of schistosomiasis is very long, and some people say that it was introduced from Japan, but it may not be certain.

    The third and fourth lines - "Thousands of villages leave feces of withered plants, ten thousand households are desolate with ghosts singing." The Chairman used a story about Lian Po here. During the Warring States period, the King of Zhao intended to use the retired veteran Lian Po to resist the Qin soldiers, and sent messengers to visit Lian Po. The State of Qin was afraid that Lian Po would come out again, so they bought off Guo Kai of the State of Zhao. Guo Kai instructed the messenger who went to visit Lian Po to make a false report to the King of Zhao, saying that the old general had a meal with him, and during the meal he defecated three times. This is the so-called "defecating three times in one meal." The King of Zhao was deceived and did not use Lian Po. The source of "leaving feces" in the Chairman's poem is here, which means that people are useless. Under the harm of schistosomiasis, the patient has a big belly, can eat but cannot work, the labor force is gone, and the crops are therefore abandoned; and many people die, sometimes the whole village dies. These two lines describe the old people's inability to live, so it is the sorrowful side.

    But there were also people in the old days who enjoyed happiness. They sat on the ground without moving and traveled 80,000 li in a day. Why? Because the circumference of the earth is 80,000 Chinese li, and the earth rotates once. People who sit on the ground without moving are counted as having taken a trip. In the past, King Mu of Zhou only "traveled 30,000 li a day with eight steeds," but people who don't work run 80,000 li a day sitting down. Isn't this more impressive than King Mu of Zhou? "Patrolling the sky" refers to the Earth's revolution. It travels more than five million Chinese li a day. In space, you can see countless nebulae. According to recent research, there are more than 10,000. The nature is similar to the Milky Way. "A thousand rivers" refers to these nebulae. "A thousand" only refers to its abundance, not a fixed number. But it seems that it can also be changed to "ten thousand." In the past, Emperor Ming of Tang and Ye Fashen traveling to the Moon Palace was a very happy story. In the old days, there were people who stayed up all night greedy for pleasure. The earth took them around to revolve, and at night they could see countless galaxies from afar. Isn't this more impressive than Emperor Ming of Tang? In this way, these fifth and sixth lines can be interpreted as the joyful side, and also contain the concept of "passing waves." In the old era, there was such an opposition between sorrow and joy, and the people were helpless. Therefore, "the Cowherd wants to ask about the God of Plague," and the answer he gets can only be "the same sorrows and joys chase the passing waves!" The old era is the same for thousands of years, but such an era is gone forever. This meaning will be expressed in the second poem.

    The second poem is about the new era. "Spring breeze, willows, tens of thousands of branches, 600 million Shenzhou are all Shun and Yao." The whole country is liberated, everything is different, everyone is the emperor, and everyone is the good emperor in the Chinese people's ideals, and the saint respected by the Chinese people. "Red rain follows the heart and turns into waves, green mountains intentionally transform into bridges." A "follows the heart" and an "intentionally," these two words are used too well. This uses personification. The Chairman is good at using personification, which is to write inanimate objects as people. Red rain is falling flowers. Falling flowers turn into waves in the sky, not turning with people's intentions, but turning with their own intentions. This shows that falling flowers also have life, and they are also in the Great Leap Forward. "Green mountains intentionally transform into bridges," the previous green mountains hindered transportation, and there were also things like miasma; today's green mountains regulate the climate, prevent floods and droughts, provide building timber, and offer various metals, and it is "intentionally" transformed into bridges. It is not only no longer an obstacle, but also helps the people and contributes to the national economy. In this way, even the mountains and plants are alive in today's Great Leap Forward. The green mountains desperately play an economic role, and the falling flowers also feel extremely happy and free, turning into waves and boosting the scenery. Mountains, rivers, vegetation are all leaping forward, and the people naturally go without saying. General poets like to use "unintentionally" and "intentionally." Here you can see the Chairman's grammar, it is not only "unintentional", but also "follows the heart"; it is not only "intentional", but also "intentionally", which is particularly vivid and powerful.

    The third and fourth lines come from "spring breeze, willows, tens of thousands of branches." The Chairman used the description of nature to set off our great era. The fifth and sixth lines are inherited from "600 million Shenzhou are all Shun and Yao." "The sky connects the five ridges, the silver hoe falls" is writing about the Great Leap Forward in rural areas. The farmers hold up silver hoes and are deeply tilling the land and splitting mountains to open canals. Although the "Five Ridges" are in the South, here you can infer three from one corner, saying one South, and the North is the same. "The earth moves three rivers, the iron arms shake." "Three rivers" generally refers to the North, but in the same way, it can also be inferred from one corner to include the South. "Iron arms" can be interpreted as the arms of the working people. If compared with the "silver hoes" in the previous sentence, it can also be interpreted as cranes, drilling machines, or pneumatic drills, etc., so this sentence is writing about the industrial Great Leap Forward. "Iron arms" shake the "three rivers," what a great momentum! With just these two sentences, it summarizes the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, and expresses the demeanor of Tang Yao and Yu Shun today. In addition, the description of natural scenery in the third and fourth lines fully visualizes the current Great Leap Forward. So, in this situation of "paper boats and bright candles burning in the sky," where will the God of Plague go? There is only one way to die! Here, the Chairman used romanticism, using the customs of the previous Ullambana Festival to express the elimination of schistosomiasis. Of course, schistosomiasis cannot be sent away by burning paper boats, but by scientific methods. But today it is still burning, that is, burning the snails that transmit schistosomiasis. Snails are the intermediate station of schistosomiasis. The eggs of schistosomiasis must hatch in the snail's body before they can make trouble, so to eliminate schistosomiasis, snails must be eliminated. Indeed, wherever there is schistosomiasis, it is burning everywhere, and the fire is soaring into the sky.

    The above is just an explanation from the surface of the poem. The Chairman organized two "Sending Away the God of Plague" to eliminate schistosomiasis, but we can also expand it a little, and symbolically say that all reactionaries are schistosomiasis, imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek, rightists, etc. are all gods of plague, and under the leadership of the Party, the Chinese people have sent them all away. This is my interpretation, which is a bit different from the interpretation of Comrade Kejia and other comrades. Of course, my interpretation is not necessarily correct either. I believe that after you publish it, someone will disagree. But it is good to have a debate, let a hundred flowers bloom!

    Now let's get back to the point, old poetry has such difficulties. The Chairman's two sixteen-line poems, with their majestic spirit, are a good combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism; but they are really not easy to understand, and I myself dare not say that I fully understand them. Therefore, the Chairman said: "This style restricts thinking." In short, there are good things in old poetry, but it does not mean that all old poetry is good, that would be generalizing; conversely, there are bad things in new poetry, but it cannot be said that all new poetry is not good, that would also be generalizing. We must look at the problem fairly and analytically, look at the problem from development, look at the problem from content, and look at the problem from the combination of content and form. In this way, we can get a more nearly correct view.

    To repeat, we must affirm the spirit of the new poetry since the May Fourth Movement, and we should treat the works of each poet selectively, and not dismiss everything. The new poetry since the May Fourth Movement still has its life, and the path of free verse is still a path that can be taken. This is my personal opinion.

### 当前诗歌中的主要问题

1959-02-13

专栏：关于诗歌问题的讨论

    当前诗歌中的主要问题 
    郭沫若同志答诗刊社问一、新民歌是否当前诗歌运动的主流？
    这里说的新民歌，我想主要是指大跃进以来所出现的歌谣。对于这个问题，一般的讨论偏重于形式方面。目前新民歌的形式，比较接近于旧形式，基本上以七言的为多，特别是农村中的民歌。由工厂来的民歌又稍为不同一点。
    我觉得我们最好还是不要从形式上来了解。人民文化水平在不断提高，许多人民公社、工厂都在办中学、大学，工农群众要受高等教育，再加知识分子也经过劳动锻炼，脑力劳动和体力劳动的界线将逐步消除。这样一来，诗歌的形式也可能会发生变化。所以最好不要偏重在固定的形式上谈问题。事实上，中国几千年来的诗歌形式都在变，由四言到五言，到七言，到长短句。旧时代的生产力没有解放，所以任何变化都显得迂缓。特别是中国的封建社会停滞了两千多年，生产的发展和文化的提高都特别慢。今天的情况已完全不同，一天等于二十年，所以今天的民歌形式是这样，明天的形式又是怎样，我们很难断定。内容决定形式，工农文化水平提高了，生活习惯必然会有所改变，难道诗歌的形式就不会改变？我认为，今天新民歌的精神是主流。新民歌都是从生产和劳动实践出发的，它表现了劳动人民的革命乐观主义和共产主义风格，这种精神和气概，应该说是新民歌的核心。它不仅是今天的主流，同时也是今后的主流。至于所以采取了今天这样的形式，则和农民多少年来的习惯有关。今天农民在住家、穿衣等方面的习惯都没有改，他们表现出来的文艺形式也没有多大的改变，但不能因此断定将来就不改。相反的，根据以往几千年来诗歌发展的历史，根据当前社会跃进的情况，可以断定今后诗歌的形式会改变。
    这里顺便提一点往事。前几年一般文艺界的朋友，就是藐视旧诗词和旧形式，近年来毛主席的诗词发表了，大家的认识才不同了。记得我在“诗刊”酝酿期中就提过意见，建议你们不要偏，对旧的形式要一律看待。过去凡是民歌民谣等旧的东西一概被排斥，认为不能登大雅之堂。我过去闹闹旧诗是挨过骂的，有时候不敢发表旧诗，在编集子时把旧诗都剔出来成为“集外”。我们的洋气太盛，看不起土东西，这是五四以来形成的一种风气，可以说是受了买办阶级思想的影响。近年来我们回过头来肯定了旧诗词的价值，肯定了民歌民谣的价值，这是好现象。在旧诗词和民歌民谣中，确实有不少东西值得新诗人学习。随着人民文化的提高，这两种东西打成一片后，我看，是会有新的形式出现的。
    毛主席在给克家同志的信上这样说：“诗当然应以新诗为主体，旧诗可以写一些，但是不宜在青年中提倡，因为这种体裁束缚思想，又不易学”。我认为这样说是很公平的。当然，新诗也有各种各样的新诗，五四以来的新诗，有豆腐干的形式，有梯子坎的形式，有一字一行的形式，有十四行的形式……，有些所谓新诗虽然摆脱了中国旧诗的规律，而却套上了西洋旧诗的枷锁。所以主席说的“以新诗为主体”这句话，恐怕要作一番解释。主席所说的“新诗”大概是摆脱了旧诗词的谨严格律的自由诗，或者说纯任天籁的诗。按我的想法，和旧诗对照起来说，自由诗是比较自由一些。旧诗，特别是律诗和词，在音韵平仄上是非常严格的；民歌民谣，虽然接近旧形式，但音韵方面也比较自由。好些新诗人学写旧诗词，使人感到有点不入调。主席说的旧诗词，就是指格律比较严的东西，那种东西实在不大好搞，像我这样是从五六岁搞起的，搞到现在六十七岁了，有的时候还要脱韵。主席这样提，主要还是着重在诗律可以比较自由一点。不过无论新诗或旧诗，精神必须是今天的，是革命的，这个东西是主流。就说旧诗也有各种各样的旧诗，有些人的旧诗，那是不敢来登我们的大雅之堂的。民歌的形式将来会变，我们主张多样化。五四以来的自由诗，只要不是很别扭的二十几个字一句，只要不是美国式或英国式的，而是中国式的，我看还是可以继续下去。陈毅同志有时写很严格的旧体诗，有时也写自由诗。昨天报上发表的“参观‘蚂蚁啃骨头’”（见1958年12月8日人民日报——编者）就是自由诗。这对五四以来的诗人岂不是可以长长志气！总之，不要把形式问题看得太重，主要是精神和内容，要以最合适的形式来配合它。自由诗只要能表达今天的精神，还是会被公平的眼光肯定的。所以与其说新民歌是诗歌运动的主流，不如说新民歌的精神是诗歌运动的主流，因为是否主流不决定于形式。
    现在新诗人把过去轻视旧诗词和民间歌谣的偏向纠正了，在纠正过程中，经过一段辩证的统一，可能新诗的形式会变更，民歌民谣的形式也会变更。拿七言体来说，正式出现于曹丕的诗中，但它真正流行起来还是唐朝，到现在已经一千多年，也就是说七言体统治了诗歌一千多年。我们希望有一种更好的形式出来。
    在今天的新民歌中，虽然已经可以看出有些不同的调子，不纯粹是七言。但如果认为七言的新民歌较多是一时的现象，那也是不恰当的。它的形式不是一时的，而是已经统治了一千多年了，今后很可能不是一千年，甚至还有一万年的生命。比如“诗经”时代的四言诗，到现在已经有三千年了，但只要你高明的话，你今天还是可以运用。所以我们决不能藐视新民歌的形式，而要特别重视新民歌，从精神上学习它，也要从形式上学习它。精神是不断发展、不断革命的，形式也是不断发展、不断革命的。
                二、新民歌有无局限性？
    这个问题应该肯定一下，我的看法新民歌是有些局限性的。事实上，任何东西都有它的局限性。
    由于时代和生活的改变，我们的词汇也在改变，长的词汇多起来了。如“无产阶级专政”、“中华人民共和国”、“中国人民政治协商会议”、“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国”等，从六个字写到十一个字，都是一个词。古时候大体上是一个字一个词，多则两三个字一个词，所以那个时代四言、五言、七言是比较容易适应的。到后来就不同了，假如一个词超过五个字，四言诗就不能解决。有个右派分子闹过一个笑话，他在填词时要用“苏伊士运河”这个词，但在那个地方受了填词字数的限制，只许用四个字，他就把“苏”字砍去，成了“伊士运河”。就如苏东坡先生可称东坡先生一样，好像苏伊士运河也姓苏。这种办法太不高明了，即使要砍，砍“运”字比砍“苏”字还好一点。我们肯定新民歌有它的局限性，但真正有本事的人，他能够在局限中运用得很灵活。
    今天的新民歌，特别是农村中来的东西，一般说来比较接近于旧形式。其实，应该反过来说，旧形式是从民歌中产生的。比如七言诗，刚才说正式出现于曹丕的诗中，其实并不是曹丕或其他什么诗人创造出来的，最初是出现在民谣中。像“后汉书”上有些民谣和谚语多有七言的，又如新莽和东汉制造的铜镜背面的铭文也多有七言的，甚至有不少“七言镜”，一开始就说“七言之纪自镜始”。这些都是无名作家的作品，或汉代工人们的作品。所以七言诗是从民间来的。其所以然，也是因为生活发展的结果。生活发展了，语言发展了，原来四个字五个字一句的局限性增加了，所以在汉代就开始创造七言的句子。一般说，民间的东西总是跑在文人的前面。专业文人直到三国时的曹丕才用七言体来写“燕歌行”，而且只有这么两首。当时的曹氏父子、建安七子等的诗基本上都是五言的，甚至于还有四言的。到了唐朝七言才成为主流，民间的东西跑在前面很久。所以与其说民歌接近旧形式，不如说旧形式是从民歌中产生出来更恰当。
    今天的新民歌是在发展的，可能人民当中会创造一些新形式出来，到时候我们又要学习了。现在工人的诗和农民的诗就不大相同，这是因为他们接触的事物和生活习惯有些不同，所以他们的作品的调子也不同。将来农村工厂化，城乡差别消灭了，工农差别消灭了，特别是我们知识分子和工农的差别打消以后，那是会来一个大变化的，会有一个更自由的形式出来。诗本身的发展也是这样。当七言体成了固定的形式以后，民间的东西还是在打破它的局限，这就是用长短句，比如旧剧的唱词就爱采用“三三四”的调子。“我本是，卧龙岗，散淡的人”，这就是“三三四”的调子。七言体固定了以后，民间和文人还是在想办法突破它，可见它还是有局限性的，说新民歌毫无局限性是不符事实的。
    听起来好像是矛盾的，我觉得新民歌的好处就在它的有局限性，作者能在局限中表现得恰到好处，妙就妙在这里。这就是“又有纪律，又有自由”。本来，自由这个东西是在规律中的自由，如果是无规律的散漫的不羁之马之类的东西，那就不是自由而是放纵。事实上即使是放纵的诗，也还是有它的韵律的，你不能随便拿一篇散文来分行写就称它是诗，人家是不同意的。作为诗，总是有诗的性质在里面的。
            三、中国新诗在什么基础上发展？
    前面说过，对于这样的问题，大家的争论偏重于形式，我的看法不要偏重于形式。我很早就说过：形式不在乎新旧，主要是内容问题。用旧形式装上新的内容，我们不能不承认它是新东西；反过来，像徐志摩那样的东西我们能说它是新的吗？所以，对于新诗发展的基础，不应该从形式上去追求，而应该从劳动实践上，从知识分子和工农大众打成一片上去阐发。内容总是占领导地位的，政治第一，这是铁定不移的。有一定的内容，就会产生一定的形式。从前我们做新诗的人是垄断的，瞧不起旧形式，在编杂志时常常把旧的东西排斥在外，置之不理，甚至仇视旧的东西，把“人民内部矛盾”搞成了“敌对矛盾”。今天有些朋友仍存偏见，还在形式的新旧上争论不休。我们不要偏到这方面去，我们应该偏重到政治第一、劳动第一、生活第一方面去，在这个前提下，什么形式都可以。当然，在这个情况下生产出来的形式，很可能是自由诗和旧诗词进一步的结合。或者平行发展。五四以来的好的新诗，我们要知道，并不是完全脱离了旧诗词的影响。你在用中国话做诗，中国话本身的规律或韵律，你是不能违背的。
            四、怎样估计五四以来的新诗？
    五四以来的新诗还是有贡献的，应该肯定它的成绩。如反封建，解放个性，打破束缚，突破了旧诗词的清规戒律等是应该肯定的。虽然外来的影响很大，但就诗人来分类，也不能一律看待。旧体诗词和民间歌谣，经过几千年的选择、琢磨、流传，有它的好东西，今后还是有生命的。五四以来的诗歌，虽然受外来的影响，但它总是中国人用中国话写的诗，要守一定的规律，在这个规律里面活动。有些诗是有它存在的价值的，不能对五四以来的东西一概抹煞，我希望有人能够把五四以来的可取的东西选出来。
    五四以来的新诗形式注入今天的内容，它可以继续发展下去，新民歌的形式也会继续发展下去，这两种形式将来可能会来一个统一，也可能是各有千秋。新诗要垄断是很难的，如果不经常改变，它就会不新了。我们也很难说新民歌今后一万年都不会改变。
    我个人有这样的经验（可能也不仅仅是我个人有这样的经验），就是在大众的场合朗诵诗，旧诗和民歌的体裁不很合适，念起来既吃力而又单调，听的人也不容易懂。如果是唱或者配上竹板之类的拍打，那才对劲。光是朗诵，不如五四以来的自由诗。这次到朝鲜去，在志愿军总部举行的一个晚会上，大家要我朗诵我在国庆节写的那首长诗，我一面念，一面还要解释，搞了将近一小时，我自己吃力，听的人也吃力。通过唱或配上竹板的拍打，那多少成为带有音乐性的东西了，而在大众的场合完全靠诗歌本身发挥感人的力量，又要使大家都听得懂，恐怕还是自由诗更适宜一点。这是我的体会。假如我们对这一点也不愿肯定的话，未免太偏见了。当然，五四以来的新诗人应该很好的学习新民歌，同时把旧体诗词琢磨一番，使自己的诗更合乎中国的习惯和更适合中国语言的性质。
    对于“五四以来的新诗”这句话，我们应该有分析的来看。五四以来的新诗有各种各样的新诗，什么新月派、象征派，这个派那个派的，我也弄不大清楚。像李金发的诗不知道算什么派，实在叫人不懂，跟胡风的文章一样。
    毫无疑问，我们应该肯定五四运动的精神，要民主，要科学，在政治上表现出了反帝反封建，在文化上表现出了破除旧形式，打倒孔家店，把圣人和一切偶像送进茅坑。这种精神在当时来说还是有它的时代意义的。但在新诗中有各种各样的派别，各个诗人的成就也不一致。我们应该对五四以来这将近四十年中的可取的东西，作一个总的公平的评价。五四以来的有些新诗，如胡适的“尝试集”，根本就没有脱离旧的调子，像告示文似的，不知算个什么东西。但不能因此一笔抹煞新诗。比如刚才提到在朗诵时还是非自由诗不行。旧诗在古时有它的朗诵调子，这种调子拖得很长，现在朗诵起来大家会忍不住笑，因为现在和古时的生活习惯不同了。我没有到农村中去朗诵过，我估计如果到农村中去朗诵，恐怕还是自由诗比较容易听懂，因为它接近口头语言。至于民歌和旧诗词，前者还比较不那么艰深，后者不但农民听不懂，连我们知识分子也不一定都懂。比如克家解释毛主席的“送瘟神二首”，我觉得就很有些地方值得商榷的。所以我们还是要回到主席的话上来，旧诗词这个东西，表现得好，特别是巧妙地表现了新的内容，使人深深感到又有纪律又有自由，但要学很困难，要懂不容易，所以“不宜在青年中提倡”。主席这个指示是很宝贵的。当然谁都可以写，不限于我们这些老头子。青年们跃进得快，同时没有成见，真要认真钻研的话，也不是就学不会的。最困难的是五四以后成长起来的诗人，因为他已经有他自己的一套，很难钻进去。
    旧诗词就因为不易懂，因而每每一个人有一个人的解释。诗这个东西本来是很难解释的，特别是象征派的诗，那是最难解释的。主席的诗词当然不是象征派，但主席的诗词里是有象征的东西，每个词后面都可能有它的世界，所以解释可以有各种各样的不同。我们在解释时应该求得最接近于作者的原意，这样才比较心安理得一点。这里，不妨顺便说一说主席的两首“送瘟神”。
    这两首诗，我看是表示两个时代的，而“一样悲欢逐逝波”是一个关键，它为两个时代划了一条界线。“逝波”就是时间，人世上各种各样的悲欢离合都无可奈何地一同随着时间流逝。把这句诗掌握住，就知道它是分界：第一首写旧时代，第二首写新时代。“一样悲欢逐逝波”是对旧社会的消极的批判。在解放前的时代，有的人醉生梦死、得过且过，这是欢的代表；更多的人是民不聊生，这是悲的代表。不管你醉生梦死也好，民不聊生也好，都随着时间的消逝过去了。抓住这个关键，就能够知道第一首基本上是写解放前的旧时代，第二首是写解放后的新时代。可是在报刊上，却看到好些不同的解释。比如有人认为第一首的第五、六两句很积极，只有主席这样的身份才能经历，于是把第一首划成两段，前一段是悲，后一段是欢。这样解释的话，就不能和最后的那句总结合拍。这种解释正好说明他对中国旧诗是外行。
    第一首的第一二两句容易解释。在南方，很多地方有血吸虫，弄得名医如华佗都没有办法。血吸虫的历史很久了，有人说是从日本传来的，恐怕也不一定。
    第三四句——“千村薜苈人遗矢，万户萧疏鬼唱歌。”主席在这里用了个有关廉颇的典故。战国时赵王拟起用已退休的老将廉颇抵御秦兵，遣使者探望廉颇，秦国害怕廉颇复出，买通赵国的郭开，郭开指使去探望廉颇的使者向赵王做假报告，说老将同他吃了一顿饭，席间竟拉了三次矢（屎）。这就是所谓“一饭三遗矢”。赵王被骗，就没有起用廉颇。主席诗中“遗矢”的出处就在这里，那是说人没中用。在血吸虫的危害下，病人大着一个肚子，能吃不能做，劳动力没有了，庄稼因而荒废了；而死的人也非常多，有时候整个村子的人都死完了。这两句形容旧时代的老百姓不能聊生，所以它是悲的一面。
    但是旧时代也有享福的人，他们坐在地上不动，一天就游历了八万里。为什么？因为地球的圆周是八万华里，地球自转一周，坐在地上不动的人，也算作了一次逍遥游。从前周穆王才不过“八骏日行三万里”，不劳动的人一天坐着就跑了八万里，这不是比周穆王还要抖？“巡天”是说地球公转吧。一天要走五百多万华里，在太空中可以看到无数的星云，据近年来研究有一万个以上。性质和银河相似。“一千河”是指这些星云，“一千”只言其多，非确定的数目。但似乎也可以改为“十千”。从前唐明皇和叶法善游月宫是很逍遥的故事，旧时代有整夜不睡觉贪图欢乐的人，被地球带着公转，在夜里可以遥看到无数的银河，这不是比唐明皇还要抖？就这样，这五、六两句可以解释为欢的一面，也包含着“逝波”的观念。在旧时代有这样悲欢的对立，人民无可奈何，故“牛郎欲问瘟神事”，而所得到的回答，便只好是“一样悲欢逐逝波”了！旧时代千年万代都是一样，但这样的时代已经一去不复返了。这意思在第二首里面就要表达出来。
    第二首是写新时代。“春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧”，全国解放了，一切都不同了，每个人都是皇帝，而且都是中国人民理想中的好皇帝，是中国人民崇敬的圣人。“红雨随心翻作浪，青山着意化为桥”，一个“随心”，一个“着意”，这两个词用得太好了。这用的是拟人法。主席是善用拟人法的，就是把无生物当成人来写。红雨就是落花。落花在天空中翻作浪，不是随人们的意思在翻，而是随它自己的意思在翻。这表明落花也是有生命的，它也在大跃进。“青山着意化为桥”，从前的青山妨碍交通，还有什么瘴气之类的东西；今天的青山调节气候，防止涝旱，提供建筑木材，献出各种金属，它发挥着桥梁作用，而且是
  “着意”地化成了桥梁。不仅不再是障碍，而是对人民有帮助，对国民经济有贡献。就这样，在今天的大跃进中连山川草木都是有生命的，青山拼命地发挥经济作用，落花也感到万分的高兴和自由，在那里翻波涌浪，助长风光。山川草木都在跃进，人民自然更不用说了。一般诗人喜欢用“无心”和“有意”，在这里可以看到主席的语法，它不仅是“无心”，而且是“随心”；不仅是“有意”，而且是“着意”，这就特别生动有力。
    第三、四两句是从“春风杨柳万千条”来的，主席用对自然的描写来衬托我们伟大的时代。而第五、六两句则是从“六亿神州尽舜尧”继承下来的。“天连五岭银锄落”是写农村中的大跃进。农民们高举银锄，正在深翻土地，劈山开渠。“五岭”虽然在南方，但这里可以举一隅而反三，说了一个南方，北方也都是一样。“地动三河铁臂摇”，“三河”一般是指北方的，但同样的也可以举一反三包括南方。“铁臂”可以解释为劳动人民的手臂，如果和上句的“银锄”对照起来看，也可以作起重机、钻探机或风镐等解，所以这一句是写工业大跃进。“铁臂”把“三河”都摇动了，是多大的气势！就这么两句，概括了工农业的大跃进，表现了今天的唐尧虞舜的风度。加上三、四两句对自然风物的描写，把当前的大跃进充分形象化了。于是在这“纸船明烛照天烧”的情况下，瘟君又将何往呢？只有死路一条！在这里，主席运用了浪漫主义的手法，用从前的盂兰胜会上的习俗来表现消灭血吸虫。当然，血吸虫不是纸船一烧可以送走的，而是用科学方法送走的。但今天也还是在烧，那就是烧死传染血吸虫病的钉螺。钉螺是血吸虫的中间站，血吸虫的卵在钉螺体中孵化后才能兴妖作怪，所以要消灭血吸虫，必须消灭钉螺。的确，凡有血吸虫的地方处处都在烧，火光冲天。
    以上只是从诗的表面来解释的。主席为了消灭血吸虫组织了两首“送瘟神”，但我们也可以扩大一点，象征地来说，凡是反动派都是血吸虫，帝国主义、蒋介石、右派分子等等都是瘟神，在党的领导下，中国人民都已经把它们送走了。这是我的解释，跟克家同志和其他同志的解释有点不同。当然，我这也不一定正确，相信你们发表后，一定会有人不同意的。不过争鸣一下也好，百花齐放嘛。
    现在把话说回来，旧诗就有这样的困难。主席这两首十六句的诗，气魄雄浑，是革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义的很好的结合；但实在不容易懂，我自己也不敢说已经全懂。所以主席说：“这种体裁束缚思想”。总之，旧诗词中有好东西，但不等于旧诗词都好，那样就是以偏概全；反过来新诗中有坏东西，但不能就此说所有的新诗都不行，那样也是以偏概全。我们要公平的有分析的来看问题，从发展来看问题，从内容来看问题，从内容和形式的结合来看问题，这样，才能得到比较接近正确的见解。
    重复的说，对五四以来的新诗在精神上要肯定它，对各个诗人的作品应该有选择的对待，不能一概抹煞。五四以来的新诗还是有它的生命的，自由诗的路子还是一个可以走的路子。这是我个人的意见。
