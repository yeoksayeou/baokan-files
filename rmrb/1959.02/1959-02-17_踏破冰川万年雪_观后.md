After viewing "Treading Through the Glacier's Millennial Snow"

A good movie can often transport the audience into a realm of transformation, allowing their emotions to unconsciously blend into the atmosphere created by the film, forgetting that they are watching a movie. The 1958 production of the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, "Treading Through the Glacier's Millennial Snow," I believe, possesses this power.

In order to fundamentally solve the problem of water usage for industry and agriculture in the Northwest Plateau, the Chinese Academy of Sciences organized seven high-altitude glacier and snow utilization research teams last July and August to investigate the ice and snow resources of the Qilian Mountains. The film introduces the activities of the seventh team, which included mountaineers from the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission. Their task was to climb to the summit of the Shule Mountain, over 6,000 meters above sea level, within twenty days as a gift to the Party for National Day.

The film paints two extraordinary realms for us.

First, a wondrous and rare natural realm. Nature, with its incredibly skillful hand, has carved the snow on the Qilian Mountains into various forms such as ice cliffs, glaciers, ice humps, ice cups, and ice mushrooms. These are rarely seen in the human world, but the film vividly presents them before us. The film also allows us to see the unfathomable ice crevasses, which people cannot cross, but are connected by snow bridges; allows us to see large ice caves capable of holding more than a dozen people, with crystal-clear walls shimmering with emerald light, truly a genuine crystal palace; allows us to see the ice lake called "Heavenly Pool" and the ice stalactites commonly known as "ice pendants," which emit a faint sapphire light… If you think that just having photographic technology can achieve all of this, you would be mistaken. It involves the photographer's arduous climbing labor; moreover, because the ice is slippery and the snow is deep, the weather is freezing and the air pressure is low, the photographer's working conditions are extremely harsh, and there is a constant danger to life. It is not easy to capture these shots. Precisely because they overcame all kinds of difficulties, we can see the scenery in the Qilian Mountains.

Although the film introduces us to an icy and snowy crystal world, it does not give you a feeling of coldness, but a feeling of heat, making your hope of "contributing everything to the motherland" burn even more intensely. This is the second realm that the film creates for the audience, a solemn and great spiritual realm. The weather is so cold that when camping in the mountains, the tents often stick to people's noses, and accidentally rubbing against them can scrape off a layer of skin. But compared to the thrilling activities of crossing snow bridges and hanging in the air on a rope to take "ice samples" on steep cliffs, this seems insignificant. Because in these activities, a misstep will result in a broken body. It requires people to have the greatest courage and resourcefulness, the strongest will and perseverance. Through the struggle between man and nature, the film reveals that for the people and for socialist construction, mountaineers dare to despise all hardships, conquer all obstacles, and climb cliffs as if walking on flat ground. Although blizzards violently attack them, although it is so difficult to walk on peaks with thin air, and they have to gasp for breath after every step; they finally overcame the difficulties, successfully reached their destination, and obtained scientific research data. The film successfully portrays the activities of the mountaineers and their inner emotions, making us clearly understand that in front of these heroic Chinese people, any difficulty must surrender.

After watching the movie, I couldn't help but recall a past event: eight years ago, I traveled along the northwest foothills of the Qilian Mountains many times. Looking out from the car, on one side were continuous mountain peaks, and on the other side were grasslands and deserts. The car traveled for days without seeing the edge. But the farmers who were with us said that the Qilian Mountains are a treasure mountain, with gold and jade; and if someone could melt the snow on the mountains into water and wash away the alkali in the soil, the grain yield would be more than sand. However, no one had ever been inside at that time, and the situation in the mountains was still a mystery. People only had fantasies and hopes about it. Today, the country has conducted large-scale exploration of the Qilian Mountains, discovering more mineral deposits than estimated and water resources equivalent to five hundred Ming Tombs reservoirs, revealing this mystery; even the documentary "Treading Through the Glacier's Millennial Snow," which records the climb to the Shule Mountain peak, has been released! Life is advancing as quickly as a myth. The desolate area that the ancients thought was so frozen that horses' hooves would fall off has now become a glorious ornament of our era. Thinking about these things and seeing this film, I feel unspeakably excited.

    “踏破冰川万年雪”观后    
    商凉
    一部好电影往往能把观众引入化境，使人的感情不知不觉地融注在影片所创造出的氛围中间，忘却了自己是在看电影。中央新闻纪录电影制片厂1958年的产品“踏破冰川万年雪”，我认为就具有这样的力量。
    国家为了根本解决西北高原工农业的用水问题，去年7、8月间，由中国科学院组织了七个高山冰雪利用研究队，考察祁连山的冰雪资源。影片介绍了其中第七队的活动。这个队包括国家体委的登山运动员。他们的任务是要在二十天内登上拔海六千余公尺的疏勒山顶，作为国庆向党的献礼。
    影片为我们画出了两个非常的境界。
    第一是一个奇妙罕有的自然境界。大自然用它灵巧万分的手，将祁连山上的积雪，刻成了冰崖、冰川、冰瘤、冰杯、冰蘑菇等多种形象，这是人间少见的，但影片却使它们历历展现在我们面前。影片还让我们看到了深不可测的冰裂缝，人过不去，雪桥衔接了它们；让我们看到了可容十几人的大冰洞，四壁晶莹光洁，闪射着翡翠的光泽，那才是地道的水晶宫；让我们看到了被称为“天池”的冰湖和俗称“冰凌”的冰钟乳，它们发出淡淡的蓝宝石的光芒……。如果以为只要有照相技术就能得到这一切，那就错了。这里面包含着摄影师的辛勤的登山劳动；而且因为冰滑雪深，天冻气压低，摄影师的工作条件极其严酷，随时有生命的危险，摄取这些镜头是非常不易的。正因为他们克服了种种艰难，才让我们看到了祁连山中的风光。
    虽然影片把我们引入一个冰天雪地的水晶世界，但是给你的不是寒冷，而是炽热的感觉，使你心里“愿为祖国贡献一切”的希望烧得更猛烈。这就是影片为观众所创造的第二个境界、一种庄严伟大的精神境界。天气是那么寒冷，在山中露宿，帐篷往往贴着人们的鼻子，不小心擦一下，就会蹭掉一层皮肉。但是比起过雪桥和靠一根绳子悬在空中到陡壁上取“冰样”等惊险活动来，这又显得微不足道了。因为在这些活动中，一失足就会粉身碎骨。它要求人们具有最大的勇敢和机智，最强的意志和毅力。影片通过人与自然的斗争，揭示了登山者为人民、为社会主义建设敢于藐视一切艰险，征服所有障碍，攀登绝壁如履平地。虽然暴风雪向他们猛烈地袭来，虽然在空气稀薄的山峰上行进是那么困难，走一步就得喘息一阵；但是他们终于克服了困难，胜利地达到目的地，取得了科学研究资料。影片成功地表现了登山者的活动和他们的内心情绪，使我们清楚地理解到，在这些英雄的中国人们面前，任何困难也要俯首投降。
    看完电影，我情不自禁地想起一段往事：八年前，我曾沿祁连山西北麓旅行多次。在汽车里望出去，一边是绵亘不绝的山峰，一边是草原、戈壁。车行几天不见边际。但和我们一起的农民却说，祁连山是个宝山，有金、有玉；而且如果谁能把山上的雪化成水，洗掉土里的碱，粮就能出得比沙还多。不过当时谁也没有进去过，山里的情况还是个谜，人们对它只是有着幻想和希望罢了。如今，国家大规模地勘探了祁连山，发现了比估计多得多的矿藏和相当于五百个十三陵水库的水力资源，揭穿了这个谜；甚至，连攀登疏勒山峰的记录片“踏破冰川万年雪”也问世了！生活跟神话一样迅速前进。古人认为冰冻百丈，马行蹄脱的绝域，在今天，却都成了我们时代的光辉饰物。想着这些事情，看到这部影片，心里真是说不出的激动。
