Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 1st February - Jilin Province recently held an on-site conference in Baicheng Prefecture to exchange experiences in the application of wind power, deciding to develop 70,000 windmills throughout the province this year.

Baicheng Prefecture is a sparsely populated, sandy, and arid area in northwestern Jilin Province. In 1956, in order to turn wind disasters into wind benefits, they began to research, trial-produce, and vigorously promote windmills. Up to now, there have been 1,691 windmills of various types distributed throughout the area.

Through on-site visits, the conference believed that utilizing wind power had many advantages, as it could save labor and animal power; windmills could also save fuel and steel as power applications. In Tao'an County, Taodong Township, a "55" type windmill was used to draw water, irrigating 15 mu of land in one day and night. In the same amount of time, using two people and two horses to draw water only irrigated 9 mu. Last year, Baicheng Prefecture irrigated 58,900 mu of land with windmills, saving a large amount of labor and animal power, and increasing grain production significantly. The efficiency of using wind power for agricultural product processing was one to nineteen times higher than in the past. Wind power generation also had good results. The "August 1st" wind turbine in Tao'an County could generate electricity normally in force 4 winds.

The conference believed that the promotion of windmills must adhere to the principles of prioritizing production, prioritizing small size, prioritizing commune operation, prioritizing indigenous methods, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. In terms of use, the focus should be on solving irrigation problems, while also combining agricultural and sideline product processing and power generation.

    发展七万部风车
    吉林决定广泛使用风力灌溉和加工
    据新华社长春1日电　吉林省最近在白城地区召开风动力应用经验交流现场会议，决定今年全省要发展七万部风车。
    白城专区是吉林省西北部的一个地广人稀、风沙干旱的地区。1956年，他们为了变风灾为风利，着手研究试制和大力推广风车，到现在已经有一千六百九十一台各种类型风车分布全区各地。
    会议通过现场参观，认为利用风力好处很多，可以节省劳力、畜力；风车作为动力应用还可以节省燃料、钢材。洮安县洮东乡用一台“五五”型风车提水，一昼夜就灌田十五亩。同样的时间，用两人两马提水，只灌了九亩。去年白城地区用风车灌溉面积达五万八千九百亩，节省了大批劳力和畜力，增产了很多粮食。运用风力进行农产品加工，效率比过去提高了一倍到十九倍。风力发电效果也很好。洮安县“八一”号风力发电机在四级风时就可以正常发电。
    会议认为目前在推广风车中必须本着以生产为主，小型为主，社办为主，土法为主，土洋结合的原则进行。在使用上应以解决灌溉为主，同时结合农付产品加工、发电。
