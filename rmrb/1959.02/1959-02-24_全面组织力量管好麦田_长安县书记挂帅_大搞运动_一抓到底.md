    Comprehensively Organize Forces to Manage Wheat Fields
    Chang'an County Secretary Takes the Lead, Launches a Large-Scale Campaign, and Grasps It to the End

    (Our newspaper, Xi'an, February 23rd) Shaanxi's Chang'an County has decided to adopt five major measures to strengthen the management of wheat during the greening period. At a recent four-level cadre meeting, the county, based on the notice from the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, earnestly studied the People's Daily editorial "Get Through the Wheat Greening Stage Well" and decided to mobilize the entire party and all the people in the coming month to vigorously engage in wheat field management. The aim is to ensure that every plant produces ears, every ear increases grains, and every grain is full, striving to become a county with a per-mu yield of 1,200 jin.

    During the meeting, Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave instructions, saying: Striving for a greater wheat harvest is extremely important for ensuring the completion of the annual grain production task. Field management during the wheat greening period has a decisive impact on wheat yield increase. We must, in the spirit of the People's Daily editorial "Get Through the Wheat Greening Stage Well," bring forth the same drive as we did in the large-scale steel production campaign last year, and vigorously engage in field management during the wheat greening period. Specific plans should be made and earnestly implemented regarding ideological work, organizational work, technical measures, solving specific problems, and improving leadership methods and working methods. The first secretaries of the Party committees and the secretaries in charge of agriculture should focus on field management during the wheat greening period as a priority, emphasizing it, closely grasping it, specifically grasping it, and grasping it thoroughly. From the wheat greening period, the jointing period, the booting period to the harvesting period, we will grasp it segment by segment, striving for a greater wheat harvest this year. Zhang Desheng also worked with the county's cadres to formulate five measures for wheat field greening management.

    The five measures are: (1) Continue to overcome complacency and relaxation, widely carry out a mass debate to analyze the favorable and unfavorable conditions for a bumper harvest; learn from the experience of per-mu yields of 1,000 jin and 2,000 jin last year to enhance the confidence of cadres and the masses. (2) Mobilize the masses to inspect all wheat fields plot by plot, classify them according to growth conditions, and formulate field management measures for each plot. Before mid-March, apply another 10,000 jin of soil fertilizer per mu to general wheat fields. In addition to applying another 10,000 jin of soil fertilizer to large-area high-yield fields, apply 4,000 jin of urea and 1,000 jin of wood ash (or 20 jin of potassium fertilizer). Irrigate in a timely manner to prevent drought. For overly dense wheat seedlings, pilot artificial rainfall. Before mid-March, roll all wheat fields once, harrow once, and hoe once to ensure weed-free fields, no soil crusting, and no clods of manure. Make preparations for disease prevention, pest control, frost prevention, and lodging prevention in advance, especially preparing medicines and equipment for the prevention and control of stripe rust. Before early March, spray all wheat fields with 3-7% ammonium sulfate. (3) Arrange grain work once for each commune and team, practice strict economy, and oppose waste. Consolidate welfare organizations such as kindergartens and nurseries to reduce the burden on women. Strengthen collaboration between industrial, agricultural, and commercial departments, requiring industrial departments to produce 1,000 tons of potassium fertilizer before the end of March; commercial departments to prepare 1.25 million jin of ammonium sulfate, 200,000 jin of lime-sulfur mixture, and 420,000 jin of salt before the end of February. At the same time, vigorously engage in tool reform, seizing transportation tools and field management tools such as weeding hoes, harrows, and clod crushers. (4) The first secretaries of county and commune Party committees and the secretaries in charge of agriculture should currently focus on wheat greening work. Leadership cadres at all levels should implement a system of contracted responsibility at each level. Transfer cadres to communes to work as commune members to boost the morale of the commune members. (5) Boost morale, create a high tide, vigorously launch mass movements, carry out red flag competitions, and conduct five checks and five comparisons: check measures and compare results, check drive and compare efficiency, check advanced methods and compare quality, check technology and compare effectiveness, check research and compare innovation. Currently, commune members in various communes of the county are busily applying fertilizer, watering, rolling, and harrowing to the wheat fields. Those who have not built good ridges are busy building ridges. Approximately 50% of the county's labor force has been successively transferred to the wheat field management front, fiercely attacking the wheat greening barrier. Various communes have also strengthened the responsibility system for wheat field management. (Attached Images)

    全面组织力量管好麦田
    长安县书记挂帅　大搞运动　一抓到底
    本报西安23日电　陕西长安县决定采取五大措施加强小麦返青管理。这个县在最近举行的四级干部会议上，根据中共陕西省委的通知，认真地学习了人民日报“过好小麦返青关”的社论，决定在最近一个月内，全党全民动手，狠狠地抓麦田管理。保证株株出穗，穗穗增粒，粒粒饱满，争取成为亩产一千二百斤县。
    会议期间，中共陕西省委第一书记张德生曾到会作了指示，他说：争取小麦更大丰收，对于确保完成全年粮食生产任务十分重要。小麦返青期的田间管理，对小麦增产有着决定性影响，必须根据人民日报“过好小麦返青关”社论的精神，拿出像去年大搞钢铁运动那样的干劲，大搞小麦返青期的田间管理。应当从思想工作、组织工作、技术措施、解决具体问题、改进领导方法和工作方法等方面，作出具体规划，认真贯彻执行。党委的第一书记和主管农业的书记，最近都应当把小麦返青期间的田间管理当作重点抓起来，突出地抓，紧紧地抓，具体地抓，抓深抓透。从小麦返青期、拔节期、孕穗期直到收割期，一段一段地抓下去，争取今年小麦的更大丰收。张德生还和该县的干部一起制订了麦田返青管理的五项措施。
    五项措施的内容是：（1）继续克服自满松劲情绪，广泛开展全民大辩论，分析丰收的有利条件和不利因素；学习去年亩产千斤、双千斤的经验，增强干部和群众的信心。（2）发动群众对所有麦田逐块进行检查，按照生长情况分类排队，逐块订出田间管理措施。3月中旬以前，一般麦田每亩再施土肥一万斤。大面积丰产田除再施一万斤土肥外，加施人造尿四千斤，草木灰一千斤（或钾肥二十斤）。适时春灌，地不缺墒，苗不受旱，麦苗过稠的，重点试行人工降雨。3月中旬以前，所有麦田镇压一次，耙耱一次，锄一次，保证田无杂草、地不结板、粪无土块。提前做好防病、防虫、防霜、防倒伏的准备工作，特别要准备好条锈病的防治药械。3月上旬以前，对所有麦田喷洒37％的硫酸铵。（3）逐社逐队安排一次粮食工作，厉行节约，反对浪费。整顿幼儿园、托儿所等福利组织，减少妇女拖累。加强工、农、商部门之间的协作，要求工业部门在3月底以前制造钾肥一千吨；商业部门在2月底以前，准备好硫酸铵一百二十五万斤，石灰硫磺合剂二十万斤，食盐四十二万斤。同时，还要大搞工具改革，抓紧运输工具和锄草、耙、耱等田间管理工具。（4）县、社党委第一书记和主管农业的书记，目前集中地突出地抓小麦返青工作。各级领导干部实行层层包干。抽调干部下放公社当社员，以鼓舞社员的士气。（5）鼓干劲、搞高潮，大搞群众运动，开展红旗竞赛，进行五查五比：查措施比战果，查干劲比效率，查先进比质量，查技术比效果，查钻研比创造。现在，这个县各公社的社员们正在紧张地给麦田追肥、浇水、镇压、耙耱，没打好畦子的正在忙着打畦子。全县约有50％的劳力已经先后转移到麦田管理战线上来，猛攻小麦返青关。各公社还加强了麦田管理的责任制。（附图片）
