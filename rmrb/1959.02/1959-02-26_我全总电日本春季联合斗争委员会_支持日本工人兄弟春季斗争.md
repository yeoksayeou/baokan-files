　　Xinhua News Agency, February 25th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a cable to the Japanese Spring Struggle Joint Struggle Committee on the 24th, expressing deep sympathy, respect, and support for the Japanese workers' spring struggle to abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's anti-China reactionary policies, and strive for peaceful neutrality and improved living conditions.

　　The telegram said: "Nobusuke Kishi's attempt to revive Japanese militarism and his potential imperialist ambitions to once again interfere in Taiwan and expand into Southeast Asia have been more clearly exposed in his attempts to revise the 'Police Duties Law' and revise the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty,' and are being met with increasingly fierce opposition from the Japanese people and the people of Asian and African countries. We wish the Japanese worker brothers greater achievements in this struggle through closer unity and broad united action." Latin American Spring Tide Bursts Forth

    我全总电日本春季联合斗争委员会
    支持日本工人兄弟春季斗争
    新华社25日讯　中华全国总工会24日致电日本春季斗争联合斗争委员会，对日本工人要求废除日美“安全条约”、反对岸信介政府敌视中国的反动政策、争取和平中立和改善生活条件的春季斗争，表示深切的同情、敬意和支持。
    电报说：“岸信介企图复活日本军国主义，重新染指台湾和向东南亚扩张的潜在帝国主义野心，已在企图修改‘警职法’和修订日美‘安全条约’的过程中更明显地暴露出来，并且受到日本人民和亚非各国人民越来越激烈的反对。祝日本工人兄弟以更紧密的团结和广泛的统一行动，在这一斗争中获得更大的成就。”拉丁美洲春潮迸发
