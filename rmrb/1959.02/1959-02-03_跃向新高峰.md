Leaping to New Heights
By our reporters Ji Xichen and Sun Yuedong

Amidst the high tide of striving for a greater leap forward, a red flag of large-scale high yield is flying high in Anyue County, in the central Sichuan Basin. Welcoming this red flag, we followed thousands of visitors here. Although it is still winter here, the people's soaring enthusiasm has turned winter into spring, and the fields are filled with the vitality of a fighting spring.

Along the rolling hills, the car travels through large tracts of high-yield roads, high-yield dams, high-yield ditches, and high-yield slopes. Neat and lush wheat fields, like rolling green waves, wrap around the undulating land. Each piece of land is marked with a wooden sign indicating high-yield targets, increased production measures, and the field manager.

In order to achieve a harvest of 350,000 mu of wheat several times greater than last year, a professional management team of 70,000 to 80,000 people, along with more than 100,000 people temporarily supporting the field management, are again treating the wheat for pests, irrigating, topdressing fertilizer, and meticulously managing it. They are responsible for specific areas and contracted at different levels, with dedicated personnel managing from planting to harvesting. To prevent excessive growth and lodging, in addition to applying more phosphorus and potassium fertilizer, plant ash, and soil around the wheat roots, some have boldly adopted new technologies such as root pressing, topping, leaf pruning, and removing dew. In addition, they have set up observation stations and observation posts in the fields, and promptly take corresponding measures based on field temperature, rainfall, pests, and crop growth changes. Now, many wheat seedlings have grown to a foot tall, some have already begun to spike, and they are even, dense, and strong. The masses generally reflected: "Since the beginning of the world, we have never seen such good wheat seedlings!"

After seeing the wheat and rapeseed of the Longtai People's Commune, everyone felt extremely happy for the summer harvest that is about to come this year. The commune's more than 24,000 mu of wheat and rapeseed have been universally topdressed, cultivated, and treated for pests three or four times. When the wheat elsewhere was just beginning to joint, the wheat on Qinjiaba had grown to one or two feet tall, with an average of sixty to seventy main spikes per square meter. The green stalks and leaves, like fluffy and thick cotton quilts, evenly sealed the ground. Only when people peeled open the wheat rows could they see a little gap, and the roots of the wheat, according to observation, had penetrated one or two feet deep into the soil. The average yield of wheat here last year was more than 200 jin per mu, and this year it is required to reach more than 3,000 jin.

In a rapeseed high-yield experimental garden called the "Rapeseed Kingdom," we saw those future rapeseed kings, with sparse plants in large clusters. Each plant has grown more than four feet tall, with more than forty budding branches and leaves, with a circumference diameter of more than five feet, like a small jungle, attracting everyone who passes by to stop and admire this miracle. According to Comrade Huang Zhongxia, the commune's head, there are still three or four months before the rapeseed harvest. As long as we manage it well, each rapeseed plant is estimated to yield five to ten jin of rapeseed.

Anyue County is known throughout the province for its ability to seize large-scale high-yield fields in the steady implementation of the policy of planting less for high yield and more income. Zhao Kejin, the first secretary of the county party committee, said that this was forced upon them by years of extensive planting and low yields. He said that the county's soil is very thin and infertile. Many slopes have only a few inches of topsoil. With extensive planting and low yields, each mu yielded only 150 jin. This year, in order to ensure a high yield of 2,000 to 3,000 jin per mu, the county has大規模(dà guīmó)ly adjusted the planting area, changing the past unreasonable phenomenon of decentralized planting regardless of soil fertility, and concentrating most of the wheat in the better dam areas, dry fields, and bottomland. In order to concentrate efforts on cultivating these fields, the county held more than 5,000 high-yield technical training classes. From the county party committee to the branch secretaries, everyone received training. Hundreds of thousands of laborers, according to the requirements of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, went through days of hard work, combined with deep plowing and soil fumigation, and layered fertilization to transform large tracts of land into high-yield land that could achieve high yields. Summer crop land was universally deep plowed one and a half to two and three feet, with base fertilizer of 150,000 to 200,000 jin, to achieve deep plowing, abundant fertilizer, sufficient seeds, loose soil, and suitable dryness and wetness. Because these high-yield lands are relatively concentrated, they are not only convenient for cultivation and management, but also convenient for building residential areas and dividing cultivated areas, creating favorable conditions for the gradual realization of mechanization and electrification in the future.

In the great struggle to strive for a greater leap forward, while striving for a summer harvest, people have also begun spring plowing and production activities. Under the warm sun, in the lush green valleys, in rows of rice fields, the mountains and fields are full of people accumulating fertilizer, delivering manure, turning the soil, and preparing the fields. In order to ensure that the county's 600,000 mu of rice and 300,000 mu of cotton have sufficient fertilizer, the county has launched a大规模(dà guīmó) fertilizer accumulation campaign. More than 200,000 people participating in fertilizer accumulation adopted the method of accumulating, manufacturing, and transporting simultaneously, with fixed personnel, fixed quality, and fixed quantity contracting responsibilities, making an overall plan for fertilizer sources, manpower, and plots, so that "people have fertilizer and fertilizer has land," and in just five days, they accumulated more than 100 million loads of fertilizer. Communes such as Chengbei, Longtai, and Zhenzi gave play to their hard-working spirit, newly plowed thousands of mu of basic paddy fields, applied sufficient base fertilizer, repaired the field ridges, and filled them with water. Luo Yunke, the 17th team leader of the Chengbei Commune, led his team, dragging dozens of specially-made fertilizer transport boats, and standing in the knee-deep mud fields, completely covering a 40-mu paddy field with several inches of soil fertilizer.

This year's great leap forward has made cultivation particularly early. In previous years, no one would have deeply plowed cotton fields at this time, but this year, the deep plowing and soil sunning of cotton fields began one and a half months earlier. Early plowing and early sunning are equivalent to applying fertilizer once more. Kang Gongcai, a communist party member of Tongxian Commune, who plowed more than 1,200 mu of cotton fields, took more than 40 team members to the mountain slope as soon as it was dawn. The entire team was divided into two shifts, one shift shoveling grass to make compost, and the other plowing the land with cattle and sunning the soil. Kang Gongcai said to us with a smile: "Look, we will not only have a harvest in the summer, but also a greater harvest in the autumn!"

    跃向新高峰
    本报记者　纪希晨　孙跃冬
    在争取更大跃进的高潮里，一面大面积高产的红旗，在四川盆地中部的安岳县高高升起。迎着这面红旗，我们随着成千的参观者来到这里。现在这儿虽然还是冬天，可是人们的冲天干劲却把冬天变成了春天，田野里到处充满着战斗的春天的景气。
    沿着连绵的丘陵，车子在大片大片的丰产路、丰产坝、丰产沟、丰产坡中穿来穿去，一块块整齐茂密的麦畦，像滚腾的绿色的波浪，裹卷着起伏的大地。每块地的地边上都树立着写有丰产指标、增产措施和田间管理人的木牌标记。
    为着使三十五万亩小麦比去年多得几倍的丰收，七八万人的专业管理队伍，配合着临时前去支援突击田间管理的十多万人，正再次给小麦治虫、灌水、追肥，精细地进行着管理。他们分片负责，分层包干，从种到收专人管理，为防止疯长和倒伏，在增施磷钾肥、草木灰和给麦根围土的同时，有的还大胆地采用了压根、打顶、剪叶、赶露水等新技术。此外，他们还在田间设立观察站、观察哨，及时根据田间气温、雨量、病害及作物生长变化情况，采取相应的措施。现在，许多麦苗都长到一尺高，有的已经孕穗，并且作到苗匀、苗密、苗壮不倒。群众普遍反映：“盘古开天地，没有见过这样好的麦苗！”
    看了龙台人民公社的麦子、油菜，人人都为今年即将到来的夏季大丰收，感到无比的欢欣。这个社的两万四千多亩小麦、油菜，普遍追肥、中耕、治虫达三、四次。当别处的小麦还刚刚拔节的时候，秦家坝上的小麦已长到一两尺高，平均每平方公尺有六七十支主穗。绿油油的秆叶，像蓬松厚实的棉被，均匀地密封着地面，只当人们用手剥开麦垅的时候，方能看到一点缝隙，而麦子的根部据观察已入土一两尺深。此地去年小麦平均每亩产二百多斤，今年要求达到三千斤以上。
    在一处被称作“油菜王国”的油菜高产试验园里，我们看到了那些未来的油菜王，稀株大窝，每株已长有四尺多高，开盘的四十多苔枝叶，圆周直径达五尺多，活像一窝小丛林，惹得每个路过这儿的人，都要停下来观赏一下这个奇迹。据公社社长黄仲霞同志说，现在距油菜收获还有三、四个月的时间，只要好好管理，每一株油菜估计可收菜籽五至十斤。
    安岳县在稳步贯彻少种高产多收的方针中，以善于抓大面积高产田闻名全省。县委第一书记赵科进谈到这点时说，这是被多年的广种薄收逼上梁山的。他说，全县土质十分薄瘦。许多坡地只有几寸厚的土层，广种薄收时，每亩只有一百五十斤的收成。今年为了每亩保证高产二、三千斤，全县曾大规模地调整了种植区域，改变了过去不分土质肥瘦、分散种植的不合理现象，把大部麦子都集中播种在条件较好的坝地、干田和漕土里。为集中力量种好这些田土，全县举办了五千多人的高产技术训练班，从县委到支部书记普遍受过训练，几十万劳动大军根据农业“八字宪法”的要求，经历多日苦战，结合深耕熏土，分层施肥，把大片土地改造成能够实现高产的丰产地。夏熟作物地普遍深耕一尺五到二三尺，底肥十五万到二、三十万斤，做到深耕、肥多、种足、土壤松软、干湿适宜。这些丰产地由于比较集中，不仅便于耕作管理，而且便于修建居民点和划分耕作区，为今后逐步实现机械化和电气化创造了有利条件。
    在争取更大的跃进的伟大斗争中，人们在力争夏季丰收的同时，也开始了春耕生产的活动。温暖的太阳下，翠绿的山谷里，一列列的稻田中，满山遍野都是积肥、送粪、翻地、整田的人群。为确保全县六十万亩水稻、三十万亩棉花都能有充足的肥料，全县开展了大规模的积肥运动，参加积肥的二十多万群众，采用边积、边造、边运，定人、定质、定量的包干负责办法，将肥源、人力、地块作了全面规划，作到“人有肥、肥有田”只五天就突击积肥一亿多挑。城北、龙台、镇子等公社发挥苦干精神，新翻了成千亩水稻基本农田，施足底肥，修好田坎，灌满了水。城北公社十七中队长罗运科领着队员，拖着几十只特制的运肥小船，站在没及膝盖的泥田里，把一块四十亩的稻田，全部铺上几寸厚的土肥。
    今年的大跃进使耕作特别提早。往年这个时候，根本没人深翻棉花地，可是今年都提前一个半月开始了棉花地的深翻炕土，早耕早炕，等于多施一次肥料。翻犁了一千二百多亩棉花地的通贤公社，共产党员康供财，天刚亮就带着四十多个队员上了山坡。全队分成两班，一班铲草沤粪，一班?牛翻地炕土。康供财笑着对我们说：“看吧，我们不光有丰收的夏天，还会有更大丰收的秋天！”
