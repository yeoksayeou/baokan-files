Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 1st: The Hungarian News Agency reports that the Press Bureau of the Hungarian Foreign Ministry was authorized on January 31st to issue a communiqué on the issue of Hungarian-U.S. relations.

The communiqué stated that the Hungarian government, in a note to the U.S. government on January 27th, pointed out that the U.S. Embassy in Budapest and U.S. organizations engaged in illegal activities had been conducting sabotage activities that endanger the state and social order of the Hungarian People's Republic, and reiterated that this situation could not continue. To this end, the Hungarian government suggested that Hungary and the U.S. hold diplomatic negotiations to eliminate the phenomena hindering the normalization of relations between the two countries.

The communiqué stated that, however, on January 31st, the U.S. Embassy in Budapest, using the pretext that the Hungarian government's note was "threatening," returned it to the Hungarian Foreign Ministry. Therefore, the Hungarian government believes that the U.S. government is not prepared to resolve the current problems through normal diplomatic channels. This leaves the Hungarian government with no choice but to take measures to restrict activities that threaten the state and social order of Hungary.

The communiqué also pointed out that the Hungarian government once again stated that its desire to normalize relations between Hungary and the U.S. remains unchanged.

    匈外交部新闻司发表公报
    美国政府既然无意使两国关系正常化
    匈牙利将采取措施限制美国非法活动
    新华社布达佩斯1日电　据匈牙利通讯社报道：匈牙利外交部新闻司1月31日受权就匈牙利和美国关系问题发表一项公报。
    公报说，匈牙利政府今年1月27日曾经照会美国政府，指出美国驻布达佩斯公使馆和从事非法活动的美国组织曾进行危害匈牙利人民共和国国家和社会秩序的破坏活动，并重申这种局势不能再继续下去。为此，匈牙利政府建议匈、美双方举行外交谈判，以消除阻碍匈美两国关系正常化的现象。
    公报说，然而，美国驻布达佩斯公使馆1月31日以匈牙利政府的照会带有“威胁”性质为借口，把它退还给匈牙利外交部。因此，匈牙利政府认为，美国政府是不准备通过正常的外交途径来解决目前存在的问题的。这使匈牙利政府不得不采取措施，来限制威胁匈牙利国家和社会秩序的活动。
    公报同时指出，匈牙利政府再一次表示，它的打算使匈美两国关系正常化的意愿仍然没有改变。
