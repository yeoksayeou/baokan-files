Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The convening of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Khrushchev's report on the control figures for the development of the Soviet national economy for 1959-1965, are attracting worldwide attention. Many bourgeois newspapers in capitalist countries have reported and commented on this magnificent plan for building communism and the congress of communist builders.

    In a lengthy article, the "Financial Times" compared the development rates of the Soviet Union and the United States regarding the economic tasks stipulated in Khrushchev's report, and reached the conclusion that Soviet industrial production is growing much faster than that of the United States.

    The newspaper pointed out that, according to the targets of the Seven-Year Plan, by 1965, the output of some sectors of the Soviet Union will approach and, in some respects, exceed the current output of the United States. Soviet consumers will have "more spacious housing, more textiles and fabrics, more leisure time, higher wages, and increased consumption of household goods."

    Agence France-Presse commentator Fejdo, in discussing Khrushchev's speech, pointed out that "the most striking thing is that his speech has a clear sense of optimism." He particularly noted the "speaker's confidence."

    Canadian newspapers, in analyzing Khrushchev's report, drew two main conclusions: first, Western countries cannot but accept the Soviet Union's challenge of peaceful competition between the socialist system and the capitalist system; second, the principle of coexistence between countries with different economic and social systems and abandoning the "Cold War" is the only feasible policy at present.

    The "Toronto Daily Star" pointed out that the speed of developing the Soviet economy stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan far exceeds the speed of development of the American economy in its most "prosperous" years. The lives of Soviet people will be richer, more affluent, and more perfect. After surpassing all other countries in production, they will have a wealth of food and excellent housing.

    The newspaper continued that the broad program of peaceful construction elaborated in Khrushchev's report leaves no doubt about the Soviet Union's policy of maintaining peace. The newspaper emphasized that Western countries should take Khrushchev's call to end the "Cold War" very seriously.

    The "Financial Post" believes that the most dangerous thing is that Western countries underestimate the Soviet Union's magnificent construction plan.

    Montreal's "Star" wrote, "Soviet technological progress has exceeded all foreign expectations. In the West, we should avoid underestimating Russian achievements at all costs."

    The West German newspaper "Westfälische Rundschau" wrote in its editorial: "Past experience shows that the Soviet Union has basically always been able to realize its economic plans. The broad foundation that the Soviet economy possesses today makes one believe that it can also carry out the tasks proposed." The editorial also pointed out that those who are committed to realizing these economic plans "must truly care about maintaining universal peace."

    The West German "Die Welt" also acknowledged that the tasks stipulated in Khrushchev's report on the Seven-Year Plan for the development of the Soviet national economy are realistic. The newspaper wrote that after the first man-made satellite and man-made "planet" made in the Soviet Union entered outer space, all news about the growth of Soviet power made Western countries take it seriously.

    The "Süddeutsche Zeitung" wrote on the 28th: Khrushchev's report is a "brilliant picture of a future with strong development and a willingness for peace, with economic development and social services." The newspaper said that the Soviet Union "today has three times more students in school than the total number of students in the four major countries of Western Europe, which alone is remarkable. The announced 80% increase in (industrial) production in the next seven years is absolutely possible, because it is in line with the growth rate of the past few years."

    The Italian "Il Popolo" said in its commentary on the Seven-Year Plan: "This plan should be treated with extreme seriousness unconditionally... When Stalin announced the first Five-Year Plan in 1929, most international observers did not take it seriously. Today, the same mistake must not be made again."

    "Giustizia" believes that "if anyone in the West still wants to deny the great achievements made by the Soviet Union in industrial development and agricultural production, then he is not only denying obvious facts, but also running the risk of distorting the balance of economic power between the Soviet Union and Western countries."

    The "Schweizerische Zeitung" pointed out the important significance of the Soviet economic plan stipulating that the Soviet Union should catch up with the United States, which is the leading industrial country in the world, and pointed out that this stipulation is well-founded. It warned people not to underestimate the inventions and labor capacity of the Soviet people, and pointed out that the Soviet Union has already taken the lead in conquering space in its competition with the United States.

    Many Swiss newspapers also pointed out that Khrushchev's report is proof of the Soviet Union's desire for peace and its hope to ease international tensions in the near future. The "National Zeitung" wrote, "Khrushchev has once again shown that he is a peace activist, and he needs peace to realize his plans..."

    The Swiss "Lausanne Gazette" pointed out that Khrushchev's report "most clearly shows that the Soviet Union will continue to take action more firmly in peaceful competition." (Attached picture)

### 西方资产阶级报刊纷纷承认  苏联七年计划规模宏伟  和平共处原则势在必行

    西方资产阶级报刊纷纷承认
    苏联七年计划规模宏伟  和平共处原则势在必行
    据新华社讯  苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的召开，和赫鲁晓夫在大会上作的1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的控制数字的报告，正吸引着全世界的舆论。许多资本主义国家的资产阶级报刊都纷纷报道和评论这个建设共产主义的宏伟计划和共产主义建设者的代表大会。
    “金融时报”在一篇长篇文章中就赫鲁晓夫报告中所规定的经济任务，把苏联和美国的发展速率作了比较，并且得到了这样的结论：苏联工业生产比美国增长的要快得多。
    这家报纸指出，根据七年计划的指标，到1965年，苏联若干部门的产量将接近和在某些方面超过目前美国的产量。苏联的消费者将有“更宽敞的住房、更多的纺织品和布匹，更多的休息时间，更高的工资，在家庭用品的消费方面也将有所增加”。
    法新社评论员费日多在谈到赫鲁晓夫的发言时指出，“最引人注目的东西就是他的发言有一种明显的乐观情绪”。他特别指出了“发言者的自信心”。
    加拿大报纸在分析赫鲁晓夫的报告时得出了两个主要结论：第一，西方国家不能不接受苏联的关于社会主义制度和资本主义制度进行和平竞赛的挑战；第二，具有不同经济制度和社会制度的国家共处的原则和放弃“冷战”，是目前唯一可行的政策。
    “多伦多每日星报”指出，七年计划所规定的发展苏联经济的速度远远超过美国经济在最“景气”年代里的发展速度。苏联人的生活将更加充实、更加富裕和更加完美。他们在生产方面超过其他所有国家之后，将得到各种丰富的食品和很好的住宅。
    这家报纸继续说，在赫鲁晓夫的报告中所阐述的和平建设的广泛纲领，不容对苏联维护和平的政策有任何的怀疑。这家报纸着重指出，西方国家应当十分认真地对待赫鲁晓夫提出的结束“冷战”的号召。
    “金融邮报”认为，西方国家对苏联的宏伟的建设计划估计不足是最危险的事情。
    蒙特利尔的“明星报”写道，“苏联的技术进步已经超出了外国的一切预料。在西方，我们应当千万避免轻视俄国的成就。”
    西德报纸“威斯特伐利亚评论报”的社论写道：“过去的经验表明，苏联直到现在基本上总是能实现自己的经济计划的。苏联的经济今天拥有的这样广泛的基础，使人相信它也能执行所提出的任务。”社论并且指出，致力于实现这些经济计划的人“必须真正关心维护普遍和平”。
    西德的“世界报”也承认，赫鲁晓夫报告中关于苏联发展国民经济的七年计划所规定的任务是现实的。这家报纸写道，在苏联制造的第一个人造卫星和人造“行星”进入了宇宙空间之后，有关苏联威力增长的一切消息都使西方国家认真看待。
    “南德意志报”28日写道：赫鲁晓夫的报告是一幅“具有实力发展与和平意愿的未来，具有经济发展与社会服务的光辉图景”。这家报纸说，苏联“今天在学人数比西欧四个大国的在学人数的总和大三倍，光是这一点就很了不起。所宣布的在今后七年中（工业）生产增长80％是绝对可能的，因为它同过去几年的增长速度是相适应的。”
    意大利“人民报”在评论七年计划时说：“应当无条件地用极其认真的态度来对待这一计划……当1929年斯大林宣布第一个五年计划的时候，大多数国际观察家都不认真地把它当一回事。今天不能再犯同样的错误了”。
    “正义报”认为，“如果西方有谁仍然想否认苏联在工业发展和农业生产方面所取得的巨大成就的话，那么，他就不仅是在否认明显的事实，而且将是甘冒歪曲苏联和西方国家经济力量对比的危险。”
    “瑞士报”指出了，苏联经济计划规定苏联要赶上作为世界上居于首位的工业国家——美国的重要意义，并且指出，这一规定是有基础的。它警告人们不要轻视苏联人民的发明和劳动能力，并且指出，苏联在同美国的竞争中已经在征服空间方面占领先地位。
    许多瑞士报纸还指出，赫鲁晓夫报告是苏联希望和平和希望在最近缓和国际紧张局势的证明。“民族新闻报”写道，“赫鲁晓夫再一次表明他是个和平活动家，他需要和平来实现自己的计划……”。
    瑞士的“洛桑日报”指出，赫鲁晓夫的报告“最清楚不过地表明了：苏联将在和平竞赛方面更加坚定地继续采取行动”。（附图片）
