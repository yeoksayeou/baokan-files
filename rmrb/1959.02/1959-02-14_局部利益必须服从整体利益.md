    Establish the Viewpoint of the Whole Country as a Single Chessboard
    The idea of viewing the whole country as a single chessboard is essential for accelerating socialist construction. Only by establishing this idea and implementing it in every aspect of our work can we promote the high-speed development of the national economy and build socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. In our country, the socialist economic system unites all regions and economic sectors into a unified and organic whole, developing according to the socialist economic laws of our country. Our national system is democratic centralism. To build socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, on the one hand, we must give appropriate autonomy to localities to fully mobilize their initiative and the initiative and enthusiasm of the people. On the other hand, we must strictly maintain the planning and organization of construction throughout the country. The purpose of developing production and carrying out construction in all regions, departments, people's communes, and enterprises is to continuously meet the growing material and cultural needs of all members of society. Their fundamental interests and goals are completely consistent; the only difference lies in the division of labor among different regions and departments. Therefore, under the centralized and unified leadership of the central government, all aspects form a relationship of division of labor, cooperation, mutual promotion, and common upsurge. Reflected in people's thinking, this is the communist idea of viewing the whole country as a single chessboard, with the part subordinate to the whole. This is a manifestation of the great superiority of our socialist political and economic system and conforms to the long-term and fundamental interests of our 650 million people.

    Establishing the viewpoint of the whole country as a single chessboard requires a correct understanding and handling of the relationship between the part and the whole, and between different parts. The whole is composed of all its parts, and the victory on the national economic front is the sum of the victories of various regions and departments. The interests of the whole are higher than the interests of the part. When the whole develops, the part will also develop; conversely, if the whole is not managed well, the part will never be managed well. To grasp the whole, we must concentrate our efforts on seizing the main links that play a decisive role in the whole. Therefore, the role and achievements of the part should not be evaluated solely from the direct effects of the part itself, but mainly from the role it plays in the whole.

    Some comrades lack this idea of viewing the whole country as a single chessboard. They consider themselves to be exerting great effort and striving for advancement, or use this as an excuse to disregard the overall situation of the country or the city. However, there must be a comprehensive and correct understanding of the direction of effort and the meaning of advancement. Exerting great effort and striving for advancement are aimed at achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in national socialist construction. The main criterion for measuring whether a part is striving for advancement is to see what contributions it has made to the greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in national socialist construction, and how much it has contributed. To make more and better contributions, one must first strive for advancement ideologically: destroy capitalist ideology and establish communist ideology; destroy departmentalism and establish a global perspective. Only by striving for advancement ideologically can we continuously leap forward in production and construction. If, during a certain period, the supply of certain materials and the allocation of funds are relatively tight, and a part does not act in accordance with the spirit of the whole country as a single chessboard, or in accordance with the state's overall plan, but instead tries to get as much as possible and reduce the amount allocated to others, can this be considered striving for advancement? Obviously, this kind of thinking does not conform to the spirit of striving for advancement. Striving for advancement means striving to build socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way with a communist spirit. It means fully exerting subjective effort, overcoming difficulties, and creating conditions to strive for advancement. It certainly does not mean squeezing out others or disregarding the overall situation to propel oneself to the forefront.

    Emphasizing the whole country as a single chessboard certainly does not mean that the initiative of the local areas or parts is unnecessary. On the contrary, it is precisely to bring into play the initiative of the entire party and the entire people in a more planned and more leadership-oriented way, and to incorporate all plans into the unified national plan. It is to make the plan accurately reflect the enthusiasm and revolutionary zeal of the entire party and the entire people, and to better bring into play the initiative and flexibility of the localities. The whole and the part, centralization and flexibility, are a unity of opposites, and the dominant aspect is the whole and centralization. Under the unified centralization of the whole, the part can have flexibility, and the flexibility of the part is for better unified centralization of the whole. If it is said that the whole country as a single chessboard and the unified plan restrict any initiative, then it is the initiative that disregards the overall situation and departmentalism, and it will never restrict the communist initiative to resolutely fulfill the state plan.

    However, a few comrades have not seen the essential difference between socialist economy and capitalist economy and individual economy, and have not seen that our socialist country must "turn the entire state economic machinery into one huge machine, into an economic organism in which hundreds of millions of people work according to a single plan" (Lenin). They do not understand that division of labor and cooperation are dialectical relationships. It is impossible for a region or a people's commune to be completely "self-sufficient," or for a department or enterprise to be absolutely "omnipotent." Various regions, departments, people's communes, and enterprises must have a division of labor in production and labor. Where there is a division of labor, there is cooperation, and where there is cooperation, there must be mutual support. They often look at problems only from the perspective of their own region, department, or unit, and only see their own importance, being blinded by a single leaf and unable to see the rest of the forest. They have not realized that "disregarding the overall situation, being indifferent to other departments, other places, and other people, is the characteristic of these departmentalists. For such people, we must increase education to make them understand that this is a tendency towards sectarianism, and if it develops, it is very dangerous." (Mao Zedong: "Rectifying the Party's Style of Work") Some of them are "kind-hearted" and may not be trying to seek welfare for the masses within a small scope, but they have become detached from the masses in the long-term interests of the vast majority of the people. In order to realize a comprehensive leap forward, leading comrades at all levels should take the attitude towards the state plan and socialist cooperation as a major sign of measuring their level of communist consciousness, and overcome various forms of departmentalism and decentralism.

    Be Good at Taking Care of the Overall Situation and Subordinating to the Whole
    The establishment of the people's communes has better consolidated and developed communist large-scale cooperation. Because the degree of collectivization of the people's communes has been further increased and the scale of collectivization has been further expanded, this will inevitably make people's collectivist thinking and the concept of starting from the overall situation further popularized and improved. However, we should understand that overcoming departmentalism is a long-term educational process. We must both see the dominant aspect of the development of people's thinking towards communist large-scale cooperation in the Great Leap Forward, and also see that departmentalist thinking still exists on certain issues at present.

    This kind of departmentalist thinking is essentially a manifestation of the remnants of the private ownership concept of small producers. In recent years, we have changed the private ownership of the means of production of the small-scale peasant economy into the small collective ownership of agricultural cooperatives and even the large collective ownership of the people's communes. The economic foundation of private ownership has been eliminated, but the remnants of the private ownership concept that have permeated people's minds for thousands of years are not so easy to completely eliminate. In a fairly long period of time, it will still appear from time to time, sometimes here and sometimes there, or exist in people's minds in disguise, requiring us to constantly criticize and eliminate it. Especially at a time when the relations of production are undergoing changes and collectivization is making great strides forward, the old system is being destroyed, the new system has not yet been soundly established, and people are not yet accustomed to or even doubt the new system, departmentalist thinking is most likely to manifest itself. Therefore, it is most necessary for us to pay attention to criticizing and overcoming it.

    For those who have departmentalist thinking, we should use the method of education and persuasion to help them improve their understanding and consciously establish an overall perspective. The reason why we should do this is that the fundamental interests between our country and the people's communes, between the people's communes and the production teams, and in short, between the upper and lower levels, and between the whole and the part, are consistent. If all the people's communes can take care of the overall situation and subordinate to the whole, so that the central government can properly arrange the national construction work and promote the economic and cultural construction cause to move forward by leaps and bounds, this is the greatest interest of all the people's communes in the country. Similarly, if all the production teams can take care of the overall situation and subordinate to the whole, so that the people's communes can make overall plans for the production and distribution of the entire commune, develop production at the highest speed, and gradually improve the lives of the members, this is the greatest interest of all the production teams and all the members of the entire commune. The whole country is a single chessboard, and the national economy is an organic whole that cannot be divided. The higher the leading organs, the more they can look far ahead, the larger the overall situation they see, and the greater the facilities that affect our interests. Therefore, the part subordinates to the whole, and the small collective subordinates to the large collective, precisely for the fundamental interests of the part and the small collective. Since there is consistency in fundamental interests, then as long as the truth is explained, those with departmentalist thinking can be educated.

    (Excerpted from "Thought Emancipation" No. 3, 1959, commentary: "Raise Thinking and Overcome Departmentalism.")

    Dig Out the Old Roots of Departmentalism
    "Heavy burden" is what many comrades in charge of communes mean by "the pot is on their heads." We should understand the difficulties of the comrades in charge of the communes in this "heavy burden" and "the pot on their heads." The Party sent them to work in the communes to be responsible for making the production and life of the entire commune better and better. Not admitting this and simply putting big hats of "departmentalism" and "individualism" on the comrades in charge of the communes will not be convincing. However, this cannot be used as a shield for departmentalism and individualism, and continue to develop departmentalism and individualism.

    Is it starting from the 650 million people or from the number of people in this commune? Is it starting from long-term interests or from immediate interests? In other words, how should the "burden" be shouldered? The burden has two ends, one end is the task of the state, and the other end is the task of the commune. When the Party entrusts a comrade to take charge of the Party work in the commune, it means that this comrade must be able to represent both the interests of the state and the interests of the commune. Our Party takes the interests of the state and the people as its interests, and takes the combination of the long-term interests and immediate interests of the working class and the people of the whole country as its interests. The task of the Party is to correctly handle the relationship of interests among the state, the commune, and the members. The first secretary of the commune Party committee must shoulder this "burden."

    Is it shouldering the burden or carrying the baggage? This is not only a question of method, but also a question of thinking.

    "A thousand pounds of burden are shouldered by everyone," this is the valuable experience of the hardworking and brave Chinese people in dealing with the cause of collectivism. It is impossible to shoulder it by oneself, but by relying on everyone. That is to say, all members must come to shoulder this burden. For anyone to shoulder this burden, they must first put down the "baggage," put down the baggage of departmentalism and individualism.

    The struggle between collectivism and departmentalism reflects the contradiction between the large collective and the small collective. The way to solve this contradiction is to communicate ideas and to set rules. Rules can only be set and done when ideas are communicated. Therefore, the most fundamental way is to solve the problem of thinking - to dig out the old roots of departmentalism.

    Some comrades said, "The root of departmentalism is individualism," which is a penetrating statement. Why is the root of departmentalism individualism? It is worth thinking seriously for those who have departmentalist ideas!

### 局部利益必须服从整体利益

    局部利益必须服从整体利益
    树立全国一盘棋的观点
    全国一盘棋是我们加速建设社会主义必须树立的思想。只有树立这种思想，在实际工作中各个环节上贯彻这个思想，才能促使国民经济高速度发展，多快好省地建设社会主义。在我们的国家中，社会主义的经济制度，把全国各个地区、各个经济部门联合成一个统一的有机的整体，按照我国社会主义的经济规律而发展着。我们的国家制度是民主集中制，要多快好省地建设社会主义，一方面要给地方适当的机动权，以便充分发挥地方的积极性，充分发挥人民群众的积极性和主动性；另一方面要严格保持全国范围的建设事业的计划性、组织性。各个地区、各个部门、各个人民公社和各个企业发展生产、进行建设的目的，都是不断地满足全体社会成员经常增长的物质和文化生活的需要。他们的根本利益和目标是完全一致的，只是各个地区各个部门之间分工有所不同而已。因此各个方面，在中央的集中统一领导下，形成了分工协作、相互促进、共同高涨的关系。反映在人们的思想意识中，就是全国一盘棋，小局服从大局的共产主义思想。这是我国社会主义政治和经济制度巨大优越性的表现，符合我国六亿五千万人民长远的根本的利益。
    树立全国一盘棋的观点，就是要求正确地认识和处理局部和全局、局部和局部之间的关系。全局是由它的一切局部构成的，全国经济战线上的胜利是各个地区、部门胜利的总和。全局利益高于局部利益。全局发展了，局部也就会发展；反之，全局办不好，局部也决不会办好。掌握全局就必须集中力量抓住对于全局起决定作用的主要环节。因此，评价局部的作用和成就不能只从我这个局部本身的直接效果来着眼，而主要应该从对全局所起的作用来衡量。
    有些同志缺乏这种全国一盘棋的思想。他们自以为是鼓足干劲、力争上游，或者以此作为借口而不顾全国或全市的全局。但是对干劲的方向，上游的涵义，必须要有一个全面的正确的认识。鼓足干劲、力争上游是为了争取全国社会主义建设更大更好更全面的跃进。衡量一个局部是否力争上游，主要就看它在争取全国社会主义建设更大更好更全面的跃进中作出什么贡献，作了多少贡献；而要作出更多更好的贡献，首先必须在思想上力争上游：破资本主义思想，立共产主义思想；破本位主义，立全局观点。只有在思想上能够力争上游，才能在生产和建设中不断跃进。假如在一定时期内，若干种物资的供应和资金的调度是比较紧张的，作为一个局部，不是根据全国一盘棋的精神，不是按照国家的统盘规划，而是想怎样多争到一些东西，少调出一些东西，能不能算力争上游呢？显然这种思想是不符合力争上游的精神的。力争上游，是力争以共产主义精神多快好省地建设社会主义的上游，是要充分经过主观努力、克服困难、创造条件来力争上游。决不是挤掉别人、不顾全局而把自己送到上游去。
    强调全国一盘棋，当然不是不要地方的、局部的积极性。相反，这正是为了更有计划、更有领导地发挥全党全民的积极性，把所有的计划都纳入全国的统一计划之内，就是要使计划准确地反映全党全民的积极性和革命干劲。也就是为了更好地发挥地方的积极性和机动性。全局和局部、集中和机动，都是对立的统一，而主导的一面是全局和集中，在全局的统一集中之下，局部可以有机动，局部的机动是为了全面更好的统一集中。如果说全国一盘棋，统一的计划限制了什么积极性，那就是限制了不顾大局和本位主义，而绝不会限制坚决完成国家计划的共产主义的积极性。
    但是，有少数同志没有看到社会主义经济和资本主义经济、个体经济具有本质上的区别，没有看到我们社会主义国家必须“把全部国家经济机构变成一整架大机器，变成一个使几万万人都遵照一个计划工作的经济机体”（列宁），他们不了解分工和协作是辩证的关系，一个地区或人民公社要完全“自给自足”，一个部门或企业要绝对“全能”是不可能的。各个地区、部门、人民公社和企业，在生产劳动中总要有一个分工，有分工就有协作，有协作就要相互支援。他们往往只从本地区、部门、单位的角度来看问题，只看到本身的重要性，一叶障目，不及其余。没有认识到“不顾大局，对别部、别地、别人漠不关心，就是这种本位主义者的特点。对于这样的人，必须加重教育，使他们懂得这就是一种宗派主义的倾向，如果发展下去，是很危险的。”（毛泽东：“整顿党的作风”）他们中间有的人是“好心肠”，未尝不是想为小范围内的群众谋福利，然而在绝大多数人民的长远利益上脱离了人民群众。为了实现全面的大跃进，各级领导同志应该把对待国家计划和社会主义协作的态度作为衡量自己共产主义觉悟程度的一个主要标志，克服各种形形色色的本位主义、分散主义的倾向。
      （摘自“解放”第三期，刘建洲：“论全国一盘棋”。）
    要善于照顾全局服从整体
    人民公社的建立，使共产主义大协作得到更好的巩固和发展。由于人民公社集体化的程度更加提高，集体化的规模更加扩大，这就必然会使人们的集体主义思想和从全局整体出发的观念，更进一步地普及和提高。但是，我们应该懂得，克服本位主义思想，是一个长期的教育过程。我们既要看到大跃进中人们的思想在向着共产主义大协作发展这个主导的方面，同时也要看到目前在某些问题上还存在着本位主义思想。
    这种本位主义思想，实质上是小生产者私有观念残余的一种表现。在这几年来，我们已经把小农经济的生产资料私有制改变成为农业社的小集体所有制以至人民公社的大集体所有制，私有制的经济基础消灭了，可是，几千年来浸染着人们思想的私有观念残余却并不那么容易彻底消灭，在相当长的时期内，它还会时隐时现，此隐彼现，或者改头换面地存在人们的头脑中，需要我们不断地去进行批判和破除。特别是在生产关系发生变革，集体化大大前进一步的关头，旧的制度被破坏了，新的制度一时还没有健全起来，人们对新的制度也还不够习惯，或者还有怀疑，在这种时候，本位主义思想最容易表现出来，因此，也最需要我们去注意批判克服。
    对于存在本位主义思想的人，应该通过教育说服的方法，帮助他们提高认识，自觉地树立整体观点。我们所以应该这样做，是因为我们的国家同人民公社之间、人民公社同生产队之间……，总之，上下之间、整体同部分之间，其根本利益是一致的。各个人民公社都能照顾全局，服从整体，使中央能够对全国的建设工作妥善安排，推动经济文化建设事业一日千里地向前发展，这就是全国所有的人民公社的最大利益；同样，各个生产队都能照顾全局，服从整体，使人民公社能够对全社的生产和分配作统筹规划，以最高速度发展生产，逐步改善社员生活，这就是全社所有生产队所有社员的最大利益。全国一盘棋，全国经济是一个有机的整体，不可分割。愈是高级的领导机关，愈能高瞻远瞩，看到的全局也愈大，其设施关涉我们的利益也愈大，所以部分服从整体，小集体服从大集体，也正是为了部分和小集体的根本利益着想。既然有着根本利益的一致，那么，只要把道理说通，有本位主义思想的人是可以被教育过来的。
    （摘自“思想解放”1959年第三期评论：“提高思想克服本位主义”。）
    挖掉本位主义的老根子
      “担子重”，就是许多在公社负责的同志所说“锅顶到自己头上”的意思。应当体谅公社负责同志的这种“担子重”，“锅顶在头上”的苦衷。党派他们到公社去做工作，就是要他们负责把全公社的生产、生活越搞越好。不承认这一点，光是给公社的负责同志扣上“本位主义”、“个人主义”的大帽子，是不能令人心悦诚服的。但是，也不能以此作为本位主义、个人主义的护身符，而继续发展本位主义和个人主义。
    是从六亿五千万人出发，还是从本公社的多少人出发？是从长远利益出发，还是从眼前利益出发？也就是说，“担子”如何挑法？担子有两头，一头是国家的任务，一头是公社的任务。党委托一位同志去担任公社党的负责工作的时候，这就意味着，要这位同志既能代表国家的利益，又能代表公社的利益。我们的党是以国家和人民的利益为利益的，是以工人阶级和全国人民的长远利益和眼前利益的结合为利益的，党的任务，就是要正确地处理国家、公社和社员三者之间的利益关系。公社党委第一书记要把这个“担子”挑起来。
    是挑担子，还是背包袱？这不仅是一个方法问题，也是一个思想问题。
      “千斤担子众人挑”，这是勤劳而勇敢的我国人民对待集体主义事业的宝贵经验。光靠自己是挑不起的，要靠众人。这就是说，要全体社员都来挑这个担子。而对于任何人来说，要挑起这个担子，必先放下“包袱”，放下本位主义和个人主义的包袱。
    集体主义和本位主义这两种思想的斗争，反映了大集体和小集体的矛盾。解决这个矛盾的办法，一个是通思想，一个是定规矩。规矩也是要思想通了才能定得出，做得到。因此，最根本的办法，还是解决思想问题——挖掉本位主义的老根子。
    有的同志说，“本位主义的根子是个人主义”，这是一针见血的说法。为什么本位主义的根子是个人主义？值得有本位主义思想的人，严肃地想一想！
