Handicraft Cooperative Directors Discuss Current Tasks
Transition to Factories, Revolutionary Technology

    (By our newspaper) The All-China Handicraft Cooperative recently held a symposium in Beijing for directors of handicraft federations in the Northeast and North China regions, focusing on the transition of handicraft cooperatives to factories and technological revolution.

    The meeting considered that the high tide of socialist transformation in 1956 basically completed the great transformation of handicrafts from individual to collective ownership in terms of means of production; in 1958, with the overall Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, handicraft cooperatives "ascended to a higher level," and a high tide of transition to factories emerged, with most areas basically completing the task of transitioning from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people. According to statistics from the six provinces, cities, and autonomous regions of Beijing, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia, the number of cooperative (group) members who have already transitioned to factories accounts for 80% of the total number of cooperative (group) members in these areas; among them, the number transitioning to state-owned factories accounts for 35%, those transitioning to cooperative factories account for 33%, and those transferred to people's communes account for 12%. In areas with faster progress, such as Tianjin, the number of cooperative (group) members who have transitioned to factories accounts for 98% of the total number of cooperative (group) members, and Hebei (excluding Tianjin) accounts for 90%.

    The meeting held that the transition of handicraft cooperatives to ownership by the whole people is the inevitable result of China's economic and political development and the inevitable development law of the socialist transformation of handicrafts. Facts have proven that after the transition of handicraft cooperatives to factories, the new relations of production adapt to the development of productive forces, resolve the contradictions that collective ownership could not solve, and a thriving new atmosphere has emerged. For example, after the Tianjin No. 1 Machine Tool Factory transitioned to a factory, it successfully trial-produced a hydraulic gantry planer with more than 200 precision parts, and products such as the Soviet-style 616 high-speed lathe. Before the Changchun Steel Rolling Factory in Jilin Province transitioned to a factory, the average monthly output value was 216,000 yuan, with the highest month being 260,000 yuan; after the transition to a factory, it completed 600,000 yuan in less than a month.

    The meeting pointed out that many units and members who have not yet transitioned to factories are also actively demanding transition, which is already a "ripe fruit" situation. Areas with slower progress in transitioning to factories should seize this work. The meeting also pointed out that in the process of transitioning to factories and transferring to people's communes, federations at all levels must adopt a responsible attitude to ensure a good transition and handover.

    The meeting also studied the issue of technological revolution in handicrafts. In 1958, handicraft cooperatives in various regions launched a mass technological revolution movement centered on improving tools and trial-producing new products, and the level of mechanization has significantly improved. The meeting believes that in 1959, relevant departments at all levels should convene on-site meetings by specialty, summarize and promote advanced experiences, and help grassroots production units solve specific difficulties, striving to achieve greater victories in the technological revolution.

    The meeting also discussed summarizing the work of socialist transformation of handicrafts over the past ten years, the organizational structure and tasks of federations at all levels after the transition of handicraft cooperatives to factories, and other issues.

### 手工业联社主任座谈当前任务  转厂过渡　革新技术

    手工业联社主任座谈当前任务
    转厂过渡　革新技术
    本报讯　中华全国手工业合作总社最近在北京召开了东北、华北地区手工业联社主任座谈会，着重研究了手工业合作社转厂过渡工作、技术革命等问题。
    会议认为，1956年的社会主义改造高潮，使手工业在生产资料所有制方面基本上完成了由个体到集体的伟大转变；1958年随着社会主义建设事业的全面大跃进，手工业合作社又“更上一层楼”，出现了转厂过渡高潮，大部分地区已经基本上实现了由集体所有制向全民所有制过渡的任务。据北京、河北、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、内蒙古六个省、市、自治区的统计，已经转厂过渡的社（组）员，占这些地区社（组）员总数的80％；其中过渡为国营工厂的人数占35％，转为合作工厂的占33％，下放人民公社的占12％。进度较快的地区，如天津市，已转厂的社（组）员占社（组）员总数的98％，河北（不包括天津）占90％。
    会议认为，手工业合作社向全民所有制过渡，是我国经济和政治发展的必然结果，也是手工业社会主义改造必然的发展规律。事实证明，手工业合作社转厂过渡以后，由于新的生产关系适应了生产力的发展，解决了集体所有制不能解决的矛盾，出现了一片欣欣向荣的新气象。如天津市第一机床厂转厂以后，试制成功了有二百多个精密零件的液压龙门刨，仿苏616式高速车床等产品。吉林省长春市轧钢厂转厂以前，平均月产值是二十一万六千元，最高月份为二十六万元，转厂以后不到一个月就完成了六十万元。
    会议指出，很多目前还没有转厂的单位、社员们也积极要求转厂，已是“瓜熟蒂落”的形势。转厂进度较慢的地区，应当抓紧这一工作。会议还指出，在转厂和下放人民公社的过程中，各级联社必须采取认真负责的态度，保证转好、交好。
    会议还研究了手工业技术革命的问题。1958年，各地手工业合作社开展了以改进工具和试制新产品为中心的群众性技术革命运动，机械化水平有了显著的提高。会议认为，1959年各级有关部门应该按专业召开一些现场会议，总结和推广先进经验，并且帮助基层生产单位解决具体困难，力争在技术革命方面取得更大的胜利。
    会议还讨论了总结十年手工业社会主义改造工作、手工业社转厂过渡后各级联社的机构设置和任务等问题。
