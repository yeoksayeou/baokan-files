Chongqing, February 24 (This newspaper dispatch) - Chongqing Iron and Steel Company is taking measures in many aspects, such as strengthening political and ideological work, implementing "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations," launching vigorous mass movements, and carrying out technical revolution, to ensure that steel production doubles this year. Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has already formulated a leap forward plan for this year's production, ensuring that steel production reaches 820,000 tons and striving to complete 950,000 tons, an increase of 90.6% to 120% compared to last year; other steel materials and pig iron will also increase by more than 55.5% to 100% compared to last year. At the same time, the quality of steel will also be further improved on the basis of last year.

To ensure the completion of this year's production leap forward plan, the company strengthened the leadership of the Party and first grasped political and ideological work. The company's Party committee convened a three-level cadre meeting, combined with the discussion and implementation of the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and launched a debate among cadres on two different attitudes towards this year's leap forward plan: "Is it better to continue to exert great effort, carry forward the spirit of hard work, and win a greater leap forward victory this year, or is it better to covet ease and attempt to complete this year's plan easily?" Through airing views and debates, everyone conscientiously summarized the experience and achievements of last year's Great Leap Forward, carefully analyzed the favorable conditions for this year's production, and eliminated the right-leaning conservative thinking of a few people who, due to insufficient understanding, emphasized difficulties and advocated setting the targets lower in an attempt to complete the plan easily, and established the idea of a greater and more comprehensive leap forward. Everyone unanimously agreed that this year's early and tight grasp has created favorable conditions for completing this year's task. Production difficulties, such as the high sulfur content of local iron and insufficient supply of equipment and raw materials, are also being overcome and can be completely overcome; thus, further enhancing the confidence and determination to complete this year's leap forward plan.

While launching cadres to discuss this year's leap forward targets and unify ideological understanding, the company's Party committee and administrative leaders also initiated a vigorous mass movement among the vast number of employees to discuss leap forward targets, propose measures, and offer advice. The leap forward targets proposed by the masses when tapping production potential greatly exceeded the plan put forward at the three-level cadre meeting; at the same time, thousands of concrete measures to achieve the plan were put forward, which not only enabled the various measures originally proposed by the leadership to be grasped by the masses, but also further enriched the content of the original measures.

On the basis of strengthening political and ideological work, the company's Party committee and administrative leaders further conscientiously implemented the "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations" enterprise constitution, and launched employees to carry out a technical revolution to address key production issues. The company has organized eight working groups, led by leading cadres, to go deep into the workshops to "cultivate experimental plots" and solve key production issues. The Party committee has decided that every Wednesday and Friday will be "no meeting days," and cadres will go to the workshops to work with the workers on this day. The factory's planning, technology, etc. have also been determined to be decentralized and managed with the participation of workers. The company further changed the phenomenon of overlapping institutions in its affiliated factories, stipulating that all section, office, and department-level organizational structures that have already been established should be abolished; those that have not been established should not be established, so as to facilitate cadres to better approach the masses and production reality.

The primary key to Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's production is to solve the desulfurization problem of local iron for steelmaking. After the company's Party committee launched a technical revolution movement among employees and engineers, the pig iron furnace has been changed to an alkaline hot blast pig iron furnace, and a "one-dragon" desulfurization operation method has been adopted. From the entry of pig iron into the factory and into the furnace, a series of processes are carried out with multiple encirclements and batch sweeps to prevent sulfur from passing the barrier. The desulfurization effect is very good after adopting these methods. Now the company's Party committee has decided to convert all pig iron furnaces to alkaline hot blast pig iron furnaces within February to turn local iron into good steel.

Employees also increased production by fully tapping the potential of existing equipment and finding ways to add some equipment themselves. The open-hearth steelmaking plant mainly adopts the method of loading more, smelting quickly, and protecting the furnace, shortening the smelting time and increasing steel production. Employees of the ironmaking plant have recently proposed 20 major technical measures, including building two small, indigenous high furnaces by themselves to solve the problem of smelting ferromanganese. The masses of the large rolling mill launched a technical revolution, adopting water-cooled furnace bodies for the gas furnaces, increasing wind pressure, and using hot air, so that one gas furnace becomes two and two becomes three to meet the needs of rolling steel production. During the current overhaul, employees also tried to shorten the overhaul time as much as possible so that the rolling mill could be put into production as soon as possible.

Currently, all employees of the company are carrying out a vigorous high-yield, high-quality competition movement, and the daily output of steel is rising steadily, and the quality has also improved. The refractory material factory has seen an unprecedented new atmosphere in recent days, creating more than 40 new records. Recently, it took only 39 hours and 40 minutes to burn a kiln of alumina-magnesia bricks, which is more than seven hours shorter than the previous highest record. (Attached picture)

### 广泛发动群众提措施、献计策、挖潜力  重钢力争钢铁产量加番

    广泛发动群众提措施、献计策、挖潜力
    重钢力争钢铁产量加番
    本报重庆24日电　重庆钢铁公司从加强政治思想工作、贯彻“两参一改三结合”、大搞群众运动、大闹技术革命等多方面采取措施，为保证今年钢的产量翻一番。重庆钢铁公司已经订出今年生产跃进计划，确保钢的产量达到八十二万吨，力争完成九十五万吨，比去年增加90.6％到120％；其他钢材、生铁也要比去年增长55.5％到100％以上。同时钢铁质量也要在去年的基础上进一步提高。
    为了保证完成今年生产跃进计划，这个公司加强了党的领导，首先抓紧政治思想工作。公司党委召开了三级干部会议，结合讨论、贯彻八届六中全会精神，针对干部中对待今年跃进计划两种不同的态度，发动大家辩论：“是继续鼓足干劲、发扬苦干精神夺取今年更大跃进的胜利好呢，还是贪图轻松、企图轻而易举地完成今年计划？”通过鸣放、辩论，大家认真总结了去年大跃进的经验和成绩，仔细分析了今年生产上的有利条件，破除了少数人由于认识不足，因而强调困难，主张把指标订低点，企图轻松完成计划的右倾保守思想，树立了更大更全面跃进的思想。大家一致认为：今年抓得早，抓得紧，已为完成今年任务创造了有利条件。生产中的困难，如土铁硫分高、设备和原材料供应不足等，也是正被克服和完全能够克服的；因而进一步增强了完成今年跃进计划的信心和决心。
    与发动干部讨论今年跃进指标、统一思想认识的同时，公司党委和行政领导还在广大职工中发起了轰轰烈烈的讨论跃进指标、提措施、献计策的群众运动。群众在挖掘生产潜力时提出的跃进指标，都大大超过了三级干部会议上所提出的计划；同时还提出了成千上万件实现计划的具体措施，既使原来领导上所提出的各项措施为群众所掌握，同时又更加充实了原订各项措施的内容。
    在加强政治思想工作的基础上，公司党委和行政领导进一步认真贯彻“两参一改三结合”的企业宪法，针对生产上的关键问题，发动职工大闹技术革命。全公司已组织了八个工作组，由领导干部带队分别深入各车间“种试验田”，解决生产关键。党委已经确定每星期三、五为“无会议日”，干部在这一天都下车间和工人一起劳动。厂里的计划、技术等也确定下放由工人参加管理。公司进一步改变了所属各厂机构重叠的现象，规定凡是已经设立科、室和部一级组织机构的一律撤销；没有设立科、室、部的一律不设，以便利干部能够更好地接近群众和生产实际。
    重庆钢铁公司生产上存在的首要关键，是解决土铁炼钢的脱硫问题。公司党委发动职工和工程技术人员开展技术革命运动以后，已将化铁炉改为碱性热风化铁炉，并采取“一条龙”的脱硫操作方法，从生铁进厂、入炉等一系列过程，作到重重包围，分批扫荡，不许硫磺过关。采用这些方法以后，脱硫效果很好。现在公司党委已决定要在2月份内将全部化铁炉改为碱性热风化铁炉，使土铁炼成好钢。
    职工们还从充分挖掘现有设备潜力，自己设法增添一部分设备等办法，增加产量。平炉炼钢厂主要采用多装快炼护好炉的方法，缩短冶炼时间，增加钢的产量。炼铁厂职工最近已提出二十项重大的技术措施。其中包括自己动手建成两个土洋结合的小高炉，解决炼锰铁的问题。大型轧钢厂群众大闹技术革命，将煤气炉采用水冷炉身，提高风压，用热风，使煤气炉一变两、两变三，以适应轧钢生产的需要。在当前检修中，职工们也设法尽量缩短检修时间，使轧钢机早日投入生产。
    目前全公司职工正开展一个轰轰烈烈的高产、高质的竞赛运动，钢的日产量节节上升，质量也有提高。耐火材料厂在最近几天中，出现了前所未有的新气象，创造了四十多次新纪录，最近只用三十九小时四十分钟就烧好一窑铝镁砖，比以往创造的最高纪录还缩短了七小时多。（附图片）
    新疆八一钢铁厂各族职工在党委领导下，展开了劳动竞赛和共产主义协作，力争超额完成跃进指标。新建成的六十五立方公尺的高炉，厂房还没有盖起，就开始生产了。本报记者　李义芳摄
