Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 18th: TASS reported from Moscow on February 18th that the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, said in Tula on February 17th that the international status of the Soviet Union has been consolidated as never before. He said that if we continue to implement our domestic policies so smoothly—our achievements now amaze the whole world—then the international prestige of the Soviet Union will be even greater.

Khrushchev made these remarks at a rally celebrating the award of the Order of Lenin to the Tula Oblast for its achievements in agriculture. In this speech, he touched on some issues regarding the international situation.

Referring to the Soviet Union's proposals on the Berlin issue and the reaction to the draft peace treaty with Germany in the West, Khrushchev pointed out that international issues cannot be resolved by force now. A war using modern weapons would bring huge sacrifices and destruction to all countries, regardless of their geographical location. This would be a great disaster for mankind. We understand this very clearly, so we say, let us sign a peace treaty.

Khrushchev then pointed out that some leaders in Western countries say that even if the Soviet Union transfers all its rights regarding the Berlin issue, obtained under the Four-Power Agreement (Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France), to the German Democratic Republic, Western countries will not recognize this transfer. Khrushchev said that in response to this, one can say: "Gentlemen, it is up to you to recognize it or not, but the German Democratic Republic will not cease to exist because of this."

Khrushchev said that some warmongers in Western countries say that if the control of access to West Berlin is transferred to the German Democratic Republic, they will rely on force to break into West Berlin. Khrushchev said in response to this that only those who do not consider the real situation would make such an assertion. Everyone knows that Soviet troops are stationed in the German Democratic Republic. They are not there for fun. Someone is threatening us that if we block them, they will start shooting. But everyone understands that if someone starts shooting, it means the beginning of a war. We advise those who attempt to brandish swords and guns, if your heads are heated, please take a cold shower and calm your nerves. Otherwise, this will endanger peace.

Khrushchev pointed out that some Westerners say that if land routes to West Berlin are closed, they will build an "air bridge." This argument is untenable. He said, understand that if a peace treaty is concluded with the two Germanies or one of them (and the Soviet Union and other countries that fought against Hitler's Germany are prepared to conclude such a treaty), then the German Democratic Republic will have all the rights and obligations of a sovereign state. These rights will be guaranteed by international law. Khrushchev emphasized that therefore, any infringement on the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic, whether it comes from the sea, land, or air, will be counterattacked without fail. The imperialist gentlemen should consider all this.

Khrushchev said that some people accuse us of being the source of the "Cold War." He said, who is actually launching the "Cold War"? Is it those who propose ending the "Cold War" state, signing a peace treaty with Germany, suggesting turning West Berlin from a source of unrest into a demilitarized free city, and proposing establishing normal peaceful relations so that each country can develop according to its own will, or is it those who want to prolong the "Cold War" state in order to prepare for a new world war to achieve their aggressive purposes? Khrushchev continued, "These things cannot scare us. We do not want to fight, nor do we intend to cross the borders of other countries. However, if anyone dares to infringe upon our borders or the borders of our allies, then we cannot ignore it. If anyone dares to infringe upon these borders and use force to achieve their aggressive purposes, then they will suffer a devastating blow."

Khrushchev pointed out that some Westerners also have a sober assessment of the situation. In this regard, he mentioned the recent remarks by U.S. Senator Mansfield, who talked about his views on how to end the state of war with Germany. Khrushchev said that we believe his suggestions are worthy of attention. Agreements can be reached with these people who are in a more sober state.

Referring to the upcoming visit of Macmillan to the Soviet Union in his speech, Khrushchev pointed out that we are very willing to receive the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary. Our people are hospitable. If the British come to us with sincerity, wanting to reach an agreement with us and improve the relations between our two countries and between the East and the West, then we on our part will facilitate everything that contributes to the consolidation of world peace.

Khrushchev finally talked about relations with Iran. He said that when the Iranian government suggested that we conclude a treaty of friendship and non-aggression, we sent our delegation. Now we understand that as a result of pressure from the United States, Britain, and Turkey, the King of Iran has abandoned his own proposal to conclude a treaty and has decided to conclude a bilateral military treaty with the United States that will make Iran a U.S. military base. At the same time, the King of Iran said that there is some threat to Iran from the Soviet Union. Khrushchev emphasized that this statement is completely unfounded. We have been neighbors for many years, and throughout this period, the Soviet Union has never been accused of taking an unfriendly attitude towards its neighbors. On the contrary, in recent years, we have resolved many past disputes between our two countries through negotiations.

Khrushchev said, who is the King of Iran really afraid of? He is not afraid of us, but of his own people. It seems that he does not believe that his throne is stable, so he does not keep his personal assets in Iran, but in Britain. What happened in Iraq makes him very uneasy.

Khrushchev said that the King of Iran is most afraid of his own people, so he wants to sign a bilateral military treaty with the United States so that the U.S. military can protect his throne, and presents this as: the King seems to want to protect Iran's security from Soviet aggression. Only the naive and ignorant will believe this statement.

Khrushchev said that we will do our best to ensure that the Iranian people correctly understand our position. We do not want the hardworking Iranian people to suffer any misfortune. Of course, we will expose the policies that bring losses to our two peoples, to the Soviet people of all nationalities and the Iranian people.

    赫鲁晓夫谈国际问题
    对社会主义国家的任何侵犯必遭反击
    西方国家应签订对德和约休想靠武力解决德国问题
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科18日讯：苏联部长会议主席、苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫17日在图拉说，苏联的国际地位已经得到了空前的巩固。他说，假如今后我们这样顺利地执行我们的国内政策——现在我们的成就简直使全世界震惊——那末苏联的国际威信将有更大的提高。
    赫鲁晓夫是在一个庆祝图拉州因农业方面的成就而荣获列宁勋章的大会上讲这番话的。他在这次讲话中谈到了关于国际局势的一些问题。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到苏联关于柏林问题的建议以及对德和约草案在西方引起的反应时指出，现在不能用武力来解决国际问题。使用现代化武器的战争能给一切国家带来巨大的牺牲和破坏，不论它们的地理位置如何。这对人类来说会是巨大的灾难。我们对这一点了解得十分清楚，所以我们说，让我们签订和约吧。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，西方国家某些领导人说，即使苏联把它根据英、美、苏、法四国签订的关于柏林问题的各项协定而取得的全部权利移交给德意志民主共和国，西方国家也不会承认这种移交。赫鲁晓夫说，对于这一点，可以这样来回答：“先生们，承认或不承认由你们，可是德意志民主共和国决不会因此而不存在。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，西方国家某些战争狂人说，如果把进入西柏林的管制权移交给德意志民主共和国，他们就要依靠武力冲进西柏林。赫鲁晓夫在回答这一点时说，只有那些不考虑现实情况的人才能作出这样的论断。大家知道，在德意志民主共和国驻有苏联军队。他们并不是呆在那里玩的。有人恫吓我们说，如果我们阻挡，他们就要放枪。但是谁都明白，如果有谁开始放枪，那就意味着开始战争。我们忠告那些企图挥弄刀枪的人，如果你们头脑发热，那么请洗个冷水澡，镇静一下神经。否则这将危及和平。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，某些西方人士说，如果封闭陆地上通向西柏林的道路，他们将建起“空中桥梁”，这种论调是站不住脚的。他说，要知道，如果同两个德国或其中之一缔结和约，（而苏联和其他曾经同希特勒德国作过战的国家是准备缔结这种条约的），那么德意志民主共和国就具有一个主权国家的一切权利和义务。这些权利将得到国际法的保障。赫鲁晓夫强调说，因此，对德意志民主共和国主权的任何侵犯，不论这种侵犯是来自水上、陆地或空中，都会得到不折不扣的反击。帝国主义者先生们应当考虑到这一切。
    赫鲁晓夫说，有人责备我们，说我们是“冷战”的根源。他说，实际上究竟是谁在发动“冷战”呢？是建议停止“冷战”状态、签订对德和约，建议把西柏林从不安的策源地变为非军事化的自由城市，建议建立正常的和平关系，以便使每个国家都能按照自己的意志发展的人呢，还是想要拖延“冷战”状态，以便准备新的世界大战，以达到自己的侵略目的的人呢？赫鲁晓夫接着说：“这些是吓不倒我们的。我们不愿打仗，也不打算越过其他国家的国境。但是，假如谁敢侵犯我们的国境，或者我们的盟国的国境，那末，我们决不能置之不理。如果谁敢侵犯这些国境，用武力来达到自己的侵略目的，那末，他必将遭到毁灭性的打击。”
    赫鲁晓夫指出，西方人士中也有些人对时局的估计是清醒的。在这方面他提到了美国参议员曼斯菲尔德不久前的谈话，曼斯菲尔德谈到了他对如何结束对德战争状态的看法。赫鲁晓夫说，我们认为他的建议是值得重视的。同这些处于比较清醒状态的人是可以达成协议的。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中谈到麦克米伦即将访问苏联的问题时指出，我们很愿意接待英国首相和外交大臣。我们的人民是好客的。如果英国人怀着真心诚意到我们这里来想同我们达成协议和改善我们两国的关系以及东西方之间的关系，那末，我们这一方面就将促成一切有助于巩固世界和平的事情。
    赫鲁晓夫最后谈到了同伊朗的关系。他说，当伊朗政府向我们建议缔结友好和互不侵犯条约时，我们就派去了自己的代表团。现在我们明白了，由于美国、英国和土耳其施加压力的结果，伊朗国王放弃了他自己关于缔结条约的建议，并决定同美国缔结将使伊朗成为美国的军事基地的双边军事条约。同时伊朗国王却说，存在着苏联对伊朗的某种威胁。赫鲁晓夫强调说，这种说法是丝毫没有根据的。我们相邻多年，在整个这一时期里，苏联从来没有什么地方可以被人指责它对邻国采取不友好的态度。相反地，在最近几年来，我们通过谈判的方法解决了许多我们两国之间过去存在的争执问题。
    赫鲁晓夫说，伊朗国王真正惧怕的是谁呢？他怕的不是我们，而是本国的人民。看来，他并不相信自己王位是稳固的，所以他把自己的私人资财不放在伊朗，而放在英国。在伊拉克所发生的事情使他深感不安。
    赫鲁晓夫说，伊朗国王最怕的是本国人民，所以想同美国签订双边军事条约以便让美国军队保护他的王位，而把这件事说成是：国王似乎在想保护伊朗的安全，免受苏联侵犯。这种说法只有幼稚无知的人才会相信。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们将尽力使伊朗人民正确地了解我们的立场。我们不希望勤劳的伊朗人民遭到任何不幸。当然，我们将揭穿那种给我们两国人民，给苏联各族人民和伊朗人民带来损失的政策。
