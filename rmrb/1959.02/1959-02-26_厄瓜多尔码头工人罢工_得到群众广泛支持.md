Xinhua News Agency, Quito, February 25th: The strike of eight hundred dockworkers in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest port, continues to persist. The strike has garnered support from workers in other industries and students.

It is reported that students from the capital's law school held a demonstration on the 23rd in support of the dockworkers' strike. Prior to this, four thousand workers in Guayaquil from domestic and American and British companies involved in petroleum, banana, beer, electricity, and vegetable oil industries also went on strike in support of the dockworkers' demands for wage increases and to protest the government's dismissal of workers. With nearly five thousand workers now involved in the strike, most of the port's activities have come to a standstill.
