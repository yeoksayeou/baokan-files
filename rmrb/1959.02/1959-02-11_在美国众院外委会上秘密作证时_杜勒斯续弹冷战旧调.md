Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Washington: U.S. sources released on the 8th the testimony of Secretary of State Dulles at a closed-door session of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on January 28th. In this redacted testimony, Dulles discussed issues such as Berlin, as well as the Chinese coastal islands of Jinmen (Quemoy) and Mazu (Matsu). In his testimony, Dulles continued to play the old role of a “Cold War” architect, trying to spread suspicion and escalate international tensions.

When discussing the Berlin issue, Dulles emphasized its importance to Western countries. He said, "If Berlin were to be handed over to Communist control, it would probably lead to the disintegration of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." He used war to intimidate world public opinion, insisting that the Berlin issue harbored the danger of war, and that Western countries "would rather risk war than be forced to leave Berlin."

Dulles described West Berlin, an outpost for subversive activities against socialist countries and a hotbed of unrest and conflict, as "the most effective example of freedom." Dulles said: "Berlin is a place that is visible to all in the Soviet Communist world; I think it can be said that it is one of the most touching and obvious examples of freedom." He called on the West to "persist" there. Dulles wanted to use the "Berlin issue" to prove that the Soviet Union was carrying out "aggression" and creating tensions, but this testimony shows that it is the United States itself that is carrying out aggression and creating tensions.

When discussing the "Rapacki Plan" (Poland's plan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe), which would help create an atmosphere of trust in Europe, Dulles said, "This plan in its current form is extremely unfavorable to the West from a military point of view." A large portion of Dulles's comments on the "Rapacki Plan" was deleted by the censors.

When discussing the powerful development of the Soviet Union, Dulles expressed a sense of helplessness, admitting that the United States "has no way to stop Russia's remarkable industrial development. It seems to me that there is no way to prevent the Soviet Union from becoming an increasingly powerful economic and military power." However, Dulles distorted the truth again, trying to make it seem as if the power of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp was not to consolidate peace, but to... "realize the world's communist ambitions and attempt to establish domination over the whole world..."

When discussing the Chinese coastal islands of Jinmen and Mazu, Democrat Chester Bowles, a Congressman from Connecticut, pointed out to Dulles: "For a long time, many of us have had serious doubts about whether it is wise for us to stay there (Jinmen and Mazu) in the first place." He asked Dulles "what action he intends to take, what action he can take, to defuse what many of us consider to be an unrealistic and dangerous situation that could lead to a large-scale war."

Dulles's answer to this question revealed the dilemma the United States faces in the Taiwan Straits, with the noose tightening around its neck. He indicated that he would continue to pressure Chiang Kai-shek to withdraw from Jinmen and Mazu, so that the United States could arbitrarily manipulate the Chiang Kai-shek clique to realize its long-term plot to occupy China's territory of Taiwan and create "two Chinas," but also indicated that it was currently impossible to do so, fearing that such action would exacerbate Chiang Kai-shek's anti-American sentiment and cause "a great deal of harm" to the United States.

Dulles said that he "does not know of any way... to dismantle the Jinmen and Mazu positions." He said that doing so would be the United States "threatening Chiang Kai-shek," which would alienate the United States "from the authorities in Formosa (Taiwan) and arouse their hostility. In that case, they would not be our friends and allies as they are now, but would become violently anti-American."

Dulles said that some people say that the situation would be much better without the Jinmen and Mazu issue. He said, but, "in dealing with the practical problem of how to drive our friends out of this place without causing a great deal of harm, I have not found a way to do so."

Dulles said, "Obviously, Jinmen and Mazu are not easily defended areas." He said, "They (Chiang Kai-shek elements) did withdraw from Dachen... It would be good if they had the same view of Jinmen and Mazu."

In his testimony, Dulles also revealed that the United States is painstakingly trying to break into Africa in order to replace the declining imperialist countries of Western Europe there. He asked Congress to "provide more money" to "develop" U.S. relations with African countries, and said that the United States "is training and equipping officials and staff to go there." He kept in mind the "Cold War," saying that the "Cold War" between the West and international communism "is the effort by both sides to win the hearts of millions of people in the underdeveloped areas of the world—the Middle East and Africa."

### 在美国众院外委会上秘密作证时  杜勒斯续弹冷战旧调

    在美国众院外委会上秘密作证时
    杜勒斯续弹冷战旧调
    新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：美国有关方面8日公布了国务卿杜勒斯1月28日在众议院外交委员会秘密会议上的证词。在这篇经过删节的证词中，杜勒斯谈到了柏林以及中国沿海岛屿金门和马祖等问题。杜勒斯在作证中仍然扮演他的“冷战”策划者的老角色，设法散布怀疑，加剧国际紧张局势。
    在谈到柏林问题时，杜勒斯强调这个问题对西方国家的重要性。他说，“如果把柏林交给共产党控制，那就大概会使北大西洋公约组织瓦解”。他用战争来恫吓世界舆论，硬说柏林问题孕育着战争的危险，西方国家“宁肯冒战争的危险，也不愿被迫离开柏林”。
    杜勒斯把西柏林这个对社会主义国家进行颠复活动的前哨基地以及不安和冲突的温床说成是“自由的最有效的榜样。”杜勒斯说：“柏林是在苏联共产主义世界中人所共睹的地方；我认为可以说，这是自由的最动人的和明显的榜样之一。”他号召西方要在这里“坚持”下去。杜勒斯想利用“柏林问题”证明苏联进行“侵略”和制造紧张局势，但是，他的这段证词表明，进行侵略和制造紧张局势的正是美国自己。
    在谈到有助于在欧洲造成信任局面的“腊帕茨基计划”（波兰的关于在中欧建立无原子武器区的计划）时，杜勒斯说，“现在这种形式的这个计划从军事角度来看对于西方是极为不利的”。杜勒斯的关于“腊帕茨基计划”的言论有很大一部分被检查当局删去了。
    杜勒斯在谈到苏联的强大发展时表示了一种无可奈何的心情，他承认，美国“没有办法去制止俄国的引人注目的工业发展。在我看来，无论如何无法阻止苏联成为经济和军事力量日益强大的国家。”但是，杜勒斯又歪曲真象，企图把事情说成是苏联和整个社会主义阵营的威力不是为了巩固和平，而是为了……“实现世界共产主义的世界野心和企图建立对全世界的统治……”。
    在谈到中国沿海岛屿金门和马祖问题时，民主党康?狄格州众议员切斯特·鲍尔斯向杜勒斯指出：“长期以来，我们当中许多人首先对我们呆在那里（金门和马祖）是否明智表示非常怀疑。”他问杜勒斯“打算采取什么行动、能够采取什么行动来消废我们许多人认为可能引起大规模战争的一种不现实的、危险的局势”。
    杜勒斯对这个问题的回答表明了美国在台湾海峡地区把绞索套紧在脖子上的进退两难的处境。他既表示要继续压迫蒋介石撤离金门和马祖，以便美国任意摆布蒋介石集团，实现其长期霸占中国领土台湾和制造“两个中国”的阴谋，又表示目前还无法作到这一点，害怕这样作会加剧蒋介石的反美情绪，对美国造成“一大串祸害”。
    杜勒斯说，他“不知道有什么办法……来取消金门和马祖的阵地”，他说，这样做将是美国“威胁蒋介石”，这就会使美国“同福摩萨（台湾）的当局疏远，并且引起他们的敌对情绪。这样一来，他们就不会像现在这样是我们的朋友和盟友，而会变得猛烈反美”。
    杜勒斯说，有人说，如果没有金门和马祖问题，情况就会好得多。他说，但是，“在处理如何把我们的朋友赶出这个地方而不会引起一大串祸害这样一个实际问题的时候，我没有发现有什么办法这样做”。
    杜勒斯说，“显然金门和马祖不是很容易防守的地区”，他说，“他们（蒋介石分子）的确撤出过大陈，……如果他们对于金门和马祖也有同样的看法，那是很好的。”
    杜勒斯在作证中还透露了美国正处心积虑打入非洲，以取代西欧没落的帝国主义国家在那里的地位。他要求国会“提供更多的钱”来“发展”美国同非洲国家的关系，并且说，美国“正在训练和配备前往那里的官员和工作人员”。他念念不忘“冷战”说，西方和国际共产主义之间的“冷战”“是双方努力争取全世界不发达地区——中东和非洲——千百万人的人心”。
