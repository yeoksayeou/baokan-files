Careful Thinning, Diligent Soil Heaping, and Increased Fertilization
Xinghua and Zhongxian Counties Strive for High Rapeseed Yields

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 25th: Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, aims for a rapeseed yield of 500 jin per mu this year on its more than 70,000 mu of rapeseed fields, doubling last year's yield, and striving to achieve 800 jin per mu. Currently, more than 75,000 laborers in the county are concentrating on applying root-strengthening and growth-promoting fertilizer to the rapeseed, and in response to the new situation of deep plowing and dense planting of rapeseed this year, they are universally carrying out spring field management work such as thinning seedlings and heaping and compacting soil. Xinghua County is one of the high-yield rapeseed counties in the country. Currently, the rapeseed fields have full stands of seedlings, with an average of about 30,000 plants per mu, the densest having 40,000 plants, and the sparsest having more than 23,000 plants.

In order to apply more spring fertilizer to the rapeseed, the county universally requires three applications of fertilizer from now until the spring equinox. The first application of mud fertilizer has almost been completed on more than 70,000 mu of rapeseed, and a few production teams have already applied the second application of mud slurry fertilizer.

This year, some rapeseed fields have grown vigorously due to early planting, sufficient fertilizer, and a large number of plants. The row spacing has been completely sealed, affecting ventilation and light transmission. Because the deeply plowed soil is loose, the roots need to be compacted, otherwise they are prone to lodging. In response to these two new situations, the Xinghua County Committee of the Communist Party of China has put forward measures such as universal thinning and soil heaping and compaction, which are currently being conscientiously implemented by the people's communes. Duotian, Xinnan, Shagou, Dainan, and other people's communes are universally carrying out thinning work. Duotian Commune deploys commune members with strong cultivation techniques to do the thinning work, which is done very carefully, thinning out small seedlings and keeping large seedlings, thinning out early bolting and keeping normally growing seedlings, to ensure consistent growth. While heaping soil and thinning seedlings, universal attention is paid to removing weeds. In individual areas where rapeseed flea beetles are present, timely pest control is carried out in combination with the application of mud slurry.

Currently, in Xinghua, from the county to the township, brigade, and production team levels, there is a Party branch secretary or team leader responsible for managing rapeseed. All communes in the county have universally organized professional teams for field management.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, February 25th: Zhongxian County, a high-yield rapeseed county in Sichuan, is striving for a greater leap forward this year.

Currently, most of the county's 40,000 mu of rapeseed are about two chi tall, with a circumference of two chi five cun to three chi, and twenty to thirty branches. Seedlings of the third class have basically disappeared. During the recent mass campaign week, 35,000 jin of fertilizer per mu have been applied. The county has more than 2,600 professional groups, leading an army of 80,000 people in fertilizing, weeding, heaping soil, controlling pests, and irrigating in the rapeseed fields. The slogan of the masses is "Seize the season, race against time, and we must harvest 1,000 jin of rapeseed!"

Last year, the average rapeseed yield in Zhongxian County was 231 jin per mu, an increase of more than 51% compared to 1957. Among many high-yield typical cases, some achieved yields of over 500 jin per mu, and 262 rapeseed plants of king class yielded at least half a jin each. After thoroughly summarizing and investigating last year's high-yield experience, the Zhongxian County Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that as long as the "Eight-Character Charter" is meticulously implemented, it is certain that a yield of 1,000 jin per mu can be guaranteed, and efforts should be made to reach more than 1,000 jin.

This year, the county has achieved timely and early sowing, 100% use of superior Victory rapeseed varieties, most of the cultivated land has been deeply plowed to a depth of one chi to two chi five cun, and an average of more than 70,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu has been applied. The county has established rapeseed technology committees headed by the Party committee secretary at all levels, and organized professional teams. On this basis, the county has successively launched several large-scale field management campaigns centered on even seedling distribution, seedling replenishment, setting seedlings, topdressing, weeding, and pest and disease control during the seedling period.

In order to ensure that field management is truly meticulous and practical, and that measures are implemented thoroughly, the Party committees at all levels in Zhongxian County have universally taken the lead in implementing a complete set of management measures throughout the county, with good results.

### 细间苗　勤壅土　多施肥  兴化忠县力争油菜高产

    细间苗　勤壅土　多施肥
    兴化忠县力争油菜高产
    本报南京25日电　江苏省兴化县今年全县七万多亩油菜，要求亩产菜籽五百斤，比去年翻一番，力争实现亩产八百斤。目前全县有七万五千多劳力，突击追施油菜的稳根发棵肥，并针对今年油菜深翻密植的新情况，普遍开展间苗、壅土压实等春季田间管理工作。兴化县是全国油菜的高产县之一，现在油菜亩亩全苗，每亩一般都在三万棵左右，最密的有四万棵，最少的有两万三千多棵。
    全县为了油菜多施春肥，从现在到春分，普遍要求施三次肥。现在七万多亩油菜，第一遍泥肥已快结束；少数生产队已施第二遍泥浆肥。
    今年部分油菜田由于栽得早、肥料充足、棵数多，生长旺盛，株行距已经全部密封，影响通风透光。由于深翻泥松，根部需要压实，否则容易倒伏。中共兴化县委针对这两个新情况，提出的普遍间苗与壅土压实等措施，目前各个人民公社正认真贯彻执行。垛田、新南、沙沟、戴南等人民公社，普遍进行间苗工作。垛田公社调配栽培技术较强的社员做间苗工作，间得很细致，间去小苗留大苗，间去早抽苔，留生长正常的苗，保证生长一致。在壅土间苗的同时，普遍注意清除杂草。在个别地区油菜上有菜芽虫，已经及时结合施浇泥浆灭虫。
    目前兴化从县到乡、大队和生产队，都有一个党支书或队长负责管理油菜。全县各公社都普遍组织了田间管理的专业队伍。

    本报成都25日电　四川油菜高产县忠县，今年力争更大的跃进。
    目前，这个县的四万亩油菜，大部苗高二尺左右，株围二尺五寸到三尺，发枝二十到三十个，三类苗基本绝迹。在最近开展的全民突击周里，每亩油菜已追肥三万五千斤。全县有两千六百多个专业小组，带动八万大军在油菜田里施肥、除草、壅土、治虫、浇灌。广大群众的口号是“抓季节，抢时间，定要油菜收获一千斤！”
    忠县去年油菜平均亩产二百三十一斤，比1957年增产了51％多。在许多高产典型中有的亩产高达五百斤以上，二百六十二株油菜王株产都至少半斤多。中共忠县县委在详细地总结和调查了去年高产经验以后，认为只要细致地贯彻“八字宪法”，保证亩产一千斤是有把握的，而且要力争达到千斤以上。
    今年，全县做到了适时早播，百分之百地使用胜利油菜良种，大部耕地深翻一尺到二尺五寸，每亩平均施底肥七万多斤。全县层层建立了党委书记为首的油菜技术委员会，组织了专业队伍。在这一基础上，全县先后开展了多次声势浩大的匀苗、补苗、定苗、追肥、除草、治病虫等为中心苗期田间管理运动。
    忠县各级党委为了使田间管理真正做到细致踏实，措施到底，党委书记普遍亲自动手，在全县推行了一整套的管理措施，收效良好。（附图片）
