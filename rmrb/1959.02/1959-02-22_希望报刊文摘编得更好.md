    Hoping for Better Compilation of Newspaper and Magazine Digests
    The "Newspaper and Magazine Digest" column opened on page seven of the People's Daily is very good. Now many provinces and cities have established theoretical publications, which contain many good theoretical articles that provide guidance for work, thought, and study. However, due to limited conditions, people cannot read them extensively. The column you compile happens to solve this problem. I hope that in the future, this aspect can be strengthened, the quality improved, and readers' needs met more promptly.

    希望报刊文摘编得更好
    人民日报第七版开辟的“报刊文摘”一栏很好。现在许多省市都办了理论刊物，这些刊物上有许多好的理论文章，对工作、思想、学习有着指导作用。但是由于条件所限，人们不可能广泛阅读。而你们编的这个专栏恰好解决了这个问题。希望今后能在这方面有所加强，提高质量，更为及时地满足读者的需要。　北京政法学院　詹楚材
