    A Simple Coal Washing Plant Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods
    Coal Industry Ministry Production Department Coal Preparation Division Wu Shoupei
    The coal washing plant of Shijiazhuang Coking Plant was one of the earliest to use wooden piston jigging machines. The coal washing machines of many coking plants, such as Xuecheng in Shandong and Handan in Hebei, were made according to the design of the Shijiazhuang coal washing machine. Since the mass steelmaking movement began in the second half of last year, this type of coal washing machine has been widely promoted in many places. One of the main ways to supply "Steel Commander" with a large quantity of high-quality "food" is to build a large number of simple coal washing plants at high speed. Introducing the situation of the coal washing plant of Shijiazhuang Coking Plant will be helpful to this work.
    The Shijiazhuang coal washing plant now has three coal washing machines, which can wash about 3,000 tons of raw coal per day, produce 2,000 to 2,100 tons of coking clean coal, and can wash more than 1 million tons of raw coal per year, producing 700,000 to 720,000 tons of clean coal. Judging from these indicators, it should be a large-scale coal washing plant. People can't help but think of tall sedimentation towers, huge reinforced concrete factory buildings, and huge and complex mechanical equipment, requiring construction investments of thousands of yuan. But in fact, except for the shafts, eccentric wheels, tie rods of several piston jigging machines, the chains of the bucket elevator, the hammers and machine shells of the crusher, which were contracted by some small iron factories in Shijiazhuang, everything else in the Shijiazhuang coal washing plant was solved by the plant itself. They make their own jigging coal washing machines, build their own factory buildings, and repair them themselves if they break down. People may ask: How many lathes, planers, and cupola furnaces does the factory have? In fact, the coal washing plant of Shijiazhuang Coking Plant only has an electric welding machine, a gas welding machine, and a small drilling machine; the rest are small tools such as files, pliers, and hammers. The total construction cost is only about 150,000 yuan. In this way, it is undoubtedly a simple coal washing plant that meets the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical.
    The production system of the Shijiazhuang coal washing plant is as shown in the first figure. If we compare coal washing to the human body, the piston jigging coal washing machine is the "stomach" of the coal washing plant, and the washing water is like the blood of the human body; before entering the coal washing machine, the large pieces of gangue (rocks mixed in the coal) must be picked out, and the large pieces must be crushed, which is like picking out sand when eating and crushing large pieces of food. Raw coal is washed by a jigging machine into clean coal and middlings. After dehydration, the clean coal is sent to coking, and the middlings are used as general fuel. Because the water removed contains a large amount of fine coal powder (called coal slime), it must enter the sedimentation tank for sedimentation. The coal slime settles in the tank, and the clarified water flows into the return water tank, which can be pumped into the coal washing machine for reuse. If we use the human body as an analogy again, then the water pump is the heart of the coal washing plant, the reuse of return water is like blood circulation, and the coal slime sedimentation tank is like the intestine, which also absorbs some beneficial nutrients. The ash content of the coal slime in the first few clean coal sedimentation tanks is about 11%-12%, which can also be mixed into clean coal to produce metallurgical coke; the coal slime in the latter few tanks has a higher ash content (12%-13%), which can only be used to produce No. 2 coke; and a part (accounting for 3%) of the coal slime with a high ash content can be used as general fuel.
    The ash content of the clean coal washed out by the Shijiazhuang coal washing plant is 8% to 10%, and the ash content of the middlings is 50%-60%. When the ash content of the raw coal is 14%-20%, the recovery rate of clean coal reaches 65%-80%. The operators of each coal washing machine and the workers who transport raw coal, clean coal, middlings, dig coal slime, and watch over the elevators require a total of 64 people per shift (eight hours). Each coal washing machine can wash 360 tons of raw coal and produce 240 to 250 tons of clean coal per shift.
    When using manual coal washing, a worker can only wash half a ton to two tons per shift, while each worker in the Shijiazhuang coal washing plant can wash five to six tons per shift.
    The reason why they can achieve such results is mainly because the coal washing machine they use has a good structure, they have skilled operation techniques, and the quality inspection is relatively scientific and strict.
    The structure of the Shijiazhuang piston jigging machine is like the second figure. The upper part of the machine shell is a rectangular box, and the lower part has four funnels. The machine body is made of wooden boards. The coal washing machine is divided into two sections in length and three sections in width, for a total of six parts. The middle of the jigging machine is the piston chamber (total area 2×0.62×1.35=1.67 square meters), which contains a piston, driven by a tie rod and an eccentric wheel, making up and down movements. The two sides are the coal washing chambers (the total area of the two sides is 4×1.35×0.60=3.24 square meters), which have sieve plates made of iron plates, and quartz stone blocks are laid on the sieves. The lower part of the piston chamber and the coal washing chamber are connected, which is filled with water. Due to the up and down movement of the piston, the water in the coal washing chamber also moves up and down. When the piston moves downward, the water in the coal washing chamber moves upward, opening the paved quartz stone and forming channels, and making the raw coal loose, and the light clean coal floats to the upper layer. When the piston moves upward, the water flow gradually changes from upward to downward, and the heavy gangue particles fall into the funnel at the bottom of the jigging machine through the channels and sieve holes between the quartz stones. When accumulated to a certain amount, pull up the plumb bob and open the slag discharge port to discharge it. When the water flows downward, and the clean coal may fall down, the quartz stone forms a tight bed layer, blocking the channel, thus achieving the purpose of separating clean coal and gangue. The gangue discharged through the sieve in the first section has a high ash content, and the No. 2 coal discharged through the sieve in the second section has a lower ash content than gangue, but higher than clean coal. To use an analogy: when the washing water in the coal washing chamber rises, the gangue particles and coal particles are arranged in order of weight (actually also in order of size), the heavy gangue is arranged at the bottom, and the "gate" is opened at the same time to prepare for the gangue particles to pass through. When the water in the coal washing chamber drops, after the gangue particles pass through the "gate", the door is closed to keep the clean coal "out of the door."
    There are many factors that affect the operation of the coal washing machine. The same machine, whether it is operated well or not, will make a big difference in the coal washing effect. Operating methods:
    1.  Coal feeding: The coal feeding should be uniform. Coal washing workers and raw coal transporting workers should be closely connected. Uniform coal feeding is the main condition for washing coal well.
    2.  Washing water: The water used for coal feeding should not be too much, just enough to flush the coal. However, when the coal quality is good, the water can be larger, and when the coal is bad, the water should be smaller.
    3.  Top water: Most of the water used in the coal washing machine is top water. When the quality of raw coal is bad and contains a lot of gangue, the top water should be smaller to strengthen the suction force and discharge more gangue; when the coal contains less gangue, the top water should be larger to reduce the suction force and avoid the loss of clean coal.
    Generally speaking, when the coal is good, the amount of raw coal processed can be increased, so more water should be used; when the coal is relatively difficult to select and contains a lot of gangue, the water should be appropriately reduced to make it stay in the coal washing machine for a longer time and be subjected to hydraulic action for a longer time.
    4.  Laying quartz stone: The stones in the first section should be laid thinner, and the stones in the second section should be laid thicker. When the quality of raw coal is good, it should be laid thicker, and when the quality of raw coal is bad, it should be laid thinner.
    5.  Discharge gangue: The interval time for discharging gangue should be determined according to the amount of gangue in the raw coal. For example, when washing good coal, the interval time should be longer, 4-5 minutes for one discharge; when washing bad coal, the interval time should be shorter, 2-3 minutes for one discharge. When discharging gangue, the plumb bob should not be lifted too high, and it should be put down quickly. The opening should not be too large, and the discharging time should not be too long, because too much discharge will affect the coal washing situation on the sieve surface.
    6.  Check the quality of raw coal to correctly guide the operation. (Attached pictures)

专栏：洗煤炼焦经验介绍

    一个土洋结合的简易洗煤厂
    煤炭工业部生产司选煤处　吴寿培
    石家庄炼焦厂的洗煤厂是使用木质活塞跳汰机较早的一个厂。许多炼焦厂的洗煤机，像山东薛城、河北邯郸，都是照石家庄洗煤机的样子制作的。自从去年下半年全民炼钢运动轰轰烈烈地展开以后，这种洗煤机在很多地方已经大量推行。为了给“钢帅”供应数量多、质量好的“食粮”主要办法之一是高速度地建设大量的简易洗煤厂。介绍石家庄炼焦厂的洗煤厂的情况，会有助于这个工作。
    石家庄洗煤厂现在有三个洗煤机，一天可以洗三千吨左右原煤，生产二千到二千一百吨炼焦精煤，一年就可以洗一百多万吨原煤，生产七十至七十二万吨精煤。由这几个指标来看，应该是个大型洗煤厂，人们不禁就会连想到有高高的沉淀塔，有巨大的钢筋混凝土厂房，有庞大复杂的机械设备，需要上千万元的建设投资。但实际上，石家庄洗煤厂除了几个活塞跳汰机的轴、偏心轮、拉杆、斗式提升机的链子，破碎机的锤子和机壳是由石家庄市的一些小铁工厂承制外，其他的全部是本厂解决的。他们自己做跳汰洗煤机，自己盖厂房，坏了自己修理。人们也许会问起：厂子有几台车床、刨床和化铁炉？其实，石家庄焦厂的洗煤厂只有一个电焊机，一个气焊机和一个小钻床；其它就是锉、钳、锤等小工具。全厂建设费用大概只有十五万元左右。这样，不用说是个符合多、快、好、省的简易洗煤厂。
    石家庄洗煤厂的生产系统像第一图所表示的，若把洗煤比作人体，活塞跳汰洗煤机是洗煤厂的“胃”，洗水好像人体的血液；在进入洗煤机之前，要把大块的矸石（煤中混入的岩石）拣出去，把大块进行破碎，这好像吃饭时挑去砂子，嚼碎大块食品一样。原煤经过跳汰机洗选分成精煤和中煤，经过脱水以后，精煤送去炼焦，中煤用作一般燃料。因为脱下的水中有大量的细煤粉（称为煤泥），所以要分别进入沉淀池沉淀，煤泥就沉在池内，澄清后的水流入回水池，还可以用泵打入洗煤机再用，假使我们再用人体来比的话，那末水泵是洗煤厂的心脏，回水使用就像血液循环，煤泥沉淀池像肠，它又吸收了一部分有益养分。头几个精煤沉淀池的煤泥灰分在11％—12％左右，还可以掺入精煤炼冶金焦；后几个池子的煤泥灰分较高（12％—13％），只能炼二号焦；还有一部分（占3％）灰分很多的煤泥，可以作为一般的燃料。
    石家庄洗煤厂洗出精煤的灰分是8％到10％，中煤灰分是50％—60％，当原煤灰分是14％—20％时，精煤回收率达到65％—80％。每台洗煤机的操作工人和运输原煤，精煤，中煤，挖煤泥，看管提升机等工作的工人加在一起，每个班（八小时）需要六十四人。每个班每台洗煤机能洗原煤三百六十吨，生产精煤二百四十至二百五十吨。
    用人工洗煤时，一个工人一班仅能洗半吨到二吨，而石家庄洗煤厂每个工人一班能洗五到六吨。
    他们所以能取得这样的效果，主要是他们所用的洗煤机结构好，操作技术熟练，质量检查比较科学和严格。
    石家庄活塞跳汰机的构造像第二图那样，机壳的上部是长方箱子，下部有四个漏斗。机体用木板做成，洗煤机长分二段，宽分三格，共是六个部分。跳汰机中间是活塞室（总面积2×0.62×1.35＝1.67平方公尺）其中有活塞，用拉杆和偏心轮传动，作上下运动。二边是洗煤室（二边总面积4×1.35×0.60＝3.24平方公尺），有铁板做的筛板，筛上铺石英石块。活塞室与洗煤室的下部是相连通的，其中充满着水。由于活塞作上下运动，洗煤室里的水也作上下运动。活塞向下时，洗煤室内的水向上，把铺的石英石冲开形成孔道，并且使原煤得到松散，轻的精煤就浮到上层。活塞向上时，水流由向上逐渐转为向下，重的矸石粒就通过石英石间的孔道和筛孔落入跳汰机下部的漏斗里。积聚到一定量时，就拉上垂铊，开启排渣口排出。而当水流向下，精煤有可能掉下时，石英石就形成紧密的床层，把通道堵起，这样就达到精煤和矸石分开的目的。第一段透过筛网排出的是矸石，灰分高，第二段透过筛网排出的是二号煤，灰分比矸石为低，但比精煤为高。打一个比喻说：洗煤室洗水上升时，让矸石粒和煤粒按轻重不同（实际还按大小不同）排排队，重的矸石排在下面，并同时打开了“大门”准备让矸石粒通过，洗煤室水下降时矸石粒通过“大门”后，门就关上，把精煤“拒于门外”。
    影响洗煤机的操作的因素很多，同一个机械，操作得好和不好，洗煤的效果会相差很多。操作方法：
    1、给煤：给煤要均匀，洗煤工人和运原煤的工人要密切联系，均匀给煤是洗好煤的主要条件。
    2、冲水：给煤用水不能太大，只要能冲动煤就可以。但煤质好的时候，水可大些，煤坏的时候，水应该小些。
    3、顶水：洗煤机用水大部分是顶水，在原煤质量坏含矸石多的时候，顶水应该小一些，以加强下吸力量，多排矸石；煤中含矸少时，顶水应该大一些，以减少下吸力量，避免精煤损失。
    拿总的用水量来说，煤好可以加大原煤处理量，所以应该多用水；煤比较难选，含矸石多，用水应该相应地小一些，使它在洗煤机里停留的时间长一些，受水力作用的时间长一些。
    4、铺石英石子：第一段的石子应铺薄一些，第二段石子铺厚一些。原煤煤质好应该铺厚一些，原煤煤质坏应该铺薄一些。
    5、放矸石：要根据原煤中含矸石的数量来确定排矸间隔的时间，比如洗好煤隔时间长一些，4—5分钟放一次；洗坏煤，隔时间短一些，2—3分钟放一次，放矸石时垂铊提起不能太高，并且要很快放下去，开口不能太大，放矸时间不能太长，因为放的多会影响筛面上的洗煤情况。
    6、要检查原煤质量，以正确地指导操作。（附图片）
