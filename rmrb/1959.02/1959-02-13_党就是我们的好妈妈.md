    The Party is Our Good Mother
    Comrade Lu Hong’s "Mother-Son Affection, Comradeship Love" is a worthwhile article and a textbook on new family life. It helps us understand the relationship between the large family and the small family more profoundly. I particularly recommend it to mothers across the country (fathers should also read it) and young friends. I shed tears while reading this article, and the more I read it, the more intimate and warm I felt.
    There are many kinds of "affection" and "love" in the world, but what in the world is deeper and more precious than our communist "mother-son affection" and "comradeship love" today? In our country, mothers and sons are in a mother-son relationship and also in a comradeship relationship. Parents raise their children not to "guard against old age," but regard it as the responsibility that every revolutionary should fulfill in the large revolutionary family. "My" son is also "our" son, and "my" parents are also "our" parents. "I" and "we" are already a single, inseparable entity here. I deeply love such a mother, and such a mother is also our Party and collective; when we say the Party and collective, we mean such a mother. I am also proud to have a son like Mother Lu Hong. Such a son is a good son, "our mother's son." Such a son is a role model for our youth today!

### 党就是我们的好妈妈

    党就是我们的好妈妈
    陆红同志的“母子情、同志爱”是一篇值得一读的好文章，是一本关于新家庭生活的教科书，他帮助我们更加深刻地理解了大家庭和小家庭的关系。我特向全国的母亲（做父亲的也应该读一读）和青年朋友们推荐。我自己在读这篇文章的时候是流了眼泪的，读了又读，越读越感到亲切，越感到温暖。
    世上有许许多多种的“情”和“爱”，但世上又有什么能比我们今天的共产主义式的“母子情”和“同志爱”更深更宝贵的呢？在我们的国家里，母亲和儿子是母子关系，又是同志关系。父母教养儿女不是为了“防老”，而是把它看作在革命的大家庭里每个革命者应尽的责任。“我”的儿子也就是“我们”的儿子，“我”的父母也就是“我们”的父母，“我”和“我们”在这里已是二而一，不可分的统一体了。我深深敬爱这样的妈妈，这样的妈妈，也就是我们的党和集体；我们说党和集体，也就是指这样的妈妈。我也为有像陆红妈妈那样的儿子而感到自豪，这样的儿子才是好儿子，是“我们妈妈的儿子”。这样的儿子是今天我们青年的楷模！
