To A'gen:

I want to tell you two good news: I have been named a socialist construction activist in Hangzhou; a few days ago, I joined the Communist Party of China and became a probationary member.

Last April, after you sent back your certificate of merit from the army, I decided to learn from you and catch up with you. After entering the commune's coking plant, I became the women's team leader, leading seventy women day and night to refine coke to support the Iron Marshal's ascension. To pick up bricks and build kilns, several of us women worked even harder than men. One night, it rained, and we thought of the coal briquettes drying in the open, so we rushed to the factory to cover them with reed mats.

How could I not work hard! Since the establishment of the commune, life has become sweeter and sweeter. Dad and my two older brothers are blacksmithing in the commune, my younger sister is studying, and I, a rural woman, can also enter a factory, learn technology, and be promoted from a fourth-grade worker to a fifth-grade worker. The commune has set up many nurseries, kindergartens, and canteens. Our production team also has a canteen, a nursery, and a kindergarten. We eat in the canteen, the children go to kindergarten, and even women who never participated in field labor in the past are happily going to the fields to work. You remember Sister-in-law Wenlong next door, right? In the past, she was so busy taking care of her children and housework that she couldn't manage everything. Now, all four of her children have entered the nursery and kindergarten, and she herself has joined me in the coking plant, working very hard and has been named an activist in the factory twice. She said: Now we are truly enjoying Chairman Mao's blessings. The commune takes special care of women. Men can rest for two days a month, and women can rest for five days. During the holidays, everyone takes their children back from the nursery and does some washing and sewing at home, living a very organized life. The women all say: In the past, "people were in the fields, but their hearts were at home," children ran around unattended, and they were afraid of water and fire, like ants crawling on a stone slab in summer. Now, nurseries and kindergartens take care of everything—food, clothing, and sleep. Production and rest are worry-free, and women are like living gods! Because the housework and children's burdens of women have been solved, everyone is wholeheartedly engaged in production.

A'gen, don't worry about things at home. I hope you will work harder, train well, learn your skills, and defend the construction of the motherland and our happy life. As for myself, I must work even better, improve the quality of coke, produce more coke, produce more iron, and support you!

    万水千山寄佳音阿根：
    我要告诉你两个好消息：我已被评为杭州市社会主义建设积极分子；前几天，我又参加了中国共产党，成为一个预备党员。
    去年4月，你从部队寄回奖状以后，我就决心向你学习，要赶上你。进了公社的炼焦厂后，我当了妇女队长，领导七十来个妇女日日夜夜炼焦炭，支援钢铁元帅升帐。为了拾砖头盖窑，我们几个妇女比男人干得还起劲。夜里天下雨，我们就想到露天晾着的煤饼，赶到厂里去盖芦扉。
    我怎么能够不好好的干呢！办起公社以后，日子真是越过越甜。爸爸和大哥、二哥在公社打铁，妹妹在读书，我一个农村妇女也能进工厂，学会了技术，并由四级工升到五级工。社里办起了许多托儿所、幼儿园、食堂，我们生产小队里也有一个食堂、一个托儿所和一个幼儿园。吃饭在食堂，小孩进幼儿园，连过去从来不参加田里劳动的妇女，也欢天喜地地去田里做活了。隔壁的文龙嫂，你总知道的吧！她过去拖儿带女连家务也忙不过来，现在四个孩子都进了幼儿园、托儿所，她自己也和我一起进了炼焦厂，工作得挺起劲，已有二次评上了厂里的积极分子。她说：现在真是享毛主席的福。社里对妇女照顾得特别周到，男人一个月休息两天，妇女可以休息五天。放了假，大家就从托儿所里领回孩子，在家里洗洗缝缝，生活得真是有条有理。妇女们都说：过去是“人在田间心在家”，孩子乱窜无人管，又怕水来又怕火，好比夏天蚂蚁爬在石板上。现在是托儿所来幼儿园、管吃管穿管睡觉，生产休息都安心，妇女好比活神仙！因为解决了妇女的家务和孩子的牵累问题，大家都一心去搞生产。
    阿根，家里的事情你尽管放心。希望你进一步努力，练好兵，学好本领，保卫祖国的建设，保卫我们的幸福生活。我自己呢，一定要更好地干，提高焦炭的质量，多出炭、多出铁，支援你们！
