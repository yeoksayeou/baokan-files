    Shandong - Grasp Moisture Preservation, Grasp Seeds, Grasp Tools
    Shanxi - 100,000 People Inspect Spring Plowing Preparations
    (Our dispatch from Jinan, February 19th) The land in Shandong has completely thawed, and spring plowing preparations are extraordinarily busy.
    In order to do a good job in this year's spring sowing preparations, Shandong has conducted investigations everywhere, discovering that the focus of this year's preparations is to grasp moisture preservation, prepare seeds, and repair and manufacture water lifting tools and small farm implements.
    Currently, Shandong has mobilized a large force to vigorously work on land preparation and moisture preservation, and irrigate barren land. The Liaocheng area has harrowed 2.7 million mu of land, and five counties, including Xiazjin and Guanxian, have plowed more than 153,000 mu; at the same time, efforts are concentrated on irrigating barren land. In terms of seed preparation, Zibo, Liaocheng, and Changwei areas, as well as cotton-producing areas, have universally begun selecting cotton seeds, drying good seeds, and conducting seed germination tests. Xiazjin, Pingyuan, and Linqing counties have established 437 seedling greenhouses and 10,000 sets of cotton nutrient pots. Where seeds are insufficient, communes are being mobilized to adjust and exchange with each other. Regarding tool preparation, Shandong has mobilized more than 500,000 iron and wood workers to add a large number of new farm tools by repairing, manufacturing, and finding them. According to incomplete statistics from the Department of Agriculture on 46 counties alone, more than 2 million various farm tools have been produced.

    (Our dispatch from Taiyuan, February 19th) People's communes in Shanxi are seizing the time and rushing the season, comprehensively launching a spring plowing upsurge.
    The province's large army of more than 4 million people for accumulating fertilizer, after more than 20 days of hard work, has accumulated more than 7.67 billion dan of various farm fertilizers, completing more than 76% of the original fertilizer accumulation plan of 10 billion dan, making the average basic farmland in the province receive nearly 20,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, more than five times more than the same period last year. All localities have organized various means of transportation as early as possible to deliver 40% of the fertilizer to the fields before thawing. In order to prevent spring drought, the province combined land improvement and ice-breaking to divert water to irrigate more than 3.1 million mu of cultivated land, expanding the irrigated area by 50% compared with the same period last year.
    Farmers in the southern and northern Shanxi areas immediately unfolded top-ice harrowing and land rolling after heavy snow to prevent moisture evaporation. More than 1 million pieces of farm tools have been repaired and manufactured everywhere, with more than 1.2 billion jin of various improved seeds. The broad masses of commune members are also seizing the gaps in production to repair commonly used small farm tools.
    Recently, Jinbei and Jinzhong areas have jointly organized more than 100,000 people from special districts, counties, and communes into spring plowing promotion groups to go to various places to carry out cross-inspections, further pushing spring plowing preparations to a new upsurge.

    山东——抓保墒抓种籽抓工具
    山西——十万人检查备耕
    本报济南19日电　山东大地已经全部消冻，备耕工作分外繁忙。
    为搞好今年的春播准备工作，山东各地都进行了摸底工作，发现今年备耕工作的重点是抓保墒、准备种子和修造提水工具和小农具。
    目前，山东省各地已调动千军万马，大力突击整地保墒，灌溉白地。聊城专区已耙地二百七十万亩，夏津、冠县等五县已耕地十五万三千多亩；同时，集中力量突击浇灌白地。在准备种子工作上，淄博、聊城、昌潍等专区以及棉产区，已普遍开始粒选棉种，翻晒良种，并做种子发芽试验。夏津、平原、临清三个县，已建立育苗温室四百三十七间，棉花营养钵工具一万多套。种子不足的地方，正在发动各公社互相调剂交换。工具准备方面，山东省各地动员了五十多万铁木工人，采用修理、制造、找寻等办法，增添了大批新农具。仅据农业厅对四十六个县的不完全统计，已生产各种农具二百多万件。

    本报太原19日电　山西省各地人民公社抓时间抢季节，全面掀起了备耕热潮。
    全省一支由四百多万人组成的积肥大军，经过二十多天的奋战，已经积好各种农家肥七十六亿七千多万担，完成了原积肥计划百亿担的76％强，使全省基本农田平均每亩得到肥料近二万斤，比去年同期增加五倍多。各地都及早组织了各种运输工具，要在解冻前把40％的肥料送到田里。为了防止春旱，全省结合整修土地，破冰引水灌溉耕地三百一十多万亩，浇水比去年同期扩大灌溉面积50％。
    晋南晋北地区农民，在大雪过后，立即展开了顶凌耙地和滚轧土地，防止水分的蒸发。各地修补和制造的农具有一百多万件，有各种良种十二亿多斤。广大社员也都抓紧生产空隙，整修常用的小农具。
    最近晋北晋中等地区由专、县、公社联合组织了十多万人的春耕促进团分赴各地，展开了交叉检查，把备耕工作进一步推向新的高潮。
