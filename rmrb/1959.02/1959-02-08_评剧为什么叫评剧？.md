　　During the Spring Festival, many Pingju programs such as "Bitter Vegetable Flowers" and "Judge Bao Thrice Investigates the Butterfly Dream" will be performed; audiences in the north have long been familiar with and fond of Pingju as a type of opera. However, why is Pingju called Pingju? Probably many people still don't understand.

　　Why is Pingju called Pingju? It's a long story. Pingju has only developed in the last few decades from the Jidong area of Hebei Province. If the founders of Pingju were still alive, they would only be in their eighties or nineties today. These founders were mostly farmers who, due to poverty, had to travel to villages or market towns to perform Lianhualuo during the slack farming season to make a living. This form of Lianhualuo was very developed in Jidong, and almost every village had Lianhualuo performers. Around 1891 (the seventeenth year of the Guangxu reign), the Bengbeng art from the Northeast, now called "Errenzhuan," was introduced to Jidong along the railway line. Bengbeng art used a female and a male clown, singing and dancing in the inns and squares of Jidong. This art form was more lively and the music was more beautiful than Lianhualuo, so the Lianhualuo performers in Jidong fell in love with this form and quickly learned it. Bengbeng could perform many stories in large sets, such as "Romance of the West Chamber" and "Wang Erjie Yearns for Her Husband," which was even more popular with the people of Jidong. This art form quickly developed from the villages and small towns of Jidong to the industrial city of Tangshan, and from street performances to performances in teahouses. This art form had a close connection with the miners and mechanical workers of Tangshan and received their support.

　　Precisely because these performers used to sing Lianhualuo and Bengbeng, the masses called this art form "Luozi" or "Bengbeng." This name was used for many years. However, this was just its nickname; it also had a formal name, which was "Pingju."

　　The transition from the Bengbeng art form to the Pingju art form was a major change, led by the Pingju founder, playwright Cheng Zhaocai, who came from a peasant background, and the famous Pingju actor Yue Mingzhu. The time was about fifty years ago. This change was caused by many reasons. For example, the original Bengbeng form focused on singing and dancing. A story like "Wang Erjie Yearns for Her Husband" required singing several hundred lines in just twenty minutes, at most half an hour, which the actors found very tiring. Performing in the square for a short time wasn't a big problem, but on the small stage of the teahouse, performing for five or six hours, with only a female and a male clown singing stories, required more than a dozen stories, which was both tiring and monotonous. At that time, Bengbeng art only had percussion instruments and suona accompaniment, without stringed instruments, which the performers also felt was insufficient. In addition, the reactionaries banned "Bengbeng" from performing in Tangshan, adding many hypocritical and moralistic accusations to it. So, this hurdle was quite difficult to overcome.

　　Therefore, Mr. Cheng Zhaocai vigorously wrote new plays, such as "Matchmaker," "Wang Shaoan Catches the Boat," and "Widow Ma Opens a Shop," transforming Bengbeng from a singing and dancing form into a opera form. There was dialogue and singing, and one person played one role. Musically, it absorbed the stringed instruments of Hebei Bangzi and also absorbed the melodies of Hebei Bangzi, incorporating them into the Bengbeng singing style, transforming Bengbeng from a tune-based music to a ban-based music, which is opera music. Hebei Bangzi is accustomed to singing in falsetto, so there are many high-pitched melodies. Bengbeng performers use their natural voices to sing, which is "flat singing." Cheng Zhaocai gave this newly created art form a fresh formal name, called "Pingqiang Bangzi Opera" (abbreviated as "Pingxi"). So, with this name, performances in Tangshan were resumed.

　　Later, when the Kuomintang reactionaries renamed Beijing as Beiping, Peking Opera was correspondingly renamed Ping Opera. These two "Ping Operas" became somewhat difficult to distinguish. Therefore, our predecessors added a "speech" radical to the side of their "Ping" character, and explained that this type of opera had the meaning of "commenting on the past and discussing the present." This explanation was not without reason, because at that time, in addition to performing some historical plays such as "Recognizing Mother at the Well" and "Returning the Cup," they also performed modern plays such as "Yang Sanjie Sues" and "Sawing Bowl Ding." The meaning of "commenting on the past and discussing the present" is very good and can still give us inspiration today.

　　This is the origin of why Pingju is called Pingju.

    评剧为什么叫评剧？
  　胡沙
    春节期间，要演出很多评剧节目如“苦菜花”、“包公三勘蝴蝶梦”等；北方观众，长期以来，也都熟悉和喜好评剧这个剧种。然而评剧为什么叫做评剧？恐怕还有许多人弄不清楚。
    评剧为什么叫评剧呢？说起来话长。评剧是近几十年才从河北省冀东地区发展起来的。评剧的创始者们如果活着，今天也只有八九十岁。这些创始者多半是农民，由于生活贫苦，只得在农闲时到各村或集镇打莲花落谋生。这种莲花落形式在冀东很发达，许多村子差不多都有莲花落艺人。在1891年（光绪十七年）左右，东北的蹦蹦艺术，现在叫做“二人转”的，顺着铁道线传到了冀东。蹦蹦艺术用一旦一丑，且歌且舞的形式在冀东的客店和广场表演。这种艺术形式比莲花落更活泼，音乐更优美，所以冀东的莲花落艺人们爱上了这种形式，并很快的把它学过来了。蹦蹦可以成本大套地表演许多故事，如“西厢记”、“王二姐思夫”等，就更加受到冀东人民的喜爱。这种艺术形式很快的从冀东的乡村和小镇发展到了工业城市唐山，并从打地摊迁到茶园演出。这种艺术形式同唐山的矿工机械工人很有缘份，得到了他们的支持。
    正因为这些艺人从前是唱莲花落和唱蹦蹦的，所以群众就把这种艺术形式叫做“落子”或“蹦蹦”。这个名字一直被叫了许多年。不过这都是他的小名，他还有一个大名呢，这个大名就是“评剧”。
    从蹦蹦艺术形式到评剧艺术形式是一个很大的变革，领导这个变革的是评剧创始人农民出身的剧作家成兆才和著名的评剧演员月明珠。时间约在五十年前。这个变革是由许多原因所引起的。比方原来蹦蹦形式以歌舞为主，一个故事如“王二姐思夫”，要唱好几百句，时间不过二十分钟，顶多半个钟头，演员感到非常吃力。在广场演出时间短，问题不大，到了茶园的小台上，一演就是五六个钟头，尽是一旦一丑的唱故事，总得有十多个才行，演起来既吃力，也单调。蹦蹦艺术当时只有打击乐器和唢呐伴奏，没有弦乐器，艺人们也觉得不足。再加上反动派禁止“蹦蹦”在唐山演出，给它加上了许多假仁义道德的罪名。所以这一关还相当不好过。
    于是成兆才老先生就大力的编写新戏，如“花为媒”、“王少安赶船”、“马寡妇开店”等，使蹦蹦从歌舞形式变成了戏曲形式。有说有唱，一个人演一个角色。音乐上吸收了河北梆子的弦乐器，并吸收了河北梆子的腔调，揉到蹦蹦唱腔中去，使蹦蹦从曲牌音乐变成了板头音乐，也就是戏曲音乐。河北梆子习惯于唱假声，所以高腔多。蹦蹦艺人们采用真声来唱，也就是“平腔”。成兆才为这种新创的艺术形式取了一个新鲜的大名，叫做“平腔梆子戏”（简称“平戏”）。于是用这个名子又恢复了在唐山的演出。
    后来，又碰上国民党反动派把北京改称北平，京戏随着改称平剧。这两个“平剧”就有些不好分。于是，我们的前辈就在自己的“平”字旁边，加了一个言字，并且解释这个剧种有“评古论今”的含意。这种解释也不是无来由的，因为当时他们除了演些古装戏如“井台认母”、“回杯记”之外，还演出时装戏如“杨三姐告状”、“锯碗丁”等。“评古论今”这个含意很好，到今天还能给我们以启发。
    这就是评剧为什么叫做评剧的来历。
