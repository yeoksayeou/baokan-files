    Spring Festival Greetings with Soaring Enthusiasm
    Féng Róngfāng, First Secretary of the Yongledian People's Commune Committee, Beijing

    The Yongledian People's Commune used to be a well-known low-lying alkaline area in Tongzhou District, Beijing. Every spring, the salt and alkali that seeped up from the ground looked like a blanket of snow, a vast expanse of white. Throughout the years, spring droughts were followed by summer floods, and in normal years, the grain harvest was meager. Even if we occasionally had a bumper year, "cheap grain hurt farmers, and a good harvest became a disaster." A folk song described the suffering of the masses before liberation: "Low-lying alkaline land, poor four districts, impoverished life beyond mention, ordinary years of bran and vegetable meals, ragged clothes worn year-round, drought and flood lead to hunger..."

    After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and with strong support from the government, Yongledian also organized mutual aid teams and gradually realized cooperativization, vigorously developing production and building small-scale water conservancy projects. Grain production increased year by year, and the yield of low-lying alkaline land rose from dozens of pounds per mu in the past to more than one hundred pounds. The lives of the masses gradually improved. However, due to the original barren land and the limitations of manpower and resources in the production cooperatives, large-scale water conservancy projects could not be built. In addition, waterlogging has increased sharply in recent years, and the Liangshui River has flooded year after year. Therefore, the farmers here need strong support from the government in both production and life.

    In order to develop production to a higher level and completely change the face of poverty, in 1957, we implemented the merger of small cooperatives into large cooperatives. Through cooperation between cooperatives, we built two large and small reservoirs, four storage ponds, and four canals, turning some of the low-lying alkaline land that used to grow sorghum and barnyard grass into rice paddies. In particular, after hard work and arduous struggle from the winter of 1957 to the spring of 1958, we completed 2.87 million cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy projects, basically achieving the ability to irrigate during droughts and prevent floods during floods.

    Since our establishment of the People's Commune last September, the appearance of Yongledian has changed dramatically. More than eighty large and small factories have been established for grain processing, winemaking, sugar making, papermaking, iron and woodworking repair and manufacturing, and sewing. Two small hydropower stations have been built, and homes for the elderly and nurseries have been established. Free meals are now provided. The commune now has electric lights, a broadcasting station, a film projection team, and telephones installed in every village... After seeing these facts, the members of the commune were very moved and became even more motivated, vigorously engaged in deep plowing and fertilizer accumulation, deeply plowing all of this year's 57,000 mu of wheat land and more than 47,000 mu of basic farmland to a depth of more than one and a half feet, applying about 50,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu. While working, they sang:

    Yongledian is a good place,
    Comparing today and yesterday, things are not the same.
    In the past, we ate bran and vegetables year-round,
    Now the rice smells fragrant.
    Deep plowing and fertilization make crops grow well,
    This year will be even better than last year.

    At present, the commune members have all completed the winter watering and topdressing tasks for the wheat fields, and have once again launched a high tide of fertilizer accumulation. All commune members, regardless of gender or age, have invested in the movement to accumulate and create fertilizer. Now, as long as you come to Yongledian, you can see people digging pit mud here and building manure circles there; some get up before dawn, and others are still working with lanterns and torches at night. Commune cadres used to love to ride bicycles when they went to the countryside, but now they have put down their bicycles and picked up manure baskets. Teachers and students at schools, and staff members of supply and marketing cooperatives and banks, also use their spare time to collect manure. A major fertilizer accumulation competition has unfolded in the commune between branches and branches, groups and groups, and people and people, with no one willing to be left behind. Communist Party members and Youth League members are taking the lead even more, and many have doubled their allocated fertilizer accumulation targets. After a few days of hard work, as of January 31st, the commune had accumulated more than 630 million jin of fertilizer and created more than 22 million jin of soil fertilizer. Now, in front of and behind the houses of commune members, on both sides of the roads, and in the fields, there are piles of shiny black fertilizer everywhere. From these piles of fertilizer, the commune members saw heavy ears of wheat, smelled the fragrance of rice, and saw that cotton, soybeans, peanuts, and sesame were also growing very vigorously... Everyone is full of confidence and determination to use the soaring enthusiasm for fertilizer accumulation to welcome the beautiful 1959 Spring Festival and our more prosperous days!

    冲天干劲迎新春
    中共北京市永乐店人民公社委员会第一书记　冯荣芳
    永乐店人民公社，过去是北京市通州区著名的低洼盐碱地区，每逢春天，地下返上来的盐碱，像下过一场雪一样，白茫茫的一片。历年春旱夏溢，在一般年景内，粮食所收无几。就是偶然遇到一个丰收年，也是“谷贱伤农，丰收成灾”。有一首歌谣形容解放前群众生活的疾苦：“低洼盐碱穷四区，贫困生活没法提，一般年景糠菜饭，常年穿的破烂衣，旱涝成灾饿肚皮……”
    解放以后，在党的领导和政府的大力支持下，永乐店也组织了互助组，逐步实现了合作化，大力发展了生产，兴办了小型水利。粮食产量逐年增加，低洼盐碱地从过去的亩产几十斤，提高到一百多斤。群众的生活逐步得到了改善。但是由于原来土地瘠薄，和生产合作社中人力、物力的限制，不能兴办大型水利，加以几年来沥水骤增，凉水河连年泛滥，因此这里的农民不论在生产上、生活上，都需要政府大力支持。
    为了更高地发展生产，彻底改变贫困面貌，1957年，我们就实行了小社合并大社。通过社与社的协作，兴修了大、小水库两座，蓄水池四处，水渠四处，变部分种高粱、稗子的低洼碱地为稻田。特别是经过1957年冬季到1958年春季的苦战、苦干，完成了二百八十七万土方的水利工程后，基本上达到了旱可浇，涝可防。
    去年9月，我们成立了人民公社后，永乐店的面貌改变得就大了。办起了粮食加工、制酒、制糖、造纸、铁木业修配制造、缝纫等大小工厂八十多个，小型水力发电站两处，建立了敬老院、托儿所，实行了吃饭不要钱。现在公社已经有了电灯、广播站、电影队，村村安上了电话……社员看到这些事实后非常感动，更加鼓足了干劲，大闹深翻和积肥，把今年的五万七千亩小麦地和四万七千多亩基本农田，全部深翻到一尺半以上，每亩施了底肥五万斤左右。他们一边劳动，一边唱着：
    永乐店啦好地方，
    今昔对比不一样。
    往日常年糠菜饭，
    如今米饭喷喷香。
    深翻施肥庄稼好，
    今年更比去年强。
    目前，社员们已经全部完成麦田冬浇、追肥任务，又一次掀起了积肥高潮。全体社员，不分男女老幼，人人投入了积肥、造肥运动。现在只要你到永乐店，就可以看见这里在挖坑泥，那里在起粪圈；有的不等黎明就起床，有的夜晚还在打着灯笼火把干。公社干部们原来下乡都爱骑车，现在他们放下自行车背起了粪筐来。学校的教师和学生，供销社和银行的工作人员，也都利用业余时间去拣粪。在公社里展开了分社与分社、组与组、人与人之间的积肥大竞赛，谁也不肯让人。共产党员和青年团员们更是带头领先，许多人都把分配下来的积肥指标翻了一番。经过大家几天的苦战，到1月31日止，公社已积肥六亿三千多万斤，造土化肥二千二百多万斤。现在在社员们的宅前屋后，在道路两旁，在地头上，到处是乌光闪闪的肥料堆。从这一个个肥堆里，社员们看到了沉甸甸的麦穗，闻到了稻香，还有那些棉花、大豆、花生和芝麻，也都长得十分茁壮……大家正满怀着信心和决心，要用冲天的积肥干劲来迎接美好的1959年新春和我们更加富裕的日子！
