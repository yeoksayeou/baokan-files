On "Detailed"
    Wang Wentao

    Things become more and more detailed as they are done, and this is also an objective law. Just to give an example, such as eating and dressing, people started by eating tree bark and grass roots, devouring raw wild animals, and wearing leaves and animal skins. Later, they planted crops, ate grains, spun thread, and wove cloth. Now, there are hundreds and thousands of ways to eat, and hundreds and thousands of ways to dress. Moreover, we must constantly eat better and dress better. Isn't this becoming more and more detailed?

    Humanity is the same in the struggle to achieve social progress and in the struggle against nature. For example, in production, we started with drilling wood to make fire, then grinding stones to make axes, knitting nets to make plows, and then machines appeared, all the way to the current electrification and mechanization. We must also develop in a more advanced direction. Isn't this also becoming more and more detailed?

    There is a principle in dialectics: the development of things is constantly advancing, constantly rising, from simple to complex, from low-level to high-level. I think this also contains the principle that things become more and more detailed.

    In the past, we engaged in armed struggle. At that time, the main thing was fighting, and we fought more and more meticulously. There were all kinds of fighting methods, and as a result, we defeated the reactionaries. Now we are engaged in socialist construction, which is fighting against nature, and we must also fight more and more meticulously and constantly achieve victories. The construction in the nine years or more since liberation has become more detailed year by year. Last year, we had a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, which is the result of becoming more and more detailed.

    However, the detail we are talking about is only from a relative point of view. We must know that rough and detailed are both opposing and unified. There is detail because there is rough, and there is rough because there is detail. Therefore, a thing is always rough in the detailed and detailed in the rough. When starting to do something, it is always relatively rough, and it will gradually become detailed. It is said that there is a method of raising pigs, which is to first feed them thin food to let the pigs grow a frame. When the frame grows big, then feed them thick food to let the meat grow in this big frame, so that big and fat pigs can be raised. It seems that the pig farmers understand the principle of having both rough and detailed. Drawing pictures is also like this: first draw the outline, then draw the details. Isn't our construction the same? We have been engaged in construction for nine years, and in a sense, it is basically still building a frame, although we strive to make it as detailed as possible when building the frame. Now, as we gain richer and richer experience every day, we have the possibility and should do economic work more meticulously and deeply than in the past.

    We must not only become more and more detailed, but also mobilize the masses to use their brains and come up with thousands of plans, and be as detailed as possible. Economic construction work is very complex, with many interconnections, and many of them are unfamiliar or not very familiar to us in the past. Therefore, we must delve into it, not be afraid of its complexity, and study and analyze it in many ways. If there are problems, we will solve them, seek detail in the rough, and seek more detail in the detailed. Our experience will become richer and more complete, and our work will become better and better.

### 说“细”

    说“细”
    王文涛
    事情愈做愈细，这也是一个客观规律。随便举个例子来说吧，例如吃饭穿衣，开始人吃树皮草根，生吞活剥野兽，穿树叶兽皮，后来种庄稼，吃粮食，纺线织布，到如今吃饭也有百种千种的方法，穿衣也有百种千种的方法，而且还要不断吃得更好、穿得更好，这不是愈来愈细了吗？
    人类在求得社会进步的斗争中、在向自然进行斗争中也是如此。例如搞生产，开始是钻木取火，后来磨石作斧，结网制犁，再后来出现了机器，一直到现在的电气化、机械化，还要向更进步的方面发展，这不也是愈来愈细吗？
    辩证法里有一条：事物的发展是不断前进，不断上升，由简单到复杂，由低级到高级，我看这也含有事情愈做愈细这个道理。
    过去我们进行武装斗争，那时主要是打仗，我们打仗就是愈打愈细，有各种各样的打法，结果打败了反动派。现在我们搞社会主义建设，这是同自然作战，也是要愈打愈细，不断取得胜利。解放以后的这九年多以来的建设，一年比一年更细，到了去年，我们在工农业生产上来了一个大跃进，这就是愈做愈细的结果。
    但是，我们所说的这种细，只是从相对的意义上去讲。要知道粗和细是一个既对立又统一的东西，有粗才有细，有细才有粗。所以一件事情，总是粗中有细、细中有粗。在开始搞一件事情的时候，总会比较地粗一些，逐步才会细起来。据说养猪有一个方法，就是先给它吃稀的，叫猪长身架，身架长的大大的，以后再给它吃稠的，让肉长在这大架子之中，这样就能喂出又大又肥的猪，看来喂猪人很懂得有粗有细的道理。画图画也是这样，先画轮廓，再画详图。我们搞建设何尝不是如此，我们搞了九年的建设，在某种意义上来说，基本上还是搭架子，虽然我们搭架子时也力求其细一点。到了现在，在一天天取得更丰富的经验的同时，我们已经有可能、也应该把经济工作做得比过去更细致更深入了。
    我们不但要愈做愈细，而且还要发动群众开动脑筋，想出千计万策，能做多细就做多细。搞经济建设工作是很复杂的，彼此互相牵连很多，其中有许多是我们过去不熟悉或不甚熟悉的，因此我们就必须钻进去，不怕它复杂，多方面的研究它，分析它，有问题就解决，在粗中求细，细益求细，我们的经验也就会愈来愈丰富，愈来愈完备，我们的工作也就愈来愈好。
