    Wholeheartedly Serving Passengers
    Beijing Public Bus Company
    Our company, in order to allow all the people of the city to celebrate the Spring Festival with joy, all conductors, repair workers, and cadres are working intensively on various preparations.

    It is estimated that during this year's Spring Festival, the number of public bus passengers will be around 1.5 million per day, an increase of 25% compared to a normal holiday. In order to rapidly transport passengers and shorten their waiting time, we will vigorously organize official vehicles, dispatch training vehicles, rush to produce trailers, and strengthen the maintenance of existing vehicles to ensure that all vehicles are put into operation during the Spring Festival. This will allow us to deploy approximately 15% more vehicles than on a normal holiday. At the same time, we are also preparing to improve dispatching methods based on passenger flow patterns to fully leverage the transportation efficiency of the vehicles.

    Based on the needs of passengers during the Spring Festival and the existing transportation capacity, in terms of vehicle usage, we will balance transportation capacity and make unified arrangements in the spirit of prioritizing suburban areas over urban areas, and key areas over general areas. On the day before the holiday, we will increase the number of vehicles on routes to suburban areas such as Shijingshan, Nanyuan, Tongxian, and Changxindian to ensure the rapid transportation of passengers returning home for the festival. On the day before the end of the holiday, we will ensure that passengers are safely and smoothly transported to their work places. From the first to the fourth day of the Lunar New Year, we will increase the number of vehicles in the city center and on routes to tourist areas such as the Forbidden City, Beihai Park, and the Summer Palace, and add short-distance, express, and direct buses. At the same time, command centers will be established at major stations and distribution points to uniformly allocate and direct vehicles, flexibly dispatch them according to changes in passenger flow, and shorten passenger waiting times as much as possible.

    During the Spring Festival period, the routes to and from the Yongdingmen Railway Station will see an increase in the number of passengers getting on and off trains. We are also prepared to increase the number of trips accordingly based on the arrival and departure times of the trains, so that passengers taking trains can arrive at the station on time, and people returning to Beijing for reunions can have buses to ride late at night. In addition, during the Spring Festival, the operating hours of some major routes in the city will be appropriately extended to solve the transportation problems of people visiting relatives and friends or returning from evening gatherings.

    The conductors have put forward the slogan "Wholeheartedly Serving Passengers, Not Disconnecting During the Spring Festival" to further launch a safe service campaign. We will ensure safe driving, attentive service, and a friendly attitude, so that passengers feel happy. To achieve the above requirements, many new conductors are familiarizing themselves with the geographical environment of their routes, accelerating their learning of promotional language, rapid ticket sales, and other business knowledge, and exchanging experiences to ensure that no mistakes are made during the Spring Festival.

    Cadres at all levels of the company will also participate in platform service to ensure the successful completion of the Spring Festival transportation tasks.

    一心为乘客
    北京市公共汽车公司
    我们公司为了让全市人民欢天喜地过春节，全体乘务员，保修工和干部正紧张地进行着各项准备工作。
    今年春节期间，预计公共汽车的乘客人数，每天将有一百五十万人左右，比一般假日增长25％。为了迅速输送乘客，缩短乘客的候车时间，我们将大力组织机关车、出动教练车、赶制拖车，并对现有车辆加强保养，以保证全部车辆在春节期间投入运输。这样就可以比一般假日多出车15％左右。同时我们还准备根据客流动向，改进调度方法，充分发挥车辆的运输效率。
    根据春节期间乘客的需要和现有的运力条件，在车辆使用上，将根据先郊区后市区，先重点后一般的精神，平衡运力，统一安排。放假的前一日，增加通往石景山、南苑、通县、长辛店等郊区路线上的车辆，保证迅速输送乘客回家过节，假满的前一天，保证把乘客安全顺利地送到工作岗位。夏历初一到初四，则增加市中心和通往故宫、北海、颐和园等一些游览区路线上的车辆，加开区间车、快车、直达车。同时，在各大站和集散点还设立指挥部，统一调配指挥车辆，根据客流变化、灵活调度，尽量缩短乘客的候车时间。
    春节前后通往永定门火车站的路线，因为上下火车的乘客增多，也准备根据火车到达和开出时间，相应的增加车次，让搭乘火车的旅客准时到达车站，让回京团聚的人们深夜有车可乘。此外，春节期间，在市区一些主要路线的营业时间将适当延长，以解决人们探亲会友、晚会归来的交通问题。
    乘务人员们提出了“一心为乘客、春节不下马”的口号，进一步掀起安全服务运动。保证做到：安全驾驶、服务周到，态度和蔼，使乘客感到心情愉快。为了达到上述要求，很多新的乘务人员正在熟习本路线地理环境，加速学习宣传用语、快速售票等各种业务知识，互相交流经验，保证春节期间不出差错。
    全公司各级干部，也都将参加站台服务，以保证春节运输任务的胜利完成。
