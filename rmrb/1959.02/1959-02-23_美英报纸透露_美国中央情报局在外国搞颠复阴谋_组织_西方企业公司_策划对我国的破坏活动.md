Xinhua News Agency, London, February 23rd: American and British newspapers have recently reported in detail on the dirty tricks of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in continuing to subvert China and other countries.

A recent article by Stewart Alsop published in the American "Saturday Evening Post" revealed that the CIA established an organization called "Western Enterprises Corporation" in the coastal areas of China. This organization, for destructive purposes, planned "raids and guerrilla attacks on the mainland," with "strength sometimes reaching a battalion." This organization included Kuomintang agents and hired American officers, while supplies, training, funding, and transportation were provided by the CIA. The American magazine said that its activities played a major role in creating last year's Quemoy (Kinmen) crisis.

According to the British Sunday newspaper "Reynold's News," the CIA is one of the most important decision-making bodies in the United States. Its annual budget is believed to be around $800 million. It is estimated to have a total of 16,000 employees at home and abroad, many of whom are foreigners.

Since Dulles became Secretary of State, the CIA has had a significant influence on the formulation of American foreign policy. It has staff in all US embassies in major countries. It commands all spy groups, operating inside the Soviet Union or on the Soviet border. It releases radio-equipped aircraft to listen to the movements of Soviet troops, aircraft, and ships.

The CIA participated in the overthrow of the Mossadegh regime in Iran and the overthrow of Guatemalan President Arbenz in 1954. In 1956, it built underground tunnels in East Berlin to eavesdrop on telephone and telegraph communications, and dispatched intelligence commando teams into Eastern Europe to distribute counterfeit currency, forged passports, and so on.

    美英报纸透露
    美国中央情报局在外国搞颠复阴谋
    组织“西方企业公司”策划对我国的破坏活动
    新华社伦敦23日电　美英报纸最近详细报道了美国中央情报局继续进行颠复中国和其他国家的肮脏勾当。
    美国“星期六晚邮报”刊载的斯图尔特·艾尔索普最近写的一篇文章揭露，中央情报局在中国沿海一带建立了一个名叫“西方企业公司”的组织，这个组织为了破坏性目的，策划“对大陆进行突击式游击袭击”，“实力有时达到一营人之多”。这个组织包括有国民党特务和受雇的美国军官，而供应、训练、经费和运输则由中央情报局提供。这家美国杂志说，它的活动在制造去年的金门危机方面起过很大作用。
    据英国星期日报纸“雷诺新闻”说，中央情报局是美国最重要的决策机构之一。据认为，它的年度预算达八亿美元左右。估计在国内外共有一万六千名工作人员，其中有许多是外国人。
    自从杜勒斯就任国务卿以来，中央情报局对美国外交政策的制订具有重大影响。它在所有驻在主要国家的美国大使馆都派有工作人员。它指挥一切间谍小组，在苏联国内或在苏联边境上进行活动。它放出有无线电装备的飞机侦听苏联军队、飞机和舰只移动的情况。
    中央情报局参与了推翻伊朗摩萨台政权和在1954年推翻危地马拉总统阿本斯的行动。在1956年在东柏林地下修筑隧道偷听电话和电报，并且派遣情报突击队进入东欧散发伪币、伪护照等等。
