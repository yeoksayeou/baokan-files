A song of triumph
By our reporter Zhang Jing

The young Wangting Power Plant is like a vigorous steed. Full of vitality, it gallops forward in the ranks of the many new power plants of the motherland. As we remember, in the fervent year of 1958, it wrote a magnificent poem for its newborn first year with the miracle of installing a 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator in thirty-five hours. And now, as people have just opened the new calendar of 1959, it has presented the motherland's electric power industry with a generous gift in the form of outstanding achievements.

            A Moment of Happiness
January 11, 1959, 6:48 PM, this was an unforgettable moment! The newly installed 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator began to start up. The young men climbed onto the turbine, using feather dusters and cloths to wipe the machine body until it was spotless, and the various instruments were polished until they shone brightly. As soon as the machine started, the shaft wheels spun rapidly, and the pointer on the speed meter rose from five hundred, one thousand... all the way to three thousand revolutions, and the mercury column on the vacuum mercury gauge also rose slowly. This indicated that everything was normal and met the excellent standard. The experts, workers, technicians, and engineers present listened to the even rumbling sound from inside the machine and couldn't help but smile, their brows revealing irrepressible joy. This was a moment of happiness! The fatigue of so many days vanished at this moment.

      Broadcast it Again
Installing a 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator was a first for the Wangting Power Plant. The Hungarian-made motor had been delivered to the factory for less than a week, and people had not had time to familiarize themselves with it before the installation work began. More than two hundred workers and technicians fought for seven days, overcame numerous difficulties, and finally achieved victory.

Unfortunately, I did not witness the moving scene of this battle firsthand. The factory newspaper editor only gave me a few broadcast scripts from that time. Alright! Let the broadcaster tell us a few more paragraphs:

      "This morning, before dawn, when installing the lower cylinder and condenser neck, it was discovered that the screw holes were misaligned and needed to be re-enlarged. The welding team leader immediately took action, and in the sub-zero seven-degree weather, their fingers were numb with cold, but their hearts were as hot as welding sparks. They sat on the ground, bending their backs, and cut for a full fifty minutes..."

    "Look! How closely the crane operators are cooperating. Whatever the construction site needs, the crane lifts it over. Master worker Miao Baotian has not left the site for four days and four nights, and he personally handles the lifting of important parts..."

      "Where is the general commander of the installation? Are you asking about Comrade Zhou Xiuyi? He has not left the site since the installation began. Today is the final battle, and the machine will undergo a comprehensive inspection and test. Now, Comrade Zhou Xiuyi is working with the experts, holding candles and crawling under the turbine to 'catch leaks'."

If it were not for the limited space, I would really like to have the broadcaster tell the moving stories of all two hundred people.

This 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator seemed to have a magical power, attracting the full energy of many people to it, making people think only of it and forget about themselves. Why is this? A worker put it well: With equipment, we must install it quickly and generate electricity quickly, otherwise, how can we be "pioneers"? People regard "pioneers" as a glorious title bestowed upon them. They all understand very well that the construction of the motherland requires a large amount of electricity, and winning time is victory! In this way, the turbine that used to take three months to install is now installed in seven days.

            "Joint Celebration"
On the installation site, people would see a brown-haired, lanky man in a blue cotton-padded coat every day. One moment he would be squatting on the ground with the engineers, gesturing, and the next he would be working with the workers to assemble and disassemble various machine parts. He was Comrade Liptak, a Hungarian expert.

From the beginning of the installation, Comrade Liptak put a bed in the office and slept there with the factory director and engineers. During the day he guided on the site, and at night he would get up and go to the construction site after only a few hours of sleep. Whenever there was a problem, he always listened humbly to the opinions of the workers and engineers, and then everyone would discuss and solve it. He was particularly concerned about small problems that everyone did not pay attention to. He often stood alone next to the machine or pipeline, and if he found a problem, he would take it apart and reassemble it himself. Once, when the oil pressure was adjusted too low, he and everyone else crawled under the turbine, and when he came out, his clothes were covered in oil stains.

On the night of the startup, he and several other Hungarian experts rushed over. As soon as they arrived on the scene, they immediately took off their woolen coats, worked nimbly in their shirtsleeves. That night, he and the workers happily stayed by the turbine. Director Xu brought a camera and took a "joint celebration" photo with him and everyone present. This "joint celebration" photo and this rumbling steam turbine generator will keep the valuable friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people forever in people's hearts.

            Young Men
Many young men participated in this installation, many of whom only entered the factory in September last year. Before entering the factory, they had never seen a machine, and they didn't even know what pliers looked like. The factory put them in the workshop, one person following one master worker, watching, doing, and learning. In just three months, they have been able to do some work independently. Wang Zhaoteng, who came from Binhai County, always missed home when he first arrived. The workshop director found him a good master, patiently teaching him technology and how to be a worker. Now, Wang Zhaoteng is already able to install pipelines independently, and some of his work is almost as good as his master's. He has participated in two installations in the three months since he entered the factory, and at the end of last year, he even went to Shanghai to help others install. I asked him, do you still miss home now? He shook his head and said naively, "I don't anymore, you couldn't carry me away in a fancy sedan." Someone also told me about a little girl. This girl is called Yu Guohua, and she is fifteen or sixteen years old this year. When she first arrived, she asked to learn welding, but people thought she was too young. This girl is very stubborn and insists on learning this skill. She picked up the welding torch and worked hard; now, hey! She has become an outstanding apprentice.

Young people like this, full of vitality, make up almost half of the workers at the Wangting Power Plant. The factory director told me not to underestimate them, in another two years, they will become the backbone of the factory!

      New Year's Eve
The workers will always remember that the successful installation of this 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator, quickly and well, was also due to the care and support of many brother factories. These include Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant, Zhabei Power Plant, Changzhou Qishuyan Power Plant, and Shanghai Turbine Factory...

Engineer Zhou Xiuyi told me a story with gratitude. This story began on New Year's Eve in 1958.

At that time, the installation engineering department was in the tense preparation stage. On New Year's Eve, it was discovered that the high-pressure cylinder joint surface was uneven and had to be processed before it could be installed. This cylinder, which is 2.8 meters in diameter, cannot be machined without a large boring machine. Where would this small Wangting town find such a large machine? That night, the Party committee secretary personally took eight workers and master workers, using a four-ton truck, to transport this big guy to the Shanghai Turbine Factory for help.

It was New Year's Day, and all the factories in Shanghai were closed. The car drove into the Shanghai Turbine Factory, which was deserted, and no one could be found anywhere. The Party committee secretary finally found the factory director and chief engineer and explained his intentions. They immediately agreed to help and warmly arranged for the guests' food and lodging. Early the next morning, the workshop director rode his bicycle everywhere to help them find people, and finally found the workshop foreman and master workers. From eight o'clock in the morning to two o'clock in the afternoon, the workshop director did not leave, helping to come up with ideas and solve difficulties. After the processing was completed, they also helped them load it onto the truck, and only left the factory to go home after watching the car drive away.

Now, this 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator has begun to transmit a powerful current to the Shanghai-Nanjing area. It lies majestically on the platform, facing the rising sun of the new spring of 1959, singing the song of victory non-stop! (Attached picture)

    凯歌一曲
    本报记者　张竞
    年轻的望亭发电厂，像一匹矫健的骏马。它全身充满活力，在祖国许多新建电厂的行列里奔腾前进。曾记得，在那沸腾的1958年，它用三十五小时安装一部六千瓩汽轮发电机的奇迹，给自己新生的第一个年头，写下了壮丽的诗篇；而今，当人们刚掀开1959年的新日历，它又以优异的成就，给祖国的电力工业献上了一份厚礼。
            幸福的时刻
    1959年1月11日下午六时四十八分，这是一个难忘的时刻！新安装起来的二万五千瓩的汽轮发电机，开始启动了。小伙子们爬上汽机，用鸡毛帚和揩布把机身上揩得一尘不染，各式各样的仪表也擦得金光闪亮。机器一开动，轴轮就飞快地转动起来，转速仪表的指针，从五百、一千……一直到三千转，真空水银表上的水银柱也缓缓上升。这表示，一切都很正常，一切都合乎优良的标准。在场的专家、工人、技术员和工程师们，倾听着机器里发出的均匀的隆隆声，都情不自禁地笑了，眉宇之间，流露着压抑不住的喜悦。这是幸福的时刻！多少天的劳累在这个时刻里都烟消云散了。
      再广播一次
    安装二万五千瓩的汽轮发电机，对望亭电厂来说，还是第一次。这部匈牙利出产的电机运到厂里还不到一个星期，人们还来不及熟悉它，就开始了安装工作。二百多个工人和技术人员整整战斗了七天，克服了重重困难，终于取得了胜利。
    很可惜，我没有亲眼看到这场战斗的动人场面。厂报的编辑只给了我几份当时的广播稿。好吧！就让广播员再给我们讲几段吧：
      “今天早上，天还麻花亮，安装下汽缸和凝结器的头颈时，发现了螺丝眼子对不准，需要重新割大眼子。电焊班长马上亲自动手，在零下七度的寒天里，他们的手指冻得发痛，可是他们的心，却像电焊火花一样的炽热。他们坐在地上，弯着腰背，整整割了五十分钟……”
    “瞧！起重工配合得多么密切。工地上要什么，天车就吊来了什么。缪宝田老师傅已经四天四夜没有离开现场了，只要是起吊重要机件，他都亲自动手。……”
      “安装的总指挥在哪里？是问周修翼同志吗？他从安装开始就没有离开过现场。今天是最后一场战斗，机器将要经历一次全面的检查和试验。现在，周修翼同志又和专家一起，拿着蜡烛钻到汽机底下‘捉漏风’去了。”
    如果不是篇幅有限，真想把二百多个人的动人事迹都请广播员讲一讲。
    这部二万五千瓩的汽轮发电机仿佛有一种魔力，把许多人的全副精力都吸引到它身上，使人们只惦记着它，而忘记了自己。这是为什么呢？有个工人说得好：有了设备，就得快安装，快发电，不这样，哪像个“先行官”？人们把“先行官”当成是给自己的光荣封号。他们都非常明白，祖国的建设需要大量的电力，赢得时间就是胜利！就这样，过去需要三个月才能安装起的汽轮机，现在他们七天就安装成功了。
            “合场欢”
    在安装工地上，人们天天都会看见一个棕色头发、瘦长个子，穿着蓝布棉衣的人。他一会儿和工程师们蹲在地上比划，一会儿又和工人在一齐装拆各种机件。他，就是匈牙利专家利普特同志。
    从安装开始，利普特同志就在办公室里搁了一个床铺，和厂长、工程师一样，睡在办公室里。白天他在现场指导，夜里睡不到几个钟头，又爬起来到工地去了。出了什么问题，他总是虚心地倾听工人和工程师的意见，然后大家商量着解决。对大家不注意的细小问题，他却特别关心。他常常一个人站在机器或管道旁边，发现有毛病，就自己动手拆下来，重新装好。有一次调整油压低了，他也和大家一道在汽机下面钻来钻去，出来时，一身衣服都弄得油污斑斑。
    开车的那天晚上，他又和好几个匈牙利专家赶来了。一到现场，立刻把呢大衣脱了，穿着一身单衣，敏捷地工作起来。这天晚上，他和工人们一道心情愉快地守在汽机旁边，徐厂长拿来了一只照相机，给他和在场的所有的人合摄了一张“合场欢”。这张“合场欢”和这一部隆隆震响的汽轮发电机，将使中匈两国人民可贵的友谊，永远留在人们的心里。
            小伙子们
    参加这次安装的，有不少年青的小伙子们，其中有不少是去年9月才进厂的。进厂前，他们没有见过机器，甚至连老虎钳是什么样子也不知道。厂里把他们放到车间里，一个人跟一个老师傅，边看边做边学。短短的三个月，他们已经能单独地做一些活了。从滨海县中来的王兆腾，刚来时，老是想家。车间主任给他找了一个好师傅，耐心地教他学技术，学做一个工人。现在，王兆腾已经能够单独安装管道了，有的活做得简直跟师傅差不多。他进厂三个月，已经参加了两次安装，去年年底还跟着到上海去帮人家安装哩。我问他，现在还想家吗？他摇摇头，憨里憨气地说：“不想了，用大花轿也抬不走了。”有人还跟我讲了一个小姑娘的事。这个姑娘叫于国华，今年有十五、六岁。刚来时，她要求学电焊，人家嫌她年纪太小。这姑娘很倔强，偏要学会这套本领，她拿起电焊龙头猛干起来；现在，嘿！她成了学工中很出色的一个。
    像这样生龙活虎的年青人，在望亭电厂的工人中几乎占了一大半。厂长告诉我，别小看了他们，再过两年，他们就成了工厂的骨干啦！
      除夕之夜
    工人们永远记得，这部二万五千瓩的汽轮发电机能够又快又好地安装成功，还亏得许多兄弟工厂的关怀和支援。这里有上海杨树浦发电厂、闸北电厂、常州戚墅堰电厂和上海汽轮机厂……。
    工程师周修翼同志满怀感激的心情，给我讲了一个故事。这故事开始发生在1958年除夕的夜晚。
    那时，安装工程处正在紧张准备阶段。除夕这天，发现高压汽缸接合面不平，一定要加工后才能安装。这个直径二点八公尺的汽缸，没有大型的镗床是啃不动的。小小的望亭镇，哪有这种大机器呢？当夜，党委书记便亲自带了八个工人和老师傅，用四吨大卡车，把这个大家伙运到上海汽轮机厂去求援。
    这天是元旦，上海所有的工厂都休假了，汽车开进了汽轮机厂，冷冷清清的，到处找不到人。党委书记好容易找到了厂长和总工程师，向他们说明了来意。他们马上就答应帮忙，并且热情地安排客人的食宿。第二天一早，车间主任就骑了自行车到处帮他们找人，终于找来了车间的工段长和老师傅。从早晨八点钟到下午两点钟，车间主任一步也没有离开，帮着出主意，解决困难。加工完成后，又动手帮他们运上汽车，看着汽车远去后，才离开工厂回家去。
    现在，这部二万五千瓩的汽轮发电机，已经开始向沪宁地区输送出强大的电流。它气势轩昂地横卧在平台上，迎着1959年新春的朝霞，永不停息地唱着胜利的凯歌！（附图片）
