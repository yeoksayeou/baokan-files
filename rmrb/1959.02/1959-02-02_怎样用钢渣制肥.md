Xinhua News Agency: The Wuyang County Agricultural Science Institute in Henan Province has recently successfully developed a steel slag phosphate fertilizer, made from the slag produced during steelmaking.

    The specific method for making steel slag phosphate fertilizer is as follows: Set up a water tank next to the steelmaking furnace, so that the slag on the surface of the molten steel in the furnace flows into the water tank to cool down. Hot steel slag crumbles when immersed in cold water, making it easy to process. The slag often contains some iron, so choose black-brown steel slag that looks like glass, and remove iron and impurities to improve the fertilizer's composition and make it easier to crush. Grind the slag crushed in the water tank with a stone roller or crush it with a hammer into a powder, and then sieve it.
    When applying steel slag phosphate fertilizer, first mix it with ten to thirty times the amount of compost or cow dung, add a small amount of water, ferment for half a month, and then use it. Apply 100 to 500 jin per mu.

Xinhua News Agency: Shijingshan People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing utilizes the steel slag left over from steelmaking at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company every day to make fertilizer.

    The method used by the Shijingshan People's Commune Steel Slag Phosphate Fertilizer Factory to produce steel slag fertilizer is: first smash the steel slag into small pieces, then grind it into powder, and finally screen it. This people's commune is planning to modify electric grinders, rotary screens, and stone crushers to produce steel slag fertilizer on a large scale. According to the appraisal by the Soil and Fertilizer Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, this steel slag fertilizer contains 1% to 2% phosphorus, 2% to 7% magnesium, and about 4% manganese. This fertilizer is suitable for acidic and neutral soils and can make wheat stalks strong and grains full.

    怎样用钢渣制肥
    据新华社讯　河南舞阳县农业科学研究所最近试制成功了一种钢渣磷钙肥，这种肥料是用炼钢时出的浮渣制成的。
    钢渣磷钙肥的具体制法是：在炼钢炉旁设一个水槽，使炉内钢水表层的浮渣流到水槽内冷却。热钢渣浸入冷水就变碎，容易加工。浮渣里往往带有一些铁质，因此要选择像玻璃一样的黑褐色的钢渣，除去铁、杂质，这样肥料的成分才好，也容易碾碎。在水槽里泡碎的钢渣用石碾碾细，或用铁锤打碎，碾成粉末，再过筛就成了。
    施用钢渣磷钙肥，要先同十倍到三十倍的堆肥、牛粪掺匀，加少量的水，发酵半个月，然后使用，每亩可施一百至五百斤。
    据新华社讯　北京郊区石景山人民公社利用石景山钢铁公司每天出钢后剩下的钢渣制造肥料。
    石景山人民公社钢渣磷肥厂制作钢渣肥料的方法是：先将钢渣砸成碎块，然后再碾成粉面，最后经过筛选便制成了。这个人民公社为了大量生产钢渣肥料，现正计划改装电碾、滚筛和碎石机等。这里的钢渣肥料，经中国农业科学院土壤肥料研究所的鉴定，证实其中含磷1％—2％，镁2％—7％，锰4％左右。这种肥料适用于酸性和中性土质，可使麦秆粗壮和子粒饱满。
