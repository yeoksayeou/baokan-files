Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, February 11th: Iraqi Prime Minister Qassem reaffirmed tonight that Iraq is firmly committed to a policy of active neutrality. This means: fight against enemies and be friendly to friends.

Qassem said that Iraq has no alliances or allies anywhere in any form. He said: "We have replaced alliances with friendship."

Qassem reiterated that Iraq's policy is based on protecting national sovereignty and complete unity and full cooperation with Arab countries. He emphasized that Iraq's policy is "in the interests of the people" and "we will never deviate from this policy."

Qassem told reporters that Iraq's position is very stable and its strength is increasing. Iraq's "confidence in consolidating our republic and defending our fruits is also increasing." He said, "From the revolution until today, we have been in a precarious situation. But now Iraq is able to protect itself against any danger. Our army is very strong, but we are still continuing to strengthen our army."

The Prime Minister said that the Iraqi army was controlled by a minority in the old regime, but now it is controlled and guided by the people and used to protect the people.

The Prime Minister talked about his past statement that Iraq would have a revolution every month. He said: "In the coming month, you will see many revolutions that will stabilize our republic and consolidate our sovereignty." The Prime Minister said that Iraq is now in charge of its own affairs.

Prime Minister Qassem asked reporters to abide by one thing: "If you hear or read any newspapers from other Arab countries attacking me, please do not reply to them, because they will apologize one day." The Prime Minister emphasized that he is concerned about the interests of all Arab countries, especially the interests of Iraq, and therefore, "I am not bothered by attacks, because they will never affect us."

The Prime Minister stated definitively that Iraq will help defend and recover any looted places. He said that Algeria has received aid from the Republic of Iraq in the past and now. If the situation permits, he would personally volunteer to defend Algeria.

Qassem believes that newspapers are schools that "educate the people" and "spokespersons for the people." The Prime Minister expressed his happiness at the increase in the number of newspapers and hopes that more newspapers can be published, because "an increase in the number of newspapers means an increase in people's awareness. Our goal is not to isolate the people from political and other happenings."

Prime Minister Qassem reiterated his belief in freedom of the press and drew everyone's attention to the fact that he has never closed any newspapers, "In my life, I will never do that, because I believe in freedom of the press." He also assured them that he would treat them equally.

The Prime Minister asked reporters to strengthen unity and never create discord, because "imperialists and foreigners cannot work except by sowing discord." The Prime Minister also asked the newspapers to tell him about any mistakes he might make, so that "I can work for you and the sons of the people."

In answering a question about the execution dates of those sentenced to death by the military court, the Prime Minister said, "In the history of our revolution, we have always issued several reports before setting the dates of the revolution. Among those sentenced to death, some may be connected with some events or other cases." He believes that "patience and calmness can guarantee the public interest."

Speaking about the Baghdad Pact, the Prime Minister said: "The solution we will achieve will safeguard our country's interests, and the result will be satisfactory."

    卡塞姆总理重申
    伊拉克坚守积极中立
    同敌人作斗争同朋友们友好
    新华社巴格达11日电　伊拉克总理卡塞姆今天晚上重申伊拉克坚定地奉行积极的中立主义政策。这就是：同敌人作斗争，同朋友们友好。
    卡塞姆说，伊拉克没有在任何地方有任何形式的联盟或盟国。他说：“我们用友谊代替了联盟。”
    卡塞姆重申，伊拉克的政策是以保护国家的主权和同阿拉伯各国完全团结和充分合作为基础的。他强调指出，伊拉克的这种政策是“出于人民的利益的”，“我们永远不会脱离这一政策”。
    卡塞姆向新闻记者们说，伊拉克的地位很稳固，它的力量正在加强。伊拉克“巩固我们共和国和保卫我们的果实的自信心也在加强”。他说，“从革命以后到今天为止，我们一直处在不牢靠的境地。但是现在伊拉克能够保护自己对付任何危险。我们的军队已经十分强大，但是我们仍在继续加强我们的军队。”
    总理说，伊拉克军队在旧政权时代是受少数人控制的，现在则受人民的控制和指导，用来保护人民。
    总理谈到了他过去说的伊拉克每个月将有一次革命的说法。他说：“在下个月，你们将看到许多次革命，它们将稳定我们的共和国，巩固我们的主权。”总理说，伊拉克现在由它自己来当家作主。
    卡塞姆总理要求记者们遵守一件事情：“如果你们听到或读到任何其它阿拉伯国家报纸攻击我，请不要答复它们，因为它们总有一天要道歉的。”总理强调指出，他对于所有阿拉伯国家的利益，特别是伊拉克的利益感到关心，因此，“我并不因为受到攻击而烦恼，因为它们决不会影响我们。”
    总理肯定地表示，伊拉克将帮助守住和收复任何遭到掠夺的地方。他说，阿尔及利亚过去和现在都从伊拉克共和国得到援助。如果情况便利，他还会亲自志愿去保卫阿尔及利亚。
    卡塞姆认为，报纸是“教育人民”的学校和“人民的代言人”。总理表示他对报纸数目的增加感到高兴，并且希望能够出版更多的报纸，因为“报纸数目的增加意味着人民觉悟的提高。我们的目的不是要使人民同政治和其他方面发生的事情隔绝起来”。
    卡塞姆总理重申他对新闻自由的信念，并且提请大家注意这种情况：他从没有封闭过任何报纸，“在我这辈子，我决不会这样做，因为我相信新闻自由。”他还保证对他们一视同仁。
    总理要求记者们加强团结，决不要产生不和，因为“帝国主义者和外国人除了挑拨离间以外就没法工作。”总理还要求各报把他可能犯的错误告诉他，这样，“我就可以为你们和人民的儿子工作。”
    在答复关于被军事法庭判死刑的那几个人的服刑日期问题时，总理说：“在我们的革命史上，我们一向是先发表几个报告，然后才规定革命的日期的。被判死刑的人中，有一些可能同一些事件或其他案件有联系。”他认为，“忍耐和沉着的做法可以保证公众的利益。”
    谈到关于巴格达条约的问题，总理说：“我们将取得的解决办法将维护我国的利益，结果将是令人满意的。”
