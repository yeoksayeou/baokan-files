Shanghai, February 24th (Our Dispatch) The state-owned Shanghai Fifth Printing and Dyeing Factory, in implementing the "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations" system, has been piloting a system since November of last year where factory-level cadres regularly "become soldiers" and some workers and cadres in workshops regularly rotate. The results have been excellent. These two new methods have developed from the factory's past practice of cadres deeply participating in production labor during regular work and workers participating in group management.

After the Rectification Campaign, the Fifth Printing and Dyeing Factory gradually implemented systems such as cadres participating in labor for one to one and a half days per week, and workers participating in group management work, which achieved certain results. However, there were still some problems. For example, when cadres were busy with work, the time spent participating in labor could not be guaranteed; some cadres inevitably still engaged in bossing people around when they were laboring. On the workers' side, due to only participating in group management work, the feelings of inferiority about doing a good job in management had not been completely eliminated.

The factory Party committee studied these situations, and in order to further implement and develop the experience of "Two Participations, One Reform, and Three Combinations," it was decided that, starting in November of last year, in addition to continuing to implement the original system, factory-level cadres would adopt the method of "going down to the company as soldiers" and work as workers in groups for a certain period; in the workshops, qualified workers and cadres would be selected for regular rotation. The first batch of people to go down as workers included factory director Yang Donglin, and some engineers and pattern designers. The time they spent as workers ranged from one to three months, completely separating themselves from their original business management work, and formally participating in the group's production labor as established staff members; their original work was shared by other factory directors and engineering and technical personnel. In terms of rotation, two workshop directors from the two main workshops of printing and dyeing were assigned to lower levels, and veteran workers with production enthusiasm and certain management experience, Miao Dingguan and Zhu Dasan, were elected by the workers to take over the leadership of the workshop for two months (the factory has eliminated the workshop level, and the workshop is equivalent to the original workshop). Now, the first batch of cadres and workers who went down to "become soldiers" and participate in the rotation have completed their terms and returned to their original positions. Around the Spring Festival, the second batch of cadres who became workers successively went down to the workshops, and the workers who rotated to become cadres took up leadership positions.

The new system has had a great impact on all the workers in the factory. Factory director Yang Donglin, who is over forty years old, went down to the mercerizing team of the bleaching workshop's Group B. Wearing old work clothes, he diligently operated the mercerizing machine, pushed cloth boxes, sewed cloth ends, and swept the floor, constantly busy. Whenever he left his production post, he would ask the group leader for leave; when attending group meetings, he would speak as an ordinary group member. He not only appeared as an ordinary laborer, but also played a model role everywhere. He always came to work early every day to do cleaning and preparation work. He was always the first to arrive at every group meeting. Therefore, the workers were more harmonious with him emotionally. When the factory director was unfamiliar with production, they taught him again and again.

After veteran workers Miao Dingguan and Zhu Dasan participated in the relatively complex workshop management work, they encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for being masters of their own affairs. In the past, some workers thought, "We have a low level, so we can do group management work, but we can't do complex work." The two veteran workers not only managed the workshop work, but also managed it quite well. Their biggest characteristic is that when they encounter difficulties that they cannot solve, they return to their "old home" to consult with the workers, and they are good at considering the masses and following the mass line when dealing with problems. Once, two people were absent from work in the dyeing workshop, and it was too late for temporary scheduling. When Zhu Dasan discussed it with everyone, the workers unanimously "guaranteed" that there would be no problem, and that they could take over the work of the two people, not just for one day, but for a week. The small sink beside the printing machine used for proofing was broken, and soapy water and sulfuric acid were lost, causing waste. The workers were very anxious, but repeated reports to the higher authorities in the past had not resulted in repairs. Miao Dingguan understood the feelings of the masses. After participating in the management of the printing workshop, he repeatedly urged the relevant departments to repair the small sink, and the workers were very happy. Workers were a little unaccustomed to participating in management at first, but after a period of time, they became familiar with it.

The method of factory-level cadres regularly "becoming soldiers" and some workers and cadres in the workshops regularly rotating has also, to some extent, increased mutual understanding between workers and cadres. Pattern designer Ma Youhua used to think that the workers' labor was very "rough" and not as important as his own work of designing patterns. This time, after he went down to the printing workshop to work as a worker, he realized that the workers' labor was very meticulous, the workers' operating experience was very rich, and there were many working methods. Now, his view is different. He believes that the opinions of the workers should be sought when designing patterns for printed cloth; printing workers and slurry mixing workers should be included when the factory reviews the patterns. On the workers' side, due to the limitations of their work positions, some workers in the past only cared about their own production. If they had difficulties, they would find the workshop director, and if they couldn't find them, they would get angry. This time, after the two veteran workers participated in the workshop work, they felt that the cadres' work was indeed very busy, and felt that the cadres had suffered some "unjustified accusations" in the past.

After the printing and dyeing factory tried this method, it further encouraged the enthusiasm of all the staff and workers in the factory, promoted the workers to actively study politics, technology, and management knowledge, and new scenes have emerged in production. The Xu Guang car team of Group B of the bleaching workshop was originally a relatively backward team in the whole factory, but after the factory director went down to the group to work, there was a significant change. Zhang Xuejun, a worker in this group, was relatively backward in the past. The factory director was assigned to the group to be his assistant, and he was very excited, saying that in the past, "money was in command," but now, politics must be in command. Currently, he has transformed into a relatively advanced worker in the group.

The Party committee of this factory has decided that in the future, factory-level cadres such as the Party committee secretary and Party committee members will take turns to go down to work as workers; within the scope of workshops and departments, the number of workers and cadres who are rotated will also be gradually and appropriately expanded, so as to form a regular system.

    上海第五印染厂认真贯彻群众路线
    厂级干部定期“当兵”
    工段中部分工人和干部定期轮换
    本报上海24日电　国营上海第五印染厂在实行“两参一改三结合”中，从去年11月份起，试行厂一级干部定期“当兵”和工段中部分工人与干部定期轮换的办法，效果很好。这两个新办法，是过去这个厂的干部在经常工作中深入参加生产劳动和工人参加小组管理的基础上发展起来的。
    整风以后，第五印染厂逐步实行了干部每周参加一天到一天半的劳动，工人参加小组管理工作等制度，取得了一定的效果。但是其中也还存在一些问题。如干部工作一忙，参加劳动的时间就不能保证；有些干部在劳动时还不免有指手划脚的现象等等。在工人方面，由于只参加了小组管理工作，对作好管理工作的自卑心理还没有完全消除。
    工厂党委会研究了这些情况，为了进一步贯彻执行和发展“两参一改三结合”的经验，确定从去年11月份起，除继续执行原来的制度外，厂一级干部采用“下连当兵”的办法，下小组当一定时期的工人；在工段中，选择有条件的工人和干部实行定期互相轮换。第一批下去当工人的是厂长杨东林，和一部分工程师、图案设计师等。他们当工人的时间分别为一到三个月，完全脱离原来的业务管理工作，正式作为定员参加小组的生产劳动；他们原来的工作由其他的厂长和工程技术人员分工担任。在轮换方面，印花和染色两个主要工段下放两个工段长，由工人推选生产积极、有一定管理经验的老工人缪鼎冠、朱达三，脱产两月担任工段的领导工作（该厂已取消车间一级，工段即相当于原来的车间）。现在，第一批下去“当兵”和参加轮换的干部、工人已经期满，回到原来的工作岗位。春节前后，又有第二批当工人的干部陆续下车间，轮换当干部的工人走上了领导岗位。
    新的制度对全厂工人影响很大。四十多岁的厂长杨东林，下到漂炼工段乙班丝光车小组，身穿旧工作服，勤勤恳恳地在丝光车旁操作，推布箱、缝头子、扫地，忙个不停。一离开生产岗位，便向组长请假；开小组会，以普通组员的身份发言。他不仅以普通劳动者的姿态出现，还处处起模范带头作用。每天总是提早上班，做清洁和准备工作。每次开小组会，总是他第一个到会。因此工人们和他在感情上更加融洽。厂长对生产不熟悉，他们就一遍又一遍地教他。
    老工人缪鼎冠、朱达三参加比较复杂的工段管理工作以后，鼓舞了工人当家作主的积极性。过去，有些工人认为：“我们水平低，搞搞小组的管理工作可以，做复杂的不行。”两位老工人不仅把工段工作管起来了，而且管得还不错。他们最大的特点是，碰到自己不能解决的困难就回“老家”找工人们商量，处理问题善于为群众考虑、走群众路线。有一次，染色工段有两人缺勤，临时调度已来不及，朱达三跟大家一谈，工人就一致打“包票”说：没有问题，两人工作我们担当下来，不要说一天，一个星期也行。印花车旁供打样用的小水槽坏了，肥皂水和硫酸流失，造成浪费，工人很焦急，但过去多次向上面反映也没来修。缪鼎冠理解群众这种心情，在参加印花工段的管理工作后，就一再催促有关部门把小水槽修好了，工人很高兴。工人参加管理开始有些不习惯，经过一段时间，也就摸熟了。
    厂一级干部定期“当兵”、工段中部分工人和干部定期轮换的办法，也在一定程度上增进了工人和干部之间的相互了解。图案设计师马友华，过去认为工人的劳动很“粗”，不如自己设计花样工作的责任重大。这次，他下到印花工段当工人以后，体会到工人的劳动很细致，工人的操作经验很丰富，工作方法很多。现在，他的看法不同了，认为设计花布的花样时，应该征求工人的意见；厂里审查花样时应该吸收印花工人和调浆工人参加。在工人方面，由于工作岗位的局限性，过去也有些工人只管自己生产，有困难就找工段长，找不到就发脾气。这次，两位老工人参加工段工作以后，才感到干部的工作确实很忙，觉得过去干部们吃了一些“冤枉官司”。
    印染厂试行这个办法以后，更加鼓舞了全厂职工的干劲，推动了工人积极学习政治、技术和管理知识，生产上也出现了新的气象。漂炼工段乙班徐光车小组本来是全厂比较落后的小组，厂长下到小组劳动以后有了显著的转变。这个小组的工人张学俊，过去比较落后，厂长下放到小组正好作他的助手，他内心非常激动，表示：过去是“钞票挂帅”，现在一定要政治挂帅。目前，他已经转变为小组内比较先进的工人。
    这个厂的党委会已经确定，今后党委书记、党委委员等厂级干部都将轮流下去当工人；在工段和科室范围内，也将逐步地、适当地扩大工人和干部轮换的人数，以便形成经常的制度。（贺昌华、马立民）
