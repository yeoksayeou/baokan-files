Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 4th. TASS Moscow, January 28th: K.T. Mazurov, Alternate member of the Presidum of the Central Committee of the CPSU and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia, delivered a speech at the morning session of the 21st Congress of the CPSU on January 28th.

Comrade Mazurov said that we, the delegates to the Congress, listened very carefully to the profound and well-reasoned report made by Comrade N.S. Khrushchev on the path and plan for building communism in our country. The seven-year plan for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union is a living and concrete embodiment of Lenin's ideas of building communism in our country, and the 21st Congress of the Party is discussing the control figures of this plan.

Mazurov emphasized that now, as our country has entered a new historical period and entered the period of comprehensively building a communist society, we can clearly see the historically significant achievements of the Soviet people - the workers and fighters who have opened up the path to a bright future for working mankind. Now it is particularly clear to see the wisdom and organizing power of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which mobilized the broadest masses of the people to consciously engage in the historically significant cause of creation, united them and guided them to overcome numerous difficulties and obstacles toward the glorious goal - communism. The guidelines formulated by the 20th Congress of the CPSU, and the practical work of the Party and its Central Committee, have received the enthusiastic support and unanimous endorsement of the working people throughout the country. Only a small factional and splinter group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov opposed the Leninist line of our Party. The crushing of this anti-Party group proved the unbreakable Leninist unity of our Party and promoted the closer unity of our people around the Party and its Central Committee. Our Party and people are now more united and consistent than ever before.

Comrade Mazurov continued that after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the measures implemented by the Central Committee in the Leninist national policy further strengthened the friendship between the various nationalities of our country and promoted the more rapid development of the productive forces of the various republics. There are no more backward border areas in the Soviet Union today. All Soviet national republics have developed industry and large-scale socialist agriculture. All nationalities of the Soviet Union have rich spiritual lives and actively participate in the development of science and technology, creating outstanding cultural wealth.

In pre-revolutionary Belarus, the output of industrial products per capita was only about one-fifth of the average for the whole of Russia. Belarus is now a powerful industrialized country. If calculated on a per capita basis, Belarus is ahead of some of the most developed countries in Western Europe in terms of the output of automobiles, tractors, and metal-cutting machine tools. In the thirteen years since the war, Belarus' industrial output value has increased more than fifteen times, exceeding the pre-war level by nearly two and a half times. Tremendous changes have also taken place in the collective farm countryside.

Great achievements have been made in education and cultural construction. In terms of the proportion of college students per 10,000 residents, the Republic of Belarus is ahead of Western European countries such as France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Austria, Sweden, and Belgium, while before the October Revolution, 80% of Belarusians were illiterate.

Comrade Mazurov talked about the further comprehensive development of Belarus in the economy and culture in the next seven years. During these years, the industrial output value of Belarus will increase by 80%. Grain output will increase by about double compared to 1958, flax fiber and potatoes by 50%, and sugar beet by more than double. The output of meat, fats, and milk per capita will greatly exceed the existing level in the United States. The republic's party organization is now carrying out a socialist competition to double the meat production of collective farms in 1959. The advanced collective farms, state farms, and districts in the republic are striving to complete the seven-year plan tasks in agriculture in four or five years.

Mazurov then talked about some of the suggestions made by the working people of the Republic during the discussion of the control figures for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union. The purpose of these suggestions is to make fuller use of existing potential. The state planning committee's plan stipulates that with a 2.3-fold increase in the generating capacity of turbine power stations, the length of transmission lines should increase by at least double (compared with the past seven years). The construction of transmission lines must be accelerated. When compiling the industrial production plan in the seven-year plan, it is necessary to study the issue of specialization in industry and the relationship of collaboration between various economic zones with extra and special care. Some national economic committees often have to arrange for the production of some parts required by the industry of their own economic zone, even though specialized enterprises in other economic zones are already producing these parts. For the benefit of the country, it is necessary to more boldly unify the specifications of the most important parts and components of our country's machines, especially the most important parts and components of tractors and automobiles. However, the poorly organized specialization of machine manufacturing plants will hinder the design work of unified component specifications.

A large part of Comrade Mazurov's speech was about the tasks of party organizations in striving to complete and overfulfill the tasks of increasing labor productivity and reducing product costs in the seven-year plan. Party organizations should actively oppose mismanagement and waste, strengthen economic accounting, and increase the responsibility of economic leaders for improving all quality indicators of enterprise work.

Comrade Mazurov said that the magnificent program for communist construction in our country in the next seven years not only inspires the Soviet people, but also inspires all the working people of the countries of the socialist camp and our friends all over the world. This program has aroused fear and panic among our class enemies. Imperialists are doing everything possible to weaken the socialist front. They have not given up the "cold war" against the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp and attempt to slander our system and our way of life and distort our policies and our intentions by means of defamation and provocation. However, it is no longer possible for the ideologues of capitalism to conceal the tremendous achievements of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp from the masses of working people.

Comrade Mazurov concluded by saying that the communists of Belarus, the people of Belarus, like all the Soviet people, unanimously support the program of communist construction formulated by the Central Committee of the CPSU, which conforms to the fundamental interests of the working people, enthusiastically support the wise policy of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union reflected in this program, and will dedicate their strength to striving for the victory of communism in our country.

    在苏共二十一次代表大会上
    马祖罗夫的发言
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社莫斯科1月28日讯：苏共中央主席团候补委员、白俄罗斯共产党中央委员会第一书记克·特·马祖罗夫在苏共第二十一次代表大会1月28日上午会议上发了言。
    马祖罗夫同志说，我们，代表大会的代表们，十分注意地听取了尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志所做的关于我国建设共产主义的道路和计划的、论证深刻的报告。苏联发展国民经济的七年计划是列宁的建立共产主义的思想在我国的活生生而具体的体现，党的第二十一次代表大会正在讨论这个计划的控制数字。
    马祖罗夫强调说，现在，当我国已经跨入新的历史时期，进入全面展开共产主义社会建设时期的时候，可以明显地看出苏联人民——为劳动人类开辟通向光明未来的道路的劳动者和战士——建树的具有全世界历史意义的功勋。现在可以特别明显地看出苏联共产党的英明和组织力量，苏联共产党发动了最广大的人民群众去自觉地从事具有历史意义的创造事业，把他们团结起来并引导他们克服重重困难和障碍而走向光辉的目的地——共产主义。苏共第二十次代表大会所制定的方针，党及其中央委员会的实际工作，得到了全国劳动人民的热烈支持和一致拥护。只有马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁、谢皮洛夫这一小撮派别分子和分裂分子集团反对我们党的列宁主义方针。这一反党集团的被粉碎，证明了我们党的牢不可破的列宁主义的团结，促使了我国人民更加团结在党及其中央委员会的周围。我们的党和人民现在比任何时候都更加团结和一致。
    马祖罗夫同志接着说，苏共第二十次代表大会以后，中央委员会在列宁主义的民族政策方面所实行的措施，更加加强了我国各族人民的友谊，并且促进了各共和国的生产力更迅速的发展。苏联现在已经没有落后的边疆地区。所有苏维埃民族共和国都有发达的工业和大规模的社会主义农业。苏联所有各族人民都有丰富的精神生活，积极地参加发展科学技术，创造出色的文化财富。
    在革命前的白俄罗斯，按人口平均计算的工业产品产量大约只是整个俄国平均数的五分之一。现在的白俄罗斯是一个强大的工业化国家。如果以每千人平均计算，白俄罗斯在汽车、拖拉机、金属切削机床的产量方面已走在西欧一些最发达国家的前面。战后十三年中，白俄罗斯的工业产值提高了十五倍以上，并超过战前水平将近两倍半。在集体农庄的农村中也发生了巨大的变化。
    在教育和文化建设方面取得了巨大成就。就每一万居民中拥有的高等学校学生的人数比例来说，白俄罗斯共和国已走在法国、德意志联邦共和国、意大利、奥地利、瑞典、比利时这些西欧国家的前面，而在十月革命以前，80％的白俄罗斯人是文盲。
    马祖罗夫同志谈到白俄罗斯今后七年中在经济和文化上的进一步全面发展。这些年中白俄罗斯的工业产值要提高80％。谷物产量要比1958年增加约一倍，亚麻纤维和马铃薯增加50％，甜菜增加两倍多。按人口平均计算的肉类、油脂和奶类产量将大大超过美国现有水平。共和国党组织现在正在开展社会主义竞赛，争取在1959年就使集体农庄的肉类产量增加一倍。共和国中先进的集体农庄、国营农场和区都正在争取在四、五年内完成农业方面的七年计划任务。
    马祖罗夫接着谈到共和国劳动人民在讨论苏联发展国民经济控制数字时所提出的一些建议。这些建议的目的都是为了更充分地利用现有的潜力。国家计划委员会的计划规定，在涡轮机发电站的发电能力提高二点三倍的情况下，输电线路的长度至少增加一倍（同过去七年比较）。必须加速输电线路的建设工作。在编制七年计划中的工业生产计划时需要格外地、特别仔细地研究工业中的专业化问题和各经济区之间的协作关系问题。一些国民经济委员会往往不得不自己安排本经济区工业上所必需的一些制件的生产，虽然其他经济区的专业化企业已经在生产这些制件。为了国家的利益，需要更大胆地把我国出产的机器的最重要的部件和零件、尤其是拖拉机和汽车的最重要的部件和零件的规格加以统一。然而，机器制造厂的专业化组织得不好，就会阻碍统一部件规格的设计工作。
    马祖罗夫同志在发言中有很大一部分谈的是在争取完成和超额完成七年计划中提高劳动生产率和降低产品成本任务方面党组织的任务。党组织应该积极反对管理不善和浪费的现象，加强经济核算，提高经济领导人员对改进企业工作的一切质量指标的责任心。
    马祖罗夫同志说，今后七年我国进行共产主义建设的宏伟纲领不仅鼓舞着苏联人，而且鼓舞着社会主义阵营各国的全体劳动人民以及我们全世界的朋友。这一纲领引起了我们阶级敌人的恐惧和慌乱。帝国主义者正在尽一切力量来削弱社会主义阵线，他们没有放弃反对苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家的“冷战”，企图用污蔑和挑衅的办法来诽谤我们的制度和我们的生活方式，歪曲我们的政策和我们的意向。但是，资本主义的思想家已经不可能向劳动人民群众隐瞒苏联和整个社会主义阵营的巨大成就了。
    马祖罗夫同志最后说，白俄罗斯的共产党员、白俄罗斯的人民，像全体苏联人民一样，都一致拥护苏共中央委员会所制定的、符合劳动人民根本利益的共产主义建设纲领，热烈支持这一纲领中所反映的苏联共产党的英明政策，并将献出自己的力量来争取共产主义在我国的胜利。（附图片）
