Belgian coal miners are waging a heroic struggle to fight back against the attacks of monopoly capital. Ignoring government suppression and the betrayal of right-wing union leaders, they are persisting in their strike, opposing the government and business owners' decision to close mines and lay off workers in accordance with the orders of the Western European "Coal and Steel Community" group.

Recently, due to the deepening crisis of overproduction in the coal industry in Western European countries, the "Coal and Steel Community" group countries have closed a number of coal mines and laid off a large number of miners. The coal industry crisis is particularly serious in Belgium. At present, the national coal stock has exceeded seven million tons, equivalent to three times the normal storage volume. In order to get rid of the predicament, the Belgian government and the Belgian National Coal Mining Council, in accordance with the orders of the "Coal and Steel Community" group, closed a batch of "unprofitable" mines and laid off 7,000 miners in the Borinage area of southwestern Belgium.

To protest this unreasonable measure, miners in the Borinage area began a strike on the 13th. Their struggle has received support from coal miners across the country. By the 20th, the strike had developed into a general strike of 130,000 coal miners throughout Belgium.

The coal miners' strike has received widespread support from people across the country. The Belgian Communist Party has issued a statement supporting the miners' strike and has submitted a motion in parliament demanding the establishment of a minimum living allowance system. On the 19th, teachers in Borinage expressed their sympathy for the miners through a strike. On the 23rd, workers in various industries in the Borinage mining area held a general strike to support the miners. In the Charleroi and Rouvier mining areas, many workers also went on strike to support the struggle of the coal miners.

However, just as the concerted action of the Belgian workers was increasingly showing its power, right-wing union leaders, especially the leaders of the Belgian General Federation of Labor, betrayed the workers' struggle. On the 23rd, they reached an agreement with representatives of the government and business owners, accepting a plan that was effectively agreeing to the closure of mines by the monopoly capitalists.

Now these union leaders have caused some of the striking workers to return to work. However, 20,000 miners in the Borinage area, as well as workers in 35 coal mines in Charleroi and coal and metallurgical enterprises in Mons, are still persisting in the struggle.

The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party issued a statement on the 25th, pointing out that the agreement between the government, business owners, and right-wing union leaders is unacceptable to the workers because the government and business owners have not abandoned their attempts to close mines and lay off workers on a large scale. The statement called on the strikers to continue their heroic struggle to fully realize their demands.

### 抗议无理解雇　保卫生活权利  比利时煤矿工人坚持罢工斗争

    抗议无理解雇　保卫生活权利
    比利时煤矿工人坚持罢工斗争
    本报讯　比利时煤矿工人正在为反击垄断资本的进攻而进行着英勇的斗争。他们不顾政府的镇压和右翼工会领袖的叛卖，坚持罢工，反对政府和企业主遵从西欧“煤钢联营”集团的命令，决定封闭矿井和解雇工人。
    最近，由于西欧国家煤业生产过剩的危机不断加深，“煤钢联营”集团各国都关闭了一批煤矿并大量解雇矿工。在比利时，煤业危机特别严重。目前，全国存煤量已超过七百万吨，相当于通常储存量的三倍。比利时政府和比利时全国煤矿理事会为了摆脱困境，就根据“煤钢联营”集团的命令，封闭了一批
  “不赚钱的”矿井并解雇了比利时西南部波里纳吉区七千名矿工。
    为了抗议这一无理措施，波里纳吉区的矿工在13日开始罢工。他们的斗争得到了全国煤矿工人的支持。到20日，这次罢工已发展成全比利时十三万煤矿工人的总罢工。
    煤矿工人的罢工，受到全国人民广泛的声援。比利时共产党曾经发表了支持矿工罢工的声明，并且在议会提出，要求建立最低生活保险制度的动议。19日，波里纳吉的教师曾用罢教的行动来表示对矿工的同情。23日，波里纳吉矿区各行业工人为支援矿工举行了总罢工。在沙勒罗瓦和鲁维埃尔矿区，也有许多工人罢工支持煤矿工人的斗争。
    但是，就在比利时工人的一致行动越来越显出威力的时候，右翼工会领袖，特别是比利时总工会的领袖，却出卖了工人的斗争。他们在23日同政府和企业主的代表达成协议，接受了实际上是同意垄断资本家们关闭矿井的计划。
    现在这些工会领袖已经使得部分罢工工人恢复了工作。但是波里纳吉区的二万矿工以及沙勒罗瓦的三十五个煤矿和蒙斯的煤矿和冶金企业的工人，仍然坚持斗争。
    比利时共产党中央委员会政治局25日发表声明，指出政府、企业主和右翼工会领袖的协议是工人不能接受的，因为政府和企业主没有放弃关闭矿井和大批解雇工人的企图。声明号召罢工者继续英勇斗争，以完全实现他们的要求。
