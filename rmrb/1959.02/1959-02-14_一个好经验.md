Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 13th.
Currently, a production upsurge centered on accumulating manure has begun in rural areas across the country, preluding an even greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in 1959. This bustling movement of manure accumulation and spring plowing fully demonstrates the revolutionary vigor of the broad masses, tempered by the Great Leap Forward movement of 1958 and encouraged by the immense power of the people's communes. It also shows their determination and confidence in winning the victory of the Great Leap Forward in 1959. Once again, it demonstrates the spirit of the people, armed with the idea of continuous revolution, to forge ahead courageously.

The "Five Goods" competition movement consciously launched by the members of the Yangcun People's Commune in Wuqing County, Hebei Province, which is published in this newspaper today, is a concrete manifestation of this confidence, determination, drive, and revolutionary spirit.

We can see from the "Five Goods" competition movement in the Yangcun People's Commune that to achieve a production leap forward, there must be a mass movement. The conscious revolutionary competition of the broad masses of people is the guarantee for building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. In the process of rectification and consolidation, Yangcun Commune solved the problems in production management and distribution, and established a relatively good production order. However, because a vigorous movement had not yet been created in production, many members felt that "it's too frustrating to work so slowly." They believed that the soaring enthusiasm for seizing red flags, engaging in competition, and conducting appraisals during last year's Great Leap Forward movement was truly impressive. The masses' opinion shows that they have a fire-like enthusiasm in their hearts, demanding to change our country's "poor and blank" face more quickly. This enthusiasm of the masses is valuable. At the same time, it raises a very important question for the leadership, which is how to further organize and continuously unleash the masses' enthusiasm to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. According to the masses' demands, the Yangcun People's Commune Party Committee immediately consulted with the masses on the question of "how to work this year," and quickly launched the "Five Goods" competition movement according to the masses' opinions, so that the production of the Yangcun Commune was both orderly and vigorous.

At present, a few people have set the normal conduct of production against the hot mass movement, believing that launching a mass movement is not a measure under normal circumstances. They do not really understand that a strict responsibility system, rhythmic production, and a large-scale mass movement are completely consistent. A normal production order is absolutely not to restrain the enthusiasm of the masses, but to better unleash the greater enthusiasm of the masses. The mass movement for production and construction does not eliminate but greatly needs to strengthen the responsibility system and carry out production rhythmically. The fact that Yangcun Commune carried out a vigorous mass movement on the basis of consolidating labor organization is the best proof.

The "Five Goods" competition movement in Yangcun Commune not only proves that to realize this year's Great Leap Forward, it is necessary to launch a mass movement, and that the mass movement and the normal production order can be completely unified; but also proves that this kind of competition is an important organizational form to encourage enthusiasm and mobilize all positive factors. After carrying out the "Five Goods" competition through appraisal, the broad masses of members and cadres, regardless of whether they are rated as "Five Goods," have greater enthusiasm, higher labor enthusiasm, and a stronger sense of responsibility.

From the selection of "Five Goods" members and "Five Goods" cadres, and from learning from and catching up with the "Five Goods," the broad masses of members expressed a strong desire to be good socialist workers. Loving the commune is loving socialism; hard work is to create a beautiful socialist life. This idea is vividly and concretely reflected in the conditions of the two "Five Goods". When the members found the "Five Goods" conditions from the advanced producers, they cited many deeds of these people loving the commune and working hard to illustrate that to be a good socialist worker, one must be good in advanced thinking, good in labor enthusiasm, good in protecting public property, good in obeying leadership, and good in diligence and thrift… At the same time, they also expressed their praise, admiration, and learning enthusiasm for the "Five Goods" members and cadres. For those members who have not yet achieved the "Five Goods", everyone found one good, two goods, three goods or four goods in them, and encouraged them to overcome their shortcomings and strive for the "Five Goods". This practice further boosted people's confidence, determination and enthusiasm, and regarded hard work and making greater contributions to the commune as the greatest pleasure and honor. This emotion has been manifested in the already launched manure accumulation upsurge. From the "Five Goods" competition carried out by Yangcun Commune, it can be seen that the broad masses' consciousness of participating in the cause of socialist construction has improved more than last year.

Closer integration of leaders and the masses, and striving for the common goal of achieving a greater leap forward, is another feature of the "Five Goods" movement in Yangcun Commune. Last year's Great Leap Forward movement relied precisely on the combination of Party leadership and mass movement. This important experience has been proven again by the "Five Goods" movement in Yangcun Commune. The "Five Goods" movement is the product of resolutely implementing the Party's mass line, and at the same time it has promoted the closer integration of leaders and the masses. To run the commune better and achieve a greater leap forward in production is the urgent requirement of the broad masses of members, and it is their greatest interest. Therefore, they hope that the commune cadres will lead them to work hard to realize such requirements and reach this goal as soon as possible. The Yangcun Commune Party Committee and many production team leaders understand this. They realize that this is the concentrated expression of the masses' enthusiasm, so they believe in the masses even more, rely on the masses and are good at consulting with the masses. Not only that, they also carried out appraisals with the masses and accepted the masses' appraisal of them. The members praised the cadres' contributions in last year's Great Leap Forward movement, praised any person or thing in the cadres that was worthy of praise, and also pointed out the shortcomings in those aspects that they did not do enough and the shortcomings that must be corrected. Such an appraisal not only greatly boosted the cadres' enthusiasm, but also made the relationship between cadres and the masses closer. Therefore, the wisdom and enthusiasm of both cadres and the masses were twisted together, and the production movement quickly showed a new situation.

In a word, the "Five Goods" movement is a movement to go all out in production and strive for the upstream, and it is also a movement to love the commune. The great practice of socialist construction is training people to become new socialist people. The broad new people whose socialist and communist consciousness is being raised will surely create more spectacular and fruitful achievements in production than last year, and what will be produced from their powerful hands and infinite wisdom will be a greater victory for this year's great construction.

    一个好经验　
    本报评论员
    目前，在全国农村里，一个以积肥为中心的生产高潮，已经揭开了1959年农业生产更大更好更全面跃进的序幕。这个热火朝天的积肥、备耕运动，充分显示了经过1958年大跃进运动的锻炼和在人民公社巨大威力鼓舞下的广大群众的革命干劲，显示了他们对于夺取1959年大跃进胜利的决心和信心；也又一次显示了，被不断革命的思想所武装了的人民勇往直前的精神。
    今天本报发表的河北省武清县杨村人民公社社员们自觉地掀起的“五好”竞赛运动，就是这种信心、决心、干劲和革命精神的具体表现。
    我们从杨村人民公社“五好”竞赛运动中可以看到，要生产大跃进，就要有群众运动。广大人民群众自觉的革命竞赛，是多、快、好、省地进行社会主义建设的保证。杨村公社在进行整顿巩固工作中，解决了生产管理和分配方面的问题，建立了比较好的生产秩序。但由于暂时还没有在生产上造成声势猛烈的运动，许多社员就感到“这么慢腾腾地干太憋气”。他们认为在去年大跃进运动中夺红旗、搞竞赛、闹评比的冲天干劲，才像个干的样子。群众的这个意见，说明他们心里蕴藏着火一般的热情，要求更快地改变我们国家“一穷二白”的面貌。群众的这种热情是可贵的，同时，也给领导上提出了一个非常重要的问题，就是如何进一步组织和不断地发挥群众的干劲，实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进。杨村人民公社党委根据群众的要求，立即和群众商量“今年怎样干”的问题，按照群众的意见迅速掀起“五好”竞赛运动，因而使杨村公社的生产搞得既有条不紊又轰轰烈烈。
    现在，有少数人把正常地进行生产和火热的群众运动对立起来，认为大搞群众运动不是正常情况下的措施。他们没有真正懂得，严格的责任制、有节奏地进行生产和大规模的群众运动是完全一致的。正常的生产秩序绝对不是为了束缚群众的干劲，而是为了更好地发挥群众的更大干劲；生产建设的群众运动并不是不要而是非常需要加强责任制并有节奏地进行。杨村公社在整顿劳动组织的基础上开展了轰轰烈烈的群众运动的事实，就是一个最好的证明。
    杨村公社的“五好”竞赛运动，不但证明要实现今年的大跃进就要大搞群众运动，群众运动和正常的生产秩序完全可以统一起来；而且证明这种竞赛是鼓干劲、调动一切积极因素的重要组织形式，经过评比开展“五好”竞赛以后，广大社员和干部，不管是否被评为“五好”，干劲都更大了，劳动积极性更高了，责任心也更加强了。
    从评选“五好”社员、“五好”干部和学“五好”、赶“五好”当中，广大社员表示了要作一个好的社会主义劳动者的强烈愿望。热爱公社就是热爱社会主义；苦干就是为了创造社会主义的美好生活。这种思想生动而又具体地反映在两个“五好”条件中。社员们在从先进生产者身上找到“五好”条件时，举出了这些人的许多爱社和苦干的事迹来说明要作一个好的社会主义劳动者，必须作到思想先进好、劳动干劲好、爱护公共财产好、服从领导好、勤俭节约好……。同时也表露了他们对于“五好”社员、干部的赞扬、羡慕和学习热情。对于那些还没有作到“五好”的社员，大家从他们身上找到了一好、两好、三好或四好，并鼓励他们克服缺点，争取“五好”。这种作法，进一步鼓起了人们的信心、决心和干劲，把苦干和对公社作出更大的贡献，当作最大的愉快和荣誉。这种情绪从已经掀起的积肥高潮中表现了出来。从杨村公社开展的“五好”竞赛中，可以看出广大群众投身于社会主义建设事业的自觉性比去年又有了提高。
    领导和群众更加紧密的结合，为实现更大跃进的共同目标而奋斗，是杨村公社“五好”运动的另一个特点。去年大跃进运动所依靠的正是党的领导和群众运动相结合。这条重要经验又为杨村公社的“五好”运动证明了。“五好”运动是坚决执行党的群众路线的产物，同时也又反过来促进了领导和群众的紧密结合。把公社办的更好，让生产有更大的跃进，是广大社员群众迫切的要求，是他们的最大利益。因此，他们希望公社干部领导他们努力实现这样的要求，尽快达到这个目标。杨村公社党委和许多生产队长了解这一点。他们认识到这就是群众积极性的集中表现，所以他们更加相信群众，依靠群众和善于同群众商量。不仅这样，他们还和群众在一起进行评比，接受群众对他们的鉴定。社员群众表扬了干部在去年大跃进运动中的贡献，表扬干部中任何值得表扬的一个人、一件事，也提出他们在那些方面作的不够和必须改正的缺点。这样的评比，不只是大大鼓起了干部的干劲，而且使干部和群众的关系更加密切了。因而使干部群众两方面的智慧和干劲拧在了一起，使生产运动迅速出现了新局面。
    一句话，“五好”运动是一个在生产上鼓足干劲、力争上游的运动，也是一个爱社运动。社会主义建设的伟大实践，正在把人们锻炼成为社会主义的新人。社会主义、共产主义觉悟正在日益提高的广大新人，必将在生产上创造出比去年更加壮观、丰硕的成就，从他们有力的双手上和无穷的智慧里所产生的将是今年伟大建设的更大胜利。
