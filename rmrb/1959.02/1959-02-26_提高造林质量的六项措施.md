Six Measures to Improve Afforestation Quality
Assistant Minister of Forestry, Zhang Zhao

In recent years, China's afforestation efforts have greatly developed. Many barren mountains, wastelands, and deserts have begun to be greened, and many emerging forestry bases have been established. The desire to change the face of the motherland is gradually being realized. However, on the other hand, there are also some shortcomings and problems in the afforestation undertaking. The main one is that the overall improvement of afforestation quality is not significant enough. In some areas, there are still inappropriate choices of afforestation sites and tree species, substandard quality of seedlings, neglect of planting techniques, sparse planting, lack of land preparation before afforestation, and lack of tending and protection after afforestation, resulting in low survival rates or poor growth. Although these situations are individual cases and cannot be completely avoided in large-scale afforestation movements and situations of insufficient experience, they are worthy of our attention.

To improve the quality of afforestation, we must first clarify the purpose and technical nature of afforestation ideologically. We must not simply view afforestation as just planting trees, but recognize that afforestation is an important part of socialist economic construction. Good afforestation can produce timber, oil, fruits, maintain soil and water, prevent wind and fix sand, ensure agricultural production, beautify the environment, and meet the needs of national production development and people's lives. At the same time, we must also realize that trees are living organisms that require good growing conditions, that is, appropriate soil, climate, sunlight, moisture, and nutrients, and must not be attacked by disasters in order to survive and grow well.

Therefore, in the afforestation undertaking, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party, implement the Party's mass line, emphasize both quantity and quality, emphasize both soaring enthusiasm and scientific analysis, and vigorously grasp various technical measures to make afforestation work more solid and meticulous.

Practice has proved that the measures to improve afforestation quality are basically consistent with the requirements of the "Eight-Character Charter" in agriculture, but the specific content and practices are different. The main technical measures for afforestation are as follows:

One, Suitable Site, Suitable Tree Species: This means that afforestation should be based on the natural conditions such as soil and climate of the afforestation site, and select tree species suitable for growing in this environment, planting the trees in the place most suitable for their growth. If we do not follow the natural conditions and the growth habits of trees, and plant them randomly, planting trees that like warmth in cold places; planting trees that like humidity in arid places; planting trees suitable for growing on flat ground on high mountains, we will certainly fail. They will either not survive, survive in small numbers, or grow poorly and fail to become forests.

Two, Meticulous Land Preparation: The water and nutrients needed for the development and growth of trees are absorbed by the roots from the soil. Turning and breaking the soil makes the soil loose, which not only makes it easy for the roots of seedlings to expand, but also improves the soil's ability to store water, conserve moisture, and ventilate, which is conducive to the growth of trees. Generally, barren hills should be combined with soil and water conservation and land preparation should be carried out in the form of horizontal steps, horizontal ditches, fish-scale pits, and horizontal terraces. In mountainous areas with lush weeds and not serious soil erosion, grass can be cut and mountains refined, which can save land preparation labor and increase soil fertility.

Three, Fine Seeds and Strong Seedlings: Selecting fine seeds and cultivating strong seedlings is one of the keys to improving the quality of afforestation. Without good seeds and good seedlings, of course, good trees cannot grow. The seeds for cultivating seedlings should be collected in a timely manner according to the maturity period of various tree species, and carefully processed and selected. In order to ensure the source of excellent seeds, communes should be actively encouraged to delineate mother tree forests and establish seed collection areas. In order to improve seedling yield and quality, the "Eight-Character Charter" of agriculture should also be conscientiously implemented in seedling cultivation.

Four, Appropriate Dense Planting: Appropriate dense planting can improve land utilization, increase yield per unit area, and promote the growth of trees into straight timber with fewer branches, while at the same time promoting early closure, which is conducive to soil and water conservation and reduces tending labor. Therefore, except for special economic forests such as oil tea, tung oil, walnuts, and fruits that are mainly harvested for fruits, which should leave room for the development of tree crowns, other forest types and tree species should be planted appropriately densely. The size of the row spacing should be determined according to the growth rate of various trees, the condition of the afforestation site, and the required size of the timber.

Five, Tending and Protection: Weeding and loosening the soil are the most effective ways to promote tree growth. Similarly, five-year-old saplings that have been tended several times grow three to five times faster than those that have not been tended. Barren oil tea forests have very low yields. After tending, yields can be significantly increased in the second year and can be increased tenfold in the third year. Weeding should be done "early, small, and thoroughly"; the larger the area of loosening the soil, the better, but damage to seedlings should be avoided. Protecting young forests is also very important. Prevention should be the main focus, and effective measures should be taken to prevent fires, pests and diseases, and damage from humans and animals.

Six, Reform Tools: To improve the quality of afforestation and increase labor productivity, we must carry out a technical revolution movement centered on reforming tools, so that afforestation can more comprehensively meet the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical. At present, the afforestation tools that should be focused on researching, improving, and creating are tools for land preparation and tending in mountainous areas, hole openers, seedling plows, cutting and striping tools for cuttings, and seed collection tools for tall trees.

The above six measures are the general requirements for improving the quality of afforestation. In the case of creating fast-growing and high-yielding forests or where irrigation and fertilization are available, irrigation and fertilization should also be increased. (Attached picture)

    提高造林质量的六项措施
    林业部部长助理　张昭
    几年来，我国造林事业有了很大的发展，许多荒山、荒地和沙漠已经开始绿化了，许多新兴的林业基地已经建立起来了，改变祖国自然面貌的愿望正在逐步实现。但是，另一方面，在造林事业中也存在一些缺点和问题，主要是造林质量的全面提高还不够显著，甚至有些地区仍然出现造林地和造林树种选择不当，种苗质量不合要求，忽视种植技术，植株过稀，造林前不整地和造林后缺乏抚育保护，因而产生成活率不高或生长不旺等现象。虽然这些情况是个别的，也不是大规模造林运动中和经验不足的情况下可以完全避免的；但是却是值得我们注意的。
    提高造林质量，首先应当从思想上明确造林的目的性和技术性。不能简单地把造林看成只是栽树，而要认识到造林是社会主义经济建设的重要组成部分，造好了林，就可以生产木材、油料、果品，就可以保持水土，防风固沙，保障农业生产和美化环境，满足国家生产发展和人民生活的需要。同时还要认识到林木是一种生物，需要有良好的生长条件，就是要有适当的土壤、气候、日光、水分和养料，并且不受灾害的侵袭，才能生存，才能长好。
    因此，在造林事业中，必须加强党的领导，贯彻党的群众路线，强调数量与质量并重，强调既要有冲天干劲也要有科学分析，大力抓紧各项技术措施，使造林工作做得更踏实、细致。
    实践证明，提高造林质量的措施和农业上“八字宪法”的要求基本是一致的，只是具体内容和做法上有所不同，造林的主要技术措施有以下六项：
    一，适地适树　是指造林要根据造林地土壤、气候等自然条件，选择适合在这种环境生长的树种，将树木栽在最适合它生长的地方。如果不根据自然条件和树木生长习性，随便栽，把喜欢温暖的树木栽在寒冷的地方；把喜欢湿润的树木栽在干旱的地方；把适于平地生长的树木栽在高山上，当然会遭到失败，不是活不成，活得少，就是长不旺，不成林。
    二，细致整地　树木发育生长所需要的水分和养料，是由根部从土壤中吸取的。翻地、碎土使土壤疏松，不仅苗木根系容易扩展，而且增进了土壤蓄水、保墒、通气等有利于树木生长的性能。一般荒山要结合水土保持采用水平阶，水平沟，鱼鳞坑，水平梯田等方式进行整地；杂草茂盛，水土流失不严重的山地，可劈草炼山，既可节省整地用工，又可增加土壤肥力。
    三，良种壮苗　精选良种，培育壮苗是提高造林质量的关键之一。没有好种、好苗当然长不出好树。培育苗木的种子要根据各种树种成熟期，适时采种，精细处理和挑选。为了使优良种子的来源有保证，应积极提倡公社划定母树林，建立采种区。为了提高苗木产量和质量，在育苗中也应当认真贯彻执行农业的“八字宪法”。
    四，适当密植　适当密植可以提高土地利用率，增加单位面积产量，又可以促进林木长成树干直、枝节少的良材，同时可以提早郁闭，有利于水土保持和减少抚育用工。所以除了采取果实为主的油茶、油桐、核桃、水果等特种经济林，要留出树冠发展的余地以外，其他林种树种，都应当进行适当密植。株行距的大小，要根据各种树木生长的快慢、造林地的情况和需要木材的大小来定。
    五，抚育保护　除草、松土是促进林木生长最有效的办法，同样是五年生的幼林，经过几次抚育的比没有抚育过的要快三—五倍。荒芜的油茶林，产量很低，经过抚育以后，第二年就可以显著增产，第三年可增产十倍。除草要“除早、除小、除了”；松土的面积越大越好，但要避免损伤树苗。保护幼林也很重要，应以防为主，采取有效措施防止火灾、病虫害和人畜伤害。
    六，改革工具　要提高造林质量和提高劳动生产率，就必须以改革工具为中心地进行技术革命运动，使造林事业更全面地符合多快好省的要求。目前应着重研究改进和创造的造林工具，是山地整地、抚育的工具，开穴器，起苗犁，插穗切条器和高树采种工具。
    上面六项措施，是提高造林质量的一般要求，营造快速丰产林或在灌溉、施肥有条件的情况下，还应当增加灌溉和施肥。（附图片）
