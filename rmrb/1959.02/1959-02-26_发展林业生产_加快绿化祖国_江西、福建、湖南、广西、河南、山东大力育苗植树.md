Nanchang Dispatch from our newspaper: Jiangxi Province has broken the habit of not afforesting in winter in the past, adopting a short-term blitzkrieg method to create large-scale winter forests. To date, the province has afforested 5.6 million mu, accounting for 56% of the annual afforestation task. At the same time, the quality of afforestation is better than in any previous year, achieving the goal of "planting one tree and having it live, planting a piece and having it turn green."

In the past, Jiangxi had little winter afforestation, mainly in the spring. In this way, due to the arrival of spring plowing production, labor arrangements were not enough, and the afforestation task was often delayed until the end of spring, affecting the survival and growth of seedlings. In order to solve this problem, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on launching an afforestation campaign as early as November last year, calling on all communes, groups, enterprises, schools, troops, and urban residents throughout the province to widely organize a large army for afforestation and greening, and to carry out a concentrated afforestation of 10 million mu before spring plowing, to complete the 1959 afforestation task. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, the Party committees at all levels, with the secretaries taking the lead, immediately formulated afforestation plans, made all preparations, and used the methods of short-term blitzkrieg and large-scale corps operations to organize teams and launch a vigorous afforestation campaign. In Ruijin County, 100,000 people marched towards the barren mountains, completing the 450,000 mu afforestation task in three days, exceeding the target by 33%. In the Gannan Administrative Region and the Ji'an Prefecture, 500,000 people afforested more than 3 million mu in half a month, completing the annual afforestation task. (Liu Guanghui)

Fuzhou Dispatch from our newspaper: As of February 19, Fujian Province had afforested more than 5,352,000 mu, overfulfilling the spring afforestation task and completing 53.5% of the annual afforestation task. The Provincial Party Committee recently decided to complete the task of afforesting 10 million mu this year in the first half of the year.

Fujian Province plans to afforest 10 million mu and create 1 million mu of high-yield forests this year. In creating high-yield forests, various localities have put forward the slogan of "farmland-like land preparation and afforestation, horticulture-like tending and management." Many areas have carried out deep plowing, fertilization, and irrigation when creating high-yield forests. Fujian can afforest in all seasons. Last autumn and winter, the province planted more than 1.6 million mu of timber forests such as Chinese fir, moso bamboo, Masson pine, oil tea, and tung oil trees, accounting for 23% of the annual afforestation task. Last autumn and winter, a series of preparatory work was also carried out for large-scale afforestation this spring, including forest land planning; collecting more than 23 million jin of seeds, an increase of more than ten times compared with 1957; and cultivating nearly 1.5 billion seedlings of various types.

The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has firmly grasped the current excellent opportunity for afforestation and deployed the spring afforestation work through various meetings. Under the leadership of the Party Committee secretaries in various prefectures and counties, the masses are full of enthusiasm for afforestation. Datian afforested more than 1,000 mu in one day. On the 11th, Longxi County afforested 150,000 mu in one day. (Lin Jiahuang)

Changsha Dispatch from our newspaper: Spring returns to the earth, and all things recover. In the production upsurge with fertilizer as the key, people's communes in Hunan Province have adopted a combination of professional teams and mass blitzkriegs, organizing an afforestation team of 200,000 people. At an average speed of afforesting 100,000 mu per day, they have launched a large-scale concentrated greening and afforestation movement to march towards barren mountains and bare ridges, and to wage war on the "five sides" (around houses, roads, rivers, villages and fields). As of February 2, the province had afforested 3.3 million mu and planted 15,770,000 trees along roadsides, riverbanks, around lakes, and around houses. Qidong and Lianyuan counties have overfulfilled the spring afforestation tasks.

As soon as the people's communes were established in September last year, the province immediately launched a high tide of afforestation in all seasons, afforesting more than 10 million mu in autumn and winter. This spring, the people's communes have given full play to the characteristics of being large and public, unifying planning, concentrating manpower and material resources, and carrying out afforestation in a concentrated manner on one mountain, one mountain valley, and one river. More than 790 communes in the province have established commune-run forest farms, fixed more than 70,000 experienced old farmers with forestry production experience, and engaged in forestry production for a long time, and established bases for timber forests and economic forests.

Nanning Dispatch from our newspaper: Guangxi's spring blitz afforestation movement is reaching a climax. As of February 19, the region has afforested 14.45 million mu.

This year's afforestation work in Guangxi has been carried out under the conditions of busy rural production tasks and tight labor force, adopting the practice of long-term arrangements and short-term blitzkriegs, and launching a large-scale mass movement. A total of more than 1.3 million people in the region participated in afforestation. The people of Zhaoping County, after one day of preparation and four days of blitzkrieg, have planted 1.37 million mu of various trees, which is equal to the total afforestation area of the county in the past four years. After acceptance, 98% of them meet the requirements. In the afforestation of the Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous County, the secretary took the lead, and the canteens, supply and marketing departments, and medical teams all went up the mountain, mobilizing more than 56,000 people to afforest more than 830,000 mu in one go. At present, Nandan, Damiaoshan, Zhaoping and other counties in the region have overfulfilled this year's afforestation plan.

In this year's afforestation tasks, not only a large number of timber forests are developed, but also economic forests such as tung oil, oil tea, and bamboo are planted appropriately. In the entire afforestation plan, 15% to 20% are fast-growing, high-yield forests, which generally become timber in four or five years. (Huang Shaojin)

Zhengzhou Dispatch from our newspaper: "Beginning of Spring" has passed, and the earth has thawed. Henan Province's spring afforestation movement is emerging from south to north, striving to complete or overfulfill the plan of afforesting 10 million mu and planting 1.5 billion trees around the "four sides" (waterside, riverside, roadside, and homestead side) before the arrival of the busy spring plowing season. As of the 11th, statistics show that the province has afforested 2.87 million mu, planted 1.95 billion trees around the "four sides," cultivated more than 88,000 mu of seedlings, and collected 4.23 million jin of seeds.

Early grasp, tight grasp, and great momentum are the prominent features of this year's spring afforestation here. Nanyang Prefecture took the lead, afforesting more than 1.79 million mu and planting more than 1.16 billion trees around the "four sides" in two days, overfulfilling the annual tree planting and afforestation task. In Guangshan, Luoshan and other eight counties in Xinyang Prefecture, 150,000 to 160,000 people participated in afforestation every day, and 80% of the spring afforestation task has been completed.

On the 12th of this month, the Provincial Department of Agriculture held a telephone conference of agricultural bureau chiefs of various prefectures. On the basis of summarizing the achievements of the previous afforestation, it required all localities to make persistent efforts to launch a larger afforestation upsurge, and to comprehensively overfulfill the spring afforestation task in early March, and stipulated that February 16 to 25 is the provincial afforestation assault week. (Liu Chuanxun)

Jinan Dispatch from our newspaper: In the high tide of spring production, various localities in Shandong have seized the favorable opportunity of spring warmth and blossoming flowers, and launched a large-scale tree planting and afforestation movement, marching towards the gardenization of the land and the greening of the four sides. According to preliminary statistics from Yantai, Changwei, Liaocheng, Jinan, Jining, Linyi, Zibo and other regions, more than 1.7 million mu have been afforested, more than 59,000 mu of seedlings have been cultivated, 770 million trees have been planted along roadsides, homestead sides, and riverbanks, and 20.24 million jin of tree seeds have been collected.

This large-scale tree planting and afforestation movement in Shandong Province was carried out on the basis of winter tree planting and afforestation under the direct leadership of Party committees at all levels with planning and preparation. At the provincial party congress concluded on February 5, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China made specific arrangements for the spring tree planting and afforestation work. The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry also held a meeting of the chiefs of agricultural and forestry bureaus of various prefectures to conduct special research. Local and county party committees also held telephone conferences, radio conferences, or on-site meetings to implement, plan, and act simultaneously. In the afforestation work, various counties have adopted a method combining professional teams with the organization of the whole people to work together during agricultural gaps, and vigorously launched this movement. Yishui County organized and mobilized 500,000 people, adopting a method of dividing and contracting by area and being responsible at each level, and afforested 300,000 mu in ten days.

    发展林业生产　加快绿化祖国
    江西、福建、湖南、广西、河南、山东大力育苗植树
    本报南昌电　江西省打破往年冬季不造林的习惯，采用短期突击作战的方法，大造冬季林。至今，全省已造林五百六十万亩，占全年造林任务的56％；同时，造林质量比以往任何一年都好，达到了“造一株活一株、造一片绿一片”的要求。
    江西过去冬季造林少，主要是春季造林，这样，由于春耕生产到来，劳力安排不过来，往往延迟到春季末才能完成造林任务，影响树苗的成活和生长。为了解决这个问题，中共江西省委早在去年11月就发布了开展造林运动的指示，号召全省各公社、团体、企业、学校、部队和城市居民广泛组织造林绿化大军，在春耕前突击造林一千万亩，完成1959年造林任务。全省各级党委根据省委的指示，书记亲自挂帅，立即制定了造林规划，做好了一切准备后，运用短期突击、大兵团作战的方法，组织队伍，开展起了声势浩大的造林运动。瑞金全县十万人马向荒山进军，大战三天超额33％完成了四十五万亩造林任务。赣南行政区和吉安专区的五十万人民半月内造林三百多万亩，完成了全年造林任务。　（刘光辉）
    本报福州电　到2月19日，福建省已造林五百三十五万二千多亩，超额完成春季造林任务，完成全年造林任务的53.5％。省委最近决定把今年造林一千万亩的任务提前在上半年完成。
    福建省计划今年造林一千万亩，丰产林一百万亩。各地在造丰产林中，提出“整地造林农艺化、抚育管理园艺化”的口号。许多地区造丰产林时进行了深翻土地和施肥灌溉。福建一年四季都可造林，去年秋、冬全省造杉木、毛竹、马尾松、油茶和油桐等用材林达一百六十多万亩，占全年造林任务的23％。在去年秋冬季，还为今春大规模造林作了一系列的准备工作，进行林地规划；采集了二千三百多万斤的种籽，比1957年增加了十倍多；培育各种苗木近十五亿株。
    中共福建省委紧紧抓住了当前造林的大好时机，通过各种会议部署了春季造林工作。各专区、县在党委书记带头下，群众造林的干劲冲天。大田一天造林一千多亩。龙溪县11日一天，就造林十五万亩。（林嘉煌）
    本报长沙电　春回大地，万物皆苏，湖南省各地人民公社在以肥料挂帅的生产高潮中，采取专业队与群众性突击相结合，组织了二十万人的造林队伍，每天平均以造林十万亩的速度，展开向荒山秃岭进军，向“五旁”开战的大规模集中绿化造林运动。截至2月2日，全省造林三百三十万亩，在道路两旁、河流两岸、湖泊周围、屋前屋后共植树一千五百七十七万株。祁东、涟源两县已超额完成春季造林任务。
    去年9月人民公社一成立，全省立即掀起四季造林的高潮，秋冬造林一千多万亩。今春，各人民公社充分发挥了大、公的特点，统一规划、集中人力、物力，进行一个山头、一个山冲、一条河流，成片集中的造林。全省有七百九十多个公社建立了社办林场，固定了有林业生产经验的老农七万多人，长期进行林业生产，并建立用材林和经济林基地。　（李进挺）
    本报南宁电　广西春季突击造林运动正走向高潮。截至2月19日止，全区已造林一千四百四十五万亩。
    广西今年的造林工作，是在农村生产任务繁忙，劳动力紧张的情况下，采取了长安排、短突击，大搞群众运动的做法进行的，全区参加造林的群众共达一百三十多万人。昭平全县人民，经过一天准备，四天突击，已种下了各种林木一百三十七万亩，等于这个县四年来造林面积的总和，经过验收，98％都合乎要求。大苗山苗族自治县在造林中，书记带头，食堂、供销部、医疗队齐上山，先后出动五万六千多人，一鼓作气造林八十三万多亩。目前，全区已有南丹、大苗山、昭平等县超额完成了今年的造林计划。
    在今年的造林任务中，不仅大量发展用材林，而且适当多种油桐、油茶、竹子等经济林。整个造林计划中，有15％到20％是快速高额丰产林，这种林木一般在四、五年即成材。　（黄绍进）
    本报郑州电　“立春”已过，大地解冻。河南省春季造林运动正由南而北出现高潮，力争在繁忙的春耕季节到来之前，完成或超额完成春季造林一千万亩，“四旁”（水旁、河旁、路旁、宅旁）植树十五亿株的计划。截至11日统计：全省已经造林二百八十七万亩，“四旁”植树十九亿五千多万株，育苗八万八千多亩，采种四百二十三万斤。
    抓的早、抓的紧、声势大是这里今年春季造林的显著特点。南阳专区一马当先，两天时间造林一百七十九万多亩，“四旁”植树十一亿六千多万株，超额完成了全年植树造林任务。信阳专区光山、罗山等八个县，每县每天有十五、六万人参加造林，春季造林任务已经完成80％。
    本月12日，省农业厅召开各专区农业局长电话会议，在总结前一段造林成绩的基础上，要求各地再接再厉地掀起更大的造林高潮，在3月上旬全面超额完成春季造林任务，并规定2月16日至25日为全省造林突击周。
