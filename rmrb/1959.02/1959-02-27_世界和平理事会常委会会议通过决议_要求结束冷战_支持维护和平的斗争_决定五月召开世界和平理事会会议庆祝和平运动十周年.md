Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 26th. The World Peace Council Standing Committee meeting, which opened in Moscow on the 21st, concluded on the 25th. The meeting passed two resolutions and one appeal.

    The resolution "Regarding the Convening of the World Peace Council Meeting" announced that, in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the World Peace Movement, the World Peace Council meeting will be held in Stockholm from May 8th to 13th this year.

    The resolution, entitled "End the Cold War!" pointed out that people all over the world hate the "Cold War" and demand its end. This desire is now so strong that the governments of all countries must take it into consideration. The resolution went on to say that some are attempting to use the "Cold War" to justify colonial rule. They are using force, and in some areas even war, to trample on the rights of various peoples to independence.

    The resolution said that tensions in the heart of Europe and threats to security have intensified. Refusing to establish security zones and armed forces "separation" zones in Europe, refusing to hold negotiations on a German peace treaty, and providing nuclear weapons to West Germany are all practices that are intensifying the "Cold War" and creating new direct dangers.

    The resolution emphasized that it is high time to embark on the path of negotiation and hold high-level meetings to resolve outstanding issues. At present, the desire of the people of all countries to change the situation is so strong that it is possible to end the "Cold War" forever.

    The resolution said that the World Peace Movement has greatly strengthened. New and powerful forces for peace have emerged in some regions of the world. Close cooperation has been established with them, which further promotes the struggle of the people of all countries for peace.

    The resolution concluded by saying that we firmly and unconditionally support the efforts of all those who are working to maintain peace through any means.

    The appeal entitled "Stop Nuclear Weapons Testing!" called on the people of all countries to put pressure on governments that are obstructing the achievement of an agreement to ban nuclear weapons testing. The appeal said that all social groups and individuals should send delegations and protest letters to Geneva. All people should firmly advocate a permanent ban on nuclear weapons testing.

    The World Peace Council Standing Committee held a press conference at the "Moscow" Hotel on the 26th to mark the close of the meeting.

    Leaders of the World Peace Council spoke in detail about the various issues facing the peace movement in answering reporters' questions.

    A reporter asked about the meeting between Soviet Premier Khrushchev and representatives of the World Peace Council Standing Committee meeting on February 24th. From the answers at the press conference, it was clear that the Soviet head of government was happy to answer all the questions raised by the meeting representatives regarding major international issues during the two-hour discussion.

    世界和平理事会常委会会议通过决议
    要求结束冷战　支持维护和平的斗争
    决定五月召开世界和平理事会会议庆祝和平运动十周年
    新华社莫斯科26日电　21日在莫斯科召开的世界和平理事会常务委员会会议于25日闭幕。会议通过了两个决议和一个呼吁书。
    会议通过的“关于召开世界和平理事会会议”的决议宣布，为庆祝世界和平运动十周年，定于今年5月8日至13日在斯德哥尔摩召开世界和平理事会会议。
    会议在题为“结束冷战！”的决议中指出，全世界的人都仇恨“冷战”，他们要求结束“冷战”。现在这种愿望已经如此强烈，以致一切国家的政府都不得不加以考虑了。决议接着说，有人正企图利用“冷战”来为殖民主义统治辩护。他们正使用武力，在某些地区甚至是用战争来蹂躏各国人民独立的权利。
    决议说，欧洲心脏的紧张局势和对安全的威胁加剧了。拒绝在欧洲建立安全地区和武装部队“隔离”区，拒绝举行对德和约谈判，向西德提供核武器等做法，使“冷战”日益加剧，并造成新的直接危险。
    决议强调指出，早就是走上谈判道路和举行高级会议来解决悬而未决的问题的时候了。目前，各国人民要求改变局势的愿望是如此强烈，以致有可能永远结束“冷战”。
    决议说，现在，世界和平运动大大加强了。世界上一些地区涌现出了新的强大的和平力量。同它们已建立了密切的合作，这就进一步推动各国人民争取和平的斗争。
    决议最后说，我们坚决无条件地支持通过任何途径维护和平的一切人士的努力。
    会议通过的题为“停止试验核武器！”的呼吁书，呼吁各国人民向阻挠达成禁止核武器试验协议的政府施加压力。呼吁书说，所有的社会团体和个人都应当向日内瓦派出代表团和发出抗议信。所有的人都应当坚决主张永远禁止核武器试验。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会26日在“莫斯科”饭店为会议闭幕举行了记者招待会。
    世界和平理事会领导人在回答记者问题时，详细谈到了和平运动所面临的各项问题。
    有记者问到苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫2月24日同世界和平理事会常务委员会会议代表会见的问题。从记者招待会上的回答中可以清楚地看出，苏联政府首脑在两小时的谈话中对于会议代表提出的有关重大国际问题的所有问题都乐意回答。
