Xinhua News Agency, 31st. Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, today issued the following statement to our reporter regarding the Malayan Federation government's forcing the Bank of China's institutions in Malaya to cease operations:

    The Malayan Federation Legislative Council passed an amendment to the "Federation Banking Act" on December 4, 1958, stipulating that banks operating in the Malayan Federation should cease operations within three months of the implementation of this law if 50% or more of their share capital is owned by a foreign government, or if a majority of their directors are appointed by a foreign government or its agents. Recently, I received a report from my Singapore branch stating that the Malayan Federation government has verbally notified the Bank of China in Kuala Lumpur to cease operations from April 1st of this year. It is not difficult to see that the Malayan authorities have taken this measure obviously to exclude our bank's institutions in Malaya. This is another extremely unfriendly action by the Malayan authorities against the Chinese people after obstructing and restricting discrimination against China's trade with Malaya.

    Everyone knows that China has always been committed to developing friendly relations with Malaya based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese people have deeply sympathized with the Malayan people's demands for national independence, and the Chinese government immediately recognized Malaya after the establishment of the Federation. China has also always been committed to developing trade relations with Malaya based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and exchange of goods. Our bank's institutions in Malaya, in the spirit of the above, abide by local laws and operate normal banking businesses, making beneficial contributions to promoting trade between the two countries, supporting the local economy, and enhancing friendship between the two peoples. However, the Malayan authorities have not only failed to make corresponding efforts to enhance friendly and trade relations between the two countries, but have repeatedly obstructed the development of such relations, adopting various restrictions and discriminatory attitudes towards China's trade with Malaya, and further forcing our bank's institutions in Malaya to cease operations. We cannot but deeply regret this extremely unfriendly action.

    It is worth noting that the Malayan authorities' extremely unfriendly actions towards China are inseparable from the conspiracies of certain imperialists. In particular, U.S. imperialism has never wanted to see the development of friendly cooperation and trade relations between Asian and African countries, and especially does not want to see the development of friendly cooperation and trade relations between China and other Asian and African countries. They are using various tricks to provoke relations between Asian and African countries and undermine the unity and cooperation of the Asian and African people. The above-mentioned actions of the Malayan authorities happen to conform to the wishes of imperialism, and the result can only be beneficial to imperialism and will never bring any benefits to the Malayan people. The Malayan authorities' extremely unfriendly actions towards China cannot but seriously affect the smooth progress of current Sino-Malayan trade. The Chinese people and the Malayan people have traditional friendship and long-standing economic ties. It is natural for China and Malaya to live in friendship and develop equal and mutually beneficial trade exchanges, and no force can stop it.

### 马来亚当局对我国以怨报德  南汉宸就中国银行分行被迫停业发表谈话

    马来亚当局对我国以怨报德
    南汉宸就中国银行分行被迫停业发表谈话
    新华社31日讯　中国银行董事长南汉宸，今日就马来亚联合邦政府迫使中国银行在马来亚的机构停业一事，向本社记者发表谈话如下：
    马来亚联合邦立法会议在1958年12月4日通过了一项“联合邦银行法案”修正案，规定在马来亚联合邦营业的银行，如股本50％或50％以上属于外国政府所有，或者董事会中多数董事由外国政府或其代理机构所任命，应该在此项法令实施后三个月内停止营业。最近接我新加坡分行报称：马来亚联合邦政府已口头通知我吉隆坡中国银行，于本年4月1日起停止营业。这就不难看出，马来亚当局采取这一措施，显然是专为排斥我行在马来亚的机构。这是马来亚当局在阻挠和限制歧视我国对马来亚贸易之后，对中国人民又一个极不友好的行动。
    谁都知道，我国一向根据和平共处五项原则，致力于发展同马来亚的友好关系。我国人民对于马来亚人民的民族独立要求，给予了深切的同情，当马来亚成立联合邦以后，我国政府立即予以承认。我国也一向根据平等互利，互通有无的原则，致力于发展同马来亚的贸易关系。我行设在马来亚的机构，正是本着上述精神，遵守当地法令，经营正常的银行业务，对于促进两国贸易及扶持当地经济增进两国人民的友好，作出了有益的贡献。但是马来亚当局不仅没有对增进两国友好关系和贸易关系作出相应的努力，反而一再阻挠这种关系的发展，对我国同马来亚的贸易采取多方限制歧视的态度，进而迫使我行在马来亚的机构停业，这种极不友好的举动，不能不使我们深为遗憾。
    值得注意的是马来亚当局对我国采取极不友好的行动，是同某些帝国主义的阴谋活动分不开的。特别是美帝国主义从来就不愿意看到亚非各国间友好合作和贸易关系的发展，尤其不愿意看到中国同其他亚非国家间友好合作和贸易关系的发展。他们正在使用种种伎俩来挑拨亚非各国间的关系，破坏亚非人民的团结和合作。马来亚当局的上述行动，恰好符合了帝国主义愿望，其结果只能有利于帝国主义而决不会给马来亚人民带来任何好处。马来亚当局对我国极不友好的举动，不能不严重影响到当前中马贸易的顺利进行。中国人民和马来亚人民有着传统的友谊和历史悠久的经济联系。中马两国友好相处，发展平等互利的贸易往来，是很自然的事情，是任何力量也不能阻挡的。
