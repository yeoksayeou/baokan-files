    Full of Honors
    Among the more than 800 iron and steel warriors who won awards on the iron and steel front in Qingyang County, Gansu Province, there is an old hero who is the oldest. Although the old man's face is covered with wrinkles, his bright eyes make people believe that he still has inexhaustible energy. This old man is Comrade Wang Huaichen, an old Communist Party member and old Red Army soldier who has won the honorary title of model for honorable veterans in Pingliang Prefecture. Today, this old man, covered in honors, has added another glittering gold medal.
    Comrade Wang Huaichen is now in his fifties, but he always stands at the forefront, no matter how difficult the task. In 1933, he joined the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in his hometown of Sichuan, and joined the Communist Party the following year. In 1935, he participated in the glorious 25,000-li Long March. In the army, he served as company commander, battalion commander, and deputy regiment commander. In the arduous revolutionary struggle, he bled nine times and became a second-class disabled soldier due to injuries, but he still persisted in the struggle. In 1948, the organization, in consideration of his health, allowed him and his lover to settle in Zhangjiahe Village, Wentai.
    In the autumn of 1958, the county organized an iron and steel production expedition to Huating to make steel in a big way. The organization, in consideration of his health, wanted to keep him at home to lead production, but he stubbornly said, "Although I am old, I am a Communist Party member, and my heart is not old." He repeatedly requested to go to the iron and steel front. He carried his luggage and tools, and after seven days of marching, he encountered torrential rain as soon as he arrived at the construction site, making transportation difficult. Coal could not be transported in, which affected the loading of the furnace. At this time, the workers were rushing to transport coal for continuous production, and Comrade Wang Huaichen participated in carrying coal.
    Soon after arriving at the construction site, he became the political instructor of the Red Flag Battalion's Seventh Company. At that time, the company was responsible for transportation. He always ate, lived, and worked with the soldiers. He went to carry coal every time, and he carried up to 177 jin at a time. During breaks, he would tell the soldiers stories of the Long March. Li Yaoshan originally felt that the construction site was too hard and wanted to go home, but under his influence, he suddenly became active and was praised by the prefectural committee and rewarded by the county committee.
    Comrade Wang Huaichen has always been loyal to the Party and the people, and has always maintained the glorious traditions of a revolutionary soldier. He has been named a labor model five times.

    满载荣誉
    在甘肃省庆阳县钢铁前线得奖的八百多名钢铁战士中，有一位年岁最大的老英雄。虽然这位老人的脸上已布满皱纹，但从他那双神采奕奕的眼睛里却使人相信，在他身上还蕴藏着用之不尽的精力。这位老人就是曾荣获平凉专区荣誉退伍军人标兵光荣称号的老共产党员、老红军王怀臣同志。在这位全身满载荣誉的老人身上，今天又添上了一枚闪闪发光的金色奖章。
    王怀臣同志今年已是五十开外的人了，但无论那项艰巨的工作，他总是站在最前列。1933年他在故乡——四川参加了工农红军，第二年就加入了共产党，1935年参加了光荣的二万五千里长征。在部队里，他任过连长、营长、副团长等职。在艰苦的革命斗争中，他曾经九次流血，因受伤成为二等残废，但他仍然坚持斗争。1948年组织上为照顾他的身体，他才和自己爱人落户在温台张家河村。
    1958年秋，县上组织钢铁生产远征军到华亭大炼钢铁。组织上为照顾他的身体，想留他在家里领导生产，但他倔强地说：“我年纪虽老了，但我是共产党员，我的心并没有老。”他再三地要求到钢铁战线上去。他扛上行李、工具、经过七天的行军，刚到工地，就遇到倾盆大雨，运输困难，炭运不来，影响装炉。这时工人都在为连续生产赶着运炭，王怀臣同志就参加担炭。
    到工地不久，他就担任了红旗营七连指导员，当时该连负责运输，他总是和战士同吃、同住、同劳动，每回担炭他都去，一次他最多担到一百七十七斤。在休息的时候，他就给战士讲长征的故事。李耀山原来觉得工地苦，想回家，在他的感染下，一下变得积极起来，并受到地委表扬和县委奖励。
    王怀臣同志就是这样一贯忠于党、忠于人民，一贯保持着革命军人的光荣传统。他曾五次被评为劳动模范。
