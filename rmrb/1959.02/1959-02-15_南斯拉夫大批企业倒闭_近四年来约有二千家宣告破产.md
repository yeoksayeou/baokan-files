Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, February 12th: While in all socialist countries, with the development of the national economy, each year sees a large number of new factories and enterprises put into production, in "socialist" Yugoslavia, approximately two thousand enterprises have closed down in the last four years. This figure was revealed in an article titled "Chain Reaction" published in the supplement "World" of the Sarajevo newspaper "Liberation" on February 3rd. However, this article refers to the closure of enterprises as "asset liquidation."

The article also introduced the economic situation of some enterprises at the time of their closure. For example, when an enterprise in Zagreb closed down, it had as many as 1,500 creditors. Another enterprise forced into "liquidation" had total assets worth about 250,000 dinars, but its total debts amounted to 32 million dinars. The third so-called "asset liquidation" enterprise cited in the article owed 18 million dinars, but its total assets were worth only 180,000 dinars.

The article said that a series of similar examples could be cited, but all of them had one thing in common: they harmed collectives and other enterprises, and even "often led some economically strong enterprises to bankruptcy." The article also pointed out: "There are also cases where a 'new enterprise' is established while an old enterprise is still being liquidated, and the 'new enterprise' takes over the basic assets, cadres, and often also the leading cadres of the old enterprise. In fact, this 'new enterprise' has a premonition of bankruptcy from the first day of its existence." The article pointed out that the closure of these two thousand enterprises in the past four years has caused an estimated loss of 3.5 billion dinars to the collective. If the time spent on liquidation and the freezing of assets during this period are also added, the losses would be much greater.

If one were to ask why this phenomenon occurs in "socialist" Yugoslavia, where "socialism" is being built according to the "only correct path," the "Liberation" article also provided an answer to this question. The article analyzed the factors that prompted enterprises to "liquidate assets": "inappropriate consumption of working capital," "poor labor organization," "incorrect wage policies," "poor incentive policies," "inappropriate mergers of enterprises, or the separation of certain workshops from the original enterprises to become independent," some people's "delusions" in expanding their business scope "in order to make money" and to improve the status of their enterprises, and "frequent corruption and theft," etc. The article believes that it is these "factors" that have led many enterprises to "complete bankruptcy" or promoted the "disintegration" of enterprises. Moreover, the bankruptcy of one enterprise can trigger a "chain reaction," putting a series of enterprises "in trouble," because each enterprise has its own creditors, and the creditors have creditors, thus setting off a ripple effect without end.

The author of the "Liberation" article also deliberately pointed out to the readers in a "holier-than-thou" manner that the reasons for the large number of enterprise bankruptcies in Yugoslavia are different from the "ruthless competition" and "exhausting all efforts to squeeze out and monopolize in the market" in capitalist countries. However, the author also failed to point out what the large number of enterprise bankruptcies and their causes have in common with the economic phenomena of socialist countries.

As for what measures Yugoslavia will take to address this phenomenon, the author of the article concluded: "It is difficult to say what measures should be taken in the current situation."

### 南斯拉夫大批企业倒闭  近四年来约有二千家宣告破产

    南斯拉夫大批企业倒闭
    近四年来约有二千家宣告破产
    新华社贝尔格莱德12日电　随着国民经济的发展，在所有社会主义国家，每年都有大批新的工厂企业投入生产，但是，在“社会主义”的南斯拉夫近四年来却有约两千家企业倒闭。这个数字是2月3日萨拉热窝“解放报”副刊“世界”刊载的一篇题为“链锁反应”的文章透露的。不过，这篇文章把企业的倒闭叫做“清产还债”。
    文章还介绍了一些企业在倒闭时的经济情况。如萨格勒布一家企业倒闭时竟有一千五百个债主。另一个被迫“清算”的企业的所有财产共值二十五万第纳尔左右，但它所欠债务的总数却达三千二百万第纳尔。文章举出的第三个所谓“清产还债”的企业，欠债一千八百万第纳尔，可是它的全部财产仅值十八万第纳尔。
    文章说，还能举出一系列这类的例子，但是所有这些都有一个共同点，即损害集体和其他的企业，甚至“往往把一些经济上有实力的企业也引向破产”。文章还指出：“也有这种情况发生，即还在一家企业被清算的过程中就成立了‘新的企业’，而‘新的企业’接受了老企业的基本资财、干部、往往还有领导干部，实际上这种‘新企业’从它存在的第一天起就有倒闭的预感”。文章指出，最近四年来倒闭的这两千家企业给集体造成的损失估计有三十五亿第纳尔。如果再加上因为清算而耗费的时间，以及在这段时间内资财的冻结，那末损失就大得多。
    如果要问，为什么在“社会主义”的南斯拉夫会出现这种现象呢？在那里不是正根据“唯一正确的道路”在建设“社会主义”吗？对于这个问题，“解放报”的文章也作了回答。文章分析促使企业“清产还债”的因素是：“不恰当地消耗流动资金”、“不良的劳动组织”、“不正确的工资政策”、“不良的奖励政策”、“企业的不恰当的合并，或者某些车间脱离原企业而独立”、某些人“为了赚钱”和为了提高自己企业的地位，在扩大经营范围方面的“妄想”、“经常发生的贪污和盗窃”等等。文章认为正是这些“因素”使许多企业“完全破产”或促进了企业的“瓦解”。而且一家企业的破产又能引起“链锁反应”，使一系列企业“陷入困境”，因为每家企业都有自己的债主，而债主又有债主，这样一牵百动，毫无止境。
    “解放报”这篇文章的作者还用“此地无银三百两”的手法特意向读者指出：南斯拉夫大批企业倒闭的原因，不同于资本主义国家中的“无情的竞争”和“竭尽全力在市场上排挤和垄断”等等。可是作者也未指出大批企业倒闭和它的原因同社会主义国家的经济现象有什么共同之处。
    至于南斯拉夫将对这种现象采取何种措施，文章作者的结论是：“很难说在今天的情况下应该采取什么措施”。
