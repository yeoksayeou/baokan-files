    A Deal's a Deal
    The pile of manure in front of Old Man Hu Zhen's house grew taller and taller each day, looking like a small mountain. But one day, this pile of manure was suddenly divided into two, leaving people puzzled. Those who were curious couldn't help but ask.

    Old Man Hu Zhen is a veteran's family member. He lives in Sandao Gangzi Township, Xinmin County, Liaoning Province. At sixty years old, he is the forestry commissioner of the commune. His wife, fifty-eight years old, is the production team leader. Since the beginning of winter, they have been carrying manure baskets to collect manure together almost every day before dawn. After the Party issued the call to strive for a greater harvest, their enthusiasm increased even more. The old couple thought to themselves, "The young and middle-aged people are engaged in challenges and responses with great enthusiasm, and we must not admit that we are old. We must find a way to do a good job." Although both of them thought about it in their hearts and saw it in their eyes, neither of them asked the other. One evening, the old lady couldn't hold back any longer and asked the old man, "The Party has proposed a great leap forward in agricultural production, and the young people are working enthusiastically. We are not too old. I want to compete with you. Do you dare to accept the challenge?"

    "Just name your conditions! What is there to be afraid of? I guarantee to surpass you..." Old Man Hu said, giving the old lady a challenging look. But the old lady didn't care at all and said with a smile, "Then let's first compete in collecting manure and see who collects more!"

    The next day, the large pile of manure that Old Man Hu Zhen and his wife had collected together in front of their house was divided into two piles, and it was agreed that the manure collected in the future would never be mixed together.

    The two manure piles grew day by day. Twenty days later, someone estimated that Old Man Hu's pile was as much as 2,500 jin, and Old Woman Hu's pile was also 2,200 jin! Cui Yunpeng (Attached picture)

    一言为定   
    胡震老大爷门前的那堆粪，一天天地高起来，活像一座小山。可是，一天这堆粪突然被分作两下，人们一时摸不着头绪。好事的人，不免要打听一番。
    胡震老大爷是个烈属，家住在辽宁省新民县三道岗子乡，六十岁，是社里的林业委员。他的老伴五十八岁，是生产队长。入冬以来，他俩几乎每天都在天没亮的时候，就一块背着粪筐拣粪。党提出争取更大丰收的号召以后，他俩的干劲就更大了。老俩口子都想，青、壮年挑战应战搞的热火朝天，自己也绝不能服老，非得想法好好干干不可。虽说两个人都想在心里，看在眼里，可谁也没问谁。一天晚上，老大娘再也蹩不住了，就问老大爷：“党提出农业生产大跃进，青年们都干的热火朝天，咱俩年纪也都不算太大，我跟你比试比试，你敢应战吗？”
    “你就提条件吧！有什么不敢，还保证超过你……。”胡老大爷说完话，还挑战似地瞧了老大娘一眼。但是老大娘一点也不在乎，微笑着说：“那么首先就比比拣粪，看谁拣的多！”
    第二天，胡震老俩口子门前共同拣的一大堆粪，就分做了两堆，并且一言为定，今后再拣的决不掺杂在一起。
    两个粪堆，一天天地增长着。二十天后，有人估计：胡老大爷那堆足有二千五百斤，胡老大娘那堆，也有二千二百斤！　崔云鹏（附图片）
