Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 15th. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today issued a statement pointing out that the statement made by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, Phoui Sananikone, on the 11th, unilaterally declaring that Laos is no longer bound by the Geneva Accords, is a violation of the Geneva Accords.

The statement from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam said that Sananikone's statement is part of a conspiracy by U.S. imperialism and pro-U.S. reactionaries, aimed at undermining the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos, obstructing the activities of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, enabling U.S. imperialism to increasingly strengthen its interference in Laos, turning Laos into a U.S. military base, and dragging Laos into the aggressive military bloc of Southeast Asia.

The statement cited examples to illustrate that the Geneva Conference agreements on Laos have not been fully implemented. The statement said that the political settlement stipulated in Article 14 of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Laos has not been achieved, and some issues related to Article 15 of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities have not been resolved. Although the Lao fighting forces have participated in the common life of the country, the Kingdom of Laos government continues to retaliate against and discriminate against former resistance personnel, and even uses various means to suppress, slander, arrest, and kill them.

The statement said that the military clauses of the Geneva Conference on Laos have also been seriously violated. Since the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos temporarily suspended its activities, many more U.S. military personnel have entered Laos; many U.S. arms have been illegally transported into Laos, and U.S. imperialism has also increased its military "aid" to Laos, building strategic highways, and constructing airports for U.S. military aircraft. New U.S. military bases have also been established on Lao soil. Due to the instigation and deepening interference of U.S. imperialism, the Kingdom of Laos government has created tension in the Lao-Vietnamese border areas. All of this violates Articles 6, 7, 9, and 15 of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Laos, violates Articles 4 and 5 of the final declaration of the Geneva Conference, and also violates the final guarantee given by the Kingdom of Laos government at the Geneva Conference.

The statement said that the letter from the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to the Indian government on January 31, 1959, clearly pointed out that the decision of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos to suspend activities indefinitely, but to reconvene according to normal procedures, does not affect the legal status of the International Commission in Laos, nor does it diminish the authority of the International Commission in Laos in performing the tasks and responsibilities stipulated in the Geneva Accords. The two chairmen also agreed that the decision of the International Commission in Laos on July 19, 1958, to suspend activities indefinitely was a procedural decision and had nothing to do with the dissolution of the International Commission in Laos. The two chairmen believe that this does not involve the abolition of any clauses related to the International Commission in the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Laos, especially Article 39. The statement said that, based on the above circumstances, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the Kingdom of Laos government is fully bound by the Geneva Accords, and the Kingdom of Laos has the responsibility to seriously and completely fulfill the various clauses of the Geneva Conference related to Laos.

The statement said that in order to timely stop the acts of retaliation and discrimination against former resistance personnel in Laos, in order to stop the acts of transporting foreign weapons and military personnel into Laos in violation of the Geneva Accords, and in order to maintain peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, it is very necessary for the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos to continue its activities in Laos.

### 越南民主共和国政府发表声明  老挝王国有责任履行日内瓦协议  萨纳尼空的声明是美帝国主义和亲美派阴谋的一部分

    越南民主共和国政府发表声明
    老挝王国有责任履行日内瓦协议
    萨纳尼空的声明是美帝国主义和亲美派阴谋的一部分
    新华社河内15日电　越南民主共和国政府今天发表声明指出，老挝王国首相培·萨纳尼空在11日发表的片面宣布老挝不再受日内瓦协议约束的声明是违反日内瓦协议的。
    越南民主共和国的声明说，萨纳尼空的声明是美帝国主义和亲美反动派的阴谋的一部分，目的在于破坏日内瓦协议在老挝的履行，阻挠老挝国际监督和监察委员会的活动，使美帝国主义日益加强对老挝的干涉，把老挝变成美国的军事基地，并且把老挝拉进东南亚侵略性的军事集团。
    声明中举例说明日内瓦会议关于老挝问题的协定尚未充分履行。声明说，关于老挝停止敌对行动协定第十四条规定的政治解决尚未实现，同停止敌对行动协定第十五条有关的一些问题也尚未解决。寮国战斗部队虽然已经参加了国家的共同生活，但是老挝王国政府仍然不断地报复、歧视前抗战人员，甚至使用多种手段对他们进行镇压、诬蔑、逮捕和杀害。
    声明说，日内瓦会议关于老挝问题的军事条款也受到了严重的破坏。自从老挝国际监督和监察委员会暂时停止活动以来，又有许多美国军事人员进入老挝活动；许多美国军火非法运入老挝，美帝国主义还增加了对老挝的军事“援助”，修筑战略公路，修筑飞机场供美国军用飞机使用。在老挝土地上还建立了新的美国军事基地。由于美帝国主义的唆使和日益深入的干涉，老挝王国政府在越老边界地区制造了紧张局势。所有这一切都违反了关于在老挝停止敌对行动的协定第六、第七、第九和第十五条，违反了日内瓦会议最后宣言第四、第五条，也违反了老挝王国政府在日内瓦会议上的最后保证。
    声明说，日内瓦会议两位主席1959年1月31日寄给印度政府的信明确指出：老挝国际监督和监察委员会决定无限期停止活动，但是可以根据正常程序重新复会，这一决议并不影响老挝国际委员会的法律地位，也不减少老挝国际委员会在执行日内瓦协议所规定的任务和职责方面的权限。两位主席还一致认为，老挝国际委员会1958年7月19日关于无限期停止活动的决议，是程序性的决定，同解散老挝国际委员会的问题没有任何关系。两位主席认为，这毫不涉及废止老挝停止敌对行动协定中有关国际委员会的任何条款，特别是第三十九条。声明说，根据上述情况，越南民主共和国政府认为，老挝王国政府完全受日内瓦协议的约束，而且老挝王国有责任严肃而完满地履行日内瓦会议有关老挝问题的各项条款。
    声明说，为了及时制止对老挝前抗战人员实行报复和歧视的行为，为了制止违反日内瓦协议把外国武器和军事人员运入老挝的行为，为了维护印度支那和东南亚的和平，老挝国际监督和监察委员会继续在老挝的活动是十分必要的。
