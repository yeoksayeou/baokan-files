　　Eighteen years ago, Comrade Song Xueyi created heroic achievements on Langya Mountain and became one of the "Five Heroes of Langya Mountain." Now, Comrade Song Xueyi is working diligently as a life administrator in the People's Commune by the Qin River, working hard to improve everyone's living welfare.

　　"The Five Heroes of Langya Mountain," what a lofty honor, but Comrade Song Xueyi has never been proud of receiving this honor. When he returned to his hometown after being discharged from the army, for as long as eight years, Comrade Song Xueyi was concerned about how to mobilize the masses and change the poor conditions. He never boasted to the masses about his glorious history, so that the people in his hometown only knew that he was an ordinary demobilized soldier and did not know that he was one of the heroic figures of "The Five Heroes of Langya Mountain." This humble behavior fully demonstrates the qualities that a Communist Party member should possess and is worthy of people's learning.

　　Life administrator, what a common job, but Comrade Song Xueyi felt the greatest interest in this job. From canteens and bathhouses to kindergartens, from theaters and fish ponds to pig farms, he cares about everything and strives to do everything well. In construction, without every brick and tile, it is difficult to have tall buildings. In revolutionary work, without these specific tasks, it is difficult to realize our grand ideals. Some comrades who are lofty and unrealistic should learn from Comrade Song Xueyi's down-to-earth and honest work style of serving the people wholeheartedly.

### 不夸荣誉　热爱工作

    不夸荣誉　热爱工作
    十八年前，宋学义同志在狼牙山上创造了英雄的业迹，成为“狼牙山五壮士”之一。现在，宋学义同志又在沁河河边担任人民公社的生活管理员，为提高大家的生活福利而辛勤地工作着。
    “狼牙山五壮士”，这是多么崇高的荣誉，但是，宋学义同志从来不为获得这种荣誉而骄傲。当他从军队里退伍还乡时，在长达八年之久的时光里，宋学义同志关心的是怎样将群众发动起来，改变穷困的面貌，他从来不向群众夸耀自己的光荣历史，以至家乡的人只知道他是一个一般的复员军人，并不知道他是“狼牙山五壮士”之一的英雄人物。这种谦逊的行为，充分表现了一个共产党员应有的品质，值得人们学习。
    生活管理员，这是多么平凡的工作，但是宋学义同志却对这件工作感到了最大的兴趣。从食堂、浴室到幼儿园，从戏院、鱼池到养猪场，件件事他都关心，并且力求把每件事情做好。在建筑上，没有一砖一瓦，就很难有什么高楼大厦，在革命工作上，没有这些具体的工作，也就很难实现我们的远大理想。一些好高骛远不切实际的同志，应当好好学习宋学义同志的这种脚踏实地老老实实为人民服务的作风。
