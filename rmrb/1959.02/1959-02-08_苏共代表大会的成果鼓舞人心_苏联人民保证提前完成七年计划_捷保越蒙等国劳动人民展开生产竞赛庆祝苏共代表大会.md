Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 6th: The victorious achievements of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are inspiring the working people of the Soviet Union. They have all expressed their determination to strive to fulfill the Soviet Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy (1959-1965) and this year's production plan ahead of schedule.

　　Workers in Moscow call the Soviet Seven-Year Plan the Party's Second Program. Yesterday and today, workers in industrial enterprises throughout the Soviet capital continued to hold symposiums and discussions to discuss the achievements of the CPSU Congress. After discussion, the workers of the Ordzhonikidze Machine Tool Factory all expressed their determination to realize the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. They proposed to strive to complete the year's production plan two days earlier than the original guarantee, that is, on December 17. The workers of this factory also decided to produce several more automatic production lines above the plan.

　　In Minsk, the capital of the Byelorussian Republic, factories and enterprises are showing a high level of political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm. Many factory workers have proposed to strive to overfulfill the production tasks in each work shift to ensure that the Seven-Year Plan is implemented well from the beginning.

　　During the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the work team led by the famous Donbass miner Mamai averaged 3.5 tons of coal per person per work shift over the state quota. Now, the miners of this work team are waiting for Mamai, who attended the CPSU Congress, to return to report on the situation of the Congress. The workers also expressed their determination to produce more coal for the country above the quota.

　　During the CPSU Congress, employees of the Nizhny Tagil Iron and Steel Integrated Plant in the Urals launched a production emulation campaign to strive to overfulfill the steel production plan every month for each unit. Now, inspired by the victorious achievements of the CPSU Congress, this competition is being further developed.

　　Agricultural laborers in collective farms and state farms throughout the Soviet Union are also determined to strive for a greater harvest this year and rapidly increase meat production.

Xinhua News Agency: The grand prospect of communist construction shown by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy has greatly inspired the political and labor enthusiasm of the working people of socialist countries. During the Congress, the working people of Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Mongolia, and other countries held meetings to ensure that they would offer more production achievements as a tribute to the CPSU Congress. Employees and farmers in various parts of Czechoslovakia believe that the best way to celebrate the CPSU Congress is to increase production and practice economy. At the Jan Šverma factory in Brno, more than 1,000 employees have held symposiums on the CPSU Congress every day for the past few days. Employees have pledged to give full play to their production potential and strive to save 11 million crowns (Czech currency) for the country this year, twice as much as last year. Construction workers at the Pik Chemical United Enterprise in Novak City have guaranteed to complete the construction of two workshops well ahead of schedule, so that they will all be completed by January 1 next year. Steelworkers at the Great October Socialist Revolution United Factory in Pilsen proposed to produce 3,200 tons of pig iron, 8,246 tons of steel billets, and steel above the plan for the country in the first quarter of this year. To celebrate the CPSU Congress, the staff of the Sbrska Nova Ves state farm near Pilsen proposed a competition to all state farms in Slovakia to increase labor productivity and reduce production costs.

　　Laboring people from all over Bulgaria have held rallies to celebrate the convening of the CPSU Congress. People also passed congratulatory telegrams to the CPSU Congress at the meeting. These congratulatory telegrams all stated that the Bulgarian working people, inspired by the Congress, will make better achievements. Now, many production good news have come from Sofia, Rhodope, Varna and other places. Employees of the Dimitrov Shipyard in Varna completed their gift to the CPSU Congress on January 30. An oil tanker with a displacement of 4,000 tons built for the Soviet Union has been launched.

　　In the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, workers and farmers in Hanoi, Haiphong, and Ha Dong have held rallies for a week to warmly celebrate the convening of the 21st Congress of the CPSU. At these meetings, employees and farmers proposed to celebrate the CPSU Congress with new production achievements. More than 500 workers at the North Hung Hai construction site and more than 500 members of the Da Xu agricultural production cooperative in the suburbs of Hanoi immediately joined the labor and production competition after holding a celebration meeting. Workers at the Hanoi Machinery Factory recently launched a short-term production competition "Presenting Gifts to the CPSU Congress" and have achieved good results. In the past five days, workers in many workshops of this factory have overfulfilled their production targets every day. Workers at the Hanoi Second Carriage Repair Factory worked hard for half a month to repair a dilapidated carriage that was originally intended to be discarded into a durable and beautiful carriage, and the workers named it "Gift Carriage."

　　The Mongolian working people celebrated the 21st Congress of the CPSU as their own festival. In recent days, celebration rallies have been held in various places, and production emulations have been carried out, creating many outstanding production achievements. The miners of the Nalaikh Coal Mine expressed that they would learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet miners and ensure the struggle to meet the coal needs of Ulaanbaatar. They are now carrying out a competition to strive to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule. During the 21st Congress, the Ulaanbaatar Confectionery Factory organized a production team named "Twenty-First Congress" to ensure the production of new products. The workers of the Mongolian First Motor Transport Station completed the transportation plan for January ahead of schedule in the labor competition to welcome the 21st Congress of the CPSU. Employees of the Khovd Province Food Factory have been continuously creating new production records in recent days, and many employees have overfulfilled their production targets.
