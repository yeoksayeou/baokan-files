    Saluting Those Who Worked During the Spring Festival
    Anshan's Steel Output Exceeded Daily Plan
    (Our Anshan dispatch, February 10th) In Anshan Iron and Steel, this year's Spring Festival has become a joyful battle festival for steelworkers.
    On New Year's Eve, the workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel No. 1 Steelmaking Plant had their New Year's Eve dinner with their families and then went to the factory. They were determined to create a high-yield record to celebrate the Spring Festival. Before dawn on the first day of the Lunar New Year, the first heat of rapid steelmaking appeared on No. 1 open hearth furnace. Steelworkers used eight hours to smelt a heat of steel, shortening the time by one hour and forty minutes compared to the original plan.
    On the eighth day, the daily steel output of the steelmaking plant reached as high as 5,220 tons, exceeding the high-yield daily plan of 5,000 tons. "We can skip the New Year, but we can't be short of even an ounce of steel!" This is the bold statement of the steelworkers. However, the factory made thoughtful arrangements for the workers to celebrate the festival. The canteen prepared ample dumplings and non-staple foods for the workers. On the eve of the Spring Festival, the film team screened movies for the three shifts of workers in turn. The amateur theatrical troupe also performed moving programs in the club.
    Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 1 Blast Furnace Workers Spend the Spring Festival in Hard Work
    (Our Wuhan dispatch, February 10th) On the evening of New Year's Eve, the construction site of the Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 1 Blast Furnace was brightly lit. The workers of Zhang Yupu's work team went to work half an hour early at eight o'clock. In order for the experienced workers to let the young apprentices enjoy New Year's Eve, seven of the nine apprentices were given leave. There were only six people in front of the blast furnace, but they worked with one heart. Behind the furnace, Yi Yu and Zheng Songqiao, master and apprentice, kept checking the surrounding air ducts with blue lenses. From the air vents as small as silkworm heads, they saw the molten iron boiling in the furnace. Originally, it was not these two's turn to work, but they came anyway. Master Yi Yu suffers from stomach problems, and the doctor told him to rest for four months, but he did not rest for a single day. He came even earlier this evening, braving the cold wind to climb to the top of the furnace, dozens of meters high, to check each pipe. Seventeen-year-old apprentice Zheng Songqiao had only been at the blast furnace for two months. Under the guidance of his master, he was already able to operate independently and had deeply fallen in love with the blast furnace, so he did not want to go home for the Spring Festival. Near two o'clock in the night, the blast furnace tapped iron. The fiery iron water flowed smoothly into the iron water ditch, and the foundry workers immediately cast the iron water into tens of thousands of ingot-shaped iron blocks as a gift to the Party and the people.
    During the Spring Festival, the iron and steel workers from seven factories in the Wuhan textile system signed up to stay and continue production. Li Ren, the iron smelting team leader of Tianyi Printing and Dyeing Factory, had not returned to his hometown in Henan for eight or nine years. In order to produce more iron from the blast furnace, he did not go back this holiday and even gave up his rest during the Spring Festival shift.
    During the fierce battle of the iron and steel workers, many leading cadres of construction sites and factories extended cordial greetings to those who persisted in production. Wu Xuansheng, Deputy Secretary of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Party Committee, Wei Bo, Deputy Manager, and the Party and government responsible cadres of the iron smelting plant and iron smelting workshop personally went to the blast furnace on the evening of the Spring Festival to wish the workers a Happy New Year. All the workers on duty excitedly shouted in unison: Hello, leaders! Thank you for the Party's concern! The entire blast furnace construction site was submerged in a tense and joyful atmosphere.
    For People's Holiday Communication and Calls
    Harbin Postal and Telecommunications Workers Work Non-Stop
    (Our Harbin dispatch, February 10th) On the snowy New Year's Eve in Harbin, every household was joyfully celebrating the Spring Festival. However, the employees of the Harbin Postal and Telecommunications Department, who enabled people to receive letters, telegrams, and long-distance calls from distant relatives and friends wishing them a Happy Spring Festival, spent New Year's Eve in front of the letter sorting racks, in front of the switchboards, and in front of the telex machines.
    Li Rong, a sorter at the Harbin Post Office, has spent three New Year's Eves in front of the letter sorting rack. This eighteen-year-old girl, known as a national model for sorting letters, did not get off work until three o'clock in the morning on New Year's Eve. She believes that most of the letters before and after New Year's Eve report good news and congratulations to relatives and friends. How to ensure that people receive these letters on schedule during the festival is the responsibility of every post office sorter and the greatest pleasure.
    The Harbin Long-Distance Telephone Bureau was also busy on New Year's Eve. The twelve female telephone operators of the third group on duty took on the work of two people to enable their companions with children to reunite at home and celebrate New Year's Eve.
    On New Year's Eve, postal and telecommunications employees sent out 210,000 letters and 23,000 telegrams. High-Yield, High-Quality, Rapid Overhaul, Chongqing Iron and Steel Launches Revolutionary Competition
    (Our Chongqing dispatch, February 10th) On the morning of February 8th, the first day of the Spring Festival holiday, the reporter arrived at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company. At this time, the night shift steelworkers who had just gotten off work were going home to rest, chatting and laughing. Many workers were eating hot dumplings and noodles in the snack bar. The construction site and workshop were filled with the sound of gongs and drums. Teams of reporters and New Year's greetings teams shuttled through the various workshops. Loudspeakers constantly broadcasted the good news of the employees' production. We arrived at the open hearth steelmaking plant. Before the Spring Festival, this plant launched a heated competition for (high-yield, high-quality, and rapid overhaul). In order to put the No. 4 open hearth furnace into production on the first day of the Spring Festival, the workers formed three shock teams and braved the high temperature of six or seven hundred degrees to dismantle the furnace. The Mu Guiying shock team, composed of more than twenty female workers, jumped into the furnace to remove waste bricks without waiting for the superiors to assign tasks. When their feet got hot, they put wooden boards underneath. After the efforts of the workers, this open hearth furnace was finally repaired and put into production sixteen hours ahead of schedule on New Year's Eve. On this day, the steel output of the steelmaking plant increased by more than 200 tons compared to the previous day. The iron smelting plant and the large rolling mill also reported good news. On the first day of the Spring Festival, they increased pig iron by 25 tons and steel by 15 tons compared to the previous day.
    On this day, more than half of the 1,400 new workers in the open hearth steelmaking plant celebrated a meaningful Spring Festival beside the furnace. The chairman of the trade union told us that in order to have more people and facilitate shifts, the vast majority of the new workers voluntarily stayed in the factory for the Spring Festival. The new workers only sent representatives back to their hometowns to wish their relatives a Happy New Year and bring them their messages and New Year's gifts. The new workers in this workshop used the waste iron they picked up to practice for the first time and smelted a heat of "savings steel" as an activity to welcome the New Year. Starting on the evening of New Year's Eve, the company's Party Secretary and cadres worked alongside the workers to spend the holiday.
    In the past few days, representatives from the entire province and city have come to Chongqing Iron and Steel Company to comfort the workers. On the first day of the Spring Festival, the Sichuan Province and Chongqing City delegation to comfort iron and steel workers, led by the head of the delegation, Ren Baige, Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the deputy head of the delegation, Lu Dadong, Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, went to Chongqing Iron and Steel Company to extend cordial greetings to all the company's employees. Many people wrote letters to wish the workers a Happy New Year. The teachers and students of Chongqing No. 11 Middle School transferred the New Year's gifts of eggs, oranges, and fish given to them by the People's Commune to Ma Haiqing, a iron smelting hero, because Ma Haiqing's moving deeds of rescuing molten steel regardless of the high temperature of more than 1,000 degrees encouraged their studies. The literary and performance teams and dragon lantern teams, which are located in various factories throughout the company, have all been dispatched to go deep into the workshops to give live performances for the steel workers. In addition, the new workers also organized many New Year's greeting teams to visit the homes of veteran workers to wish them a Happy New Year.
    An Average of One Train Enters and Exits Every Ten Minutes, The Work of the Fengtai Station Employees is Unprecedentedly Tense
    (Reported by this newspaper) When people are joyfully celebrating the Spring Festival, the employees of the Fengtai Station in Beijing are working even more tensely than usual. Trains spewing thick smoke fly back and forth on dozens of dense lines. Passenger trains are full of passengers returning home to visit relatives, and freight trains are loaded with coal, steel, and non-staple foods such as vegetables and meat. Guo Wenman, the deputy stationmaster of this station, told reporters that in the 24 hours from 18:00 on the 7th to 18:00 on the 8th, 7,392 vehicles passed through here, an average of one train entering and exiting every ten minutes, an increase of nearly 30% compared to the same period last year.
    The heart of the station—the dispatch room—is particularly busy. Dispatchers use 26 telephones, radios, and radio stations to direct the operation of the entire station day and night. Some dispatchers are sending signals to dispatch vehicles; others are using radio waves to talk to the drivers on the locomotives, directing the drivers to send the goods directly to the dedicated lines of industrial and mining enterprises. In the past few days, thanks to the dispatchers' timely grasp of the situation and the adoption of new dispatch methods, the speed of vehicle turnover has been accelerated. Now, the number of trains issued by this station every twelve hours has increased from seven in the past to ten.
    On the first day of the Spring Festival, this station composed and disassembled a total of 5,200 train cars, and the dwell time of each car at the station was shortened by an average of 18 minutes compared to before the Spring Festival. The unloading yard was even more bustling with noise, and the loading and unloading workers were busy unloading building materials and odd-lot goods from the train cars.
    At night, the four beacon towers, more than three feet high, set up around the station were all lit up, illuminating the entire station as if it were daytime. Next to the tracks, red, green, and yellow signal lights flashed. The station's more than 1,500 employees, like railway employees at stations across the country, are working day and night.
    Welcoming a High Tide of Production: Shanghai's Major Circuit Overhaul
    (Our Shanghai dispatch, February 10th) In the early morning of the second day of the Spring Festival, when the 67 main transmission lines crisscrossing over 4,000 square kilometers of Shanghai's city area were de-energized, more than 1,000 overhaul workers took their tools and materials, boarded engineering vehicles, and dispersed in all directions to the various important lines to begin a major Spring Festival overhaul. In several overhaul teams in the northern suburbs of Shanghai, they set off particularly early today. The area they are responsible for overhauling is the center of Shanghai's chemical industry and chemical research. The large amount of smoke and dust constantly emitted from chemical factories day and night easily affects the safe power transmission of the circuit, which is a key point of this major overhaul. The Shen Senfa Advanced Group, which has been safely producing for 1,000 days, is responsible for overhauling the most important section of the line in the entire area. This group has to clean every porcelain bottle on every electric pole, replace all the iron beams connecting the porcelain bottles with wooden beams with better insulation performance, and also add three strands of wire to the existing lines to expand the power transmission capacity. Early this morning, they had already completed the first strand of wire in just over an hour. In the newly developed Pengpu Industrial Zone, centered on the machinery industry, a substation that began construction before the Spring Festival has been completed. Today, the workers of the Power Supply Company's Capital Construction Engineering Team are working hard to prepare for the wiring so that they can officially start supplying power to the entire area after the Spring Festival.
    In accordance with the requirements of this year's city-wide, more comprehensive Great Leap Forward, the Shanghai Electric Power Department has already launched a major safety inspection in January and decided to take advantage of the Spring Festival to conduct a concentrated overhaul of the power supply, power transformation, and transmission equipment in important industrial areas and key factories to welcome the high tide of production after the Spring Festival.

    八号那一天，炼钢厂钢的日产量高达五千二百二十多吨，超过了五千吨的高产日计划。“年可以不过，钢一斤一两不能缺！”这是炼钢工人们的豪语。可是，工厂却周到的安排了工人过节。食堂为工人准备了充足的饺子和副食品，春节前夕，电影队为三班工人轮流放映了电影。业余剧团也在俱乐部里演出了动人的节目。
    武钢一号高炉职工苦战当中度春节
    本报武汉10日电　大除夕晚上，武钢一号高炉工地灯火辉煌。张玉璞工班的工人们提前半小时在八点钟就上班了。老师傅为了让年轻的徒工们欢度除夕，九个徒工有七个放了假，高炉前只有六个人，可是，干起活来像一条心。在炉后，伊瑜和郑松乔师徒俩拿着蓝色镜片不停地查看周围的风管，从蚕头大的风眼里，看到炉里铁水在沸腾。本来这师徒俩都没有轮到上班，可是他们却来了。师傅伊瑜是个有胃病的人，医生要他好好休养四个月，但他一天也不休息。这天晚上来得更早，到了高炉后就冒着寒风爬上几十公尺高的炉顶检查每根管路。十七岁的徒工郑松乔到高炉只两个月，在师傅的教导下已经能独立操作了，并且深深地爱上了高炉，所以春节也不想回家。夜晚近两点钟，高炉出铁了，火龙样的铁水顺利地奔向铁水沟，铸铁工人们马上把铁水铸成元宝形的成千上万的铁块，向党和人民献礼。
    武汉市纺织系统七个厂的钢铁工人在除夕春节期间纷纷报名坚持留下生产。天一印染厂炼铁班长李仁，八、九年没有回到河南家乡去了。为了高炉多出铁，这次假期又不回去，连春节中轮班的一次休息也放弃了。
  在钢铁工人们奋战的时刻里，许多工地、工厂等领导干部纷纷向坚持生产的人们致以亲切的慰问。武钢党委副书记武旋声、副经理魏伯、炼铁厂和炼铁车间的党、政负责干部在春节晚上亲自到高炉前向工人们拜年，正在值班的全体工人们也怀着激动的心情一致高呼：领导同志们好！感谢党的关怀！整个高炉工地淹没在紧张、欢乐的气氛中。
    为了人们节日通信、通话
    哈尔滨邮电职工工作不停
    本报哈尔滨10日电　瑞雪盈野的哈尔滨除夕之夜，家家户户都是喜气洋洋地欢度春节。可是那些让人们在春节里愉快地接到远方亲友祝贺春节的信件电报和长途电话的哈尔滨市邮电部门的职工们却在分拣信件的架子前，在交换台前，在电传电报机前渡过了除夕。
    哈尔滨市邮局分拣员李荣已经有三个除夕是在分拣信件的架子前面渡过的。这个被称为全国分拣信件标兵的十八岁的姑娘，在除夕那天早晨三点钟才下班，她认为除夕前后的信件多半是向亲友报告喜讯和祝贺的，怎样使人们能在节日按期收到这些信，这是每个邮局分拣员的责任，也是最大的愉快。
    除夕之夜哈尔滨长途电话局也在忙碌着，除值班的第三组十二名女话务员们为了让那些有孩子的同伴能在家里团聚过大年夜，她们一个人担负了平时两个人的工作。
    除夕这天邮电部门职工把二十一万封信两万三千封电报发出去。高产高质快速检修重钢开展革命竞赛
    本报重庆10日电　8日，春节第一天假期的清晨，记者来到了重庆钢铁公司。这时刚下班的夜班炼钢工人有说有笑的回家休息去了。许多工人在小吃部里吃着热腾腾的汤元和面食。工地、车间锣鼓喧天；一队队的报喜队和贺年队穿梭似的在各个车间活动。扩音喇叭不断传出职工们在生产上的捷报。我们来到了平炉炼钢厂。这个厂在春节前夕，开展了一个热火朝天的（高产、高质、快速检修）竞赛。为了赶在春节第一天四号大平炉投入生产，职工们组成三个突击队，冒着六、七百度的高温动手拆炉。由二十多个女工组成的穆桂英突击队，没等上级分配任务，抢先跳进高炉的炉膛里清除废砖；脚发烫了她们就垫上木板。这座平炉经过职工们的努力，终于提前十六小时在除夕夜修好投入生产。这一天，炼钢厂钢的产量比前一日增加了二百多吨。炼铁厂和大型轧钢厂也分别传出了捷报，他们在春节第一天比前一天分别增加生铁二十五吨、钢材十五吨。
    这一天，平炉炼钢厂一千四百多新工人，一半以上都在炉旁欢度着一个有意义的春节。工会主席告诉我们说，许多新工人为了人多一些，便于轮休，绝大多数都自动留在厂里过春节。新工人只派出代表回到自己的家乡向亲人贺年，并捎去他们的口信和年礼。这个车间的新工人利用拣回的废铁，第一次实地操作，炼出了一炉“节约钢”，作为迎新春的活动。从除夕这天晚上开始，这个公司的党委书记和干部、工人一道劳动，度过假日。
    这几天，全省和全市人民都派代表到重庆钢铁公司慰问工人们，春节第一天，四川省和重庆市慰问钢铁职工代表团，由团长、中共重庆市委书记任白戈，副团长、中共重庆市委书记鲁大东率领，到重庆钢铁公司，向全公司职工进行了亲切的慰问。许多人写信向工人们拜年。重庆市第十一中学师生把人民公社赠送他们的鸡蛋、广柑、鱼等过年礼品，转送给炼铁英雄马海清。因为马海清不顾一千多度的高温抢救钢水的动人事迹鼓舞了他们的学习。遍布全公司各厂的文艺演唱队，龙灯队全部出动，深入车间为钢铁工人作现场演唱。此外，新工人还组织了许多贺年队到老工人家里拜年。
    平均十分钟进出一列列车丰台车站职工工作空前紧张
    本报讯　当人们欢度春节的时候，北京丰台车站的职工比往常更加紧张地工作着。一列列喷吐着浓烟的列车，在数十条密集的线路上来回地飞驰。客车上满载着归家探亲的旅客，货车上装满了煤块、钢材和蔬菜、肉类等副食品。这个车站的副站长郭文满告诉记者说，在7日十八时到8日十八时的二十四小时内，从这里通过的车辆达七千三百九十二辆，平均每十分钟就要进出一列车，比去年同期增加近30％。
    在车站的心脏——调度室里格外忙碌。调车员们使用二十六部电话机、报话机和无线电台，昼夜不停地指挥全站的作业。有的调度员正在发出调度车辆的信号；有的正在用无线电波和机车上的司机通话，指挥司机把货物直接送到工矿企业的专用线路上去。这几天内，由于调度员们及时掌握情况，采取新的调度方法，使车辆周转的速度加快了。现在，这个车站每十二小时发出的列车数，已由过去的七列列车增加到十列列车。
    春节第一天，这个车站总共编组、解体了五千二百多辆车皮，每辆车皮在车站的停留时间比春节前平均缩短了十八分钟。卸货场上更是人声沸腾，装卸工人们忙着从车皮上卸下建筑材料和零星货物。
    入夜，设置在车站四周的三丈多高的四个灯塔齐明，把全站照得如同白昼，线路旁边，红、绿、黄色的信号灯一闪一闪地亮着。车站的一千五百多个职工和全国各车站的铁路职工一样，正在夜以继日地战斗着。
