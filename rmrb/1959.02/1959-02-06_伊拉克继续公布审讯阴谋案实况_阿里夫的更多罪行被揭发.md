    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, February 4th: Iraqi Republic Radio continued to broadcast the secret trial proceedings of the conspirator and former Deputy Prime Minister Arif by the Special Military Tribunal on February 3rd. Witness Major Salem Fahri, Director of Iraqi Republic Radio, testified that the defendant interfered with propaganda work. He had exerted pressure to prevent the radio station from broadcasting a recording of an interview with Yemeni Crown Prince Badr, because Badr, when meeting with reporters, emphasized the establishment of a federation between Arab countries rather than complete unification.

    Attorney General Amin read aloud before the interrogation committee the written testimony, signed by Lieutenant Shehab Ahmed, another defendant involved in the November 4th conspiracy. In his testimony, he said that he had met with Major Staff Officer Salih Mahdi (Mahdi is also one of the main defendants in this conspiracy) and some officers from the Army Intelligence Department. Mahdi told him that they would arrest Prime Minister Qasim, and if his guards resisted, they would use force, and then force the Prime Minister to step down. If he refused to do so, the conspirators would assassinate him. These conspirators were carrying out this activity together with the defendant Arif.

    The February 2nd broadcast also included the testimonies of Brigadier General Ahmed Salih Abdi, Chief of Staff of the Iraqi Army, and Brigadier General Salim Said, Commander of the Third Division. Both of them said that the defendant had deviated from and betrayed the revolutionary path.

    伊拉克继续公布审讯阴谋案实况
    阿里夫的更多罪行被揭发
    新华社巴格达4日电　伊拉克共和国电台3日继续广播特别军事法庭秘密审讯阴谋分子、前副总理阿里夫的实况录音。证人、伊拉克共和国电台台长萨勒姆·法赫里少校作证说，被告干涉了宣传工作。他曾经施加压力阻止电台广播也门王太子巴德尔答记者问的录音，因为巴德尔在接见记者时强调了阿拉伯国家之间建立联邦而不是完全合并。
    总检察官阿明在审讯委员会面前宣读了另一个参加11月4日的阴谋的被告谢哈布·艾哈迈德中尉亲笔签字的书面证词。他在证词里说，他曾经会见少校参谋萨勒·马赫迪（马赫迪也是这次阴谋的主要被告之一）和陆军情报处的一些军官们。马赫迪告诉他说，他们将逮捕卡塞姆总理，如果他的警卫进行抵抗，他们将使用武力，然后迫使总理下野。如果他拒绝这样做，阴谋者们将把他暗杀掉。这些阴谋者是和被告阿里夫一起从事这次活动的。
    2日的广播还包括伊拉克陆军参谋长艾哈迈德·萨勒·阿卜迪准将和第三师师长萨利姆·赛义德准将的证词。他们两人都说被告脱离和背叛了革命道路。
