Record of High Yields on One Hundred Mu of Cotton Fields
Zhao Zhuming, First Secretary of the Communist Party of China's Dangyang County Committee in Hubei Province

Editor's Note: In 1958, the Dangyang County Committee established a "Hundred Mu High-Yield Cotton Experimental Zone" in low-yield areas, achieving high yields with an average yield of 800 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of more than twenty times the unit yield in 1957.

Cultivating large-scale high-yield fields is a completely new undertaking, and the entire production process is a struggle between old and new ideas. However, this work powerfully mobilized the masses, cleared ideological obstacles, promoted new technologies, achieved a bumper harvest, and created experience for striving for higher yields on larger cotton fields in 1959.

1958 was a year of the Great Leap Forward. In this year, many places gained experience in high yields of various crops, and many advanced units and individuals emerged. Conscientiously summarizing these experiences and promoting these experiences will have a significant positive impact on better organizing this year's larger and more comprehensive leap forward and ensuring the realization of the grain and cotton production targets proposed by the Party.

In the future, we will successively organize reports in this area to help various localities understand the situation and learn from advanced experiences.

Under the guidance of Comrade Xiao Chijiu, Secretary of the Yichang Prefectural Committee, we established a "Hundred Mu High-Yield Cotton Experimental Zone" last year. The cotton experimental zone covered a full one hundred mu of land. The results of the acceptance inspection showed an average yield of 800 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of more than twenty-three times the 1957 yield of 33 jin per mu. Among them, ten mu yielded 1,500 jin per mu; the highest three mu of the central experimental field yielded 2,320 jin of seed cotton per mu, creating the highest record in our county's cotton production.

The cotton experimental zone is located in the Shibaizi of the Dongqun Production Team (formerly Dongqun Agricultural Cooperative) of the Changbanpo People's Commune. It is a historically famous low-yield area overgrown with weeds and littered with bricks and stones. The cotton yield has only been 10 to 20 jin per mu in past years. After collectivization, the highest annual yield was only over 40 jin. In the past, a folk song circulated among the masses: "The ancestors left the old Shibaizi, the descendants cultivate it without a way, a year of hard work and sweat, it is difficult to grow good crops in the fields." However, in 1958, it changed greatly. The increase in yield suddenly increased by more than twenty times. In the face of the bumper harvest, the masses also changed their views on Shibaizi, singing joyful and heroic songs: "Good harvest in the experimental zone, cotton stalks are strong and a zhang deep, cotton bolls are full of white clouds, the yield of ginned cotton per mu is 800 jin. Ride on a steed and take advantage of the victory, launch larger satellites next year, the area will be 1,000 mu, and strive for 3,000 jin per mu."

The unprecedented bumper harvest in the cotton experimental zone last year fully demonstrated the correctness of the Party Central Committee's instruction on establishing experimental fields by cadres at all levels. Its significance and impact are far-reaching.

After Repeated Ideological Struggle
New Technologies Take Root in the Masses

Cultivating experimental fields and nurturing large-scale high-yield fields is a completely new undertaking. In the past year, it has undergone repeated ideological struggles.

After we selected "Shibaizi" as the experimental zone, we studied and formulated a plan with the cooperative, aiming for a yield of 300 jin of ginned cotton per mu. This plan aroused widespread reactions after it was announced. Some were concerned, and some were skeptical. Many people said: "The plan is just a piece of paper, buried in Shibaizi, let alone thousands of jin per mu (referring to seed cotton), even one hundred jin is difficult to guarantee." In particular, some "onlookers" were even more cynical. Middle peasant Chen Huanyin said: "Cadres eat the pen-and-ink meal, and farming is not their forte." In addition, some people thought the investment was too much, fearing that even the principal would not be recovered. However, the majority of Party members, League members, cadres, and activists believed that things proposed by the Party would not be wrong, and with the leadership of the Party, it could be done. Therefore, on the one hand, they actively started to act, leveling the land, cutting high and filling low, breaking graves and boundaries, so that the experimental zone's appearance was greatly changed, and more than one million jin of mixed fertilizer was rushed to be made; on the other hand, they launched a great debate with the skeptical and conservative factions. They calculated the measures account, the investment and income comparison account, thereby initially distinguishing between right and wrong in people's minds.

Following the planning and debate, plowing and sowing began. Here, there were many things to break through the masses' old habits. For example, deep plowing required six to eight cun, some people did not understand, first saying that the plow could not reach that deep, several comrades of the Secretariat plowed a piece of land themselves, seven to eight cun deep, for everyone to see. But they said that plowing so deep was too much for the cattle to pull, so we taught everyone to use double cattle, so that we persisted in meeting the deep plowing requirements. Dense planting required 1×1.6 chi, some people thought it was too dense and would not grow bolls, advocating at least 2×1.6 chi. Until the cotton seedlings grew to the leafing stage, the old farmer Ai Tianshun still advised the cooperative cadres to pull a row out from between the two rows, he said:

  "To get cotton bolls to grow, the leaves must not touch the leaves." We used the plan as a weapon and the high-yield facts of deep plowing and dense planting to refute the "no deep plowing theory" and the "dense planting cannot increase production theory."

In terms of sowing methods, we adopted two forms: nursery raising in nutrient pots and strip sowing in wheat rows. Some people were originally unwilling to make nutrient pots, and it happened that they were attacked by a cold wave during transplanting. It did not rain for more than a month after transplanting, coupled with a lack of experience in nursery raising and transplanting, shallow planting, and no moisture retention, resulting in severe hardening, and the seedlings were once withered and yellow, growing not as well as strip sowing. At this time, conservative ideas raised their heads again, and some people complained: "Speaking of nutrient pots, a lot of work is involved, whether it can increase production is still uncertain." At this critical juncture, we relied on the broad masses and mobilized all the cadres of the organs to carry out the "one person, one load of water, save the transplanted seedlings" movement. After three days of organizing more than two thousand person-times of continuous fighting, we overcame the drought and successfully survived this difficult time. Because the nutrient pots had sufficient nutrients, the cotton seedlings quickly turned green, early and late were different, day and night changed. In the face of the facts, the "failure theory" that had once raised its head finally vanished.

This repeated ideological struggle only eased when the cotton plants showed buds. The cotton plants in the experimental zone grew particularly strong and neat, like a green ocean, and showed buds twenty days earlier than ordinary fields. At this time, those who had always been conservative were also convinced and admitted that nothing we had done before was "blind." The hearts of the members were more like being attracted by a magnet, thinking about going to the field to take a look at all times, and once they started working in the field, they couldn't bear to let go, and the more they worked, the more energetic they became. More than fifty male and female members requested to be fixed in the experimental zone for production, treating the experimental zone as their own
  "private land." Later, when the cotton had a bumper harvest, the old people laughed until their mouths couldn't close, and the young people jumped for joy. You Tianxiu, Wang Jiafeng, and other thirty-odd cotton girls pleaded: "Let the cotton experimental zone be here for a lifetime!" Speaking the words that the broad members wanted to say.

During the experiment, we also established three mu of central experimental fields. Any new technology to be adopted was first started in this field. If it proved successful, it was推广 to the entire experimental zone, and even the entire county. These three mu of central experimental fields had little harvest over the years, and were not cotton-producing land. At that time, we, in the spirit of bold experimentation and exploration, through this series of measures, made the cotton growth always run ahead of other fields.

After we started the experimental fields, many masses also followed suit. There were militiamen, young people, girls, Young Pioneers, old women, and old men, each taking their own names, and proposing
  "catch up with the county committee, surpass the county committee" slogans, treating the experimental zone as a battlefield. Hu Qikun, Hu Qiwen, and Li Kexiu, three teenagers, after several requests, started a four-fen experimental field opposite the county committee's experimental field. At first, they didn't know how to plant, so they invited Comrade Zhu Jiayuan, the secretary of the Youth League branch, to be the instructor, and compared with us. Whatever we did, they did the same, rarely leaving for a single time. After looking at the fertilizer, they also clamored to apply more. After the same hard work as the adults, they realized their aspirations. The results of the acceptance inspection showed that the four-fen field harvested a full 320 jin of ginned cotton, and they were praised as "little heroes in the cotton experimental zone." After everyone started doing it, the elderly couldn't hold their breath either. The old man Cao Daosheng and five other old men including Cao Daohong also started a
  "Old Huang Zhong" experimental field. But after starting it, they were relatively slow to accept new technologies. When it came to pruning and topping, they didn't prune based on their old experience. But after a few days, other fields were bright and airy, with green branches and leaves, while their own fields were withered and yellow. They panicked, but were embarrassed to ask how to prune, so they rushed to the field and pruned and broke them wildly, regardless of whether they were green or red. In less than half a day, some cotton plants became "naked commanders," while others withered even more. At this time, they deeply felt that they could not survive by relying solely on their old experience, so they hurriedly asked others for advice and learned technology. Since then, they have also learned to do it like others, and now they have also achieved a bumper harvest.

Through a series of ideological struggles, and the large-scale experimental fields from the leaders to the masses, the masses were powerfully mobilized, their minds were liberated, and the masses' understanding of the implementation of various new technologies was improved, clearing ideological obstacles for the promotion of new technical measures; at the same time, the successful experiment of each new technical measure played a huge educational role for the masses.

Timely and Continuous Grasp of Technical Measures

In terms of technical measures, in addition to doing a good job in basic construction such as land leveling, fertilizer preparation, and water source development, we mainly resolutely, timely, and continuously grasped the following six key issues:

    I. Vigorously Grasp Deep, Dense, and Fertilized

Deep: After the wheat harvest, use a double-share plow to deeply plow six to eight cun, with depths reaching 1.2 chi, generally plowing three times and harrowing four times, and some fields plowing eight times.

Dense: Dense planting is generally around 4,000 plants, with a few below 4,000 plants and reaching 6,000 plants, row spacing of 1.4-1.6 chi, and plant spacing of 0.8-1.1 chi. From the results of practice, it is appropriate to have about 4,000 plants.

Fertilized: Our guiding ideology is to focus on base fertilizer and then topdressing. Base fertilizer is mainly organic slow-release fertilizer, mixed with an appropriate amount of phosphate fertilizer, and applied in sufficient quantities in layers. After harvesting the wheat, we spread 500 dan of mixed fertilizer and barn fertilizer and plowed it into the soil. Then, we applied 400 jin of cake fertilizer and 400 dan of mixed fertilizer on the new soil, and shallowly plowed and deeply harrowed about four cun. After the field was leveled, when transplanting, we applied granular fertilizer and 300 jin of cake fertilizer to fertilize the mounds. In this way, the development of the cotton plant's root system can obtain nutrients layer by layer, so as not to be undernourished or flushed away.

    II. Finely Process Seeds and Appropriately Sow Early

Seed treatment first undergoes grain selection and three to five days of sunning, fifteen days of potassium bromide fumigation, and half a month of sailisan mixing and sealing to prevent diseases and insect pests. Before sowing, soak the seeds in 80-degree warm water to promote germination. These have significant effects on ensuring strong cotton seedlings and enhancing resistance to disasters.

Appropriate early sowing and timely sowing have a direct impact on cotton harvest. We sowed as early as the vernal equinox and as late as the beginning of summer, with the lowest temperature being 11 degrees Celsius and the highest being 21 degrees Celsius. According to observation, early-sown cotton seedlings are susceptible to climate and disease and insect attacks in the early stage, but have strong resistance in the later stage; budding and fluffing are one month earlier than those sown in the beginning of summer, with an average of about 50 peaches per plant, about 15 more than those sown in the beginning of summer, and the yield is about 30% higher than those sown late.

  III. Vigorously Grasp Field Management

    1. Ditching and making compartments: In order to prevent internal waterlogging and facilitate operation, all are opened into compartments with a width of 6-8 chi, a surrounding ditch width of 1 chi and a depth of 8 cun, and a central ditch width of 8 cun and a depth of 6 cun, basically realizing gardening.

    2. Topdressing: All are applied in holes, with small and frequent meals. The method is five topdressings and four supplements. Five topdressings: one is to water 20 dan of night soil after transplanting to promote the division of the pot soil and the fusion with the field soil; the second is to use 50 jin of ammonium sulfate to promote seedling growth after the cotton seedlings turn green; the third is to use 50 jin of decomposed soybean cake, mixed with 30 jin of superphosphate, to dig a two-cun deep fertilizer pit, and then cultivate and cover the soil to provide nutrients for the flowering period; the fourth is to topdress with 20 dan of night soil mixed with 15 jin of ammonium sulfate in the early stage of flowering to supplement nutrients for the flowering period; the fifth is to topdress peach fertilizer, 20 jin of ammonium sulfate and 20 dan of night soil per mu. Four supplements: one is to use 10 to 20 jin of chemical fertilizer to promote small seedlings to catch up with large seedlings during the seedling stage; the second is to topdress phosphate fertilizer on the leaves in a proportion of 3% every three to five days from flowering to harvesting; the third is to repeatedly spray sodium naphthalene acetate from budding to harvesting; the fourth is to dig and supplement topdressing to achieve balanced plant development and promote balanced production increase. From the perspective of cotton growth and development, grasping the topdressing before seedling growth, before the peak flowering period, during the peak flowering period, and in the middle of peach setting can meet the fertilizer needs of the main development stages of cotton; through several supplementary methods, promote balanced growth, protect buds, protect peaches, increase the setting of autumn peaches, and make the cotton peaches more plump.

    3. Cultivation and earthing up: The principles of cultivation are to gradually deepen, gradually shallow, and gradually earth up and increase the height, leaving a protective strip two or three cun away from the cotton plant, so as to ensure no hardening, no weeds, and to deeply hoe autumn weeds. The experimental area generally cultivated seven times, continuing until fluffing. Continued cultivation can争取 some autumn peaches.

    4. Pruning and topping: After dense planting, the plants are generally tall, with large leaves, dense discs, and many peaches. Therefore, timely pruning and topping is particularly important for increasing production. In this regard, we must focus on doing a good job in removing trouser legs, touching unnecessary buds, picking side tips, cutting empty branches, and removing old leaves.

    5. Late topping: The issue of topping is directly related to promoting cotton growth, striving for autumn peaches, and increasing yield. We carried out different situations separately, such as late topping or not topping for thick and fat plants, early topping or later topping for thin and fat plants, late topping for dark green leaves, and early topping for yellow leaves. Flowers that bloom during the "Autumnal Equinox" can also be fertilized and mature in the same way because the temperature (around 22 degrees Celsius) is suitable, and cotton can also be harvested. According to observation, cotton plants that are topped 20 days late have about 10 more peaches per plant than those that are topped early. It can be seen that it is beneficial to top late or not top according to the growth situation.

      IV. Resolutely and Thoroughly Eliminate Insects and Cure Diseases

In order to thoroughly eliminate diseases and insect pests and ensure increased production, before sowing, we used "1605" to kill all the flowers, plants, and trees around the experimental area that were prone to hiding insects. From the seedling stage to the boll stage, we continuously used "1605," "1059," or "223" emulsion to thoroughly eliminate six major insect pests such as aphids, spider mites, blind bugs, leafhoppers, bollworms, and the most ferocious beet armyworm. Until the cotton stalks were pulled out, insects were prevented 17 times, and diseases were treated 4 times. Insect prevention reached 23 times in a few fields.

          V. Strengthen Later Management

How to extend the cotton growth period, make the cotton field ventilated and transparent, and prevent boll shedding, bud shedding, and peach rot is a major key to increasing production. Therefore, as early as July and August, when there was excessive rainfall and the cotton plants were growing vigorously and there were many unnecessary buds, we timely touched the buds to prevent the harm of rampant branch growth causing shade in the field. After August, the number of fruit branches increased. We built shelves in the field with bamboo poles and carried out the work of pushing plants in parallel, vigorously preventing and controlling late diseases and insects, and continuously carried out foliar topdressing, so that the seedlings maintained vigorous vitality, and the growth period was extended by about 20 days compared with ordinary fields, increasing the setting of autumn peaches.

          VI. Nursery Raising in Nutrient Pots

Experience has proved that nursery raising in nutrient pots has great advantages. Compared with the sown seedlings, it has the characteristics of tall plants, large leaves, many peaches, heavy weight, and strong resistance to disasters. Under the same conditions, seedlings raised in pots can harvest one jin of seed cotton with 80 cotton peaches, while seedlings grown in strips need 100 to 110 to have one jin. The members said:
   "Strip sowing is not to be mentioned, the yield is one step behind; next year we will all use pots, and a thousand mu is not too much."

Confident in Striving for Higher Yields This Year

In one year of production practice, we have accumulated some experience, but there are also many lessons. Our main experiences are: liberate our minds, break superstitions, vigorously grasp the four key links of deep, fertilized, dense, and strong, grasp comprehensive technical measures, grasp field management, one link after another, tightening each link; in terms of ideological guidance, we must grasp early, grasp well, and grasp to the end, and not let go until the cotton is harvested.

The main problems are: deep plowing is not prominent enough, base fertilizer is not sufficient, the combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is not appropriate enough, nutrient pots were not fully adopted, a few fields were sown late, and the attack of floods, all of which caused yield reductions to varying degrees. We believe that as long as we properly plug these loopholes, continue to study, and adopt new technologies, cotton still has great potential for increased production, and we are fully confident in striving for higher yields.

    百亩棉田高产记
    中共湖北当阳县委第一书记　赵竹明
    编者按：1958年，当阳县委在低产地区建立了“棉花百亩丰产试验区”，获得了高产，平均亩产皮棉八百斤，比1957年的单位产量增加了二十多倍。
    种大面积丰产田是一件全新的工作，整个的生产过程也正是新旧思想斗争的过程。但是，这个工作有力地发动了群众，扫清了思想障碍，推广了新技术，取得了丰收，并为1959年争取更大面积棉田高产创造了经验。
    1958年是大跃进的一年。在这一年里，许多地方获得了各种作物的丰产经验，出现了不少先进单位和人物。认真总结这些经验，推广这些经验，对更好地组织今年更大更全面的跃进，保证实现党所提出的粮棉生产指标，将会发生重大的积极作用。
    今后，我们将陆续组织这一方面的报道，帮助各地互相了解情况，学习先进经验。
    在宜昌地委书记萧持久同志的指导下，去年我们办了一个“棉花百亩丰产试验区”。棉花试验区整整一百亩田，验收结果，平均单产皮棉八百斤，比1957年单产三十三斤增长二十三倍多：其中有十亩单产一千五百斤；最高的三亩中心试验田，单产皮花达二千三百二十斤，创造了我县棉花生产的最高纪录。
    棉花试验区位于长板坡人民公社东群生产队（原东群农业社）的石坝子。这里杂草丛生，砖石遍地，是历史上有名的低产地区，历年来棉花单产只一、二十斤。合作化后，最高年产量也只达四十余斤。过去在群众中流传着“祖先留下老石坝，子孙耕种无办法，一年辛苦汗流尽，田里难长好庄稼”的歌谣。可是，1958年大大变样了，增产量陡增二十多倍，群众在丰收面前对石坝子的看法也变了，唱出的是喜悦而豪迈的歌声：“试验区里好收成，棉秆茁壮丈把深，满树棉桃吐白云，亩产皮棉八百斤。骑上骏马乘胜进，明年再放大卫星，面积搞到一千亩，亩产争取三千斤。”
    去年棉花试验区的空前丰收，充分地证明了党中央关于各级干部建立试验田的指示的正确性，其意义和影响是很深远的。
    经过反复的思想斗争
    新技术在群众中落脚生根
    种试验田，培育大面积丰产田，是一项全新的工作，去年一年来经过了反复的思想斗争。
    在我们选定“石坝子”当试验区后，就与社里研究制订了规划，亩产皮棉三百斤。这个规划公布后，引起了广泛的反应，有的关心，有的怀疑。不少人说：“规划一张纸，埋在石坝子，莫说每亩千把斤（指籽花），百斤也难靠住气。”特别是一些“观潮派”更是冷言冷语，中农陈环银说：“干部吃的笔杆饭，庄稼活路可不行。”另外，在投资上也有人认为多了，怕连本钱也捞不回来。但是多数党团员、干部、积极分子相信党提出来办的事不会有错，有党的领导，就能办得到。于是一方面依靠他们积极开始行动，平整土地，削高填凹，辟坟破界，使试验区面貌大为改观，并且赶制了百余万斤混合肥料；另一方面与怀疑派、保守派开展了大争大辩。算了措施账、投资与收益对比账，从而在人们思想上初步划清了是非。
    紧接着规划和辩论，就开始了耕田、播种。这里又有很多工作要冲破群众的老习惯。例如，深耕要求六至八寸，有些人不通，先说犁不到那么深，书记处几个同志就自己动手耕了一块田，深七至八寸，让大家看。可是他们又说耕这么深牛拉不起，于是我们又教给大家改用双牛拉，这样才坚持达到了深耕要求。密植要求1×1.6尺，有些人认为密了不会长桃子，主张起码搞2×1.6尺的。直到棉苗长到分叶时，老农艾天顺还劝社干部在两行中间扯一行去，他说：
  “要得棉桃结，叶子不挨叶。”我们以规划为武器，以深耕密植的高产事实，驳倒了“不能深耕论”和“密植不能增产论”。
    在播种方法上，我们采取了制钵育苗和麦行条播两种形式。对制营养钵原来就有些人不乐意，偏偏在移栽时遭到了寒潮袭击，移栽后月余不下雨，加上对育苗移栽缺乏经验，栽的浅，不保墒，发生了严重板结，禾苗一度枯黄，长得不如条播的好。此时保守思想就又抬了头，有人埋怨说：“提起营养钵，花工一大拖，是否能增产，还是无把握”。在这严重关头，我们又依靠广大群众，并动员全体机关干部，开展了“一人一担水，救活移栽苗”运动，经过三天组织二千余人次的连续战斗，战胜了干旱，胜利地度过了这一难关。由于营养钵有充分的养料，棉苗很快就全部转了青，早晚不同，日夜变样。在事实面前，曾一度抬头的“失败论”终于烟消云散了。
    这种反复的思想斗争，直至棉花现蕾时才缓和下来。试验区的棉花长得特别茁壮齐整，犹如一片绿色海洋，并且比一般田早二十天现蕾。此时，一贯保守的人，也心服口服了，承认我们以前没有一桩事情是搞“瞎”了的。社员们的心更像被磁铁吸住一般，无时无刻不想到田里去看一看，一到田里干起来了就不忍释手，越干越有劲。有五十多个男女社员要求固定在试验区里搞生产，把试验区当成自己的
  “私有田”。后来棉花丰收了，老人们笑得合不拢嘴，青年们乐得蹦蹦跳跳。游天秀、王家凤等三十几个棉花姑娘恳求说：“把棉花试验区一辈子都放在这里吧！”说出了广大社员心里要说的话。
    在试验过程中，我们还建立了三亩中心试验田，凡是要采用的新技术，都先从这块田作起，证明是成功的，就推广到整个试验区，以至全县。这三亩中心试验田历年收成少，也不是出棉地。当时我们本着大胆试验、摸索前进的精神，通过这一系列的措施，棉花生长始终跑在其他田的前头。
    我们搞试验田后，很多群众也跟着搞起来了，有民兵的、青年的、姑娘的、红领巾的、老婆婆的、老头子的，各取了各的名字，并提出
  “赶县委、超县委”的口号，把试验区当成了战场。胡启昆、胡启文、李可秀三个少年，经过数次要求，在县委试验田对面搞起了一块四分地的试验田。起初他们不会种，就请了团支部书记朱家远同志担任指导员，并且和我们比着干，我们干什么，他们也干什么，很少离了一回的。看了下肥，他们还闹着要多下点。经过与大人们同样的苦干，他们实现了自己的志愿，验收结果，四分田足足收了三百二十斤皮棉，被人们称赞为“棉花试验区里的小英雄”。大家都动手搞起来后，老年人也憋不住气了，老汉曹道生约了曹道洪等五个老汉也搞了一块
  “老黄忠”试验田。但办起来后，他们对新技术的接受是比较慢的，到了整枝打杈时，他们凭老经验没有打，可是过不了几天，别的田里亮堂堂的，通风透风，青枝绿叶，自己田里又枯又黄。这下他们慌起来了，但又不好意思问是怎么个打法，就不分青红皂白，跑到田里猛打猛折，不到半天工夫，棉花有的成了“光秆司令”，有的却更形枯萎。这时他们深深地感到光凭自己的老经验是吃不开了，才急忙向人家请教，学技术。自此以后也就学着人家干起来了，现在也获得了丰收。
    通过一系列的思想斗争，和由领导到群众的大搞试验田，有力地发动了群众，解放了思想，提高了群众对实施各项新技术的认识，为推广新的技术措施扫清了思想障碍；同时，每一个新技术措施的试验成功又对群众起了巨大的教育作用。
  及时连续地抓技术措施
    在技术措施上，除了作好土地平整、肥料准备、开辟水源等基本建设外，我们主要是坚决、及时、连续地抓好了以下六个关键问题：
        一、狠抓深、密、肥
    深：在麦收后用双铧犁深耕六——八寸，深的达一点二尺，一般耕三道耙四道，部分田耕了八道。
    密：密植一般在四千株左右，也有少数在四千株以下和达到六千株的，行距一点四——一点六尺，株距零点八——一点一尺。从实践结果来看，以四千株左右为宜。
    肥：我们在指导思想上是以底肥为主，追肥次之。底肥是以含有机质迟效性肥料为主，并混合适量的磷肥，分层施足。在割麦后铺施了混合肥和栏肥五百担，深耕翻入土内，接着在新土上面施了饼肥四百斤和混合肥四百担，进行四寸左右的浅翻深耙。田整平后，移栽时再以颗粒肥和饼三百斤，打壋施肥。这样，使得棉株根系的发育可以层层获得营养，不致脱肥、冲肥。
    二、精细处理种子，适当早播
    种子处理首先经过粒选和三、五天晒种，溴化钾十五天熏蒸，赛力散拌种半月密封，防止病虫害。在播种前用八十度温水浸种催芽。这些对保证棉苗健壮和增强抵抗灾害能力都有显著功效。
    适当早播和适时播种，对于棉花丰收有直接影响。我们播种早在春分，迟在立夏，最低温度为摄氏十一度，最高为二十一度。据观察，早播的棉苗前期易受气候和病虫袭击，但后期抵抗能力强；现蕾吐絮要早于立夏播种的一个月，每株伏桃平均五十个左右，约多于立夏播种的十五个，产量要高于迟播的30％左右。
  三、狠抓田间管理
    1、开沟作厢：为了防止内渍，便于操作，全部开成厢宽六——八尺，围沟宽一尺、深八寸，中沟宽八寸、深六寸的宽厢深沟，基本上实现了园田化。
    2、追肥：一律穴施，少吃多餐，方法是五追四补。五追：一是移栽后用水粪二十担点浇，促使钵土分裂，与田土融和；二是棉苗转青后用五十斤硫酸铵进行提苗；三是用腐熟豆饼五十斤，混合过磷酸钙三十斤，挖壋二寸深施肥，然后中耕培土掩盖，供给盛花期养料；四是用水粪二十担混合硫酸铵十五斤，在开花初期追肥，补给盛花期养料；五是追桃肥，每亩硫酸铵二十斤、水粪二十担。四补：一是苗期看田看苗用化肥十到二十斤提小苗赶大苗；二是从开花到收花，每隔三、五天用3％的比例进行叶面追施磷肥；三是从现蕾到收花循环往复喷射萘乙酸钠；四是挖补追肥，求得株株发育平衡，促使平衡增产。从棉花生长发育情况来看，抓住提苗、盛花期前、盛花期、结桃中期追肥，就能满足棉花几个主要发育时期对肥料的需要；通过几补的办法，促使生长平衡，保蕾、保桃，增结秋桃，使棉桃更加饱满。
    3、中耕与培土：中耕时掌握由浅入深，由深到浅和逐步培土加高的原则，留出离棉株二、三寸的保护带，作到没有板结、杂草，并要深锄秋草。试验区普遍中耕七次，一直延续到吐絮。延续中耕，能争取一部分秋桃。
    4、整枝打杈：密植后普遍株高棵大，叶茂、盘密、桃多，因此，及时作好整枝打杈，对增产就尤显重要。在这方面要突出作好脱裤腿、摸赘芽、摘旁尖、剪空枝、去老叶等项工作。
    5、晚打顶心：打顶心问题与促进棉花生长，争取秋桃，提高产量，有很大的直接关系。我们是分别不同情况进行的，如肥厚的晚打或不打，肥薄的早打或迟些打，叶色深绿的晚打，叶面发黄的早些打。在“秋分”开的花，因温度（摄氏二十二度左右）适宜，能同样受精、同样成熟，还可收到棉花。据观察，晚打二十天的棉株，每株桃子要比早打顶心的多十个左右。由此可见，根据生长情况，晚打或不打顶心是有好处的。
      四、坚决彻底地灭虫治病
    为了彻底地消灭病虫害，确保增产，在播种前就用“一六零五”把试验区周围所有易于藏虫的花草树木杀治了一遍，从苗期到蕾铃期连续用“一六零五”、“一零五九”或“二二三”乳剂，彻底消灭了芽虫、红蜘蛛、盲椿象、叶跳虫、红铃虫，以及最凶恶的斜纹夜盗蛾等六大虫害。直至拔棉秆为止，共防虫十七次，治病四次，少数田防虫达二十三次。
          五、加强后期管理
    怎样延长棉花生长时期，使棉田通风透光、防止落铃落蕾烂桃，是增产的重大关键。因此早在7、8月间雨水过多、棉株生长旺盛，赘芽很多的时候，就及时地进行了摸芽，防止疯枝生长造成田间荫蔽的危害。8月以后果枝增多，我们在田里用竹竿搭起了架子，进行了推株并行工作，狠狠地防治了后期病虫，不断地进行了叶面追肥，使棉苗保持了旺盛的生命力，生长期比一般田延长了二十天左右，增结了秋桃。
          六、营养钵育苗
    用营养钵育苗，经验证明有很大优越性。与播的苗相比，具有株高、叶大、桃多、分量重、抵抗灾害力强的特点。在同样的条件下，钵育的苗八十个棉桃能收一斤籽花，而条播的却是一百至一百一十个才有一斤。社员们说：
   “条播不用说，产量差一着；明年全用钵，千亩不嫌多。”
    有把握争取今年更高产
    在一年的生产实践中，我们积累了一些经验，但也有不少的教训。我们体会较深的主要经验是：解放思想，破除迷信，狠狠抓住深、肥、密、壮四关，抓好全面综合技术措施，抓好田间管理，一环套一环，环环套紧；在思想指导上，要抓早、抓好、抓到底，不收花就不松手。
    主要的问题是：深耕还不突出，底肥不够足，氮、磷、钾配合不够恰当，未全部采用营养钵，有少数田播得较晚，加上水灾的袭击，这些都在不同程度上造成了减收。我们相信，只要很好地堵塞这些漏洞，继续钻研，采用新技术，棉花一定还有很大的增产潜力，争取更高的产量是有充分把握的。
