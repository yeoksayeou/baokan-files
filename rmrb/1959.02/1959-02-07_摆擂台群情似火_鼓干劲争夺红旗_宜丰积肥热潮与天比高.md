This dispatch from Nanchang, February 6th, reports that in Yifeng County, Jiangxi Province, the county secretary has taken the lead, with everyone participating in manure accumulation. Through the "Four Comparisons" competition – comparing drive, tool innovation, quantity, and quality – the movement is being continuously pushed to a new climax. According to recent verification statistics, all nineteen people's communes and reclamation farms in the county have accumulated over 120 million dan of various natural, farmyard, and soil-based fertilizers in less than twenty days, averaging 400 dan of fertilizer per mu of cultivated land, 60% more than the total amount of manure accumulated throughout the entire year of the previous year.

Yifeng County is a semi-mountainous and hilly area with few people and abundant land. Because winter production and various other tasks are busy, many cadres and masses felt that labor could not be spared, and they had a slow-motion mentality towards manure accumulation and production. In response to this situation, the county party committee immediately organized cadres and masses to start by inspecting production plans and measures, and launched a large-scale debate on manure accumulation by calculating time and tasks, thereby clarifying that the current task of manure accumulation and production is an urgent one. At the same time, it required party committee secretaries at all levels to personally take charge and take emergency measures to establish manure accumulation teams. On the one hand, it rationally arranged the labor force engaged in agriculture and sideline production in each commune and reclamation farm, and transferred 60% of the people to participate in manure accumulation; on the other hand, it tapped labor potential and tried to draw people from collective welfare departments to participate in manure accumulation. Elderly and young commune members and urban residents also participated in manure accumulation to the best of their ability, and government cadres, factory and enterprise workers, and school teachers and students also participated in manure accumulation in addition to ensuring their work and study. In this way, a manure accumulation army of more than 36,000 people was quickly established throughout the county, forming 659 professional teams and shock brigades, focusing on large-scale digging (digging pond mud), large-scale composting (chopping grass for composting), large-scale burning (burning fire soil ash), and large-scale production (producing soil-based fertilizer), making great efforts in manure accumulation and production.

During the manure accumulation movement, the first secretaries of the county, township, and brigade party committees and branch secretaries personally went to the front line, participating in and leading manure accumulation on a piece-by-piece basis. A "Four Comparisons" competition – comparing drive, tool innovation, quantity, and quality – was launched between communes, farms, teams, and individuals. The Tangpu People's Commune, where Fei Qingzhang, the first secretary of the county party committee, was located, took the lead in setting up a "stage" to challenge all communes and reclamation farms in the county. After the "stage" was set up, it immediately received responses from all communes and reclamation farms. Now everyone is working with soaring enthusiasm, and every commune refuses to fall behind. In order to complete the challenge plan on time and with high quality, the pond mud digging shock brigade of Tangpu Commune studied ways to improve labor efficiency overnight, rushed to build more than 20 ox-drawn flatbed carts,土 trains (probably a small rail car of some kind), and 37 wooden cranes for hoisting mud, and implemented a hook-rod method of dumping soil. Many commune members went into the pond barefoot to carry soil and dig mud, striving to carry more and run faster; some women and semi-able-bodied laborers also refused to lag behind. This commune averaged more than 600 dan of pond mud dug and transported per person per day, and some commune members even created a high record of more than 1,000 dan. Commune members who cut thatch for composting were led up the mountain by the county party secretary, cutting thorns and thatch during the day, and sleeping in dilapidated temples at night, persisting on the front line even when it rained. Tangpu Commune accumulated and produced a total of 4,862,200 dan of fertilizer in seven days, overfulfilling the original plan, and the quality also met the standards, so it was rated as a model for the county. Other communes and reclamation farms have put forward the fighting slogan of "Learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and never stop until we get the red flag." The Xinzhuang Commune, neighboring Tangpu, sent the party committee secretary to Tangpu Commune to learn from experience. After returning, it vigorously carried out tool innovation, promoted ox-drawn carts, 土 trains, 土 cranes, and also created many new digging and transportation tools such as mud transportation slides, ox-drawn fertilizer transportation boats, and ox-drawn soil shoveling buckets. In addition to short distances using human carrying, most of the manure was transported using animal power and tools. In this way, Xinzhuang Commune quickly surpassed Tangpu Commune, reaching 850 dan of manure accumulation per person per day. The competition between teams and individuals is also very enthusiastic. At the beginning of the manure accumulation, the Xiliu Brigade of Jiangzhou Commune was the last in the entire commune. The commune members checked the reasons, improved labor organization, and emphasized the quality of manure accumulation, and quickly caught up. Cai Bosheng of the Shangmeitian Team of Tianbao Reclamation Farm postponed his wedding to participate in manure accumulation. He said, "One dan of fertilizer is one dan of grain, more people means more strength, and marriage can be sooner or later."

Urban government cadres, school teachers and students, workers, and residents are also very enthusiastic about accumulating and producing manure. Yifeng County established a "Fertilizer Thorough Cleanup Committee." An average of 2,000 people compete to dig ditches, pond mud, and garbage every day. Many cadres and workers accumulate manure during the day and work at night; teachers and students participate in manure accumulation as soon as class is over. The purchasing and supply station and supply and marketing department of Tangpu Commune jointly established a manure accumulation team, divided into three groups, leaving one group to operate the business.

Now, the piles of fertilizer in the fields everywhere in the county are like small mountains, and every field has dug composting pits, so that the pits are large and full of fertilizer. More than 200土 fertilizer plants have been established, producing more than 90,000 jin of 土 fertilizer per day. (Ma Zhongming)

    摆擂台群情似火　鼓干劲争夺红旗
    宜丰积肥热潮与天比高
    本报南昌6日电　江西省宜丰县书记挂帅，人人积肥，通过比干劲、比工具改革、比数量、比质量的“四比”竞赛，把运动不断推向高潮。据最近验收统计，全县十九个人民公社和垦殖场，在不到二十天的时间，已经积造各种自然肥、农家肥和土化肥一亿二千多万担，平均每亩耕地有肥四百担，比去年全年的积肥量多60％。
    宜丰县是个人少田多的半山半丘陵地区，因为冬季生产和各项工作繁忙，所以许多干部和群众认为劳力摆不开，对积肥造肥存在着慢慢来的思想。针对这种情况，县委立即组织干部和群众从检查生产计划和措施入手，通过算时间、算任务开展了积肥大辩论，从而明确当前积肥造肥是个迫切任务。同时，要求各级党委书记亲自挂帅，采取紧急措施建立积肥队伍。一方面，将各公社、垦殖场从事农业和副业的劳动力进行合理安排，抽调60％的人参加积肥；一方面，挖掘劳动潜力，在集体福利部门尽量抽人参加积肥。老幼社员和城镇居民也尽力所能及参加积肥，机关干部、工厂企业职工、学校师生除保证业务和学习外，也参加积肥。这样，在全县范围内迅速建立了一支三万六千多人的积肥大军，分别组成六百五十九个专业队和突击队，以大挖（挖塘泥）、大沤（铲草沤肥）、大烧（烧火土灰）、大造（造土化肥）为主，大闹积肥造肥。
    积肥运动中，县、乡、大队党委第一书记和支部书记都亲临前线，逐级划片包干参加和领导积肥。在社与社、场与场、队与队、人与人之间开展了比干劲、比工具改革、比数量、比质量的“四比”竞赛。县委第一书记费庆章所在的棠浦人民公社首先摆起“擂台”向全县各公社和垦殖场挑战。“擂台”摆开后，立刻得到了各公社和垦殖场的响应，现在人人干劲冲天，社社不肯落后。棠浦社为了按时按质完成挑战计划，挖塘泥的突击队，连夜研究提高劳动效率的办法，赶制了二十多部牛拉大板车、土火车和三十七部吊泥用的木制起重机，并且实行了钩杆倒土法。许多社员赤脚下塘挑土、挖泥，力争多挑快跑；一些妇女和半劳力也不甘落后。这个社每天每人平均挖运塘泥达到了六百多担，有些社员还创造了一千多担的高纪录。割茅沤肥的社员，由县委书记带领上山，白天斩荆割茅，夜晚睡在破庙里，下雨也坚持不下火线。棠浦社在七天中共积肥造肥四百八十六万二千多担，超额完成了原定计划，质量也合标准，因此被评为全县的模范。其他公社和垦殖场纷纷提出了“学先进，赶先进，不取红旗不罢休”的战斗口号。棠浦邻近的新庄公社派党委书记到棠浦社取经，回来后大搞工具改革，推广了牛拉车、土火车、土起重机，还创造了运泥滑道、牛拉运肥船、牛拉铲土斗等许多新的挖运工具，除近距离使用人挑外，大部使用畜力和工具运肥。这样，新庄社很快地便超过了棠浦社，达到每天每人积肥八百五十担。队与队、人与人之间的竞赛也很热烈。江洲公社西刘大队开始积肥是全社最后的一名，社员们检查了原因，改进劳动组织和强调积肥质量，很快赶了上去。天宝垦殖场上梅天队蔡柏生推迟婚期参加积肥，他说：“一担肥一担粮，多一人多分力，结婚迟早都可以。”
    城镇机关干部、学校师生、职工、居民积肥造肥也非常踊跃。宜丰县城成立了“肥料彻底清理委员会”，平均每天有二千人比赛挖阴沟、塘泥、垃圾，许多干部、职工，白天积肥，晚上工作；教师、学生一下课就参加积肥。棠浦社采购供应站和供销部联合成立了一个积肥队，分成三个小组，留一个组营业。
    现在，全县各处田间的肥料堆像一座座小山，丘丘田都挖了沤肥窖，做到了窖大肥满。并且建立了二百多个土化肥厂，日产土化肥九万多斤。　（马锺明）
