    Exposing the Decay of American Imperialism
    After reading the article "Missile Failures, Profits Soar" from the American "Worker's Weekly," reprinted in the People's Daily on February 16th, we have a deeper understanding of the decay of American imperialism. The bosses on Wall Street are fighting fiercely for profits, vying with each other and crushing each other. As the article says, "Profit is the guide for missile manufacturers," and the failure of missiles also "means profit."
    We hope that more such articles will be selected and published in the future, as this will help us understand the essence of imperialism. Chen Da

    揭露出美帝国主义的腐朽
    看了人民日报2月16日转载的美国“工人周报”的“导弹失败，利润激增”一文后，我们更加深刻地认识到美帝国主义的腐朽。华尔街的老板们为了利润，你争我夺，相互倾轧。正如文中所说：“利润是导弹制造商的指导”，导弹的失败也“意味着利润”。
    我们希望以后多选刊这样的文章，这对于我们了解帝国主义的本质，是有帮助的。　陈达
