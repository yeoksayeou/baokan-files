    Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, February 24th: The Iraqi Ministry of Economy announced its opposition to the US suggestion to conclude an agreement with Iraq regarding American investment in Iraq. It pointed out that Iraq would derive no benefit from concluding this agreement with the United States.

    The agreement suggested by the United States would give the US government the right to interfere in matters concerning American citizens' investments in Iraq, and also stipulate that the US government should resolve all problems and disputes arising from private American investment. The US-proposed agreement stipulates that disputes be resolved through government negotiations or through arbitration by persons agreed upon by both parties. If the two parties cannot agree on the choice of arbitrator, the President of the International Court of Justice shall make the selection.

    The Ministry of Economy announced that a special committee established to discuss the American proposal, after holding meetings, concluded that the agreement includes unacceptable principles that were prevalent during the era of foreign privileges and that it contradicts the policy and independence of the Republic of Iraq. It does not conform to the concept of subordinating private economics to national economic policy, a policy that the Iraqi government implements to develop the national economy on a scientific basis and in accordance with the principles that serve Iraqi and Arab interests.

    The Ministry of Economy said that it believes that the proposed arbitration principles contradict all Iraqi laws and regulations. It emphasized the principle of judicial independence and autonomy.

    The Ministry of Economy pointed out that the agreement suggested by the United States violates the economic policy of the Republic of Iraq, which is based on complete independence and prohibits any foreign interference in Iraq's economic policy.

    伊拉克不许美国资本享有特权
    美国提出同伊拉克缔结投资协定的要求遭拒绝
    新华社巴格达24日电  伊拉克经济部宣布反对美国建议要和伊拉克缔结的关于美国人在伊拉克投资的协定。它指出，伊拉克同美国缔结这个协定没有任何好处。
    美国建议的协定将使美国政府对于有关美国公民在伊拉克的投资有权插手，并且还规定要由美国政府来解决由于美国私人的投资所造成的一切问题和争端。美国建议的协定规定，争端通过政府谈判或者通过双方所同意的人的仲裁来解决。如果双方对于仲裁人人选不能取得一致意见，就由国际法庭庭长来选择。
    经济部宣布，为了讨论美国的这个建议而成立的一个特别委员会在举行会议后认为，协定包括了一些曾经盛行于外国享有特权的时代的不能接受的原则，它是同伊拉克共和国的政策和独立相矛盾的。它不符合使私人经济从属于国家经济政策的概念，伊拉克政府执行这种政策，以便在科学基础上以及符合伊拉克和阿拉伯的利益的原则下来发展国家经济。
    经济部说，它认为所建议的仲裁原则是同伊拉克的一切法律和规定相矛盾的。它强调司法独立自主的原则。
    经济部指出，美国建议的协定违背了伊拉克共和国的经济政策，这个政策是以完全独立和不准任何外国干涉伊拉克的经济政策为基础的。
