Tianjin, February 3rd (This newspaper) – The Tianjin Third Construction Engineering Company, while striving for high speed, has tightly grasped quality and established and improved a series of rules and regulations to ensure quality. It has achieved an overall "more, faster, better, and more economical" leap forward and has also won the red flags for both quality and rapid construction in the Hebei Province construction industry.

Last year, the company completed its annual total output value leap forward plan two months ahead of schedule. Costs were reduced by 22% compared to the previous year. The quality of more than 310,000 square meters of construction was all rated excellent or qualified, serious quality accidents were eliminated, and general quality accidents were also greatly reduced. Key projects completed rapidly by the company were all completed in the same year and have stood the test of practical use. The No. 2 Steelmaking Plant of the Tianjin Steel Plant is a large factory building with more than 13,000 square meters, eight stories high, and entirely reinforced concrete. It was originally planned to be completed in one year, but it was completed in just over four months. Since it was put into production in October last year, ten 15-ton to 50-ton cranes have been operating on the roof trusses of this building, and trains have been passing through the factory building, but the factory building is very stable and no cracks or deformation have occurred. The 6,000-ton capacity cold storage built for the Ministry of Food Industry is a large project with complex structures and high technical requirements for heat insulation and moisture protection. It was built in only 86 days, and the user unit believes that its construction speed and quality are the best in the country.

The Party Committee of this company continuously conducts "more, faster, better, and more economical" education for employees through specific construction tasks. For example, when accepting the basic construction task of the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant of the Tianjin Steel Plant, in order to enable this new steel plant to produce steel ahead of schedule, the company's party and government leaders proposed a plan to shorten the construction period by more than 50%. At that time, some people believed that the basic construction tasks of such large enterprises could not be carried out quickly, and it would be difficult to ensure quality if it was too fast. The Party Committee mobilized the masses to conduct in-depth discussions on whether the quality of large-scale enterprise construction can be ensured while striving for high speed. After many veteran workers and technicians answered this question affirmatively, they put forward many methods to ensure both speed and quality. As a result, the construction period was shortened by more than seven months, and the quality fully met the standards.

The Party Committee of the company also launched a campaign to improve quality and oppose waste, making the idea of "more, faster," but also "better, and more economical" deeply rooted in people's hearts and formed a good atmosphere. Workers consciously implement the system of self-inspection, self-acceptance, mutual inspection, and mutual acceptance.

The company once mobilized the masses to break more than 20 impractical rules and regulations that did not conform to the "more, faster, better, and more economical" principle. At the same time, it strengthened and improved the necessary rules and regulations and formulated new management systems and technical measures based on the new construction situation. The company recognizes that revolutionary enthusiasm must be combined with scientific analysis, and the more intense and rapid construction is carried out, the more necessary measures and systems must be followed up. They stipulate that on key construction sites, not only must construction personnel study the drawings in advance, but also design personnel and construction personnel must hold technical research meetings. Both parties should discuss and solve possible problems between design and construction so that the design is more in line with the construction situation and the construction can better meet the design requirements. They also stipulate that steel bars and cement must undergo strict compression and tensile tests before reinforced concrete can be poured, and concrete components must be subjected to accurate strength calculations before they can be hoisted. A series of original management systems and technical measures have been strengthened: the responsibility system such as construction diaries and operation records has been improved. Everyone from the construction site to the team must record the operation time, situation, and names on their notebooks or on the components they have made. This enhances the sense of responsibility of all construction personnel and ensures quality. The material pre-inspection and pre-acceptance system and the hidden project inspection system have been consolidated. In construction operations, the self-inspection and self-acceptance of the workers and the professional inspection of the technicians are combined. All laboratories have greatly increased testing equipment and instruments and have newly opened a laboratory. Last year, the company adopted dozens of alternative materials such as glued wood, plywood, furnace ash, and slag. These materials have undergone strict chemical analysis and physical testing, and their specifications, proportions, and operating procedures have been carefully determined before production and use are organized. Alternative materials are generally not used in load-bearing beam structure parts.

The company also actively trained a technical workforce during the project, and electricians and mechanical hoisting workers increased from three or four to more than eighty. They also launched a versatile movement, which solved the shortage of rebar workers and concrete workers. In the busy and intense construction, small-scale experience exchange meetings, observation performances, and visits and learning have never been interrupted. Senior professional workers often worked together to study and solve many large and small problems in construction operations, which finally formed a technical research meeting with the participation of leaders and technicians.

This year, the company has determined that it will further reduce costs on the premise of further improving quality, fully promote rapid construction, and achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization, to achieve more advanced indicators than last year.

    天津第三建筑工程公司实现全面跃进
    质量速度齐插红旗
    主要经验是：大搞群众运动，同时健全管理制度
    本报天津3日电　天津市第三建筑工程公司在力争高速度的同时，紧紧抓住了质量，并建立和健全了一系列保证质量的规章制度，实现了“多快好省”的全面大跃进，同时获得了河北省建筑业质量和快速施工的两面红旗。
    这个公司去年提前两个月完成了全年总产值跃进计划，成本比前年降低22％，三十一万多平方公尺建筑的质量全部为优级和合格，杜绝了严重的质量事故，一般质量事故也大大减少。这个公司快速施工完成的重点工程，全部在当年竣工，而且在实用中经受住了考验。天津钢厂第二炼钢厂是有一万三千多平方公尺、八层楼高、全部钢筋混凝土结构的大型厂房，原计划一年完工，但结果只用了四个多月就建成了。自去年10月投入生产以来，十部十五吨到五十吨的天车在这个建筑物的屋架上开动，火车从厂房中穿行，但厂房十分安稳，没有发生任何裂纹变形的情形。为食品工业部建筑的容量六千吨的冷藏库，是一项结构复杂、隔热防潮等技术要求高的大工程，只用了八十六天就建成了，使用单位认为它的建设速度和质量都是全国第一流的。
    这个公司的党委会，不断地通过具体施工任务，对职工进行“多快好省”的教育。例如在接受天津钢厂第二炼钢厂的基本建设任务时，为了使这个新建的钢厂提前出钢，公司的党政领导提出了缩短工期50％以上的计划。当时有人认为像这样大型企业的基建任务不能快速施工，要快了就很难保证质量。党委会发动群众就大型企业的建筑在力争高速度的同时，能否确保质量的问题，进行了深入的讨论。很多老工人和技术人员肯定地回答了这一问题以后，并提出很多保证又快又好的办法。结果，工期缩短了七个多月，质量完全合乎标准。
    公司的党委会还发动群众掀起了提高质量反对浪费的运动，使既要“多、快”又要“好、省”的思想深入人心，形成了风气。工人都自觉地执行自检自验和互检互验的制度。
    这个公司曾经发动群众破了二十多项不切实际、不符合“多快好省”的规章制度，但同时加强和健全了必要的规章制度，并且根据新的施工情况制订了新的管理制度和技术措施。这个公司认识到革命干劲要和科学分析结合起来，越是大搞紧张的快速施工，越要把必要的措施、制度跟上去。他们规定，在重点工地上，不仅施工人员必须事先学习图纸，而且设计人员和施工人员要开技术研究会，双方一起磋商解决设计和施工间可能发生的问题，使设计更符合施工情况，使施工能更好地达到设计要求。他们还规定了钢筋、水泥必须经过严格的抗压、拉力等试验才许浇铸钢筋混凝土，混凝土构件必须作精确的强度计算后才许吊装。一系列原有的管理制度和技术措施加强了：施工日记和操作记录等责任制度健全了，从工地到小组，每个人都要在本子上或自己作好的构件上记下操作时间、情况和人名，这样增强了全体施工人员的责任心，保证了质量。材料的预检预验制度、隐敝工程的检验制度等都得到了巩固。在施工操作中，工人群众的自检自验和技术人员的专业检查结合了起来。所有试验室都大量增加了试验设备和仪器，并新开辟了一个试验室。去年这个公司采用了胶合木、胶合板、炉灰、矿渣等几十种代用材料。这些材料都经过严格的化学分析和物理检验，仔细地确定它的规格、配合比例、操作规程后才组织生产和使用。在承受重力的房梁结构部分一般不采取代用材料。
    这个公司还在工程进行中积极培训了一支技术工种队伍，电焊工人和机械吊装工人从三、四个人增加到八十多人。还大搞多面手运动，解决了钢筋工人和混凝土工人缺少的困难。在繁忙紧张的施工中，小型经验交流会、观摩表演和参观学习等一直没有中断过。老专业工人更常常在一起研究，解决了很多施工操作中大大小小的问题，最后形成了有领导人员和技术人员共同参加的技术研究会议。
    今年，这个公司确定：将在进一步提高质量的前提下，更多地降低成本，全部推行快速施工和实现机械化半机械化，以达到比去年更先进的指标。
