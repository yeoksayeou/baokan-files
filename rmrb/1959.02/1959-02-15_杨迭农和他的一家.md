    Yang Dienong and His Family
    By Our Correspondent Pan Yuguo
    Living at the foot of Leigong Mountain, in Yangpai Village, Danjiang People's Commune, Leishan County, the Miao family of Yang Dienong, like many Miao families, is full of cheerfulness, joy, and vitality.
    Yang Dienong's courtyard is planted with all kinds of flowers and plants, fresh and elegant. Yang Dienong is a herbal doctor loved by the masses, and these flowers and plants are the herbs he cultivates. He is now a researcher at the Leishan County Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine and a doctor in the commune. Sixty-three-year-old Yang Dienong learned to treat illnesses with herbs at the age of twenty-eight, but he only began to sincerely practice medicine and enthusiastically treat patients after liberation. Before liberation, the local landlords looked down on him, this poor doctor, saying he was a swindler. In a fit of anger, he gave up this valuable profession. After liberation, Yang Dienong restarted using herbs to treat people. In the spring of 1958, he attended the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture Traditional Chinese Medicine Representatives Conference, exchanged many experiences with colleagues from other regions, and became even more active after returning to the commune. He often climbed the more than 1,800-meter-high Leigong Mountain at the cost of great effort to dig up wild herbs and plant them at home for immediate use. He also took on several apprentices to pass on his medical experience to the younger generation. People in the Danjiang area can often see this old man carrying a small medicine box, running around everywhere, treating people. Last year, he cured more than a hundred patients, many of whom suffered from relatively difficult to treat diseases, such as ascites and bladder stones.
    Yang Dienong's family is a hospitable one. When Yang Dienong led the reporter into his house, an old Miao woman, several middle-aged Miao women, and two children were sitting around the fire. As soon as they saw the guests, they quickly offered seats and water.
    Yang Dienong told the reporter, "We are holding a family meeting to discuss how to keep the oxen healthy over the winter! I am responsible for taking care of the health of the oxen." Only then did I realize that they were holding a family meeting! Around the charcoal fire, the women of Yang Dienong's family talked and laughed, introducing the great leap forward situation and work achievements of their whole family to the reporter.
    Yang Dienong's wife, Mo Houjiao, said, "Don't look at him as a sixty-odd-year-old herbal doctor, he is also very good at production. Last year, during the deep plowing of the land, others could only plow three mu of land a day at most, but he plowed five mu, and the quality also met the standards." Praising her husband like this in front of guests was unimaginable among Miao women before liberation.
    Speaking of the old man's eldest son, Yang Yuyong, the old man said with a smile, "This child, ah, doesn't stay at home all day, I don't even know where he is, sometimes in the fields, sometimes on the water conservancy construction site, sometimes in the canteen, anyway, he is among the masses."
    Yang Yuyong served as the chairman of the farmers' association security committee, mutual aid group leader, agricultural cooperative director, and Party branch secretary after liberation. In his words, he serves socialism and communism under the leadership of the Party. In the early days of liberation, when the counter-revolutionary activities of landlords and rich peasants were still rampant, he led the masses and fought the enemy at the risk of his life. Today, he works day and night for the production of the commune and the improvement of the people's lives. In recent years, due to his active work, he has been repeatedly rated as a model worker in the commune, township, county, and autonomous prefecture.
    According to the old rules, Miao youths would separate from their families as soon as they got married, for fear that sisters-in-law would not get along, causing family disputes; but now, this three-generation, nine-member family has become more and more harmonious and united after the communization. With their children by their side, they no longer worry about their lives being taken away by hunger and disease; husbands and wives work together, produce together, and entertain together. The elders are very kind to their daughters-in-law, and the daughters-in-law respect and take care of the elders in every possible way. Not a single member of the family wants this family to separate.
    The old man is very satisfied with his family. Among the seven adults in the family, six were elected as models in the Great Leap Forward. Although the eldest daughter-in-law was not elected as a model, she is also an activist in production. In short, this family is full of unity, harmony, and vigorous vitality.

    杨迭农和他的一家
    本报记者　潘玉国
    居住在雷公山下，雷山县丹江人民公社羊排村的苗族杨迭农家，像许多苗族家庭一样，这个家庭每一个成员都心情舒畅，喜气洋洋，充满了朝气。
    杨迭农家的院子，栽满了各种各样的花草，清新优雅。杨迭农是群众爱戴的草药医生，这些花草都是他培植的草药。他现在正担任雷山县中医研究所的研究员和公社的医生。六十三岁的杨迭农，在二十八岁时就学会了用草药治病，可是，他真心行医，热情给病人治病还是解放以后才开始的。解放前，当地地主瞧不起他这个穷郎中，说他是骗钱的。他一气之下，就丢开了这门可贵的职业。解放后杨迭农重新开始了用草药为人治病。1958年春天，他出席了黔东南苗族侗族自治州中医代表会议，和其他地区的同行交流了许多经验，回社后就更加积极起来。他常常不辞辛苦地爬上一千八百多公尺高的雷公山上挖回野生药草栽在家里，好随时使用。他还带了几个徒弟，把自己的医病经验传授给年青一代。丹江地区的人们经常可以看到这位老人背着一个小药箱到处奔走，为人治病。去年他治好一百多个病人，其中有许多人患的是比较难治的病，如腹水、膀胱结石等。
    杨迭农家是个好客的人家，当杨迭农把记者引进他家房子时，一位苗族老太太、几位中年苗家妇女和两个小孩子，正围在火边。她们一发现客人来了，连忙让坐送水。
    杨迭农告诉记者说，“我们正在开家庭会讨论耕牛过冬问题哩！我负责照顾耕牛健康”。这我才知道他们正在开家庭会议呢！围着炭火，杨迭农家的妇女们谈笑风生的向记者介绍了他们全家的跃进情况和工作成绩。
    杨迭农的老伴莫后姣说：“你别看他是六十多岁的草药郎中，生产也十分在行。去年深翻土地时，别人一天最多只能犁三亩地，他却犁了五亩，质量也合标准。”像这样在客人面前夸奖自己的丈夫，在解放前的苗族妇女中是不可想像的。
    谈起老人的大儿子杨玉勇，老人笑着说：“这孩子呀，成天不落家，在哪里，我也说不上，有时在田坝上，有时在水利工地上，有时又在食堂里，反正是在群众中。”
    杨玉勇在解放后担任过农会治安委员、互助组长、农业社主任、党支部书记，用他的话来说，就是在党的领导下，为社会主义、共产主义服务。在解放初，地主、富农的反革命活动还很猖狂的时候，他领导群众，冒着生命危险同敌人斗争。在今天，他又为着公社生产，改善群众生活而日夜不息地工作。几年来，由于他工作积极，曾连年被评为社、乡、县、自治州的工作模范和劳动模范。
    照老规矩，苗族青年一结婚就得分家，为的是怕姑嫂妯娌合不来，引起家庭纠纷；而现在，这个三代九口之家，在公社化以后却愈来愈和睦团结。孩子在自己身边，再也不担心被饥饿、疾病夺去他们的生命；丈夫和妻子一道劳动生产、共同娱乐，翁姑们对媳妇非常慈爱，媳妇对翁姑很尊敬并照顾备至。全家没有一个成员愿意这个家庭分居。
    老人对他的一家是十分满意的，全家七个成年人中，有六个在跃进中当选为模范，大媳妇虽没当选模范，可也是生产中的积极分子。总之，这个家庭里充满了团结和睦和蓬勃的朝气。
