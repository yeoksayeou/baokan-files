　　We admire the Soviet cartoons recently exhibited in Beijing.

　　Participating in this exhibition were six Soviet cartoonists and over a dozen cartoonists from the Leningrad "Combat Pencil" art group. The content consisted mostly of political satire. These works, like X-rays, penetrated layers of hypocritical appearances, revealing the decaying internal organs of the capitalist world and reactionary rulers. Soviet cartoonists are full of humor. They have mastered the art of satire, deeply grasping the contradictions of things and presenting them to the public in a concentrated way, making people smile knowingly and prompting deep thought. For example, in the painting "Plenipotentiary," Yefimov depicts the Kuomintang elements in the United Nations, who are not qualified to represent a country's people, as a short dwarf wearing an ill-fitting tuxedo, swaying among the legs of representatives from various countries. This ridiculous appearance makes people feel that such a thing, no matter how it is dressed up, can only play the role of a clown. In Litvinenko's "Wet Nurse," a group of fat monopoly capitalists are scrambling to suck the milk (gold coins) fed to them by war. In the fierce competition and mutual exclusion, these gentlemen have lost all "noble" demeanor. In Soifertis's "New Era," the "freedom" touted by the United States is subjected to sharp and profound satire. Look, the Statue of Liberty in New York has been pushed down, and a policeman holding a baton stands proudly on the empty seat. Shakespeare's famous play "Othello" is familiar to everyone. Millions of kind-hearted audiences have shed tears of sympathy for the death of the black hero Othello in the play. However, in Galiba's painting, Othello is hanged because of racial discrimination in the United States. It can be seen from these works that although the painters use exaggeration, people do not feel that this is an exaggerated description because they reveal the essence of things. Everyone knows that the purpose of the US and British governments in going to the Middle East is to plunder oil. Then, what is wrong with painting these two guys as oil drums (Yefimov's "Oil Zone Pilgrims")? The painter skillfully concentrates the contradictions (the representative's tuxedo and the dwarf's figure, the Statue of Liberty and the police suppressing freedom, etc.) on the screen, creating a ridiculous situation in which the enemy is embarrassed, further piercing their hypocritical faces and thoroughly exposing their ugly hearts, which can further arouse people's hatred and contempt for them.

　　At the same time, cartoonists have not relaxed their depiction of the other side. They sing praises of the people and socialism. In the painting "Red Army Lamb Skewers," Dolgorukov uses concise techniques (a string of enemy helmets pierced on a bayonet) to ridicule the White bandits and imperialists who once tried to extinguish the revolution by force. They were stripped of their armor under the counterattack of the Red Army, portraying the great image of the Red Army. The author showed his creative talent in the exhibited works: concise conception, bright and strong colors, and fully exerted the political and artistic effects of each painting. Enzeng's works are historical paintings selected from the "The Beginning and End of the Estonian Bourgeois State" painting collection. Standing in front of the works of these two painters, people seem to see the scene of the vigorous and arduous struggle forty years ago. Those moving scenes tell future generations what price the revolutionary ancestors paid to exchange for today's happy life! The propaganda paintings of the "Combat Pencil" art group have their own characteristics. It is a combination of cartoons and propaganda paintings. On the one hand, it is a combination of painters and poets. At the same time, these works have both the characteristics of cartoons and the eye-catching and attractive power of propaganda paintings, which are very popular among the masses and worthy of our learning.

　　From these works, we see the Soviet cartoonists' firm political stance and strong political enthusiasm. When people are moved by a painting and aroused emotional resonance, it proves that the painter has conveyed his emotions to the audience's hearts. To achieve this, it is impossible without correct Marxist-Leninist viewpoints, full confidence in the revolutionary cause, and extreme contempt for the enemy. Comrade Yefimov is fifty-nine years old this year and has been engaged in the fighting life of defending the Soviet regime since 1919. The other five comrades are also veterans who have fought with cartoons for more than twenty years. Long-term struggle has made them stronger and their artistic achievements greater and greater. Each of their works is painted so concisely, and the modeling, lines, colors, and composition are all meticulous. For example, in "Who Approves the American Proposal, Please Raise Your Hand!" Yefimov's depiction of the American master's arrogance and the servant's obsequiousness is penetrating; in "The God of French Justice," Soifertis vividly depicts the mental state of the traitor who served as a juror, making people feel that even the tone of his voice is painted out. In Galiba's "Othello," the inhuman smiling faces of the monopoly capitalists are also flesh and blood, not some abstract "bad guys"; in Litvinenko's "Poisonous Mushrooms After the Rain," each poisonous mushroom is carefully depicted... This shows the Soviet cartoonists' serious attitude towards creative labor and profound artistic cultivation; it is also for this reason that they have achieved ingenious conception, vivid writing, and infectious artistic effects.

　　Only when politics and art are closely integrated can great and educational works be produced. After seeing Soviet cartoons, we deeply understand this point. This is also something that we should especially learn from.

    讽刺的艺术
    方成　英韬
    我们怀着敬佩的心情，欣赏了最近在北京展出的苏联漫画。
    参加这次展出的是六位苏联漫画家和列宁格勒“战斗之笔”艺术组的十几位漫画家的作品，内容绝大部分是政治讽刺画。这些作品像X光一样，透过层层虚伪的外表，照出资本主义世界和反动统治者糜烂的五脏六腑。苏联漫画家是富于幽默感的。他们掌握了讽刺的艺术，深刻地抓住事物的矛盾，集中地展示在人们面前，使人哑然而笑，启人深思。如在“全权代表”这幅画里，叶菲莫夫把在联合国中没有任何资格代表一个国家的国民党分子，画成个矮小的侏儒，穿着极不合身的大礼服，在各国代表们的大腿丛中晃来晃去。这付可笑的样子使人感觉，这样的东西，不论怎样装扮，也只能充当小丑的角色。李特维年柯的“奶妈”这幅画里，一群肥肥胖胖的垄断资本家，正在抢着去吸吮战争喂给他们的乳汁（金元），在激烈的争夺和互相排挤中，这些老爷们已经失去了一切“高尚”的仪表。在索伊菲尔提斯的“新时代”里，对美国标榜的“自由”，作了尖锐深刻的讽刺。看吧，纽约的自由神像被推倒了，空座子上面傲然立着高举警棍的警察。莎士比亚的名剧“奥赛罗”是大家熟悉的，千千万万善良的观众，曾为剧中的黑人英雄奥赛罗的死，洒下同情之泪。然而在加里巴的画里，由于美国的种族歧视，奥赛罗受了绞刑。从这些作品看出：虽然画家们用的是夸张手法，但是人们并不感觉这是夸大的描写。因为他们揭发了事物的本质。谁都知道，美英政府到中东去的目的就是掠夺石油，那么，把这两个家伙画成油桶（叶菲莫夫的“石油区朝圣者”），哪一点委屈他们呢？画家巧妙地把矛盾（代表的大礼服和侏儒身材，自由神像和镇压自由的警察等）集中在画面上，造成使敌人狼狈的可笑的局面，进一步刺穿他们伪善的嘴脸，透彻地暴露出丑恶的心，这就更能激起人们对他们的仇视和鄙视。
    同时漫画家也没有放松对另一方面的表现。他们歌颂人民，歌颂社会主义。多尔戈鲁可夫在“红军串烤羊肉”画中，用简练的手法（刺刀上穿了一串敌人的帽盔）嘲笑了曾经用武力妄图扑灭革命的白匪和帝国主义者，在红军的反击下丢盔卸甲，刻划了红军伟大的形象。作者在展出的作品中表现了他的创作才能：构思精练，色彩鲜明强烈，充分发挥了每一幅画的政治、艺术效果。恩曾的作品是从“爱沙尼亚资产阶级国家的始末”画集选出的历史画。人们站在这两位画家的作品面前，仿佛看到四十年前轰轰烈烈艰苦斗争的情景，那些动人心魄的画面告诉后人，革命先辈们是用了什么代价才换来今天的幸福生活！“战斗之笔”艺术组的宣传画就另具特色，它是一种漫画和宣传画结合的形式，一方面是画家和诗人结合，同时这些作品既有漫画的特点，又有宣传画醒目吸引人的力量，很受群众欢迎，值得我们借鉴。
    从这些作品中，我们看到苏联漫画家们坚定的政治立场和强烈的政治热情。人们被一幅画打动了，激起情感的共鸣，那就证明画家已经把自己的情感传达到观众心上。能做到这一点，没有正确的马克思列宁主义观点、没有对革命事业的充分信心和对敌人的极度蔑视，是办不到的。叶菲莫夫同志今年五十九岁了，从1919年起就开始了保卫苏维埃政权的战斗生活。其他五位同志也都是用漫画战斗了二十年以上的老战士。长期的斗争，使他们越来越坚强，艺术成就也越来越大。他们的每一幅作品画得那么精练，造型、线条、色彩、构图都一丝不苟。如叶菲莫夫在“谁赞成美国建议，请举手！”中刻划的美国主子的骄横，仆从们的卑谄，无不深入骨里；索伊菲尔提斯在“法国司法之神”中把那个当了陪审员的卖国贼的心理状态描绘得十分生动，使人感觉连说话的声调都画出来了。在加里巴的“奥赛罗”中，垄断资本家那种毫无人性的笑脸也是有血有肉的，不是什么抽象的“坏人”；李特维年柯的“雨后毒蕈”中，对每一个毒蕈都作了精心刻划……这都表明苏联漫画家对创作劳动的严肃态度和深湛的艺术修养；也正由于这个原因才获得构思精妙、笔下传神、富有感染力的艺术效果。
    只有当政治和艺术紧密结合，才能产生伟大的、富有教育意义的作品，看了苏联漫画，我们深深地体会到这一点。这一点也正是特别值得我们学习的。
