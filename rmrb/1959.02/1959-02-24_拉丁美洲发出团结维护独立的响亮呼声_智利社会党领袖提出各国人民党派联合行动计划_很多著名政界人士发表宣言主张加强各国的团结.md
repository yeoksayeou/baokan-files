Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: Santiago dispatch: Chilean Socialist leader Allende recently, at a meeting with leaders of the Venezuelan Democratic Action Party, put forward a plan for joint action by people's parties of Latin American countries, aimed at opposing colonialism and safeguarding national interests. The plan emphasizes cooperation among Latin American countries, taking joint action against colonialism and dictatorship, while economically and politically safeguarding national independence. It is reported that the above plan has received widespread attention from Latin American democrats.

The joint action plan of the people's parties of Latin American countries includes eighteen points. It focuses on eliminating colonialism in Latin America, demanding international recognition of the complete independence of all existing colonies in Latin America, and expressing firm support for the burgeoning national independence movements in Asia and Africa. The plan proposes to greatly reduce military spending and all war-related expenses. The main measures in the political sphere are to establish a standing committee to strive for the establishment of power in Latin American countries on a legal and majority support basis, and to solve some of the most basic problems in establishing a democratic national system. In the economic sphere, it advocates convening a congress of political leaders and technical personnel from various people's parties to determine a common economic policy to protect raw materials and guarantee national independence.

The plan also puts forward some proposals regarding cultural education, workers' rights, and social life in Latin American countries. Such as guaranteeing the basic rights of workers, establishing a Latin American news agency, and implementing educational guidelines aimed at cultivating the collective social and democratic consciousness of the Latin American people.

Xinhua News Agency, Caracas dispatch: Some well-known politicians and democrats in Latin America recently issued declarations advocating strengthening unity among Latin American countries in order to establish "effective and fair relations" with the United States.

The declaration was issued on the 15th in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. According to reports, those who signed the declaration included former President of Costa Rica, José Figueres; Chairman of the Chilean Popular Action Front, Salvador Allende; Chairman of the Quito Cultural Committee of Ecuador, Benjamín Carrión; leader of the Peruvian People's Party, Ramiro Priale; and publisher of the Colombian "El Tiempo" newspaper, Roberto García Peña, among others.

The declaration advocates the implementation of "Latin American integration unity" and the establishment of a "common market." The declaration points out that "the basis of the above proposals is the close ties of the peoples of various countries, which should be maintained through democratic parties, workers' and peasants' organizations, as well as student and cultural groups." The declaration went on to say, "We believe that a united, free, and strong Latin America can establish and maintain effective and fair relations with the United States, based on democratic Pan-Americanism and fair and reasonable international economic relations."

Xinhua News Agency, Santiago dispatch: Trade union leaders from various Latin American countries recently issued a call in Santiago, demanding that Latin American trade unions unite to form a unified Latin American labor union. This means that the labor movement in Latin America will move towards a new stage in the future.

According to a report by the Chilean "Ultima Hora" on the 17th, these trade union leaders came to attend the third national conference of the Unified Workers' Union of Chile, which opened on the 13th. Among them were Antonio Moreno, Secretary of the Latin American Labor Alliance, as well as trade union representatives from Venezuela, Uruguay, Mexico and other countries. These trade union leaders exchanged information and opinions on the activities of workers in Latin American countries, and on the 16th, they agreed in principle that the Unified Workers' Union of Chile should send a proposal to all central trade unions in Latin America: to exchange views and take possible joint actions on special issues such as regional markets and the struggle against tyranny; and to hold a trade union conference with representatives from all over Latin America in the coming months to discuss the establishment of a unified Latin American labor union with its headquarters possibly located in Santiago, Chile.

    这个拉丁美洲各人民党派联合行动计划包括十八点。其中着重提出了要在拉丁美洲消灭殖民主义，要求国际上承认拉丁美洲现有的所有殖民地完全独立，并且表示要坚决支持在亚洲和非洲蓬勃发展的民族独立运动。这个计划提出要大大削减军费和一切战争性质的费用。在政治方面的主要措施，是建立一个常设委员会，从事争取拉丁美洲各国的政权在合法和多数支持的基础上产生，并且解决在建立民主国家制度方面的最起码的一些问题。在经济方面，主张召开一个各人民党派的政治领袖和技术人员的代表大会，来确定一个保护原料和保证民族独立的共同的经济政策。
