Seeking Knowledge for Greater Agricultural Bumper Harvests
450,000 People Visit the National Agricultural Exhibition

    According to Xinhua News Agency, more than twenty provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country have sent visiting delegations to Beijing to visit the National Agricultural Exhibition. The members of the visiting delegations are mostly cadres from the four levels of Party organizations and governments: province, prefecture, county, and commune.

    The National Agricultural Exhibition has organized many report meetings and symposiums on the experience of high-yield crop production for the visiting delegations, and also screened films about agricultural science and technology for the representatives. Many representatives visited diligently during the day, held discussions in the evening, and sorted out notes late into the night. Through intensive visits and learning, the representatives realized that in order to strive for a great leap forward in agricultural production, it is necessary to comprehensively implement the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. Lan Yuanyuan, secretary of the Victory People's Commune Party Committee in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, carefully studied the experience of high-yield rice production through large-scale close planting in the Xiaogan Prefecture in the High-Yield Measures Hall. He found that the reason why there had been no increase in production in his area in the past was that various measures such as water and fertilizer had not kept up after close planting. Therefore, he had a further understanding and experience of the intrinsic connection of the "Eight-Point Charter." The experience of drawing water up the mountains in Wushan County, Gansu Province, greatly inspired the representatives of Guangdong Province. The representatives realized that the current implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter" must first overcome the fertilizer hurdle. Therefore, they were particularly careful when visiting the fertilizer room.

    Since the opening of the exhibition a month ago, new exhibits have been continuously sent from various places, enriching the content of the exhibition. During this period, more than 454,000 people visited. Foreign envoys and embassy staff in China, as well as many international friends visiting our country, also visited the exhibition.

    为农业更大丰产取经
    四十五万人参观全国农业展览会
    据新华社讯　全国已有二十多个省、市、自治区派出参观团到北京参观全国农业展览会。参观团的成员绝大部分是省、专区、县、社四级党组织和政府的干部。
    全国农业展览会为参观团代表们组织了很多次各种农作物丰产经验的报告会和座谈会，还为代表们放映了有关农业科学技术的电影。很多代表白天认真参观，晚上进行座谈，深夜整理笔记。通过紧张的参观和学习，代表们认识到：要争取农业生产的大跃进，必须全面地执行农业“八字宪法”。四川省内江县胜利人民公社党委书记兰源渊，在增产措施馆仔细研究了孝感专区大面积密植水稻丰产的经验，发现他们那里过去没有增产，是因为密植后水、肥等各种措施没有跟上，因此，对“八字宪法”的内在联系有了进一步的认识和体会。甘肃武山县引水上山的经验介绍，对广东省的代表启发很大。代表们认识到当前贯彻“八字宪法”首先要闯过肥料关。所以参观肥料室时就特别仔细。
    展览会开幕一月来，各地源源不断地送来新的展品，丰富了展出内容。在这个时期里，有四十五万四千多人参观。到展览会参观的，还有各国驻华使节和大使馆的工作人员，许多来我国访问的国际友人。
