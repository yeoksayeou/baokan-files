Natural Power Should Serve Production
By People's Daily Commentator

1959 is a year of even greater leaps forward in China's industry and agriculture. The people's communes must promote industry and agriculture simultaneously, and develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in an all-round way. The situation of tight labor will be even more serious. Therefore, further improving labor productivity to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor is of paramount importance to ensuring an even greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1959. The fundamental measure to improve labor productivity is to realize agricultural mechanization and electrification. However, at present, China has very few tractors, diesel engines, and other power machinery, and they cannot be produced and supplied in large quantities in the short term. Therefore, the fundamental way to solve the current labor shortage must rely on tool reform to realize agricultural semi-mechanization. Improving the structure of the tools themselves to make them more rational and scientific can increase labor efficiency several times or even dozens of times. However, any tool needs power to drive it. Therefore, while reforming tools, vigorously developing various natural power sources to replace human power to directly drive various operating tools is not only an important measure to solve the shortage of labor and reduce labor intensity, but also an important step for China to move from improved agricultural tools to semi-mechanization. At the same time, it will also prepare reliable energy resources for China to realize agricultural mechanization and electrification.

Chinese farmers have long had experience in using hydropower and wind power to serve agricultural production. After liberation, especially during the tool reform movement in 1958, there was even greater development. Many regions have achieved great results in using wind and water power to serve agricultural production. In Tao'an County, Jilin Province, a total of 747 windmills of various types were promoted in the first half of 1958, replacing more than 2,000 horsepower, irrigating more than 16,000 mu of land throughout the year. In Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, 4,300 windmills were promoted, irrigating more than 300,000 mu of rice fields, saving more than 4.3 million workdays. In Shuanggou Township, Jiangdu County, Jiangsu Province, a hydropower station was built on the canal, generating 10 horsepower. Two people manage it, and it can grind 1,300 to 2,200 jin of flour every day, saving more than 50 labor workdays. Wugang County, Hunan Province, has now built more than 180 hydropower stations, all equipped with wooden water turbines, as well as 81 rice milling machines, 45 sweet potato shredders, and 53 flour milling machines. Although the excavation and utilization of biogas is a recent event, areas such as Fuyang in Anhui Province, Heshan in Guangdong Province, and Weixian in Hebei Province have accumulated complete sets of experience, providing us with effective methods for large-scale promotion and utilization of biogas. Many places are currently promoting this experience.

China's natural energy is extremely rich. In terms of hydropower resources, China's southern and northern rivers run vertically and horizontally, and there are many lakes and abundant coastal tides. In addition, in recent years, large-scale water conservancy construction has been carried out, and a large number of culverts, dams, and reservoirs have been built. In terms of wind power, in many regions of the country, there are winds of level three or above for most seasons of the year, and the wind power is even greater in coastal, lakeside, and riverine areas. As for biogas, it exists everywhere, regardless of the region. Therefore, wind power, hydropower, and biogas can all be utilized greatly. The problem now is to act quickly, make specific plans based on local conditions according to the principle of using wind when there is wind, water when there is water, and gas (biogas, natural gas) when there is gas, and launch a movement to utilize natural power centered on tool reform. In the short term, use wind and water power to replace a large amount of human and animal labor, so that all fixed processing operations such as water lifting, threshing, flour milling, rice milling, slicing, straw cutting, and sawing can use natural power as much as possible. In areas with conditions, we should also vigorously use energy to generate electricity. China has built many small hydropower stations in recent years. Its advantage is that kinetic energy is easy to transport and electrical energy is convenient to use. Areas with conditions should vigorously develop it. Areas where conditions are not yet available can take a "two-step" approach, first building hydropower stations and then building hydroelectric power stations.

According to China's current specific situation, when manufacturing and utilizing natural power tools and machinery, we should mainly use indigenous methods, and choose those that are efficient, of good quality, simple to manufacture, and easy to obtain materials locally for manufacturing. The types of windmills and water turbines created by the masses in various places are diverse. They should be carefully selected, specifications should be set, and quality should be guaranteed. Existing wind or water power tools should also be improved to further play a role. Jiangsu Province estimates that slightly improving the 150,000 windmills in the province can generate more than one million horsepower. Calculating one horsepower equivalent to five laborers, it can save five million laborers every day. This is a remarkable event.

Utilizing natural power is a major measure to carry out tool reform in a more, faster, better and more economical way. It is also a concrete preparation for China to realize agricultural mechanization and electrification, and has great political and economic significance. Natural power is inexhaustible and the cheapest. Not only at present, but even in the future when various power machines can be supplied in large quantities, wind power, hydropower, and biogas are still indispensable power resources. All localities should actively explore and utilize them in all aspects, achieve results in the short term, and make hydropower, wind power, and biogas widely used in rural areas.

The fundamental guarantee for completing the above tasks is to strengthen Party leadership and implement the mass line. While vigorously carrying out tool reform, Party organizations at all levels must firmly grasp the exploration and utilization of natural power, seek labor from wind power and hydropower, and make natural power benefit mankind.

    要自然动力为生产服务 
    本报评论员
    1959年是我国工业农业更大跃进的一年，人民公社的工农业要同时并举，农林牧副渔要全面发展，劳动力紧张情况就更严重。因之，进一步提高劳动生产率解决劳力不足的困难，对保证1959年工农业生产更大跃进，具有非常重要的作用。提高劳动生产率的根本措施是实现农业机械化、电气化。但是，现在我国拖拉机、柴油机等动力机械还很少，而且短期内还不能大量生产供应，因此当前解决劳动力不足的根本办法，必须依靠工具改革，实现农业半机械化。改进工具本身结构，使它更合理更科学，可以几倍、十几倍地提高劳动效率；但是，任何工具都需要有动力来带动。因此在改革工具的同时，大搞各种自然动力能源，用它代替人力来直接带动各种作业工具，不仅是解决劳动力不足、减轻劳动强度的一个重要措施，也是我国由改良农具进入半机械化的一个重要步骤。同时也将为我国实现农业机械化电气化，准备下可靠的能力资源。
    对自然动力的利用，我国农民在很早以前，就有利用水力风力为农业生产服务的经验。解放以后，特别在1958年工具改革运动中，更有了很大的发展。不少地区利用风力和水力为农业生产服务取得的成绩很大。吉林洮安县1958年半年共推广各种风车七百四十七部，代替二千多匹马力，全年共灌溉一万六千多亩土地。浙江省嘉兴县推广风车四千三百部，灌溉稻田三十余万亩，节省四百三十余万工。江苏省江都县双沟乡，在渠道上建立一个水力站，发出十马力动力，两人管理，每天能磨面一千三百斤到二千二百斤，节省五十多个劳动工日。湖南武岗县现已建成水力站一百八十余处，全部安装上木制水轮机，并装有碾米机八十一台，红薯切丝机四十五台，磨粉机五十三部。发掘和利用沼气虽是最近的事，但由于安徽省阜阳、广东省鹤山、河北省威县等地区积累了成套的经验，给我们大量推广利用沼气提供了有效的办法。目前不少地方已推广这一经验。
    我国自然能源是极为丰富的。就水力资源说，我国南方北方江河纵横，湖泊众多，沿海潮汐多，加以几年来大搞水利建设，兴修了大量涵闸、塘坝、水库。在风力方面，全国不少地区，常年多数季节有三级以上风力，沿海滨湖靠江河的地区，风力还要大些。至于沼气，不分什么地区到处都有。因此不论是风力、水力和沼气都大可利用。现在的问题是要迅速行动，根据有风用风、有水用水、有气（沼气、天然气）用气的原则，因地制宜地作出具体规划，开展一个以工具改革为中心的利用自然动力的运动，在短期内利用风力和水力代替大量人、畜力劳动，使一切固定加工作业如提水、脱粒、磨粉、碾米、切片、铡草、锯木等，尽量利用自然动力；在有条件地区，还应大力利用能源发电。我国近几年来已建成许多小型水电站，它的好处是动能便于运输、电能使用方便。有条件地区应大力发展，条件暂时不具备的地区，可以分“两步走”，先建水力站，后建水电站。
    根据我国当前的具体情况，在制造利用自然动力的工具和机械时，应以土法为主，选择那些效率高，质量好，制造简单，便于就地取材的进行制造。现在各地群众创造的风车和水轮机的类型是多种多样的，应加以精选，定出规格，保证质量；现有的风力或水力工具也要注意改进，进一步发挥作用。江苏省估算，全省十五万部风车只要略加改进，就能发出一百万以上的马力，以一马力抵五个劳力计算，每天可节省五百万个劳动力。这是一件了不起的大事。
    利用自然动力是多快好省开展工具改革的一项重大措施，也是我国实现农业机械化电气化的一项具体准备工作，有很大的政治经济意义。自然动力是取之不尽用之不竭的，最便宜的，不仅在目前，就是在将来在各种动力机械可以大量供应的情况下，风力、水力和沼气等仍是不可忽视的动力资源。各地应积极的从各方面发掘利用，在短期内做出成绩，使水力、风力、沼气在农村中普遍利用起来。
    完成以上任务的根本保证，是加强党的领导和贯彻群众路线。各级党组织在大搞工具改革的同时，要抓紧自然动力的发掘和利用，向风力、水力要工，要自然动力为人类造福。
