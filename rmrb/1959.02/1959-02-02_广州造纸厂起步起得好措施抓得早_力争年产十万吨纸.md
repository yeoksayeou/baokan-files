Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 31st: Guangzhou Paper Mill, China's largest newsprint factory, has already completed its January state production plan ahead of schedule on the 27th. All employees are doing everything possible to increase the production capacity of existing equipment to ensure the realization of the Great Leap Forward plan to break through 100,000 tons of paper production this year.

The designed capacity of the Guangzhou Paper Mill is 50,000 tons of newsprint per year. During the Great Leap Forward last year, the employees had great enthusiasm and, despite labor shortages and other circumstances, overfulfilled the leap forward plan of producing 65,000 tons of paper. Indicators such as quality and total output value were also fully completed.

Since New Year's Day this year, they have mustered even greater enthusiasm than last year, determined to further increase the capacity of existing equipment and, while ensuring quality, increase paper production by 35,000 to 40,000 tons compared to last year, breaking through 100,000 tons.

During January, the workers in each workshop launched a vigorous technical revolution movement. The production capacity of each paper machine in the No. 1 paper-making workshop was designed to be 25 tons per day. Last year, it had been increased to 48 tons. The workers are determined to increase it by another 20% this year and have researched more than 40 measures. For example, to increase the production capacity of the paper machine, the speed must first be increased, but the motor's capacity cannot be further increased. So, the workers painstakingly studied and replaced the driven pulley of the motor's main shaft with a smaller one, speeding up the motor's rotation. Subsequently, they used waste materials and substitutes to manufacture some auxiliary equipment, trying to increase the paper pulp drying capacity, comprehensively ensuring the improvement of the paper machine's production capacity and the quality of the paper.

    广州造纸厂起步起得好措施抓得早
    力争年产十万吨纸
    新华社广州31日电　我国最大的新闻纸厂——广州造纸厂已经提前在27日完成了1月份的国家生产计划。全厂职工正在千方百计提高现有设备的生产能力，保证实现今年纸张产量突破十万吨的大跃进计划。
    广州造纸厂的设计能力是年产五万吨新闻纸。去年大跃进中，职工们干劲一直很大，在劳动力紧张等情况下，超额完成了生产纸张六万五千吨的跃进计划，质量、总产值等方面的指标也都完满地完成。
    今年元旦以来，他们鼓起比去年更大的劲头，决心再提高现有设备的能力，在保证质量的原则下，比去年增产纸张三万五千吨到四万吨，突破十万吨。
    各个车间的职工，在1月份内开展了轰轰烈烈的技术革命运动。第一抄纸车间的抄纸机，每台的生产能力按设计是日产二十五吨，去年已提高到四十八吨，职工们决心今年再提高20％，并且研究出四十多项措施。如提高抄纸机的生产能力，首先要提高车速，但马达的能力不能再发挥，工人们就苦心钻研，把马达的总轴被动皮带轮换成小的，加快了马达的转动。随后，他们又利用废料和代用材料，制造了一些辅助设备，想法增加了纸浆干燥能力，全面保证了抄纸机生产能力的提高和纸张的质量。
