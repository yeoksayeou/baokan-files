Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 31st - TASS reports: TASS communique: As announced at the beginning of last year, based on the decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on December 21, 1957, the Soviet government, proceeding from the interests of peace and easing international tensions, adopted a resolution on the unilateral reduction of the Soviet armed forces. The resolution stipulated that in addition to the 1.84 million already reduced in 1955-1956, a further 300,000 would be cut.

    By January 1, 1959, all measures stipulated by the government according to this resolution had been fully implemented. The Soviet armed forces had been reduced by 300,000 by January 1, 1959. The reduced armed forces were mainly troops, corps, and military organs stationed within the Soviet Union. In addition, many troops and corps have been withdrawn from the following areas to the Soviet Union and have been demobilized: more than 41,000 people withdrawn from the German Democratic Republic, and more than 17,000 people withdrawn from the Hungarian People's Republic.

    Retired army and navy personnel have been assigned to return to their hometowns for production.

    The funds saved by this reduction in armed forces are used to develop the national economy and further improve the material and cultural living conditions of the Soviet people.

    In announcing that the Soviet Union's planned reduction of 300,000 armed forces has been fully completed, the Soviet government expressed its belief that this important action by the Soviet Union will help ease international tensions and establish an atmosphere of trust among countries. The reduction of armed forces implemented by the Soviet Union once again convincingly demonstrates the well-known fact that the Soviet Union consistently and steadfastly implements the Leninist policy of international peace and friendship.

    Soviet leaders hope that the Soviet Union's unilateral reduction of armed forces and armaments will serve as an example to other countries, especially members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, prompting them to also take concrete and practical measures to stop the dangerous arms race and ease international tensions.

    说到做到
    苏联完成裁军三十万
    新华社31日讯　塔斯社莫斯科30日电：塔斯社公报：去年年初曾经宣布，根据苏联最高苏维埃1957年12月21日的决定，苏联政府从和平和缓和国际紧张局势的利益出发，通过了苏联单方面裁减武装部队的决议，决议规定除1955—1956年已经裁减了一百八十四万人以外，再裁减三十万人。
    到1959年1月1日为止，政府根据这个决议所规定的一切措施都已全部实现，苏联的武装部队到1959年1月1日已经裁减了三十万人。裁减的武装部队基本上是驻在苏联境内的军队、兵团和军事机关。此外，许多军队和兵团已从下列地区撤回苏联，并且已经复员：从德意志民主共和国撤回四万一千人以上，从匈牙利人民共和国撤回一万七千人以上。
    陆海军退职人员已经安排回乡生产。
    这次裁减武装部队所节省下来的资金用于发展国民经济和进一步改善苏联人民物质和文化生活条件。
    在宣布苏联预定的裁减武装部队三十万人已经全部完成时，苏联政府表示相信，苏联这一重要行动有助于缓和国际紧张局势和建立各国间信任的气氛。苏联所实行的裁减武装部队再一次令人信服地表明了这样一个众人皆知的事实：苏联一贯坚定不移地执行国际和平和友谊的列宁主义政策。
    苏联领导人士希望，苏联单方面裁减武装部队和军备的做法将成为其他国家，特别是北大西洋公约组织成员国的榜样，促使它们也采取具体的实际措施来停止危险的军备竞赛，并缓和国际紧张局势。
