    The Maghreb and the Tangier Conference
    Question: On the 23rd, your newspaper published an article by Comrade Ali Yata, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Moroccan Communist Party, on the current tasks of the Moroccan people, which is very helpful for us to understand the current struggle of the Moroccan people. The article mentioned that the people of the Arab Maghreb are demanding unification. What does Arab Maghreb mean? And what was the Tangier Conference of April 1958 about?
    Beijing Reader: Sha Chongguang
    Answer: "Maghreb" in Arabic means "Western countries." From the Middle Ages until today, "Maghreb" has referred to the collective name of the three countries of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. For a long historical period, the three countries of North Africa were one country, namely "Maghreb." Moroccans today still call their country "Maghreb al-Aqsa," meaning "the farthest western country," and the Moroccan parliament is also called the "Maghreb Parliament."
    In 682 AD, the Arabs reached North Africa from east to west, and after a period of time, they and the local Berbers together formed a country called "Maghreb." In the 14th century, with the invasion of the Turks, "Maghreb" was gradually divided. By the end of the 18th century, only Morocco remained independent. By the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, the three countries of North Africa, that is, the original "Maghreb" countries, successively became colonies under the invasion of imperialist countries.
    Today, among the three countries of North Africa, Morocco and Tunisia have achieved independence, but the remnants of colonialism within the country remain to be eliminated. Algeria is continuing its armed struggle against the French colonialists. Because these three countries belong to the same cultural system, speak a common language, experience the same history, and the people of the three countries have the common goal of opposing imperialism, for a long time, these three countries have regarded the realization of the unification of the three North African countries as a reliable way to obtain complete liberation from imperialist rule and build a better future. It was with this common aspiration that in April 1958, the leaders of the main political organizations of the three North African countries—the Istiqlal Party of Morocco, the Neo Destour Party of Tunisia, and the National Liberation Front of Algeria—held a conference in Tangier. The Tangier Conference discussed the war for independence in Algeria, the elimination of the remnants of colonial rule in North African countries, and the unification of Arab North Africa. The conference passed a resolution to establish a "North African Consultative Assembly" as a transitional stage to a "North African Federation." After the meeting, a permanent secretariat was established in accordance with the resolution to ensure the implementation of the resolution. Since April of last year, the "Maghreb" permanent secretariat has held meetings to study issues related to North Africa, but the main issues in the conference resolutions remain to be resolved.

### 马格里布和丹吉尔会议

    马格里布和丹吉尔会议
    问：23日你报刊登了摩洛哥共产党中央委员会第一书记阿里·亚塔同志关于摩洛哥人民当前任务的文章，对我们了解摩洛哥人民当前的斗争很有帮助。文内提到了阿拉伯马格里布的人民要求实现统一，阿拉伯马格里布是什么意思？1958年4月丹吉尔会议又是怎样的？
    北京读者　沙重光
    答：“马格里布”在阿拉伯语中的意思是“西方的国家”，从中世纪直到今天，“马格里布”都是指摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚和突尼斯三国的总称。在很长一段历史时期内，北非三国是一个国家，即“马格里布”。摩洛哥人今天仍称自己的国家为“马格里布—埃尔—阿克萨”，即“最西方的国家”，摩洛哥的议会也称为“马格里布议会”。
    公元682年，阿拉伯人由东向西到达北非，经过一个时期就和当地的伯尔伯人共同构成了一个国家“马格里布”。十四世纪时，随着土耳其人的入侵，“马格里布”逐渐被分割，到十八世纪末叶时，就只剩下了摩洛哥一地保持着独立。而到十九世纪末和二十世纪初，北非三国，即原来的“马格里布”国家，先后在帝国主义国家侵略下成了殖民地。
    今天北非三国中，摩洛哥和突尼斯虽已取得独立，但国内的殖民主义残余有待清除；阿尔及利亚则正继续同法国殖民者进行武装斗争。这三个国家由于属于同一文化体系，讲着共同的语言，经历着同样的历史，而且三国人民有着反对帝国主义的共同的目标；所以，长期以来，这三个国家把实现北非三国的统一视为是从帝国主义统治下获得彻底解放、建设美好未来的可靠办法。正是本着这种共同的愿望，1958年4月，北非三国的主要政治组织——摩洛哥的独立党、突尼斯的新宪政党和阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的领袖们在丹吉尔举行了会议。丹吉尔会议讨论了阿尔及利亚争取独立的战争问题、消除北非各国的殖民统治残余问题以及阿拉伯北非的统一问题。会议通过决议成立“北非谘询议会”作为“北非联邦”的过渡阶段。会后，根据决议成立了常设秘书处来保证决议的执行。自去年4月以来，“马格里布”常设秘书处曾举行过会议来研究有关北非问题，但是会议决议中的主要问题还有待解决。
