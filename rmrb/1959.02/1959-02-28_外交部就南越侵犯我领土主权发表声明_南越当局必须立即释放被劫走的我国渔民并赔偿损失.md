Xinhua News Agency, February 27th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement regarding the South Vietnamese authorities' violation of China's territorial sovereignty and abduction of Chinese fishermen.

February 27, 1959

According to reports from China's coastal defense forces, on February 22, 1959, the South Vietnamese Navy illegally intruded into Chenhang Island in China's Xisha Islands, abducting 82 of our fishermen, seizing five of our fishing boats, and other property. In response, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China is authorized to issue the following statement:

The Xisha Islands are Chinese territory. The government of the People's Republic of China made solemn declarations on August 15, 1951, and May 29, 1956, regarding this matter. Now, the South Vietnamese Navy has openly violated China's territorial sovereignty, abducting our fishermen and fishing boats, which has aroused great indignation among the Chinese people.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China solemnly declares that the South Vietnamese authorities must immediately release all the abducted Chinese fishermen, return all the seized fishing boats and other property, compensate for the losses of the abducted fishermen, and guarantee that similar illegal incidents will not occur in the future. Otherwise, the South Vietnamese authorities must bear all the consequences arising therefrom.

Xinhua News Agency, February 27th: A South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem gunboat that illegally intruded into China's Xisha Islands sailed to Chenhang Island (also known as Dengqing Island) in the Xisha Islands on the morning of February 22 and forcibly seized 82 Chinese fishermen and five fishing boats, as well as many other belongings.

On the night of February 20, a South Vietnamese Navy gunboat, HQ225, sailed to the vicinity of Beidao for reconnaissance activities. On the 21st, the gunboat intercepted our fishing boats south of Xishazhou and forced an elderly fisherman onto their gunboat for questioning, attempting to extract information about the situation of the various islands of Xisha. On the morning of the 22nd, the gunboat sailed from the direction of Coral Island to Chenhang Island, dispatched more than ten armed personnel to board our fishing boats and land on Chenhang Island, rudely tearing down our national flag on the fishing boats and on the island, and forcibly abducted 82 of our fishermen, five fishing boats, and other property.

At the same time, a South Vietnamese aircraft also carried out reconnaissance activities over the Xisha Islands.

    新华社27日讯　中华人民共和国外交部就南越当局侵犯我国领土主权劫走我国渔民一事发表声明。　一九五九年二月二十七日
    根据我国海防部队报告，1959年2月22日，南越海军非法侵入我国西沙群岛中的琛航岛，劫走我渔民八十二人，掠走我渔船五只和其他财物。对此，中华人民共和国外交部受权发表声明如下：
    西沙群岛是中国的领土。中华人民共和国政府在1951年8月15日和1956年5月29日对此曾经作过庄严的声明。现在，南越海军竟公然侵犯我国领土主权，劫走我国渔民和渔船，这引起了中国人民的极大愤慨。
    中华人民共和国外交部严正声明，南越当局必须立即全部释放被劫走的中国渔民，交还被掠走的所有渔船和其他财物，赔偿被劫走渔民的损失，并且保证今后不再发生类此的非法事件。否则，南越当局必须承担由此而产生的一切后果。
    新华社27日讯　非法侵入我西沙群岛的南越吴庭艳炮艇一艘2月22日上午开至西沙群岛的琛航岛（又名灯擎岛）使用武力掠走我国渔民八十二人和渔船五艘，还劫走许多财物。
    2月20日夜，一艘南越海军炮艇HQ225号开至北岛一带进行侦察活动。21日该炮艇又在西沙洲以南拦截我渔船，并迫令我一老年渔民上他们的炮艇多般盘问，企图刺探我西沙各岛的情况。22日上午，该炮艇又从珊瑚岛方向开至琛航岛，派出十余名武装人员先登上我渔船后又在琛航岛登陆，无礼撕毁渔船上和岛上的我国国旗，并且使用武力将我渔民八十二人、渔船五艘和其他财物劫走。
    与此同时，南越飞机一架也在西沙群岛上空来回侦察。
