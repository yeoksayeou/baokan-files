Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, February 3rd. Known for its exquisite and diverse products, the Lüda Glass Products Factory is actively taking measures to increase the production of glass products.

According to the leap forward plan formulated by the Lüda Glass Products Factory, the output of thermos bottles, glassware, glass instruments, and various types of bottles will increase sixfold compared to last year, and twenty-eight new products such as gemstone glass and glass fiber will be trial-produced. In order to complete this leap forward plan, all factory workers have launched a mass technical revolution movement from the beginning of this year. Workers have manufactured many simple machines to replace manual operations, greatly improving labor productivity. The recently manufactured cup grinding machine and cup blowing machine have increased production efficiency by 1.5 to 3 times respectively. They also built nine tank furnaces themselves to expand equipment.

    试制二十八种新产品
    旅大玻璃厂定出奋斗目标
    据新华社旅大3日电　以产品精美多样著称的旅大玻璃制品厂，正在积极采取措施增产玻璃制品。
    按照旅大玻璃制品厂制定的跃进计划，今年暖水瓶、玻璃器皿、玻璃器材以及各种瓶类产品的产量将比去年提高六倍，并且要试制宝石玻璃、玻璃纤维等二十八种新产品。为了完成这个跃进计划，全厂职工从今年一开头就开展了群众性的技术革命运动。职工们制造了许多简易的机器来代替手工操作，大大提高了劳动生产率。最近制成的磨杯机和吹杯机，就将生产效率分别提高了一倍半到三倍。他们还自己动手修建了九座池窑，扩充了设备。
