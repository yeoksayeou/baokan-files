Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The Ministry of Agriculture issued an emergency notice on the 16th, requiring all regions to quickly repair and replenish small farm tools to welcome the upcoming spring plowing and planting.

The notice stated that in order to adapt to the needs of a greater leap forward in agriculture, repairing and replenishing small farm tools is a current urgent task. It is an important link in promoting the manure accumulation campaign, strengthening wheat field management, and preparing for spring plowing. The farm tools needed for spring plowing and planting (including various drainage and irrigation tools) must be effectively prepared before the season arrives, so as not to miss the farming season. To this end, the notice requires:

I. Every people's commune must, with the production team as the unit, conduct a comprehensive inspection of existing farm tools to find out how many can still be used and how many are damaged and need to be repaired. According to needs, make a plan for repairing and adding small farm tools.

II. All counties and communes must immediately organize blacksmiths and carpenters, assign tasks, and immediately start repairing and manufacturing farm tools, and pay attention to quality to ensure that they are easy to use and durable. The local iron, local steel, and miscellaneous wood needed for repairing and adding small farm tools should be obtained locally, and the commune should raise funds by itself. If the commune really has no way, the county will adjust and solve the problem.

III. Agricultural machinery and drainage and irrigation machinery transferred to other production fronts should also be cleaned up in a timely manner to ensure that they return to the team before the use season arrives.

IV. In the warehouses of commercial departments' waste product recycling stations, there are still some usable or repairable farm tools. These should be cleaned up and repaired, and then sold to the communes. They cannot be treated as waste products.

V. Resolutely strengthen the management of farm tools and establish and improve the farm tool management and use system. Each people's commune, production brigade, and production team should have a dedicated person in charge of the management of farm tools, and should check and prepare the farm tools needed for this season in advance according to different farming seasons, and make it a regular system.

    准备小农具迎接春耕春种
    新华社17日讯　农业部16日发出紧急通知，要求各地迅速整修增补小农具，迎接即将到来的春耕春种。
    通知说，为了适应农业更大跃进的需要，修理和添补小农具是当前的急务；是推动积肥运动、加强麦田管理和做好春耕准备的一个重要环节。春耕春种所需要的农具（连同各种排灌提水工具在内），必须在季节到来以前切实准备好，以免违误农时。为此，通知要求：
    一、每一个人民公社，都要以生产队为单位，对现有的农具做一番全面的检查，弄清有多少还能使用，有多少坏了需要修理，根据需要，做出整修和添制小农具的计划。
    二、各县、各社都要立即把铁匠、木匠组织起来，分配任务，立即开始修理制造农具，并且注意质量，保证好用耐用。修理添制小农具，所需要的土铁、土钢和杂木料应该就地取材，由公社自筹，公社实在无办法的，由县调剂解决。
    三、转移到其他生产战线上去的农机具和排灌机械，也应该及时清理，保证在使用季节到来以前归队。
    四、商业部门废品收购站的仓库中，还有些能用的或者修理以后仍然能用的农具，应该加以清理和整修，再出售给公社，不能当作废品处理。
    五、切实加强对农具的保管工作，建立和健全农具保管、使用制度。各人民公社、生产大队和生产队都应该有专人经常负责农具的保管工作，而且应该按不同的农事季节，事前检查准备好这个季节所需要的农具，并使它成为一种经常制度。
