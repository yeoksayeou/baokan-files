Agronomist Goes to the Countryside to Collect Treasures
——Notes on Professor Sun Qu’s Five Months of Learning in the Countryside
By our reporter Zhu Bin

In early September of last year, among the group of teachers and students from Beijing Agricultural University who were sent to the Xionghuo People's Commune in Hongtong County, Shanxi Province, was Professor Sun Qu. He wore a blue khaki uniform and a round hat with a brim, looking much like a rural cadre familiar to the peasants. In addition to giving the commune members systematic lectures on philosophy, and occasionally on agronomy and agricultural soil science, he spent more time each day working alongside the commune members. He pushed a cart to deliver manure to the fields, he cut corn and millet, and he deep-plowed the land. During breaks, he sat with the commune members at the edge of the fields, chatting and asking them about their various farming experiences. Before going to bed each night, he would record these learned experiences, bit by bit, in his notebook. Over the past five months, he has filled five notebooks with the experiences he has collected. He is also often invited to attend production activist meetings at the county and provincial levels, and to discuss various farming experiences with labor models from the county and province, and to visit and observe their homes. Based on these materials, Sun Qu has already written papers on the high-yield experiences of wheat, sweet potatoes, and corn, and is also writing a paper on the high-yield experiences of cotton. In the completed papers, he elaborated on the methods of deep plowing, close planting, fertilization, and irrigation according to various conditions.

Sun Qu began his research and teaching work in agricultural soil science in 1938. However, the education he had received and the established academic path he had followed kept him confined to books. Two years ago, when farmers gained experience in increasing production through deep plowing of two or three feet, Sun Qu was still conducting research experiments on deep plowing of one foot and two inches. His students, after going to the countryside, could not solve many practical problems. During the "double-anti" campaign last year, he urgently requested to connect with reality. In August of last year, after the Party Committee of Beijing Agricultural University conveyed the Party Central Committee's decision on sending agricultural and forestry colleges to the countryside, Sun Qu regarded this decision as a great opportunity for him personally to end the separation of theory from practice and to turn to integrating theory with practice.

As soon as Sun Qu arrived in the countryside, he was attracted by the rich experiences there. Watering wheat fields in winter is called "irrigating winter water" by the farmers. When to irrigate and how much to irrigate? Not only is it not found in books, Sun Qu had not learned about this in the laboratory either. But the farmers irrigate when it is "freezing and thawing," that is, when the ice and snow melt during the day, and they irrigate as much water as the ground can absorb before it freezes at night, so as to avoid the water freezing on the ground and damaging the wheat seedlings. How to prevent cotton boll shedding? This is also a major issue in cotton planting. When Sun Qu went to the Dongfeng People's Commune in Anyi County, Shanxi Province, he saw that the farmer Guo Zhenxi had solved this problem through fertilization. Guo Zhenxi applies different fertilizers according to the cotton's growth period, first applying phosphate fertilizer, and then applying nitrogen fertilizer when the cotton flowers and sets bolls. Sun Qu felt that this had very important scientific reasoning: applying phosphate fertilizer first and not applying nitrogen fertilizer can make the roots grow well and avoid excessive vegetative growth, which hinders flowering and boll setting. Applying nitrogen fertilizer during boll setting can promote cotton boll growth, making the cotton bolls grow more and larger, which can avoid boll shedding. In the Xionghuo People's Commune where Sun Qu was located, eight hundred mu of land yielded 802 jin of wheat per mu, and in another nearby commune, more than 30,000 jin of sweet potatoes grew on one mu of land... These further broadened Sun Qu's horizons. Sun Qu began to feel that some agronomists' view that farmers' high yields relied on enthusiasm and had no scientific basis was not only a misunderstanding but also unfounded. The countryside is the best classroom and the best research room, and the commune members are their best teachers.

The commune members' rich farming experience is scattered in everyone's minds. In order to learn from them, Sun Qu became an apprentice to the commune members, worked with them, and learned by asking questions until he got to the bottom of them. Once, he saw commune members sowing wheat seeds on the river beach without plowing. This was contrary to normal practice. Sun Qu asked the commune members to talk about the reason for doing so. The commune member told him that the river beach land was silt, and the soil was sticky and wet. Once plowed, the soil would clump together, and once the clumps dried, crops would not grow. The commune member also grabbed a handful of soil, rubbed it between his fingers, and said: The slippery part is the soil, and the astringent part is the sand. When putting silt, you also have to look at the soil conditions. If it is slippery, then put it; if it is astringent, then don't put it, so as to avoid putting sand into the ground. In this way, Sun Qu learned about the characteristics of a type of soil and cultivation method. When attending the symposium, he heard the commune members talking about the soil layers of deep plowing, and he wrote down in his notebook how to deal with the layers of more than a dozen different soils. When he heard a new situation or a new practice at the meeting, he would find the commune member after the meeting to talk about it in detail. Sun Qu specially consulted the ten or so labor models with the most experience in wheat at the Shanxi Province Hongtong County Agricultural Activists Conference. He also has a notebook for summarizing questions. He organizes and classifies the experiences and questions he hears daily and records them in this notebook, learning, organizing, and improving at the same time.

After learning and summarizing the farmers' experience, Sun Qu has a more concrete understanding of how to improve soil fertility to increase yields in current agriculture. Recently, he and the teachers and students sent to the countryside, as well as more than ten old farmers from the Xionghuo People's Commune, have cultivated more than 20 mu of experimental fields, conducting research experiments on deep plowing, seeding amount, the use of antibiotic fertilizers, and gibberellin seed soaking. He also has a new idea: to absorb the farmers' experience, focus on the soil, and comprehensively study the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, and compile a Chinese Agricultural Soil Science and Cultivation Science in the future. He hopes that this book, once compiled, can promote production and also change the past situation of teaching being divorced from practice.

Recently, Sun Qu returned to Beijing Agricultural University from Shanxi to summarize his work. He told the reporter: "For many years, I have been hoping that my work can play a role in agricultural production, and today I can say that a real beginning has been made."

    农学家到农村取宝
    ——记孙渠教授下放农村五个月的收获
    本报记者　朱　彬
    去年9月初，下放到山西洪洞县雄火人民公社的一批北京农业大学的师生当中，有一位孙渠教授。他穿着蓝卡其布的制服，戴着一顶有遮沿的圆顶帽，看起来很像一个农民熟识的农村干部。他除了给社员们系统地讲哲学，有时也讲一些耕作学、农业土壤学以外，每天更多的时间是跟社员们一起劳动。他推着小车向地里送粪，他割玉米谷子、深翻地。休息的时候跟社员们坐在地头聊天，请社员讲各种耕作经验。晚上临睡前，他就把这些学来的点点滴滴经验记在本子上。五个月来，他所收集的经验已写满了五个练习本。他也常常应邀出席县里、省里的生产积极分子会议，和县的、省的劳动模范们座谈各种耕作经验，到那些劳动模范家里去访问参观。根据这些资料，孙渠已写出了小麦、红薯、玉米丰产经验的论文，还在写棉花丰产经验的论文。在已写好的论文中，他阐述了按照各种不同条件进行深耕、密植、施肥、浇灌的方法。
    从1938年，孙渠就开始农业土壤学的研究和教学工作。可是过去所受的教育和习惯的治学道路，使他脱不开书本的圈子。前年，当农民取得深翻二、三尺的增产经验时，而孙渠还在做深耕一尺二的研究试验。他所教的学生到农村后，也不能解决多少实际问题。去年双反时，他迫切要求联系实际。去年8月间北京农业大学党委传达了党中央关于农林院校下放农村的决定后，孙渠就把这个决定看作他个人结束理论脱离实际，转向理论联系实际的大好时机。
    孙渠一到农村后，就被那里的丰富经验吸引住了。冬季向麦田里浇水，农民叫“灌冬水”。什么时候灌，灌多少？不但书本上没有，孙渠在试验室里也没有学到过这方面的知识。而农民是在“一冻一化”时灌，也就是在白天冰雪融化时灌水，夜晚上冻前，地里能够渗多少水就灌多少水，免得水多了在地面上结冰损伤麦苗。怎样防止棉花落铃？这也是种植棉花中的一个主要问题。孙渠去山西省安邑县东风人民公社时，就看到那里的农民郭震西从施肥上解决了这个问题。郭震西按棉花生长期施不同的肥料，先施磷肥，开花坐桃时施氮肥。孙渠感到这有着很重要的科学道理，先施磷肥不施氮肥可以使根子长得好，避免叶子痴长，而妨碍开花坐桃。坐桃时施氮肥，可促使棉桃生长，使棉桃长的又多又大，这就可避免落铃了。孙渠所在的雄火人民公社里，八百亩土地上亩产八百零二斤小麦，附近的另外一个公社一亩地里生长出了三万多斤的红薯……，这些更打开了孙渠的眼界。孙渠开始感到有些农学家认为农民丰产是靠干劲，没有科学道理的看法，不只是误解，而且是没有根据的。正是农村，是自己最好的课堂、最好的研究室，而社员们都是自己最好的老师。
    社员们丰富的农事经验，都分散在各人的脑子里。为了向他们学习，孙渠给社员当徒弟，跟社员一起劳动，见到问题就寻根究底的学。有一次他看到社员在河滩地上不耕就播种麦子。这是出乎平常的做法。孙渠就请社员谈这样做的道理。社员对他说这块河滩地是淤泥，土粘而潮湿，一耕土就糊成块儿，块儿一干就不长庄稼。社员还抓起了一把土，在手指间搓了搓说：滑的是土，涩的是砂子，放淤时也要看土的情况，滑时就放，涩时就不放，以免把砂子放到地里。这样，孙渠就又了解了一种土壤的特性和耕作方法。参加座谈会时，他听到社员们在谈深耕土壤层次时，他就在笔记本上写下了十多种不同土壤的层次应该如何处理的问题。在会上听到一点新情况、新做法，会外他就找到那位社员来细谈。山西省洪洞县农业积极分子大会上小麦经验最丰富的十多位劳动模范，孙渠都专门地请教过他们。他还有一个归纳问题的笔记本。他把日常所听来的经验和问题整理分类后，记在这个本子上，边学边整理提高。
  学习和总结农民的经验之后，孙渠对当前农业上如何提高土壤肥力来增加产量，有了比较具体的了解。最近他和下放师生以及雄火人民公社的十多位老农一起耕种了二十多亩试验田，就深耕、播种量、采用抗生菌肥料、赤霉素浸种等问题进行着研究试验。他还有个新的想法：吸取农民的经验，以土壤为主，全面的研究八字宪法，将来编一部中国农业土壤学、耕作学。他希望这部书编成后能推动生产，也能改变过去教学脱离实际的状况。
    最近，孙渠由山西回北京农业大学总结工作。他对记者说：“多少年来就盼望自己的工作能对农业生产起作用，而今天可以说有了真正的开端。”
