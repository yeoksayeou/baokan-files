Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Washington dispatch: Associated Press news analyst James Marlow admitted on the 3rd that the Soviet giant is growing rapidly, and the West's so-called advantage is gone forever.

Marlow said: "The feeling of 'Western superiority' is gone forever.  What has replaced it is unease and self-criticism.  Ten years of effort have brought Russia confidence and achievement."

He pointed out that ten years ago, compared with the United States, the Soviet Union was still lagging behind in economic terms. In this situation, the United States had always hoped that the Soviet regime would be overthrown one day. But now, "almost no one harbors such hopes anymore. There is no evidence to support such hopes. Today, Russia has indisputably become the second economic power in the world,... it shows very amazing scientific and industrial progress."

Ten years ago, the United States was still superior to the Soviet Union militarily; but "this is no longer the case."

The author admits that even in terms of military strength, which the United States often uses to intimidate the people of the world, the United States has lost its so-called advantage. He specifically mentioned the Soviet Union's achievements in intercontinental rockets. He said: "In the autumn of 1957, the Russians invented their artificial satellite, which dealt a severe blow to American complacency. Because they launched the moon rocket in 1959, this shows their continued lead and advantage in this regard. The Senate Armed Services Subcommittee began a thorough investigation last week into the state of U.S. missile development in comparison with Russia, which is the best proof of American unease."

Marlow also believes that Secretary of State Dulles' decision to go to Europe this time to consult with the British, French, and West Germans on the Berlin issue and the German issue will also "indirectly praise Russia's growing power," because the Soviet Union's proposals on the status of West Berlin have caused "serious unease in the West." He said: "It seems that Dulles' purpose in this trip is to consolidate the lineup, provide assurances, and stabilize emotions."

    美联社新闻分析员承认
    苏联巨人飞速成长  西方优势一去不返
    新华社4日讯　华盛顿消息：美联社新闻分析员詹姆斯·马劳3日承认，苏联巨人在飞速成长，而西方的所谓优势已经一去不复返。
    马劳说：对于“西方优势的感觉已经一去不复返了。代替它的是不安和自我批评。十年的功夫给俄国带来了自信和成就。”
    他指出，十年以前，同美国比较起来，苏联在经济方面还落在后面。在这种情况下，美国方面一直希望苏维埃政权有朝一日会被推翻。但是现在“差不多已经不再抱任何这种希望了。已经没有任何证据来支持这种希望了。今天俄国无可置辩地已经成为世界第二个经济强国，……它表现出非常惊人的科学和工业进展。”
    十年前，美国在军事上还胜过苏联；而“现在却不是这样了”。
    作者承认，就是在美国经常用来恫吓世界人民的军事力量方面，美国也已经丧失了它的所谓优势。他特别提到苏联在洲际火箭方面的成就。他说：“1957年秋季俄国人发明了他们的人造卫星，这给了美国的自满情绪一次严重打击。由于他们在1959年发射了月球火箭，这就表明他们在这方面的继续领先和优势。（美国）参议院军备小组委员会上周开始彻底调查美国在同俄国对比之下的导弹发展状况，这就再好不过地证明了美国的不安。”
    马劳还认为，美国国务卿杜勒斯这次决定去欧洲就柏林问题和德国问题同英国人、法国人和西德人会商一事，也将“间接地赞扬了俄国日益增长的力量”，因为苏联关于西柏林地位的建议已经使“西方感到严重的不安”。他说：“看来杜勒斯此行的目的是整顿阵容、提供保证和稳定情绪。”
