Xinhua News Agency dispatches: Fraternal parties from Finland, Spain, and other countries delivered congratulatory messages at the afternoon meeting on January 30th and the morning meeting on January 31st of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

At the afternoon meeting on the 30th, Ville Pessi, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Finland, extended congratulations to the delegates of the 21st Congress on behalf of the members of the Communist Party of Finland and the working people of the whole country.

Pessi said that Finland is very concerned about the progress of the Soviet Union. We rejoice with you in the achievements of the Soviet Union.

Pessi pointed out that Finland has experienced a crisis of overproduction in the past year and a half. The national unemployment situation has reached a record-breaking level. In this situation, Finland is in extreme need of developing trade with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. However, he said, this matter has been obstructed by powerful figures in our country.

Pessi said that we believe it is one of our tasks to make the Finnish people understand the achievements of the Soviet Union and the role of the Soviet Union in the struggle for the freedom of all peoples and for peace.

Pessi went on to point out that the realization of the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan will be significant not only for the various nationalities of the Soviet Union but also for the entire international communist workers' movement. He said that the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have achieved a complete victory for socialism in the Soviet Union and are our role models.

Also delivering a congratulatory message at the afternoon meeting was Dolores Ibárruri, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Spain. She said that in our fraternal and warm congratulations, we express the feelings of Spanish workers, peasants, farm laborers, progressive intellectuals, and small bourgeoisie—the feelings of the entire working and progressive Spain, who see their future in the achievements of the Soviet people, and the future of all free people in the world.

Ibárruri spoke about the situation of the Communist Party of Spain, trade union organizations, and the Spanish people in opposing the Franco dictatorship. Despite the fanatical police persecution suffered by the participants in this struggle, the struggle continues unabated.

Ibárruri said that the Communist Party’s years of experience is now and will continue to be an inexhaustible treasure trove for the Communist Party of Spain. Ibárruri also said that we are proud that the first rocket launched into space was a Soviet rocket. We are also proud that you are the first to embark on the road to building communism.

Severo Aguirre, Chairman of the National Committee of the People's Socialist Party of Cuba, delivered a speech at the morning meeting on the 31st. He said that the Cuban people are watching the great achievements of the Soviet Union with deep sympathy and genuine interest. In those dark days in Cuba, the Soviet Union's three Earth satellites brought joy to Cuban patriots. He said that the Soviet Union's launch of a cosmic rocket is a new victory over the dark forces of capitalism. At the same time as the Soviet Union achieved this victory, the Cuban people also achieved victory over the imperialist oppressors.

Severo Aguirre said that the victory of the Soviet Union is an effective aid to the people of all countries who, like the Cuban people, are engaged in the struggle against imperialism. American imperialism enabled the brutal Batista dictator to seize power in order to turn Cuba into a colony and tie it to the chariot of imperialism. The Batista group, under the tattered banner of anti-communism, persecuted domestic democratic forces. However, the Cuban Communists, inspired by Marxism-Leninism, have never lost confidence in the people. The People's Socialist Party, in its underground activities, established contact with the people at the cost of the lives of many of its leaders, and struggled to unite all revolutionary forces.

Severo Aguirre pointed out that the Batista dictatorship has been overthrown. In this struggle, the Cuban Communists stood at the forefront of the insurgent masses and won the respect of their fighting comrades.

Severo Aguirre said that our experience refutes the claims of some people who try to argue that it is impossible to successfully conduct an anti-imperialist struggle in Latin American countries. He said that when all the people stand up and take the destiny of the country into their own hands, victory is guaranteed.

He emphasized that the victory was made possible because of the new changes in the balance of power on the international stage, the increased strength of the socialist camp countries, and the victories of the Asian and African people in the struggle against imperialist forces. Latin America is no longer a reserve force for American imperialism.

Severo Aguirre went on to say that the American propaganda machine is trying to deceive public opinion in order to cover up the aggressive nature of American policy and weaken public support for Cuban patriots. The United States threatens Cuba with economic blockade and even armed aggression. The United States is conducting an anti-communist movement in order to isolate the left-wing parties.

Severo Aguirre finally thanked the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries for their solidarity with the cause of the Cuban people.

    全世界共产党人为苏联成就骄傲
    芬兰西班牙古巴兄弟党代表祝贺苏共代表大会
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会1月30日下午和31日上午会议上，芬兰、西班牙等国兄弟党致了贺词。
    在30日下午会议上，芬兰共产党中央委员会总书记维勒·培西代表芬兰共产党党员和全国劳动人民对第二十一次代表大会的代表们表示祝贺。
    培西说，芬兰十分关心苏联的进步。我们同你们一起为苏联的成就而欢欣鼓舞。
    培西指出，在最近一年半内芬兰出现了生产过剩危机。全国失业情况达到了打破纪录的水平。在这种情况下芬兰本来是极端需要同苏联和人民民主国家发展贸易的。但是，他说，这件事却受到了我国有势力人士的阻挠。
    培西说，我们认为，使芬兰人民了解苏联的成就，了解苏联在争取各国人民自由、争取和平的斗争中的作用，是我们的任务之一。
    培西接着指出，苏联七年计划的实现，将不仅对于苏联各族人民、而且对于整个国际共产主义工人运动，都有意义。他说，在苏联共产党领导下使社会主义在苏联获得了彻底胜利的苏联各族人民，是我们的榜样。
    在下午会议上致贺词的还有西班牙共产党中央委员会总书记伊巴露丽。她说，在我们的兄弟般的热烈的祝词中，我们表达了西班牙工人、农民、雇农、进步知识分子和小资产阶级——整个劳动和进步西班牙的感情，他们在苏联人民的成就中看到了自己未来，看到了世界各国全体自由人民的未来。
    伊巴露丽谈到了西班牙共产党、工会组织和西班牙人民反对佛朗哥独裁统治的情况。尽管这一斗争的参加者遭到了疯狂的警察迫害，但是斗争仍在不断进行。
    伊巴露丽说，你们共产党多年的经验现在是并且将来还是西班牙共产党的取之不尽的宝库。伊巴露丽又说，我们所骄傲的是第一个发向宇宙空间的火箭是苏联的火箭。还使我们感到骄傲的是，你们首先走上了建设共产主义的道路。
    古巴人民社会党全国委员会主席西维罗·阿吉雷在31日上午会议上致词。他说，古巴人民怀着深深的同情和真正的兴趣注视着苏联的巨大成就。在古巴那些黑暗的日子里，苏联的三个地球卫星给古巴爱国者带来了喜悦。他说，苏联发射宇宙火箭是对资本主义黑暗势力的新的胜利。在苏联取得这个胜利的同时，古巴人民也取得了对帝国主义压迫者的胜利。
    西维罗·阿吉雷说，苏联的胜利是对和古巴人民一样在进行着反对帝国主义斗争的各国人民的有效援助。美国帝国主义使残暴的巴蒂斯塔独裁者掌握政权，以便把古巴变成殖民地和把它拴在帝国主义的战车上。巴蒂斯塔集团打着反共产主义的破烂旗帜，对国内民主力量进行迫害活动。但是，受到马克思列宁主义学说鼓舞的古巴共产党人从来也没有失去对人民的信心。人民社会党在地下活动中以自己的许多领导人的生命为代价和人民建立了联系，为争取一切革命力量的联合进行了斗争。
    西维罗·阿吉雷指出，巴蒂斯塔独裁政权已被推翻了。在这场斗争中，古巴共产党人站在起义群众的最前列，并且博得了战斗同志的尊敬。
    西维罗·阿吉雷说，我们的经验驳斥了某些人的说法，这些人企图说明在拉丁美洲国家进行反帝国主义斗争是不可能成功的。他说，当全体人民站起来并把国家命运掌握在自己手中的时候，胜利就有了保证。
    他强调说，胜利之所以成为可能，是由于国际舞台上的力量对比发生了新的变化，是由于社会主义阵营国家的威力增强了，是由于亚非人民在反对帝国主义势力的斗争中取得了胜利。拉丁美洲不再是美帝国主义的后备力量了。
    西维罗·阿吉雷接着说，美国的宣传机构企图欺骗社会舆论，以便掩盖美国政策的侵略性质，并削弱公众对古巴爱国者的广泛支持。美国用经济封锁、甚至武装侵略来威胁古巴。美国进行反共运动，以便孤立左翼党派。
    西维罗·阿吉雷最后感谢世界各国共产党和工人党对古巴人民事业的声援。
