Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 23rd: Our correspondent reports: In the vast countryside of the Soviet Union, a massive production competition movement aimed at completing the main livestock product production tasks stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule has taken shape. The central content of the movement is a surge in meat production and the expansion of livestock and agricultural product production. This competition movement, inspired by the Seven-Year Plan and the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of per capita livestock product production in the coming years, is being launched nationwide.

The initiators of this competition are the agricultural workers of Ryazan Oblast. After discussing the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan and the resolutions of the December Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union last year, they issued a challenge to agricultural workers across the country on January 9 to drastically increase meat production. They decided to quadruple meat production in the first year of the Seven-Year Plan and deliver 150,000 tons of meat to the state by the end of this year. The oblast's Seven-Year Plan for expanding meat production will be completed in two years. The specific methods proposed by the oblast to complete the task are: each collective farm and state farm should breed more piglets, increasing the number of piglets by 750,000 this year compared to last year; expand feedlots, plant more high-yielding feed crops—corn, and ensure that the yield of corn per hectare is no less than 400 centners; and build new livestock sheds that can accommodate 140,000 head of livestock. The production of other livestock products will also be greatly increased.

The Ryazan Oblast's competition initiative quickly received an enthusiastic response from rural areas across the country.

Moscow Oblast, Stavropol Krai, Kharkov Oblast, Moldova, Estonia, and other places that have always been among the best in livestock production took the lead in accepting the challenge. Moscow Oblast decided to double meat production this year compared to last year, increasing it by 140,000 tons. To this end, 153,000 cattle and 800,000 pigs will be bred within a year. The entire Seven-Year Plan will also be completed ahead of schedule. By 1965, every 100 hectares of agricultural land will produce 105 centners of meat (calculated by slaughter weight) and 904 centners of milk. Some districts in this oblast, such as the Krasno-Polyansky District, will increase meat production from 113 centners to 181 centners per 100 hectares of agricultural land this year. The entire oblast will open up 50,000 hectares of grassland pastures within two years in order to store more abundant feed.

The farmers of Stavropol Krai decided to produce 250,000 tons of meat this year, an increase of one and a half times compared to last year. Kharkov Oblast's Seven-Year Plan for meat production will be completed in five years. In 1958, this oblast produced 68 centners of meat per 100 hectares of agricultural land, which will increase to 112 centners by 1963. The oblast's meat production this year will double compared to last year.

The agricultural workers of Estonia decided to complete the Seven-Year Plan for meat production in five years. In the last two years of the Seven-Year Plan, they will produce an additional 48,000 tons of meat for the state.

The agricultural workers of Kiev Oblast promised to complete the Seven-Year Plan for meat production in five years. By 1963, this oblast will produce 110 centners of meat per 100 hectares of agricultural land. In order to complete this increased production task, the collective farms throughout the oblast have organized specialized feeding teams, including 50,000 members of the Communist Youth League and youth. They decided to expand the corn planting area by 230,000 hectares and strive for a harvest of no less than 400 centners per hectare.

In Almaty Oblast, Kazakh Republic, meat production will be doubled in the two years of 1959-1960, which means that the Seven-Year Plan will be completed in two years.

This competition movement is also being launched in Georgia, Uzbekistan, Belarus, Tajikistan, and other places.

With the substantial increase in meat production, the production of milk and oil will also be greatly improved in various places.

While a fierce competition to increase meat production is being carried out between oblasts, a heated competition is also unfolding between districts, farms, and state farms.

The livestock production competition movement, centered on increased meat production, has huge national economic significance. This means that the struggle to catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of per capita production of milk, oil, and meat has entered a new stage. Currently, this competition is being carried out in depth.

### 争取提前完成七年计划　突击增产肉类和农产品  苏联农业劳动者展开热烈竞赛

    争取提前完成七年计划　突击增产肉类和农产品
    苏联农业劳动者展开热烈竞赛
    新华社莫斯科23日电　本社记者报道：在苏联广大的农村，一个规模巨大的提前完成七年计划规定的主要畜产品生产任务的生产竞赛运动已经形成。运动的中心内容是突击增产肉类和扩大畜、农产品的生产。这个竞赛运动是在七年计划和苏共中央关于争取在最近几年内在按人口平均计算的畜产品生产方面赶上和超过美国的号召的鼓舞下，在全国范围内展开的。
    这个竞赛的发起人是梁赞州的农业劳动者。他们在讨论七年计划控制数字和苏共中央去年12月全会的决议以后，在1月9日向全国农业劳动者提出了急剧增加肉类生产竞赛的挑战。他们决定在七年计划头一年内把肉类生产翻两番，到今年年底前交给国家十五万吨肉类。全州的七年扩大肉类生产任务要在两年内完成。这个州提出的完成任务的具体方法是：每个集体农庄和国营农场要多繁殖猪仔，今年要比去年增加小猪七十五万口；扩大饲料场，多种高产饲料——玉蜀黍，并保证每公顷土地的玉蜀黍产量不少于四百公担；修建可以容纳十四万头牲畜的新畜舍。其他畜产品的生产也将大力提高。
    梁赞州的竞赛倡议很快就获得了全国各地农村的热烈响应。
    在畜牧业生产方面一直名列前茅的莫斯科州、斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区、哈尔科夫州、摩尔达维亚、爱沙尼亚等地首先起来应战。莫斯科州决定在今年使肉类生产比去年翻一番，即增产十四万吨。为此，一年内将繁殖牛十五万三千头，猪八十万口。整个七年计划也将提前完成。到1965年每一百公顷农业用地将产一百零五公担肉类（按屠宰重计算）、九百零四公担牛奶。这个州的一些区、如克罗斯诺—波利扬斯基区今年每一百公顷农业用地生产的肉类将由一百一十三公担增为一百八十一公担。全州两年内将增辟五万公顷青草牧场，以便更充裕地贮藏饲料。
    斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区的农民们决定今年生产肉类二十五万吨，即比去年增加一倍半。哈尔科夫州七年的肉类生产任务将在五年内完成。1958年这个州每百公顷农业用地曾出产肉类六十八公担，到1963年将增为一百一十二公担。全州今年肉类产量将比去年增加一倍。
    爱沙尼亚的农业劳动者决定在五年内完成七年肉类生产计划，在七年计划的后两年，他们将为国家多生产四万八千吨肉类。
    基辅州的农业劳动者保证要在五年内完成七年肉类生产计划。到1963年时，这个州每一百公顷农业用地将生产一百一十公担肉类。为了完成这一增产任务，全州各集体农庄已组织了专门的饲养工作队，其中包括五万共青团员与青年。他们决定要扩大玉蜀黍种植面积二十三万公顷，并争取每公顷收获量不少于四百公担。
    哈萨克共和国的阿拉木图州在1959年—1960年两年内肉类将增产两倍，这就是说，七年计划将在两年内完成。
    这一竞赛运动也正在格鲁吉亚、乌兹别克、白俄罗斯、塔吉克等地展开。
    随着肉类大大增产的同时，各地牛奶、油脂生产也将有很大的提高。
    在州与州开展猛增肉类生产的竞赛的同时，区与区、农庄与农庄、农场与农场之间也展开了热烈的竞赛。
  以肉类增产为中心的畜牧业生产竞赛运动有着巨大的国民经济意义。这意味着在牛奶、油脂、肉类生产按人口平均计算，赶上和超过美国的斗争已进入了新的阶段。目前，这一竞赛正在深入开展中。
