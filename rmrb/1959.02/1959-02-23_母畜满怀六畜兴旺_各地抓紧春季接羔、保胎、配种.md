Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd – The prelude to striving for an even greater leap forward in animal husbandry this year has been unveiled in provinces and autonomous regions such as Yunnan, Henan, Shandong, Liaoning, Jilin, Gansu, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia.

Currently, these regions are carrying out activities such as lambing, fetal protection, and mating, based on their specific local conditions. The herdsmen of Qinghai Province, having just finished winter lambing, are now joyfully welcoming the spring lambs with the cheerful spirit of a bountiful harvest. According to recent statistics from the Huangnan, Yushu, and Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures, and the Haixi Mongol-Tibetan-Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, the survival rate of the lambs born has reached over 90%. In order to ensure that over eight million pregnant livestock in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region do not miscarry around the Qingming Festival, a movement to increase and protect livestock has been launched. In Yunnan Province, the mating work for breeding-age female livestock is proceeding intensely, and seventeen counties including Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, Qujing Special District, and Songming have already achieved full-term pregnancy for their female livestock. In Shandong and Henan provinces, the number of pregnant female livestock has reached about 50% and 60% respectively. Currently, farmers in the two provinces are striving to achieve full-term pregnancy for their female livestock before the "May Day" holiday. Jilin Province, based on its achievements in livestock mating, is continuing to move forward in big strides, striving to use superior breeding male livestock for mating all female livestock this year.

The realization of people's communes has provided extremely favorable conditions for a greater leap forward in animal husbandry. Now, all provinces and autonomous regions have formulated plans for greater development of animal husbandry this year. Many regions have launched a wave of learning from advanced experiences, catching up with advanced examples, and striving to be advanced in order to strive for an even greater leap forward in 1959, through on-site meetings to promote advanced experiences. In recent months, Gansu Province has planted more than twenty red flags for the great leap forward in animal husbandry throughout the province through on-site meetings. This has brought about a new situation in the mass movement on the animal husbandry front in the province. People's communes in various places have established more than 80,000 livestock farms, and under the slogan of "all mated, all successful, all born, all alive, all strong," they have launched mass mating and breeding work. Provinces and regions such as Henan, Shandong, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia have relatively widely promoted advanced experiences in estrus induction for female livestock, breaking the conventional seasonal mating and establishing new rules for year-round mating.

Vigorously establishing livestock mating stations, artificial insemination stations, and selecting and retaining superior breeding male livestock are important measures taken by various regions to strive for a greater leap forward in animal husbandry and to improve livestock breeds. The number of artificial insemination stations in Henan Province has increased from 550 in December last year to the current 940. Qujing Special District in Yunnan Province has established more than 1,700 mating stations and more than 80 artificial insemination stations; each special district (prefecture) in this province has trained thousands to tens of thousands of mating personnel. While establishing mating stations and insemination stations, Shandong Province has selected more than 20,000 superior and robust breeding livestock. In order to strive for the improvement of livestock breeds, Jilin Province has expanded the mating range of five state-run stud farms from the original six counties to twenty counties; the number of mating stations has increased from the original eighty-three to one hundred and eighteen. Now, the number of mares in the province that have conceived through crossbreeding with improved breeds is equal to the total crossbreeding improvement during the first Five-Year Plan period.

Various regions have also universally launched work to love and protect livestock. Pastoral areas are vigorously building pens and solving the problem of water sources for pastures; agricultural areas are universally and actively improving livestock feeding management. People's communes in agricultural and pastoral areas have further established and improved livestock disease prevention and control organizations, strengthening epidemic prevention and medical treatment. While building a large number of pens, the Ulanqab League of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region transferred more than 400 Party members and Youth League members and more than 70,000 commune members to form professional teams to strengthen disaster prevention and livestock protection. In the movement for the safe entry of livestock into spring in Jilin Province, work such as checking livestock condition, checking feeding management, checking epidemic prevention and control, and checking mating preparation was carried out, which greatly promoted the feeding management of livestock.

    母畜满怀六畜兴旺
    各地抓紧春季接羔、保胎、配种
    改善饲养管理　加强疫病防治
    选留优良种畜　提倡人工授精
    新华社22日讯　力争今年畜牧业实现更大跃进的序幕，已在云南、河南、山东、辽宁、吉林、甘肃、青海、内蒙古等省、区揭开。
    当前，这些地区正在根据当地的具体情况，分别开展接羔、保胎和配种等活动。青海省的牧民刚刚接罢冬羔，又以喜庆丰收的欢快心情接产春羔，据黄南、玉树、海南三个藏族自治州和海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州最近统计，已经产下的羔羊成活率达90％以上。内蒙古自治区的牧民为了保证八百多万头在清明节前后产仔的母畜不流产，已经掀起了增畜保畜运动。云南省的适龄母畜配种工作正在紧张进行，大理白族自治州、曲靖专区和嵩明等十七个县已经实现了母畜满怀。山东、河南两省配种怀胎的母畜已经分别达到50％和60％左右，当前两省农民正为力争“五一”节前实现母畜满怀而努力。吉林省在牲畜配种已获成就的基础上正在继续大步前进，力争今年全用优良种公畜为母畜配种。
    人民公社化的实现，为畜牧业的更大跃进提供了极为有利的条件。现在，各省、区都制定了今年畜牧业更大发展的规划。很多地区通过推广先进经验的现场会议，掀起了学先进、赶先进、争先进力争1959年更大跃进的热潮。甘肃省最近几个月，通过现场会议共在全省插起二十多面畜牧业大跃进的红旗。使全省畜牧业战线上的群众运动出现了新的局面，各地人民公社已经建立了畜牧场八万多处，在“全配、全准、全产、全活、全壮”的口号下，展开了群众性的配种繁殖工作。河南、山东、吉林、内蒙古等省区比较普遍地推广了母畜催情的先进经验，打破了季节配种的常规，建立了常年配种的新规。
    大力建立牲畜配种站、人工授精站和选留优良种公畜，是各地为了力争畜牧业更大跃进和改良牲畜所采取的重要措施之一。河南省的人工授精站已从去年12月的五百五十个发展到目前的九百四十个。云南省曲靖专区已经建立配种站一千七百多个，人工授精站八十多个；这个省每个专区（州）都培养了数千到上万的配种人员。山东省在建立配种站和授精站的同时，已经选出二万多头优壮种畜。吉林省为了力争实现牲畜良种化，五处国营种马场的配种范围，已由原来的六个县扩大到二十个县；配种站由原来的八十三处扩大到一百一十八处，现在全省用良种杂交受胎的母马，已经等于第一个五年计划期间杂交改良的总和。
    各地还普遍展开了爱畜保畜工作。牧区大力修建圈棚，解决牧场水源问题；农业区普遍积极改善牲畜饲养管理。农、牧区的各人民公社还都进一步建立和健全牲畜疫病防治组织，加强防疫和医疗。内蒙古自治区乌兰察布盟各人民公社在修建了大量圈棚的同时，抽调四百多名党团员和七万多名社员，组成专业队，加强防灾保畜等工作。吉林省在牲畜安全入春运动中，开展了查畜膘、查饲养管理、查疫病防治、查配种准备等工作，大大促进了对牲畜的饲养管理。
