    Every Marxist and revolutionary must not only have clear and lofty revolutionary goals but also have a practical work style of doing a good job in the present. Without lofty ideals, one will lose the direction of progress; without grasping the main problems of the present and solving them, the revolutionary cause cannot advance smoothly. Seeing the future and grasping the present are the fundamental principles for carrying out all our work. The same principle should be closely grasped and followed when dealing with the tool reform movement.
    On the agricultural front, our long-term goal is to realize agricultural mechanization and electrification. The realization of this task, as pointed out in the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, will fundamentally change China's farming system, realize a comprehensive revolution in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and thoroughly change the face of the entire agricultural front; it will greatly increase the yield per unit area and China's labor productivity, thereby fundamentally changing the backward situation of "500 million farmers struggling to feed themselves," and drawing a large number of laborers from the agricultural front to carry out industrial and other socialist construction undertakings, greatly accelerating China's socialist construction process. The people of the whole country should actively strive in all aspects to realize the great ideal of agricultural mechanization and electrification as soon as possible. The great leap forward in China's industry and agriculture since last year has made it possible to greatly advance the date of realizing agricultural mechanization and electrification. This is something that should be rejoiced by the people of the whole country. However, it must also be seen that agricultural mechanization and electrification cannot be realized immediately at present, and the most important issue at present is to reform and improve existing tools. While looking forward to a bright future, we must conscientiously grasp the key to current work. Relaxing today will affect tomorrow; failing to firmly grasp the current tool reform will inevitably delay the early realization of mechanization and electrification.
    The realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification must be based on the highly developed level of industries such as iron and steel, machinery, electricity, and fuel. Although China's industrial production has made great progress during the First Five-Year Plan, and especially a great leap forward in the past year, it is still impossible to immediately meet the needs of agricultural mechanization and electrification. This is one aspect. On the other hand, agricultural mechanization and electrification is a continuous process of scientific and technological development. Every machine goes from low-level to high-level, from simple to complex. China is a vast country, and the realization of mechanization requires not only a large number of machines but also a very complex variety of machines, models, and specifications. It requires agricultural machines suitable for plains, as well as machines suitable for mountainous areas; it needs machines suitable for paddy fields, as well as machines suitable for dry land; it needs machines suitable for this crop, as well as machines suitable for that crop. Where do so many, various, and diverse machines come from? We can refer to and learn from foreign agricultural machines, but more importantly, we must gain experience from China's production practice. The current large-scale tool reform has special significance in this regard. On the one hand, the tool reform movement is the reform, development, and improvement of old-fashioned tools, and on the other hand, it is also creating conditions for the further implementation of mechanization.
    This is exactly the case. Many good agricultural machines have emerged in last year's tool reform movement, such as rice transplanters, rapid harvesting machines, rope-traction machines, etc. These new agricultural machines, especially rope-traction machines, are likely to be a very important foundation for China's realization of agricultural mechanization. Therefore, for the sake of tomorrow's agricultural mechanization and electrification, we must firmly grasp today's tool reform movement. Chairman Mao once told us: "The two articles, the first part and the second part, can only be done well if the first part is done well." This principle also applies to agricultural tool reform. Only by doing a good job in the first part of tool reform can we do a good job in the second part of mechanization.
    Doing a good job in the current tool reform movement also has more urgent practical significance. This year is the second year of the three years of hard work. The task on the agricultural front is to victoriously complete and overfulfill the production targets of 1,050 billion catties of grain and 100 million dan of cotton proposed by the Party Central Committee, and strive for a greater leap forward in the production of oil crops, hemp, and other crops. How can we achieve the leap forward plan for grain, cotton, and other aspects? The key issue is to earnestly and comprehensively implement the "Eight-Character Charter" under the leadership of Party committees at all levels. The realization of each word of the "Eight-Character Charter" means that a large amount of labor must be expended. Although China has a large rural population, the existing labor force is still far from meeting the needs. What should we do? The most effective method is to vigorously carry out tool reform and greatly increase labor productivity. A rope-traction plow can improve efficiency by two or three times compared to an ordinary plow; it can improve efficiency by more than ten times compared to using a shovel; a rapid harvesting machine can improve efficiency by three or four times compared to manual labor. There are many other new tools, some of which improve efficiency by one or two times compared to old-fashioned tools, and some improve efficiency by three or four times or even more.
    Increasing labor efficiency by one or several times is particularly important for this year's production. Taking summer crops as an example, this year's wheat (rapeseed is in the same situation) is mostly densely planted. This change in the farming system also requires new tools to adapt to it. The original tools suitable for the old farming system and sparse planting are no longer applicable, and new tools must be manufactured. This year, due to deep plowing, sufficient fertilizer, dense planting, and the increasing strengthening of field management, wheat is growing very well, and many areas have launched a movement to produce 1,000 catties per mu.
    When an unprecedented bumper harvest arrives, how many people will be needed to harvest, transport, thresh, and thresh grain? What more efficient tools can be used to ensure timely harvesting, transportation, and threshing? Wheat is different from other crops. If it is not harvested in time after it matures, it will dry up, resulting in a loss of "falling ears." Time is short and the task is heavy. What methods can be taken to ensure a bumper harvest? We should now see all these new situations and prepare summer harvest tools as early as possible. At the same time, this year's spring plowing is also very heavy. An important part of doing a good job in spring plowing and sowing is to prepare complete spring plowing and sowing tools, promote the new spring plowing and sowing tools that have been manufactured with remarkable results in last year's tool reform movement, and continue to mobilize the masses to further reform spring plowing tools. This year, there is little rain and snow, and spring plowing and sowing and wheat rejuvenation require a large amount of water. All localities should also pay special attention to the repair of existing drainage and irrigation machinery and the addition of new drainage and irrigation tools.
    A battle to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production in 1959 is being vigorously launched in the vast fields of the motherland. In order to win the victory of spring plowing and sowing and to welcome the great summer harvest, all localities should seize the time, strengthen leadership, and launch a broader, deeper, more meticulous, and more effective tool reform movement without exception.

### 切切实实抓紧工具改革

    切切实实抓紧工具改革
    每一个马克思主义者和革命党人，都既要有明确的远大的革命目标，也要有作好当前工作的切实的工作作风。没有远大理想，就会迷失前进的方向；不抓住当前的主要问题加以解决，便不能使革命事业顺利前进。既看到将来，又抓住现在，这是我们进行一切工作的根本原则。对待工具改革运动，也同样应该紧紧掌握和遵守这个原则。
    在农业战线上，我们的远大目标是实现农业机械化、电气化。这个任务的实现，正像党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中所指出的，将从根本上改变我国的耕作制度，实现农林牧副渔全线大革命，彻底改变整个农业战线的面貌；将大大地提高单位面积产量和我国的劳动生产率，从而根本改变我国“五亿农民搞饭吃”的落后状况，并从农业战线上抽调出大批的劳动力进行工业和其他社会主义建设事业，大大加速我国的社会主义建设进程。全国人民都应该从各方面积极努力，争取农业机械化、电气化的伟大理想早日实现。去年以来我国工农业的大跃进，使农业实现机械化、电气化的日子可能大大提前。这是值得全国人民欢欣鼓舞的。但是，也必须看到，农业机械化、电气化，毕竟不是目前马上可以实现的，当前最主要的问题还是对现有工具进行改革和提高。当我们瞻望着美好的将来的同时，必须切切实实地抓紧当前工作中的关键。放松了今天，也就会影响明天；不紧紧抓住当前的工具改革，也必然会推迟机械化、电气化事业的早日实现。
    实现农业机械化、电气化，必须建筑在钢铁、机械、电力、燃料等工业的高度发展水平上。我国的工业生产，虽然第一个五年计划期间有了很大的发展，特别在过去一年中有很大跃进，但目前仍然不可能马上满足农业机械化、电气化的需要。这是一方面。另一方面，农业机械化、电气化，是一个科学技术不断发展的过程。每一种机械，都是由低级到高级、由简单到复杂。我国是一个幅员广大的国家，实现机械化不仅需要机器的数量多，而且机器的种类、型号、规格也十分复杂。既要求有适合平原的农业机器，也要求有适合山地的机器；既需要有适合水田的机器，也需要有适合旱田的机器，既要有适合这种作物需要的机器，也要有适合那种作物需要的机器。这样许许多多、各种各样的机器从何而来呢？可以参考和学习外国的农业机器，但更重要的还是从我国生产的实践中取得经验。目前大搞工具改革，在这方面也具有特殊重要的意义。工具改革运动一方面是旧式工具的改革、发展、提高，另一方面也是为进一步实行机械化创造条件。
    事实也正是如此。去年的工具改革运动中已经出现了很多很好的农业机器，如插秧机、快速割禾器、绳索牵引机等等，这些新式的农业机器，特别是绳索牵引机，很可能是我国实现农业机械化的一个很重要的基础。因此，为了明天的农业机械化、电气化，必须抓紧今天的工具改革运动。毛主席曾经告诉我们：“两篇文章，上篇与下篇，只有上篇做好，下篇才能做好。”这个道理也适用于农具改革方面。首先把工具改革这篇文章做好，才能把机械化的文章做好。
    搞好当前的工具改革运动，还有更迫切的现实意义。今年是苦战三年的第二年，农业战线上的任务，是胜利完成并超额完成党中央提出的一万零五百亿斤粮食、一亿担棉花的生产指标，并争取油料、麻类等生产的更大跃进。怎样才能实现粮棉和其他方面的跃进计划呢？关键问题是要在各级党委的领导下，认真地全面地贯彻“八字宪法”。而“八字宪法”每一个字的实现，都意味着要支出大量的劳动力。尽管我国农村人口很多，但现有劳动力仍然远远不能满足需要。怎么办呢？最有效的一条方法，就是大搞工具改革，大力提高劳动生产率。一部绳索牵引犁比一般犁可以提高效率两、三倍；比人用锨翻地提高效率十倍以上；一部快速割禾器，比人工劳动提高效率三、四倍。其他还有很多的新式工具，有的比旧式工具提高效率一、二倍，有的提高三、四倍甚至更多。
    把劳动效率提高一倍或几倍，对今年生产说来，特别重要。以夏季作物为例，今年的小麦（油菜也有同样情况）大都是密植。这种耕作制度上的改变，也提出了要有新的工具与之适应。原来适合旧的耕作制度，适合稀植的工具不适用了，必须制造新的工具。今年小麦由于深耕、肥足、密植和田间管理工作的日益加强，麦子生长得十分良好，很多地区已经开展了亩产千斤运动。
    当空前的大丰收到来的时候，需要多少人收割、拉运、打场脱粒？采用什么更加效率高的工具才能保证及时收割、拉运、打场脱粒？麦子和别的作物不同，成熟以后如果不及时收割就会干枯，造成“落镰”的损失。时间短、任务大，采取什么办法才能保证丰产丰收？现在就应该看到这一切新的情况，及早作好夏收工具的准备。同时，今年春耕工作也很繁重，做好春耕播种工作很重要的一条就是把春耕播种工具准备齐全，把去年工具改革运动中已经制造出来的卓著成效的新式春耕播种工具推广，并继续发动群众，进一步改革春耕工具。今年雨雪少，春耕播种、麦子返青都需要大量用水，各地对旧有排灌机械的修理和新的排灌工具的添置，也应特别重视。
    一个为实现1959年农业生产更大更好更全面跃进的战斗，正在祖国广大的田野上热烈展开。为了春耕播种的胜利，为了迎接夏季大丰收，各地应抓紧时间，加强领导，无例外地开展一个更广泛、更深入、更细致、更有成效的工具改革运动。
