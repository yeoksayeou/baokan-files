Advanced Production Plans Are Everywhere

    Fan County, Shandong Province, is striving to achieve a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin of wheat this year. The well-known Zhangshi Commune in Guangdong Province has also set a target of increasing its total industrial and agricultural income by nearly two times compared to last year. As everyone can see, the cadres and masses there possess immense enthusiasm for production to achieve even greater leaps forward.

    Fan County's "double 1,000 jin" is a great leap forward in production; the Zhangshi Commune's 5,000 jin per mu of double-season rice is also a great leap forward. Does this mean that only achieving such high production targets counts as a great leap forward, and not reaching these figures does not?

    We should consider the conditions and conduct specific analyses of specific problems. In the vast countryside, production conditions vary greatly. Some regions have relatively poor natural conditions, and although the cadres and masses have made great efforts and production has greatly increased, the yield is still not very high compared to many high-yield areas.

    This year, all regions are making greater leaps forward. High-yield areas are certainly leaping forward, and low-yield areas are also leaping forward. Therefore, we cannot simply measure whether a production target is advanced based on the height of the number. Instead, we should look at the original conditions, how much effort has been made, and what specific measures have been developed to increase production.

    We hope that newspaper correspondents will promptly report on the advanced production targets and measures for increasing production in various types of regions this year, to help readers better and more comprehensively understand the situation of the great leap forward in the countryside.

### 先进生产计划处处有

    先进生产计划处处有
    山东范县今年力争实现小麦亩产双千斤，许多读者熟知的广东樟市公社也订出了今年工农业总收入比去年增加近两倍的增产计划。大家可以看到，为了实现更大的跃进，那里的干部和群众具有多么大的生产干劲。
    范县的双千斤是生产大跃进；樟市公社的两季稻亩产五千斤，也是大跃进。这是不是说只有达到他们这样高的生产指标才算大跃进，达不到这样的数字就不算大跃进呢？
  应当看条件，应当对具体问题作具体分析。在广大农村，生产条件是千差万别的。有些地区自然条件比较差，干部和群众虽然作了很大的努力，生产有很大增长，但是，同许多高产地区比较，产量还是不太高。
    今年各地都有更大跃进，高产地区固然在跃进，低产地区也在跃进。因此，生产指标是不是先进的问题，我们就不能单纯从数字的高低来衡量，而应当看他原来的条件，看他作了怎样大的努力，看他订出了什么样的具体的增产措施。
    我们希望报纸的通讯员把各类地区今年的先进生产指标和增产措施迅速反映出来，帮助读者更好更全面地了解农村大跃进的情况。
