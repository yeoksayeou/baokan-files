    Manufacturing Materials Ourselves Guarantees a Great Leap Forward
    Wuhan Iron and Steel and Daye Steel Plant Establish a Batch of Affiliated Factories
    Guangzhou Light Industry Department Runs its Own Raw Material Industry

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation is fully utilizing the superior conditions of a large enterprise to vigorously develop the machinery industry and building materials industry, producing some of the equipment and materials needed for its own construction.

    Currently, Wuhan Iron and Steel has formed a machinery network based on the Mechanical Repair Main Plant and the Electric Repair Workshop of the Power Plant. Since September of last year, the Mechanical Main Plant has produced 130 five-ton single-beam cranes, three sets of "Commune" brand universal rolling mills, one set of 35-ton open-hearth furnaces, and a batch of small converters and other complete sets of equipment. The instrument workshop of the Power Plant has also successfully trial-produced three types of instruments that were previously reliant on imports, including electronic potentiometers, thousandth pressure gauges, and high-voltage regulators.

    In order to increase the source of building materials, Wuhan Iron and Steel began constructing an affiliated steel plant in September of last year with an annual output of 200,000 tons of iron, 200,000 tons of steel, and 180,000 tons of steel products, as well as a cement plant with an annual output of 240,000 tons. Now, the affiliated steel plant has produced steel and iron, and the rolling mill workshop has also completed the factory building and foundation engineering. The calcination workshop, coal powder workshop, raw material storage, and clinker storage of the cement plant have all been built, and the ball mill workshop is under construction. After these factories are put into production, Wuhan Iron and Steel can solve part of its own needs for high-grade cement and small steel products for capital construction. In addition, each engineering company has now also established five or six small cement plants, which can produce some ordinary cement to meet part of the needs of general engineering.

    Our newspaper, Wuhan, 5th telegram: Daye Steel Plant is actively running satellite factories, striving to solve the supply of some auxiliary materials and spare parts itself, to ensure the production of more and better steel this year.

    In the past, Daye Steel Plant did not produce auxiliary materials (such as refractory materials, ferroalloys, etc.), and relied entirely on supplies from other places. Sometimes the supply was not timely enough. In order to ensure a greater leap forward this year, the plant decided to run satellite factories while striving for external assistance. Now, the plant has built a ferroalloy workshop with an annual output of 10,000 tons, which can produce more than 20 kinds of ferroalloys such as ferrosilicon, ferromanganese, and manganese silicon alloy; and built a furnace lining workshop, specializing in the use of dolomite to make furnace linings for alkaline converters. These two workshops have been put into production successively, which plays a significant role in ensuring the quality of steel and refining special steel well. They are also building a refractory material plant, first to build seven earth kilns with an annual output of 40,000 tons to produce some urgently needed refractory bricks; and then build several large foreign kilns with an annual output of 60,000 tons, striving to gradually achieve basic self-sufficiency in refractory materials.

    In strengthening the manufacturing power of spare parts, the plant is expanding the casting power of the mechanical department on one hand, and mobilizing various units to run small satellite factories themselves to manufacture simple machine tools. For example, the staff and workers of the rolling mill department and the mechanical department have already set up two small sand-turning factories, with a monthly output of more than 40 tons of castings.

    Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 5th telegram: The Guangzhou Light Industry Department uses the method of running its own raw material industry to solve the problem of insufficient raw materials in some factories and to ensure that light industrial production this year will have a greater leap forward than last year.

    From September of last year to the present, factories in the battery, glass, soap, rubber shoe, paper making, and match industries have built many raw material factories, which has effectively promoted the development of production. For example, due to the insufficient supply of carbon rods in the battery industry, Xinghua and Yangcheng Battery Factories, etc., have been running eight furnaces for burning carbon rods since September of last year. The output of each furnace per month is about 10 tons, which can meet part of the needs. This year, Guangzhou's output of laundry soap is to reach 11,000 tons, an increase of 100% over last year, but the hardened oil necessary for making soap cannot be supplied so much for a while. Now, the relevant departments have begun constructing a hardened oil factory in the Guangzhou Light Industry School, which can be completed in the first quarter, with an annual output of several thousand tons, and most of the raw materials for soap will be self-sufficient. The light industry department is running a synthetic rubber factory, which can be completed by the end of February, with an annual output of 20 tons. Dozens of such factories will be built this year in order to expand the production of rubber shoes. In addition, the Guangzhou Light Industry Department will recently run a variety of raw material industries such as caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, and nitric acid.

    In the process of running its own raw material industry, the Guangzhou Light Industry Department implemented the principle of relying mainly on indigenous methods and comprehensive utilization. These factories have the characteristics of low investment and quick results. The refractory material plant run by Guangzhou Glass Factory, etc., was built by the staff and workers themselves, and they used manual crushing because they didn't have a stone crusher. These factories were completed in less than a month.

    自造材料　保证跃进
    武钢和大冶钢厂建立一批附属工厂
    广州市轻工业部门自办原材料工业
    据新华社讯　武汉钢铁公司充分运用大企业的优越条件，大办机械工业和建筑材料工业，生产本身建设所需要的部分设备和材料。
    现在，武钢已经以机械修理总厂和动力厂的电修车间为主，组成了一个机械网。机械总厂从去年9月份以来，已生产了一百三十台五吨的单梁吊车、三套公社号万能轧钢机、一套三十五吨平炉以及一批小转炉等成套设备。动力厂的计器车间也试制成功了电子电位差计、千分压力计、高压调节器等三种过去依靠进口的仪表。
    为了增加建筑材料的来源，武钢从去年9月起就兴建一个年产二十万吨铁、二十万吨钢和十八万吨钢材的附属钢铁厂，建设一座年产二十四万吨的水泥厂。现在，附属钢铁厂已经出钢、出铁，轧钢车间也完成了厂房和基础工程。水泥厂的烧成车间、煤粉车间、生料库、熟料库都建成了，正在建设球磨车间。这些厂投入生产后，武钢基本建设所需要的高标号水泥和小型钢材，就可以自行解决一部分。此外，各工程公司现在也办起了五、六个小水泥厂，能生产一些普通水泥，满足一般工程的部分需要。
    本报武汉5日电　大冶钢厂积极举办卫星工厂，力争自己解决一部分辅助材料和备件的供应问题，保证今年生产更多更好的钢。
    大冶钢厂过去不生产辅助材料
  （如耐火材料、铁合金等），全靠外地供应。有时候供应得不够及时。为了保证今年更大跃进，这个厂在力争外援的同时，决定举办卫星工厂。现在，这个厂已经办起一座年产万吨的铁合金车间，可以生产矽铁、锰铁、锰矽合金等二十多种铁合金；办起一座炉衬车间，专门用白云石制做碱性转炉的炉衬。这两座车间已经相继投入生产，对保证钢的质量和炼好特殊钢有重大作用。他们还正在建设一座耐火材料厂，首先要建起七座年产四万吨的土窑，生产当前急需的某些耐火砖；然后再建几座年产六万吨的大洋窑，力争耐火材料逐步基本自给。
    在加强备件制造力量方面，这个厂一面扩大机械部的铸造力量，一面发动各单位自办小卫星工厂，自己制造简易机床。例如，轧钢部、机械部的职工群众已经办起两个小翻砂厂，月产铸件四十多吨。
    本报广州5日电　广州市轻工业部门用自办原材料工业的方法，解决部分工厂原材料不足的问题，保证今年轻工业生产比去年有更大的进跃。
    从去年9月到目前为止，电池、玻璃、肥皂、胶鞋、造纸、火柴等行业的工厂，已经办了许多原材料工厂，有力地促进了生产的发展。如电池行业炭精棒供应不足，兴华和羊城电池厂等从去年9月份起，办了八个烧炭精棒的炉子。每炉一月的产量约十吨，可以满足部分需要。今年广州市洗衣肥皂的产量要达到一万一千吨，比去年增长一倍，但是制肥皂必需的硬化油一时供应不上那么多。现在，有关部门已经在广州市轻工业学校内兴建了一座硬化油厂，第一季度就可以建成，年产量达数千吨，大部分肥皂的原料将可自给。轻工业部门正在办一个合成橡胶厂，2月底便可以建成，年产达二十吨。今年还将兴建几十个这样的厂，以便扩大胶鞋生产。此外，广州市轻工业部门最近还要办烧碱、盐酸、硝酸等多种原材料工业。
    广州轻工业部门自办原材料工业的过程中，贯彻了土法为主、综合利用的原则。这些工厂都具有投资少、收效快的特点。广州玻璃厂等办的耐火材料厂，由职工自己动手建窑，没有碎石机，就用手工破碎。这些厂不到一个月便建成了。
