Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 24th: At a meeting of the Disarmament Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 23rd, Robertson, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, rabidly slandered China and insisted on pursuing a policy of aggression and threats of war in the Far East.

Robertson smeared China's consistently implemented peaceful foreign policy as a "tough and aggressive foreign policy," and, inverting black and white, said that China was conducting "military threats" and "economic threats" against other countries in the Far East, and was "single-mindedly seeking to control" the entire Asian region. But not only was Robertson unable to provide any basis for this nonsense, but he then inadvertently admitted that it was none other than the United States itself that was carrying out aggression and military threats in the Far East and "single-mindedly seeking to control" the entire Asia. Robertson indicated that the reason he made those slanders against China was that he was afraid that China would "weaken and ultimately eliminate the U.S. military forces in the Far East."

Under the guise of the so-called Chinese "threat," Robertson clamored that "vigilance" could not be "relaxed." The "main methods" he mentioned for "dealing" with China included so-called "maintaining a sufficiently strong U.S. military position," "continuing to strengthen the military, political, and economic forces of the free Far East as soon as possible," and continuing to pursue a policy of "non-recognition" that dreamed of "preventing the development" of People's China's "strength and influence." He even used atomic weapons to intimidate the Chinese people. He said that South Korea, the Kuomintang group, and South Vietnam wanted the United States to use atomic weapons to protect them.

Regarding the Taiwan Strait issue, Robertson repeated the old tune of the United States, stubbornly describing the sacred will of the Chinese people to liberate their own territory of Taiwan as "seizing" Taiwan, and clamored that there should be no "appeasement," insisting on continuing to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating their own territory.

Regarding the disarmament issue, Robertson said that the U.S. government opposed allowing China to participate in the separate negotiations on the issue of stopping nuclear tests and preventing surprise attacks held in Geneva, but "if it is possible to establish a sound and feasible system to supervise armaments or nuclear tests or surprise attacks," he "certainly believes that Communist China should be included." However, he indicated that the U.S. government had no interest in disarmament and did not believe that the negotiations in Geneva would eventually reach an agreement.

### 想用颠倒黑白的手法掩饰美国侵略面目  罗伯逊又对我国大肆污蔑

    想用颠倒黑白的手法掩饰美国侵略面目
    罗伯逊又对我国大肆污蔑
    新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊23日在参议院外交委员会裁军小组委员会会议上作证时疯狂地诽谤中国，并坚持在远东实行侵略和战争威胁政策。
    罗伯逊诬蔑中国坚持不渝地执行的和平外交政策是“强硬的侵略性的对外政策”，颠倒黑白地说什么中国对远东其他国家进行“军事威胁”和“经济威胁”，“一心想控制”整个亚洲地区。但罗伯逊不但不可能为他这一片胡言提出任何根据，而且他接着就不打自招的承认，在远东进行侵略和军事威胁以及“一心想控制”整个亚洲的不是别人，而正是美国自己。罗伯逊表明，他对中国发出那些诬蔑的原因是害怕中国要“削弱和最后消灭美国在远东的军事力量”。
    罗伯逊在所谓中国“威胁”的幌子下叫喊不能“放松戒备”。他提到的“对付”中国的“主要办法”包括所谓“保持美国的足够有力的军事地位”、“尽快继续加强自由远东的军事、政治和经济力量”，以及继续推行梦想“阻止”人民中国的“力量和影响的发展”的“不承认”政策。他甚至还拿原子武器来恫吓中国人民。他说，南朝鲜、国民党集团、南越要美国使用原子武器来保护他们。
    谈到台湾海峡问题，罗伯逊重弹美国的滥调，硬把中国人民解放自己领土台湾的神圣意志说成是“夺取”台湾，并且叫嚷不要“姑息”，坚持继续阻挠中国人民解放自己的领土。
    关于裁军问题，罗伯逊说，美国政府反对让中国参加在日内瓦分别举行的关于停止核试验问题和防止突袭问题的谈判，但是“如果有可能建立一种健全的、可行的制度来监督军备或者核试验或者突袭”，他“当然认为应该把共产党中国包括进去”。不过他表明，美国政府对裁军并无兴趣，他并不认为日内瓦的谈判最后会取得协议。
