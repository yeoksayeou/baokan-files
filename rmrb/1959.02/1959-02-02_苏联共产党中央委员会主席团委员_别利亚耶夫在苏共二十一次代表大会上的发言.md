Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st dispatch from TASS: Comrade Belyayev, Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, spoke at the 21st Congress of the CPSU on January 28.

He said that every congress of our great Leninist party is a historically significant milestone in the life of the people, a signpost at each new stage in the struggle for the happiness of the working people and for the further prosperity of the socialist motherland. The 21st Extraordinary Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which is being held this time, is such a huge and truly historic event, and the people call this congress the congress of builders of communism.

Comrade Belyayev continued, the three years since the 20th Congress of the CPSU have proved that our party and our Central Committee have carried out enormous and fruitful work in implementing the resolutions of that congress.

The restoration of the Leninist principle of collective leadership and the norms of party life has raised the enthusiasm of communists and all working people to an unprecedented height. This is a system of developing productive forces at an unprecedented speed.

Based on the instructions of the congress on the need to further develop the Leninist principle of democratic centralism in the management of the national economy, and on the initiative of the Central Committee of the CPSU, our country carried out a fundamental reorganization of the management of industry and construction. This measure has fully proved its correctness. Managing industry and construction through local national economic committees has produced invaluable and positive results in improving and improving production. Our country's industry has greatly increased the quantity and quality of its products.

As has been mentioned at the conference, the measures taken by the Central Committee of the CPSU in further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations played an enormous role. I would like to emphasize once again that the reorganization of machine tractor stations and the resale of agricultural machinery to collective farms is a huge revolutionary measure, the significance of which is inestimable.

Comrade Belyayev then pointed out that the June 1957 plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPSU was of historic significance. This plenary session smashed the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin and Shepilov, who opposed the party line formulated by the 20th Party Congress, attempted to revise the resolutions of the congress, and obstructed the implementation of these measures, which were of vital importance to the country. The whole party and all the Soviet people condemned the sinister activities of the factionalists. The Communist Party purged the anti-Party group and more firmly united its ranks under the great banner of Marxism-Leninism.

When talking about the nationwide discussion of the draft report prepared by Comrade Khrushchev for the 21st Congress of the CPSU, Comrade Belyayev pointed out that all the working people of the Kazakh Republic expressed their love for the party and the motherland, and expressed their determination to victoriously realize the magnificent Seven-Year Plan. They put forward a large number of suggestions and hopes, which came from their concern for the rapid improvement of the economy and culture of the republic and the entire Soviet Union.

The speaker said that under the leadership of the Communist Party, with the help of the great Russian people and the people of other ethnic groups in our country, the Kazakh people have achieved brilliant achievements in all aspects of life. The republic's industrial output has increased forty-two times compared to 1913. In recent years, the republic has reclaimed more than 20 million hectares of virgin and fallow land, making the republic the country's largest granary in terms of commodity grain production, second only to the Russian Federation.

The achievements of Soviet Kazakhstan and the Central Asian republics in developing the economy and culture are remarkable. In this case, the slanderous fabrications about the Soviet "Central Asia" in the French reactionary publication "Prospects" weekly appear both pathetic and shameful.

In this regard, Comrade Belyayev cited the following powerful facts. The level of industrial production in the Kazakh Republic far exceeds that of many European bourgeois countries, not to mention countries like Turkey. Kazakhstan has two-thirds less population than Turkey, but produces half as much steel, three times as much electricity, and four times as much coal. Pakistan has nine times more people than the Kazakh Republic, but only one twenty-third of Kazakhstan's steel production, one twentieth of electricity production, and one fifty-fourth of coal production.

Comrade Belyayev pointed out that the Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union in 1959-1965 fully takes into account the interests of the people of all brotherly republics. Comrade Belyayev described the vigorous development of the national economy of Kazakhstan in the next seven years.

The total industrial output of the Republic will increase by 1.7 times. The industrial output in 1965 will increase to 100 times that of 1913. The total amount of basic investment will be 116 billion to 119 billion rubles. This is approximately 1.3 times more than in the previous seven years. The total output of ferrous metallurgy products will increase by 8.6 times in seven years, and the mining of iron ore will increase by 5.3 times. Non-ferrous metallurgy will be further developed. Its total output will increase more than doubled. The total output of the chemical industry will increase threefold. Coal production will reach 50 million tons per year. 4.4 million kilowatts of power generation capacity will be put into production in seven years. A large amount of funding will be allocated to the machinery manufacturing industry, and the production of building materials will be further developed. Kazakhstan will also become the most important area for building light industry and food industry enterprises.

Comrade Belyayev then pointed out that the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan stipulate the continued rapid development of agriculture in the Kazakh Republic. It is stipulated that by the end of the seven years, the total annual grain harvest of the Republic should be no less than 1.37 billion poods. However, agricultural workers in Kazakhstan have launched a socialist competition to strive to increase the total grain harvest to at least 1.5 billion poods this year and in the coming years of the Seven-Year Plan.

Animal husbandry in the republic will be vigorously developed. The number of livestock will be drastically increased, and the productivity of livestock will be improved. Comrade Belyayev said that the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan believes that it is possible to increase meat production to 1.251 million tons (slaughter weight) by 1963, that is to say, the Kazakh party organization will complete the task put forward by the Central Committee of the CPSU ahead of schedule.

Comrade Belyayev finally said that like all the Soviet people, the working people of Kazakhstan will follow the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, unite closely around the Communist Party, move forward bravely and confidently, work tirelessly, and make due contributions to the great cause of building communism in our country.

    苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员
    别利亚耶夫在苏共二十一次代表大会上的发言
    新华社1日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员、哈萨克共产党中央委员会第一书记别利亚耶夫同志1月28日在苏共第二十一次代表大会上发了言。
    他说，我们伟大的列宁主义党的每一次代表大会都是人民生活中具有历史意义的里程碑，是在争取劳动人民幸福、争取社会主义祖国进一步繁荣的斗争中每个新阶段的路标。这次举行的苏联共产党第二十一次非常代表大会就是这种巨大的、真正具有历史意义的事件，人民把这次代表大会称为共产主义建设者的代表大会。
    别利亚耶夫同志继续说，苏共第二十次代表大会以后的三年，证明我党和我党中央委员会在实现那次代表大会决议方面进行了巨大而富有成效的工作。
    集体领导的列宁主义原则和党的生活准则的恢复，把共产党员和全体劳动人民的积极性提到了空前未有的高度，这是以空前速度发展生产力的系统。
    在代表大会关于必须在国民经济管理中进一步发展民主集中制这一列宁主义原则的指示的基础上，根据苏共中央的倡议，我国对工业和建筑业的管理进行了根本的改组。这个措施完全证明了它的正确性。通过地方国民经济委员会来管理工业和建筑业，对提高和改善生产产生了难以估价的良好结果。我国工业大大地提高了产品的数量和质量。
    代表大会上已经有人谈到，苏共中央在进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站方面的措施起了多么巨大的作用。我想再一次强调指出，改组机器拖拉机站和把农业机器转卖给集体农庄，这是一个巨大的革命性措施，它的意义是难以估价的。
    别利亚耶夫同志接着指出，1957年苏共中央六月全会具有历史性意义，这次全会粉碎了马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团，这些人反对第二十次党代表大会所制定的党的路线，企图修正代表大会的决议，阻挠这些对国家具有十分重要意义的措施的实现。全党和全体苏联人民都谴责派别分子的罪恶活动。共产党清除了反党集团，更加巩固地把自己的队伍团结在马克思列宁主义的伟大旗帜下。
    在谈到全民讨论赫鲁晓夫同志为苏共第二十一次代表大会准备的报告提纲时，别利亚耶夫同志指出，哈萨克共和国全体劳动人民表示了他们对党和祖国的热爱，并且表示了他们要胜利实现宏伟的七年计划的决心。他们提出了大量建议和希望，这些建议和希望是出自他们对迅速提高共和国和全苏联经济和文化的关心。
    发言人说，哈萨克人民在共产党的领导下，依靠伟大的俄罗斯人民以及我国其他各族人民的帮助，在生活各方面取得了辉煌的成就。共和国的工业产量比1913年增加了四十二倍。最近几年来，共和国开垦了二千万公顷以上的生荒地和熟荒地，使共和国在商品粮食生产方面，变成了仅次于俄罗斯联邦的全国最大的谷仓。
    苏维埃哈萨克和中亚细亚各共和国在发展经济和文化方面的成就是显著的。在这种情况下，法国反动刊物“展望”周刊关于苏联“中亚细亚”的诽谤性捏造显得又可怜又可耻。
    在这方面，别利亚耶夫同志举出了如下几个有力的事实。哈萨克共和国的工业生产水平远远超过了欧洲许多资产阶级国家，更不用说像土耳其这样的国家了。哈萨克的人口比土耳其少三分之二，但钢产量比土耳其多一半，发电量比土耳其多三倍，采煤量比土耳其多四倍。巴基斯坦的人口比哈萨克共和国多九倍，但是钢产量只有哈萨克的二十三分之一，发电量只有哈萨克的二十分之一，采煤量只有哈萨克的五十四分之一。
    别利亚耶夫同志指出，在1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的七年计划中全面考虑到各兄弟共和国人民的利益。别利亚耶夫同志叙述了今后七年内哈萨克国民经济的蓬勃发展。
    共和国工业总产量将增加一点七倍。1965年的工业产量将增加为1913年的一百倍。基本投资总额将为一千一百六十亿到一千一百九十亿卢布。这比前七年大约增加一点三倍。黑色冶金业产品的总产量七年中将增加八点六倍，铁矿砂的开采量将增加五点三倍。有色冶金业将进一步发展。它的总产量将增加一倍以上。化学工业总产量将增加三倍。采煤量将达到年产五千万吨。七年中将有四百四十万瓩的发电能力投入生产。将给机器制造业拨出大量经费，并且进一步发展建筑材料的生产。哈萨克还将成为建设轻工业和食品工业企业的最重要地区。
    别利亚耶夫同志接着指出，七年计划控制数字规定继续迅速发展哈萨克共和国的农业。规定在七年结束时，共和国每年谷物总收获量要不少于十三亿七千万普特。但是哈萨克的农业劳动者展开了社会主义竞赛，争取在今年和七年计划中的今后几年把谷物总收获量至少提高到十五亿普特。
    将大力发展共和国的畜牧业。急剧增加牲畜的头数，提高牲畜的产品生产率。别利亚耶夫同志说，哈萨克共产党中央全会认为在1963年就把肉类的产量增加到一百二十五万一千吨（按屠宰重）是可能的，也就是说，哈萨克党组织将提前完成苏共中央提出的任务。
    别利亚耶夫同志最后说，哈萨克劳动人民像全体苏联人民一样，将遵循着苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议，紧紧团结在共产党的周围，勇敢而充满信心地前进，将不懈地工作，对我国建设共产主义的伟大事业作出应有的贡献。（附图片）
