Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. According to the Soviet "Pravda", Suslov, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, delivered a speech at the morning session of the 21st Congress of the CPSU on January 30. The full text is as follows: Comrades!

The 21st Congress is not a regular congress of our party, so the congress did not hear a summary report from the Central Committee. But in fact, Comrade Khrushchev’s clear, comprehensive, and profound report has already summarized the work of the Party and the entire Soviet people during the period from the 20th to the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Only three years have passed since the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which is not a long period. However, during this period, we have achieved victories of worldwide historical significance.

Socialist industry has developed to a higher level, and now it is fulfilling and overfulfilling the state's industrial plan more balancedly than ever before.

Our agriculture, which has long been seriously backward, is developing and advancing with increasing speed and confidence.

In the past few years, the material welfare of the working people has been greatly improved.

The glorious achievements of Soviet culture, science, and technology have been recognized by the whole world. The first artificial earth satellites and the first artificial solar satellite are the culmination of these achievements. The Soviet artificial earth satellites and solar satellites are the natural and regular companions of our achievements, the companions of socialism that has achieved complete and thorough victory in our country. (Applause)

All these achievements are due to the great superiority of the socialist system, the extremely correct Leninist policy of our party, and the truly great creative labor of the Soviet people. These achievements mark the victory of Marxist-Leninist theory and the brilliant victory of the immortal scientific communist ideology.

New and exciting historical prospects have been opened up before the Soviet state. "The Soviet people, united around the Communist Party, have reached such heights and realized such great transformations that it has made it possible for our country to enter a new and extremely important period of development - the period of comprehensive construction of a communist society."

These few simple words in Comrade Khrushchev’s draft report on the "Control Figures for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union in 1959-1965" summarize the entire history of the Soviet state and provide a scientific summary of the upcoming new stage in the development towards communism.
	The Seven-Year Plan is formulated on the basis of Marxist-Leninist science
	What is planned today will become reality tomorrow

If we carefully consider the control figures for the development of the national economy, then a truly remarkable and almost fantastic picture unfolds before us. Such a grand plan has never existed in human history. In fact, in seven years, the industrial products produced by the Soviet Union will be equal to the industrial products produced in the entire period since the establishment of the Soviet regime, that is, forty-one years. Would anyone not be amazed by such figures?

During the discussion of Comrade Khrushchev’s draft report on the control figures for the Seven-Year Plan, the entire Soviet people unanimously and warmly supported the draft report, considering it a great program for communist construction. The Seven-Year Plan made all friends of socialism feel deeply happy and inspired. They saw the ideals they had dreamed of day and night embodied in this draft. At the same time, the Seven-Year Plan also caused great unease to the capitalist world, especially the millionaires in the United States. If they had previously held skeptical attitudes towards our people's intention to catch up with and surpass the United States in the output of extremely important industrial and agricultural products, then now they are very worried about this prospect.

The Soviet Union's several five-year plans, the world-historical achievements our country has made in implementing these five-year plans, the Soviet Union's earth satellites and solar satellites, and many other things have now convinced even the most stubborn enemies of socialism: In the Soviet Union, what is planned today will become reality tomorrow. (Applause)

Our Seven-Year Plan is very realistic, and as Comrade Khrushchev said, it is a plan that can undoubtedly be completed without excessive strain. This plan is formulated on a profound Marxist-Leninist scientific basis, on the basis of understanding the development of socialism and the regularity of socialism developing into communism. The high level of development of productive forces and the high level of scientific and technological development that the Soviet state has reached make it possible to propose and solve the great tasks in the plan. A large number of experts and skilled workers who can solve any task have been established in the country. The Soviet Union has a large amount of natural wealth, which is increasingly being discovered on a large scale to serve the people. The workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals of our country have reached unprecedented spiritual and political unity, and the peoples of all nationalities in the Soviet Union have unwavering friendship. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, they are full of determination to move towards communism. All this is a reliable guarantee that the great work plan formulated by the Party will be completed and overfulfilled.

Comrades! Comrade Khrushchev's draft report and his report not only put forward a great program for the actual work of the Party and the entire Soviet people, but also, on the basis of summarizing extremely rich practice, scientifically clarified our future path and developed a series of important principles of Marxism-Leninism on the transition from socialism to communism.
	Building communism has become the direct task of the Soviet Union
	The implementation of the Seven-Year Plan will see the basic characteristics of communism

The characteristic of the new and extremely important period of development in our country inaugurated by the 21st Congress of the Party—the period of comprehensively launching the construction of a communist society—is fully in line with the Marxist-Leninist classics' doctrine on the transition from socialism to communism.

Marx and Lenin taught that communism does not appear suddenly, it has a process of generation, maturation, and development, and goes through certain periods and stages in its development. After the overthrow of capitalism comes the first stage of the new society—socialism, and then, in the more or less long process of maturation of this new society, mature and perfect communist structures are formed.

These two stages, namely socialism and communism, have a decisive commonality, that is, in each stage, the means of production are publicly owned, and the purpose of production is to systematically improve the material and cultural living standards of the people by relying on the continuous improvement and perfection of technology. Everyone knows that the difference between the two lies primarily in the following: Under socialism, the production and distribution of products are realized according to the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to the amount and quality of labor expended," while under communism, another principle is implemented, namely, "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." This difference is determined by the difference in the level of development of productive forces. Communism requires such a high level of development of productive forces and labor productivity that it can guarantee the creation of abundant material resources.

Therefore, there is no insurmountable boundary between the lower and higher stages of communist society. Socialism is gradually growing into communism.

Socialism in our country has reached such a degree of maturity, its superiority has been brought into play with such great force and on such a large scale, that building communism has now become the direct task of our entire society.

From the quantitative indicators of the Seven-Year Plan, from its figures, it is not difficult to see the qualitative characteristics of the new period of communist construction.

In the next seven years, a decisive step will be taken in establishing the material and technical foundation of communism, ensuring the vigorous development of productive forces and improving the social labor productivity of various sectors of the national economy, and ensuring the further strengthening of the country's economic strength and national defense capabilities. The material welfare of the working people will be greatly improved, that is: increasing workers' wages and collective farmers' income, increasing preferential treatment funds, shortening working days again, fully meeting residents' needs for food, clothing, shoes, and other commodities, greatly improving housing conditions, and so on.

The new period of development of Soviet society will be marked by the gradual convergence of the two forms of socialist ownership—the form of state ownership and the form of collective farm ownership. On this basis, as well as on the basis of further great improvement in technology and improvement in the social, spiritual, and cultural levels, great achievements will also be made on the road to overcoming the essential differences between mental and physical labor and eliminating the class boundaries between workers and farmers. The process of these social changes will be long-term, and of course cannot be completed within the seven-year period. Before the essential class differences are eliminated, the most advanced social class—the working class—will continue to play a leading role in the country.

In addition to the grand program in material production, the Seven-Year Plan also stipulates huge tasks in improving the spiritual culture of Soviet society and educating all working people in the spirit of high communist principles.

The Seven-Year Plan will make all the basic material and spiritual characteristics of the future communist society clear, realistic, and tangible.

Major changes have taken place in our country's ideological life in the period since the 20th Congress of the Party. The resolutions of the 20th Congress and the work done by the Party in all aspects have played an important role in this regard. During this period, our Party boldly raised and solved many new issues in the development of economy and culture, resolutely abandoned everything outdated and stale, and carried out a struggle against revisionism, dogmatism, and scholasticism. All this has provided a creative environment for the country and promoted the upsurge of ideological life.

	The entire ideological and theoretical work should be raised to a new stage
	Strive to theoretically summarize the rich practical experience

Now, the second edition of the Collected Works of Marx and Engels has been published. The Complete Works of Lenin, records and stenographic records of the Party's previous congresses and conferences are being published, and textbooks and special articles on Marxist-Leninist theoretical issues are also being published one after another. The work of elaborating the history of the CPSU is extremely active. The work of criticizing modern reactionary bourgeois ideological systems and the ideological basis of revisionism has been improved.

However, it should be pointed out that there are still many shortcomings in our ideological work. The phenomenon of ideological work being divorced from the practice of communist construction has not been completely overcome. Some theoretical and propaganda cadres spend their energy on problems that are very divorced from life. Their "works" are only valuable to those authors who take advantage of the negligence and liberalism of some of our publishers to obtain royalties.

It must also be admitted that the work of struggling against all kinds of capitalist remnants and the influence of bourgeois ideology in people's minds is obviously still very inadequate.

We must raise our entire ideological work to a level that can meet the huge tasks put forward by our Party. Now, as we are advancing along a road that no one has ever traveled before and towards an unknown communist construction road, it is especially necessary to raise the theoretical work of social sciences, first of all, the issues related to the transition from socialism to communism, as well as the issues of modern imperialism, the workers' movement in capitalist countries, and the issues of national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, to a new stage. Bold creation based on the theoretical summary of rich practical experience is particularly necessary now.

One of the issues arising from the practice of communist construction is how, under socialist conditions, during the period of comprehensively launching communist construction, to realize the law determined by Marxism that the productive forces and the relations of production must be adapted to each other, and how to overcome the phenomenon of the inadequacy of this or that aspect of the productive forces and the relations of production arising in this construction process.

The law that the relations of production adapt to the level of development of productive forces is the objective basis of our Party's economic policy. Only under this adaptation can economic forms most effectively promote the development of productive forces.

In socialist society, the law that the relations of production adapt to the level of development of productive forces is not realized spontaneously and self-flowingly, but through planned and purposeful activities carried out by the people under the leadership of the Party. The Party and the Soviet state, while exposing the contradictions between the increased productive forces and this or that outdated aspect of the relations of production, fully consciously implement measures aimed at improving the relations of production and adapting the relations of production to the productive forces. It is precisely in this way and for this purpose that the Party and the state organized the necessary changes in the ownership of the means of production, reorganized the machine tractor stations, and sold their technical equipment to the collective farms.

The Party and its Central Committee have found a new road for the convergence of the two forms of socialist ownership—the state form and the cooperative-collective farm form. Collective farms buying tractors, combine harvesters, and other agricultural technical equipment from the state, expanding and qualitatively changing their existing public accumulation funds, create conditions for the gradual transformation of collective ownership into ownership by the whole people. Collective farms possessing their own modern agricultural technical equipment can also serve as a material basis for transforming agricultural labor into industrial labor. The process of further convergence of cooperative-collective farm ownership with ownership by the whole people can also be realized through some progressive phenomena in recent years, such as collective farms jointly running power stations, irrigation systems, industrial enterprises, hospitals, schools, clubs, etc., on a very large scale.

The Party and the Soviet government reorganized the planning and management of industry and construction. Everyone knows that fundamental reforms have also been implemented in the relations of distribution and exchange: we have transitioned from the tax system and the compulsory sales system of agricultural products to the purchase system and changed the purchase prices of these products, and so on.

Studying the issue of labor remuneration in the communist period and how to combine the material and spiritual incentives of social production has important theoretical and practical significance. It is of great significance to study such issues as: the transition of labor remuneration of collective farm members to monetary remuneration in collective farms, making the labor remuneration system in collective farms gradually approach the wage system adopted in state-owned enterprises, and this convergence of the two labor remuneration systems will affect the gradual disappearance of the differences between the working class and collective farmers.

	The Soviets will play a prominent role in communist construction
	A portion of the functions of state organs will gradually be transferred to social organizations

It is of particular importance to theoretically elaborate on the role of the socialist state during the period of comprehensively launching communist construction. Extremely important principles on this issue have been formulated in Comrade Khrushchev's report.

Our Soviets are the political foundation of the Soviet state and are the all-encompassing organizations of the working people. Our Soviets represent 134 million voters, that is, practically all adult residents in the country. More than 1.5 million people have been elected as representatives of the Soviets. More than 2.5 million workers participate in the work of the standing committees of the Soviets. The Soviets of the working people guarantee the actual participation of the whole people in the management of the country, giving the working people actual rights and freedoms that do not and cannot exist even in the most perfect democratic bourgeois republic. When Lenin described the Soviets from the point of view of the connection between the Soviets and the broadest masses of working people and from the point of view of developing the democracy of the vast majority of residents, he said: "Humanity has not yet created a government higher and better than the Soviets of Workers, Farm Laborers, Peasants, and Soldiers Representatives..." (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian Edition, Fourth Edition, Volume 24, Page 21, Chinese Edition, Volume 24, Page 20).

With the development of Soviet society, the functions of our country naturally change and develop. The main functions of the socialist state at the present stage lie in economic-organizational work and cultural-educational work, in supervising the amount of labor and consumption, and in maintaining socialist ownership and the socialist legal system. Our country still maintains the function of defending the motherland from military attacks by imperialist countries. The state's function in organizing cooperation, mutual assistance, and exchange of experience with socialist countries is developing day by day.

With the development of Soviet society, the working methods of state organs are also changing, and the work of organizing and persuading the masses has greater and greater significance. Coercion has never been the main working method of the socialist state; now, the scope of coercion is increasingly shrinking, and its main focus is on spies sent by imperialist countries, as well as thieves and swindlers, people who steal social wealth, parasites, vicious hooligans, murderers, and other anti-social elements.

Undoubtedly, the Soviets will play an outstanding role in completing the Seven-Year Plan and in the transition of Soviet society from socialism to communism. The entry of the Soviet Union into the period of comprehensively launching communist construction requires improving the socialist state organization and further developing Soviet democracy, enhancing the enthusiasm and initiative of the working people, and further strengthening the worker-peasant alliance and the friendship of all nationalities in our country.

In the new stage of communist construction, a large part of the functions of state organs will gradually be transferred to social organizations. Trade unions, the Communist Youth League, cooperatives, and other mass organizations—sports associations, science and technology associations, education associations, literary and artistic creation associations, etc., these organizations that unite tens of millions of Soviet people reflect the profound democratic nature of the socialist system and bring into play the initiative and creativity of the people. The role and significance of these organizations will continue to grow. As of now, many functions that were previously exercised by state organs are being performed by trade unions.

The Communist Youth League is increasingly involved in solving the education problems of the growing generation and participating in all aspects of political and economic life.

However, the growing role of social organizations will never lead to a shrinking of the role of political or economic institutions in the period of transition from socialism to communism, or the great role of the Soviets of Working People's Deputies. The revisionist leadership group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia attempted to belittle the role of the state and state institutions, thereby ideologically disarming the working class in the struggle for the victory of socialism. Therefore, the views of this revisionist leadership group are theoretically untenable and harmful in practice. Marxist-Leninist theory and historical experience affirm that after the victory of the socialist revolution, not only must the state be preserved under the socialist system, but also under certain historical conditions, even under the communist system, the state must be preserved, if capitalist countries and the capitalist camp still exist and therefore the danger of imperialists attacking our country and other socialist countries has not been eliminated.

	The higher the consciousness of the masses, the smoother the solution of construction tasks
	Art should reflect the noble spiritual outlook of the Soviet people

Comrades! To realize the grand plan of building communism, it is necessary to further enhance the communist consciousness of the broad masses of working people and strengthen the Marxist-Leninist education of all Soviet people. The higher the consciousness of the masses, the smoother the solution of economic and cultural construction tasks will be.

Our Party has done a lot of work in conducting communist education for the Soviet people, and has achieved good results. The Soviet people are the creators of a powerful socialist industry, the creators of an excellent collective farm system, and the creators of thriving science, culture, and art.

However, we should not be complacent with the achievements we have already made. We know that in Soviet society, there are still many remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness. These remnants are primarily manifested in: some citizens still have the psychology and morality of private ownership, adopt a dishonest attitude towards labor and socialist property, have incorrect attitudes towards women, and engage in alcoholism, hooliganism, and disrespect for the norms of socialist public life. The reason why these remnants of the past can stubbornly exist in the minds of the Soviet people is that consciousness lags behind social life, and because alien views and bourgeois ideology from the capitalist world intrude into our people.

This means that it is necessary to strengthen attention to the task of conducting communist education for the working people and cultivating in them the noble moral qualities of the people of the communist era, such as loyalty to the cause of communism, love for the socialist motherland, proletarian internationalism and the spirit of friendship towards the people of all countries, hatred for the enemies of socialism, collectivism, active participation in social labor, and an irreconcilable attitude towards those who disrupt social order.

Special attention should be paid to cultivating people's communist attitude towards labor and socialist property. The attitude towards labor, this cause of social and national significance, this glorious cause, constantly improving labor productivity, and cherishing socialist property are the most important signs of the Soviet people's level of consciousness, their noble spiritual outlook, and their loyalty to the cause of communism. Despising labor and living a parasitic life is an anti-social phenomenon, and under the socialist system, where the phenomenon of exploitation of man by man has been eliminated and labor has become labor for oneself, for one's own happiness, for the welfare of all people, and for the benefit of socialist society, it is an anti-people phenomenon. In our society, there should be no place for parasites and idlers.

When we talk about conducting communist education for the working people, naturally, this does not only refer to various forms of education and propaganda, but mainly refers to revolutionary practice, attracting all working people without exception to actively participate in social production and participate in solving all the practical tasks of communist construction. The boiling life of our socialist society is the best school, the best teacher, and the best crucible for cultivating the character of the Soviet people.

Correctly implementing the law on strengthening the connection between schools and life and further developing the Soviet national education system is of great significance for educating the growing generation to have a communist attitude towards labor. Schools should ensure the all-round development of young people, educate them in the spirit of communism, and prepare them practically to participate in the productive labor of various sectors of the national economy.

In the great work of communist education, it is necessary to fully utilize the various means at our Party's disposal. Among them, newspapers and periodicals, literature, and art occupy a prominent position.

The direction and content of our art, where art leads people, and how it helps to cultivate people's character have always been objects of special concern to our Party. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Central Committee of the CPSU met and talked with writers, artists, and composers more than once, and extensively discussed some fundamental issues in the development of our country's art. These meetings played a major role in uniting writers and artists on a principled basis, in strengthening their connection with life, and in making them pay attention to modern problems and the themes of current Soviet reality.

Writers and artists correctly understood the tasks put forward by the Party, and they actively participated in the struggle against various forms of revisionist phenomena, and they became more closely united around the Communist Party. This had an extremely positive impact on the results of their creative labor. Many literary and artistic works created recently have raised important issues in our reality, and these works have been appreciated by society. The protagonists of these works are all advanced figures of the times, creators of new life, and builders of communism. Creative workers strive to write the profound changes and new outstanding processes that have taken place in the lives of the Soviet people in recent years into their works, and this ambition deserves strong support.

The Party cherishes and fully supports these achievements of our art workers, because they reflect the universal upsurge in all fields of material and spiritual life, and reflect the upsurge of people's initiative and creativity. But at the same time, we cannot close our eyes to the serious shortcomings in literature and art. Our creative workers still need to do a lot of work to make literature and art fully fulfill their lofty social mission—to inspire the people to fight for communism.

What conditions are needed to make Soviet literature and art reach a level that can adapt to its tasks?

An important condition for ensuring the development of our country's art is to carry out a resolute and irreconcilable struggle against alien ideological influences. Only when artists have a completely clear ideological position can they create works needed by the people. Precisely because of this, our enemies and their revisionist servants are working so hard to sow doubt and create blurred consciousness in the minds of the wavering elements in the ranks of art workers, thereby leading them away from the only correct path. The revisionists' offensive was repelled, and they had to retreat shamefully. However, the ideological struggle has not stopped. Our art should fight for the noble spiritual outlook of the Soviet people.

The close connection between art and people's lives, and the Communist Party's policy is a decisive condition. Many of the shortcomings of our art are primarily due to the authors of some works understanding very little about the new processes and new phenomena that constitute the essence of reality and reflect the great and unstoppable movement of our society towards communism. Truly great art always arises from a passionate and profound study of life. When a writer, an art worker, actively participates in the life of his country's people, participates in the construction of the most just and humane system—communism, he will gain truly great artistic power. As early as the 20th Congress of the CPSU, a task was put forward for literature and art—to be at the forefront of the world not only in terms of rich and diverse content, but also in terms of artistic strength and skill—now has special significance.

Now, when the role of social initiative in national life, the role of mass activism, and the initiative of the people have grown particularly, the Soviet publishing industry faces new and major tasks. This is a powerful force. Now, the circulation of newspapers alone reaches about 62 million copies, while the circulation before the 20th Congress of the CPSU was only 48.7 million copies. In addition, 858 kinds of magazines are now published, with a circulation of 26 million copies, and more than 60,000 kinds of books are published, with a circulation of more than 1.1 billion copies. The propaganda and organizational role of publishing work has grown significantly since the Party's 20th Congress. Newspapers have begun to expound the life of the Party, the work of industry and agriculture, and cultural construction more deeply and sharply. In recent years, the movement of worker and peasant correspondents has become active.

But even so, the current ideological and literary level of many newspapers and magazines is still unsatisfactory. Some newspapers are filled with dull, empty articles and communications. We have also published many unnecessary and meaningless books and magazines.

It is necessary to improve the role and prestige of publications. Now, the main task of our books, newspapers, and oral propaganda is to make all working people aware of the great significance of the political, economic, and cultural tasks of the Seven-Year Plan, the great significance of the encouraging prospects presented to the country, and mobilize and organize the talents, abilities, will, and initiative of our people to fight for communism, for the implementation of the measures formulated by the Party to further develop the national economy, and to increase the production of metals, machines, oil and coal extraction, power generation, grain, meat, milk, clothing, shoes, and housing construction.
	The CPSU Congress will open a new era in human history
	Imperialism and its followers cannot hinder the progress of history

The Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy is a straight and clear road to communism. The completion of the Seven-Year Plan will further enhance the power of the Soviet Union, further strengthen the great socialist camp, have a positive impact on the entire process of social development in the world and the fate of all mankind, more clearly demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, consolidate peace, and weaken the threat of war from imperialist countries.

The People's Republic of China and some other countries in the powerful socialist camp are advancing side by side with the Soviet Union, firmly marching towards socialism, and constantly achieving more and more exciting victories. The balance of power between the two world systems, the socialist system and the capitalist system, is undergoing a decisive change in favor of socialism. According to economists' calculations, as a result of the completion and overfulfillment of the Seven-Year Plan, and as a result of the economically victorious development of all socialist countries, the product output of socialist countries, which account for about 26% of the earth's area and about 35% of the world's population, will exceed that of all other countries in the world. This is a victory for socialism that is enough to make the entire capitalist system tremble. (Stormy applause).

The victory of the world socialist system will also help consolidate the independence of countries that were recently liberated from colonial enslavement, help the development of national liberation struggles in colonies and dependencies, and help accelerate the process of the collapse of the colonial system.

Our Seven-Year Plan and the achievements of other socialist countries will be a strong spiritual support for the workers' movement and the communist movement in capitalist countries. Since the Moscow Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties in 1957, the workers' movement and the communist movement in capitalist countries have achieved new victories in fierce struggles against the reactionaries. The unity and internationalist fraternal ties of the Communist and Workers' Parties have been strengthened on the Marxist-Leninist principles of the Moscow Meeting Declaration. The revisionists who attempted to split the socialist camp, the international workers' movement, and the communist movement, thereby serving the enemies of socialism, have been devastatingly hit.

Imperialists and their followers want to hinder the victorious advance of the peoples of all countries towards socialism. However, this attempt is bound to fail. The reactionary forces' attempt to block the path of the peoples of all countries towards democracy, socialism, and peace is tantamount to defying the forces of nature. Any persecution and terror by the terrified reactionaries, any curses from the leaders of reformism and revisionism cannot stop the progressive development of history. Capitalism is struggling desperately, trying to keep its head above water, but it is becoming increasingly difficult. Undoubtedly, the day is not far off when it will be pulled into the water by its own crimes against humanity, giving way to a truly progressive socio-political system—socialism. (Stormy applause).

Comrades! Our Communist Party is convening its 21st Congress in a united and strong situation. Between the 20th and 21st Congresses, the Party further strengthened its ties with the workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals, and it is now more loved by all the Soviet people than ever before. The Party has restored the Leninist principles of Party building, and lives and operates in an atmosphere of great creative upsurge and great activism in all its organizations.

The Party smashed and rejected the Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov anti-Party group that opposed the Leninist policies of the Central Committee and opposed the fundamental interests of the Soviet people, further united its ranks, and became an invincible and powerful fortress for all enemies of socialism and Marxism-Leninism. (Applause).

The prestige of our Party on the international stage is enormous, and the whole world is listening to its voice. It is no accident that our Congress is now the center of attention of the world's public.

Where does the main strength of our Party as the advanced and leading contingent of the Soviet people lie? It lies in the fact that it is armed with the invincible doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, it is forever loyal to this doctrine and constantly enriches this doctrine on the basis of practice.

The resolutions of the Party's 21st Congress, based on this doctrine, will open a new era in human history—the era of comprehensively launching the construction of a communist society. The Party, armed with the resolutions of the Congress, will raise the banner of Marxism-Leninism higher and guide the Soviet people towards the complete victory of communism in our country with a firm Leninist orientation.
(Stormy and prolonged applause).

    苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员
    苏斯洛夫在苏共二十一次代表大会上的发言
    新华社3日讯　据苏联“真理报”报道：苏共中央主席团委员苏斯洛夫在苏共第二十一次代表大会1月30日上午会议上发了言，全文如下：同志们！
    第二十一次代表大会并不是我们党的定期代表大会，所以代表大会没有听取中央委员会的总结报告。但是实际上，在赫鲁晓夫同志的明确的、全面而又深刻的报告中已经作了党和全体苏联人民在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会到第二十一次代表大会期间的工作总结。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会以后仅仅过了三年，这是一个不长的时期。但是，在这个时期里，我们取得了具有全世界历史意义的胜利。
    社会主义工业发展到了更高的水平，现在，它在比任何时期都要均衡地完成和超额完成着国家的工业计划。
    我们的长期严重落后的农业正在日益加快地发展并满怀信心地前进。
    在过去几年中，劳动人民的物质福利大大地提高了。
    苏维埃文化、科学和技术方面所获得的辉煌成就已为全世界所承认，头一批人造地球卫星和第一个人造太阳卫星就是这些成就的顶峰，苏联人造地球卫星和太阳卫星是我们的成就的自然和合乎规律的同路人，是在我国获得了完全和彻底胜利的社会主义的同路人。（掌声）
    所有这些成就的获得是由于社会主义制度的巨大优越性，是由于我们党的十分正确的列宁主义政策和苏联人民真正巨大的创造性劳动的结果。这些成就标志着马克思列宁主义理论的胜利，标志着不朽的科学共产主义思想的辉煌胜利。
    在苏维埃国家面前揭开了新的激动人心的历史前景。“团结在共产党周围的苏联人民达到了这样的高峰，实现了这样巨大的变革，以致使我国有可能进入一个新的、极重要的发展时期——全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期”。
    赫鲁晓夫同志所作的“1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的控制数字”的报告提纲中这几句简单的话，对苏维埃国家的全部历史作出了总结，并对即将到来的在向共产主义发展方面的全新阶段作了科学的概括。
      七年计划在马列主义科学基础上拟定
      今天订的计划在明天就将会变成现实
    如果仔细考虑一下发展国民经济的控制数字，那么在我们面前就展开了一幅十分了不起的、差不多是幻想般的图景。这样宏伟的计划是人类历史上从来没有过的。事实上，在七年中苏联生产的工业产品将等于苏维埃政权建立以来全部时期、也就是四十一年生产的工业品。难道会有谁不为这样的数字而惊讶？
    在讨论赫鲁晓夫同志关于七年计划控制数字的报告提纲时，全体苏联人民都一致热烈拥护这个报告提纲，认为这是共产主义建设的伟大纲领。七年计划使所有社会主义的朋友感到深深的高兴和鼓舞。他们看到这个提纲中体现了他们朝夕思慕的理想。同时，七年计划也使资本主义世界、首先是美国的百万富翁们感到极大的不安。如果说，从前他们对我国人民要在极重要的工业品和农业品的产量上赶上并超过美国这种意图一直抱着怀疑的态度的话，那么现在他们就对这个前景感到十分忧虑了。
    苏联的几个五年计划，我国在实现这些五年计划时所取得的具有世界历史意义的成就，苏联的地球卫星和太阳卫星以及其他许多事情，现在甚至使那些社会主义的死敌也信服了：在苏联，今天列入计划的东西，明天就将变成现实。（掌声）
    我们的七年计划是十分现实的，正如赫鲁晓夫同志所说，是一个不需要过分紧张就无疑可以完成的计划。这个计划是在深刻的马克思列宁主义科学基础上拟定的，是在认识社会主义的发展以及社会主义发展为共产主义的规律性的基础上拟定的。苏维埃国家已经达到的生产力发展的高度水平和科学技术发展的高度水平使得有可能提出和解决计划中的伟大任务。国内建立了一支人数众多的、能够解决任何任务的专家、熟练工人的干部队伍。苏联有着大量的自然财富，这些财富日益大规模地被发掘出来为人们服务。我国的工人、集体农民和知识分子在精神上和政治上达到空前未有的团结，苏联各族人民有着毫不动摇的友谊，他们在共产党的英明领导下，正充满决心要走向共产主义。所有这一切都是党所拟定的伟大的工作计划一定能完成并且超额完成的可靠保证。
    同志们！赫鲁晓夫同志的提纲中和报告中不仅提出了党和全体苏联人民的实际工作的伟大纲领，而且在总结极丰富的实践的基础上给我们科学地阐明了我们今后的道路，发展了马克思列宁主义关于从社会主义过渡到共产主义的一系列重要原理。
    建设共产主义已经成为苏联的直接任务
    实现七年计划将看见共产主义基本特征
    由党的第二十一次代表大会揭开的我国新的极重要的发展时期——全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期的特点，是同马克思列宁主义经典作家关于从社会主义向共产主义过渡的学说完全符合的。
    马克思和列宁教导说，共产主义不是突然出现的，它有产生、成熟到发展的过程，在其发展中经过一定的时期和阶段。在推翻资本主义之后到来的是新社会的第一个阶段——社会主义，然后，在这种新社会的或长或短的成熟过程中形成形式成熟而完善的共产主义结构。
    这两个阶段，即社会主义和共产主义，有着决定性的共同点，即在每个阶段中生产资料都是公有的，而生产的目的是依靠在高度的技术不断提高和改善生产的基础上有系统地提高人民的物质生活水平和文化生活水平。大家知道，这两者之间的区别首先在于下列一点：在社会主义条件下，产品的生产和分配是根据各尽所能，按所耗劳动的量和质分配的原则实现的，而在共产主义条件下实行的是另一个原则，即各尽所能，按需分配。而这种差别又是由生产力发展水平的差别而决定的。共产主义要有这样一种高度的生产力和劳动生产率发展水平，它要能保证创造丰裕的物质资料。
    因此说，在共产主义社会的低级阶段和高级阶段之间没有不可克服的界线。社会主义是逐渐成长为共产主义的。
    社会主义在我国已达到这样一种成熟的程度，它的优越性已经以如此巨大的力量和如此巨大的规模发挥出来，以致建设共产主义现在已成为我们整个社会的直接任务了。
    从七年计划的数量指标、从它的数字中不难看出新的共产主义建设时期的质的特点。
    在今后七年内，将在建立共产主义的物质技术基础方面迈出决定性的一步，将保证大力发展生产力和提高国民经济各部门的社会劳动生产率，将保证进一步加强国家的经济实力和国防力量。劳动人民的物质福利将有新的巨大的提高，即：提高工人工资和集体农民收入，提高优抚金，再次缩短工作日，充分地满足居民对食品、服装、靴鞋等等商品的需求，大大改善居住条件等等。
    苏维埃社会发展的新时期将以社会主义所有制的两种形式——国家所有制形式和集体农庄所有制形式的逐渐接近为标志。在这一基础上以及在技术进一步大大改进和社会精神文化提高的基础上，在克服脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的本质差别和消灭工人和农民之间的阶级界线的道路上也将取得很大的成就。这些社会变化的过程将是长期的，当然就不能在七年时期内完成。在本质的阶级差别消灭之前，最先进的社会阶级——工人阶级在国家中还继续起主导作用。
    除物质生产方面的宏伟纲领外，七年计划在提高苏维埃社会的精神文化和以高度共产主义原则的精神教育全体劳动人民方面也规定了巨大的任务。
    七年计划将使未来共产主义社会的一切基本物质特征和精神特征明晰可见，现实可触。
    自从党的第二十次代表大会以来的时期内，我国的思想生活发生了重大变化。第二十次代表大会的决议和党在各方面所做的工作，在这方面起了重要的作用。我们党在这期间大胆地提出和解决了发展经济和文化方面的许多新问题，坚决抛弃了一切过时和陈腐的东西，进行了反对修正主义、教条主义和学究习气的斗争。所有这一切给国家提供了创造的环境，促进了思想生活的高涨。
    整个思想理论工作应该提高到新阶段
    努力对丰富的实际经验进行理论概括
    现在，马克思恩格斯文集第二版已经问世。正在出版列宁全集、党的历次代表大会和各种会议的记录和速记稿，有关马克思列宁主义理论问题的教科书和专题论文也在陆续出版中。阐述苏共历史问题的工作极为活跃。批评现代反动的资产阶级思想体系和修正主义思想基础的工作改进了。
    但是，应当指出，我们的思想工作还存在着不少的缺点。思想工作脱离共产主义建设实践的现象还没有彻底克服。还有一些理论干部和宣传干部把他们的精力花费在十分脱离生活的问题上，他们的“著作”，只对那些利用我们的某些出版者的疏忽大意和自由主义来取得稿酬的作者有价值。
    还应当承认，同人们思想意识中形形色色的资本主义残余和资产阶级思想的影响进行斗争的工作显然还很不够。
    必须把我们的整个思想工作提高到能适应我们党提出来的巨大任务的水平。现在，当我们正在沿着从来没有人走过的道路和前所未知的共产主义建设道路前进时，特别需要把社会科学，首先是把有关社会主义向共产主义过渡的问题以及现代帝国主义的问题、资本主义国家的工人运动问题、亚非国家和拉丁美洲各国人民争取民族解放的问题的理论工作提高到一个新的阶段。以对丰富的实际经验进行理论概括为基础的大胆创造，现在显得特别必要。
    共产主义建设实践中所产生的这类问题之一是，在社会主义的条件下，在全面展开共产主义建设时期通过什么方式来实现马克思主义所确定的生产力和生产关系相适应的规律，如何克服在这个建设过程中所产生的生产力同生产关系的这个或那个方面的不适应的现象。
    生产关系适应生产力发展水平的规律是我们党的经济政策的客观基础。只有在这种适应的情况下经济形式才能最有效地促进生产力的发展。
    在社会主义社会里，生产关系适应生产力发展水平的规律不是自发地和自流地实现的，而是通过人民在党的领导下进行有计划的和目标明确的活动来实现。党和苏维埃国家在揭露业已增加的生产力同生产关系的这个或那个已经过时的方面之间的矛盾的同时，完全有意识地实行旨在改善生产关系和使生产关系适应生产力的措施。正是以这种方式和为了这种目的，党和国家组织了生产资料所有制方面的必要改变，改组了机器拖拉机站并且把它们的技术设备卖给集体农庄。
    党和它的中央委员会找到了社会主义所有制的两种形式——国家形式和合作社—集体农庄形式——接近的新道路。集体农庄向国家购买拖拉机、收割联合机和其他农业技术设备，扩大并且在质的方面改变它们现有的公积金，为集体所有制逐渐变为全民所有制创造条件。集体农庄拥有属于自己的现代农业技术设备，同时也可作为把农业劳动变为工业劳动的一种形式的物质基础。还可以通过近年来规模很大的一些进步现象，如集体农庄合办发电站、灌溉系统、工业企业、医院、学校、俱乐部等，来实现合作社—集体农庄所有制同全民所有制进一步接近的过程。
    党和苏联政府改组了工业和建筑业的计划和管理。大家都知道，在分配和交换关系方面也实行了根本的改革：我们从税收制度、从农产品的义务交售制度过渡到了收购制度并改变了这些产品的收购价格，等等。
    研究在共产主义时期的劳动报酬以及如何把社会生产的物质刺激和精神刺激结合起来的问题具有重要的理论意义和实践意义。研究下列这样一些问题是有极大意义的：在集体农庄中庄员的劳动报酬过渡到货币报酬，使集体农庄中的劳动报酬制度逐渐接近国营企业中所采用的工资制度，两种劳动报酬制度的这种接近将影响到工人阶级和集体农民之间差别的逐渐消失。
    在共产主义建设中苏维埃将起卓越作用
    国家机关一部分职能逐渐转归社会团体
    在理论上全面阐明在全面展开共产主义建设时期社会主义国家的作用的问题是有特别重要的意义的。在赫鲁晓夫同志的报告中就这个问题制定了极其重要的原理。
    我们的苏维埃是苏维埃国家的政治基础，是劳动人民的无所不包的组织。我们的苏维埃代表着一亿三千四百万选民，也就是实际上国内所有的成年居民。有一百五十多万人当选为苏维埃的代表。有二百五十多万劳动者参加了苏维埃常设委员会的工作。劳动人民代表苏维埃保证了全民实际参加国家的管理，给劳动人民以实际的权利和自由，这种权利和自由甚至在民主最完善的资产阶级共和国中都是没有过的，而且也不可能有的。列宁从苏维埃同最广大劳动群众的联系这个观点以及从发展绝大多数居民的民主这个观点描述苏维埃时说：“比工人、雇农、农民和士兵代表苏维埃更高更好的政府，人类还没有创造出来……”（列宁全集俄文本第四版第二十四卷第二十一页，中文本第二十四卷第二十页）。
    随着苏维埃社会的发展，我们国家的职能自然也在变化和发展着。社会主义国家在现阶段的主要职能在于经济—组织工作和文化教育工作，在于监督劳动量和消费量、维护社会主义所有制和社会主义法制。我们国家仍然保持着保卫祖国免受帝国主义国家军事进攻的职能。国家在组织同社会主义国家的合作、互助和交流经验方面的职能正在日益发展。
    随着苏维埃社会的发展，国家机关的工作方法也在改变，组织和说服群众的工作具有越来越大的意义。强迫从来不是社会主义国家的主要工作方法；现在，强迫的范围愈益缩小，它的主要锋芒是针对帝国主义国家派遣的特务，以及小偷和骗子手、盗窃社会财富的人、寄生虫、凶恶的流氓、凶手和其他反社会分子。
    无疑地苏维埃在完成七年计划和苏维埃社会从社会主义过渡到共产主义时期将起着卓越的作用。苏联进入全面展开共产主义建设的时期，要求改进社会主义的国家组织和进一步发展苏维埃民主、提高劳动人民的积极性和独创精神，进一步加强工农联盟和我国各族人民的友谊。
    在共产主义建设的新阶段，国家机关有很大一部分职能将逐渐转归社会团体。工会、共青团、合作社和其他群众团体——体育协会、科学技术协会、教育协会、文艺创作协会等等，这些联合了千千万万苏联人的组织反映了社会主义制度的深刻的民主性质，发挥了人民群众的主动性和独创精神。这些组织的作用和意义将会不断增长。就拿现在来说，过去由国家机关行使的许多职能正由工会来执行。
    共青团越来越多地参与解决正在成长的青年一代的教育问题和参加各方面的政治经济生活。
    但是，社会团体日益增长的作用绝不会导致缩小政治机构或经济机构在从社会主义过渡到共产主义的时期中的作用、劳动人民代表苏维埃的巨大作用。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的修正主义领导集团企图贬低国家和国家机构的作用，从而在争取社会主义胜利的斗争中在思想上解除工人阶级的武装，因此这个修正主义领导集团的观点在理论上是站不住脚的，而在实践上是有害的。马克思列宁主义的理论和历史经验肯定，在社会主义革命胜利以后，不仅在社会主义制度下要保存国家，而且在一定历史条件下，即使在共产主义制度下也要保存国家，如果资本主义国家和资本主义阵营还存在因而还没有消除帝国主义者向我国和其他社会主义国家进攻的危险的话。
    群众觉悟愈高解决建设任务也就愈顺利
    艺术应当反映苏维埃人的崇高精神面貌
    同志们！要实现建设共产主义的宏伟计划，就需要进一步提高广大劳动人民群众的共产主义觉悟，加强对全体苏联人的马克思列宁主义教育。群众的觉悟愈高，解决经济和文化建设的任务就会愈顺利。
    我们党在对苏联人民进行共产主义教育方面作了许多工作，而且获得了良好的成果。苏联人是强大的社会主义工业的创造者，是出色的集体农庄制度的创造者，是欣欣向荣的科学、文化和艺术的创造者。
    但是，我们不应该陶醉于已获得的成就。我们知道，在苏维埃社会中，在人的意识中还有不少资本主义残余。这些残余首先表现在：一部分公民还有私有制度的心理和道德，对劳动和社会主义财产采取不老实态度，对待妇女的态度不正确，酗酒、流氓作风和不尊重社会主义公共生活准则。过去的这些残余之所以能在苏联人的思想意识中顽强地存在，这是由于意识落后于社会生活，由于来自资本主义世界的异己观点和资产阶级思想意识侵入到我们的人中间。
    这就是说，必须加强注意对劳动人民进行共产主义教育的任务和在他们身上培养共产主义时代的人的高尚道德品质，例如忠于共产主义事业、热爱社会主义祖国、具有无产阶级国际主义和对各国人民友好的精神、憎恨社会主义的敌人、具有集体主义精神、积极参加社会劳动、对社会秩序的破坏者采取不调和的态度。
    应当特别注意培养人们以共产主义态度对待劳动和社会主义财产。对待劳动这种具有社会意义和国家意义的事业、光荣的事业的态度，不断提高劳动生产率，爱护社会主义财产，这些就是苏联人的觉悟程度、他们高尚的精神面貌和他们忠于共产主义事业的最主要的标志。轻视劳动、过寄生生活是一种反社会的现象，而在社会主义制度下，在已经消灭了人剥削人的现象、劳动已经成了为自己、为自己的幸福、为一切人谋福利、为社会主义社会造福的劳动的情况下，则是一种反人民的现象。在我们社会，不应有寄生者和游手好闲者的地位。
    在我们谈到对劳动人民进行共产主义教育的时候，自然，这不仅仅是指各种各样的教育方式和宣传方式，而主要是指革命实践，吸引全体劳动人民一无例外地积极参加社会生产，参与解决共产主义建设的一切实际任务。我们社会主义社会的沸腾生活就是培养苏联人性格的最好的学校、最好的教师和最好的熔炉。
    正确执行关于加强学校同生活的联系和进一步发展苏联国民教育制度的法律，对于教育正在成长的一代以共产主义态度对待劳动，具有十分重大的意义。学校应当保证青年的全面发展，以共产主义精神教育他们，为他们参加国民经济各部门的生产劳动做好实际准备。
    在共产主义教育的巨大工作中，必须充分利用我们党所掌握的各种手段。其中报刊、文学和艺术占有显著的地位。
    我们艺术的方向和内容，艺术把人引向何处，如何帮助培养人的性格，这个问题一向是我们党所特别关心的对象。苏共第二十次代表大会以后，苏共中央不止一次同作家、艺术家、作曲家会见和谈话，广泛地讨论了我国艺术发展的一些根本问题。这些会见对于在原则性的基础上团结文学家和艺术家，对于使他们加强同生活的联系，对于使他们注意现代问题、注意当前苏联现实中的主题等起了重大的作用。
    作家和艺术家正确地理解了党所提出的任务，他们积极参加了反对形形色色的修正主义现象的斗争，他们更加紧密地团结在共产党的周围。这对他们的创作劳动的成果产生了极其良好的影响。最近创作的许多文学艺术作品提出了我国现实当中的重要问题，这些作品得到了社会的赏识。这些作品的主人翁都是当代的先进人物、新生活的创造者、共产主义建设者。创作工作者力求把近几年来苏联人民生活中所发生的深刻变化和新的卓越的过程写到自己作品中，这种抱负值得大力支持。
    党极其珍视和全力支持我们艺术工作者的这些成就，因为它们反映了物质和精神生活各个领域中的普遍高涨，反映了人民主动性和创造性的高涨。但同时，我们不能闭着眼睛不看到文学艺术中的严重缺点。我们的创作工作者还需要做许多工作，来使文学艺术充分履行自己崇高的社会的使命——鼓舞人民起来为共产主义而斗争。
    要使苏联的文学艺术达到能适应其任务的水平，需要有一些什么样的条件呢？
    保证我国艺术发展的重要条件是同异己的思想影响进行坚决的、不调和的斗争。艺术家只有在思想立场完全明确时，才能创作出人民所需要的作品。正因为如此，我们的敌人和他们的修正主义奴仆才卖这么大的力气来对艺术工作者队伍中不坚定分子的思想散播怀疑，制造模糊意识，从而使他们离开唯一正确的道路。修正主义者的进攻被击退了，他们不得不可耻地退却。但是，思想斗争并没有就此停止。我们的艺术应当为苏维埃人的崇高的精神面貌而斗争。
    艺术同人民生活、同共产党的政策的密切联系是决定性条件。我们的艺术的许多缺点首先是由于某些作品的作者对现实中构成其本质的并反映我们社会在向共产主义作伟大的不可遏止的运动的那些新过程和新现象了解得很差。真正伟大的艺术永远产生于对生活进行热情和深刻关怀的研究。当一个作家、一个艺术工作者，积极参加本国人民的生活、参加最正义和最人道的制度——共产主义的建设的时候，他才会获得真正伟大的艺术力量。早在苏共第二十次代表大会上给文学艺术提出的一项任务——不仅在内容丰富多采方面，而且在艺术力量和技巧方面都要居世界的首位——现在正具有特别的意义。
    现在，当社会倡议在国家生活中的作用、群众积极性和人民的主动性的作用有了特别增长的时候，苏联出版事业面临新的、重大的任务。这是一支强大的力量。现在，仅是报纸的发行量就达到六千二百万份左右，而苏共第二十次代表大会前夕的发行量才有四千八百七十万份。此外，现在出版八百五十八种杂志，发行量达二千六百万本，还出版了六万多种书籍，发行量在十一亿册以上。出版工作的宣传和组织作用在党的第二十次代表大会以后有了显著的增长。报纸开始更加深刻和尖锐地阐明党的生活、工业和农业工作以及文化建设了。近几年来，工农通讯员运动活跃起来了。
    但是，即使这样，有许多报纸和杂志目前的思想和文字水平还是不能令人满意的。某些报纸充塞着枯燥无味、空空洞洞的文章和通讯。我们也出版了不少不需要的和没有意思的书籍和杂志。
    必须提高出版物的作用和威信。现在，我们的书报以及口头宣传鼓动的主要任务在于：使全体劳动人民意识到七年计划的政治、经济和文化任务的伟大意义，意识到展现在国家面前的令人鼓舞的前景的伟大意义，动员并组织我国人民的天才、能力、意志和主动精神去为争取共产主义、争取实现党所拟定的进一步发展国民经济的措施，为增加金属、机器产量、石油和煤的开采量、发电量、谷物、肉类、奶类、衣服、靴鞋的产量和住宅的建设而斗争。
  苏共代表大会将在人类历史上打开新纪元
  帝国主义及其仆从不能阻挠历史向前发展
    苏联发展国民经济的七年计划是通向共产主义的笔直而明确的道路。七年计划的完成，将更加提高苏联的威力，更加加强伟大的社会主义阵营，对全世界社会发展的全部过程以及全人类的命运产生良好的影响，更加明确地证明社会主义制度对资本主义制度的优越性，巩固和平和削弱来自帝国主义国家的战争威胁。
    中华人民共和国和强大的社会主义阵营中其他的一些国家，同苏联并肩前进，坚定不移地走向社会主义，不断取得越来越激动人心的胜利，社会主义制度和资本主义制度这两个世界体系的力量对比正在发生有利于社会主义的决定性变化。据经济学家计算，由于完成和超额完成七年计划的结果，由于所有社会主义国家的经济胜利发展的结果，领土占地球面积约26％、人口占全世界居民约35％的社会主义国家的产品产量，将超过世界上其他所有国家。这是一个足以使整个资本主义制度发抖的社会主义的胜利。（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    世界社会主义体系的胜利也将有助于巩固不久前从殖民主义奴役下解放出来的国家的独立，有助于殖民地和附属国中民族解放斗争的发展，有助于加速殖民体系崩溃的过程。
    我们的七年计划和其他社会主义国家的成就将是对资本主义国家中的工人运动和共产主义运动的强有力的精神上的支持，自从1957年莫斯科共产党和工人党代表会议以来，资本主义国家中的工人运动和共产主义运动在同反动派进行激烈的斗争中取得了新的胜利。共产党和工人党的团结和国际主义的兄弟联系在莫斯科会议宣言的马克思列宁主义原则上加强了。企图分裂社会主义阵营、国际工人运动和共产主义运动、从而为社会主义的敌人效劳的修正主义者受到了毁灭性的打击。
    帝国主义者和他们的仆从想要阻挠各国人民向社会主义胜利前进。但是，这种企图必定失败。反动势力企图堵住各国人民走向民主、社会主义和和平的道路，就等于是违抗大自然的力量。充满恐惧的反动派的任何迫害和恐怖手段，改良主义和修正主义首领的任何诅咒都不能阻止历史的进步发展。资本主义拚命挣扎，想把头部浮在水面上，但这越来越困难了，无疑地，它将被自己对人类所犯下的罪行拉入水底，把位置让给真正进步的社会政治制度——社会主义的日子不远了。（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    同志们！我们共产党是在团结而强大的情况下召开它的第二十一次代表大会的。在第二十次和第二十一次代表大会之间，党进一步加强了它同工人、集体农民、知识分子广大群众的联系，它现在比任何时候都更受到全体苏联人民的无限热爱。党恢复了列宁主义的建党原则，在它的一切组织的巨大创造高潮和巨大积极性的气氛当中生活和活动着。
    党粉碎和摒弃了反对中央委员会的列宁主义政策、反对苏联人民根本利益的马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团，进一步团结了自己的队伍，成为社会主义和马克思列宁主义的一切敌人所不可战胜的强大堡垒。（掌声）。
    我们党在国际舞台上的威信是巨大的，全世界都在倾听它的声音。我们的代表大会现在是全世界公众注意的中心，这并不是偶然的。
    我们党作为苏联人民的先进和领导队伍的主要力量在哪里？这就在于它是以马克思列宁主义的不可战胜的学说武装起来的，它永远忠于这个学说并且经常在实践的基础上丰富这个学说。
    以这个学说为基础的党的第二十一次代表大会的决议，将在人类历史上打开一个新的纪元——全面展开共产主义社会建设的纪元。由代表大会的决议所武装起来的党，将更高地举起马克思列宁主义的旗帜，以坚定的列宁主义方针引导苏联人民走向共产主义在我国的完全胜利。
  （暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）。
