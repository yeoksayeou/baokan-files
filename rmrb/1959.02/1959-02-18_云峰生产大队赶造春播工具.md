Yunfeng Production Brigade Rushes to Manufacture Spring Planting Tools
    This newspaper, Lanzhou, 17th – The Yunfeng Production Brigade of the Yunfeng People's Commune in Qin'an County, Gansu Province, is vigorously carrying out a technical revolution, so that each laborer in the brigade has an average of one advanced tool, and work efficiency has generally improved.
    In the spring of 1958, with the attention of the county party committee, the Yunfeng Brigade established an agricultural tool innovation and manufacturing plant. This plant has successively created and promoted 15 kinds of advanced tools, totaling 154 pieces; at the same time, it imitated 187 rope traction machines and deep digging tools; more than 200 light vehicles were equipped with ball bearings, and the brigade basically realized the vehicularization of transportation, ropeway construction, new-style tool application for farming, and semi-mechanization of flour milling. This agricultural tool factory also continuously reforms tools in combination with various production campaigns and agricultural seasons. For example, in the mass campaign for iron and steel production, it created a long-distance high-line conveyor to transport ore; in the autumn soil and water conservation campaign, it created a soil turning vehicle, an automatic loading and unloading vehicle, a wooden train, a embankment tamping device and a embankment building device; in the autumn sowing, it created a sowing machine that combines sowing, fertilizer transportation, soil crushing, and leveling; it also successfully created a wind power generator, sprinkling the remote Yunfeng Mountain with "pearls of the night." Now, the team is vigorously carrying out a comprehensive spring plowing preparation campaign centered on manure accumulation, and is actively creating advanced tools such as spring crop interplanting sowing machines and wheat field weeding machines to welcome spring sowing and summer hoeing.

    云峰生产大队赶造春播工具
    本报兰州17日电　甘肃省秦安县云峰人民公社云峰生产大队，大闹技术革命，使全队每个劳动力平均有一件先进工具，工效普遍提高。
    1958年春天，在县委的重视下，云峰大队即建立了农具革新制造厂，这个厂先后创造推广先进工具十五种共一百五十四件；同时仿制了绳索牵引机、深挖器共一百八十七件；二百多辆轻便车辆都安装了滚珠轴承，全队基本实现了运输车辆化、索道化、种田新式工具化、磨面半机械化。这个农具厂还结合各个生产运动和农事季节，不断进行工具改革。例如在全民大办钢铁运动中，创造了长途高线过送器，运送矿石；在秋季水土保持运动中，创造了翻土车、自动装卸车、木火车、拍埂器和筑埂器；在秋播中，创造了播种、运肥、碎土、磨平四用播种机；还创造成功了风能动力发电机，给偏僻的云峰山撒下了夜明珠。现在，该队在大搞以积肥为中心的全面备耕运动中，正积极创造春播作物间种播种机、麦田锄草机等先进工具，迎接春播夏锄。
