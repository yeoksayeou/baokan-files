Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, February 25th: The workers of the Hongshan Coal Mine's No. 52 Coal Mining Area in Zibo, Shandong Province, have been working hard and skillfully, achieving high coal production in a thin coal seam less than one meter thick. Since last year, the monthly output has exceeded the 10,000-ton mark for twelve months, and it has been rated as a red flag mining area among the mines in Zibo. In mid-February of this year, the output surged again to 9,658 tons.

Last year, the No. 52 Coal Mining Area produced more than 144,000 tons of coal for the country, comprehensively completing the plan. Since the beginning of this year, through mass discussions, workers have overcome conservative ideas, firmly grasped the key of organizing regular cyclical operations, and strived to increase the daily output of the working face. In long working faces, they organized rapid coal cutting, rapid transfer and installation, and rapid pillar removal to ensure the completion of a regular cycle within 24 hours; when the working face was shortened, it was changed to double or multiple cycles, and the depth of coal cutting was increased to turn the short working face into a long working face, improving production efficiency.

The coal seam in this area is thin, with many faults, and the mechanical equipment is also poor. The area's leading cadres and workers have studied and experimented together, taking measures such as leveling and straightening the body of the coal conveyor during installation, aligning the ends, and inspecting each ring and section during shift handover, which greatly improved the regularity of the cycle.

    洪山五十二采煤区高举高产红旗
    月月突破万吨关
    据新华社济南25日电　山东淄博洪山煤矿五十二采煤区的职工苦干巧干，在厚度不到一公尺的薄煤层里获得了煤炭高产。从去年以来，有十二个月的月产量都突破万吨大关，在淄博各矿中被评为红旗采煤区。今年2月中旬产量又猛增到九千六百五十八吨。
    五十二采煤区去年共为国家生产了十四万四千多吨煤，全面地完成了计划。今年以来，职工通过鸣放辩论，克服保守思想，紧紧抓住了组织正规循环作业这一关键，努力提高工作面的日产量。在长工作面，他们就组织快速截煤、快速移装、快速撤柱，保证在二十四小时内完成一个正规循环；工作面缩短，就改为双循环或多循环，并把截煤深度加大，使短工作面变成长工作面，提高了生产效率。
    这个区煤层薄，断层较多，机械设备也较差，区的领导干部和工人一起研究、试验，采取了在安装运煤机时把机身垫平摆直，首尾找正，交接班时逐环逐节检查等措施，使正规循环率大大提高。
