Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch: The work of preferential treatment in various places achieved great success last year. Especially after the realization of the people's communes, the work of preferential treatment has had new developments, so that the lives of the families of martyrs and military personnel have been better improved.

Before the realization of the people's communes in the first 9 months of last year, the state allocated 92.98 million yuan for preferential treatment, pensions, and living welfare expenses for families of martyrs, military personnel, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers. Agricultural producers' cooperatives also implemented preferential treatment labor days for families of martyrs, military personnel, and some disabled soldiers who had no or lacked labor, guaranteeing their lives. Before the realization of the people's communes, preferential treatment work in many areas had already become a mass and regular activity, such as organizing many preferential treatment groups, or designating special personnel to be responsible for specific areas, regularly solving the difficulties in daily life for the helpless elderly families of martyrs and military personnel. The Huachang Street Residents' Committee in Bengbu City, Anhui Province, established fifteen preferential treatment groups, regularly washing clothes, carrying water, cooking, and cleaning for families of martyrs and military personnel who lacked labor, and helping them introduce occupations and find production avenues. These preferential treatment groups also have "Preferential Treatment Merit Books," which have recorded 57 books and nearly a thousand examples of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families in the past two years. When Pan Hong, a second lieutenant officer of the Volunteer Army, returned home to visit relatives, he read these merit books and said with emotion: "The government and the masses are always concerned about our families, and I will definitely do a good job to repay the people."

After the realization of the people's communes, the production and lives of rural families of martyrs, military personnel, and disabled soldiers have been properly arranged and taken care of. The Shuguang People's Commune in Guoyang County, Anhui Province, has arranged appropriate work and production for women laborers and semi-laborers among the families of martyrs and military personnel, and helped them learn production techniques. Some older families of martyrs and military personnel have been assigned to livestock farms and sewing groups to engage in lighter labor. Because the people's communes implemented a distribution system combining wages and supply systems, the lives of the families of martyrs, military personnel, and disabled soldiers have been reliably guaranteed and have been improved more than in the past. In order to take care of the difficulties in the lives of families of martyrs and military personnel who have no or lack labor, many communes have also implemented preferential treatment methods to ensure that their income is not lower than the wage level of ordinary people.

Many areas have also established retirement homes for families of martyrs (some areas are called Homes of Glory) after the realization of the people's communes, to give better care to those helpless elderly families of martyrs and elderly disabled soldiers. According to statistics from only nine provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, including Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Shanghai, 439 retirement homes for families of martyrs have been established, with 3,258 families of martyrs admitted. Their clothing, food, and pocket money are provided by the people's communes, and local party and government officials and the masses often visit and comfort them in the homes. Retirement homes for families of martyrs are a new measure in the work of preferential treatment since the Great Leap Forward in our country. It enables helpless families of martyrs to receive more care and concern than when they were living separately, ensuring that they spend a happy old age.

In the cities, the civil affairs departments actively organize urban families of martyrs, military personnel, and disabled soldiers to participate in social welfare production. According to statistics from only seven cities including Shanghai, Harbin, Jinan, Qingdao, Anshan, Fuzhou, and Zhengzhou, as many as 5,501 people have participated in social welfare production. For families of martyrs and military personnel who have not participated in production or whose income after participating in production is not enough to maintain their lives, many cities also provide them with living subsidies to improve their lives.

### 生产组织得好　生活安排得好  烈属军属的生活在农村公社化后得到更好改善

    生产组织得好　生活安排得好
    烈属军属的生活在农村公社化后得到更好改善
    新华社6日讯　各地的优抚工作在去年获得很大成绩。特别在实现人民公社化以后，优抚工作有了新的发展，使烈属、军属的生活得到更好的改善。
    在去年实现人民公社化以前的1至9月份中，国家拨给烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人的优待、抚恤和生活福利费用就有九千二百九十八万元，农业生产合作社还对无劳动力和缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属及一部分残废军人实行了优待劳动日的优待办法，保证了他们的生活。在实现人民公社化以前，很多地区的优抚工作就已成为群众性的经常活动，如组织了很多优抚小组，或者指定专人分片包干，经常为无依无靠的孤老烈属、军属解决日常生活上的困难。安徽省蚌埠市华昌街居民委员会建立了十五个优抚小组，经常为缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属洗衣、担水、做饭和打扫卫生、并帮助他们介绍职业、找生产门路。这些优抚小组还设有“优抚记功簿”，两年来记载了五十七本、近千件拥军优属的事例。志愿军少尉军官潘洪回家探亲时翻看了这些记功簿，感动地说：“政府和群众时刻关怀我们的家属，我一定做好工作报答人民”。
    在实现人民公社化以后，农村烈属、军属和残废军人的生产和生活更得到了妥善安排和照顾。安徽省涡阳县曙光人民公社对烈属、军属中的妇女劳动力和半劳动力，都安排了适当的工作和生产，并帮助她们学习生产技术。一些年纪较大的烈属、军属被分配到畜牧场、缝纫组从事较轻微的劳动。由于人民公社实行了工资制与供给制相结合的分配制度，烈属、军属和残废军人的生活得到了可靠的保障，而且比过去更为改善。为了照顾无劳动力和缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属生活上的困难，许多公社还实行了优待金办法，保证他们的收入不低于一般群众的工资水平。
    许多地区在实现人民公社化以后还举办了烈属养老院（有些地区叫光荣之家），对那些无依无靠的老年烈属、老年残废军人给以更好的照顾。仅据河北、山西、内蒙古、上海等九个省、自治区、直辖市的统计，就办起四百三十九个烈属养老院，入院的烈属达三千二百五十八人。他们穿衣、吃饭、零用钱都由人民公社供给，当地党政负责干部和群众经常到院里去看望、慰问他们。烈属养老院是我国大跃进以来在优抚工作上一项新的措施，它使无依靠的烈属比分散居住得到更多的照顾和关怀，保证了他们愉快地过着幸福的晚年。
    在城市里，民政部门积极组织城市烈属、军属和残废军人参加社会福利生产。仅据上海、哈尔滨、济南、青岛、鞍山、福州、郑州七个城市统计，参加社会福利生产的即达五千五百零一人。对没有参加生产或参加生产后所得的收入还不足以维持生活的烈属、军属，许多城市还发给他们生活补助费，以改善他们的生活。
