This Year's Production Will Definitely Surpass Last Year
Neijiang Prefecture Sums Up Great Leap Forward Experiences; Cadres and Masses Have High Confidence and Are Full of Energy

Chengdu, February 3rd (This newspaper dispatches) The current rural situation in Neijiang Prefecture, Sichuan Province, is excellent. The masses' political enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high, and their production drive is soaring. A vigorous production upsurge, even greater than last year's, is taking shape. This is what Liu Haiquan, Secretary of the CPC Sichuan Provincial Neijiang Prefectural Committee, told reporters after recently going deep into the countryside and extensively contacting farmers.

Comrade Liu Haiquan traveled to five counties and focused on visiting ten representative people's communes. In addition to convening fifteen large and small symposiums, he also had individual talks with many commune members and grassroots cadres. He said that in the areas he visited, whether along transportation lines or in remote mountainous areas, the masses were all beaming with joy and not frowning. Everyone was very enthusiastic, talking about achievements, sharing experiences, and offering opinions freely and without reservation. What impressed him most was that the broad masses of commune members had a very high evaluation of the Great Leap Forward of 1958, and they spoke about it with great animation. They said that the Great Leap Forward of 1958 was equivalent to seven or eight years; 1958 was full of new things, both intense and satisfying. Everyone agreed that 1958 was not simple: a lot of work was done, many movements were launched, many miracles were created, many superstitions were broken, many talents were cultivated, and many experiences were accumulated. The district's grain production increased by 95%, cotton production increased by 125%, and sugarcane production increased by 65%, basically achieving the goals set at the beginning of the year of producing 1,000 jin of grain, 100 jin of cotton, and 10,000 jin of sugarcane per mu. They said that if it weren't for the Great Leap Forward, they would never have dared to dream of such a large increase in production. People feel that this year they must engage in production even more enthusiastically to make it "flavorful" and "enjoyable."

Liu Haiquan said that the commune members were particularly enthusiastic about the people's communes. Although the communes were only recently established, the preliminary superiority they had shown in production and life had deeply penetrated people's hearts. From their experiences in the large-scale steel production and the "Four Autumns" rush work last year, they concluded that with the people's communes, they were not afraid of too much work or tight labor. As long as they were willing to work hard, even the greatest difficulties could be overcome. Mentioning that they don't need to pay for meals after joining the commune and receive monthly wages, everyone smiled happily. He heard that some people were so excited that they shed tears when they received their first wages. The living standards of most commune members in the region have caught up with and surpassed those of wealthy middle peasants. The improvement in living conditions has greatly promoted the masses' enthusiasm for production. They describe their current mood as "one worry, a hundred no worries." "A hundred no worries" means that they don't have to worry about eating, clothing, or using things; "one worry" is worrying about how to improve production. Cadres of the Zhongtian People's Commune in Lezhi County, in order to ensure that commune members have enough sleep, stipulated that they should get up at six o'clock, and the power station should generate electricity at five thirty. The masses commented that the power generation was too late and asked to generate electricity earlier so that they could eat earlier and go to work earlier. Labor has become a conscious action of the masses. The Prefectural Committee Secretary said that they often encountered commune members accumulating and transporting fertilizer late at night, without the leadership of cadres or the commune's regulations. They were automatically working overtime to eliminate the "three types of seedlings" in a timely manner.

Liu Haiquan said that the spring crops in various places are growing very well, with 400,000 to 500,000 ears of wheat per mu. Even some old farmers say that as long as post-management is strengthened, this year's output can be doubled without any problem. Commune members have full confidence in this year's production. They believe that they have accumulated experience last year, and this year they have the people's commune and sufficient material preparation. If they don't double the output, it won't be considered a leap forward. When discussing and formulating this year's production plans, the production increase targets proposed by commune members were higher than those estimated by cadres. It is worth noting that in the rectification of communes in various places, the thousands upon thousands of opinions raised by the masses did not criticize any work last year as being too rash. On the contrary, many opinions were directed at some cadres' right-leaning conservatism and complacency.

The Prefectural Committee Secretary said that it should be noted that the enthusiasm of general cadres this year is greater than last year, their experience is more abundant, and their work is more practical. However, it should also be noted that a few cadres have varying degrees of slackness, which leads to their leadership lagging behind the masses and their thinking not keeping up with the development of the situation. Their prominent manifestation is that they are shrinking back from a greater leap forward in 1959. According to the analysis of the Prefectural Committee Secretary, the main reason for this situation is that they have underestimated the achievements of the Great Leap Forward last year and have not summarized it enough; they have not clearly seen the favorable conditions this year. Therefore, he believes that, in response to these problems, solving the right-leaning conservatism in the thinking of a few cadres, boosting greater enthusiasm, striving for advancement, has become the key to realizing the production tasks of 1959. He mentioned that the Party committees in various places have done a lot of work in this area and have already achieved great results.

Recently, various counties in Neijiang Prefecture have universally convened three-level cadre meetings, where most of the time was spent helping cadres summarize achievements and experiences, using the factual to lead the virtual, and discussing the virtual based on the factual. Combined with the summary, they also conducted a specific analysis of the current rural situation and the favorable conditions after communization. Facts have proved that a serious and in-depth summary of the achievements and experiences of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 is an effective way to unify cadres' thinking and improve understanding. Many cadres, through lively summaries, systematized and rationalized their past experiences, felt that they had capital, and their confidence was immediately enhanced. They briefly summarized their rich experience into several points such as "grasping tightly, grasping early, engaging in movements, frequent inspection, more comparisons, and participating in labor." They believe that as long as they continue to carry forward these experiences in the future, they can generate unparalleled power. The more they analyze the current favorable conditions, the more they despise the difficulties in front of them—the negative and timid emotions are swept away.

Recently, when the Prefectural Committee issued an emergency call to launch a fertilizer accumulation campaign, cadres throughout the prefecture, based on a past experience: "start working first, then solve the specific problems," quickly dispatched a one-million-person army to accumulate fertilizer, accumulating farm manure and creating soil fertilizer on a large scale. Other tasks such as spring field management and tool reform were also driven forward.

    今年生产定能超过去年
    内江专区总结大跃进经验，干部群众信心高干劲足
    本报成都3日电　四川内江专区当前的农村形势好得很，群众政治热情空前饱满，生产干劲冲天，一个轰轰烈烈的比去年更大的生产高潮正在形成。这是中共四川省内江地委书记刘海泉新近深入农村和农民广泛接触回来后对记者说的。
    刘海泉同志这次曾走遍了五个县，重点访问了有代表性的十个公社，除召集了十五次大小座谈会外，还和许多社员和基层干部进行了个别谈心。他说，他所走过的地区，不论是交通沿线或是边沿山区，群众都是喜气洋洋、没有愁眉苦脸的。个个都很热情，讲成绩，谈体会，提意见，有啥讲啥，毫无拘束。给他印象最深的是，广大社员对1958年大跃进的评价很高，谈起来眉飞色舞。他们说，1958年大跃进，一年要当七、八年；1958年样样是新事，又紧张、又惬意。大家一致认为1958年不简单：做了许多工作，搞了许多运动，创造了许多奇迹，破除了许多迷信，培养了许多人材，积累了许多经验。全区粮食增产95％，棉花增产125％，甘蔗增产65％，基本上实现了年初提出的亩产千斤粮、百斤棉、万斤蔗的口号。他们说，要不是大跃进，做梦也不敢想增产这么多。人们觉  得今年一定要比去年更加热火朝天  地搞生产才“有味”才“过瘾”。
    刘海泉说，社员们特别津津乐道的是人民公社。虽然公社都成立不久，但在生产和生活上初步显示出来的优越性已深入人心。他们从去年大办钢铁和四秋突击工作中得出的结论是，有了人民公社就不怕活路多，劳力紧；只要肯干，再大的困难也能克服。提起入了公社吃饭不要钱，按月拿工资，人人喜笑颜开，听说有些人在领到第一次工资时激动得流出眼泪。全区大多数社员的生活水平已赶上和超过富裕中农。生活的改善大大推动了群众的生产热情，他们形容自己现在的心情是“一焦百不愁”。百不愁是说吃、穿、用百事都不用愁了；一焦是焦心如何把生产搞得更好。乐至县中田人民公社的干部，为了照顾社员有足够的睡眠，规定六点钟起床，电站五点半发电。群众提意见说，发电太晚了，要求提前发电，早吃饭早出工。劳动已成了群众自觉性的行动。这位地委书记说，我们沿途常常在深夜还遇到社员在积肥、运肥，没有干部带领，社里也没有规定，他们是为了及时消灭三类苗自动加班加点的。
    刘海泉说，各地的小春作物都长得很好，小麦每亩有四十万到五十万穗。连一些老农也说，只要加强后期管理，今年的产量打两个滚没问题。社员们对今年的生产，信心百倍。他们认为去年积下了经验，今年又有了公社，物质也有充足的准备，不翻他两番就不算跃进。许多公社在讨论制定今年的生产规划时，社员提出的增产指标，比干部预计的高。值得重视的是，各地整社中，群众提出的成千成万条意见，没有人批评去年某项工作冒进了，相反的有不少意见是针对着某些干部的右倾保守和自满松劲情绪提的。
    这位地委负责人说，应该看到一般干部今年的干劲比去年更大，经验更加丰富，工作做得更加踏实。但是，也应该看到有少数干部存在着程度不同的松劲现象，从而领导落后于群众，思想赶不上形势发展。他们突出的表现是对1959年更大的跃进畏缩不前。据地委书记分析，产生这种情况的主要原因是对去年大跃进的成绩估计不足，总结不够；对今年的有利条件看得不清。因此，他认为针对这些问题，解决少数干部思想上的右倾保守，鼓足更大的干劲，力争上游，已成为实现1959年生产任务的关键。他谈到各地党委在这方面已做了许多工作，并已收到很大成效。
    最近内江专区各县普遍召开了三级干部会议，会上都是用大部分时间帮助干部总结成绩和经验，以虚带实，就实论虚。结合总结，又对目前农村形势和公社化后的有利条件进行具体分析。事实证明，认真地深入地总结1958年大跃进取得的成绩和经验，是统一干部思想，提高认识的有效办法。许多干部通过生动活泼的总结，把过去的经验系统化、条理化，感到有了本钱，信心立即增强了。他们把丰富的经验简要地归纳为“抓得紧，抓得早，搞运动，勤检查，多评比，同劳动”等几条，今后只要继续发扬这些经验，就能产生无比的力量。他们越分析当前的有利条件，也就越蔑视横在面前的困难——消极畏难的情绪一扫而空。
    最近，地委发出开展积肥运动的紧急号召时，全专区干部根据过去的一条经验：“先干起来，再解决具体问题”，很快就出动了一百万人的积肥大军，大积农家肥，大造土化肥。其他小春田间管理、工具改革等工作，也被带动起来。
