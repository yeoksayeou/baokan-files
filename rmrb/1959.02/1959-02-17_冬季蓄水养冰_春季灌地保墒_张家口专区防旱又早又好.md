Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou News – While vigorously engaging in accumulating and delivering manure, Zhangjiakou Prefecture, Hebei Province, People's Communes are also paying early attention to drought prevention, moisture conservation, and land irrigation.

The Zhangjiakou region has historically experienced windy and dry springs with insufficient river water, often leading to some land being unable to be sown in a timely manner due to lack of moisture. Since last winter, People's Communes in various localities have utilized the abundant water sources in mountain valleys, river ditches, and springs to vigorously develop artificial water storage and ice cultivation, in order to increase water sources and expand the area of land irrigation and moisture conservation during the spring thaw. The entire prefecture has adopted methods such as building earth weirs and damming water to store and cultivate over 50 million cubic meters of ice along more than 100 large and small rivers and ditches, which, when completely melted, can expand the spring irrigation area by 500,000 mu.

In the vigorous development of water storage and ice cultivation, the wisdom of the masses has been relied upon to overcome many difficulties. The Zuowei People's Commune in Huai'an County created a method of diverting and intercepting water, dispersing river water and storing it in the river beaches, cultivating 800,000 cubic meters of ice in ten days and nights. Farmers along the Linquan River in Huailai County and the Ximalin River in Huai'an County draw ice water to irrigate land during the warm days, and accumulate ice during the night or when it is cold. Not only did they cultivate ice all winter, but they also used ice water to irrigate more than 20,000 mu of land. Yong'anbao, Culiuping, Gaomiao and other villages in Huai'an used well, spring and mountain ditch snowmelt to irrigate more than 200 mu of land.

At present, as the climate gradually warms, Party committees and People's Communes at all levels, while focusing on the intensive accumulation and delivery of manure, are taking effective measures to investigate soil moisture and use all possible water sources to irrigate land and conserve moisture.

### 冬季蓄水养冰　春季灌地保墒  张家口专区防旱又早又好

    冬季蓄水养冰　春季灌地保墒
    张家口专区防旱又早又好
    新华社张家口讯　河北张家口专区在大搞积肥送粪同时，各人民公社及早注意防旱、保墒、灌地工作。
    张家口地区历年来春季多风少雨，河水不足，部分土地常因缺墒不能适时春播。去冬以来，各地人民公社利用山峪、河沟、泉溪水源丰富的条件，大力开展人工蓄水养冰，以备春季解冻时加大水源，扩大灌地保墒面积。全专区采用垒土堰、筑坝拦水等方法，在一百多条大小河沟沿岸蓄水养冰五千多万公方，全部融化后可扩大春灌面积五十万亩。
    在大搞蓄水养冰中，依靠群众智慧克服了许多困难。怀安县左卫人民公社创造了分水截流的办法，把河水分散蓄在河滩，十昼夜养冰八十万公方。怀来县的林泉河、怀安县的洗马林河沿岸的农民们，白天天暖引冰水灌地，夜晚或天冷就积冰。一冬天不但养了冰，还利用冰水灌地两万多亩。怀安永安堡、醋柳坪、高庙等村利用井、泉和山沟化雪水，灌了二百多亩地。
    目前，气候逐渐暖和，各级党委和人民公社在突击积肥送粪同时，正在采取有效措施进行查墒、验墒，并利用一切可能利用的水源灌地保墒。
