Fertilizer Accumulation Rhyme
　　How can the stars compare to manure piles?
　　Trees on the mountains stand row by row,
　　Stars in the sky are many and many,
　　Manure piles on the ground are close together,
　　How can the stars compare to manure piles?
　　　　(Yunnan Folk Song)

　　Get up early and go to the grassland
　　Get up early and go to the grassland,
　　Who can wait for the dew to dry?
　　Even if the dew doesn't dry, we must go,
　　To accumulate ten thousand dan of fertilizer.
　　Come to the grassland and take a careful look,
　　Carrying poles and ropes are spread all over the mountain,
　　Hurriedly run forward,
　　Quick steps rush to catch up with companions.
　　Looking from afar, smoke drifts from the village,
　　Grass-cutting companions compete with each other,
　　My half-load is not enough,
　　Other people's loads are already on their shoulders.
　　　　(Yunnan Folk Song)

　　Not a hill, but fertilizer
　　The sun sets late in the evening,
　　Go to the lower village for a meeting, crossing the river bay,
　　Hear the rooster crow and the dog bark,
　　But don't see the village, only small hills.
　　Shine the flashlight,
　　Not hills, but fertilizer,
　　Several large piles of high-temperature compost,
　　Piled even higher than the house roof.
　　　　(Li Maorong)

　　I am taller than the moon
　　I am taller than the moon,
　　Standing in the middle of the sky,
　　It's not that I'm growing fast,
　　It's that the fertilizer pile under my feet is growing higher and higher.
　　I am taller than the moon,
　　White clouds float under my feet.
　t that the white clouds are flying low,
　　It's that the fertilizer pile is higher than the clouds.
　　I am taller than the moon,
　　Stars are at my waist,
　　It's not that the stars have fallen to the ground,
　　It's that the fertilizer pile is higher than the sky.
　　　　(Yang Zihong)

　　Compete with the Twin Pagodas in height
　　The Twin Pagodas were called soaring into the clouds in ancient times,
　　But now they seem insignificant,
　　Piles of manure stand tall and laugh,
　　Wanting to compete with the Twin Pagodas in height.
　　　　(Fan Zhenyang)

　　Be a soldier of the Grain Commander
　　Stars fill the sky on both sides of the Milky Way,
　　A sea of lights in front of the village pond, shining, a field of hoes gleam silver, a sound of digging earth. Each hoe has doubled energy, being a good soldier of the Grain Commander, red faces smiling, watching the pond turn over. A mountain of people hauling black soil, thousands and ten thousands of dan cannot be counted, sweat soaks the battle robe until dawn, the fertilizer pile is higher than Motianling Mountain.
　　　　(Huang Yuanzhen)

　　The fertilizer mountain is ten thousand feet high, the broom sweeps, dust flies, fertilizer accumulators fill the roads. Aunts sweep, uncles carry, young people's shovels fly, sisters-in-law carry baskets busily. The soil is shoveled into a fertilizer mountain, children climb halfway up the mountain. In the spring, the fertilizer mountain is ten thousand feet high, in the autumn, the grain mountain pierces the clouds.
　　　　(Wang Daoqing)

### 积肥谣

专栏：

   积肥谣星星哪有粪堆多
  山上树木棵对棵，
  天上星星多又多，
  地上粪堆个挨个，
  星星哪有粪堆多。
        （云南民歌）清早起来上草山
  清早起来上草山，
  哪个等得露水干，
  露水不干也要走，
  为了积肥千万担。
  来在草山细看看，
  扁担皮条摆遍山，
  急急忙忙往前跑，
  快步如飞赶伙伴。
  远看村前飘火烟，
  割草伙伴齐争先，
  我的半担还不够，
  别人担子上了肩。
        （云南民歌）不是山包是肥料
  天晚太阳落下山，
  下村开会过河湾，
  听到鸡叫和狗咬，
  不见村子见小山。
  手捏电筒照一照，
  不是山包是肥料，
  高温堆肥几大堆，
  堆得还比房头高。
          （李茂荣）
  我比月亮高
  我比月亮高，
  站在天中腰，
  不是我长得快，
  脚下肥堆节节高。
  我比月亮高，
  白云在我脚下飘。
  不是白云飞的矮，
  肥料堆得比云高。
  我比月亮高，
  星星在我半中腰，
  不是星星落下地，
  肥料堆得比天高。
          （杨自宏）要与双塔比低高
  古称双塔凌云霄，
  如今看来不足道，
  堆堆粪肥昂首笑，
  要与双塔比低高。
          （樊贞洋）当好粮帅一员兵
  银河两岸满天星，
  庄前池塘一片灯，满塘锄头银光闪，挖泥一片响土声。把把锄头倍加劲，当好粮帅一员兵，张张红脸笑盈盈，笑看池塘大翻身。人山人海运黑土，千担万担数不清，汗湿战袍到天明，肥堆高过摩天岭。
        （黄元振）肥山高万丈扫帚响，尘土扬，积肥人儿满路上。大娘们扫，大爷们挑，年轻人的锹铲飞，大嫂子们抬筐忙。道土铲起成肥山，孩子们爬上半山腰。春天肥山高万丈，秋天粮山插云霄。
        （王道青）
