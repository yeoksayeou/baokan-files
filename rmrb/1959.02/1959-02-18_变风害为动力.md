    Turning Wind Damage into Power
    The Communist Party Committee of Tao'an County
    Tao'an County, Jilin Province, is located in a sandy wasteland, commonly known as the "Eight Hundred Li Dry Sea." Here, the four seasons are windy, with an average wind force of level three or higher. People often use the two phrases "Wind once a year, from the beginning to the end," and "Summer Solstice goose feathers settle, stone rollers blown up into trees" to describe the prevalence and strength of the wind here. Especially when the spring wind blows, yellow dust fills the sky, sweeping sand and stones. Every spring, the seeds sown on the county's more than 300,000 mu of wind-blown ridges and sand dunes are blown away several times; in summer, there are often rainstorms that blow down tall-stalked crops; and in autumn, when the grain is ripe, it is often damaged by the wind, breaking the glumes, snapping the stems, or blowing away the grains. The amount of grain blown away by the wind each year is countless.

    Turning Harm into Benefit
    Since liberation, the Party organizations and people of Tao'an County have been constantly fighting against wind, sand, and drought. In addition to building water conservancy projects and creating windbreaks to stop wind damage, they have also actively adopted the policy of "turning harm into benefit," making full use of wind power to lift water for irrigation, grind rice, chop grass, and generate electricity. Here, wind damage has already benefited the people, paving a new way for the realization of agricultural mechanization and electrification.

    Is it feasible to use wind power? How to use it? Before the upsurge of agricultural cooperation in 1955, this was still a question. At that time, with the help of the higher-level Party committee, Tao'an County bought a windmill from another area. The trial use showed that it could lift water to irrigate three mu of land per day, opening up the way for the county to utilize wind energy. In 1956, the county Party committee instructed the county farm tool factory to modify the original design based on the Jinzhou "55" model windmill and the local wind conditions. Wind of level two or higher could drive a Liberation-style waterwheel with a lift of two meters, lifting about twelve tons of water per hour, which was deeply supported by the masses. This launched a mass movement to utilize wind energy. During the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958, the shortage of labor and animal power became more prominent. Therefore, in the large-scale spring and summer drought resistance and irrigation campaign, a total of 747 various windmills were promoted, irrigating 1,100 hectares of farmland, equivalent to more than 2,000 horsepower. Due to timely water supply, it is estimated that the average yield of grain per hectare increased by about 1,500 jin. Many farmers wrote poems to praise the "wind" and "windmills" for benefiting people like cattle and horses. They sang:

    Small windmill, so clever,
    Can chop grass, can grind flour,
    Can pump water, can generate electricity.
    Use it during the day to drive machines,
    At night, turn on the lights to study.
    Telephones connect both ends,
    Wireless radios are on the table.
    Strong wind is better than good mules and horses,
    Chairman Mao leads us, and there are no disasters.

    In carrying out the movement to utilize wind power, the wisdom and creativity of the masses were also fully utilized. For example, five workers from a blacksmith shop in Taodong People's Commune used knives, hammers, and saws to make a vertical sail windmill. The Taonan Town carpentry cooperative, in the absence of steel, made a wind-powered machine entirely of wood. The Industrial Bureau, the Farm Tool Factory, and the Joint Mechanical Factory cooperated to successfully create six different types of large wind turbine generators, such as "Satellite," "Leap Forward," and "August 1st." Making the windmill develop from a dedicated purpose to a versatile one.

    Comprehensive Utilization of Wind Power
    Our county's utilization of wind power is only the beginning, and there are many shortcomings and problems in our work. First of all, the superior wind conditions have not been utilized fully and comprehensively; secondly, there is a lack of systematic research on wind power utilization, and both the breadth and method of utilization need to be further improved.

    This year, Tao'an County will more widely use wind power to replace human and animal power, and at the same time promote the comprehensive utilization of wind energy. Our preliminary plan is:
    (1) On the basis of the existing 762 windmills in 1959, develop to 3,000 units, mainly of the "55" type; (2) Remodel 1,500 windmills as processing power; strive to use wind energy for 80% of the power for chopping grass, crushing feed, and processing rice and flour; (3) In 1959, promote 200 wind turbine generators, with a power generation capacity of 1,120 kilowatts, and strive for each work area to use wind power to generate electricity, light up, show movies, and broadcast; (4) Actively experiment and promote the use of windmills to pull deep plows for plowing and threshing.

    变风害为动力
    中共洮安县委会
    吉林洮安县地处沙荒地带，素称“八百里旱海”。这里，四季多风，平均风力达三级以上。人们常用“一年一次风，年始到年终”，“立夏鹅毛住，石头磙子刮上树”这样两句话，来形容这里的风多风大。特别是春风刮起来，真是黄尘弥空，席卷沙石。全县三十余万亩跑风岗、沙包地，每年春季播下种子，都几次被风刮跑；夏季又常出现暴风雨，将高秆农作物刮倒；秋季粮食成熟时，又往往被风磨坏胞子，折断秆茎或搂掉子粒。每年被风刮跑的粮食不计其数。
    变害为利
    解放以来，洮安县党组织和人民，不断与风沙干旱进行斗争，除大兴水利和营造防风林制止风害外，又积极地采取了“变害为利”的方针，充分利用风力提水灌田、磨米、铡草、发电。在这里风害已造福人民，为实现农业机械化、电气化开辟了一条新的途径。
    利用风力行不行？怎么利用？这在1955年农业合作化高潮以前，还是个问题。当时在上级党委的帮助下，洮安县从外地买进一台风车，试用结果每天可提水灌田三亩，为全县利用风能开辟了道路。1956年，县委布置县农具厂以锦州“五五”型风车为基础，根据当地风力情况，修改了原来的设计。二级以上的风就可以带动扬程二公尺的解放式水车，每小时提水十二吨左右，深受群众拥护。从而掀起了群众性的利用风能运动。1958年农业生产大跃进，劳畜力不足的情况更显得突出，因此在春夏大规模的抗旱灌溉运动中，共推广各种风车七百四十七部，灌溉耕地一千一百公顷，相当两千多马力。由于及时供水，估计每公顷平均增产粮食一千五百斤左右。许多农民编了诗歌，来歌颂“风”和“风车”像牛马一样为人们造福的情景。他们唱道：
    小风车，真不善，
    能铡草，能磨面，
    能抽水，能发电。
    白天用它带机器，
    晚上点灯把书念。
    东西两头接电话，
    桌上摆设无线电。
    大风胜过好骡马，
    毛主席领导无灾难。
    在开展利用风力运动中，还充分发挥了群众智慧和创造性。如洮东人民公社一个铁匠炉的五名工人，用刀、锤、锯制成一种立式挂帆风车。洮南镇木工社，在钢铁缺乏的情况下，制成一种全部用木制的风力动力机。工业局、农具厂、合营机械厂大协作，创制成功“卫星号”、“跃进号”、“八一号”等六种型号不同的大型风力发电机。使风车由专用往万能方向发展。
    综合利用风力
    我县利用风力还只是开始，在工作中有不少缺点和问题。首先是对优越的风力条件利用的还不充分，不全面；其次对风力利用缺乏系统的研究，不论利用的广度上和方法上都需要进一步提高。
    今年，洮安县将要更广泛利用风力代替人、畜力，同时提倡综合利用风能。我们的初步规划是：
  （一）1959年在现有七百六十二部风车的基础上，以“五五”型为主，发展到三千部；（二）改制一千五百台风车，作为加工动力；力争铡草、饲料粉碎、米面加工等动力的80％利用风能；（三）1959年风力发电风车推广二百部，发电量一千一百二十瓩，争取每个作业区用风力发电、照明、放映电影和广播；（四）积极试验和推广用风车牵引深耕犁翻地、脱谷等。
