The largest reinforced concrete arch bridge in the country, the Dan River Bridge project, was completed recently, finishing an eighteen-month task in eight months. The quality of the project met the design requirements.

The Dan River Bridge is located on the Zhan (dian) - Dong (guan) line, at the junction of Henan and Shanxi provinces, where the canyon cliffs on both sides are exceptionally steep. The main bridge is more than sixty meters high, with a span of eighty-eight meters; each end of the main bridge has a twelve-meter approach bridge, forming a large arch bridge with a total length of one hundred and forty-five meters. Such a long-span reinforced concrete arch bridge is also the first in Asia. It is thirty-five meters larger than the largest reinforced concrete arch bridge in our country, the Yellow River Bridge on the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, and is a key project on the Zhan-Dong line. The Zhan-Dong line is a railway connecting the Beijing-Guangzhou and Datong-Puzhou lines. The Dan River Bridge is one of the important projects of the Zhan-Dong line.

The completed Dan River Bridge is a single-line bridge. A second-line Dan River Bridge is under construction downstream of this bridge. The two bridges are six meters and six inches apart, the same height, the same length, and the same span, like a pair of rainbows across the mountains on both sides. (Huang Peiyuan)

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, February 16th: Since construction began in mid-January, the Qing Tong Gorge Yellow River Iron Bridge project has progressed rapidly. Now, nearly one hundred meters of the bridge has been erected on the frozen Yellow River and will soon be fully completed.

In order to connect the east and west banks of the Yellow River as soon as possible and ensure the interception and discharge of water from the Yellow River Qing Tong Gorge Water Conservancy Hub project, the bridge construction workers braved the severe cold of minus twenty degrees Celsius to rush to complete all underwater projects and complete the preparation work for the bridge erection before the Yellow River froze. After the bridge erection began, they launched a heated competition. The two groups erecting the upper and lower beams challenged each other, proposing "The lower beam rises one foot, the upper beam follows one foot." Each bridge hole requires more than 20,000 screws and dowels to be tightened, and some workers complete more than 300 a day, exceeding the quota by three or four times. The workers' soaring enthusiasm greatly accelerated the progress of the project, reducing the time spent erecting each bridge hole from the original six days to three days. (Attached picture)

    全国最大跨度的钢筋混凝土拱桥
    丹河大桥建成
    青铜峡铁桥即将完工
    本报讯　一座目前全国最大跨度的钢筋混凝土拱桥——丹河大桥工程，十八个月的任务八个月完成，已于最近竣工。工程质量达到了设计要求。
    丹河大桥在詹（店）东（观）线上，位于河南、山西两省交界处，两岸峡谷峭壁，地势异常艰险。正桥高六十多公尺，跨度八十八公尺；正桥的两端各有十二公尺的引桥，组成一座全长为一百四十五公尺的大拱桥。这样长跨度的钢筋混凝土拱桥在亚洲也还是第一座，它比我国最大跨度的钢筋混凝土拱桥——包兰线上黄河大桥的跨度还大三十五公尺，是詹东线上的关键工程。詹东线是联结京广、同蒲两线的一条铁路。丹河大桥是詹东线的重要工程之一。
    已完工的丹河大桥是一线桥，在这座大桥的下游正在修建二线丹河大桥。两座大桥相距六公尺六公寸，同样高、同样长、同样跨度，像一对彩虹横跨两岸山腰。（黄培元）
    新华社银川16日电　青铜峡黄河铁桥自1月中旬开始架设以来，工程进展迅速。现在，在冰冻的黄河上已经架起桥梁近百公尺，不久即将全部完工。
    为了尽早地沟通黄河东西两岸，保证黄河青铜峡水利枢纽工程截流、放水，修桥工人们冒着摄氏零下二十多度的严寒，在黄河冻冰以前抢修了全部水下工程和完成了架梁的准备工作。架设桥梁开始后，他们又展开了热烈的竞赛。架上梁与架下梁的两个小组相互挑战，提出“下梁架一尺，上梁跟一尺”。每个桥孔要拧进螺丝钉和打进梢子两万多个，有的工人一天就完成三百多个，超过定额三、四倍。工人们的冲天干劲大大加速了工程进展，使架设每孔桥梁所花时间由原来六天缩减为三天。（附图片）
