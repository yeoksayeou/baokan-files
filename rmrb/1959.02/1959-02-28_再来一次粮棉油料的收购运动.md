Another Grain, Cotton, and Oilseed Procurement Campaign
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

The nationwide procurement of agricultural products is now entering its final stage. According to recent investigations by relevant departments in some areas, there is still great potential to be tapped in the procurement of agricultural products. Due to the severe shortage of rural labor during last year's autumn harvest, the harvesting work was done rather crudely, and there was widespread abandonment. Even now, many areas still have about 10% of agricultural products left in the fields uncollected. For example, in Gaoyi County, Hebei Province, an additional twenty-two jin of cottonseed can be picked from each mu of already harvested cotton fields. According to typical investigations in Gaotang County, Shandong Province, it is estimated that 17 million jin of cottonseed can still be gleaned from cotton stalks throughout the county. Because there was little rain last winter, most of the peanuts left in the fields are still intact, and picking them up would allow the state to procure a large amount of additional oilseeds. Secondly, according to some survey materials, production teams of people's communes and individual commune members still have considerable quantities of grain, cotton, and oilseeds that should be sold but have not been. These situations fully demonstrate that the products exist, and there are many of them. As long as the work follows up, the state's stipulated procurement tasks for agricultural products can not only be completed, but in some regions and for some varieties, it may even be possible to exceed the targets.

At present, the key to completing the procurement tasks for grain, cotton, and oil is still the leadership of Party committees at all levels taking political command and strengthening leadership. Now, spring plowing will begin successively in most parts of the country, and time is very tight. If there is any further delay, it will be difficult to pick up the things left in the fields. Party committees at all levels should seize the opportunity, strengthen specific deployments, organize all possible labor forces, and use the gaps in fertilizer accumulation and production to launch another mass "re-collection" and agricultural product sales campaign of appropriate scale, striving to pick up all kinds of agricultural products left in the fields and harvest them all.

In order to mobilize production teams and individual commune members to actively sell grain, cotton, and oilseeds, on the one hand, it is necessary to strengthen the political and ideological education of grassroots cadres and commune members in conjunction with the rectification of communes, and through debates and appraisals, repeatedly publicize to them the important significance of completing the state's stipulated agricultural product procurement plan, and explain the principle that individual interests and local interests must be subordinate to national interests; on the other hand, in light of the specific conditions in various regions, it is also very necessary to stipulate some specific policies and take some measures for material rewards. Facts have proven that on the basis of strengthening political and ideological education, and under the principle of not hindering the unity of people's communes, the formulation of some specific policies and material reward methods has played a very good role in encouraging production teams and commune members to actively sell agricultural products. In order to facilitate the sale of agricultural products by the masses, commercial departments at all levels must now concentrate their efforts on organizing the procurement of agricultural products. While vigorously grasping procurement, commercial departments must also do a good job in the processing and transportation of agricultural products.

Agricultural products, especially grain, cotton, and oilseeds, are extremely important for the national economy and the lives of the broad masses of urban and rural people, and for the stability of the market. The complete or even over-fulfillment of the state's procurement plan for the above-mentioned materials will provide the most reliable material guarantee for promoting a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production this year and for the further prosperity of the market. Its political and economic significance is extremely significant. Commercial staff at all levels and grassroots cadres should, under the leadership of the Party committee, conscientiously implement the spirit of the "nation as a chessboard," continue to exert their energy, rely on the masses, and strive to complete and over-fulfill the state's stipulated procurement tasks for grain, cotton, and oilseeds.

    再来一次粮棉油料的收购运动
    本报评论员
    目前，全国农产品收购工作已经进入最后阶段。根据有关部门最近对一些地区的调查情况来看，农产品的收购是大有潜力可挖的。由于去年秋收时农村劳动力十分紧张，收获工作做得比较粗糙，普遍有丢弃现象。直到目前为止，不少地区甚至还有10％左右的农产品还遗留在地里没收上来。例如河北省高邑县在每亩已经收摘的棉田上，还可以摘回二十二斤籽棉；据山东高唐县的典型调查推算，全县还可以从棉秸上拣出一千七百万斤籽棉。由于去冬雨水较少，遗留在地里的花生大都完好无损，拾回来就可使国家多收购很大一批油料。其次，根据一些调查材料证明，人民公社的各生产队和社员个人手里也还存有相当数量应该出售的粮食、棉花和油料没有出售。这些情况充分说明，东西是有的，而且还有很多。只要工作跟上去，国家规定的农产品收购任务不但可以完成，在某些地区、某些品种上还有可能超额完成。
    当前，完成粮、棉、油收购任务的关键，仍然在于各级党委政治挂帅，加强领导。现在，在全国大部分地区就要陆续开始春耕了，时间非常紧迫，如果再稍一延宕，遗留在地里的东西就很难再拾回来了。各地党委应当抓紧时机，加强具体部署，组织一切可能组织的劳动力，并利用积肥、生产间隙，再发动一次适当规模的群众性“复收”和出售农产品运动的高潮，力争把遗留在地里的各种农产品拣拾干净，全部收获上来。
    为了动员生产队和社员个人踊跃地出售粮食、棉花和油料，一方面要结合整社工作加强对基层干部和社员群众的政治思想教育工作，通过辩论评比等形式，向他们反复宣传完成国家规定的农产品收购计划的重要意义，讲清个人利益、局部利益必须服从国家利益的道理；另一方面针对各地具体情况，规定若干具体政策，采取一些物质奖励的措施也是十分必要的。事实证明在加强政治思想教育的基础上，在不妨碍人民公社统一的原则下，制定一些具体政策和物质奖励办法，对于鼓励生产队和社员群众踊跃出售农产品都起了十分良好的作用。为了便于群众出售农产品，各级商业部门当前还要集中力量做好农产品收购的组织工作。商业部门在大抓收购的同时，还必须做好农产品的加工、调运工作。
    农产品特别是粮食、棉花和油料这三类物资，对于国民经济和广大城乡人民生活、对于市场的稳定都是极端重要的，全部以至超额完成国家对上述物资的收购计划，将为促进今年工农业生产的更大跃进，为市场的进一步繁荣提供最可靠的物质保证。它的政治意义和经济意义都是十分重大的。各级商业工作人员和广大基层干部，都应当在党委的领导下，认真贯彻全国一盘棋的精神，继续鼓足干劲，依靠群众，为完成和超额完成国家规定的粮食、棉花、油料收购任务而奋斗。
