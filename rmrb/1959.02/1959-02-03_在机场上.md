    At the Airport
    Jiang Xianfan
    On a Sunday noon, the office of the Tianjin Business Office of the Civil Aviation Administration was quiet. Suddenly, long-distance calls and urgent telegrams were sent here one after another: Baotou Steel, which is speeding up installation, urgently needed four to five tons of steel pipes for oxygen blowing in its giant blast furnace and must be immediately loaded and airlifted from Tianjin.
    In an instant, all the staff of the business office gathered around the person on duty. They had all rushed over upon hearing the news. Everyone was busy allocating manpower, preparing vehicles, contacting the metallurgical department's warehouse in Tianjin to transport the goods, reporting the situation to the Beijing Administration Bureau of the Civil Aviation Administration, and contacting the aircraft.
    After receiving the call from the Civil Aviation Administration's Business Office, the transportation section of the metallurgical department's warehouse, although the comrades from Baotou Steel had not yet arrived to complete the formalities for picking up the goods, and they did not know which specifications of steel pipes were needed, they preemptively found truck drivers and material managers, opened the warehouse doors, and prepared to pick up the goods at any time. Because it was Sunday, the warehouse porters lived far away and were scattered. Just when there was no solution, the villagers of the nearby people's commune heard about it and immediately sent eight young men rushing over. By the time the Baotou Steel pick-up people hurriedly arrived on a direct express train, they were already weighing and loading the trucks, and soon a truck full of steel pipes drove straight to the airport.
    As jeeps and trucks sped into the airport, an Ilyushin Il-14 giant aircraft with a silver glow had already flown from Beijing and landed. The pilot, co-pilot, mechanic, and radio operator all greeted them happily. This flight crew was temporarily drawn from the flight route in an emergency, and even the Deputy Director of the Beijing Administration Bureau of the Civil Aviation Administration came with them. Because the steel pipes were seven meters long, the Administration Bureau specially dispatched this new type of Il-14 freighter with a long fuselage and large carrying capacity.
    At the airport, a battle to rush and transport goods for Baotou Steel began. The young men from the commune carried the seven-meter-long steel pipes three at a time into the more than two-meter-high cabin door. People were sweating profusely, and the young men shouted, "Let us follow the plane to Baotou Steel to unload the goods, we guarantee to unload quickly, without delaying a minute, and take a look at our great Baotou Steel." In just half an hour, two tons of steel pipes were loaded.
    The next day, two batches of steel pipes, totaling more than four tons, were airlifted to Baotou Steel in a timely manner. On the same day, whether it was the pilots in the air, or the staff of the business office or the warehouse, or the young men from the commune, they all ran around telling each other with excitement when they saw the People's Daily that day, because there was an eye-catching headline on the front page – "Baotou Steel is for the Whole Country, the Whole Country is for Baotou Steel." They might say, "What an interesting Sunday we had." Someone might say, "The little bit of work we did for Baotou Steel is too small."

    在机场上
    蒋先凡
    星期天中午，民航局天津营业处的办公室里静悄悄的。忽然，长途电话和加急电报接连向这里发来：包钢加紧安装中的巨型高炉火急需要四、五吨吹氧气用的钢管，必须立即从天津装货空运。
    顷刻间，值班人的周围聚集起营业处的全体工作人员。他们都是闻讯赶来的。大家忙着调配人力、准备汽车，跟冶金部在天津的仓库联系运货，向民航局北京管理局汇报情况，联系飞机。
    冶金部仓库运输科接到民航局营业处的电话以后，虽然包钢的同志还没赶到办提货手续，也不知需要的是哪种规格型号的钢管，但他们预先找着了卡车司机和管材料的人，打开了仓库的大门，准备好随时提货。因为是星期天，仓库的搬运工人住得又远又分散。正没办法，附近人民公社的老乡们听说了，马上派了八个小伙子飞奔前来。等包钢的提货人趁直达快车匆匆赶到，这里就边过磅边装车，一会儿满载钢管的卡车就直驶机场了。
    吉普车和大卡车飞速驶进机场时，一架银光闪闪的伊尔十四式巨型飞机已经从北京飞来着陆了。正、副驾驶员、机械员和报务员都高兴地迎上前来。这一飞行小组是临时从航线上紧急抽调出来的，连民航局北京管理局的副局长也随同他们前来了。因为钢管有七公尺长，管理局特地派出了这架机身长、载运量大的伊尔十四式新型货机。
    机场上，一场为包钢抢装快运的战斗开始了。公社的小伙子们把七公尺长的钢管三根三根地往两公尺多高的机舱口里抗，人们的身上流着热汗，小伙子嚷道：“让我们随飞机到包钢卸货吧，保证卸得快，不耽误一分钟，顺便看看我们的大包钢。”不过半个钟点，两吨钢管就装完了。
    第二天，两批钢管共四吨多及时空运到了包钢。也就在这一天，无论是空中的飞行员还是营业处或仓库的职工、或者公社的小伙子们，看到了当天的人民日报，都奔走相告兴奋异常，因为报上一版有条醒目的大标题——“包钢为全国，全国为包钢”。他们可能会说：“我们度过了一个多么有意思的星期天。”有人会说：“我们为包钢做的这一点事情太小了。”
