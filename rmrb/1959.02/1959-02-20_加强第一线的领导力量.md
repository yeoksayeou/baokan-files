To Consolidate and Improve People's Communes and Strive for a Greater Leap Forward This Year: Hunan Sends Nearly Ten Thousand Cadres from County-Level and Above Organs to Take on Leadership Roles in Communes; Hubei Implements a Responsibility System Among Rural Cadres Based on Segmented Contracting and Accountability to the End.

    (Our Newspaper) Changsha News – In order to consolidate and improve the people's communes and strive for an even greater leap forward this year, Hunan Province has dispatched a large number of cadres to strengthen the leadership of the people's communes.
    When the people's communes were initially established, the Hunan Provincial Party Committees at all levels paid great attention to strengthening the cadre allocation of the people's communes. The Party Committee Secretaries of all 1,106 communes in the province were generally held by the main cadres of the original districts, of which 30% were county committee members or cadres equivalent to the county level. In order to meet the needs of a greater leap forward, more than 9,400 cadres have recently been transferred from organs at the county level and above to strengthen the leadership of the communes, including 3 Standing Committee members of the Provincial Committee, 2 members of the Provincial Committee, 9 heads of departments and bureaus, 9 secretaries of the prefectural committees, 26 members of the prefectural committees, 48 directors of provincial departments and ministers of prefectural committees, 104 county committee secretaries, 338 county committee members, and 1,042 county bureau chiefs and section chiefs. These cadres generally concurrently serve as secretaries of the commune party committees and secretaries of the general party branches of the brigade.
    Cadres of the communes and brigades are also generally being transferred downwards at all levels to strengthen the leadership of the basic-level production teams. In the Baoding Dongfeng People's Commune, out of 47 cadres, except for 6 who remained in the organs to manage daily work, the others were all fixed at specific points and went deep into the production teams. The commune party committee required everyone to do a good job in five experiments, namely: experiment in managing a production team well, a public canteen well, a factory well, a pig and cattle pen well, and a mu of experimental field. Every cadre should achieve seven good qualities: good work in going deep and completing tasks; good working methods in developing democracy and following the mass line; good care for the lives of the masses and helping the masses solve difficulties; good ideological progress and hard study; good obedience to leadership and organizational discipline; good technical innovation and invention; and good experimental field management. After the cadres of the Taojiang Chaoying Commune went down, they worked with the masses to carry out large-scale experimental fields. In the Qingtan Brigade, 153 commune and team cadres led more than 400 commune members to cultivate more than 1,300 mu of experimental fields, all of which were deeply plowed more than one foot deep, and each mu had accumulated more than 800 dan of fertilizer.

    (Our Newspaper) Wuhan News – Reporter Tian Zhuang reports: In order to further organize a production upsurge, many areas in Hubei are taking an important measure, that is, transferring cadres at all levels, implementing a responsibility system based on segmented contracting and accountability to the end, thereby strengthening frontline leadership and ensuring the comprehensive realization of a greater leap forward in 1959.
    Transferring cadres downwards and enriching the grassroots is one of the main experiences Hubei Province gained in achieving a bumper harvest last year. In the early days of the establishment of the people's communes, there were more cadres at the commune level due to lack of experience. With the rectification, consolidation, and improvement of the people's communes, Party committees at all levels, in accordance with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, have generally streamlined their institutions, transferred cadres downwards, and enriched the lower levels. In the Shishui, Caihe, and Lanxi communes alone, more than 3,600 cadres have recently been transferred to the management districts and production teams.
    The greatest characteristic of Hubei Province's transfer of cadres downwards and enrichment of the grassroots this year is the widespread implementation of a responsibility system based on segmented contracting and accountability to the end. Some areas have also adopted methods of contracting at each level and being responsible at each level, fixing responsibility areas and implementing "year-round contracting and monthly contracting." Taking Hongan County as an example, in this county, from the secretary to the committee members, all have contracted to the communes by segments, the commune party committee members contract to the management districts, and the management district cadres contract to the production teams. At the same time, the county also transferred more than 1,500 cadres to serve as production team leaders. In this county, whether they are leading cadres or general cadres, they all implement the "three-package" responsibility system of contracting districts, contracting production tasks, and contracting the completion of various tasks. In order to ensure the effective implementation of this system, the county has specifically stipulated four systems: first, there is year-round contracting for the year, monthly contracting for the month, semi-monthly inspection, monthly evaluation, quarterly summary and model evaluation, and merit awards at the end of the year; second, going deep into the fields, going deep among the masses, one to two mu of experimental fields per person, and one experimental canteen per person; third, meetings and discussions are held on site, and brigades generally do not hold telephone conferences, and meetings for the masses do not exceed two hours; fourth, ensuring two hours of study, studying and entertaining with the masses. Many areas have adopted similar practices to Hongan County while transferring cadres downwards and enriching the grassroots. For example, Shishui County has implemented a "five-determination" responsibility system among all cadres in the county. The five determinations are to determine the area, determine the task, determine the time, determine the work points, and determine the rewards and punishments. After the implementation of the responsibility system based on segmented contracting and accountability to the end, the cadres' sense of responsibility has been greatly strengthened, and their work enthusiasm and initiative have been brought into play. The situation of unclear division of labor and unclear responsibility in the past has been reduced, and the new situation is: "Cadres have a bottom line, work has a direction, production is taken the lead in, and difficulties are taken on by themselves."
    Judging from the situations reflected by various places, due to the adoption of transferring cadres downwards at all levels and implementing the responsibility system of segmented contracting and accountability to the end, the cadres' work style is undergoing profound changes. Many areas are carrying out competitions centered on changing work styles and closely linking with the masses. For example, Xianyang County has launched a "five-together," "four-take-the-lead," and "four-have" competition movement among all cadres in the county. The so-called five-together means eating, living, laboring, studying, and discussing with the masses; the four-take-the-lead means taking the lead in hard work, taking the lead in innovation, taking the lead in overcoming difficulties, and family members of cadres taking the lead in production; the four-have means having a labor handbook, having production tools, having experimental fields, and having key points; in addition, it also advocates that cadres pick up manure while walking, hold more field meetings, do more publicity, make inspections and evaluations regularized, and participate in production regularized. In this way, large-scale experimental fields, eating, living, and laboring with the masses have become a common practice. In Yunmeng County, out of more than 9,800 cadres, more than 9,300 participated in planting experimental fields, and they carried forward the experience of planting experimental fields last year, from single experiments to diverse experiments, from small-scale experiments to large-scale experiments. Under the influence of cadres taking the lead in planting experimental fields, in some areas, planting experimental fields has become a grand mass movement.
    At present, the relationship between the vast number of cadres and the masses in this province is closer, and their enthusiasm is greater. They are carrying out a comprehensive spring plowing movement centered on accumulating fertilizer. According to statistics, as of now, more than 15 billion dan of fertilizer have been accumulated. At the same time, achievements have also been made in water conservancy construction, deep plowing, repairing farm tools, drying seeds, and strengthening the breeding of cattle. Many commune members reflected: "Cadres have contracted, work has gone to the fields, as long as we do this, we can guarantee increased production."

    加强第一线的领导力量
    湖南近万名县以上机关干部下放担任公社领导工作
    湖北在农村干部中推行分片包干负责到底的责任制
    本报讯　为了巩固提高人民公社、力争今年更大的跃进，湖南省下放大批干部，加强人民公社的领导力量。
    人民公社开始建立时，湖南省各级党委就十分注意加强人民公社的干部配备。全省一千一百零六个公社的党委书记，一般都由原来的区主要干部担任，其中有30％是县委委员或相当于县委一级的干部。为了适应更大跃进的需要，最近又从县以上机关抽调了九千四百多名干部，加强公社领导力量，其中省常委三人、省委委员二人、部厅局长九人、地委书记九人、地委委员二十六人、省直处长、地委部长四十八人、县委书记一百零四人、县委委员三百三十八人、县科局长级一千零四十二人。这些干部一般都兼任公社党委书记、大队总支书记。
    公社、大队的干部也普遍层层下放，加强基层生产队的领导力量。保靖东风人民公社四十七个干部，除留六人在机关掌握日常工作外，其他都固定到点，深入到生产队。公社党委要求人人搞好五个试验，即：试验管理好一个生产队，一个公共食堂，一个工厂，一个猪牛圈，一亩试验田。每个干部做到七好：即工作深入完成任务好；发扬民主，群众路线工作方法好；关心群众生活，帮助群众解决困难好；思想进步，努力学习好；服从领导，组织纪律好；技术革新，创造发明好；试验田搞得好。桃江超英公社干部下放后，和群众一道大搞试验田，清塘大队一百五十三个社队干部，带领四百多个社员，搞了一千三百多亩试验田，全部深耕一尺以上，每亩积肥已达八百多担。
    本报讯　记者田庄报道：为了进一步组织生产高潮，湖北许多地区正采取一项重要措施，即层层下放干部，推行分片包干、负责到底的责任制度，从而加强第一线领导，保证全面实现1959年更大跃进。
    干部下放，充实基层，是湖北省去年取得丰收的主要经验之一。人民公社建立初期，由于缺乏经验，公社一级的干部较多。随着人民公社的整顿巩固和提高，各级党委根据八届六中全会的精神，普遍精简了机构，下放干部，充实了下层。仅浠水县十月、蔡河、兰溪等公社，最近下放到管理区、生产队的干部就达三千六百多人。
    湖北省今年下放干部、充实基层的最大特点是：普遍推行了分片包干、负责到底的责任制度。有些地区还采取了层层包干、层层负责的方法，固定责任地区，实行“长年包干，分月包干”。以红安县为例，这个县从书记到委员都已分片包干到公社，公社党委委员包干到管理区，管理区干部包干到生产队。和这同时，全县还抽调了一千五百多名干部下放当生产队长。在这个县，无论是领导干部还是一般干部，都实行了包地区、包生产任务、包完成各项工作的“三包”责任制度。为了使这一制度得以切实执行，全县具体规定了四项制度：一，年有年包干，月有月包干，半月一检查，一月一评比，一季总结一评模，年终立功受奖；二，深入田间，深入群众，一人一至两亩试验田，一人一个试验食堂；三，开会碰头到现场，大队一般不开电话会，群众开会不过两小时；四，保证学习两小时，与群众同学习同娱乐。许多地区在抽调干部下放、充实基层的同时，大都采取了与红安县类似的作法。例如浠水县就在全县干部中推行了“五定”责任制度。五定是定地区、定任务、定时间、定工分和定奖惩。推行分片包干、负责到底的责任制度以后，大大加强了干部的责任心，发挥了工作积极性和主动性。过去那种分工不明，责任不清的情况少了，而出现的新情况是：“干部有了底，工作有方向，生产带头干，困难自己当。”
    从各地反映的情况看，由于采取了层层下放干部，推行分片包干，负责到底的责任制度，目前，干部作风正发生着深刻变化。许多地区正开展以转变工作作风、密切联系群众为中心内容的竞赛。例如，沔阳县就在全县干部中开展了“五同”、“四带头”、“四有”的竞赛运动。所谓五同就是与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同商量；四带头是带头苦干、带头革新、带头克服困难、干部家属带头生产；四有是有劳动手册、有生产工具、有试验田、有重点；另外还提倡干部走路拣粪、多开田头会、多作宣传、检查评比经常化、参加生产经常化等。这样一来，大搞试验田，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动，蔚然成风。云梦县九千八百多名干部，参加种试验田的就有九千三百多人，并且发扬了去年种试验田的经验，由单一试验发展到多种多样试验，由小面积试验到大面积试验。在干部带头种试验田的影响下，有些地区种试验田已经成为规模壮阔的群众运动。
    目前，这个省广大干部和群众之间的关系更密切了，干劲更大了，他们正在全省范围内开展着一个以积肥造肥为中心的全面备耕运动。据统计，截至目前止，已经积肥一百五十多亿担。和这同时，兴修水利、深翻土地、整修农具、翻晒种籽以及加强饲养耕牛等，都已取得不小成绩。许多社员反映说：“干部包了干，工作下了田，只要这样干，保证能增产。”
