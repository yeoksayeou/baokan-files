Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, February 4th. The Iraqi government continues to release information from the Supreme Special Military Court's secret trial of former Deputy Prime Minister Arif, who is accused of treasonous conspiracy. After the Attorney General Amin presented the indictment, many witnesses testified to Arif's crimes.

Brigadier General Muhyi al-Din Abdul Hamid, commander of the Fourth Division and a leading member of the "Free Officers Group" before the revolution, testified that the Free Officers had discussed "the issue of relations with the United Arab Republic before the revolution. We unanimously agreed that neither a federation nor complete merger should be organized under the current circumstances. We emphasized Arab unity. After a transitional period, the people could make their own decisions. However, the defendant continuously undermined this decision and demanded immediate unification, thus violating the officers' oath."

Witness Brigadier General Fadl Arif of Karbala testified that the officers unanimously believed that no factions should be formed after the revolution and that the unity of the Iraqi people must be maintained to defend the Republic. However, the defendant "undermined this decision, colluded with the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party, organized factions, and provoked the other side, causing division within the Iraqi people."

Another witness, Lieutenant Colonel Abdul Karim Jiddeh, commander of the Military Police, also testified that the defendant supported the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party, violated the officers' agreement, and caused division within the people. He testified that he had heard that when the defendant met President Nasser in Damascus, he told Nasser: "I am ready to merge Iraq with the UAR." When Nasser asked about Prime Minister Qasim's attitude, the defendant allegedly said: "Qasim will be like Muhammad Naguib." (Naguib was the leader of the Egyptian officers' "Revolutionary Command Council," who served as President and Prime Minister after overthrowing the Farouk dynasty and was later dismissed.)

Witness Wasfi Taher, Prime Minister Qasim's bodyguard, testified that the defendant showed disrespect for the Iraqi people because he repeatedly said: "Who are the people? We rule the people, we command the people with our feet." Taher also said that the defendant often called everyone who disagreed with him a communist. He tried to exclude officers who did not recognize his leadership so that he could control and rule Iraq in a dictatorial manner.

Witness Fadl Arif was in the same room with Prime Minister Qasim and the defendant when the defendant attempted to assassinate the Prime Minister. He described the defendant's attempt to assassinate Qasim as he witnessed it. He said, "I saw Arif put his hand on the trigger of his revolver, and the Prime Minister bent down and tightly grabbed his hands around his waist, preventing him from moving the revolver." The witness added that he jumped up, took the revolver from the defendant, and handed it to the Prime Minister. Two other witnesses to the incident also corroborated his testimony.

Witness Lieutenant Colonel Jiddeh also testified that the defendant had personally told Jiddeh that he "hoped the imperialists would benefit." The defendant also told him, "I should have gone to Fallujah (about fifty kilometers west of Baghdad) on the morning of the revolution instead of carrying out the plan. Now I feel regret and remorse, and I pay tribute to the soul of Nuri al-Said and pray for him."

On the evening of February 2nd, the Iraqi Republic Radio also broadcast the testimony of more witnesses summoned by the military court. These witnesses included Brigadier General Abdul Aziz, commander of the First Division, and Brigadier General Nazim Tabakshali, commander of the Second Division, among others. They all confirmed the testimonies made at the previous trial. Only Minister of Social Affairs Naji Talib attempted to defend Arif in his testimony.

    伊拉克继续公布审讯叛国案情况
    阿里夫罪证如山
    新华社巴格达4日电　伊拉克政府继续公布了最高特别军事法庭秘密审讯阴谋叛国分子前副总理阿里夫的情况。在总检察官阿明提出起诉以后，许多证人证实了阿里夫的罪行。
    第四师师长、革命前的“自由军官集团”的领导成员毛希丁·阿卜杜勒·哈米德准将证明，革命前自由军官曾经讨论了“同阿拉伯联合共和国的关系问题，我们一致认为，在目前情况下既不应该组织联邦，也不应该完全合并，我们强调了阿拉伯团结。在我们经过一段过渡时期以后，人民就可以自己来作出决定。但是，被告不断地破坏这个决定，要求立即统一；这样就违背了军官们的誓约”。
    证人、克尔巴拉地方的法德·阿里夫准将证明，军官们当时一致认为：革命以后不应该成立集团，为了保卫共和国，必须维持伊拉克人民的团结。但是被告“破坏了这个决定，和阿拉伯复兴社会党勾结在一起，组织集团，向另一方挑衅，造成了伊拉克人民内部的分裂”。
    另一个证人、宪兵队长阿卜杜勒·卡里姆·杰德赫中校也证明，被告支持阿拉伯复兴社会党，破坏了军官们的协议，造成了人民内部的分裂。他证明，他听说，被告在大马士革遇见纳赛尔总统的时候曾经对纳赛尔说：“我准备使伊拉克和阿联合并。”当纳赛尔问到卡塞姆总理的态度时，据说被告曾经说：“卡塞姆将要像穆罕默德·纳吉布一样。”（纳吉布是埃及军官“革命指导委员会”的领袖，在推翻了法鲁克王朝以后曾任总统兼总理，后来被解职。）
    证人、卡塞姆总理的警卫长瓦斯菲·塔赫尔证明，被告对伊拉克人民不尊重，因为他曾多次说过：“谁是人民呢？我们统治人民，我们用我们的脚指挥人民。”塔赫尔还说，被告经常把每一个和他意见不同的人叫做共产党人。他曾经设法排斥那些不承认他的领导的军官，这样他就可以用专制的方法来控制和统治伊拉克。
    证人法德·阿里夫在被告企图暗杀总理的时候，曾和卡塞姆总理与被告在一个房间里。他描述了他亲眼看见的被告企图暗杀卡塞姆的经过。他说，他“看见阿里夫把手放在左轮枪的扳机上，总理正屈下身紧紧地抓住他放在腰上的双手。不让他动左轮枪。”证人又说，他跳了起来，从被告那里拿走了左轮枪，然后把它交给了总理。另外两个目击这个事件的证人也证实了他的证词。
    证人杰德赫中校还证明，被告曾经亲口对杰德赫说过他“希望帝国主义者得到好处”的话。被告还对他说，“我本来应该在革命的那天早晨走到费留雅（巴格达西约五十公里）去，而不去执行计划。现在我感到遗憾和后悔，我向努里·赛义德的灵魂致敬并为他祈祷”。
    伊拉克共和国电台2日晚上还广播了军事法庭召唤的更多的证人的证词。这些证人包括第一师师长阿卜杜勒·阿齐兹准将，第二师师长纳齐姆·塔巴克沙利准将等人。他们都证实了上次审判所作的证词。只有社会事务部长纳吉·塔列布在证词中企图为阿里夫辩解。
