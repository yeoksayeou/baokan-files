Eliminate Pests and Diseases, Welcome the New Year
The Broad Masses Throughout the Country Enthusiastically Launch a Patriotic Health Campaign

(Our Dispatch) A high tide of the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating pests and diseases is gradually forming across the country. The broad masses are throwing themselves into this movement with full confidence, determined to greet the New Year with even greater achievements.

Combining rectification of the communes and relying on the advantageous conditions of the communes to carry out pest and disease elimination work on the basis of unified thinking is one of the characteristics of the current health work. Some cadres and masses in Cheng Guan Commune in Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province, once believed that production tasks were heavy and there was no time for sanitation work. Before launching the pest and disease elimination campaign, this commune clarified this thinking in conjunction with the commune rectification work, making everyone realize that doing a good job in sanitation work can ensure a greater leap forward in production. At the same time, it arranged time for sanitation work according to the specific situation. Now, not only is the commune clean everywhere, but it has also increased a large amount of fertilizer. After the broad masses of cadres and people in the Red Flag People's Commune in Wangcang County, Sichuan, realized the importance of carrying out sanitation work, they eliminated many pests, harmful birds, and harmful animals in twenty days, dredged and sorted out all the open and closed ditches, filled in and blocked useless manure pits and ponds, and every household carried out cleaning. They also built more than 760 public toilets and more than 2,800 garbage pits, giving the commune's environmental sanitation a new look.

The current pest and disease elimination work is more closely combined with the current crash program to accumulate fertilizer in agricultural production. Each county in the Yangzhou Special District of Jiangsu Province closely combined pest and disease elimination with winter production, deploying more than 20 tractors and more than 500 winches, and organized more than 7,200 people to join the battle to eliminate snails in conjunction with plowing the land. The Liuzhou Special District of Guangxi combined the construction of water conservancy projects, deep plowing, and fertilizer accumulation to carry out snail eradication work. Luocheng County mobilized tractors to reclaim wasteland and eradicate snails, digging many irrigation ditches, accumulating more than 4 million dan of fertilizer, and also achieved the requirements for snail eradication. Incomplete statistics from four special districts and one city in Shanxi Province show that in the past ten days, sanitary fertilizer accumulation reached more than 18 million tons.

In this crash campaign, all localities paid more attention to the combination of fundamental and symptomatic treatment and the elimination of dead corners. During the campaign, not only were efforts made to eliminate the remaining overwintering four pests, but attention was also paid to blocking rat holes, mud sparrow nests, digging out pupae and smashing pupae, improving toilets, livestock pens, and wells, filling in sewage pits and puddles, renovating ditches and sewers, and clearing garbage. In conjunction with the pest and disease elimination campaign, various parts of Henan vigorously improved environmental sanitation, cleared a lot of garbage and feces, promoted mud-sealed composting, carried out toilet construction and renovation, livestock pen infrastructure construction, and universally dug out pupae and smashed pupae, seizing the opportunity to eliminate mosquito and fly breeding grounds. Xi'an City mobilized the broad masses to encircle and suppress rats and sparrows, eliminating more than 160,000 rats and 320,000 sparrows in a few days. Hangzhou City launched a comprehensive campaign to encircle and suppress sparrows, and in conjunction with eliminating field mice, eliminated more than 160,000 sparrows and more than 79,000 field mice in two days. Many places also used smoke to kill mosquitoes and flies.

In the campaign, all localities have made the elimination of diseases, especially winter infectious diseases, one of the key points. In the prevention and treatment of diseases, publicity, inspection, and epidemic reporting have been universally strengthened, measures such as regional contracting responsibility and mobile prevention and treatment have been adopted, and emphasis has been placed on doing a good job in prevention, isolation, nursing, and medicine supply. Thirty-five counties and cities in Gansu Province have controlled the spread of winter infectious diseases. Rong County and Xing'an County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have basically eradicated diseases such as influenza. In some areas of Beijing, the spread of measles has been controlled. During the campaign, many areas also paid attention to ensuring the quality of pest and disease elimination work. (Xu Wei)

    除害灭病  迎接新春
    全国广大群众热烈展开爱国卫生运动
    本报讯  目前一个以除害灭病为中心的爱国卫生运动高潮，正在全国范围内逐渐形成。广大群众正满怀信心投入这一运动，他们决心以更大的成绩迎接新春。
    结合整社，依靠公社的有利条件，在统一思想的基础上开展除害灭病工作，是当前卫生工作的特点之一。陕西蒲城县城关公社部分干部和群众曾经认为生产任务重，没有时间搞卫生工作。这个公社在开展除害灭病运动之前，结合整社工作澄清了这种思想，使大家认识到做好卫生工作可以保证生产更大的跃进，同时，根据具体情况安排了搞卫生的时间。现在这个公社不但到处干干净净，还增加了大量肥料。四川旺苍县红旗人民公社广大干部和群众认识到开展卫生工作的重要性后，二十天里就消灭了许多害虫、害鸟、害兽，疏通和整理了所有的阴沟、阳沟，填平堵塞了无用的粪坑粪池，家家户户都进行了扫除，还修建了七百六十多个公共厕所和二千八百多个垃圾坑，使公社环境卫生面貌焕然一新。
    目前的除害灭病工作，和当前农业生产上的突击积肥运动更加密切的结合起来了。江苏扬州专区各县紧密结合冬季生产除害灭病，调配了二十多部拖拉机，五百多部绞关犁，组织七千二百多人结合翻地投入消灭钉螺的战斗。广西柳州专区结合兴修水利、深耕、积肥开展灭螺工作，罗城县调动了拖拉机垦荒灭螺，开挖了许多灌溉沟渠，积肥四百余万担，还达到了灭螺的要求。山西四个专区一个市的不完全统计，最近十天内积卫生肥达一千八百余万吨。
    在这次突击运动中，各地更加注意了治本治标结合和消灭死角。运动中，不仅大力消灭残存越冬四害，同时注意了堵鼠洞，泥雀窝，挖蛹砸蛹，改良厕所、畜圈、水井，填平污水坑洼，整修沟渠下水道，清除垃圾等工作。河南各地结合除害灭病运动，大力改进环境卫生，清除了许多垃圾粪便，推广泥封堆肥，进行厕所修建改建、牲畜栏圈基本建设，并普遍挖蛹砸蛹，抓紧消灭蚊蝇孳生地。西安市动员广大群众围剿鼠雀，在几天内就消灭了老鼠十六万多只，麻雀三十二万只。杭州市开展全面围剿麻雀活动，并结合消灭田鼠，两天灭雀十六万多只，灭田鼠七万九千余只。许多地方还采用了烟熏灭蚊蝇的办法。
    各地在运动中，都把消灭疾病，特别是消灭冬季传染病的工作，作为重点之一。在防治疾病工作中，普遍加强了宣传、检查、疫情报告，采用地区包干负责、巡回防治等措施，并强调作好预防、隔离、护理和药材供应工作。甘肃省已有三十五个县市控制了冬季传染病的流行。广西僮族自治区的容县、兴安等县已基本扑灭了流行性感冒等疾病。北京市的一些地区，已经控制了麻疹的流行。在运动中，许多地区还注意保证除害灭病工作的质量。（徐威）
