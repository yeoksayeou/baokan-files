Xinhua News Agency, February 12th, Tokyo dispatch: More than thirty Japanese groups today established the "National Congress Implementation Committee to Break the Security Treaty System and Restore Japan-China Diplomatic Relations" in Tokyo.

    At its first meeting today, the Implementation Committee formally decided to hold the "National Congress to Break the Security Treaty System and Restore Japan-China Diplomatic Relations" in Tokyo on February 28th.

    This Implementation Committee was initiated by six groups, including the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, the National Federation for the Defense of the Constitution, the National Liaison Council Against Military Bases, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Joint Struggle Council for Peace and Democracy. Currently, in addition to these six groups, the participating groups include the Coal Miners' Union, the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union, the Private Railway Workers' Union Confederation, the All-Japan Shipbuilding Workers' Union, the Japan Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the Peace Committee, the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association, the International Trade Promotion Association, the Japan-Soviet Association, the Japan-Korea Association, the Democratic Youth League, the National Federation of Commercial and Industrial Organizations, and a total of thirty-seven groups. The number of participating groups is still increasing.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 12th, Tokyo dispatch: Japanese labor movement leader Minoru Takano published an article in the Japan-China Friendship Association's organ "Japan and China" on February 11th, pointing out that in order for the Japanese people to open the door to breaking the deadlock in Japan-China relations, they must launch a struggle against the Nobusuke Kishi government's policy of hostility towards China. At the same time, they must carry out a struggle against U.S. imperialism through the movement to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and strive for independence.

    Takano said that the Nobusuke Kishi government has not only failed to take measures that accommodate China's opinions regarding the restoration of Japan-China relations, but on the contrary, it is stepping up the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." He pointed out that under these circumstances, it is wrong to harbor illusions about the easing of current Japan-China relations. Takano believes that the recent uproar in the Japanese commercial newspapers regarding the issue of Japan-China relations is a conspiracy by the Nobusuke Kishi government to divert people's attention to Japan-China relations in order to establish a Japanese nuclear armament system. It also shows that these newspapers are undertaking the task of leading the upcoming House of Councillors election in a way that is favorable to the Liberal Democratic Party on behalf of Kishi.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 12th, Tokyo dispatch: Miyazaki Seimin, a standing director of the Japan-China Friendship Association, published an article in today's "Asahi Shimbun" pointing out that some of the recent remarks made by the Nobusuke Kishi government regarding the improvement of Japan-China relations are tactics to cope with the upcoming House of Councillors and local elections and to curry favor with voters.

    Miyazaki said that judging from Kishi's statements, he has not reflected at all on the responsibility he should bear for the severance of Japan-China relations and the ensuing deadlock. Miyazaki accused the Nobusuke Kishi government of further actively revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and stepping up its collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique since the beginning of this year. Miyazaki pointed out that judging from these phenomena, the conditions for easing Japan-China relations do not currently exist.

    The "Hokkaido Shimbun" published an editorial on the 5th, saying that the Nobusuke Kishi government, which has always promoted a policy of hostility towards China to the Japanese people, has recently suddenly changed its attitude, expressing its willingness to promote Japan-China trade with a "smile on its lips," which must be for a reason. The newspaper pointed out that Kishi's stance is a countermeasure to deal with the upcoming elections. In fact, Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama had previously stated to Tadashi Adachi, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry: "The statement regarding the convening of talks between the ambassadors of Japan and China is mostly propaganda for the countermeasures for the House of Councillors election."

    The editorial pointed out that if the Nobusuke Kishi government wants to use the issue of restoring Japan-China trade as a means to benefit itself in the election, then the policy towards China that it has been promoting single-mindedly recently can only harm the adjustment of Japan-China relations and does not have any benefits.

    粉碎日美“安全条约”要求恢复日中邦交
    日本数十团体决定联合斗争
    高野实等指责岸政府继续奉行敌视中国的政策
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本三十多个团体今天在东京成立了“打破安全条约体系、恢复日中邦交国民大会实行委员会”。
    实行委员会在今天举行的第一次会议上正式决定，将于2月28日在东京举行“打破安全条约体系、恢复日中邦交国民大会”。
    这个实行委员会是由日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会、日本工会总评议会、恢复日中邦交国民会议、拥护宪法国民联合会、全国反对军事基地联络会议和东京都维护和平与民主共同斗争会议等六个团体倡议组织的。目前，参加实行委员会的除了这六个团体以外，还有煤矿工会、全递信工会、私营铁道工会总联合会、全日本造船工会、日本工会促进国际贸易协议会、和平委员会、日中友好协会、日中贸易促进会、国际贸易促进协会、日苏协会、日朝协会、民主青年同盟、全国商工团体联合会等共三十七个团体。参加的团体现在还在继续增加中。
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本工人运动领袖高野实在11日出版的日中友好协会机关报“日本和中国”上发表文章指出，日本人民要打开日中关系僵局的大门，必须展开斗争反对岸信介政府敌视中国的政策，同时必须通过争取废除日美“安全条约”的运动，展开反对美帝国主义的斗争，为争取独立而奋斗。
    高野实说，岸信介政府对于恢复日中关系不仅没有采取适应中国方面的意见的措施，而且相反地正在加紧修改日美“安全条约”。他指出，在这种情况下，对目前日中关系会缓和寄于幻想是错误的。高野实认为，日本商业报纸最近关于日中关系问题的喧嚷，是岸信介政府为了建立日本核武装体系而企图把人民的注意转移到日中关系方面的阴谋，同时也表明这些报纸替岸信介承担了把即将举行的参议员选举导致有利于自由民主党的任务。
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会常任理事宫崎世民在今天的“朝日新闻”上发表文章指出，岸信介政府最近发表的一些关于改善日中关系的言论都是为了应付即将举行的参议员和地方选举，讨好选民的一种策略。
    宫崎说，从岸信介的发言来看，他对于使日中关系断绝而陷入僵局应负的责任，一点也没有进行反省。宫崎指责今年以来岸信介政府进一步积极修改日美“安全条约”并加紧同蒋介石集团勾结的态度。宫崎指出，从这些现象看来，目前并不具备日中关系缓和的条件。
    “北海道新闻”曾经在5日发表社论说，最近一向对日本人民宣传敌视中国政策的岸信介政府突然改变态度，在“嘴唇上含着微笑”表示要促进日中贸易，这一定是有原因的。这家报纸指出，岸信介的这种姿态是为了应付即将到来的选举的一种对策。事实上，在不久以前，外务相藤山爱一郎曾经对日本商工会议所会长足立正表明：“关于召开日中两国大使会谈的发言，那是大部分为了参议员选举对策的宣传”。
    社论指出，如果岸信介政府想把恢复日中贸易问题作为在选举中有利于它自己的手段，那末最近以来它一意宣传的对中国的政策，对于调整日中关系只有害处而没有一点好处。
