Fight for Long and Large Ears of Wheat with Abundant and Full Grains

    More than ten days ago, we published an editorial discussing the crucial stage of wheat turning green. Judging from the information reflected at the recent wheat symposium held in Zhengzhou with representatives from ten provinces and cities, most regions have strengthened field management of wheat, and the battle to overcome the "turning green" stage has achieved significant success. This is another victory in the effort to achieve a bumper wheat harvest this year. On this basis, there is great hope for achieving a large wheat harvest. However, to turn hope into reality and secure the harvest, in addition to continuing efforts to achieve a thorough victory in overcoming the "turning green" stage, we must prepare for the next step early, exert great effort, improve technology, and bravely and skillfully overcome several more important hurdles. The current urgent task is to fight for long and large ears of wheat with abundant and full grains!
    "The three treasures of wheat harvest: many heads, large ears, and full grains." Wheat yield is composed of several factors: number of plants, number of ears, number of grains, and grain weight. Currently, general wheat fields have about 500,000 plants or more, which has already secured the number of plants needed for a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin. This is a good foundation. On this basis, as long as we continue to strengthen field management and ensure sufficient water and fertilizer, it is possible to guarantee long and large ears with abundant and full grains. Conversely, if we relax our efforts and vigilance, and if the wheat suffers from dehydration or nutrient deficiency midway, even if we have successfully passed the "turning green" stage, we will still fail to achieve our expected results in the end.

    Ensuring that each ear is long and large, and that each grain is full, striving for one ear to be equivalent to two, and one grain to be equivalent to two, is a key measure to ensure a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin and strive for 1,500 jin. We must mobilize the broad masses of farmers, pool their wisdom and efforts, and strive to overcome this hurdle.

    To ensure long and large ears, we must successfully pass the jointing and heading stage. A wheat ear is composed of many spikelets; each spikelet is composed of several florets; and each floret, after fertilization, grows well and develops into a grain of wheat. Long and large ears mean increasing the number of fertile spikelets on each wheat ear and increasing the number of fertile florets within each spikelet. After wheat begins to joint, the already differentiated and shaped primordial ear gradually grows, which is called ear development. Soon, the ear emerges from the leaf sheath, which is called heading. This is the time when wheat needs the most and most urgent supply of nutrients. If nutrients are lacking, some florets will be infertile (will not produce grains). If we continue to supply fertilizer steadily after the "turning green" stage management, we can improve the spikelet setting rate and reduce the number of infertile florets, achieving the goal of long and large ears. During the jointing and heading stage, the quality and variety of fertilizers should be better and more diverse. During this period, quick-acting fertilizers should be applied; we must not only attach importance to the application of nitrogen fertilizer, but also apply phosphorus and potassium fertilizers in combination (these two fertilizers are most closely related to grain quantity and strong stalks). The jointing and heading stage of wheat is also the time when water is most urgently needed. In northern regions, we must be vigilant against drought and irrigate appropriately and timely; in southern wheat fields, we must prevent spring rain from causing waterlogging and do a good job of clearing ditches and draining water.

    Fertilizer and water are still the central links in wheat field management during this period. To achieve a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin, we must apply more fertilizer and irrigate frequently. However, crops are organic entities, and under certain conditions and during a certain period, their need for water and fertilizer has a certain limit; just as people should eat at fixed times and in fixed quantities. If watering and topdressing are not done properly in the later stages of wheat growth, it can easily lead to excessive growth and lodging. We must not only be full of confidence and determined to win 1,000 jin, but also realize that achieving a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin is not easy. We must not only have sufficient material preparations for striving for a bumper harvest, but also use these preparations at the most appropriate time. This requires us to pay close attention to learning and mastering the corresponding technologies, and to closely integrate hard work with skillful work. The most important thing is to carefully study and fully utilize the experiences of high wheat yields in various places last year, and apply them flexibly and creatively according to this year's different conditions and the different situations in various places, striving to: observe the sky, the land, and the crops, and carefully observe every moment; apply fertilizer skillfully according to the period and classification; and irrigate skillfully in a timely and appropriate amount.

    During this period, we must also pay close attention to late frost damage. In mid-April 1953, approximately 100 million mu of wheat fields in the Huang-Huai region suffered from late frost, resulting in a loss of about 7 billion jin of wheat. This is a lesson worth remembering. According to this year's weather forecast, the end date of late frost may be delayed compared to previous years. Therefore, we must raise our vigilance and strengthen frost prevention forecasts. In case of frost, we must use the favorable conditions after communization to fully prevent and rescue.

    To ensure abundant and full grains, we must successfully pass the flowering and grain-filling stage. After wheat flowering and fertilization, the number of grains set on each wheat ear is fixed. At this time, the nutrients accumulated in the stems and leaves are transported in large quantities to the grains, and the milky white liquid in the grains gradually increases, which is called grain filling. In plants, the transport of nutrients must rely on "water transport." Therefore, the grain-filling period is the time when wheat needs the most water in its life. Insufficient moisture and poor nutrient transport will affect grain filling and result in poorly filled grains. We must irrigate the three stages of flowering, grain filling, and grain ripening well according to the climate, soil, and wheat growth conditions, so as to promote sufficient grain filling and full grains. Especially in areas prone to dry winds, it is necessary to seize the opportunity to irrigate and prevent shriveled grains.

    The application of fertilizer in the later stage of wheat, especially nitrogen fertilizer, has always been controversial. During the flowering and grain-filling period, should we apply topdressing? Scientific tests have proved that wheat's absorption of nitrogen often continues until maturity. To achieve a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin and higher yields, we must continuously supply nutrients according to the needs of wheat growth. For the sake of full and strong grains, quick-acting fertilizers should be applied appropriately before and after grain filling according to the growth of wheat seedlings. At this time, special attention should be paid to the application of some phosphate fertilizer, and foliar fertilization (spraying with liquid fertilizer) can be used so that wheat plants can absorb quickly.

    Close attention to the prevention and control of pests and diseases is one of the important management tasks during the wheat growing process. Various wheat rusts and scab are important disasters that hinder the fullness of wheat grains. Wheat rust occurred early this year and has the potential to develop seriously, so we must be vigilant. Last year, various places implemented the method of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and vigorously eliminated rust as soon as it occurred. This experience should be cherished and promoted. We should also strengthen the inspection of wheat gall midge and immediately seize the opportunity to prevent and control it in time when it is found.

    To ensure a bumper harvest, we must also successfully pass the maturity and harvest stage. This is the last hurdle, but it must not be ignored in the slightest. We must remember the lessons of "the last ten li of a hundred-li journey are half the journey" and "building a mountain to nine ren, falling short by one basket." We need to master the most appropriate time for harvesting and concentrate the power of the commune to fight the battle of "seizing food from the dragon's mouth." Currently, the most important thing is to prepare for summer harvesting tools.

    Passing these few hurdles is determined by the inherent growth laws of wheat. To ensure high and abundant wheat yields, we must successfully pass one hurdle after another and continue to fight. There is no easy shortcut to bypass this. Our slogan is: advance steadily, increase efforts, attack fiercely, strive for perfection, seize every moment, and value every second. To achieve this goal, we must do a good job in training, command, logistics, supply, and other tasks, and truly ensure that there are people when needed, fertilizer when needed, water when needed, tools when needed, medicine and machinery when needed, and technology when needed. For the water and fertilizer needed for each stage of wheat growth and development, we must carefully calculate, make plans, prepare in advance, and deliver them to the fields in time. Of course, we must also make corresponding plans for labor force arrangements and technology promotion plans for each period.

    The focus of the current large-scale, high-yield wheat competition should be placed on striving for long and large ears and abundant and full grains. For how many plants per mu, how many ears can be guaranteed, how many grains per ear, and how much weight per thousand grains, we must conduct actual measurements and calculations, and formulate specific goals and slogans for struggle. In this way, we can not only put the plan to strive for a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin or more on a solid and reliable basis, but also make cadres and the masses more confident in achieving this great goal. Throughout the entire production process, we must continuously organize several battles rhythmically; winning each battle will pave the way for winning the final victory. The wheat seedlings are still small, and there are about three months from greening to harvesting. There are still several hurdles to overcome on the road to final victory; if the leadership is relaxed, even with better wheat seedlings, a bumper harvest cannot be obtained. The current objective conditions are very good; whether the ending is good or bad mainly depends on people's subjective efforts. Therefore, we must continue to strengthen political and ideological work, and constantly overcome both right-leaning conservative thinking and complacency and paralysis. Enthusiasm must be constantly encouraged, and the more encouraged, the higher it will be; the responsibility system for field management must be constantly grasped, and the tighter it is grasped, the more detailed it will be. We must ensure that there are commanders on every road, generals in every direction, soldiers in every area, and everyone is responsible. We must seize high-yield fields to drive general fields, constantly eliminate third-class seedlings, and promote comprehensive bumper yields. We must also establish a file system for field management, regularly observe, record, analyze, and study, and constantly summarize and improve. In short, we must push forward the mass movement to strive for a greater summer harvest wave after wave; first strive for sufficient plants and sufficient ears per mu, then strive for ears that are long and large, then strive for grains that are full and strong, and then strive for harvests that are fast and clean. If each battle is won, the overall situation will be invincible.

    为穗长穗大、粒多粒饱而战
    十多天以前，我们曾经发表社论，谈到过好小麦返青关的问题。从最近期间在郑州举行的十省市小麦座谈会上反映的情况看来，绝大部分地区都加强了小麦的田间管理，攻打返青关的战斗已经取得了重大的成就。这是争取今年小麦丰收的又一次胜利。在这个基础上，争取小麦大丰收是大有希望的。但是，要使希望变成现实，使丰收到手，除了继续努力取得大破返青关的彻底胜利以外，还要及早为下一步作准备，鼓足干劲，提高技术，勇敢而又机智地再冲过几道重要关口。当前的紧急的任务，就是要为穗长穗大、粒多粒饱而战！
    “麦收三件宝：头多、穗大、籽粒饱”。小麦产量是由株数、穗数、粒数、粒重等几个因素构成的。现在，一般麦田都约有五十万株以上，已经争得了亩产千斤所需要的株数，这是一个很好的基础。在这个基础上，只要继续加强田间管理，水饱、肥足，就有可能保证穗长穗大粒多粒饱。反之，如果放松了战斗和戒备，中途脱水脱肥，即使已经过好了返青关，到头来仍然不能达到我们预期的结果。
    保证穗穗长大，粒粒饱满，力争一穗顶两穗，一粒顶两粒，这是保证亩产千斤、争取一千五百斤的关键措施。必须动员广大农民群众，群策群力，努力过好这一关。
    要确保穗长穗大，必须过好拔节抽穗关。小麦的穗是由许多小穗组成的；每一个小穗是由几个小花组成的；每个小花受孕之后长得好，就结成一粒麦籽。穗长穗大，就是使每个麦穗的结实小穗增大，每一小穗内结实的小花增多。小麦开始拔节以后，已经分化定型的穗的原始体逐渐长大，这就叫做孕穗；不久，穗就从叶鞘中钻出来，这就叫做抽穗。这时正是小麦需用养料最多最迫切的时候。如果缺少养分，有些小花就会不孕（不结籽）。如果紧接着返青期管理，源源不断地供应肥料，就能提高小穗结实率，减少不孕的小花数，达到穗长穗大的目的。在拔节抽穗期间，对肥料的质量和品种都要求更好更多样。在这期间，要施用速效性肥料；既要重视施用氮肥，还要配合施用磷质、钾质肥料（这两种肥料对于粒多、秆壮有最密切的关系）。小麦拔节抽穗时期，也是需水最迫切的时候。在北方地区，必须警惕干旱，适时适量地进行灌溉；南方麦田则要防止春雨成涝，作好清沟排水工作。
    肥和水仍是这一时期麦田管理的中心环节。要实现亩产千斤，必须多施肥、勤浇水。但是，作物是一个有机体，在一定条件下，在一定时期内，对于水和肥的需要有一定的限度；正和人吃饭应该定时定量一样。小麦到了生长后期，浇水追肥不当，往往容易引起徒长倒伏。我们既要满怀信心誓夺千斤，也要看到亩产千斤并非易事。既要有充足的争取大丰收的物质准备，还要把争取大丰收的物质准备用在最恰当的时机。这就必须十分注意学习和掌握相应的技术，做到苦干和巧干密切结合。最重要的就是要认真研究和充分运用去年各地小麦丰产的经验，按照今年不同的条件和各地的不同的情况，灵活地创造性地加以运用，力求做到：看天看地看庄稼，每时每刻细观察；按期分类巧施肥，应时适量巧浇水。
    在这个时期，还必须密切注意晚霜冻害。1953年4月中旬，黄淮地区约有一亿亩麦田遭到晚霜，损失小麦七十亿斤左右。这是一次值得记取的教训。根据今年气象预报，晚霜终止日期有可能比往年还要延迟。因此必须提高警惕，加强防霜预报。遇有霜冻，要运用公社化后的有利条件，全力防治和抢救。
    要确保粒多粒饱，则要过好扬花灌浆关。小麦开花受精以后，每一麦穗结实粒数已经固定。这时候茎叶中积累的养分大量运输到籽粒中，籽粒中乳白的浆液渐渐增多，这就叫做灌浆。在植物体内，养分的运输必须依靠“水运”。因此，灌浆期是小麦一生中需水最多的时候。水分不足，养分运输不畅，就会影响灌浆，结实不饱。必须根据气候土壤和小麦生长情况，浇好扬花、灌浆、催籽三道水，促使灌浆充足，结实饱满。尤其是容易遭受干风的地区，更要抓紧浇水，防止瘪粒。
    小麦后期施肥，特别是氮肥的施用，历来是有争论的。在扬花灌浆期，究竟要不要追肥呢？科学试验证明，小麦对氮素的吸收常持续到成熟的时候。要达到亩产千斤和更高的产量，必须根据小麦生长的需要，源源供应养料。为了粒饱粒壮，在灌浆前后，应该根据麦苗生长情况，适当地施用速效性肥料；这时，要特别注意施用一些磷肥，并可采用根外施肥（用液体肥料喷洒）的办法，使麦株能够迅速吸收。
    密切注意防止病虫为害，是小麦生长过程中重要管理工作之一。小麦各种锈病和赤霉病，是妨碍麦粒饱满的重要灾害。今年小麦锈病发生早，有严重发展的可能，必须提高警惕。去年各地实行土洋并举的办法，刚一发生锈病就大力扑灭。应该十分珍视这条经验，并加以推广。对小麦吸浆虫也要加强检查，发现了就立即抓紧时机及时防治。
    要确保丰产丰收，还要过好成熟收获关。这是最后一关，但是也一点不可忽视。要好好记取“行百里者半九十”、“为山九仞，功亏一篑”的教训。需要掌握收割的最恰当的时机，集中公社的力量，打好“龙口夺食”的战斗。目前，最要紧的是做好夏收工具的准备工作。
    过这几道关，是小麦本身的生长规律决定的。要确保小麦高产多收，就必须过好一关又一关，不断战斗，除此而外，是没有轻便的小路可以绕行的。我们的口号是：步步为营，劲上加劲，猛攻猛打，精益求精，时刻抓紧，分秒必争。要达到这个目的，必须把训练、指挥、后勤、供应等等工作都做好，真正作到要人有人，要肥有肥，要水有水，要工具有工具，要药械有药械，要技术有技术。对于小麦每一生长发育阶段所需要的水和肥，都要细致算账，订出计划，事先准备，及时到田。当然，也要相应地作好每个时期的劳动力的安排计划和技术推广计划。
    当前小麦大面积高产竞赛的中心，应该放在力争穗长穗大和粒多粒饱方面。对于一亩有多少株，可保多少穗，每穗多少粒，每千粒要有多重，都要经过实测和计算，规定具体的奋斗目标和行动口号。这样，既能把争取亩产千斤或千斤以上的计划放在切实可靠的基础上，也能使干部和群众对于实现这一伟大的目标更有信心。在整个生产过程中，要有节奏地连续组织几次战役；争取每一个战役的胜利，都是为争取最后胜利开辟道路。现在麦苗还小，从返青到收获还有三个月左右的时间，在走向最后胜利的大道上还有几道关要过；如果放松领导，纵有较好的麦苗，也不能获得丰收。目前的客观条件是很好的；结局是好是坏，主要决定于人们的主观努力。因此，必须继续加强政治思想工作，既要不断克服右倾保守思想，又要不断地和自满麻痹思想作斗争。干劲必须不断地鼓，越鼓越高；田间管理的责任制度必须不断地抓、越抓越细。要做到路路有帅，方方有将，片片有兵，人人有责。必须抓住高额丰产田，带动一般田，不断消灭三类苗，促进全面丰产。还要建立田间管理的档案制度，经常观察、记载、分析、研究，不断总结，不断提高。总之，要使争取夏季更大丰收的群众运动一浪更比一浪高地向前推进；先争取亩亩足株足穗，再争取穗穗又长又大，再争取粒粒又饱又壮，再争取收获又快又净。一个一个战役都胜利了，全局就立于不败之地。
