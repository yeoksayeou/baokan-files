    Miniature Cars Serving Passengers on the Streets
    The Shanghai-made miniature cars began a trial run before the Spring Festival. Like pedicabs, they can be hired at any time and place, charging only 15 fen per kilometer.
    Sewing a Pair of Shoe Soles in Three Minutes
    Cloth-soled shoes are economical, lightweight, and comfortable to wear, and are loved by the Chinese people. However, hand-sewing shoe soles is time-consuming and laborious.
    The Shanghai No. 1 Sewing Machine Factory has produced a "shoe sole sewing machine" specially for sewing shoe soles. This machine can rotate 400 revolutions per minute, and a pair of shoe soles can be sewn in less than three minutes. Its structure is solid, and it is equipped with a small electric motor, which can be powered by foot or electricity. It can be used in areas with or without power. The price of this machine is about the same as that of ordinary sewing machines.
    Silkworm Cocoon Covering Used to Make Special Medicine for Lung Disease
    Deqing County, Zhejiang Province, is vigorously promoting the comprehensive utilization of sericulture. More than 30 factories for the comprehensive utilization of sericulture have been established throughout the county. Ten major categories and 32 kinds of products, including cloth, paper, oil, medicine, and chemical preparations, have been officially put into production. They use silkworm cocoon coverings, silkworm pupae, silkworm droppings, mulberry bark, mulberry branches, mulberry fruit, mulberry seeds, and withered mulberry leaves to make various new products that can be eaten, used, and worn.
    They use cocoon coverings to extract precious serine, a special medicine for lung disease; they use the waste water from cocoon boiling to extract sericin, and then extract serine from the sericin.
    Unbreakable Enamel
    The Beijing Enamel Factory has recently successfully trial-produced titanium enamel. This enamel is made of titanium dioxide (commonly known as titanium white) as the basic raw material for firing the enamel glaze (ordinary enamel is fired with quartz powder). It is more durable than ordinary enamel. It does not chip even when thrown on the ground from a height of two or three meters. Therefore, some people call it "unbreakable enamel."

    布底鞋经济、轻便，穿着舒适，我国人民都很爱穿。可是手工纳鞋底，最费时间，又很吃力。
    上海第一缝纫机制造厂生产出一种专纳鞋底的“鞋底缝纫机”，这种机器每分钟可转四百转，不到三分钟即可纳成一双鞋底。它的结构坚固，机上装有小电动马达，既可用脚蹬，又可用电力发动，有电源或无电源地区均可使用。这种机器的价格与一般缝纫机差不多。

    不碎的搪瓷
    北京市搪瓷厂最近也试制成功了钛白搪瓷。这种搪瓷是用氧化钛（通称钛白粉）为基本原料烧制成的瓷釉（普通搪瓷是用石英粉烧制的），比普通搪瓷坚固耐用，从二、三公尺的高空中抛到地上，也不掉瓷。因此有人称它做“不碎搪瓷”。
