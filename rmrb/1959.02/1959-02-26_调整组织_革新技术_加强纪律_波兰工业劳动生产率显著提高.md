Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 24th: Labor productivity in Polish industrial and mining enterprises is continuously increasing. The increase in labor productivity has been particularly significant in the past year.

In the coal mining industry, the amount of coal mined per working day in 1958 was 1,318 kilograms based on the total number of manual laborers, and 1,699 kilograms based solely on the number of miners working underground. In 1957, these figures were 1,239 kilograms and 1,607 kilograms, respectively. In the metallurgical industry, labor productivity in iron and steel smelting has also greatly improved. In 1957, the average output per worker per quarter was 226 tons of iron and 124 tons of steel, while in 1958, these figures increased to 234 tons and 137 tons, respectively. Labor productivity has also shown significant growth in the textile, electricity, and other industrial sectors. Nationwide, in 1958, the number of employees in state-owned industrial sectors increased by only 1.1%, while the total value of products increased by 8.2% compared to the previous year.

The increase in labor productivity in Polish enterprises is a direct result of a series of initiatives undertaken by the Polish United Workers' Party. After the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party put forward the task of increasing labor productivity to the entire party in February 1958, tremendous efforts were made across the country to achieve this goal. In the past year, over 200,000 people were streamlined from factories and enterprises nationwide, and some of these people were transferred to places where manpower was needed. Worker turnover has decreased, labor discipline has been strengthened, and the absenteeism rate has fallen by 15.3% compared to 1957.

In order to improve labor productivity, more systematic work has been carried out in various places to improve labor organization. For example, the Wrocław Vehicle Factory readjusted its production organization and carried out a series of production reforms. As a result, labor productivity increased by 10% last year and is expected to increase by 25% this year. In many factories in Warsaw, labor productivity has increased by 15%-90% due to technological innovation and adjustments in labor organization, without increasing the number of workers.

Currently, more than 80% of the workers in Poland are involved in the production campaign aimed at increasing labor productivity to welcome the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, and many factories have achieved remarkable successes.

    调整组织　革新技术　加强纪律
    波兰工业劳动生产率显著提高
    新华社华沙24日电　波兰工矿企业中的劳动生产率不断提高。最近一年来，劳动生产率的提高尤其显著。
    在煤矿工业中，1958年每个劳动日的采煤量，按所有参加体力劳动的人数计算是一千三百一十八公斤，如仅按在矿井下工作的矿工计算是一千六百九十九公斤，而在1957年，这两个指标分别是一千二百三十九公斤和一千六百零七公斤。在冶金工业中的炼铁、炼钢方面，劳动生产率也都有很大的提高，1957年平均每季每个工人炼铁二百二十六吨，炼钢一百二十四吨，而在1958年则分别提高到二百三十四吨和一百三十七吨。在纺织、电力和其它工业部门中，劳动生产率也有显著的增长。从全国范围来说，1958年公营工业部门中就业人数只增加了1.1％，而产品总值却比上一年增加了8.2％。
    波兰企业中劳动生产率的提高是波兰统一工人党进行了一系列工作的直接结果。1958年2月，波兰统一工人党十一中全会向全党提出了提高劳动生产率的任务后，全国各地为了实现这一任务进行了巨大的工作。在去年一年内，全国的工厂企业中精减了二十余万人，其中一部分人被调到了需要人手的地方。工人流动现象减少了，劳动纪律加强了，缺勤率比1957年下降了15.3％。
    为了提高劳动生产率，各地在改善劳动组织方面进行了较系统的工作。例如弗罗兹瓦夫车辆厂重新调整了生产组织、进行了一系列生产改革后，去年劳动生产率提高了10％，今年将要提高25％。华沙许多工厂在不增加工人人数的情况下，由于技术革新和调整了劳动组织，劳动生产率提高了15％—90％。
    现在，波兰全国80％以上的工人都卷入了以提高劳动生产率为目的的迎接波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会的生产运动，许多工厂获得了显著的成就。
