    苏纳约说，“由于我们经常关怀越南人民反对外国统治的英勇斗争，所以很久以前，我们就听到和读到了许多关于这位为自由而斗争的伟大战士的事迹。”他说，“许久以来印度尼西亚人民就期望有一天能够看见这位伟大的人物，因此，当他们听到苏加诺总统邀请胡志明主席访问印度尼西亚的时候，他们就为不仅是欢迎一位友好国家的领袖，而且也是欢迎一个伟大民族的英雄而振奋。”
    苏纳约接着指出，胡志明主席这次访问对于进一步加强印度尼西亚人民和越南人民的关系有着十分重大的意义。他说，过去，我们都遭受过外国的统治，在那之后，我们已经在反对殖民主义的共同斗争中紧密地进行合作。胡志明主席这次访问，将使我们之间的合作能够按照万隆会议的精神更密切起来。
