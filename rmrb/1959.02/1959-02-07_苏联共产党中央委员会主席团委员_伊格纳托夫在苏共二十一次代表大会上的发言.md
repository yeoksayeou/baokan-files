Xinhua News Agency, February 5th. According to "Pravda" reports: Comrade Ignatov, Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU, delivered a speech at the 21st Congress of the CPSU on the morning of February 2nd. The full text is as follows:

    Comrades! Our party and people, and all progressive mankind, are jubilantly welcoming the grand prospects for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union. These prospects are profoundly and brilliantly elucidated in Comrade Khrushchev's report. The Seven-Year Plan marks such a period in the development of our society: the construction of communism has become the direct practical cause of the party and the working people of our country.

      Millions of People Propose Suggestions for Realizing the Great Plan
      This Demonstrates the Great Strength of Socialist Democracy

    It is clear to the Soviet people that the Seven-Year Plan has a major significance for the struggle for the complete victory of communism. This is clearly reflected in the unprecedented enthusiasm of the people in discussing the control figures, and now in the work of our congress. It is truly exciting to talk about millions of people participating in the discussion of the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan, putting forward their suggestions aimed at realizing the great plan as soon as possible. Here is shown the great strength of socialist democracy.

    Workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals, enriched with the experience of communist construction, firmly believe that the tasks set by the Seven-Year Plan can not only be completed but will surely be overfulfilled. This shows the high level of consciousness and political maturity of the people of our country. This also shows that the Party has created the conditions for the Soviet people to become the true creators and conscious builders of the new society, and that the Party has always unswervingly implemented Lenin's instructions on strengthening ties with the masses, on widely attracting the working people to manage the country, and on fully supporting the creative initiative of the people in the great cause of communist construction. Precisely because the Party relies on the people's high creative initiative and brings into play the initiative of the working people, our country has made great strides in the development of economy and culture in recent years.

    Against the background of the outstanding achievements made by the Soviet people, how despicable and hateful appear the handful of bankrupts of the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov, who have been exposed and crushed, and who have embarked on the criminal path of splitting activities. This group used the most despicable and insidious means of factional struggle, revised the Party's Leninist general line on fundamental issues of our domestic and foreign policies, and undermined the implementation of the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Comrade Khrushchev's following sentence is absolutely true: Whoever raises his hand against his own mother—the Party—is bound to be spurned by the people.

    Just as the surging spring tide sweeps away all the garbage on its path, our Party and the entire Soviet people unanimously condemned these splitters, swept them from their path, and threw them aside. The crushing of the anti-Party group further strengthened the Leninist unity of the Party and made the Party's ranks more closely united around the Central Committee. The people of our country will forever follow the Party and forever regard the Party's policies as their own vital cause. Now, when new and great tasks of communist construction are put forward, the people's belief in the Party's wisdom and the correctness of the Party's policies has increased even more. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Party ranks increased by millions of fighters struggling for the victory of Lenin's immortal cause, outstanding figures from the working class, collective farmers, and Soviet intellectuals, which powerfully proves the working people's infinite love for the Communist Party.

  The Prospects for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union Arouse Warm Reactions Abroad
  The Working People of Fraternal Countries are Particularly Interested in the Seven-Year Plan

    The 21st Congress of the Party and the grand prospects for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union that it discussed have aroused the most enthusiastic reactions abroad. In the countries of the socialist camp, the working people have shown particularly great interest in our Seven-Year Plan, are proud of the grandeur of this plan, and sincerely and heartily wish the Soviet people to achieve the set goals. This makes us happy.

    Even those bourgeois reactionary newspapers known for their hostility towards the Soviet Union have had to pay attention to the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for economic development, and have had to devote a great deal of space to carrying information about our Congress.

    In this situation, the attitude of the Yugoslav press is strange. The Yugoslav newspapers have not made room to objectively introduce the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan to the people. Is this not because the Yugoslav revisionists are trying to prevent the working people of their country from knowing about the achievements of the Soviet Union? In the past, they had obtained rewards for slandering socialist countries. Are they hoping to receive another reward from the imperialists for doing so again?

    Comrades! Khrushchev's report summarized the outstanding achievements of our country in the development of economy, science, and culture, profoundly analyzed the current international situation, and determined the prospects for communist construction. In this report, some extremely important Marxist-Leninist theoretical issues have been further developed. The principles put forward in the report on the two stages of communism, on the path of development and approximation of the collective farm form and the national form of socialist ownership, on the principles of the structure and management forms of the state during the period of communist construction, and other issues, have special significance for the cause of communist construction. There is no doubt that the theoretical principles put forward in the report will serve as an integral part of our Party's new program, which is currently being formulated based on the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU.

    The Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, based on Lenin's doctrine of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, stipulates the further vigorous development of heavy industry as the foundation of the entire Soviet economy. As a result of the implementation of these pre-determined plans, our country will become stronger and make the enemy even more afraid to invade. The development of socialist industry can guarantee the full mechanization of agricultural labor and a rapid increase in the production of agricultural products and consumer goods, which is of paramount importance for raising the living standards of the people.

    The Main Direction of Agriculture Remains to Focus on Vigorously Increasing Grain Production
    The Seven-Year Plan's Planned Grain Output Increase Can Be Overfulfilled

    Comrades! One of the fundamental tasks of the Seven-Year Plan is to ensure that the growth of agricultural production can fully meet the needs of the population for grain and the needs of industry for raw materials. In this regard, the special significance of the December Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee should be emphasized. This meeting was essentially a political report to the people by the Party on the agricultural situation, and was an excellent prelude to this Congress. Many leaders of collective farms and state farms, experienced machine operators, and scientists participated in the December Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, so it was possible to see the prospects of our agriculture more deeply and to unearth more potential in order to develop agricultural production more rapidly.

    As everyone knows, the total agricultural output is to increase by 70% in seven years, the labor productivity of collective farms is to increase by about one time, and the labor productivity of state farms is to increase by about 60% to 65%. In the coming years, the main direction of agriculture will remain to focus on vigorously increasing the production of grain, which is the foundation of the entire agricultural production.

    In the process of discussing the resolutions of the December Plenary Session of the Central Committee, agricultural workers have generally unearthed new potentials, and as long as they know how to use these potentials, they can smoothly complete the tasks put forward by the Party in grain production.

    The collective farms and state farms of the Russian Federation have already started work to strive to harvest 7 billion to 8 billion poods of grain by the end of the seventh year. The agricultural workers of the Ukrainian Republic have put forward the goal of making the total grain output reach 2.1 billion poods. The working people of Kazakhstan are launching a competition to produce 1.5 billion poods of grain annually. The Soviet people are overjoyed by these guarantees. These guarantees prove that the task stipulated by the Seven-Year Plan to increase grain production to no less than 10 billion to 11 billion poods is realistic. Moreover, if the republics, border regions, and states can fulfill their promises (and we have no reason to doubt this), these tasks are likely to be overfulfilled.

    Vigorously increasing grain production is a reliable foundation for completing the tasks of meat and milk production ahead of schedule. The Party believes that striving to produce abundant animal products is one of the major issues of its policy. The Central Committee has emphasized more than once that caring for the increase in the production of meat, milk, and other products is caring for the most pressing needs of the people, and is caring for the improvement of their well-being. This must be pointed out, because not long ago, Malenkov, Molotov, and other participants in the anti-Party group, whenever they were involved in the production of meat and milk, always accused our cadres of being pragmatists and business-minded people, saying that they were trying to replace politics with economics. The Central Committee resolutely countered this anti-Party line and demonstrated with its multifaceted activities that the needs of the people are major politics. The Central Committee's activities in recent years are a model of the combination of in-depth theoretical work and the realization of the most pressing practical tasks for the benefit of the people.

    Livestock Product Output Per Capita Should Catch Up with the United States
    Soviet Agricultural Workers are Enthusiastically Launching a Competition for This Purpose

    Starting from the interests of the people, the Party stipulated that the output of the most important animal products should be sharply increased in seven years. The control figures stipulate that meat output should be no less than 16 million tons (calculated by slaughter weight). Comrades, this is not an easy task. It requires great efforts from collective farms, state farms, agricultural and scientific workers, and the entire people, and it requires party organizations to carry out enormous organizational work. However, our agriculture and our collective farm system have enormous potential, and as long as we start to use this potential, we will not only be able to complete, but also over fulfill the tasks put forward by the Seven-Year Plan. This is extremely important. In order to catch up with the United States in terms of per capita meat production, we need 20 million to 21 million tons of meat per year.

    After the December Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, in the days leading up to the 21st Congress, agricultural workers, with patriotic enthusiasm, strove to more quickly realize the call of the advanced workers in Soviet agriculture—to catch up with the United States in terms of per capita livestock product output, and launched a socialist competition for this purpose, striving to greatly increase the output of meat, milk, and other livestock products.

    As everyone knows, the collective farms and state farms of the Ryazan region are the initiators of the competition. As you know, they decided to complete the tasks stipulated by the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and also decided to sell 150,000 tons of meat to the state this year, while last year they only sold 48,000 tons of meat to the state. This glorious initiative has been enthusiastically supported by collective farms and state farms throughout the country. The agricultural workers of the Krasnodar region guarantee that they will produce 84 quintals of meat per hundred hectares of land this year, that they will double the meat production of collective farms and state farms in one year, and that they will greatly complete the tasks of the seven years ahead of schedule. The entire Russian Federation stipulates that meat production should be increased by 50% this year, and that 4.2 million tons of meat should be sold to the state, which is 1 million tons more than planned.

    The Ukrainian socialist competition has been widely launched. The working people of the republic are striving to complete the tasks of the seven years ahead of schedule in five years, and striving to make the meat production per hundred hectares of land reach 101 quintals in 1963, while the plan stipulates that the meat production per hundred hectares of land in 1965 will be 91.5 quintals.

    Kazakhstan stipulates that it will sell 800,000 tons of meat to the state this year (while 380,000 tons were sold to the state last year), and that it will complete the Seven-Year Plan by 1963 and increase meat production by two times.

    Comrades! Think about these brilliant figures, they make people happy and fill people with confidence in our victory.

    Please allow me to express my confidence: the 21st Congress of the Party will endorse this patriotic initiative and will expect the working people of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and other republics, border regions, and states to successfully fulfill the obligations they have undertaken. (Applause)

    Comrade N.S. Khrushchev spoke at the December Plenary Session of the Central Committee about how much meat, calculated by slaughter weight, each republic should produce per hundred hectares of land in order for the country to catch up with the United States in terms of per capita meat production. These figures are determined based on calculations made in each republic and based on the socialist obligations of each collective farm and state farm. Now let me read out these figures.

                                           Total Production to be Produced in One Year

    The above materials do not explain the structure of the meat balance, which is perfectly understandable. Because each republic has its own conditions and characteristics, according to their conditions and characteristics, some regions will produce more beef, and other regions will produce more pork or mutton. However, most regions, especially in the first few years, will develop pig breeding and poultry farming more quickly. By doing so, it will be possible to accumulate cattle and sheep heads in order to produce and sell more beef and mutton to the state in the future.

  Increasing Meat Output Depends on Increasing the Public Livestock of Collective Farms
  Efforts Should Be Made to Support Advanced Methods of Establishing Large-Scale Poultry Farms

    I want to talk about the main issues in increasing meat production. Comrade N.S. Khrushchev has talked about these issues more than once in his speeches. However, now, when we are discussing the Seven-Year Plan for the development of our country's economy, we should mention this again.

    First of all, we must pay attention to the development of pig breeding, which is the most effective sector. According to the calculations of the staff of the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture, it is stipulated that the production of pork should be increased from 3.4 million tons in 1958 to 9 million tons in seven years. To this end, more than 100 million pigs need to be raised and slaughtered every year by the end of the Seven-Year Plan. This is an arduous task. In order to have so many pigs, it is necessary to ensure that as many piglets as possible are obtained by relying on the main sows and by the method of farrowing once; good breeds should be crossed more widely according to the industrial production method; and the fattening period should be shortened by improving the organization of work. Special attention should also be paid to the fattening of meat pigs and bacon pigs.

    Expanding the output of beef and mutton is an extremely important source for supplementing meat reserves. In recent years, the plan is to make the national output of beef and mutton reach 8.5 million tons, of which beef will reach 6.6 million tons, which is 1.5 times more than in the past year. Tens of millions of livestock will be slaughtered for consumption every year. Therefore, the organization of large-scale shed fattening and grazing fattening, as well as increasing the live weight of edible livestock, is of great national economic significance.

    Comrades, it must be said that the livestock purchased by the purchasing stations in some states now have very small weights. Last year, collective farms and state farms across the country sold a total of more than 11 million heads of livestock, with an average weight of 215 kilograms. If collective farms and state farms rely on good grazing fattening and shed fattening to increase the live weight of livestock, and the weight is even one quintal more when selling livestock (which is completely possible), then the weight of meat obtained after slaughtering the same number of livestock will increase by more than 1 million tons. In recent years, the number of livestock sold by collective farms and state farms will be about twice as many as now. Therefore, it is obvious that the grazing fattening and shed fattening of livestock is one of the important sources of increasing meat output and improving meat quality.

    The purchase of calves by collective farms and state farms for raising and then selling them to the state is of great significance for supplementing meat reserves. The cattle raised by individual collective farmers, workers, and staff members can produce about 17 million calves every year. However, collective farms only purchased 3.5 million heads last year, and most of the calves were slaughtered before they grew up, which is not in the interests of the country.

    Of course, the main thing is to increase the number of public livestock on collective farms. The key to further increasing meat production lies here.

    In addition, raising poultry is also an important source for ensuring the increase in meat production in a short period of time. The output of poultry meat is to reach 2.7 million tons in recent years, which is almost four times more than we currently have. This accounts for about 13% of the total meat output. To obtain so much meat, at least 2.5 billion chickens, ducks, geese, and turkeys must be raised.

    At present, poultry farming in many of our collective farms and state farms is very scattered, and they are all very small farming sites, often as small as sesame seeds. These farming sites require a lot of labor, have high costs, and have very few commodity products. Efforts should be made to support the initiatives of collective farmers and state farms in the Stavropol region, Krasnodar region, Rostov region, Stalino region, and other states, where large-scale poultry farms have been established using advanced methods of raising poultry.

    The interests of the cause require that great efforts be made to establish poultry farms and large farms in cities, industrial centers, and resort areas. In the process of discussing Comrade Khrushchev's report outline, many useful suggestions were put forward on this issue. At the same time, the article published in "Izvestia" by Comrade Tretyakov, director of the All-Union Poultry Science Research Institute, which opposed the establishment of poultry farms in collective farms, made agricultural workers confused. In this regard, I would like to quote a letter from Comrade Koziri, chairman of the Shaumyan Collective Farm in Georgievsk District, Stavropol Region. He wrote:

    "I would like to use our collective farm as an example to prove how serious Professor Tretyakov's fallacy is, and how poor his understanding of the actual situation of collective farms is. I am not exaggerating when I say that it is only because of the establishment of poultry farms that we have rapidly increased the output of eggs. Before the establishment of poultry farms, the total output of eggs was 233,000, while last year we received 1.72 million eggs. The output of eggs has increased nearly seven times in three years. Poultry farms give collective farms a lot of income. Before the establishment of poultry farms, we received 370,000 rubles from poultry farming, while last year we received 1.45 million rubles. This is not just the case of our poultry farm. Eleven poultry farms have been established in our district, and each poultry farm has a high income. Our collective farmers believe that the Poultry Science Research Institute led by Comrade Tretyakov should move from the suburbs of Moscow to an area in the country where chickens lay eggs. (Laughter, applause) We are not opposed to the Poultry Research Institute moving to the Stavropol region, we even demand it. We have a vast area here, and there are many chickens." I think there is every reason to agree with Comrade Koziri's opinion.

    Rabbit breeding should be truly engaged in. Rabbit meat is delicious and nutritious, and can also produce good fur. In this regard, the Communist Youth League, the Young Pioneers organization, and schools can give collective farms and state farms a lot of help.

    The Soviet Union Has Already Surpassed the United States in Total Milk Production
    It Will Soon Surpass in Terms of Per Capita Production

    While paying special attention to increasing meat production, collective farms and state farms should ensure the completion of the major task of milk production. As everyone knows, the milk output of the Soviet Union in 1958 was 57.8 million tons. This is 700,000 tons more than the output of the United States.

    It should be said that two years ago, when Comrade Khrushchev spoke at the meeting of agricultural workers in Leningrad and supported the call of advanced collective farms to catch up with the United States in terms of per capita milk and meat output, the American press rumored that this was impossible and that it was just propaganda. But everyone knows that this propaganda has now become milk and meat. We have already surpassed the United States in total milk production, and we can soon surpass in terms of per capita production. (Applause)

    However, American journalists have not turned around to talk about the real situation in this regard. They are now beginning to write that Russian milk is different from American milk, and that the Russian method of calculating output is different from that of the United States. "The New York Times" wrote on January 16, 1959, that Western observers are skeptical of the Soviet milk production figures because the figures include milk used to feed livestock, even though the gentlemen of "The New York Times" clearly know that the Soviet method of calculating milk is the same as that of other countries, and the same as that of the United States. This is just as the proverb says: "Look at people with a bad heart, and see everyone as bad people"!

    In the fully launched competition, many republics, states, collective farms, and state farms guarantee to complete the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan for the production of milk ahead of schedule. At the same time, it is particularly important to emphasize this point: while improving the productivity of dairy cows, it is stipulated that the number of dairy cows should be greatly increased. This is correct. Now, when faced with the task of sharply increasing the output of livestock products per hundred hectares of land, the task of increasing the number of livestock has decisive significance.

    We have every possibility to complete the task of producing 100 million to 105 million tons of milk stipulated by the control figures before the deadline. This figure is almost twice as much as the current output of the United States.

      To Complete the Huge Task of Increasing Livestock Production
      We Should Continue to Persistently Strengthen the Feed Base

    Comrades! Only if collective farms and state farms continue to persistently strengthen the feed base in the future, and first of all expand the production of corn, can we complete the huge task of increasing the production of meat, milk, and other livestock products.

    Now, the essence of our policy in animal husbandry lies in this. Collective farms and state farms are formulating grand plans. Only if each collective farm and state farm carries out unremitting organizational work in planting high-yield corn can these plans be realized. The December Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee put forward such a task: strive to harvest 500 to 600 quintals of corn green fodder (stems and ears) per hectare, and about 300 quintals in areas with insufficient water, which makes it possible for all collective farms and state farms to store very rich fodder.

    The possibility of a bumper corn harvest is truly unlimited in our country. I would also like to emphasize again the need to most widely promote the experience of the advanced machine operators, delegates to the 21st Congress of the Party, Comrades Manukovsky and Gitalov, in the complete mechanization of corn planting. These comrades and their assistants obtained a bumper corn harvest on an area of 100 to 200 hectares without manual labor. Their experience truly has revolutionary significance for our agriculture, and widely promoting this experience in production is one of the most urgent tasks. Without doing so, it is impossible to reduce the cost of meat and milk, and it is impossible to greatly reduce the cost of unit products.

    This year, many collective farms and state farms plan to expand the corn planting area. For this reason, it should be reminded that preparations must be made in this regard, first of all the work of training cadres. This will ensure that this extremely valuable crop will have a bumper harvest.

    In addition to corn, it is also necessary to increase the production of potatoes, beets, arrowroot peas, clover, lupine, soybeans, and other crops.

    Scientific Research Institutions Should Help Improve Livestock Production
    Cultivating Excellent Cadres is an Important Condition for Improving Agricultural Production

    In order to realize the huge tasks in animal husbandry, scientific research institutions should vigorously help collective farms and state farms. Many of our scientists are successfully solving important theoretical problems, and their work has a good impact on improving animal husbandry. They are greatly respected by agricultural workers.

    However, we also have some scientific workers who are detached from life and engaged in useless work. Here is an example: Comrade Druzhin, a scientific worker at the Rostov-on-Don Agricultural Science Research Institute, completed a "work" entitled "Whether it is Appropriate to Cut Off the Tails of Castrated Fine Wool Sheep". After a long period of research, Comrade Druzhin came to the conclusion: "Among domestic animals, long-tailed sheep, like pigs, have a large number of tail vertebrae." At the same time, it is emphasized that "the tail of a sheep is not as flexible as the tail of a horse or a cow. (Laughter) Therefore, its tail swing can never reach both sides of itself."

    There is no need to argue with the author about whether sheep need tails. However, the question arises: can our science be seen to help sheep farming here?

    Comrades! Now collective farms and state farms are preparing their development plans for the next seven years. This is an extremely important task. This requires a comprehensive consideration of the potential and characteristics of each unit. It is necessary to help collective farms and state farms make careful calculations, help them make correct decisions, which livestock can increase meat production, how much beef, pork, mutton, poultry meat, and rabbit meat can be obtained in how long; how many livestock and poultry should be grazed and shed-fed, how much feed should be stored, and who in the collective farm, state farm, and pasture should be specifically responsible for implementing these or those measures.

    As in the past, our cadres, especially the chairmen of collective farms, will play a decisive role in realizing the task of further developing collective farm production stipulated by the Party. We have cultivated a group of excellent organizers, such as Generalov, Dubkovitsky, Posmitny, Korotkov, Tursunkulov, Burkatskaya, Prozorov, Orlovsky, Andreeva, Ulunhozhayev, Aldabergenov, and many others, and the people have the right to call them marshals of collective farm production. The combination of experienced cadres and young cadres promoted from experts and insiders is an important condition for further improving the leadership of collective farms and state farms.

    The Life of the Soviet People Will Become Better and Happier Year by Year
    They are Advancing Along the Road of Victory Under the Leadership of the Party

    Reaching the planned level of agricultural development will greatly increase the output of the most important foods. In recent years, the output of meat, milk, and animal fats per capita in the United States has been declining, while our socialist agriculture is developing at a rapid pace, ensuring that the output of the most important agricultural products is increasing linearly.

    After completing the tasks of the Seven-Year Plan and realizing the patriotic call of the advanced collective farms to catch up with the United States in terms of livestock product output, the per capita meat output of our country will be equal to or even exceed the current output of the United States. The comparison of per capita output of other products will be as follows (unit: kilograms):

                           Soviet Union      United States
               Milk              466              330
           Animal Fats           5.1              4.0
                   Sugar          44.3             13.7

    It must also be pointed out that the Seven-Year Plan stipulates that huge measures should be taken to increase the output of vegetables, fruits, and grapes.

    Comrades! The time is not far away when every Soviet person's table will have sufficient meat, milk, animal fats, sugar, vegetables, fruits, grapes, and other products. The Soviet people are convinced that our country will surpass the United States in the economic competition of per capita agricultural product output. (Applause)

    The Seven-Year Plan not only brings rich cultural and spiritual wealth to our people, it will also bring abundant material wealth and a high standard of living to our people. You can see from the plan that the real income of workers, staff members, and collective farmers will increase by 40% in seven years. At the same time, the length of the working day will be shortened and the number of working days per week will be reduced. The speed of housing construction will be even faster, and public dining halls and daily life services will be greatly improved. The task of completely stopping the collection of taxes from residents in the near future is put forward.

    The measures of the Communist Party show that the Party truly cares about the lives of the Soviet people, and wants to make their lives better and happier year by year. Only the Communist Party can care about people in this way, and the Party's banner is to strive for the happiness of the people. Every worker in our country cherishes this, and in the fighting ranks of striving to realize the Seven-Year Plan, they stand at their posts and increase the wealth of our motherland with their labor.

    In capitalist countries, the situation of the working people has not and cannot receive such care. Their living standards are constantly declining, and the tax burden is increasing year by year. For example, in the United States, the federal income tax levied on the people alone accounts for more than 51% of the total budget revenue for the current budget year, and the proportion of income tax in the 1959-1960 budget year will increase to 53%. This is a huge figure.

    In our country, all the taxes paid by Soviet citizens account for only 7.8% of the national budget revenue. Comrade N.S. Khrushchev pointed out in his report that taxes will be completely exempted from residents in the near future. The development of the entire socialist economy has prepared the conditions for the realization of this measure of great national economic and political significance, and the implementation of this measure proves the further strengthening of our country's economy and finance.

    Comrades! The program of comprehensively launching communist construction, the new great upsurge and prosperity of the socialist economy and culture, which is expounded in Comrade N.S. Khrushchev's report and discussed by the Congress, is in line with the vital interests of the Soviet people. The realization of this program will mean that the Soviet society will take a huge step on the road to developing towards communism.

    The magnificent Seven-Year Plan has aroused the Soviet people's pride in their motherland. Under the invincible Leninist banner, under the leadership of their beloved and battle-hardened Communist Party, the Soviet people are confidently advancing along the road to the complete victory of communism. (Stormy and lasting applause) (The headings within the text were added by the editor of this newspaper)

    苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员
    伊格纳托夫在苏共二十一次代表大会上的发言
    新华社5日讯　据“真理报”报道：苏共中央主席团委员伊格纳托夫同志2月2日上午在苏共第二十一次代表大会上的发言，全文如下：
    同志们！我们党和人民、全体进步人类欢欣鼓舞地欢迎苏联发展国民经济的宏伟前景。这个前景在赫鲁晓夫同志的报告中得到了深刻而光辉的阐述。七年计划标志着我们社会发展中的这样一个时期：共产主义建设成为党和我国劳动人民的直接的实践的事业。
      千百万人提出实现伟大计划的建议
      这表明了社会主义民主的伟大力量
    苏联人民很清楚地理解七年计划在争取共产主义完全胜利的斗争中的重大意义，这种理解明显地表现在人民在讨论控制数字时的空前的积极性中，而现在，这种理解则明显地表现在我们代表大会的工作中。有千百万人参加七年计划控制数字的讨论，提出他们的旨在尽快实现伟大计划的建议，谈到这种情况就不能不令人兴奋激动。这里表现出了社会主义民主的伟大力量。
    增添了共产主义建设经验的工人、集体农民和知识分子坚决相信，七年计划所拟定的任务不仅可以完成，而且一定会超额完成。这说明我国人民的高度觉悟和政治上的成熟。这也说明，党创造了使苏联人民成为新社会真正的创造者和自觉的建设者的条件，党始终不渝地贯彻列宁的关于加强同群众的联系、关于广泛吸引劳动人民管理国家、关于全力支持人民在共产主义建设的伟大事业中的创造性主动性的指示。正因为党依靠了人民的高度创造积极性和发挥了劳动人民的主动性，近年来我国才在发展经济和文化方面前进了一大步。
    在苏联人民所取得的出色成就的衬托下，已经被揭露和粉碎的马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团这一小撮破产者，显得多么卑鄙可厌，他们走上了分裂活动的罪恶道路。这个集团利用最卑鄙和阴险的派别斗争的手段，修正党在我国内外政策的根本问题上的列宁主义总路线，破坏苏联共产党第二十次代表大会决议的实现。赫鲁晓夫同志的下面这句话真是千真万确：谁要是向自己的母亲——党举起手来，他定要遭到人民的唾弃。
    像汹涌澎湃的春潮扫清自己道路上的所有垃圾一样，我们党和全体苏联人民一致谴责这些分裂分子，把他们从自己的道路上扫清并且抛到一边。反党集团的被粉碎进一步加强了党的列宁主义的团结，使党的队伍更加紧密地团结在中央委员会的周围。我国人民永远跟着党走，永远认为党的政策是自己切身的休戚相关的事业。现在，当提出共产主义建设的新的伟大任务时，人民对党的英明和党的政策的正确性的信仰就更加增长了。在苏共第二十次代表大会以后，党的队伍增加了上百万的为列宁不朽事业的胜利而斗争的战士，工人阶级，集体农民和苏维埃知识分子中间的优秀人物，这有力地证明了劳动人民对共产党的无限热爱。
  苏联发展国民经济前景在国外引起热烈反应
  兄弟国家劳动人民对七年计划兴趣特别巨大
    党的第二十一次代表大会和它所讨论的苏联发展国民经济的宏伟前景，在苏联国外引起了最热烈的反应。在社会主义阵营的国家里，劳动人民对我们的七年计划表现了特别大的兴趣，为这个计划的雄伟气魄而感到骄傲，真诚地、衷心地预祝苏联人民达到预定的目标。这使我们感到高兴。
    就连那些以敌视苏联闻名的资产阶级反动报刊也不得不重视苏联发展经济的七年计划，不得不拿出很大的篇幅来刊载我们代表大会的情况。
    在这种情况下，南斯拉夫报刊的态度是令人奇怪的。南斯拉夫报纸上没有腾出位置来向人民客观地介绍苏联的七年计划。这难道不是因为南斯拉夫修正主义者企图不让本国的劳动人民知道苏联的成就吗？过去他们曾经由于诽谤社会主义国家而取得了赏钱，他们这样做是不是指望再从帝国主义者那里领到一笔赏钱呢？
    同志们！赫鲁晓夫的报告中对我国发展经济、科学和文化的优异成就作出了总结，深刻地分析了当前的国际局势，确定了共产主义建设的前景。在这个报告中，一些极重要的马克思列宁主义理论问题得到了进一步发展。报告中提出的关于共产主义两个阶段的原理，关于社会主义所有制的集体农庄形式和全民形式的发展和接近的道路的原理，关于共产主义建设时期国家结构和管理形式的原理以及其他问题，对共产主义建设事业有着特殊的意义。毫无疑问，报告中所提出的理论原理，将作为现在正在根据苏共第二十次代表大会的决议制定的我们党的新纲领的组成部分。
    发展国民经济的七年计划根据列宁的关于优先发展重工业的学说，规定了进一步大力发展重工业，作为整个苏联经济的基础的基础。实现这些预定计划的结果，我国将变得更加强大，更加使敌人不敢侵犯。发展社会主义工业可以保证农业劳动全盘机械化，迅速增加农产品和消费品的产量，这对提高人民生活水平有着头等意义。
    农业的主要方针仍是全力提高谷物生产
    七年计划规定的谷物增产量能超额完成
    同志们！七年计划的根本任务之一，是要保证农产品产量的增长能够充分满足居民对粮食的需要和工业对原料的需要。在这方面，应该强调指出苏共中央12月全会的特殊意义。这次会议实质上是党就农业情况向人民作的政治报告，是这次代表大会的卓越的序曲。许多集体农庄和国营农场的领导人，经验丰富的机器操使者和科学家参加了苏共中央12月全会，所以有了可能更深入地看到我国农业的前景，发掘出更多的潜力，以便更迅速地发展农业生产。
    大家知道，七年中农业的总产量要增加70％，集体农庄的劳动生产率要大约提高一倍，国营农场的劳动生产率要大约提高60％到65％。今后几年内，农业的主要方针仍然是全力提高整个农业生产的基础——谷物的生产。
    在讨论中央12月全会决议的过程中，农业劳动者普遍挖掘了新的潜力，只要善于利用这些潜力，就能顺利完成党在谷物生产方面所提出的任务。
    俄罗斯联邦的集体农庄和国营农场已经展开了工作，争取到七年末收获七十到八十亿普特谷物。乌克兰共和国农业工作者提出的目标是：使谷物总产量达到二十一亿普特。哈萨克劳动人民正为年产十五亿普特谷物展开竞赛。苏联人民为这些保证感到欢欣鼓舞。这些保证证明，七年计划规定谷物产量增加到不少于一百到一百一十亿普特的任务是现实的。而且，如果各共和国、边疆区和州能够实现自己的诺言（我们没有理由怀疑这一点），这些任务是可能超额完成的。
    大力提高谷物生产是提前完成肉类和奶类生产任务的可靠基础。党认为，争取生产丰足的畜产品是它的政策的重大问题之一。中央委员会曾不止一次地强调，关怀肉类、奶类和其他产品的增产，就是关怀人民最迫切的需要，就是关怀他们福利的提高。这一点是必须指出的，因为不久以前马林科夫、莫洛托夫和反党集团的其他参加者每逢涉及肉类、奶类生产的时候，总是指责我们的干部是实际主义者和事务主义者，说他们企图以经济代替政治。中央委员会对这条反党路线进行了坚决的反击，并用自己多方面的活动表明，人民的需要就是重大的政治。中央委员会最近几年来的活动，是深刻的理论工作同实现为人民造福的最迫切的实际任务相结合的典范。
    按人口计算的畜产品产量要赶上美国
    苏联农业劳动者正为此热烈展开竞赛
    党从人民的利益出发，规定在七年内急剧提高最重要畜产品的产量。控制数字规定，肉类产量不少于一千六百万吨（屠宰重量计算）。同志们，这不是一个轻而易举的任务。需要集体农庄、国营农场、农业和科学工作者以及全体人民作出很大的努力，需要党组织进行巨大的组织工作。但是，我们的农业，我们的集体农庄制度拥有巨大的潜力，只要着手利用这些潜力，我们就不但能够完成、而且能够超额完成七年计划提出的任务。这是极端重要的。为了在按人口平均计算的肉类产量方面赶上美国，我们每年需要有二千到二千一百万吨肉类。
    在苏共中央12月全会以后，在迎接第二十一次代表大会的日子里，农业劳动者满怀爱国热忱争取更快地实现苏联农业先进工作者的号召——在按人口平均计算的畜产品产量方面赶上美国，并为此展开了社会主义竞赛，争取大大增加肉类、奶类和其他畜产品产量。
    大家都知道，梁赞州的集体农庄和国营农场是竞赛的发起者。正如你们所知道的那样，它们决定提前完成七年计划所规定的任务，而且决定要在今年就出售给国家十五万吨肉，而在去年，它们出售给国家的肉只是四万八千吨。这个光荣的创举受到全国各集体农庄和国营农场的热烈支持。克拉斯诺达边疆区的农业工作者保证今年要在每一百公顷的土地上生产八十四公担的肉，要在一年内使集体农庄和国营农场的肉类生产提高一倍半以上，并要大大提前完成七年的任务。整个俄罗斯联邦规定今年要使肉类生产提高50％，要出售给国家四百二十万吨肉，即比计划规定的要多一百万吨。
    乌克兰社会主义竞赛已广泛展开。共和国的劳动人民正在争取提前在五年内完成七年的任务，争取在1963年就要使一百公顷土地的肉类生产达到一百零一公担，而计划规定在1965年一百公顷土地肉类的产量为九十一点五公担。
    哈萨克规定今年要出售给国家八十万吨肉（而去年出售给国家的是三十八万吨），到1963年就完成七年计划，使肉类生产提高二倍。
    同志们！请想想这些光辉的数字吧，它们使人感到喜悦，使人充满对我们胜利的信心。
    请让我表示信心：第二十一次党代表大会将赞同这一爱国主义的倡议，并将期望俄罗斯联邦、乌克兰、哈萨克和其他共和国、边疆区和州的劳动人民能胜利地完成他们所承担的义务。（掌声）
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在中央委员会12月全会上谈到，每一个共和国应该在一百公顷的土地上生产多少以屠宰重计算的肉，才使国家有可能在按人口计算的肉类产量上赶上美国。这些数字是根据在各共和国进行的计算和根据各集体农庄和国营农场的社会主义义务而确定的。现在让我来宣读一下这些数字。一年应生产的总量  （以千吨计）一百公顷土地上的  产量（公担）俄罗斯联邦　12100　54乌克兰　4560　105白俄罗斯　880　90乌兹别克　252　12哈萨克　1250　9格鲁吉亚　175　64阿塞拜疆　151　40立陶宛　320　84摩尔达维亚　282　103拉脱维亚　225　80吉尔吉斯　197　24塔吉克　80　22亚美尼亚　72　53土库曼　80　2.6爱沙尼亚　157　81
    上述材料没有说明肉类平衡结构这是完全可以理解的。因为每一个共和国都有自己的条件和特点，根据它们的条件和特点，有一些地区将多生产一些牛肉，另一些地区将多生产一些猪肉或羊肉。但是，大多数地区，特别是在头几年，将要更快地发展养猪业和养禽业。这样做，就能积累牛羊头数，以便今后生产和出售给国家更多的牛肉和羊肉。
  提高肉类产量关键是增加集体农庄公有牲畜
  应该尽力支持建立大规模养禽场的先进方法
    我想谈谈提高肉类生产的主要问题。关于这些问题，尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫不只一次地在自己的讲话中谈到过。但是，现在，当我们在讨论发展我国经济的七年计划时，应该再提一提这点。
    首先必须注意发展养猪业这个收效最快的部门。根据国家计划委员会和农业部工作人员的计算，规定七年内要使猪肉生产从1958年的三百四十万吨增加到九百万吨。为此，到七年计划结束时，每年需要养育和屠宰一亿多口猪。这是一个艰巨的任务。为了有这样多的猪，就必须保证靠主要的母猪和靠一次产仔的方法获得尽可能多的小猪；应该更加广泛地按工业生产方式实行良种的交配；靠改进工作组织来缩短肥育期限。这里还应该特别注意肉用猪和腊肉用猪的肥育。
    扩大牛羊肉的产量是积累肉类储备的极重要的来源。在最近几年内，计划使全国牛羊肉产量达到八百五十万吨，其中牛肉达到六百六十万吨，即比过去一年增加一点五倍。每年将屠宰数以千万头计的牲畜作食用。因此，大批舍饲肥育和放牧肥育的组织工作以及提高食用牲畜的毛重就具有巨大的国民经济意义。
    同志们，不能不说一说，现在有些州的征购站征购的牲畜体重都很小。去年全国集体农庄和国营农场共出售了一千一百多万头牲畜，平均重量是二百一十五公斤。如果集体农庄和国营农场靠很好的放牧肥育和舍饲肥育而增加牲畜的毛重，在出售牲畜时重量那怕是多一公担（这是完全办得到的），那么同样数量的牲畜屠宰后得到的肉的重量就会增加一百多万吨。最近几年内集体农庄和国营农场将出售的牲畜数量大约要比现在多两倍。因此很明显，牲畜的放牧肥育和舍饲肥育是增加肉类产量和提高肉类质量的重要来源之一。
    集体农庄和国营农场购买小牛来饲养，然后再卖给国家，这对补充肉类储备有很大意义。集体农民、工人和职员个人饲养的牛每年约可生下一千七百万头小牛。但是去年集体农庄只购买了三百五十万头，而大部分的小牛都在未长成的时候屠宰了，这是不符合国家利益的。
    当然，主要的是使集体农庄增加公有牲畜的头数。进一步提高肉类产量的关键就在这里。
    此外，饲养家禽也是保证在短期间内提高肉类产量的重要来源之一。禽肉的产量在最近几年内要达到二百七十万吨，这几乎比我们现有的多四倍。这约占全部肉类产量的13％。要获得这样多的肉，至少要饲养二十五亿只鸡、鸭、鹅和火鸡。
    现在我们许多集体农庄和国营农场中的家禽饲养都很分散，都是一个个很小的、往往像芝麻那样大的饲养场。这种饲养场要花很多劳动力，成本很高，而商品产品则很少。应该尽力支持斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区、克拉斯诺达边疆区、罗斯托夫州、斯大林诺州和其他州集体农民和国营农场的倡举，这些地方都建立了大规模的养禽场，使用了先进的饲养家禽的方法。
    事业的利益要求以很大的精力在城市、工业中心和疗养地周围建立养禽场和大农场。在讨论赫鲁晓夫同志报告提纲的过程中，对这个问题提出了许多有益的建议。与此同时，“消息报”刊载的全苏养禽科学研究所所长特列季雅科夫同志的文章却反对在集体农庄中建立养禽场，这一点使农业工作者感到疑惑不解。在这方面，我想引用斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区格奥尔基耶夫斯克区沙乌米扬集体农庄主席科齐里同志的来信。他写道：
    “我想以我们集体农庄为例来证明特列季雅科夫教授的谬误是多么严重，他对集体农庄实际情况的了解是多么贫乏。我毫不夸张地说，只是由于建立养禽场，我们才迅速增加了蛋类的产量。在建立养禽场之前，蛋类的总产量是二十三万三千枚，而去年我们收了一百七十二万枚蛋。三年来蛋类产量增加了将近七倍。养禽场给集体农庄很大收入。在建立养禽场之前，我们从养禽业收入三十七万卢布，而去年我们收入了一百四十五万卢布。这并不单是我们一个养禽场的情况。我们区里建立了十一个养禽场，每个养禽场的收入都很高。我们集体农民认为，特列季雅科夫同志所领导的养禽科学研究所应该从莫斯科近郊搬到国内某一个有鸡生蛋的地区去。（笑声，掌声）我们不反对养禽研究所搬到斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区来，我们甚至要求这样做。我们这里是一个辽阔的地方，鸡很多”。我认为完全有理由可以同意科齐里同志的意见。
    应该真正地来从事养兔业。兔子肉味鲜美，又有营养，还能生产很好的毛皮。在这个问题上共青团、少先队组织和学校可以给集体农庄和国营农场很大的帮助。
    苏联在牛奶总产量方面已经超过美国
    在按人口计算产量方面也很快能超过
    集体农庄和国营农场在特别注意增加肉类产量的同时，应该保证完成牛奶产量的重大任务。大家知道，1958年苏联的牛奶产量是五千七百八十万吨。这比美国的产量多七十万吨。
    应该说，两年前，赫鲁晓夫同志在列宁格勒农业工作者会议上发言，支持先进集体农庄关于在按人口平均计算的牛奶和肉类产量方面赶上美国的号召时，美国的报刊哄传说，这是不能实现的，这只是宣传。但是大家知道，这个宣传现在已经变成了牛奶和肉类。我们在牛奶的总产量方面已经超过了美国，在按人口平均计算产量方面也很快可以超过。（掌声）
    但是，美国的记者再没转过来谈这方面的真实情况。他们现在开始写道，俄国的牛奶和美国的不一样，俄国计算产量的办法和美国不同。“纽约时报”1959年1月16日写道，西方的观察家对苏联牛奶产量的数字抱着怀疑的态度，因为这个数字把用来喂牲口的牛奶也计算在内，尽管“纽约时报”的先生们清楚地知道，苏联计算牛奶的方法是同其他国家一样，同美国也是一样的。这就正如谚语所说：“用坏心肠看人，把大家都看成了坏人”！
    在全面展开的竞赛中，许多共和国、州、集体农庄和国营农场保证提前完成七年计划关于生产奶类的任务。同时着重指出这样一点是特别重要的：在提高奶牛产品生产率的同时，规定大大增加奶牛的头数。这是正确的。现在，在面临急剧提高每一百公顷土地上畜产品产量的时候，增加牲畜头数的任务就具有决定性的意义。
    我们有一切可能使控制数字规定的生产一亿至一亿零五百万吨牛奶的任务在规定期限之前完成。这个数字差不多比美国现在的产量多一倍。
      要完成增加畜产品生产的巨大任务
      就应继续坚持不懈地加强饲料基地
    同志们！只有集体农庄和国营农场今后仍将坚持不懈地加强饲料基地，首先是扩大玉蜀黍的生产，我们才能完成增加肉类、奶类和其他畜产品生产的巨大任务。
    现在，我们在畜牧业方面的政策的实质就在于此。集体农庄和国营农场正在拟定宏伟的计划。只有每个集体农庄和国营农场在种植高产量玉蜀黍方面进行不懈的组织工作，这些计划才能实现。苏共中央12月全会曾提出这样一个任务：努力争取每公顷收获五百至六百公担玉蜀黍青饲料（茎和穗），而在水量不足的地区收获三百公担左右，这就使所有集体农庄和国营农场有可能储存十分富裕的饲料。
    玉蜀黍丰收的可能性在我们这里真是无限的。我还想再一次强调有必要最广泛地推广先进的机器操使者、党的第二十一次代表大会代表马努科夫斯基同志和吉塔洛夫同志在玉蜀黍种植工作全盘机械化方面的经验。这些同志跟自己的助手一起在一百至二百公顷的面积上不用手工劳动获得玉蜀黍丰收。他们的经验对我们的农业确实具有革命的意义，在生产中广泛推广这种经验是最迫切的任务之一。不这样做，就不可能降低肉类和奶类的成本，就不可能大大降低单位产品的成本。
    今年，许多集体农庄和国营农场计划扩大玉蜀黍播种面积。为此，应当提醒必须做好这方面的准备工作，首先是培养干部的工作。这样就将有十足的把握使这种极珍贵的作物获得丰收。
    除了玉蜀黍以外，还要增产马铃薯、甜菜、箭筈豌豆、三叶草、羽扇豆、大豆和其他作物。
    科学研究机关应该帮助提高畜牧业生产
    培养优秀干部是提高农业生产重要条件
    为了实现畜牧业方面的巨大任务，科学研究机关应大力帮助集体农庄和国营农场。我国的许多科学家正在胜利地解决重要的理论问题，他们的工作对提高畜牧业产生良好的影响。他们受到农业劳动者的很大尊敬。
    然而，我们也有这样一些科学工作者，他们脱离生活而从事无益的工作。这里可以举一个实例，罗斯托夫顿河农业科学研究所的科学工作者德鲁金同志完成了一部以“割断去势细毛羊的尾巴是否适宜”为题的“著作”。德鲁金同志经过长期的研究得出一个结论：“在家畜中间，长尾羊同猪一样有着大量的尾椎骨”。同时强调指出，“羊的尾巴没有马或牛的尾巴那样灵活。（笑声）因此它的尾巴甩动起来永远达不到自身的两侧”。
    无需同作者辩论，羊是否需要尾巴。但是，产生了这样一个问题：这里是否能够看到我们的科学对养羊业的帮助？
    同志们！现在集体农庄和国营农场正在编制本单位今后七年的发展计划。这是一项极其重要的工作。这要求全面考虑每个单位的潜力和特点。必须帮助集体农庄和国营农场精打细算，帮助它们作出正确的决定，养哪些家畜能增产肉类，在多长期间能得到多少牛肉、猪肉、羊肉、禽肉和家兔肉；要放牧和舍饲的家畜和家禽有多少，要储备多少饲料，在集体农庄、国营农场、牧场中由谁专门负责来执行这些或那些措施。
    也像过去一样，在实现党所规定的进一步发展集体农庄生产任务方面，我们的干部，首先是集体农庄主席将起决定性作用。我们培养出了一批优秀的组织者，如格涅拉洛夫、杜勃科维茨基、波斯米特内依、科罗特科夫、图尔逊库洛夫、布尔卡茨卡娅、普罗佐罗夫、奥尔洛夫斯基、安德烈耶娃、乌隆霍扎耶夫、阿尔达别尔格诺夫以及许许多多其他的人，人民有权把他们称为集体农庄生产元帅。有经验的干部同由专家和内行中提拔出来的年轻干部相结合，是进一步改善集体农庄和国营农场领导的一个重要条件。
    苏联人民的生活将一年比一年美好幸福
    他们正在党的领导下沿着胜利道路前进
    农业发展达到计划规定的水平，就能够大大增加最重要的食品的产量。近年来，美国按人口平均计算的肉类、奶类和动物油脂的产量在下降而我们的社会主义农业以飞快的速度发展着，保证极最重要的农产品产量以直线上升。
    在完成七年计划任务和实现先进集体农庄提出的在畜产品产量方面赶上美国的爱国主义号召之后，我国按人口平均计算的肉类产量将等于、甚至超过美国目前的产量。其他产品按人口平均计算的产量的对比情况将如下（单位：公斤）：
                          苏联　美国
                奶类　466　330
            动物油脂　5.1　4.0
                    糖　44.3　13.7
    还必须指出，七年计划规定在增加蔬菜、水果、葡萄的产量方面采取巨大的措施。
    同志们！每个苏联人的餐桌上将有充足的肉类、奶类、动物油脂、糖、蔬菜、水果、葡萄和其他产品的时候已经不远了。苏联人民确信，我国在按人口平均计算的农产品产量的经济竞赛中必将超过美国。（掌声）
    七年计划不仅给我国人民带来丰富的文化和精神财富，它还将为我国人民带来丰裕的物质财富和高度的生活水平。你们从计划中可以看出，七年内工人、职员和集体农民的实际收入将增加40％。同时将缩短工作日的时间并减少每周的工作日数。住宅建设的速度还将更快，公共食堂和日常生活服务将大大地改善。提出了在最近几年内就要完全停止向居民收税的任务。
    共产党的措施表明党真正关怀苏联人的生活，要使他们的生活一年比一年美好和幸福。只有共产党才能这样关怀人，党的旗帜就是为人民的幸福而奋斗。我国每个劳动者都珍视这一点，在争取实现七年计划的战斗行列中，他们站在自己的岗位上，以自己的劳动增加我们祖国的财富。
    在资本主义国家，劳动人民的境况就没有、而且也不可能受到这种关怀。他们的生活水平在不断下降，赋税负担在年年加重。比如在美国，仅是对人民征收的联邦所得税一项，就占本预算年度全部预算收入的51％以上，而1959—1960年预算年度中所得税的比例要增加到53％。这是一个庞大的数字。
    在我们国家，苏联公民缴纳的全部税款只占国家预算收入的7.8％。尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中指出，最近几年内就将完全不向居民征税。整个社会主义经济的发展为实现这一具有巨大国民经济意义和政治意义的措施准备了条件，这一措施的实行证明我国经济和财政的进一步加强。
    同志们！尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫的报告中所阐明的、并经代表大会讨论的全面展开共产主义建设的纲领、社会主义经济和文化新的巨大高涨和繁荣的纲领，是符合苏联人民的切身利益的。实现这一纲领将意味着苏维埃社会在向共产主义发展的道路上迈出巨大的一步。
    宏伟的七年计划引起了苏联人对自己祖国的自豪感。苏联人民在战无不胜的列宁主义旗帜下，在自己亲爱的，久经战斗锻炼的共产党的领导下，满怀信心地沿着共产主义完全胜利的道路前进。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）　（文内插题是本报编者加的）
