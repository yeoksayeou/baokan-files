    Shanghai's Loud Songs

    The inaugural issue of "Shanghai Songs," a merger of the former Shanghai "Broadcast Song Selections" and "Creative Song Selections," has been published, joining the ranks of music publications with a fresh new look.

    "Shanghai Songs" lives up to its name, brimming with the loud songs resounding throughout Shanghai, offering a diverse range of content. It features newly composed songs, folk song adaptations, and foreign songs; short essays, music lectures, song discussions, new book reviews, and reports on musical activities. The themes of the songs are wide-ranging, from singing about 1959 and Sino-Soviet friendship to steelmaking, agricultural production, and running canteens; and the forms are also relatively diverse, including mass songs, new folk song choruses ("There is No Jade Emperor in Heaven"), performance songs ("Big News in Agriculture"), female voice ensembles, and male voice ensembles. It is evident that the editors have specially prepared this content to cater to the various needs of the broad readership. The literary section is characterized by its brevity and broad coverage. You see, there is Comrade He Luting's commentary on the creation of mass songs, as well as workers Li Genbao and revolutionary disabled soldier Tang Chongxi sharing their creative experiences and processes.

    Currently, there are already twenty or thirty music publications nationwide. This is one of the signs of the forward development of music work. However, from the perspective of the broad readership, there is also this issue: in terms of the appearance of the publications, many are similar. Therefore, there is not much room for choice. How to make music publications more distinctive is indeed a major issue. In this regard, "Shanghai Songs" already has its own style. However, it can go even further. For example, is there a need for lengthy serialized lectures on songwriting techniques? Similar articles are published in the previous "Mass Music" and the current "Jiangsu Music" and "Yangtze River Songs." In terms of the content of the writing, it can also reflect more issues with ideological inclinations, and song discussions can also be deeper. In this way, it can more profoundly reflect and practically promote the advancement of music work.

    上海歌声嘹亮
    由原来上海“广播歌选”与“创作歌选”合并的“上海歌声”创刊号出版了，它以新的面貌参加了音乐刊物的战斗行列。
    “上海歌声”，名副其实，充满着响彻上海的嘹亮的歌声，内容多种多样。有新创作的歌曲，民歌改编和外国歌曲；有短论，有音乐讲座，歌曲讨论，新书评介以及音乐活动报道。歌曲的题材是广泛的，从歌唱1959年、中苏友谊到炼钢、农业生产、办食堂等等；而题材也比较多样，除了群众歌曲外，有新民歌的合唱（“天上没有玉皇”）、表演唱（“农业大新闻”）、女声小合唱、男声小合唱等等。看得出来编者是特地为广大读者的各种不同的需要准备了这些内容。文学部分的特色，是短小而接触面宽。你看，既有贺绿汀同志关于群众歌曲创作的评论，又有工人李根宝、革命残废军人汤重稀谈创作经验和经过。
    现在，全国各地的音乐刊物已有二、三十种。这是音乐工作向前发展的标志之一。但是，从广大读者的角度说来，也有这样一个问题：在刊物的面貌上，许多刊物是近似的。因此，选择的余地不多。如何使音乐刊物更有自己的特色，的确是一个大问题。在这方面，“上海歌声”已经有了它自己的风格。但是，也可以更进一步。比如，是否需要长篇连载的歌曲作法讲座呢？这种内容在以前的“群众音乐”和现在的“江苏音乐”、“长江歌声”都登载类似的文稿。在文字的内容上，还可以更多的反映一些有思想倾向的问题，歌曲讨论也还可以更深一些。这样，就能够更深刻地反映和实际推动音乐工作前进。
