    Sisters Compete in Culture
    In the past, when visiting one's maternal home,
    One would talk about chickens and ducks;
    Now, when visiting one's maternal home,
    Sisters compare their cultural knowledge.
    Everyone strives not to fall behind,
    Making the old mother extremely happy.

    姐妹比文化
    过去走娘家，
    谈鸡又谈鸭；
    现在走娘家，
    姐妹比文化。
    个个不落后，
    乐坏老妈妈。
      顾惠良　诗
