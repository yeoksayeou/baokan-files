　　A Phoenix Flies on Phoenix Island
　　Liao Junzhang
　　The small island we are stationed on is located deep in the vast South Sea and is called Phoenix Island. A beautiful myth is passed down here...

　　In the distant past, a phoenix bird lived on Lotus Mountain. She flew over the sea every day to save fishermen who were on the verge of death in violent storms. Unfortunately, a talkative crow spread the news to the ears of a wicked Taoist. The wicked Taoist was determined to kill the phoenix bird. One day, as the phoenix was spreading its wings and flying in the sky, the wicked Taoist drove demonic fire and burned off her beautiful feathers. As a result, the phoenix somersaulted and fell into the South Sea, turning into a stone phoenix. Later, people called her "Phoenix Island." "Phoenix cries, five islands come," whenever a sea storm is about to arrive, the stone phoenix would call out "Jip, jip, jip," and the five nearby small islands would lean towards her, connecting together to block the wind and waves, so that the fishermen could calmly take shelter under her two wings. However, the vicious Taoist did not give up. He took a sharp saw and sawed off the phoenix's neck, and the phoenix died. From then on, the tide near the phoenix's neck, and the stones there, all became dark brown. People say this was dyed by the phoenix's blood. Even now, even if the sea is calm, the waves near the phoenix's neck are particularly turbulent, as if forever mourning for the phoenix.

　　The phoenix died! The fishermen were plunged into a time of suffering. People encountered storms at sea and were swept away by the wind and waves, disappearing without a trace. Phoenix Island was also barren, and the fishermen suffered from the exploitation and oppression of Japanese devils, Kuomintang bandits, and fishing despots. Phoenix Island became a nest of disasters.

　　The sea water ebbed and flowed, the sun rose and set, but the fishermen's suffering had no end.

　　There was a fisherman named Ke Hai on Nan'ao Island. He had a wife named Huang Yingying and a son named Ke Hongfei. From the age of twelve, he sailed a broken boat day and night, braving wind and rain, drifting at sea for forty-five years. Japanese devils, the Kuomintang, and fishing despots robbed him of all the fish and shrimp he had worked so hard to catch every day. Every evening, his wife and child had to return home empty-handed from the beach. What bitter years!

　　One day, Ke Hai was fishing at sea when a level 10 typhoon suddenly struck. A wave capsized the boat. In the evening, Huang Yingying and Ke Hongfei never saw their husband and father return to shore! On this Phoenix Island, how could there be just one Ke Hai? Phoenix in people's hearts, when will you finally appear?

　　Pious fishermen always take incense and candles to Phoenix Island to pray whenever they go fishing or on festivals, but suffering, storms, huge waves, and death still haunt people like plagues.

　　A clap of spring thunder, the sun comes out! Since the five-star red flag fluttered on the phoenix's head, Phoenix Island has grown green feathers again, and the people's soldiers guard Phoenix Island day and night. Every day, the fishermen face the rising sun and fish peacefully, and the songs of a bountiful harvest ripple on the sea.

　　The fisherman's son, Ke Hongfei, has grown up. He inherited his father's profession, joined the fishing cooperative, and happily fishes on the sea. Two years ago, on the Mid-Autumn Festival, August 15th, the sky was hazy, and Ke Hongfei said goodbye to his mother and his fiancée and was about to go out to sea. His mother said: Come back early to enjoy the moon. Before she finished speaking, he strode away. His fiancée looked at his strong back affectionately, silently blessing him.

　　There were four fishermen going out to sea this time, and they were fishing in the sea near Phoenix Island. In the afternoon, a level 12 typhoon suddenly struck at sea. The storm howled like a wolf, and the small wooden boat was overturned. All four people fell into the sea, tossed up and down by the waves, and were about to lose their lives. At this time, soldiers Liu Ruxi and Zhan Xiqiang, who were on duty on Phoenix Island, immediately erected a bamboo raft and rushed forward to rescue them at the risk of their lives. The wind was roaring, the spray was splashing, and the waves were as high as buildings. As soon as the bamboo raft went down, it was submerged by the huge waves. The bamboo raft drilled in the waves, the people rolled in the waves, and they bravely jumped into the sea, holding the fishermen tightly with their hands, and finally rescued them from the turbulent waves. The soldiers on the island gave them their own clothes to wear, boiled ginger soup for them to drink, and cooked rice for them to eat, warmly entertaining the guests from the sea. Early the next morning, the soldiers sent them home by boat. As soon as Ke Hongfei stepped over the threshold, he saw that his mother and fiancée had already cried their eyes red. His mother took the soldier's hand and said excitedly:

　　"Phoenix, phoenix, phoenix has appeared again on Phoenix Island! The phoenix is our People's Liberation Army!"

　　From then on, the fishermen and the garrison in this area had an even deeper relationship. Sometimes fishermen were stung by poisonous fish, and military doctors would go to the boat to give them injections and medicine. The fishermen said: "There is magic medicine on Phoenix Island." The soldiers on the island also dug a well for the use of fishermen coming and going, and the fishermen called it the "Friendship Well." The nearby fishermen also regarded the soldiers on the island as relatives. Sometimes the storms on the island lasted for more than half a month, and military pay and supplies could not be transported in time. The fishermen would risk their lives to transport them, saying: "We will never let our soldiers stand guard hungry."

　　During festivals, the fishermen are still willing to come to Phoenix Island, but they no longer bring incense and candles, but hold flowers, eggs, fresh big fish, letters of condolences, and bright red banners...

　　Now, on this vast South Sea, whether it is the people who fish or the people who live by the sea, they all know that there are phoenixes again on Phoenix Island, but there is no longer just one, but many, many brave phoenixes. People sing:

　　Phoenix, phoenix,
　　Flying in the storm,
　　Singing in the waves,
　　Never put away your wings.
　　Phoenix, phoenix,
　　You auspicious bird,
　　Dear People's Liberation Army,
　　You are always in our hearts.

### 凤屿岛上凤凰飞

    凤屿岛上凤凰飞
    廖俊章
    我们驻守的这个小岛在辽阔的南海深处，叫凤屿岛。这里流传着一个美丽的神话……
    在遥远的古代，莲花山上住着一只凤凰鸟，她天天在大海上飞翔，去拯救暴风巨浪中九死一生的渔民。不幸，多嘴的乌鸦把这消息传到一个妖道的耳朵里。妖道决心要害死凤凰鸟。有一天，凤凰正展翅在凌空飞舞，妖道驾着妖火，把她美丽的羽毛烧光了，于是凤凰翻了个跟斗，落在南海中，变成了石凤，后来人们就叫她“凤屿岛”。“凤鸣五屿来”，每当海上风暴即将来临的时候，石凤便“唧，唧，唧”地呼唤，附近的五个小岛便向她靠拢，连接在一起，把风浪挡住，渔民们便可以从容地在她的两个翅膀下避风了。但是，恶毒的妖道并没有死心，它拿着锐利的大锯，把凤脖子锯断了，凤凰死去了。从此，凤脖子边的潮水，和那里的石头都成了棕黑色。人们说，这是凤凰的血染成的；一直到现在，纵使海面是风平浪静的，凤脖子边的风浪也特别汹涌，好像永远为凤凰而哀鸣。
    凤凰死了！渔民陷入苦难的岁月中，人们在海上遇着风暴，一下就被风浪卷走了，连影子都看不见。凤屿岛上也寸草不生，渔民受尽日本鬼子、国民党海匪、渔霸的剥削和压迫，凤屿岛变成了灾难的巢穴。
    海水退了又涨，太阳升起又落，渔民的苦难却没个尽头。
    南澳岛有个渔民叫柯海，他有一个妻子叫黄英英，有一个儿子叫柯红飞。他从十二岁那年开始，就日夜驾着一只破船，风里来雨里去，在海上漂流了四十五年。日本鬼子，国民党，渔霸，每天都把他辛苦捞来的鱼虾抢个精光，每天傍晚，他的妻子和孩子在海滩只好空着手回家，好苦的岁月啊！
    有一天，柯海在海上捕鱼，突然刮起十级台风，一个浪头把船打翻了，傍晚，黄英英和柯红飞再也没有见到自己的丈夫、爸爸回岸了！在这凤屿岛上，又何止一个柯海呢？人们心中的凤凰啊，你到底何时才能出现呢？
    虔诚的渔民，每逢打鱼或是节日的时候，总是拿着香烛到凤屿岛来祷告，但是苦难、暴风、巨浪、死亡仍像瘟神一样地缠着人们。
    春雷一声响，太阳出来了！自从五星红旗飘扬在凤头上，凤屿岛上又长满了青翠的羽毛，人民战士日夜守卫在凤屿岛上。每天，渔民迎着初升的朝阳，安详地在捕鱼，丰收的渔歌在海上荡漾。
    渔民的儿子柯红飞长大了，他继承了父亲的职业，参加了渔业社，欢乐地在海面上捕鱼。前两年八月十五中秋节这一天，天色朦胧，柯红飞辞别母亲和他的未婚妻要出海了。母亲说：早点回来赏月。话还没有说完，他就一个箭步跑去了，未婚妻深情地望着他健壮的背影，为他默默地祝福。
    这次出海的有四个渔民，他们在凤屿岛附近的海面上捕鱼。午后，海上突然刮起了十二级的台风，暴风像狼一样的呼啸，小木船被打翻了，四个人全掉下海，跟着大浪翻上翻下，眼看着要送命了。这时，在凤屿岛上放哨的士兵刘如希和詹锡强同志，马上架起竹筏，冒着生命的危险向前抢救，风在咆哮，浪花在飞溅，浪头像楼房一样的高，竹筏子一下去就给巨浪淹没了。竹筏在浪里钻，人在浪里滚，他俩英勇的跳入海中，双手紧紧抱住渔民，终于在惊涛骇浪中，把他们抢救脱险了。岛上的战士们拿自己的衣服给他们穿，煮姜汤给他们喝，煮饭给他们吃，热情的招待来自海上的客人。第二天一早，战士们用船把他们送回家。柯红飞一踏进门槛，只见母亲和未婚妻已经哭红了眼睛，母亲拉着战士的手激动地说：
  “凤凰，凤凰，凤屿岛上又出现了凤凰了！凤凰就是咱们的解放军呀！”
    从此，这一带的渔民和驻军就有了更深的感情。有时渔民给毒鱼刺伤了，军医便到船上给他们打针服药，渔民说：“凤屿岛上有了神仙药。”岛上的战士们还挖了一口井是供来往渔民吃用的，渔民称它为“友谊井”。附近的渔民把岛上的战士也当成亲人，有时岛上风暴刮上半个多月，军饷物资暂时运不来，渔民们便冒着生命危险给运上来，他们说：“我们绝不让我们的战士饿着肚子站岗放哨。”
    每逢节日，渔民们都还愿意到凤屿岛上来，但，他们拿的不是香烛了，而是捧着鲜花、鸡蛋、鲜大的鱼、慰问信、红艳艳的锦旗……
    如今，在这辽阔的南海上，不管是捕鱼的人，还是海边上住的人都知道，凤屿岛上又有了凤凰，但已经不再是一个了，而是有了许多许多英勇的凤凰了。人们唱着：
    凤凰啊，凤凰，
    在暴风中飞翔，
    在巨浪中歌唱，
    从不收起翅膀。
    凤凰啊，凤凰，
    你这吉祥之鸟，
    亲爱的解放军呀，
    你永远在我们的心上。
