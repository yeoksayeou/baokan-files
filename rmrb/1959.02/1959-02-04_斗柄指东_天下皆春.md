    The Handle of the Dipper Points East, All Under Heaven is Spring
    February 4th, Lichun (Beginning of Spring)! From this point on, the earth will return to spring, and all things will revive! The stars in the azure sky are quietly moving their light steps, changing positions, delicately and brightly welcoming the arrival of spring.
    "When the Handle of the Dipper points east, all under heaven is spring; when the Handle of the Dipper points south, all under heaven is summer; when the Handle of the Dipper points west, all under heaven is autumn; when the Handle of the Dipper points north, all under heaven is winter." The Handle of the Dipper refers to the stars Yuheng, Kaiyang, and Yaoguang of the Big Dipper. These three, arranged like a handle in this constellation, together with the four stars Tianshu, Tianxuan, Tianji, and Tianquan that form the Dipper's bowl, are called the Big Dipper. In February, after dusk, around seven or eight o'clock, the Big Dipper appears in the northeastern sky, with the Handle of the Dipper pointing to the eastern horizon.
    Due to the Earth's rotation, the stars in the sky appear to be rotating around the North Star. Generally speaking, the height of the North Star above the horizon is equal to the local geographical latitude. In Beijing, the North Star is about forty degrees above the horizon. The Big Dipper is exactly within the range of not exceeding forty degrees from the North Star, so no matter which direction it rotates to around the North Star, we can see it, and it will never fall below the horizon.
    The season when the Handle of the Dipper points east, and all under heaven is spring, has arrived. In another three months, the Big Dipper will appear near the zenith, with the Handle of the Dipper pointing south; in August, it will appear in the northwest, with the Handle of the Dipper pointing west; in November, it will appear on the northern horizon directly below the North Star, with the Handle of the Dipper pointing north.

### 斗柄指东  天下皆春

    斗柄指东  天下皆春
    2月4日，立春了！从此将大地春回、万物苏生！那碧空中的星星，静静地移动着轻盈的步子，变换了位置，纤柔灼烁地欢迎春天的到来。
    “斗柄东指，天下皆春；斗柄南指，天下皆夏；斗柄西指，天下皆秋；斗柄北指，天下皆冬。”斗柄就是北斗七星的玉衡、开阳、摇光三星。它们三个，像柄把一样排列在这一组星座中，同天枢、天璇、天玑、天权四星组成的斗勺合称为北斗七星。2月里黄昏以后七、八点钟的时候，北斗七星出现在东北方天空，斗柄指着东面的地平线。
    由于地球的自转，天上的星星看起来都好像绕着北极星在旋转。一般来说，北极星离地平的高度等于当地的地理纬度，在北京来说，北极星高出地平约四十度。北斗七星正好都在离北极星不超出四十度的范围内，因此，不论它转到北极星的哪个方向，我们都可以看到它，它永远也不会落到地平线以下去。
    斗柄指东，天下皆春的季节已经来到了。再过三个月，北斗七星将出现在近天顶的附近，斗柄指南；8月，它将出现在西北方，斗柄指西；11月它将出现在北极星下面的正北地平线上，斗柄指向北方。
