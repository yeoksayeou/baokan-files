Popularize Philosophy, Liberate Thought
Experiences of Lai'an County, Anhui Province in Organizing Cadres and Masses to Study Philosophy
Zhang Chunhan, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee

    Beginning in late August of last year, Lai'an County, Anhui Province, closely integrated with socialist and communist education, launched a campaign throughout the county for cadres and masses to study philosophy. Over the past few months, the broad masses have initially studied philosophical common sense such as the relationship between matter and consciousness, the need to proceed from reality, the subjective initiative of people, the universal connection and development of things, the principal and secondary contradictions, and the two types of contradictions with different natures. Philosophy has indeed significantly improved the thinking of cadres and the masses, becoming their spiritual weapon for self-education.

      The County Party Committee Attaches Importance to Leading the Study
    The Lai'an County Party Committee attaches great importance to the ideological and political education of the masses. They do not view work and ideological education as mutually exclusive, but rather believe that the more intense the work and the more problems there are, the more necessary it is to do a good job in ideological and political work. They regard organizing cadres and the masses to study philosophy as an important part of ideological and political education. Therefore, while welcoming the high tide of people's communes, the County Party Committee made a resolution on launching a philosophy study movement to promote the establishment of people's communes and accelerate the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. After the full-scale launch of the study movement, the County Party Committee strengthened the organization, ideological leadership, and teaching guidance of the movement. In terms of teaching guidance, the County Party Committee frequently studied the problems existing in teaching, and timely proposed the teaching content and debate focus for each stage, so that the philosophy study could be deepened step by step. The first secretaries of the County Party Committee and the Township Party Committees not only personally participated in the leadership of this movement, but also took the lead in studying, teaching, and publicizing.
  Closely Integrate with Reality to Promote Work and Production
    The purpose of the working people studying philosophy is to serve politics and production. Therefore, throughout the entire teaching process, it is necessary to closely integrate with the central task and current production, so that philosophy study can have an immediate effect, promote work, and promote production. The experience of Lai'an County is precisely this. When they launched the mass philosophy study, it was the high tide of people's communes. The county's philosophy lecturing group, which was also the commune establishment work group, helped establish communes on the one hand and lectured on philosophy to the masses on the other hand, using philosophical principles to promote the superiority of the people's communes. When the masses understood that things are constantly developing and that the people's communes have more advantages than advanced cooperatives, they reported enthusiastically and proactively requested to establish communes. They said, "Things are developing, the revolution is continuous, the people's commune is like climbing stairs step by step, we cannot stop halfway." When vigorously supporting the "Marshal Steel" to get started, the philosophy lecturing group used the principle of grasping the main contradiction to promote the great significance of taking steel as the key link, which greatly promoted the movement of making steel in a big way. For example, in the past, Yuming Township's work was very backward, and the political thinking of some grassroots cadres was impure, confusing the two types of contradictions with different natures. As a result, the reactionary arrogance of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements was rampant, and the masses' enthusiasm for production was low. When the philosophy lecturing group lectured on philosophy there, they focused on the two types of contradictions with different natures, rectified the commune while teaching, mobilized the masses to launch struggles against illegal landlords and rich peasants, while correctly handling contradictions among the people and vigorously leading production. This upheld righteousness and overwhelmed evil, making the township's work completely new, changing from backward to advanced, and becoming the county's advanced unit in the "three autumns" work. Through the study of philosophy, the ideological consciousness of the broad grassroots cadres has been greatly improved, and their work style has been significantly improved, which is prominently manifested in the fact that their work methods are more refined and their simple and crude work style has been reduced. In the past, many grassroots cadres felt that the tasks were heavy, the lines of work were numerous, and there were few solutions, and they often tried to do everything at once, causing losses to the work. Huang Chao-yu, the secretary of the Du Dai Brigade branch in Shiguan Township, should have harvested wheat when it matured last summer, but he assigned the main labor force to shovel grass, resulting in a hailstorm that destroyed more than 1,000 mu of wheat. When someone criticized him at the time, he did not understand and said, "The hailstorm from heaven has nothing to do with me." After studying "principal and secondary contradictions" this time, he understood the principle of "digging up the roots of the tree, grasping the center of the work," and took the initiative to examine his mistakes.

    Another significant gain from the Lai'an County masses' study of philosophy is the smashing of idealism and the establishment of materialism, and the collapse of the concept of theocracy. Many places carried out great debates on "theism and atheism." The masses who had studied philosophy used facts and reasoning to thoroughly expose and criticize the deceptive tricks of superstitious professionals such as geomancers, fortune-tellers, and witches. These superstitious professionals had to admit their mistakes in the face of facts. The combination of full-time teachers and worker-peasant mass teachers.
    Cadres and the masses studying philosophy is a large-scale popularization of philosophy, if we only rely on a small number of teaching backbones, without a strong, large number of activists emerging from the masses as the basic force of teaching is not possible. While strengthening the leadership of this movement, the Lai'an County Party Committee, according to the principles of those who are able are teachers, mutual teaching and learning, and the mass line, adopted the method of combining full-time and part-time, intellectuals and worker-peasant masses, and cultivated a large number of mass theoretical teaching teams. The County Party Committee first transferred 50 cadres and excellent primary school teachers from the county's directly affiliated organs and schools, and invited more than 60 teachers and students from the Bengbu Prefectural Party School to form a short and capable full-time teaching team. Then, with them as the backbone, they went to various townships to run short-term training courses, training more than 2,000 worker-peasant theoretical teachers. After returning, this teaching team gave philosophy lessons in rural areas, factories, schools, and organs, so that the universal development of philosophy learning was guaranteed. Because farmer philosophy teachers are generally the backbone of the commune team, party, league, and activists, they are familiar with local conditions, can better integrate with reality, teach in a simple and easy-to-understand way, and are very popular with the masses. Experience has proved that letting go of the cultivation of theoretical teaching teams that combine full-time and part-time, intellectuals and worker-peasant masses can not only effectively break the masses' mysterious views on studying philosophy, making the movement of cadres and the masses studying philosophy quickly develop and persist, but also facilitate them to learn from each other's strengths, learn from each other, and improve together.
    Using a variety of forms for teaching
    Cadres and the masses studying philosophy is an integral part of socialist and communist education, and also a mass self-education movement. In teaching methods, it is necessary to carry out a variety of teaching activities. Lai'an County has made many creations in this regard. They have radio lectures and large report meetings, as well as small-scale teaching activities of dozens of people or three or five people. The fields, construction sites, canteens, and conference venues are their classrooms. Sometimes they lecture while visiting and experimenting. For example, teachers in Shiguan Township lecture on philosophy in satellite fields, studying the reasons for high yields while lecturing on subjective initiative. The masses reflected that this can both liberate the mind and learn methods. They have also held more than ten debates on issues such as "theism and atheism" and "who suffers and who benefits," with the participation of 1,000 to 2,000 people. At the same time, small forums are often held, and in the process of airing views and debating, the masses are mobilized to write big-character posters. What is particularly worth mentioning is that Lai'an County has universally held exhibitions of learning philosophy physical materials from the county to the township, using physical objects, models, charts, and other forms to explain philosophical principles from all aspects, making it easy for people to understand at a glance. This is a new creation. They used the achievements of the county's and township's great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the development of cultural and educational undertakings, and the improvement of people's lives to illustrate the principle that "things are developing"; they used the inventions and creations of the masses and the physical objects of changing low yields to high yields to illustrate the truth that "it is up to people to do things, people will conquer nature" and the transformation of contradictions; they used the combination of industrial and agricultural production and the models and charts of urban and rural cooperation to illustrate that "things are universally connected"; they also moved the bronze Buddha statues, clay Bodhisattvas, charms, compasses, incense burners, and other superstitious items handed over by fortune-tellers, geomancers, witches, and the masses who used to believe in ghosts and gods into the exhibition hall, contrasting them with some charts and instruments of natural science, powerfully explaining that "the world is material, and there are no gods and ghosts." This kind of exhibition hall not only dispelled the masses' mysterious concepts of studying philosophy, but also effectively spread cultural and scientific knowledge. Therefore, many masses visit every day, and the impact is great.

    Of course, it is a relatively long process for the broad masses to deeply understand and skillfully apply Marxist philosophy. Therefore, we should pay attention to the regular work of philosophy teaching, constantly cultivate the learning backbones that emerge in the movement, and continue to carry out some necessary basic knowledge education in combination with reality; at present, it is particularly necessary to closely combine the study and publicity of the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee with the study of philosophy. Only in this way can the broad masses better understand philosophical principles and the party's policies, so that socialist and communist education can be closely combined with reality, and the masses' theoretical study can be further popularized and improved.

    哲学大普及　思想大解放
    安徽来安县组织干部和群众学哲学的经验
    中共安徽省委宣传部副部长　张春汉
    安徽省来安县从去年8月下旬开始，紧密地结合着社会主义和共产主义教育，在全县范围内，开展了一个干部和群众学哲学的运动。几个月来，广大群众已经初步学习了物质与意识的关系、办事要从实际出发、人的主观能动作用、事物的普遍联系和发展、主要矛盾和次要矛盾、以及两类不同性质的矛盾等哲学常识。哲学的确显著提高了干部和群众的思想，成为他们进行自我教育的精神武器。
      县委重视对学习的领导
    来安县委对群众的思想政治教育非常重视，他们不是把工作和思想教育对立起来，而是认为工作愈紧张，问题就愈多，就愈要做好思想政治工作。他们把组织干部和群众学哲学作为思想政治教育的重要内容，所以，县委在迎接人民公社化高潮的同时，作出了关于开展一个学哲学运动的决议，以此来推动人民公社的建立，促进工农业生产的大跃进。在学习运动全面开展后，县委又加强对运动的组织领导、思想领导和教学指导工作。在教学指导方面，县委经常研究教学中存在的问题，适时地提出每一阶段的教学内容和辩论中心，使得哲学学习步步深入。县委和乡党委的第一书记，不但亲自参与这一运动的领导，而且带头学、带头教、带头宣传。
  密切联系实际　推动工作和生产
    劳动人民学哲学的目的，是为政治服务，为生产服务，因此，在整个教学过程中，就必须紧密地结合中心工作，结合当前生产，使哲学学习立竿见影，推动工作，推动生产。来安县的经验正是这样。他们在开展全民学哲学时，正值人民公社化高潮，县里的哲学讲师团，也就是办社工作团，一面帮助办公社，一面向群众讲哲学，运用哲学原理宣传人民公社的优越性。当群众懂得事物都是不断发展的，人民公社比高级社有更多的优越性的时候，便纷纷打报告主动要求办公社。他们说：“事物是发展的，革命是不断的，人民公社是脚踩楼梯步步高，我们不能停在楼半腰”。在大力支援钢铁元帅上马时，哲学讲师团便运用抓主要矛盾的原理宣传以钢为纲的重大意义，大大地推动了大搞钢铁的运动。再如玉明乡过去工作很落后，某些基层干部政治思想不纯，混淆了两类不同性质的矛盾，因而地、富、反、坏分子的反动气焰嚣张，群众生产情绪低落。哲学讲师团在那里讲哲学时，就着重讲两类不同性质的矛盾，边教学边整社，发动群众向不法的地主、富农开展斗争，同时正确地处理人民内部矛盾，大力领导生产，从而伸张了正气，压倒了邪气，使该乡工作面貌焕然一新，由落后变成先进，在三秋工作中成了全县的先进单位。广大基层干部通过哲学学习，思想觉悟大大提高，工作作风显著改进，突出地表现在工作方法讲究了，简单生硬的作风减少了。过去不少基层干部，觉得任务重，头绪多，办法少，往往眉毛胡子一把抓，给工作造成损失。施官乡杜戴大队支部书记黄朝玉，在去年夏天大麦成熟时，本来应该收割，而他却把主要劳动力分配去铲草皮，结果下了一阵冰雹，把一千多亩大麦打光。当时有人批评他，他思想不通，还说：“老天爷下雹子与我无关”。这次他学过“主要矛盾和次要矛盾”以后，懂得“刨树挖总根，工作抓中心”的道理，主动检查了自己的错误。
    来安县群众学哲学还有一个显著的收获，就是大破唯心主义，大立唯物主义，神权观念土崩瓦解。很多地方开展“有神和无神”的大辩论，学过哲学的群众，摆事实，讲道理，彻底揭露和批判了阴阳先生、算命先生、巫婆等迷信职业者骗人的鬼把戏。这些迷信职业者在在事实面前不得不服输认错。专职教员和工农群众教员相结合
    干部和群众学哲学是一次规模宏大的哲学普及工作，如果只依靠少数教学骨干，而没有一支强大的、人数众多的、从群众中涌现出来的积极分子作为教学的基本力量是不行的。来安县委在加强对这一运动的领导的同时，根据能者为师，互教互学，群众路线的原则，采取专职和兼职并举，知识分子和工农群众相结合的办法，大量地培养群众性的理论教学队伍。县委首先从县直属机关和学校中抽调了五十名干部和优秀的小学教师，并请蚌埠地委党校支援六十多名教员和学生，共同组成一支短小精悍的专职教学队伍，然后以他们为骨干，分别到各乡开办短期训练班，共训练了二千多名工农理论教员。这支教学队伍回去后分别在农村、工厂、学校和机关大讲哲学课，这样就使学习哲学普遍开展有了保证。由于农民哲学教员一般都是社队骨干，党、团、积极分子，他们熟悉当地情况，能较好地联系实际，讲课通俗易懂，很受群众欢迎。经验证明，放手地培养专职与兼职、知识分子与工农群众相结合的理论教学队伍，不但能有效地破除群众学哲学的神秘观点，使得干部和群众学哲学运动迅速地开展起来并坚持下去，同时也便利他们取长补短，互相学习，共同提高。
    利用多种多样的形式进行教学
    干部和群众学哲学，是社会主义和共产主义教育的一个组成部分，也是群众的自我教育运动。在教学方法上，必须开展多种多样的教学活动。来安县在这方面的创造是很多的。他们有广播讲座，大报告会，也有几十人或三、五人的小型的教学活动。田头、工地、食堂、会场都是他们的课堂。有时边讲课边参观边实验。又如施官乡教员在卫星田里讲哲学，一面研究高产的原因，一面讲主观能动作用；群众反映，这样既能解放思想，又能学到办法。他们还前后开过十余次一、二千人参加的关于“有神无神”“谁吃亏谁沾光”等问题的辩论大会。同时，也经常举行小型座谈会，在鸣放辩论过程中，发动群众大写大字报。特别值得提出的是，来安县从县到乡都普遍举办了学习哲学实物资料展览馆，以实物、模型、图表等各种形式，从各方面来说明哲学原理，叫人一看就懂，这是一个新创造。他们以本县本乡工农业生产大跃进的成果，文教事业的发展人民生活的提高，来说明“事物是发展的”原理；以群众的发明创造和低产变高产的实物，来说明“事在人为，人定胜天”和矛盾转化的道理；以工农业生产的结合和城乡进行协作的模型和挂图，来说明“事物是普遍联系的”；他们还将算命先生、阴阳先生、巫婆和过去迷信鬼神的群众等交出来的铜佛像、泥菩萨、符咒、罗盘、香炉等各种迷信用品搬进了展览馆，与自然科学的一些挂图、仪器相对照，有力地说明了“世界是物质的，神鬼是没有的”。这种展览馆，既破除了群众对学哲学的神秘观念，又有效地传播了文化科学知识，所以，每天都有很多群众去参观，影响很大。
    当然，马克思主义哲学为广大群众深刻体会和熟练的运用，还是一个比较长期的过程。因此，应该注意哲学教学的经常工作，不断培养在运动中涌现出来的学习骨干，并结合实际继续进行一些必要的基础知识教育；在目前来说，特别需要把学习宣传中央六中全会的决议和学习哲学密切结合起来。这样才能使广大群众更好地理解哲学原理和党的方针政策，使得社会主义和共产主义教育能密切结合实际，使群众的理论学习能进一步地普及和提高。
