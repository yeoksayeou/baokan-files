    He is my good comrade-in-arms in the same class,
    Our feelings are very deep,
    We eat from the same mess tin,
    And rinse our mouths with water from the same tank,
    When he stands guard, he brings me cotton-padded clothes,
    When marching, I sew buttons for him,
    At dusk, we carry water to water the vegetables,
    He lifts the front, I lift the back.
    You say he is a general?
    Oh—he is my good comrade-in-arms in the same class!

    He is my good comrade-in-arms in the same class,
    Our temperaments are very compatible,
    When we're free, we chat about family matters,
    Laughing and talking without end,
    He tells me what's on his mind,
    And I hold nothing back either,
    Once I had a little spat,
    He persuaded me for most of the night.
    You say he is a general?
    Oh—he is my good comrade-in-arms in the same class!

    他是我同班的好战友
    章明他是我同班的好战友，我们的感情很深厚，一个菜盆同吃饭，一缸清水同漱口，站岗他给我送棉衣，行军我替他缝钮扣，黄昏时抬水去浇菜，他抬前头我抬后头。你说他是一位将军？哦——他是我同班的好战友！他是我同班的好战友，我们的脾气很相投，闲来就把家常唠，又说又笑没个够，他有话儿就对我说，我有心事也不保留，有一次我闹了点小别扭，他劝我劝了多半宿。你说他是一位将军？哦——他是我同班的好战友！
