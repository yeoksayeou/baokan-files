Xinhua News Agency, Minsk, 13th – TASS reported from Minsk on the 12th: Many collective farms in Belarus have, from the beginning of this year, transitioned from a remuneration system based on work-days to a unified monetary labor remuneration system for farmers.

Now, after completing their daily labor quotas, collective farmers are paid according to six wage grades based on their skill level, the complexity of the work, and the degree of mechanization. Team leaders and specialized personnel are paid based on their level of education. These payments are made monthly. Previously, collective farmers received remuneration in the form of goods and cash based on their daily completion of specific tasks.

After the implementation of the new remuneration system, collective farmers can use a portion of their wages to purchase products specifically sold to them by the farm at prices lower than market prices.

The reason why collective farms in Belarus are able to adopt the new remuneration system is due to the rapid growth of publicly owned wealth in the republic's collective farms. In the past five years, the income of collective farms has almost tripled, exceeding 4 billion rubles.

In order to pay collective farmers cash on a monthly basis, collective farms have established working capital in addition to the income earned from the sale of products. The working capital of many farms has reached 500,000 rubles.

Monthly cash remuneration will be finalized at the end of the year. At that time, in addition to the expenditure of production and cultural-living funds, the remaining funds in the net income will be distributed to collective farmers in proportion to their wages and the performance of each work team in completing its production and financial tasks.

    苏联白俄罗斯许多集体农庄  
    开始采用六级工资制
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社明斯克12日讯：白俄罗斯许多集体农庄已经由今年年初开始从按劳动日计算的报酬制过渡到农民统一货币劳动报酬制。
    现在，集体农民在完成每天的劳动定额后，依据他们的熟练程度、工作的复杂性和机械化程度按六个工资等级付予报酬，而工作队队长和专门人材则还要依据他们的教育程度来付给报酬。这些报酬均按月付给。在这以前，集体农民是依据他们每日完成一定的工作而取得实物和现金报酬的。
    实行新的报酬制度以后，集体农民可以用一部分工资来购买本农庄专门售给他们的产品，这些产品的价格比市价低。
    白俄罗斯集体农庄之所以能够采用新的报酬制度，是由于共和国集体农庄公有财富迅速增长了，最近五年中，集体农庄的收入差不多增加了三倍，超过了四十亿卢布。
    集体农庄为了按月付给集体农民现金，除了出售产品所获得的收入外，还建立了流动资金。许多农庄的流动资金达到五十万卢布。
    每月的现金报酬到年终还要决算，那时除了生产和文化—生活基金的款项支出外，纯收入中所剩下的款项还将根据集体农民的工资和每个工作队完成生产财政任务的情况按照比例分配给集体农民。
