Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 5th: The Soviet "Pravda" published on January 29th the speech of Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti at the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the full text of which is as follows:

Comrade Delegates! Dear friends! (Applause) On behalf of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party, I salute the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU)! (Applause) On behalf of the more than two million Italian communists and communist youth league members, on behalf of the nearly seven million Italian citizens who voted for us in the recent parliamentary elections, and on behalf of that part of the Italian people who cherish deep friendship, love, and gratitude for your country and your cause, I extend warm brotherly greetings. They know that you are a socialist country, and your cause is to increase the welfare of the people of all countries and promote the cause of democracy and peace. (Applause)

We have experienced difficult times in our activities in recent years, and sometimes we have had to struggle under difficult circumstances. But we overcame these difficulties and achieved spiritual and political victories. Those who fabricated the so-called crisis of our party have been miserably disappointed. They themselves are now broken and crushed. (Applause)

The characteristic of the clericals and right-wing social democratic leaders is to try to make our party despised and to try to exclude it from the democratic forces. But now the government they have organized is itself despised by the people. The discontent of the working masses and the government's incompetence in proposing and solving major problems in our country's economic and social life have led to the government's bankruptcy. At the same time, the signs of a very deep economic and political crisis in our country are maturing.

The reactionary forces in Italy and other Western European countries are planning and brewing a broad offensive, which is a most dangerous situation that we should be particularly wary of now. The instigators and organizers of this offensive are the big monopoly capital. To achieve this goal, they are using all kinds of parties, from the traditional bourgeois parties to the right-wing social democrats, from the so-called Catholic parties to the fascist or quasi-fascist parties. This offensive against democratic freedoms aims to limit and abolish the role of parliament as a representative body of the people's power and threatens the independence of our country. Under the pretext of establishing a unified market of six Western European countries, the economies of some relatively underdeveloped countries are controlled by West German big capital. This threatens the living standards of the working masses and puts both industry and agriculture in a very dangerous and urgent state.

The responsibility we bear at this moment is very great. The cause of peace, democracy, and national independence must today be in the hands of the working class and its organized vanguard. We have never seen so clearly as today how important it is to affirm and emphasize this point. But it is not enough to just affirm and emphasize this point without embodying it in the party's mass daily struggles. This mass daily struggle can establish close ties with all strata of the working people and can organize them on a democratic basis to wage a tenacious struggle for their own interests and peace.

You, Soviet comrades, are summarizing achievements, victories, and inspiring results in moving along the road to communism at your congress. The new seven-year plan for the development of the Soviet economy unfolds new prospects not only before you but also before the working class of the whole world and before all mankind. This prospect gives people a very deep impression and is amazing. While conquering the universe, you are also conquering the hearts of all mankind. (Stormy and prolonged applause) This is a thorough and devastating blow to the quack scholars and lackeys of capitalism and imperialism, who have been clamoring desperately for a long time, saying that it is impossible to establish an economy and a society in which there is no longer exploitation of man by man, and in which social wealth belongs to the people and is used by the people only for the benefit of the people.

From the very beginning of your victorious construction of a socialist society, socialism has shown its clear superiority over capitalism. This has been proven both in peacetime and in wartime, in the process of peaceful construction and in the period of defending the achievements that benefit all the people.

Today you are posing a new challenge to the old capitalist world. We know that with your efforts, with the efforts of the people's democratic countries who are working to build a new society in one-third of the world, with the efforts of the Communist Party and Workers' Party of the great People's Republic of China, this time you will certainly be the victors. (Stormy and prolonged applause) Socialism will become the dominant economic and political system in the world.

This new leap forward by you is also opening up new prospects for us in our country, making the influence of socialism, socialist principles, the practical achievements of socialism, and the organized ranks of socialism more and more widely expanded.

If we think that since you are moving forward with such confidence and so rapidly, we can sit back and wait for the future that will inevitably prove our righteousness, that would be wrong. This attitude is extremely wrong. We know that every new victory of yours is a victory for our common cause in the world. But we also know that to make our people and our country stand on the side of socialism and communism, the most important thing for us is to work hard and struggle with our own strength under our own conditions. We should do everything possible to defend and expand democratic and parliamentary freedoms. We must repel the offensive of big monopoly capital. We must take all necessary measures and political actions to enable all those who are threatened by this offensive to cooperate, so as to limit the power of big monopoly capital, isolate the most reactionary political forces, strive to improve the living standards of the urban and rural working people, and implement some profound political and economic reforms that should be able to open up a path for us towards socialism. (Stormy applause)

Today, our task is the same as the task facing the working class and democratic forces in Western European countries who are unwilling to let this region of Europe be completely turned into an imperialist military base.

The unity of action of the working class and the democratic forces is a necessary condition for eliminating the danger of fascism, maintaining peace, defending the democratic system, and ensuring democratic development and social progress.

Comrades! Your 20th Congress, held almost three years ago, opened a new period that has great significance not only for the development of Soviet society and your party, but also for our entire movement. The resolutions of the 20th Congress and the principles declared in the Moscow Declaration of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties are a valuable contribution to the work of all of us. They have enhanced the unity of our ranks and strengthened the solidarity of our ranks. They give us the strength and ability to better fight our enemies, they help us build new friendly ties, conduct an effective struggle against revisionism and dogmatism, defend the purity of our doctrine, and strengthen the proletarian internationalist spirit of our ranks. At the same time, they help us develop Marxist-Leninist doctrine and apply it in today's new conditions, so that our party can maintain and strengthen its position as a mass party that has inherited the fine traditions of the Italian people and is capable of independently guiding the working class and the people on the road to democracy and socialism.

Therefore, comrades, we fully support the part of Comrade Khrushchev's report that elaborates on the principles of relations between communist parties and workers' parties in various countries.

Your example, your achievements were, and still are, the decisive factor in all our past development, whether in the difficult period of underground struggle, the post-war period, or today. But we always strive to make ourselves understand that your example and a better grasp of the truths of Marxism-Leninism will help us work and advance better and fight for socialism autonomously in our country. The road of history is not predetermined. Every nation has its own creative, revolutionary talent, and the party of the working class should be able to identify and be good at encouraging and developing this talent in order to accomplish the great tasks they face.

Comrades, I wish your congress a successful work, I wish your party a successful work, I wish the people of all nationalities fraternally united in the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics a successful work. We know that you will surely achieve new decisive and great victories. We want to do everything in our power to make the Italian working class and people make the greatest contribution in the struggle for peace and socialism. (Stormy and prolonged applause).

Long live the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union! (Applause)

Long live the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a model of our boundless loyalty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, an invincible fighter for the liberation of labor, for the establishment of a new human society of equality and freedom! (Applause)

Long live the international solidarity of the working people in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism!
(Stormy and prolonged applause, all stand up).

    意大利共产党总书记
    陶里亚蒂在苏共代表大会上的讲话
    新华社莫斯科5日电　苏联“真理报”1月29日刊载了意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂在苏共第二十一次代表大会上的讲话，全文如下：
    代表同志们！亲爱的朋友们！（掌声）我代表意大利共产党中央委员会向苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会致敬，（掌声）我代表二百多万意大利共产党员和共青团员，代表在最近议会选举中投我们票的近七百万意大利公民，代表对你们国家和你们的事业怀着深厚友谊、热爱和感激心情的那一部分意大利人民致以热烈的兄弟的敬礼。他们知道，你们是社会主义国家，你们的事业在增进各国人民的福利，促进民主和和平事业。（掌声）
    我们最近几年来经历了自己活动中的困难时期，有时得在艰难的情况下进行斗争。但是我们克服了这些困难，取得了精神上和政治上的胜利。捏造所谓我们党的危机的人们已悲惨地失望了。他们自己现在已弄得骨断筋折了。
    （掌声）教权派和右翼社会民主党头子们的特色就是竭力使我们的党受鄙视并竭力想把它从民主力量中排挤出去。但是现在他们组织的政府本身却遭到了人们的鄙视。劳动群众的不满，政府在提出和解决我国经济与社会生活中重大问题时所表现的无能，这些因素导致了政府的破产。同时我国的一次非常深刻的经济和政治危机的征象正在成熟。
    意大利和西欧其他国家的反动势力正在策划和酝酿一场广泛的进攻，这是现在我们应该特别当心的一个最危险的情况。这场进攻的鼓动者和组织者就是大垄断资本。他们为达到这个目的正在利用从传统的资产阶级政党直到右翼社会民主党人，从所谓天主教政党直到法西斯政党或准法西斯政党的形形色色的政党。这场针对民主自由的进攻，目的是要限制和取消议会作为人民力量代表机关的作用、并威胁我们国家的独立。在建立西欧六国统一市场的借口下，一些比较不发达国家的经济被西德大资本所控制。这就使劳动群众的生活水平受到威胁，并使工农业都处于非常危险和紧急的状态中。
    此刻我们所担负的责任非常重大。和平、民主和民族独立的事业今天必须掌握在工人阶级及其有组织的先锋队的手中，我们从来还没有像今天这样清楚地看到，肯定并强调这一点是多么重要。但是如果只是这样肯定和强调，而不使其体现在党的具有群众性的日常斗争中，那也是不够的。这种群众性的日常斗争能够建立同劳动人民所有阶层的密切联系，并能在民主基础上把他们组织起来，为自己的利益和和平进行顽强的斗争。
    你们，苏联同志们，正在你们的代表大会上总结着成就、胜利和沿着通往共产主义的道路前进的鼓舞人心的成果。发展苏联经济的新的七年计划不仅在你们面前，而且在全世界工人阶级面前，在全人类面前展开了新的前景。这种前景，给予人们以极深的印象，令人惊叹不已。你们在征服宇宙的同时，也征服了全人类的心。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）这是对冒牌学者、资本主义和帝国主义的走卒的一个彻底而毁灭性打击，这些人长时期来一直在拼命叫嚷，说建立不再有人剥削人现象的、社会财富属于人民并由人民用来只为人民谋福利的那种经济和那种社会是不可能的。
    从你们一开始胜利的建设社会主义社会的时候起，社会主义就表明了它对资本主义的明显优越性。不论在和平条件下还是在战争时期，在和平建设过程中还是在保卫造福全民的成果的时期，都证明是如此。
    今天你们向资本主义旧世界提出了新的挑战，我们知道，靠你们的努力，靠正在世界三分之一的地区致力于建设新社会的人民民主国家、伟大的中华人民共和国的共产党和工人党的努力，这一次你们一定还是胜利者。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）社会主义将成为在全世界占优势的经济和政治体系。
    你们这一新的飞跃前进也在我们的国家，为我们打开了新的前景，使社会主义、社会主义原则、社会主义的实际成就和社会主义有组织的队伍的影响，越来越广泛地扩大。
    如果我们认为，既然你们这样满怀信心地、这样迅速地前进，我们就可以坐待必然会证明我们的正义性的将来，那就是不对的。这种态度是极端错误的。我们知道，你们每一个新的胜利都是我们共同事业在全世界的胜利。但是我们也知道，要使我国人民和我们国家站在社会主义和共产主义一边，首先需要我们在我们的条件下用自己的力量去努力和斗争，这一点对我们来说是最重要的。我们应当全力保卫并尽可能地扩大民主和议会自由。我们必须打退大垄断资本的进攻。我们必须采取一切必要的措施和政治行动，使受到这一进攻威胁的所有人士都能合作，从而限制大垄断资本的权力，孤立最反动的政治势力，争取提高城乡劳动人民的生活水平，并实行一些深刻的政治和经济改革，这类改革应当能为我们开辟走向社会主义的道路。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    今天我们的任务正同西欧各国不愿让欧洲这一地区彻底变成帝国主义军事基地的工人阶级和民主力量面临的任务一样。
    工人阶级和民主力量的行动的一致，乃是消除法西斯危险，维护和平、保卫民主制度、保证民主发展和社会进步的必要条件。
    同志们！你们在差不多三年以前举行的第二十次代表大会开辟了一个新的时期，这个时期不仅对于苏维埃社会和你们的党的发展有着巨大的意义，而且对我们的整个运动也是如此。第二十次代表大会的决议以及共产党和工人党代表的莫斯科会议宣言中所宣布的原则，是对我们大家的工作作出的宝贵贡献。它们提高了我们队伍的一致性，加强了我们队伍的团结。它们给予我们以力量和能力来更好地同我们的敌人进行斗争，它们帮助我们建立新的友好联系，对修正主义和教条主义进行有效的斗争，保卫我们学说的纯洁性和加强我们队伍的无产阶级国际主义精神。同时它们帮助我们发展马克思列宁主义学说和在今天新的条件下运用这一学说，以使我们党能够保持和加强作为继承了意大利人民的优良传统、有能力独立地引导工人阶级和人民走民主和社会主义道路的群众性大党的地位。
    因此，同志们，我们完全拥护赫鲁晓夫同志报告中阐述各国共产党、工人党之间关系的原则的那一部分。
    你们的范例，你们的成果以前是、现在仍然是我们过去全部发展的决定性因素，无论是在艰苦的地下斗争时期、战后时期以及今天都是如此。但是我们永远努力使自己懂得，你们的范例和对马克思列宁主义真理的更好地掌握，将帮助我们更好地工作和前进，并在我国自主地为社会主义而斗争。历史的道路并不是预先就规定好的。每一个民族有它自己创造性的，革命的才能，而工人阶级的政党应当能够鉴识、并善于鼓励和发展这种才能，以便完成他们面临的伟大任务。
    同志们，我祝你们的代表大会工作顺利，祝你们党工作顺利，祝兄弟般地团结在伟大的苏维埃共和国联盟中的各族人民工作顺利。我们知道，你们一定会取得新的决定性的伟大胜利。我们要尽我们的一切力量使意大利的工人阶级和人民在争取和平和社会主义的斗争中作出最大的贡献。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）。
    苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会万岁！（掌声）
    我们大家的对马克思列宁主义原则无限忠诚的模范、争取劳动解放、争取建立平等和自由的人类新社会的无敌战士——伟大的苏联共产党万岁！（掌声）
    劳动人民在争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中的国际团结万岁！
  （暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声，全体起立）。
