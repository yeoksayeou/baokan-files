Several Important Features of the Capitalist World Economy in 1958
Varga (Soviet Union)

1958 (a year of victories for Soviet economy, science, and technology) was for the capitalist world a year of economic crisis, sharpening of imperialist contradictions, and accelerated collapse of the colonial system.

The world economic crisis began in 1956 in underdeveloped raw material producing countries. In December 1956, the industrial output value of the United States reached its highest point: 147 (the average level of 1947-1949 being 100). This economic crisis, like any crisis in capitalist history, has a series of characteristics. Now we will talk about some of the most important features.

	Large Monopoly Organizations Suffer the Least

The burden of the crisis fell almost entirely on the workers in industrialized countries and on the shoulders of underdeveloped countries, or simply, on the weakest members of the capitalist society's economy. Large monopoly organizations suffered the least from the crisis. The reason is that state monopoly capitalism has gained extensive development since World War II. The power of large monopoly organizations and the power of the states they control are combined. In the past, a large part of the burden of the crisis fell on the bourgeoisie due to the sharp drop in commodity prices, the depreciation of fixed capital, and the bankruptcy of exchanges, etc. Now, in addition to the working people, only the petty bourgeoisie and the middle class suffer from the crisis. Although the crisis may slightly reduce the profits of large monopoly organizations, commodity prices hardly fall, and stock prices only fall for a short period of time before starting to rise again. Now, let’s illustrate this with some statistics from the United States.

		U.S. Wholesale Price Index
		(1953 = 100)	All Commodities	Finished Products	Semi-finished Products	Raw Materials
1955			101		100			103			95
1956			104		103			107			96
1957			107		107			110			98
1958 (Sept.)		108		110			110			99

From this, we can see that, during the crisis, prices as a whole did not fall but rose. However, the price of raw materials (most of which are imported from underdeveloped countries) is now lower than the level of 1953, while the price of finished products has further increased despite the crisis, and is 10% higher than in 1955! At the same time, it must be taken into account that labor productivity has greatly increased due to the vigorous renewal of fixed capital, so the labor time spent on unit commodities is less than before the crisis.

This trend is even more evident in some commodities where monopoly organizations monopolize sales. Currently, the price of steel in the United States is 15% higher than before the start of the economic crisis, although steel mills are only operating at 75% capacity, while one of the important raw materials for producing steel—scrap steel—is now 20% lower than in 1956. The price per pound of aluminum is now several percent higher than in 1956. Even car prices are now higher than before the crisis, although there is fierce competition among large monopoly organizations.

By raising the prices of manufactured goods and simultaneously reducing production costs by suppressing raw material prices, lowering wages, and increasing workers' labor productivity and labor intensity, American monopoly capital has compensated for the losses it suffered from the sharp reduction in production and sales.

		Net Profits of Major U.S. Companies
			(Millions of Dollars)
				3rd Quarter 1957	3rd Quarter 1958
708 Companies		2467			2313
Of which:
23 Oil Product Companies	434			430
32 Iron and Steel Companies	207			154
25 Car Companies		203			235
4 Railroad Companies		155			193

It can be seen that the profits of American big "businessmen" have not changed much overall, and have even increased somewhat. The only exception is the automobile industry. (Note 1) In addition to the fear of inflation, this is also one of the main reasons why the U.S. stock market is now even higher than before the crisis.

	Workers Suffer the Most

What is the impact of the crisis on workers? From September 1957 to September 1958, the number of employed people in the United States decreased by one million, while the officially announced number of fully unemployed people increased by one million six hundred thousand. The number of people belonging to the category of "outside the labor force" has also increased by one million.

In June 1958, when production fell the most severely, the officially acknowledged number of unemployed people reached five million four hundred thousand; and about the same number of people were not getting full work during the work week.

During the crisis, American trade unions waged intense struggles to maintain the level of real wages. However, due to the large number of unemployed people, the short duration of unemployment benefits, and the limited number of people receiving such benefits, the income of the working class has greatly declined. In addition, prices continue to rise. This can be seen from the following table (with 1947-1949 as 100):

				Wages in the Processing Industry Sector	Retail Prices
September 1957					165					121
September 1958					155					124
Change (in percentage)			-6					+2.5

It seems that the actual income of workers in the processing industry sector has decreased by an average of 9% according to official statistics. The decline in the living standards of the working class is actually even more severe, because employed workers have to use their income to support the lives of unemployed workers.

Obviously, all of this will also show up in the later stages of the economic cycle. The investments made in the post-war period (especially in 1955-1956), and partially completed during the crisis, have led to a great increase in labor productivity and a reduction in the number of workers required to produce a certain quantity of products. Obviously, the need for new investment will also decrease.

The amount of new investment decreased from an annual level of 38 billion US dollars (3rd quarter of 1957) to 30 billion US dollars in the same period in 1958. All American economists agree that it will take several years for investment to return to the level before the crisis. Therefore, it should be said that the economic rise after the end of the crisis will be slow and long-term, and large-scale recurring unemployment is threatening the American working class. Of course, this is also related to the rationalization of production technology, which, under capitalist conditions, leads to an increase in the number of unemployed people.

In other industrialized capitalist countries, the working class is also bearing the main burden of the crisis. At the end of 1958, the number of fully unemployed workers in West Germany reached one million, in Britain it exceeded five hundred thousand, and in Italy it was two million. Usually, the poverty caused by large-scale unemployment is somewhat alleviated by the decline in retail prices. Now, on the contrary, the disaster is even greater due to the continuous rise in prices.

		Cost of Living Index
			(1953 = 100)
		United States	West Germany	United Kingdom	France
Sept. 1957		106		107			116			107
Sept. 1958		108		109			119			123

In France, inflation is prolonging the deepening process of the economic crisis, and the working people are facing difficult times. The new regime has increased taxes on consumer goods, gas, electricity, and transportation, devalued the franc, and lowered social insurance standards.

Due to the significant reduction in the purchasing power of the working people, a more severe economic crisis threatens France even more than other Western European countries.

	Sharp Drop in Export Prices of Raw Materials in Underdeveloped Countries

In addition to the proletariat of industrialized countries, the main burden of the world economic crisis also falls on the working people of economically underdeveloped countries. The crisis here occurred earlier than in industrialized countries, because industrialized countries began to reduce their purchases of industrial raw materials long before the overproduction became very obvious.

Economically underdeveloped countries suffer from the crisis for three reasons: due to the sharp drop in the prices of their export commodities, due to the reduction in production, and due to the shortage of foreign exchange. As a result, these countries are unable to import a sufficient quantity of means of production to develop their economies. Now let's give a few examples.

	Price of one ton of copper in London (in pounds):
				1955		1956		Dec. 1957	Feb. 1958	Sept. 1958
				352		329		181		163		209

Malaysia, the world's main producer of tin concentrate, saw its average monthly output of tin concentrate fall from 5,300 tons in 1956 to 3,700 tons in the first half of 1958.

Egyptian high-quality cotton was worth $0.733 per pound in Britain in 1956, but fell to $0.377 in 1958. In Australia, wool was worth 83 pence per pound in May 1957, but fell to 47 pence in September 1958. The prices of some commodities, such as coffee, have only fallen sharply in recent months.

	Imperialist Countries Extract Huge Profits

The fall in the prices of raw materials and grain on the world market mainly benefited those who buy these commodities in bulk—Britain. It can be seen from the following calculations how much profit Britain has obtained at the expense of economically underdeveloped countries.

Britain's total value of raw material imports in 1957 was 1,169 million pounds (London "Economist", published November 22, 1958, page 748). If we take the price index of raw materials imported by Britain in 1954 as 100, it was 110 in 1957. But by the end of November 1958, it had fallen to 92 (London "Economist", published November 29, 1958, page 848), a decrease of 16%, while export prices as a whole remained roughly at the original level. The statistics for the whole year of 1958 are not yet available, but it can be assumed that the price of raw materials as a whole changed by 10% compared with 1957, and this change was beneficial to Britain. That is to say, Britain obtained a profit of 117 million pounds from the import of raw materials from underdeveloped countries simply due to changes in prices in foreign trade!

If we take into account the price drop of oil not included in the raw materials, and the price drop of coffee, oils, sugar, and other foods, the profit obtained from the price drop is at least 150 million pounds, equivalent to 420 million US dollars. This also explains the following striking fact, that Britain's trade and balance of payments turned into a surplus during the crisis, and the monetary situation also improved.

The industrialized countries of continental Europe—West Germany, Belgium, France, and Italy—have also benefited from the fall in raw material prices. (Note 2) For example, West Germany imported 9.4 billion marks of raw materials in 1957. If we calculate the average price drop as 10% as we did for Britain, then West Germany obtained a profit of nearly 1 billion marks in 1957 due to this price drop, which is equivalent to 240 million US dollars. If we take into account the profits obtained by France, Belgium, and Italy, then in the crisis year of 1958, the bourgeoisie of European imperialist countries extracted slightly less than one billion US dollars from economically underdeveloped countries as a result of the price drop of raw materials and food, while maintaining very high monopoly prices for industrial products. This does not include the ordinary exploitation carried out year after year through unequal exchange.

By sacrificing economically underdeveloped countries, the partial free convertibility of Western European currencies was also implemented at the end of 1958. This is the true situation of the "aid" to economically underdeveloped countries that imperialist countries boast about.

However, the serious consequences of the crisis in these countries also threaten industrialized countries. Due to the sharp reduction in export income, economically underdeveloped countries have had to reduce their purchases of industrial products, and even relatively wealthy countries such as Australia and New Zealand have restricted their imports. All of this is deepening the economic crisis in Western Europe.

	Uneven Crisis Development

An important characteristic of the current world economic crisis is that the degree of development of the crisis varies greatly from country to country and from economic sector to sector.

The most severe crisis recession in U.S. production occurred in the spring of 1958, after which the crisis turned into the current period of depression. (Note 3) A decline in production is still entirely possible during this period. However, in the United States, the most severe recession seems to have passed. Western European countries are far from reaching the lowest point of the crisis recession in production. In economically underdeveloped countries, the crisis continues almost unabated.

The crisis has hit the "old" sectors the hardest: coal mining, steelmaking, cotton cloth, and the leather industry, while the "new" sectors such as aircraft manufacturing, atomic energy, electronic instrument manufacturing, and synthetic materials production have hardly been affected by the crisis.

	The Crisis Promotes the Sharpening of Imperialist Contradictions

The crisis has promoted the sharpening of imperialist contradictions. How is this manifested?

The economic position of the United States in the capitalist world is weakening day by day. In 1958, the United States lost two billion US dollars in gold, which benefited the rest of the capitalist world. As a result, capitalist countries eliminated the "dollar shortage" for a certain period of time, and their economic position in dealing with the United States was strengthened.

Resistance to the U.S. intention to maintain its leading position in the capitalist world has strengthened. This is manifested in the crisis of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the main tool of the U.S. policy of strength. Almost all participants in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have expressed dissatisfaction with the Atlantic group. France demanded that the United States, Britain, and itself form a troika of political powers in order to change the situation in which the United States monopolizes power in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Spaak advocated that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should bear some economic tasks, first of all, to provide economic assistance to underdeveloped countries in order to prevent the expansion of Soviet influence.

Some countries have refused to provide sites for setting up medium-range missile installations in accordance with U.S. requirements. These countries are worried that if they agree to U.S. requirements, they will turn their territories into battlefields for atomic war. This worry is completely justified.

The main Western European countries have a contradictory attitude towards the United States.

Britain, in the official policy led by Macmillan, has learned a lesson from the Suez tragedy: it cannot take world-wide action without the support of the United States, therefore, it must succumb to U.S. leadership.

In contrast, De Gaulle hopes to restore France's past glory, turning France into an atomic power so that France can rule the capitalist world on an equal footing.

But this policy may cause conflicts with Anglo-Saxon countries, and as long as France is still fighting a war with the Algerian people, France cannot give up the financial assistance they provide.

At the same time, West Germany's monopoly capital is strengthening and expanding its financial and economic position around the world. It attempts to build the most modern army and demands that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization cannot pass resolutions without Bonn's consent.

It can be seen that 1958 was marked by the sharpening of imperialist contradictions, the weakening of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and thus the weakening of the United States' position.

	Vigorous Development of National Liberation Movements

All these phenomena are inseparable from the surging events taking place in the colonial and dependent countries (which used to be regarded as the capitalist "rear area"). In 1958, national liberation movements gained vigorous development everywhere.

In Africa, national liberation movements swept through areas that imperialists had previously considered completely reliable. Guinea broke away from the status of a French colony, and the flames of rebellion ignited in the Belgian Congo.

Attempts by imperialists to use force to interfere in Middle Eastern affairs (the United States sending troops to Lebanon, Britain sending troops to Jordan) ended in failure. The imperialist troops had to withdraw under the pressure of the people of the Arab countries who had already broken away from imperialism, and had to retreat under the pressure of world opinion.

Despite various conspiracies, despite facing powerful armies, and despite being subjected to brutal repression, the liberation struggle of the colonial people is flourishing and moving towards complete and total victory.

In the context of the economic and political crisis in capitalist countries, the achievements and ever-increasing significance of the Soviet economy are particularly significant.

(Originally published in the Soviet magazine "New Times", No. 5, 1959. The subheadings in the text were added by the editors of this newspaper.)

(Note 1) The reasons for the sharp reduction in the profits of car companies are as follows: The crisis has forced many Americans to reduce their personal spending. The most harmless method is not to buy new cars. Sales of new cars in 1958 were approximately 31% lower than in the previous year. Therefore, the profits of the automobile industry were greatly reduced.

(Note 2) The United States, which has abundant raw material resources of its own, benefited primarily from the fall in the prices of tropical agricultural products such as coffee and sugar cane. This benefit is relatively small in the overall U.S. economy.

(Note 3) The large increase in state spending on armaments, road construction, etc. played a certain role in this regard, and the sharp increase in spending on armaments, road construction, etc. led to a budget deficit of 12 billion to 15 billion US dollars (fiscal year 1958-1959) and also led to inflation, but reduced the degree of the crisis of overproduction in industry.

    1958年资本主义世界经济的几个重要特征 
    苏联　瓦尔加
    1958年（苏联经济和科学技术取得胜利的一年）对于资本主义世界是经济危机、帝国主义矛盾尖锐化和殖民主义体系加速崩溃的一年。
    世界经济危机是1956年在不发达的原料出产国开始的。1956年12月份美国的工业产值达到了最高点：一四七（1947—1949年的平均水平为一百）。这次经济危机也像资本主义历史上的任何一次危机一样具有一系列特点。现在我们就来谈谈其中的几个最重要的特点。
        大垄断组织受害最小
    危机的重担几乎全部压在工业发达国家职工以及不发达国家的肩上，简单地说，压在资本主义社会经济上最软弱分子的肩上。大垄断组织受到的危机祸害最小。原因是，在第二次世界大战以后，国家垄断资本主义获得了广泛的发展。大垄断组织势力和它们所控制的国家的力量合而为一了。在过去，由于商品价格的猛跌、固定资本的跌价、交易所的破产倒闭等等，危机重担的一大部分落在资产阶级的肩上。而现在，除了劳动人民以外，遭受危机祸害的只有小资产阶级和中产阶级。尽管危机也会稍微减少大垄断组织的利润，但商品价格几乎并没有下跌，股票牌价只下跌一个短时期，而后又开始上涨。现在用美国的一些统计数字来加以说明。
          美国的批发价格指数
         （1953年为100）各种商品　成　品　半成品　原　料1955　101　100　103　951956　104　103　107　961957　107　107　110　981958（9月）108　110　110　99
    由此我们可以看出，在危机期间，整个来说，价格并没有下跌，而是上涨了。但是原料（其中大部分是从不发达国家进口的）的价格现在却低于1953年的水平，同时尽管发生了危机，成品价格却进一步上涨了，而且比1955年贵了10％！同时，必须考虑到，由于固定资本的大力更新，劳动生产率大大提高了，因此单位商品所花费的劳动时间比危机前要少。
    从垄断组织垄断销售的一些商品中，可以更加明显地看到这种趋势。目前在美国钢的价格比经济危机开始前高15％，虽然炼钢厂的开工率只有75％，而生产钢的重要原料之一——碎钢现在却比1956年低20％。目前每磅铝的价格要比1956年高百分之几。甚至汽车价格现在也比危机以前要高，虽然大垄断组织之间存在着尖锐的竞争。
    由于抬高制成品价格，并同时依靠压低原料价格，压低工资，提高工人的劳动生产率和劳动强度来减少生产费用，就补偿了美国垄断资本由于生产和销售锐减而遭到的损失。
          美国主要公司的纯利润
                    （百万美元）
                1957年第三季度　1958年第三季度708家公司　2467　2313其中：23家生产石油产品的公司　434　43032家生产生铁和钢的公司　207　15425家生产汽车的公司　203　2354家铁路公司　155　193
    由此可见，美国大“生意人”的利润整个说来变化不大，甚至有所增加。例外的只有汽车工业。（注一）除了害怕通货膨胀以外，这也是现在美国股票行情甚至高于危机以前的主要原因之一。
          工人受害最大
    危机对工人的影响怎样呢？从1957年9月到1958年9月，美国的就业人数减少了一百万人，而官方宣布的完全失业的人数增加了一百六十万人。属于“劳动力以外”范畴的人数也增加了一百万。
    在1958年6月生产下降最厉害的时候，官方承认的失业人数达五百四十万人；而在工作周中得不到完全工作的人大约也有这么多。
    在危机过程中，美国工会为保持实际工资水平进行了紧张的斗争。然而，由于失业人数众多，领失业补助金的期限很短和领到这种补助金只是有限的人，工人阶级的收入就大大下降了。此外，物价在继续上涨。这从下表可以看出（以1947—1949年为100）：
                加工工业部门的工资　零售物价1957年9月　                   165　1211958年9月　                   155　124变化（以百分比计算）          －6　　＋2.5
    由此看来，加工工业部门工人的实际收入据官方统计平均降低了9％。工人阶级生活水平的下降程度实际上还要更加厉害，因为就业工人要用自己的收入来维持失业工人的生活。
    显然，在经济周期的以后各阶段中也会显示出这一切情况。在战后时期（特别是在1955—1956年）所作的，而在危机过程中已部分完成的投资，引起了劳动生产率的大大提高和生产一定数量产品所需要的工人人数的减少。显然，对新投资的需要也要减少。
    新投资的数额从年度水平三百八十亿美元（1957年第三季）下降到1958年同期的三百亿美元。所有美国的经济学家都同意，投资重新达到危机前时期的水平还要经过若干年。因此应该说，在危机结束以后经济的上升将是缓慢的，长期的和经常性的大批失业在威胁着美国工人阶级。当然，这也同生产技术合理化有关，在资本主义条件下，生产技术合理化就导致失业人数的增加。
    在其他工业发达的资本主义国家，工人阶级也都担负着危机的主要重担。在1958年底，西德的全失业工人人数达一百万人，英国超过五十万人，意大利为二百万人。往常，大批失业造成的贫困由于零售价格下降还有一些缓和。而现在则相反，由于物价的不断上涨，灾难就更大。
                生活费用指数
                    （1953年为100）
            美国　西德　英国　法国
  1957年9月　106　107　116　107
  1958年9月　108　109　119　123
    在法国，通货膨胀拖长着经济危机的加深过程，劳动人民正面临着艰难的时刻。新政权提高了对消费品、煤气、电力和运输的课税，实行了法郎贬值，降低了社会保险标准。
    由于劳动人民购买力的大大降低，更剧烈的经济危机对法国比对其他西欧国家的威胁还要大。
    不发达国家出口原料价格猛跌
    除了工业上发达的国家的无产阶级以外，世界经济危机的主要重担还落在经济上不发达国家劳动人民的身上。这里发生的危机早于工业国，因为工业国早在生产过剩还没有变得很明显的时候就开始缩减购买工业原料。
    经济上不发达国家遭受危机是由于三方面的原因：由于它们的出口商品价格猛跌，由于生产缩减和由于外汇不足，结果，这些国家没有能力输入足够数量的生产资料，来发展它们的经济。现在举几个例子。
        伦敦一吨铜的价格，（以英镑计算：）1955年　1956年　1957年12月　1958年2月　1958年9月
  352　  329　   181　       163　      209
    马来亚是世界上锡精矿的主要产地，它平均每月的锡精矿产量从1956年的五千三百吨下降到1958年上半年的三千七百吨。
    埃及的上等棉花1956年在英国每磅值零点七三三美元，而1958年则下跌为零点三七七美元。在澳大利亚1957年5月，每磅羊毛值八十三便士，而1958年9月则跌到四十七便士。某些商品的价格，例如咖啡的价格，只是在最近几个月内才猛跌。　
    帝国主义国家榨取了巨额利润
    世界市场上原料和粮食价格的下跌，主要使这些商品的大买主——英国占了便宜。从下面的计算可以看出英国靠牺牲经济上不发达的国家取得了多么巨大的利润。
    英国在1957年输入的原料总值十一亿六千九百万英镑（1958年11月22日出版的伦敦“经济学家”，七百四十八页）。如果以1954年英国输入的原料价格指数为一百，1957年则是一百一十。但是到1958年11月底，它便降低到九十二（1958年11月29日出版的伦敦“经济学家”，八百四十八页），即降低了16％，而出口价格整个说来大致还保持在原有的水平上。1958年全年的统计数字暂时还没有，但是可以认为，同1957年相比原料价格整个说来变化了10％，这种变化有利于英国。这就是说，仅仅由于对外贸易中价格的变化，英国在从不发达国家进口原料中就得到了一亿一千七百万英镑的利润！
    如果考虑到不包括在原料之内的石油的跌价，考虑到咖啡、油类、糖和其他种食品的跌价，则由于跌价所得到的利润至少为一亿五千万英镑，等于四亿两千万美元。这一点也可以说明下面的引人注目的事实，就是英国的贸易和支付平衡在危机时期倒变为出超，同时货币情况也有所改善。
    大陆欧洲的工业国——西德、比利时、法国和意大利也从原料跌价中得到了好处。（注二）例如，西德1957年进口了九十四亿马克的原料。如果我们像对待英国的情况一样把价格的下跌平均算为10％，则西德在1957年由于这种跌价就得到了将近十亿马克的利润，这等于二亿四千万美元。如果考虑到法国、比利时和意大利所获得的利润，则在危机的1958年，欧洲帝国主义国家的资产阶级在保持工业品很高的垄断价格的同时，由于原料和食品跌价的结果，从经济上不发达的国家榨取了略略少于十亿美元的利润。这里不包括年复一年地通过不等价交换所进行的普通剥削。
    靠牺牲经济上不发达的国家，1958年底还实行了西欧货币的部分自由兑换。帝国主义国家所吹嘘的对经济上不发达国家的“援助”的真实情况就是这样。
    但是，这些国家的危机的严重后果也威胁着工业上发达的国家。经济上不发达的国家由于出口收入的锐减，就不得不减少购买工业品，甚至那些比较富裕的国家，如澳大利亚和新西兰也限制它们的进口。这一切都在加深西欧的经济危机。
    危机发展不平衡
    目前世界经济危机的重要特点是，危机在各个国家和各个经济部门的发展程度非常不平衡。
    美国生产上最剧烈的危机性衰退是在1958年春天出现的，在这以后危机就转入目前的萧条时期。（注三）生产中的衰退在这个时期中还是完全可能的。不过，在美国，最剧烈的衰退看来已经过去了。在西欧国家还远远没有达到生产的危机性衰退的最低点。在经济上不发达的国家里，危机差不多毫不减弱地继续着。
    危机打击得最厉害的是“老的”部门：采煤、炼钢、棉布和皮革工业，而飞机制造业、原子能、电子仪器制造业、合成物质生产等这些“新的”部门却几乎没有受到危机的影响。
    危机促进了帝国主义矛盾尖锐化
    危机促进了帝国主义矛盾的尖锐化。这表现在什么地方呢？
    美国在资本主义世界的经济地位日益削弱。美国1958年损失二十亿美元的黄金，而使其他资本主义世界得到了好处。结果，资本主义国家在一定时期内消除了“美元荒”，它们在同美国打交道时经济地位加强了。
    对于美国想保持资本主义世界领导者地位的意图的反抗加强了。这表现在美国实力政策的主要工具——北大西洋公约组织的危机中。几乎所有参加北大西洋公约组织的人都对大西洋集团表示不满。法国要求由美国、英国和它自己成立一个三巨头政治，以便改变美国在北大西洋公约组织中独揽大权的局面。斯巴克主张由北大西洋公约组织负担一些经济任务，首先就是在经济上援助不发达的国家，以便阻止苏联影响的扩大。
    有些国家拒绝依照美国的要求提供设置中程火箭装置的场地。这些国家担心，同意美国的要求，它们就将把自己的国土变为原子战争的战场。这种担心是完全正当的。
    主要的西欧国家对待美国的立场是互相矛盾的。
    英国在麦克米伦领导的官方政策中从苏伊士的悲剧得出了经验教训：没有美国的支持它不能采取世界性的行动，因此，它必须屈从于美国的领导。
    与此相反，戴高乐却希望恢复法国往昔的威风，把法国变为一个原子大国，以便使法国在平等的基础上统治资本主义世界。
    但是这个政策可能引起同盎格鲁—撒克逊国家的冲突，只要法国还在同阿尔及利亚人民进行战争，法国就不能放弃它们给予的财政援助。
    同时，西德的垄断资本正在世界各地加强和扩大它的财政地位和经济地位。它企图建立最现代化的军队，并且要求北大西洋公约组织不经波恩的同意就不能通过决定。
    由此可见，1958年的标志是，帝国主义的矛盾尖锐化了，北大西洋公约组织削弱了，从而美国的地位也削弱了。
      民族解放运动蓬勃发展
    所有这些现象同殖民地附属国（它们过去曾经被当作是资本主义的“大后方”）中所发生的汹涌澎湃的事态是分不开的。在1958年，哪里的民族解放运动获得了蓬勃的发展。
    在非洲，民族解放运动席卷了不久以前帝国主义者还认为是完全可靠的地区。几内亚摆脱了法国殖民地的地位，在比属刚果燃起了起义的火焰。
    帝国主义者用武力干涉中东事务（美国出兵黎巴嫩，英国出兵约旦）的尝试都以失败而告终。帝国主义者的军队不得不在已经摆脱了帝国主义的阿拉伯各国人民的压力下撤走，不得不在世界舆论的压力下退却。
    尽管有人采取种种阴谋，尽管面对着强大的军队，尽管受到残酷的镇压，但是殖民地人民的解放斗争正在蓬勃发展，正在走向彻底和完全的胜利。
    在资本主义国家经济和政治危机的情况下，苏联经济的成就和不断高涨的意义就特别显著了。

      （注一）汽车公司利润锐减的原因如下：危机迫使许多美国人减少自己的个人支出。最无害的方法是不买新汽车。1958年新汽车的销售量比前一年大约低31％。因此，汽车工业的利润就大为减少。
      （注二）本国拥有丰富原料资源的美国，首先是从热带农产品如咖啡、蔗糖等等价格的下跌中得到了好处。在美国整个经济中这一点好处相对说来不算很大。
      （注三）国家用于武装、建设公路等等方面的费用大大增加，在这方面起了一定的作用，而用于武装、建设公路等等方面费用的急剧增加导致了预算赤字一百二十亿至一百五十亿美元（1958—1959财政年度），还导致了通货膨胀，但是减低了工业生产过剩的危机的程度。
