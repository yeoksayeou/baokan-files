Grasp the Commander's Seal Well

The Party instructs us: The current rural work should be led by fertilizer. This is entirely in line with the actual situation of the current rural work. The secretary of the rural Party committee is currently focusing on fertilizer.

The correct policy of the secretary taking the lead and launching a large-scale mass movement was further clarified in last year's Great Leap Forward. The broad masses have realized that nothing can be accomplished without the leadership of the Party. Therefore, it is inevitable to consciously rely on the leadership of the Party, to demand that the secretary take the lead in solving specific problems in the work, and to accelerate the pace of socialist construction. It can be affirmed that the secretary taking the lead, the whole Party taking action, and strengthening the Party's leadership are the fundamental guarantees for completing all revolutionary tasks.

However, in the current rural Party grassroots organizations, another situation has also emerged, that is, a small number of cadres from some work departments who come to work in the countryside do not use their brains much, do not go deep into specific work, and require the "secretary to take the lead" in solving all minor problems. Regardless of the time, place, task, urgency, they surround the secretary and force the "commander to make decisions." They insist on forcing some things that they should be responsible for and tasks that can be postponed onto the secretary alone, to be done immediately, and the secretary must do it himself, as if only in this way can the secretary take the lead. This has made some secretaries breathless. One branch secretary said: "The work is as chaotic as hemp, the commander's seal is not easy to grasp, running around all day, grabbing here and grabbing there." Chen Guoping, the Party branch secretary of a production team in Chunguang Commune, said: "I have to take the lead in this, I have to take the lead in that. The school has no stones to build a house, the nursery has no balls to play with, the veterinarian collects medicine fees, and the feeders want to slaughter pigs and they all come to me to take the lead and do it myself. How can I grasp so many commander's seals?"

This situation makes the secretary fall into the circle of affairs, unable to see the essence of the problem, unable to grasp the mainstream of the movement, and instead affects the solution of important problems. In this way, it does not strengthen the unified leadership of the Party, but disperses the Party's leadership energy, weakens the Party's leadership, and is not conducive to the enthusiasm of the masses, nor is it conducive to the cadres' growth of their talents in practical training.

To do a good job of the secretary taking the lead, we must first see clearly the two aspects of "taking the lead": one is that the secretary personally takes action, sits down and drills into it, specifically analyzes the situation, solves problems together with the masses, and constantly summarizes work and promotes experience. The second is that the secretary must be good at grasping the main contradictions and focusing on the center according to the development of the objective situation, doing a good job of the Party's political and ideological work, strengthening the Party's leadership over all work, commanding the armies in all aspects, and achieving unified leadership, overall arrangement, and division of labor and responsibility. This means that on the one hand, the secretary must go into battle and participate in production to lead production; on the other hand, he must get rid of daily trivial affairs, jump out of the circle of affairs, and directly grasp ideology, production, and life. Currently, the secretary must take charge of the fertilizer work. Only by grasping this center can we drive other work.

Of course, to achieve a greater and more comprehensive production leap forward in 1959, it is also wrong to only grasp the main and central aspects and ignore the work arrangements in other aspects. But this is another aspect of the problem, so I won't talk about it here.

    抓好帅印
    中共湖北黄坡塔耳岗区委员会　徐世苗
    党指示我们：当前农村工作中要以肥料挂帅。这是完全符合当前农村工作的实际状况的。农村党委的书记，目前就在抓肥料。
    书记挂帅，大搞群众运动的正确方针，在去年的大跃进里更加明确了。广大群众认识到：任何事脱离了党的领导都会一事无成。因而自觉的紧靠党的领导，要求书记挂帅，解决好工作中的具体问题，加快社会主义建设速度这是必然的。肯定地说，书记挂帅、全党动手、加强党的领导，是完成一切革命任务的根本保证。
    但是，在当前农村党的基层组织里，也产生了另外一种情况，这就是一些工作部门下到农村工作的少数干部，他们自己不多用脑子，不深入具体工作，一切细小问题的解决，都要“书记挂帅”。不分时间地点，任务轻重缓急，围着书记逼着要“元帅作主”。他们硬要把一些自己应该担当起来的事情和可以往后推的任务，强压在书记一个人头上，马上要办，还要书记亲自动手，好像只有这样才是书记挂了帅。这样就使一些书记弄得喘不过气来。有一位支部书记说：“工作乱如麻，帅印不好挂，成天到处跑，东抓又西抓。”春光社一个生产队的党支部书记陈国平说：“这也要我挂帅，那也要我挂帅，学校修房子没有石头，托儿所没有皮球玩，牛医收药费，饲养员要宰猪都跑来要我挂帅，亲自动手，我哪里挂得了这许多帅印呢？”
    这种情况，使书记陷入事务圈子，看不清问题的本质，抓不住运动的主流，反而影响了重要问题的解决。这样，并不是加强党的统一领导，而是分散党的领导精力，削弱了党的领导，不利于群众积极性的发挥，不利于干部在实际锻炼中增长自己的才干。
    要搞好书记挂帅，就要先看清楚“挂帅”的两个方面：一是书记亲自动手，坐下来钻进去，具体分析情况，同群众一道解决问题，不断的总结工作，推广经验。二是书记要善于根据客观形势的发展，捉住主要矛盾，抓住中心，作好党的政治思想工作，加强党对各项工作的领导，统率各个方面的大军，做到统一领导，全面安排，分工负责。这就是一方面书记要出马上阵，投入战斗指挥战斗，参加生产领导生产；另一方面必须摆脱日常琐细事务，跳出事务圈子，直接抓好思想、生产、生活。当前，书记就要把肥料工作抓起来。抓住了这个中心，才好带动其他工作。
    自然，实现1959年更大的更全面的生产大跃进，如果只抓住主要的中心的方面，而忽视其他方面的工作安排，也是不对的。但这是另一方面的问题，这里就不多谈了。
