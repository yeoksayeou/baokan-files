Xinhua News Agency, February 5th. Since the beginning of the new year, many regions have successively transferred a large number of cadres to the grassroots level. Some are taking turns going down to work as workers and farmers, while others are participating in physical labor and participating in grassroots leadership work.

Taking various forms of rotating cadres to participate in labor training has become a system in various places. The practice in 1958 proved that sending cadres down for labor training is of great significance for strengthening the relationship between leaders and the masses and promoting the high tide of the Great Leap Forward. This year, in conjunction with the rectification of communes, Party committees at all levels have drawn a large number of cadres to continue to rotate down to the grassroots level. Shandong Province has sent down a large number of cadres, with more than 24,000 cadres throughout the province being transferred for short-term participation in labor and assisting in commune rectification. Zhejiang Province has also sent down more than 10,000 cadres for labor and assisting in commune rectification. Among the more than 5,000 cadres recently sent down by leading organs at all levels in Hunan Province, there are more than 350 responsible cadres such as members of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee, vice governors, secretaries of the prefectural Party Committee, and secretaries of the county Party Committee. These cadres are prepared to establish base points at the grassroots level layer by layer, using points to drive the whole area, comprehensively rectify and consolidate the people's communes, and help various places quickly set off a new and greater production upsurge. Gansu Province has transferred a large number of cadres with leadership ability and experience to the people's communes to take on leadership work. According to statistics from four special districts and autonomous prefectures, including Tianshui, Zhangye, Dingxi, and Linxia, more than 5,600 people have been sent down so far. Yixing County, Jiangsu Province, recently transferred 321 agency cadres to the countryside. In addition to assisting commune and team cadres in carrying out the fertilizer accumulation campaign through participation in labor, they also helped communes and teams further improve labor organization, improve the production responsibility system, and arrange the lives of commune members. They were warmly welcomed by the masses in the communes.

This year, cadres in various places have taken various forms of going down. Some take turns going down to participate in physical labor, stipulating that the working time should not be less than one month; some are sent down to enrich the leadership at the grassroots level and conduct six months to one year of grassroots work training. Hunan Province stipulates that the time for sending down is generally from now until the end of the autumn harvest. The Boing County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Shandong Province decided that the 16 members of the County Party Committee Standing Committee and the County Mayor and Deputy County Mayor would be divided into four groups, taking turns to work as commune members in the production teams of the people's communes, with each person working as a commune member for no less than 50 days a year. At the same time, it is stipulated that leading cadres of party and government organs and enterprises and commercial departments at all levels in the county, except for a few elderly and sick people, should be sent down to the people's communes in batches to work as commune members.

After a large number of cadres were sent down to the people's communes, they strengthened the leadership of the communes and further inspired the labor enthusiasm of the masses. The eight people's communes in Wushan County, Gansu Province, are now equipped with six to seven Party committee secretaries and three to four presidents. Among the first secretaries of the eight commune Party committees, six are the original county Party secretaries or county heads. In Hunan Province, six communes are now led by members of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee and members of the Provincial Party Committee as the first secretaries of the Party Committee, and another 30 communes are led by secretaries of the prefectural Party Committee, members of the prefectural Party Committee, and deputy ministers of the prefectural Party Committee.

Because these cadres who were sent down to the communes ate, lived, and worked with the commune members, they were warmly supported by the vast number of commune members, and the commune members' enthusiasm for production was even higher. After the cadres were sent down to Yixing County, Jiangsu Province, they quickly promoted a winter production upsurge centered on fertilizer accumulation and topdressing of 100,000 people in the county, which greatly increased the amount of fertilizer accumulated in the county.

The cadres sent down to Baquan Commune in Zhoushan County, Zhejiang Province, participated in labor and helped the commune find ways to diversify its operations and organize professional teams. From January 1st to 21st, the commune's income from diversified operations reached more than 84,000 yuan, an increase of 58% over the previous month. The commune members praised them as good cadres sent by Chairman Mao.

    深入下去，推动今年更大更好更全面的跃进！
    大批干部继续下放锻炼
    新华社5日讯　新的一年开始以后，许多地区陆续抽调了大批干部下放到基层，有的轮流下去当工人、农民，有的一面参加体力劳动，一面参加基层的领导工作。
    采取各种方式轮流下放干部进行劳动锻炼，在各地已经成为一种制度。1958年实践证明，干部下放劳动锻炼对密切领导和群众的关系，推动大跃进的高潮，有着重大的意义。今年各级党委结合整社，又从领导机关中抽出大批干部继续轮流下放到基层。山东省下放的规模很大，全省已抽调二万四千多名干部短期下放参加劳动和帮助整社。浙江省下放劳动和帮助整社的干部也有一万多名。湖南省各级领导机关最近下放的五千多名干部中，有省委常委、副省长、地委书记、县委书记等负责干部三百五十多名。这些干部准备到基层去层层建立基点，以点带面，全面整顿和巩固人民公社，帮助各地迅速掀起新的更大的生产热潮。甘肃省抽调了大批有领导能力和经验的干部下放到人民公社去担任领导工作。据天水、张掖、定西、临夏等四个专区和自治州的统计，目前已经下放了五千六百多名。江苏省宜兴县最近抽调了三百二十一名机关干部下乡，他们除了通过参加劳动协助社、队干部开展积肥运动以外，还帮助社、队进一步改善劳动组织，健全生产责任制，安排社员生活，他们在公社里得到了群众的热烈欢迎。
    今年各地干部下放采取了各种形式。有的轮流下放参加体力劳动，规定劳动的时间不少于一个月；有的下放充实基层的领导，进行半年到一年的基层工作锻炼。湖南省规定下放的时间，一般从现在起一直到秋收结束。中共山东省博兴县委决定县委的常委和正副县长十六人，分成四批，轮流到人民公社的生产队去当社员，每人每年当社员的时间不少于五十天；同时规定全县各级党政机关及企业、商业部门的领导干部，除了个别年老和有病的以外，都分批轮流下放到人民公社当社员。
    大批干部下放到人民公社后，加强了公社的领导力量，进一步鼓舞了群众的劳动热情。甘肃武山县的八个人民公社，目前都配备了党委书记六至七名，社长三至四名，在八个公社党委第一书记中，有六个是原来的县委书记或县长。湖南省现在有六个公社分别由省委常务委员、省委委员一级干部担任党委第一书记，另有三十个公社分别由地委书记、地委委员和地委各部副部长一级干部担任领导工作。
    由于这些下放干部到公社后都做到了和社员同吃同住同劳动，受到了广大社员的热烈拥护，社员们的生产热情更为高涨。江苏省宜兴县下放干部以后，很快推动起全县十万人的以积肥追肥为中心的冬季生产高潮，使全县积肥的数量大量增加。
    浙江省舟山县下放到白泉公社的干部，一面参加劳动，一面帮助公社寻找多种经营门路，组织专业队，从1月1日到21日，全社多种经营的收入达到了八万四千多元，比上月增加了58％。社员们都称赞他们是毛主席派来的好干部。
