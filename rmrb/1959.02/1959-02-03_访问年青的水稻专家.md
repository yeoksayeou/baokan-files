    Visiting a Young Rice Expert
    Ouyang Shan
    I, along with Comrade Zhou Changshui, Secretary of the Daze District Committee of Xinhui County, went to visit rice expert Comrade Zhou Hanhua. Comrade Zhou Changshui is a little over twenty years old, and Comrade Zhou Hanhua is also a little over twenty years old, and it seems neither of them is married yet. They didn't mind that I was old or that I was an amateur. We had a very cordial and happy afternoon together.
    Comrade Zhou Hanhua is very good at using popular language to vividly explain some complex technical problems, making it fascinating for people who know nothing about that field of study. He can hybridize the paternal or maternal parent of rice with sorghum, with corn, with barnyard grass, with foxtail grass, and with various annual or perennial herbaceous plants, growing grains several times, even more than ten times, larger than the original rice varieties. Currently, there are probably dozens of such hybrid new varieties that have been successfully tested in the first generation, and there are many more that are being tested and have not yet yielded results. He described the characteristics of those researched and selected plants very specifically and accurately, telling us one by one about their pollination conditions, seasons, and times, the influence of wind and sun, and so on. He also demonstrated the detailed process of artificial pollination to us, how to kill some male pollen, how to collect other male pollen, how to pollinate, etc., performing it as if he could teach us on the spot. He wasn't like a military theorist lecturing on how to attack and retreat, but like a general narrating the course of a battle, which I listened to with fascination. Obviously, if this young general, covered in mud, barefoot, and with short hair, wins the battle, there will inevitably be a great revolution in rice production.
    Later, we braved the light rain to see his battlefield. That experimental field was less than one mu in size, planted with dozens of different kinds of rice, tall and short. Although those tall ones hadn't yet flowered and pollinated, they had already grown taller than my shoulders, and seemed more like sorghum than rice. Comrade Zhou Hanhua stretched out his already prominent chin and smiled, like a nanny standing behind a group of healthy children. He told us that this was only the second generation. Whether they will change, and what the laws of change are, will require several generations of experiments to confirm. Comrade Zhou Changshui also said that once it is confirmed, it can be promoted on a large scale. Then, Zhou Hanhua talked about how some foreign experts looked down on him, and how our Party supported him and encouraged his fighting spirit. Later, he jokingly talked about the embarrassing situation when he first started experimenting, with no electric lights, no watches, no thermos bottles, and no assistants. Now, Premier Zhou Enlai has given him an air battery lamp, Comrade Zhou Changshui has given him a watch, the commune has prepared a thermos bottle and an assistant for him, and the county party committee often cares for him, encourages him, educates him, and improves him.
    What moved me deeply was his simple and strong character, his style as an ordinary person engaged in great creative labor. He works without regard to remuneration, conditions, or honor, as long as he is not arrogant and as long as he listens to the Party. After several years of effort, I think he will succeed and bring happiness to our country and people. I also think that he is a person who can grasp the laws of rice development. He not only knows the present of rice, but also knows the future of rice. The rice he sees is different from the rice we see. If our writers can also grasp the laws of development of a person and a thing, then we can see the big from the small, know the future from the present, see the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 from the first Party Congress in 1921, and see an old scientist with gray hair from the current Zhou Hanhua. Then, although what is written is still the present, it must be deeper and truer than what is written by those who only know the present.

    访问年青的水稻专家
    欧阳山
    我和新会县大泽区区委书记周昌水同志一道，去访问水稻专家周汉华同志。周昌水同志是二十岁多一点的人，周汉华同志也是二十岁多一点的人，而且好像都还没有结婚。他们既不嫌我年纪大，又不嫌我外行，大家很亲切，很高兴地过了一个下午。
    周汉华同志很会使用通俗的语言生动地讲解一些复杂的技术问题，使对于那一门学问一无所知的人听起来津津有味。他能使水稻的父本或者母本和高粱杂交，和玉米杂交，和稗子杂交，和狗尾草杂交，和各种一年生的或多年生的草本植物杂交，长出比原来的水稻品种多几倍、甚至十几倍的谷子来。现在这种杂交新品种已经第一代试验成功的，大概有几十种，正在试验，还没得到结果的，又有许多种。他把那些经过研究、选择的植物的特点说得很具体、确切，它们授粉的情形、季节和时间，风和太阳的影响等等，都逐一告诉我们。他又把人工授粉的详细经过表演给我们看，怎样杀死一些雄粉，怎样采集另外一些雄粉，怎样授法等等，都表演一番，好像他当堂就能把我们教会似的。他不像一个军事理论家在讲授如何进攻和退却，却像一位将军在讲述一个战役的经过，使我听得都入了迷。很显然，如果这位满身泥土，打赤脚，短头发的年轻将军打了胜仗，那在水稻生产方面，必然会出现一次伟大的革命。
    后来，我们又冒着小雨去看他的战场。那一块实验田还不到一亩大，上面种着各种各样、高高矮矮的水稻好几十种。那些高大的虽然还没抽穗扬花，却已经长得高过我的肩膀，并且看来与其说是水稻，还不如说更像高粱。周汉华同志伸出他那本来已经突出的下巴笑了，好像一个保姆站在一群健康的孩子后面的笑容一样。他告诉我们，这才是第二代。它们究竟会不会发生变化，变化的规律又是怎么样，都要经过好几代的实验才能肯定下来。周昌水同志也说，一旦肯定下来之后，就可以大量推广。跟着，周汉华又谈起有些洋专家怎样瞧不起他，谈起咱们的党怎样支持他，怎样鼓舞他的斗志。后来，又当做笑话谈起当初做实验时，没有电灯，没有手表，没有热水瓶，没有助手的窘态来。现在，周恩来总理送了他一个空气电池灯，周昌水同志送了他一个手表，社里给他准备了热水瓶和助手，县委经常关心他，鼓励他，教育他，提高他。
    使我深深感动的，是他那淳朴坚强的性格，是他那做为一个普通群众在从事伟大的创造性劳动的风格。他不计报酬，不论条件，不问荣辱地在工作，只要他不骄傲，只要他听党的话，经过若干年的努力，我想他是会成功的，会给咱们的国家和人民带来幸福的。我又想，他是一个能够掌握水稻发展规律的人，他不仅知道水稻的今天，也知道水稻的明天，他所看见的水稻和我们所看见的水稻是不一样的。如果我们作家也能够掌握一个人和一件事的发展规律，那么就能见小知大，见今天知明天，从1921年的第一次党代表大会看出1949年的中华人民共和国成立，从现在的周汉华看出一个须发斑白的老科学家，那么，虽然所写的还是现在，一定要比仅仅知道现在的人所写的深刻得多，也真实得多。
