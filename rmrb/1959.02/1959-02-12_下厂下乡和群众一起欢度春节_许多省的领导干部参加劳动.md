　　Going Down to Factories and the Countryside to Celebrate the Spring Festival with the Masses
　　Leaders and Cadres of Many Provinces Participate in Labor

　　This newspaper, Kunming Dispatch: On the 9th, responsible comrades from the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and various departments of the Provincial People's Committee participated in voluntary labor at the Kunming Iron and Steel Plant, celebrating the Spring Festival together with workers and cadres.

　　When Xie Fuzhi, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, Secretary Ma Jikong, Vice Governor Liu Piyun, and more than seventy responsible comrades arrived at the Kunming Iron and Steel Plant, blast furnaces number one and two were emitting plumes of thick smoke, and the blowers roared deafeningly, as molten iron flowed from the furnace openings. As the Spring Festival began, more than eight hundred government cadres came to the Kunming Iron and Steel Plant to participate in labor, replacing all the workers who could be spared so they could take a holiday. On the 9th, after the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee arrived at the steel plant, they all took up baskets and carrying poles, went to the side of blast furnace number two, rolled up their sleeves, and worked alongside everyone. Encouraged by the participation of the responsible comrades in labor, the enthusiasm of the workers grew even greater. In the past two days, they have respectively created three high-production records in blast furnace ironmaking, converter steelmaking, and electric furnace steelmaking.

　　This newspaper, Zhengzhou, 11th: The suburbs of Zhengzhou are a green expanse of wheat.

　　The third day of the Lunar New Year was the last day of the Spring Festival holiday for the commune members in the suburbs, but here, a vast army of labor was busily accumulating fertilizer. Wu Zhipu, First Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Secretaries of the Secretariat Shi Xiangsheng and Li Li, Vice Governor Zhang Baiyuan, and many other cadres from provincial government organs, led the way, carrying iron shovels to work alongside the masses in accumulating fertilizer.

　　Comrade Wu Zhipu carried a manure basket to accumulate fertilizer, and whenever he had a free moment, he chatted with the commune members about their families and wheat field management. Many commune members praised Shi Xiangsheng as a farming expert. He didn't feel satisfied just carrying a manure basket, so he took off his coat, drove a manure cart, and, waving the whip and pulling the harness, was just like an ordinary, capable commune member.

　　It was past twelve noon, and there were still tens of thousands of catties of soil fertilizer that had not been carried away. The commune members insisted that the secretaries take a rest, but Shi Xiangsheng waved his iron shovel and said: "Let's do it! Completely eliminate it all."

　　On this day, in Guanhu Village, where the leading comrades of the Provincial Party Committee participated in labor, the labor attendance rate reached 100%, and more than one million catties of fertilizer were accumulated in one morning, applying topdressing fertilizer to more than sixty mu of wheat.

　　On the 9th, the people of Nanchang City, dressed in festive attire, held a 150,000-person joint celebration meeting in the newly built "August 1st" Park, with the theme "Celebrating the Good Harvest and Welcoming the Great Leap Forward." Shao Shiping, Liu Junxiu, and Bai Dongcai, Secretaries of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, danced the yangge and performed dragon lantern dances with workers, peasants, and students, celebrating the festival together. On the 10th, a delegation of more than 1,800 model workers and advanced workers from various factories and enterprises in Nanchang City went to various people's communes in Xinjian and Nanchang counties to visit their farmer brothers, warmly celebrating with them.

　　During the Spring Festival, many party and government leaders in various regions personally delivered fertilizer to the countryside to celebrate the festival with the commune members. On the morning of the 8th, Wang Jingmin, First Secretary of the Fuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Secretary Li Ziliang led more than 300 cadres from prefectural and special district organs to push fertilizer to the Xiaoqiao Commune in Linchuan County, congratulating the commune members on the Spring Festival.

    下厂下乡和群众一起欢度春节
    许多省的领导干部参加劳动
    本报昆明电　中共云南省委员会和省人民委员会各部门负责同志9日在昆明钢铁厂参加义务劳动，和工人、干部们一起欢度春节。
    当省委第一书记谢富治、书记马继孔、副省长刘披云和七十多位负责同志来到昆明钢铁厂时，一号、二号高炉正吐出缕缕浓烟，鼓风机发出震耳的轰鸣声，铁水从炉口滚滚奔流而出。春节开始时，有八百多个机关干部来昆明钢铁厂参加劳动，把凡是能替换的工人都替换下来休假。9日这天，省委负责同志到了钢铁厂后，都拿着箩筐和扁担，来到二号高炉旁边，挽起袖子和大家一道干起来。在负责同志参加劳动的鼓舞下，职工们干劲越来越大，这两天，他们已经分别创造了高炉炼铁、转炉和电炉炼钢等三项高产纪录。
    本报郑州11日电　郑州郊区一片麦绿。
    旧历初三是郊区社员春节的最后一天假日，可是这里却飞腾着积肥的劳动大军。中共河南省委第一书记吴芝圃，书记处书记史向生、李立，副省长张柏园等带领省直机关的许多干部，扛着铁锨来到这里和群众一块劳动积肥。
    吴芝圃同志抬着粪筐积肥，有点闲空就和社员聊聊家常和麦田管理。许多社员都称赞史向生是庄稼内行，他抬粪筐感到不过瘾，就脱下外衣赶粪车，挥着鞭子拉着套绳和一个普遍的能干社员一样。
    中午十二点多了，还有几万斤土肥没有抬完，社员们一定要书记们休息，史向生挥着铁锨说：干吧！彻底消灭光。
    这天省委领导同志参加劳动的这个关虎屯，劳动出勤率达到100％，一个上午就积肥一百多万斤，给六十多亩小麦上了追肥。
