Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 30th—Shanxi Province is massively accelerating the construction of mining, coking, refractory materials, and blast furnaces to ensure a greater leap forward for the steel marshal this year.

　　In terms of mine construction, fifteen small and medium-sized mining bases are currently under construction in areas such as Wutai, Tajishan, Yuanlan County, and Pingshun. The province's planned ore extraction this year will not only meet the needs of small and medium-sized steel plants in the Yangquan and Changzhi areas, but also ensure that most of the ore needed by the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company will also be supplied from within the province.

　　In terms of coke, in addition to a batch of Western-style coke ovens being actively built in Datong, Taiyuan, Gu County, and other places, Yangquan and other places are also mobilizing the masses to vigorously use indigenous methods for coking.

　　In addition, near these ore and coke bases, many refractory material factories have also been built, and it is expected that 100,000 tons of refractory materials can be produced in the first quarter of this year.

　　This year, while vigorously improving the production level of existing indigenous blast furnaces, nearly a hundred Western-style blast furnaces are also being newly built in various steel bases. Among these blast furnaces, in addition to the 1,053 cubic meter blast furnace of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company and several medium-sized blast furnaces of 250 cubic meters, most are small blast furnaces of about 30 cubic meters. These newly built large, medium, and small blast furnaces will be put into production around the second quarter of this year.

　　In order to refine good iron in blast furnaces, the metallurgical departments have also begun to build a batch of ore dressing plants and ore sintering plants in the ore bases of Wutai, Yuanlan County, Pingshun, and other counties to improve the ore grade. The Shanxi Coal Industry Department is also stepping up the construction of the Taiyuan and Jiexiu washing plants, and is preparing to build two more large-scale washing plants and a batch of simple washing plants to ensure that the steel marshal is provided with sufficient washed coal that meets the quality standards. In addition, the province has currently built 156 testing stations, and the workers in the vast majority of "small indigenous groups" steel bases can determine the ore grade and identify the ore composition themselves.

    火速壮大采矿炼焦力量
    十五个采矿基地加速建设　洋焦炉和土法炼焦同时发展
    新华社太原30日电　山西省正在大规模地加快采矿、炼焦、耐火材料和高炉方面的建设，以保证钢铁元帅在今年有更大的跃进。
    在矿山建设方面，目前正在五台、塔几山和原岚县、平顺等地建设十五个中小型采矿基地。今年全省计划开采的矿石量不仅能满足阳泉、长治地区的中小型钢铁厂的需要，还能使太原钢铁公司所需要的矿石也将大部分由省内供应。
    在焦炭方面，目前除了大同、太原、故县等地正在积极建设一批洋焦炉以外，阳泉等地还发动群众大力用土法炼焦。
    此外，在这些矿石、焦炭基地附近，还建设了许多耐火材料工厂，预计今年第一季度就能生产十万吨耐火材料。
    今年各个钢铁基地上在大力提高现有土高炉生产水平的同时，还在新建近百座洋高炉。这批高炉中，除太原钢铁公司的一千零五十三立方公尺和几个二百五十立方公尺的大中型高炉以外，绝大部分是三十立方公尺左右的小高炉。新建的这些大中小型高炉都将在今年第二季度前后投入生产。
    为了使高炉炼成好铁，冶金部门还在五台和原岚县、平顺等县的矿石基地上开始建设一批选矿厂和矿石烧结厂，以提高矿石品位；山西煤炭工业厅也在加紧建设太原、介休洗选厂，并且准备再兴建两座大型洗选厂和一批简易洗选厂，保证给钢铁元帅提供足够的、合乎质量标准的洗煤。此外，全省目前还建设起一百五十六个化验站，绝大多数“小土群”钢铁基地的职工都能自己定矿石品位，识别矿石成分。（附图片）
