Sincere Cooperation, Lasting Friendship
Li Qiang, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China

We celebrate the ninth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance with great excitement. Nine years ago, Chairman Mao said: "People can see that the unity of the people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, which has been fixed by the treaty, will be permanent, indestructible, and no one can separate it. And this unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of China and the Soviet Union, but also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of world peace and justice." Nine years of history have fully proved the great significance of the Sino-Soviet alliance.

1958 has passed, and it was an extraordinary year. The socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, is advancing by leaps and bounds in all aspects. The Soviet Union's steel production is about 55 million tons, and its production of coal and wheat far exceeds that of the United States, ranking first in the world. China's steel production has more than doubled, coal production has exceeded that of the United Kingdom, and average grain production has reached about 600 kilograms per person, while cotton production has exceeded that of the United States. The CPSU Central Committee's announcement of the 1959-1965 Soviet National Economic Development Plan and the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee's announcement of the guidelines and some major indicators for China's 1959 national economic construction will surely bring more brilliant achievements to the Soviet Union's communist construction and China's socialist construction.

1958 was indeed a difficult year for imperialism. The economic crisis in the United States is spreading to the entire capitalist world, and the contradictions between imperialists are expanding. The national independence movements of the colonial and semi-colonial peoples are rising unprecedentedly, Africa is awakening, and the torch of national independence has been ignited in the "backyard" of the United States - Latin America. The U.S. imperialist aggression against the people of the Middle East and its aggressive policy of creating tension in the Taiwan Strait, which undermines world peace, has been shamefully defeated by the unanimous opposition of peace-loving people all over the world.

The Chinese people are very grateful to the Soviet people for their fraternal support in the struggle of the Chinese people to consolidate the security of their motherland and safeguard their sovereignty and territorial integrity. Just as U.S. imperialism was expanding its aggression in the Taiwan Strait area of our country, Comrade Khrushchev resolutely warned U.S. imperialism: "An infringement on the People's Republic of China is an infringement on the Soviet Union." The Chinese people will never forget this close-as-brothers friendship of the Soviet people. Countless facts have proved that the great Sino-Soviet alliance and unbreakable unity have an increasingly profound impact and role on world peace and human progress. This great alliance has become an important pillar of world peace and human progress.

In the days when the east wind is blowing stronger and stronger, our trade and scientific and technological cooperation with the Soviet Union have also made great progress. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Commerce and Navigation signed in April 1958 fixed the economic and trade relations between China and the Soviet Union, which have been vigorously developing on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, mutual assistance and cooperation for the past eight years, in the form of a solemn treaty. It will greatly strengthen the unbreakable brotherly friendship between the people of the two countries, and vigorously promote the further consolidation and development of economic relations between the two countries, thereby benefiting the common high tide of the economies of China and the Soviet Union.

Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, Sino-Soviet trade has greatly developed in 1958. The proportion of trade with the Soviet Union in China's total foreign trade has increased from about 30% in 1950 to more than 40% in 1958. The fact that the trade volume between China and the Soviet Union has gradually developed reflects the planned and high-speed development of the economies of the two countries, and eloquently demonstrates the infinite superiority of the socialist system, which forms a sharp contrast with the imperialist camp where the crisis is continuing to develop.

In terms of imports, the Soviet Union supplies China with a large number of industrial equipment, ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, metal cutting machine tools, various power machines, agricultural machinery, instruments, locomotives, trucks, petroleum, pesticides, etc. In 1958, under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, China's demand for certain machinery, equipment and raw materials increased greatly. Therefore, after the signing of the Sino-Soviet Goods Exchange Agreement for 1958, we also made supplementary orders to the Soviet Union. The relevant departments of the Soviet Union met our needs in a fraternal spirit. For example, in order to support China's production leap forward, they supplemented us with a large number of industrial raw materials and heavy-duty vehicles when we were in great need, which was a very timely help for us to develop industrial and agricultural production, accelerate commodity circulation, and adjust market supply.

In 1958, the Soviet Union gave great assistance to China's industrial construction. According to the agreement signed between China and the Soviet Union during China's first five-year plan, the Soviet Union helped China build a total of 211 huge projects. In August 1958, China and the Soviet Union signed in Moscow an agreement on Soviet technical assistance in the construction and expansion of 47 industrial enterprises in China. The agreement stipulates that the Soviet Union will supply complete sets of equipment for enterprises in metallurgy, coal, petroleum, power stations, machinery manufacturing, building materials, etc. Some of these enterprises will be responsible for surveying, research and design work by the Soviet Union, and dispatch outstanding experts to China to provide technical assistance in installation, adjustment and production. The Soviet Union will also accept trainees from the above-mentioned enterprises to conduct production technology internships in relevant factories, mines and scientific research institutions in the Soviet Union.

Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, China's various industries have developed rapidly, and many equipment cannot be fully supplied domestically. The Soviet Union has also given great support and supplied China with many urgently needed equipment, such as small power stations, various machine tools, winches and electric shovels, etc., ensuring that some enterprises can be put into production on time. After the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise put forward the goal of completing the No. 1 blast furnace ahead of schedule before National Day, the Soviet Union supplied China with the first 70-ton weighing car that had just been produced, and sent experts to help install it, which played a great role in ensuring that the No. 1 blast furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel was put into production ahead of schedule. We are very grateful to the Soviet people for their great brotherly and selfless assistance to our country.

In terms of exports, we supply the Soviet Union with soybeans, rice, edible oils and fats, various non-ferrous metals and minerals, silk, tea, pig bristles, wool, various hides and leather products, frozen pork, frozen beef and mutton, frozen poultry, fruits, eggs, canned goods, hemp, flue-cured tobacco, various chemical raw materials, various light industrial products and handicrafts, etc. These materials are basically suitable for the needs of the Soviet Union, and they are also contributing to the Soviet Union's development of the national economy and meeting the needs of the Soviet people's ever-improving living standards.

Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement in 1954, the scientific and technological cooperation between China and the Soviet Union has developed extremely rapidly both in terms of the scale of cooperation and the form of cooperation. In 1958, under the situation of the overall leap forward in economy, science and culture in China and the Soviet Union, the scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries has developed even greater. In January 1958, China and the Soviet Union signed another extremely important Sino-Soviet protocol on jointly conducting and the Soviet Union assisting China in carrying out major scientific and technological research. According to the provisions of this protocol, the Soviet Union will help China realize the long-term plan for the development of science and technology from 1958 to 1962, and will jointly cooperate in studying 122 scientific and technological issues. The signing of this protocol has brought new development to Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation.

From 1954 to 1958, the Soviet Union supplied China with a lot of scientific and technological materials, and accepted many Chinese inspection experts to study in the Soviet Union, which played a great role in improving the technical level of various industrial sectors in our country. These advanced technical materials not only greatly shortened our design time and saved investment, but also enabled us to master many new technologies, thereby promoting our construction speed. The Soviet Union has also given us a lot of help in atomic energy and other cutting-edge sciences. As everyone knows, the first experimental atomic reactor and cyclotron that the Soviet Union helped China build have been completed and handed over to production before the National Day in 1958, which is an extremely valuable help for promoting the rapid development of China's atomic science and technology. Our country has also provided some construction experience and scientific and technological achievements to the Soviet Union. Such as the construction experience of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, technical data and process data for refining certain non-ferrous metals, research reports on the synthesis and utilization of reactive dyes, etc. Many medical departments in the Soviet Union have used acupuncture therapy to treat neuritis and bronchitis and other diseases, and have achieved relatively significant therapeutic effects. The seedlings and seeds supplied by China will also play a certain role in enriching Soviet crops. At the same time, extensive and direct contacts have also been established between the corresponding scientific and design institutions of China and the Soviet Union, which is playing a beneficial role in timely exchange of construction experience between China and the Soviet Union. According to the resolution of the eighth meeting of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee in January 1959, scientific and technological cooperation between China and the Soviet Union will be further expanded in 1959. The materials that the Soviet Union will supply to China include: production drawings for metallurgy, mining, beneficiation, drilling, geophysical surveying, chemical equipment, various machines and metal processing machine tools; technical design of a factory for extracting cobalt and nickel from converter slag and a hydrogen sulfide gas purification workshop; preliminary design of gas pipelines and coal washing plants; design of petroleum processing equipment and asbestos beneficiation plants; standard design of the textile workshop of a glass fiber factory; a series of important chemical product production processes, as well as works and scientific research reports on various issues. The materials that China supplies to the Soviet Union include: technical design of inland river passenger and cargo ships and ocean freighters; manufacturing drawings of various endless rope, internal combustion irrigation pumps and coal mine tunneling equipment; technical data on non-ferrous, precious and rare metal ore beneficiation tables, heat-resistant concrete panels for coke oven tops, and related industrial buildings; scientific research reports on beneficiation of some rare metal ores; design and research reports of several agricultural machinery; data on pharmaceutical production and scientific research, etc. In addition, China and the Soviet Union will also send experts to each other to inspect scientific and technological achievements and experience.

In order to further expand economic and technical cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Khrushchev signed in Moscow on February 7, 1959, an agreement on cooperation between the two sides in the construction of 78 large-scale industrial enterprises and power stations in metallurgy, chemical, coal, petroleum, machinery manufacturing, electrical machinery manufacturing, radio technology, and building materials in the People's Republic of China from 1959 to 1967. The agreement stipulates that the Soviet authorities will conduct research and design work based on the latest Soviet scientific and technological achievements, supply equipment, instruments and some special materials, dispatch the necessary number of Soviet experts to provide technical assistance in the construction, installation, adjustment and start-up production of enterprises, and accept Chinese experts and workers to the corresponding Soviet enterprises for production technology study. As China has made great achievements in developing the national economy, especially in developing the machinery manufacturing industry and training its own skilled engineering and technical personnel, China will independently create most of the supporting equipment required by the enterprises stipulated in the agreement, and will be responsible for the survey and design work of some of the above-mentioned enterprises. As in the past, the Soviet side will give the People's Republic of China the production license of the products manufactured by these enterprises free of charge, and provide the necessary technical data so that the People's Republic of China can organize the production and manufacture of the supporting equipment required by the enterprises stipulated in the agreement. This agreement will further expand economic and technical cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, help our country smoothly realize the great task of developing the national economy, and will further strengthen the unity and power of the countries in the socialist camp.

Such comprehensive and selfless brotherly cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union demonstrates a new type of international relations of equality, mutual benefit, friendship and cooperation based on the principles of proletarian internationalism. As Chairman Mao Zedong said, "Since there has been history, the relationship between any country cannot be as closely related as the socialist countries, so mutually respectful and mutually trusting, so mutually helpful and mutually encouraging." On the occasion of celebrating the great festival of the Sino-Soviet alliance, our people sincerely thank the Soviet people for their selfless assistance to our country, and will continue to earnestly learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and science and technology, exert all our efforts, speed up the pace of our country's construction, and more closely promote the friendly cooperation between our two countries in various fields, unite the vast peace-loving people of the world, and strive to oppose aggression, oppose war, safeguard world peace, and promote the cause of human progress.

Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!

    真诚的合作　永久的友谊
    中华人民共和国对外贸易部副部长　李强
    我们以十分激动的心情来庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订九周年纪念日。九年前，毛主席就曾经说过：“人们可以看得见：业已经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的团结将是永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。而这种团结，不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利”。九年的历史，完全证明了中苏友好同盟的这种伟大意义。
    1958年已经过去了，这是不平凡的一年。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营在各方面都在大踏步前进。苏联的钢产量约为五千五百万吨，苏联的煤和小麦的产量都远远超过美国而居于世界第一位。中国钢产量增长一倍以上，煤产量已经超过英国，粮食平均每人达到六百公斤左右，棉花产量已经超过了美国。而苏共中央公布1959年—1965年苏联发展国民经济计划，中共中央八届六中全会公布的1959年国民经济建设的方针和一些主要指标，必将使苏联的共产主义的建设和我国的社会主义建设事业取得更光辉的成就。
    1958年对帝国主义来说的确是不好过的。美国爆发的经济危机正在向整个资本主义世界蔓延，帝国主义之间的矛盾日益扩大。殖民地、半殖民地人民的民族独立运动空前高涨，非洲觉醒了，美国的“后院”——拉丁美洲燃起了民族独立的火炬。美帝国主义对中东人民的侵略和在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势，破坏世界和平的侵略政策在全世界爱好和平人民的一致反对下，已遭到了可耻的失败。
    中国人民十分感谢苏联人民在中国人民巩固自己祖国的安全、维护主权和领土完整的斗争中，所给予的兄弟般的支援。正当美帝国主义在我国台湾海峡地区扩大侵略的时候，赫鲁晓夫同志断然警告美国帝国主义：“对中华人民共和国的侵犯也就是对苏联的侵犯”，中国人民对苏联人民这种亲如手足的情谊是永远感念不忘的。无数事实证明，伟大的中苏同盟和牢不可破的团结，对世界和平和人类进步事业所起的影响和作用愈来愈深远。这个伟大同盟已经成为世界和平和人类进步的重要支柱。
    在东风吹得日益劲疾的日子里，我国同苏联的贸易往来和科学技术合作方面，也有了很大发展。1958年4月签订的中苏通商航海条约，把中苏两国八年来在平等互利、互助合作基础上蓬勃发展起来的经济贸易关系通过庄严的条约形式固定下来了。它将大大加强两国人民间的牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊，有力地促进两国经济关系进一步的巩固和发展，从而有利于中苏两国经济的共同高涨。
    在大跃进的形势下，1958年中苏贸易有了较大的发展，1958年对苏贸易额占我国对外贸易总额的比重已由1950年的30％左右，增至1958年的40％以上。中苏两国间贸易额逐步发展的事实，反映了两国经济有计划的高速度的发展，雄辩地说明了社会主义制度的无限优越性，它与危机正在继续发展的帝国主义阵营形成了一个鲜明的对比。
    在进口方面，苏联供应我国大量的工业设备、黑色金属、有色金属、金属切削机床、各种动力机器、农业机械、仪器、机车、卡车、石油、农药等。1958年我国在大跃进形势下，对于某些机器设备和原材料需要量大大增加，因此在中苏两国1958年货物交换议定书签订以后，还向苏联提出了补充订货，苏联各有关部门都以兄弟般的精神，满足了我们的需要，例如，为了支援我国生产大跃进，在我们十分需要的时候，补充供应我们大量的工业原料和载重汽车，这对我们发展工农业生产，加速商品流转，调剂市场供应是十分及时的帮助。
    1958年苏联对我国工业建设方面给予很大的帮助。根据我国第一个五年计划期间中苏两国签订的协定，苏联帮助我国建设的巨大工程共有二百一十一项。1958年8月中苏两国在莫斯科又签订了关于苏联在对我国建设和扩建四十七项工业企业的技术援助协定。协定规定苏联将供应我国冶金、煤炭、石油、电站、机械制造、建筑材料等企业的成套设备。其中部分企业将由苏联负责勘测、研究和设计工作，派遣优秀专家来华在安装，调整和开工生产方面给以技术援助。苏联还将接受上述企业的实习生在苏联有关的厂矿和科学研究机构中进行生产技术实习。
    1958年大跃进以来，我国各种工业突飞猛进地发展起来，很多设备国内还不能充分供应，苏联也给了大力支持，供给了我国急需的很多设备。如小型电站、各种机床、绞车和电铲等等。保证了一些企业能按时投入生产。在提出武汉钢铁联合企业第一号高炉提前在国庆节前完成的指标以后，苏联把刚刚生产出来的第一台七十吨的称量车供给我国，并派专家帮助安装，对保证武钢一号高炉提前投入生产起了很大作用。我们十分感谢苏联人民对我国伟大的兄弟般的无私援助。
    在出口方面，我们供应苏联大豆、大米、食用油脂油料、各种有色金属和矿产品、丝绸、茶叶、猪鬃、羊毛、各种皮张和皮革制品、冻猪肉、冻牛羊肉、冻家禽、水果、蛋品、罐头、麻、烤烟、各种化工原料、各种轻工业品和手工艺品等。这些物资基本上是适合苏联需要的，对于苏联发展国民经济、满足苏联人民生活日益提高的需要，也是有所贡献的。
    中苏两国的科学技术合作，自从1954年签订中苏科学技术合作协定以来，无论在合作的规模和合作的形式上都有了极其迅速的发展。1958年在中苏两国经济、科学、文化全面跃进的形势下，两国间的科学技术合作有了更大的发展。中苏两国在1958年1月又签订了一个极其重要的中苏关于共同进行和苏联帮助中国进行的重大科学技术研究的议定书。根据这个议定书的规定，苏联将帮助中国实现1958年到1962年的发展科学技术的远景规划，并将共同合作研究一百二十二项科学技术问题。这个议定书的签订使中苏科学技术合作有了新的发展。
    从1954年到1958年这个时期中，苏联供应我国很多科学技术资料，接受我国许多考察专家赴苏学习，对提高我国各工业部门的技术水平起了很大作用。这些先进的技术资料不仅使我们大大缩短设计时间，节省投资，并且使我们掌握了很多新的技术，从而促进了我们的建设速度。苏联还在原子能及其他尖端科学方面给了我们很多帮助。大家知道，苏联帮助我国建设的第一座实验性原子反应堆和回旋加速器，已经在1958年国庆节前夕建成并且移交生产，这对于促进我国原子科学技术的迅速发展是一项极其珍贵的帮助。我国也同样提供了一些建设经验和科学技术成就给苏联。如武汉长江大桥施工经验，提炼某些有色金属的技术资料和工艺资料，活性染料合成和利用的研究报告等。苏联已经有不少医疗部门用针灸疗法来医治神经炎和支气管炎等疾病，并已获得比较显著的疗效。而中国供应的苗木种子也将对丰富苏联农作物起一定作用。与此同时，中苏两国相应的科学机构和设计机构之间也建立了广泛的、直接的联系，对及时交流中苏两国的建设经验，起着有益的作用。根据中苏科学技术合作委员会第八届例会1959年1月的决议，1959年中苏两国之间的科学技术将有更大开展。苏联将供给中国的资料有：生产冶金、矿山、选矿、钻探、地球物理测量、化工设备、各种机器和金属加工机床的制造图纸；由转炉渣提取钴和镍的工厂、硫化氢气体净化车间的技术设计；煤气管道、洗煤厂的初步设计；石油加工设备和石棉选矿厂的设计；玻璃纤维厂的纺织车间的标准设计；一系列重要化学制品的生产工艺，以及各种问题的著作和科学研究报告等。中国方面供应苏联的资料有：内河客货轮和海洋干货轮的技术设计；各种无极绳，内燃灌溉水泵和煤矿掘进设备的制造图纸；有色、贵重、稀有金属矿的精选台、焦炉炉顶用耐热混凝土板和有关工业建筑的技术资料；提取某些稀有金属矿的选矿科学研究报告；若干农业机械的设计和研究报告；医药生产和科学研究的资料等。此外，中苏双方还将互派专家考察科学技术成就和经验。
    为了进一步扩大中苏两国间的经济和技术合作，中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来同志和苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志于1959年2月7日在莫斯科签订了一项关于双方进行合作在1959年到1967年间在中华人民共和国建设冶金、化学、煤炭、石油、机器制造、电机制造、无线电技术、建筑材料等七十八个大型工业企业和电站的协定。协定规定苏联机关根据苏联最新的科学技术成就进行研究和设计工作，供应设备、仪器和某些专用材料，派遣必要数量的苏联专家在企业的施工、安装、调整和开工生产方面给予技术援助，并且接受中国的专家和工人到苏联的相应企业进行生产技术学习。由于中国在发展国民经济、特别是发展机器制造业和培养本国熟练工程技术干部方面取得了巨大成就，中国方面将自行创造协定中规定的企业所需要的大部分配套设备，并且担负上述某些企业的勘察设计工作。同过去一样，苏联方面把规定由这些企业制造的产品的生产特许权无偿地给予中华人民共和国，并且提供必要的技术资料，以便中华人民共和国组织生产和制造协定中规定的企业所需要的配套设备。这个协定必将进一步扩大中苏两国间经济和技术合作，有助于我国顺利实现发展国民经济的宏伟任务，并将进一步加强社会主义阵营各国的团结和威力。
    中苏两国人民这样全面、无私的兄弟般的合作，显示了一种根据无产阶级国际主义原则建立起来的平等互利、友好合作的新型国际关系。正如毛泽东主席所说，“自从有历史以来，任何国家的关系，都不可能像社会主义国家间这样休戚与共，这样互相尊重和互相信任，这样互相援助和互相鼓舞”。在庆祝中苏友好同盟的伟大节日的时候，我国人民衷心地感谢苏联人民对我国的无私帮助，并将继续认真学习苏联的先进经验和科学技术，鼓足干劲，加快步伐进行我国的建设，并且更加密切我们两国在各方面的友好合作，团结全世界广大爱好和平的人民，为反对侵略、反对战争，维护世界和平，促进人类进步事业而奋斗。
    中苏两国人民永恒的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
