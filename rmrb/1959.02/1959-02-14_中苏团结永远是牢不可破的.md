    Today our people, with boundless excitement, warmly celebrate the ninth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. The great alliance between China and the Soviet Union, developed on the basis of this treaty, has had a profound and far-reaching impact on the course of historical development of our era. As early as when the treaty was signed, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "People can see that the unity of the people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, which has been fixed by the treaty, will be permanent, unbreakable, and no one can separate it. And this unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of China and the Soviet Union, but also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of peace and justice in the world." History has proved and will continue to prove the correctness of this thesis.
    China and the Soviet Union are two large countries closely adjacent to each other in the world. The heroic and hardworking people of our two countries, numbering more than 800 million, account for nearly one-third of the world's population. Our two countries have vast lands with infinitely rich resources. Following the common path opened up by the great October Socialist Revolution, the construction undertakings of China and the Soviet Union have achieved brilliant successes. The Soviet Union has been at the forefront of the world in terms of industrial development speed and absolute output increase, and in some of the most important departments of science and technology. It is now entering a new period of fully unfolding the construction of a communist society, and will surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of total industrial output and per capita output in seven to twelve years. After the victorious completion of the First Five-Year Plan, the Chinese people also realized a comprehensive great leap forward in socialist construction in 1958, and are now striving for a greater, better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959. The Chinese people are determined to build a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in fifteen years or more. The alliance of two such large countries as China and the Soviet Union cannot but have significant historical significance.
    The great principle of proletarian internationalism is the solid foundation of the unity and friendship between our two countries. Common interests and common ideals closely link our two countries together. In the past nine years, the mutual support and close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in international affairs and domestic construction, and the continuous development of the fraternal unity between China and the Soviet Union, have fully conformed to the greatest interests of our two peoples, and are the most important guarantee for the security and construction of our two countries, and also the most important guarantee for the consolidation and strengthening of the socialist camp.
    The friendly alliance and strong unity between China and the Soviet Union are the most reliable pillar in the struggle against aggression and in defense of world peace. When the People's Republic of China was established for less than a year, US imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea, and at the same time occupied China's territory Taiwan. The Chinese people sent their volunteers to fight alongside the Korean people, and with the strong support of the Soviet Union, smashed the US aggression plan and achieved peace in Korea. In 1954, China and the Soviet Union worked together to support the independence and peaceful aspirations of the people of Indochina, and promoted the conclusion of the Geneva Accords on restoring peace in Indochina. In 1956, imperialism stirred up a counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary, attempting to restore capitalism there. With the full support of China, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the Hungarian people smashed the subversive conspiracy of the Hungarian and foreign reactionaries. In the autumn of 1958, US imperialism carried out military provocations and war threats against our country in the Taiwan Straits area. With the strong support of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, and the solidarity of peace-loving countries and people around the world, our people shattered the aggression plan of US imperialism. People clearly see that in recent years, whenever imperialism launches a war of aggression against Asian and African countries and people, or carries out armed intervention, or carries out subversive activities, seriously threatening world peace, the Soviet Union and the Chinese people have always stood firmly on the side of the countries and peoples fighting for national independence, supporting them in their opposition to imperialist aggression and intervention. In this way, the imperialist war of aggression against Egypt, the conspiracy to subvert Syria, the activities of supporting the Indonesian rebel groups, and the series of aggressive actions of armed invasion of Lebanon and Jordan, attempting to strangle the Iraqi people's revolution, have all encountered strong resistance. With the support of China, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, peace-loving countries in Asia and Africa, and all peace-loving people around the world, the people of these countries have made the imperialist aggression plans shamefully fail.
    The complete agreement between China and the Soviet Union on strengthening the friendly, allied and mutual assistance relations between each other and on conducting a joint struggle for the peaceful settlement of international issues and the maintenance of world peace is fully expressed in the communique of the meeting between Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev held at the end of July and the beginning of August last year. The communique stated that China and the Soviet Union firmly support the national independence movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America; China and the Soviet Union will do everything possible to continue to work to ease the international situation and prevent new war disasters; China and the Soviet Union are determined to continue to develop comprehensive cooperation between the two countries, further strengthen the unity of the socialist camp, and further strengthen the unity with all peace-loving countries and people; The Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will spare no effort to defend the unity of the two Parties, defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, defend the principles of the Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries, and wage an uncompromising struggle against revisionism. All these are contrary to the wishes of the imperialists and revisionists. The imperialists and revisionists are most afraid of the close unity and common struggle of the two great allies of China and the Soviet Union, and they try every means to undermine this unity. The report of Comrade Khrushchev at the recently concluded 21st Congress of the CPSU, and the congratulatory message to the Congress signed by Comrade Mao Zedong and the speech of Comrade Zhou Enlai, gave a heavy blow to the despicable conspiracies of the imperialists and revisionists.
    Today, when celebrating the ninth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the Chinese people naturally think of the tremendous selfless assistance of the Soviet government and people to our country's construction undertakings. According to the agreement signed between China and the Soviet Union during the First Five-Year Plan period, the Soviet Union helped our country build 211 large projects. In August 1958, the two countries signed an agreement for the Soviet Union to help our country build and expand 47 industrial enterprises. All these enterprises are the backbone of our country's construction. In order to help our country build these enterprises, the Soviet Union has given us selfless assistance from collecting factory construction materials, surveying, selecting factory sites, designing, supplying equipment, guiding construction and installation and operation, training talents, supplying technical materials and drawings, all the way to producing new products. The construction and completion of these enterprises played a decisive role in laying the foundation for industrialization in our country during the First Five-Year Plan period, which not only greatly improved the productivity of our industry, enabling our country to produce many products that could not be produced in the past, but also helped our country train and cultivate a large number of technical talents. The Soviet Union's assistance to our country's economic construction, whether in terms of quantity or scale, is unprecedented in history. Our people have always believed that the Soviet Union's assistance is one of the important factors for our country's rapid progress. The communique of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of our Party pointed out: "The achievements of our country's economic construction are inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries."
    Recently, after friendly negotiations between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union, an agreement on expanding economic cooperation between the two countries was signed on February 7. The signing of this agreement is a further development of the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. According to the provisions of this agreement, during the period from 1959 to 1967, the Soviet Union will again help our country build 78 large-scale industrial enterprises and power stations in metallurgy, chemical industry, coal, petroleum, machinery manufacturing, electrical machinery manufacturing, radio technology, and building materials. The Soviet Union will conduct research and design work based on the latest scientific and technological achievements, supply equipment and instruments and certain special materials, and provide technical assistance in the construction, installation, adjustment and start-up production of the enterprises. The total value of equipment, materials and various technical assistance provided by the Soviet Union is about 5 billion rubles. The Chinese side will provide goods to the Soviet Union in accordance with the current trade agreement between China and the Soviet Union to pay for the equipment and various technical assistance provided by the Soviet Union. The new industrial enterprises that the Soviet Union is assisting our country to build are all key heavy industrial production departments in our country's construction. Among them are large-scale, technologically advanced iron and steel complexes with an annual output of millions of tons, thermal power plants that help our country rapidly increase power generation, huge open-pit coal mines, super-heavy machinery manufacturing plants, and so on. These 78 enterprises are all enterprises that are difficult to complete independently under our country's current technical conditions. The completion of these enterprises will further enhance the backbone strength of our country's modern industry, win time, and accelerate the realization of the grand task of developing our country's national economy.
    The Soviet Union's new assistance to our country's economic construction once again vividly demonstrates the lofty internationalist spirit of the Soviet people and their sincere friendship towards fraternal countries. As everyone knows, the recently held 21st Congress of the CPSU adopted the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy from 1959 to 1965. In order to realize this unprecedented great plan, the Soviet Union urgently needs to invest a large amount of funds, equipment and technical forces. The Soviet Union is bearing the burden of assisting our country under the circumstances that the domestic construction tasks are quite heavy. Moreover, Comrade Khrushchev also mentioned at the 21st Congress of the CPSU that the Soviet Union will continue to provide economic and technical assistance to all fraternal countries during the Seven-Year Plan period. The agreement on expanding economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union strongly shows that the Soviet Union cares about the economic development of all fraternal countries as much as it cares about its own, and continues to tirelessly work to promote the common upsurge of the economies of all countries in the socialist camp. The Chinese people express their heartfelt gratitude for this great selfless assistance from the Soviet Union.
    On the day when we warmly celebrate the ninth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, our people are striving to achieve a new great leap forward in 1959 on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958. We will continue to work hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, build socialism more, faster, better, and more economically, and further strengthen the friendly unity and mutual assistance and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. We Chinese people will always stand with the Soviet people, and fight to the end to strengthen the strength and unity of the world socialist system headed by the Soviet Union, and for world peace and the cause of socialism!

### 中苏团结永远是牢不可破的

    中苏团结永远是牢不可破的
    今天，我国人民怀着无限的兴奋，热烈庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订九周年纪念日。根据这个条约而发展起来的中苏两国的伟大同盟，对我们时代的历史发展的进程有着巨大的深远的影响。早在这个条约签订的当时，毛泽东同志就曾指出：“人们可以看得见：业已经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的团结将是永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。而这种团结，不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”历史已经证明并且还要继续证明这个论断的正确性。
    中苏两国是世界上两个紧相毗连的大国。我们两国的英勇勤劳的八亿以上的人民，占全世界人口近三分之一。我们两国的土地广阔，有着无限丰富的资源。沿着伟大的十月社会主义革命开辟的共同道路，中苏两国的建设事业获得了辉煌的成就。苏联已经在工业发展速度和绝对的增产量方面，在科学技术的一些最重要的部门方面，走在世界的最前列，现在正在进入全面展开建设共产主义社会的新时期，要在七年到十二年内在工业总产量和按人口平均的产量方面，超过最发达的资本主义国家。我国人民在胜利完成第一个五年计划以后，又在1958年实现了社会主义建设的全面大跃进，正在为1959年取得更大更好更全面的跃进奋斗。我国人民决心要在十五年或者更多一些的时间里，建成一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家。中苏这样两个大国的同盟就不能不具有重大的历史意义。
    伟大的无产阶级国际主义的原则是我们两国的团结和友谊的坚固的基础。共同的利益和共同的理想把我们两国紧紧地连结在一起。在过去九年中，中苏两国在国际事务和国内建设方面的相互支持和紧密合作，中苏两国的兄弟般的团结的不断发展，完全符合我们两国人民的最大利益，是我们两国的安全和建设的最重要的保证，也是社会主义阵营的巩固和加强的最重要的保证。
    中苏两国的友好同盟和坚强团结，是反对侵略、保卫世界和平的斗争的最可靠支柱。当中华人民共和国成立不到一年的时候，美帝国主义就发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，同时侵占了中国的领土台湾。中国人民派出自己的志愿军同朝鲜人民一起，在苏联的大力支持下，粉碎了美国的侵略计划，实现了朝鲜的和平。1954年，中苏两国又共同努力，支持印度支那人民的独立与和平的愿望，促成了恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦协定的缔结。1956年，帝国主义又煽起了匈牙利的反革命暴乱，妄想在那里复辟资本主义，匈牙利人民在中苏两国和其他社会主义国家的全力支持下，粉碎了匈牙利国内外反动派的颠覆阴谋。1958年秋，美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区对我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，我国人民在苏联和其他兄弟国家的有力支持以及各国爱好和平国家和人民的声援下打破了美帝国主义的侵略计划。人们清楚地看到，最近几年来，每当帝国主义对亚非国家和人民发动侵略战争，或者实行武装干涉，或者实行颠覆活动，使世界和平遭到严重威胁的时候，苏联和中国人民每一次都站在坚决为民族独立而斗争的国家和人民一边，支持他们反对帝国主义的侵略和干涉。这样，帝国主义侵略埃及的战争，颠覆叙利亚的阴谋，支持印度尼西亚叛乱集团的活动以及武装侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，妄想扼杀伊拉克人民革命的一连串侵略行动，都遭到了有力的反抗。这些国家的人民在中苏两国和其他社会主义国家、亚非爱好和平国家以及全世界所有爱好和平人民的支持下，使帝国主义侵略计划可耻地失败了。
    中苏两国在加强相互之间的友好、同盟、互助关系以及为争取和平解决国际问题、维护世界和平而进行共同斗争的问题上的完全一致，充分地表达在去年7月底、8月初举行的毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志会谈公报中。会谈公报声明，中苏两国坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民的民族独立运动；中苏两国将竭尽一切可能，继续为和缓国际局势、防止新战争灾难而努力；中苏两国决心继续发展两国全面的合作，进一步加强社会主义阵营的团结，进一步加强同一切爱好和平的国家和人民的团结；中国共产党和苏联共产党将不遗余力地捍卫两党的团结，捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁、捍卫各国共产党和工人党莫斯科宣言的原则，对修正主义进行毫不调和的斗争。所有这些，都是同帝国主义者和修正主义者的愿望背道而驰的。帝国主义者和修正主义者最害怕中苏两大盟国的亲密团结和共同斗争，他们千方百计地企图破坏这种团结。在几天前刚刚结束的苏共第二十一次代表大会上赫鲁晓夫同志的报告和毛泽东同志签署的给大会的贺词和周恩来同志的致词，对于帝国主义者和修正主义者的卑鄙阴谋，给了沉重的打击。
    今天，当庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订九周年的时候，我国人民自然而然地想到苏联政府和人民对我国建设事业的巨大的无私的援助。根据第一个五年计划期间中苏两国签订的协定，苏联帮助我国建设二百一十一项巨大工程。1958年8月，两国又签订了苏联帮助我国建设和扩建四十七项工业企业。所有这些企业，都是我国建设的骨干。为了帮助我国建设这些企业，苏联曾从搜集建厂资料、勘察、选择厂地、设计、供应设备、指导建筑安装和运转、训练人才、供应技术资料和图纸，一直到生产出新产品来，都给予我们以无私的帮助。这些企业的建设和建成，对于我国在第一个五年计划期间奠定工业化的基础，起了决定性的作用，不仅大大提高了我国工业的生产力，使我国能够生产许多过去不能生产的产品，而且还帮助我国训练和培养了大批技术人才。苏联对我国经济建设的援助，无论就其数量或规模来说，都是历史上空前的。我国人民一向认为，苏联的援助是我国取得迅速进展的重要因素之一。我们党的八届六中全会公报指出：“我国经济建设的成就，是同苏联和各兄弟国家的援助分不开的。”
    最近，中苏两国领导人经过友好的谈判，在2月7日签订了一项两国扩大经济合作协定。这个协定的签订，是中苏两国的友好合作的进一步发展。根据这个协定的规定，在1959年到1967年间，苏联将再帮助我国建设冶金、化学、煤炭、石油、机器制造、电机制造、无线电技术、建筑材料等七十八项大型工业企业和发电站。苏联将根据最新的科学技术成就进行研究和设计工作，供应设备仪器和某些专用材料，并在企业的施工、安装、调整和开工生产方面提供技术援助。由苏联供应的设备材料和各种技术援助的总值为五十亿卢布左右。中国方面将根据中苏现行贸易协定，向苏联提供商品，以偿付苏联供应的设备和各种技术援助。苏联援助我国建设的新的工业企业，都是对我国建设中关键性的重工业生产部门。其中有规模宏大、技术先进、年产量达到几百万吨能力的钢铁联合企业，有帮助我国迅速增加发电量的火力发电厂，有巨大的露天煤矿，有超重型的机器制造厂等等。这七十八项企业都是在我国目前技术条件下难于单独完成的企业。这些企业的建成，将进一步增强我国现代化工业的骨干力量，赢得时间，加速实现发展我国国民经济的宏伟任务。
    苏联对我国经济建设的新的援助，再一次生动地表现了苏联人民崇高的国际主义精神和对兄弟国家的真诚友谊。大家知道，最近举行的苏共第二十一次代表大会通过了苏联1959—1965年发展国民经济的七年计划。为了实现这个史无前例的伟大计划，苏联投入大量的资金、设备和技术力量的需要十分迫切。苏联就是在国内建设任务相当繁重的情况下负担对我国的援助的。而且，赫鲁晓夫同志在苏共第二十一次代表大会上还提到，苏联在七年计划期间还继续进行对所有兄弟国家的经济援助和技术援助。中苏两国扩大经济合作的协定，有力地表明了苏联像关心自己一样地关心各兄弟国家的经济发展，并继续不倦地致力于促进社会主义阵营各国经济的共同高涨。我国人民对于苏联的这一伟大无私的援助，表示衷心的感谢。
    在我们热烈庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订九周年的日子里，我国人民正在1958年大跃进的基础上，争取实现1959年新的大跃进。我们将继续努力学习苏联的先进经验，更多、更快、更好、更省地建设社会主义，进一步加强中苏两国的友好团结和互助合作。我们中国人民将永远同苏联人民一起，为加强以苏联为首的世界社会主义体系的力量和团结，为世界和平和社会主义事业而奋斗到底！
