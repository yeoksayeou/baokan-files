    The First Round
    By Our Correspondent Zhang Ming
    When the harsh winter arrived at Liujiaxia, the sheer cliffs on both sides of the Yellow River were still covered with people. The clanging of hammers, the laughter of people, and the melodious songs rose from the valley. Huge rocks, roaring, rolled into the Yellow River, and smoke and dust filled the riverbed. This is the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station construction site.
    Here, people are using their dragon-taming, tiger-subduing hands to cast the second rope to tame the Yellow River, following the Sanmenxia project.
    The people of Liujiaxia Village have been awed by the power of the Yellow River for generations. When more than 3,000 cubic meters per second of floodwaters roared out of the narrow gorge, only 40 to 50 meters wide, people felt the whole earth tremble. Who could subdue it? Who could have such power?
    The people who would subdue it finally came! On September 27, 1958, cheers of workers rang out over Liujiaxia Village. On this day, the first hammer of a steel drill struck the hard rock of Liujiaxia.
    At that time, there were few people on the construction site, and equipment and materials were insufficient, resulting in many difficulties. However, the workers said: "We are riding on native-made horses to catch up with mechanization, and we are not afraid of any difficulties!" The workers launched a fearless struggle against nature.
    On the day the construction started, the workers made a solemn oath: to capture three passes before the first dry season: to build the diversion tunnel, to dam the river, and to excavate the dam foundation. They were racing towards a glorious goal: to strive for power generation in 1960!
    In the severe cold, the construction site was still a scene of boiling activity. Red flags fluttered on the cliffs on the right bank of the Yellow River, and explosions were continuous. In order to carve out two roads on the cliffs and to embed the 140-meter-high main dam deep into the bank rocks, the brave men with safety belts tied around their waists were agilely peeling off the rock layers.
    The diversion tunnel on the left bank of the river is the first of the three passes this year. On New Year's Day, only a few dozen days after construction began, the upper pilot tunnel was broken through by the heroes. The tunnel is like a winding dragon, its head resting on the upstream bank of the river, and its tail hanging downstream. Soon, when the moment of damming arrives, it will open its mouth wide and swallow the rolling Yellow River!
    This diversion tunnel is fourteen meters in diameter, and including the five branch tunnels, trains can enter. According to the design, workers had to drill into the tunnel in several directions to remove 130,000 cubic meters of rock.
    The deeper they went into the tunnel, the more difficult their actions became. The air in the tunnel was thin, and after an explosion, the smoke would be blocked in the tunnel for a while. However, the heroes proposed to "seize time, not letting go of every second." Whenever the sound of an explosion fell, the slag removal team rushed up and quickly cleared the slag, opening the passage for the drillers. The Second Detachment first created a new record of 6.6 meters per day, followed by the Third Detachment with 8 meters, the First Detachment with 8.1 meters, 10.65 meters.... At one hour and thirty minutes on New Year's Day, shortly after the explosion team fired the last shot, someone shouted in surprise, "It's through!" The heroes waiting at both ends then swarmed up, drilled through the blasted opening, and warmly embraced and cheered each other. The first round was won!
    Serious battles are still ahead. The workload of the upper pilot tunnel is only one-tenth of the total workload, and there are only two months left. At this time, it is necessary to remove more than 130,000 cubic meters of rock from the cave and clear it out, and greater energy and wisdom must be paid. After passing the first pass, the damming pass must be fought, which will be an even more serious battle. All the combatants on the construction site are full of soaring energy. They will never let the first dry season pass easily, and they will use creative labor to welcome new victories! (Attached pictures)

    第一个回合
    本报记者  张鸣
    当严冬来到刘家峡的时候，黄河两岸如削的峭壁上仍旧布满了人群。锤子的叮当声，人们的欢笑声，悦耳的歌声，由山谷中升起。巨大的石块，带着吼声滚进黄河，烟尘弥漫了河槽。这就是刘家峡水电站工地。
    这里的人们，用擒龙伏虎的双手，紧接着三门峡工程，在黄河身上投下了驯服它的第二条绳索。
    刘家峡村的人们，世世代代慑服在黄河威力之下。当三千多秒公方的洪水，从四、五十公尺宽的峡谷咆哮而出的时候，人们顿觉整个大地都在颤动。谁能够制服它呢？谁能有这样的力量呢？
    制服它的人终于来了！1958年9月27日，刘家峡村上空响起了工人们的欢呼声。就在这一天，第一锤钢钎打进了刘家峡的坚硬的岩石。
    当时，工地上人很少，又加上设备不全，材料不足，困难相当多。可是，工人们说：“我们是踏上土法马，追赶机械化，什么困难都不怕！”工人们以大无畏的精神向大自然展开了斗争。
    开工的那天，工人们就发出了庄严的誓言：第一个枯水季节前攻取三道关：修通导流隧洞，截流和开挖大坝基坑。他们纵马追赶着一个辉煌的目标：争取1960年发电！
    严寒里，工地上还是一片沸腾。黄河右岸悬崖绝壁上红旗招展，爆破声接连不断。为了在悬崖上开出两条公路，为了把高达一百四十公尺的主坝深深地嵌在岸石里，腰拴安全带的健儿们，敏捷地剥落着岩层。
    河左岸的导流隧洞是今年三关中的第一关。在今年元旦，开工后不过几十天，上导坑就被英雄们打穿了。隧洞好像一条弯曲的长龙，头枕在上游的河岸边，尾巴垂在下游。不久以后，当截流时刻到来的时候，它就要张开大口，吞掉滚滚黄水！
    这条导流隧洞直径十四公尺，包括五个支洞在内，都可开进列车。根据设计，工人们要分几路钻进洞里，掏出十三万方石块。
    愈深入洞里，人们的行动愈加艰难。洞里空气稀薄，放一炮，烟雾会堵在洞子里一时出不来。可是，英雄们提出要“争取时间，分秒不让”。每逢炮音一落，扒渣组就猛力冲上去，迅速扒开石渣，为钻工打开通道。二中队首先创造了日进六点六公尺的新纪录，接着，三中队八公尺，一中队八点一公尺，十点六五公尺……。元旦一时三十分，爆炸组放完最后一炮不久，不知是谁一声惊喜地叫喊：“透了！”等在两头的英雄们随即蜂拥而上，从炸开的洞口里钻过来，热烈地相互拥抱，欢呼。第一个回合胜利了！
    严重的战斗还在前面。上导坑的工作量，不过占总工作量的十分之一，而时间只剩下两个多月了。这时要把十三万多方石块从洞里打掉，清理出来，还得要付出更大的精力和智慧。打通第一关，紧接着要打截流关，那是一场更加严重的战斗。全工地的战斗人员鼓足了冲天干劲。第一个枯水季节决不让它轻易过去，他们要用创造性的劳动迎接新的胜利！（附图片）
