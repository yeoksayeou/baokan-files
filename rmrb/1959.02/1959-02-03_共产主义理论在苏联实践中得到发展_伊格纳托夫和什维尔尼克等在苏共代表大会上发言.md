Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 2nd. The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued its meeting in the Grand Kremlin Palace at 10:00 AM Moscow time today, discussing Khrushchev's report.

　　The first speaker at the morning session was Novikov, Minister of Power Station Construction of the Soviet Union. When talking about the broad prospects of the development of electrification in the Soviet Union, he said that the Soviet Union would build new power stations with a total power generation capacity of 58 million to 60 million kilowatts in seven years. The power generation capacity of these power stations is equal to the total power generation capacity of the power stations built by countries such as Britain, France, and West Germany since their founding.

　　Novikov said that the further development of the national economy is inseparable from electrification. In the Seven-Year Plan, the amount of electricity used in production will increase four times, and the amount of electricity used in life will also increase greatly.

　　Novikov said that in seven years, the designed power generation capacity of various power stations will increase by 112%, and the power generation capacity of newly built power stations will be more than that of the past 41 years.

　　The next speaker was Ignatov, member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee. He said that the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy in 1959-1965 is currently the focus of attention of foreign public opinion. He pointed out that the position of the Yugoslav press is strange. No objective discussion of the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan can be found in Yugoslav newspapers. He said, are some people in Yugoslavia trying to conceal the achievements of the Soviet Union from the working people of their own country, so as to once again receive rewards from imperialism?

　　In his speech, Ignatov condemned the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov. He said that they embarked on a shameful and insidious path of factional activities. The crushing of the anti-Party group further consolidated the ranks of our Party.

　　Ignatov said that the theoretical principles expounded by Khrushchev in his report to the 21st Congress of the CPSU will be included in the new program of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which is currently being drafted.

　　Ignatov said that the task of producing 10 billion to 11 billion poods of grain in 1965 can be achieved. There is no doubt that this task can be overfulfilled.

　　Ignatov said that when talking about the need to expand agricultural products, especially livestock products, members of the anti-Party group once accused our cadres of being pragmatists and transactionalists. The Central Committee refuted this argument. The reporter said that when talking about the welfare of the people, this is not pragmatism, but policy.

　　When talking about the potential of the collective farm system, Ignatov pointed out that even the arduous task of producing 16 million tons of meat in the last year of the Seven-Year Plan can not only be completed, but also overfulfilled.

　　Ignatov said that in 1958, the Soviet Union produced 57.8 million tons of milk, 700,000 tons more than the United States. When talking about the further growth of milk production, Ignatov talked about the need to expand the feed base for animal husbandry, especially the planting area of ​​maize. He emphasized that it is very important to improve the work of scientific research institutions in agriculture, whose mission is to give practical help to collective farmers.

　　Ignatov said that the Soviet people are convinced that they will win the victory in the competition with the United States in terms of agricultural product output per capita.

　　Yefremov, First Secretary of the CPSU Kuibyshev Oblast Committee, said that in the context of the great achievements made in the development of industry and agriculture in the past year, the activities of the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov appear particularly despicable. They attempted to obstruct the implementation of the resolutions of the 20th Congress and prevent the development of the national economy. After this group was exposed, the work became much simpler and easier.

　　Yefremov said that Kuibyshev Oblast's product production plan for 1958 was completed ahead of schedule. In 1959, the oil extracted in Kuibyshev Oblast will be 11% to 12% more than the oil production of all oil fields in Baku.

　　Nuriyev, First Secretary of the Bashkir Autonomous Republic Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, said in his speech that the Bashkir Autonomous Republic is not only a republic that produces oil, but also a region with a large-scale chemical industry.

　　Nuriyev said that the Communists and all the working people of Bashkir Autonomous Republic had jubilantly welcomed Khrushchev's draft report on the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. In recent years, the people of Bashkir have achieved greater development in economy and culture, and established multi-sector industries. In 1958 alone, the amount of oil extracted in Bashkir was one and a half times more than the amount of oil extracted in the entire Tsarist Russia in 1913. Nuriyev said that the working people of Bashkir clearly know that their achievements are inseparable from the assistance of the Russian nation and other fraternal nations in the country.

　　Then Shvernik, member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, spoke. He emphasized that in the three years since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Soviet Union has not only accumulated strength in quantity, but also undergone favorable qualitative changes, making it possible to lay a material and technical foundation for the comprehensive development of communist society.

　　Shvernik talked about the achievements of socialist construction in the Soviet Union. He said that these achievements are the inevitable result of the development of the Soviet economy and culture under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its Leninist Central Committee.

　　Shvernik then said that the theory of communist construction has been brilliantly enriched and further developed in practice. This is of great significance not only for the Soviet state, but also for further uniting the forces of the international communist movement and the workers' movement under the banner of socialism and peace.

　　Shvernik said that after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, our country completely restored the Leninist norms of Party life and the principle of collective leadership. The Leninist Central Committee strictly adheres to the principle of collective leadership and discusses important and urgent issues with all the people. Shvernik said that the Soviet people's discussion and approval of Khrushchev's draft report to the 21st Congress of the Party is a powerful proof of this.

　　Shvernik said that holding regular meetings of workers in various industrial and agricultural sectors, conducting nationwide discussions on draft resolutions of the Party, and the masses actively participating in the formulation of national economic plans have become forms of attracting the masses to participate in state management.

　　Shvernik then said that the 20th Congress called on the entire Party to thoroughly correct the destruction of revolutionary socialist legality, which had accumulated for a long time due to the adverse effects of the cult of personality. Shvernik said that as a result, those Communists who had been expelled from the Party for fabricated serious political crimes have now returned to the Party.

　　Shvernik said that those who were groundlessly expelled from the Party were mainly Party, economic, military, and other leading cadres. The materials of the rehabilitation cases in the court system prove that the accusations at that time were unfounded and were a crude destruction of socialist legality due to the cult of personality and its consequences. Shvernik added that the destroyers of socialist legality have been or are being subjected to Party disciplinary action.

　　Machyushkin, First Secretary of the Krasnodar Krai Committee of the CPSU, said that the scientifically based program of communist construction embodied in the figures of the Seven-Year Plan reflects the fundamental interests of all workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals of the Soviet state. The working people of our krai are determined to complete this program ahead of schedule.

　　The speaker talked in detail about the prospects for the development of agriculture in Krasnodar Krai. Machyushkin pointed out that the krai has created all the prerequisites to surpass the state of Iowa in the United States in terms of livestock product output in 1961.

　　At the morning meeting, representatives of the Communist Party of the United States, the Communist Party of Syria, the Communist Party of Venezuela, and the Communist Party of Iraq delivered congratulatory messages. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by the participants.

    共产主义理论在苏联实践中得到发展
    伊格纳托夫和什维尔尼克等在苏共代表大会上发言
    新华社莫斯科2日电　苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会今天上午十时（莫斯科时间）在大克里姆林宫继续举行会议，讨论赫鲁晓夫的报告。
    在上午会议上首先发言的是苏联电站建设部部长诺维科夫。他在谈到苏联电气化发展的广阔前景时说，苏联在七年内将建设总发电能力为五千八百万到六千万瓩的新发电站。这些电站的发电能力等于英国、法国和西德等国自建国以来所建设的电站发电能力的总和。
    诺维科夫说，国民经济的进一步发展是和电气化分不开的。在七年计划中，生产的用电量将增加四倍，生活中的用电也将大大增加。
    诺维科夫说，七年中，各电站的设计发电能力要增加112％，新建设的发电站的发电能力将比过去四十一年还要多。
    接着发言的是苏共中央主席团委员伊格纳托夫。他说，1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的七年计划是国外舆论界目前注意的中心。他指出，南斯拉夫报刊的立场令人奇怪。在南斯拉夫的报纸上找不到对苏联的七年计划的客观讨论。他说，在南斯拉夫有人是不是想在本国劳动人民面前掩盖苏联的成就，从而再一次得到帝国主义的赏赐。
    伊格纳托夫在发言中谴责了马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团。他说，他们走上了可耻的、阴险的派别活动的道路。反党集团的被粉碎更进一步地巩固了我们党的队伍。
    伊格纳托夫说，赫鲁晓夫在向苏共第二十一次代表大会作的报告中所阐述的理论原理将列入目前正在拟定的苏联共产党的新纲领中。
    伊格纳托夫说，在1965年生产一百亿到一百一十亿普特的谷物的任务是可以实现的。这一任务可能超额完成，对于这一点是无可怀疑的。
    伊格纳托夫说，当谈到必须扩大农产品、特别是畜产品的时候，反党集团的成员曾经责备我们的干部是实际主义者和事务主义者。中央委员会反击了这种论调。报告人说，当谈到人民的福利时，这就不是什么实际主义，而是政策。
    伊格纳托夫在谈到集体农庄制度拥有的潜力时指出，甚至像在七年计划的最后一年，生产一千六百万吨肉类这样的艰巨任务，不仅能完成，而且能超额完成。
    伊格纳托夫说，1958年苏联生产了五千七百八十万吨奶类，比美国多七十万吨。在谈到奶类生产的进一步增长的问题时，伊格纳托夫谈到必须扩大畜牧业的饲料基地，特别是玉蜀黍的播种面积。他强调指出改进农业方面的科学研究机关的工作是很重要的，其使命是给集体农民以实际帮助。
    伊格纳托夫说，苏联人民深信，他们在按人口平均计算的农产品产量方面将赢得同美国竞赛的胜利。
    苏共古比雪夫州委员会第一书记叶弗列莫夫发言说，在近一年来工农业发展中所获得的巨大成就的情况下，马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁、谢皮洛夫反党集团的活动显得格外卑鄙。他们企图阻挠第二十次代表大会的决议的实现，阻止国民经济的发展。在这个集团被揭露以后，工作就变得简单和容易得多了。
    叶弗列莫夫说，古比雪夫州1958年的产品生产计划提前完成
  了。1959年，古比雪夫州开采的石
  油将比巴库所有油田的产油量多
  11％到12％。
    苏联共产党巴什基尔自治共和国委员会第一书记努里耶夫在发言时说，巴什基尔自治共和国不仅是一个生产石油的共和国，而且是一个具有大规模化学工业的地区。
    努里耶夫说，巴什基尔的共产党员和全体劳动人民曾经兴高采烈地欢迎赫鲁晓夫关于苏联发展国民经济七年计划的报告提纲。最近几年巴什基尔人民在经济上和文化上获得了更大的发展，建立了多部门的工业。在1958年，仅巴什基尔一地的石油开采量就比1913年整个沙皇俄国的石油开采量还多一倍半。努里耶夫说，巴什基尔劳动人民清楚地知道，他们取得的成就是同俄罗斯民族和国内其他兄弟民族的援助分不开的。
    接着苏共中央主席团委员什维尔尼克发言。他强调说，在苏共第二十次代表大会以后的三年内，苏联不仅在数量上积累了力量，而且也发生了有利的质变，使得有可能为全面展开共产主义社会建设奠定物质技术基础。
    什维尔尼克谈到了苏联社会主义建设的成就。他说，这些成就是苏联经济和文化在苏联共产党和它的列宁主义中央委员会领导下发展的必然结果。
    什维尔尼克接着说，共产主义建设的理论在实践中得到了光辉的充实和进一步的发展。这不仅对于苏维埃国家，而且对于在社会主义和和平的旗帜下进一步团结国际共产主义运动和工人运动的力量具有巨大意义。
    什维尔尼克说，在苏共第二十次代表大会以后，我国完全恢复了党的生活的列宁主义准则，恢复了集体领导的原则。列宁主义的中央委员会极严格地遵守集体领导的原则，同全体人民一道讨论重要的和迫切的问题。什维尔尼克说，苏联人民讨论和赞同赫鲁晓夫向党的第二十一次代表大会的报告提纲，就有力地证明了这一点。
    什维尔尼克说，定期举行工农业各部门工作人员的会议，对党的决议草案进行全民讨论，群众积极参加制订国民经济计划，这一切已经成为吸引群众参加国家管理的形式。
    什维尔尼克接着说，第二十次代表大会号召全党彻底纠正对于革命的社会主义法制的破坏，这种破坏现象是由于个人迷信的不良影响而长期积累下来的。什维尔尼克说，结果那些曾经由于虚构的严重政治罪行而被开除出党的共产党员，现在重新回到党内来了。
    什维尔尼克说，被无端从党内开除出去的主要是党的、经济的、军事的和其他领导干部。法院系统中恢复名誉案件的材料证明，当时的控告是无缘无故的，是由于个人迷信及其后果而对社会主义法制的粗暴的破坏。什维尔尼克补充说，社会主义法制的破坏者已经或正在受到党纪处分。
    苏共克拉斯诺达边疆区委员会第一书记马丘什金说，体现在七年计划数字中的有科学根据的共产主义建设纲领反映了苏维埃国家全体工人、集体农民和知识分子的根本利益。我们边疆区的劳动人民决心提前完成这个纲领。
    发言人详细地谈到克拉斯诺达边疆区发展农业的前景。马丘什金指出，边疆区已经创造出一切前提，以便在1961年在畜产品的产量方面超过美国的衣阿华州。
    在上午会议上，美国共产党、叙利亚共产党、委内瑞拉共产党和伊拉克共产党的代表致了贺词。他们的讲话受到了与会者的热烈欢迎。
