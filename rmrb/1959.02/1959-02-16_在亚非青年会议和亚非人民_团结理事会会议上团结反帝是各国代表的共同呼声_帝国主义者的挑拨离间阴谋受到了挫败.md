Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 14th: (By our reporter) The spirit of unity and anti-imperialism permeated the two consecutive meetings held here – the Asian-African Youth Conference and the recently concluded Asian-African People's Solidarity Council meeting. Representatives from across Asia and Africa issued a common call at these two meetings, strongly condemning imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, and declaring their unity to strengthen the struggle for independence and peace.

    The struggle of the African people for independence and against colonial oppression was the focus of attention at both meetings, and both passed resolutions supporting this struggle. Representatives from Algeria and other regions engaged in struggle received particularly warm welcomes. When a group of Kenyan delegates at the Asian-African Youth Conference held aloft a huge portrait of their nationalist leader Kenyatta, the whole venue erupted in cheers, creating a heated and moving atmosphere. The Congolese people's resistance against colonial rule is new evidence of the awakening of the African lion. Due to the "iron curtain" laid down by imperialism, the Congolese representatives could not attend these two meetings, but the Congolese people's struggle received tremendous sympathy and support.

    At these two meetings, the most vicious enemy of the Asian-African people and the people of the world – U.S. imperialism – was strongly condemned. The representatives' speeches eloquently proved that U.S. imperialism is synonymous with aggression, subversion, threats of war, and colonial oppression. Calls were made and resolutions passed demanding that U.S. troops withdraw from Chinese territory Taiwan, U.S. troops withdraw from South Korea, the United States stop interfering in South Vietnam, the United States return Okinawa, the United States stop helping France suppress the Algerian people, and the United States abolish its military bases on the two continents. The two meetings also condemned the United States for interfering in Indonesia, the United States for interfering in Jordan, the United States for exerting pressure on Cambodia, and the United States for practicing racial discrimination at home.

    The fierce anti-imperialist sentiment, particularly against U.S. imperialism, displayed at the Asian-African Youth Conference surprised some Western journalists. They had tried in vain to stir up trouble, sow discord, and distort the spirit of the meeting in their reports.

    However, the main current of unity and anti-imperialism triumphed over the countercurrent that the Western imperialists attempted to stir up.

    The incident occurred on February 4 at a meeting of the Political Committee of the Asian-African Youth Conference. South Vietnamese delegates and some Japanese delegates suggested that in addition to mentioning anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism in the resolution, "anti-communism" should also be mentioned.

    Then, the delegate from Nigeria spoke: "We oppose this suggestion. From our own experience, we do not feel any threat from communism. The only thing that threatens us is imperialism and colonialism." A Kenyan delegate said: "This is a trick to divert attention, the purpose of which is to weaken the anti-imperialist struggle. We are not threatened by communism; on the contrary, the Soviet Union and China give us tremendous support." He said to the South Vietnamese delegates: "What concerns you is: South Vietnam should be liberated from the enslavement of the United States."

    Faced with this situation, the South Vietnamese delegation retreated from the venue in great embarrassment.

    This scene proves that the Asian-African people know from their own experience how to distinguish friends from enemies.

    Unity – this is the most powerful weapon for the Asian-African people to defeat imperialism. The process of these two meetings shows that the Asian-African people are very aware of the need to strengthen unity and support each other among all anti-imperialist forces. For this reason, the Chinese representative's proposal to unite all anti-imperialist forces to crush the imperialists' destructive conspiracies was warmly welcomed at the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council meeting.

    在亚非青年会议和亚非人民
    团结理事会会议上团结反帝是各国代表的共同呼声
    帝国主义者的挑拨离间阴谋受到了挫败
    据新华社开罗14日电　本社记者报道：团结和反对帝国主义的精神贯串着在这里接连举行的两个会议——亚非青年会议和刚刚结束的亚非人民团结理事会会议。亚非各地的代表在这两个会议上发出了共同呼声，强烈谴责帝国主义、尤其是美帝国主义，并且宣布团结一致来加强争取独立和和平的斗争。
    非洲人民争取独立和反对殖民主义压迫的斗争是这两个会议注意的中心，两个会议都通过了决议支持这个斗争。阿尔及利亚和其他正在进行斗争的地区的代表受到了格外热烈的欢迎。当参加亚非青年会议的一群怯尼亚代表举着他们民族主义领袖肯雅塔的巨幅画像的时候，全场响起了一阵阵的欢呼声，气氛热烈而动人。刚果人民的反抗殖民统治的事件是非洲狮子觉醒的新证据。由于帝国主义布下的“铁幕”，刚果的代表不能参加这两个会议，但是刚果人民的斗争得到了巨大同情和支持。
    在这两个会议上，亚非人民和世界人民最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义遭到强烈的谴责。代表们的发言雄辩地证明，美帝国主义就是侵略、颠复、战争威胁和殖民压迫的同义语。会上发出了呼声并且通过了决议，要求美军撤出中国领土台湾，美军撤出南朝鲜，美国停止干涉南越，美国归还冲绳岛，美国停止帮助法国镇压阿尔及利亚人民，取消美国在这两大洲的军事基地。这两个会议还谴责了美国干涉印度尼西亚，美国干涉约旦，美国对柬埔寨施加压力以及美国在国内实行种族歧视等行为。
    亚非青年会议上表现出来的反对帝国主义、特别是反对美帝国主义的激烈情绪使某些西方记者感到意外。他们曾经徒劳地兴风作浪，挑拨离间，并且对会议的精神作了歪曲报道。
    但是，团结和反帝的主流战胜了西方帝国主义者所企图搅起的逆流。
    事情发生在2月4日亚非青年会议政治委员会会议上。南越代表们和一些日本代表建议在决议中，除了提到反帝国主义和反殖民主义之外，还要提到“反共产主义”。
    接着尼日利亚的代表发了言：“我们反对这个建议。我们从自己的经验中并不觉得有来自共产主义的任何威胁。威胁着我们的只有帝国主义和殖民主义。”怯尼亚代表说：“这是一个转移目标的诡计，其目的在于削弱反帝国主义斗争。我们并不受到共产主义的威胁，恰恰相反，苏联和中国给予我们巨大的支持。”他对着南越代表说：“同你们相关的是：南越应该从美国的奴役下解放出来。”
    南越代表团在面临这种情况之下，非常狼狈地退出了会场。
    这个场面证明亚非人民从切身经验中懂得如何识别朋友和敌人。
    团结一致——这是亚非人民击败帝国主义的最强有力的武器。这两个会议的过程表明亚非人民非常懂得一切反对帝国主义的力量加强团结、互相支持的必要性。正因为这样，中国代表要求把一切反帝力量团结起来以粉碎帝国主义的破坏阴谋的主张，在亚非人民团结理事会会议上受到了热烈的欢迎。
