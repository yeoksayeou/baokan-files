Why

    Wrathful Hair Can Lift the Hat

    We often use the phrase "wrathful hair can lift the hat" to describe someone's extreme anger. As to whether a person's hair can actually lift their hat when they are enraged, it's something we rarely consider.

    In fact, people can "lift" their hats when they are angry. The reason is this: at the base of each of our hairs is a follicle, and next to the follicle is a small muscle with nerve fibers distributed on it. The characteristic of muscle is that it contracts when stimulated. When someone gets angry, this "excitement" travels from the brain along the nerves to the muscles next to the hair follicles, and then the muscles contract (because the "excitement" from the brain is also a stimulus). This pulls on the follicles, causing them to stand up slightly, which in turn causes the hair to stand up slightly, so the hat may be moved.

    The same phenomenon occurs when a person is frightened, so people use "I was so scared my hair stood on end" to describe the degree of terror. (Ding)

专栏：为什么

    怒发能冲冠
    我们常用怒发冲冠四个字来形容一个人盛怒的样子。至于人被激怒之后，究竟头发能不能把帽子冲起来，就很少去考虑了。
    事实上，人们在发怒时是可以将帽子“冲”起来的。原因是这样：在我们每根毛发的根部都有毛囊包裹着，在毛囊旁有一小条肌肉，在肌肉上分布着神经纤维。肌肉的特点是遇到刺激就收缩。当某人发怒时，他这种“兴奋”就从大脑沿着神经而传到了毛囊旁的肌肉，于是肌肉就收缩了（因为从大脑发出的“兴奋”也是刺激。）。这样就牵动了毛囊，使毛囊稍稍竖起，同时也就带动了毛发稍稍竖直，于是帽子就有被牵动的可能了。
    一个人恐惧时也会发生同样现象，所以人们用“吓得我头发都竖起来了”来形容惊恐的程度。　（仃）
