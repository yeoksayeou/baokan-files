Spring is Strong in High and Cold Mountain Areas
By Our Correspondent Zhai Qiyin

A few days before the Spring Festival, I came to the Lotus People's Commune in Qin'an County. Here, ice and snow still seal the surface of the Deep Water River, but the fields, streets, and villages of the Lotus Commune are full of the warm atmosphere of spring! Girls are carrying fertilizer on Lotus Street, and young men are breaking ice in the ditches to preserve soil moisture; some are building dams, and others are planting trees on dangerous cliffs; in the management area office, the sound of abacuses can be heard, as they rush to pay wages to commune members before the festival.... Everyone is busy, full of confidence, and immensely happy. All this conquers the severe winter.

I came to the office of Chen Yaode, director of the Star Management Area, but he and Guo Xiaoye, the general branch secretary, had gone with the masses to carry manure.

Speaking of these two people, the commune members told me that whether they go to inspect production or attend meetings, they always carry manure baskets, collecting three to five baskets of manure every day. Under their influence, more than 100 cadres in this management area all carry manure baskets. The Star Management Area has become a red banner for manure accumulation in the entire commune. They are making rapid progress, maintaining high quality, and using many methods. As of now, they have completed more than 80% of the total annual manure accumulation.

These days, all workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers in the commune have been swept up in the high tide of manure accumulation. The news reached the nursing home, making the elderly restless. They formed the "Huang Zhong Manure Accumulation Team" to compete with the young people. Grandpa Sang Shiren is sixty-five years old this year, and he is full of energy, collecting manure all over the mountains and fields. The children are not lagging behind either, they formed the "Luo Cheng Company", becoming a strong force in production and manure accumulation.

In Lotus City, women are carrying fertilizer with vigorous and powerful steps. They came head-on, one after another. A comrade told me, "This is the famous women's satellite company – the Hundred Flowers Combat Regiment."

Last year, they used their own hands to launch high-yield satellites of corn and millet in this "barren" high and cold mountain area. With curiosity, I came with them to the foot of the mountain ridge. This is a large open field, the garden-like project covered with auspicious snow, unfolding neatly before my eyes. I squatted down, brushed away the light snow, and underneath was the thick manure and the lush and dense wheat seedlings. What tremendous labor they have put in! I deeply believe that their "satellite" this year will be launched even higher and brighter than last year!

    高寒山区春意浓 
    本报记者　翟其寅
    我在春节前几天来到秦安县莲花人民公社。这里冰雪还封冻着深水河面，可是莲花公社的田野，街头，村庄里，却是热气洋溢的春天了！姑娘们在莲花街上搬运着肥料，小伙子在河沟里破冰保墒；有人在筑坝，有人在危崖削壁间造林；管理区的办公室里，响着算盘声，这是在节前给社员赶发工资……。人人繁忙，充满信心、无比欢乐，这一切征服了严寒的冬天。
    我来到明星管理区的主任办公室，主任陈耀德和总支书记郭孝业同群众一道背粪去了。
    提起这两个人，社员告诉我，他们无论是去检查生产，或者是参加会议，总是带着粪筐，每天要拾上三五筐粪。在他们的影响下，这个管理区一百多名干部，没有一个不背粪筐的。明星管理区已经成为全公社积肥的一面红旗，他们进度快，质量高，办法多，截至现在，已经完成全年积肥总量的80％多。
    这几天，全公社的工农商学兵，都卷进了积肥高潮。风声传进敬老院，使年迈的老人也坐立不安，他们组成了“黄忠积肥队”，要与小伙子们比高低。桑世仁大爷今年六十五岁了，他精神饱满，满山遍野去拾粪。孩子们也不落后，他们组成了“罗成连”，成为生产和积肥的一支强大力量。
    在莲花城里，妇女们踩着矫健有力的步伐，抢运着肥料。她们迎面鱼贯而来，一个不让一个。一位同志告诉我，“这就是著名的妇女卫星连——百花战斗团”。
    去年，她们用自己的双手，在这片“贫瘠”的高寒山区放了玉米和谷子的高产卫星。我怀着好奇的心情，跟她们一起来到山梁下。这是一大片开阔的田野，被瑞雪复盖着的园田化工程，平整地展开在眼前。我蹲下去，拨开轻盈的白雪，下面是肥厚的粪土和茁壮茂密的小麦苗。她们花了多么巨大的劳动呵！我深深地相信，她们今年的“卫星”一定会比去年放得更高更亮！
