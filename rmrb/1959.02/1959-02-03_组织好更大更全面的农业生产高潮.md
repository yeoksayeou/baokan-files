Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd – The National Rural Work Department Conference convened by the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has concluded. The central topic of the conference was: to discuss the implementation of the resolution on several issues concerning the People's Communes adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, analyze the rural situation since communization; and how to adapt to the needs of a larger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, and strengthen and improve the operation and management of rural people's communes. The conference pointed out: Since communization, the rural situation is unprecedentedly good. The political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers have shown an unprecedented upsurge. The resolution on several issues concerning the People's Communes formulated by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party has been widely supported by the vast number of cadres and the masses in rural areas. At present, rural people's communes are continuing to advance victoriously. The rural rectification movement is unfolding comprehensively and preliminarily in various places, and a new, larger, and more comprehensive production upsurge is forming.

The conference began on January 13 and ended on January 26, lasting fourteen days. The participants in the conference were mainly the heads of the rural work departments of the Party committees of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, as well as individual directors of people's communes. After analyzing the rural situation since communization, the conference immediately turned to discuss a series of issues centered on the operation and management of communes, such as how to earnestly carry forward the great victorious experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, summon up greater energy, and strive for a greater leap forward in 1959. In particular, how communes can rationally arrange and use labor, strengthen technological reforms, and improve labor productivity, first ensuring the completion of the two major production increase targets for grain and cotton this year, while also achieving a comprehensive revolution in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries.

The conference pointed out: Since communization, people's communes in various places have achieved great successes in developing industrial and agricultural production and running collective welfare undertakings, etc. The tremendous superiority of the people's communes is even more significant. After the promulgation of the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning the People's Communes," the vast number of cadres and the masses have improved their understanding and have a powerful ideological weapon for running and consolidating the communes, and they are even more confident. Now, the pilot work of commune rectification in various places has ended one after another, and the rectification movement is unfolding comprehensively according to the pilot experience, and rural people's communes are developing towards the consolidation stage. On this basis, a new winter production upsurge centered on accumulating manure is emerging in rural areas.

The conference believed that in the commune rectification work, it is still necessary to continue to implement the principle of combining grasping ideology, grasping production, and grasping life; using the resolution on several issues concerning the People's Communes as a weapon to further enable cadres and the masses to draw clear ideological and policy boundaries, and to continue to care about the lives of the broad masses, are all very important. However, what is more important at present is to grasp production. The broad masses, especially the former poor and lower-middle peasants, have great enthusiasm for demanding that the commune rapidly develop industrial and agricultural production and strive for a greater leap forward, which must be fully estimated. For example, when Jianchapu Commune in Baxian County, Hebei Province, discussed this year's rice production target, most of the commune members proposed to strive for a yield of 5,000 jin per mu on a large area, and some even proposed to strive for a yield of 7,000 jin per mu. Some counties and communes in Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong, Hebei and other places have proposed to strive for a yield of 1,000 jin per mu of wheat on a large area. At present, the winter manure accumulation movement and wheat field management movement are unfolding vigorously. All of these fully prove that the masses' demands for a greater leap forward are very urgent, and they are very confident. The conference pointed out that any ideological tendency that underestimates the determination and energy of the broad masses to strive for a greater leap forward should be continuously opposed. The conference believes that in the rectification of communes, all localities should take production as the center, and first of all, organize the current production upsurge well, and launch a lively mass competition movement, which is a communist-style mutual competition, but also a competition movement of mutual care, mutual assistance, and mutual promotion. In 1958, various localities accumulated a complete set of working experience in leading production by following the mass line, which is to plant experimental fields, hold on-site meetings, organize large-scale visits, inspections, evaluations, socialist competitions, and so on. This set of new experiences in the Great Leap Forward should continue to be carried forward in the current work.

The conference believes that improving the operation and management level of the people's communes is an important guarantee for a greater leap forward this year. The people's communes are large and public, and should implement a higher level of planned management than agricultural cooperatives under the guidance of the unified national plan. Unified plans and proper arrangements should be made in all aspects, including industrial and agricultural production, labor allocation, procurement and supply, financial work, consumption accumulation, income distribution, capital construction, and transportation. In terms of production plans, the commune should have four types of plans, namely, long-term construction plans for three to five years, annual plans, seasonal or quarterly plans, and small-scale operation or monthly plans; and the commune's plans should be combined with the national plan through procurement, supply, and other contract systems. The conference believes that in terms of labor arrangement and use, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the policy of simultaneously developing industrial production and agricultural production, and simultaneously developing self-sufficient production and commodity production. Under the condition of appropriately meeting the labor required by national industry, the commune must first ensure the completion of the main production targets such as grain, cotton, and oil this year, and appropriately adjust the proportion of labor used for current production and capital construction; at the same time, it is also necessary to take overall consideration to enable the diversified economy to be greatly developed and to achieve a comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. This year, at least make the income from industries other than agriculture account for about 30% of the total income. After a comprehensive study of the allocation and use of labor, the conference believes that it is necessary to seize the opportunity to vigorously carry out tool reforms, improve labor management, improve manure accumulation methods, eliminate labor waste, and do a good job in the commune's political and economic work, etc., to improve labor productivity and gradually increase the actual output per labor day. Increasing the actual output per labor day is an extremely important issue at present. In terms of labor management, the conference believes that it is particularly necessary to implement the quota management system and implement the production responsibility system. The layered contracting responsibility system, as well as the five fixed tasks assigned to the fields, responsibility assigned to teams and individuals, inspection and acceptance systems, etc., which were once effective in agricultural cooperatives, should continue to be widely promoted, and gradually enriched and improved in practice to make them more perfect. In carrying out certain shock movements, it is necessary to maintain relatively fixed labor forces in the management area and production team, so as to continue to carry out regular production. In addition, it is also important to regularly organize evaluations and competitions and establish appropriate labor discipline, attendance, and reward systems.

Regarding the commune's distribution issue, after calculation, the conference found that due to the bumper harvest last year, more than 80% of the commune members in general communes can increase their income. By further developing sideline production, appropriately adjusting the proportion of accumulation and consumption, adjusting the proportion of supply and wage components, and appropriately adjusting wage grades and differences, most communes can ensure that more than 90% of commune members can increase their income, and the income of the remaining commune members will remain the same. The conference also discussed issues such as the commune's system, finance, and democratic life.

The conference called on all localities to further study, publicize, and implement the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning the People's Communes," to use socialist and communist education as the guiding principle for rectifying and consolidating the people's communes; at the same time, adopt the method of vigorously carrying out mass movements, fully develop democracy, fully trust the masses, follow the mass line, boldly mobilize the masses, and fully use the great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters to ensure that the commune rectification work is carried out in depth and thoroughly. After rectification, the people's communes will be universally consolidated and improved, so that the democratic atmosphere in the vast rural areas and the masses' enthusiasm for socialist construction will be even higher, and the production upsurge will be organized on a larger, better, and more comprehensive scale.

Before the end of the conference, Comrade Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Deng Zihui, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Comrade Chen Zhengren, Deputy Minister, made important speeches on the current rural work. They pointed out that the primary task at present is: to lead the rural people's communes across the country, continue to summon up revolutionary vigor, strive for advancement, fully carry forward the achievements and experience of 1958, work hard, work practically, and work skillfully, and launch a vigorous winter production upsurge led by fertilizer, manage overwintering crops well, and make preparations for spring plowing, first striving for a bumper harvest in summer, and laying the foundation for a greater leap forward throughout the year. They emphasized that the conditions for realizing a greater leap forward in agricultural production this year are unprecedentedly favorable. With the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, the experience of the Great Leap Forward last year, the improvement of the management level of the people's communes, and the ideological emancipation of the people, after the entire Party and the entire people continue to work hard, it will definitely be possible to guarantee the completion of all the tasks of a larger, better, and more comprehensive leap forward on the agricultural front in 1959.

### 组织好更大更全面的农业生产高潮

    发扬去年伟大胜利的经验　运用今年空前有利的条件
    组织好更大更全面的农业生产高潮
    全国农村工作部长会议强调整社工作要以生产为中心人民公社必须在国家统一计划指导下实行比农业社更高的计划管理
    新华社2日讯　中共中央农村工作部召开的全国农村工作部长会议已经结束。会议的中心议题是：讨论贯彻执行八届六中全会关于人民公社若干问题的决议，分析公社化以来的农村形势；以及如何适应1959年更大更好更全面地跃进形势的需要，加强和改进农村人民公社的经营管理问题。会议指出：公社化以来，农村情况是空前良好的。广大农民群众的政治热情和生产热情表现了从来未有的高涨。党的八届六中全会所制定的关于人民公社若干问题的决议，得到了农村广大干部和群众的普遍拥护。目前农村人民公社正在继续乘胜前进。各地农村的整社运动正在全面的初步展开，新的更大的更全面的生产高潮正在形成。
    会议从1月13日开始，26日结束，历时十四天。参加会议的主要是各省、市、自治区党委的农村工作部的负责人，也有个别人民公社的社主任。会议在分析了公社化以来的农村形势之后，即转入以公社经营管理为中心，如何认真地发扬1958年大跃进的伟大胜利的经验，鼓足干劲，争取1959年更大跃进等一系列问题的讨论。特别是公社怎样合理安排使用劳动力，加强技术改革，提高劳动生产率，首先保证完成今年粮食和棉花的两大增产指标，同时实现农林牧副渔全线大革命的问题。
    会议指出：公社化以来，各地人民公社在发展工农业生产和办好集体生活福利事业等等方面，都取得了很大成绩。人民公社的巨大优越性更加显著。“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”公布后，广大干部和群众认识提高，对办好和巩固公社有了强有力的思想武器，更加信心百倍。现在，各地整社的试点工作纷纷结束，整社运动正根据试点经验向全面展开，农村人民公社正向着巩固阶段发展。在这个基础上，农村正在出现一个以积肥为中心的新的冬季生产高潮。
    会议认为：整社工作中还须继续贯彻抓思想、抓生产和抓生活相结合的原则；以关于人民公社若干问题的决议为武器，进一步使干部和群众划清思想界线和政策界线，以及继续关心广大群众的生活问题，都很重要。但是当前更加重要的是抓好生产。广大群众特别是过去的贫农和下中农，要求公社迅速发展工农业生产，争取更大跃进的干劲很大，对此，必须作充分地估计。如河北省霸县煎茶铺公社在讨论今年的水稻生产指标时，大多数社员都提出要争取大面积亩产五千斤，有的还提出要争取亩产七千斤，江苏、河南、山东、河北等地一些县和公社都提出要争取小麦大面积亩产千斤。目前冬季积肥运动和麦田管理运动正在轰轰烈烈地展开。所有这些都充分证明群众对更大跃进的要求很迫切，而且信心很高。会议指出：任何对于广大群众要求争取更大跃进的决心和干劲估计不足的思想倾向，都是应该予以继续反对的。会议认为：各地在整社中，应该以生产为中心，首先要组织好当前的生产高潮，展开热火朝天的群众竞赛运动，这就是一种具有共产主义风格的互相竞赛，但是又互相关怀、互相帮助、相互促进的竞赛运动。1958年各地领导生产积累了一整套走群众路线的工作经验，这就是种试验田、开现场会、组织大规模的参观、检查、评比、社会主义的竞赛等等。这一套大跃进中的新的经验，在当前的工作中应该继续发扬。
    会议认为：提高人民公社的经营管理水平是今年更大跃进的一个重要保证。人民公社又大又公，应在国家统一计划指导下实行比农业社更高的计划管理，无论工农业生产、劳动调配、收购供应、财务工作、消费积累、收益分配、基本建设、交通运输等方面都应该有统一的计划和妥善的安排。而在生产计划方面，公社应有四种计划，即三、五年的长远建设规划，年度计划，季节或季度的计划，小段作业或月份的计划；并通过收购、供应等合同制把公社的计划和国家的计划结合起来。会议认为：在劳力安排使用方面，必须认真贯彻工业生产和农业生产同时并举，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针，在适当满足国家工业需要的劳力的条件下，公社内部首先须保证今年粮、棉、油等主要生产指标的完成，适当调整当年生产用工和基本建设用工的比重；同时还要作到全面兼顾，使多种经济得到较大的发展，使农、林、牧、副、渔来一个全面大跃进。今年至少作到农业以外的其他收入占总收入的30％左右。会议经过对劳动力调配使用的全面研究，认为：抓紧大搞工具改革、提高劳动管理、改进积肥方法、消灭劳力浪费现象、做好公社的政治工作和经济工作，等等，以提高劳动生产率，逐步提高每个劳动日的实际产量。而提高每个劳动日的实际生产量是当前的极为重要的问题。在劳动管理方面，会议认为，当前实行定额管理制度和贯彻生产责任制尤为必需。过去农业社曾经行之有效的分层包干责任制，以及五定到田、责任到队到人、检查验收等制度，应当继续广泛推行，并在实践中逐步加以充实和提高，使之更加完善。在进行某些突击运动中，必须保持管理区、生产队有相对固定的劳动力，以便继续进行经常性生产。此外，经常组织评比竞赛和建立适当的劳动纪律、考勤和奖励的制度也很重要。
    关于公社的分配问题，会议经过计算，由于去年大丰收，一般公社80％以上的社员都能增加收入。再通过发展副业生产、适当调整积累和消费的比例、调整供给部分和工资部分的比例、适当调整工资等级和级差等等，就可以使绝大多数公社都可以作到90％以上社员增加收入，其余社员的收入不增不减。关于公社的体制、财务、民主生活等等方面问题，会议也作了讨论。
    会议要求各地进一步学习、宣传和贯彻执行“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，以社会主义和共产主义教育作为整顿巩固人民公社的纲；同时，采取大搞群众运动的方法，充分发扬民主，充分信任群众，走群众路线，放手发动群众，充分运用大鸣大放大辩论和大字报，务使整社工作搞深搞透，经过整顿，使人民公社普遍地得到巩固和提高，使得广大农村的民主空气和群众的社会主义建设积极性更加高涨，生产高潮组织得更大更好更全面。
    会议结束前，中共中央书记处书记谭震林同志、中共中央农村工作部部长邓子恢同志、副部长陈正人同志等对当前的农村工作作了重要讲话。他们指出：当前首要的任务是：领导全国农村人民公社，继续鼓足革命干劲，力争上游，充分发扬1958年的成绩和经验，苦干、实干加巧干，掀起一个干劲冲天的、由肥料挂帅的冬季生产高潮，管好越冬作物和作好春耕准备，首先争取夏季的大丰收，为全年更大跃进打下基础。他们强调指出：实现今年农业生产的更大跃进，条件是空前有利的。有党中央和毛泽东同志的英明正确的领导，有去年的大跃进经验，有人民公社管理水平的提高，有人民群众的思想解放，经过全党全民继续苦战，就一定可以保证完成1959年农业战线更大更好更全面跃进的全部任务。
