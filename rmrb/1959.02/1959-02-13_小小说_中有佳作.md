    There are Masterpieces in “Mini-Novels”
    Last year, many newspapers and literary magazines across the country published a large number of short works under the name "mini-novels," generally only about two thousand words long. Among them were some excellent works that promptly reflected the soaring enthusiasm of the working people during the Great Leap Forward and sketched the spirit and features of the new people. The authors of these works were mostly workers, peasants, and soldiers, and many were writing novels for the first time.
    In his article "The Bumper Harvest of Short Stories and Several Issues in Creation" (see the February issue of "People's Literature" this year), Comrade Mao Dun believes that the style of mini-novels is not only short, concise, and to the point, with concise techniques and vivid and clear language, but also combines the characteristics of features and short stories, becoming a new variety with its own personality. It is one of the literary forms most suitable for amateur writing by the masses in the mass cultural movement. He believes that these works generally shine with the light of revolutionary romanticism and can portray the spiritual outlook of heroic figures on the production front, expressing their communist ideological qualities. Many masterpieces show the budding of great works with a communist national style. The article also analyzes and evaluates, one by one, the ideological content and expression techniques of some excellent works published in newspapers and periodicals last year that have not yet attracted widespread attention, which is helpful for assisting amateur young authors in writing and readers in reading.

    “小小说”中有佳作
    去年，全国不少报纸和文艺杂志，发表了许多以“小小说”为名的短篇创作，一般只两千字左右，其中有一些优秀的作品，它们及时地反映了大跃进中劳动人民的冲天干劲，勾画出了新人物的风貌。这些作品的作者，大部分是工人、农民和士兵，许多人是第一次写小说的。
    茅盾同志在“短篇小说的丰收和创作上的几个问题”（见今年二月号“人民文学”）一文里，认为小小说的样式不仅短小精悍，具有简练的手法和生动鲜明的文字，而且结合特写和短篇小说的特点，成为自有个性的新品种，它是群众文艺运动中最宜于群众业余写作的文学体裁之一。他认为这些作品一般都闪耀着革命浪漫主义的光芒，都能勾画出生产战线上英雄人物的精神面貌；表现了他们的共产主义的思想品质。许多佳作，从它们身上，看出了共产主义的民族风格的大作品的萌芽。文章并对去年报刊上发表的，还未引起人们广泛注意的一部分优秀作品，从思想内容、表现手法一一作了分析评介，这对帮助业余青年作者写作和读者阅读，都是有益的。（让）
