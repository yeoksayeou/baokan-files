However, she fell in both the 500-meter and 1,000-meter races, which affected her results. The all-around rankings for women's speed skating are: Yang Yunxiang, Lu Chengyu, Liu Fengrong, Jin Meiyu (all from Heilongjiang), Jin Yingzi, Cui Shunzi (both from Jilin), Xu Mingshu, and Sun Hongxia (both from Heilongjiang).

    While the National Winter Games was conducting the speed skating competition, figure skating and ice hockey competitions were also held. The figure skating competition received very satisfactory results, with five male athletes and one female athlete exceeding the national standard score (480 points) for figure skating athletes. Yang Jiasheng and Wen Haimei from the Heilongjiang team won the men's and women's figure skating championships, respectively, with scores of 511.93 points and 484.50 points. This year's technical level of figure skating has improved significantly compared to the past. In the men's group, the scores of the second to fifth place winners, Bing Shizhong (Liaoning), Zhao Xiren (Beijing), Bai Kecheng (Beijing), and Liu Qin (Heilongjiang), were all above 480 points. Even the eighth place winner exceeded the standard for first-class athletes. In the competition, many emerging forces used excellent results to step into the ranks of outstanding figure skaters. Wen Haimei, 15, and Cui Ping, 13, from Heilongjiang, and Lu Yaqun, 15, from Beijing, won the first, second, and fourth places in women's figure skating, respectively.
    The ice hockey competition ended on the 18th. The ice hockey teams from the eleven participating units, after eight days and forty fierce games, have all determined their winners and losers.
    The Heilongjiang team, composed of the Harbin team, which has continuously held the national ice hockey championship five times, won the championship in this national ice hockey competition with eight wins in eight games.
    The battle for the runner-up between the Jilin, Liaoning, and Beijing teams was one of the most exciting games in the final stage, and the audience was most enthusiastic. These three teams were evenly matched in strength. At the end of the preliminary round, the Jilin team and the Beijing team each lost one game; the Liaoning team and the Jilin team each won four games. Therefore, who would win the runner-up became the focus of discussion among the audience. The final result was: the Jilin team defeated the Liaoning team and the Beijing team with scores of eleven to two and five to four respectively, taking the runner-up. The Liaoning team ranked third. The Beijing team, which had won the runner-up in the National Ice Hockey Tournament for three consecutive times, although it lost three games and dropped to fourth place, the morale of the players was still very high in the final match with the Heilongjiang team. They played to a score of one to three against the Heilongjiang team, which was the closest score among the seven teams that played against the Heilongjiang team this time.
    The People's Liberation Army team and the Hebei team had the same record of one draw and four losses in the finals, but because the People's Liberation Army team lost fewer goals than the Hebei team, it was ranked fifth and the Hebei team was ranked sixth. The following rankings are Inner Mongolia team, Xinjiang team, Ningxia team, Shaanxi team, and Qinghai team. (Attached pictures)

    全国冬季运动会胜利闭幕 
    黑龙江队夺得滑冰团体总分、速滑、花样和冰球冠军
    本报讯　在哈尔滨举行的1959年全国冬季运动会19日闭幕。黑龙江队夺得冰上运动部分的团体总分和男女速滑、花样、冰球比赛的冠军。
    这次全国冬季运动会是我国今年最早举行的全国性体育比赛之一，也是从1953年第一次全国冰上运动会以来，全国性冰上运动比赛中规模最大的一次。参加这次运动会的三百四十六名运动员，来自北京、山西、内蒙古、宁夏、辽宁、吉林、青海、陕西、河北、新疆、黑龙江等十一个省、市、自治区和中国人民解放军，包括十个民族。
    这次运动会是从2月10日开始举行的，比赛内容有男女速度滑冰、花样滑冰和冰球比赛。作为这次运动会项目之一的滑雪比赛，已提前于1月25日到2月4日在吉林举行，吉林队获得团体总分第一。
    在11日结束的女子速滑比赛中，黑龙江队的杨云香成绩最好，获得一千公尺、三千公尺和速滑全能第一名，她的总成绩是二二二点一四九分。我国著名运动健将孙洪霞（黑龙江），在一千五百公尺比赛中以二分四十二秒三的成绩刷新了她自己在1958年创造的二分四十五秒五的全国纪录，获得第一名。但她在五百和一千公尺的比赛中都摔了跤，影响了成绩。获得女子速度滑冰全能名次是：杨云香、芦成玉、刘凤荣、金美玉（以上均为黑龙江）、金英子、崔顺子（以上为吉林）、许明淑、孙洪霞（均为黑龙江）。
    男子速滑比赛是在12日和13日举行的。黑龙江队的郑弘道获五百公尺、一千公尺速滑冠军和速滑全能冠军，他的全能总分是二○五点四三三分，全能第二名朴达华，第三名林振坤，第四名张朋瑞，第五名金汉珠，第六名罗志辉，都是黑龙江的选手。第七名是北京的王甫东，第八名是崔奎德。
    全国冬季运动会在进行速滑比赛的同时，还分别举行了花样滑冰比赛和冰球比赛。花样滑冰比赛收到了非常令人满意的成绩，有五名男运动员和一名女运动员超过了国家规定的花样滑冰运动健将的分数（四百八十分）。黑龙江队杨家声、文海美分别获得了男女花样滑冰比赛的冠军，他们的成绩分别是五一一点九三分和四八四点五零分。今年花样滑冰的技术水平较以前有显著提高。男子组，第二到第五名的丙世忠（辽宁）赵希人（北京）白克成（北京）刘勤（黑龙江）等的成绩都在四百八十分以上。就是第八名，也超过了一级运动员的标准。在比赛中，许多新生的力量用优异的成绩跨进了优秀花样滑冰运动员的行列。黑龙江的十五岁的文海美、十三岁的崔萍，以及十五岁的北京吕雅群，分别夺得了女子花样的第一、第二、第四的名次。
    冰球比赛在18日结束。参加比赛的十一个单位的冰球队，经过八天四十场的激烈争夺战，胜负已经全部定局。
    由连续五次保持全国冰球冠军的哈尔滨队为骨干组成的黑龙江队，以八战八胜的成绩获得了这次全国冰球比赛的冠军。
    吉林、辽宁和北京三队之间争夺亚军，是决赛阶段最精采、观众情绪最热烈的几场比赛。这三个队，势均力敌，实力相仿。预赛结束时，吉林队与北京队各负一场；辽宁队与吉林队各胜四场。因此，亚军究竟属谁，就成为观众谈论的中心。决赛结果是：吉林队分别以十一比二及五比四战胜辽宁队和北京队，取得亚军。辽宁队名列第三。连获三届全国冰球赛亚军的北京队，虽然打输了三场降为第四，但是最后与黑龙江队交锋中，队员士气仍然十分旺盛。他们与黑龙江队打成一比三，这是此次与黑龙江队交手的七个队中，比数最接近的一场比赛。
    解放军队与河北队在决赛中同样一平四负，但由于解放军队净输的球数少于河北队，因此列为第五，河北队第六。以下的名次是内蒙古队、新疆队、宁夏队、陕西队、青海队。（附图片）
