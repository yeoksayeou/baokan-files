Shandong Cotton Region Vigorously Prepares for Spring Planting

(Our newspaper, Jinan, February 24th) The famous cotton-producing areas of Shandong, including Gaotang, Xiajin, Linqing, and Gaomi counties and cities, are vigorously preparing for cotton spring planting.

Last year, these counties and cities achieved unprecedented bumper harvests of cotton. Linqing City achieved a yield of 155 jin of ginned cotton per mu, Gaotang County 150 jin per mu, Xiajin County 130 jin per mu, and Gaomi County 100 jin per mu. This year, these counties and cities are planting cotton on more than 500,000 to 600,000 mu each. Gaotang and Xiajin counties have set production increase targets of an average of 1,000 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Linqing City plans to increase production by more than double last year, and Gaomi County also plans to increase production by nearly double last year. Now that "Rain Water" has passed and spring has returned to the earth, these counties and cities have begun intense preparations for planting. Linqing City has organized a professional cotton army of 150,000 people, trained 50,000 qualified technicians, and all cotton fields have been deeply ploughed more than one chi deep. Among them, 350,000 mu have been applied with an average of 340,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, with a plan to apply 100,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu before sowing. To preserve soil moisture, the city organized 7,500 head of livestock to harrow the cotton fields three times. A total of 450,000 mu of cotton fields were irrigated last winter and this spring, and it is planned to irrigate all of them once before "Awakening of Insects". 27 million jin of cotton seeds have been prepared, and tools and pesticides have also been prepared. In addition, the city has demarcated more than 2,500 high-yield cotton plots, and in conjunction with plot demarcation, large ridged fields have been prepared.

Xiajin County, in addition to completing deep ploughing and other planting preparations, has begun cotton seedling cultivation. Gaomi County has now accumulated 11.4 billion jin of organic soil fertilizer and prepared more than 38 million jin of various soil-based fertilizers and 1.8 million jin of chemical fertilizers. In order to plant in a timely manner, the county meteorological station and the 16 newly built meteorological stations in various communes, along with more than 1,000 "weather observation groups," are paying attention to changes in climate and ground temperature. Gaotang County, striving to achieve the slogan of "Thousand-Jin Ginned Cotton County," is carrying out planting preparations with great enthusiasm.

    山东棉区大力准备春播
    本报济南24日电　山东著名的产棉区高唐、夏津、临清、高密等四个县、市，正在大力进行棉花春播的准备工作。
    去年这几个县、市的棉花都获得了空前丰收，临清市亩产皮棉一百五十五斤，高唐县亩产皮棉一百五十斤，夏津县一百三十斤，高密县一百斤。今年这几个县、市种棉都在五、六十万亩以上，高唐、夏津两县的增产指标都是平均亩产皮棉一千斤，临清市计划比去年增产一倍多，高密县也计划比去年增产将近一倍。现在，“雨水”已过，大地回春，这几个县市已经紧张地投入了播种准备工作。临清市组织了十五万人的棉花专业大军，培训了五万名合格的技术员，所有棉田已全部深翻一尺以上，其中三十五万亩平均每亩施底肥三十四万斤，计划在播种前每亩施足十万斤底肥。为了保墒，全市组织了七千五百犋牲口，将棉田普遍耙耢了三遍。去冬今春共灌棉田四十五万亩，计划“惊蛰”前全部灌一次水。棉种已备好二千七百万斤，工具、农药也作了准备。此外，全市已划好棉花丰产方二千五百多个，并结合划方，整好了大地畦田。
    夏津县除了完成深翻等播种准备工作外，开始棉花育苗。高密县现在已积造有机土肥料一百十四亿斤，备妥各种土化肥三千八百多万斤，化肥一百八十万斤；为了适时播种，县气象站及各公社新建的十六个气象站，一千多个“观天小组”，注意气候、地温的变化。高唐县在力争实现“千斤皮棉县”的口号下，播种准备工作正在热烈进行。
