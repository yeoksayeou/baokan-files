Visiting Yan'an Amidst the Great Leap Forward
By our reporters Feng Senling and Yuan Mu

    We arrived in Yan'an on the eve of the Spring Festival. On both banks of the Yan River flowing around the city, from dawn till sunset, there was not a single idler to be seen; at night, men, women, old and young were happily preparing to celebrate the Spring Festival, and the moving tunes of the Shaanxi Yangko were constantly coming from the cave dwellings on the hillside. The people of Yan'an, with their revolutionary tradition, are determined to double the county's grain output this year on the basis of doubling it last year, and to achieve a greater leap forward in industrial output on the basis of doubling it last year. People have rich experience from last year's Great Leap Forward, so this year they have even greater enthusiasm and are full of confidence.

    In these days, all the people of Yan'an are fighting feverishly for fertilizer. The day before we arrived in Yan'an was the second "assault day" for the whole city to engage in fertilizer accumulation. The Secretary of the Yan'an Prefectural Committee, the Commissioner, and all the cadres were holding shovels and hoes, accumulating fertilizer together with more than 10,000 people. The formerly quiet and deserted slopes and barren hills suddenly became lively. Some people were digging cellars, and some were transporting firewood. After a while, a cloud of thick smoke rose from the hillside, as the masses were making fertilizer on the spot. In the past, fertilizer was rarely applied to the mountainous areas of Yan'an. The mountains are high and the ravines are deep, and it is not easy to transport fertilizer to the mountains. This year, the people of Yan'an decided to apply 50,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. In addition to smoking fertilizer on the spot and applying it on the spot, they have also come up with many new transportation methods.

    When we went to Zaoyuan to pay our respects to Chairman Mao's former residence, we found that the road was not as dusty as ordinary roads in northern Shaanxi. It turned out that the members of the Zaoyuan Commune had swept the road from Yan'an to Zaoyuan four times while rushing to accumulate fertilizer before the Spring Festival. In Zaoyuan, the farmers, together with the teachers and students of the Northwest Agricultural College who had been sent down here, had successfully trial-produced a chemical fertilizer made of glass. It is said that applying one jin of this fertilizer per mu can maintain its effectiveness for four years.

    This year, Yan'an not only did a good job in accumulating fertilizer, but also started early and acted quickly in preparing for spring plowing. Chopping firewood is one of the important items in the preparation for spring plowing here. If firewood is not prepared in the winter of the previous year, it will affect the whole year's production in the second year. Many villages have organized large numbers of professional firewood chopping teams. People carry their bedding and set up stoves on the mountains, braving the biting cold wind to cut the firewood needed for the whole year. More than a month ago, various people's communes began to increase feed for livestock, and most of the livestock in the county were well fed. The whole county universally inspected the spring sowing seeds, not only ensuring that the quantity was sufficient, but also drying them.

    "You have grain cellars, I have autumn-plowed land," the farmers of Yan'an use these words to describe the importance of autumn plowing. On both banks of the Yan River, all the river land has been deeply plowed. In the Fengfu People's Commune in the mountainous area, although there was a shortage of labor, they still plowed all the commune's cultivated land once before the ground froze.

    Many barren hills surrounding Yan'an have now been covered with greenery. The seedlings planted by the representatives of the Five Provinces Youth Afforestation Conference in Yangjialing, where the CPC Central Committee was located in those years, have now grown up. Last winter, more than 1,000 citizens and government cadres in Yan'an City spent half a month building 318 mu of terraced fields on Qingliang Mountain, which was originally a barren mountain, completing 27 gully projects and 31 water cellars, planting 437 mu of fruit trees, other trees, and 93 mu of pasture, quickly giving the entire Qingliang Mountain a new look. In other mountainous areas of the county, the work of building terraced fields and straightening gullies has also been launched.

    The Loess Plateau of northern Shaanxi has little rainfall, which is a fatal injury to agricultural production. No wonder the people of Yan'an are so enthusiastic about water conservancy. Although the weather is cold and the ground is frozen, six large-scale water conservancy projects have been under construction in Yan'an County since last winter, and various communes are also building some small-scale water conservancy projects. When we visited the Baili Yanhui Canal construction site, which can irrigate more than 50,000 mu of land, a winter construction award ceremony was being held. Twenty-nine advanced units and one hundred and thirty-four model individuals were rewarded at the meeting. They were all heroes who had overcome difficulties. In the severe winter, when the ground was frozen a foot deep, the heroes overcame numerous difficulties, made their own explosives, and used large explosions to uncover the frozen soil. The canal filling required taking soil from 200 meters away, which was difficult to transport and had low work efficiency. The workers thought hard day and night and created the method of "ice road transportation of soil," which greatly improved the efficiency of soil transportation. This construction site also created an unprecedented record of filling an average of 10.07 cubic meters per person per day in winter construction.

    In recent years, the people of Yan'an have built 1,699 factories (including 23 county-run and 1,676 commune-run) for power generation, iron smelting, synthetic petroleum, cement, ceramics, flour, and chemical fertilizers. At the end of 1958, the county's industrial output value accounted for 37.2% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. This year, Yan'an Prefecture and Yan'an County have decided to continue to build and expand many factories in Yan'an for steelmaking, machinery, electricity, cement, nitrogen fertilizer, pesticides, wool weaving, and grain processing. Each commune and production team has a farm tool repair factory or repair station, a local chemical fertilizer factory, a pesticide factory, and a grain processing factory. In the Fengfu People's Commune, four coal kilns have been built, and the coal produced can not only supply the commune's iron smelting plant and the members' domestic coal, but also be sold externally.

    跃进声中访延安
    本报记者　冯森龄　袁木
    我们在春节前夕来到了延安。在绕城流过的延河两岸，从黎明直到日落，到处都看不到闲人；夜晚，男女老少都在愉快地准备欢渡春节，动人的陕北秧歌调不时从半山坡上的窑洞中传来。具有革命传统的延安人民，决心在去年全县粮食产量翻一番的基础上今年再翻一番，工业产量也要在去年增长两倍的基础上实现更大的跃进。人们有去年大跃进的丰富经验，因而今年有更大的干劲和充满了信心。
    在这些日子里，延安全体人民正在热火朝天地为肥料而战。我们到达延安的前一天，正是延安全城大搞积肥的第二个“突击日”。延安地委书记、专员和所有的干部，都拿着铁铲镢头，同一万多名群众一起积肥。过去冷冷静静的坡洼秃山，顿时热闹起来了。有的人挖地窖，有的人运柴草。一会儿山坡崖畔，升起一片浓烟，这是群众在就地造肥。延安山地过去很少施肥，山高沟深，有肥也不容易送上山。今年延安人民决定每亩地要施肥五万斤。他们除了就地熏肥、就地施用外，还想出了许多新的运输办法。
    当我们到枣园去瞻仰毛主席故居的路上，发现沿途不像陕北一般公路那样尘土飞扬，原来是枣园公社的社员们，在春节前突击积肥的时候，已经把从延安到枣园的公路清扫了四次。在枣园，农民们同下放到这里的西北农学院师生们一起，已经试制成功一种用玻璃做的化学肥料。据说，这种肥料每亩施一斤，肥效可以保持四年。
    今年延安不但积肥工作搞得好，春耕准备工作也动手早、行动快。砍柴是这里春耕准备工作重要项目之一，头年冬天不准备好烧柴，就会影响第二年全年的生产。许多村庄组织了大批砍柴专业队，人们背起铺盖，在山上搭起锅灶，冒着刺骨的寒风，砍下了全年所需要的烧柴。一个多月前，各个人民公社开始给家畜增加了饲料，全县大部分牲畜都喂得很好。春播种籽全县普遍进行了检查，不但数量足够，还进行了翻晒。
    “你有粮食窖，我有秋翻地”，延安农民用这样的话来形容秋翻地的重要性。在延河两岸，所有的川地全部深翻了。在山区的丰富人民公社，劳力虽然缺，但在封冻之前，还是把全公社的耕地翻了一遍。
    环绕延安的许多荒地秃山现在已经添上了绿装。1956年五省青年造林大会的代表们在当年中共中央所在地杨家岭种下的树苗，现在已经成长起来。去年冬天，延安市的一千多市民和机关干部，花了半个月的时间，在原来是童山秃岭的清凉山上，修下了三百十八亩水平梯田，完成了二十七处沟道工程和三十一个水窖，种植了四百三十七亩果树、其他树木和九十三亩牧草，迅速地使整个清凉山面貌一新。在全县其他山区也都展开了修水平梯田和整理沟壑的工作。
    陕北黄土高原雨量少，这是农业生产上的致命伤。难怪延安人民对兴修水利的劲头那么大。虽然天寒地冻，延安县从去冬以来有六个较大的水利工程在修建，各个公社还在兴修一些小型水利。我们访问可以灌溉五万多亩地的百里延惠渠工地的时候，那里正在举行冬季施工颁奖大会，会上有二十九个先进单位和一百三十四个模范人物受到奖励，他们都是战胜困难的英雄。严冬中地冻一尺，英雄们就克服重重困难，自己制造炸药，用大爆破的方法掀开冻土。渠道填方要从二百公尺以外的地方取土，运输困难，工效很低。民工们日夜苦思，创造了“冰道运土”的方法，使运土效率提高了好多倍。这个工地上还创造了在冬季施工，平均每人每日填方十点零七方的空前纪录。
    这几年来，延安人民建设了发电、炼铁、人造石油、水泥、陶瓷、面粉、化肥等一千六百九十九座工厂（其中县办的二十三个，社办的一千六百七十六个）。1958年底，全县的工业产值为工农业总产值的37.2％。今年，延安专区和延安县已经决定要继续在延安新建和扩建炼钢、机械、电、水泥、氮肥、农药、毛织、粮食加工等许多工厂，每个公社和生产队都有一个农具修配厂或修理站，有一座土化肥厂、农药厂和粮食加工厂。在丰富人民公社，已经办起了四座煤窑，出产的煤不仅可以供给公社炼铁厂和社员生活用煤，还可以外销。
