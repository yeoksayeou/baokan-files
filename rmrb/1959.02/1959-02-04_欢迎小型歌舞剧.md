　　Welcome Small-Scale Song and Dance Drama
　　Shandong Yantai  Shen Xinghe

    Recently, I have watched several programs in a row, including folk music accompaniment, folk song chorus, flower boat dance, lotus drop, pentatonic flat string, and song and dance drama. These programs are truly rich and colorful, exceptionally fresh and beautiful, like flowers blooming in a hundred-flower garden. Some are like peonies, some like roses, some like azaleas, and some like camellias and bamboos. … They all have their unique styles and forms, and they all have a strong sense of life and folk color. What I particularly love and cannot forget is the small-scale song and dance drama reflecting the life of the people's commune - "The People's Commune is Good." It sings the praises of the new people and new scenes of the people's commune with simple and beautiful folk melodies and Yangge forms. It vividly conveys the farmers' sincere feelings of love for the Party, love for Chairman Mao, and love for the people's commune. It can be said to be a rural lyrical poem combining song and dance. The song and dance drama has humorous dialogues and recitative narrations, all of which use the vivid lyrical language of the farmers. In the performance, it absorbs the movements of folk Yangge dance, creating light and graceful dance postures to show the labor scenes of drawing water, sowing, threshing, and harvesting. These dance postures that express labor are not mere simulations of labor movements, but rather elevated and beautified dance movements. All of this, poetry, music, and dance are organically combined to create a bright and cheerful comedic atmosphere in the song and dance drama. It truly reaches the so-called realm of "poetic and picturesque."
    We should warmly welcome this kind of art form, because it is lively and fresh, vivid and colorful, and it can flexibly reflect the new life, new things, new ideas, and new emotions of our jubilant and leaping era, so that the audience can get good artistic enjoyment and ideological education from it.

    欢迎小型歌舞剧
    山东烟台  沈星河
    最近，我连续看了几个节目，有民间乐曲伴奏、民歌合唱、花船舞、莲花落、五音平弹、歌舞剧等。这些节目真是丰富多彩，鲜美无比，宛如百花苑中盛开怒放的花朵。有的像牡丹，有的像玫瑰，有的像杜鹃，也有的像茶竹。……它们都各有独特的风格和形式，都各有强烈的生活气息和民间色彩。特别使我最喜爱，念念不忘的是反映人民公社生活的小型歌舞剧——“人民公社好”。它以朴素优美的民间乐调和秧歌形式，歌颂了人民公社的新人物新景象。生动的传达了农民热爱党、热爱毛主席、热爱人民公社的真挚的感情。可以说是一首歌与舞相结合的农村抒情诗。歌舞剧里有风趣的对白，也有朗诵的宣叙，这些都是采用了农民生动的抒情语言。在表演上吸收了民间秧歌舞的动作，作出轻盈优美的舞姿，表现了车水、播种、打谷、收割的劳动情景。这些表现劳动的舞姿，不是单纯劳动动作的模拟，而是提高了美化了的舞蹈动作。这一切，诗歌、音乐、舞蹈有机地结合在一起，造成了歌舞剧的明朗欢快的喜剧气氛。真是达到了所谓“诗情画意”的境地。
    我们应该热烈的欢迎这样的艺术形式，因为它活泼新鲜，有声有色，它并能机动灵活地反映我们欢腾跃进时代的新生活、新事物、新思想、新感情，使观众可以从中得到很好的艺术享受和思想教育。
