    As the sky was just beginning to lighten, and the northwest wind was blowing fiercely, a thin layer of ice had already formed on the river. At this time, in a fertilizer transport team in the First Production Area of the Chengguan Commune in Fengxian County, Jiangsu, there was a middle-aged man, around forty years old, full of energy, bending over and pulling a flatbed cart of fertilizer to the wheat fields. The cart was big and the road was uneven, making it quite difficult to pull. This person was none other than Comrade Kong Xianzhi, the First Secretary of the Fengxian County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
    Kong Xianzhi came here to participate in physical labor. As soon as he arrived, he lived in a commune member's home and ate at the canteen at the same table as the commune members. During breaks, he would hold the commune members' children and play with them, chatting and laughing with the commune members, asking about their lives. Therefore, he quickly became like family with the commune members, and anyone with "something on their mind" wanted to talk to him. A female commune member named Gu Fanshi often argued with her brother. One night, it was almost ten o'clock, and they started arguing again. Gu Fanshi ran to Kong Xianzhi's residence, wanting him to help her distinguish right from wrong. After she explained the reason, Kong Xianzhi carefully helped them solve the problem. Gu Fanshi said gratefully, "Thanks to the help of Comrade Lao Kong!"
    Kong Xianzhi's participation in labor production was down-to-earth. In the words of the commune members, "He's top-notch, a good example!" On his first day here, at his request, the team leader assigned him to the wheat professional team to carry diluted manure to water the wheat. At the time, some women grumbled, "He's the county party secretary, used to being clean. Can he carry those stinky urine and feces with us?" But Kong Xianzhi, from the moment he started doing this work, seemed to be fascinated by it. He didn't cover his nose or turn his face away, and he didn't mind even when urine and feces splashed on him. One day, when a woman was pouring urine and feces into a bucket, she accidentally splashed some on Kong Xianzhi. Her face immediately turned red, but Kong Xianzhi said with a smile, "It's nothing, if it gets dirty, just wash it off."
    When Kong Xianzhi worked, he always chose the heavy work. In the wheat top-dressing professional team, carrying two buckets of urine and feces to the wheat field two hundred meters away was quite tiring. Kong Xianzhi often held onto the carrying pole and carried four or five loads in a row. While working, he constantly helped the commune members find ways to improve their operating methods, such as using furrow irrigation with urine and manure water, which saved a lot of labor.
    Kong Xianzhi's laboring alongside the masses greatly encouraged their enthusiasm, and both the labor attendance rate and labor efficiency improved. Some women who used to arrive late and leave early now not only didn't arrive late, but also ran ahead. Wang Yumei, a high school graduate, said, "After graduating, I often thought about finding a job in the city and didn't feel at ease with agricultural production. Now that I see county-level cadres participating in labor just like the masses, I will definitely participate in labor in the countryside for a long time." (Li Jiemin) (with picture)

    劳动的能手　群众的朋友
    天刚蒙蒙亮，西北风刮得正紧，河里已结了一层薄冰。这时在江苏丰县城关公社第一生产区的一个运肥队里，有一个四十岁上下、精神饱满的中年人，正躬着身子使劲拉着一平车肥料向麦田里送。车头大，路不平，拉车子实在有些吃力。这个人，就是中共丰县县委第一书记孔宪质同志。
    孔宪质是到这里参加体力劳动的。他一来到就住在社员家里，到食堂和社员同桌吃饭。休息时抱着社员的小孩逗着玩，和社员谈笑风生，问长问短，因此，很快就和社员搞得像一家人似的，谁有啥“心事话”，都想找他谈谈。一个叫谷范氏的女社员，和胞兄常常闹气，一天晚上快十点钟了，又闹了起来，谷范氏跑到孔宪质的住处，要他帮她分清是非。当她说明原因后，孔宪质细心的帮助她（他）们解决了问题。谷范氏感激地说：“多亏了老孔同志的帮助！”
    孔宪质参加劳动生产是踏踏实实的，用社员的话来说：“是顶呱呱的，好样的！”在他来到这里的第一天，根据他的请求，队长分配他到小麦专业队里抬稀粪尿浇麦。当时有些妇女叽叽咕咕地说：“人家是县委书记，干净惯了的，能和我们一起抬那些臭气熏人的尿粪吗？”可是孔宪质，一开始干这个活，就像入迷似地爱上了它。既不捂鼻子，也不扭脸，有时尿粪溅在身上，也不介意。一天，一个妇女向桶里灌尿粪时，一不小心，尿粪溅到孔宪质身上，她马上脸红了，孔宪质却笑着说：“这没啥，弄脏了，洗洗就行了。”
    孔宪质干起活来，还尽拣重活干。在小麦追肥专业队里，挑两桶尿粪送到二百公尺以外的麦田里，是比较吃力的，孔宪质常常抓住担子不放，一连就挑四、五担。他在干活时，不断帮助社员找窍门改进操作方法，如用开垅沟灌溉尿粪水的办法，节省了很多劳动力。
    孔宪质和群众一起劳动，大大鼓舞了群众的干劲，劳动出勤率和劳动效率都有了提高。原来一些好迟到早退的妇女，现在，不但不迟到，而且跑在头里。高小毕业生王玉梅说：“我毕业后常想到城市里找工作，不安心农业生产，现在看到县里干部都和群众一样的参加劳动，我也一定长期在农村参加劳动。”（李洁民）（附图片）
