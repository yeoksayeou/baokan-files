Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 21st: The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to organize a ten-thousand-strong inspection team to immediately go deep into the industrial, transportation, and capital construction fronts to promote a production upsurge, in order to guarantee the fulfillment and overfulfillment of the first quarter's production tasks, and to lay a good foundation for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. Eight groups, composed of more than 180 cadres drawn from various provincial departments and bureaus, were dispatched on the 18th to various special districts, autonomous prefectures, and the Sichuan-Guizhou and Yunnan-Guizhou railways.

This large-scale inspection team is headed by Zhao Yuqiao, a member of the Standing Committee of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, with one to two responsible cadres from each provincial department and bureau also participating. The content of this inspection includes: the situation of various regions promoting enthusiasm and launching upsurges and carrying out socialist emulation; the situation of various regions formulating leap forward plans and specific measures to ensure the realization of the plans; the implementation and experience of "secretary taking the lead," "two participations, one transformation, and three combinations"; the situation of vigorously carrying out technical innovation and production plan completion, etc. The inspection will last approximately one month.

During the inspection, all regions will adopt a method of combining key inspections with general inspections, and will also conduct propaganda while inspecting, resolving problems in a timely manner after they are discovered. For those regions and units that have not yet launched mass movements and production upsurges, they will be assisted in mobilizing the masses and immediately launching the movement. For those units that have already formed a movement and are completing production plans relatively well, they will be helped to summarize experiences, promote them in a timely manner, and further guide the movement in depth.

    万人检查团深入现场
    协助企业大搞群众运动
    贵州
    新华社贵阳21日电　中共贵州省委决定组织一个万人检查团，立即深入工业、交通和基本建设战线促进生产高潮，以保证完成和超额完成第一季度生产任务，为今年更大更好更全面的跃进打下良好基础。由省属各厅、局抽调一百八十多名干部组成的八个组，已经在18日分赴各专区、自治州和川黔、滇黔两条铁路线。
    这个规模巨大的检查团，由中共贵州省委常委赵欲樵担任团长，省各厅、局也抽调了一至二名负责干部参加。这次检查的内容有：各地鼓干劲搞高潮和开展社会主义竞赛的情况；各地制订跃进计划和保证实现计划的具体措施的情况；书记挂帅，“两参一改三结合”的执行情况和经验；大搞技术革新和生产计划完成情况等。检查的时间约一个月左右。
    各地在检查中，都将采取重点检查和一般检查相结合的方法，并且要边检查、边宣传，发现问题以后要及时解决。对于那些还没有掀起群众运动和生产高潮的地区和单位，要协助他们发动群众，把运动立即掀起来；对于已经形成运动、生产计划又完成较好的单位，要帮助他们总结经验，及时推广，并且进一步把运动导向深入。
