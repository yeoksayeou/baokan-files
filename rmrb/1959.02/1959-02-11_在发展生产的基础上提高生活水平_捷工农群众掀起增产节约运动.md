Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 9th: The nationwide discussion of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee's letter to all working people on the issue of raising people's living standards has now basically concluded. More than three million workers and peasants nationwide (approximately one-quarter of the country's total population) participated in discussions at various gatherings. They put forward hundreds of thousands of constructive opinions and suggestions, and passed numerous resolutions and pledges.

This discussion began in late November of last year and lasted for approximately two months. The discussion shows that the vast majority of the working people of Czechoslovakia correctly understand the significance of the issue of raising people's living standards raised by the Party Central Committee. In their speeches, they pointed out that living standards can only be guaranteed on the basis of developing production. Therefore, with the attitude of masters of the country, they proactively put forward various suggestions for increasing production and improving labor productivity, setting off a new high tide of the movement to increase production and practice economy throughout the country.

Taking the Prague region as an example, the working people of the entire region put forward approximately 50,000 suggestions, and more than 200 factories and enterprises put forward pledges for the entire factory or enterprise regarding increased production in the first quarter. Employees in the machine-building industry decided in the discussion to produce an additional 200 million crowns (Czech currency) worth of products this year. The Kladno United Iron and Steel Plant pledged to overfulfill the plan for the first quarter by producing 240 tons of pig iron and 1,380 tons of steel. In addition to increasing production and practicing economy, the workers' pledges also included improving technology, raising quotas, and striving for the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team."

After discussions, agricultural cooperative members also expressed their ardent support for the policies of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, especially their heartfelt support for the Czechoslovak Communist Party's measures to raise living standards, by establishing and expanding agricultural cooperatives and making practical guarantees for improving agricultural production.

The discussion further deepened the broad masses' love for the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Recently, a large number of urban and rural working people have been accepted into the Communist Party.

The great significance of this discussion is not only reflected in raising the political and production enthusiasm of the working people, but also in educating Party, trade union organizations, and economic organs at all levels on how to mobilize the broad masses of workers to participate in solving major national issues. Many of the suggestions made by the masses in the discussion have been put into practice, and all opinions have been promptly responded to. The Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee will hold a meeting in February to comprehensively summarize this discussion and formulate specific measures to improve people's living standards based on the opinions put forward by the working people.

    在发展生产的基础上提高生活水平
    捷工农群众掀起增产节约运动
    新华社布拉格9日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会关于提高人民生活水平问题告全体劳动人民书的全民讨论现在已经基本结束。在全国有三百多万工农群众（约占全国总人口的四分之一）参加了各种集会的讨论。他们提出了数十万条建设性的意见和建议，并且通过了大量的决议和提出许多保证。
    这次讨论是从去年11月下旬开始的，持续了约两个月。讨论的情况表明，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民绝大多数能够正确地理解党中央提出的提高人民生活水平问题的意义。他们在发言中指出了只有在发展生产的基础上才能够保证生活水平的提高。因此他们以国家主人翁的态度主动地提出了各种增加生产和提高劳动生产率的建议，在全国范围内掀起了一个新的增产节约运动高潮。
    以布拉格州为例，全州劳动人民提出了约五万条建议，并且有二百多个工厂、企业提出了全厂或全企业关于第一季度的增产保证。机器制造业的职工在讨论中决定在今年内多生产价值二亿克朗（捷币）的产品。克拉德诺的联合钢铁厂保证第一季度超计划生产二百四十吨生铁和一千三百八十吨钢材。工人们的保证除增产节约外，还包括提高技术、提高定额和争取“社会主义劳动队”的光荣称号等内容。
    农业合作社员们经过讨论后也以建立和扩大农业合作社以及提高农业生产的实际保证来表明对捷克斯洛伐克共产党的政策的热烈支持，特别是对捷共提高生活水平措施的衷心拥护。
    讨论也进一步加深了广大群众对捷共的爱戴。在最近期间，有大批城乡劳动人民被接受加入共产党。
    这次讨论的重大意义不仅表现在提高了劳动人民的政治和生产积极性，而且也教育了各级党、工会组织和经济机关怎样动员广大劳动者来参与国家重大问题的解决。群众在讨论中提出的建议很多已付诸实行，所有意见都迅速地得到了答复。捷共中央将在2月份开会全面总结这一讨论，并根据劳动人民提出的意见具体制订提高人民生活水平的措施。
