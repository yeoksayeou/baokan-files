From Focusing on Exploration to Emphasizing Both Exploration and Production
Qaidam Basin Unveils a New Chapter
(Our dispatch from Da Qaidan, February 1st) Eighteen thousand heroes are demonstrating their skills in the treasure basin of the motherland, the Qaidam Basin, resulting in a comprehensive bumper harvest in geological exploration, local industry, and agriculture in a short period. In 1959, the work in the basin will transition from a long-term focus on exploration to a new stage emphasizing both exploration and production.

Geological exploration, centered on finding oil, achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in 1958: two high-yield large oil fields and three high-yield large gas fields were found in the four major oil exploration areas. Based on work in previous years, eight oil fields were confirmed to have industrial value. A large recoverable reserve was obtained from exploring a small portion of the area on several oil-bearing structures. The reserves explored on several structures in the Lenghu and Yushashan exploration areas have more oil per square kilometer than Karamay. Explorers said they finally caught the "big fish" after casting their nets everywhere. The future work is to concentrate efforts on attacking the large oil fields that have already been found, and strive to determine their area and reserves in the shortest possible time.

On the edge of the Qaidam Basin, more than 3,000 professional geologists worked with the masses of factories, mines, farms, and pastures last year, going deep into the Kunlun Mountains, the Altun Mountains, and the Qilian Mountains to find treasures. A total of more than 40 kinds of minerals, and more than 220 mineral deposits and mineral occurrences were found. Many places where no one had ever been before now have small flags marking mineral occurrences. Among them, there are twelve large deposits, all with high grades, including both the main raw materials for industrial production, as well as fuels and auxiliary materials. These further prove that the resources of Qaidam are abundant, rich, and complete, meeting the requirements of industrial production.

The flowers of local industry have just begun to bloom. More than 60 factories and mines were built in one year, with a total output value equivalent to more than 30 times the state investment. Products such as lead-zinc ore, borax, potash fertilizer, asbestos, and crystal are of good quality. These factories and mines were all built in the spirit of diligence and thrift, and the principles of "using indigenous methods, making do with whatever is available, and relying on our own efforts." For example, the Xitieshan lead-zinc mine was just a team of more than 20 people picking up ore dug out by explorers at the beginning of last year, and by the end of the year it had developed into a mining team of 1,600 people, mining 100,000 tons of ore for the country in one year. Local industry has started from scratch and begun to change the situation of "only imports and no exports" in the Qaidam Basin. Qaidam is beginning to supply its treasures to other places.

The agricultural reclamation cause is also closely following up. Seventeen farms planted more than 260,000 mu last year, producing 90 million jin of grain, which is more than enough to be self-sufficient for the original population of the basin last spring. The Saishike Farm on the eastern edge of the basin created the highest wheat yield record in the country in 1958. The largest farm in the basin, Delingha Farm, had an average yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu on 14,000 mu of wheat, earning the glorious title of "Qaidam Granary." The agricultural reclamation cause in Qaidam has only five years of history. There is a lot of arable land here, with long sunshine hours, abundant natural fertilizer, and sufficient snowmelt and underground spring water. The agricultural reclamation cause has great potential.

1958 was the fastest year of development in the Qaidam Basin in several years. In this year, about 100,000 people came here from more than 20 provinces, more than doubling the population of the basin. Under the leadership of the Party, they are proud to develop and build this virgin land of the motherland. With their hard work and wisdom, they are painting the newest and most beautiful picture on this blank sheet of paper in Qaidam.

This year, the scale of exploration in the basin will be further expanded, there will be more crude oil production, refineries, steel plants, lead-zinc smelters, borax plants, fertilizer plants, and many small and medium-sized factories and mines will make the basin more beautiful, and agriculture and animal husbandry will also be greatly developed. The day when Qaidam, a veritable treasure basin, will contribute a large amount of treasure to the socialist construction of the motherland is getting closer and closer.

    从以勘探为主进到勘探和生产并重
    柴达木揭开新的一页
    本报大柴旦1日电　十八万健儿在祖国的聚宝盆柴达木盆地大显身手，使得地质勘探、地方工业和农业在短期内获得了全面的丰收，1959年，盆地工作将由长期以勘探为主进入勘探和生产并重的新阶段。
    以找石油为中心的地质勘探在1958年中获得空前丰收：在四大石油探区找到了两个高产大油田，三个高产大气田，并在前几年工作的基础上证实了八个油田具有工业价值。在几个储油构造上探明的一小部分面积，就获得了很大的可采储量。在冷湖和油砂山探区的几个构造上探明的储量，每平方公里含油比克拉玛依的还多。勘探人员说，到处撒网，终于把“大鱼”网住了。今后的工作就是集中力量猛攻已经找到的大油田，争取在最短期间探明其面积和储量。
    在柴达木的边沿，去年有三千多名专业地质人员同各厂矿农牧场的群众结合，深入昆仑山、阿尔金山、祁连山找宝，共找到了四十多个矿种，二百二十多个矿床和矿点。许多从来没有人迹的地方，现在已经插上矿点标志的小旗了。其中大矿床有十二个，品位都很高，既有工业生产上的主要原料，又有燃料和辅助原料。这些都进一步证明柴达木的资源是又多、又富、又全，符合工业生产要求的条件。
    地方工业的花朵初开，一年中建起了六十多座厂矿，总产值相当于国家投资的三十多倍。产品如铅锌矿、硼砂、钾肥、石棉、水晶等质量很好。这些厂矿都是本着勤俭办企业的精神和“土法上马、因陋就简、自力更生”原则办起来的。如锡铁山铅锌矿，去年年初还只是二十多个人在拣拾勘探人员挖出来的矿石，年底就发展成一千六百人的采矿队，一年中为国家开采了十万吨矿石。地方工业从无到有，开始改变了柴达木盆地物资“有进无出”的局面，柴达木开始以它的部分宝藏供应外地。
    农垦事业也紧紧跟上。十七个农场去年播种了二十六万多亩，生产粮食九千万斤，在去春盆地原有人口的数字上自给有余。盆地东沿的赛什克农场，创造了1958年全国小麦高产最高纪录。盆地最大的德令哈农场有一万四千亩小麦平均亩产一千斤以上，获得了“柴达木粮仓”的光荣称号。柴达木的农垦事业只有五年历史，这里可垦荒地很多，日照长，自然肥丰富，雪水和地下泉水也充足，农垦事业大有可为。
    1958年是柴达木盆地几年发展最快的一年。在这一年里，约有十万人从二十多个省来到这里，使盆地人口增加了一倍多。他们在党的领导下，以开发和建设祖国这块处女地为荣。他们以自己的辛勤劳动和智慧，正在柴达木这张白纸上画着最新最美的图。
    今年，盆地的勘探规模将更加扩大，原油将有更多的生产，炼油厂、钢铁厂、铅锌冶炼厂、硼砂厂、化肥厂和许多中小型厂矿将使盆地更加美丽，农牧业也将大大发展。柴达木这个名符其实的聚宝盆，为祖国社会主义建设大量献宝的日子越来越近了。
