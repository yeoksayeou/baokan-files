The Wuchang County in Heilongjiang Province used 1,200 capstan power machines (power machinery made based on the principle of rope traction machines) and saved more than 200,000 labor days in two months. This achievement once again proves that tool reform is the most important way to solve the problem of labor shortage.

Any new thing will encounter many difficulties when it first appears; however, no matter how young it is, it will always overcome all difficulties and grow up. When the rope traction machine first appeared, in some places, because its performance was not mastered, there were shortcomings in manufacturing, and it was not familiar in use, some people tried it and thought it was "not easy to use" and put it aside. However, if it is treated with the correct attitude, its role can be fully utilized, not only to help people complete the task of deep plowing, but also to participate in other field operations. Wuchang County has used this machine to do 30 kinds of work. This fact is a powerful answer to those who still doubt the value of rope traction machines.

From the process of popularizing the capstan power machine in Wuchang County, we can see the dialectical relationship between the popularization and improvement of a new tool. Undoubtedly, popularization is the main thing at this stage; however, there is also improvement in popularization. The capstan power machines manufactured and used in Wuchang County are simple in structure, easily manufactured, and driven by manpower or animal power, with low cost, but the actual efficiency is very high. Using this capstan power machine is many times more efficient than simple manual labor. This is the significance of popularizing this semi-mechanized tool. Some people only think about "improvement." They look down on this simple rope traction machine driven by manpower or animal power. It seems that only modern machines driven by motors or internal combustion engines are satisfying. Some people see that a new tool can improve labor efficiency, but there are still some shortcomings, so they are unwilling to promote it, and want to wait until it is perfect before promoting it. This is not understanding the relationship between popularization and improvement. This kind of thinking not only hinders the popularization of semi-mechanized new tools, but also is not conducive to the improvement of new tools.

On the road to agricultural mechanization, today popularization is the main thing; however, improvement is also included in popularization. A newly emerging tool, in the process of popularization, that is, in the process of extensive practice, there will always be improvements, whether large or small, more or less. Because the promotion and popularization of any advanced tool will first arouse people's attention to the technical knowledge related to it and inspire the wisdom of the masses. Conversely, with the improvement of the technical level of the masses, they will continue to conceive of improving this new tool to make it more efficient and more versatile. In this way, the new tool among the masses is not just imitating, but becoming more and more sophisticated and more and more applicable. For example, the Shuangxing People's Commune in Wuchang County added self-made ball bearings to the capstan power machine, so that the power machine that could only do one job before can now drive four tools at the same time: cutting grass, milling rice, blowing air, and weaving straw ropes. Although this capstan power machine still has not exceeded the scope of being powered by manpower or animal power, it has been improved in terms of its comprehensive utilization efficiency.

Any new tool always has to go through a process of becoming refined from rough, gradually improving, and gradually improving. If, in the process of promotion, the leadership can consciously inspire and absorb the wisdom of the masses, and actively guide and support the masses to improve tools, then this improvement will be faster, greater, and more. This is the case in Wuchang County. In the process of promoting the capstan power machine, mobilizing the masses to contribute ideas and suggestions can quickly turn inefficient machines into more efficient machines, and quickly turn machines with only one or two uses into machines with multiple uses. If we do not strive for popularization, it will be difficult to improve quickly.

Of course, the improvement currently mentioned mostly refers to the improvement at the level of semi-mechanization, and it is impossible to improve to complete mechanization and electrification for a while. However, this improvement in the process of popularization is not unrelated to the future complete mechanization and electrification. Complete mechanization and electrification mainly involve fundamental changes in the power part; the transmission device, speed change device, and working machinery can be continuously improved and improved in the current process of promoting the capstan power machine, and can be familiarized and mastered by the broad masses. The more popularization work and improvement work done on the basis of popularization today, the smoother the realization of mechanization and electrification in the future. In other words, today's small improvement is preparing the foundation for tomorrow's big improvement.

    新工具的普及和提高
    程浦
    黑龙江省五常县使用了一千二百部绞关动力机（根据绳索牵引机原理制成的动力机械），在两个月里就节省了二十多万个劳动日。这个成就，再一次证明了工具改革是解决劳动力不足问题的最重要的途径。
    任何新事物初露面的时候，总要碰到许多困难；但是，不管它是多么幼小，它总是要战胜一切困难生长起来。绳索牵引机最初出现的时候，在有些地方，因为没有掌握住它的性能，在制造上有缺点，在使用上不熟悉，有些人试验了一下就认为“不好使”，把它放在一边了。可是，如果用正确的态度对待它，就可充分发挥它的作用，不但帮助人们完成深耕的任务，还可以参加别的田间作业。五常县利用这种机械做的工作，已经有三十项。这个事实对于那些至今仍然怀疑绳索牵引机的价值的人们，是一个有力的回答。
    从五常县推广绞关动力机的过程中，可以看出一种新工具的普及和提高的辩证关系。毫无疑问，在现阶段普及是主要的；但是，在普及之中也就有了提高。五常县制造和使用的绞关动力机都是构造简单、由人力或畜力带动的容易制造，成本低廉，但实际效能却很大，使用这种绞关动力机比单纯的手工劳动效率要高好多倍。这就是普及这种半机械化的工具的意义所在。有些人只想着要“提高”，他们看不起这种由人力或畜力带动的简易的绳索牵引机，似乎只有使用电动机或内燃机带动的现代化机器才过瘾。有些人看到一种新工具虽然能提高劳动效率，但还有些缺点，就不愿推广，而要等到它十全十美了才推广。这是不懂得普及和提高的关系。这种思想不但妨碍半机械化的新工具的普及，同时也不利于新工具的提高。
    在农业机械化的道路上，今天是普及为主；但是，在普及中也就包含有提高的因素。一种新出现的工具，在普及的过程中，也就是说在广泛实践的过程中，总会有或大或小或多或少的改进。因为任何一种先进工具的推广和普及，首先会引起人们对于跟它有关的技术知识的注意，启发群众的智慧。反过来，随着群众的技术水平的提高，他们也就会不断设想来改善这种新工具，使它效能更大、用途更广。这样，新工具在群众中，就不是依样画葫芦，而是越来越精巧，越来越适用。例如五常县双兴人民公社给绞关动力机加上自造的滚珠轴承，使原先只能做一种工作的动力机，现在带动铡草、碾米、鼓风、编草绳四种工具同时工作。虽然这种绞关动力机仍然没有越出由人力或畜力发动的范围，但从它的综合利用的效能来说，已经是提高了。
    任何一种新工具，总是要经过由粗而精、逐渐改善、逐步提高的过程。如果在推广的过程中，领导方面能够有意识地启发和吸取群众的智慧，积极引导和支持群众改善工具，那么，这种提高就会更快些、更大些、更多些。五常县的情形就是这样。在推广绞关动力机当中，发动群众献计献策，就能把效能不高的机械较快地变成效能较高的机械，把只有一两种用途的机械较快地变成有多种用途的机械。如果不力求普及，也就难以较快地提高。
    当然，目前所说的提高，大多数的情况还只是指在半机械化水平上的提高，一时还不可能提高到完全的机械化、电气化。但是，这种普及过程中的提高，跟将来的完全机械化、电气化的那种提高，并不是毫无联系的。完全的机械化、电气化，主要是动力部分有根本的改变；传动装置、变速装置和作业机械，在目前推广绞关动力机的过程中就可以不断改进、提高，可以为广大群众所熟悉、掌握。今天的普及工作和在普及的基础上所做的提高工作越多，将来机械化、电气化的实现就越顺利。也就是说，今日的小提高是为明日的大提高准备基础。
