People often say: the ocean cannot be measured with a dipper. Probably no artist can comprehensively and accurately depict the image of the great Lenin in an article. Therefore, articles that recall or narrate this great figure from their respective perspectives are very necessary and therefore very touching. "Reminiscences of Lenin" is such a collection of essays, each of which is like a fragment, but when you read it from beginning to end, a lively Lenin will appear in your mind. ...

Readers can learn a lot from these many memories. Take Lenin's treatment of comrades, for example, you can find many interesting and thought-provoking stories in this collection. Plekhanov's nephew, Semashko, recalled that Chicherin, who was then the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, had a habit of holding meetings after 12 o'clock at night and continuing until four or five o'clock in the morning. When Lenin learned about it, he asked Semashko to tell Chicherin: "Why torture yourself and others at the same time?" Semashko went to Chicherin and told him a simple truth: you must sleep at night and work during the day. Chicherin, however, quoted extensively, even citing a newly published biology book to prove that since roosters can crow at night, people should sleep during the day, because no one disturbs them at night, which is suitable for work. In any case, Semashko could not convince Chicherin... In the end? In the end, Lenin had to bring it to the Central Committee of the Party and made a decision to prohibit Chicherin from holding meetings after one o'clock at night.

But what about Lenin himself? Lenin himself worked tirelessly. According to Fotieva in the article "How Lenin Worked," Lenin never wasted a minute. He was not only good at cherishing his own time, but also good at cherishing the time of others. He was never late for meetings. According to Lenin's opinion, those who were late for meetings should be recorded, and like elementary school students, their names should be recorded for being a few minutes late, and repeat offenders should be punished. "Every morning, he would come to the office at a certain time, read many newspapers and documents, instruct the secretary to handle various matters, receive comrades, and preside over meetings, and often go home for lunch at exactly four o'clock. After lunch, he would rest for a while, and at six o'clock, he would come back with many slips of paper written in a notebook – orders to the secretary – he was always full of energy and enthusiasm, and often worked until late at night."

Lenin's concern for others was boundless. He often ordered people to take care of a certain comrade, "to ensure food, firewood, clothing, medical care, necessary rest, etc." Lenin wrote a short note to the then-sick People's Commissar for Food, Tsyurupa: "Your attitude towards state property is simply unacceptable." The "state property" referred to here is Tsyurupa's health.

The same recollection mentioned that Lenin was always full of energy and enthusiasm. Semashko also said that Lenin "although he had strong revolutionary enthusiasm, he was a rare person who was highly focused, clear-headed, and mentally concentrated."

Lenin always approached people like an ordinary worker, but he was also strict and very stern. One recollection said that Lenin was good at correctly evaluating each person, placing him in the appropriate position, and teaching him how to carry out each task to a successful conclusion, so everyone who approached Lenin felt that his work was necessary, and therefore he was also full of enthusiasm.

The old Bolshevik Andreyev said that although Lenin was very strict, he never lost his temper with people and never insulted people. This memoir said that the meetings presided over by Lenin were always very "harmonious and free," and "no one felt nervous" – that kind of arrogant and self-righteous bad temper could not be found in Lenin. At the meetings presided over by Lenin, everyone said whatever came to mind, "because they knew that Lenin would not rudely stop them." Anyone could argue with Lenin completely freely on any issue, "and in fact such arguments did occur." Most importantly, "he never thought that his own opinions could not be refuted, and always paid close attention to listening to other people's statements."

This great and ordinary teacher of laborers is so amiable that it is no wonder that everyone who had contact with him (not to mention those who worked under his leadership) left a deep impression and received a great education. All of this will be deeply felt after reading "Reminiscences of Lenin."

    平凡而可亲

    人们常说：大海是不能用斗来量的。恐怕没有一个艺术家能够在一篇文章里全面而准确地描绘出伟大列宁的形象来。因此，从各自的角度回忆或者记叙这个伟大人物的文章，就十分需要，因而也十分打动人了。“回忆列宁”就是这样的一本文集，每一篇都仿佛是一个片断，但是当你从头到尾读完了，你的脑海里会出现一个生龙活虎般的列宁。……
    读者可以从这许多回忆里学习到很多东西。就拿列宁对待同志这一点来说吧，就可以在这集子中找到许多有趣同时发人深省的故事。普列哈诺夫的侄儿谢马什科回忆说：当时担任外交人民委员的齐切林有这样的一个习惯，往往在夜里十二点钟以后开会，一直开到四五点钟。列宁知道了，便要谢马什科转告齐切林：“为什么要摧残自己，同时还要摧残别人？”谢马什科这样就到齐切林那里去，告诉他一个简单的真理：夜里必须睡眠，而白天要工作。齐切林却旁征博引地甚至引用了刚刚出版的一本生物学书籍来证明，既然雄鸡可以在夜里叫，那么人也应该在白天睡眠，因为夜里没有人打扰才适合工作。无论如何，谢马什科说不服齐切林……最后呢？最后只好由列宁提到党中央，作了禁止齐切林夜里一点以后开会的决定。
    但是列宁本人呢？列宁本人却是不知疲倦地工作的。据佛齐耶娃在“列宁是怎样工作的”一文所说，列宁从来没有浪费过一分钟，他不仅善于爱惜自己的时间，而且也善于珍惜别人的时间。开会是从不迟到的，凡是开会迟到的人，按照列宁的意见，都要记录下来，并且要像小学生似的记名迟到几分钟，屡犯者要加处分。“每天早晨他都是在一定的时间内来到办公室，阅读许多报纸和公文，吩咐秘书办理各项事情，接见同志，主持会议，常常都是准四点钟回家吃午饭。吃完午饭，稍稍休息一会，到六点钟的时候他带着用笔记本的纸页写的许多字条——对秘书的命令——回来了，他随时都是精神饱满、热情充沛的，经常工作到深夜为止。”
    列宁关怀别人却是无以复加的。他常常命令人们照顾某一位同志，“保证饮食、木柴、衣服、医疗、必要的休息等等”。列宁写给当时患病的粮食人民委员丘鲁巴的短简说：“你对国家财产的态度简直到了不可容许的地步。”这里所说的“国家财产”就是指丘鲁巴的健康。
    同一篇回忆谈到，列宁任何时候都是精神饱满、热情洋溢的。谢马什科也说，列宁“虽然有强烈的革命热情，却是一位罕见的聚精会神、思想清醒、精神集中的人。”
    列宁任何时候像一个普通劳动者那样去接近人，却又是要求严格、十分严厉的。有一篇回忆说：列宁善于正确地估价每一个人，将他放到适当的位置上，并且教导他如何把每一件工作进行到有结果为止，因此每一个接近列宁的人，都感觉到自己的工作是必要的，因而也是热情洋溢的。
  老布尔什维克安德烈耶夫说，列宁虽然很严厉，但是他从来不对人动气，从来不肯侮辱人的。这部回忆录说，列宁主持的会议，总是十分“融洽和自由”的，“没有人感到紧张”——那种盛气凌人，自以为是的坏脾气在列宁身上是找不到的。在列宁主持的会议上，每一个人都是想到什么就说什么，“因为知道列宁是不会粗暴地加以制止的。”谁也可以同列宁完全自由地争论任何问题，“并且事实上也发生过这样的争论。”最重要的，“他从来不认为自己的意见不能反驳，总是很注意倾听别人的陈述。”
    这个伟大而平凡的劳动者的导师是这么可亲，难怪所有和他接触过（还不必说在他领导下工作过）的人，都留下了深刻的印象，受到了很大的教育。这一切读了“回忆列宁”，就会深深地感觉到的。
