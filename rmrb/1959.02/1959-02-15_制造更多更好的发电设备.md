    Manufacture More and Better Power Generation Equipment

    China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry experienced tremendous development during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Compared to 1957, the total output value of China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry and the output of major electrical products such as electric motors, transformers, high-voltage switches, and electric wires and cables more than doubled in 1958. The output of power generation equipment increased sharply by more than threefold, from less than 200,000 kilowatts in 1957 to more than 900,000 kilowatts in 1958, which is equivalent to twice the total output during the First Five-Year Plan period. Electrical machinery manufacturing technology has also been greatly improved, and many major new products were born this year. These include a 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator set, a 72,500-kilowatt hydro-generator, a high-pressure boiler with an evaporation capacity of 230 tons per hour, a 220,000-volt high-voltage cable, and a 138-ton AC trunk line electric locomotive, among others. The production of these new products marks a great leap forward for China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry towards the world's advanced technological levels.

    The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out that 1959 is a decisive year for our country's three years of hard struggle, and a greater leap forward than in 1958 will be achieved. In order to meet the growing need for electricity from various sectors of the national economy, the electrical machinery manufacturing industry must also achieve a greater leap forward in 1959. According to preliminary calculations, the production of power generation equipment in 1959 will greatly exceed that in 1958. Its development speed will not only be unprecedented in the electrical machinery manufacturing industry, but also the most prominent among the leap forward targets of China's national economy in 1959. All employees of the electrical machinery manufacturing industry must go all out, aim high, and resolutely complete the glorious and arduous tasks of 1959.

    In order to successfully complete the task of electrical machinery manufacturing in 1959, the most important thing is to do everything possible to expand production capacity. Compared with the annual task, the current production capacity of electrical machinery manufacturing is still far behind. This requires existing enterprises, especially large enterprises with a good foundation, to fully utilize their production potential. In these enterprises, we should continue to oppose conservatism, vigorously promote mass movements, and actively take concrete measures to bravely undertake 70% of the manufacturing task of power generation equipment. Is this possible? The answer is yes. For example, the Harbin Electrical Machinery Factory, which is equipped with modern equipment, produced 210,000 kilowatts of power generation equipment in the first three quarters of last year, but in the fourth quarter, due to the strengthening of leadership and the mobilization of the masses, the output in one quarter exceeded the total of the previous three quarters; the 72,500-kilowatt hydro-generator, which was originally scheduled to be trial-produced this year, was also successfully trial-produced before the end of last year. This proves that relying on "large foreign groups," increasing "output per unit area," and striving for "large-scale harvests" are not only possible, but also the fastest and most effective ways to expand production capacity. At the same time, we should continue to adopt the method of small local groups to manufacture small and simple power generation equipment. Last year, a large number of small power stations were built in rural areas using local methods. According to incomplete statistics, the total capacity is over 100,000 kilowatts. Although the main force of electrical machinery manufacturing is "large foreign groups," and high-temperature, high-pressure, high-speed, and large-capacity products need to be trial-produced and produced by large enterprises, the strength of "small local groups" should never be underestimated. In electrical machinery manufacturing, we must resolutely implement the policy of focusing on large-scale enterprises and combining large, medium, and small enterprises to meet the needs of industrial development.

    Another important aspect of expanding the capacity of electrical machinery manufacturing is to seize the construction of new and expanded enterprises and strive to complete and put them into production as soon as possible. Because more than half of this year's electrical machinery production tasks need to be undertaken by these new enterprises, building a factory sooner means increasing strength sooner. Therefore, when arranging basic construction projects, we must adhere to the spirit of ensuring key projects and making overall arrangements. The finishing work of expansion projects and new factories that have already started construction should be expedited to put them into production and play a role as soon as possible. At the same time, under unified planning, all departments that can manufacture electrical products, especially departments that use electrical products, such as automobile factories and machine tool factories, should also increase the number of electrical workshops as much as possible, under the premise of ensuring the completion of their original production tasks, and manufacture some of the electrical collaborative products they need. The machine repair forces of non-mechanical departments should also undertake part of the electrical product manufacturing tasks within their capabilities. The power station repair departments have a good foundation and strong technical force, and they are an indispensable force. The participation of user departments in manufacturing not only solves some of their own problems, but also provides favorable conditions for further improving the structure and performance of products. No matter which aspect of the force, especially the large electrical machinery enterprises that undertake the main tasks, must launch a mass movement centered on technological revolution to produce more and better electrical machinery products. The content of the technological revolution in electrical machinery manufacturing is, first of all, to focus on those important links that can guarantee the realization of this year's leap forward plan, such as improving product structure so that the design is based on domestic materials; improving process methods to increase heat processing capacity; creating simple special-purpose equipment; and improving production organization to reasonably adjust production lines, etc. Only by vigorously carrying out technological revolution in all aspects can we fully realize the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical. Secondly, it is to accelerate the process of mastering technology and break through the barriers of heavy, large, precision, and cutting-edge technology. Scientific research work should be closely integrated with production, with both long-term goals and current realities, from near to far, in order to achieve practical results quickly.

    In order to successfully complete the task of the electrical machinery manufacturing industry in 1959, we must also solve the problem of coordination and matching. There is not only a certain proportional relationship between the electrical machinery manufacturing industry and other sectors of the national economy, such as the amount of power generation equipment and the output of steel, but also a certain proportion within the electrical machinery manufacturing industry, such as motors and power, power generation equipment and transmission and distribution equipment, and motors and electrical materials. If these proportions are not maintained, a mismatch will occur. Therefore, the production of power generation equipment must be comprehensively arranged according to the principle of planned and proportionate development, and avoidable uncoordinated phenomena should be avoided as much as possible, so that coordination and matching can proceed smoothly and electrical products can be put into production in complete sets and in a timely manner. The electrical machinery manufacturing industry is an industry with a very wide service area. In addition to providing power station equipment to the power industry, it also needs to provide various electrical equipment and electrical materials to other industries, transportation, and agriculture. The electrical appliances and materials needed for people's material and cultural life must also be supplied by the electrical machinery manufacturing industry. The electrical machinery industry also needs the assistance and cooperation of other industrial sectors to complete its tasks well. For example, the steel needed by the electrical machinery industry depends on the supply of the metallurgical sector, mica flakes and glass fibers depend on the supply of the building materials sector, various insulating papers depend on the supply of the light industry sector, transformer oil depends on the supply of the petroleum industry sector, and many chemical materials depend on the supply of the chemical industry sector. In particular, copper and aluminum are key materials for the electrical machinery manufacturing industry, and their guaranteed supply is especially important by other relevant industrial sectors. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the electrical machinery manufacturing industry consumed more than half of the total amount of copper and aluminum provided by the country each year, and the demand this year is even greater. Therefore, the places and departments that produce copper and aluminum must seize the production and construction of the copper and aluminum industry, and should pay as much attention to the production of copper and aluminum as they do to steel.

    1959 is a year of unprecedented and tremendous development for China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry, and we must fight this battle well. The completion of the state-stipulated electrical machinery manufacturing plan for this year will not only lay a solid foundation for China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry, but also be an important guarantee for completing the leap forward plan of the entire industrial production centered on 18 million tons of steel.

    制造更多更好的发电设备
    我国电机制造工业在1958年大跃进中有了巨大的发展。1958年，我国电机制造工业的总产值和电动机、变压器、高压开关、电线电缆等主要电工产品的产量，较之1957年都增长了一倍以上；发电设备的产量从1957年的不到二十万瓩增加到1958年的九十多万瓩，猛增三倍多，等于第一个五年计划期间产量总和的两倍。电机制造技术也大大地提高了，许多重大的新产品都在这一年诞生了。其中包括二万五千瓩的汽轮发电机组，七万二千五百瓩的水轮发电机，每小时蒸发量二百三十吨的高压锅炉，二十二万伏特的高压电缆，一百三十八吨的交流干线电机车等等。这些新产品的制成，标志着我国电机制造工业正在向世界的先进技术水平大踏步地前进。
    党的八届六中全会指出，1959年是我国苦战三年的决定性的一年，将要实现比1958年更加伟大的跃进。为了满足国民经济各部门的发展对电力日益增长的需要，1959年电机制造工业也必须实现更大的跃进，根据初步计算，1959年发电设备的生产将大大地超过1958年，它的发展速度不但在电机制造工业上将是空前的，而且在我国国民经济1959年的跃进指标中也将是最突出的。电机制造工业的全体职工，必须鼓足干劲，力争上游，坚决完成1959年的光荣而艰巨的任务。
    为了胜利地完成1959年电机制造的任务，最重要的是千方百计扩大生产能力。与全年任务比较起来，目前电机制造的生产能力还差得多。这就要求现有企业尤其是基础较好的大型企业充分发挥生产潜力。在这些企业中，应当继续反对保守，大搞群众运动，积极采取具体措施，把70％的发电设备的制造任务勇敢地担当起来。有没有这种可能性呢？回答是肯定的。譬如，具有现代化装备的哈尔滨电机厂，去年头三个季度所生产的发电设备是二十一万瓩，而在第四季度，由于加强了领导，发动了群众，一个季度的产量便超过了前三个季度的总和；原定在今年才开始试制的七万二千五百瓩的水轮发电机也在去年底以前试制成功了。这证明依靠“大洋群”，提高“单位面积产量”，争取“大面积丰收”，不但是可能的，而且是扩大生产能力的最快和最有效的办法。与此同时，还应当继续采取小土群的办法来制造小型的简易的发电设备。去年，我国农村用土法兴办了大量的小型电站，据不完全统计，总容量在十万瓩以上。尽管电机制造的主力是“大洋群”，高温、高压、高速、大容量的产品需要由大型企业试制和生产，但是，“小土群”的力量仍绝不能轻视。在电机制造中，必须坚决贯彻以大型为主、大中小结合的方针，才能适应工业发展的需要。
    扩大电机制造能力的另一个重要方面是抓紧新建和扩建企业的建设，争取尽早建成并投入生产。因为今年电机生产的任务，有半数以上需要由这些新建企业来承担，早建成一个工厂，就早增加一分力量。因此，在安排基本建设项目的时候，必须本着保证重点、全面安排的精神。已经开始施工的扩建工程和新建工厂的收尾工程尤应促其迅速完成，以便及早投入生产，发挥作用。同时，在统一规划之下，一切可以制造电器产品的部门，特别是使用电器产品的部门，如汽车厂、机床厂等，也应当在保证完成本企业原定生产任务的前提下，尽可能增设电器车间，制造自己所需要的部分电工协作产品。非机械部门的机修力量也应当担负一部分力所能及的电器产品的制造任务。电站修理部门基础较好，技术力量较强，更是一支不可忽视的力量。使用部门参加制造，其好处不只是可以解决自己的一部分问题，而且为进一步改进产品的结构和性能提供了有利的条件。无论哪方面的力量，特别是担负主要任务的大型电机企业，都必须开展以技术革命为中心的群众运动，更多更好地增产电机产品。电机制造技术革命的内容，首先是要抓紧那些能保证实现今年跃进计划的重要环节，如改进产品结构，使设计立足于国内材料之上；改进工艺方法，提高热加工能力；创制简易的专用设备；改善生产组织，合理地调整生产线等等。只有各方面大搞技术革命，才能全面实现多快好省的要求。其次，是加速掌握技术的过程，突破重型、大型、精密、尖端的关。科学研究工作应当密切结合生产，既有远大的目标，又结合当前实际，由近及远，才能迅速收到实效。
    为了胜利地完成1959年电机制造工业的任务，还必须解决协作配套问题。电机制造工业不但与国民经济其他部门之间，例如发电设备保有量与钢产量之间存在着一定的比例关系，而且在电机制造工业内部，例如电机与动力，发电设备与输电、配电设备，电机与电工器材等，都有一定的比例。如果不保持这些比例，就会产生不配套的现象。因此必须根据有计划按比例的原则全面安排发电设备的生产，尽量避免可以避免的不协调现象，使协作配套工作能顺利进行，使电器产品能成套地、及时地投入生产。电机制造工业是服务面非常广的一个行业。除了要向电力工业提供电站设备以外，还要向其他工业、交通运输业以及农业提供各种电器设备和电工器材。人民物质生活和文化生活中所需要的电器和材料也要由电机制造工业供给。而电机工业也需要其它工业部门的协助和配合，才能很好完成自己的任务。例如，电机工业需要的钢材有赖于冶金部门供给，云母片、玻璃丝有赖于建筑材料部门供给，各种绝缘纸有赖于轻工业部门供给，变压器油有赖于石油工业部门供给，不少化工材料有赖于化学工业部门供给。特别是铜和铝，是电机制造工业的关键性材料，尤须其它有关工业部门的保证供应。在第一个五年计划期间，电机制造工业每年平均消耗全国提供的铜铝总量一半以上，今年的需要量更大，因之生产铜铝的地方和部门必须抓紧铜铝工业的生产和建设，应当像重视钢铁那样地重视铜铝的生产。
    1959年是我国电机制造工业空前巨大发展的一年，我们一定要打好这一仗。完成了今年国家规定的电机制造计划，不仅能为我国的电机制造业打下一个雄厚的基础，而且对完成以一千八百万吨钢为中心的整个工业生产的跃进计划将是一个重要的保证。
