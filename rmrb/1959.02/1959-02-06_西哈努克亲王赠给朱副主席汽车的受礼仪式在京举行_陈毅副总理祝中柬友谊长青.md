Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch: The acceptance ceremony for the five cars presented by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, to Vice Chairman Zhu De was held this afternoon at the International Friendship Hall of the Palace Museum in Beijing. Mr. Yang An, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Cambodian Embassy in China, presented the gifts on behalf of Prince Sihanouk, and Vice Premier Chen Yi accepted the gifts on behalf of Vice Chairman Zhu De.

    After accepting the gifts, Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "From these gifts, we once again realize the kinship-like profound friendship of Prince Sihanouk, the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and the Cambodian people towards the Chinese people." "The friendly relations between China and Cambodia cannot be undermined by any imperialist slander because our relationship is not only built on the firm foundation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, but also conforms to the common aspirations of the people of both countries for sincere and selfless friendly cooperation in order to develop their national economies." Vice Premier Chen Yi wished the friendship between China and Cambodia would last forever.

    In his speech at the beginning of the ceremony, Yang An said, "These vehicles are a small gift from the Kingdom of Cambodia to the friendly People's Republic of China, which has consistently provided her with generous assistance for the past two years." He said that the economy is the main foundation of Cambodia's national independence. He praised China's economic assistance to Cambodia as "fraternal assistance."

    Ji Pengfei, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ding Xilin, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and some members of the Chinese Women's Delegation who visited Cambodia last year attended the ceremony.

    陈毅副总理祝中柬友谊长青
    新华社5日讯　柬埔寨王国首相诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王赠送给朱德副主席五辆小汽车的受礼仪式，今天下午在北京故宫博物院国际友谊馆举行。柬埔寨驻中国临时代办杨安代表西哈努克亲王赠礼，陈毅副总理代表朱德副主席受礼。
    陈毅副总理在受礼后讲话说：“从这些礼品中，我们再一次体会到西哈努克亲王、柬埔寨王国政府和柬埔寨人民对于中国人民亲戚般的深厚友谊。”“中柬两国的友好关系是任何帝国主义的造谣中伤所无法破坏的，因为我们之间的关系不仅是建筑在和平共处五项原则的牢固基础上的，而且也是符合两国人民为了发展本国经济而进行真诚无私的友好合作的共同愿望的。”陈毅副总理祝中柬友好万年长青。
    杨安在仪式开始时的讲话中说：“这些车辆是柬埔寨王国赠给两年来一贯给予她慷慨援助的友邦中华人民共和国的一分微薄礼物。”他说经济是柬埔寨民族独立的主要基础。他赞扬中国对柬埔寨的经济援助是“兄弟般的援助”。
    外交部副部长姬鹏飞，对外文化联络委员会副主任丁西林，去年曾访问过柬埔寨的中国妇女代表团部分团员等参加了仪式。
