    Between People and Dogs
    By Pan Fei, Our Correspondent

    An advertisement promoting dog biscuits reads: "Crisp and chewy biscuits, just right for a dog's teeth and appetite. Biscuits contain the following ingredients to promote health: wheat, cod liver oil, liver, fish, meat, and nutritious fats."

    In London, it is not an exaggeration to say that dogs enjoy far more respect than ordinary people. In addition to dog biscuits and canned dog food, there are also special "vitamin" pills for dogs.

    While dogs are gnawing on biscuits and swallowing tonics, ordinary people in Britain are consuming more and more margarine to replace nutritious, real butter. Calculated per capita, the consumption of many foods is much lower than before the war (it is worth noting that pre-war levels were already very low). For example, fruit consumption is down 6%; grain products are down 8%.

    A worker's wife, Helen Manning, confided in me her worries and troubles. She said, "The children are growing, and they should eat some fruit. But I can't afford it; oranges cost four and a half pence each!"

    Four and a half pence—this is a tiny amount. The British upper class keeps three million dogs. Gentlemen spend 40 million pounds annually on dog food.

    A unique industry has been built around the joys of dog ownership. London has 98 stores selling dog supplies, five dog food companies, one dog pharmaceutical company, and fourteen dog grooming salons...
  This is still a very incomplete statistic.

    There is a type of dog called a "Poodle." Poodles have a dense coat of curly hair, and the dog grooming salon exists to serve them. The groomer shaves all the hair off its back and buttocks; carefully trims the hair on other parts; and leaves a pom-pom of fluff at the tip of the shaved tail—this is the most popular style.

    I visited a dog grooming salon near Oxford Street. There, the normal concepts of "person" and "dog" were completely confused.

    Before grooming, a poodle must be washed. This has a very elegant name, called "shampoo." (Unfortunately, in English, washing a person's hair is also called "shampoo.") After this, they stand on specially made tables, where the groomer carefully serves them. The electric clippers make a "zzzzz..." sound as they move across the poodle's back. Seeing the exposed greasy, grayish-brown skin, I couldn't help but shudder.

      "How often do they come? Every six months?" I asked rather naively.

    The groomer lifted the poodle's chin with his left hand, snipped a few times around its mouth as if trimming a dignified, gentlemanly "Van Dyke beard," and then turned to scrutinize me for a few seconds:

    "Hey! That won't do. Three weeks!" He picked up a shiny white steel nail clipper and began to trim the poodle's claws.

    A British lady walked in. She said "Hello," and a poodle immediately darted forward, jumping and whimpering. The British lady cooed endearingly, "Darling, darling..." while taking out thirty shillings to pay for it.

    In London, the average haircut for a man costs three shillings.

    Besides dog grooming salons, there are also dog bathhouses. Stepping into the door of this bathhouse, there is a spacious room. Here, various dog portraits are hung. The bathhouse owner opened a side door and led me into the bathing room. It is equipped with white porcelain bathtubs, hot and cold water faucets, and all possible "material civilization." Snow-white "Dalmatians" dotted with black spots, short and fat "Dachshunds" resembling sausages, tall and fierce "Boxers"... these different breeds of dogs were taken out of the bathtub one by one, and young women wearing white coats blow-dried them. The bathhouse's advertisement reads: "Electric blow-drying after bathing prevents coughs."

    The bathhouse owner opened a drawer in the filing cabinet and skillfully pulled out a few cards. These are the "files" of Princess Margaret's (the Queen's sister) two dogs, with the dates of each visit and other necessary records written on them. The owner showed a proud expression and told me:

    "It's not just Princess Margaret, Eden, the Queen Mother, the Earl of Gloucester... they are all our regular customers."

    The bathhouse owner felt proud. My feeling was: "Man," this noble title, was subjected to the greatest insult.

    I remember that in the Stepney district of East London, 22,800 of the 30,000 households did not have bathroom facilities. They could only boil a pot of warm water, stand in a small tin basin, and pour the water over themselves from head to toe.

    I also remember that worker Simms complained to me that his children had never slept in a bed. The older children slept on a broken sofa at night, and the younger ones slept in a stroller.

    However, in the shop windows selling dog supplies, dog beds, knitted vests, nylon raincoats, canvas boots, and even dog toys are displayed.

    People do not enjoy the treatment they deserve. Dogs, on the other hand, live like people.

    Perhaps treating dogs as people is a kind of "pleasure." It has become a part of the empty spiritual life of the British upper class. Taking dogs for walks, kissing dogs, taking dogs for car rides...

      When British gentlemen and ladies no longer find these things interesting, some newer tricks emerge. Initiated by the "Daily Mirror" and organized by the "National Animal Welfare Association," the second "Animal Feast" will be held in London on February 10. The "Daily Mirror" devoted almost an entire page to previewing this news. It wrote:

    "In the hall, they will sit, stand, or perch under the brilliant lights to hold this magnificent feast. Participating will be all kinds of beloved animals.

    "These beloved animals will be the hosts. People will be the guests—including many famous figures.

    Dogs, cats, birds, sheep, horses, donkeys, short-snouted crocodiles, will dine with... the most famous figures."

    The "Daily Mirror" praised: "What a feast this will be!"

    Indeed, what kind of "feast" will this be? (Attached pictures)

    人狗之间
    本报记者　潘非
    一幅推销狗饼干的广告写道：“松脆又耐嚼的饼干，正好适合狗的牙齿和胃口。饼干包含如下成分以增进健康：小麦、鱼肝油、肝、鱼、肉，以及富有营养的脂肪。”
    在伦敦，说狗享受着比普通人高得多的尊敬，是并不过分的。除了狗饼干、狗罐头以外，还有专门给狗服用的“维他命”丸。
    当狗啃着饼干、吞着补药的时候，英国的普通人正在消费着愈来愈多的人造奶油，用它来代替有营养的、真正的奶油。按人口平均计算，目前许多食品的消费量，比战前大大减少了（值得注意的是，战前的水平已经是很低的）。例如，水果降低6％；谷物制品降低8％。
    一个工人的妻子海伦·马宁，向我倾诉过她的愁绪和烦恼。她说：“孩子们正在发育，他们应该吃一点水果。但是我买不起，橙子要四个半铜板一只！”
    四个半铜板——这是微乎其微的数目。英国上流社会喂养着三百万条狗。绅士们在狗的吃食上花的钱，每年是四千万英镑。
    围绕着养狗的乐趣，建立起了一门独特的行业。伦敦有九十八家出卖狗用品的商店，五家狗食
  品公司，一家狗制药公司，十四家狗理发店……。
  这还是个很不完整的统计。
    有一种狗叫做“泼特尔”。泼特尔长着一身稠密的鬈毛，狗理发店就是为它服务的。理发师把它的背部、臀部的毛全都推光；对其他部分的毛加以细心的修剪；剃得光秃秃的尾巴的尖端，留下一撮绣球似的绒毛——这是目前最流行的样式。
    我参观过牛津街附近的一家狗理发店。在那儿，“人”和“狗”的正常概念，已完全混淆。
    泼特尔在理发以前，先要洗涤一下。这，有个很文雅的名称，叫做“香波”。（不幸的是，在英语里，人的洗头也叫“香波”。）在这之后，它们站在特制的桌子上，由理发师小心谨慎地伺候着。电动的推子发出“得尔尔……”的声音，在泼特尔的脊梁上移动。看到那露出来的油腻腻、灰褐色的皮肉，我不禁打了个冷颤。
      “它们多长时间来一次？半年？”我问得十分外行。
    理发师用左手托起泼特尔的下巴，在它的嘴边嚓嚓几剪刀，就像在修饰一部威武的、绅士们的“仁丹胡”一样，然后转过脸来端详我几秒钟：
    “嘿！那怎么能行。三个星期！”他拿起了一把雪亮的白钢指甲刀，开始为泼特尔修脚爪。
    一个英国太太推进门来。她一声“哈罗”，一只泼特尔立刻窜上前去，跳着，呜呜地叫着。英国太太一边亲热地哼哼着“亲爱的，亲爱的……”，一边掏出三十个先令为它付账。
    在伦敦，普通一个男子的理发费是：三个先令。
    除了狗理发店，还有狗澡堂。走进这家澡堂的大门，是一间宽敞的房间。在这里，挂满了各式各样的狗的画像。澡堂老板打开一扇侧门，把我引进洗澡间。这儿装着白磁浴盆，冷、热水龙头，和一切可能利用的“物质文明”。混身雪白、间有朵朵黑花的“达尔梅兴”，又矮又胖，好像一节腊肠似的“达克香”，身材高大、表情凶悍的“拳斗家”……这些不同品种的狗，一只又一只地从浴盆里被抱出来，由穿着白罩衣的姑娘给它们吹风。这家澡堂的广告上写着：“浴后电气吹风，免致感染咳嗽。”
    澡堂老板打开文件柜的抽屉，熟练地抽出几张卡片。这是马格累特公主（女皇的妹妹）的两只狗的“档案”，上面写着历次来这儿洗澡的日期和其他必要的记载。老板流露出得意的神色告诉我：
    “不光是马格累特公主，艾登、女皇的母亲、格劳斯特伯爵……都是我们的老主顾。”
    澡堂老板感到骄傲。我的感觉是：“人”，这个高贵的称号，受到了最大的侮辱。
    我记得，在东伦敦史坦伯尼区，三万户居民中，有二万二千八百多家没有洗澡间设备。他们只能烧一壶温水，站在只小洋铁盆里，把水从头到脚地浇下去。
    我还记得，工人西姆斯向我诉苦：他的孩子从来没有睡过床。大孩子晚上睡在张破沙发里，小的就睡在婴儿车里。
    但是，在出卖狗用品的商店橱窗里，却陈列有狗的床铺，狗穿的毛线背心、尼龙雨衣、帆布靴
  子，甚至还有狗的玩具。
    人，享受不到应有的待遇。狗，却过着人一样
  的生活。
    也许，把狗当作人，这是种“乐趣”。它已成为英国上流社会空洞的精神生活的一部分。牵着狗散步，抱着狗接吻，带着狗坐汽车兜风……
      当英国的绅士和太太对这些也不再感到兴趣时，一些更新奇的花样出来了。由“每日镜报”发起，“全国爱兽协会”举办的第二届禽兽宴，将在2月10日在伦敦举行。“每日镜报”几乎以一整版的地位，预告这一新闻。它写道：
    “在大厅里，它们将在灿烂的灯光下坐着、站着，或者歇在栖木上，来举行这个壮丽的宴会。参加的有各种各样的爱兽。
    “这些爱兽将是主人。人，将是宾客——其中有很多著名人物。
    狗、猫、鸟、羊、马、驴、短鼻鳄鱼，将和……最著名的人物共同进餐。”
    “每日镜报”歌颂道：“这将是个什么样的宴会呵！”
    真的，这将是个什么样的“宴会”呢？（附图片）
