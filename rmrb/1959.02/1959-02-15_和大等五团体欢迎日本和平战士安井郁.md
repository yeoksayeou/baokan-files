Xinhua News Agency, February 14th – At a mass meeting held in Beijing today to welcome Ikuo Yasui, the Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and winner of the International Lenin Prize "For Strengthening Peace Between Peoples," Liao Chengzhi, Vice-Chairman of the China Peace Committee, expressed firm support for the Japanese people's struggle to defend peace and strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's attitude of hostility towards the Chinese people.

Liao Chengzhi said that the Chinese people strictly distinguish between the peace-loving Japanese people and the Kishi Nobusuke government, which follows the United States in its hostility towards the Chinese people. The Japanese people can fully expect to receive the sympathy and support of the Chinese people in their struggle to defend peace and independence and to oppose dragging Japan onto the path of aggressive war.

Today's welcoming rally was jointly held by The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation, the and the All-China Women's Federation.

At the meeting to welcome the Japanese friend, Liao Chengzhi warmly praised the Japanese people's firm will to defend peace, saying that our attitude towards the enemies of the Chinese people is unwavering. But towards friends, we are always sincere and treat our friends' struggles as our own and our friends' victories as our own.

The welcoming rally began at 3 p.m. When Mr. Ikuo Yasui, accompanied by Liao Chengzhi and others, entered the venue and stepped onto the podium, all those present stood up and applauded warmly to welcome this world-renowned peace activist.

Among those attending the meeting were Bao Erhan, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, Xu Zhizhen, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Li Dequan, Vice-Chairman of the National Women's Federation, Yang Jingren, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, and Ding Xilin, Vice-President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. Also present were some Japanese and Korean peace activists in Beijing.

Liao Chengzhi first addressed the meeting, extending a warm welcome to Mr. Ikuo Yasui's visit to China. He said, we would like to express our heartfelt respect to the Japanese people who are standing up to fight ever more widely and strongly, and we ask Mr. Ikuo Yasui to convey the Chinese people's friendly greetings and wishes to the Japanese people, and wish them continuous new achievements in their struggle.

At the meeting, Liao Chengzhi condemned the U.S. imperialist nuclear war policy and the criminal acts of U.S. nuclear weapons testing. He pointed out that the U.S. aggressive bloc is the center of all reactionary forces in the world today, and its war and aggressive policies are the root cause of the threat to world peace and the security of all peoples. Therefore, today, all struggles to defend world peace and oppose nuclear weapons are closely linked and inseparable from the struggle against the war and colonial policies of imperialism headed by the United States.

Liao Chengzhi said that the Chinese people have always supported the Japanese people's efforts and struggles to strive for peace, independence, and democracy and to oppose the U.S. policy of nuclear war threats, and the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples has a long history. However, the Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan is following the U.S. aggressors in every way, adopting an undisguised hostile attitude towards the Chinese people and carrying out a series of actions hostile to the Chinese people. Liao Chengzhi said that if Kishi Nobusuke is determined to act as an accomplice of the United States in its aggression against China and Asia, and stubbornly continues to implement the reactionary policies of hostility towards China, creating "two Chinas" and obstructing the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan, then he will only arouse increasingly fierce opposition from the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and all the people of Asia and Africa, and suffer the consequences.

Mr. Ikuo Yasui then delivered a long speech entitled "The Movement in Japan to Demand the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is the Foundation for Opening Sino-Japanese Relations." As he approached the podium, the audience once again burst into welcoming applause, at which point Mr. Ikuo Yasui raised his clenched hands to express his gratitude to those who welcomed him. He said that he had wanted to visit China long ago, and now his wish has been realized. He said that he was very happy to meet with all of his friends during this joyful Spring Festival.

Mr. Ikuo Yasui reported to his Chinese friends on the history and current situation of the Japanese movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, as well as its future development trends. Yasui Ikuo said that the root cause of the attempt to forcibly nuclear arm Japan and suppress democracy lies in U.S. imperialism and the latent Japanese imperialism that is colluding with it. He pointed out that the basic line of the movement to demand the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs in Japan today is to use action to prevent the revival of Japanese imperialism and militarism, to shatter the attempt to nuclear arm Japan, and to liberate the Japanese mainland and Okinawa Island from the U.S. imperialist atomic strategy system and move towards a path of peace and neutrality.

Yasui Ikuo said that today in the Far East, imperialists are promoting the plan of piecing together a military bloc consisting of Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, transporting nuclear weapons and missiles into these regions, and have already begun to arm the armies of these countries with nuclear weapons. Mr. Ikuo Yasui condemned this as an open act of hostility towards the people of Asian countries, especially the Chinese people, and also an act of exacerbating the tense situation in the Far East.

This peace activist strongly expressed to those present that the Japanese people will absolutely not be willing to allow their motherland to fall into such a dangerous situation. The Japanese people do not want to be hostile to any country, and at the same time, they will absolutely not allow other countries to use Japan for their strategic purposes. These words of his aroused warm applause from the audience.

Mr. Ikuo Yasui said that in the situation where "the East Wind prevails over the West Wind," this year's peace movement must deal a decisive blow to the forces of war. Mr. Ikuo Yasui expressed the hope that the people of all countries in the world, especially the Chinese people, can take joint action with the Japanese people.

Mr. Ikuo Yasui concluded with confidence that the two great mountains of imperialism and militarism are now largely collapsing and breaking apart. With the correct theoretical guidance, the people of the world will make unremitting efforts and take joint action for the cause of peace, and these two great mountains will one day completely disappear from the earth. The audience responded with prolonged and warm applause, thanking this peace activist for his speech full of friendship and fighting confidence.

After the welcoming rally, three Chinese documentaries and a Japanese documentary, "Peace Doves Are Flying," were shown. This Japanese documentary was brought by Mr. Ikuo Yasui from Japan as a gift to the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace. The film recorded the proceedings of the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament held in Tokyo last year.

    和大等五团体欢迎日本和平战士安井郁  
    支持日本人民争取和平和独立的斗争
    谴责岸信介政府敌视中国人民的态度
    新华社14日讯　在北京今天举行的欢迎日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长、“加强国际和平”列宁国际奖金获得者安井郁先生的群众大会上，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席廖承志表示坚决支持日本人民保卫和平的斗争，并且严厉谴责岸信介政府敌视中国人民的态度。
    廖承志说，中国人民是把爱好和平的日本人民和追随美国敌视中国人民的岸信介政府严格地区别起来看待的，日本人民在他们维护和平和独立、反对把日本拖上侵略战争道路的斗争中，完全可以指望得到中国人民的同情和支持。
    今天的欢迎大会是由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国亚非团结委员会、中华全国总工会、中华全国青年联合会和中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会联合举行的。
    廖承志在欢迎日本朋友的这个大会上，热烈赞扬了日本人民保卫和平的坚强意志，他说，对于中国人民的敌人，我们的态度是坚定不移的。但是对于朋友，我们永远是竭诚相待，把朋友的斗争看作我们自己的斗争，把朋友的胜利看作我们自己的胜利。
    欢迎大会在下午三时开始。当安井郁先生由廖承志等陪同进入会场登上主席台时，到会者全体起立鼓掌，热烈欢迎这位世界著名的和平战士。
    参加大会的，有中国亚非团结委员会副主席包尔汉，中华全国总工会副主席许之桢，全国妇联副主席李德全，中华全国青年联合会副主席杨静仁，对外文化协会副会长丁西林。参加大会的还有在北京的一些日本和朝鲜的和平人士。
    廖承志首先在会上致词，他对安井郁先生来我国访问表示热烈的欢迎。他说，我们谨向愈益广泛和坚强地站起来斗争的日本人民表示衷心的敬意，我们请安井郁先生向日本人民转达中国人民的友谊问候和祝愿，祝他们的斗争不断取得新的成就。
    廖承志在会上谴责了美帝国主义核战争政策和美国核武器试验的犯罪行为。他指出，美国侵略集团是今天世界上一切反动势力的中心，它所推行的战争侵略政策是世界和平与各国人民安全受到威胁的根源。因此，在今天，保卫世界和平、反对核武器的一切斗争，是同反对以美国为首的帝国主义的战争和殖民政策的斗争密切结合而不可分割的。
    廖承志说，中国人民一向支持日本人民争取和平、独立与民主和反对美国推行核战争威胁政策的一切努力和斗争，中日两国人民之间的友谊是有着悠久的历史的。但是，日本的岸信介政府却处处追随美国侵略者，对中国人民采取露骨的敌视态度和做出了一系列的敌视中国人民的行为。廖承志说，岸信介如果决心充当美国侵略中国和亚洲的帮凶，执迷不悟地继续执行敌视中国，制造“两个中国”和阻挠中日正常关系恢复的反动政策，那就只有更加激起中国人民、日本人民和全亚非人民的越来越激烈的反对，而自食其果。
    安井郁先生接着发表了题为“日本要求禁止原子弹、氢弹的运动是打开中日关系的基础”的长篇讲话。当他走近讲台时，全场再一次响起欢迎的掌声，这时安井郁先生高举起紧握的双手，向欢迎他的人们表示谢意。他说，我在很久以前就想到中国来访问，这次我的希望实现了。他说他在这可喜的春节中同诸位朋友见面，内心感到非常高兴。
    安井郁先生向他的中国朋友报告了日本禁止原子弹氢弹运动的历史和现状以及今后的发展动向。安井郁说，在日本企图强行核武装、企图压制民主的根源，就是美帝国主义以及和它勾结在一起的潜在的日本帝国主义。他指出，今天日本要求禁止原子弹氢弹运动的基本路线，就是要用行动来阻止日本帝国主义、军国主义的复活，粉碎日本核武装化的企图；使日本本土及冲绳岛从美帝国主义的原子战略体系中解放出来，走向和平中立的道路。
    安井郁说，今天在远东，帝国主义者正在推进把日本、台湾、南朝鲜等拼凑在一起的军事集团计划，把核武器和导弹运进这些地区，并且已经开始用核武器武装这些国家的军队。安井郁先生谴责说，这是对亚洲各国人民，特别是对中国人民的公开的敌对行为，而且也是加剧远东紧张局势的行为。
    这位和平战士向到会者强烈地表示，日本人民绝对不会甘心自己的祖国陷入这样危险的境地。日本人民不愿敌视任何国家，同时也绝对不允许其它国家为了它的战略目的而利用日本。他的这些话激起了全场热烈的掌声。
    安井郁先生说，在“东风压倒西风”的形势下，今年的和平运动必须对战争势力给予决定性的打击。安井郁先生表示希望世界各国人民尤其是中国人民，能够和日本人民采取共同行动。
    安井郁先生最后满怀信心地说，帝国主义和军国主义这两座大山，现在它的相当大的部分已经在倒塌崩裂，全世界人民在正确的理论指导下，为和平事业进行不懈的努力和共同行动，这两座大山终有一天会在地面上完全消失的。到会者报以长时间的热烈掌声，感谢这位和平战士的充满了友谊和斗争信心的讲话。
    欢迎大会以后放映了三部中国纪录片和日本纪录片——“和平鸽在飞翔”。这部日本纪录片是安井郁先生由日本带来赠送给中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的。影片纪录了去年在东京举行的第四届禁止原子弹氢弹与争取裁军世界大会的进行情形。
