Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, February 23rd: The Royal Government of Cambodia issued a communique today stating that the Royal Government took military action yesterday in Siem Reap Province against the treasonous crimes of Siem Reap Province Governor, Nhiek Tioulong.

The communique said: "In recent days, the Royal Government has received information from domestic and foreign sources indicating that the Royal Delegate to Siem Reap and Military Region Commander, Nhiek Tioulong, has changed his attitude due to the activities of those major powers who are directing the Bangkok anti-Cambodia plan."

Immediate surveillance revealed that a South Vietnamese diplomat residing in Cambodia had contacted Nhiek Tioulong to enlist his services, and the latter had personally gone to the airport to receive large boxes transported by South Vietnamese aircraft.

According to reliable sources, Nhiek Tioulong had accepted a large sum of money, highly modern weapons, and ammunition. He immediately arranged for a way out, moving equipment out of the barracks. Under these circumstances, the Royal Government had no choice but to order the arrest of Nhiek Tioulong, as he endangered domestic and foreign security.

The Royal Armed Forces, personally commanded by Royal Army Chief of Staff and Minister of Defense Lon Nol, arrived in Siem Reap on Sunday. Nhiek Tioulong fled in panic, taking with him several small detachments that he had prepared in advance in the forest for guerrilla warfare. His officers and troops did not follow him, and are cooperating with the Royal Army General Staff to maintain order in Siem Reap City and Siem Reap Province. There, loyal troops control the central areas. As of now, not a single shot has been fired.

The Royal Army was not surprised to discover two South Vietnamese officers and a brand-new transmitter not obtained from our warehouses in Nhiek Tioulong's villa. Seized documents undeniably confirm Nhiek Tioulong's treason and his frequent contact with foreign countries.

Major General Ou Khieu has temporarily assumed the position of Royal Delegate to Siem Reap and Commander of this military region.

The government has good control of the situation in this province.

    柬埔寨破获一起叛国案
    暹粒省省长在外国支持下阴谋发动叛乱
    政府立即采取军事行动已控制当地局势
    新华社金边23日电　柬埔寨王国政府今天发表公报说：王国政府昨天在暹粒省对暹粒省省长琼·莫舒皮的叛国罪行采取了军事行动。
    公报说：“最近几天以来，王国政府获得来自国内和外国的情报说明，皇廷驻暹粒代表和军区司令琼·莫舒皮由于那些主持执行曼谷反对柬埔寨的计划的大国对他进行了活动而改变了他的态度。”
    立即组织起来的监视工作表明，一位住在柬埔寨的南越外交官曾同琼·莫舒皮接触，以争取他的效劳，而后者曾亲自去机场接收由南越飞机运来的大箱子。
    据可靠消息，琼·莫舒皮曾接受一大笔钱、十分现代化的武器和弹药。他立即安排了后路，把装备搬出兵营。在这种情况下，王国政府只得下令逮捕琼·莫舒皮，因为他危害国内和国外的安全。
    由皇家军队总参谋长、国防大臣朗诺亲自指挥的皇家武装部队，在星期天开到暹粒。琼·莫舒皮仓皇逃走，并把他事先准备打游击而布置在森林中的几个小队带走。他的军官和部队没有跟从他，而正在同皇家军队总参谋部合作，在暹粒市和暹粒省维持秩序。在那里，忠实的部队控制着各个中心地区。截至目前为止没有放一枪。
    王国军队并不吃惊地在琼·莫舒皮的别墅里发现了两位南越军官和不是从我们的仓库里取得的一架崭新的发报机。缴获的一些文件无可否认地肯定了琼·莫舒皮的叛国和他同外国的经常联系。
    吴乌少将暂时担任皇廷驻暹粒代表和这个军区司令职务。
    政府在这个省很好地控制了局势。
