Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, February 26th: Anshan Iron and Steel Company will train nearly 100,000 new technical workers for the iron and steel industry front across the country and for its own enterprise this year.

The Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Anshan Iron and Steel Committee of the Communist Youth League jointly held an experience exchange conference on training technicians on the 18th. Representatives from various factories and mines who attended the meeting expressed their determination to accelerate the training of new workers in every possible way, in order to increase new technical strength for the battle to seize 18 million tons of steel this year.

In 1958, Anshan Iron and Steel Company transferred more than 5,000 technicians and trained more than 5,000 technicians on behalf of various regions, strongly supporting the great leap forward in fraternal enterprises and national steel production. The meeting summarized the new worker training work of Anshan Iron and Steel Company last year and exchanged experiences. It was believed that supporting the country with diverse high-quality steel and training various types of technical personnel for iron and steel enterprises were the two major tasks assigned to the Anshan Iron and Steel Base by the Central Committee, and also the unshirkable responsibility of all employees of Anshan Iron and Steel. In 1959, in addition to supporting a large number of technical workers to more than 20 large, medium and small iron and steel enterprises such as Wuhan Iron and Steel and Baotou Iron and Steel, Anshan Iron and Steel will also be entrusted to train more than 50,000 workers sent from 26 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions across the country. Up to now, more than 27,000 workers have been sent from various places for entrusted training.

    向全国钢铁战线输送骨干力量
    鞍钢培训大批技工
    据新华社鞍山26日电　鞍钢今年将为全国各地钢铁工业战线和本企业培训近十万名新的技术工人。
    鞍山钢铁公司和共青团鞍钢委员会在18日联合召开了培训技工经验交流大会。各厂矿到会代表都表示决心，要千方百计地加速培养新工人，为今年夺取一千八百万吨钢的战斗增加新的技术力量。
    鞍钢在1958年曾输送出技工五千多人，代各地培训出技工五千多人，有力地支援了各兄弟企业和全国钢铁生产大跃进。会议总结了去年鞍钢的新工人培训工作，交流了经验，认为以多种多样优质钢材和培训钢铁企业的各类技术人材支援全国，是中央交给鞍山钢铁基地的两大任务，也是鞍钢全体职工义不容辞的责任。1959年鞍钢除了支援武钢、包钢等二十多个大中小型钢铁企业大批技术工人以外，同时全国各地二十六个省、市、自治区将送来五万多名工人委托鞍钢培训。到目前为止，各地已送来委托培训的工人二万七千多名。
