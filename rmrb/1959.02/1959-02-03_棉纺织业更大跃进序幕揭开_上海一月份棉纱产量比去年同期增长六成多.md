Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 2nd. The cotton textile workers of Shanghai have opened the prelude to a greater leap forward this year, victoriously completing the January production plan, with the total monthly cotton yarn output increasing by more than 65% compared to the same period last year.

At the beginning of the new year, the workers of Shanghai's cotton textile factories summarized the achievements and experiences of the Great Leap Forward last year, and after discussing this year's leap forward plan, immediately set off a wave of enthusiasm for the leap forward. As a result, a new atmosphere of wave after wave, each wave higher than the last, emerged in various factories. The No. 13 State-owned Cotton Mill further carried out the competition of "learning from skilled workers, catching up with skilled workers." The spinning frame operators' ability to join broken threads per minute increased from eight to fourteen in the past to fourteen to twenty-four. At the same time, the spinning frame operators' ability to watch spindles has also been greatly improved. Taking 21-count yarn as an example, the worker's spindle watching ability increased from 600 spindles in the past to 800 spindles; for 42-count yarn, it increased from 800 spindles to 1,000 spindles, and some even expanded to 1,200 spindles.

In January, Shanghai's cotton textile industry also widely carried out mass technological revolutions centered on the comprehensive completion of the production plan. Many factories, targeting the weak links in their factories, proposed hundreds of technological revolution projects, and formed three-way combinations of leading cadres, technicians, and workers to attack the key to production.

The upsurge of "comparing with advanced, learning from advanced, and catching up with advanced" has also unfolded among the factories of Shanghai's cotton textile industry. The Tongyi Cotton Textile Factory, which had a relatively low level of production management, sent people to the No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mill, one of Shanghai's eight red banners, in January to learn from the enterprise management experience of the No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mill, and as a result, comprehensively completed the January production plan.

Currently, the workers of each factory have proposed to work as usual during the Spring Festival and ensure the overfulfillment of the February production plan.

    棉纺织业更大跃进序幕揭开
    上海一月份棉纱产量比去年同期增长六成多
    新华社上海2日电　上海棉纺工业职工揭开今年更大跃进的序幕，胜利地完成了1月份生产计划，全月棉纱产量比去年同期增长65％以上。
    上海各棉纺厂职工在新年初总结了去年大跃进的成就和经验，讨论了今年跃进计划之后，立即掀起了跃进热潮，因而各厂出现了一浪赶一浪、一浪高一浪的新气象。国棉十三厂进一步开展了“学能手、赶能手”的竞赛，细纱挡车工每分钟接头能力从去年的八到十四根提高为十四到二十四根。同时，挡车工的看锭能力也大大提高了。以二十一支纱为例，工人看锭能力从过去的六百锭提高到八百锭，四十二支纱从八百锭提高到一千锭，部分还扩大到一千二百锭。
    1月份，上海棉纺工业还围绕着全面完成生产计划广泛地开展了群众性的技术革命。许多工厂针对本厂的薄弱环节，提出了成百个技术革命的项目，并且组成了领导干部、技术人员和工人三结合的小组，猛攻生产关键。
    “比先进、学先进、赶先进”的热潮，也在上海棉纺工业厂际之间展开。生产管理水平较低的统益棉纺织厂，1月份派人到上海八面红旗之一的国棉二厂，学习国棉二厂的企业管理经验，结果全面完成了1月份生产计划。
    现在，各厂职工提出要在春节前后照常出勤，保证超额完成2月份的生产计划。
