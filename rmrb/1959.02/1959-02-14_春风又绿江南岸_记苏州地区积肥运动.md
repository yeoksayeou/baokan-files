    Spring Breeze Turns the South Bank Green Again
    ——A Record of the Fertilizer Accumulation Movement in the Suzhou Area
    By Our Reporters Gu Ping and Xu Wen
    "The phoenix doesn't alight on barren land; high yields come from fertile fields." The members of the people's communes in the Suzhou Special District of Jiangsu Province are vigorously accumulating fertilizer with twenty-four-point energy, striving to achieve the leap forward targets of 1,000 jin of summer wheat and doubling the rice yield again.
                  Heroes Make Havoc at "South Heavenly Gate"
    We first departed from Suzhou to Changshu County, famous throughout the country for its twenty-four-point energy. Upon arriving in Changshu County, a line of red flags and a line of people filled the fields. More than two hundred fertilizer accumulation shock teams named after heroic figures were engaged in a fervent competition to catch up with and surpass each other. Challenge letters, response letters, and determination pledges written in large red characters were plastered all over the blackboards at the edge of the fields. Evaluation boards for each shock team were erected under the red flags.

    This is the southernmost end of Changshu County, which the people of Changshu call the "South Heavenly Gate" in their competition with Wuxian County. After Changshu County issued a competitive proposal to the entire Suzhou area to "surpass rice with summer wheat and double the rice yield again," Wuxian County, south of Changshu, immediately responded, wanting to compete with Changshu. The two communes facing each other across the river—Xinzhuang Commune of Changshu and Weitang Commune of Wuxian—exchanged formal declarations of war.

    In order to win the competition against Weitang and defend the title, the "Dong Cunrui Demolition Platoon" accepted the glorious mission of guarding the "South Heavenly Gate." The day we visited the "Demolition Platoon," the sky was filled with drizzling rain. Each of the soldiers was wearing a raincoat and a bamboo hat, like heroes in full armor fighting on the battlefield. They were all barefoot, with their trousers rolled up to their knees, wielding iron spades with their powerful arms, stirring the crushed grass and river mud in the ditches. We met the deputy platoon leader, Wang Gensheng, a young and cheerful man with a smiling face. We asked him why they took the name "Demolition Platoon." He told us that their platoon, like the demolition heroes of the People's Liberation Army, went wherever the difficulties were greatest. This earned them the glorious name "Dong Cunrui Demolition Platoon." This heroic platoon devoted all its energy to the fertilizer accumulation battle for nearly half a month. They worked up a sweat in the cold, and carried on as usual even when the temperature was below zero degrees Celsius. They did not stop fighting for a single day during the rain, snow, and freeze.

    In the "Demolition Platoon," an old man with a full beard was also bare-foot, working together with everyone, which drew our attention. Didn't the deputy platoon leader say that the "Demolition Platoon" was all young people in their twenties? How did an old man appear? This old farmer seemed to have read our minds and took the initiative to tell us that he was a member of the nearby Eleventh Team. He had been watching these young people work so vigorously every day, and it made him envious, so he automatically ran over to work with the "Demolition Platoon."

    As soon as the work whistle blew for the "Demolition Platoon," the whistle of Weitang Commune on the opposite bank also sounded immediately. The "Demolition Platoon" filled seventy ponds along the North Ting River with river mud, and the Weitang Commune followed suit, hauling river mud into the ponds along the South River, one boatload after another. These two rivals in the competition also sent people across the bridge from time to time to visit and learn from each other, chasing and catching up, not yielding an inch.

    There are many heroes in the "South Heavenly Gate." The Huang Jiguang Assault Team and the Zhao Yiman Assault Team also refused to give way to each other in the competition. The ten members of the Zhao Yiman Assault Team had four digging soil and six pushing carts. They loaded quickly and ran fast, ensuring the supply needed for composting fertilizer. When turning, they flexibly rotated the switching track, like railway workers throwing switches, both fast and accurate. The young men of the Huang Jiguang Team mixed one layer of grass and one layer of mud in the large ponds, stirring evenly and thoroughly to ensure high fertilizer quality. That day, after dinner, the two assault teams went to the construction site by coincidence. As darkness slowly fell, the members of the two teams were still happily transporting soil and composting fertilizer. The Huang Jiguang Team shouted: "We can't lose to the girls!" The Zhao Yiman Team raised their voices even higher: "We must beat the young men!" It was a truly fierce competition. They had already completed the quota of 350 dan of composting fertilizer per person per day, but no one was willing to stop work. The party branch secretary of the brigade rushed to the construction site and persuaded everyone for a long time before finally convincing them, agreeing to fight again tomorrow.

                    "Top" Character Couple
    Early in the morning, before the night had completely faded, a newly married couple from the First Production Team of the Sixth Brigade of the Shengze People's Commune in Wujiang County were already wearing raincoats and carrying iron spades out to accumulate fertilizer. They were the first to get up every day, the first to finish breakfast, and the first to go to work. The commune members called them the "Top" character couple. In the fertilizer accumulation movement, this newly married couple set up a challenge to all the members of the production team, guaranteeing to accumulate 2,500 dan of fertilizer per person in the eight days before the Spring Festival. In four days, they had already accumulated 2,800 dan of fertilizer between them. This couple had been married for less than ten days, and their beautiful story of loving labor had already made it into the county newspaper. The county newspaper introduced that on their wedding day, the groom Yan Liujin said to the bride:

    "You should rest at home tomorrow. I can't accompany you. These days, our Communist Youth League members are carrying out a shock campaign to defend the commune's title."

    The bride, Fu Na, said:

    "Why do you only plan for me? Are Communist Youth League members the only ones allowed to be active? If you can't accompany me, then let me accompany you!"

    "The new bride is going to the fields on the first day; people will laugh at you!"

    "Then the new groom is going to the fields on the first day; won't people laugh at him?"

    The groom, Yan Liujin, didn't know how to persuade her.

    In another room, the old couple were also not asleep. They were talking happily about the new bride. The old man, Yan A'si, said:

    "These days, the team is busy with the shock campaign, and we have another good worker."

    His wife said:

    "Although the shock campaign is important, the newly married couple should rest for a few days."

    "Look at you, I'm afraid you can't keep them here even if you try."

    The next day, as soon as it dawned, the old couple got up and took a look. Ah, the gate was wide open. They hurried to the new house to see, but the son and the new bride were gone. The old couple hurried to the field to look for them, and a warm shout came from afar:

    "Dad and Mom, we are in the plough furrow."

                       Zhuge Liang and Zhao Zilong Combined

    The vast number of cadres are both "Zhuge Liang" and "Zhao Zilong." More cadres participated in labor in this year's fertilizer accumulation movement than last year. They took the lead in finding sources of fertilizer and taking the lead in creating fertilizer in the river. Wherever there were crowds accumulating and creating fertilizer, there were cadres leading the way. The masses said, "Cadres and the masses go into battle together, and fertilizer accumulation becomes more and more vigorous."

    The brigades of the Shengze People's Commune in Wujiang County launched a fertilizer accumulation competition to set up challenges and win red flags. Late at night, Wu Junsheng, the party branch secretary of the Third Brigade, returned home after setting up the challenge. He got up before he had rested for long. He thought that the Sixth Brigade had always done the best in production, and this time he had to surpass them to win the red flag. He groped his way to the river, wanting to set up the waterwheel so that the commune members could start working as soon as they arrived at the construction site in the morning. He had only been there for a short time when he heard footsteps behind him. Looking closer, he saw that it was party member Tian Zhongliang and Youth League member Zhou Qiaona. Wu Junsheng said in surprise:

    "Why are you here so early?"

    Zhou Qiaona replied:

    "Branch Secretary, you're even earlier!"

    They both laughed knowingly, breaking the silence of the early morning.

    The members of the Fourth Production Team of the Sanxing Brigade of the Hengjing People's Commune in Zhenze County rushed to the fertilizer accumulation river early in the morning. The water in the river had already been drained, and a thick layer of ice had formed on the mud. Zhu Shengfu, the fifty-seven-year-old production team leader, was the first to jump into the river, breaking the ice with loud thuds. Then, female commune members Zhu Jinxiu, Hu Jinmei, and others also stood in the black mud, throwing the ice blocks one by one to the riverbank. Each time they threw a block, they let out a burst of victorious laughter. Zhu Shengfu said, "Cold weather freezes lazy people, but we're working so hard that our heads are sweating." Zhu Jinxiu looked up, took off her headscarf, and wiped the sweat from her face, indicating that Zhu Shengfu's words touched her heart.

                     Everyone Carries a Thousand Jin Burden

    In the county towns and rural market towns of the entire special district, a vigorous fertilizer accumulation craze has been launched in all walks of life. Large-character posters and large banners such as "Workers and Peasants Are of One Heart, Accumulate More Fertilizer to Support the Rural Areas to Produce 1,000 Jin of Summer Wheat" are displayed everywhere. Wujiang County's Pingwang Bus Station has newly hung a wooden sign with white characters on a red background, which reads: "For fertilizer accumulation for agriculture, please do not urinate or defecate anywhere." After the market closed at noon every day, every household was busy dusting, sweeping garbage, cleaning chimneys, and shoveling dirt from under the eaves. Groups of government officials cleared sewers and dug river silt. Vegetable market workers were busy peeling vegetable skins and collecting the scraps of poultry, vegetables, melons, and fruits. On the streets, people carried and lifted, sending fertilizer to fertilizer piles and manure ponds.

    Sixteen teachers from three primary schools, including Lushe Primary School of the Xinzhuang People's Commune in Changshu County, completed their fertilizer accumulation task of 10,000 dan ahead of schedule and beyond the target. These sixteen teachers shifted the time for grading homework to the evening and took time out during the day to dig a large grassy pond for mud. When they completed the task of accumulating 10,000 dan of fertilizer, although some people had blisters on their hands and others had cracks on their feet, everyone was very happy, happy that they had contributed to the "grain commander's" campaign.

    One Sunday, more than thirty Young Pioneers from the primary school of the Fourth Brigade of the Shengze People's Commune in Wujiang County picked up manure at the Jishui Bridge water conservancy construction site near the school, collecting more than thirty dan of fertilizer in one day. This attracted the attention of the construction site headquarters, and they immediately convened an on-site meeting and took emergency measures. That night, more than forty temporary toilets and ash sheds were set up on the construction site.

                    Traveling Day and Night to Learn from the Advanced

    In the fervent fertilizer accumulation movement, advanced methods and experiences, like the allure of blooming flowers to bees, were quickly spread from commune to commune, and known from county to county, attracting an endless stream of visitors and "students" sent from various places. The chemical fertilizer plant of the Fuqiao People's Commune in Taicang County, which is close to the Yangtze River, is a chemical fertilizer plant that has gone from rudimentary to modern, from rudimentary to advanced, and has achieved outstanding results. Recently, it has received many "students" from various counties in the Suzhou Special District. These "students" traveled day and night to learn the production methods of indigenous chemical fertilizers from this factory. They carefully visited every indigenous furnace and the production process of various indigenous chemical fertilizers in the Fuqiao Chemical Fertilizer Plant. Xue Guangming, a laboratory technician from the commune hospital of Renyang Commune in Changshu County who was transferred to support the production of indigenous chemical fertilizers, carried a chemistry book with him, flipping through it while visiting, meticulously drawing the diagrams of each furnace, and also asking the old workers who built these furnaces to explain. On the eve of his departure from Fuqiao, Xue Guangming raised the questions he had not understood during the visit and asked the technicians in the factory for advice. They talked until late at night.

    Ni Nongguan, a cadre of the supply and marketing cooperative of the Cangshu Commune in Wuxian County, had already visited the Fuqiao Commune once, and this time he asked a bricklayer to come with him to study again. The bricklayer, Liu Shuisheng, was an old technician in his fifties. He excitedly told reporters that when the commune established a cement factory, he was sent out to learn how to build a cement kiln. During the mass steelmaking campaign, he learned how to build small blast furnaces. This time, for the sake of high grain yields, he gloriously participated in the construction of an indigenous chemical fertilizer plant. He said, "You live and learn. Now I'm working hard to make fertilizer. In the future, we won't be able to eat all the grain. At that time, I'll have to go back to my old business of building houses and build high-rise buildings for the commune members."

    春风又绿江南岸
    ——记苏州地区积肥运动
    本报记者　古平　徐文
    “凤凰不落无宝地，高产出在肥田里”。江苏省苏州专区各地人民公社的社员们，正在以二十四分干劲突击积肥，争取实现三麦千斤、水稻再翻一番的跃进指标。
                  英雄大闹“南天门”
    我们首先从苏州出发，到以二十四分干劲名闻全国的常熟县去。一到常熟县，田野里的一溜红旗一溜人，二百多个以英雄人物命名的积肥突击队，开展着热火朝天的你追我赶的积肥竞赛。大红纸写的挑战书、应战书和决心书贴满了田头的黑板，各路突击队的战士评比牌一块块树立在红旗下面。
    这里是常熟县的最南端，常熟人民把这里称为和吴县竞赛的“南天门”。常熟县向苏州全区发出“三麦再赶水稻、水稻再翻一番”的竞赛倡议后，在常熟南边的吴县马上响应，要和常熟比个高低。隔河相望的两个公社——常熟的辛庄公社和吴县的渭塘公社又两下送了战表。
    为了在竞赛中胜渭塘，保擂台，“董存瑞爆破连”接受了光荣的任务，驻守“南天门”。我们访问“爆破连”的那天，满天霏雨。战士们个个披着簑衣，头戴笠帽，像战斗在疆场的全副盔甲的英雄。他们个个赤着脚，把裤管卷到膝上，用那一双双有力的臂膀挥舞着铁?，搅拌着河沟里的碎草和河泥。我们见到了副连长王根生，这是一个年青而快活的人，说起话来满脸笑容。我们问他为什么取“爆破连”这个名字，他告诉我们说，他们连像解放军的爆破英雄那样，哪里最困难就到哪里去，这样就获得了“董存瑞爆破连”这个光荣的命名。这个英雄的连队在近半个月中全力投入了积肥战斗。天寒做出汗，零下十度照常干，他们在雨雪封冻的时候没有一天停止战斗。
    “爆破连”里有个满嘴胡子的老汉也和大家一齐赤脚沤肥，这引起了我们的注意。副连长不是说“爆破连”全是二十来岁的年青人吗，怎么出来个老汉？这位老农似乎看出了我们的肚里话，主动地告诉我们说，他是附近十一队的社员，天天看着这班年青人干得有劲，看得他眼红了，就自动地跑来和“爆破连”一道干。
    “爆破连”上工哨子一吹，对岸的渭塘公社也马上响起哨音。“爆破连”把沿北汀河岸的七十只河塘罱满了河泥，渭塘公社也跟着干起来，往南河沿的河塘里一舱又一舱地上河泥。这两个竞赛中的对手，还时常派人过桥互相参观学习，你追我赶，一步不让。
    “南天门”里英雄多。黄继光突击队和赵一曼突击队在竞赛中也是互不相让。赵一曼突击队十个队员，四个上土，六个推车，装得多，跑得快，保证供应沤肥需要。在转弯时，她们灵活地转动换向轨道，就像铁路工人扳岔道似地既快又准。黄继光队的小伙子们在大塘里一层草一层泥，搅得匀，拌得透，保证沤肥质量高。这天，这两个突击队在晚饭后不约而同地又上了工地，天慢慢黑下来了，两个队的队员们还在欢乐地运土、沤肥。黄继光队喊：不能输给姑娘们。赵一曼队的尖嗓门声音更高：一定要胜过小伙子。真是竞赛得难解难分。他们已经完成了每人一天沤肥三百五十担的定额，大家还不肯歇工。大队的党支部书记赶到工地，磨了好半天嘴皮，才说服了大家，约定明天再战。
                    “头”字号夫妻
    清晨，夜色还没有退尽，吴江县盛泽人民公社六大队第一生产队的一对新婚夫妇已经身披簑衣、掮着铁鎝出门积肥了。他们每天头一个起床、头一个吃好早饭、头一个上工，社员们称他（她）们为“头”字号夫妻。在积肥运动中，这对新婚夫妇向全生产队的社员摆了一个擂台，保证在春节前八天中每人积肥二千五百担。四天中，他们两人已积肥二千八百担了。这对夫妻结婚还不到十天，他们爱劳动的美事已经上了县报了。县报上介绍他们在结婚那天，新郎颜六金对新娘说：
    “明天你在家休息吧，我不能陪你，这几天我们共青团员搞突击，要保公社的擂台。”
    新娘富娜说：
    “你怎么专为我打算，共青团员就准自己积极？你不能陪我，就让我去陪你好了。”
    “新媳妇第一天就下田，人家会笑话你的！”
    “那新郎第一天下地，人家就不笑话啦？”
    新郎颜六金不知怎么样才能说服她。
    在另外一个房间里，老夫妻二人也未入睡，他们正在乐呵呵地谈论着新媳妇。老汉颜阿四说：
    “这几天队里正忙着搞突击，倒又多了一个劳动好手。”
    他的老伴说：
    “突击虽说重要，新婚夫妻总要让他们歇几天。”
    “看你，只怕你留也留不住他们。”
    第二天天刚亮，老夫妻起身一看，啊，大门洞开。赶忙到新房去看，儿子和新媳妇都不见了。老夫妻忙到田边去找，远处传来了亲热的喊声：
    “爹爹妈妈，我们在耖沟呐。”
                       诸葛亮兼赵子龙
    广大干部既是“诸葛亮”又是“赵子龙”，在今年的积肥运动中，干部参加劳动的比去年更多。他们带头寻找肥源，带头下河造肥，哪里有积肥造肥的人群，哪里就有干部在带头干。群众说：“干部群众同出征，积肥越搞越有劲”。
    吴江县盛泽人民公社各个大队开展了打擂台、夺红旗的积肥竞赛。深夜，第三大队支部书记吴俊生打过擂台回家，没有睡多一忽儿就起床了。他想，第六大队的生产一向搞得最出色，这次一定要超过他们才能夺得红旗。他摸黑来到河边，想把水车安置好，等早晨社员一到工地就干起来。他才到不久，就听到身后有脚步声，走近一看，原来是党员田中良和团员周巧娜。吴俊生吃惊地说：
    “你们怎么这样早？”
    周巧娜接口说：
    “支部书记，你还要早呐！”
    他们双方发出会意的笑声，打破了早晨的沉寂。
    震泽县横经人民公社三星大队第四生产队的社员一早赶到积肥河边，河里的水已经车干，稀泥上结了一层厚冰。五十七岁的生产组长朱生富头一个跳下河，澎澎澎地破冰打冻。接着，女社员朱金秀、胡金妹等人也都站到乌泥中，把冰冻一块块地抛到河边上，每抛一块，就发出一阵胜利的欢笑。朱生富说：“冷天冻懒汉，我们干得头上直冒汗。”朱金秀抬起头来，揭下头巾，揩抹脸上的汗水，表示朱生富的话说到她心上。
                     千斤重担大家挑
    全专区的县城和农村集镇上，各行各业都掀起了轰轰烈烈的积肥热潮，“工农人民心连心，多积肥料支援农村三麦产千斤”等大字报、大幅标语琳琅满目。吴江县平望汽车站新挂了一块白底红字的木牌子，上面写着“为农业积肥，请勿随地大小便”。每当中午散市以后，家家户户都在忙着撢灰尘、扫垃圾，刷烟囱、铲千脚泥。机关干部成群结队地通阴沟、挖河淤。菜场工作人员忙着削菜皮、收集家禽和蔬菜瓜果的下脚，大街上挑的挑、抬的抬，把肥料送向肥堆粪塘。
    常熟县辛庄人民公社吕社等三个小学十六个教师提前超额完成积肥任务一万担。这十六位教师，把批改作业的时间移到晚上去做，白天抽出时间挖一个大草塘泥。当他们完成了一万担的积肥任务时，虽然有的人手上起了泡，有的人脚上裂了口，但大家心里都非常高兴，高兴自己为“粮帅”升帐出了力。
    一个星期天，吴江县盛泽人民公社第四大队的小学，有三十多个少先队员到学校附近的吉水桥水利工地上拾粪，一天拾到三十多担肥料。这事引起工地指挥部的注意，他们立即召开现场会议，采取了紧急措施。当晚，工地上就搭起了四十多个临时厕所和灰棚。
                    日夜兼程学先进
    在热火朝天的积肥运动中，先进的方法和经验就像是盛开的鲜花对于蜜蜂的诱力那样，马上会社社相传，县县相闻，吸引来应接不暇的参观者和各地派来的“留学生”。紧靠长江边的太仓县浮桥人民公社的化肥厂是个从土到洋、土中出洋、取得出色成绩的化肥厂，最近就接待了来自苏州专区各县的许多“留学生”。这些“留学生”日夜兼程，赶到这个厂学习土化肥的生产方法，他们仔细地参观了浮桥化肥厂的每一座土炉子和各种土化肥的生产过程。常熟县任阳公社有位从公社医院抽出来支援土化肥生产的化验人员薛广明，随身带着化学书，边参观边翻书，精细地画下每一座炉子的图样，还请砌这些炉子的老工人讲解。离开浮桥的前夕，薛广明把参观学习中没有弄透的问题提出来，向厂里的技术员请教，他们一直谈到深夜。
    吴县藏书公社供销部干部倪农冠已经到浮桥公社参观过一次，这次又请一位泥水工人同来再学习一遍。泥水工人柳水生是个五十多岁的老技工，他非常兴奋地告诉记者说，公社办水泥厂时，他被派出去学砌水泥窑。全民大炼钢铁时，他学会了砌小高炉。这次为了粮食高产，他又光荣地参加了土化肥的建厂工作。他说：“做到老学到老，现在出力搞肥料，将来粮食吃不了，那时，我还得干那盖房子的老本行，给社员们砌高楼大厦哩。”
