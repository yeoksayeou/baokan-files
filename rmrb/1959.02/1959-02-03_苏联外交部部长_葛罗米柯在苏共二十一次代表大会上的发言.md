Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 30th (TASS): The full text of the speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Andreyevich Gromyko at the afternoon session of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on January 29th is as follows:

    Comrades! Comrade Khrushchev's report unfolds before us a clear picture of the Soviet state's great leap forward towards communism. This naturally fills people with pride in the achievements of our party and people, and inspires them to strive with new efforts to reach great goals.

    In the history of our party, in the life of our people, there are many events of great historical significance. However, the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union occupies a special place among these events. This congress marks the entry of our country into a new period of development—a period of comprehensively expanding the construction of a communist society.

    The reason why it has become possible to turn to the execution of the magnificent tasks proposed by the draft Seven-Year Plan is that our party and its Leninist Central Committee, in the period since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, have carried out tremendous organizational work in the rapid development of all sectors of the national economy.

    The achievements of the Soviet Union on all fronts of domestic construction have great international significance. Know that this is a fact: the publication of Comrade Khrushchev's report outline last November was an extremely important event in international life, which had a significant impact on stabilizing the entire international situation. This historical document gave many foreigners more confidence in the future. Even among our enemies, this document aroused surprise and involuntary respect.
　　
    The Seven-Year Plan makes people more convinced that the Soviet Union is a fortress of peace
　　
    The policy of peaceful coexistence has a new and more solid foundation

    People believe that the figures in our Seven-Year Plan once again prove that the Soviet Union loves peace and cares about maintaining lasting peace. Now even those in the West who have been deceived by bourgeois hypocritical propaganda understand a simple fact: a country that is preparing to strive to occupy the first place in the world in the production of industrial and agricultural products within a few years, and to ensure that the living standards of its residents reach the highest level in the world, cannot hope for war; on the contrary, it is a reliable fortress of peace.

    Of course, those who have been hoping for the failure of our plans for forty-one years are now in a panic and cannot hide their unease. They are uneasy because the strengthening of the Soviet economy and the brilliant achievements of our science and technology have made adventurous acts against the Soviet state and other socialist countries even more dangerous, or rather, hopeless for aggressors.

    As for the people of all countries in the world, they welcome our Seven-Year Plan, considering it a great document of the Soviet Union's peace policy. They believe that this document reflects the determination of the Soviet people, who, relying on our endless resources and the unity of the great and unbreakable socialist camp united by a unified will and common ideals, are confidently continuing to advance and defend the cause of peace. All of this is changing the balance of power in the world and giving the policy of peaceful coexistence a new and more solid foundation.

    As everyone knows, the 20th Congress of the CPSU once reached the conclusion that war is not inevitably inevitable, and that it is possible to prevent imperialists from launching wars. This extremely important instruction, which has been confirmed by life, has opened up broad prospects for our country to more actively engage in the struggle to safeguard peace, and has ensured that the foreign policy implemented by the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government has achieved great success. The foreign policy implemented by the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government has never been as proactive and effective as it has been in the three years since the Party's 20th Congress.

    Now, thanks to the achievements of our social system, it has become practically possible to realize people's long-cherished wish: to eliminate the tragic world war in social life, especially when there are destructive weapons today. If the socialist social system brings nothing more to mankind than avoiding the disaster of world war, then this alone already means sounding the death knell for the decadent capitalist system. This knell indicates the historical inevitability of the demise of the capitalist system; it also means the victory of the new social system—socialism and communism.

    The People's Republic of China and other socialist countries in Asia and Europe, together with us, have unswervingly fought for peace and peaceful coexistence. Their active activities have had an increasingly profound impact on the development of the struggle for world peace. In the past three years, we have witnessed the close unity of the socialist camp countries and their close cooperation for peace.

    The foreign policy directions of the two camps are completely opposite
    The peace proposals put forward by the Soviet Union have been rejected by the West

    In the years since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, it can be seen particularly clearly that the foreign policy directions of the socialist camp countries and the capitalist camp countries are completely opposite. This difference is obvious and does not need to be described in detail. Now we will only talk about the main aspects.

    We have repeatedly and firmly suggested to Western countries that they conclude a non-aggression treaty between the two major military groups—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization. We suggested that both sides begin to withdraw troops from foreign territories, "isolate" each other militarily, and establish a nuclear-weapon-free and rocket-weapon-free zone in the "hottest" place at present—Central Europe—the latter being a proposal made by Poland.

    But how did Western countries respond? They didn't even want to listen to any of this. Their answer was to further intensify the patching together of their military groups, plan new military treaties aimed at the Soviet Union, and now these treaties are being imposed on Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan one by one. If they can't be wholesaled, they will be retailed. They are frantically trying to increase American nuclear weapons and rocket weapons bases, and the United States is making every effort to distribute these bases in the territories of countries that depend on it.

    The Soviet Union once suggested holding a high-level meeting to calmly and patiently discuss pressing international issues. However, Western leaders spent a lot of effort and thought to avoid holding such a meeting.

    The Soviet Union has put forward specific proposals on the Berlin issue and the German peace treaty issue. However, Western governments have not yet expressed their willingness to seriously discuss the Soviet proposals, and they themselves have not put forward any relevant proposals in this regard.

    The Soviet Union suggested to Western countries that they conclude an agreement on prohibiting the use of various atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and completely destroy such weapons. The ruling groups of Western countries didn't even want to listen to this. The leaders of the United States and Britain were even unwilling to stop the testing of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, which the people of all countries have long firmly demanded and which the Soviet Union has been calling for for many years.

    The Soviet Union suggested that Western countries negotiate on the issue of using outer space for peaceful purposes only, prohibiting the use of rocket weapons, and abolishing foreign military bases. This proposal was also rejected by the ruling groups of Western countries.

    This is what we see now when we discuss our country's magnificent plans for further development—the two lines of international policy on the current major issue—the issue of preventing the threat of nuclear war.

    Western countries' foreign policy completely lacks a sense of reality
    They always hope to turn back the wheel of historical development

    Of course, we all know that the current foreign policy direction of the major countries in the capitalist world is not accidental. This direction is not something new. It reflects that some powerful groups in Western countries are still unwilling to give up, always hoping to turn back the wheel of historical development.

    For example, the stubborn unwillingness of the United States and some other Western countries to "recognize" obvious facts such as the existence of the People's Republic of China and the existence of the German Democratic Republic can only show that their foreign policy completely lacks a sense of reality. However, the leaders of Western countries will probably regret continuing to adopt this attitude towards the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic in the future. There may come a day when the US and British governments will have to ask People's China and the German Democratic Republic to sit at the same table with them.

    The Western countries' policy towards Germany most prominently illustrates the characteristics of their foreign policy direction. The Potsdam Agreement and other agreements of the Allied countries on the German issue clearly stipulated that German militarism and Nazism should be eradicated, and their revival should be prevented forever. But what is the actual situation?

    The three major Western powers—the United States, Britain, and France—not only did not eradicate German militarism, but instead opened the door to the restoration of the material foundation of German militarism—West Germany's military-economic potential. The smelting furnaces in the Ruhr are once again smelting steel for the manufacture of weapons, and first of all for the manufacture of weapons. As before, the leading positions in the Federal Republic of Germany are still occupied by the monopoly organizations that once kept Hitler and the Nazi Party.

    If the governments of the three Western powers are still loyal to the letter and spirit of the Potsdam Agreement, they have an obligation to promote the end of the increasingly rampant revanchist propaganda in the Federal Republic of Germany. But some decision-makers in the United States, Britain, and France prefer to pretend that they don't see this. The alliance between the US, Britain, France, and West Germany is extremely despicable and shameful. Atomic armament will not bring good results to West Germany itself.

    There are many words that can be used to accurately assess these behaviors of the United States, Britain, and France. But, no matter what words are used, even the most moderate ones, the act of consistently destroying the common oath made in blood and concluding military agreements with former enemies against one's own comrades will be considered despicable and shameful.

    Not only that, but Western countries have also begun to equip the Bundeswehr of West Germany with atomic weapons and rocket weapons. None of the neighbors of the Federal Republic of Germany possess such weapons, and the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are already preparing to hand over these weapons to West German militarists.

    There is no doubt that those neighbors of the Federal Republic of Germany who have been repeatedly victimized by German militarist aggression will not stand idly by to the atomic armament of West Germany, and they will definitely take corresponding measures to safeguard their own security. What will be the consequences of this? The leaders of the Federal Republic of Germany should consider this issue before taking decisive steps in atomic armament.

    Needless to say, everyone is clear that the danger of war in Europe has greatly increased, and atomic armament will not bode well for the Federal Republic of Germany itself. If rocket devices aimed at corresponding targets are installed on both sides along the border of the Federal Republic of Germany, will the residents of West Germany feel safe? Of course not, even if only from the geographical location of West Germany.

    In addition, even one of the most rampant and arrogant revanchists, the Minister of Defense of the Federal Republic of Germany, Strauss, probably would not dare to deny that the city of West Germany farthest from the Soviet Union is much closer to the moon.

    Of course, if the West German revanchists regard the Soviet Union's opposition to the nuclear armament of the Bundeswehr as the Soviet Union's fear of this armament, then they are completely deceiving themselves. Presumably, the former Hitler generals and officers, including Strauss, who barely escaped in Stalingrad back then, should have learned something. The Soviet Union opposes the atomic armament of the Federal Republic of Germany because it is incompatible with the interests of peace, and first of all with the interests of peace in Europe. It is hoped that those in Western Europe who are still indifferent to this today can also understand the danger of the Federal Republic of Germany's atomic armament plan.

    Unfortunately, it cannot be said that the national leaders of the Federal Republic of Germany have shown the ability to soberly assess the situation. Their atomic mania is even more serious than that of the representatives of other countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A reliable symptom of this disease is the publication of war-mongering remarks and the obstruction of international cooperation. The question arises here, it seems that some national leaders in West Germany are either hopelessly or seriously infected with some kind of atomic virus.

    As long as there is a glimmer of hope for improvement in the international situation, Adenauer will come out again. He quickly comes out first to oppose every new proposal aimed at easing international tensions, especially easing tensions in Europe. It must be frankly admitted that the process of West Germany awakening from the frenzy of aggressive war is extremely slow.

    No one is more hostile to peaceful coexistence than West German leaders
    Revanchists should not forget Hitler's shameful end

    The leaders of the Federal Republic of Germany apparently intend to first arm West Germany well, and then begin to realize their ambitions and impose their own conditions for a unified Germany and conditions for concluding a peace treaty on others. Therefore, Bonn is exerting pressure on its North Atlantic Treaty Organization partners, forcing them to take the most stubborn stance on any initiative that can lead the world onto the path of cooperation. In these plots, the following calculation occupies a certain position, which is to use and incite contradictions, so that the major powers conflict with each other, and then take advantage of their disputes and conflicts to profit from them.

    Perhaps it is difficult to find another country in the world, or more precisely, its leaders, who are as hostile to the principle of peaceful coexistence as West Germany. Does the fact that the Federal Republic of Germany has not established diplomatic relations with any socialist country other than the Soviet Union not explain many problems? What's more, the government of the Federal Republic of Germany has even included the unwillingness to establish diplomatic relations with socialist countries in its formal creed of foreign policy. However, it is the Federal Republic of Germany that suffers the most from this strange position, and, regrettably, Prime Minister Adenauer and his ministers do not see this.

    The government of the Federal Republic of Germany does not shy away from saying that the decisive factor in this policy is the territorial ambition towards certain countries, in other words, the demand to revise the borders. You see, they have bills in their pockets that they plan to present to other countries, but they have forgotten that the era of Hitler's plunder has long passed.

    The West German revanchists will never forget that before Hitler's Germany surrendered in 1945, it had established other borders not by relying on law, but by relying on force. If these revanchists hope to measure the losses and disasters suffered by the people of all countries due to World War II, then can the people of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, France, and other countries that were once attacked by Hitler's bandits not present their own supplementary and truly justified bills for this war? Have the bloody atrocities committed by German militarists been completely paid for? In any case, it cannot be said that they have finally redeemed their crimes, although the Soviet people do not like to bear grudges, although they do not regard the Germans as permanent enemies, and although the mood of revenge is incompatible with our country's policies.

    Mentioning all of the above is not to revive old ambitions, but to put the facts in their proper place. If all these bills and counter-bills, ambitions and counter-ambitions are put together in the boiling pot of a new war, then do the revanchists not understand what the result will be? It can be guaranteed that if the West German militarists provoke a war, then they will be presented with two bills: one is the bill for new crimes, and the other is the bill for the old crimes of Hitler's Germany, because many of the West German militarists claim to be the heirs of Hitler's Germany. Do those activists in West Germany who seem to be caught in a whirlpool and are determined to take Hitler's old path want to end up like this? Concluding a peace treaty is an important step in solving the German problem. West German militarists' aggressive intentions cannot be concealed.

    It is best not to touch the serious wounds that the Soviet people still feel today.

    The question is this: either atomic armament of the Bundeswehr, which in fact means implementing a policy of launching a war even if it is covered up with various verbal and written guarantees; or adjusting the German issue so that West Germany cannot become a source of war danger. To this end, a peace treaty with Germany must first be concluded. Concluding a peace treaty means taking an important step in solving the task of German reunification, because this helps the two Germanys reach an agreement. Without such an agreement, German reunification is empty talk.

    People in the United States and Britain, and even some French people, are trying to comfort the Soviets with the following statement: they say that they—our former allies—are now with West Germany, and they have signed the Paris Agreement with West Germany, as if this agreement can stop the aggressive intentions of West German militarists. But, if the purpose of the Paris Agreement is really to not allow West Germany to become a source of new war danger, if Washington, London, and Paris really have this intention, then why are they unwilling to sign a peace treaty with Germany that is precisely pursuing this goal?

    As for the guarantees of "restraining" West Germany, that is not of great value. Wilson, Lloyd George, and Clemenceau all said the same, or almost the same. Their successors also said this when establishing the Locarno Treaty system. As is well known, the basis of this system was: to form an alliance between Western countries and Germany, and the inner calculation was to make Germany turn to attack the Soviet Union. But it was not long before Germany gradually tore up the Treaty of Versailles, and at the same time overturned the Locarno Treaty, which was considered at the time to be a masterpiece of diplomatic ingenuity by the British and French governments. Experience shows that the Versailles, Locarno, and Munich conspiracies are all shameful signs of the same historical process, and the result is the graves of millions of victims of World War II, countless cities turned to ashes. All of this is a silent witness to the tragic experience not long ago.

    Experience proves that it is difficult to prevent a jackal from eating meat. Almost the same, it is difficult to believe the good words of German militarists, and now they don't even have a good word. Of course, it is wrong to equate them with the West German people, because the West German people are increasingly clearly seeing that the realistic path to German reunification and Adenauer's path are completely different. The former path leads Germany to revival, making it a peaceful and democratic country; while the latter leads West Germany to destruction. Dulles' war threats cannot scare the Soviet people. If they dare to launch a war, they will suffer an unprecedented defeat.

    Today, the most important issue is to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and abolish the occupation system in West Berlin. Our proposals on this issue are well known to everyone. Unfortunately, Western countries oppose these proposals. The reason why they oppose them is that the situation formed by the failure to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and the continued presence of the occupiers in West Berlin is a dangerous focus of the "Cold War". This focus is used to intensify international tensions, especially tensions in Europe, expand military industries, increase the pressure of taxes, and increase the profits of monopoly organizations that manufacture munitions. It is precisely those who pursue this policy who are not interested in the Soviet government's proposals for a peace treaty with Germany and on the Berlin issue, because they are afraid that these measures will prove the bankruptcy of their policy. But those who are afraid of these measures are those who are preparing for war, not those who are defending peace.

    Two days ago, when US Secretary of State Dulles talked about the above-mentioned proposals of the Soviet government at a press conference, he could not think of a better way than to adopt a war threat that was not very well disguised. But as a responsible national leader, one should carefully consider one's words and not speak rashly. I would like to advise Mr. Dulles not to adopt the method of threats. If he can scare anyone with this threat, then it is definitely not the Soviet Union and the Soviet people. Dulles cannot be unaware that threatening war is one thing, and launching a war is another. Whoever embarks on this fatal path will bear full responsibility for its consequences. As for the ending, there is only one, that is, the defeat of the aggressor, and an unprecedented defeat.

    No one can blame the Soviet Union for not seeking a way to solve the problem of the German peace treaty and the Berlin problem on the basis of an agreement between the major powers. The Soviet Union will continue to do everything possible to strive to reach such an agreement, and is willing to negotiate with Western countries on this point, even starting today. However, if such an agreement on the German peace treaty cannot be reached not because of our fault, then the Soviet Union and other socialist countries will seek another way to solve this problem.

    The same should be said about the Berlin problem. If a unanimously agreed solution to this problem, which our country sincerely desires, cannot be found, then the Soviet Union will implement the established measures on the Berlin problem, which everyone knows, in accordance with the agreement reached with the German Democratic Republic. It is hoped that no one will miscalculate on this point. Western countries' foreign policy and treaty mania have gone bankrupt. The idea of peaceful coexistence is becoming increasingly mature. There are increasingly wider people in the world who recognize that Western countries' foreign policy and their treaty mania have gone bankrupt. Those who are still clinging to this policy are some people who are afraid of the future, some people who have lost confidence in their own strength and in the ability of their own social system.

    In the West, including the United States, it is not without reason that books reflecting the inevitable demise of the capitalist system are appearing one after another in order to support the current foreign policy expressed by the formula of "brink of war." Two years ago, a book by George appeared in Paris with a resounding title called "The Era of the Future and the Movement of History." The author predicts that "modern civilization" will be destroyed, and even points out the date of destruction: around 2080!

    The work of Professor Hook of New York University shows how hopelessly the modern imperialist ideological system has become in analyzing international relations. He advocates an absurd idea: that human destruction is better than the victory of communism. John Bernal wrote in his recently published book that a British lord even came up with a special formula in this regard: "Atomization is better than communization." At the same time, please note that he believes that the first step in "communization" is precisely the prohibition of atomic weapons!

    The spokespersons of the social system that is withdrawing from the historical stage are now resorting to the most barbarous means of destruction that people have ever possessed. But the foundation on which the planners of the arms race and war preparation are trying to build their policy mansion is collapsing under their feet.

    In Western countries, including the United States, the idea that countries with different social systems must coexist peacefully is becoming increasingly mature. In some regions, this idea has already emerged. The trend of demanding to solve outstanding international issues through negotiations is becoming increasingly obvious. It is not surprising that this is the case.

    We all know that the Central Committee of our Party and the Soviet government welcome these trends, and are ready to meet these trends at any time. Improving relations with the United States is of particular importance. The Soviet side is prepared to work to build Soviet-American relations on a solid foundation of mutual trust and peaceful cooperation. Comrade Mikoyan's visit to the United States, which has just ended, proves that there is a considerable force in the United States that hopes to improve relations with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union firmly grasps the initiative in international affairs and will continue to steadfastly defend the cause of world peace.

    Comrades, since the existence of the Soviet state, the Soviet Union's influence on international affairs, the Soviet Union's prestige as a great socialist power and a fortress of peace, has never been as great in the hearts of people around the world as it is today. The period from the 20th Congress of our Party to the current 21st Congress is a glorious and brilliant period in the hearts of the Soviet people. This period has opened up unprecedentedly broad space for the development of the mighty forces contained in the socialist system. Our country's foreign policy is also a manifestation of these forces.

    Many bourgeois activists in the West do not shy away from saying that they do not like the fact that the Soviet Union takes one diplomatic action after another; that the Soviet Union firmly grasps the initiative in international affairs, and constantly puts forward proposals that are supported and supported by the people of all countries. But, may I ask, since this initiative of the Soviet Union is in line with the vital interests of the Soviet people and is fully in line with the interests of peace, why does the Soviet Union not show this initiative?

    The objective favorable conditions created by the nature of the Soviet social system itself for the Soviet Union's foreign policy should of course be used well, and should not be hidden and not used. But there are also some people who are devoted to the other side, thus bringing losses to the Party and the people. The anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov attempted to change our country's foreign policy in this regard, which not only caused great losses to our country's domestic construction, but also to the Soviet state's foreign policy. Our Party and its Leninist Central Committee cleared away these factional activists, and cleared the way for the most creative, flexible, and active Soviet state policy that is fully in line with the interests of our people.

    Comrades! You are clearly aware that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its Presidium, and Comrade Khrushchev himself, constantly pay great attention to the issues of the international situation, and specifically and creatively guide our country's foreign policy. This ensures that our foreign policy now and in the future is in line with the interests of our people—the builders of communism; the Soviet Union will continue to steadfastly defend the cause of peace; we Soviet people (workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals) will continue to firmly hold high the invincible banner of communism, under which they will not only achieve new victories in the country, on the economic construction and cultural construction fronts, but also achieve new and more significant achievements in freeing mankind from the threat of war.

### 苏联外交部部长  葛罗米柯在苏共二十一次代表大会上的发言

专栏：

    苏联外交部部长
    葛罗米柯在苏共二十一次代表大会上的发言
    新华社1日讯　塔斯社莫斯科1月30日电：苏联外交部长安·安·葛罗米柯同志在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会1月29日下午会议上的发言，全文如下：
    同志们！赫鲁晓夫同志的报告在我们面前展开了苏维埃国家向共产主义大踏步前进的清晰图景。这自然会使人们对我们党和人民所取得的成就感到骄傲，并鼓舞人们以新的努力争取达到伟大的目标。
    在我们党的历史中，在我国人民的生活中，有不少具有伟大历史意义的事件。但是，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会在这些事件中占有特殊地位。这次代表大会标志着我国进入一个新的发展时期——全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期。
    转入执行七年计划草案提出的宏伟任务之所以成为可能，是由于我们党及其列宁主义的中央委员会在苏共第二十次代表大会以后这段时期中，在急剧发展国民经济各部门方面进行了巨大的组织工作。
    苏联在国内建设各个战线上的成就具有重大的国际意义。要知道这是事实：去年11月赫鲁晓夫同志报告提纲的公布是国际生活中极重要的事件，它对稳定整个国际局势起了显著的影响。这个历史文件使不少外国人士对未来更加有了信心。甚至在我们的敌人当中，这个文件也引起了惊讶和情不自禁的尊敬。
　　七年计划使人更确信苏联是和平堡垒
　　和平共处政策有了新的更巩固的基础
    人们认为我国七年计划的数字再一次证明苏联热爱和平，苏联关心维护持久和平。现在甚至西方那些被资产阶级虚伪宣传迷惑住的人也明白了这样一个简单的事实：一个准备在若干年内争取使工农业产品生产占世界第一位，并且保证居民生活达到世界最高水平的国家，不可能希望战争，相反地它是和平的可靠堡垒。
    当然，四十一年来一直希望我们的计划失败的那些人现在慌作一团，并且掩饰不住自己的不安。他们所以感到不安，是因为苏联经济的增强以及我国科学技术的辉煌成就，使得对苏维埃国家和其他社会主义国家进行冒险成为更加危险的事了，更确切地说，成为侵略者无望的事情了。
    至于世界各国人民，他们欢迎我们的七年计划，认为这个计划是苏联和平政策的伟大文件。他们认为这个文件反映了苏联人民的决心，苏联人民依靠我国无穷尽的资源，依靠由统一意志和共同的理想联合起来的、伟大的、牢不可破的社会主义阵营的团结，正满怀信心地继续前进，捍卫和平事业。这一切正在改变世界力量的对比，并且使和平共处的政策有了新的更加巩固的基础。
    大家知道，苏共第二十次代表大会曾经得出这样的结论：战争不是注定不可避免的，有可能防止帝国主义者发动战争。生活所证实的这一极其重要的指示为我国更加积极进行维护和平的斗争开辟了广阔的前景，并且保证了苏共中央和苏联政府所执行的外交政策获得很大成就，苏共中央和苏联政府所执行的外交政策从来也没有像党的第二十次代表大会后这三年中那样主动和有成效。
    现在由于我们社会制度取得了成就，这就使得有了实际的可能来实现人们的夙愿：在社会生活中杜绝悲惨万状的世界大战，特别是在有了现在的毁灭性武器的时候。如果说，社会主义社会制度除了避免世界大战灾难外没有再给人类带来什么东西，那末单是这一点就已经意味着是对腐朽的资本主义制度敲起了丧钟，这个钟声说明资本主义制度灭亡的历史必然性；同时也意味着新的社会制度——社会主义和共产主义的胜利。
    中华人民共和国和欧亚两洲的其他社会主义国家同我们一道始终不渝地为和平与和平共处而斗争，它们的积极活动对争取世界和平斗争的发展产生日益深刻的影响。在过去的三年中，我们亲眼看到了社会主义阵营各国的紧密团结和它们为和平而进行的亲密合作。
    两个阵营的外交政策方针完全相反
    苏联提出的和平建议均被西方拒绝
    在苏共第二十次代表大会以后的这几年中，可以特别清楚地看到社会主义阵营各国和资本主义阵营各国外交政策方针是完全相反的。这种区别一目了然，无需详尽叙述。现在我们只谈一下主要方面。
    我们曾不止一次坚决地向西方国家建议缔结两个主要军事集团——北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约组织的互不侵犯条约。我们建议双方着手从外国领土上撤军，彼此在军事上“隔离”，在目前气氛“最热”的地方——中欧——建立无核子武器和火箭武器区，后者是波兰提出的建议。
    可是西方国家是怎样回答的呢？它们对这一切连听都不想听。它们的回答是进一步加紧拼凑自己的军事集团，策划新的、矛头指向苏联的军事条约，现在这种条约正在被东一个西一个地强加到伊朗、土耳其、巴基斯坦的头上，不能批发，就来零售。它们狂热地企图增加美国核武器和火箭武器基地，而美国则竭力把这些基地分布在依赖于它的国家的领土上。
    苏联曾经建议召开高级会议来心平气和地和耐心地讨论迫切的国际问题。然而西方国家的领导人却花费不少力气和心思逃避召开这种会议。
    苏联曾经就柏林问题和对德和约问题提出了具体的建议。然而西方国家政府目前还没有表示愿意认真讨论苏联的建议，它们自己也没有在这方面提出任何相关的建议。
    苏联向西方国家建议缔结关于禁止使用各种原子武器和氢武器的协议，并且完全销毁这种武器。西方国家的统治集团对这一点连听也不想听。美国和英国的领导人甚至不愿意停止原子武器和氢武器的试验，而这是各国人民很久以来所坚决要求的、也是苏联多年来一直呼吁的问题。
    苏联建议西方国家就宇宙空间只用于和平目的问题、禁止使用火箭武器和取消外国军事基地问题进行谈判。这项建议也被西方国家的统治集团拒绝了。
    这就是现在当我们讨论我国进一步发展的宏伟计划时所看到的在当前重大问题——防止核战争威胁问题上国际政策的两条路线。
    西方国家外交政策完全缺乏现实感
    它们总希望能使历史发展车轮倒转
    当然，我们大家都知道，资本主义世界主要国家当前的外交政策方针并不是偶然的东西。这种方针也不是什么新鲜事。它反映了西方国家某些有势力的集团还不死心，总希望能使历史发展的车轮倒转。
    例如，美国和西方其他一些国家顽固地不愿意“承认”中华人民共和国的存在和德意志民主共和国的存在这样一些明显的事实，这只能说明它们的外交政策完全缺乏现实感。但是，西方国家的领导人对中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国所继续采取这种态度将来恐怕要感到后悔的。可能有这么一天，美国和英国政府不得不请人民中国和德意志民主共和国同它们坐到一张桌子上来。
    西方国家对德国的政策最突出地说明了它们的外交政策方针的特点。波茨坦协定和盟国其他关于德国问题的协定都曾明文规定，要根除德国军国主义和纳粹主义，永远防止它们的复活。而实际上怎样呢？
    西方三个大国——美国、英国和法国不但不去根除德国军国主义，反而为德国军国主义的物质基础——西德军事经济潜力的恢复大开方便之门。鲁尔的冶炼炉又在冶炼制造武器的钢，而且首先是为了制造武器。和从前一样，德意志联邦共和国的领导职位仍然由那些曾经豢养过希特勒和纳粹党的垄断组织所占据。
    如果三个西方大国的政府仍然忠于波茨坦协定的条文和精神，它们就有义务来促使结束在德意志联邦共和国越来越猖獗的复仇主义的宣传。但是美国、英国和法国的一些国家决策人却宁愿装出一副他们没有看见这一点的样子。美英法与西德结盟的做法极卑鄙可耻原子武装对西德本身也不会有好结果
    有很多词汇可以用来准确地评定美国、英国和法国的这些行为。但是，不管用什么样的、甚至是最温和的词汇，一贯破坏用鲜血结成的共同誓约、同从前的敌人缔结军事协定来反对自己的战友的行为都会被认为是卑鄙的和可耻的。
    不仅如此，西方国家还着手用原子武器和火箭武器来装备西德的联邦国防军。德意志联邦共和国的邻国中没有一个拥有这种武器，而北大西洋公约组织的领导人已经在张罗把这种武器交给西德军国主义者。
    毫无疑问，曾不止一次亲身受过德国军国主义侵略之害的那些德意志联邦共和国的邻国，对西德进行原子武装是不能袖手旁观的，它们一定会采取相应的措施来保障自己的安全。这样会导致什么样的结果呢？德意志联邦共和国的领导者们在进行原子武装方面采取决定性的步骤之前，应当考虑一下这个问题。
    不消说，大家都清楚，在欧洲发生战火的危险性大大地增加了，而原子武装对德意志联邦共和国本身来说，是不会预兆有任何好结果的。如果说沿着德意志联邦共和国的边境，从两面都设置上瞄着相应目标的火箭装置，那么西德的居民难道会感到安全吗？当然是不会的，即使仅仅从西德的地理位置来考虑也是不会的。
    此外，甚至最猖狂和嚣张的复仇主义者之一德意志联邦共和国国防部长施特劳斯，大概也不敢否认：离苏联最远的西德的城市同月球比起来要近得多。
    当然，如果西德复仇主义者把苏联反对联邦国防军的核武装看作是苏联害怕这种武装，那就完全是自己欺骗自己。按说，前希特勒的将军和军官们，其中也包括当年在斯大林格勒勉强得以逃生的施特劳斯在内，应当学到点东西。苏联反对德意志联邦共和国的原子武装，是因为它同和平的利益、首先是同欧洲和平的利益不相容的。但愿西欧那些在今天还对这一点漠不关心的人也能了解到德意志联邦共和国原子武装计划的危险性。
    遗憾的是，不能说德意志联邦共和国国家领导人表现出清醒地估计局势的能力。他们的原子狂热症，甚至比北大西洋公约组织其他国家的代表人物更厉害，这种病的可靠症状是发表煽动战争的言论和阻挠国际合作。这里产生一个问题，看来，西德的某些国家领导人若不是不可救药地、那么也是严重地染上了某种原子病毒。
    只要国际局势出现一线好转的希望，阿登纳就又出来了。他赶紧第一个出来反对每一个旨在缓和国际紧张局势，特别是缓和欧洲紧张局势的新建议。必须坦率地承认，西德从侵略战争的狂热中清醒的过程是极端缓慢的。
    没有人比西德领导人更敌视和平共处
    复仇主义者别忘记希特勒的可耻下场
    德意志联邦共和国的领导人显然是打算先把西德好好地武装起来，然后着手实现自己的野心并把自己的统一德国的条件和缔结和约的条件强加给别人。因此，波恩则对它的北大西洋公约组织的伙伴施加压力，迫使它们对于能把世界引上合作道路的任何倡议都将采取最顽固的立场。在这些谋划中，下面的算盘占有一定的地位，就是要利用和煽动矛盾，使各大国互相冲突，再利用它们的纠纷和冲突而从中渔利。
    也许，世界上再难找到另一个国家，更正确一点说，它的领导人，像西德这样敌视和平共处的原则。除了苏联以外，德意志联邦共和国没有同任何一个社会主义国家建立外交关系，难道这一事实不是说明很多问题吗？更何况德意志联邦共和国政府竟把不愿意同社会主义国家建立外交关系这一点列入了它的外交政策的正式信条。但是，由于这种奇怪的立场而受害最大的倒是德意志联邦共和国，而且，遗憾的是，阿登纳总理和他的部长们都看不到这一点。
    德意志联邦共和国政府并不讳言，在这种政策中起决定作用的是对某些国家的领土野心，换句话说，就是要求修改疆界。你们看，他们口袋里装着打算向其他国家提出的账单，却忘记了希特勒掠夺的时代早已过去了。
    西德复仇主义者无论如何不会忘记，希特勒德国在1945年投降以前，曾经不是依靠法律，而是凭借武力确立了另外的国界，如果这些复仇主义者希望衡量一下各国人民由于第二次世界大战而遭到的损失和灾难，那么难道苏联人民以及波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫、法国和其他曾经遭到希特勒匪徒进攻的国家的人民就不能就这次战争提出自己补充的、真正有根据的账单么？难道德国军国主义者犯下的血腥暴行已经完全偿清了么？无论如何不能说，他们已经最后赎回了他们的罪行，尽管苏联人民是不喜欢记仇的，尽管他们不把德国人看作是永久的敌人，并且报复情绪是同我国的政策格格不入的。
    提到上述一切并不是为了使旧的野心复活，而是为了把事实摆在应有的地位上。如果把所有这些账单和反账单、野心和反野心一齐放在新战争的开水锅里，那么复仇主义分子就不明白那会得到怎样的结果吗？可以保证，如果西德军国主义者挑起了战争，那么他们面前就会摆着两张账单：既有新罪行的帐单，也有希特勒德国旧罪行的账单，因为西德军国主义者中有许多人自称是希特勒德国的继承人。西德的那些像是卷进了漩涡样的一心想走希特勒老路的活动家，是不是想落到这样的下场？缔结和约是解决德国问题重要步骤西德军国主义者侵略意图掩饰不了
    最好还是不要去触动苏联人民直到今天还感觉得到的严重的创伤。
    问题是这样的：或者是原子武装联邦国防军，这样做即使用种种口头的和书面的保证掩盖起来，事实上还是意味着执行发动战争的政策；或者是调整德国问题使西德不可能变成战争危险的根源。为此，首先必须缔结对德和约。缔结和约就意味着在解决德国统一的任务方面迈出重要的一步，因为这有助于使两个德国达成协议，不达成这样的协议，德国的统一便是一句空话。
    美国和英国的人士，甚至某些法国人都企图用下面这样一种说法来安慰苏联人，他们说，他们——我们的前同盟者——现在同西德是一伙的，他们已经同西德签订了巴黎协定，似乎这种协定能够制止西德军国主义者的侵略意图。但是，如果巴黎协定的目的真的在于不允许西德变成新战争危险的策源地，如果华盛顿、伦敦和巴黎的确有这个意图，那末，为什么他们不愿签订正是追求这个目的的对德和约呢？
    至于谈到“约制”西德的保证，那是没有什么大的价值的。威尔逊、劳埃德—乔治和克雷蒙梭都曾经说过同样的、或者几乎同样的话。他们的继任者在建立罗迦诺协定体系时也这样说过。如所周知，这个体系的基础就是：使西方国家和德国结成联盟，而内心的打算是使德国转而进犯苏联。可是没有过多久，德国就一步一步地撕毁了凡尔赛条约，同时也推翻了当时被认为是英法政府外交智谋的杰作的罗迦诺协定。经验表明，凡尔赛、罗迦诺和慕尼黑的阴谋都是同一个历史进程中的可耻的标志，其结果就是千百万第二次世界大战的牺牲者的坟墓，无数化为灰烬的城市，这一切就是不久前悲惨的经历的无言的见证人。
    经验证明，要豺狼不吃肉是很难办到的。几乎同样，要相信德国军国主义者的好话，也是难以办到的，而且现在他们连一句好话也没有。当然，在他们和西德人民之间划上等号是错误的，因为西德人民越来越清楚地看到，达到德国统一的现实道路和阿登纳的道路是迥然不同的。前一条道路是把德国引向复兴，使它成为一个和平民主的国家；而后者则是把西德引向毁灭。杜勒斯的战争威胁吓不倒苏联人民如敢发动战争必遭史无前例的失败
    今天最重要的问题是缔结对德和约和废除西柏林的占领制度。我们在这个问题上的建议大家都知道得很清楚，遗憾的是，西方国家反对这些建议。他们所以反对，是因为没有缔结对德和约和占领者继续驻留在西柏林所形成的局面是“冷战”的危险焦点，这个焦点被利用来加剧国际紧张局势、特别是欧洲的紧张局势，扩张军事工业，加重捐税压力，增加制造军火的垄断组织的利润。正是奉行这种政策的人才对苏联政府提出的缔结对德和约和关于柏林问题的建议不感兴趣，因为他们害怕这些措施会证明他们政策的破产。但是害怕这些措施的，只是准备战争的人，而不是保卫和平的人。
    两天前，美国国务卿杜勒斯在记者招待会上谈到苏联政府的上述建议时，除了采取掩饰得很不美妙的战争威胁以外，再想不出更好的办法了。但是作为负责的国家领导人，应该好好斟酌斟酌自己的话，而不应该轻率地乱说。我想劝告杜勒斯先生不要采取威胁的办法，如果他用这种威胁也能吓倒什么人的话，那末绝对不是苏联和苏联人民。杜勒斯不会不知道，用战争来威胁是一回事，发动战争是另一回事。谁要走上这条致命的道路，谁就要为它的后果负全部责任。至于谈到结局，那只有一个，就是侵略者的失败，而且是史无前例的失败。
    谁也不能责备苏联没有在各大国达成协议的基础上寻求解决对德和约问题和柏林问题的途径。苏联今后也将尽一切可能争取达成这种协议，并且愿意同西方国家就这一点进行谈判，那怕今天就开始也行。但是，如果并非因为我们的过错而未能达成这种关于对德和约的协议时，那么苏联和其他社会主义国家将要寻求解决这一问题的另外办法。
    关于柏林问题也应该这样说。如果不能找到我国真诚渴望的对这个问题的一致同意的解决办法，那末，苏联将按照同德意志民主共和国达成的协议，实行大家知道的关于柏林问题的既定措施，希望谁也不要在这一点上打错算盘。西方国家的外交政策和条约狂已破产要求和平共处的思想越来越趋于成熟世界上有越来越广泛的人承认，西方国家的外交政策同它们的条约狂都已破产了，尽管还有人死抓住这种政策不放。死抓住这种政策不放的是一些害怕未来的人，一些对自己的力量、对自己的社会制度的能力丧失信心的人。
    在西方，为了支持用“战争边缘”这一公式所表达的目前的外交方针，一本接着一本地出现反映资本主义制度必遭灭亡的著作，这不是没有原因的。两年前巴黎出现了乔治写的一本书，书名挺响亮，叫作“未来的时代和历史的运动”。作者预言“现代文明”要遭到毁灭，甚至指出了毁灭的日期：大约在2080年！
    纽约大学胡克教授的著作表明了现代帝国主义思想体系在分析国际关系时落到多么不可救药的地步。他鼓吹一种荒谬的思想：人类毁灭胜于共产主义胜利。约翰·贝尔纳在他不久前出版的书中写道，有一个英国勋爵甚至在这方面想出了一个专门的公式：“原子化比共产主义化好”。同时请注意，他认为“共产主义化”的第一步恰恰是禁止原子武器！
    正在退出历史舞台的社会制度的代言人，现在诉诸人们所曾经掌握的最野蛮的毁灭手段。但是军备竞赛和备战的策划者企图借以建立他们的政策大厦的基础却正在他们的脚下倒塌。
    在西方国家，其中包括美国，认为不同社会制度的国家必须和平共处的思想越来越成熟，在某些地区，这种思想已经显露出来，要求通过谈判来解决悬而未决的国际问题的趋向越来越明显了，这是不奇怪的。
    我们大家都知道，我们党中央委员会和苏维埃政府欢迎这些趋向，而且准备随时迎接这些趋向。改善同美国的关系具有特别重大的意义。苏联方面准备努力使苏美关系建立在互相信任和和平合作的牢固基础上。米高扬同志刚刚在美国结束的访问证明，美国国内有着希望改善同苏联的关系的相当大的力量。苏联在国际事务中牢牢地掌握着主动将继续坚定不移地捍卫世界和平事业
    同志们，从苏维埃国家存在以来，苏联对国际事务的影响，苏联作为一个伟大的社会主义强国与和平的堡垒的威望，在全球各地人民的心目中，从来没有像今天这样大。从我们党的第二十次代表大会到目前的第二十一次代表大会这一段时期，在苏联人民的心目中是一个光辉灿烂的时期。这个时期为蕴藏在社会主义制度中的雄厚力量的发展打开了空前广阔的天地。我国外交政策也是这些力量的一种表现。
    西方的许多资产阶级活动家不讳言，他们不喜欢这样的事实：苏联一个外交上的举动跟着一个外交上的举动；苏联在国际事务中牢牢地掌握着主动，不断提出得到各国人民拥护和支持的建议。但是，试问，既然苏联的这种主动符合苏联人民的切身利益，并且完全符合和平的利益，那么苏联为什么不表现这种主动呢？
    对于苏联社会制度的性质本身为苏联外交政策所创造的客观有利条件，当然应该善于加以利用，而不应该藏而不用。但是也有这样一些人，他们倾心于另外一面，因而给党和人民带来了损失。马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布宁加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团企图在这方面改变我国的外交政策，他们不仅使我国的国内建设，而且使苏维埃国家的外交政策受到了很大的损失。我们党及其列宁主义的中央委员会清除了这些派别活动分子，并为完全符合于我国人民利益的最富创造性的、灵活的和积极的苏维埃国家政策扫清了道路。
    同志们！你们清楚地知道，苏联共产党中央委员会及其主席团和赫鲁晓夫同志本人对国际局势问题经常给予极大的注意，并具体地、创造性地指导我国的外交政策。这就保证：我们的外交政策现在和将来都符合于我国人民——共产主义建设者的利益；苏联将继续坚定不移地捍卫和平事业；我们苏联人民（工人、集体农民和知识分子）将继续牢牢地高举着不可战胜的共产主义旗帜，在这面旗帜下，他们不仅要在国内，在经济建设和文化建设战线上取得新的胜利，而且要在使人类摆脱战争威胁方面取得新的更显著的成就。（文内小插题是本报编者所加）（附图片）
