Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 15th. Party activists' meetings have been held across the Soviet Union in recent days to discuss the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Participants in the meetings enthusiastically and realistically studied and formulated production targets for their regions or units. Many meeting participants stated that they are now considering not how to complete the Seven-Year Plan, but how to complete it far ahead of schedule.

    A meeting of party activists was held in the Moscow region on the 13th. Kapitonov, First Secretary of the Moscow Regional Committee, delivered a report at the meeting. The reporter and the participants in the conference unanimously pointed out that during the Seven-Year Plan, the working people of the Moscow region would complete many huge tasks in terms of production mechanization and automation, housing and cultural construction, and the development of transportation and trade. The labor productivity of enterprises will increase by 40% to 50% while reducing working hours. This will allow many funds to be used to meet the growing needs of the working people and further increase wages.

    The meeting focused on discussing ways to realize the Seven-Year Plan in the Moscow region. Speakers pointed out that many enterprises in Noginsk will complete the Seven-Year Plan in five or five and a half years. Agricultural laborers have greatly increased their targets, and meat, milk, and egg production will increase dramatically this year.

    At the Kiev Regional Party Activists Conference, speakers believed that the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had formulated a concrete program for the Soviet people to strive for communism. The meeting comprehensively discussed the issue of further improving the Party's organizational and political work, and formulated specific measures to further improve the economy and culture. The total output of enterprises in the Kiev economic zone will increase by more than 70% in seven years. Speakers at the meeting pointed out that many enterprises will tap their potential and strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan in six years or less. The movement to strive to become communist labor teams is in full swing.

    Podgorny, an alternate member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, emphasized in his report at the Kiev Regional Party Activists Conference that the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union demonstrated the unbreakable unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union around the Central Committee and demonstrated the creative power of Marxist-Leninist thought.

    When talking about the patriotic enthusiasm of the Ukrainian people in striving to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, Podgorny pointed out that the republic's industry and agriculture have great potential to achieve this goal.

    At the Party Activists Conference in Stalinabad, participants pointed out that during the Seven-Year Plan, the government allocated one and a half times more funds to the Tajik Republic for the development of the national economy than in the previous seven years. The resolution unanimously adopted at the meeting pointed out that the Tajik Republic has the potential to complete the industrial production tasks and cotton planting tasks in the Seven-Year Plan in six years, and the milk production tasks in three years. Participants in the Saratov Regional Party Activists Conference emphasized that the state's industrial output would more than double within seven years and the chemical industry production would increase several times. Agricultural laborers in the state decided to triple meat production and increase milk production by half in two or three years. (Attached picture)

    走在建设共产主义事业的最前列
    苏共党员决心为提前完成七年计划而斗争
    新华社莫斯科15日电　苏联各地连日来都在举行党的积极分子会议，讨论苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议。参加会议的人热情高涨地、实事求是地研究并制订出本地区或本单位的生产指标。许多会议参加者表示，现在他们考虑的已不是如何完成七年计划、而是如何大大提前完成它的问题了。
    莫斯科州13日举行了党员积极分子会议。莫斯科州委会第一书记卡皮托诺夫在会上作了报告。报告人和大会的参加者一致指出，莫斯科州的劳动人民在七年计划期间，将在生产机械化和自动化方面、在住宅和文化建设方面、在发展运输业和贸易方面完成许多巨大的工作。企业的劳动生产率在缩减工作日的同时将提高40％至50％。这样做就可以把许多资金用来满足劳动人民日益增长的需要，以及进一步提高工资。
    会议着重讨论了实现莫斯科州七年计划的办法。发言者提出，诺金斯克的许多企业将在五年或五年半的时间内完成七年计划。农业劳动者们都大大提高了自己的指标，今年的肉类、奶类和蛋类生产将要急剧增加。
    在基辅州党的积极分子会议上，发言的人都认为，苏共第二十一次代表大会制订了苏联人民为共产主义奋斗的具体纲领。会议全面讨论了进一步改进党的组织工作和政治工作的问题，并订出了进一步提高经济、文化的具体措施。基辅经济区七年内各企业总产量要增加70％以上。在会上发言的人指出，许多企业都将挖掘潜力，争取在六年或更短的时间内完成七年计划。争取成为共产主义劳动队的运动正在热火朝天地展开。
    苏共中央主席团候补委员波德戈尔内在基辅州党的积极分子大会上作报告时着重指出，苏共第二十一次代表大会显示了苏联共产党围绕在中央委员会周围的牢不可破的团结；表明了马克思列宁主义思想的创造性力量。
    在谈到乌克兰人民争取提前完成七年计划的爱国热忱时，波德戈尔内指出，共和国的工农业有着巨大的潜力，足以达到这一目的。
    在斯大林纳巴德的党员积极分子会议上，与会者指出，在七年计划期间，政府拨给塔吉克共和国发展国民经济的款数，比以往七年内的款数要多一倍半。会议在一致通过的决议中指出，塔吉克共和国有可能在六年内完成七年计划中的工业生产任务和种植棉花的任务，三年内完成奶类生产的任务。萨拉托夫州党的积极分子会议的参加者着重指出，这个州的工业产量在七年内将增加一倍多；化学工业产品产量将增加数倍。这个州的农业劳动者决定在两、三年内使肉类生产提高三倍，奶类生产提高一倍半。（附图片）
