    A Jin Dynasty Stage
    Chang Wenzhai
    Recently, a small stage was discovered in a Jin Dynasty tomb from the second year of the Daan reign (1210 AD) excavated in Houma City, Shanxi Province. The stage was built on the eaves of the main room on the rear wall of the tomb chamber, about 60 centimeters wide, 80 centimeters high, and 20 centimeters deep. Five lifelike statues of actors performing on the stage were found. The person in the center is wearing a red robe, a black gauze hat, and holding a jade tablet. On the left are two people in long robes and crowns standing by his side. The most interesting are the two people on the right. The one closer to the center is wearing red clothes and a tall hat, holding a silk fan in his right hand, leaning to the side and waving his arm, with his knees slightly bent, as if he is dancing gracefully. The one furthest to the right is a chubby, silver-bearded old man, with his hair tied up in a high bun, wearing a yellow short robe, tightly holding his right thumb and index finger in his mouth, and bending over slightly as if whistling. His cheeks are puffed out, and his expression is vivid.
    Our country's drama has a long history of development. In the past, we only studied the history of Chinese drama from some written records and circulated scripts. Some problems were always difficult to clarify. For example, we all know that in the Northern Song Dynasty, the folk theaters were said to be square stage areas enclosed by railings on the ground for performance, called "gou lan" (booths). But when did stages elevated above the ground begin? To solve these problems, finding information from surviving cultural relics is probably a good way. In the past, everyone knew about a mural in the Mingying Wang Temple in Daojue Township, Hongzhao County, Shanxi Province, depicting a Yuan Dynasty zaju (variety play) performance scene, with the inscription "Dahang Sanle Zhongdu Xiu performs here, the 4th month of the first year of Taiding [1324]". However, this painting does not reveal whether the performance took place in an on-the-ground "gou lan" or on a stage elevated above the ground. A few years ago, during a cultural relic survey in Shanxi Province, a small Yuan Dynasty stone tablet was discovered in Jiwang Temple in Taizhao Village, fifteen miles northeast of Wanrong County, Jinan. According to the inscription on the tablet, it can be confirmed that the stage had already formed at that time and was prevalent in rural areas. However, because the original building no longer exists, the structural form of the stage is still unknown. However, the Jin Dynasty stage newly discovered in Houma not only has a performance scene, but also tells us the form of the stage at that time. Moreover, the second year of Jin Daan (1210 AD) is 114 years earlier than the first year of Yuan Taiding (1324 AD), and it can truly be said to be the earliest physical evidence for studying the history of Chinese drama.

    一座金代的舞台
    畅文斋
    最近，在山西侯马市发掘的一座金代大安二年（公元1210年）的墓葬中，发现了一个小舞台。舞台是砌在墓室后壁正屋檐上的，宽约六十公分，高约八十公分，进深约二十公分。台上五个正在表演的演员塑像栩栩如生。当中一个人，身穿红袍，头戴乌纱、手执牙笏。左边是两个长袍冠冕的人在一旁侍立。最有意思的是右边的两个人。靠中间的一个穿红衣裳、戴高帽子、右手拿着一个纨扇，侧身摇臂，两膝微屈，仿佛正在款款而舞的样子。最右边是一个胖胖的银须老者，挽高髻，身着黄色短袍，用嘴紧含着右手的大拇指和食指，微弯着腰正在呼哨。两腮鼓得圆圆的，神气活现。
    我国戏剧已经有很长远的发展历史了。过去，我们只是从一些文献记载和流传的剧本中来研究我国的戏剧史。有些问题总是搞不大清楚。比方说，我们大家都知道在北宋时代的民间戏棚，相传是在平地用栏杆围成一个方形的舞台面来表演，叫做勾栏。但是高出地面的舞台究竟从何时开始呢？要解决这些问题，从遗留下来的文物中来找资料，恐怕是一个很好的办法。过去大家知道在山西洪赵县道觉乡明应王庙内的一幅壁画，画着元代杂剧演出的场面，而且有“大行散乐忠都秀在此作场，泰定元年4月□日”的题记。但是这幅画却看不出究竟是就地“勾栏”，还是在高出地面的舞台上演出。前几年山西省在文物普查过程中，又在晋南万荣县东北十五里太赵村稷王庙发现了一个元代小石碑，根据碑文记载，可以肯定当时舞台已经形成，而且遍及农村。但是因为原来建筑已经无存，所以舞台的结构形式仍不可考。但是侯马新发现的这个金代舞台不仅有演出场面，同时也告诉了我们当时舞台的形式。而且金大安二年（公元年）比元代泰定元年（公元一三二四年）早一百一十四年，实在可以说是目前研究我国戏剧史最早的实物资料了。
