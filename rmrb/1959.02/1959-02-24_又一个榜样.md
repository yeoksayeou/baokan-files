    Another Role Model
    With the help of the Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, Chang'an County in Shaanxi Province formulated five specific measures for the greening management of wheat fields. This is a very good role model.
    We say it is a role model, first of all, because these measures are very specific and thorough, including both ideological work and organizational work; both specific technical requirements, and leadership methods and work methods. Seeing such thoughtful and comprehensive measures, we believe that, coupled with the soaring enthusiasm of the masses in Chang'an, the production increase target can be achieved.
    We say it is a role model because the cadres of Chang'an County received the specific help of Comrade Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, in formulating measures for wheat field management. Now, the masses throughout the county are highly motivated and are actively applying fertilizer, watering, compacting, and harrowing the wheat fields. These facts once again vividly illustrate the importance of the Party Committee Secretary taking the lead in doing a good job in wheat field management. This year's wheat production has many new requirements and new problems, and it is very necessary for the Party Committee Secretary to personally take action, solve problems in a timely manner, and encourage the masses to pool their wisdom and efforts to ensure a bumper wheat harvest.

    又一个榜样
    陕西长安县在省委书记的帮助下，对麦田返青管理拟订了五项具体措施。这是一个很好的榜样。
    说它是一个榜样，首先是因为这些措施十分具体，十分周密，既包括了思想工作，也包括了组织工作；既包括了具体的技术要求，也包括了领导方法和工作方法。看到这样周到而全面的措施，我们相信，加上长安群众冲天的干劲，准可以实现增产指标。
    说它是一个榜样，是因为长安县的干部在制定小麦田间管理措施工作中，得到了陕西省委第一书记张德生同志的具体帮助。现在，全县群众干劲冲天，正积极给麦田追肥、浇水、镇压、耙耱。这些事实再一次生动地说明了党委书记挂帅，对做好麦田管理工作的重要意义。今年小麦生产有许多新要求和新问题，十分需要党委书记亲自动手，及时解决，鼓舞群众群策群力，保证小麦大丰收。
