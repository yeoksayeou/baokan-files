    Seize the Time to Complete the Tasks of Peanut Purchase and Short Floss Cotton Ginning
    By Renmin Ribao Commentator
    Since the central government issued instructions to strive to complete the annual agricultural product purchase tasks before the Spring Festival, Party committees in various regions have further strengthened their leadership over agricultural product purchase work, and many regions have sent a large number of cadres to the grassroots level to assist in the work. Currently, many regions are launching a concentrated purchase campaign in conjunction with central tasks such as rectification of communes and accumulation of fertilizer. The purchase work is being further deepened, and the purchase volume is gradually increasing.

    According to the spirit of the central government's instructions, when carrying out the concentrated purchase of agricultural products, it is necessary to grasp not only the purchase quantity but also the purchase variety. Only by grasping both quantity and variety can we comprehensively complete the agricultural product purchase plan and meet the needs of all aspects of the national economy. From the perspective of purchase varieties, the current peanut purchase and short floss cotton ginning work is still far from completing the entire purchase task, becoming a weak link in the current agricultural product purchase work.

    Peanuts are one of China's important oil crops, and short floss cotton is also an important material. They are closely related to the lives of the broad masses of people and industrial production, and are also important export materials. In order to timely guarantee the needs of all aspects of the national economy, various regions must particularly strengthen the two weak links of peanut purchase and short floss cotton ginning in the current agricultural product purchase. Strive to reverse the slow progress of purchase in the shortest possible time.

    Last year's agricultural production saw an all-round bumper harvest, and peanuts also had a bumper harvest. But why is the purchase progress so slow? According to some survey materials, there are only a few reasons: During last year's autumn harvest, the peanut harvesting work was relatively rough. After the harvest, people's communes, in order to strive for a bumper peanut production this year, generally reserved too much seed. Some communes, in order to improve the canteen meals, also reserved a portion of the peanuts and other oil crops that should have been sold to the state to prepare to extract oil for their own consumption.

    Based on the above situation, to speed up the progress of peanut purchase, the following tasks must be done well. First, various regions should quickly organize another group of people to pick up the peanuts left in the fields as much as possible. For example, the communes in Xushui County, Hebei, have launched the "small autumn harvest" three times, mobilizing elderly commune members and primary school students to go to the fields. The commune gives the harvesters a certain material reward, and the state-owned purchasing stations and stores are responsible for purchasing the peanuts and other agricultural products they pick up. According to recent statistics from several communes in this county, they have picked up more than 36,000 jin of peanuts, as well as a large amount of grain, cotton, sweet potatoes, and other agricultural products. This method greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses. The masses increased their income, and the state also purchased a lot of things. Currently, all regions where spring plowing has not yet begun should seize the time to take similar measures to strive to recover all the peanuts and other agricultural products discarded in the fields.

    Secondly, it is necessary to combine the work of rectifying communes with conducting political and ideological education for the cadres and members of the people's communes. Through education and persuasion, help them improve their understanding, so that they truly understand the principle that partial interests must be subordinate to overall interests, and that partial interests are consistent with overall interests, thereby establishing a "nationwide chessboard" perspective, and making them consciously implement the state's unified purchase policy based on the principle of state before commune. At the same time, we must also educate the broad masses of commune members not to waste peanuts. They must understand that peanuts are valuable oil crops with a wide range of uses, and it is a pity to waste them casually. Moreover, the meals of the members of the people's communes are now much better than before the establishment of the canteens, and not eating peanuts casually has no impact on the lives of the members. If these peanuts are sold to the state, it will not only increase the income of the commune, but also be a great support to the country. The broad masses of commune members should realize that actively selling peanuts and other oil crops to the state is a patriotic act that benefits the state, the commune, and the individual commune members. People's communes should not only ensure the completion of the state's unified purchase task of oil crops on time and with quality, but also encourage the broad masses of commune members to go all out and do a good job in the current production in order to strive to achieve a greater harvest of oil crops this year and provide more oil crops to the state. The experience of many regions has proved that as long as the political and ideological education work is done deeply and thoroughly, the broad masses of cadres and commune members are very willing to sell peanuts to the state. Of course, on the premise of completing the state's unified purchase task of oil crops, the needs of the people's communes for oil consumption should also be appropriately arranged and taken care of. In addition to seizing the purchase of peanuts, commercial departments in various regions should continue to vigorously organize the purchase of other oil crops and wild oil crops to meet the country's needs for oils and fats.

    According to the national plan, 4.5 million dan of short floss cotton needs to be ginned this year. The production of short floss cotton can not only increase the wealth of the country and support the production of chemical industry departments, but also be exported to support the industrial construction of socialist brother countries. Therefore, strengthening the ginning work of short floss cotton has both economic and political significance. However, as of the end of January, the national ginning of short floss cotton only completed about one-tenth of the national plan, which is still far from the needs of the first quarter of the year. Therefore, Party committees in various regions must quickly strengthen their leadership over the ginning work of short floss cotton, and particularly focus on solving the problems of processing power and cotton seed supply. We must adopt the policy of simultaneously advancing cotton ginning and linting, and do everything possible to start all the linting machines as soon as possible, give full play to the potential of the machines, improve operating techniques, and increase the lint output and lint yield. In order to solve the problem of insufficient linting power, various regions should quickly find back the power equipment that was previously diverted for other uses and put it into linting production, based on the principle of overall planning and rational arrangement; and adjust a part of the idle power equipment, or try to transfer a part of the power to linting. In order to solve the problem of cotton seed supply, people's communes and state-owned processing enterprises should adhere to the principle of linting first and then extracting oil, and linting three times. For the cotton seeds produced by the people's communes' ginning factories, the roller gins can also be organized for linting. In short, we should mobilize the masses, do everything possible, and strengthen the linting work.

    Under the correct leadership of Party committees at all levels, great achievements have been made on the agricultural product purchase front in the past three months. It can be believed that, on the basis of last year's bumper agricultural harvest and with the continuous improvement of the political consciousness of the broad masses, as long as we continue to go all out, widely and deeply mobilize the masses, continue to carry forward the down-to-earth and meticulous work style, and specifically solve various practical problems in the work, then we will definitely be able to successfully complete the purchase tasks of peanuts and other agricultural products in a relatively short period of time, and greatly accelerate the ginning work of short floss cotton.

    抓紧完成花生收购和短绒棉剥制的任务
    本报评论员
    自中央指示力争在春节以前完成全年农产品收购任务以后，各地党委都进一步加强了对农产品收购工作的领导，不少地区都派出了大批干部深入基层协助工作。现在许多地区正结合整社、积肥等中心工作开展突击收购运动。收购工作正在进一步深入展开，收购数量也在逐渐上升。
    根据中央指示精神，在突击收购农产品的时候，不仅要抓收购数量，而且要抓收购品种。只有数量、品种同时抓好，才能全面地完成农产品收购计划，才能满足国民经济各方面的需要。从收购品种上来看，当前花生收购和短绒棉的剥制工作距离完成全部收购任务还相差很远，成为当前农产品收购工作中的薄弱环节。
    花生是我国重要的油料作物之一，短绒棉也是一项重要物资，它们和广大人民生活及工业生产的关系十分密切，同时也是重要的出口物资。为了及时保证国民经济各方面的需要，各地在当前农产品收购中，特别要加强对花生的收购和短绒棉的剥制这两个薄弱环节。争取在最短的时间内扭转收购进度迟缓的局面。
    去年农业生产全面大丰收，花生也是丰收。但是为什么收购进展却很迟缓呢？根据一些调查材料来看，不外有以下几个原因：去年秋收的时候，花生的收获工作做得比较粗糙，收获以后人民公社为了争取今年花生生产的大丰收，普遍留种过多，有些公社为了改善食堂伙食，还把一部分应该卖给国家的花生和其它油料也留下来准备自己榨油食用。
    根据上述情况，要加快花生收购的进度，必须做好以下几点工作。第一，各地应当迅速再组织一批力量，尽可能地拣回遗留在地里的花生。例如，河北徐水县公社，先后三次发动年老的社员和小学生到地里搞“小秋收”，公社给收获者以一定的物质奖励，拾回来的花生和其他农产品由国营收购点和商店负责收购。最近据这个县几个公社的统计，就拾回了三万六千多斤花生，还拾回了大量的粮食、棉花、红薯等农产品。这个办法大大鼓励了群众的积极性，群众既增加了收入，国家也收购了很多东西。当前，凡是春耕还没有开始的地区，都应该抓紧时间采取类似的办法，力争把丢弃在地里的花生以及其它农产品全部收回来。
    其次，必须结合整社工作，向人民公社干部和社员进行一次政治思想教育。通过教育说服的方法，帮助他们提高认识，使他们真正了解局部利益必须服从整体利益、局部利益和整体利益相一致的道理，从而树立起“全国一盘棋”的观点，使他们自觉地本着先国家后公社的原则，贯彻执行国家的统购政策。同时还要教育广大社员群众不要再浪费花生。要使他们了解，花生是用途很广的宝贵油料，随便浪费掉是很可惜的。而且目前人民公社社员的伙食比起成立食堂以前已经有了很大的改善，不随便吃用花生对社员生活并没有什么影响，如果把这些花生卖给国家，不但增加了公社的收入，而且对国家也是很大的支援。要让广大社员认识到踊跃地把花生和其它油料卖给国家，是既有利于国家，又有利于公社、有利于社员个人的爱国行为。人民公社不仅应该按时按质保证完成国家规定的油料统购任务，而且应该鼓励广大社员群众为争取实现今年油料更大的丰收，为国家提供更多的油料而鼓足干劲，搞好当前的生产。不少地区的经验证明，只要政治思想教育工作做得深做得透，广大干部和社员群众是十分乐意把花生卖给国家的。当然，在完成国家对油料统购任务的前提下，也应该适当地安排和照顾人民公社对油料食用的需要。各地商业部门除了抓紧对花生的收购以外，还应该继续大力组织其它油料和野生油料的收购，以满足国家对油脂的需要。
    根据国家计划，今年需要剥制短绒棉四百五十万担。生产短绒棉，不仅可以为国家增加财富，支援化学工业部门的生产，而且能够出口，支援社会主义兄弟国家的工业建设。因此，加强短绒棉的剥制工作，既有经济意义，又有政治意义。但截至1月底为止，全国短绒棉的剥制才只完成了国家计划的十分之一左右，距离国家第一季度的需要还相差很远。因此，各地党委必须迅速加强对短绒棉剥制工作的领导，特别要突出地抓紧解决加工动力和棉籽供应问题。要采取轧花、剥绒同时并进的方针，想尽一切办法尽快地将剥绒机全部开动起来，充分发挥机器潜力，改进操作技术，提高出绒量和出绒率。为了解决剥绒动力不足的问题，各地应该根据统筹兼顾合理安排的原则，把过去挪作别用的动力设备迅速找回来，投入剥绒生产；并调剂一部分闲置的动力设备，或者设法增调一部分动力来剥绒。为了解决棉籽供应问题，人民公社和国营加工企业都应该坚持做到先剥绒然后再榨油，而且要剥三道绒。对于人民公社轧花厂生产的棉籽，也可以组织皮辊机进行剥绒。总之应该发动群众，想尽一切办法，加强剥绒工作。
    在各级党委的正确领导下，三个多月来在农产品收购战线上已经取得了巨大成绩。可以相信，在去年农业大丰收的基础上，在广大群众政治觉悟不断提高的情况下，只要我们继续鼓足干劲，广泛深入地发动群众，继续发扬踏实而又细致的工作作风，具体地解决工作中的各种实际问题，那么，我们就一定能够在较短的时间内胜利地完成花生和其它农产品的收购任务，并大大地加快短绒棉的剥制工作。
