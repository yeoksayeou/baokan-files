Xinhua News Agency, February 27th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly Trusteeship Council has been holding meetings for several consecutive days since the 23rd to continue discussing the future of Cameroon.

    Cameroon People's Union Chairman Moumié stated at the meeting on the 26th that the elections in French Cameroon were conducted under the threat of bayonets. Therefore, all working people and other resident strata of Cameroon demand new elections.

    Democratic Women's Union of Cameroon representative Vandam said that some groups are attempting to divert world public attention from the urgent demands of the Cameroonian people and have stirred up cries of a "communist threat" in Africa, which does not exist at all. She said this is an old trick of the colonialists, who cling to the principle of "divide and rule." She said the best way to achieve complete independence for Cameroon is to hold a referendum under democratic and completely free conditions.

    Mukoko-Mokeba spoke on behalf of the Cameroonian Students Union in the United States. He exposed the hypocrisy of the British and French Trusteeship authorities in Cameroon.

    At the meeting on the 25th, Cameroon Unification Party representative Ntumazah pointed out the undemocratic conclusions of the United Nations Cameroon Investigation Team, which was manipulated by the United States. He said that the residents of British Northern Cameroon, disregarding the decisions of the local government, demanded that the country be unified into one nation. He emphasized that the government of French Cameroon, headed by Ahidjo, cannot represent the majority of the residents of this region.

    The just demands of the Cameroonian people have received the full support of representatives from Asian and African countries. Iraqi representative Adnan Pachachi suggested at the committee on the 23rd that new elections be held in French Cameroon under the supervision of the United Nations before the trusteeship over French Cameroon is cancelled. News reports say that representatives from Guinea, Liberia, Tunisia, and other countries also spoke at a meeting of Asian and African representatives on the 24th, supporting the holding of new elections in this trusteeship territory.

    Representatives from France, Britain, the United States, French Cameroon, and British Cameroon authorities opposed the establishment of a unified Cameroonian state in their speeches.

    The United States delegation issued a statement on the 24th saying that it supports the report of the United Nations Investigation Team and opposes holding new elections in French Cameroon. News reports say that the United States is now gathering some other countries to draft a proposal similar to the resolution passed by the United Nations Trusteeship Council, aimed at splitting Cameroon and keeping both parts of Cameroon under British and French control. News reports say that the United States is doing this because it has reached a secret understanding with Britain and France: the United States supports the colonialist stance of Britain and France, and Britain and France, in turn, allow the United States to enjoy "preferential rights" in Cameroon economically.

    联大托管委员会继续讨论喀麦隆问题
    喀麦隆人民代表要求独立统一
    美国支持法英殖民主义立场
    新华社27日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会托管委员会23日以来连日举行会议，继续讨论喀麦隆的前途问题。
    喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米埃在26日的会议上发言说，法属喀麦隆的选举是在刺刀的威胁下进行的，因此，喀麦隆的全体劳动人民以及其他居民阶层都要求重新选举。
    喀麦隆民主妇女联盟代表万德姆说，某些集团企图转移世界公众对喀麦隆人民迫切要求的注意力，在非洲掀起了根本不存在的“共产主义威胁”的叫嚣。她说，这是抓住“分而治之”原则不放的殖民主义者的老把戏。她说，使喀麦隆达到完全独立的最好方法是在民主和完全自由的条件下举行公民投票。
    穆科科—莫克巴代表喀麦隆留美学生联合会发言。他揭露了喀麦隆的英法托管当局的伪善面目。
    在25日的会议上，喀麦隆统一党代表恩图马礼指出了由美国操纵的联合国喀麦隆调查团的结论的不民主。他说，英属北喀麦隆的居民不顾当地政府的决定，要求把全国统一成一个国家。他强调说，以阿希乔为首的法属喀麦隆政府不能代表这个地区的大多数居民。
    喀麦隆人民的正义要求，受到亚非国家代表的全力支持，伊拉克代表阿德南·帕查奇23日在委员会上建议在取消对法属喀麦隆的托管以前，在联合国的监督下在那里举行新的选举。有消息说，几内亚、利比里亚和突尼斯等国代表也在24日亚非国家代表举行的一次会议上发言，支持在这个托管领地中举行新选举。
    法国、英国、美国、法属喀麦隆和英属喀麦隆当局的代表在发言时反对建立统一的喀麦隆国家。
    美国代表团24日发表声明说，它支持联合国调查团的报告，反对在法属喀麦隆举行新的选举。有消息说，美国现在正在纠集其他一些国家草拟一个类似联合国托管理事会通过的决议那样的、目的在于分裂喀麦隆和使喀麦隆两部分继续受英法控制的提案。有消息说，美国这样做是因为它同英法两国已达成秘密谅解：美国支持英法两国的殖民主义立场，英法两国则在经济上允许美国在喀麦隆享受“优惠权利”。（附图片）
