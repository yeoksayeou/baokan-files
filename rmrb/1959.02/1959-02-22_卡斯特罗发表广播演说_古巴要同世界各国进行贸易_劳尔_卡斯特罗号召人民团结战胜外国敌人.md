    Castro Delivers Radio Address
    Cuba to Trade with All Countries
    Raúl Castro Calls on People to Unite and Defeat Foreign Enemies
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 21st—Cuban Prime Minister Castro delivered a radio address on the 19th, advocating that the Cuban government should trade with all countries in the world and hopes to maintain equal relations with all countries that respect Cuba. It is reported that U.S. Senator Ellender recently threatened Cuba with measures aimed at reducing U.S. imports of Cuban sugar.
    Castro said: "We should sell sugar to those who need to buy it. If the Russians need sugar, we will sell it to them. If China needs sugar, we can sell sugar to China." Castro emphasized that now "we have the right to decide our own issues."
    In his speech, Castro accused U.S. Senator Ellender of putting pressure on Cuba by reducing sugar imports from Cuba. He said, "I hate this approach. If they (the United States) want to buy sugar, let them buy it. If they don't want to, we will sell it to others." News reports say that Ellender has expressed strong opposition to the current way the United States imports Cuban sugar. In the past, nearly half of Cuba's sugar production was sold to the United States, and the two countries had signed agreements on sugar prices.
    Castro criticized the so-called Organization of American States. He said, "I don't believe in the Organization of American States. This organization cannot solve any problems. It only interferes in some small-scale wars, but it is of no use to the people of the Americas." Castro said that the United States' appointment of Philip Bonsal as the U.S. Ambassador to Cuba is "a good sign." But he emphasized, "I hope he is not here to threaten us."
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 20th (TASS)—Cuba's "Hoy" newspaper reported on February 17th, "Currently, counter-revolutionaries are operating secretly, attempting to create obstacles for the government, economically sabotage the government, and thus stifle the revolution."
    The report said that the U.S. policy of reducing sugar imports from Cuba, the active and passive resistance of foreign and local large landowners to land reform, and the refusal of large capitalists to pay taxes to the government are all "means by which counter-revolutionaries are putting pressure on the new Cuban government."
    According to reports, Raúl Castro, Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Armed Forces, recently said that those who once opposed Cuban national heroes José Martí and Maceo are merely using a different language from the enemies who are now opposing us: the former enemies spoke Spanish, and today's enemies speak English. Raúl Castro called on workers, farmers, and the revolutionary army to strengthen their unity and fight against these enemies, who are even more formidable than dictatorships. He said that without this unity, it would be impossible to defeat this new enemy, and if the revolution does not crush this enemy, then new Batistas and Machados may reappear in the future.

    卡斯特罗发表广播演说
    古巴要同世界各国进行贸易
    劳尔·卡斯特罗号召人民团结战胜外国敌人
    新华社21日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴总理卡斯特罗19日发表广播演说，主张古巴政府应同世界上一切国家进行贸易，并且希望同所有尊重古巴的国家保持平等关系。据报道，美国参议员埃伦德不久前用旨在减少美国进口古巴糖的措施来威胁古巴。
    卡斯特罗说：“我们应该把糖卖给需要购买的人。如果俄国人需要糖，我们就卖给他们。如果中国需要糖，我们可以把糖卖给中国。”卡斯特罗强调说，现在“我们已经有权利来决定我们自己的问题”。
    卡斯特罗在演说中指责美国参议员埃伦德用减少进口古巴糖来对古巴施加压力。他说，“我讨厌这一套，如果他们（美国）要买糖，就让他们买，如果他们不要，我们就卖给别人”。消息说，埃伦德曾表示坚决反对目前美国进口古巴糖的那种方式。在过去，古巴糖产将近一半是卖给美国的，两国并且签订过有关糖价的协定。
    卡斯特罗批评所谓美洲国家组织。他说，“我不相信美洲国家组织，这个组织什么问题也解决不了。它只会干涉某些小规模的战争，但是对美洲的人民丝毫没有用处。”卡斯特罗说，美国任命菲利普·邦沙尔为美国驻古巴大使是“一个好的征象”。但他强调说，“我希望他不是来威胁我们”。
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社纽约20日讯：古巴“今日新闻报”2月17日报道，“目前反革命正在暗中活动，企图给政府制造障碍，在经济上破坏政府，从而窒息革命。”
    消息说，美国正在实行的减少从古巴输入食糖的政策、外国和当地大土地所有主对土地改革的积极和消极的抵抗以及大资本家拒绝向政府缴税等，都是“反革命对古巴新政府施加压力的手段”。
    据报道，古巴武装部队总司令劳尔·卡斯特罗最近说，从前曾经反对过古巴民族英雄何塞·马蒂和马塞奥的那些人，跟现阶段又来反对我们的这些敌人仅仅是说话的语言变了：从前的敌人讲西班牙语，今天的敌人们是讲英语。劳尔·卡斯特罗号召工人、农民和革命军队加强团结一致同这些比独裁统治更为厉害的敌人作斗争。他说，没有这种团结，就不能战胜这一新的敌人，而如果革命不粉碎这一敌人，那末将来就有可能再次出现新的巴蒂斯塔和马查多。
