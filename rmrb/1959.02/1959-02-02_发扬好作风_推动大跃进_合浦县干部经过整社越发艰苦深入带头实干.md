Promote Good Work Style and Advance the Great Leap Forward
Hepu County Cadres Become More Dedicated and Practical After Rectification of Communes

(Southern Daily News) After carrying out the movement to rectify and consolidate the people's communes, the work style and methods of cadres at all levels in Hepu County, Guangdong Province, have been further improved.

In the past year, cadres at all levels in Hepu County promoted a fine work style of being hardworking and thorough, taking the lead in production, being down-to-earth and working diligently, and following the mass line in the Great Leap Forward in industry, agriculture, etc. More than 2,000 cadres throughout the county fought alongside the masses, ate and lived together, and led commune members in various tasks while engaging in labor, as well as conducting large-scale experimental fields, which won the praise and love of the masses. After the realization of people's communes, the vast majority of cadres continued to maintain this fine work style, but a small number of cadres developed some complacency and relaxation due to the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward last year. In terms of work methods, some cadres also failed to keep up with the rapid development of the situation. Under these circumstances, the Hepu County Party Committee leadership deeply realized that although the shortcomings in the cadres' work style were only localized, the new situation of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959 required an even greater leap forward in the cadres' work style. Therefore, since late December of last year, in conjunction with the movement to rectify and consolidate the people's communes, inspections and evaluations of cadres' work style have been carried out throughout the county, so that the cadres' work style has been further improved.

In rectifying the cadres' work style, the communes focused on commending good cadres, setting up examples, and on this basis, carrying out evaluations, inspections, and conducting criticism and self-criticism, so that the cadres could correctly treat their achievements and shortcomings, feel comfortable, and make quick and good corrections. For example, when 141 cadres above the group leader level in the Shuiwei Management District of the Shikang Commune inspected their work style, they first evaluated the good ones, and commended 83 cadres who had been able to be hardworking and thorough, take the lead in production, be down-to-earth and work diligently, consult with the masses on everything, and maintain a firm stand for a long time. Chen Caizuo, the Party Branch Secretary of the Gaoshugen Production Team, who performed particularly well, was taken as an example for all cadres in the management district, and a movement to learn from Chen Caizuo was launched. On this basis, criticisms and inspections were carried out. In this way, some cadres whose work style was not solid enough and who participated in less productive labor accepted criticism and quickly corrected their shortcomings in a comfortable mood. According to the evaluation and inspection in the rectification of cadres' work style, about 70% of the cadres at all levels in the county who have performed well, have a good work style, and have good work methods over a long period of time have been commended. Some cadres whose work style was not solid and thorough enough, and a small number of cadres with major problems in their work style, quickly realized their shortcomings and quickly overcame them after the evaluation or criticism and education of cadres' work style.

At present, more than 2,200 grassroots cadres throughout the county have generally directly participated in productive labor, and some cadres have also gone deep into canteens and kindergartens to serve as nursery workers and health workers. The participation of cadres in productive labor and their concern for the lives of the masses have greatly promoted the work. Among the more than 2,000 canteens in the county, there were originally 912 that ate in the open air. Because the cadres went deep down to assist in solving the problem, the phenomenon of eating in the open air was quickly eliminated. In addition, 1,500 canteens that originally had fewer dishes have also achieved diversification of dishes. In early January, when the cold wave struck, the cadres generally took the lead in mobilizing, leading more than 130,000 commune members to do a good job in preventing and resisting the cold. Nearly 7,000 new cattle sheds were built, and more than 360,000 cattle coats were rushed to be made. Pigs, winter crops, etc. were also well protected and safely survived the cold wave. Other work such as accumulating fertilizer, deep plowing the land, and water conservancy construction has been done even better than in the previous stage. The cadres continue to participate directly in labor, and the masses have responded very well, posting many big-character posters to commend them.

The fine work styles of being hardworking and thorough, working diligently, and fully promoting democracy are also being continued throughout the county. Some of the main commune cadres who were relatively busy with meetings, handling daily affairs, and staying above for a period of time have gone deep into the grassroots. Lu Zhenzong, the first secretary of the Party Committee of the Gongguan Commune, stayed above more often in the past and was often busy with meetings, and was unable to grasp the situation below. Recently, because he went deep down, he was able to quickly understand the situation and solve problems in a timely manner. For example, when he recently went deep into the Beijie Production Team, he found that the phenomenon of pig deaths was quite serious. He studied with the cadres and commune members and checked that the main reason was the unsound management system and the weakening of the responsibility system. He immediately assisted in solving the problem, and further investigated the situation of the entire commune, and found that many production teams also had similar phenomena. Therefore, the commune immediately took measures to improve the responsibility system and sent animal husbandry veterinarians to quickly treat sick pigs and stop the phenomenon of pig deaths. Because the cadres fully promoted democracy, many difficulties and problems could also be quickly resolved. Many cadres in the Lianzhou Commune said, "Relying on the masses in everything makes every task easier to do." In the early stage of carrying out garden field work in the Luojiang Production Team of this commune, because the cadres neglected to consult with the masses, it took a considerable period of time to figure out how to gradually realize the garden field of the sea? field (mainly how to improve the acidity and alkalinity of the sea? field soil). Recently, due to the full promotion of democracy and joint consultation with the masses, the commune members proposed that in addition to digging ditches, planting trees, and building roads around the field, large ditches should also be dug in the middle of the field, which can not only drain alkali and acid, but also be used for boats, transporting seedlings, and transporting grain. This suggestion was quickly accepted by the management district, and because the commune members were very enthusiastic, the task of digging ditches was basically completed in a short period of time.

    发扬好作风　推动大跃进
    合浦县干部经过整社越发艰苦深入带头实干
    据南方日报消息　经过开展整顿和巩固人民公社运动，广东省合浦县各级干部的工作作风和工作方法有了更进一步的改进。
    过去一年，合浦县各级干部在工、农业等大跃进中，发扬了艰苦深入、带头生产、踏实苦干、走群众路线等优良的工作作风，全县二千多名干部同群众战斗在一起，吃住在一起，边劳动边领导社员群众进行各项工作，以及大搞试验田等，获得了群众的赞扬和爱戴。人民公社化实现后，绝大多数干部继续保持着这种优良的工作作风，但是也有一小部分干部，由于去年大跃进获得巨大成绩，因而就产生了一些自满松气的情绪。在工作方法上，由于形势发展很快，有些干部也赶不上去。在这情况下，中共合浦县委领导上深深认识到：尽管干部作风上存在的缺点只是局部性的，而1959年更大更好更全面的跃进新形势，则要求干部作风也要来个更大的跃进。为此，从去年12月下旬以来，结合整顿和巩固人民公社运动，在全县范围内进行了干部作风的检查、评比，使干部作风得到进一步的改进。
    在整顿干部作风时，各公社着重表扬好的干部，树立榜样，并在这基础上开展评比、检查，开展批评与自我批评，这就使干部们能正确的对待成绩和存在的缺点，心情舒畅和改得快改得好。如石康公社水尾管理区一百四十一个组长以上的干部在检查作风时，首先进行评比好的，对其中八十三个长期能艰苦深入、带头生产、踏实苦干和遇事和群众商量以及立场坚定的干部进行了表扬，把其中表现特别好的高树根生产队党支部书记陈才作，作为全管理区干部的榜样，开展学习陈才作的运动。在这基础上，又开展了批评、检查。这样，一些作风不够踏实、少参加生产劳动的干部，都心情舒畅地接受批评和迅速改正了缺点。根据整顿干部作风中的评比、检查，全县各级基层干部中，长期来表现好，作风好，工作方法好的约占70％，这大批干部都受到了表扬。一些工作作风不够踏实深入，和少数作风上毛病较大的干部，经过干部作风的评比或批评教育后，也很快认识到自己的缺点，迅速加以克服。
    目前，全县二千二百多个基层干部，普遍直接参加了生产劳动，部分干部还深入到食堂、幼儿园当保育员、卫生员。干部参加生产劳动，并关心群众生活，对工作起了很大的推动作用。全县二千多个食堂，原来还有九百一十二个露天吃饭的，由于干部深入下去协助解决，因而迅速消灭了露天吃饭的现象；另有一千五百个原来菜色较少的食堂，也都做到吃菜多样化了。1月上旬寒潮来袭，干部们普遍带头出动，带领十三万多社员做好了防寒抗寒，单是牛棚就新搭起近七千座，赶制好牛衣三十六万多件；对猪只、冬种作物等也保护得好，安全地度过了寒潮。其他工作如积肥、深翻土地、水利建设等，都比前段做得更出色。干部继续直接参加劳动，群众的反映很好，贴了很多大字报进行表扬。
    艰苦深入、踏实苦干、充分发扬民主等优良作风，也在全县范围内继续发扬着。有一段时间比较多地忙于开会、处理日常事务、停留在上面的部分公社主要干部，都深入下层了。公馆公社党委第一书记吕振宗，过去较多地停留在上面，和经常忙于开会，对下面的情况摸不到底。最近以来，他由于深入下去，既能迅速摸清情况，又能及时解决问题。如最近他深入北界生产队时，发现生猪死亡现象相当严重，和干部、社员共同研究，检查出主要原因是管理制度不健全、责任制削弱等，就马上协助解决，并进一步摸清全公社的情况，结果发现许多生产队也有类似现象。于是，公社立即采取措施，健全责任制，并派畜牧兽医等迅速医治病猪，制止生猪死亡现象。干部们由于充分发扬了民主，许多困难和问题也能迅速得到解决。廉州公社许多干部说：“事事依靠群众，项项工作都更容易做了。”这个公社螺江生产队在进行园田化工作的初期，由于干部忽视了和群众商量，拖了相当长时期都没有想出海?田如何逐步实现园田化的办法（主要是如何改良海?田土质的酸性和碱性），最近，由于充分发扬了民主，做到和群众共同商量，结果，社员提出；除了四周开沟、植树、筑路等以外，还要在田中间开大沟，既可排碱排酸，又可驶船、运秧、运粮等。这个建议很快就被管理区接纳，并且由于社员劲头很大，短时间内就基本完成挖沟等任务了。
