Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: According to "Pravda" report: Shvernik, Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, delivered a speech at the 21st Congress of the CPSU on the morning of February 2nd. The full text is as follows:

    Comrades, as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union convenes its 21st Congress, it is more united than ever before, its connection with the people is extremely close, and it is confidently advancing towards its ultimate goal—the complete victory of communism in our country. Now, the Soviet Union has achieved historically significant achievements in various aspects of economy and culture. In the process of our country's great socialist transformation, industry and agriculture have flourished vigorously, culture has prospered, and the material well-being of the people has improved.

    The Soviet national economy has developed at a high speed in the past few years.
    Accumulating strength for building the material and technical foundation of communism.

    The high growth of the national economy has not only quantitatively but also qualitatively accumulated strength for building the material and technical foundation of communism. Thanks to the Party Central Committee's consistent implementation of the Party's Leninist general line and the selfless labor of our people, the power of the Soviet state has been further strengthened, and its international prestige has been increasing day by day. The Soviet Union has become a powerful socialist country with a highly developed economy, technology, and advanced science and culture.

    In the past few years, our country's socialist industry has been developing in a straight upward direction, at a speed unprecedented in capitalist history. While implementing Lenin's general line of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, the Party has also carried out tremendous work in rapidly improving all sectors of agriculture in the past five years. This is the unprecedented struggle for grain, through which we procured 3.5 billion poods of grain in 1958. The reclamation of 36.5 million hectares of wasteland has played a significant role in this regard. It is precisely this that has led to a sharp increase in grain yields and a great development in animal husbandry.

    In addition to the development of industry and the upsurge in agriculture, we have also almost doubled the production of consumer goods compared to 1940. In our country, the material well-being and cultural level of the people are constantly improving. The actual income of workers and staff has almost doubled, and the actual income of farmers has increased by more than double. The transition to a shortened workday is being smoothly implemented, the welfare and support for workers and staff have been improved, and the task of meeting the housing needs of the working people is being vigorously addressed.

    The Party and the government are deeply concerned about further developing socialist culture, improving secondary and higher education, combining education with production practice, cultivating professional cadres, and further developing science. The Soviet Union ranks first in the world in terms of cadre training. Soviet scientists, engineers, and workers are adding glory to the motherland with outstanding new scientific and technological discoveries. In human history, the Soviet Union was the first to build an atomic power station, an atomic icebreaker, and launch artificial satellites. The launch of a multi-stage cosmic rocket that became an artificial planet in the solar system is a triumphant song of Soviet science and technology and the genius of the Soviet people.

    The Party has opened up new paths for building a communist society.
    Made new contributions to Marxist-Leninist theory.

    The great achievements of our people in building the material and technical foundation of communism are the result of the tremendous growth of the socialist economy, the high technical level of industry, and flourishing science, technology, and culture achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party and its Leninist Central Commitee. (Applause)

    Our Party has achieved remarkable success because it follows the instructions of V.I. Lenin, correctly identifies the most urgent and pressing tasks of the moment, and concentrates the strength of the working people and the entire people to solve them. In solving the great tasks of developing the country's economy and culture, the Communist Party has opened up new paths for building a communist society and enriched Marxist-Leninist theory with experience. The resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU and the resolutions of several subsequent Central Committee Plenary Sessions, such as the resolutions on reforming the management of industry and construction, on reforming machine and tractor stations and further developing and consolidating the collective farm system, on the results of agricultural development and further increasing agricultural production, and on further developing the national education system, have had a positive impact on economic and cultural construction and have become new contributions of our Party to Marxist-Leninist theory.

    The Soviet people are bravely pioneering the road to the future. They are leading the way in scientific and technological progress and constantly achieving new and remarkable successes in consolidating the Soviet socialist system. Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev plays an outstanding role in solving the great tasks of building the material and technical foundation of communism in the Soviet Union.

    Relying on the unlimited support of the masses and their creative initiative, our Party mobilizes the Soviet people to strive for a new and tremendous upsurge in the socialist economy, culture, and material well-being of the working people.

    The anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov, which has now been exposed and ideologically crushed, once prevented the Party from completing this task. This factional group attempted to undermine the Party's measures to improve the allocation of productive forces, further develop agriculture, and adjust the management of industry and construction. The Malenkov anti-Party group tried to undermine the Party's general line on all extremely important issues and attempted to undermine the unity of our Party's ranks.

    Life has mocked the factional elements of the Malenkov anti-Party group and has confirmed that the measures taken by our Party to safeguard the interests of the Soviet people are correct. Our Party follows the Leninist principles of policy and is good at finding the right solutions at all turning points in history. The Party has always won victories because of its loyalty to Leninism, its loyalty to the unity and solidarity of the Party's ranks. The strength of our Party lies in its close ties with the masses, taking into account the experience of the people, timely meeting the pressing needs of the masses, and being good at discovering new things in life.

    The prospects of the Seven-Year Plan encourage the Soviet people to work selflessly.
    Promoting the creative spirit of the masses can accelerate the pace of progress.

    The construction of a communist society has entered such a historical period that Lenin's theory of socialist victory, which has been brilliantly realized and constantly enriched in practice, has been further developed. All this is of great international significance for uniting all progressive people under the banner of peace, friendship, and socialism. (Applause)

    Comrades! In the Soviet Union, the first country to open the road to socialism for mankind, the productive forces have reached such a high level that it is already possible to embark on the magnificent task of building the material and technical foundation of communism.

    The Soviet people unanimously support the control figures for the development of the national economy. They regard the Seven-Year Plan as their own deeply related cause and will spare no effort to complete it. The inspiring prospects of the Seven-Year Plan encourage the Soviet people to create new labor achievements. A socialist competition is being widely carried out in our country. The ranks of innovators, rationalizers, and inventors are growing, and teams of communist labor have emerged.

    Selfless labor for the victory of communism has become a personal need of the broad masses. Young people graduating from secondary schools, secondary technical schools, and vocational training classes are participating in the communist labor teams. They quickly master new technologies and crafts, organize labor in new ways, and raise the socialist competition to a higher stage of development. The task now is for the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations to timely grasp these outstanding shoots of communist labor organizations, summarize the advanced experience of production innovators, and promote this experience to all enterprises.

    We should promote the new labor qualities of the Soviet people, especially the youth, and educate them with patriotism and lofty communist moral principles. Party organizations, economic organizations, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations should resolutely fight to improve labor productivity, to oppose all extravagance and waste of people's wealth, and to strive to unconditionally complete all technical and economic indicators of the production plan, striving to reduce costs and improve product quality. Improving labor productivity is the most important and the main condition for the victory of the new communist society.

    The entire activity of our Party is to promote the initiative and creativity of the masses and to increase their enthusiasm, to support all new and advanced things, in order to improve labor productivity, increase material production, thereby accelerating the pace of our victorious advance.

    The Seven-Year Plan is a decisive stage in the competition between the two systems.
    A major qualitative change will take place in the structure of the Soviet national economy.

    The Seven-Year Plan for the further development of the national economy marks a new and decisive stage in the competition between socialism and capitalism. In this historical period, we will take a giant step forward in the task of catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product output. During the Seven-Year Plan period, major qualitative changes will take place in the structure of our country's national economy. The production of steel and non-ferrous metals will be greatly increased, the chemical industry will be accelerated, the extraction of oil and gas will be increased, the scale of machinery and instrument manufacturing will be expanded, and the electrification of all production departments, transportation, and agriculture will be vigorously developed.

    By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the total output value of agriculture will be nearly doubled, and the production of grain, sugar beets, cotton, potatoes, vegetables, meat, milk, and oils will also increase. Solving this task will first and foremost involve greatly increasing the yield per unit area of all crops, increasing the number of livestock, and further improving the output of public animal husbandry.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people will certainly complete this magnificent Seven-Year Plan, which opens up unlimited prospects for the development of material production.

    We have all the conditions to enable the Soviet people to live better in the near future and to more fully meet their material and spiritual needs. In our country, all material wealth belongs to the people and is for the benefit of the people. During the Seven-Year Plan period, we will greatly increase national income, raise the actual wage levels of workers and the income of collective farmers, improve commercial services and living services for residents, and further expand housing and municipal construction. In capitalist countries, the situation is completely different. In our Soviet Union, the material well-being of the people is constantly improving, the working day is shortening, and the number of the working class is increasing; but in capitalist countries, the main purpose of production is not to meet the material and cultural needs of the residents, but to pursue maximum profits. All the consequences arising from this are: the number of unemployed people is constantly increasing, the prices of daily necessities are rising, and the living standards of the working people are declining. That is why the socialist way of life currently has the greatest appeal to all the working people. The eyes of all progressive people around the world are focused on this way of life.

    We are moving forward and achieving one victory after another because in our country, the Party has cultivated excellent cadres for all departments of the national economy. Workers and collective farmers, scientists and experts are constantly cared for in our country. This enables us to push the socialist economy forward by leaps and bounds.

    The Central Committee of the Party strictly adheres to the principle of collective leadership.
    Past acts of undermining socialist legality have been corrected.

    Comrades! After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Leninist norms in Party life were fully restored in our country, and the principle of collective leadership was restored. Lenin provided an example of strictly adhering to the principle of collective leadership. Even in the most difficult periods of Party and state life, Lenin still believed that it was necessary to hold congresses, conferences, and plenary sessions of the Central Committee on schedule. Our Leninist Central Committee follows this profound Party principle and discusses extremely important pressing issues with the entire people. The nationwide discussion and endorsement of Comrade Ni. Xie. Khrushchev's report outline is a testament to this.

    Regular meetings of staff in industry and agriculture, nationwide discussions of draft Party resolutions, and the active participation of the masses in formulating national economic plans have become forms of attracting the masses to participate in state management. This form can ensure that the Soviet people fully exert their creativity and talent.

    The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union called on the Party to thoroughly correct the acts of undermining revolutionary socialist legality that occurred during the period of personality cult. The border area committees, state committees, the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of various republics, and the Supervisory Committee of the Central Committee of the CPSU, implemented this instruction of the Party Congress and restored the Party membership of those Party members who had been expelled in the past as if they had committed the most serious political crimes. Those who were groundlessly expelled from the Party in the past were basically leading cadres of Party, Soviet, economic, military, and other departments. Comrade Ni. Xie. Khrushchev's conclusion at the Party's 20th Congress has been fully confirmed by some materials that have been rehabilitated and restored to Party membership in accordance with statutory procedures. This conclusion is that the means of persecution adopted against some Party, Soviet, and economic departments were unfounded and were a brutal violation of socialist legality. This violation was caused by the personality cult and its consequences.

    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union thoroughly corrected past acts of undermining socialist legality. Those Communists who were punished on trumped-up charges have returned to the Party, and those who violated Soviet law have been or are being punished by the Party.

    The Party educates cadres in the spirit of faithfulness to communism.
    We must wage the most resolute struggle against bourgeois habits.

    The Communist Party educates cadres in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, faithfulness to communism, and a high degree of conscious discipline, which is permeated with Leninist principles, strict demands, and intolerance of shortcomings.

    It is possible for some incongruous, backward sentiments, views, and ideas inherited from the old capitalist traditions to seep into the Party, and sometimes they do seep in. We should wage the most resolute and merciless struggle against these sentiments, views, and ideas.

    To fight for the Party's general line, for the purity of the Party's ranks, against all forms of opportunism and revisionism, and for communist morality—this is one of the main tasks of every Communist Party member.

    Bureaucracy, indifference to the needs and demands of the working people, corruption and bribery, administrative overreach; all of these are bourgeois habits, and the embodiments of these habits are accomplices and defenders of the remnants of capitalism.

    When handling letters from the working people, the Party organs and the Party's Supervisory Committee exposed and corrected some shortcomings existing in the actual work of our Soviet, economic, social, and other organs. Recently, the Party's Supervisory Committee has received some accusations accusing individual staff members of the National Economic Committee of violating state discipline, accusing individual enterprises of serious shortcomings in their work, some mismanagement and procrastination, and the failure of some enterprises to complete collaborative supply.

    According to the resolution of the May Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU (1958), the Party's Supervisory Committee accepted some appeals. For example, Comrades Lezhov, Kolosov, and Begoulov, members of the CPSU, reported to the Party's Supervisory Committee about the improper behavior of Comrade Veselovsky, Chairman of the Mordovian National Economic Committee. As a result, it was found that Comrade Veselovsky violated the investment use system stipulated in the plan for the development of the national economy. He also withdrew 10.5 million rubles from the construction costs of a very important construction project that had already started—the construction of the Salang Second Thermal Power Plant—and from the construction costs of installing power transmission devices in the cement plant and pharmaceutical plant, and used these funds for the reconstruction of a university that was not planned.

    The Party's Supervisory Committee also discovered the same illegal acts in the Ivanovo National Economic Committee. Comrade Alekseev, Chairman of this National Economic Committee, violated the Party's and the government's instructions on abiding by state discipline and illegally misappropriated investments designated for building workers' residences for textile enterprises.

    The Party requires the leaders of Soviet and economic organs to strictly implement the plan for supplying products to other economic zones, and localism that harms the interests of the whole people must never be allowed to occur. Last year, the Party's Supervisory Committee heard an appeal from Comrade Orzhevsky, Director of the Saratov Technical Glass Factory, and Comrade Chernyaev, Secretary of the Party Committee, regarding the Novosibirsk Heavy Machine Tool and Hydraulic Press Factory's undermining of collaborative supply relations. The review results showed that the Novosibirsk factory did not implement the decision of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. According to this decision, it had to process, assemble, and supply thirty conveyor belt workbenches for grinding large-sized glass for the Saratov Technical Glass Factory, which was under construction, in the third quarter of 1955. The Novosibirsk factory needed five or six months to complete this order. However, the completion of this order was delayed for more than three years, which put the Saratov Technical Glass Factory in a difficult situation. It was not until the Party's Supervisory Committee intervened in this matter that the Novosibirsk factory manufactured and shipped twenty-four of the thirty conveyor belt workbench orders in two months.

    In order to implement the decision of the May Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU, the Party's Supervisory Committee should strengthen the inspection of how Communist Party members abide by Party and state discipline, and should resolutely fight for the rational and economical use of materials and state funds. We should handle letters and applications from the working people in a timely and prompt manner, treat their needs with concern and caution, meet the reasonable demands of the masses, and correct the shortcomings that appear in the work of some Party organizations, economic institutions, Soviet organs, and people's organizations.

    The Soviet Union has consistently strived to ease international tensions.
    Completing the Seven-Year Plan is a powerful support for the forces of peace.

    Comrades! The Communist Party enjoys unlimited prestige among the masses because all its practical activities, as well as the activities of the Soviet government, and all plans for developing the national economy and prospering culture, are aimed at building a new communist society.

    The Soviet Union is a multi-ethnic country based on the friendship of all equal ethnic groups and has consistently implemented Lenin's ethnic policies. In the struggle to complete the plans for economic and cultural construction, the Soviet people are supported by the working people of the People's Republic of China and the people of other socialist camp countries, who are confidently moving forward along the path of socialism, by the Communist Parties, Workers' Parties, and Labor Parties of capitalist countries, and by the sympathy of all progressive people in the world. The extremely great power of the international communist movement, which guides the broad masses of working people in all countries, also lies in this internationalist solidarity.

    The Soviet people warmly support the peaceful diplomatic policy pursued by the Soviet government to defend peace and ease international tensions. Although the aggressive blocs of Western European countries are intensifying the "Cold War" against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the Soviet Union has consistently strived to cooperate with all countries and has persistently fought for a permanent end to the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, for general or partial disarmament, and for the peaceful settlement of all disputes. The Soviet government has repeatedly proposed to Western countries to conclude treaties of non-aggression, disarmament, and troop withdrawal from other countries, and has always supported the proposal of the People's Republic of Poland to establish a nuclear-weapon-free and rocket-weapon-free zone in Europe. However, these proposals, like many other concrete proposals of the Soviet Union, have not been approved by Western countries.

    The Soviet Union has become a world power due to the development of the socialist economy. It possesses all the necessary conditions to build the material foundation of communism, defend the achievements of socialism, and resist the conspiracies of all imperialist aggressors.

    Completing the Seven-Year Plan for the further development of the national economy is our international obligation to the entire progressive humanity, because the new achievements in the construction of a communist society will provide stronger spiritual support for the progressive forces of all countries to consolidate peace and fight for democracy and social progress. (Applause)

    Comrades! Comrade Khrushchev's report, the Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union, will be recorded as an outstanding document in the history of our Party. This document shows the Soviet people the glorious and magnificent prospects for advancing towards communism and explores the important issues of further developing Marxist-Leninist theory and building a communist society.

    With the support of all progressive people, the Soviet people are confidently advancing towards the victory of communism. The Marxist-Leninism enriched by the experience of the international communist movement, the practical work of the Communist Parties, Workers' Parties, and Labor Parties of all countries, and the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which is entering a period of full-scale construction of a communist society, illuminates our path.

    The 21st Congress of the Party more powerfully showed the unbreakable unity of the Soviet people in spirit and politics, and showed the fact that the working people are united around the Party and its Leninist Central Committee, which is guiding our country towards new victories. (Applause) The wisdom of our Party, the invincible power of the people, and their boiling enthusiasm and high creativity guaranteeing the smooth completion of the Seven-Year Plan lie in this unity.

    Long live the builders of communism - the Soviet people!
    Long live the leading and guiding force of Soviet society - the Communist Party of the Soviet Union! (Stormy, prolonged applause)

    苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员
    什维尔尼克在苏共二十一次代表大会上的发言
    新华社5日讯　据“真理报”报道：苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员什维尔尼克2月2日上午在苏共第二十一次代表大会上的发言，全文如下：
    同志们，苏联共产党在召开第二十一次代表大会的时候，已经空前团结一致，它同人民的联系已经非常紧密，它正在满怀信心地向着自己的最终目的——共产主义在我国的完全胜利前进。现在，苏联在经济和文化各方面都获得了具有历史意义的成就。在我国伟大的社会主义改造过程中，工农业蓬勃地发展起来，文化繁荣了，人民的物质福利提高了。
    苏联国民经济在过去的年代中高速度发展
    为建立共产主义物质技术基础积蓄了力量
    国民经济的高涨不仅在数量上、而且在质量上为建立共产主义的物质技术基础积蓄了力量，由于党中央始终一贯地执行党的列宁主义总路线，由于我国人民忘我的劳动，苏维埃国家的威力更加加强了，它的国际威信日益提高。苏联已经是一个具有高度发展的经济、技术和先进的科学文化的强大的社会主义国家。
    在过去的年代中，我国的社会主义工业是以直线上升、以资本主义历史上所没有过的高速度向前发展的。党一方面实现优先发展重工业的列宁主义总路线，一方面在最近五年中在急剧提高农业各部门方面进行了巨大的工作。这就是史无前例的争取粮食的斗争，经过这一斗争，1958年我们采购了三十五亿普特谷物。三千六百五十万公顷荒地的开垦，在这方面起了很大的作用。也正是这件事使谷物的收获量获得了急剧的增加，使畜牧业得到了很大的发展。
    除了工业的发展和农业的高涨外，我们在消费品的生产方面也比1940年几乎增加了两倍。在我国，人民的物质福利和文化水平不断地提高。职工的实际收入几乎增加一倍，农民的实际收入增加了一倍多。目前正在顺利地实现着向缩短的工作日过渡，职工的优抚赡养得到了改善，满足劳动人民住宅的任务也正在大力解决。
    党和政府十分关怀进一步发展社会主义文化、改进中等和高等教育，十分关怀教育和生产实践相结合、培养专业干部和进一步发展科学等问题。在培养干部方面，苏联占世界第一位。苏联的科学家、工程师和工人以卓越的科学技术的新发现为祖国增光。在人类历史上，苏联首先建成了原子能发电站、原子破冰船，发射了人造卫星。成为太阳系人造行星的多级宇宙火箭的发射，是苏联科学技术和苏联人民的天才的凯歌。
    党开辟了建设共产主义社会的新途径
    对马克思列宁主义理论作出了新贡献
    我国人民在建设共产主义的物质技术基础方面的伟大成就，是在共产党及其列宁主义的中央委员会领导下取得的社会主义经济的巨大增长、工业的高度技术水平、科学技术和文化繁荣的合乎规律的结果。（掌声）
    我们党之所以获得了卓越的成就，是因为它遵循着弗·伊·列宁的指示，正确地确定当前最迫切、最紧要的任务，并集中劳动人民和全体人民的力量去解决它。共产党在解决发展国家经济和文化的伟大任务时，开辟了建设共产主义社会的新途径，用经验丰富了马克思列宁主义理论。苏共第二十次代表大会的决议和以后几次中央全会的决议，如关于改组工业和建筑的管理、关于改组机器拖拉机站和进一步发展并巩固集体农庄制度、关于农业发展的结果和进一步增加农产品生产量、关于进一步发展国民教育制度等决议，对经济和文化建设产生了良好的影响，并成为我党对马克思列宁主义理论的新贡献。
    苏联人勇敢地开拓着通向未来的道路。他们在科学技术进步中居领先地位，在巩固苏维埃社会主义制度方面不断取得日新月异的成就。在解决苏联建设共产主义的物质技术基础的伟大任务方面，尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫起着杰出的作用。
    依靠群众的无限支持和他们的创造性积极性，我们党动员苏联人民为争取社会主义经济、文化、劳动人民的物质福利达到新的巨大的高涨而斗争。
    目前已被揭露和在思想上已被粉碎的马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团，曾经阻止党去完成这项任务。这个派别集团企图破坏党在改善生产力的配置、进一步提高农业、调整对工业和建筑业的管理等方面采取的措施。马林科夫反党集团竭力破坏党在一切极重要的问题上的总路线，企图破坏我们党的队伍的团结。
    生活嘲笑了马林科夫反党集团的派别分子们，并且证实我们党为维护苏联人民利益而采取的措施是正确的。我们党遵循着列宁主义原则的政策，善于在历史的一切转变关头找到正确解决问题的方法。党无论过去和现在一向由于它忠于列宁主义、忠于党的队伍的统一和团结而取得胜利。我们党的力量在于它密切联系群众，考虑人民的经验，及时地满足群众的迫切需要，并且善于发现生活中的新事物。
    七年计划的前景鼓舞苏联人民忘我劳动
    发扬群众创造精神就能加快前进的步伐
    共产主义社会的建设，已经进入了这样一个历史时期：已经光辉实现、并在实践中不断丰富的列宁的社会主义胜利的理论，有了进一步的发展。这一切对于把全体进步人们团结在和平、友好和社会主义的旗帜之下，具有重大的国际意义。（掌声）
    同志们！在第一个为人类开辟了走向社会主义道路的苏联，生产力已经达到这样高的水平，已有可能着手实现建立共产主义物质技术基础的宏伟任务。
    苏联人民一致拥护发展国民经济的控制数字，他们认为七年计划是自己切身有关的事业，他们将不遗余力地来完成这个计划。激奋人心的七年计划的前景，鼓舞着苏联人民创造新的劳动业绩。我国正在广泛地开展着社会主义竞赛，革新者、合理化建议者和发明家的队伍日益扩大，并且出现了共产主义劳动队。
    为共产主义的胜利而忘我劳动成了广大人民群众的切身需要。参加共产主义劳动队的有从中等学校、中等技术学校和专业训练班毕业的青年，他们很快地掌握着新的技术和工艺学，按新的方式组织劳动，把社会主义竞赛提高到更高的发展阶段。现在的任务是使党、工会和共青团组织及时抓住共产主义劳动组织的这些卓越的幼芽，总结生产革新者的先进经验，把这些经验推广到所有企业中去。
    我们应该发扬苏维埃人，特别是青年的新的劳动品质，以爱国主义精神和崇高的共产主义道德原则教育他们。党组织、经济组织、工会和共青团组织，应该坚决地为提高劳动生产率、为反对一切铺张浪费和不爱惜人民财富的作法，以及为争取无条件地完成生产计划的全部技术经济指标而斗争，力求减低成本和提高产品质量。提高劳动生产率，是新的共产主义社会取得胜利的最重要的、也是最主要的条件。
    我们党的全部活动都是为了发扬群众的主动创造精神和提高他们的积极性，支持一切新的先进的事物，以提高劳动生产率，增加物质生产，从而加快我们胜利前进的步伐。
    七年计划是两个制度竞赛的决定性阶段
    苏联国民经济结构将要发生重大的质变
    进一步发展国民经济的七年计划，标志着社会主义同资本主义竞赛的新的、决定性的阶段。在这个历史时期，在实际完成按人口平均计算的产品产量方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家的任务中，我们将迈出巨大的一步。七年计划期间，我国的国民经济结构将发生重大的质变。将大大增加钢铁和有色金属的生产，加速发展化学工业，增加石油和瓦斯的开采量，扩大机器和仪器制造业的规模，大力发展一切生产部门、运输业和农业的电气化。
    七年计划结束时，农业总产值将增加近一倍，谷物、甜菜、棉花、马铃薯、蔬菜、肉类、牛奶、油脂的生产也将增加。解决这项任务将首先通过大大提高一切农作物的单位面积产量，增加牲畜的头数和进一步提高公有畜牧业的产量。
    苏联人民在共产党的领导下，一定会完成这一为发展物质生产开辟了无限前途的宏伟的七年计划。
    我们具备一切条件在最近期间让苏联人民生活得更好，更加充分地满足他们在物质和精神上的要求。在我国，一切物质财富都属于人民，并为人民谋福利。七年计划期间，我们将大大增加国民收入，提高工人的实际工资水平和集体农民的收入，改善对居民的商业服务和生活服务，更加扩大住宅和市政建设。在资本主义国家，情况却完全两样。在我们的苏联，人民的物质福利不断提高，工作日在缩短，工人阶级的人数在增加；但是在资本主义国家，生产的主要目的不是为了满足居民的物质和文化需要，而是为了追逐最大限度的利润。由此而产生的一切后果是：失业人数不断增加，日用品价格上涨，劳动人民生活水平降低。这就是为什么目前社会主义的生活方式对所有的劳动人民都具有最大的吸引力。全世界一切进步人们的目光都注视着这种生活方式。
    我们之所以前进并且获得一个又一个的胜利，是因为在我们国家里，党为国民经济各部门培养了优秀的干部。工人和集体农民、科学家和专家在我国是时刻受到关怀的。这就使得我们能够推动社会主义经济一日千里的前进。
    党中央委员会严格遵循集体领导的原则
    过去破坏社会主义法制的行为已被纠正
    同志们！苏共第二十次代表大会以后，在我国完全恢复了党生活中的列宁主义准则，恢复了集体领导的原则。列宁提供了严格遵守集体领导原则的范例。甚至在党和国家生活中最困难的时期，列宁仍认为必须按期举行代表大会，代表会议和中央全会。我们列宁主义的中央委员会遵循着这项深刻的党的原则，同全体人民一道讨论极重大的迫切问题。全民讨论和拥护尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的报告提纲，就是明证。
    定期举行工农业各部门工作人员的会议，对党的决议草案进行全民讨论，群众积极参加制定国民经济计划，这已经成为吸引群众参加国家管理的形式，这种形式可以保证苏联人民充分发挥创造力和才干。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会曾号召党彻底纠正在个人迷信时期所发生的破坏革命的社会主义法制行为。边疆区委员会、州委员会、各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会和苏共中央监察委员会，执行了党代表大会的这一指示，恢复了过去那些好像是因犯了最重大的政治罪行而被开除的党员的党籍。过去被无端开除出党的基本上是一些党的、苏维埃的、经济的、军事的和其他部门的领导干部。尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在党的第二十次代表大会上的结论已由根据法定程序恢复名誉和恢复党籍的一些材料所完全证实，这个结论就是对某些党、苏维埃和经济部门的工作人员所采取的迫害手段是没有任何根据的，而且是对社会主义法制的粗暴破坏，这种破坏是由于个人迷信及其后果而引起的。
    苏联共产党彻底纠正了过去破坏社会主义法制的行为。那些根据莫须有的罪名而受到处分的共产党员已回到了党内，苏维埃法律的破坏者已经受到或正在受到党的处分。
    党以忠实于共产主义的精神来教育干部
    必须同资产阶级习气进行最坚决的斗争
    共产党以批评和自我批评、忠实于共产主义的精神、以高度自觉的纪律精神来教育干部，这种自觉的纪律贯串着列宁主义原则性、严格要求和对缺点的不调和性。
    在党内可能渗入，有时也的确渗入一种格格不入的、从过去资本主义旧传统中继承下来的落后的情调、观点和思想。我们应当同这些情调、观点和思想进行最坚决和无情的斗争。
    为党的总路线、为党的队伍的纯洁性、反对形形色色的机会主义和修正主义、为共产主义道德而斗争——这是每一个共产党员的主要任务之一。
    官僚主义、对劳动人民需要和要求漠不关心、贪污受贿、行政上的越权；所有这一些都是资产阶级习气，这些习气的体现者是资本主义残余的同谋者和维护者。
    党的机关和党的监察委员会在处理劳动人民的来信时，揭露了我们苏维埃、经济、社会和其他机关的实际工作中存在的一些缺点，并进行了纠正。最近，党的监察委员会已收到一些控诉书，控告国民经济委员会的个别工作人员违反国家纪律，控告个别企业工作中有严重缺点，一些不善于管理和拖沓作风以及某些企业没有完成协作供应的情况。
    根据苏共中央五月全会（1958年）的决议，党监察委员会受理了某些申诉。例如，苏共党员雷若夫、科洛索夫和别戈乌洛夫同志向党的监察委员会报告了莫尔多瓦国民经济委员会主席维谢洛夫斯基同志不正确的行为。结果查明，维谢洛夫斯基同志破坏了发展国民经济计划所规定的投资使用制度。他从业已动工的一项极重要的建筑工程——萨朗第二热电站的建筑费中，还从在水泥厂和药剂厂内兴修输电装置的建筑费中，抽出了一千零五十万卢布，并把这些资金用在未经计划规定的一所大学的改建上。
    党监察委员会在伊凡诺佛国民经济委员会也发现了同样的违法行为。这个国民经济委员会的主席阿列克谢也夫同志违背党和政府关于遵守国家纪律的指示，非法地把规定用来修建纺织企业工人住宅的投资擅自挪作他用。
    党要求苏维埃和经济机关的领导人严格执行向其他经济区供应产品的计划，决不允许发生危害全民利益的地方主义。去年，党监察委员会审理了萨拉托夫技术玻璃厂厂长奥尔热夫斯基同志和党委会书记契尔尼亚耶夫同志关于新西伯利亚重型机床和水压机工厂破坏协作供应关系的申诉。审查结果表明，新西伯利亚厂确实没有执行苏联部长会议的决定，根据这项决定，它必须在1955年第三季度为正在兴建中的萨拉托夫技术玻璃厂加工、装配和供应三十台供研磨大尺寸玻璃用的输送带工作台。新西伯利亚工厂需用五、六个月的时间来完成这项定货。但是，这项定货的完成却拖延了三年多之久，结果，使萨拉托夫技术玻璃厂陷入困难的境地。直到党监察委员会干预了这件事以后，新西伯利亚工厂才在两个月的时间内制成并运出了三十部输送带工作台定货中的二十四部。
    为了执行苏共中央五月全会的决定，党监察委员会应该加强检查共产党员遵守党和国家纪律的情况，应该坚决为合理地、节约地使用物资和国家资金而斗争。我们应该及时地、迅速地处理劳动人民的来信和申请书，关切而慎重地对待他们的需要，满足群众合理的要求，纠正某些党组织、经济机构、苏维埃机关和人民团体工作中所出现的缺点。
    苏联始终不渝地争取缓和国际紧张局势
    完成七年计划是对和平力量的有力支持
    同志们！共产党所以在群众中享有无限的威信，是因为它的全部实际活动以及苏联政府的活动、发展国家经济和繁荣文化的一切计划，都是为了建设新的共产主义社会。
    苏联是一个以各平等的民族友好为基础的多民族国家，并始终不渝地执行列宁的民族政策。在为完成经济和文化建设计划的斗争中，苏联人民得到满怀信心地沿着社会主义道路前进的中华人民共和国劳动人民和社会主义阵营其他国家的人民的支持，得到资本主义国家共产党、工人党和劳动党的支持，得到世界一切进步人们的同情。引导世界各国广大劳动群众前进的国际共产主义运动的极伟大的力量，也就在于这种国际主义的团结。
    苏联人民热烈拥护苏联政府为保卫和平和缓和国际紧张局势而奉行的和平外交政策。尽管西欧国家的侵略集团以加紧“冷战”来反对苏联和其他社会主义国家，苏联始终不渝地竭力争取同所有的国家合作，坚持不懈地为永久停止试验原子武器和氢武器，为普遍或部分地裁减军备及和平解决一切争端而斗争。苏联政府不只一次地建议西方国家缔结互不侵犯、裁军以及从他国境内撤军的条约，并且过去和现在一直都赞成波兰人民共和国关于在欧洲建立无核武器和火箭武器区的建议。但是，这些建议也和苏联其他许多具体建议一样，没有得到西方国家的赞同。
    苏联由于社会主义经济的发展已成为世界的强国。它拥有一切必要条件来建立共产主义物质基础，捍卫社会主义的成果，反对所有帝国主义侵略者的阴谋。
    完成进一步发展国民经济的七年计划，是我们对整个进步人类的国际义务，因为共产主义社会建设的新成就，将给予为巩固和平、争取民主和社会进步的各国进步力量以更强有力的精神上的支持。（掌声）
    同志们！赫鲁晓夫同志的关于苏联发展国民经济七年计划的报告，将作为一个卓越的文件载入我们党的史册。这个文件向苏联人民展示了向共产主义前进的光辉壮阔的远景，探讨了进一步发展马克思列宁主义理论和建设共产主义社会的重要问题。
    苏联人民在所有进步人们的支持下，信心百倍地朝着共产主义的胜利前进。为国际共产主义运动的实践，为各国共产党、工人党和劳动党的工作实践，以及进入全面展开共产主义社会建设的时期的苏联共产党的经验所丰富了的马克思列宁主义，照耀着我们的道路。
    党的第二十一次代表大会更加有力地显示出苏联人民在精神上和政治上的牢不可破的团结一致，显示出劳动人民团结在引导我国走向新的胜利的党及其列宁主义的中央委员会周围的事实。（掌声）我们党的英明，人民的不可战胜的力量，以及他们的沸腾的热情和保证七年计划顺利完成的高度创造性就在于这种团结。
    共产主义的建设者——苏联人民万岁！
    苏维埃社会的领导和指导力量——苏联共产党万岁！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）　（文内插题是本报编者加的）
