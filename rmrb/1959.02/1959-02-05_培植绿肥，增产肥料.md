    Cultivating Green Manure, Increasing Fertilizer Production
    Sun Yuan
    Recently, newspapers have published many reports about cultivating green manure crops. The news says that many areas in the South are taking increasing green manure production as an important measure to solve the fertilizer problem. This approach is entirely correct.
  The management of green manure has a major characteristic: people can cultivate it in a planned way by rationally utilizing the land, rather than passively waiting for nature's bounty. This provides a reliable way to solve the fertilizer source problem in the future. We know that the fertilizer source problem has always been the first hurdle to overcome in carrying out a manure accumulation campaign. Where to get so much fertilizer? Is the fertilizer source guaranteed? Some people worry: After last year's unprecedented manure accumulation campaign, the fertilizer sources have been searched all over and dug up almost completely. It's probably impossible to get more fertilizer! This idea is negative and incorrect, but the question it raises prompts people to consider how to open up and expand fertilizer sources under the new circumstances.
    Why does the problem of fewer and fewer fertilizer sources arise? The reason is that some people are always accustomed to circling around several readily available natural farm fertilizers. They only see that some existing fertilizer sources have temporarily shrunk, but they have not seen that with the development of production and the increase of knowledge, many new usable fertilizer sources have emerged. In today's high-speed agricultural development, it is not enough to rely solely on the original fertilizer sources. On the one hand, we must fully utilize the "spontaneously" generated fertilizer sources of nature, and on the other hand, we also need to cultivate and open up richer artificial fertilizer sources in a planned way. River mud, pond mud, kang soil, and wall soil are constantly generated in the long run, but they are limited in a certain period. After digging once, you have to wait a period of time before you can dig again. However, the fertilizer sources cultivated and opened up by people's subjective efforts in a planned way are infinite. Taking planting green manure as an example, expanding the planting of green manure by using idle fields and wasteland, coupled with appropriate improvements in cultivation techniques, can obtain a large amount of fertilizer. Planting green manure is like this, and so is making chemical fertilizers. People can completely plant and produce large amounts of fertilizer without waiting for nature's bounty, and therefore are not restricted by natural fertilizer sources.
    We must look at the fertilizer source problem from a developmental perspective. The more developed the production, the better the conditions for artificial control and cultivation of fertilizer sources. The development of the chemical industry will bring about an increase in chemical fertilizer production. The comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries will greatly expand fertilizer sources. With the progress of planting less and harvesting more, more and more idle fields can be freed up for planting green manure. This is how people adapt to nature and control nature step by step. In agricultural production, at first, people could only seize fertilizer from nature to supply the land, but now they can cultivate and manufacture more and better green manure and chemical fertilizers with their own hands. This is the main basis for the inexhaustible fertilizer sources, and it is also an example of people constantly controlling and utilizing nature in accordance with objective laws.

    培植绿肥，增产肥料
    孙渊
    最近，报纸上发表了很多关于培育绿肥作物的报道。消息中说，南方不少地区正在把增产绿肥作为解决肥料问题的一个重要的措施。这种作法，是完全正确的。
  经营绿肥，有一个很大的特点，就是人们通过合理利用土地，可以有计划地培养，而不是消极地等待自然界赐予。这给今后解决肥源问题，提供了一条可靠的途径。我们知道，肥源问题历来是开展积肥运动必须打通的第一关。从哪里获得这么多的肥料？肥源有没有保证？有些人担心：经过去年规模空前的积肥运动，肥源已经找遍了，也挖得差不多了，再想取得更多的肥料，恐怕办不到了！这种想法是消极的，不对头的，但是它提出的问题，却也促使人们必须考虑解决在新的情况下如何开辟和扩大肥源的问题。
    为什么会产生肥源越挖越少的问题？原因是有些人总是习惯于在几种现成的、比较容易弄到手的农家自然肥料上面打圈子，他们只看到某些现成的肥源暂时缩小了，却没有看到随着生产的发展和知识的增加，又产生了许多可以利用的新肥源。农业高速度发展的今天，仅仅依靠原有的那些肥源已经很不够了，必须一方面充分利用自然界“自发”产生的肥源，另方面也需要有计划地培养和开辟更丰富的人工肥源。河泥、塘泥、炕土、墙土，这些肥源从长远说是不断产生的，但是在一定时间内却又是有限的，挖了一次，必须等待一个
  时期，才能再挖。但是，由人们靠自己的主观努力有计划地培养和开辟的肥源却是无限的。拿种绿肥来说，利用休闲田和荒地扩大种植绿肥，加上适当改进栽培技术就可以取得大量的肥料。种绿肥如此，造化学肥料也是如此。人们完全可以种出和造出大量的肥料，不必等待自然界的赐予，因而也就不受自然肥源的限制。
    必须用发展的观点来看肥源问题。生产越是发展，人工控制和培养肥源的条件也越好。化学工业的发展，会带来化肥的增产。农林牧副渔的全面发展，会使肥源大大扩大。随着少种多收的进展，又可以腾出越来越多的休闲田种绿肥。人就是这样适应自然，又一步一步地支配自然的。在农业生产中，开始人只能向自然界夺取肥料供给土地，现在却能够用自己的双手栽培和制造出更多更好的绿肥和化肥了。这是肥源挖不尽的主要根据，同时也是人们按照客观规律不断地控制和利用自然的一个例证。
