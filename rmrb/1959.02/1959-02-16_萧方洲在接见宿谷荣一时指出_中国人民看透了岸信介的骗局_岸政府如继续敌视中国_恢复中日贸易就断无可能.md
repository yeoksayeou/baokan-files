Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: Xiao Fangzhou, Deputy Secretary-General of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, met with Shukutani Eiichi, Vice President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and Chairman of the Board of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition, this morning.

During the meeting, the two sides discussed issues related to Sino-Japanese trade. Xiao Fangzhou welcomed Shukutani Eiichi and the many related groups and individuals in Japan for their consistent efforts to enhance Sino-Japanese friendship and promote Sino-Japanese trade. Xiao Fangzhou said, "Regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese trade, we originally did not want to say anything, because our attitude on this issue has long been very clear. However, since Mr. Shukutani mentioned this aspect, we might as well talk about it again.

　　"Developing Sino-Japanese trade on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual friendship was originally a good thing, in line with the wishes and interests of the people of both countries, and it can be said to have great prospects. However, the Kishi Nobusuke government has adopted a policy of hostility towards China, thoroughly destroying this trade relationship. The Kishi Nobusuke government has consistently antagonized China, engaged in various obstructions and sabotage of the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, and finally brazenly tore up this agreement, even repeatedly condoning thugs to insult our national flag. Under these circumstances, the Chinese people could no longer tolerate it and had to decisively stop trade with Japan. Therefore, all responsibility and consequences must be borne by the Kishi Nobusuke government. This issue is very clear.

　　"Perhaps Kishi Nobusuke still thinks that China cannot do without trade with Japan? The evidence is that he has recently deliberately spread the rumor that China simply cannot do without trade with Japan. This is completely fabricated. Let us answer with facts. China's industrial and agricultural production in 1958 saw an unprecedented Great Leap Forward, with steel, grain, and cotton all doubling. And this was achieved under the circumstances that Kishi Nobusuke antagonized China, leading to the complete interruption of Sino-Japanese trade relations. This clearly proves that Kishi Nobusuke's rumor is completely unfounded. Today we are still in the Great Leap Forward, and we are preparing for an even greater leap forward. Under the circumstances that Kishi Nobusuke continues to antagonize China, we would rather have no trade relations between China and Japan, but we believe that we will definitely leap forward even better. However, the Kishi Nobusuke government, due to its destruction of Sino-Japanese trade, has caused many difficulties for the Japanese economy, especially for certain Japanese small and medium-sized enterprises. This is a well-known fact. We express our full sympathy for the difficult situation faced by some Japanese small and medium-sized enterprises due to the trade interruption. However, this is precisely the consequence of the Kishi Nobusuke government's antagonism towards China, and therefore this responsibility must be fully borne by the Kishi Nobusuke government. Although we sympathize with the difficult situation of Japanese small and medium-sized enterprises, whether Sino-Japanese trade can be restored depends entirely on whether the Kishi Nobusuke government changes its attitude of hostility towards China.

　　"All facts prove that the Kishi Nobusuke government has not changed its hostile attitude towards China to this day. It is well known that last October, Kishi Nobusuke made an extremely blatant anti-China statement to Brown, a reporter from the American Broadcasting Company. He openly insulted China as "an aggressor invading Jinmen and Mazu," clamoring that "for the security of Japan, it is absolutely necessary that South Korea and Taiwan do not fall into the hands of the communists." Even a few days ago, Kishi Nobusuke was still talking about "due to international credibility, it is necessary to always respect the Taiwan government; this is Japan's diplomatic line" in the Japanese Diet, and he emphasized that: "Regarding the issue of Communist China, I think there is no need to change the government's past attitude." On this basis, Kishi Nobusuke actually started singing the tune of "restoring Japan-China trade," but to anyone with clear eyes, these words are deceitful. Because its content is still the cliché of separating politics and economics. How can it be imagined that the Chinese people can allow Kishi Nobusuke to continue his anti-China policy and conduct trade with the side controlled by the Kishi Nobusuke government, which is hostile to China? Obviously, Kishi Nobusuke's pretense is nothing more than because his anti-China policy violates the wishes and interests of the Japanese people and is increasingly opposed by the broad masses of the Japanese people, with even people within his own party rising up to attack him. Therefore, he attempts to use the trade issue, which is of universal concern and expectation to the Japanese people, to once again play a double-dealing trick to deceive and mislead the Japanese people and resolve his own political crisis. The Chinese people have long seen through Kishi Nobusuke's set of denial, obfuscation, and distortion of black and white. The Chinese people have long pointed out that if the Kishi Nobusuke government continues to antagonize China, continues to create the "two Chinas" conspiracy, and continues to obstruct the normalization of relations between the two countries, there will be absolutely no possibility of restoring Sino-Japanese trade. As long as the Kishi Nobusuke government's attitude does not change for a day, we will not trade with Japan for a day; if it does not change for a year, we will not do it for a year; if it does not change for ten years, we will not do it for ten years; if it does not change for a hundred years, we will not do it for a hundred years. This is the firm and solemn position of the 600 million Chinese people—including Chinese overseas compatriots.

　　"The Chinese people feel extremely indignant at the Kishi Nobusuke government's attitude of hostility towards our country, but towards the Japanese people, we have always been friendly, past, present, and future. We firmly believe that the Kishi Nobusuke government's approach is doomed to failure, and the friendship and trade relations between the Chinese and Japanese peoples will eventually be restored and developed. The efforts of broad-minded people in Japan will not be in vain, and that day will surely come."

Shukutani Eiichi said in the conversation that he fully agreed with Xiao Fangzhou's opinion. He also said that the current deadlock in Japan-China trade is entirely the responsibility of Kishi Nobusuke. If Kishi Nobusuke's anti-China policy does not change, then even a partial restoration of Japan-China trade will be impossible.

Finally, Shukutani Eiichi said that after returning to his country, he would continue to work to oppose Kishi Nobusuke's anti-China policy.

    萧方洲在接见宿谷荣一时指出
    中国人民看透了岸信介的骗局
    岸政府如继续敌视中国　恢复中日贸易就断无可能
    新华社15日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会副秘书长萧方洲在今天上午接见了日本国际贸易促进协会副会长、日本商品展览会理事长宿谷荣一。
    接见的时候，双方曾谈到了有关中日贸易的问题。萧方洲对宿谷荣一和日本方面许多有关团体和人士一贯为增进中日友好和促进中日贸易所做的努力，表示欢迎。萧方洲说：“关于中日贸易问题，我们本来不想讲什么话，因为我们对这个问题的态度早已很明确。不过，既然宿谷先生提到这一方面的问题，我们也顺便再谈一谈。
      “在平等互利和相互友好的基础上发展中日贸易，本来是一件好事，符合两国人民的愿望和利益，也可以说是大有前途的。但是，岸信介政府却采取敌视中国的政策，彻底地破坏了这种贸易关系。岸信介政府一贯敌视中国，对签订中日第四次贸易协定进行种种阻挠和破坏，直到最后悍然撕毁了这个协定，甚至一再纵容暴徒侮辱我国国旗，在这种情况下，中国人民忍无可忍，不能不断然停止对日本的贸易。因此，一切责任和后果必须由岸信介政府来承担。这个问题是很清楚的。
      “岸信介也许还觉得中国非同日本进行贸易不可吧？这证据就是他最近故意散布空气，仿佛中国就非同日本进行贸易不可了。这完全是造谣。我们让事实来回答。中国1958年的工农业生产出现了空前的大跃进，钢铁、粮食、棉花都增加了一倍。而这都是在岸信介敌视中国因而中日贸易关系全部中断的情况下获得的。这就清楚地证明岸信介的造谣是完全没有根据的。今天我们依然大跃进，而且准备更大的跃进。在岸信介继续敌视中国的情况下，我们宁愿没有中日间的贸易关系，但我们相信我们一定会跃进得更好。然而岸信介政府由于破坏了中日贸易，却给日本经济，特别是某些日本中小企业，造成了许多困难，这却是人所共知的事实。对于日本一些中小企业由于贸易中断而遭到的困难处境，我们寄予充分的同情。但是，这正是岸信介政府敌视中国所一手造成的后果，因而这责任必须由岸信介政府完全承担。我们对日本中小企业的困难处境虽有同情之心，但是中日贸易能否恢复，问题全在岸信介政府是否改变敌视中国的态度。
      “所有事实都证明：岸信介政府直到今天，丝毫也没有改变它对中国的敌视态度。人所共知，去年10月，岸信介对美国广播公司记者布朗发表了一篇极其露骨敌视我国的谈话，他公然污辱中国“是侵犯金门和马祖的侵略者”，大叫大嚷“对日本的安全来说，南朝鲜和台湾不落入共产党人手中是绝对必要的”。直到前几天，岸信介还在日本国会上大谈什么“由于国际信义的关系，要始终尊重台湾政府，这是日本的外交路线”，并且强调说：
  “关于共产党中国问题，我想没有必要改变政府的既往态度。”岸信介在这种基础上居然唱起“恢复日中贸易”的调子来，但明眼人一看，这些话是骗人的。因为它的内容依然是政治和经济分开的滥调。怎能设想，中国人民可以放任岸信介继续它的敌视中国政策，而和敌视中国的岸信介政府所控制的方面进行贸易呢？很显然，岸信介装作这些姿态，无非是因为他的敌视中国政策，违背日本人民的意愿和利益，越来越遭到广大日本人民的反对，连自己党内的人也群起而攻之，于是他就企图假借日本人民所普遍关心和期待的贸易问题，再一次耍弄两面三刀的手法，来蒙蔽和欺骗日本人民，解救自己的政治危机。中国人民早已看透了岸信介这一套抵赖、蒙混、颠倒黑白的骗局。中国人民早就指出：岸信介政府如果继续敌视中国，继续制造“两个中国”的阴谋，继续阻挠两国关系正常化，恢复中日贸易就断无可能。岸信介政府这种态度一天不变，我们就一天不能同日本做贸易，一年不变就一年不做，十年不变就十年不做，百年不变就百年不做。这是六亿中国人民——包括中国海外侨胞的坚决严正的立场。
      “中国人民对岸信介政府敌视我国的态度，感到无比愤慨，但是对于日本人民，则一直是友好的，过去如此，现在如此，将来也如此。我们深信：岸信介政府这种做法是注定要失败的，中日两国人民的友好和贸易关系终究要获得恢复和发展，日本广大人士的努力是不会落空的，这个日子必将到来。”
    宿谷荣一在谈话中表示完全同意萧方洲的意见。他还说，目前日中贸易的僵局，完全应由岸信介负责。如果岸信介敌视中国的政策不变，那么日中贸易即使是局部的恢复也是不可能的。
    最后，宿谷荣一表示回国以后，他将继续为反对岸信介敌视中国的政策而努力。
