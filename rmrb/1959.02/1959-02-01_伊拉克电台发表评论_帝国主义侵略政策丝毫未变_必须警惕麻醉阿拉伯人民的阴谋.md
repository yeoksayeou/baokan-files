Iraqi Radio Publishes Commentary
Imperialist Aggression Policy Remains Unchanged
Vigilance Must Be Maintained Against Conspiracies to Anesthetize the Arab People
(Reported by this newspaper) Baghdad - The Iraqi Republic Radio broadcast a commentary on the evening of the 29th, pointing out that imperialism has not changed its policies and calling for vigilance against new imperialist conspiracies in the Middle East. The full text of the commentary is as follows:
    Today we live in an era of surging national liberation movements and their significant positive role. The activities of all national forces in colonies and dependent countries have expanded, and the liberation movements are becoming stronger and more clearly aware of their goals. Among these liberation movements, liberating Arab nationalism occupies its rightful place in the decisive battle to eliminate the imperialist system. The disintegration of the imperialist system has become a reality we are witnessing today. Life fully proves that nothing can stop the people of all countries from advancing towards national independence today. All shameful means have failed. Imperialism’s direct rule has failed, direct foreign occupation has failed, the establishment of military bases has failed, and naked interference policies have failed. Therefore, imperialism seeks new ways to weaken the national liberation movement and divert it from the path of struggle.
    If imperialism in the past, for example, hindered any colonial country from establishing national industries, then today it has to change this tactic and replace it with another. That is, through its banks, companies, and hidden agents, it pretends to help a country establish national industries; that is, it pushes some newly independent countries towards simple industrial projects that are weak and unable to compete with its huge plans. If imperialism in the past hindered free parliamentary elections, then today it has to adopt a policy of supporting elections. But in reality, these so-called elections are limited to a portion of the people. It hopes to use this method to establish weak governments that cannot resist it. Due to the rise of the liberated peoples, and due to the powerful and broad wave of unity of all Arab peoples and all Asian and African peoples, imperialism has been forced to abandon the implementation of its shameful plans. Therefore, it is entirely unreasonable to think that the imperialists, especially the US imperialist bloc, have abandoned their evil goals, and that the imperialist danger has lessened or weakened. Imperialism has not changed its policies; it is still pursuing policies of exerting pressure, intimidation, and blockade. Imperialism's goal remains to strangle Arab nationalism, control all Arab countries, and drag them onto its shattered chariot, so that after subduing this Arab country or that Arab country, and eliminating the independent national policies and democratic life of this country or that country, it will use force to subdue the second and third Arab countries. Undoubtedly, it will then be the turn of the newly independent countries in Asia and Africa, the turn to strangle the national revolution in Algeria and the liberation movements in other regions of Asia and Africa.
    These are the dreams and goals of the imperialists, and they have not changed at all. They will not hesitate to take any means to realize these dreams and goals. Therefore, we should be vigilant against every kind of propaganda that repeats the tune of the imperialist bloc striving to change its aggressive imperialist policies. The purpose of this tune is to whitewash imperialism, give it a new guise, and prepare it to appear before the Arab people as a loyal friend rather than a mortal enemy. The purpose of this argument is also to spread seeds of disbelief in the deeply rooted aggressiveness of imperialism in the hearts of the people, in order to clear the way for another idea. This idea is that imperialism may turn over a new leaf, that imperialism may walk with the people of all countries without opposing them. In this way, the people's awareness will be anesthetized, their resistance will be weakened, and their sacred hatred will be diminished, making it possible for imperialism to penetrate and infiltrate, thereby creating convenient conditions for imperialism to strike at liberated Arab nationalism and exert its control and extend its power.
    Imperialism is known for pursuing a "divide and rule" policy. But sometimes we also see it adopting another policy. People who closely watch political events are sometimes deceived by this policy. Some well-informed Arab figures have revealed a document against the Arab nationalism that is shedding blood in Oman and various parts of South Arabia. The content of this document is to prepare a draft treaty to control South Arabia. This treaty stipulates the establishment of a federation in various "protectorates" and emirates, including the Beihan Emirate, the Awazil Sultanate, the Fadli Sultanate, the Dali Emirate, the Upper Awaliq Emirate, and the Lower Yafa Sultanate; however, it must be guaranteed that Britain has complete political, military, and economic control over this so-called federation and that British troops are allowed to be stationed throughout the "federation." Imperialism is hoping that this trick will deceive the Arab peoples and push them onto a dangerous imperialist path disguised as a federation. Imperialism once fantasized that this trick would pass in front of the Arab peoples, because the federation is a very attractive advertisement. However, the Arab people in the south rejected this imperialist treaty, determined to oppose it, determined to eliminate the idea of a federation, and determined to oppose imperialism to the end. The representative of the King of Yemen affirmed that Yemen condemns the British imperialist plan aimed at establishing a federation including various "protectorates" in the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula. He said that Yemen believes that this plan blatantly violates Britain's promises in the 1934 treaty and the 1951 agreement, and believes that this treaty threatens the security of the Kingdom of Yemen.
    This plan came in a campaign of deception and slander, this plan came in a campaign of deception and slander attempting to change imperialism's face, this plan came in a series of imperialist statements attempting to put rouge and powder on imperialism's dirty face, this plan came in visits and talks planned by the imperialist bloc. This plan came after the battles in various parts of the Arab motherland intensified, after the rise of Arab nationalism, and after the magnificent emergence of the Republic of Iraq, which raised the banner of Arabism and nationalism. The imperialists' ship has been battered and broken. The July 14 Revolution, which eliminated the imperialist monarchy, knocked them senseless. It must be affirmed that this plan is accompanied by the massacre, persecution, arrest, and even collective slaughter of patriotic activists in this region of the Arab world, and accompanied by fabricated elections. The purpose of fabricating this election is to implement this plan through some "parliaments" that net imperialist members.
    News reports that British troops have launched the largest-scale attack, using all sea, land, and air weapons, against the strongholds of Omani national fighters, and against peaceful villages near Green Mountain. British artillery used a large number of incendiary bombs and destructive shells to bombard defenseless peaceful residents. Huge explosions could be heard in distant villages. There is nothing new in imperialist policies; terror, slander, and lies are always the first steps in every plan. Let us recall how they once attempted to implement the Greater Syria plan by persecuting the free people of Syria, Jordan, and Iraq with terror policies. Let us recall how the imperialists used prisons and arrests, and fired guns in the streets of Iraq and Jordan, to implement the Jordan-Iraq Federation plan.
    The era when the fate of nations was decided in the capitals of some Western countries is long gone. Agents, traitors, and conspirators can no longer carry out plans with gold-lettered signboards. The original purpose of implementing this plan was to plunder the most precious things of the independent Arab peoples, namely their independence and freedom; the original purpose was to weaken the resistance of the Arab peoples struggling for independence and freedom. News has come that Prince Salah bin Harith Al-Khrousi, the representative of the Imamate of Oman, delivered a speech in India, announcing that the Omani people are fighting for the establishment of a progressive democratic society; while the British imperialists are attempting to impose a feudal, reactionary dictatorship on Oman. The Republic of Iraq has supported the cause of the Omani people, and it will continue to support these causes, because this is its own cause. The Republic of Iraq, which represents the will of all strata and nationalities of Iraq, will continue to support every liberation movement. Because it believes in the right of self-determination for all peoples; because it refuses to compromise and bargain with imperialism; because every struggle of the Arab people is a struggle for liberated Arab nationalism. The Arab peoples will continue to be vigilant and conscious. No conspiracy can escape its eyes, and no plan with attractive and beautiful names can deceive it. Democracy, national independence, and recognition of the people's right to self-determination are the paths to legitimate goals. Dictatorship, terror, enslavement, and denial of the people's right to self-determination are our enemies, the enemies of all Arabs. Because these things can only benefit imperialism and Zionism.

### 伊拉克电台发表评论  帝国主义侵略政策丝毫未变  必须警惕麻醉阿拉伯人民的阴谋

    伊拉克电台发表评论
    帝国主义侵略政策丝毫未变
    必须警惕麻醉阿拉伯人民的阴谋
    本报讯　伊拉克共和国电台29日晚间发表一篇评论，指出帝国主义并没有改变它的政策，要求警惕帝国主义对中东的新阴谋。评论全文如下：
    今天我们生活在民族解放运动高涨和它发挥重大的积极作用的时代。殖民地和附属国的一切民族力量的活动已经伸展起来，解放运动越来越强，越来越清楚地认识到自己的目标。在这些解放运动中间，解放的阿拉伯民族主义在消除帝国主义制度的决定性战斗中占有着它应有的地位。帝国主义制度的解体已经成为我们今天亲眼看见的事实。生活充分地证明了今天没有任何东西能够阻挡各国人民向民族独立迈进。一切丢脸的手段已经失败了。帝国主义直接统治失败了，外国直接占领失败了，建立军事基地失败了，赤裸裸地干涉政策失败了。因此，帝国主义就去寻找新的途径来削弱民族解放运动，使它离开斗争道路。
    如果说帝国主义在过去，比方说，曾经阻挠任何殖民地国家建立民族工业，那么在今天，它就不得不改变这种手段，不得不以另一种手段来代替这种手段。那就是通过它的银行、公司和隐藏的代理人，假装帮助一个国家建立民族工业的手段；那就是把某些新独立的国家推向一些简单的无力和它的巨大计划竞争的工业计划的手段。如果帝国主义过去曾经阻挠举行自由的议会选举，那么在今天，它就不得不采取支持选举的政策。但是实际上这种所谓选举仅仅局限于人民中间的一部分人。它指望通过这种手段建立一些软弱无力、不能抗拒它的政府。由于解放了的各人民的兴起，由于全体阿拉伯人民和所有亚非人民强大而广泛的团结的浪潮，帝国主义被迫放弃执行它的那些丢脸的计划。因此，认为帝国主义者，首先是美帝国主义集团已经放弃了他们的罪恶目标，认为帝国主义危险已经减轻或减弱了，都是全然不合理的。帝国主义并没有改变它的政策，它仍然在执行着施加压力、恫吓和封锁政策。帝国主义的目标仍然是扼杀阿拉伯民族主义，控制所有阿拉伯国家，把它们拖到它的支离破碎的车子上，以便它在屈服了这个阿拉伯国家或那个阿拉伯国家，消除了这个国家或那个国家的独立的民族政策和民主生活以后，再使用力量屈服第二个和第三个阿拉伯国家。毫无疑问，其后就轮到亚非新独立的国家，就轮到扼杀阿尔及利亚的民族革命和亚非两洲其他地区的解放运动。
    这就是帝国主义者的梦想和目标，一点也没有改变。他们不惜采取任何手段来实现他们这些梦想和目标。因此，就应该警惕每一种这样的宣传：它重复着帝国主义集团在努力改变着他们的侵略性的帝国主义政策的调子。这种调子的目的在于给帝国主义洗刷罪恶，使它披上新的外衣，准备让它以忠实朋友的面貌而不是以死敌的面貌出现在阿拉伯人民的面前。这种论调的目的也在于在人民的心中散布不相信帝国主义根深蒂固的侵略性的种子，以便为另一种思想扫清道路。这种思想就是认为帝国主义可能革面洗心，帝国主义可能和各国人民走在一起，而不反对各国人民。这样，人民的觉悟就会受到麻醉，他们的抵抗力就会减退，神圣的仇恨就会削弱，帝国主义的深入和渗透就有可能，从而为帝国主义制造便利条件，让它来打击解放了的阿拉伯民族主义和施加它的控制，伸展它的势力。
    帝国主义以执行“分而治之”的政治而知名。但是有时我们也看到它采取另一种政策。密切注视政治事件的人们，有时也会被这种政策所蒙蔽。某些灵通的阿拉伯人士，曾经揭露过一项反对在阿曼和南阿拉伯各地进行流血斗争的阿拉伯民族主义的文件。这项文件的内容是，准备一个控制南阿拉伯的条约草案，这项条约规定在各个“保护地”、酋长国建立一个联邦，包括贝汉酋长国，阿瓦兹勒苏丹国，法兹利苏丹国，达黎酋长国，上阿瓦利革酋长国，下亚菲苏丹国；但是必须保证英国在政治上、军事上和经济上完全控制这个所谓联邦，并允许英国军队在“联邦”各地驻扎。帝国国义搞这一套玩意儿是指望欺骗阿拉伯各国人民和把他们推向一条以联邦幌子作掩护的危险的帝国主义道路。帝国主义曾经幻想这套玩意儿能在阿拉伯各国人民面前得到通过，因为联邦是一个很引人的广告。但是南方的阿拉伯人民拒绝了这一帝国主义条约，决心要反对它，决心消灭联邦思想，并决心反对帝国主义到底。也门国王代表肯定地指出了，也门谴责旨在建立一个包括阿拉伯半岛南部各个“保护地”的联邦的英帝国主义计划。他说，也门认为这一计划明目张胆地破坏了英国在1934年的条约和1951年的协定中的诺言，并且认为这个条约威胁也门王国的安全。
    这项计划是在欺骗和诽谤攻势中来到的，这项计划是在企图使帝国主义改头换面地进行欺骗和诽谤攻势中来到的，是在企图给帝国主义的肮脏面孔搽胭抹粉的一系列帝国主义声明中来到的，是在帝国主义集团所策划的访问和会谈中来到的。这项计划是在阿拉伯祖国各部分的战斗趋于激烈之后，阿拉伯民族主义兴起之后，伊拉克共和国巍然出现并高举了阿拉伯和民族主义旗帜以后来到的。帝国主义的船只已经破烂不堪。铲除了帝国主义君主制度的7月14日的革命把他们打得懵头转向。必须肯定的是，这个计划是伴同着阿拉伯世界这一地区的爱国积极分子所遭受的残杀、迫害、逮捕甚至集体屠杀而来的，伴同假造选举而来的。假造这种选举的目的是要通过一些网罗帝国主义议员的“议会”来实施这一计划。
    消息报道，英国军队已经举行了最大规模的攻击，使用着海、陆、空全部武器，向阿曼民族战士的据点，向绿山附近的和平村庄进攻。英国炮队使用大量燃烧弹和摧毁性的炮弹轰击手无寸铁的和平居民。巨大的爆炸声在很远的村庄都可以听到。帝国主义政策没有什么新东西，恐怖、诽谤和撒谎总是它的每一个计划的第一步。让我们回想一下，他们曾经怎样企图以恐怖政策，迫害叙利亚、约旦和伊拉克的自由人，来实行大叙利亚计划。让我们回忆一下，帝国主义者曾经怎样利用监牢和逮捕，在伊拉克和约旦的大街小巷放枪射击，来实行约旦—伊拉克联邦计划。
    在一些西方国家的首都决定各国人民命运的时代已经一去不复返了。代理人、卖国贼和阴谋家再也不能执行那些有金字招牌的计划了。他们执行这一计划的目的原本是要掠夺独立的阿拉伯各国人民的最宝贵的东西即他们的独立和自由；原本是要削弱为独立和自由而进行斗争的阿拉伯人民的抵抗。消息传来，阿曼教长国代表萨拉赫·哈尔塞亲王在印度发表演说，宣布阿曼人民为争取建立一个进步的民主社会而斗争；而英帝国主义者则企图把封建的、反动的独裁强加于阿曼。伊拉克共和国已经支援了阿曼人民的事业，它将继续支援这些事业，因为这是它自己的事业。代表着伊拉克各个阶层和民族的意志的伊拉克共和国，将继续支援每一个解放运动。因为它相信各国人民自决的权利；因为它拒绝同帝国主义妥协和讨价还价；因为每个阿拉伯人民的斗争都是解放了的阿拉伯民族主义的斗争。阿拉伯各国人民将继续是保持警惕的和有觉悟的。一切阴谋都躲不过它的眼睛，一切具有引人的漂亮名字的计划都骗不了它。民主、民族独立和承认人民自决权是导向合法目标的道路。独裁、恐怖、奴役和否认人民的自决权利，是我们的敌人，是全体阿拉伯人的敌人。因为这些东西只能对帝国主义和犹太复国主义有利。
