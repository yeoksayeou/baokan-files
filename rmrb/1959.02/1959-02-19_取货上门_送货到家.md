    Door-to-Door Pickup, Home Delivery
    The Yimianpo Station of the Mudanjiang Railway Bureau has broken with the long-standing railway freight practice by implementing a new freight system of "door-to-door pickup and home delivery," allowing cargo owners to receive both shipped and delivered goods without leaving their homes.
    Previously, the procedures for cargo owners to ship and pick up goods were very complicated. Now, they only need to make a phone call to the station's freight office, and a cargo handler will bring a horse-drawn carriage to pick up the goods. After the delivered goods arrive, the handler will notify the cargo owner to prepare space and deliver the goods to the owner's home on the same day.

    取货上门  送货到家
    牡丹江铁路局一面坡车站打破多年来的铁路货运常规，实行“取货上门，送货到家”的新的货运制度，货主不必出门就可以收到托运和运走发送的货物了。
    从前货主发货取货手续很繁杂。现在只要给车站货运处打个电话，货物接运员就带马车去取货物。运到的货物，接运员在到达后就通知货主准备地方，当天把货物送到货主家里。
