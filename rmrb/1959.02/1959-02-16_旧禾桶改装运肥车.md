    Old Rice Bucket Reconfigured as Fertilizer Transport Vehicle
    In order to deliver fertilizer to the fields as quickly as possible, the Baijia People's Commune in Wan'an County, Jiangxi Province, mobilized its members to actively reform fertilizer transport tools. After the members brainstormed and devised solutions, they used old rice buckets to reconfigure fertilizer transport vehicles, greatly improving fertilizer transport efficiency and saving labor.
    The method for reconfiguring old rice buckets into vehicles is very simple: Use the original old rice bucket as the carriage, install four wheels under the rice bucket, open a fertilizer discharge door on the wall of the rice bucket, and tie ropes and a center brace to the two small holes in the rice bucket to make a vehicle. Each vehicle only needs to be pulled by one ox and driven by one person, and each vehicle can carry more than 3,000 pounds, which is more than ten times more efficient than a cart pushed by manpower. After this type of vehicle was made, it was very popular among the masses. At present, this commune has reconfigured more than twenty vehicles, which are rushing fertilizer to the fields, and can save more than 190 laborers. (He Longcheng)

    旧禾桶改装运肥车
    江西万安县百加人民公社，为了早日将肥料送到田间，发动社员积极改革运肥工具。经过社员们动脑筋、想办法，利用旧禾桶改装成运肥车，大大提高了运肥效率，节省了人力。
    旧禾桶改装车子，方法很简单：利用原来旧禾桶做车箱，在禾桶底下安上四个轮子，又在禾桶墙上开个出肥门，再将禾桶两个小眼系上绳和中桠，就成了车子。每辆车只需一条牛拉，一人赶着，一车可装三十多担，比人力推的车子效率要提高十多倍。这种车子制成后，很受群众欢迎。目前这个社已改装成二十多辆，正在向田间赶运肥料，并可节省一百九十多个劳动力。（何龙乘）
