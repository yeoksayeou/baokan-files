Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 31st: In order to mobilize the people to boost greater enthusiasm and strive for a greater leap forward this year, the Party organizations of Hubei Province recently analyzed the province's favorable conditions for this year's leap forward through the Provincial Party Congress. They also decided to immediately launch a large-scale production movement centered on planting red flags and holding competitions throughout the province.

The 3rd session of the 1st Hubei Provincial Party Congress was held in Wuchang from January 22nd to 25th. Prior to this, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of the first secretaries of the local Party committees, county Party committees, and people's commune Party committees from January 15th to 24th. At this meeting, Comrade Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a work report on behalf of the Provincial Committee. The representatives approved his report and made a resolution.

During the meeting, the representatives conscientiously studied the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The meeting believed that this year's leap forward has more favorable conditions than 1958: First, the rural areas of the entire province have realized the people's commune system; second, the practice of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 created unprecedentedly rich experience; third, through the practice of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the socialist and communist consciousness of the entire Party and all the people has been raised to an unprecedented level; and as production develops, people's lives have also improved to a certain extent; fourth, based on the development of production and the people's commune system, the funds, agricultural tools, and equipment of most people's communes have improved compared to the spring of 1958. Therefore, as long as we make full use of these conditions, as long as the entire Party and all the people continue to exert great efforts and strive for excellence, combining soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis, and combining practical work, hard work, and skillful work, this year's tasks can definitely be completed and overfulfilled.

The meeting requested that a large-scale production movement centered on planting red flags and holding competitions be immediately launched throughout the province. By evaluating merits and commending models, the red flags of advanced units and advanced individuals who made significant achievements in the Great Leap Forward in 1958 should be raised high, so that everyone can follow the red flags and learn from the red flags, thereby deeply and widely launching a competition upsurge. On this basis, potential should be tapped, loopholes should be checked, and a production plan for 1959 should be formulated to carry out the Great Production Movement in a vigorous and solid manner. During the discussions at the meeting, revolutionary competitions were launched between various special districts and counties, and also between various people's communes. The entire meeting was filled with an atmosphere of revolutionary heroism.

The meeting proposed that the following three major tasks in current production should be grasped in the rural areas on the basis of grasping Party rectification and commune consolidation: First, do a good job in the field management of summer crops, break the notion of fixed outcomes, and eliminate third-class seedlings; second, vigorously engage in manure accumulation, and launch a mass manure accumulation movement from urban to rural areas; third, repair agricultural tools, so that agricultural tools and other production means should be available and production is not delayed by lack of tools.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 31st: The 3rd session of the 1st Fujian Provincial Party Congress, which was held recently, called on all Communist Party members and cadres in the province to further consult with the masses on everything, launch a wider and deeper mass movement in the new year, and strive for a greater leap forward this year.

The meeting conveyed and discussed the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, summarized the experiences of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1958, and put forward the task of achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in the province this year. Prior to the meeting, a 20-day enlarged meeting of the Provincial Committee, attended by secretaries of prefectural (municipal) and county Party committees, was convened. At this meeting, Comrade Ye Fei, First Secretary of the Provincial Committee, delivered a report on behalf of the Provincial Committee.

In order to further change the economic landscape of Fujian, the meeting preliminarily discussed and determined the targets for the development of the national economy in Fujian Province in 1959, and put forward a series of important measures. The meeting pointed out that consolidating and improving the people's communes is the central task of the Party in rural areas at present. In the process of commune consolidation, socialist and communist ideological education should be carried out extensively and deeply. At present, it is necessary to establish a production responsibility system for the communes, quickly mobilize commune members to formulate annual production plans, properly arrange labor, and make preparations for spring plowing and various productions. While focusing on production, it is also necessary to focus on livelihood. At present, it is first necessary to do a good job in planned grain consumption, ensuring that grain is not wasted and that people can eat their fill and eat well. The communes must guarantee the completion of the state grain purchase plan. Dining halls, nurseries, and homes for the elderly should continue to be run well.

The Party Congress pointed out that Fujian Province is located on the frontline of national defense and bears the arduous and glorious task of fighting the enemy. The people of the entire province should continue to fully support the frontline and strive for the liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu.

The farming season in Fujian Province is now very pressing. The meeting emphasized that agricultural production must be given great attention and full preparations must be made for spring plowing. A vigorous manure accumulation movement should be launched, and the general farmland should achieve the goal of applying 500 dan of fertilizer per year. At the same time, sweet potatoes and sugarcane should be rushed to harvest, salt production should be seized, orchard management should be done well, the production of mountainous local specialties and diverse economic crops should be vigorously developed, preparations for afforestation should be made, vegetable and livestock production should continue to be expanded, and spring fishing production should be done well. In terms of industrial production, it is necessary to vigorously support key factories and mines in terms of labor and raw materials. At the same time, all localities should seize the construction of "small foreign-style" steel bases.

The meeting believed that in order to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the Party's leadership, implement political command, implement the mass line, and vigorously carry out mass movements. The meeting emphasized that all Party members and cadres should carry forward the Party's traditional style of the mass line, insist on consulting with the masses on everything, further strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses, and always explain the Party's tasks and the methods of completing the tasks to the masses, and listen to the opinions of the masses. The meeting requested that cadres eat, live, and labor with the masses as ordinary laborers; and that they care about the production of the masses and also care about the lives of the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, January 31st: The 3rd session of the 1st Anhui Provincial Party Congress was held from January 21st to 24th. In accordance with the spirit of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the meeting summarized the achievements and experiences of various construction undertakings in the province last year, and mobilized the entire Party and the people of Anhui to continue to boost greater enthusiasm to ensure that the province's socialist construction undertakings will have a greater and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

The meeting was first addressed by Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Provincial Committee, on behalf of the Provincial Committee. In the discussions, the representatives unanimously agreed that the leadership of the Provincial Committee since the last congress has been correct. In the past year, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and under the brilliant illumination of the general line for socialist construction, all Party members and the people of Anhui Province have displayed soaring revolutionary enthusiasm and have achieved unprecedentedly great victories in industry, agriculture, cultural education, and other fronts. The representatives believed that the Provincial Committee's work report's assessment of the achievements of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in Anhui Province in 1958 was correct, and that the summarized experiences and lessons learned are of great significance for future work. In their discussions, the representatives all related to the actual situation of their own regions, and made detailed discussions on the experiences and lessons learned in last year's work and the work tasks for this year. They were full of confidence in completing this year's socialist construction tasks.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, January 31st: The 3rd session of the 1st Party Congress of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which was held recently, emphasized the need to vigorously strengthen the Party's unified and centralized leadership, implement political command, and, on the premise of "the whole country as a single chessboard," achieve a greater leap forward in the autonomous region this year to cooperate with the country's construction.

The meeting was held in Hohhot from January 12th to 17th. At the meeting, Ulanhu, First Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a report entitled "Strive for a Greater, Better, and More Comprehensive Leap Forward in Socialist Construction in 1959."

In accordance with the spirit of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, and combined with the characteristics of the Inner Mongolia region and the characteristics of the ethnic groups, the meeting required that, first of all, on the premise of "the whole country as a single chessboard," and taking steel as the key, vigorously develop steel production centered on Baotou Steel, comprehensively arrange other industrial and agricultural production, and accelerate the construction of the autonomous region in all aspects to cooperate with the country's construction. The meeting requested that agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production continue to have a great leap forward in 1959. Implement the basic farmland system and strive to basically pass the agricultural hurdle. Animal husbandry should be developed in accordance with the direction of combining agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. The measures for developing animal husbandry are: water (water conservancy), grass (forage and feed), reproduction (improve reproduction rate and survival rate), improvement (improve breeds), prevention (prevent and control animal diseases and various disasters), tools (tool reform), management (feeding management), and sheds (build sheds and pens), etc., and should be comprehensively promoted in accordance with local conditions.

In order to realize the plan for 1959, the Party Congress requested that the masses be mobilized in depth, exert great efforts, strive for excellence, and mobilize the enthusiasm of the entire Party and all the people. In order to strive for Baotou Steel to produce iron, steel, and steel products as early as possible this year, the meeting requested that in addition to the unified dispatch and arrangement by the state, Baotou Steel should strengthen the Party's leadership, strengthen the frontline, twist into a rope, vigorously carry out mass movements, and give full play to potential forces. All parts of Inner Mongolia should go all out to support the construction of Baotou Steel in all possible aspects. In order to strengthen the Party's unified and centralized leadership and thoroughly rectify the work style of cadres, the meeting required that the working methods of political command and the Party's mass line must be implemented. Only when the Party's centralized and unified leadership is further strengthened and the work style of cadres is further improved can the realization of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959 be guaranteed.

    湖北省在1月22日到25日在武昌举行了党的第一届代表大会第三次会议。在这之前，中共湖北省委在1月15日到24日召开了全省各地委、县委、人民公社党委第一书记会议。在这次会议上，中共湖北省委第一书记王任重同志代表省委作了工作报告，代表们同意他的报告，并且作出了决议。
    会议期间，代表们认真学习了党的八届六中全会决议。会议认为，今年的跃进有着较1958年更为优越的条件：第一，全省农村已经实现人民公社化；第二，1958年大跃进的实践，创造了空前丰富的经验；第三，经过1958年大跃进的实践，全党全民的社会主义、共产主义觉悟空前提高；并且随着生产的发展，人民的生活也有了一定的改善；第四，在生产发展和人民公社化的基础上，大多数人民公社的资金和农具、设备等，都比1958年春天有所改善。因此，只要充分利用这些条件，只要全党全民继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，把冲天的干劲和科学分析结合起来，把实干、苦干、巧干结合起来，今年的任务就一定可以完成和超额完成。
    会议要求在全省范围内立即开展一个以插红旗、搞竞赛为中心的大规模的生产运动。通过评功表模把1958年大跃进中有显著成绩的先进单位、先进人物的红旗高高举起，让大家跟红旗走，向红旗学习，从而深入、广泛地展开竞赛热潮，在这个基础上，挖潜力，查漏洞，订出1959年生产规划，把大生产运动开展得轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实。在会议讨论中，各专区、各县之间就展开了革命竞赛，各人民公社之间也展开了竞赛。整个会议洋溢着革命英雄主义的热烈气氛。
    会上提出，当前农村中应当在大抓整党、整社工作的基础上，抓好当前生产上的三件大事：第一，搞好夏收作物的田间管理，打破定局论，消灭三类苗；第二，大搞积肥，从城镇到农村，开展群众性的积肥运动；第三，修整农具，让农具等生产，不要让生产等农具。

    党的代表大会指出，福建省地处祖国海防前线，担负着艰巨光荣的对敌斗争任务，全省人民应当继续全力支援前线，为解放台、澎、金、马而努力。
    福建省现在农事季节已很紧迫，会议强调当前必须大抓农业生产，充分作好春耕准备。要大力开展积肥运动，一般农田要实现全年施肥五百担的计划。同时要突击抢收蕃薯，抢收甘蔗，抓紧进行盐业生产，搞好果园管理，大力发展山区土特产和多种经济作物的生产；作好造林准备工作；继续扩大蔬菜生产和畜牧生产；搞好春汛渔业生产。在工业生产方面，必须从劳力上、原材料上大力支援重点厂矿，同时各地要抓紧“小洋群”钢铁基地的建设。
    会议认为，要实现1959年更大更好更全面的跃进，必须继续加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，贯彻群众路线，大搞群众运动。会议强调，全体党员和全体干部要发扬党的群众路线的传统作风，坚持作到有事和群众商量，进一步密切党和群众的联系，经常把党的任务和完成任务的方法向群众交代清楚，倾听群众意见。会议要求，干部要以普通劳动者的身份和群众同吃同住同劳动；既关心群众的生产、又关心群众的生活。

    内蒙古
    据新华社呼和浩特31日电　内蒙古自治区最近举行的党的第一届代表大会第三次会议，强调要大力加强党的统一集中领导，贯彻政治挂帅，在“全国一盘棋”的前提下，实现自治区今年更大的跃进，配合全国的建设。
    这次会议从1月12日到17日在呼和浩特举行。会上，中共内蒙古自治区委员会第一书记乌兰夫作了“为争取1959年社会主义建设更大、更好、更全面的跃进而奋斗”的报告。

    为实现1959年的计划，党的代表大会要求深入发动群众，鼓足干劲、力争上游，发动全党全民的积极性。为了争取包钢今年尽早出铁、出钢和钢材，会议要求除了国家统一调度安排以外，包钢应当加强党的领导，加强第一线，拧成一股绳，大搞群众运动，发挥潜在力量。内蒙古各地应当全力以赴，在一切可能的方面支援包钢建设。为了加强党的统一集中领导，彻底整顿干部作风，会议要求必须贯彻政治挂帅和党的群众路线的工作方法，只有党的集中统一的领导进一步加强了，干部的作风进一步改进了，实现1959年更大、更好、更全面的跃进才有保证。
