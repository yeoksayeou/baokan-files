Jottings on Chao Shan
    Chao Shan is a good place. People from Chao Shan say so themselves, and outsiders spread the word. The summer before last, I walked on the roads of Chao Shan for the first time, and felt an indescribable sense of joy. It was truly:

    Rows of flamboyant trees blooming with red flowers, rows of paddy fields reflecting lotus blossoms,
    Rows of goose flocks belonging to the cooperative, rows of horse-drawn carriages like flowing water.

    The Chao Shan Plain is located on the southern coast of the motherland. The scenery of the plain, the scenery of the seaside, and the subtropical scenery are very harmoniously interwoven. Because it is a plain, it is open and vast; because it is on the seaside, it is magnificent; because it is located in the subtropical zone, it is prosperous.

    My hometown is in the mountainous area of Fujian. Two folk songs have always been circulating there:

    White sugar is delicious from Chaozhou,
    Spring water is delicious from stone crevices,
    The girl is white sugar, the boy is water,
    White sugar and spring water are bound together.

    Chaozhou tangerines, Hangzhhou pears,
    The boy eats the tangerine, the girl peels it,
    The girl is just like the tangerine,
    One is enough for the boy.

    Both are love songs. Using white sugar and spring water as metaphors for beloved girls is natural and appropriate. In the past, I only read them as love songs, but now I realize that these two love songs also hide the deep affection of the people of my hometown for Chao Shan.

    Yes, the mountain people should thank the seaside people. In the past, every household in my hometown needed salt, my grandmother loved to eat salted fish, and tangerines were my favorite when I was a child... all came from Chao Shan. When I was a child, I could never forget one thing: when I heard that the Japanese devils had attacked Chao Shan, everyone lost their appetite and couldn't sleep, and I felt sad too. From then on, there were fewer seafood products in the markets of my hometown. It wasn't until after the victory that my grandmother was able to eat salted fish again.

    Now, most of the tangerines, salted fish and other goods in the markets of my hometown come from southern Fujian, but the older generation still think they come from Chao Shan. For example, tangerines are universally called "Chao Tangerines".

    The mountain people also generously repay the seaside people. Every year, a lot of paper, wood, pears, water chestnuts... flow down the Ting River to the Han River.

    Thinking of Chao Shan tangerines, I think of Chao Shan drawnwork embroidery. Drawnwork embroidery is the honor and pride of Chao Shan. Poets love it because of its clean elegance; artists love it because of its variety; girls love it because of its exquisite beauty; lovers love it because it can gently contain a sea-like deep affection.

    It is precious, but it is approachable. It can be your dress, it can be your pillow mat, it can be your shawl, handkerchief...

    As a commodity, it is good and cheap; as a daily necessity, it is elegant and practical. It is both an ornament and a work of art.

    Such a thing cannot but be praised by everyone and enjoy a global reputation.

    Such a thing can only come from clever minds and skillful hands. When I say clever mind, I mean the heart of a poet; when I say skillful hand, I mean the hand of a painter.

    Poets and painters - this is the girl from Chao Shan.

    I think that paying attention to hygiene is one of the advantages of the Chao Shan people. Taking the town of Anbu, where I live, as an example, many families have wells. The well water is very close to the ground, making it very convenient to fetch. Easy access to water promotes hygiene. For example, the floors of most people's homes here are paved with large square red bricks, with lime applied in the gaps. Every ten days or half a month, they are washed with well water. Therefore, the floors of many people's homes are almost shiny enough to reflect light, and clean enough to sit on the floor.

    Last year, the Chao Shan people banished the domestic gods and wild ghosts. Removing shrines and leveling graves became a movement. Breaking superstitions and eliminating bad habits resulted in the Great Leap Forward, a bumper harvest, and many happy events. This year, we are taking it to the next level: the Shantou area will become a "30 billion jin area"; and Chao An, the first thousand-jin county for rice in our country, will strive for seven "national firsts" on the agricultural front this year!

    潮汕走笔
    徐风
    潮汕是好地方。潮汕人自己这样说，外乡人这样口口相传。前年夏天，我第一次走在潮汕道上，感到说不出的心旷神怡。正是：
    一路的开红花的凤凰树，一路的水稻映着莲花，
    一路的合作社的鹅群，一路的流水般的马车。
    潮汕平原在祖国南方海岸。平原的景色、海边的景色、亚热带的景色非常和谐地交织在一起。因为是平原，所以它开阔；因为在海边，所以它壮丽；因为地处亚热带，所以它繁华。
    我的家乡在福建山区。那里一直流传着两首民歌：
    白糖好食潮州来，
    泉水好食石缝来，
    妹是白糖哥是水，
    白糖泉水结缘来。
    潮州柑子上杭梨，
    郎食柑子妹剥皮，
    老妹好比柑子样，
    哥有一个够得哩。
    两首都是情歌。把白糖、泉水比喻心爱的姑娘，自然而得体。过去我只把它们当情歌读，现在才领会到这两首情歌里还隐藏着故乡人对潮汕的一片深情。
    是的，山里人是应该感谢海边人的。过去，家乡家家户户少不了的食盐，祖母爱吃的咸鱼，我小时候最喜欢的柑子……都是从潮汕来的。小时候有一件事我总是不能遗忘：听说日本鬼子打到了潮汕，大家都食不甘味，寝不安席，我也跟着难过起来。从此家乡市场上就少有海味。直到胜利后，祖母才又吃上了咸鱼。
    现在，家乡市场上的柑子、咸鱼等货物，多是从闽南来的，但老辈人仍以为它们来自潮汕。例如柑子，就一律被称为“潮柑”。
    山里人也慷慨地答谢海边人。每年，很多纸张、木材、梨子、荸荠……从汀江转韩江，顺流而下。
    想到潮汕的柑子，我联想到潮汕的抽纱。抽纱，这是潮汕的荣誉和骄傲。诗人爱它，因了它的洁雅不俗；艺术家爱它，因了它的多采多姿；少女爱它，因了它的玲珑美丽；恋人们爱它，因了它能够轻轻地包藏起海一样的深情。
    它是珍贵的，但它平易近人。它可以是你的衣裙，可以是你的枕席，可以是你的披肩、手绢……
    作为商品，它物美价廉；作为用品，它雅观实惠。它是装饰品，也是艺术品。
    这样的东西，不能不人人称赞，誉满全球。
    这样的东西，只能出于巧心妙手。我说巧心，指的是诗人的心；我说妙手，指的是画家的手。
    诗人和画家——这便是潮汕姑娘。
    我觉得，讲究卫生正是潮汕人的一个优点。以我居住的庵埠镇来说，很多人家都有井。井水离地极近，取用十分方便。取水容易，就促使人讲究卫生。举个例来说：这里一般人家的地板，都用大方块红砖铺成，缝间涂以石灰。每隔十天半月，就用井水冲洗一次。因此，很多人家的地板都几乎光亮得可以照人，干净得可以席地而坐。
    去年，潮汕人放逐了家神野鬼。除神坛、平坟地曾经成为一次运动。破除迷信，革除陋俗，结果是大跃进、大丰收、喜事重重。今年更上一层楼：汕头专区要成为“三百亿斤专区”；而我国第一个水稻千斤县潮安，今年在农业战线上要争取七个“全国第一”！
