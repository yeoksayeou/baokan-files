    Great Leap Forward in One Year, Greatly Improved Awareness
    Hebei Emerges with a Million Advanced Figures
    (Our Dispatch) During the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and the movement for people's communes, Hebei Province emerged with more than one million advanced figures. These comrades dared to think, dared to act, worked selflessly, took the lead actively, and were selfless, receiving universal praise from the commune members.
    According to incomplete statistics from various special districts and cities throughout the province (one special district missing), more than 1,180,000 advanced figures from all walks of life emerged in the past year. Among these advanced figures praised by the masses, Party member cadres in grassroots organizations accounted for a considerable number. In Xianghe County alone, more than 2,000 cadres and Party members were praised. In Wawali Wang Township, Jiaocheng County, grassroots cadres elected by commune members accounted for about one-tenth of the total number of people praised. Li Dianzhong, the Party branch secretary of Zhao Lian Zhuang Production Team in Tuanbowa People's Commune, Jinghai County, led the masses to wash and irrigate rice seedlings overnight during the spring drought-resistant rice seedling cultivation; when the irrigation canal breached, he took the lead in jumping into the water to rush and block the breach, and was praised by the masses as a "capable general". Wang Guofan, the leader of the "Poor Stick" cooperative in Zunhua County, which started with three donkey legs, united and persuaded commune members to establish a people's commune together with other cooperatives, bringing with them more than 300,000 yuan of public accumulation during the communization movement.
    The exemplary deeds of these advanced figures have been valued by the masses. In some counties of Handan Special District, the masses widely publicized these advanced figures and exemplary deeds in the form of big-character posters, Halls of Glory, Lists of Glory, blackboard newspapers, and rooftop broadcasts. Commune members of Dou Village Production Team in Xiaofan People's Commune, Xian County, compiled more than 2,000 folk songs and fast-clapping rhymes about the exemplary deeds of the advanced figures in their team.
    The million-plus advanced figures in Hebei Province have set an example for the vast number of commune members, and a movement to learn from and catch up with the advanced has been launched in many places.

    一年大跃进觉悟大提高
    河北涌现百万先进人物
    本报讯　在农业生产大跃进和人民公社化运动中，河北省曾涌现出一百多万名先进人物。这些同志敢想敢干，忘我劳动，积极带头，大公无私，受到社员普遍的表扬。
    据全省各专区、市（缺一个专区）的不完全统计，在去年一年当中，涌现出各行各业的先进人物有一百一十八万多名。这些受到群众表扬的先进人物当中，基层组织的党员干部占有相当的数量。仅香河一个县，受到表扬的干部党员即有两千多人。交河县洼里王乡社员群众评选的基层干部约占受表扬总人数的十分之一。静海县团泊洼人民公社赵连庄生产队总支书记李殿忠在春天抗旱育秧时，带领群众连夜趁雨淘水浇稻秧；引水道决口时，带头跳到水里抢堵决口，被群众誉为“干将”。遵化县以三条驴腿起家的“穷棒子”社的领导人王国藩，在公社化运动中团结说服社员群众带着三十多万元的公共积累和别的社一起建立人民公社。
    这些先进人物的模范事迹，得到了群众的重视。邯郸专区部分县的群众把这些先进人物和模范事迹，用大字报、光荣台、光荣榜、黑板报、屋顶广播等形式，广泛传颂。献县小范人民公社豆村生产队的社员群众，将本队先进人物的模范事迹，编写了歌谣快板二千多首。
    河北省的百余万先进人物为广大社员树立了榜样，在许多地方开展起学先进赶先进的运动。
