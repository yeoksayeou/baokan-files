The Oriental Red People's Commune in Heishan County, Liaoning Province, has adopted the method of rapid manure burning with "one stove and multiple holes" in the fields, which is fast and produces good quality manure. The specific method is as follows: use a hoe to dig two small ditches on the ground, spaced eight inches apart, and then dig a transverse ditch stove in the middle (similar to a kang hole, but with two fewer holes than a kang hole). Then use soil blocks to build the kang hole and lay the kang surface, which is about two meters wide, about two feet high, and the length is determined by the width of the land. The stove entrance should be left according to the wind direction, generally facing the wind to start the fire. This way, the smoke does not escape, and it does not destroy the organic matter in the soil. (Originally published in Liaoning Daily)

    一灶多洞熏肥快又好
    辽宁黑山县东方红人民公社采用田间“一灶多洞”的快速烧粪法，烧粪快、质量好。具体作法是：用镐头在地上扒两条小沟，间隔八寸，中间再横扒一道沟灶（类似炕洞，比炕洞少两个洞），然后用土块垒成炕洞和搭上炕面，宽约二公尺左右、高二尺上下，长度根据地的宽窄决定，灶坑口要看风向留，一般是迎风点火。这样烧不跑烟，还不破坏土壤的有机质。（原载辽宁日报）
