    East Rainbow Sun, West Rainbow Rain
    --Talking About Supplementary Weather Forecasts
    Li Ke
    The recent National Meteorological Bureau Directors Conference decided that all stations, posts, and sentry points nationwide should carry out supplementary forecasts to continuously improve forecast accuracy. What is a supplementary weather forecast? How do you make supplementary weather forecasts?

    Supplementary weather forecasting is a method combining modern meteorological science with the weather experience of the working people, developed by the masses and meteorological workers during the Great Leap Forward last year. It involves stations, posts, and teams supplementing and correcting the large-scale weather forecasts released by meteorological observatories, in order to compensate for inaccuracies caused by local weather changes and the influence of topographic and geographical conditions on the weather. This combination of indigenous and foreign methods greatly improves forecast accuracy, allowing weather forecasts to better serve production and construction.

    The weather forecasts of meteorological observatories can help people understand the temperature and pressure distribution in the air over a certain area, as well as the current weather conditions in various places. Although the influence of terrain and other geographical conditions is considered, the geographical area covered is too large, making the forecasts inevitably rather crude. Even if the predictions are completely accurate, they cannot completely meet the actual conditions of each place. For example, under the same weather conditions, the weather in the mountainous areas and plains of Beijing may be completely different.

    The methods of supplementary forecasting generally include the following:

    According to local weather omens: Before weather changes, there are usually certain omens. For example, strong southerly winds in Beijing in winter are often a sign that snowfall or strong winds are about to arrive. A place can make supplementary weather forecasts based on the shape of the local clouds, changes in wind direction, air turbidity, and changes in temperature, pressure, and humidity, combined with local experience.

    According to weather proverbs: Some concise weather proverbs can also help make supplementary forecasts. For example, "If the south wind blows to the end, the north wind will return the courtesy," "The northwest wind unlocks the sky," "Yellow sky means rain, yellow face means illness," "Look southeast in the morning, northwest in the evening," "East rainbow sun, west rainbow rain"... etc., have very high accuracy when used in certain areas. However, because weather proverbs have a certain regionality, you should consult with experienced farmers and people when using them for the first time.

    According to the performance of some objects: For example, in summer, ponds and water tanks turn muddy, fish gather in schools on the surface of the water, dragonflies and swallows fly low, arthritis flares up, etc., all can predict the approach of heavy rain or bad weather.

    According to climate data: For example, what important weather conditions occur in the local area during a certain month, how many times a type of weather appears, how long is the time interval, what are the manifestations of pressure, temperature, humidity, wind, and clouds before the weather changes. After sorting this out, it can be used as an important reference for supplementary forecasting.

    According to weather broadcasts from several neighboring radio stations: If you know the weather broadcast times of neighboring areas, you can widely listen to and record them for comprehensive analysis and comparison. This method of pooling wisdom can also achieve good results.

    After supplementary weather forecasts penetrate into rural areas and factories and mines, they can also focus on work in conjunction with production needs. Supplementary weather forecasting is not difficult to do, and all walks of life can carry it out. It can also be used as an extracurricular activity for students. As long as you pay attention to observation, research and summarize experience, you can do it well. If people can know the weather changes for tomorrow or the next few days, it will be of great benefit to their lives and production.

    东虹日头西虹雨
    ——谈补充气象预报
    李克
    最近举行的全国气象局长会议决定，全国所有的台、站、哨都要开展补充预报，不断提高预报准确率。什么是补充天气预报？怎样做补充天气预报呢？
    补充天气预报是在去年大跃进中，群众和气象工作者运用现代气象科学与劳动人民的气象经验相结合的办法，在气象台发布的大范围气象的基础上，通过站、哨、组，层层补充订正，以弥补由于地方性天气变化和地形地理条件对天气影响而使预报不准的缺陷。这种土洋结合的方法大大地提高了预报准确率，使天气预报更好地为生产建设服务。
    气象台的天气预报，可以帮助人们了解一定地区上空的温度和气压的分布情况和各地的天气现况。这里虽然也注意到地形和其它地理条件的影响，但是因为所包括的地理范围太大，毕竟是相当粗略的。即使是预测的完全正确，也不可能完全满足各个地方的实际情况。例如在同一个天气形势下，北京的山区和平原区的天气可能完全不同。
    补充预报的方法，一般有以下几个：
    根据地方性气象征兆：天气变化以前，一般都有一定的征兆。例如北京冬季较强的偏南风常常是降雪或强风快要到来的征兆。一个地方根据当地云的形状、风向转变、空气的混浊度、气温气压和湿度的变化等，结合当地的经验，就可以做补充天气预报。
    根据天气谚语：一些精炼的天气谚语也可以帮助作补充预报。例如：“南风吹到底，北风来还礼”、“西北风开天锁”、“天黄有雨，人黄有病”、“早看东南，晚看西北”、“东虹日头，西虹雨”……等等，在一定的地区使用起来，都有非常高的准确率。但因天气谚语有着一定的地域性，最初使用时要多向老农和有经验的人请教。
    根据一些物象的表现：例如夏季池塘和水缸翻混，鱼成群浮在水面，蜻蜓和燕子低飞，关节炎发痛，……等等，都能预兆大雨将临或天气变坏。
    根据气候资料：例如当地某月份有那些重要天气情况，一种天气出现多少次数，时间间隔多久，天气变化前气压、温度、湿度、风、云等有那些表现，整理好了就可把它做为重要的参考进行补充预报。
    根据邻近几个广播电台的天气广播：如果掌握了邻近地区天气广播时间，可以广泛地收听记录，进行综合分析和比较。这种集思广益的方法也能收到很好的效果。
    补充天气预报深入农村和工矿以后，它还可以结合生产的需要，有重点地进行工作。补充天气预报并不难做，各行各业都能开展，也可以作为学生的课外活动项目。只要平时多注意观察，研究和总结经验，就能很好地做起来。如果人们都能知道明天或以后几天的天气变化情况，在生活上和生产上都会有莫大的好处。
