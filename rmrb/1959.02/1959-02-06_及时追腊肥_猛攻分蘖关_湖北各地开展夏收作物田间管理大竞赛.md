Hubei, February 5th (by this newspaper) - People's communes in various parts of Hubei Province are further strengthening field management of summer harvest crops while vigorously accumulating fertilizer. A seedling upgrading movement centered on topdressing is unfolding throughout the province. In Xiangyang Special District, which accounts for more than one-third of the province's summer harvest crop area, the labor force invested in field management has increased from over 700,000 to over 900,000. More than 13 million mu of summer harvest crops in this special district have generally received one application of fertilizer, and many third-class seedlings have turned from yellow to green. In Huanggang Special District, about 800,000 people have also been put into field management of summer harvest crops. The district's more than 3.7 million mu of wheat, rapeseed, barley, and beans have also basically received one application of fertilizer and have been weeded once. The current focus for wheat is on applying winter fertilizer to increase tillering and eliminate third-class seedlings before jointing. Based on last year's high-yield wheat experience, Xiangyang Special District is launching a campaign to strive for one million wheat plants per mu, proposing that from now until wheat harvest, it is necessary to firmly grasp "three guarantees," namely, ensuring more ears, larger ears, and full grains.

In Hubei Province, during the seedling upgrading movement for summer harvest crops, the tried and tested methods of planting red flags, catching up with the advanced, conducting large-scale inspections, and holding large-scale evaluations, which proved effective last year, were utilized. Guanghua County is one of the counties in the province with the best cultivation and management of summer harvest crops. The county's 540,000 mu of wheat, barley, broad beans, and peas have generally been weeded three times and fertilized twice, and the third fertilizer application is currently underway. The original more than 60,000 mu of third-class seedlings have grown strong, achieving balanced growth over a large area. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all localities to learn from Guanghua, and a movement to "learn from Guanghua and catch up with Guanghua" was launched throughout the province. In order to catch up with Guanghua, Yun County convened a mobilization meeting attended by more than 3,000 cadres at the production team leader level and above. Huaguo People's Commune had more than 18,000 mu of third-class seedlings. After putting forward the slogan "Guarantee one million plants, catch up with Guanghua County," they applied more than 3 million dan of fertilizer to the third-class seedlings in four days.

Continuous evaluation and inspection, piece-by-piece appraisal, and seedling ranking are good methods for promoting field management. Before and after January 20th, Zhaoyang County organized 5,000 people for a large-scale field inspection and evaluation. After seedling ranking, it was found that there were still about 90,000 mu of third-class seedlings. From county party committee members to cadres above the production team leader level, more than 8,000 people were mobilized, leading a large army of 100,000 for fertilizer accumulation and topdressing, and deploying more than 10,000 vehicles to apply fertilizer to the 90,000 mu of third-class seedlings within six days. Now, reinspections and re-fertilization are underway, striving to make all wheat seedlings first-class. Fengle People's Commune in Zhongxiang County originally did not pay attention to field management of summer harvest crops, and about 70% of the seedlings were third-class. In mid-January, after the entire commune organized more than 900 cadres at the production team leader level and above to conduct evaluations and inspections, more than 20 million dan of fertilizer were accumulated within a week, and more than 90% of the third-class seedlings received one application of fertilizer, most of which have turned from yellow to green.

The superiority of the people's commune has been fully demonstrated in the field management of this year's summer harvest crops. More than 50 counties and more than 100 communes in the province carried out land leveling and continuous plots during winter sowing last year. Due to the continuous plots of crops, clear responsibilities, each doing their best, and increased labor efficiency could be achieved. Some people's communes have also promoted the archiving of field management, ensuring that there are labels at the field head, charts in the team, registers in the brigade, and cards for the commune members. Therefore, the summer harvest crops in many areas of Hubei Province this year are cultivated better and managed more meticulously than in any previous year.

    及时追腊肥　猛攻分蘖关
    湖北各地开展夏收作物田间管理大竞赛
    本报武汉5日电　湖北省各地人民公社在大抓积肥的同时，进一步加强夏收作物的田间管理。一个以追肥为中心内容的禾苗升级运动正在全省范围展开。占全省夏收作物面积三分之一以上的襄阳专区投入田间管理的劳力由原来的七十多万人增加到九十多万人。这个专区的一千三百多万亩夏收作物已普遍追了一道肥，很多三类苗已由黄转青。黄冈专区投入夏收作物田间管理的也有八十万人左右。全区三百七十多万亩小麦、油菜、大麦和豆等也基本上追了一道肥，除了一次草。当前小麦主要是大追腊肥，增加分蘖，把三类苗消灭在拔节前。襄阳专区根据去年小麦丰产经验，正开展争取小麦每亩百万株运动，提出从现在起到麦收，要紧紧抓住“三保”，即保穗多、穗大、籽粒饱满。
    湖北省各地在开展夏收作物禾苗升级运动中，运用了去年行之有效的插红旗，赶先进，大检查，大评比的一套办法。光化县是全省夏收作物培育、管理得最好的县之一。这个县的五十四万亩大、小麦和蚕、豌豆已普遍锄了三道草，追了两道肥，当前正在追第三道肥。原来的六万多亩三类苗已长的肥壮，做到了大面积平衡生长。中共湖北省委号召各地向光化看齐，一个“学光化、赶光化”的运动在全省展开了。郧县为了赶光化，召集生产队长以上的干部三千多人开了个誓师大会。花果人民公社有一万八千多亩三类苗，经提出“保证百万株，赶上光化县”口号后，在四天内给三类苗追了三百多万担肥料。
    不断评比、检查，逐块鉴定，禾苗排队，是促进田间管理的好方法。枣阳县在1月20日前后组织了五千人的田间大检查、大评比，经过禾苗排队，发现还有九万亩左右三类苗。全县县委委员到生产队长以上干部，出动八千多人，带领十万积肥、追肥大军，出动一万多辆车子，在六天内给九万亩三类苗普遍追了一道肥。现在正在再检查，再追肥，力争麦苗一类化。锺祥县丰乐人民公社原来对夏收作物田间管理不重视，三类苗有70％左右。1月中旬，全公社组织生产队长以上干部九百多人评比检查后，一周内便积肥二千多万担，90％以上的三类苗追了一次肥，已大部由黄转青。
    在今年夏收作物的田间管理中，充分显示了人民公社的优越性。全省有五十多个县一百多个公社在去年冬播中进行了土地平整连片，由于作物连片，能做到责任分明，各尽所长，劳动效率提高。有些人民公社还推行了田间管理档案化。做到田头有标签，小队有榜，大队有册，社员有卡片。因此，湖北省很多地区今年的夏收作物较以往任何一年培育得好，管理得细致。
