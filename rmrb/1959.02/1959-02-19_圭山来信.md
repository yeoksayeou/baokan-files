Letter from Guishan
Xu Chi

    One "When you receive this letter, you may be surprised, who is writing to you, and what is written in the letter? Do you remember the young man who accompanied you two summers ago, climbing Guishan, circling Chang Lake, and celebrating the joyous Torch Festival together? Two years have flashed by, and my hometown has undergone great changes: a seventy-li-long trench has been dug in Guishan, and a long tunnel has been opened at Yuan Lake. In the alpine region of Muzhuqing, a Guishan Lake has been built, and the mountains and forests we used to ride horses through have become terraced fields, layer upon layer. Four thousand people are building the Guidian Road, and Sani girls have become pneumatic drill operators. Young men drained the water from Dragon Pool and are building Dragon Mouth in the Adventurous Water Cave..."

    Two My heart immediately flew into the clouds, floated to the Sani people's hometown, and turned into raindrops, when I received the letter from Guishan. Raindrops fall on the majestic Stone Forest, with two rainbows hanging in the rain. Raindrops fall on the hair of my travel companion, and the sunlight after the rain shines on the wet soil. I hurriedly opened the photo album, and the scenery of Chang Lake is again before my eyes. On the photo of the letter writer, I once inscribed four lines of poetry: Beautiful alpine lake, how can you remain forever untouched by human footsteps? Lonely Chang Lake, I'm afraid your noisy days are not far away! Ha! These days have arrived! In that tranquil mountain, where there was only the sound of the large three-stringed instrument in the past, now the pneumatic drill sings aloud.

    Three "Our entire Guishan is one large commune, mainly engaged in industry. Iron smelting plant, coal mine, zinc mine, we have 20,000 workers. Haiyi is building a power station, quite large, and the E’shao Yi village has electric lights. Villages in the mountains will be clustered together, with at least eight hundred households in each village. Yizheng has already started construction, and other villages are preparing. We eat four meals a day, and our life is very sweet. The home of Ashima has many myths, but they are not as rich as today's reality. The beautiful songs left by distant guests are not as magnificent as the songs of the Great Leap Forward. If you can come to Guishan, you will see everything has changed, changing so quickly! You will surely be happy to see it."

    Four Hearing the young man's call, I can't restrain myself any longer. A flock of golden pheasants flew into the mountains, it is my heart flying to Guishan! Guishan was already very beautiful, but now life is even happier. How joyful will this year's Torch Festival be? Listening to the bursts of explosions, Sani girls are opening up the mountains, still wearing white sheep wool, their songs shaking the mountain peaks. We have just crossed the slave society, and socialism is under construction, a life of abundance, in that beautiful scenery. Golden sunshine fills Guishan, I wish to sing in Guishan, to work with the Sani people, when I received the letter from Guishan.

    圭山来信
    徐迟
    一“当你接到这封信，你也许感到惊奇，是谁给你来信，信里写的是什么？可记得前年夏天，有个青年陪伴你，登上圭山，绕过长湖，共庆欢乐的火把节？两个年头一闪过，我的家乡起了大变化：圭山挖出大沟七十里长，圆湖打开长长的大隧道。高寒山区的亩竹箐，修起一面圭山湖，我们骑马经过的山林变成了梯田，累累层层。四千人修圭甸路，撒尼姑娘成了风钻手，小伙子抽干龙潭水，冒水洞里修龙嘴……”
    二我的心立即飞上云堆浮到撒尼人家乡，变成雨丝落下去，当我接到了圭山来信。雨丝落下嵯峨的石林，雨中悬挂两条彩虹，雨丝落在我旅伴的头发上，雨后的阳光照着湿土。我急忙打开贴照簿，长湖风光又在眼前，在来信人的照片上，我曾经题过诗四句：美丽的高原湖呵，怎末能永远人迹罕至？寂寞的长湖呵，恐怕你喧闹的日子已经不
  远！嗨！这日子来啦！在那宁静的山里，从前只有大三弦的弦音，现在风钻放声歌唱。
    三“我们全圭山一个大公社，主要就是搞工业。炼铁厂，采煤厂，锌矿厂，我们工人有两万人。海邑正建电站，相当大，额勺衣村点电灯。山林里的村子要聚居，每村至少八百户。宜政已经开工建筑，别的村都在筹备。我们一天吃四餐，生活过的很甜蜜。阿诗玛家乡神话多，不及当今现实更丰富，远方客人留下来的歌声美，不及跃进歌声更宏伟。如果你能来圭山，就会看到一切变啦，变得飞快飞快呵，你看了一定会高兴。”
    四听到那小伙子的呼唤，我按耐不住我自己啦，一群锦鸡飞进了山林，是我的心飞去圭山啦。圭山本已很美丽，如今生活更幸福，今年过起火把节来，更不知如何欢乐？听一阵阵爆炸声，撒尼姑娘在开山，依然披着白羊毛，她们的歌声把山峰震荡。奴隶社会刚跨过，社会主义在建设中，丰衣足食的生活，在那美丽的风景里。金色的阳光照满了圭山，歌唱我愿在圭山唱，愿和撒尼人一同劳动，当我接到了圭山来信。
