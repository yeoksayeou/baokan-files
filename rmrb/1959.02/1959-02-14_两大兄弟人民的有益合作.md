Beneficial Cooperation Between Two Great Brotherly Peoples
A. Arkhipov, Vice Chairman of the State Committee of the Council of Ministers of the USSR for Foreign Economic Relations

    The people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are celebrating the ninth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty on Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with great joy. This treaty eternally consolidates the fraternal friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples and lays a solid foundation for the comprehensive development of political, economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries.
    The friendship between our great peoples has brought remarkable results, and the smooth development of economic cooperation between our two countries is an indisputable proof of this. This cooperation is of particular importance now that the peaceful competition between socialism and capitalism in material production is entering a new and decisive stage. As Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in his report to the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the union of productive forces of socialist countries provides new and greater possibilities for the entire socialist camp and every socialist country to develop production.
    Soviet-Chinese economic cooperation is diverse, manifesting itself in foreign trade, assistance in the construction of industrial enterprises, and the mutual exchange of scientific and technological achievements. According to various Sino-Soviet agreements, the Soviet Union is helping China build 211 large-scale projects in the industrial sectors of ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, coal, chemical, machine building, and power station industries. The industrial enterprises built in China with Soviet assistance are advanced and modern units in terms of their technical equipment and production technology, and have won high praise from our Chinese friends. These industrial enterprises have in fact become disseminators and schools in China's industry. With Soviet assistance, China has established and is developing various emerging industrial sectors, such as aluminum production, aviation, automobile and tractor manufacturing, electricity, heavy machinery manufacturing, instrument manufacturing, radio and some chemical industry sectors. We are pleased and proud of this. Experience shows that Chinese workers and experts working with Soviet experts are effectively mastering advanced methods of construction and production organization, and construction work is usually completed ahead of schedule.
    In order to assist in the construction and mastering of production of enterprises, as well as to help train China's own national cadres, the Soviet Union has sent about 7,000 experts. At the same time, about 8,000 Chinese experts and skilled workers have interned in Soviet enterprises and scientific and technological institutions. Close friendly relations and close business contacts have been established between Soviet experts working in China and Chinese employees, and between Chinese interns in the Soviet Union and Soviet workers and experts.
    In the various projects assisted by the Soviet Union in China, the proportion of design work completed and equipment provided by the Chinese side is rapidly increasing. This reflects the growth of China's own cadres, the improvement of the technical level of design institutions, and the development of its own machine-building industry. From 1953 to 1956, Chinese industry provided 20%-30% of the equipment for these enterprises, and in 1958 this increased to more than 45%-50%.
    The continuous upsurge of the economies of the Soviet Union and China has promoted the further expansion and strengthening of the economic ties between our two countries. This is illustrated by the fact that the complete sets of equipment provided by the Soviet Union to China this year will increase by about 80% compared with 1958. The Soviet Union and China successfully concluded negotiations, and on February 7, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Khrushchev and Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai signed new important agreements in Moscow. The Soviet Union will help China build and expand 78 industrial enterprises and power stations in metallurgy, chemical industry, coal, petroleum, machine building, radio technology, electrical machinery manufacturing, and building materials. Due to the significant achievements China has made in developing its national economy, especially in developing its machine-building industry and training its own skilled engineering and technical cadres, the Chinese side has been able to guarantee the production of the vast majority of complete sets of equipment for the enterprises stipulated in the agreement, as well as complete the design and surveying work for many of the aforementioned enterprises.
    The signing of this agreement is a new and important step in further consolidating and developing the fruitful and mutually beneficial economic cooperation and fraternal mutual assistance between the two socialist countries. The total value of the equipment design and various technical assistance provided by the Soviet Union as stipulated in the agreement is about 5 billion rubles. The Chinese side will supply the Soviet Union with commodities of significant economic importance to the Soviet Union in order to pay for the equipment and various technical assistance provided by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union will obtain from China the necessary quantities of materials that are very much needed by it, such as tungsten concentrate, molybdenum concentrate, tin, mercury, etc.
    In 1957, the volume of freight transported through border stations and seaports between the Soviet Union and China reached 6.7 million tons. It is estimated that the volume of foreign trade between the Soviet Union and China in 1958 increased by 13% compared with 1957, and in 1959 it will increase by more than 25% compared with last year.
    Scientific and technological cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is also developing smoothly, and extensive and multifaceted experience exchange work is being carried out, exchanging technical data and scientific research information on various issues of mutual concern. Joint research is also conducted on individual issues. In addition, experts are organized to visit in order to study the scientific and technological achievements and advanced experiences of the two countries. Since the signing of the "Sino-Soviet Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation" in October 1954, Soviet agencies have provided China free of charge with 1,100 sets of design data for industrial enterprises and other construction projects, 3,500 sets of drawings for manufacturing various machines and equipment, 950 sets of technical data, and 2,950 technical specifications on various topics. During the same period, approximately 1,000 Chinese experts studied scientific and technological achievements and advanced production experience in Soviet scientific institutions and enterprises. According to Chinese friends, they have developed comprehensive design drawings based on Soviet technical data, according to which 160 factories and other construction projects have been built. Chinese industry has mastered the production of more than 300 new products based on Soviet technical data. It is gratifying that the study of Soviet technical data has helped Chinese friends greatly shorten the time for design, construction, and mastering production, and reduce product costs, thereby promoting the rapid development of Chinese industry.
    On our part, the technical data, agricultural crop varieties, and other information provided to us by China are increasing year by year. Soviet agencies are applying the rich experience of Chinese hydrologists and regularly receive technical data on water conservancy construction, especially the experience of using groundwater to irrigate cotton. This experience has been widely applied in the Uzbek Republic. In addition, we have obtained rich materials reflecting China's centuries of valuable experience in building multi-arch dams and in traditional Chinese medicine, as well as valuable varieties of more than 1,500 kinds of crops and afforestation.
    Cooperation in science and technology also includes the training of scientific and production cadres. Chinese students, graduate students, and interns study or improve their skills in Soviet schools, factories, and institutions. From 1951 to 1958, 6,500 Chinese students graduated from Soviet universities. The doors of Chinese universities are also open to Soviet students. The forms and methods of scientific and technological cooperation are also being improved and developed. At present, in addition to the exchange of centralized technical data, direct links have also been established between 80 Chinese scientific research institutions and 144 Soviet scientific research institutions, which is also an aspect of scientific and technological cooperation. The Sino-Soviet protocol on the joint study of 122 scientific and technological issues signed on January 18, 1958, is of great significance for the further development of scientific and technological cooperation. Chinese and Soviet experts and scientists are working together to study the peaceful uses of atomic energy. The broad and multifaceted economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and China not only has a positive impact on the economic development and improvement of people's lives in both countries, but also, contrary to the attempts of imperialists and modern revisionists to undermine the internationalist unity of socialist countries, promotes the development and consolidation of the entire socialist camp.
    The people of the Soviet Union and China are marching side by side along the road of socialist and communist construction with full confidence. No force in the world can shake this great alliance. Today, the people of the Soviet Union and China, the people of socialist countries, and the working people of the world are shouting: For world peace and the victory of communism, let the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Soviet Union and China be further consolidated and prosper!

    两大兄弟人民的有益合作
    苏联部长会议对外经济联络委员会副主席    阿尔希波夫
    苏联与中华人民共和国人民怀着十分高兴的心情庆祝苏中友好同盟互助条约签订九周年。这个条约永世地巩固了苏中人民之间的兄弟友谊，奠定了两国之间政治经济和文化合作全面发展的牢固基础。
    我们伟大人民之间的友谊带来了卓越的成果，我们两国经济合作的顺利发展无可争辩地证明着这一点。正当社会主义与资本主义在物质生产方面的和平竞赛进入新的决定性阶段的时候，目前这个合作更具有特别重要的意义。正如赫鲁晓夫同志在苏共第二十一次代表大会上所作的报告中指出的，社会主义国家生产力的联合就为整个社会主义阵营和每一个社会主义国家提供了新的更多的可能来发展生产。
    苏中经济合作是多种多样的，它表现在对外贸易、帮助建设工业企业以及相互交换科学技术成就等方面。根据苏中各项协定，苏联在黑色和有色冶金、煤炭、化学、机器制造等工业部门以及电站工业企业方面，帮助中国建设二百一十一项巨大工程。中国在苏联帮助下建成的工业企业，就其技术装备和生产技术来说，都是先进的近代化单位，获得了中国朋友们的很高评价。这些工业企业事实上已成为在中国工业中的传布者和学校。在苏联帮助下，中国已建立并发展着各种新兴工业部门，如制铝、航空、汽车拖拉机制造、电力、重型机器制造、仪器制造、无线电和部分化学工业部门。我们为此感到高兴和自豪。经验表明，与苏联专家们一起工作的中国工人和专家们，正在有成效地掌握着建设和生产组织的先进方法，通常建设工作都是提前完成的。
    为了帮助企业的建设和掌握生产，以及帮助培养中国自己的民族干部，苏联曾派出了约七千名专家。同时约有八千名中国专家和熟练工人到苏联的企业和科学技术机关实习。在中国工作的苏联专家和中国职工间，在苏联的中国实习生和苏联工人专家间，都已建立了亲密的友谊关系和密切的业务联系。
    在苏联帮助中国建设的各个项目中，由中国方面完成设计工作和提供装备的比重正在迅速增长。这反映了中国本国干部的成长，设计机关技术水平的提高和本国机器制造业的发展。1953到1956年间，中国工业为这些企业提供了20％—30％的装备，而在1958年已增加到45％—50％以上。
    苏中两国经济的不断高涨，促进了进一步扩大和加强了我们两国的经济联系。今年苏联提供给中国的成套装备比1958年约增加80％就可说明这一点。苏联和中国顺利结束了谈判，2月7日苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来已在莫斯科签订了新的重要的协定。苏联将帮助中国建设和扩建冶金、化学、煤炭、石油、机器制造、无线电技术、电机制造、建筑材料等七十八个工业企业和电站。由于中国在发展国民经济特别是在发展机器制造业和培养自己熟练的工程技术干部方面所获得的重大成就，中国方面已能保证为协定中规定的企业生产绝大部分的成套设备，以及完成上述企业中许多企业的设计勘察工作。
    签定这项协定，是两个社会主义国家间富有成效的互利的经济合作和兄弟互助进一步巩固和发展的新的重要一步。协定中规定由苏联供应的设备设计和各种技术援助的总值共为五十亿卢布左右。中国方面将向苏联供应对苏联有重要经济意义的商品，以偿付苏联供应的设备和各种技术援助。苏联将从中国获得必需数量的对它非常需要的物资，如钨精矿、钼精矿、锡、水银等。
    1957年，苏中两国通过国境站和海港出入口的货运量达到六百七十万吨。据估计，1958年苏联与中国的对外贸易额比1957年增长了13％，而1959年将比去年增长25％以上。
    中苏两国之间的科学技术合作也在顺利地发展，并进行着广泛而多方面的经验交流工作，交换着彼此关心的各项问题的技术资料和科学研究工作情报。在个别问题上还共同进行研究。此外，为研究两国科学技术成就和先进经验，也组织专家访问。自从1954年10月签订了“中苏科学技术合作协定”以后，苏联机关无偿地交给了中国一千一百套工业企业及其他建设项目的设计资料，三千五百套制造各种机器设备的图纸，九百五十套技术资料和二千九百五十个专题的各种技术说明书。在同一期间，大约有一千位中国专家在苏联科学机关和企业研究了科学技术成就和先进生产经验。据中国朋友说，他们在苏联技术资料的基础上制定了综合设计图样，按照这些图样建成了一百六十座工厂和其他建设项目。中国工业按照苏联的技术资料掌握了三百多种新产品的生产。令人高兴的是，对苏联技术资料的研究，帮助了中国朋友大大缩减设计施工和掌握生产的时间，降低了产品成本，因而促进了中国工业快速度的发展。
    在我们这方面，中国给我们的技术资料、农业作物品种和其他一些资料正在逐年增多。苏联机关应用着中国水利学家的丰富经验，经常收到关于水利建设方面的技术资料，特别是利用地下水灌溉棉花的经验。这项经验已经在乌兹别克共和国广泛应用。此外，我们还得到了反映中国数世纪宝贵经验的建设多拱水坝和中医方面的丰富材料，还得到了一千五百多种农作物和植林方面的宝贵品种。
    科学技术方面的合作还包括对科学干部和生产干部的培养，中国留学生、研究生、实习生在苏联学校、工厂和机关中学习或提高技术。从1951到1958年，有六千五百名中国留学生在苏联高等学校毕业。中国高等学校的大门对苏联学生也是敞开的。科学技术合作的形式与方法也是日益完善和发展的。目前，除去交换集中的技术资料以外，在八十个中国科学研究机关和一百四十四个苏联科研机关之间还建立了直接联系，这也是科学技术合作的一个方面。对于科学技术合作的进一步发展，1958年1月18日签订的中苏两国关于共同研究一百二十二项科学技术问题的议定书有着巨大意义。中苏专家和科学家正在共同努力研究原子能的和平利用问题。苏中两国间的广泛多面的经济合作，不仅对两国的经济发展和人民生活的提高起了良好的影响，并且与帝国主义者和现代修正主义者企图破坏社会主义国家国际主义团结的愿望相反，促进了整个社会主义阵营的发展与巩固。
    苏中两国人民正信心百倍地沿着社会主义和共产主义建设的道路并肩前进。世界上没有任何力量能够动摇这一伟大的同盟，今天苏中两国人民、社会主义各国人民和全世界的劳动人民都在高呼：为了世界和平和共产主义的胜利，让牢不可破的中苏两国的兄弟友谊更加巩固和繁荣！
