After the Holiday, Launch a Successful First Shot, Striving for a Red Day Every Day in February
Workers in Beijing, Shanghai, and Other Places are in High Spirits and Throw Themselves into the New Battle

    (Our report) In the first working day after the Spring Festival, the vast number of employees on the industrial front in Beijing created outstanding achievements. On this day, the attendance rate in most factories throughout the city reached 100%, and many factories that had daily work plans overfulfilled their plans.
    On this day, many factory workers arrived early. The workers of the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory crowded into the workshop more than an hour before work; as soon as the whistle sounded, the machines started roaring together. News of production triumphs poured in from many factories. Workers in the rebar straightening group of the Fengtai Bridge Factory worked hard and skillfully, completing 150% of the daily plan. The whole factory overfulfilled the daily plan by 16%. The bulletin board of the Xinhua Printing Factory was covered with workers' pledges to ensure a "red start, red in the middle and late ten days of the month, and red for the whole month." On this day, all ten production workshops in the factory overfulfilled the daily work plan, achieving a "completely red" performance. The daily output value of the Beijing Wire Factory on this day increased by 21.9% compared with the average daily output value in early February.
    While striving to complete the day's plan, workers in many factories also began to arrange production for the last ten days of February to ensure the overfulfillment of the February production plan. The Beijing Chemical Plant immediately deployed a "battle plan" for the "second campaign" of February to all factory employees after starting work. The employees of this factory stated that they would strive to complete 60% of the monthly plan by February 17.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 12) Immediately after the Spring Festival, workers in Shanghai factories threw themselves into intensive labor with great enthusiasm.
    Most of the factories in Shanghai that had a Spring Festival holiday had resumed production by the 12th, and the employee attendance rate was generally higher than usual. In many workshops, except for a few workers on sick leave, attendance was 100%.
    On the first working day after the holiday, news of production triumphs frequently came from various factories. Workers in the mechanized steel wire rope section of the metal products workshop of the Shanghai No. 2 Iron and Steel Plant accelerated their machine speed after returning to work and continuously created the highest plant records of 2,302 meters and 2,832 meters of steel wire rope in one shift. Zhu Huilin, a driller in the oil pump workshop of the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, completed 26 hours and 17 minutes of work in eight hours. Wang Jifu, an old worker at the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, tripled production efficiency and did sixteen hours of work in four hours.
    All forty-eight cotton textile factories in the city have resumed production. Many factories immediately reached normal production levels in terms of output and quality as soon as they started work, changing the unstable production phenomenon that occurred in previous years due to starting cold machines. On the first day after the holiday, the North Spinning Workshop of the No. 1 State Cotton Mill was filled with twice as many workers as usual. It turned out that workers from Classes B and C had come to support the workers from Class A to help the early shift overcome the difficulties of many yarn breakages when starting cold machines. They did not leave until the machines were running normally. The light industry factories were also full of vigorous atmosphere. The Tianzhang Paper Mill started work on the 10th, and the daily output on the 11th increased by about 9% compared with the average daily output before the Spring Festival.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 12) On the first day of work after the Spring Festival, many factories in Tianjin achieved 100% attendance rates, and news of production triumphs continued to come. According to statistics, of the 166 factories that started work in the Hongqiao District on the 12th, all the workers in 124 factories attended work; 90 factories completed or overfulfilled the daily production plan. Most of the 41 factories that started work in the Hedong District overfulfilled the daily production plan.
    As soon as they started work after the holiday, the employees of many factories held oath-taking rallies and put forward the slogans of "red start, red every day, and completely red," setting off a competition upsurge of "striving to go upstream and creating miracles." After the production teams of the No. 8 Plumbing Factory launched a competition to compare with and catch up with the advanced, the lathe group rotated the 8-foot full gear lathe shaft, increasing from an average daily output of 8 tons in early February to 13 tons. On the first day of work after the holiday, all employees of the Xinghua Paper Mill attended work. Labor model Chen Liji increased the speed of the No. 25 paper machine, increasing the paper output from 160 kilograms per hour to 180 kilograms; the daily output plan for the whole factory was more than 8,700 kilograms, and the actual completion was more than 9,000 kilograms, and the quality also completed the plan.
    In the competition, the employees of many factories carried out technical innovation and tackled key technical problems. In the past, the No. 2 Vehicle Tool Factory manufactured eccentric shafts for bicycle expanding brakes by manual fitting, with a daily output of only 200 pieces. Veteran worker Yang Chunhai and others worked hard for a day during the Spring Festival holiday and created a fitting machine to replace manual operation, which enabled the daily output to reach 8,000 pieces on the first day of work after the holiday. On the 12th, the employees of the Tianjin Pharmaceutical Factory put forward 191 innovation suggestions, and the daily output plan was overfulfilled by 55%.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 12) After happily spending the Spring Festival, Guangzhou workers immediately threw themselves into the new production battle with full enthusiasm.
    The Spring Festival holiday ended on the 11th, and factories in Guangzhou immediately started production. After more than 430 factories in the Zhong District started work on the 11th, the workers launched a production competition. More than 260 light industry factories in the district generally completed the daily production plan on the 11th, and the total output value increased by more than 40% compared with the same day last month. After the workers of the Guanghe Xing Factory launched a competition, the production efficiency immediately increased. The production level reached by only 34 workers before the Spring Festival has now been reached by 65 workers. Workers in the steelmaking, rolling, and pressing workshops of the Jiehe Steel Plant in the Nan District returned to the plant in advance during the Spring Festival to repair the machinery and equipment, so that production could proceed smoothly as soon as they started work after the holiday.

    节后打响头一炮　力争二月日日红
    北京上海等地广大工人精神抖擞投入新战斗
    本报讯　在春节后的第一个工作日里，北京市工业战线上的广大职工创造了出色的成绩。这一天，全市大多数工厂的出勤率都达到百分之百，许多编制了日作业计划的工厂都超额完成了计划。
    这一天，许多工厂的职工都提前来到工厂。北京第一棉纺织厂的工人们离上班还有一个多钟头，就一群群地拥进车间；上班笛声的余音未尽，机器就一齐轰响了起来。生产捷报由许多工厂纷纷传出。丰台桥梁厂钢筋调直组的工人猛干巧干，完成日计划150％。全厂超额16％完成了日计划。新华印刷厂的板牌上贴满了工人们保证“开门红，中下旬日日红和全月红”的决心书。这一天全厂十个生产车间全部超额完成了日作业计划，作到了“满堂红”。北京电线厂这一天的日产值，比2月上旬平均日产值提高了21.9％。
    许多工厂的职工一方面奋勇完成当天的计划，一方面着手安排2月下旬生产，保证超额完成2月份生产计划。北京市化工厂在开工后立即向全厂职工部署了2月份“第二个战役”的“作战计划”。这个厂的职工表示要争取在2月17日前完成全月计划的60％。
    据新华社上海12日电　春节刚过，上海各工厂的工人就精神饱满地投入紧张的劳动。
    上海市春节休假的工厂，到12日绝大部分已开工生产，职工出勤率大都比平时为高，许多车间除了少数工人请病假以外，都是百分之百出勤。
    在节后的第一个劳动日里，各厂生产捷报频频传出。上海第二钢铁厂金属制品车间机制钢丝绳工段工人，节后上班便加快车速，连续创造了班产钢丝绳二千三百零二公尺、二千八百三十二公尺的全厂最高纪录。上海柴油机厂油泵车间钻工朱慧麟，在八小时内完成了二十六小时零十七分钟的工作量。上海机床厂老工人王继富，提高生产效率三倍，四小时做了十六个小时的活。
    全市四十八家棉纺织厂已经全部开工。很多工厂一开工，产量和质量立刻达到正常生产水平，改变了往年因为开冷车而出现的生产不稳定的现象。国棉一厂北纺车间节后的第一天挤满了比往常多两倍的工人，原来是乙、丙两班的工人特地赶来支援甲班工人，帮助早班克服开冷车断头多的困难，一直到车子运转正常后才离开。各轻工业工厂也充满着蓬蓬勃勃的气象。天章造纸厂10日开工，11日的日产量就比春节前的平均日产量提高9％左右。

    许多工厂的职工节后一上班，就举行了誓师大会，提出“开门红、日日红、满堂红”的口号，掀起“争上游、创奇迹”的竞赛热潮。第八水暖厂各生产小组之间开展比先进、赶先进的竞赛后，车工一组旋八尺全齿轮车床轴，由上旬平均日产八吨提高到十三吨。兴华造纸厂节后开工第一天，职工们全部出勤，劳动模范陈立基提高二十五号造纸机的转速，使纸的产量由每小时一百六十公斤提到一百八十公斤；全厂日产量计划是八千七百多公斤，实际完成了九千多公斤，质量也完成了计划。
    许多工厂的职工，在竞赛中大搞技术革新，猛攻技术关键。第二车具厂过去制造自行车胀闸偏心轴，是由人工套扣，日产量只二百个；老工人杨春海等在春节假期苦战一天，创造出套扣机，代替手工操作，在节后上班的第一天就使日产量达到八千个。天津制药厂职工12日上班提出了革新建议一百九十一件，日产量计划超额55％完成。
    新华社广州12日电　广州市工人欢乐地度过春节后，立即干劲十足地投入新的生产战斗。
    11日春节假期结束，广州市各工厂立即开工生产。中区四百三十多家工厂11日开工后，工人们就展开生产竞赛。全区二百六十多家轻工业工厂，11日普遍完成了日生产计划，总产值比上月同一天增长40％以上。广和兴厂的工人开展竞赛以后，生产效率立即提高，春节前只有三十四个工人达到的生产水平，现在有六十五个工人达到了。南区捷和钢铁厂的炼钢、轧钢、压片等车间工人，在春节期间就提前回厂把机器设备检修好，使节后一开工，生产就顺利地进行。
