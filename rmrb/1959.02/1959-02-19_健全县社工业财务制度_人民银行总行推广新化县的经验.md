Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, February 18th: The People's Bank of China General Office recently held an on-site meeting in Xinhua County, Hunan Province, to exchange and promote Xinhua County's experience in assisting county and commune industrial enterprises in establishing financial systems and improving financial management.

Last year, the number of county-run and commune-run factories and mines in Xinhua County increased from nine to forty-seven. Faced with rapid industrial development, a wide distribution of factories and mines, and a shortage of financial accounting personnel, Xinhua County adopted a series of measures based on consistently implementing ideological education, including "grasping, unifying, clearing, allocating, establishing, and comparing," to improve financial management and adapt to and promote production development. "Grasping" means that two members of the county party committee are specifically responsible for managing economic work, grasping the financial revenue and expenditure and asset management of factories and mines. "Unifying" means combining the work of the finance, banking, and industrial departments into a single force, managed and arranged uniformly by the county party committee, with unified contracting to complete tasks. Financial accounting personnel from finance and banking departments were organized to establish a financial work guidance network throughout the county. This enables cadres in each department to manage both their own department's business and production expenditures, organically combining departmental business with production. "Clearing" means mobilizing the masses to carry out a major financial review in conjunction with production. "Allocating" means uniformly allocating and training financial accounting cadres. Since the large-scale development of industry last year, the county has trained 600 financial accounting personnel. "Establishing" means comprehensively establishing accounts and systems, promoting planned management, and fully implementing "five fixings" (fixed personnel, fixed time, fixed quality, fixed quantity, fixed materials), "three hangings" (publicizing the situation of output, raw materials, and technological innovation), and "two participations and one reform" to overcome the shortcomings of incomplete systems and chaotic accounts. "Comparing" means conducting monthly and quarterly evaluations of financial management work, inserting red flags, establishing "pace-setters," encouraging advanced units, and driving the backward. Through this series of tasks, the expenditures of factories and mines in Xinhua County have been greatly reduced, costs have been greatly lowered, and capital turnover has been greatly accelerated. Steel enterprises alone turned over more than 100,000 yuan in profits last year.

Representatives attending the meeting believed that the current financial management work of county and commune industries in various regions cannot meet the needs of continuous production development. It is necessary to learn from and refer to the experience of Xinhua County. Under the leadership of the local party committees, in conjunction with the current central tasks, and in coordination with the financial departments and local industrial authorities, we should actively and proactively help county and commune industrial enterprises rectify financial work, establish and improve necessary financial management systems, and promote the use of enterprise working capital to better meet the requirements of the party and state policies and better adapt to the needs of industrial production development. Banking departments should regularly concern themselves with and be familiar with every aspect of industrial enterprises' financial management and even production and operation management, as well as various related issues in the use of working capital, and under the leadership of the Party, pay attention to relying on the masses to resolve them in a timely and reasonable manner, so that the use of enterprise working capital is more rational.

    健全县社工业财务制度
    人民银行总行推广新化县的经验
    新华社长沙18日电　中国人民银行总行，最近在湖南省新化县召开现场会议，交流和推广新化县协助县、社工业企业建立财务制度、改善财务管理的经验。
    新化县县办的和公社办的厂矿，去年由九个发展到四十七个。在工业发展快、布局广、而财务会计人员又少的情况下，新化县在自始至终贯彻思想教育的基础上，采取“抓、统、清、配、建、评比”等一系列措施，健全财务管理，适应并促进了生产的发展。“抓”就是由两个县委委员具体负责管理经济工作，抓厂矿财务收支和资产管理工作。“统”就是把财政、银行、工业部门的工作拧成一股绳，由县委统一管理，统一布置，统一包干完成任务。组织财政、银行等部门的财务会计人员，在全县建立财会工作辅导网。这样使各部门干部既管本部门业务，又管生产开支，把部门业务和生产有机地结合起来。“清”就是发动群众，结合生产，开展财务大清理。“配”就是统一调配和训练财务会计干部。全县自去年大办工业以来，已训练出财务会计人员六百人。“建”就是全面建账建制，推行计划管理，全面实行“五定”（定人、定时、定质、定量、定料）、“三挂牌”（即公布产量、原材料、技术革新的情况）和“两参一改”，克服制度不全、账目混乱的缺点。“评比”就是按月按季进行财务管理工作评比，插红旗，树“标兵”，鼓励先进，带动落后。通过这一系列的工作，新化县各厂矿的开支大大减少，成本大大降低，资金周转大大加速。单是钢铁企业去年就上缴利润十万多元。
    出席会议的代表认为，目前各地县、社工业财务管理工作还不能适应生产不断发展的需要，有必要学习和参照新化县的经验，在各地党委的领导下，结合当前的中心任务，配合财政部门和地方工业主管部门，积极主动地帮助县、社工业企业整顿财务工作，建立和健全必要的财务管理制度，促使企业流动资金的运用，更加符合党和国家政策的要求，更好地适应工业生产发展的需要。银行部门应该经常关心和熟悉工业企业财务管理以至生产经营管理中的每一个环节，以及流动资金占用上所发生的各种有关问题，并在党的领导下，注意依靠群众，及时合理地予以解决，使企业流动资金运用的更加合理。
