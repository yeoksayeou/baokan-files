    Inheritance and Originality
    Xiao Pi'an
    Inheritance and originality: this is the dialectic in cultural and artistic work, the unity of opposites.
    Those who only look backwards only acknowledge inheritance, and do not acknowledge or dare to create. They are bound hand and foot by the ancients, and their eyes are covered by the ancients. And this so-called inheritance becomes nothing more than sticking to conventions and swallowing everything whole. As a result, some things in the cultural heritage that were originally very good and useful have become ossified antiques. This is what we must oppose. But if we go to the other extreme, thinking that the development of culture and art can be separated from the development of history, that it can be separated from the inheritance and learning from excellent cultural heritage, and that everything can be started anew, that is also wrong and harmful.
    Chairman Mao once told us: "We must inherit all the excellent literary and artistic heritage, critically absorb all the beneficial things in it, and use them as a reference when creating works from the literary and artistic materials of the people's lives here and now." "But inheritance and learning can never become a substitute for one's own creation, which can never be replaced." I believe that this is the most profound and insightful explanation of how to correctly treat cultural heritage, and the relationship between inheritance and creation in culture and art, and the most basic principle of combining inheritance and creation.

    继承和独创
    萧丕安
    继承和独创，这是文化艺术工作中的辩证法，是对立的统一。
    两眼向后的人，他们只承认继承，不承认也不敢创造。他们被古人捆住了手脚，被古人蒙上了眼睛。而这种所谓继承，也就变成了墨守成规，食古不化。结果，文化遗产中一些本来是很好很有用的东西，也就变成了僵死的古董。这是我们要反对的。但倘若走上另外一个极端，认为文化艺术的发展可以离开历史的发展，可以离开对优秀的文化遗产的继承和借鉴，一切都是重新做起，那也是不对的和有害的。
    毛主席曾告诉我们说：“我们必须继承一切优秀的文学艺术遗产，批判地吸收其中一切有益的东西，作为我们从此时此地的人民生活中的文学艺术原料创造作品时候的借鉴。”“但是继承和借鉴决不可以变成替代自己的创造，这是决不能替代的。”我以为，这就是对如何正确地对待文化遗产，对文化艺术的继承与创造的关系，最深刻、最精辟的解释，是继承和创造相结合的最基本的原则。
