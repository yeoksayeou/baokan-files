    Xinhua News Agency, London, February 10th: According to TASS, London, February 9th, "The Times" published an open letter on February 9th, signed by a group of Labour MPs, demanding that Macmillan announce certain revisions to British foreign policy before going to Moscow.

    These Labour MPs welcomed Macmillan's upcoming visit to Moscow "if serious attention is paid to promoting mutual understanding and world peace."

    The letter stated that a test of sincerity would be whether the Prime Minister is willing to change his previous stubborn positions on all major contentious issues concerning Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, and disarmament.

    The letter pointed out that the British government "should declare its sincerity in adopting a new attitude, resolving the German question and European security issues based on the principle of creating a reasonable prospect for reaching an agreement, thereby clarifying all doubts. The government should be prepared to abandon demands for German reunification through free elections and the right of a unified Germany to join NATO; the government should agree to establish some kind of buffer zone based on the Rapacki Plan...."

    The letter considered that "the proposals in the recent Soviet note all indicate that an agreement can be reached on this basis with the Soviet Union."

    The letter was signed by Mikardo, Silverman, Swingler, Zilliacus, and Davies, among others.

    要求英政府修改外交政策
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社伦敦9日讯：“泰晤士报”2月9日发表了一批工党议员签署的公开信，要求麦克米伦赴莫斯科前宣布对英国外交政策作某些修改。
    这批工党议员欢迎麦克米伦即将去莫斯科的访问，“如果认真注意到促进相互谅解和世界和平的话”。
    信中说，首相有否诚意改变他以前对欧洲、中东和远东以及裁军方面所有重要争执问题上的固执立场，将是这方面的考验。
    信中指出，英国政府“应当声明有诚意采取新的态度，本着为达成协议创造合理前途的原则，来解决德国问题和欧洲安全问题，从而澄清一切疑虑。政府应当准备放弃这样的要求：通过自由选举恢复德国统一和统一后的德国有权加入北大西洋公约组织；政府应当同意本着腊帕茨基计划建立某种缓冲地带……。”
    信中认为“苏联最近照会中的建议，都表明在苏联这个基础上可以达成协议”。
    在信上签名的有：米卡多、锡尔弗曼、斯文特勒、齐里亚库斯和戴维斯等人。
