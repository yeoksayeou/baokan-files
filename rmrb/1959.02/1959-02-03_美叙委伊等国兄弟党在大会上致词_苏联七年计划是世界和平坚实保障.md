Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 2nd: At the morning session of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on February 2nd, representatives from the Communist Party of the United States, the Syrian Communist Party, the Venezuelan Communist Party, and the Iraqi Communist Party delivered congratulatory speeches to the congress. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by the attendees.

    James Jackson, Secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, said in his speech at the congress that the completion of the Soviet Seven-Year Plan would elevate the Soviet Union to a height unattainable by the capitalist world, leading the Soviet Union towards communism.

    Jackson quoted Khrushchev's statement that the Soviet Union would do everything possible to guarantee world peace and said that the Communist Party of the United States had received tremendous encouragement and moral support from this call. We, the American Communists, will not allow the imperialist merchants of death to push the United States into a war that can only lead to the annihilation of our nation.

    Jackson continued: I know that fraternal communist parties are very concerned about the activities of the Communist Party of the United States. I can say with certainty that it lives among the masses and participates in the constant struggles of the masses to improve the living conditions of the working people and to fight for peace. The Communist Party of the United States has eliminated the revisionist sores in its leadership, is full of determination to fight against sectarianism and dogmatism, and firmly stands on the position of Marxism-Leninism.

    Jackson also spoke about the persecution of the Communist Party of the United States by the U.S. government. He said that if President Eisenhower could also say, as Khrushchev said in his report, that there were no people imprisoned in the United States for political reasons, then many activists of the American communist movement and the workers' movement would be able to attend this congress and offer their congratulations to the delegates present. Jackson then listed the names of many communists being tortured in American prisons.

    Jackson also read out the congratulatory letter from the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States to the 21st Congress of the CPSU.

    Khaled Bagdash, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Syrian Communist Party, said in his congratulatory message that the great achievements the Soviet Union would achieve in the next seven years would be a victory for all mankind, a victory for democracy and peace. The people of the Arab East are proud of the achievements of their loyal friend, the Soviet Union.

    Bagdash said that the people of the Syrian region of the United Arab Republic have known about the Communist Party for more than thirty years. It is difficult to make them believe that the Communist Party is an enemy of national unity.

    Bagdash went on to emphasize that without the support of the socialist camp, the struggle of the Arab people would not have succeeded, the Arab countries would not have achieved victory, and they could not have developed their economies.

    Bagdash said that Arab unity is primarily for the struggle to get rid of imperialist oppression.

    Bagdash finally congratulated the Soviet people and their struggle to build communism, and the friendship between the Soviet Union and the Arab world.

    Pompeyo Márquez, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Venezuela, congratulated the congress, saying, "We are grateful for the support you give to our party and other communist parties around the world. Your support is your achievement in developing the national economy, science and technology. Your Earth satellites and space rockets show the Venezuelan people the growing power of their friends, the socialist builders, and the weakening of their enemies, the American monopoly capitalists.

    Pompeyo Márquez described how the Venezuelan people, who had overthrown the Jiménez regime, had prevented three military coup plots directed by U.S. monopolies and stopped the threat of a U.S. Marine invasion.

    He said that our main aim is to have a government of national unity in the country that serves the interests of the people, that pursues a policy of protecting the freedoms already won, and that is free from the control of the U.S. State Department in its foreign policy.

    Pompeyo Márquez said that the completion of the Soviet people's Seven-Year Plan would inspire the Communist Party of Venezuela in its work.

    Salam Adil, representative of the Iraqi Communist Party, said in his speech that the broad masses of the Iraqi people have long recognized the significance of the Soviet Union's achievements in strengthening their national independence and progress. Salam Adil pointed out that Iraq used to be a base for imperialist aggressors. An aggressive pact was even named after Baghdad. However, as soon as the Iraqi revolution triumphed, the Iraqi government immediately established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries in the socialist camp. The independent state of Iraq has benefited from this friendship since its inception. Salam Adil continued, the landing of imperialist troops in Jordan and Lebanon threatened the Republic of Iraq. However, thanks to the assistance of the countries of the socialist camp, the Iraqi people defended their independence. He stressed that the people of our country are loyal to their friends who have supported them in difficult times. Salam Adil said that any opposition to the communist movement in any Arab country would weaken the national movement of that country and other Arab countries and would damage Arab unity. He went on to say that the 21st Congress of the CPSU will help the broad masses of people all over the world to compare dying capitalism with constantly victorious socialism. He stressed that the Soviet Seven-Year Plan is a solid guarantee of world peace. At the morning session, the chairman announced that the congress had received a congratulatory telegram from the Italian Socialist Party.

    美叙委伊等国兄弟党在大会上致词
    苏联七年计划是世界和平坚实保障
    新华社莫斯科2日电　在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会2日上午会议上，美国共产党、叙利亚共产党、委内瑞拉共产党和伊拉克共产党代表向大会致了贺词。他们的讲话受到了与会者的热烈欢迎。
    美国共产党全国委员会书记詹姆斯·杰克逊在代表大会上讲话说，苏联七年计划的完成将把苏联提高到资本主义世界所达不到的高度，把苏联引向共产主义。
    杰克逊引用了赫鲁晓夫的关于苏联将尽一切可能来保障世界和平的一段话之后说，美国共产党在这个号召中得到了巨大的鼓舞和道义上的支持。我们美国共产党人不允许帝国主义死亡贩子把美国推入只会导致我们民族复灭的战争。
    杰克逊接着说：我知道，兄弟共产党对美国共产党的活动感到很大的关心。我可以肯定地说，它生活在群众当中，它参加群众的争取改善劳动人民境况和争取和平的经常斗争。美国共产党消除了领导中的修正主义溃伤，充满同宗派主义者和教条主义者斗争的决心，坚定地站在马克思列宁主义的立场上。
    杰克逊还谈到美国政府对美国共产党的迫害。他说，如果艾森豪威尔总统也能像赫鲁晓夫在报告中说的那样，说在美国也没有由于政治原因而被关在监狱里的人，那么美国共产主义运动和工人运动的许多活动家也就能够参加这次代表大会和向到会的代表表示祝贺了。杰克逊接着列举了在美国监狱中受折磨的许多共产党员的名字。
    杰克逊还宣读了美国共产党全国委员会给苏共第二十一次代表大会的贺信。
    叙利亚共产党中央委员会总书记哈立德·巴格达什在贺词中说，苏联在今后七年内取得的伟大成就将是全人类的胜利，是民主和和平的胜利。阿拉伯东方各国人民为自己忠实的朋友——苏联的成就感到骄傲。
    巴格达什说，阿拉伯联合共和国叙利亚地区的人民知道共产党已经有三十多年了。硬要使他们相信共产党是民族团结的敌人，这是困难的。
    巴格达什接着强调说，如果不是社会主义阵营的支持，阿拉伯人民的斗争就不会成功，阿拉伯各国就不会取得胜利，也不能发展自己的经济。
    巴格达什说，阿拉伯的团结首先是为了摆脱帝国主义压迫的斗争。
    巴格达什最后对苏联人民和他们的建设共产主义的斗争，对苏联同阿拉伯的友谊表示祝贺。
    委内瑞拉共产党中央政治局委员庞佩约·马尔克斯向代表大会致贺词说，我们对你们给予我们党和全世界其他共产党的支持表示感激。你们的支持就是你们在发展国民经济、科学和技术方面的成就。你们的地球卫星和宇宙火箭向委内瑞拉人民说明他们的朋友——社会主义建设者的日益增长的威力，说明他们的敌人——美国垄断资本家的削弱。
    庞佩约·马尔克斯叙述了已经推翻希门尼斯政权的委内瑞拉人民怎样防止了美国垄断组织所指使的三次军事政变的阴谋，怎样制止了美国海军陆战队侵犯的威胁。
    他说，我们的主要目的在于使国内有一个符合人民利益的民族统一政府，它要实行保护已经争取到的自由的政策，并在外交政策上摆脱美国国务院的控制。
    庞佩约·马尔克斯说，苏联人民七年计划的完成将使委内瑞拉共产党在工作中得到鼓舞。
    伊拉克共产党代表萨拉姆·阿迪勒致词说，伊拉克的广大人民群众早就认识到苏联的成就对于加强他们的民族独立和进步的意义。萨拉姆·阿迪勒指出，伊拉克过去曾经是帝国主义侵略者的基地。有一个侵略性的公约就是以巴格达命名的。但是，伊拉克革命一胜利，伊拉克政府就马上同苏联、中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营的其他国家建立了外交关系。独立的伊拉克国家从它一成立的时候起，就得到这种友谊的好处。萨拉姆·阿迪勒接着说，帝国主义军队在约旦和黎巴嫩的登陆威胁了伊拉克共和国。但是，由于社会主义阵营各国的援助，伊拉克人民捍卫住了自己的独立。他强调说，我国人民忠实于曾经在困难时刻支持过他们的朋友。萨拉姆·阿迪勒说，对任何一个阿拉伯国家的共产主义运动的任何反对，都会削弱这个国家和其他阿拉伯国家的民族运动，并给阿拉伯人的团结带来损失。他接着说，苏共第二十一次代表大会将帮助全世界广大人民群众把垂死的资本主义同不断胜利的社会主义进行比较。他强调说，苏联的七年计划是世界和平的坚实的保障。在上午会议上，主席宣布，代表大会收到了意大利社会党发来的贺电。
