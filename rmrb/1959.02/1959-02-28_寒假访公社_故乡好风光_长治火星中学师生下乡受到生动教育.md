Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, February 27th: The Party and Communist Youth League branches of Changzhi Huoxing Middle School organized students to hold discussions summarizing the gains from their visits to the People's Communes during the winter vacation, providing a lively socialist and communist education for all teachers and students.

Before the Spring Festival, the Party branch of Huoxing Middle School called on all students to visit the People's Communes during their winter vacation. During the vacation, many students visited the production and life of the People's Communes. After the start of the school term, the Party branch organized various forms of discussions in classes and groups, allowing students to freely talk about their vacation gains.

At the discussion meetings, many students enthusiastically expressed their feelings. Student Han Peizhen said: "I went back at the beginning of February, and the commune was busy arranging for the Spring Festival. According to the principle of 'large collective, small freedom,' some commune members were willing to go home to eat the New Year's dinner themselves. The commune then supplied them with the grain and non-staple food needed for the Spring Festival." Han Peizhen excitedly said: "Our village has been installed with electric lights and loudspeakers. At night, the lights are bright, and the loudspeakers play music. On the first day of the lunar new year, the Party branch secretary, the commune director, and the students lined up to visit the elderly in the House of Respect for the Aged, and sent them snacks and other gifts. Grandma Wang in the House of Respect for the Aged excitedly said: 'Last year during the New Year, only one son-in-law brought a few things. This year, cadres and the masses all come to send gifts, it's really good!'" Female student Hou Xiangguo said: "Our Victory People's Commune is different from them. During the Spring Festival, commune members eat together, and students returning home also eat with the commune members. Families gather together in the dining hall, which is very lively. The commune members were extremely happy, and we even took a picture to send to Chairman Mao." Student Zhang Shengfang said: "In our village, many people consciously went to accumulate fertilizer as early as the second day of the lunar new year. The farmers' enthusiasm is truly great."

Many students also talked about the new look of the countryside, such as the leap forward colored archways, cement factories, power plants, large reservoirs, etc. There are so many new constructions that students felt like they had arrived at a new place when they returned to their hometown. The students were all proud of this prosperous scene of the country. Zhang Yingruo from Class One wrote such a poem: "Leaving school for winter vacation, returning to hometown, the scenery is ever-changing, so beautiful; South of the village, there used to be a mound of earth, where no crops could be planted, and weeds grew wild. After the People's Commune appeared, this place has changed greatly. Tall chimneys soar into the sky, and new workshops are built everywhere; Large-scale water conservancy projects build reservoirs, and canals form a network with many ponds."

Now, the students have written many big-character posters to the Party organization, wanting to learn from the commune members' soaring enthusiasm, and to achieve a greater leap forward in learning and productive labor in 1959.

    寒假访公社　故乡好风光
    长治火星中学师生下乡受到生动教育
    新华社太原27日电　长治火星中学党团支部组织学生座谈总结假期访问人民公社的收获，对全体师生进行了一次生动活泼的社会主义和共产主义教育。
    春节以前，火星中学党支部曾号召全体学生在放寒假时访问人民公社。假期中，许多学生对人民公社的生产和生活进行了访问。开学后，党支部分班、分小组地组织各种形式的座谈会，由学生畅谈假期收获。
    座谈会上许多学生热烈地发表了自己的感想。学生韩培珍说：我2月初回去，公社正在忙着安排过春节。根据大集体小自由的原则，有一部分社员愿意自己回家吃年饭。公社就供给他们过春节需要的粮食和副食品。韩培珍兴奋地说：我们村里已安上了电灯、广播喇叭、晚上电灯明亮亮，大小喇叭齐放音乐。初一那天，党支书、社长和学生们排着队到敬老院去向老人们拜年，并送去点心等礼物。敬老院的王奶奶兴奋地说：“去年过年时，只有一个女婿拿一点东西来，今年干部、群众都来送礼物，真是好啊！”女学生侯先果说：我们胜利人民公社和他们不一样，春节期间社员是大家在一块吃饭，回乡的学生也和社员一起吃，在大饭厅里各家团集一起，非常热闹。社员高兴极了，我们还照了像给毛主席寄去了。学生张生芳说：我们村里在旧历初二就有许多人自觉地去积肥，农民的干劲真是大极了。
    许多学生还谈到了农村的新面貌，什么跃进彩门、水泥厂、发电厂、大水库等，新建设多极了，学生回到家乡去简直像到了一个新地方。学生们都为国家这种欣欣向荣的景象感到自豪。一班张颖若写出了这样一首诗：寒假离校回故乡，千变万化好风光，村南从前是土丘，不能种田长荒草，人民公社出现后，这里大大变了样，高大烟囱耸九霄，遍地盖起新工房；大兴水利修水库，渠道成网多池塘。
    现在，学生们向党组织写了不少大字报，要学习公社社员的冲天干劲，1959年在学习和生产劳动中，来一个更大的跃进。
