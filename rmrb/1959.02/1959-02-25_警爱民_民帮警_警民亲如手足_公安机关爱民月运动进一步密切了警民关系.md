Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: Public security organs and police officers across the country universally launched "Love-the-People Month" campaigns around the Spring Festival. Through this movement, the connection between public security personnel and the people has been further strengthened, and the people are more actively assisting public security personnel in maintaining public order.

The launch of the "Love-the-People" campaign among public security personnel was decided at the Ninth National Public Security Conference in July 1958. According to the resolution of that conference, a nationwide "Love-the-People" campaign will be launched among public security personnel annually at the end of the year or during the Spring Festival to better promote and enhance the fine traditions and work styles on China's public security front.

The broad masses of the people have praised the excellent work style of the people's police with extremely high regard. They say that only under the socialist system can the police and the people truly become one. Therefore, they are more willing to approach and help the people's police, and this close relationship, like brothers and sisters, greatly enhances the power of dictatorship over the enemy.

During the "Love-the-People Month" campaign, public security cadres and people's police officers in various places first conscientiously studied the "Eight Disciplines and Ten Points of Attention for People's Police" and held heated discussions. Through their self-education, the broad masses of cadres and police officers further clarified how to correctly distinguish between contradictions between the enemy and ourselves and contradictions among the people in their actual work, and they resolved to firmly establish the idea of being ruthless to the enemy, harmonious internally, and wholeheartedly serving the people, so that every public security officer consciously becomes a glorious and obedient tool of dictatorship in the hands of the Party and the people. While carrying out self-education, public security personnel in various places also extensively launched vigorous publicity activities, solicited opinions from the masses in various ways, and launched a wave of doing good deeds for the masses. According to statistics from 44 cities and counties including Guangzhou and Puning in Guangdong Province, people's police officers did more than 152,000 various good deeds for the masses during "Love-the-People Month." Many people's police officers in Guangzhou combined fire prevention inspections with repairing stoves for residents. People's police officers in the Central District alone assisted more than 800 households in repairing stoves. People's police officers in the Central and Northern Districts also helped the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and households lacking labor with many household chores, such as chopping firewood, carrying water, washing clothes, and sweeping the floor. A police squad in Liaocheng Prefecture, Shandong Province, did more than 300 good deeds for the masses in five days from January 5th to 10th. They dug a total of 43,000 catties of manure, transported 295,000 catties of fertilizer, harvested more than 44,000 catties of grain, and helped residents catch a large number of rats and sparrows. During "Love-the-People Month," people's police officers at the Tianjia'an Police Station of the Huaihe River Water Public Security Bureau in Anhui Province helped more than 30 boat people from other places and sick travelers to go to the hospital for treatment. Combining household registration on boats or going out to work with boats, they lived, ate, and worked with the boat people, and helped the boat people deal with more than 120 family disputes and marriages.

Many people's police officers have further improved their work style through these activities. In the past, a few traffic police officers in Harbin often argued with the masses when handling traffic violations due to simple methods and harsh attitudes. Now, they generally "speak politely first, treat people with courtesy," and have made 250 friends. The Nangang Traffic Police Squad in the city also set up a "Convenience Service Office" at the railway station, which has helped passengers find agencies and residences more than 10,000 times in a month, and people have praised its convenience.

These "Love-the-People" activities have further strengthened the relationship between the police and the people, and new scenes of police loving the people, the people helping the police, and working together to maintain public order have emerged everywhere. Li Yongtao, an 87-year-old man from Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, wrote a poem praising "Love-the-People Month," saying: "This month is called 'Love-the-People,' loving the people is not just for this month; long-term service for the people, eliminate the bad and protect the good." Because the people have been educated by the "Love-the-People" movement, they have further realized that everyone is responsible for defending the construction of the motherland and maintaining social order. They actively report bad people and bad deeds. The masses in Taishan County, Guangdong Province, recently helped the public security organs to ferret out the remaining counter-revolutionaries who had escaped. When the people's police officers in Duyun City, Guizhou Province, go to the streets now, they can hear enthusiastic greetings everywhere, and the masses can actively reflect any situation they want to know. Not long ago, a prisoner escaped from the Gaoqiao duty station of the People's Police Brigade in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province. During the police pursuit, a woman immediately ran out to help catch the prisoner. The prisoner threw the woman to the ground, breaking her head, but she got up and chased after him until she caught the prisoner. Because the police and the people are closely integrated, the power of dictatorship has been strengthened, making it impossible for some hidden counter-revolutionaries and bad elements to hide. Lun Zhiyuan, a habitual thief who had been committing crimes in various parts of Guangdong for four years, surrendered to the Jiangmen City Public Security Bureau, saying: "Love-the-People" movement is being carried out everywhere, if I don't confess to you, where else can I run?"

At present, areas that have ended the "Love-the-People Month" campaign are conscientiously summing up their experiences. Many places have proposed to regularize "Love-the-People" activities in the future, so that everything is to love the people and to love the people forever.

The Wuhan Traffic Police Women's Squad was established on March 8th last year. The squad has a total of 13 members. Originally, they were all engaged in internal affairs work in the Public Security Bureau. When the country launched a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the city's traffic became busier, and they voluntarily applied to the Party committee to work as traffic police officers. Over the past year, they have completed their tasks very well. No liability accidents have occurred at Jianghan Road and Zhongshan Avenue, the busiest roads in Wuhan, under their command, and they have been praised by the Party organization and the masses.

### 警爱民　民帮警　警民亲如手足  公安机关爱民月运动进一步密切了警民关系

    警爱民　民帮警　警民亲如手足
    公安机关爱民月运动进一步密切了警民关系
    新华社24日讯　全国各地的公安机关和民警普遍在春节前后开展了爱民月运动。通过这一运动，进一步密切了公安人员同人民群众的联系，人民群众更加积极地协助公安人员做好治安工作。
    在公安人员中开展爱民运动，这是在1958年7月间第九次全国公安会议上所决定的。按照那次会议的决议，今后每年都将在年终一个月或春节期间，在公安人员中集中地开展一次全国规模的爱民运动，以更好地发扬和提高我国公安战线上的优良传统和作风。
    广大人民都以极高的评价赞扬了人民警察这种优良的作风，他们说，警爱民，民爱警，只有在社会主义制度下，警察与人民才真正打成了一片。因此他们更加乐于接近和帮助人民警察，这种亲如手足的关系，也就大大地增强了对敌人专政的威力。
    在爱民月运动中，各地公安干部和人民警察首先认真学习了“人民警察八大纪律十项注意”，并且进行了热烈的讨论。通过他们的自我教育，广大干部和民警进一步明确了如何在实际工作中正确地区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，并且决心要巩固地树立对敌要狠、对内要和，全心全意为人民服务的思想，使每一个公安人员都自觉地成为党和人民手中光荣的驯服的专政工具。各地公安人员在进行自我教育的同时，还广泛地展开了大张旗鼓的宣传活动，多方面地征求群众的意见，并且掀起了为群众大办好事的热潮。据广东省广州、普宁等四十四个市、县的统计，人民警察在爱民月期间共为群众办了十五万二千多件各种各样的好事。广州市许多人民警察结合检查防火工作，为居民修改炉灶，仅中区人民警察就协助八百多户居民修改了炉灶。中区、北区的人民警察还帮助辖区内的烈军属和缺乏劳力的住户做了很多家务事，他们帮助这些住户劈柴、挑水、洗衣、扫地。山东省聊城专区的一个民警中队，从1月5日到10日的五天中，就为群众办了三百多件好事，他们共挖了圈肥四万三千斤，运肥二十九万五千多斤，收打粮食四万四千多斤，并帮助居民捕捉了大量老鼠和麻雀。安徽省淮河水上公安局田家庵派出所的人民警察，在爱民月期间帮助三十多个外地船民和过路旅客病患者到医院治疗，并且结合上船办户口或随船外出工作，和群众同吃同住同劳动，帮助船民处理了家庭纠纷和婚姻等问题一百二十多件。
    许多人民警察通过这些活动进一步改进了工作作风。哈尔滨市少数交通警察过去在处理违犯交通规章事件时，常常因为方式简单、态度生硬和群众争吵，现在普遍做到了“先礼后言，以礼待人”，而且还交了二百五十个朋友。这个市南岗交通警察中队还在火车站设立了“便民问事处”，一个月来共帮助旅客寻找机关、住地一万多次，人们同声称便。
    通过这些爱民活动，进一步密切了警民关系，到处都出现了警爱民、民帮警，共同搞好治安工作的新气象。广东省新会县一位八十七岁的老人李泳桃写诗歌颂爱民月说：“本月称呼是爱民，爱民何止今一月；长期服务为人民，肃清坏人护好人。”由于人民群众受到了爱民运动的教育，更加认识到保卫祖国建设、维持社会治安人人有责，他们主动检举坏人坏事。广东省台山县群众最近帮助公安机关揪出了漏网的残余反革命分子。贵州省都匀市的人民警察现在一上街，到处都能听到热情的招呼声，要了解什么情况群众都能积极反映。湖南省湘潭县民警大队高桥执勤点不久以前逃跑了一个犯人，民警在追捕中，一个妇女马上跑出来帮助捉人，犯人把这个妇女摔倒在地上，跌破了头，但她爬起来又追，一直到把这个犯人捉住。由于警民密切结合，加强了专政的威力，使一些暗藏的反革命分子和坏分子简直无处躲藏。流窜广东各地作案四年的盗窃惯犯伦志源向江门市公安机关自首时说：“到处都在搞爱民运动，我不向你们坦白还向哪里跑。”
    目前，已经结束爱民月运动的地区都正在认真总结经验，许多地方提出今后要使爱民活动经常化，做到事事爱民，永远爱民。（附图片）
    武汉市交通警女子班，是在去年3月8日成立的，全班共有十三人。原来他们都是在公安局搞内勤工作的。当全国掀起工农业生产大跃进时，全市交通更加繁忙，他们自动向党委申请去作交通民警工作。一年来她们很出色地完成了任务，在她们指挥的武汉最繁忙的江汉路和中山大道未出任何责任事故，得到党组织和群众的好评。
