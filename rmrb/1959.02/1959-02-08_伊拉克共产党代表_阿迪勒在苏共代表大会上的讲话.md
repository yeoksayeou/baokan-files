Xinhua News Agency, 6th. According to "Pravda" reports: Salam Adil, representative of the Iraqi Communist Party, delivered a congratulatory speech at the 21st Congress of the CPSU on the morning of February 2nd. The full text is as follows:

    Dear Comrades! Our delegation, on behalf of the Iraqi Communist Party and the Central Committee of the Party, extends its respects to the historically significant 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on behalf of all progressives in Iraq.

    Throughout its long years of struggle, the Iraqi Communist Party has always learned from the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its historically significant congresses their awareness, rich experience, and resolute and courageous spirit. The congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have summarized the essence of the flexible and unyielding implementation of Marxist-Leninist principles in the struggle for peace, socialism, and communism.

    Our broad masses of people have long recognized through personal experience the significance of the victories achieved by the Soviet Union for their own cause, for the cause of Iraq's liberation from imperialism, imperialist blocs, and foreign military bases, and for achieving national independence and ensuring national development and progress.

    When serving their British and American masters, the imperialist lackeys in Iraq showed great enthusiasm, and for many years they erected artificial barriers between our country and the Soviet Union, as well as other socialist countries. They spared no effort to turn our country into a military base and bridgehead for aggression against socialist countries. They tried to turn our people into tools of their aggressive plans. Baghdad is our glorious capital, but the notorious aggressive pact is named after it.

    However, in these difficult years, we, the Communists of Iraq, deeply believed in the awareness of our people, in their determination to struggle, and we believed that our people have a deep friendship with the great Soviet Union and other socialist countries. As soon as the glorious Iraqi Revolution of July 14th triumphed and the regime of the imperialist lackeys was overthrown, the government of the Republic of Iraq immediately established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries of the socialist camp. Later, it signed trade agreements with these countries and embarked on the road of developing friendly relations with them.

    From the very first days of the Iraqi Revolution, our people have benefited from this friendship. The landing of American and British troops in Lebanon and Jordan put the Republic of Iraq in real danger of armed imperialist aggression. But thanks to the firm position of the Soviet Union, the powerful support of the People's Republic of China, Bulgaria, and other socialist countries, as well as all forces of peace and freedom, the imperialists failed, and our people were able to defend this young republic. (Applause)

    Our people will always be deeply grateful to those loyal friends who supported them in their difficult times!

    Comrades! Although the imperialists' intentions to launch an armed aggression against our country have failed, they are now adopting roundabout tactics in order to achieve their goals and restore their rule over Iraq. They are trying to isolate Iraq among other Arab countries, and they are intimidating other Arab countries by widely slandering and spreading rumors about our national republic's system. The glorious Iraqi Revolution has contributed to the entire liberation movement of the Arab people. It has transformed Baghdad from a base for conspiracies and aggression against the Arab nation into a fortress for defending the independence of the Arab people, opposing the imperialists, and striving for peace! (Applause)

    All words and actions that oppose the Republic of Iraq together with the American imperialists ultimately serve the imperialists and no one else, and this can only harm the entire Arab liberation movement. On the contrary, our republic strives to strengthen Arab unity, especially to strengthen cooperation with the United Arab Republic. The Iraqi National United Front, which unites all national parties, opposes the imperialist conspiracies and propaganda, advocates consolidating fraternal relations with the United Arab Republic, advocates determining the best form of contact with it for the benefit of the broad masses of people of these two fraternal republics, and advocates using generally accepted democratic methods to achieve all of this.

    Any opposition to the communist movement in any Arab country will weaken the national movement in that country, cause division and fragmentation in the national movements of other Arab countries, and undermine the unity of these countries in the struggle against imperialism. Our people express their deep gratitude to the Arab Communists, especially the Syrian Communists, for their actions in defending the slogan of uniting with the Republic of Iraq against imperialism and Zionism.

    Starting from its own class consciousness, and due to its awareness of the importance and necessity of the unity of the Arab nation's anti-imperialist struggle, our party will resolutely fight against the reactionary factions in the Arab movement that harm the national interests of the peoples of Arab countries.

    In their struggle against the communist movement in Arab countries, the reactionary groups resort to hired writers, trying to run further ahead under the banner of so-called "national communism" or "Arab communism." In this regard, they rely on the direct assistance of the revisionists in Belgrade.

    In Iraq, the imperialists attempt to take advantage of ideological and political differences in the national movement. They try to incite and deepen these contradictions in order to split our ranks. They raise the tattered banner of the so-called "communist danger," wearing the mask of "defenders" of national interests. But the masses of the Arab and Kurdish peoples always expose their despicable intentions, discarding the ideas and elements that undermine our unity. As a result, the role of the National United Front is growing, and it now takes a consistent stand on a series of important national issues.

    Our party calls for strengthening the National United Front on a thorough democratic basis, actively playing its role by granting all five parties joining this United Front the freedom of political activity, allowing them to exercise power together with the patriotic soldiers led by our glorious republic's leader, the loyal and strong son of the Iraqi people, Kassem. (Applause) The Iraqi Communist Party calls for ensuring the necessary democratic conditions for the election of a constituent assembly, which will formulate a democratic constitution, taking into account the national rights of the Kurdish people of Iraq and our country's desire to form an alliance with independent Arab countries.

    Comrades! It is a great honor for us to be able to extend our congratulations to the glorious 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    This historically significant congress will help the broad masses of people all over the world to compare dying capitalism with the constantly triumphant socialism and communism.

    The Seven-Year Plan submitted to your congress for review is a new and reliable guarantee for the cause of world peace, a new guarantee for strengthening the powerful socialist camp. It is also a testament to the continuous victories of the Soviet system and Marxist-Leninist ideology as the vanguard of all mankind, the Soviet people, transition to the glorious summit of communism. (Applause)

    Comrade Khrushchev's report signifies a major step forward on the road to strengthening internationalist solidarity in all aspects.

    Long live the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union! (Applause)

    Long live the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union! (Applause)

    Long live the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union! (Stormy and prolonged applause. All stand up) (Attached picture)

    伊拉克共产党代表
    阿迪勒在苏共代表大会上的讲话
    新华社6日讯　据“真理报”报道：伊拉克共产党代表萨拉姆·阿迪勒2日上午在苏共第二十一次代表大会上致贺词，全文如下：
    亲爱的同志们！我们代表团代表伊拉克共产党和党中央委员会、代表伊拉克全体进步人士向苏联共产党有历史意义的第二十一次代表大会致敬。
    伊拉克共产党在自己悠长的斗争岁月里从来就是向光荣的苏联共产党和它的各次有历史意义的代表大会学习他们的觉悟性、极丰富的经验、坚决果敢的精神的。苏联共产党的历次代表大会总结了争取和平、争取社会主义和共产主义斗争中灵活地百折不挠地实现马克思列宁主义原则的精华。
    我国广大的人民群众早已根据亲身的体验认识到了苏联所获得的胜利对于他们切身的事业的意义，对于伊拉克摆脱帝国主义、帝国主义集团、外国军事基地的解放事业的意义，对于取得民族独立和保证民族发展和进步的意义。
    帝国主义在伊拉克的走狗为自己的英国老爷和美国老爷服务时表现得很热忱，多年来他们在我国和苏联之间，以及和其他社会主义各国之间筑起了一些人为的障壁。为了把我国变成侵略社会主义阵营各国的军事基地和桥头堡垒，他们费了许多力气。他们设法把我国人民变成他们侵略计划的工具。巴格达是我国光荣的首都，但是众所周知的侵略性的公约就是以它命名的。
    但是，在这些艰苦的年代里，我们，伊拉克的共产党人深深相信我国人民的觉悟，相信他们斗争的决心，我们相信我国人民对伟大的苏联和其他社会主义国家是有着深厚的友谊之情的。7月14日光荣的伊拉克革命刚一胜利，帝国主义走狗的政权一被推翻，伊拉克共和国政府便马上同苏联、中华人民共和国以及社会主义阵营的其他国家建立了外交关系。后来它又同这些国家签订了贸易协定，走上了同这些国家发展友好关系的道路。
    从伊拉克革命开始的头几天起，我国人民就得到了这种友谊的好处。美英军队在黎巴嫩和约旦的登陆，使伊拉克共和国面临着帝国主义武装侵略的实际危险。但是由于苏联的坚定不移的立场，由于中华人民共和国、保加利亚和其他社会主义国家以及和平与自由的一切力量的强有力的支援，帝国主义者失败了，我国人民才得以保卫住了这个年青的共和国。（鼓掌）
    我国人民将永远深深地感激那些在他们困难时刻支持过他们的忠实的朋友！
    同志们！虽然帝国主义者武装侵略我国的意图已经失败了，但是现在他们正在采取迂回的手法，以便达到自己的目的和恢复对伊拉克的统治。他们企图使伊拉克在其他阿拉伯国家中陷于孤立，对我们民族共和国的制度广泛进行污蔑和造谣来恐吓其他的阿拉伯国家。光荣的伊拉克革命已为阿拉伯人民的整个解放运动尽了力，它把巴格达从制造阴谋侵略阿拉伯民族的基地变成了保卫阿拉伯人民的独立、反对帝国主义者和争取和平的堡垒！（鼓掌）
    同美帝国主义者一起来反对伊拉克共和国的一切言行，归根结底只是为帝国主义者服务，而不是为其他任何人服务的，这只能使整个阿拉伯解放运动受到损害。我们的共和国与此相反，它力求加强阿拉伯的团结，特别是加强同阿拉伯联合共和国的合作。联合了全国一切民族党派的伊拉克民族统一阵线反对帝国主义的阴谋诡计和宣传，主张巩固同阿拉伯联合共和国的兄弟关系，主张为了这两个兄弟共和国的广大人民群众的利益来确定同它联系的最好形式，主张利用一般通用的民主方法来实现这一切。
    对任何阿拉伯国家的共产主义运动的任何反对，都会削弱这个国家的民族运动，使其他阿拉伯国家的民族运动发生分歧和分裂，破坏这些国家在反对帝国主义的斗争中的团结。我国人民怀着深深感激的心情表彰阿拉伯共产党人、特别是表彰叙利亚共产党卫护同伊拉克共和国团结起来反对帝国主义和犹太复国主义的口号的行为。
    我们党从自己的阶级自觉出发，由于意识到阿拉伯民族反帝斗争团结一致的重要性和必要性，将坚决地同阿拉伯运动中危害阿拉伯各国人民民族利益的反动派别进行斗争。
    反动集团在反对阿拉伯各国共产主义运动的斗争中求助于帮闲文人，力图在所谓“民族共产主义”或“阿拉伯共产主义”的口号下向前跑得更远一些。他们在这一方面依靠着贝尔格莱德的修正主义者的直接帮助。
    在伊拉克，帝国主义者企图从民族运动中的思想意识分歧和政治分歧中找便宜，他们竭力煽动和加深这些矛盾，以求分裂我们的队伍。他们举起所谓“共产主义危险”的破旧不堪的旗帜，戴着民族利益“保卫者”的假面具。但是阿拉伯族和库尔德族的人民群众总是揭穿了他们卑鄙的意图，把破坏我们的统一的思想和分子一并抛弃。结果，民族统一阵线的作用日益增长，它现在在一系列重要的民族问题上都采取一致的立场。
    我们党号召在彻底的民主基础上加强民族统一阵线，积极发挥它的作用，办法就是给予所有五个加入这一统一阵线的政党以政治活动的自由，让它们同以我们光荣的共和国的领导人、伊拉克人民忠实坚强的儿子卡塞姆为首的爱国军人并肩携手地共同行使政权。（鼓掌）伊拉克共产党号召保证必要的民主条件来进行立宪会议的选举，由立宪会议来制定民主的宪法，在制定宪法时要考虑到伊拉克库尔德族人民的民族权利和我国同独立的各阿拉伯国家联盟的意愿。
    同志们！我们有可能向光荣的苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会致贺，这对我们来说是很大的荣誉。
    这次有历史意义的代表大会，将能帮助全世界的广大的人民群众在垂死的资本主义和不断取得辉煌胜利的社会主义和共产主义之间进行比较。
    提交你们的代表大会审查的七年计划，是全世界和平事业的新的可靠的保证，是加强强大的社会主义阵营的新的保证。它也是苏维埃制度和马克思列宁主义思想在苏联人民这个全人类的先锋队向共产主义的光辉顶峰过渡的道路上不断取得胜利的证明。（鼓掌）
    赫鲁晓夫同志的报告意味着在加强各方面的国际主义团结的道路上向前迈进了一大步。
    苏联共产党中央委员会万岁！（鼓掌）
    苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会万岁！（鼓掌）
    光荣的苏联共产党万岁！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声。全体起立）（附图片）
