    British Prime Minister Chooses Auspicious Day for Trip
    By Our Correspondent Pan Fei
    British Prime Minister Macmillan announced in Parliament on the afternoon of February 5th that he would visit the Soviet Union on February 21st for a week to ten days. Foreign Secretary Lloyd will accompany him.
    The British Prime Minister's visit to the Soviet Union was arranged as early as two years ago. After Bulganin and Khrushchev visited Britain in the spring of 1956, the then British Prime Minister Eden decided to return the visit in May 1957. However, in October 1956, the Suez War broke out; subsequently, Eden was forced to step down due to the failure of the Suez War and left 10 Downing Street in January 1957. After Macmillan took office, the first major thing he was eager to do was to hold the Bermuda talks with Eisenhower. Regarding the visit to the Soviet Union, Macmillan neither cancelled the previous proposal nor determined the date, only expressing the hope to go to Moscow when it seemed "opportune in the view of the world."
    Now, almost overnight, Macmillan suddenly made the decision.
    What force emboldened Macmillan to make up his mind? What event made Macmillan believe that the current timing was just "opportune"?
    It is noted that when Macmillan decided to visit the Soviet Union, Britain's situation was not very pleasant. In the past year, Britain's international status, especially its status in the capitalist world, has declined sharply. The result of following the United States and pursuing a Cold War policy has made Britain an insignificant pawn in Washington's chess game; its ties with the Commonwealth countries have gradually loosened, and its influence in the Middle East has also shrunk to a corner. In terms of economy, the proportion of British manufactured goods in the capitalist world market has fallen from 21% in 1953 to 18% last year; in particular, the growth of West Germany's power, the emergence of the Paris-Bonn axis, the failure of the free trade zone plan, and the implementation of the European Common Market have put Britain in a difficult position in Western Europe.
    In this precarious situation, Britain is most sensitive to every development and change in the international situation. A recent prominent example is the shock caused by Mikoyan's visit to the United States in Britain. If you recall some of the discussions in London newspapers three or four weeks ago, you can imagine what Britain's mood was like. The "Daily Express" editorial said: "Mikoyan has achieved a great victory in the United States. On his way back, he should come to Britain to take a look." A few days later, when Mikoyan's visit to Britain was no longer possible, the "Daily Express" again mentioned the necessity of Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union. It wrote: Macmillan should "learn a lesson" from Mikoyan's visit. He should take some initiatives among the world's politicians. Mikoyan should be invited to Britain to talk about trade, and then Macmillan should go to the Soviet Union to talk about peace."
    The British general election may be held in May. The current political climate in Britain is not favorable to the Conservative Party. The decline in industrial production and the increase in unemployment are phenomena that cannot be changed in the short term. Many political observers here believe that Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union can at least ignite two hopes in the minds of British voters: one is that people hope that the international situation may ease; and the other is that people hope that trade between Britain and the Soviet Union may develop. The "Daily Mirror" wrote: Voters' "biggest expectation is that Macmillan will return with a trade agreement, thereby providing more jobs for British workers. In this way, the Conservative Party will undoubtedly be the victor in the general election."
    Regardless of Macmillan's motives for going to Moscow, the very fact that he is visiting the Soviet Union is of positive significance under the current circumstances. British public opinion hopes that Macmillan's trip will help ease the international situation and improve British-Soviet relations, which is a reasonable wish and is also in Britain's interests.

### 英国首相择吉出行

    英国首相择吉出行
    本报记者　潘非
    英国首相麦克米伦5日下午在议会宣布，他将在2月21日前往苏联，作为期一周到十天的访问。同行者将有外交大臣劳埃德。
    英国首相访问苏联，早在两年以前就曾经有所安排。在布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫于1956年春访问英国以后，当时的英国首相艾登即决定于1957年5月回聘。但是，1956年10月，苏伊士战争爆发了；接着，艾登由于苏伊士战争的失败而被迫下台，在1957年1月离开了唐宁街十号。麦克米伦上台以后，急于要做的第一件大事，是同艾森豪威尔举行百慕大会谈。对于访问苏联，麦克米伦既不取消前议，又不确定日期，只是表示希望“在世界观点看来是适合时宜”的时候，前去莫斯科。
    现在，几乎是在一夜之间，麦克米伦突然作出了决定。
    是什么力量使得麦克米伦鼓起了勇气，下定了决心呢？是什么事件使得麦克米伦认为当前的时机正好“适合时宜”呢？
    人们注意到，在麦克米伦决定访苏的时候，英国的处境是不很美妙的。最近一年来，英国的国际地位，首先是它在资本主义世界中的地位，已急剧衰落。追随美国、奉行冷战政策的结果，使英国成为华盛顿的棋局中的一员无足轻重的卒子；同英联邦国家的联系逐渐松弛了，在中东的势力也已经退缩到一隅。在经济方面，英国制成品在资本主义世界市场上所占的比重，已从1953年的21％，下降到去年的18％；特别是，西德力量的增长，巴黎—波恩轴心的出现，自由贸易区计划的失败，西欧共同市场的实施，使得英国在西欧遭到排挤，并处于困难之中。
    在这风雨飘摇的情况下，国际局势的每一发展和变化，英国是感受得最灵敏不过了。最近一个突出的例子，是米高扬访美在英国所引起的震动。如果回忆一下三、四个星期以前伦敦报纸的一些议论，就可以想像到英国是怎样一种心情了。“每日快报”的社论说：“米高扬在美国得到很大的胜利。在他的归途中，他应该到英国来看看。”几天以后，当米高扬访问英国已不可能成为事实的时候，“每日快报”又提到麦克米伦访问苏联的必要性。它写道：麦克米伦从米高扬的访问中，“应该学到教训。他应该在世界的政治家中采取一些主动。米高扬应被邀请到英国来谈贸易，然后麦克米伦应该到苏联去谈和平”。
    英国的大选有可能在5月间举行。目前英国国内的政治气候，对保守党来说并不是有利的。工业生产的下降，失业的增加，这些现象都不可能在短期内有所改变。这里的许多政治观察家认为，麦克米伦访问苏联，至少可以在英国选民的心里燃起两个希望：一是人们盼望国际局势有可能缓和；二是盼望英苏间的贸易有可能发展。“每日镜报”写道：选民们“最大的企望是，麦克米伦将带着一个贸易协议回来，由此对英国工人提供更多的工作。这样，保守党将毫无疑问地成为大选的胜利者。”
    不管麦克米伦是抱着什么动机到莫斯科去的。他访问苏联这一事实的本身，在目前的情况下是有积极意义的。英国的公众舆论希望麦克米伦此行能有助于缓和国际局势和改善英苏关系，这种愿望是合理的，而且也是符合英国的利益的。
