Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch from Asuncion: As the United States intensifies its plunder of the Paraguayan people through the Stroessner dictatorial regime and is turning the country into a US military strategic base, the Paraguayan people's anti-dictatorship struggle has been on the rise in recent years.

Paraguay is a relatively developed agricultural and pastoral country in Latin America, with three-quarters of its population of more than 1.6 million engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. Paraguay's limited industry, mining, and transportation are controlled by US monopoly capital. According to reports, the US "Pure Oil Company" and "International Products Corporation" recently obtained oil exploration rights from the Stroessner dictator in the Chaco mining area covering 300 hectares. At the same time, US monopoly enterprises excluded the original French contractor from a petroleum industry project in Paraguay.

The US "International Products Corporation" processes 60,000 head of cattle annually in this small South American country. At the same time, in order to facilitate economic plunder, the United States is "developing" Paraguay's "transportation industry." In addition, the United States recently provided the Paraguayan dictatorial government with a US$10 million loan through the International Monetary Fund and the Import Bank to implement a series of so-called "economic reforms," including a "free trading market," "credit restrictions," and "wage controls." As a result, Paraguay has experienced increasingly severe inflation and currency devaluation in recent years. The original official exchange rate between the Paraguayan Guarani and the US dollar was 60 to 1, but because Stroessner constantly yielded to US monopoly capital and revised the foreign exchange system, stipulating that Paraguay's receipts and expenditures in all aspects should adopt the free market exchange rate, the official exchange rate lost its practical role. The free market exchange rate controlled by the United States in April of last year was 111 Guaranis to one US dollar. The devaluation of the Paraguayan currency means that US monopoly capital can purchase Paraguayan agricultural products and industrial raw materials at low prices and pay meager wages to workers. For the vast majority of Paraguayan people, it means rising prices, unemployment, hunger, and being forced to flee abroad to seek a way out.

While the United States is carrying out cruel economic plunder of the Paraguayan people, it has recently intensified its military expansion in Paraguay. The United States has not only dragged Paraguay into the South Atlantic Treaty Organization, attempting to drive Paraguay to serve as cannon fodder for the United States, but is also accelerating the transformation of Paraguay into a US military base. According to reports, the Paraguayan government recently planned to relocate all farmers in the area between Barreiro Grande and Pilibuy in order to build an ammunition factory and an airplane runway there in accordance with the intentions of the US government. Argentine newspapers pointed out that the US approach is intended to "turn Paraguay into a base for intercontinental strategy." This plan includes building an atomic factory in the Salto del Guaira area, stepping up road construction, and laying an oil pipeline to transport Chaco oil to the Atlantic coast to supply the US fleet.

However, despite the fact that the United States colludes with the Stroessner dictatorial regime to impose brutal rule on the Paraguayan people, the flames of the Paraguayan people's movement for national independence are burning more and more intensely. News reports say that the "Army of Free Citizens for Paraguay" has recently appeared in Paraguay, with its headquarters located in southern Paraguay. A statement issued by the insurgent army said that their goal "is to abolish the existing autocratic regime and establish a democratic regime." Armed struggles have been launched in San José, Encarnación, and other places in Paraguay. In Pilar, south of Asuncion, there was a sailor's riot last year. According to "News Daily," in the Paraguayan capital, Asuncion, "the revolutionary movement is developing, and leaders of political groups are participating in this movement, including even certain representatives of the ruling 'National Republican Party'." Commenting on the situation in Paraguay, US "Christian Science Monitor" reporter Ingrey had to admit that in recent years, the Paraguayan people's movement against dictator Stroessner has "become more intense."

### 反对美国扶植的独裁政权  巴拉圭人民掀起武装斗争  起义军宣布要在国内建立民主政权

    反对美国扶植的独裁政权
    巴拉圭人民掀起武装斗争
    起义军宣布要在国内建立民主政权
    新华社1日讯　亚松森消息：由于美国通过斯特罗斯纳独裁政权加紧掠夺巴拉圭人民，并且正在把这个国家变为美国的军事战略基地，近年来巴拉圭人民的反独裁斗争日趋高涨。
    巴拉圭是拉丁美洲一个农牧业比较发达的国家，全国一百六十多万人口中有四分之三的人从事农牧业。巴拉圭仅有的一点工矿和交通运输业为美国垄断资本所控制。据报道，美国“普耳石油公司”和“国际产品公司”不久以前还从斯特罗斯纳独裁者那里取得了在查科矿区面积达三百公顷的石油开采权。同时，美国独占企业排斥了原先法国在巴拉圭承包的一项石油工业工程。
    美国“国际产品公司”在这个南美小国每年的肉类加工量中达六万头。同时，为了便于经济上的掠夺，美国正在“发展”巴拉圭的
  “交通运输业”。此外，美国不久以前还通过国际货币基金组织和进口银行给巴拉圭独裁政府一千万美元的贷款，来实行所谓一系列的“经济改革”，包括“自由交易市场”、“信贷限制”和“工资控制”等。这样一来，造成了近年来巴拉圭的日益严重的通货膨胀和货币贬值。巴拉圭原来的瓜拉尼和美元的官方兑换率是六十比一，但是由于斯特罗斯纳不断向美国垄断资本让步，修改了外汇制度，规定巴拉圭在各方面的收支一律采用外汇自由市场牌价，以致官方牌价失去了它的实际作用。美国去年4月掌握的外汇自由市场牌价是一百一十一瓜拉尼换一美元。巴拉圭货币的贬值，意味着美国垄断资本能够以低价收购巴拉圭的农产品和工业原料，并且支付职工微薄的工资，而对于巴拉圭广大人民来说，则是物价高涨、失业、饥饿和被迫流亡国外寻找出路。
    美国在对巴拉圭人民实行残酷的经济掠夺的同时，近来还变本加厉地对巴拉圭进行军事扩张。美国不仅把巴拉圭拉入了南大西洋公约组织，企图驱使巴拉圭充当美国的炮灰，并且还在加紧把巴拉圭变为美国的军事基地。据报道，巴拉圭政府不久前打算迁走巴雷洛格兰德和庇利比布伊之间的地区的全部农民，以便按照美国政府的意图在那里建设一所军火厂和一条飞机升降跑道。阿根廷报纸指出，美国的作法是打算“把巴拉圭变成洲际战略的一个基地”。这个计划包括在萨尔托德尔瓜伊拉地区建立一所原子工厂，加紧建设道路和敷设一条油管，以便把查科的石油运送到大西洋岸，来供应美国的舰队。
    但是，尽管美国勾结着斯特罗斯纳独裁政权对巴拉圭人民施行残暴的统治，巴拉圭人民争取民族独立运动的火焰却愈来愈强烈地燃烧起来了。消息说，不久以前在巴拉圭已经出现了“争取巴拉圭自由公民军”，这支军队的司令部设在南巴拉圭。起义军发表的公告说，他们的目的“是要取消现存的专制政权，建立民主政权”。在巴拉圭的圣约瑟、恩卡尔纳西昂以及其他一些地方掀起了武装斗争。在亚松森以南的彼拉尔市，去年曾发生水手的骚动。据“新闻报”报道，在巴拉圭的首都亚松森，“革命运动正在发展，参加这一运动的有政治集团的领导人，其中甚至包括执政党‘国家共和党’的某些代表人物”。美国“基督教科学箴言报”记者英格雷在评述巴拉圭的局势时不得不承认，近年来巴拉圭人民反对独裁者斯特罗斯纳的人民运动，“更为高涨了”。
