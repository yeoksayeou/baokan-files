Livestock Covering the Mountains and Plains, Grain Filling the Granaries
The Experience of the Guandian Brigade's Great Leap Forward in Animal Husbandry
Yang Xiangming, First Secretary of the Ying Shan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Hubei Province

Since the Great Leap Forward, especially after the establishment of the People's Commune, Guandian Brigade (Management District) of the Haodian People's Commune in our county, under the guidance of the policy of comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, has made further leaps forward in the development of animal husbandry. By the end of last December, the number of draught cattle had increased from 1,009 in January to 1,489; the number of cows, both pregnant and recently calved, reached 128% of the number of cows of breeding age; the number of pigs increased from 1,995 to 11,257 (collective pig raising accounted for 90% of the total); and the number of goats increased from 187 to 3,564 (including 2,100 purchased).

Due to the great development of animal husbandry production, the amount of fertilizer, income, and animal power has greatly increased. Although the soil here is barren and water is scarce, the agricultural production of the entire team and the lives of the vast majority of commune members have improved significantly. This year, the entire team accumulated 670,000 dan of cattle, pig, and goat manure, which was applied to 8,822 mu of land; the per mu yield of grain increased from 630 jin last year to 1,085.5 jin; and the average income per commune member increased from 75 yuan in 1957 to 150 yuan.

The rapid development of cattle, pigs, and sheep in Guandian Brigade is mainly due to the Party Branch strengthening its leadership over animal husbandry production, raising the awareness of cadres and the masses about the development of animal husbandry, comprehensively arranging labor, and overcoming a series of difficulties such as feed and prevention of animal diseases.

Last spring, when the Party Branch proposed the plan of "two, ten, four for cattle, pigs, and sheep (that is, an average of two cattle, ten pigs, and four sheep per household)," many cadres and commune members had doubts about this plan. In response to these ideological concerns, while debating the agricultural production plan, the Party Branch raised the questions of whether the development of animal husbandry has a significant impact on the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, whether animal husbandry should be greatly developed, whether the plan can be realized and how to realize it, and whether engaging in animal husbandry is glorious, and let the vast majority of cadres and commune members start to debate. After the debate, conservative ideas were criticized, and everyone's understanding was corrected, so that the plan for developing animal husbandry took root among the masses.

On the basis of unified thinking and understanding, in order to promote the great development of cattle, pig, and sheep production, the brigade established a professional team for managing animal husbandry, composed of Liu Hongguang, the second secretary of the Party Branch, animal husbandry cadres, veterinarians, and deputy captains of each production team, totaling 13 people. The entire team also drew 398 commune members (accounting for 22% of the team's total semi-labor force) to form 132 professional groups to participate in animal husbandry production. These specialized management cadres and professional personnel are specifically responsible for the feeding and management of cattle, pigs, and sheep, and personally engage in "experimental fields," ensuring that work is arranged, inspected, evaluated, and competed, constantly discovering problems and solving problems, summarizing experience, and promoting it comprehensively. Due to the full play of the role of professional teams and professional personnel, animal husbandry production has never been relaxed due to other shock campaigns.

At the same time, the Party Branch also led the entire team to conduct a comprehensive adjustment and innovation of the remuneration issue, reward and punishment system, and feeding and breeding methods. For example, in the development of cattle, a comprehensive assessment of all cows was made, breeding tasks were assigned, and a system was established to give a certain reward to the feeder for each calf that is successfully bred. As a result, a mass movement to add feed to promote estrus and protect livestock and fetuses was immediately formed comprehensively. The feeders also implemented "two guarantees" (guarantee cost, guarantee production) and "three fixes" (fix tasks, fix feed, and regular evaluation). This greatly strengthened the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the feeders. In order to make the development of livestock more and better, the entire team also established three breeding stations and selected 26 breeding bulls and 12 breeding boars, ensuring planned breeding.

The development of livestock must pay attention to solving the feed problem. Judging from the situation here, feed is available in every season and everywhere. As long as labor is arranged regularly and the five-character method of "planting" (planting on field edges, barren land, and open spaces), "raising" (raising in ponds), "collecting" (collecting on mountains), "gathering" (gathering in threshing grounds), and "storing" (storing in jars or cellars) is fully implemented, the feed is inexhaustible. At present, this brigade also has 3.4 million jin of feed stored, which can meet the needs of winter and spring pig feed.

With the leap forward development of cattle, pig, and sheep production, the prevention and control of epidemics must keep up. This brigade fully implemented the policy of "prevention is more important than treatment," achieving early treatment for diseases and early prevention when there are no diseases, and eliminating epidemics wherever they occur. The specific methods, in addition to generally achieving "three diligences" (diligent feeding, diligent inspection, diligent bedding), "four cleans" (clean water, clean feed, clean troughs, clean pens), and conducting preventive injections for cattle, pigs, and sheep respectively.

### 牲畜遍山野　粮食装满仓  关店大队畜牧业大跃进的经验

    牲畜遍山野　粮食装满仓
    关店大队畜牧业大跃进的经验
    中共湖北省应山县委第一书记　杨向明
    大跃进以来，尤其是建立人民公社后，我县郝店人民公社关店大队（管理区），在农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展的方针指导下，畜牧业的发展更向前跃进了一步。到去年12月底为止，耕牛由1月份的一千零九头上升到一千四百八十九头，母牛连生带怀，达适龄母牛的128％；猪由一千九百九十五头，增长到一万一千二百五十七头（集体养猪占总数的90％）；山羊由一百八十七只发展到三千五百六十四只（包括购买二千一百只）。
    由于畜牧业生产的大发展，肥料、收入、畜力大量增加，尽管这里土质瘠薄，水源缺乏，但全队的农业生产和广大社员的生活都有比较显著的提高。今年，全队共积牛、猪、羊粪六十七万担，下田八千八百二十二亩；粮食单产由去年的六百三十斤增加到一千零八十五斤半；社员每人平均收入由1957年的七十五元增加到一百五十元。
    关店大队的牛、猪、羊能够迅速发展，主要是党总支加强了对畜牧业生产的领导，提高了干部和群众对发展畜牧业的认识，全面地安排了劳力，并且克服了饲料、防治畜疫等一系列的困难的结果。
    去年春天，当党总支提出“牛、猪、羊，二、十、四（即每户平均二头牛，十头猪，四只羊）”的规划的时候，不少干部和社员对这个规划有怀疑。党总支针对这些思想顾虑，在辩论农业生产规划的同时，提出了发展畜牧业对农业生产大跃进的作用大不大，畜牧业要不要大发展，规划能不能实现和如何实现以及搞畜牧业光荣不光荣等问题，让广大干部和社员展开辩论。经过辩论，保守思想被批判了，大家的认识也端正了，使发展畜牧业的规划在群众中生了根。
    在思想认识统一了的基础上，为了促进牛、猪、羊生产的大发展，大队以党总支第二书记刘宏光和畜牧干部、兽医人员，以及各生产队的副队长共十三人成立了管畜牧业的专业班子。全队还抽了三百九十八个社员（占全队整半劳力的22％），成立了一百三十二个专业组，参加畜牧业生产。这些专管干部和专业人员，专门负责牛、猪、羊的饲养管理工作，并且亲自搞“试验田”，作到工作有布置、有检查、有评比、有竞赛，不断发现问题解决问题，总结经验，全面推广。由于充分发挥了专业班子和专业人员的作用，从来没有因为别项突击运动而放松了畜牧生产。
    与此同时，党总支还领导全队对报酬问题、奖惩制度、饲养繁殖方法进行了一次全面调整和革新。如在发展牛方面，对所有母牛作了全面鉴定，分配了繁殖任务，制订了配准一头小牛给饲养员一定奖励的制度。这样一来，一个群众性的加料催情、护畜保胎运动立即全面形成了。对饲养员还实行了“两包”（包成本、包生产量），“三定”（定任务、定饲料、定期评比）。这样就大大加强了饲养员的积极性和责任感。为使牲畜发展的又多又好，全队还建立了三所配种站，选择了二十六头种公牛，十二头种公猪，作到了有计划的进行配种。
    发展牲畜必须注意解决饲料问题。从这里的情况看，饲料是季季有、处处有的，只要经常安排劳力，全面贯彻“种”（田头地角荒田空地种）、养（塘里养）、采（山上采）、集（禾场集）、存（坛缸内或窖中存）五个字的方法，饲料是取之不尽、用之不竭的。目前这个大队还储有饲料三百四十万斤，可以满足冬春养猪饲料的需要。
    牛猪羊生产的飞跃发展，疫病防治工作必须迎头赶上。这个大队全面贯彻了“防重于治”的方针，做到了有病早治，无病早防，疫病发生在哪里消灭在哪里。其具体方法，除了普遍作到“三勤”（勤喂养、勤检查、勤垫栏），“四净”（水净、料净、槽净、栏圈净）外，并对牛、猪、羊分别进行预防注射。（附图片）
