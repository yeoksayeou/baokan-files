    May the moon be full and people live long, the bright become brighter, and the immortal forever immortal!
    Mao Dun
    We just celebrated the Lantern Festival, and now we are celebrating Dr. Du Bois's ninety-first birthday, which coincides with our old saying: "May the moon be full and people live long."
    Dr. Du Bois is a famous American historian and writer. His life has been dedicated to opposing racial discrimination, striving for the long-term interests of the American people, for the cause of human progress, and for defending peace, making great contributions.
    He held a deep friendship with the Chinese people, and he condemned the American ruling group's criminal behavior of hostility towards the Chinese people.
    In Dr. Du Bois, we see the wisdom and heroism of black people, and the American people's traditions of peace, freedom, and fraternity. His righteous struggle provided strong support for the progressive movements in the United States and Latin America, and had a great impact on the independence movements of African blacks, thereby also giving great encouragement to the just struggles of good people all over the world.
    Dr. Du Bois's life's efforts have not been in vain. Today, February 23, 1959, on the occasion of his ninety-first birthday, a new situation that determines the fate of mankind has emerged on a global scale. The Soviet Union's first artificial planet is orbiting in space with the hammer and sickle and the red flag with the five-pointed star. The magnificent Soviet Seven-Year Plan shows the people of the world the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. The economic development of China and other socialist countries, as well as the strong unity and fraternal friendship of the socialist camp, contrast sharply with the economic recession, mutual suspicion, and disintegration of the aggressive and bellicose imperialist groups. The revolutionary fire in Latin America and Africa is about to burn down the last section of the chains of colonialism: the forces of light are growing stronger and stronger, and the forces of darkness will inevitably be eliminated in the end!
    All these inspiring, magnificent events and wonderful future prospects are inseparable from Dr. Du Bois's lifelong efforts.
    We respectfully wish the elderly Dr. Du Bois to make more and greater contributions to the interests of the people, and we respectfully wish him to become more courageous as he gets older and to further exert his life's vitality!
    May the moon be full and people live long, the bright become brighter, and the immortal forever immortal! (Attached picture)

    愿月圆人寿，光明的更光明，不朽的永远不朽！
    茅盾
    刚过了元宵佳节，又来庆祝杜波依斯博士的九十一岁华诞，正合着我们一句古话：月圆人寿。
    杜波依斯博士是美国著名的历史学家和作家，他的一生都是为了反对种族歧视、为了美国人民的长远利益、为了人类的进步事业，为了保卫和平，作出了巨大的贡献。
    他对中国人民怀着深厚的友谊，他谴责美国统治集团仇视中国人民的罪恶行为。
    在杜波依斯博士身上，我们看到了黑人的智慧和英勇，看到了美国人民的和平、自由、博爱的传统。他的正义的斗争，给美国以及拉丁美洲的进步运动以有力的支持，给非洲黑人的独立运动以巨大的影响，从而也对全世界善良人民的正义的斗争给予了巨大的鼓舞。
    杜波依斯博士一生的努力不是徒然的。今天，1959年2月23日，在他九十晋一寿辰的时候，在全世界范围决定人类命运的新局面已经出现。苏联的第一人造行星正带着镰刀锤头和五角星的红旗遨游太空，宏伟的苏联七年计划昭示全世界人民以社会主义制度的无比优越性，中国和社会主义各国的经济发展以及社会主义阵营的坚强团结和兄弟友谊正对比着侵略好战的帝国主义集团的经济衰退和互相猜忌，分崩离析，拉丁美洲、非洲的革命怒火正要烧毁殖民主义的最后一段镣索：光明势力越来越壮大，黑暗势力最后必然要被消灭！
    所有这些令人鼓舞的壮丽的大事件和美妙的未来远景，和杜波依斯博士一生的努力是分不开的。
    我们敬祝高龄的杜波依斯博士将为人民的利益作出更多更大的贡献，敬祝他愈老愈勇、愈加发挥他的生命的活力！
    愿月圆人寿，光明的更光明，不朽的永远不朽！（附图片）
