This Year Will Surely Surpass Last Year
By Our Reporter Gu Weijin

The Standing Committee meeting of the CCP Pingyuan County Committee in Shandong Province has concluded. This year, Pingyuan County will plant 1.22 million mu of wheat, aiming for a yield of 2,000 jin per mu. Pingyuan County has often suffered from droughts and floods in the past, but why are they daring to propose such a high target?

Last year, the county's grain yield was 499 jin per mu, doubling that of 1957. The whole county basically solved the problem of grain shortage that had plagued it for years, but it was not yet wealthy. This year, Pingyuan County has many favorable conditions for striving for a bumper wheat harvest. For example, after collectivization, labor and means of production can be mobilized and used more rationally and effectively on a larger scale; with last year's bumper harvest, there is a solid material foundation for striving for a greater harvest this year. But more importantly, it is the enthusiasm of the people. The whole county is determined to greatly surpass last year this year.

What conditions can make the target of 2,000 jin per mu a reality? Xu Zhiyu, the county party secretary, told me that the first is that the water conservancy problem in Pingyuan County has been relatively thoroughly solved. In the past, droughts and floods often occurred here. Although some progress was made in water conservancy construction last year, it was still not possible to control disasters well. Only 50% of the wheat area was irrigated once from sowing to harvest. This year, the whole county has realized a network of rivers and mechanized wells, with sufficient water sources, and most of the wheat fields can achieve gravity irrigation. All the county's 1.2 million mu of wheat can generally be irrigated five or six times. The amount of fertilizer applied has also greatly increased. Last year, each mu of wheat averaged 1,000 to 1,500 jin of base fertilizer, and topdressing did not fully keep up. What about this year? General wheat fields are fertilized with 50,000 jin of organic fertilizer, 100,000 jin of smoked soil, and 3 jin of bacterial fertilizer as base fertilizer; high-yield fields and satellite fields will have their fertilizer application increased by more than double, and topdressing is planned for four or five times. The depth of tillage has been increased from four inches last year to about one foot five inches this year, and some high-yield fields and satellite fields have been deeply ploughed to a depth of three to five feet. This year, all good seeds will be used, while last year only 20% of wheat fields used good seeds, and the seeding rate has been increased from 8 to 10 jin per mu last year to 30 to 50 jin. Other tasks, such as tool reform and pest control, have also been done better than in previous years.

At present, the vast number of cadres and masses are trying every means to do a good job in wheat field management. From the county to the commune to the team, the first secretary is in command, and wheat field management command organizations have been established. Communes generally implement the system of cadres being sent down level by level, so that each battalion has a commune party committee, each company has a general branch committee member, and each platoon has a cadre. From the secretary to the general cadre, all are good at being three members (commander, combatant, and technician). The Wheat Field Management Command has also formulated technical operating procedures according to local conditions, so that the masses can understand how to ensure the quality of wheat field management and change the past rough farming habits.

With the strengthening of leadership, a new situation has emerged in wheat field management. When wheat entered the period of concentrated irrigation, topdressing, and frost prevention, 300,000 people in the county were involved in this work. Under the heroic slogan of "Go all out and aim high, don't relax wheat field management, overcome ground frost and cold weather, and be a hero in irrigation and topdressing," people braved the severe cold and fought day and night in the wheat fields, so that the 1.2 million mu of wheat were generally irrigated and topdressed twice before the Spring Festival, and the high-yield fields and satellite fields were irrigated and topdressed three or four times or more.

In order to regularize wheat field management, people's communes have generally established professional teams, promoted the field management responsibility system, and implemented "four packages" (the commune is responsible for the cultivated area, the district is responsible for the square, the team is responsible for the block, and the group is responsible for the mu) and "nine fixings" (fixing personnel, fixing land plots, fixing time, fixing quantity and quality, fixing output targets, fixing animal power, fixing water sources and tools, fixing fertilizer, fixing rewards and punishments), so that each square and block of wheat field is managed by someone, the responsibilities are clear, and the tasks are specific, with fixed leadership and labor. In order to ensure that wheat field management is done well, many team members set up sheds in the fields, eat and live there without going home, until the wheat is harvested.

Since last winter, the county has organized more than 700 large and small inspections, evaluations, and on-site visits. The method of inspection and evaluation is: "look" (thoroughly inspect level by level, conduct good and bad evaluations), "debate" (look and discuss, affirm achievements, find problems, conduct praise and criticism), "learn" (learn leadership experience and technical measures), "promote" (affirm experience and immediately promote it by telephone). At the same time, carry out the movement of checking seedlings and comparing measures, checking comprehensive management and comparing the upgrading of three types of seedlings, checking topdressing and comparing fertilizer accumulation and production, checking winter irrigation and comparing the combination of water conservancy construction and use, checking special personnel in charge and comparing the implementation of the responsibility system, checking care for commune members' lives and comparing reasonable arrangements for time, checking labor arrangements and comparing work efficiency, and checking determination and comparing enthusiasm. Therefore, a wave of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced has been generally set off in the county, further promoting the wheat field management movement. Through four inspections and evaluations, the Fifth Battalion of Liutun People's Commune selected Xin Honghai, the hard-working and deeply committed third company commander, and four others as red banner cadres, which promoted 27 company and platoon cadres to take the lead in working with commune members, greatly boosting the labor enthusiasm of the commune members. The Encheng People's Commune adopted the method of six checks and six comparisons to find out the reasons why the work could not keep up with others: for example, by checking the leadership personally taking command and comparing it with the three togethers with commune members (eating, living, and working together), it was found that among the ten branch secretaries and twenty-three team leaders in the entire battalion, only one branch secretary worked with commune members, and the other cadres were busy with affairs; by checking the water source and comparing the water use tools, it was found that among the 264 wells in the entire battalion, only 84 were used, 150 waterwheels were used, only 109 were used, and none of the six reservoirs were used. The problems found were solved in a timely manner.

    今年定能胜去年
    本报记者　古维进
    中共山东省平原县委的常委会议已经结束了。今年，平原县种小麦一百二十二万亩，要求亩产二千斤。平原县以往经常发生旱灾和涝灾，但是他们为什么敢于提出这样高的指标呢？
    去年，这个县的粮食亩产四百九十九斤，比1957年翻了一番，全县基本上解决了历年来的缺粮问题，但是并不富裕。今年平原县争取小麦大丰收有许多有利条件。比如公社化以后，劳动力和生产资料可以在更大的范围内更合理更有效地统一调动使用；有了去年的丰收，今年争取更大的丰收有了雄厚的物质基础。但更重要的是人们的干劲，全县人民一心要今年大大地胜过去年。
    有哪些条件可以使亩产二千斤的指标成为现实呢？县委书记许志玉对我说，首先是平原县的水利问题得到比较彻底的解决。过去这里经常发生旱灾和涝灾，去年的水利建设虽然有了一些成绩，还不能很好的控制灾害，小麦从下种到收获，只有50％的面积浇了一次水。今年全县实现了河网化和机井化，水源充足，绝大部分麦田可以做到自流灌溉。全县一百二十余万亩小麦，一般可以浇水五、六遍。施肥量也大大增加了，去年每亩小麦平均上底肥一千至一千五百斤，追肥也没有全部跟上。今年呢？一般麦田施有机肥料五万斤，熏土十万斤，细菌肥料三斤为底肥；高产田和卫星田，施肥量还要增加一倍以上，计划追肥四、五遍。土地耕深已由去年的四寸加深到今年的一尺五寸左右，一些高产田和卫星田深耕达三至五尺。今年全部良种化，而去年只有20％麦田采用良种，下种量由去年每亩八至十斤提高到三十至五十斤。其他，如工具改革、防治虫害等工作也都比往年做得好。
    目前，广大干部和群众正在千方百计地设法搞好麦田管理，从县到社、到队，都以第一书记挂帅，建立了麦田管理指挥机构；各公社普遍实行干部层层下放，做到营营有公社党委，连连有总支委员，排排有干部，从书记到一般干部都当好三员（指挥员、战斗员、技术员）。麦田管理指挥部还因地制宜地制定技术操作规程，使群众了解如何保证麦田管理质量，改变过去耕作粗放的习惯。
    随着领导工作的加强，麦田管理工作出现了新的局面。当小麦进入突击浇水、追肥、防冻的时候，全县有三十万人投入这个工作，在
  “鼓足干劲争上游，麦田管理不放松，战胜地冻和天寒，浇水追肥称英雄”的豪迈口号下，人们冒着严寒，日夜战斗在麦田里，使一百二十余万亩小麦在春节以前普遍浇水、追肥各两次，高产田和卫星田浇水追肥三、四次以上。
    为了使麦田管理工作经常化，各人民公社普遍建立了专业队，推行田间管理责任制，实行“四包”（社包耕作区，区包方，队包块，组包亩包畦）“九定”（定人员、定地块、定时间、定数量与质量、定产量指标、定畜力、定水源与工具、定肥料、定奖惩），使方方、块块麦田有人管理，责任分明，任务具体，领导和劳力固定。为了保证把麦田管理好，许多队员们在地里搭起窝棚，吃住不回家，直到小麦收割为止。
    去冬以来，全县组织大小检查评比、现场参观达七百多次。检查评比的方法是：“看”（逐级深入检查，进行好坏评比）、“辩”（边看、边议、肯定成绩，找出问题，进行表扬批评）、“学”（学习领导经验，技术措施）、“推”（肯定经验，立即打电话推广）。同时开展查苗子、比措施，查全面管理、比三类苗升级，查追肥、比积肥和造肥，查冬灌、比水利建设与使用相结合，查专人负责、比责任制的贯彻执行，查关心社员生活、比合理安排时间，查劳力安排、比工效，查决心、比干劲的八比八查运动。全县因此普遍掀起了比先进，学先进，赶先进的浪潮，进一步推动了麦田管理运动。刘屯人民公社五营通过四次检查评比，评出艰苦深入、积极肯干的三连长辛洪海等五人为红旗干部，推动了二十七名连排干部带头与社员共同劳动，大大鼓舞了社员的劳动积极性。恩城人民公社采取六查六比的办法，找出工作赶不上别人的原因：例如通过查领导亲自挂帅，比与社员三同（同吃、同住、同劳动），发现全营十个支部书记，二十三个队长，只有一个支部书记与社员一块劳动，其他的干部都忙于事务；通过查水源比水利用具，发现全营二百六十四眼井，只利用了八十四眼，一百五十部水车，只利用了一百零九部，六个水库，一个也未用。查出的这些问题都及时得到解决。
