Gradually Ascending to Heaven
　　Wang Pu

　　Compared to manual operation, mechanized production can increase product quantity, save product costs, save labor, reduce the intensity of physical labor, and improve labor productivity. In short, there are many benefits. Therefore, in the industrial and agricultural sectors, and wherever machines can replace manual operations, gradually achieving mechanization is one of the main goals of China's technological revolution.

　　But how to achieve mechanization? And who will achieve it? When the Jingxi Mining Bureau launched a technological revolution movement centered on mechanization, it launched a debate on this issue. The Jingxi Mining Bureau was originally an enterprise with a considerable degree of mechanization, but at the same time, a large number of workers were engaged in heavy physical labor. There are quite a few enterprises like this in our country. There are even more enterprises that produce entirely by manual labor. Therefore, it is very important to figure out how to achieve mechanization.

　　To achieve mechanization, there are two methods: "ascending to heaven in one step" and "gradually ascending to heaven." The so-called "ascending to heaven in one step" means that the state invests heavily, and all production is mechanized at once. The so-called "gradually ascending to heaven" means that without or with little state investment, through vigorous mass movements and technological revolutions, mechanized production is gradually implemented. In the words of the workers of the Jingxi Mining Bureau, it is "self-reliance," "self-made and self-used, arming ourselves." We need both of these methods, but after all, there are not many that can ascend to heaven in one step. In particular, for existing enterprises to change from manual operation to mechanical operation, the most important method is still "gradually ascending to heaven," rather than "ascending to heaven in one step."

　　The key to "gradually ascending to heaven" is to carry out mass movements on a large scale. The larger the scale of the mass movement, the more people who start to "self-reliantly" and "self-made and self-used," the bigger the steps will be, and the faster they will ascend to "heaven." The Jingxi Mining Bureau carried out mass movements on a large scale, and everyone took action. In just fifty days, out of the original 7,564 workers engaged in physical labor, 6,223 got rid of heavy physical labor and achieved mechanized or semi-mechanized production. Although the quality of the machines they made themselves may not be ideal, and the efficiency may not be as good as real "foreign" machines, it is always a big step towards mechanization. The experience of the Jingxi Mining Bureau is very useful.

    逐步登天
    王朴
    比起手工操作来，机械化生产可以提高产品数量，节约产品成本，节约劳动力，降低人的体力劳动强度，提高劳动生产效率。总之，好处很多。所以，在工业部门、农业部门，在一切可以用机械代替手工操作的地方，逐步实现机械化，是我国技术革命的主要目标之一。
    但是，怎样实现机械化呢？由谁来实现呢？京西矿务局在开展以机械化为中心的技术革命运动的时候，曾经就这个问题展开一场辩论。京西矿务局原是一个具有相当机械化程度但同时又有大量工人从事笨重的体力劳动的企业，像这样的企业，在我们国家里相当多。完全以手工劳动进行生产的企业就更多。所以，搞清楚怎样实现机械化这个问题，十分重要。
    实现机械化，可以有“一步登天”和“逐步登天”的两种方法，所谓“一步登天”，就是由国家大量投资，一下子就使生产全部机械化。所谓“逐步登天”，就是不用或者少用国家投资，通过大搞群众运动，开展技术革命，逐步实行机械化生产。用京西矿务局工人的话来说，就是“自拉自唱，自力更生”，“自制自用，自己武装自己。”这两种方法我们都需要，可是能一步登天的，毕竟不多，特别是现有企业要从手工操作变为机械操作，最主要的方法还是“逐步登天”，而不是“一步登天”。
    “逐步登天”的关键是大搞群众运动。群众运动规模越大，动手“自拉自唱”、“自制自用”的人越多，步子就迈得大，登“天”就快。京西矿务局大搞群众运动，人人动手，仅仅五十天功夫，原来七千五百六十四名从事体力劳动的工人中，就有六千二百二十三人摆脱了笨重的体力劳动，实现机械化或半机械化生产。虽然，他们自制的机械质量可能还不够理想，效率可能比不上真正的“洋”机械，但总是向机械化迈出了大大的一步。京西矿务局的这一条经验是非常有用的。
