    Universally Inspect Seeds
    Improve Storage Systems
    The Yanggao County Dabaichi Commune Party Committee in Shanxi Province organized a specialized team to conduct a universal inspection of all seeds. Judging from the results of the inspection, each village had retained one and a half sets of seeds according to the planting plan. Through the inspection, the responsibility for management was further clarified, ensuring that inspections are carried out at any time, and that appropriate temperature is maintained by adding insulation or venting air according to changes in temperature. All grain seeds in the villages that were improperly stored or had unclear markings were re-weighed or moved to appropriate locations. In the past, the storage of millet and sorghum seeds was not good enough. Now, they are all stored in woven sorghum stalk bins or vats, with signs inserted to clarify who is responsible for their safekeeping, and a system of temperature testing every three days has been established. To have a clear understanding, all villages universally tested the germination rate, which was generally around 97%.

    普遍检查种籽
    健全保管制度
    山西阳高县大百尺公社党委组织了专业队，对所有籽种进行了普遍检查。从检查的情况来看，各村都按种植计划留足了一套半籽种。通过检查，进一步明确了专人负责管理，保证随时检查，根据气温变化适当加盖保温或放气通风，保持适量温度。对村里的粮食籽种，存放不当和底码不清的一律进行了过秤或改放在适当的地方。过去对谷种和高粱种保管的不够好，现在都用荆囤席囤和缸存放起来，插上了牌子，明确了专人保管，并建立了三天一试温的制度。为达到心中有底，各村都普试了发芽率，一般都在97％左右。（玉甲、景科）
