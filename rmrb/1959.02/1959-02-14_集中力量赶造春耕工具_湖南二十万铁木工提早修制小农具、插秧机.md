Concentrating Efforts to Rush Manufacture Spring Ploughing Tools
Hunan's 200,000 Iron and Wood Workers Advance Repair and Production of Small Farm Tools and Rice Transplanters

(Reported by this newspaper) While vigorously developing water conservancy and manure accumulation tools, Hunan is also advancing the manufacture and repair of various tools needed for spring ploughing. According to statistics from January 20th, over 7,000 farm tool factories across the province have organized more than 200,000 iron and wood workers to comprehensively repair small farm tools and manufacture rice transplanters. The province has already manufactured over 20,000 simple rice transplanters and trained more than 20,000 workers in manufacturing and using them. Currently, the work of manufacturing and promoting rice transplanters is being carried out throughout the province.

Hunan Province is one of the major rice-producing areas in the country, and the most labor is spent annually on the heavy tasks of transplanting, cultivating, harvesting, and threshing. Therefore, this year, in the reform of tools, all localities are concentrating their efforts on reforming paddy field operation tools and field transportation tools. All localities are giving full play to the superiority of the People's Communes and the technical forces cultivated in the mass iron and steel smelting movement, and are further finalizing and modifying a set of indigenous machinery for paddy field operations that was tested in last year's tool reform movement. This will not only help alleviate the current labor shortage but also open up a new path for the gradual mechanization of paddy fields.

Systematic tool reform work in paddy field operations began last year. Last year, the province promoted more than 4 million paddy field cultivators, averaging about one for every three laborers. More than 940,000 rapid rice harvesters were promoted throughout the province, averaging one for every 20-plus mu of early rice fields. Last year, the province also promoted about 400,000 rice threshing machines and various field transportation tools, as well as some rice transplanters. Currently, most areas of the province have initially established a relatively complete set of indigenous machinery tools for several major operational processes such as rice transplanting, cultivation, harvesting, and threshing. The use of these tools generally increases work efficiency by one to three times compared to manual operation. Last year, the province saved more than 100 million labor days as a result, alleviating the contradiction of labor shortages during the busy seasons of harvesting and planting.

Because all localities have earnestly implemented the policy of "overall planning, completed in stages" proposed by the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in the tool reform, and have adopted the method of "from near to far, from indigenous to foreign, combining the near and far, combining indigenous and foreign," they have not only solved the current difficulties of labor shortage but also created conditions for the mechanization of paddy fields. Among them, the invention of rice transplanters and rapid rice harvesters, in particular, has initially solved two difficult problems in the mechanization of paddy field operations, with extremely significant scientific and practical implications. Last year, the achievements of the paddy field tool reform movement in the province were great, but the development was uneven, and some tools were rushed into production during busy times, resulting in low quality and inconsistent specifications. Therefore, the Party committees at all levels have recently further strengthened their leadership over the tool reform movement and are organizing forces to conduct comprehensive inspections, appraisals, finalizations, modifications, and repairs of the new tools that have been promoted, focusing on the quality of the tools and the training of users, so that the systematic paddy field tool reform can be further consolidated, improved, and perfected.

In establishing a complete set of indigenous machinery tools for paddy fields, all localities not only enthusiastically treat every invention and creation of the masses but also adopt lively new tool evaluation and competition meetings, repeatedly testing and improving in the masses and in practice before finally finalizing and promoting them. For example, the Hengyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, when appraising the rapid rice harvester created by the local masses in August last year, successively convened two district-wide rice harvester evaluation and competition meetings. Finally, among more than 40 kinds of rice harvesters, the multi-purpose rice harvester modified by the Jilong Township Farm Tool Factory of Hengnan County was selected as the best and has been promoted throughout the province after being finalized. Currently, the simple rice transplanter promoted throughout the province was created by He Jisheng, a member of the Qing Shuijiang People's Commune in Liling County and a Communist Party member, in July last year. Last year, they used the rice transplanter to try transplanting 51 mu of late rice, and the general work efficiency was three times higher than manual transplanting.

Experience has shown that organizing roving performances of new tools and "ring competitions" between new and old tools is not only a mass appraisal and test of new tools but also a working method of the mass line to promote the development of the tool reform movement. (Hu Jian)

    集中力量赶造春耕工具
    湖南二十万铁木工提早修制小农具、插秧机
    本报讯　湖南各地在大抓水利、积肥等工具的同时，提早制造和修配春耕所需各种工具。据1月20日统计，全省七千多个农具厂已组织二十多万名铁、木工人，全面整修小农具和制造插秧机。全省已制造简易插秧机两万多部，训练了制造插秧机工人和插秧机手两万多名。现在，插秧机的制造推广工作，正在全省各地开展着。
    湖南省是全国水稻产区之一，每年在插秧、中耕、收割、脱粒等繁重的劳动中，所花费的劳动力最多。因此今年各地在工具改革中，集中力量进行水田操作工具和田间运输工具的改革。各地充分发挥人民公社的优越性和在全民炼钢铁运动中培养出来的技术力量的作用，把去年工具改革运动中试验的一套水田操作土机械，进一步加以定型、改装。这样不仅有利于缓和当前劳力不足的状况，而且为水稻田逐步走向机械化开辟了一条新的道路。
    在水田操作中进行系统的工具改革工作，是从去年开始的。去年全省推广水稻中耕器四百多万部，平均每三个劳动力约有一部。全省推广快速割禾器九十四万多部，平均每二十多亩早稻田有一部。去年全省还推广了约四十万部打稻机和各种田间运输工具以及一部分插秧机。现在全省大部分地区已经在水稻插秧、中耕、收割、脱粒等几个主要操作工序上，初步建立了一套比较完整的土机械工具。使用这些工具，一般较手工操作提高工效一倍到三倍。去年全省因此节约了一亿多个劳动日，缓和了抢收抢种中劳力不足的矛盾。
    由于各地在工具改革中认真贯彻了中共湖南省委提出的“全面规划，分期完成”的方针，采取“由近及远，由土到洋，远近结合，土洋结合”的办法，不仅解决了当前劳力不足的困难，而且为水田机械化创造了条件。其中特别是水稻插秧机和快速割禾器的发明，初步解决了水田操作机械化中两个难题，有着极其重大的科学意义和现实意义。去年全省水田工具改革运动成绩很大，但是发展不平衡，有些工具忙中赶制，质量不高，规格不统一。因此，最近各级党委进一步加强了对工具改革运动的领导，正组织力量，对已推广的新工具，进行全面检查、鉴定、定型、改装和修理，突出地抓住工具质量和训练使用人员工作，使得系统的水田工具改革，进一步巩固、提高和完善。
    在建立成套的水田土机械工具中，各地不仅热情地对待群众的每个发明创造，而且采取生动活泼的新工具评比竞赛大会的方式，在群众中、实践中反复试验、改进，最后才定型推广的。例如，中共衡阳地委在去年8月间鉴定当地群众创造的快速割禾器时，先后召开了两次全区性的割禾器评比竞赛大会。最后在四十多种割禾器中，评选出衡南县鸡笼乡农具厂改制的多用割禾器最好，定型后已在全省推广。目前，全省推广的简易插秧机，是醴陵县清水江人民公社社员、共产党员贺继生在去年7月创造的。去年他们用插秧机已试插五十一亩晚稻，一般工效较人工插秧提高三倍。
    经验证明，组织新工具的巡回表演和新旧工具的“擂台比武”，不仅是新工具的一次群众性的鉴定和考验，而且是推动工具改革运动发展的群众路线的工作方法。（胡坚）
