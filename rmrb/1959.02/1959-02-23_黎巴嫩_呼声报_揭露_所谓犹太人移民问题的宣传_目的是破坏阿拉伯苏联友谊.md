Xinhua News Agency, Beirut Telegram – Lebanese Interior Minister Eddé said on the 19th that he had received no official information whatsoever regarding the so-called large-scale Jewish migration from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to Israel.

Eddé said, when answering a question from an “Al-Hadaf” reporter about whether he could confirm these claims, that he had only seen such news in certain newspapers.

Recently, the UAR's "Al-Ahram" and "Al-Gomhouria," Damascus' "Al-Khabar," and some Lebanese newspapers have been vigorously publicizing the so-called large-scale Jewish migration from the Soviet Union and some socialist countries in Eastern Europe to Israel, and have successively published commentaries attacking it. "Al-Ahram" publicized that the migration of Jews from Eastern European countries to Israel was "carried out according to the secret resolutions of the World Zionist Congress representatives." "Al-Khabar" said that the large-scale exodus of Jews from Eastern European countries is "the biggest danger in the Middle East." Damascus' "Al-Youm" attacked, saying that "the main purpose behind this migration is to deliberately strike a planned blow against the Arabs and their just cause."

"Al-Hadaf" also published an editorial on the 19th, saying, "Soviet-Arab friendship is the main condition for defending the achievements of Arab nationalism."

The newspaper pointed out that U.S. imperialism is desperately trying to shake the foundations of Arab-Soviet friendship and is isolating Arab nationalism internationally, "in order to provide Americans with an opportunity, as they are malevolently waiting for a chance to strike at the Arab liberation movement."

The newspaper pointed out that it is worth noting that imperialism intends to use Arab hands to realize its conspiracy. The newspaper said, "Heikal (editor-in-chief of "Al-Ahram") and others who cheer for imperialism are largely involved in disrupting Arab-Soviet friendship." The newspaper said, "The propaganda campaign regarding the so-called Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union to Israel is merely part of a larger movement organized by imperialists and their agents against the Soviet Union."

The newspaper said that the U.S. intention to shake Arab-Soviet friendship arose from a time "when the Arabs, through their own experience, saw that their friendship with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries was the source of strength for Arab countries and a source of constructive support for their national economies." "Al-Hadaf" said, "Egypt's dozens of industrial construction projects, the first stage of construction of the High Dam, Syria's nineteen projects, Yemen's many construction projects, and the Soviet Union's decisive attitude in upholding Arab affairs internationally, all of this terrified U.S. imperialism to the point of madness, because it saw how the unparalleled Soviet aid and assistance universally generated an irresistible and profound love for the Soviet Union throughout the Arab world."

The newspaper also pointed out that the United States is also inciting Iran to attack Iraq. The newspaper reminded the Arabs that this is part of an anti-communist "crusade" launched against Syria and Iraq, the purpose of which is to allow American forces to enter the region.

### 黎巴嫩“呼声报”揭露  所谓犹太人移民问题的宣传  目的是破坏阿拉伯苏联友谊

    黎巴嫩“呼声报”揭露
    所谓犹太人移民问题的宣传
    目的是破坏阿拉伯苏联友谊
    据新华社贝鲁特电　黎巴嫩内政部长埃迪在19日说，他丝毫没有获得关于所谓犹太人从苏联和其它社会主义国家大规模移往以色列的正式消息。
    埃迪在回答“呼声报”记者向他提出的能否证实这些说法的问题时说，他只是从某些报纸上看到这样的消息。
    最近阿联的“金字塔报”和“共和国报”、大马士革“消息报”等以及黎巴嫩的一些报纸大肆宣传所谓犹太人从苏联和东欧的一些社会主义国家大规模向以色列迁移，并纷纷发表评论进行攻击。“金字塔报”宣传说：东欧国家犹太人向以色列迁移是“按照世界犹太复国主义大会代表的秘密决议进行的”。“消息报”说，犹太人大规模地从东欧国家迁出是“中东最大的危险”。大马士革的“今天报”攻击说，“这种迁移后面的主要目的是故意给阿拉伯人以及他们的正义事业以有计划的打击”。
      “呼声报”在19日还发表社论说，“苏联—阿拉伯友谊是保卫阿拉伯民族主义成就的主要条件。”
    这家报纸指出，美帝国主义在拼命动摇阿拉伯—苏联友谊的基础，并且在国际上孤立阿拉伯民族主义，“以便给美国人提供机会，他们正在存心不良地伺机来打击阿拉伯解放运动”。
    这家报纸指出，值得注意的是，帝国主义打算用阿拉伯的手来实现它的阴谋。这家报纸说，“海卡尔（“金字塔报”主编）和为帝国主义助威的其他人正在很大程度上参与扰乱阿拉伯—苏联友谊的工作”。这家报纸说，“关于所谓犹太人从苏联移居以色列的宣传运动，只不过是帝国主义者和他们的代理人正在组织的一个反对苏联的更大的运动的一部分”。
    这家报纸说，美国动摇阿拉伯—苏联友谊的目的是从这样一个时候产生的，“当时阿拉伯人通过自己的经验，看到他们同苏联和其他社会主义国家的友谊是阿拉伯国家力量的源泉，并且是他们的国民经济得到建设性支持的源泉”。“呼声报”说，“埃及的几十项工业建设工程、高水坝第一阶段的建设、叙利亚的十九项工程、也门的许多建设工程，苏联在国际上维护阿拉伯事务方面采取的决定性态度，所有这一切使美帝国主义感到恐惧以致发狂，因为它看到，无可比拟的苏联援助和帮助如何在整个阿拉伯世界普遍地产生了对苏联的不可抗拒的深厚的热爱。”
    这家报纸还指出，美国还在煽动伊朗来攻击伊拉克。这家报纸提醒阿拉伯人说，这是对叙利亚和伊拉克发动的反共“十字军运动”的一部分，它的目的是要使美国势力进入这个地区。
