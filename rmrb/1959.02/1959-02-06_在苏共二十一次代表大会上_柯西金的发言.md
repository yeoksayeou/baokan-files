Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 28th (TASS): CPSU Central Committee Presidium Alternate Member Kosygin delivered a speech at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the morning of January 28.

Kosygin said that only three years have passed since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, but this short period is of great significance in the history of our party and our country. Thanks to the correct leadership of the party's fighting headquarters—the Leninist Central Committee—the gigantic task of boosting the national economy has been resolved, a fundamental reorganization of the management of industry and construction has been carried out, extremely important measures have been implemented to further develop the collective farm system, and a huge increase in the material welfare of the people has been guaranteed. The Soviet Union has entered a period of comprehensively unfolding communist construction.

The foreign policy of peaceful coexistence pursued by our party, and the Soviet state's active struggle to consolidate peace and friendship between all peoples, have achieved remarkable results. The international prestige of the Soviet Union has been further enhanced. The socialist camp has become stronger and more united.

The Central Committee solemnly defended the unity of the party, and timely crushed the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin and Shepilov, who attempted to lead the party away from the Leninist path. After clearing out this factional splitters, our party became more united and combat-effective.

He said that the 21st Congress of the CPSU is discussing a great program for building a communist society. Seven years is not a long time, but these seven years are of decisive significance for realizing the Soviet Union's basic economic task—catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product output.

Comrade Kosygin said that the Party has formulated extensive measures to further improve the material welfare of the Soviet people. The realization of these measures will be the greatest achievement of our social system. Kosygin talked about the problem of increasing the production of consumer goods. He said that our economy is now able to stipulate a higher rate of development for light industry and the food industry in the Seven-Year Plan than in the previous period, while ensuring the priority development of heavy industry. During the Seven-Year Plan, the total investment in the national economy will increase by 80%, while the investment in light industry and the food industry will increase by 200%—212%, which will enable the task of rapidly improving people's living standards to be successfully completed.

The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that the production of consumer goods will increase by approximately 62%—65% compared to the 1958 level. It also stipulates that the variety of consumer goods should be increased, the production of high-quality food, better clothing, and daily necessities that enrich cultural life and make life comfortable should be increased. During the Seven-Year Plan, we will not only catch up with but also exceed the level of the United States in terms of per capita output of a series of major food products. For example, the total production of sugar will almost double, with an average of 41 to 44 kilograms of sugar per person per year, our sugar consumption level will be higher than that of the United States.

Due to the continuous upsurge of animal husbandry, the output of milk and meat in our country is increasing sharply. The output of animal fats will increase by 60% during the Seven-Year Plan, meat will double, and the output of cheese and other dairy products will be greatly increased. Approximately two hundred and fifty new meat processing plants will be put into production.

Fish products occupy an important place in people's food. Before the war, the per capita consumption of fish products in our country was 5 kilograms, now it is 9.5 kilograms, and by 1965 it will increase to 12-13 kilograms, thereby surpassing the current level of fish consumption in the United States. The motorized fleet of the fish processing industry is now 2.6 times larger than before the war. Before the 21st Congress of the CPSU, shipbuilders in the Ukrainian Republic launched a new whaling ship "Soviet Ukraine" with a displacement of 44,000 tons. This is a major achievement of the motherland's shipbuilding industry. In 1965, the amount of fish caught in our country will increase by 60% compared to 1958.

Comrade Kosygin continued, during the Seven-Year Plan, the task of ensuring that Soviet people have ample textiles, clothing, footwear, and other commodities will be solved. At present, the output of cotton and silk fabrics in our country is more than any Western capitalist country except the United States. In terms of the output of woolen and linen fabrics, the Soviet Union ranks first in the world. The Seven-Year Plan stipulates that the output of various textiles should be increased by 40%. In terms of the total output of textiles, we will be much closer to the United States, and the output of woolen fabrics will exceed the current level of the United States by 80%.

The knitwear industry will develop at a very high speed, the production of artificial fur will increase, and the production of clothing, leather, and the footwear industry will also expand.

The plan stipulates that the production of daily-use furniture and machines that reduce women's housework should be doubled.

With the improvement of people's welfare, the demand for various high-quality commodities will increase. The National Economic Committees should seriously and systematically study the work of improving commodity varieties, design new varieties of commodities, and organize the large-scale production of new commodities. Factories must change the varieties of products according to the requirements of trade organizations.

In order to complete the task of expanding the production of consumer goods, the Seven-Year Plan stipulates that the new production capacity of light industry and the food industry should be rapidly increased. More than 1,600 enterprises in these departments must be built.

Comrade Kosygin said that it is necessary to use potential to ensure the completion of the established plan, especially it is necessary to carry out new scientific research, adopt synthetic raw materials in the national economy, use investment most rationally, and further reduce construction costs.

Kosygin concluded by saying that there is no doubt that our working class, collective farmers, intellectuals, and heroic Soviet youth will concentrate all their energy and all their creative power to realize the Party's great plan.

    在苏共二十一次代表大会上
    柯西金的发言
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社莫斯科1月28日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会主席团候补委员柯西金1月28日上午在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会上发了言。
    柯西金说，从苏共第二十次代表大会到现在总共只有三年时间，但是，这一段不长的时期在我们党和我们国家的历史上却具有巨大的意义。由于党的战斗司令部——列宁主义的中央委员会的正确领导，解决了使国民经济高涨的巨大任务，对工业和建筑业的管理进行了根本改组，实现了进一步发展集体农庄制度的极重要的措施，保证了人民物质福利的巨大增进。苏联已经进入全面展开共产主义建设的时期。
    我们党所奉行的和平共处的外交政策，苏维埃国家为巩固和平和各国人民之间的友谊而进行的积极斗争，都取得了卓有成效的结果。苏联的国际威信更加提高了。社会主义阵营更加强大和团结了。
    中央委员会庄严地维护了党的团结，及时地粉碎了企图使党离开列宁主义道路的马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团。我们党在清除了这个派别分裂集团之后，更加团结一致和富有战斗力了。
    他说，苏共第二十一次代表大会正在讨论建设共产主义社会的伟大纲领。七年是一个不长的时间，但是，这七年对实现苏联的基本经济任务——即在按人口平均计算的产品产量方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家——却具有决定性的意义。
    柯西金同志说，党制定了进一步提高苏联人民物质福利的广泛措施。这些措施的实现将是我国社会制度所取得的极伟大的成果。柯西金谈到了增加消费品生产的问题。他说，我国经济现在已经可以在保证优先发展重工业的同时，在七年计划中规定以比前一个时期更高的速度来发展轻工业和食品工业。在七年计划期间，对国民经济的投资额总共将增加80％，而轻工业和食品工业的投资额将增加200％—212％，这将使迅速提高人民生活水平的任务能够胜利完成。
    七年计划规定，消费品的生产将比1958年的水平增长约62％—65％。还规定要增加消费品的品种，增加高质量的食品、更好的服装，增加使文化生活丰富多彩、使生活舒适的日用品的生产。在七年计划期间，我们在一系列主要食品产品的按人口平均计算的产量方面，将不仅赶上而且还将超过美国的水平。例如，糖的总产量差不多将增加一倍，每人每年平均将有四十一到四十四公斤糖，我们的糖的消费水平将比美国高。
    由于畜牧业的不断高涨，我国的奶类和肉类产量正在急剧增长。动物油脂的产量在七年计划期间将增加60％，肉类将增加一倍，干酪和其它奶制品的产量将大大提高。大约有二百五十座新的肉类加工工厂将投入生产。
    鱼类产品在人民的食品中占有重要地位。按人口平均计算，战前我国对鱼类产品的消费量是五公斤，现在是九点五公斤，而到1965年就将增加到十二——十三公斤，从而使我们超过美国目前的鱼类消费水平。鱼类加工工业的机动船队现在比战前增加了二点六倍。在苏共第二十一次代表大会之前，乌克兰共和国的造船工作者使一艘排水量为四万四千吨的新捕鲸船“苏维埃乌克兰号”下水。这是祖国造船业的一项重大成就。1965年，我国的捕鱼量将比1958年增加60％。
    柯西金同志接着说，在七年计划期间，保证苏联人有充裕的纺织品、服装、鞋类和其他商品的任务将得到解决。现在，我国棉织品和丝织品的产量，除美国以外，比任何西方资本主义国家都多。在毛织品和亚麻织品的产量方面，苏联则居世界第一位。七年计划规定把各种纺织品的产量增加40％。在纺织品的总产量方面，我们将大大接近美国，而毛织品的产量将超过美国目前水平80％。
    针织工业将以很高的速度发展，人造毛皮的生产将有所增长，服装生产、皮革和制鞋工业也将扩大。
    计划规定要把日用家具和减轻妇女家务劳动的机器的生产增加一倍。
    随着人民福利的提高，居民对各种高质量商品的需求将增长，各国民经济委员会应该认真地、系统地研究改进商品品种的工作，设计新品种的商品并组织新商品的大规模生产，各工厂必须根据贸易组织的要求来改变产品的品种。
    为了完成扩大消费品生产的任务，七年计划规定迅速增加轻工业和食品工业的新的生产能力。要使这些部门的一千六百多个企业建成。
    柯西金同志说，必须利用潜力以保证完成既定的计划，尤其是必须进行新的科学研究，在国民经济中采用合成原料，最合理地使用投资，进一步降低建筑成本。
    柯西金最后说，毫无疑问，我国的工人阶级、集体农民、知识分子、英雄的苏联青年，定将集中自己的全部精力和一切创造力量，去实现党的伟大计划。
