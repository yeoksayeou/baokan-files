　　Joyfully Celebrate the Spring Festival, Sing Praises of the Great Leap Forward
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 9th: The bountiful fruits of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 have enabled the people of Tianjin to celebrate this year's Spring Festival with even greater joy.

    People put on their new holiday clothes, set off firecrackers, eat reunion dumplings, and joyfully participate in various cultural and recreational activities. Over the past two days, vehicles on Tianjin's main thoroughfares have been running all night. The bustling streets of Quanye Field, Binchang Road, and Heping Road are packed with people. All of the city's fifty-odd cinemas and theaters are showing the latest programs all night long. The China Youth Art Theater and the Experimental Peking Opera Troupe of the China Opera School are performing their signature pieces for Tianjin audiences during these days. On New Year's Eve alone, more than two thousand Spring Festival galas were held throughout the city. Existing cultural palaces, youth palaces, clubs, storytelling theaters, teahouses, and other public places are all brightly decorated. The holiday activities held by the more than one thousand three hundred cultural centers and clubs added last year make this year's Spring Festival even more colorful. Professional and amateur opera actors throughout the city performed more than one thousand five hundred programs on New Year's Eve. Factory auditoriums and clubs have become happy homes for workers during the Spring Festival. The Tianjin Steel Plant's club prepared a rich and varied program of cultural and recreational activities for all of its employees, with more than two hundred and twenty song, dance, and drama programs, more than half of which were created by the workers themselves.

    During the Spring Festival, leading Party and government officials of Hebei Province and Tianjin Municipality celebrated the holiday together with the citizens. Secretaries of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee Secretariat held a joint celebration with workers. Wan Xiaotang, First Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, and others visited and extended their regards to workers recuperating at the workers' sanatorium on New Year's Eve. Many places held joint army-civilian and worker-peasant celebrations.

    The leap forward in production has added to the festive joy and pleasure of the city's working people in both their spiritual and material lives. The family of Wang Yinshan, a combing worker at the Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory who has been elected as a labor model six times, is having a particularly lively Spring Festival this year. Wang Yinshan said that last year's Great Leap Forward made this year's Spring Festival even better. This year is a year of even greater leap forward, and a new technological revolution upsurge has already begun in the factory. After the Spring Festival, he will definitely go all out and achieve a "good start" in production.
