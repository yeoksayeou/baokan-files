How to Understand the Transition to Communism

The Institute of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Guangzhou Philosophical Society, and the Guangdong Economic Society recently held a symposium in Guangzhou to discuss the issue of understanding China's transition from socialism to communism. At the symposium, a focused debate was held on the issue of the starting point of "transition." The basic viewpoints of those who debated were of two types: one believed that the starting point for the transition to communism should be after the completion of socialism, and the other believed that the transition should begin before the completion of socialism.

The arguments of those who held the first view were: 1. Socialism and communism are two stages of different qualities. Transition is a comprehensive qualitative change involving politics, economy, ideology, etc. Only when the new quality occupies a dominant position can a qualitative leap occur. Therefore, the transition to communism must occur after the completion of socialism. The sprouts of communism and the qualitative definition of communism cannot be confused. If it is believed that the presence of communist factors means transition, then that is to believe that quantitative change is transition. 2. The transition to communism must have mature conditions. These conditions are the six conditions put forward in the second section of the "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes," and these six conditions are roughly the same as the conditions for the completion of socialism. Therefore, the transition is after the completion of socialism. 3. Striving to increase communist factors in the process of socialist construction is only to prepare conditions for the future transition to communism and to shorten the time of future transition. The transition to communism as a strategic task can only be put forward after the completion of socialism.

Those who held the second view had three different opinions. The first opinion believed that the transition can begin simultaneously with the socialist construction process, and the reasons are: 1. The socialist stage and the communist stage are not clearly separated, but are mutually infiltrated. The transition to communism can occur in the process of socialist construction. 2. Because world communism has entered a new era, the international situation is particularly favorable to us. It is possible to use favorable conditions to start the transition before the completion of socialism. 3. We have found the best form for the transition to communism - the people's commune. 4. The six conditions stipulated in the Sixth Plenary Session resolution are the conditions for the transition to communism, and these conditions are easier to achieve than the conditions for the completion of socialism. The second opinion believed that the sign of this transition is the transition from socialist collective ownership to ownership by the whole people. The third opinion believed that the realization of the people's commune marks the beginning of the transition from socialism to communism. However, the vast majority of participants disagreed with this view.

In addition to the above views, there is another opinion that if "transition" is understood as the entire process from quantitative change to qualitative change, then it is not unreasonable to advocate starting the transition before the completion of socialism; however, as a revolutionary strategic task for a certain period, the transition to communism can only be put forward after the completion of socialism.

    怎样认识向共产主义过渡的问题
    中国科学院广州分院哲学社会科学研究所、广州哲学会和广东经济学会，最近在广州市联合召开了一次座谈会，讨论了关于我国由社会主义向共产主义过渡的认识问题。在座谈会上就“过渡”的起点问题展开了集中的争论。争论者持的基本观点有两种，一种认为开始向共产主义过渡的起点，应该在建成社会主义之后，一种认为在社会主义建成以前就开始过渡。
    持第一种观点者的论据是：一、社会主义和共产主义是不同质的两个阶段，过渡是包括政治、经济、思想意识等在内的全面的质变，只有在新质占统治地位时，才能发生新质的飞跃，因此向共产主义过渡必须在社会主义建成之后；共产主义的萌芽和共产主义质的规定性不能混为一谈，如果认为有共产主义因素即过渡，那就是认为量变即过渡。二、向共产主义过渡必须条件成熟，这些条件就是“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”第二节中提出的六个条件，而这六条和建成社会主义的条件大致相同，因此过渡是在建成社会主义之后。三、在社会主义建设过程中力求增加共产主义因素，只是为了将来向共产主义过渡准备条件，缩短将来过渡的时间，向共产主义过渡作为战略任务要到社会主义建成后才能提出来。
    持第二种观点的又有三种不同看法。第一种意见认为在社会主义建设过程中同时即可开始过渡，理由是：一、社会主义阶段和共产主义阶段不是截然分开的，而是相互渗透的，在社会主义建设过程中就可向共产主义过渡；二、由于世界共产主义已进入崭新的时代，国际局势对我们特别有利，有可能利用有利条件在社会主义建成前就开始过渡；三、我们已找到了向共产主义过渡的最好形式——人民公社；四、六中全会决议中规定的六个条件就是向共产主义过渡的条件，而这些条件比之社会主义建成的条件还容易实现些。第二种意见认为这一过渡开始的标志就是由社会主义的集体所有制到全民所有制的过渡。第三种意见认为人民公社的实现，即标志着社会主义向共产主义过渡的开始。但绝大部分与会者不同意这种看法。
    除了上述这些看法以外，还有一种意见，认为如果把“过渡”理解为由量变到质变的整个过程，那么主张在社会主义建成前就开始过渡不是没有道理的；但是作为一定时期的革命战略任务来说，向共产主义过渡要到社会主义建成后才能提出来。
