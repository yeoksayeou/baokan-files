　　“Your factory has demonstrated the spirit of communist cooperation in the cause of socialist construction, vigorously supporting our factory in solving the difficulties in the Great Leap Forward. This communist style is a model for us to learn from.”

　　“We extend our highest respects to all the staff and workers who have vigorously supported the construction of our factory.”…………

　　The office of the director of the Beijing Metal Processing Factory, though small, was filled with a red glow from the many brocade banners, making it particularly vibrant.

　　These brocade banners, some from Tianjin, some from Shanxi, though inscribed with simple words, vividly demonstrate that in the Great Leap Forward, the factory's staff and workers, selfless and dedicated, did everything possible to help fifty-nine enterprises urgently needing to start up quickly in the steel, coke, machinery, and other industries to assemble complete sets of equipment, ensuring these enterprises were put into production on schedule and ahead of schedule.

　　The Beijing Metal Processing Factory is a small machinery plant with only a few hundred workers and dozens of old lathes. Last year, their own production tasks were heavy, requiring them to manufacture hundreds of belt conveyors, winches, iron shears, and other equipment. However, the tasks of the newly built and expanded Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, Beijing Steel Plant, Special Steel Plant, and Xuanwu Iron and Steel Plant were even more pressing, requiring the factory's collaboration. Therefore, the workers temporarily put aside their own work and fought with all their might to manufacture steelmaking equipment. After five months of hard work, more than three thousand sets of equipment and parts such as converters, blast furnaces, cupola furnaces, steel ladles, and blowers were manufactured, effectively ensuring the new construction and expansion projects of these several plants were put into production ahead of schedule.

　　In August last year, as the factory's workers were working shifts to manufacture steel ladles for the Beijing Steel Plant, the Xuanwu Iron and Steel Plant requested assistance in manufacturing converters. The factory leaders began to feel very difficult: both were tasks from the “steel commander,” what to do? After understanding the situation, the workers of the Third Workshop resolutely guaranteed to the factory leaders: “Give us the work! Even without eating or sleeping, we will ensure the tasks of the two steel plants are completed on schedule.” Thus, the workers were divided into two groups, one group continued to manufacture steel ladles, and the other group manufactured converters. In the past, the factory's workers had never manufactured converters, and the factory did not have the necessary large equipment. Seeing the one-inch thick steel plates were hard to handle, someone suggested that the Beijing Third General Machinery Plant had a steel rolling machine and could be asked for help. Old worker Pu Ruizhi immediately led more than a dozen young men to the Third General Machinery Plant. Seeing that their machine was busy, their hearts cooled down a bit. Pu Ruizhi and everyone discussed a solution: first help the staff and workers of the Third General Machinery Plant, and then find time to do their own work. Immediately, the area around the steel rolling machine became lively. Some helped transport materials, some transported finished products. They used the time when the workers of the Third General Machinery Plant were eating and sleeping to manufacture converters for the Xuanwu Iron and Steel Plant. After seven days of hard work, the converter was manufactured. At this time, a new problem arose: the Xuanwu Iron and Steel Plant was a newly built plant, and the workers did not know how to install the converter. Other steel plants were even busier and could not spare anyone to help. Li Yuxiang, director of the Third Workshop, personally led more than ten people to the Xuanwu Iron and Steel Plant to help install it.

　　The Beijing Metal Processing Factory not only enthusiastically helped its brother factories in the city, but also vigorously supported the production of brother factories in other places. The People's Commune of Lishan County in Shanxi Province established a coke plant and requested the Beijing Metal Processing Factory to supply them with four winches and hoped to send people to help install them. They immediately sent three people with the winches to help, which rapidly increased the output of the coke plant by four times. In order to help the Yongli Alkali Plant in Tanggu manufacture alkali-making water tanks and boilers, the Beijing Metal Processing Factory sent workshop director Xiao Lin and more than ten skilled workers to the site for processing, and they did not return to Beijing until New Year's Eve.

　　This selfless style of the Beijing Metal Processing Factory has been praised by many factories, and Sun Lianjie, the secretary of the factory's Party branch, humbly said: “In our socialist construction cause, no one can be separated from anyone. Only through everyone’s joint collaboration can we ensure the motherland leaps forward faster.”

    锦旗的来历
    本报记者　张慧贤
    “你厂在社会主义建设事业中发挥了共产主义协作精神，大力支援我厂解决跃进中的困难，这种共产主义风格，是我们学习的榜样。”
    “谨向大力支援我厂建设的全体职工致以崇高的敬礼。”…………
    北京市金属加工厂厂长办公室的屋子虽然很矮小，但室内却被很多锦旗映得一片红光，显得格外有生气。
    这些锦旗，有的来自天津，有的来自山西，锦旗上面虽然只是一些简单的话，但是它生动地表明这个厂职工在大跃进中，舍己为人，千方百计地帮助五十九个急需快速上马的钢铁、焦炭、机械等企业把设备配成套，保证这些企业按期和提前投入了生产。
    北京市金属加工厂是一个仅有几百个工人和几十台破旧车床的小机械厂，去年他们自己的生产任务很重，要制造几百台皮带机床、卷扬机、剪铁机等设备。但是石景山钢铁公司、北京钢厂、特殊钢厂和宣武钢铁厂新建和扩建的任务更紧，要求这个厂协作。于是，工人们就暂时放下了自己手里的活，全力为制造炼钢设备而战斗。苦战五个月，转炉、高炉、冲天炉、钢水包、鼓风机等三千多件配套设备和零件制造出来了，有力地保证了这几个厂的新建和扩建工程提前投入生产。
    去年8月，这个厂工人正连班赶着给北京钢厂制造钢水包，宣武钢铁厂又来要求帮助制造转炉。工厂领导人员开始感到很为难：都是钢帅的任务，怎么办呢？第三车间工人们了解了这个情况以后，坚决向工厂领导保证：“把活给我们吧！不吃饭，不睡觉，也要使两个钢厂的任务按期完成。”于是工人们分成了两个小组，一个组继续制造钢水包，另一组制造转炉。过去，这个厂的工人从来没有制造过转炉，厂里也没有必要的大设备，眼看着一寸厚的大钢板啃不动。有人说，北京市第三通用机械厂有滚钢机，可以去找他们帮助。老工人甫瑞芝就连忙领着十几个小伙子赶到第三通用机械厂。一看人家的机器正忙着呢，心又凉了半截。甫瑞芝和大家商量出一个办法：先帮着第三通用机械厂的职工们干，然后自己再抽空子。顿时，滚钢机周围活跃起来了，有的帮着运料，有的运成品，他们利用第三通用机械厂工人吃饭、睡觉的空闲时间，为宣武钢铁厂制造转炉。经过七天苦战，转炉制造好了。这时，又遇到了新问题：宣武钢铁厂是新建厂，工人们不会安装转炉，别的钢厂更忙，根本抽不出人来帮忙。第三车间主任李玉祥亲自带着十多个人来到宣武钢铁厂帮助安装起来。
    北京市金属加工厂不仅热情地帮助本市各兄弟工厂，而且也大力支援外地兄弟工厂的生产。山西省离山县人民公社建立了一个焦炭厂，要求北京市金属加工厂供给他们四台卷扬机，并希望派人去帮助安装起来。他们立刻派三个人带着卷扬机去帮忙，使这个焦炭厂的产量迅速提高了四倍。为了帮助塘沽永利沽厂制造制碱的水槽和锅，北京市金属加工厂派车间主任萧林和十多个技术高的工人到现场加工，直到除夕，他们才回到北京。
    北京市金属加工厂这种舍己为人的风格，受到许多工厂的赞扬，而这个工厂的党支部书记孙廉洁却谦虚地说：“在我们的社会主义建设事业中，谁也不能离开谁，只有大家共同协作，才能保证祖国更快地跃进。”
