According to the Changjiang Daily: Wuchang Preschool Teachers College in Hubei Province has been concentrating labor time to organize all teachers and students to go to the countryside to labor and assist farmers in running kindergartens, and has gained a lot. Through labor training, they established a labor perspective and the idea of serving the working people; through the practice of preschool education, they corrected the problems of teaching being divorced from politics, production, and reality.

Since more than 700 teachers and students from this school went to the countryside in November last year, they have been engaged in production with farmers, accumulating more than 16,000 workdays. The teachers and students learned more than 80 kinds of farm work. While working, the teachers and students established and guided 1,083 kindergartens in 39 counties including Hongan, Macheng, Dangyang, and Yichang, and opened 305 short-term training courses, training 13,641 childcare workers, greatly promoting the development of rural preschool education. In this process, teachers and students also carried out debates on educational policy, continuously improving their understanding of preschool education and its content.

This period of labor training and preschool education practice has greatly improved the students' awareness and further consolidated their professional ideology. Because, from actual productive labor, they criticized the bourgeois ideas of considering themselves "wasting talent" in preschool education and dividing labor into grades. Through on-site kindergarten operation, they saw the role of preschool education in liberating women's labor and cultivating a new generation, which made them love their profession even more. Cha Guixiang, a woman from Yingcheng County, has five children and could not go to work before; after the children entered the kindergarten, she happily went to the fields and was rated as a labor model. These examples educated the students, causing them to abandon personal plans and obey the needs of the motherland. Many students expressed their willingness to serve the children of the working people for life and to dedicate all their strength to cultivating communist successors. When running kindergartens, they not only taught but also washed feces, urine, and hair for the children. When taking care of the children at night, they also took the time to mend clothes and sew buttons for them. The students who went to Yingcheng took out their own quilts for the children to nap on, and the students who went to Dangyang tore their new towel blankets into small handkerchiefs for the children to wash their faces. On rainy days, the students carried the children home one by one on their backs.

When the teachers and students started running kindergartens, they pursued standardization, moved the urban model, and talked about conditions and equipment. When running training courses, they also tried to apply terminology and dogma, such as talking about the establishment of kindergartens, dividing into caregivers, educators, etc. Their empty theories divorced from reality were quickly corrected by the facts, replaced by combining with the reality of the countryside to organize children to carry out various activities. For example, when they first arrived in the countryside, they taught the children to play "house." But after playing again and again, the children were always not interested, and they failed many times. Later, after analyzing the reasons, they realized that "house" is a game that urban children are more familiar with, and rural children have not seen it, so they don't like it. Later, they compiled new things in the countryside, such as the big canteen and winter sowing, into recreational programs for the children to play. In this way, not only did the children like to play, and played very successfully, but also because these contents were usually seen by the children, they were also expressed very realistically. Another time, they told the children the story of "Masha and the White Bear," and the children did not understand what a white bear was, nor did they understand that Masha was the name of a child, and they were not interested in the story. Later, they changed their methods and told stories about the things around them, and everyone listened with interest. Teachers now fully realize that if teaching materials are divorced from reality, they must be cut, deleted, and supplemented. Now all subjects have boldly, actively, and cautiously carried out teaching material reforms. For example, the fine arts course has increased the teaching content of art fonts and the teaching hours of toy making, and made toy making face the countryside and face production. For example, the music course combined music theory and singing, the physical education course increased dance and games, and the biology course, combined with the actual situation of the kindergarten, adapted the teaching materials. In terms of pedagogy, the school has summarized nine experiences, and teachers and students are preparing to compile pre-school pedagogy based on these experiences as a gift to the National Day.

    武昌幼儿师范七百多名师生深入农村
    同农民一起劳动　和孩子一块生活
    既巩固了专业思想，又推动了幼儿教育事业的发展
    据长江日报消息：湖北省武昌幼儿师范集中使用劳动时间，组织全校师生下乡劳动并协助农民办幼儿园，收获很大。他们通过劳动锻炼，树立了劳动观点和为劳动人民服务的思想；通过幼儿教育的实践，纠正了教学中脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际的毛病。
    这个学校的师生七百多人从去年11月下放农村后，和农民一起下地生产，师生一共做了一万六千多个劳动日，学会了八十多种农活。师生们一边劳动，一边在红安、麻城、当阳、宜昌等三十九个县创办和辅导了一千零八十三个幼儿园，开办了三百零五期短训班，培养了一万三千六百四十一名保教人员，大大推动了农村幼儿教育事业的发展。在这个过程中，师生还开展了教育方针的辩论，使师生对幼儿教育事业、幼儿教育内容的认识不断提高。
    通过这一段劳动锻炼和幼儿教育实践，使学生的觉悟大大提高，进一步巩固了专业思想。因为她们从实际生产劳动中，批判了过去那些认为自己从事幼儿教育事业是
  “大才小用”，以及把劳动分成等级等资产阶级思想。通过实地办园，使她们看到了幼儿教育事业对解放妇女劳动力、培养新的一代所起的作用，更使她们热爱自己的专业。应城县妇女查桂香，有五个孩子，以前不能出工生产；孩子入园以后，她愉快地走向田间，被评为劳动模范。这些事例教育了同学们，使她们开始丢掉个人打算，服从祖国需要。许多同学都表示愿意终身侍候劳动人民的子女，愿意为培养共产主义的接班人献出一切力量。在办园的时候，他们不仅管教，而且替孩子们洗屎、洗尿、洗头。值夜班照料孩子睡觉的时候，她们还抽空替孩子们补衣服、钉扣子。下到应城的同学们，拿出自己的被子给孩子们午睡，下到当阳的同学把自己的新毛巾毯撕成小手巾，替孩子们洗脸。下雨天，同学们还把孩子一个个地背着送回家。
    师生们开始办园的时候，追求正规化，搬用城市的一套，讲条件，讲设备。在办训练班的时候，也是尽搬名词和教条，如讲幼儿园编制，分什么保育员、教养员等。他们这些脱离实际的空头理论很快就被事实纠正了，代之以结合农村的实际，组织儿童们进行各种活动。比如，她们刚到农村时，教孩子们玩“娃娃家”。可是玩来玩去孩子们老是不感兴趣，玩了好多次都失败了。后来分析原因，才知道
  “娃娃家”是城市孩子比较熟悉的游戏，农村孩子没有看见过，所以不喜欢。后来，她们就把农村中的新鲜事物，像大食堂、冬播等编成游艺节目，让孩子们玩。这样，不仅孩子们喜欢玩，玩得很成功，而且，因为这些内容都是孩子们平时看到过的，所以，表现得也很真实。还有一次，她们向孩子们讲“玛沙和白熊”的故事，孩子们听来听去也不懂白熊是什么东西，也不明白玛沙就是小孩的名字，对故事更是不感兴趣。后来，她们改变了方法，把周围的事情编成故事在讲，大家听得就上劲了。教师现也充分认识到：教材脱离实际，就必须砍、删、补。现在各科都大胆、积极而又慎重地进行了教材改革。如美工科增加了美术字的教学内容和玩具制作的教学时数，并且使玩具制作面向农村、面向生产。如音乐科合并了乐理和唱歌，体育科增加了舞蹈和游戏，生物科则结合幼儿园的实际，改编了教材。在教育学方面，全校已总结出九项经验，师生准备根据这些经验合编学前教育学，向国庆献礼。
