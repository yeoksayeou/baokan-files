Xin Zhi Coal Mine Mobilizes the Masses to Engage in Technical Revolution
Produce More Coking Coal, Use Less Manpower

(Our dispatch) Xin Zhi Coal Mine in Shanxi Province, through mobilizing the staff and workers in a mass debate, has found a good way to produce more coking coal and use less manpower.

Xin Zhi Coal Mine is a small coal mine built in 1956 using local methods, rich in coking coal. In order to meet the urgent need of the steel industry for coking coal, the state has assigned the mine production and capital construction tasks this year that are more than four times higher than in 1958; among them, the coking coal production task is 700,000 tons, an increase of more than two times compared with the actual output in 1958. In the process of discussing the completion and over-fulfillment of this plan, the mine's staff and workers first encountered the problem of insufficient labor. There were two opinions on how to solve the labor shortage: one was that the task increased several times, and the number of workers must also increase several times; the other opinion was that although it is necessary to appropriately increase some workers this year, we should first tap internal potential, greatly increase labor productivity, and try to ask for as few people from outside as possible. In order to unify thinking, the General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of China at Xin Zhi Coal Mine launched all mine staff and workers to conduct a vigorous debate centered on "How can we better solve the problem of labor shortage?" The debate was lively and vivid. The workers themselves raised many questions, such as "How many people's work can one person do this year compared to last year? How many days' work can one day do this year compared to last year? How to combine practical work, hard work, and clever work? How to comprehensively carry out the technical revolution?" and launched heated discussions anytime and anywhere. The transportation workers asked the coal mining workers: "How many people's coal are you mining this year compared to last year?" The coal mining workers said: "We are promoting short-wall mining, and one person mines five people's coal this year compared to last year." The coal mining workers asked the transportation workers again: "How many days' work are you doing in one day this year compared to last year?" The transportation workers said: "We use mine cars instead of small flat cars, and use wooden mine cars and wooden tracks to ensure that we transport as much as you mine, and we will also spare people to support coal mining!" In this way, a competition was launched among various work types, production teams, and groups to compare indicators, compare labor savings, compare technical innovation measures, and compare practical work, hard work, and clever work. After comprehensive balancing, the entire mine formulated a specific plan for vigorously carrying out technical revolution and adjusting labor organization. According to this plan, this year the entire mine can save more than 1,600 workers (accounting for 51% of the existing workers) from the original 3,100 workers, and the labor efficiency of the entire mine can be doubled compared to last year.

The plan of Xin Zhi Coal Mine to vigorously carry out technical revolution and double labor productivity is both specific and detailed, and advanced and reliable. The specific method is "three wants" and "three highs" and "four combinations." "Three wants": First, we want labor from improving tools and equipment and making full use of existing technical equipment. Workers and technicians have proposed technical innovation measures for every production link from mine opening to loading coal onto trains. According to the realistic possibilities and technical development direction, they first promoted short-wall retreat mining and rapid tunneling in coal mining, and in transportation, they replaced manual flat cars with mine car transportation, so that manual labor moved towards semi-mechanized production. To this end, on the one hand, it is necessary to make full use of existing mechanical equipment, such as shortening the turnaround time of existing mine cars by more than half; at the same time, it is necessary to use saved pit wood and other wood to manufacture wooden mine cars, wooden tracks, animal-powered winches, bamboo curtain coal loaders, etc. This can increase coal mining and transportation efficiency by more than one and a half times, save more than 1,000 workers, and form these people into new coal mining teams to greatly increase production. Second, we want labor from improving labor organization. Under the principle of strengthening production connection and coordination, we conditionally implement the integration of coal mining and transportation, the integration of mechanics and fitters, and the integration of loading and unloading, promote comprehensive work teams, learn to be versatile, and fundamentally overcome idle work and waste. This can save more than 500 people. Third, we want labor from rapidly improving the technical level of new workers. Now new workers account for three-quarters of the total number of workers. It is necessary to use various forms such as "old leading the new, doing leading the work," contracting teaching and learning, and large performances, large competitions, and large reviews, so that new workers can reach the operating technical level of third- to fourth-grade workers within one year. This is an extremely important task in improving tools and equipment, making full use of machinery and equipment, and improving labor, and it is also an important link in doubling labor productivity. The new workers of Xin Zhi Coal Mine launched a upsurge in learning and mastering technology in this debate, and generally signed teaching contracts with old workers and technical cadres.

In order to realize the "three wants," the Party General Branch of Xin Zhi Coal Mine also loudly proposed the method of combining leaders and the masses, workers and engineers and technicians, new workers and old workers, and local methods and foreign methods in the technical revolution, according to the opinions of the masses. The workers in the repair shop should use the method of hens laying eggs to equip themselves, and they should also supply the coal mining and transportation teams with some tools and equipment for repairing machines and tools, so that the workers who use tools and machines also learn to repair and manufacture.

On the basis of these "three wants" and "four combinations," we will achieve a high degree of mechanization, high output, and high efficiency. Without increasing the number of workers, the daily output of Xin Zhi Coal Mine will increase from more than 600 tons last year to about 2,000 tons. After discussion by the workers, the mine plans to produce 850,000 tons of coking coal this year, an increase of 150,000 tons over the state plan, and three times higher than the actual output last year.

In late January, the technical revolution movement in the entire mine was launched vigorously, and the production level rose in a straight line. The highest daily output has reached more than 1,500 tons, an increase of more than double the average daily output last year. (Attached picture)

Recently, the Shenyang United Brick and Tile Factory built more than 100 local coking ovens. The 40 local ovens that have been put into production have produced more than 800 tons of coke, supplying Shenyang Steel Plant, Foundry, Heavy Machinery Plant, and more than a dozen other units for steelmaking.

    辛置煤矿发动群众大搞技术革命
    多产焦煤　少用人力
    本报讯　山西省辛置煤矿通过发动职工群众大辩论，找到多产焦煤、少用人力的好门路。
    辛置煤矿是1956年用土办法建设起来的一个规模不大的煤矿，盛产焦煤。为了满足钢铁工业对于焦煤的迫切需要，今年国家下达给这个煤矿的生产和基建任务都比1958年增加了四倍多；其中焦煤产量任务是七十万吨，比1958年实际产量提高了两倍多。这个煤矿的职工在讨论完成和超额完成这个计划的过程中，首先碰到的是劳动力不足的问题。对于解决劳力不足问题又有两种意见：一种是任务增加几倍，工人也必须增加几倍；另一种意见认为今年虽然需要适当增加一些工人，但应当首先挖掘内部潜力，大大提高劳动生产率，尽可能少向外边要人。为了统一思想，中共辛置煤矿总支委员会，发动全矿职工以“怎样才能更好地解决劳动力不足的问题”为中心开展了鸣放辩论。鸣放辩论有声有色、生动活泼。工人们自己提出了“今年一个人能干去年几个人的活？今年一天能干去年几天的活？实干苦干巧干怎样结合？怎样全面开展技术革命？”等许多问题，并且随时随地展开热烈讨论。运搬工人问采煤工人：“你们今年一个人采去年几个人的煤？”采煤工人说：“我们推行短壁采煤，今年一个人采去年五个人的煤。”采煤工人又问运搬工人：“你们今年一天干去年几天的活？”运搬工人说：“我们用矿车代替小平车，用木矿车木轨道，保证你们采多少我们运多少，而且还要抽出人支援采煤呢！”这样各个工种各个生产队、组之间在辩论中掀起了比指标，比节约人力，比技术革新措施，比实干苦干巧干的竞赛。全矿经过综合平衡，制订出大搞技术革命、调整劳动组织的具体方案。按照这个方案，今年全矿可以从原有的三千一百多名工人中节约出一千六百多名工人（占现有工人的51％），全矿的劳动效率可比去年翻一番。
    辛置煤矿大搞技术革命，成倍地提高劳动生产率的规划，既具体细致、又先进可靠。具体做法是“三要”、“三高”、“四结合”。“三要”首先是从改进工具设备和充分利用现有技术设备中要劳动力。工人和技术人员，对于由矿井开凿直到把煤炭装上火车的每一个生产环节，都提出了技术革新措施。他们根据现实的可能和技术发展方向，在采煤方面首先推行短壁回采，快速掘进，在运输方面，以矿车运输代替人拉小平车，使手工劳动走上半机械化生产。为此，一方面要充分利用现有机械设备，比如把现有矿车周转时间缩短一半以上；同时要利用节约的坑木和其他木料，自己动手制造木质矿车、木质轨道、畜力绞车、竹帘装煤机等，这样可以使采煤和运输效率提高一倍半以上，节约出一千多名工人，并把这些人组成新的采煤队，大量增加生产。其次是从改善劳动组织中要劳动力。在加强生产衔接配合的原则下，有条件地实行采煤运输合一、机工和钳工合一、装卸合一，推行综合工作队，学做多面手，从根本上克服窝工浪费。这样能够节约五百多人。第三是从迅速提高新工人的技术水平中要劳动力。现在新工人占工人总数的四分之三。要通过“以老带新，以干带工”包教包学和大表演、大比赛、大检阅等各种形式，使新工人在一年内达到三级至四级工人的操作技术水平。这是改进工具设备，充分利用机器设备，改善劳动中一项极为重要的工作，也是成倍提高劳动生产率的一个重要环节。辛置煤矿的新工人在这次鸣放辩论中掀起了一个学习掌握技术的热潮，普遍和老工人、技术干部订立了教学合同。
    为了实现“三要”，辛置煤矿党总支又根据群众鸣放的意见，响亮地提出了在技术革命中实行领导和群众、工人和工程技术人员、新工人和老工人、土办法和洋办法四大结合的办法。修配车间的工人要用母鸡下蛋的办法，自己装备自己，并要给采煤、运输队供应一些修理机器、工具的工具和设备，让使用工具机器的工人也学会修理、学会制造。
    在这“三要”、“四结合”的基础上达到机械化程度高、产量高、效率高。在不增加工人的条件下，辛置煤矿的日产量将由去年的六百多吨，提高到两千吨左右。经过工人讨论，这个矿今年要生产焦煤八十五万吨，比国家计划又增加了十五万吨，比去年实际产量提高了三倍。
    1月下旬，全矿的技术革命运动轰轰烈烈地开展起来，生产水平直线上升，最高日产量已经达到一千五百多吨，比去年平均日产量提高了一倍多。（附图片）
