    Speedily Arm Simple Coke Ovens
    First Batch of 2,000 Sets of Equipment Completed as Scheduled
    (Our report) After the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the First Ministry of Machine Building jointly deployed the urgent task of crash manufacturing equipment for the Red Flag No. 2 simple coke oven on January 19th, workers from ten key electromechanical repair and manufacturing plants under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Shenyang Cable Factory and Dalian Motor Factory under the First Ministry of Machine Building, and the metallurgical bureaus of relevant provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, worked hard and skillfully. In the past twenty-five days, they have basically completed two thousand sets of simple coke oven equipment. The timely completion of this first batch of simple coke oven equipment provides favorable conditions for producing 18 million tons of steel this year.
    According to statistics from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry on February 15th, based on telephone reports from various locations, the completed equipment includes: 2,071 water pumps, 2,008 water pump motors, 2,081 blowers, and 1,676 blower motors, totaling 7,836 units. Among them, 6,173 units were completed by the ten key enterprises under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. Currently, this batch of equipment is being sent to various parts of the country to meet the needs of furnace construction.
    The time for manufacturing this coke oven equipment was extremely tight. Under the leadership of the Party committees in various places, the workers of each unit were urgently mobilized and launched enthusiastic production competitions. The workers in Anshan Iron and Steel Electrical Repair Factory, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Power Plant, Hengyang Metallurgical Machinery Repair and Manufacturing Factory, and other units responsible for manufacturing this batch of equipment recognized the significance of "one day of hard work, ten thousand years of happiness" and voluntarily gave up their Spring Festival holidays. Anshan Iron and Steel, Hengyang, and other electromechanical repair and manufacturing departments also specially manufactured centrifugal casting machines, silicon steel sheet burr removing machines, and other special equipment, and improved production processes, greatly improving production efficiency. Various brother factories closely cooperated and supported each other. In addition to promptly supplying a large number of single yarn enameled wires to various places, the Shenyang Cable Factory and Dalian Motor Factory under the First Ministry of Machine Building also rushed to produce 1,000 motors. All of this effectively guaranteed the completion of the manufacturing task of 2,000 sets of coke oven equipment.
    The second batch of equipment for the Red Flag No. 2 simple coke oven is mainly manufactured by the metallurgical bureaus and machinery bureaus of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. At present, some areas are acting relatively slowly and should catch up quickly to ensure timely completion of tasks.

    火速武装简易焦炉
    首批两千套设备如期制成
    本报讯　冶金工业部和第一机械工业部在1月19日共同布置
  了突击制造红旗二号简易炼焦炉设备的紧急任务以后，冶金部所属十个重点机电修造厂，一机部所属沈阳电缆厂、大连电机厂和各有关省、市、自治区冶金局的职工苦干巧干，在最近二十五天内已经基本上完成了二千套简易焦炉设备。这第一批简易焦炉设备的如期完成，为今年生产一千八百万吨钢提供了有利条件。
    据冶金部15日根据各地电话汇报的统计，已完成的设备有：水泵二千零七十一台，水泵电机二千零八台，鼓风机二千零八十一台，鼓风机电机一千六百七十六台，以上合计共七千八百三十六台；其中由冶金部所属十个重点企业完成的共六千一百七十三台。目前，这批设备正发往全国各地，供应建炉的需要。
    这次制造焦炉设备的时间非常紧迫。在各地党委的领导下，各单位职工紧急动员，开展了热烈的生产竞赛。鞍钢电修厂、太钢动力厂、衡阳冶金机械修造厂等负责制造这批设备的职工认识到“一日辛苦，万年幸福”的意义，自动放弃了春节休假。鞍钢、衡阳等机电修造部门还专门制造了离心浇注机、矽钢片打毛刺机等专用设备，并且改进了生产工艺，使生产效率大大提高。各兄弟厂之间紧密协作，互相支援。一机部沈阳电缆厂和大连电机厂除及时供应各地大量单纱漆包线外，还赶制了一千台电动机。这都有效地保证了二千套焦炉设备制造任务的完成。
    红旗二号简易焦炉的第二批设备，主要由各省、市、自治区的冶金局和机械局负责制造。目前，有的地区行动比较迟缓，应该急起直追，保证按时完成任务。
