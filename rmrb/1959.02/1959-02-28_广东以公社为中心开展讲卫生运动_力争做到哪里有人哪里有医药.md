Guangdong Province's health departments have decided to focus on improving the health work of the People's Communes this year. Through the People's Communes, they will launch a campaign to eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene, and eradicate diseases, thereby driving comprehensive leaps forward in all health undertakings across the province.

The province has decided that this spring, in conjunction with the rectification work of the People's Communes, it will conduct an adjustment and rectification of the health and healthcare institutions at all levels of the communes, and gradually delegate the health and healthcare institutions above the county level to the unified leadership and management of the communes. Larger communes should establish central hospitals, production areas should establish health centers, brigades should establish health clinics and maternity homes, teams should be equipped with health workers, childcare workers, and midwives, so as to ensure that wherever there are people, there is medicine. At the same time, the province will also take the commune as the center to mobilize the masses to continue to carry out the movement to eliminate pests and diseases and promote hygiene.

Another important measure taken by Guangdong Province to improve the health work of the People's Communes is to earnestly improve the hygiene and health care work of the communes' kindergartens, nurseries, public canteens, and homes for the elderly, as well as to improve the communes' women's health care and labor protection work. In addition to conducting extensive and in-depth publicity and education on children's health knowledge and food hygiene knowledge to the masses, health departments at all levels will cooperate with women's federations and education departments to train a large number of childcare workers, and regularly train cooks and staff in public canteens. Regarding women's health care and labor protection, on the basis of the universal establishment of maternity hospitals and maternal and child health stations, the quality of new-method delivery will be improved, prenatal and postnatal examinations will be universally implemented, infant tetanus and puerperal fever will be completely eliminated, and appropriate care will be given to women during menstruation, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. In addition, efforts will be made to train health cadres for the communes. Medical and health schools at all levels and county health care institutions should train medical personnel for the communes. Each commune's health center will run primary health schools or short-term training courses to train a large number of primary health cadres or health workers and midwives.

Vigorously developing the production, collection, and purchase of Chinese medicinal materials is also an important task related to the health work of the People's Communes in Guangdong Province. The province plans to cultivate 700,000 to 1 million mu of medicinal herbs this year. Each special district and county will organize experienced herbal medicine farmers and workers to return to their posts and establish medicinal herb farms as bases for technical guidance. Each commune will set up a specialized team for the production of Chinese medicinal materials to plant medicinal herbs, develop medicinal material production, and seize the season to organize the masses to go to the mountains to collect Chinese medicinal materials.

In order to improve the health work of the People's Communes, the Guangdong Provincial Health Department organized more than 4,000 medical workers and teachers and students from medical schools to go to the countryside for three months at the end of last month to support the medical and health work of the People's Communes.

    广东以公社为中心开展讲卫生运动
    力争做到哪里有人哪里有医药
    本报讯　广东省各级卫生部门决定今年以搞好人民公社卫生工作为工作重点，通过人民公社开展除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病运动，带动全省各项卫生事业全面跃进。
    全省决定在今年春季结合人民公社的整顿工作，对公社各级卫生保健机构进行一次调整和整顿，将县以上一级的卫生保健机构逐步下放给公社统一领导和管理。规模比较大的公社要设立中心卫生院，生产区设卫生院，大队设卫生所及产院，中队设卫生站，小队配备保健员、保育员、接生员；规模较小的公社设卫生院，生产区设卫生所及产院，大队设卫生站，中、小队配备保健员、保育员、接生员，做到哪里有人，哪里有医，哪里有药。同时，全省还将以公社为中心，发动群众继续开展除害灭病讲卫生运动。
    广东省做好人民公社卫生工作的另一项重要措施，是认真做好公社的幼儿园、托儿所、公共食堂和敬老院的卫生保健工作，做好公社的妇女保健及劳动保护工作。除了广泛深入地向群众开展儿童卫生常识和饮食卫生常识的宣传教育外，各级卫生部门将要和妇联、教育部门合作大量训练保育人员，并定期训练公共食堂的炊事员和工作人员。关于妇女的保健和劳动保护方面，将在普遍建立产院、妇幼保健站的基础上，提高新法接生的质量，普遍实行产前产后检查，彻底消灭婴儿破伤风和产褥热，对经、孕、哺乳妇女注意给以适当的照顾。此外，还要大力培养公社的卫生干部。各级医药卫生学校和县卫生保健机构都要为公社培养医务人员，每个公社的卫生院将举办初级卫生学校或短期训练班，大量培养初级的卫生干部或保健员、接生员。
    大力开展中药材的生产、采挖、收购工作，也是广东省人民公社有关卫生工作的一项重要任务。全省今年计划培植药材七十万亩到一百万亩。每个专区每个县将组织老药农、老药工归队，举办药材农场作为技术指导的基地。每个公社设立中药材生产专业队，种植中药材，发展药材生产，并抓住季节组织群众上山采挖中药。
    为了做好人民公社的卫生工作，广东省卫生厅上月底已经组织了四千多医务工作人员和医药学校的教师、学生下乡三个月，支援人民公社的医疗卫生工作。
