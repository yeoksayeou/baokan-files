    The Cameroon People's Union
    The Cameroon People's Union is the largest national political organization in Cameroon, founded in April 1948. The General Secretary of the Union was Niobé (who was recently brutally murdered by French colonialists); the Chairman is Moumié. From its inception, the Cameroon People's Union has adhered to a fighting slogan: "National Unity – Independence." It has waged unremitting struggles for unity and independence, for improving people's living standards, and against forced labor, racial discrimination, and the seizure of land. It enjoys high prestige among the Cameroonian people.
    In early 1955, the movement for unity and independence in Cameroon surged to new heights, and an unprecedented general strike broke out across the country. On April 22, the various parties led by the Cameroon People's Union issued a joint declaration demanding an end to the "trusteeship" system and the establishment of a sovereign Cameroonian state. However, the French colonialists carried out bloody suppression against the Cameroonian people, with tens of thousands of people killed and arrested, and the People's Union suffered great losses. On July 13, 1956, fearing the growing strength of the people, the French colonialists blatantly promulgated a decree banning the Cameroon People's Union and other nationalist organizations. However, the struggle of the Cameroonian people did not stop, and the Cameroon People's Union went underground. Soon, under the leadership of the Cameroon People's Union, the Cameroonian people began armed struggles in the jungles of Sanaga and Malindinle. This struggle is gradually expanding.
    Meanwhile, the Cameroon People's Union office, led by Chairman Moumié and others who were forced into exile abroad, was established in Cairo in 1957. They actively campaigned for independence and for the support of peace-loving people from all countries for the Cameroonian people. At the end of December 1957, Moumié, Chairman of the Cameroon People's Union, led a delegation to the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, where he delivered a report on colonialism, resolutely condemning colonialism for enslaving and exploiting the people of African countries. In April 1958, representatives of the Cameroon People's Union attended the Conference of Independent African States and put forward three demands at the meeting: 1. To require the participating countries to adopt a common stance in the United Nations and other international fora to realize the legitimate rights of Cameroon; 2. To require the United Nations to immediately resolve the Cameroonian issue in accordance with the Charter and the Cameroonian aspiration for unity and independence; 3. To declare full support for the Cameroonian struggle and to condemn the bloody suppression in the Cameroonian trust territory. In December 1958, Ouandié, Vice Chairman of the Cameroon People's Union, stated in his speech at the All-African People's Conference that he resolutely opposed colonial rule in Africa and resolutely supported the Algerian people's armed struggle against imperialism. He said: "Colonialism is based on violence; we can only destroy colonialism by adopting the same method."
    Although the Cameroon People's Union is forced to operate underground today, it is receiving increasing support from the Cameroonian people, and its influence is growing. The goal that the Cameroon People's Union is striving for at all costs—a unified and independent Cameroon—will surely be realized with the efforts of the Cameroonian people and the sympathy of people from all countries.

    喀麦隆人民联盟
    喀麦隆人民联盟是喀麦隆全国性最大的政治组织，成立于1948年4月。联盟的总书记是尼奥勃（不久前惨遭法国殖民者杀害）；主席是穆米。喀麦隆人民联盟从它诞生之日起就坚持执行着一个战斗口号：“民族团结——独立”。它为争取统一和独立、为提高人民生活水平、为反对强迫劳动、种族歧视和强占土地而进行了不懈的斗争。它在喀麦隆人民中享有很高威信。
    1955年初，喀麦隆争取统一和独立运动走向新的高涨，全国发生了空前的大罢工。4月22日，以喀麦隆人民联盟为首的各党派发表了一个联合宣言，要求结束“托管”制度，建立喀麦隆主权国家。但是，法国殖民者却对喀麦隆人民进行血腥的镇压，成千上万的人遭到杀害与逮捕，人民联盟受到很大损失。1956年7月13日，法国殖民者惧怕人民力量的壮大，竟然颁布了禁止喀麦隆人民联盟及其他民族主义组织的法令。但是，喀麦隆人民的斗争并没有停止，喀麦隆人民联盟转入了地下斗争。不久，喀麦隆人民就在喀麦隆人民联盟的领导下在萨纳加和马利丁勒的丛林中开始了武装斗争。这一斗争逐渐在扩展着。
    同时，被迫流亡到国外的喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米等领导的喀麦隆人民联盟办事处于1957年在开罗成立，他们为争取独立和各国爱好和平的人民对喀麦隆人民的支持进行了积极活动。1957年12月底，喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米率领代表团出席了亚非人民团结大会，在会上作了关于殖民主义问题的报告，坚决谴责了奴役和剥削非洲各国人民的殖民主义。1958年4月，喀麦隆人民联盟代表列席了非洲独立国家会议，并在会上提出三个要求：一、要求与会国在联合国和其他国际场合采取共同态度来实现喀麦隆的合法权利；二、要求联合国立即根据宪章和喀麦隆争取统一和独立的愿望来解决喀麦隆问题；三、宣布全力支持喀麦隆的斗争并且谴责在喀麦隆托管地进行血腥镇压行动。1958 年12月，喀麦隆人民联盟副主席乌安迪在全非人民大会上的发言中表示坚决反对在非洲的殖民统治并坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民对帝国主义进行的武装斗争。他说：“殖民主义是以暴力为基础的；我们只有采取同样的办法才能够摧毁殖民主义。”
    喀麦隆人民联盟今天虽然被迫处在地下状态，但是它得到喀麦隆人民越来越多的支持，它的影响也越来越大。喀麦隆人民联盟不惜牺牲努力争取的目标——统一和独立的喀麦隆，一定会在喀麦隆人民的努力和各国人民的同情下得到实现。
