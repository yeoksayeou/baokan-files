Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, February 15th: In order to meet the demands of the working masses for theoretical study, factories and mines in Taiyuan are vigorously cultivating a contingent of worker-lecturers. Currently, more than 1,300 workers throughout the city have been absorbed into worker-lecturer groups or teams organized at the workshop or factory level to undertake lecturing work.

These worker-lecturers are all veteran workers from various factories and mines who are active in theoretical study, possess rich practical experience, have good ideological awareness, and a certain level of education. Relevant units have provided them with short-term training through forms such as after-work training, full-time training, and teaching each lesson individually. During the short-term training, they studied the basic knowledge of dialectical materialism and historical materialism and Chairman Mao's works such as "On Contradiction" and "On Practice," combining reading, discussion, and application.

Thanks to the worker-lecturers, it is now very convenient for each factory and mine to conduct lectures. Even under circumstances of intense production, each production team and workshop can still frequently hold classes, allowing workers' theoretical studies to continue regularly. Particularly important is that, because worker-lecturers work and live with the workers in their own teams, they are familiar with the workers' production and ideological situation, and can better implement the principle of integrating theory with practice when lecturing.

Many worker-lecturers are initially using philosophical viewpoints to analyze various practical problems in production and the current ideological situation of the masses, promptly publicizing the Party's policies and resolutions, which has greatly contributed to raising the masses' ideological awareness, resolving internal contradictions among the people, and promoting production development.

Among the worker-lecturers, many hold leadership positions such as production team leaders and work section chiefs, or are veteran workers of grade seven or eight. They not only help their teams and workshops with theoretical study, but also improve their leadership methods and working styles with the weapon of philosophy. For example, Li Genxi, a worker-lecturer at Jinxi Machine Factory, helped the workers in the workshop use the developmental viewpoint of dialectics to analyze the incorrectness of the unchanging view of apprentices. After these workers overcame subjectivism and rigid working methods, the relationship between masters and apprentices was greatly improved, strengthening unity and promoting production work.

    满足工人学习理论的要求 
    太原培养工人讲师队伍
    新华社太原15日电　太原市各厂矿为满足工人群众学习理论的要求，正在大力培养工人讲师队伍。现在全市已有一千三百多名工人被吸收到以车间或厂为单位的工人讲师团或工人讲师小组，担任讲师工作。
    这些工人讲师都是各厂矿理论学习积极分子中富有实际经验、思想意识较好、有一定文化水平的老工人。有关单位通过业余训练、脱产训练、逐课传授等形式对他们进行了短期培养。在短期训练中，他们学习了辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的基础知识和毛主席的矛盾论、实践论等著作，边读书、边讨论、边运用。
    各工矿由于有了工人讲师，讲课非常方便，即使在生产紧张的情况下，每个生产小组、车间也能经常开课，使工人理论学习能坚持进行。特别重要的是，由于工人讲师和本小组工人工作、生活在一起，熟悉工人们的生产和思想情况，讲课时便能更好地贯彻理论联系实际的原则。
    许多工人讲师初步运用哲学观点分析生产中的各种实际问题和当前群众思想情况，及时宣传党的政策、决议，因而对提高群众思想觉悟、解决人民内部矛盾、推动生产发展都有很大的作用。
    工人讲师中，有不少人担负生产组长、工段长等领导职务，或者是七、八级的老工人，他们不仅帮助小组和车间搞好理论学习，而且用哲学武器改进了领导方法和工作作风。如晋西机器厂工人讲师李根喜帮助车间的工人运用辩证法的发展观点，分析了对徒工一成不变的看法的不正确性，使这些工人克服了主观主义和生硬的工作方法后，师徒关系大大改善，增强了团结，也促进了生产工作。
