Manufacturing More and Better Indigenous Fertilizer

Agricultural Production Requires a Large Amount of Indigenous Fertilizer

In order to adapt to the high fertilizer needs of various crops after deep plowing and close planting, and to ensure a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production, a large-scale mass movement for accumulating and producing fertilizer has been launched throughout the country. The main content of this movement has three aspects: vigorously accumulating natural fertilizers, vigorously cultivating green manure, and extensively manufacturing indigenous fertilizers. Accumulating natural fertilizers and planting green manure have a relatively long history in our country, while the widespread use of indigenous methods to manufacture chemical fertilizers is a new development in the history of fertilizer.

Manufacturing indigenous fertilizers requires little investment, simple equipment, and easy operation, facilitating the use of local materials, local production, and local supply. In addition, it also has advantages not found in ordinary farm manure, such as concentrated fertilizer content, fast fertilizer effect, and saving on transportation and labor. According to the rough statistics from the national on-site meeting on accumulating and producing fertilizer held by the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Commerce, and Ministry of Chemical Industry in Zhejiang last November, there are about three million various temporary or long-term indigenous fertilizer plants nationwide, producing about 100 million tons of various indigenous fertilizers. Averaged across the country's cultivated land, each mu can be fertilized with 100 jin of indigenous fertilizer. This has played a significant role in solving the topdressing needs of various crops last year and promoting a bumper harvest in agriculture. Last year, Xiaoping Township in Yuan'an County, Hubei Province, used indigenous fertilizer as topdressing for rice, increasing rice yield by 150 jin per mu. A typical survey in Hebei Province showed that the application of indigenous fertilizer to general crops could increase production by about 20%. Many provinces, cities, and counties have established specialized institutions to guide indigenous fertilizer production and have adopted measures such as setting up experimental factories, forming technical research groups, holding training classes, on-site meetings, and exhibitions to train cadres, exchange experiences, improve technology, and ensure product quality.

Several Major Methods for Manufacturing Indigenous Fertilizer

Last year, many varieties of indigenous fertilizer were created in various places. After testing and analysis, and production appraisal, about 30 kinds were found to be relatively good. According to their main components, they can be roughly divided into four major categories: nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and others.

Nitrogen fertilizer: The main ones include recovering nitrogen from coal and oil shale to manufacture ammonia water, ammonium sulfate, etc. According to analysis, nitrogen is present in most types of coal, averaging about 1%. There are many ways to recover nitrogen from coal, such as during coking and sulfur refining, and it can also be recovered from various lime kilns, brick kilns, flues, or canteen flues. It is estimated that 10 to 15 kilograms of ammonium sulfate can be recovered from refining one ton of coke, 150 to 200 kilograms of ammonium sulfate can be recovered from refining one ton of oil shale crude oil, and 100 kilograms of ammonium sulfate can be recovered from each ton of oil produced from coal refining. Based on such calculations, the manufacture of only 24 million tons of metallurgical coke, 1.6 million tons of shale oil, and 2.2 million tons of coal-to-oil this year could recover more than 800,000 tons of ammonium sulfate. In addition, industrial waste products can be used to make nitrogen fertilizer, such as wastewater from gas plants, glycerol residues, tannery wastewater, wool water, and residues, which can all be used to make ammonium sulfate.

Phosphorus fertilizer: There are two main types of manufacturing methods. One is to directly treat phosphate rock powder with sulfuric acid or factory waste acid to make the phosphoric acid in the phosphate rock powder soluble for crop absorption and utilization. The other is to use high-temperature calcination to destroy the structure of the phosphate rock and make the phosphoric acid therein soluble. The production of calcium-magnesium-potassium fertilizer, etc., belongs to this category.

Potassium fertilizer: Potassium-magnesium fertilizer can be produced from salt by-products and other halogen extracts. Indigenous methods can be used to boil potassium nitrate, and potassium feldspar, lime, gypsum, etc., can be calcined to produce potassium fertilizer or potassium-calcium fertilizer. Alum carnallite can also be used to manufacture potassium fertilizer.

In addition, there are many methods for making glass fertilizer using quartz sand (or broken glass) and trace elements such as copper, zinc, and molybdenum.

The indigenous fertilizer manufactured through the above-mentioned methods generally shows good fertilizer effects. The ammonium sulfate extracted from sulfur residue in Fengjie, Sichuan, has a nitrogen content of 19% to 20%. The ammonium phosphate manufactured from bone meal and sulfur residue in Xuan'en, Hubei, has a nitrogen content of 9.58% and a phosphoric acid content of 11.74%. Other products, such as superphosphate manufactured by indigenous methods in the suburbs of Shanghai, and phosphorus-potassium fertilizer manufactured in Hunan and Guizhou provinces, have high component content and are excellent indigenous fertilizer varieties.

Strengthen Technical Guidance and Improve Quality

This year, agricultural production requires more fertilizer than last year. Not only should the quantity of fertilizer be greater, but the quality should also be better. In addition to accumulating various natural fertilizers, and in the situation where chemical fertilizers produced by large-scale industries still cannot fully meet the needs of agricultural production, it is still very necessary to continue to produce some good varieties of indigenous fertilizer.

At present, the development of indigenous fertilizer production across the country is still very uneven. Some regions produce large quantities, many varieties, and good quality. However, some regions have not yet started, and some regions, although they have started, have some problems due to too rapid development and insufficient experience. For example, the technology has not been mastered by the masses, the rate of defective and substandard products is very high, or the conversion rate of finished products is low. Some regions even use high-temperature cooking of related fertilizers, resulting in a huge waste of human and material resources. To promote the current indigenous fertilizer production work and ensure normal production, the following work needs to be done well:

First, on the basis of summarizing last year's experience, consolidate and strengthen the original indigenous fertilizer factories, and continue to implement the principle of "using local materials, local manufacturing, focusing on indigenous methods, and combining indigenous and foreign methods," so that indigenous fertilizer blossoms everywhere, and continuously improves on the basis of popularization. To do a good job in indigenous fertilizer work, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party, put politics in command, and carry out open debate and discussion, adopt successful experiences such as running experimental fields, and organizing visits and comparisons, and vigorously launch mass movements. Hengyang Prefecture in Hunan Province, has recently established a special leadership organization for indigenous fertilizer production. Leading cadres go deep into factories, run pilot factories, and build experimental furnaces, and work with the masses to learn, do, improve, and promote together, thus creating a 100,000-person indigenous fertilizer manufacturing movement in the entire region.

Second, we must conscientiously help the masses solve the technical problems of indigenous fertilizer. First of all, we must clearly explain to the masses what indigenous fertilizer is. Although indigenous fertilizer is manufactured using indigenous methods, it is basically an inorganic chemical fertilizer. Like machine-made chemical fertilizer, it must undergo certain chemical reactions and chemical processes, and is not a mixture of many fertilizers. Therefore, to engage in indigenous fertilizer production, it is necessary to rely on the leadership of the Party, boldly mobilize the masses, and also have scientific and technological guidance, so as to combine the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses with science and technology.

Great Prospects for Development

Indigenous fertilizer production is not only a way to solve the fertilizer problem quickly, well, and economically in the current situation of insufficient chemical fertilizers, but also a good way to fully utilize local and dispersed resources when the country is able to manufacture a large number of machine-made chemical fertilizers in the future. The resources that can be used to manufacture indigenous fertilizer are infinitely abundant in various places. Many provinces in our country produce coal. Most of this coal is used directly for industrial and civil use, except for a portion used for coking. The valuable oil and nitrogen in it have not been utilized. According to estimates by the Sichuan Provincial Department of Industry, if comprehensively utilized, only the production of ammonium sulfate as a by-product of coal pile dry distillation to make artificial petroleum requires only 20,000 tons of raw coal for an annual production of 1,000 tons, and can recover about 100 tons of ammonium sulfate. In addition, more than 20 provinces in our country have rich peat and phosphate rock, which have not yet been systematically explored, developed, and utilized. Recently, ammonium ore with a nitrogen content as high as 17.98% and a minimum of 0.5% has been discovered in Urumqi, Changji, and other places in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which can be directly used as fertilizer. A nitrate layer with a nitrogen content of 0.4% to 0.5% has been discovered in the Guanzhong Plain area of Shaanxi, with a fertilizer effect similar to that of human manure and urine. According to data from Hebei Province alone, 15 counties in the mountainous areas of the province produce phosphate rock, 16 counties produce potassium feldspar, and 25 counties produce pyrite. The 35 counties in the plains produce nitrate brine, and all coastal counties can use seawater to produce potassium-magnesium fertilizer. And peat is produced everywhere in mountainous areas, plains, and coastal areas. Raw materials are everywhere. The problem is that we should teach the masses the basic knowledge of identifying minerals and finding resources, mobilize the masses to investigate and report on mines, and arrange production in a planned way according to the resource situation.

Issues to Pay Attention to in Production

Judging from the situation of manufacturing indigenous fertilizer in 1958, there are more phosphorus and potassium fertilizers produced, and nitrogen fertilizer is still a weak link. In the future, we should study how to strengthen nitrogen fertilizer production, such as combining coking and oil refining to vigorously recover nitrogen, which is a matter worth paying attention to.

In addition, last year, some regions used organic fertilizer—human manure and urine—plus salt and alkali to make ammonium sulfate or ammonium bicarbonate. This was counterproductive. This practice not only wasted fuel and labor, but also destroyed the fertilizer effect of human manure and urine. Human manure and urine were originally complete fertilizers containing various fertilizer elements. After processing, even if the nitrogen in them can be extracted, the other components are destroyed. Some places add strong acids (sulfuric acid, nitric acid, etc.), strong alkalis, or table salt to organic fertilizer to make indigenous fertilizer, which is also inappropriate. This wastes chemical raw materials, and these things do not contain the three fertilizer elements, which are harmful and useless to crops (although the application of table salt has been reported to be good in some places, it is not applicable to all places).

The indigenous fertilizer production movement is now unfolding in various places. We should seize the opportunity, do more work, and make it increasingly improve on the basis of popularization, so as to better serve agricultural production. (Attached photo)

    制造更多更好的土化肥
    陈西
    农业生产需要大量土化肥
    为了适应深耕密植以后各种农作物对肥料的高度需要，保证农业生产更大、更好、更全面的跃进，全国各地展开了一个大规模的群众性积肥、造肥运动。这个运动的主要内容，有三个方面：大力积攒自然肥料，大力培育绿肥，大量制造土化肥。积攒自然肥料和种植绿肥在我国有较为悠久的历史，而普遍运用土办法制造化学肥料还是肥料史上的一个新发展。
    制造土化肥，投资少，设备简单，操作容易，便于就地取材，就地生产，就地供应；另外还兼有一般农家肥料所不及的优点，如肥分浓缩，肥效快，节省运输和劳力。据去年11月农业部、商业部、化工部在浙江召开的全国积肥、造肥现场会议的粗略统计，全国有各种临时或长期的土化肥厂约三百万个左右，生产了各种土化肥约一亿吨。按全国耕地平均，每亩可施用土化肥一百斤。对解决去年各种农作物追肥，促进农业大丰收起了很大作用。去年，湖北省远安县晓坪乡，用土化肥作水稻追肥，每亩增产稻谷一百五十斤，河北省典型调查施用土化肥一般农作物能增产20％左右。很多省、市、县都成立了指导土化肥生产的专门机构，并采取办试验厂、成立技术研究组，举办训练班，现场会，展览会等办法，培养了干部，交流了经验，提高了技术，保证了产品质量。
    几种主要土化肥的制造方法
    去年各地创造的土化肥品种很多，经过化验分析和生产鉴定，比较好的有三十种左右，按所含主要成分，大概可分为氮、磷、钾和其他四大类：
    氮肥：其中主要的有回收煤和油页岩中的氮素来制造氨水、硫酸铵等。据分析，在各类煤炭中大都存在着氮素，平均约为1％左右。从煤中回收氮的办法很多，例如炼焦、炼硫磺过程中可以回收，各种石灰窑、砖瓦窑、烟道或食堂的烟道中也可以回收，据估计炼一吨焦可以回收硫铵十到十五公斤，炼一吨油页母岩原油可回收一百五十到二百公斤硫铵，煤炼油的每一吨油可以回收硫铵一百公斤。根据这样的计算，今年仅二千四百万吨冶金焦、一百六十万吨页岩油、二百二十万吨煤炼油的制造就可以回收八十万吨以上的硫铵。此外，还有利用各种工业废弃品制成氮肥，如煤气厂的废水、甘油下脚、皮革厂废水、羊毛水及下脚等都可以制硫酸铵。
    磷肥：制造方法主要有两大类，一类是利用硫酸或工厂废酸，直接处理磷矿石粉，使磷矿石粉中的磷酸变成可溶性，供作物吸收利用；另一类是采用高温煅烧来破坏磷矿石的结构，使其中磷酸变成可溶性，如制钙镁钾肥等，都属于这类。
    钾肥：可利用食盐副产等卤提制钾镁肥。土法熬制硝酸钾，利用钾长石、石灰、石膏等煅烧钾肥或钾钙肥，利用明矾光卤石都可以制造钾肥。
    此外还有利用石英砂（或碎玻璃）和微星元素如铜、锌、钼等制玻璃肥料，方法也很多。
    通过以上所说的这些方法，制造出来的土化肥，一般反映肥效很好。四川奉节等地利用硫磺脚渣提制的硫酸铵，产品含氮素达19％—20％；湖北宣恩利用骨粉和硫磺脚渣制造磷酸铵，含氮素达9.58％，磷酸达11.74％；其他如上海郊区土法制过磷酸钙，湖南、贵州等省所制磷钾肥，成分含量都很高，是很好的土化肥品种。
    加强技术指导提高质量
    今年农业生产对肥料的要求比去年更高，不仅肥料的数量要多，而且质量要好，除积足各式各样自然肥料，在大型工业所生产的化肥仍不能充分满足农业增产需要的情况下，继续生产一些好品种的土化肥仍是十分必要的。
    目前全国土化肥生产发展还很不平衡，部分地区生产的数量大、品种多、质量也不错；但也有部分地区还没有搞起来；有的地区虽然搞起来了，但由于发展太快，经验不足，存在一些问题。如技术没有为群众掌握，成品中废品和次品率很大，或者成品转化率低；有的地区甚至用高温熬煮有关肥料，造成人力物力的巨大浪费。为推进当前土化肥生产工作，保证正常生产，需要作好下面的工作：
    第一，要在总结去年经验的基础上，整顿充实原有土化肥工厂，继续贯彻“就地取材，就地制造，以土为主，土洋结合”的方针，使土化肥遍地开花，在普及的基础上不断提高。搞好土化肥工作要加强党的领导，政治挂帅，而且要开展鸣放辩论，采用搞试验田，参观评比等成功经验，大搞群众运动，湖南衡阳专区，最近成立专门领导土化肥的生产机构，领导干部深入工厂，搞试点厂，搞试验炉，和群众一道，边学，边做，边改进，边推广，因而在全区造成了一个十万人的制土化肥运动。
    第二，要认真帮助群众解决土化肥的技术问题。首先向群众交代清楚，什么是土化肥。土化肥虽然是用土办法制造，但基本上是无机化学肥料，和机制化肥一样，要经过一定的化学反应和化学工艺过程，不是许多肥料的混合。因此搞土化肥生产既要依靠党的领导，放手发动群众，而且还要有科学技术作指导，要把技术教给群众，使群众的革命干劲和科学技术结合起来。
    大有发展前途
    土化肥生产不仅在目前化学肥料不足的情况下，是一个多快好省解决肥料问题的途径，就是将来国家能够大量制造机制化肥的时候，制造土化肥也是充分利用地方分散资源的好办法。各地能够制造土化肥的资源是无限丰富的，我国很多省产煤，这些煤除部分用作炼焦外，大部直接用作工业和民用，其中宝贵的油和氮都未加利用。根据四川省工业厅估算，如果综合利用，仅只煤成堆干馏作人造石油副产硫酸铵一项，一个年产一千吨规模的煤成堆干馏厂，每年只要原煤二万吨，即可回收硫酸铵约一百吨。此外我国已有二十多个省蕴藏丰富的草炭和磷矿石，这些都还没有进行有计划的勘查、开发和利用。最近新疆维吾尔自治区乌鲁木齐、昌吉等地发现铵矿石含氮量有的高达17.98％，最低的0.5％，可以直接用作肥料。陕西关中平原一带发现一个硝酸盐层，含氮量达0.4％到0.5％，肥效和人粪尿差不多。仅据河北一省资料，该省山区十五个县产磷矿石，十六个县产钾长石，二十五个县产硫铁矿，平原三十五个县产硝卤，沿海各县都可利用海水制钾镁肥。而山区平原沿海到处产草炭。原料到处有，问题是我们应该把识别矿石和找资源的基本知识教给群众，发动群众查矿、报矿，根据资源情况有计划的安排生产。
    生产中要注意的问题
    从1958年制造土化肥的情况看，土化肥生产中磷、钾肥料较多，氮肥还是一个薄弱环节。今后应该研究如何加强氮肥生产，如结合炼焦、炼油大搞氮的回收，是值得注意的问题。
    另外，去年有些地区用有机肥料——人粪尿加盐加碱等制硫酸铵或碳酸氢铵，这样作是得不偿失的。这种做法既浪费了燃料、劳力，而且破坏了人粪尿的肥效。人粪尿原是含有各种肥料要素的完全肥料，经过加工，即或能取出其中氮素，但却把其他成分都破坏了。有的地方在有机肥料中加入强酸（硫酸硝酸等）、强碱或食盐等制造土化肥，这也是不适宜的。这样，既浪费化工原料，而且这些东西并不含肥料三种要素，对作物来说，有害无益（虽然有些地施用食盐反映还好，但不是任何地方都能施用）。
    现在土化肥生产运动正在各地展开，我们应当抓紧时机，多做些工作，使它在普及的基础上日益提高，更好地为农业生产服务。（附图片）
