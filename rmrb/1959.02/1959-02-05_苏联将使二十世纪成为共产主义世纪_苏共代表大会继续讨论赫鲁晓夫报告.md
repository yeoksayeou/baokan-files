Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 3rd: The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued its session at 4:00 PM (Moscow time) on February 3rd in the Grand Kremlin Palace.

    In the continued discussion of Comrade Khrushchev's report, the First Secretary of the Lithuanian Communist Party Central Committee, S. Cikus, spoke first. He said that the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan fully took into account the interests of each union republic. In the years of Soviet power, tremendous changes had taken place in Lithuanian industry and agriculture, and even more magnificent work would be carried out in the future.

    S. Cikus then said that the enemies of socialism had repeatedly slandered the young Soviet republics on the Baltic coast. After the 20th Congress of the Party, the agents of imperialism attempted to use the measures taken by the Party to eliminate individual superstition and its consequences to achieve their own goals, attempting to undermine confidence in the socialist system and destroy the friendship of all nationalities. But they did not succeed. Life and the reality of the Soviet Union are the best propaganda for the Soviet system.

    The First Secretary of the Turkmen Communist Party Central Committee, Karayev, emphasized in his speech that in the process of discussing the outline of Khrushchev's report, the republic's party organizations and the entire public unanimously agreed with and supported the magnificent tasks of this plan for communist construction.

    The next speaker was Kuzmin, Chairman of the Soviet State Planning Committee and Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers.

    Kuzmin said that the new Seven-Year Plan overcame some of the errors in the previous plans, such as underestimating the role of agriculture, some tasks being too strained, and not being able to guarantee the planned targets with material resources, etc.

    Kuzmin said that we can say with complete justification that the Seven-Year Plan is truly a program for economic construction of the entire party and the entire people.

    In his speech, Kuzmin criticized Belousov's speech. Kuzmin said that Belousov did not mention at all his participation in the anti-Party group. It seemed that he hoped that his activities in the anti-Party group and his failure to expose this group would not be discovered. Kuzmin cited some facts to illustrate that Belousov had supported the anti-Party group's position, for example, he had opposed the Central Committee's proposal on reforming the management of Soviet industry and construction.

    Academician N.M. Semyonov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said in his speech at the afternoon session: "The significance of Soviet science in the development of the national economy has become increasingly important and will continue to grow."

    Semyonov said that according to the Seven-Year Plan, the main research directions of the Soviet Union in physics and mathematics, chemistry, technology, biology, geology and geography, economics, philosophy, law and history have been determined: determining the main directions can create the necessary prerequisites in order to concentrate scientific manpower and material resources in these areas and achieve success as soon as possible in decisive departments.

    Semyonov believed that within the scope of science, it is already possible to use the proposal to hand over certain management powers to social organizations. He believed that it is possible to form various academic science committees composed of some of the most famous scientists.

    Also speaking at the afternoon session were the First Secretary of the Armenian Communist Party Central Committee, Tovmasyan, and the Chairman of the collective farm of Tambov Oblast (Russian Federation), Andreyev.

    At the afternoon meeting, representatives of the Communist Parties of India, Australia, Greece and Mexico successively gave congratulatory speeches to the congress, and their speeches were warmly welcomed by the attendees.

    The afternoon meeting also unanimously elected a resolution drafting committee headed by Comrade Khrushchev to draft a resolution on Comrade Khrushchev's report.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 4th: The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued at 10:00 AM (Moscow time) today in the Grand Kremlin Palace to discuss Khrushchev's report.

    The first speaker at the morning meeting was the famous Soviet agronomist Maltsev of the "Lenin's Legacy" collective farm in Kurgan Oblast. He expressed his complete agreement with the high evaluation of Comrade Khrushchev's report by the representatives who spoke at the congress.

    This agricultural innovator described in detail the work being done by the collective farms in Kurgan Oblast to ensure that droughts do not hinder high yields, and introduced the experience of using fallow land to plant maize.

    The First Secretary of the CPSU Primorsky Krai Committee, Shitikkov, spoke about the development of this krai (the Soviet Far East) and said that in the next seven years, the power industry, machine manufacturing industry and chemical industry of this krai will be rapidly developed. By 1965, the total output value of the krai will increase by 73% compared with 1958.

    The next speaker was the Chairman of the State Security Committee, Shelepin. He said that people call the 20th century the century of electricity and radio, the century of the atom. Our people will call the 20th century the century of communism, and the time is not far off.

    The speaker said that the state security organs point the sharp sword of the proletariat at the spies sent to our country by the imperialist countries. If we shrink the work of the state security organs, we will disarm ourselves, and the imperialists will be very happy. But their illusions will not come true.

    When Shelepin talked about the rampant espionage activities carried out by Western countries against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, he said that the US Central Intelligence Agency has an organization with more than 20,000 people. The working funds recently allocated to this bureau have reached 1.5 billion US dollars per year. Forty American espionage agencies have been established in West Germany. In West Berlin alone, there are sixty espionage organizations from the United States and other Western countries operating.

    Shelepin assured the congress that the staff of the Soviet state security organs will do everything in their power to protect the security of the Soviet state and its citizens.

    Shelepin then said that the consequences of the hostile activities of Beria and his followers have been eliminated in the state security organs. Revolutionary legality has been restored in our country, and the criminals who violated this legality have been punished. Every Soviet citizen can believe that this shameful act will never be repeated.

    Shelepin said that the function of state security organs in punishing criminals is increasingly diminishing in the country. We should adopt such a policy in our work: strengthen educational work and take preventive measures to avoid possible crimes, especially for young people. It is appropriate to implement such a system, that is, young people who commit minor crimes are not tried by the court, but guaranteed by social organizations, allowing them to atone for their crimes in the collective rather than in prison. While improving the role of comrade trial meetings and implementing other educational measures, the above methods will produce good results in the struggle against disrupting social order and the norms of socialist common life.

    The First Secretary of the CPSU Stavropol Krai Committee, Lebedev, spoke about the great potential of this krai for further developing the national economy, saying that not long ago, fourteen huge natural gas producing areas and six oil fields were discovered here.

    Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Dmitri Ustinov, focused on the achievements of the Soviet Union in the development of rocket technology in his speech. He said that the launch of the Soviet artificial earth satellite demonstrated the successful development of rocket technology. Gradually increasing the volume and weight of satellites makes it possible to implement a wide range of plans for scientific observation in areas where people have never set up instruments. At the same time, the Soviet Union has also improved the flight quality of the artificial satellites it has launched.

    Ustinov pointed out that the Party attaches great importance to the development of rocket technology. Therefore, the Soviet Union has already been producing various types of intercontinental rockets in batches. The Soviet armed forces possess powerful weapons, and if attacked, they can give any aggressor and adventurer the due counterattack.

    In the last part of his speech, Ustinov pointed out that in the next seven years, the Soviet Union's rocket technology will be developed more rapidly. There is no doubt that Soviet science will firmly occupy the first place in rocket manufacturing and a series of other state-of-the-art productions.

    The First Secretary of the CPSU Stalingrad Oblast Committee, Zhagarin, said in his speech that the Soviet people are closely watching the Party Congress, and they are happy to realize that communism is no longer a fantasy, but a reality in the near future.

    M. Saburov said in his speech that the Seven-Year Plan discussed by the Congress is the victory of the collective wisdom of the Communist Party and the Soviet people. At the same time, this plan also proved the bankruptcy of the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin and Shepilov, who groundlessly opposed the Party's major measures. Saburov admitted that he made a mistake in June 1957 and showed political instability. He described the beginning and end of this mistake and realized that the anti-Party group took its own special position on various issues and tried to hinder the implementation of the important measures formulated by the Central Committee. Saburov said that this was the case on issues such as reclaiming wasteland, implementing a new planned system, and catching up with the United States in terms of per capita agricultural output. The anti-Party group also opposed the introduction of a series of foreign policy issues or hindered the solution of these issues.

    Saburov said that he did not agree with the views of the participants of the anti-Party group, but on the eve of the June 1957 plenum, he had stood on the position of this group to criticize the work of the Presidium of the Central Committee. At that time, according to the resolution of the plenum, Saburov's qualifications as a member of the Presidium were revoked. Saburov said that he is now the director of a factory in Syzran and is trying to redeem his mistakes to the Party and the people with his work.

    Representatives of the fraternal parties of Belgium, Sweden, Canada, Chile, Ecuador, Ceylon, Lebanon, the Netherlands and Colombia delivered speeches at the morning meeting. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by all the representatives.

    苏联将使二十世纪成为共产主义世纪
    苏共代表大会继续讨论赫鲁晓夫报告
    新华社莫斯科3日电　苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会3日下午四时（莫斯科时间）在大克里姆林宫继续开会。
    在继续讨论赫鲁晓夫同志报告时，立陶宛共产党中央委员会第一书记斯?奇库斯首先发言。他说，七年计划控制数字全面考虑到各加盟共和国的利益。在苏维埃政权年代中，立陶宛的工农业发生了巨大的变化。而今后还要进行更宏伟的工作。
    斯?奇库斯接着说，社会主义的敌人曾一再诽谤波罗的海沿岸各年轻的苏维埃共和国。在党的第二十次代表大会以后，帝国主义代理人企图利用党所采取的关于消除个人迷信及其后果的措施来达到自己的目的，企图破坏对社会主义制度的信心，破坏各民族的友谊。但是他们并没有得逞。生活和苏联的真实情况是苏维埃制度的最好宣传。
    土库曼共产党中央委员会第一书记卡拉耶夫在发言时强调指出，在讨论赫鲁晓夫报告提纲的过程中，共和国党组织和全体公众都一致赞同和拥护共产主义建设的这个计划的宏伟任务。
    接着发言的是苏联国家计划委员会主席、苏联部长会议副主席库兹明。
    库兹明说，新的七年计划克服了过去几个计划中的一些错误：如对农业的作用估计不足，一些任务过于紧张，不能以物质资源保证预定指标等等。
    库兹明说，我们可以完全有根据地说，七年计划真正是我国全党、全民性的经济建设纲领。
    库兹明在发言中批评了别尔乌辛的发言。库兹明说，别尔乌辛一点也没有谈到自己参加反党集团的事。看来，他指望他在反党集团中的活动以及他不揭露这个集团的作为不会被人发觉。库兹明举出了一些事实，说明别尔乌辛曾支持过反党集团的立场，例如，他曾反对中央委员会关于改组苏联工业和建筑业管理的建议。
    苏联科学院院长?斯米扬诺夫院士在下午会议上发言时说：“苏联科学在国民经济发展中的意义已经越来越大，而且还将与日俱增。
    ?斯米扬诺夫说，根据七年计划，苏联在物理数学、化学、工艺学、生物学、地质地理学、经济学、哲学、法律学和历史学方面的主要研究方向已经确定：确定主要方向就可以创造必要的前提，以便把科学上的人力物力集中到这些方面，并且尽快地在决定性部门内取得成就。
    ?斯米扬诺夫认为，在科学范围内已经可以利用把某些管理职权交给社会团体的主张。他认为由一些最著名的科学人士组成各种学术的科学委员会是可能的。
    在下午会议上发言的还有亚美尼亚共产党中央委员会第一书记托夫马相和坦波夫州（俄罗斯联邦）集体农庄主席安德烈耶夫。
    在下午会议上，印度、澳大利亚、希腊和墨西哥共产党的代表们相继向代表大会致了贺词，他们的讲话受到了到会者的热烈欢迎。
    下午会议还一致选举以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的决议起草委员会，来起草关于赫鲁晓夫同志报告的决议。
    新华社莫斯科4日电　苏共第二十一次代表大会今天上午十时
  （莫斯科时间）继续在大克里姆林宫举行，讨论赫鲁晓夫的报告。
    在上午会议上首先发言的是苏联著名农学家、库尔干州“列宁遗训”集体农庄的马尔采夫。他表示完全同意在大会上发言的代表们对赫鲁晓夫同志报告的高度评价。
    这位农业革新家详细叙述了库尔干州集体农庄正在设法使旱灾不致妨碍高产的工作情况，并介绍了利用休耕地来种植玉蜀黍的经验。
    苏共滨海边疆区委员会第一书记什蒂科夫在发言中谈到这个边疆区（苏联的远东）的发展情况时说，在今后七年中，这个边疆区的动力工业、机器制造业和化学工业将得到迅速发展，到1965年，边疆区生产的总产值将比1958年增加73％。
    接着发言的是国家安全委员会主席谢列平。他说，人们把二十世纪称为电气和无线电的世纪，原子的世纪。我国人民将要把二十世纪称为共产主义世纪，这已是为时不远了。
    发言人说，国家保安机关把无产阶级的锐利剑锋指向帝国主义国家派到我国来的间谍。如果我们收缩国家保安机关机构的工作，我们就解除了武装，这样，帝国主义者就会很高兴。但是他们的幻想是实现不了的。
    谢列平谈到了西方国家对苏联和人民民主国家所进行的猖獗的间谍活动时说，美国中央情报局拥有一个有两万多人的机构。最近拨给这个局的工作经费达到了每年十五亿美元。西德境内设立了四十个美国间谍机构。仅在西柏林一地就有六十个美国和其他西方国家的间谍组织在活动。
    谢列平向大会保证，苏联国家保安机关的工作人员将尽他们的一切努力来保障苏维埃国家及其公民的安全。
    谢列平接着说，在国家保安机关中消除了贝利亚及其追随者的敌对活动的后果。在我国恢复了革命的法制，而破坏这种法制的罪犯已被惩办了。每个苏联公民可以相信，这种可耻的勾当永远不会重复。
    谢列平说，国家保安机关对罪犯的惩办职能在国内愈来愈缩小。在我们的工作中应当采取这样的方针：加强教育工作和采取避免可能犯罪的预防性措施，对青年尤应这样。实行这样的制度是适宜的，即犯罪不大的青年人，不由法庭来审判，而由社会团体担保，容许他在集体中而不是在监狱中赎罪。在提高同志审判会的作用和实行其他教育措施的同时，上述办法会在反对破坏社会秩序和社会主义共同生活准则的斗争中产生良好的效果。
    苏共斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区委员会第一书记列别杰夫在发言中谈到这个边疆区的进一步发展国民经济的巨大潜力时说，不久前，这里发现了十四处巨大的天然瓦斯产地和六处油田。
    苏联部长会议副主席德米特里·乌斯季诺夫在发言中着重谈到了苏联火箭技术发展的成就。他说，苏联人造地球卫星的发射表明了火箭技术的顺利发展。逐渐增加卫星的体积和重量，使得实现在那些人们从来没有设置过仪器的地区进行科学观察的广泛计划成为可能。与此同时，苏联还改进了它所发射的人造卫星的飞行质量。
  乌斯季诺夫指出，党十分重视火箭技术的发展。因此苏联已经在成批生产各种类型的洲际火箭。苏联武装部队拥有强有力的武器，一旦受到侵犯时，它可以给任何侵略者和冒险家以应有的反击。
    乌斯季诺夫在发言的最后指出，今后七年中，苏联的火箭技术将得到更迅速的发展。毫无疑问，苏联科学在火箭制造和一系列其他最新式生产中将稳居首位。
    苏共斯大林格勒州委员会第一书记热加林在发言中说，苏联人民密切注视着党的代表大会，他们高兴地意识到，共产主义已经不是幻想，而是不远的未来的现实。
    马·萨布罗夫在发言中说，代表大会所讨论的七年计划是共产党和苏联人民集体智慧的胜利。同时，这个计划也证明了马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团的破产，他们毫无理由地反对党的各项重大措施。萨布罗夫承认，他在1957年6月犯了错误，在政治上表现得不坚定。他叙述了这个错误的始末，并且认识到，反党集团在各种问题上采取了自己的特殊立场，竭力阻挠中央委员会制定的重要措施的实现。萨布罗夫说，在关于开垦荒地、实行新的计划化制度、以及在按人口平均计算的农产品产量上赶上美国的口号等等问题上情况都是这样。反党集团也反对一系列外交政策问题的提出或者阻碍这些问题的解决。
    萨布罗夫说，他不同意反党集团参加者的观点，但是他在1957年6月全会的前夕，曾经站在这个集团的立场上批评过中央委员会主席团的工作。当时根据全会的决议，取消了萨布罗夫主席团委员的资格。萨布罗夫说，现在他在西兹兰的一个工厂当厂长，竭力用自己的工作来赎回对党和人民的过错。
    在上午会议上致词的有比利时、瑞典、加拿大、智利、厄瓜多尔、锡兰、黎巴嫩、荷兰和哥伦比亚九个国家的兄弟党的代表。他们的讲话受到全体代表的热烈欢迎。
