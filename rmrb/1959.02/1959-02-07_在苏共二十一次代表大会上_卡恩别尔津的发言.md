Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 30th (TASS dispatch): Karnberzin, Alternate Member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Latvia, delivered a speech at the 21st Congress of the CPSU on the afternoon of January 29.

He said that the 21st Extraordinary Congress of the CPSU was convened amidst an unprecedented upsurge in the political atmosphere and great victories in production in the Soviet state.

The great achievements made by our people before the 21st Congress were the result of the Soviet people's hard struggle to implement the resolutions of the 20th Congress.

The reorganization of the management of industry and construction is the most important factor in accelerating the development of socialist industry. It is worth noting that all the union republics and all the economic regions completed the 1958 industrial production plan ahead of schedule. Most economic regions, including the economic region of our republic, overproduced industrial products worth billions of rubles.

Although Soviet Latvia embarked on the road of socialist development twenty years later than other Soviet republics, thanks to the unbreakable friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union and the brotherly assistance of the Soviet republics, Latvia has advanced alongside other union republics and greeted the 21st Extraordinary Congress of the Party with great victories in all sectors of the national economy.

Latvia's industry is developing rapidly. It suffices to mention that in 1958, the total industrial output value of the republic increased almost eightfold compared with 1940.

The new seven-year plan stipulates that Latvia will further increase its industrial output significantly. The total industrial output value should increase by 65%. In the next seven years, the most important tasks of our republic are to develop the electrical industry and radio technology industry, instrument manufacturing, transportation machinery manufacturing, and the fishing industry. The total output value of the machinery manufacturing and metal processing industries will increase by 1.5 times. The increase in the total industrial output value mainly depends on increasing labor productivity on the original production sites, adopting new technologies and advanced processes, strengthening enterprise specialization and collaboration, and replacing outdated equipment. The republic's various agencies must pay more attention to the power industry and the chemical industry.

The republic's party organization has expressed great concern for the further development of agriculture. The discussion of Comrade Khrushchev's report outline and the resolutions of the December Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union showed that the seven-year plan for meat and milk production may be completed in four or five years, and by the end of the seven-year plan, the production volume may reach 800 quintals of milk and 100 quintals (calculated by slaughter weight) of meat per 100 hectares. Relying on expanding pig farming, fattening cattle, raising young livestock, developing sheep farming, and breeding waterfowl will greatly increase meat production. Kahnberzin finally talked about the improvement of all political activities of the party after the 20th Congress, which were closely combined with the solution of special economic problems. After the 20th Congress, fundamental changes took place in the work content, work style, and work methods of the district committees and municipal committees of the Communist Party of Latvia. The Leninist norms of party life were restored. The initiative of the party members was greatly enhanced. Most leading cadres often personally participate in mass work. Practice has provided many new and effective ways to train cadres and do mass work. While strengthening political and organizational work among the masses, resolutely overcoming the shortcomings that still exist, and opposing pride, complacency, and arrogance, we will go all out to realize the great instructions of our dear Leninist Communist Party.

    在苏共二十一次代表大会上
    卡恩别尔津的发言
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科1月30日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会主席团候补委员、拉脱维亚共产党中央委员会第一书记卡恩别尔津29日下午在苏共第二十一次代表大会上发了言。
    他说，苏共第二十一次非常代表大会是在苏维埃国家政治上空前高涨、生产上取得巨大胜利的情况下召开的。
    我国人民在第二十一次代表大会以前所取得的伟大成果是苏联人民为实现第二十次代表大会决议而紧张奋斗的结果。
    改组工业和建筑业管理是加速发展社会主义工业的最重要的因素。值得注意的是，所有的加盟共和国和所有的经济区都提前完成了1958年工业产品生产计划。大部分经济区，其中包括我们共和国的经济区，超额生产了数十亿卢布的工业产品。
    虽然苏维埃拉脱维亚比其他苏维埃共和国迟二十年走上社会主义发展道路，但是，由于苏联各族人民的牢不可破的友谊和各苏维埃共和国的兄弟帮助，拉脱维亚已和其他各加盟共和国并肩前进，并且以国民经济各部门的巨大胜利迎接了第二十一次党的非常代表大会。
    拉脱维亚的工业正在飞速发展着。只要谈一点就够了，1958年，共和国的工业总产值差不多比1940年增加了八倍。
    新的七年计划规定拉脱维亚进一步大大提高工业产量。工业总产值应该增加65％。今后七年中，我们共和国的最重要的任务是发展电气工业和无线电技术工业、仪器制造业、运输机器制造业以及渔业。机器制造业和金属加工业的总产值将增加一点五倍。工业总产值的增长主要依靠在原有的生产现场上提高劳动生产率，在采用新技术和先进工艺，加强企业专业化和协作以及替换陈旧设备的基础上达到。共和国的各个机关必须对动力工业和化学工业予以更大的注意。
    共和国的党组织对农业的进一步发展表示了巨大的关心。关于赫鲁晓夫同志报告提纲和苏联共产党中央委员会十二月全体会议的决议的讨论表明，肉类和奶类生产的七年计划可能在四、五年内完成，并且到七年计划结束时生产量可能达到每一百公顷八百公担奶类和一百公担（按屠宰量计算）的肉类。依靠扩大养猪业、喂肥牛、饲养幼畜，发展养羊业和繁殖泳禽类，将使肉类产量大大增加。卡恩列尔津最后谈到在第二十次代表大会之后党的所有政治活动的改进，这些活动和特殊经济问题的解决密切结合起来了。在第二十次代表大会以后，拉脱维亚共产党各区委会和市委会在工作内容、工作作风和工作方法方面发生了根本的变化。恢复了党的生活的列宁准则。党员群众的积极性大大提高了。大多数领导干部经常亲自参加群众工作。实践提供了许多培养干部和搞群众工作的新的有效方式。在加强群众中的政治工作和组织工作，坚决克服现在还存在的缺点，反对骄傲自满和自高自大的同时，我们将全力以赴来实现我们亲爱的列宁主义共产党的伟大指示。
