Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, February 12th, TASS dispatch: The Soviet government delegation, which had been negotiating with the Iranian King and the Iranian government in Tehran on the conclusion of a Soviet-Iranian treaty of friendship and non-aggression, declared to the Iranian government that, since the Iranian government refused to conclude the treaty (the draft of the treaty was proposed by Iran itself) and decided to sign a military agreement with the United States against the Soviet Union, the Soviet government considered that the continuation of the negotiations had lost its meaning.

The negotiations began on January 29 this year at the initiative of the Iranian side. The members of the Soviet delegation were Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Semenov, Soviet Ambassador to Iran Begov, and Director of the Middle East Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry Pavlov.

The Soviet delegation's statement pointed out that during the negotiations, the Soviet delegation had stated that the Soviet government fully accepted the draft treaty proposed by the Iranian government. After this, the Iranian government immediately denied the original draft it had proposed, put forward new conditions, and began to delay the negotiations as much as possible.

Among them, the Iranian government insisted on including in the treaty that the Soviet government agreed to the actions already taken or that might be taken by Iran due to its participation in the Baghdad Pact. The Iranian side did not agree to undertake the obligation not to conclude bilateral treaties with third countries that were against the Soviet Union. In addition, the Iranian government stated that it would sign a bilateral military agreement with the United States.

The Soviet government and Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev himself authorized the Soviet delegation to declare to the Iranian government that the Soviet government advocated the signing of a new Soviet-Iranian treaty, because this treaty would consolidate the friendship and cooperation between the two neighboring countries and would help eliminate distrust and misunderstanding in Soviet-Iranian relations.

The Soviet delegation handed the Soviet draft treaty on Soviet-Iranian friendship, non-aggression, and cooperation to the Iranian King, which took into account many provisions in the Iranian draft. At the same time, the Soviet draft contained a series of provisions aimed at broader development of friendly cooperation between the two countries. The Soviet government did everything possible to satisfy the wishes of the Iranian side.

The Soviet delegation's statement emphasized that, from the Iranian government's point of view, the negotiations were nothing more than a trick with bad intentions, and it intended to use the negotiations to deceive public opinion, especially Iranian public opinion.

The statement said that the Soviet government has conclusive materials to prove that in the first few days after the Soviet delegation arrived in Tehran, the Iranian King undertook obligations to foreign countries not to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union, and stated that he intended to sign an agreement with the United States. It can be seen that the Iranian government had decided in advance that it would sign a military agreement with the United States against the Soviet Union.

The statement pointed out that all this shows that the Iranian government and the Iranian King are pursuing a two-faced and insincere policy towards the Soviet Union, which cannot but have serious consequences for Iran first and foremost. The current actions of the Iranian government have cancelled the path that has emerged for the development of good-neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Iran.

The statement said that, of course, all this at the same time means that the actions of the Iranian government are a turning point in Soviet-Iranian relations, because everyone understands that the Soviet Union cannot ignore Iran's actions that are not conducive to improving relations between our two countries and not conducive to maintaining peace.

The statement said that, naturally, the Iranian government's adoption of hostile steps towards the Soviet Union can only prove that the Iranian government is now openly following the aggressive policy pursued by the United States in the Near and Middle East, and is openly embarking on the road of cooperation with those foreign aggressive forces that are keen to exacerbate the tension between the Soviet Union and Iran and the tension in the entire Near and Middle East.

### 苏联政府代表团发表声明  伊朗政府采取敌视苏联的态度  苏伊两国继续谈判已失去意义

    苏联政府代表团发表声明
    伊朗政府采取敌视苏联的态度
    苏伊两国继续谈判已失去意义
    新华社13日讯　塔斯社德黑兰12日讯：曾经在德黑兰同伊朗国王和伊朗政府就缔结苏伊友好和互不侵犯条约举行谈判的苏联政府代表团向伊朗政府声明说，由于伊朗政府拒绝缔结条约（条约草案是伊朗自己提出的），并且决定同美国签订反对苏联的军事协定，苏联政府认为继续谈判已经失去意义。
    谈判是根据伊朗方面的倡议在今年1月29日开始举行的。苏联代表团的成员有苏联外交部副部长谢苗诺夫、苏联驻伊朗大使别哥夫以及苏联外交部中东司司长巴夫洛夫。
    苏联代表团的声明中指出，在谈判过程中，苏联代表团曾经表示苏联政府完全接受伊朗政府提出的条约草案。在这以后伊朗政府却马上否定了自己原来提出的草案，提出新的条件，并且开始尽量拖延谈判。
    其中，伊朗政府坚持要在条约中载明苏联政府同意由于伊朗参加巴达格条约而已经采取或可能采取的行动。伊朗方面不同意承担不同第三国缔结反对苏联的双边条约这一义务。此外，伊朗政府表示它将同美国签订双边军事协定。
    苏联政府和部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫本人授权苏联代表团向伊朗政府声明过，苏联政府主张签订新的苏伊条约，因为这项条约将巩固两个毗邻国家的友好和合作，将有助于消除苏伊关系间的不信任和误解。
    苏联代表团曾经把苏联关于苏伊友好、互不侵犯和合作条约的草案交给伊朗国王，其中考虑了伊朗草案中的许多条款。同时，苏联草案中包含了一系列旨在更广泛发展两国间友好合作的条款。苏联政府尽一切可能来满足伊朗方面的愿望。
    苏联代表团声明中强调指出，从伊朗政府方面来说，谈判不过是一种怀着不良企图的把戏，它打算用谈判来蒙混公众的视听，首先是蒙混伊朗公众的视听。
    声明中说，苏联政府掌握有确凿材料，足以证明当苏联代表团抵达德黑兰的最初几天，伊朗国王就向外国承担了不同苏联缔结协定的义务，并且声明，他打算同美国签订协定。由此可见，伊朗政府预先就决定它要同美国签订反对苏联的军事协定。
    声明中指出，所有这一切说明，伊朗政府同伊朗国王对苏联执行着两面派的不真诚的政策，这不能不首先对伊朗引起严重后果。伊朗政府当前的做法取消了已经出现的发展苏伊两国睦邻关系的路线。
    声明中说，当然，同时所有这一切意味着伊朗政府的行动是苏伊相互关系中的转折点，因为，人人都明白，苏联对伊朗这种不利于改善我们两国关系和不利于维护和平的举动是不能置若罔闻的。
    声明中说，自然，伊朗政府采取敌视苏联的步骤只能证明伊朗政府现在公开追随美国在中近东实行的侵略政策，公开地走上同那些热衷于加剧苏联和伊朗间紧张局势和整个中近东紧张局势的外国侵略势力合作的道路。
