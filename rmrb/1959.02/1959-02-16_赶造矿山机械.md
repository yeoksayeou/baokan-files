    Expedite the Manufacture of Mining Machinery

    Today, this newspaper publishes news about Shanghai, Luoyang, Guiyang, Beijing, and other machinery factories stepping up the manufacture of mining machinery. The workers of these factories, like the steelworkers, are standing on the front lines of the battle for 18 million tons of steel. Their labor is of particularly important significance at this time.

    To fight for 18 million tons of steel, the most important link at present is to seize the first few "processes" of steel production - mining, ore dressing, coal washing, and coking. Mining machinery serves these "processes." In order to expand the production capacity of these "processes" as quickly as possible, so that the blast furnaces can eat their fill and eat well, mining machinery serving these "processes" must be manufactured as quickly as possible. In particular, a batch of simple coal washing equipment recently needed by the coal industry is used in conjunction with simple coking furnaces, and it is related to the supply of coke needed by the vast majority of medium-sized steel plants and a part of the coke needed by bases such as Baotou Steel. Efforts should be made to put this batch of equipment into production one after another in the second quarter. Therefore, ensuring the completion of this batch of simple coal washing equipment on schedule has become an even more urgent task.

    How to complete such a heavy and urgent task? Relying on the construction of new mining machinery factories will take a little longer and will not solve the problem in the short term. The main thing is to rely on the existing mining machinery factories. Shanghai, Luoyang, Guiyang, and Beijing's four mining machinery factories are all making great efforts in the technical revolution to increase production capacity, which is the most important method. We hope that all factories manufacturing mining equipment will make another effort, beat the drums of the technical revolution louder, and strive to make greater contributions in the great battle to seize 18 million tons of steel.

    However, relying solely on existing mining machinery factories is still not enough to meet the needs. This requires adopting a second method - expanding the ranks of manufacturing mining machinery. Some factories have not produced mining machinery in the past, and some factories have produced small ones but not large ones. Now, under the requirements of the situation, it is hoped that some "brave elements" will emerge in these factories, break the mystery of manufacturing mining machinery, and boldly participate in the ranks of manufacturing mining equipment and large-scale mining equipment. Mining machinery is generally not very precise machinery, and there are relatively few technical difficulties in manufacturing it. For the manufacture of larger mining machinery, some factories lack equipment, and they can also use methods such as segmented splicing, "ants gnawing at bones," and self-made indigenous equipment to solve the problem.

    To ensure the completion of the manufacturing task of mining machinery, it is also necessary to pay close attention to the issue of materials. The amount of steel and steel plates required for mining machinery is relatively large, and the metallurgical industry department should give active support. In particular, wear-resistant metal materials such as ferromanganese are indispensable for mining machinery, and efforts should be made to ensure their supply. Manufacturing factories should actively mobilize the masses to save raw materials through methods such as modifying designs. Mining machinery is relatively bulky, and there is great potential for saving materials. According to the analysis of the products of some factories by relevant departments, if certain modifications are made in the design, it is entirely possible to save more than 10% of metal materials. Saving materials, making one more crusher, ball mill, or washing and beneficiation machine, can enable the blast furnace to obtain more finely selected ore and coking coal earlier, and it can also enable the steelmaking furnace to obtain more and better pig iron. Therefore, in the technical revolution movement, it is necessary for each factory to take saving raw materials as an important topic and mobilize the masses to solve it.

    The vast majority of the production tasks of manufacturing mining machinery, especially manufacturing simple coal washing equipment, are undertaken by local factories. Therefore, it is hoped that the relevant local party committees and economic leading organs will firmly grasp the leadership of this work, and place mining machinery in an important position in terms of both the arrangement of forces and the distribution of raw materials. In particular, the recently needed batch of simple coal washing equipment and corresponding simple coking furnaces should be given priority guarantees without affecting rolling steel, power stations, and important mining equipment.

### 赶造矿山机械

    赶造矿山机械
    今天本报发表了上海、洛阳、贵阳、北京等四个机械厂加紧制造矿山机械的消息。这些工厂的职工同志们，同钢铁工人一样，站在为一千八百万吨钢而战的最前线。他们的劳动在当前有着特殊重要的意义。
    为一千八百万吨钢而战，当前最重要的环节是抓紧钢铁生产开头的几道“工序”——采矿、选矿、洗煤、炼焦。矿山机械就是为这些“工序”服务的。为了尽快地扩大这些“工序”的生产能力，让高炉吃得饱、吃得好，就得尽快地把为这些“工序”服务的矿山机械造出来。特别是最近煤炭工业部门需要的一批简易洗煤设备，是配合简易炼焦炉使用的，它关系着绝大部分中型钢铁厂所需要的焦炭和包钢等基地所需要的一部分焦炭的供应。这一批设备要争取在第二季度陆续投入生产。因此，保证按期完成这一批简易洗煤设备，就成为更加迫切的任务。
    怎样完成这样繁重而紧迫的任务呢？靠新建矿山机械厂，时间要晚一些，短期内解决不了问题；主要的还是要靠现有的矿山机械厂。上海、洛阳、贵阳、北京这四个矿山机械厂都在大闹技术革命来提高生产能力，这是一个最重要的方法。我们希望各个制造矿山设备的工厂，再加一把劲，把技术革命的锣鼓敲得更响，力争在夺取一千八百万吨钢的伟大战斗中建立更大的功勋。
    然而，只靠现有的矿山机械厂，也还满足不了需要。这就要采取第二个方法——扩大制造矿山机械的队伍。有些厂过去没有生产过矿山机械，有的厂生产过小的没有生产过大的。现在在形势的要求下，希望这些工厂中出现一些“勇敢分子”，打破制造矿山机械的神秘感，大胆地参加到制造矿山设备和大型矿山设备的队伍里来。矿山机械一般说来不是十分精密的机械，制造起来，技术上的困难比较少。制造较大的矿山机械，有些厂缺乏设备，也可以用分段拼接、“蚂蚁啃骨头”和自造土设备等办法来解决。
    要保证完成矿山机械的制造任务，还必须十分重视材料问题。矿山机械需要的钢材钢板数量比较大，冶金工业部门应当给以积极的支持。特别是锰铁等耐磨的金属材料，是矿山机械不可缺少的，更要设法保证供应。制造工厂，则应该积极发动群众，通过修改设计等途径来节约原材料。矿山机械比较笨重，节约材料的潜力很大。根据有关部门对一部分工厂产品的分析，在设计上如果进行某些修改，节约10％以上的金属材料，是完全可能的。节约材料，多做一台粉碎机、球磨机或洗选机，就能够使高炉早日得到更多精选的矿石和焦煤，也就可以使炼钢炉得到更多更好的生铁。因此，各厂在技术革命运动中，有必要把节约原材料作为一项重要的课题，发动群众来解决。
    制造矿山机械，特别是制造简易洗煤设备，绝大部分生产任务都是地方工厂担负的。因此，希望有关的地方党委和经济领导机关抓紧对这项工作的领导，无论在力量的安排上、原材料的分配上，都要把矿山机械放在重要的地位。特别是最近需要的一批简易洗煤设备和相应的简易炼焦炉，更要在不影响轧钢、电站和重要矿山设备的条件下，优先地给以保证。
