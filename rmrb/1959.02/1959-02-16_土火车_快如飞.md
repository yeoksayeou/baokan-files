    Earth Train Flies Like the Wind
    One day in early December last year, Peng Zhigang, a cadre stationed in the Xinshidu Commune of Yiyang County, Hunan, climbed the 700-meter-high Zhaizilun with the Party Branch Deputy Secretary and Middle Team Leader to scout for fertilizer sources. They struggled through the tall grass, finally discovering that beneath the grass was black soil, with a rotten odor. Digging down, some places were one or two feet deep, and generally seven or eight inches deep, feeling soft and spongy underfoot. They estimated that at least 1.2 million dan could be dug here, enough to fertilize 5,000 mu of land with more than 200 dan per mu. After returning, they sent the handfuls of soil they brought back to the relevant units for testing, which proved it to be a very good natural fertilizer.

    Now that the fertilizer source was found, Zhaizilun Mountain was high and the road was far. If transported by human labor, each person could only carry three or four loads a day at most, resulting in low efficiency and tight labor. What to do? After discussion, it was decided to wage a major battle on Zhaizilun, assigning a small number of people to clean the fertilizer field, while another group built a 400-meter-long cableway from the mountainside to the depression to transport the fertilizer. Then, a 15-li-long earth train track was built to transport the fertilizer to the fields.

    A large-scale fertilizer collection battle unfolded on Zhaizilun Mountain at the end of December last year. More than two thousand reinforcements spent two days and two nights splitting open a mountain, crossing two ponds, and flying over a stream, quickly laying the roadbed for the 15-li-long earth train track. One hundred and twenty carpenters followed closely, felling trees and sawing wood, working day and night to lay rails, build cableways, and make earth trains. The ironworkers and stoneworkers also displayed their great skills on the mountain, making iron nails, repairing tools, opening mountains and chiseling rocks, and building piers and bridges. One hundred soldiers cleared the mountain and dug up roots. By January 16th, the cableway was built, and the earth train was made. The black fertilizer soil flowed like water straight towards the fields.

    土火车  快如飞
    去年12月初的一天，湖南益阳县新市渡公社驻社干部彭至刚，同党总支副书记、中队长，爬上了七百公尺高的寨子仑去侦察肥源。他们在茅草丛中艰苦地钻进钻出，终于发现茅草底下尽是黑色泥土，一股腐臭气味，挖下去，有的地方有一、两尺深，一般也有七、八寸深，用脚踏下去软绵绵的。他们计算了一下，这里至少可挖一百二十万担，能使五千亩田每亩施上二百多担。回去后，他们把带回的几把土送到有关单位化验，证明是一种很好的自然肥料。
    肥源有了，但是寨子仑山高路远，用人挑，每人每天最多只能挑三、四次，工效低、劳力紧，怎么办呢？经大家研究，决定大战寨子仑，派少数人打扫肥场，另外一批人，从山腰到山坳架四百公尺索道运肥，再从坳内修一条长十五里的土火车道，把肥运到田间。
    一场规模巨大的取肥战斗，去年12月底就在寨子仑山上展开了。两千多个生力军用两天两晚的时间劈开了一座山，跨过两口塘，飞越一条溪，迅速地铺平了十五里路长的土火车路基。一百二十个木工紧接着伐木锯材，日夜不停地铺轨，架索道，制土火车。铁工队、石工队也在山上大显神通，打铁钉、修工具、开山凿石、砌墩搭桥。一百名战士扫山、挖蔸。到1月16日止，索道架好了，土火车制成了，只见那黑色的肥土像流水一样，直向田中涌去。
