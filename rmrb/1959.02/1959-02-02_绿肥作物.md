    Green Manure Crops

    Green plants' stems and leaves that are directly turned into the fields as fertilizer are generally called green manure.

    Green manure crops are divided into cultivated and wild varieties. Cultivated green manure crops are further divided into winter-sown green manure, summer-sown green manure, aquatic green manure, and perennial green manure. Winter-sown green manure mainly includes: milk vetch, hairy vetch, yellow alfalfa, manure radish (fertilizer radish), broad beans, and peas. Summer-sown green manure mainly includes: Crotalaria juncea, Sesbania cannabina, sunn hemp, and mung beans. Aquatic green manure mainly includes: water hyacinth, alligator weed (water amaranth), and azolla. Perennial green manure includes: Amorpha fruticosa and purple alfalfa.

    Winter-sown green manure is sown in winter and harvested in spring, and is generally suitable for planting in southern regions.
