Brief News

　　Establishing Farmland Cultivation Teams

　　Yong'an County, Fujian Province, has adopted four measures to strive for bumper harvests on mountainous and distant farmlands.

　　These four measures are: organizing farmland cultivation teams with year-round fixed contract responsibility to the end, implementing quota management; preparing sufficient refined fertilizer for easy transportation; changing irrigation methods for mountain ridges and terraced fields to increase water and soil temperatures, preventing fertilizer loss; and adjusting and carefully selecting improved varieties of seeds.

　　Increasing Vegetable Production

　　The Changzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China requires all areas of the prefecture to plant vegetables on 40% of winter-fallowed fields, in addition to existing vegetable fields, to increase urban supply and improve the lives of commune members.

　　Currently, people's communes in various counties and cities are mobilizing the masses to collect seeds, vigorously build hotbeds for seedling cultivation, and actively plant vegetables. (Above according to Xinhua News Agency)

　　Extracting Gasoline from Camellia Oil Residue

　　Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County, Guangxi Province, is rich in camellia oil. In the past, more than 600,000 jin of oil residue remained after processing camellia oil each year, all of which was wasted.

　　In January of this year, employees of the Autonomous County Grain Bureau extracted gasoline from the oil residue after numerous experiments. The machine operated well in the power test using this gasoline. (According to Guangxi Daily)

　　Afforestation "Three Guarantees" Responsibility System

　　Chengping Commune in Anren County, Hunan Province, has planted more than 10,000 mu of various saplings. This year, in order to improve the quality of afforestation, after the masses' concentrated afforestation effort, this commune formed specialized teams and implemented a "three guarantees" responsibility system: guaranteeing nurturing, guaranteeing survival, and guaranteeing forest formation.
