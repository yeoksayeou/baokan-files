(Reported from Nanjing on February 3rd) One furnace ignites ten thousand furnaces, and the vast number of cadres and masses in various parts of Jiangsu Province, with heroic spirit and soaring revolutionary vigor, are rising to respond to the Yangzhong County's call for a wheat production competition. The call to learn from Yangzhong and compete with Yangzhong has resonated throughout the Yangtze River, the coast of the Yellow Sea, and the Xu-Huai Plain. A magnificent and vigorous socialist revolutionary competition movement of "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced" has rapidly and universally unfolded throughout Jiangsu Province.

In order to compete with Yangzhong County, many counties and people's communes have held mobilization rallies, radio conferences, commune member meetings, and adopted forms such as red flag competitions. Jiangdu County is holding on-site meetings on manure collection and topdressing. Upon seeing the news of Yangzhong County's initiative to launch a wheat production competition, it immediately held a radio conference to organize and mobilize the people of the county to compete with Yangzhong with redoubled efforts. More than 1,200 Party members, League members, cadres, and commune member representatives from the Satellite Commune in Yancheng County held a swearing-in meeting to ensure a bumper harvest. They boldly proposed: "With the spirit of continuous revolution, the drive to conquer dragons and tigers, the determination to overwhelm mountains and seas, and the meticulous craftsmanship, we will vigorously carry out field management," and are determined to make wheat seedlings first-class seedlings.

In the competition, various localities have conscientiously studied and analyzed their local conditions, implemented the spirit of "ten points of indicators, twelve points of measures, and twenty-four points of effort," and set out different advanced targets. Some areas with conditions similar to Yangzhong have set the same high-yield targets as Yangzhong; some areas with relatively poor conditions have set advanced targets that are several times higher than last year's with the same effort as Yangzhong. For example, Jiangyin and Changshu counties, whose conditions are similar to those of Yangzhong, are determined to surpass Yangzhong and strive to achieve a wheat yield of 1,000 jin per mu; the Yuntai Commune in Lishui County has poor soil quality, and although the wheat yield target they set is not as high as Yangzhong, it is four times higher than last year's unit area yield.

Yangzhong County's initiative has also played a role in chain competitions. Nantong Prefecture was originally competing with Yangzhong County. After seeing Yangzhong County's initiative and the news of Suzhou Prefecture striving for high wheat yields, the Prefectural Party Committee immediately convened a meeting of all commune Party committee secretaries in the prefecture. After full discussion, it was decided to carry out a friendly competition with Suzhou Prefecture. In order to deepen this competition, each county in Nantong Prefecture also found a county in Suzhou Prefecture as an object, maintained regular contact, and carried out competition. After the Rocket and Weiwu communes in Jianhu County, Yancheng Prefecture, issued an initiative for a wheat production competition to the entire prefecture, many communes stood up to respond. The Datong Commune in Sheyang County has launched a "five-comparison" and "four-competition" contest among brigades, teams, and individual commune members, comparing ideology, drive, research, creativity, and advancement, and competing for more, faster, better, and more economical.

In the competition, in order to ensure the realization of advanced targets, all localities have taken a series of specific, practical and effective measures accordingly. In order to unify the technical operating procedures for wheat field management and strengthen technical guidance, Jintan County has trained more than 37,000 technical backbones, and will train more than 12,000 people before the wheat harvest, organizing a strong team of technical backbones to ensure that various yield-increasing measures are strictly implemented in accordance with operating specifications. Cadres in Jianhu County generally eat, live, work, and consult with the masses. They loudly proposed: "Go wherever there are difficulties, and take the lead wherever no one is doing farm work." The Xincheng Commune in Danyang is close to Yangzhong County, separated only by the Yangtze River, which is more than two miles wide. The cadres and commune members of the commune often cross the river by boat to Yangzhong to visit and learn. When they see what Yangzhong has already done and they have not yet done, they immediately intensify their measures to catch up.

(Reported from Nanjing on February 3rd) The heroic 200,000 people of Yangzhong County, after issuing an initiative to Jiangsu Province for a wheat production competition, have become more and more motivated and have continuously intensified their measures, determined to hold high the red flag of striving to become a county with a wheat yield of 1,000 jin.

The initiative of Yangzhong County has been warmly responded to by the people of the province, which is a great encouragement and promotion for Yangzhong County. In the spirit of continuous revolution, the County Party Committee immediately led the entire Party and the entire people in a heated discussion on "how to strive to achieve a wheat yield of 1,000 jin per mu." Based on the opinions put forward by the masses in the discussion, the County Party Committee put forward the slogan "Wheat management to the end, efforts and measures to be intensified again," and decided to continue to add winter field management measures for wheat: In terms of topdressing, the original plan was to apply topdressing five times (four times before the Spring Festival and once after the Spring Festival), but now it has been decided to apply topdressing seven times (five times before the Spring Festival and twice after the Spring Festival); In terms of weeding, the original plan was to weed three times before and after the Spring Festival, but now it has been decided to end the second weeding before the Spring Festival, and to remove grass as soon as it is seen before jointing; resolutely lower the groundwater level by three to five feet, so that small ditches communicate with large ditches, and large ditches communicate with large rivers, and the fields are dry after the rain; make every effort to overcome diseases and insect pests, and strive for high wheat yields in every plot.

In order to implement the wheat management measures in a both vigorous and down-to-earth manner, the Yangzhong County Party Committee, in addition to deciding that each people's commune should have a County Party Committee member in charge, also transferred 240 cadres from county-level agencies, such as section and bureau chiefs, to go deep into the production brigades of the people's communes to assist the commune cadres in vigorously grasping wheat management and winter production. In the people's communes, the method of "three fixations and one reward system" was adopted, with commune cadres assigned to teams, team cadres assigned to groups, and commune members assigned to fields, and the responsibility system for field management was improved. At the same time, the county has further arranged labor, strengthened the special team for wheat management, and adopted a method of combining regular cultivation by professional teams with mass assault management to ensure that wheat gets whatever it needs and to continuously promote seedlings by looking at them.

After taking a series of measures, the wheat field management in Yangzhong County has achieved new results. In late January, 100,000 mu of wheat in the county were generally topdressed once again (a total of four times including previous topdressing), weeded once (a total of two times including previous weeding), and the ditch was cultivated once. The communes are working day and night to vigorously accumulate manure and make fertilizer, and strive to apply another general application of winter fertilizer before the Spring Festival. Commune members of the Xinba People's Commune drew up a wheat management plan for the Spring Festival the night before, and the next morning, the fields were full of people. After two days of hard work, more than 12,000 mu of wheat in the commune were generally applied with water fertilizer once, combined with weeding once. Commune and team cadres of the Xinglong People's Commune took the lead in accumulating manure and making fertilizer. 19,000 mu of wheat in the commune have been generally topdressed four times, and it is planned to apply three more times after the Spring Festival to create a high yield and win the county's wheat championship.

Now, according to the current wheat growth and topdressing situation, the Yangzhong County Party Committee is leading the masses to accumulate more fine fertilizer and apply more fine fertilizer, and requires that more than 300 local fertilizer plants in the people's communes in the county immediately put into production; vigorously develop pig raising, with 200,000 pigs kept in pens by the end of June, reaching one pig for nine fen of land.

    江苏全省卷起三麦高产竞赛  扬中人民干劲措施一再加码
    本报南京3日电　一炉点火万炉红，江苏省各地广大干部和群众，以豪迈的英雄气概和冲天的革命干劲，奋起向倡议三麦高产竞赛的扬中县应战。向扬中看齐，和扬中竞赛的应战声，响遍了长江两岸、黄海之滨和徐淮平原。一个规模壮阔的轰轰烈烈的“学先进、赶先进、超先进”的社会主义革命竞赛运动，已经迅速在江苏全省普遍展开。
    为了和扬中县展开竞赛，许多县和人民公社召开了誓师大会、广播大会、社员会议和采取了红旗竞赛等等形式。江都县正在召开积肥、追肥现场会议，一看到扬中县开展三麦高产竞赛倡议的消息，立即召开了广播大会，组织和动员全县人民以百倍干劲和扬中竞赛。盐城县卫星公社一千二百多个党团员、干部和社员代表举行确保丰收誓师大会。他们豪迈地提出：“以不断革命的精神，擒龙伏虎的干劲，排山倒海的决心，精雕细刻的功夫，大搞田间管理”，坚决要使麦苗成为一类苗。
    各地在应战中都认真地研究和分析了本地的具体条件，贯彻了十分指标、十二分措施和二十四分干劲的精神，订出了不同的先进指标。一些条件与扬中差不多的地区，都订出了与扬中同样的高产指标；一些条件较差的地区，都用与扬中同样的干劲订出比去年翻几番的先进指标。例如与扬中条件差不多的江阴、常熟两个县都决心超过扬中，力争实现三麦单产一千斤；溧水县的云台公社土质较差，他们订出的三麦产量指标，虽然赶不上扬中，但比去年的单位面积产量猛跳四倍。
    扬中县的倡议，还起了连环竞赛的作用。南通专区原来就是和扬中县竞赛的，当看到扬中县的倡议书和苏州专区力争三麦高产的消息后，地委立即召开了全专区公社党委书记会议，经过充分讨论，决定和苏州专区开展友谊竞赛。为了使这场竞赛深入开展，南通专区的各个县还在苏州专区各找一个县做对象，经常联系，开展竞赛。盐城专区建湖县火箭、威武两个公社向全专区发出三麦高产竞赛的倡议后，许多公社都挺身应战。射阳县大同公社已开展了大队与大队、小队与小队以及社员个人之间的比思想、比干劲、比钻研、比创造、比先进和赛多、赛快、赛好、赛省的“五比”“四赛”竞赛。
    各地在竞赛中，为了确保先进指标的实现，都相应地采取了一系列具体切实的有效措施。金坛县为了统一三麦田间管理操作技术规程，加强技术指导，已经训练了三万七千多个技术骨干，麦收前还要训练一万二千多人，组织一支强大的技术骨干队伍，做到每十个劳力中有一个技术员，保证严格地按照操作规格，贯彻各项增产措施。建湖县的干部普遍做到和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，他们响亮地提出：“哪里有困难就到哪里去，哪件农活没人做就到哪里去带头。”丹阳新桥公社和扬中县是近邻，只隔着二里多宽的长江，公社的干部和社员经常用小船摆渡过江去扬中参观学习，看到扬中已经做了而自己还没有做的，就马上措施加码，迎头赶上。
    本报南京3日电　英雄的扬中县二十万人民，在向江苏全省发出三麦高产竞赛倡议以后，干劲越鼓越大，措施一再加码，决心把力争成为三麦千斤县的红旗牢牢地高高地举起。
    扬中县的倡议得到了全省人民的热烈响应，这对扬中县是一个大鼓舞、大促进。县委本着不断革命的精神，立即领导全党全民对“如何力争实现三麦千斤县”展开了热烈的讨论。根据群众在讨论中提出的意见，县委提出了“三麦管理抓到底，干劲措施再加码”的口号，决定继续追加三麦冬季田间管理措施：在追肥方面，原计划追肥五次（春节前四次，春节后一次），现决定追肥七次（春节前五次，春节后两次）；在除草方面，原计划春节前后除草三次，现决定春节前结束二次除草，春节后到拔节前做到见草就除；坚决降低地下水位三尺到五尺，做到小沟通大沟，大沟通大河，雨住田干；全力战胜病虫害，力争块块三麦高产。
    扬中县委为了使三麦管理措施贯彻得既轰轰烈烈又踏踏实实，除决定每个人民公社有一个县委委员具体掌握外，还从县级机关抽调科、局长干部等二百四十人分别深入到人民公社的各个生产大队，协助公社干部，大抓三麦管理和冬季生产。在人民公社采取社干部定到队、队干部定到组、社员定到田的办法，推行“三定一奖制”，健全了田间管理责任制。同时，全县还进一步安排了劳力，加强三麦管理专门队伍，采取专业队伍经常培植与全民突击管理相结合的办法，做到三麦要什么给什么，不断看苗促进。
    在采取了一系列的措施之后，扬中县的麦田管理已经取得了新的成绩。1月下旬，全县十万亩三麦又普遍追肥一次（连前共追四次），除草一次（连前共除二次），整理墒沟一次。各公社正日夜大搞积肥造肥，争取春节前再普遍追一次腊肥。新坝人民公社社员，头天晚上订出春节前三麦管理计划，第二天一大早，就满田是人群，经过两天苦战，全社一万二千多亩三麦普遍追水粪一次，结合除草一次。兴隆人民公社社、队干部，带头积肥造肥，全社一万九千亩三麦已普遍追肥四次，春节后打算再追三次，创造高额产量，夺取全县三麦冠军。
    现在扬中县委根据当前三麦生长和追肥情况，又领导群众大积精肥，多施精肥，要求全县人民公社的三百多个土化肥厂，立即投入生产；大力发展生猪，到6月底前圈存二十万头，达到九分地一头猪。（附图片）
