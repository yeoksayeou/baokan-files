Xinhua News Agency, 13th. Recently, the Beijing Library established book exchange relationships with units such as the Belarusian State Library, the Kazakh State Library, and the Odessa National Scientific Library of the Soviet Union. To date, the Beijing Library has established book exchange relationships with fifty-two public libraries, university libraries, scientific research institutions, and publishers in the Soviet Union.

With the consolidation and development of Sino-Soviet friendship, the book exchange between the Beijing Library and Soviet libraries has been further expanded and increased. In 1958, the Beijing Library received 42,410 books and periodicals from the Soviet Union. A portion of these were newly published cutting-edge scientific books related to artificial satellites and atomic energy. These books have been of great help to China's scientific research work.

With the development of China's publishing industry, the number of books and periodicals that the Beijing Library sends to the Soviet Union has also been increasing. This year, 378 kinds of magazines were sent to the Soviet Union. In 1958, a total of 37,765 books and periodicals were sent to the Soviet Union. The Beijing Library regularly sends newly published Chinese books and recently reprinted classical books to the Soviet Union. Not long ago, the Beijing Library sent books to the Soviet Union reflecting China's great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the rural people's communes.

From 1949 to 1958, statistics show that the Beijing Library received 252,154 books from the Soviet Union. During the same period, this library sent 186,521 books to the Soviet Union.

    中苏两国图书交换频繁
    北京图书馆同苏联五十多图书馆建立关系
    新华社13日讯　最近，北京图书馆和苏联白俄罗斯国立图书馆、哈萨克国立图书馆和敖德萨国立科学图书馆等单位建立了图书交换关系。到目前止，北京图书馆已经和苏联的五十二个公共图书馆、大学图书馆、科学研究机关和出版社等建立了图书交换关系。
    随着中苏友谊的巩固与发展，北京图书馆和苏联图书馆的图书交换有了进一步的扩大和增加。1958年，北京图书馆收到了苏联寄来的书刊达四万二千四百一十册。其中一部分是新出版的有关人造卫星和原子能方面的尖端科学书籍。这些书籍对我国的科学研究工作有很大帮助。
    在我国出版事业发展的情况下，北京图书馆寄给苏联的书刊也日渐增多。今年寄往苏联的杂志有三百七十八种。1958年，共寄往苏联书刊三万七千七百六十五册。北京图书馆经常把我国新出版的书籍和新近影印的古典书籍寄给苏联。不久前北京图书馆把反映我国工农业生产大跃进和农村人民公社化的有关书籍寄给了苏联。
    从1949年到1958年的统计，北京图书馆收到苏联的书籍二十五万二千一百五十四本。同期，这个图书馆寄往苏联十八万六千五百二十一本书籍。
