Anshan, February 7th (reported by this newspaper) - February 4th, the day of the Beginning of Spring, the First Primary Rolling Mill of Angang was pulsating with the atmosphere of this spring's greater leap forward. The factory was filled with the sound of gongs and drums. On the honor roll in front of the factory gate, a large propaganda painting appeared, depicting three steel rolling workers straddling prancing steeds. The steel rolling workers were celebrating the victory of the "Ten Thousand Ton Battle" on February 3rd. On the 3rd, the daily output of the First Primary Rolling Mill broke through the ten thousand ton mark, leaping to 10,972 tons, creating a new daily output record. This daily output level is almost double the average daily output of 5,592 tons in June of last year.
	The First Primary Rolling Mill has put forward the ambitious goal of "one factory becoming two factories" this year. At the beginning of this year, the steel rolling workers started to use their brains and worked with the furnace builders to expand the hearth of the soaking pit, striving to ensure that the production of the soaking pit closely followed suit, capable of heating more steel ingots to feed the rolling mill.
	The 3rd was a day of great exercise. Starting from zero hours, the dark red steel ingots transported from the steelmaking plant were continuously loaded into the soaking pits, and then the white-hot steel ingots were quickly taken out of the furnace and sent to the rolling mill to be rolled into steel billets. The workers at the soaking pits concentrated on taking care of the furnaces, shortening the heating time for eighty-one heats of steel ingots that day by about two-thirds. The first shift in the factory smoothly rolled more than 3,500 tons. After taking over, the second shift vigorously pursued the first shift, rolling more than 3,600 tons. By the time the third shift workers were off work, they had rolled more than 3,800 tons, exceeding the records of the previous two shifts.

    鞍钢激荡着更大跃进的气氛
    本报鞍山7日电　2月4日——立春那一天，鞍钢第一初轧厂里激荡着今春更大跃进的气氛。厂里锣鼓声喧天。厂门前面的光荣榜上，出现了三个轧钢工人跨坐着骏马腾空而起的大幅宣传画。轧钢工人们正在庆祝2月3日“万吨大战”的胜利。3日，第一初轧厂日产量突破了万吨大关，猛跃到一万零九百七十二吨，创造了日产量最高纪录。这个日产量水平，比去年6月份平均日产量五千五百九十二吨的水平，几乎跃进了一倍。
    第一初轧厂今年提出了“一厂变两厂”的宏伟奋斗目标。今年一开始，轧钢工人们就开动脑筋，和筑炉工人们一起，扩大了均热炉的炉膛，力争均热炉的生产紧紧跟上去，能加热更多的钢锭，来喂饱轧钢机。
    3日是一个大演习的日子，从零时开始，由炼钢厂运来的暗红色的钢锭，不停地被装入机放进均热炉里，然后再把白热的钢锭从炉火中拑出来，飞快地送到轧钢机上去轧制钢坯。均热炉上的工人聚精会神地照料好炉子，使这一天有八十一炉钢锭的烧钢时间缩短了约三分之二。全厂第一班就顺利地轧制了三千五百多吨。第二班接班后，就猛追第一班，轧制了三千六百多吨。第三班的工人到下班时竟轧制了三千八百多吨，超过了上两班的纪录。
