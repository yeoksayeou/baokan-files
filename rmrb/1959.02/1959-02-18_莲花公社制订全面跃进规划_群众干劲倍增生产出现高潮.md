This newspaper's Lanzhou, February 17th dispatch: The Lotus People's Commune in Qin'an County, Gansu Province, has formulated an overall leap forward plan for industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries for this year.

This plan thoroughly implements the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, and simultaneously developing self-sufficient production and commodity production. After the commune realizes this plan, the average yield per mu of food crops will reach 600 jin, and the average person will have 1,600 jin of grain; the industrial output value of agricultural tool manufacturing, agricultural and sideline product processing, and other industries will reach more than 10 million yuan, and other forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries will also have great growth.

The Lotus Commune is located in the northern part of the Wei River, with high terrain, a cold climate, and drought. After last year's Great Leap Forward, the appearance here has undergone significant changes. Only the construction of mountain canals and the construction of ponds and dams to expand the irrigation area has reached more than 26,000 mu. Although it suffered from drought, floods, and pest and disease disasters last year, the total grain output still increased compared to 1957, which increased the income of the vast majority of commune members and expanded the commune's accumulation.

In order to ensure the realization of this year's leap forward targets, while giving full play to the superiority of the commune, the Party committee determined that the secretary would take the lead, divide the responsibilities, and lead production by means of competition and evaluation, on-site meetings, and grasping both ends to bring along the middle. It requires all full-time cadres to plant experimental plots, and with the spirit of continuous revolution, combine the regular production of professional teams with the blitzkrieg tactics of corps operations; organize the annual production tasks into several stages by season and with emphasis; and at the same time, fully implement the various measures of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture.

This plan has been fully discussed by the masses, and more than 1,200 revisions and supplements have been proposed, which have been added to the plan. For example, the application of 50,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of "satellite fields" was revised by the masses to 80,000 jin of fertilizer. The masses also proposed expanding the planting area of high-yield crops. Due to the mass discussion of this plan, the entire commune's production enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high.

More than 100 agricultural and sideline professional teams have been established throughout the commune, and a production upsurge of deep plowing, wheat field management, manure accumulation and delivery, and carrying ice and sweeping snow has been launched in stages. At present, 42,000 mu of land has been deep plowed, accounting for 40% of the total cultivated land area, and the general depth has reached 1.5 to 2 chi; more than 70% of the annual fertilizer requirement of 2.6 billion jin has been completed.

### 莲花公社制订全面跃进规划  群众干劲倍增生产出现高潮

    莲花公社制订全面跃进规划
    群众干劲倍增生产出现高潮
    本报兰州17日电　甘肃秦安县莲花人民公社制定出今年工、农、林、牧、副、渔的全面跃进规划。
    这个规划贯彻执行了工农业同时并举，自给性生产和商品性生产同时并举的方针。公社实现这个规划以后，粮食作物平均单产将要达到六百斤，平均每人有粮一千六百斤；农具制造，农副产品加工等工业产值将达到一千多万元，其他林、牧、副、渔都将有很大增长。
    莲花公社位于渭河北部，地势高气候寒，而且干旱。经过去年的大跃进，这里的面貌已有显著改变，仅兴修上山渠道和筑塘打坝，扩大灌溉面积即达二万六千多亩，去年虽遭旱涝和病虫灾害，粮食总产量仍比1957年增长，使绝大部分社员增加了收入，扩大了公社积累。
    公社为了保证今年跃进指标实现，在充分发挥公社优越性的同时，党委确定书记挂帅，分关把口，通过竞赛评比，现场会议，抓两头带中间来领导生产。要求脱产干部个个种试验田，并以不断革命的精神，把专业队伍经常生产和兵团作战的突击方式结合起来；把全年生产任务按季节、有重点地组织几个阶段来突击；同时要全面贯彻“八字宪法”的各项措施。
    这个规划经过群众充分讨论，先后提出的修改补充意见有一千二百条，这些意见都补充到规划里去。例如，“卫星田”亩施肥五万斤，经群众修改为施肥八万斤。群众还提出了扩大高产作物的种植面积。由于群众性的讨论这个规划，全社生产劲头空前高昂。
    全公社已建起农、副专业队一百多个，并分阶段地掀起深翻土地，麦田管理，积肥送粪，背冰扫雪的生产高潮。目前完成深翻土地有四万二千亩，占耕地总面积的40％，一般深度达到一尺五至两尺；积肥任务已完成全年需肥量二十六亿斤的70％以上。
