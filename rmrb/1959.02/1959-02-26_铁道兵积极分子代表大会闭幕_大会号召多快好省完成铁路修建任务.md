Xinhua News Agency, February 25th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army Railway Engineering Corps Activists' Representative Conference, lasting nine days, concluded today. The conference called on the entire Railway Engineering Corps to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward on this year's railway construction front.

During the conference, Chairman Mao Zedong and leading comrades of the Central Committee received all the representatives. Marshal Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense, General Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department, and Wu Jingtian, Vice Minister of Railways, addressed the conference, encouraging everyone to make greater achievements in railway construction and various tasks.

The railway construction tasks undertaken by the Railway Engineering Corps this year are more arduous and heavier than last year. In order to ensure the completion of this year's engineering tasks, the conference believes that, in addition to continuing to adhere to the principle of putting politics in command, ideology first, and fully utilizing subjective initiative, it is necessary to take rapid construction as the key and comprehensively implement the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results while ensuring safety. The conference put forward various requirements for organizing, directing, and implementing construction.

The conference believes that one of the keys to achieving a greater leap forward this year lies in further improving labor productivity. Therefore, the conference emphasized that the basic tasks of carrying out technological revolution this year are: to improve technical equipment, improve labor tools, and improve operating methods, with a focus on rapid and safe construction of tunnels and high and large bridges, vigorously developing small machinery, while intensifying machinery manufacturing and actively improving the efficiency of existing machinery, so that the degree of mechanization in various engineering constructions will be greatly improved, reducing heavy physical labor, improving labor productivity, and completing repair tasks with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. In order to push the technological revolution to a new climax, it is necessary to vigorously grasp the work of promotion. After research and appraisal with relevant professional departments, the conference decided to promote 235 advanced technologies and advanced experiences related to tunnels, bridges, railway earthwork, and mechanical operations to various units. The conference required all units to adopt the method of combining leading cadres, technical personnel, and the masses to quickly check and appraise the large number of inventions and creations that emerged last year. All those that can be adopted and promoted should be vigorously promoted in accordance with the principles of adapting to local conditions, using local materials, self-reliance, and combining indigenous and foreign methods.

Since the conference opened on the 17th of this month, a total of 54 representatives have spoken at the conference, and many other representatives have made written speeches. They widely reported on the great achievements and rich experiences gained in the great leap forward in railway construction and various tasks last year, and expressed their determination to strive to complete and overfulfill this year's greater leap forward plan.

At the closing ceremony held this afternoon, all representatives unanimously adopted a letter of proposal to all officers and soldiers of the Railway Engineering Corps, including five items: completing railway construction tasks with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, carrying out the technical revolution and the movement of being proficient in one major and capable in many fields, carrying out cultural learning, actively participating in socialist and communist studies, and carrying out the "Five Good" movement. Lieutenant General Cui Tianmin, Political Commissar of the Railway Engineering Corps, on behalf of the leading organs of the Railway Engineering Corps, awarded flags to 58 advanced units and 23 cultural companies, and issued souvenirs to all activist representatives attending the conference.

    铁道兵积极分子代表大会闭幕
    大会号召多快好省完成铁路修建任务
    新华社25日讯　中国人民解放军铁道兵积极分子代表大会历时九天，今天闭幕。大会号召铁道兵全军在今年的铁路建设战线上，为实现更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗。
    会议期间，毛泽东主席和中央负责同志接见了全体代表。国防部长彭德怀元帅、总政治部副主任萧华上将、铁道部副部长武竞天分别到会讲了话，勉励大家在铁路建设和各项工作中做出更大的成绩。
    铁道兵部队今年担任的铁路建设任务比去年更加艰巨和繁重，为了保证完成今年的工程任务，会议认为，除了继续坚持政治挂帅、思想领先、充分发挥主观能动性以外，必须以快速施工为纲，全面地贯彻多快好省并保证安全的方针。会议提出了在组织指挥施工方面的各项要求。
    会议认为，实现今年更大跃进的关键之一在于进一步提高劳动生产率，因此，会议强调指出，今年开展技术革命的基本任务是：以改善技术装备，改善劳动工具，改进操作方法，其中又以隧道、高大桥梁快速施工及安全施工为中心，大搞小型机具，同时加紧机械制造和积极提高现有机械的效率，使各项工程施工的机械化程度大大提高一步，减轻笨重体力劳动，提高劳动生产率，多快好省地完成修理任务。为了把技术革命推向新的高潮，目前要狠狠地抓推广工作。会议与有关专业部门研究、鉴定后，决定向各部队推广有关隧道、桥梁、线路土石方、机械作业等先进技术和先进经验二百三十五件。会议要求各部队采取领导干部、技术人员和群众三结合的办法，迅速检查和鉴定去年涌现的大量发明创造，凡是可以采用和推广的，要本着因地制宜、就地取材、自力更生、土洋并举的原则，大力予以推广。
    会议从本月17日开幕以来，共有五十四名代表在大会上发言，另有许多代表作了书面发言，他们广泛地汇报了去年在铁路建设和各项工作大跃进中取得的巨大成绩和丰富经验，表达了力争完成和超额完成今年更大跃进计划的决心。
    在今天下午举行的大会闭幕式上，全体代表一致通过了向铁道兵全体官兵提出的包括多快好省完成铁路修建任务、开展技术革命和一专多能运动、开展文化学习、积极参加社会主义与共产主义学习、开展五好运动等五项内容的倡议书。铁道兵政治委员崔田民中将代表铁道兵领导机关向五十八个先进单位和二十三个文化连发了奖旗，并向出席会议的全体积极分子代表发了纪念品。
