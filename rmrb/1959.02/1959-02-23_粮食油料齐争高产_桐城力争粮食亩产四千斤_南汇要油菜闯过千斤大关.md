From Hefei, this paper, February 22nd: Tongcheng County, Anhui Province, will strive to achieve a grain yield of 4,000 jin per mu for the entire county this year. This is the leap forward target set by more than 6,000 production team leaders and higher-level cadres in the county after a recent meeting to summarize the experiences of last year's bumper harvest and analyze this year's favorable conditions.

Last year, Tongcheng County achieved a bumper harvest despite encountering the most severe drought in decades. The unit area yield of grain in the county reached 1,616 jin, doubling the output of the bumper year of 1957. The cadres who participated in this meeting, after summarizing the achievements of last year's Great Leap Forward, confidently believed that such great achievements could be made last year under very unfavorable natural conditions. This year, with last year's experience, as long as we continue to mobilize the masses, liberate our minds, exert full effort, and double our measures, it is entirely possible to achieve the 4,000 jin target. At the same time, everyone summarized ten favorable conditions for organizing a greater leap forward this year: (1) The Party's general line for socialist construction has taken deep root in the hearts of the people. The continued implementation of the general line is the fundamental guarantee for realizing a greater leap forward in 1959; (2) The entire county has realized the people's commune system. The communes are large, with many people and great strength, making it easier to get things done. Moreover, after rectification and improvement, the people's communes will demonstrate even greater superiority; (3) The practice of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 by more than 500,000 people in the county. Their minds have been liberated, their ideological awareness has greatly improved, and they are full of confidence and energy; (4) The Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in 1958 trained and cultivated tens of thousands of activists and produced a large number of heroic model figures. In this year's greater leap forward, they will continue to play a backbone and core role, leading the masses forward together; (5) After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, rich experience has been accumulated in leading production and overcoming natural disasters. Continuing to apply this experience will enable us to continuously create miracles; (6) The bumper harvest in 1958 produced more than 1 billion jin of grain and more than 20,000 tons of steel. Abundant grain and money have prepared a solid material foundation for the greater leap forward in 1959; (7) This year, reservoirs, ponds, and ditches have been newly built, and water conservancy conditions are better than last year; (8) There is also more fertilizer than last year. In addition to the ongoing mass movement to accumulate and produce fertilizer, the county's green manure and local chemical fertilizer production this year are greater than last year. There are also sufficient seeds prepared this year, with good varieties and high purity; (9) This year's summer harvest crops are growing very well. If we continue to do a good job in field management in the later stages, we can fire the first shot for this year's greater leap forward in agriculture; (10) The planting schedules for all seasons in the county have been arranged early, ensuring that one season is early, and all three seasons are early, making production proactive step by step.

After analyzing these favorable conditions, the meeting studied and formulated a target of doubling and a half the grain yield per mu compared to last year. It also required a cotton yield of 200 to 230 jin per mu (lint cotton); and a total oilseed production target of 110 million to 130 million jin.

In order to achieve the above targets, the cadres attending the meeting believed that it is necessary to continue to promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. Cadres at all levels must work more deeply and meticulously, and further apply the leadership methods widely adopted in last year's Great Leap Forward, such as everyone planting experimental plots, grasping the two ends and driving the middle, holding on-the-spot meetings, and organizing labor competitions. The meeting also established six measures to ensure increased production: (1) Fertilizer takes the lead. In order to meet the needs of doubling and a half this year's grain production, each mu must apply 10,000 dan of fertilizer throughout the year (applying various fertilizers, equivalent to the fertilizer effect of 10,000 dan of miscellaneous fertilizer). (2) Continue to vigorously develop water conservancy. Build reservoirs, open canals, and vigorously carry out gravity irrigation to eliminate droughts, floods, and inundations. (3) Implement deep plowing to improve the soil. It is required that the polder and rice field areas should be deeply plowed to a depth of one chi to one chi and two cun. (4) Continue to implement close planting. On the basis of the large-scale implementation of close planting in 1958 which achieved bumper harvests, this year it is required that rice be universally promoted by planting thick seedlings with a spacing of three to four cun, sweet potatoes are planted two rows close together with intercropping, and cotton and corn should also be widened planting width and reduced row and plant spacing.
(5) Popularize good varieties. This year, it is required that early rice and late rice comprehensively promote good varieties such as "Nante No." and "Da Wan Dao."
(6) Vigorously engage in tool reform to realize transportation by vehicles and boats, semi-mechanized plowing and rice transplanting, and semi-automated water lifting. At the same time, labor should be arranged well, and a system of division of labor, fixed tasks, fixed personnel, fixed quality, fixed time, fixed measures to groups, and responsibility to individuals should be implemented.

After summarizing last year's experience, analyzing this year's favorable conditions, and formulating specific measures to increase production, the more than 6,000 cadres attending the meeting were all high-spirited and determined to resolutely fight for the realization of this year's production increase targets.

From Shanghai, this paper, February 22nd: The 50,000 mu of rapeseed in Nanhui County, Shanghai, a famous high-yield rapeseed county, is growing vigorously. Generally, each rapeseed seedling has grown eight to ten large leaves, nearly one chi high. All communes in the county are taking various measures to step up rapeseed field management and strive to achieve a rapeseed yield of 1,000 jin per mu.

In recent days, the peasants and cadres of Nanhui County have been accumulating fertilizer while applying quick-acting fertilizer to the rapeseed fields. This is the third topdressing since the rapeseed was transplanted. Each mu has already applied about 50 dan of human and animal manure and about 100 dan of river mud, exceeding last year's fertilization amount. In order to improve the quality of topdressing, experienced old peasants in various communes are conscientiously imparting topdressing techniques. Yao Yisan, an old peasant of Zhuqiao Commune who achieved a high yield of more than 700 jin of rapeseed per mu last year, patiently taught the commune members to improve the quality of topdressing. In order to ensure that rapeseed continuously obtains nutrients and produces more and larger pods, various communes will spray calcium superphosphate two to three times when the rapeseed bolts, and then apply topdressing multiple times before tipping, at the beginning of flowering, and during the pod formation period.

Simultaneous with topdressing, various communes are also actively carrying out rapeseed cultivation, soil consolidation, ditch clearing, pest control, seedling inspection and replanting activities. The county's rapeseed seedling inspection and replanting has ended after three days of concentrated effort, and the phenomenon of missing seedlings has been basically eliminated. Recently, there have been continuous overcast and rainy days, and the commune members are braving the rain to clear the furrows to ensure smooth drainage. In terms of cultivation and soil consolidation, Xinchang, Huinan, Nicheng and other communes have completed one soil loosening before February 3. After the rain stops and the weather clears, they will carry out the second soil loosening work. Various communes have also purchased large quantities of "666" powder and other pesticides, preparing to continue to carry out activities to eliminate rapeseed aphids.

Various communes have implemented a responsibility system of "special personnel managing special fields" in field management, and vigorously eliminate third-class seedlings. In a few rapeseed fields in the county, due to late planting last year and less base fertilizer, they have become third-class seedlings (accounting for about 13% of the total rapeseed planting area). In order to completely eliminate third-class seedlings, the peasants have greatly increased the topdressing of third-class seedlings and applied large amounts of nitrogen fertilizer.

Another measure to achieve overall high yield of rapeseed is that various communes are vigorously developing high-yield demonstration plots, experimental fields, and cultivating rapeseed kings in order to drive other rapeseed fields. The ten rapeseed kings cultivated by the cadres of Yaoqiao Brigade of Zhoupu Commune are now more than one chi high and three and a half chi wide around. They strive to make each rapeseed king weigh ten jin during the harvest period. Lu Xulian, the cultivator of a rapeseed king with more than 12,000 pods in Liuzao Commune last year, is now carefully cultivating twelve rapeseed kings, and he is also using the experience of cultivating rapeseed kings to guide the rapeseed production over a larger area.

Last year, Nanhui County's unit area yield of rapeseed was one of the highest in the country, with an average yield of more than 252 jin per mu, an increase of 164.8% over the previous year. This year, the rapeseed planting area has been expanded by one-third, and the experience of high yield last year is used to guide this year's rapeseed production. They seized the "early sowing, early transplanting, deep plowing, close planting, sufficient base fertilizer, high ridge and wide furrow" and other series of measures from the beginning, so that this year's rapeseed growth is stronger than last year.

    粮食油料齐争高产
    桐城力争粮食亩产四千斤
    南汇要油菜闯过千斤大关
    本报合肥22日电　安徽省桐城县今年要力争实现全县粮食亩产四千斤。这是全县六千多个生产队长以上的干部最近集会总结了去年农业大丰收的经验以后，分析了今年的有利条件定出的跃进指标。
    桐城县去年在遭遇到几十年来未有的严重旱灾的情况下，获得了大丰收。全县粮食单位面积产量达到了一千六百一十六斤，比丰收的1957年还增产了一倍。参加这个大会的干部在总结了去年大跃进的成绩以后，都满怀信心地认为，去年在自然条件很不好的情况下，还能取得这样伟大的成绩，今年有了去年的经验，只要继续发动群众，解放思想，鼓足干劲，措施加倍，争取实现四千斤指标是完全可能的。同时大家总结出今年组织更大跃进具有十大有利条件：（1）党的社会主义建设总路线已经深入人心。总路线的继续贯彻，是实现1959年更大跃进的根本保证；（2）全县实现了人民公社化，社大人多力量大，更好办事。加上人民公社在经过整顿、提高以后，它将发挥更大的优越性；（3）全县五十多万人民1958年大跃进的实践。思想得到了解放，思想觉悟有很大提高，他们信心十足，干劲充沛；（4）1958年工农业大跃进，锻炼和培养了成千上万的积极分子，涌现了大批的英雄模范人物，在今年的更大跃进中，他们将继续发挥骨干和核心作用，带领群众一起前进；（5）经过1958年的大跃进，在领导生产和战胜自然灾害等方面已经积累了丰富的经验，继续运用这些经验，就能够不断地创造奇迹；（6）1958年的大丰收，生产了十多亿斤粮食，两万多吨钢铁，粮多钱多，为1959年更大跃进准备了雄厚的物质基础；（7）今年又增修了水库、塘坝和沟渠，水利条件比去年好；（8）肥料比去年也多，除正在开展群众性的积肥造肥运动外，全县今年种的绿肥和生产的土化肥都比去年多。种籽今年也备得足，品种好，纯度高；（9）今年夏收作物生长得很好，再继续作好后期的田间管理，就能为今年农业更大跃进打响第一炮；（10）全县各季作物的茬口都已提早安排好了，一季早三季都早，使生产步步主动。
    会议在分析了这些有利条件之后，研究制订出今年粮食亩产比去年翻一番半的指标，并且要求棉花亩产二百斤到二百三十斤（皮棉）；油料总产量要求达到一亿一千万斤到一亿三千万斤。
    为实现上述指标，到会干部认为必须继续发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格。各级干部更要深入细致地工作，进一步运用去年大跃进中广泛采用的人人种试验田、抓两头带中间、开现场会、组织劳动竞赛等领导方法。会议还订出了六条保证增产的措施：（1）肥料挂帅。为适应今年粮食产量翻一番半的需要，每亩全年要下肥料一万担（施各种肥料，相当一万担杂肥的肥效）。（2）继续大兴水利。修水库、开渠网，大搞自流灌溉，消灭旱、涝、洪灾。（3）实行深耕，改良土壤。要求圩、畈地区深耕一尺到一尺二寸。（4）继续实行密植，在1958年普遍实行密植取得大丰收的基础上，今年要求水稻普遍推行三四寸粗棵密植，山芋二垅靠间作，棉花、玉米也要加宽播幅和缩小行距与株距。
  （5）普及良种，今年要求早稻晚稻全面推广“南特号”、“大晚稻”等良种。
  （6）大闹工具改革，实现运输车船化、犁田插秧半机械化、车水半自动化，同时要安排好劳动力，实行分班分业和定活、定人、定质、定时、定措施到组、责任到人的制度。
    到会的六千多个干部在总结去年经验、分析今年有利条件和拟订了具体的增产措施以后，个个斗志昂扬，决心要为实现今年的增产指标而坚决奋斗。
    本报上海22日电　著名的油菜高产县——上海市南汇县五万亩油菜生长旺盛，一般每棵油菜苗长出八到十瓣大叶，高近一尺。全县各公社正采取多种措施加紧油菜田间管理，力争实现油菜亩产千斤的指标。
    连日来，南汇县农民和干部，一边积肥，一边把速效肥料追到油菜田里，这是油菜移栽以来的第三次追肥，每亩已追人畜粪约五十担、河泥一百担左右，施肥量超过去年。为了提高追肥质量，各公社中有经验的老农民正认真传授追肥技术。去年获得油菜亩产七百多斤高产的祝桥公社老农民姚益三，耐心地教社员提高追肥质量。为了使油菜不断得到养料，使它结荚又多又大，各公社将在油菜抽苔时，喷射二次到三次过磷酸钙，在油菜打尖前、始花期和结荚期再分别多次追肥。
    与追肥同时，各公社对油菜中耕培土、清理墒沟、除虫和查苗补苗等活动也积极展开。全县油菜查苗补苗，经过三天突击，已经结束，缺苗现象已基本消灭。最近阴雨连绵，各公社社员正冒雨清理墒沟，使排水畅通。在中耕培土方面，新场、惠南、泥城等公社已在2月3日前完成一次松土，俟雨停天晴后，他们将展开第二次松土工作。各公社还大批购进六六六粉等农药，准备继续展开扑灭油菜蚜虫活动。
    各公社在田间管理方面实行了“专人专管”的责任制，并大力消灭三类苗。该县有少数油菜田由于去年下种迟，基肥少，成了三类苗（约占整个油菜种植面积13％）。农民们为了全部消灭三类苗，对三类苗追肥大加码，大施氮素肥料。
    实现油菜全面丰产的另一措施是各公社大搞丰产片、试验田和培育油菜王，以便带动其他油菜田。周浦公社姚桥大队干部培育的十棵油菜王，现在每棵油菜已高一尺多，周围阔三尺半，他们争取在收获期每棵油菜王重十斤。去年六灶公社一棵结荚一万二千多个的油菜王培育者——陆叙连，今年又正在精心培育十二棵油菜王，他还用培育油菜王的经验来指导较大面积的油菜生产。
    南汇县去年油菜单位面积产量是全国最高的县份之一，亩产平均二百五十二斤多，比前年增加164.8％。今年油菜种植面积扩大三分之一，并运用去年高产的经验来指导今年的油菜生产。他们一开头就抓紧“早播、早移栽、深耕、密植、施足基肥、高畦阔埨”等一系列措施，使今年油菜生长较去年更为壮实。　（王洪仙）
