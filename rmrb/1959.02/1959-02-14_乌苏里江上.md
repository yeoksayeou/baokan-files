On the Ussuri River
Feng Zhongliang

The Hailan steamer passed Sanjiangkou and sailed onto the Ussuri River.

The banks of the river were very quiet, presenting a scene of peace.

When our ship was still sailing on the Songhua River, our hearts had already flown to the Ussuri River. Although the ship was sailing fast, and our ship overtook the four ships in front, we still thought the ship was moving slowly. Faster! Let us see what the Soviet Union looks like sooner.

The left side of the ship's side had the most people standing, all gesticulating and shouting:

"Look, that is the Soviet Union!"

"That's a collective farm!"...

The noise was very noisy, and everyone was attracted by this novel scene. I also stood on the left side of the ship's side, looking into the distance at Soviet territory.

The border residents of the Soviet Union are more numerous than the residents living in our country's border areas. It is said that a large number of Communist Youth League members came here to develop the border areas.

At this time, gusts of cold wind blew on the river, scraping against the face like small knives. However, no one was willing to leave the ship's side, as if watching for three days and three nights would not be enough.

Suddenly, a "ho" sound came from the right side of the ship, and many people cheered. The people crowded on the left side of the ship's side squeezed to the right side of the ship's side. I also squeezed over with force. I wondered what new and strange thing it was. Ah, it turned out to be a small Soviet steamer coming to meet us. It looked like the ships were about to brush past each other. Immediately, the comrades on our ship shouted "Ura," "Ura," which they had learned from somewhere. I also shouted loudly, and our hearts seemed to fly to the Soviet elder brother's ship. Some comrades were waving their hands, some were waving their handkerchiefs, and some took off their hats and waved them in the cold wind. Because most of the people were concentrated on the right side of the ship, the navigating captain hurriedly broadcasted: "Please comrades move some to the left." However, most comrades seemed not to have heard it, and kept shouting "Ura, Ura," jumping and dancing with joy.

The elder brothers on the Soviet ship, although few in number, also shouted enthusiastically. We didn't understand Russian, but we only heard shouts coming from the river wind. Undoubtedly, the elder brothers were also cheering for us. What moved us deeply was the driver on the elder brother's ship, holding the steering wheel with one hand, his entire upper body leaning out of the driver's room, holding his hat with his hand, and shouting not very clearly, "Mao—Ze—Dong." The other elder brothers also shouted in unison: "Mao—Ze—Dong!" Our ship and the elder brother's ship had already brushed past each other, but whether it was the comrades on our Hailan or the elder brothers on the Soviet ship, they were still shouting and waving wildly.

The ship sailed naturally and calmly, but our hearts were still not calm, and our hearts were still beating. How wonderful, we saw the Soviet territory, the farm, and the Soviet elder brothers on the ship.

The Ussuri River flows calmly and meanderingly. The Hailan sails day and night, and the friendship between our Chinese and Soviet brothers flows endlessly like the river water....

    乌苏里江上
    冯忠良
    海兰号轮船驶过了三江口，船行驶在乌苏里江上了。
    江的两岸，静穆得很，呈现了一片和平景象。
    我们的船还在松花江上行驶的时候，心早就飞到了乌苏里江那儿。船尽管行驶很快，我们这只船赶过了前面的四只船，但，我们总认为船还走得慢。快点吧！让我们早点见到苏联，到底是啥样子啊。
    船舷的左边，站的人最多，都在指手划脚地嚷嚷：
    “看，那就是苏联！”
    “那是集体农庄！”……
    人声十分嘈杂，都被这新奇的景象吸引住了。我也站在船舷的左边，远眺苏联国土。
    苏联的边疆居民，比我们国家边疆住的居民多些，据说是大批共青团员来到这里开发边疆。
    这时候，江面上吹来一阵阵寒风，刮到脸上，就像一把把小刀子。可是，没有一个人舍得离开船舷，好像看三天三夜也不过瘾似的。
    突然，船舷的右边“呵”的一声，许多人欢呼起来，挤在船舷左边的人，又挤在右边船舷上来，我也使劲地挤了过来。我道是什么新奇事儿，呵，原来是苏联的一只小轮船迎着驶来了。眼看船与船要擦身而过了。顿时，我们船上的同志不知从那儿学来的苏联话：“乌拉”，“乌拉”地喊起来。我也跟着大声叫起来，我们的心好像飞到了苏联老大哥的船上。有的同志在挥手，有的拿出手绢在挥动，有的脱下了帽子，在寒风中挥动起来。由于人大部集中在船的右边，领航的船长赶忙广播：“请同志们移动些到左边去”。但，大多数同志都像未听着一样，还一直地“乌拉，乌拉”叫着，手舞足蹈地蹦跳着。
    在苏联轮船上的老大哥们，虽说人数不多，也热烈地叫起来，我们不懂俄语，只听到江风送来一阵阵的喊叫声，无疑地老大哥也在向我们叫好。使我们深为感动的还是老大哥船上的一位驾驶员，一手扶着方向舵，整个上半身都探出驾驶室外，用手扶着帽子，直喊不很清晰的“毛——泽——东”，其他的老大哥们也齐声喊：“毛——泽——东！”我们的船与老大哥的船已擦身而过了，不管是在我们海兰号上的同志或苏联船上的老大哥，还在狂喊，挥舞着。
    船自然平静的行驶着，可我们的心还不平静，心一直还跳着。多好呵，我们看到了苏联国土，农庄，轮船上的苏联老大哥。
    乌苏里江平静地流着、曲曲弯弯。海兰号日夜不停地行驶着，我们中苏弟兄的友谊像江水一样地永远也流不尽……。
