    The Sinister Hand Stirring Up Tension in Indochina
    By Our Newspaper Commentator

    Recently, the situation in the Indochina region has become tense. It is not difficult to know where the hand stirring up this tension comes from.

    The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) – an aggressive bloc controlled by the United States, announced at its headquarters in Bangkok that it would hold "large-scale air force exercises" in Thailand from March 2nd to 8th. Prior to this, from February 3rd to 6th, this group had already held a joint US-Thai army "joint atomic warfare exercise" in northern Thailand. In April, this group will also hold a large-scale naval exercise in the Far East. The United States' war-preparing machine in Asia is operating so frantically, certainly not for leisure, but harboring sinister intentions.

    The United States' choice of Thailand for these military exercises clearly shows that it is openly threatening the countries of the Indochina region with force. From the very beginning of its establishment in 1954, SEATO crudely violated the provisions of the Geneva Accords, arbitrarily designating South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia as its "protected areas." For several years, the United States has been painstakingly plotting how to drag them into SEATO, turning these places into bases for the United States to conduct military provocations against China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and other peace-loving Southeast Asian countries.

    Amidst the gunpowder of the series of exercises organized by the United States, American military personnel and various American weapons have recently been infiltrating South Vietnam and Laos on an even larger scale. In addition to further turning South Vietnam into its military base, the United States is particularly intensifying its activities in Laos. Washington's plans are reflected in the attitude of the pro-American forces in Laos. The Laotian Royal Government's statement on February 11th rejecting the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords was clearly the result of American instigation. U.S. State Department officials immediately supported this statement and stated that the United States is now free to establish a military mission in Laos. The New York Times wrote on February 13th that the Laotian statement "cleared the road" for the United States, "strengthening military cooperation between Laos and the United States will establish closer ties between Laos and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization," and "Laos is now free to participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

    It should also be mentioned that the SEATO military exercises not only play a coordinating role in this American conspiracy, but are themselves a means by which the United States attempts to link some Southeast Asian countries to this aggressive bloc. This February, when this group held army exercises in Thailand, representatives from Laos, South Vietnam, and others were invited to attend and "observe" alongside representatives from the Syngman Rhee clique and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The United States is attempting to gradually pull them into SEATO through the back door by sending delegations to participate in exercises and other means.

    Cambodia, which steadfastly pursues a policy of neutrality and national independence, is constantly subjected to crude external pressure. The Royal Government of Cambodia has recently announced in succession that it has uncovered plot after plot orchestrated by foreign countries in Bangkok to subvert the Cambodian government. The aim of these conspiracies is to attempt to use some Cambodian traitors, with funding and weapons from the Western bloc, to launch armed rebellions, subvert the legitimate Royal Government that pursues a policy of peace and neutrality, and drag Cambodia into the Southeast Asia military bloc. The Royal Government of Cambodia, with the support of the Cambodian people, is taking strong measures to quell the reactionary rebellion planned and organized by foreign countries.

    As usual, when the United States intensifies its aggressive activities in Asia, it will vigorously release the smoke screen of the so-called "international communist threat." U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Robertson's clamor on February 23rd before the Senate about the "multifaceted threat of Communist China (to the Far East)" is a recent example. However, the lies of the Robertson ilk cannot cover up the facts. Who is constantly conducting land, air, and naval exercises in Southeast Asia, brandishing their military might? Who is wantonly undermining the Geneva Accords, creating tension in Indochina, and intensifying military intervention? Who is openly carrying out armed subversion activities against nationally independent countries that pursue a policy of neutrality? It is none other than the United States.

    在印度支那煽动紧张的黑手
    本报评论员
    最近以来，印度支那地区局势趋于紧张。要知道这只煽动紧张的手来自何方，是并不困难的。
    美国控制的东南亚侵略集团设在曼谷的总部宣布，3月2日至8日，它将在泰国举行“大规模的空军演习”。在此以前，2月3日至6日，这个集团已经在泰国北部举行过一次美泰陆军“联合原子战争演习”。4月间，这个集团还要在远东举行一次大规模的海军演习。美国在亚洲的这架准备战争的机器这般紧张地开动，自然绝非闲来无事，而是包藏着祸心的。
    美国选择在泰国来进行这些军事演习，清楚地表明，它是公开地在向印度支那地区国家进行武力威胁。东南亚侵略集团在1954年成立的当初，就粗暴地违背日内瓦协议的规定，擅自把南越、老挝、柬埔寨划为它的“保护地区”。几年来，美国一直处心积虑地策划怎样把它们拖入东南亚侵略集团，把这些地方变为美国向中国、越南民主共和国和其他东南亚爱好和平国家进行军事挑衅的基地。
    在美国组织的一连串演习的火硝气中，美国的军事人员和各种美式武器近来正更大规模地渗入南越和老挝。美国除了进一步把南越变为它的军事基地外，正特别加紧对老挝的活动。华盛顿的计划反映在老挝亲美势力的态度里。老挝王国政府2月11日声明拒绝继续履行日内瓦协议，显然就是美国策动的结果。美国国务院官员立即支持这个声明，并且表示美国现在可以自由地在老挝设立一个军事使团了。“纽约时报”2月13日写道，老挝声明给美国“扫清了道路”，“加强老挝同美国的军事合作将使老挝同东南亚条约组织建立更紧密的联系”，“老挝现在可以自由地参加东南亚条约组织了”。
    还需要提到的是，东南亚集团军事演习不仅对美国这种阴谋起着配合作用，而且它本身也是美国企图把一些东南亚国家同这个侵略集团连结起来的一个手段。今年2月，这个集团在泰国举行陆军演习时，老挝、南越等代表受邀同李承晚集团和蒋介石集团代表一道到场“观察”。美国正是企图用派代表团参加演习等方式，把它们一步步地从后门拉进东南亚集团。
    坚定地奉行中立和民族独立政策的柬埔寨，正在不断受到外来的粗暴压力。柬埔寨王国政府最近接连宣布，破获了外国在曼谷策划的一个又一个颠复柬埔寨政府的阴谋。这些阴谋的目标是企图利用柬埔寨一些叛徒，拿着西方集团的经费和武器发动武装叛乱，颠复奉行和平中立政策的合法的王国政府，把柬埔寨拖进东南亚军事集团。柬埔寨王国政府在柬埔寨人民支持下，正在采取有力的措施来平定由外国策划和组织的反动叛乱。
    照例，美国自己在亚洲加紧侵略活动的时候，它便要使劲施放所谓“国际共产主义威胁”的烟幕。美国负责远东事务助理国务卿罗伯逊2月23日在参议院作证时又叫嚷什么“共产党中国（对远东）的多方面威胁”，就是最近的一个例子。但是，罗伯逊之流的说谎是掩盖不了事实的。谁在东南亚耀武扬威地不断进行陆空海军演习呢？谁在肆无忌惮地破坏日内瓦协议，在印度支那制造紧张局势，加紧搞军事干涉呢？谁在明目张胆对奉行中立政策的民族独立国家进行武装颠复活动呢？这不是别人，正是美国。
