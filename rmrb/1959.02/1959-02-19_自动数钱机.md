    Automatic Money Counting Machine
    Wu Baoman, a staff member of the Anshan Branch of the People's Bank of China, recently successfully created a photoelectric-controlled "all-purpose automatic money counting machine." After formal inspection, this automatic money counting machine can count 10,000 banknotes per hour. Each teller can operate three machines simultaneously, which is five times more efficient than manual counting. This photoelectric automatic control can also be used to check product quality in textile, paper making, and printing industrial production processes.

    自动数钱机
    中国人民银行鞍山分行工作人员武保满，最近创制成功一台光电控制的“全能自动点钞机”。经过正式检验，这台自动点钞机每小时能点一万张钞票，每个出纳员可同时操纵三台，比一般人工点钞效率高出五倍。这种光电自动控制，还能用在纺织、造纸、印刷工业生产过程中检查产品质量等。
