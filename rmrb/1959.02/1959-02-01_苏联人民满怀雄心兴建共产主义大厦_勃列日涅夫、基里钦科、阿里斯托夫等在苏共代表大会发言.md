Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 30th. The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued its session in the Grand Kremlin Palace at 4:00 PM (Moscow time) today to discuss Comrade Khrushchev's report.

At the afternoon session, the first speaker was Academician Lavrentiev, Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and Director of the Siberian Branch of the Academy of Sciences. He spoke about the tasks that the Seven-Year Plan set for Soviet science and scientists. He said that Soviet science has achieved world leadership in all key departments and will achieve leapfrog development in the Seven-Year Plan. He said that scientific institutions, universities, industry, and agriculture should be as close as possible to each other, both organizationally and geographically, and that cooperation between universities, technical schools, and factories must be strengthened. New science centers are now being established, and this cooperation is very important. It has already guaranteed the achievements of Soviet science in nuclear physics and other fields.

Lavrentiev, on behalf of Siberian scientists, assured the Congress that the scientists would do everything in their power to ensure that the scientific tasks of the Seven-Year Plan could be completed.

Comrade Brezhnev, a member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, then spoke. He said that the 21st Congress of our Party will be recorded in history as a brilliant milestone, marking the entry of our socialist motherland into the period of building a communist society.

Brezhnev pointed out that the measures taken by our Party in many sectors of the national economy in recent times have tapped the enormous potential of domestic industry and agriculture. Life itself shows how the Party has improved ideologically and organizationally, and how the cadres have been tempered by revolution.

He continued, saying that during the Seven-Year Plan, heavy industry plays a leading role in building the material and technical foundation of communism. He emphasized that prioritizing the development of heavy industry was, and still is, our unshakable general line. Investment in heavy industry is nearly 700 billion rubles. The chemical, power, oil and gas, and building materials industries will see great development.

Brezhnev then discussed in detail the development of metallurgical production in the next seven years.

Brezhnev said that the Seven-Year Plan for the metallurgical industry and other sectors of the national economy can not only be completed but also overfulfilled, and the enthusiasm of the Soviet people is a guarantee of achieving this. He emphasized that the honor of building the magnificent and brilliant communist mansion first in world history has fallen on the Soviet people.

Ryabakova, a fitter at the Moscow Tire Factory, said in her speech that the new tasks facing the Soviet state require new methods to solve them. For example, within the tire factory, it is entirely possible to greatly increase the output of tires on the same production area.

Lomako, Chairman of the Krasnoyarsk (Siberia) National Economic Council, emphasized in his speech at the Congress that the Soviet Union's tremendous achievements in industry are due to the fundamental reorganization of the leadership of industry and the establishment of national economic councils in economic regions throughout the country. In the short period since the establishment of the National Economic Council, the enormous superiority of this form of economic management has been demonstrated.

Lomako, in explaining the Seven-Year Plan for the development of the frontier region's industry, pointed out that the needs of various industrial sectors that are significant to the entire national economy were taken into account when formulating this plan.

Bauko, Chairman of the Lenin Collective Farm in Poltava Oblast (Ukraine), introduced to the delegates of the Congress the achievements of the farm's workers in increasing the yield per unit area of agricultural products and developing animal husbandry.

He also requested Comrade Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, who was attending the Congress, to convey the respect of all members of the farm (all of whom are members of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association) to the Chinese working people.

Next, Ville Pessi, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Finnish Communist Party, delivered a congratulatory speech to the Congress.

Dolores Ibárruri, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party, also delivered a congratulatory speech at the afternoon session.

The afternoon session also announced that the Congress had received congratulatory telegrams from fraternal parties such as Portugal, Cyprus, Sudan, and Turkey.

The meeting announced that the oil workers of Tatar (Middle Volga) reported in a congratulatory telegram to the Congress that they had discovered new oilfields that are of great significance for the development of this extremely important oil-producing region of the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 31st. The 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued its session in the Grand Kremlin Palace at 10:00 AM (Moscow time) today, continuing to discuss Khrushchev's report.

The first speaker at the morning session was Mustafayev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan Communist Party. He said that Azerbaijan is ready to fulfill the tasks set out in the control figures of the Seven-Year Plan. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the total industrial output of the Azerbaijan Republic will increase by about 93%. He pointed out that Azerbaijan's achievements and development prospects illustrate how the Soviet minorities have achieved prosperity and happiness under the leadership of the Communist Party.

Mustafayev emphasized that the people of Azerbaijan hope to live in friendship with their close neighbors—Iran and Turkey. He said that there is an Eastern proverb: A distant relative is not as good as a close neighbor. Our neighbors should know that we only want them to be well.

Kirichenko, a member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, said in his speech that the 21st Party Congress is a milestone in our country's journey to a new and higher stage of development, and a milestone in the start of a comprehensive construction of a communist society. In the past five years, especially since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Soviet Union has reached such a peak that from this peak, we can see the vast and grand prospects for our country's Seven-Year Plan.

Kirichenko condemned the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov. Kirichenko pointed out that as soon as Stalin passed away, they began to attack everything new that proceeded from Leninist doctrines and from the demands of national life at every meeting of the Presidium of the Central Committee.

Kirichenko continued, saying that the participants in the anti-Party group were mired for a long time in the quagmire of conservatism. They only played with words from the works of Marxist-Leninist classics, while they themselves were far removed from life and from the people. Kirichenko emphasized that it should be said directly that the crushing of the anti-Party group was a great victory for our Party in the struggle to implement the Leninist line.

Kirichenko emphasized the importance of the measures to reorganize the management forms of industry and construction, as well as the Central Committee's measures on the rapid development of agriculture. He also talked about the selection, deployment, and training of cadres.

Kirichenko said that the 20th Party Congress opened a new period in the life of party organizations at all levels throughout the country. He then talked about the work of activating the party's grassroots organizations and strengthening the party's ties with the masses. He said that one of the proofs of the close ties between the party and the people is that the masses widely discussed various major suggestions concerning the further development of the national economy and culture. Enterprise leaders, advanced production workers, and experts in industry and agriculture are often invited to attend meetings of the Central Committee.

Kirichenko emphasized that communist ideas attract the people of all countries with their truth.

Kirichenko then talked about the rapid development of the communist and workers' movements in various countries, the growing strength of fraternal communist and workers' parties, and the continuous growth of the ranks of revolutionary youth in capitalist countries. He said that communism is the spring of mankind, and the ideas of communism are surging like a spring tide in all countries of the world.

Kirichenko concluded by saying that there is no doubt that the 21st Party Congress will unanimously approve the program of Soviet communist construction.

Balashkin, a steelworker at the Minsk Automobile Factory, pointed out in his speech that the Communist Party members and all the workers of their factory unanimously approve of the control figures for the development of the national economy. He made a personal guarantee at the meeting to overfulfill the steelmaking plan.

Miralshnikov, Minister of Agriculture of the Russian Federation Bureau of the CPSU Central Committee, spoke about the agricultural development of the Russian Federation. He emphasized that the measures taken by the Soviet Union in developing agricultural production after the 20th Congress of the CPSU will help to complete the 1959-1965 plan.

Severo Aguirre, Chairman of the National Committee of the People's Socialist Party of Cuba, delivered a congratulatory speech to the Congress. He received a warm welcome from the delegates when he appeared on the stage.

Aristov, a member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, said in his speech that the vitality and realism of the Seven-Year Plan lie in the fact that it was formulated with the participation of the entire Soviet people, and it embodies the rich experience accumulated by the Party over the years. He said that Comrade Khrushchev's report clearly depicted the outline of the magnificent communist mansion.

Aristov compared the growth rate of Soviet industrial products with that of the United States. He said that since the Soviet Union began implementing the first few five-year plans, due to the much higher growth rate of industry than that of the United States, the Soviet Union has been shortening its distance from the United States in production level year by year.

Aristov said that on the eve of the implementation of our Seven-Year Plan, the growth rate of Soviet industrial product production exceeded that of the United States by eight and a half times. The planning of the Seven-Year Plan shows that from 1913 to 1965, the growth rate of the Soviet Union was about twelve times higher than that of the United States. This is what makes American monopoly capitalists uneasy. These figures show how the strength of the socialist system is growing year by year, and the socialist system is far superior to the capitalist system. After seeing these facts, what is the value of the so-called slowdown in the Soviet Union's development speed?

Aristov continued, saying that in terms of natural mineral reserves, we are richer than any country in the capitalist world. The Soviet Union ranks first in the world in thirteen of the sixteen most important minerals.

Aristov emphasized that the reason why Soviet scientists, engineers, and workers were able to achieve success in manufacturing artificial earth satellites and launching space rockets is because here, such problems are not solved by individual inventors but by the entire collective. He said that we will continue to study the mysteries of the universe. This is something that socialist countries can do. He added that this is also a good form of competition. Let the capitalists catch up with us.

Aristov continued, saying that we should also calmly see that the United States has made significant achievements in science, technology, and certain economic sectors. However, we will certainly surpass the United States, and by then, the working people of capitalist countries will dispel the last doubts—which system is more perfect, socialism or capitalism.

Aristov also cited some specific figures and facts to illustrate the smooth work of the National Economic Council of the Russian Federation. He said that these situations prove how correct the Party's resolution on reforming the management of industry and construction is.

Aristov said that now the Soviet Union has moved ahead in the peaceful use of atomic energy, aircraft manufacturing, rocket technology, and other fields. Our task is to strive to achieve the first place in some important economic sectors such as the machinery manufacturing industry. We master the achievements of foreign scientific and technical personnel in order to use creative labor to design new machines and to achieve new progress in the development of technology.

Aristov emphasized the need to bring science and scientific research institutions closer to production. He also said that in order to promote technological progress, there must be a large number of party members who are proficient in and love technology, and new young cadres should be promoted to leadership positions.

Kamalov, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Uzbekistan Communist Party, said at the Congress that the grand plan for the Soviet Union's development of the national economy is based on the solid foundation of the achievements of the Soviet Union.

He continued, saying that in recent years, the power of various union republics in economic and cultural construction has been greatly expanded. This helps to further consolidate the fraternal cooperation and friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet Union.

Kamalov cited some materials to prove the improvement of Uzbekistan's productivity and the development of industry and agriculture. He said that the historically significant achievements of the Uzbekistan people have been praised by our friends. The enemies of the Soviet Union are trying to depreciate these achievements. However, no matter what they say, the Uzbekistan people are advancing on the road to happiness and on the road to communism. The Uzbekistan people hope to live in peace with the people of all countries in the world.

Kamalov said that the Communist Party members and all the working people of Uzbekistan are determined to complete the Seven-Year Plan.

After Kamalov's speech, five hundred Young Pioneers entered the venue. These children presented flowers to the members of the Presidium of the Congress and the representatives of the fraternal communist and workers' parties, and put the red scarves of the Young Pioneers on them. At this time, there was warm applause throughout the venue.

The morning session ended here.

    苏联人民满怀雄心兴建共产主义大厦
    勃列日涅夫、基里钦科、阿里斯托夫等在苏共代表大会发言
    新华社莫斯科30日电　苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会今天下午四时（莫斯科时间）继续在大克里姆林宫开会，讨论赫鲁晓夫同志报告。
    在下午会议上，第一个发言的是苏联科学院副院长、科学院西伯利亚总分院院长拉夫连捷夫院士。他谈到了七年计划向苏联科学和科学家提出的任务。他说，苏联科学在一切首要部门都获得了世界首位，在七年计划中还要得到飞跃发展。他说，应当使科学机关、高等学校、工业和农业尽可能相互接近，使它们在组织上和地点上接近，还必须加强大学、技术学校和工厂的合作。现在新的科学中心正在建立起来，这种合作是非常重要的。它已经保证了苏联科学在核物理学方面的成就和其他的成就。
    拉夫连捷夫代表西伯利亚科学家向大会保证说，科学家们将尽自己的一切力量使七年计划在科学方面的任务能够完成。
    苏共中央主席团委员勃列日涅夫接着发言。他说，我们党的第二十一次代表大会将作为一个光辉的里程碑载入史册，这个里程碑标志着我们社会主义的祖国进入共产主义社会建设时期。
    勃列日涅夫指出，最近时期我们党在国民经济许多部门所采取的措施挖掘了国内工农业巨大的潜力。生活本身表明，党在思想上和组织上有了怎样的提高，干部得到了怎样的革命锻炼。
    他接着说，七年计划时期在建立共产主义的物质技术基础时，重工业起着主导作用。他强调指出，优先发展重工业过去是，现在仍然是我们不可动摇的总路线。投入重工业的资金差不多达七千亿卢布。化学、动力工业、石油和瓦斯工业、建筑材料工业要获得很大发展。
    勃列日涅夫接着详细地谈到今后七年冶金业生产的发展。
    勃列日涅夫说，冶金业和其他国民经济部门的七年计划不仅可以完成，而且可以超额完成，苏联人的热情是达到这一点的保证。他着重说，在世界历史上第一个建立起光辉灿烂的共产主义大厦的荣誉落到了苏联人的身上。
    莫斯科轮胎厂钳工雷巴科娃在发言中说，苏维埃国家面临的新任务，要求用新的方法来解决它们。例如，在轮胎厂内，完全有可能在同样的生产面积上大大提高轮胎的产量。
    克拉斯诺雅尔斯克（西伯利亚）国民经济委员会主席洛马科在大会发言中强调指出，苏联在工业方面之所以取得了巨大的成就是由于根本改组了对工业的领导并在全国各地经济区建立了国民经济委员会。在国民经济委员会成立后的短短时期内，已经显示了这种管理经济的形式的巨大优越性。
    洛马科在说明发展边疆区工业的七年计划时指出，在制定这个计划时，曾照顾到对全国整个国民经济具有意义的各工业部门的需要。
    波尔塔发州（乌克兰）列宁集体农庄主席鲍科向代表大会的代表们介绍了他们农庄的劳动者在提高农产品单位面积产量和发展畜牧业方面的成就。
    他还请求出席这次代表大会的中国共产党中央委员会副主席周恩来同志，转达农庄全体庄员（他们都是苏中友好协会会员）对中国劳动人民的敬意。
    接着，芬兰共产党中央委员会总书记维勒·培西向代表大会致贺词。
    在下午会议上致贺词的还有西班牙共产党中央委员会总书记伊巴露丽。
    今天下午会议还宣布，大会已经收到了葡萄牙、塞浦路斯、苏丹、土耳其等兄弟党给代表大会的贺电。
    会议宣布，鞑靼（伏尔加中游）的石油工人在给代表大会的贺电中报告说，他们发现了对发展苏联这个极重要的采油区具有重大意义的新的油矿区。
    新华社莫斯科31日电　苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会今天上午十时（莫斯科时间）继续在大克里姆林宫举行会议，继续讨论赫鲁晓夫的报告。
    在上午会议上首先发言的是阿塞拜疆共产党中央委员会第一书记穆斯塔法耶夫。他说，阿塞拜疆已为实现七年计划的控制数字中提出的任务作好准备。到七年计划结束时，阿塞拜疆共和国工业总产值将增加93％左右。他指出，阿塞拜疆的成就和发展远景说明苏联少数民族在共产党领导下是怎样获得繁荣和幸福的。
    穆斯塔法耶夫强调指出，阿塞拜疆人民希望同自己的近邻——伊朗和土耳其友好相处。他说，东方有一句谚语：远亲不如近邻。我们的邻居应该知道，我们只是希望他们好。
    苏共中央主席团委员、苏共中央书记基里钦科在会上发言说，第二十一次党代表大会是我国开始走上新的更高的发展阶段的里程碑，是开始转入全面开展共产主义社会建设的里程碑。在过去五年，特别是在苏共第二十次代表大会以后，苏联已登上了这样一座高峰，从这座高峰上可以看到我国发展七年计划的辽阔而宏伟的远景。
    基里钦科谴责了马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、布尔加宁和谢皮洛夫反党集团。基里钦科指出，斯大林刚一逝世，他们就开始在中央委员会主席团的每一次会议上攻击从列宁主义学说和从国家生活要求出发的一切新事物。
    基里钦科接着说，反党集团的参与者长久地陷入保守主义的泥潭中。他们只玩弄马克思列宁主义经典作家著作中的词句，而自己却远远地脱离生活和脱离人民。基里钦科强调指出，应当直截了当地说，反党集团的被粉碎是我们党在为贯彻列宁主义路线的斗争中的巨大胜利。
    基里钦科强调指出，改组工业和建筑业的管理形式的措施以及中央委员会关于急剧发展农业的措施的重要意义。他还谈到了干部的挑选、配备和培养的问题。
    基里钦科说，党的第二十次代表大会在全国各级党组织生活中打开了一个新的时期。他接着谈到了活跃党的基层组织和加强党同群众联系的工作情况。他说，党同人民的密切联系的证明之一是，群众广泛讨论了有关进一步发展国民经济和文化的各项重大建议。企业领导人、先进生产工作者和工农业专家常常被邀请参加中央委员会的会议。
    基里钦科强调指出，共产主义思想以自己的真理吸引着各国人民。
    基里钦科接着谈到了共产主义运动和工人运动在各国迅速发展、各兄弟共产党和工人党日益壮大以及在资本主义国家中革命青年队伍不断壮大的情况。他说，共产主义是人类的春天，而共产主义的思想犹如春潮一样在世界各国汹涌澎湃。
    基里钦科最后说，毫无疑问，第二十一次党代表大会将一致批准苏联共产主义建设的纲领。
    明斯克汽车工厂炼钢工人巴拉什金在发言中指出，他们工厂的共产党员和全体工人一致赞同发展国民经济的控制数字。他在会上提出了他个人超额完成炼钢计划的保证。
    苏共中央俄罗斯联邦局农业部部长米拉尔什柯夫在发言中谈到俄罗斯联邦农业发展的问题。他着重指出，在苏共第二十次代表大会以后，苏联在发展农业生产方面所采取的措施将有助于1959—1965年计划的完成。
    古巴人民社会党全国委员会主席西维罗·阿吉雷向大会致贺词。他在讲台上出现时，受到了代表们热烈欢迎。
    苏共中央主席团委员阿里斯托夫在发言时说，七年计划的生命力和现实性在于它是在全体苏联人民的参与下拟订的，它体现了党历年来所积累的丰富经验。他说，赫鲁晓夫同志的报告中清楚地描绘了共产主义宏伟大厦的轮廓。
    阿里斯托夫把苏联工业产品增长的速度同美国作了比较。他说，从苏联实现头几个五年计划开始，由于工业增长速度比美国高得多，苏联在生产水平上一年年地缩短了它同美国的距离。
    阿里斯托夫说，在我们七年计划开始执行的前夕，苏联工业产品生产增长的速度超过了美国八倍半。七年计划的规划表明，从1913年到1965年这一时期，苏联的增长速度比美国要高十二倍左右。这是使美国垄断资本家感到不安的事。这些数字表明，社会主义制度的力量是如何年年不断地增长，社会主义制度要比资本主义制度优越得多。看了这些事实以后，关于所谓苏联发展速度减慢的说法又有什么价值呢？
    阿里斯托夫接着说，就天然矿产蕴藏量来讲，我们比资本主义世界任何一个国家都丰富。十六种最重要的矿产中有十三种是苏联占世界第一位。
    阿里斯托夫强调指出，苏联科学家、工程师和工人所以能够在制造人造地球卫星和发射宇宙火箭方面获得成就，是因为在我们这里，这样的问题不是由个别发明家、而是由整个的集体来解决的。他说，我们将继续研究宇宙的奥秘。这一点是社会主义国家能够胜任的。他补充说，这也是一种很好的竞赛形式。让资本家们追赶我们吧。
    阿里斯托夫接着说，我们也应该冷静地看到，美国在科学、技术和某些经济部门取得了重大的成就。然而我们一定会超过美国，到那时，资本主义国家的劳动人民将消失最后的疑问——哪个制度更完善，是社会主义还是资本主义。
    阿里斯托夫还举出一些具体数字和事实，说明俄罗斯联邦国民经济委员会的顺利的工作。他说，这些情况证明，党的关于改组工业和建筑业管理的决议是多么正确。
    阿里斯托夫说，现在苏联在和平利用原子能、飞机制造、火箭技术以及其他方面已经走到前面去了。我们的任务是要争取在机器制造业这样一些重要的经济部门也取得第一位。我们掌握外国科学技术人员的成就，是为了用创造性的劳动来设计新机器，来取得发展技术的新进步。
    阿里斯托夫强调必须使科学和科学研究机构接近生产。他还说，为了促进技术进步，党内必须有大量精通和热爱技术的工作人员，应该提拔新的青年干部担任领导工作。
    乌兹别克共产党中央委员会第一书记卡马洛夫在大会上发言说，苏联发展国民经济的宏伟计划是以苏联取得的成就作为坚固的基础的。
    他接着说，在最近几年内，各加盟共和国在经济和文化建设方面的权力大大扩大了。这有助于进一步巩固苏联各民族的兄弟合作和友谊。
    卡马洛夫举出了一些材料来证明乌兹别克生产力的提高和工农业的发展。他说，乌兹别克人民具有历史意义的成就得到我们朋友的称赞。苏联的敌人企图贬低这些成就。但是，不管他们怎么说，乌兹别克人民正在幸福的道路上、共产主义的道路上前进。乌兹别克人民希望同世界各国人民和平相处。
    卡马洛夫说，乌兹别克的共产党员和全体劳动人民满怀决心来完成七年计划。
    卡马洛夫发言后，五百名少先队员走进会场。这些小朋友将鲜花献给代表大会主席团委员们和各兄弟共产党和工人党代表们，并且给他们带上了少先队的红领巾。这时，全场热烈鼓掌。
    上午会议至此结束。
