    On the Question of Capitalist Economic Crisis
    Different Views of Foreign Progressive Economists on Capitalist Economic Crisis

    Since the outbreak of the American economic crisis in 1957, progressive economists abroad have held many symposiums and published numerous articles, elaborating on their views on this crisis, and some new arguments have also emerged. Judging from the published articles and symposium records, their basic viewpoints are consistent, but there are still different views on several key issues.

    This discussion began in early 1958 with the publication of the Soviet economist Varga's article "Post-War Cycle Problems and the New Economic Crisis of Overproduction". During the past year, there have been several relatively concentrated discussions, such as the special discussion on Varga's article jointly convened by the Department of Economics, Philosophy and Law of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Institute of World Economy and International Relations on April 29. The Soviet journals "International Life" and "New Times" also published the main speeches of two symposiums on the post-war economic situation of capitalist countries. The Fourteen-Nation Economists Conference held at Humboldt University in Berlin in early October also discussed this issue. In the meantime, many famous scholars published articles.

    The main issues of this debate are three: the views on the current American economic crisis; the world industrial cycle problem; and whether a global economic crisis will occur at present.

    Regarding the first issue, Varga and Manukyan and others argued that this crisis is a cyclical crisis of overproduction, more profound and lasting than the previous post-war crises of overproduction, and the beginning of a world crisis of overproduction, but not necessarily more profound and lasting than the 1929-1933 crisis. Bechin, however, believes it will be more profound and serious than the 1929 crisis. Participants at the "International Life" symposium also believed it was an economic crisis, not a short-term production stagnation, but no one explicitly pointed out that it was a cyclical crisis of overproduction, and Kuzminov even believed it might be an intermediate crisis that preludes a cyclical crisis. At the "New Times" symposium, all progressive British and American economists admitted that this was a cyclical economic crisis. Pello also considered it a crisis of overproduction in an article he wrote. Hyman Lumer, in a report he made, also believed that another crisis of the same scale as 1929 was possible.

    The second issue includes the impact of the war on cyclical development and the question of when the cycle begins. Varga believed that the normal cycle process of capitalist reproduction was interrupted during the war, and the post-war industrial cycle began in 1947 (due to the year and a half it took to reorganize the economy from wartime to peacetime). Maslennikov believes that the cycle should begin in 1949 or 1950, because most capitalist countries restored their pre-war production levels at this time. At the symposium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Khronorod believed that the war played the role of a crisis, and the new cycle started during the war. Varga and Arzumanyan both opposed this view, but Arzumanyan also disagreed with Varga's point that the cycle was interrupted during the war. In his concluding remarks at the "International Life" symposium, Kuzminov argued that the war played the role of a crisis for European countries, but played the role of a boom phase for the United States, resulting in the destruction of the unity and commonality of the world cycle. He and Vygodsky both believed that the production decline from 1943-1946 was a real crisis of overproduction, so the world cycle should begin after this crisis. Mendelson expressed his disagreement with the view that the cyclical laws had ceased to be effective during the war at the Fourteen-Nation Economists Conference in Berlin, but he also disagreed with the view that the war had the function of a crisis. He believed that the war was only an abnormal cycle, not an interruption of the cycle. He also put forward a new argument: the typical cycle form formed in the nineteenth century has been eliminated by the war, and the post-war form is mainly a military inflationary crisis. Polish economist Sokolov opposed this view, believing that this concept of crisis is too general, and the crisis referred to by Marxism is only a crisis of overproduction.

    Regarding the third issue, Marxist economists are almost unanimously affirmative, but the arguments are not the same, and there are even more different views on whether a world economic crisis has occurred. Those who believe that a world economic crisis has already begun include Varga and Arzumanyan of the Soviet Union, and Clout of France. Kuzminov, Manukyan, and most other progressive economists argue that the conditions are ripe, that the American crisis has the possibility of developing into a world crisis, and that it now exhibits the characteristics of the arrival of a world economic crisis. Mendelson believes that it is still difficult to determine whether the current American crisis has a world nature, and it can be recognized as the starting point of the first general crisis of overproduction after the war; Orlov believes that there is an obvious world crisis in the raw materials and shipping industries, but this has special circumstances, so it cannot be said that the world economic crisis has already begun.

    This discussion is still ongoing.

    International Economists Conference Held in Berlin
    Discussing the Economic Situation of Modern Capitalist Countries

    From October 1st to 4th, 1958, Marxist economists from fourteen countries including the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, France, Italy, and Germany gathered at Humboldt University in Berlin to discuss the economic situation of modern capitalist countries, including post-war cycles, crises, and the conditions of the working class. During the four-day session, four economists made reports, and twenty attendees spoke at the discussion. The discussion on the following two issues is briefly introduced below:

    On the Question of Capitalist Economic Crisis and Cycles

    Soviet representative Professor Mendelson gave a report at the meeting, in which he analyzed the impact of war on the laws of cycles and crises. He believes that it is difficult to agree with the statement that the capitalist cycle law has lost its effect during the war. He said that capitalist economic laws that temporarily lose their effect have not existed in the past and will not exist in the future. War is only a special abnormality of the law. In his report, he said that the current crisis in the United States has opened the prelude to the first general world crisis of overproduction after the war. On the whole, the entire capitalism is moving towards a general world cyclical crisis of overproduction. Professor Schmidt of the German Democratic Republic said in his report that the West German economy, starting from the post-war depression, after the post-war recovery from 1948 to 1950 and the prosperity from 1950 to 1957, has entered a cyclical crisis in 1958. The signs of the crisis are manifested in the following aspects: 1. The growth rate of industrial production is deteriorating; 2. Insufficient load of production equipment; 3. Reduced orders; 4. Reduced exports; 5. Growth of commodity inventory; 6. Reduction of basic construction projects; 7. Increased unemployment; 8. Overproduction of agricultural products. According to the signs, the crisis is not far from turning into a leap forward development. Italian economist Bezingi pointed out in the discussion that one of the characteristics of this crisis is that industrial product prices are rising even when production is declining, while agricultural product prices and industrial product prices in the non-monopoly sector are falling. Polish Professor Sokolov disagreed with including underproduction, war, etc. in the concept of crisis. He believes that the crisis is capitalist obesity, and it can only be a crisis of overproduction; war is not a special cyclical phenomenon, but a manifestation of capitalist disintegration. Soviet Professor Figurnov believes that large-scale wars can interrupt cyclicality, but they can also create economic conditions for crisis, that is, a new cycle. Professor Altmann of the German Democratic Republic believes that the period between 1945 and 1947 was not a period of depression in West Germany, because a crisis of overproduction had not occurred before this. He believes that this period had all the characteristics of a crisis, so the post-war cycle in West Germany also started from the crisis.

    On the Question of the Conditions of the Working Class in Capitalist Countries

    The vast majority of economists believe that the role of the laws of absolute pauperization and relative pauperization is fully preserved under modern capitalist conditions. They believe that absolute pauperization cannot be expressed by an indicator like relative pauperization, but should include many indicators determined by workers' working and living conditions, such as labor intensity, unemployment impact, crisis, war, etc. The most distinctive sign of absolute pauperization is the proportional relationship between real wages and the value of labor power. The real wages of workers are generally declining, which is primarily due to the continuous decline in the value of labor power along with technological progress and the increase in labor productivity. Dutch economist Nieuvalainen and Belgian economist Reye put forward a new view on this law. They believe that it is dogmatic to regard the long-term decline of real wages as the main sign of pauperization. They disagreed with the statement that this law works anytime and anywhere. However, their opinions were criticized at the meeting.

    关于资本主义经济危机问题
    国外进步经济学家
    对资本主义经济危机的不同看法
    自从美国经济危机在1957年爆发以来，国外进步的经济学家开过多次座谈会，发表了不少文章，阐述对这次危机的看法，也出现了一些新论点。从已发表的文章和座谈记录看，他们的基本观点虽是一致的，但在若干关键性问题上，也还存在不同的看法。
    这次讨论是从1958年初，苏联著名经济学家瓦尔加发表了他的“战后周期问题和新的生产过剩经济危机”一文开始的。去年一年中有过几次比较集中的讨论，如4月29日苏联科学院经济、哲学和法律科学学部和世界经济与国际关系研究所共同召开了关于瓦尔加文章的专题讨论，苏联“国际生活”、“新时代”也分别发表了两次关于资本主义国家战后经济情况讨论会的主要发言。10月初由柏林洪堡大学召开的十四国经济学家会议上也讨论了这个问题。其间不少著名学者发表了文章。
    这次争论的主要问题有三个：对目前美国经济危机的看法；世界工业周期问题；目前会不会发生世界性经济危机。
    关于第一个问题，瓦尔加和马努基扬等人主张这次危机是周期性的生产过剩危机，比战后前几次生产过剩危机更深刻更持久，而且是世界生产过剩危机的开始，但不一定比1929—1933年的危机更深刻和持久。别钦则认为将比1929年的危机更深刻更严重。“国际生活”座谈会的与会者也都认为是经济危机，而不是短期的生产停滞，但无人明确指出它是周期性的生产过剩危机，库兹明诺夫甚至认为可能是周期性危机前奏的中间性危机。在“新时代”的座谈会上，所有英美进步经济学家都承认这是一次周期性的经济危机。佩洛在他写的一篇文章中也认为是生产过剩危机。希曼·拉默在他作的一次报告中还认为再发生一次和1929年规模相同的危机也是可能的。
    第二个问题，包括大战对周期发展的影响，和周期从什么时候开始的问题。瓦尔加认为，资本主义再生产的正常周期进程，在战时发生了中断，战后工业周期开始于1947年（由于从战时到平时的经济改组用了一年半的时间）。马斯连尼科夫认为，周期应从1949或1950年开始，因为资本主义国家大多在这个时候恢复了战前的生产水平。在苏联科学院的座谈会上，克隆洛德则认为战争起着危机的作用，新周期从战时就开始了。瓦尔加和阿尔祖马宁都反对这种看法，但阿尔祖马宁也不同意瓦尔加的周期在战时中断的论点。库兹明诺夫在“国际生活”的座谈会的总结发言中主张，大战对欧洲各国起了危机的作用，对美国却起了高涨阶段的作用，结果破坏了世界周期的统一性和周期的共同性。他和魏戈斯基都认为1943—1946年生产下降是真正的生产过剩危机，所以世界周期应从这次危机后开始。蒙德尔逊在柏林十四国经济学家会议上表示不同意战时周期规律已停止发生效用的看法，但也不同意战争具有危机的职能的看法。他认为战争只是周期的变态，而不是周期的中断。他并提出了一个新论点：十九世纪形成的典型周期形式已为战争所消灭，战后的形式主要是军事通货膨胀危机。波兰经济学家索科洛夫反对这种说法，认为这个危机概念太普泛，而马克思主义所指的危机只是生产过剩的危机。
    关于第三个问题，马克思主义经济学家差不多是一致肯定的，不过论据并不相同，而对于世界经济危机已否发生，则更有不同看法。认为目前已开始世界经济危机的有苏联的瓦尔加、阿尔祖马宁，法国的克劳特等。主张条件已成熟，美国的危机有发展为世界危机的可能，并且现在已呈现世界经济危机到来的特征的，有库兹明诺夫、马努基扬和其他大多数进步经济学家。蒙德尔逊则认为目前还难以断定美国这次危机具有世界性质，可以认定是战后第一次普遍生产过剩危机的起点；奥洛夫则认为在原料和航运业方面明显存在着世界性危机，但这有特殊情况，因此不能说世界经济危机已经开始。
    这次讨论仍在继续中。
    在柏林召开的国际经济学家会议
    讨论现代资本主义国家的经济状况
    1958年10月1日到4日，苏、波、捷、法、意、德等十四个国家的马克思主义经济学家，在柏林的洪堡大学集会，讨论了现代资本主义国家的经济状况，其中包括战后周期、危机和工人阶级状况等问题。四天会期中，有四位经济学家作了报告，二十个出席者在讨论会上发了言。现将有关以下两个问题的讨论情况简介如下：
    关于资本主义经济危机和周期问题
    苏联代表蒙德尔逊教授在会上作了报告，他分析了战争对周期和危机规律作用的影响。他认为，说在战时资本主义周期规律已失去作用是难以同意的。他说，暂时失去作用的资本主义经济规律过去没有今后也不会有。战争只是规律的特殊变态。他在报告中说，美国目前的危机已为战后第一个世界生产过剩总危机揭开了序幕，总的看来，整个资本主义正在向着世界周期性生产过剩总危机行进。民主德国施密特教授在报告里说，西德的经济从战后的萧条开始，经过1948—1950年的战后复苏和1950—1957年的繁荣后，已于1958年进入了周期性危机。危机的迹象表现在这几方面：一、工业生产增长速度每况愈下；二、生产设备负荷不足；三、定货减少；四、出口额减少；五、商品库存增长；六、基本建设工程量减少；七、失业增加；八、农产品生产过剩。根据迹象表明，危机转向飞跃发展已为期不远。意大利经济学家贝真吉在讨论时指出，这次危机的特点之一是：工业品价格甚至在生产下降情况下也是上升的，而农产品和非垄断部门的工业品价格却在跌落。波兰的索科洛夫教授不同意把生产不足、战争等包括在危机的概念里，他认为危机是资本主义的肥大症，它只能是生产过剩危机；战争并不是什么特殊的周期现象，而是资本主义瓦解的表现。苏联费古尔诺夫教授认为大规模战争能够冲断周期性，但它同时也能给危机、即新的周期创造经济条件。民主德国阿尔特曼教授认为，1945—1947年间并不是西德的萧条时期，因为在这以前并没有发生过生产过剩危机。他认为，这个时期具备了危机的一切特点，所以西德的战后周期也是从危机开始的。
    关于资本主义国家工人阶级状况问题
    绝大多数经济学家认为，在现代资本主义条件下，绝对贫困化和相对贫困化规律的作用完全保存了下来。他们认为，绝对贫困化不能像相对贫困化那样可以用一个指标来表示，而应该包含由工人劳动条件和生活条件所决定的许多指标，如劳动强度、失业影响、危机、战争等。绝对贫困化的最鲜明的标志，就是实际工资同劳动力价值的比例关系。工人的实际工资总的说来是下降的，这首先是由于劳动力价值伴随着技术进步和劳动生产率的提高而不断下降。荷兰经济学家涅瓦莱年和比利时经济学家瑞耶对这个规律提出了一个新的看法。他们认为把实际工资的长期下降看成是贫困化的主要标志是教条主义。他们不同意这个规律在任何时候任何地方都起作用的说法。但他们的这些意见在会上受到了批评。
