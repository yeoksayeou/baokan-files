The Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, Phoui Sananikone, issued a statement on February 11, unilaterally claiming that the Kingdom of Laos had completed its obligations under the Geneva Accords and no longer had any obligation to abide by them. He also opposed the resumption of activities by the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, which oversees the implementation of the Geneva Accords, and declared that the Kingdom of Laos does not recognize the arbitration of any international organization other than the United Nations. This is a serious act by the Kingdom of Laos, under the instigation and support of U.S. imperialism, to flagrantly undermine the Geneva Accords and attempt to completely overturn the Lao-related sections of the Geneva Accords. Peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia is under threat. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, Chen Yi, issued a statement on February 18, solemnly declaring the attitude of the Government of the People's Republic of China towards this issue.

Sananikone's claim that the Kingdom of Laos has completed its obligations under the Geneva Accords is untenable. As everyone knows, the political settlement stipulated in Article 14 of the "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos" has not yet been achieved; some issues related to Article 15, such as not retaliating against or discriminating against former resistance members and guaranteeing their democratic freedoms, have not been resolved. Not only has the Lao Royal Government not fully fulfilled its responsibilities under these clauses of the Geneva Accords, but many clauses of the Geneva Accords have also been continuously violated by the Lao Royal Government. In fact, the Lao Royal Government is still intensifying its retaliation and discrimination against former resistance members, and even using various means to cruelly persecute them. This is a blatant violation of Article 15 of the Geneva Accords. Articles 4 and 5 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference clearly stipulate that the Lao government must not accept foreign aid regarding military materials, personnel, and instructors; must not participate in military alliances; and must not establish bases on its territory for foreign military forces. The Lao Royal Government guaranteed in its statement at the Geneva Conference that it "is determined never to participate in aggressive policies and will never allow Lao territory to be used to serve such policies." However, the Lao Royal Government has abandoned its responsibilities under the Geneva Accords and willingly accepted a series of U.S. military intervention activities in Laos, seriously hindering and undermining the full implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos. Therefore, the truth is not that the Lao Royal Government has completed its responsibilities under the Geneva Accords, but that many aspects of the Geneva Accords have been continuously and brutally violated by the Lao Royal Government. It is not that the Lao Royal Government is no longer bound by the Geneva Accords, but precisely that it must earnestly fulfill the obligations stipulated by the Geneva Accords.

This action by the Lao Royal Government is inseparable from the conspiracy and planning of U.S. imperialism to deliberately tear up the Geneva Accords. Recently, the U.S. military intervention activities in Laos have become more frequent and blatant. According to Western news agency reports, U.S. interventionists brazenly transported 82 Filipinos employed by the U.S. government at Clark Air Base in the Philippines to Laos to supplement the U.S. air bases there, and illegally provided the Lao government with a large number of weapons and ammunition. The United States is stepping up the construction of strategic highways in Laos and building airports for U.S. military aircraft to use. The Chief of Staff of the Lao Army, Ratthikone, under the instructions of the United States, publicly clamored that Laos is within the "defense" scope of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and demanded that the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc intervene in the Vietnam-Laos border dispute in an attempt to introduce the military forces of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc into Laos. When the United States and Thailand held military exercises in northern Thailand from February 3 to 6, the Lao Royal Government actually sent a delegation to participate along with Taiwan, South Vietnam, and South Korea. U.S. Pacific Commander-in-Chief Harry Felt recently visited Laos. This series of actions by the United States, which openly violates its promises regarding the Geneva Accords and colludes with the Lao authorities to conduct military intervention in Laos, has created a new tense situation in Indochina. The day after Sananikone issued a statement tearing up the Geneva Accords, on February 12, the U.S. State Department immediately issued a statement to support it. The U.S. State Department also publicly stated that the United States is now "free" to establish a military mission in Laos, which further clearly exposes that this serious act by the Lao Royal Government to flagrantly undermine the Geneva Accords and openly refuse to fulfill its international responsibilities is instigated and supported by the United States and is part of the U.S.'s recent conspiracy to intensify military intervention in Indochina and Southeast Asia and create a tense situation.

In order to undermine and even fundamentally abandon the Geneva Accords, Sananikone openly opposed the resumption of activities by the International Commission in Laos. However, he could not provide any legitimate basis for this. On the contrary, shortly before his statement was issued, the two co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, clearly affirmed the legal status of the International Commission in Laos and the authority of the commission in performing the tasks and responsibilities stipulated in the Geneva Accords in a letter to the Indian government on January 31 this year. The two chairmen also unanimously believed that the current suspension of activities of the International Commission in Laos is only a procedural decision and does not involve the repeal of any clauses related to the International Commission in the "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos." Therefore, the legitimate authority of the International Commission in Laos to supervise the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos is unshakable.

Moreover, precisely because the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos is facing serious threats and sabotage today, it is even more necessary and urgent for the International Commission to resume its duties. All activities of the International Commission in Laos are to supervise the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos, and there is no question of interfering in internal affairs at all. Sananikone insisted that the International Commission interfered in Laos' internal affairs, which is a distortion of the facts and a reversal of right and wrong. In his statement, Sananikone, on the one hand, attempted to overturn the Geneva Accords and deny the International Commission, and on the other hand, brought out the United Nations, which further exposed that his purpose was only to pave the way for the United States to use the United Nations to further interfere in Laos and Indochina. However, everyone knows that the Geneva Accords are a solemn international treaty reached by the countries concerned outside the United Nations in a situation where the United Nations was unable to fairly resolve the Indochina peace issue due to the manipulation of the United States. The nine signatory countries of the Geneva Conference bear the responsibility for supervising the full implementation of the agreement, which has nothing to do with the United Nations.

It must also be pointed out that recent developments show that the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek gang's armed forces operating in Burma and Laos are colluding with the United States and the Lao Royal side, and are ready to make trouble. U.S. aircraft have been continuously airdropping food and weapons to the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek gang in this area, and have therefore repeatedly violated our country's airspace. The Lao Royal side has also signed a secret agreement with these remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek gang and agreed to the establishment of a consulate by the Chiang Kai-shek gang in Vientiane. This is a deliberate provocation and extremely unfriendly act by the Lao Royal Government towards the Chinese people.

The facts are very clear. The United States and the Lao government are attempting to use the so-called Lao fulfillment of the Geneva Accords as an excuse to obstruct and undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords, and also to open the door for the United States to openly interfere in Laos' internal affairs and enslave the Lao people, and turn Laos into a U.S. base in order to carry out military provocations against China, Vietnam, and other Southeast Asian countries, and create a tense situation in Indochina and Asia. This is extremely dangerous. This perverse act by the Lao authorities is of no benefit to the Lao people and the Kingdom of Laos. It not only seriously endangers Laos' national independence, domestic unity, and peaceful life, but also poses a serious threat to the peace and security of Southeast Asian countries, especially Indochina. The Geneva Accords are the foundation of peace and security in Indochina. The implementation of the Geneva Accords on the Lao issue is not only related to the peace, unification, and independence of Laos, but also to the peace and security of the entire Indochina and Southeast Asia. The people of all countries who are concerned about peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia cannot turn a blind eye to this aggressive conspiracy and intervention activities of the United States. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on February 15, pointing out that the Kingdom of Laos has the responsibility to fulfill the Geneva Accords, which has been supported by all countries and people who are concerned about peace and security in this region.

China is a participant in the Geneva Conference and a neighbor of Laos. The Chinese people cannot but express serious concern about the U.S. imperialist's open instigation and support of the Lao Royal Government to abandon the Geneva Accords, create a tense situation in Laos, and undermine peace in Indochina. The Chinese people firmly believe that the Geneva Accords must be fully implemented and must not be undermined or abandoned. The Lao Royal Government is fully bound by the Geneva Accords, and it has the complete and inescapable responsibility and obligation to seriously and fully fulfill the various decisions of the Geneva Accords related to the Lao issue.

The current situation in Laos is serious. All those who are concerned about peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia should take necessary actions. As stated in the statement of Foreign Minister Chen Yi, all participating countries of the Geneva Conference, especially the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, as chairmen of the Geneva Conference, as well as the member states participating in the Indochina International Commission and all countries and people who are concerned about and safeguard peace in Southeast Asia, should immediately take action to maintain the Geneva Accords and resolutely oppose and stop the U.S.'s conspiracy to conduct military intervention in Laos and Indochina and create a tense situation; the Lao International Commission should immediately resume its activities; supervise and stop the U.S. and Lao governments from undermining the Geneva Accords, so that the current serious situation in Laos can be eased and peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia can be maintained and consolidated.

### 日内瓦协议不容撕毁

    日内瓦协议不容撕毁
    老挝王国首相培·萨纳尼空2月11日发表声明，片面声称老挝王国已经完成履行日内瓦协议的责任，已再无遵守日内瓦协议的义务，并且反对监督日内瓦协议实施的老挝国际委员会恢复活动，声称老挝王国不承认联合国以外的任何国际组织的仲裁。这是老挝王国在美帝国主义指使和支持下悍然破坏日内瓦协议，企图将日内瓦协议有关老挝部分全盘推翻的严重行为。印度支那和东南亚的和平正受到威胁。我国外交部陈毅部长已于2月18日发表声明，严正地申明中华人民共和国政府对于这个问题的态度。
    萨纳尼空的声明中所谓老挝王国已经完成履行日内瓦协议的责任的说法是根本站不住脚的。大家知道，“关于在老挝停止敌对行动的协定”第十四条规定的政治解决还没有实现；同第十五条规定有关的对前抗战人员不加报复和歧视并保障其民主自由的一些问题还没有得到解决。不仅老挝王国政府对于日内瓦协议的这些条款的责任没有完全履行，而且
  日内瓦协议的许多条款还遭到老挝王国政府的不断破坏。事实上，老挝王国政府至今还在变本加厉地对前抗战人员实行报复和歧视，甚至使用种种手段对他们进行残酷的迫害。这是对于日内瓦协议第十五条的公然破坏。日内瓦会议最后宣言第四条和第五条明确规定，老挝政府不得接受关于军事物资、人员和教官的外国援助；不得参加军事同盟和在本国的领土上为外国军事力量建立基地。老挝王国政府在日内瓦会议的声明中保证：“决心永不参与侵略政策，并永不允许老挝的领土被利用来为此种政策服务”。但是，老挝王国政府却背弃了它对日内瓦协议所承担的责任，甘心接受美国对老挝的一系列的军事干涉活动，使日内瓦协议在老挝的全部实施严重地遭到阻挠和破坏。因此，事实上绝不是老挝王国政府对于日内瓦协议的责任已经完成履行，而是日内瓦协议的许多方面不断遭到老挝王国政府的粗暴破坏，不是老挝王国政府可以不再受日内瓦协议的约束，而正是它必须认真履行日内瓦协议所规定的义务。
    老挝王国政府的这种行动是同美帝国主义蓄意撕毁日内瓦协议的阴谋策划分不开的。最近一个时期以来，美国对老挝的军事干涉活动更加频繁，更加露骨。据西方通讯社报道，美国干涉者明目张胆地把美国政府在菲律宾克拉克空军基地雇用的八十二名菲律宾人运到了老挝，来充实美国在那里的空军基地，并且向老挝政府非法提供大量武器和弹药。美国在老挝加紧修筑战略公路，修筑飞机场供美国军用飞机使用。老挝陆军参谋长拉提曲耳在美国的授意下，公然叫嚷老挝是在东南亚侵略集团的“防御”范围之内，要求东南亚侵略集团干涉越南—老挝边境纠纷事件，企图借此把东南亚侵略集团的军事力量引入老挝。美国和泰国于2月3日至6日在泰国北部地区举行军事演习的时候，老挝王国政府竟同台湾、南越和南朝鲜一起派了代表团参加。太平洋美军总司令哈里·费尔特上将最近曾到老挝进行活动。美国这一系列公然违反自己关于日内瓦协议的诺言、勾结老挝当局对老挝进行军事干涉的行动，形成了印度支那的新的紧张局势。就在萨纳尼空发表撕毁日内瓦协议的声明的第二天，2月12日，美国国务院立刻发表声明加以支持。美国国务院并且公然表示美国现在可以“自由地”在老挝设立一个军事使团，这就更加清楚地暴露了，老挝王国政府这一悍然破坏日内瓦协议、公开拒绝履行它所承担的国际责任的严重行为，是受到美国的指使和支持的，是美国最近在印度支那和东南亚加紧军事干涉，制造紧张局势的阴谋活动的一部分。
    萨纳尼空为了破坏乃至根本毁弃日内瓦协议，竟公开反对老挝国际委员会恢复活动。但是，他却提不出任何合法的根据。相反地，就在他的声明发表前不久，日内瓦会议两位主席，苏联和英国，在今年1月31日给印度政府的信里还曾经明确肯定老挝国际委员会的法律地位和委员会在执行日内瓦协议所规定的任务和职责方面的权限。两位主席并且一致认为老挝国际委员会目前的停止活动只是一种程序性的决定，毫不涉及废止“关于在老挝停止敌对行动的协定”中有关国际委员会的任何条款。因此，老挝国际委员会对日内瓦协议在老挝的实施进行监督的合法职权是不可动摇的。
    而且，正因为今天日内瓦协议在老挝的实施遭到严重的威胁和破坏，国际委员会恢复执行职责就更为必要和迫切了。老挝国际委员会的全部活动都是为了监督日内瓦协议在老挝的实施，根本不发生什么干涉内政的问题。萨纳尼空硬说国际委员会干涉老挝内政，这是歪曲事实，颠倒是非。萨纳尼空在声明中一方面企图推翻日内瓦协议，否认国际委员会，另一方面却抬出什么联合国来，这就更加暴露了他的目的只不过是要想为美国利用联合国进一步干涉老挝和印度支那开辟道路。但是，谁都知道，日内瓦协议是在联合国由于美国的操纵而无力公正地解决印度支那和平问题的情况下，由有关国家在联合国之外达成的庄严的国际条约，日内瓦会议九个签字国负有监督协议全部实施的责任，同联合国毫不相干。
    还必须指出，最近的情况表明，在缅甸、老挝境内活动的蒋介石集团残余武装同美国和老挝王国方面正在相互勾结，蠢蠢欲动。美国飞机不断在这一地区向蒋介石集团残余分子空投粮食和武器，并且因此多次侵犯我国领空。老挝王国方面还同这些蒋介石集团残余分子订立了秘密协定，并且同意蒋介石集团在万象设立领事馆。这是老挝王国政府对中国人民的蓄意挑衅和极不友好的行为。
    事实非常清楚，美国和老挝政府企图以所谓老挝已经履行日内瓦协议为借口来阻挠和破坏日内瓦协议的实施，也是为美国公开干涉老挝内政和奴役老挝人民打开方便之门，并把老挝变成美国的基地，以便向中国、越南和其他东南亚国家进行军事挑衅，在印度支那和亚洲制造紧张局势。这是极端危险的。老挝当局这种倒行逆施的行为对于老挝人民和老挝王国是没有任何好处的，它不但严重危害了老挝的民族独立与国内的团结和和平生活，而且给东南亚首先是印度支那各国的和平与安全带来了严重的威胁。日内瓦协议是印度支那和平和安全的基础。关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的实施，不仅关系到老挝的和平、统一和独立，而且也关系到整个印度支那和东南亚的和平和安全。一切关心印度支那和东南亚地区和平的各国人民，对美国的这种侵略阴谋和干涉活动，不能熟视无睹。越南民主共和国政府在2月15日发表声明，指出老挝王国有责任履行日内瓦协议，得到了所有关心这个地区的和平和安全的国家和人民的支持。
    中国是日内瓦会议的参加国，同时是老挝的邻邦。中国人民对于美帝国主义公然策动和支持老挝王国政府毁弃日内瓦协议，在老挝制造紧张局势，破坏印度支那和平，不能不表示严重的关切。中国人民坚决认为，日内瓦协议必须全部实施，不容破坏毁弃。老挝王国政府完全受日内瓦协议的约束，它有完全的、不可逃避的责任和义务，来严肃而完满地履行日内瓦协议有关老挝问题的各项决定。
    目前老挝的局势是严重的。一切关心印度支那和东南亚和平的人们都应当采取必要的行动，正如陈毅外交部长的声明中所说的，所有日内瓦会议参加国，首先是作为日内瓦会议主席的苏联和英国，以及参加印度支那国际委员会的成员国和一切关心和维护东南亚和平的国家和人民，应该立即行动起来，维护日内瓦协议，坚决反对和制止美国在老挝和印度支那进行军事干涉、制造紧张局势的阴谋活动；老挝国际委员会应该立即恢复活动；监察和制止美国和老挝政府破坏日内瓦协议的活动，使老挝目前的严重局势得到和缓，印度支那和东南亚地区的和平得到保持和巩固。
