Chinese Writers Mao Dun and Others Issue Statement
Demanding Immediate Release of Faiz by Pakistani Authorities

(Reported by this newspaper) The twenty-six Chinese writers who attended the Tashkent Asian-African Writers Conference and the Delhi Asian Writers Conference, including Mao Dun, Zhou Yang, Ba Jin, and Lao She, jointly issued a statement on the 18th, protesting the Pakistani authorities' unreasonable arrest of the poet Faiz, and demanding his immediate release. The full text of the statement is as follows:

We, the participants of the Tashkent Asian-African Writers Conference and the Delhi Asian Writers Conference, have recently learned that Faiz Ahmed Faiz, the outstanding poet of Pakistan, has been arrested by the Pakistani authorities. This news has shocked and outraged us.

The writers among us who participated in the Tashkent Conference had just said goodbye to our colleague and friend, and he was thrown into a dark prison as soon as he returned to his own country. Faiz is a loyal son and staunch fighter of the people of his country. In March 1951, Faiz was arrested for the so-called "Rawalpindi Conspiracy Case" and was not released until April 1955. In prison, Faiz could not even get the necessary paper and pens, but this did not prevent him from writing brilliant poems dedicated to the people of his country with the blood of his soul. He has contributed to his country and people, and he is loved by the people; only those who hate the people hate him.

When Faiz visited China in 1956 as an envoy of the Pakistani people, many of our writers met him. Since then, Faiz's poems have been more widely spread among our people. The lofty feelings expressed in Faiz's poems and his yearning for ideals and light deeply infected us; his condemnation of autocracy and darkness and his firm belief in the people's cause inspired us.

Faiz participated in the Asian Writers Conference held in Delhi in 1956 and the Asian-African Writers Conference held in Tashkent last year. At these two meetings, he played a good role in promoting and consolidating the solidarity among Asian and African writers. He is a close brother and friend of Asian and African writers.

Faiz is a loyal comrade-in-arms of the African people. Anyone who has read his poem "Come Back, Africa!" dedicated to the African warriors will feel and understand his deep concern for the African people.

Faiz is an outstanding social activist of the Pakistani people and one of the fighters standing at the forefront of Pakistan's struggle for independence, democracy, and peace. Shortly after the start of World War II, Faiz wrote his famous poem "Only a Few Days Left" with an angry heart. In the poem, he told people that the rule of imperialism had only a few days left. His poem inspired the people to rise up against the tyrants riding on their heads. Faiz played an active role in the world peace movement.

We cannot tolerate the Pakistani authorities putting Faiz in prison. We express our protest to the Pakistani authorities for unreasonably arresting Faiz and firmly demand: immediate release of Faiz!

### 我国作家茅盾等发表声明  要求巴当局立即释放费兹

    我国作家茅盾等发表声明
    要求巴当局立即释放费兹
    本报讯　中国出席塔什干亚非作家会议和德里亚洲作家会议的作家茅盾、周扬、巴金、老舍等二十六人，18日联名发表声明，抗议巴基斯坦当局逮捕诗人费兹的无理行动，并要求立即释放费兹。声明全文如下：
    我们，塔什干亚非作家会议和德里亚洲作家会议的参加者，最近获悉：巴基斯坦的卓越诗人费兹·阿哈默德·费兹被巴基斯坦当局逮捕了。这个消息，使我们万分震惊和愤慨。
    我们中间的参加塔什干会议的作家刚刚与我们这位同行和朋友告了别，而他刚刚回到他自己的祖国，就被投入了黑暗的牢狱。费兹是他的祖国人民的忠实儿子和坚强不屈的战士。1951年3月，费兹就因所谓“拉瓦尔品第阴谋案”被捕过。至1955年4月才被释放。在监狱中，费兹连必要的纸和笔也得不到，但是这并不能阻挡他用自己心灵的血液，写出效忠于自己祖国人民的光辉诗篇。他是有功于他的祖国和人民的，他得到人民的热爱，只有仇恨人民的人才仇恨他。
    当费兹在1956年作为巴基斯坦人民的使者来访问中国的时候，我们许多作家便认识了他。从那时起，费兹的诗篇便在我国人民中间得到了更广泛的传播。费兹在他的诗中所表现的崇高感情和对于理想和光明的渴望深深感染着我们；他那对专制和黑暗的咀咒以及对人民事业的坚强信念鼓舞着我们。
    费兹参加了1956年在德里举行的亚洲作家会议和去年在塔什干召开的亚非作家会议。在这两次会议上，他对促进和巩固亚非作家之间的团结起了良好作用。他是亚非作家亲密的兄弟和朋友。
    费兹是非洲人民的忠实战友。只要读过他的“回来呀，非洲！”这一献给非洲战士们的诗篇的人，便会感觉和了解到他对非洲人民怀着多么深切关怀的激情。
    费兹是巴基斯坦人民的杰出的社会活动家，是站在巴基斯坦争取独立、民主、和平最前列的战士之一。在第二次世界大战开始后不久，费兹以愤怒的心情写了他的名诗“只有几天了”。在诗中，他告诉人们，帝国主义的统治只有几天了，他的诗鼓舞了人民起来反对骑在他们头上的强暴者，费兹在世界和平运动中起了积极的作用。
    我们不能容忍巴基斯坦当局把费兹投入监狱。我们向无理逮捕费兹的巴基斯坦当局表示我们的抗议，并且坚决要求：立即释放费兹！
