Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 15th: According to a report from the Delhi correspondent of the Indian "Blitz" weekly to TASS, the recent military coups in some Southeast Asian countries are the result of a secret plan promoted by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles to launch an offensive against democracy in Asian countries.

According to reports, in a report submitted by Dulles to U.S. President Eisenhower in September 1957 regarding the formulation of this "plan," he expressed great concern about the growing dissatisfaction with American policies in Asian countries, particularly in member states of the Manila Pact. The report stated that despite the United States providing substantial economic, military, and spiritual support to the Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan, the situation in these countries has greatly intensified since the establishment of this military bloc.

Dulles strongly argued in the report that while the regimes in some Southeast Asian countries had not yet been consolidated, efforts should be made to establish dictatorial regimes in these countries to "stabilize" them, and the heads of these dictatorial regimes should be "tough figures" who would obey the United States. Dulles' intention was to first establish dictatorial regimes in countries participating in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Subsequently, neutral Asian countries should also implement this "reform." The plan proposed by Dulles, aimed at opposing the independence of Asian countries and instigating military coups in certain Asian countries, was called the "New Road for Asia."

    印度“闪电”周报揭露 
    东南亚一些国家军事政变都同杜勒斯阴谋计划有关
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社德里14日讯：据印度“闪电”周报驻华盛顿特派记者报道，最近在东南亚一些国家中发生的军事政变，是美国国务卿杜勒斯推行他所制定的对亚洲国家的民主发动进攻的秘密计划的结果。
    据报道，1957年9月杜勒斯向美国总统艾森豪威尔提出的关于制定这一“计划”的报告中，对美国政策在亚洲国家，特别是在马尼拉条约的成员国日益遭到不满的这一情况表示十分担心。报告中说，尽管美国给菲律宾、泰国和巴基斯坦大量的经济、军事和精神上的支持，但是自从这个军事集团成立以来，这些国家的局势却大大尖锐化了。
    杜勒斯在报告中坚决主张，乘东南亚一些国家的政权还没有巩固的时候，应当设法在这些国家中建立独裁政权，来“稳定”它们，而这些独裁政权的首脑应该是听命于美国的“强硬人物”。杜勒斯的打算是：首先应该在参加东南亚条约组织的各国中建立独裁政权。随后，亚洲的中立国家也应该实行这种“改革”。杜勒斯提出的这种目的在于反对亚洲国家的独立和引起某些亚洲国家的军事政变的计划，被称为“亚洲的新道路”。
