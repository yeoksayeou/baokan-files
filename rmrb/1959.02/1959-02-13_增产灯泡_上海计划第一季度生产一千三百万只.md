Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 12th. The Shanghai Telecommunications and Electrical Appliance Industry Company recently organized a group of factories to increase the production of various industrial and civil lighting bulbs. It is planned to produce more than 13 million bulbs in the first quarter.

Shanghai has several factories manufacturing industrial and civil lighting bulbs, with a large annual output. Last year, while withdrawing equipment and training a group of workers to support Hangzhou, Bengbu, Changzhou and other places, they also successfully trial-produced 13 new products, creating technical conditions for batch manufacturing of advanced precision products. This year, while these factories are trial-producing and producing precision and cutting-edge products, they have also expanded the production of daily-needed bulbs to meet the needs of the people's lives. The Ya’er Bulb Factory is preparing to install four new sets of machines this year, increasing the annual output of bulbs to 40 million. The remaining batch of small bulb factories are also preparing to improve the degree of mechanization and automation, and to improve bulb production a step further.

    增产灯泡 
    上海计划第一季度生产一千三百万只
    新华社上海12日电　上海电讯电器工业公司最近组织一批工厂增产各种工业用和民用的照明灯泡。计划第一季度生产灯泡一千三百万只以上。
    上海有好几家工厂制造工业用和民用的照明灯泡，年产量很大。去年，他们在抽出设备和培养一批工人支援杭州、蚌埠、常州等地的同时，还先后试制成功十三种新产品，为成批制造高级精密产品创造了技术条件。今年，这些工厂一边试制和生产精密、尖端产品，一边扩大了日常需用灯泡的生产，满足人民生活需要。亚浦尔灯泡厂今年准备新安装四套机器，使灯泡的年产量增加到四千万只。其余一批小型灯泡厂也准备提高机械化、自动化的程度，把灯泡的生产提高一步。
