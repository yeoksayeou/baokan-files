Speech by Jean-Paul Sande at the Beijing Rally in Support of the Cameroonian People's Struggle

Dear Friends:

First of all, on behalf of the Cameroonian people who are struggling for unification and national independence, I extend to you brotherly greetings. The Cameroonian people are especially honored because the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee and the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs have invited their only and loyal vanguard—the Cameroonian People's Union—to attend this grand gathering. It is difficult to express in words the feelings of a struggling people when our people receive the support of the great Chinese people, especially when I see such a grand support activity here, and it is even more difficult for me, as their representative here, to express this excitement. We understand the great Chinese people, their great history and resolute struggle, and their revolutionary traditions; we understand their enthusiasm for building a strong country where the people are masters of their own affairs, regardless of the obstacles on the road ahead. We also understand your heroic assistance to other struggling peoples: your support for the Arab people resisting imperialist reconquest; your support for the Cuban people resisting imperialist attempts to obstruct the Cuban revolution through various threats; your support for the Congolese people suffering from brutal oppression. Therefore, please allow me to frankly say to you that the Cameroonian people now truly realize that today it is not just five million people there resisting French and British colonialism supported by American imperialism, but because we have 650 million children of the great Chinese people with us, we are already 655 million people engaged in the struggle; therefore, we feel very honored and unprecedentedly powerful. This is a force that French and British colonialists cannot ignore, and it is also a force that the United Nations cannot ignore in resolving the Cameroon issue. Please allow me to take this opportunity to say "thank you" to you in the name of the victimized people.

Striving for National Reunification and National Independence
Is the Goal of the Cameroonian People's Struggle

Our country is divided into two parts, ruled separately by French and British colonialists. Our country, since its history, was originally an independent kingdom. When Europeans first landed in Cameroon, they only engaged in some trade. But in the last century, when Europeans were engaged in colonial competition in Africa, our country became a German protectorate in 1884, with a protection period of 30 years, that is, until 1914. On July 12, 1914, the protection treaty expired, and we regained the right to independence, but the imperialists did not recognize this. They took advantage of the First World War to include our country among the so-called German territories, dividing it as their "spoils of war," without considering our protests. Even worse, although there was more than one German territory at the time, the imperialists divided our country and Togo into two parts, without considering the close historical, ethnic, economic, and other ties between these peoples. Therefore, due to this crime against our people, today you will see some nations with a long common history, culture, language, and customs divided into two parts. You will even see some plantations divided into two parts, one part in the French-controlled area and the other part in the British-controlled area, separated by an artificial boundary and some checkpoints. I don't need to explain to you that the Cameroonian people have never recognized, and will never recognize, this situation as legitimate. This is also why one of our basic goals is the reunification of our country.

During the Second World War, Cameroon contributed significant forces. Following Chad, Cameroon was the first to join General de Gaulle's Free French movement, and Cameroon was also the initial foundation of Marshal Leclerc's 2nd Armored Division. This division enjoyed a high reputation in the battles of Koufra in North Africa, the liberation of Paris, Reims-Strasbourg, and the attack on Germany. Perhaps I should mention that Mr. François Fotsso, Secretary-General of the Cameroon Democratic Youth Union, was once a member of this division. When we voluntarily contributed our lives, we were wholeheartedly defending the universal principles of freedom and national independence, not only defending these principles for others, but also so that we could finally enjoy them. In 1942, when Churchill and Roosevelt announced that all people who had lost their freedom would regain it, our people looked forward to a better tomorrow. But in 1944, when we liberated most of the French territory with our blood, de Gaulle closed all doors to the future, claiming that no autonomy system would ever be tried. In 1945, Cameroon did not regain its independence, but like a minor child, was placed under the international trusteeship system formulated by the United Nations.

Although the trusteeship system has its shortcomings, Article 76 states that its ultimate goal is to achieve independence based on the freely expressed wishes of the people of the international trust territory. We are now using this legal basis to formulate another goal of struggle—that is, the independence of Cameroon.

The Repression and Deception of French and British Colonial Authorities
Cannot Stop the Development of the Cameroonian National Movement

But we were deceived again, and we soon saw that France and Britain were firmly opposed to the unification and independence of Cameroon.

The Cameroonian People's Union, together with the Cameroon Democratic Women's Union and the General Confederation of Labor of Cameroon, formed the highly conscious, loyal, and active vanguard of the Cameroonian national movement. This is a progressive and anti-colonial nationalist movement. This organization was born in 1948, and since then, it has firmly advocated the unification and independence of our country, and in order to achieve these goals, it has put forward several interim programs. As long as the local people can participate in the management of public affairs, we are even willing to cooperate closely with the government authorities until complete independence. But they maintained contempt and silence, answering us with stubbornness and repression. In response to this situation, the progressive national movement issued the slogan of immediate unification and independence on April 22, 1955. Since then, the colonialists, especially the French colonialists, have encountered a huge opposition upsurge, which united men, women, old, young, workers, peasants, intellectuals, and the middle class. As a result, the colonialists adopted brutal measures. From May 25 to 31, 1955, more than 5,000 people were killed without any trial; tens of thousands of people were imprisoned and exiled. At the same time, in order to do all the bad things, the French government also announced the dissolution of the Cameroon People's Union, the Cameroon Democratic Women's Union, and the Cameroon Democratic Youth Organization. Police terror and rule were established throughout the country.

However, the colonialists did not realize that the Cameroonian people had matured. There is a saying in our country: "If the snake's head is not cut off, the snake will still bite." The colonialists failed to cut off the heads of the People's Union and other movements. The day after the so-called dissolution of the People's Union, the colonialists got nothing. All the leaders of the various movements had moved to the British-controlled area or gone underground, and the political struggle became more intense. By the end of 1956, the closed-door policy was detrimental to its initiators, and the Cameroon People's Union showed unprecedented strength.

At this time, the French colonialists formulated a conspiracy plan to directly annex Cameroon as French territory. They pieced together a parliament to be responsible for consultations on the issue of national status, hoping to attract some shameless people to participate in this parliament. Even in this case, the Cameroon People's Union seized this opportunity to express its willingness to participate in the elections, but an amnesty must be held so that all citizens in prisons, in exile, and underground could participate in the elections. However, the French government disdained to answer, they killed thousands of people, imprisoned thousands of people, and dissolved various movements that even the colonial authorities themselves admitted represented the wishes of 85% of the people. They established a police reign of terror, which alienated all nationalists. They also completely refused to hold an amnesty without prejudice. In this situation, they conducted the so-called parliamentary elections that decided the fate of the country. The Cameroon People's Union suggested, and could only suggest, that the people of the whole country refuse to participate in the elections. Some newspapers, although not very objective, also reported that 55% of the voters refused to vote. It was at this time that French imperialism was panicked by their repeated failures, and they launched a war against our people. Here I don't want to talk to you about what an irresponsible and unprincipled army does in a colonial war. You have experience in this area and have seen it in areas near your country. I just want to tell you that there are more than 60,000 French troops in Cameroon, not including the police and plainclothes police; our people are continuing to resist. Our people understand Chairman Mao Zedong's correct conclusion: "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." That is why, although France has armies, tanks, artillery, and other modern weapons, they cannot and will never be able to defeat us, even though our weapons are not comparable to theirs. Moreover, they also understand this very well, so they suddenly announced that they would stop opposing our demands for independence and announced that they were willing to give the Cameroonian people independence on January 1, 1960. They portrayed us as people who opposed the independence of Cameroon in front of our own people and public opinion. The day before yesterday, I heard the American representative of the United Nations Trusteeship Council say: In the world, inside and outside the United Nations, no force can prevent Cameroon from achieving independence on New Year's Day 1960. This made me feel very ridiculous. It is a good thing to achieve independence in 1960, and we have consistently advocated independence since 1955. But why are Mr. Sears or other representatives of colonial countries silent about the need to restore stability and establish true peace through genuine democratic measures? What reason is there to be silent about the five divisions of French troops who massacred our people? Why be silent about the fate of 50,000 people in concentration camps?

In fact, the colonialists understood nothing in Cameroon. They tried to deceive us with the name of independence, just like giving a child a piece of candy to coax them to sleep. But the Cameroonian people have long seen through these conspiracies and will fight resolutely to the end.

In 1957, the British authorities arrested and exiled thirteen leaders from different organizations who had taken refuge in the British zone after the 1955 incident, thinking that this time they had completely cut off the snake's head. On September 13 last year, the French colonialists announced that they had killed Ruben Um Nyobè, Secretary-General of the Cameroon People's Union, in a patrol, and they thought that the resistance movement had come to an end. On January 24, 1959, the British colonialists planned a secessionist conspiracy in southern Cameroon, and elections were conducted entirely under their supervision. They wanted to present the United Nations with an election result that favored Cameroon's merger with Nigeria, presenting the United Nations with a fait accompli. All these conspirators lifted a stone and dropped it on their own feet. Those who exiled us have given us the opportunity to go to Beijing, Moscow, Bucharest, Prague, New York, Cairo, Khartoum, Tunis, Rabat, Baghdad, and other places to expose the crimes they have committed in our country and to unite the support of the people of various countries for us. Those who announced the assassination of Ruben Um Nyobè on September 13, 1958, in a haughty and shameless manner, have had to admit today that since September 13, 1958, the resistance movement has greatly strengthened and given them a heavy blow. Those who wanted to create a fait accompli by merging British Southern Cameroons with Nigeria are faced with the victory of those who demand the unification of Cameroon. These advocates of unification won fourteen of the twenty-five seats and received more than 60% of the votes. All of this shows that the battle-tested and long-tested Cameroonian people know how to smash the conspiracies of imperialism and their servants and will never accept solutions that are contrary to their highest interests.

UN General Assembly Discusses the Future of Cameroon
Must Consider the Will of the Cameroonian People

The day after tomorrow, February 20, the United Nations General Assembly will resume its thirteenth session to discuss the future of Cameroon. The task of the General Assembly is complex, and it must do everything possible to complete this task for the benefit of the Cameroonian people, for the prestige of the United Nations organization, and for world peace. The General Assembly will listen to the report written by the delegation that visited Cameroon last November. This delegation is composed of the United States, New Zealand, India, and Haiti. This report is based on the imperialist point of view, that is, to give Cameroon superficial independence while retaining the current government of Cameroon, which they dare to consider representative. This report dares to assert that an unconditional and complete amnesty would be dangerous because it could cause tragedy throughout the country due to retaliatory actions. In addition, the report dares to believe that the results of the elections in Southern Cameroons under British rule are not convincing and cannot prove the people's will to unification. If the General Assembly follows such a view, it will be very dangerous, and not any kind of independence can solve the problem; at the same time, striving for stable and consolidated independence must be achieved in an atmosphere of peace, stability, and coordination. Our chairman, Félix-Roland Moumié, will point out at the United Nations podium this time that the only effective measures to restore this stable atmosphere are: (1) Unconditional and complete amnesty, pardoning all detainees, exiles, and all others persecuted for political beliefs, so that they can return to a normal life in Cameroon. (2) Restore all democratic freedoms, including restoring the legal status of the Cameroon People's Union, the Cameroon Democratic Women's Union, and the Democratic Youth, and withdraw all colonialist troops. (3) Conduct a simultaneous referendum on the issue of unification in the two regions of Cameroon under the supervision of the United Nations, and the result of the majority vote will be the only valid conclusion. (4) Under the supervision of the United Nations, conduct free elections in the two regions of Cameroon to establish a constitutional national assembly, which will produce a government that truly represents Cameroonian public opinion, and it will negotiate the future of the country with the trusteeship authorities.

These measures can ensure the restoration of a stable situation and thus ensure that the most representative opinions are affirmed through democratic means. If these opinions are not adopted and replaced by decisions that are imperialistic and colonialist in nature, it will be difficult to predict what will happen in the future.

The Cameroon People's Union has conducted a good struggle, and it has always expressed its willingness to reach an agreement. Our Secretary-General Nyobè pointed out in 1957: "Although it is difficult and impossible to oppose the Cameroon People's Union, it is certainly possible, and certainly very possible, to cooperate with it."

Ten years ago, Chairman Mao Zedong announced the birth of the People's Republic of China in Beijing after decades of struggle. The Cameroon People's Union is now issuing an appeal to the world in Beijing, especially to the United Nations, that it must make every effort to avoid the tragedy that imperialism inflicts on us against our will. We do not like war, and we are unwilling to sacrifice millions of lives for a problem that can be solved by a round table conference. Amnesty will not bring any tragedy; on the contrary, refusing amnesty will bring tragedy. Considerations to protect vested interests and refusing to consider the will of our people will bring tragedy. Tonight we are no longer five million people, we are 655 million, and the night after tomorrow, we will be one billion, maybe two billion. What reason does imperialism have to defeat us? What reason do they have to impose their will on us?

The United Nations General Assembly must resolve this issue, and in resolving this issue, it must consider three indispensable factors: the highest interests of Cameroon, the prestige of the United Nations itself, the peace of Cameroon, and the peace of the world.

Long live the independence and unification of Cameroon!
Long live the great unity of the people of Asia and Africa!
Long live world peace!
Long live the eternal and indestructible friendship between Cameroon and the great Chinese people!

专栏：

    喀麦隆人民是不可战胜的
    让·保罗·桑德在北京支持喀麦隆人民斗争大会上的讲话亲爱的朋友们：
    首先我代表正在为统一和民族独立而进行斗争的喀麦隆人民向你们致以兄弟般的敬礼。喀麦隆人民特别感到荣幸，因为中国亚非团结委员会和中国人民外交学会邀请他们唯一的和忠实的先锋——喀麦隆人民联盟来参加这次盛大的集会。当我们的人民得到伟大中国人民的支持，特别是像我在这里亲眼看到这样一次盛大的支援活动的时候，很难用语言来表达出正在斗争着的人民的感情，而我，作为他们在这里的代表更难以表达这种激动心情。我们了解伟大的中国人民，了解它的伟大历史和坚决的斗争，了解他们的革命传统；我们了解他们不顾前进道路上的障碍而建设一个强大的和人民当家作主的国家的这种热情。我们也了解你们对其他正在进行着斗争的人民的英勇援助：你们对反抗帝国主义重新征服的阿拉伯人民的支持；你们对反抗帝国主义企图用各种威胁手段来阻挠古巴革命的古巴人民的支持；你们对遭受残酷压迫的刚果人民的支持。所以，请允许我对你们坦率地说，喀麦隆人民现在真正体会到他们今天不只是五百万人民在那里反抗由美帝国主义支持的法英殖民主义，而是由于有六亿五千万伟大中国人民的儿女和我们在一起，我们已是六亿五千五百万人在进行斗争；因此，我们感到非常荣幸，也感到空前强大。这是一个法英殖民主义者所不能忽视的力量，是联合国在解决喀麦隆问题当中也不能忽视的力量。请允许我借此机会以受害的人民的名义向你们说“谢谢”。
    争取祖国统一和民族独立
    是喀麦隆人民的斗争目标
    我们国家被分成两部分，分别被法英殖民主义者统治。我国自有史以来，原来是一个独立王国。当欧洲人起初在喀麦隆登陆的时候，他们只是作一些贸易。但是在上一世纪，当欧洲人在非洲进行殖民竞争的时候，我国在1884年变成德国的保护国，保护期是三十年，也就是说直到1914年。1914年7月12日保护条约满期了，我们重新获得独立的权利，但是帝国主义者不承认这一点，他们利用第一次世界大战把我们国家又列入那些所谓德国属地，作为他们的“战利品”来分割，而对我们的抗议不予任何考虑。更坏的是，虽然当时不只有一个德国属地，帝国主义者却把我国和多哥都分成了两部分，毫不考虑这些人民之间历史上的、种族上的、经济上的和其他的密切关系。因此，由于这种反对我们人民的罪行，在今天你们会看到一些有着长久共同历史、文化、语言和风俗习惯的民族被分割为两部分。你们甚至会看到一些种植园也分成两部分，一部分在法统治区，而另一部分在英统治区，用一个人为的疆界和一些关卡把它分开。我无需向你们说明，喀麦隆人民从来没有承认，而且永远也不会承认这种情况是合法的。这也是为什么我们的基本目标之一就是我国的重新统一。
    在第二次世界大战期间，喀麦隆曾贡献了重大的力量。继乍得之后，喀麦隆第一个参加了戴高乐将军领导的自由法兰西运动，喀麦隆也是勒克莱尔克元帅统率的第二装甲师的最初基础。这个师在北非公夫拉，在解放巴黎，兰斯·斯特拉斯堡和进攻德国的战斗中享有很高的声望。也许我应当举出喀麦隆民主青年联盟总书记弗朗索阿·伏索先生就曾经是这个师的一个成员。当我们自愿地贡献出生命的时候，我们是全心全意为了保卫自由和民族独立的普遍原则的，不仅是为别人保卫这种原则，而且是为了最后我们也能享有这种原则。1942年丘吉尔和罗斯福宣布所有失去自由的人民都将重新得到自由，当时我们的人民期待获得美好的明天。但是在1944年当我们用鲜血解放了法兰西的大部分土地的时候，戴高乐就已经关上了所有通向未来的大门，竟擅称绝不试行任何自治制度。1945年，喀麦隆没有恢复独立，反而像一个没有成年的儿童一样，被置于联合国制定的国际托管制度之下。
    托管制度尽管有其缺点，但在它的第七十六条中提出它最终目的是根据国际托管地区的人民自由表达的愿望达成独立。我们现在就是利用这个法律根据，制定了另外一个斗争目标——这就是喀麦隆的独立。
    法英殖民当局的镇压欺骗手段
    挡不住喀麦隆民族运动的发展
    但是我们是再一次受迷惑了，我们很快地看到，法国和英国是坚决反对喀麦隆的统一和独立的。
    喀麦隆人民联盟和喀麦隆民主妇女联盟、喀麦隆劳工总联合会一起组成了喀麦隆民族运动的具有高度觉悟的、忠实的和活跃的先锋。这是一个进步的和反殖民主义的民族主义运动。这个组织诞生于1948年，从那时起，它一直坚决主张我国的统一和独立，并且为了达到这些目标，提出了若干临时纲领。只要当地人民能够参加公共事务的管理，我们甚至愿意和政府当局密切合作，一直到完全独立。但是他们保持了蔑视和沉默，用顽固态度和镇压手段来回答我们。针对这种情况，进步的民族运动在1955年4月22日发出立即统一和独立的口号。从那时起，殖民主义者，特别是法国殖民主义者，就遇到巨大的反对高潮，而这个巨大的高潮团结了男、女、老、少、工人、农民、知识分子和中产阶级。于是，殖民主义者采取了惨暴的手段，从1955年5月25日到31日，不经任何审判，五千以上的人被杀害；成千上万人被禁闭和流放，同时为了把坏事作尽，法国政府还宣布解散喀麦隆人民联盟、喀麦隆民主妇女联盟、喀麦隆民主青年组织，警察恐怖与统治在全国范围内建立了起来。
    然而殖民主义者没有认识到喀麦隆人民已经成熟了。在我们国家有一句俗语：“假如蛇头没有斩掉，蛇还会咬人。”殖民主义者没能把人民联盟和其他各个运动的头斩掉。在对人民联盟的所谓解散的第二天，殖民主义者什么也没有得到。所有各个运动的领导者都已转移到英国管辖区或转入地下，政治斗争进行得更加激烈。1956年底，封闭政策对他的发起人本身不利了，喀麦隆人民联盟则显示出空前强大的力量。
    在这个时候，法殖民主义者制定了一个把喀麦隆直截了当吞并为法国领土的阴谋计划。他们拼凑一个议会，来负责进行关于国家地位问题的协商，他们希望能吸引一些无耻之徒参加这个议会。即使在这种情况下，喀麦隆人民联盟还是抓住这一机会表示愿意参加选举，但必须举行大赦，以便一切在牢狱中、在流放中和转入地下的公民们都能够参加选举。然而法国政府却不屑于回答，他们杀了几千人、监禁了几千人、解散了殖民当局本身也承认的代表85％人民愿望的各个运动。他们建立了一个恐怖的警察统治，结果是疏远了所有民族主义分子。他们也完全拒绝不咎既往而举行大赦。在这样情况下，他们进行了决定国家命运的所谓议会选举。喀麦隆人民联盟建议，也只能建议，全国人民拒绝参加选举。一些报纸尽管并不太客观，也报道55％的选民拒绝投票。就是在这个时候，法帝国主义因为他们屡次失败而感到恐慌，他们发动了反对我们人民的战争。这里我不想向诸位谈一个无责任感和无原则的军队在殖民战争中的所作所为。你们在这方面有经验，并且在你们国土附近地区也见到过这种情况。我只想告诉大家：在喀麦隆有六万多法国军队，其中警察和便衣队还不在内；我们的人民在继续进行反抗。我们的人民了解毛泽东主席的正确论断：“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”。这也就是为什么虽然法国拥有军队、坦克、大炮和其他现代化武器，他们不能、而且永远也不能把我们打垮，尽管我们的武器不能与他们相比。此外，他们也很明白这一点，所以他们突然宣布停止反对我们争取独立的要求，宣布愿在1960年1月1日给喀麦隆人民的独立。他们在我们自己人民和舆论面前，把我们说成是反对喀麦隆独立的人。前天，我听到联合国托管理事会美国代表说：在世界上，在联合国之内和之外，没有任何力量能够阻止喀麦隆在1960年元旦达成独立。这使我感到非常滑稽。在1960年达成独立是好事，我们从1955年起就一贯主张独立。但为什么西尔斯先生或其他殖民国家的代表对需要通过真正的民主措施以恢复安定和建立真正和平都一言不发呢？有什么理由对屠杀我国人民的五师法国军队一言不发呢？为什么对在集中营里五万人的命运一言不发呢。
    事实上殖民主义者在喀麦隆什么也没有懂，他们企图用独立这个名词来欺骗我们，就像给小孩一块糖，来哄他们睡觉一样。但是喀麦隆人民早已看穿这些阴谋并将坚决斗争到底。
    1957年英国当局逮捕和流放了在1955年事变之后在英属区避难的十三个属于不同组织的领导人，他们以为这一次把蛇的头完全砍掉了。去年9月13日法国殖民主义者宣布他们在一次巡逻中，杀害了喀麦隆人民联盟总书记鲁本·尼奥勃，他们当时以为抵抗运动就此结束了。1959年1月24日，英国殖民主义者在喀麦隆南部计划了一次分裂阴谋，完全在他们监督之下进行了选举。他们想在联合国拿出一个赞同喀麦隆合并于尼日利亚的选举结果，使联合国面对既成事实。所有这些阴谋制造者搬起石头打了自己的脚。流放我们的那些人使我们能有机会到北京、到莫斯科、到布加勒斯特、到布拉格、到纽约、到开罗、到喀土穆、到突尼斯、到拉巴特、到巴格达以及其他地方，来揭发他们在我国所犯的罪行，并把各国人民对我们的支持联合在一起。那些曾经在1958年9月13日趾高气扬、不知羞耻的宣布暗杀了鲁本·尼奥勃的人们，今天不得不承认，自从1958年9月13日以来，抵抗运动是大大地加强了，并且给予他们沉重打击。那些想把英属喀麦隆南部和尼日利亚合并造成既成事实的人们，却面临了要求统一喀麦隆的人的胜利。这些主张统一的人在二十五个席位里得到了十四个席位，并且得到了60％以上的选票。所有这一切说明，久经战斗和久经考验的喀麦隆人民知道如何粉碎帝国主义和他们的仆从们的阴谋，并且将绝不接受和他们最高利益相违背的解决方案。
    联合国大会讨论喀麦隆前途
    必须考虑喀麦隆人民的意志
    后天，2月20日，联合国大会将恢复它的十三届大会，讨论喀麦隆的前途。大会的任务是复杂的，它必须为了喀麦隆人民的利益，为了联合国组织的威信和世界和平尽一切力量完成这一任务。大会将要听取去年11月到喀麦隆访问的代表团所写的报告。这个代表团由美国、新西兰、印度和海地组成。这个报告是从帝国主义的观点出发的，即给予喀麦隆表面上的独立，同时还保留他们居然敢认为是具有代表性的喀麦隆现政府。这个报告居然敢肯定地说，一次无条件的完全大赦将是危险的，因为这可能由于报复行动而在全国产生悲剧。此外，报告居然还敢认为在英国统治之下的南喀麦隆进行选举的结果并不具有说服力，也不能证明人民要求统一的意志。如果大会遵循这样一种观点，将是非常危险的，并不是任何一种独立都能解决问题；同时，争取稳定和巩固的独立，必须在和平安定和协调的气氛中才能获得。我们的主席费利克斯·罗兰·穆米这次在联合国的讲坛上将指出，恢复这种稳定气氛唯一有效措施就是：（1）无条件地完全大赦，赦免所有被拘禁的人、流放者和所有其他由于政治信仰而受到迫害的人，使他们能够在喀麦隆重新得到正常生活。（2）恢复一切民主自由，包括恢复喀麦隆人民联盟、喀麦隆民主妇女联盟和民主青年的合法地位和撤退一切殖民主义者的军队。（3）在喀麦隆两个地区由联合国监督，就统一问题同时进行公民投票，大多数票的结果将是唯一的有效结论。（4）在喀麦隆两个地区，由联合国监督，进行自由选举以成立一个制宪国民议会，这个议会将产生一个真正代表喀麦隆舆论的政府，由它和托管当局商谈国家的前途。
    这些措施能够保证恢复安定局面，并从而保证通过民主方式肯定大多数的有代表性的意见。如果不采纳这些意见，而以具有帝国主义和殖民主义本质的决定来代替它们，那将很难预测将来会发生什么情况。
    喀麦隆人民联盟进行了很好的斗争，它一贯表示愿意达成协议，我们总书记尼奥勃在1957年曾指出：“虽然反对喀麦隆人民联盟是很困难的，也是不可能的，但是和它合作却肯定是可能，肯定是很可能的。”
    十年前毛泽东主席在从事斗争数十年之后，在北京宣布了中华人民共和国的诞生。喀麦隆人民联盟现在在北京向全世界发出呼吁，特别是向联合国发出呼吁，必须尽一切努力来避免帝国主义不顾我们的意志使我们遭受的悲剧。我们并不喜欢战争，我们不愿意为了一个可以用圆桌会议来解决的问题而牺牲千万人的生命。大赦不会带来任何悲剧，相反的，拒绝大赦才会带来悲剧。保护既得利益的考虑和拒绝考虑我国人民的意志才会带来悲剧。今天晚上我们不再是五百万人了，我们是六亿五千五百万，后天晚上，我们将是十亿，可能是二十亿，帝国主义有什么理由能够战胜我们呢？他们有什么理由能够把他们的意志强加于我们呢？
    联合国大会必须解决这个问题，在解决这个问题的时候，它必须考虑三个不可缺少的因素：喀麦隆的最高利益。联合国本身的威信，喀麦隆的和平以及全世界的和平。
    喀麦隆的独立和统一万岁！
    亚非各国人民大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    喀麦隆和伟大中国人民之间的永恒的、不可摧毁的友谊万岁！
