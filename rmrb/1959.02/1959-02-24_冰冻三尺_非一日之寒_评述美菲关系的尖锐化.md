It Takes More Than One Cold Day to Freeze Three Feet of Water
—Commentary on the Intensification of US-Philippine Relations
Luo Erzhuang

The contradictions between the United States and the Philippines, the country it controls most tightly and for the longest time, have recently become more acute. Since the end of last year, among the Philippine people and ruling groups, there has been a more intense outcry than at any time in the past against the extreme inequality in US-Philippine relations over a long period. The Philippine people's desire to achieve genuine independence and break free from American control is at an all-time high. Even dispatches from Manila by the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse on January 20 pointed out that the fundamental problem in current US-Philippine relations lies in the Philippines, which has always been subject to American control and enslavement, "demanding to achieve respected independence free from moral, political, and economic pressure," demanding to wash away the "shame of being considered merely a rubber-stamp satellite state of the United States" and become a "free-thinking Asian country."

The United States hurriedly recalled its ambassador to the Philippines, Bohlen, to discuss countermeasures. The Philippines immediately recalled its ambassador to the United States, Romulo, to Manila. The Philippine Congress is reviewing Philippine-American relations amid a storm of criticism of American policy. Prominent Philippine political figures are constantly suggesting measures that are in line with national interests. The wind is howling, and the momentum is very strong. Dulles once tried to gloss over the strained US-Philippine relations, saying that this was merely "superficial friction in certain areas." But Dulles' words were met with a head-on rebuke from Philippine figures.

As the saying goes, it takes more than one cold day to freeze three feet of water. The fundamental reason for the current tension in US-Philippine relations is the result of the United States' long-term control, plunder, enslavement, and humiliation of the Philippines.

The Tragic Situation of the "Democratic Showcase"

As everyone knows, the United States has always proclaimed that the Philippines' "independence" is its "gift," touting US-Philippine relations as a "shining example" of "equal and independent national relations," and calling the Philippines a "democratic showcase" arranged by the United States in Asia. What real content do all the nice words used by the Americans have?

The United States invaded the Philippines in 1898 and directly carried out forty-eight years of colonial rule. After World War II, the national liberation movement flourished. In order to put a hypocritical veil over its colonialist face, the United States nominally declared the Philippines independent in July 1946. But in reality, it imposed new colonial shackles on the Philippines through a series of unequal treaties it forced the Philippines to sign.

The "Equal Rights Amendment" that the United States forced the Philippines to add to its constitution and the US-Philippine "Trade Agreement" that it forced the Philippines to sign allowed Americans to continue to plunder the Philippines' resources and control the Philippines' important economic lifelines in a blatant manner. Americans enjoy the same rights as Filipinos to exploit natural resources and operate public utilities in the Philippines. They not only maintain the many factories, mines, forests, and plantations they already occupy, continue to operate various monopolistic public utilities, but also continuously expand the scope of their plunder of Philippine resources in the past twelve years. Under the guise of "free trade," the United States dumps goods into the Philippines without restriction, but stipulates quotas for Philippine exports to the United States and implements price cuts and discrimination against Philippine goods, which makes it impossible for Philippine imports and exports to achieve balance, resulting in an annual deficit of approximately US$200 million in international payments. In addition, as a result of the United States' shifting of the economic crisis, the Philippine financial economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the government budget deficit and public debt have soared from US$12 million in 1953 to US$109.5 million in 1958. Moreover, the only remaining reserves of less than US$130 million have been designated to repay debts to American banks and as other expenses. At the same time, due to the fact that many factories that rely on imported raw materials for production have been forced to shut down one after another, the number of unemployed people in the Philippines has now increased to 2.5 million, equivalent to 30% of the total national labor force. Prices are rising, people's livelihoods are declining, and cries of despair are everywhere.

In addition to economic plunder, the extent to which Philippine sovereignty has been violated is also astonishing. The implementation of the "US-Philippine Military Base Agreement" signed in 1947 is, in effect, tantamount to the American military occupation of the Philippines. The dozens of land, sea, and air force bases occupied by the United States in the Philippines have become "states within a state" where the US military can do whatever it wants. The US military enjoys extraterritorial rights and various privileges, can wantonly interfere in local Philippine affairs, promulgate its own laws, levy exorbitant taxes, prohibit Filipinos from mining on their own land, expel Filipinos from the country at will, and use these bases to carry out large-scale smuggling activities that harm the Philippines, kill and steal, and commit all kinds of evil. What is particularly dangerous is that the United States is using these bases behind the back of the Philippines to carry out nuclear war preparations and other military conspiracies, which is pushing the Philippines to the brink of a devastating war, which has caused great shock among people from all walks of life in the Philippines.

As for the so-called "US-Philippine Military Assistance Agreement" and the "US-Philippine Mutual Defense Treaty," in addition to subjecting the Philippine army to American control, they are nothing more than an irony of the "equal relations" between the United States and the Philippines. The Philippines has to painstakingly pay 1.1 million pesos each year to support American military advisers for this purpose, but it not only has no say in the formulation of plans related to this, but even the request to exchange military intelligence in the Philippines is rejected by the United States.

Because the United States has carried out strict control over the Philippines in all aspects, it has been able to drag the Philippines into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and place the Philippines in a position of subservience to the United States' war policy in the United Nations and various diplomatic occasions. This situation has placed the Philippines in an extremely isolated position in Asia. Last year, when it ran for a seat on the United Nations Economic and Social Council, it failed because it did not receive the support of an Asian country. Philippine figures and public opinion were extremely shocked by this, and they called for an immediate change in the policy of following the United States and a restoration of the Philippines' international status.

Nationalism is surging

For twelve years, the Philippine people have watched as they continue to suffer the most barbaric plunder and trampling in terms of economy, politics, sovereignty, dignity, etc., and in the painful experience, they have profoundly realized the actual meaning of the "independence" "bestowed" by the United States. Former Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives Jose Laurel Jr. pointed out long ago that the Philippines is under the "new oppression of the iron heel" of the United States, "a more subtle and therefore more despicable." In recent years, Filipinos have continuously called for the revision or abolition of the various unequal treaties signed with the United States. But the United States, which has always regarded itself as the supreme emperor, has always adopted an extremely contemptuous and deaf attitude towards these just demands of the Philippine people.

The negotiations on revising the military base agreement, which began as early as 1956, have not been resolved to this day because the United States has stubbornly refused to relinquish its judicial jurisdiction over American soldiers who commit crimes. The misconduct of the US military is still the same; the murderers who indiscriminately kill Filipinos are still able to escape justice or leave triumphantly under the protection of this agreement. As for the issue of revising the US-Philippine "Trade Agreement," under the strong pressure of all walks of life in the Philippines, although the United States has made some superficial concessions, it has actually not harmed the privileges it has obtained in the Philippines at all. The huge losses and harms suffered by the Philippines economically have increased year after year. Because the United States is fundamentally unwilling to let the Philippines develop industry and become a competitor to American goods, it has not only been slow to allocate most of the loans it has promised to the Philippines under the name of "economic assistance," but has not even paid a very small portion of the compensation for war losses and other expenses of US$972 million that the Philippines requested the United States to repay as early as 1955. The arrogant and despotic attitude adopted by the United States towards the Philippines for a long time and the tragic situation in which the Philippines finds itself have made the Filipinos feel that they can no longer tolerate it. They deeply realize that trying to make the United States change its wolfish ambitions through begging is tantamount to trying to catch the moon in the water. Therefore, the struggle to demand and strive to break free from American control and take the road of national independence is rising day by day.

The Philippines has indicated that it will insist on maintaining its sovereignty over the American military bases in the Philippines. Congressional figures have successively called for shortening the lease term of American military bases and stipulating the use of these bases, and for abolishing the American joint military advisory group. The Baguio City Council even passed a resolution demanding the cancellation of the American military base there.

In the economic field, the Philippine National Economic Council and the Provisional Speaker of the House of Representatives, Castañeda, successively proposed the policies of "Filipinos First" and "Philippine Products First" aimed at countering American economic plunder. The president of the Industrial Association called on the Philippine authorities to summon the courage to resist American interference in Philippine economic policy. Congressional leaders and financial experts even argued that if the US-Philippine Trade Agreement cannot be revised soon and the special import tax on American goods is restored to the 17% level, then this agreement should be abolished. There have been calls inside and outside the parliament to break away from dependence on the American market in order to develop new trade relations with countries in Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia.

At the same time, the Philippine Congress, government agencies, and public opinion were also filled with a surge of indignation against being a tail of American foreign policy. Senate Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Sumulong, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Mitra, and Senator Recto have made strong accusations against the government in this regard, demanding a complete change in the policy of following the United States in order to eliminate the stigma of being a vassal state and restore the Philippines' "status in the Asian family." The nationalist sentiment and peaceful neutral tendencies surging in all strata of Philippine society are constantly growing.

Threats and Inducements Deepen Contradictions

Faced with this strong wave of domestic people striving for independence and freedom, as well as the Philippines' political humiliation and economic bankruptcy, the Philippine ruling group, except for the extreme pro-American faction, has begun to feel the dangerous consequences of continuing to blindly follow the United States. Therefore, while mentioning continuing to be America's "most steadfast friend and ally," it also stated that it would formulate some policies that are beneficial to national interests. Philippine President Garcia made a statement in December last year, advocating that "no longer completely rely on the protective power of the United States" and "prepare to broaden our horizons and explore a wider range of friendship and cooperation." He said, "If this is a policy shift, ... it should be seen as a shift towards a higher stage of national maturity and national self-confidence." At present, the Philippine government's demands for revising the US-Philippine military base agreement, the trade agreement, and the more than 900 million US dollar compensation fee reflect the Philippines' legitimate national aspirations to a certain extent.

However, the American imperialism, which has always regarded the Philippines as a "matter of course" "subordinate" and object of plunder, blatantly continues to put on a ferocious face of a suzerain state, holding gold coins in one hand and a big stick in the other, using all kinds of threats and inducements to try to suppress the Philippine nationalist wave. In October last year, the United States conspired to instigate a coup to overthrow the Garcia government, attempting to establish a completely docile proxy regime. After this conspiracy failed, the United States continued to direct the Liberal Party Vice President Macapagal to attack Garcia for pursuing a "chaotic policy" towards the United States. At the same time, the United States launched an attack propaganda against the Philippines. The American "Time" magazine openly insulted Philippine President Garcia and other officials as so-called "fat cats" who damaged the "democratic showcase" arranged by the United States. In early February, while announcing a loan of more than 11 million US dollars to the Philippines to build roads to temporarily quell the anti-American wave in the Philippines, the United States publicly rejected the Philippines' request for the United States to pay a compensation fee of more than 900 million US dollars. All of this further exposes the American imperialism's aggressive attempt to insist on controlling and enslaving the Philippines. This is like adding fuel to the fire, arousing greater indignation in the Philippines. Philippine congressional figures strongly condemned the United States for the slander it has wantonly inflicted on the Philippines. A mass demonstration protesting against American slander took place in front of the American Embassy in the Philippines. The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee of the Philippines, Mitra, strongly advocated launching a movement to force world opinion to force the United States to pay the full compensation, and if necessary, take the final means to submit the issue to the World Court for adjudication.

Among the Philippine ruling group, dissatisfaction with the American overbearing attitude has been further reflected. After the Philippine authorities refused to allow American "Time" magazine reporter Bell, who insulted Garcia, to enter the country, they have decided to insist on demanding that the United States pay all the outstanding payments. Garcia also stated that he would soon resume adding a 25% fee when selling foreign exchange. On the issue of revising the military base agreement, the Philippine authorities have also stated that they will maintain a firm attitude, in addition to particularly emphasizing that they want greater judicial jurisdiction over American soldiers who commit crimes in the Philippines, and also require the United States to guarantee that the United States cannot unilaterally use its military bases in the Philippines to conduct wars in the Far East without the consent of the Philippines. The contradictions between the United States and the Philippines are continuing to deepen.

Because the American imperialism's control over the Philippines is extremely deep and broad, the long-term policy of following and depending on the United States pursued by the Philippine government has caused serious consequences, and the Philippine people's struggle for independence and freedom is very arduous. However, the wave of Philippine nationalism is increasingly powerfully impacting the American imperialism's colonial rule, and no matter what, the final victory will definitely belong to the Philippine people.

    冰冻三尺　非一日之寒
    ——评述美菲关系的尖锐化
    罗尔庄
    美国和它控制最紧最久的菲律宾之间的矛盾，近来趋于尖锐化。从去年年底以来，在菲律宾人民和统治集团中，对于长时期来美菲关系中的极端不平等现象，比过去任何时期都更加剧烈地响起了激愤的声浪。菲律宾人民要求获得真正独立、摆脱美国控制的情绪空前高涨。甚至美联社和法新社1月20日在马尼拉发出的电讯也指出，目前美菲关系的根本问题，在于一向遭受美国控制和奴役的菲律宾“要求实现不受道义、政治和经济压力的受尊敬的独立”，要求洗去“被认为只是美国一个橡皮图章卫星国”的“耻辱”和成为一个“可以自由思想的亚洲国家”。
    美国慌慌张张召回驻菲律宾大使波伦，商讨对策。菲律宾也立即把它的驻美大使罗慕洛召回马尼拉。菲律宾国会在一片激烈批评美国政策声中审查菲美关系。菲律宾的著名政界人士不断建议采取符合于民族利益的措施。风声呼呼，其势甚烈。杜勒斯曾企图掩饰美菲紧张关系，说这仅仅是“在某些方面的表面摩擦”。但杜勒斯的话，遭到了菲律宾人士的迎头痛斥。
    俗语说，冰冻三尺，非一日之寒。目前美菲关系紧张的根本原因，是美国长期以来对菲律宾进行控制、掠夺、奴役和侮辱而造成的结果。
    “民主橱窗”境况悲惨
    大家知道，美国一直宣扬菲律宾的“独立”是它的“恩赐”，吹嘘美菲关系是“平等独立的国家关系”的“光辉范例”，并把菲律宾称为美国在亚洲布置的“民主橱窗”。美国人所使用的一切好听字眼，到底有些什么真实内容呢？
    美国在1898年侵入菲律宾，对菲律宾直接进行了四十八年的殖民统治。第二次世界大战后，民族解放运动蓬勃展开。美国为了给自己的殖民主义嘴脸蒙上一层虚伪的面纱，于1946年7月在名义上宣布给予菲律宾独立。但实际上它通过迫使菲律宾签订的一系列不平等协定，仍然给菲律宾套上新的殖民主义的镣铐。
    美国迫使菲律宾在宪法中附加的“平等权利法案”和迫使菲律宾签订的美菲“贸易协定”，使美国人得以明目张胆地继续掠夺菲律宾的资源，控制菲律宾的重要经济命脉。美国人在菲律宾享有与菲律宾人同等的开采自然资源和开办公用事业的权利。他们不仅保持已经占有的许多工厂、矿山、森林和种植园，继续经营各种垄断性的公用事业，并且十二年来不断扩大他们对菲律宾资源掠夺的范围。在“自由贸易”的幌子下，美国无限制地向菲律宾倾销商品，但规定了菲律宾向美国输出货物的限额，对菲律宾货物实行压价和歧视，这就使菲律宾的进出口远远不能获得平衡，因而在国际支付中每年出现大约二亿美元的逆差。加以美国转嫁经济危机的结果，菲律宾财政经济濒于破产，政府预算赤字和公债已从1953年的一千二百万美元激增至1958年的一亿零九百五十万美元。而且目前仅有的不足一亿三千万美元的储备也已被指定用来偿还美国银行的债务和作为其他方面的开支。同时，由于许多依靠进口原料进行生产的工厂被迫纷纷停工，目前菲律宾的失业人数已增加至二百五十万人，相当于全国劳动力总数的30％。物价上涨，民生雕蔽，哀鸿遍地。
    除经济遭受掠夺外，菲律宾主权遭受侵犯的程度也是惊人的。1947年签订的“美菲军事基地协定”的实施，实际上形同美国对菲律宾的军事占领。美国在菲律宾占有的数十个陆海空军基地，已经成为美军为非作歹的“国中之国”。美军享有治外法权和各种特权，可以肆无忌惮地干涉菲律宾的地方事务，自行颁布法令，勒取苛捐杂税，不许菲律宾人在自己的土地上开矿，随便把菲律宾人驱逐出境，并利用这些基地大量进行危害菲律宾的走私活动，杀人越货，无恶不作。特别危险的是美国背着菲律宾利用这些基地进行核战争的准备工作和其他军事阴谋活动，更是把菲律宾推向毁灭性的战争边沿，这在菲律宾各界人士中引起了巨大的震惊。
    至于所谓“美菲军事援助协定”和“美菲联防条约”，实际上除了使菲律宾的军队遭受美国控制外，也只不外是对美菲“平等关系”的讽刺。菲律宾为此每年要吃力地付出一百一十万比索来供养美国军事顾问，但在制订与此有关的计划时不仅无发言权，甚至连交换在菲律宾的军事情报的要求，也遭到美国拒绝。
    由于美国在各方面对菲律宾进行了严密的控制，就使它得以把菲律宾拉进东南亚侵略集团，并在联合国和各种外交场合使菲律宾处于美国战争政策追随者的仆从地位。这种情况使菲律宾在亚洲陷于极其孤立的地步。去年它在竞选联合国经济及社会理事会的席位时，由于没有获得一个亚洲国家的支持而落选。菲律宾人士和舆论界对此极为震动，纷纷发出要求立即改变追随美国政策、恢复菲律宾的国际地位的呼声。
    民族主义浪潮澎湃
    十二年来，菲律宾人民眼看着自己在经济、政治、主权、尊严等等方面仍然遭受着最野蛮的掠夺和践踏，在痛苦的经历中深刻地认识到美国所“赐予”的“独立”的实际意义。前菲律宾众议院议长小何塞·劳雷尔早就指出菲律宾是处在美国“一种更加巧妙因而也就更加卑鄙的新的压迫的铁蹄”之下。连年来，菲律宾人不断发出要求修改或废除与美国签订的种种不平等协定的呼声。但一向以太上皇自居的美国，对菲律宾人民这些正义要求始终采取极其轻蔑和充耳不闻的态度。
    早在1956年就开始的修改军事基地协定的谈判，由于美国始终顽固地拒绝放弃对犯罪的美国军人的司法裁判权，至今未能解决。美军之为非作歹，依然如故；滥杀菲律宾人的凶手，仍然得以在这个协定的庇护下逍遥法外或扬长归去。至于修改美菲“贸易协定”的问题，在菲律宾各界强大压力下，美国虽然表面上作出一点让步，但实际上丝毫无损它在菲律宾所获得的特权。菲律宾在经济上蒙受的巨大损失和危害，年年有加无已。由于美国根本不愿让菲律宾发展工业，成为美国货物的竞争者，因而不仅对在“经济援助”美名下已经许诺给菲律宾的大部分贷款迟迟不肯拨付，甚至连菲律宾在1955年就向美国提出要求偿还的战时损失等赔偿费九亿七千二百万美元，至今也只偿付了很小的一部分。美国长期以来对菲律宾所采取的骄横跋扈的态度和菲律宾所处的悲惨景况，已经使菲律宾人感到忍无可忍，他们深深认识，要想通过哀求来使美国改变狼子野心，那无异于水中捞月。因此要求和争取摆脱美国控制、走民族独立道路的斗争，日益高涨起来。
    菲律宾已经表示要坚持保持它对美国在菲律宾的军事基地的主权。国会人士纷纷要求缩短美国军事基地租借期和规定这些基地的用途，撤销美国联合军事顾问团。碧瑶市议会更通过决议，要求取消美国在那里的军事基地。
    在经济方面，菲律宾全国经济委员会与众议院临时议长卡斯塔尼达先后提出了旨在对抗美国经济掠夺的“菲律宾人第一”和“菲律宾产品第一”的政策。工业协会会长要求菲律宾当局鼓起勇气来抵制美国对菲律宾经济政策的干涉。国会领袖和财政专家更主张，如果不能早日修改美菲贸易协定，把美国商品的特别进口税恢复到17％的水平，就废除这个协定。议会内外纷纷要求摆脱对美国市场的依赖，以便同欧洲、非洲和东南亚等地区国家发展新的贸易关系。
    与此同时，菲律宾国会、政府机构和舆论界也充满了一片反对做美国外交政策尾巴的激愤情绪。参议院外交委员会主席苏木朗、众议院外交委员会主席米特拉和参议员雷克托等在这方面对政府提出了强烈的指责，要求完全改变追随美国的政策，以消除仆从国家的污名，恢复菲律宾“在亚洲大家庭中的地位”。菲律宾各阶层人士中激荡着的民族主义情绪和和平中立倾向不断在增长中。
    威迫利诱　矛盾加深
    面对着国内人民这种强烈的争取独立自由的浪潮，以及菲律宾在政治上饱受侮辱和经济上濒临破产的绝境，菲律宾统治集团内部除了极端亲美派以外，已经开始感到继续一味追随美国的危险后果，因而在提到继续做美国的“最坚定的朋友和盟国”的同时，也表示将要制订一些有利于民族利益的政策。菲律宾总统加西亚曾在去年12月间发表谈话，主张“不再完全依赖美国的保护力量”，“准备扩大眼界，探求更多的友好和合作的范围。”他说，“如果说这是一种政策的转变的话，……应该把它看作是朝着民族成熟和民族自信这个更高阶段的转变”。目前，菲律宾政府关于修改美菲军事基地协定、贸易协定和九亿多美元赔偿费的要求，都在一定程度上反映了菲律宾的正当的民族愿望。
    但是，一向把菲律宾看成是“理所当然”的“属下”和掠夺对象的美帝国主义，却悍然地继续摆出一副宗主国的狰狞面孔，一手拿着金元，一手持着大棒，使出了种种威迫利诱手段，企图把菲律宾的民族主义浪潮镇压下去。去年10月，美国曾阴谋策动推翻加西亚政府的政变，企图建立一个完全驯顺的代理人政权。这一阴谋失败后，美国继续指使自由党人副总统马卡帕格攻击加西亚对美国奉行“混乱政策”。同时，美国发动了对菲律宾的攻击宣传。美国“时代”杂志公然辱骂菲律宾总统加西亚和其他官员是所谓损害美国布置的“民主橱窗”的“胖猫”。2月初，美国在宣布贷给菲律宾一千一百多万美元修筑公路，来暂时平息菲律宾的反美浪潮的同时，却公开拒绝菲律宾提出的要美国支付九亿多美元赔偿费的要求。所有这些，都进一步暴露了美帝国主义坚持控制和奴役菲律宾的侵略企图。这就如同火上加油，在菲律宾激起了更大的愤慨。菲律宾国会人士强烈地谴责美国对菲律宾所滥施的诋毁。在美国驻菲律宾大使馆前发生了抗议美国诽谤的群众示威。菲律宾众议院外交委员会主席米特拉更强烈地主张发起一个运动使世界舆论强迫美国支付全部赔偿费，并且在必要时采取最后手段把这个问题提交世界法庭裁决。
    在菲律宾统治集团中，对美国横行霸道的不满情绪，也有了进一步的反映。菲律宾当局在拒绝辱骂加西亚的美国“时代”杂志记者贝耳入境后，已经决定将坚持要求美国偿付全部欠款。加西亚还表示不久将恢复在出售外汇时附加25％的费用。在修改军事基地协定问题上，菲律宾当局也已表示将保持坚定的态度，除特别强调要对在菲律宾犯罪的美国军人有较大的司法裁判权外，并要求美国保证：在没有得到菲律宾同意的情况下，美国不能片面地使用它在菲律宾的军事基地来在远东地区进行战争。美菲之间的矛盾，正在继续加深。
    由于美帝国主义对菲律宾的控制极其深广，菲律宾政府长期执行的追随和依附美国的政策造成了严重的后果，菲律宾人民争取独立自由的斗争是十分艰巨的。但是，菲律宾民族主义的浪潮正在日益有力地冲击着美帝国主义的殖民统治，无论如何最后的胜利将一定属于菲律宾人民。（附图片）
