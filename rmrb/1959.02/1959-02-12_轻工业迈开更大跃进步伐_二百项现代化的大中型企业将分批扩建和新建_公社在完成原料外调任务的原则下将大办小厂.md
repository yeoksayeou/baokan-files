Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Under the new situation of the overall leap forward in the national economy and the increasing purchasing power of the people, China's light industry will achieve greater development in 1959. Recently, the Ministry of Light Industry has formulated this year's leap forward plan for light industry in accordance with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

From this leap forward plan, the growth of China's light industrial production in 1959 will be greater than in any previous year. The growth rate of major products has been arranged differently according to the urgency of raw material supply and market needs. For example, sugar, paper, salt, and other products will have a substantial increase compared to last year.

This year, China's light industry sector will also continue to build and expand a number of modern enterprises on a larger scale. About two hundred large and medium-sized modern enterprises are planned for expansion and new construction this year. In order to ensure key projects and accelerate construction speed, these projects will be started in batches according to needs and possibilities. As there is a large demand for paper, salt, etc. from all sectors, the paper and salt industries have been listed as the key points in the development of light industry this year. There are currently more than eighty paper industry construction projects under construction or about to begin construction.

In view of the fact that about 60% of China's light industrial raw materials (excluding textiles) come from rural areas, and the products are mainly sold in rural areas, the construction of light industry must continue to implement the "walking on two legs" policy, that is, in addition to establishing the necessary large and medium-sized modern enterprises, all localities must also vigorously run light industry factories in the people's communes on the principle of ensuring the completion of the task of transferring light industrial raw materials. Practice has proved that the large-scale establishment of light industry by the people's communes is a major step in accelerating the development of light industry. According to incomplete statistics, at least more than 300,000 small light industrial factories were newly built in various places in the second half of last year alone, and it has become an indispensable force in China's light industrial production. Further opposing conservative ideas, vigorously carrying out technical revolution, and focusing the technical revolution on saving raw materials, using substitutes, and improving production efficiency are major measures for light industry to achieve the leap forward plan this year. In order to solve the urgent need for chemical raw materials and metal materials in light industry, the paper industry will take measures such as alkali recovery, indigenous pulping methods, lime pulping, and using wine brewing before pulping to save alkali consumption. Many metal products will improve product structure design to save steel while ensuring product quality. While taking measures for saving and substitution, the light industry system plans to organize some production in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places with a chemical production base, using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, to produce the urgently needed chemical raw materials.

    轻工业迈开更大跃进步伐
    二百项现代化的大中型企业将分批扩建和新建 
   公社在完成原料外调任务的原则下将大办小厂
    新华社11日讯　在国民经济全面跃进、人民购买力日益增长的新形势下，1959年我国轻工业将获得更大的发展。最近轻工业部已经按照中共八届六中全会精神，制订了今年轻工业跃进规划。
    从这个跃进规划来看，1959年我国轻工业生产的增长将比过去任何一年都大。主要产品增长的速度，都已根据原料供应和市场需要，分别轻重缓急作了不同的安排。如糖、纸、盐和其他产品都将比去年有很大增长。
    今年我国轻工业部门也将以更大的规模继续新建和扩建一批现代化企业。今年准备扩建和新建的现代化大中型企业约有二百个项目。为了保证重点，加速建设速度，这些工程将根据需要和可能，分批开始兴建。由于各方面对纸张、盐等的需要量很大，造纸工业和制盐工业都已列为今年轻工业发展中的重点，目前正在建设和即将施工的造纸工业建设项目有八十多个。
    鉴于我国轻工业原料60％左右（不包括纺织）来自农村，产品也主要销售在农村，轻工业的建设必须继续贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，即除了建立必要的大中型现代化的企业以外，各地在保证完成轻工业原料外调任务的原则下，还要在人民公社大办轻工业工厂。实践证明，人民公社大办轻工业是加速轻工业发展速度的重大步骤。据不完全统计，仅在去年下半年期间，各地新建的小型轻工业工厂至少在三十万个以上，它已成为我国轻工业生产上的一支不可忽视的力量。进一步反对保守思想，大闹技术革命，并且把技术革命的中心放在节约原材料、使用代用品和提高生产效率方面，是今年轻工业实现跃进规划的重大措施。为了解决轻工业迫切需要的化工原料和金属材料供应问题，造纸工业将采取碱回收、土法制浆、石灰制浆和用先酿酒后制浆等办法，来节省碱的消耗量。许多金属制品，将在保证产品质量的前提下，改进产品结构设计，以节约钢材。在采取节约代用的措施同时，对于迫切需要的化工原料，轻工业系统准备在有化工生产基础的上海、天津等地，采用土洋结合的办法组织一些生产。
