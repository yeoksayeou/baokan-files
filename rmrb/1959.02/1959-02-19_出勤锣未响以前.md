    Before the Work Gong Sounds…
    On the morning of January 30th, before dawn, Ye Zhaoxiang, the captain of the Xiajie Production Team of the Zengjiang Commune in Zengcheng County, Guangdong Province, woke up to the sound of people outside. He asked his wife, who was combing her hair, "What time is it?" His wife replied, "Just after five o'clock." Ye Zhaoxiang grabbed his flashlight and ran outside. He saw commune members eagerly rushing to hang small signs with their names on the attendance board. Then, taking advantage of the moonlight, the commune members pushed carts, transporting fertilizer to the fields, creating a noisy scene. Ye Zhaoxiang approached the attendance board and, with the flashlight, saw that almost all the attending commune members had hung their signs, even though the work gong hadn't sounded yet! Ye Zhaoxiang quickly pushed his cart to deliver fertilizer. However, commune members in the Qiaotou, Taiping, and Qingyan management areas of the commune had started work even earlier, with streams of people transporting fertilizer already appearing on the field paths.
    The Zengjiang Commune members' conscious early start to accumulate fertilizer had been observed for many days. The commune party committee felt that issuing an order to prohibit it wasn't appropriate and had told the cadres to appropriately advise the commune members to pay attention to rest. However, the commune members said, "If we get enough sleep, getting up a little earlier to deliver more fertilizer will mean we can harvest an extra pound of grain in the future!"
    This day was the third day of the second concentrated fertilizer accumulation week in Zengcheng County. Over 128,000 people, accounting for 64% of the labor force, were driving over 79,000 various handcarts, chicken carts, ox-drawn trains, earth cranes, land boats, and mud-transporting boats, throwing themselves into the upsurge of accumulating and transporting fertilizer. As usual, the commune members in the five management areas of the Xiancun Commune held a vigorous fertilizer delivery charge for about an hour before each meal. Their slogan was, "Charge forward, race against time!" The gongs and drums thundered, and the commune members all stripped off their sleeves, ready to go. As soon as the gongs and drums stopped, the commune members operated their various fertilizer-transporting tools and sprinted, and for a time, shouts of "Charge!" and "Add oil!" echoed across the fields. Some commune members, after delivering fertilizer to the fields, sang mountain songs while returning to load more fertilizer: "Commune members are all full of energy, the carts are loaded with fertilizer, a thousand red hearts accumulating fertilizer, all for ten thousand catties of grain!" The youth shock brigade of the Zhenlong management area of the Zhongxin Commune also automatically blew their whistles to assemble after dinner, first lighting the lights to start night work. Soon, along the two-li stretch of fields on both sides of the road, more than two thousand people gathered, busily digging ditch mud, repairing paths, and burning soil with smoke, a scene of heavy smoke in the lights. In the villages, many commune members were also rushing to dismantle old houses, weave manure baskets, and repair carts, the clanging sounds clear and audible. Since the beginning of the first concentrated fertilizer accumulation week, commune members from several communes have spontaneously rushed to repair carts and build convenient fertilizer transportation paths at night.
    At present, Zengcheng County has basically realized cart mechanization, accumulating more than 1.2 billion dan of fertilizer, averaging more than 3,200 dan of fertilizer per mu of early rice area, and has delivered more than 630 million dan of fertilizer to the fields. 60% of the early rice fields have been fertilized with more than 2,800 dan per mu, exceeding the county party committee's requirement of accumulating 2,500 dan of fertilizer per mu. The fertilizer accumulation and delivery movement in this county is rising step by step. Before the Spring Festival, they will successfully overcome the fertilizer hurdle, laying a solid foundation for a greater leap forward in rice production this year.

    出勤锣未响以前……
    1月30日早晨，天还未亮，广东省增城县增江公社夏街生产队队长叶兆祥一觉醒来，听见屋外人声嘈杂，便问正在梳洗的妻子：“几点钟了？”妻子答：“才五点多。”叶兆祥拿了手电筒就往屋外跑，只见社员们正争先恐后地抢着在考勤牌上挂上写着自己名字的小牌牌。随后社员们便趁着月色，推动车子，把肥泥往田里送，咿咿呀呀一片喧闹。叶兆祥走近考勤牌前，用手电一照，出勤的社员差不多都挂上牌了，而这时的出勤锣声还未打响呢！叶兆祥也赶快推车送肥去。可是，这个公社的桥头、太平、清燕等管理区的社员，出工更早，田间道路上已陆陆续续出现送肥的人群。
    增江公社社员们自觉地提早开工积肥的情况，已经发现许多天了，公社党委觉得下命令禁止不大好，曾经对干部说，要适当劝社员注意休息。但是，社员们说：“觉睡足了，早起一会儿多送担肥，将来就能多收一斤谷啊！”
    这天，是增城县开始第二次突击积肥周的第三天，全县有占劳动力64％的十二万八千多人，驾驶着各种手推车、鸡公车、牛拉列车、土起重机、陆上行舟和运泥船艇等七万九千多部，投入积肥送肥的热潮中。仙村公社五个管理区的社员们，这天照例在每顿饭前一个钟头左右的时间，举行声势勇猛的冲锋送肥。他们的口号是，“打冲锋，争时间！”锣鼓雷鸣了，社员个个脱光臂膀，做好准备；锣鼓声一停，只见社员们操纵着各种运肥工具飞奔，一时间，“冲呀！”“加油呀！”的呼喝声，响遍田野。有的社员把肥送下田后，再回头装肥时，高唱山歌道：“社员个个劲头强，车子的肥载满箱，千颗红心积肥料，一切为了万斤粮！”中新公社镇龙管理区的青年突击队，这天吃过晚饭，也自动吹哨集合，首先点起灯火开夜工。很快地，在公路两旁长约二里的田野上，便聚集了二千多人在紧张地挖渠泥、修便道、烧火熏土，一片灯光里，抹上重重烟雾。村子里，还有许多社员赶着拆旧屋、编粪箕和修理车子，叮叮当当的响声，清脆可闻。自从第一次突击积肥周开始以来，好几个公社的社员都自发地赶夜装修车子和开筑送肥便道。
    目前，增城县已基本实现了车子化，积制到肥料十二亿多担，按早稻面积平均每亩有肥三千二百多担，已送肥下田六亿三千多万担，有60％的早稻田每亩送下肥料二千八百多担，超过了县委提出每亩积肥二千五百担的要求。这个县的积肥送肥运动正在步步高涨，春节前，他们将完满越过肥料关，为今年水稻生产更大的跃进打下坚实的基础。
