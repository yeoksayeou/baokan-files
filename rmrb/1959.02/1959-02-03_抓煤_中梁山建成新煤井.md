    Seizing Coal
    Zhongliangshan Completes New Coal Mine
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 2nd. A modern large-scale mine in Southwest China, the South Mine of the Chongqing Zhongliangshan Coal Mine, was officially put into production at the end of January, nine months ahead of schedule. The North Mine, which is under intense construction, will soon be completed and put into production as well.
    The commissioning of these two coal mines will be of great significance in promoting a greater leap forward in Chongqing's industrial production this year.
    Construction of the South Mine of Zhongliangshan Coal Mine began in September 1955. It was explored, designed, and built by Chinese workers themselves with the help of Soviet experts, and all the equipment and materials used were made in China. The underground tunnels of this mine alone are twenty-two li long, and two electric locomotives can run side by side. The entire production process here—from pneumatic pick coal mining, transportation, drainage, hoisting, to washing and sorting—is entirely operated by machinery.

    抓煤
    中梁山建成新煤井
    据新华社重庆2日电  西南地区一座现代化大型矿井——重庆中梁山煤矿的南井，提前九个月在1月底正式投入生产。正在紧张建设的北矿井，不久也将建成投入生产。
    这两个煤井的投入生产，对于促进重庆今年工业生产的更大跃进将有重大意义。
    中梁山煤矿南井在1955年9月开始兴建。它是在苏联专家帮助下，由我国职工自行勘探、设计，并且全部用国产的设备、材料兴建起来的。这座矿井单是井下掘进的巷道，就有二十二华里长，两辆电机车可以并排行驶。这里的整个生产过程——从风镐落煤、运输、排水、提升到洗选，全部由机械操作。
